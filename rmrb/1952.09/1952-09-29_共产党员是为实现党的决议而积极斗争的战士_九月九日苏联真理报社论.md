    The Leninist-Stalinist party organizes and inspires the entire work of our country's communist construction. In its activities, it relies on the support and boundless trust of the Soviet people.

    Comrade Stalin said: "No party has ever enjoyed such high prestige among the people as our Bolshevik party has, both in the past and at present. This is very obvious. Under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, our workers, peasants, and intellectuals have achieved freedom and built a socialist society."

    The Communist Party is a fighting and conscious organization, good at actively thinking and closely connecting with reality, daring to destroy the old and create the new. Our party's strength lies in the unity and solidarity of its ranks, and in the initiative of the party members. The Party continuously cares about consolidating Party organizations at all levels, enhancing their fighting capacity, and promoting the initiative and consciousness of Party members. The Party educates its members with a high sense of responsibility to the Party's cause. Everywhere—in enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, machine tractor stations, state farms, and government offices—Communist Party members are organizers fighting for the implementation of the Party's policies and the execution of the Party's resolutions.

    The new tasks facing our Party in building a communist society require us to continuously improve the working standards of Party organizations at all levels, further promote the initiative of the Party members, and vigorously consolidate Party and state discipline. The activities of every Party organization, its connection with the masses, and its influence on the broad masses of working people depend on whether our members and alternate members actively participate in the work of the Party organization.

    Our Party's leaders and organizers—Lenin and Stalin—taught that only those who participate in the work of their Party organization, regard integrating their hopes with the Party's hopes and acting jointly with the Party as their duty, can be called Communist Party members.

    Comrade Stalin instructed: "The Party is not only a union of like-minded people, but also a union of like-acting people. It is a fighting union of like-acting people struggling on the basis of common ideas..."

    Communist Party members should dedicate all their energy, knowledge, and talents to the great cause of communist construction. Every action of a Party member should be subordinate to the interests of the public cause and the interests of the Party and the state. One of the important requirements for Communist Party members in the draft revision of the Party Constitution submitted by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) for discussion at the Nineteenth Congress is: to actively struggle for the implementation of the Party's resolutions.

    The draft revision of the Party Constitution states: "It is not enough for a Party member to merely agree with the Party's resolutions; a Party member has the obligation to strive to implement these resolutions. A Communist Party member's passive and perfunctory attitude towards the Party's resolutions will inevitably weaken the Party's fighting capacity; therefore, it is incompatible with the status of a Party member."

    The lofty title of Communist Party member obligates Communist Party members to implement the Party's policies and resolutions with unwavering spirit. For Communist Party members, struggling to implement the Party's resolutions should be a glorious cause and fulfilling a noble duty to the Party. However, it must also be pointed out that we still have some Party members who adopt a perfunctory and passive attitude towards implementing the Party's resolutions, and they do not practically participate in Party life. This is an extremely bad phenomenon that must be resolutely opposed.

    At the current Party representative conferences being held in various districts, cities, and provinces, the representatives have justly criticized those Party members who lack the necessary initiative and unwavering spirit in completing their entrusted work, who deviate from the practical work of implementing the Party's instructions and the resolutions of the higher-level Party organizations, and who therefore violate Party discipline.

    The representatives at the Stalin City Party Representative Conference in Kemerovo Oblast unanimously pointed out in their speeches the incorrect attitude of many economic workers towards the Party's resolutions. The conference specifically mentioned Comrades Shizhko and Karbuzov, the leaders of the "Stalinshtaka Industrial Construction" Trust and the "Kuznets Industrial Construction" Trust, who often fail to implement resolutions concerning the activities of their respective organizations. As a result, the work of these two trusts is unsatisfactory, and they have failed to fulfill the established plans. Similar situations exist in other Party organizations. At the Bol City Party Representative Conference in Gorky Oblast, it was mentioned that the secretaries and members of the municipal committee had not drawn the necessary conclusions from the criticisms and had not taken effective measures to overcome the shortcomings in the work of Party organizations at all levels. The municipal committee also did a poor job in educating leading cadres with a high sense of responsibility for completing state tasks, and they did not conduct the necessary struggle against complacency and tolerance. After passing resolutions on important issues of political and economic activity, the municipal committee did not consolidate them with organizational work and did not conduct daily supervision and inspection of the implementation of these resolutions.

    Consistency between words and deeds, consistency between resolutions and implementation—this is an important requirement that our Party puts forward to every worker and every Party member, regardless of his position. Once a resolution is passed, the focus of the problem shifts to the specific work of implementing the resolution. At this time, the task of the Party organization is to attract all members and alternate members to participate in this work.

    Practical work to implement the Party's resolutions can promote the growth of Party members and cultivate their organizational skills. Well-organized inspection of implementation can consolidate Party and state discipline and enhance Party members' sense of responsibility for fulfilling their duties. It is necessary to combine top-down inspection with bottom-up inspection in order to attract the broad masses of Party members to participate in this work.

    Only through practical work, through struggling with difficulties and overcoming difficulties, can cadres be truly tempered. Unfortunately, many of our local Party organizations are not seriously concerned with the issue of enhancing the initiative of Party members and alternate members. It was pointed out at the re-election conference of the Party organization of the Novo-Turshka factory that a large number of Party members did not participate in social and political life and did not undertake any entrustment from the Party. Due to the relaxation of educational work for Party members, violations of Party and labor discipline continued to occur among Party members.

    The most basic duty of Party organizations is to constantly work with every Party member, help them improve their ideological and political level, educate them to bravely and resolutely overcome the various difficulties they encounter, and cultivate their sensitivity to new things. Party organizations must ensure that every Party member actively participates in the struggle to implement the instructions of the Party and the government and the resolutions of the Party organization.

    The Party requires Party members to demonstrate creative initiative and a leading role at all times and in all places, to be models of a communist attitude towards labor and public property, to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against the old, and to actively support the nascent, progressive, and advanced. Communist Party members should daily strengthen their connection with the masses, promptly reflect the demands and needs of the working people, explain the Party's policies and resolutions to non-Party members, and always remember that the strength and invincibility of our Party lies in its inseparable flesh-and-blood connection with the people.

    The draft revision of the Party Constitution requires Party members to carry out criticism from bottom to top, expose shortcomings in their work and strive to eliminate them, and oppose superficial achievements and being blinded by achievements in their work. Only in an environment of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism can our cadres and all Communist Party members receive correct education and tempering.

    In the face of the huge new tasks facing our country, our Party has raised the requirements for Party members. The title of Communist Party member should be further elevated. This is a guarantee for further consolidating our Party's ranks and enhancing its fighting capacity.

    共产党员是为实现党的决议而积极斗争的战士
    ——九月九日苏联真理报社论
    列宁斯大林的党，组织并鼓舞着我国共产主义建设的整个工作。它在自己的活动中所依靠的，是苏维埃人民对它的支持和无限信任。
    斯大林同志说：“没有任何一个政党能像我们布尔什维克党一样，无论过去和现在都在人民群众中享有这样高的威信。这是很明显的事。在布尔什维克的领导下，我国的工人，农民及知识分子取得了自由并建设了社会主义社会。”
    共产党是一个战斗的自动的组织，它善于积极思考和密切联系现实生活，它敢于摧毁陈旧的并创造出新的。我们党之所以有力量，就在于队伍的统一与团结，在于党员群众底积极性。党对巩固各级地方党的组织，提高其战斗力，发扬党员的积极性与自动性，给予了不断的关怀。党以对党的事业底高度责任心教育着党员。在各个角落里——在企业部门、建筑部门、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农庄和各机关里——，共产党员都是为实现党的政策和执行党的决议而斗争的组织者。
    在建设共产主义社会中，我党所面临的新任务，要求我们不断提高各级地方党组织底工作水平，进一步发扬党员群众的积极性，和大力巩固党和国家的纪律。每一个党组织的活动，它与群众的联系，它对广大劳动人民群众的影响，都取决于一点：即我们的党员和候补党员是否都积极地参加了党组织的工作。
    我们党的领袖与组织者——列宁和斯大林教导说，只有参加自己党组织的工作，能把自己的希望溶合于党的希望之中并和党采取共同行动看作自己的义务的人，才可称为共产党员。
    斯大林同志指示说：“党不只是同一思想者的联
    合，同时，它又是同一行动者的联合。是在共同思想的基础上进行斗争的同一行动者底战斗联合……”
    共产党员应将自己全部的精力、知识和才能供献给伟大的共产主义建设事业。党员的一举一动都应服从公共事业底利益，服从党和国家的利益。在联共（布）中央提交第十九次代表大会讨论的党章的修正草案中，对共产党员提出的重要要求之一就是：为实现党的决议而积极斗争。
    党章的修正草案中载明：“对于党员来说，仅仅同意党的决议是不够的，党员有义务为实现这些决议而奋斗。共产党员对党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度，就必然会削弱党的战斗力，因此，这是和党员的身份不相容的”。
    共产党员的崇高称号责成共产党员以坚毅的精神实现党的政策和决议。对于共产党员来说，为实现党的决议而斗争应该是光荣的事业，是对党履行崇高的义务。然而，也必须指出，我们现在尚有一些这样的党员，他们对实现党的决议采取阳奉阴违的消极态度，他们不实地参加党的生活。这是一种必须坚决反对的极其恶劣的现象。
    在目前各区、市和省正举行的党代表会议上，代表们对那些在完成其受付托的工作中缺乏应有的积极性和坚毅精神，脱离了为执行党的指示和上级党的决议所进行的实际工作，因而破坏党纪的党员们，提出了公正的批评。
    克蔑洛沃州斯大林市党代表会议的代表们，在发言中都一致指出许多经济工作者对待党的决议的不正确态度。会上曾特别提到“斯大林什喀工业建筑”托辣斯和“库斯涅兹工业建筑”托辣斯的领导者什兹科同志和喀尔布佐夫同志，他们经常不执行有关其所属机关底活动的决议。结果这两个托辣斯的工作都不能令人满意，它们没有完成既定的计划。其他党组织里也有类似情况。在高尔基省波尔市党代表会议上曾提到市委会的各位书记和委员，他们没有从批评中作出应有的结论，没有采取有效的措施克服各级党组织中的工作缺点。以完成国家任务的高度责任心的精神来教育领导干部的工作，市委会也作得很差，他们没有同自安自慰和宽容的情绪进行应有的斗争。市委会在通过了有关政治经济活动重要问题的决议后，没有用组织工作来巩固它们，没有对这些决议的执行情况进行日常的监督检查。
    言行一致，决议和执行一致——这是我们党向每一个工作人员，每一个党员不管他的职位如何，所提出的重要要求。决议既经通过，问题的重心即转移到为实现决议所进行的具体工作。这时，党组织的任务就在于吸引所有的党员和候补党员来参加这项工作。
    为实现党的决议所进行的实际工作，能促进党员底成长并培养他们的组织技能。组织得很好的对执行情况的检查，能够巩固党和国家的纪律，提高党员对完成其所任职务的责任感。必须把自上而下的检查与自下而上的检查结合起来，以便吸引广大党员群众参加这一工作。
    只有通过实际工作，通过与困难作斗争及克服困难，才能使干部受到真正的锻炼。可惜我们许多地方党组织现在还没有认真关怀提高党员及候补党员积极性的问题。在诺沃土尔什喀工厂党组织的改选大会上已经指明，很大一部分党员没有参与社会政治生活，没有承担党的任何付托。由于放松了对党员的教育工作，所以党员之中破坏党和劳动纪律的事情才不断发生。
    党组织的最基本职责，就是要经常向每一个党员进行工作，帮助他们提高思想政治水平，教育他们勇敢坚决地克服碰到的各种困难，培养他们对新鲜事物的感觉。党组织必须作到使每一个党员都积极参加到为实现党和政府的指示及党组织的决议所进行的斗争中来。
    党要求党员随时随地都要表现出创造的主动性和带头作用，要成为以共产主义态度对待劳动和公有财产的榜样，要与陈旧的事物进行不调和的斗争，并积极支持新生的，进步的和先进的。共产党员应每日巩固与群众的联系，及时反映劳动人民的要求和需要，向非党群众解释党的政策和决议，时时记住我党之所以有力量和不可战胜就在于它和人民有着不可分割的血肉联系。
    党章的修正草案要求党员展开自下而上的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力加以消灭，反对表面成绩，反对因为工作中的成绩而冲昏头脑。只有在布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的环境中，才能使我们的干部和所有的共产党员受到正确的教育及锻炼。
    在我们国家所面临的巨大的新任务的前面，我们党提高了对党员的要求。共产党员的称号应该更加提高。这便是进一步巩固我们党的队伍和提高其战斗力的保证。
