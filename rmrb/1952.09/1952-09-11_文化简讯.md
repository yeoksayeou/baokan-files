    Southwest University Graduates Take Up Construction Work

    This summer, 2,882 graduates from universities and colleges in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces in the Southwest region, after a short period of study during the summer, have now happily taken up various construction work positions in the motherland.  Graduating students from five universities in Chengdu, Sichuan, wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "We are excited and pleased to report to you that more than 1,000 graduating classmates in Chengdu have completed their studies and will, through unified assignment by the People's Government, embark on various construction work positions most needed by the motherland." Among the graduates from universities and colleges in the Southwest region this time, 60 medical students will be assigned to minority areas in the Southwest and old revolutionary base areas in the former Sichuan-Shaanxi border area to carry out health and medical work.

    Correction: In the translation of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1" by You Jin, published on page 3 of this newspaper on September 10, the quoted passage in the 25th to 28th lines of the fifth column: "'...The People's Republic represents the interests of the people of all strata who are anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces. The government of the People's Republic is dominated by workers and peasants, and at the same time accommodates other classes of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces.' (Page 157)" should be changed to: "'...The People's Republic removes the oppression of imperialism, making China free and independent, and removes the oppression of landlords, leading China away from the semi-feudal system. These things not only benefit the workers and peasants, but also benefit other people.' (Page 156)".
