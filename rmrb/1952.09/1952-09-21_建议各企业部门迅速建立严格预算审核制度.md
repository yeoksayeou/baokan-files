    Suggesting that all Enterprise Departments Rapidly Establish Strict Budget Review Systems
    To the Editor: The Dezhou Industrial Company of Shandong Province, due to a lax budget review system, caused great waste in capital construction. When the company commissioned the making of floorboards this year, they went ahead without reviewing the budget beforehand. It was only when the company's finance department reviewed the final accounts that they realized these floorboards were made of pine, costing twenty0,000 yuan more per piece than if they had been made of ordinary wood. The company's recent purchase of bicycles also lacked detailed investigation and rigorous review. They simply tallied the numbers reported by each unit and went to the department store to buy them, which also resulted in significant waste. The Lihua Oil Factory, under the company's umbrella, has only about forty employees and already had five bicycles. This time, the company bought them another seven, but they actually don't need that many.
    The above situation, I believe, is not unique to Dezhou Industrial Company. Therefore, I suggest that relevant enterprise departments should quickly establish a strict budget review system to prevent unnecessary losses of state assets.  Fan Ling

    建议各企业部门迅速建立严格预算审核制度
    编辑同志：山东省德州实业公司在基本建设中，因预算审核制度不严，造成很大浪费。该公司在今年定做铺板时，事先没有审核预算就去订制，等到公司财务科审查决算时，才发觉这些铺板是用松木做的，每件铺板比用一般木料做的要多花二十万元。该公司最近购买自行车，也没有经过详细调查和严密审核，只把各单位上报的数目统计起来，就到百货公司去购买，结果也造成了很大浪费。该公司所属利华油厂只有约四十个工作人员，原来已有五辆自行车，这次公司又给他们买了七辆，但他们实际上并不需要那么多。
    以上情况，想来不仅德州实业公司有。因此，我建议有关企业部门，应迅速建立起严格的预算审核制度，免使国家资财造成不应有的损失。  范凌
