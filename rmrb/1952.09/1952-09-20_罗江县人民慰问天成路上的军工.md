    Luo Jiang County People Extend Sympathies to Military Workers on the Tiancheng Road
    To the Editor: Since entering the construction site on July 1 this year, the military workers of a certain division participating in the Tian (Shui) Cheng (Du) Railway construction project, under the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels of the division, have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm. In the months of July and August, when there was a lot of autumn rain, the military workers persisted in road construction work in the rain and mud, and actively improved technology to increase work efficiency. In order to express their gratitude and support to the military workers, the people of Luojiang County, Sichuan, formed a delegation to visit the construction site and offer their condolences. The military workers unanimously expressed that they would transform the condolences of the people of Luojiang into strength and strive to complete the Tiancheng Railway task ahead of schedule in order to repay the care of the people of Luojiang County. After the慰问团 left, the military workers of a certain company held a meeting and decided to insert a bouquet of red flowers presented by the children on the construction site and launch a "compete for red flowers" competition to strive for meritorious service for the people.
    This visit also educated the representatives who participated in the visit. Farmer representative Yang Zongwan said, "After returning this time, I will definitely get the mutual aid group going, produce more grain, and support the military workers in completing the Tiancheng Railway task as soon as possible." After returning, Wang Mingfu, a young pioneer team member, told everyone he met: "The PLA uncles are working hard to build the Tiancheng Railway, isn't it for us to live a happy life? I must study hard and serve the people of the motherland."

    罗江县人民慰问天成路上的军工
    编辑同志：参加修筑天（水）成（都）铁路铁道工程的某师军工，自今年七月一日进入工地施工后，在该师各级党委的正确领导下，发挥了高度的劳动热情，在七、八两月秋雨较多的日子里，军工们在雨里泥里坚持筑路工作，并积极改进技术，提高工作效率。为了表示对军工们的感谢和支援，四川罗江县人民组成了慰问队，分赴工地慰问。军工们一致表示把罗江人民的慰问变成力量，争取提前完成天成铁路任务，以报答罗江县人民的关怀。某连军工们在慰问团走后，开会决定把少年儿童们赠送的一束红花，插在工地上，展开“夺红花”竞赛，争取为人民立功。
    这次慰问也教育了参加慰问的代表。农民代表杨宗万说：“这次回去后一定把互助组搞起来，多打粮食，支援军工早日完成天成铁路任务”。少年儿童队员王明富回来后，逢人便说：“解放军叔叔不辞辛苦修筑天成铁路，还不是为了我们过幸福生活，我一定要学好本领，为祖国人民服务。”
