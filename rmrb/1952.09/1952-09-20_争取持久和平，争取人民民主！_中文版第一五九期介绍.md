The issue No. 159 of the Chinese edition of the Cominform's organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue devotes considerable space to publishing the important documents recently released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Notification of the convocation of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Draft Directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union for 1951-1955, and the full text of the Draft Amendments to the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

This issue also includes an article by Chișinevschi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, commemorating the eighth anniversary of the glorious Soviet Army's liberation of Romania on August 23rd: "The Great Festival of the Romanian People's Liberation." In his article, Chișinevschi analyzes the remarkable achievements of Romania in industry, agriculture, and people's welfare since its liberation, and emphasizes that the tasks currently facing the Romanian Workers' Party are: to continue to resolutely implement socialist industrialization, consolidate the alliance between the working class and the working peasants, ensure the socialist transformation of agriculture, and unswervingly implement the policy of restricting and eliminating capitalist elements. Chișinevschi concludes by saying that the establishment and consolidation of people's democratic countries, friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's selfless assistance and support guarantee the independence, national sovereignty, development, and prosperity of the Romanian People's Republic. Therefore, as the Romanian people look back on the path they have traveled in the eight years since liberation and assess the development of events on the international stage, they are more confident in the correctness of the Party's policies and more determined to follow this policy to the end.

Another important article in this issue is "The French People Take Action Against the Bonn Separate Treaty and the 'Schuman Plan'" by Berlioz, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. Berlioz says that the aggressive plans of the American imperialists in Europe have aroused growing unease among the people of various countries. In France, this unease has been particularly evident since the full texts of the aggressive Bonn Treaty and the agreement on the so-called "European Defense Community" were published. The signing of these military treaties is the result of the French big bourgeoisie's policy of systematically selling out national interests and preparing for a new war. Berlioz exposes the conspiracy of the Bonn Separate Treaty to foster West German revanchists in preparation for a new war and its nature of undermining French sovereignty; and analyzes the contradictions between imperialists on the "Schuman Plan" issue. He emphasizes that the French government's anti-people policy of selling out national interests has met with increasing resistance. In the past, some people believed that war was inevitable due to unavoidable reasons; now, these people see that the imperialist camp is now being resisted by the people; the people are capable of stopping the war. Berlioz concludes by recounting the successive victories of the French people's struggle, saying that the French people's courageous anti-war struggle has been effective. France is currently launching a campaign to prepare for the World People's Peace Congress. The French peace movement has put forward a correct task, demanding that this preparatory movement focus on opposing the ratification of the Bonn Treaty and the "European Army" treaty, because these two treaties subject France to the domination of the currently reviving German militarism and German imperialism. The French peace movement correctly points out that refusing to ratify these treaties will accelerate the advent of negotiations and contribute to a fundamental and peaceful solution to the German question.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五九期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五九期已经出版。
    本期以大量篇幅刊载了苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会最近发布的重要文件：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会关于召开第十九次代表大会的通知、苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划的指示草案、苏联共产党关于党章的修正草案全文。
    本期还刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记契西尼夫斯奇庆祝八月二十三日光荣的苏军解放罗马尼亚八周年纪念的文章：“罗马尼亚人民获得解放的伟大节日”。契西尼夫斯奇在文章中分析了罗马尼亚从解放以来在工业、农业和人民福利等方面的卓著成就，并且强调指出：罗马尼亚工人党目前所面临的任务是：继续坚决地实行社会主义工业化、巩固工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟、保证农业进行社会主义改造及坚持不渝地实行限制与排除资本主义成分的政策。契西尼夫斯奇最后说：人民民主国家的建立和巩固，对伟大的苏联的友谊和联盟以及苏联的无私的援助和支持，保证了罗马尼亚人民共和国的独立、国家主权、发展及繁荣。因此，罗马尼亚人民回顾解放以来八年中所经历的道路，估计了国际舞台事态的发展，他们更加信任党的政策的正确，并更加决心追随这个政策到底。
    本期另一篇重要文章是法国共产党中央委员会委员贝利奥兹的“法国人民采取行动反对波恩单独条约和‘舒曼计划’”。贝利奥兹说：美帝国主义者在欧洲的侵略计划引起了各国人民日益增长的不安情绪。在法国，自从侵略性的波恩条约和关于所谓“欧洲防御集团”的协定的全文公布了以后，这种不安情绪特别来得明显。这些军事性条约的签订，是法国大资产阶级执行有计划地出卖民族利益和准备新战争的政策的结果。贝利奥兹揭露了波恩单独条约扶植西德报复主义分子准备新战争的阴谋及其损害法国主权的性质；并分析了帝国主义间在“舒曼计划”问题上的矛盾。他强调指出：法国政府出卖本国利益的反人民政策已遭到愈来愈大的反抗。过去，有些人认为由于无可避免的原因使得战争必然会爆发；现在，这些人看出了帝国主义阵营现在正在遭到人民的抵抗；人民是能够阻止战争的。贝利奥兹最后在叙述了法国人民斗争的历次胜利后说：法国人民的勇敢的反对战争的斗争收到了效果。法国目前正在展开筹备世界人民和平大会的运动。法国和平拥护者的运动提出了一项正确的任务，他们要求这个筹备运动要集中注意于反对批准波恩条约和“欧洲军”条约，因为这两个条约使法国受目前正在复活的德国军国主义和德国帝国主义的支配。法国和平拥护者运动正确地指出：拒绝批准这些条约就会加速谈判的到来并且对于德国问题的根本的和平解决有所贡献。（新华社）
