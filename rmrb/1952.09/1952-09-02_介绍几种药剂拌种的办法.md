    Introduction to Several Methods of Seed Dressing with Pesticides
    Editor: Winter wheat will soon be sown. In order to prevent diseases and insect pests from occurring after wheat is sown, farmers in many areas are practicing seed dressing with pesticides. In the past, some farmers experienced phytotoxicity due to improper use of pesticides, which affected seedling emergence; or the pesticide efficacy was not significant, failing to achieve the purpose of preventing diseases and insect pests. Therefore, when using pesticides for seed dressing, special attention should be paid to the dosage and method of seed dressing. When using "Ceresan" for seed dressing, the most appropriate dosage is two pounds of pesticide per thousand pounds of wheat seeds. When using copper carbonate or copper oxychloride for seed dressing, the dosage should be determined according to local customs and the effective ingredients of the pesticide. The seeds for dressing should be dry and thoroughly mixed. Using "666" pesticide powder and millet or wheat bran to make poisoned bait can lure and kill mole crickets and locusts. An appropriate method is: using one tael of 6.5% "666" powder and three catties of millet to make poisoned grain can lure and kill mole crickets (using "666" powder to dress wheat seeds can prevent wireworms. The ratio is five qian and five fen of pesticide powder per ten catties of wheat seeds. The wheat seeds should be dry, and the mixing should be even); using two catties of 2.5% "666" powder or ten catties of 0.5% "666" powder and one hundred catties of wheat bran, and one hundred catties of water to make poisoned bait (using eight or nine catties per mu is sufficient) can poison and kill locusts. When making poisoned bait, first mix the pesticide powder and wheat bran (if using fine bran, the amount can be less than coarse bran) extremely evenly, then slowly add water and mix evenly. The poisoned bait should be used in a timely manner to prevent it from becoming ineffective over time.

    介绍几种药剂拌种的办法
    编辑同志：冬小麦很快就要播种了。为了预防小麦在播种后发生病害和虫害，许多地区的农民实行了药剂拌种。过去有些农民因为用药不当，或者发生药害，影响了出苗；或者药效不大，不能达到预防病虫害的目的。因此，在采用药剂拌种时，要十分注意用药量和拌种的方法。用“赛力散”拌种时，最适当的用量是麦种一千斤，药剂二斤。用碳酸铜或王铜拌种时，用量应根据当地的习惯和药剂的有效成分来决定。拌种的种籽要干燥，并且要充分拌匀。用“六六六”药粉和小米或麦麸制成毒饵，可以诱杀蝼蛄和土蝗。适当的办法是：用一两百分之六点五的“六六六”粉和三斤小米做成毒谷，可以诱杀蝼蛄（用“六六六”粉拌麦种，可以防治金针虫。分量是麦种十斤，药粉五钱五分。麦种要干，拌种要匀）；用二斤百分之二点五的“六六六”粉或十斤千分之五的“六六六”粉和麦麸一百斤、水一百斤制成毒饵（每亩地用八、九斤即可），可以毒杀土蝗。做毒饵时要先把药粉和麦麸（如用细麸，分量可比粗麸少些）和得极匀，然后慢慢加水拌匀。做成毒饵后要及时使用，以防过时失效。
