Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The people of Bulgaria are warmly celebrating the eighth anniversary of the National Day of the People's Republic of Bulgaria (September 9th).

    On September 8th, a grand celebration was held in Sofia. Yugov, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, delivered a speech at the meeting, first expressing sincere gratitude and respect for the great feat of the Soviet army in liberating the Bulgarian people from fascist enslavement eight years ago, and for the multifaceted assistance given by the Soviet government in Bulgaria's massive construction over the past eight years. Yugov then described Bulgaria's achievements in national industrialization and agricultural mechanization. He said that in the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan (1952), Bulgaria's total industrial output has exceeded the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1953 by 16.4 percent. There are now more than 12,000 tractors and more than 1,000 Soviet-made combines working in the fields, thereby reducing the labor of farmers, increasing labor productivity, and creating conditions for a happier and more cultured life in the countryside. The national income in 1951 increased by more than 30 percent compared with 1950, and this year's national income will increase by 19 percent compared with 1951. Yugov said, "We are now increasingly close to completing the construction of our socialist foundation, and are also increasingly close to the construction of the socialist edifice itself." Yugov pointed out that the victory of the general line of the Bulgarian Communist Party headed by Chervenkov is the victory of the line of establishing an eternal and solid friendship with the great Soviet Union; it is the victory of the line of friendly cooperation with the people's democratic countries, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, and the people of Korea and Vietnam; it is the victory of the line of infinite loyalty to the cause of proletarian internationalism. When discussing the struggle of the people of the world for peace and democracy, Yugov pointed out the historical significance of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and expressed the Bulgarian people's congratulations on the convening of the congress.
    Tarasov, head of the Soviet government delegation attending the celebration and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, delivered a congratulatory speech. The heads of the government delegations of the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia and other countries who attended the celebration also delivered congratulatory speeches.
    Before the end of the celebration, a telegram of tribute to Marshal Stalin was passed in high spirits.
    On September 9th, a grand military parade and a parade of 300,000 people were held in Sofia. From morning to night, Sofia's parks, stadiums, and playgrounds were filled with reveling people. They wore festive costumes, enthusiastically praised their liberator—the powerful Soviet Union, and shouted "Long live Stalin, the good friend of the Bulgarian people!"
    Celebrations were also held in other parts of Bulgaria.

    保加利亚全国人民热烈庆祝国庆八周年
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社消息：保加利亚全国人民热烈庆祝保加利亚人民共和国国庆（九月九日）八周年。
    九月八日，索非亚举行了隆重的庆祝会。保加利亚人民共和国部长会议副主席于哥夫在会上发表演说，首先对于苏联军队八年前把保加利亚人民从法西斯奴役下解放出来的伟大义举，和苏联政府八年来在保加利亚的巨大建设中所给予的多方面的援助，表示热诚的感谢和敬意。于哥夫继而叙述了保加利亚在国家工业化和农业机械化等方面的成就。他说：在五年计划第四年（一九五二年），保加利亚的工业总产量已超过五年计划所规定的一九五三年的水平百分之十六点四。现在全国有一万二千多辆拖拉机和一千多辆苏联造的联合机在田间工作，因而农民的劳动已减轻，劳动生产率已提高，给农村中更加欢乐的、有更高文化的生活创造了条件。一九五一年国民收入比一九五○年增加了百分之三十以上，而今年的国民收入还要比一九五一年增加百分之十九。于哥夫说：“现在我们日益接近完成我们社会主义基础的建设了，也日益接近社会主义大厦本身的建设了。”于哥夫指出，在以契尔文科夫为首的保加利亚共产党的总路线的胜利是和伟大苏联建立永恒坚固友谊的路线的胜利；是对人民民主国家，中华人民共和国、德意志民主共和国，对朝鲜和越南人民友好合作的路线的胜利；是对无产阶级国际主义事业无限忠诚的路线的胜利。于哥夫在论述世界人民争取和平与民主的斗争时，指出苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所具有的历史意义，并表示保加利亚人民祝贺代表大会的召开。
    出席庆祝大会的苏联政府代表团团长、俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席团主席塔拉索夫发表祝贺演说。参加庆祝会的中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克及其他各国政府代表团的团长也都发表了祝贺演说。
    庆祝大会结束前在高涨的情绪中通过了向斯大林大元帅致敬的电文。
    九月九日，索非亚曾举行盛大的阅兵典礼和三十万人的游行。从早到晚，索非亚的公园里，体育场里，游戏场里，都挤满了狂欢的人民。他们穿着节日的盛装，热烈地赞颂自己的解放者——强大的苏联，高呼保加利亚人民的好友斯大林万岁。
