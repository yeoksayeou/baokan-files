TASS, Moscow, 10th: The new Chinese film "New Heroes and Heroines" is being screened in Soviet cinemas and is proving very successful. Ovchinnikov published an article in Pravda today, commenting on the film. He wrote: Today, when Japanese militarism is being revived and aggressive forces are raising their heads again in Japan, artistic works that truthfully depict the arduous life of the Chinese people during the War of Resistance Against Japan and their heroic struggle against foreign invaders and their lackeys – the despicable Kuomintang traitorous bandits – are of particular importance. "New Heroes and Heroines" is such an artistic work.

This film is adapted from the novel "New Heroes and Heroines" by Chinese writers Yuan Jing and Kong Jue. The Russian translation of this novel has been published in its second edition, and Soviet readers are quite familiar with it. The Soviet people have always shown tireless concern and profound sympathy for the Chinese people's national liberation struggle. Now, they are appreciating with great interest this inspiring film – the latest achievement of Chinese national film art.

The author pointed out: "New Heroes and Heroines" writes about the heroic battles of the Chinese guerrillas in a small village in North China during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the great power of the Communist Party that inspired the people to rise up against the enemy. At that time, Japan launched an invasion of China, and most of the petty bourgeoisie and middle class were panicked and at a loss. The Kuomintang shamelessly betrayed national interests. Only the Chinese Communist Party proved to be the only force capable of uniting the people as a whole and mobilizing their boiling hatred of the invaders to repel the enemy.

The heroic Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, as well as the guerrillas formed by Communists behind Japanese lines, bore the most arduous tasks in the struggle against the enemy.

Ovchinnikov pointed out that adapting such a long novel into a film was a difficult task. On the whole, the director Shi Dongshan did this work very well. He skillfully selected several of the most important scenes, maintaining the unity and coherence of the theme.

While narrating the content of the film, the author said: No matter how small the achievements of the guerrillas in this village in fighting the Japanese army, these achievements are part of the great people's victory that was about to come at that time. This idea, which runs through the entire film, gives the film a positive and optimistic tone.

"We want to answer all the enemies, now and in the future: the Chinese people can never be defeated!" These words, spoken by the Communist Hei Laocai at the end of the film, are a serious warning to those who want to plunge China's cities and villages into the flames of war again.

### 奥夫钦尼科夫在苏联真理报上撰文  评我国影片“新儿女英雄传”

    奥夫钦尼科夫在苏联真理报上撰文
    评我国影片“新儿女英雄传”
    塔斯社莫斯科十日电：中国新影片“新儿女英雄传”正在苏联各电影院放映，映出十分成功。奥夫钦尼科夫今日在真理报上发表文章，评论这部影片，他写道：今天，当着日本军国主义正在复活，侵略势力在日本重新抬头的时候，真实地描写中国人民在抗日战争时期中的艰苦生活和他们反抗外国侵略者及其走狗——可耻的国民党卖国匪帮——的英勇斗争的艺术作品就具有特别重要的意义。“新儿女英雄传”正是这样的一部艺术作品。
    这部影片是根据中国作家袁静和孔厥所写的小说“新儿女英雄传”改编的。这部小说的俄文译本已发行了第二版，苏联读者对于它是颇为熟悉的。苏联人民对于中国人民的民族解放斗争一向是寄以不倦的关切和深刻的同情的。现在，他们正以极大的关心来欣赏这部令人鼓舞的影片——中国民族电影艺术的最新成就。
    作者指出：“新儿女英雄传”写的是抗日战争时期华北某一个小村庄的中国游击队的英雄战绩以及鼓舞人民奋起抗敌的伟大力量共产党的情形。在当时，日本对中国发动了侵略，大多数小资产阶级和中产阶级感到惊慌失措、无所适从，而国民党则卑鄙地出卖民族利益，只有中国共产党被证明是能够把人民团结成为一个整体并把他们对于侵略者的沸腾的仇恨心动员起来击退敌人的唯一力量。
    英雄的八路军和新四军以及共产党员在日军后方所组成的游击队在抗敌斗争中担负了最艰巨的任务。
    奥夫钦尼科夫指出，把这么长的一部小说改编为电影，是一个困难的工作，整个说来，这部影片的编导史东山把这个工作做得很好。他巧妙地选择了其中几个最重要的场面，保持了主题的统一和首尾贯串。
    作者在叙述影片内容时说：不管这个村庄的游击队和日军作战时获得的成就是多么微小，但是这些成就是走向当时即将到来的伟大的人民胜利的组成部分。贯串着整部影片的这种思想，使得影片具有积极的、乐观的情调。
    “我们要回答现在和将来所有的敌人：中国人民是永远打不倒的！”这是共产党员黑老蔡在影片结束时所说的话，这些话对于那些想把中国的城市村庄再度卷入战火中去的人们来说，是一个严重的警告。
