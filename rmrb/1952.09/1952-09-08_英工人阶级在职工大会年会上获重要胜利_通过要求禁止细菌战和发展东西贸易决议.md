Xinhua News Agency, September 6th, Malgate: The 84th Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress opened in Malgate on September 1st. Attending the meeting were 938 representatives from 183 unions affiliated with the Trades Union Congress, representing 8,020,000 members. The meeting's proceedings indicate that the struggle between the broad masses of British workers and the right-wing union leaders who control the Trades Union Congress has become increasingly fierce.

This year's annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress took place against the backdrop of a continuously deteriorating British economic crisis and an unprecedented surge in the wave of British workers opposing the arms race policy. Since April of this year, major British trade unions, regional trade union organizations, and a significant portion of local Labour Party organizations have held meetings, passing numerous militant resolutions demanding that the British government immediately cease following the United States, halt the implementation of war policies, and instead pursue a policy of peace. These resolutions reflected the wishes of the broad masses of British workers.

At this year's annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress, despite the intensified efforts of the right-wing union bosses to suppress the resistance of the lower-level masses, the British working class's struggle against the war policy still achieved a significant victory. During the meeting on the 2nd, the delegates defeated various conspiracies orchestrated by the Chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, Deakin, General Secretary Tawson, and others, and passed the motion proposed by the Association of Scientific Workers demanding the prohibition of germ warfare with a majority of 269,000 votes. In addition, at the meetings on the 2nd and 3rd, the congress also passed several motions, such as protesting against the racial oppression of the South African Federal Government, demanding that the British government assist the British film industry to resist the pressure of American films, and demanding increased workers' welfare.

During the congress's proceedings, the British working class displayed a tenacious fighting spirit, repeatedly dealing significant blows to the right-wing union bosses. On the first day of the meeting, Chairman Deakin was met with sharp rebuttals during his opening speech. In his speech defending the arms race policy, he deliberately posed the rhetorical question: Will Britain's arms expansion plan and the Western bloc's widespread arms expansion movement only bring war and not peace? The hall immediately erupted with cries of "Yes!" During the morning meeting on the 2nd, representatives from many unions, such as the Tobacco Workers' Union and the National Union of Motor Vehicle Builders, actively supported the motions put forward separately by the Building and Allied Trades Operatives' Union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union. These two motions condemned the arms expansion movement for causing financial and economic difficulties in Britain and called for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, the prevention of the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, and the granting of freedom to the oppressed people. The representatives emphasized that the main threat to world peace came from the American ruling clique; while the Soviet Union was busy with peaceful construction, and the purpose of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy was to increase the people's welfare. Stott, General Secretary of the Building and Allied Trades Operatives' Union, said that almost 50 percent of Britain's national income was used for war expenses, which fatally affected the British economy, causing unemployment and various difficulties. Horner, General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, pointed out that the release of Nazi war criminal Krupp and the return of a large amount of property had exposed the lie of so-called rearming West Germany for peace. Scott, an executive member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, said that it was precisely those people for whom Eisenhower spoke who were preparing for war and forcing Britain to accept a huge arms expansion plan. Hart, a representative of the Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders' Union, pointed out that the devastation and destruction caused in Korea and Malaya aroused people's hatred of the imperialists.

The right-wing leaders of the Trades Union Congress were very afraid of the strong resistance of the lower-level masses, so they racked their brains and used all kinds of despicable means to control the proceedings of the meeting. Ignoring the protests of the delegates attending the meeting, they forced the congress to accept regulations that hindered free and comprehensive discussion of various motions: members of the supreme committee of the Trades Union Congress's right-wing leadership body could speak for 30 minutes at the meeting, while trade union representatives, including the movers of the motions, could only speak for 10 minutes. This gave the right-wing union bosses ample time to engage in deception and slander at the meeting, while the representatives who expressed the demands and wishes of the vast number of trade union members often could not finish their speeches. They implemented a so-called proxy voting system, using the proxy rights of large unions controlled by right-wing elements to manipulate the congress's votes. In addition, they also exerted pressure on the trade union representatives inside and outside the meeting. In this way, at the meeting on the 2nd, they finally managed to defeat the motion opposing arms expansion and war preparations, which represented the peace aspirations of the British working people. They also forced the congress to approve the supreme committee's unreasonable decision to expel the London Trades Council, which represented more than 600,000 workers in London. This Trades Council had angered the right-wing union leaders in Britain because it actively safeguarded the interests of its trade union members and repeatedly embodied the unity of Communist Party members, Labour Party members, and trade union members.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Malgate: The 84th Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress concluded on the 5th after five days of meetings.

At the meeting on the 5th, the delegates unanimously demanded the development of trade between the East and the West. Gardner, General Secretary of the Foundry Workers' Union, pointed out in his speech that the Battle Act was the main factor restricting British trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Trade between the East and the West could provide the basis for prosperity and peace. Gardner's words were met with applause. The congress then unanimously passed a resolution. The resolution pointed out that in the current increasingly competitive world market, Britain's foreign trade was encountering many difficulties. This was promoting the deterioration of the British economic situation and creating the danger of an endless recession and unemployment. The resolution emphasized that, in particular, the widespread development of trade with China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries would greatly contribute to the improvement of the current international situation. Therefore, the congress called on governments of all countries to take immediate joint action to discuss the possibility of developing trade and abolishing artificial barriers.

The congress's unanimous demand for the development of East-West trade greatly embarrassed the American bourgeoisie. United Press International lamented: "This is the most astonishing news from the Trades Union Congress," and "few people had expected it beforehand."

At the meetings on the 4th and 5th, the British working class continued to carry forward its tenacious fighting spirit and engaged in fierce struggles with the right-wing union bosses. Representatives raised many motions on wage issues, criticized the government's economic policies, expressed anxiety about rising prices, and demanded that the Trades Union Congress's supreme committee abandon its so-called "moderate" policy on wage issues. They pointed out that the "moderate" policy was actually a policy of freezing wages and lowering the living standards of workers. In addition, the Bank Employees' Union proposed to reform the supreme committee, which they described as an undemocratic body. Kleber, a representative of the Bank Employees' Union, pointed out that the Trades Union Congress was currently controlled by four or five large unions. Anyone who did not please the heads of these large unions could never be elected to the supreme committee. This oppressed smaller unions.

The right-wing union bosses used their usual despicable tactics to deal with the demands of the broad masses of workers regarding wages and the reform of the undemocratic leadership structure of the Trades Union Congress. In order to avoid sharp criticism and possible defeat, they put pressure on the congress, saying that the demands for wage increases were "excessive demands," and finally forced the congress to reject the motion demanding the abandonment of the so-called "moderate" policy. Similarly, they also forced the congress to reject the motion regarding the reform of the undemocratic leadership structure, and enabled the election of a reactionary supreme committee headed by O'Brien, the secretary of the Film Artistes' Association.

    英工人阶级在职工大会年会上获重要胜利
    通过要求禁止细菌战和发展东西贸易决议
    【新华社六日讯】马尔加特消息：英国职工大会第八十四届年会已于九月一日在马尔加特开幕。出席会议的，有隶属于职工大会的一百八十三个工会八百零二万会员的代表九百三十八人。会议情况表明：英国广大的工人群众和控制着职工大会的右翼的工会领导分子之间的斗争，已经越来越激烈。
    本届英国职工大会年会，是在英国经济危机不断恶化、英国工人群众反对备战政策的浪潮空前高涨的情况下举行的。今年四月以来，英国各大工会、各地区工会组织和很大一部分工党地方组织曾先后举行会议，通过了许多战斗性的决议，要求英国政府立即停止追随美国，停止执行战争政策，而实行和平政策。这些决议案体现了广大的英国工人群众的愿望。
    在本届职工大会年会上，尽管右翼的工会头子们变本加厉地压制下层群众的反抗，但是英国工人阶级反对战争政策的斗争仍然获得了重大的胜利。在二日会议上，出席大会的代表们击败了英国职工大会主席狄金、总书记陶逊等所玩弄的各种阴谋，而以二十六万九千票的多数通过了科学工作者协会要求禁止细菌战的提案。此外，在二日和三日会议上，大会还通过了若干提案，如抗议南非联邦政府的种族压迫，要求英国政府援助英国电影业以抵抗美国影片的压力，并且要求增进工人福利。
    在大会会议进程中，英国工人阶级发挥了顽强的战斗精神，一再给右翼工会头子们以重大打击。会议第一天，大会主席狄金就在致开幕词时遭到了针锋相对的回击。他在辩护扩军备战政策的演说中故意提出反问：英国的扩军计划和西方集团普遍进行的扩军运动是不是只会带来战争而不会带来和平？会场上马上响起一片呼声：“是的！”在二日上午会议上，烟草工人工会、全国汽车工人工会等许多工会的代表，都积极支持分别由建筑与装配工人工会以及混合机器工会提出的提案，这两个提案痛斥扩军运动引起英国的财政经济困难，并且号召缔结五大国和平公约，制止西德和日本重新武装，给被压迫的人民以自由。代表们强调指出：对世界和平的主要威胁是来自美国统治集团方面的；而苏联则忙于和平建设，苏联第五个发展国民经济五年计划的目的是增加人民福利。建筑与装配工人工会总书记斯图纳里说：英国国民收入差不多有百分之五十用作战争费用，这就致命地影响了英国经济，造成失业和种种困难。救火员工会总书记荷耳纳指出：释放纳粹战犯克虏伯并发还大宗财产这件事，已经拆穿了所谓为和平而重新武装西德的谎话。混合机器工会执行委员斯可特说：准备战争并且强迫英国接受庞大的扩军计划的，正是艾森豪威尔代表他们发言的那些人。锅炉制造工人与钢铁造船工人联合会代表哈特指出：在朝鲜和马来亚造成的荒芜和破坏，引起人们对帝国主义者的憎恨。
    职工大会的右翼领导分子十分害怕下层群众的强烈反抗，因此费尽心思使用种种卑鄙手段，来控制会议的进行。他们不顾出席大会的代表们的抗议，强迫大会接受妨碍自由地全面讨论各项提案的规定：职工大会右翼领导机构最高委员会的委员们可以在会上发言三十分钟，各工会代表，包括提案人在内，却只能发言十分钟。这就使得右翼工会头子有充分时间在会上来进行欺骗和诬蔑，而表达广大工会会员的要求和愿望的代表们则往往结束不了发言，他们实行所谓委托投票制，利用右翼分子控制的大工会的委托权来操纵大会的表决。此外，他们还在会内会外对各工会代表施行压力。这样，在二日会议上，他们终于使得代表着英国千千万万劳动人民的和平愿望的反对扩军备战的提案遭到否决。他们并且强迫大会批准了最高委员会无理开除代表伦敦六十万以上工人的伦敦工会理事会的决定，这个工会理事会因为积极维护工会会员的利益并且多次体现了共产党员、工党党员和工会会员的团结，而触怒了英国的右翼工会领导分子。
    【新华社七日讯】马尔加特消息：英国职工大会第八十四届年会经过五天会议之后，已经在五日闭幕。
    在五日会议上，出席大会的代表们一致要求发展东、西方之间的贸易。翻砂工人联合会总书记加德纳在发言中指出：巴特尔法案是限制英国和苏联及人民民主国家贸易的主要因素。东、西方之间的贸易能够提供繁荣与和平的基础。加德纳的话赢得了一片掌声。随后大会一致通过决议。决议指出：在目前世界市场上竞争越来越激烈的情况下，英国对外贸易碰到了许多困难。这就促进了英国经济情况的恶化，并且有造成漫无止境的不景气现象和失业的危险。决议强调说：特别是广泛发展对中国、苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，会大大有助于目前国际局势的改善。因此，大会要求各国政府，立即采取共同行动，讨论发展贸易和废除人为的障碍之可能性。
    大会一致要求发展东西方贸易这件事，使得美国资产阶级非常狼狈。合众社懊丧地说：“这是职工大会最惊人的消息”，“事先很少人想得到”。
    在四日和五日会议上，英国工人阶级继续发扬顽强的战斗精神，和右翼工会头子展开了剧烈的斗争。代表们针对工资问题提出了许多议案，批评政府的经济政策，对物价高涨表示焦虑，要求职工大会最高委员会放弃关于工资问题的所谓“温和”政策。他们指出：“温和”政策实际上就是冻结工资、降低工人生活水平的政策。此外，银行职工工会又提议改革最高委员会这种不民主的机构。银行职工工会代表克乐伯指出：目前职工大会实际上是由四、五个大工会控制着的。谁要是不惬这几个大工会的头子的意，谁就绝不能当选最高委员会委员。这就使较小的工会受到压迫。
    右翼工会头子使用一贯的卑鄙手法，来对付广大工人群众关于工资和改革不民主的职工大会领导机构的要求。为了逃避尖锐的批评和可能遭到的失败，他们就对大会施行压力，说什么提高工资的要求是“过分的要求”，终于迫使大会否决了要求放弃所谓“温和”政策的提案。同样，他们也强迫大会否决了关于改革不民主的领导机构的提案，而使大会选出了以电影戏剧工作者工会书记欧布里安为首的反动的最高委员会。
