    Celebrating the Opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway and Striving to Continue the Northwest Railway Construction Task
    Wang Shitai, Director of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau
    The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is open to traffic! The people of the whole country are happy, and the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest are even happier! The people of the Northwest have been looking forward to this for many years, and today, this hope has been realized. The early opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway will greatly promote industrial construction in the Northwest, promote agricultural production in the Northwest, promote material exchanges in the Northwest, improve the lives of people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, and accelerate the economic construction in the entire Northwest.
    The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is 347 kilometers long, and the terrain along the line is dangerous, the geology is complex, the population is sparse, and transportation is particularly difficult. The project is very arduous. It passes through the Wei River valley in the middle of the Qinling Xinglong Mountain range, crosses the Wei River several times, and west of Longxi is a continuous loess plateau and bitter water area. In this area, the railway passes through more than a dozen deep gullies. The stones, flagstones, and sand used for road construction, and even the drinking water and engineering water, had to be transported from very far away. Thousands upon thousands of workers lived in tents or in temporary dug-out cave dwellings. Supply and transportation were relatively difficult, and the lives of the employees were particularly hard. In the past two years, with the arduous efforts of military personnel, civilian workers, and all employees, more than 23 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been excavated, more than 280,000 cubic meters of concrete have been poured, tunnels of more than ten kilometers have been built, nearly a thousand large and small bridges and culverts have been constructed, and a total of 402 kilometers of railway tracks, including main and side lines, have been laid. More than 100,000 square meters of new houses have been built. Looking at it today, this achievement is very significant.
    The opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway once again demonstrates the superiority of the new China's people's democratic state system. Building railways in the new China is the people's own business, and it is the business of the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government have clearly prescribed correct guidelines and policies for us, and leaders at all levels have given us specific instructions and assistance. First and foremost, our Chinese People's Liberation Army should be mentioned. They are a great and strong combat team and a construction team. Immediately after completing the great battle mission of liberating the entire Northwest, they immediately turned to the production front. In the spring of 1950, 70,000 troops first served as pioneers, undertaking the glorious task of road construction, which was a great encouragement to the people of the Northwest. The broad masses of the people enthusiastically participated in railway construction work, mobilizing more than 20,000 civilian workers before and after, and also personally led by local party and government cadres, creating a brilliant record of civilian workers building roads. More than 400 civilian worker cadres, after completing their tasks, were determined to work in the railway department forever. Although the country's economy was still very difficult during the tense period of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Central People's Government still tried its best to ensure the supply of all money and materials according to the plan. The people of the whole country have given us a lot of help and encouragement in terms of both materials and spirit. This shows that without the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and without the support and encouragement of the people of the whole country, it would be impossible to complete the task so quickly.
    Tens of thousands of workers are the main force of construction, but after liberation, some of them were still oppressed and exploited by feudal contractors, hindering their enthusiasm and talent for construction. Therefore, we first mobilized the broad masses of employees, overthrew the feudal contractor system, and formed all self-managed engineering teams with the original state-owned construction teams as the backbone. The workers became the true masters of the people's railway, and they participated in the construction with the attitude of masters. In the political movements such as the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the land reform, and this year's "Three-Anti" campaign, the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees have been greatly improved, demonstrating infinite wisdom and infinite power. They launched patriotic production competitions and the movement to increase production and practice economy. New achievements have continuously emerged on the production front, the production potential has been brought into play, and production efficiency has been improved. The earth and stone excavation work rate has generally increased by about 40%; the concrete engineering of bridges and culverts has increased by 70%. The First Engineering Team directly under the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau invented the "two-layer, three-section" operation method in excavating hard soil tunnel pilot holes, making the progress of pilot hole excavation reach a maximum of 11.2 meters per day, creating a record of an average of 6.85 meters per day. The workers of the Twelve Joint Operation Engineering Team invented the stepped two-layer operation method and the trench excavation method in excavating ordinary soil tunnel pilot holes, making the work efficiency reach a maximum record of 24 meters per day. The efficiency of mechanical work has been continuously improved. Taking the efficiency of bulldozers as an example, if 1950 is taken as 100, it increased to 133 in 1951 and 156 in 1952. The work rate of other machines has generally increased by about 50%. The increase in engineering transportation volume has ensured the supply of a large amount of materials. If the transportation volume in 1950 is taken as 100, it increased to 203.6 in 1951 and 543.5 in 1952. Technical personnel are also another main force in construction, but because they have been under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang for a long time, various old ideas hinder their progress, making their wisdom and ability unable to be fully utilized. Therefore, we have also focused on carrying out ideological reform of these technical personnel and intellectuals, strengthening their position and viewpoint of serving the people, and cultivating their ideological style of connecting with reality and connecting with the masses. In order to help them progress, we not only enlighten and educate them politically and ideologically, but also require them to go deep into the masses and deep into the construction sites in their actual work, and educate them with many specific examples, so that they can personally experience the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and experience the great power of the working class. In this ideological education that combines theory and practice, they have gradually realized that they are members of the working class, and they have participated in the construction of the people's railway with the attitude of masters. The vast majority of technical personnel and workers closely cooperate and move forward hand in hand; in this way, their work enthusiasm, sense of responsibility, and their wisdom and talents have been greatly brought into play. For example, the survey and design team adopted a cautious attitude towards route selection, paid attention to construction experience and geological conditions when designing, and many engineering personnel could also often go deep into the construction site and approach the workers. They have begun to appreciate the benefits of relying on workers and democratic management. Xie Chongwu, a construction worker, said: "Teaching technology to the workers, and the workers also teach themselves tricks, so that technology has brilliance, and technology can better serve the people." Engineer Zhu Yongkang had never repaired oxygen trucks, but he and the technical workers studied the principle of oxygen trucks together and repaired them at the same time, thus repairing a broken oxygen truck worth 1.5 billion yuan. Another example is the feat of erecting four 24-meter steel beams of the Qingshui River Bridge in seven hours, which are all examples of the combination of technology and the masses of workers. The five engineering teams and more than 30 joint operation teams directly under the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau are the basic forces of construction and the melting pot of the combination of technical personnel and workers. In this production army, we have cultivated many activists who have become the leading backbone in production; we have promoted hundreds of workers and technical personnel cadres to take on leadership positions at all levels. This is a new force, and their future is limitless.
    Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is an indispensable condition for various constructions in the new China. The relatively smooth and early completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is inseparable from the help of Soviet experts and the learning of advanced Soviet experience. Our learning of advanced Soviet experience is not only to learn the advanced technology and advanced operation methods of the Soviet Union, but also to learn their advanced management methods and organizational leadership methods. Under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience and with the help of Soviet experts, we have effectively grasped the planning work; in order to adapt to the nature of self-managed projects, we have adjusted the organizational structure, established new systems, established joint operation teams, and promoted flow operation methods and soil filling and ramming experience, which have all played a great role in the work and shortened our exploration process. For example, after the establishment of the cement finished product factory, a large number of reinforced concrete beams and cement water pipes were manufactured centrally and then transported to the construction site for installation, which greatly reduced costs and accelerated the progress of the project. Although the time for establishing joint operation engineering teams and promoting flow operation methods is very short, it has shown its superiority. Not only is it easy for workers to master technology and improve their proficiency, but it also implements the responsibility system, increasing the natural restraint between members, helping each other, and supervising each other, improving quality, and at the same time bringing into play the potential of productive labor.
    In adapting to the climate season, adapting to the terrain, and saving conditions, the use of pre-opened engineering trains to replace automobiles and large vehicles for transportation not only solved the supply of a large number of engineering materials and the difficulty of using water and materials in the bitter water area, but also adapted to the productivity of the engineering teams and encouraged production enthusiasm. This has played a direct role in shortening the construction period and reducing costs. According to statistics from January to August this year, excluding steel rails, sleepers, ballast, etc., which should not be included, the materials transported by train instead of automobiles and large vehicles have reached more than 26 million ton-kilometers. It is estimated that it will reach 30 million ton-kilometers by the end of October. In this way, with the train already solving the transportation of a large amount of materials, an average of only 30 trucks per day is needed for auxiliary transportation. Otherwise, an average of more than 2,000 or more trucks per day would be needed for transportation. This number is very large, and even if there are enough trucks, it is very difficult to get so many trucks to the places needed for the project.
    The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway can be completed relatively smoothly and ahead of schedule is the result of the combination of politics and technology, the combination of workers and technical personnel, the combination of leadership and the masses, and the combination of advanced Soviet experience and the actual conditions at the time and place. Obviously, without the correct leadership of the working class ideology, without the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, and without the combination of the broad masses of workers and technical personnel, the fact of such rapid opening to traffic in Lanzhou would not have occurred.
    However, on the other hand, there are still shortcomings. Although the quality of the project has made great progress compared with the past, there are still individual projects whose quality has not met the standard requirements, some survey and design work cannot keep up with the construction requirements, the organization, leadership, and management work of the construction cannot fully meet the requirements of the site, the efficiency of the machinery has not been fully brought into play, and safety and sanitation work still needs to be greatly improved.
    The experiences and lessons of more than two years are many and the content is very rich. Although the experience is not yet mature, the lessons are indeed very profound. Only through a comprehensive and systematic inspection and summary of the work can we truly understand these experiences and lessons, and only then can we improve a step on the existing basis. This is the task that urgently needs to be solved after the opening of traffic in Lanzhou. The task of 1952 was completed relatively smoothly with the support of all employees and the people of the whole country. In order to welcome the upcoming upsurge of national economic construction, we will shoulder more arduous and glorious tasks in the future. There are still many obstacles on our road ahead, and we must overcome them with great efforts. We must not only fight against towering mountains, rugged canyons, and slurry areas, but also fight against the special climate of the Northwest, and the vast deserts and Gobi beaches. The country requires us not only to build quickly, but also to build well and save money. In the future, we must be more determined and more confident to overcome these natural obstacles; we must also guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to work hard, continue to improve, and strive to complete the glorious task of railway construction in the Northwest!

    庆祝天兰铁路通车，为继续完成西北铁路建设任务而努力
    西北铁路干线工程局局长　王世泰
    天兰铁路通车了！全国人民欢喜，全西北各族人民更欢喜！西北人民盼望了很多年，今天，这个希望实现了。天兰铁路提前通车，就会大大推动西北的工业建设，推动西北的农业生产，推动西北的物资交流，改善西北各族人民的生活，使整个西北经济建设事业，更快地向前发展。
    天兰铁路全长三百四十七公里，沿线地形险要，地质复杂，人烟稀少，交通特别困难。工程非常艰巨，它穿过秦岭兴龙山山脉中间的渭河河谷，几次跨过渭河，陇西以西，又是连绵不断的黄土高原和苦水地区；在这个地区内，铁路经过十几条深沟，修路工程用的石子、片石、沙子，甚至吃的水和工程用水，都要从很远的地方运去。工地里成千成万的工人，住在帐篷里，或者住在临时挖的土窑洞里，供应运输较为困难，职工生活特别艰苦。两年来，在军工、民工和全体职工艰苦努力之下，已开挖了土石方两千三百多万立方公尺，灌注了混凝土二十八万多立方公尺，修筑了十公里以上的隧道，大小桥梁涵洞近一千多座，铺轨正线连侧线共有四百零二公里长，新建房屋十多万平方公尺。今天看来，这个成绩是很大的。
    天兰铁路的通车，又一次说明新中国人民民主国家制度的优越性。新中国修铁路是人民自己的事，是全国人民的事。毛主席和中央人民政府明确地给我们规定了正确的方针和政策，各级领导又给了我们具体的指示和帮助。首先应该提出的，是我们的中国人民解放军，他们是伟大坚强的战斗队，又是建设队，他们在全部解放西北、刚刚结束伟大的战斗任务之后，立即转到生产战线上来。一九五零年春，七万军队首先充当开路先锋，担负了修路的光荣任务，这对西北人民是很大的鼓舞。广大人民踊跃地参加铁路建设工作，前后共动员了两万多民工，还由地方党政干部亲自领导，创造了民工修路的光辉纪录。四百多民工干部在完成任务以后，都决心永远在铁路部门工作。虽然在紧张的抗美援朝战争时期，国家经济还在很困难的情况下，但是中央人民政府还是想尽一切办法，始终按照计划保证了一切钱财物资的供应。全国人民无论在资材上精神上都给了我们很多的帮助和鼓励，这就说明，离开了共产党和人民政府的正确领导，和全国人民的支援鼓舞，要想这样迅速地完成任务，是不可能的。
    数万工人是建设的主力军，但是在解放以后，他们仍然有一部分受着封建包商的压迫和剥削，阻碍着他们建设的热情和才能。所以，我们首先发动广大职工，推翻了封建包商制度，以原有国营施工队为骨干，全部组成了自办工程队。工人们就变成了人民铁路的真正主人，他们用主人翁的姿态参加了建设。在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革和今年的“三反”等政治运动中，广大职工的政治觉悟和生产情绪大大提高了，表现了无限的智慧和无限的力量，展开了爱国主义的生产竞赛和增产节约运动，在生产战线上不断出现了新的成绩，生产潜在力得到发挥，生产效率得到提高。土石方工率一般提高百分之四十左右；桥梁涵洞混凝土工程提高百分之七十。西北铁路干线工程局直辖的第一工程队在开挖硬土隧道导坑中，发明了“两层三节”操作法，使挖导坑的进度最高达到一天前进十一点二公尺，创造了平均每天前进六点八五公尺的纪录；十二联合作业工程队工人，在开挖普通土质隧道导坑中，发明阶梯式两层作业法、起槽开挖法，使工作效率达到每天前进二十四公尺的最高纪录；机械工作效率，不断提高，就拿推土机工作效率来说，假如以一九五零年为一百的话，一九五一年就提高到一百三十三，一九五二年就提高到一百五十六，其他机械工率都普遍提高百分之五十上下。工程运输量的提高，保证了大量的材料供应，假如以一九五零年的运输量为一百的话，一九五一年就提高到二百零三点六，一九五二年就提高到五百四十三点五。技术人员也是建设中的另外一支主力军，但是由于他们长期处在国民党反动统治下，各种旧的思想阻碍着他们的进步，使他们的智慧和能力不能充分地发挥。因而我们又注重进行了对这些技术人员和知识分子的思想改造，加强了他们为人民服务的立场、观点，培养了他们联系实际联系群众的思想作风。为了帮助他们进步，我们不只从政治思想上对他们进行启发教育，而且在实际工作中要求他们深入群众、深入工地，用许多具体的事例教育他们，使他们亲身体验到共产党和人民政府领导的正确，体验到工人阶级的伟大力量。在这种理论和实际结合的思想教育当中，他们也就逐渐认识到自己是工人阶级队伍中的一员，他们以主人翁的姿态参加了人民铁路建设，绝大多数的技术人员和工人紧密合作，携手前进；这样，他们的工作热情、负责精神和他们的智慧才能就得到了巨大的发挥。如勘测设计队对选线采取了审慎态度，设计时重视施工的经验和地质的情况，很多工程人员也能经常深入工地，接近工人。他们已开始体会到依靠工人和民主管理的好处，工务员谢崇武说：“把技术教给工人，工人也教给自己窍门，这样技术就有了光芒，技术也就能更好地为人民服务。”工程师朱永康从来没有修过氧气车，但他和技术工人在一起，一边研究氧气车的原理，一边修理，就这样把一架价值十五亿元的破氧气车修好了。再如清水河桥七小时架设四孔二十四公尺钢梁的事迹，都是技术与工人群众结合的范例。西北铁路干线工程局直辖的五个工程队和三十多个联合作业队是施工的基本力量，是技术人员和工人结合的熔炉。在这支生产大军中，我们已培养了很多的积极分子，成为生产中的领导骨干；提拔了几百名工人和技术人员干部，担任了各级领导工作，这是一支新生的力量，他们的前途是不可限量的。
    学习苏联先进经验，是新中国各项建设不可少的条件。天兰铁路能够比较顺利地提前完成，是和苏联专家的帮助及学习苏联先进经验分不开的。我们对苏联先进经验的学习，不仅是学习苏联的先进技术和先进操作方法，而且要学习他们的先进的经营管理方法和组织领导方法。我们在苏联先进经验的指导和苏联专家的帮助下，切实掌握了计划工作；为适应自办工程的性质调整了组织机构、建立新制度、建立联合作业队，推行流水作业法和填土打夯经验等几方面，都对工作起了很大的作用，缩短了我们摸索的过程。如洋灰成品厂建立后，大量的钢筋混凝土梁和洋灰水管集中起来制造，然后运到工地安装，就大大地降低了成本，加速了工程进展。建立联合作业工程队和推行流水作业法的时间虽然很短，但已显示了它的优越性，不但工人容易掌握技术，容易提高熟练程度，而且贯彻了负责制，使成员与成员之间增加自然的制约力，互相帮助，又互助监督，提高了质量，同时发挥了生产劳动的潜在力。
    在适应气候季节，适应地形和节省的条件下，利用先通工程列车，以火车代替汽车、大车运输的办法，不仅解决了大量工程材料的供应和苦水区用水用料的困难，而且适应了工程队的生产力，鼓励了生产情绪。这对于缩短工期，降低成本，都起了直接的作用。据今年一月到八月的统计，除不应计算在内的钢轨、枕木、道碴等等以外，火车代替汽车、大车运输的材料，已有两千六百多万吨公里。到十月底估计将达到三千万吨公里，这样，在火车已解决了大量材料运输的情况下，平均每天只须要三十辆汽车辅助运输就够了。不然，就需要每天平均两千辆以上或是更多的汽车运输，这个数目字是很大的，就是有足够的汽车，怎样把那么多的汽车开到工程需要的地方去，也是很困难的问题。
    天兰铁路能够比较顺利地提前通车，就是政治与技术相结合，工人与技术人员相结合，领导与群众相结合，苏联先进经验与当时当地实际情况相结合的结果。很明显地，没有工人阶级思想的正确领导，没有苏联先进经验的指导，没有广大的工人群众和技术人员的结合，就不会出现这样快的通车兰州的事实。
    但是，在另一方面，还是有缺点的。工程质量虽然比过去有了很大的进步，但是还有个别工程质量没有达到标准要求，有些勘测设计工作赶不上施工要求，施工的组织领导管理工作还不能完全满足现场的要求，机械效能没有充分发挥出来，安全卫生工作还须要大力改进。
    两年多的经验教训是很多的，内容也是很丰富的，虽然经验还不成熟，而教训确是非常深刻，只有经过全面地系统地检查和总结工作，才能真正领会这些经验教训，才能在现有基础上提高一步，这是通车兰州后，急待我们解决的任务。一九五二年的任务，在全体职工和全国人民支援之下，是比较顺利地完成了。为迎接即将到来的国家经济建设高潮，今后我们将要担负更艰巨更光荣的任务。在我们前进的道路上，还有很多障碍，我们要用大力去克服。我们不仅要和崇山峻岭、崎岖的峡谷、翻浆地带作斗争，而且要和西北特殊的气候，和广大的沙漠、戈壁滩作斗争。国家要求我们的不只是要修得快，而且要修得好，修得省。今后我们要更有决心、更有信心地去克服这些自然的障碍；我们还要戒骄戒躁，继续努力，继续提高，为完成西北铁路建设的光荣任务而奋斗！（新华社）（附图片）
