　　International Brief Review
　　Japanese People Oppose the United States Stepping Up its Military Occupation of Japan
　　According to the provisions of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, July 26th was the deadline for the withdrawal of the so-called Allied occupation forces stationed in Japan. However, the American occupation forces are now continuing to be stationed in Japan under the new guise of "security forces," and on July 26th itself, the United States signed the so-called agreement on providing military bases with the Japanese Yoshida government. According to this agreement, Japan is to provide the American occupation forces with as many as 603 barracks, army, navy, and air force training grounds, and naval bases. In a country like Japan, with an area of only 360,000 square kilometers, to be filled with so many foreign occupation forces' bases and facilities, what "independence" does Japan have to speak of? The facts prove that the separate peace treaty with Japan, concocted by the United States single-handedly, has not only failed to end the American military occupation of Japan, but has made the American military occupation of Japan "legal" and indefinite.
　　The American occupiers deceive the Japanese people by saying that the American troops are stationed in Japan to "protect Japan's security." But in fact, it is the American aggressors who are making Japan unsafe and infringing upon Japan's territorial sovereignty. The United States has turned Japan into its military colony, and then turned Japan into the center of its aggressive activities in the Far East. The American military occupation of Japan has plunged the Japanese people into an abyss of suffering.
　　The occupation system and war policy that the United States is pursuing in Japan are being implemented through the Yoshida reactionary government. The military base agreement signed on July 26th is another piece of evidence of the Yoshida government's traitorous policy. The increasingly blatant traitorous behavior of the Yoshida reactionary government has aroused widespread opposition from the Japanese people, making its ruling foundation increasingly fragile and isolated. Since the separate peace treaty "came into effect" in April this year, the broad masses of the Japanese people and various opposition parties have resolutely advocated dissolving the Diet and holding early general elections. The call issued by the Japanese Communist Party to overthrow the Yoshida government and establish a national liberation united government is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people and is gaining the support of an increasing number of people. The Yoshida government originally planned to delay the election date as much as possible, but under the strong pressure of the people and the intensified development of infighting within the Japanese reactionaries, Yoshida was forced to announce the dissolution of the House of Representatives on August 28 and scheduled the general election for October 1. Because the Japanese people have a firm will to strive for independence, peace, and democracy, and because the Yoshida government's traitorous behavior has been fully exposed to the Japanese people, the American aggressors cannot help but sweat over the prospects of the Japanese general election. It can be seen that the American aggressors are also feeling guilty about the occupation system they are implementing in Japan and their criminal acts of infringing upon Japan's sovereignty and independence; this further proves that the Japanese people's strength in striving for independence, peace, and democracy has undergone significant development.

    日本人民反对美国加紧对日本的军事占领
    根据旧金山和约的规定，七月二十六日是所谓各国驻日占领军撤离日本的最后期限。然而现在美国占领军仍以“安全部队”的新招牌继续驻在日本，而且就在七月二十六日那一天，美国又与日本吉田政府签订了所谓提供军事基地的协定。根据这个协定，日本要向美国占领军提供营房、陆海空军演习场、海军基地等共达六百零三处之多。在日本那样一个面积仅三十六万余方公里的国家，竟充斥着这样多的外国占领军的基地和设施，日本还有什么“独立”可言呢？事实证明美国所一手制造的单独对日和约不但没有结束美国对日本的军事占领，而是使美国对日本的军事占领变成“合法”的和无限期的了。
    美国占领者欺骗日本人民说，美军驻在日本是为了“保护日本安全”。可是事实上使日本不安全、侵犯了日本领土主权的，正是美国侵略者。美国把日本变为它的军事殖民地，然后又把日本变为它在远东进行侵略活动的中心。美国对日本的军事占领使日本人民陷于痛苦的深渊。
    美国在日本所实行的占领制度和战争政策，是通过吉田反动政府来实现的。七月二十六日签订的军事基地协定，是吉田政府卖国政策的又一证据。吉田反动政府越来越露骨的卖国行为，已经引起日本人民的普遍反对，使它的统治基础日益脆弱和孤立。今年四月单独和约“生效”以来，日本广大人民和各在野党派便坚决主张解散国会、提前举行大选。日本共产党发出的打倒吉田政府、建立民族解放联合政府的号召，越来越深入人心，得到日益众多的人民群众的拥护。吉田政府原拟把大选日期尽量拖延，可是在人民群众的强大压力下，以及日本反动派内部倾轧的加剧发展，吉田乃被迫于八月二十八日宣布解散众议院，定十月一日举行大选。由于日本人民具有争取独立、和平与民主的坚定意志，而吉田政府的卖国行为又已在日本人民的面前暴露无遗，这使得美国侵略者对日本大选的前途，不得不捏着一把冷汗。可见美国侵略者对它自己在日本实行的占领制度、侵犯日本主权与独立的犯罪行为，也已经感到做贼心虚；这更证明日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的力量有着重大的发展。
