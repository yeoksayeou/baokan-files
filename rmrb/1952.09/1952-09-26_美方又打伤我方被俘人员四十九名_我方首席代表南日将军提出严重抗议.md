    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 25th: On September 23rd, the U.S. side once again persecuted our captured personnel in batches at the Jeju Island POW camp, injuring 49 people. Nan Ri, Chief Delegate of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side on September 25th, pointing out that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the continuous war crimes of persecuting and slaughtering our captured personnel.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 25th: The U.S. side injured 49 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers on Jeju Island again on the 23rd. The U.S. side's reason for injuring them was that they held a "demonstration," but the U.S. side dared not say why they were demonstrating.
    The reason why prisoners of war want to demonstrate is very clear: they refuse to be forcibly detained by the U.S. side. The U.S. side uses Kuomintang secret agents in its POW camps to carry out barbaric persecution against the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, such as forcing them to write blood letters and forcibly tattooing their bodies, and then insists that 68 percent of them "refuse repatriation," attempting to detain this large group of prisoners of war. The U.S. side's shameless purpose of detaining our captured personnel has been blatantly revealed by the U.S. House of Representatives Military Subcommittee recently. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 21st, this committee has reached a "unanimous agreement" that "the U.S. military in Korea 'eventually' should be replaced by the Chinese Nationalist and South Korean armies." The U.S. side is now obviously dreaming of this day, so as to transfer the detained captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Kuomintang bandit army and force them to serve as cannon fodder for the war of aggression. A series of news recently revealed from Jeju Island shows that the U.S. side is intensifying its persecution of prisoners of war for this purpose, while our captured personnel are waging a resolute struggle for the sacred right to be repatriated to their motherland, a right that cannot be deprived.

    美方又打伤我方被俘人员四十九名
    我方首席代表南日将军提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城二十五日电】九月二十三日，美方在济州岛战俘营又一次成批迫害我方被俘人员，打伤四十九人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在九月二十五日向美方提出严重抗议，指出美方必须对连续不断发生的迫害和屠杀我方被俘人员的战争罪行负完全的责任。
    【新华社开城二十五日电】美方二十三日又在济州岛上打伤中国人民志愿军被俘人员四十九人。美方打伤他们的理由是他们举行“示威”，但美方怎么也不敢说出他们究竟为什么要示威。
    战俘要示威，原因是很明显的，这就是他们拒绝被美方强迫扣留。美方在其战俘营中利用国民党特务，对中国人民志愿军被俘人员实行了强迫写血书、强迫在身上刺字等等野蛮迫害，然后硬说他们之中有百分之六十八的人“拒绝遣返”，企图把这一大批战俘扣留下来，美方扣留我方被俘人员的无耻目的，已经由美国众议院军事小组委员会最近明目张胆地透露出来了。据路透社华盛顿二十一日电报道，这个委员会已经取得“一致意见”，认为“朝鲜境内美军‘终究’应由中国国民党与南朝鲜军队所代替”。美方现在显然正在梦想这一天到来，以便把扣留下来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员移交给国民党匪军，强迫他们充当侵略战争的炮灰。最近济州岛上透露出来的一连串消息，说明美方正在为此目的而加紧迫害战俘，而我方被俘人员则正在为不可剥夺的遣返祖国的神圣权利而进行坚决的斗争。
