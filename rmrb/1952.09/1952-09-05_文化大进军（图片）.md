    Cultural Great Advance
    By Peng Bin and Sun Hanchun
    Sixteen. During this study session, I was selected as a study model. Our group usually helped each other very well, so we were chosen as a model group. In the evening, we had a celebration party. The programs were written and performed by ourselves. The best one was the clapper talk "Three Treasures," which was written as follows: "There are three treasures for remembering new characters: First, the phonetic symbols must be learned well. Recognizing characters is like herding cattle and sheep; once you put the symbols on, they can't run away. Second, connecting with life must be done well. If you don't understand, it's hard to remember; you can only remember if you understand. Third, it's most important to look at the shape of the characters. 'Cut,' 'split,' 'chop,' and 'stab' all use 'knife'; 'flower,' 'tea,' and 'seedling' all have 'grass.'"
    Seventeen. After the blitz of new characters was over, we switched to a new subject. The teacher gave each person four books of national language and asked everyone to read them once. During this study session, everyone also learned that a character has several pronunciations, for example, "long" (长) is pronounced as long-term struggle, and "long" (长) is pronounced as the "long" in squad leader. From then on, we began to read newspapers and books. One day, Wang Xuewen finished reading "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and there were only twenty-four new characters. He happily told everyone he met, "I can even read Chairman Mao's articles."
    Eighteen. In the last few days, the teacher taught another method called "New Character Class Formation." He talked about more than a dozen radicals, and Zhou Dabao shouted loudly, "Oh—roll call! 校—'School's 校', those with the wood radical, stand in class one!" "Oh—roll call! 锻—'Forge's 锻', those with the metal radical, stand in class two!" In this way, in one morning, each of us formed almost two hundred characters. Later, we also completely learned how to use the dictionary.

    十六、这次学习，我被选为学习模范，我们的小组，平素互助很好，被大家选为模范组。晚上开了个庆祝会，节目是我们自己编、自己演的。其中最好的是快板“三件宝”，编的是：“记生字有三件宝：第一注音符号要学好，认字好比揽牛羊，挂上符号跑不了。第二联系生活要搞好，不懂也就不好记，能懂才能记得牢。第三多看字形最重要，切剪劈刺都用“刀”，花茶叶苗都有“草”。
    十七、突击生字完了后，就换了新课目。教员发给每人四本国语，要大家读一遍。在这次学习中，大家又学会了一个字有好几个念法，比方“长”（彳尢）念长期奋斗，“长”（ㄓ尢（念班长的“长”。从此以后我们就开始阅读书报。有一天王学文读完了“论人民民主专政”，只有二十四个生字，他高兴地见人就说：“连毛主席的文章，我也能读了。”
    十八、最后几天，教员又教了一个办法叫“生字编班”。他讲了十几种偏旁，周大保就大声叫着“噢—点名喽！校—学校的“校”，木字边的站到一班去！”“噢—点名喽！锻炼的‘锻’，金字边的，站到二班去！”就这样，一个上午，我们每人都差不多编了二百来字。以后连查字典也完全学会了。
