    The Achievements of the People's Railway in the Past Three Years
    Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government

    The People's Republic of China has been born for three years. Over the past three years, under the correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the People's Railway, as a component of the people's economy, has overcome numerous difficulties, basically completed the restoration and reconstruction work, and focused on completing and continuing the construction of new lines. This is a significant contribution to developing the economy, consolidating national defense, promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and improving the material and cultural life of the people.

    The Chinese People's Railway gradually developed with the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War. During the People's Liberation War, the central task of the people of the whole country was to strive for the complete victory of the People's Liberation War. The staff and workers of the People's Railway and all the commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army resolutely responded to and implemented Chairman Mao's call: "Wherever the Liberation Army fights, the railway will be built." Regardless of the severe cold and intense heat, braving enemy air raids and the harassment of bandits and secret agents, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the enthusiastic support of the military and civilians in various regions, and with the appropriate guidance of advanced Soviet experience, they launched a magnificent rescue and repair work with tenacious spirit. In 1949 alone, more than 8,000 kilometers of railways were repaired, and 2,715 bridges with a total length of more than 90,000 meters were restored. In this way, they overcame the serious damage to the railway by the Kuomintang reactionaries at the highest speed, ensured the transportation of troops and military supplies, and powerfully supported the victorious advance of the Liberation War.

    After the liberation of the whole country, the Chinese people shifted from striving for the complete victory of the Liberation War to a new period of consolidating victory and restoring and developing the economy. As is well known, in a country as vast as ours, it is impossible to develop the economy without efficient railway transportation to connect the industrial areas and the vast agricultural areas into a complete economic system. To this end, the state made large investments to strengthen and improve the original lines, requiring the railway to improve efficiency and adapt to the overall task of restoring and developing the national economy. We have successfully completed this task, and the railway has taken on a new look, and the speed of trains has been greatly improved. It is especially worth mentioning the achievements of the reinforcement and improvement project of the Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. This bridge is five kilometers long from the South Station to the North Station of the Yellow River. Before liberation, trains could only be pulled by small locomotives when crossing the Yellow River Bridge, and more than 20 carriages had to be passed twice; the train took three hours to cross the bridge. After our improvement, a train can be pulled by a large locomotive normally without decomposition; the train crossing time is shortened to 22 minutes, and recently shortened to 5 minutes, and the transportation speed is increased by 35 times.

    In the past three years, the People's Railway has reversed the situation of decentralized management and independent administration during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, implemented a highly unified management system, widely promoted the responsibility system in transportation, machinery, engineering, and telecommunications departments, and implemented unified planned transportation in coordination with the state's unified economic construction plan. Therefore, transportation efficiency has been continuously improved. Taking the turnaround time of vehicles, which is a concentrated expression of railway work efficiency, as an example, it was 3.34 days in 1950, shortened to 3.22 days in 1951, and averaged 2.90 days in the first half of 1952. In terms of the daily mileage of freight locomotives, it was 278 kilometers in 1949, increased to 374.6 kilometers in 1951, exceeding the highest record of 254 kilometers in the history of Chinese railways by 47.5 percent, and further increased to 416.6 kilometers in the first half of this year. In terms of the average total tonnage of freight trains, it increased by 8.6 percent in 1951 compared with 1950, exceeding the highest record in the history of Chinese railways by 48.6 percent, and further increased by 11.9 percent in the first half of 1952 compared with 1951. In terms of the average net load of vehicles, it increased by 6 percent in July 1952 compared with the same month in 1951. In terms of the number of locomotives running 500 kilometers per day, in April 1952, the number of locomotives running 500 kilometers per day accounted for only 29.5 percent of the total number of freight locomotives in the country, and increased to 43 percent in July. These figures powerfully show that the People's Railway has changed the backward state caused by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the Chinese railway system, and is rapidly advancing to a higher level. In 1950, the People's Railway vigorously carried out the transfer of materials, and the transportation of major materials such as coal, grain, salt, cotton, steel, wood, and minerals all overfulfilled the plan and completed the state's annual transportation plan ahead of schedule, which played a great role in stabilizing prices. In 1951, although the transportation task increased by 80 percent compared with 1950, it also overfulfilled and completed the annual transportation plan ahead of schedule, closely coordinating with the needs of industrial production, water conservancy construction, and agricultural development. Due to the smooth flow of railways, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has become unprecedentedly active, greatly promoting the development of the people's economy, and playing a huge role in improving the lives of people across the country, especially farmers.

    The People's Railway followed the general policy of the state to develop production and prosper the economy, and implemented a low freight rate policy. In addition to a few luxury goods with higher freight rates, the freight rates of general necessities of life and industrial and agricultural production tools and means of production, such as grains, wood, coal, minerals, cement, machinery, and steel, are classified as lower grades. Coal is the driving force for the development of industry. According to the needs of the overall economic development of the country, the People's Railway has reduced the freight rate of coal to below the transportation cost. For native products and export goods, various preferential special prices have also been formulated according to the needs of the country and seasonal changes.

    The People's Railway has also fundamentally changed the bad practices of the Kuomintang rule in passenger transportation services. It has rectified the past dilapidated, dirty, and crowded phenomena of passenger cars, abolished the unreasonable system that dining cars only serve first- and second-class cars, so that every passenger can dine in the dining car. In addition, passenger fares have also been greatly reduced, accounting for only 33.5 percent of the fares before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Many trains have specially set up special carriages for women, children, and non-smoking passengers. Major stations have added mother and baby waiting rooms, unmanned bookstores, hospitals, canteens, etc. Attendants and train attendants treat passengers with a kind and friendly attitude and help passengers solve difficulties. The speed of passenger trains has also been significantly improved. The express train from Beijing to Manzhouli is now 11 hours and 32 minutes shorter than in 1951. The express train from Beijing to Shanghai is 3 hours and 12 minutes shorter than in 1951, and 4 hours and 15 minutes shorter than the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai railway in 1937. The express train from Beijing to Hankou is 6 hours and 30 minutes shorter than in 1951. The express train from Shanghai to Guangzhou is 4 hours and 30 minutes shorter than in 1951. Regarding cargo owners, the bureaucratic style of the old railway in the past has also been changed, and a proactive attitude of serving cargo owners has been adopted, humbly listening to cargo owners' opinions, thereby strengthening the connection between the railway and cargo owners. The implementation of responsible transportation has reduced the burden on cargo owners, and the cargo transportation business has been further developed. These have been universally praised by the vast number of people across the country.

    The People's Railway, due to the implementation of the principles of socialist enterprise management and the focus on promoting the economic accounting system, has not only overfulfilled the transportation tasks assigned by the state, but also overfulfilled the financial income tasks assigned by the state, fundamentally changing the situation of railway losses year after year during the Kuomintang rule, and accumulating huge wealth for the country.

    In order to develop the people's economy and develop inland resources, the Central People's Government has invested heavily in building new roads since the second half of 1950. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions of "self-reliance," "mass participation, and local materials," absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and started the construction of new lines with hundreds of thousands of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force. As of the end of August 1952, a total of 1,255 kilometers of railways have been built in two years, which is greatly beneficial to the economic prosperity of the southwest and northwest. Such large-scale construction could not have been achieved in old China. Take the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as an example: The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is 505 kilometers long. From the planning and construction of the "Manchu Qing" dynasty to the liberation of the southwest, for more than 40 years, the people of Sichuan have paid countless money, shed countless blood, and carried out countless heroic and fierce struggles for this road. However, the reactionaries did not even lay a single rail. Less than half a year after the liberation of the southwest, we started construction on June 15, 1950 with domestic materials, and the entire line was opened to traffic on July 1 this year after only two years. In the process of road construction in the past three years, the Chinese working people have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity, invented and improved a large number of tools, and greatly improved labor productivity. For example, the staff and workers who built the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway created the speed of laying five kilometers of track per day; when the Tianlan Road was building a two-kilometer-long tunnel, the staff and workers created a record of digging 8.5 meters of guide holes per day. During road construction, due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we quickly mastered the technology of mountain road construction, laying a good foundation for large-scale road construction in the future. Every time we build a railway, people along the line are jubilant, hanging lanterns and festoons to welcome the train. They call these roads "roads to a happy life," expressing infinite gratitude and love for Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government.

    The fundamental reason for obtaining the above achievements is that we have resolutely carried out the general policy of "relying on the working class, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, to run the People's Railway well." In the past three years, we have completed the democratic reform work, eliminated the counter-revolutionary elements hidden inside the railway, abolished the old management system that oppressed workers, established a democratic management system, and promoted a large number of outstanding workers to production leadership positions. Therefore, the wisdom and labor enthusiasm of the working class have been greatly brought into play. In addition, the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts has enabled us to smoothly overcome all difficulties in our work.

    Because the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is combined with the labor enthusiasm of the working class, a vigorous production and labor competition has been launched on the entire railway, and a large number of heroic model figures have emerged. Such as labor model Li Yong, who once led the Mao Zedong locomotive, Guo Shude, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, Tian Guiying, the first female driver in the country, and Wang Jingbin, the telephone operator of the Andong Railway who insisted on working during the crazy bombing by American aircraft. Such as Zheng Xikun, Li Xikui, Yang Maolin, Guo Chunlin, etc., created Zheng Xikun's over-axis 500-kilometer operation method, Li Xikui's shunting method, Yang Maolin's loading method, and Guo Chunlin's road maintenance method and other advanced working methods, which are currently being promoted nationwide. Driven by these advanced model figures, railway employees across the country have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. In 1950, a total of 4,972 rationalization proposals were adopted by the national railway. In 1951, a total of 42,749 proposals were put forward, and 29,249 were adopted and promoted. There were 3,842 creations and inventions, 7,243 improved tools, and 6,156 improved operating methods. The potential power of the People's Railway has been tapped, efficiency has been improved, and huge wealth has been saved for the country.

    Now we are enthusiastically carrying out the movement of full loading, over-axis, and 500 kilometers. Through this movement, we will further improve and improve the work of the People's Railway. The vigorous development of various competition movements on the railway not only encourages the production enthusiasm of the masses, but also powerfully strikes at conservatism, laying a good foundation for the further implementation of strict planned management in the People's Railway, and creating extremely favorable conditions for the comprehensive implementation of the economic accounting system in the railway system.

    In the past three years, railway work has made great achievements; however, the current situation is far from meeting the needs of the upcoming large-scale economic construction. In the future, not only should the operating lines be managed better, but more importantly, greater efforts should be concentrated on building new lines at a faster speed, overcoming all difficulties in capital construction, so as to develop the people's economy, consolidate national defense, and safeguard world peace.

    三年来人民铁道的成就
    中央人民政府铁道部部长  滕代远
    中华人民共和国诞生已三周年了。三年来，在伟大的领袖毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，作为人民经济组成部分之一的人民铁道，战胜了重重困难，基本上完成了恢复与改造工作，重点完成了并继续完成着新线建设。这是对发展经济、巩固国防、促进城乡物资交流和改善人民物质、文化生活的重大贡献。
    中国人民铁道，是随着中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利逐渐发展起来的。在人民解放战争期间，全国人民的中心任务是争取人民解放战争的彻底胜利。人民铁道的职工和中国人民解放军铁道兵团的全体指挥员、战斗员，坚决响应并实现了毛主席提出的：“解放军打到那里，铁路就修到那里”的号召。他们不顾严寒酷暑，冒着敌机的轰炸和土匪特务的骚扰，在共产党和人民政府的正确领导及各地军、民的热烈支援下，在苏联先进经验的恰切指导下，以顽强的精神，展开了规模雄伟的抢修工作。仅在一九四九年一年中，就抢修了八千多公里的铁路，修复了两千七百十五座总延长九万余公尺的桥梁。就这样，他们以最高的速度战胜了国民党反动派对铁路的严重破坏，保证了大军和军用物资的运输，有力地支援了解放战争的胜利进军。
    全国解放后，中国人民由争取解放战争彻底胜利转入巩固胜利、恢复与发展经济的新时期。如所周知，像我们这样幅员辽阔的国家，如果没有效率良好的铁路运输，把工业区和广大农业区联成一个完整的经济体系，要发展经济是不可能的。为此，国家以大量投资补强与改善原有的线路，要求铁路提高效率，适应恢复与发展国民经济的总任务。这个任务我们是胜利地完成了，铁道面貌已焕然一新，行车速度已大大提高。特别值得提出的是京汉线黄河大桥加固改善工程的成就。这个大桥从黄河南站到北站共长五公里。解放前，列车过黄河大桥时只能用小型机车牵引，二十几个车箱要分两次通过；列车过桥时间要三小时。经过我们改善后，可用大型机车牵引一列车正常通过，不必分解；列车过桥时间缩短到二十二分钟，最近更缩短到五分钟，运输速度提高了三十五倍。
    三年来，人民铁路一反国民党反动统治时期的分散管理各自为政的状况，实行了高度统一的管理制度，在运输、机务、工务、电务等各部门广泛推行了负责制，并且配合着国家统一的经济建设计划，实行了统一的计划运输。因此，运输效率不断提高。以集中表现铁路工作效率的车辆周转时间来说，一九五○年为三点三四天，一九五一年缩短为三点二二天，一九五二年上半年平均达到二点九○天。以货物机车每日走行公里来说，一九四九年为二百七十八公里，一九五一年提高为三百七十四点六公里，超过中国铁道历史最高纪录二百五十四公里的百分之四七点五，今年上半年又提高到四百一十六点六公里。以货物列车平均牵引总吨数来说，一九五一年比一九五○年提高了百分之八点六，超过中国铁道历史最高纪录百分之四八点六，一九五二年上半年又比一九五一年提高了百分之一一点九。以车辆平均净载重来说，一九五二年七月份比一九五一年同月份提高了百分之六。以每日走行五百公里的机车台数来说，一九五二年四月份，每日走行五百公里的机车只占全国货运机车总台数的百分之二九点五，七月份就增加到百分之四三。这些数字有力地说明人民铁道已改变了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国铁路系统所造成的落后状态，正在迅速地向更高的水平前进。一九五○年，人民铁道大力进行物资调运工作，煤、粮、盐、棉花、钢铁、木材、矿石等主要物资的运输，都超额完成了计划并提前完成了国家全年的运输计划，对稳定物价起了很大作用。一九五一年，虽然运输任务比一九五○年增加了百分之八十，同样超额和提前完成了全年运输计划，密切配合了工业生产、水利建设和农业发展的需要。由于铁路的畅通，城乡物资交流空前地活跃起来，大大促进了人民经济的发展，对全国人民特别是农民生活的改善起了极大的作用。
    人民铁道遵循国家发展生产，繁荣经济的总方针，实行了低运价政策。除了少数奢侈品运价较高外，一般民生必需品和工、农业生产工具、生产资料，如粮谷、木材、煤、矿石、洋灰、机器、钢铁等的运价，均列为较低等级。煤是发展工业的动力，根据国家整体经济发展的需要，人民铁道把煤的运价降低到运输成本以下。对于土产和出口物资等，也根据国家的需要及季节变化制定了多种优待的特价。
    人民铁道在旅客运送业务上也根本改变了国民党统治时期的恶劣作风。整顿了过去客车的破旧、肮脏和拥挤现象，废除了餐车专为头二等车服务的不合理的制度，使每位旅客都可以在餐车进餐。此外，旅客票价也大为减低，仅占抗日战争前票价的百分之三十三点五。很多列车特为妇女幼童及不吸烟的旅客设置了专门的车厢。主要车站添设了母子候车室、无人售书处、医院处、食堂等。乘务员列车员们都以和蔼可亲的态度对待旅客，帮助旅客解决困难。旅客列车的速度也显著的提高了。现在北京直达满洲里的快车比一九五一年缩短了十一小时又三十二分钟。北京至上海快车较一九五一年缩短了三小时又十二分钟，比一九三七年京沪通车缩短四小时又十五分钟。北京至汉口快车比一九五一年缩短了六小时又三十分钟。上海至广州快车比一九五一年缩短了四小时又三十分钟。对待货主，也改变了过去旧铁路的衙门作风，采取了积极为货主服务的态度，虚心听取货主意见，从而加强了铁路与货主间的联系。实行了负责运输，减轻了货主的负担，使货运业务有了进一步的开展。这些都受到全国广大人民的普遍赞扬。
    人民铁道由于实行了社会主义企业管理的原则，重点地推行了经济核算制，因而，不仅超额完成了国家所给予的运输任务，而且超额完成了国家所给予的财务收入任务，根本改变了国民党统治时期铁路年年亏本的局面，为国家积累了巨大的财富。
    为了发展人民经济，开发内地资源，中央人民政府自一九五○年下半年起，即以大量投资修筑新路。我们遵照毛主席指示的：“自力更生”、“群策群力，就地取材”的方针，在广大人民的热情支持下，吸取了苏联的先进经验，以数十万工农兵大军为主体，开始了新线建设。截至一九五二年八月底止，两年内业已修筑了共长一千二百五十五公里的铁路。大大有利于西南、西北的经济繁荣。这样大规模的建设，在旧中国是不能实现的。拿成渝路来说：成渝路全长五百零五公里，从“满清”王朝筹筑起到西南解放止，四十多年来，四川人民为了这条路，出过无数钱，流过无数血，进行了无数次英勇激烈的斗争。可是反动派连一根钢轨也没铺上。西南解放不到半年，我们即以本国的器材，于一九五○年六月十五日动工修筑，经过短短两年，至今年七月一日便全线通车了。在三年来修路过程中，中国的劳动人民发挥了高度的劳动积极性和创造性，发明和改良了大量工具，大大提高了劳动生产率。如修筑成渝铁路的职工创造了每天铺轨五公里的速度；天兰路修筑一座两公里长的隧道时，职工创造了每天打导洞八点五公尺的纪录。筑路时，我们由于学习了苏联的先进经验，使我们迅速地掌握了山地筑路的技术，为今后大规模筑路打下了良好的基础。我们每修通一条铁路，沿线的人们到处欢欣鼓舞，悬灯结彩，来欢迎火车。他们称这些路是“通往幸福生活的道路”，对毛主席，共产党和人民政府，表现出无限的感激和爱戴。
    获得以上成就的根本原因，是由于我们坚决贯彻了“依靠工人阶级，学习苏联先进经验，办好人民铁路”的总方针。三年来，我们完成了民主改革工作，清除了隐藏在铁路内部的反革命分子，废除了旧的压迫工人的管理制度，建立了民主管理制度，提拔了大批的优秀工人到生产领导岗位上来。因此，极大地发挥了工人阶级的智慧和劳动积极性。再加上苏联专家对我们的热情帮助，使我们得以顺利地克服了工作中的一切困难。
    又由于苏联先进经验与工人阶级的劳动热情相结合，在全路开展了轰轰烈烈的生产劳动竞赛，涌现出大批的英雄模范人物。如曾经领导毛泽东号机车的劳动模范李永、毛泽东号机车司机长郭树德、全国第一名女司机田桂英及在美机疯狂轰炸下坚持工作岗位的安东铁路电话员王静彬等。又如郑锡坤、李锡奎、杨茂林、郭春林等，创造了郑锡坤超轴五百公里作业法、李锡奎调车法、杨茂林装车法及郭春林养路法等先进工作方法，目前正在全国推广。在这些先进模范人物的带动下，全国铁路员工提出了大量的合理化建议。一九五○年全国铁路合理化建议被采纳的共有四千九百七十二件。一九五一年共提出四万二千七百四十九件，被采纳推广的有二万九千二百四十九件。并有创造发明三千八百四十二件，改良工具七千二百四十三件，改进操作方法六千一百五十六件。发掘了人民铁路的潜在力量，提高了效率，为国家节约了巨额的财富。
    现在我们正热烈开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，通过这一运动进一步改进和提高人民铁道的工作。铁路上各种竞赛运动的蓬勃发展，不但鼓舞了群众的生产热情，并且有力地打击了保守主义，为人民铁路进一步实行严格的计划管理打下了良好的基础，并为铁路系统中全面贯彻经济核算制创造了极为有利的条件。
    三年来，铁路工作取得了很大成就；但目前的情况，还远不能满足即将到来的大规模经济建设的需要。今后不仅要把营业线路管理得更好，更重要的是要集中更大的力量，以更快的速度建设新线，克服基本建设中的一切困难，以发展人民经济、巩固国防、保卫世界和平。
