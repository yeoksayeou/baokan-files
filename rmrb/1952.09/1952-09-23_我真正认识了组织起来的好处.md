    I Truly Realized the Benefits of Being Organized
    Comrade Editor: I used to be a poor, lonely old woman. My husband and son both died from the oppression and exploitation of the landlords. After the land reform, I was allocated 1.8 mu of land. I was both happy and worried. Happy because the landlords were overthrown and I got land; worried because I was already sixty-two years old and couldn't farm. At this time, Lai Sinian, a labor model from our village, returned from a meeting in the province and promoted the idea of getting rich by organizing. At that time, I ignored his words. Later, I saw that there were also women working in the mutual aid team, and everyone was evaluating work and assigning points, so no one suffered a loss. I joined the mutual aid team. After this, I didn't have to worry at all. In the team, I only did small things, such as pulling wheat sprouts, weeding, and catching insects. For one day of work, the team gave me 2.5 to 3.5 work points. When settling accounts, I not only didn't have to pay, but I also earned 15 work points. I truly experienced the benefits of joining the mutual aid team. In our village, there is a strong young farmer named Li Damei, with a family of six, and his wife also works. During the land reform, they were allocated 5.5 mu of land. He didn't join the mutual aid team. During the spring famine, they had financial difficulties. The couple made a small business to make a living. If they took care of their living, they couldn't take care of production, so they had to rent out 1.4 mu of land, pawn out 0.8 mu of land, and also borrowed 200 jin of grain from others. You see, he is a thirty-seven-year-old young man, and I am a sixty-two-year-old old woman. He has two main laborers, and I don't have any main laborers, but now he is the one in trouble, not me.

    我真正认识了组织起来的好处
    编辑同志：我过去是一个穷困孤苦的老婆婆，丈夫和儿子都在地主的压迫剥削下病死了。土地改革后，我分得一亩八分地。我真是又喜又忧。喜的是打倒了地主，分到了土地；忧的是自己已经六十二岁，种不了田。这时候村里的劳动模范赖思念从省里开会回来，宣传组织起来由贫变富的道理。当时我不理会他的话，后来看见互助组里也有女人下田，并且大家都评工计分，谁也不吃亏，我就参加了互助组。这以后，我一点也不用发愁了。在组里我专做小事，拔麦头、除草、抓虫等等。我做一天工，组里给我记二分半到三分半工。结账时，我不但不用出钱，还长出十五分工。我真正体验到参加互助组的好处了。我们村里有个壮年农民李大妹，一家六口，老婆也劳动；土地改革时分了五亩五分田；他没有参加互助组，春荒时生活困难，夫妇两人做小买卖糊口，顾了生活就顾不到生产，只好租出一亩四分田，典出八分田，还向别人借了二百斤谷子。你们看，他是三十七岁的小伙子，我是六十二岁的老婆婆，他有两个主要劳动力，我没有主要劳动力，可是现在困难的是他不是我。
