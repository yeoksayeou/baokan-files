    The Problem of Labor Models Spending Too Much Time in Meetings and Delaying Production Urgently Needs to Be Solved
　　Editor: This year, Liling County, Hunan Province, had a bumper harvest of early rice. The county held an experience exchange conference on patriotic bumper harvests for 519 people from August 22nd to 25th. During the conference, Li Chenggui, Chen Keyou, Tang Huaxiang, Chen Guifu, Qi Jingxiu (female), Luo Yunhua, and Fu Shunzhi, seven well-known model mutual aid team leaders in the county, all reflected that they were delayed in production time due to excessive meetings. Just considering the time spent attending meetings and visiting in the county, Fu Shunzhi and Luo Yunhua each spent 77 days, and Tang Huaxiang, the least, spent 49 days. Although the time spent in district and township meetings was shorter, the frequency was higher, and it is estimated that the time occupied would not be less than the time spent in county meetings. Chen Guifu said: "No matter what happens, there is always a need for labor models and mutual aid team leaders. This year, I have only been at home for about two months." Luo Yunhua only spent 54 days doing full labor at home this year. The more production time they delayed, the less their income became. Fu Shunzhi's mutual aid team has more than 10,000 jin of public accumulation funds, but the team leader only accounts for a small portion. Chen Keyou's mutual aid team had nearly 5 million yuan in sideline production income this year, but team leader Chen Keyou only earned more than 100,000 yuan. Therefore, some people have developed the idea of not wanting to be team leaders. As Fu Shunzhi said: "It's better to be a team member, being a team leader is a hard loss. Some people want to organize mutual aid teams, but when they see that being a team leader is not easy, they don't do it."
　　As far as I know, the leading organs at all levels in Liling County have emphasized "labor models should not be used as cadres and their production should not be delayed" in the issue of cultivating labor models, but judging from the above situation, this principle has not actually been achieved. I think that the leading organs at all levels should not regard labor models as "omnipotent" people, but should strengthen their political and ideological education and help them lead the mutual aid teams well, so that they can devote their energy to production and truly play a bridging, leading, and backbone role.　　　Yi Haomei
　　Editor's Note: The situation reflected by Comrade Yi Haomei is very important. This newspaper has raised this issue several times, but this issue has not been resolved in many regions. We hope that rural cadres and labor models in various places will write to us with their opinions on solving this problem.

### 劳动模范开会过多耽误生产的问题亟应解决

    劳动模范开会过多耽误生产的问题亟应解决
　　编辑同志：今年湖南醴陵县早稻丰收。全县在八月二十二日至二十五日举行了五百一十九人的爱国丰产经验交流大会。在会议期间，李呈桂、陈可友、唐花香、陈桂夫、漆敬秀（女）、骆运华、傅顺芝等七个全县著名的模范互助组长都反映他们因开会过多，耽误了生产时间。只说到县里开会和参观所占用的时间，傅顺芝、骆运华每人七十七天，最少的唐花香也用了四十九天。区乡开会的时间虽然比较短，但次数多，估计所占的时间比在县里开会所占的时间也不会少。陈桂夫说：“不论什么事情，总少不了劳动模范和互助组长。今年我在家的时间只有两个月光景。”骆运华今年在家做一个整工的时间只有五十四天。他们耽误的生产时间多，收入也就减少了。傅顺芝互助组有一万多斤谷子的公积金，但组长占的很少。陈可友互助组今年副业生产收入近五百万元，但组长陈可友仅收入十多万元。因此，有的人就产生了不愿当组长的思想。如傅顺芝说：“当组员就好，当组长硬吃亏。有些人想组织互助组，看见组长不好当，也就不搞了。”
　　据我所知，醴陵县各级领导机关在培养劳动模范的问题上，曾强调“不能把劳动模范当干部使用，不能耽搁他们的生产”，但从上述情况看来，这种原则实际上并没有做到。我认为各级领导机关不应当把劳动模范当成“万能”的人，应对他们加强政治思想教育；帮助他们领导好互助组，使他们能把精力用到生产上去，真正发挥桥梁、带头、骨干作用。　　　易浩梅
　　编者按：易浩梅同志反映的这个情况很重要。本报曾经几次提出这个问题，但这个问题在许多地区都还没有解决。我们希望各地农村干部和劳动模范，把解决这个问题的意见写给我们。
