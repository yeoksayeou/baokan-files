    IV. After I joined the army in 1949, my commander said, "An army without culture is a foolish army!" That year, I set a three-year plan, thinking that if I learned three characters a day, I could learn three thousand in three years. However, even learning three or two characters was difficult, and I would forget almost everything when the central task came. Later, during the advance into Southwest China, I couldn't spare time to study. In 1950, I was busy suppressing bandits, and by the end of the year, I had only learned a little over a hundred characters.
    V. In 1951, the leadership promoted me to squad leader, and the difficulties of lacking cultural knowledge became even more apparent. I couldn't take notes during meetings, and my reports were incomplete. When the regulations on internal affairs were issued, those who could read could understand them, but I could only listen to the commander's explanation, and I still only remembered half and forgot the other half. I thought that if we want to build a modern national defense force, without culture, there is a huge obstacle in front of us.
    VI. At the end of July, the company decided to transfer me to the military region to study culture, and I heard that I could learn two thousand characters in a month. My initial thought was the same as everyone else's. I thought, I've only learned three hundred characters in two and a half years, and now I'm supposed to learn two thousand characters in a month, it's impossible to cram it all in even if I break my head. Before I left, the political instructor told me, "Go boldly! The leadership of the superiors is correct, and following the Party will lead to victory." This strengthened my confidence in studying.

    文化大进军

    四、我在一九四九年参军后听首长说：“没有文化的军队，就是愚蠢的军队！”那年我就订了个三年计划，心想一天学三个字，三年也学它三千个。但是，别看三个两个字好学，中心任务一来就忘得差不多了。后来，进军大西南，就顾不上学了。一九五○年又赶上剿匪，到年底，紧学慢学才学会了一百多字。
    五、一九五一年，领导上提升我当班长，没有文化知识的困难就更明显了。开会不能记录，汇报不全面。内务条令发下来，人家认识字的就能看，我只能听首长讲，还是记一半，忘一半。我想咱们要建设现代化国防军，没有文化，面前就挡着一条大障碍。
    六、七月底，连部决定调我到军区去学文化，听说一个月能认两千字。我当时的想法，也跟大家一样。我想，学了二年半才认了三百多字，这一个月就学二千字，真是敲破脑袋也装不进去。临走时指导员对我讲：“大胆去吧！上级的领导是正确的，跟着党走就能胜利”。才坚定了我的学习信心。
