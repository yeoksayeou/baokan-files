    Implementing the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work"
    -- A Summary of the Discussion on "Construction is Impossible Without Correct Engineering Design"
    By the Editorial Department of this Newspaper
    (I)
　　In June of last year, this newspaper launched a discussion centered on "Construction is Impossible Without Correct Engineering Design," exposing and criticizing many errors in capital construction. In October of the same year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government dispatched six inspection teams to conduct spot checks on nine units engaged in capital construction within the customs area, further discovering many problems. On January 9th of this year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central Government issued the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work," putting forward the guidelines and procedures for capital construction. This document provided a practical summary of the above discussion and inspection.
　　The "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" were formulated in response to the actual problems we discovered in past capital construction, combined with the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. It clearly stipulates the guidelines, principles, discipline, and procedures for future capital construction work. The implementation of these measures can ensure that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past.
    Based on three years of experience, the main contradiction in capital construction is the contradiction between centralization, planning, and decentralization, blindness. The two aspects of this contradiction are reflected in the struggle between two ideologies and two lines. This is the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, the struggle between the socialist line and the capitalist line in capital construction.
    As early as 1940, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The state-owned economy in the New Democratic Republic under the leadership of the proletariat is socialist in nature and is the leading force of the entire national economy" (see On New Democracy). Article 28 of the Common Program also stipulates: "The state-owned economy is an economy of a socialist nature." The Common Program also stipulates the general policy for industrial construction: "Should focus on the planned and step-by-step restoration and development of heavy industry... to create the foundation for national industrialization..." This is the requirement of a New Democratic state for the state-owned economy, that is, for capital construction. However, our foundation or conditions have factors that are contrary to this requirement, namely: First, the colonial and semi-colonial nature of the state economy in old China and the resulting backwardness, decentralization, and blindness are precisely in contradiction with the planned state economy of a socialist nature that we want to build. Second, the personnel currently engaged in capital construction work, including technical personnel and management personnel, mainly come from the old society, and they are tainted with strong bourgeois ideas; and many privately-owned enterprises participate in construction projects and some orders. They have serious blindness and speculation, which often contradicts the needs of the state. Third, many of our leading cadres still lack experience in large-scale capital construction, and many people have rural and supply-system viewpoints and styles to varying degrees, and these viewpoints and styles are also in contradiction with the new tasks of national construction. Therefore, in a series of past capital construction works, various deviations will inevitably occur in planning, design, construction, and the use of funds.
    At the same time, experience has also proved that to do a good job in industrial capital construction, it is not only necessary to master the resource situation, meet the necessary technical and mechanical equipment, and unify the specifications of building materials and the standards of design; but also to have closely connected work organizations and division of labor, and to formulate various work systems, work procedures, and so on. Without these, the design and construction of any project will inevitably be impossible to start, or the effect will be poor, or it will fail completely.
    Of course, all conditions are created by people, and they are constantly changing with people's work. Therefore, for all personnel engaged in capital construction work, how to grasp the New Democratic guidelines for capital construction, grasp the existing conditions, and maximize their effectiveness, and constantly overcome difficulties to create new conditions, is the key to the success or failure of capital construction work.
    (II)
    Although there have been considerable achievements in capital construction work in the past three years, the results of the implementation of the capital construction plan are not very good. Taking heavy industry within the customs area as an example, there were a total of sixty-one capital construction units within the customs area in 1951, of which forty-seven started in 1951, and fourteen were carry-over projects from 1950. The total amount of work completed by the sixty-one construction units in 1951 was only 60% of the total planned amount, with the highest completion rate being 75% and the lowest being 37%. The above-mentioned fourteen carry-over units should have completed all plans in 1950, but only one unit completed the plan by the end of 1951. And the total amount of work completed by the sixty-one units in 1951 was not all put into production or used.
    Many comrades have separately attributed the reasons for the failure to complete the plan to the following points, namely: state allocations are slow or not timely, material supply is not timely, technical personnel are insufficient, there is a lack of design and construction manpower, leading cadres do not understand technology, lack of work experience, and so on. They concluded that it is not possible to implement the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" now.
    Is this view correct? Obviously not. Slow allocation of funds, lack of cadres, etc. are indeed facts, but the fundamental problem does not lie here. The situation of those units that failed to complete the plan in the above two years cannot be explained by the slow allocation of funds, nor can it be explained by the lack of technical personnel, because since there is a lack of technical personnel, why not prioritize and rush to do many things? This is clearly an error in guiding ideology, resulting in unrealistic plans. For example, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant spent hundreds of billions of yuan in 1950 to build the factory buildings of the repair and manufacturing department. After completion, some factory buildings changed their usage plans due to non-urgent needs, and some factory buildings had no machines. The plant spent more than 10 billion yuan to mine the Dingxiang iron ore in two years, and was finally forced to stop work because the upper iron ore had been mined out. For another example, the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau revised its plan in 1950 to be sixteen times larger than the original task, but only completed 29%. The Datong Mining Bureau spent 6.3 billion yuan to build factory buildings without machines and technical personnel. Such examples reflect the blindness in capital construction. The root cause of this blindness is obviously that many of our comrades have unrealistic impatience and departmentalism. And the past facts have proved that the units responsible for construction invariably like to propose large-scale plans and ask for a lot of money. The personnel drafting the plans only propose plans based on general tasks. Some personnel in the higher-level organs also have the eagerness to achieve success with more money and more work. The combination of the upper and lower levels resulted in unrealistic plans. This is of course incompatible with the construction policy of "planned, step-by-step, and focused". Therefore, when examining the reasons why the plan could not be completed in the past, we should first examine the guiding ideology for formulating the plan, and then examine the various conditions for guaranteeing the plan.
    In the implementation of the plan, there is another harmful guiding ideology, which is that with money, everything else is not a problem. The main manifestation of this idea is the wrong view of design work. In the past, many people generally did not pay attention to design, especially the investigation work before design. Many projects started construction after only a cursory design, and the situation of designing while constructing was extremely common. They thought that this would be faster, but the result was the opposite. Since the design is incomplete, it is bound to be constantly changed or neglected, so phenomena such as waiting for drawings and materials to stop work have arisen, and the failure to complete the plan has become a common phenomenon. This is obviously a violation of the objective laws of capital construction.
    Although many plans have been completed, there are also serious problems in them. First of all, there are many errors in engineering design. For example, many of the arch bridges on the Tianlan Railway line have cracks due to foundation settlement and have to be repaired; many of the columns in the main factory building of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant were unevenly sinking by five to six inches before construction was completed, and the beams and columns also developed cracks due to this, and had to be repaired. The Fenhe Dam of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant did not clarify the flow rate and sediment content in advance, and the construction was poor, so it was washed away by water after completion. There are also some designs that only focus on form and appearance without being practical, such as the so-called "glass houses" of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which are cold in winter and hot in summer, making operation difficult, and the roof has been leaking. As for the phenomenon of waste in construction, it is even more serious. In the past, many projects were contracted by private construction merchants or foremen, and some public construction companies were also nominally controlled by private merchants, so the phenomenon of shoddy workmanship was everywhere. Some engineering personnel and management personnel colluded with private merchants to cheat together, stealing state property in large quantities, and the quality of the projects was generally damaged. This situation also hinders the completion of the plan. The waste and inappropriate phenomena in dormitory construction have caused dissatisfaction among the majority of workers. For example, in 1950, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant used one-third of its dormitory investment to build 108 "Class B Dormitories", which were too high in standard and did not match the needs. Many senior employees were unwilling to rent because the cost was too high, while the housing problem of three-quarters of the workers could not be solved. The dormitories built by the Datong Mining Bureau for employees were called "palaces" by the workers, but the housing conditions of many workers have not been improved. The extravagance and waste in dormitories and other auxiliary construction is quite alarming.
　　All of this proves that the guiding ideology of some cadres on capital construction is one-sided. They have relaxed or even abandoned the struggle between the two lines. They have adopted a blindly trusting attitude towards some old technical personnel who have not been transformed and are full of bourgeois ideas, and did not interfere with their erroneous designs, and did not pay attention to the opinions of the masses, mystifying technology and thus not personally mastering and reviewing the important keys in the design. As a result, they let the technical personnel do whatever they wanted, and some of them even "regarded state-owned enterprises and investment as an experimental field for personal fame and fortune" (as the employees of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant commented on a certain engineer). In the past, we were not completely unaware of the theft activities of private construction merchants during construction. In several factories and mines that were sampled, workers and the contractors were found to be fighting, but the leaders did not actively organize the masses to supervise the contractors, fearing that "if they are managed too tightly, the project will not be contracted out." The result of this compromising attitude towards capitalists is only the unscrupulous erosion and theft by illegal capitalists. Many cadres with unstable positions have fallen into the mire of corruption under this erosion. This lesson is painful. From the ideological source of the leading cadres, this is because we have abandoned the leadership of the working class and abandoned the necessary struggle.
    In addition, some of the mistakes in the past were also caused by the organs and cadres in charge of capital construction not asking for instructions or reporting. The above-mentioned repair and manufacturing department project of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was constructed without approval; Lu Da, the former deputy director of the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, also fabricated a project final account of 50.3 billion yuan for the plant. This kind of violation of discipline is dominated by departmentalism that disregards the overall situation. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, this situation has changed, but in the large-scale construction work in the future, we must thoroughly overcome these mistakes.
    (III)
    In order to thoroughly overcome the mistakes we have made in capital construction work in the past, in order to grasp the struggle between the two lines and win the victory of the struggle, in order to make every work step of capital construction conform to objective requirements, in order to better create various conditions to meet the needs of capital construction, we must thoroughly implement the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central Government in the future. The thirty-six articles of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" take industrial construction as the main body, expound the basic laws of our country's capital construction, and ensure that the procedures of capital construction can be smoothly implemented.
　　The measures focus on Section 3 - Design Work, expounding the basic principles of capital construction and the requirements of the project itself. Articles 9 and 10 stipulate that "necessary design documents must be completed in accordance with the design work steps and contents stipulated in these measures before construction, otherwise construction shall not be carried out"; "the submission of the planning task book must conform to the national construction policy and tasks and the national long-term construction plan." These two items are the basic principles that must be followed.
　　For all capital construction, a planning task book is required first. Its content should be stipulated according to the following items, namely: (1) the type of product and its importance in the national economy; (2) the scale of production and its development prospects; (3) the construction site and its relationship with relevant industries; (4) the construction period and its coordination with relevant industries; (5) the estimated amount of investment and the amount of foreign exchange required; (6) resources and economic conditions, including raw material supply and product sales. When formulating the planning task book, "several options can be proposed at the same time, and their advantages and disadvantages can be specifically compared." This can avoid the blindness of the entire plan. Secondly, the "preliminary design" of all capital construction requires it to "explain the technical feasibility and economic rationality of the design object". This is a concrete step to solve the combination of "needs" and "possibilities". For this purpose, necessary investigations and research must be carried out to meet the requirements stipulated in the measures. The third is "technical design", which is the most basic document of capital construction, and is "the clarification and concretization of all regulations and technical issues in the preliminary design". The measures stipulate ten requirements for technical design, and determine that each item must have the necessary documents and drawings, and make a detailed budget of various expenses based on the technical design. Finally, detailed drawings necessary for construction must be made in accordance with the technical design. All capital construction must proceed through these four steps in order to ensure that capital construction is in line with the country's overall construction policy, and to ensure the smooth completion of the project. These steps and the provisions of their content are objective requirements of capital construction, and are not formulated according to other subjective imaginations.
　　In order to realize the planning of capital construction, the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" emphasized the spirit of centralized management. Without centralized management, planning is impossible. To this end, the measures stipulate the following principles: distinguishing construction units into two types, "above the limit" and "below the limit", and four categories: A, B, C, and D, and the specific investment amount of various types of enterprises; stipulating the procedures for the examination and approval of design documents mainly by the central government; stipulating the principle that the construction unit shall not change without authorization after the approval of various design documents; stipulating the system for the preparation, examination and approval of financial budgets and capital construction plans, and the procedures for issuing control figures from top to bottom and preparing draft plans, and designating professional banks to supervise the allocation of funds according to the plan; stipulating the regular reporting system and inspection system for the implementation of capital construction plans, the engineering acceptance system with hierarchical responsibilities, and stipulating unified planning forms, etc. The implementation of these regulations will overcome the inefficiency and the state of decentralization and chaos in capital construction work in the past.
　　The "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" pointed out that the departments at all levels in charge of capital construction and "capital construction units that are also engaged in production" should establish special capital construction agencies to be responsible for leading or carrying out capital construction design, construction, planning, and other work; and require the central competent departments or management bureaus to gradually establish independent design companies and construction and installation contracting companies according to needs and possibilities. These regulations are another important condition to ensure capital construction work. Without strong special capital construction agencies and national design and construction departments, the completion of capital construction tasks cannot be guaranteed. The central competent departments, "when the design institutions are sound or the conditions are ripe, should, as far as possible, compile various standard designs and issue them to the departments under their jurisdiction for adoption, so as to save the strength of design personnel and design costs." At the same time, they should "calculate the labor and material costs of the project final accounts of each construction unit... and make a record of the quotas for the use of materials and labor... as a reference for accumulating experience and gradually improving the quotas." In addition, design companies and construction and installation contracting companies should adopt a contract system and economic accounting system; when carrying out design work, they should pay attention to economy and avoid extravagance and waste; during construction, they should avoid the accumulation of deposits and materials, idle funds, and poor phenomena such as suspension of work and waiting for materials, and avoid waste of labor and materials and shoddy workmanship. These regulations are undoubtedly very necessary.
    Looking at the various regulations of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work", it can be seen that these measures are an important weapon to fight against the various erroneous tendencies that have occurred in the past and may still occur in the future in capital construction. How to grasp, use, and exert the power of this weapon is the most important task for every cadre engaged in capital construction work, especially leading cadres at all levels.
    (IV)
　　Thorough implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" will inevitably lead our country's capital construction to gradually move towards the right track. One of the characteristics of the New Democratic state-owned economy, that is, the economy of a socialist nature, is its high degree of planning. Distinguished from the blind development of capitalist economies, in New Democratic countries, no important construction can be separated from the national plan. Therefore, the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" particularly emphasized the requirements for planning. However, without centralized leadership and management headed by the central government, the realization of planning is impossible. Therefore, these measures also emphasized centralization. Strengthening the planning and centralization of capital construction work is the basic spirit of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work". The purpose of emphasizing planning and centralization is not only to make important construction projects "conform to the overall political and economic tasks of the country in a certain period and the country's long-term construction plan", but also to grasp the technical feasibility and economic rationality of the construction object, so as to ensure project quality and avoid waste, and achieve the goal of being fast, good, and economical.
　　After the promulgation of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work", it has been supported by leading cadres at all levels and the majority of staff. They are working hard to implement it. But there are still some comrades who hold a negative and skeptical attitude towards these measures. Some people are passively waiting, and do not actively create conditions for the rapid development of capital construction. They are afraid of violating the regulations of the higher authorities and making mistakes, and use the excuse of "rather less, but better", but in reality, they are passively slowing down work. Others believe that these measures require too much and the regulations are too strict, making it difficult to implement. They say: Since we are engaged in capital construction, waste is inevitable. These two thoughts essentially believe that the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" are not practical and cannot be realized. If these thoughts are allowed to develop, our country's capital construction plan will be impossible to realize. This part of the cadres and staff engaged in capital construction work with erroneous ideas do not have a sufficient understanding of the spirit of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work", and cannot correctly understand the meaning of "fast, good, and economical", but instead separate them.
    We know that every comrade engaged in capital construction work subjectively wants to be "fast". They believe that the main sign of "fast" is the rapid start of various independent projects. They believe that China has too few industries, and anything done is useful, so it should be done as much and as quickly as possible, without having to spend too much effort on planning. The "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" corrected this mistake, but some comrades have produced another erroneous idea. They believe that in order to implement the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work", they can only do it slowly, only pursue good quality, not fast, and would rather do less than do more. This phenomenon is also worth paying attention to. Comrades with the above two erroneous ideas usually oppose "fast, good, and economical". They believe that to be fast, it cannot be good, and it cannot be economical; to be good, you can only spend more money and do it slowly; to be economical, you can only do it badly. So, how should we understand the principle of "fast, good, and economical"? "Fast, good, and economical" are three aspects of one principle. It is wrong to abandon any aspect. Emphasizing only speed without regard to quality and economy will cause a lot of rework, and of course, it cannot be fast. Many facts have already proved this. Emphasizing only good quality and economy without regard to speed will make the country's capital construction plan impossible to realize. Only by unifying the three and achieving fast, good, and economical results can we have the correct guiding principle. This is the basic idea that we should establish when carrying out capital construction work.
　　The so-called "fast" not only refers to the fast construction progress of a project, but also refers to the fast construction of the country first. From this, it can be understood that every important project must conform to the country's construction plan, otherwise, even if it is built very quickly, it has delayed the country's construction because it has occupied money that should not have been used. The so-called "good" not only refers to the good quality of the construction project or mechanical equipment itself, but also must be suitable for use and conform to objective needs. The practice of only focusing on formal aesthetics and disregarding practicality is absolutely unacceptable. The so-called "economical" not only requires that the design and construction of each project should be carefully calculated to save manpower, material resources, and financial resources, but also should grasp the principles proposed by Comrade Chen Yun in his report at the National Financial Conference in February 1950, "Waste is a serious mistake. Our financial and economic workers should not be talking about the issue of whether or not there is corruption, that is the standard of old China, and our standard is not only that we cannot be corrupt, but also the issue of whether materials are used appropriately or not. The so-called appropriateness is: the issue of late use, early use, overuse, underuse, first use, later use, slow use, and urgent use. Only when it is used appropriately can it not be wasted." This is the understanding we should have of "fast, good, and economical." Failure to understand this way will lead to mistakes.
    The struggle between the two lines reflected in capital construction work will continue in the future, because the bourgeois ideological viewpoints still exist in large quantities in our team, especially among engineering and technical personnel; this inevitably has various impacts on us. Therefore, actively grasping the struggle between the two lines and winning the victory of the struggle is the key to whether capital construction work can be done well, and it is also the key to the thorough implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work".

    贯彻执行“基本建设工作暂行办法”
    ——关于“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”讨论的总结
    本报编辑部
    （一）
　　本报在去年六月以“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”为中心，发动讨论，揭露和批判了基本建设中的许多错误；同年十月，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会派遣了六个检查组，抽查了关内九个进行基本建设的单位，进一步发现了许多问题。今年一月九日，中央财政经济委员会发布了“基本建设工作暂行办法”，提出了关于基本建设的方针和程序。这个文件，给上述的讨论和检查作了实际的总结。
　　“基本建设工作暂行办法”，是针对我们过去在基本建设中所发现的实际问题，结合苏联的先进经验而制定的。它明确地规定了今后进行基本建设工作的方针、原则、纪律和程序，这个办法的贯彻执行可以保证我们不会再重复过去的错误。
    根据三年来的经验，基本建设中的主要矛盾是集中性、计划性与分散性、盲目性的矛盾。这个矛盾的两个方面反映为两种思想和两条路线的斗争。这就是在基本建设中的无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争、社会主义路线和资本主义路线的斗争。
    远在一九四○年，毛主席就曾指出：“在无产阶级领导下的新民主主义共和国的国营经济是社会主义的性质，是整个国民经济的领导力量”（见新民主主义论）。共同纲领第二十八条也规定了：“国营经济为社会主义性质的经济”。共同纲领还规定工业建设的总方针，“应以有计划有步骤地恢复和发展重工业为重点……以创立国家工业化的基础……”。这是新民主主义国家对于国营经济的要求，即对于基本建设的要求。然而，我们的基础或条件却存在着与此要求相反的因素，这就是：第一、旧中国的国家经济的殖民地半殖民地性质及由此必然产生的落后性、分散性和盲目性，恰恰与我们所要建设的社会主义性质的计划性的国家经济相矛盾。第二、现时从事基本建设工作的人员，包括技术人员和管理人员，主要是来自旧社会的，他们沾染着浓厚的资产阶级思想；而参加建筑工程和部分定货的，还有许多私人资本所经营的企业。他们有严重的盲目性以及投机性，与国家的需要经常发生矛盾。第三、我们的许多领导干部，还缺乏大规模基本建设的经验，许多人带着不同程度的农村的和供给制的观点和作风，这种观点和作风与国家建设的新任务也是有矛盾的。因此，在过去基本建设的一系列工作中，无论在计划、设计、施工和资金运用等方面，都不可避免地会发生各种偏差。
    同时，经验还证明，要做好工业基本建设工作，不但必须掌握资源情况，满足必需的技术和机械装备，统一建筑材料的规格和设计的标准；而且要有上下密切衔接的工作组织和分工，制定各项工作的制度工作程序等等。如果不具备这些，那末，任何工程的设计和施工，都必然无从着手，或者效果不好，或者根本失败。
    当然，一切条件都是由人创造出来的，它是随着人们的工作而不断发生变化的。因此，从事基本建设工作的一切人员，如何掌握基本建设的新民主主义的方针，掌握已有的条件，使其发挥最大的效果，并不断克服困难，以创造新的条件，乃是基本建设工作成败的关键。
    （二）
    三年来的基本建设工作，虽然有不小的成就，但从基本建设计划执行的结果来看，情况并不很好。以关内重工业为例，一九五一年关内重工业建设单位共六十一个，其中四十七个是在一九五一年开始的，十四个是一九五○年的结转工程。六十一个建设单位在一九五一年完成的工作总量，仅为计划总量的百分之六十，其中完成率最高者为百分之七十五，最低者为百分之三十七。上述十四个结转单位，本应在一九五○年完成全部计划，但到一九五一年终，只有一个单位完成了计划。而六十一个单位在一九五一年完成的工作总量，也并不是已经全部投入生产或使用了的。
    计划未能完成的原因，不少同志曾分别归纳为以下各点，即：国家拨款迟缓或不及时，物资供应不及时，技术人员不足，缺乏设计和施工的人力，领导干部不懂技术，缺乏工作经验等等。他们由此得出结论，认为现在还不能实行“基本建设工作暂行办法”。
    这种看法对不对呢？显然是不对的。拨款迟缓、缺乏干部等等确是事实，但根本问题并不在这里。上述两年不能完成计划的那些单位的情况，就不是拨款迟所可解释的，当然也不是技术人员缺乏所能够解释的，因为既然技术人员缺乏，为什么却不分缓急地争先要办很多事情呢？这分明是指导思想有错误，以致计划不切实际。譬如太原钢铁厂，一九五○年曾花费数百亿元兴建修造部的厂房，完成后，部分厂房因非急需而改变了使用计划，部分厂房没有机器。该厂开采定襄铁矿，两年间花费百余亿元，终于因为上部铁矿已经采空而被迫停工。再如，西北铁路干线工程局，一九五○年改定较原任务大十六倍的计划，只完成了百分之二十九。大同矿务局在没有机器和技术人员的条件下，竟以六十三亿元修建了厂房。诸如此类的事例，都反映了基本建设中的盲目性。产生这种盲目性的根源，显然是在于我们的不少同志有着不切实际的急躁情绪和本位观点。而过去的事实证明，负责建设的单位无例外的是喜欢提出庞大的计划和大量要钱，草拟计划的人员，只根据笼统的任务来提出计划。上级机关的若干人员，也有多给钱多办事的急于求功的情绪，上下相合就出现了计划不切实际的结果。这和“有计划、有步骤，有重点”的建设方针当然是不相容的。因此，检查过去计划不能完成的原因，应当首先检查制定计划的指导思想，而后再检查保证计划的各种条件。
    在执行计划中，存在另一种有害的指导思想，就是以为有了钱别的都不成问题了。这种思想的主要表现，是对设计工作的错误看法。有许多人过去普遍地不重视设计，特别是不重视设计之前的调查工作。许多工程，只在草草设计之后，就开始施工，一面施工一面设计的情形极为普遍。他们以为这样办可以快些，但结果适得其反。设计既不完整，必然不断改变或顾此失彼，于是停工待图、停工待料等现象都随之而产生，计划不能完成，也就成为普遍的现象了。这显然是违反基本建设的客观规律的。
    虽然也有许多计划是完成了，但其中也存在严重的问题。首先是，工程设计错误甚多。譬如：天兰铁路一线的拱桥，有很多因基础下沉而发生裂缝，不得不加以补救；经纬纺织机器制造厂的主要厂房，施工尚未完成，已有很多柱子不平衡地下沉五分至六吋，梁和柱也因之发生裂纹，不得不施行补救。太原钢铁厂的汾河水坝，事先没有弄清流速和含沙量，加以施工不良，修竣后即被水冲毁。还有一些设计只讲求形式和外观而不切实用，如太原钢铁厂的所谓“玻璃房子”，冬冷夏热操作困难，屋顶已经漏雨。至于施工中的浪费现象更是严重的。过去有许多工程是由私营营造商或把头承包的，某些公营营造公司，也是徒具其名而被私商所把持，因之偷工减料的现象无处不有，若干工程人员和管理人员则和私商勾结共同作弊，大量盗窃国家财产，工程质量普遍地遭受损害。这种情况也同时妨碍着计划的完成。在宿舍建设中的浪费和不适当的现象更引起了广大工人的不满。如太原钢铁厂在一九五○年用宿舍投资的三分之一，建设了一○八户“乙种宿舍”，标准太高和需要不相称，不少高级职员因花费太大不愿租住，而四分之三的工人的住宅问题无法解决。大同矿务局为职员建筑的宿舍，工人称之为“皇宫”，许多工人的住宅条件却毫无改善。在宿舍和其他附属建设上的铺张浪费现象的普遍，是相当惊人的。
　　这一切都证明，若干干部对基本建设的指导思想是片面的。他们放松甚或放弃了两条路线的斗争。他们对于未经改造的充满资产阶级思想观点的某些旧技术人员，采取了盲目信任的态度，对他们的错误设计不加干涉，对于群众的意见也不加以重视，把技术神秘化因而也不亲自掌握与审查设计中的重要关键，结果就任凭技术人员为所欲为，他们有的竟“以国家企业与投资，作为个人沽名钓誉的试验场”（太原钢铁厂职工评某工程师语）。过去对于私营营造商在施工中的盗窃活动，也不是一无所知的。在抽查的几个厂矿中，都发现工人群众和包工的斗争，而领导方面却没有积极地组织群众对包工者实行监督，他们惟恐“管的太紧了，工程包不出去”。这种对待资本家的妥协态度所换得的结果，只是不法资本家肆无忌惮的侵蚀和盗窃，不少立场不稳的干部，在这种侵蚀之下陷入了贪污的泥坑，这个教训是惨痛的。从领导干部的思想根源上说，这是由于我们放弃了工人阶级的领导权，放弃了必要斗争的结果。
    此外，过去有些错误的造成，还因为主持基本建设工作的机关和干部不请示报告。上述太原钢铁厂的修造部工程即系不经批准而施工的；前中央钢铁工业局副局长陆达又为该厂假造了五○三亿元的工程决算。这种违纪行为是受了不顾全局的本位观点所支配的。“三反”“五反”以后，这种情况已有改变，但在将来的大规模的建设工作中，我们还必须彻底克服这些错误。
    （三）
    为了彻底克服我们过去在基本建设工作中所犯的错误，为了掌握两条路线的斗争，并取得斗争的胜利，为了使基本建设的每一工作步骤，都能符合于客观的要求，为了更好地创造各种条件，以满足基本建设的需要，我们今后必须贯彻执行中央财政经济委员会颁发的“基本建设工作暂行办法”。“基本建设工作暂行办法”的三十六项条文，以工业建设为主体，阐明了我们国家进行基本建设的基本规律，保证了基本建设的程序能够顺利推行。
　　办法以第三节——设计工作为中心，阐述了进行基本建设的基本原则和工程本身的要求。第九条和第十条中规定了：“在施工以前必须依照本办法所规定的设计工作步骤与内容完成必需的设计文件，否则不得施工”；“计划任务书之提出必须符合于国家建设的方针与任务及国家长期建设计划之规定”。这两项是必须遵守的基本原则。
　　对于一切基本建设，首先要求有计划任务书。它的内容应依据下列几项来规定，这就是：（一）产品的种类及其在国民经济中的重要性；（二）生产规模及其发展远景；（三）建设地点及与有关工业的关系；（四）建设期限及与有关工业的配合；（五）投资估计数及所需外汇数目；（六）资源与经济条件，包括原材料供应与产品销路。在制定计划任务书时，“可以同时提出几个方案，并具体比较其利弊”。这样就可以避免全部计划的盲目性。其次，一切基本建设的“初步设计”，要求其“阐明设计对象在技术上的可能性与经济上的合理性”，这是解决“需要”与“可能”相结合的具体步骤。为此目的，必须进行必要的调查研究，以满足办法中所规定的要求。其三是“技术设计”，这是基本建设的最基本的文件，是“初步设计中一切规定及技术问题的明确化与具体化”，在办法中对技术设计规定了十项要求，并确定每项都要有必要的文件及图纸，并根据技术设计作出各项费用的详细预算。最后，要依照技术设计制出供给施工时所必需的详细图样。一切基本建设都必须依次进行这四个步骤，才能保证基本建设符合于国家的整个建设方针，才能保证工程的顺利完成。这些步骤及其内容的规定，是基本建设的客观要求，而不是按照别的什么主观的想像所制定的。
　　为了实现基本建设的计划性，“基本建设工作暂行办法”强调了集中管理的精神。离开集中管理，计划性是不可能实现的。为此，办法规定了以下各项原则：区分建设单位为“限额以上”和“限额以下”两种及甲、乙、丙、丁四类和各类企业的具体投资额；规定了以中央为主的对于设计文件的审核及批准程序；规定各项设计文件批准后，建设单位不得擅自变更的原则；规定财务预算和基本建设计划的编制、审核和批准系统及自上而下的颁发控制数字和编制计划草案的程序，并指定专业银行按照计划监督拨款；规定执行基本建设计划的定期报告制度与检查制度、分级负责的工程验收制度及规定统一的计划表格等。这些规定的贯彻实施，就将克服过去在基本建设工作中效率不高及分散和混乱的状态。
　　“基本建设工作暂行办法”指出，各级主管基本建设的部门及“基本建设单位同时已在进行生产者”，都应设立基本建设的专责机构，负责领导或进行基本建设的设计、施工、计划等工作；并要求中央各主管部门或管理总局，根据需要与可能，逐渐成立独立的设计公司及建筑安装包工公司。这几项规定，是保证基本建设工作的另一重要条件，没有强有力的基本建设的专责机构和国家的设计与施工部门，是不能保证基本建设任务的完成的。中央主管各部，“于设计机构健全或条件成熟时，应尽可能编制各种标准设计，颁发所属各部门采用，借以节省设计人员力量与设计费用”。同时应“就各建设单位之工程决算，核计其工料费用……作出使用材料与劳动力等的定额纪录……以为积累经验逐渐改进定额之参考”。此外，设计公司与建筑安装包工公司应采用合同制与经济核算制；在进行设计工作时，应注意节约，力避铺张浪费；施工时应力避积存款项及材料、呆置资金及停工待料等不良现象，避免浪费工料及粗制滥造。这些规定无疑地都是十分必要的。
    综观“基本建设工作暂行办法”的各种规定，可以看出，这个办法是和基本建设中过去已经发生与今后仍然可能发生的各种错误倾向进行斗争的重要武器。如何掌握运用和发挥这个武器的力量，是每一个从事基本建设工作的干部首先是各级领导干部当前最重要的任务。
    （四）
　　彻底执行“基本建设工作暂行办法”，必然使我国的基本建设逐步走向正轨。新民主主义的国营经济即社会主义性质的经济的特点之一，是它的高度的计划性。和资本主义经济的盲目发展相区别，在新民主主义国家，任何重要建设，都不能离开国家的计划。因此，“基本建设工作暂行办法”，特别强调了对于计划性的要求。但是，如果没有以中央为首的集中领导和管理，计划性的实现是不可能的。因此，这个办法同时强调了集中性。加强基本建设工作的计划性和集中性，这就是“基本建设工作暂行办法”的基本精神。强调计划性和集中性的目的，不但是为了使得重要的建设工程“符合于国家一定时期的政治、经济总任务及国家的长期建设计划”，而且是为了掌握建设对象在技术上的可能性和经济上的合理性，以保证工程质量和避免浪费，达到又快又好又省的目的。
　　“基本建设工作暂行办法”颁布以后，已经得到了各级领导干部和多数工作人员的拥护。他们正在为其贯彻执行而努力。但也还有若干同志，对这个办法抱着消极怀疑的态度。有些人是消极等待，不去积极地创造迅速发展基本建设事业的条件。他们害怕违反上级的规定，怕犯错误，藉口“宁肯少些，但要好些”，实际是消极怠工。另一种人认为这个办法要求太高，规定太严，很难行得通。他们说：既然要搞基本建设，就免不了浪费。这两种思想，实质上都是认为“基本建设工作暂行办法”不切合实际，没有实现的可能。如果放任这些思想发展下去，我们国家的基本建设计划，便将无法实现。这一部分有错误思想的从事基本建设工作的干部和工作人员，对“基本建设工作暂行办法”的精神认识不够，不能正确地理解“又快、又好、又省”的意义，而是把它分割开来了。
    我们知道，从事基本建设工作的每一个同志，在主观上都是想“快”的。他们以为“快”的主要标志是各个独立工程的迅速开工。他们认为中国的工业太少了，办什么都有用，因此应该尽可能地多办快办，而不必在计划上多费工夫。“基本建设工作暂行办法”纠正了这种错误，但有些同志却又产生了另一种错误思想，他们认为要执行“基本建设工作暂行办法”，就只好慢慢来，只求好，不求快，宁可少办，不愿多办。这种现象也是值得重视的。有以上两种错误思想的同志，通常都是把“快、好、省”对立起来的。他们认为要快就不能好，就不能省；要好就只有多花钱和慢慢来；要省，就只好办得坏一点。那么，应当怎样认识“快、好、省”的原则呢？“快、好、省”是一个原则的三个方面，抛开任何一个方面都是不对的。只强调快而不顾质量和节约，会造成大量返工，当然不能快了。多少事实已经证明了这一点。只强调好和省而不管快，会使国家基本建设计划不能实现。只有把三者统一起来，作到又快，又好，又省，这才是正确的指导方针，这是我们进行基本建设工作应当树立的基本思想。
　　所谓“快”，不但是指一个工程的建设进度快，而且首先是指国家的建设快。由此可以理解，每一个重要的工程，必须符合国家的建设计划，否则，尽管很快地建设起来了，但因占用了不该用的钱，恰恰是迟缓了国家的建设。所谓“好”，不但是指建筑工程或机械装备本身的质量好，而且还必须是合乎使用，合乎客观需要。那种只重形式美观而不顾实用的作法，是决不可取的。所谓“省”，不但是要求每一项工程的设计和施工，应进行精打细算，节省人力、物力和财力，而且还应当掌握陈云同志在一九五○年二月全国财政会议上的报告中所提出的原则，“浪费是严重的错误。我们财经工作人员，不应该是说贪污不贪污的问题，那是旧中国的标准，而我们的标准非但是不能贪污，而且是物资用得恰当与否的问题，所谓恰当，是：迟用、早用、多用、少用、先用、后用、缓用、急用的问题，要用之恰当才能不浪费。”这就是我们对于“又快又好又省”应有的理解，不这样理解，是要犯错误的。
    反映在基本建设工作中的两条路线的斗争，今后仍然会继续进行下去，因为资产阶级的思想观点，在我们的队伍中特别是在工程技术人员内还大量存在；这就不可避免地对我们发生各种影响。因此，主动地掌握两条路线的斗争，并取得斗争的胜利，是能否作好基本建设工作的关键，也是贯彻执行“基本建设工作暂行办法”的关键。
