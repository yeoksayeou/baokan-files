Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: According to TASS, workers in all industries across the Soviet Union are enthusiastically launching socialist production emulation to greet the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).

	In the machine manufacturing industry, workers are enthusiastically participating in socialist emulation. The entire staff of the "Elektrosila" Electric Equipment Factory in Leningrad recently sent an open letter to the workers of various enterprises in the city and region of Leningrad, calling on them to launch a production emulation to greet the Party Congress. In their letter, they pledged to adopt more than a thousand labor-saving rationalization proposals, save the state millions of rubles, produce millions of rubles worth of products beyond the plan, and manufacture the first hydro-generator for one of the largest construction projects of the Fifth Five-Year Plan—the Gorky Hydroelectric Station. Many workers at the Minsk Machine Tool Factory have recently been regularly exceeding their daily work quotas by as much as 100% to 150%. The staff of the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant also put forward high pledges, deciding to produce thousands of tons of steel beyond the plan before the opening of the Party Congress, manufacture an automated mobile excavator with a fourteen-cubic-meter bucket for the South Ukraine Canal ahead of schedule, and manufacture two powerful rock crushers for the Kuibyshev and Kakhovka Hydroelectric Stations.

	In the automobile manufacturing industry, the staff of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory pledged to complete the nine-month production plan before September 25th and to produce products worth 30 million rubles in excess of the plan. The staff of the Minsk Automobile Factory also launched a production emulation, pledging to adopt various rationalization proposals and inventions to save six million rubles before the opening of the Congress.

	Tens of thousands of oil workers have participated in the Stakhanovite work shifts to greet the Party Congress. Many oil trusts have completed their eight-month plans ahead of schedule. The eight-month plan of the oil workers in the Tatar Autonomous Republic has been overfulfilled. The staff of the Ninth Oil Field of the Baku Ordzhonikidze Oil Trust has completed the nine-month oil production plan ahead of schedule, increasing labor productivity by approximately 12% and saving the state approximately two million rubles; they also pledged to complete the annual production plan before the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution. The work teams of the Tuimazy Oil Trust in Bashkir pledged to extract tens of thousands of tons of oil beyond the plan before the Party Congress.

	The production emulation of coal miners has also achieved remarkable results. The team of Berezhko, a combined coal mining machine operator in the Donets Basin, has been completing two and a half quotas per shift since the launch of the emulation. The team of Lyashenko, a coal cutting machine operator at the Zhdanov Coal Mine in Karaganda, has already completed thirteen months' worth of quotas. Hardware workers in various regions have also enthusiastically launched production emulations. For example, Pan Chenko, Rotychev, and Khudiakov, famous steelworkers in the Urals, have all pledged to produce 500 tons of steel more than the September plan. Hardware workers in Taganrog pledged to increase labor productivity by 5% beyond the plan and save 1.5 million rubles in production costs.

	In order to greet the convening of the Party Congress, Soviet textile workers also put forward production pledges. Workers at the Tashkent Textile Factory pledged to increase the production of high-quality products worth nine million rubles in excess of the plan before the opening of the Congress. The team of Akhunov, a deputy foreman at the Fergana Textile Factory, pledged to produce 90,000 meters of textiles beyond the plan by the end of the year. In addition, construction workers, food workers, railway workers, and timber industry workers in various regions are striving to greet the 19th Party Congress with new labor achievements.
