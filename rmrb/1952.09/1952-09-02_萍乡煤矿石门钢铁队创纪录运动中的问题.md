Problems in the Record-Breaking Movement of the Steel Team at the Shimen Coal Mine in Pingxiang
    Liu Kai
    The Shimen Steel Team of the Wangjiayuan Mine under the Pingxiang Mining Bureau had made some improvements in blasting and drilling techniques, and adopted advanced deep-hole operations. In particular, the team's workers studied the properties of various rocks and the performance and power of various explosives, and were able to determine the amount of drilling and charging and the order of blasting according to the changes in the rocks. Therefore, they had created some new tunneling records. In terms of labor organization, the Shimen Steel Team once used a two-tunnel cyclic operation method; although their cyclic operation was not formal enough due to the lack of technical leadership, it still played a positive role.
    However, because the leading cadres of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau and the Wangjiayuan Mine lacked political and technical leadership for the Shimen Steel Team, the Shimen Steel Team had serious shortcomings in the process of creating new records. These shortcomings are manifested in many aspects:
    The new records of the Shimen Steel Team have not been consolidated, and their daily production records are far from the new national records they have created. The highest record of the Steel Team in April this year was 30.5 meters per day, but in early June this year, the team was still frequently stuck between 6 and 8 meters per day. When creating new records, one roadway could advance four to five cycles per day and night, while normally it could only advance about one cycle. The Steel Team's plan to advance 300 meters per month was not completed from January to April this year. The reason for the above phenomenon is mainly that their creation of new records only relied on a burst of workers' labor enthusiasm, without seriously summarizing the workers' labor enthusiasm and work methods, and implementing them into daily work. The most prominent example is that on April 29 this year, everyone put in extra effort to create a new record of 30.5 meters advanced per day and night. The next day, everyone breathed a sigh of relief and repaired the unstowed supports, and the whole day passed without advancing an inch.
    Because of the use of blitzkrieg methods, there is also a widespread phenomenon of extending working hours. According to Zhang Shunan, director of Wangjiayuan Mine, on average, each person extended their working hours by about three to four hours when creating new records. If calculated by the average overtime of four hours per person, their new record is not a certain number of meters advanced in 24 hours, but actually a certain number of meters advanced in one and a half days, 36 hours (calculated in working hours).
    Because the leadership had the idea of creating records for the sake of creating records, there was also a disguised increase in the labor force. Usually, the timber for erecting supports is transported by the workers themselves to the material section in the mine, but when creating new records, the administrative side finds other workers to send it to the working face. The same is true for pushing carts to remove debris. Usually, workers push the carts to the岔道, that is to say, at least 100 to 150 meters away, while when creating new records, they only need to push them 10 meters away. The other section is pushed by someone else.
    The phenomenon of disregarding engineering specifications when creating new records is also very serious. According to regulations and daily practice, supports are erected every 7 or 8 centimeters. When the Shimen Steel Team creates new records, supports are erected every 1.7 or 8 meters or more, and the supports that are erected less are erected again the next day. When creating new records, sometimes the帮 are not brushed, and the bottom is not cleaned up, and the engineering specifications are very rough.
    There are also false phenomena in the calculation of work achievements by the Shimen Steel Team. The Steel Team's cyclic operation is limited to two tunnels. When there are three or four roadways, they use single-tunnel tunneling in the other one or two tunnels. For example, on November 24 last year, the so-called new national record of 20.03 meters per day advanced in the stone roadway by the Steel Team was calculated by adding up the progress of two single-tunnel roadways in one day and night (one 10.3 meters, one 10 meters), but the leadership claimed that it was "created under the multi-tunnel cyclic tunneling method." The so-called new national record of more than 37 meters of tunneling in one day and night on May 25 this year was also the result of workers adding up the work done in two days.
    Because the Shimen Steel Team does have some achievements, the leadership consciously wanted to cultivate this team into an advanced team. However, from the above examples, it can be seen that their cultivation method is wrong. They are only obsessed with the name of the new record, and even do not hesitate to falsely report achievements and pretend to be national records. Under the control of this idea, the work they have done for the Shimen Steel Team is mainly welcoming, wearing flowers, commending, rewarding, and holding celebration meetings and general calls for mobilization, etc. The real political and ideological leadership and technical leadership are very insufficient. I talked to many workers in the Steel Team and found that many workers have a vague understanding of the significance of creating new records; some workers can also say that creating new records is good for individuals and the country, but their understanding is not very profound; some people even simply think that creating new records is for "winning awards," "personal glory," or not being convinced by others. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau and the Wangjiayuan Mine's leadership did not pay enough attention to the workers' ideological situation, and even took an unprincipled attitude towards the workers' wrong ideas. For example, at the end of last year, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry issued instructions requiring that attention must be paid to engineering specifications and safety in the labor competition. When Gao Zisheng, chief of the Wangjiayuan Mine's coal mining section, conveyed this instruction to the Steel Team, some workers were dissatisfied, saying, "Who would dare to create new records if this is the case!" They believed that demanding "high" was "suppressing" new records. Gao Zisheng did not explain or educate the workers, nor did he implement the instructions of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau's leadership's technical leadership of the Steel Team was also very insufficient. When workers create new records, the leadership mostly only asks if there are any difficulties and helps organize the strength, but does not often go deep into the pits to seriously understand and solve the problems in production. Technical personnel rarely go down the well for specific technical guidance. Therefore, the leadership does not fully understand the real situation of the operation methods, engineering specifications, safety, and technical operations when creating new records. After the new record is created, the leadership rarely conducts strict technical review from the technical aspect, nor does it conduct technical measurement and convene relevant workers for discussion, and often only makes a conclusion easily based on the verbal report of individual workers.
    These situations show that the leadership departments of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau and the Wangjiayuan Mine urgently need to correct their leadership ideas and strengthen the leadership of the movement to create new records.

    萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队创纪录运动中的问题
    刘　凯
    萍乡矿务局王家源矿的石门钢铁队在放炮、打眼的技术方面曾有一些改进，并采用了先进的深孔作业方法，特别是该队工人研究了各种岩石的性质和各种炸药的性能与威力，能根据岩石变化的情况，决定打眼装药的多少和放炮的先后，因而他们曾创造出一些掘进新纪录。在劳动组织方面，石门钢铁队曾经运用了两个孔道的循环作业方法；虽然由于缺乏技术领导，他们的循环作业还不够正规，但还是起了积极的作用。
    但是，由于萍乡矿务局和王家源矿的领导干部对石门钢铁队缺乏政治领导和技术领导，以致石门钢铁队在创造新纪录过程中存在着严重的缺点，这些缺点表现在很多方面：
    石门钢铁队的新纪录没有巩固下来，他们的日常生产纪录和他们创造的全国新纪录相距太远。钢铁队今年四月份的最高纪录是日进三十点五公尺，而今年六月初，这个队还经常停留在日进六公尺至八公尺之间。创造新纪录时一个巷道一日夜可以进四个到五个循环，而平常却只能进一个循环左右。钢铁队月进三百公尺的计划，今年一至四月份都没有完成。产生以上现象的原因，主要是他们创造新纪录只是靠工人劳动热情突击一阵算数，而没有把工人的劳动热情和作业方式认真总结，并贯彻到日常工作中去。最突出的例子是今年四月二十九日，大家加了一股劲创了一日夜进三十点五公尺的新纪录。第二天大家松了一口气，补补没架的棚子，一天就过去了，这一天一尺也没有进。
    由于采用突击的办法，因而也就普遍地存在延长工作时间的现象。据王家源矿矿长张树楠谈，平均起来创造新纪录时每人延长工作时间约三至四小时。如若以每人普遍加班四小时计算，他们的新纪录就不是二十四小时进若干公尺，实际上是一日半三十六小时（从工时上算）进若干公尺了。
    由于领导上有为创新纪录而创纪录的思想，因而也产生了变相地增加劳动力的现象。平常工作时，架棚子的木料，都是由工人自己到井下材料股去运，在创造新纪录时则由行政方面找别的工人送到工作面上去。推车出碴子也是这样。平常工人都是把车子推到岔道上去，也就是说最少要推一百至一百五十公尺远，而创造新纪录时只要推出十公尺远就可以了。另一段路则由别的人代推。
    创造新纪录时不顾工程规格的现象也很严重。按照规定和日常的作法，都是每隔七、八公寸架棚子
    一架。石门钢铁队创造新纪录时则每隔一公尺七、八或两公尺多才架棚子一架，少架的棚子在次日上班时再补架。在创新纪录时有时帮也不刷，底也没有起净，工程规格十分毛草。
    石门钢铁队在计算工作成绩中也有虚假现象。钢铁队的循环作业，只限于两个孔道。在三个或四个巷道时，他们在另外的一个或两个孔道则用单孔道掘进。如去年十一月二十四日，钢铁队在石巷掘进日进二十点零三公尺的所谓全国新纪录，就是把两个单孔道掘进一昼夜的进度（一个十点三公尺，一个十公尺）加起来算的，但领导方面却宣称“是在多孔循环掘进方法下创造的”。今年五月二十五日的所谓一昼夜掘进三十七公尺多的全国新纪录，也是工人们把两天作的工作加起来的。
    由于石门钢铁队的确也有某些成绩，因此领导方面曾有意识地想培养这个队成为一个先进的队。但是，从上面的例子可以看出，他们的培养方法是错误的，他们只迷恋于新纪录这个名词，甚至不惜假报成绩，冒充全国纪录。在这种思想支配下，他们对石门钢铁队所做的工作主要是欢迎、戴花、表扬、奖励以及开庆祝会座谈会和一般的号召鼓动等等，真正的政治思想领导和技术领导是很不够的。我和钢铁队的许多工人谈了话，发现不少工人对于创新纪录的意义是模糊的；有的工人也能说创新纪录对个人对国家都有好处，但了解的还极不深刻；有的人甚至还只简单地认为创新纪录是为了“得奖”、“个人光荣”，或者是不服气别人。对于工人的思想情况，萍乡矿务局和王家源矿的领导方面是注意不够的，甚至对工人的错误思想采取无原则迁就的态度。例如去年年底中央燃料工业部曾发出指示，要求在劳动竞赛中一定要注意工程规格和保安。王家源矿采煤股长高梓升向钢铁队传达这一指示时，有的工人就不满意，说“这样谁还敢创新纪录呀！”认为要求得“高”是“打击”、“压制”新纪录。高梓升竟然不向工人进行解释教育，也不执行燃料工业部的指示。萍乡矿务局领导方面对钢铁队的技术领导也是很不够的。工人创新纪录时，领导方面大多是只问问有无困难，帮助组织一下力量，而没有经常深入坑井，认真了解并解决生产中的问题。技术人员也很少下井进行具体的技术指导。因而，领导方面对于创造新纪录时的作业方式、工程规格，保安和技术操作等真实情况就不完全了解。新纪录创造出来了，领导方面很少从技术方面进行严格的审查，也不进行技术测定和召集有关工人进行讨论，经常只根据个别工人的口头汇报，就轻易做出总结。
    这些情况，说明萍乡矿务局和王家源矿的领导部门，亟需端正领导思想，加强对创造新纪录运动的领导。
