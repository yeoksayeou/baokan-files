    Xie Wanfu Carpentry Team Learns to Operate Machines
    To the Editor: The Xie Wanfu Carpentry Team of the Harbin Engineering Office of the Construction Engineering Company of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government originally engaged in handicraft production. In order to meet the needs of basic construction work, they were transferred to a mechanized woodworking factory in late June. All the workers in the team accepted this arduous and glorious task with full confidence. They unanimously expressed that they would study technology diligently and create more wealth for the country. After arriving at the woodworking factory, every worker learned from the technicians with an open mind. Therefore, they quickly learned to operate the machines. In fifty days, they改造了四种机器，并提高了机器的效能。

    Zhou Wenyu of the team transformed the universal machine, which could only produce tenon cuts, cut materials, and pull shoulders, into one that could make five kinds of products, such as countersinking and chamfering, doubling production efficiency. Cui Lianrun, Shen Qinghua, and others modified the cutters and iron baffles that used to cut tenons and rabbets, reducing one operating procedure. Mei Xingqun installed cutters on both sides of the outlet of the press for pressing standard materials, eliminating the process of cutting tenons and chamfering after pressing standard materials, which used to require two operations. In addition to ensuring quality, it also increased work efficiency by two times. Zhang Jinshan removed the iron baffle in the middle of the hand electric planer that was operated on one side and installed a wooden baffle that was smooth on both sides. This made it a hand electric planer that could be operated on both sides, and the machine efficiency exceeded the previous level by one time.

    The above four improvements created a wealth equivalent to 471.49 tons of grain for the country, completing 198.5% of the annual increase in production and savings plan, and also increased the number of first-class products and reduced the number of third-class products. Yuan Bojun

    谢万福木工小组学会了操纵机器
    编辑同志：东北人民政府工业部建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处谢万福木工小组，原来从事手工业生产，为了基本建设工作的需要，六月下旬被调到机械化的木工厂工作，全组工友满怀信心地接受了这个艰巨而光荣的任务，他们并一致表示好好钻研技术，为国家创造更多的财富。到木工厂以后，每个工友都是虚心地向技术人员学习，因此，很快地就学会了操纵机器，在五十天当中他们改造了四种机器，并提高了机器的效能。
    该组周文玉把原来只能做裁口、截料、拉肩生产品的万能机，改造成能做倒铆、倒楞等五样生产品了，生产效率提高一倍。崔连润、沈庆华等把过去裁口裁灰口的刀刃子和铁挡板加以改装，减少了一道操作程序。梅兴群把压规格料的压机，在出料口两侧各按上刀刃子，把过去压完规格料后，再经过二道作业才能裁口倒楞的工序减去了，除保证了质量外，还提高工作效率二倍。张金山把一面操作的手电刨中间的铁档板去掉，按上一个两面净光的木档板，这样就成为两面操作的手电刨了，机器效能比从前超过一倍。
    以上四种改进，为国家创造了四百七十一点四九吨粮食的财富，完成全年增产节约计划百分之一百九十八点五，同时还增加了一级品，减少了三级品。  袁伯钧
