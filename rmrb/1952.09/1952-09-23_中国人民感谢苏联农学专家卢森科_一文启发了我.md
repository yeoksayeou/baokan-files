    The Article "The Chinese People Thank Soviet Agronomy Expert Lysenko" Inspired Me
    To the Editor: I am an agricultural production worker. The article "The Chinese People Thank Soviet Agronomy Expert Lysenko" published in the newspaper greatly inspired me. Comrade Lysenko pointed out that "there is unlimited potential in China's agricultural production," first of all because "China still has a lot of land lying idle." Indeed, my hometown, Shuyang County in Jiangsu Province, has patches of wasteland. Taking Yuantan Township as an example, in addition to the more than 200 mu of reclaimed land, there are still more than 700 mu of wasteland, accounting for about 5% of the township's arable land. Jiangsu is a densely populated province with a shortage of land in our country, yet there is still a lot of wasteland, so one can imagine the situation in other regions. Comrade Lysenko also pointed out that "China wastes a lot of fertilizer" and "many places burn livestock manure as fuel." My hometown does not pay attention to making fertilizer. Raising pigs is only for "collecting small change into big money" and "earning some food scraps." Moreover, livestock manure is often burned as fuel, which is such a waste! Comrade Lysenko reminds us that "Chinese agricultural technicians should create a new set of Chinese agricultural techniques." Comrade Lysenko's great internationalist spirit encourages me. I am confident that I will work with agricultural production workers across the country to learn advanced Soviet agricultural knowledge and technology, and help the vast number of farmers to strive together to improve our country's agricultural production.

### “中国人民感谢苏联农学专家卢森科”一文启发了我

    “中国人民感谢苏联农学专家卢森科”一文启发了我
    编辑同志：我是个农业生产工作者。报上登的“中国人民感谢苏联农学专家卢森科”一文，对我有很大的启发。卢森科同志指出：“中国农业生产存在着无限的潜在力”，首先是“中国现在还有许多土地闲着”。的确，我的家乡江苏沭阳县就有一片片的荒田，单以袁滩乡为例，除了已开荒二百多亩田外，还有七百多亩荒田，占全乡可耕田亩百分之五左右。江苏是我国人烟稠密、土地缺乏的省份，尚且还有不少荒田，其他地区就可想而知了。卢森科同志又指出：“中国浪费了很多肥料”，“很多地方把牲畜的粪便当做燃料烧掉了”。我的家乡就不重视制造肥料，养猪只是为了把“零钱聚成整钱”“赚些饭水”；而且常常把牲畜粪当燃料烧了，这多么可惜！卢森科同志提醒我们“中国的农业技术人员，应该创造一套新的中国的农业技术”。卢森科同志的伟大国际主义精神鼓舞着我，我有信心和全国农业生产工作者一起，学习苏联的先进农业知识和技术，帮助广大农民共同为提高祖国的农业生产而奋斗。  善庭
