    IV. After returning home, Wang Shugui sat on his newly distributed land and thought for a long time: "It's been two years since liberation. Rent reduction, anti-hegemony, land distribution—Chairman Mao is thinking about us all the time, and the People's Government has never been wrong."
    V. In the spring, the county farm invited many experienced farmers to hold a production meeting, and Wang Shugui was also invited to participate. The farm comrades introduced their experience in increasing production in detail at the meeting, and let everyone visit the farm's farming methods on the spot. Wang Shugui then believed that the farm's high rice yield was real. He discussed it with several young people at the time and proposed to the farm to guarantee the creation of a record of 1,000 catties of rice per mu.
    VI. When Wang Shugui proposed the "Thousand Catty Plan" at a family meeting, the whole family shook their heads in dismay. His father said, "I have worked in the fields for more than sixty years, and I dare not speak big words. One mu of rice paddy yields three stones and eight, and can't be harvested more!"

    四、回家后，王树桂坐在自己新分得的田地上想了好久：“解放两年了，减租、反霸、分田，毛主席的心整天在为我们打算，人民政府说的话从来没有错过。”
    五、春天，县农场请了许多有生产经验的农民，开了一次生产会议，王树桂也被邀参加。农场工作同志在会上详细介绍了他们的增产经验，并让大家实地参观了农场的耕作办法。王树桂才相信农场水稻的丰产是真的。他当时同几个青年人商量了一下，就向农场提出保证创造每亩收水稻一千斤的纪录。
    六、王树桂在家庭会议上提出“千斤计划”时，全家都摇头咋舌。他父亲说：“我在田里干了六十多年，也不敢讲句大话。一亩稻田三石八，再不能多收！”
