    Shanghai Railway Administration's freight volume has been continuously increasing since June, reflecting the expanding and deepening of material exchange between urban and rural areas in East China. Taking May as the base, freight volume increased by 17 percent in June and 40 percent in July; compared with last year, June exceeded the same period last year by 2.2 percent, and July exceeded the same period last year by 15 percent. The transportation volume in July has exceeded the peak season transportation volume of last year by 3 percent.
    The railway transportation situation in recent months also shows that the material exchange between urban and rural areas in East China has expanded from top to bottom and from point to area. This is mainly reflected in the general increase in the number of loaded cars and short-distance freight at many small stations. Even small stations that have never had freight business now have freight. For example, Tianfu'an Station, a fourth-class small station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, has never had freight loaded or unloaded here since the railway was built. However, in July of this year, nine cars of hairy pigs were loaded and shipped from here. Similar situations can be found in many places.
    The increase in railway freight volume is, on the one hand, due to the increasingly active urban and rural exchanges; on the other hand, it is also the result of the Railway Administration's efforts to launch the full-load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement and extensively and deeply attract sources of goods. Railway employees have contributed greatly to the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in these movements. Because of the full-load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement, the Shanghai Railway Administration exceeded 18,463.8 ton-kilometers in the second quarter, and the increased transportation capacity is equivalent to 300 more trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Since the launch of the freight solicitation movement in May, more than 6,000 employees in the bureau have participated in the solicitation work. They went deep into various departments in cities and villages to investigate economic conditions, communicate production and sales relationships, and thus greatly promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. For example, Longyou Station cooperated with the state-owned native product company to purchase hairy pigs, and provided various conveniences in terms of loading and transportation, which helped the native product company to complete the purchase task and opened up the sales of hairy pigs. Zhangshu and Xinyu stations helped local wheat sales, inquired about wheat prices in Guangzhou and Shanghai for cargo owners, calculated freight and costs, and determined the sales location. In addition, the Railway Administration also held consignment and transport services and developed refrigerated car services, which promoted the increase in transportation volume.
    In order to welcome the upcoming peak season of material exchange, in addition to continuing the full-load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement and the solicitation of goods, the Shanghai Railway Administration staff have also made other preparations, such as rushing to make new and closer operation schedules; strengthening station operations and promoting Li Xikui's advanced work method; rectifying loading and unloading organizations and shortening loading and unloading time, so as to complete the transportation tasks in the larger-scale material exchanges in the future.

### 上海铁路管理局货运增加

    上海铁路管理局货运增加
    上海铁路管理局货物运输量自六月份以来不断增加，这反映出华东区城乡物资交流正在不断扩大与深入。如以五月份为基数，六月份货物运输量增加百分之十七，七月份增加百分之四十；和去年比较，六月份超过去年同期百分之二点二，七月份超过去年同期百分之十五，其中七月份的运输量已超过去年最旺季节运输量的百分之三。
    从近几个月铁路运输的情况中，也可以看出华东区城乡物资交流已自上而下、由点到面地扩展开去。这主要表现为许多小站装车数和短距离货运的普遍增加，甚至从来没有货运业务的小站，现在也有货运了。如沪宁线上的四等小站——天福庵车站，自有铁路以来，从来没有货物在这里装卸过，今年七月份却有九车毛猪从这里装运出去。类似这样的情况已可以找到很多。
    铁路货物运输量的增加，一方面固然由于城乡交流日趋活跃；另一方面，也是路局展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动和广泛深入地招徕货源的结果。铁路员工们在这些运动中，为城乡物资交流工作贡献出了巨大力量。因为开展了满载、超轴、五百公里运动，上海铁路管理局在第二季度内曾超轴一万八千四百六十三点八吨公里，提高的运输力等于沪宁线上多开三百趟列车。自五月份开展了招徕货源运动之后，全局已有六千多个员工参加了招徕工作。他们深入到城市、农村的各个部门中去，调查经济情况，沟通产销关系，因而大大地促进了城乡物资交流。如龙游车站配合国营土产公司收购毛猪，在装运方面多方予以便利，这样就帮助土产公司完成了收购任务，同时打开了毛猪的销路。樟树、新喻等站帮助当地的小麦推销工作，为货主打听广州、上海的小麦价格，计算运价与成本，决定销地。此外，路局还举办代销包运业务，发展冷藏车业务，这些都促进了运输量的增加。
    为了迎接即将到来的物资交流旺季，上海铁路管理局职工除继续展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动和招徕货源运动外，还做了其他的准备工作，如赶制新的紧密运行图；加强车站作业，推行李锡奎先进工作法；整顿装卸组织，缩短装卸时间等等，以便完成今后更大规模的物资交流中的运输任务。（新华社）
