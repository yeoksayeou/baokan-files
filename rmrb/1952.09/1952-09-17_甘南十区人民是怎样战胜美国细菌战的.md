At 12:10 AM on April 4th, American planes dropped small field mice infected with plague bacillus in Xinmin, Minzhong, Gongyi, and Gongnong four administrative villages of the Tenth District of Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province. The next morning, local residents discovered them one after another and quickly reported to the district, county, province, and Northeast People's Government. Thanks to the emergency measures taken to kill fleas, exterminate rats, and disinfect, as well as the widespread mass patriotic health campaign, the American aggressors' sinister plan to kill our peaceful people with the terrible plague was completely crushed. On July 12th, when Bai Xiqing, Deputy Minister of the Health Department of the Northeast People's Government, reported this situation, the members of the International Scientific Committee praised this miracle.

This is indeed a miracle. However, this miracle was achieved through intense combat and meticulous work.

At 6:00 AM on April 5th, the Health Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government in Qiqihar City received a report by telephone of a plague outbreak in the Tenth District of Gannan, hundreds of miles away. At 7:00 AM, a large truck carrying more than a dozen members of the epidemic prevention team, led by Jin Peigang, set off. They arrived at the scene at 4:00 PM that day and immediately began emergency flea killing, rat extermination, and disinfection work in the homes of the villagers who found the field mice. On the 6th, Wang Dianyue, the captain of the epidemic prevention team, arrived with dozens of people and immediately launched a comprehensive flea killing, rat extermination, and disinfection campaign in the thirty-one *tun* (these four administrative villages have a total of forty-five *tun*) where the field mice were found. Resolute steps were taken to isolate the *tun* from each other and completely cut off traffic with areas without plague. On the 7th, Lu Shutian, the leader of the research team of the provincial prevention and control agency, and Lu Zhuang, the deputy leader, also led a group of health personnel to the scene and began preventive vaccinations that day. Out of the district's total population of 8,469, all but those over 70 years old, children under 5 years old, patients, and pregnant women were vaccinated, with a total of 7,148 people vaccinated, a vaccination rate of 84.4%. On the 8th and 9th, Zhang Jiefan, the dean of the Northeast Plague Prevention and Control Institute in Siping City, and plague expert Ji Shuli were also sent to the scene by special plane by the Northeast People's Government Health Department to participate in inspection and prevention work.

While carrying out flea killing, rat extermination, disinfection, and vaccination work, the comrades of the epidemic prevention team also carried out extensive and in-depth patriotic health propaganda. The masses in these four administrative villages responded to the government's call with immediate action. They moved all their furniture out to be exposed to the sun that day, burned the floors and *kang* with fire, and universally plastered the *kangs*, plastered the walls, padded the ground, and blocked all holes. To prevent the spread of fleas, they also spontaneously eliminated all cats and dogs that day.

On the morning of July 16th, when I accompanied the members of the International Scientific Committee to Gannan for a visit, I saw the new face of the new Chinese countryside. The concrete facts also answered why the American murderers' attempt to spread the plague in this area was completely defeated.

We first arrived at Wang Youjia's house in Sanlu, Minzhong Village, Tenth District of Gannan. He is 53 years old, wearing new black cloth pants and a clean white undershirt. His home was cleaned neatly, giving people a fresh and pleasant impression. The windows were fitted with gauze, the tableware had gauze covers, and the sauce jars in the courtyard were also covered with cloth. About 50 meters to the left of his house was a well where he found the dead field mice dropped by enemy planes on the morning of April 5th. Later, the comrades of the epidemic prevention team helped him drain the well and put in medicine for disinfection. Now the well has a wooden cover and is locked, only opened when drawing water.

Chen Wanfu is also a 53-year-old man. He lives in Fourth Lu, Minzhong Village. I saw on the long table in his house, in addition to the usual furniture commonly used by farmers, there were also two bars of soap, three bars of laundry soap, five toothbrushes in two magnetic cups, and two tubes of toothpaste. Three towels were placed on the towel rack. He told me that since the American planes dropped the dead field mice here, the patriotic health campaign has been launched, and each member of his family has bought a toothbrush and towel. There are six people in his family: the old couple, the eldest son, the eldest daughter-in-law, and two underage sons. One son went out and took his own towel and toothbrush, and the daughter-in-law and the old lady also took their towels to the field. Although this is an ordinary little thing, what a gratifying change it is for the countryside, which has always shared towels and had no habit of brushing teeth!

On the way back, I thought: Today's new Chinese countryside, especially the Northeast countryside, is fully equipped with the material conditions to improve sanitation work. As long as the cadres are good at enlightening and guiding, every village can establish and maintain the same good hygiene habits as the four administrative villages in the Tenth District of Gannan.

Although we did not visit many *tun* in person, we passed through many towns and villages by car. Every place, like the homes we visited, gave us the same fresh and joyful impression. In Pingyang Town, I saw that each house had a wooden trash can, painted white, in front of the door, and every house had glass windows or screens. Many patriotic health propaganda posters and slogans to smash American imperialism's germ bombs were also posted on the walls: "Exterminate rats, exterminate fleas, exterminate flies, exterminate mosquitoes, exterminate lice," "Environmental sanitation is everyone's responsibility," "Resolutely smash the American imperialists' heinous bacteriological warfare," etc. In Dongyang Town, at the ferry of Nenjiang, and in other villages along the way, I saw clean environmental sanitation and new rural families with simple and feasible sanitation equipment.

The "effect" of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare is something they could not have imagined; the creative and immense power of the people of the new democratic country is also something they could not have imagined. Our complete prevention of the artificial spread of the plague by the American aggressors in Gannan shows the great concern of governments at all levels for the interests of the people, and demonstrates the people's resolute support and trust in the government's call. All of this more concentratedly and vividly demonstrates the superiority of the new democratic system.

The American aggressors' intention to kill our peaceful people with the vicious plague has been completely crushed in the face of our country's strong people's forces. The Chinese people, who have stood up, are, together with peace-loving people all over the world, vigilantly watching for any new conspiracy of the American aggressors, and are confident of completely crushing it like they crushed the plague in Gannan!

    甘南十区人民是怎样战胜美国细菌战的
    新华社记者  林麟
    四月四日午夜十二时十分，美国飞机把染有鼠疫杆菌的小田鼠丢在黑龙江省甘南县第十区的新民、民众、公议、工农四个行政村里。次日清晨就被当地居民陆续发现，很快报告到区、县、省和东北人民政府，由于采取了紧急灭蚤、杀鼠及消毒措施，开展了普遍的群众性的爱国卫生运动，把美国侵略者企图以可怕的鼠疫来杀害我国和平人民的罪恶计划彻底地粉碎了。七月十二日，东北人民政府卫生部白希清副部长报告这一情况时，国际科学委员会的委员们，都为这一奇迹而赞扬不已。
    这诚然是一个奇迹。然而，这一奇迹是经过紧张的战斗和严密的工作才获得的。
    四月五日上午六时，住在齐齐哈尔市的黑龙江省人民政府卫生厅，就从电话中得到远在数百里之外的甘南十区发生鼠情的报告。七时，一辆大卡车就载着以金培钢为首的防疫中队的十多个人出发了，他们在当天的下午四时赶到现场，当时就有重点地在发现田鼠的老乡家里展开紧急的灭蚤、杀鼠及消毒工作。六日，防疫大队长王殿钺率领着数十人赶到，随即在发现田鼠的三十一个屯（这四个行政村共有四十五个屯）展开全面的灭蚤、杀鼠消毒工作。并采取坚决步骤，实行屯与屯的隔离，与没有鼠情的地区完全断绝交通。七日，省防治机构的研究组组长卢书田、副组长卢庄也率领一部卫生人员赶到现场，当天开始了预防注射。该区总人口为八千四百六十九名，除七十岁以上老人、五岁以下儿童及病人、孕妇外均已注射，注射的总人数为七千一百四十八名，注射率为百分之八十四点四。八日、九日，在四平市的东北鼠疫防治院的张杰藩院长和鼠疫专家纪树立也由东北人民政府卫生部派专机先后送他们到现场，参加检验和防治工作。
    在进行灭蚤、杀鼠、消毒、注射等工作的同时，防疫队的同志还进行了广泛深入的爱国卫生宣传工作。这四个行政村的群众，以即时的行动响应了政府的号召。他们在当天就把全部家具搬出曝晒，地上、炕上都用火烧过，还普遍地泥炕、泥墙、垫地、堵死一切洞穴。为了防止跳蚤的传播，他们还自发地在当天就把猫、狗全部消灭。
    七月十六日上午，我随国际科学委员会的委员们前往甘南参观时，我看到新中国农村的新面貌。具体的事实，也回答了美国杀人犯企图在这个地区撒布鼠疫为什么会遭到彻底的失败。
    我们首先到达的是甘南第十区民众村三闾的王有家，他五十三岁，穿着新的黑布裤子，上身是洁白的汗衫。他的家里打扫得清清爽爽，给人以清新愉快的印象。窗上装有纱布，饭具上有纱罩，放在院子里的酱缸也有布盖。在他房子的左边约五十公尺处有一口井，四月五日的早晨他曾在这井里发现敌机投下的死田鼠。以后，防疫队的同志帮助他把井水淘干，放上药水消毒。现在这口井已添了木盖，并锁上锁，只在打水时才开放。
    陈万福也是一位五十三岁的老汉。他住在民众村第四闾。我看见他家的条桌上，除了一般的农家常用的家具外，还有两块香皂、三块洗衣皂、两个磁杯里分放着五把牙刷、二管牙膏，手巾架上放着三条毛巾。他告诉我：自从美国的飞机在这里丢下死田鼠以后，开展了爱国卫生运动了，他家里每个人买了牙刷和毛巾。他家共六口人：老俩口、长子、长媳，还有两个未成年的儿子。有一个儿子出外带走了自己的毛巾和牙刷，媳妇、老太太下地也带走了自己的毛巾。这虽是一件普通的小事，但是，这对一向共用毛巾、没有刷牙习惯的农村，该是一件多么可喜的变化呵！
    我在回来的路上想着：今天的新中国农村，特别是东北农村，完全具备了改善卫生工作的物质条件，只要干部善于启发诱导，每一个农村，都可能建立和保持像甘南十区四个行政村一样的良好的卫生习惯的。
    我们亲自访问的屯子虽然不多，但是，我们汽车经过的市镇村屯却不少。每一个地方都像我们看过的人家一样，同样给我们以清新、欢乐的印象。在平阳镇上，我看到每家门前设有刷得洁白的木质垃圾箱，家家装有玻璃窗或者纱窗，墙上还贴了许多爱国卫生宣传画和粉碎美帝国主义细菌弹的标语：“灭鼠、灭蚤、灭蝇、灭蚊、灭虱”“环境卫生人人有责”“坚决粉碎美帝国主义万恶的细菌战”等。在东阳镇，在嫩江的渡口，在沿途其他村庄，我都看到了整洁的环境卫生和有着简而可行的卫生设备的崭新的农村家庭。
    美国侵略者的细菌战，得到这样的“效果”，是它们设想不到的；新民主主义国家人民创造性的巨大力量，也是它们设想不到的。我们在甘南完全制止美国侵略者人工撒布鼠疫的发生，说明了各级人民政府对人民利益的巨大关怀，说明了人民对政府号召的坚决拥护和信赖，这一切更集中地生动地说明了新民主主义制度的优越性。
    美国侵略者想以狠毒的鼠疫来杀害我国和平人民的目的，在我国强大的人民力量面前是被彻底地粉碎了。站起来了的中国人民，正和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，警惕地注视着美国侵略者任何新的阴谋，并有信心地像粉碎甘南鼠疫一样来彻底地粉碎它！（新华社）
