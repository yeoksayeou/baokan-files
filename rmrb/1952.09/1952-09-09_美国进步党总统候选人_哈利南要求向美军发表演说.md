Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 5th: TASS reported from New York on the 5th: American Progressive Party presidential candidate Hallinan issued a statement to the press saying that he had written to Secretary of Defense Lovett, requesting permission to address US troops on American overseas military radio, just like Eisenhower and Stevenson. Hallinan wrote in the letter: "Since Eisenhower and Stevenson have agreed not to talk to all American soldiers about the central question of 'why we are fighting in Korea and when the war will end' during the campaign, it is necessary to let our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and women serving in the military know that the Progressive Party has proposed a solution to replace the war. Black soldiers should have the opportunity to hear that, for the first time in American history, a black woman is running for Vice President of the United States. This is the only way to allow American soldiers to understand the necessary facts in order to decide who to cast their absentee ballots for."

The "Daily Worker's" correspondent in Indianapolis reported: The Indiana Progressive Party announced that the Progressive Party in Indiana has met the necessary conditions to nominate Hallinan and Mrs. Bass to formally participate in the election in the state. 11,000 people in the state have signed the application to nominate Progressive Party candidates, while the state law stipulates that the necessary number of applicants is 7,900. The "National Guardian" weekly reported: Last week, the Progressive Party had fully met all the necessary conditions stipulated by the election laws of Texas, New Mexico, and Kentucky. In this way, the Progressive Party already has the right to participate in elections in eighteen states.

    哈利南要求向美军发表演说
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社纽约五日讯：美国进步党总统候选人哈利南向报界发表声明说，他已写信给国防部长罗维特，要求准许他像艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森一样在美国海外军中电台向美军发表演说。哈利南在信中写道：“既然艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森都已商定在竞选运动中不向美国的全体士兵谈论‘我们为什么要在朝鲜作战、战争何时结束’这个中心问题，那么就有必要使我们的士兵、水兵、空军和在军中服务的妇女们知道：进步党已提出一个代替战争的办法。应该使黑人士兵有机会听到：在美国的历史上第一次有一个黑人妇女在竞选美国副总统。这是让美国士兵了解必要的事实，以便决定把他们的缺席票投给谁的唯一办法。”
    “工人日报”驻印第安纳波里斯记者报道：印第安纳州进步党宣布，进步党在印第安纳州已经具备了提名哈利南和巴斯夫人在该州正式参加竞选的必要条件。该州已有一万一千人在提名进步党候选人的申请书上签名，该州法律规定的必要申请人数是七千九百人。“国民前卫”周刊报道：上星期进步党已经完全具备了得克萨斯、新墨西哥、肯塔基各州的选举法所规定的一切必要条件。这样，进步党就已经有权在十八个州参加竞选。
