    Extinguish the Flames of War, Save Peace
    Hua Luogeng
    Peace! Peace! This is the cry from the bottom of the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, the demand of people all over the world, and the heartfelt desire of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions.
    Of course, peace is indivisible, but the people of Asia and the Pacific region feel the importance of peace more deeply than people in other parts of the world. Leaving aside the painful historical experiences of the Asian people in the last hundred years, who were enslaved, ravaged, sought peace but could not find it, and sought tranquility but could not achieve it, just the vividly remembered flames of war ignited by Japanese militarism are enough to cause great pain and deep wounds! It swept through most of China; ravaged Southeast Asia; encompassed the South Pacific Islands; and also attacked Pearl Harbor. The losses caused to the people are incalculable, and the hearts of the people in the countries along the Pacific coast are deeply imprinted with the mark of the cruelty of war. Finally, Japan itself suffered the even more brutal and tragic blow of the atomic bomb. But the initiators of the war were capitalists and warlords, while the victims killed in Nagasaki and Hiroshima were all unarmed people—including the hundreds of thousands of lives of women, children, and the elderly. Therefore, the driving force for the people of the Asian and Pacific regions to demand peace does not come merely from an empty, abstract moral concept, but from an inner demand that has been tempered in the fire of terrible war. Therefore, there is also the determination to fight for peace.
    The past events are still vivid in our minds, but Asia has once again been plunged into turmoil. Japan is being remilitarized, reminding people of the monstrous disasters caused by militarist Japan not long ago. Peaceful farmers in Vietnam are being slaughtered while cultivating their land; peaceful workers in Malaya are being murdered while tapping rubber; the people of Japan are suffering national subjugation-like bullying and humiliation; and unrest is evident everywhere in the Asian and Pacific regions. But an even more cruel and ruthless situation has appeared in Korea: children in cradles and mothers nursing their babies have become the targets of slaughter, and inhumane bacteriological weapons are being used. This forces anyone with a conscience to burst into anger and makes everyone feel that if we do not sweat today to work hard to extinguish the flames of war that have already been ignited in Asia and strive to save peace, we will have to shed countless times more blood in the future to achieve peace.
    What we hope for is that everyone will cultivate their own garden, build their own homes, and establish international friendship and cooperation on the basis of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. We do not approve of one country interfering in the internal affairs of another country, or one country's troops being stationed on the territory of another country. If Japan occupied the United States and demanded naval and air force bases from the United States, we would definitely oppose it, but we also oppose the United States occupying Japan and demanding naval and air force bases from Japan. If Asian troops invaded the Americas, we would resolutely oppose it, but we also oppose American troops coming to Asia to enslave the people of Asia. We oppose France enslaving Vietnam, just as we would oppose Vietnam enslaving France with the same sentiment. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." The relationship between countries should not be one of enslavement and being enslaved, but should be a relationship of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence. If countries are to engage in competition, it should be a competition on how to make the lives of their own people better, not a killing competition or an arms race.
    The flames of war in Asia and the Pacific region have been ignited by war-mongers, and everyone with a conscience has a responsibility to extinguish these potentially spreading flames. The fate of peace is in danger, and we must quickly strive forward to save peace. (Xinhua News Agency)

    扑灭战火，拯救和平
    华罗庚
    和平！和平！这是千百万人从心底发出的呼声，全世界人民的要求，也是亚洲及太平洋区域人民的由衷的渴望。
    当然，和平是不可分割的，但亚洲及太平洋区域的人民对和平的重要性体会得比世界各处深刻些。远者如近百年来亚洲人民被奴役、遭蹂躏、求和平而不得和平、求安宁而不能安宁的惨痛历史遭遇，暂且不说。就是刚过去的印象犹新的日本军国主义所燃起的战火，也就够痛巨创深的了！它席卷了大半个中国；蹂躏了东南亚；囊括了南洋群岛；还突击了珍珠港。对人民所造成的损失不可数计，在太平洋沿岸国家的人民的心上都深深地印上了战争残酷的烙印。最后日本自己也遭受了更残暴的悲惨的原子弹的打击。但发动战争者是资本家和军阀，而长崎广岛被杀害者却都是非武装的人民——包括妇孺老幼的十万生灵。所以亚洲及太平洋区域的人民要求和平的动力，不是仅仅发自空洞的抽象的道德的概念，而是经受了可怕的战祸，在火的洗炼中产生出来的内心的要求。因之也有为和平而斗争的决心。
    往事历历，还在心头，但亚洲又复卷入动荡不安之中，日本正在被重新军国主义化，使人想起不久之前军国主义日本所闯下的滔天大祸。越南的和平农民在耕耘时遭屠杀；马来亚的和平工人在割胶时遭谋害；日本的人民正遭受着亡国一般的欺凌和侮辱；亚洲及太平洋区域各处都显得动荡不安。但更残酷无情的情况却出现在朝鲜：摇篮里的孩子们和奶孩子的母亲们都成了屠杀的对象，绝灭人性的细菌武器正在被使用着。这使任何一个有良知的人，都不得不怒气勃发，使每一个人都觉得：如果今天我们不流汗来努力扑灭亚洲所已燃起的战火，努力拯救和平，将来我们要流无数倍的鲜血，才能够获得和平。
    我们所希望的是大家都各自耕耘自己的园地，建设自己的家园，并且在互助互利的基础上建立起国际友情和合作，我们不赞成一国干涉另一国的内政，一国的军队驻在另一国的国土上。如果日本占领了美国而向美国索取海空军根据地，我们一定反对，但我们也反对美国占领日本而向日本索取海空军根据地。如果亚洲的军队侵入美洲，我们坚决反对，但我们也反对美国的军队跑到亚洲来奴役亚洲的人民。我们反对法国奴役越南，正如我们将以同样的心情来反对如果越南去奴役法国一样。中国有句古话：“己所不欲，勿施于人。”国与国之间应当不是奴役和被奴役的关系，而应当是互相尊重和平共处的关系。如果国与国之间要展开竞赛，应当是如何使自己的人民生活过得更好的竞赛，而不是杀人竞赛、军备竞赛。
    亚洲和太平洋区域的战火已经被战争贩子们燃着了，每一个有良知的人都有责任来扑灭这可能蔓延的战火。和平的命运在危险中，我们必须赶快地奋勇向前去拯救和平。（新华社）
