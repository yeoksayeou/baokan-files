Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th (TASS): According to the "Mainichi Shimbun", the U.S. Far East Command sent a very important letter to Prime Minister Yoshida at the end of August. The letter, signed by Chief of Staff Hickey, discussed the US plan to accelerate the rearmament of Japan, and allowed the Japanese government to use 38 billion yen out of the 56 billion yen earmarked as so-called "joint defense" funds to rearm Japan. The contents of the letter were kept strictly secret, but it is said that this letter reflects the current US Department of Defense's policy of accelerating the rearmament of Japan. The letter suggested that the Japanese government expand the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" from four divisions to fourteen divisions within two years.

    远东美军总司令部致函吉田
    催促日本扩充“警察后备队”
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社东京十六日讯：据“每日新闻”报道，远东美军总司令部八月底给吉田首相一封非常重要的信，该信由参谋长希凯署名，信里讲到美国加紧重新武装日本的计划，准许日本政府从预定作为所谓“共同防御”费的五百六十亿日元中动用三百八十亿日元来重新武装日本。信的内容严守秘密，但是，据说这封信反映着目前美国国防部加紧重新武装日本的政策。该信建议日本政府在两年内把日本“警察后备队”由四个师扩充到十四个师。
