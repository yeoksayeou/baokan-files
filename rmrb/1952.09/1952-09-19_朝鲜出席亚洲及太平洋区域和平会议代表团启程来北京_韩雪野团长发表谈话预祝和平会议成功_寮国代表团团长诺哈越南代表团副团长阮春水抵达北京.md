Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th - The Korean delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, led by head of delegation Han Xueye, departed from Pyongyang on the afternoon of the 17th to go to Beijing. Those who came to see them off included: Park Jung-ai, Vice-Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Support of Peace; Committee members Heo Jeong-suk, Ki Seok-bok, Lee Mun-il; Secretary-General Jeon Dong-hyeok; and many people from all walks of life in Pyongyang and journalists.
    Before his departure, Head of Delegation Han Xueye made the following statement to a reporter from this agency:
    The Korean delegation, representing the will of all the Korean people, is departing today for Beijing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    We believe that the existing threat of war is extremely serious, and this is not just a problem for that particular region or the invaded country, but a problem for the whole world. Therefore, people all over the world are actively defending peace. The great movement to defend peace is unprecedentedly broad, and the people of every invaded region are rising up to defend their own land. The sixteen hundred million people in the Asian and Pacific regions, which contain the majority of the world's population, are universally suffering from the threat of imperialist aggression. The aggressors still dream of making Asia their object of aggression as in the past, but Asia today is not the Asia of the past. The people of Asian countries have launched a vigorous anti-aggression struggle, the most prominent of which is the anti-aggression struggle of the Korean people.
    The Korean people's anti-aggression struggle is not only for Korea, but also for the peace and security of the whole world. Therefore, people all over the world are supporting and supporting the just war of the Korean people, especially the assistance of the Chinese people, which has become a new model of internationalism for people all over the world. The Chinese people sent their most outstanding sons and daughters - the Chinese People's Volunteers - to directly assist the Korean people with their own blood.
    The struggle of the Korean people with the help of the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as the achievements of the anti-aggression struggle of the people all over the world, prove that any imperialist aggression conspiracy can be completely defeated. The strong and united strength of the people all over the world not only makes the imperialist ambitions to dominate the world a forever unrealizable dream, but also makes the imperialist ambition to occupy any region impossible to succeed.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is of great significance for uniting the people of all countries against imperialist aggression. It will surely make a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and become an important driving force for the movement to defend peace in Asia and world peace. The Korean people unanimously and enthusiastically expect and wish the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference a success.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Noha, head of the Lao delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and Nguyen Xuan Thuy, deputy head of the Vietnamese delegation and chairman of the Vietnam Journalists Association, arrived in Beijing by train on the afternoon of the 18th. Liu Guan-yi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defence of World Peace, Hu Zhongchi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, and Jin Ziming, Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, went to the station to welcome them. Also at the station to welcome them were D. V. D. Ramaratha, head of the Ceylon delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and delegate Sanggadasan, Indonesian representative Utosia, New Zealand representatives Rewi Alley and Arthur Houlker, Vietnamese representative Yang Bailian and U Law from Burma. Pham Binh, Second Secretary of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, also went to welcome them.

    【新华社平壤十八日电】参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的朝鲜代表团在团长韩雪野的率领下，已于十七日午后自平壤启程赴北京。前往欢送的有：朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长朴正爱，委员许贞琡、奇石福、李文日，书记长田东赫，以及平壤市各界人士和新闻工作者等多人。
    韩雪野团长在临行前对本社记者发表谈话如下：
    朝鲜代表团代表全朝鲜人民的意志，在今天动身赴北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    我们认为：目前存在着的战争威胁是十分严重的，这不仅是那个特殊地区或那个受侵略国家的问题，而且是全世界的问题，因而全世界人民都在积极地捍卫和平。伟大的保卫和平运动是空前地壮阔，每一个受侵略地区的人民，都奋起保卫他们自己的国土。在拥有全世界大部分人口的亚洲及太平洋区域的十六亿人民，正普遍地遭受着帝国主义的侵略威胁。侵略者们还是像过去一样地妄想把亚洲作为它们的侵略对象，但是现在的亚洲已不是过去的亚洲了，亚洲各国人民已轰轰烈烈地展开了反侵略的斗争，其中最突出的就是朝鲜人民的反侵略斗争。
    朝鲜人民的反侵略斗争不仅仅是为了朝鲜，而且是为了全世界的和平与安全，所以全世界人民都在声援和支持朝鲜人民的正义战争，特别是中国人民的援助，已成为全世界人民国际主义的新榜样。中国人民派遣了他们最优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军，以自己的鲜血直接援助着朝鲜人民。
    在中国人民志愿军帮助之下的朝鲜人民的斗争，以及全世界人民反侵略斗争的成就，证明帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋是完全可以击破的。全世界人民坚强团结的力量，不但使帝国主义称霸全世界的狂妄企图成为永远不能实现的迷梦，而且使帝国主义侵占任何一个地区的野心也不可能得逞。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对于团结各国人民反对帝国主义侵略具有重大的意义，它必将在保卫亚洲和平的事业上作出巨大的贡献，成为保卫亚洲和平与世界和平运动的重要推动力。朝鲜人民一致热烈地期望和预祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成功。
    【新华社十八日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的寮国代表团团长诺哈和越南代表团副团长越南新闻记者协会主席阮春水于十八日下午乘车抵达北京。前往车站欢迎的有：中国人民保卫世界和平委员会秘书长刘贯一、宣传部副部长胡仲持，中华全国总工会国际联络部副部长金子明等人。到车站欢迎的还有出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的锡兰代表团团长达马拉塔纳和代表桑姆加塔桑、印度尼西亚代表乌托西亚、新西兰代表艾黎和艾启赫、越南代表杨白莲及缅甸的吴拉。越南民主共和国驻华代表团二等秘书范平亦前往欢迎。
