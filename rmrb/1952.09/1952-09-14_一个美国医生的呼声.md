    A Plea from an American Doctor
    The American "New York Times" recently published a letter from New York doctor Joseph B. Furst. The letter demanded a stop to the barbaric bombing by American aggressors in Korea. The appearance of this letter in the "New York Times" is noteworthy because it reflects the righteous indignation of the broad masses of the people caused by the barbaric bombing of the American aggressors, which even the newspapers of the American reactionary class cannot conceal. Furst's letter reads:
    "In the May 9th issue of 'Time' magazine, I read the story of how the United Nations Air Force destroyed the ancient city of Suan in a day-long air raid. The raid began by dumping 12,000 gallons of burning gasoline on the city and its inhabitants.
    "As a doctor, I am dedicated to protecting human life. This act of complete destruction of a two-square-mile city horrified me. Undoubtedly, this would cause tens of thousands of elderly people, the infirm, hospital patients, women, and children to be bombed to death or burned to death. In this way, the United Nations Air Force—mostly American and under the command of American commanders—killed or injured more people in one day than I, as a doctor, have treated in my entire life.
    "In the 1930s, we scrutinized newsreels of Italian fascists bombing Abyssinians. In the 1940s, we scrutinized newsreels of Nazis bombing European cities. And now, in the 1950s, how can we sit idly by and listen to the American Air Force doing the same thing!"
    Furst demanded a halt to these terrible bombings. He said: "There is no good person in America or the world who does not condemn such things. Can we afford to lose the support of every enlightened person in the world? Can we maintain our tradition of peace and democracy by bombing and slaughtering Korean civilians?" He appealed: "Let us end this Korean War!"

    一个美国医生的呼声
    美国“纽约时报”不久以前登载了纽约医生费尔斯特（Joseph B.Furst）写的一封信。信里要求制止美国侵略者在朝鲜的野蛮轰炸。这封信出现在“纽约时报”上是值得注意的，因为这反映着美国侵略者的野蛮轰炸所引起的广大人民的义愤，甚至美国反动阶级的报纸也无法加以掩饰了。费尔斯特的信里写道：
    “我在五月九日的‘时代’杂志上读到联合国空军如何以整天的空袭毁灭遂安古城的故事。这空袭的一开始就向着这个城市及其居民倾倒了一万二千加仑燃烧汽油。
    “作为一个医生，我致力于保护人类的生命。这种完全破坏一个两平方哩的城市的行为使我极为惊骇。无疑的，这会使成千上万的老年人、病弱者、医院病人、妇女、小孩被炸死或者烧死。这样，联合国的空军——大部分是美国的和在美国司令官指挥之下的——在一天之内杀伤的人就比我这个医生一生中所治疗的人还要多。
    “在三十年代里，我们细看过意大利法西斯轰炸阿比西尼亚人的新闻影片。在四十年代里，我们细看过纳粹轰炸欧洲城市的新闻影片。而如今，在五十年代里，我们听到美国空军正在干着同样的事情，怎么可以装得心安理得呢！”
    费尔斯特要求制止这些可怖的轰炸。他说：“在美国或者全世界没有一个善良的人不谴责这种事情的。难道我们可以失去世界上每一个有见解的人的支持吗？难道我们可以用屠杀朝鲜平民的轰炸手段来保持我们和平、民主的传统吗？”他呼吁：“让我们结束这个朝鲜战争吧！”
