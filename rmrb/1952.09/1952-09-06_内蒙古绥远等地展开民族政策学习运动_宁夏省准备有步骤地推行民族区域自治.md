Xinhua News Agency Report: After the promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" and related laws, people of all ethnic groups in various places expressed their warm support and launched a study campaign on ethnic policies. Ningxia Province is also actively preparing to promote ethnic regional autonomy.

People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province warmly support the promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" and related laws. Minority cadres and students from units directly under the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, first-level institutions in Suiyuan Province, ethnic cadre schools, and ethnic middle schools have held symposiums to discuss and study. After seeing the ethnic policies and laws, all the Hui people and Ahongs in Gui Sui and Baotou cities also enthusiastically launched study and discussions in reading groups.

In order to carry out the ethnic policy study campaign, the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CPC Central Committee, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Suiyuan Provincial Committee of the CPC, and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government have recently issued instructions calling on all cadres of party, government organs, and people's organizations at all levels to earnestly study ethnic policies. On August 21, Ulanhu, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CPC Central Committee, made a report at a joint expanded meeting of cadres above the county level from the first-level institutions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the first-level institutions of Suiyuan Province. He elaborated in detail the spirit of the Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China. He asked all organs and departments to conscientiously carry out a study campaign on ethnic policies to improve all aspects of work. The Propaganda Department of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CPC Central Committee has issued 30,000 copies of collected books and documents on relevant laws and regulations to all leagues, banners, and counties under its jurisdiction; it is determined to conduct a three-month study campaign on ethnic policies. Newspapers, magazines, and people's radio stations in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have also made promoting ethnic policies their current central task. Local organizations at all levels under the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CPC Central Committee and the Suiyuan Provincial Committee of the CPC have decided to organize reporters and propagandists at all levels in September and October to extensively promote ethnic policies in agricultural and pastoral areas. More than 200 Tibetan cadres and students from various organs, people's organizations, and schools in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region held a symposium on August 29 to discuss various laws and documents related to ethnic regional autonomy. At the meeting, everyone combined the achievements of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region in the two years since its establishment and unanimously praised the wise measures of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao. Awang Jigme, Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, said: "The promulgation of the Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy and other laws was achieved through the bloodshed and sacrifice of countless martyrs and compatriots under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. We must strive to implement various ethnic policies in our actual work." Ge Tong Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the People's Government of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, said: "The changes in the Tibetan Autonomous Region in the two years since its establishment are unprecedented in history. Not only has our ethnic group been united like never before, but our lives have also been greatly improved due to the large-scale purchase of local products and specialties and the timely supply of various necessities by state-owned trading companies. Now, the People's Government of the Autonomous Region is also establishing schools in various districts and townships to train local talent. These are all victories for the ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party." Everyone who spoke at the meeting expressed their determination to earnestly study ethnic policies, vigorously promote them to the Tibetan people, and implement them in actual work. The Kangding Local Committee of the CPC issued instructions to the working committees of all counties under its jurisdiction, requiring responsible cadres in various localities to seriously lead the study of ethnic policies in light of the actual situation of ethnic work in various regions over the past two years.

The Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Southwest Military and Political Committee invited representatives of various ethnic minorities in Chongqing on August 28 to discuss the three documents on ethnic issues recently promulgated by the Central People's Government, including the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China". More than 40 representatives from 11 ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Miao, Yi, Hui, and Minjia, attended the meeting. During the discussion, the representatives unanimously supported the promulgation of these three documents. Sun Kebaton, Director of the Panchen Lama's Chongqing Office, said: After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our ethnic minorities have gained the right to be masters of our own affairs. Chairman Mao's concern and care for us are truly meticulous. The promulgation of these three documents will enable greater development in ethnic work in the future, and ethnic areas and people of all ethnic groups will be more prosperous and united. Representatives of the Hui, Manchu, and Mongolian ethnic groups scattered in Chongqing were particularly pleased with the promulgation of the "Decision on Guaranteeing that All Scattered Ethnic Minorities Equally Enjoy Ethnic Rights." The representatives pledged to take the lead in studying and doing their jobs well.

The Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government held its second enlarged meeting from August 21 to 25. According to the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" and related laws, and in light of the specific situation of various ethnic groups in Ningxia Province, the meeting discussed and proposed the steps and methods for promoting ethnic regional autonomy in Ningxia Province. The meeting pointed out that Ningxia Province is a multi-ethnic mixed settlement area. In addition to the Han ethnic group, there are Hui, Mongolian, Manchu and other ethnic minorities, accounting for nearly one-third of the province's population. Since liberation three years ago, all ethnic minorities have made great achievements in agriculture and animal husbandry, and have also trained a large number of ethnic minority cadres, laying the foundation for the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy. Therefore, the meeting believes that in areas where the Hui and Mongolian ethnic groups live in concentrated communities, autonomous regions equivalent to the special district, county, district, and township levels should be established step by step according to different circumstances. The meeting decided that the representatives of all ethnic groups attending the meeting should go to the ethnic minority communities after the meeting to widely publicize the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" and related laws, and organize people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life to study and prepare for the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy.

    【本报讯】据新华社讯：“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”及有关法令颁布后，各地各族人民表示热烈的拥护，同时展开民族政策的学习运动。宁夏省并积极准备推行民族区域自治工作。
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省各民族人士热烈拥护“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”及有关法令的颁布。内蒙古自治区人民政府直属机关和绥远省一级机关、民族干部学校、民族中学等单位的少数民族干部和学生，都分别举行了座谈会，进行讨论和学习。归绥、包头两市全体回民、阿訇等看到各项民族政策法令后，也在读报组内热烈展开学习和讨论。
    为了开展民族政策学习运动，中共中央内蒙古分局、内蒙古自治区人民政府、中共绥远省委员会、绥远省人民政府等最近分别发出指示，号召各级党、政机关以及人民团体的全体干部，认真学习民族政策。八月二十一日，中共中央内蒙古分局书记乌兰夫在内蒙古自治区一级与绥远省一级直属机关县级以上干部的联合扩大会议上作报告，他详细阐明了中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要的精神。他要求各机关、各部门认真地开展一个民族政策的学习运动，以便把各项工作提高一步。中共中央内蒙古分局宣传部已向所属各盟、旗、县发出有关法令文件的汇集书刊三万册；确定以三个月时间进行民族政策的学习运动。内蒙古自治区的各报刊杂志和人民广播电台，也都将宣传民族政策列为目前的中心工作。中共中央内蒙古分局所属各级地方组织和中共绥远省委员会决定在九、十两月内组织各级报告员、宣传员，深入农业地区和畜牧地区广泛开展关于民族政策的宣传工作。西康藏族自治区各机关、各人民团体、各学校的藏族干部和学员二百多人，在八月二十九日举行座谈会，讨论有关民族区域自治的各项法令和文件。会上，大家结合西康藏族自治区成立两年来的工作成就，一致赞颂中央人民政府和毛主席这一系列的英明措施。西康藏族自治区人民政府副主席阿旺嘉错说：“民族区域自治实施纲要等法令的公布，是毛主席和共产党领导下的无数先烈同胞流血牺牲换来的，我们一定要在实际工作中为贯彻各项民族政策而奋斗。”西康藏族自治区人民政府民政处副处长格桐活佛说：“藏族自治区成立两年来的变化是历史上所没有的。我们民族内部不但空前团结了，而且由于国营贸易公司大量收购土产、特产和及时供应各种必需品，使我们的生活也大大改善了。现在自治区人民政府又在各区、乡设立学校，培养本民族人材，这些都是中国共产党民族政策的胜利。”会上所有发言的人，都表示要认真地学习民族政策，并大力向藏族人民宣传，在实际工作中贯彻实行。中共康定地方委员会向所属各县工作委员会发出指示，要求各地负责干部结合两年来各地区民族工作的实际情况，认真领导学习民族政策。
    西南军政委员会民族事务委员会于八月二十八日邀请了在重庆的各少数民族代表，座谈中央人民政府最近颁布的“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”等三个有关民族问题的文件。到会的有藏、苗、彝、回、民家等十一个民族的代表四十多人。在讨论中，代表们一致拥护这三个文件的公布。班禅驻重庆办事处处长孙克巴顿说：中华人民共和国成立后，我们少数民族获得了当家作主的权利。毛主席对我们的关怀和照顾真是无微不至。这三个文件的公布，将使今后的民族工作有更大的发展，各民族地区和各民族人民将更加繁荣和团结。散居在重庆的回族、满族、蒙族等代表，特别高兴“关于保障一切散居的少数民族成分享有民族平等权利的决定”的颁布。代表们保证带头学习，做好工作。
    宁夏省人民政府民族事务委员会在八月二十一日到二十五日举行第二次扩大会议，根据“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”及有关法令，结合宁夏省各民族的具体情况，讨论并提出了在宁夏省推行民族区域自治的步骤和办法。会议指出：宁夏省是多民族杂居地区，除汉族外，有占全省人口近三分之一的回、蒙、满等少数民族。解放三年以来，各少数民族在农业和畜牧经济上已获得很大成就，同时已培养了大批少数民族干部，给实行民族区域自治奠定了基础。因此会议认为：在回族和蒙族聚居的地区，应即分别不同情况，有步骤地成立等于专区、县、区、乡级的自治区。会议决定出席这次会议的各民族人士，在会议结束后即分赴各民族聚居地区广泛宣传“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”及有关法令，并组织各族各界人士学习，做好实行民族区域自治的准备工作。
