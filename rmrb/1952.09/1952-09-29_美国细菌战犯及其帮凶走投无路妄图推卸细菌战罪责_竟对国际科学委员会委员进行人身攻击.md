Xinhua News Agency, 27th. It has been ten days since the full text of the report of the "International Scientific Commission for Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China" was published, and the American government, which launched the bacteriological warfare, has been keeping its head down, afraid to come out and formally say a word in defense. The large amount of conclusive testimonial and material evidence provided in the International Scientific Commission report has forced Acheson's rumor company to cease fabricating outrageous lies to excuse their crimes.

The American government obviously knows that it is impossible to overturn so much testimonial and material evidence, so it has avoided this undeniable evidence from the very beginning and adopted gangster tactics, instructing its kept newspapers to launch defamatory personal attacks on the members of the International Scientific Commission. This attack was first launched by the Wall Street mouthpiece, "The New York Times". "The New York Times" used the unique tone of the American intelligence agency, the "House Un-American Activities Committee," on the 16th and 17th to accuse the members of the International Scientific Commission of being disloyal to the "group accused by the Communists of using bacteriological weapons" and openly threatened, "The United Nations and relevant member states should have the responsibility to restrain those who are considered scientists." Then the "New York Times" "discovered" that the scientists participating in the International Scientific Commission "all had varying degrees of Communist connections." Following the "New York Times," some reactionary newspapers in the invading and subservient countries also began to shout and scream, repeating what the "New York Times" had already said over and over again. The American government is obviously trying to rely on this defamatory attack to deflect the International Scientific Commission's fatal blow against it.

However, people have long known that the threat of "you are a Communist" or "you have connections with the Communists" has become an unfailing weapon for American thugs to extort and cover up their ugly deeds. For example, the American columnist Pearson was recently subjected to this kind of intimidation for revealing the scandal of Republican Vice Presidential candidate Nixon accepting huge subsidies from wealthy businessmen in a radio program. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 22nd, Pearson said that before his broadcast, Nixon's campaign car made a phone call "warning me that if I attacked him, he would accuse me of being pro-Communist." The American reactionary newspapers' personal attacks on the scientists of the International Scientific Commission are as despicable and shameless as Nixon.

But no matter how the American bacteriological warfare criminals and their accomplices play their shameless gangster tricks, they dare not deny any point in the content of the International Scientific Commission report or the confessions of the four American air force prisoners of war, which confirms their crimes. Their clamoring is like a dragonfly trying to shake a stone pillar to the International Scientific Commission's report. Not only can it not overturn the report's solemn conclusion, but it also makes people see through their desperate situation.

    美国细菌战犯及其帮凶走投无路妄图推卸细菌战罪责
    竟对国际科学委员会委员进行人身攻击
    【新华社二十七日讯】自从“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”报告书全文发表以来，已经十天了，发动细菌战的美国政府一直缩着头颈，不敢伸出来正式说一句声辩的话。国际科学委员会报告书中所提供的大量确凿无疑的人证物证，已经迫使艾奇逊的造谣公司无法再制造狡赖罪行的漫天大谎。
    美国政府显然知道，要想推翻那么多的人证物证是办不到的事，因此它一开始就避开这些无法推翻的人证物证，而采取流氓手段，指使御用报纸对国际科学委员会的委员们进行诽谤性的人身攻击。这种攻击首先由华尔街的喉舌“纽约时报”开始。“纽约时报”连续在十六日和十七日用美国特务机关“非美活动委员会”的特有口吻，指责国际科学委员会的委员们不忠于“被共产党指责使用细菌武器的集团”，并且公然恫吓说：“联合国以及有关的会员国应该有责任把那些被认为是科学家的人约制住。”接着“纽约时报”就“发见”参加国际科学委员会的科学家们“都有着程度不同的共产党关系”。紧跟着“纽约时报”，侵朝仆从国家里的一些反动报纸也就学着舌头大呼小叫起来，把“纽约时报”已经说过的话翻来覆去地重搬一番。美国政府显然试图依靠这一诽谤性的攻击，挡过国际科学委员会对它的致命的一击。
    但是人们早就知道，所谓“你是共产党”、“你和共产党有关系”的恐吓，已经成了美国流氓敲诈勒索，遮掩自己丑行的无往而不用的法宝。比如最近美国专栏作家皮尔逊因为在电台节目中揭露共和党副总统候选人尼克松接受富商的巨额津贴的丑事，就受到了这一类的恐吓。据合众社华盛顿二十二日电，皮尔逊说，在他广播以前，尼克松的竞选专车来了一个电话，“警告我说，假如我抨击他的话，他将责我亲共”。美国反动报纸对国际科学委员会的科学家们进行人身攻击，其卑鄙无耻也正如尼克松一样。
    可是无论美国细菌战罪犯和他们的帮凶们如何玩弄无耻的流氓伎俩，他们不敢对国际科学委员会报告书的内容和四个美国空军战俘供词中的任何一点加以否认，这就确证了他们的罪行。他们的叫嚣，对于国际科学委员会的报告书，犹如蜻蜓撼大柱，不但不能推翻报告书的严正结论，反而使人看穿了他们走投无路的窘态。
