    Qiqihar Railway Bureau Basic Construction Department's Self-Criticism Regarding Blind Design and Construction
    Editor: Comrades Guan Guozhang and Han Lianyu criticized our Basic Construction work's errors of blind design and construction without surveying in the "Reader's Letters" column of the July 31st People's Daily. This criticism is basically correct, and we sincerely accept it.

    The reason for the rework of the new construction project of the technical school's building was due to our inadequate design beforehand. For example, in the project that started on May 6th, after part of the ramming was completed, it was discovered that the geology was soft and waterlogged. After repeated cone penetration tests, it was determined that the site was originally an old pond, with a ground bearing capacity of about 8.5 tons per square meter, which was lower than the design requirements. Therefore, the design department temporarily changed the design, deciding to drive 414 wooden piles and add steel bars to the original concrete foundation for reinforcement. After driving the wooden piles, it was found that the bearing capacity of some of the wooden piles was insufficient, and 59 more wooden piles were added. After the workers laid the steel bars for the concrete foundation project, the bureau director said that there was no need to lay steel rails. So the steel bars were pulled out of the more than two-meter-deep trenches, wasting more than a hundred workdays.

    The main reason for these errors is that our Basic Construction Department was careless and did not consider the details when reviewing the design work. In the future, we guarantee to do a good job in the review work, strengthen the exploration work, and no longer waste state resources.  Qiqihar Railway Administration Basic Construction Department

### 齐齐哈尔铁路局基本建设处关于盲目设计施工的检讨

    齐齐哈尔铁路局基本建设处关于盲目设计施工的检讨
    编辑同志：关国章、韩连玉同志在七月三十一日人民日报的“读者来信”栏内，批评了我们基本建设工作中不勘测就盲目设计施工的错误。这个批评基本上是正确的，我们诚恳接受。
    技术学校校舍新建工程所以返工，是由于我们事前设计不周。如五月六日开工的工程，一部分夯已经打好了，才发现地质软动并出水。经再三试锥钻探才判定该地原为旧池塘，地耐力每平方公尺八吨半左右，低于设计要求。于是设计部门临时变更设计，决定打木桩四百十四根，并在原混凝土基础内加钢筋以作补强。打完木桩以后，又发现一部分木桩支承力不足，又补了五十九根木桩。工人们把混凝土基础工程的钢筋铺好之后，局长才说不必铺钢轨。于是又把钢筋从二公尺多深的地槽里拔出来，计浪费了一百多个工。
    产生这些错误的主要原因，是我们基本建设处在复核设计工作时粗枝大叶考虑不周。今后我们保证作好复核工作，加强钻探工作，不再浪费国家资财。  齐齐哈尔铁路管理局基本建设处
