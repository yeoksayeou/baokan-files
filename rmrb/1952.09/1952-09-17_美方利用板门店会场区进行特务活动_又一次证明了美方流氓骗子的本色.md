Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th—The U.S. side has once again played a new trick in Panmunjom, attempting to re-accumulate propaganda capital for their bankrupt "detention of prisoners of war" proposition. They dispatched spies to infiltrate our area, using the neutralized Panmunjom conference area to escape back to the U.S. side, and then greatly exaggerated the situation, spreading rumors that our personnel were "abandoning Communism." On the evening of the 11th, a Kuomintang (KMT) special agent sent by the U.S. side actually drove a stolen truck of ours, rushing through Panmunjom and returning to the U.S. side under the open escort of U.S. military police.

However, the U.S. side's propaganda trick revealed too many flaws, and the result was only to prove once again to the world the true colors of the U.S. as rogues and swindlers.

In a field hospital somewhere, a reporter visited Guo Jingshun, a driver of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who was injured by the KMT agents who hijacked the truck, and learned about the details of the incident. At about 12:00 midnight on September 9, Guo Jingshun and co-driver Zhao Xizhen were driving a truck on the road from Sariwon to Kaesong. A section of the road was not very good, and the car was traveling slowly, so two armed agents climbed onto the truck without being noticed. When the truck reached the vicinity of Xingshui-ri, the agents opened fire on the driver's cab, killing co-driver Zhao Xizhen on the spot. Guo Jingshun got out of the car to prepare to fight back, but was immediately shot and fell to the ground. The agents thought he was dead, so they dragged him and Zhao Xizhen to the side of the road to hide them and stripped them of their Volunteer Army uniforms. At this time, Guo Jingshun was still somewhat conscious. He heard one agent say to the other: "The car is in our hands. Hopefully, we can safely and on schedule get back to Seoul." After that, the agents drove the truck away, and Guo Jingshun fell unconscious until he was seen by a passing vehicle the next morning and sent to the hospital for treatment.

After committing the crime, the two agents drove the car towards Kaesong and left one of them in the Kaesong area, which was obviously for another purpose. On the evening of the 11th, one agent drove the car to Panmunjom. On the highway, he injured a Chinese People's Volunteers guard, rushed into the conference area, made a hand gesture code with the U.S. military police in the conference area, and then drove into the U.S. area without hindrance.

The U.S. military police at Panmunjom obviously had prior instructions to meet the agents. The U.S. military police on guard at the border between the conference area and the U.S. position told U.S. reporters: "I could tell it was a Communist car. I saw him coming down the road at a very high speed, so I raised the roadblock to let him pass." Anyone with common sense would know that a sentinel could not allow a truck that was clearly known to be from the enemy to drive straight into their own position.

In fact, the U.S. side has been using the conference area for espionage activities for a long time. Last October, Korean child Kim Won-gi, in front of many reporters from both sides, stated the details of how he was induced and deceived by the U.S. troops, and then brought into the Kaesong neutral zone by the U.S. delegation personnel for espionage activities. This is a more prominent example. As recently as the end of July this year, another Korean boy, Xu Seha, was lured by the U.S. troops to infiltrate our area through the Panmunjom conference area to collect military intelligence, but was discovered and detained. In addition, we have several other U.S. agents in our hands who infiltrated our area through the Panmunjom conference area.

U.S. Chief Representative Harrison is obviously very enthusiastic about the U.S. espionage activities in Panmunjom. After the delegation meeting on the 12th, he shamelessly publicized the incident on the 11th to U.S. reporters. At the same time, Harrison openly stated that the U.S. side will continue to use the conference area as a transit station for special agents. He said: "If they want to come over from here, we don't care." Harrison's attempt to use a clumsy trick of agents pretending to surrender to excuse himself shows to what extent the prisoner-of-war detainers have degenerated.

### 美方利用板门店会场区进行特务活动  又一次证明了美方流氓骗子的本色

    美方利用板门店会场区进行特务活动
    又一次证明了美方流氓骗子的本色
    【新华社开城十六日电】美方在板门店又耍弄了一套新骗术，企图替他们已经破产了的扣留战俘的主张重新积累宣传资本。他们派遣特务潜至我区，利用中立化的板门店会场区逃回美方阵地，然后大事渲染，造谣说是我方人员“背弃共产主义”。十一日晚间，美方派来潜伏在我区的国民党特务居然驾驶着抢得的我方卡车一辆，冲过板门店，在美方军事警察公开接应下回到美方地区。
    但是，美方的这个宣传把戏露出了太多的破绽，其结果只是又一次向世界证明了美方流氓骗子的本色。
    在某地的一个野战医院中，记者访问了被国民党特务劫车打伤的中国人民志愿军司机郭景顺，了解了事件的经过情形。九月九日夜十二时许，郭景顺与副司机赵锡珍驾着一辆卡车在沙里院至开城的公路上行驶，中间有一段路不很好走，车行较慢，被两个武装特务爬到车上而未曾发觉。卡车开到兴水里附近，特务从车上向司机座舱开枪射击，当场打死副司机赵锡珍。郭景顺下车准备还击，也被立即打伤倒地。特务以为他已死了，就把他和赵锡珍拖到路旁隐藏起来，并且剥走了他们的志愿军军服。这时郭景顺还有些知觉，他听到一个特务对另一个说：“车子是到手了，希望能平平安安按期赶回汉城。”之后，特务就把卡车开走了，郭景顺也昏迷过去，直到第二天天明才被路过的车子看见送赴医院救治。
    两个特务在行凶以后，就驾着车子向开城方面逃走，并在开城地区留下其中一人，这显然是另有目的。十一日晚间，一个特务就驾车逃奔板门店，在公路上撞伤我中国人民志愿军警卫人员一人，夺路冲进会场区，在会场区与美方军事警察作一手势暗号后，就毫无阻碍地驶入美方地区。
    板门店的美方军事警察，显然事先曾得到接应特务的指示。在会场区与美方阵地交界处站岗的美方军事警察对美方记者说：“我可以看出那是一辆共产党的车子，我看到他用很高的速度顺路开来，我就拉起路障，让他过去。”稍有常识的人都会知道，哨兵是不可能让一辆真正明知是敌方的卡车扬长驶入自己阵地的。
    事实上，美方利用会场区进行特务活动，由来已久。去年十月，朝鲜儿童金元基，曾当着双方记者多人的面，陈述了他在美方部队的指使诱骗下，由美方代表团人员携入开城中立区进行特务活动的经过情形。这是一个比较显著的例子。近如今年七月底，又有一个朝鲜少年徐世河被美方部队诱骗，通过板门店会场区潜入我区搜集军事情报，被发觉扣留。此外，我方手中还有其他通过板门店会场区潜入我区的美方特务若干人。
    美方首席代表哈利逊显然很热中于板门店的美方特务活动。十二日的双方代表团大会以后，他就对美方记者无耻地宣扬十一日的事件。同时，哈利逊更公然表示美方将继续把会场区用作特务转运站，他说：“如果他们要从这儿过来，我们并不在乎。”哈利逊企图用特务假装投降这样的拙劣把戏来替自己解嘲，这说明了战俘扣留者已经堕落到了何种地步。
