    Beijing Municipal Maternal and Child Health Hospital Promotes Painless Childbirth Method
    To the Editor: In order to promote advanced Soviet medical experience, the Beijing Municipal Maternal and Child Health Hospital established a painless childbirth promotion team in early July this year. With the concerted efforts and dedicated research of all staff members, significant results have been achieved in just two months (98% success rate). This has made everyone more clearly aware that learning from advanced Soviet medical experience is a matter of urgency.
    The National Day is approaching, and all staff members of our hospital have pledged to promote the painless childbirth method with a revolutionary spirit, to complete more than 100 cases before the National Day, and to ensure that the promotion will be more extensive and the work will be more meticulous in the future, so that every parturient can personally experience the benefits of the painless childbirth method.
                                                                                                Lü Zhong

    北京市立妇幼保健院推行无痛分娩法
    编辑同志：北京市立妇幼保健院，为了推广苏联先进医学经验，在今年七月初旬成立了无痛分娩法推行小组。在全院工作人员同心协力和努力钻研之下，只两个月的光景，便取得了显著的成效（百分之九十八是成功的）。这使得大家更明确地认识到学习苏联先进医学经验是一件刻不容缓的事。
    国庆节快来到了，我们全院工作人员都提出保证，要以革命的精神推行无痛分娩法，要在国庆节前夕，完成一百例以上，并且保证今后要更广泛地推行，工作要作的更细腻，使每一个产妇都能切身体验到无痛分娩法的好处。　　　　　　　吕　仲
