    Welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Billions of kind-hearted people in the Asian and Pacific regions, who does not long for peace, freedom, independence, and a happy life? We do not want to be interfered with by others, nor will we interfere with the lives of others; we do not allow others to invade us, nor will we invade the territory of others. We want the people of the entire Asian and Pacific regions, regardless of political system or religious belief, to live in peace, help each other, and exchange with each other in economy and culture; we, the people of our region, and the people of the whole world, should unite and be friendly, like one big family, coming and going, working tirelessly together for our prosperous and happy life.
    Unfortunately, from East to West, the aggressors headed by the American imperialists are violating the will of good men and women all over the world, intensifying their conspiracy activities for wars of aggression, completely violating the Potsdam Agreement in Western Europe, trying to revive the Nazi forces in West Germany, and ordering the Bonn government to sign the so-called "General Treaty" and "European Defense Community Treaty"; the manufacture of large-scale killing weapons—atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons—has aroused the opposition of the people of various countries. In the East, they are delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, abusing and killing prisoners of war, openly using heinous bacteriological weapons in Korea and within our borders, indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents in North Korea, and constantly intruding into our Northeast airspace for strafing and bombing, carrying out provocations. In order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism, they have illegally concluded a one-sided "Peace Treaty with Japan," "U.S.-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty," and "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement," occupied our Taiwan, militarily interfered in the national independence and liberation movements in Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, forcibly built American military bases everywhere, and organized a "Middle East Command," etc. Such crazy aggression by the United States has seriously threatened the peace of the people of the Asian and Pacific coastal countries, making the situation in the world extremely serious. It is imperative for all good men and women to save the peace of Asia and the Pacific and the world.
    Precisely for this reason, the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was successfully held in early June this year. Representatives of various countries unanimously decided to hold a formal meeting in Beijing in late September this year, calling on all kind-hearted people along the Asian and Pacific coasts to unite, save peace, and seriously find appropriate ways to solve the following problems:
    (1) To guarantee the independence, freedom, and peace of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions, and to oppose the arms race and war preparations. To prohibit the clamor for war and the propaganda of racial hatred; to abolish all suppression of peace propaganda, and to demand freedom of the peace movement. To prohibit the use of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons; to oppose the bombing and slaughter of non-combatants and peaceful residents—to strengthen adherence to international law.
    (2) To develop equitable and mutually beneficial legitimate international economic relations and cultural exchanges, to oppose blockade and embargo, to improve people's lives, and to promote the welfare of women and children.
    (3) To oppose the resurgence of Japanese militarism and to oppose making Japan a base of aggression, in order to eliminate the serious threat to peace in the Asian and Pacific regions.
    (4) To peacefully resolve the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis and to rationally resolve all issues related to peace in the Asian and Pacific regions (including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaya, etc.).
    The preparatory meeting received a wide and enthusiastic response from the people of the Asian and Pacific regions. Telegrams inviting attendance at the peace conference poured in. In every country in the region, a widespread and in-depth mass movement to enthusiastically discuss and elect representatives has already been launched.
    The All-India Peace Council and the India Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference mobilized all national and local political parties, mass organizations, cultural groups, and people from all walks of life in India to hold general meetings, and also held "Asian Week" and "Asian Day" from August 3rd to 10th, and sent representatives including all aspects to Beijing.
    The people of Japan across the country have been mobilized, holding meetings in factories, prefectures, counties, and cities, launching discussions, and democratically electing representatives, forming a wide and in-depth mass movement.
    The broad masses of the people of Australia are working hard to elect a broadly representative delegation. Others such as Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, the United States, Canada, and various Latin American countries are all launching movements, and many countries have sent representatives to participate in the preparatory work.
    The Union Republics of the Asian part of the Soviet Union held meetings in factories, rural areas, and schools for in-depth discussions. The people of Korea and Vietnam have been even more enthusiastically supporting it. There are countless touching facts among them.
    The widespread and in-depth enthusiastic support and active preparation of the people of Asian and Pacific countries for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference strongly demonstrates that the convening of this conference is the common demand of the people of Asian and Pacific countries. At this conference, representatives representing the peace wishes of 1.6 billion people will gather together to widely exchange opinions on the current desires and common and universal demands for safeguarding peace in Asia and the Pacific and strive to seek appropriate measures for resolution. We advocate saving peace and opposing the arms race and war preparations; we advocate peaceful consultation and oppose violent means; we advocate the peaceful resolution of all international disputes, but oppose interfering in the internal affairs of any country. Peace can be saved, but it must be saved jointly by peace-loving people. Therefore, we call on peace-loving people in Asia and the Pacific, regardless of political views, regardless of religious beliefs, regardless of race or country, to elect your representatives to participate in this great Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference!
    We can foresee that the enemies of peace will carry out all kinds of obstruction and sabotage against our great peace conference, because they are the enemies of peace. They may use various means to carry out rumors, slander, instigate discord, threaten intimidation, delay obstruction, and other conspiracies and tricks. However, all these means of theirs are bound to suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the great strength of the courage and unity of the people of various countries; the iron will of the broad masses of the people of Asian and Pacific countries to yearn for and save peace is invincible, and any obstruction and sabotage will ultimately be a waste of effort.
    We, the Chinese people, have always loved peace. Today, we need peace even more to build our independent, free, and happy motherland, to make it stronger, and to make the lives of the people happier. We are very honored that this conference will be held in our capital—Beijing. Chairman Mao said:
    "Our friends are all over the world." Our people across the country are happy to see friends from more than 30 countries, warriors who defend human peace and happiness, gather in Beijing to discuss our great cause of saving peace with concerted efforts. People across the country are enthusiastically discussing it, and manpower from all aspects is concentrating on preparing to welcome this historically significant event. Many cities and villages across the country are looking forward to the arrival of our peaceful friends!
    Our conference is a conference of peace, a conference of unity, a conference for saving peace in Asia and the Pacific, eliminating the disasters of war, and seeking a path to freedom and happiness for the people. The hearts of all people in the Asian and Pacific regions are one, and that is to have peace. We must unite the will of billions of people into an iron camp and create a Great Wall to defend peace.

    迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会秘书长　刘宁一
    亚洲及太平洋区域亿万的良善的人们，谁不渴望着和平、自由、独立、幸福的生活？我们不愿受别人的干涉，也决不干涉别人的生活；我们不允许别人侵略，也决不侵略别人的国土。我们要使全亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，不分政治制度与宗教信仰，和平相处，相互帮助，在经济与文化上相互交流；我们区域的人民，全世界的人民，团结友好，有如一个大家庭一样，来来往往，共同为了我们繁荣幸福的生活而努力不休。
    不幸，从东方到西方，以美国帝国主义者为首的侵略者们，竟违背着全世界良善男女的意志，加紧其侵略战争的阴谋活动，在西欧完全违背波茨坦协定，力图复活西德的纳粹势力，命令波恩政府签订所谓“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团条约”；制造大规模杀人武器——原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器，已激起了各国人民的反对。在东方，拖延朝鲜停战谈判，虐杀战俘，公然在朝鲜及我国境内使用万恶的细菌武器，在朝鲜北部，滥肆轰炸和平居民，又不断地侵入我东北领空扫射、轰炸，进行挑衅。为了加紧复活日本军国主义，非法缔结片面“对日和约”，“美日双边安全条约”，“美日行政协定”，侵占我国台湾，军事干涉越南、马来亚、菲律宾民族独立解放运动，到处强建美国军事基地，组织“中东司令部”等。美国这样疯狂的侵略使亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民的和平受到了严重的威胁，使全世界的局面异常严重，一切良善的男女们，拯救亚洲太平洋与全世界的和平已经是迫不及待了。
    恰恰为此，今年六月初旬亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议胜利地召开了。各国代表一致决定于今年九月下旬在北京召开正式会议，号召亚洲及太平洋沿岸一切良善的人民团结起来，拯救和平，认真寻找适当办法解决下列问题：
    （一）保障亚洲及太平洋区域人民的独立、自由与和平，反对扩军备战。禁止关于战争的叫嚣及种族仇恨的宣传；取消一切对和平宣传的压制，要求和平运动的自由。禁止使用原子、细菌及化学武器；反对对于非战斗人员及和平居民的轰炸与屠杀——加强对于国际法的遵守。
    （二）发展平等互利的正当国际经济关系与文化交流，反对封锁和禁运，改善人民生活，增进妇女儿童的福利。
    （三）反对日本重新军国主义化，反对将日本作为侵略基地，以消除对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平的严重威胁。
    （四）在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题并合理地解决亚洲及太平洋区域（包括越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚等地在内）一切有关和平的问题。
    筹备会议获得亚洲及太平洋区域的人民广泛而热烈的响应。应邀出席和平会议的电报，雪片飞来，全区各个国家中，广大的人民已经展开了一个热烈讨论选举代表的广泛而深入的群众运动。
    全印和平理事会和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议印度筹备委员会动员了印度所有全国及地方的政党、群众组织、文化团体、各界人民，普遍地召开大会，而且在八月三日至十日举行了“亚洲周”及“亚洲日”并选派包括各方面的代表前来北京。
    日本全国人民已经动员起来，在各工厂、各府、各县、各城市举行会议，展开讨论，民主选举代表，形成了一个广泛的深入的群众运动。
    澳大利亚广大的人民正在为选出一个具有广泛性的代表团而努力工作着。其他如缅甸、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、美国、加拿大、拉丁美洲各国莫不展开运动，且有不少的国家纷纷派遣代表，前来参加筹
    备工作。
    苏联亚洲部分的各加盟共和国在工厂，农村，学校召开会议，深入讨论。朝鲜人民、越南人民更加热烈拥护。其中动人的事实不胜枚举。
    亚洲及太平洋各国人民对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的热烈拥护和积极筹备是如此的广泛和深入，强有力地说明了这一会议的召开是亚洲及太平洋各国人民的共同要求。在这会议上，代表着十六亿人民的和平意愿的代表们将共聚一堂，对当前保卫亚洲及太平洋和平的愿望和共同普遍要求解决的问题，广泛地交换意见并努力寻求解决的适当措施。我们主张拯救和平，反对扩军备战；我们主张和平协商，反对暴力手段；我们主张和平解决国际间的一切纠纷，但反对干涉任何国家的内政。和平可以拯救，但必须由爱好和平的人们共同起来拯救。因此，我们号召亚洲及太平洋爱好和平的人们，不分政治见解，不分宗教信仰，不分种族国家，选派出你们的代表来参加这一伟大的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议吧！
    我们可以预料到和平的敌人对于我们这伟大的和平会议，必将进行种种的阻挠和破坏，因为他们是和平的敌人。他们可以用各种手段进行造谣诬蔑，挑拨离间，威胁恐吓，留难阻碍和其他阴谋诡计。但是，他们这一切手段都一定要在各国人民勇敢和团结的伟大力量面前遭受到可耻的失败；亚洲及太平洋各国广大人民渴望并拯救和平的钢铁意志是不可战胜的，任何阻挠与破坏都终将是枉费心机。
    我们中国人民，历来是热爱和平的，在今天我们更需要和平建设我们独立、自由、幸福的祖国，使它更富强，使人民的生活更幸福。我们很荣幸，这个会议在我们的首都——北京召开。毛主席说过：
    “我们的朋友遍于全世界”，我们全国人民都高兴将要看到三十余国的朋友们，保卫人类和平与幸福的战士们会集北京，和衷共济地商量我们拯救和平的大事。全国人民在热烈地讨论着，各方面的人力在集中筹备迎接这个有历史意义的大事，全国不少的城市与乡村都在企待着我们的和平朋友们的光临！
    我们的会议是和平的会议，是团结的会议，是为拯救亚洲与太平洋和平，免除战争的灾难，为人民寻求自由幸福之路的会议。全亚洲及太平洋区域人们的心是一条，这就是要和平。我们要亿万人的意志结成钢铁一样的阵营，造成一个捍卫和平的万里长城。
