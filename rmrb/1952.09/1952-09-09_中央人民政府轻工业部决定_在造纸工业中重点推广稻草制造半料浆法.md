    Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry Decision
    Key Promotion of Rice Straw Semi-Pulp Method in the Paper Industry
    The Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry has decided to promote the rice straw semi-pulp method in the paper industry. This is a method of manufacturing pulp using rice straw and other grass fibers, created and researched by Soviet expert Comrade Vilegzhanin, based on the latest Soviet theory of plant fiber decomposition, using low-temperature impregnation and without steam pressure. To thank Comrade Vilegzhanin for his creative contribution to China's paper industry, the Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry has named this method of pulp manufacturing the "Vilegzhanin Rice Straw Semi-Pulp Method," abbreviated as the "Vilegzhanin Method."
    In the past, due to limited domestic forest resources and extremely inconvenient transportation, China's machine-made paper industry has always felt a lack of pulp. On the other hand, the large amount of rice straw and other fiber raw materials produced in China lacked scientific pulping methods and were not well utilized. The achievement of the Vilegzhanin Rice Straw Semi-Pulp Method has a very significant impact on the development of China's paper industry. It has opened up the path for China's paper industry to widely utilize various grass fiber raw materials for papermaking. The main advantages of this method are high coarse pulp yield, low alkali consumption, high tear strength of the produced paper, short pulping time, simple manufacturing process, easy-to-learn manufacturing method, and low cost.
    Since the successful trial of the rice straw semi-pulp method in the second half of last year, the Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry designated the state-owned Beijing Paper Mill to conduct experiments. After half a year of efforts by the mill's staff, they successively overcame difficulties such as uneven pulp cooking and stickiness, and the rice straw semi-pulp method has now been officially implemented.
    According to the papermaking experiments of the Beijing Paper Mill, 100% rice straw semi-pulp can be used to manufacture packaging paper, kraft paper, colored paper, poster paper, and cardboard paper, as well as various other tough papers. Currently, the Beijing Paper Mill is working hard with the help of Soviet experts to further improve and enhance working methods and strive for better results.
    The main shortcomings of rice straw semi-pulp are: rice straw nodes cannot be completely removed during the impregnation process, and grass nodes still remain after the screening machine, causing black spots in the produced paper; the pulp is not easy to bleach, and the amount of bleaching powder used is greatly increased compared to the past. If these shortcomings are overcome, rice straw semi-pulp can be used to manufacture printing paper, writing paper, and various high-grade paperboard.
    In order to promote the Vilegzhanin Rice Straw Semi-Pulp Method, the Central People's Government Ministry of Light Industry has decided to first focus on promoting it in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, utilizing the existing pulping equipment of local paper mills.
    The rice straw semi-pulp method is also applicable to grass and bamboo fiber raw materials such as wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, reeds, and bamboo. The Shanghai Jiangnan Paper Mill has recently achieved preliminary success in using raw bamboo silk to trial-manufacture semi-pulp. Various regions can promote it in a planned and step-by-step manner according to different equipment and resource conditions. (Central Light Industry Ministry Communications Group)

    中央人民政府轻工业部决定
    在造纸工业中重点推广稻草制造半料浆法
    中央人民政府轻工业部决定在造纸工业中推广稻草制造半料浆法。这是苏联专家威烈基金同志，根据苏联最新植物纤维分解作用的理论，创造研究出的一种低温浸渍、不用蒸气压力，利用稻草及其他草类纤维制造纸浆的方法。为了感谢威烈基金同志对中国造纸工业的创造性的贡献，中央人民政府轻工业部把这种制造纸浆的方法命名为“威烈基金稻草制造半料浆法”，简称“威烈基金法”。
    过去，由于国内森林资源有限，交通运输也极不方便，因此中国的机器造纸工业，历来都感纸浆缺乏。而另一方面，中国出产的大量稻草等纤维原料，又缺乏科学的造浆方法，没有很好加以利用。威烈基金稻草制造半料浆法的成就，对于中国造纸工业的发展有着非常巨大的意义。它开辟了中国造纸工业广泛利用各种草类纤维原料造纸的道路。这个方法的主要优点是粗浆收获量高，碱液用量少，所产纸张断裂长大，成浆时间短，制造程序简单，制造方法简而易学，成本也低。
    自去年下半年稻草制造半料浆法试验成功后，中央人民政府轻工业部即指定国营北京造纸厂从事实验。经该厂职工半年来的努力，陆续克服了纸浆生熟不匀和发黏等困难，目前已正式实行稻草制造半料浆法了。
    按照北京造纸厂的抄纸实验，可用百分之百的稻草半料浆制造包装纸、牛皮纸、颜色纸、招贴纸和纸盒纸等，也可制造其他各种质地坚韧的纸张。目前北京造纸厂正在苏联专家帮助下，为进一步改进和提高工作方法，争取更好的成绩而努力。
    稻草半料浆还存在着的缺点，主要是：稻草节子在浸渍过程中不能全部除去，经过筛浆机后尚残存草节，造成所产的纸张中有黑色斑点；纸浆不易漂白，漂白粉用量较过去大为提高。如克服了这些缺点，稻草半料浆可用于制造印刷纸、书写纸和各种高级纸版等。
    为了推广威烈基金稻草制造半料浆法，中央人民政府轻工业部决定首先在北京、天津、上海三地利用当地纸厂现有制浆设备，重点推广。
    稻草制造半料浆法，同样适用于麦秸、甘蔗渣、芦苇、竹子等草类及竹类纤维原料。上海江南造纸厂最近利用生竹丝试验制造半料浆，已获得初步成就。各地可以根据不同的设备和资源条件，有计划、有步骤地推广。（中央轻工业部通讯小组）
