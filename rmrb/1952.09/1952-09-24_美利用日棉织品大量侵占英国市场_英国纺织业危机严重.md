Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: Japanese cotton textile industry's fierce competition in the British market has become a serious threat to the British cotton textile industry. Under the support of the United States, the Japanese cotton textile industry, mainly using American cotton as raw material, has been restored on a large scale in recent years, and cotton textile exports have surged, most of which are exported to markets originally controlled by Britain. In the first six months of this year, not only was the total amount of cotton textiles exported by Japan more than that of Britain, but also the amount of cotton textiles exported by Japan to the Commonwealth countries far exceeded the amount exported by Britain to the Commonwealth countries. Especially in Southeast Asia, Japanese cotton textiles have massively seized the British market. Last year, Japan completely replaced Britain as the main country supplying cotton textiles to Pakistan. At the same time, Japanese cotton textiles have also invaded the British African market. In the past six months, 400 Japanese salesmen went to East Africa to sell cotton textiles.

As a result of Japanese monopoly capitalists lowering wages and cruelly exploiting textile workers, the price of Japanese cotton textiles is far lower than that of British products. British textile owners admit that Japanese cotton textiles are often priced 30% to 50% lower than British products. The low-price dumping of Japanese cotton textiles has put Britain in a difficult position to resist.

The entry of Japanese textiles into the British market is part of the United States' plan to use Japanese industry to打击 [dǎ jī - strike, hit, attack] British forces and seize the British market. This打击 [dǎ jī - strike, hit, attack] is very heavy for Britain. Britain is a country that lives by exports, and for hundreds of years, textiles—the most important of which is cotton textiles—have been one of Britain's most important exports. At a time when the entire capitalist world textile market is shrinking and the volume of textile exports is greatly reduced compared with before the war, the resurgence of the Japanese textile industry has an even greater impact on Britain.

Due to Japanese competition and the shrinking of domestic and foreign markets in Britain, the British textile industry has fallen into a serious crisis. A large number of factories have closed down or can only operate partially, and the number of unemployed workers has increased significantly. According to the British Ministry of Labour, by May of this year, the number of unemployed people in the British textile industry increased to more than 160,000, with one in every six workers unemployed, and the textile industry is facing the most severe period of depression since the war.

This situation has made British capitalists extremely alarmed. Mr. Boardman, the general manager of fourteen British textile manufacturing companies, said on September 8 with great concern: Japanese merchants are conducting a "cold war" in the African and Asian textile markets, "Japanese salesmen are ready to wipe out Lancashire (British textile industry center) overnight." He added that if Japanese textile competition cannot be restricted, the British textile industry may suffer an even more惨 [cǎn - miserable, tragic] decline than in the past fifteen months. The "Daily Express" published an editorial on the 15th saying: "This is a symptom of a disease, and if the British Empire cannot cure this disease, then it will undoubtedly perish. Now Japan is already knocking on our door."

At present, Britain is struggling to resist. The struggle between Britain and Japan and its behind-the-scenes manipulator, the United States, is intensifying. This struggle has become the main content of the International Cotton Textile Industry Conference held in Britain from September 17. According to the United Press, at this meeting, on the one hand, the British delegation "will seek measures to protect the Southeast Asian market from Japanese competition"; on the other hand, Japan, under the manipulation of the United States, requires the British side to lift restrictions so that Japanese cotton textiles can be dumped unhindered in the British Southeast Asian and African markets. Agence France-Presse, London, reported on the 15th that at this meeting, "the two major劲敌 [jìng dí - formidable opponents] in the world cotton textile trade—Japan and Britain—will engage in a real battle."

    美利用日棉织品大量侵占英国市场
    英国纺织业危机严重
    【新华社二十日讯】日本棉织业在英国市场上的剧烈竞争，已成为英国棉织工业的严重威胁。在美国扶植下，主要以美国棉花为原料的日本棉织工业在最近几年中大规模恢复起来，棉织品输出激增，其中大部分是输至原为英国所控制的市场。在今年前六个月中，不仅日本输出的棉织品总量比英国为多，而且日本向英联邦国家输出的棉织品数量也远超过英国向英联邦国家输出的数量。特别是在东南亚地区，日本棉织品大量侵占英国的市场。在去年，日本便完全代替英国而成为供给巴基斯坦棉织品的主要国家。同时，日本棉织品也侵入英国的非洲市场。在最近六个月中，有四百名日本推销员到东非推销棉织品。
    日本垄断资本家由于压低工资残酷剥削纺织工人的结果，使得日本棉织品价格远比英国出品低廉。英国纺织业主承认：日本棉织品开价往往比英国出品低百分之三十到五十。日本棉织品的低价倾销，使英国处于难以招架的境地。
    日本纺织品的打入英国市场，是美国利用日本工业以打击英国势力和夺取英国市场的计划的一部分。这种打击对于英国来说，是十分沉重的。英国是以输出为生的国家，而数百年来纺织品——其中最主要的是棉织品——一直是英国最主要的输出品之一。在目前整个资本主义世界纺织品市场日益缩小、纺织品输出贸易量比战前大大减少的情况之下，日本纺织业的重新崛起对于英国的影响就更加巨大。
    由于日本的竞争和英国国内外市场的减缩，英国纺织工业已陷入严重的危机。大批工厂倒闭或者只能部分开工，失业工人大量增加。据英国劳工部宣布，到今年五月，英国纺织工业失业人数增至十六万人以上，每六个工人中即有一个失业，纺织工业面临战后最厉害的萧条时期。
    这种情况使英国资本家极其惊慌。英国十四个纺织品制造公司的总经理鲍德曼在九月八日十分忧虑地说：日本商人已在非洲与亚洲纺织市场进行“冷战”，“日本推销员已准备好在一夜间消灭兰开夏
    （英国纺织工业中心）”。他又说，如果不能限制日本纺织品的竞争，英国纺织工业可能要遭到比过去十五个月更惨的衰落。“每日快报”十五日发表社论说：“这是一种病症的征兆，假如大英帝国不能够治好这种病，那末它无疑地必将灭亡。现在日本已经在敲我们的大门了。”
    目前，英国正在竭力挣扎，进行抵抗。英国与日本及其幕后操纵者美国之间的斗争日益激烈。这种斗争已成为九月十七日起在英国举行的国际棉织业会议的主要内容。据合众社透露，在这个会议上，一方面，英国代表团“要寻求保护东南亚市场以防止日本竞争的措施”；另一方面，在美国操纵下的日本，要求英国方面取消限制，使日本棉织品能毫无阻碍地在英国的东南亚及非洲市场倾销。法新社伦敦十五日电说：在这个会议上，“世界棉纺贸易中的两大劲敌——日本和英国——将进行一场真正的战斗。”
