Achievements of the Cooperative Movement in New China Over the Past Three Years
Cheng Zihua, Deputy Director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives

(I)

    The People's Republic of China has been established for three years, and cooperatives have developed rapidly in these three years. According to statistics for the second quarter of 1952, there are 36,482 cooperatives nationwide, with more than 100.6 million members. Among them, there are 31,953 rural supply and marketing cooperatives, with 95.46 million members, averaging 20.14 percent of the rural population; 3,340 urban consumer cooperatives, with 1.1 million members, and in the seven major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, the number of members accounts for 23.2 percent of the total population; 1,076 industrial production cooperatives, with 200,000 members; and 113 other types of cooperatives, with 108,000 members. In 1951, the total retail sales of commodities by cooperatives nationwide increased fifteenfold compared to 1949, and the total value of agricultural products purchased by cooperatives nationwide increased nineteenfold compared to 1949. There are currently 1,375 county federations, 78 city federations, 35 provincial federations, 6 greater administrative region federations, and one autonomous region federation nationwide. Cooperatives nationwide currently have more than 420,000 cadres. The cooperative economy of New China has gradually become an increasingly important component of the entire national economy, and the cooperative system has become an increasingly important new social system, which will have extremely great and bright development prospects in China.
    In the past three years, the reason why cooperatives have been able to develop so rapidly is due to the following favorable factors:
    The primary factor is the nature of our regime. Our regime is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, and it is precisely because of this that it regards the cooperative economy as an important component of the entire people's economy. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates: "The cooperative economy is an economic form of a semi-socialist nature and an important component of the entire people's economy. The People's Government should support its development and give it preferential treatment." Over the past three years, people's governments at all levels have, in accordance with this regulation, given constant attention, correct leadership, and great practical assistance to the work of cooperatives. For example, state-owned trade generally gives cooperatives a preferential rate of 2 to 6 percent on goods wholesaled to them; the interest rate on loans from the People's Bank to cooperatives is 10 percent lower than the interest rate on loans to state-owned trade; state tax authorities reduce business tax by 20 percent for cooperatives and exempt newly established cooperatives from income tax for one year; and other state departments have also given cooperatives various kinds of assistance. This policy of the People's Government to support the cooperative economy has become a huge force driving the rapid development of the cooperative cause in New China.
    The second factor is the various important measures of the People's Government. Over the past three years, the gradual completion of the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, as well as the stabilization of finance and prices, have promoted the rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, and the people's purchasing power has generally increased; in addition, the restoration and smooth flow of transportation and the development of the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas have created favorable conditions for the rapid development of cooperatives.
    Thirdly, there is the correct business policy of the cooperatives. Chairman Mao instructed us in his article "On Cooperatives": "The nature of cooperatives is to serve the masses, which means always thinking of the masses, planning for the masses, and putting the interests of the masses first. This is our fundamental difference from the Kuomintang, and it is also the starting point and destination of a communist's revolution."
    In July 1950, the National Conference of Cooperative Workers' Representatives, based on this instruction, determined the business policy of "upper-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, and grassroots cooperatives serving members." For the past two years, we have conscientiously implemented this correct policy, thus basically overcoming the capitalist profit-seeking ideology in the business operations of the cooperatives, enabling members to obtain material benefits and gaining their support.

(II)

    Currently, the cooperatives under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives mainly include the following three types: rural supply and marketing cooperatives, urban consumer cooperatives, and industrial production cooperatives.

    The first type: Rural Supply and Marketing Cooperatives

    Supply and marketing cooperatives are the main component of the current cooperative movement in China. Supply and marketing cooperatives supply members with the necessities of life and means of production at prices lower than or not higher than market prices, and at the same time, purchase members' produce at appropriate prices. It purchases members' agricultural and sideline products with one hand and supplies members with industrial products with the other, forming an organized and planned exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This practice is welcomed by farmers, and therefore the supply and marketing business of cooperatives has developed rapidly. In carrying out supply and marketing business, cooperatives also cooperated with state-owned trade to implement a reasonable price policy, which played a certain role in stabilizing prices.

    Based on the principle that trade serves production and also influences production, we have determined that supply and marketing cooperatives should serve the agricultural production process. In addition to promptly promoting the sale of members' products, supply members with means of production such as seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and pesticides in accordance with the needs of farmers in different regions and seasons, without violating agricultural time, in order to help them increase production. For example, in terms of fertilizer, cooperatives throughout the country supplied farmers with 2 million tons of various oil cakes and 300,000 tons of chemical fertilizers this year. Under normal circumstances, the total value of increased production from these fertilizers is equivalent to 5 million tons of rice or 19 million dan of seed cotton.
    Another example of supply and marketing cooperatives serving production is that cooperatives in various regions have used production and disaster relief methods to help disaster victims overcome famines. For example, in 1949, under the government's call for "production and disaster relief," cooperatives in various regions actively participated in the disaster relief movement. According to incomplete statistics from nine provinces and regions including Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Chahar, Western Liaoning, and Zhejiang, cooperatives organized disaster victims to carry out more than 200 kinds of handicrafts and sideline production, and promoted the sale of products with a total value equivalent to more than 2 billion catties of grain, maintaining the lives of approximately 10 million disaster victims for three months and helping them overcome the famine. This work greatly enhanced the prestige of supply and marketing cooperatives among farmers and laid a mass foundation for the development of cooperatives. Some supply and marketing cooperatives were established during the production and disaster relief work.

    However, the way that supply and marketing cooperatives help farmers restore and develop production is not simply to help them become wealthy, but to combine the individual interests of farmers with the overall interests of the country through each specific business activity. Based on this policy, we have adopted methods such as signing "pre-purchase contracts" and "combined contracts" with farmers, and conducting collective purchasing (farmers' collective sales) to organize business.
    "Pre-purchase" is a method in which the state orders agricultural products from farmers through supply and marketing cooperatives. Last year, cooperatives piloted cotton pre-purchase among farmers, which facilitated the work of cooperatives in purchasing cotton. From September of last year to August of this year, the cotton purchased by cooperatives has exceeded the original plan by 5 percent. This year, the state has entrusted cooperatives to pre-purchase 10 million dan of ginned cotton from cotton farmers with fertilizer loans of 1.5 trillion yuan and supplies of coal, cloth, grain, and other materials worth more than 400 billion yuan. Cooperatives have adopted the method of "credit pre-purchase" with advance payment of in-kind deposits for poor farmers to help them solve difficulties in production and life; for general farmers, they have adopted the method of "credit pre-purchase" under the condition of guaranteeing the supply of several kinds of materials that they need and are not easy to buy, in order to solve their production and living needs. So far, the pre-purchased cotton has reached 97 percent of the original plan. Since pre-purchase contracts are generally signed with organized farmers such as production mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and member groups, it also plays a role in consolidating these organizations and promoting the organization of farmers.
    "Combined contracts" are combined contracts for supply and marketing business signed between supply and marketing cooperatives and mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives guarantee the timely supply of several major necessities of life and means of production to mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives; the other party's agricultural and sideline products are also given priority to be sold to supply and marketing cooperatives under the condition of being equal to market prices. In this way, supply and marketing cooperatives can organize trade in a planned way; mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives can also reduce commercial activities in the free market and concentrate their efforts to develop production in a planned way. In this way, the signing of combined contracts is conducive to the consolidation and development of both.

    Collective purchasing (farmers' collective sales) is a method in which supply and marketing cooperatives purchase agricultural products from their members and organized farmers who have signed contracts. This method is a collective action of farmers, which can improve the purchasing efficiency of cooperatives and save farmers' time and labor. To do a good job of collective purchasing, it is necessary to first do a good job of full political work, which is one of the best forms of educating farmers to establish collective thinking to collective action.

    As seen above, rural supply and marketing cooperatives are not ordinary stores, but economic organizations that organize the exchange of industrial and agricultural products in a planned way. Through its long-term education of farmers and its long-term activities among farmers, it can gradually improve farmers' collective thinking and collective habits, and guide farmers to advance towards the road of collectivization.

    The second type: Urban Consumer Cooperatives

    Consumer cooperatives only have the task of supplying members with necessities of life, and do not have the task of promoting the sale of products or supplying means of production to members. Due to the prosperity of urban commerce, and the fact that they are generally concentrated areas of factories, there is no or very little regional price difference in industrial products, and only agricultural products such as grains, vegetables, meat, and fruits purchased from rural areas have regional price differences, so consumer cooperatives have many difficulties in business operations compared to rural supply and marketing cooperatives.
    On the other hand, the members of consumer cooperatives are mainly workers, staff members, students, and all other wage earners and handicraft laborers, who urgently require cooperatives to supply them with high-quality and low-priced goods, which is what urban consumer cooperatives must and should do.

    According to the analysis of the goods supplied by general consumer cooperatives to their members, although there are many types of goods supplied, staple foods and non-staple foods account for about 50 to 70 percent, and these goods are purchased from rural areas. As long as this important link is grasped in business operations, and methods such as purchasing from supply and marketing cooperatives in producing areas, direct allocation, and making retail stores located close to members' residential areas to facilitate members' purchases are adopted, it is still possible to run urban consumer cooperatives well. Taking the Dongsi District Federation of Beijing as an example: the prices of 21 kinds of goods such as flour, rice, salt, and apples in the first quarter of this year were on average 14.27 percent lower than the market prices, greatly reducing the intermediate exploitation suffered by members. Worker Zhang Youde in the district has a monthly salary of 700,000 yuan. Buying 500,000 yuan worth of goods in the cooperative saves him 74,500 yuan compared to buying them on the market, which is more than one-tenth of his total salary income. Another female member, Wu Shuzhen, whose husband has a monthly salary of 300,000 yuan, saves 16,000 yuan by buying 120,000 yuan worth of goods in the cooperative compared to buying them on the market, saving more than 90,000 yuan in half a year, which is more than enough to cover her child's tuition fee of 36,000 yuan for half a year. Another member is a university professor with a monthly salary of 1.2 million yuan. His family of four buys more than 1 million yuan worth of goods in the cooperative every month, saving 149,000 yuan, which allows his family to eat an extra catty of pork every day. Therefore, the relationship between urban consumer cooperatives and their members is also particularly close, and in fact it has become the housekeeper of the members.

    The third type: Industrial Production Cooperatives

    There are many handicraft laborers in China, and their production volume is very large, but the vast majority are scattered individual producers. Due to low productivity and weak capital, they suffered from excessive exploitation of commercial profits and the squeeze of machine industry in the old society, and lived a miserable life. Under the people's own regime, they have gained brilliant hope. Organizing them in the form of cooperatives, through the education of collectivism of cooperatives and the specific measures taken, can gradually improve and transform them, so that Chinese handicraftsmen can gradually transition from scattered individual production to collective workshop handicraft production, semi-machine production, and even all machine production in batches. In this way, handicraftsmen can move from poverty to a wealthy life.

    The current industrial production cooperatives can be roughly divided into two types. One is the handicraft supply and marketing production cooperative, and the other is the industrial production cooperative with collective production. In addition, there are also supply and marketing production cooperative organizations organized in the form of groups due to excessive dispersion of production. For family handicraft laborers, it is most suitable to adopt the method of uniformly distributing raw materials, purchasing their finished products, and uniformly paying appropriate wages according to the quantity and quality of the finished products, and organizing them into handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives. But it does not always stay at such a low level. Due to correct leadership, due to the increase of public accumulation and the cultivation of members' collective habits, it can be gradually upgraded to an industrial production cooperative with collective production. For example, the Gong Sheng Weaving Production Cooperative in Weifang City, Shandong Province, was composed of weavers engaged in decentralized production three years ago. However, after its formation, due to the cooperative's continuous education and transformation of its members, various reasonable management systems and welfare facilities were gradually established within the cooperative. Over the past three years, it has accumulated more than 200 million yuan in funds, installed more than 20 electric looms, and realized collective production. For general handicraftsmen, industrial production cooperatives with collective production can be organized from the beginning. For example, the Renjiayu Iron Production Cooperative in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, has accumulated 240 million yuan in public funds over the past three years, and is now able to build new factory buildings, install gas blowers, and change the original earthen furnace iron smelting to semi-mechanized small blast furnace iron smelting. Before the Anti-Japanese War, iron workers in Renjiayu Village only earned six or seven catties of rice per person per day. During the Japanese occupation, it dropped to only three or four catties of rice per person per day. In the early days of organization after liberation, the wages per person per day were also only ten catties of rice. However, after the formal establishment of the production cooperative in September 1951, it has increased to an average wage of 19,465 yuan per person per day (equivalent to more than 20 catties of rice). In the past three months, merchants have sold 250 Ningxia wool carpets in Renjiayu Village, each worth 200,000 to 500,000 yuan. Another example is the Ganhe Sulfur Production Cooperative in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, which began to organize in 1947 and was formally reorganized into a production cooperative in 1950. In recent years, due to the continuous improvement of technology, the earthen furnace sulfur smelting was changed to Lingshi small furnace sulfur smelting, which increased the output by 3.63 times, reduced the cost by 38.6 percent, and increased the average wage of members by 7.2 times. Before liberation, half of the 115 households in the village ate chaff and tree bark. Now, not only does no household worry about food and clothing, but 80 percent of the population has three sets of clothes (work clothes, casual clothes, and meeting clothes). There are 28 grandfather clocks in the whole village. Among the 228 adults, 66 have watches or pocket watches. All school-age children are enrolled in school. Seventy-three percent of young and middle-aged people participate in amateur schools, and the whole village subscribes to several newspapers. These all illustrate the superiority of industrial production cooperatives.
    The main achievement of industrial production cooperatives in the past three years is that they have begun to explore the experience of how to organize industrial production cooperatives and manage production, which has laid a solid foundation for future large-scale development.

(III)

    In the past three years, cooperatives have developed into a huge cooperative network with more than 100 million members, and have played a certain role in the people's economy. However, our work is still far behind the objective requirements. In areas where land reform has just been completed, it is still necessary to actively develop organizations and expand business. In old liberated areas, it is necessary to further improve the current work.

    We must always follow Chairman Mao's instruction: "The nature of cooperatives is to serve the masses, which means always thinking of the masses, planning for the masses, and putting the interests of the masses first." We must resolutely eliminate the purely profit-seeking viewpoint, and truly proceed from the needs of the members, not from the size of the profit. We must establish the leadership ideology of the working class, implement a broad democratic system within the cooperative system, disclose costs, improve wholesale and retail business, reduce commodity circulation levels, reduce costs, and give members more material benefits.

    We must quickly and truly learn to manage enterprises, and establish a systematic economic accounting system for cooperatives in business management. In accordance with the already stipulated financial management system, accounting system, and four fixed rates for management business (capital and commodity turnover rate, circulation cost rate, damage rate, and net profit rate), we must conscientiously implement them in order to further improve our business management technology.

    We must also strengthen the business of local industrial and handicraft products according to the needs of the vast number of members. At the same time, we must strengthen the promotion of small local products according to the needs of the vast number of farmers. Therefore, provincial and county-level federations should hold several commodity exchange meetings regularly every year in order to better meet the needs of the majority of members.

    In short, we must thoroughly correct the business management ideology of cooperatives, improve business management technology, and meet the material needs of the vast number of members more, so as to improve the current cooperative work a step further! (Xinhua News Agency)

    三年来新中国合作社运动的成就
    中华全国合作社联合总社副主任  程子华
    （一）
    中华人民共和国成立已经三年了，三年来合作社有了迅速的发展。根据一九五二年第二季度的统计，全国共有合作社三六、四八二个，社员一万万零六百余万人。其中，农村供销合作社三一、九五三个，社员九、五四六万人，平均占农村人口的百分之二十点一四；城市消费合作社三、三四○个，社员一、一○○万人，北京、天津、上海、武汉、沈阳、广州、重庆等七大城市，社员数占人口总数的百分之二十三点二；工业生产合作社一、○七六个，社员二十万人；其他种类合作社一一三个，社员一○八、○○○人。一九五一年全国合作社商品零售额较一九四九年增加十五倍，全国合作社农产品收购总值较一九四九年增加了十九倍。全国现有一、三七五个县联合社，七十八个市联合社，三十五个省联合社，六个大行政区和一个民族自治区联合社。全国合作社现有干部四十二万余人。新中国合作社经济已逐步成为整个人民经济中一种日益重要的成分，合作社制度已成为一种日益重要的新的社会制度，它在中国将有极其伟大的光明的发展前途。
    在三年中间，合作社所以能有这样迅速的发展，是因为有着以下几个有利的因素：
    首要的因素，是我们的政权的性质。我们的政权是以工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政的政权，正是因为这样，所以它把合作社经济视为整个人民经济的一个重要组成部分。在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中明确地规定：“合作社经济为半社会主义性质的经济，为整个人民经济的一个重要组成部分。人民政府应扶助其发展，并给以优待。”三年来，各级人民政府均根据这一规定，给予合作社工作以经常的关心，正确的领导和极大的实际帮助。如国营贸易向合作社批发的货物，一般给予百分之二到百分之六的优待；人民银行向合作社贷款的利率，低于向国营贸易贷款利率的百分之十；国家税务机关向合作社征税，营业税减低百分之二十，新成立的合作社一年内免征所得税；国家其他各部门也都曾给予合作社以不同的帮助。人民政府对合作社经济的这种扶助方针，成为推动新中国合作事业迅速发展的巨大力量。
    其次一个因素，是人民政府的各种重要措施。过去三年来经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命和土地改革三大运动的逐步完成，金融物价的稳定，促使工农业生产得以迅速的恢复和发展，人民购买力呈现普遍的上升；加以交通运输的恢复畅通，城乡物资交流的开展，均为合作社的迅速发展创造了有利的条件。
    第三，是合作社正确的业务方针。毛主席在“论合作社”一文中指示我们：“合作社性质，就是为群众服务，这就是处处要想到群众，为群众打算，把群众的利益放在第一位。这是我们与国民党的根本区别，也是共产党员革命的出发点和归宿。”
    一九五○年七月全国合作社工作者代表会议根据这一指示，确定了“上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务”的业务方针。两年来我们认真地执行了这一正确的方针，因而基本上克服了合作社业务经营当中的资本主义营利思想，使社员获得了物质实惠，得到了社员的拥护。
    （二）
    目前在中华全国合作社联合总社领导下的合作社，主要的有以下三种，这就是农村供销合作社、城市消费合作社和工业生产合作社。
    第一种：农村供销合作社
    供销合作社是当前中国合作社运动中的主要组成部分。供销合作社以低于市价或不高于市价的价格，供应社员以所需的生活资料和生产资料，同时按照适当的价格，收购社员的生产品。它以一只手收购社员农副业产品，同时又以另一只手供应社员以工业产品，形成了一种有组织有计划的城乡物资交流。这种作法受到农民的欢迎，因而合作社的供销业务得到迅速的发展。在进行供销业务中，合作社也配合国营贸易，贯彻了合理的价格政策，对于稳定物价起了一定的作用。
        根据贸易为生产服务、同时又影响生产的原则，我们确定了供销合作社为农业生产过程服务的方针。除及时地推销社员的产品外，按照不同地区农民不同季节的需要，不违农时地供应社员以种籽、肥料、农具、农药等生产资料，以帮助他们提高产量。如肥料一项，今年全国各地合作社供应农民的各种饼肥达二百万吨、化学肥料达三十万吨。这些肥料在正常情况下，其增产总值相当于五百万吨稻谷或一千九百万担籽棉。
    供销合作社另一件为生产服务的事例，是各地合作社曾经用生产救灾的办法，帮助灾民度过了灾荒。如一九四九年各地合作社在政府“生产救灾”的号召下，积极地参加了救灾运动。仅据苏南、苏北、皖北、河北、平原、山东、察哈尔、辽西、浙江等九个省区不完全的统计，合作社共组织灾民进行了二百余种手工业、副业生产，为灾民推销产品总值合二十余亿斤粮食，维持了约一千万灾民三个月的生活，度过了灾荒。这一工作大大地提高了供销合作社在农民中间的威信，为合作社的发展打下了群众基础，若干供销合作社就是在生产救灾工作中建立起来的。
        然而，供销合作社帮助农民恢复和发展生产，并不是单纯帮助他们发家致富，而是通过每件具体业务活动，把农民的个体利益和国家整体利益结合起来。根据这一方针，我们采取了与农民订立“预购合同”、“结合合同”和向农民进行集体收购
    （农民集体出售）等方式，组织了业务。
        “预购”是国家经过供销合作社向农民订购农产品的一种方式。去年合作社曾在农民中试办了棉花预购，因而便利了合作社的收购棉花工作。从去年九月到今年八月，合作社收购的棉花已超过原计划的百分之五。今年国家又以一万五千亿元肥料贷款和四千余亿元的煤、布、粮等物资，委托合作社向棉农预购一千万担皮棉。合作社对贫苦农民采取了预付实物订金的“赊销预购”的办法，帮助他们解决生产和生活上的困难；对于一般农民，则在保证供应他们所需而又不易购买到的若干种物资的条件下，采取“信用预购”的办法，以解决他们生产上和生活上的需要。到目前为止，预购的棉花，已达原计划百分之九十七。由于预购合同一般是与生产互助组、农业生产合作社和社员小组等有组织的农民订立的，因而也就起了巩固这些组织的作用，并促进了农民组织起来。
        “结合合同”是供销合作社与互助组、农业生产合作社之间订立的供销业务的结合合同。供销合作社对于几种主要的生活资料和生产资料，保证及时地供应互助组、农业生产合作社；对方的农业和副业产品，在等于市场价格条件下，也优先卖给供销合作社。这样，供销合作社可以有计划地组织贸易；互助组、农业生产合作社也可以减少自由市场的商业活动，集中力量，按照计划，放手地发展生产。这样，结合合同的订立就有利于两者的巩固和发展。
    集体收购（农民集体出售）是供销合作社向自己的社员和订有合同的有组织的农民收购农产品的一种方式。这种方式是农民的集体行动，可以提高合作社的收购效率，节省农民的时间和人力。要作好集体收购，必须先作好充分的政治工作，这是从教育农民树立集体思想到集体行动的最好的形式之一。
    如上看来，农村供销合作社不是一般的普通商店，而是有计划地组织工业品与农产品交换的经济组织。经过它对农民的长期的教育和在农民中间长期的活动，就可以逐步地提高农民的集体思想和集体习惯，引导农民向着合作化的道路前进。
        第二种：城市消费合作社
    消费合作社只有供应社员生活资料的任务，没有给社员推销产品和供应生产资料的任务。由于城市商业繁荣，一般又是工厂集中之地，工业品没有或很少有地区差价，只有由农村采购来的粮食、菜蔬、肉、水果等农产品才有地区差价，所以消费合作社比较农村供销合作社在业务经营上是有许多困难的。
    在另一方面，消费合作社的社员主要是工人、职员、学生以及其他一切工资生活者和手工业劳动者，他们迫切要求合作社供给以物美价廉的商品，这又是城市消费合作社必须而且应该作到的。
    根据一般消费合作社供应社员商品的分析，供应的种类虽多，但主食和副食品要占百分之五十到七十左右，这些商品是由农村采购来的。只要在业务经营上抓住这一重要环节，采取向产地供销合作社采购，直线调拨，以及使零售店的设置接近社员居住地区，给社员购买以方便等办法，仍然是能够把城市消费合作社办好的。以北京市东四区联合社为例：今年第一季度的面粉、大米、盐、苹果等二十一种商品的价格，平均低于市场价格百分之十四点二七，大大减轻了社员所受的中间剥削。该区工人张有德每月工资七十万元，在合作社买五十万元的东西，可比到市场去购买节省七万四千五百元，超过他全部工资收入的十分之一。另一女社员吴淑珍，她的丈夫每月工资三十万元，在合作社购货十二万元，可比在市场购买节省一万六千元，半年节省了九万多元，供给她的一个小孩半年学费三万六千元还有余。又有一个社员系大学教授，每月薪水一百二十万元，全家四口人，每月在合作社买货一百多万元，节省十四万九千元，可以使他全家每天多吃一斤猪肉。因此，城市消费合作社与社员的关系，也表现得特别亲切，实际上它成了社员的管家人。
    第三种：工业生产合作社
    中国的手工业劳动者很多，生产量很大，但绝大多数是分散的个体生产者。由于生产力低，资金弱，在旧社会他们遭受着过重的商业利润的剥削和机器工业的排挤，过着悲惨的生活。在人民自己的政权之下，他们才获得了灿烂的希望。用合作社的形式将他们组织起来，经过合作社集体主义的教育和所采取的具体措施，就能够逐步提高他们、改造他们，从而使中国的手工业者由分散的个体生产，一批一批地逐步地过渡到集体的工场手工业生产、半机器生产、以至全部机器生产，这样，手工业者就能够由贫困的境地走向富裕的生活。
    目前的工业生产合作社大体可分为两种类型。一种是手工业供销生产合作社，一种是集体生产的工业生产合作社。此外也有由于生产过分分散，而以小组形式组织起来的供销生产合作社组织。对于家庭手工业劳动者，最适合于采取统一发给原料、收购其成品、根据成品的数量和质量统一付给适当的工资的办法，组织为手工业供销生产合作社。但它并不永远停留在这样的低级阶段，由于正确的领导，由于公共积累的增加和社员集体习惯的养成，就可以逐步提高为集体生产的工业生产合作社。如山东潍坊市工胜织布生产合作社，三年前是由分散生产的织布者组成的，但组成后由于合作社对社员不断的教育改造，社内逐步建立了各种合理的管理制度和福利设施，三年来积累了二亿多元资金，安装了二十多台电动织布机，实现了集体生产。对于
    一般手工业者，开始就可以组织集体生产的工业生产合作社。如山西阳泉市任家峪铁业生产合作社，三年来积累了二亿四千万元公有资金，现在已能建造新厂房，安装煤气鼓风机，改换原有土炉炼铁为半机械化的小高炉炼铁了。任家峪村铁业劳动者抗战前每人每天只挣六、七斤米，日本统治时期降到每人每天只能挣三、四斤米，解放后组织起来的初期每人每天工资亦只有十斤米，但到一九五一年九月正式成立生产合作社后，已增加为每人每天平均工资一九、四六五元了（合米二十余斤）。近三个月来，商人在任家峪村销售了二百五十块宁夏毛毯，每块价值二十万至五十万元。又如山西阳泉市甘河硫磺生产合作社，一九四七年开始组织起来，一九五○年正式改组为生产合作社，几年来由于不断的改进了技术，把土炉炼磺改为灵石小炉炼磺，使产量提高了三点六三倍，成本降低百分之三十八点六，社员平均工资增加七点二倍。该村一百一十五户中，解放前半数吃糠和树皮，现在不仅没有一户愁吃愁穿，而且百分之八十的人口有三套衣服（工作服、家常服、和开会服），全村有二十八台座钟，二百二十八个成年人中六十六人有手表或怀表，全部学龄儿童都入了学，青壮年百分之七十三参加了业余学校，全村并订有几份报纸。这些都说明了工业生产合作社的优越性。
    工业生产合作社三年来的主要收获，是开始摸索出了如何组织工业生产合作社和管理生产的经验，这一经验给今后大发展打下了坚实的基础。
    （三）
    三年来，合作社已经发展成为一个拥有一万万多社员的庞大的合作社网，并且在人民经济中已经起着一定的作用了。但我们的工作还远落后于客观的要求。在新完成土地改革的地区，还需要积极地发展组织，扩大业务。在老解放区，则需要进一步提高当前的工作。
    我们必须时时刻刻地遵循毛主席：“合作社性质，就是为群众服务，这就是处处要想到群众，为群众打算，把群众的利益放在第一位”的指示，坚决肃清单纯营利观点，切实从社员的需要出发，而不是从利润大小着眼；树立工人阶级的领导思想，在合作社系统内实行广泛的民主制度，公开成本，改善批发和零售业务，减少商品流转层次，降低成本，给社员以较多的物质实惠。
    我们必须迅速地真正学会管理企业，建立合作社在经营管理上的系统的经济核算制度；根据已经规定的财务管理制度、会计制度和管理业务的四项定率（资金和商品周转率、流通费用率、伤耗率、纯利率），认真地加以贯彻，以期进一步提高我们的经营管理技术。
    我们也还必须根据广大社员的需要，加强对地方工业和手工业产品的经营工作；同时也根据广大农户的需要，加强对小宗土产的推销工作。因此省县两级联合社，应当每年定期地召开几次物资交流会议，以期更好地满足多数社员的需求。
    总之，我们要彻底端正合作社业务的经营思想，提高业务的经营技术，更多地满足广大社员的物资需要，把目前的合作社工作提高一步！  （新华社）
