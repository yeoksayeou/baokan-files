Xinhua News Agency, September 24th:

    The U.S. delegation attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference issued the following written statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters upon arriving at Beijing Airport on the 24th:
    We, the representatives of the United States, have come to Beijing on behalf of American peace leaders who have not received government permission to travel abroad, and on behalf of the American people, to speak for all those who desire peaceful trade and friendship with the people of all countries but are forced to remain silent. The American people eagerly look forward to maintaining a strong friendship with the Chinese people and their democratic government.
    We will do our utmost to bring back the truth to all good people in the United States, who are still unaware of the great progress made by the Chinese people and the determination of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to create conditions for lasting world peace.
    The China Peace Committee believes that the aspirations of the American people should be accommodated by this historically significant Pan-Asian Peace Conference, and we are deeply moved by this generous sympathy.
    We have come to Beijing in a spirit of faithfulness to the principle of equality among all nations. We know that goodwill and the spirit of negotiation can overcome the warmongers. We pay high respect and deep sympathy to the liberation movements of all Asia.
    The fact that we, American citizens, have been invited to gather with representatives of Asian countries to discuss ways to achieve lasting peace gives us hope that the people of the United States will recognize the great goodwill of the Chinese people and their new government.
    We, the American representatives, firmly believe that this Pan-Asian conference will become an instrument for realizing the wishes of the peoples of the Pacific countries, so that the Korean War can be stopped, the military preparations of Japan can be abolished, and the people of Asia can have their full and equal representation in the United Nations.

    美代表团的书面谈话
    【新华社二十四日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的美国代表团，二十四日在抵达北京飞机场时，向新华社记者发表书面谈话如下：
    我们美国的代表来到北京，是代表没有得到政府出国许可的美国和平领袖，是代表美国人民，为所有期望与各国人民进行和平贸易与保持友谊而被迫不能表示意见的人们说话的。美国人民非常热切地盼望着与中国人民及其民主政府保持牢固的友谊。
    我们将竭尽自己的力量将事实真象带回给美国所有善良的人民，他们现在还不知道中国人民所获得的伟大的进步，也不知道中国政府与中国人民要为世界持久和平创造条件的意志。
    中国和平委员会认为美国人民的愿望，应为这次有历史意义的全亚洲和平会议所容纳，这种慷慨的同情使我们深为感佩。
    我们是以忠实于各民族一律平等的原则的精神来到北京的。我们知道：善意和谈判的精神是能够战胜战争制造者的。我们以崇高的敬意和深切的同情向全亚洲的解放运动致敬。
    我们美国公民被邀请来与亚洲各国人民的代表共聚一堂，商讨达到持久和平的办法，这件事实给了我们以希望，相信我们美国的人民将会认识到中国人民及其新政府的伟大的善意。
    我们美国代表深信：这次全亚洲的会议将成为实现太平洋各国人民的意愿的工具，而使朝鲜战争得以停止，日本的军备得以废除，亚洲的人民能在联合国中有其充分的平等的代表权。
