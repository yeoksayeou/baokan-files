Publishing Work Serves the Broad Masses of the People
Hu Yuzhi, Director of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration

Under the glorious illumination of the great Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, the people's publishing cause in the new China has shown a completely different new face from the past. In the past three years, along with the progress of our country and society in all aspects, the publication of books and periodicals has been continuously improving in quality and increasing by leaps and bounds in quantity.

The publication of the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" on October 12, 1951, was a major event in the political life of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and a major event in the cause of Marxism-Leninism. On that morning, in major cities across the country, long lines of readers of different ethnic groups, classes, occupations, and ages lined up in front of Xinhua bookstores, eagerly and excitedly awaiting the distribution of the works of the great leader of the Chinese people. They said: If I buy this book, I will be as happy as if I had personally met Chairman Mao.

3,020,000 copies of the first and second volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" have been printed. This quantity still cannot meet the needs of the vast number of readers, and the popular edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is currently being printed in large quantities. In addition, Chairman Mao's works have been published in minority languages ​​in China, including Mongolian, Uyghur, and Kazakh.

It was more than 30 years ago that the Chinese began to find Marxism. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." However, it was only after the national liberation that all kinds of intellectuals and working people in China could universally, widely, and systematically study this only correct revolutionary theory as a weapon for ideological transformation. In the past three years, the central and local state-owned people's publishing houses alone have published a total of 48 kinds of classic works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, with a total of 3,686,000 copies distributed. In addition, the number of Marxist-Leninist works published by various public and private publishing houses and by the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House in Chinese in China far exceeds the above number.

Publishing work now truly serves the broad masses of the people. Books are no longer the exclusive property of a few idle classes, but the spiritual food urgently needed by the vast working people and revolutionary cadres. The large increase in the number of books and periodicals published and distributed after liberation is clear evidence. In the year with the highest publication figures before liberation (1936), the total number of books published throughout the year was about 178.8 million copies, and the number of periodicals was about 32.2 million copies. After liberation, in 1950, the total number of books published throughout the year was 274,633,630 copies, and the number of periodicals was 35,301,679 copies; by 1951, the total number of books published throughout the year had increased to 669,639,911 copies, and the number of periodicals had increased to 176,774,253 copies. It is estimated that 886 million books will be published throughout the year in 1952, which is about five times the highest year before liberation; 180 million periodicals, which is about five and a half times the highest year before liberation. Before liberation, the average number of copies of each book published, excluding textbooks, was 2,000. In 1951, the average number of copies of the first edition of each book, excluding textbooks, was 9,782, which was about five times that before liberation. In 1951, the "Popular Illustrated Edition of the Marriage Law" was printed in 11.5 million copies, the "Popular Illustrated Edition of Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" was printed in 10.68 million copies, "The Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" was printed in 2.8 million copies, and "A Brief History of the Chinese Communist Party in Comic Strips" was printed in 2.5 million copies. Among the periodicals, the "Current Affairs Handbook", which has the largest sales volume, had a maximum circulation of 3,543,000 copies in one issue in 1951. This huge circulation is unimaginable before liberation. This situation shows that the people's cultural life has greatly improved after liberation, and it also shows that the readership of books and periodicals has expanded many times compared with before liberation.

    The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that our country should "Develop the people's publishing cause, and pay attention to publishing popular books and newspapers that are beneficial to the people." The publishing work in the past three years has developed in this direction. Popular reading materials for workers, peasants, and soldiers for political, cultural, and production education account for a large proportion of the total number of publications. The vast majority of popular reading materials adopt old national forms such as comic strips, singing books, almanacs, and New Year pictures, and inject new content that is beneficial to the people and combined with the actual needs of the country. Therefore, they are most loved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past three years, democratic construction, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and production and construction have achieved great victories, and popular books and newspapers have played a certain role in publicity and education.

After the national liberation, especially after the completion of the land reform in the rural areas, the number of primary and secondary schools has increased dramatically, and the number of students has reached the highest point in Chinese history. There are currently about 50 million primary and secondary school students in the country, and the supply of their textbooks is another extremely large task. Since 1951, all textbooks for primary and secondary schools across the country have adopted a unified version, which is compiled and printed uniformly by the state-owned People's Education Publishing House, and distributed uniformly by the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore according to a unified pricing. The number of textbooks issued for primary and secondary schools in spring and autumn increased from 153,949,314 copies in 1950 to 306,230,000 copies in 1952, an increase of 90%. Textbooks used in adult literacy schools and industrial and agricultural spare-time schools are not included in the calculation.

The promotion of the quick literacy movement and the launch of the illiteracy elimination movement have put forward a very arduous new task for publishing workers. In the second half of 1952 alone, 270,320,000 copies of textbooks and reading materials for winter schools and adult literacy classes need to be supplied. Due to the success of Qi Jianhua's Chinese language teaching method experiment, we can foresee that in the next few years, the readers of books and newspapers will no longer be calculated in millions or tens of millions, but in hundreds of millions. Without the spiritual and material assistance of the Soviet Union, it is impossible to imagine that the Chinese revolution would have achieved great victories. Studying the Soviet Union and learning from the advanced experience of socialism has now become a nationwide upsurge. What is reflected in the publishing industry is that Chinese translations of Soviet political, economic, literary, and scientific works are warmly welcomed by the vast number of readers. In particular, after the national liberation, although a huge number of Soviet Marxist theory, literary works, and scientific works have been published, they still cannot meet the needs of readers in all aspects. As my country's large-scale economic construction is about to begin and university education has been reformed, we urgently need to translate and introduce a large number of advanced Soviet scientific theories and technical works to replace the long-corrupted higher education books copied from the British and American bourgeoisie. Translators must make greater efforts in this regard in the future.

The works of famous modern Chinese writers and true reports about the new China have met readers in various countries around the world for the first time through publications in various languages ​​and have been welcomed by progressive people from all countries. According to incomplete statistics, the Foreign Languages Press has published 80 kinds of works in Russian, French, English, German, Indonesian, Arabic, and Esperanto in the past three years, and distributed 910,162 copies to 66 countries around the world. In addition, various major periodicals published in foreign languages ​​- "People's China", "People's Pictorial", and "China Construction" - have a large readership abroad.

All this new people's publishing cause was built on the ruins left by the collapse of the reactionary rule three years ago. The publication, printing, and distribution of books and periodicals have now become important state-owned enterprises. There are 62 state-owned publishing houses belonging to the central government and local governments. Among them, those with a certain scale and complete editing institutions are the People's Publishing House, the People's Education Publishing House, the People's Literature Publishing House, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, the Foreign Languages Press, the Workers' Publishing House, and the Youth Publishing House. The state-owned Xinhua Bookstore has established 1,086 branches across the country. The state-owned International Bookstore has now become a professional distribution agency for importing and exporting books and periodicals. Twelve state-owned book and periodical printing factories with modern scale have been established in major cities across the country.

In the past three years, the publishing, printing, and distribution industries operated by private capital have mostly recovered and developed in accordance with the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests. Some of them have undergone production reorganization and adopted the principles of joint operation, public-private joint ventures, and specialized division of labor, gradually correcting and correcting the crude and speculative style left over from the old society. Private publishing still plays a certain role in the publication of literary and natural science books, various reference books, popular reading materials, and children's books.

Our country was established not long ago, large-scale industrial construction has not yet begun, material conditions are lacking, most authors and readers have not been well organized, and there is very little work experience. Therefore, there are still some difficulties and shortcomings in publishing work, and it cannot fully meet the hopes and requirements of the broad masses of the people. After the past three years of recovery and development, in order to welcome and cooperate with the country's large-scale construction, the future publishing work needs to further improve quality, enrich content, and strengthen organization and planning in order to better serve the people.

Just like in all aspects of our country's work, in publishing work, the struggle is fierce and the task is arduous. However, the Chinese people have endless power, and it is certain that the publishing cause, as one of the causes of the Chinese people, will victoriously move towards an infinitely developing future.

    出版工作为广大人民群众服务
    中央人民政府出版总署署长  胡愈之
    在伟大的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的光辉照耀之下，新中国的人民出版事业显出了和过去完全不同的新面目。三年以来，伴随着我们国家和社会各方面的进步，图书期刊的出版，质量方面在不断地提高，数量方面在飞跃地增进。
    一九五一年十月十二日“毛泽东选集”第一卷的出版，是中国共产党和中国人民政治生活中的重大事件，是马克思、列宁主义事业中的重大事件。这一天清早，在全国各大城市，新华书店门前，排着不同民族、不同阶层、不同职业和不同年龄的读者的长行列，热烈兴奋地等待着中国人民伟大领袖的著作的发行。他们说：要是我买到了这本书，就像亲自见到了毛主席一样地高兴。
    “毛泽东选集”第一、二两卷印行了三百零二万册。这个数量还不能满足广大读者的要求，普及本的“毛泽东选集”目前正在大量印制中。此外，毛主席著作用国内少数民族文字分篇出版的有蒙古文、维吾尔文和哈萨克文等译本。
    中国人开始找到马克思主义是三十余年以前的事。正如毛泽东主席所说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”。但是全中国各种知识分子和劳动人民，普遍地、广泛地、有系统地学习这唯一正确的革命理论，作为思想改造的武器，只有在全国解放之后，才有可能。在最近的三年间，单是由中央及地方国营人民出版社出版的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的经典著作共四十八种，发行了三百六十八万六千册。此外各公私营出版社所出版的以及由苏联外国文书籍出版局出版的中文本马克思列宁主义著作在中国发行的数量，大大超过了上列的数目。
    出版工作现在已经真正为广大的人民群众服务。书籍不再是少数有闲阶级的专有品，而是广大的劳动人民和革命干部所迫切需要的精神食粮了。解放后书刊出版发行数字的大量增高，就是明显的证据。解放前出版数字最高的年份（一九三六年），全年出版书籍约为一万万七千八百万册，期刊约为三千二百二十万册。解放以后，一九五○年全年出版书籍二万万七千四百六十三万三千六百三十册，期刊三千五百三十万一千六百七十九册；到了一九五一年，全年出版书籍增加到六万万六千九百六十三万九千九百一十一册，期刊增加到一万万七千六百七十七万四千二百五十三册。一九五二年预计全年出版书籍八万万八千六百万册，约为解放前最高年份的五倍；期刊一万万八千万册，约为解放前最高年份的五倍半。解放以前，除课本外每种书籍平均发行数量为两千册，一九五一年除课本外每种书籍初版发行数量平均为九千七百八十二册，约为解放前的五倍。一九五一年发行数最多的“婚姻法图解通俗本”印行一千一百五十万册，“惩治反革命图解通俗本”印行一千零六十八万册，“中国共产党的三十年”印行二百八十万册，“中国共产党简史连环画”印行二百五十万册。期刊中销数最大的“时事手册”，在一九五一年发行最多的一期为三百五十四万三千册。这种庞大的发行数量是解放以前所不能想像的。这种情况说明了解放以后人民的文化生活大大提高，同时也说明了书籍期刊的读者群已经比解放前扩大了许多倍。
        “中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”规定：我们的国家要“发展人民出版事业，并注重出版有益于人民的通俗书报。”三年来的出版工作按着这个方向发展，供工人、农民、士兵的政治、文化、生产教育之用的通俗读物，在出版物的总册数中占着很大的比率。极大部分的通俗读物，采取连环画册、唱本、通书、年画等旧的民族形式，注入了有益于人民的和国家实际需要相结合的新内容，因此，最为广大的工农兵群众所喜爱。三年来民主建政、抗美援朝、生产建设取得伟大的胜利，通俗书报起了一定的宣传教育作用。
    全国解放之后，特别是农村完成了土地改革之后，中小学校大量增加，就学人数达到中国历史上未曾有过的最高点。全国现有约五千万的中小学生，他们所用的课本的供应，是另一件极其庞大的工作。从一九五一年起，全国初等中等学校的课本，全部采取统一的版本，由国营人民教育出版社统一编印，并按照统一的定价，由国营新华书店统一发行。春秋两季中小学课本的发行数量，从一九五○年的一万万五千三百九十四万九千三百一十四册，增加到一九五二年的三万万零六百二十三万册，即增加了百分之九十。成人补习学校和工农业余学校用的课本，还没有计算在里面。
    速成识字运动的推行和扫除文盲运动的展开，向出版工作者提出了一个十分艰巨的新任务。单在一九五二年下半年，就要供给冬学和成人识字班用的课本和读物二万万七千零三十二万册。由于祁建华语文教学法试验的成功，我们预想得到，在今后数年之内，书籍报刊的读者将不能再用百万、千万来计算，而要用万万来计算了。没有苏联精神上与物质上的援助，不能设想中国革命取得伟大的胜利。学习苏联、学习社会主义的先进经验，现已成为普遍于全国的热潮，表现在出版事业方面的是：苏联政治、经济、文艺、科学著作的中译本，受到了广大读者的热烈欢迎。特别是苏联的马克思主义理论、文学作品、科学著作，在全国解放以后，虽然出版了巨大的数量，还是不能满足各方面读者的需求。由于我国大规模的经济建设即将到来，大学教育已经进行课程改革，我们迫切需要大量地翻译和介绍苏联的先进的科学理论和技术著作，以代替从英美资产阶级抄袭来的久已腐朽的高等教育用书。翻译工作者今后必须在这一方面作更大的努力。
    现代中国著名作家的作品和关于新中国的真实报道，通过各种文字的出版物，第一次和世界各国的读者见面，并且受到各国进步人士的欢迎。据不完全的统计，外文出版社在过去三年中，用俄、法、英、德、印尼、阿拉伯文和世界语，出版了八十种著作，向全世界六十六个国家发行了九十一万零一百六十二册。此外，用外文出版的各种主要期刊——“人民中国”、“人民画报”、“中国建设”，在国外拥有广大的读者群。
    所有这一切新的人民出版事业是在三年以前反动统治崩溃以后所遗留的废墟上建设起来的。书刊的出版、印刷和发行，现在已成为重要的国营企业。属于中央和地方的国营出版社，全国共有六十二家，其中具有一定的规模和完整的编辑机构的，是人民出版社、人民教育出版社、人民文学出版社、人民美术出版社、外文出版社、工人出版社和青年出版社。国营新华书店在全国建立了分支店一千零八十六所。国营国际书店现在成为进出口书刊的专业发行机构。全国主要城市已经建立了现代规模的国营书刊印刷工厂十二家。
    私人资本经营的出版、印刷、发行业，三年以来按照公私兼顾的政策，大部分恢复，并且有了发展。其中有一部分已经经过生产改组，采取了联合经营、公私合营和分工专业化的方针，逐步纠正了并在纠正着从旧社会遗留下来的粗制滥造的投机作风。在文艺和自然科学书籍、各种工具书、通俗读物、少年儿童读物等的出版方面，私营出版业仍然起一定的作用。
    我们国家建立不久，大规模工业建设还没有开始，物质条件缺乏，大多数的著作者、读者还没有很好地组织起来，工作经验还很少，因此，出版工作中还存在着一些困难和缺点，还不能完全满足广大人民群众的希望和要求。经过过去三年的恢复与发展之后，为了迎接和配合国家的大规模建设，今后出版工作需要更进一步地提高质量、丰富内容，加强组织性和计划性，以求更好地为人民群众服务。
    正像在我们国家各方面的工作一样，在出版工作中，战斗是猛烈的，任务是艰巨的。但是中国人民有无穷无尽的力量，作为中国人民事业之一的出版事业，将要胜利地走向无穷无尽的发展前途，是可以肯定的。（新华社）
