    Housewife Zhong Bilin Finds Employment
    Editor: I am a woman with a high school education. Seven years ago, I left school, got married, and became a "virtuous wife and loving mother," a parasite. Before liberation, I dared not think that I had any truly independent personality. I could only endure being discriminated against and despised. After Chairman Mao came, I gained true equality and freedom. Under the education of the new society, I began to realize that I should not live only for a family, but should live for more people. So I decided to step out of the family. Last year, when my third child still needed breastfeeding, I was admitted to the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China. As a result, I was assigned to work in a place relatively far from home. Because the problem of breastfeeding the child could not be solved, I gave up the job. I was very depressed. In fact, I was overemphasizing my personal difficulties. Fortunately, encouraged by my lover, I persisted in reading books on ideological remolding and improving political awareness, and also went to an accounting school to study cost accounting and other things. On the other hand, I registered for job seeking with the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau. Afterwards, the Labor Bureau notified me several times to participate in work, but I still didn't go because the area was not satisfactory. I became uneasy again and complained that the People's Government was not taking care of me. After seeing the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" by the Central People's Government Government Administration Council on August 4th, on August 6th, I re-registered for job seeking with the Civil Affairs Section of the Sixth District People's Government of Beijing Municipality. How fast! On August 12th, I received a notice to participate in the staff recruitment examination of the People's Education Publishing House. I passed the exam and was assigned to work in the Finance Section of the People's Publishing House. The work location is very close to my home. On August 20th, I started working. The veteran comrades welcomed me and cared for me. They took care of me meticulously in work, life, and even singing and dancing during rest. I am extremely happy. It truly makes me feel like I have gone from a small family to a revolutionary big family, and the joy of being in a big family cannot be found in a small family. My heart is active, and my limbs are also active. Although I am already the mother of three children, I walk with great energy. I want to shout loudly at any time: It is so beautiful to be working in the Mao Zedong era!
    Editor, please convey my employment experience and the joyful mood after employment to the many housewife sisters who are preparing for employment.

    家庭妇女锺碧林劳动就业了
    编辑同志：我是一个有高中文化程度的妇女，七年前离开学校，便结了婚，一直做着“贤妻良母”，当寄生虫。解放前，我不敢想到自己有什么真正独立的人格，被人歧视、鄙弃时，也只有忍受。毛主席来后，我有了真正的平等、自由；在新社会的教育下，我开始认识到我生活着不应该只为了一个家庭，而应该为了更多的人，于是我决心走出家庭。去年，在我的第三个孩子还需要哺乳的时候，我考入了中国人民银行北京市分行。结果，我被分配在离家比较远的地方工作，因孩子的哺乳问题无法解决，便放弃了工作。我非常颓丧。其实，是我太强调个人困难了。幸好在我爱人的鼓舞下，我坚持着看一些有关思想改造和提高政治认识的书，还去一个会计学校学了成本会计等类的东西。另一方面向北京市人民政府劳动局作了求职登记。之后，劳动局曾经几次通知我参加工作，但还是因为地区不如意，我仍然没有去。我也又不安心起来，并且埋怨人民政府太不照顾我了。八月四日，我看到中央人民政府政务院“关于劳动就业问题的决定”后，八月六日，我又向北京市第六区人民政府民政科重作了求职登记。可快呀，八月十二日我接到通知了，要我去参加人民教育出版社招考工作人员的考试。我考取了，分配我到人民出版社财务科工作，工作地点离我家很近。八月二十日，我上班了。老同志们欢迎我，关心我，工作上、生活上，甚至休息时的唱歌、跳舞等等，都关照得无微不至。我愉快极了。真使我感到是由小家庭到了革命的大家庭，而在大家庭的这种愉快是在小家庭找不到的。我的心活跃起来，我的四肢也活跃起来；虽然我已经是三个孩子的母亲，我走起路来可精神。我随时都想高声喊：在毛泽东时代工作着，多美丽啊！
    编辑同志，请你把我这就业经过，就业后的愉快情绪，传达给许许多多正在准备就业的家庭妇女姊妹们。
