We Are All One Family
Editor's Note: The author of this article, Wei Hexiang, is a revolutionary soldier. He had no schooling in the past, but after the army launched a literacy campaign, he learned to write. This article is based on his personal experiences. Yang Yongqin, a revolutionary soldier's family member from Tian Si Village, First District, former Wanping County, went to Tangshan on August 6th. When she passed through Huangcun Town, Third District, Daxing County, she suddenly had a stomach ache and developed dysentery. In Huangcun, she had no relatives or friends. How could she cope with being sick on the road alone? She was uncomfortable and worried, at her wit's end.

At this time, Wang Xiurong, the women's director of Sanjie, saw her on the road and immediately helped her to the district government. The district head, after learning about the situation, sent someone to get a doctor and told Wang Xiurong, "She is a revolutionary soldier's family member. Find a house for her on the street and take good care of her." Wang Xiurong said without hesitation, "She can stay at my house." Soon, a doctor named Liu arrived. He carefully diagnosed her, asked about her condition, and found that Yang Yongqin was already nine months pregnant and had developed dysentery, which was a serious situation. Doctor Liu wrote a prescription, got the medicine, and repeatedly told Wang Xiurong to take good care of the patient, saying, "I'll come back to see her later."

Wang Xiurong and her neighbor, Aunt Zhang, carefully helped the patient into her home and settled her on their kang (heated brick bed). The two of them fetched water, cooked meals, and disposed of waste, constantly busy. Wang Xiurong didn't close her eyes all night. As soon as the patient made a sound, she would comfort and take care of her with concern. The patient was uneasy, but Wang Xiurong said, "Don't worry, we are all one family. You are here just like you are at home, so get well!"

The next day, the patient's stomach pain worsened. After the doctor examined her, he said she was about to give birth. Wang Xiurong was frantic as nothing was prepared. Aunt Zhang, who was a midwife, immediately came to help. Comrade Yang Jiajun of the garrisoned troops in the same courtyard learned about the situation and immediately took out his own sheets and clothes for the parturient to use. Other comrades also took out their allowances and pooled them together to buy a lot of brown sugar, eggs, and noodles to send over. In the afternoon, the child was born safely, and everything was arranged satisfactorily.

A few days later, Yang Yongqin's illness improved greatly, and her body gradually recovered. She said to Wang Xiurong and the others with emotion, "In the old society, I would have only died on the road this time. Now, Chairman Mao is leading us well, and everyone treats me as one of their own, which saved me from death. I will never forget your kindness." Wei Hexiang (with picture)

    我们都是一家人
    编者按：这篇文章的作者隗和祥是一个革命军人。他过去没念过书；部队开展速成识字学习运动后，他学会了写作。这篇文章是他根据亲身见闻写成的。前宛平县一区天寺村革命军人家属杨永琴，在八月六日到唐山去，路过大兴县三区黄村镇的时候，她突然肚子发痛，拉起痢来。在黄村这个地方，她无亲无友，一个人在路上生了病可怎么好呢？她又难受，又发愁，急得没办法。
    这时三街妇女主任王秀荣在路上看到了她，马上把她扶到区政府。区长问明了情况，就派人去请医生，并且对王秀荣说：“她是一位革命军人家属。你在街上找个房子让她住下，好好照顾她。”王秀荣毫不犹豫地说：“住到我家去。”不久，一位姓刘的医生来了。他仔细地诊断，问明病情，原来杨永琴已经有了九个月的孕，现在又拉起痢来，情况很严重。刘医生开好了药方、拿了药，临走时再三嘱咐王秀荣好好照料病人，并说：“回头我再来看她。”
    王秀荣和邻居张大娘小心地把病人扶到家里，安置在自己的炕上。她们两人给病人烧水煮饭、端屎端尿，忙个不停。这天一整夜，王秀荣没有合过眼睛。只要病人一有响声，她就关心地安慰她、照顾她。病人很不安，王秀荣说：“你别着急，我们都是一家人。你在这儿和在家里一样，好好养病吧！”
    第二天，病人肚子痛得厉害了。医生一检查，说是要生产了。什么也没有准备，王秀荣可急坏了。张大娘会助产，马上赶来帮忙。同院驻军杨家俊同志知道了这个情况，马上拿出自己的被单、衣服给产妇用。其他同志也拿出自己的津贴费，凑起来买了很多红糖、鸡蛋、挂面送来。下午，小孩子平安地出生了，一切都安排得很如意。
    几天以后，杨永琴病好多了，身体也逐渐复原了。她感动地对王秀荣等说：“要是在旧社会，我这次只有死在路上。现在是毛主席领导得好，大家把我当作一家人，才把我从死里救了出来。我永远忘不了你们的恩情。”  隗和祥（附图片）
