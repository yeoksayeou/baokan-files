    Message of Greetings to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Crowther, Member of the World Peace Council, Renowned British Peace Advocate
    All good men and women around the world hope that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will provide guidance and inspiration for their serious struggle for peace. For it is in Asia that the bloody hands and vicious hearts of the aggressors have been fully exposed. It is in Asia that you have been the first to directly suffer the last weapons of a decadent social order—the atomic bomb and bacteriological warfare. It is characteristic of a decadent society that it does not hesitate to abuse humanity's immortal achievements—the atomic secret and the discovery of bacteriology—to temporarily prolong its dying life.
    You in Asia are enduring the influence of the complete moral degradation of these dying men who still possess modern knowledge. Your experience is terrible, but at least its meaning is clear. You have learned what atomic warfare is, what biological warfare is, and what general warfare is today.
    Your behavior in undergoing these experiences is the noblest and most important thing in modern life. For it is you, the people of Asia, who are teaching all mankind how to act under the final test of atomic and bacteriological attack.
    Therefore, the people of Asian countries are today the primary defenders of human morality. It is they who now and in the future will instruct us on how to deal with these unprecedented weapons and horrors, thereby enabling us to gain ample moral strength to solve the enormous problems we face and to place science under the strong control of human conscience.
    We in the West look to you for moral help, for our consciences are burdened with a double burden; it is primarily Westerners who manufactured these new scientific weapons and used them in the East.
    The dignity and sublime patience, and the indomitable determination shown by the people of Korea and China, and the people of Malaya (as a Briton, I am particularly thinking of them) in enduring suffering and fighting stubbornly, have educated all of our people, teaching us how we should act in order to survive in the modern world and to save humanity.
    From your example, we have seen that the human spirit can transcend any horror that can be imagined or manufactured. Our faith in humanity has been strengthened and increased; we are able to look to the future with greater optimism.
    We know that victory in future struggles depends on two principles. On the one hand, we must relentlessly resist aggression and expose the aggressors, while on the other hand, we must vigorously resist all provocations and resolutely adopt a policy of understanding and peace.
    I hope that at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, we will see on the one hand, representatives make a serious moral and wise analysis of the situation, making people more clearly understand the facts of aggression and who the aggressors are; and on the other hand, inspired by a spirit of understanding and fraternity, open up a path towards peace.
    I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the conference and wish you success in your struggle for peace. (Xinhua News Agency)

    给亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的贺信
    世界和平理事会理事  英国著名和平人士  克劳瑟
    全世界的善良男女都盼望亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对于他们争取和平的严重斗争给予指导和鼓舞。因为正是在亚洲，侵略者的血手和恶毒心肠已经暴露无遗。你们在亚洲，首先直接经受了腐朽的社会秩序的最后武器——原子弹和细菌战。这个腐朽的社会竟不惜滥用人类的不朽成就——原子秘密和细菌学的发现来暂时延续它的濒于灭亡的生命，这正是腐朽社会的特点。
    你们在亚洲正经受着这些垂死的但仍掌握有现代知识的人们道德完全沦丧的影响。你们的经历是可怕的，但是至少它的意义是明白的。你们了解到什么叫原子战，什么叫生物战，什么是今天的一般战争。
    你们在经受这些经历时所表现的行为，是现代生活中最崇高、最重要的东西。因为正是你们亚洲人民教导全人类在受到原子和细菌攻击的最后考验下，应该如何行动。
    因此，亚洲各国人民今天是人类道德的主要保卫者。正是他们现在和将来指示我们如何对付这种前所未有的武器和恐怖，从而使我们获得充沛的道义力量来解决我们面临的巨大问题，并使科学受到人类良知的坚强控制。
    我们在西方，盼望你们在道义上帮助我们，因为我们的良心上压着双重负担；这是由于制造这些新式科学武器并把这些武器用于东方的，主要都是西方人。
    朝鲜和中国人民以及马来亚人民（作为一个英国人，我特别想到他们）在忍受苦难和顽强不屈作战时所表现的尊严和崇高的耐性以及百折不回的决心，教育了我们全体人民，使我们知道为了在现代世界中求生存，为了挽救人类，我们应该如何行动。
    我们从你们的榜样里看到了：人类的精神能够凌驾在可以想像或制造出来的任何恐怖之上。我们对于人类的信心已经加强和增加了；我们能够更加乐观地瞻望未来。
    我们知道，为使将来的斗争得到胜利，要依靠两个原则。我们一方面必须无情地抵抗侵略并揭露侵略者，同时我们必须极力抵制一切挑拨行动，坚决采取谅解及和平的政策。
    我希望在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，我们一方面能够看到代表们对于局势作一番严肃的道义和明智的分析，使人们更清楚地了解侵略的事实以及谁是侵略者；另一方面能够在谅解和博爱精神的鼓舞下，开辟出一条通向和平的道路。
    谨向大会致衷心的祝贺，并预祝你们在争取和平的斗争中获得胜利。（新华社）
