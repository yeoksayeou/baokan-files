    Beijing Transportation Workers and Others Continue to Write Letters Exposing That Poisoning Accidents Still Occur Due to Neglect of Worker Safety

    After the "Readers' Letters Page" of this newspaper published a letter from the China Dockworkers' Union Correspondence Group on August 27, entitled "The Vast Number of Dockworkers Nationwide Urgently Demand the Eradication of Poisoning Accidents from Handling Dangerous Goods," many dockworkers, trade union workers, and transportation company staff in Beijing wrote to this newspaper, unanimously supporting the views of the China Dockworkers' Union Correspondence Group and continuing to expose the serious errors of some consigning unit leaders and staff who disregard the life safety of workers.

    Reader Liang Yaoxing wrote: "The Sixth Construction Section of a certain unit in Beijing deceived workers into transporting asphalt on July 17, poisoning six workers. Sui Xinquan, the material clerk of the section, knew about the workers' poisoning but thought it was not a big deal. On the 18th, he deceived another group of workers into transporting asphalt. At that time, these dockworkers saw that the workers in the section were wearing gas masks when working, so they asked Sui Xinquan to borrow a few (because the section had spare gas masks), but Sui Xinquan refused to lend them. As a result, another six dockworkers were poisoned." Li Guangda and Chen Yongzhong of the Beijing Transportation Company Trade Union wrote: "The Yongxin Asphalt Felt Factory outside Xibianmen in Beijing often deceives workers into transporting asphalt, and worker poisoning accidents occur frequently. Because the factory is unwilling to prepare gas masks, it often hires unorganized cart drivers to transport the asphalt. Once, when workers discovered symptoms of poisoning, they refused to transport it anymore. The factory threatened the workers, saying that if the goods were not delivered, they would not be paid. When the trade union found out, it protested to the factory. The factory then paid the wages and medical expenses to the workers. However, in July and mid-August of this year, the factory deceived workers into transporting asphalt twice again, resulting in poisoning accidents."

    Qiao Zhishan, a loading and unloading worker at Yongdingmen, exposed the erroneous behavior of certain cadres in the Yongdingmen Warehouse of the Beijing Grain Company who disregarded the life safety of workers. The letter said: "On August 4, the warehouse had workers transport grain that had just been treated with 666 powder, which resulted in a poisoning accident. However, the warehouse staff did not pay attention to this problem and continued to have workers transport it. As a result, from the 6th to the 8th, three more poisoning accidents occurred, with a total of twenty-nine poisoned workers. Later, it was only after consultation between the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Trade Union, and other units and the warehouse that a decision was made to stop the transportation. However, some cadres in the warehouse still thought: the workers are too scared, if everyone is like this, there is no need to work."

    Comrade Wang Chunshan of the Beijing Transportation Company exposed the tragic consequences caused by certain units' failure to pay attention to the packaging of dangerous goods. The letter said: "On August 6 and 7, when dockworkers at the Yongdingmen Grain Warehouse in Beijing unloaded wheat from the train, fifteen workers were poisoned one after another, some with dizziness and vomiting, and some with swollen skin and itchy all over. Why did poisoning accidents occur when transporting grain? According to the workers' inspection, these train cars had been loaded with toxic goods before loading the grain, and because the packaging of these toxic goods was not good, the powder was scattered on the train cars, which also contaminated the grain bags. What is even more intolerable is that some units violated the regulations of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government by having workers transport unpackaged asphalt. For example, the Xizhimen Oil Distribution Plant of the Beijing Construction Bureau has always hired unorganized cart drivers to transport unpackaged asphalt blocks, and also requires the cart drivers to be responsible for loading and unloading, which greatly damages the health of the workers. The plant's internal anti-poison equipment is also very poor. When I went to the plant to understand the situation, a blending worker secretly asked me to report this situation to you."

    Wang Changhai and Liu Zhenlin, loading and unloading workers of the Second Team in the Qianmen District of the Beijing Transportation Company, wrote: "Our dockworkers have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and are striving to build our beloved motherland. However, the responsible cadres and staff of certain consigning units do not care about our lives. We must strictly criticize these people." In order to eradicate this phenomenon, in accordance with the suggestions put forward by the China Dockworkers' Union Correspondence Group, the People's Government should be requested to give due punishment to those bureaucratic elements who disregard worker safety. Some workers also wrote to suggest that the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government should notify its affiliated freight units to strictly inspect the packaging when carrying dangerous goods. If the packaging is incomplete or not strong enough, it should not be transported; train cars that have carried toxic goods should be thoroughly disinfected.

### 北京市运输工人等继续来信揭露  漠视工人安全中毒事故仍不断发生

专栏：读者来信综述

    北京市运输工人等继续来信揭露
    漠视工人安全中毒事故仍不断发生
    本报“读者来信专页”在八月二十七日发表了中国搬运工会通讯组关于“全国广大搬运工人迫切要求根绝搬运危险性物品中毒事故”的来信后，北京市很多搬运工人、工会工作者和搬运公司工作人员给本报来信，一致支持中国搬运工会通讯组的意见，并继续揭发了某些托运单位负责人和工作人员漠视工人生命安全的严重错误。
    读者梁耀兴来信说：“北京某单位第六施工所在七月十七日欺骗工人搬运沥青，使六个工人中了毒。该所材料员隋鑫泉知道了工人中毒情况后，竟认为没有什么关系。十八日，他又欺骗另外几个工人搬运沥青。当时，这些搬运工人看到该所的工人工作时都带着防毒用具，就向隋鑫泉要求借用几个
    （因该所有多余的防毒面具），但隋鑫泉却不肯借。结果，又有六个搬运工人中了毒。”北京市运输公司工会李广达、陈用中来信说：“北京西便门外永新油毡厂经常欺骗工人搬运沥青，工人中毒事故不断发生。该厂因为不愿准备防毒用具，就经常找无组织的大车工人来搬运。有一次，工人发现中毒现象后，不愿再运了。该厂竟威胁工人，说是货没拉完，不给算账。工会知道了，就向该厂提出抗议。该厂才拿出工资，并付给工人医疗费用。但今年七月和八月中，该厂又先后两次欺骗工人搬运沥青，造成中毒事故。”
    永定门装卸工人乔致善揭露了北京市粮食公司永定门仓库某些干部漠视工人生命安全的错误行为。来信说：“八月四日该库让工人搬运刚打过六六六粉的粮食，就发生了中毒事故。但该库工作人员毫不重视这个问题，继续让工人搬运。结果，六日到八日又连续发生中毒事故三次，中毒工人共二十九人。后来还是市劳动局、市政工会等单位和库方协商，才决定停止搬运。但该库某些干部还认为：工人们怕得太厉害了，要是大家都这样，就不用做工作了。”
    北京市运输公司王春山同志揭发了某些单位因不注意危险性物品的包装所引起的惨痛后果。来信说：“八月六日、七日，北京市永定门粮食仓库的搬运工人从火车上卸小麦时，连续有十五个工人中毒，有的头晕、呕吐，有的皮肉发肿、周身刺痒。为什么搬运粮食也会发生中毒事故呢？根据工人检查，原来这些车皮在装运粮食之前是装有毒性的货物的，而这些有毒性的货物因包装不好，粉末散在车皮上，就使粮食包上也沾上了。更不可容忍的是，有些单位违反中央人民政府劳动部的规定，让工人搬运没有包装的沥青。像北京市建设局西直门配油厂一贯雇无组织的大车工人运没包装的沥青块，还要让大车工人负责装卸，使工人健康受到很大摧残。该厂厂内防毒设备也很差。我到该厂了解情况时，一个配油工人偷偷地要求我把这个情况向你们反应。”
    北京市运输公司前门区第二中队装卸工人王长海、刘振林来信说：“我们搬运工人都积极地响应了毛主席增产节约的号召，为建设我们可爱的祖国而努力。但是，某些托运单位的负责干部和工作人员，竟不管我们的死活。我们要对这些人提出严格的批评。”为了根绝这种现象，应该按照中国搬运工会通讯组提出的建议，要求人民政府对那些不顾工人安全的官僚主义分子，给予应得的处分。有的工人并来信建议中央人民政府铁道部通知所属货运单位，在承运危险性物品时严格地检查包装，如果包装不完整、不坚固，应不予运输；车皮运载有毒性的货物后，则应彻底消毒。
