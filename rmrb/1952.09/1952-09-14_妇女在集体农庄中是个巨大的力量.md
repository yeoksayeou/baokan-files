Women Are a Great Force in Collective Farms
Zi Gang

Stalin once said: "Women are a great force in collective farms. To bury this force is a crime. Our responsibility is to promote women in collective farms and utilize this force." (Stalin: "Speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers.")

For more than twenty years, the development process of Soviet collective farms has fully confirmed Stalin's brilliant instructions. Soviet women have become the main force in the construction of collective farms. Although Angelina and her women's tractor team were initially hindered and ridiculed by men and women when they drove tractors to the fields for the first time in 1933, soon after, some of the women who ridiculed them also became tractor drivers themselves. In the labor of collective farms, Soviet rural women finally got rid of their status of being despised and enslaved, and many of them became glorious socialist labor heroes.

The Chinese farmers' delegation deeply felt the great role of women in collective farms in the Soviet Union. Every collective farm's report pointed out that women undertook more than 70% of all the work in the farm. In the years of the Great Patriotic War in 1943, women collective farmers accounted for 72% of the labor in the farm. After their fathers, husbands, and brothers rushed to the front, they entered their original positions. At that time, there were more than 200,000 female tractor drivers alone, and if female combine drivers and female mechanics were added, there were almost one million. They guaranteed the supply of grain and industrial raw materials during the war.

Xie Ruizhen, a 20-year-old female township head from Sichuan and a member of the delegation, said that she saw the production team leader, Simirzeyeva, in the "Red October" collective farm in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. She is 23 years old this year. At the age of twelve, she left school to participate in production for the needs of the war. Because of her active and responsible work, she was elected as the team leader and won the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. The cotton field she managed can produce 14,000 kilograms per hectare. Last year, she got 580 workdays. Her labor is admirable, and her life is enviable. Her family has plenty of food and clothing, and the house is beautiful. Every night she goes to study and improve her agricultural technology. She feels honored to be able to overfulfill the production tasks assigned to her by the state.

Mo Rigece, a model agricultural worker in Inner Mongolia, saw a female farm member, Dava Lieke, in the "Red Star" collective farm in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. She is a 25-year-old socialist labor hero, a representative of the Supreme Soviet, and a member of the government of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1951, she harvested 187 quintals of sugar beets per hectare. Two-thirds of the farm members in that farm are women. Their production is often higher than that of male farm members. There are seven socialist labor heroes in the whole farm, five of whom are women. In the areas visited by the delegation, female labor heroes often accounted for more than half. Whether they are farm chairpersons, Party or Youth League leaders, tractor and combine drivers, agricultural technicians, farm members, or livestock personnel, they all have outstanding achievements.

The Chinese people have seen Soviet films such as "A Happy Life," "Tractor Drivers," "Government Member," and other works with the theme of Soviet collective farms, and have recognized the glorious labor and happy life of Soviet women. The days of slavery that Russian women lived in the Tsarist era are long gone. Female township head Xie Ruizhen said: "In the remote mountain valleys of our hometown, women used to have to ask men to buy them hairnets or hairpins; looking at the Soviet female collective farmers, they can't even spend all the cash, grain, and other materials they get in a year, and they even buy Victory brand cars themselves!"

Dong Lisheng, a member of the delegation who was a stretcher hero in the Liberation War and is now a female tractor driver, said: "The female chairpersons of collective farms in the Soviet Union are often university graduates who have studied science at the university and still engage in production when they return; there are so many books in the collective farms, and the farm members have organized Marxist-Leninist study groups, which is a true combination of theory and practice. There is an old lady in the Academy of Sciences who is almost seventy years old and has a doctorate. She only started learning at the age of forty-five."

Tian Yun, the deputy county head of Shulu County, Hebei, and one of the female representatives, said: There are many female leading cadres in general in the Soviet Union, and even more in collective farms. An important reason why female collective farmers can work freely and exert their strength is that collective farms take meticulous care of women. Every farm has excellent obstetrical wards, and female farm members rest for two months during childbirth, and female tractor drivers rest for three months because of the heavier work. During the rest period, the collective farm pays them half of their usual labor remuneration. In the Budyonny collective farm, the kindergartens and nurseries are better than those at our special district level, and mothers have to bathe and change clothes before breastfeeding. There is a "Department of Mothers with Many Children" in the district's administrative organization, which specializes in taking care of mothers with many children. Mothers who have given birth to nine children can, according to regulations, no longer participate in production, and the state gives them subsidies. The "October Victory" collective farm stipulates that women with children can go to the fields one hour later and return one hour earlier, but none of the mothers who are determined to actively complete the state's tasks are willing to do so.

In one collective farm that Tian Yun visited, thirteen of the seventeen labor heroes were women. In Kazakhstan, all the third deputy secretaries of the Party committees are women, and they are specifically responsible for women's work. In the Budyonny collective farm, dozens of representatives of the delegation were scattered and lived in the homes of various collective farm members due to darkness and rain, and they found that every family lived so comfortably. Twenty-seven families have cars, and the families with the best labor also enjoy the best. Female farmers usually wear leather shoes and cloth clothes to work in the fields, and on Sundays, they put on woolen and silk clothes, take cars to visit relatives, watch plays, or go to the city to play. Everyone has seven or eight sets of beautiful clothes in their wardrobes!

This is just as Comrade Stalin said at the meeting with the shock workers of the beet-growing area in 1935: "Only this collective farm life can eliminate inequality and help women to stand up... The collective farm implements the system of workdays. But what is a workday? Everyone who stands before the workday—whether you are a man or a woman—is equal. Whoever works more workdays earns more money. There, neither the father nor the husband, no one can blame the woman, because he does not support her. Now the woman, if she is working and has accumulated workdays, she is also the master."

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the government, and Comrade Stalin, thousands of female collective farmers in the Soviet Union are gloriously completing their tasks. This has given the Chinese farmers' delegation a deep understanding, and especially inspired our female labor models. They want to return to the countryside to publicize this fact and encourage Chinese rural women to pursue this fact! (Attached picture)

    妇女在集体农庄中是个巨大的力量
    子　冈
    斯大林曾经说：“妇女在集体农庄中是个巨大的力量。埋没这个力量，就是犯罪了。我们的责任，就是要在集体农庄中提拔妇女，运用这个力量。”（斯大林：“在全苏联集体农庄突击队员第一次代表大会上的演说”。）
    二十多年来，苏联集体农庄的发展过程完全证实了斯大林的英明指示。苏联妇女已经成为集体农庄建设中的主要力量。虽然安格林娜和她的女子拖拉机队在一九三三年头一次驾驶着拖拉机到田间耕作时，曾经受到男子和女人的阻挠和讥笑，但不久以后，有些讥笑她们的妇女，自己也变成拖拉机手了。在集体农庄的劳动中，苏联农村妇女最后摆脱了被轻视被奴役的地位，他们中间许多人都成为光荣的社会主义劳动英雄。
    中国农民代表参观团在苏联深深体会了妇女在集体农庄中的巨大作用。每个集体农庄的报告都指出：妇女担任了农庄里全部工作的百分之七十以上。在一九四三年卫国战争的年代，女集体农民在农庄中的劳动占了百分之七十二。她们的父亲、丈夫、兄弟涌上前线以后，她们就进入了他们原来的岗位。当时只女拖拉机手就有二十多万人，如果加上康拜因女驾驶员和女机械师，几乎有百万人以上。她们保证了战时的粮食和工业原料的供应。
    参观团的代表之一、二十岁的四川女乡长谢瑞贞说，她在苏联阿塞拜疆共和国的“红十月”集体农庄看见了生产小组长席米尔则也娃。她今年二十三岁。她在十二岁时为了战争的需要，就离开学校，参加了生产。因为她积极负责，被选为小组长，得过列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章。她经管的棉花地每公顷可以生产一万四千公斤。去年她得到五百八十个劳动日。她的劳动叫人敬佩，她的生活叫人羡慕。她家中衣食丰足，房子漂亮。每天晚上她都去读书，进修农业技术。她为能够超额完成国家分配给她的生产任务而感到光荣。
    内蒙农业劳动模范莫日格策在卡查赫共和国的“红星”集体农庄看到女庄员达娃列柯。这是一位二十五岁的社会主义劳动英雄，最高苏维埃代表，又是卡查赫共和国政府委员。她在一九五一年一公顷甜菜收了一百八十七公担。在那个农庄中有三分之二的女庄员。她们的生产量往往比男庄员还高。全农庄有七个社会主义劳动英雄，其中就有五个是女的。在参观团所到的地区，女劳动英雄往往要占一半以上。她们无论是作农庄主席、党、团负责人、拖拉机和康拜因驾驶员、农业技师、庄员或畜牧人员，都有卓越的成绩。
    中国人民看过苏联影片“幸福的生活”、“拖拉机手”、“政府委员”及其他以苏联集体农庄为题材的作品，认识了苏联妇女的光荣劳动和幸福生活。沙皇时代俄国妇女过的奴隶日子早已一去不复返了。谢瑞贞女乡长说：“在我们家乡的山沟沟里，以前女人要个头网或钗钗，都得请男人给买；看看苏联的女集体农民，一年分得的现金、粮食和其他实物用不完，连胜利牌小汽车也是自己买的！”
    在解放战争中曾经是担架英雄、现在是女拖拉机手的参观团团员董力生说：“苏联的集体农庄女主席往往是大学毕业生，在大学研究过科学，回来仍旧生产；集体农庄中有那么多的书，庄员间组织了马克思列宁主义研究小组，这真是理论结合实际。科学院里有一位老妈妈，快七十岁了，是个博士，她是在四十五岁时才开始学习的。”
    女代表之一、河北束鹿县副县长田蕴说：在苏联一般的妇女领导干部就不少，集体农庄中更多。女集体农民能够放手工作、发挥力量的一个重要原因是集体农庄对女子照顾得无微不至。每个农庄都有很好的产科病房，女庄员生产中休息两个月，女拖拉机手因为工作较重，休息三个月。在休息期间，集体农庄发给她们平素劳动报酬的一半。在布琼尼集体农庄，幼儿园、托儿所比我们专区一级的还好，妈妈们在喂奶前要沐浴更衣。在区的行政组织中有“多子母亲科”，专门照料多子母亲。生了九个孩子的母亲们，照章可以不再参加生产，国家给她们津贴。“十月胜利”集体农庄规定有孩子的妇女可以晚去田间一小时，早回一小时，但是一心要积极完成国家任务的母亲们没有谁肯这样作。
    在田蕴去过的一个集体农庄里，十七个劳动英雄中有十三个是女的。在卡查赫，凡是党委第三副书记全是女的，她们专门负责妇女工作。在布琼尼集体农庄，参观团几十位代表曾因天黑下雨分散住在各集体农户家中，他们发现每家生活都是那么舒适。有二十七家有小汽车，劳动最好的人家也是享受最好的人家。女农民们平日穿了皮鞋和布衣服到田间工作，星期日就换上毛质、丝质的衣服，坐了汽车串门、看戏，或是进城游玩。每人都有七、八套漂亮衣服放在衣橱里！
    这正如斯大林同志一九三五年在招待甜菜区集体农庄突击队员的会上所说的：“只有这集体农庄的生活，才可以铲除不平等，才可以扶助妇女使之站立起来……集体农庄实行了劳动日的制度。然而什么是劳动日呢？站在劳动日底面前的——无论你是男子还是妇女——都是一律平等的。谁工作的劳动日较多，谁就赚得较多的钱。在那里无论是父亲，也无论是丈夫，任何人也不得对于妇女有所非难，这是因为他并没有养活着她。现在的妇女，假使她劳动着并且积有劳动日，她自己也就是主人翁了。”
    苏联千千万万女集体农民们在联共党、政府和斯大林同志的领导下，光荣地完成着她们的任务。这使得中国农民代表参观团有了深刻的认识，尤其使我们的妇女劳动模范们得到鼓舞。她们要回到农村中去宣传这个事实，鼓动中国农村妇女追求这个事实！（附图片）
