    Zheng Luoquan and Others Thank the People's Government for Fair Handling
    Editor's Note: After Zheng Luoquan and five others from Mendong Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province, were falsely accused and wrongly judged, the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government immediately sent cadres Ding Manjun and others to form an investigation team with cadres from the Hebei Provincial People's Government and relevant prefectures, counties, and districts to investigate the matter locally. After the case was retried, the falsely accused Zheng Luoquan and others jointly wrote a letter to Comrade Ding Manjun to express their gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for their fair handling of the case. The following is the letter of gratitude.

    Comrade Ding Manjun: On August 11th, at the mass meeting in Mendong Village in which you participated, the case in which we were falsely accused by Zheng Yi was retried. Please convey our thanks to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government on our behalf.

    You are truly good comrades serving the people. Representing Chairman Mao, you came to our village despite the summer heat, lived with the villagers, and painstakingly investigated the circumstances of our false accusation, revealing the truth of the case. The Supreme People's Court ordered the Hebei Provincial People's Court to revoke the erroneous judgment of December 1951, and retry the case, restoring the freedom of those of us who were falsely accused and sentencing Zheng Yi, who made the false accusation out of spite, to three years in prison. Such fair handling makes us endlessly grateful! You repeatedly talked to us, telling us to "unite and produce" in the future, and we have kept that firmly in mind. From now on, we are determined to repay you and Chairman Mao with practical actions in production.

    Once again, please convey our gratitude to our savior, Chairman Mao.
    The falsely accused by Zheng Yi in Mendong Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province,
    Zheng Luoquan　Xu Guanqing
    Zheng Luoshuai　Liu Zhebin
    Zheng Jicang　Zheng Kuchuang

    郑洛权等感谢人民政府的公正处理
    编者按：河北省安国县门东村郑洛权等六人 被诬告错判后，中央人民政府最高人民检察署即派干部丁曼君等会同河北省人民政府及有关专区、县、区干部组成调查组前往当地调查。该案改判后，被诬告人郑洛权等联名写信给丁曼君同志表示感谢毛主席、中央人民政府的公正处理。下面便是这封感谢信。
    丁曼君同志：八月十一日在你们参加的门东村的群众大会上，我们被郑义诬告的案件改判了。请您代我们感谢毛主席、中央人民政府。
    你们真是为人民服务的好同志。你们代表毛主席，不避炎夏来到我们村中，和老乡们一起生活，费尽心机把我们被诬告的情况作了调查，使案情大白。并由最高人民法院责令河北省人民法院撤消了一九五一年十二月的错误判决，重新审判，使我们被诬告的恢复了自由，对挟嫌诬告的郑义判处三年徒刑。这样公正的处理，真使我们感谢不尽！你们一再和我们谈，今后要“团结生产”，我们已经牢记在心；今后我们决心用生产上的实际行动，来报答你们，报答毛主席。
    再重复一声，请您代我们感谢我们的救星毛主席。河北省安国县门东村被郑义诬告人
