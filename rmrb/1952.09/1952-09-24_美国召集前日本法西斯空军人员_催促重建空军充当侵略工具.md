Xinhua News Agency, September 21st, Tokyo Dispatch: U.S. Air Force authorities are urging former Japanese fascist Air Force personnel to rebuild the Japanese Air Force in order to serve as a tool of U.S. aggression.

According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun," Benfield, Deputy Chief of Intelligence of the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, accompanied by U.S. Air Force officials, hosted a group of former Japanese Air Force leaders in Tokyo on the 18th. They included Lieutenant General Michihiro Sugawara, former Director-General of Aviation of the Japanese Army Ministry, who commanded the Japanese Air Force in the indiscriminate bombing of Wuhan, China, and Southeast Asia during the war, as well as a naval admiral who had served as a Japanese naval attaché in the United States, thirteen former Air Force officers from the Japanese Army Ministry, and four former Air Force officers from the Japanese Navy Ministry.

At the reception, Benfield strongly urged these former Japanese Air Force personnel to "cooperate fully" in establishing a Japanese Air Force. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated: "The Americans believe that Japan should establish an Air Force in addition to the Police Reserve and the Maritime Safety Agency." Benfield also indicated to these Japanese Air Force personnel that the United States would soon supply Japan with jet aircraft when necessary.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st, Tokyo Dispatch: TASS Tokyo, September 21st: "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that, according to well-informed sources, U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Murphy, expressed his hope to Yoshida during their meeting on September 13th that Japan would immediately begin expanding its "defense" forces, increasing this army to 320,000 men within two years.

According to the newspaper, Japanese business leaders hope that the United States will make large-scale investments in Japan's war industry. An official from the U.S. Embassy recently pointed out the possibility of such investments during a meeting with representatives of the business community.
