Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries

    Soviet Schools at All Levels Begin Classes

    Soviet schools at all levels opened on September 1st. Thousands of students, after spending a happy and meaningful summer, have returned to school from hiking trips, survey teams, internships, and sanatoriums. New students at all levels have also begun a new stage of learning. Before the start of the new school year, schools everywhere have been renovated and refurbished, and many books, instruments, and equipment have been added. More than 40 central publishing bureaus and many large printing plants have also published a large number of textbooks and reference books for the new school year. In the Russian Federation's primary and secondary schools alone, 126 million textbooks and more than 3,000 kinds of teaching aids and instruments were provided this year.

    One of the characteristics of the new school year in the Soviet Union is the expansion of the school distribution network and the increase in the number of students. Taking higher education as an example, the Soviet Union had 887 institutions of higher learning last year, and this year it has increased to more than 900. This year, these schools broke past records and enrolled more than 370,000 new students. The total number of students in institutions of higher learning has now reached 1,416,000, an increase of 60,000 over last year. Moscow alone has 270,000 students in its 103 higher education institutions, which is more than the total number of university students in Britain and France combined.

    The Soviet Union's network of technical schools and correspondence schools has also expanded. At present, there are 3,500 technical schools and secondary specialized schools in the Soviet Union, training 475,000 technical personnel for the cause of communist construction. There are 20 correspondence research institutes and more than 450 correspondence departments of higher education institutions in the Soviet Union. In the new school year, a total of 500,000 people are studying in correspondence schools, an increase of 100,000 over last year. The Soviet Union's workers and other working people have widely gained the opportunity to continue their studies and further their education without leaving their jobs.

    Bulgaria Reduces Prices Again

    On August 31, the Bulgarian Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a decision on further reducing the state unified retail prices of food and industrial products. From September 1, the retail price of rye bread will be reduced by 25 percent, wheat bread by 30 percent, macaroni products by 22 percent, wheat flour by 30 percent, rye flour by 25 percent, vegetable oil by 6 to 10 percent, dairy products by 10 to 12 percent, and meat products by 5 to 8 percent. The prices of industrial products have also been reduced simultaneously, with cotton and woolen fabrics reduced by 4 to 12 percent, knitted goods by 8 to 15 percent, clothing and footwear by 4 to 10 percent, radios by 10 percent, laundry soap by 11 percent, and building materials by 5 to 16 percent. The prices of books and medicines have also been reduced separately.

    This is the second price reduction this year. Due to the victorious development of the national economy and the rapid increase in industrial and agricultural production, Bulgaria abolished the rationing system for industrial products in 1951. When it implemented currency reform in May of this year, it also abolished food rationing and reduced food prices. At that time, the state unified retail prices were set by reducing non-rationed prices by 6 to 50 percent. Among them, the price of bread was reduced by 35 percent, rice by 50 percent, and vegetable oil by 38 percent. With the abolition of food rationing, the monthly salaries of workers and staff also increased by 1,300 to 2,400 leva. Only three months after the complete abolition of rationing and the reduction of food prices, Bulgaria was able to comprehensively reduce prices again, which undoubtedly proves the superiority of the people's democratic system and will further significantly improve the living standards of the Bulgarian working people.

    The Bulgarian working people greeted the decisions to reduce the prices of food and industrial products twice with joy and excitement. Meetings were held in factories, construction sites, and agricultural cooperatives across the country, and the working people expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the Communist Party's constant concern for the people's welfare. Markov, a miner from Dimitrovgrad, said at the meeting: "Our labor is becoming easier day by day, labor is becoming more and more pleasant, and our lives are becoming more and more happy and prosperous. The Party and the government's new concern for the working people inspires my creative enthusiasm, and I want to overfulfill the plan and produce hundreds of tons more coal for the national economy." The workers of the "Volcano" factory in Stalin City greeted the decision to reduce prices with excitement. In order to repay the Communist Party and the People's Government for their concern for improving the welfare of the working people, the employees of the factory decided to complete the first Dimitrov Five-Year Plan before September 9, 1952.

    Korean Farmers Intensify Grass Cutting and Fertilizer Accumulation

    Farmers in northern Korea are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government and are intensifying their work of cutting grass and accumulating fertilizer during the gap before the grain is harvested, preparing to meet the battle task of increasing grain production next year.

    In order to ensure grain production next year, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party issued a letter to party organizations at all levels and all party members on July 22. The Central Committee of the Workers' Party pointed out that in order to expand the Korean War, the US armed aggressors are trying every means to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations and are carrying out barbaric bombings of the Korean rear. Under the circumstances of protracted warfare, one of the decisive conditions for winning victory is the issue of ensuring grain supply. To increase grain production, more fertilizer must be applied. Preparing a large amount of fertilizer is a decisive condition for ensuring agricultural production next year. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party called on party organizations at all levels, all party members, and the people to launch a party-wide and nationwide movement to carry out the work of preparing fertilizer. At the same time, the Republic's Cabinet also made a "Decision on Fertilizer Measures for 1953," stipulating specific measures to ensure the completion of the fertilizer accumulation work.

    After the call of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's Cabinet was issued, mobilization meetings were held in various places. Competition was launched enthusiastically between villages and villages, work teams and work teams, and individuals and individuals. With the efforts of all farmers, farmers in many parts of the vast mountainous areas have completed the work of cutting grass and preparing fertilizer. Farmers in Deokcheon, Ningyuan, Daedong, Junghwa, and Anju in South Pyongan Province had completed all or most of their grass-cutting plans for this year by mid-August. Rural areas in the suburbs of Kaesong City and Kaepung County, which are close to the front line, have also largely completed their grass-cutting plans.

    In the competition movement, members of the Korean Workers' Party and members of the Democratic Youth League stood at the forefront, promoting the competition to a climax. For example, the labor party members in Sin-gyeong-ri, Jeongpyeong-gun, South Hamgyong Province, cut 500 to 600 kilograms of grass every day in the competition. Several members of the Democratic Youth Work Team were also able to cut an average of more than 500 kilograms of grass per day. Their labor enthusiasm and achievements encouraged the farmers in the whole village and promoted the daily increase in the amount of grass cutting in the whole village.

    Factories, enterprises, organs, and schools, on the one hand, prepared the natural fertilizer needed for their own sideline farms, and on the other hand, organized labor assistance teams to go to the countryside to help farmers accumulate fertilizer. The soldiers of the Korean-Chinese People's Army, who have always assisted farmers in agricultural production, enthusiastically helped the families of martyrs, the families of Korean People's Army soldiers, and farmers who lacked labor to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer. This kind of assistance further encouraged the farmers' production enthusiasm and their confidence in supporting the front line to win greater victories.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    苏联各级学校开学
    苏联各级学校已在九月一日开学。成千上万的学生在度过了愉快而有意义的暑假生活之后，已从远足队、调查队、实习地点和休养地区回校上课了。各级学校的新生也开始走上了新的学习阶段。在新的学年开始之前，各地的学校都已修缮整理一新，并且增添了许多图书、仪器和设备。四十多所中央出版局和许多大印刷厂也已为新的学年出版了大量的教科书和参考用书。单是俄罗斯联邦的中小学校，今年就得到了一亿二千六百万册教科书和三千多种教学用具及仪器。
    苏联新学年的特色之一就是学校分布网的扩大和学生人数的增加。以高等教育为例，苏联去年有八百八十七所高等学校，今年已增加到九百多所。今年这些学校打破了过去的纪录，招收了三十七万多名新生，现在高等学校的学生总人数已达一百四十一万六千名，比去年增加了六万名。单是莫斯科一百零三个高等教育机关就有二十七万学生，比英法两国的大学生人数的总和还要多。
    苏联的技术学校和函授学校分布网也扩大了。现在，苏联的技术学校和中等专门学校已达三千五百所，为共产主义建设事业培养着四十七万五千名技术人才。苏联全国共有二十个函授研究所、四百五十多个高等学校的函授部。在新的学年中共有五十万人在函授学校学习，比去年增多了十万人。苏联的在职工人和其他劳动人民已广泛地获得了不离开工作岗位继续学习深造的机会。
    保加利亚再次减低物价
    保加利亚部长会议和保加利亚共产党中央委员会八月三十一日发布了关于再次减低粮食和工业品的国家统一零售价格的决定。从九月一日起，稞麦面包的零售价格减低百分之二十五，小麦面包百分之三十，通心粉制品百分之二十二，小麦粉百分之三十，稞麦粉百分之二十五，植物油百分之六到十，乳制品百分之十到十二，肉制品百分之五到八。工业品的价格也同时减低了。其中棉织品和毛织品的价格减低百分之四到十二，编织品百分之八到十五，成衣和鞋类百分之四到十，收音机百分之十，日用肥皂百分之十一，建筑材料百分之五到十六。书籍和药品的价格也分别减低了。
    这是今年第二次减低物价了。由于国民经济的胜利发展，工业和农业生产的迅速增加，保加利亚在一九五一年就废除了工业品配给制，在今年五月实行币制改革时，又废除了食物配给制，减低了食物的价格。当时国家统一零售价格是按照将非配给价格减低百分之六到百分之五十而制定的。其中，面包价格减低百分之三十五，大米减低百分之五十，植物油减低百分之三十八。随着食物配给制的废止，工人和职员的月薪也增加了一千三百至二千四百利瓦。在全面废除配给和减低食物价格以后才三个多月，保加利亚又能全面减低物价，无疑证明了人民民主制度的优越性，并将使保加利亚劳动人民的生活水平进一步显著提高。
    保加利亚劳动人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接了两次减低食物和工业品价格的决定。全国各工厂、建筑场地、农业合作社都纷纷举行集会，劳动人民在会上衷心表示感谢共产党对人民福利不断的关怀。季米特洛夫城的矿工马尔科夫在会上说：“我们的劳动一天天减轻，劳动愈来愈使人感到愉快，我们的生活愈来愈幸福富足。党和政府对劳动人民新的关怀鼓舞着我的创造热忱，我要超计划替国民经济多生产数百吨煤。”斯大林城“火山”工厂的工人以兴奋的心情迎接了减低物价的决定。该厂员工为了报答共产党和人民政府对提高劳动人民的福利的关怀，决定在一九五二年九月九日以前完成第一个季米特洛夫五年计划。
    朝鲜农民加紧割草积肥
    朝鲜北部各地农民热烈响应朝鲜劳动党与共和国政府的号召，正在趁谷物上场之前的空隙，加紧进行割草积肥的工作，准备迎接明年度增产粮食的战斗任务。
    为了保证明年度的粮食生产，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会于七月二十二日发表告各级党组织和全体党员书。劳动党中央指出：美国武装侵略者为了扩大朝鲜战争，正在千方百计地拖延破坏停战谈判，并对朝鲜后方肆行野蛮轰炸。在持久作战的情况下，争取胜利的决定性条件之一是保证粮食供给的问题。增产粮食，必须多施肥料。准备大量积肥就是保证明年农业生产的一个决定性条件。因此，劳动党中央号召各级党组织、全体党员和人民展开一个全党、全民性的运动，来展开准备积肥的工作。同时，共和国内阁也作出了“关于一九五三年度肥料措施的决定”，订出保证完成积肥工作的具体办法。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国内阁的号召发出后，各地方都召开了动员大会。里和里、作业班和作业班、个人和个人之间，都热烈地展开了竞赛。在全体农民的努力下，广大山岳地带已有很多地方的农民完成了割草和准备积肥的工作。平安南道德川、宁远、大同、中和、安州等地的农民在八月中旬即已全部或大部完成了今年的割草计划。临近前线的开城市郊和开丰郡等地农村，也已大部完成割草计划。
    在竞赛运动中，朝鲜劳动党党员和民主青年同盟盟员们都站在最前列，推动竞赛走向高潮。如咸镜南道定平郡新京里的劳动党员们，在竞赛中每天割草五、六百斤不等。民主青年作业班中有几个盟员每天也能平均割草五百斤以上。他们的劳动热情和成绩，鼓舞了全里的农民，促使全里的割草数量天天增加。
    各工厂、企业、机关、学校一方面准备本单位副业农场所需要的自然肥料，同时，组织了劳动协助队下乡，帮助农民积肥。一贯协助农民从事农业生产的朝中人民军队的战士们，热情地帮助各地缺乏劳动力的烈士家属、朝鲜人民军军人家属和农民们割草积肥。这种援助更加鼓舞了农民们的生产热情和支援前线争取更大胜利的信心。
