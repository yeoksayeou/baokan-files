The Party Life

    The Party Branch of Dazhai Village and the Zhang Zhiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative
    By Our Correspondent Miáo Fēng

    (I)
    As early as 1943, the Chinese Communist Party branch in Dazhai Village, Yúshè County, Shānxī Province, led the masses in fighting the enemy with guns in one hand and organizing to develop production in the other.
    Since 1943, production in Dazhai Village has developed rapidly, and the lives of the masses have improved significantly. Although some Communist Party members and the masses became complacent and developed ideas of "retreat" and "going it alone" in the middle, the branch promptly educated and corrected them. Later, the demands of the whole village increased. They felt that over the years, they had added children, raised daughters, and married wives, and the population had increased, and the demands of life had increased; however, the mutual aid teams were still using "old land and old planting methods," so everyone wanted to find ways to increase production. The branch knew that to continue to increase production, it was necessary to use new agricultural tools and continue to exploit the land's potential; it was necessary to "plant according to the land" and "fertilize according to the land." However, these methods were difficult to implement in mutual aid teams. For example, some had more cold soil but less hot fertilizer; or more hot soil but less cold fertilizer. Because the fertilizer could not be used in coordination with the land, it affected the increase in grain production. Zhāng Gēn jīn and Zhāng Wéi shēng said, "We also know that sowing and fertilizing should be careful, but there are no conditions, so we can only 'make do'."
    This contradiction became more acute year by year. At a branch party member meeting last spring, when mutual aid was discussed, a fierce debate broke out. At the meeting, there were roughly these two opinions:
    Some said, "If mutual aid doesn't work, let's break up!"
    Some said, "We have helped each other for several years, so we can't break up. Please ask the higher-ups to find a way for us."
    At this time, Zhāng Chāngfú, the secretary of the branch, explained to everyone that the difficulties encountered by the mutual aid team were difficulties in development and progress. He said, "We must solve this problem immediately and let the mutual aid team take a step forward. All of our Communist Party members should remember the Party's call, we must continue to help and cooperate with each other, we can't just rely on the higher-ups to find a way, every party member must find a way, we can't break up."
    After many discussions, and after requesting instructions from the Communist Party of Yúshè County Committee and obtaining approval, the direction was affirmed, and the Dazhai Village branch decided to try out an agricultural production cooperative.
    (II)
    The Dazhai Village branch adopted a very cautious attitude in the process of trying out the agricultural production cooperative. First, repeated discussions were held within the Party, and then the masses were mobilized to deliberate and discuss. After discussion, the branch found that the conditions for running a large agricultural production cooperative were not yet fully mature among the masses, because people with mountain land but no river beach land were afraid that the river beach land would have a poor harvest, causing them to suffer losses. Therefore, they advocated: "People with river beach land should run one cooperative, and people with mountain land should run one cooperative." From the branch's point of view, it also lacked experience in leading agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, the branch proposed to try out a small agricultural production cooperative in order to create experience. And it was decided that the branch secretary Zhāng Fúchāng and branch committee member Zhāng Zhìquán would personally participate in the leadership of the agricultural production cooperative. In this way, the small agricultural production cooperative was established.
    When it came time to harvest the crops, everyone saw that the agricultural production cooperative was indeed superior to the mutual aid team. The average yield per mu of land that had joined the cooperative was previously one stone and three dou, but now it yielded one stone, seven dou, and eight and a half sheng. Party members and the masses both happily said, "The branch's idea is good, this road is the right one." In order to expand the influence of the agricultural production cooperative, the branch systematically led Communist Party members and the masses to learn from the experience of Zhāng Zhìquán's trial agricultural production cooperative, as well as the experience of the Chuāndǐ Village agricultural production cooperative in Píngshùn County, Chángzhì Special District, and the experience of Soviet collective farms. After this, Zhāng Zhìquán's agricultural production cooperative expanded: from the original twenty-one households to forty-two households, and the land increased from the original twenty-two mu to five hundred and ninety-nine mu and eight fen. The problems that could not be solved in the mutual aid team, such as repairing river beach canals, improving agricultural technology, using new agricultural tools, and combining agriculture and sideline industries, were all solved by the agricultural production cooperative. This gave a model to the mutual aid team members and individual households who had not joined the cooperative: they should actively participate in the agricultural production cooperative and strive for a better future.
    (III)
    After the Zhāng Zhìquán agricultural production cooperative was established, only twelve Communist Party members from Dazhai village joined the "cooperative." The twenty-two Communist Party members scattered in three natural villages had not yet joined the "cooperative." Therefore, Liú Jīnwéi and others, party members from the Nánhédǐ natural village, also proposed to establish an agricultural production cooperative. After the branch committee made a detailed study of the situation in Nánhédǐ village, it considered that the conditions for establishing a "cooperative" in this village were not yet mature. They patiently explained to Liú Jīnwéi and others, and told them: "Now all party members should concentrate their efforts to run the Zhāng Zhìquán agricultural production cooperative well, and after gaining experience, then run other agricultural production cooperatives. Only in this way can we implement the 'only allow it to be run well, not allow it to be run badly' policy of the higher-level Party committee." Liú Jīnwéi and others felt that the branch's opinion was very reasonable and agreed to concentrate their efforts to run the Dazhai "cooperative" well first. In the future, they would not take detours when running their own "cooperative." In this way, the problem of other natural villages wanting to run "cooperatives" was also solved.
    In the process of leading the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, the Dazhai Village branch always firmly grasped the policy of "all party members running the cooperative, only allowing it to be run well, not allowing it to be run badly." After the Zhāng Zhìquán agricultural production cooperative was established, the branch specially convened a meeting to explain to the party members the principle of all party members running the cooperative. At the monthly branch meeting, the party group within the cooperative reported to all party members the work situation and problems of the cooperative in the past month, and asked everyone to put forward their opinions. In this way, all party members were very concerned about the Dazhai "cooperative," and were able to promptly reflect various situations and opinions, and help the branch and the party group within the cooperative run the agricultural production cooperative well.
    (IV)
    The Dazhai Village branch has become stronger in the process of leading the agricultural production cooperative. It can also lead the masses forward in a difficult environment. In July this year, a storm completely washed and pressed the good crops on the river beach land into the mud. At this time, the thinking of the cooperative members was extremely chaotic:
    People with mountain land but no river beach land said: "Joining the cooperative is a loss, we are implicated by people with river beach land, it's simply like 'wild chickens digging nests'!"
    People with river beach land said: "It's fortunate that we joined the cooperative! Otherwise, if the crops in the fields were washed away, we would have suffered a terrible loss."
    Some said: "Cooperation, cooperation, what's the use of cooperation! Chairman Mao can't control the weather for us, cooperation is useless!"
    Zhāng Zhìquán was clearly suffering from a cold before the heavy rain, but some cooperative members said that "the model worker is also sick."
    Some Communist Party members wanted to go to the fields to inspect the disaster. Some cooperative members said sarcastically: "It's all flattened, what's there to see, be careful you get washed away!"
    The county government instructed to register the reduced production. Some cooperative members said: "What's the use of registering! Even if we say there's a reduction of a thousand stone, the county can't give us grain!"
    People doing transportation didn't want to feed their animals anymore. Female cooperative members didn't do sanitation work anymore. Some cooperative members went to visit relatives; others were so angry that they slept all day. ...
    At this time, Zhāng Zhìquán hurriedly went to the fields with his illness to inspect the disaster and try to overcome this difficulty. Zhāng Zhìquán saw that many rice leaves were still exposed outside the mud, and believed that if they dug up the seedlings and supported them immediately, they could still save these crops. The branch agreed with Zhāng Zhìquán's opinion and convened a branch committee meeting, a branch meeting, and mobilized Communist Party members to lead the masses to carry out a seedling digging and supporting movement. The Zhāng Zhìquán cooperative also convened a meeting of cooperative member representatives, explaining in detail the methods of supporting and digging seedlings. After the meeting, Communist Party members, cooperative member representatives, Youth League members, and activists went to the masses to carry out propaganda and mobilization work. Within three days, forty-eight people were mobilized to dig and support seedlings in the fields. Four days later, they supported rice seedlings on one hundred and six mu of land. They also replanted black beans on the land where there were no seedlings at all. Soon, the washed-over rice and sorghum turned from yellow to green and became lush again. The replanted black bean seedlings also emerged from the soil.
    At this time, according to the branch's suggestion, the production cooperative convened a meeting of cooperative members, criticized those who had expressed negativity and complained about others, and asked everyone to resolutely and confidently run the agricultural production cooperative well. At the meeting, Zhāng Zhìquán also promoted the benefits of the production cooperative. He said: "This seedling digging and supporting movement tells us that we must help and cooperate with each other, if we hadn't cooperated, we would have been in big trouble if we had suffered a disaster." Communist Party members and cooperative members who had once expressed negativity, all automatically made self-criticisms at the meeting.
    Recently, cooperative member Zhāng Pǔxiǎo and others, when applying topdressing to the rice fields, laughed loudly when they saw the rice, which was as tall as their necks, and said happily: "Rice, if it weren't for the Communist Party members, you would be in danger, and so would we."
    (V)
    This summer, the branch led the Zhāng Zhìquán agricultural production cooperative to formulate a long-term construction plan for the future: within three years, strive for all farmers in the village to participate in the agricultural production cooperative, connect all the small pieces of flat land into large pieces, and build terraces on the mountain slopes, so that the village's agricultural production will be further improved. Plant a large number of trees on both sides of the river and canals, and require that within five years, the village will be self-sufficient in fuel, and within ten years, build buildings with its own timber. In addition, it also requires everyone to plant fruit trees, raise more sheep, pigs and chickens...
    Under the leadership of the branch, the party members and agricultural production cooperative members of Dazhai Village are building their beautiful lives with full confidence.

    大寨村党支部和张志全农业生产合作社
    本报记者　苗　风
    （一）
    远在一九四三年，山西省榆社县大寨村的中国共产党支部，就领导着群众一面拿枪打击敌人，一面组织起来发展生产。
    从一九四三年以来，大寨村的生产发展很快，群众生活有了显著的改善。中间虽然有一部分共产党员和群众曾因此自满，产生过“退坡”“单干”思想，但经支部及时教育纠正了。以后全村群众的要求提高，他们觉得，几年来添儿养女娶媳妇，人口增多了，生活要求提高了；可是互助组还是“老地老种法”，因此大家要求想法增产。支部知道要继续提高生产，就要使用新式农具，继续发挥土地的潜在能力；就要“因地播种”“因地施肥”。但是这些办法在互助组里很难行得通。例如有的是冷性地多，但是热性肥料少；或者热性地多而冷性肥料少。因为肥料不能配合土地使用，就影响了粮食的增产。张根金和张维生说：“咱也知道播种、施肥应该讲究，可是没条件，只能‘将就’些了。”
    这种矛盾一年比一年尖锐了。在去年春天的一次支部党员大会上，当讨论到互助问题时，就发生了激烈的争论。会上，大体有这两种意见：
    有的说：“互助不成散伙吧！”
    有的说：“咱们互助了好几年，不能散伙。请上级给咱想个办法。”
    这时，支部书记张昌福向大家说明：现在互助组遇到的困难，是发展和前进中的困难。他说：“咱们要马上解决这个问题，让互助组向前迈进一步。咱们共产党员都应当记得党的号召，一定要继续互助合作下去，不能光靠上级想办法，每个党员都要想办法，不能散伙。”
    经过多次的讨论，又经请示中共榆社县委批准，方向肯定下来了，大寨村支部决定试办农业生产合作社。
    （二）
    大寨村支部在试办农业生产合作社的过程中，采取了十分慎重的态度。首先在党内进行了反复讨论，然后又发动群众酝酿讨论。经过讨论，支部发现要办大的农业生产合作社，群众的条件还不完全成熟，因为有山地而没有河滩地的人害怕河滩地歉收，使自己吃亏。因此他们主张：“有河滩地的人办一个社，有山地的人办一个社。”从支部本身来说，也缺乏领导农业生产合作社的经验。因此，支部提出试办一个小型的农业生产合作社，以便创造经验。并决定由支部书记张福昌和支部委员张志全亲自参加农业生产合作社的领导工作。这样，小型的农业生产合作社就办起来了。
    到庄稼收获的时候，大家看到农业生产合作社确实优于互助组。入社的土地过去每亩平均产量是一石三斗，现在打了一石七斗八升五。党内外群众都高兴地说：“支部想的办法好，这条路走得对。”为了扩大农业生产合作社的影响，支部有计划地领导共产党员和群众学习了张志全试办农业生产合作社的经验，以及长治专区平顺县川底村农业生产合作社的经验、苏联集体农庄的经验。这以后，张志全的农业生产合作社扩大了：由原来的二十一户增加到四十二户，土地由原来的二十二亩，增加到五百九十九亩八分。在互助组里所不能解决的问题，如修河滩水渠、改进农业技术、使用新式农具、农业和副业结合等等问题，农业生产合作社都给一一解决了。这给没有入社的互助组员和单干户作出了一个样子：应当积极参加农业生产合作社，为美好的将来而奋斗。
    （三）
    张志全农业生产合作社办起来以后，只有大寨本村的十二个共产党员入了“社”。分散在三个自然村的二十二个共产党员还未入“社”。因此，南河底自然村的党员刘金维等也提出要办农业生产合作社。支委会对南河底村的情况作了详细的研究后，认为这村办“社”的条件还不成熟。就耐心地给刘金维等作了解释，并且告诉他们：“现在全体党员应当集中力量把张志全农业生产合作社办好，在取得经验以后，再办别的农业生产合作社。只有这样，才能贯彻上级党委的‘只许办好，不许办坏’的方针。”刘金维等觉得支部的意见很有道理，同意先集中力量办好大寨的“社”。将来自己办“社”时就不走弯路了。这样，其他自然村要求办“社”的问题也都随着解决。
    大寨村支部在领导创办农业生产合作社的过程中，始终紧紧地掌握了“全体党员办社，只许办好，不许办坏”的方针。张志全农业生产合作社成立后，支部专门召集大会向党员讲解了全体党员办社的道理。在每月的支部大会上，由社内的党的小组向全体党员报告一个月的社内工作情况和问题，请大家提出意见。这样全体党员对大寨的“社”都非常关心，都能够及时反映各方面的情况和意见，帮助支部和社内的党的小组办好农业生产合作社。
    （四）
    大寨村支部在领导农业生产合作社过程中，锻炼得更加坚强了。在严重的困难环境中，也能够领导群众前进。今年七月间，一场狂风暴雨，把河滩地的好庄稼全部冲压在泥土里了。这时社员的思想极为混乱：
    有山地而无河滩地的人说：“入社吃亏了，我们被有河滩地的人连累了，简直是给‘野鸡刨窝’哩！”
    有河滩地的人说：“亏了入社！要不地里庄稼被冲了，就亏死了。”
    有的说：“合作合作，合作顶甚！毛主席不给咱们管看老天爷，合作也没用！”
    张志全明明在大雨以前就患感冒，有的社员却说“劳动模范也气倒了”。
    有些共产党员要下地去察看灾情。有个别社员讽刺地说：“平啦，看甚，小心把你们冲走！”
    县政府指示登记一下减产的情况。有的社员说：“登记有什么用！就说减产一千石，县里也不能给咱发粮食呀！”
    搞运输的人也不想喂牲口了。女社员也不作卫生工作了。有的社员串亲戚去了；也有的气得整天睡大觉。……
    这时，张志全赶忙带病到地里察看灾情，想设法克服这个困难。张志全看到还有不少的谷叶子露在泥土外面，认为马上挖苗扶苗，还能救活这些庄稼。支部同意张志全的意见，召开了支委会、支部大会、动员共产党员带领群众开展挖苗扶苗运动。张志全合作社也召开了社员代表会议，详细讲明了扶苗挖苗的办法。会后，共产党员、社员代表、青年团员、积极分子分头深入群众进行宣传动员工作。三天内，动员了四十八人下地挖苗扶苗。四天以后，就扶起了一百零六亩地的谷苗。又在完全没苗的地上补种了黑豆。不久，被冲过的谷子、高粱由黄变绿，又茂盛起来。补种的黑豆苗也出土了。
    这时候，根据支部的建议，生产合作社召开了社员大会，对一度表示消极和埋怨别人的人进行了批评，要求大家坚决地、有信心地把农业生产合作社办好。在会上，张志全又宣传了生产合作社的好处。他说：“这次挖苗扶苗运动告诉咱们必须互助合作，要是咱们没有合作起来，遭了灾就了不得。”曾经一度表示消极的共产党员和社员，都自动在会上作了检讨。
    最近，社员张朴小等往谷地上追肥时，看到齐脖子高的谷子都大笑起来，高兴地说：“谷子呵，要不是共产党员，你危险，我们也危险。”
    （五）
    今年夏天，支部领导张志全农业生产合作社制订了今后长期的建设计划：在三年内，争取全村农民都参加农业生产合作社，把所有的小块平地都通成大块，山坡地修成梯田，使全村农业生产再提高一步。在河和水渠两边，大量种植树木，并要求在五年以后，做到全村燃料自给，十年以内，用自己的木材建筑楼房。此外还要求大家栽种果木树，多养羊、猪和鸡……
    大寨村的党员、农业生产合作社社员在支部的领导下，正在充满信心地建设着自己美好的生活。
