Qinghai provincial-level agencies have mostly established study plans and reorganized study groups, officially commencing studies in late July. By early August, county (city)-level agencies also began their studies one after another.

Generally speaking, leading cadres in various units are paying close attention to this political theory study. Comrades in the senior groups have generally formulated self-study plans in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and are able to diligently persist in their studies. In July, the senior groups focused on studying "On Contradiction" and have already held two discussion sessions. During the discussions, heated debates unfolded, combining with the issue of the direction of agricultural production development.

In addition to self-study, leading comrades from several units are actively leading the studies within their respective units. For example, responsible personnel from the Finance Department personally checked the study plans of the subordinate intermediate groups. Zhang Xiaoliang, the Secretary of the Xining Municipal Party Committee, personally gave a mobilization report for study to cadres throughout the city.

On the one hand, after the "Three-Anti" Movement, the general comrades have deeply realized the importance of study. Added to this, the leadership is paying close attention this time, so their enthusiasm for study is very high. The Salt Affairs Bureau established a library, and after work, most people go to find reference books to read.

Before the start of the study, some comrades participating in the elementary group study harbored thoughts of reaching for something too high too soon. They believed that "the Reader of Political Common Knowledge is not worth studying." A small number of comrades felt that being placed in the elementary group was "undignified," viewing study as a "political privilege." In addition, some comrades had thoughts of seeking quick results. In response to these ideological situations, some units conducted ideological criticism work. After this, some comrades saw that many leading cadres were learning humbly; at the same time, in the study, they realized that they only had a superficial understanding of many issues, only a smattering of knowledge, or even did not understand them at all, and so they became active.

### 青海省开展干部政治理论学习

    青海省开展干部政治理论学习
    青海省级各机关大都订出了学习计划，整顿了学习组织，在七月下旬正式开始学习。到八月初，县（市）级机关的学习也相继开始。
    一般说来，各单位的领导干部对这次的政治理论学习都很重视。高级组的同志一般都按省委指示订出了自学计划，而且都能认真坚持学习。七月份内，高级组以学习“矛盾论”为主，已举行过两次讨论会。在讨论中，曾结合农业生产发展的方向问题，展开了热烈的争辩。
    若干单位的领导同志除自学外，还积极领导本单位的学习，如财政厅的负责人员即亲自检查了所属中级组的学习计划。西宁市市委书记张效良亲自给全市干部作了学习动员报告。
    一般同志一方面经过“三反”运动已深刻地体会到学习的重要，加上这次领导方面抓得较紧，因之学习情绪很高。盐务局成立了图书室，工作完毕后，大部分人都去找参考书看。
    学习开始前，参加初级组学习的部分同志，存有好高鹜远的思想。认为“政治常识读本没学头”。少数同志认为编在初级组“不体面”，把学习当作“政治待遇”来看。另外有些同志有急于求成的思想。针对这些思想情况，有些单位作了思想批判工作。在这以后，一些同志看见许多领导干部都在虚心学习；同时在学习中又认识到有很多问题自己了解得浮皮潦草，只是一知半解，甚至根本不懂，也就积极起来了。
