    The Central Visiting Group has completed its visit to the ethnic minority areas of Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan.

    The Central Visiting Group began its visits to the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Suiyuan in mid-July, spending approximately forty days visiting the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan regions. The group successively visited all six leagues of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and two leagues, three banners, and two cities of Suiyuan Province, traveling a total of more than 15,000 *li*. Wherever the visiting group went, it combined the welcome rallies of the local people with holding consolation meetings, convening symposiums of representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, and conducting individual visits deep into the countryside, grasslands, and factories. During these activities, the visiting group directly met with more than 348,000 people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan regions. The visiting group conveyed the deep concern of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao for all ethnic minorities to the people of all ethnic groups, and presented banners, souvenirs, and a large number of cultural, educational, and health supplies. At the same time, Sa Kongliao, the deputy head of the visiting group, gave five reports on ethnic policy to the working cadres in various places; the medical team provided free medical treatment to more than 7,500 farmers and herdsmen of various ethnic groups; and the projection team also showed films and slides to more than 380,000 viewers.

    The Central Visiting Group received a warm welcome from the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan. When visiting the Ikezhao League in Suiyuan, Mongolian herdsmen from Tonggulang District of Zhasake Banner drove cattle and horses and brought tents to Ijin Holo to welcome the visiting group. When the visiting group arrived at Bailing Temple, Wudangzhao, Kundulunzhao and other places in Ulanqab League, the Mongolian people excitedly said: It is really unexpected that representatives of Chairman Mao can come to such remote places as ours. When departing, a herdsman woman from Wudangzhao held the hand of the head of the visiting group and requested that the visiting group be able to come again after returning to Beijing. When the people of various ethnic minorities met with the visiting group, the first sentence was always to ask about Chairman Mao's health. In order to repay Chairman Mao's concern, the people of all ethnic groups expressed their determination to do a good job in production. The herdsmen of the Sixth *Zuo* (i.e., district) of the Western United Banner of Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia are determined to organize livestock mutual aid groups to improve livestock production. An old Mongolian lady named Su Nuomu heard that the visiting group was coming, and specially held her granddaughter, who had just turned one year old, and rushed to the League People's Government to present the first pot of happy wine (mare's milk wine) to Puntsok, the deputy head of the visiting group. She gratefully shed tears and said: "Our grassland is prosperous with people and livestock, all thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao." The Mongolian and Hui people in other places also expressed to the visiting group that they would guarantee to do a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and wrote letters of salute to Chairman Mao, presented banners, Mongolian costumes, *hada*, Hui hats and other noble gifts.
