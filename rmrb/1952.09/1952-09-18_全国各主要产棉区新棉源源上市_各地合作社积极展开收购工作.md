New cotton from major cotton-producing areas nationwide is continuously entering the market, and cooperatives in various regions are receiving new cotton in accordance with the cotton pre-purchase contracts signed with mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. They are also actively purchasing new cotton from the broad masses of cotton farmers who want to sell.

This year, cotton harvests are bountiful across the country, and the maturity period is half a month earlier than last year. Currently, the vast number of cotton farmers are joyfully picking the first flush of cotton and selling it to the state. On August 31st, the Dezhou Prefecture Cooperative in Shandong Province purchased 140,000 jin of seed cotton in a single day. In the Hebei cotton-producing area, new cotton was available on the market in mid-August, and by the end of the month, cooperatives in only the Handan and Shijiazhuang Prefectures had purchased over 9 million jin of seed cotton. New cotton has also generally entered the market in provinces such as Pingyuan, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Liaodong, and Liaoxi, and local cooperatives have also successively launched procurement work.

This year, the state has entrusted cooperatives to contract for cotton purchases. According to the agreement between the former Central Ministry of Trade and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for purchasing cotton on behalf of the state, the funds for purchasing cotton this year are to be advanced by the cooperatives through their own loans. From the purchase of seed cotton to ginning, packing, transportation, and delivery, the cooperatives operate independently and are responsible for their own profits and losses. This strengthens the sense of responsibility of cooperative cadres for their work, enabling them to actively improve their operating techniques, be meticulous in their calculations, save expenses, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce cotton losses.

The current problems in cotton purchasing work are: cooperatives have underestimated the amount of new cotton entering the market and have prepared insufficient funds for purchasing cotton, and are therefore unable to meet the needs of cotton farmers who want to sell. For example, in Cheng'an and Linzhang counties in Handan Prefecture, Hebei, the daily amount of new cotton entering the market recently totaled 60,000 jin, but the purchasing funds prepared by the cooperatives could only purchase more than 20,000 jin. This situation also exists in other regions. Secondly, some cooperatives have not prepared enough supplies of goods needed by cotton farmers. Before the new cotton came on the market, cooperatives in various regions generally made plans to supply goods. With the new cotton coming on the market, various materials are being supplied. In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, in conjunction with the purchasing work, more than 5 million jin of fertilizer, 600,000 chi of fine cloth, and a large amount of grain have been supplied in half a month. However, there are still many regions where cooperatives have not reported supply plans in a timely manner, and although some lower-level cooperatives have made plans, the higher-level cooperatives have not allocated the materials in a timely manner, so that after the new cotton has come on the market, they cannot promptly meet cotton farmers' needs for means of production and livelihood. Currently, the amount of new cotton entering the market is increasing day by day, and if the above problems cannot be quickly resolved, it will inevitably hinder cotton purchasing work.

The work of purchasing cotton is a very complex and meticulous work. Cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas must carry out this work with all their strength under the unified leadership and close cooperation of the local financial and economic committees and relevant departments, and should pay attention to implementing the cotton price policy of "high price for high-quality cotton, low price for low-quality cotton."

In order to implement the economic accounting system, cooperatives in various regions are preparing to launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy in cotton purchasing work. The North China District Cooperative has also drafted specific competition conditions, planning to increase production and save 34.8 billion yuan.

### 全国各主要产棉区新棉源源上市  各地合作社积极展开收购工作

    全国各主要产棉区新棉源源上市
    各地合作社积极展开收购工作
    全国各主要产棉区新棉源源上市，各地合作社正按照和互助组、农业生产合作社签订的预购棉花合同，接收新棉，并积极收购广大棉农群众要求出售的新棉。
    今年各地棉花丰收，成熟期且较去年提早半个月。目前，广大棉农正在欢欣喜悦地摘取头喷花卖给国家。山东德州专区合作社在八月三十一日一天当中就收购了十四万斤籽棉。河北棉产区八月中旬新花即已上市，到下旬为止，仅邯郸、石家庄两个专区的合作社就收购了九百多万斤籽棉。平原、山西、河南、湖北、浙江、辽东、辽西等省新棉也都普遍上市，当地合作社也相继展开收购工作。
    今年国家委托合作社包收棉花。根据前中央贸易部和全国合作总社代购棉花协议的规定，今年收购棉花的资金由合作社自行贷款垫付。从收购籽棉到轧花、打包、运输直至交货，都由合作社独立经营，自负盈亏责任。这样就加强了合作社干部对工作的责任心，使他们能够积极提高经营技术，精打细算，节省开支，加速资金周转，减低棉花损耗。
    目前收棉工作中的问题是：合作社对新棉上市量估计不足，准备的购棉款较少，因而不能满足售棉群众的要求。例如，河北邯郸专区成安、临漳两县近来每日新花上市量共为六万斤，但合作社准备的购棉资金只能收两万多斤。这种情况在其它地区也存在着。其次，有些合作社准备的实物不敷棉农的需要。各地合作社在新花上市前，大都做了供应实物的计划，随着新花上市，正在供应各种物资。石家庄专区结合收购工作，在半个月中，已经供应了五百多万斤肥料、六十万尺细布和大批粮食。但是，还有不少地区的合作社没有及时上报供应计划，有些下级社虽然做了计划，但上级社没有及时拨发实物，以致在新棉上市后，不能及时满足棉农对生产资料和生活资料的需求。目前，新棉上市量日渐增加，上述问题如不能迅速解决，必将妨碍收棉工作。
    收购棉花工作是一个很复杂很细致的工作，各产棉区合作社必须在当地财政经济委员会及有关部门的统一领导和密切配合下，全力进行这一工作，并应注意贯彻“优棉优价，低棉低价”的棉价政策。
    为了贯彻经济核算制，各地合作社准备在收购棉花工作中开展一个群众性的增产节约运动。华北区合作社并已拟出了具体的竞赛条件，计划增产节约三百四十八亿元。
