An Accurate Mortar
    Lin Mai

    "Our blocking line is the enemy's death line!" The heroes of the Second Artillery of a certain artillery unit on the Korean front often mocked the enemy like this. They are artillerymen of a heavy mortar company of our army. In more than five months of blocking warfare in the eastern part of the central front, they killed and wounded more than 350 enemies with more than 200 shells, without suffering any casualties themselves.

    First artilleryman Song Hanyun proudly told me: "The American aggressor troops fire thousands of shells at our positions every day, but they can't even touch a hair on our heads; while every one of our shells costs them several or dozens of lives." The battle records of this heavy mortar company confirmed what Song Hanyun said. The battle record of November 17th last year reads:

    "Today the enemy fired more than 2,000 shells of various calibers at our infantry and artillery positions, and we suffered no casualties. Our Second Artillery killed and wounded more than 40 enemy soldiers with nine shells today." The battle situation on this day was as follows: More than two platoons of enemy troops advanced towards our positions in two routes under the cover of smoke. Our sharpshooter Chen Biao calmly aimed and fired nine consecutive shots, all hitting the enemy on the left flank, killing and wounding more than forty enemies. An enemy recoilless gun and a heavy machine gun were also destroyed in the ditch. The enemy on the right flank was also frightened and fled in panic.

    The artillerymen continued to kill and wound a large number of enemies with a small number of shells in this way. After each battle, they carefully summarized their experiences and further improved their tactics and techniques, making their shooting more and more accurate. On the position, they studied the map every day, marking out directions and distances, and marked every position and road that the enemy might come from very accurately. Once the infantry needed their cooperation and support, they could immediately bombard the enemy with unerring accuracy. On January 29th of this year, the enemy gathered more than one battalion of troops and, under the cover of nine tanks, detoured towards us in three routes, attempting to occupy a certain high ground of ours. Only six infantry comrades of our army were defending the high ground. When the enemy detoured to the mountainside, the enemy's platoon of guns also densely fired at our position. At this time, our mortars fired twenty consecutive shells, all hitting the enemy group, and drove this enemy force back in a chaotic manner. The soldiers guarding the mountain applauded and cheered: "Our Second Artillery is doing a great job..." Before long, the enemy pieced together more than two squads of troops and attacked the mountain top; our six soldiers on the mountain were ordered to temporarily withdraw to the mountainside. When our artillery turned to fire at the mountain top occupied by the enemy, these six soldiers immediately launched a counterattack on the mountain top, annihilating all the enemies on the mountain and capturing an enemy platoon leader alive.

    In this battle, the Second Artillery and these six brave soldiers stubbornly repelled several attacks by more than one battalion of the enemy under the cover of nine tanks, killing and wounding more than 100 enemy soldiers.

    The artillerymen not only often defeated the enemy's attacks, but sometimes also took the initiative to cut them off before the enemy's claws of attack had even been extended. One day, on the enemy's position opposite, four American officers were pointing and gesturing with maps in front of a bunker, planning an attack. Sharpshooter Chen Biao saw it and immediately aimed and fired a shot, frightening several enemy officers into the bunker. He quickly corrected the distance, and the second shell hit the bunker squarely. Immediately following, the third and fourth shells flew over, and the bunker was destroyed, and several guys were buried in this bunker. One day at dawn, the comrades in the observation post discovered that eight enemy tanks were hidden in a trench, preparing to cover the infantry's charge. The Second Artillery immediately started firing at this group of tanks, injuring two of them at once. The remaining tanks hurriedly dragged the two injured tanks away, and the enemy infantry followed and fled back.

    The comrades of the heroic Second Artillery, together with other artillery comrades, are fighting victoriously on the front line in this way. When they were wearing the dazzling "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative medal, they excitedly wrote a letter of thanks to the people of the motherland. The letter read: "Today we are wearing the glorious "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative medal, and we feel unspeakably happy and grateful. Here, we solemnly swear to the motherland: We will definitely strike the enemy more bravely and accurately, and fight to the end to defend the motherland and defend peace!"

    一门准确的迫击炮
    林脉
    “我们的阻击线，就是敌人的死亡线！”朝鲜前线某炮兵部队第二炮的英雄们时常这样嘲笑敌人。他们是我军某部重迫击炮连的炮兵。在中线东部五个多月的阻击战中，他们以二百多发炮弹，杀伤敌人三百五十多名，而自己无一伤亡。
    一炮手宋汉云自豪地对我说：“美国侵略军每天向我们阵地发射几千发炮弹，但它连我们一根汗毛也动不了；而我们每发炮弹，却要换他几条或几十条命。”这个重迫击炮连的战况记录证实了宋汉云说的话。去年十一月十七日的战况记录中这样写着：
    “今天敌人用各种口径的重炮向我步炮阵地发射了两千多发炮弹，我无一伤亡。我第二炮今天以九发炮弹，即杀伤敌军四十余人。”这一天的战斗情况是这样的：敌人有两个多排的兵力，在烟幕中分两路向我阵地进犯。我神炮手陈彪沉着瞄准，连射九发，全部命中左翼的敌人，四十多个敌人全部被杀伤，敌人的一门无后座力炮和一挺重机枪也被击毁在田沟里。右翼的敌人，也吓得狼狈逃跑了。
    炮手们就是这样不断地以少量炮弹杀伤众多的敌人。在每次战斗以后，他们都认真总结经验，进一步提高战术和技术，使他们的射击一次比一次准确。在阵地上，他们每天研究地图，标定出方向、距离，把每一个阵地和敌人可能来犯的道路都标定得非常精确，一旦当步兵需要他们配合和支援时，他们就能立即弹无虚发地向敌人轰击。今年一月二十九日，敌人集结了一个多营的兵力，在九辆坦克的掩护下，分三路向我迂回过来，企图占领我某高地，而我军坚守该高地的只有六位步兵同志。当敌人迂回到半山腰时，敌人的排炮也密集地向我阵地射击。这时候，我们的迫击炮连续发射了二十发炮弹，全部命中敌群，把这一股敌人打得七零八落地跑回去了。守在山上的战士们鼓掌欢呼：“我们第二炮，打得呱呱叫……。”不一会，敌人又拚凑了两个多班的兵力，攻上了山头；我们山上的六位战士奉命暂时撤到山腰。当我们的炮兵转向敌人占领的山头射击时，这六位战士立即又向山头发起反击，将山上的敌人全部歼灭，还活捉了敌军一个排长。
    这次战斗，第二炮和这六个英勇战士，顽强地打垮了敌人一个多营在九辆坦克掩护下的数次进攻，杀伤敌军一百多人。
    炮兵们不仅常常打垮敌人的进攻，有时并且还主动地在敌人进攻的魔爪还没有伸出来的时候就斩断它。有一天，对面敌人阵地上，有四个美国军官正在一座地堡口上拿着地图指手划脚布置进攻。神炮手陈彪看见了，立刻瞄准打了一发，几个敌人军官吓得逃进了地堡。他又迅速地修正了距离，第二发炮弹就不歪不斜地正打在地堡上，紧接着第三、第四发炮弹飞过去，这个地堡就被击毁，几个家伙就被埋葬在这地堡里。又有一天拂晓，观测所的同志们发现敌人八辆坦克隐蔽在一条沟里，准备掩护步兵冲锋。第二炮立即就对准这群坦克打起来，一下子就打伤了两辆，其余的坦克慌忙拖着这两辆受伤的坦克溜走了，敌人的步兵也跟着逃了回去。
    英雄的第二炮的同志们和其他的炮兵同志们在一起，就这样在前线胜利地战斗着。当配戴上光彩夺目的抗美援朝纪念章的时候，他们兴奋地给祖国人民写了一封感谢信，信上写道：“今天我们戴上了光荣的抗美援朝纪念章，心里真有说不出的高兴和感激，这里，我们谨向祖国宣誓：我们一定更勇敢、更准确地打击敌人，为了保卫祖国、保卫和平而坚强不息地战斗到底！”
