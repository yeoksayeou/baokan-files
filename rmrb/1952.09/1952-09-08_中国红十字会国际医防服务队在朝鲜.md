    China Red Cross International Medical and Preventive Service Team in Korea
    Dongfang Ming
    Inspired by the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism, the China Red Cross International Medical and Preventive Service Team formed seven medical and preventive detachments, including internal medicine, orthopedics, thoracic surgery, abdominal surgery, oral surgery, otolaryngology, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, infectious diseases, and epidemic prevention, and went to the front line of the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea. In the nearly one and a half years of hard work, the team members displayed a high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary humanitarianism, working day and night with all their energy, skills, and wisdom to serve the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the wounded and sick of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Their work encouraged the fighting will of the anti-aggression soldiers, strengthened the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and made a great contribution to the cause of defending peace.
    In March 1951, the first detachment crossed the Yalu River, followed by one team after another joining the epidemic prevention and medical work in the front and rear of Korea. They overcame a series of difficulties. During the day, enemy planes bombed and strafed from time to time, so they moved at night; when roads and bridges were destroyed by the enemy, they detoured and waded across the icy streams; when cities were bombed into ruins, they set up tents and lived in the mountains and forests. The heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers moved them, justice and truth supported them, and the conviction that the anti-aggression war would be won encouraged them!
    In the war zones close to the front lines, under the slogan of "Everything for the wounded and sick," the team members used the only spare time in their daily work to move stones, cut down trees, collect shrapnel and the wreckage of enemy planes, and built operating rooms, elevating operating tables, bathrooms, treatment rooms, infusion stands, and many other medical appliances and equipment with their own hands. The seventh detachment also built sickrooms that could accommodate more than a thousand wounded and sick soldiers. Nursing work at the front was also arduous. Every day, the nurses bathed the wounded, rinsed their mouths, washed their faces, collected their excrement and urine, changed their bedding, or fed them. In the cold nights, they also had to make fires to keep them warm. After their tense work, the female team members went to the river in temperatures of minus 30 degrees to wash clothes and dressings for the wounded and sick; late at night, they sat under the lights and mended shoes and socks for the wounded soldiers.
    The team members always tried their best to rescue soldiers whose lives were hanging by a thread from the hands of the god of death. For example, in a ward of the seventh detachment, a young Korean People's Army soldier named Li Jishou was on the verge of death due to excessive blood loss. Nurse Gao Jingxia transfused 450 cc of blood, turning him from danger to safety. Comrades Xu Daoan, Wu Dezhen, Wang Yizhi, and Huang Xianhua, members of the Youth League of the fifth detachment, also collectively transfused 1,000 cc of blood, saving the life of wounded soldier Su Yuanxiang. The members of the medical and preventive service team were prepared to donate their blood once, twice, or even more times to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who were shedding blood to defend their motherland and world peace. In the operating room, doctors and nurses worked day and night to perform emergency surgery and rescue the wounded and sick. Doctor Wang Qingchun rushed to the front from Pyongyang on foot to rescue the seriously wounded, and joined the work without rest, performing more than 40 major and minor operations in ten days and ten nights. Although Doctor Shen Zemin injured his leg on the journey, he still limped into every ward to understand the lives and conditions of the wounded and sick. Examples like this are too numerous to mention.
    The China Red Cross International Medical and Preventive Service Team also treated the victims, the sick, and the prisoners of war in the war with the spirit of humanitarianism. Some of the team members went deep into the prisoner-of-war camps to serve those who had lost their resistance. They not only paid great attention to the environmental hygiene and infectious disease management of the camps, but also provided the prisoners of war with rich food and other daily necessities, and established clubs for them, which were equipped with various musical instruments and toys, so that the sick prisoners of war could lead appropriate cultural and recreational lives. They also helped and educated the prisoners of war to improve their personal hygiene and correct their bad habits of laziness, dependence, selfishness, and indiscriminate defecation. When epidemics were discovered in the camps, they immediately steamed and washed the prisoners' clothes and bedding, implemented isolation, and used advanced Soviet medicine to cure their war wounds and chronic diseases that had not healed for many years. None of the sick prisoners living in the prisoner-of-war camps did not feel the kindness of the Chinese doctors. Prisoner of war Thomson said when leaving the hospital: "In my whole life, I have never seen any American doctor as kind and responsible as the Chinese doctors. I have never seen an army so lenient to prisoners of war." Prisoner of war Harrobin also wrote a letter thanking the Chinese Red Cross. He said: "In the hospital, I received the best medical treatment, and almost everything I wanted to do was approved. I will take these pleasant memories back to tell the people of all Britain, and also tell them about the noble character and goodwill of the Chinese people."... (Attached picture)

    中国红十字会国际医防服务队在朝鲜
    东方明
    中国红十字会国际医防服务队，在革命人道主义精神的鼓舞下，先后组成了包括内科、骨科、胸腔科、腹腔外科、口腔外科、五官科、普通外科、矫形外科、传染病科、防疫科的七个医防大队，走向抗美援朝的前线。在近一年半的艰苦时日中，队员们发挥了高度的爱国主义、国际主义和革命人道主义的精神，日以继夜地以全付精力、技术和智慧，为朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军伤病员服务。他们的工作鼓舞了反侵略战士的战斗意志，加强了中朝人民牢不可破的友谊，对保卫和平的事业作了巨大的贡献。
    一九五一年三月，第一大队首先跨过了鸭绿江，紧接着一队又一队参加了朝鲜前后方的防疫和医疗工作。他们克服了一连串的困难。白天，敌机不时来轰炸和扫射，他们就在夜间行动；公路和桥梁被敌人破坏了，他们就绕道涉过刺骨的溪河；城市被炸成了废墟，他们就搭起帐篷住在山地里和森林里。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇战斗感动了他们，正义和真理支持着他们，反侵略战争的必胜信念鼓舞着他们！
    在接近火线的战地里，在“一切为了伤病员”的口号下，队员们利用每天工作中仅有的空余时间，搬运石块，砍伐树木，搜集弹片和敌机的残骸，用自己的双手修建起手术室、升降手术台、洗浴室、治疗室、输液架，以及其他许许多多的医疗用具和设备。第七大队并建筑起可以容纳一千余名伤病员的病室。前线的护理工作同样是一件艰苦的工作。护士们每天给伤员洗澡，漱口，洗脸，接屎接尿，换被褥，或者给他们喂食物。在寒冷的夜里，还得给他们烧火取暖。女队员们在紧张的工作之后，在零下三十度的天气，到河边为伤病员们拆洗衣服和敷料；深夜里她们还坐在灯下为伤员们缝补着鞋袜。
    队员们总是想尽一切的办法把生命危在旦夕的战士从死神的手里抢救出来。例如在第七大队的某一病房里，一位年青的朝鲜人民军伤员李吉洙，因失血过多而处于濒死状态。护士郜静霞同志输血四百五十公撮，使他转危为安。第五大队的青年团员徐道安、吴德桢、王一之、黄仙华等同志也曾集体输血一千公撮，挽救了伤员苏元祥的生命。医防服务队的队员们都准备着一次、二次，以至更多次地把自己的鲜血献给为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而流血的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。在手术室里，大夫和护士们日以继夜地忙着做急救手术，抢救伤病员。王庆春大夫为了抢救重伤员，从平壤徒步赶到前方，没有休息就参加了工作，在十天十夜中接连进行了四十多次大小手术。沈泽民大夫虽然在旅途中伤了腿，可是他仍然一拐一拐地跑进每一个病室，了解伤病员的生活和病况。诸如此类的例子举不胜举。
    中国红十字会国际医防服务队，同样以人道主义的精神对待战争中的罹难者、病人和战俘。有一部分队员深入到战俘营里，为那些失去了抵抗力的人服务。他们不仅对营地里的环境卫生和传染病的管理予以极大的注意，并且供给战俘以丰富的饮食，和其他生活必需品，并为他们建立了俱乐部，里面设有各种乐器和玩具，使患病的战俘过着适当的文化娱乐生活。他们还帮助和教育战俘搞好个人卫生，纠正他们偷懒、依赖、自私和随地便溺的恶习。营地里发现了流行病，他们就马上为战俘蒸洗衣被，实行隔离，并以先进的苏联医学治愈了他们的战伤和长年未愈的痼疾。生活在俘虏营里的病俘，没有一个不感到中国大夫的亲切。战俘汤姆生在离开病院时说：“我一生一世从未见过任何一个美国医生像中国医生这样的仁慈和负责任。更未见过对战俘这样宽大的军队。”战俘哈洛宾并写信感谢中国红十字会。他说：“在病院里，我得到最好的药品治疗，凡是我所想做的事情差不多都被批准了，我将把这些愉快的回忆带回去告诉全英国的人民，并把中国人民高尚的品德和善意也告诉他们。”……（附图片）
