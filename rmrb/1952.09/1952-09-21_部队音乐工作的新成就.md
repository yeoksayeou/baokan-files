The success of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's "August 1st" Army Day Sports Meet Arts Competition is of great significance for the development of future literary and artistic work. It will not only have a huge impact on the army's literary and artistic work and promote literary and artistic workers in the troops to further carry out literary and artistic activities in companies and create more excellent works reflecting the heroic troops' combat life; at the same time, it will vigorously promote literary and artistic workers outside the troops to delve into the lives of the masses, conscientiously transform themselves, and earnestly serve the people.

From the musical point of view, after five days of competition, the mood every day was so full and cheerful. The vivid images of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, their heroic deeds, and happy lives were all displayed before our eyes. In particular, the excellent programs written and sung by the soldiers themselves made us excited, moved, proud, and honored.

The competition tells us that, under the leadership of superiors, the music workers in the troops have implemented Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, inherited the musical tradition of the People's Army, and implemented the policy of "facing the company, serving the soldiers," and "comprehensively developing the combat effectiveness and mass character of the People's Liberation Army's cultural and artistic work," and have achieved new accomplishments.

The mass marching songs of the troops have made progress in ideological content, emotional depth, life embodiment, and national style compared to the past. For example, "I Am a Soldier" from the Central South Military Region comprehensively expresses the revolutionary heroism of the People's Liberation Army. It shows that our soldiers are tested by war, have a firm stand, are proud of their posts, are full of optimism and confidence in victory, and are highly vigilant defenders of the motherland and guardians of world peace. The lyrics and music are closely integrated, the melody is smooth, the rhythm is clear, and the musical language is elevated from folk music. It has both revolutionary heroism and national style. The soldiers love it, and it quickly spread. "I Love My Motherland" from the Central South Military Region expresses the inherent feelings of the National Defense Army soldiers who love the great motherland and love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. They see the construction of the motherland today and the even better future of the motherland and are determined to defend our motherland. The melody is full of enthusiasm and has a touching power. The soldiers can understand, accept, and resonate with it. It is a pity that the lyrics are not very satisfactory and are relatively conceptual. "Bayonet Song" from the East China Military Region sings about the feelings of the people's soldiers for cherishing weapons, regarding weapons as their close comrades-in-arms, cherishing them, sharpening them, and always preparing to exert their effectiveness. The mood of the lyrics and music is unified. The melody uses and elevates folk music language. It has both national style and the characteristics of the troops. It is energetic to sing and easy to remember. It is a revolutionary optimistic song.

Narrative singing has seen new developments and achievements in the troops. It has grown out of actual combat life. Rich life content and love for the motherland and heroes have broken through the shackles of old forms and become fresh, lively, vigorous, and highly contagious new narrative singing music that everyone loves. For example, Shandong Kuaishu "Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa" by Volunteer soldier Comrade Liu Peng is a glorious poem praising heroes. It prominently expresses the character of the characters and the image of the heroes. The thought is clear, the plot is realistic, and the language is vivid. The audience seems to see with their own eyes how Han Qifa bravely and cleverly captured the officers of the American invading army. Comrade Wang Fengming's "Speaking of the Flood Storage Area" from the Central South Military Region was written by the author (originally a soldier, now working in the song and dance troupe). This year, he went to the scene of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area and vividly described the scale and significance of this great construction project of the motherland with a high degree of patriotism through the self-description of the flood storage area. The People's Liberation Army and the workers and peasants worked together and overcame any difficulties, demonstrating the great power of building the motherland and a high degree of patriotism.

The above are just a few examples of many excellent works, illustrating that the music workers in the troops can have so many gains, on the one hand, due to the party's cultivation and education, and on the other hand, due to delving into the lives of the companies, transforming themselves, understanding the soldiers' thoughts and feelings, and lofty qualities, using and creating national musical language, and saying what the soldiers have in their hearts. At the same time, it also shows that our people's troops have a glorious musical tradition and unlimited creative power. The soldiers have strong creative abilities, and their works are full of new emotions, new language, and new life. Music workers should humbly learn from these works, learn from these authors, learn their understanding, attitude, and observation methods of troop life, learn their writing experience, and learn their collectivistic language elevated from the folk and enriched by combat life. This will greatly help us to correctly reflect troop life and correctly depict the inner activities and images of heroic figures.

Through this music competition, we can see several characteristics in singing: first, full of emotion; second, clear enunciation; and third, a national style. This is more advanced than any large-scale concert after entering the city. For example, Comrade Wang Fengming, originally a farmer, had worked in a factory and loved to listen to storytelling and opera music when he was a child. After joining the revolutionary troops, combat life tempered him, and the party and superiors patiently cultivated him. In addition, he continued to study hard, and he gradually became able to compose and sing smoothly. At the competition, when he sang his self-composed "Speaking of the Flood Storage Area" and "Lu Xiangyun Fighting Warships," he was full of emotion, pronounced correctly, his voice was loud, and the national language, every word, was clearly heard, and could move the hearts of the audience. Comrade Meng Guibin did not originally grow up in Tibet, but he sang the true feelings of the Tibetan compatriots who love the People's Liberation Army. Because he worked in the southwest and got along with the Tibetan compatriots like relatives, he accepted the sincere emotional edification of the Tibetan compatriots and realized that the Tibetan compatriots sing with "emotion and singing integrated into one." After repeated learning from the Tibetan compatriots, the singing of the Tibetan compatriots became his own singing. In addition, the singing of Comrades Cao Jiading, Xing Sufen, Xiang Yang, Zhou Daxin, Feng Kenan, and Cui Yongchang can basically express the content of the songs. And they showed diverse and distinctive national styles. The audience felt kind and lovely, and felt that this was the singing art of their own nation. Therefore, I thought of some comrades who have studied Western vocal music. When they sing Chinese songs, why do the audience feel unkind and unlovely, and feel that it is not the singing art of their own nation? The fundamental problem is that these comrades do not understand or do not work hard to deeply understand the lives of the masses politically and ideologically, do not accept the emotional edification of the working people, and do not humbly inherit the excellent traditions of national singing art, but one-sidedly circle around in form, technique, and special tastes. When Comrade Cui Yongchang sang "Three Sets of Yellow Cattle and One Set of Horses," he could teach us to understand the happy mood of the peasants who actively produce after turning over. The hardworking peasants and rural scenery seemed to appear before our eyes. But when we hear another comrade sing the same song in Shanghai records, we will immediately know that the singer lacks experience in rural life and lacks understanding of the peasants who have turned over. Although the voice is loud, the scales are accurate, and the intensity is appropriate, he cannot sing the life of the countryside, and he cannot sing the emotions of the peasants who have turned over, so he cannot achieve the purpose of correctly singing this work. Everyone knows that many outstanding singers and opera actors in the Soviet Union have the highest level of singing art in the world, but we must not forget that they are the inheritors of the excellent traditions of Soviet singing art, and they maintain constant close contact with the masses. This fact clearly tells us that improved vocal art must have the feelings of the people, national characteristics, and style. Therefore, if we want to solve the problem of improving the singing art of the troops, the main thing is to further understand life, connect with the masses, and learn critically from the best singers and best opera artists of the working people on the basis of the correct singing art of this competition; secondly, to critically absorb the advanced singing art experience of foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union, in order to give full play to the greatest possibilities of the singing art of the motherland. After listening to many songs in this competition, we should have a clear understanding of the long-debated issue of true voice and false voice or true sound and false sound. Chinese folk singing originally used both true and false voices. Why must we use true voices instead of false voices now? On the other hand, why must we insist that false voice is scientific and true voice is not scientific? The voice is a tool for expressing thoughts and feelings. Whatever voice is needed should be used, as long as it can correctly and fully express the true thoughts and feelings, real life, language characteristics, and national style of the song, and is loved by the masses and recognized as the singing art of their own nation, then it is scientific and national. Therefore, the fundamental problem that vocal artists from intellectual backgrounds must solve first is the problem of thought, emotion, and stand. If this problem is solved, the remaining problems will also be solved correctly. Chairman Mao said: "Our literary and artistic workers from intellectual backgrounds, in order to make their works welcome by the masses, must change their thoughts and feelings and undergo a transformation. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be incompatible." "Our literary and artistic workers must accomplish this task, must move their butts over, must gradually move over to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the process of delving into the workers, peasants, and soldiers and delving into actual struggle, in the process of studying Marxism-Leninism and studying society. Only in this way can we have truly for workers, peasants, and soldiers literary and art." (Chairman Mao's Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art). If we can resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, go deep into the struggle life of the masses to transform ourselves, resolutely stand on the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly maintain close contact with the masses, and humbly learn from our country's traditional singing art, and combine the wisdom of the masses with our own, then our singing art will surely be welcomed by the masses and will surely have a bright future.

There have also been new creations in collective singing. The North China Military Region's performance of "Heroic Automobile Drivers" is a good example. The fresh and lively performance is consistent with the content of the song, and the image of the automobile drivers bravely and cleverly defeating enemy aircraft bombing on the Korean front is depicted. Many people believe that this form of performance is worth promoting, because various forms of performance can greatly liven up troop life. However, when creating and performing, it is necessary to pay attention to not excessively pursuing the form of performance and ignoring the quality of song creation, and not to win the soldiers' favor solely from the form of performance, so as to avoid formalism. I think the most important thing is to write the song well, and the performance action must be appropriately combined with the content and form of the song, otherwise it will make the audience feel unclear about the content of the song, weaken the power of the music, or cause a sense of disunity. For example, the performance form of "One Bullet, One Bag of Sugar" is not appropriate. Wearing a volunteer uniform on the stage, looking left and right, seeing children being bombed and strafed by enemy aircraft and just being anxious, the audience will immediately feel, why not rush over to rescue them? The audience thinks that this is not directly expressing the image of a heroic figure, but a form of performance with a bystander attitude.

Instrumental music creation and the use of musical instruments have had some experience in the troops. We listened to the music of "Road Building Dance" and felt healthy and energetic, which helped the emotional expression of the dance. Listening to the music of "Army and People Threshing Highland Barley," we felt intimacy, joy, and distinct national characteristics. Listening to the music of "Marine Corps Dance," we felt pleasant and smooth, which helped the audience develop a favorable impression of the dance. When the solo song "Singing Erlang Mountain" was sung, the accompaniment and the singing were harmonious, the national style was unified, and there was a sense of fullness and completeness. The accompaniment of the duet "Tibetan Compatriots Singing for the Liberation Army" briskly accompanied the progress of the singing, showing the beauty of Tibetan music. The instrumental music, songs, and narrative singing accompaniment of many other song and dance programs have played a considerable role. From the effect obtained by this competition, in addition to focusing on song creation, we must also find ways to help the development of instrumental music creation. The relationship between music and dance is so close that it cannot be separated. At present, the dance movement has rapidly unfolded in the troops, and in fact, music is needed to combine with this movement. Without good dance music, it is difficult to do dance well. In order to dance, the soldiers themselves buy erhus and harmonicas and other musical instruments, and use songs and folk songs for instrumental accompaniment. After learning a few dances, they compose their own dances and set them to music. Instrumental music is not only needed for dance, but also welcomed by cadres and soldiers as a separate program for performance. For example, when the Southwest Troops Art Troupe adapted Yangko dance music and songs into instrumental ensemble music for separate performance, the cadres and soldiers welcomed it. Sometimes, due to the generalization of the accompaniment, the soldiers were not satisfied after listening to it and suggested: "This song is the same as that song, it is not new." It can be seen that the soldiers have their own certain requirements for instrumental music. At present, our dance music creation has not kept up with the needs of the troops, and in the future, we must step up learning from life and folk music, and refer to the experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to gradually improve the level of dance music.

From this competition, it can also be seen that Chinese musical instruments have been able to express the healthy and optimistic emotions of the troops. I believe that our troops' music workers can fully exert the possibilities of Chinese musical instruments and more powerfully express combat life and the spirit of revolutionary heroism. We will not forget the power of Chinese musical instruments accompanying the performance of Comrade Xinghai's "Yellow River Cantata" in Yan'an! If we study, sort out, and use the musical instruments of all ethnic groups in China properly, it is entirely possible to exert greater power. As for foreign musical instruments, they can also be used. Although some foreign musical instruments are different from Chinese musical instruments in timbre, if the performers have a rich life of struggle, the feelings of the people, and understand the expression methods of national musical instruments, after careful research, it is possible to make foreign musical instruments express the feelings and national style of the Chinese people. These different timbres will also coordinate with Chinese musical instruments due to proper control, making the orchestra's color fresh.

This music competition is a great victory for the music work of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers. Through the performance of specific works, it proves that it has revolutionary ideological feelings, rich life, and distinct national colors in creation, singing, and performance, especially in the development of national musical language, it has taken a big step forward compared to the past few years. However, measured by the development of the cause of the People's Liberation Army and the requirements for building a modern national defense force, we cannot be satisfied with today's achievements. We should vigorously organize music workers to delve into the companies on the existing basis and create more and more excellent works that can be combined with the tasks of each military region, especially the combat and mass marching songs should be placed in the main position. At the same time, it is also necessary to train a large number of new song creation talents, expand the creation team, enhance the creation power, and further train soldier writers. Soldiers can write very good narrative singing, and they can also write very good lyrics, and can create melodies with firm will, bold feelings, and distinct national colors. In order to better implement the policy of "comprehensively developing the combat effectiveness and mass character of the People's Liberation Army's cultural and artistic work," we must also boldly launch discussions, criticisms, and self-criticisms of music creation and performance, and help music workers in the troops to continuously improve ideologically and technically and serve the soldiers wholeheartedly.

The new achievements in the music work of the People's Liberation Army are exciting. They add glory to Chinese national music and art. They encourage music workers across the country to move forward to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. I hope comrades will make greater efforts and create more excellent works rich in ideality and artistry in actual life.

    部队音乐工作的新成就
    何士德
    中国人民解放军“八一”建军节体育运动大会文艺比赛会的成功，对今后的文艺工作的开展有着重大的意义。它不但对全军文艺工作会产生巨大的影响，推动部队文艺工作者更进一步地开展连队文艺活动，创作更多的反映英雄部队的战斗生活的优秀作品；同时，它会像巨浪一样有力地推动部队以外的文艺工作者深入群众生活，认真地改造自己，切实地为人民服务。
    从音乐方面来说，经过五天的竞演，每天的情绪都那么饱满、愉快，人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的活生生的形象，英雄的事迹和快乐的生活，都一一展现在我们的眼前，特别是战士自编自唱的优秀节目，使我们兴奋、感动，并引为骄傲、光荣。
    比赛会告诉了我们：部队音乐工作者在上级领导下，贯彻了毛主席文艺路线，继承了人民军队的音乐传统，并执行了“面向连队，为兵服务”，“全面发展人民解放军战斗性、群众性文化艺术工作”的方针，获得了新的成就。
    部队的群众性的队列歌曲已在思想内容上、情感深度上，生活体现上和民族风格上都比以前有了进步。比如中南军区的“我是一个兵”概括地表现了人民解放军革命英雄主义的品质。表现了我们的战士是经过战争考验，立场坚定，以自己的岗位自豪，充满乐观情绪与胜利信念，有高度警惕性的祖国保护者和世界和平保卫者。词与曲结合得很紧，曲调流畅，节奏明朗，音乐语言是从民间音乐提高了的，既有革命的英雄气概又有民族气派，战士们很喜爱它，很快地就流传开来。中南军区的“我爱我的祖国”表达了国防军战士热爱伟大的祖国，热爱毛主席、共产党的内在情感，他们看到祖国今日的建设，看到祖国更美好的将来，坚决地保卫我们的祖国。曲调充满热情，有感人的力量，战士听了能理解能接受，并能引起内心的共鸣。可惜歌词不能令人十分满意，比较概念化。华东军区的“刺刀歌”唱出了人民战士爱护武器的心情，把武器看作自己的亲密战友，爱护它，磨利它，时刻准备发挥它的效能。词与曲的情绪是统一的，曲调运用了并且提高了民间的音乐语言，既有民族风格又有部队特点，唱起来有劲，易于上口，是一支革命乐观主义的歌子。
    说唱音乐在部队里有了新的发展和成就，它是在实际斗争生活中成长起来的。丰富的生活内容和热爱祖国热爱英雄的情感突破了旧形式的束缚，成为新鲜活泼、生气蓬勃和感染力很强的人人喜欢的新的说唱音乐。比如志愿军战士刘鹏同志的山东快书
    “侦察英雄韩起发”是一首充满了光辉的歌颂英雄的诗篇。它突出地表现了人物的性格，英雄的形象。思想明确、情节逼真、语言生动，听众好像亲眼看见韩起发怎样英勇机智地抓美国侵略军的军官。中南军区王凤鸣同志的“蓄洪区说话”，作者（原是战士，现在歌舞队工作）今年到荆江分洪区现场工作，以高度的爱国热情，通过蓄洪区的自述，生动地描绘祖国这个伟大建设工程的规模和它的意义，人民解放军和工农群众一块儿劳动，战胜了任何困难，表现了建设祖国的伟大力量和高度爱国主义精神。
    以上不过是在许多优秀的作品中举几个例子，说明部队音乐工作者能有这许多收获，一方面是由于党的培养教育，另方面是由于深入连队生活改造自己，体会战士的思想感情、崇高的品质，运用和创造民族音乐语言，说出战士心里的话的缘故。同时也说明了我们人民的部队，有着光荣的音乐传统，有着无限的创作力量。战士的创作能力很强，所创作的作品充沛着新的情感、新的语言和新的生命。音乐工作者应该虚心地向这些作品学习，向这些作者学习，学习他们对部队生活的认识、态度和观察方法，学习他们的写作经验，学习他们从民间提高了的、集体主义的、战斗生活丰富了的语言，这样，会大大地帮助我们正确地反映部队生活，正确地描写英雄人物的内心活动和形象。
    通过这次音乐比赛，我们可以看出在歌唱方面有几个特点：第一情绪饱满，第二咬字清楚，第三有民族气派。这比进城后任何一次大音乐会都有进步。例如王凤鸣同志，原是个农民，曾进过工厂工作，小时爱听说书及戏曲音乐。参加革命部队之后，战斗生活锻炼了他，党和上级耐心培养了他，再加上他不断地用功学习，他渐渐做到了随口能编顺口能唱。比赛会上，他演唱自编的“蓄洪区说话”及“卢湘云打兵舰”时，情绪饱满、发音正确、声音嘹亮、民族的语言，每个字都听得清楚，能拨动听众的心弦。孟贵彬同志，原不生长于藏族，可是他唱出了藏族同胞热爱人民解放军的真实情感。由于他到西南工作后，和藏胞相处如亲人一样，他接受了藏胞诚挚的情感的薰陶，体会了藏胞唱歌时是“情感与歌声融为一体”。经过反复地向藏胞学习，藏胞的歌声也就变成自己的歌声了。还有曹家定、邢素芬、向阳、周大信、冯克难和崔永昌等同志的演唱，基本上都能表达歌曲的内容。并且表现了色彩多样各有特点的民族风格，听众感到亲切可爱，感到这是自己民族的歌唱艺术。因此，我就想到一部分学过西洋发声法的同志，他们唱中国歌曲的时候，为什么听众感到不亲切不可爱，感到不是自己民族的歌唱艺术呢？根本的问题就在于这些同志不懂得或不努力从政治上思想上深刻地理解群众生活，不接受劳动人民情感的薰陶，不虚心继承民族歌唱艺术的优良传统，而片面的在形式上技巧上特殊趣味上兜圈子。崔永昌同志唱“三套黄牛一套马”时，能教我们领会到翻身后的农民积极生产的愉快情绪，勤劳的农民和农村景色好像就在我们眼前出现。但我们从上海唱片里听到另一位同志唱同样一个歌时，立刻就会晓得唱者缺乏农村生活的体验，缺乏对翻身农民的了解。虽然声音宏亮，音阶准确，强弱合宜，但唱不出农村的生活，唱不出翻身农民的情感，也就不能达到正确地演唱这作品的目的。大家都知道苏联许多出色的歌唱家，歌剧演员，他们的歌唱艺术已是在全世界范围内最高的水平，可是我们不要忘记，他们是苏联的歌唱艺术的优良传统的继承者，他们与群众保持着经常的密切的联系。这个事实，明白地告诉了我们：提高了的声乐艺术，必须具有人民的感情、民族的特点和风格。因此，要想解决部队歌唱艺术的提高问题，主要还是在这次比赛会正确的歌唱艺术的基础上，更进一步的了解生活、联系群众，向劳动人民最优秀的歌手，最优秀的戏曲艺人作批判的学习；其次批判的吸收外国特别是苏联先进的歌唱艺术的经验，以发挥祖国歌唱艺术最大的可能性。争论了许久的真嗓子假嗓子或真声假声的问题，在这次比赛会上听了许多唱歌之后，对这个问题应该有个明确的认识了。中国民间唱歌原来真声假声都使用，现在何必一定要用真声而不用假声呢？另一方面又何必硬说假声是科学的而真声不是科学的呢？声音是表达思想感情的工具，需要用什么声音就用什么声音，只要它能正确地充分地表达歌曲的真实的思想感情、现实生活、语言特点和民族风格，为广大群众所喜爱，公认为自己民族的歌唱艺术时，那就是科学的，民族的。因此，知识分子出身的歌唱艺术工作者，首先要解决的根本问题就是思想、情感和立场问题。这问题解决了，其余问题也就会跟着获得正确的解决。毛主席说：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的”。“我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把屁股移过来，一定要在深入工农兵、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马列主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺。”（毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话）。如果我们能坚决地执行毛主席的指示，深入群众斗争生活中去改造自己，坚决地站到工农兵方面，经常不断地与群众密切联系，并虚心地向我国传统的歌唱艺术学习，把群众与自己的智慧结合起来，则我们的歌唱艺术一定会获得群众欢迎，一定会有远大前途的。
    关于集体演唱方面也有了新的创造，华北军区演唱“英雄的汽车司机员”是个很好的例子。新鲜活泼的表演与歌曲内容相吻合，汽车司机员在朝鲜前线英勇机智地战胜敌机轰炸的形象被刻划出来了。许多人认为这种演唱形式值得推广，因为各式各样的演唱可以大大的活跃部队生活。但在创作演唱时要加以注意的，就是不要过份追求演唱形式而忽略了歌曲创作的质量，不要光从演唱形式方面来博取战士的喜欢，以免流于形式主义。我认为最主要的是把歌子写好，表演动作须适当地与歌曲内容及形式相结合，否则会使听众对歌曲的内容感到模糊，减弱了音乐的力量或发生不统一之感。比如“一粒子弹一包糖”的表演形式是不够恰当的，在舞台上穿着志愿军制服，左看看右看看地看见小孩受敌机轰炸扫射的时候光在着急，观众马上会感到，为什么不奔过去抢救呢？观众认为这不是直接表达英雄人物的形象，是带有旁观态度的演唱形式。
    器乐曲的创作和乐器的使用，在部队已经有了一定的经验。我们听了“筑路舞”的音乐，感到健康有劲，帮助了舞的情绪的发挥。听了“军民打青稞”的音乐，觉得亲切、愉快、民族色彩鲜明。听到“轮机兵舞”的音乐，感到悦耳流畅，帮助观众对舞发生好感。独唱曲“歌唱二郎山”演唱时，伴奏与歌声和谐，民族风格统一，有丰满完整之感。二重唱
    “藏胞歌唱解放军”的伴奏明快地陪衬着歌声的进行，显出藏族音乐的美丽。其他许多歌舞节目的器乐曲、歌曲和说唱的伴奏都起了相当的作用。由这次比赛所获得的效果来看，我们除以歌曲创作为主之外，也要设法帮助器乐曲创作的发展。音乐与舞蹈的关系是密切到不能分离的，目前舞蹈运动在部队里已迅速展开，实际上需要音乐来结合这个运动，如果没有好的舞蹈音乐，想把舞蹈搞好是困难的。战士为着要跳舞，自己买二胡买口琴等乐器，将歌曲及民歌用到器乐上伴奏。学会了几个舞之后自己就进行编舞配乐。器乐曲不但为舞蹈所需要，就是作为单独节目来演出，也为干部和战士所欢迎。例如西南部队文工团将秧歌舞曲及歌曲编成器乐合奏曲单独演奏时，干部和战士都欢迎，有时因配乐上的一般化，战士听了不满足，提出意见说：
    “这歌与那歌一样，不新。”可知战士对器乐曲有他们一定的要求的。目前，我们的舞曲的创作，还没赶上部队的需要，今后还须加紧向生活向民间音乐学习，并参考苏联及各人民民主国家的经验，逐步提高舞曲的水平。
    从这次比赛中，也可以看出中国乐器已能够表现部队健康乐观的情绪，我认为我们部队的音乐工作者能够充分地发挥中国乐器的可能性，更有力地表现战斗生活和革命英雄主义的精神。我们不会忘记，星海同志的“黄河大合唱”在延安演出时中国乐器伴奏所发挥的威力吧！如果我们把中国各民族的乐器加以研究整理、使用得适当，就完全有可能发挥更大的力量。至于外国乐器呢，也可以使用，虽然有些外国乐器在音色上与中国乐器不相同，但演奏者如果有丰富的斗争生活，人民的情感，并且了解民族乐器的表现方法的话，再经细心研究，是可以使外国乐器表现中国人民情感和民族风格的。这些不同的音色也会因控制得宜，会与中国乐器协调起来，使乐队色彩新鲜。
    这次音乐比赛，是人民解放军和志愿军音乐工作一个大胜利，通过具体的作品的演出，证明了无论在创作上、演唱上、演奏上都具备了革命的思想情感，丰富的生活和鲜明的民族色彩，特别在民族音乐语言的发展上比过去几年向前踏进了一大步。但从人民解放军事业的发展、建设现代化国防军的要求来衡量，我们还不能满足于今日的成就，应当在现有的基础上大力的组织音乐工作者深入连队，创作更多更多的能结合各军区任务的优秀作品，尤其应当把具有战斗性群众性的队列歌曲放在主要的地位。同时，还须培养大批新的歌曲创作人材，扩大创作的队伍，增强创作的力量，更要进一步地培养战士作家。战士既能编出很好的说唱，同样也能编出很好的歌词，并能创作意志坚定、感情豪放和民族色彩鲜明的曲调来。为着更好地贯彻“全面发展人民解放军战斗性、群众性的文化艺术工作”方针，还要大胆地展开音乐创作和演出的讨论、批评与自我批评的工作，帮助部队音乐工作者从思想上、技术上不断地提高，全心全意地为兵服务。
    人民解放军音乐工作的新成就是令人兴奋的，它为中国民族音乐艺术增添了光彩，它鼓舞着全国音乐工作者为贯彻毛主席文艺路线向前迈进，希望同志们加倍努力，在实际生活中创作更多的富于思想性艺术性的优秀作品。
