Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd: On September 17th, the US judicial authorities, again under the pretext of violating the fascist Smith Act, arrested eighteen leading cadres of the Communist Party USA, including Helen Winter and Paul Bowen, in Michigan, Missouri, Illinois, California, Oregon, Washington, and Minnesota. The National Committee of the Communist Party USA issued a special statement on this matter, emphasizing that the arrest of communists is part of the war policy of Wall Street monopoly capitalists, who need the Korean War and see it as a means to stimulate the production of armaments, from which they can obtain huge profits. After the election, the danger of war will become even more serious, and the warmongers expect to be able to do whatever they want at that time.

The statement pointed out that the courts are trying communists "relying on bribed prosecutors, reactionary judges, perjurers, prejudiced and intimidated jurors." Such trials blatantly trample on the Bill of Rights and show contempt for democracy and justice.

The National Committee of the Communist Party USA called on the American people to rise up and defend the communists who have been prosecuted and imprisoned, pointing out that these communists are being persecuted for defending the vital interests of the American people, that is, for safeguarding living standards, guaranteeing democratic freedoms, and defending world peace. The statement concluded by emphasizing that demanding the release of communists, fighting for the rights of black people, fighting for the abolition of the Smith Act and the McCarran Act, fighting for peace, and fighting to support the election campaigns of Progressive Party candidates: this is the main task of the American people today.

The statement of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA was signed by Foster, Flynn, and Perry.

    美国政府非法逮捕密执安州等地十八个美共领袖
    美共号召美国人民保卫切身利益反对迫害
    【新华社二十三日讯】纽约消息：九月十七日，美国司法当局又以违犯法西斯的史密斯法为名，在密执安州、密苏里州、伊利诺斯州、加利福尼亚州、俄勒冈州、华盛顿州和明尼苏达州等地逮捕了美国共产党领导干部海伦·温特尔、保罗·鲍温等十八人。美国共产党全国委员会特地就这件事发表声明，强调指出：逮捕共产党员是华尔街垄断资本家战争政策的一部分，他们需要朝鲜战争，认为这是刺激可以获得巨额利润的军火生产的手段。在大选后，战争危险就会更加严重，战争贩子们都指望在那时更能畅所欲为。
    声明指出：法院是“依靠受贿的检察官、反动的法官、作伪证的人们、有成见和受到了恐吓的陪审官”来审判共产党员的。这种审判明目张胆地蹂躏了权利法案，蔑视了民主和司法。
    美国共产党全国委员会号召美国人民起来保卫已经被起诉和被关在牢里的共产党员，指出这些共产党员是因为保卫美国人民的切身利益，也就是因为维护生活水平，保障民主自由和保卫世界和平而受迫害的。声明最后着重指出：要求释放共产党员，为争取黑人的权利、为废除史密斯法和麦卡伦法而斗争，为和平而斗争，为支持进步党候选人的竞选而斗争：这就是美国人民当前的主要任务。
    美国共产党全国委员会的声明由福斯特、佛林和培理签字。
