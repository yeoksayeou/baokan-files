    Drafting Patriotic Health Pacts
  　By Su Guang
    With the deepening of the nationwide patriotic health campaign, a completely new atmosphere has emerged everywhere. The No. 1, Yi Alley, Bicai Hutong, Beijing, is one of thousands of examples of this new look. Since 1950, the 46 households in this courtyard, under the leadership of the model hygiene team leader, Aunt Song, have consistently maintained cleanliness and hygiene in their diet, furniture, personal hygiene, and both inside and outside their homes. This summer, Aunt Song again took the lead, connecting with the masses, influencing and promoting the participation of nearby residents in the patriotic health campaign. Everyone has signed patriotic health pacts, determined to push the patriotic health campaign further forward.
