    X.	When applying fertilizer, Wang Shugui abandoned the lazy method of applying fertilizer only once in the past and adopted a new method of applying fertilizer in stages. During the first plowing, he applied a mixed fertilizer of cow dung, pig manure, and plant ash per mu; during the second spring plowing, he applied another ten loads of moss green leaf fertilizer per mu.
    XI.	During the second grass treading, he applied another thirty-six catties of bone meal per mu. In this way, there was fertilizer in every layer of the field. But his father came to interfere with him again, saying, "A fertile field yields a lot of grass, and lake fields (fields near the lake) should not be over-fertilized." But Wang Shugui knew what he was doing: he had chosen the fertilizer-resistant fine variety "Victory Xian."
    XII.	When transplanting seedlings, the farm comrades taught Wang Shugui to plant three or four seedlings per clump, because the field was fertile, and if there were too many seedlings, they would only grow stalks and not ears. But his father used the old method of "eight seedlings per clump" to argue with him, saying, "If you don't listen to the old people, you will suffer losses." Wang Shugui ignored his father and said to his younger brothers, "If you don't listen to Chairman Mao, then you will really suffer!"

    十、下肥时，王树桂不用过去施一次肥的懒办法，采取分期下肥的新办法。第一次耕田时，每亩下了牛粪、猪粪和草木灰的混合肥；第二次春耕时，每亩又下了十担苔子绿叶肥。
    十一、第二次踩草时，每亩又上了三十六斤骨粉。这样地里层层有肥了。可是父亲又来干涉他了，说：“田肥一把草，湖田（靠近湖的田）不能多下肥。”但王树桂心里有数：他选的是耐肥良种“胜利籼”。
    十二、插秧时，农场同志教王树桂每兜插三、四根秧，因为田肥，秧多了，就会光长稻秆不长穗。但他父亲又拿“兜兜八根秧”的老办法来和他争论，说：“不听老人言，吃亏在眼前。”王树桂不理他父亲，对弟弟们说：“不听毛主席言，那才吃亏在眼前！”
