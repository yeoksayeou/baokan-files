    Preparations for the Establishment of the Northeast Electric Meter Instrument Factory
    -- An Example of How Soviet Experts Emphasized Surveying and Investigation
    Chen Ji
    What kind of surveying and investigation work should be done before designing a factory? How should we treat surveying and investigation work? These are problems that many capital construction departments have not solved. The following introduces how two Soviet experts helped us design the electric meter instrument factory, which can help us find the key to solving this problem.
    In mid-February of this year, Soviet experts Shakhov and Burkovsky came to Northeast China to assist the Electric Engineering Bureau of the Northeast Industrial Department with preparatory work before designing the electric meter instrument factory. They spent five months diligently collecting design data and meticulously conducting surveying and investigation work.
    When selecting the factory site, some comrades in the Electric Engineering Bureau initially advocated setting up the factory in a small city, because there was ample space and some existing buildings. After investigating the surrounding environment of the city, the Soviet experts definitively pointed out that it was not suitable for building such a complex and advanced factory, believing that the basis for selecting the site should not be merely "ample space and some existing buildings." The Soviet experts cited four possibilities as the basis for selecting the site:
    1. The possibility of greatly replenishing high-quality technical personnel and workers;
    2. The possibility of easily obtaining various raw materials and semi-finished products from other factories;
    3. The possibility of cooperating with research institutes, universities, libraries, and other factories to solve technical problems;
    4. The possibility of easily learning and disseminating advanced production methods and carrying out mass production activities.
    The city originally selected by the Electric Engineering Bureau was a remote and small place with inconvenient transportation, and it did not have or lacked these possibilities. Building a factory there would also greatly increase the investment in water, electricity, and transportation. Therefore, they accepted the Soviet experts' suggestion and decided to select the factory site in another city.
    After the site was selected, the Soviet experts tirelessly searched for a suitable area, requiring the area not only to have existing transportation facilities and convenient water and electricity supply, but also to have available hospitals, entertainment venues, fire-fighting equipment, etc. Because building a factory in such an area can greatly reduce the investment in auxiliary equipment, the investment can be used as much as possible for the main project. They opposed the phenomenon in the capital construction department of increasing the investment in auxiliary equipment at all costs, believing that this was an irresponsible act towards the state and a waste of state funds.
    After the factory site was selected, the Soviet experts spent most of their time collecting original design data.
    In the work of collecting original design data, Soviet experts attached particular importance to geological data. Geological data is an indispensable basis for civil engineering design. Although this factory is not a heavy machinery factory, the Soviet experts did not relax the collection of geological data at all. They requested that excavations be carried out at the most important locations on the factory site, taking out undisturbed soil samples every meter for chemical analysis and pressure resistance tests; soil samples should also be taken at secondary locations to make soil sample records. Not only should scientific conclusions be drawn on the upper soil, but also the soil layer below ten feet should be explained as the basis for underground construction. A total of ten wells were dug on the factory site, with depths ranging from ten meters to twenty meters. After investigating the geological data, a geological report must be made to explain the reasons why the area can or cannot be built from a geological point of view. In order to draw a positive conclusion from the geological aspect, the geological report was rewritten five times under the guidance of Soviet experts before it was finalized.
    Soviet experts also attached great importance to the investigation of water and electricity data. When investigating electricity data, Soviet experts went to the local electricity bureau six times, inquired in detail about various technical conditions, and required the electricity bureau to ensure that there would be no problems with power supply during the construction and production of the factory, and also required that there be two power supply systems to avoid the possibility of power outages. In the process of investigating water data, Soviet experts studied the situation of the entire urban water supply system, and personally went to the water plant twenty times, requiring the water company to not only ensure an uninterrupted supply of daily water, but also to ensure that 55 cubic meters of water per hour could be supplied in the event of a fire. In order to ensure the potability of the water, physical tests and bacterial analysis of the water were also carried out. Some engineers believe: "I am doing design, how can I consider so many water and electricity problems!" However, Soviet experts believe that this is the inherent responsibility of engineers, and they not only pay attention to these problems, but also carefully investigate natural data such as wind direction, wind speed, temperature, underground freezing, snow accumulation, and rainfall.
    When collecting data, Soviet experts not only considered the design, but also considered the construction and production; not only considered their own factory, but also considered the construction of the city. They learned about the origin, price, transportation conditions and supply of building materials (bricks, tiles, sand, stone, lime, cement, wood, etc.) from all aspects, and learned about the analysis data of coal from the coal mine bureau. Soviet experts said: If you don't understand these, what will happen if difficulties arise in the future! Among the projects of Soviet experts collecting design data, there is also an item for investigating the situation of municipal construction. They personally went to the local people's government to inquire about the requirements of the surrounding area of the factory for the construction of the factory, the requirements for flood prevention, and the requirements for hygiene, and inquired whether the location of the factory site would hinder the city's traffic, and whether the height of the factory building would affect the city's appearance. Such a global perspective is what we should learn very well.
    Soviet experts often went to the site in person to collect design data. Once, a Soviet expert was ill, but he still walked to the site for investigation. They believed that any data collected must have a scientific basis and written proof. When one of our comrades learned about the basis for the sea level elevation, he learned about it from a factory. When the Soviet expert discovered it, he immediately pointed out: "This basis is unscientific. Because the sea level elevation of this factory is wrong, we will also be wrong. We should look for a formal basis." When some comrades learned about the data, they made phone calls or asked verbally without obtaining formal written proof. Soviet experts believe that this approach is not acceptable. In the design data collected by Soviet experts, there are formal documents from government agencies. Soviet experts told us: Without affirmative proof, it cannot be used as a formal basis for design.
    This is how Soviet experts value surveying and investigation work. The reason why the design of many of our factories goes wrong is because we have not collected design data as carefully as Soviet experts and conducted thorough investigation and research. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is the main link in improving our design work.

    东北电表仪器厂建厂前的准备工作
    ——苏联专家如何重视勘察与调查的一个实例
    陈　迹
    在设计一个工厂之前，应该做那些勘察调查工作呢？应该怎样对待勘察调查工作呢？这是很多基本建设部门没有解决的问题。以下介绍两位苏联专家帮助我们设计电表仪器厂时怎样做勘察调查工作的情况，它可以帮助我们找着解决这个问题的钥匙。
    今年二月中旬，苏联专家沙赫夫和布尔阔夫斯基两位同志来到东北，帮助东北工业部电工局电表仪器工厂在设计前进行准备工作。他们花费了五个月的时间，认真地搜集设计资料，周密地进行勘察调查工作。
    在选择这个工厂厂址的时候，电工局某些同志最初主张把这个工厂设在一个小城市中，因为那儿有宽裕的地方，有几幢现成的房屋。苏联专家调查了该城周围环境，肯定地指出在那儿不适于建设这样一个复杂的先进的工厂，认为选择厂址的根据不能仅仅是“有宽裕的地方和几幢现成的房屋”。苏联专家举出应根据四个可能，作为选择厂址的根据。
    一、大量地补充质量较好的技术人员和工人的可能；
    二、易于获得多种原料和其他工厂的半成品的可能；
    三、和研究所、大学、图书馆以及其他工厂合作解决技术问题的可能；
    四、易于学习和传播先进生产方法和开展群众性的生产活动的可能。
    电工局原来选择的那个城是个荒僻的小地方，交通不便，根本不具备或不够具备这些可能性。在那儿建厂，对于水、电、交通的投资也要极大地增加。因而，他们接受了苏联专家的建议，决定把这个工厂厂址选在另一个城里。
    厂址选定后，苏联专家不知疲倦地到处寻找一块适当的地区，要求这块地区不仅要有现成的交通设备，便利的水、电供应，而且还要有可以利用的医院、娱乐场所、消防设备等。因为在这样的地区建厂，就可以大大地缩小附属设备的投资，就可以把投资尽量地用到主要工程上去。他们反对在基本建设部门中，不惜花费地增大附属设备投资的现象，认为这是对国家不负责任的表现，是浪费国家资金的行为。
    选定了这个工厂的厂址，苏联专家又用了极大部分的时间，来搜集原始的设计资料。
    在搜集原始的设计资料的工作中，苏联专家特别重视地质资料。地质资料是土木建筑设计的决不可少的依据。虽然这个工厂不是重型机器工厂，但苏联专家也毫不放松地质资料的搜集。他们要求在厂地最重要的地点，进行挖掘，每隔一米取出原样土，来作化学的分析和耐压力的试验；在次要的地点，也要取出土样，作出土样纪录。不但要对上层的土作出科学的结论，而且要对十尺以下的土层，加以说明，以作为地下建筑的根据。在这个厂地共挖了十个井，其深度从十米到二十米不等。调查了地质资料，必须做出地质报告书，从地质观点来说明这个地区能否建厂的理由。为了从地质方面做出肯定的结论，在苏联专家指导下，地质报告书改写了五次，才最后定稿。
    苏联专家对于上、下水资料、电力资料的调查也非常重视。在调查电力资料时，苏联专家到该地电业局去了六次，详细地询问了各种技术条件，要求电业局保证在这个工厂修建时和生产时供电都不发生问题，而且要求能够有两条供电系统，以避免供电时发生中断的可能。在调查上、下水资料的过程中，苏联专家研究了整个市区的自来水系统的情况，亲自到自来水厂二十次，要求自来水公司不仅保证不间断地供应平时用水，而且保证在发生火警时，可以供应每小时五十五立方米的水量。为了确保水的可饮用，还做了水的物理的试验和细菌的分析。有些工程师认为：“我是做设计的，那能考虑那么多的水呀电呀的问题哩！”然而，苏联专家却认为这是工程师的天经地义的职责，而且他们不仅注意这些问题，还详细地调查了风向、风速、温度、地下冻结、积雪、降雨量等天然资料。
    苏联专家搜集资料时，不仅考虑到设计，还考虑到施工和生产；不仅考虑到自己的工厂，还考虑到市政的建设。他们从各方面了解建筑材料（砖瓦、砂、石、灰、水泥、木材等）的产地、价格、运输条件和供应情况，从煤矿局了解煤的分析的资料。苏联专家说：不了解这些，将来发生困难怎么办！在苏联专家搜集设计资料的项目中，也有市政建设情况调查的一项。他们亲自到当地人民政府，询问工厂周围地区对这个工厂建筑的要求，防水的要求、卫生的要求，询问厂址的位置是否妨碍市的交通，厂房的高低是否有碍市容。像这样的全局观点，更是我们应该很好学习的。
    苏联专家为了搜集设计资料，经常亲自到现场去。有一次，一位苏联专家病了，但他仍然步行去现场调查。搜集任何一件资料，他们认为都必须有科学的根据，文字的证明。我们有个同志了解拔海标高的根据时，是向某工厂了解的。苏联专家发现了，立刻指出：“这个根据是不科学的。因为这个工厂的拔海标搞错了，我们也要跟着错。我们应该找正式的根据。”某些同志了解资料时，打打电话，或者口头问问，没有取得正式文件的证明。苏联专家认为这样的做法，是不行的。在苏联专家搜集的设计资料中，都有政府机关的正式文件。苏联专家告诉我们：没有肯定的证明，是不能作为设计时正式的根据的。
    苏联专家就是这样地重视勘察调查工作的。我们很多工厂的设计所以出毛病，就是由于我们没有像苏联专家这样认真地搜集设计资料，周密地调查研究。好好地学习苏联的先进经验，是改进我们设计工作的主要环节。
