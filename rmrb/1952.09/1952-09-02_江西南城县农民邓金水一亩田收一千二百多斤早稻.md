    Jiangxi Nancheng County Farmer Deng Jinshui Harvests Over 1,200 Jin of Early Rice Per Mu

    To the Editors: Deng Jinshui, a farmer from Hualou Village, Miaoqian Township, Nancheng County, Jiangxi Province, harvested 2,288 jin of net dry rice from his 1.84 mu double-cropping rice experimental high-yield field, equivalent to 1,243 jin per mu, a 73 percent increase compared to last year.

    Deng Jinshui was originally a hired farmhand and was allocated farmland and housing during the land reform. This year, he joined a mutual aid team, which solved his difficulties in lacking means of production. When he fell ill for four days during the fourth weeding of the early rice, the mutual aid team helped him finish the weeding. The mutual aid team established a mutual inspection system, and the members often supervised and encouraged each other, which stimulated his enthusiasm and confidence for high yields. He began to overcome his conservative ideas of sticking to old ways in production and improved his farming techniques. He responded to the challenge from Yu Xingfa, a county model worker, and humbly learned from Yu Xingfa's high-yield experience. He practiced intensive cultivation and careful management, rational irrigation, and paid attention to pest control, seed selection, and fertilization. He believes that "preventing pests is better than catching pests." As early as last November, he cleared the weeds along the edges of the fields, eliminating pests lurking in the weeds. He understands the principle that "a good daughter depends on her mother, good seedlings depend on the seedlings, and good seedlings depend on good seeds," so he is very particular about seed selection. The seeds he used were selected by panicle selection in the field last year, and wind and water selection were also carried out. Therefore, the seed purity was above 98 percent. He knows that "a child cannot grow without milk, and seedlings cannot grow without fertilizer," so he applied 130 dan of fertilizer to his high-yield field. Because the fertilizer was properly matched, it prevented the phenomenon of excessive fertilizer causing the rice seedlings to lodge.

    江西南城县农民邓金水一亩田收一千二百多斤早稻
    编辑同志：江西南城县庙前乡花楼村农民邓金水种的一亩八分四厘双季稻丰产试验田，收获了二千二百八十八斤净干稻谷，每亩合一千二百四十三斤，比去年增产百分之七十三。
    邓金水原是雇农，在土地改革时分得了耕地和房屋。今年他参加了互助组，解决了缺乏生产资料的困难。他在早稻耘第四道时病了四天，互助组就帮他耘完了。互助组内建立了互相检查的制度，组员们经常互相督促、鼓励，这都激发了他的丰产热情和信心。他在生产上开始克服墨守成规的保守思想，提高了耕作技术。他向县劳动模范余兴发应战，虚心学习余兴发的丰产经验。他实行精耕细作，合理灌溉，并且注意防虫、选种和施肥。他认为“捉虫不如防虫”，早在去年十一月间，就将地边的杂草铲尽，消灭了潜伏在杂草里的害虫。他懂得“好女看娘，好禾看秧，好秧靠好种”的道理，因此很讲究选种。他用的种籽在去年经过田间穗选，又实行了风选水选，因此，种籽纯度在百分之九十八以上。他知道“小孩无奶不得大，禾苗无肥不会长”，在自己的丰产田里上了一百三十担肥料。由于肥料配合得当，所以防止了肥料过多禾苗倒伏的现象。
