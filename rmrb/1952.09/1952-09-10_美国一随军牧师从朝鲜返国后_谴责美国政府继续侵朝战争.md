Xinhua News Agency, Prague: According to the New York "Daily Worker" of August 25th, Baker, a Presbyterian army chaplain who recently returned to the United States from the Korean battlefield, condemned the US ruling clique for continuing the Korean War while preaching in Redlands, California.

Baker spoke of the low morale of American soldiers in Korea. He said: The only hope for soldiers in Korea is to go home.

Baker recounted: A group of soldiers sat "very lonely" on the side of a mountain in Korea, reading a newspaper from a major American city. They searched page by page until they found page twenty-four, where they saw a total of nine lines of news about the Korean War. The news said: "The front is very quiet - only minor contact on the 15th." Baker compared this report with the actual situation and said: "On the 15th, people were desperately and continuously firing artillery, saying prayers over the shattered bodies of seven dead soldiers, helping with blood transfusions, and helping to evacuate eighteen wounded soldiers." Baker said: On this day, hundreds of war-weary soldiers asked: "Chaplain, what are we doing here?"

Baker rebuked the politicians of the two major American parties and the various ugly performances at their recent national conventions. Baker pointed out that these politicians are the root cause of the unnecessary deaths in Korea. He said: The petty people bearing major responsibilities are using Korea as their bet.

Baker also condemned the US authorities in his sermon for forcing him to sign a guarantee to remain silent about the true situation of the Korean War.

    美国一随军牧师从朝鲜返国后
    谴责美国政府继续侵朝战争
    【新华社布拉格电】据八月二十五日纽约“工人日报”消息：最近从朝鲜战场回到美国的长老会随军牧师贝克，在加利福尼亚州里德兰城讲道时，谴责美国统治集团继续进行朝鲜战争。
    贝克讲到在朝鲜的美国士兵士气的低落。他说：在朝鲜的士兵的唯一希望是回家。
    贝克叙述道：有一批士兵“非常孤寂地”坐在朝鲜的一座山边，阅读美国一家大城市的报纸，逐页找寻找到了第二十四页，才看到共九行字的关于朝鲜战争的新闻。这条新闻说：“前线甚为沉寂——十五日仅有小接触。”贝克把这个报道与实际情况作比较说：“在十五日，人们在拼命地不断发射排炮，在向着七名阵亡士兵的打烂了的尸体做祷告，在帮助输血，在帮助撤退十八名受伤的士兵。”贝克说：这一天几百名厌战的士兵提出询问道：“牧师，我们在这里究竟是干什么呢？”
    贝克斥责美国两大政党的政客和他们在最近两党的全国代表大会上的种种丑态。贝克指出：这些政客们就是造成在朝鲜的不必要的死亡的祸根。他说：担当重大责任的小人物们把朝鲜当作他们的赌注。
    贝克在讲道中并且谴责美国当局强迫他签字保证对朝鲜战争的真实情况保持缄默。
