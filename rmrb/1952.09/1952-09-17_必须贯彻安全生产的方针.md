The People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council today issued a "Circular on Handling Serious Injury and Death Accidents Caused by Certain State-Owned and Local State-Owned Factories and Mines Neglecting Safe Production." All factories, mines, and other enterprises in various regions should learn from the lessons pointed out in this circular and resolutely launch a struggle against bureaucratic and capitalist management ideologies and methods.

Over the past three years, factories, mines, and transportation enterprises in various regions have generally and actively improved the working conditions and welfare facilities of employees during the process of carrying out democratic reforms and production reforms. A labor insurance system has been implemented for more than 15 million employees (including family members), and many welfare services such as sanatoriums, convalescent homes, homes for the disabled, orphanages, and nurseries have been established. With the improvement of the national financial and economic situation, workers' wages have also been continuously increased, and state-owned enterprises have also stipulated measures to use enterprise bonus funds to initially improve the material and cultural lives of employees. The Central People's Government and state-owned enterprise departments are particularly concerned about the working conditions of workers. They have not only formulated and promulgated various regulations and rules to ensure safe production, improved safety and health equipment, but also conducted general safety inspections in factories and mines. By the end of 1951, factories and mines in the Northeast region had conducted three comprehensive inspections, solving more than 200,000 safety and health equipment problems. In 1951, the railway system spent more than 90 billion yuan on safety and health facilities. The ventilation equipment in coal mines has been greatly improved, and flood prevention work has also made great progress. Safety and health equipment in other enterprises has also been greatly improved, so the number of casualties in factories and mines across the country has been greatly reduced. For example, the casualty rate in state-owned coal mines in 1951 decreased by 63.6 percent compared with 1949; gas explosion casualties were basically eliminated in 1951. The Shi Yuhai team in the Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China even created a new record of no casualties for five years. Work-related injuries in the national railway system decreased by 44.6 percent in 1951 compared with 1950. In addition, textile workshops have improved ventilation and spray equipment, reducing the incidence of disease among workers. Worker poisoning has been basically eliminated in the chemical industry. Silicosis, a disease that could never be solved in the history of Hunan Antimony Mine, has now disappeared. These situations are sufficient to show that safety and health work has indeed made great achievements.

At present, the nationwide campaign for increased production and thrift is being actively carried out among employees of enterprises. Especially on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the vast number of employees have further exerted their high production enthusiasm, creating huge wealth for the country and laying the foundation for production reform. However, it is undeniable that many leading cadres of enterprises still have not paid enough attention to the guiding principle of safe production. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the consciousness of employees has been improved, and their selfless labor enthusiasm has been stimulated. The production tasks of various enterprises are heavy, and the production management of many units is obviously not keeping up with the objective needs; some units have simple equipment, which is difficult to overcome for a while; more importantly, some administrative leaders and trade union workers in enterprises have a simple task-oriented view and a one-sided economic view, only caring about completing production or financial tasks, disregarding national laws, and showing indifference to the lives and health of workers, so that serious casualties have still occurred in many enterprises recently. This is intolerable.

Some leading cadres and trade union workers in enterprises often put the completion of production tasks, the implementation of economic accounting, and the practice of thrift in opposition to safe production and the protection of the lives and health of employees. They do not understand or do not fully understand that workers are the creators of national wealth and are the most valuable property of our country. They do not understand the positive significance of "safety first," nor do they understand the unity of labor protection and increased production and thrift, so that they emphasize one aspect and ignore the other, and cannot correctly implement the guiding principle of safe production. Some serious bureaucrats completely disregard the lives and health of employees. They do not actively try to ensure the safe production conditions of employees, do not formulate or do not seriously implement security systems, and even use deceptive means to deceive workers into doing dangerous work. Some have formulated some rules and regulations, but they are just a formality. They do not conduct safety production education for workers, so that workers do not have safety knowledge, and thus violate operating procedures and labor discipline. After the accident, they also blame the workers. Some factory and mine leaders do not plan or are not good at planning work, sometimes being lax and other times being rushed. In order to catch up with tasks, they disregard safety and blindly mobilize workers to rush, work overtime, which is also a cause of accidents. As for only arranging or inspecting production tasks without simultaneously arranging or inspecting safety and health work, thereby encouraging the simple task-oriented views and trophyism of grassroots administrative leaders and trade union cadres, this is an even more common phenomenon. In terms of safety supervision organizations, general factories and mines are not very sound, some have not yet been established, and some have been established, but the leadership does not pay attention to them, and the cadres are not strong and are arbitrarily transferred, so no one is responsible for security work, and labor discipline is lax. Even worse, some factory and mine cadres completely attribute the cause of the accident to objective factors, attempting to shirk the responsibility that the leadership should bear. This is completely wrong.

Administrative leaders and trade union cadres at all levels of factories and mines must recognize the importance of safe production. Only when the leadership cares about the lives and health of employees can it further motivate the vast number of employees to increase production and practice thrift, and only by reducing or avoiding casualties can it conform to the general spirit of increasing production and thrift. Bureaucracy on the part of the leadership must be overcome, safety production education for workers must be strengthened, on the one hand, empiricism among old workers must be corrected and production discipline must be strengthened; on the other hand, they must be mobilized to supervise safe production.

In order to protect the safety and welfare of employees, in addition to implementing and enriching the relevant labor protection system, improving safety equipment, and strengthening protection work, factories and mines in various regions should also establish and improve the institutions for safety production supervision. Report and expose those who neglect safety production, and ensure the gradual improvement of safety and health equipment. At the same time, factories and mines in various regions should also give full play to the role of enterprise bonus funds, and include the necessary expenditures for safety and health equipment in the annual budget in the financial plan. At present, factories and mines in various regions should conduct a major safety and health inspection with emphasis and practically. In the future, when leading organs at all levels assess the performance of enterprises, they should not only check the extent to which they have completed their plans, but also include their work on the safety and welfare of employees as a standard for evaluation.

### 必须贯彻安全生产的方针

    必须贯彻安全生产的方针
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会今天发表了“关于处理某些国营、地方国营厂矿企业忽视安全生产致发生重大伤亡事故的通报”。各地工厂、矿山等企业单位都应该根据这个通报中所指出的教训，坚决向官僚主义和资本主义的经营思想与管理方法展开斗争。
    各地工厂、矿山及交通运输企业，三年来在进行民主改革和生产改革的过程中，对于职工的劳动条件福利设施一般地曾积极加以改进。在一千五百多万职工中（连家属在内）已经推行了劳动保险制度，还举办了许多疗养所、休养所、残废养老院、孤儿保育院、托儿所等福利事业。随着国家财政经济情况的好转，工人的工资也不断提高，国营企业部门又规定了动用企业奖励基金的办法，使职工的物质生活和文化生活有了初步的改善。中央人民政府及国营企业部门尤其关心工人的劳动条件，不但制定并颁布了保障安全生产的各种条例和规程，改进了安全卫生的设备，并且对工厂、矿山普遍地进行了安全大检查。东北区各厂矿至一九五一年底曾举行三次全面大检查，解决了安全卫生设备等方面的问题二十多万件。铁路系统在一九五一年用于安全卫生设施的经费达九百余亿元。煤矿通风设备有了很大改善，防水工作也有很大进步。其他企业的安全卫生设备也都有很大改进，因而全国各工厂、矿山的伤亡事故已大为减少了。例如国营煤矿一九五一年比一九四九年的伤亡率降低百分之六三点六；瓦斯爆炸伤亡事故，在一九五一年已基本消灭。东北西安煤矿施玉海小组更创造了五年未发生伤亡事故的新纪录。全国铁路系统的工伤，一九五一年比一九五零年降低了百分之四四点六。其余如纺织车间改进了通风喷雾设备，减低了工人的患病率。化学工业中基本消灭了工人中毒的现象。湖南锑矿在历史上永远也没能解决的矽肺病，现在也已经绝迹了。这些情况都足以说明安全卫生工作确实有了很大成绩。
    目前，全国各企业职工增产节约竞赛的运动正在积极开展，特别是在“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上，广大职工进一步发挥了高度的生产热情，给国家创造了巨额的财富，并奠定了生产改革的基础。但不可否认，有许多企业领导干部，对安全生产的方针仍然没有给以足够的重视。在“三反”“五反”运动以后，职工觉悟提高，激发了忘我的劳动热情，各企业的生产任务繁重，有许多单位的生产管理工作显然赶不上客观的需要；有的单位设备简陋，一时尚难克服；更重要的是某些企业的行政领导及工会工作者存在着单纯任务观点和片面的经济观点，只顾完成生产或财政的任务，不顾国家法令，对工人的生命与健康漠不关心，以致有许多企业单位近来仍然发生了严重的伤亡事故。这是不能容忍的。
    有些企业的领导干部和工会工作者，在思想上往往把完成生产任务、推行经济核算、厉行节约与安全生产、保护职工生命健康对立起来。他们不懂得或不完全懂得工人是国家财富的创造者，是我们国家的最宝贵的财产。他们不了解“安全第一”的积极意义，也不懂得劳动保护与增产节约的统一性，以致强调这一面就忽视另一面，不能正确地贯彻安全生产的方针。有些严重的官僚主义者，则根本漠视职工的生命与健康。他们不积极设法保障职工生产的安全条件，不制定或制定而不认真执行保安制度，更恶劣的竟以欺骗手段蒙蔽工人去做危险的工作。有的虽然制定了一些规程和制度，但形同虚设，不向工人进行安全生产的教育，致使工人没有安全的知识，因而违反操作规程和劳动纪律，事故发生后他们还诿过于工人。有的工厂、矿山的领导者平时不计划或不善于计划工作，前松后紧，为了赶任务，即不顾安全，盲目发动工人突击，加班加点，这也是发生事故的一种原因。至于只布置或检查生产任务，而不同时布置或检查安全卫生工作，因而助长了基层行政领导人员和工会干部的单纯任务观点和锦标主义，这更是普遍的现象。在安全监察组织方面，一般的工厂、矿山都不很健全，有的还没有建立，有的虽然建立了，但领导上不予重视，配备干部不强而且随意抽调，因而保安工作无人负责，劳动纪律废弛。更恶劣的是某些厂、矿的干部对事故发生的原因完全推到客观方面，企图推卸领导上应负的责任。这是完全错误的。
    各级厂、矿企业的行政领导人员和工会干部必须认识安全生产的重要性。只有领导上关心职工的生命与健康，才能进一步激励广大职工增产节约的积极性和创造性；同时也只有减少或避免伤亡事故，才能符合增产节约的总精神。领导上的官僚主义必须克服，必须加强对工人的安全生产教育，一方面纠正老工人中的经验主义，加强生产纪律性；一方面发动他们监督安全生产。
    为了保障职工的安全与福利，各地厂矿企业除应贯彻和充实有关劳动保护的制度、改善安全设备、加强防护工作以外，还应该建立与健全对安全生产监察的机构。检举与揭发那些忽视安全生产的失职人员，保证安全卫生设备之逐渐改善。同时各地厂、矿企业还应该充分发挥企业奖励基金的作用，并在财务计划中将必要的安全卫生设备的开支列入年度预算之内。目前各地厂、矿企业特别应该有重点地、切实地进行一次关于安全和卫生的大检查。今后各级领导机关考核企业工作的成绩，不仅应该检查他们完成计划的程度，还应该将他们对于职工安全和福利的工作列为评绩的标准。
