The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will soon be held in Beijing this September to satisfy the aspirations of millions of peace-loving people. This conference is of particular significance at a time when the international situation is tense and warmongers are trying to ignite the flames of world war in Asia. It is of particular significance because it is a stern warning to those warmongers who regard the Asian continent as a stage for their new bloody adventures.

This conference will be attended by representatives from dozens of countries with a total population of more than 1.5 billion. This conference will further unite the people of the world and further strengthen their belief in the solidarity and friendship of the countries, large and small, of the Pacific.

Now is the most appropriate time to expose to world opinion the heinous plans of the United States, which are directed against the countries of Asia and the Pacific, and to expose the provocative actions that the aggressors are preparing to take and are conspiring to use as a fuse to start a major war.

In any Asian country, no matter who you talk to about the international situation, the simplest person will draw your attention to Korea and make you aware of the shocking consequences of the war of aggression in this unfortunate and heroic country.

I recently visited India, where representatives of intellectuals and ordinary people expressed their concern about Korea in unison. They believe that the crimes of cruelly slaughtering women, children, and the elderly, and destroying peaceful cities, villages, and crops, are premeditated, unprecedented in their cruelty, and unparalleled in their barbarity. They worry that if the war expands, the same disasters will befall the cities, villages, and peaceful residents of India, because this disaster is inseparable from endless plans of aggression.

The peoples of Asia and the Americas have no doubt that the infuriated aggressors are attempting to destroy human civilization, and that if the peoples of all countries do not resolutely protest and stop the aggressors, the horror of destruction will continue to expand.

Napalm bombs, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons, which have been used in Korea and have aroused protests from all mankind, are actually real. Only a few naive people (whose charitable hearts prevent them from thinking otherwise) do not believe that the aggressors' inhumanity has reached such a point. Indeed, the aggressors' inhumanity is not false at all. Haven't you heard General Clark and his ilk openly declare that the American aggressors want to destroy seventy-eight cities in Korea? And they are not just talking about it; they are already doing it. Wherever there are people living, they will be poisoned, whether it is a small village or even a solitary hut in a mountain窝.

The barbarity and cruelty of the aggressors are truly unprecedented, even surpassing the atrocities of the so-called colonial wars known to date. How can we explain their actions?

Only by reviewing international events over the past century can the people of Asia understand the origins of the barbaric policies pursued by the aggressors in the East.

Then, those who want to understand the truth will find that the events in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and Burma today only demonstrate the dying struggle of colonial oppression and the last malicious attempt by the aggressors to subjugate the people of the Asian continent in order to continue their policies of plunder and oppression. This policy, on the contrary, has promoted the unity and resistance of Asian countries fighting for national independence and peace.

In Vietnam, villages are destroyed and peaceful residents are slaughtered; in Malaya, insane colonialists destroy villages along with their residents and abuse the people with cruelty—these war horrors are the product of dying colonial policies. The people who have endured oppression for generations have gradually awakened, and tomorrow they will drive the aggressors out of the last piece of land in Asia. However, the aggressors, who are bent on making a fortune from the national resources of Asian countries, are unwilling to give up.

Great Free China is a brilliant example, illustrating that once the people seize power, the land belongs to the tillers, not to the landlords; once the masses of the people acquire culture and technology; and once the forces that hinder historical progress and enslave this heroic nation are swept away, new life will flourish.

Isn't it because the unfortunate, blood-soaked Korea finally saw the light of freedom and began to live a rational and cultured life that it was forced to pay a heavy price? Isn't it because the aggressors, dazed by their hatred of free people, launched a frenzied attack on the Korean people because they broke free from the shackles of slavery and resolutely embarked on the road of progress?

Aren't the colonialists trying to use the massacres of Malayans and Vietnamese to stop people from naturally moving towards light and freedom?

No one has seen Koreans and Chinese invade any country or destroy any peaceful towns in California or any other state in the United States, which are separated from their homeland by vast oceans.

Today, human progress has the technological conditions necessary to promote peaceful relations and cultural exchange between countries, especially since they eliminate distance; however, the aggressors have seized these advances and used them for the purpose of slaughter and destruction.

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference must carefully study the threats facing Asian countries caused by the American aggression plans. These aggression plans stipulate attacking Free China from Taiwan and Burma, expanding the Vietnam War, and carrying out other bloody provocations in order to spread the flames of war to the entire Asian continent.

These events may have tragic consequences for the South American countries along the Pacific coast. Due to the American rearmament plan, the people of South American countries are groaning under heavy taxes. In fact, these countries are becoming increasingly impoverished and are gradually becoming dependent countries, where residents cannot even get the most essential things, where culture is declining under the blows of reactionaries, where democratic achievements are gradually lost, and where democratic movements are subjected to all kinds of suppression.

Even a country like Canada, which has not pursued a policy of conquest, is beginning to be overwhelmed by the shackles of reaction and the burden of preparing for a world war. Finally, all these countries have to pay "blood" taxes to the aggressors, which means that they have to send troops wherever the aggressors want them to go.

At the same time, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference must pay special attention to the Japanese issue. The residents of this densely populated country, who a few years ago were driven by their own imperialists to "conquer the world" and endured oppression, are now subjected to the oppression of a new imperialism, which is arming them and making them soldiers of its own armed forces under the pretext that Japan is threatened by "mysterious aggressors." In fact, we already know that Japanese troops participated in the war against the armed forces of North Korea. Captured Japanese soldiers openly admitted that they were forced to fight against the North Korean army, and that their troops were only part of a large armed force that was being rebuilt by the American aggressors. The American aggressors are using war criminals to command this army, and these war criminals are the very generals who, not long ago, were planning to conquer not only the entire Asia, but even the United States.

Today, the American aggressors are openly rearming Japan and secretly planning to use the Japanese army as its vanguard in the bloody sea of future wars. That is to say, they are planning to launch a criminal war against the people of Asia, just like the criminal war launched by Japan in the past, which sacrificed millions of lives. Due to the arrogant plans of the Japanese aggressors, hundreds of thousands of Americans paid with their lives. It was only because the victorious Soviet army participated in the war and defeated the elite Kwantung Army stationed in Manchuria and Korea that the plans of these conquerors were shattered. Today, these conquerors have been revived by the American aggressors. The American aggressors have also inherited bacteriological weapons from their confidant "friends."

For those who thoroughly understand the meaning of the so-called San Francisco Peace Treaty, this treaty is obviously illegal because it has not been recognized by the people of Asian countries who participated in the war against Japanese imperialism. Therefore, it should be replaced by a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, so that there is no need to worry about the rearmed Japanese imperialism invading the people of Asian countries again under a new banner—whether it is under the Stars and Stripes or under the light blue United Nations flag with a globe on it.

The Japanese people are suffering from enslavement, living a colonial life, their cultural forces are being destroyed, and their democratic movements are being brutally suppressed. The people of Asian and Pacific countries cannot remain indifferent to the difficult situation of the Japanese people.

The people of Asian countries are more clearly aware than ever before that they have sufficient strength to fight for their cultural development, for peace, and for peaceful relations and cultural exchange between all countries (near and far) and all nations (large and small). The people of Asian countries want to eliminate national oppression throughout Asia, and they hope that the great cultural achievements of all countries will become the common property of all civilized humanity—regardless of skin color or form of government.

There is no doubt that this peace conference will firmly advocate strengthening cultural exchange, because this will help the people of the world increase their understanding of each other, promote cultural cooperation, eliminate the propaganda of hatred of mankind; this propaganda has created racial segregation, national discrimination; this propaganda wants mankind to return to the barbaric era, so that aggressors can use slander, incitement, and instigation of mutual hatred among nations to create disunity among all ethnic groups in order to reap the benefits.

Only in this way can the arms race be ended, and the unnecessary fears of the so-called inevitability of war and the so-called certainty of a new world war can be eliminated.

One of the favorite tricks of aggression propaganda is to make people think that New China and the Soviet Union will definitely attack the United States and all countries that have concluded military agreements and treaties with the United States.

In order to confuse their people and prepare them for aggression, American propagandists repeat this claim in various ways day and night. They do this in order to constantly maintain an atmosphere of terror and to make their people obey their war plans.

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will have an excellent opportunity to expose the lies of the aggressors' propaganda, because representatives from countries across the Pacific will personally see the peaceful and prosperous New China, which has no intention of attacking any other country and is busy carrying out great construction work on a national scale.

The representatives will see the Soviet Union's new Five-Year Plan. The draft of this plan has been widely publicized in newspapers, and this draft explains what the Soviet people will do in the coming years, how great changes they will make in the development of the Soviet peaceful economy, and what great tasks they will carry out in order to develop culture and science, and to move towards full prosperity, so as to improve the living and working conditions of the Soviet people as much as possible.

The representatives participating in the peace conference will thoroughly understand the life of the republics of Central Asia, whose socialist system has developed to an astonishing height, and whose economic welfare and cultural achievements have become well-known. The people of China, India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan are well aware of the living conditions of these countries when they were still Tsarist colonies. Today, they have become advanced countries in economy, advanced in production, advanced in science and art.

The Soviet people, in carrying out their great peaceful work, are not disturbed by the hysteria that imperialists have widely spread among the American people, for example. We have never held atomic bomb prevention exercises in schools, children do not have to huddle under their desks in fear, no one shouts "We must learn to kill" in our youth clubs, we have a law that stipulates that those who promote war should be brought to justice, and we have no bases thousands of kilometers away from our territory.

The Soviet people believe in their own strength. They were very happy when they heard the news of the peace conference, because they also have full rights to consider themselves the people of the Pacific region, because their Asian territories have been invaded more than once.

The Soviet people learned of the decision to convene the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference at various gatherings, speeches, and in newspapers and magazines. They welcomed this decision, because they are the Soviet people dedicated to the cause of peace. They prove their loyalty to the cause of peace with their daily peaceful labor. They support the decisions of Asian and American countries, which is to oppose the threat of war, oppose colonial oppression, oppose imperialist adventures, oppose everything that hinders cultural exchange between countries, oppose everything that hinders the establishment of trade and other relations, and oppose the remilitarization of Japan.

The Soviet people advocate a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and advocate an end to the Korean War. The Soviet people protest the use of bacteriological weapons, which have been banned by the Geneva Conference, and protest the use of napalm bombs and other bombs to massively slaughter peaceful residents and destroy cities and villages.

The Soviet people, like all other peace-loving people in the world, believe that this peace conference will greatly contribute to the struggle of the people of all countries for their national independence, territorial integrity, the unity of the people of the Pacific region, and the consolidation of peace in the Pacific and the world.

    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民为和平而奋斗
    苏联拥护和平委员会主席  尼古拉·吉洪诺夫
    为了满足千百万爱好和平的人民的愿望，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将于今年九月在北京举行。在这个国际局势紧张，战争贩子极力想在亚洲点燃世界大战的火焰的时候，这个会议是具有特别意义的。它之所以具有特别意义，是因为它对于那些把亚洲大陆当作他们进行新血腥冒险的舞台的战争贩子们是一个严厉的警告。
    这次会议将有人口共十五亿以上的数十个国家的代表参加。这次会议将进一步团结世界各国人民，进一步坚定他们对于太平洋大小国家的团结和友好的信念。
    要向世界舆论揭穿美国的针对着亚洲及太平洋各国的憎恨人类的恶毒计划，揭穿侵略者正在准备采取、并阴谋用作发动大战的导火线的挑衅行动，现在是最适当的时机了。
    在任何一个亚洲国家，无论你跟谁谈到国际局势，最单纯的人都会把你的视线引向朝鲜，使你注意到侵略战争在这个不幸的、英勇的国家造成的触目惊心的后果。
    最近我曾到印度去过一趟，那里的知识分子和普通人民的代表们一谈起朝鲜，都众口一声地表示忧虑，他们认为残酷地屠杀妇女、儿童和老年人、毁灭和平的城市、乡村和庄稼的罪行是处心积虑的，它的残忍是空前的，野蛮是无与伦比的，他们担心一旦战争扩大，同样的灾祸就会降临到印度的城市、乡村与和平居民的头上，因为这种灾祸与无止境的侵略计划是分不开的。
    亚洲和美洲各国人民毫不怀疑，恼羞成怒的侵略者是企图毁灭人类文明的，如果各国人民不坚决抗议，不拉住侵略者的手，那末，毁灭的恐怖就会继续下去，以至于扩大。
    已在朝鲜使用、并引起了全人类抗议的凝固汽油弹、化学武器、细菌武器都是实际存在的东西，只有少数天真的人（这些人的慈善心肠使他们不能有其他的想法）才不相信侵略者的惨无人道竟到了这种地步。不错，侵略者的惨无人道是一点也不假的，你没有听见克拉克将军之流公开宣布美国侵略者要毁掉朝鲜的七十八个城市吗？而且他们不只是说说而已，他们已经在干这种勾当了，凡有人住的地方都要遭受荼毒，小村庄是如此，甚至连山窝里的孤零零的茅屋也不能幸免。
    侵略者的野蛮和残忍真是空前绝伦，连迄今所知的所谓殖民战争的残暴也望尘莫及，用什么来说明他们的这种行径呢？
    唯有亚洲人民重温近百年来的国际事件，才能明了侵略者在东方执行的野蛮政策的来龙去脉。
    于是想明白真相的人们就会发现：今天朝鲜、越南、马来亚和缅甸的事件只是表明了殖民压迫的临死挣扎和侵略者最后的恶毒企图，他们妄图使亚洲大陆的人民就范，以便继续执行他们的掠夺和压迫政策，这个反而促成了正在为民族独立与和平而斗争的亚洲各国的团结和反抗的政策。
    在越南，村庄被毁灭，和平居民遭受屠杀；在马来亚，丧心病狂的殖民者把村庄连它们的居民一起毁灭，对人民滥施残暴；——这些战争恐怖都是垂死的殖民政策的产物。世世代代忍受压迫的人民已经渐渐觉醒，他们明天就要把侵略者从亚洲的最后一片土地上赶走，然而，一心要靠亚洲各国人民的国家资源发财致富的侵略者是不肯甘心的。
    伟大的自由中国就是一个光辉灿烂的范例，它说明了：一旦人民掌握了政权，土地归耕者所有，而不为地主所有，一旦人民群众获得了文化和技术，一旦阻碍历史前进、奴役这个神勇的民族的势力被扫除了，新生活就会欣欣向荣。
    难道不幸的、鲜血淋漓的朝鲜不正是因为它的人民终于看到了自由的光芒，并开始过着理性的、有文化的生活，而被迫要付出重大的代价吗？由于憎恨自由人民而神志昏迷的侵略者伙帮不正是因为朝鲜人民挣脱了奴隶的锁链，坚决地走上了进步的道路而对他们发动疯狂进攻吗？
    难道殖民者不是企图用屠杀马来亚人和越南人的办法，来阻止人民自然地走向光明和自由吗？
    谁也没有看见朝鲜人和中国人侵略过任何国家，摧毁过和他们的祖国远隔重洋的加利福尼亚州，或者美国任何其他一州的任何和平城镇。
    今天，人类的进步已具备了充分的技术条件，这种条件本来是可以用来促进各国人民之间的和平关系和文化交流的，尤其是因为它们消灭了距离，所以更能如此；可是，侵略者攫夺了这些进步的成果，利用它们来干屠杀毁灭的勾当。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议必须仔细研究美国侵略计划所造成的面临着亚洲各国的威胁。这些侵略计划规定从台湾和缅甸进攻自由中国，扩大越南战争，并进行其他的血腥挑衅，好把战火蔓延到整个亚洲大陆。
    这些事件对于太平洋沿岸的南美各国可能产生悲惨的后果。由于美国的重整军备计划，南美各国的人民正在繁重的赋税之下呻吟。事实上，这些国家越来越穷困，正逐渐沦为附属国，那里的居民连最必需的东西也得不到，那里的文化在反动派的打击下日渐衰落，那里的民主成果渐渐丧失，民主运动受到各种各样的镇压。
    即使像加拿大这样一个并未奉行征服政策的国家，也开始被反动的枷锁和准备世界大战的重负压得透不过气来。最后，所有这些国家都不得不向侵略者缴纳“血”税，这就是说，侵略者要它们往哪里派兵，它们就得往哪里派。
    同时，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议必须特别注意日本问题。这个人口稠密的国家的居民，在不几年以前还被他们本国的帝国主义分子驱使着去“征服世界”，忍受着压迫，今天，他们又受到了新帝国主义的压迫，这个帝国主义正在以日本受到“神秘的侵略者”的威胁为藉口，来武装他们，使他们成为它自己的武装部队的兵士。实际上，我们已经知道有日本部队参加了对北朝鲜武装部队的战争。被俘的日本兵士毫不隐讳地承认他们是被迫对北朝鲜军队作战的，而且他们的部队只不过是正由美国侵略者重新建立中的一支庞大的武装部队的一部分。美国侵略者正在起用战犯来指挥这支军队，而这些战犯正是不久前还在计划不仅要征服整个亚洲、甚至要征服美国的那些将军们。
    今天，美国侵略者正在公开地重新武装日本，秘密地计划把日本军队当作它的先头部队，投入将来战争的血海，这就是说，他们计划对亚洲人民发动罪恶战争，就像过去日本发动的那次牺牲了千百万生命的罪恶战争一样。由于日本侵略者的狂妄计划，数十万美国人付出了他们的生命，仅仅由于百战百胜的苏军参加战争、打垮了驻在满洲和朝鲜的关东军精锐部队，才粉碎了这些征服者的计划。今天，这些征服者又被美国侵略者救活了。美国侵略者同时还从他们的心腹“朋友”那里继承了细菌武器。
    对于那些透彻了解所谓旧金山和约的意义的人们说来，这个条约显然是非法的，因为它没有得到曾参加对日本帝国主义作战的亚洲各国人民的承认，因此，应该用一个全面的对日和约来代替它，这样，就用不着担心重新武装起来的日本帝国主义在新的旗帜下——无论是在星条旗下，还是在画有一个地球的浅蓝色的联合国旗帜下，再度侵略亚洲各国人民了。
    日本人民正在遭受奴役，过着殖民地的生活，他们的文化势力受到摧残，他们的民主运动受到残酷的镇压。对于日本人民的这种困难处境，亚洲及太平洋区域各国的人民不能够漠然无动于衷。
    亚洲各国人民比以前任何时候都清楚地意识到，他们有充分的力量，来为他们的文化发展、为和平、为一切国家（无论远近）和一切民族（不分大小）之间的和平关系和文化交流而斗争。亚洲各国人民要在整个亚洲范围内消灭民族压迫，他们希望各国的伟大的文化成就成为全体文明人类——不分肤色或政权形式——的共同财产。
    毫无疑问，这次和平会议将坚决主张加强文化交流，因为这样才能帮助世界各国人民增加彼此间的了解，才能促进文化合作，扩大贸易，消灭憎恨人类的宣传；这种宣传造成了种族隔阂、民族歧视；这种宣传要人类回到野蛮时代去，以便于侵略者用诽谤、挑拨、教唆各民族互相仇视的办法，来造成各族人民的不团结，以坐收渔人之利。
    只有这样，军备竞赛才能结束，所谓战争不可避免、所谓新世界大战一定会发生之类的无谓的恐惧才能消除。
    侵略宣传最爱玩弄的花样之一，就是使人们以为新中国和苏联一定会进攻美国以及所有曾和美国缔结军事协定及条约的国家。
    为了迷惑他们的人民并使他们准备从事侵略，美国宣传家们日日夜夜以各种方式重复着这种说法。他们这样做，是为了经常保持恐怖的气氛，并使他们的人民服从他们的战争计划。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将有一个极好的机会来揭穿侵略者的宣传谎言，因为太平洋彼岸各国的代表将亲自看到和平繁荣的新中国，它没有进攻任何其他国家的意图，它正忙于进行全国规模的伟大建设工作。
    代表们将看到苏联的新五年计划。报纸已广泛地宣传了这个计划的草案，这个草案说明了苏联人民在今后几年中将做些什么事情，说明了他们将在苏联和平经济的发展方面造成怎样巨大的变化，也说明了他们为了发展文化和科学、为了走向充分的繁荣，以便尽可能提高苏联人民的生活和劳动条件，将执行那些伟大的任务。
    参加和平会议的代表们将透彻地了解中亚细亚各共和国的生活，这些共和国的社会主义制度已发展到惊人的高度，它们所得到的经济福利和文化成就已经远近皆知。中国、印度、巴基斯坦、伊朗和阿富汗的人民是深知这些国家在它们还是沙皇殖民地的时代的生活状况的。今天，它们已经成为先进的经济、先进的生产、先进的科学和艺术的国家。
    苏联人民在进行他们的伟大的和平工作时，并没有受到，比如说，帝国主义者在美国人民中间广泛散布的歇斯底里的惊扰。我们从来没有在学校里举行过预防原子弹的演习，儿童们不必胆战心惊地在课桌底下缩做一团，在我们的青年俱乐部里，没有人高喊“我们必须学会杀人”，我们有一项法律，它规定，凡是宣传战争者应受审判，而且，我们没有距离我们的领土几千公里的基地。
    苏联人民相信他们自己的力量，他们听到召开和平会议的消息时，都十分高兴，因为他们也有充分的权利认为他们是太平洋区域的人民，因为他们的亚洲领土曾不止一次地受到侵略。
    苏联人民在各种集会上、演说中和报章杂志上知道了召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决定，他们欢迎这个决定，因为他们是献身于和平事业的苏联人民，他们以他们每天的和平劳动来证明他们对于和平事业的忠诚，他们拥护亚洲和美洲国家的决定，这个决定就是：反对战争威胁、反对殖民压迫、反对帝国主义的冒险、反对一切妨碍各国人民文化交流的东西、反对一切妨碍建立贸易和其他关系的东西、反对日本的重新军国主义化。
    苏联人民主张和平解决朝鲜问题，主张停止朝鲜战争。苏联人民抗议使用已为日内瓦会议所禁用的细菌武器，抗议使用凝固汽油弹和其他炸弹来大规模屠杀和平居民和毁灭城市村庄。
    苏联人民和全世界所有其他爱好和平的人民一样，相信这次和平会议将大大有助于各国人民为争取他们的民族独立、领土完整、太平洋区域各国人民的团结、太平洋及全世界和平的巩固而进行的斗争。
