	The Peking Opera "The Romance of the West Chamber" Revised Successfully
	The Peking Opera "Hong Niang," adapted from "The Romance of the West Chamber," is a very popular opera. Xun Huisheng and Yuan Yunyi, a cadre of the Beijing Cultural Affairs Bureau, have carefully revised it. After being performed by the Liuxiang Troupe led by Xun Huisheng, it has received unanimous praise. The old version of "Hong Niang" only emphasized the role of Hong Niang, neglected the main character in the story, Cui Yingying, and some actors' performances inappropriately catered to low and vulgar tastes, diluting the anti-feudal color of the original work. The revised "Hong Niang" corrects these shortcomings, deletes the low and vulgar parts of the original play, clarifies the character of Yingying, and retains the good "scenes" and techniques of the original play, making the theme clear and the performance effect very good. The revision of this play was not based solely on personal subjective intentions, nor was it carried out by means of crude dismantling, but rather by literary and art cadres and opera performers working closely together, discussing, researching, raising questions, and revising. Although the changes in this play are not many, it has a completely new look. At the same time, this work has also strengthened the artists' confidence in reforming old plays and preserved the excellent programs of Peking Opera.

    京剧“红娘”修改得有成绩
    由“西厢记”改编的“红娘”是一个很流行的京剧，现已经荀慧生及北京市文化事业管理处干部袁韵宜慎重地做了修改，并由荀慧生领导的留香剧团演出后，获得一致的好评。因为旧本“红娘”只强调了红娘的作用，冷落了故事中的主要人物——崔莺莺，某些演员的表演，又不恰当地迎合低级庸俗趣味，冲淡了原作反封建的色彩。修改后的“红娘”纠正了这些缺点，删除了原剧的低级庸俗部分，明朗了莺莺的人物性格，并保留了原剧好的“场子”和技巧，使得主题明确，演出效果也很好。这个戏的修改，不是仅凭个人主观意图，采取大拆大卸的粗暴手段进行的，而是文艺干部和戏曲艺人在密切的合作下，共同商量、研究、提出问题、进行修改的。这个戏虽然改动的地方不多，但已面貌一新了，同时，通过这一工作，也更增强了艺人改革旧戏的信心，并保留了京剧的优秀节目。“时事手册”第十七期内容介绍
    “时事手册”第十七期已经出版。这一期以纪念中华人民共和国建国三周年为中心，登载了一篇宣传提纲，叙述三年来我国在政治、经济和抗美援朝战争中的伟大成就，并指出这些成就已为即将展开的国家大规模建设准备好了条件。此外还有一篇谈三年来工农业生产的发展的，有一篇建国第三年的大事月表。这一期还有一篇关于一九五二年农业税收方针的文章，解释了什么叫做查田定产、依率计征等问题，指出征收农业税是按常年产量，不是按丰收产量，也不是按丰产地产量。这一期的“亚洲及太平洋区域国家介绍”专栏介绍了马来亚、阿富汗王国、尼泊尔王国、锡兰。
