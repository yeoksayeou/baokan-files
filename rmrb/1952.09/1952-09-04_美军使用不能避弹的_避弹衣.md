Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd—After suffering huge losses in the war of aggression, the American aggressors are actually trying to use something similar to the armor worn by medieval knights – "nylon bulletproof vests" – on the modern Korean battlefield. They vainly attempt to reduce massive casualties and salvage their soldiers' increasingly low morale. However, the Volunteer Army soldiers who have fought against American soldiers wearing this armor regard this trick of the American aggressors, who are playing games with the lives of their soldiers, as a source of amusement.

The soldiers of the 1st Marine Division, one of the main forces of the American invading army which has suffered heavy casualties in the constant incursions near Panmunjom, were the first to be used by the American invaders as guinea pigs for bulletproof vests. As early as this spring, the American news agencies, like a drowning man clutching at a straw, chattered endlessly about this ancient armor, touting it as an invention that could "greatly reduce the number of combat casualties" and a "supreme achievement." However, the facts on the battlefield have proven that this "nylon bulletproof vest," made of twelve layers of nylon sheets and weighing eight pounds and four ounces, can neither stop bullets nor shrapnel. Volunteer Army soldiers hung the captured "nylon bulletproof vests" on trees fifty or sixty meters away, and then used captured American carbines to shoot at them. The bullets not only penetrated the armor, but also penetrated more than an inch deep into the tree trunk. Since late March, the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps has lost more than 3,000 men in the incursions near Panmunjom, many of whom were killed or wounded while wearing this armor. The "bulletproof vests" on the abandoned enemy corpses were left with traces of being riddled with holes by our army's gunfire and artillery fire. An American news agency sadly described the scene of an American soldier's injury, saying: "Wearing nylon armor… a burly Marine was struck in the chest by shrapnel from a mortar, and three ribs were broken."

When the "trick" of the American generals was exposed by the facts on the battlefield, they stopped boasting about their invention that "saves soldiers' lives." They mumbled through the news agencies to their soldiers: "This armor is not bulletproof. A 30-millimeter bullet can penetrate it!"

American soldiers fighting in "nylon bulletproof vests" have added a new action on the battlefield, that is, when they are attacked by our army, they immediately take off this heavy armor and throw it on the ground, and then run away as fast as their legs can carry them. Because they believe that running backwards on their own two legs may be more effective in avoiding artillery shells and bullets than the "armor" boasted by their generals.

### 美军使用不能避弹的“避弹衣”

    美军使用不能避弹的“避弹衣”
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】美国侵略者在侵略战争中遭受巨大的损失之后，竟然试图在现代化的朝鲜战场上使用类似中世纪骑士穿的铠甲——“尼龙避弹衣”来了。他们妄想以此来减少大量伤亡和挽救其士兵愈来愈低的士气。但与穿着这种铠甲的美国士兵作过战的志愿军战士们，却对美国侵略者这个拿其士兵生命开玩笑的把戏引为谈笑的资料。
    首先被美国侵略者当作避弹衣试验品的，是在板门店附近不断进犯中遭受惨重伤亡的美国侵略军主力之一海军陆战队第一师的士兵。早在今年春天，美国通讯社就像一个溺水者抓住了一根稻草一样，喋喋不休地把这种古代式的铠甲吹嘘成为可以“大大减少作战伤亡数字”的“最高成就”的发明。可是战场的事实证明，这种用十二层尼龙薄片制成的、八磅四盎司重的“尼龙避弹衣”，既挡不住子弹、也挡不住弹片。志愿军战士们把缴获来的“尼龙避弹衣”挂在五、六十公尺远的树上，然后用缴来的美国卡宾枪对准射击，子弹不仅穿透铠甲，而且穿进树身一寸多深。美国陆战队第一师自三月下旬以来，已经在板门店附近的进犯中损失了三千多人，其中有许多人就是穿着这种铠甲死伤的。那些被遗弃的敌人尸体上的“避弹衣”，留有被我军枪火炮火打得千疮百孔的痕迹。美国通讯社悲哀地描述一个美军士兵伤亡的情景说：“穿着尼龙铠甲的……一个身体粗壮的海军陆战队兵士被迫击炮的霰弹刺进了胸部，三根肋骨被打断了。”
    当美国将军们的“把戏”被战场的事实戳穿之后，不再吹嘘他们“拯救士兵生命”的发明了，他们通过通讯社嗫嚅地告诉他们的士兵们说：“这种战衣并不是不怕枪弹的，一颗三十公厘口径的枪弹就可以射穿它！”
    穿着“尼龙避弹衣”作战的美国士兵们，在战场上增加了一个新的动作，即是当他们一遭到我军打击的时候，就马上把这件沉重的铠甲脱下来丢在地上，然后拔腿逃走。因为他们相信用自己的两条腿向后飞跑，也许能避开炮弹和枪弹的袭击，这要比他们将军们吹嘘的“铠甲”灵验得多。
