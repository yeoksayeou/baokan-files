Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: Since the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was signed in Beijing on June 1st this year, the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association has repeatedly submitted barter trade manifests to the China National Import and Export Corporation via telegram. Lu Xuzhang, manager of the China National Import and Export Corporation, promptly replied to the above barter manifests, expressing agreement on all items except ramie in the first batch, and proposed a list of goods needed by the Chinese side. However, despite numerous telegram exchanges between China and Japan during this period, no specific transactions were concluded. In order to effectively and quickly implement the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and expand Sino-Japanese trade, Lu Xuzhang has made several suggestions to Kazuo Suzuki, Managing Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, on issues such as cargo manifests, communication, prices, trade methods, and approaches. These suggestions were telegraphed to Kazuo Suzuki on the 19th by Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.

In the telegram, Lu Xuzhang proposed a cargo manifest based on the requirements of previous telegrams from the Japanese side and the possible supply and demand situation between China and Japan. Lu Xuzhang pointed out: "This cargo manifest includes a wide variety of items and a large quantity. Although individual transactions are one way of proceeding, experience has shown that it is very difficult to complete a large agreement solely through telegram exchanges. In order to promote its specific realization, we hope that your side will organize representatives from relevant manufacturers as soon as possible to come to Beijing in the near future to conduct specific discussions with us."

Regarding the price issue, Lu Xuzhang believes that it will be easy to reach an agreement if both parties simultaneously consider the prices of import and export commodities and thereby determine reasonable prices.

Based on his successful experience in negotiating and implementing the Moscow International Economic Conference agreement with various Western European countries, Lu Xuzhang also offered suggestions on trade methods and approaches, saying: "The most effective and best method is to conduct unified negotiations, determine import and export cargo manifests, prices, specifications, and conditions, sign specific contracts for import and export simultaneously and separately, and have the bank guarantee, using a third country's currency to settle the tail-end difference or settle with materials."

Lu Xuzhang hopes that Kazuo Suzuki can telegraph the organization of the negotiation delegation and the date of their arrival in China.

    卢绪章向日方提出执行贸易协议几项建议
    【新华社十九日讯】自从中日贸易协议于今年六月一日在北京签订以后，日本中日贸易促进会曾通过电讯多次向中国进出口公司提出易货贸易货单。中国进出口公司经理卢绪章对以上易货货单已及时复电表示除第一批中之苎麻一项以外，其他都同意，并提出中国方面所需要的货单。但是，在此期间，中日双方电讯往还虽多，并没有达成具体交易。为有效地迅速地执行中日贸易协议，展开并扩大中日贸易，卢绪章特就货单、联系、价格、贸易的方式和方法诸问题，向中日贸易促进会常务理事铃木一雄提出几项建议。这些建议在十九日已由中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸电转铃木一雄。
    卢绪章在电文中提出了根据日方先后来电的要求及中日双方供需可能情况所拟订的货单。卢绪章指出：“此项货单包括的品种多，数量大，个别交易虽是进行方式之一，但经验证明，完成一个大的协议，单单通过电讯往返来联系，是很困难的。为促其具体实现，希你方从速组织有关厂商代表，于最近期内来北京统一与我进行具体商谈。”
    关于价格问题，卢绪章认为双方如对于进出口商品的价格同时加以考虑，从而确定合理价格是容易达成协议的。
    卢绪章并根据他和西欧各国谈判执行莫斯科国际经济会议协议的成功经验，就关于进行贸易的方式和方法提出建议说：“统一谈判，确定进出口货单、价格、规格及条件，进出口同时分别签订具体合同并经过银行保证，以第三国货币作为清算尾差或以物资清偿，为最有效最好的方法。”
    卢绪章希望铃木一雄能电告谈判代表组织情况和来中国日期。
