To the Editor: The Nanpo Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Lishi County, Shanxi Province, leads the masses in using new methods of reading newspapers to promote the current central work.

Before the newspaper reading group led by the Nanpo Village Branch reads the newspaper, the newspaper reader first raises questions based on the central content of the newspaper, combined with the central work of the village, to guide everyone in the discussion. Finally, the newspaper reader finds the answers from the newspaper based on the different questions raised by everyone in the discussion and reads them to everyone. This can appropriately solve the ideological problems of the masses. For example, when Nanpo Village carried out lending work, the newspaper reader Li Mingdao organized the newspaper reading group to discuss the problems in the lending work. Many ideological problems were exposed in the discussion. For example, some grain-deficient households had the idea of ​​not wanting to pay interest or only borrowing and not repaying; some grain-storing households were unwilling to lend. Li Mingdao explained to these farmers based on the central government’s instructions on carrying out rural lending work published in the newspaper. After the explanation, the grain-storing households were willing to lend, and the grain-deficient households also expressed that they would pay interest and return grain. The lending work in the whole village was also launched.

This method of reading newspapers can cultivate farmers’ interest in learning. For example, in the patriotic health campaign, someone once asked: "Why do you get sick after eating flies?" This aroused a heated debate among everyone. Some people found some hygiene knowledge materials from the newspaper about explaining fly-borne diseases and read them to everyone. This made everyone understand a lot of hygiene knowledge and aroused everyone's interest in learning.

Since the Nanpo Village Branch adopted this method of reading newspapers, it has raised the political consciousness of the farmers in the entire village a step further, and various tasks have become easier to do.

    离石县南坡村党支部领导群众读报推动了工作
    编辑同志：中共山西省离石县南坡村支部，领导群众用新的读报方法推动了当前的中心工作。
    南坡村支部领导的读报组在读报之前，先由读报员根据报纸的中心内容，结合村里的中心工作，提出问题，引导大家进行讨论，最后由读报员针对大家在讨论中所提出的不同问题，从报纸上找到答案，读给大家听。这样能够很恰当地解决群众的思想问题。例如当南坡村开展借贷工作时，读报员李明道就组织读报小组讨论借贷工作中的问题。在讨论中暴露了许多思想问题。例如有些缺粮户存在着不愿交息或只借不还的思想；有些存粮户就不肯出借。李明道就根据报上登载的中央关于开展农村借贷工作的指示，向这些农民作了解释。经过解释以后，存粮户愿意出借了，缺粮户也表示要交息还粮。全村的借贷工作也就展开了。
    这种读报方法能够培养农民的学习兴趣。例如在爱国卫生运动中，曾有人问：“为什么吃了蝇子要生病？”这就引起了大家热烈的争论。有人就从报上找了一些关于解释蝇子传染疾病的卫生常识材料给大家读。这样使大家懂得了很多卫生常识，引起了大家的学习兴趣。
    南坡村支部自从采用这种读报方法后，已使全村农民的政治觉悟都提高了一步，各种工作也容易作了。
