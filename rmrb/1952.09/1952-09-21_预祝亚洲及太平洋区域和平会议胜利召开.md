    A Victory for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference
    Hundreds of millions of people on both sides of the Pacific warmly welcome the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference which is about to open in Beijing. Thirty-two peace-loving countries have each selected representatives or delegations to attend the conference. These peace warriors are carrying the wishes of the people of their respective countries for peace and solidarity and cooperation, and are flocking to our nation's capital, Beijing.
    Since the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in June, the peace movement of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region has made significant progress. The declaration of the preparatory meeting and the proposals regarding the various preparatory works for this conference have been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people of various countries. Many countries have held large-scale peace rallies and carried out various peace activities. Through the preparatory work for this conference, people who were still outside the peace movement yesterday are today raising the banner of defending peace by the thousands and tens of thousands and are surging into the movement. There is no doubt that the desire of hundreds of millions of people for peace and against war will guarantee the successful success of this conference.
    The Chinese people sincerely hope that this conference will be a complete success. At present, the people of our country are launching production increase competitions and other activities to welcome the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The reason why the Chinese people attach such importance to this peace conference is because we deeply understand that peace is the basic condition for our people to engage in large-scale construction. One of the highest interests of the Chinese people is to maintain and consolidate lasting peace among nations, which is an undeniable fact.
    The reason why the Chinese people attach such importance to this conference is also because we deeply understand that through this conference and the widespread peace-keeping movement in various countries, we can further raise the awareness of the people of various countries and strengthen the unity of the people of various countries, and further mobilize and organize the forces of the people of various countries to effectively stop war and defend peace. The Chinese people are clearly aware that the interests of the imperialist warmongers are completely opposed to the interests of the vast majority of people in all countries. The highest interests of the vast majority of people in all countries, including the vast majority of people in the United States, is peace, not war. But in the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, and with the United States at the head, there are imperialist aggressive forces that yearn for new wars. They need war in order to obtain excessive profits and plunder other countries. These war-mongers, who account for a very small percentage of the population of their countries, are the big monopoly capitalists or their agents with billions of dollars in assets. They believe that war is a lucrative business that generates huge profits. And the aggressive war policies that American war-mongers are pursuing in the Far East today—delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, continuing the Korean War, attempting to destroy the national liberation movements of the oppressed countries through the establishment of military bases, the implementation of political control and military aggression, reviving the Japanese militarist forces as the main tool for expanding aggression, and implementing blockades and embargoes to stifle economic exchanges and cultural exchanges between the peoples of various countries—these are the total source of the war threat suffered by the peoples of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region today. The most important condition for the continued implementation of this sinful aggressive war policy is that they can continue to deceive the people with various lies, causing the vast majority of people in their countries to fall into a state of unconsciousness. Therefore, mobilizing and organizing the people of all countries to defend peace is of great importance at present. As Stalin, the standard-bearer of the world peace cause, said: "If the people of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the war-mongers succeed in trapping the masses of the people with a web of lies, deceiving the masses of the people, and dragging the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable. It is for this reason that the widespread movement to maintain peace, as a tool to expose the evil conspiracies of the war-mongers, is now of the greatest significance."
    There is no doubt that peace in Asia and the Pacific region can be maintained and consolidated, and the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, which is about to be held victoriously, is a powerful proof. The plot of American imperialists to turn the countries of Asia and the Pacific region into their own dominion and colonial exploitation zone and to turn them into a base for launching another world war is bound to fail. This is because the face of Asia and the Pacific region today is very different from what it used to be. China has emerged from the state of being enslaved, weak and unpromising, and has become a powerful oriental fortress of peace. The increasingly strengthened unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee for stopping new threats of aggression and defending peace in Asia and the Pacific region and peace in the whole world. The heroic Korean people and Vietnamese people are waging victorious struggles to defend the independence of their motherlands and peace in the Far East and the world. In other countries in this region, the movement to defend peace and fight for national independence is also developing rapidly. The upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is a concentrated expression of the 1.6 billion people of Asia and the Pacific region defending peace and fighting for peace. This conference will be of epoch-making significance. We wish this conference a successful success.

### 预祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议胜利召开

    预祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议胜利召开
    太平洋两岸的亿万人民热烈地欢迎即将在北京开幕的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。三十二个国家爱好和平的人民已经各自选出了出席会议的代表或代表团。这些和平战士正带着各国人民要求和平、要求团结合作的意愿，络绎前来我国首都北京。
    自六月间亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议举行以来，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的和平运动已经有了显著的发展。筹备会议的宣言和关于这个会议各项筹备工作的提议，获得各国广大人民的热烈拥护。许多国家都举行了规模巨大的和平集会，并开展了各种和平活动。通过这次会议的筹备工作，昨天还置身在和平运动之外的人们，今天正在成千成万地举起保卫和平的旗帜，汹涌地投入运动中来。亿万人民要求和平、反对战争的愿望，毫无疑问必将保证本次会议的胜利成功。
    中国人民是热诚希望这次会议能够获得完满成功的。目前我们全国各地的人民正在展开迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的增产竞赛和其他各种活动。中国人民所以异常重视这次和平会议，是因为我们深刻地了解，和平乃是我国人民从事大规模建设的基本条件。中国人民的最高利益之一，就是维护和巩固国际间的持久和平，这是谁都无法否认的事实。
    中国人民所以异常重视这次会议，还因为我们深刻地了解，通过这次会议以及在各国广泛开展的维护和平运动，就能进一步地提高各国人民的觉悟和加强各国人民的团结，就能进一步地动员和组织各国人民的力量，来有效地制止战争和保卫和平。中国人民清楚地知道，帝国主义战争贩子的利益和各国绝大多数人民的利益，是完全相反的。各国绝大多数人民，包括美国的绝大多数人民在内，他们的最高利益，是和平，而不是战争。但是在美国、英国、法国以及日本，而以美国为首，却有着帝国主义的侵略势力渴望新的战争。他们需要战争以便获得超额的利润，以便劫掠其他国家。这些占他们国家人口的极少数的战争贩子，就是那些家财亿万的大垄断资本家或其代理人，他们认为战争是产生巨大利润的有大利可图的事情。而美国的战争贩子们今天在远东所推行的侵略战争政策——拖延朝鲜停战谈判，继续进行朝鲜战争，用设立军事基地、实行政治控制和军事侵略的办法来妄图摧毁各被压迫国家的民族解放运动，复活日本军国主义势力以作为其扩大侵略的主要工具，实行封锁和禁运以窒息各国人民之间的经济往来和文化交流，这些就是今天亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民所蒙受的战争威胁的总来源。这种罪恶的侵略战争政策所以能够继续推行，最重要的条件就是他们能够继续用各种谎言来欺骗人民，使他们国家的广大人民陷于不觉悟的状态。因此，动员和组织各国人民来保卫和平，在目前就有极大的重要性。正如世界和平事业的旗手斯大林所说：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那么战争就可能变得不可避免。就是因为这个缘故，广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，现在具有最重大的意义。”
    毫无疑义，亚洲和太平洋区域的和平是能够保持和巩固的，即将胜利召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，就是一个有力的证据。美国帝国主义者妄想把亚洲和太平洋区域各国变成他们自己的统治区和殖民地剥削区，变成他们发动又一次世界战争的根据地的阴谋，是一定要失败的。这是因为，亚洲和太平洋区域今天的面貌，和以前相比是大不相同了。中国已脱出被奴役的积弱不振的状态，而变成为强大的东方和平堡垒。中苏两国人民日益加强的团结，则是制止新侵略威胁、保卫亚洲和太平洋区域的和平以及全世界的和平的坚强保障。英雄的朝鲜人民和越南人民，正为保卫自己祖国的独立和远东及世界的和平而进行着胜利的斗争。在这个区域中的其他各个国家，保卫和平和争取民族独立的运动也在迅速发展。即将召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，就是亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民保卫和平和争取和平的集中表现。这个会议，将是有划时代意义的。我们预祝这个会议胜利成功。
