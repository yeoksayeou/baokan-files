    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to open in Beijing. Representatives elected by the people of more than 30 countries will make their greatest efforts to save peace in the Asian and Pacific regions and to seek a happy and prosperous life for 1.6 billion people. This is truly an exciting and joyous event. As a Catholic, I wish the conference success.
    The convening of this peace conference fully conforms to the wishes and expectations of the vast number of peace-loving people. Chinese Catholics, along with the people of the whole country, unanimously support this peace conference. Because the spirit of this conference is in line with the Catholic doctrine of advocating peace and opposing aggression.
    According to Catholic doctrine, all human beings, regardless of race or territory, are brothers and sisters and should love each other and live in peace. Any violation of the freedom of others, occupation of the property of others, or harm to the lives of others is a serious crime that violates religious rules and doctrine.
    Chinese Catholics today understand that the world is facing a war crisis due to the imperialists' policy of arms expansion and war preparation. In Asia alone, aggressors such as the United States, Britain, and France are endlessly waging wars in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other places, occupying other countries' territories, interfering in other countries' internal affairs, enslaving other countries' people, and suppressing national liberation movements. They massacre innocent and good residents and kill patriotic people who strive for independence and freedom. The American army has even carried out heinous germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and has indiscriminately bombed peaceful cities in the rear of Korea, killing a large number of women and children and destroying many cultural relics. What a heinous and inhumane crime! Chinese Catholics resolutely oppose such bestial acts and hate these crimes.
    The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference at this time is very necessary. Because the preparatory meeting of this peace conference has indicated that its purpose is to save peace; to demand the democratization of Japan and oppose the re-militarization of Japan; to demand universal disarmament and oppose the use of atomic, bacterial, and chemical weapons to massively slaughter human beings; to demand the restoration of normal international trade relations and cultural exchanges and to oppose blockades and embargoes; to demand peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems, not to invade others, nor to be invaded by others; to oppose the use of force to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries; to help each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, to promote each other's peaceful construction, to improve people's welfare, and to seek common development. These purposes are all righteous and in complete accord with Catholic doctrine.
    Chinese Catholics have long been blinded by imperialism. Today, they have broken free from imperialist rule, opened their eyes, recognized the abominable face of imperialism, and are filled with indignation and hatred towards the imperialists' preparation to launch a large-scale war of aggression. Chinese Catholics are willing to contribute all their strength to defend lasting world peace.
    It is hoped that Catholics in all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, in the spirit of justice, kindness, courage, and universal love of Jesus Christ, will unite to fight against wars of aggression and defend world peace.
    Peace will surely triumph over war! Victory will surely belong to the people!

    中国天主教徒热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    天主教北京教区副主教  李君武
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议最近就要在北京开幕了。三十多个国家的人民所选出的代表，将要为拯救亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，并为十六亿人民谋求安居乐业的幸福生活而作最大的努力。这真是一件令人万分兴奋的喜事。我以天主教人士的身份，预祝大会的成功。
    这次和平会议的召开，完全符合广大爱好和平人民的愿望和期待。中国天主教徒和全国人民一道，一致拥护这个和平会议。因为这次会议的精神与天主教主张和平反对侵略的教义正相吻合。
    按天主教的教义讲，人类不分种族、不分畛域，彼此都是兄弟手足，应当互相友爱，和平共处。凡侵犯他人的自由，占据他人的财产，伤害他人的生命，都是违犯教规，违背教义的重大罪行。
    中国天主教徒今天了解到由于帝国主义的扩军备战的政策，世界已面临战争危机。只就亚洲来讲，美、英、法等侵略者在朝鲜、越南、马来亚等地，正在无休止地进行着占据他国的领土，干预他国的内政，奴役他国的人民，镇压民族解放运动的战争。他们屠杀无辜善良的居民，戕害争取独立自由的爱国人士。美国军队更在朝鲜和中国东北等地进行了万恶的细菌战，并在朝鲜后方滥炸和平城市，大量地杀死妇女儿童，毁灭了很多文化古物。这是如何伤天害理，违反人道的罪行！中国天主教徒坚决反对这样的兽行，痛恨这些罪恶。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在此时际召开是非常必要的。因为这个和平会议的筹备会议已昭示了它的目的就是要拯救和平；就是要求日本民主化，反对日本的重新军国主义化；要求普遍裁军，反对使用大规模地屠杀人类的原子武器、细菌和化学武器；要求恢复正常的国际贸易关系和文化交流，反对封锁和禁运；要求不同制度的国家和平共处，不侵略别人，也不受别人侵略；反对以武力干涉别国的内政；在平等互利的基础上，有无相助，促进彼此的和平建设，来提高人民福利，求得共同发展。这些目的都是正大光明的，和天主教的教义完全符合。
    中国天主教徒曾长时期受帝国主义蒙蔽，今天已摆脱了帝国主义的统治，睁开了眼睛，认识了帝国主义的可恶面目，对帝国主义准备发动大规模的侵略战争，充满了义愤和憎恨。中国天主教徒为了保卫世界持久和平，愿贡献出一切力量。
    希望亚洲及太平洋区域各国的天主教徒们，本着耶稣基督的正义、善良、勇敢、博爱的精神，一致起来为反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平而斗争。
    和平必能战胜战争！胜利必然属于人民！
