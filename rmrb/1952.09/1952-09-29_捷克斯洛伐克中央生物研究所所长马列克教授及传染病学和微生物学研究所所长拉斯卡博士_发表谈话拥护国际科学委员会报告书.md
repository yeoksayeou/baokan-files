Professor Marek's Statement

Professor Marek, Director of the Central Biological Institute of Czechoslovakia, issued a written statement to Xinhua News Agency regarding the report of the "International Scientific Commission for Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China." The full text of the statement is as follows:

All our scientists have been consistently opposed to the use of bacteria as a weapon for mass slaughter of people from the very beginning. The best proof of this is that when we first heard about the attempt by American imperialists to use bacteriological weapons, we immediately issued an urgent warning. At the Sixth Congress of Czechoslovak Microbiologists held in September 1950 – which was attended by representatives from the Soviet Union, various People's Democracies, People's China, and the German Democratic Republic – all the delegates unanimously decided at the closing session to demand that the United Nations prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons as weapons for the mass slaughter of defenseless people. They also called on American microbiology groups to prevent their country's microbiological science from serving the shameful purposes of the aggressors. Therefore, when we scientists heard the news from North Korea and Northeast China at the beginning of 1952 that the American interventionist forces had used bacteria against the Korean and Chinese people, we were extremely angry. When we had the opportunity to carefully study the convincing pictorial evidence and diagnostic reports, we were even more angry and realized the cunning and despicable means they had used.

I have had the opportunity to inform the broad masses of our people about all this evidence. I have spoken to school children about it, and I have seen how contemptuous they are of those who use these means. I have also spoken to factory workers, urban and rural citizens, and officers and soldiers in our army. All the citizens of our country, who are actively engaged in peaceful construction for our good life, have unanimously expressed their abhorrence of the despicable means of the imperialists, who have abused the science that has so far achieved so much in human health care. The universities in our country, especially the medical schools of the universities, protested against the use of bacteriological weapons; none of our famous and outstanding medical doctors (professors at the Prague Medical School) – Professor Laufberger, Professor Divis, Professor Borovansky, Professor Wolff, Professor Jedlička, and Professor Šarlat – concealed their contempt for those who despicably defiled science.

But whenever we talk to our working people about this matter, in addition to seeing their hatred for the aggressors, we also encounter another aspect of the reaction to the imperialists' evil acts: a determination to do everything possible to prevent the same thing from happening to our people. No one doubts that the imperialists may use the experience they gained in Korea in our country as well. They have even launched bacteriological warfare in our country; they have spread potato beetles in our fields. Since we have been able to defeat this attack by the imperialists through the efforts of our working people, especially with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, in scientific and technological measures, we can also stop any attempts to wage bacteriological warfare against us, and everyone who has talked to us about this matter is convinced of this. Now, after receiving new evidence from the renowned international authoritative scientists who have investigated all the materials on the bacteriological warfare in China and Korea on the spot, not only has our hatred for the imperialists become stronger, but our determination in every aspect has also been strengthened. All our microbiologists, epidemiologists, hygienists, and infectious disease experts, at the recent Seventh Congress of Microbiologists in Brno, as scientific workers, made the following guarantee: to further intensify the work of protecting the health of our working people, to vigorously carry out health and epidemic prevention work, and to create a solid foundation for preventing any imported infectious diseases. We greatly admire and respect the heroic soldiers and people of Korea and China, who have effectively stopped this inhumane attack by the American aggressors. (Xinhua News Agency)

Dr. Raška's Statement

Dr. Raška, MD, Director of the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology of Czechoslovakia, issued a written statement to Xinhua News Agency regarding the report of the "International Scientific Commission for Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China." The full text of the statement is as follows:

Not long ago, the world saw more irrefutable evidence of the United States' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China.

After two months of investigation in North Korea and China by the International Scientific Commission composed of distinguished scientific workers from five Western countries (Britain, Italy, Sweden, France, and Brazil) and a Soviet representative, it was fully confirmed that these two countries had suffered from American bacteriological weapons attacks. These people are all experts who are competent to do this work, and this is evidenced by the following fact: for example, Dr. Joseph Needham of Cambridge University, a member of the commission, was entrusted by the British government during the Second World War to investigate the facts of Japan's bacteriological warfare against China.

This International Scientific Commission systematically studied all documentary materials and the evidence collected by health workers and staff of the Korean Scientific Research Institute and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and once again revealed the true face of the American aggressors.

Moreover, the recently published confessions of captured American Air Force officers explained more important technical details about the methods of the United States' organization and conduct of bacteriological warfare against North Korea and Northeast China.

We were shocked when we saw this new evidence of bacteriological warfare crimes, and we, along with all peace-loving people in the world, denounce the shameless and futile attempts of the American aggressors to cover up their crimes.

The evidence collected by the International Scientific Commission, like the evidence presented by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and other great representatives of the peace camp, is a huge contribution to the cause of peace.

For us scientific workers who study epidemiology and microbiology, this evidence further inspires and requires us to strengthen and improve our work to promote human health and welfare. Following the example of Soviet progressive science, the purpose of our work is to strive to prevent and eradicate various infectious diseases.

We Czechoslovak scientific workers, with admiration and gratitude, are always concerned about the heroic Korean and Chinese people who are bravely resisting the mad attacks of American imperialism. We fully know that the Korean and Chinese people can also be said to be fighting for us. In this unprecedentedly vicious, cruel and inhumane bacteriological war, the Chinese and Korean fighters have taken on all the dangers.

Progressive mankind and the vast majority of scientific workers stand on the side of humanity and peace. Therefore, bacteriological warfare can only prove the weakness of the imperialist aggressors, and it is doomed to failure. (Xinhua News Agency)

    发表谈话拥护国际科学委员会报告书
    马列克教授的谈话
    捷克斯洛伐克中央生物研究所所长马列克教授就“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”的报告书向新华社记者发表书面谈话，谈话的全文如下：
    我国的所有科学家从一开始就一致反对用细菌来作为大批屠杀人民的武器。最能够证明这一点的是当我们第一次听到美帝国主义者企图使用细菌武器时，我们就立即大声疾呼地发出紧急警告：在一九五零年九月间举行的捷克斯洛伐克微生物学家第六届大会上——苏联、各人民民主国家、人民中国和德意志民主共和国的代表都曾参加这次大会——全体代表在闭幕时一致决定要求联合国禁止用细菌武器作为大批屠杀手无寸铁的人民的武器；他们又呼吁美国各微生物学家团体防止他们国内的微生物科学为侵略者的可耻目的服务。因此，当一九五二年年初我们科学家听到从北朝鲜和中国东北传来的消息说美国干涉军已用细菌对付朝鲜和中国人民时，我们感到非常愤怒。当我们有机会仔细研究具有充分说服力的图片证据和诊断报告书后，我们感到更加愤怒，并由此认识到他们已使用了何等狡猾和卑鄙的手段。
    我有机会使我国广大的人民群众知道所有这些证据。我曾和学校儿童们谈到此事，我看到他们对于那些使用这些手段的人们是何等的蔑视。我也曾向工厂工人、城市和乡村的公民们以及我们军队里的官兵们谈过此事。正在积极地为了我们的美好生活而从事和平建设的我国所有公民们，对于帝国主义者的卑鄙手段都一致表示憎恶，帝国主义者滥用了迄今在人类保健方面已有很多成就的科学。我国各大学，特别是各大学医学院，都抗议使用细菌武器；我国著名的、卓越的医学博士们（布拉格医学院的教授们）——劳福贝尔格教授，狄维斯教授，波罗凡斯基教授，伍尔夫教授，叶德利卡教授和夏尔发特教授——没有一个人掩盖他们对于那些卑鄙地玷污科学的人们的蔑视。
    但是每当我们和我国劳动人民谈到此事的时候，除了看见他们对侵略者表示憎恨以外，我们还碰到对于帝国主义者的丑恶行为的另一方面的反应：决心尽力防止同样的事情发生在我国人民的身上。帝国主义者也可能把他们从朝鲜取得的经验同样用在我国，这一点已经没有人怀疑了。他们甚至在我国也曾发动过细菌战，他们曾在我国田野间散播过马铃薯甲虫。既然由于我国劳动人民的努力、特别是在苏联无私的援助下所采取的科学和技术上的措施，我们能够打败帝国主义者的这次进攻，我们也能制止对我们进行细菌战的各种企图，凡是与我们谈过此事的人，都深信这一点。现在，在得到那些在现场调查过在中国和朝鲜进行细菌战的一切材料的著名国际权威科学家所提出的新证据后，不但我们对于帝国主义者的憎恨变得更为强烈了，而且我们在每一方面的决心都加强了。我们所有微生物学家、流行病学家、卫生学家和传染病学专家，最近在布尔诺举行的微生物学家第七届大会上，以科学工作者的身份提出了下列保证：进一步加紧保护我国劳动人民健康的工作，大力进行卫生和预防流行病的工作，为预防任何输入的传染病创造巩固的基础。朝鲜和中国的英勇战士与人民已有效地制止了美国侵略者这种非人道的进攻，我们对于他们十分钦佩和尊敬。（新华社）
    拉斯卡博士的谈话
    捷克斯洛伐克传染病学和微生物学研究所所长拉斯卡医学博士就“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”的报告书向新华社记者发表书面谈话，谈话全文如下：
    不久前，全世界都看到了更多关于美国在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的不可驳倒的证据。
    由五个西方国家（英国、意大利、瑞典、法国和巴西）的杰出科学工作者和一位苏联代表组成的国际科学委员会在北朝鲜和中国进行了两个月的调查后，充分证实了这两个国家曾遭受过美国细菌武器的攻击。这些人都是可以胜任这项工作的专家，这一点可以由下面的事实得到证明：例如，委员会委员、英国剑桥大学的李约瑟博士，在第二次世界大战期间曾受英国政府之托调查日本对中国进行细菌战的事实。
    这个国际科学委员会有系统地研究了全部文件性材料以及卫生工作者和朝鲜科学研究所、中国科学院的工作人员搜集的证据，再度揭露了美国侵略者的真正面目。
    而且，不久以前发表的美国被俘空军军官的供词，说明了关于美国对北朝鲜和中国东北组织及进行细菌战的方法的更多的重要技术细节。
    我们看到这个关于细菌战罪行的新证据时，感到十分震惊，我们和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，痛斥美国侵略者掩盖他们的罪行的无耻的、徒劳无功的企图。
    国际科学委员会搜集的证据，像国际民主法律工作者协会与和平阵营的其他伟大代表们提出的证明一样，是对和平事业的一个巨大贡献。
    对于我们研究传染病学和微生物学的科学工作者，这些证据进一步鼓舞我们和要求我们加强并改进我们的促进人类健康和福利的工作。按照苏联进步科学的榜样，我们工作的目的是努力防止并根绝各种传染病。
    我们捷克斯洛伐克科学工作者以敬仰和感激的心情，时刻挂念着正在勇敢地抵抗美帝国主义者的疯狂进攻的英勇的朝中人民。我们完全知道，朝中人民也可以说是在为我们进行战斗。在这个空前恶毒的、残酷的非人道的细菌战争中，中朝战士担当了全部的危险。
    进步人类和绝大多数的科学工作者是站在人道与和平方面的。所以，细菌战只能证明帝国主义侵略者的孱弱，它是注定要归于失败的。（新华社）
