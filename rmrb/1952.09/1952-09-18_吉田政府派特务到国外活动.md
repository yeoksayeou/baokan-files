Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese Yoshida government has decided to dispatch Japanese spies abroad to collude and cooperate with other puppet groups under the aegis of the United States to conduct espionage activities.

According to the Japanese evening newspaper "Tokyo Shimbun," the Japanese spy agency "Public Security Investigation Agency," which was recently expanded from the so-called "Special Examination Bureau," recently held a meeting of senior officials. The meeting decided to first dispatch "overseas investigators" to Hong Kong, Keelung in Taiwan, Busan and Seoul in Korea to engage in intelligence gathering. In order to realize this plan, the "Public Security Investigation Agency" will hold specific talks with other relevant government agencies. The newspaper also revealed that once the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs agree, they will continue to dispatch "investigators" to Washington, Berlin, Saigon, and the Balkans.

    吉田政府派特务到国外活动
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府决定派遣日本特务人员到国外去与美国卵翼下的其他傀儡集团勾结合作，进行间谍活动。
    据日本晚报“东京新闻”透露，不久以前由所谓“特别审查局”扩大而成的日本特务机关“公安调查厅”，最近举行了一次高级官员会议，会上决定首先派遣“海外调查员”到香港、台湾的基隆、朝鲜的釜山和汉城这四个地方去，从事搜集情报的工作。为了实现这个计划，“公安调查厅”将与其他有关政府机关进行具体会谈。该报同时透露，一俟日本大藏省和外务省同意以后，还要继续派遣“调查员”到华盛顿、柏林、西贡和巴尔干等地。
