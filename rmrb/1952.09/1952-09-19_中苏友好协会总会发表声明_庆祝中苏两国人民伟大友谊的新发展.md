Xinhua News Agency, September 17th:

    The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement on the 17th, warmly congratulating the great achievements of the negotiations between the Chinese and Soviet governments and expressing heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their lofty and selfless friendship. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    The negotiations between the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Government have achieved brilliant results. The Sino-Soviet announcement on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China and the exchange of notes between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries on extending the term of joint use of the Chinese naval base of Port Arthur fill us with boundless excitement and encouragement. We wholeheartedly thank the Soviet Government and the Soviet people for their lofty and selfless friendship, and warmly hail this major measure which further consolidates the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and is conducive to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.
    From the Sino-Soviet announcement on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China, we can see how faithfully the Soviet Government adheres to the international treaties and agreements it has concluded. All the rumors and provocations of the imperialists on Sino-Soviet relations have been completely shattered! The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a brotherly and sincere friendship, and it is forever unbreakable!
    Our government proposed to the Soviet government to extend the term of joint Sino-Soviet use of the Chinese naval base of Port Arthur, and the Soviet government agreed to this proposal. This is a completely necessary measure taken in accordance with the current international situation to prevent the recurrence of Japanese aggression and to maintain peace and security. Because, as Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, said in his letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky: "Since Japan refused to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty and concluded a unilateral treaty with the United States of America and several other countries, Japan has therefore not concluded a treaty with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and seems unwilling to conclude a treaty"; Japan is colluding with the United States to expand its armaments and prepare for war; since Japan has organized an army under the name of "Police Reserve Force," and the "Police Reserve Force" has already participated in the war of aggression against Korea; in this situation, the people of China and the Soviet Union, who bear a major mission in maintaining peace in the Far East, cannot but take necessary measures. Extending the term of joint use of the Port Arthur naval base until the People's Republic of China and Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan conclude treaties is precisely within the scope of these necessary measures. Therefore, we warmly support this exchange of letters and thank Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin for their wise leadership.
    This new and enormous achievement of Sino-Soviet friendship will further consolidate and develop the unity and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, and at the same time it is a heavy blow to the imperialists. All the conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism are doomed to utter bankruptcy in the face of the Sino-Soviet alliance!
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association warmly celebrates this new and great development of Sino-Soviet friendship, and will vigorously publicize the great significance of this development, so that the broad masses of our people will once again receive a profound education in internationalism, thereby further consolidating and developing the great friendship and increasingly powerful strength of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, and fighting to defend world and Far Eastern peace.

    中苏友好协会总会发表声明
    庆祝中苏两国人民伟大友谊的新发展
    【新华社十七日讯】中苏友好协会总会十七日发表声明，热烈祝贺中苏两国政府谈判的伟大成就，并对苏联政府和苏联人民的崇高无私的友谊表示衷心的感谢。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府代表团与苏联政府的谈判，获得了辉煌的成果。中苏关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告和两国外交部部长关于延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文，使我们感到无限的兴奋与鼓舞。我们衷心感谢苏联政府和苏联人民的崇高无私的友谊，热烈欢呼这种进一步巩固中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，并有利于远东与世界和平事业的重大措施。
    从中苏关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告里，我们可以看出苏联政府是何等信守它所缔结的国际条约和协定。帝国主义者在中苏关系上的一切造谣与挑拨被彻底粉碎了！中苏两国的友谊是兄弟般的真诚的友谊，它是永远牢不可破的！
    我国政府向苏联政府提议延长中苏共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地的期限，苏联政府同意了这个提议。这是按照目前国际局势作出的防止日本侵略的重演、维护和平与安全的完全必要的措施。因为正如我国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来在致苏联外交部部长维辛斯基的去文中所说：“自从日本拒绝缔结全面和约并与美利坚合众国以及其他若干国家缔结片面和约后，日本因此未与中华人民共和国和苏联订立和约，看来也不愿意订立和约”；日本正在与美国勾结起来，扩军备战；日本既然在“警察后备队”的名义下组织军队，并且“警察后备队”已经参加对朝鲜的侵略战争；在这种情况下，对于维护远东和平事业负有重大使命的中苏两国人民，自不能不采取必要的措施。延长旅顺口海军根据地共同使用的期限，直至中华人民共和国与日本和苏联与日本缔结和约为止，正是在这种必要措施范围之内。因此我们热烈地拥护这一换文，并感谢毛主席和斯大林大元帅的英明领导。
    中苏友谊这一新的巨大的成就，将使中苏两国人民的团结合作更进一步地巩固和发展，同时它也是对帝国主义者的沉重打击。美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计在中苏同盟面前都是注定要彻底破产的！
    中苏友好协会热烈庆祝中苏友谊这一新的巨大发展，并将大力宣传这一发展的伟大意义，使我国广大人民再一次受到深刻的国际主义的教育，从而更加巩固与发展我们中苏两国的伟大友谊和日益强大的力量，为保卫世界和远东和平而斗争。
