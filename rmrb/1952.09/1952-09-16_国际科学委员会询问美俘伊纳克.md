Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China interrogated Kenneth L. Enock, a captured American Air Force lieutenant navigator, in a certain location in Korea.

Enock first reported his name and origin to the members of the commission. He talked about the bacteriological warfare courses he heard in Iwakuni, Japan, and Gunsan, Korea, and specifically described the various methods of using bacteria in combat that the instructor Wilson spoke about in the courses. He gave a detailed account to the commission of his participation in dropping bacteriological bombs in Huangzhou on January 7 and in Zhonghe on January 11. The content of his statement is completely consistent with the content of his confession made on April 7.

After Enock finished his statement, the members of the International Scientific Commission raised questions, which Enock answered one by one.

Oliver (Italy) asked: "Have you ever studied aviation regulations and rules of conduct in combat and international regulations prohibiting the use of certain combat methods?" Enock replied: No, we haven't studied that. We only learned some rules about the treatment of prisoners of war, and even those were not learned much.

Next, Zhukov-Velesnikov (Soviet Union) and Andreen (Sweden) asked Enock what he and his comrades thought about conducting bacteriological warfare. Enock replied: I really didn't think we would be conducting bacteriological warfare. It was a terrible blow to me that we were going to do this in North Korea. It seemed like it happened by accident. But when I carried out the second mission, I was very surprised, because we were really conducting bacteriological warfare, not accidentally, but regularly. I was very surprised, but the rules of secrecy made us have to act as if nothing had happened in our squadron. Captain Ames (the pilot on the same plane as Enock) was very upset about this. He had carried out many missions and of course wanted to go home, but the bacteriological warfare thing was a big blow to him. Captain Ames is a regular officer. He has dedicated himself to his country, and that is why he felt so shaken. Because he is now contributing his life to this kind of thing. Now he understands that he was wrong.

Oliver asked whether he had heard, during the lectures or when receiving orders, that it was a bacteriological warfare experiment or a large-scale bacteriological warfare operation. Enock said that he had not heard whether it was a bacteriological warfare experiment or a real bacteriological warfare operation. He said: It can be inferred that we may really be using this thing, not just treating it as an experiment.

Enock then answered questions from Martel (France), describing his experiences. He said: Briefly, after graduating from high school, I worked in a steel factory in my hometown of Youngstown. I joined the Air Force in 1943. I served for forty-five months, and performed twenty-one missions, sixteen of them flying B-24s in China, and five in Okinawa. After I retired in early 1947, I returned to work in the steel factory to earn money to continue studying at university. In the first summer, I had to work in two factories. After completing two years of electrical engineering courses, I went to work at the Youngstown power plant in February 1949, and went to night school at night. In September 1950, I was drafted as an active soldier and went to Langley Base, and left the United States for Iwakuni in August 1951.

When answering the question raised by Joseph Needham (Britain) about his impressions of China when he was in China and his views on China, Enock said that he had previously been stationed in Luliang, Yunnan. He said: The local residents were very kind. They built runways for our airport. They didn't have any tools, but what they completed was a huge project. When I was captured, I thought I would be punished immediately or shot, tortured, etc. But when my guns were confiscated, they shook hands with me, gave me cigarettes, and assured me that nothing would happen to me. I couldn't believe it for a while, because I was always nervous. But I realized that these were the people I met in Luliang. The same people, the same sincerity and kindness, at least put me at ease. Since then, I have maintained this attitude. The Chinese and the Chinese People's Volunteers have indeed treated me very well. Everyone I came into contact with treated me almost like a brother, which was very touching and helpful. But what impressed me the most was not their behavior towards me personally. In the long run, this is less important. It is most important to have some understanding of the country itself. I have read Epstein's "China's Unfinished Revolution", Falconer's "New China, Friend or Foe" and many pamphlets and magazines about China. These books are very inspiring. The changes in China are fundamental, changing for the better, much better.

Enock answered the question raised by Martel about following military orders. He said: If you disobey unimportant orders, that's a small matter. But if it's something like conducting bacteriological warfare, you can expect severe punishment. There are some examples of this, not refusing to conduct bacteriological warfare, but someone refusing to serve in Korea. Although they were not shot, people will make your life miserable. He said that at the time, his personal calculation was that his flight mission might not be entirely to drop bacteriological bombs, so after completing the mission he could go home.

Before the questioning ended, Enock said to the members of the committee: I come before you as someone who participated in this bacteriological warfare, actually participated in this cursed and hateful crime against humanity. I once served these lunatics who have launched a terrible challenge to peace-loving people all over the world. A few senior officials in the US government launched this mass slaughter and ordered me to violate my conscience and will and commit this crime - to do dirty work for them, dropping bacteria and insects on innocent civilians, men, women and children in North Korea. These people have every right to enjoy peace and happiness; however, I brought them misery, sadness and death. I want to sternly denounce those lunatics who launched this massacre. I condemn what I did in these crimes. My upright conscience compels me to do so. I am a normal person, I have a sense of justice, I want to testify, to prove that those who launched this bacteriological war are guilty, I want to insist on my testimony, to fight a just fight against this inhuman war, to fight for peace and for humanity. I want to ask the members present, especially to tell the American people, so that the American people can hear your words. When the American people understand the terrible truth and the terrible meaning of the challenge to humanity, they will unite to overthrow those who are doing this. They will join the fight against those people, against this act of perfidy and deception, against this mass slaughter and vile tricks. They are the people of my country, and I know that this is the truth. I admire your just and noble struggle in this battle for peace. I know that you have risked your lives to come to North Korea, to the front lines and nearby areas to collect all this conclusive evidence; I also understand that this struggle is not only for you and for me, but for all people, for all races in the world - this is a very just struggle, not only for your children and mine, but for all future children, for future generations. We should give them a better future, something truly worth being proud of, so that they can be proud of this fight to stop bacteriological warfare - if we can. You are fighting a just battle. I know I am not alone in this battle. We come from different countries, speak different languages, but we have the same heart, the same goals, the same purpose, the same noble ideals. I really want to do my part. We must let people hear our opinions, this is the most important thing. Truth will triumph. When people hear our opinions, they will understand us, and when people fully understand, every human being will have a peaceful and bright future.

After Enock finished speaking, Joseph Needham, on behalf of the members of the commission, expressed his gratitude for Enock's sincere testimony. The interrogation ended here. (Attached picture)

### 国际科学委员会询问美俘伊纳克

    国际科学委员会询问美俘伊纳克
    【新华社十五日讯】调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会，在朝鲜某地询问了被俘的美国空军中尉领航员凯尼斯·L·伊纳克。
    伊纳克首先向委员会委员们报告了他的姓名、籍贯。他谈到他在日本岩国和朝鲜群山听到的细菌战课程，并具体地叙述了讲师威尔逊在课程中讲到的用细菌作战各种方法。他向委员会详细地陈述了他
    一月七日在黄州、一月十一日在中和参加投掷细菌弹的经过。他陈述的内容和他在四月七日所作的供词的内容，是完全一致的。
    在伊纳克陈述完毕后，国际科学委员会的委员们即提出问题，由伊纳克一一作答。
    欧利佛（意大利）问道：“你曾否学习过关于航空的规章和禁止使用某些作战方式的作战行为规则和国际规章？”伊纳克回答说：没有，我们没有学习过。我们只学过一些关于对待战俘的规则，就是这些也学得不多。
    接着，茹科夫——维勒斯尼科夫（苏联）、安德琳（瑞典）问伊纳克，他和他的同伴对于进行细菌战有何感想？伊纳克回答说：我确实没有想到我们竟会进行细菌战。我们要在北朝鲜来干这种勾当，对于我是一个可怕的打击。看起来这好像是偶然发生的。但是，当我执行第二次任务时，使我觉得非常吃惊，因为我们在真正进行细菌战了，不是偶然进行，而是在经常进行。我感到非常吃惊，可是保守秘密的规定使我们在我们的大队里面不得不若无其事。阿麦斯上尉（与伊纳克同机的驾驶员）为这件事情很不安。他已执行了不少次的任务，当然很想回家去，但是，进行细菌战的事，给了他很大的打击。阿麦斯上尉是一个正规军官。他已献身给他的国家，就是因为这个缘故，使他觉得受了很大的打击。因为他现在是把他的生命贡献给这种勾当了。现在他明白他错了。
    欧利佛问他在听课或接受命令时是否听说是要进行细菌战实验或是要大规模进行细菌战，伊纳克说，他没有听说过是要作细菌战实验还是真正进行细菌战。他说：可以推断，我们可能真是使用这个东西，而不是只把它当作实验的。
    伊纳克接着回答马戴尔（法国）的问题，陈述了他的经历。他说：简单地说，当我在高中毕业后，我在我家乡杨斯顿的一个钢铁厂里工作。一九四三年参加了空军。我服役了四十五个月，担任了二十
    一次任务，其中十六次是在中国驾驶B—二十四型机，另外五次是在冲绳。我在一九四七年初退役后，重新回到钢铁厂工作，为了赚钱继续读大学，我在第一个夏季，得在两个厂里工作。当我读完二年电机工程课后，在一九四九年二月到杨斯顿的电力厂工作，在夜间去读夜校。一九五零年九月，我被征召为现役军人，前往兰格利基地，在一九五一年八月离开美国去岩国。
    在回答李约瑟（英国）提出的关于他在中国时有何观感和对中国的看法的问题时，伊纳克说，他过去曾在云南陆良驻扎过。他说：当地居民非常和善。他们为我们机场修跑道，他们并没有任何工具，但是，他们所完成的是巨大工程。当我一被俘，我想我将马上受惩办或被枪毙、遭虐待等等。但是，当我的枪枝被缴后，他们便同我握手，给我香烟，保证不会对我怎么样。一时我还不敢相信，因为我一直在紧张中。但是，我认识到这些就是我在陆良所遇到的人们。同样的人，一样的恳切和善，这至少使我放心了。从此以后，我一直抱这种态度。中国人和中国人民志愿军确实待我很好。所有我接触的人对我都几乎有如兄弟，必须说，使人非常感动，极有帮助。但是，对我印象最深的，倒不是他们对我个人的行为。从长远看来，这还是比较不太重要的。对这个国家本身有些认识，才是最关重要的。我曾读过爱泼斯坦著的“中国的未完成的革命”、发尔科纳著的“新中国，是朋友还是敌人”以及许多有关中国的小册子和杂志。这些书都使人非常感奋。中国的变化是根本的变化，是向好的、好得多的方面变。
    伊纳克回答了马戴尔提出的关于遵守军事命令的问题。他说：如果你违抗不重要的命令，那是小事情。但是，如果是进行细菌战之类的事情，你就等着受严厉惩罚吧。有些这样的例子，不是拒绝进行细菌战，而是有人拒绝在朝鲜服役，虽然没有枪毙，但人家会使你活着不得安生。他说，当时，他个人的盘算是：他的飞行任务不一定完全是投细菌弹，这样完成任务之后便可以回家。
    在询问结束前，伊纳克向委员会的委员们说：我以参加了这个细菌战、实际上参加了这个反人类的可咀咒可恨的罪行的身份，来到诸位面前。我曾为这些向全世界爱好和平的人们进行可怕的挑战的疯子们服务。在美国政府中少数高级官员发动了这种大规模屠杀，并命令我违背我的良心和意志，犯下这种罪行——替他们做龌龊的工作，把细菌和昆虫投在北朝鲜的无辜平民、男女和儿童身上。这些人民有充分的权利享受和平与幸福；可是，我却带给他们凄惨、悲伤和死亡。我要厉声斥责那些发动这个大屠杀的疯子们。我斥责我在这些罪行中所做的事。我的正直的良心，使我不得不这样。我是一个正常的人，我有正义感，我要作证，证明那些发动了这个细菌战的人是有罪的，我要坚持我的证词，来和这惨无人道的战争作正义的斗争，为和平为人道而斗争。我要请求在座的委员们，尤其要告诉美国人民，使美国人民能听到你们的言论。当美国人民明了了可怕的真相和向人道挑战的可怖的意义时，他们会团结一致起来打倒那些进行这一勾当的人。他们会参加反对那些人的战斗，反对这种背信弃义和欺骗的行为，反对这种大规模的屠杀和丑恶的伎俩。他们是我的国家的人民，我深知这是真情。我敬佩诸位在这个为和平的战斗中的正义崇高的斗争。我知道你们冒了重大的生命危险来到北朝鲜，到前线和附近地区搜集所有这些确凿的证据；我也了解这一斗争不仅是为了你们和为了我，而是为了全体人民，为了全世界的各个种族——这是一个十分正义的斗争，不仅是为了你们的孩子和我的，是为了所有未来的孩子，为了后代。我们应该给他们较好的未来，一些真正值得骄傲的事情，使他们对这次制止细菌战——如果我们能够的话——的斗争感到骄傲。你们正在进行一场正义的战斗。我知道我在这个战斗中并不孤独。我们来自不同的国家，说着不同的语言，可是，我们有着同样的心，同样的目标，同样的目的，同样高尚的理想。我实在愿尽我的一份力量。我们一定要让人们听到我们的意见，这是最重要的事情。真理将会得到胜利。当人们听到我们的意见时，他们会了解我们，当人们充分了解的时候，全人类每一个人都将有和平和光明的未来。
    伊纳克发言完毕后，李约瑟代表委员会的委员们，对于伊纳克所作的恳切的证词，表示谢意。询问至此结束。（附图片）
