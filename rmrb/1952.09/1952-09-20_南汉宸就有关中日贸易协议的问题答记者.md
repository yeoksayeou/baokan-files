Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: This reporter, in order to understand the situation after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the specific issues related to the implementation of the agreement, interviewed Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, on the 19th, and asked him to answer some questions. The questions raised by the reporter and Nan Hanchen's answers are as follows:

Question: What has been the reaction of the Japanese people since the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was signed?

Answer: Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, it has been widely supported and endorsed by the vast majority of the Japanese people. Many Japanese manufacturers have been constantly writing to us since the agreement was signed, proposing the materials they require for trade, which have reached more than 70 kinds so far. It can be seen that the Japanese people and non-governmental industrialists and businessmen are eager to realize Sino-Japanese trade.

Question: What attitude has been adopted towards these requests?

Answer: We have always maintained a faithful attitude towards fulfilling the signed Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. We have made reasonable replies to the materials requested for exchange by Japanese manufacturers in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. For materials within the agreement, we have expressed our willingness to trade in our replies. In order to promote the specific implementation of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and sign specific contracts, we have sent letters and telegrams several times inviting them to send representatives to Beijing for specific discussions, but this has not yet been realized.

Question: How is the transportation problem solved when exchanging materials?

Answer: The main issue in transportation is the use of ships. During my negotiations with Mr. Takayoshi, Mr. Hozumi, and Mr. Miyakoshi, there was a preliminary understanding that the use of Japanese ships could be considered, and they could directly dock at Chinese ports. However, specific issues such as the ports where Japanese ships dock, entry procedures, and other related navigation issues must be resolved through face-to-face consultation between the two parties.

Question: How is the payment problem handled?

Answer: In principle, it is barter trade, but the payment method can be handled flexibly. In addition to direct barter trade, opening letters of credit through third-country banks is also a viable solution. If there are more suitable methods when the two parties negotiate in person in the future, they can also be considered.

Question: How is the price of traded goods determined?

Answer: The price issue can be adjusted based on the principle of fairness and reasonableness when the two parties discuss it in detail in the future.

In short, all specific technical issues related to trade must be resolved satisfactorily through face-to-face consultation between the two parties.

    南汉宸就有关中日贸易协议的问题答记者
    【新华社十九日讯】本社记者为了解中日贸易协议签订后的情况及有关具体执行协议的问题，特在十九日访问中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸，提出了一些问题请予答复。本社记者所提出的问题及南汉宸的答复如下：
    问：中日贸易协议签订后，日本人民有何反应？
    答：自从中日贸易协议签订后，已引起日本广大人民普遍的支持和拥护。日本许多厂商在协议签订后，不断给我们来信，提出他们要求交易的物资，到目前为止已达七十余种。可见日本人民和民间工商业者是迫切要求实现中日贸易的。
    问：对他们这些要求，采取了什么态度？
    答：我们对所签订的中日贸易协议自始至终是抱着忠实履行的态度的。对日本厂商来信要求交换的物资，均根据协议的规定，作了合理的答复：凡属协议内的物资，我们都已在复信中表示愿意交易。为了促成中日贸易协议的具体执行并签订具体合同，曾数次函电邀请他们派代表来北京具体商谈，但至今仍没有实现。
    问：交换物资时运输问题怎样解决呢？
    答：运输问题中主要的是船舶使用问题，我与高良富、帆足计、宫腰喜助三位先生进行谈判时，就有过可以考虑使用日船，并可直接到中国港口靠岸的初步谅解，但关于日船靠岸港口，入港手续及其他有关航行等具体问题，必需双方当面协商方能解决。
    问：付款问题怎么办呢？
    答：原则上是以货易货，但其付款方式可以灵活处理，除直接货易的方式外，通过第三国银行互开信用状也不失为一种办法。将来双方当面协商时，如有更合适的方法，也可考虑采用。
    问：交易物资的价格怎样决定？
    答：价格问题，将来双方具体商谈时，可本着公平合理的原则调整之。
    总之，所有有关交易上的具体技术问题，必需双方当面磋商，方能圆满解决。
