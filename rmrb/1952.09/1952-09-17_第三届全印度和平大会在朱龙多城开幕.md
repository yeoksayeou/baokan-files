Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 14th: The Third All-India Peace Congress opened on the 12th in Jullundur, East Punjab Province. The congress is scheduled to last for three days. This congress is a great demonstration of the power of the Indian people's peace movement.

Under the chairmanship of a presidium headed by Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, the congress was declared open by the prominent economist Dr. Kumarappa.

Early in the morning of the 12th, farmers from all over East Punjab Province flocked to attend the congress. The opening meeting was attended by 350 delegates from all over India, as well as 3,000 peace-loving people from East Punjab Province.

In his speech, Dr. Kumarappa analyzed in detail the peace policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. He used many practical examples to illustrate how the peace policies have benefited the people of these two countries. At the same time, he emphasized that the war policy of American imperialism, which has already been proven in Korea and elsewhere, is dragging the world toward destruction. He pointed out how war causes poverty and economic collapse, and explained how happiness and prosperity can arise under peaceful conditions.

Amid cheers, the famous novelist Dr. Anand hung up the banner presented by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace to the All-India Cultural Conference and Festival for Peace (held in Calcutta from April 1st to 6th this year). The delegates all stood up and applauded continuously to welcome it. Anand said that this was a gift expressing the friendship of the Chinese people. He told the delegates that the Indian delegation attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference would also bring gifts to their Chinese brothers.

After the congress read out the congratulatory message from the Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, it read out the congratulatory message from Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and the audience burst into warm applause. The congress also received congratulatory messages from the All-Pakistan Peace Committee and local peace committees from all over India, famous writers, poets, members of parliament, religious leaders, business people, and others.

Among those who spoke at the congress were: General Auley, member of the Central Province Legislative Assembly and leader of the Peasants and Workers People's Party; Saksena, a member of the Indian trade union delegation who was invited to visit China in May; and Sahai, former Secretary of the Northern Province Government.

In his speech, the chairman of the congress, Dr. Kitchlew, called on the participants not to be deceived by the lies and propaganda of the enemies of peace; he reminded everyone to be wary of all kinds of vicious propaganda that slandered the peace movement. He said that the various Indian delegations that visited the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had personally seen the great peace activities of these countries, and had no doubt about the sincerity of the Soviet and Chinese people in striving for peace. He said: "Let us judge the path of justice and truth for ourselves, and not be deceived by the propaganda lies of the United States." Finally, he mentioned the peace conference to be held in Beijing by representatives of peace-loving people from Asian and Pacific countries. He said: "If Asian countries unite, if India and China and other Asian countries join hands in this movement for peace, we can prevent war. Peace will be ours."

The Third All-India Peace Congress was held in a large camp in the center of Jullundur, decorated with many slogans and festoons. The festoons hanging on the horizontal bars read: "Peace can save; peace must save!" Below it was a large white dove of peace on a blue background. There were also slogans such as "War-mongers get out of Asia."

Jullundur is one of the places in India where the most signatures have been collected for the declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

    第三届全印度和平大会在朱龙多城开幕
    【新华社新德里十四日电】第三届全印度和平大会于十二日在东旁遮普省朱龙多城开幕。大会预定举行三天。这次大会是印度人民和平运动力量的大示威。
    大会在以全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士为首的主席团主持下，由著名经济学家库玛拉巴博士宣告开幕。
    十二日一清早，来自东旁遮普省各地的农民即络绎前往参加大会。参加开幕会议的代表有印度各地的代表三百五十人，以及东旁遮普省爱好和平的人士三千人。
    库玛拉巴博士在致词中详细分析了苏联和中华人民共和国的和平政策。他以许多实际例子来说明和平政策如何使这两国人民获得了好处。同时他着重指出，已经在朝鲜及其他地方证明了的美帝国主义的战争政策，则正把世界拖向毁灭的境地。他指出战争如何造成贫困和经济崩溃，并说明在和平条件下如何会产生幸福和繁荣。
    著名小说家安纳德博士在欢呼声中挂起了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会送给全印文化界和平会议与联欢大会（今年四月一日至六日在加尔各答举行）的锦旗。代表们全体起立以不断的掌声表示欢迎。安纳德说，这是中国人民表示友爱的礼物。他告诉代表们说，参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的印度代表团也将携带礼物献给他们的中国弟兄们。
    大会在宣读了世界和平理事会秘书长的贺电后，宣读中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若的贺电，全场报以热烈的掌声。大会还收到全巴基斯坦和平委员会以及印度各地和平委员会、著名作家、诗人、国会议员、宗教领袖、商界人士等给大会的贺电。
    在大会上发表演说的有：中央省立法会议议员及农工人民党领袖艾乌理将军、在五月间应邀到中国访问的印度工会代表团团员萨克森纳以及前北方省政府政务秘书萨海。
    大会主席克其鲁博士在发言中号召参加大会的人不要被和平敌人的谎言宣传所欺骗；他提醒大家提防各种诬蔑和平运动的恶毒宣传。他说，访问苏联和中华人民共和国的各印度代表团已亲自看到了这些国家的伟大和平活动，而对苏联和中国人民争取和平的诚意，毫无怀疑。他说：“让我们自己来判断公正和真理的道路，而不要被美国的宣传谎言所欺骗。”最后他提到亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平的人民代表即将在北京举行的和平会议。他说：“假如亚洲各国团结起来，假如印度和中国及其他亚洲国家在这个争取和平的运动中携起手来，我们就能够阻止战争。和平将是我们的。”
    第三届全印和平大会是在朱龙多城中心的一个大营场中举行的，营场内以许多标语和花彩装饰起来。挂在横条上的花彩写道：“和平可以拯救；和平必须拯救！”在它下面是蓝地白色的大和平鸽。另外还有“战争贩子滚出亚洲”等标语。
    朱龙多城是全印度征集要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言签名最多的一个地方。
