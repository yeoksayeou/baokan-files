    Learning from the Study Spirit of an Honorary Soldier
    Comrade Editor: Bai Mingjiang is an honorary soldier who originally didn't know a single character, but through continuous learning, he has now become a teacher at Zepan Village Elementary School in Longyao County.

    At first glance, some people might find it strange and think it's impossible. No, not at all strange, it's a fact. The reason why Comrade Bai Mingjiang has progressed so quickly is because there is a force supporting him: he wants to always maintain the glorious title of "the most beloved person" given to him by the people.

    He is not clever. When he was learning to read, he progressed slowly and forgot things quickly. He often had to be taught a character two or three times. Some classmates laughed at him: "The state gives you two thousand catties of millet every year, you can't finish it even if you sit and eat it, why bother racking your brains? You can't recognize five characters a day, you won't become an elementary school teacher even when 'iron trees bloom'!" But he resolutely replied to them: "Is learning culture more difficult than fighting a war? I can't eat for nothing the millet that the people exchanged with their blood and sweat, I can't forget Chairman Mao's kindness, as long as I live, I must work for the motherland and the people every day." His determination was as strong as steel.

    Comrade Bai Mingjiang has a spirit of self-sacrifice. He knows what he is learning for, so he can study diligently. With the enthusiastic help of the teachers, after three months of study, he was able to understand general publications and newspapers. But he did encounter difficulties in his studies, many difficulties, but when he thought of the motherland needing him, he forgot that he was disabled. He didn't even bother to eat or wash his face, and insisted on studying culture every day, wishing he could swallow the books all at once.

    During his teaching internship at the village elementary school this summer, Comrade Bai Mingjiang received high praise from the teachers, who all said that his teaching methods were good. But he was not proud and complacent, and humbly learned from other teachers. He said: "I must teach the next generation well and contribute all my strength to building a beautiful motherland!"　　　　　　　　　Wang Qingzhou

### 学习一个荣誉军人的学习精神

    学习一个荣誉军人的学习精神
    编辑同志：白明江同志是一位荣誉军人，原来一个大字也不识，可是经过不断地学习，他现在已经成为隆尧县泽畔村小学的教师了。
    乍一听，有人可能觉得奇怪，认为这是不可能的。不，一点也不奇怪，这是事实。白明江同志所以进步这样快，原因是有一种力量在支持着他：他要永远保持人民给他的“最可爱的人”的光荣称号。
    他并不聪明，他学认字的时候，进度很慢，并且忘的很快，一个字往往要教两三遍。有的同学笑他：“国家每年给你两千斤小米，坐着吃也吃不完，何必费脑筋。你一天不能认五个字，等到‘铁树开了花’也不能当个小学教员！”但他毅然回答他们：“难道学文化比打仗还难吗？我决不能白吃人民用血汗换来的小米，我忘不了毛主席的恩情，我活一天就得为祖国、人民工作一天。”他的决心坚强如钢。
    白明江同志具有自我牺牲的精神，他知道学习是为的什么，所以在学习的时候，他能用心钻研。在老师的热心帮助下，经过三个月的学习，他便能看懂一般的刊物和报纸。但在学习中他不是没有遇到过困难的，他遇到的困难很多，可是他想起祖国需要他，就忘掉了自己是个残废人，他饭都顾不得吃，脸都顾不得洗，天天坚持学文化，恨不得一下子把书本吞进肚里。
    今年暑假，白明江同志在本村小学进行教学实习时，得到老师们的好评，都说他的教学方法好。但他并不骄傲自满，虚心地向别的老师学习。他说：“我一定要把下一代教好，为建设美好的祖国贡献出我所有的力量！”　　　　　　　　　王清洲
