Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 25th (TASS dispatch): The National Committee of the American Progressive Party has published a resolution passed at its recent meeting in Philadelphia. The resolution states: "The American people face a grave crisis in the Korean War. There are indications that the Pentagon, instead of concluding an armistice agreement to end the killing in Korea as the American people demand, is, with the consent of Republican and Democratic leaders, intensifying and prolonging the war. The Pentagon has already begun to intensify the bombing of civilian power generation facilities on the Manchurian border, inviting the risk of escalating the war." The resolution points out that Eisenhower and Stevenson dare not talk about ending the senseless Korean War, which has caused heavy casualties to the United States. Neither party's candidate has honestly explained the real facts to the American people—neither candidate has answered the question that is most important in the minds of the American people: how to end the war immediately?

The resolution emphasizes that ending the Korean War is the single most important issue facing the American people. The American people have already expressed their demand to end the war. They must be awakened to make this demand directly, resolutely, and forcefully to both party candidates and the President of the United States.

The Progressive Party National Committee also issued a statement calling on the American people to be more vigilant during the election period in defending their democratic rights, which are increasingly threatened by "McCarthyism" and the "anti-communist movement." The statement points out that the Nixon scandal shows how the "anti-communist movement" is being used to cover up corruption and prevent the discussion of real issues in the election.

The statement emphasizes that the American people must make the "most important decision" in this election. It warns that deceptive anti-communist rhetoric is being used more and more to intimidate voters who demand an end to the Korean War, a reduction in the staggering burden of arms expansion and heavy taxes, full equality for blacks and whites, and the implementation of price and rent controls, etc. The statement calls on the American people to join the Progressive Party in defending the right to fully discuss election issues. It calls for organizing a "real crusade to eliminate McCarthyism" and calls on the American people to vote for the Progressive Party, as it is the best guarantee for the restoration of the Bill of Rights.

    美国进步党全国委员会通过决议
    动员美国人民要求结束侵朝战争
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：美国进步党全国委员会发表了最近在费城举行会议时通过的决议。这个决议说：“美国人民面对着朝鲜战争中的严重危机。有各种迹象表明：五角大楼不但不像美国人民所要求的那样，缔结停战协定以结束在朝鲜的杀戮，反而在共和党与民主党领袖的同意下加紧进行并且延长这个战争。五角大楼已经开始加紧轰炸满洲边界上的民用发电设备，招致了战争扩大的危机。”决议指出：艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森都不敢谈到结束这场已使美国遭受重大伤亡的无意义的朝鲜战争。两党候选人都没有向美国人民诚实地说明真正的事实——两党候选人都没有答复在美国人民心目中占最重要地位的问题：怎样马上结束战争？
    决议着重指出：结束朝鲜战争是美国人民面前唯一最重要的问题。美国人民已经表示过他们要求结束战争。必须唤起他们直接地、坚决有力地向两党候选人和美国总统提出这种要求。
    进步党全国委员会另外还发表了一项声明，号召美国人民在竞选期间更加警觉地保卫他们日益遭到“麦克锡主义”和“反共运动”威胁的民主权利。声明指出：尼克松丑闻说明“反共运动”怎样被用来掩饰贪污和阻止在竞选中讨论真正的问题。
    声明强调说：美国人民在这次选举中必须作出“最重大的决定”。它警告说：骗人的反共叫嚣正在日甚一日地被用来恫吓那些要求结束朝鲜战争、减轻扩张军备的惊人负担和重税、给予黑人和白人完全平等的权利、实施物价与房租管制等等的选民。声明号召美国人民和进步党一道保卫充分讨论竞选问题的权利。它号召组织“真正的十字军来消灭麦克锡主义”，并号召美国人民投进步党的票，因为它是恢复权利法案的最好的保证。
