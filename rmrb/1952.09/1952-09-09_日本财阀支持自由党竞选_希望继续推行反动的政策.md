Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The Japanese Zaibatsu groups are secretly and actively supporting the Liberal Party, the enemy of the Japanese people, in the general election. They hope that the Liberal Party will continue to be in power and continue to pursue reactionary policies as before in order to safeguard the interests of the Zaibatsu groups.

According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Zaibatsu hope to produce "a conservative regime that draws a clear line with the Communist Party" in the general election. And the members of the conservative regime in their minds are the ruling Liberal Party. Kyodo News said that "reliable sources" revealed on the 2nd that "a group of Japanese big business representatives" are "secretly active behind the political scene." They "guarantee to fully support the Liberal Party in the upcoming general election" and "promise to financially support the Liberal Party so that the Japanese Communist Party cannot succeed." Former Minister of Finance and a key figure in the Liberal Party's Ichiro Hatoyama group, Tanzan Ishibashi, has requested the Japanese Zaibatsu group to "donate" 150 million yen to the Liberal Party as "election funds," and "these Japanese entrepreneurs have unanimously agreed to give the Liberal Party their full support." At the same time, the Zaibatsu groups are also exerting pressure on the Liberal Party through "financial assistance," urging the Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama groups within the Liberal Party to take a consistent step in the general election in order to avoid weakening the Liberal Party's strength. The above-mentioned "reliable sources" said that "these big entrepreneurs have another condition for agreeing to provide financial assistance, that is, the Liberal Party must bridge the gap between the Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama factions in order to win votes nationwide."

Kyodo News revealed that the purpose of the Zaibatsu groups' "full support" for the Liberal Party in the general election is to enable the Liberal Party to "regain power and stabilize the political situation" and "maintain the economic status quo." This means continuing to be subordinate to American capital externally, and internally suppressing the people and destroying peaceful industry. What the Japanese Zaibatsu hope from the Liberal Party is to continue to maintain such a situation that violates the interests of the Japanese people.

Kyodo News also revealed that the group of Japanese big business representatives who are conducting behind-the-scenes transactions with the Liberal Party consists of twenty people, including Tadashi Kobayashi, president of the Japan Development Bank, Shimpo Asao, president of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and Yaichi Sasaki, president of Nippon Oil Company, which has close ties with the American Texaco. In fact, one of the main sources of funds for the Liberal Party in the past was the "donations" from the enterprises operated by these Zaibatsu group figures. For example, according to the figures disclosed by the Liberal Party alone, Nippon Yusen Kaisha had "donated" 500,000 yen to the Liberal Party in the one year from May last year to April this year.

    日本财阀支持自由党竞选
    希望继续推行反动的政策
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：日本的财阀集团正在秘密地积极支持日本人民之敌自由党进行大选。他们希望自由党继续执政，照旧推行反动政策，以保障财阀集团的利益。
    据共同社透露，日本财阀希望在大选中产生“一个和共产党划清界限的保守政权”。而他们心目中的保守政权的组成者就是现在执政的自由党。共同社说，“可靠人士”二日透露，“一群日本大企业家代表”正在“政治舞台幕后秘密活动”。他们“保证在即将举行的大选中全力支持自由党”，并“答应在财政上支持自由党，以使日本共产党不能得逞”。前藏相（财政大臣）、自由党鸠山一郎集团的主要人物石桥湛山已向日本财阀集团提出向自由党“捐献”一亿五千万日元的“竞选基金”的要求，“这些日本企业家表示一致同意给自由党以全力支持”。同时，财阀集团也正以“财政援助”为手段，对自由党施行压力，促使自由党内部吉田和鸠山一郎这两个集团在大选中采取一致的步调，以避免削弱自由党的力量。上述“可靠人士”说，“这些大企业家答应给予财政援助还有一个条件，那就是自由党必须弥补吉田和鸠山一郎两派间的裂痕，以争取全国的选票”。
    共同社透露，财阀集团在大选中“全力支持”自由党的目的在于使自由党“再握政权，稳定政局”。并“维持经济现状”。这就是继续对外从属于美国资本，对内是镇压人民，摧毁和平工业。日本财阀所希望于自由党的，就是继续维持这样的违反日本人民利益的局面。
    共同社又透露，这群正与自由党进行幕后交易的日本大企业家的代表有二十个人，包括日本开发银行总裁小林中、日本邮船会社社长浅尾新甫以及与美国德士古公司有密切关系的日本石油会社社长佐佐木弥市。事实上，过去自由党的主要经费来源之一就是这些财阀集团人物所经营的企业的“捐款”。例如，仅根据自由党所公开的数字，日本邮船会社在从去年五月到今年四月的一年间，就曾“捐”给自由党五十万日元。
