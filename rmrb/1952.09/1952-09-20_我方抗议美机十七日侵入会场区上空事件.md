Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 18th. The American side has continuously created incidents that undermine the agreement on the joint conference area. At 9:45 AM on September 17th, an American military aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area. Our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, lodged a protest with the other side's chief liaison officer at the liaison officers' meeting on the 18th regarding this matter.

On the same day that the American plane flew over the conference area, the other side's chief liaison officer, McCarthy, sent a letter to our chief liaison officer, admitting the enemy's hostile act of distributing slanderous leaflets within the conference area on September 14th, in violation of the agreement, and also stated: "All possible measures will be taken to ensure that it does not happen again." However, just over an hour before McCarthy's letter reached our side, the American side created another incident of an American plane violating the agreement. Although McCarthy was forced to admit the violation of the agreement by distributing leaflets, he flatly denied the provocation by the American military police in attempting to hand over these leaflets to our military police, even though this incident had been jointly investigated by the liaison officers of both sides on September 15th and was unanimously confirmed by eyewitnesses at the time. Now, the American side admits to violating the conference area agreement on the one hand, and on the other hand, it undermines this agreement. Colonel Zhang Chunshan seriously pointed out to the other side: "This clearly shows that you are unwilling to abide by the conference area agreement and do not want to maintain order in this area."

As the time for the armistice negotiation meeting decreases, the number of incidents in which the American side violates the conference area agreement is increasing. On August 2nd, the American side shelled the conference area. On August 4th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 16th, and September 17th, American planes intruded into the airspace over the conference area six times. On September 14th, the American side distributed leaflets within the conference area, and its military police openly engaged in provocations. In addition, the American side is increasingly frequently using the conference area as a passage for sending special agents back and forth. The American side's arbitrary acts of undermining the conference area agreement are obviously a despicable means of deliberately sabotaging the armistice negotiations.

### 我方抗议美机十七日侵入会场区上空事件

    我方抗议美机十七日侵入会场区上空事件
    【新华社开城十八日电】美方连续制造破坏双方会场区协议的事件，九月十七日上午九时四十五分，美方军用飞机又侵入板门店会场区上空。我方首席联络官张春山上校已在十八日双方联络官会议上，就此事向对方首席联络官提出抗议。
    在美机飞越会场区的当天，对方首席联络官麦卡塞致函我方首席联络官，承认九月十四日在会场区内投发诬蔑性传单的违反协议的敌对行为，并且又声言：“将采取一切可能的措施以保证不再重复。”但是，就在麦卡塞来函送达我方以前的一小时多，美方又制造了美机违反协议的事件。麦卡塞虽然被迫承认投发传单的违反协议行为，但对美方军事警察企图把此项传单交给我方军事警察的挑衅却矢口抵赖，虽然此一事件在九月十五日已经双方联络官共同调查，并为当时人证所一致证实。现在美方一面承认违反会场区协议，同时又破坏这个协议。张春山上校向对方严重指出：“这明白地表示你们不愿遵守会场区协议，也不想维持这一区域的秩序。”
    在停战谈判会议开会时间越来越少的同时，美方破坏会场区协议的事件却愈来愈多。八月二日美方炮击会场区。八月四日、十日、十一日、十二日、十六日、九月十七日美机六次侵入会场区上空。九月十四日，美方在会场区内投发传单，其军事警察公然进行挑衅。此外，美方更愈来愈频繁地把会场区用为派遣特务的来往通道。美方这种恣意破坏会场区协议的行为，显然是其蓄意破坏停战谈判的一个卑劣手段。
