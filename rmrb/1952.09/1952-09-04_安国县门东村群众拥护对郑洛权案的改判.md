Reader's Letters:

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published a report on August 27th, on page three, titled "Hebei Provincial People's Court Handled Cases Irresponsibly, Lending a Credulous Ear to One Side, Wrongly Sentencing Zheng Luoquan and Five Others to Death and Long-Term Imprisonment; Thorough Investigation by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and Relevant Agencies Has Now Corrected This." This case has had a significant impact on the people of Mentong Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province. After Zheng Luoquan and the other five were wrongly sentenced, villagers thought: "Those with power and influence can get things done; common people suffer." They harbored doubts about the People's Government. Upon receiving instructions from the higher court, the Hebei Provincial People's Court convened a mass meeting in Mentong Village on August 11th, announcing the reversal of the sentences of Zheng Luoquan and the other five, releasing them without charge. Zheng Yi was sentenced to three years imprisonment for malicious accusation. As a result, the villagers immediately dispelled their doubts about the People's Government and generally expressed: (1) Support for the correct investigation of the case by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and the investigation team composed of relevant district and county officials. They believed this investigation was comprehensive and impartial. (2) Fully support the decision to reverse the sentences. They thought, "This is a great solution. We are all old neighbors who will not be separated for centuries, and from now on, we can all focus on production." (3) They felt the warmth of the Communist Party and the People's Government and became ideologically closer to the Communist Party and the People's Government. Everyone said, "Chairman Mao leads well, truly selfless. No matter what level of government worker you are, you cannot get away with anything unreasonable."

    安国县门东村群众拥护对郑洛权案的改判
    编辑同志：八月二十七日人民日报第三版刊载了“河北省人民法院处理案件不负责任偏听偏信，错判郑洛权等六人死刑和长期徒刑，经最高人民检察署等有关机关深入调查现已纠正”的报道。这一案件，在河北省安国县门东村群众中影响很大。郑洛权等六人被错判后，村中群众认为：“有权有势能办事，傻老百姓吃不开。”对人民政府抱怀疑态度。河北省人民法院接到上级法院的指示，于八月十一日在门东村召开群众大会，宣布改判郑洛权等六人无罪释放，郑义因挟嫌诬告，判处其三年徒刑。这样，该村群众立即消除了对人民政府的怀疑，并普遍表示：（一）拥护中央人民政府最高人民检察署、河北省人民政府和有关专区、县、区工作人员组成的调查组对该案所作的正确调查。认为这次调查是全面的、公正的。（二）完全拥护改判的决定。认为，“这样解决太好了。大家都是百年不散的老乡亲，从今以后都可以好好生产啦。”（三）感到共产党和人民政府的温暖，从思想上靠近了共产党和人民政府。都说，“毛主席领导得好，真是大公无私。不管你是那一级的政府工作人员，无理便寸步难行。”
