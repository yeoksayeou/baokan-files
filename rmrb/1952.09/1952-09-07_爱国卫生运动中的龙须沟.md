Longxu Ditch before liberation was a notorious stinking ditch in Beijing. It severely damaged the health of nearby residents and sometimes even directly took their lives. In May 1950, in accordance with the principle of municipal construction serving the working people, the Beijing Municipal People's Government converted the upper section of Longxu Ditch into a culvert, built a wide road over the ditch, and dredged the lower section, fundamentally changing the environmental sanitation of the area's residents. In October 1951, the People's Government rebuilt the nearby Jin Yu (Gold Fish) Pond, turning it into a beautiful small garden. This spring, the People's Government issued a call to launch a patriotic health campaign, which was immediately met with enthusiastic response from the masses in Longxu Ditch. They all said, "The People's Government cares about our hygiene, repairing Longxu Ditch and building Jin Yu Pond. If we don't get up and do a good job in cleaning and sanitation ourselves, how can we be worthy of the government?" Driven by the masses' feelings, the patriotic health campaign in Longxu Ditch was launched enthusiastically. Almost every street has a health committee, and every ten households have a health group, stipulating that hygiene be inspected three times a week. They built a rain drain in Beitan'gen, solving the problem of water accumulation on the street. In the past, both sides of the hutongs were piled with garbage, but now they have been cleaned up. Even the most remote and smallest hutongs have no garbage at all. Skin baskets have been installed in the hutongs; toilets are emptied once a day, lime is sprinkled every day, and "666" is applied regularly. There are no maggots or flies in the cesspools. The very dirty ice cellar near Jin Yu Pond has now been filled with soil and is being prepared for construction into a ball field.

The People's Government has also installed tap water pipes in Longxu Ditch, and the residents' drinking water problem has also been solved. Now they drink clean and hygienic tap water, so they rarely get stomach diseases, and other diseases have also been greatly reduced. If anyone gets sick, the police station will introduce him to the health station for free treatment. "666" is sprayed within 50 meters of the patient's house for disinfection. When I visited health committee member Zhao Junqing, she said with a beaming smile, "Our environment is very different from before. Now, after a day's work, we can comfortably drink tea and enjoy the cool in the yard, and we can also turn on the lights to study culture at night." Xu Shiying, a sanitation activist who sells goldfish, told me with great interest, "In the past, we worked all day and were exhausted, but we couldn't sleep at night and had to guard the goldfish all night, fearing that rats would steal them. Now that the rats have been almost eliminated, we can have a good sleep after a happy day's work."

However, they have not forgotten the poor conditions of the past. As soon as they talked about Longxu Ditch before liberation, they immediately put away their smiles. At that time, Longxu Ditch was full of rotten mud, mixed with garbage, dead rats, dead cats, dead dogs, dead babies, and feces. The water color was like indigo in a dyeing vat, and the surface was floating with large sauce-colored bubbles. Nearby residents had to cover their noses to live. When it rained, rainwater from the outer city of Beijing flowed into Longxu Ditch, and the ditch water overflowed, creating a vast expanse of water. The local working people were often awakened in the middle of the night by the stinking water that flooded the kang (platform bed). The Kuomintang reactionaries regarded "ditch repair" as a "lucrative post," only caring about collecting fees but not caring about the life and death of the residents. The stinking ditch was still a stinking ditch, a breeding ground for mosquitoes, flies, and rats. The ditch and Jin Yu Pond were full of maggots more than an inch long. Because the ditch bank was higher than the window sills of the working people, the maggots often crawled into the houses from the windows, even into the quilts on the kang, and onto the vegetables of the vegetable sellers. Before the sun came out, the working people were awakened by the buzzing of flies. When cooking, as soon as the pot lid was lifted, the flies were scalded to death by the emerging steam and fell into the pot. They drank the stinking water from Longxu Ditch, which was pumped out by a water pump, which was both astringent and bitter. It was very easy to get acute gastroenteritis after drinking it. Coupled with the attacks of flies, mosquitoes, and rats, the Longxu Ditch area became a breeding ground for various infectious diseases. During epidemics, the whole family often died overnight...

But now, this life of suffering is gone forever. Before or after a day's work, groups of working people go to Jin Yu Pond to stroll and look into the distance at the Temple of Heaven buildings reflecting the rising or setting sun. Close to the east and south sides of Jin Yu Pond, there are two wide avenues, and large trucks pass by here in an endless stream. Under these two avenues is the Longxu Ditch, which stank before liberation.

    爱国卫生运动中的龙须沟
    彭家杰
    解放前的龙须沟是北京有名的臭沟，它严重地损害着附近居民的健康，有时甚至直接夺去居民的生命。一九五○年五月，北京市人民政府根据市政建设为劳动人民服务的方针，把龙须沟上段改建为暗沟，沟上修了宽阔的马路，下段则加以疏浚，基本改变了这一带居民的环境卫生的状况。一九五一年十月，人民政府又重新修建了附近的金鱼池，使它成为美丽的小花园。今年春天，人民政府发出开展爱国卫生运动的号召，马上得到龙须沟群众的热烈响应。他们都说：“人民政府关怀我们的清洁卫生，修龙须沟，修建金鱼池，我们自己再不起来做好清洁卫生工作，对得住政府吗？”在群众的这样思想感情的推动下，龙须沟的爱国卫生运动，便热烈地开展起来了。差不多每条街都有一个卫生委员会，每十户有一个卫生小组，规定每星期检查卫生三次。他们在北坛根修了一个雨水口，解决了街上积水的问题。过去胡同里两边都堆满了垃圾，现在都给打扫得干干净净了。就是最偏僻、最小的胡同，也没有一点垃圾了。胡同里都安装了皮壳筐；厕所一天掏一次，天天撒石灰，定期打“六六六”。粪坑里没有粪蛆，没有苍蝇。金鱼池左近那个非常肮脏的冰窖，现已用土填平，准备把它修建为一个球场。
    人民政府又在龙须沟安置了自来水管，居民的吃水问题也解决了。现在他们吃的是清洁卫生的自来水，因此很少人生肠胃病了，其他疾病也大大减少；谁有了病，派出所就介绍他到保健站去免费治疗；病人家附近五十公尺以内都喷射“六六六”，进行消毒。当我访问卫生委员赵俊卿的时候，她眉欢眼笑地说：“我们的环境和以前大不相同了。现在一天工作完了，我们可以在院子里舒舒服服地喝茶乘凉，晚上也可以扭开电灯学习文化。”卖金鱼的卫生积极分子徐世英，兴致勃勃地告诉我：“过去我们工作一天，累得要命，但是晚上不能睡，终夜都得守护着金鱼，怕老鼠偷吃；现在老鼠打得差不多了，一天愉快劳动之后，可以睡个很香的觉了。”
    然而他们并没有忘记过去的恶劣情况。一谈起解放前的龙须沟，他们马上收起了笑容。那时候，龙须沟全是烂泥浆，夹杂着垃圾、死老鼠、死猫、死狗、死婴和粪便，水色像染缸里的蓝靛一样，水面漂浮着酱色的大泡沫。附近的居民都得掩着鼻子过日子。下雨时，北京外城的雨水都流到龙须沟来，沟水四溢，一片汪洋。当地的劳动人民，往往半夜里为漫上炕头的臭水所惊醒。国民党反动派把“修沟”当作“肥缺”，只管收费，却不管居民的死活。臭水沟始终还是臭水沟，是繁殖蚊子、苍蝇、老鼠的大温床，沟里和金鱼池里漂满了一寸多长的大尾巴蛆，因为沟堤比劳动人民的窗台还要高，大尾巴蛆常常从窗口爬进房子，甚至爬进炕上的被窝里，爬到卖菜人家的菜上。太阳还没有出来，劳动人民就被苍蝇的嗡嗡声所轰醒。烧饭的时候，一揭开锅盖，苍蝇被冒出的蒸气烫死，纷纷落进锅里。他们吃的是压水机压出来的龙须沟里的臭水，又涩又苦，吃了下去，非常容易得急性肠胃炎病。再加上苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠的袭击，龙须沟一带就成了种种传染病的发祥地，在疫病流行的时候，往往一夜之间，全家人都死亡。……
    可是现在，这种苦难的生活是一去不复返了。在一天的工作开始以前或结束以后，成群的劳动人民就到金鱼池旁边蹓跶、凭栏远眺那映照着朝阳或落日的天坛建筑物。紧靠着金鱼池的东边和南边，有着两条康庄的大道，大车络绎不绝地打这儿经过。在这两条大道的底下，就是解放前臭气薰天的龙须沟。
