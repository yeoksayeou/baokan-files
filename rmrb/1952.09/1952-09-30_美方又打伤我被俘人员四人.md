Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 29th. The U.S. side announced that on the 26th, they again injured four of our captured personnel on Jeju Island. This time, the excuse was that the prisoners of war "refused to obey orders." The U.S. side is unwilling to reveal what kind of "orders" they wanted the prisoners of war to obey; however, this evasive attitude is enough to show that these so-called "orders" are shameful. Recently, atrocities of killing and wounding prisoners of war have been happening every day on Jeju Island, proving that the U.S. side is intensifying its use of bayonets and instruments of torture to "order" the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to accept the fate of being forcibly detained. Recently, American officials and American newspapers have repeatedly advocated using the Kuomintang bandit troops in Korea, which has exposed the U.S. side's conspiracy to detain prisoners of war as cannon fodder even more thoroughly.

    美方又打伤我被俘人员四人
    【新华社开城二十九日电】美方宣布二十六日又在济州岛上打伤我方被俘人员四人，这次的借口是战俘“拒绝服从命令”。美方不肯透露他们要战俘服从的是什么样的“命令”；但是这种遮遮掩掩的态度，已经足以说明这种所谓“命令”是见不得人的。最近济州岛上每天都发生打死打伤战俘的暴行，证明美方正在加紧用刺刀和刑具“命令”中国人民志愿军的被俘人员接受被迫扣留的命运。最近美国官方和美国报纸一再鼓吹要在朝鲜使用国民党匪帮军队，这就使美方扣留战俘充当炮灰的阴谋暴露得更加彻底了。
