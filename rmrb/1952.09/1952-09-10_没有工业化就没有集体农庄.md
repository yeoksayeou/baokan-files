Without Industrialization, There Would Be No Collective Farms
    
    When Yang Xianting (agricultural labor model of Heilongjiang Province, director of agricultural production cooperative), a representative of the Chinese farmers' delegation to the Soviet Union, spoke with us, he recalled: In 1950, they borrowed a set of horse-drawn agricultural implements from the government, and everyone was overjoyed. In the past, one laborer could only cultivate four hectares (hectares) of land, but with horse-drawn agricultural implements, they could cultivate eight hectares. In the past, people pulled iron wire "rakes" to rake grass, which strained their shoulders and could only rake one cart a day. With a horse-drawn hay rake, people could sit on it and rake one cart in no time; when it was full, they could step on it and the grass would fall down. Old Zhou, who was over sixty years old, stared blankly and said happily: "I've carried heavy loads all my life and been a beast of burden all my life; with Chairman Mao's leadership, people and horses are separated!" "However, after seeing the Soviet Union this time, wow! We are far behind! Soviet tractors pulling hay rakes can rake 120 hectares a day, which would take 200 people with manual labor. If people want to be truly separated from horses, only industrialization can do it." Yang Xianting spoke with great fascination about the scene they saw when they visited the Kharkov Tractor Factory in the Soviet Union: "At one end of the factory, there was a pile of iron blocks; they were sent in piece by piece on a conveyor belt, and they changed their appearance after a while. At the other end of the factory, a 54-horsepower tractor came out every seven minutes, and someone immediately sat on it and drove it away." Jin Shilong (from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Northeast China, an excellent director of agricultural production cooperatives) also said in broken Chinese at this time: "The working class is truly great!" Yang Xianting continued: "This spring, our cooperative discussed making a five-year plan. Everyone said that we would buy a tractor in three years. Based on our cooperative's income, it would not be a big problem to buy a tractor by then. However, what if no one knows how to operate it? We didn't think of that at the time. We only saw our own cooperative and didn't see the whole country. After seeing the Soviet Union this time, in addition to collective farms buying their own tractors and having their own tractor drivers, there are also state tractor stations. One tractor station can supply many collective farms. They sign contracts with collective farms, and everyone works according to the contracts, working together to do the work very well. This is really a good way."

    Soviet Farmers Are Armed with Machines

    "Everything is done with machines!" The extensive mechanization of Soviet agriculture made the farmer representatives of the delegation praise it endlessly. Shi Rulin (farmer representative from Inner Mongolia) said: "Soviet farmers are farmers armed with machines." Soviet farmers rarely till the land directly by hand anymore. Workers created machines, and machines helped farmers become workers.

    Li Shunda said: "The first collective farm we visited, the 'October Revolution Victory' Collective Farm, had already achieved 100% mechanization of plowing, harrowing, sowing, harvesting, and threshing; and 85% mechanization of intertillage and weeding. In order to reduce the labor of the villagers, they also built a 400-kilowatt hydroelectric power station, and all the work of milking cows, feeding livestock, watering livestock, sawing wood, shearing sheep, grinding flour, extracting oil, making wine, and welding and repairing is done with electricity. The situation in all the collective farms in the Soviet Union is similar to that of this collective farm. The Soviet Union has mechanized 170 kinds of agricultural work, of which 150 kinds have been widely applied."

    Zhang Xuexiu (agricultural labor model of Pingyuan Province) said: "In the past, I also knew that machines could harvest wheat quickly, but I always thought: Will it be harvested cleanly? Will the wheat be lost? In the Soviet Union, we saw a Stalin No. 80 tractor with two combines, which could harvest 60 hectares a day (we can only harvest one mu a day with five people, including harvesting and threshing, and the land is not too far from the field), and no wheat is lost at all. After the wheat is harvested, it is immediately threshed into wheat grains, and filled into the 'warehouse' on the machine. When a car drives next to the machine, the wheat grains flow into the car and are pulled away. There are many large wheat straw stacks in the field, so high! How were they piled up? Also with machines. The machine pushes the small piles of wheat straw from the combine to the edge of the field and piles them up. After they are piled up to the height of one person, a machine that blows wind blows the wheat straw upwards from a tube, and two people stand on the wheat stack to receive it, and it is quickly piled up. The wheat is transported to the warehouse immediately after it is threshed, and it will not become moldy, because there is a machine to dry it. After the wheat is harvested, the land is immediately plowed; the wheat next to it is still growing well, and the plowed land a few feet away is ready. A Stalin No. 80 tractor with two five-share plows can plow 450 mu of land a day with two or three people. One person and two animals in our family can only plow three mu of land a day, which is incomparable." Li Neng (agricultural labor model of Yunnan Province) said: "I didn't know the power of mechanization in the past. The eight collective farms we visited this time cultivate an average of 17 hectares of land (255 mu) per laborer; in our area, one person can cultivate at most 20 or 30 mu of land. What a difference!" Yu Shanjiao (agricultural labor model of Hebei Province) said: "People sit on machines when harvesting wheat, with sheds above to shade the sun, so they don't get sunburned; the machine is running, and the wind is whistling, harvesting wheat and singing, and everyone is singing in the field; they even listen to the radio in the field during breaks. Labor has truly become a happy thing."

    Picking Cotton, Digging Sugar Beets, Transplanting Rice, and Planting Tobacco Are All Done with Machines

    Lian Cheng (farmer representative from Inner Mongolia) said: "In the past, I thought that the land was limited, and mechanization would use even fewer people, so would many people be unemployed? This question was also solved after the visit. Collective farms are developing a wide variety of production. They not only manage the land, but also manage many livestock and poultry, which cooperate with agriculture. For example, to implement a large-field crop rotation system with pasture, there must be animal husbandry." Zhang Xuexiu said: "Animal husbandry is also mechanized. When I first arrived in the Soviet Union, I heard that one person had to manage twelve dairy cows and milk them four times a day. How could they milk them without getting tired? When I saw it, it was milked by machines. Several tube-like things were placed on the cow's udder, and the milk dripped down 'plop, plop'." Mo Ri Ge Ce (agricultural labor model of Inner Mongolia) said: "The state-owned Lenin Farm has 75,000 sheep, and shearing is completely electrified. When we went, it was already past the shearing season. However, they had heard that Chinese farmer representatives were going to visit, so they left two or three hundred sheep unsheared. As soon as we arrived, they sheared them for us to see. In the past, one person could shear at most seven sheep a day, but now one person can shear eighty sheep in eight hours, and each sheep produces half a kilogram more wool than manual shearing."

    Li Shunda said: "We visited a machine for digging sugar beets. It was not yet time to harvest, but they also sacrificed a piece for us to see. The machine turned the sugar beets over, immediately cut off the leaves and put them aside, and put the beet roots on the other side. The machine digs potatoes very quickly. The machine digs down, comes up, the soil is thrown away, and the potatoes are put in one place, clean. The corn harvester harvests two rows at a time; the corn cobs are peeled and placed in one place, the stalks are crushed and discarded on the ground, and the land is plowed behind, so the crushed stalks are turned under the ground. If you want to keep the stalks to feed livestock, the machine crushes them and drops them on the ground in small piles, and then pulls them away in a cart. How do you pick cotton with a machine? We also saw it. It was not yet time to pick cotton, so they found some cotton wool and put it on the cotton plants; the machine walked through the field and could pick two rows at a time, using tube-like things to suck the cotton wool into the machine. The unopened cotton bolls are still growing well, and will not be touched or crushed. The sucked-in cotton will carry some dry leaves, and the machine will remove the leaves. After seeing it with my own eyes, I can no longer say that I don't believe it." Zhao Huaiyi (agricultural labor model of Henan Province) said: "The Soviet Union has also developed a method of artificial frost. When cotton has opened four or five bolls, it can be harvested for the first time. When harvesting, first 'frost' it to make all the leaves fall off, and then it is more convenient to harvest with a machine. After the first harvest, the unopened bolls continue to fluff, and it can be finished after another harvest. The Soviet Union is also studying to cultivate cotton varieties that mature at the same time in two stages, so that cotton does not fluff in succession, but fluffs at the same time in two stages. This makes it easier to harvest with a machine." We couldn't figure out how to harvest cotton with a machine in the past, because we were always thinking about how to adapt to the crops, instead of thinking about how to make the crops adapt to us.

    Zhao Huaiyi also said: "I only heard in the Soviet Union that rice can also be transplanted with a machine. I thought, some of the seedlings planted by hand still die, and the machine has no eyes, so will many of them die when they are planted? When I looked at the land, there were several women, one person sitting on a machine, transplanting rice effortlessly, twelve rows at a time. I picked one up and tried it, and it worked better than hand planting. One person can transplant nine hectares a day. The machine harvests rice, and one combine can harvest 50 hectares a day, which can harvest the rice from half of our township in one day. The rice fields are very wet, how does the machine get down there? They calculated accurately and drained the water 15 days in advance." Mo Ri Ge Ce said: "We watched tobacco being planted with a machine. There were seven people sitting on one machine, one person driving the machine and six people in charge of planting. The machine was running, digging holes, then automatically watering the holes, then automatically putting the seedlings in, sealing the soil, and then compacting the soil, which is much better than stepping on it with our feet, guaranteeing that 99% of the seedlings will survive, and it is very likely that 100% will survive."

    Using Airplanes to Kill Insects, Remove Weeds, and Fertilize

    Everyone was also very interested in using airplanes to serve agricultural production. Zhang Xuexiu said: "In the past, when I heard at home that the Soviet Union used airplanes to spray medicine to treat insects, I thought: How much medicine would it take? Flying so fast, would it just spray the land with insects? What if it sprayed on people? This time I saw how airplanes spray medicine. It sprays powder. First, put up big signs in the land with insects, and when the airplane flies to the place to be sprayed, it flies low, and it just sprays where it should. The airplane can also apply manure, mix the chemical fertilizer, load it on the airplane, and spread it on the ground with a machine, and then plow the land. This can be figured out. But people also said that airplanes can apply topdressing and remove weeds. I thought, how can that be done? It turns out that topdressing is a water fertilizer that is sprayed on the leaves, and the crops can absorb it; weeding is done with a medicine that is spread on the ground, which kills the weeds but does not kill the crops. It's amazing!" Zhang Desheng (farmer representative from the suburbs of Taiyuan) said: "People explained to us that the medicine is specially used to kill leguminous plants, but it does not kill gramineous plants. Many weeds, such as thorny buds and large bowl flowers, are leguminous plants, and spraying this medicine can kill them. If this medicine is sprayed on the land where soybeans, peas, and mung beans are planted, these leguminous crops will also die. Therefore, to use this scientific technology, collectivization is necessary. If, like in our land, your small plot is planted with wheat, and my small plot is planted with peas; your small plot is planted with millet, and my small plot is planted with mung beans, then there is no way to use airplanes to remove weeds." Li Shunda and Yu Shanjiao also said: Only collective production can use tractors and combines; to mechanize, you must collectivize; to collectivize, you must industrialize. Rao Xingli (farmer representative of Hubei Province) said: "In the past, we rarely saw industrial workers in our hometown, and we had never even seen machines in factories, let alone machines for farming. We only saw tailors in the town, and we thought that the working class was just like tailors. Can they lead us? This time I saw that workers can make so many and such big machines, and they have so much creativity, which reduces so much labor for farmers and increases so much output; I really realized that farmers really need to be led by the working class!"

    没有工业化就没有集体农庄
    燕凌
    中国农民代表赴苏参观团代表杨显亭（黑龙江省农业劳动模范，农业生产合作社主任）和我们谈话时，他回忆说：一九五○年他们从政府贷到了一套马拉机械农具，大家都高兴得不得了。过去一个劳动力只能种四垧（公顷）地，用了马拉机械农具以后就可以种八垧了。从前人拉着铁丝“爬子”搂草，把肩膀累得生痛，一天才能搂一车。有了马拉搂草机，人坐在上边，不一会就能搂一车；搂满了用脚一蹬，草就落下来了。六十多岁的周老头看着发了愣，高兴地说：“我扛了一辈子大活，当了一辈子牛马；有了毛主席领导，人和马算是分家了！”“可是，这次到苏联一看，嗬！我们还差得远！苏联的拖拉机拉的搂草机一天能搂一百二十公顷，用人工得二百人。人要和马真正分家，只有工业化才能办得到。”杨显亭非常神往地谈起他们在苏联参观哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂时看到的情景：“厂子这一头，是一堆铁块；用传送带往里面一段一段地送，过一段就变个样子。在工厂的那一头，每七分钟就出来一台五十四匹马力的拖拉机，有人立刻坐到上面，把它开走。”金时龙（东北延边朝鲜民族自治区人，优秀的农业生产合作社主任）这时也用不熟练的汉话说：“真是工人阶级伟大！”杨显亭接着说：“今年春天，我们合作社商量着订个五年计划。大家说，三年以后要买一台拖拉机。就我们合作社的收入来计算，到那时买一台拖拉机是不成大问题的。可是，没有人会摆弄怎么办？我们那时就没有想到。我们还是只看到自己的合作社，没看到整个国家。这回到苏联一看，除了集体农庄自己买有拖拉机，并有自己的拖拉机手以外，还有国家的拖拉机站。一个拖拉机站能供给好多个集体农庄使唤。他们和集体农庄订合同，大家按合同办事，同心合力把工作做得很好。这真是好办法。”
    苏联农民是用机器武装起来的
    “干什么也是用机器！”苏联农业机械化的广泛，使参观团的农民代表们赞不绝口。石汝麟（内蒙农民代表）说：“苏联农民是用机器武装起来的农民。”苏联农民已经很少用手直接耕作了。工人创造了机器，机器又帮助农民变成了工人。
    李顺达说：“我们参观的第一个集体农庄，‘十月革命胜利’集体农庄，耕地、耙地、播种、收割、脱粒，已经百分之百机械化了；中耕、除草百分之八十五机械化了。为了减少庄员的劳动，他们还建立了一个四百瓩的水力发电站，挤牛奶、喂牲口、饮牲口、锯木料、剪羊毛、磨面、榨油、造酒、焊修等工作，全都用电力来做。全苏联各农庄和这个农庄的情形都差不多。苏联已经有一百七十种农业工作机械化了，其中一百五十种已经普遍地应用。”
    张学修（平原省农业劳动模范）说：“过去我也知道机器割麦子割得快，可是，总想着：会不会割干净？掉麦不掉？在苏联我们看到一个斯大林八十号拖拉机带两个康拜因，一天能收六十公顷（我们连割带打，地离场不太远，五个人一天只能弄一亩），一点也不掉麦。麦割下来，就立即打成了麦粒，装满了机器上的‘仓’，汽车往机器旁边一开，让麦粒流到汽车里，就拉走了。地里有许多大麦秸垛，真高！怎么堆上去的呢？也是用机器。机器把康拜因上弄下来的一小堆一小堆麦秸推到地边上堆起来，堆了一人高以后，一个会打风的机器就把麦秸从一个筒筒里往上打，两个人站在麦垛上接，很快就堆起来了。麦子刚打下来就运到仓库里去，也不会发霉，有机器把它弄干。麦子收了，马上就犁地；旁边麦子还长得好好的，离几尺远割过的地就犁好了。一个斯大林八十号拖拉机带两个五铧犁，两三个人一天能犁四百五十亩地。我们家里一个人两个牲口一天才能犁三亩地，真是没法比。”李能（云南省农业劳动模范）说：“过去不知道机械化的力量，这次我们参观的八个农庄，平均每个劳动力管种十七公顷地（二百五十五亩）；我们那里一个人最多能种二、三十亩地。差到那儿去了！”郁善交（河北省农业劳动模范）说：“人家割麦时候坐在机器上，上面有棚子遮着太阳，晒不着；机器开着，风飕飕地刮着，割着麦子唱着歌，地里到处都在唱歌；休息时还在地里听收音机。劳动真变成了快乐的事。”
    摘棉花、刨甜菜、插秧、栽烟都用机器
    廉成（内蒙农民代表）说：“过去想，土地有限，机械化了用人更少，是不是许多人要失业呢？这问题在参观后也解决了。集体农庄是发展多种多样的生产的。不只经营土地，还经营很多家畜、家禽，和农业互相配合。比如要实行牧草大田轮作制，就得有畜牧业才行。”张学修说：“畜牧也是机械化的。才到苏联时听说一个人要管十二只奶牛，一天要挤四次奶，那可怎么挤法，不把人累坏了？一看，是用机器挤奶。几个像筒筒的东西往牛乳房上一罩，牛奶‘扑塌扑塌’就滴下来了。”莫日格策（内蒙农业劳动模范）说：“国营列宁农场有绵羊七万五千头，剪羊毛完全电气化了。我们去时本来已过了剪羊毛的季节。可是他们早听说中国农民代表要去参观，就留下了二三百只羊没剪，我们一到，就剪给我们看。过去一个人一天最多能剪七只，现在一个人八小时能剪八十只，而且比人工剪每一只羊要多出半公斤羊毛。”
    李顺达说：“我们参观了用机器刨甜菜。那时还不到收的时候，人家也是为了我们看，特别牺牲了一块。机器把甜菜翻起来，立即就把叶子切掉放在一边，把菜根放到了另一边。机器刨山药蛋，也快得很，机器挖下去，上来，土甩掉了，山药蛋放到了一个地方，干干净净的。玉米收割机，一下收两行；玉米棒子剥光了放在一个地方，秆子弄碎了丢在地上，后面跟着犁地，就把弄碎的秆子翻到地下了。如果要留着秆子喂牲口，机器弄碎后就一小堆一小堆落在地上，然后用车子拉走。棉花怎么用机器摘呢？我们也看到了。还不到摘棉花的时候，他们就另找些棉絮弄到棉花棵上；机器从地里走过去，一次能摘两行，用筒样的东西把棉絮吸到机器里面去了。没有开的棉桃还长得好好的，碰不掉，也挤不坏。吸进的棉花会带一些干叶子，到机器里就会把叶子弄掉。亲眼看到了，再也不能说不相信了。”赵怀义（河南省农业劳动模范）说：“苏联还研究出了人工下霜的办法。棉花开了四、五个桃，就可以收第一次。收时先‘下霜’把叶子都弄落，然后用机器收就更方便了。收过第一次后，没有开的桃继续吐絮，再收一次就可以收完。苏联还正在研究培养分两期同时成熟的棉花品种，使棉花不是陆陆续续地吐絮，而是分两次同时吐絮。这就更便于用机器收了。”我们过去想不通怎么用机器收棉花，原来是因为我们总是想着怎样去迁就庄稼，而不是想怎么叫庄稼迁就我们。
    赵怀义还说：“到苏联才听说插秧也能用机器。我想，用人手栽有的还死了，机器又没长眼睛，插下去还能不死许多？到人家地里一看，有几个妇女，一个人坐在一个机器上，正在毫不费力地插秧，一下就是十二行。我拿起一个试了一下，就是行，比手插得还好。一天一个人能插九公顷。机器割稻子，一天一台康拜因能收五十公顷，把我们半个乡的稻子一天就能收完了。稻田湿得很，机器怎么下去呢？人家计算得准，前十五天就把水放干了。”莫日格策说：“我们看了用机器栽烟，一架机器上坐七个人，一个人开机器，六个人管栽。机器开动着，挖了坑，接着自动把水刚好浇进坑里，接着又自动把苗放进去，把土封上，接着又把土压好，比我们用脚踩的好得多，保证百分之九十九能活，活百分之百也很可能。”
    用飞机杀虫、除草、施肥
    大家对于使飞机为农业生产服务，也非常发生兴趣。张学修说：“过去在家里听说苏联用飞机洒药治虫，我就想：那得用多少药水？飞那么快，会刚好洒到有虫的地里？洒到人身上怎么办？这回我可看见了飞机怎么撒药。是撒的药粉。先在有虫的地里插上大牌子，飞机飞到要撒药的地方就飞低了，那里该撒就刚好撒到那里。飞机还能上粪，把化学肥料配好，装在飞机上用机器撒到地里，然后犁地。这倒可以想通。可是人家还说飞机能上追肥，还能除草，我想，那可怎么办？原来上追肥是用一种水肥料，洒在叶子上，庄稼就可以吸收进去；除草是用一种药撒在地里，杀死了草，可是杀不死庄稼。真妙！”张德胜（太原郊区农民代表）说：“人家给我们解释，说是这样：那种药专杀死豆科植物，杀不死禾木科植物。许多草，像刺脚芽、大碗花等，都是豆科植物，撒了这种药就可以把它们杀死。这种药如果撒到了种大豆、豌豆、绿豆的地里，这些豆类庄稼也会死。因此，要使用这种科学技术，非集体化不行。如果像我们的地里那样，你的一小块种麦子，我的一小块种豌豆；你的一小块种谷子，我的一小块种绿豆，就没法用飞机除草了。”李顺达和郁善交也说：只有集体生产，才能使上拖拉机、康拜因；要想机械化，就要集体化；要想集体化，就得工业化。饶兴礼（湖北省农民代表）说：“我们乡下过去很少看到产业工人，连工厂的机器也没见过，别说种地的机器了。只是看到过镇上的裁缝，就认为工人阶级不过像裁缝一样，他们能领导我们吗？这次到苏联看到工人能造那么多那么大的机器，有那么大的创造性，使农民减轻多少劳动，提高多少产量；我真认清了，农民确实要受工人阶级领导才行！”
