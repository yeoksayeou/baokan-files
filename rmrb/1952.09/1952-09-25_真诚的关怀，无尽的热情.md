    Sincere Care, Endless Enthusiasm
    Yan Ling
    The members of the Chinese Farmers' Delegation saw Stalin during the "May Day" holiday this year.
    Speaking of "May Day," everyone was as excited as if they were in Red Square. Li Shunda said: We stood on the reviewing stand; the marching队伍 were very far away from us, but they looked at us and waved constantly, shouting loudly. When they came up to us, they held up the Chairman Mao images they were holding even higher and shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" They sang "The East is Red" in Chinese. Some handed flowers to us; some threw bunches and bunches of flowers over. Our hands were simply not enough. Zhang Xuexiu, a model agricultural laborer from Pingyuan Province, said: That day the parade lasted seven hours, and we stood for seven hours as well; the people in the parade kept waving to us, and we kept waving back to them, until our arms were sore. The delegates all said: It was on this day that we saw Stalin, the revolutionary leader most beloved by the people of the world, which is the greatest happiness of our lives!
    Our farmer representatives visited Stalin's birthplace, and everyone said it was a great honor. Lü Hongbin, a model agricultural laborer from Shandong Province, said: We stayed in Stalin's hometown, Gori City in Georgia, for three days. On the first day, we went to see the house where Stalin was born. Looking at that small house, looking at the bed where Stalin was born, the things he used as a child, everyone felt that it had a close relationship with us and with the happiness of the people all over the world. The people of Gori City, like the people in other parts of the Soviet Union, have a very deep feeling for the Chinese farmer representatives. The travel train we were staying on was parked at the station, and there were always many people coming to the station to see us. In the Mochinavi Collective Farm outside Gori City, some villagers dug up wine jars that had been buried underground for many years and wanted each of us to drink a glass. They held a banquet for us in the upstairs of an ordinary villager's house, and specially slaughtered a calf and two piglets for us. We sang "The East is Red" and "The Volunteer Army Song," and they sang "Moscow-Beijing." We danced the Yangko dance, and they performed Georgian folk dances. We feasted from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union love the Chinese people. Whether in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Kazakhstan, the people's enthusiasm for the Chinese farmer representatives was the same. The farmer representatives said: Soviet old ladies called us "dear Chinese children," and children called us "Chinese uncles," and anyone who saw us waved to us. We were often stopped by a group of children while walking, who wanted to say a few words to us; some Young Pioneers clung to our arms and draped their red scarves around our necks. Li Shunda said: Wherever we went, people gave us flowers, and if they couldn't hand them to us, they threw them into the car we were riding in. If we had saved all the flowers we received in this group in Western Ukraine, it would have been enough to fill a train car. Every time we arrived in a place, the farm would have an old villager give us a big loaf of bread, meat, and salt, which was their gift for welcoming distinguished guests. Once at a station in the Kirovograd Oblast, we received a huge loaf of bread, weighing more than fifty pounds. Comrade Jia Jianming and I accepted this precious gift, and we were sweating all over while carrying it! From Moscow to Kiev and Odessa, every place used the most brilliant dramas, songs, dances, and circuses to entertain us, with a gala and cocktail party almost every two or three days. At every cocktail party, everyone toasted "to the good health of Chairman Mao!" and "to the good health of Marshal Stalin!" again and again. This was sincere, not "courtesy." Li Shunda said: The Soviet people are really like family to us. An old man said when he met us: "I have loved you for a long time, I have been thinking of you, and today I finally see you!" Some farmer representatives said: Many Soviet old ladies have seen the movies "The White-Haired Girl" and "Daughters of China," and know that Chinese girls have suffered a lot and are full of combativeness, so they especially miss them. Many Soviet old ladies asked the delegation: "Why did so few of your girls come? I really want to see them!" Zhao Huaiyi, a model agricultural laborer from Henan Province, said: We visited an orphanage in the Soviet Union, where the children were orphans whose parents had died in the Great Patriotic War. They called us "father" and "brother" and wanted us to bring their red scarves and books back and give them to the orphans in our country whose parents had died in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. When we left there, they chased us for seven or eight miles to see us off. Watching the train leave, they shed tears. I have never shed tears before, but I cried at that time. Deng Guozhang, a model agricultural laborer from Songjiang Province, said: At the station in the Simonov District of Poltava Oblast, our train was not due to leave until midnight, and many Soviet people stood from dusk to midnight to see us off. Returning from a visit to the Khrushchev Collective Farm, an old man holding flowers in his hand stopped our tram on the way. He said: "These are the flowers I planted myself. When I heard you were coming, I waited here to give them to you." In the past, people said that China and the Soviet Union were friendly, but I didn't fully understand the meaning of this sentence. This time, I saw the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people with my own eyes. Another comrade said: Sometimes the train had already gone far, and you couldn't see the people who were seeing us off, but Old Deng was still waving vigorously. Deng Guozhang said: The enthusiasm in my heart couldn't stop!
    "The Soviet people are really concerned about our country's construction. Everyone asks as soon as they meet: How is your land reform going? How is production and construction going? How is people's livelihood? It's like asking about their own family affairs." Yang Xianting, a model agricultural laborer from Heilongjiang Province, said: "Soviet friends pointed to their tractors and asked us if we had any. We said: With your help, there are already some in the state-owned farms; and Soviet-style horse-drawn agricultural implements are being promoted in our hometown. They were very happy to hear that. Once at dinner, a young man sat next to me. He said to me: 'If the higher authorities approve, I am willing to go and help you with construction immediately.' Those who accompanied us on our visits to various places were all cadres specially transferred from the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture. Ribin, who was in charge of taking care of our visiting group, was originally an agricultural machinery engineer. We asked him: 'Doesn't this delay your work?' He said: 'Entertaining you is also my work. Making sure you have a good visit is my great task. Because you can build China better when you go back after your visit.' Mina, who cooked for us, was a student in Moscow in her twenties. We asked her: 'Don't you have other work?' She said: 'Making sure you are well-nourished and strong so you can have a good visit is my glorious task.'" Deng Guozhang said that they met a bureau chief of agriculture in Poltava Oblast who used to be a Red Army officer and had participated in the campaign to annihilate the Japanese Kwantung Army and had been to Northeast China. The farmer representatives gave him a portrait of Chairman Mao. He kissed it, wore it on his chest, and said to the representatives: "When China needs me, I can give my life!" Many Soviet agricultural workers have expressed to the Chinese farmer representatives that they are very willing to come to China to help us with agricultural construction.
    When the delegation visited the homes of villagers, some old ladies opened their boxes one by one and brought out their best things for everyone to see. They wanted to show all their happiness to their Chinese friends. They not only wanted Chinese farmers to see their happy lives as much as possible, but also hoped that Chinese farmers could live like them soon. They gave the Chinese farmer representatives many precious gifts, including their ethnic costumes, tools for grafting fruit trees, cameras, gramophones, the mobile red banner they used in labor competitions, the red scarves of the Young Pioneers, and commemorative badges engraved with Stalin's image; and the most precious thing was the good experience of collectivization and the good experience of improving production. Li Shunda said: Every time we arrived in a place, Soviet friends always told us their good experiences without reservation. Some crops were not yet ready for harvest, but in order to show us the harvesting situation, they could sacrifice a large piece of crops. They hoped that we would build China well quickly and strengthen the force for defending world peace. What the Soviet people love and hate is completely consistent with us; the Soviet people's friendship with us is really profound! Zhao Huaiyi said: In the collective farms we visited, there was not a single farm chairman or agronomist who was not very enthusiastic in answering our questions. We felt that we had troubled them too much, but they still said: Please ask more questions! Yang Xianting said: When we were at the Khrushchev Collective Farm in Poldava Oblast, the farm chairman gave us a report; we wanted him to sit down and talk, but he said: "As long as you feel that what I am saying is useful to you, I can stand here and talk, and I won't feel tired even if I stand for two more days." He answered our questions for three consecutive days, and he really stood for three days. Wu Fengqi said: Soviet friends told us all their thirty years of experience and lessons; how many detours we will avoid!
    The members of the Chinese Farmers' Delegation sincerely thank the Soviet people for their selfless assistance and sincere friendship. They unanimously stated that they must convey what they saw and learned in the Soviet Union to everyone they can reach; they must apply the valuable experience they have learned, combined with our actual situation, to production and work; they must run mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives well, increase production, support industry, and gradually embark on the road that Soviet farmers are taking today.

    真诚的关怀，无尽的热情
    燕凌
    中国农民代表参观团的团员们在今年“五一”节看见了斯大林。
    提起“五一”节，大家就像身在红场那样的兴奋。李顺达说：我们站在观礼台上；游行的队伍离我们老远老远，就望着我们，不断地招手，高声地呼喊。他们走到我们跟前，把手里举着的毛主席像举得更高，大声欢呼“毛泽东万岁！”用中国话唱“东方红”。有的把花送到我们跟前；有的把一把一把的花束扔过来。我们的手简直不够使唤了。平原省农业劳动模范张学修说：那天游行了七个钟头，我们也站了七个钟头；游行的人一直向我们招手，我们也一直向他们招手，把胳膊都摆酸了。代表们都说：就是在这一天，我们见到了全世界人民最热爱的革命领袖斯大林，这是我们一生最大的幸福！
    我国农民代表参观了斯大林诞生地，大家说这是极大的荣幸。山东省农业劳动模范吕鸿宾说：我们在斯大林的故乡——格鲁吉亚的哥里城住了三天。头一天就去看了斯大林诞生时住的房子。看着那个小屋，看着斯大林降生的床铺、小时候用过的东西，谁都觉得它和我们、和全世界人民的幸福都有密切的关系。哥里城的人们像苏联其他地方的人们一样，对中国农民代表有很深很深的感情。我们住的旅行火车停在车站上，总有很多人到车站来看我们。在哥里城外的莫契那维集体农庄，有些庄员把埋在地下多年的酒坛子扒出来，要我们每人喝一杯。他们在一家普通庄员的楼上为我们举行宴会，特为我们杀了一只小牛、两只小猪。我们唱“东方红”，“志愿军战歌”，他们唱“莫斯科——北京”。我们跳秧歌舞，他们表演格鲁吉亚的民族舞蹈。从下午五点一直欢宴到九点。
    苏联各民族人民都热爱中国人民。不论在俄罗斯、在乌克兰、在格鲁吉亚、在阿塞拜疆、在卡查赫，人们对中国农民代表的热情都是一样的。农民代表们说：苏联老太太叫我们做“亲爱的中国孩子”，小孩子叫我们做“中国叔叔”，任何人看到我们都向我们招手。我们往往在走路的时候被一群孩子拦住，要和我们说几句话；有些少年先锋队员攀着我们的胳膊，把他们的红领巾搭在我们的脖子上。李顺达说：我们走到那里，那里都有人给我们送鲜花，来不及送到手里的，就扔到我们坐的车子里。我们到西乌克兰的这个组，如果把收到的鲜花都保存起来，足够装满一节火车。每到一个地方，农庄都由一个老庄员给我们送大面包、肉和盐，这是他们迎接贵宾的礼品。有一次在基洛夫格拉州的一个车站，我们接到了一个最大的面包，有五十多斤。我和贾建明同志接受这珍贵的礼物，两个人抬着，累了一头汗！从莫斯科到基也辅和奥德萨，每个地方都用最精采的戏剧、歌舞、马戏招待我们，差不多两三天就有一次晚会和酒会。在每一次酒会上，大家都要一次又一次地“为毛泽东主席的身体健康干杯！”“为斯大林大元帅的身体健康干杯！”这是真心实意，不是“应酬”。李顺达说：苏联人民和我们真像一家人一样。一个老汉见了面就说：“我很早就爱你们，就想念你们，今天可见到你们了！”有些农民代表说：苏联很多老太太看过电影“白毛女”“中华女儿”，知道中国女孩子受苦多，而又富于战斗性，所以特别想念着她们。很多苏联老太太问代表团的人员：“你们的女孩子怎么来的这么少？我真想看看她们！”河南省农业劳动模范赵怀义说：我们在苏联参观了一个孤儿院，那里的孩子都是在卫国战争中死了父母的孤儿。他们叫我们“父亲”、“哥哥”，还要我们把他们的红领巾和书带回来，送给我国的在抗日战争、解放战争中死了父母的孤儿。我们离开那里时，他们赶了七八里路来送我们。看着火车开了，他们流了泪。我从来没有掉过泪，那时候可落泪了。松江省农业劳动模范邓国章说：在坡尔塔瓦州西门诺夫区的车站上，我们坐的火车要到半夜才开，许多苏联人从黄昏站到半夜，欢送我们。在赫鲁舍切夫集体农庄参观回来，有一个手里拿着鲜花的老汉，在途中把我们的电车挡住。他说：“这是我亲手种的花，听说你们来了，我就等在这里，把它送给你们。”过去人们都说中苏友好，我还不完全懂得这句话的意义，这回，我是亲眼看到中苏人民的友谊了。另外一位同志说：有时候火车已经开得很远了，看不见送别的人了，老邓还是一个劲地摆手。邓国章说：心里那股子热劲，实在停不下来啊！
    “苏联人民对于我国的建设实在关心。每个人一见面就问：你们的土地改革进行得怎么样了？生产建设怎么样了？人民生活怎么样？像问自己家里的事一样。”黑龙江省农业劳动模范杨显亭说：“苏联朋友指着他们的拖拉机问我们有没有，我们说：在你们的帮助下，国营农场里已经有一些了；在我们家乡正在推广苏联式的马拉机械农具。他们听了非常高兴。有一次吃饭的时候，一个青年人坐在我旁边。他对我说：‘如果上级批准，我愿意马上就去帮助你们建设。’陪我们到各地参观的，都是苏联农业部特别抽调出来的干部。负责照料我们这个参观组的里宾，原是一个农业机械工程师。我们问他：‘这不耽误你的工作吗？’他说：‘招待你们也就是我的工作。让你们参观得好，就是我的伟大任务。因为你们参观回去就可以把中国建设得更好。’给我们做饭的米娜，有二十多岁，是莫斯科的学生。我们问她：‘你没有其他工作吗？’她说：‘使你们营养得好，身体强壮，能好好参观，这就是我的光荣任务。’”邓国章说，他们在坡尔塔瓦州碰到一个农业局长，过去是个红军军官，曾经参加过歼灭日本关东军的战役，到过我国的东北。农民代表送给他一个毛主席像，他亲了一下，带在胸前，向代表们说：“中国需要我的时候，我可以献出我的生命！”苏联有许多农业工作人员都向我国农民代表表示，很愿意到中国来帮助我们进行农业建设。
    参观团到农庄庄员家里参观时，有些老太太把一个个箱子都打开，把她们最好的东西都搬出来给大家看，她们想把一切幸福都显现在中国朋友的面前。他们不只要使中国农民尽量看到他们的幸福生活，而且希望中国农民能很快地像他们一样的生活。他们送给中国农民代表许多珍贵的礼品，这些礼品中，有他们的民族服装，有接果木树用的工具，有照像机、留声机，有他们自己在劳动竞赛中用的流动大红旗，有少年先锋队员的红领巾，有刻着斯大林像的纪念章；还有最最宝贵的东西，那就是集体化的好经验和提高生产的好经验。李顺达说：每到一个地方，苏联朋友总是把他们的好经验毫无保留地告诉给我们。有些庄稼还不到收获的时候，为了给我们表演收割的情形，他们可以牺牲一大块庄稼。他们希望我们赶快把中国建设好了，加强保卫世界和平的力量。苏联人民爱的恨的，和我们完全一致；苏联人民对我们的友谊真是深厚！赵怀义说：我们所到的集体农庄，没有一个农庄主席和农学专家不是非常热心地给我们解答问题。我们觉得已经太麻烦他们了，他们还说：你们再多提些问题吧！杨显亭说：我们在波尔达瓦州赫鲁舍切夫集体农庄时，农庄主席给我们作报告；我们要他坐下讲，他说：“只要你们觉得我讲的对你们有用处，我可以一直站在这里讲下去，再站两天也不嫌累。”他连着三天给我们解答问题，就真的站了三天。吴凤岐说：苏联朋友把三十年的经验、教训一股脑儿告诉我们了；我们要少走多少弯路啊！
    中国农民代表参观团的团员们衷心感谢苏联人民这种无私的帮助和真挚的友情。他们一致表示，一定要把在苏联见到的、学到的，传达给他们能够接触到的每一个人；一定要把学来的宝贵经验，结合我们的实际情况，运用到生产中、工作中去；一定要把互助组、农业生产合作社办好，提高产量，支援工业，一步步走上苏联农民今天所走的道路。（附图片）
