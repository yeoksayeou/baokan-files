    The "Life of the People of Inner Mongolia" Pictorial Strengthened My Love for the Great Motherland

    Comrade Editor: After reading the "Life of the People of Inner Mongolia" pictorial in the People's Daily on August 23rd, my love for our great motherland has been strengthened.

    Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of Inner Mongolia have been liberated and have changed their way of life. From this pictorial, we can see that their children have already gone to school and received an education. The photos of the people's school in Bengbengshan Village and the Jiri Gan Ga reading group in Pao Tai Yingzi Village both prove that the political and cultural life of the Inner Mongolian people, who have never received cultural or political education, is gradually improving.

    Now, some of the people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have settled down, and they have built their own new houses. Therefore, there are conditions for developing production, eliminating diseases, and improving living conditions. The entire family of Lulu Majiabao can live a good life with "prosperity for both people and livestock." The family of Jiamusu has also built a new house, and Ansilama's child is growing so fat. They are grazing their fat and strong cattle and sheep on the grasslands, and their lives are getting better every day.

    From this pictorial, we can see the rapid changes in the lives of the Inner Mongolian people in an all-round way, which further inspires my love for the great motherland and my confidence in building the motherland.
                                                                                                                   Sun Hailiang

    看了“内蒙古人民的生活”画刊加强了我对伟大祖国的热爱
    编辑同志：我看了人民日报八月二十三日“内蒙古人民的生活”的画刊以后，加强了我对我们伟大祖国的热爱。
    内蒙古人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下翻了身，改变了他们的生活面貌。从这期画刊中，我们可以看到他们的孩子已经上了学，受到了教育。崩崩山村的民校和炮台营子村的吉日干嘎读报组的照片，都证明了从来受不到文化和受不到政治教育的内蒙人民，他们的政治、文化生活正在逐步地提高。
    现在，内蒙古自治区的人民有一部分已经定居下来了，他们新建了自己的房子。因此，就有了发展生产、消灭疾病和改善生活的条件，鲁鲁玛加保的全家才能过“人畜两旺”的好日子，加木苏的一家也修建了新房子，安斯拉玛的小孩长得那样胖，他们在草原上放牧着自己的又肥又壮的牛羊，生活一天天的更美好了。
    从这期画刊中可以全面地看到内蒙人民生活的迅速变化，因此也就更激发了我对伟大祖国的热爱和建设祖国的信心。    孙海良
