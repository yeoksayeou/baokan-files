Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th: To welcome the National Day opening ceremony, all staff members of the Tianlan Railway have basically completed all preparations for the opening of the line. Since the completion of the track laying project on August 23, preparations for the opening have been accelerated. As of now, the water supply and drainage equipment, communication telephone equipment, and the newly built 35 temporary ticket offices and 34 temporary platforms along the Tianlan Railway have all been completed. Most of the ballast has also been laid. This railway is another railway built with our own materials by the Central People's Government since the founding of the People's Republic of China, following the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The construction of this railway has received active support from people all over the country. The Southwest transported a large number of steel rails made by the country's own workers, the Northeast transported 27,700 tons of solid sleepers, and trainloads of cement were transported from distant Taiyuan, Chengde, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places. This year alone, 138,000 cubic meters of concrete were made with cement, and there were often more than 1,000 freight cars carrying supplies from various places. Railway bureaus across the country have also sent various talents, including many engineers and engineering management personnel. In particular, the Northwest CCP Party organization, the People's Government, and the Northwest Military Region, as well as the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, have supported the construction of the Tianlan Road with a large amount of manpower and material resources. In 1950 and 1951, the military and civilian laborers in the Northwest contributed a total of 3.45 million workdays to road construction. In 1952, another 9,600 civilian laborers participated in road construction. This included three Hui nationality road construction teams composed of Hui brothers from Gansu, Shaanxi, and North China. In long tunnels, on a construction site in the Bitter Water Area, and in this rush to prepare for the opening, they worked selflessly with the Han workers, generally increasing efficiency by more than 20%, and in the highest case by 100%.

    天兰路完成国庆节通车准备工作
    【新华社兰州二十四日电】为了迎接国庆节的通车典礼，天兰铁路全体职工已基本上做好了通车的一切准备工作。自八月二十三日铺轨工程完成后，通车的准备工作就加紧进行。截至目前止，天兰铁路沿线的上水、给水设备、通讯电话设备和新建的三十五座临时票房、三十四座临时站台都已全部修建完成。石碴也已大部铺好。这条铁路是中央人民政府成立以来继成渝铁路之后用自己的资材修成的又一条铁路。这条铁路的修筑曾获得了全国各地人民的积极支援。西南运来了大批祖国工人自制的钢轨，东北运来了两万七千七百吨坚实的枕木，从辽远的太原、热河、汉口、天津等地运来了整列车整列车的洋灰，光今年用洋灰作成的混凝土就有十三万八千方之多，载运各地支援物资的货车经常在一千辆以上。全国各铁路局又输送来各方面的人才，其中包括不少工程师和工程管理人员等；特别是西北中共党的组织、人民政府和西北军区以及西北各族人民，更以大量的人力、物力支援了天兰路的修筑。在一九五零年、一九五一年两年中西北的军工、民工共筑路三百四十五万工日，一九五二年又有民工九千六百人参加修路。其中包括以甘肃、陕西、华北的回民弟兄组成的三个回民筑路小队在内。他们在长隧道中，在苦水区某工地上，和这次赶作准备工作中，都和汉族工人一同忘我地劳动，工率普通提高百分之二十以上，最高的提高了百分之一百。
