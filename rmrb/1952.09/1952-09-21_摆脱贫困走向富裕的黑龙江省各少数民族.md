The province of Heilongjiang has a relatively large number of ethnic minorities. The province has minorities such as Mongolian, Korean, Hui, Kyrgyz, and Oroqen. The total population of all ethnic groups is 120,030. The Mongolian population is the largest, totaling 75,914 people, mainly distributed in Durbot Banner, the ninth district of Longjiang County, the eighth district of Zhenlai County, the third and seventh districts of Fuyu County, and Guo Hou Banner, etc., mainly engaged in agriculture and supplemented by animal husbandry. There are 23,098 Koreans, distributed near the rice-growing rivers in Tieli, Suihua, and Qing'an. There are 15,806 Hui people, scattered in various towns and cities in the province. There are 1,116 Oroqen people, distributed in various counties in the Heihe area, mainly engaged in hunting; now most of them have begun to settle down, and some have begun agricultural production. There are 468 Kyrgyz people, living in the Wujiazi Village of the third district of Fuyu County, mainly engaged in agricultural production.

During the Japanese imperialist rule, the ethnic minorities in Heilongjiang Province, like the Han working people, lived an extremely miserable life. The Oroqen ethnic group, with a very small population, was brutally suppressed and slaughtered, reducing it from several thousand people to more than one thousand one hundred people. The Japanese imperialists also poisoned them with opium and plundered their animal skins and other products at low prices. The Oroqen people could not afford cloth clothes in the summer, so they had to make clothes from animal skins; they could not afford grain and rice, so they had to eat hunted meat. The Mongolian, Korean, and other ethnic minority working people also suffered from the exploitation and oppression of Japanese imperialists, traitors, and feudal forces, working all year round without enough food or clothing. In Durbot Banner, a woman was so hungry that she ate the kang mat and still starved to death. The Mongolian people are accustomed to raising cattle and sheep, but the working people cannot afford to drink milk all year round. The clothes they wore were patched upon patched, and some families wore only one pair of cotton pants. Women rarely wore cotton clothes.

In August 1945, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China and annihilated the Japanese Kwantung Army, liberating the people of all ethnic groups from the abyss of suffering. Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, all ethnic minorities, like the Han people, carried out land reform, overthrew the landlord class, and were allocated the same land, houses, cattle, horses, and agricultural implements. They also carried out production campaigns, improved production technology, and expanded the area of cultivated land. Grain output increased year by year, and living standards have greatly improved accordingly. In Hutumo Village, Durbot Banner, where Mongolians live, in 1951, the entire village of 274 households (including 87 Han households) had 1,080 hectares of cultivated land, an increase of more than 200 hectares compared with the puppet Manchuria period; there were more than 900 head of cattle and horses, more than 300 head more than the highest number of 600 during the puppet Manchuria period. During the puppet Manchuria period, landlords' "superior land" could only produce more than 2,000 catties of grain per hectare, but in 1950, each hectare yielded 3,500 catties. This year, under the influence of the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative, Korean farmers actively organized and launched a patriotic production increase campaign. The masses were very enthusiastic about production and generally made patriotic production increase plans. More than 70 people in the Xunke Second Team of the Oroqen ethnic group organized hunts. In 1951, the total value of deer, elk, roe deer, orangutans, otters, bears, etc. hunted throughout the year was more than 460 million yuan.

Now the living standards of all ethnic minorities in the province have been significantly improved. Each Mongolian family has one to two dairy cows, and some have four or five. In Ailen Village, Sixth District of Tailai, before the land reform, Ailen Tun only had more than 90 hectares of land, five horses, 65 cattle, and three carts; now it has 160 hectares of land, 55 horses, 120 cattle, and twelve carts. Of the 33 households in the entire village, only three are poor households. Among them, two families have just moved from disaster areas. Thirty-four new houses have been built in the entire village. Hutumo Village, Durbot Banner, has a total of 274 households, with more than 900 cattle and horses, and 40 new houses have been built (materials from a 1951 survey). The living standards of Koreans have also improved. For example, among the 169 households in the three natural villages of Xinghe Village, Suihua, 83 households live a middle-peasant life, of which 23 households live a well-to-do middle-peasant life. Some have a surplus of 5,000 to 6,000 catties of grain. People almost all have three or four sets of clothes, and some individuals even have woolen clothes and skirts. Young men and women and elementary school students are dressed very brightly. Some families even have satin quilts. There are 19 sewing machines in the entire village. The Oroqen people, who could not afford cloth clothes all year round in the past, now have families who buy two bolts of cloth in one winter to make clothes, quilts, etc. The things they hunt are sold through their own cooperatives, and they are no longer deceived. More than ten households in the Xunke Second Team of the Oroqen ethnic group eat refined grains for half a year.

All ethnic minorities in the province live a warm and happy life and feel the greatness and loveliness of the motherland even more. They are very active in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, join the Chinese People's Volunteers, and donate airplanes and cannons. When war service requires laborers, they also actively sign up to participate. A total of 350 young men and women in Xinghe Village, Suihua, all requested to sign up for the army. Korean women also voluntarily went to the hospital to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteers, washed their clothes, and performed plays and dances for them. In the donation movement, Jiang Luoxiang, a Korean from Qing'an County, voluntarily saved 800 catties of rice prepared for his daughter-in-law and donated it to the Volunteers. Jin Jixuan donated ten shi of rice, about 3,000 catties. The Mongolian people also actively donated. More than 140 households in Daizhou Village, Zhenlai Eighth District, donated 25 million yuan. Some people donated silver dollars that had been stored for many years.

    摆脱贫困走向富裕的黑龙江省各少数民族
    马拉钦
    黑龙江省是一个少数民族较多的省份。全省有蒙古、朝鲜、回、吉尔吉斯、鄂伦春等少数民族。各族共计十二万零三十人。蒙族人口最多，共七万五千九百一十四人，主要分布在杜尔伯特旗、龙江县第九区、镇赉县第八区、富裕县第三、第七区及郭后旗等地，以农业为主，牧畜业为辅。朝鲜族有二万三千零九十八人，分布在铁骊、绥化、庆安等地适合种稻的河流附近。回族有一万五千八百零六人，散居省内各城镇。鄂伦春族有一千一百一十六人，分布在黑河专区各县，以游猎为主；现在大部分开始定居，一部分开始农业生产。吉尔吉斯族有四百六十八人，聚居在富裕县第三区五家子村，以农业生产为主。
    在日本帝国主义统治时期，黑龙江省少数民族和汉族劳动人民同样过着极其悲惨的生活。人口极少的鄂伦春族，被残酷地镇压和屠杀，由几千人减少到一千一百多人。日本帝国主义者并用鸦片毒害他们，用低价掠夺他们的兽皮等物产。鄂伦春族人民在夏季穿不到布衣，只好用兽皮做衣穿；吃不到粮米，只好吃猎得的兽肉。蒙族、朝鲜族及其他少数民族的劳动人民，也饱受日本帝国主义者及汉奸、封建势力的压榨和剥削，终年劳动，不得温饱。杜尔伯特旗有一个妇女，饿得吃掉了炕席，最后还是饿死了。蒙族人民习惯于养牛羊，但劳动人民终年吃不到牛奶。他们穿的衣服是补绽上缝补绽，有的全家穿一条棉裤。妇女更极少穿到棉衣。
    一九四五年八月，苏联出兵东北，歼灭了日本百万关东军，把各族人民从水深火热的苦难深渊中解放出来。在共产党和人民政府的领导和扶助下，各少数民族和汉族人民同样进行了土地改革，打倒了地主阶级，分得了同样的土地、房屋、牛、马、农具，又进行了生产运动，改进了生产技术，扩大了耕地面积，粮食产量一年比一年增加，生活也随着大大改善了。蒙古族聚居的杜尔伯特旗呼吐莫村，在一九五一年，全村二百七十四户（内汉族八十七户），有耕地面积一千零八十垧，比伪满时期增加了二百多垧；有牛、马九百多头，比伪满时最高数六百头超过了三百多头。伪满时期地主“上眼地”每垧只能打二千多斤粮食，一九五○年每垧地就打了三千五百斤。朝鲜族农民今年在金时龙农业生产合作社的影响下，积极组织起来，开展爱国增产竞赛，群众生产热情很高，普遍订了爱国增产计划。鄂伦春族逊克第二队七十多人，有十几个人组织出猎，一九五一年全年猎获的鹿、犴、狍子、猩猩、水獭、熊等，总值四亿六千多万元。
    现在全省少数民族的生活已显著提高。蒙族人民每家都有一至二头乳牛，多的有四、五头。泰来六区艾伦村前艾伦屯，土地改革时只有九十多垧地，五匹马，六十五头牛，三辆车；现在已有地一百六十垧，马五十五匹，牛一百二十头，十二辆车。全屯三十三户，只有三家是困难户。其中有两家是由灾区新搬来的。全屯又新盖了三十四间房子。杜尔伯特旗呼吐莫村共二百七十四户，有牛、马九百多头，新盖了四十所房子（一九五一年调查的材料）。朝鲜族生活也提高了。如绥化兴和村三个自然屯一百六十九户中，过中农生活的有八十三户，其中有二十三户过着富裕中农生活。余粮多的达五、六千斤。人们差不多都有三、四套衣服，个别的还有毛呢料子衣服和裙子。青年男女和小学生们穿的都很鲜艳。有的人家还有缎被子。全村有十九台缝纫机。过去终年穿不到布衣的鄂伦春族人民，现在有的人家一冬就买两匹布做衣服、被子等。他们所猎获的东西，通过自己的合作社推销，再也不受欺骗了。鄂伦春族的逊克第二队十多户有半年时间吃细粮。
    全省少数民族过着温暖幸福的生活，更感到祖国的伟大和可爱。他们在抗美援朝参加中国人民志愿军和捐献飞机大炮运动中，都非常积极。战勤需要民工时，他们也同样积极报名参加。绥化兴和村共有三百五十名青年男女，曾全部要求报名参军。朝鲜族妇女还自动去医院慰问志愿军伤病员，给伤病员洗衣服，并进行演剧、舞蹈给伤病员看。在捐献运动中，庆安县朝鲜族的姜洛香把准备娶儿媳妇用的八百斤大米都自动节约下来，捐献给志愿军。金基铉捐献了十石稻子，约三千斤。蒙族人民也积极捐献。仅镇赉八区代周村一百四十多户，即捐献二千五百万元。有的人把储存许多年的银元也捐献了。
