    Communist Party Members in People's Judicial Organs Must Guarantee the Complete Victory of the Judicial Reform Movement

    The judicial reform movement is a movement to oppose old legal viewpoints and reform the entire judicial organ. The purpose of this movement is to thoroughly transform and rectify people's courts at all levels, eliminate all degenerate and deeply entrenched bad elements beyond redemption, strengthen the organization and leadership of judicial organs, expose and criticize the influence of the Kuomintang's old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles, educate judicial personnel to draw a clear line of principle between new and old legal viewpoints, and clearly establish the people's revolutionary legal viewpoints and revolutionary work styles, so as to maintain the purity of people's courts at all levels in terms of politics, organization, and ideological work style, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and guarantee the smooth development of large-scale national construction in the future. Therefore, this movement is another important political task in consolidating and strengthening the regime after the victory of the "Three-Anti" struggle. Communist Party organizations in political and legal organs at all levels and all Communist Party members working in people's judicial organs must fully recognize the important significance of this movement, and under the unified leadership of local Party committees and governments, actively take action, first of all demanding a thorough liquidation of the influence of old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles within the Party, and strive to guarantee the complete victory of the judicial reform movement!

    The judicial reform movement currently underway in various places has revealed a great deal of material, indicating that the essence of old legal viewpoints is legal viewpoints that proceed from the standpoints of landlords and the bourgeoisie. All old laws served the interests of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. If we still maintain old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles after overthrowing and abolishing all old laws, it will be fundamentally incompatible with the interests of our country and people. For a Communist Party member, maintaining old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles is even more incompatible with the standards of a Communist Party member. Precisely because old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles are not merely general ideological work style issues, but rather issues of class standpoint, their corruption and harm to people's judicial organs are particularly great. In this judicial reform movement, a thorough criticism must be carried out in conjunction with the organizational rectification of judicial organs; especially Communist Party members in judicial organs must thoroughly investigate the influence of old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles in this Party rectification.

    Based on the Party rectification situation of the Party organizations of the five joint office organs of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the majority of Communist Party members working in the Central People's Judicial Organs are able to stand firm and handle problems with correct viewpoints and methods under the correct leadership of the Party and administration; however, some comrades still seriously retain remnants of old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles. Among them, one type of person comes from the exploiting classes, originally studied or did old legal work, and whose ideological standpoint has remained basically unchanged after joining the Party, retaining obvious and strong old legal viewpoints. Another type is severely influenced by old legal viewpoints, showing unstable standpoints on certain issues, often observing and handling problems with old legal viewpoints, and their old legal viewpoints are also linked to their empiricism or dogmatism. Still another type of person has an unclear understanding of the essence of law and the line of people's judicial construction, and is not active in studying business policies and theories, and is therefore influenced by old legal viewpoints to varying degrees, and some have even become prisoners of old legal viewpoints. The reasons for the above phenomena are: first, the remaining influence of old legal ideas and old morals and customs left over from the reactionary ruling class and the old society; second, the long-term dissemination of old legal viewpoints by bourgeois jurists; and third, the more or less influence and corruption of the ideological work styles of some retained and unreformed old judicial personnel on certain people. In addition, because we have not had time to systematically criticize and fight against old legal viewpoints after liberation, the influence of old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles on many judicial cadres is still quite serious. Judging from the old legal viewpoints revealed in this Party rectification of the central judicial departments, it can be imagined that this situation not only exists in the people's judicial organs in the new areas, but also largely exists in the old areas such as North China, which cannot but seriously endanger the cause of the Party and the people.

    Therefore, Communist Party organizations and members in judicial organs should regard the judicial reform movement as another democratic reform movement following the "Three-Anti" movement, closely combine the judicial reform movement with Party rectification work, and take opposing old legal viewpoints as one of the main contents of Party rectification. Doing so is completely in line with our overall task of Party rectification today. Our overall task of Party rectification today "is mainly to oppose the bourgeoisie's corruption and harm to the Party, raise the standards of Party members, and strengthen the Party's combat effectiveness, so as to lead the people of the whole country to struggle for the industrialization of the country and the future of socialism." All Communist Party members working in judicial organs should stand at the forefront of the judicial reform movement, play a leading and exemplary role, and use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to wage a resolute struggle against all old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles. Those Party members who still have strong old legal viewpoints or are influenced by old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles must first conduct thorough self-criticism in this movement and correct their mistakes. Those who are degenerate and have adhered to old legal viewpoints without change, in order to maintain the purity of the Party, must be given Party disciplinary action to educate the whole Party. Those Party members who hold leadership responsibilities and have old legal viewpoints must take the lead in making self-criticisms and must not adopt an attitude of confrontation or indifference and become an obstacle to the movement. Every Party organization and every Party member in people's judicial organs at all levels must, in accordance with the correct policies and principles of the Party and government regarding this judicial reform movement, mobilize the masses and promote the in-depth development of this movement. The attitude and performance towards this movement will be an important measure to test the Party spirit of every Party member in the judicial organs. Through this movement, we can further clarify the consciousness of Party members and non-Party members, draw a clear line of principle between new and old legal viewpoints and new and old judicial work styles, and improve our class consciousness a step further. In this movement, we should also educate and improve the masses, promote all judicial personnel to study the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought's views on the state and law, and improve everyone's professional level. This will be an important key to further develop the construction of people's judicial work in the future.

### 人民司法机关中的共产党员必须保证司法改革运动的彻底胜利

    人民司法机关中的共产党员必须保证司法改革运动的彻底胜利
    司法改革运动是反对旧法观点和改革整个司法机关的运动。这个运动的目的是要彻底改造和整顿各级人民法院，清除一切堕落蜕化和恶习甚深不堪改造的坏分子，加强司法机关的组织和领导，并揭露和批判国民党的旧法观点和旧司法作风的影响，教育司法工作人员划清新旧法律观点的原则界限，明确地树立人民的革命法律观点和革命工作作风，以便保持各级人民法院在政治上、组织上和思想作风上的纯洁性，进一步巩固人民民主专政，保障今后大规模国家建设事业的顺利开展。因此，这一运动是继“三反”斗争的胜利后，在巩固和加强政权工作上的又一项重要的政治任务。各级政法机关的共产党组织及所有在人民司法机关工作的共产党员，必须充分认识这一运动的重要意义，必须在当地党委和政府的统一领导下，积极行动起来，首先要求彻底清算旧法观点和旧司法作风在党内的影响，为保证司法改革运动的彻底胜利而斗争！
    各地正在开展着的司法改革运动，已经揭露了许多材料，说明旧法观点的本质是从地主、资产阶级立场出发的法律观点。一切旧法是为国民党反动统治利益服务的。在我们推翻和废除了一切旧法以后，如仍保持旧法观点和旧司法作风，则同我们国家和人民的利益根本不能相容。对于一个共产党员来说，如果保持旧法观点和旧司法作风，则和共产党员的标准更是不能相容的。正因为旧法观点及旧司法作风不只是一般的思想作风问题，而是阶级立场问题，所以它对人民司法机关的腐蚀和危害也就特别大。在此次司法改革运动中，必须结合司法机关的组织整顿予以彻底批判；尤其是司法机关中的共产党员，在此次整党中必须彻底清查旧法观点和旧司法作风的影响。
    根据此次中央政法合署办公五机关的党组织的整党情况来看，在中央人民司法机关中工作的共产党员，多数是能站稳立场，在党和行政方面的正确领导下，以正确的观点和正确的方法来处理问题的；但也有一些同志严重地存在着旧法观点和旧司法作风的残余。在他们当中，有一种人是出身于剥削阶级，原来学过或做过旧法工作，入党后思想立场基本未变，保有明显的浓厚的旧法观点。一种是受了旧法观点的严重影响，在若干问题上表现立场不稳，往往以旧法观点观察和处理问题，而且他们的旧法观点还和他们的经验主义或教条主义相联系。再一种人是对法律的本质及人民司法建设路线认识不清，而对业务政策和理论的学习又不积极，因而在不同程度上，受了旧法观点的影响，有些甚至作了旧法观点的俘虏。造成上述现象的原因：一是反动统治阶级和旧社会遗留下来的旧法思想和旧道德、习惯的残余影响；一是资产阶级法学家们多年来对旧法观点的传播；再就是一些留用的未经改造的旧司法人员的思想作风对于某些人的或多或少的影响和腐蚀。此外，也由于解放后我们还没有来得及对旧法观点进行系统的批判和斗争，因而旧法观点和旧司法作风在不少司法干部中的影响，至今仍相当严重地存在着。从中央司法部门此次整党所揭露的旧法观点来看，可以设想到，此种情况，不仅在新区人民司法机关中存在着，就是华北等老区也大体存在，这不能不严重地危害着党和人民的事业。
    因此，司法机关的共产党组织和党员，应把司法改革运动看作是继“三反”运动之后的又一次民主改革运动，要把司法改革运动和整党工作紧密结合起来，并把反对旧法观点作为整党的主要内容之一。这样作，是完全符合我们今天总的整党任务的。我们今天总的整党任务“主要是反对资产阶级思想对党的腐蚀和危害，提高党员的标准，加强党的战斗力，以便率领全国人民为国家的工业化和社会主义的前途而斗争”。所有在司法机关中工作的共产党员，应站在司法改革运动的最前列，发挥带头作用和模范作用，用批评和自我批评的武器，同一切旧法观点和旧司法作风进行坚决的斗争。那些至今仍存有浓厚的旧法观点或受旧法观点和旧司法作风影响的党员，必须在此次运动中首先进行彻底的检讨，改正自己的错误。对于那些堕落蜕化和坚持旧法观点不改的分子，为了保持党的纯洁性，必须予以党纪处分，以教育全党。那些身负领导责任而有旧法观点的党员，更必须首先带头检讨，决不能对此次运动抱对抗或冷淡轻视的态度而成为运动中的障碍。各级人民司法机关中的每一个党的组织和每一个党员，都必须按照党和政府关于此次司法改革运动的正确的方针政策，发动群众，推动这一运动的深入开展。对这一运动的态度和表现，将是检验司法机关中每一个党员的党性的一个重要尺度。经过这一运动，我们可以进一步弄清党和非党意识，划清新旧法律观点、新旧司法工作作风的原则界限，把自己的阶级觉悟提高一步。在这一运动中，我们还应该教育和提高群众，推动一切司法工作人员学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的国家观和法律观，提高大家的业务水平。这将是进一步开展今后人民司法工作建设的重要关键。
