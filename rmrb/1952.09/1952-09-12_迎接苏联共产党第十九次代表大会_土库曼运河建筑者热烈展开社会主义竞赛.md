    Greeting the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    Builders of the Turkmen Canal Enthusiastically Launch Socialist Competition
    [Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch] The twelfth is the second anniversary of the Soviet Ministerial Council's decision to open the Turkmen Great Canal. The builders of this great communist construction project are actively carrying out construction work. According to TASS news: The basic construction of the canal has started in August. At the starting point of the canal - Takhia-Tash, a material and technical base has been established for the canal project. The railways and many affiliated enterprises at the construction site have been completed. Hundreds of residential buildings in the workers' residential area, as well as administrative, cultural and service agencies have also been completed. Workers are excavating an eight-kilometer-long water supply canal from the Amu Darya to the future channel of the Grand Canal, in order to divert river water to the construction site to facilitate the dredging of mud by dredgers. After the earthwork began, the first 25,000 cubic meters of soil have been sent to the dam. Recently, the transportation work on the construction site has been extremely busy. A large number of dredgers, mobile power stations, suction dredgers, cranes and other equipment have been continuously transported to the construction site from various places. The freight volume of the new railway in August has doubled compared with July. The construction project of Kasanjik City, hundreds of kilometers south of Takhia-Tash, is also being accelerated. A power station, several woodworking enterprises and repair shops have been completed and put into operation, and workers' residences are also under construction.
    Recently, a large-scale socialist competition to welcome the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik) has been launched on the canal construction site. All work groups, workshops, and departments have participated in the Stakhanovite work shift. Good news keeps coming in the competition. The Yerashov work group that installs electrical equipment has completed this year's plan ahead of schedule. Motor vehicle drivers have transported thousands of tons more building materials and equipment than originally planned. Stakhanovite worker Kutuyev excavates 500 cubic meters of earth per shift every day, exceeding the quota by 200 cubic meters.
    Soviet scientists have made significant achievements in large-scale investigations and research in the Turkmen Grand Canal area. Recently, a group of scientists summarized the investigation work carried out in the Kara-Kum Desert area last year and in the first half of this year. The report they compiled is as long as sixteen volumes. Scientists conducted investigations in the 3,000-kilometer area of ​​Turkmenistan, drilled deep wells of up to 800 meters in the center of the desert, and discovered a large amount of material resources that can be used as building materials in the desert that has been uninhabited for thousands of years. This summer, Turkmenistan was particularly hot and dry. The surveyors overcame the difficult conditions in the desert and overfulfilled the investigation plan for the first half of the year. The July plan has also been successfully completed, solving various technical problems in engineering construction. This year, the land to be irrigated in northern and southern Turkmenistan will reach 6,000 square kilometers. Scientists from Uzbekistan discovered more than 2.5 million hectares of land suitable for irrigation in the area affected by the Turkmen Grand Canal, and completed preliminary soil improvement research on 760,000 hectares of land in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya. In addition, biologists, afforestation experts and other research work have also made significant achievements. In terms of afforestation, Suaeda and other shrubs have been planted on thousands of hectares of desert. Many places were planted by plane. It is estimated that about 30,000 Suaeda plants per hectare have taken root. (Attached picture)

    迎接苏联共产党第十九次代表大会
    土库曼运河建筑者热烈展开社会主义竞赛
    【新华社十一日讯】十二日是苏联部长会议发布关于开凿土库曼大运河决定的两周年纪念，这个伟大的共产主义建设工程的建筑者们正在积极进行建设工作。据塔斯社消息：运河基本建设工程已在八月间开始。在运河的起点——塔赫亚·塔什地方，已为运河工程创立了物质和技术基地。工地上的铁路和许多附属企业都已建筑完成。工人住宅区内数百栋住宅以及行政、文化和服务机关也已落成。工人们正自阿姆河挖掘一条八公里长的供水渠通向大运河未来河道，以便把河水引向工地便于吸泥机挖吸泥土。土方工程开始后，第一批二万五千立方公尺的泥土已被送到拒水堰上。最近工地上运输工作极为忙碌，大批挖泥机，巡回电力站、吸泥机、起重机等各种设备，源源不断地从各地运到工地上来。新铁路八月份的货运量已增为七月份的两倍。在塔赫亚·塔什以南数百公里的卡桑吉克城的建设工程，也正在加速进行。一座电力站、数座木工企业和修理工场都已落成开工，工人住宅也正在建筑起来。
    最近运河工地上已大规模展开迎接苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的社会主义竞赛，各个工作组、车间和部门都参加了斯塔哈诺夫式工作班。在竞赛中捷报频传。安装电气设备的叶尔萧夫工作组已提前完成了本年的计划。汽车司机们超过原定计划多运输了好几千吨建筑材料与设备。斯塔哈诺夫式工作者库图耶夫每天在一班时间内挖掘土方五百立方公尺，超过定额二百立方公尺。
    苏联科学家们在土库曼大运河地区进行的大规模调查研究工作，已获得重大成就。最近有一批科学家总结了去年和今年上半年在卡拉·库姆沙漠地区进行的调查工作，他们编的报告书就长达十六卷。科学家们在土库曼三千公里的地区进行了调查，在沙漠中心凿了一些深达八百公尺的水井，并且在千百年来荒无人烟的沙漠中发现了大量可作建筑材料的物质富源。今年夏天土库曼特别燥热，勘察者们克服了沙漠中的困难条件，超额完成了上半年的调查计划。七月份的计划也已顺利完成了，解决了工程建筑中的各种技术问题。今年在土库曼北部和南部调查的将受灌溉的土地，达六千平方公里。乌兹别克的科学家们在将受土库曼大运河影响的地区内，发现了两百五十多万公顷适于灌溉的土地，并在阿姆河下流七十六万公顷土地上完成了初步的土壤改良研究。此外，生物学家、造林专家等的研究工作也获得重大成就。在造林方面，已在数千公顷的沙漠上栽植了琐琐树及其他灌木。有许多地方都是用飞机下种的。据估计，每公顷约有三万株琐琐树生了根。（附图片）
