Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: Pravda published an article by Shirindib, Chairman of the Mongolian People's Republic Committee for the Defense of Peace, entitled "A Conference of Peace and Friendship."

    Shirindib said that the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of our country warmly welcomed the call and decisions of the Preparatory Meeting of the Peace Conference for the Asian and Pacific Regions. They are achieving new successes day by day in peacefully developing industry and agriculture and further promoting education, science, literature, and art. Under the slogan of strengthening international peace and friendship, the Mongolian people are victoriously carrying out their construction work. This year, our country has held a "Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month" and a "Mongolian-Czech Friendship Week" on a large scale, and held a conference with public leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. A ten-day "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Festival" is currently being prepared.

    In order to ensure peace in the Far East, the Mongolian people resolutely demand an immediate end to American military intervention in Korea, an end to the barbaric bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea, and a ban on the use of bacteriological weapons. The Mongolian people also demand the abolition of the separate San Francisco Treaty and the conclusion of a genuine peace treaty with Japan to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and enable the Japanese people to make peaceful progress. Shirindib's article concluded by saying that while preparing for this conference, the people of our country believe that the representatives of the people of Asia and the Pacific will surely find a common language—the language of peace and friendship—and make decisions in line with the interests of the people of all countries, aimed at ensuring lasting peace throughout the world.

    蒙古和平委员会主席锡林迪布论和平会议
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：真理报刊载蒙古人民共和国保卫和平委员会主席锡林迪布写的一篇文章，题为“和平与友谊的会议”。
    锡林迪布说，我国的工人、农民及知识分子热诚地欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的号召和决定，他们在和平发展工业农业及进一步促进教育、科学、文学和艺术方面，正一天天获得新的成就。蒙古人民正在加强国际和平与友谊的口号下，胜利地进行他们的建设工作。今年，我国大规模地举办了一个“蒙苏友好月”和一个“蒙捷友好周”，并和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的公众领袖举行了一次会议。目前正在筹备一个历时十天的“蒙中友好节”。
    为了确保远东的和平，蒙古人民坚决要求立即停止美国在朝鲜的军事干涉，停止野蛮轰炸朝鲜的和平城市与乡村，并禁止使用细菌武器。蒙古人民并要求废除单独的旧金山条约，缔结真正的对日和约，以防止日本军国主义的复活，并使日本人民有可能和平进步。锡林迪布的文章结语中说，我国人民在筹备这个会议时相信，亚洲及太平洋各国人民的代表一定会找出一种共同的语言——和平与友谊的语言——并作出符合各国人民利益的旨在确保全世界持久和平的决定。
