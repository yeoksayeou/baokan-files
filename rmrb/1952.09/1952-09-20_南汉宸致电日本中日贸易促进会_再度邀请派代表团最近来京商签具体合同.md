Japan-China Trade Promotion Association:
In order to effectively implement the China-Japan Trade Agreement, this committee, in accordance with Article 4 of the agreement, has telegraphed your side requesting that you send representatives to Beijing for specific discussions. Now, there are mutually beneficial transactions that can be specifically realized. However, some business and technical issues related to the implementation of the agreement must be resolved through face-to-face consultation between the two parties. Therefore, we are sending another telegram to request that your side send a delegation to Beijing in the shortest possible time to negotiate specific contracts. The signing of the China-Japan Trade Agreement is entirely in the interests of the people of both countries and has therefore won the support of the broad masses of the people of both countries. We believe that your side will make every effort to overcome all difficulties in order to achieve the successful execution of the agreement. We will do our best to provide the necessary care and assistance to your delegation upon their arrival in Beijing. We look forward to your reply.
Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade
