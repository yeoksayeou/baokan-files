    The northwest coast of Hainan Island is home to a small village. The village is surrounded by dozens of miles of yellow desert; the desert faces the vast sea and is backed by the rolling hills of the Wuzhi Mountain range. This village is called Zhenhai Village, and it is inhabited by about twenty fishing families.
    One evening in August this year, the People's Liberation Army sent a cultural troupe, and I also went there. The soldiers enthusiastically invited the fishermen of Zhenhai Village to come and see the play. More than a hundred fishermen came, walking in an orderly fashion, and sat down in the theater in sequence, not chaotic at all. Before the cultural troupe performed, the soldiers pulled the fishermen to sing. They sang five songs in a row, all very well, with accurate pronunciation. When the cultural troupe performed the opera "Glorious Military Dependents," a soldier next to me asked a militiaman with a gun, "Do you understand the language?" The militiaman shook his head and said, "Mo Ba Kai!" I asked the soldier curiously what this meant. "He said he understands the meaning, but not the words," the soldier replied. "Are they ethnic minorities?" "All Li people!"
    In the old society, I had heard people from Hainan Island say that the Li people had no clothes to wear, only using a piece of cloth to cover their shame, called "Bao Luan". They ate raw food, drank cold water, and lived like savages. But the Li brothers I see today are dressed very well, act orderly and politely, and their faces are full of joy. Obviously, this is the result of the implementation of the great ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government after liberation.
    When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were stationed here, they often drove the fishermen out of the village and then plundered them. The bandit troops robbed the fish that the fishermen had worked so hard to catch, without giving them a penny; they also chopped up the fishing boats to burn as firewood. In addition, there were requisitions of labor every three days and levies of money every five days, and the Li fishermen were squeezed so much that they could only eat sweet potato leaves, sleep on the yellow sand, cover themselves with weeds, and drink cold water. Finally, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops drove them all out of the village and set fire to the houses. Some of the Li people ran into the mountains, and some wandered around begging. At that time, they sang sadly:
    The Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek's gang,
    Behave like wild beasts, like tigers and wolves.
    We Li people have suffered,
    Our houses and property have been burned.
    Pigs were killed, chickens were caught,
    The courtyard is overgrown with grass and has become a forest.
    Homeless, we hide in the mountains,
    Wandering around begging.
    Another song sang:
    Chiang Kai-shek will surely die halfway,
    He will die halfway and maggots will grow.
    The stench will fill the sky like manure,
    Crows will peck and dogs will tear.
    Living in such a miserable situation, the Li people urgently demanded to stand up and be masters of their own destiny. Many people joined the guerrillas; those who remained looked forward to the liberation army crossing the sea like they were waiting for the stars and the moon. It was not until after the People's Liberation Army crossed the sea that the farmers of Zhenhai Village sang the first happy song since the dawn of time:
    Chairman Mao, what a good plan,
    Thousands of sailing ships crossed Qiongzhou.
    A thunderclap on the flat ground,
    A dragon rises from the bottom of the sea.
    The iron tree blooms and the stone turns over,
    From now on, the Li people see the blue sky.
    ……………………
    A new life came to Zhenhai Village with the fluttering red flag of the People's Liberation Army. The Li people returned from the mountains and threw away the bowls they used for begging to rebuild their homes. The People's Government provided them with loans to build new houses, repair boats, and buy new fishing nets. This has become a new fishing village.
    The People's Liberation Army stationed there often help the Li people push boats and dig wells... The doctors in the army provide free medical treatment, vaccinations, and inoculations for the Li people. During the first month of the lunar calendar this year, the young and strong people of Zhenhai Village all went to fish or sell fish, leaving only the old people and children in the village. Suddenly, a fire broke out. When the People's Liberation Army saw it, they rushed over as if their own house was on fire, regardless of everything, and put out the fire. As a result, only one thatched house was damaged. When the fishermen carried fish to the market, they met familiar soldiers on the road, and the soldiers rushed to help them carry the load. No matter how heavy the load, the soldiers would carry it for ten or twenty li. The two villages on this beach are like relatives, very close to each other, discussing things when they encounter them, and often holding joint literary and art evening parties. When the army brings a cultural troupe, a film projection team, or holds its own evening party, it always invites the fishermen to watch. "Liu Xiya (go to see the play)!" As soon as the village cadre calls out, the whole village comes happily. The fishermen give a thumbs up:
    "Chairman Mao is Ding Hao (the best)!"
    "The People's Liberation Army is Ding Hao!"
    There are too many things to mention. Now I will take two more small things to illustrate how harmonious and deep the relationship between the army and the people is.
    When I first arrived in this village, I didn't understand a word. The fishermen greeted me warmly: "Comrade, Guang Die (have you eaten)?" I could only answer with a smile. A soldier was buying cigarettes, and I asked casually, "Do you have bananas?" A Li youth next to me said a few words and led me to walk around the village. He walked and shouted, and as a result, a woman brought out six eggs. It turned out that he saw that my face was yellow and thought I was sick and wanted to eat eggs. I waved my hand and said no. Coincidentally, there was a large "sea dog" shell in front of this house. I found it strange, kicked it with my foot, and said, "This strange thing!" The young man thought I wanted the "sea dog" again, and led me to walk again, walking and shouting. As a result, another woman brought out two "sea dogs". I was really embarrassed. Fortunately, a Hainanese soldier came and told him that I was asking for bananas. After everything was clarified, we all laughed. The people here are so close to the People's Liberation Army like family, and care for them like brothers.
    I also saw such a thing with my own eyes. The army wanted to transport grain and wanted to rent a few fishing boats. The cadres discussed it in advance, and the boat fare must be paid a little more, so that the fishermen would not suffer. The boat owner came. The cadre first asked: "Recently, how many fish can a boat catch at most in a day?" The fisherman replied:
    "A day can earn forty catties of rice." The cadre said: "We want to rent ten boats to transport grain, only for one day, how about giving each boat fifty catties of rice?" But the fishermen resolutely did not want a grain of rice, and said that they would complete the transportation task very well. The army insisted on giving fifty catties of rice, so it was deadlocked. The cadre said: "If you don't accept the grain, we will carry it on our shoulders." The fishermen discussed it and said: "Comrade, it's a hundred li back and forth, or we will transport it, half for the public, half for ourselves, and twenty catties of rice per boat is enough." "No, fifty catties can't be short, we can't let you suffer!" "Okay, twenty-five catties is enough!" "No, fifty catties can't be less!" As a result, the fishermen reluctantly accepted the freight of fifty catties of rice per boat.

    海南岛的渔村黎民和人民解放军
    李养正
    海南岛西北的海滨上，有一座小村庄。村庄周围几十里都是黄漫漫的沙漠；沙漠前临壮阔的大海，背靠起伏的五指山余脉的岗峦。这个村庄叫镇海村，住着约二十来家渔民。
    今年八月的一天晚上，解放军派来了文工团，我也到了这里。战士们热情地把镇海村的渔民也请来看剧。渔民来了一百多人，走得很整齐，进了剧场挨次序坐下，一点也不乱。文工团表演前，战士们拉渔民唱歌。他们一连唱了五支歌，都唱得很好，发音也准确。文工团演“光荣军属”歌剧的时候，我旁边的一个战士问一个荷枪的民兵：“懂话不？”那个民兵摇摇头说：“莫巴开！”我奇怪地问那个战士这是说什么。“他说意思懂，话不懂。”战士答。“是少数民族？”“全是黎民！”
    在旧社会，我曾听到过海南岛的人说，黎民没有衣穿，只用一块布遮羞，叫做“包卵”。吃生的，喝冷的，过着野人般的生活。可是我今天所见到的黎民兄弟却穿得很好，行动整齐而有礼貌，脸上流露着欢乐的神色。很显然，这是解放以后中国共产党和人民政府伟大的民族政策实施的结果。
    蒋匪军驻扎在这里的时候，时常把渔民赶出村去，然后大肆抢掠。匪军们抢走渔民辛辛苦苦捕来的鱼，一钱不给；把渔船也砍了当柴烧。再加上三日一夫，五日一款，黎族渔民被压榨得只能吃红薯叶子，睡黄沙，盖野草，喝冷水。最后蒋匪军把他们一齐赶出村去，把房子放火烧光。黎民有的跑进了山，有的四处流落乞讨。那时他们悲惨地唱着：
    刮民党唎蒋匪帮，
    野兽行为如虎狼。
    我们黎民遭了殃，
    房屋财产被烧光。
    猪被杀尽鸡捕尽，
    屋场生草变山林。
    无家可归藏上山，
    四处讨乞去流浪。
    另一支歌唱道：
    蒋匪一定半路死，
    死在半路就生蛆。
    臭气冲天如大粪，
    乌鸦去啄狗去撕。
    生活在这样悲惨的境遇里，黎族人民迫切要求翻身做人。很多人投入了游击队；留下的便像盼星星盼月亮一样，盼解放大军渡海。一直到解放军渡海以后，镇海村农民才唱出破天荒的第一首愉快的歌：
    毛主席，好计谋，
    千桅帆船渡琼州。
    平地春雷一声响，
    海底翻腾起蛟龙。
    铁树开花石翻身，
    从此黎民见青天。
    ……………………
    新的生活，随着解放军的飘扬的红旗来到了镇海村。黎民从山上回来，扔掉了讨饭吃的碗来重建家园。人民政府贷款给他们盖了新房子，修了船，置了新渔网。这里成了新的渔村。
    当地住着的解放军，经常帮助黎民推船、挖井……部队里的医生，免费给黎民治病、种痘、打防疫针。今年夏历正月间，镇海村里年轻力壮的人都去打鱼或卖鱼去了，村里只剩下老头和小孩，忽然起了火。解放军看见了，像烧着自己的房子一样，不顾一切地猛奔过来，把火给扑熄了。结果只烧坏了一间草房。渔民挑鱼上市，在路上遇见熟识的战士，战士们就抢着帮他们挑。不管担子多重，战士们一挑就是一、二十里。这沙滩上的两个村庄，就像亲戚似的，往来非常亲密，遇事就商量，还经常共同开文艺联欢晚会。军队上来了文工团、电影放映队，或者自己举行晚会，一定请渔民来看。“流西亚（看戏去）！”村干部一召唤，全村的人便欢腾地来了。渔民伸着大拇指：
    “毛主席拿谷问！（顶好）”
    “解放军拿谷问！”
    提起来事情是太多了。现在我再拿两点小事来说明军民之间的感情是如何融洽和深厚。
    我初次到这村里，一句话不懂。渔民亲热地跟我打招呼：“同志，光爹（吃了饭没有）？”我只能以笑回答。有一个战士在买香烟，我顺口问了一句“有香蕉没有”。旁边一个黎族青年嘴里说了几句什么，就引着我在村里走起来。他边走边嚷，结果有个妇女拿出六个鸡蛋来。原来他看见我脸黄，以为我是病号，想吃鸡蛋哩。我摆了摆手说不是。恰巧这家门前有块大“海狗”的前壳，我觉得稀奇，用脚踢了一下，嘴里说了句：“这个怪东西！”这年青人又以为我是要“海狗”，就又引着我走，边走边嚷。结果又一个妇女提出两只“海狗”来。我真为难了。幸喜来了一个海南战士，才告诉他我问的是香蕉。事情一搞清楚，我们都大笑起来。这里的人民对于解放军，就是这样的亲睦如家人，关怀如兄弟。
    我还亲眼见到这么一件事。部队要运粮食，想租用几只渔船。干部们先商量好了，船费一定要多给一点，不让渔民吃亏。船主来了。干部先问：“最近，一条船一天最多能打多少鱼？”渔民答道：
    “一天能挣四十斤米。”干部说：“我们想租十条船运粮，只要一天，给每条船五十斤米怎么样？”但渔民坚决不要一粒粮，还说要很好地完成这个运输任务。部队上坚决要出五十斤米，于是僵住了。干部说：“你们不收粮，我们就用肩去挑。”渔民商量了一下说：“同志，来去百里，还是我们去运，一半为公，一半为私，给每条船二十斤米够了。”“不行，五十斤不能短，咱们可不能亏你们！”“好吧，二十五斤满够了！”“不行，五十斤一粒也不能少！”结果还是渔民很不情愿地接受了每船五十斤大米的运费。
