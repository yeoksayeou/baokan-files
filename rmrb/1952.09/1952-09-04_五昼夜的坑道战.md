    Five Days and Nights of Tunnel Warfare
    Yang Yixiong, Zhou Zhiping
    Hill 190.8 is a mountain peak in the central buffer zone of the Korean front. It is only separated by a 300-meter-wide open space from Hills 334 and 418, which are occupied by more than a regiment of the U.S. 45th Division. Since the 2nd Detachment of a certain unit of our Chinese People’s Volunteer Army occupied this hill in May of this year, Gao Yunhe and his heroic squad have been tasked with defending it. The hill is surrounded by the enemy on three sides, and its terrain is relatively low, like a sharp knife inserted into the enemy's position, posing a great threat to the enemy. On the third day after our army occupied this hill, the enemy launched an attack. The battle lasted for four days and nights. The enemy's strength increased from a platoon to a battalion, and they launched more than ten assaults, all of which were successively repelled by the warriors of Gao Yunhe's squad, inflicting more than 250 casualties on the enemy.

    Welcoming New Victories
    In order to defend the position and annihilate more enemies, Gao Yunhe led the soldiers to build fortifications day and night. Within half a month, they built two solid tunnels and stored ammunition and food.
    On June 10th, the battalion commander and political instructor came to the position and conveyed the order from higher authorities: "Actively strengthen vigilance and preparedness, and be ready to repel the enemy's attack at any time." The battalion leaders also encouraged everyone, saying, "Comrades, you should be extra vigilant and defend the position. Strive for everyone to become a hero, and do not go down the mountain without making meritorious contributions!" The regimental leaders also personally came to the position to offer condolences and give specific instructions.
    The soldiers all formulated plans for making meritorious contributions and operational plans, preparing to deal a head-on blow to any invading enemies.

    Heroic Resistance
    One clear morning, the weather was very fine. The roar of engines suddenly echoed over Hill 190.8. Twelve enemy Mustang and jet fighters flew low and circled, carrying out frantic bombing and strafing of our positions. Tons of steel were poured onto the ground, causing intense explosions and fires; at the same time, the enemy also launched a large number of smoke bombs, and the entire hill was immediately shrouded in a cloud of smoke. The clear sky also changed color.
    At this moment, one enemy platoon after another rushed up from the front and back of the mountain. The soldiers of Gao Yunhe's squad calmly met the enemy. Gao Yunhe dragged a machine gun out of the fortifications and fired fiercely at the approaching enemy. At this time, hand grenades and demolition tubes also blossomed like firecrackers in the enemy ranks. Piles of American soldiers fell in disarray. Soldier Zhang Chengen initially used an automatic rifle to shoot, and later switched to a submachine gun. Although he was wounded four times, he persisted in fighting. Rocket launcher Pu Derong accurately fired rocket launchers, killing or wounding more than fifty enemies. Gao Yunhe's squad fought fiercely for more than six hours, repelling eleven enemy assaults in a row.

    Tunnel Warfare that Shook the Mountains
    After the enemy's fierce attacks failed, they became even more frantic, sparing no expense and driving groups of American soldiers from all directions, trying to seize Hill 190.8. Our heroes, in order to preserve their strength, moved into the tunnels and continued to counterattack.
    As soon as the soldiers entered the tunnel, the enemy used explosives to collapse more than five feet of one entrance. Everyone disregarded the enemy's machine gun fire and quickly dug open the sealed entrance. Gao Yunhe and Deputy Squad Leader Rui Chaoshou each guarded an entrance. Gao Yunhe encouraged everyone, saying, "Comrades! If we want to defend the position, we must hold the tunnels and use the tunnels to cooperate with the main force to defeat the enemy. Everyone must overcome impatience and the idea of ​​fighting hard, and first do a good job of fortifying the tunnels." He then said, "I am determined to overcome all difficulties and complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party and higher authorities." Under Gao Yunhe's encouragement, the soldiers all started working together, using biscuit boxes, rice bags, etc. to fill with soil and build a temporary fortification, and spread wet coats on top to prepare to resist the enemy.
    The enemy's hand grenades kept being thrown into the cave. Three or four of them landed at the feet of Deputy Squad Leader Rui Chaoshou, who was guarding the entrance. He immediately kicked them back with his feet, and they exploded on the enemy's side. The enemy also used flamethrowers to spray flames at the entrance, burning the entrance red-hot. Gao Yunhe and Rui Chaoshou each threw a hand grenade, blasting down a lot of loose soil to put out the flames. The enemy became more and more frantic, and inhumanely threw poison gas bombs into the cave. At the point of the explosion, a grayish-white smoke with a slightly yellow-black color rose up. The soldiers immediately put on gas masks or anti-gas masks. They also adopted tactics of mutual cooperation between the two entrances, often organizing three or two people to counterattack outwards. Rui Chaoshou twice took the lead in rushing to the mountain top communication trench, killing or wounding more than fifty enemies, and capturing two 60 mortars, twenty shells, and two automatic rifles. Gao Yunhe took this opportunity to move all the ammunition in the ammunition depot outside the cave into the cave.
    The heroes guarding the tunnel were subjected to a severe test. The dry food was eaten, and the drinking water was also drunk. Hunger and thirst plagued everyone. Gao Yunhe dug up half a bowl of muddy water from the bottom of the water tank bit by bit, but when he brought the bowl to his mouth, he put it down again, and then divided the half bowl of water for the comrades to drink. Some people were so thirsty that they could hardly bear it, so they had to drink their own urine. Later, some comrades discovered a small hole in the tunnel wall, which seeped out a drop of water every five minutes or so. Everyone was unspeakably happy, and took turns sucking that drop of nectar to quench their thirst. Although the environment was so difficult, the soldiers' fighting will was even stronger. Accompanying the sound of machine guns and hand grenades exploding, the magnificent song "Singing for the Motherland" was constantly heard in the cave.

    Solemn Oath
    On the night of the 12th, Li Hanyou, the company commander of the 3rd Company, was ordered to lead a platoon to counterattack the enemy on Hill 190.8 and reinforce Gao Yunhe's squad, which was still fighting. After a fierce battle, they finally joined up with the heroes in the tunnel. This greatly boosted everyone's determination and confidence to defend the position.
    In the tunnel, a mixed Party-Youth League branch was established, with Comrade Li Hanyou as the branch secretary. A Party-Youth League member meeting was held, and other soldiers were absorbed to participate. The branch put forward the slogan "Create invincible steel warriors" and mobilized everyone to fight bravely. Branch Secretary Zhao Jinbang expressed his determination and, on behalf of the Party, requested that every comrade withstand the test, that Party and Youth League members should play a core role, and that non-Party and Youth League members should strive to make meritorious contributions in battle and join the Party and the League. Gao Yunhe was the first to respond to the Party's call, raising his clenched fist and swearing: "I am a Communist Party member, I will resolutely fight to defend world peace, and the current task is to hold Hill 190.8. I am determined to fight to the end to complete this task!" This short oath inspired every comrade. Zhang Chengen, who was wounded four times but still persisted in fighting, also swore: "Although I am not a Communist Party member, I am a good son and daughter of the Chinese nation and will never shame the motherland and the people." The wounded Yao Caitang also sat up vigorously and said excitedly: "I got wounded too early and didn't complete my mission. I'm really sorry to the Party. I must persist in fighting and never complain." Then, all the comrades raised their right hands and solemnly swore on the heroic position: "In any difficult and difficult situation, we will not waver or leave our posts! To defend the motherland and world peace, we are determined to fight to the end on Hill 190.8!"

    Victorious Transfer
    From the second day they entered the tunnel, they lost contact with their superiors, but radioman Yang Guoxing always tried his best to restore it. He braved artillery fire to rush out of the cave and insert the antenna pole more than twenty times. He was afraid that the telephone would be damaged by the artillery fire, so he held it in his arms all day long. Later, he finally connected with the detachment headquarters, and they heard the instructions and encouragement from the division and regimental leaders. On the evening of the 16th, the order came: transfer under the artillery cover of the main force! The soldiers were really reluctant to leave this glorious position, but in order to strike the enemy more effectively, they had to transfer. Li Hanyou, the company commander of the 3rd Company, led a group to open the road, and Deputy Squad Leader Rui Chaoshou led a group to counterattack the enemy on the hilltop. Thanks to the spirit of perseverance and the high degree of class love displayed by all the comrades, they successfully completed the transfer mission without any casualties.

    Honor Belongs to the Heroes
    Gao Yunhe and his squad of heroes fought bloody battles on Hill 190.8 for five days and nights, eliminating more than 400 enemies and creating favorable combat conditions for the main force. In the battle to seize Hill 190.8, they annihilated more than 2,400 enemies and destroyed nine tanks, achieving brilliant victory. The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recognized that all the comrades of Gao Yunhe's squad had made contributions to the motherland and the cause of world peace, and awarded them a special merit once, and awarded the squad the honorary title of "Second-Class Hero Squad"; Squad Leader Gao Yunhe won the honor of "Second-Class Hero" and was awarded a special merit once.

    五昼夜的坑道战
    杨亦雄　周之屏
    一九○·八高地是朝鲜前线中部缓冲地带的一个山头，与美军四十五师一个团以上兵力盘据着的三三四和四一八两个高地只隔着一块三百多米宽的开阔地。自从今年五月间我志愿军某部二支队占领了这个高地之后，高云和与他这一班的英雄们便担任了防守的任务。高地的三面都是敌人，山势较低，犹如一把尖刀插入敌人的阵地里，给敌人以极大的威胁。在我军占领这个高地后的第三天，敌人便发动了进攻。战斗连续进行了四个昼夜，敌人的兵力由一个排增加到一个营，进行了十多次冲锋，都先后被高云和班的勇士们击溃，敌人伤亡二百五十多名。
    迎接新的胜利
    为了固守阵地，更大量地歼灭敌人，高云和领导着战士们不分昼夜地赶筑工事。半个月内，他们修好了两个坚固坑道，并储备了弹药和粮食。
    六月十日，营长和指导员来到阵地，传达了上级命令：“积极加强戒备工作，随时迎击敌人的进攻。”营首长们并鼓舞大家说：“同志们应该加倍警惕，坚守阵地。争取人人当英雄，不立功不下山！”团首长也亲自到阵地上来慰问，并作了具体的指示。
    战士们都拟订了立功计划和作战方案，准备予敢于来犯的敌人以迎头痛击。
    英勇的阻击
    一个清晨，天气十分晴朗。一九○·八高地的上空突然响起了马达的吼叫。十二架野马式和喷气式敌机低飞盘旋，向我方阵地进行疯狂的轰炸和扫射。成吨的钢铁往地面上倾泻，引起强烈的爆炸和燃烧；同时敌人又打来大量的烟幕弹，顿时整个山头便笼罩在一片烟雾中。明朗的天空也变了颜色。
    就在这个时候，敌人一个排跟着一个排从山前山后冲上来。高云和班的战士们沉着地迎击着敌人。高云和拖起机枪跳出工事，对着扑上来的敌人猛烈扫射，这时候手榴弹和爆破筒也像鞭炮一般在敌群里开花。乱成一团的美国兵一堆堆地倒下。战士张成恩开始时用自动步枪射击，后来又换上了冲锋枪。他虽然四次负伤，仍然坚持战斗。火箭炮手普德荣准确地发射着火箭炮，杀伤了敌人五十多名。高云和班激战六个多钟头，连续击退敌人十一次冲锋。
    震撼山岳的坑道战
    敌人猛扑失败后变得更加疯狂，竟不惜一切，驱赶着一群群美国兵从四面八方往上涌，要想把一九○·八高地争夺过去。我们的英雄们为了保存力量，转入坑道继续进行反击。
    当战士们一进入坑道，敌人就用炸药把一个洞口炸塌了五尺多。大家不顾敌人机枪的封锁，迅速地把封住的洞口扒开。高云和与副班长芮朝寿各守住一个洞口。高云和鼓舞大家说：“同志们！我们要想守住阵地，就必须坚守坑道，利用坑道配合主力打垮敌人。大家必须克服急躁和硬拚的想法，先把坑道的工事做好。”他又跟着说：“我决心克服一切困难，完成党和上级交给我的任务。”战士们在高云和的鼓动下一齐动手，用饼干箱、米袋等装上了土，搭成一道临时工事，并把大衣浸湿了铺在上面，准备抗击敌人。
    敌人的手榴弹不断往洞里扔进来，有三四个落在守在洞口的芮朝寿副班长的脚跟前，他立刻用脚把它们踢回去，在敌人那边爆炸。敌人又用喷火器朝着洞口喷射火焰，把洞口烧得通红。高云和与芮朝寿各打出一个手雷，炸下来许多碎土把火焰扑灭。敌人愈来愈疯狂，竟灭绝人性地向洞内投掷毒气弹。爆炸声起处，腾起一股灰白微带黄黑颜色的烟雾。战士们马上戴上防毒面具或防毒的口罩。他们并且采取两边洞口互相配合的战术，经常组织三两个人向外反击。芮朝寿两次带头冲到山顶交通沟，杀伤敌人五十多名，并缴获六○炮两门、炮弹二十发、自动步枪两支。高云和趁这个机会，把洞外弹药库里的弹药全部搬进洞里来。
    守卫在坑道里的英雄们受到了严重的考验。干粮吃光了，饮水也喝光了，饥渴困扰着每一个人。高云和从水缸底一点一滴地挖上来半碗泥水，但是当他把碗端到嘴边时却又放了下来，随后就把这半碗水给同志们分着喝。有些人实在渴得难以忍受了，便只好喝自己的小便。后来有同志发现坑道壁上有一个小洞，约莫五分钟渗出一滴水，大家有说不出的高兴，便轮流吮吸那一滴甘露解渴。环境虽然是这样的艰苦，但是战士们的战斗意志更加坚强。伴随着机关枪和手榴弹的爆炸声，洞里不时传出雄壮的“歌唱祖国”的歌声。
    庄严的宣誓
    十二日夜里，三连连长李汉有奉命带领一个排反击一九○·八高地的敌人，增援坚持战斗的高云和班。他们经过了激烈的战斗，终于与坑道里的英雄们会合了。这大大鼓舞了大家坚守阵地的决心和信心。
    在坑道里，成立了党团混合支部，由李汉有同志为支部书记，召开了党团员大会，并吸收其他战士参加。支部提出了“创造无敌的钢铁战士”的口号，动员大家奋勇战斗。分支书赵金邦表示自己的决心后，并代表党要求每一个同志要经得起考验，党团员应起核心作用，非党团员应在战斗中争取立功入党、入团。高云和首先响应党的号召，举起紧握的拳头宣誓：“我是个共产党员，我要坚决为保卫世界和平而奋斗，目前的任务就是守住一九○·八高地，我决心为完成这一任务而战斗到底！”这段简短的誓词激励了每一个同志。负伤四次仍然坚持战斗的张成恩也宣誓：“我虽然不是共产党员，但我是中华民族的好儿女，决不给祖国和人民丢脸。”受伤的姚彩堂也使劲坐起来激昂地说：“我挂彩太早了，没有完成任务，真对不起党。我一定要坚持作战，决不叫苦。”跟着，全体同志都举起了右手，在英雄阵地上庄严宣誓：“在任何艰苦困难的情况下，不动摇，不离开岗位！为保卫祖国与世界和平，决心在一九○·八高地上战斗到底！”
    胜利转移
    他们从进入坑道的第二天起，就和上级失掉了联系，但是报话员杨国兴总是想尽办法把它恢复起来。他冒着炮火冲出洞外插了二十多次天线杆。他怕电话机被炮震坏，整天把它抱在怀里。后来，他终于接通了与支队部的联系，他们听到了师团首长的指示和慰勉。十六日傍晚，传来了命令：在主力的炮火掩护下转移！战士们实在不愿离开这个光荣阵地，但是为了更有力地打击敌人，他们只好转移。三连连长李汉有带领一个组打开道路，副班长芮朝寿带领一个组反击山头上的敌人。由于全体同志发扬了坚忍不拔的精神与高度的阶级友爱，他们胜利完成了转移的任务，无一伤亡。
    荣誉属于英雄们
    高云和与他的全班英雄们，在一九○·八高地浴血苦战了五昼夜，消灭敌人四百多名，给主力部队创造了有利的作战条件，在争夺一九○·八高地战役中共歼敌二千四百余名、击毁坦克九辆，获得辉煌胜利。志愿军政治部以高云和班全体同志有功于祖国和世界和平事业，特给他们记特等功一次，并授给该班以“二级英雄班”的光荣称号；班长高云和获得“二级英雄”的荣誉，并记特等功一次。
