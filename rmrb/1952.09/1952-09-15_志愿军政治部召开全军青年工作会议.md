Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 14th: The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army convened the Second All-Army Youth Work Conference from August 28th to September 7th. The conference exchanged and summarized the experience of youth work throughout the army since July of last year and determined the tasks for future youth work.

Over the past year, under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's Volunteer Army at all levels, the youth work of the Volunteer Army has achieved more remarkable results. In the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the vast number of members of the Youth League and young soldiers in the army greatly improved their political awareness and played a highly active role in combat and various work tasks, becoming a powerful shock force. A large number of heroes, models, and people's meritorious workers have emerged from among them. According to incomplete statistics from January to June this year alone, 7,420 Youth League members in the army have been credited with meritorious service, accounting for more than 22% of the total number of people credited with meritorious service in the army.

"Make contributions for the motherland and the people! Avenge the Korean people!" "Strive to make international contributions and see Chairman Mao in Beijing!" have become the most powerful slogans inspiring young people to fight bravely and work actively. Zhang Xiangshan, a Youth League member of a certain unit, led a squad to repel 69 enemy attacks, killing or wounding more than 400 enemies. Wang Defu, a Youth League member of a certain unit, led a squad to kill or wound more than 500 enemies, and the entire squad was awarded a collective special-class merit. After being seriously wounded, Youth League member Cai Jintong lost contact with his unit but stubbornly crawled for a day and a night to return to his own unit, demonstrating the noble qualities of young people in the new China of being loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people. Many young soldiers have proposed to test themselves in battle, make contributions for the people, and strive to join the Youth League.

In the past year, the Youth League organizations in the Volunteer Army have not only developed greatly but have also become increasingly consolidated. The Youth League members have undergone severe tests in the war and have become a powerful assistant to the Party and the Party's most reliable, trained, and continuous reserve force. Currently, 20% of the personnel in the Volunteer Army are Youth League members, more than double the number from last year, and many outstanding Youth League members have joined the Chinese Communist Party. According to statistics from April to June this year, the number of Youth League members joining the Party accounted for more than 47% of the total number of new Party members. The Youth League organization has also cultivated a large number of squad and platoon cadres for the army, becoming a source of junior cadres. According to statistics from a certain unit, about a quarter of the newly promoted squad, platoon, and company cadres are Youth League members.

Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, gave specific instructions on the current youth work of the army at the meeting. He pointed out that the current tasks of youth work are: to continue to improve the patriotism and internationalism of the youth and to promote the revolutionary heroism of the youth, to carry out the work of making contributions and creating models more universally and deeply, requiring that wherever there are young people, there should be the heroic and exemplary role of young people; the Youth League organization must conduct education on communism and the Communist Party among the vast number of young people and all Youth League members in the army, and organize League members and the vast number of young soldiers to actively participate in cultural learning and recreational activities, so that Youth League members and young activists become the backbone of the army in carrying out cultural learning, improving military skills, and enlivening recreational life. Gan Siqi pointed out that the focus of youth work should be placed on the company level. The Youth League organization must, in the future, develop League members in a planned, prepared, and bold manner. It is required that every company has a sound Youth League branch, strengthens the construction of the company-level League branch, and constantly summarizes and exchanges work experience so that it can better play the role of the League.

    志愿军政治部召开全军青年工作会议
    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】中国人民志愿军政治部于八月二十八日至九月七日召开了全军第二届青年工作会议，交流和总结了自去年七月以来全军的青年工作经验，确定了今后青年工作的任务。
    一年来，在中国共产党志愿军各级党委的坚强领导下，志愿军全军的青年工作取得了更加显著的成绩。在伟大的抗美援朝战争中，全军中广大的青年团团员和青年战士大大提高了政治觉悟，在战斗和各种工作任务中发挥了高度的积极作用，成为一支有力的突击队，在他们之中涌现了大批的英雄模范和人民功臣。仅据今年一月至六月的不完全统计，全军中有七千四百二十名青年团员立了功，占全军立功总人数的百分之二十二以上。
    “为祖国人民立功、为朝鲜人民复仇！”“争取立国际功、到北京见毛主席！”已成为鼓舞青年们英勇作战和积极工作的最有力的口号。某部青年团员张像山曾带领一个班打退敌人六十九次进攻，杀伤敌人四百多名。某部青年团员王得福率领一个班杀伤敌人五百多名，全班因而荣立集体特等功。青年团员蔡金同负重伤后，与部队失去联系，仍顽强地爬行一天一夜回到自己的部队，表现了新中国青年忠于祖国，忠于人民的高尚品质。许多青年战士都提出要在战斗中考验自己，为人民建立功勋，争取参加青年团。
    一年来，志愿军中的青年团组织不仅有了极大的发展，并且日益巩固。青年团员们在战争中经受了严重的考验，已成为党的有力助手和党的最可靠的、经过锻炼的、源源不断的后备军。现在志愿军全军人员中有百分之二十是青年团员，比去年增加了两倍多，其中已有许多优秀的团员参加了中国共产党。据今年四月至六月三个月的统计，团员入党数占新党员总数的百分之四十七强。青年团组织又为部队培养了大量的班、排干部，成为初级干部的源泉。据某部统计，新提拔的班、排和连的干部约有四分之一以上是青年团团员。
    志愿军政治部主任甘泗淇在会上对全军当前的青年工作做了具体的指示。他指出当前青年工作的任务是：继续提高青年们的爱国主义和国际主义思想和发扬青年们的革命英雄主义精神，更加普遍地深入地开展立功创模工作，要求做到那里有青年，那里就有青年的英雄模范作用；青年团组织必须在全军广大青年和全体青年团员中进行关于共产主义和共产党的教育，并组织团员和广大青年战士积极参加文化学习与文娱活动，使青年团员和青年积极分子成为部队开展文化学习，提高军事技术与活跃文娱生活的骨干。甘泗淇指出青年工作的重心应该放在连队。青年团组织今后必须有计划地、有准备地、大胆地发展团员。要求每一个连队都有健全的青年团支部，加强连队团支部的建设，并不断总结与交流工作经验，使能更好地发挥团的作用。
