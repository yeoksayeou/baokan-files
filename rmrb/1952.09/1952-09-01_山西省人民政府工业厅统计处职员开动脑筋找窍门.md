    Staff of the Statistical Section of the Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Use Their Brains to Find Shortcuts
    To the Editor: All the staff of the Statistical Section of the Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government actively used their brains to find shortcuts and completed six months of comprehensive statistical reporting work in one and a half months, increasing efficiency by more than threefold.
    They mainly adopted the following three methods: 1. Each staff member worked in a planned and orderly manner. 2. Grasping the key points, focusing on lagging areas, and combining on-site supervision and assistance with on-the-spot review overcame the previous administrative procedures and saved time. 3. Appropriately allocating work according to each person's ability. In addition, they also found thirteen shortcuts in auditing methods, calculation methods, and other aspects. For example, fast division saved half the time compared to before; continuous addition and subtraction saved more than 80% of the time compared to before, greatly improving work efficiency.

    山西省人民政府工业厅统计处职员开动脑筋找窍门
    编辑同志：山西省人民政府工业厅统计处全体职员，积极开动脑筋找窍门，用一个半月的时间，完成了六个月的综合统计表报工作，效率提高三倍多。
    他们主要是采用下面三个方法：1、工作中每个工作人员都是有计划有规律地进行工作。2、抓住重点突击落后，下厂督促帮助，就地审查三者互相结合，这样就克服了以往的行文手续，节省了时间。3、按各个人的能力适当地分配工作。另外他们在审核方法，计算方法等方面，还找到了十三个窍门。如快速除法，较前节省了二分之一的时间；连续计算加减法，较前节省了百分之八十以上的时间，使工作效率大为提高。  白继承
