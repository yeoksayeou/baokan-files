In the past eight months, the Party's propaganda network has made new progress. According to recent incomplete statistics, there are now more than 2.92 million propagandists across the country, an increase of 1 million compared to the end of last year, representing an increase of more than one-third. North China and East China have the largest number of propagandists, with North China having more than 996,000 (including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) and East China having more than 855,000. In addition, Northeast China has more than 448,000, Central South China has more than 380,000, Southwest China has more than 158,000, and Northwest China has more than 85,000. The development of propagandists in North China and Northeast China is relatively widespread. The number of propagandists in North China has reached 1.4% of the region's population, and 80% to 90% of Party branches have established propagandists. The number of propagandists in Northeast China has reached more than 1% of the region's population, and 90% of Party branches have established propagandists. Along with the development of propagandists, the number of Party reporters has also increased somewhat. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 68,000 reporters across the country, an increase of more than 10,000 compared to the end of last year.

The development of the propaganda network in various regions has been carried out in conjunction with mass movements such as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, land reform, land reform review, increased production and frugality, and patriotic health campaigns. The newly developed propagandists and reporters are mostly activists who emerged during these movements. The addition of these activists to the Party's propaganda ranks has further strengthened the Party's propaganda forces and made the Party's mass propaganda work more active. Some local Party organizations, while developing the propaganda network, have also combined the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns and the land reform movement to rectify the propaganda network, purging a number of people with poor qualities and serious problems, and establishing and strengthening various leadership systems, thus further purifying and consolidating the Party's propaganda network. For example, in Chahar Province, the percentage of rural propaganda networks that can function regularly has increased from 20% last year to 34%, and the percentage of urban propaganda networks that can function regularly has increased from 30% last year to 60% to 70%. In Baoji Prefecture, Shaanxi, 60.6% of propagandists are active and proactive, 30.3% can carry out propaganda under the supervision of higher authorities, and only 9.1% are inactive. These facts show that the work of our Party's propaganda network has been greatly improved in many places in the past six months.

Propagandists and reporters in various regions have generally carried out a lot of work and played a positive role in mass movements such as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, patriotic production increase, land reform, land reform review, and patriotic health campaigns. For example, during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns in Chongqing, the Party's propagandists, as the backbone, organized a propaganda army of more than 10,000 people, conducted in-depth propaganda in factories, streets, and government agencies, enhanced the political consciousness of the masses, and powerfully promoted the city's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. The Laiyang Prefectural Committee of Shandong organized a huge propaganda team of 10,205 propagandists and 44,369 members of mass propaganda organizations on May 1st, launching extensive and in-depth propaganda, which greatly promoted the development of the patriotic production increase movement and the patriotic health movement. Driven by this propaganda, Laiyang County alone had 3,182 high-yield mutual aid teams, 598 high-yield households, and one agricultural production cooperative participating in the patriotic high-yield chain challenge. As of the beginning of July, reporters in Daxian Sub-district, Sichuan, had made 720 reports in the past six months, with an audience of 1,354,000 people. In Zhengyang County, Henan, when implementing the Ten Major Policies for Agricultural Production this summer, in order to crush the enemy's sabotage of production, the county-level and district-level reporters, under the personal leadership of Wang Dafu, the secretary of the county Party committee, and after careful planning, adopted the method of dividing areas and assigning responsibilities, launched a powerful county-wide propaganda offensive, quickly crushed the enemy's rumors, curbed the enemy's activities of inciting "fetching holy water" by using the masses' superstitious psychology, and stabilized the county's rural production order.

However, it should be pointed out that although the work of the Party's propaganda network has been greatly improved in the past six months, the propaganda network in many places is still very unsound. In these places, the Party committees rarely or do not pay attention to leading the work of the propaganda network, the various systems of the propaganda network have not been well established, the work of reporters and propagandists is not frequent, and some are even completely stagnated and exist in name only. There are many prominent examples in this regard. According to estimates in Yuanzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi, only 20% of the propagandists in the prefecture can truly function regularly, 60% are pushed to move, and 15% are completely ineffective or have impure elements. The work of propagandists in many places in the Southwest is also in a state of laissez-faire due to lack of leadership. Even in the old liberated areas in Northeast China, 25% of the propagandists established in Jilin Province cannot function, about 40% are "pushed to move," and only 30% are better. These facts show that the phenomenon of formalism in the work of propagandists is quite serious. The situation is even more serious in the work of reporters. For example, the report of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau stated that the work of reporters in the region is basically in a state of laissez-faire, becoming a relatively weak link in the work of the propaganda network. There are similar situations in the Southwest. In Northeast China, the activities of reporters are also not normal. For example, 63 reporters in Lushun-Dalian City and 63 reporters in the Northeast Railway System have not made a single report in the past six months. In this case, the existence of reporters is of course only a formality. Under this situation, how to strengthen the leadership of the work of the propaganda network, overcome the phenomenon of formalism, and enable reporters and propagandists to truly function regularly has obviously become a very important issue in the current work of the propaganda network.

Another problem that currently exists in the work of the propaganda network is that the development of the propaganda network is still very unbalanced. In some places, the development of the propaganda network is still very slow, and the number of reporters and propagandists is too small, which is far from meeting the needs of mass propaganda work. For example, there are more than 136 million people in the Central South Region, but there are only more than 380,000 propagandists in the region, which is less than 3 per thousand of the region's population. There are more than 70 million people in the Southwest Region, but there are only more than 150,000 propagandists, which is only more than 2 per thousand of the region's population. This is of course not enough. The weak foundation of the Party in these places is certainly the most important reason why the propaganda network cannot develop rapidly, but this is not the only reason. The lack of attention paid by some local Party committees to the establishment of the propaganda network is also an important reason for the slow development of the propaganda network. Xikang Province only developed 147 propagandists during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. Chengbu County in Hunan Province only formally developed three propagandists in one township until the end of May this year. These phenomena are of course not appropriate. Even in the old liberated areas, there are still many places where Party branches have not established propaganda networks until now. For example, Hebei Province is the province with the largest number of propagandists in the country, but Tongxian County in the province still has more than 30% of its branches without propagandists. The propagandists in the Subei Region are also relatively developed, but 60 of the 155 branches in Nantong County in the region have not established propagandists. Special attention should be paid to the fact that the propaganda network in industrial and mining enterprises is generally not developed enough. For example, Shanghai is a large city with a large concentration of industrial workers, but there are only 7,230 propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises in Shanghai. The propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises in Jilin City account for only 2.5% of the total number of employees. This situation is of course not commensurate with the requirements put forward by the ongoing large-scale industrial production increase and frugality campaign and the upcoming large-scale national construction for propaganda work. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen and develop the propaganda network in industrial and mining enterprises, otherwise it will not be able to meet the needs.

The above is the basic situation of the current propaganda network work. Based on this situation, the main tasks in the propaganda network work in the future are to continue to strengthen and consolidate the propaganda network, strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels over the propaganda network, conscientiously establish and implement various systems of the propaganda network, strive to make reporters and propagandists play a universal role, and make their work regular; at the same time, the propaganda network should be further developed on the existing basis, and special attention should be paid to strengthening the construction of the propaganda network in industrial and mining enterprises.

In order to further strengthen and consolidate the work of the propaganda network, all regions should conduct a general inspection and rectification of the work of the propaganda network in the second half of this year in conjunction with the central work of the local area. The main purpose of the inspection and rectification should be to summarize experiences and establish and strengthen various leadership systems. Some model propagandists should be commended so that everyone can learn from them. Special emphasis should be placed on summarizing the experience of Party committees at the county and district levels in leading the work of the propaganda network, promoting successful experiences, and giving strict criticism to county and district Party committees that do not pay attention to the work of the propaganda network. The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee has recently achieved good experience in rectifying and developing the propaganda network in conjunction with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. Their main method is to closely integrate with the central work, and under the unified leadership and careful planning of the Party committee, mobilize all parties to carry out this work together. As a result, not only has the work of the propaganda network been further consolidated and soundly developed, but it has also directly promoted the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. This experience is worth learning from.

In order to further improve the political level and working ability of propagandists, in addition to giving help to propagandists through propagandist meetings and dissemination stations, all regions should strive to universally train propagandists within a certain period of time by running short-term training classes, spare-time training classes, or by combining the training of propagandists in general worker-peasant activist training classes. Many regions already have plans to universally train propagandists, and these plans should be conscientiously implemented. Now the propagandists in various regions generally feel that they lack knowledge and are struggling to improve themselves. Therefore, how to help propagandists constantly improve their level has become a very urgent issue. As for the main method of strengthening the work of reporters, it is to establish a system in which reporters make reports on time and relatively fix the reporting objects and divide responsibilities. Party committees should regularly check the work of reporters, give strict criticism to reporters who fail to perform their duties without reason, and commend reporters who do good work. Party committees should prescribe reporting topics on time and provide reporting materials as much as possible, which can also urge reporters to perform their duties.

In terms of continuing to develop the propaganda network, first, in the rural areas of the Central South, Southwest, Northwest, and some new districts of East China, the propaganda network should be developed in conjunction with the work of rectifying and building the Party and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas, so that the number of propagandists in these areas will gradually reach 1% of the total population. In the old liberated areas of Northeast China, North China, and some parts of East China, efforts should be made to universally establish propagandists in the original branches and the newly established branches in the future, so that the number of propagandists will exceed 1% of the total population of the region. Second, special attention should be paid to establishing and developing propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises, basic construction units, and mutual aid and cooperative organizations in rural areas. Basic construction is the focus of large-scale economic construction in the future, and we should attach great importance to developing the Party's mass propaganda work in basic construction units. In rural areas, establishing propagandists in mutual aid and cooperation should be regarded as the focus of the work of the propaganda network, and efforts should be made to establish Party propagandists in every mutual aid team and every agricultural production cooperative to strengthen the Party's political propaganda in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In factories and mines, propagandists should be fully developed, and the number of propagandists should reach about 10% of the total number of employees, so that every workshop and group has propagandists. Third, the number of reporters is still very small at present, and it cannot meet the needs of propaganda work. All regions should pay attention to continue to develop. Reporters should be universally established in Party committees above the district level and in industrial and mining enterprises with a large number of people.

Party committees at all levels should formulate specific plans for developing and strengthening the work of propagandists and reporters, and resolutely implement these plans. Only by continuously strengthening the work of the Party's propaganda network can we build our mass propaganda work on a solid foundation and make it catch up with the needs of the rapidly developing national construction work.

### 全国宣传网工作的目前情况及今后努力的目标

    全国宣传网工作的目前情况及今后努力的目标
    在过去八个月中，党的宣传网工作又有了新的发展。据最近不完全统计，全国一共有宣传员二百九十二万多人，较去年底增加了一百万人，即增加了三分之一以上。宣传员的数目以华北和华东为最多，华北是九十九万六千多人（包括内蒙自治区），华东是八十五万五千多人。此外，东北是四十四万八千多人，中南是三十八万多人，西南是十五万八千多人，西北是八万五千多人。其中华北和东北宣传员的发展较普遍，华北的宣传员已达全区人口的百分之一点四，已有百分之八十至九十的党支部建立了宣传员；东北的宣传员已达全区人口的百分之一强，已有百分之九十的党支部建立了宣传员。和宣传员的发展同时，党的报告员的数目也有了一些增加，据不完全统计，现在全国共有报告员六万八千多人，比去年年底增加了一万多人。
    各地发展宣传网的工作都是结合着“三反”“五反”、土地改革、土地改革复查、增产节约及爱国卫生等群众运动进行的，新发展的宣传员、报告员也多是这些运动中涌现出的积极分子，由于这些积极分子加入到党的宣传队伍中来，就进一步增强了党的宣传队伍，使党的群众宣传工作更加活跃起来。有些地方党的组织，在发展宣传网的同时，并结合“三反”“五反”运动及土地改革运动，对宣传网进行了整顿，清洗了一批品质不好、有严重问题的分子，建立和加强了各种领导制度，因而使得党的宣传网进一步纯洁和巩固起来。例如察哈尔省的农村宣传网能经常起作用的已由去年的百分之二十增加为百分之三十四，城市宣传网能经常起作用的已由去年的百分之三十增至百分之六十至七十。陕西宝鸡专区全区能主动积极进行宣传的已占百分之六十点六，在上级领导督促下能宣传的占百分之三十点三，不起作用的仅占百分之九点一。这些事实表明，我们党的宣传网工作在过去半年多中在很多地方已有很大的改进。
    各地宣传员、报告员在“三反”“五反”、爱国增产、土地改革、土地改革复查、爱国卫生等群众运动中一般都进行了很多工作，起了积极的作用。例如重庆市在“三反”“五反”运动中，以党的宣传员为骨干，组织了万人以上的宣传大军，分别在工厂、街道、机关中进行了深入宣传，提高了群众的政治觉悟，有力地推动了该市“三反”“五反”运动。山东莱阳地委在“五一”节组成了一支有一万零二百零五名宣传员和四万四千三百六十九名群众宣传组织成员的庞大宣传队伍，展开了广泛和深入的宣传，对开展爱国丰产运动和爱国卫生运动起了极大的推动作用。经过这次宣传的推动，仅莱阳一县即有三千一百八十二个丰产互助组、五百九十八个丰产户、一个农业生产合作社投入爱国丰产连环挑战。四川达县分区报告员至七月初为止的半年来共作报告七百二十次，听众达一百三十五万四千人。河南正阳县在今夏贯彻农业生产十大政策时，为了粉碎敌特破坏生产的活动，县级和区级报告员在县委书记王达夫亲自领导下，经过周密计划，采取了划片包干的办法，展开了全县性的强大宣传攻势，很快粉碎了敌人谣言，遏止了敌人利用群众迷信心理煽动“取圣水”的活动，稳定了该县农村生产秩序。
    但是应该指出，在过去半年多中，党的宣传网工作虽然已有很大的改进，但是也还有很多地方的宣传网工作仍然很不健全。在这些地方，党委很少或者根本不注意去领导宣传网工作，宣传网的各种制度没有很好建立起来，报告员和宣传员的工作很不经常，有的甚至完全陷于停顿，形同虚设。在这方面有很多突出的例子。据江西袁州专区估计，该区宣传员能真正经常起作用的只占百分之二十强，推一下动一下的占百分之六十，百分之十五强是根本不起作用或成分不纯的。西南很多地方的宣传员工作也由于缺乏领导，多半成为自流状态。甚至在东北老区也有这种情形，如吉林全省已建立的宣传员中有百分之二十五不能起作用，有百分之四十左右是“推一推动一动”，较好的只有百分之三十。这些事实说明，宣传员工作中的形式主义现象相当严重。报告员工作中有着更加严重的情形。例如中南局宣传部的报告说，该区报告员工作基本上陷于自流状态，成为宣传网工作中比较薄弱的一环。西南也有类似情形。在东北，报告员的活动也不够正常，如旅大市的六十三名报告员和东北铁路系统的六十三名报告员半年来都是一次报告也未作过。这样，报告员的存在当然只是形式。在这种情形下，如何加强对宣传网工作的领导，克服形式主义的现象，使报告员、宣传员真正能够经常地起作用，显然已成为目前宣传网工作中的一个十分重要的问题了。
    目前宣传网工作中所存在着的另一个问题，就是宣传网的发展还很不平衡，在有些地方宣传网的发展还非常缓慢，报告员、宣传员的数量太少，还远不能适应群众宣传工作需要。例如中南区有一亿三千六百多万人口，但现在全区只有宣传员三十八万多人，还不到全区人口千分之三，西南区七千多万人口，现在只有宣传员十五万多人，只到全人口的千分之二强。这当然是不够的。这些地方党的基础比较薄弱，当然是宣传网不能迅速发展的最主要原因，但这并不是唯一的原因。有些地方党委对建立宣传网工作不够重视，也是宣传网发展缓慢的一个重要原因。西康全省在“三反”“五反”运动中只发展了一百四十七个宣传员，湖南省城步县直至今年五月底才仅在一个乡内形式主义地发展了三个宣传员，这些现象当然是不应该的。甚至在老区，也有很多有党的支部的地方一直到现在还未建立宣传网，例如河北省是全国宣传员数量最大的省份，但该省通县现在尚有百分之三十以上的支部没有建立宣传员。苏北区的宣传员也是比较发展的，但该区南通全县一百五十五个支部中，有六十个支部尚未建立宣传员。特别需要注意的是工矿企业中宣传网一般都还发展得很不够。例如上海是一个产业工人大量集中的大城市，但现在全上海工矿企业中的宣传员总共才不过七千二百三十人。吉林市工矿企业中的宣传员只占职工总数百分之二点五。这种情形当然是和正在进行的大规模的工业增产节约运动以及即将到来的大规模国家建设对于宣传工作所提出的要求不相称的。因此必须进一步加强和发展工矿企业中的宣传网工作，否则即无法适应需要。
    以上就是目前宣传网工作的基本情况。根据这种情况，今后宣传网工作方面的主要任务，就是要继续加强和巩固宣传网，加强各级党委对宣传网的领导，认真建立和实行宣传网的各项制度，努力使报告员、宣传员普遍发生作用，并使他们的工作经常化；同时，应在现有基础上使宣传网获得更进一步的发展，尤其要注意加强工矿企业部门的宣传网建设。
    为了进一步加强和巩固宣传网的工作，各地应于今年下半年内结合当地中心工作对宣传网工作普遍进行一次检查和整顿。检查和整顿的目的，主要应该是总结经验，建立和加强各种领导制度。应该表扬一些模范的宣传员，让大家向他们学习。应当特别着重总结县区一级党委领导宣传网工作的经验，把成功的经验加以推广，对于不重视宣传网工作的县区党委应给以严格的批评。天津市委在最近一次结合“三反”“五反”运动整顿和发展宣传网的工作中已取得了很好的经验。他们的主要方法就是紧密结合中心工作，在党委统一领导和周密计划下，动员各方面力量共同进行这一工作。他们这样做的结果，不但使宣传网工作获得了进一步的巩固和健全的发展，而且也直接地推动了“三反”“五反”运动。这一经验值得大家学习。
    为了进一步普遍提高宣传员的政治水平和工作能力，除了通过宣传员会议，传授站给宣传员以帮助外，各地都应争取在一定时间内用开办短期训练班、业余训练班的办法，或用在一般工人农民积极分子训练班内兼带训练宣传员的办法，把宣传员普遍加以训练。各地多已有普遍训练宣传员的计划，这些计划应认真实行起来。现在各地宣传员一般都感到本钱少，苦于无法提高自己，因此如何帮助宣传员不断地提高他们的水平，已成为一个十分急切的问题。至于加强报告员工作的主要办法就是建立报告员按时作报告和相对地固定报告对象、分工负责的制度。党委应当经常检查报告员的工作，对于无故不履行自己的职责的报告员应给以严格的批评，并表扬工作好的报告员。党委应当按时规定报告题目，并尽可能供给报告材料，这样也可督促报告员履行自己的职责。
    在继续发展宣传网方面，第一，在中南、西南、西北和华东的一部分新区的农村，应该结合农村的整党建党工作和互助合作运动去发展宣传网，逐渐地使这些地区的宣传员的数目达到总人口的百分之一。在东北、华北及华东的一部分老区，应该争取在原有的支部及今后建党中新建立起的支部中普遍建立起宣传员来，争取使宣传员的数目超过全区人口的百分之一。第二，应当特别注意在工矿企业、基本建设单位和农村的互助合作组织中建立和发展宣传员。基本建设是今后大规模经济建设的重点，我们应当十分重视在基本建设单位中发展党的群众宣传工作。在农村中，应当把在互助合作中建立宣传员当作宣传网工作的重点，要争取在每一个互助组，每一个农业生产合作社中都建立起党的宣传员，以加强党在互助合作组织中的政治宣传。在工厂矿山中，应使宣传员达到充分的发展，宣传员的数目应达到全体职工的百分之十左右，使每一个车间和小组中都有宣传员的活动。第三，目前报告员的数量还很少，还不能适应宣传工作的需要，各地应当注意继续发展。应在区以上的党委及人数较多的工矿企业单位中普遍建立起报告员来。
    各级党委都应当定出发展和加强宣传员、报告员工作的具体计划来，并把这些计划坚决付之实现。只有不断地加强党的宣传网工作，才能把我们的群众宣传工作建立在一个巩固的基础上，并使它赶上国家建设工作迅速发展的需要。
