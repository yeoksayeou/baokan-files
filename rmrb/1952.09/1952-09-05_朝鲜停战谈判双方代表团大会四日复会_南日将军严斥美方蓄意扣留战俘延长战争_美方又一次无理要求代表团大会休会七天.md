Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th. At the plenary session of the delegations from both sides of the Korean armistice talks on the 4th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out that the draft armistice agreement has been fully agreed upon. As long as the prisoner-of-war lists are corrected and prisoners of war are repatriated in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention and the prisoner-of-war repatriation clauses of the draft armistice agreement, an armistice can be reached. However, the other side fabricated the lie that prisoners of war are unwilling to return home, attempting to send a large number of prisoners of war to the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs as cannon fodder, deliberately prolonging and increasingly expanding the war. The people of the world have long seen the true face of the warmongers on the other side who arbitrarily massacre prisoners of war and indiscriminately bomb women and children. The other side is sacrificing the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers from more than a dozen countries and destroying the happiness of peace-loving people, all for the benefit of a handful of arms dealers and war profiteers. General Nam Il sternly pointed out that the other side must bow to humanity and international law, and on the basis of the principle of repatriating prisoners of war to their homes to live peaceful lives, negotiate a solution to the prisoner-of-war issue that should have been resolved long ago, and achieve an armistice in Korea. Otherwise, the other side must bear the responsibility for prolonging the war and all the consequences arising therefrom. The other side then once again suggested a one-week recess, with the resumption of the meeting on September 12.

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会四日复会
    南日将军严斥美方蓄意扣留战俘延长战争
    美方又一次无理要求代表团大会休会七天
    【新华社开城四日电】四日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：停战协定草案已经全部达成协议，只要根据一九四九年日内瓦公约和停战协定草案遣俘条款，校正战俘名单，遣返战俘，就可以达成停战。但对方捏造战俘不愿回家的谎言，企图将大批战俘送交李承晚、蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰，故意延长并日益扩大战争。世界人民早已看清了对方好战分子恣意屠杀战俘、滥炸妇女儿童的真面目。对方只是为了一小撮军火商人和战争贩子的利益，不惜葬送对方十余个国家千万士兵的生命，毁灭和平人民的幸福。南日将军严词指出：对方必须向人道和国际法低头，在遣返战俘回家过和平生活的原则基础上，协商解决早就应该解决的战俘问题，实现朝鲜停战。否则对方就必须担负延长战争及由此而产生的一切后果的责任。对方继即又一次建议休会一周，到九月十二日复会。
