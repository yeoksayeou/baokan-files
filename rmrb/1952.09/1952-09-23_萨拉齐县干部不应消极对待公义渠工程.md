    Sarachi County Cadres Should Not Be Passive Towards the Gongyi Canal Project
    To the Editor: There is a Gongyi Canal in Suiyuan Province, which can irrigate 800,000 mu of farmland (including 500,000 mu in Jungar Banner, 200,000 mu in Tokto County, and 100,000 mu in Sarachi County). This spring, the provincial agricultural and animal husbandry production conference decided to repair this canal; the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau immediately consulted with the relevant banners and counties to determine all the measures for surveying, design, and construction.
    On April 1st, Jungar Banner, Sarachi, and Tokto established a "Works Office" responsible for organizing laborers and supplying materials, grain, and other necessities. The director was Comrade Bai Qingyuan, Deputy Banner Chief of Jungar Banner. It was originally stipulated that half of the cadres below the director should be provided by Sarachi and Tokto, and half by Jungar Banner, but Sarachi only sent an assistant from the district, and Tokto sent an armed forces minister from the district. The remaining twenty-odd cadres had to be provided by Jungar Banner.
    The Gongyi Canal's drainage line was originally decided to flow into the Dahei River through Taipingzhuang in Sarachi, but Taipingzhuang objected, and the cadres of Sarachi County followed suit. After negotiation, it was decided to change it to flow into the Dahei River from Lusangedui Village in Sarachi. After construction began, Lusangedui Village objected again. Zhao, the head of the construction department in Sarachi, not only failed to persuade and educate the masses but also launched a mass signature campaign (Zhao himself also signed) in opposition, and proposed an exchange condition. In the end, the Works Office had to agree to extract 50 million yuan from the canal construction fee to build a secondary dike for the Dahei River for Lusangedui Village, and only then was the drainage line fixed, but seven days of work and 50,000 cubic meters of earthwork were wasted.
    The water intake line of the Gongyi Canal was originally agreed upon with the local masses to flow into the old Gongyi Canal from Yinjiangyaozi Village and two other villages. After the surveying was completed, the masses in the third district of Sarachi objected, so the line had to be changed, resulting in six more days of work and 30,000 more cubic meters of earthwork.
    The water intake gate of the Gongyi Canal is located within the territory of the third district of Sarachi. Reed roots from the third district or *Achnatherum splendens* from the fourth district could have been obtained nearby to make the gate material. The Works Office repeatedly asked Sarachi to supply it, but Sarachi only agreed to supply unusable reeds. The Works Office had no choice but to transport *Achnatherum splendens* from the desert area two hundred miles away to make the gate material.
    The cadres of Sarachi County and some of the masses believe that the Gongyi Canal does not irrigate a large area of their county, so they have adopted these erroneous practices. In principle, this is parochialism. The result is that national construction has suffered losses. It is hoped that the leaders of Sarachi and the relevant cadres will conduct self-criticism and make a review in the newspaper.

### 萨拉齐县干部不应消极对待公义渠工程

    萨拉齐县干部不应消极对待公义渠工程
    编辑同志：绥远省有条公义渠，可灌溉八十万亩田（包括准格尔旗的五十万亩，托克托县的二十万亩，萨拉齐县的十万亩）。今春全省农、牧业生产会议决定补修这条渠；省水利局当即和有关旗、县商定了测量、设计、施工中的一切办法。
    准格尔旗和萨拉齐、托克托在四月一日成立了“工务所”，负责组织民工，供应材料、粮食等工作。所长由准格尔旗副旗长白庆元同志担任。所长以下干部，原规定萨拉齐、托克托出一半，准格尔旗出一半，但萨拉齐只派来一个区助理员，托克托派来一个区武装部长，其余二十几个干部只好由准格尔旗供给。
    公义渠的退水线原决定经萨拉齐太平庄流入大黑河，但太平庄反对，萨拉齐县的干部跟着也反对。后经洽商决定改自萨拉齐路三圪堆村流入大黑河。施工以后，路三圪堆村又提出反对。萨拉齐建设科赵科长不但不向群众进行说服教育，反而发动群众签名
    （赵自己也签了名）反对，并提出交换条件。最后工务所只好答应在修渠工程费中抽出五千万元给路三圪堆村，修筑大黑河副堤，这才定了退水线，可是已浪费了七天功夫和多挖了五万公方土方。
    公义渠的进水线原与当地群众议定，由银匠窑子村等三村流入旧公义渠。测量完工后，萨拉齐三区群众反对，只好改线，结果多费了六天功夫，多挖了三万公方的土方。
    公义渠的进水闸在萨拉齐三区境内，本可就近取得三区的芦根或四区的白茨做闸料，工务所几次要求萨拉齐供应，但萨拉齐只答应供给不能用的芦苇。工务所只好到二百里以外的沙漠地区去采运白茨来做闸料。
    萨拉齐县的干部和某些群众认为公义渠对本县灌溉面积不大，所以采取了这些错误作法。提到原则上来说，就是闹本位主义。其结果是使国家建设受到损失。希望萨拉齐领导方面和有关干部进行自我批评，并在报上检讨。    草央
