Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 23rd: People from all walks of life in Korea continue to express their enthusiastic support for the convocation of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    Li Huanqi, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, representing all Korean youth, expressed his warm support for the convocation of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. He said: At a time when the American and British imperialists are attempting to expand the war of aggression against Korea, we, the Korean youth and all the Korean people, are filled with anger, determined to win the victory of the great Fatherland Liberation War, and continue to defend peace in Asia and the world. Li Huanqi called on Korean youth to further arm themselves with patriotism and internationalism, and to fight to the end for the sacred cause of safeguarding peace in Asia.
    Musician Li Mianxiang said: We literary and art workers actively support the sending of representatives by our Korean people to participate in the Peace Conference. We will expose more clearly to the people of the world the various atrocities committed by the American troops in Korea. We are determined to further strengthen friendship and solidarity with the people of Asia and all peace-loving people in the world, and completely shatter the sinister aggressive schemes of American imperialism. With the strong support and solidarity of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various People's Democratic countries, we will resolutely defend the independence and freedom of our motherland and make greater contributions to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia.
    Kim Chang-joon, Chairman of the South Korean Christian Democratic League, sternly condemned the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors in slaughtering the Korean people, wantonly bombing peaceful cities and towns, and using bacteriological weapons, trampling on human morality and international conventions. Kim Chang-joon said: It is of great significance to convene the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference at this time. This conference will surely unite the forces of the broad masses of people in the Asia and Pacific regions to defend peace, and deal a heavy blow to the imperialists who are carrying out wars of aggression in Asia.
    Kim Gui-seon, principal writer of the "Korean Women" magazine, said in a statement: A peaceful settlement of the Korean question has become the most pressing task for peace defenders at present. Therefore, Korean women and progressive women all over the world welcome the convening of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We are confident that the achievements of the Peace Conference will further encourage the struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace. Kim Gui-seon called on all Korean women to firmly unite around General Kim Il-sung and the government of the Republic, create more brilliant labor achievements on the front and in the rear, and strive for greater victories in the cause of opposing aggression and defending peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The Preparatory Committee of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has received a congratulatory letter from the Japanese Artists' Peace Forum congratulating the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The letter said: At a time when all good people in the world feel the danger of war and universally demand peace, the convocation of the Asia and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is a matter of utmost excitement for us Japanese artists. In the past, Japanese artists failed to resist the brutal acts committed by the Japanese militarists against millions of people in Asian countries, and some even cooperated with these acts. Reflecting on this, we must first apologize to you. The letter continued: Although only seven years have passed since the end of the war, the traitors have sold out our motherland to American imperialism as a military base, attempting to once again challenge the people of Asia from here. Under the rule of these warmongers, Japanese artists are suffering. However, the awakened Japanese artists have recognized the ambition of American imperialism and are carrying out the struggle to defend peace together with the Japanese people. We know that without the support of all peace forces in the Asian region, led by the Soviet Union and China, our strength cannot carry out this struggle. Therefore, we deeply feel the significance of this Peace Conference. We firmly believe that the achievements of this conference will shatter the ambition of American imperialism, which is trampling on all international agreements, attempting to invade Asia, and is sharpening its claws in Korea, and will become a great force in establishing lasting peace in Asia. We look forward to the achievements of this conference and vow to further promote the struggle for peace on the basis of the success of the conference.

    朝鲜各界人士和日本美术家拥护和平会议
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜各界人士继续发表言论热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会副委员长李焕起代表全朝鲜青年表示热烈支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。他说：在美英帝国主义者企图扩大侵朝战争的时候，我们朝鲜青年和全朝鲜人民都愤怒万分，决心争取伟大的祖国解放战争的胜利，继续保卫亚洲与世界的和平。李焕起号召朝鲜青年进一步以爱国主义和国际主义思想武装起来，为维护亚洲和平的神圣事业而奋斗到底。
    音乐家李冕相说：我们文学艺术工作者积极拥护我们朝鲜人民派遣代表参加和平会议。我们要在全世界人民面前把美国军队在朝鲜制造的种种暴行，更加清楚地揭露出来。我们决心进一步加强与亚洲人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的友谊团结，彻底粉碎美帝国主义凶恶的侵略阴谋。在苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民的大力支持与声援之下，我们必将坚决保卫祖国的独立、自由，在捍卫亚洲和平的事业上作出更大的贡献。
    南朝鲜基督教徒民主联盟委员长金昌俊严正斥责了美国侵略者屠杀朝鲜人民、滥炸和平城乡以及使用细菌武器等蹂躏人类道德和国际公约的血腥暴行。金昌俊说：在这个时候召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，意义是十分重大的。这个会议必将把亚洲及太平洋区域广大人民保卫和平的力量团结起来，给予在亚洲进行侵略战争的帝国主义者以沉重的打击。
    “朝鲜妇女”杂志社主笔金贵善发表谈话说：和平解决朝鲜问题业已成为和平保卫者当前最迫切的任务，因此，朝鲜妇女和全世界进步妇女，都欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。我们确信和平会议的成就必将进一步鼓舞各国人民捍卫和平的斗争。金贵善号召全朝鲜妇女坚强团结在金日成将军和共和国政府的周围，在前后方创造更光辉的劳动业迹，在反对侵略、保卫和平的事业上争取更大的胜利。
    【新华社二十三日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会顷收到日本美术家和平恳谈会祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的一封贺信。贺信说：当此全世界善良的人们感到战争的危险，普遍要求和平的时候，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，对我们日本美术家来说，是一件无上兴奋的事情。日本美术家过去对于日本军阀对亚洲各国数百万人民所进行的残暴行为未能进行抵抗，一部分人甚至还有和这种行为合作的罪过，我们反省此点，首先要向您们道歉。贺信接着说：虽然战争结束只不过七年，但是，卖国贼已把我们的祖国出卖给美帝国主义作为军事基地，企图再次从这里向亚洲人民挑战。在这些战争贩子的统治下，日本的美术家们正在蒙受苦难。然而，已经觉醒了的日本美术家们已认清了美帝国主义的这种野心，而和日本人民共同进行着保卫和平的斗争。我们知道：如果没有以苏联、中国为首的亚洲区域所有和平力量的支持，我们的力量就不能进行这个斗争。因此我们深感此次和平会议意义的重大。我们坚信：这次会议的成就将粉碎那个蹂躏一切国际协定、企图侵略亚洲、正在朝鲜磨擦魔爪的美帝国主义的野心，而成为在亚洲建立永久和平的伟大力量。我们期待这次会议的成就，并誓将在会议成功的基础上，更进一步推进和平的斗争。
