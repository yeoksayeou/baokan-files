    Can elementary school teachers still study at higher normal schools?
    Question: Can elementary school teachers who have already graduated from normal schools still study at higher normal schools?
    Answer: Elementary school teachers who have graduated from normal schools (or high schools) or have equivalent qualifications, and have been employed for two years, may be recommended by the local government to designated normal schools or normal colleges for study, in accordance with the conditions and procedures stipulated by the Central Government for selecting elementary school teachers to study at higher normal schools. They do not need to go through the general entrance examination when entering the school, but they still need to pass a certain test. If they wish to further their studies and have been approved by the local government, but have not been recommended, they can also register and take the entrance examination for normal colleges or normal colleges on their own. The examination method is the same as the general entrance examination.

    小学教员是否还可以入高等师范学校学习？
    问：已在师范学校毕业的小学教员，是否还可以入高等师范学校学习？
    答：原师范学校（或高中）毕业或具有相当程度的小学教员，任职满二年者，当地政府得根据中央规定的选送小学教师入高等师范学校学习的条件及手续，保送到指定的师范学校或师范专科学校学习。入校时不必经过一般的入学考试，但仍须经过一定的测验。如志愿升学而经当地政府批准，但未获得保送者，亦可自行报名投考师范学院或师范专科学校。其考试办法和一般入学考试相同。
