    Zhedang Township Peasants Greet the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference by Ensuring a Bumper Harvest
    Editor: We were very happy to hear that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be held in Beijing.

    During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, our Zhedang Township in Jintan County suffered severe devastation by the Japanese invaders. Many kind people were shot and killed by the Japanese devils, and thousands of dan of grain were looted. The number of families who were forced to be broken and scattered is countless.

    Since liberation, especially after the land reform, a new atmosphere has emerged here. Farmers not only have land to cultivate and food to eat, but also have the opportunity to go to school, and they are in the mood to sing and dance. This year, thanks to the patriotic production increase campaign and further organization, the crops in the fields are expected to have another bumper harvest, and you can appreciate the joyful mood of the people.

    However, American imperialism is stepping up the arming of Japan and trying every possible means to delay and expand the aggressive war in Korea. This seriously threatens the peace of the Asian and Pacific regions and endangers our bright future. Under this tense situation, it is absolutely necessary to convene the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to further unite the people of all countries and jointly stop the forces of aggression. Therefore, we have decided to greet the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with practical actions. We guarantee: (1) To widely publicize the significance and role of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference through various meetings and using methods such as reading newspapers and blackboard newspapers, so that all the people in the township know it and strive to implement the resolutions of the conference. (2) To mobilize all the farmers in the township to pull out withered seedlings, eliminate rice borers, collect egg masses, and do a good job in flood and wind prevention to ensure a bumper harvest in autumn.

    (3) To continue and persistently carry out the patriotic health campaign, requiring thorough cleaning, clean water use, everyone to swat flies, and every household to eliminate rats.
    Chen Xiaoru, Propaganda Officer of Zhedang Township, Jintan County, Southern Jiangsu, and others

### 柘荡乡农民以确保丰收来迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议

    柘荡乡农民以确保丰收来迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    编辑同志：我们听到将要在北京举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的消息，心里非常高兴。
    在八年抗日战争中，我们金坛县柘荡乡受日寇的摧残破坏是很严重的。许多善良的人民被日本鬼子枪杀了，几千担粮食被抢劫了，至于被迫得家破人亡、妻离子散的人家更是数不胜数。
    解放以后，特别是土地改革以后，我们这里已出现了一片新气象。农民不仅有地种，有饭吃，而且有机会进学校，也有心情唱歌和跳舞了。今年由于开展了爱国增产竞赛和进一步组织起来，地里的作物眼望又要丰收了，人们欢乐的情绪，你们是可以体会得到的。
    但是美帝国主义却在加紧武装日本，千方百计地企图拖延与扩大在朝鲜的侵略战争。这样便严重地威胁着亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，危害着我们美好的前途。在这种紧张的局势下，召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，进一步团结各国人民，共同制止侵略势力是完全必要的。因此我们决定以实际行动来迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。我们保证：（一）通过各种会议，运用读报、黑板报等方法，广泛地宣传亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的意义和作用，务使全乡人民家喻户晓，为实现大会的决议而奋斗。（二）发动全乡农民拔枯心苗，扑螟蛾，采卵块，做好防汛、防风等工作，确保秋季丰收。
    （三）将继续持久地开展爱国卫生运动，要求打扫干净，用水清洁，人人扑蝇，户户灭鼠。
    苏南金坛县柘荡乡宣传员  陈孝汝等
