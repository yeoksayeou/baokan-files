Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 7th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, after hearing the government's report on the Soviet government's note to the Western Three Powers on September 5th, passed a resolution upon the suggestion of various parties, stating: "The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on August 23rd of this year once again put forward new and specific proposals for resolving all issues related to Germany, especially advocating the convening of a Four-Power Conference before October of this year. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic believes that despite the rejection of all previous proposals to the Bonn Federal Parliament, extending a hand to the Bonn Federal Parliament again is its responsibility to the motherland. Every German knows that the Soviet government's proposal for representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the West German Federal Republic to jointly discuss various issues conforms to the German people's right to self-determination and creates the possibility of concluding a just peace treaty. There is no doubt whatsoever that if the German people themselves reach an agreement on sending representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the West German Federal Republic to participate in the Four-Power Conference and agree on the conditions for holding free all-German elections, it will greatly facilitate the achievement of mutual understanding among the four major powers."

The People's Chamber resolution denounced the war-like "General Treaty" imposed on West Germany by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, saying: "The war-like 'General Treaty' seriously threatens the survival and future of the German people, and threatens the peace and security of peace-loving people throughout Europe. That is why the German people demand the rejection of the war-like 'General Treaty' and demand the holding of a Four-Power Conference."

The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic elected a delegation, including members of parliament such as Mahtun, Nusheke, Hiemann, Hormann, and Godenburgm; and ordered this delegation to deliver a letter to the Presidium of the West German Federal Parliament and to Chairman Ellers himself, containing various proposals to all members of the West German Federal Parliament.

The People's Chamber also authorized this delegation: If the members of the West German Federal Parliament express their readiness to reach mutual understanding, the delegation can conduct the necessary negotiations on the issue of sending representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the West German Federal Republic to participate in the Four-Power Conference, as well as on all detailed methods for organizing an investigation team to determine the conditions for holding all-German elections. The People's Chamber resolution emphasized that in order not to waste any more time and to facilitate the reunification of Germany, the organization of this investigation team should be accelerated.

    民主德国人民议会决派代表团与西德谈判
    建议就参加四国会议和组织调查团问题获致互相谅解
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国人民议会于九月五日听取了政府就苏联政府致西方三国政府照会所作的报告之后，在各党派的建议下，通过一项决议，决议说：“苏联政府于今年八月二十三日致美、英、法三国政府的照会，再度就解决有关德国的一切问题提出了新的具体建议，特别是主张在今年十月以前召开四国会议。德意志民主共和国人民议会认为：尽管它过去向波恩联邦议会提出的一切建议都遭到拒绝，再度对波恩联邦议会伸出手来，是它对祖国应尽的责任。每一个德国人都知道：苏联政府提出的由德意志民主共和国和西德联邦共和国的代表共同讨论各种问题的建议，是符合德国人民的自决权利的，并且创造了缔结公正的和约的可能。无论如何不容怀疑的是：如果德国人民自己就派遣德意志民主共和国和西德联邦共和国的代表参加四国会议一事取得协议，并且就确定举行全德自由选举的条件取得协议，将大大有利于四大国间互相谅解的获致。”
    人民议会决议斥责美、英、法三国政府强加于西德的战争性的“一般性条约”说：“战争性的‘一般性条约’严重地威胁着德国人民的生存和前途，威胁着全欧洲爱好和平的人民的和平与安全。这就是为什么德国人民要求拒绝战争性的‘一般性条约’，而要求举行四国会议的原因。”
    德意志民主共和国人民议会选出一个代表团，其中包括马吞、努舍克、海曼、荷曼和戈登堡姆等议员；并命令这个代表团把一封信送交西德联邦议会主席团和主席爱勒斯博士本人，信中对西德联邦议会的全体议员提出了各项建议。
    人民议会并且授权这个代表团：假如西德联邦议会的议员们表示准备获致互相谅解，代表团即可就派遣德意志民主共和国和西德联邦共和国的代表参加四国会议问题以及就组织一个确定举行全德选举的条件的调查团的一切详细办法，进行必要的谈判。人民议会决议强调说：为了不再浪费时间，为了便利德国的重新统一，应该加速组织这个调查团。
