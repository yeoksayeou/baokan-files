Xinhua News Agency reporter Zeng Siming's notes from a statement by Cao Jingfu, a surveyor from a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    My name is Cao Jingfu, and I am a surveyor in a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. On April 23rd, Comrade Fang Yuan, another surveyor, and I discovered a large number of fleas scattered by American aircraft near Songdong Village Zizishan in Huaiyang County.

    That day, around four o'clock in the morning, I had just woken up when I heard the sound of an American plane flying from the south. The enemy plane approached, and when it reached the airspace above Zizishan where we were staying, it began to circle. It flew very low, almost as if it would collapse our air-raid shelter. The howling sound of the plane woke the other comrades from their sleep. The plane circled for about ten minutes before flying away.

    After breakfast, Comrade Fang Yuan and I went to a mountain gully near Zizishan to carry the wood we had cut the day before to build the air-raid shelter. This mountain gully sloped from northeast to southwest, was about one hundred and several tens of meters long, and about twenty-odd meters wide. There were some pine trees on the hillside, and below the hillside was farmland with yellow sandy soil, without grass or crops.

    Around ten o'clock, we had carried the wood twice. As we sat on the western slope where we had cut the wood yesterday to rest, after chatting for only a few minutes, I inadvertently noticed two small black bugs crawling on my right shoe. I was about to catch them, but they jumped to another spot. Upon closer inspection, I realized they were fleas. Just as I was about to call Fang Yuan to look, Fang Yuan immediately said to me, "Why are there fleas on your trouser leg?" I looked, and indeed there were four or five black specks jumping around on my trouser leg. At that moment, we felt very strange: Clearly, yesterday when we were resting here after cutting wood, there were none, and this place is about one hundred meters away from the pedestrian path and three *li* away from the villagers' houses, so how could there be fleas? At that moment, I remembered what our superiors often told us: "Raise vigilance and strictly guard against the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. If you find any suspicious insects, report them to your superiors immediately." So, we quickly left the spot where we were sitting, went to a nearby stone slab, shook our clothes clean, and quickly ran to the clinic not far from us to report.

    At ten-thirty, Comrade Fang Yuan and I, led by military doctor Zhang Mingju, returned to the place where I had previously discovered the fleas to investigate. Dr. Zhang brought a small bottle for collecting specimens. After arriving at the scene, we put on masks and re-tightened our trouser legs and cuffs before starting the reconnaissance. During the reconnaissance, I was in front, Dr. Zhang was in the middle, and Fang Yuan was in the back. We first walked from where I found the fleas down the hillside. After only a few steps, I discovered that there were several more fleas on my trouser leg. At that moment, I immediately told Dr. Zhang, "Let's catch some specimens!" After Dr. Zhang saw the fleas, he said, "Let's walk forward and see if there is a place with more fleas." As we walked forward, we found some more fleas on each person's trouser leg, but not many. After walking more than twenty meters, when we reached the farmland, I suddenly saw a patch of relatively dark color on the yellow sandy soil. As soon as my right foot stepped into it, many fleas jumped onto my trouser leg and shoe surface, and the fleas on the ground were also moving around. I was stunned for a moment and exclaimed, "Oh my! Why are there so many here!" Then, I hurriedly took two steps backward. When Dr. Zhang and Fang Yuan arrived, everyone caught thirty or forty fleas from my trouser leg. At that moment, countless black specks were jumping around on the ground, which looked a bit nauseating. We estimated that this dense area was about three or four square meters. After leaving the dense area, we divided into inner, middle, and outer distances and advanced side by side, stopping every few steps to carefully observe or stomp our feet to see if there were any fleas. After going around in a circle, we estimated the entire flea-infested area to be about thirty meters long and ten meters wide based on whether each person had found fleas.

    After the investigation was completed, we cleaned up our clothes and quickly went back to prepare the things to kill the fleas. As Dr. Zhang walked, he looked at the fleas in the glass bottle and said, "So many fleas appearing in the desolate wilderness, there is no doubt that they were dropped by American planes this morning." At that moment, I understood that the American planes in the morning had come to spread germs.

    Before long, the three of us and two other comrades brought three iron buckets of gasoline and three washbasins back to the place where the fleas were discovered. We first poured a circle of gasoline around the flea-infested area to prevent the fleas from jumping elsewhere, and then we got some pine branches, sprinkled them with gasoline, and threw them into the flea area to set them on fire. At that moment, the communicator who was participating in the flea extermination with us saw the raging flames soaring into the sky and said indignantly, "Truman, you have no shame. If you can't beat us, you use bacteriological warfare. The Volunteer Army is truly heroic, defeating the enemy's sea, land, and air forces, and cremating Truman's bacteriological warfare." After the fleas were burned, we first washed our hands with alcohol, went back to take a bath and change into hot clothes, and took sulfa pills for three days. At the same time, we were also quarantined for nine days.

    Finally, I solemnly declare with the noble honor of a soldier: I take full responsibility for the truthfulness of the above events. As one of the witnesses to the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors, I accuse the heinous crimes of American imperialism to peace-loving people all over the world; I call on all kind people to take active action to stop the brutal crimes of the American aggressors.

### 我们发现了美国飞机大批撒布的跳蚤

    我们发现了美国飞机大批撒布的跳蚤
    志愿军某部测绘员  曹景馥  口述
    新华社记者  曾思明笔记
    我的姓名叫曹景馥，是志愿军某部的测绘员。四月二十三日，我和测绘员方元同志，在淮阳郡兰谷面松洞庄子山附近发现了大批美国飞机撒布的跳蚤。
    这天，早上四点钟左右，我刚睡醒就听见从南飞来的美国飞机的声音。敌机由远而近，到了我们住地庄子山上空后即行盘旋。它飞得很低，好像要震塌我们的防空洞似的。呼啸的飞机声音，把其他的几位同志都从熟睡中惊醒过来。飞机盘旋了约十分钟后就飞走了。
    早饭后，我和方元同志到庄子山附近的一条山沟去抬前一天砍好的搭防空洞用的木头。这条山沟从东北向西南倾斜，长约一百数十公尺，宽约二十多公尺。山坡上有些松树，山坡下是黄沙质的田地，没有草，也没有农作物。
    十点钟左右，我们抬完了两次木头。当我们坐在昨天砍木头的西山坡上休息时，只闲谈了几分钟，无意中我发现在我的右鞋上有两个小黑虫在爬，刚想抓它，就给跳到另一个地方去，仔细一看，原来是跳蚤。我正叫方元看的时候，方元马上就对我说：“怎么你的裤腿上有跳蚤呢？”我一看果然有四五个黑色的小点在我裤腿上跳来跳去。当时我们就觉得很奇怪：明明昨天我们砍木头后在这里休息时还没有，而且这里离人行道又有一百公尺左右，离老乡的房子也有三里地，怎么会出现跳蚤呢？这时，我想起了上级时常告诉我们的话：“提高警惕，严防美帝国主义的细菌战，发现有可疑的昆虫，应马上报告上级。”于是，我们很快就离开坐地，到附近的一块石板上去，把衣服脱下来抖干净，就飞快地跑到离我们不远的门诊所去报告。
    十点半钟，我和方元带领着军医张明矩同志回到以前我发现跳蚤的地方来调查。张医生带了一个装标本的小瓶子。到了现场后，我们带上口罩，并且重新扎紧裤脚和袖口，然后开始侦察。侦察时我在前面，张医生在中间，方元在后面。我们先从我发现跳蚤的地方往山坡下走。刚走几步，我就发现在我的裤腿上又有好几只跳蚤，当时我即告诉张医生说：“咱们抓标本吧！”张医生看见了跳蚤后便说：“往前走看看，是否有较多的地方。”我们再往前走时，各人的裤腿上又发现了一些跳蚤，但不多，一直走了二十多公尺，到达田地时，我忽然看见在黄沙质的田地上有一块颜色比较黑的地方，我的右脚刚踏进去，裤腿和鞋面就跳上了很多跳蚤，地面上的跳蚤也在乱动。我怔了一下，叫声“哎呀！这里怎么这样多！”后，便急忙向后倒退两步，等张医生和方元赶到时，大家就在我的裤腿上抓了三四十只。这时，只见地面上无数的黑色小点在跳来跳去，看起来真有点呕心。我们估计了一下，这块密集的地方约有三、四平方米。离开密集区后，我们又分好内、中、外的距离，并排前进，每走几步就停下来仔细观察或跺脚，看看是否有跳蚤。绕了一圈后，我们便按照各人是否发现跳蚤的情况估计一下，整个跳蚤散布地区约三十公尺长，十公尺宽。
    调查完毕后，我们把衣服整理干净后，很快就回去准备扑灭跳蚤的东西。张医生一边走一边看着玻璃瓶内的跳蚤说：“这样多的跳蚤出现在荒山旷野里，毫无疑问是早上美国飞机投撒下来的。”这时，我明白了，原来早上的美国飞机是来撒布细菌的。
    过不多久，我们三个人和另外两位同志，便带了三洋铁桶汽油和三个洗脸盆回到发现跳蚤的地方来。我们先将跳蚤散布区的周围用汽油浇了一圈，使跳蚤不能再向别处乱跳，然后又弄些松枝洒上汽油扔在跳蚤区里，点火焚烧。这时，和我们一起参加灭蚤的通讯员，看见熊熊的火焰腾空而起后就愤慨地说：“杜鲁门，不要脸，打不过我们就用细菌战。志愿军，真英勇，打败敌人的海陆空，火葬杜鲁门的细菌战”。跳蚤烧完后，我们先用酒精洗手，回去后又洗澡和换烫衣服，并服磺胺药片三天。同时我们还被隔离了九天。
    最后，我以军人的崇高荣誉宣称：我对我上述事情的真实性负完全的责任。作为美国侵略者使用细菌武器的见证人之一，我向全世界爱好和平的人们控诉美帝国主义的滔天罪行；我呼吁一切善良的人民积极行动起来，制止美国侵略者的残暴罪行。
