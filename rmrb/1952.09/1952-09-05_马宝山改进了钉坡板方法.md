    Ma Baoshan Improves the Method of Nailing Slope Boards
    Comrade Editor: Ma Baoshan, a young worker in the Fourth Engineering Team of the Taiyuan Construction Engineering Company, improved the method of nailing slope boards in the production increase and economy campaign, increasing work efficiency by more than four times.
    Originally, they always carried wooden boards from the ground to the roof. After carrying them up, the carpenters had to select the appropriate wooden boards before nailing, which wasted a lot of time. At the same time, the method of nailing was also very slow, picking up one nail to nail at a time. In this way, a carpenter could nail a maximum of seventeen squares of slope boards per day. Ma Baoshan came up with a method to arrange the wooden boards in order and then carry them to the roof, which reduced the time spent selecting wooden boards above, enabling the nailing work to be done continuously. In terms of nailing, they also came up with the idea of putting the tips of the nails together beforehand, holding a handful of nails in their hand, so they could nail continuously. Now, a carpenter can nail more than seventy squares of slope boards per day, and the quality also meets the standards. Furthermore, because they nail the tile strips on the road in advance, it further ensures the safety of delivering the boards. Wang Shijun

    马宝山改进了钉坡板方法
    编辑同志：太原建筑工程公司第四工程队青年工人马宝山，在增产节约运动中，改进了钉坡板的方法，工作效率提高四倍多。
    原来他们搬运木板总是从地上往房顶上背，背上去以后，木工还要挑选出适当的木板，才能钉钉子，所以浪费很长时间。同时钉钉子的方法也很慢，钉一个钉拿一个钉，这样，一个木工每天最高能钉坡板十七方。马宝山想出办法，把木板按次序按排好，然后再往房顶上背，就减去了到上面挑选木板的时间，使钉坡板工作能连接不停地做。在钉钉子方面，他们也想法事先就把钉子的尖顺在一头，手里拿着一把钉，就可以按次不停的钉下去。现在一个木工每天能钉坡板七十多方。质量也合乎标准。又由于他们预先把道路钉好瓦条，更保证了送板的安全。  王士俊
