    Actively Promote Award-Winning New Year Pictures
    Editor: After reading the "Circular of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government on Awarding Prizes for New Year Picture Creations in 1951 and 1952" and "Achievements of New Year Picture Work in the Past Two Years as Seen from the New Year Picture Awards" in the September 5th People's Daily, I hope that our publishing agencies will publish these award-winning works in large quantities so that they can meet the broad masses. I live on 14th Street, Tiedong South, Anshan City. At the beginning of this year, I saw the New Year picture "Chairman Mao Talking with Peasants" at a friend's house. Because I liked it very much, I went to the bookstore to buy it, but I couldn't find it. As for "Zhao Guilan at the Heroes' Meeting," I have only seen it once in a pictorial and have not seen a separately printed New Year picture. I suggest that the distribution of New Year pictures be widely promoted to various places through small booksellers or peddlers, and that these arts loved by the masses be truly delivered to the hands of the masses.

    大量推销获奖的年画作品
    编辑同志：读了九月五日人民日报“中央人民政府文化部关于一九五一、五二年度年画创作的评奖”和“从年画评奖看两年来年画工作的成就”的文章后，我希望我们的出版机关，把这些获奖的作品大量出版，使它与广大的群众见面。我住在鞍山市铁东南十四道街，今年年初在朋友家中看见了“毛主席和农民谈话”这幅年画，因非常喜爱，就向书店去买，但是没有买到。至于“群英会上的赵桂兰”，除了在画报上见了一面之外，还没看见过单印的年画。建议年画的发行工作，通过小书贩或货郎担等向各地广泛推销，把这些为群众所喜爱的艺术，真正送到群众手中。　　　　钟定谋
