    A New Construction Project of a Certain Lead-Zinc Mine Does Not Meet Actual Needs
    Ren Min
    The new ore dressing and smelting project of a certain lead-zinc mine in Central South China has been completed. However, this project was designed based on one-sided survey materials, so the quantity and quality of its products are far from the planned requirements at the time of plant construction, resulting in a large waste of national funds.
    The underground engineering of the mine was flooded before liberation, and most of the ground production equipment was also damaged. The First National Non-ferrous Metals Industry Conference decided to drain the mine and resume work. However, the mine's superior leadership organ did not focus on drainage and resumption of work. Based only on some incomplete analysis and experiments, it was believed that there was a lot of waste mine sand with "very high" lead and zinc content. Therefore, it was decided to build a part of ore dressing and smelting equipment and carry out construction. After the new project was completed, in the actual production process, it was discovered that the original analysis of the waste ore sand composition was incorrect. The lead content was only half of the original analysis, and the quality of lead and zinc differed even more from the originally analyzed materials. It was originally thought that there were no impurities in the lead, but now it is found to contain zinc; it was originally thought that there were only "traces" of cadmium in the zinc, but now it is found to contain cadmium. The ore dressing and smelting equipment were all designed based on lead and zinc without impurities, so they are not entirely suitable for actual needs; the smelted zinc and lead do not meet the standards either.
    The main reason for the errors in the mine's capital construction work is that when analyzing the ore sand, the analysis and selection were not carried out extensively. The analysis was only carried out in local ore sand, and the local data was used as the basis for the design. From this, we can gain an experience that investigation and survey work must be comprehensive and meticulous, and there must be no sloppiness.

    某铅锌矿新建工程不合实际需要
    任民
    中南某铅锌矿新建选矿和冶炼工程已经完成了。但这个工程是根据片面的调查材料来设计的，所以它的产品的数量和质量都和建厂时计划要求相差很远，以致大量浪费了国家资金。
    该矿井下工程在解放前曾被淹没，大部分地面生产设备也被破坏。第一次全国有色金属工业会议决定要该矿排水复工。但该矿上级领导机关却没有以排水复工为主，只根据一些不完全的分析和试验，认为该处废矿砂很多，含铅、锌的成分“甚高”，因此决定新建一部分选矿和冶炼设备，并进行施工。新的工程完成后，在实际的生产过程中，才发现原来对废矿砂成分的分析是不正确的。其中铅的含量只有原分析的一半，铅、锌的质量和原来分析的材料相差更远。原来认为铅内没有杂质，现在却发现含有锌；原来认为锌内只有镉的“痕迹”，现在却发现有镉。选矿和冶炼的设备都是根据没有杂质的铅和锌来设计的，所以，不完全适合于实际需要了；冶炼出来的锌和铅也都不合标准。
    该矿的基本建设工作发生错误的主要原因，是在分析矿砂的时候，没有广泛地进行分析和试选，仅仅在局部的矿砂中进行分析，把局部的资料当作全部的资料来作设计的根据。从这里我们便可取得一个经验，调查和勘测工作，必须是全面的周密的，一点也不能马虎。
