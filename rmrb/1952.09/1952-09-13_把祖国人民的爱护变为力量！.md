    Turning the Motherland's Love into Strength!
    To the Editor: I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, currently recuperating at the Shijiazhuang Peace Hospital due to illness. We are living very well in the hospital, and the doctors and nurses are treating us with great enthusiasm and care. We are very grateful to the people of the motherland for their love and care. During the "August 1st" Army Day, the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea sent us comfort money on behalf of the people of the motherland; people from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang continuously came to慰问us and sent many慰问gifts. I thought about it for two days in bed and felt that fighting and working are the responsibilities of us revolutionary soldiers. The people of the motherland truly cherish us, using the fruits of their hard work to comfort us. We cannot bear to accept so much.

    I made up my mind in the hospital bed to turn the motherland's love for us into strength. I used the comfort money to buy study supplies and resolved to study diligently to improve my cultural level. Mastering culture and modern weapons strengthens the national defense of the motherland. I am learning to write characters and studying politics every day in the hospital bed. I am determined to fight to the end to defend world peace and our happy life.

    In the old society, I was an oppressed farmer, a rough fellow. In the people's army, under the cultivation of the Party, I learned culture. This is the first letter I have written with my own hand, and it is also what I want to say to the people of the motherland. Zheng Rongxiang

    把祖国人民的爱护变为力量！
    编辑同志：我是中国人民解放军的一个战士，现在因病在石家庄和平医院休养。在医院里，我们生活得很好，医生、护士们都是热情周到地为我们治疗。我们十分感谢祖国人民对我们的爱护。“八一”建军节时，抗美援朝总会代表祖国人民发给我们慰劳金；石家庄市各界人民不断来慰问我们，并送来很多慰劳品。我在床上想了两天，觉得战斗和工作都是我们革命军人的职责。祖国人民对我们真是爱护倍至，用他们辛勤劳动的成果来慰劳我们。我们太担当不起了。
    我在病床上下了决心，要把祖国人民对我们的爱护变为力量。我把慰劳金买了学习用具，决心努力学文化。学好文化、掌握了现代化武器就加强了祖国国防力量。我就在病床上每天学写字，学政治，我决心为保卫世界和平和我们美满幸福的生活而奋斗到底。
    我在旧社会里是一个受压迫的农民，是一个大老粗。在人民的军队里，在党的培养下，学会了文化。这是我亲笔写的第一封信，也是我要对祖国人民说的话。    郑融祥
