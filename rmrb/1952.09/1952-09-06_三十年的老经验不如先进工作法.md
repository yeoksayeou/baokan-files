Thirty Years of Old Experience Is No Match for Advanced Working Methods
Xu Zhengkai One Star

Zhang Litang, an experienced bricklayer with thirty years of experience in the Baoding City Construction Company, was unconvinced when the Su Changyou advanced bricklaying method was promoted. Zhang Litang said, "I have thirty years of bricklaying experience. What does Su Changyou have?"

On July 18th, the company began to learn the Su Changyou team's advanced bricklaying method. Zhang Litang had already braced himself to compete on the spot with the team implementing the Su Changyou advanced working method using the old method of large shovel with mortar. After half a day, Zhang Litang's team indeed surpassed the results of the team that was initially learning the Su Changyou advanced experience, laying three more layers of bricks, exceeding the quota by 1,035 bricks. This time, the new method was defeated by the old method, and some workers had even less confidence in the new method. Zhang Litang's team was even less willing to accept the new working method, and their conservative thinking became even more entrenched. In response to this situation, the leading cadres immediately convened a meeting of the teams learning the Su Changyou advanced bricklaying method to discuss and study the reasons why they were lagging behind Zhang Litang's team. They believed that the main reason was that they were not yet proficient in the initial practice, but there were still achievements. At the same time, they criticized individual disheartened workers and planned the next competition.

The next day, the two teams' bricklaying competition began again, both secretly exerting their strength. As a result, in half a day of competition (four hours and thirty minutes), the team learning the Su Changyou advanced bricklaying method, in addition to catching up with the three layers from the previous day, also surpassed Zhang Litang's team by four layers of bricks.

Through this on-site competition, empiricism and conservative thinking were defeated. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the leading cadres further persuaded and explained to Zhang Litang to enlighten his thinking. After these efforts, Zhang Litang accepted the Su Changyou advanced bricklaying method. Now, he not only automatically and enthusiastically learns the Su Changyou team's advanced bricklaying method, but also wants to implement the double-handed mortar squeezing method. Now, Zhang Litang's team can lay 15,880 bricks a day (ten hours), which is equivalent to three major workers for four people, with each person laying 5,000 bricks per day. In the recent competition to promote the Su Changyou advanced bricklaying method, nine units of bricklayers from the Baoding Construction Company participated in the Red Flag competition, and Zhang Litang's team received an award flag.

    三十年的老经验不如先进工作法
    徐征凯  一星
    保定市建筑公司瓦工老技术工人张立堂，有三十年的砌墙经验。在推广苏长有先进砌砖法时，张立堂很不服气地说：“我有三十年的砌墙经验，苏长有有啥？”
    七月十八日，公司开始学习苏长有小组先进砌砖法了，张立堂早就蹩足了劲，要用大铲带砂灰的老法和实行苏长有先进工作法的组当场比赛。经过半天的时间，张立堂组果然超过了初次学习苏长有先进经验的小组的成绩，多砌了三层砖，超额砖数达一千零三十五块。这次，新法被老法战胜了，有的工人对新法的信心更不足了。张立堂组对接受新工作法更不虚心，保守思想更加稳固。领导干部针对着这一情况，立即召集学习苏长有先进砌砖法的小组开会讨论，研究他们落后于张立堂组的原因，认为主要是初次演习还不熟练，但是还是有成绩的，同时，批判了个别泄气的工人，并计划了下一次的比赛工作。
    第二天两组砌砖比赛又开始了，都暗地使着劲，结果，半天的比赛（四小时三十分），学习苏长有先进砌砖法的小组，除赶齐前天三层外，又超过了张立堂组四层砖。
    经过这次现场比赛，经验主义、守旧思想都失败了。领导干部趁着这个机会，又向张立堂进行说服解释，启发他的思想转变。经过这些工作之后，张立堂接受了苏长有先进砌砖法。现在，他不但自动地热情地学习苏长有小组先进砌砖法，而且更要实行双手挤浆法。现在，张立堂小组一天（十小时）能砌砖一万五千八百八十块，四人合三个大工计算，每人每天砌砖五千块。在最近推广苏长有先进砌砖法竞赛运动中，保定建筑公司瓦工参加红旗竞赛者有九个单位，张立堂组得到了一面奖旗。
