Editor's Note: Since the publication of the draft amendments to the Rules of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on August 20th, Pravda has continuously published commentaries explaining the various basic clauses of the new Party Charter. We are now translating these successively as a reference for our study of the draft amendments to the Rules of the CPSU (B).

Our country is experiencing exciting days. The statement of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) on convening the 19th Congress of the CPSU (B) has aroused great enthusiasm among all the people of our country. The political and labor activism of the masses is growing. The Soviet people unanimously express their determination to commemorate the Party Congress with new achievements in the construction of communism.

The documents of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) regarding the 19th Congress—the draft directives of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union for 1951-1955, and the draft amendments to the Party Charter—have received enthusiastic praise from the masses. These historic documents open up great prospects for the further prosperity of our socialist motherland—the fortress of freedom and happiness for all nationalities.

The cause of Lenin and Stalin's Party has become the cause of the entire people in our country. The broad masses of working people regard the Communist Party as their own party, a close and beloved party, whose expansion and strengthening are intimately related to them, and at the same time they voluntarily entrust their fate to the leadership of the Party.

Nearly half a century has passed since the great leaders and teachers of the proletariat, Lenin and Stalin, laid the foundation of the Bolshevik Party. Our Party has traversed a great and glorious path, incomparable to that of any other political party in the world. The Communist Party organized the alliance of workers and peasants, went through the October Revolution of 1917, overthrew the regime of capitalists and landlords, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, eliminated capitalism, eliminated the exploitation of man by man, and ensured the establishment of a socialist society.

In the current situation, our Party is realizing new and even greater tasks. The draft amendments to the Party Charter state:

"Now, the main task of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is: to build a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to gradually improve the material and cultural level of society, to educate members of society in the spirit of internationalism and fraternal ties with the working people of all countries, and to extremely strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland against the aggressive actions of its enemies."

Our Party has established the inviolability of the Bolshevik organizational principles, and has always strived to make its organizational forms and working methods fully and adequately adapted to the characteristics of a particular historical situation and the political tasks arising from that situation. The great significance of the draft amendments to the Party Charter lies in the fact that it summarizes the richest organizational experience of our Party, develops the basic organizational principles of the Party, and appropriately concretizes these principles in accordance with the new tasks of communist construction.

The draft amendments to the Party Charter state:

"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a voluntary fighting alliance composed of like-minded communists from the working class, working peasants, and working intellectuals." Any worker, any Soviet citizen who does not exploit the labor of others, who recognizes the Party Program and Party Charter and actively promotes their realization, who works in one of the Party's organizations and implements all Party resolutions, may become a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Conscious, active workers, peasants, and intellectuals who are loyal to the cause of communism, may be accepted as Party members.

The main condition for the strength and power of the Party is the unity of its ranks. The draft amendments to the Party Charter clearly stipulate the obligations of Party members. Party members must do their best to safeguard the unity of the Party and be active fighters for the implementation of Party resolutions. For them, merely agreeing with Party resolutions is not enough. A communist's passive or outwardly compliant attitude towards Party resolutions will weaken the Party's fighting power, and is therefore incompatible with the status of a Party member. Party members should abide by Party and state discipline, without exception. All Party members must master the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism and play a model role in their work.

Lenin and Stalin taught that the Party is the advanced, conscious, and organized detachment of the working class, and the highest organizational form among all other organizations of the working class. The Party is the embodiment of the connection between the advanced ranks of the working class and the millions of workers. Therefore, the draft amendments to the Party Charter require Party members to: "Constantly strengthen ties with the masses, promptly reflect the demands and needs of the working people, explain the Party's policies and resolutions to the non-Party masses, and always remember that the strength and invincibility of our Party lie in its inseparable blood ties with the people."

The Party educates cadres and all Party members in the spirit of Bolshevik self-criticism and criticism, with high standards and an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings. The draft amendments to the Party Charter state that Party members should "develop self-criticism and criticism from below, expose shortcomings in their work and strive to eliminate them, oppose superficial achievements, and oppose becoming dizzy with success in their work. Suppression of criticism is a serious evil. Anyone who stifles criticism, is arrogant, and likes flattery cannot remain in the ranks of the Party."

Party members have no right to conceal unfavorable situations, and have no right to ignore improper conduct that harms the interests of the Party and the state. The obligation of Party members is to be loyal and honest to the Party, and not to conceal or distort the truth. The obligation of Party members is to keep Party and state secrets, maintain political vigilance, and remember that communists must be vigilant at all times and under all circumstances.

In order to implement the Party's correct political line, cadres and people are needed who understand the Party's political line, regard it as their own line and are determined to implement it, are good at implementing it in practice and are able to be responsible for it, defend it and fight for it. Communists, in any position entrusted to them by the Party, must resolutely implement the Party's instructions on the correct selection of cadres according to their political qualities and professional abilities. Any behavior that violates these instructions, selecting staff based on friendship, personal connections, hometown ties, and family relationships, is incompatible with the status of a Party member.

The draft amendments to the Party Charter make the obligations borne by communists noble and responsible. The rights enjoyed by each communist are also great and unshakable. Communists have the right to participate in free and earnest discussions on issues of Party policy at Party meetings or in Party publications, to criticize any Party worker at Party meetings, to elect and be elected to Party organs, to request to participate personally when resolutions are adopted regarding their activities or behavior, and to raise any questions and make statements to any level of Party organ, up to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Democratic centralism is the guiding principle of our Party's organizational structure. Lenin and Stalin taught that in order to work correctly and lead the masses in a planned manner, the Party should be organized on the principle of centralism. In order to consolidate the principle of democratic centralism, the draft amendments to the Party Charter stipulate that all leading organs of the Party, from the highest to the lowest, are elected, that Party organs make periodic work reports to their own Party organizations, and that Party discipline and the principle of the minority submitting to the majority, and the absolute obedience of lower organs to the decisions of higher organs are strictly observed.

The clauses of the draft amendments to the Party Charter regarding inner-Party democracy are of great significance. The draft stipulates that free and earnest discussion of Party policy issues within individual organizations or within the entire Party is an inalienable right that every Party member should have under the inner-Party democratic system. At the same time, the draft stipulates conditions that can safeguard the Party and prevent anti-Party elements from abusing inner-Party democracy, and conditions that make inner-Party democracy conducive to the cause and prevent it from being used to harm the Party and the working class.

The draft amendments to the Party Charter are documents of great significance. They explain the historic victories achieved by our Party, talk about the new tasks facing the Party and the organizational methods for realizing these tasks. Therefore, it is natural that the draft Party Charter has received a warm response among the broad masses of the Party and among all working people. District and city Party conferences are now being held. The draft amendments to the Party Charter are being enthusiastically discussed and praised.

All parts of the Soviet Union are preparing to welcome the 19th Congress of the CPSU (B). The broad masses of Party members and all working people are answering the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) on convening the 19th Party Congress and the historical documents submitted by the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) to the Congress by rallying more and more closely around the Communist Party, around the Central Committee of the Party, and around the great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin.

    联共党章的修正草案
    ——八月二十三日苏联真理报社论
    编者按：自八月二十日苏联共产党（布）党章修正草案公布后，苏联真理报连续发表了解释新党章各个基本条文的评论，现特陆续译出，作为我们学习联共（布）党章修正草案的参考。
    我国正经历着令人激动的日子。联共（布）中央委员会关于召开联共（布）第十九次代表大会的声明，在我国全体人民之间唤起了巨大的热忱。群众的政治积极性和劳动积极性增长着。苏联人民一致表示决心要以在共产主义建设中的新成就来纪念党的代表大会。
    联共（布）中央关于第十九次代表大会的文件——第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划的指示草案和党章修正草案——在群众中受到了热烈的赞扬。这些历史性的文件开辟了争取我们社会主义祖国——各族人民自由和幸福的堡垒——进一步繁荣的伟大斗争远景。
    列宁、斯大林党的事业，在我国已成为全体人民的事业。广大劳动群众把共产党看做是自己的党、亲近的和亲爱的党，这个党的扩大和加强，都和他们有着切身关系，同时他们自愿地把自己的命运信托给党的领导。
    从无产阶级的伟大领袖和导师列宁和斯大林奠定了布尔什维克党的基础时起，已经过去将近半世纪了。我们的党经过了一条伟大而光荣的道路，世界上任何一个政党所经过的道路都不能和它相比。共产党组织了工农联盟，经过了一九一七年的十月革命，推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了无产阶级专政，肃清了资本主义，消灭了人对人的剥削并保证了社会主义社会的建立。
    在目前的情况下，我们的党实现着新的更加巨大的任务。党章修正草案中说道：
    “现在，苏联共产党的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，逐步提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，极度加强苏维埃祖国对其敌人侵略行动的积极防御。”
    我们的党确立了布尔什维主义组织原则的不可动摇性，并始终力图使它的组织形式和工作方法完全而充分地适应某一历史情况的特点和由这一情况所产生的政治任务。党章修正草案的巨大意义，在于它总结了我党最丰富的组织经验，发展了党的基本组织原则，并把这些原则适当地按照共产主义建设的新任务而加以具体化。
    在党章修正草案中指示说：
    “苏联共产党是工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中思想一致的共产主义者所组成的自愿的战斗联盟。”任何一个劳动者，一个不剥削他人劳动的苏联公民，承认党纲党章并积极促其实现，在党的一个组织中工作并执行党的一切决议，都可能成为苏联共产党的党员。具有觉悟的、积极的、忠实于共产主义事业的工人、农民和知识分子，得被接收为党员。
    党的所以有力量和强大的主要条件，就是它的队伍的统一。在党章的修正草案中明确地规定了党员的义务。党员要尽力护卫党的统一，是为实现党的决议的积极战士。对于他来说，仅仅同意党的决议是不够的。共产党员对党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度，会削弱党的战斗力，因此和党员的身份是不相容的。党员应该遵守党和国家的纪律，一切党员均无例外，要掌握马克思列宁主义基础，在劳动中起模范作用。
    列宁和斯大林教导说，党是工人阶级先进的、有觉悟的、有组织的部队，是工人阶级其他各组织之间的最高组织形式。党是工人阶级的先进队伍和千百万工人群众的联系的体现。因此党章修正草案要求党员：“经常巩固与群众的联系，及时反映劳动人民的要求和需要，向非党群众解释党的政策和决议，时时记住我党之所以有力量和不可战胜就在于它和人民有着不可分割的血肉联系。”
    党以布尔什维克的自我批评与批评的精神，以高度严格要求和对缺点的不妥协精神教育干部，教育全体共产党员。党章修正草案中说，党员应当“展开自我批评和自下面的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力加以消灭，反对表面成绩，反对因为工作中的成绩而冲昏头脑。压制批评是严重的恶行。凡是窒息批评、自高自大、喜欢奉承的人，都不能留在党的队伍里。”
    党员没有权利隐瞒事情的不顺利的情况，没有权利不过问损害党和国家利益的不正当行为。党员的义务是要对党忠诚老实，不允许隐瞒和歪曲真相。党员的义务，是要保守党和国家的机密，保持政治警惕性，记得共产党员在任何时候，在任何情况下都必须保持警惕。
    为了实现党的正确的政治路线，需要干部、需要人，这些人要明了党的政治路线，把它看作自己的路线并决心实现它，善于在实际中实现它并能够对它负责，保卫它而且为它战斗。共产党员在党所托付的任何岗位上，要坚决执行党关于按照政治品质和业务能力正确选拔干部的指示。凡是破坏这种指示，按照朋友关系，私人情面、同乡和亲戚关系选拔工作人员的行为，都与党员的身份不相容的。
    党章修正草案使共产党员所担负的义务是高贵的和责任重大的。每个共产党员所享有的权利也是伟大的和不可动摇的。共产党员有权在党的会议上或党的报刊上参加党的政策问题的自由的、认真的讨论，在党的会议上批评党的任何工作人员，选举和被选举到党的机关，凡在通过关于自己的活动或行为的决议时；要求亲自参加，向党的任何一级机关直到苏联共产党中央委员会提出任何问题和声明。
    民主集中制是我党组织结构的指导原则。列宁和斯大林教导说，为了正确地进行工作和有计划地领导群众，党应当是组织在集中制的原则上。为了巩固民主集中制的原则，党章修正草案规定党的一切领导机关，由最高的到最低的，都是选举出来的，党的机关向自己党的组织作定期的工作报告，严格遵守党的纪律和少数服从多数，下级机关绝对服从上级机关的决议。
    党章修正草案关于党内民主的条款具有重大的意义。在草案中规定，在个别组织内或在全党内自由而认真地讨论党的政策问题，是每个党员根据党内民主制所应有的不可剥夺的权利。同时草案规定了能够护卫党而不让反党分子滥用党内民主的条件和使党内民主有利于事业而不会被利用来损害党和工人阶级的条件。
    党章修正草案是具有重大意义的文件。它说明我党所获得的历史性的胜利，谈到党面前的新任务和实现这些任务的组织方法。因之党章草案在广大的党的群众中，在一切劳动人民之间获得热烈的反应，是很自然的。现在正在举行的区的和城市的党的代表会议。正在热烈地讨论和赞扬党章的修正草案。
    苏联全国各地正在准备迎接联共（布）第十九次代表大会。广大的党内群众，一切劳动人民以愈来愈紧密地团结在共产党周围，团结在党的中央委员会和伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围，来回答联共（布）中央委员会关于召开第十九次党的代表大会的决定和联共（布）中央委员会对代表大会所提出的历史性的文件。
