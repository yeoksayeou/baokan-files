Seeing Peace from Beijing
Fu Zuoyi

    The Peace Conference representing 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific region is about to convene. The convening of this conference and its selection to be held in Beijing are both of very rich significance.

    In Beijing, it is easiest for people to recall how the Japanese warlords fifteen years ago unreasonably launched a full-scale war of aggression against the peace-loving people of China. This war lasted for more than eight years, causing the deaths of tens of millions of innocent people, and dragging most of the people in the entire Asia and Pacific region into a life of painful darkness. Now people's memories of this war are still fresh, but the new aggressor, the United States, is copying the old tricks of the Japanese warlords, supporting the resurgence of the Japanese warlords, provoking and creating new wars of aggression, and once again threatening this peaceful land.

    In Beijing, you can clearly see that in Japan, just across the sea, old war criminals are being released from their cages in batches, while people who demand peace are being thrown into prison in batches. The new aggressors and the old aggressors are colluding with each other, transforming Japan into a new war base. They are changing peaceful industries into munitions industries, and flattening vast farmlands into air force airfields. Disregarding the resistance of the Japanese people, they are first colonizing Japan, and then forcing Japan to serve as mercenaries in new wars of aggression, letting it replay a bloody drama of aggression for its new masters.

    In Beijing, you can clearly see that in Korea, just across the water, this criminal bloody drama of aggression has already begun. The new aggressors, thousands of miles away from their own country, claiming it is "for their own safety," are using large numbers of aircraft, using high-explosive ammunition, and using bacteriological warfare, which is rejected by good people all over the world, to exert "military pressure" on peaceful women and children.

    In their deceptive lies to the world, the new war instigators have consistently and absurdly described our peace-loving New China as a terrible "danger." But in Beijing, you can clearly see, what "danger" do we have to be afraid of? We have the world's longest cultural history, and we have never invaded others. The nature of our economic production is to improve the living standards of our working people, so we are satisfied with our domestic market and have never had territorial demands on foreign countries. Our people are living a highly democratic life. Our various ethnic groups are building close and inseparable relationships on the basis of equality and mutual assistance. Our people love their leaders because they have seen the light. Building their own happy lives on their own land has attracted all the thoughts and energy of the people of the whole country. Taking my own job as an example, water conservancy construction is entirely peaceful construction. I can explain to the whole world that our water conservancy construction accounts for the largest proportion of the national budget allocation. If the amount of our water conservancy construction funds is compared with the most water conservancy funds in one year during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, it is equal to our three years of work compared to their one hundred and twelve years of work. This figure should allow people all over the world who do not have prejudices to clearly understand the true intentions of our people.

    The only reasonable logic for the new war instigators to think that New China is "dangerous" is that in the eyes of war-mongers, peace is the greatest "danger." In this sense, in Beijing, you can indeed see the real growth of the forces of peace. 450 million people who in the past did not fully understand the root of their suffering and were left to be slaughtered are now awakened and want to decide their own destiny. Their eyes are bright, and they can already distinguish who is a friend and who is a robber. Their strength is powerful. In the past ten years, in almost bare-handed conditions, relying only on flesh and blood and an unshakable spiritual will, they once drove away the Japanese aggressors. And now they have better armed themselves, both spiritually and materially. There are invincible and powerful armed forces on their land, including new-style aircraft flying in the sky and tanks and heavy artillery galloping on the ground. A quarter of the world's population, with the great will to defend peace, enters the stage of world affairs, which is indeed dangerous and terrible for robbers, but it is precisely the most welcome news for peace-loving people all over the world. Peace will surely triumph over war. In the blue sky of China, only white doves of peace will be allowed to soar freely. In Beijing, you can get such a clear impression. (Xinhua News Agency)

    从北京看和平
    傅作义
    代表亚洲和太平洋区域十六亿人民的和平会议，就要开会了。这个会议的召开，和它选定在北京开会，都是有非常丰富的意义的。
    在北京，人们最容易回忆起，十五年前的日本军阀，是怎样无理地对中国的和平人民发动了全面的侵略战争。这个战争持续了八年以上的时间，造成成千万无辜人民的死亡，并且把整个亚洲和太平洋区域的多数人民一齐拖进了痛苦的黑暗的生活。现在人们对于这个战争的记忆犹新，可是新的侵略者的美国却又在抄袭日本军阀的故技，扶持日本军阀的再起，挑拨和制造新的侵略战争，再度威胁着这一片和平的土地。
    在北京，您可以清楚地看到，在一海之隔的日本，旧日的战争罪犯，在成批地释放出笼，而要求和平的人民则成批地投进监狱。新的侵略者们和旧的侵略者互相勾结，正在把日本改造为新的战争的基地。他们把和平工业改变为军火工业，把广大的农田平毁为空军机场，他们不顾日本人民的反抗，首先把日本殖民地化，然后强制日本充任新的侵略战争的雇佣兵，让它为了新的主人，再演一幕侵略的血剧。
    在北京，您可以清楚地看到，在一水之隔的朝鲜，这种侵略的罪恶的血剧早已开场，新的侵略者们在远离自己的国土几千公里的地方，说是“为了自己的安全”，在使用大量飞机，在使用高度的爆炸弹药，在使用为全世界善良人民所弃绝的细菌战，对着和平的妇女儿童，施行“军事压力”。
    新的战争挑拨者，在他们欺骗世界的谎言里，
    一贯地是把我们爱好和平的新中国，荒谬地描写成可怕的“危险”，但是在北京您可以清楚地看见，我们有什么“危险”可怕？我们有世界最长的文化历史，从来没有侵略过别人。我们经济生产的性质，是在提高自己劳动人民的生活水平，因此我们满足于自己的国内市场，从来没有对外的领土的要求。我们的人民在过着高度民主的生活。我们的各个民族在平等互助的基础上建立着亲密无间的关系。我们的人民因为看见了光明而热爱自己的领袖。在自己的国土上建立自己的幸福生活，吸引了全国人民全部的心思和精力。即以我所在的工作岗位来说，水利建设完全是和平建设，我可以向全世界说明，我们的水利建设在全国经费分配的比例里占最大的比重，我们水利建设经费的数字，若和国民党反动统治期间水利经费最多一年相比，等于我们三年做了他们一百十二年的工作。这个数字应该可以使全世界不抱成见的人们，清楚地了解我们人民的真正意向。
    新的战争挑拨者所以认为新中国是“危险”的，其唯一的合理的逻辑，就是在战争贩子的眼里，和平就是最大的“危险”。从这一意义上说，在北京，您确实可以看到和平力量的真正的壮大。有四亿五千万人民在过去是不完全明白自己痛苦的根源而听人宰割的，现在他们觉醒了，要自己决定自己的命运。他们的眼光明亮了，已经能够辨别谁是朋友，谁是强盗。他们的力量是强大的，他们在过去的十几年中，在几乎是赤手空拳的情况下，只凭着血肉和不可动摇的精神意志，就曾经赶走过日本侵略者，而现在他们是把自己更好地武装起来了，无论是在精神或物质方面。在他们的国土上已经有了不可战胜的强大的武装部队，包括在天空飞翔的新式飞机和地上奔驰的坦克重炮。占全世界人口四分之一的人民，带着保卫和平的伟大意志走进世界事务的舞台，这对强盗的确是危险而可怕的，但是这对全世界爱好和平的人民，恰好是最值得欢迎的消息。和平一定能够战胜战争，在中国的蔚蓝的天空中，将只容许和平的白鸽自由翱翔，在北京您可以得到这样一个明确的印象。（新华社）
