    Strengthen Unity, Strive for Peace
    Liu Geping
    For the sake of peace, the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are further uniting. The preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing this June was an important step towards unity for the people of the Asian and Pacific regions in the sacred cause of opposing wars of aggression and safeguarding peace. The declaration of the preparatory meeting stated: "Peace cannot be waited for; peace requires the unity of peace-loving people to strive for it." It also stated: "Combined with the peace-loving people in other parts of the world who hold the same aspirations, the people of the Asian and Pacific regions are able to make peace triumph over war." This declaration has become the common belief of the vast people of the Asian and Pacific regions today. The activities launched by the people of various countries to participate in this peace conference have formed a massive movement. More people have joined the ranks of defending peace. The peace forces in the Asian and Pacific regions have become increasingly strong.
    The people of all nationalities in China are resolutely opposed to wars of aggression and support peace.
    The Chinese people deeply know the severity of the harm of imperialist wars of aggression and also deeply know that imperialist wars of aggression can be completely crushed. In the past hundred years, the Chinese people have experienced profound disasters under imperialist aggression. Countless good people were slaughtered, and countless lovely cities and villages were destroyed. The people of all nationalities in China were unwilling to live the life of slaves and bravely rose up to resist imperialist aggression and their running dogs. Especially in the past thirty years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all nationalities in China have carried out arduous revolutionary struggles, and finally realized their aspirations for independence, freedom, democracy, and peace. The imperialists' delusion to enslave the people of all nationalities in China again can never be realized.
    From their own experiences, the people of all nationalities in China deeply realize the loveliness of peace. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than sixty nationalities in China have lived together in equality and friendship, practicing unity and mutual assistance, which has enabled the country's recovery work and construction cause to achieve brilliant achievements. With the help of the Han nationality, all minority nationalities have also developed their own political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings. Minority nationalities, who have long been in a state of no political power in history, have become the masters of state power and implemented national regional autonomy; agricultural and pastoral production in minority areas has generally increased; their diseases have been greatly reduced, and some areas have eliminated historical diseases; national schools have also been established. These achievements were achieved in a short period of three years in a relatively stable environment. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all nationalities in China are not only striving for the construction of new democracy, but also will strive for the construction of socialism in the future. Therefore, the people of all nationalities in China need lasting peace and stability.
    The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as there is no imperialist interference in the internal affairs of other countries, peace can be achieved immediately. The difference in nationalities has not prevented the extensive approach of the Chinese people to the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions; the difference in social systems has not prevented the establishment of economic ties between the Chinese and Japanese people, nor has it prevented cultural exchanges between China and India and Burma. Facts are shattering the malicious instigations of the aggressors, and the peace-loving people all over the world are increasingly strengthening their unity.
    Peace is the key to the happiness of people all over the world, so it must triumph over war. And when peace-loving people all over the world are closely united, it can completely triumph over war. The people of all nationalities in China have full confidence in stopping the imperialist wars of aggression and striving for world peace.
    In the past three months, the American aggressors have become increasingly arrogant and rogue at the Korean armistice talks: they have exhausted all kinds of despicable means to obstruct the progress of the meeting; they have detained and wantonly massacred prisoners of war; they have unilaterally adjourned the meeting and refused to meet; they have clamored to make the Korean people suffer "disease, displacement," and "suffering and irreparable loss"; they have repeated the platitudes of "military pressure" and the clamor of expanding the war, and have wantonly bombed peaceful Korean towns and invaded Chinese airspace for bombing and strafing. The Korean armistice talks have fallen into a stalemate due to the unreasonable obstruction and deliberate sabotage by the United States. At the same time, the American aggressors' aggressive activities in the entire Asian and Pacific regions have also become more active. These facts tell all peace-loving people in the Asian and Pacific regions that they must quickly further and closely unite and carry out resolute and organized struggles for peace.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will soon open in Beijing. Due to the victorious preparatory work of the peace fighters of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, and due to the united efforts of the representatives of various countries, it is expected that this conference will further promote the unity of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, and enable the struggle to defend Asian peace and world peace to achieve victory.

    加强团结，争取和平
    刘格平
    为了和平，亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民正在进一步团结起来。今年六月在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，是亚洲及太平洋区域的人民在反对侵略战争、保卫和平的神圣事业中走向团结的重要步骤。筹备会议的宣言中说：“和平不能坐待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。”又说：“与世界其他地区抱有同样愿望的爱好和平的人民结合在一起，亚洲及太平洋区域的人民是能够使和平战胜战争的。”这个宣言，今天已成为亚洲及太平洋区域广大人民的共同信念。各国人民为参加这次和平会议所展开的活动，已形成一个声势浩大的运动。更多的人民已站到保卫和平的队伍里来。亚洲及太平洋区域的和平力量已愈来愈强大。
    中国各民族人民是坚决反对侵略战争，拥护和平的。
    中国人民深知帝国主义侵略战争为害的严重，同时也深知帝国主义的侵略战争是完全可以粉碎的。近百年间，中国人民在帝国主义的侵略下曾经历了深重的灾难，无数善良的人民被屠杀，无数可爱的城市和农村被毁坏了。中国各族人民不甘于过奴隶的生活，英勇地起来反抗帝国主义的侵略和其走狗们。特别近三十年来，中国各族人民在中国共产党的领导下，进行了艰苦的革命斗争，终于实现了独立、自由、民主、和平的愿望。帝国主义再来奴役中国各族人民的妄想，已永远不可能实现。
    中国各族人民从自己的经历中，深深地体验到和平的可爱。自中华人民共和国成立以来，中国六十多个民族平等友爱地生活在一起，实行团结互助，已使国家的恢复工作和建设事业获得了辉煌的成就。各少数民族在汉族的帮助下，也发展了自己的政治、经济和文化教育事业。在历史上长期处于无政权地位的少数民族，已经做了国家政权的主人，并实行了民族的区域自治；少数民族地区的农、牧业普遍增产；他们的疾病已大为减少，有的地区已经消灭了历史上遗留下来的恶疾；民族的学校也已经建立起来。这些成就，是在短短的三年内，在比较安定的环境中达到的。中国各民族人民在中国共产党的领导下，不仅为新民主主义的建设而奋斗，将来还要为社会主义的建设而奋斗，因此，中国各民族人民需要持久的和平与安定。
    中国人民深信，只要没有帝国主义干涉他国的内政，和平就立刻可以实现。民族的不同，并没有妨碍中国人民与亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的广泛的接近；社会制度的不同，也没有阻止中、日两国人民建立经济的联系，没有阻止中国和印度、缅甸之间的文化交流。事实在粉碎着侵略者的恶意挑拨，全世界爱好和平的人民在日益加强团结。
    和平，是全世界人民幸福之所系，因此它必须战胜战争。而且当全世界爱好和平的人民紧密地团结起来的时候，它是完全可以战胜战争的。中国各民族人民对于制止帝国主义的侵略战争，争取世界和平，怀着充分的信念。
    近三个月来，美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判席上越来越狂妄和无赖了：他使尽了各种各样的卑鄙手段阻挠会议的进行；他扣留并恣意屠杀战俘；他片面休会，拒绝开会；他扬言要使朝鲜人民遭受“疾病，流离失所”，遭受“痛苦与不可弥补的损失”；他重复“军事压力”的滥调和扩大战争的叫嚣，并滥炸朝鲜和平城镇，侵入中国领空进行轰炸扫射。朝鲜的停战谈判由于美国方面的无理阻挠和蓄意破坏而陷入僵局。与此同时，美国侵略者在整个亚洲及太平洋区域的侵略活动也更加积极，这些事实告诉亚洲及太平洋区域一切爱好和平的人民，必须迅速进一步紧密地团结起来，为了和平，进行坚决而有组织的斗争。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议不久即将在北京开幕。由于亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平战士们胜利地进行了会议的筹备工作，由于各国代表们的团结努力，预期这次会议必将进一步促进亚洲及太平洋区域人民的团结，并使保卫亚洲和平及世界和平的斗争取得胜利。
