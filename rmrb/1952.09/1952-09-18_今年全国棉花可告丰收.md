Xinhua News Agency, 16th: This year, a widespread bumper cotton harvest is expected throughout the country. Currently, cotton fields in the North China region have generally begun harvesting, and the total output will exceed the plan. Cotton growth in the Yuncheng area of Shanxi Province is particularly good. The average yield of seed cotton from irrigated land can reach 300 jin per mu, while dry land can yield an average of 250 jin of seed cotton per mu or more. Cotton in Hebei Province is generally better than last year. Preliminary estimates suggest that the dryland cotton near the hometown of labor model Zhang Defang in Feixiang County, about twenty villages, can yield an average of over 200 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 10% to 20% compared to last year. Cotton growth in Pingyuan Province is also better than last year. In the Northwest region, sowing was timely this spring, and cotton developed well in the early stages, with the flowering period generally one month earlier than last year. Although cotton in Shaanxi Province suffered from continuous rain in August, resulting in slight losses, it is still expected to increase by over 20% compared to last year. Cotton growth in Xinjiang and Gansu provinces is also better than last year. In the Northeast region, cotton may be slightly affected due to red spider infestations in July and August. Cotton in various provinces of the East China region is also reporting a bumper harvest. The unit area yield in Shandong Province is generally 20% higher than last year. Although coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were hit by typhoons in July and August, the impact was not significant. A good cotton harvest is also expected in the Southwest region this year. Although drought has reduced production in Hubei Province in the Central South region, cotton growth in Henan, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces is very good. A bumper harvest is assured in counties such as Shanxian and Lingbao in western Henan. The Zhengzhou and Huaiyang areas are expected to increase production by 20% compared to last year.

This year, under the principle of "concentrating efforts to increase unit area yield," cotton farmers in all cotton-producing areas across the country have generally organized themselves, widely learned from the advanced experience of cotton-growing labor model Qu Yaoli, and applied scientific cotton-growing techniques, resulting in significant improvements in cotton-growing technology. The density of cotton plants in most cotton-producing areas has gradually increased. For example, in the Yuncheng area of Shanxi Province, cotton fields have generally increased from over 2,000 plants per mu in the past to over 3,000 plants per mu. Light and frequent irrigation has been gradually promoted in areas with water irrigation. In the Jinghuiqu irrigation area of Shaanxi Province, 60% of the irrigated cotton fields have shifted from flood irrigation to small-ditch irrigation. In addition, topping has been widely promoted in Henan, Shandong, and other places; key promotion has also begun in southern cotton-growing areas. This year, governments at all levels in cotton-growing areas have also supplied a large amount of oilseed cake and chemical fertilizers. In addition to applying all farmyard manure, 63% of cotton fields have also applied topdressing fertilizer, which is one of the reasons for the bumper cotton harvest. Forty percent of the cotton fields in Shanxi Province and 80% of the cotton fields in Hebei Province have applied topdressing fertilizer. Most cotton-producing areas carried out autumn plowing and early spring harrowing last year, and the soil moisture in the cotton fields was very good, ensuring timely sowing and uniform emergence. In addition, rainfall was abundant in various places this spring, and cotton generally grew well. Although cotton aphids, red spiders, and other pests occurred during the growing season, due to good preparation work and relatively timely supply of pesticides and machinery, and the emphasis placed by governments at all levels on leading farmers to vigorously prevent and control pests, most areas were not harmed or suffered only minor damage. By the end of July, cotton was generally flowering and fruiting in various places. Although some areas were threatened by short-term droughts, floods, continuous rain, wind, and other disasters in August, these have all been successively resolved. At present, new cotton has been launched on the market one after another, and purchasing has begun in various parts of East China. In the Wu'an and Yongnian areas of Handan Prefecture in Hebei, about 70,000 to 80,000 jin of new cotton are launched on the market every day.

In order to further improve the patriotic production increase movement and cultivation techniques next year, cotton harvest evaluation and seed selection campaigns are being widely carried out in various places. Some local governments have organized visiting groups with technical cadres and labor models to visit and learn from various high-yield areas. Visiting groups from the Northwest, Southwest, and Anhui provinces have recently visited Qu Yaoli's hometown to observe and exchange experiences. Liaoxi Province has also organized farm cadres and labor models to visit Zhang Junhe's high-yield cotton fields in Yixian County.

    今年全国棉花可告丰收
    【新华社十六日讯】今年全国的棉花可以普遍丰收。目前华北区棉田已普遍开始收花，总产量将超过计划。山西省运城专区一带棉花生长特别良好，每亩水地平均可产籽棉三百斤，旱地平均每亩可产籽棉二百五十斤以上。河北省棉花一般比去年良好，肥乡县劳动模范张德芳家乡附近约有二十个村的旱地棉花，初步估计平均每亩可收籽棉二百斤以上，比去年增产一成到二成。平原省棉花生长也比去年为好。西北区今春播种及时，棉花早期发育良好，开花期一般比去年提早一月。陕西省棉花虽然在八月间遭受了阴雨侵袭，略有损失，但仍比去年增产二成以上。新疆、甘肃等省棉花生长亦较去年为好。东北区棉花因在七、八月间遭受红蜘蛛的危害，可能对产量稍有影响。华东区各省棉花亦告丰收。山东省单位面积产量一般比去年提高二成。江苏，浙江沿海一带在七、八月间虽曾受到台风袭击，但影响不大。今年西南区棉花亦可得到丰收。中南区虽然在湖北省因旱减产，但河南、江西、湖南等省棉花生长甚好。河南西部陕县、灵宝等县丰收已有把握。郑州、淮阳等专区比去年可增产二成。
    今年，全国各产棉区在“集中力量提高单位面积产量”的方针下，棉农们普遍组织起来，并广泛地学习了植棉劳动模范曲耀离的先进经验和应用了科学植棉技术，使植棉技术有很大改进。大部产棉区的棉株已逐渐加密，如山西省运城专区棉田一般已由过去每亩二千多株增加到三千株以上。有水灌溉的地区逐渐推行了轻浇勤浇。陕西省泾惠渠灌溉区棉田，今年已有百分之六十的水地，由过去的大水漫浇而改为小水沟灌。此外在河南、山东等地又广泛推行了整枝工作；南方棉区也开始重点推行。今年各地人民政府在棉区又都供应了大量的饼肥和化学肥料。棉田除全部施用了粗肥外，并有百分之六十三的棉田施用了细肥，成为棉花丰收的原因之一。山西省百分之四十的棉田，河北省有百分之八十的棉田都施用了追肥。各产棉区在去年大部进行了秋耕和早春耙地，棉田墒土很好，保证了及时播种，出苗整齐。加之今春各地雨水充沛，棉花普遍生长良好；生长期间虽有棉蚜、红蜘蛛和其他虫害发生，由于准备工作做得好，药械供应比较及时，各级人民政府重视领导农民大力防治，一般地区未受损害或损害轻微，到七月底各地棉花普遍开花结桃。八月间虽有部分地区短期内遭受旱、涝、阴雨、风等灾害的威胁，但均已先后解除。目前，各地新花已纷纷上市，华东各地已开秤收购。河北邯郸专区的武安、永年一带，每日上市新花约在七、八万斤以上。
    为了使明年的爱国增产运动和栽培技术更加提高，各地正普遍展开棉花丰收中的评比和选种运动。有些地区人民政府组织了有技术干部和劳动模范参加的参观团，到各丰产地区参观和学习。西北、西南和安徽省的参观团，最近都到曲耀离家乡观摩和交流经验。辽西省也组织了农场干部和劳动模范参观了义县张俊和的丰产棉田。
