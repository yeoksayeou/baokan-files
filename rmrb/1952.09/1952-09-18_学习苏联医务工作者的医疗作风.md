    Learning from the Medical Style of Soviet Medical Workers
    To the Editor: I want to tell you about the situation at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. Under the leadership of the Soviet Director, Comrade Frolov, this hospital, in just two or three months, not only improved its various systems but also cured many difficult and chronic illnesses. The hospital is filled with an atmosphere of mutual language learning. When the experts first arrived, they would greet patients with a mix of Chinese and Russian, asking, "How are you?" Later, they learned to say, "How do you feel?" Chinese doctors and translators, in order to meet the needs of their work, learned Russian with a spirit of rapid progress. Even the hospitalized patients, in such a mutual learning environment, learned a few phrases of Russian. Besides treating illnesses, this hospital sometimes feels like a school.
    In the internal medicine ward, there are elderly, middle-aged, young people, women, and children. There was a three-year-old child suffering from an eye disease that many hospitals couldn't cure. The child was almost blind, but after less than forty days of treatment at this hospital, his vision was completely restored. Every day, when the ophthalmology expert came to the child's ward, he would bring a piece of candy, a toy, or at least a flower. The neurology doctor always listened to the patients' conditions with a smile and examined them patiently. The director of internal medicine is a sixty-five-year-old man, whom everyone calls "Old Professor." He is indeed a knowledgeable, experienced, and kind elder. In addition to carefully listening to the patients' conditions and actively treating them, he also cares about everything concerning the patients. In the women's ward, there was a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl who was an orphan from the former Beijing Benevolence Hall. She had suffered all kinds of abuse and maltreatment from imperialist elements since she was a child and had a severe case of ascites, with a belly as big as a pregnant woman's. Many hospitals couldn't cure her, and she was only recently sent to this hospital. After being hospitalized, the director of internal medicine first gave her injections and then drained the fluid. A few days ago, he drained 3,700 cubic centimeters of fluid at once. She immediately felt better. The director of internal medicine told her, "You need nutrition. When will your mother and father come to see you?" She said, "I have neither mother nor father; I am an orphan." The director of internal medicine didn't say a word after hearing this, remained silent for a moment, and then left. The second time he came to the ward, he brought her many candies, pastries, chicken, and fish. From then on, the head nurse, translator, or nurses regularly brought her food. The girl was so moved that she almost cried. She said:
    "I have never seen such good days since I was born. The Old Professor is a Soviet, and I don't know how to thank him. I will always thank him and Stalin in my heart."
    Surgeon Sun fell ill and lived in the same ward as me. The Soviet director of surgery, neurology expert, director of internal medicine, head nurse, and nurses all came to visit him, comfort him, and encourage him. One brought a package of fruit, another brought a package of pastries. Their indescribable kindness made the patient feel infinitely gratified.
    When I went to the physiotherapy room for electrotherapy, I was always moved and educated. Here, five people can undergo various electrotherapy and hydrotherapy treatments simultaneously. The Soviet nurse, Comrade Asha, is in charge of the physiotherapy equipment. She works tirelessly from morning till night, treating more than a hundred people every day. During electrotherapy, she always rushes to the patient's side in her busy schedule, asking in a mix of Chinese and Russian, "Comrade, have?" (meaning, is there electric power?) "Good?" (meaning, how is the electricity?). When giving electrotherapy to children, she tries every means to coax them. After the electrotherapy, she always picks up the child, kisses them, and shakes their hand, saying:
    "Goodbye!" Their selfless spirit of responsibility towards their work is truly worthy of our learning.
                                                                                                        Ma Zhenwu

    学习苏联医务工作者的医疗作风
    编辑同志：我告诉你们北京苏联红十字医院的情况。这个医院在苏联院长甫罗哈洛夫同志的领导下，在短短的两三个月内，不仅健全了各种制度，而且治好了许多长年不愈的疑难大症。这个医院洋溢着一种互相学习语言的空气。专家们刚来的时候，见了患者，用一种半中半俄的口语问着：“您好？”后来就学着说：“您感觉怎么样？”中国大夫和翻译同志为了适应工作上的需要，用突击的精神，学习着俄文。住院的患者在这样一个相互学习的环境里，也学会了几句俄文。这个医院，除了治病以外，有时使人感到像个学校。
    在内科病房里，有老年、壮年、青年、妇女和小孩。有一个三岁的小孩患眼病，许多医院都治不好，几乎要失明，但是来到这个医院，经过不到四十天的治疗，完全恢复了光明。眼科专家每天到这小孩的病房时，不是带一点糖果，就是带一个玩具，至少也要带一朵鲜花来。神经科大夫每天都是笑容可掬地听取患者的病情，耐心地进行检查。内科主任是一个六十五岁的老人，大家都称呼他“老教授”。他确是一位学识渊博，经验丰富的忠厚长者。他除了细心地听取患者的病情，积极地进行治疗以外，并关心着患者的一切。女病房里有个十六、七岁的女孩子，她是前北京仁慈堂的孤儿，自小在仁慈堂里受尽帝国主义分子的摧残和虐待，患有严重的水臌病，肚子大得像孕妇一样，很多医院都治不好，这次才送到这个医院里来。住院以后，内科主任先给她注射，然后放水，前些日子，一次就放了三千七百公撮水。她立刻感到舒服了。内科主任告诉她说：“你需要营养。你的妈妈爸爸什么时候来看你？”她说：“我既没有妈妈，也没有爸爸，我是个孤儿。”内科主任听了以后，一声也没有响，缄默了一会儿就走了，第二次来病房时就给她带来了许多糖果、点心、鸡肉、鱼肉，从这以后，就经常地由护士长、翻译，或者护士给她送来吃的东西。这个女孩感动的几乎要哭起来，她说：
    “我从生下来就没有见过这样好的日子，老教授是苏联人，我不知怎样感谢他，我心里将永远地感谢他和斯大林。”
    外科孙大夫病了，同我住在一个病房里，苏联的外科主任神经科专家、内科主任和护士长、护士都纷纷地来探视他，慰问他，鼓励他，这个送来一包水果，那个送来一包点心，说不出的亲切，使患者感到无限的欣慰。
    当我到理疗室去烤电的时候，每次都受到感动和教育。这里可以同时有五个人进行各种不同的电疗和水疗，掌握理疗仪器的是苏联护士阿莎同志，她从早到晚紧张地工作着，每天要治疗一百多人，在电疗时，她总是在百忙中跑到患者的身旁，用一种半中半俄的口语问着：“同志，有没有？”（意思指有没有电的力量）“好不好？”（意思指电力如何）。给小孩烤电的时候，她用尽种种办法来哄孩子，烤完了电总是抱起小孩来吻一吻，握握手说：
    “再见！”他们这种忘我的对工作负责的精神，实在值得我们学习。  马振武
