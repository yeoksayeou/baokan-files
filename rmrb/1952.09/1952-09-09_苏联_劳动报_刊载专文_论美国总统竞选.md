Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 7th: The "Labor News" published a long article by Rabitzki, entitled "The American Election."

Rabitzki wrote that preparations for the presidential election in November of this year are in full swing in the United States.

The first stage is the nomination of presidential and vice-presidential candidates.

The tycoons of the Morgan, Rockefeller, and other financial giants' empires nominated General Eisenhower as their Republican candidate. These big shots are spending money without stint. According to the "Daily Mirror," more than twenty million dollars have already been spent on Eisenhower's nomination. They hope to recoup their investment by reaping hundreds of billions in profits if Eisenhower is elected president.

Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson was until recently a relatively unknown figure in American politics. Even in his home state of Illinois, he remained insignificant until four years ago, when his influential "friends" hyped him up and got him elected as governor of this large industrial state. Those who are interested in nominating Stevenson are the same people who nominated Eisenhower.

Therefore, the simple plan of the monopoly capitalists for the 1952 election can be expressed by the following formula: hope is pinned on Eisenhower, with Stevenson as a backup.

The candidates and party leaders of the two parties of American big business, in addition to engaging in minor squabbles to deceive voters, also engaged in various tricks and deals. These deals concern the distribution of future government fat jobs and obtaining more campaign funds from many industrial and financial giants.

Since the Republican and Democratic parties have the same masters, their campaign platforms have no essential differences in either international or domestic policy.

American monopoly capitalists have launched a noisy propaganda campaign, portraying the competition between the Democratic and Republican candidates as an "election struggle." The purpose of this propaganda is to deceive the general electorate, making them feel that there is no other choice but to vote for one of these two Wall Street parties. This is also the reason why the reactionary American newspapers and radio stations consistently refuse to report on the activities of progressive forces. However, American progressive forces are preparing to participate in the election under the slogan of fighting for the interests of the ordinary American people.

In early July, the Progressive Party held its Third National Congress in Chicago. The monopoly capitalists' newspapers, radio broadcasts, and television broadcasting companies did not mention it. However, the number of delegates who attended that congress was almost twice the total number of delegates who attended the Republican and Democratic national conventions. They demanded an immediate end to the Korean War, demanded that the US government agree to hold a five-power conference to resolve international differences, demanded an end to the expansion of armaments, restoration of normal international trade, protection of civil rights, abolition of the Taft-Hartley Act, the Smith Act, and other fascist laws. These demands and other democratic demands constitute the foundation of the Progressive Party's campaign platform, which is in line with the interests and hopes of the absolute majority of the American people.

As the election date approaches, persecution of democratic groups and progressives throughout the United States is intensifying.

However, the Progressive Party, regardless of terror and fascist persecution, is heroically conducting its election campaign, promoting its anti-fascist and anti-war platform to the people, thereby promoting the unity of all people who uphold peace and democracy.

    苏联“劳动报”刊载专文
    论美国总统竞选
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：“劳动报”刊载了拉比茨基的长篇文章，题目是“美国的竞选”。
    拉比茨基写道，今年十一月总统选举的准备工作正在美国如火如荼地展开。
    第一个阶段是提名总统和副总统候选人。
    摩根、洛克菲勒和其它金融巨头的帝国的大亨们，提名艾森豪威尔将军为他们的共和党的候选人。这些大人先生们化起钱来是毫无吝色的。据“每日镜报”估计，在艾森豪威尔的提名上已经化了两千万美元以上，艾森豪威尔如能当选总统，他们就能坐收千百亿的利润，他们希望这样来捞回本钱。
    民主党总统候选人史蒂文森不久以前还是在美国政治中比较不为人知道的人物。甚至在他的故乡伊利诺斯州，也是一直到四年以前，他的有势力的“朋友”为他大吹大擂而使他当选为这个大工业州的州长的时候，他才不再无声无嗅。对提名史蒂文森为候选人感兴趣的，也就是那些提名艾森豪威尔的人。
    因此，垄断资本家的一九五二年选举的简单计划，就可以用下面的公式来表示：希望寄托在艾森豪威尔身上，而以史蒂文森为后备。
    美国大企业的这两个党的候选人和党魁，除了相互进行小的争吵借以欺骗选民以外，还进行了各种各样的诡计和交易。这些交易关乎将来政府肥缺的分配，和从许多工业与金融巨头手中取得更多的竞选经费。
    由于共和、民主两党有着同一的主人，他们的竞选纲领无论在国际政策和国内政策上，都是没有本质上的差别的。
    美国垄断资本家发动了吵吵嚷嚷的宣传，把民主、共和两党候选人的竞争说成是“竞选斗争”，这种宣传的目的在于欺骗一般选民，使一般选民感觉除了投票支持这两个华尔街的党之中的一个以外，再没有别的选择了。美国反动报纸和广播电台所以一贯地拒绝报道进步力量的活动，原因也就在这里。然而，美国进步力量正在为美国普通人民的利益而奋斗的口号下，准备参加选举。
    七月初，进步党在芝加哥举行了第三届全国代表大会。垄断资本家的报纸以及无线电广播和电视广播公司，都没有提到。可是参加那次大会的代表人数，几乎等于参加共和、民主两党全国代表大会的代表总和的两倍。他们要求立即停止朝鲜战争，要求美国政府同意举行五大国会议以解决国际间的分歧，要求停止扩张军备、恢复正常国际贸易、保障公民权利、废除塔夫脱—哈特莱法、史密斯法和其他法西斯法律。这些要求和其他民主要求，构成了进步党竞选纲领的基础，进步党的竞选纲领是符合绝对大多数美国人民的利益和希望的。
    随着选举日期的逐渐接近，美国全国各地对民主团体和进步人士的迫害也日益加甚了。
    可是，进步党不顾恐怖和法西斯迫害，正在英勇地进行竞选运动，向人民宣传它的反对法西斯主义和战争的纲领，从而促使一切维护和平与民主的人们团结起来。
