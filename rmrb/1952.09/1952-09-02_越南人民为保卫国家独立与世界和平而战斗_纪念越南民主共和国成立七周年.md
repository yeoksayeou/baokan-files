    The Vietnamese People are Fighting to Defend National Independence and World Peace
    --Commemorating the Seventh Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Huang Wenhuan, Ambassadorial Representative of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China
    September 2nd this year marks the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people celebrate this historically significant major festival with boundless joy and excitement.
    The founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the long and arduous struggle of the Vietnamese people to defend their independence are inextricably linked to the struggle of people around the world to defend peace.
    Since being invaded by French colonialists, the Vietnamese people have fought bravely and unyieldingly, one after another, with the invaders. The entire history of the Vietnamese national liberation struggle is filled with these passionate and heroic historical events.
    After the First World War, the Vietnamese national liberation movement was deeply influenced by the great October Socialist Revolution and the Chinese Revolution; especially after the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party (i.e., the Dongyang Communist Party) in 1930, the Vietnamese national liberation movement, under the leadership of the Vietnamese working-class party, developed unprecedentedly and vigorously, and it became a part of the world revolution. During the Second World War, the Vietnamese people cooperated with the people of the world in the anti-fascist struggle, strengthened and developed their own strength, and fought heroically against the Japanese fascist bandits and the French colonialists who were willing to be Japanese lackeys. In 1941, the Vietnamese national united front—the "Vietnam Independence League" (referred to as the "Viet Minh")—was widely established throughout the country. In 1944, the Vietnamese People's Army was born, and at the beginning of 1945, people's power began to be established in six provinces of the North Vietnam liberated areas, and people's power and guerrilla bases were established in other areas such as Central Vietnam and South Vietnam. In August 1945, when the great Soviet army finally defeated the main force of the Japanese imperialist invading army, the Vietnamese people already had sufficient conditions to launch an armed general uprising to attack the Japanese invaders in order to victoriously seize national power. On September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh solemnly announced the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in front of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. In this way, Vietnam broke through the chains of imperialism and became an independent country.
    The imperialists were very unwilling to see Vietnam's independence. Therefore, their interference followed one after another. British troops and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, under the pretext of accepting the surrender of the Japanese army, successively occupied Vietnamese territory. At the instigation of US imperialism, the British imperialist army openly helped the French colonialist army reoccupy Saigon and attack the Vietnamese people's power in the areas south of the 16th parallel north latitude. In the area north of the 16th parallel north latitude, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army tried its best to support Vietnamese traitors to carry out sabotage and helped the French colonialists establish an invasion base in the northwest of North Vietnam, attempting to overthrow the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; but they were universally strongly resisted by the Vietnamese people. In order to maintain its suzerainty in Southeast Asian countries, and in order to carry out the anti-people civil war and maintain his reactionary rule, Chiang Kai-shek had no choice but to hand over the task of suppressing the Vietnamese revolution to the French colonialists and hurriedly withdraw his troops. Under the pressure of the Vietnamese people's anti-aggression struggle and the French people's anti-war movement, the French colonialists were forced to sign an agreement on March 6, 1946, recognizing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a free country. But this was just a delaying tactic of French imperialism. On December 19, 1946, they broke their promise and suddenly attacked Hanoi, and the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam broke out.
    After a year of war, the French colonialists' arrogant invasion conspiracy began to suffer a shameful defeat. This caused uneasiness to US imperialism. At the end of 1947, the US State Department sent former US Ambassador to France Bullitt to Hong Kong to collude with Vietnamese puppet Bao Dai, ordering him to return to Vietnam and put on a farce of "independence." In the winter of 1949, US imperialism, seeing that the Chinese mainland was about to be completely liberated, became even more blatant in its intervention in the Vietnam War. From October 1949 to March 1950, US imperialism dispatched a total of five so-called investigation groups to Indochina to carry out activities. Since then, economic and military delegations from the United States have been stationed in Saigon for a long time; on June 27, 1950, Truman ordered the US Seventh Fleet to illegally occupy China's Taiwan and openly clamored to strengthen interference in Vietnam's internal affairs.
    But the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated. They continue to advance bravely and strike the enemy. The Viet Bac campaign in 1947 shattered the imperialists' arrogant attempt to eliminate the main force and main base areas of the Vietnamese army in one fell swoop. The Cao Bằng-Lạng Sơn campaign in 1950 removed all the strongholds of the French colonialists in the area bordering China. This year's Spring Peace Campaign completely shattered the French aggressors' illusion of seeking military initiative. These continuous victories of the Vietnamese people have forced France to replace the Commander-in-Chief of the invasion of Vietnam five times, and redeployed five so-called High Commissioners to Vietnam, and the prime minister of the Vietnamese puppet cabinet, the running dog of French imperialism, has also been changed six times. Recently, the French-Vietnamese reactionaries actually put Nguyen Van Tam, the notorious spy chief who was spurned by the people of Vietnam, on the stage, but their failure was already doomed.
    Under the leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party and President Ho, the Vietnamese people are closely united within the Vietnam National United Front, fighting and building at the same time; they have achieved significant successes in political, economic, and cultural aspects. In the spring of 1950, China, the Soviet Union, and various People's Democratic countries successively established friendly diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, further enhancing the international status of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and strengthening the connection between the Vietnamese national independence struggle and the world peace and democracy camp.
    The Vietnamese people's resistance war is not only to defend the fruits of their more than 80 years of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; but also to strengthen the fighting forces of its two neighboring countries—Cambodia and Laos—who are jointly opposing the French colonialists. The Vietnamese people's struggle is also a great encouragement to other oppressed nations in Southeast Asia who are fighting for freedom and independence.
    The Vietnamese people's resistance war encourages the anti-French struggle of the people in various colonies ruled by French imperialism. On January 4 this year, former French Prime Minister Plevin said in the French Parliament in response to inquiries from members of parliament: "If we leave Hanoi, Saigon will not be safe, and after a period of time, I am afraid that we will not even exist in Diego Suarez (French Madagascar) and Bizerte (port in French Tunisia). One day we will be lonely and helpless, isolated on this small piece of land in Europe."
    The Vietnamese people's resistance war also contributes to the French people's struggle for peace, democracy, and autonomy. The French imperialists' war of aggression in Vietnam "has become a heavy burden on France." Regarding the consumption of military expenditure, according to former US Ambassador to France David Bruce, "The military expenditure consumed by France in Indochina has exceeded the huge amount of 2.8 billion US dollars provided by the United States in accordance with the 'Marshall Plan' and the 'Mutual Security Act'." As for the enemy's troop losses, it has reached 220,000, and the most serious loss is that France "in the Indochina" battlefield "the officers who die every year are more than those trained by the French Military Academy every year" (words of French Chief of Staff Juin). In order to solve the above-mentioned insurmountable difficulties, the only way for the French reactionaries is to further sell out the sovereignty of the French people in exchange for US aid; on the other hand, they intensify the suppression of the French people's patriotic movement, exploit the French people's blood and sweat, and force the French people to serve as cannon fodder. Therefore, the French people's opposition to aggression against Vietnam is also a major part of the French people's struggle for peace and independence.
    The Vietnamese people's resistance war has another important significance, which is to shatter the US imperialists' conspiracy to use Vietnam as a springboard to attack new China, the Soviet Union, and the peace and democracy camp. On March 13 this year, US Secretary of Defense Lovett's speech in the US Congress exposed the hideous face of the aggressors, saying that Vietnam "the strategic and geographical location of this region, as well as the extremely important raw materials it supplies--such as tin and rubber--make it very important for us to continue to effectively support France and the members of the Indochina Federation in their great efforts in Indochina to resist the 'aggression' of the Communists in the region." In January this year, French Far East Air Force Commander Seichin openly and arrogantly threatened in a magazine called "Indochina" that US giant aircraft carrying atomic bombs could take off from Vietnamese airports and attack the industrial areas of the Soviet Union and China. In order to realize this dream, the French colonialists and their running dogs are repairing old airports and building new airports for the United States, and handing over important ports such as Haiphong, Da Nang, and Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam to the United States for control. Now, the US and French imperialists are trying to step up preparations for aggression against Vietnam and the conspiracy to prepare for a new war. However, no matter what the imperialists' conspiracy is, the Vietnamese people must fight resolutely to the end to defend this forward position that defends Southeast Asia and world peace.
    The Vietnamese people deeply know how important their anti-aggression war is to the cause of defending world peace, and they also deeply know that the growing world peace movement helps their struggle for independence. Therefore, while actively attacking the French and US imperialist aggressors, the Vietnamese people have also actively participated in various international movements to defend peace. When China was not completely liberated and Vietnam was still in a state of encirclement, the Vietnamese people sent representatives across the enemy's blockade line to travel thousands of kilometers to participate in the World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Budapest in 1949, to participate in the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference held in Beijing in the winter of 1949 and the Asian Women's Conference held in Beijing in the spring of 1950. After the complete liberation of the Chinese mainland, the best model youths in Vietnam participated in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Berlin, and the Vietnamese people's delegation visited China and Korea, strengthening the friendship between the people of the three fraternal countries. The several peace conferences held in Warsaw, Vienna, and Berlin since 1950, as well as the International Conference for the Defense of Children held in Vienna in April this year, and the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing in June, also had representatives of the Vietnamese people participate. Under various difficult conditions, 5.3 million people in Vietnam have signed the Stockholm Declaration calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons, and 7.85 million people have signed the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty. Now, the Vietnamese people are actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and are enthusiastically carrying out the patriotic "killing enemies and making meritorious deeds, increasing production and practicing economy" competition movement, striving for more achievements as a gift to this great peace conference.
    The Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and defense of world peace still needs to go through a long and arduous struggle, but the Vietnamese people's struggle is a national resistance war under the leadership of the Vietnamese working class, and it is combined with the growing world people's movement to defend peace led by the Soviet Union, so the Vietnamese people will surely win the final and complete victory.

    越南人民为保卫国家独立与世界和平而战斗
    ——纪念越南民主共和国成立七周年
    越南民主共和国驻华代表团大使衔代表  黄文欢
    今年九月二日是越南民主共和国成立七周年纪念日。越南人民怀着无限欢愉和兴奋的心情来庆祝这个具有历史意义的重大节日。
    越南民主共和国的成立与越南人民为捍卫独立而进行的长期艰苦的斗争，是和全世界人民保卫和平的斗争密切不可分的。
    越南人民自从遭受到法国殖民者的侵略以后，就英勇不屈、前仆后继地和侵略者进行了坚决的战斗。整个越南民族解放斗争史上都写满了这些激昂壮烈的英雄史迹。
    第一次世界大战后，越南民族解放运动深受伟大的十月社会主义革命和中国大革命的影响；尤其是一九三○年印度支那共产党（即东洋共产党）成立以后，越南民族解放运动在越南工人阶级政党的领导下，有了空前蓬勃的发展，它已成为世界革命的一部分了。在第二次世界大战期间，越南人民配合了全世界人民的反法西斯斗争，壮大发展了自己的力量，和日本法西斯强盗以及甘为日本奴才的法国殖民者进行了英勇斗争。一九四一年，越南的民族统一阵线——“越南独立同盟”（简称“越盟”）在全国范围内广泛建立起来。一九四四年，越南人民军诞生了，一九四五年初人民政权开始在北越解放区的六个省份中建立，其他如中越、南越都建立了人民政权和游击根据地。一九四五年八月，当伟大的苏联军队最后击溃了日本帝国主义侵略军的主力时，越南人民就已具备了足够的条件来发动武装总起义，进攻日寇，以便胜利地夺取全国政权。一九四五年九月二日，胡志明主席在越南人民和全世界人民面前庄严地宣布了越南民主共和国的成立。这样，越南就突破了帝国主义的锁链而成为一个独立国家了。
    帝国主义者对越南的独立是很不甘心的。因而它们的干涉也就接踵而来了。英国军队和蒋介石匪帮的军队以接受日军投降为藉口，相继侵占越南领土。在美帝国主义的唆使下，英帝国主义军队公然在北纬十六度以南各地区帮助法国殖民者的军队重占西贡，进攻越南人民政权。而在北纬十六度以北地区，蒋介石匪军则竭力扶持越奸进行破坏，并帮助法国殖民者在北越的西北部建立侵略基地，妄图推翻越南民主共和国政府；但它们却普遍地遭受到越南人民的强烈抗击。英帝国主义为了要保持它在东南亚各国的宗主权；蒋介石为了要进行反人民的内战而保持他的反动统治，他们不得不把镇压越南革命的任务交给了法国殖民者而把军队匆匆撤走了。法国殖民者在越南人民的反侵略斗争和法国人民的反战运动的压力下，不得不在一九四六年三月六日被迫签订了一项协定，承认越南民主共和国为一个自由的国家。但这只是法帝国主义的一种缓兵之计，到了一九四六年十二月十九日，他们背信弃义地突然进攻河内，于是越南的全国抗战就随之爆发。
    经过一年的战争，法国殖民者狂妄的侵略阴谋开始遭受到可耻的失败。这引起了美帝国主义的不安。一九四七年底，美国国务院派遣前驻法国大使蒲立特前往香港勾结越南傀儡保大，令其返越粉墨登场，扮演了一幕“独立”丑剧。一九四九年冬，美帝国主义眼见中国大陆即将全部解放，因而对于越南战争的干预也就更形露骨。自一九四九年十月至一九五○年三月间，美帝国主义一共派遣了五个所谓调查团到印度支那去活动。此后美国的经济、军事等代表团就长驻西贡；一九五○年六月二十七日杜鲁门命令美国第七舰队非法占领中国台湾的同时，公开叫嚣着要加强对越南内政的干涉。
    但越南人民是不会被吓倒的，他们不断地奋勇前进，给敌人以打击。一九四七年的越北战役粉碎了帝国主义想一举消灭越南主力军和主要根据地的狂妄企图。一九五○年的高平——谅山战役拔除了法国殖民者在和中国交界地带的所有据点。今年春天的和平战役，彻底粉碎了法国侵略者想在军事上争取主动的幻想。越南人民连续获得的这些胜利，迫使法国五次撤换了侵越总司令，更调了五名所谓驻越高级专员，而法帝国主义的走狗越南傀儡内阁的首相也更动了六次。最近，法越反动派竟把被全越人民所唾弃的、罪恶昭彰的特务头子阮文心推上台来，但他们的失败却早已注定了。
    越南人民在越南劳动党和胡主席的领导下，紧密地团结在越南国民联合战线之内，一面抗战一面从事建设；在政治、经济、文化各方面都获得了重大的成就。一九五零年春，中国、苏联与各人民民主国家相继和越南民主共和国建立了友好的邦交，使越南民主共和国在国际间的地位更为提高，越南民族独立斗争和世界和平民主阵营的联系愈加密切。
    越南人民的抗战，不仅是为了保卫他们自己经过八十多年来反帝反封建斗争而获得的果实——越南民主共和国；而且也增强了正在共同反对法国殖民者的两个邻邦——高棉和寮国的战斗力量。越南人民的斗争对于为争取自由独立而斗争的东南亚其他被压迫民族，也是一个极大的鼓舞。
    越南人民的抗战鼓舞着被法帝国主义所统治的各殖民地人民的反法斗争。今年一月四日前法国总理普利文在法国议会中答复议员的质询时说：“假如我们离开河内，西贡也将不保，再经一个时期，恐怕我们连在第亚哥苏勒士（法属马达加斯加岛）、比塞大（法属突尼斯的港口）也不复存在了，有一天我们会孤苦伶仃无所依靠地孤立在欧洲这一小块土地上。”
    越南人民的抗战，同时也有助于法国人民的争取和平、民主、自主的斗争。法帝国主义在越南所进行的侵略战争“已成为法国的一个沉重负担”。关于军费的消耗，据前美国驻法的大使台维特·勃鲁斯说：“法国在印度支那所消耗的军费已超过美国按照‘马歇尔计划’和‘共同安全计划法案’所给予的二十八亿美元的援助的巨款了。”至于敌人兵员的损失已达二十二万人，而最严重的损失，是法国“在印度支那”战场上“每年死亡的军官，比法国军事学院每年所训练出来的还要多”（法国参谋长许温语）。为了要解决上述无法克服的困难，法国反动派唯一的方法就是更进一步地出卖法国人民的主权来换取美国的援助；而在另一方面则变本加厉地镇压法国人民的爱国运动，榨取法国人民的血汗，强迫法国人民充当炮灰。因此法国人民反对侵略越南也就是法国人民争取和平与独立的一个主要部分。
    越南人民的抗战还有一个重要的意义，就是粉碎了美帝国主义妄想利用越南作为跳板去进攻新中国、苏联，进攻和平民主阵营的阴谋。今年三月十三日美国国防部部长罗维特在美国国会的谈话把侵略者狰狞的面目暴露无遗，他说，越南“这个区域的战略和地理位置，以及它所供应的至为重要的原料——例如锡和橡胶等，使我们继续有效地支持法国和印度支那联邦成员国在印度支那为抵御该地区的共产党的‘侵略’而进行的巨大努力，成为非常重要的了。”今年一月间，法国远东空军司令赛辛在一本名为“印度支那”的杂志上公然狂妄地威胁说，载着原子弹的美国巨型飞机，可能从越南的飞机场起飞前往攻击苏联和中国的工业区。为了实现这个梦想，法国殖民者及其走狗正在为美国修复旧机场，建筑新机场，并把越南的海防，岘港和金兰湾等重要港口交给美国控制。现在，美法帝国主义正在企图加紧准备侵略越南与准备新战争的阴谋。但是，不管帝国主义的阴谋如何，越南人民一定要为保卫这个捍卫着东南亚与世界和平的前哨阵地而坚决战斗到底。
    越南人民深深知道他们的反侵略战争对于保卫世界和平事业是有着何等重大的意义，同时也深深知道世界保卫和平运动的日益壮大有助于他们的争取独立的斗争。因此，越南人民在积极打击法、美帝国主义侵略者的同时，他们也积极地参加了国际间各种保卫和平的运动。当中国还未完全解放，越南尚处在被包围状态的时候，越南人民就曾派遣代表越过敌人的封锁线经过了几千公里的路程去参加一九四九年在布达佩斯举行的世界青年与学生和平联欢节，参加了一九四九年冬在北京召开的亚澳工会代表会议和一九五○年春在北京召开的亚洲妇女代表会议。中国大陆完全解放后，越南最优秀的模范青年参加了在柏林召开的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节，越南人民代表团访问了中国和朝鲜，加强了三个兄弟国家人民间的友谊。一九五○年以来在华沙、维也纳和在柏林所召开的几次保卫和平会议以及今年四月间在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童会议，六月间在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议等，也都有越南人民的代表参加。越南人民在各种困难的条件下已有五百三十万人在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，七百八十五万人在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名。现在越南人民正在积极地筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议工作，热烈开展爱国主义的“杀敌立功、增产节约”的竞赛运动，争取更多的成绩以作为对这个伟大和平会议的献礼。
    越南人民争取国家独立与保卫世界和平的斗争，还须经过一个长期的艰苦的斗争历程，但是越南人民的斗争是在越南工人阶级领导下的全民抗战，它是和以苏联为首的、日益壮大的世界人民保卫和平运动结合在一起的，所以越南人民一定会赢得最后的彻底的胜利。
