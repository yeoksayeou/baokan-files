    Pay Attention to Reducing Stone Impurities in Raw Coal
    Comrade Editor: The Beijing Company of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has been dealing in coal for more than three years. In these three years, the company has picked out more than 5,000 tons of stones from lump coal and raw coal. These stones were purchased at the same price as coal in the past. Calculated at a minimum price of 200,000 yuan per ton of coal, the loss is about 1 billion yuan. If we add the labor cost of picking stones and the cost of transporting stones, the waste is even greater. I think that not only Beijing is like this, but similar situations may also exist in coal-producing areas across the country. Therefore, I would like to put forward the following two suggestions for relevant departments to consider:
    1. It is suggested that leading cadres of various coal mines earnestly correct the tendency of valuing weight over quality in production, educate workers to improve coal mining methods, and strive to eliminate or reduce stones and impurities in coal during the increase production and practice economy movement.
    2. The purchasing units of coal construction companies in various places should ensure the quality and quantity of coal purchases, strengthen inspection and stone picking work, so as to purify the quality of coal and reduce the waste of state property. Wang Ming

    注意减少原煤中的石块杂质
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司北京市公司经营煤炭已经三年多了。在这三年中，公司从块煤和原煤中拣出五千余吨石头来。这些石头过去都是用和煤一样的价钱购进的，每吨煤以最低价二十万元计算，损失约十亿余元，若再加上挑选石头的人工和外运石头的费用，浪费就更大了。我想不仅北京如此，全国各产煤地区也可能有类似情形。因此，我提出以下两点建议供有关部门参考：
    一、建议各煤矿的领导干部认真纠正生产中的重量不重质的偏向，教育工人改进采煤方法，在增产节约运动中努力消灭或减少煤内的石头和杂质。
    二、各地煤建公司的收购单位，对煤炭的采购应保质保量，加强检查和挑拣石头工作，使煤质纯洁，以减少国家资财的浪费。  王明
