To the Editor:

    The Health Department of the Fusong County People's Government in Liaodong Province held a health exhibition at the Cultural Center from June 12th to 17th, educating 6,811 people on patriotic hygiene, thus powerfully promoting the patriotic health movement throughout the county.

    The exhibition used models, objects, and charts to explain the sources and prevention methods of various infectious diseases, and also promoted scientific methods of childbirth to the masses.

    This exhibition was warmly welcomed by the masses. Some cadres reflected, "This is the first time such an exhibition has been seen in Fusong." Some residents of one street, after seeing the exhibition, complained, "Why didn't you let us see it first?" Some villagers said, "It's really good, all practical things that are a great help to us." While viewing the exhibits, the audience listened attentively to the explanations. If anyone didn't understand something, they would ask immediately. If they didn't remember after listening once, they would come back to see it again until they understood and remembered it before leaving.

    Because the masses received education, they had a correct understanding of the patriotic health movement and actively participated in it. For example, after seeing the poisonous insect exhibition, Ge Xingmin, a resident of Nanguan Street in the town, immediately reported the discovery of flies in a certain place to the person in charge of the exhibition and volunteered to lead the militiamen to eliminate them. Another example is that after seeing the propaganda posters about mosquitoes transmitting diseases, a resident group leader in the town went back and immediately filled in stagnant water ponds and actively mobilized the masses to carry out the patriotic health movement. Currently, every household in the town conducts a major hygiene inspection once a week, urging and promoting each other.

    Although the exhibition was short, it was basically successful due to the efforts of all health workers and the assistance of various agencies. It has provided favorable conditions for us to carry out the patriotic health movement in the future. We plan to hold similar small-scale exhibitions in rural areas in the future to better promote the patriotic health movement further.

### 辽东抚松县举办卫生展览会提高农民的卫生知识水平

    辽东抚松县举办卫生展览会提高农民的卫生知识水平
    编辑同志：辽东省抚松县人民政府卫生科从六月十二日到十七日在文化馆举办了卫生展览会，使六千八百十一人受到了爱国卫生的教育，因而有力地推动了全县的爱国卫生运动。
    展览会用模型、实物、挂图，说明各种传染病的来源和预防办法，并向群众宣传了科学接生法。
    这个展览会受到了群众的热烈欢迎。有的干部反映说：“像这样的展览会，在抚松还是第一次见到。”有的街道的群众先看了，另一个街道的群众就提意见说：“为什么不叫我们先看呢？”有的老乡说：“真好啊，都是实在事，对咱们帮助可大啦。”在参观展览品时，观众都是很静心地听着讲解，谁有不明白的地方就马上问；听了一遍没记住，又回来重看，等听明白、记住了才走。
    由于群众受到了教育，他们对爱国卫生运动有了正确的认识，并积极参加到这个运动中来。如城镇南关街居民葛兴民在看到毒虫展览会以后，马上就向展览会负责同志报告了某地发现蝇子的情况，并主动地要求领着民兵去把它们消灭。又如城镇某居民组长看见蚊子能传染疫病的宣传画以后，回去就动手填平了死水池，并积极发动群众开展爱国卫生运动。目前，该镇家家户户每星期都进行一次卫生大检查，彼此互相督促与推动。
    这次展览会的展出时间虽然很短，但由于全体卫生工作者的努力和各机关的协助，基本上是成功的。给我们今后开展爱国卫生运动提供了有利条件。我们准备今后在农村里也举办这样的小型展览会，更好地把爱国卫生运动向前推进一步。
