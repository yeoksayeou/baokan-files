Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Tokyo dispatch: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a message at the close of the 13th Diet session (July 31), instructing the entire party to strive to publicize the Japanese Communist Party's program and organize a peaceful and patriotic united front in the general election campaign.

The message pointed out: During the general election, the national political debate will focus on the question of whether to accept American rule, carry out rearmament involving war, mobilize and control industry, strengthen trade restriction policies, and implement conscription, or to oppose rearmament, strive for trade freedom, kick out American rule, and adopt a peaceful policy. The election puts the people at a crossroads: supporting the parties that favor war and national betrayal, or supporting the parties that favor peace and patriotism?

The message emphasized: It is important to thoroughly publicize our party's program and organize a national front including all peaceful and patriotic parties. It is possible for our party to establish "Peaceful, Democratic, and Patriotic Political Consultative Conferences" or "Peaceful, Democratic, and Patriotic Election Centers" with the greatest effort throughout the country. In some counties of the Sanindo region, the Tokaido, and Nagano, united election consultative conferences have in fact been established, and some places have obtained such organizations through the form of Peace Struggle Month and Peace Day. Consciously planning, organizing, and strengthening this organization nationwide is the urgent task at present.

The message finally called for the immediate establishment of an election system on the basis of national unity.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Tokyo dispatch: Under the instruction of US Ambassador to Japan Murphy, the Yoshida government is intensifying its persecution of the Japanese Communist Party and all patriots on the eve of the upcoming general election, attempting to prevent them from carrying out election campaigns.

On the same day that Yoshida announced the dissolution of the House of Representatives, Prosecutor General Sato nakedly declared: "During the general election, thoroughly crack down on the Communist Party." After Japanese Communist Party members of parliament, Yoshimichi Watanabe and Toshiko Karasawa, were illegally arrested in August, Akira Yonehara in Tottori Prefecture and Hachijūni Kazahaya in Tokyo's 4th district, both Communist Party members of parliament, were also placed under surveillance. In Kaneta Village, Tochigi Prefecture alone, more than 30 Communist Party members and Farmer-Labor Party members were arrested on the charge of "fighting against local governments."

The message said: Murphy and Yoshida's plan is to prevent even one candidate from the Japanese Communist Party and patriotic unity candidates from being elected. To achieve this goal, they are vigorously conducting propaganda to slander and vilify the Japanese Communist Party, and are also planning to suppress democratic newspapers and publications in Japan first, to test the reaction of the Japanese people, in order to declare the Communist Party illegal before the Senate election in May next year.

However, the Japanese people, who are fighting for national independence and peace under the leadership of the Communist Party, are actively preparing for the general election struggle, and the US-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy of persecution and obstruction will surely be defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st TASS dispatch from Tokyo: The Japan-Soviet Friendship Association issued a declaration calling on its members to support those candidates who are fighting to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union in the upcoming Japanese general election. The declaration pointed out: Faithfully reporting news from the Soviet Union and exposing anti-Soviet lies will make a significant contribution to the victory of peaceful forces in the election.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, Tokyo, 1st: "Soviet News" reported that a Japan-Soviet library in Tokyo recently opened.

    日共中央指导部就大选运动指示全党
    号召积极建立和平爱国统一战线
    美日反动派在大选前加紧迫害日共和一切爱国者
    【新华社三日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部曾在第十三次国会会议闭幕的时候（七月三十一日），发表文告，指示全党在大选运动中努力宣传日共的纲领，组织和平爱国的统一战线。
    文告指出：在大选进行时，国民的政治论争将集中于这样的问题上，即：是接受美国的统治，进行卷入战争的重整军备，动员并管制产业，加强限制贸易的政策，实施征兵制呢，还是反对重整军备，争取贸易自由，踢开美国的统治而采取和平政策呢。选举使人民站在这样一条歧路上：赞成战争和卖国的政党呢，还是赞成和平爱国的政党？
    文告强调说：重要的是彻底宣传我党的纲领和组织包括和平爱国各党派的国民战线。我党以最大的努力在全国各地建立“和平民主爱国政治协议会”或“和平民主爱国选举中心”是有可能的。在山阴道各县、东海道、长野的某些地方事实上已经争取成立了统一选举协议会，某些地方通过和平斗争月、和平节的形式获得了这种组织。有意识地在全国筹划、组织和加强这种组织是目前的紧急任务。
    文告最后并号召在国民统一的基础上立即建立选举体制。
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息，吉田政府在美国驻日大使墨菲的指使下，在即将举行大选的前夕加紧迫害日本共产党和一切爱国者，企图阻挠他们进行竞选活动。
    就在吉田宣布解散众议院的同一天，检事总长佐藤赤裸裸地宣称：“大选时，彻底取缔共产党”。日本共产党议员渡边义通和柄泽敏子两人先后在八月被非法逮捕后，鸟取县的米原昶和东京第四区的风早八十二这两位共产党议员也受到监视。仅在櫔木县金田村一地，就有共产党员和劳农党员三十多人被捕，罪名是“与地方政府作斗争”。
    消息说：墨菲与吉田的计划是不让日本共产党候选人和爱国统一候选人有一个当选。为了达到这个目的，他们一面大力进行关于日本共产党的造谣诬蔑的宣传，同时正打算先镇压日本的民主报纸和出版物，试探日本人民的反应，以便在明年五月参议院选举以前宣布共产党为非法。
    但是，为民族独立与和平而斗争的日本人民已在共产党领导下积极准备大选斗争，美日反动派的迫害与阻挠的阴谋定将遭受失败。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社东京一日讯：日苏亲善协会发表了一项宣言，号召该会会员在即将举行的日本大选中支持那些为建立对苏友好关系而奋斗的候选人。宣言指出：忠实报道苏联的消息并揭穿反苏的谎言，对于和平势力在选举中获得胜利这一点，将有重大的贡献。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社东京一日电：“苏联新闻”报道，东京的一个日苏图书馆最近开放了。
