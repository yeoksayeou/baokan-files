Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th—The broad masses of workers in Northeast China have enthusiastically responded to the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions' call on September 1st, and have universally launched a patriotic production competition to greet National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Northeast Machine Factory No. 1 and No. 2, Electric Engineering Factory No. 3, No. 7, and No. 15, Paper Mill No. 6, Rubber Factory No. 4 and No. 5, Shenyang Textile Factory, Chemical Factory, Asbestos Tile Factory, Wafangdian Textile Factory, and Jinzhou Vehicle Section, among other units, have successively held mobilization meetings and put forward their September competition targets. In the competition, workers in various factories and mines are paying special attention to product quality, safe production, and vigorously promoting advanced experiences to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state's production plan and the increase production and practice economy plan. For example, Electric Engineering Factory No. 7 and No. 8 have promoted the advanced experience of Electric Engineering Factory No. 5 in completing the production plan on a daily basis to achieve balanced production. In order to improve product quality, Garment Factory No. 3 launched the "Quality All-Red" competition, requiring a 19% increase over the state plan in September. Machine Factory No. 3 also requested that the rate of first-class products be increased to 90% in the September competition, and at the same time, the 91 second-class products produced in July and August should be processed and modified into first-class products. Under the enthusiastic encouragement of "For the Motherland, For Peace," the workers of various factories and mines have highly developed their labor enthusiasm and creativity, so new production achievements are constantly emerging. For example, Chen Guocai, a young worker in the casting workshop of Electric Engineering Factory No. 5, improved the small core of the axle box, increasing work efficiency by nearly 70%. He Shouyi, an old worker in the transformer workshop, successfully researched a baffle for the punch press, doubling work efficiency, achieving a 100% product qualification rate, and also saving the stamping die.

    Workers in various basic construction departments in Northeast China have also enthusiastically launched a patriotic production competition movement. The No. 12 construction site of the No. 5 Engineering Department of the Northeast Industry Department promoted the construction methods of bricklaying with double-handed slurry extrusion and parallel flow operation in the competition, which greatly improved the progress and quality of the project. All the workers at this construction site confidently proposed: to guarantee the completion of 90% of the annual project plan in September. Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy competition this year, the workers of a construction site in Harbin have saved the country wealth worth 1,473 tons of grain (equivalent to 635,000 yuan per ton), and have guaranteed the progress and quality of the project. In the competition to greet National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, all the workers at this construction site have put forward the guarantee to complete the project construction task 15 days ahead of schedule.

    东北职工热烈展开爱国生产竞赛
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北各地广大职工群众，热烈响应东北总工会九月一日的号召，普遍展开了爱国生产竞赛，迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。东北机器一厂、二厂，电工三厂、七厂、十五厂，造纸六厂，橡胶四厂、五厂，沈阳纺织厂，化工厂，石绵瓦厂，瓦房店纺织厂和锦州车辆段等单位，都先后举行了动员会，提出了九月份的竞赛目标。在竞赛中，各厂矿职工都特别注意产品质量，安全生产和大力推广先进经验，以保证全面地完成国家生产计划和增产节约计划。如电工七厂和八厂已推广了电工五厂按日度完成生产计划进行均衡生产的先进经验。被服三厂为了提高产品质量，开展了“质量满堂红”竞赛，要求在九月份超过国家计划百分之十九。机器三厂也要求在九月份的竞赛中把一级产品的比率提高到百分之九十，同时把七、八月份出产的九十一台二级产品加工修改成一级产品。在“为了祖国，为了和平”的热情鼓舞下，各厂矿职工都高度发挥了劳动积极性和创造性，所以不断出现新的生产成绩。如电工五厂铸造车间青年工人陈国财，改进轴箱小芯，使工作效率提高将近百分之七十。变压器车间老工人何守义研究冲床用档板成功，工作效率提高一倍，产品合格率达到百分之百，还节省了冲模。
    东北各基本建设部门的职工也热烈地展开了爱国生产竞赛运动。东北工业部第五工程处第十二工地，在竞赛中推广了双手挤浆砌砖法和平行流水作业的施工方法，使工程进度和工程质量大大提高。这个工地的全体职工满怀信心地提出：要在九月份保证完成全年工程计划的百分之九十。哈尔滨某工地职工，从今年开展增产节约竞赛以来，已为国家节省了价值一千四百七十三吨粮食（每吨折合人民币六十三万五千元）的财富，并保证了工程的进度和质量。在迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的竞赛中，这个工地的全体职工更提出了提前十五天完成工程建设任务的保证。
