Title: The U.S. Side Again Uses the Negotiation Conference Area to Carry Out Espionage and Sabotage Activities

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 14th: The Panmunjom Korean Armistice Negotiation Conference Area is being used by the U.S. side with increasing frequency as a conduit for their spies to enter our area. On the evening of the 11th, another Kuomintang agent of the U.S. side, taking advantage of the neutralized conference area, drove a hijacked truck through Panmunjom and returned to the U.S. position under the reception of the U.S. military police.

The reporter has just learned from relevant sources that after the agent and another agent who came with him sneaked into our area, they were soon discovered by our side. They then took a risk, killed a volunteer army truck driver on the highway from Sariwon to Kaesong, put on the volunteer army uniform taken from the driver, and drove his truck to escape towards Kaesong. After the agent left the other agent in the Kaesong area, he continued to flee towards Panmunjom, hitting and injuring a volunteer army guard on the highway from Kaesong to Panmunjom, and rushed towards Panmunjom. After making a hand gesture signal with the U.S. military police in the conference area, he drove into the U.S.-occupied area without any obstruction.

The U.S. military police in the Panmunjom conference area obviously received instructions in advance to receive the agent. A U.S. military policeman stationed at the border between the conference area and the U.S. position told U.S. reporters: "I could see that it was a Communist car. I saw him drive along the road at a very high speed, so I raised the roadblock and let him pass." Anyone with a little common sense would know that a sentry would never allow a truck that is clearly an enemy to drive into his own position.

In fact, the U.S. side has been using the conference area for espionage activities for a long time. In October last year, Korean child Kim Won-ki stated in front of many reporters from both sides how he was instructed and lured by the U.S. troops and carried into the Kaesong neutral zone by the U.S. delegation for espionage activities. This is just one of the more prominent examples among many.

U.S. Chief Representative Harrison is obviously more interested in the U.S. espionage activities in Panmunjom than in the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom. After the general meeting on the 12th, he greatly publicized the incident on the 11th to reporters, falsely claiming that our personnel had "surrendered" through Panmunjom. At the same time, Harrison openly stated that the U.S. side would continue to use Panmunjom as a transfer station for spies. Because the U.S. side's claim to detain prisoners of war has completely failed and cannot be salvaged, the likes of Harrison have degenerated to the point of fantasizing about using the incident of their dispatched spies sneaking across the conference area to prove the legitimacy of their detention of prisoners of war. However, this kind of lie from the U.S. side cannot deceive anyone, and can only show the U.S. side's despicable shamelessness and futile efforts.

### 美方又利用谈判会场区进行特务破坏活动

    美方又利用谈判会场区进行特务破坏活动
    【新华社开城十四日电】板门店朝鲜停战谈判会场区，正被美方愈来愈频繁地用作他们特务出入我方地区的孔道。十一日晚间，又有一名美方的国民党特务，利用中立化的会场区，驾驶一辆劫夺来的卡车冲过板门店，在美方军事警察接应下回到美方阵地。
    记者顷自有关方面获悉：该特务及另一同来的特务在潜来我方地区后不久，即为我方发觉，于是挺而走险，在沙里院至开城的公路上，打死我志愿军卡车司机一名，穿上从那个司机身上脱下的志愿军军服，驾着他的卡车向开城方向潜逃。该特务在开城地区留下另一特务后，即继续向板门店方面逃走，在开城到板门店的公路上撞伤我志愿军警卫人员一人，夺路奔向板门店。在会场区与美方军事警察作一手势暗号后，即毫无阻碍地驶入美方占领地区。
    板门店会场区的美方军事警察，显然事先得到了接应特务的指示。在会场区与美方阵地交界处站岗的美方军事警察对美方记者说：“我可以看出那是一辆共产党的车子。我看到他用很高的速度顺路开来，我就拉起路障，让他过去。”稍有常识的人都会知道：哨兵是一定不会让一辆明知是敌方的卡车驶入自己阵地的。
    事实上，美方利用会场区进行特务活动，由来已久。去年十月，朝鲜儿童金元基曾在双方记者多人面前，陈述了他在美方部队指使诱骗下，由美方代表团人员携入开城中立区进行特务活动的经过情形，这仅仅是许多事例中较显著的一个而已。
    美方首席代表哈利逊，对板门店的美方特务活动，显然比对板门店的停战谈判更有兴趣。十二日大会以后，他对记者大事渲染十一日的事件，谎称是我方人员通过板门店“投降”。同时，哈利逊更公然表示美方将继续把板门店用作特务转运站的意图。由于美方扣留战俘的主张已经彻底破产，无可挽救，哈利逊之流堕落到了妄想利用他们所派遣的特务偷越会场区的事件来证明他们扣留战俘的正当性。然而，美方这种谎话是骗不了任何人的，这只能显示出美方的卑劣无耻、心劳日拙而已。
