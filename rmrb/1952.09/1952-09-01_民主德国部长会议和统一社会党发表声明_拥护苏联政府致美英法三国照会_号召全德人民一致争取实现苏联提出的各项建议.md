Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 31st: According to TASS, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on August 28th, expressing a warm welcome to the Soviet government's note of August 23rd to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany.

The statement said: "The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic hails the new proposals put forward by the Soviet government in its note of August 23, 1952, to the governments of the Western countries. The vast majority of the German people wholeheartedly agree with the recent steps taken by the Soviet government, because these steps enable the German question to be resolved peacefully and quickly. In contrast, the ratification of the militaristic 'General Treaty' imposed on West Germany by the United States, Britain, and France would be an extremely serious threat to the vital interests of the German people."

The statement expressed support for the Soviet note's proposal to hold a four-power conference no later than October to discuss the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of an all-German government, the holding of free all-German elections, and the date for the withdrawal of occupation troops from Germany. The statement also welcomed the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to attend the conference. The statement said that the government of the German Democratic Republic is prepared to appoint appropriate representatives. The statement also expressed complete agreement with the Soviet note's proposal that a commission composed of Germans should investigate the conditions for holding free elections in Germany, and decided to recommend that the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic express its own attitude towards the Soviet government's proposal and adopt corresponding resolutions.

The statement detailed the reasons on which the government of the German Democratic Republic based its attitude. It emphasized that the militaristic "General Treaty" is hostile to the national interests of the German people and threatens the cause of peace. Its purpose is to obstruct the unification of Germany and the establishment of an independent all-German government, and to prolong the occupation of West Germany by Western countries indefinitely, thereby using West Germany for the aggressive purposes of the North Atlantic bloc. The statement pointed out that only on the basis of the Soviet government's selfless new proposals can the German issue be resolved peacefully at an early date.

The statement called on all patriotic elements in West Germany, especially those in the West German political parties and the Bonn Bundestag, to prevent the ratification of the militaristic "General Treaty" and to be determined to work for a peaceful solution to the German question. In this way, it is necessary to pass corresponding resolutions in West Germany to appoint representatives to attend the all-German election investigation commission and the four-power conference proposed by the Soviet government.

The statement said with confidence: "If all German patriots take firm action, they will be able to immediately embark on the road of peaceful unification of Germany, thereby safeguarding peace in Europe."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 28th: According to the German News Agency, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a statement welcoming the Soviet government's note of August 23rd to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany.

The statement said: This note points out the only concrete way to conclude a peace treaty and reunify Germany.

The statement denounced the Bonn Treaty as an open war treaty, which, as the Soviet note pointed out, aims at the national and social enslavement of West Germany; the Western countries' evasion of four-power negotiations is to maintain their position of strength in West Germany. The statement agreed with the Soviet government's view that the nature of the Bonn Treaty is hostile to Germany.

The statement said: "Seven years after the end of the war, the German people demand the final conclusion of a peace treaty. They demand the establishment of an all-German democratic government, and demand that East and West Germans reach an understanding on the issue of holding free all-German elections.

The German people believe that they themselves have the right to decide on the question of whether there are conditions for holding free all-German elections in Germany.

The German people demand that the four powers definitively determine the date for the withdrawal of all occupation troops in order to restore Germany's independence and sovereignty. Therefore, they agree with the Soviet government's proposal to convene a four-power conference no later than October to discuss and decide on the above-mentioned major issues, and that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany send representatives to attend this conference. The German people welcome the Soviet government's proposal to simultaneously discuss the issue of concluding a peace treaty, the issue of establishing an all-German government, and the issue of holding free all-German elections. This is the only way to peacefully resolve the German question."

The statement said that if East and West Germans take resolute mass action to prevent the Bonn Bundestag from ratifying the Bonn War Treaty, the conference proposed by the Soviet government could be held sooner.

The statement called on: All patriotic Germans, at this critical juncture, unite and strive by all possible means to achieve the following goals:

All of Germany reaches an understanding on the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of Germany's unity!

Oppose the Bonn War Treaty—immediately convene a four-power conference to discuss a peaceful solution to the German question!

    民主德国部长会议和统一社会党发表声明
    拥护苏联政府致美英法三国照会
    号召全德人民一致争取实现苏联提出的各项建议
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林三十日讯：德意志民主共和国部长会议于八月二十八日发表声明，表示热烈欢迎苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会。
    声明说：“德意志民主共和国部长会议欢呼苏联政府在一九五二年八月二十三日致西方国家政府的照会中所提出的新建议。绝大多数德国人民都由衷地赞同苏联政府最近所采取的步骤，因为这一步骤使德国问题可以迅速得到和平解决。与此相反，批准美、英、法三国强加于西德的战争性的‘一般性条约’，则将是对于德国人民切身利益的极为严重的威胁。”
    声明表示拥护苏联照会中所提出的至迟在十月间召开四国会议的建议，会上应讨论拟订对德和约、成立全德政府和举行全德自由选举的问题以及从德国撤退占领军的日期的问题。声明并表示欢迎苏联所提出的邀请德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国的代表列席会议的建议。声明说：德意志民主共和国政府方面准备任命适当的代表。声明也表示完全赞同苏联照会中所提出的应由德国人自己组成调查在德国举行自由选举的条件的调查团的建议，并决定建议德意志民主共和国人民议会，对苏联政府的这个建议表示它自己的态度和通过相应的决议。
    声明详细说明了德意志民主共和国政府在表示自己的态度时所根据的理由。它着重指出：军国主义的“一般性条约”是敌视德国人民的民族利益并且威胁和平事业的，它的目的是阻挠德国的统一与阻挠成立独立的全德政府，并无限期地延长西方国家对西德的占领，从而利用西德达到北大西洋集团的侵略目的。声明指出：只有根据苏联政府大公无私的新建议，才能早日和平解决德国问题。
    声明号召西德的一切爱国分子，特别是西德各政党中与波恩联邦议会中的爱国分子，阻止批准战争性的“一般性条约”，并决心为和平解决德国问题而努力。这样，就有必要在西德通过相应的决议，任命代表出席全德选举调查团和苏联政府建议召开的四大国会议。
    声明满怀信心地说：“如果全体德国爱国分子都坚决行动起来，就能够立即走上和平统一德国，从而维护欧洲和平的道路。”
    【新华社三十一日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林二十八日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局发表声明欢迎苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府照会。
    声明说：这个照会指出了缔结和约与重新统一德国的唯一具体道路。
    声明斥责波恩条约是公开的战争条约，像苏联照会中所指出的，它的目的在于对西德实行民族与社会的奴役；西方国家逃避举行四大国谈判是为了保持它们在西德的实力地位。声明同意苏联政府的意见：波恩条约的性质是敌视德国的。
    声明说：“在战争结束七年以后，德国人民要求最后缔结和约。他们要求成立一个全德民主政府，要求东西部德国人就举行全德自由选举问题取得谅解。
    德国人民认为他们自己有权决定在德国有无举行全德自由选举的条件的问题。
    德国人民要求四大国肯定地确定撤退一切占领军的日期，以便恢复德国的独立与主权。因此，他们同意苏联政府所提出的建议：最迟在十月召开一次四国会议，讨论并决定上述重大问题，德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国派代表列席这次会议。德国人民欢迎苏联政府所提下述建议：同时讨论缔结和约问题、成立全德政府的问题及举行全德自由选举的问题，这是唯一的和平解决德国问题的办法。”
    声明说：如果东西部德国人采取坚决的群众行动阻止波恩联邦议会批准波恩战争条约，苏联政府建议召开的会议就可以更早一点举行。
    声明号召：一切爱国的德国人，在这个严重的关头团结起来，用一切可能的方法为达到下列目标而努力：
    全德就迅速缔结和约与恢复德国的统一取得谅解！
    反对波恩战争条约——立即召开四国会议讨论和平解决德国问题！
