Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Japanese worker representatives Kiyoshi Ozawa, Hiroki Kojima, youth representative Kinkichi Ogura, and student representative Shunpei Fukui, who were invited to China to participate in the May Day celebrations, jointly issued a written statement at a welcome meeting held by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the 21st. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Chinese working class, filled with the spirit of international friendship, invited representatives of Japanese workers, youth, and students to participate in the May Day celebrations. We, responding to the invitation of the Chinese working class, broke through the blatant obstruction of the US imperialists and the reactionary Yoshida government, and finally arrived in New China. Here, the working classes of China and Japan can shake hands firmly. This is a cause for joy and encouragement for the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, and it also deeply moves us who have been selected as representatives.

The US-Japanese reactionaries, fearing the strong unity of the Chinese and Japanese working classes and peoples who are struggling against war and aggression, violated the will of the Japanese workers and international good faith, obstructed the dispatch of representatives, and even illegally arrested and imprisoned fifteen representatives who wanted to overcome difficulties and come to China.

However, the fact that we have arrived in China proves that no force can prevent the international unity of the working class.

We extend our deepest respect to the Chinese working class, who, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved a great revolutionary victory and are now engaged in a heroic struggle to defend peace and build a new democracy. At the same time, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese working class for their support and assistance to the struggle of the Japanese working class and people, and for their kindness in inviting representatives to China.

The US imperialists, who are carrying out inhuman massacres in Korea and invading Chinese territory, illegally formulated the two treaties of San Francisco and the administrative agreement, colluding with the Japanese reactionaries to blatantly transform Japan into a military base and arsenal for aggression against Asia, rearming Japan, and driving the Japanese people to become cannon fodder and to become enemies with their Asian brothers.

The people of the whole country, led by the Japanese workers, are strengthening unity and fighting tenaciously in order to smash the conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries and strive for national liberation, peace, freedom, and prosperity.

We have also undertaken the will of those other representatives who were illegally prohibited from coming, and are willing to do our best to fight for the friendship and unity of the working classes and peoples of China and Japan. The brilliant victories and construction experience of the Chinese working class will become valuable lessons for the Japanese working class and people, and will bring them hope and confidence.

We firmly believe that these victories and experiences will become a force to further promote the friendly cooperation of Asian nations and strive for peace in Asia.

    日本工人青年和学生代表联名发表声明
    【新华社二十一日讯】应邀前来我国参加五一劳动节的日本工人代表小泽清、儿岛博基，青年代表小仓金吉和学生代表福井骏平，在中华全国总工会二十一日举行的欢迎会上联合发表书面声明。声明全文如下：
    中国工人阶级充满国际友爱的精神，邀请日本工人、青年、学生的代表参加五一劳动节。我们应中国工人阶级的邀请，突破了美帝国主义和吉田反动政府的蛮横阻挠，终于抵达了新中国。在这里，中日两国工人阶级能够紧紧地握手了。这是一件值得日本工人阶级和日本人民欢欣鼓舞的事，也是使被选为代表的我们深为感动的事。
    美日反动派惧怕为反对战争与侵略而斗争的中日两国工人阶级和人民的坚强团结，竟违背日本工人的意志和国际信义，阻挠派遣代表，甚至对想要突破困难前来中国的十五名代表加以非法逮捕投入狱中。
    但是我们抵达中国的这一件事实已经证明：任何力量都不能阻挠工人阶级的国际团结。
    我们对在毛泽东主席领导下获得了伟大的革命胜利、现在正为保卫和平及新民主主义建设而进行英勇斗争的中国工人阶级，谨致以最深的敬意。同时，对于中国工人阶级对日本工人阶级和人民的斗争的支持和援助，以及对邀请派遣代表到中国的厚意，谨表示衷心的感谢。
    在朝鲜进行惨无人道的屠杀并侵占中国领土的美帝国主义者，非法制定了旧金山的两个条约以及行政协定，勾结日本反动派，明目张胆地变日本为侵略亚洲的军事基地及兵工厂，重新武装日本，驱使日本人去当炮灰，去和亚洲的兄弟为敌。
    以日本工人为首的全国人民，为了粉碎美日反动派的阴谋，争取民族解放、和平、自由与繁荣，正加强统一，顽强地斗争着。
    我们也承担了那些被非法禁止而不能成行的其他代表们的意志，愿以全力为中日两国工人阶级和两国人民的友好和团结而奋斗。中国工人阶级的辉煌胜利和建设经验，将成为日本工人阶级和人民的宝贵的教训，并给他们带来了希望和信心。
    我们深信：这些胜利和经验，将成为进一步推进亚洲各民族的友好合作及争取亚洲和平的力量。全日本产业别工会会议代表
