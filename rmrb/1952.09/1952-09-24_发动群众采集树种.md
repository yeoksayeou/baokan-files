    Mobilize the Masses to Collect Tree Seeds
    To the Editor: To prevent disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and sand, it is necessary to plant a large number of trees and eliminate barren hills and wastelands. Many areas have now begun large-scale afforestation, and it is not enough to rely solely on state-owned nurseries to supply tree saplings. To solve this problem, the Jixi Afforestation Experimental Farm utilizes various organizations (people's schools, mutual aid groups, forestry cooperatives, etc.) to mobilize the masses to collect tree seeds themselves and propagate seedlings next to wells and fields. I think this method of mobilizing the masses to "collect seeds themselves, cultivate seedlings themselves, and afforest themselves" is very good and worthy of learning and adopting in various places. Now is the season for collecting tree seeds, and I would like to introduce the methods of collecting seeds for several main tree species suitable for planting in sandy wastelands: (1) Black locust: Seeds mature from late August to early September. When collecting, use a pole tied with a sickle to hook the seed pods down. After drying, put them in a cloth bag and use a stick to remove the seed coat (but it cannot be removed if it is not dry; do not use a millstone to crush them, to avoid damaging the seeds). Then dry them again, and use a winnow to remove unripe or insect-infested seeds, and store them in a dry, ventilated place. In this way, the seeds will have a strong germination rate. (2) Purple bush clover: The seeds mature in September, pick them by hand and dry them. (3) Chinese Arborvitae: Seeds mature from late September to early October. When the seeds turn brown and are about to crack, knock them down with a pole, dry them, shake out the seeds, and store them in a dry place. It has a strong germination rate and can be stored for two years. (4) Oak: Seeds mature and fall to the ground in mid-to-late September. Pick them up and soak them in water for one or two days to kill the insects inside the seeds, then you can sow them. When storing, first air dry them, then bury them in sand. Do not allow the seeds to dry out excessively.
    (5) Walnut: The fruit matures and falls to the ground between October and November. Choose the heavy ones, bury them in sand, and you can plant them the following spring. (6) Ailanthus: The fruit matures in September. Pick the fruit together with the small branches, remove the branches by hand, rub off the shells, take out the pure seeds, store them in bags, and place them in a dry place. It has a strong germination rate and can be stored for two years.

    发动群众采集树种
    编辑同志：为了防止水、旱、风、沙等灾害，必须大量植树造林消灭荒山荒地。现在许多地区已开始大规模造林，单靠公营苗圃供应树秧是不够的。为了解决这个问题，冀西造林实验场利用各种组织（民校、互助组、林业合作社等）发动群众自己采集树种，在井旁地边繁殖树苗。我认为这种发动群众“自采种、自育苗、自造林”的办法很好，值得各地学习采用。现在正是采集树种的季节，我把适合沙荒栽植的几种主要树种的采种方法介绍出来：（一）洋槐，种子在八月底至九月初成熟。采集时，用杆子绑上镰刀，把种子钩下来，晒干后，装在布袋里，用棍打去种子外壳（但不干是打不下来的，千万不要上碾子压，以免损坏种子），然后再晒干，用簸箕除去不熟的或虫蚀的种子，贮藏在干燥通风处。这样，树种发芽力就很强。（二）紫穗槐，九月里种子成熟，用手摘下来，晒干。（三）侧柏，种子在九月底至十月初成熟，当种子变成褐色将要裂开时，用杆子打落，晒干后抖出种子，藏在干燥地方。发芽力强，可保存二年。（四）橡棕，九月中下旬种子成熟落地，拾起来在水里浸一天或两天，把种子里的虫闷死就能播种。存放时，先晾干，再埋在沙土里。不要使种子过分干燥。
    （五）核桃，果实在十月至十一月间成熟落地。要选沉重的，埋在沙土里，第二年春就可种。（六）臭椿，九月间果实成熟，把果实连同小枝采下，用手除去枝条、揉去壳子，取出净种，收藏袋中，放在干燥地方。发芽力强，可保存二年。  杨柳青
