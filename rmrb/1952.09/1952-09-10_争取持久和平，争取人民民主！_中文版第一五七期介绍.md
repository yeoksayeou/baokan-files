Introduction to Issue 157 of the Chinese Edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"

The Chinese edition of Issue 157 of the Cominform's organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial titled "The Strike Movement in Capitalist Countries is Increasingly Surging." Important articles in this issue include: "The West German People's Struggle Against the Bonn Separate Treaty" by Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany; "Experiences in Mass Political Work in Czechoslovak Villages" by Jiří Urválek, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "Youth Work of the Hungarian Working People's Party" by Farkas Mihály, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party; "The Bulgarian Patriots' Struggle for Peace is Increasingly Strengthening" by Georgi Nadjakov, Chairman of the Bulgarian National Peace Committee, and others.

The editorial states: More and more people in capitalist countries are realizing from personal experience that the imperialist policies of their governments, which are preparing for new wars, are drastically reducing the living standards of all working people, while the monopoly capitalist groups' profiteering is increasing sharply. Today, the economic struggles of the proletariat are more frequently combined with political struggles. In the base camp of the reactionaries and imperialist aggression—the United States—the economic struggles and anti-war actions of the working people are expanding. The American working masses are opposing bills that suppress workers, opposing the militarization of the economy, striving to end the Korean War, opposing the policy of preparing for new wars, and opposing the fascization of the political system. Strikes in France, Italy, Britain, Japan, Germany, and Latin American countries are all related to opposition to the US imperialist policy of aggression. The editorial emphasizes: The surge in the workers' strike movement is a prominent proof of the further intensification of the general crisis of capitalism. The characteristics of the strikes are greater persistence, higher organization and discipline, and more resolute participation by the strikers; the working people are more capable of taking concerted action and closely uniting with people from all walks of life to fight together. The struggle of workers against individual employers or certain employers is increasingly turning into a serious struggle of the working people against monopoly groups and the imperialist state apparatus, and is increasingly taking the form of general strikes, drawing entire industrial sectors into the struggle, or developing into national strikes. The editorial concludes: The solidarity of the working class is an important weapon against the reactionaries' attack on the living standards of the working people, and it is also an important weapon to stop the threat of new wars. Wherever the division within the working class is overcome, the right-wing Social Democratic running dogs and reactionary trade union bosses are isolated, and the traitors and provocateurs are thoroughly exposed, the struggle of the working people will surely be victorious.

Reimann's article writes that the Bonn Separate Military Treaty signed by the leading group of the West German bourgeoisie is, in fact, turning West Germany into a US protectorate. The vast majority of the German people, the working people in cities and villages, and even a section of the bourgeoisie, have begun to recognize the serious dangers posed by this policy of preparing for war and dividing Germany. The right-wing Social Democratic leaders and the right-wing trade union leaders, under the orders of imperialism, are using superficial opposition to prevent the working class from taking action. However, the general members and activists of the Social Democratic Party are increasingly realizing that the working class must unite and act together, and that it is necessary to take actions outside of parliament to oppose the Bonn Separate Treaty and further overthrow the Adenauer government. In bourgeois circles, more and more people are gradually realizing that they must fight on a democratic basis for the peaceful reunification of Germany and for the conclusion of a peace treaty. Committees uniting residents from all walks of life, including the bourgeoisie and intellectuals, have been successively established in cities and villages. They are conducting a people's vote on the conclusion of a peace treaty and opposition to the "general treaty" of militarism, based on the call issued by the "Committee for Mutual Understanding of the German People." However, Reimann points out that the main shortcoming of the West German patriotic movement at present is that farmers have not fully participated in the work of the various committees, meetings, and representative conferences in this movement, even though they are, in fact, participating in the national liberation movement in various ways. After pointing out that the German Socialist Unity Party's second congress's decision on building socialism had opened up broad prospects for the West German people, Reimann put forward the following tasks that the German Communist Party should strive to achieve: 1. Advance bravely and do not lag behind the growth of the West German people's will to fight. Overcome opportunism, which is manifested in a lack of confidence in the masses' will to fight, as well as sectarianism towards ordinary members and working farmers of the Social Democratic Party. 2. Expand the party's contact surface. First of all, it is necessary to improve the party organization's work in enterprises and mass organizations. 3. Consolidate the party ranks. Constantly fight to implement the party's resolutions and constantly check the implementation of the resolutions in order to improve the party's ideological and organizational work. Always be vigilant to prevent the enemy from using terrorist means to attack the party.

Urválek's article points out that the advanced farmers of Czechoslovakia, following the example of the Soviet collective farmers, have embarked on the road of large-scale socialist cooperative production. In 1951, many agricultural cooperatives had considerable achievements. Although the cultivated area of agricultural cooperatives only accounted for 19% of the total cultivated land, they supplied 27% of the total grain on the market to the state. However, in addition to achievements, there are also some serious shortcomings. Therefore, the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee decided that various party organizations should convene work report meetings of agricultural cooperatives and meetings of the cooperative management committees, and at the same time strengthen mass political work during the meetings. These meetings extensively absorbed the participation of cooperative members and discussed in detail issues such as planning, organization of labor, work quota system, fair labor remuneration, the minimum daily workload for each able-bodied cooperative member, the value of workdays, and the organization of permanent labor groups. After discussions and criticisms at the meetings, the management committees of the cooperatives were strengthened, and the vigilance of the cooperative members was also improved. Secondly, hold open party branch meetings to report and discuss the international and domestic situation and work tasks, so that a close connection can be established between the party and the masses, and farmers can be more actively engaged in production. In all matters related to socialist construction in agriculture, mobilize party members and non-party employees in factories, as well as outstanding workers in cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and state farms, to carry out extensive and systematic propaganda work using cultural palaces, cinemas, and radios in rural areas. In rural areas where there are no agricultural cooperatives yet, establish harvest committees composed of middle and small farmers to discuss how to organize mutual aid and cooperation, and methods for the correct use of machinery, etc., in order to demonstrate the benefits of collective labor to individual farmers through planned and organized harvest work, and then absorb small and medium farmers to participate in agricultural cooperatives. Finally, one of the most successful ways to encourage working farmers to participate in cooperatives is for propagandists to hold talks in farmers' homes, where they answer all the questions that the farmers and their families are most interested in. Urválek concludes: Due to the improvement of the party organization's political work, the concept of cooperatives has gradually been understood by the broad masses of working farmers, thus becoming a force for socialist transformation in rural areas.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五七期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五七期已经出版。
    本期发表题为“资本主义国家的罢工运动日益高涨”的社论。本期刊载的重要文章有：德国共产党主席雷曼的“西德人民群众反对波恩单独条约的斗争”，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记乌尔的“捷克斯洛伐克农村中的群众政治工作经验”，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员法卡斯的“匈牙利劳动人民党的青年工作”，保加利亚全国和平委员会主席那德热科夫的“保加利亚爱国者争取和平的斗争日益加强”等。
    社论说：资本主义国家愈来愈多的人民正从亲身的经验认识到，他们的政府准备新战争的帝国主义政策，使全体劳动人民的生活水平大大下降，而独占资本家集团的暴利剧增。今天，无产阶级的经济斗争，更经常地和政治斗争结合在一起了。在反动派和帝国主义侵略的大本营——美国，劳动人民的经济斗争和反对战争的行动正在日益扩大。美国劳动人民群众正在反对镇压工人的法案，反对经济的军事化，争取结束朝鲜战争，反对准备新战争的政策和政体法西斯化。法国、意大利、英国、日本、德国以及拉丁美洲各国的罢工，都与反对美帝国主义的侵略政策关联着。社论强调说：工人罢工运动的高涨是资本主义总危机进一步尖锐化的突出证明。罢工的特点是有更大的坚持性、更高的组织性和纪律性，参加罢工的人都更加坚决；劳动人民更能采取一致的行动，并和各阶层人民紧密团结起来一同战斗。工人反对个别雇主或某些雇主的斗争，日益转变为劳动人民反对独占集团和帝国主义的国家机关的严重斗争，并且日益采取总罢工的形式，把整个整个的工业部门都卷进斗争中去，或者发展成为全国性的罢工了。社论最后说：工人阶级的团结一致是反对反动派进攻劳动人民生活水平的重要武器，也是制止新战争威胁的重要武器。不论在什么地方，只要克服了工人阶级内部的分裂现象，孤立了右翼社会党走狗和反动的工会头子，彻底揭露了叛逆和挑衅分子，劳动人民的斗争就一定取得胜利。
    雷曼的文章写道：西德资产阶级的领导集团签订的波恩单独军事条约，事实上是把西德变成美国的保护国。绝大多数的德国人民、城市和乡村的劳动人民、甚至一部分资产阶级，已开始认识了这种准备战争和分裂德国的政策所带来的严重危险。右翼社会民主党领袖们和右翼工会领袖们，在帝国主义的命令下，以表面反对的办法来阻止工人阶级的行动。但是，社会民主党的一般党员和积极分子，已经越来越认识到工人阶级必须团结起来一致行动，认识到必须采取议会以外的行动来反对波恩单独条约，并进而推翻阿登纳政府。在资产阶级的圈子里，越来越多的人们正在逐渐意识到必须在民主的基础上，为争取德国的和平统一和争取缔结和约而奋斗。团结着各阶层居民、包括资产阶级和知识分子在内的委员会，已在各城市和乡村相继成立。它们正在“争取德国人民相互了解委员会”所发出的号召的基础上，就争取缔结和约、反对军国主义的“一般性条约”进行人民投票。但是，雷曼指出：西德爱国运动目前的主要缺点，是农民在这个运动中没有充分地参加各委员会、会议和代表会议的工作，尽管事实上他们正在以各种方式参加民族解放运动。雷曼在指出了德国统一社会党第二届代表会议关于建设社会主义的决定给西德人民揭开了宽阔的前途以后，提出了德国共产党应该努力做到的下列几项工作：一、勇敢地前进，不要落后于西德人民群众的战斗意志的增长。克服表现在对群众的斗争意志缺乏信心的机会主义、以及对社会民主党的普通党员和劳动农民所表现的宗派主义。二、扩大党的接触面。首先，必须改进党组织在各企业和群众团体中的工作。三、巩固党的队伍。经常为执行党的决议而斗争，并经常检查决议的执行情况，以便改进党的思想工作和组织工作。时刻提高警惕，以防敌人用恐怖手段打击党。
    乌尔的文章指出：捷克斯洛伐克的先进农民遵循苏联集体农民的榜样，走上了大规模的社会主义合作生产的道路。一九五一年许多农业合作社都有了相当的成就。农业合作社的耕地面积虽然只占全部耕地的百分之十九，但它们供给国家的谷物却占市场上全部谷物的百分之二十七。但是除了成就之外，还存在一些严重的缺点。因此，党中央委员会书记处决定各个党组织召集农业合作社工作汇报会议及合作社管理委员会会议，并同时在会议期间加强群众政治工作。这些会议广泛吸收社员参加，详细讨论关于计划、劳动力的组织、工作定额制、公平的劳动报酬、每个有工作能力的合作社社员每日最低工作量、工作日的价值和组织永久劳动小组等问题。经过会上的讨论和批评以后，合作社的管理委员会加强了，合作社社员的警惕性也提高了。其次，召开公开的党支部大会，报告和讨论国际国内形势和工作任务，使党与群众之间建立密切的联系，并使农民更积极地生产。在一切有关农业的社会主义建设问题上，动员工厂的党员和非党职工，以及合作社、机器拖拉机站和国家农场的优秀工作者，利用农村中的文化宫、电影院和无线电等展开广泛和有系统的宣传鼓动工作。在还没有农业合作社的农村里，成立由中农、小农组成的收获委员会，讨论如何组织变工互助、正确使用机器的方法等问题，以有计划有组织的收获工作，向个体农民证明集体劳动的好处，然后吸收中小农民参加农业合作社。最后，鼓动劳动农民参加合作社的一种最成功的方式是宣传鼓动员在农民家中举行谈话会，在那里答复农民和他一家最感兴趣的一切问题。乌尔最后说：由于党组织的政治工作的改进，合作社这个观念已经逐渐为广大的劳动农民所体会，从而成为农村社会主义改造的力量。　　　　　　（新华社）
