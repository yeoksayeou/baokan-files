    Even with Poor Raw Cotton, the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Can Be Implemented
    Editor: Wang Shuzhen (a Youth League member), a piecing worker in the fine yarn group B of the Tianjin No. 4 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, managed to reduce her roller-lapping rate to 0.6 pounds (the lowest in the entire factory) despite the poor quality of the raw cotton, by consistently studying the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.
    When Wang Shuzhen first saw the poor quality of the raw cotton and the numerous broken yarn ends, she was very worried. She thought, "Perhaps the Hao Jianxiu Work Method can help me overcome this difficulty?" Therefore, she began to experiment. She would arrive at the factory half an hour before her shift to help the Group A workers with piecing and to thoroughly clean her work area. At the same time, she carefully observed where yarn breaks were likely to occur and under what circumstances they occurred most frequently, noting them all down. During her work, she mastered the cyclical pattern of patrolling from left to right, with each cycle taking approximately the same amount of time. When she discovered that the yarn on a particular spindle was constantly breaking, she would investigate whether the spindle was warped, whether there was cotton on the roller core, the roller sleeve core, or the roller sleeve itself, and whether there were cotton seeds on the small trumpet mouth. In short, she would always find the cause of the breakage and repair it promptly. If she could not repair it, she would break the yarn end and repair it during downtime. As a result, she fully mastered the regularity of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. On the first day of her experiment, her roller-lapping rate dropped to 0.9 pounds, and the next day it dropped to 0.6 pounds. After applying this experience, the other workers in her group, Li Shufang and Liu Suqing, also reduced their roller-lapping rates to 0.9 pounds.
    Currently, Wang Shuzhen is further consolidating the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and with her help, the workers in her group have also initially grasped the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Xue Wenguang

### 原棉不好，也能实行郝建秀工作法

    原棉不好，也能实行郝建秀工作法
    编辑同志：国营天津第四棉纺织厂细纱乙班接头工人王淑珍（青年团员），在原棉成份不好的情况下，由于坚持学习了郝建秀工作法，她的皮辊花率曾降低到零点六磅（全厂最低的）。
    王淑珍起初看到原棉成分不好，坏纱头多，心里很发愁。她想：“也许郝建秀工作法能帮助我克服这个困难吧？”于是，她就开始试验。在上班前半小时她就进厂，帮助甲班工友接头，并充分作好清洁工作。同时仔细地观察那些地方容易断头，什么情况下断头最多，都一一的记在心里。在她工作时，她掌握了从左到右的巡回规律，每次巡回时间都差不多。发现那个锭子上的纱头常断时，便研究锭子歪不歪；皮辊轴心、皮套轴心和皮套上有无棉花；小喇叭口上是否有棉籽。总之，她一定要找出断头的原因，及时加以修理。若实在修理不好，她便把这根头弄断，停车时再修理。因此，她完全掌握了郝建秀工作法的规律性。在开始试验的当天，她的皮辊花率降低到零点九磅，第二天便降低到零点六磅。同组的工人李淑芳和刘素清运用了这个经验后，皮辊花率也降低到零点九磅。
    目前王淑珍正在进一步巩固郝建秀工作法，她的小组的工人在她的帮助下，也已初步掌握了郝建秀工作法。  薛文广
