Promoting the Experience of Xishui County in Distributing Party Newspapers

The experience of the Propaganda Department of the Xishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province proves that the key to successfully distributing Party newspapers lies in the importance attached by the Party committee and in-depth publicity to cadres and the masses.

In addition to explaining in detail to district and township cadres the significance of "the serious problem is educating farmers," "to do a good job in production, we must do a good job in distributing Party newspapers," and "distributing one more newspaper is equivalent to having one more Party propagandist," the Xishui County Committee also had the head of its Propaganda Department give a special report on the distribution of Party newspapers at an enlarged county cadre meeting. This report explained the consistency between the distribution of Party newspapers and the central task, criticized the erroneous ideas existing in many cadres, such as "distribution work is a matter for the post office and cultural and educational workers," and "the distribution of Party newspapers is an extra burden." It also criticized the erroneous idea of the post office treating newspaper distribution as a "burden." The County Propaganda Department also arranged the distribution of Party newspapers among districts, townships, and organs through the county's propaganda representative conference.

In terms of methods for carrying out the distribution of Party newspapers, the Xishui County Committee adopted the principle of grasping the key points to drive the general, coordinating with the central task, and conducting full ideological mobilization according to the needs of the masses. Originally, many district and township cadres believed that engaging in distribution work in rural areas would "affect production" and should "wait until mutual aid teams are doing well." In response to this situation, the Xishui County Committee first focused on Jiming District, coordinating with the central task to carry out in-depth publicity. Wang Guohua of Chenfan Township used the method of comparing it to the land reform, using questions such as "should we strive for high yields" and "should we learn to read and write" to get through to the masses, making them truly understand the importance of reading newspapers. As a result, they mobilized the masses to engage in sideline occupations to solve the problem of newspaper fees, and the entire township subscribed to twenty-five newspapers, creating the county's highest record of one newspaper for every seventy-eight people. The County Committee praised and promoted the experience of Jiming District, and Jiming District, after summarizing its own experience, also challenged the entire county, guaranteeing to do this work even better.

In order to prevent formalism in the distribution process, the Xishui County Committee also adopted the method of improving cultural stations (transportation stations) and reading groups, solving the problem of the accumulation of newspapers in districts and townships and "having newspapers but not reading them," thereby ensuring the consolidation and development of the distribution of Party newspapers organizationally.

On July 25th, the Hubei Daily introduced this experience in an entire third-page article and called on all localities to promote this experience and further carry out the distribution of Party newspapers in a "short commentary." The newspaper also published the "Notice on Strengthening the Distribution of Party Newspapers" by the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The notice specifically required cadres of all organs to "treat the distribution of Party newspapers as a serious political task" and to ensure by the end of the year that newspapers "reach villages every day," "every village has newspapers," and "someone reads, someone listens, and someone understands."

The distribution of Party newspapers must be valued by local Party committees, and the scope of newspaper distribution must be continuously expanded through the ideological mobilization of cadres and the masses so that newspapers can penetrate into the masses without the occurrence of formalism. The experience of Xishui County in distributing Party newspapers proves this point and deserves the attention of all localities.

### 推广浠水县发行党报的经验

    推广浠水县发行党报的经验
    中共湖北省浠水县委宣传部的经验证明，党委重视，向干部和群众进行深入宣传，是做好党报发行工作的主要关键。
    浠水县委除向区乡干部详细说明“严重的问题是教育农民”、“要搞好生产必须搞好党报发行工作”、“多发行一份报纸就等于多了一个党的宣传员”等意义以外，并由县委宣传部长在县扩大干部会上专门作了关于党报发行工作的报告，说明党报发行工作与中心工作的一致性，批判了存在于不少干部中的错误思想，如认为“发行工作是邮局及文教工作同志的事”、“党报发行工作是搭头”等，同时也批判了邮局把报纸发行工作看作“负担”的错误思想。县委宣传部又通过全县宣传员代表大会，布置了区与区、乡与乡、机关与机关之间的党报发行工作。
    在开展党报发行工作的方法上，浠水县委采取了抓住重点，带动一般的原则，配合中心工作，根据群众要求，进行充分思想发动。原来不少区乡干部，认为在农村搞发行工作“要影响生产”，“等互助组搞好了再说”。浠水县委根据这一情况，先以鸡鸣区为重点，配合中心工作，深入宣传。陈畈乡王国华用比翻身的方法，用“该不该搞丰产”、“该不该学文化”等问题来打通群众思想，使群众真正懂得看报读报的重要性，于是发动群众搞副业解决了报费问题，全乡订了二十五份报，首创全县七十八人看一份报的最高纪录。县委表扬和推广了鸡鸣区的经验，而鸡鸣区在总结自己的经验后，也向全县挑战，保证把这一工作做得更好。
    浠水县委为了防止在发行中形式主义的现象，还采取健全文化站（交通站）和读报组的方法，解决了区乡积压报纸和“有报不看报”的问题，从而在组织上保证了党报发行工作的巩固和发展。
    七月二十五日湖北日报以第三版一整版的篇幅，介绍了这个经验，并在“短评”中号召各地推广这个经验，进一步开展党报发行工作。该报还发表了中共湖北省委宣传部“关于加强党报发行工作的通知”。通知中特别要求各机关干部“必须把发行党报工作当做一个严肃的政治任务”，并要在年底作到：报纸“逐日到村”，“村村有报”，“有人看，有人读，有人听”。
    党报的发行工作，必须获得各地党委的重视，必须通过干部和群众的思想发动来不断扩大报纸的发行范围，才能使报纸深入到群众中去，而又不致发生形式主义的现象。浠水县发行党报的经验证明了这一点，值得各地加以重视。
