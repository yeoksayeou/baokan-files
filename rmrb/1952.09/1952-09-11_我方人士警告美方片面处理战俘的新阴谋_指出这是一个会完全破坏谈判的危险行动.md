Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th -- The Li Seung-man puppet government has issued a deceitful statement saying that more than 26,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war have signed so-called "blood letters" requesting "their immediate release" in order to "most effectively use them" in the Korean War. This is further concrete evidence that the U.S. side, regardless of the agreement reached by both sides on ensuring the repatriation of prisoners of war to their homes to live peaceful lives, is plotting to unilaterally handle the prisoners of war and hand them over to the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to serve as cannon fodder. This also makes it clearer where the 27,000 personnel of our side captured previously unilaterally "released" as "civilians" by the U.S. side have gone.

Responsible persons here warned that this is a dangerous action that will completely disrupt the negotiations. The list of prisoners of war exchanged by both sides on December 18th of last year is the legitimate basis for the current negotiations on the remaining prisoner of war issue. Unilateral handling of the prisoners of war on this list will overturn this basis, thereby completely disrupting the negotiations. This would mean tearing up Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement agreed upon by both sides, which stipulate that both sides will repatriate all prisoners of war they hold, and that prisoners of war may not participate in war actions after being released and repatriated.

The so-called more than 20,000 personnel of our side captured who signed "blood letters" were obviously fabricated by Li Seung-man on the orders of his American masters. But the world is already familiar with the fabricated prisoner of war figures released by the U.S. side. These prisoners of war are being subjected to poison gas attacks, beatings, and shootings every day, but the U.S. side insists that they do not want to go home. Recent news leaked from the U.S. news blockade says that prisoners of war are being beaten to death and injured every day because they want to go home. Now the U.S. side has completely blocked news of the massacre of our side's prisoners of war it is holding, but the fact that the U.S. side killed and injured more than 120 prisoners of war in the past three weeks shows that the "blood letters" mentioned by Li Seung-man are completely false.

It is known that the Kuomintang and Li Seung-man gangs' secret agents tortured prisoners of war and subjected them to cruel torture to force them to sign these shameful "blood letters." Captured U.S. airborne agents have proven that the so-called "blood letters"—if such "blood letters" really exist—were fabricated by secret agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Seung-man gangs, who signed or fingerprinted them on behalf of the prisoners of war. The agents dipped the fingers of prisoners of war who had been beaten unconscious in the flowing blood and then forcibly pressed them onto these "blood letters."

### 我方人士警告美方片面处理战俘的新阴谋  指出这是一个会完全破坏谈判的危险行动

    我方人士警告美方片面处理战俘的新阴谋
    指出这是一个会完全破坏谈判的危险行动
    【新华社开城十日电】李承晚傀儡政府发表骗人的声明说：两万六千多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员已经签写了所谓“血书”，要求“立即释放他们”，以便“最有效地利用他们”进行朝鲜战争。这是另一个具体的证据，证明美方不顾双方达成的关于保证遣返战俘回家过和平生活的协议，而阴谋片面处理战俘，并把他们交给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰。这也使人更清楚地看到了在不久以前被美方列为“平民”片面“释放”的二万七千名我方被俘人员的下落。
    此间负责人士警告说：这是一个会完全破坏谈判的危险行动。双方在去年十二月十八日交换的战俘名单，是目前对剩下的战俘问题进行谈判的合法基础，片面处理这个名单上的战俘将推翻这个基础，从而完全破坏谈判。这将意味着撕毁双方商定的停战协定草案中的第五十一款和第五十二款，这两款规定双方遣返所拘留的全部战俘，并规定战俘在被释放和遣返后不得参加战争行动。
    所谓签写“血书”的两万多名我方被俘人员，显然是李承晚奉他的美国主子之命而捏造出来的。但是全世界对于美方发表的捏造的战俘数字已经很熟悉了，这些战俘正在天天遭受毒气袭击、挨打和枪杀，但美方硬说他们不愿回家。最近从美方新闻封锁中透露出来的消息说，战俘天天有人被打死打伤，因为他们想要回家。现在美方把屠杀它所拘留的我方被俘人员的消息又完全封锁了，但过去三周美方打死打伤战俘一百二十多人的事实，表明李承晚所说的“血书”完全是假的。
    人们知道，国民党和李承晚匪帮的特务拷打战俘并对他们施以酷刑，以迫使他们在这些可耻的“血书”上签名。被俘的美军空降特务已证明，所谓“血书”——如果确实有这种“血书”的话——是蒋介石和李承晚匪帮的特务捏造的，他们代战俘签字或打手印。特务把被打得不省人事的战俘的手指蘸在流出的血中，然后强行按印在这些“血书”上。
