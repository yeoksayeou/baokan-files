    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: After the close of the Second Korean National Congress for the Defense of Peace, the Korean people are working intensely to prepare for participation in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Korean delegation is currently organizing the opinions of people from all walks of life throughout Korea regarding the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and is preparing to bring various materials to Beijing. The Korean delegation will bring the "Letter to the Peace-Loving People of the World" adopted by the Second Korean National Congress for the Defense of Peace to Beijing and hand it over to Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. The Korean delegation, also entrusted by the Korean Federation of Literary and Art Organizations and others, will bring a large number of photos, charts, materials, and literary and artistic works to Beijing, preparing to introduce to the people of Asian and Pacific countries the heroic deeds of the Korean people in their just struggle against the American aggressors during the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and to expose the shocking and heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors in the Korean War, including irrefutable evidence of bacteriological warfare conducted by the American invading army in Korea.
    Tian Donghe, representative of the Korean Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and Secretary-General of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: People from all walks of life in Korea are welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with great enthusiasm. After the Second Korean National Congress for the Defense of Peace, the peace-supporting branches and sub-branches of factories, rural areas, organizations, schools, and mass organizations in Korea, under the direct leadership of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, have entered a climax in their discussions regarding the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Korean people clearly understand that their struggle for the unification, independence, and freedom of their motherland in resisting American aggression for more than two years is precisely a struggle to defend world peace, first and foremost to defend the peace of the Asian and Pacific regions and the safety of the people of all countries. The Korean people will, at this epoch-making major step in the struggle of the Asian people to defend peace, once again express to the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and all countries of the world their firm will and determination to fight to the end for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other Asian issues on a fair and reasonable basis.
