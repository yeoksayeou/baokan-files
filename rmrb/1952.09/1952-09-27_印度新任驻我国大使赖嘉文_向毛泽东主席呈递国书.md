Xinhua News Agency, September 26th:

    India's newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, Raghavan, accompanied by Minister Gokhale, First Secretaries Saifny and Shastri, Nanga, and attaché Bai Chunhui, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government at 10:00 a.m. on the 26th. Present at the occasion were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Central People's Government; Chen Jiakang, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department. Ambassador Raghavan delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong upon presenting his credentials, and Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a reply.

    Ambassador Raghavan's Eulogy:
    Your Excellency,
    I have the honor to present to Your Excellency the Letter of Credence from the President of the Republic of India, appointing me as Ambassador to your esteemed country. For anyone, representing India to China is no ordinary honor. These two great neighbors have had close cultural and commercial contacts and relations since almost the earliest periods of civilization. In our ancient and glorious days of peace, we had deep friendships with each other. It is fortunate that such glory has reappeared on the lands of both countries. In particular, a new glory has dawned. New India and New China have been born, and everything proves that the relations between these two ancient yet new countries will continue to develop into more enthusiastic, closer, and more friendly relations. The lives of the Chinese and Indian people are undergoing tremendous changes. These profound changes, although not—nor need they be—taking the same forms and routes, regions and environments, talents and personalities. Past history and current circumstances may determine the need to take different approaches in achieving the common goal of both countries for the happiness of the people and the peace and progress of the world. But in one thing, there seems to be no difference even in methods, that is, in cultivating each other's concerns and enhancing each other's friendship, we are following the same path. Across the oceans and over the mountains, China and India have already extended the hand of friendship to each other. The two countries have many things to offer each other and absorb from each other, and as Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Mr. Chairman, my sacred duty is to strive, with your support, to promote greater and closer exchanges between our two countries. I believe that in this great task, my humble efforts will receive your sympathy and understanding.

    Today, I bring to you the most sincere respect of the President of India, the Prime Minister of India, and the Government and people of India; this is not just general respect, but respect based on genuine admiration. Our country unanimously wishes Your Excellency, your government, and your people happiness, peace, and prosperity.

    Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply:
    Mr. Ambassador,
    I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence from the President of the Republic of India presented by Your Excellency, and I thank Your Excellency for your congratulations.

    Over the past two years, the friendly relations between China and India in economic and cultural fields have further developed. I believe that the friendly cooperation between our two peoples will be further enhanced and consolidated in the common cause of seeking peace in Asia and the world.

    I warmly welcome Your Excellency to take office as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of India to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to assist Your Excellency in strengthening the friendly cooperation between our two countries.

    I wish your country prosperity and your people prosperity, and I wish your head of state good health.

    向毛泽东主席呈递国书
    【新华社二十六日讯】印度共和国新任驻我国特命全权大使赖嘉文于二十六日上午十时偕公使高尔、一等秘书赛发尼、夏士德、南格及随员白春晖，向我中央人民政府毛泽东主席呈递国书。在场者有中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠、中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来、中国人民解放军代总参谋长聂荣臻、外交部办公厅主任王炳南、中央人民政府典礼局局长余心清、外交部亚洲司司长陈家康、交际处处长王倬如。赖嘉文大使在呈递国书时曾向毛泽东主席致颂词，毛泽东主席致答词。
    赖嘉文大使的颂词阁下：
    我荣幸地向阁下呈递印度共和国总统任命我为驻贵国大使的国书。对于任何人来说，代表印度出使中国，绝不是通常的光荣。这两大邻邦，几乎从最早的文明时期起，就有了文化上的商业上的密切接触与关系。在我们古代光荣的和平日子中，我们彼此间曾有深厚情谊。值得庆幸的事是，那样的光荣业已重现在两国的大地之上。尤其是新的光荣已现曙光。新印度与新中国已经诞生，一切都证明了这两个古老而又是新的国家之间的关系，将继续发展为更热烈、更亲密和更友好的关系。中印两国人民的生活正处于巨大的变革中。这些深刻的变革，虽然不是——亦不必是——采取同样的形式与路线、地域与环境、才智与性格。过去的历史与目前的情况在达成两国为人民的幸福以及全世界的和平与进步的同一目标时，可能决定需要采取不同的方法。但在一件事情上，似乎连方法也并无一点差异，即在我们培植彼此的关注与增进彼此的友谊上，我们是遵循同一的路线。跨过海洋，越过山岭，中、印两国业已彼此伸出了友谊之手。两国有许多事物可以互相奉献、互相吸收，而作为驻中华人民共和国的大使，主席先生，我的神圣的职责，就是在阁下的支持下，力图促进我们两国之间的更伟大和更亲密的交往。我相信，在这一伟大的职务中，我微薄的努力将会获得您的同情与谅解。
    今天，我带来了印度总统、印度总理及印度政府与人民的对您的最诚挚的敬意；这不仅是一般的敬意，而是基于真诚的爱慕而生的敬意。我国全国一致地敬祝阁下、贵国政府及贵国人民幸福、和平与繁荣。
    毛泽东主席的答词大使先生：
    我很高兴地接受贵大使呈递的印度共和国总统的国书，并感谢贵大使的祝贺。
    两年多来，中、印两国在经济、文化各方面的友好关系都有了进一步的发展。我相信：贵我两国人民的友好合作，在共同谋取亚洲及世界和平的事业中将会更加增进与巩固。
    我热烈地欢迎阁下出任印度共和国驻中华人民共和国的特命全权大使，并愿对贵大使加强两国友好合作的工作予以协助。
    谨祝贵国国家繁荣，人民兴旺，并祝贵国元首健康。
