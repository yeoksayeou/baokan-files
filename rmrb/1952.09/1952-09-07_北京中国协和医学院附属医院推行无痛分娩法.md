    Beijing China Union Medical College Hospital Promotes Painless Childbirth Method

    Editor: Lin Qiaozhi, Director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Beijing China Union Medical College Hospital, convened a meeting within the department for ideological mobilization after attending the Painless Childbirth Method Symposium held by the Central Ministry of Health on July 18th. In order to conduct experiments with a focus, a painless childbirth method promotion team was established within the hospital, and two physicians were sent to Tianjin Municipal General Hospital, Military Medical University, and Beijing Maternal and Child Health Experimental Institute to learn and gain experience. On the morning of August 2nd, obstetrics and gynecology physicians began giving prenatal lectures to the first group of pregnant women. On August 11th, the hospital officially began admitting pregnant women. As of August 29th, twenty-two cases had been successfully tested. Among them, one pregnant woman experienced pain for ten minutes after being admitted to the hospital due to arriving too late and being too nervous at home, but after entering the resting room and practicing abdominal breathing, the pain disappeared. Currently, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology is preparing with full confidence to apply the painless childbirth method to all pregnant women in the hospital starting in September.

    The rapid promotion of the painless childbirth method at Union Medical College demonstrates the tremendous changes in the thinking of the medical staff at Union Medical College after the ideological remolding movement. In the past, due to the influence of pro-American and worship-America ideologies, the promotion of organizational therapy encountered serious obstacles in the hospital. However, during the ideological remolding movement, the physicians in the hospital generally recognized the errors and harms of pro-American and worship-America ideologies, criticized the decadent bourgeois ideology, and began to recognize the superiority of Soviet science. At the same time, the physicians also criticized their past research attitudes and medical styles, recognizing that medical workers must serve the people and be "all for the sick and wounded." This created favorable conditions for the promotion of the painless childbirth method.

    北京中国协和医学院附属医院推行无痛分娩法
    编辑同志：北京中国协和医学院附属医院妇产科主任林巧稚医师，自七月十八日参加中央卫生部召开的无痛分娩法座谈会后，就在科内召开会议进行思想动员。为了有重点地进行实验，在院内成立了无痛分娩法推行小组，并派了两位医师，分头前往天津市立总医院、军医大学及北京妇幼保健实验院学习，吸取经验。八月二日上午妇产科医师开始给第一班产妇作产前讲课。八月十一日医院开始正式收容产妇。截至八月二十九日，已试行二十二例，获得成功。其中有一个产妇因来院过迟和在家时心里过于紧张，曾在入院后十分钟内感觉过疼痛，但进入休息室后，经腹部呼吸，疼痛即行消失。目前，妇产科正满怀信心地准备自九月份起把无痛分娩法用到该院的全体产妇中去。
    无痛分娩法在协和医学院的迅速推行，说明了协和医学院医务人员在思想改造运动以后的巨大变化。在过去，由于亲美、崇美思想的作祟，组织疗法的推行在该院曾遇到过严重阻碍。但在思想改造运动中，该院的医师们普遍认识了亲美崇美思想的错误及其危害性，批判了腐朽的资产阶级思想，开始认识到苏联科学的优越性。同时，医师们也批判了过去的研究态度和医疗作风，认识到医务工作者必须为人民服务，“一切为着伤病员”。这样就为推行无痛分娩法创造了良好条件。
