    Getting Organized is the Bright Road to Developing Production
    Comrade Editor: At the end of July, I participated in the field seed selection and evaluation team in the Second Village of Xianshui Township, Hengyang, Hunan. We saw that many rice plants were growing very well, and the masses were very enthusiastic about increasing production. There was a paddy field, about one mu in size, where the rice grew thick, tall, and neat. The evaluation team members all said, "This is really good rice!" This field was planted by Tang Yazi, a poor peasant. He is only seventeen years old this year, and his family consists of only an elderly mother and a little sister who is less than ten years old. Why did he cultivate his field so well? He said that he joined the mutual aid group this year, worked very actively, and learned a lot of techniques; the group helped him solve the difficulties of lacking labor and insufficient means of production, so his field was cultivated well. This year, he applied more than 100 dan of pond mud, 250 jin of manure, and 130 dan of ditch silt and miscellaneous fertilizer to this field. In terms of cultivation, he plowed three times and harrowed six times, and weeded three times, so the crops grew better than usual. Looking at the red flag flying in his field, I felt indescribably happy. Getting organized is indeed the bright road to developing production. Xiong Houyi

    组织起来是发展生产的光明大道
    编辑同志：七月底，我参加了湖南衡阳咸水乡二村的田间选种评比队。我们看到许多稻谷都长得很好，群众的增产热情很高。有一丘田，大约有一亩多，稻子长得粗高整齐，评比队员们都说：“真是好禾！”这丘田是贫农汤牙子种的。他今年才十七岁，家里只有一个老母亲和一个不到十岁的小妹妹。他的田为什么种得这么好呢？他说，他今年参加了互助组，劳动很积极，学会了不少技术；组里帮助他解决了缺乏劳力和生产资料不足的困难，所以他的田就种好了。今年他在这丘田里施了一百多担塘泥、二百五十斤大粪，一百三十担沟淤杂肥。在耕作方面，他做到了三犁六耙，除了三遍草，因此庄稼长得比常年好。我望着飘扬在他那丘田里的红旗，心理有说不出的愉快。组织起来确是发展生产的光明大道。　熊厚义
