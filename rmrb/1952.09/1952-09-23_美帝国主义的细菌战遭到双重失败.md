American imperialism's frantic launch of germ warfare in Korea and China was a delusion that epidemics could be made to rage in Korea and China, achieving mass murder to fulfill its ambition of aggression against Korea and China. However, American imperialists completely misjudged the great strength displayed by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party. Since the founding of New China, under the policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "prevention first," achievements in health have been unprecedented. Ninety-one point two percent of all counties in the country have established health centers, and health clinics and joint clinics have been organized in rural areas, and the regional responsibility doctor system has been promoted. About 50 percent of villages have health committee members, and the medical and health care network is particularly widespread in the Northeast region. The development of medical education is even more astonishing. In June 1951, the total number of medical students in higher medical and pharmaceutical colleges across the country exceeded the total number of doctors trained in the past 69 years. Regarding epidemic prevention work, for example:

In the three years after liberation, more than 300 million people were vaccinated nationwide, and smallpox has almost disappeared. No genuine case of cholera has occurred in the past three years. Plague is confined to only a few areas, and the incidence rate in 1950 was only 1 percent of that in 1947. The work of eradicating lice has been carried out thoroughly, preventing diseases transmitted by lice such as typhus and relapsing fever from spreading. Due to the popularization of fly eradication and drinking water disinfection, gastrointestinal infectious diseases have been greatly reduced. The masses have been mobilized, and the strength that medical and health workers could not exert in the reactionary government era has been brought into play in the new society, so the epidemic prevention work has achieved such great success. The experts of the International Scientific Commission who investigated the facts of germ warfare in Korea and China personally witnessed the current health situation of the Chinese people. In their report, they pointed out: "The health education movement carried out in China since liberation is perhaps unparalleled in its scope." "All the people, regardless of men, women, old or young, cooperate wholeheartedly." "Everything that should be done to continuously and rapidly improve the general standards of public health is thought of and done vigorously and thoroughly." "Today's progress in hygiene in China, and the active implementation of various hygiene measures, are precisely the hygiene measures that previous international hygiene organizations wanted to promote but could not achieve." Some medical scientists in capitalist countries, when the Chinese government exposed the heinous crime of American imperialism in conducting germ warfare, believed that the absence of major epidemics in China was evidence that American imperialism had not launched germ warfare. This is entirely due to their disregard for the leapfrog progress of China's health undertakings and the great strength of the Chinese people, so they have such an erroneous view. Imperialists will not repent until the very end of their defeat. Not only does it not admit its failure, but it repeatedly distorts and propagates that China's health situation is very poor, and nonsense that the epidemics found in the Northeast are "naturally occurring." When the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and Y. T. Wu, Fage, and Dean Johnson issued fair remarks and reported the facts of germ warfare, the American imperialists could not come up with contradictory facts to refute them, so they had to say: Lawyers, Y. T. Wu, Fage, and Dean Johnson are not specialized scientists and have no ability to discern the authenticity of evidence. Now, the experts of the International Scientific Committee, after conducting investigations and research with an objective and most rigorous scientific attitude, have confirmed that the American military has indeed used bacteriological weapons in many different ways since January 1952. American imperialists should have no excuse, but shamelessly say: "This is a fabricated fact." Its intention is naturally to deceive the kind people of the world in order to maintain its bankrupt war of aggression.

However, the fabricator is getting worse and worse, and this irrational sophistry is enough to expose its hypocritical and shameless face. It has repeatedly shown its essence of destroying peaceful people in front of the people of the world. The last fate of the imperialists who have suffered such a double defeat will inevitably lead to the road of destruction.

In order to save mankind and defend world peace, the people of the world should unite to sanction the crime of germ warfare by American imperialism.

    美帝国主义的细菌战遭到双重失败
    金宝善
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国疯狂地发动了细菌战，是妄想使瘟疫在朝鲜和中国流行，可以收到大批杀人的效果以达到它侵略朝中的野心。但是美帝国主义者完全错估了中国人民在共产党领导下所发挥的伟大力量。新中国成立以来，在“面向工农兵”“预防为主”的方针下，卫生事业的成就是空前的。全国总县数的百分之九一·二都建立了卫生院，农村中组织了卫生所、联合诊所，并推广了区域责任医师制。约百分之五十的乡村有了卫生委员，在东北地区医药卫生保健网尤为普遍。医学教育的发展更足惊人。一九五一年六月全国高级医、药院校在校医学生的总数超过了过去六十九年所训练出来的医生总数。现就防疫工作方面，举例来说：
    在解放后的三年中，全国种痘人数超过了三万万人，天花几乎绝迹。三年来未发生一真性霍乱病人。鼠疫只局限于少数地区，一九五○年的发病数字只有一九四七年的百分之一。灭虱工作作得很彻底，使斑疹伤寒和回归热等由虱传播的疾病无从流行。由于扑灭苍蝇工作和饮水消毒工作的普及，肠胃传染病已大大减少。群众发动起来了，医药卫生工作者在反动政府时代所不能发挥的力量都在新社会施展出来了，所以防疫工作有了这样伟大的成就。调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实的国际科学委员会的专家们亲眼看到中国人民现在的卫生情况，在他们的报告书中指出：“解放以来，中国所进行的卫生教育运动，其范围之广泛，也许是举世无双的。”“全体人民，不论男女老幼，都全心全意地合作。”“凡为不断和迅速提高公共卫生的一般标准所应作的事情，全都想到，而且全都做得很起劲和彻底。”“今天中国在卫生上的进步，积极实行了各种卫生的措施，这些卫生措施正是历届国际卫生机关想推动而又做不到的。”资本主义国家内的某些医学家，当中国政府揭发美帝国主义已在进行细菌战的滔天罪行时，他们认为中国境内没有重大的疫病流行，就是美帝国主义没有发动细菌战的证据。这完全由于他们漠视了中国卫生事业的飞跃进步和中国人民群众的伟大力量，所以有了这样的错误看法。帝国主义者不到失败的最后关头，是决不会悔悟的。它不但不承认它的失败事实，反屡次歪曲宣传中国卫生情况很差，胡说甚么在东北地区发现的疫病是“自然发生”的。等到国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和文幼章、法奇、约翰逊教长等发表了公正的言论，报道了细菌战的事实，美帝国主义者不能举出相反的事实来反驳，他们只好说：法律工作者、文幼章、法奇、约翰逊教长等都不是专门科学家，没有能力辨别证据的真假。现在国际科学委员会的专家，经过以客观的和最严格的科学态度进行了调查研究后，已证实了美国军队自一九五二年一月开始，确以许多不同的方法使用了细菌武器。美帝国主义者应该无可藉口了，但又恬不知耻地说：“这是一个虚构的事实。”它的用心，自然在于欺骗世界上的善良人们，来维持它的业已破产的侵略战争。
    然而作伪者心劳日拙，这种无理性的狡赖适足以暴露它的虚伪无耻的面目。它在全世界的人民面前一次再次地表示了它要毁灭和平人民的本质，这样遭到双重的失败的帝国主义者其最后的命运自必走向灭亡之路。
    为了拯救人类，为了保卫世界和平，全世界的人民应该一齐起来制裁美帝国主义者的细菌战的罪行。
