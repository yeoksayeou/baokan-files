    Old Legal Views Endanger National Economic Construction
    Cao Jie
    Protecting state property and national economic construction is one of the important tasks of the people's judicial organs. However, some staff members of the people's courts, especially those old judicial personnel who have not been thoroughly reformed, intentionally or unintentionally use the reactionary Kuomintang "Six Codes" as a basis to help illegal capitalists steal state property and undermine national economic construction.
    In handling cases involving disputes between public and private entities, they rely on the so-called "freedom of contract" of the bourgeoisie, constantly defending illegal capitalists and harming the public interest to benefit private interests. For example, the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department Electric Power Administration and the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau purchased two houses from Dong Xianghua for a total price of 2,711.8 million Northeast currency. At that time, the property rights of the houses were not fully clarified, but Dong falsely claimed that there were no problems. It was also agreed that an immediate payment of 301.45 million yuan would be made; the remaining amount would be used by Dong to purchase public bonds, which would be handed over to the Electric Power Bureau for safekeeping as collateral. Dong set a trap, stipulating in the contract that "if property rights problems arise in the future, only the public bonds can be returned." Later, it was confirmed that both houses were the property of traitors. When the Electric Power Bureau discovered the deception, it demanded that Dong return the house price. At this time, Dong, relying on the "bilateral contract" as evidence, stated that only the public bonds could be used as compensation and that he would not be liable for anything else. This case was appealed to the Northeast Branch of the Supreme People's Court, which surprisingly considered the Electric Power Bureau to be "self-inflicted" and told it to "no longer request the seller to return the house price." Dong Xianghua's illegal acts of concealing traitor property and defrauding the state of 301.45 million yuan were not investigated at all. In 1950, the Zhejiang Provincial Publicly Operated Rice Mill entrusted the privately operated Gong Da Long Rice Mill with processing. Later, because Gong Da Long misappropriated stored rice, Jiu Feng Bank was asked to guarantee that it would be returned in full within the time limit. After the deadline, 44 piculs of rice were still owed, and the publicly operated rice mill pursued compensation from Jiu Feng Bank, filing a lawsuit with the Hangzhou Municipal People's Court. However, the court ruled that "according to the literal meaning of the guarantee, it is an ordinary guarantee responsibility and should not be directly pursued from the guarantor, and the plaintiff should file a separate lawsuit against Gong Da Long." This view clearly comes from the so-called "guarantee contract" in the old law. According to this view, the guarantor can also not be held responsible when the principal fails to fulfill his obligations, resulting in the loss of state property.
    Secondly, criminal acts of private merchants stealing state property and undermining national economic construction are treated as general debt-related civil disputes. The act of offering large bribes to state personnel to steal state property is not treated as a serious violation of the law, which encourages the arrogance of illegal bourgeois elements. According to a report from the Central and Southern Branch of the Supreme People's Court in 1951, the People's Courts of Xuchang City and Yancheng County in Henan Province almost entirely treated cases of stealing state assets as debt disputes, and illegal bourgeois elements were not sentenced. The Yueyang County People's Court in Hunan Province only dealt with the compensation part of the case where the private merchant Ouyang Ling deliberately breached the contract and delayed the delivery of 6,000 railway sleepers to the Yuehan Railway Bureau, without pursuing criminal responsibility. The Northeast private merchant Wu Chunxu bribed Director Meng of the Shenyang Asbestos Factory with 100 million yuan and was reported by Director Meng. The Shenyang Municipal Court sentenced Wu to seven years in prison. When the Northeast Branch of the Supreme People's Court reviewed this case, it surprisingly considered that the private merchant Wu Chunxu's act was purely bribery, and "judging from the results of the crime, there was no damage to state property, and the harm to society was not significant," and tried its best to defend the illegal merchant in order to reduce his guilt.
    Thirdly, the "principle of legality of crime" is used to exonerate illegal bourgeois elements. Beijing's Rui Sheng Cloth Shop illegally used cloth for speculation, buying and selling on credit, and forged accounts, writing futures as spot goods. The Beijing Municipal People's Government's Commercial Bureau discovered as many as 32 bales of cotton yarn, causing great damage to the national economy. Later, the Beijing Municipal People's Court sentenced Sheng Ruizhi, the illegal owner of the cloth shop, to two years in prison and fined him 10 million yuan. Sheng filed an appeal to the Supreme People's Court. The trial personnel of the court, based on the old legal clause that "no act is a crime unless explicitly stipulated by law," considered that "the original trial's imprisonment was clearly inappropriate" and changed the punishment to a fine of 20 million yuan. Li Jiyuan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Changchun Municipal People's Court (a graduate of the puppet Manchukuo Law University and a former court judge), even openly believed that capitalists should not be punished for committing crimes. He said: "If they are punished, can they still do business?" When some capitalists evaded and underpaid taxes and were sued by the tax bureau in court, Li Jiyuan said: "If it is true, punish them for their crimes. If they are fined, can they afford it?" Some even openly defended illegal capitalists under the pretext of protecting industry and commerce. Capitalists who caused huge losses to the state through illegal means such as using inferior materials and reducing labor also believed that they should not be punished, and even economic losses should not be compensated. The reason is the so-called "the state has abundant resources, and a little loss has no major impact."
    In addition, many judicial personnel with old legal views often delay judgment, allowing state property to be damaged. For example, in the case of Zhu Shuncai, the owner of the privately operated Xie Tai Salt Shop in Hangzhou, owing salt to the Zhejiang Branch of the China Salt Industry Company, Jin Mingsheng, the court clerk (a former prosecutor), ignored more than 40 lawsuits and delayed the case for more than two years without handling it, allowing Zhu Shuncai to hide and disperse his property, causing the state to lose more than 2,000 piculs of rice.
    It can be seen from the above situation how serious the harm of the old legal views is to national economic construction! In handling cases involving public and private relations, judicial personnel with old legal views often stand on the side of illegal bourgeois elements, trying their best to defend them. They would rather have state property suffer extremely great losses than abandon those reactionary old legal clauses. In order to protect our country's large-scale economic construction in the future, we must immediately rectify our judicial organs, eliminate those reactionary and corrupt old legal views and old judicial styles, and establish the people's legal views and a revolutionary work style of serving the people.

### 旧法观点危害国家经济建设

    旧法观点危害国家经济建设
    曹杰
    保护国家财产和国家经济建设，是人民司法机关的重要任务之一。但有些人民法院的工作人员，特别是未经彻底改造的旧司法人员，却有意无意地以反动的国民党“六法”为依据，帮助不法资本家盗窃国家财产，破坏国家经济建设。
    在处理公私纠纷案件时，他们以资产阶级的所谓“契约自由”为依据，不断地替不法资本家辩护，损公利私。如东北人民政府工业部电业管理局和沈阳电业局向董祥华购入房屋两处，总价东北币二十七亿一千一百八十万元。当时房屋产权未完全弄清，但董诡称无问题。并约定即交现款三亿零一百四十五万元；其余款项由董购买公债，交电业局保管，作为担保。董设下圈套，在契约内作了“若将来产权发生问题，只能返还公债”的规定。后来证实两处房屋都是汉奸财产。电业局发现被骗，便要董返还房价。此时，董以有“双方契约”为凭，申言只能以公债作抵了事，不再负任何责任。此案上诉到最高人民法院东北分院，该分院竟认为电业局是“咎由自取”，要电业局“不得再行请求出卖人返还房价”。对董祥华隐瞒逆产及骗取国家财产三亿零一百四十五万元的犯法行为，一概不予追究。浙江省公营碾米厂于一九五○年委托私营公大隆碾米厂加工，后因公大隆挪用存米，请久丰银行作保，保证限期内如数归还。期满后还欠大米四十四石，公营碾米厂便向久丰银行追偿，起诉到杭州市人民法院。但该院却判决“按照所立保单文义是普通保证责任，不应迳向保人追偿，应由原告另向公大隆起诉”。这种见解，显然是从旧法上的所谓“保证契约”来的。根据这种见解，在本人不履行义务时，保证人也可以不负责任，结果就只有听任国家财产遭受损失了。
    其次，是把私商盗窃国家财产和破坏国家经济建设的犯罪行为，当作一般债务性质的民事纠纷来处理。对于向国家人员大量行贿以盗窃国家财产的行为，也不以严重违法论处，这就助长了不法资产阶级分子的气焰。根据一九五一年最高人民法院中南分院的报告，过去河南许昌市人民法院和郾城县人民法院，几乎把盗窃国家资财的案件全部作为债务纠纷处理，对不法资产阶级分子不予判刑。湖南省岳阳县人民法院对于私商欧阳岭故意违约拖欠粤汉路局枕木六千根一案，只单纯处理赔偿部分，不追究刑事责任。东北私商吴春绪向沈阳市石棉厂孟厂长行贿一亿元，被孟厂长检举，经沈阳市法院判处吴犯徒刑七年。最高人民法院东北分院审核这一案件时，竟认为私商吴春绪是单纯行贿行为，“就其犯罪结果来看，对国家财产并无损害，对社会的危害性亦不大”，极力替不法商人辩解，以减轻其罪责。
    再其次，是以“罪刑法定主义”来替不法资产阶级分子开脱罪责。北京市瑞盛纱布庄非法利用纱布投机，买空卖空，并伪造帐据，将期货写成现货。仅经北京市人民政府商业局查获者即有棉纱三十二件之多，使国家经济遭到很大损害。后经北京市人民法院判处该纱布庄不法老板盛瑞芝徒刑二年，罚金一千万元。盛犯上诉于最高人民法院。该院审判人员竟根据“法无明文不为罪”的旧法条文，认为“原审处以监禁，显有未当”而改处罚金二千万元了事。长春市人民法院刑庭庭长李纪元（伪满法大毕业、旧法院审判官），并公然认为资本家犯法不应该办罪。他说：“如果办罪，他们还能做买卖吗？”有些资本家偷税、漏税，由税务局起诉到法院，李纪元说：“如果属实，办他们的罪。罚他们的款，他们是否拿得起？”有的更藉口保护工商业，为违法资本家公开辩护。资本家以偷工减料等非法手段给国家造成巨大损失，也认为不应办罪，甚至连经济损失也不令赔偿。理由是所谓“国家资力雄厚，受点损失无大影响”。
    此外，还有许多具有旧法观点的司法人员时常以拖延判案的办法，坐令国家财产遭受损害。如杭州市私营协泰盐号老板朱舜才拖欠中国盐业公司浙江省分公司食盐一案，法院承办人金鸣盛（旧检察官）接到四十几次诉状都置诸不理，一直拖延了两年多还未处理，听任朱舜才把财产隐匿分散，使国家遭受二千多石米的损失。
    从上述情况可以看出：旧法观点对于国家经济建设的危害性是何等严重！具有旧法观点的司法人员在处理公私关系的案件上，常常是站在不法资产阶级分子的立场，极力为他们辩护。他们宁愿使国家财产遭受极其巨大的损失，不愿抛弃那些反动的旧法条文。为了保护我国今后大规模的经济建设，必须立即整顿我们的司法机关，肃清那些反动腐朽的旧法观点和旧司法作风，树立人民的法律观点和为人民服务的革命工作作风。
