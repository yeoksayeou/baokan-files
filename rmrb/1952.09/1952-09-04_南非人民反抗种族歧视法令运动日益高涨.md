Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: The movement of non-white people in the Union of South Africa against racial discrimination laws is escalating.

On August 26th, the judicial authorities of the Malan government opened a court in Johannesburg to try twenty people, including Cachalia, the joint secretary of the National Action Committee of the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress, who lead the non-white people of the Union of South Africa in resisting racial oppression; Kotane, a member of the Executive Committee of the African National Congress and the General Secretary of the banned South African Communist Party; Moroka, the President of the African National Congress; and Dadoo, the President of the South African Indian Congress. The Malan government charged them with violating the so-called "ban" on communism, which the authorities used to suppress all progressive elements in the country. This judicial persecution aroused the anger of the South African people. During the trial, students, citizens of Johannesburg, and representatives from other cities in the Union of South Africa formed a procession of several thousand people and held a large demonstration near the court. They held up placards with slogans such as "Down with the Apartheid Tyranny," "Release Our Leaders," and "We Want Freedom," and shouted slogans: "Down with Malan!" "Down with the law banning communism!" "Join the resistance movement!" When the persecuted South African people's leaders proudly walked through the corridors of the court, the demonstrators cheered them and sang African songs.

On the same day, non-white people in Cape Town held a demonstration in front of the police station; people in Port Elizabeth and Roodepoort also organized actions to resist racial discrimination laws. On the 25th, African workers in Cape Town went on strike and marched in the streets, defying the threats of the police with their submachine guns and clubs.

Since the formal launch of the movement against racial discrimination laws on June 26th, organized resistance actions have not ceased in various central areas throughout the Union of South Africa. The Malan government has frantically arrested non-white people participating in the resistance movement, and by August 26th, nearly three thousand people had been arrested. However, the momentum of the resistance movement has grown stronger, and many young people and women have joined the struggle.

The struggle of the non-white people of the Union of South Africa has won the sympathy of people around the world. The people of London held a mass meeting to support this struggle against racial discrimination; the World Federation of Trade Unions has protested the actions of the Malan government to the United Nations; and the Women's International Democratic Federation has also protested to the Malan government.

    南非人民反抗种族歧视法令运动日益高涨
    【新华社三日讯】南非联邦非白色人民反抗种族歧视法令的运动越来越高涨。
    八月二十六日，马兰政府司法当局在约翰内斯堡法院开庭审讯领导南非联邦非白色人民反抗种族压迫的非洲人国民大会与南非印度人大会全国行动委员会联合书记加查里亚、非洲人国民大会执行委员会委员和已被禁止的南非共产党总书记柯吞、非洲人国民大会主席莫洛卡、南非印度人大会主席达杜等二十人，马兰政府加在他们身上的罪名是破坏了当局用来压迫国内一切进步分子的所谓对共产党的“禁令”。这种司法迫害激起了南非人民的愤怒。在审讯进行期间，约翰内斯堡的学生、市民和南非联邦其他城市的代表组成好几千人的队伍，在法院附近举行大示威。他们高举写着“打倒种族隔离虐政”、“释放我们的领袖”、“我们要自由”等字样的标语牌，并且高呼口号：“打倒马兰！”“打倒禁止共产党的法律！”“参加反抗运动！”当被迫害的南非人民领袖昂然走过法院的走廊时，示威者向他们欢呼，并且高唱非洲人的歌曲。
    同一天，开普敦的非白色人民在警察局面前举行了示威；伊利莎伯港和露得普特的人民也组织了反抗种族歧视法令的行动。二十五日，开普敦的非洲工人举行了罢工，并且不顾警察们的手提机关枪和棍棒的威胁，在大街上游行。
    自从六月二十六日反抗种族歧视法令的运动正式开展以来，南非联邦全国各中心地区就一直没有停止过有组织的反抗行动。马兰政府疯狂逮捕参加反抗运动的非白色人民，到八月二十六日为止，被捕的已经差不多有三千人。但是，反抗运动的声势却越来越浩大，许多青年和妇女都参加了斗争。
    南非联邦非白色人民的斗争获得了世界各国人民的同情。伦敦人民举行了一个群众大会，声援这种反抗种族歧视的斗争；世界工会联合会已经向联合国抗议马兰政府的行径；国际民主妇女联合会也向马兰政府提出了抗议。
