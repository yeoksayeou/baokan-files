Chinese youth are jubilantly celebrating National Day, hailing the series of great victories our motherland has achieved in the past three years, rejoicing in the preliminary happy life we have attained, reviewing our strength to welcome the new era of the motherland's great construction and our own better future, and actively participating in the great cause of defending world peace.

Our leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese Communist Party, applying the creative theories of Marxism-Leninism, led the people of all ethnic groups in our country to liberate the mainland of China, expel the imperialist forces, suppress bandits, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, achieving an unprecedentedly genuine unity and complete independence of our country. We have strengthened our national defense, thwarted the ambitious plans of US imperialism to invade Korea and encroach on our country, and effectively defended peace in the Far East and the world. We have basically completed land reform, victoriously carried out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, comprehensively restored and developed industrial and agricultural production, as well as cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and achieved a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation. It is precisely because our motherland has achieved this series of great victories under the leadership of Chairman Mao that Chinese youth now have a bright future for study and work. Tens of millions of young farmers are happily working on their own land. Young workers are creating wealth for the motherland and continuously improving their material and cultural life. In the second half of this year, 52.3 million young people and children across the country entered schools at all levels, more than double the highest number in the old China. All students in secondary technical schools, normal schools, and universities enjoy preferential state and people's scholarships. Now our national administrative organs, economic departments, and cultural and educational departments have absorbed millions of young people to work, and they can fully and freely develop their personal talents according to the needs of the country.

Chinese youth are taught by Mao Zedong. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese youth are carrying forward the heroic and active spirit of internationalism and patriotism, loyal to the motherland and the people, and have been standing at the forefront of the struggle on all fronts for the past three years. In the unprecedentedly magnificent movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, millions of young people have requested to join the Chinese People's Volunteers. The youth in the Chinese People's Volunteers, under the call of "rendering meritorious service for the people of the motherland" and "avenging the people of Korea," are vying to carry out killing-the-enemy competitions. The youth in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the command of their superiors and together with all the soldiers, after liberating the mainland of China and suppressing the bandits, are vigilantly defending the coast and borders of the motherland and actively learning cultural and modern military science and technology. More than half of the national militia are young people. They actively maintain local security and use their spare time to study military affairs, ready to contribute their strength to defend the motherland at any time. In the land reform, 70 percent of the rural youth actively participated in this great movement of emancipation. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the vast number of young people always took the initiative to act, standing guard, investigating and reporting, and resolutely fighting against the enemy. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, the vast number of young people demonstrated a high degree of political enthusiasm and enthusiastically participated in propaganda and reporting work. Taking Shanghai as an example, in the "Five-Anti" movement, young people reported more than 100,000 facts of illegal capitalists' "five poisons." In industrial and mining enterprises, young workers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government, actively participated in the patriotic production increase and economy movement, worked hard to learn culture and technology, and promoted and created advanced production experience. Taking Shenyang as an example, in May of this year, employees in the city put forward a total of 34,000 rationalization proposals, of which young workers accounted for 1,900. Taking Tianjin as an example, from June to the end of August this year, employees in the city put forward a total of 16,269 rationalization proposals, of which young workers accounted for 6,544. Taking the medium-sized city of Zhangjiakou as an example, since the launch of the patriotic production increase and economy movement in June this year, the production efficiency of young workers has generally increased to four times. In agricultural production, the vast number of young farmers are active participants in patriotic bumper harvest competitions and mutual aid and cooperation. Taking Heilongjiang Province as an example, 90 percent of the young members of the Communist Youth League in rural areas have joined agricultural mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives. Taking Zuoquan County in Shanxi as an example, there are 776 CYL members and young people serving as heads of mutual aid teams, accounting for 32 percent of the total number of mutual aid team leaders in the county, and 137 CYL members were elected as model team leaders. In the great Huai River harnessing project, more than 2 million young people participated in this glorious labor force.

In the above series of struggles, noble examples of infinite loyalty to the great motherland have emerged among Chinese youth. Such as the great internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save a Korean boy, and Ding Youjun, a loyal daughter of the motherland who was unyielding in the face of the enemy and died heroically. They and other martyrs bravely and outstandingly created moving heroic deeds. They live in the hearts of the people and forever encourage Chinese youth to forge ahead courageously.

In the above series of struggles, tens of thousands of patriotic heroes and labor models have also emerged among Chinese youth. Nationally famous are Zhang Jihui, the hero who shot down the plane of the American aggressor Davis, who called himself the "King of the Air"; Cai Jinyong, the brave warrior who fought with his stomach wrapped after being seriously injured and killed fourteen American bandits before crawling back to his position; Huang Xinliang, the daring hero who single-handedly captured more than 280 bandits; Hao Jianxiu, the female worker who created a new fine yarn working method; Zheng Xikun, the creator of the railway "over-axle, 500-kilometer operation method"; Jin Xiulan, the Huai River harnessing hero who created a method of digging thin sludge and saved 700,020 workdays of civilian labor; Cui Yuxia, the leader of the national wheat bumper harvest model group; Qi Jianhua, the creator of the rapid literacy method; Shi Ruifen, the model primary school teacher; and Gao Yubao, the author who became the author of a 200,000-300,000 word novel through self-study from illiteracy. Chinese youth are proud of these heroes and models. However, no hero or model should have any pride or complacency. They should understand that their creative ability can only be developed and expanded under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and under the nurturing of the masses of the people. Therefore, they must firmly remember Chairman Mao's instruction to avoid pride at all times, learn humbly, and continue to advance.

The Chinese New Democratic Youth League, which has been diligently cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party, has faithfully assisted its leader, the Chinese Communist Party, in the difficult, intense, and great three years, and with its hard work and its model actions, united and guided the vast number of young people to participate in the various great struggles of the motherland. Through these great struggles and the education of the Party, the influence of the Youth League has become increasingly widespread, and the organization has become increasingly strong. It now has 6.3 million members and leads more than 5 million Young Pioneers. As the reserve force of the Party, its role has become increasingly significant. Since the founding of the League in 1949, hundreds of thousands of outstanding League members have gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

As we celebrate the third National Day, we, together with the people of the whole country, excitedly and enthusiastically welcome the upcoming climax of economic construction and cultural construction under the leadership of our beloved leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. However, the warmongers headed by the American imperialists are the destroyers of peaceful construction, and they are determined to be enemies of the people of Asia and the people of the world. The US imperialists are delaying the Korean peace talks, trying their best to support the forces of Japanese militarism, establishing many military bases in the Pacific, and desperately carrying out war instigation. Under this situation, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is being held in our capital, showing its great significance and glorious responsibility. It is precisely because of this that we Chinese youth extend our respect to every international peace fighter who is fighting for peace with extremely warm feelings, and wish the conference a brilliant success.

In order to build a great motherland, we must study hard and stand at the forefront of the struggle. In order to defend peace, we must closely unite and fight together with the youth and all people who love peace in Asia and the world. Chinese youth will shoulder the responsibility of building the motherland and defending peace, and advance forever under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong.

    中国青年为建设祖国与保卫和平而奋斗
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记  胡耀邦
    全国青年，欢欣鼓舞庆祝国庆，欢呼祖国三年来一系列的伟大胜利，欢呼已经得到了的初步幸福生活，并检阅自己的力量，迎接祖国伟大建设的新时期和自己更美好的将来，积极参加保卫世界和平的伟大事业。
    我们的领袖毛泽东主席和中国共产党，应用创造性的马克思列宁主义的学说，领导着我国各族人民，解放了全国大陆，驱逐了帝国主义势力，剿灭了土匪，镇压了反革命，实现了我国空前的真正统一和完全独立。我们加强了国防，挫败了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和侵犯我国的狂妄计划，有效地保卫了远东和世界的和平。我们基本上完成了土地改革，胜利地进行了“三反”“五反”运动，全面地恢复和发展了工农业生产和文化教育及卫生事业，取得了财政经济状况的根本好转。正因为我们祖国在毛主席的领导下获得这一系列的伟大胜利，中国青年从此有了学习和工作的美好前途。数千万的青年农民，在自己的土地上愉快地劳动着。青年工人为祖国创造着财富，并不断地改进自己的物质文化生活。今年下半年，全国有五千二百三十万青年和少年进入各级学校，比旧中国的最高年份多了一倍多。中等技术学校、师范学校和高等学校全部学生享受着国家人民助学金的优待。现在我们国家的行政机关和经济部门及文化教育部门，吸收了数百万青年做工作，他们可以按照国家的需要，充分地自由地发展个人的才能。
    中国青年是毛泽东教导出来的。中国青年在中国共产党的领导下，发扬着忠于祖国和忠于人民的国际主义、爱国主义的英勇积极精神，三年来，站在各个战线上的斗争的前列。在全国人民空前雄伟的抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，青年要求报名参加中国人民志愿军的，为数达几百万。中国人民志愿军中的青年，在“为祖国人民立功”，“替朝鲜人民报仇”的号召下，争先恐后，实行杀敌竞赛。中国人民解放军中的青年，在上级指挥下，和全体战士一道，在解放了中国大陆和剿灭了土匪之后，警惕地捍卫着祖国的海岸和边疆，积极地学习文化和近代化军事科学技术。在全国民兵里，有一半以上是青年，他们既积极地维护着地方治安，又利用生产空隙学习军事，随时准备着为捍卫祖国而贡献自己的力量。在土地改革中，农村百分之七十的青年，积极地参加了这个伟大的翻身运动。在镇压反革命运动中，广大青年总是首先行动起来，站岗放哨，调查检举，无情地坚决地与敌人作斗争。在“三反”和“五反”斗争中，广大青年发挥了高度的政治积极性，热忱地参加了宣传鼓动和检举工作；以上海市为例，青年在“五反”中，就检举了违法资本家十余万件“五毒”的事实。在工矿企业中，青年工人热烈地响应党和政府的号召，积极参加了爱国增产节约运动，努力学习文化和技术，推广和创造先进生产经验；以沈阳市为例，今年五月全市职工共提合理化建议三万四千件，青年工人占了一千九百件；又以天津市为例，今年六月至八月底全市职工共提合理化建议一万六千二百六十九件，青年工人占六千五百四十四件；再以中等城市张家口为例，从今年六月开展爱国增产节约运动以来，青年工人的生产效率一般的提高到四倍。在农业生产中，广大青年农民是爱国丰产竞赛和互助合作的积极参加者；以黑龙江省为例，农村中百分之九十的青年团员参加了农业互助组或农业生产合作社；再以山西左权县为例，团员和青年当互助组长的有七百七十六人，占全县互助组长百分之三十二，而团员当选为模范组长的又有一百三十七人。在伟大的治淮工程中，有二百多万青年参加了这个光荣的劳动行列。
    在上述一系列的斗争中，中国青年中出现了无限忠诚于伟大祖国的崇高典范。如舍身拯救朝鲜少年的伟大国际主义战士罗盛教，如在敌人面前坚强不屈、壮烈牺牲的祖国忠贞女儿丁佑君，他们和其他烈士忠勇卓绝地创造了可歌可泣的英雄事迹，他们活在人民的心中，永远地鼓舞着中国青年奋勇向前。
    在上述一系列的斗争中，中国青年中还涌现出了成千累万的爱国英雄和劳动模范。著名全国的，有击落美国侵略者自称为“空中大王”戴维斯所驾飞机的英雄张积慧；有身负重伤后仍裹腹奋战杀死十四个美国强盗才爬回阵地的蔡金勇士；有只身生擒土匪二百八十多名的独胆英雄黄新良；有创造新的细纱工作法的女工郝建秀；有铁路“超轴、五百公里作业法”创造者郑锡坤；有创造挖稀淤泥方法节省民工七十万零两千个工作日的治淮英雄金秀兰；有全国小麦丰产模范小组组长崔玉霞；有速成识字法的创造者祁建华；有模范小学教师史瑞芬；有由文盲自学而成为二、三十万字小说的作者高玉宝。中国青年以这些英雄模范而感到光荣。不过，任何一个英雄模范，都不应有丝毫的骄傲和自满，他们应该懂得：他们的创造能力，只有在中国共产党领导下和在人民大众的培育下，才能发挥和发展起来，因而他们必须牢牢地记住毛主席关于任何时候都要避免骄傲的指示，虚心学习，不断地前进。
    为中国共产党所尽心培育出来的中国新民主主义青年团，在艰难、紧张而伟大的三年中，忠心耿耿地协助着自己的领导者——中国共产党，以辛勤的工作和自己的模范行动，团结和引导着广大青年参加了祖国的各种伟大的斗争。经过这些伟大的斗争和党的教育，青年团的影响日益深广，组织日益壮大，现在已拥有六百三十万团员，并领导着五百多万少年儿童队员。作为党的后备军，它的作用日益显著，从一九四九年建团到现在，已有数十万的优秀团员，光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    当欢庆第三届国庆节的时候，我们和全国人民一起，兴奋鼓舞地在心爱的领袖毛主席和中国共产党领导下，迎接即将到来的经济建设和文化建设的高潮。但是，以美国帝国主义者为首的战争贩子，是和平建设的破坏者，他们决心和亚洲人民、世界人民为敌。美帝国主义者拖延朝鲜和平谈判，竭力扶植日本军国主义势力，在太平洋上建立许多军事基地，拚命进行战争的煽动。在这个形势下，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我国首都召开，显示出她的伟大意义和光荣责任。也正因为如此，我们中国青年以极其热烈的心情，向大会每个为和平而奋斗的国际和平志士致敬，并祝大会获得光辉的成就。
    为了建设伟大的祖国，我们一定要努力学习，站在斗争的前列。为了保卫和平，我们一定和亚洲及全世界爱好和平的青年与一切人们亲密地团结，共同奋斗。中国青年将肩负起建设祖国和保卫和平的责任，在毛泽东的胜利旗帜下，永远前进。
