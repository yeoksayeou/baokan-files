    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: The Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly and the National Committee of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front, in celebration of the seventh anniversary of the Vietnamese "August Revolution" and the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, jointly issued a letter to the Vietnamese people. The letter first mourns the heroes who sacrificed themselves for the motherland and extends sincere condolences and congratulations to disabled soldiers and the sick, families of martyrs, and the people of the whole country and overseas Vietnamese.
    The letter then points out that over the past seven years, the Vietnamese army and people "have defeated the enemy in many major battles, and guerrilla warfare has flourished everywhere. The enemy has suffered heavy losses. They are now in a dangerous situation of panic and passive beatings." The letter then describes the achievements of the Vietnamese people in economic, cultural, and social construction in wartime, and says: The great unity of the entire Vietnamese people has been increasingly consolidated and developed. ...The enhancement of unity between religions and between ethnic groups has completely bankrupted the enemy's conspiracies to sow discord."
    The letter calls on the Vietnamese people to learn from the example of the Soviet Red Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the valuable experience and heroic fighting spirit of the Vietnamese "August Revolution" fighters, and strive to complete the four tasks formulated by President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Government, and the Vietnam Lien Viet Front.
    The letter concludes by pointing out that under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Lao Dong Party, and with the sympathy and support of the Soviet Union, China, various people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people all over the world, the Vietnamese people will surely defeat the French colonialists and the US imperialist interventionists and their running dog traitorous Vietnamese, win national independence, freedom, and happiness, and make even greater contributions to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

    【新华社一日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南国民大会常务委员会和越南国民联合战线全国委员会，为庆祝越南“八月革命”和越南民主共和国成立七周年，联合发表告越南人民书。告人民书首先悼念为祖国牺牲的英雄，并向残废军人及病员、烈士家属和全国人民及海外越侨致亲切的慰问和祝贺。
    告人民书接着指出，越南军民七年来“在许多次的大战役中战胜了敌人，游击战已到处蓬勃展开。敌人已蒙受惨重的损失。他们现正处于慌乱、被动挨打的危险境地。”告人民书继即叙述越南人民在战争情况下在经济、文化、社会建设等方面所赢得的成绩，并说：越南“全民的大团结已日益巩固和发展。……宗教间与民族间团结的增强，使敌人挑拨离间的阴谋完全破产”。
    告人民书号召越南人民学习苏联红军和中国人民解放军的榜样和越南“八月革命”战士的宝贵经验和英勇战斗的精神，努力完成胡志明主席、越南人民政府和越南国民联合战线所制订的四项任务。
    告人民书最后指出：越南人民在胡志明主席和劳动党的英明领导下，在苏联、中国、各人民民主国家和全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支持下，一定会战胜法殖民主义者和美帝国主义干涉者及其走狗叛国越奸，赢得民族的独立、自由和幸福，并进而在保卫亚洲和世界的和平事业中作出更多的贡献。
