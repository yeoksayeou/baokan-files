Xinhua News Agency, September 12th, San José dispatch: The broad masses of the Costa Rican people recently achieved victory in their struggle against the government's persecution of peace fighter Eduardo Mora.

Mora was unreasonably arrested by the Costa Rican government upon his return home after attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The film he brought back regarding the bacteriological warfare conducted by American imperialism, the recordings of confessions of American prisoners of war who participated in bacteriological warfare, and some books and publications on defending peace were also confiscated. The Costa Rican government falsely accused Mora, who was engaged in the peace movement, of "treason."

After news spread that the bacteriological warfare film was secretly screened at the Presidential Palace, the broad masses immediately demanded the public screening of the film in order to understand the truth about the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare. This incident caused a sensation throughout the country, and newspapers continued to devote the front page to these news items for eight days. Those newspapers that had engaged in smear campaigns against Mora were forced to admit that Mora had brought back evidence of U.S. bacteriological warfare. In order to enable the people to understand the truth, the Costa Rican Peace Committee widely distributed pamphlets about the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare. This pamphlet was very popular and well-received.

The Costa Rican government's persecution of Mora aroused anger and protests from the broad masses of the people. The fact that the U.S. Embassy attempted to summon Costa Rican judges to "discuss the Mora case" further exposed the conspiracy of the United States to infringe upon Costa Rica's independent sovereignty and attempt to stifle the Costa Rican peace movement. People from all walks of life in Costa Rica expressed their support for Mora. As a result, due to mass pressure and the lack of evidence for accusations, the Costa Rican government had no choice but to release Mora.

Currently, Mora is continuing to widely promote the important significance of convening the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    哥斯达黎加人民营救和平战士莫拉获胜
    【新华社十二日讯】圣约瑟迟到消息：哥斯达黎加广大人民最近在反对政府迫害和平战士艾杜亚多·莫拉的斗争中获得了胜利。
    莫拉在参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议回国后，即遭到哥斯达黎加政府的无理逮捕。他所带回国的关于美帝国主义进行细菌战的影片、参加细菌战的美国俘虏供词的录音以及一些关于保卫和平的书刊，也都被没收。哥斯达黎加政府给从事和平运动的莫拉加上了莫须有的“叛国罪”的罪名。
    当细菌战影片在总统府秘密放映的消息传出后，广大群众立即要求公映这部影片，以便了解美军进行细菌战的真相。这件事轰动了全国，各报继续八天用第一版篇幅刊载这些新闻。那些对莫拉进行污蔑宣传的报纸，都不得不承认莫拉带回了美国进行细菌战的证据。哥斯达黎加和平委员会为使人民了解真相，即广泛散发关于美军进行细菌战的小册子，这本小册子非常流行，很受欢迎。
    哥斯达黎加政府迫害莫拉的行动，激起了广大人民的愤怒和抗议。美国大使馆企图召见哥斯达黎加法官“商讨莫拉案件”，这一事实进一步暴露了美国侵犯哥斯达黎加独立主权、企图扼杀哥斯达黎加和平运动的阴谋。哥斯达黎加各阶层人民纷纷表示支持莫拉。结果，由于群众的压力和找不出控告的证据，哥斯达黎加政府只好释放了莫拉。
    现在，莫拉正继续广泛宣传召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重要意义。
