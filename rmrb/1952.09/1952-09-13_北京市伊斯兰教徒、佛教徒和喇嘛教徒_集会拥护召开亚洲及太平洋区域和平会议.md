(New China News Agency report) Beijing's Muslims, Buddhists, and Lamaists recently held meetings to support the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing.

    On the afternoon of August 8, more than sixty Ahongs (imams) from mosques in Beijing gathered to discuss the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing. All speakers unanimously expressed their support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference being held in our capital, Beijing, and enthusiastically wished the conference success. In the end, the 67 Ahong representatives present issued a joint written statement on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the capital who believe in Islam. The statement said: We, the people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam, have long suffered from discrimination and persecution by reactionary forces, which has caused us to lag behind in politics, economics, and culture. The establishment of New China has given us a new life, and Chairman Mao has brought us infinite light and happiness. The People's Government correctly implements ethnic policies, cultivating a large number of Hui cadres to participate in the work of various departments, helping us develop the economy, improve our lives, and helping establish 27 primary schools in Beijing so that Hui children can receive education. Our living habits and religious beliefs are all taken care of and respected. The statement also said: Peace is the lifeline of our people, and we need peace. All good people are in urgent need of peace. We oppose aggression; aggression is our mortal enemy. We hope for the successful convening of the peace conference, and we are willing to dedicate all our strength to peace, and work with the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and the world to fight for lasting peace for mankind.

    On the 9th, three hundred and forty-seven Buddhist monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists in Beijing held a conference. Each person who participated in the conference spoke about their opinions in support of convening the peace conference. Dharma Master Daru of Jile Temple said: Peace is the duty of us Buddhists, and we are willing to work hard to achieve peace; but under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this goal could never be achieved. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and established the People's Republic of China, beginning to live a peaceful and happy life. We in the Buddhist community of Beijing warmly welcome the upcoming peace conference in Beijing, and we will do our best to fight for world peace. Tao Ranting Yian, an old monk and representative to the Fourth Beijing Municipal People's Congress, said: "Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, we Buddhists not only have complete freedom of belief, but also have the right to ask about national affairs, which has never happened before. We wholeheartedly support the convening of the peace conference in Beijing; we Buddhists must unite even more closely and work hard to defend peace in Asia and the world." Dharma Master Huixiu of Daci Temple said: "We warmly support the upcoming peace conference in Beijing; we do not want war. Under the leadership of the People's Government, we Buddhists have had our own cultural and production undertakings for the past three years, and have begun to live a peaceful and happy life. We will not allow American imperialism to destroy our peaceful life, and we must strive to achieve world peace!" At the end of the conference, amidst warm applause, a written statement welcoming the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was passed. After the meeting, all participants signed their names on it. They also expressed satisfaction that Yuan Ying would represent the Chinese Buddhist community at the peace conference.

    On the afternoon of the 7th, more than 200 lamas from 32 Lama temples in Beijing gathered in the Tibetan Scripture Hall of Yonghe Temple to express their support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. At the suggestion of Ishgaqwa, the great lama of Yonghe Temple, Bogderlegell, the great lama of Songzhu Temple, Sodanamuzhashi, the great lama of Xinsi Temple, and Cheba, the great lama of Jingzhu Temple, the meeting unanimously decided to issue a written statement expressing support for the convening of the peace conference. Lamas of all ethnic groups who attended the meeting signed the statement in Tibetan, Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese. The statement said: We are Mongolian and Tibetan people who believe in Lamaism. In the past, under the oppression and ravages of imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, we lived a miserable life. They forcibly occupied our temples, destroyed our Buddha statues, and burned our scriptures. We, like people of all ethnic groups who believe in other religions, had no freedom. But the strong and unyielding Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao, carried out continuous struggles and finally drove them away and established their own country. We must not allow the peaceful and happy days that we have exchanged for through untold hardships to be destroyed. We are willing to do everything in our power to fight for peace to the end.

    北京市伊斯兰教徒、佛教徒和喇嘛教徒
    集会拥护召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议 【本报讯】据新华社讯：北京市的伊斯兰教徒、佛教徒和喇嘛教徒最近曾分别举行会议，拥护即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    北京市六十多座清真寺的阿訇八日下午集会讨论即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的问题。所有发言的人都一致表示拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我国首都北京召开，并热忱地预祝会议的成功。最后，到会的六十七位阿訇代表首都信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民联名发表了一项书面声明。声明说：我们信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，过去长期受着反动势力的歧视与迫害，因此造成我们在政治、经济和文化各方面的落后。新中国的建立使我们得到了新生，毛主席给我们带来无限光明和幸福。人民政府正确地执行民族政策，培养了大批回民干部，参加各部门的工作，帮助我们发展经济，改善了我们的生活，帮助在北京设立二十七个小学，使回民子女都能受到教育。我们的生活习惯、宗教信仰都得到照顾和尊重。声明又说：和平是我们人民的生命线，我们需要和平。一切善良的人民，都迫切需要和平。我们反对侵略，侵略是我们的死敌。我们希望和平会议的胜利召开，我们愿为和平献出一切力量，与亚洲及太平洋区域以及全世界人民一道，为人类的持久和平而奋斗。
    北京市佛教的僧尼、居士等三百四十七人，在九日举行大会。每个参加大会的人发言时，说出了自己拥护召开和平会议的意见。极乐庵达如法师说：和平是我们佛教徒的本分，我们愿意为实现和平而努力；但在国民党反动统治下，始终无法达到这一目的。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，中国人民推翻了国民党反动统治，建立了中华人民共和国，开始过着和平幸福生活。我们北京市佛教界热烈欢迎即将在北京召开的和平会议，我们要尽力为世界和平事业而奋斗。北京市第四届人民代表会议代表陶然亭义安老和尚说：“在中央人民政府领导下，我们佛教徒不但得到信仰的完全自由，而且有权利过问国家大事，这是以前从来没有的事。我们衷心拥护在北京召开和平会议；我们佛教界要更加团结起来，为保卫亚洲及世界和平而努力。”大慈庵慧修法师说：“我们热烈拥护即将在北京召开的和平会议；我们不希望战争。在人民政府领导下，三年来我们佛教徒有了自己的文化事业和生产事业，开始过着和平幸福的生活，我们不让美帝国主义来破坏我们的和平生活，我们一定要为实现世界和平而奋斗！”大会最后在热烈的掌声中，通过了欢迎召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的书面声明。会后，参加会议的人都在上面签了名。他们并对圆瑛将代表中国佛教界参加和平会议表示满意。
    北京市三十二座喇嘛庙的二百多位喇嘛，曾于七日下午在雍和宫藏经馆集会，表示拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。在雍和宫大喇嘛依什噶瓦、嵩祝寺大喇嘛博客得勒格尔、新寺大喇嘛索达那木札什、净住寺大喇嘛策巴等的倡议下，会议一致决定发表书面声明，表示拥护和平会议的召开。到会的各族喇嘛并分别以藏、蒙、满、汉等文字在声明上签名。声明说：我们是信仰喇嘛教的蒙、藏族人民。过去，我们在帝国主义与国内反动势力的压迫、蹂躏之下，过着悲惨的日子。他们强占我们的寺庙，破坏我们的佛像，焚毁我们的经卷，我们和信仰其他宗教的各族人民一样地没有自由。但坚强不屈的中国人民，在中国共产党和英明领袖毛主席的领导下，进行不断的斗争，终于赶走了他们，而建立起自己的国家。我们经过千辛万苦换来的和平幸福的日子，决不能让它遭受破坏。我们愿尽一切力量为争取和平奋斗到底。
