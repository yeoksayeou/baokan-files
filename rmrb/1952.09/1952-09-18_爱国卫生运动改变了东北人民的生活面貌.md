The Patriotic Health Campaign that began in Northeast China in March of this year is unprecedented in history, both in terms of its scale and its effects. This movement has brought a new look to many cities and villages, and many tremendous reforms that change customs and habits have emerged.

The Patriotic Health Campaign has solved many environmental sanitation problems in cities that have not been solved for many years. People call this a "historical miracle." In Shenyang, the capital of Northeast China, eight large garbage dumps with a history of one or two decades were cleared this year. Many places in the city that used to have mountains of garbage have now become places for citizens to rest and entertain themselves, or small parks. In Dalian, more than 19 sewage ditches with a total length of more than 45,000 meters have been dredged. The citizens of Shanhaiguan filled in more than 8,600 square meters of sewage ditches or sewage pits left over from the construction of the Great Wall by feudal emperors of the past, and hauled more than 1,600 carts and more than 1,400 tons of yellow sand and soil to level all the rugged streets and squares in the city. In Jinzhou, there was a place formerly called "Shitty Alley." In the past, people passing by had to cover their noses with one hand and drive away flies with the other. This year, because residents have installed lids on all toilets, built more than 20 dirty water wells and trash cans, and banned children from defecating anywhere, the name "Shitty Alley" has been gradually forgotten. The workers' residential area of ​​Haizhou Mining Area in Fuxin City used to be called "Garbage Community." This year, more than 200 of the 370 households in this "community" have been rated as model households of first-class hygiene.

The scenes in many rural areas have also been completely renewed. Most of the toilets and livestock pens closer to the residences have been moved, the courtyards full of garbage have been cleaned up, the free-flying and running poultry and livestock have been enclosed, many dirty wells have been repaired and wooden lids have been installed, and many households have hung gauze curtains on their windows. In Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, which is famous for its hygiene, most farmers have whitewashed their walls with lime or yellow mud, and almost all the toilets in the urban area have eliminated flies and maggots. In all the rural areas under the jurisdiction of Dalian City, the farmers specifically stipulated ten measures such as sweeping, brushing, wiping, washing, drying, padding, enclosing, covering, moving, and reforming, so that rural hygiene was done very thoroughly. In Anguang County, Heilongjiang Province, more than 90% of residents' homes have no cracks in the walls and no pits in the yards. Bedbugs, mosquitoes, and mice can no longer find a place to live.

Due to the development of the Patriotic Health Campaign, the superstitious ideas and dirty habits created by the old society have been gradually replaced by the new atmosphere of "everyone talks about hygiene and every family loves cleanliness." In the past, in cities and villages, most residents always observed the old custom of "dusting" at the end of the year (December 23rd of the lunar calendar); now, in many cities and villages, a small sweep every day and a big sweep every week has become a way of life for every household. Frequent bathing and changing clothes have also become a major part of farmers' hygienic life. Farmers in Guojiafang Village in the suburbs of Dalian City specially set up a "simple bathhouse" this year. All villagers can take a bath once a week. Now, even old ladies who used to dislike bathing feel uncomfortable if they don't take a bath for a week. Farmers in the four villages of Minzhong, Gongnong, etc. in the tenth district of Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province, have generally become accustomed to wiping their bodies once a day and washing their feet before going to bed at night. The habit of drinking cold water that was prevalent in rural areas in the past has also gradually been eliminated. For example, many farmers' homes in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, have thermos bottles, which have been rare in rural areas for many years; farmers in Guojiafang Village in the suburbs of Dalian City now carry a pot of cold boiled water with them when they go to the fields or mountains. Good hygienic habits have been further consolidated and maintained through the establishment of the "People's Hygiene Day" system. In Lushun, a slogan is popular among citizens on People's Hygiene Day: "Clean in the morning, bathe at noon, and review in the evening," which has become a new way of life that they consciously abide by.

The enthusiasm and creativity of the people in the Patriotic Health Campaign have been greatly developed. They have thought of many ways to maintain good hygienic habits. Shenyang City has established nearly 4,000 vegetable disinfection stations in many residential groups to prevent infection of various infectious bacteria from vegetables. The residents of Nansanjing Road in the Nan District said, "Now eating vegetables that have not been disinfected is as uneasy as eating flies!" Farmers in Ximaojun Village in the suburbs of Shenyang City set up a steam delousing station. The first time villagers sent clothes to the delousing station to be steamed, there were 67 pieces, and the third time it increased to more than 1,100 pieces. People exclaimed, "We haven't been able to get rid of lice for so many years! The country has really changed, and everything has changed!"

In the Patriotic Health Campaign, people in various places created many exquisite "hygienic weapons" of various shapes. In terms of catching insects: there are various shapes of insect-catching sticky nets, open-mouthed insect-catching nets, close-hand insect-catching pats, insect-catching lampshades, insect-catching lanterns, etc.; in terms of catching rats: there are "rat-piercing arrows" made of rubber bands and iron nails, "rat-hanging racks" made of horsehair and bamboo branches, iron wire cages that can only enter but not exit called "rat maze," various rat-catching boxes made of movable flaps, and various rat-catching devices called "thousand-jin gates" and "double-ended blockades." It is precisely because of the effective use of these tools that the work of catching rats and insects this year has achieved unprecedented results. The entire region caught more than 10,367,800 rats in March and April. Shenyang City alone destroyed more than 3,400 kilograms of flies and various insects in twenty days in May.

The benefits of the Patriotic Health Campaign have been personally experienced by thousands of people. Although the enemy launched a heinous bacteriological war, the epidemic this year was greatly reduced compared to previous years. In Shenyang City, from March to May this year, the number of patients with typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever was only 14.8% of the same period last year, and the number of patients with dysentery was only 1.3% of the same period last year. The number of patients in Jinzhou City from January to June this year decreased by more than 73% compared with the same period last year. In rural areas, the trend of reduced disease is also very significant. In Yujialing Village, Xiuwen County, Liaodong Province, there is a popular saying: "Hygiene is a treasure for treating diseases, and it can be cured without spending money!" In Zhangjiabaozi and Hujiabaozi in this village, many people got sick in previous years. This year, local farmers mobilized to fill in the fifteen stinky water pits around these two neighborhoods and thoroughly cleaned the inside and outside of the houses, and the number of people who got sick was much less.

The Patriotic Health Campaign led by the People's Government has won unanimous praise from people in cities and villages. A 70-year-old woman in Dongmenwai Village, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, said, "It is so comfortable to clean up inside and outside the house, and I can live a few more years!" The women in Laohumiao Street, Dadong District, Shenyang City, said, "In previous years, flies were flying all over the house in April, and the children cried because the flies were biting them while they were sleeping during the day. Now there are no flies, and the children sleep peacefully."

Young people can grow up healthily, and old people can prolong their lives. This is the most pleasant and happiest thing that the people of Northeast China generally feel in this year's Patriotic Health Campaign. The bacteriological war painstakingly carried out by the American aggressors has been and will continue to be completely defeated in the face of the powerful patriotic health front of the people of Northeast China.

    爱国卫生运动改变了东北人民的生活面貌
    新华社记者  方言
    东北地区从今年三月开始的爱国卫生运动，不论从它的规模或效果来说，都是历史上空前未有的。这一运动给许多城市和乡村带来了新的面貌，出现了许多移风易俗的巨大改革。
    爱国卫生运动解决了许多城市多年未解决的环境卫生问题。人们把这叫做“历史的奇迹”。东北区首府沈阳市，今年曾清除了八处有一、二十年历史的大垃圾堆，市内原来有很多垃圾成山的地方，如今都变成了供市民休息、娱乐的场所或小型公园。在旅大市，也有长达四万五千多公尺的十九条污水沟被疏通了。山海关的市民填平了历代封建帝王修筑长城时遗留下来的八千六百多平方公尺的污水沟或污水坑，并拉了一千六百多车和一千四百多吨的黄砂土，铺平了全市所有地面坎坷的街道和广场。在锦州市，有一个原来叫做“稀屎胡同”的地方，从前过路的人都要一手掩住鼻子，一手驱赶苍蝇；今年，由于居民们在所有厕所上安了盖，修建了二十多个脏水井和垃圾箱，并且禁止了孩子们随地便溺，这个“稀屎胡同”的名字已被人们逐渐遗忘了。阜新市海州矿区的工人住宅区，过去被人称为“垃圾社宅”，今年这个“社宅”的三百七十户人家中，有二百多家被评为甲等卫生模范户。
    很多农村里的景象也是焕然一新。距离住宅较近的厕所和畜圈大部分迁移了，堆满垃圾的院落被清理干净了，乱飞乱跑的家禽家畜被关圈起来了，许多肮脏的水井经过修理，安上了木盖，许多人家的窗户挂起了纱帘。以卫生著名的辽东省宽甸县，绝大部分农户用石灰或黄泥刷了墙，城关区的厕所几乎全部消灭了苍蝇和蛆。在旅大市所辖的全县农村中，农民们具体地规定扫、刷、抹、洗、晒、垫、圈、盖、迁、改等十项办法，使农村卫生做得非常彻底。在黑龙江省的安广县，有百分之九十以上的居民的家中，做到了墙没缝，院没坑。臭虫，蚊子，老鼠从此找不到它们的栖身之所。
    由于爱国卫生运动的开展，旧社会所造成的迷信思想和肮脏习惯，已逐渐被“人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁”的新风气所代替了。往年，在城市和农村中，绝大部分居民一向遵守着年末（阴历腊月二十三）“扫尘”的老规矩；现在，在很多城市和农村中，一天一小扫，一周一大扫，已成为家家户户的生活规则。勤洗澡和勤换衣也成了农民卫生生活中一项主要的内容。旅大市郊郭家坊村的农民今年特别设立了一座“简便澡塘”，全村人民每星期都可以洗一次澡，现在，连一向不爱洗澡的老太太一星期不洗也觉得难受。黑龙江省甘南县十区民众、工农等四个村的农民，已普遍习惯了每天擦一次身，晚上临睡前洗一次脚。往年在农村中盛行的喝冷水的习惯也逐渐消除，例如，辽东省宽甸县很多农民家中，已出现了在农村中多年罕见的暖水瓶；旅大市郊郭家坊村的农民，现在下地上山都带着一壶凉开水。良好的卫生习惯，通过“人民卫生日”制度的建立，更加巩固和坚持下来。在旅顺，每到人民卫生日，市民中流行着一句口号：“早晨清扫，中午洗澡，晚上检讨”，这已成为他们自觉遵守的一种新的生活规律。
    人民群众在爱国卫生运动中的积极性创造性，得到了很大的发挥，他们为了保持良好的卫生习惯，曾经想了很多办法。沈阳市在很多居民组中建立了将近四千个蔬菜消毒站，以杜绝从蔬菜上带来的各种传染病菌的感染。每家居民从市场上买回来的蔬菜，都先放到消毒液里消过毒才拿回家去，南市区南三经路居民们说：“现在吃了没经过消毒的菜，就像吃了苍蝇似地那样不安心！”沈阳市郊西毛君屯的农民设立了蒸气灭虱站，全村居民送到灭虱站蒸煮的衣服，第一次是六十七件，第三次就增加到一千一百多件。人们感叹地说：“多少年来也没有把虱子治住！真是国家变了样，什么都变了样啊！”
    在爱国卫生运动中，各地人民创造出许多形形色色精工巧制的“卫生武器”。在捕虫方面：有各种形状的捕虫粘网、张口捕虫网、合手捕虫拍、捕虫电灯罩、捕虫灯笼等；在捕鼠方面：有用胶皮带和铁钉制成的“穿鼠箭”，用马尾和竹枝制成的“吊鼠架”，有能进不能出的名叫“迷鼠阵”的铁丝笼，有用活动翻板制成的各种捕鼠箱，还有名叫“千斤闸”“两头堵”的各种捕鼠器具。正是由于这些工具的有效使用，才使得今年的捕鼠捕虫工作出现了空前未有的成绩。全区在三、四两个月内捕鼠一千零三十六万七千八百多只，沈阳市一地在五月份二十天内，就捕灭苍蝇和各种昆虫三千四百多斤。
    爱国卫生运动的好处，已经被千千万万的人民群众所切身体会了。虽然，敌人进行了万恶的细菌战，今年的流行病却比往年大大减少。沈阳市在今年三月到五月内，患伤寒与副伤寒的病人只有去年同时期的百分之十四点八，患痢疾的只有去年同时期的百分之一点三。锦州市今年一月至六月患病的人数比去年同一时期减少了百分之七十三以上。在农村，疾病减少的趋势也是非常显著的。辽东省岫岩县于家岭村流行着这样一句话：“卫生是治病的宝，不花钱也能好！”这个村的张家堡子和胡家堡子，往年生病的人很多，今年当地农民动员起来填平了这两个闾周围的十五个臭水坑，彻底地在屋内屋外进行了清扫，生病的人就少得多了。
    人民政府所领导的爱国卫生运动，在城市和乡村中，博得人们的一致赞扬。辽东省宽甸县东门外村一位七十多岁的高老大娘说：“屋里屋外收拾得这样干净，吃饭睡觉都舒服了，我也可以多活几年了！”沈阳市大东区老虎庙街的妇女们说：“往年四月苍蝇满屋乱飞，孩子白天睡觉，叫苍蝇叮的直哭，现在苍蝇没有了，孩子睡觉也安静了。”
    年少的可以健康地生长，年老的可以延年益寿，这就是今年的爱国卫生运动中，东北人民所普遍感到的一件最愉快最幸福的事情。美国侵略者处心积虑进行的细菌战，在我东北人民强大的爱国卫生战线面前，已经而且必将继续遭到彻底的失败。
