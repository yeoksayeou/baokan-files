    Dense Planting of Wheat Will Definitely Increase Production
    Agricultural Production Department, Ministry of Agriculture

    Promoting the advanced experience of dense wheat planting is an extremely important method for increasing the yield of wheat per unit area. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Trial Outline of Winter Wheat High-Yielding Technology." This outline is formulated based on China's current actual situation and the existing high-yield experiences of many labor models. A major element of these advanced high-yield experiences is the implementation of rational dense planting. Dense planting of wheat means shortening row spacing, increasing the number of plants, and distributing wheat plants evenly when sowing wheat. Dense planting can increase production because: 1. It can fully utilize land fertility, allowing each wheat plant to obtain a suitable growing environment and develop well. 2. It can reduce vacant ground, minimizing the direct sunlight and dry wind erosion on the soil, maintaining moisture in the soil, and facilitating the decomposition of nutrients in the soil. 3. With an increase in wheat plants and a decrease in vacant ground, fewer weeds will grow. 4. Wheat plants can grow uniformly, mature consistently, and have uniform grains.

    As mentioned above, implementing dense planting is the simplest, most reliable, and most effective method for increasing wheat production. In the past, Soviet wheat generally adopted a narrow row sowing method of fifteen centimeters (approximately five inches), but now the row spacing has been reduced to seven and a half centimeters (approximately two and a half inches). The Soviet Union has also invented the method of cross-sowing to evenly increase the number of plants per unit area, further increasing the yield of wheat per unit area. Chinese farmers generally use wide row sowing methods, with the narrowest row spacing being seven inches and the widest reaching one foot five inches. Experience has proven that under the same land and field management conditions, implementing dense planting will definitely increase production. If the advanced experience of dense planting is widely promoted throughout the country, it is estimated that the national wheat production can be increased by about one-third compared to the present.

    Of course, to increase the yield of wheat per unit area, it is not only necessary to implement dense planting, but also to promote comprehensive cultivation techniques; however, various high-yield factors (such as variety, land preparation, irrigation, fertilization, etc.) must be able to fully exert their effectiveness only on the basis of dense planting.

    Critique of Several Erroneous Understandings of Dense Wheat Planting

    Promoting the experience of dense wheat planting is a huge reform in China's agricultural technology. When the Soviet experience of dense planting was first introduced to China in 1947, most people were skeptical. Some people said: Dense planting is only suitable for the soil and climate conditions of the Soviet Union, and the situation in China is not suitable for dense planting. At the North China Agricultural Technology Work Conference in 1950, a debate was held on the issue of dense planting. Under the influence of the traditional habit and erroneous "theory" of wide row sowing, the conference made an erroneous conclusion of "widening row spacing and widening sowing width." Under the guidance of this erroneous conclusion, some areas that practiced narrower row spacing sowing also switched to wide row sowing. Chahar and Suiyuan and other places once advocated changing the three-legged seed drill to a two-legged seed drill to widen the row spacing. This hindered the promotion of the advanced experience of dense planting for increased production. The main reason for this error was a deviation in summarizing high-yield experiences. At that time, some people said: "Widening the row spacing not only does not reduce the harvest, but also increases it." In fact, the reason for the "increased harvest" at that time was mainly due to the surge in farmers' enthusiasm for production and active improvement of technology, as well as the addition of fertilizers, after the liberation of rural productive forces, and not the result of widening the row spacing. However, many people mistakenly regarded widening the row spacing as the main reason for the increased production at that time. This is extremely wrong. Over the past few years, no instance of increased production through wide row sowing has been found in the production practices of Chinese farmers. However, due to the influence of traditional habits, many people still have many misconceptions about dense planting.

    Some people believe that fertilizers cannot be used for dense planting; wheat that is heavily fertilized and densely planted is prone to lodging. To answer this question, it is necessary to first clarify what causes lodging. Test and research materials from various regions have proven that the main reasons for wheat lodging are excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer or poor cultivation techniques. Lodging is not caused by dense planting. With the same sowing quantity, if wide row sowing is used, the plants are crowded together, and excessive nitrogen fertilizer is applied, the stems will grow weakly and naturally be prone to lodging; but if sowing is done evenly and fertilizer is applied rationally, each wheat plant can develop well on average, then the stems will grow strong and will not lodge.

    Some people believe that sparse soil is not suitable for dense planting; how can three people eat their fill on two people's worth of food? This statement is also incorrect. The advanced Soviet soil scientist Williams said: "There is no bad soil, only bad cultivation methods." Sparse soil is mainly due to poor soil structure and lack of water storage and nutrient absorption capacity. By using good cultivation methods to change the soil structure, sparse soil can be transformed into fertile soil. Implementing dense planting is an important measure to improve cultivation methods. Facts have proven that on the same sparse land, densely planted wheat can never grow worse than widely rowed sown wheat. The statement that sparse soil is not suitable for dense planting is the result of the influence of the erroneous "intra-species competition" ideology of bourgeois biologists. This theory is a product of idealism and has no factual basis. Materialist agricultural biological science has long proven that plants of the same species in the same environment will never have a mutually exclusive effect.

    Some people believe that dense planting is prone to rust disease. Therefore, they not only advocate the implementation of wide row, large ridge sowing, but also advocate less fertilization and less irrigation. They believe that this is a good way to reduce rust disease. This is an extremely absurd statement. According to this, wheat cannot be fertilized or densely planted appropriately, and wheat production cannot be increased. The high-yield facts created by many wheat high-yield models are enough to refute this erroneous "theory." We know that people are prone to illness when their bodies are weak, and plants are also prone to illness when they grow poorly. As mentioned earlier, on the basis of dense planting, combined with rational cultivation and management techniques, wheat can grow strongly and enhance the plant's resistance to diseases. The cause of rust disease is the transmission of pathogens; the main methods to prevent rust disease are to improve cultivation techniques and select varieties with strong resistance. Even dense planting will not increase the severity of rust disease.

    Some people believe that dense planting is not conducive to inter-tillage, weeding, and fertilization. This is also incorrect. Since we affirm that implementing dense planting is the correct direction for increasing wheat production, we can ignore this concern. Wheat is not necessarily a crop that requires inter-tillage. It grows in relatively dry and low-temperature seasons, so as long as a series of tasks such as deep plowing and dense planting and harrowing in early spring are done well, soil moisture can be preserved and wheat development can be promoted. Weeds in the field cannot compete with wheat, so there is no need to implement inter-tillage and weeding. If the soil becomes compacted due to irrigation and rain, small farm tools can be used to loosen the soil. Pre-fertilization can be applied before harrowing in early spring. Post-fertilization can be carried out by hand or by water irrigation.

    Promote Advanced Dense Planting Experiences Suitable for Specific Local Conditions

    To what extent is dense planting appropriate? The Soviet Union's wheat sowing quantity and sowing method are determined based on the experiments of scientific research institutions and the results of long-term production practices; there are different standards in different regions. When we learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we must also consider different soil and climate conditions, rather than mechanically applying them. We should find appropriate dense planting methods based on the specific conditions of various regions. Of course, this is closely related to changing sowing methods and improving agricultural tools, but we must not wait until we have the final test results and new agricultural tools before promoting the advanced experience of dense planting. We should conduct research and experiments on the one hand, and promote the dense planting methods that can be promoted currently on the other hand. Therefore, we should carefully study and promote the existing dense planting experience of advanced farmers in China and the results of scientific institution experiments.

    In areas where the wheat sowing row spacing is narrower, advanced farmers generally adopt the method of widening the sowing width and increasing the sowing quantity, while improving cultivation techniques to obtain high yields. The wheat of Zhang Deyou in Shanxi has a row spacing of seven inches, a sowing width of four inches, and a sowing quantity of 22 jin per mu, with a harvest of up to 834 jin. The wheat of Zhang Aixin in Pingyuan has a row spacing of six inches, and each row is replanted once every half an inch or one inch, with appropriate plant density and even distribution, a sowing quantity of 15 jin per mu, and a harvest of more than 800 jin.

    No new record of high wheat yield has been found in areas that practice wide row sowing. This fully demonstrates that wide row sowing has great shortcomings. The Shuangqiao Practice Farm, directly under the Ministry of Agriculture, conducted large-scale dense planting experiments, and the results were: 166 mu of wheat fields using the 1.5-foot wide row sowing method yielded an average of 138.5 jin per mu, and 93 mu of wheat fields implementing the 5-inch row spacing dense planting method yielded an average of 260.6 jin per mu. The varieties, sowing time, germination rate, and other cultivation conditions used in these two sowing methods were completely the same. This experiment fully demonstrates the superiority of the dense planting method and provides a demonstration for shortening the row spacing for wide row areas.

    Farmers in Yexian County, Shandong Province, have created a method of cultivating "Wo Mai" [Note 1] in their many years of production practice. They use equidistant ditching to sow wheat, with both row spacing and sowing width being about six inches, and the seeds are sown evenly. Generally, each mu can harvest about 500 jin, and those with better cultivation techniques can harvest more than 700 jin. Most of the areas where "Wo Mai" is planted lack base fertilizer, and the soil structure is not very good, so the potential ability of wheat to increase production has not been fully utilized. This year, the Laiwu County Farm in Shandong Province applied the "double-hoe ditch" sowing method [Note 2], with a row spacing of 1.2 feet and a sowing width of 8 inches, and a sowing quantity of 17 jin per mu; due to better cultivation techniques than "Wo Mai", the average yield per mu reached 915 jin, creating a new record for high wheat yield in the country. However, the row spacing is still too wide, and the sowing quantity can still be increased; if further improvements are made, the yield per unit area can be further improved.

    From the above facts, it can be seen that Chinese farmers have created the experience of dense wheat planting in production practice, which shortens the row spacing, widens the sowing width, and evenly increases the number of planted plants per unit area. These experiences powerfully prove that implementing dense planting can continue to increase wheat production.

    The principles of dense wheat planting include three contents: shortening row spacing, widening sowing width, and increasing sowing quantity. According to China's current cultivation conditions, such as widening the sowing width on the basis of having already shortened the row spacing, the yield of wheat per unit area can be greatly increased. However, the general sowing quantity of Chinese farmers is relatively small. Only shortening the row spacing and widening the sowing width without increasing the sowing quantity cannot fully exploit the potential ability of wheat to increase production. The wheat of Li Shuzhen in Jiexiu, Shanxi yielded 729 jin per mu. The soil, fertilizer, and cultivation conditions of local farmer Li Shengxiang were no less than those of Li Shuzhen, but because the sowing quantity per mu was 13 jin less, the yield was 229 jin less than that of Li Shuzhen. From this, it can be seen that shortening row spacing, widening sowing width, and increasing sowing quantity are closely related. When these three are appropriately coordinated, wheat production will inevitably have a significant effect.

    [Note 1] When some farmers in Yexian County, Shandong Province, plant wheat, they sow the seeds very evenly in wide ditches that have been watered, spread with manure, and prepared very carefully. Because the wheat seedlings seem to grow in manure and water nests, local farmers call it "Wo Mai". (See page 2 of this newspaper on September 7 for details)

    [Note 2] In the sowing wide ditch, use a two-toothed hoe to rake both sides of the ditch, leaving a small ridge in the middle of the sowing ditch, dividing it into two small ditches, and then sowing seeds. Shandong farmers call this method "double-hoe ditch".

    实行小麦密植一定能够增产
    中央人民政府农业部农业生产司
    推广小麦密植的先进经验，是提高小麦单位面积产量的一个极为重要的办法。最近中央人民政府农业部颁布了“冬小麦丰产技术试行纲要”，这个纲要是根据我国目前实际情况和许多劳动模范已有的丰产经验制定的。这些先进丰产经验中的一个主要内容就是实行合理密植。小麦密植，就是在播种小麦时缩短行距，增加种植的株数，并且使小麦植株分布均匀。密植所以能够增产，是因为：一、可以充分利用地力，使每株小麦得到适当的生长环境，都能很好地发育起来。二、可以减少空闲地面，使土壤少受阳光直射和旱风侵袭，保持土壤中的水分，有利于土壤中养分的分解。三、小麦植株增加，空闲地面减少，可以少生杂草。四、小麦植株可以生长整齐，成熟一致，籽粒均匀。
    如上所述，实行密植是使小麦增产的最简易、最可靠、最有效的方法。苏联小麦过去一般是采用十五公分（约五寸）的窄行播种法，现在又把行距缩小到七点五公分（约二寸半）。苏联并且发明了交叉播种的方法，以便均匀地增加单位面积的株数，使小麦的单位面积产量更加提高。我国农民一般都惯用宽行播种法，最窄的行距也有七寸，宽的竟达一尺五寸。经验证明，在同样土地、同样田间管理条件下，实行密植一定能够增产。如果把先进密植的经验普遍推广到全国去，估计全国小麦产量约可比现在增加三分之一。
    当然，为了提高小麦的单位面积产量，不仅需要实行密植，而且需要推广综合性的栽培技术；但各种丰产因子（如品种、整地、灌溉、施肥等）必须在密植的基础上才能充分发挥其效能。
    批判对小麦密植的几种错误认识
    推广小麦密植经验，是我国农业技术上的一个巨大的改革。一九四七年苏联密植经验刚传到我国时，大部分人是怀疑的。有人说：密植只适宜于苏联的土壤气候条件，中国的情况是不适于密植的。在一九五零年华北农业技术工作会议上，对于密植问题，曾经展开争论。会议在宽行播种的传统习惯和错误“理论”的影响下，竟作了一个错误的“放宽行距，加宽播幅”的结论。在这种错误结论的指导下，有些实行较窄行距播种的地区，也改为宽行播种。察哈尔、绥远等地就曾提倡改三腿耧为两腿耧，以加宽行距。这样就阻碍了密植增产的先进经验的推广。发生这样的错误的主要原因，是在总结丰产经验时发生了偏差。当时有人说：“加宽行距，不但不少收，而且还能多收。”实际上当时所以“多收”，主要是农村生产力获得解放后，农民生产情绪高涨，积极改进技术，加工加肥的结果，并不是放宽行距的结果。可是许多人却把加宽行距当成了当时增产的主要原因。这是极端错误的。几年来，在我国农民的生产实践中还没有找到一个宽行播种能够增产的实例。但是，由于传统习惯的影响，不少人现在对于密植仍然有许多错误的认识。
    有人认为：肥料多了不能密植；小麦多肥密植容易倒伏。为了回答这个问题，首先应该弄明白倒伏究竟是什么原因造成的。各地试验研究材料证明，小麦倒伏的主要原因是施用氮肥过多，或者耕作技术不良。倒伏并不是密植引起的。同样的播种量，如果用宽行播种，植株挤在一起，施用过多的氮肥，茎杆生长软弱，自然容易倒伏；但如均匀地播种，合理地施肥，每株小麦能够得到平均地良好地发育，那末，茎杆生长健壮，是不会倒伏的。
    有人认为：土壤瘠薄，不能密植；两个人的饭，三个人怎么能吃饱呢？这种说法也是不对的。苏联先进的土壤学家威廉斯说：“没有不良的土壤，只有不良的耕作方法。”土壤瘠薄，主要是由于土壤结构不良，缺乏蓄水及吸收养分的能力。运用良好的耕作方法，改变土壤结构，就能把瘠薄的土壤变成肥沃的土壤。实行密植正是改进耕作方法的一个重要措施。事实证明，在同样瘠薄的土地上，密植的小麦生长得决不可能比宽行播种的更坏。土壤瘠薄不能实行密植的说法，是资产阶级生物学者错误的“种内竞争”思想影响的结果。这种学说是唯心论的产物，是没有事实根据的。唯物的农业生物科学早已证明：同种植物在同一环境中，是决不会有互相排挤的作用的。
    有人认为：密植容易发生锈病。因此，他们不仅主张实行宽行大垅播种法，同时还主张少施肥、少灌水。他们认为这是减轻锈病的好办法。这是极其荒谬的说法。照这样说，种小麦既不能加工施肥，又不能适当地密植，小麦的产量就不可能提高了。许多小麦丰产模范创造的高额产量的事实，已足以批驳这种错误的“理论”。我们知道，人的身体弱了容易害病，植物生长不良同样容易生病。前面已经说过，在密植的基础上，配合合理的栽培管理技术，可使小麦生长健壮，也就可以增强植株对于病害的抵抗力。锈病的起因是病菌的传染；防止锈病的主要办法是改善栽培技术和选择抗病力强的品种。均匀密植是不会增加锈病为害的严重性的。
    有人认为：实行密植不便于中耕除草和施肥。这也是不对的。我们既然肯定实行密植是增产小麦的正确方向，对于这一点就可以不用顾虑。小麦并不是一定需要中耕的作物。它生长在比较干燥和低温季节，因此，只要做好深耕密植和早春耙地等一系列的工作，就能保墒和促进小麦的发育。田间杂草不能和小麦竞争，也就没有实行中耕除草的必要了。如果土壤由于灌溉和下雨发生了板结的现象，可用小型农具松土。前期追肥，在早春耙地前施用是没有问题的。后期补肥可以采用手撒或水浇的办法来进行。
    推广适合各地具体情况的先进密植经验
    密植到什么程度才算适当呢？苏联的小麦播种量和播种方法是根据科学研究机关的试验和长期生产实践的结果确定的；在不同地区有不同的标准。我们学习苏联的先进经验，也要考虑不同的土壤气候条件，而不是机械地加以搬用。我们应该根据各地的具体情况，找出适当的密植方法。当然，这与改变播种方式和改良农具有密切的关系，但我们决不能等待有了最后的试验结果，有了新的农具以后才去推广密植先进经验。我们应该一方面进行研究和试验，一方面推广当前可以推广的密植方法。因此，我们应当认真研究和推广我国先进农民已有的密植经验和科学机关试验的结果。
    在小麦播种行距较窄的地区，先进农民一般都采用了加宽播幅、增加播种量的办法，同时提高耕作技术，获得了高额产量。山西张德有的小麦，行距七寸，播幅四寸，每亩播种量为二十二斤，收获量高达八百三十四斤。平原张爱欣的小麦，行距六寸，每行移半寸或一寸重播一次，植株疏密适当，分布均匀，每亩播种量为十五斤，收获量达到八百斤以上。
    实行宽行播种的地区，现在还没有发现一个小麦丰产的新纪录。这就充分说明了宽行播种有很大的缺点。中央农业部直属双桥实习农场做了大面积的密植试验，得到的结果是：一百六十六亩用一尺五寸的宽行播种法的麦田，每亩平均产一百三十八点五斤，九十三亩实行行距五寸的密植播种法的麦田，每亩平均产二百六十点六斤。这两种播种方法所用的品种、播种时期、发芽率及其他栽培条件完全相同。这一试验，充分地说明了密植法的优越性，给宽行地区做了一个缩短行距的示范。
    山东掖县一带农民，在多年的生产实践中，创造了一种窝麦〔注一〕栽培方法。他们用等距离开沟的办法播种小麦，行距播幅都在六寸左右，种子播得均匀，一般每亩可以收获五百斤左右，耕作技术较好的，可以收获七百斤以上。种窝麦的地区，大部分缺乏基肥，土壤结构并不太好，还没有把小麦增产的潜在能力充分发挥出来。今年山东莱芜县农场应用“双镢沟”的播种法〔注二〕，行距一尺二寸，播幅八寸，每亩播种量十七斤；由于栽培技术比窝麦好，每亩平均产量达到九百一十五斤，创造了全国小麦丰产的新纪录。但行距还嫌太宽，播种量还可能增加；如果再加改进，单位面积产量还可能更加提高。
    从以上事实可以看到，我国农民在生产实践中，已经创造了缩短行距、加宽播幅、均匀地增加单位面积的种植株数的小麦密植经验。这些经验有力地证明了实行密植可以使小麦的产量继续提高。
    小麦密植的原则，包括缩短行距、加宽播幅、增加播种量三个内容。根据我国目前的耕作条件，如在已经缩短了行距的基础上加宽播种幅度，就可以大大提高小麦单位面积产量。但是，我国农民一般的播种量都是较少的，只缩短行距和加宽播幅，不增加播种量，还是不能充分发挥小麦增产的潜在能力。山西介休李树贞的小麦，每亩收获七百二十九斤，当地老农李生祥的土壤、肥料和耕作栽培条件都不在李树贞以下，只因每亩播种量少了十三斤，产量就比李树贞减少二百二十九斤。由此可见，缩短行距、加宽播幅和增加播种量有密切关系。这三者适当地配合起来，小麦增产必然会有显著的效果。
    〔注一〕山东掖县有些农民在种麦的时候，把种子很均匀地撒种在灌了水、铺了粪、整理得很细致的宽沟里。因为麦苗好像生长在粪水窝里，当地农民把它叫作“窝麦”。（详见本报九月七日第二版）
    〔注二〕在播种的宽沟内，用二齿钩搜搂沟的两侧，使播沟中间留一小埂，分成两小沟，再撒种子。山东农民把这种方法叫做“双镢沟”。
