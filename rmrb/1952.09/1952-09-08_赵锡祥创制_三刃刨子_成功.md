    Zhao Xixiang Successfully Creates "Three-Blade Plane"
    Editor: Zhao Xixiang, a carpenter from the Fourth Team of the Taiyuan City Construction Engineering Company, has successfully created a "three-blade plane," increasing work efficiency by more than four times.

    When making door and window frames recently, Zhao Xixiang felt that the process from raw material to finished frame involved planing, marking, rabbeting, and molding. Each process required one person, making the work cumbersome, and not all the finished products met the standards. Therefore, based on the principle of multi-blade cutting, he combined three different blades on one plane body, arranged in a triangular shape. The flat blade is installed in the middle to replace the large plane for flattening; the rabbeting and molding blades are installed on both sides of the flat blade. After using this tool, the process has been simplified. The work that used to require four people can now be done by two, and the problem of substandard products has been overcome. The work previously done by experienced workers can now be done by apprentices and ordinary workers with less skill.

    赵锡祥创制“三刃刨子”成功
    编辑同志：太原市建筑工程公司第四队木工赵锡祥，创造“三刃刨子”成功，工作效率提高四倍多。
    赵锡祥在最近做门窗框时，感到从毛料到成框，要经过刨平、划线、裁口、起线等工序，操作时每个工序都需要一人，工作手续繁多，作出的活还不能都合格。于是，他便根据多刀多刃切削法的原理，把三种不同的刨刃凑在一个刨身上，按装成品字形。平刃按在中间，代替大刨刨平；裁口、起线刃按在刨平刃两边。使用这个工具后，工序简单化了，过去四个人操作的工作，现在两个人就成了，还克服了产品不合规格的毛病。过去大工干的活，现在徒工和技术较差的普通工人也能干了。
