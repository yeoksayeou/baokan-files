    Bank of Communications, Nanjing Branch, Should Immediately Abolish the Unreasonable System of Requiring Shop Guarantees from Employees
    To the Editor: Since the "Five-Anti" movement, many private factories and stores have abolished feudal practices such as humiliating employment contracts, guarantees, and cash deposits, and other unreasonable systems that degrade employee dignity. After being freed from the shackles of these "indentures," the vast number of employees once again experienced the greatness, glory, and correctness of the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership and felt the joy of liberation.

    The Bank of Communications, Nanjing Branch, is a joint state-private enterprise, but it still retains this unreasonable system. Now I am informing you of the situation, hoping to urge them to correct it.

    In early August, my brother completed his studies at the Bank of Communications East China Region Cadre Training Class and was assigned to work at the Nanjing Branch of the bank. Although he held a letter of introduction from the Personnel Department of the East China Military and Political Committee to the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Personnel Bureau, the Personnel Section of the Bank of Communications Nanjing Branch still issued a guarantee form to my brother, requiring him to find a "reputable shop to guarantee" or two people "with a reputation in the local community" to act as guarantors. It was also stipulated that the guarantors should bear unlimited liability and abandon all "rights of appeal and defense."

    I believe that the Bank of Communications Nanjing Branch does not trust the letter of introduction from the East China Personnel Department and requires employees to fill out a guarantee similar to an "indenture." This is not an ordinary system or procedural issue, but a matter of principle. I hope that the Bank of Communications Nanjing Branch will correct this mistake in a timely manner, and I suggest that the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government consider completely abolishing unreasonable systems such as "shop guarantees" nationwide.　Zhou Xiuqing

### 交通银行南京分行应即废除向职工要铺保等不合理制度

    交通银行南京分行应即废除向职工要铺保等不合理制度
    编辑同志：“五反”运动以来，许多私营工厂、商店，都废除了封建性的侮辱职工人格的关约、保单、押柜金等不合理的制度。在解脱了这种“卖身契”的束缚后，广大职工再一次体验到党和毛主席领导的伟大、光荣和正确，并感到翻身后的喜悦。
    交通银行南京分行是一个公私合营的企业单位，到现在却保留着这种不合理的制度。现在我把情况告诉你们，希望督促他们改正。
    八月初，我的哥哥在交通银行华东区行干部训练班学习期满，被分配在该行南京分行工作。他虽持有华东军政委员会人事部给南京市人民政府人事局的介绍信，但交通银行南京分行的人事股仍发了一张保证书给我哥哥，要他找一家“殷实铺保”或是二个“在当地社会上享有声誉”的人作保，还规定保人要负无限责任，并要抛弃一切“上诉抗辩之权”。
    我认为：交通银行南京分行不相信华东人事部的介绍信，而要职工填写类似“卖身契”的保证书。这不是一个普通的制度或手续问题，而是一个原则性的问题。希望交通银行南京分行及时纠正这个错误，并建议中央人民政府人事部考虑在全国范围内彻底废除“铺保”等不合理的制度。　周修庆
