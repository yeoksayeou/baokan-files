Xinhua News Agency, September 15th:

    The International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China interrogated John Quinn, a captured American Air Force lieutenant pilot, in a certain location in Korea.
    Quinn first gave the commission members a brief account of what he had heard about courses on bacteriological warfare and atomic bombs, as well as his experience dropping bacteriological bombs on Pyongyang on January 4th and Gunwi-ri on January 11th. He told the commission members: "I participated in bacteriological warfare, and I am ashamed of it. If I had had a sense of justice at the time, even though I was a soldier, I should have refused to carry those bacteriological bombs." He said: "I thank you all for shouldering the responsibility that I should have shouldered. I am willing to do my best to cooperate with you in the work you are committed to."
    He then talked about his feelings after dropping the bacteriological bombs, saying: "At the time, I could easily see that I would have to drop bacteriological bombs, and in turn, I also thought about how terrible it would be if one day such a bomb fell on my family. I also knew that bacteriological bombs had been dropped on civilian residential areas. I don't hate the Korean people, and I don't hate the Chinese people, even at the time of the bombing. What I loathe is killing civilians—killing those who cannot defend themselves and don't even know why there is a war. Although science is developed, it is very difficult to prevent the spread of diseases after the war. However, now science is not used to prevent the spread of diseases, but to promote the spread of diseases. I was ashamed of having to participate and having already participated in this matter, and I still feel ashamed. I know that the most important role I can play in the current struggle for peace is the role I can play in the struggle against bacteriological warfare. I am willing to play the role I can play."
    Quinn then answered some technical questions raised by Mandel (France) about dropping bacteriological bombs. He pointed out that when he dropped the bacteriological bombs, his flight altitude was 200 feet, his flight speed was 150 to 160 miles per hour, and he used standard methods of operation. He talked about how he noticed that there were no fuzes on the bacteriological bombs under the wings before taking off. He also answered questions raised by Joseph Needham (United Kingdom) about the structure of the containers and bacteriological bombs to the best of his knowledge. These answers were completely consistent with the situation he mentioned in his confession on April 13th.
    When Quinn answered a question raised by Olivo (Italy) about the process of his ideological transformation, he said: "When I accepted the task of bacteriological warfare, I felt revulsion in my heart. But this transformation, the real transformation, was really due to the benevolence of the Chinese People's Volunteers. I had an opportunity to learn about politics and economics. I had no knowledge of this before. I didn't know why wars happened. I only knew that war had arrived. I used to believe that the United States was always right. I never believed that anyone in the United States would launch something like bacteriological warfare for selfish interests. But now I have discovered that a person who calls himself an American is not necessarily a good person."
    Quinn answered a question raised by Zhukov-Vereshnikov (Soviet Union)—about how his companions reacted to bacteriological warfare. He pointed out: "Bacteriological warfare was an extremely secret matter at the time, and even we ourselves were not allowed to talk about it. I talked to the people in my own room. Of the seven people who lived in the same room as me, I knew that four of them participated in bacteriological warfare, that was until I was shot down on January 13th." He said: "Their reaction was exactly the same as mine. This matter came upon us so suddenly that before we had a chance to arouse a sense of justice and refuse to carry out orders, we had unwittingly participated in it. I don't know what makes a person decide to do this, but after a person participates in such a bad thing, he will imagine that it may not be that bad, and then he will think about how terrible it was when people first used explosive bombs, and after carrying out bacteriological warfare, it may not be that bad... That's how our thinking works. In fact, it is gradually making things seem reasonable."
    Needham asked Quinn: Are there any documents in the U.S. military code about various war regulations? If so, aren't U.S. Air Force personnel bothered by the fact that what they are asked to do may or may not be in line with the instructions included in the code? Quinn replied: "I naturally know that bacteriological warfare is stipulated as illegal by international conventions, whether it is the Geneva Convention or something else, I don't know. I can't be sure whether these regulations are in military regulations or similar documents, I can't remember where I knew this from. In fact, at the time I did not have the basic knowledge to deal with such a problem. This question made me feel uneasy. I felt it was wrong. This is what really affected me at the time, not because what had happened was a violation of any convention. In fact, it is often heard in the army—I am not saying that a colonel or something like that said this in an official announcement, that such regulations do not apply to the Communists. Somehow, that idea spread."
    After answering the various questions raised by the members of the International Scientific Commission, Quinn said that he wanted to say a few words to the commission members. He said: "I am an American, and I am proud. I am proud of the precious traditions of the American people. I am proud of the American blood that has been dyed on the red stripes of our national flag in the past. But today our national flag—the flag I have sworn allegiance to—is being thrown into the mud, because I am a person who participated in bacteriological warfare, and I helped others throw the national flag in the mud. I helped others to tarnish its honor, to tarnish the honor of those who sacrificed their lives for it. Today, I want to help people take the national flag out of the mud. I want to hold up the national flag to the American people, so that they can know, as I already know, that there are some people—those who are responsible for bacteriological warfare—who want to ruin the honor of their national flag. I vow to take any necessary steps together with them—the American people—to ensure that the honor of their national flag will never be tarnished again. I am a soldier, but I am also a human being. I have thoughts and feelings. As a soldier, I participated in bacteriological warfare in the past. But as a normal person, I hate bacteriological warfare, and I hate those who are responsible for it. If they are not stopped, if bacteriological warfare is not outlawed; although this is only being carried out in Korea today, tomorrow, it may be carried out in other parts of the world, and perhaps my own family will become the target of bacteriological warfare. I say these words with intense emotion. Today, August 3rd (Note: refers to the expected date of delivery), my wife will give birth to a baby. Before this child is born, those who are responsible for bacteriological warfare are threatening his life. They not only threaten him with bacteriological bombs, but also, by using bacteriological bombs, they recklessly shake the already unstable world situation and must be stopped. And I think that our declaration that bacteriological warfare is a monster will make a great contribution. The American people find it almost impossible to believe that there are people in their country who can carry out bacteriological warfare. When they understand the truth, they will oppose those who are responsible for bacteriological warfare, just as I am doing now." Quinn finally earnestly requested the members of the commission to help the American people understand the facts.
    Joseph Needham, on behalf of the members of the commission, expressed his gratitude to Quinn for his earnest and honest testimony and friendly and cooperative attitude. The interrogation then ended. (Attached picture)

### 国际科学委员会询问美俘奎恩

    国际科学委员会询问美俘奎恩
    【新华社十五日讯】调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会，在朝鲜某地询问了被俘的美国空军中尉驾驶员约翰·奎恩。
    奎恩首先向委员会委员们简单地陈述了他听到关于细菌战和原子弹课程的情形，以及他一月四日在平壤、一月十一日在军隅里投掷细菌弹的经过。他向委员会委员们表示：我参加了细菌战，这使我羞愧。假如当时我有正义感，尽管我是一个士兵，我应该拒绝携带那些细菌弹。他说：我感谢你们大家肩负了我所应该担负的责任。我愿意竭尽全力和你们合作进行你们所致力的工作。
    他于是谈到他在投掷细菌弹后的感想说：在当时，我很容易看到，我将必得去投细菌弹，而反过来我也曾想到假如有一天这种弹落到我的家庭该是多么可怕的情景。我也知道细菌弹已投掷到平民居住地方。我并不恨朝鲜人民，也不恨中国人民，即使在投弹的当时我也不恨他们。我厌恶的是杀害平民——杀害那些不能自御和甚至不知道为什么有战争的人。科学虽然发达，要制止战争之后的疾病蔓延也是十分困难的，可是，现在科学不是用来防止疾病的传布，而是用来促使疾病蔓延。对于我不得不参加而且已经参加在这里面一事，我曾经感到羞愧，现在还感到羞愧。我知道，我在目前争取和平的斗争中所能起的最重要的作用，就是我在反对细菌战的斗争中所能起的作用。我愿意起我所能够起的作用。
    奎恩接着回答了马戴尔（法国）提出的关于投掷细菌弹时的一些技术问题。他指出，他投细菌弹时，飞行高度是二百英尺，飞行速度是每小时一百五十到一百六十英里，用标准方法操纵。他谈到他在起飞前注意到机翼下没有信管的细菌弹的情形。他并就所知情形回答了李约瑟（英国）提出的关于容器和细菌弹构造的问题。这些回答和他在四月十三日所作的供词中提到的情形是完全符合的。
    奎恩在回答欧利佛（意大利）提出的关于他的思想转变过程的问题时说：在我接受细菌战任务的时候，心里就对细菌战起反感。但是这种转变，真正的转变，实在是由于中国志愿军的仁慈才产生的。我有了一个学习政治和经济的机会。以前我对此毫无知识。我不知道发生战争的原因。我只知道战争到来。我曾相信美国永远是对的。以前我从来不相信在美国有人会为了自私的利益而发动像细菌战之类的事情。但是，我现在发现了：一个自称为美国人的人并不见得就一定是好人。
    奎恩回答了茹科夫—维勒斯尼科夫（苏联）提出的问题——关于他的同伴们对于细菌战的反应如何。他指出：细菌战在当时是极端秘密的事情，甚至我们自己人中间也不许谈论。我曾经和我自己房间里的人谈过。和我同住一屋的七个人里面，我知道有四个人参加了细菌战，那是到一月十三日我被打下来时为止。他说：他们的反应和我的反应完全
    一样。这件事临到我们头上是这样突然，在我们有机会激起正义感而拒绝执行命令之前，已不明不白地参加进去了。我不知道是什么东西使一个人决定做这件事，但是，一个人参加了这样坏的事情以后，他就会设想它或许不那样坏，于是就会想到人家最初使用爆炸弹时，在当时是多么可怕，在进行细菌战之后，也许不见得会那样坏。……这就是我们思想活动的情况。其实就是逐渐把事情看得合理了。
    李约瑟问奎恩：在美军操典中有没有各种关于战争法规的文件。如果有的话，美国空军人员对于要求他们去做的事情可能或不可能和操典中所包括的指示相符合的这种事，不感到烦恼吗？奎恩回答说：我自然知道细菌战是被国际公约规定为非法的，是日内瓦公约还是什么，我就不知道了。我不能肯定在军事法规之类的文件中是否有这些规定，我记不清从哪里知道这一点的。事实上在当时我还没有具备足以应付那样一个问题的基本知识。这个问题使我情绪不安。我感觉到那是错了。这是当时真正对我有影响的东西，而不是因为已经发生的这种事情是违反什么公约的。事实上，在军队里常常听到——我不是说一位上校之类的人物在官方公告中这样说，诸如此类的法规是不适用于共产党的。不知怎么回事，那种观念就传开了。
    奎恩在回答了国际科学委员会委员们提出的各个问题之后，表示要向委员会委员们说几句话。他说：我是个美国人，我感到骄傲。我对于美国人民的宝贵的传统感到骄傲。我对于过去染在我们国旗的红条上的美国人的鲜血感到骄傲。但是，今天我们的国旗——我所效忠的国旗，正被摔到污泥里去，因为我是个参加细菌战的人，我帮助了旁人把国旗摔在污泥里。我帮助了旁人玷污它的荣誉，玷污了那些为它而牺牲生命的人们的荣誉。今天，我要帮助人们把国旗从污泥中取出来。我要向美国人民高举起国旗，使他们能够有像我已经知道的那样，知道有那么一些人——那些对细菌战应负责任的人，要糟蹋他们的国旗的荣誉。我誓愿同他们——美国人民，
    一起采取任何必要的步骤，保证他们的国旗的荣誉永不再受玷污。我是个士兵，但是我也是人。我有思想，也有感情。作为一个士兵，我过去参加了细菌战。但是，作为一个通常的人，我恨细菌战，并且恨那些应对它负责任的人。假使不制止他们，假使不把细菌战列为非法的；虽然今天这只是在朝鲜进行，明天，就可能在世界的其他地方进行，或许我自己的家庭会成为细菌战的目标。我说这些话，情绪是激动的。今天，八月三日（按：指预产期），我的妻子将生下一个婴孩。在这个孩子出生以前，那些应对细菌战负责任的人便威胁着他的生命了。他们不仅用细菌弹威胁他，并且由于用细菌弹，他们肆无忌惮地摇撼了本来就不稳定的世界局势，必须制止他们。而我认为我们现在宣布细菌战这个鬼怪为非法，会有很大的贡献。美国人民觉得几乎不可能相信在他们的国家里竟有人能够进行细菌战。当他们了解真实情况后，他们便将像我现在所作的这样，反对那些应对细菌战负责任的人。奎恩最后恳切地要求委员会的委员们帮助美国人民弄清事实。
    李约瑟最后代表委员会的委员们，对奎恩恳切诚实的证词和友好合作的态度，表示谢意。询问于是结束。（附图片）
