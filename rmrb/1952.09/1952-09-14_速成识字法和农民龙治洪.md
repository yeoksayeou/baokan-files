    The Quick Literacy Method and Farmer Long Zhihong
    Li Wen

    Long Zhihong is the leader of an agricultural production mutual aid team in Xiashen Street Village, Lin County, Pingyuan Province. He is forty-five years old this year. In early June, he and seven other young and middle-aged members of his team all participated in the village's quick literacy learning class. These days, their team has become active. In the past, they often buried themselves in work, and no one said a word during a morning's work. Now, when they work, you ask me to say a new word, I ask you to spell a pinyin, they talk and laugh, the work is done quickly and well, and they don't feel tired. Long Zhihong himself can't say what kind of excitement it is, but one change is obvious: in the past, he liked to doze off and was not very enthusiastic about attending various meetings. After a busy day's work, he would fall asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. In spring and summer, the nights are short, and he always had to take a nap at noon every day. Now, as soon as he puts down his rice bowl, he rushes to the people's school with paper and pen to study; he is also enthusiastic about various activities in the village. Recently, their group has also developed a new habit of gathering together every night to study for several hours. One night, Long Zhihong didn't return home until very late. Before dawn, he lit the lamp again to write a reply to his younger brother who lived in Shanxi. His wife discovered this and said with both anger and concern, "Look at you these days, you've learned to write a few words, and you don't even sleep. What if you get sick?" He replied with enthusiasm, "Don't worry, as long as I'm happy, I guarantee I won't get sick!"
    What is it that makes Long Zhihong so energetic? This is the joy of the laboring people, who have been oppressed for a lifetime, being liberated once again (cultural liberation)!
    Long Zhihong only studied for half a year when he was eleven years old. Then he followed his old father to Shanxi to escape the famine. His father worked for the landlord, and he herded cattle and sheep. From the age of fifteen, he worked for the landlord for more than twenty years. After liberation, he returned to his hometown and participated in the land reform movement, where he was allocated land. Since then, he has no longer been oppressed, and his life has improved. However, one problem often made him feel depressed: his two brothers settled down in Shanxi and often wrote to him. He repeatedly asked the teachers of the people's school to read and write replies for him. The teachers were very busy, and he himself felt that it was too much trouble for them. After the establishment of the mutual aid team, everyone elected him as the leader, and the distress of having no culture became increasingly great. In the mutual aid team, he couldn't record the work points. He was eager to read the reports about the good experiences of mutual aid teams in various places, but he didn't recognize the words in the newspapers. However, he was also reluctant to go to the people's school. He felt that he could only recognize three or five words a day, and he would forget them as he learned them. He was almost fifty years old, and he wouldn't be able to learn anything in his old age. He sent his son and daughter to elementary school. His wife said, "What's the use of girls going to school?" He criticized her, "You really have an old-fashioned mind. I've tasted the bitterness of having no culture for half my life. Society is advancing day by day, and the future of the children cannot be delayed!" At this time, he did not expect that he could still learn culture himself.
    On June 5th, the teachers of the people's school returned to the village from training in the county, bringing back good news: with the quick literacy method, one can recognize more than a hundred new words a day, and in two and a half months, one can complete the four volumes of the people's school textbooks, be able to read newspapers, and also write simple letters. Long Zhihong's desire to learn culture, which had been buried in his heart, was suddenly triggered. He hurriedly found the village cadre and said, "I wonder if the learning class needs people over forty years old? I really want to participate. This good opportunity cannot be missed!" The village cadre told him that adults could participate in the study as long as they studied to the end, they would surely learn well. His wife did not believe that one could learn more than a hundred words a day, and poured "cold water" on him, saying, "People over thirty don't learn skills, and you're over forty years old. What can you learn? I don't think it can be done!" Long Zhihong said, "Even if I can't learn great knowledge, can't I still read letters and newspapers!"
    The quick literacy learning class officially started, with two hours of classes every noon during the break. In the first lesson, Long Zhihong was stunned. Why were they learning foreign languages in such a winding way? He felt very uncomfortable, his mouth didn't listen to his command, he felt anxious, and his pronunciation became more and more inaccurate. He was thinking of asking the teacher to demote him to the temporary class as an auditor when Teacher Niu saw through his thoughts and encouraged him, "Don't worry, you'll learn it slowly." When he calmed down, he blamed himself, "Why do I want to retreat when I encounter this difficulty? Volunteer soldier Cai Jintong repelled the enemy's charge several times alone. His intestines were broken, but he still insisted on crawling back to the team. I only have two hours of classes every day. Can't I persevere?" So, he announced his learning covenant to everyone: "No tardiness, no early departure, no missing classes, and persistence to the end!"
    At night, he couldn't sleep for a while, so he pondered the shape of each phonetic alphabet, drawing it on his body. Gradually, he became familiar with the thirty letters. He thought, "It's not that I can't learn, it's that I haven't put in enough effort." Only then did he fall asleep groggily.
    When learning pinyin and intensively studying new words, Long Zhihong and his team members became even more nervous. Single-character notebooks and pencil stubs became their two treasures that they carried with them. They spelled whatever they saw, and learned wherever they went. Several people hoed weeds together, spelling "hoe" and "weed." During the break, they surrounded each other, took out their notebooks, and reviewed and explained new words. When Long Zhihong returned home and saw his wife making soles for shoes, he spelled "needle" and "thread." When eating, he held the bowl and thought about new words. He learned from the fields to his home, from his home to the "food market," and even when he went to the toilet, he was still chanting letters in his mouth… In this way, he learned the letters and pinyin in four days, and in twelve days, he intensively studied all the more than 2,300 new words in the single-character notebook.
    Then, he read the first, second, third, and fourth volumes of the people's school textbooks, the propagandist's manual, and also selected articles from the Pingyuan Daily. On August 5th, he read the newspaper for the first time in his life. The teacher circled an article commemorating the "August 1st" Festival for him. At first, he didn't quite believe in himself, but as he read word by word, he finished the entire article in one breath. There were only three new words. He was so happy that he didn't know what to do, like suddenly meeting a long-lost relative. He looked at the newspaper left and right, reluctant to let it go.
    Learning advanced step by step, and each step brought Long Zhihong difficulties, but also brought him greater excitement and joy.
    When it came to writing, Long Zhihong's hands, which were used to holding hoes, trembled when he first picked up a pen. He couldn't write, writing some words too big, some too small, one word written in two halves, unable to put them together. In less than an hour, he was already sweating profusely. However, he was not discouraged. The achievement of learning more than 2,000 words in twelve days encouraged him. He ordered a thick writing book and patiently copied it every day. In seven or eight days, the whole book was full of writing. His writing was accurate, and the words looked like words.
    When he began to write sentences, he couldn't think of what to write. In the entire lesson, he only wrote one sentence: "I am from Xiashen Street Village, District One, Lin County, Pingyuan Province." He was a little embarrassed to hand in his homework to the teacher. The teacher not only didn't criticize him, but comforted him, "This is finally a sentence. With a little, you don't have to worry about a lot. Write boldly, write whatever you think of, write whatever you see. For example, if you go to the fields and see whose crops are good, how good they are, and why their crops are good, you can write it down." He practiced diligently, wrote diligently, and asked questions diligently. In less than two weeks, he went from being able to write only one sentence to being able to write three or five sentences, being able to write diaries of two or three hundred words, and being able to write simple letters. He happily wrote letters to the teacher, the district chief, and the county chief, wrote letters to his younger brother who was away, and finally wrote a letter of more than 500 words in his best handwriting to Chairman Mao. He described how the landlord's rule in the old society was like a mountain pressing on him; thanked Chairman Mao for leading him to turn over and learn culture; and also expressed his determination to respond to Chairman Mao's call and complete the patriotic production increase plan for 1952.
    Long Zhihong's positive attitude towards learning and production also influenced his wife. In the past, she was unwilling to participate in any village meetings, but now she goes to the meetings. She also happily told others, "He's over forty years old, and he's really diligent. Now he can really read books and newspapers!"
    Long Zhihong and his team members are not satisfied with their existing learning achievements. Recently, the mutual aid team subscribed to "North China People's" as long-term learning material. On Long Zhihong's table, there are often propagandist manuals, Pingyuan Daily, and a small dictionary. This small dictionary was awarded to him by the people's school. He has learned to look up words in the dictionary and accurately remembers which character is in which radical. During one of our chats, I deliberately gave him a difficult problem: I asked him, "Which radical is the 'oppress' (压迫) in?" "The earth radical (土部)," he answered without hesitation. I couldn't help but praise him, "Old Long, you've learned really well!" He said seriously, "It's still far from enough. It's like a child walking. I never learned to crawl, and I'm just learning to walk slowly while holding on to the wall." He suddenly became younger, and as if a curious young man wanted to tell others a secret, he said quietly, "I have a new idea. Let's learn more words, improve our culture, and still want to be able to understand the central party newspaper - People's Daily!"

    速成识字法和农民龙治洪
    力　文
    龙治洪是平原省林县下申街村的一个农业生产互助组的组长，今年四十五岁了。六月初，他和组里的七个青壮年，全部参加了村里的速成识字法学习班。这些天来，他们组里活跃起来了。过去常常是埋头干活，干一晌活谁也不说句话，现在干起活来，你让我讲个生字哪，我让你拼一拼音哪，有说有笑的，活干得又快又好，还不觉累。龙治洪自己说不出是怎样一股高兴劲，可是有一个变化是明显的：过去他好打瞌睡，不大热心参加各种会议，忙一天活，到晚上，他头一挨枕头便呼呼地睡着了；春夏天夜短，每天中午他总要瞌睡一会。现在，他把饭碗一放，便急忙拿起纸笔上民校学习去了；对村上的各种活动也热心了。最近，他们小组还养成了一个新习惯，每天晚上总要聚到一块，学习几个钟头。一天夜里，龙治洪很晚才回家，天不亮，他又点起灯来，给家住山西的弟弟写回信，被他老婆发觉了，老婆又生气又关心地说：“看你这几天，学会写几个生字，连觉也不睡了，累病了，怎么办？”他兴致勃勃地回答：“放心吧，只要心里高兴，保证病不了！”
    是什么东西使得龙治洪劲头儿这么大呢？这是受了一辈子压迫的劳苦人民又一次得到解放（文化解放）的欢乐啊！
    龙治洪只在十一岁那年念过半年书，便跟着老爹逃荒到山西了，爹给地主种地，他放牛羊，从十五岁起，他一直给地主种了二十多年地。解放了，他才返回老家，参加了土地改革运动，分到了土地，从此，他再不受压迫了，生活也改善了。有一个问题却常常使他感到苦闷：他的两个兄弟在山西安家了，常常给他来信，他一次又一次地找民校教员给他看信和写回信，教员工作很忙，他自己也觉得太麻烦人家了。成立了互助组，大家选他当组长，没有文化的苦闷也越来越大，互助组里评工记工，他不会记，报上登着各地互助组的好经验，他满心想看报，报上的字不认得。可是，他也不乐意上民校，他觉得一天认三五个字，一面学一面忘，自己快五十岁了，学到老也学不出个啥出息。他把男孩和女孩都送到小学里读书，老婆说：“女孩家上学中啥用？”他批评她：“你真是老脑筋，半辈子了，我尝够没文化的苦处，社会一天天前进，孩子的前途不能耽搁！”这时候，他没想到自己还能学文化。
    六月五日，民校教员从县里受训回村，带回来一个好消息：用速成识字法，一天能认百多生字，两个半月能学完四册民校课本，能看报，还能写简单的信。龙治洪埋藏在心底的学习文化的要求，一下子触发起来了。他急忙找到村干部说：“不知学习班要不要有四十多岁的人？我很想参加，这样好机会不能错过啊！”村干部告诉他：成年人都可参加学习，只要学到底，准能学好。他老婆不相信一天能学百多字，给他泼“冷水”，她说：“人过三十不学艺，四十多岁了，能学啥，我看办不了事！”龙治洪说：“我学不成大学问，还不能瞧瞧信，看看报啊！”
    速成识字法学习班正式开学了，每天中午歇晌的时间，上两个钟头的课。第一课，龙治洪便愣住了，怎么曲曲拐拐地学起洋文来啦，他感到很不顺劲，嘴又不听使唤，心里一阵发急，发音便越不准了。他正想着向老师要求降到临时班当旁听生，牛老师也看透他的心思，鼓励他：“不要着急，慢慢就学会了。”当冷静下来的时候，他责备着自己：“怎么碰到这点困难，便要打退堂鼓呢？志愿军蔡金桐一个人打退敌人几次冲锋，肠子打断了，他还坚持爬回队伍，自己每天只两个钟头的课，还不能坚持吗？”于是，他向大家宣布了自己的学习公约：“不迟到，不早退，不耽误课，坚持学到底！”
    晚上，他躺在床上一时睡不着，便揣摩起每一个国音字母的字形，一面在身上画着，渐渐熟悉了三十个字母，他想：“不是学不会，不会，是功夫不到。”才迷迷糊糊地睡去了。
    学拼音和突击生字的时候，龙治洪和他的组员们更紧张起来了。单字本和铅笔头成为他们随身携带的两件宝贝，他们见到啥拼啥，走到那里学到那里。几个人在一块锄草，便拼“锄”拼“草”，休息的时候，四面一围，掏出小本，便复习和讲解生字。龙治洪回到家里看到老婆纳鞋底，便拼“针”拼“线”；吃饭的时候，他端着碗也想生字，他从地里学到家，从家又学到“饭市”上，甚至到厕所去的时候，嘴里还念着字母……就这样，他四天时间学会了字母和拼音，十二天时间，便把单字本二千三百多生字全部突击完了。
    接着，他阅读了一、二、三、四册民校课本，宣传员手册，还选读了平原日报上的文章。八月五日，他平生第一次读报，老师给他圈了一篇纪念“八一”节的文章，开始他还有些不相信自己，可是，一字一字读下去，一口气读完了全篇，只有三个生字，他高兴得不知怎样好了，像突然遇见久别的亲人一样，他左右端详着那张报纸，舍不得放开它。
    学习一步步前进，每一步都给龙治洪带来困难，也给他带来更大的兴奋和喜悦。
    动笔写字了，龙治洪拿惯锄头的手，初次拿起笔杆来，发抖得写不下去，写得大的大，小的小，一个字写成两半，怎么也合不到一块。写不到一个钟头，已累得满头大汗了。可是，他没有灰心，十二天学会二千多字的成绩鼓舞着他。他订了一个厚厚的写字本，每天耐心的抄写，七八天功夫，全本已写得满满的，他笔下有准了，字写得像个字样了。
    开始写话了，他提起笔来，想不起写啥好，整整一堂课的时间，只写了一句话：“我是平原省林县一区下申街村人”。他有些不好意思把学习作业交给老师，老师不仅没批评他，反而安慰他：“这总算写成一句话了，有少便不愁多。大胆地写吧，想到啥写啥，见到啥写啥，比如，你下地看到谁的庄稼好，是怎么样好，为啥他的庄稼好，便可把它写出来。”他认真练习，勤写勤问，不到两个星期，从只能写一句话，到会写三五句话，会写二三百字的日记，会写简单的信了。他高兴地给老师、区长、县长写信，给在外的弟弟写信，最后还给毛主席写了端端正正五百多字的一封信。叙述了旧社会地主统治像座大山一样压在他身上；感谢毛主席领导他翻了身，又学习文化；还表示了自己响应毛主席号召，完成一九五二年爱国增产计划的决心。
    龙治洪学习和生产的积极情绪，也影响着他老婆，过去村上开什么会，她都不愿参加，现在开会就到。她还高兴地告诉别人：“人家四十多岁了，真用功哩，现在真的会读书、看报啦！”
    龙治洪和他的组员们，都不满足已有的学习成绩，最近互助组订了一份“华北人民”，作为长期的学习材料。龙治洪家里的桌子上，常摆着宣传员手册、平原日报，还有一本小字典，这本小字典是民校奖给他的，他已学会查字典了，准确地记得什么字在什么部里。在我们一次闲谈的时候，我故意给他出了个难题：我问他：“压迫的压字在那一部？”“土部”他毫不迟疑地回答。我不禁称赞他：“老龙，你学习得真不坏啊！”他认真地说：“还差得远哩，好比小孩走路，我从不会爬，才学到扶着墙慢慢走。”他突然变得年轻起来，像好奇的年轻人要告诉别人一个秘密似地，悄悄地说：“我又有了个新念头，咱再多识些字，提高文化，还想着能看懂中央党报——人民日报哩！”
