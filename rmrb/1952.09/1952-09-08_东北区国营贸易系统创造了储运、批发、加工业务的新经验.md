    Following the exchange and promotion of advanced experiences in warehouse management within the Northeast State-Owned Trading System, new methods and experiences have been created in storage and transportation, wholesale business, processing and ordering business, and leveraging the enthusiasm of staff.

    Storage and transportation work is an important link in commodity circulation. The Northeast Regional Company of China Native Produce Company has recently summarized some good shipping methods. For example, when transporting pigs, the Native Produce Companies of Hailun and Zhaodong counties in Heilongjiang Province adopted the method of separate pen feeding and fixed-quota management. The custodians inspect the pigs at any time and immediately isolate any sick pigs, which greatly reduces pig mortality. When transporting pigs, the Heishan County Native Produce Company in Liaoxi Province tried the "two-layer loading method," that is, laying a layer of wood in the middle of the carriage and loading in two layers, upper and lower, which increased the loading capacity by one time. When Songjiang Province Native Produce Warehouse transported reed mats, they created the method of "standing on four sides, squeezing the seams in the middle" (that is: laying a layer at the bottom, arranging four along and one across in the middle), which allowed each railway car to load four more tons.

    How to improve the wholesale business is an important issue in the current increase production and practice economy campaign of state-owned trading companies. From April to the end of June this year, the Shenyang City Company of China Native Produce Company divided the original comprehensive native produce warehouse into six specialized wholesale warehouses for industrial raw materials, fur and bristles, vegetables and fruits, medicinal materials, aquatic products, and native products. These specialized warehouses have only been established for more than a month, but the wholesale business has been greatly expanded. For example, the comprehensive warehouse used to operate very few types of industrial raw materials and only established supply and marketing relationships with six public and private factories; after the establishment of the industrial raw materials wholesale warehouse, it quickly increased thirty-eight kinds of industrial raw materials and established supply and marketing relationships with more than eighty public and private factories, greatly increasing the total wholesale value. According to statistics, since the establishment of specialized wholesale warehouses, the procurement amount of the Shenyang City Company of China Native Produce Company in July increased by 306 percent compared with the same period last year, and the sales amount increased by 254 percent. At the same time, due to the specialization of the wholesale business, each specialized warehouse has signed supply contracts with many factories, which has strengthened the planning of operations and avoided the occurrence of commodity backlog and unsalable phenomena.

    Entrusting processing and ordering is one of the important methods for the state-owned economy to lead and support private industry and commerce. In order to improve processing work, the Shenyang Regional Wholesale Station of China Department Store Company recently established a processing group and an inspection station. There are a total of 659 private textile factories in Shenyang City that accept processing entrustment from the state. These factories are scattered in various districts, and it is very inconvenient for the department store company's wholesale station to contact them separately. In April of this year, after consultation with these factories, the wholesale station established sixteen processing groups according to the regions, with the group leader responsible for uniformly contacting the department store company's wholesale station for processing business. All contract signing and raw material collection are carried out by groups. The department store company's wholesale station also set up inspection stations in the location of each group, and sent inspectors to be responsible for checking the finished product specifications, delivery dates, etc. After the implementation of this method, the procedures for entrusting processing have been simplified, work efficiency has been improved, and the wholesale station can conduct universal inspections of various processing factories through the processing groups to ensure the implementation of processing contracts.

    The Shenyang City Company of China Industrial Equipment Company has adopted another method to strengthen processing work. Because the company itself has insufficient manpower, from May onwards, it has entrusted the industry and commerce sections of the people's governments of various districts to designate special personnel to serve as inspectors. These inspectors, according to the contracts signed by the industrial equipment company and private factories, compile the various processing factories in their respective districts into several groups, and inspect them by group. In addition to urging and encouraging the factories to fulfill the contracts on time, they also understand the problems existing in the production process of each factory and report them to the industrial equipment company in a timely manner for resolution.

    In order to give play to the enthusiasm of staff and better carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign, in July, the Shenyang City Company of China Department Store Company piloted an excess reward system in six groups, including the clothing group of the Second Store. Taking the group as a unit, the average number of transactions, transaction amount, and business hours per person per day were calculated based on the past business situation of each group, and then the workload per person per day was determined. If the salesperson over-fulfills the workload, they are rewarded according to the excess reward rate. This strengthens the salesperson's sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for work. For example, when a salesperson in the clothing group saw that single-bed sheets sold well, they changed the long-stocked checkered double-bed sheets into single-bed sheets, and sold thirty-five of them in a month. Because the work efficiency of the salespersons has been improved, the six groups have increased production and saved wealth equivalent to more than ten tons of grain for the country in one month.

### 东北区国营贸易系统创造了储运、批发、加工业务的新经验

    东北区国营贸易系统创造了储运、批发、加工业务的新经验
    东北国营贸易系统交流和推广了仓库保管方面的先进经验以后，又在储运、批发业务、加工定货业务以及发挥工作人员的积极性等方面，创造了一些新的办法和经验。
    储运工作是商品流转中的一个重要环节，中国土产公司东北区公司最近总结了一些好的装运法。例如黑龙江省的海伦、肇东两县土产公司在运猪的时候，采取了分圈饲养、定额保管的方法，由保管员随时进行检查，发现病猪，立即加以隔离，这样就大大减少了猪的死亡。辽西省黑山县土产公司运猪的时候试用“两层装载法”，即在车厢中间铺一层木板，分上下两层装载，这样就使装载量提高了一倍。松江省土产货栈装运苇席时，创造了“四面立装，中间挤缝”的方法（即：底铺一层，中间排成四顺一横），使每个车皮多装了四吨。
    怎样改进批发业务，这是目前国营贸易公司开展增产节约运动中的一个重要问题。中国土产公司沈阳市公司从今年四月起到六月底止，将原来综合性的土产货栈，分成工业原料、皮毛鬃尾、蔬菜水果、药材、水产和土产六个专业性的批发货栈。这些专业性的货栈成立到现在仅一个多月，批发业务已大大扩展。例如过去综合性货栈经营的工业原料种类很少，只和六家公私营工厂建立供销关系；工业原料批发货栈成立后，很快就增加了三十八种工业原料，和八十多家公私工厂建立了供销关系，批发总值大大提高。据统计，中国土产公司沈阳市公司自成立专业批发货栈后，七月份的采购额比去年同期增加了百分之三百零六，销售额增加了百分之二百五十四。同时，由于批发业务专业化，各专业货栈和许多工厂订立了供应合同，这样就加强了经营的计划性，避免了商品积压和滞销现象的发生。
    委托加工、定货，是国营经济领导和扶植私营工商业的重要方法之一。中国百货公司沈阳地区批发站为了改进加工工作，最近成立了加工组和检查站。沈阳市接受国家加工委托的私营纺织厂共有六百五十九家，这些工厂分散各区，百货公司批发站和他们分别联系很不方便。今年四月，批发站和这些工厂协商以后，按地区成立了十六个加工小组，由小组长负责统一向百货公司批发站接洽加工业务，凡签订合同、领取原料等都以小组为单位。百货公司批发站又在每一个小组的所在地设立检查站，派检查员负责检查成品规格、交货日期等。这个方法实行以后，简化了委托加工的手续，提高了工作效率，而且批发站可以通过加工小组对各加工厂实行普遍检查，保证加工合同的执行。
    中国工业器材公司沈阳市公司采取了另一种方法来加强加工工作。该公司因本身人力不足，从五月份起，委托各区人民政府工商科指定专人担任检查员，这些检查员根据工业器材公司和私营工厂所订的合同，将本区内的各加工工厂编成若干小组，按组检查，除了督促和鼓励各厂按期履行合同外，并了解各厂在生产过程中所存在的问题，及时地报告工业器材公司予以解决。
    为了发挥工作人员的积极性，更好地开展增产节约运动，中国百货公司沈阳市公司七月份在第二商店服装组等六个小组中试行超额奖励制。以小组为单位，根据各组过去营业情况计算出每人每日平均交易次数、交易额和营业时间，然后定出每人每日的工作量，营业员超额完成工作量，就按超额奖励率予以奖励，这就加强了营业员的工作责任心和积极性，如服装组营业员看到单人床被单销路好，就将积压很久的方格双人床被单改成单人床被单，一个月中就卖出三十五条。由于营业员的工作效率提高，六个小组在一个月内就为国家增产节约了价值相当于十吨多粮食的财富。　（新华社）
