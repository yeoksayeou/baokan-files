The draft instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union stipulate a significant increase in the harvest of wheat, rice, cotton, and other crops in Transcaucasia.

Scientists in several republics of Transcaucasia are vigorously helping collective farmers to further develop agriculture. For example, Azerbaijan's seedling growers recently developed seventeen new high-yielding wheat varieties.

By the end of 1955, these varieties will be adopted by many collective farms. In the near future, collective farms will receive one thousand tons of new varieties. New varieties of industrial crops are also being developed, and in the coming years, these varieties will be widely used in Azerbaijan's agriculture.

Armenian economists are helping collective farmers draft five-year plans for the development of their farms. For example, the collective farm named "Twenty-Six Commissars" in Ashtarak District, working according to such a long-term plan, has achieved remarkable results. Based on scientists' advice, this collective farm opened an orchard and greatly expanded poultry and pig breeding operations. It adopted a ten-crop rotation system. The farmers of this collective farm expect that by 1955, the average harvest will double.

    苏联外高加索农业科学家帮助集体农民发展农业
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示草案规定大大增加外高加索的小麦、大米、棉花及其他农作物的收获量。
    外高加索几个共和国的科学家正在大力帮助集体农民进一步发展农业。例如，阿塞拜疆的植苗者最近发展了十七种新小麦丰产品种。
    到一九五五年底，这些品种将为许多集体农场采用。在最近的将来，集体农场将得到一千吨新品种。工业作物的新品种也正在发展，在未来数年中，这些品种将广泛地用于阿塞拜疆的农业。
    亚美尼亚的经济学家在帮助集体农民草拟发展他们的农场的五年计划。例如，阿什塔拉克区以“二十六人民委员”为名的集体农场按照这样的长期计划工作，已经获得了显著成就。根据科学家的意见，这个集体农场开辟了一个果园，并大大扩充了家禽和猪的饲养工作。它采用了十种作物轮种制。这个集体农场的农民预计，到一九五五年，平均收获量将增加一倍。
