    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 21st: Despite the worldwide condemnation of the people, the American aggressors continue to use chemical weapons in a planned manner on the Korean front. According to statistics from July and August, the enemy fired poison gas shells at our forward positions a total of ten times, including five times on the western front, four times on the central front, and one time on the eastern front. When using these poison gas shells, the American aggressor troops fired them together with many ordinary shells. Most of these poison gas shells are asphyxiating poison gas shells. For example, at 11:00 on July 6th, the enemy fired seven shells at our 155.7 high ground on the western front with heavy howitzers, two of which were poison gas shells.
    The Korean and Chinese People's Armies are extremely angry at the enemy's continued use of poison gas, and they are determined to defeat the enemy's chemical warfare with the victorious confidence of defeating the American aggressor army's bacteriological warfare.

    美军继续使用毒气弹
    激起朝中人民军队极大愤怒
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】美国侵略者不顾全世界人民愤怒谴责，继续在朝鲜前线有计划地使用化学武器。据七、八两个月的统计，敌军共向我前沿阵地投射毒气弹十次，其中有五次在西线，四次在中线，一次在东线。美国侵略军使用这些毒气弹时，是与许多普通炮弹一齐发射的。这些毒气弹大部分是窒息性毒气弹。如七月六日十一时，敌军以重榴弹炮向西线我军一五五点七高地发射七发炮弹，其中即有两发是毒气弹。
    朝中人民军队为敌人继续使用毒气弹的罪行激起极大的愤怒，他们决以打败美国侵略军细菌战的胜利信心来打败敌人的化学战。
