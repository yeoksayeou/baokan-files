Xinhua News Agency, September 18th:

    The spokesperson for the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference issued the following statement on September 17th regarding the refusal by the governments of the United States, Japan, and Australia to issue passports to representatives from their respective countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference:

    The convocation of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has been warmly supported by people all over the world. Representatives from various countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions have been elected to participate in the Peace Conference, and the representatives from most countries have already arrived in Beijing or are on their way to Beijing. However, the governments of the United States, Japan, and Australia have refused to issue exit passports to peace representatives from their respective countries. The colleagues of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the representatives from various countries who have already arrived in Beijing are extremely surprised by this. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is being convened based on the resolutions of the June preparatory meeting. As the world knows, it aims to discuss issues related to the peace and security, national independence, economic exchange, and cultural exchange of the people in the Asian and Pacific Regions. This noble purpose is completely in line with the wishes and demands of all good people in the Asian and Pacific Regions and the world, and it is also completely in line with the wishes and demands of the people of the United States, Japan, and Australia. We do not understand why the governments of the United States, Japan, and Australia are so afraid of their own people attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to discuss the aforementioned issues of peace; why their actions are so contrary to the good wishes of their own people. We believe that the governments of the United States, Japan, and Australia have no reason to refuse or delay issuing exit passports to peace representatives from their countries. We hope that the governments of the United States, Japan, and Australia, like other governments, can promptly issue exit passports to their own peace representatives. We express our warm sympathy and support for the efforts of the people of the United States, Japan, and Australia to obtain exit passports to participate in the Peace Conference.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会发言人
    就美日澳政府拒发代表护照事发表谈话
    【新华社十八日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会发言人十七日就美国、日本和澳大利亚等国政府拒绝发护照给出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各该国代表事，发表谈话如下：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，受到了全世界人民的热烈拥护，亚洲及太平洋区域各国参加和平会议的代表，早已纷纷选出，多数国家的代表业已来到北京，或正在来北京的途中。但美国、日本和澳大利亚等国政府竟拒不发给各该国和平代表以出国护照。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会的同人和已经到达北京的各国代表们，对此感到异常诧异。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议乃是根据六月筹备会议的决议召开的，举世共知，它所要讨论的乃是有关亚洲及太平洋区域人民和平安全、民族独立、经济交流和文化交流等问题，这种崇高的目的是完全符合于亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界所有善良人民的意愿和要求的，同样也是完全符合于美国、日本和澳大利亚等国人民的意愿和要求的；而美国、日本和澳大利亚等国政府，竟然拒绝或拖延发给本国和平代表的出国护照，我们不知道为什么他们竟这样畏惧他们本国人民出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议讨论上述和平等问题；为什么他们的行为竟和他们本国人民的善良愿望这样背道而驰。我们认为美国、日本和澳大利亚等国政府是没有任何理由拒绝或拖延发给他们国内人民的和平代表以出国护照的。我们希望美国、日本和澳大利亚等国政府能够和其他各国政府一样，迅速发给他们本国和平代表以出国护照。我们对于美国、日本和澳大利亚人民为参加和平会议而争取出国护照的努力，表示热烈的同情和支持。
