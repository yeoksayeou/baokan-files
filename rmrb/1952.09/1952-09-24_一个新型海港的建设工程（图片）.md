The construction project of a new type of seaport

    Tanggu New Port is a new type of seaport under construction. The transportation behind the new port can reach the five provinces of North China and Rehe, Gansu, Ningxia, as well as northern Shandong, northern Shaanxi, and western Inner Mongolia, with a hinterland area of 2 million square kilometers, which will continue to develop in the future. Its hinterland area is likely to increase to 4.5 million square kilometers, and the population will be over 100 million. Therefore, the new port will not only become the main import and export port of North China, but also has great significance for the exchange of materials between the North and the South and the development of international trade.

    In August 1951, the State Council of the Central People's Government approved the establishment of the Tanggu Port Construction Committee, deciding to enable 10,000-ton ships to sail into the new port for berthing, loading and unloading by the end of 1952 under the strong leadership of the Central Government. The employees of the new port are carrying out a patriotic port construction, labor-saving and cost-saving competition, and are full of confidence to complete this glorious task ahead of schedule.

    The Tanggu New Port, which is under construction, is located on the north bank of the Dagu Estuary of the Hai River, near Tanggu, about 50 kilometers from Tianjin. It will become the deep-water outer port of Tianjin, the economic center of North China. In August last year, the State Council of the Central People's Government decided to vigorously build the new port. After the efforts of the port construction workers, the first phase of the project will be completed by the end of 1952, and 10,000-ton ships will be able to dock and load and unload goods here. This is a panoramic view of Tanggu New Port. Dredgers are working.

    The port construction project is implemented on the basis of careful design and economic accounting system, which not only reduces the project cost, but also ensures the project quality. This is the situation of the administrative负责人 (responsible person) and some technical personnel of Tanggu New Port studying the port construction project plan.

    Divers take electric arc cutting knives into the sea to repair dock work.

    There are various types of dredgers in the dredging work that undertakes the main task of port construction. This is the Dagu No. 1 dredger, and the crew members are checking the mud buckets.

    Vigorously carrying out dredging work on the new port channel and near the wharf is the main task of the first stage of the Tanggu New Port construction project. This is Wang Jinzeng (left), the captain of the Tanggu No. 9 electric suction and lifting dredger, and Zhao Guoqing, the boatswain, are studying the dredging work on the dredger.

    This is the newly repaired electric coal loading machine in the new port, which is more than 50% more efficient than before liberation. Now it can load 450 tons of coal per hour.

    The 850-horsepower electric suction and lifting dredger has now created a record of 632 cubic meters of mud per hour. This is the workers checking the floating pontoon sludge discharge pipe used to ensure safe sludge discharge.

    Rationalization proposals and the creation of new record movements have become the main contents of the patriotic port construction, labor-saving and cost-saving competition, which ensures the continuous improvement of technical level and project quality. This is the workers of No. 1 wharf of the new port taking advantage of their rest time to study the problem of using electric welding machine and oxygen in combination.

    一个新型海港的建设工程
    塘沽新港是一个正在建设中的新型海港。新港后方交通可遍达华北五省和热河、甘肃、宁夏以及鲁北、陕北、内蒙西部等，腹地面积达二百万平方公里，将来还会继续发展。它的腹地面积将有可能增至四百五十万平方公里，人口将在一亿以上。因此新港不仅将成为华北主要的吞吐口，而且对于南北物资交流及发展国际贸易有着重大的意义。
    中央人民政府政务院于一九五一年八月通过成立塘沽建港委员会，决定在中央强有力的领导下，使万吨轮船在一九五二年底能够驶入新港停泊装卸。新港的职工同志们正在开展着爱国建港劳动节约竞赛运动，满怀信心地提前来完成这个光荣的任务。
    正在建设中的塘沽新港，在海河大沽口北岸，距天津五十公里左右的塘沽附近，它将成为华北的经济中心——天津市的深水外港。去年八月，中央人民政府政务院决定大力修建新港，经过建港职工们的努力，第一期工程将在一九五二年年底完成，万吨的轮船就可以在这里停靠码头和装卸货物了。这是塘沽新港的全景。挖泥船正在进行工作。
    修建中的第一号码头。
    建港工程是在周密的设计和经济核算制的基础上实施的，因此不仅降低了工程成本，而且也保证了工程质量。这是塘沽新港的行政负责人及部分技术人员正在研究建港工程计划的情形。
    潜水员携带电孤割刀入海进行修理码头工作。
    在担负建港工程主要任务的挖泥工作中，有各式各样的挖泥船。这是大沽一号挖泥船，船员们正在检查泥斗。
    大力进行新港航道和码头附近的挖泥工作，是塘沽新港修建工程的第一阶段的主要任务。这是塘沽九号电动吸扬式挖泥船船长王金增（左）和水手长赵国卿正在挖泥船上研究挖泥工作。
    这是新港新修复的电动装煤机，它的效率超过解放前百分之五十以上，现在每小时可装煤四百五十吨。
    八百五十匹马力的电动吸扬式挖泥船，现在创造了每小时挖泥六百三十二立方公尺的记录。这是工人们正在检查使用的浮筒排泥管，保证安全排泥。
    合理化建议和创造新纪录运动，成为爱国建港劳动节约竞赛运动的主要内容，它保证了技术水平和工程质量的不断提高。这是新港第一号码头的工人利用休息时间，正在钻研用电焊机和氧气配合的问题。
