Introducing the "Learning Translation Series"
    Ding Shouhe

　　"Learning Translation Series" is a publication that translates and publishes important theoretical works on Marxism-Leninism from Soviet newspapers and periodicals. It was launched in February of last year and has now published thirteen issues. This publication mainly introduces important papers published in the Soviet Communist Party's official newspapers and periodicals "Pravda" and "Bolshevik," the "Philosophical Problems" of the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the "Economic Problems" of the Institute of Economics, and other Soviet newspapers and periodicals. It also selects some classic works of Marxism-Leninism (already translated and published Stalin's "The Russian Social Democratic Party and Its Immediate Tasks" and "Concerning the Questions of Strategy and Tactics of the Russian Communists").

　　Since its publication, this publication has increasingly attracted the attention of a wide readership with its rich content. From its first to sixth issues last year, it systematically published articles on how to teach "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." These articles not only provided good teaching methods and experiences for teaching the classic work of the Marxist-Leninist encyclopedia, the History of the CPSU (B) Short Course, but also served as study outlines for general readers. (To meet the needs of readers, it was compiled into a book and has now been published in two editions.)

    Since the publication of Stalin's brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," various scientific departments in the Soviet Union have been seriously studying the various new principles and conclusions about dialectical materialism and historical materialism proposed by Stalin. Prominent Soviet scientists and scholars have written many valuable papers based on this outstanding work. "Learning Translation Series" selected and published several of these, among which Dr. Yudin's "The Significance of Stalin's Writings on Linguistics for the Development of Social Science" is the most popular among our readers (People's Publishing House has published a separate edition). Yudin's paper not only introduced Stalin's great discoveries in linguistics, but also provided a full explanation and elaboration of a series of important issues in social science raised by Stalin in a new way, especially the issue of the base and superstructure, and the laws of development of socialist society. It also provided a clear explanation of the role of literature and art in social development and how to treat the old heritage. Other articles, such as "Comrade Stalin on the Role of the Superstructure in Social Development," "The Position and Role of Philosophy in Social Life," and "The Significance of Stalin's Writings on Linguistics for the Development of Social Science," are all very valuable.

　　After the publication of Chairman Mao's great philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," they caused a huge impact at home and abroad. Currently, a large-scale movement to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is being carried out throughout the country, and "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" are being studied first to grasp Mao Zedong's way of thinking. In this regard, "Learning Translation Series" specially introduced "The Role of Practice in the Process of Cognition," "The Struggle of Opposites," "On the Importance of the Specificity of Cognitive Phenomena," "On the Leaps in the Development of Nature and Society," and Chapter 5 "Development as the Struggle of Opposites" from the book "Marxist Dialectics" by the famous Soviet philosopher Rosenthal, to help everyone learn. Rosenthal's book provides a complete analysis of the "core" of Marxist dialectics, that is, the law of contradiction (or the law of the unity of opposites). He uses many facts from physics, biology, Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity, and other natural fields to illustrate that internal contradictions and the struggle of opposites are the source of the development of things. In addition, the journal has continuously published explanations of many important terms from the newly compiled "Concise Dictionary of Philosophy" by Yudin and Rosenthal, such as "Worldview," "Reflection Theory," "The Criterion of Truth," "Eternal Truth," "Objective Truth," "Relative Truth," "Absolute Truth," "Leap," "Antagonistic and Non-Antagonistic Contradictions," etc., which are important reference materials for studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction."

　　As the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements victoriously conclude and large-scale economic construction is about to begin, the whole country is in more urgent need of learning from the advanced experience of Soviet economic construction. Therefore, introducing works on Soviet economic construction has become an important task for the publishing industry. "Learning Translation Series" has begun its work in this area. For example, "The Bolshevik Principles and Methods of Socialist Industrial Management," "Economic Accounting is a Socialist Management Method," and "On the Relationship between Economy and Politics" that it has published are all very important articles.

　　In the published "Learning Translation Series," several articles on communist morality have also been published. What deserves special mention here is Kak's "Ethical Problems of the Marxist-Leninist Worldview." Kak's paper provides a profound discussion of communist morality. He pointed out that communist morality is first manifested in the public interest being higher than individual interests, and individuals should consciously serve the people. Everyone should regard the cause of the people as their own, and not vice versa, pretending that personal affairs are the affairs of the people. Communist morality requires everyone to love the motherland, be loyal and honest to the country, strictly keep state secrets, be vigilant against all enemy conspiracies, and condemn all attempts to deceive the country with lies. In the new society, there must be new moral standards in people's relationships, mutual assistance, and principledness. In addition, he carried out a merciless criticism of the remnants of capitalist ideology among those who were confused by "personal interests," such as evading labor, violating labor discipline and state discipline, private emotional entanglements, flattery, suppressing criticism, sheltering, and unprincipledness.

　　This article was published during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" periods. Some cadres and university students read it carefully and launched discussions in connection with their own ideological reality.

　　It should also be mentioned that "Learning Translation Series" is also a beneficial publication for the scientific and academic circles in our country. For example, "Science is a Social Ideology," "The Position and Role of Science in Social Development," "The Origin of the Earth and Planets," "Summary of the Discussion on Logical Problems," "Opposing 'Physical' Idealist Variants—Modern 'Energeticism,'" etc., are all valuable scientific works. In the article "Science is a Social Ideology," the author pointed out: Science is the general spiritual product of social development and a system of objective knowledge about nature, society, and thinking that has been tested and proven by practice. The purpose of science is not simply to reflect the objective world, but also to strive to help people gain control over the spontaneous forces of nature and human society through understanding the internal laws of the development of nature and human society. In addition, the author made a brilliant and insightful analysis of the characteristics and laws of development of natural science and social science, as well as their relationship with the base and superstructure. Regarding natural science, the author said that it is directly related to production rather than the base, and therefore it is not a superstructure, and it itself has no class nature. However, natural scientists are different. They are always subject to the control of philosophy and serve a certain class. So-called supra-class natural scientists are actually non-existent, only self-deception.

　　"Learning Translation Series" has recently begun to select and publish papers on party building. For example, the seventh issue published Slepoff's "On the Bolshevik Style in Party Work" and the "Bolshevik" magazine's editorial "To Continuously Improve the Work of Selecting and Allocating Cadres." Slepoff's article provides a comprehensive and profound analysis of the working style of Bolshevik leaders. He pointed out that the combination of revolutionary courage and a pragmatic spirit, a high degree of principle, strict criticism and self-criticism, a keen sense and foresight for fresh things, constant concern for the people, timely handling of letters from the masses, and the ability to discover general fundamental problems from letters from the masses are important features of the Bolshevik working style. When talking about how to maintain the Bolshevik working style, the author pointed out that studying theory and party history and expanding one's ideological and cultural horizons are necessary conditions for mastering the working style of Lenin and Stalin. Without rich knowledge and the ability to analyze historical, philosophical, and economic problems, as well as specialized problems related to practical work, there is no way to talk about genuine Bolshevik leadership.

　　According to the feedback from many readers, they constantly read and study each issue carefully, and have gained a lot of theoretical knowledge, greatly improving their level of understanding. Therefore, this publication is indeed a good publication worth recommending to a wide readership.

    介绍“学习译丛”
    丁守和
　　“学习译丛”是译载苏联报刊有关马克思列宁主义重要理论著作的一个刊物，于去年二月创刊，现已出版十三期。这个刊物主要介绍苏联共产党的机关报刊“真理报”、“布尔什维克”，苏联科学院哲学研究所的“哲学问题”，经济研究所的“经济问题”以及其他苏联报刊所登载的重要论文，同时选载一些马克思列宁主义经典著作（已经译载了斯大林的“俄国社会民主党及其最近的任务”和“论俄国共产党人的战略与策略问题”两文）。
　　这个刊物出版以来，即以其丰富的内容日益引起广大读者的注意。它自去年的一至六期曾系统地刊载了如何讲授“联共（布）党史简明教程”的文章，这些文章不仅对讲授联共党史这一马克思列宁主义百科全书的经典著作提供了良好的教学法和经验，而且也是一般阅读者的学习提纲。（为满足读者的要求，曾汇集成册，现已出了两版。）
    自斯大林的天才著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”发表以后，苏联各科学部门都在认真地研究斯大林所提出的关于辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的各种新的原理和结论，苏联著名的科学家、学者并根据这一杰出著作写了许多有价值的论文。“学习译丛”选载了若干篇，其中以尤金博士的“斯大林关于语言学问题的著作对于社会科学发展的意义”一文最受我国读者的欢迎（人民出版社已出了单行本）。尤金的论文不但对斯大林在语言学问题上的伟大发现作了介绍，而且对斯大林以新的方式所提出的关于社会科学中一系列的重要的问题，特别是基础与上层建筑的问题，社会主义社会的发展规律问题，作了充分的说明和发挥。对于文学和艺术在社会发展中的作用以及如何对待旧遗产的问题，也作了清楚的解释。其他文章，如“斯大林同志论上层建筑在社会发展中的作用”，“哲学在社会生活中的地位和作用”，“斯大林关于语言学问题的著作对于社会科学发展的意义”等，都是很有价值的。　　毛主席的伟大哲学著作“实践论”、“矛盾论”发表后，在国外国内都引起了巨大的影响。目前全国正开展一个学习“毛泽东选集”的大运动，并首先研究“实践论”、“矛盾论”来掌握毛泽东的思想方法。“学习译丛”在这方面特介绍了“实践在认识过程中的作用”，“对立面的斗争”，“论认识现象特殊性的重要”，“论自然界与社会发展中的飞跃形式”，以及苏联著名哲学家罗森塔尔著的“马克思主义辩证法”一书的第五章“发展即对立的斗争”等文，以帮助大家学习。罗森塔尔的著作，对于马克思主义辩证法的“核心”，即矛盾法则（或对立统一法则），作了完整的分析。他用物理学、生物学、巴甫洛夫的高级神经活动学说以及其他自然领域中的许多事实，说明了内部矛盾、对立的斗争是事物发展的源泉。另外，该刊还连续地刊载了尤金、罗森塔尔新编“简明哲学辞典”中的许多重要名辞解释，如“世界观”，“反映论”，“真理的标准”，“永恒真理”，“客观真理”，“相对真理”，“绝对真理”，“飞跃”，“对抗性的与非对抗性的矛盾”等等，都是学习“实践论”“矛盾论”的重要参考资料。　　当着“三反”“五反”运动胜利结束与大规模经济建设即将开始的时候，全国都更加迫切需要学习苏联经济建设的先进经验，因此介绍苏联经济建设的论著，就成为出版界的重要任务了。“学习译丛”在这方面已开始了它的工作，如它所刊载的“社会主义工业管理的布尔什维克原则和方法”，“经济核算是社会主义的经营方法”，“论经济与政治的相互关系”等都是很重要的文章。
　　在已出版的“学习译丛”中，还发表了几篇关于共产主义道德的文章，在这里值得特别指出的，是卡克的“马克思列宁主义世界观的伦理学问题”。卡克的论文对于共产主义道德作了深刻的论述。他指出，共产主义道德首先表现在公共利益高于个人利益，个人应该自觉地为人民服务。每个人都应该把人民的事业当作个人的事业，而不应该相反地把个人的事业冒充人民的事业。共产主义道德要求每个人热爱祖国，对国家忠诚老实，严格保守国家秘密，警惕敌人的一切阴谋，谴责一切以谎言欺骗国家的企图。在新社会里，在人们相互关系中要有新的道德标准，要互相帮助，要有原则性。此外，对于为“个人利益”所迷惑的人们，对于逃避劳动、违犯劳动纪律和国家纪律、私人感情拉拢、吹牛拍马、压制批评、庇护、无原则等等资本主义思想残余，并进行了无情的批判。　　这篇文章发表于“三反”“五反”期间，某些机关干部和大学员生曾认真予以阅读，并联系自己思想实际展开讨论。　　还应当提到，“学习译丛”对我国科学界、学术界也是一个有益的刊物。如它刊载的“科学是一种社会意识形态”，“科学在社会发展中的地位和作用”，“地球和行星起源问题”，“逻辑问题讨论总结”，“反对‘物理学的’唯心论变种——现代‘唯能论’”等等，都是很有价值的科学著作。在“科学是一种社会意识形态”一文中，作者指出：科学是社会发展的普遍的精神产物，是被实践检验和证明过的关于自然、社会和思惟的客观知识的体系。科学的目的不单纯是反映客观世界，而且它力求通过对自然界和人类社会发展的内部规律的认识，以帮助人们取得对自然界和人类社会的自发力量的统治。另外，作者对自然科学和社会科学的特征、发展规律以及它们和基础和上层建筑的关系，作了精湛透辟的分析。如关于自然科学，作者说，它不是和基础而是和生产直接联系，因而它不是上层建筑，其本身是没有阶级性的。但是自然科学家则不然，他们总要受哲学的支配，为一定的阶级服务，所谓超阶级的自然科学家实际是没有的，仅不过是自欺欺人而已。　　“学习译丛”最近已开始选载党的建设方面的论文，如第七期刊出了斯列波夫的“论党工作中的布尔什维克作风”和“布尔什维克”杂志的社论“要不断改进挑选和配备干部的工作”两篇文章。斯列波夫的文章对布尔什维克领导者的工作作风作了全面深刻的分析，他指出革命魄力和求实精神的结合、高度的原则性、严格的批评和自我批评、对新鲜事物锐敏的感觉和预见性、经常关心人民、及时处理群众来信、善于从群众来信中发现一般性的根本问题等，是布尔什维克工作作风的重要特点。作者在谈到如何保持布尔什维克作风时指出，研究理论和党史，扩大自己的思想和文化的视野，是掌握列宁斯大林工作作风的必备条件。没有丰富的知识，不善于分析历史、哲学和经济问题以及和实际工作相联系的专门问题，便根本谈不上真正的布尔什维克的领导。　　根据很多读者反映，他们不断认真阅读研究每期文章，获得了很多理论知识，大大提高了自己的认识水平。因此，这个刊物确是一个值得向广大读者推荐的好刊物。
