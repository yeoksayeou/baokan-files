Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued instructions requiring agricultural leading organs in all localities to strengthen guidance to farmers on wheat cultivation techniques, based on the basic content of the "Winter Wheat High-Yield Technology Trial Outline" (see page 2 of this newspaper tomorrow) formulated by the Central Ministry of Agriculture, combined with local conditions, to achieve a general increase in wheat yield per unit area. The full text of the instructions is as follows:
    In the past two years, many high-yield wheat examples have emerged across the country. Not only have small high-yield areas achieved high yields, but also many regions have seen examples of farms, teams, cooperatives, villages, and counties universally achieving high yields. For example, the Laiwu Farm in Shandong Province harvested 915 jin of wheat per mu on irrigated land; the Weimingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, harvested a maximum of 732 jin of wheat per mu on dry land; the Jinlaojia Village in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, harvested an average of 375 jin of wheat per mu on dry land for the entire village; and Wugong County in Shaanxi Province harvested an average of 200 jin per mu for the entire county. The unit area yield of these high-yield examples exceeds the national average wheat yield by two to even eight or nine times. These large-scale high yields powerfully indicate that the potential for increasing wheat production in our country is very strong. The yields of high-yield examples far exceed the national average yield, confirming that improving wheat cultivation techniques, reasonably implementing a series of effective measures to increase yield, such as deep plowing and moisture conservation, close planting, increased fertilizer application, selection of superior varieties, appropriate irrigation, and prevention and control of pests and diseases—that is, summarizing and promoting the technical experience of high-yield models, and changing conservative and unreasonable farming methods—is the only correct way to unleash the potential for increasing wheat production. Therefore, strengthening guidance on wheat high-yield technology is currently the most important key to solving the problem of increasing wheat production.
    After several years of production recovery and development, the broad masses of farmers are very eager to improve production techniques; in particular, the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations provides a superior organizational guarantee for the improvement of production techniques. Agricultural leading organs in all localities must fully value and utilize the favorable conditions for improving production techniques, and earnestly and concretely guide the masses of farmers to improve wheat cultivation techniques. We are now analyzing and summarizing the technical experience of high-yield models in various places and have formulated the "Winter Wheat High-Yield Technology Trial Outline" for distribution to various places for research and trial implementation. Given the vastness of China's wheat-producing areas and the different natural conditions such as climate and soil in each place, all localities must, based on the basic content of this outline, combine it with local conditions to formulate specific wheat cultivation plans, and use various methods to widely and deeply publicize it, so that it is known to every household and universally implemented, and the general wheat yield in the local area is generally increased. Only in this way can the patriotic wheat production increase campaign be effectively launched, and the task of increasing wheat production by 15% to 20% in 1953 can be guaranteed.

    指示各地加强小麦栽培技术的指导工作
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府农业部发出指示，要求全国各地农业领导机关根据中央农业部制订的“冬小麦丰产技术试行纲要”（见本报明日第二版）的基本内容，结合当地具体情况，加强对农民进行小麦栽培技术的指导工作，以达到普遍提高小麦单位面积产量。指示全文如下：
    近两年来，全国各地出现了很多小麦丰产典型，不仅是小块丰产地达到高额产量，更有不少地区出现了全农场、全组、全社、全村、全县普遍达到丰产的事例。例如：山东省莱芜农场每亩水地小麦收九百一十五斤，山西省武乡县魏明标农业生产合作社旱地小麦每亩最高收到七百三十二斤，河南省项城县靳老家村旱地小麦全村平均每亩收三百七十五斤，陕西省武功县全县平均每亩收二百斤。这些丰产典型的单位面积产量，超过全国小麦平均产量二倍甚至八、九倍。这些大面积丰产的获得，有力地指明了我国小麦增产的潜在能力是非常雄厚的。丰产典型的产量远远超过全国平均产量，证实了改进小麦栽培技术，合理地实行深耕保墒、密植、增施肥料、选用良种、适当灌溉、防治病虫害等一系列提高产量的有效措施，即总结与推广丰产模范的技术经验，改变保守的不合理的耕作方法，是发挥小麦增产潜力的唯一正确的途径。因此，加强小麦丰产技术的指导工作，是目前解决小麦增产问题的最主要的关键。
    广大农民经过几年来生产的恢复与发展，对于改进生产技术的要求已十分迫切；特别是互助合作组织的发展，更使生产技术的改进工作有了优越的组织保证。各地农业领导机关必须充分重视和运用改进生产技术的有利条件，认真地具体地指导农民群众改进小麦栽培技术。现特根据各地丰产模范技术经验，加以分析总结，制订“冬小麦丰产技术试行纲要”，分发各地研究试行。鉴于我国小麦产区辽阔，气候土壤等自然条件各有不同，各地必须根据这个纲要的基本内容，结合当地具体情况，作出小麦栽培具体计划，运用多种方式，广泛地深入地进行宣传，作到家喻户晓，普遍执行，把当地小麦一般产量普遍提高。只有如此，小麦爱国增产竞赛运动才能有力地开展，一九五三年增产小麦百分之十五至二十的任务才能保证完成。
