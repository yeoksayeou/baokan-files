Since factories and mines across the country enthusiastically launched the patriotic production increase and economy campaign on the solid foundation of the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, they have achieved significant results. However, due to the one-sided emphasis on production tasks and neglect of safety by the leading personnel of some factories and mines, casualty accidents have recently continued to occur, affecting the normal development of the production increase and economy campaign. This must be seriously corrected.

Based on the analysis of some accident cases recently handled by this committee and local supervision committees: The serious purely task-oriented viewpoint of leading personnel in some factories and mines is an important reason for causing casualty accidents. Under slogans such as "in order to complete production tasks" and "in order to implement economic accounting system," they can limitlessly increase workers' labor intensity, extend working hours, and even encourage workers to "brave the heat and flames." For example, at the Majiagou Brick Factory in Kailuan, the work was not grasped tightly beforehand, and production could not be completed according to plan. In order not to miss the contract deadline and avoid fines, factory director Zhao Ming, deputy factory director Hu Maoxiang, and others, knowing that the temperature inside the kiln was above 130 degrees Celsius, mobilized workers to take bricks from the hot kiln. Zhao Ming and Hu Maoxiang also jointly wrote letters and sent tea to the workers, encouraging them to "continue to display this great patriotic enthusiasm" in the future. The trade union cadres not only turned a blind eye but also wrote a rhythmic doggerel: "Out of the hot kiln, onto the front line, every hero works hard," to encourage them. As a result, 41 of the 43 workers were burned, and some were almost burned to death. Another example is the Yingfeng Coal Mine in Henan, which was operated by feudal foremen. The leadership's thinking only concerned how much coal was produced and whether the business was profitable. The feudal foremen only knew how to oppress the workers. Although a safety plan was formulated, it was not implemented. Even the deputy manager and security section chief, Ding Dianqin, himself was unaware that he held such a position. From May 3rd, the mine experienced four consecutive poisoning accidents within three days, but no one paid attention. However, they noticed that the coal quality was very good and ordered the workers to continue mining. On the fourth day, May 7th, a major water inrush and poisoning accident erupted. In addition, in some factories, in order to complete tasks, overtime work was imposed without limit, which not only seriously affected the workers' health but also caused casualty accidents. For example, the Taiyuan Machinery Factory extended working hours without limit, averaging 12 hours of work per day, and even required consecutive shifts. Yang Zhongkui, a worker at the factory, died of electric shock on July 25th because he worked 16 consecutive hours and was too tired to pay attention to the coordination with the worker who switched off the power.

Secondly, some factories and mines have had certain achievements in safety work in the past, and some have even been commended. However, due to their arrogance and complacency, they failed to maintain their honor. For example, Qi Shuyuan, the deputy director of the Fuguo Mine and director of the Third Pit of the Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China, had achieved results in his work in the past and had also been selected as a model party member. However, he gradually developed arrogance and complacency. He believed that "there is nothing wrong in the pit, it is as solid as a wall of bronze and iron." However, a major roof collapse accident occurred in the pit last year. Pit Director Qi Shuyuan did not learn from this lesson. On April 14th this year, he discovered the smell of gasoline in the pit (a sign of spontaneous combustion) and that the gas concentration had reached more than 5%. According to regulations, work should have been stopped, and the technician also suggested stopping work. However, Qi Shuyuan wanted to "consider it further" and delayed for two days. Although part of the work was stopped, a major gas explosion accident occurred on the third day.

Bureaucracy in leadership is also a major obstacle to implementing safety in production. For example, the East Inclined Shaft of the Second Mine of the Fengfeng Coal Mine had only one tunnel, meaning that the transportation lane and pedestrian walkway were not separated according to safety regulations, and necessary safety equipment such as canopies, switches, safety ropes, and safety holes were not provided. Workers repeatedly proposed suggestions for modifying safety protection equipment, but they did not attract the attention and adoption of the leadership. Finally, on May 29th, due to the mistakes of the hook and the hook worker, a runaway train accident occurred, killing and injuring eight workers in the lane. Another example is the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau. Due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading personnel, especially some on-site leading personnel, they did not implement labor discipline and neglected safety education for the workers, resulting in the employees disregarding regulations. Train collision and derailment accidents continued to occur in May and June, killing and injuring 26 people, and causing more than 1 billion yuan in losses to state property.

There are also some factory and mine personnel who do not implement labor protection laws or simply disregard labor protection laws, which has also caused serious casualty accidents. According to incomplete statistics from the Central Ministry of Labor, from January 1951 to July 1952, 107 poisoning accidents involving the handling of dangerous goods such as asphalt occurred continuously in 31 cities, including Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuhan, over 19 months. The main reason is that the packaging is not good, and these leaders or managers do not follow the "Several Measures on the Handling of Dangerous Goods" promulgated by the Central Ministry of Labor, and even deliberately deceive, causing workers to be poisoned. When Chongqing Transport Company transported asphalt and net heavy oil in June of this year, the company's technical security personnel knew it was toxic, but they did not report to the leadership as required, nor did they make good protective equipment, allowing workers to transport it at risk, resulting in workers being poisoned.

In order to safeguard state laws and regulations and oppose the bad tendency of neglecting safety in production, this committee and local supervision committees have seriously dealt with the personnel who made mistakes in these accident cases. For example, Liu Zhao, the acting manager of Yingfeng Coal Mine, Ding Dianqin, the deputy manager, and Zheng Jinxiang, the head of the kiln, have all been dismissed and transferred to the court for severe punishment. Zhao Ming, the factory director of Kailuan Majiagou Brick Factory, Hu Maoxiang, the deputy factory director, Qi Shuyuan, the deputy director of Xi'an Fuguo Mine, and others have all been dismissed. Other relevant personnel have also been given appropriate punishments.

The continuous occurrence of these accidents shows that the tendency to neglect safety in production in some state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines during the production increase and economy campaign is very serious. In order to smoothly carry out the patriotic production increase and economy competition movement, factories and mines in various places should learn from these lessons and take the following measures:

(1) Strictly criticize the purely task-oriented viewpoint and the one-sided economic accounting viewpoint that ignores safety in production and does not care about the life and health of employees among leaders and technical management personnel at all levels, and clearly establish the concept of safety in production. Leading cadres at all levels should deeply recognize that the purely task-oriented viewpoint and the one-sided economic accounting ideology, which neglect safety in production and do not care about the life and health of employees, are capitalist management ideas and methods. The result is serious casualty accidents, causing serious losses to production, especially seriously endangering the health and lives of employees, which is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of people's enterprises and our national system. Leading personnel of factories and mines at all levels must understand that the production increase and economy competition movement and safety in production are not opposites, but two aspects of the same problem. Without safety in production, it is impossible for the production increase and economy movement to achieve sound development.

(2) Factories and mines in various places should continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. Those who have made contributions to the implementation of the safety in production policy should be promptly commended and rewarded. Those responsible for taking an irresponsible attitude towards production and the life and health of employees, neither actively improving safety equipment and strengthening protection, nor adopting correct suggestions from employees, thereby causing major casualty accidents, should be given serious punishment or even legal sanctions. Leading personnel of factories and mines at all levels should combine inspection and arrangement of production tasks with organization of production competitions, and regularly inspect and arrange production safety work, and care for the life and health of employees.

(3) Factories and mines in various places should strictly implement the labor laws and regulations stipulated by the central government and governments at all levels. Labor administration and industrial and commercial management departments at all levels should pay special attention to the implementation of safety in production and labor protection in private factories and mines with simple equipment, and conduct regular supervision and inspection. Various business management departments should formulate or revise and enrich safety in production methods and regulations, so that safety in production can be consolidated from a system perspective.

(4) Establish and improve the competent authority for safety in production, improve safety in production equipment, strengthen protection, strictly implement the safety in production responsibility system, and summarize and promote experience in safety in production, and correct the phenomenon of simple safety equipment and no one being responsible.

(5) In order to carry out a broad safety in production education among employees, and to correct the phenomenon of neglecting safety in production from the ideological, organizational, systemic, and equipment perspectives, we suggest that all localities conduct a universal and in-depth safety inspection this year to welcome next year's large-scale construction tasks.

    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会
    关于处理某些国营、地方国营厂矿企业忽视安全生产致发生重大伤亡事故的通报
    自全国各地厂矿企业在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上热烈地展开爱国增产节约运动以来，已获得巨大的成绩。但由于某些厂矿企业的领导人员片面强调生产任务，忽视安全，致使伤亡事故最近又不断发生，影响了增产节约运动的正常开展，这是必须严肃纠正的。
    根据本委和各地监委最近处理的一部分事故案件分析：某些厂矿企业的领导人员存在着严重的单纯任务观点，是造成伤亡事故的重要原因。他们可以在“为了完成生产任务”、“为了贯彻经济核算制”等口号之下，无限制地提高工人劳动强度，延长工作时间，甚至鼓励工人去“赴汤蹈火”。如开滦马家沟砖厂，事前对工作不抓紧，生产不能按计划完成，为了不误合同期限，避免罚款，厂长赵明、副厂长胡懋庠等明知窑内温度在摄氏一百三十度以上，却动员工人从热窑中取砖。赵明和胡懋庠并联名给工人写信、送茶叶，鼓励工人今后“继续发挥这种伟大爱国热情”。工会干部不但熟视无睹，反编写快板：“出热窑、上火线，各个英雄使劲干”加以鼓动。结果四十三名工人中被烤伤四十
    一名，有的几被烧死。又如河南荥丰煤矿，依靠封建把头经营，领导思想只问出煤多少，生意赔赚，封建把头则只知道压迫工人。订了安全计划，毫不执行，甚至副经理兼保安股长丁殿钦自己还不知道他有这么一个职务。该矿自五月三日起三天内连续发生了四次中毒等事故，没有人注意，可是他们却注意到煤质很好，叫工人继续开采，至第四天即五月七日就爆发了透水中毒的重大事故。此外，在某些工厂中，为了完成任务，加班加点，不仅严重地影响了工人健康，且造成伤亡事故。如太原机械厂无限制地延长工作时间，平均每日工作十二小时，还要连班工作，该厂工人杨忠魁于七月二十五日因连班工作至十六小时，由于疲劳过度，未能注意与关电闸工人呼应，致触电身死。
    其次，也有某些厂矿企业，过去在保安工作上曾有一定成绩，有的还受过表扬，但由于他们骄傲自满，致不能继续保持荣誉。如东北西安煤矿富国矿副矿长兼三坑坑长綦书元，过去工作有成绩，也曾被选为模范党员，但逐渐滋长起骄傲自满情绪，他认为“坑内没事，如铜墙铁壁”，可是去年坑内就发生了一次重大冒顶事故。坑长綦书元没有接受这个教训，今年四月十四日，发现坑内有汽油味（自然发火象征），瓦斯已达百分之五以上，按照规定应该停工，技术员也提出了停工意见，但是綦书元要“再考虑”，拖延了两天，虽然部分停工了，但是第三天就发生了瓦斯爆炸的重大事故。
    领导上的官僚主义也是贯彻安全生产的重大障碍。例如：峰峰煤矿第二矿东斜井，只有一个坑道，即没有根据保安规程把运输巷与人行道分开，也不作罐档、道岔、保险绳及保安洞等必要的安全设备。工人多次提出改装安全防护设备的建议，一直未引起领导上注意和采纳，终于在五月二十九日，由于挂钩及把钩工人的错误，发生跑车事故，将在巷道中的工人撞死、撞伤八名。又如西北铁路干线工程局，由于领导人员，特别是有些现场领导人员的官僚主义作风，不执行劳动纪律、忽视对工人的安全教育，致职工漠视规章，在五、六月中不断发生列车冲突及颠覆事故，死伤二十六人，国家财产损失达十余亿元。
    还有一些厂矿企业人员，不执行劳动保护法令或根本漠视劳动保护法令，也造成了严重的伤亡事故。据中央劳动部不完全的统计，自一九五一年一月至五二年七月，十九个月中间，在天津、青岛、武汉等三十一个城市，连续发生搬运沥青等危险品中毒事故一○七次。主要原因一方面是包装不好，一方面则是这些领导或管理人员，不按照中央劳动部所颁布的“关于搬运危险性物品的几项办法”办事，甚至有意欺骗，致使工人中毒。重庆市搬运公司于今年六月搬运柏油、净重油时，该公司技术保安人员明知有毒，既不按规定报告领导，也未作好防护设备，听任工人冒险搬运，以致工人中毒。
    本委和各地监委为了维护国家法纪，反对忽视安全生产的恶劣倾向，对于这些事故案件中犯错误的人员都已做了严肃的处理，如荥丰煤矿代经理刘钊、副经理丁殿钦、总窑头郑金相等，均已撤职移送法院严惩；开滦马家沟砖厂厂长赵明、副厂长胡懋庠，西安富国矿副矿长綦书元等均已撤职；其他有关人员，亦均给予适当的处分。
    这些事故的不断发生，说明了某些国营、地方国营厂矿企业在增产节约运动中忽视安全生产的偏向是很严重的。为了顺利开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动，各地厂矿企业应该吸取这些教训，并采取下列措施：
    （一）应在各级领导与技术管理人员中，严格批判忽视安全生产、不关心职工生命与健康的单纯任务观点和片面的经济核算观点，明确树立安全生产思想。各级领导干部应深刻认识单纯任务观点和片面的经济核算思想忽视安全生产不关心职工生命健康，是资本主义的经营思想与管理方法，其结果则是造成重大伤亡事故，使生产遭受严重损失，特别使职工健康和生命遭受严重危害，是与人民企业的性质及我们的国家制度根本不能相容的，各级厂矿企业领导人员必须了解增产节约竞赛运动与安全生产不是对立的，而是一个问题的两个方面，没有安全生产就不可能使增产节约运动获得健全的发展。
    （二）各地厂矿企业应在“三反”胜利的基础上继续开展反官僚主义的斗争。对执行安全生产方针有功的人员应及时表扬奖励，对那些对生产与职工生命健康采取不负责任态度，既不主动改善安全设备加强防护，又不采纳职工正确建议因而造成重大伤亡事故之责任者，应给予严肃的处理乃至法律的制裁。各级厂矿企业领导人员应结合检查与布置生产任务组织生产竞赛，经常地检查与布置生产安全工作，关心职工的生命和健康。
    （三）各地厂矿企业应严格贯彻中央与各级政府规定的劳动法令。各级劳动行政及工商管理部门应特别注意对设备简陋的私营厂矿执行安全生产与劳动保护情况，经常进行监督与检查。各业务管理部门应制订或修订充实安全生产的办法条例，使安全生产从制度上得到巩固。
    （四）建立与健全安全生产的主管机构，改善安全生产设备，加强防护，严格贯彻安全生产责任制并总结推广安全生产的经验，纠正安全设备简陋与无人负责的现象。
    （五）为了在职工中进行一次广泛的安全生产教育，及从思想上、组织上、制度上、设备上纠正忽视安全生产的现象，我们建议各地今年举行一次普遍而又深入的安全大检查，以迎接明年大规模的建设任务。
