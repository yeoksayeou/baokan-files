    Another Manifestation of the US War Economic Crisis
    Prices in the United States have recently soared again, especially food prices, which have generally risen, with the highest increasing by 50%, causing the cost of living index to rise to a historical peak. This signifies a further deterioration of the lives of the American people.
    For several years after the war, US prices have continued to rise. This is due to the US government's implementation of an arms expansion and war preparation policy, with military spending increasing year by year, resulting in the evil consequences of inflation. After launching the war of aggression against Korea, the US government implemented so-called price controls, but prices continued to rise. By the beginning of this year, US prices were actually more than double what they were before the war. US monopoly capitalists have obtained unprecedented huge profits, while the living standards of the American working people have been drastically reduced.
    It is known that the US ruling clique is frantically promoting a policy of arms expansion and war preparation in order to save the economic crisis formed by the post-war economic recession. However, this method of "drinking poison to quench thirst", while stimulating the abnormal development of US military production, has further damaged the US economy. As a result of increased military spending and rising prices, the purchasing power of the American people has further shrunk. By April of this year, the US domestic market had shown signs of recession again; consumer goods and even some military industrial products were experiencing sluggish sales, and the prices of durable goods began to fall. Under these circumstances, instead of stopping arms expansion and war preparation to restore the people's purchasing power, the Truman government adopted measures to abolish credit controls and weaken general price controls, attempting to stimulate prices in order to maintain a false prosperity. At the same time, the Truman government also approved raising steel prices. All of this contributed to rising prices. It is thus clear how the US government is willing to sacrifice the interests of the American people to maintain the excessive profits of monopoly capitalists.
    Another reason for the recent new surge in US prices is the drought that occurred in the southeastern and northeastern United States this year, resulting in reduced harvests of grains, cotton, and other crops, and a shortage of food and some industrial raw materials. This disaster is also a result of the US government's implementation of its war policy. In the US post-war budgets, the vast majority of funds have been used to expand armaments. For example, military spending in 1952-1953 accounted for more than 80% of the total budget, while civilian construction has been completely abandoned, and therefore it is naturally impossible to overcome the disasters caused by drought to agriculture.
    Curbing rising prices and inflation has become one of the important topics of the Democratic and Republican parties in the election, which shows the seriousness of its impact on the lives of the American people. However, the two reactionary parties are only shifting responsibility to each other on this issue to deceive the people. In reality, the US ruling clique has no intention and cannot possibly alleviate the rise in prices. The policy of arms expansion and war preparation they are pursuing can only further lead the US economy to a more serious crisis.

### 美国战争经济危机的又一表现

    美国战争经济危机的又一表现
    美国物价最近又扶摇直上，特别是食物价格普遍上涨，最高的涨了百分之五十，使得生活费用指数上升到了历史的最高峰。这意味着美国人民生活的进一步恶化。
    战后数年来美国物价不断上涨，这是由于美国政府执行扩军备战政策，军费开支一年比一年增大，以致引起了通货膨胀所造成的恶果。美国政府在发动侵朝战争后，虽实行了所谓物价管制，但物价却仍继续上涨，到今年年初美国的物价实际上已等于战前两倍多。美国垄断资本家获得了空前巨大的利润，而美国劳动人民的生活水平却急剧降低。
    人们知道，美国统治集团疯狂地推行扩军备战政策，是为了挽救战后的经济萧条所形成的经济危机。但是这种饮鸩止渴的办法，虽刺激了美国军事生产的畸形发展，却进一步伤害了美国经济。由于军费负担加重和物价上涨的结果，美国人民的购买力更趋萎缩，到今年四月间美国国内市场便又呈现出不景气的现象；民用消费商品甚至部分军用工业产品都发生滞销，耐用物品价格开始下降。在这种情形下，杜鲁门政府非但不从停止扩军备战入手，以图恢复人民的购买力，反而采取了取消信用管制与削弱一般物价管制的措施，企图刺激物价，以维持虚假的繁荣。与此同时，杜鲁门政府并批准提高钢价。这都促成了物价的上涨。由此可见，美国政府是如何地不惜牺牲美国人民的利益来维护垄断资本家的超额利润。
    美国物价最近发生新涨风的另外一个原因，是美国东南部和东北部今年发生旱灾，谷物、棉花及其他农作物歉收，粮食和一部分工业原料供应缺乏而造成的。这种灾害也是美国政府执行战争政策的结果。美国战后历年的预算中，绝大部分的款项都用于扩张军备，如一九五二——一九五三年度的军费竟占了预算总额的百分之八十以上，而对于民用建设则完全废置不顾，因此自然无法克服天旱给农业造成的灾害。
    制止物价上涨和通货膨胀已成为民主党和共和党在竞选中的重要题目之一，可见其对于美国人民生活影响的严重。但是两个反动政党只是在这个问题上互相推卸责任，借以欺骗人民，而实际上美国的统治集团无意也不可能缓和物价的上涨。它们所推行的扩军备战政策只能进一步将美国经济引向更为严重的危机。
