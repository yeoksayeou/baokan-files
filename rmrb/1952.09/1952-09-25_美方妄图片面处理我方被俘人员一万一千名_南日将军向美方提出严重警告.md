(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 24) General Nan Ri, Chief Delegate of our delegation to the Korean Armistice Talks, was instructed on September 24th to issue a stern warning to the opposing side regarding their serious provocative action of attempting to unilaterally hand over 11,000 of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang as cannon fodder, under the guise of releasing so-called "detained civilians." The full text of General Nan Ri's letter to General Harrison, the opposing side's Chief Delegate, is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation:

I am instructed to issue a stern warning to your side regarding your new provocative act of attempting to unilaterally dispose of 11,000 of our captured personnel. Only the POW issue stands in the way of a Korean armistice. It is clear that the POW issue can only be resolved fairly and reasonably through negotiations between both sides. Our side has consistently advocated resolving the POW issue through negotiation. This provocative action that your side is preparing to take shows that your side has no intention of achieving a fair and reasonable armistice in Korea and realizing the peace aspirations of the people of the world.

Immediately releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice is a clear stipulation of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Your side claims that the majority of the countries you represent have signed this convention and that there is no reason not to abide by it. However, your side's continuous persecution and massacre of prisoners of war, and its insistence on detaining prisoners of war, completely violate the clear stipulations of the Geneva Convention.

Your side has no right to unilaterally dispose of any of our captured personnel under your custody. Your side, under the guise of releasing so-called "detained civilians," arbitrarily detains our captured personnel as cannon fodder, attempting to use this as capital to continue and expand the Korean War, which our side cannot tolerate. Your side must immediately cease this unilateral and illegal act. Otherwise, your side must bear the responsibility for all serious consequences arising therefrom.

General Nan Ri
Chief Delegate of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation

    美方妄图片面处理我方被俘人员一万一千名
    南日将军向美方提出严重警告
    【新华社开城二十四日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军，就对方假借所谓释放“被拘留平民”的名义，企图片面将一万一千名我方被俘人员送交李承晚匪帮当炮灰的严重挑衅行动，于九月二十四日奉命向对方提出严重警告。南日将军致对方首席代表哈利逊的信的全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    对你方企图片面处理我方被俘人员一万一千人的新的挑衅行为，我奉命向你方提出严重警告。只有一个遣俘问题阻碍着朝鲜的停战，很显然，遣俘问题只有在谈判中经由双方协商才能取得公平合理的解决。我方一贯主张经由谈判解决遣俘问题。你方所准备采取的这个挑衅行动，显示你方无意于在朝鲜达成公平合理的停战，实现世界人民的和平愿望。
    停战后立即释放并遣返全部战俘，本是一九四九年日内瓦公约的明确规定。你方自称所代表的大多数国家在这个公约上签了字，决无不遵守该公约之理。但你方不断迫害和屠杀战俘的行为和扣留战俘的主张，却彻底地违反了日内瓦公约的明确规定。
    你方没有任何权利片面处理在你方收容下的任何一个我方被俘人员。你方假借释放所谓“被拘留平民”的名义，擅自扣留我方被俘人员当炮灰，企图以此作为继续与扩大朝鲜战争的资本，尤为我方所不能容忍。你方必须立即停止这种片面非法行为。否则你方必须负担由此而产生的一切严重后果的责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表  南日将军
    一九五二年九月二十四日
