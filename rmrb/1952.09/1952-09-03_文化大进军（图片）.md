    Cultural Great Advance
    By Peng Bin and Sun Hanchun
    10. 注音符号 (Zhuyin symbols) are not difficult when spelled individually, but it's a bit difficult when two are put together. For example, I couldn't put "勹" and "ㄚ" together no matter how hard I tried. Either I spelled out a "勹" or an "ㄚ". Everyone else could spell it, but I couldn't. Old Wang had even more trouble than I did. Later, Zhou Dabao and I studied it together. He said, "The first sound is light and short, the second sound is heavy, and the two sounds are connected with a rush." Old Wang and I tried it, and we spelled it out successfully.
    11. It's even more difficult to spell three sounds together. However, before teaching, the teacher taught us a rhyme for spelling, and we memorized the key points of the three-sound spelling. Then, the teacher wrote some spelling methods on the blackboard, such as "勹一比", "攵一皮", "攵ㄨ扑"... We found them easy to pronounce and interesting. Before evening, we had mastered the three-sound spelling.
    12. The curriculum changed again on the fourth day. The teacher said, "Learning pinyin is like mastering a weapon to attack new characters. Today, we are going to learn three hundred characters. Let's bring out the spirit of charging into battle, only advancing and not retreating!" The teacher's teaching method is also very different from before. For example, "速" is the "速" of quick action. It is simple and easy to remember, as if it were stamped in our minds. In less than twenty minutes, more than a hundred characters were taught.

    十、注音符号单拼倒不难，可是两个拼在一起就有点困难了。比方“勹ㄚ”这两个字拼了半天硬是拼不到一块，不是拼出个“勹”来，就是拼出个“ㄚ”来，别人都能拼了，我还拼不出来。老王比我还吃力，后来我和周大保一齐研究，他说：“前音轻短后音重，两音相连猛一冲，就行了。”我和老王试验后，果然拼出来了。
    十一、三个音拼在一起就更难了。不过，教员在教之前先教了个拼音要领歌，歌子学会了，三拼音要领也记熟了。随后，教员在黑板上写了些“勹一比”、“攵一皮”、“攵ㄨ扑”……的拼音办法，我们念起来又顺嘴，又有趣，没到晚上，就把三拼音也拼熟了。
    十二、第四天课目又变了。教员说：“学了拼音，好比掌握武器来突击生字，今天要学三百字，拿出冲锋陷阵的精神来，只有前进，没有后退！”教员的教法跟以前也大不一样了，比方“速”就是动作迅速的“速”，又简单，又好记，就好像钢印印在脑子里，不到二十分钟就教了一百多字。
