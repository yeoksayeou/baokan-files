Changdu Communication The Joyful Jinsha River
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zong Zidu

The Tibetan people on both banks of the Jinsha River in Xikang Province have gradually obtained a happy life in the affectionate and harmonious big family of all ethnic groups in the motherland in the two years since liberation. Before liberation, the largest Gangtuo ferry on the Jinsha River had only twenty or so small, dilapidated adobe houses, and a few round cowhide boats were moored. Now, it has completely changed its former desolate and lonely appearance. The heroic Kangzang Highway, passing through many cliffs and precipices, spans the Jinsha River here, bringing unprecedented prosperity to the Tibetan people on both sides of the Jinsha River and the Gangtuo ferry. Large and small ships carrying cars and supplies travel back and forth on the river all day long. In June of this year, several thousand tons of grain were transported from here to the western region, and in July, as many as three thousand loads of tea were transported to the western region. At the same time, the amount of native and special products such as wool, cowhide, and cordyceps transported from the western region through this ferry to Jiangdong and then to the inland is also increasing day by day. Mule and horse teams and yak teams carrying these native and special products are crowded on both sides of the ferry. At present, large quantities of timber and equipment are being transported to the Gangtuo ferry across the river. More than a dozen tall new houses have been newly built at the foot of the green mountains on both sides of the ferry, with rows of tents arranged, and merchants gather, like a new city. Recently, the People's Bank of China, the China Department Store, and the China Native Produce Company have established branches and mobile teams on both sides of the Jinsha River to actively help the Tibetan people develop agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry and commerce. In July of this year, the prices of local and special products have doubled compared with before liberation.

Before liberation, the two banks of the Jinsha River were isolated and impassable, and the people on both banks could not travel freely, because at that time Jiangdong was the place ruled by the Kuomintang reactionary regime; while the west bank of the river was under the jurisdiction of the Tibetan local government. Now this obstacle has been eliminated, and the people on both sides of the Jinsha River can travel freely, and materials are also unobstructed, and light and happiness are being displayed before the eyes of the Tibetan people on both sides of the river. Last year, the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region was established on the east bank of Jiangdong, and the Tibetan people here have their own regime. The place on the west bank of the Yangtze River, which was previously considered "poor mountains and bad waters," is now also showing a vigorous and new atmosphere. The Tibetan people have established many new homes. People who could not afford clothes in the past have now taken off their tattered sheepskin coats that they have worn for many years and put on brand new clothes. Seventeen households in Xinlong Village, Dege County, on the east bank of the Gangtuo ferry, fled to the E Luo area to escape the heavy corvee labor before liberation. After liberation, they have all returned to their hometowns. In order to help them settle down and produce, the people's government lent them 800 catties of seeds during the spring plowing last year alone. Now, the Kangzang Plateau has high skies and refreshing air, and groups of Tibetan men and women are harvesting golden highland barley in the fields. Laughter is also everywhere on both sides of the Jinsha River. In the evening, on the grassland and on the river bank, the "Guozhuang" team sings heartily:

   The bright red sun,
   Shines on the Jinsha River,
   Thousands of flowers bloom on the top of the mountain,
   Pine and cypress are lush,
   Cattle and sheep abound,
   Highland barley is everywhere.

The surging Jinsha River carries the joyful songs of the people on both sides, and flows day and night, and it will merge with the joyful songs of the people in the interior.

    昌都通讯欢乐的金沙江
    新华社记者　宗子度
    西康境内金沙江两岸的藏族人民，解放两年来，在祖国各民族友爱和睦的大家庭中，已逐渐获得了幸福的生活。解放前，金沙江上最大的岗沱渡口只有二十来间矮小、残破的小土屋，停泊着几只圆形的牛皮船。现在，已完全改变了昔日荒凉、冷寂的面貌。英雄的康藏公路，穿过了许多悬岩绝壁，在这里横跨金沙江，给金沙江两岸藏族人民和岗沱渡口带来了空前的繁荣，江面上整日来往着载运汽车和物资的大小船只。今年六月里，从这里过渡运到西面地区的粮食有好几千吨，七月里运到西面去的茶叶即达三千驮。同时，从西面地区经过这个渡口运到江东转往内地的羊毛、牛皮和虫草等土产、特产，也日益增多。驮运这些土产、特产的骡马队、牦牛队拥挤在渡口两岸。目前，大批木材和器材正向岗沱渡口源源赶运过江。渡口两岸青山脚下已新建了十多座高大的新房，排列着一行行的帐篷，商贩云集，好像一个新兴的城市。最近，中国人民银行、中国百货公司、中国土产公司已在金沙江两岸设立分公司和流动小组，积极帮助藏族人民发展农业、牧业和工商业。今年七月里，当地土产、特产的价格已较解放前提高了一倍。
    在解放以前，金沙江两岸是阻隔不通的，两岸人民也不能自由往来，因为那时江东是国民党反动政权统治的地方；而江西岸是西藏地方政府管辖的。现在这个障碍消除了，金沙江两岸的人民可以自由地往来了，物资也畅通了，光明和幸福正展现在江两岸的藏族人民的眼前。去年江东岸成立了西康藏族自治区，这里的藏族人民便有了自己的政权。江西岸过去被人认为“穷山恶水”的地方，现在也呈显出一片蓬勃新生的气象。藏民们已建立起很多新的家园，过去穿不上衣服的人们，现在已脱去了多年来破烂的羊皮袄，换上了崭新的衣服。岗沱渡口东岸的德格县新龙村十七户人家，解放前因负担不起繁重的差役，曾全部逃到俄洛地区去避难，解放后他们都已回到故乡。人民政府为了帮助他们安家生产，仅在去年春耕时就贷给他们八百斤种籽。现在，康藏高原上天高气爽，成群的男女藏民正在地里收割金黄色的青稞。金沙江两岸也到处洋溢着欢笑。傍晚，在草原上，在江岸上，“锅庄”队纵情地歌唱：
    鲜红的太阳，
    照呀照在金沙江上，
    山顶上万花开，
    松柏茂盛，
    牛羊一片，
    青稞遍地。
    奔腾的金沙江带着两岸人民欢乐的歌声，日夜不停的奔流着，它将和内地人民欢乐的歌声融合在一起。
