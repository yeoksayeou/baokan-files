The Right Reverend Chen Jianzhen, Bishop Chairman, and the Right Reverend Zheng Jianye, General Secretary, of the Standing Committee of the China Anglican Church, sent a letter on the 16th on behalf of all believers of the China Anglican Church to the Chinese delegation attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, expressing warm support for the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The full text of the letter is as follows:
To Comrade Song Qingling, Head of the Chinese Delegation, and Comrades Guo Moruo and Peng Zhen, Deputy Heads, attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference:

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to be held in our capital, Beijing, and peace-loving people all over the world are cheering for it. Many of the delegates from various countries participating in the conference are Christian believers, and we are extremely encouraged and excited by this. Because true Christian believers are peace-loving. The call to strive for and defend lasting world peace is entirely in line with our Christian doctrine.

Our Bible records the words of the peace prophet Micah, who pointed out that in the ideal world of the future, all people's efforts will be focused only on peaceful production for the benefit of mankind, and no longer on war: "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore; but they shall all sit under their own vines and under their own fig trees, and no one shall make them afraid." However, in order to strive to achieve this beautiful state, the prophet Micah also realistically called on people to take active action to strive for and defend peace. He cried out, "Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops; he hath laid siege against us." Now the representatives of the peace-loving people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are coming to gather into troops, and the peace-loving people all over the world will gather even more closely into troops. Let the imperialist war instigators tremble, the more consolidated the forces defending peace, the more difficult it will be for them to launch wars of aggression!

Please tell the representatives of the peace-loving people of all countries that we, on behalf of all believers of the Christian China Anglican Church, pay our respects to them; all our believers unanimously and warmly support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference; we congratulate the conference on the successful completion of its noble mission, and are willing to further strive for the cause of peace under the call of the conference.

Right Reverend Chen Jianzhen, Bishop Chairman, Standing Committee of the China Anglican Church
Right Reverend Zheng Jianye, General Secretary

    中华圣公会函我国代表团拥护和平会议
    【新华社讯】中华圣公会常务委员会主席陈见真主教、总干事郑建业主教，于十六日代表中华圣公会全体信徒致函中国出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表团，表示热烈拥护召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。信的全文如下：出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议中国代表团宋庆龄团长郭沫若彭真副团长
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在我国首都北京召开，全世界和平人民都为它热烈欢呼。参加大会的各国代表中有不少是基督教信徒，我们为此异常鼓舞兴奋。因为真正的基督信徒都是酷爱和平的。争取并保卫世界持久和平的号召，完全合乎我们基督教的教义。
    我们的圣经中记载着和平先知弥迦的话，他预指在将来的理想世界里，人们的一切努力都将只放在造福人群的和平生产上面，而不再放在战争上面：“要将刀打成犁头，把枪打成镰刀。这国不举刀攻击那国，也不再学习战事。人人都要坐在自己的葡萄树下，无人惊吓。”但是，为了争取达到这一美好的境地，弥迦先知也现实地号召人们起来积极行动，以争取并保卫和平。他呼号说，“成群的民哪，现在要聚集成队，因为仇敌攻击我们。”现在亚洲及太平洋区域各国和平人民的代表就是要来聚集成队，全世界和平人民也都将更紧密地聚集成队。让帝国主义战争挑拨者们发抖吧，保卫和平的力量愈巩固，他们就愈难发动起侵略战争了！
    请告诉各国和平人民的代表们，我们代表基督教中华圣公会全体信徒向他们致敬；我们全体信徒一致热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开；我们祝贺大会胜利完成其崇高的使命，并愿在大会的感召下进一步为和平事业而努力奋斗。

    郑建业主教
