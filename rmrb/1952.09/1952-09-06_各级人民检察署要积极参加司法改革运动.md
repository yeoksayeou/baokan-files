People's Procuratorates at All Levels Should Actively Participate in the Judicial Reform Movement
Lan Gongwu, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate

The judicial reform movement, which is of great political significance, is currently being carried out throughout the country. The purpose of the judicial reform is to further eliminate the influence of reactionary old legal concepts and old judicial work styles in the people's judicial organs on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, so as to purify the people's courts at all levels from the organizational and ideological work style, and thereby completely smash the remnants of the old judicial system and implement the new people's judicial system. The completion of the judicial reform is of great significance for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguarding national construction and the vital interests of the people.

People's procuratorial work is an important part of the people's judicial work. Judicial reform is not only for building new people's court work, but also has important significance for establishing the business thinking, work system, and work style of people's procuratorial work. Further maintaining and improving the purity of the people's procuratorial organs from the organizational and ideological aspects is the primary task of the people's procuratorates in the judicial reform movement.

Since our people's procuratorial organs were established on a completely new basis after the birth of New China and after thoroughly smashing the Kuomintang's reactionary old procuratorial institutions, and since we have always adhered to the principle of "rather fewer, but better" in the conditions of the people's procuratorial cadres, drawing a group of old cadres who have been tested by revolutionary work and war as the backbone, supplemented by pure educated youth, therefore, the organization of the people's procuratorates in various places is generally relatively pure; however, in the various movements in the past two years, especially in the "Three-Anti" movement, a small number of people's procuratorates in some places have also exposed the phenomenon of impure organization, which cannot be ignored. In the "Three-Anti" movement, the Central and Southern Branch of our procuratorate found that Ming Zixing, a former judicial officer, was bought by six illegal merchants and fabricated false accounts and evaded taxes for the merchants. The legal documents were all drafted by Ming Zixing, who completely became an agent of the illegal capitalists in the people's procuratorial organs. Some procuratorial organs believe that the absence of former judicial personnel or those who have studied the old law in the organs is equivalent to the absence of the influence of the old legal thinking, which is also wrong. The "separation of powers" thinking on the leadership issue of the procuratorial organs in some places is a serious manifestation of the old legal thinking. Some procuratorates in various places do not understand the important role of the people's procuratorial work in ensuring the implementation of national policies and laws, and do not understand that procuratorial work must serve politics and serve the movement; they mistakenly believe that participating in the movement is not the business of the procuratorate, and only "writing indictments," "appearing in court to make arguments," and "inspections" are "business"; they even believe that procuratorial work is an "optional" accessory of the judicial system. This is actually the old judicial system's view of treating the people's procuratorial organs as appendages of the court. There are also very few procuratorial work cadres who use old legal viewpoints to handle cases. For example, a procuratorial work cadre in a certain place did not determine the crime based on the facts of the crime and its harm to the people, but copied the reactionary old legal clauses and described the serious crime of setting up private courts and illegally detaining workers as "obstructing freedom," and determined the illegal and undisciplined behavior of a certain principal who raped female students and damaged the people's education cause as "offending public morals," and so on. Although there have been some new creations and experiences in the people's procuratorial work in the past two years, from the perspective of the overall business policy of the procuratorial work, "what to do? how to do?" is still a question that has not been completely resolved in some places. The idea of proceeding from reality, boldly creating, and summarizing experience is not clear, and they only shout slogans vaguely, or engage in empty and useless arguments, without investigating and researching from reality and summarizing experience. What's more, they simply emphasize the so-called "formal" system and procedures, which is essentially adhering to conventions, only seeking form, not content, and leading the work into a narrow circle of事務主義, detaching from reality and the masses. Therefore, the people's procuratorial organs in various places must combine the judicial reform movement, conduct universal and in-depth study, examine business thinking and work policies, affirm achievements, correct shortcomings, summarize experience, and clarify the direction. To this end, full criticism and self-criticism must be launched. Leading cadres who have old legal views and old judicial work styles must make profound self-criticism. The influence of old legal thinking should be distinguished from general business work issues. Various places should also analyze and criticize typical thoughts and typical events according to the specific circumstances, in order to improve understanding. At the same time, attention should be paid to absorbing the rich experience of the people's court work and certain creations that some people's courts have already made in their work, and establishing new systems and new work styles in work.

Assisting the people's courts at all levels to actively promote the development of the judicial reform movement is one of the central tasks of the people's procuratorial organs at all levels. In the past, the people's procuratorial organs in various places have investigated many cases of wrongful detention, wrongful judgment, and corruption and bribery by bad elements among judicial personnel, which is directly related to the impure organization and impure ideological work style of the courts. The people's procuratorial organs must carry out a resolute struggle against these illegal phenomena. In this judicial reform movement, the people's procuratorial organs in various places should, in accordance with the unified policy and guidelines of the government, draw on past experience, mobilize the masses to expose the illegal behavior of bad elements among judicial personnel, and investigate major cases of illegal judgments, and conduct serious handling in conjunction with the movement. For typical events, they should be widely publicized to expose the reactionary essence of the old legal thinking and its harm to the country and the people, in order to promote the development of the movement. At the same time, attention should be paid to absorbing the experience of this judicial reform movement, which will be very beneficial for the people's procuratorial organs to rely on the masses to carry out judicial supervision work in the future.

    各级人民检察署要积极参加司法改革运动
    最高人民检察署副检察长　蓝公武
    目前全国各地正在开展具有重大政治意义的司法改革运动。司法改革的目的，是为了在“三反”运动胜利的基础上进一步肃清反动的旧法观点和旧司法作风在人民司法机关中的影响，使各级人民法院从组织上和思想作风上纯洁起来，并由此彻底打碎旧司法制度的残余，贯彻新的人民的司法制度。司法改革的完成，对于巩固人民民主专政，保障国家建设和人民的切身利益，有非常重大的意义。
    人民检察工作是人民司法工作的重要组成部分。司法改革不仅是为了建设新的人民法院工作，并且对于树立人民检察工作的业务思想、工作制度、工作作风也有其重要的意义。进一步从组织上、思想上保持与提高人民检察机关的纯洁性，是人民检察署在司法改革运动中的首要任务。
    由于我们的人民检察机关是在新中国诞生之后和彻底打碎了国民党反动的旧检察机构之后、完全在新的基础上建立起来的，由于我们在人民检察干部的条件上一开始就坚持了“宁肯少些，但要好些”的方针，抽调了一批久经革命工作和战争考验的老干部作骨干，辅之以纯洁的知识青年，因此，各地人民检察署的组织一般说是比较纯洁的；但有些地方在两年多来的各次运动中，特别是在“三反”运动中，也暴露了少数地方的人民检察署有组织不纯的现象，这是不容忽视的。本署中南分署在“三反”中查出旧司法人员明自行为六家不法奸商所收买，代奸商造假账，偷漏税，有关法律方面的文书，均由明自行代替起草完全成了不法资本家在人民检察机关中的代理人。有些检察机关认为机关内没有旧司法人员或学过旧法的人，就等于没有旧法思想的影响，这也是错误的。个别地方关于检察机关领导问题上的“三权鼎立”思想，就是旧法思想的严重表现。各地有一些检察署不了解人民检察工作在保障国家政策法律执行中的重要作用，不了解检察工作必须为政治服务、为运动服务；错误地认为参加运动不是检察署的业务，只有“写起诉书”，“出庭论告”“检验”等才是检察“业务”；甚至认为检察工作是“可有可无”的司法制度上的陪衬。这在实际上是把人民检察机关当作法院附属物的旧司法制度的观点。也有极少数的检察工作干部引用旧的法律观点办案。如某地检察工作干部，不是根据犯罪事实及其对人民的危害确定罪名，而是抄袭反动的旧法条文，把私设公堂，非法拘禁工人的严重罪行说成是“妨害自由罪”，把某校长奸辱女生，败坏人民教育事业的违法乱纪行为确定为“有伤风化罪”等等。两年多来的人民检察工作虽有一些新的创造和经验，但从整个检察工作的业务方针来说，“做什么？怎样做？”仍是有些地方尚未彻底解决的问题。对于从实际出发、大胆创造、总结经验的思想还不明确，空喊方针不明、业务不熟或作空泛无益的争论，不去从实际中调查研究，总结经验。更有的单纯地强调所谓“正规”的制度、手续，实质上是墨守陈规，只求形式，不求内容，把工作引向狭小的事务主义的圈子，脱离实际，脱离群众。因此，各地人民检察机关必须结合司法改革运动，进行普遍深入的学习，检查业务思想和工作方针，肯定成绩，纠正缺点，总结经验，明确方向。为此，必须展开充分的批评与自我批评。领导干部有旧法观点与旧司法作风的，尤须深刻检讨。对于旧法思想的影响和一般业务工作上的问题，则应加以区别。各地并应根据具体情况，选择典型思想，典型事件，进行分析批判，以提高认识。同时应注意吸收人民法庭工作的丰富经验和某些人民法院在工作上已有的创造，树立工作上的新制度新作风。
    协助各级人民法院积极推动司法改革运动的发展，是各级人民检察机关当前的中心业务之一。过去各地人民检察机关曾经检察了不少错押、错判以及司法人员中坏分子贪赃卖法的案件，这是与法院的组织不纯、思想作风不纯有直接关系的。人民检察机关必须和这些违法现象进行坚决的斗争。在这次司法改革运动中，各地人民检察机关应该根据政府的统一政策方针，吸取已往的经验，发动群众揭发司法人员中坏分子的违法行为，并检察重大的违法判决的案件，结合运动进行严肃的处理。对于典型事件，应广泛宣传，揭露旧法思想的反动本质及其对国家和人民的危害，以推动运动的发展。同时注意吸收这次司法改革运动的经验，对于今后人民检察机关依靠群众进行司法监督工作，将是十分有益的。
