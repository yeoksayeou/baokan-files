    American Bacteriological Warfare Killed Ge Quanshu
    Wu Wenhe
    When I arrived at the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, the deputy political instructor of the company was giving a political lesson. When he talked about "We must be vigilant and be ready to crush any conspiracy of American imperialism," his voice became激愤(ji fen - impassioned and indignant). He asked, "Does everyone remember how Comrade Ge Quanshu was sacrificed?" The soldiers answered in unison, "We will never forget!" In the evening, under the flickering candlelight, the deputy instructor recalled Ge Quanshu again, saying, "In the past, this would be the time for Ge Quanshu to report on the hygiene work of the entire company." Everyone's mood became heavy, and the image of a strong and lively young man appeared in everyone's mind once again.
    On the evening of February 27th, Ge Quanshu and the comrades from the company headquarters had just gone to bed when they heard enemy planes flying low and circling over the station, for about half an hour. They neither fired machine guns nor dropped bombs, which everyone found very strange.
    The next morning, at about nine o'clock, Zheng Fapeng, the military doctor from the battalion clinic, went to the Ninth Company for a routine inspection. As he walked to the Ninth Company's station, he suddenly saw small black spots on the snow by the roadside. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be many brownish-black fleas. The temperature was about five degrees below zero Celsius, and some of the fleas were already frozen and unable to move, while others could still jump four or five inches high. The fleas were scattered over an area of about 150 square meters, with varying densities, the densest areas having about 30 to 50 fleas per square meter. After discovering this situation, Zheng Fapeng reported it to the hygiene team and notified the Ninth Company. After receiving the notification, Ge Quanshu immediately took a squad to eliminate them. In addition to collecting some fleas as specimens, they burned the rest. Subsequently, on February 29th and March 2nd, the Ninth Company discovered two dead rats at the station. The dead rat on March 2nd was discovered by Ge Quanshu and Chen Qingshan, a soldier from the Fifth Squad.
    The crime of American imperialism in spreading fleas angered all the soldiers in the company, and they immediately launched a mass anti-bacteriological warfare campaign. Ge Quanshu actively took the lead in catching rats and killing insects, and he buried all the dead rats he found deeply.
    At two o'clock in the afternoon on March 4th, the entire company gathered for a class. The medic, Sun Zhongwen, did not see Ge Quanshu in the classroom, so he ran to the dugout to look for him. Sun Zhongwen saw Ge Quanshu sleeping there covered with a quilt, his body shivering, and his head burning with a high fever. Sun Zhongwen felt strange: Ge Quanshu was in good health and had never been sick since entering Korea, so how could he suddenly become so ill? After examining him, the military doctor Zheng Fapeng followed the routine for febrile diseases and instructed Sun Zhongwen to quickly isolate the patient.
    On the morning of the 5th, Ge Quanshu's condition gradually worsened, his fever was very high, his face was earth-colored, and he was mentally agitated. In the morning, the clinic called and decided to send him to the regimental hygiene team immediately. Ge Quanshu was still concerned about the company's work. When he was carried onto the stretcher by the nurses, he told Sun Zhongwen to take good care of the company's hygiene work. After Ge Quanshu left, the comrades called the battalion clinic several times to inquire about his condition. The third day
    (7th) In the morning, the regimental hygiene captain called and asked Sun Zhongwen in detail about the course of Ge Quanshu's illness and the initial symptoms. The comrades standing next to the telephone sensed something ominous. When Sun Zhongwen finished reporting, the instructor took the phone and asked, "Is Ge Quanshu better?" The other party said sadly, "He has sacrificed himself!" The instructor and comrades were stunned by this bad news.
    After Ge Quanshu's sacrifice, the medical personnel of the hygiene team immediately extracted ten cc of blood from his heart for examination. After microscopic smear examination, Gram-negative bacilli were found in the heart blood. The hygiene team immediately sent the heart blood specimen to the Volunteer Anti-Epidemic Inspection Team. The inspection team first inoculated the specimen for culture and separation of bacteria, then performed serum reaction and guinea pig inoculation, proving that it was indeed plague bacillus. This test report was signed by Chen Wengui, Doctor of Medicine and Professor of Bacteriology, and Fang Liang, Associate Professor of Bacteriology.
    The Ninth Company immediately implemented emergency isolation and blockade from the afternoon of the 7th, conducting precise inspections and effective preventive measures. The company was unblocked on the 18th, effectively controlling the occurrence of the epidemic.
    Although it has been a full six months since the young medic Ge Quanshu sacrificed himself, his comrades' memories of him are still fresh. He was a good young man loved by all the commanders and fighters of the company, and he was only twenty-one years old when he died. He volunteered to resist America and aid Korea and joined the Volunteer Army. He served as a medic in the company, actively working for the health of the soldiers. During the Fifth Campaign, after he was slightly injured, he braved the artillery fire to rush to the forward positions to rescue the seriously wounded in a timely manner. When the troops were building fortifications, everyone was working on the mountains all day and had no time to wash their clothes. Ge Quanshu and Zhang Qinjiang, the ordnance sergeant of the company headquarters, helped all the soldiers in the company wash more than two hundred sets of clothes in three days. He often cared about the health of his comrades. As soon as he arrived at a new station, he immediately led everyone to improve environmental sanitation, such as building toilets, making spittoons, and digging ditches. He inspected each squad several times a day. If someone called him to see a doctor while he was eating, he would immediately put down his bowl and go to the patient; if the patient's illness was more serious, he would move in with the patient at night to provide care. The soldiers were always willing to discuss any difficulties with him, and some illiterate soldiers often asked him to help write letters home or write replies to the people of the motherland. Usually, he was so cheerful and lively that the soldiers always pulled him on stage to perform a program when the company held a cultural evening.
    American imperialism challenged all mankind and poisoned the young Ge Quanshu with bacteriological warfare. All the commanders and fighters of the company deepened their hatred for American imperialism. At the memorial service, instructor Jiang Tongzhi reported on Ge Quanshu's life and deeds. He said: "American imperialism killed Ge Quanshu with bacteriological warfare. Can people allow this crime against human morality? We swear to continue to stand on the forefront of defending peace, raise vigilance, and fight to the end to completely extinguish the flames of American imperialist bacteriological warfare and defend the safety of mankind!" The soldiers wrote indictments, and they were determined to do a good job in anti-bacteriological warfare, strive for greater victories, and avenge Ge Quanshu! (Xinhua News Agency)

    美国细菌战杀害了葛权书
    吴文和
    我到志愿军某部第九连的时候，该连副政治指导员正在上政治课。他讲到“必须提高警惕，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义的任何阴谋”时，声音变得激愤起来。他问：“大家记得葛权书同志怎样牺牲的吗？”战士们齐声回答：“永远忘不了！”到晚上，副指导员在摇曳的烛光下，又怀念起葛权书，他说：“往常，现在该是葛权书来汇报全连卫生工作情况的时候了。”大家的心情变得沉重起来，一个健壮、活泼的青年形象又一次浮现在每个人的脑海里。
    二月二十七日晚上，葛权书和连部的同志才睡下不久，就听到敌机在驻地上空低飞盘旋，时间约有半小时，既没有打机枪，也没有丢炸弹，大家觉得很奇怪。
    第二天早晨约九点钟，营部门诊所军医郑法鹏照例到九连去巡查。他走到九连驻地时，忽然看到在路旁的雪地上有小黑点，走近一看，原来是许多棕黑色的跳蚤。当时温度在摄氏零下五度，有一些跳蚤已冻得不能跳动，有的则仍能跳四、五寸高。跳蚤散布在约一百五十平方公尺的面积上，疏密不等，稠密的地方每平方公尺约有三十至五十只。郑法鹏发现这一情形后，一面报告卫生队，一面通知九连。葛权书得到通知后，立即带了一个班去扑灭。他们除了收集一部分跳蚤作标本外，其余全部予以烧毁。此后，在二月二十九日和三月二日，九连又在驻地先后发现死鼠两只。三月二日的死鼠，是葛权书和五班战士陈庆山发现的。
    美帝国主义撒布跳蚤的罪行激怒了全连战士，他们马上展开了一个群众性的反细菌战运动。葛权书积极带头捕鼠灭虫，发现的死鼠都由他加以深埋。
    三月四日下午两点钟，全连集合上课。卫生员孙仲文不见葛权书在课堂里，就跑到隐蔽部去找他。孙仲文看见葛权书蒙着被子睡在那里，身子冷得直发抖，头上烧的很厉害。孙仲文感到奇怪：葛权书身体很好，入朝以来从没生过病，现在怎么突然病得这样重呢？军医郑法鹏来诊视后，即按热性病常规，吩咐孙仲文迅速将病人加以隔离。
    五日上午，葛权书的病势逐渐加重，热度很高，脸成土色，精神烦躁不安。上午门诊所来电话，决定立刻将他送团卫生队。葛权书念念不忘连里的工作，他被护理人员抱上担架时，还关照孙仲文要好好照顾连里的卫生工作。同志们在葛权书走后，几次打电话给营部门诊所，打听他的病情。第三天
    （七日）早晨，团卫生队长来电话，向孙仲文详细地询问葛权书得病的经过和开始时的症状。站在电话机旁边的同志们预感到不祥，当孙仲文报告完毕，指导员就接过电话来问：“葛权书好点没有？”对方沉痛地说：“他牺牲了！”指导员和同志们都为这个噩耗呆住了。
    葛权书牺牲后，卫生队医务人员即从他遗体的心脏中抽出十西西血进行检验，经过显微镜涂片检查，即发现心血中含有革兰氏阴性杆菌。卫生队立即将心血标本送交志愿防疫检验队，检验队先将这个标本进行培养和分离的细菌接种，然后又进行血清反应和豚鼠接种，证明确为鼠疫杆菌。在这份检验报告书上署名的是医学博士、细菌学教授陈文贵和细菌学副教授方亮。
    第九连自七日下午起即实行紧急的隔离和封锁，进行精密的检查和有效的预防措施。该连到十八日解除封锁，有效地控制了疫病的发生。
    青年卫生员葛权书牺牲到现在虽然已经整整六个多月了，但战友们对他的回忆却永远是新鲜的。他是全连指挥员、战斗员们所热爱的好青年，死时才二十一岁。他志愿抗美援朝参加了志愿军，在连队任卫生员，积极地为战士们的健康而工作。在第五次战役中，他负了轻伤以后，还冒着炮火跑到前哨阵地将重伤员及时抢救下来。部队在构筑工事时，大家整天在山上劳动，没有时间洗衣服，葛权书就和连部军械上士张钦江在三天内帮全连战士洗了二百多套衣服。他经常地关心同志们的健康，一到新的驻地，马上带动大家改善环境卫生，例如修厕所、做痰盂、挖水沟等等。他每天到各班检查好些次，要是有人在他吃饭时来叫他看病，他就马上放下饭碗去到病人处；要是病人的病比较重，他晚上就搬去和病员住在一起进行护理。战士们有什么困难，也总愿意和他商量，有些不识字的战士常请他帮助写家信或给祖国人民写回信。平常，他是那样的愉快活泼，连里举行文娱晚会，战士们总要拉他上台演个节目。
    美帝国主义向全人类挑战，用细菌战毒害了年青的葛权书，全连指挥员、战斗员更加深了对美帝国主义的仇恨。在追悼大会上，指导员蒋同治报告了葛权书的生平事迹。他说：“美帝国主义用细菌战杀害了葛权书，人们能允许这种违反人类道德的罪行吗？我们宣誓要继续站在保卫和平的最前线，提高警惕，为彻底扑灭美帝国主义细菌战毒焰、为保卫人类的安全而战斗到底！”战士们写了控诉书，他们决心做好反细菌战工作，争取打更大的胜仗，为葛权书报仇！（新华社）
