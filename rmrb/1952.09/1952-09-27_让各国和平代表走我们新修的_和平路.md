Let Peace Delegates from All Countries Walk on Our Newly Built "Peace Road"

To the Editor:

As the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to be held in our capital, more than 300 workers from the Beijing Municipal Road Engineering Office have undertaken the glorious task of building a parking lot and asphalt road in a certain area during the conference. In twenty days, everyone rushed to complete 3,000 square meters of asphalt road and 5,000 square meters of cement road.

Prior to this, the workers were engaged in production competitions for the peaceful construction of the motherland in different positions; after accepting this task, the enthusiasm for production became even higher. They said: The further unity of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions to defend peace will give the war-mongers a greater blow. The workers who were laying the curb stones initially could only lay 50 curb stones per group per day, but later increased to 150. Worker Chang Baoshan also created the "manual hoisting" method, which not only ensured the safety of the workers, but also increased the transportation speed by 40%. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, the workers voluntarily worked overtime on the 22nd. The workers said: Let the peace delegates from all countries come and walk on our newly built "Peace Road"!

    让各国和平代表走我们新修的“和平路”
    编辑同志：在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在我们的首都召开的时候，北京市道路工程事务所三百多工人，担负了修筑在大会期间某地的停车场和炒油路的光荣任务。在二十天中，大家突击完成了三千平方公尺的炒油路和五千平方公尺的洋灰路。
    在这以前，工人们都在不同的岗位上进行着祖国和平建设的生产竞赛；接受这一任务后，生产情绪更加高昂。他们说：亚洲及太平洋区域的人民进一步团结起来保卫和平，将要给战争贩子以更大的打击。打马路牙子的工人开始全组每天只能打五十块道牙子，后来增加到一百五十块。工人常宝山还创造了“人工吊运”法，不但保证了工人的安全，并提高了运输速度百分之四十。为了提前完成任务，工人们在二十二日自动加了夜班。工人们说：让各国的和平代表们来走走我们新修的“和平路”吧！
