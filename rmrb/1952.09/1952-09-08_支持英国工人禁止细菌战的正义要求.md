    Support the Just Demand of British Workers to Ban Bacteriological Warfare
    The British working class, disregarding the suppression by the British right-wing trade union bosses, passed a proposal with a majority of more than 269,000 votes at the 84th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress, demanding that the British government negotiate an international law through the United Nations to prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons. This proposal reflects the peace aspirations of the British working class and the broad masses of the British people, and expresses their determination to oppose the use of bacteriological weapons. This proposal further illustrates that the bloody facts of the American aggressors' violation of international law and the conduct of bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China have been understood by an increasing number of British people and people of the world. All the sophistry and denials of the American aggressors regarding the crimes of bacteriological warfare can no longer deceive anyone. This proposal also shows that all the despicable lies spread by the British ruling group to cover up the American crimes of bacteriological warfare have completely bankrupted in the face of the peace-loving people of Britain.
    The American aggressors openly violated the Geneva Protocol and used bacteriological weapons on a large scale against the people of Korea and China, and have consistently adopted an attitude of sophistry and denial of their crimes, attempting to escape the just condemnation of the people of all countries. Facts have proved that this is futile. As early as March of this year, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team exposed the facts of the American use of bacteriological weapons. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, at its Oslo meeting in April, adopted a letter to the men and women of the world against bacteriological warfare. At the Berlin Special Session of the World Peace Council in early July, a resolution was also passed on ending the Korean War, demanding that all countries ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological warfare methods. Soviet Representative to the United Nations Malik has also continuously exposed the American crimes of violating the Geneva Protocol at the Security Council meetings, and proposed that the Security Council pass a resolution calling on all countries to participate in and ratify this protocol. World-renowned peace figures such as Faji, Johnson, and Wen Youzhang, as well as the broad masses of peace-loving people in various countries, have unanimously confirmed and condemned the American aggressors' crimes of using bacteriological weapons to destroy the Geneva Protocol for the past eight months. Now, the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress has passed a resolution demanding a ban on the use of bacteriological weapons, which is a just action that fully conforms to the interests of the peace-loving people of the world and safeguards the dignity of the Geneva Protocol. This undoubtedly increases the strength of the world's peace-loving people in their struggle against American bacteriological warfare. The peace-loving people of all countries will express their warm welcome and firm support for this.
    The British government is one of the countries that signed and ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and it should have assumed the international obligation to stop the American crimes of bacteriological warfare. However, because the British ruling group has become an accomplice in the American aggression against Korea, disregarding the peace aspirations of the British people, it has always adopted an attitude of covering up the American crimes of bacteriological warfare, and has tried its best to slander the struggle of the people of Korea and China against bacteriological warfare in order to deceive the vast number of peace-loving people in Britain. In July of this year, when Reverend Johnson revealed this crime of the United States among the British people based on the reliable evidence he possessed of the American bacteriological warfare, the British ruling group showed extreme panic and openly carried out vicious slander and persecution against Reverend Johnson. However, the British people's will to love peace cannot be curbed by any reactionary force. The resolution passed by the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress demanding a ban on bacteriological weapons once again confirms this truth. The British government can only free itself from the shackles of the United States by accepting this just demand passed by the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress; otherwise, its policy of following the United States and insisting on covering up for the United States will ultimately lead it to be abandoned by the British people.
    At the conference of the delegation of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations on the 4th of this month, General Nam Il told Harrison: "The people of your so-called allies and the people of your own country are increasingly strongly opposed to you, and they demand an immediate ceasefire. They know that this war of aggression against Korea is unjust. You are suffering the opposition of the people of all countries in the world." This stern warning from General Nam Il precisely illustrates the current embarrassing situation of the American aggressors. Disregarding our warning and the reality facing the United States, Harrison even clamored at the armistice talks on the 4th that he would expand bacteriological warfare in Korea. However, this crime of bacteriological warfare in which the American aggressors massively massacre peace-loving people will only arouse greater anger from the peace-loving people of the world, and make them even more isolated, accelerating their final defeat. The resolution passed by the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress to ban bacteriological weapons clearly pointed out this future to the American aggressors.

### 支持英国工人禁止细菌战的正义要求

    支持英国工人禁止细菌战的正义要求
    英国的工人阶级，不顾英国右翼工会头子们的压制，在英国职工大会第八十四届年会上以二十六万九千余票的多数通过了提案，要求英国政府通过联合国谈判一项国际公法，禁止使用细菌武器。这一个提案，反映了英国工人阶级和英国广大人民的和平愿望，表示了他们坚决反对使用细菌武器的意志。这一个提案更说明美国侵略者违反国际公法、对朝中人民进行细菌战的血腥事实，已经为越来越多的英国人民和世界人民所了解。美国侵略者对于细菌战罪行的一切狡辩抵赖，再也欺骗不了任何人了。这一个提案还说明了英国统治集团为掩饰美国细菌战罪行所散布的一切卑鄙谎言，在英国和平人民的面前彻底破产了。
    美国侵略者公然违背日内瓦议定书，对朝中人民大规模使用细菌武器，并一直对其罪行采取狡辩抵赖的态度，企图逃避世界各国人民的正义指责。事实证明这是徒劳无功的。远在今年三月间，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团便揭露了美国使用细菌武器的事实。世界和平理事会常务委员会在四月间召开的奥斯陆会议，通过了反对细菌战的告世界男女书。七月初世界和平理事会柏林特别会议，又通过关于停止朝鲜战争的决议，要求一切国家批准并遵守禁止使用细菌作战方法的日内瓦议定书。苏联驻联合国代表马立克在安全理事会会议上，更曾不断揭露美国破坏日内瓦议定书的罪行，并提议安全理事会通过决议，号召一切国家参加并批准这个议定书。世界著名的和平人士如法奇、约翰逊、文幼章等以及各国广大和平人民，八个月来莫不一致证实和谴责美国侵略者使用细菌武器破坏日内瓦议定书的罪行。现在英国职工大会年会通过要求禁止使用细菌武器的决议，是完全符合世界和平人民利益、维护日内瓦议定书尊严的正义行动。这无疑增加了世界和平人民反对美国细菌战斗争的力量。各国和平人民对此都将表示热烈的欢迎和坚决的支持。
    英国政府是签字和批准一九二五年日内瓦议定书的国家之一，它本来应该承担制止美国细菌战罪行的国际义务。可是，由于英国统治集团变成了美国侵略朝鲜的帮凶，不顾英国人民的这种和平愿望，一直对于美国细菌战罪行采取掩饰的态度，并极力诬蔑朝中人民反细菌战的斗争，以欺骗英国广大爱好和平的人民。今年七月间，约翰逊教长根据他所掌握的美国细菌战的确实证据，在英国人民中间揭露美国这种罪行的时候，英国统治集团表现了极度的惊惶，并公然对约翰逊教长进行恶毒的诽谤和迫害。但是，英国人民热爱和平的意志，是任何反动力量所遏止不了的。英国职工大会年会通过要求禁止细菌武器的决议，再一次证实了这一真理。英国政府只有接受英国职工大会年会所通过的这一正义的要求，才能摆脱美国的束缚，否则，它的追随美国，并坚持为美国打掩护的政策必将最后使它被英国人民所唾弃。
    在朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团本月四日的大会上，南日将军告哈利逊说：“你们的所谓盟国的人民以及你们本国的人民，正日益强烈地反对你们，他们要求立即停战。他们知道这个侵略朝鲜的战争是非正义的。你们正遭受全世界各国人民的反对。”南日将军这个严正的警告，正说明了今天美国侵略者狼狈万状的处境。哈利逊不顾我方的警告和美国所面对的现实，四日在停战谈判会议上竟又扬言要在朝鲜扩大进行细菌战。可是，美国侵略者这种大规模屠杀和平人民的细菌战罪行，只会激起世界爱好和平人民的更大愤怒，而使它自己更加陷于孤立，加速其最后失败的到来。英国职工大会年会通过了禁止细菌武器的决议，便清楚地向美国侵略者指明了这个前途。
