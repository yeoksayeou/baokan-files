    Welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    People of Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Ceylon, and Other Countries are Actively Preparing
    Vietnam Elects Delegates and Strengthens Publicity
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] The Vietnam Peace Movement Organization and various democratic parties and people's organizations are widely publicizing the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing to the Vietnamese people through various means and are actively carrying out preparations to participate in this conference.
    At a recent enlarged meeting, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace elected Vietnamese representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. These representatives have gone to various provinces to publicize the significance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to the people and to solicit their opinions on peace. The Preparatory Committee for the Vietnamese Delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference publishes daily communiqués to the press and the "Voice of Vietnam" radio station regarding the support of the Vietnamese people for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Propaganda regarding the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was conducted during recent gatherings held throughout the country to commemorate the Vietnamese people's August Revolution.
    The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front has instructed its local organizations to implement the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and to widely publicize the declaration of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Vietnam Democratic Party has launched a signature campaign among the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie to support the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Vietnam Socialist Party has also launched a similar movement among intellectuals. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor has launched a short-term production competition among the working class to welcome the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Other people's organizations have also launched publicity and signature campaigns.
    Many letters and resolutions expressing support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference have been sent to the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace from all liberated areas and enemy-occupied areas of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people are combining their support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with their three major tasks for 1952: striving to annihilate the enemy, crushing the enemy's plot to "use war to support war" and "use Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," and increasing production and practicing economy.
    Burmese People from All Walks of Life Elect Candidate Representatives
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] Yangon News: Under the leadership of the Burma Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Burmese people are actively preparing for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    After more than a month of active preparation, the Burma Committee for the Defense of World Peace has recently elected candidates to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. These candidates were nominated by workers, farmers, youth, women, students, monks, merchants, and cultural, educational, and artistic organizations throughout Burma, as well as local branches of the Burma Committee for the Defense of World Peace. The Burma Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a meeting on August 7 and appointed some official representatives to attend the Peace Conference, including members of parliament, doctors, writers, painters, industrialists, businessmen, and peace movement workers.
    At the same time, peace-loving people in various parts of Burma have enthusiastically launched publicity work to promote the peace movement. On August 5, the Burma Committee for the Defense of World Peace published a special issue entitled "Rise Up to Stop the American Imperialists from Conducting Germ Warfare," which contained important documents such as the appeal to men and women around the world against germ warfare passed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and the report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers on the investigation of germ warfare, as well as photographic evidence of the crimes of the American imperialists in conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. When electing candidates to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the two counties of Mandalay and Myaungmya printed and distributed the declaration passed by the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    Thailand Preparatory Meeting Held in Bangkok
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] Bangkok News: The Thailand Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in Bangkok on August 25. Participants included representatives from workers, farmers, intellectuals, Buddhist monks, and other classes. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Charoon Suksai, who was elected as the chairman of the Thailand Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Mr. Kulai Siprapai, Dharma reader, Phra Thammathut, Samut Phuravet, and Ningnuan Chunlaphon were elected as vice chairmen. The meeting passed several resolutions, one of which called for an immediate cessation of the Korean War and the withdrawal of Thai troops from Korea; another resolution was on the anti-war movement. The meeting also passed resolutions against the rearmament of Japan and for the realization of peace in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya. These resolutions will be submitted to the Thai government, the United Nations, and the World Peace Council. The meeting unanimously decided to send a telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which stated: "Our support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be demonstrated in the struggle for peace. We believe that peace cannot be waited for; all peace-loving people must unite to strive for peace."
    Ceylon Elects Delegation to Attend the Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th] The people of Ceylon have elected a delegation to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing. The delegation includes Buddhist monks, members of parliament, and members of the Colombo Municipal Council.
    Mr. Somgathasan, a member of the All-Ceylon Peace Committee and former vice-chairman of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation, told Xinhua reporters that Ceylon is stepping up preparations for participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. He said that the Ceylon Organizing Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a mass rally at the Colombo City Hall on August 8 to mobilize support for the peace conference. Representatives from various parties spoke at the meeting, expressing their support for the aims of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and guaranteeing to send a representative delegation to attend the conference. At that gathering, Mr. Saranamkara, the Ceylon representative who attended the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing in June, reported on the work of the preparatory meeting and the recent special meeting of the World Peace Council held in Berlin. More than 2,000 people attended the gathering, and the city hall was packed, with people standing even in the corridors. A large part of the audience were Buddhist monks.
    Following this, similar rallies were held in many cities - Kandy and Matara held rallies on August 17 and 23 respectively. In the coming weeks, similar rallies will also be held in Kandy, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Galle and other places.
    Currently, a local patrons committee composed of leading figures from all walks of life in Ceylon has been established. This committee has taken all steps to publicize the significance of this conference. About 25 prominent figures representing various political views in Ceylon, as well as representatives of Buddhism and Christianity, have signed a declaration entitled "Asia Needs Peace," supporting the aims of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and calling on the people of Ceylon to fully support this conference.
    When talking about the situation of the peace movement in Ceylon, Sangathasan said: Since its establishment, the All-Ceylon Peace Committee has held two very successful island-wide peace conferences, mobilizing the people to participate in the movement to support the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and to demand the conclusion of a peace pact between the five major powers. At the same time, the Peace Committee launched a movement against the use of Ceylon's sea, land, and air bases for wars of aggression against other countries.
    One of the characteristics of the Ceylon peace movement is that many Buddhist monks participate in this movement. The presidents of almost all Buddhist academies have signed the declaration banning the use of atomic bombs. One of the secretaries of the Peace Committee and a prominent figure in the peace movement is the important Buddhist monk and nationally renowned scholar, Venerable Dhammaratana.
    He pointed out that the people of Ceylon hope to establish trade relations with the People's Republic of China and believe that such trade relations will contribute to peace in Asia. He said: "The Ceylon peace movement has made the demand for the immediate establishment of trade relations with China one of its slogans."

    许多表示拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的函电和决议，纷纷从越南全国解放区和敌占区各地寄给越南保卫世界和平委员会。越南人民正把拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和他们的一九五二年三大任务——努力歼敌、粉碎敌人的“以战养战”和“利用越南人打越南人”的阴谋、增产节约——结合起来。
    缅甸各界人民选出代表候选人
    【新华社三十一日讯】仰光消息：缅甸人民在缅甸保卫世界和平委员会的领导下，正积极进行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作。

    锡兰选出出席大会的代表团
    【新华社新德里三十日电】锡兰人民已选出代表团出席即将在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。代表中有佛教僧侣、议会议员和科伦坡市议会议员等。
    全锡兰和平委员会委员、前锡兰总工会副主席桑姆加塔桑在接见新华社记者时说，锡兰全国正在加紧进行关于筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的工作。他说，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的锡兰发起委员会于八月八日在科伦坡市政厅举行了一个动员支持和平会议的群众大会，会上各党派代表都曾发言，表示支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的目的，并保证派遣具有代表性的代表团出席会议。在那一次集会上，出席六月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的锡兰代表撒拉南卡拉，就筹备会议的工作以及最近在柏林举行的世界和平理事会特别会议的情况作了报告。参加这次集会的有两千多人，市政厅挤得满满地，连走廊上也站满了人，会众中有很大一部分是佛教僧侣。
    接着，许多城市也举行了类似的大会——科尼加拉和马塔拉分别在八月十七日和二十三日举行大会。今后数周内，康提、耶佛那、亨可马里、加尔等地也将举行这样的大会。
    目前，由锡兰各界领导人物组成的地方赞助人委员会已经成立，这个委员会已采取一切步骤，宣传这次会议的意义。实际上代表着锡兰全国各种政见的约二十五位著名人士以及佛教和基督教的代表，在支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的目的并号召锡兰人民全力支持这个会议的题名“亚洲需要和平”的宣言上签了名。
    桑姆加塔桑在谈到锡兰和平运动的情况时说：全锡兰和平委员会成立以来，曾举行两次非常成功的全岛和平大会，动员了人民参加拥护禁止使用原子武器和要求缔结五大国和平公约的运动。同时，和平委员会并发动了一次运动，反对利用锡兰的海、陆、空军基地进行侵略其他国家的战争。
    锡兰和平运动的一个特点是：很多的佛教僧侣参加了这个运动。佛教学院的院长差不多全都在禁止使用原子弹的宣言上签了名。和平委员会的书记之一及和平运动的一位杰出人物，就是重要佛教僧侣、全国闻名的学者达马拉塔纳法师。
    他指出，锡兰人民希望和中华人民共和国建立贸易关系，并认为这种贸易关系将有助于亚洲和平。他说：“锡兰的和平运动已把立即和中国建立贸易关系的要求作为它的口号之一。”
