    Reply to the Criticism of the Xixian County People's Government's Blind Trust in Unscrupulous Merchants
    Editor: The criticism published in the People's Daily on July 9th by Comrade Yan Yuanzhong and others, regarding the Xixian County People's Government's blind trust in unscrupulous merchants during the repair of the Lixi Bridge, which resulted in poor construction quality and the bridge being washed away, has been investigated by us through inquiries to the Xixian County People's Government. This investigation has proved this criticism is fundamentally correct. The Xixian County People's Government has conducted a review of this issue. Before the bridge repair, the leading cadres of the county only considered the importance of repairing the bridge and did not consider how to avoid wasting state property and ensure the solidity of the project. In addition, they exhibited bureaucratic tendencies, blindly trusting the unscrupulous merchant Yu Shaoshan's technical skills, and considering the project insignificant. They treated the work with an irresponsible attitude, only superficially examining the drawings and then ordering the start of construction. After construction began, they failed to thoroughly inspect the construction site. Under these circumstances, the unscrupulous merchant took the opportunity to cut corners, resulting in the collapse of the bridge. This is indeed a distressing event. The county magistrate and deputy magistrate of Xixian County stated in their review that they will correct this irresponsible work style in future work.

    河南省潢川专员公署
    对息县人民政府盲目信任奸商的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报七月九日刊登鄢元中等同志对息县人民政府在修复李西桥工程中，盲目信任奸商，以致工程质量不好，桥梁被水冲毁的批评，经我们查问息县人民政府，证明这个批评基本上是正确的。息县人民政府已对这个问题进行了检讨。在修桥之先，该县领导干部只单纯考虑修桥重要，而没有考虑如何不浪费国家财产和保证工程坚固。加以他们有官僚主义作风，轻信奸商余少山有技术，同时认为这个工程不大，便以不负责任的态度对待这个工作，当时只粗枝大叶地看了看图样，就叫办理开工，开工后又未深入工地检查。在这种情况下，奸商便乘机偷工减料，以致造成桥身倒塌事件。这确是一件令人痛心的事情。息县正、副县长在检讨中表示今后在工作中一定纠正这种不负责任的作风。  河南省潢川专员公署
