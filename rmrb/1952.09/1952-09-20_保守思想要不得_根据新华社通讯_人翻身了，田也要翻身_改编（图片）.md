    Sixteen. Wang Shugui, following the scientific methods of the county farm, weeded, top-dressed, and irrigated the fields on time. His two younger brothers also worked even more enthusiastically.
    Seventeen. When it came time for heading, the ears on Wang Shugui's "thousand-catty field" emerged earlier and grew longer. The elderly came to see this "strange phenomenon" again.
    Eighteen. At harvest time, people were afraid he was falsely reporting figures. They watched him "ban he" (threshing rice) on the spot. As a result, Wang Shugui threshed 1,625 catties of rice from one mu and six fen of land, equivalent to 1,015 catties of rice per mu. Only then did everyone believe him. Wang Shugui said to everyone, "Conservative thinking is undesirable. We must do as the People's Government tells us. Next year, I will create a new record of 1,500 catties of rice per mu!" Everyone said, "People have been emancipated, so must the land." (The End)

    保守思想要不得

    十六、王树桂又按照县农场的科学方法，按时在田里踩草、追肥、灌水。两个弟弟也干得更有劲了。
    十七、到抽穗时，王树桂的“千斤田”上的穗子抽得又早，长得又长，老年人又来看“怪事”了。
    十八、秋收时，人家怕他虚报数字，当场看他“扮禾”（打稻子），结果王树桂在一亩六分田上扮了一千六百二十五斤稻子，合一亩田产稻一千零十五斤，大家才相信了。王树桂对大家说：“保守思想要不得，我们一定要照人民政府的话去干。明年我还要创造每亩田产水稻一千五百斤的新纪录呢！”大家都说：“人翻身了，田也要翻身。”               （完）
