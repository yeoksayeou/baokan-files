Xinhua News Agency, September 9th—The national industrial products promotion campaign, launched by the state-owned trading system in July, has achieved great success. State-owned trading companies at the level of major administrative regions such as East China, Central South, and Northwest all exceeded their sales plans in July. As large quantities of industrial products were promoted to rural areas, the needs of the vast number of peasant consumers for summer goods were basically met. Now, autumn crops, especially grain and cotton, have begun to enter the market in large quantities, and the purchasing power of farmers will further increase significantly. Therefore, how to closely integrate procurement, expand and organize sources of goods, and strengthen the planning of allocation to ensure adapting to the increasing purchasing power of farmers and meeting their needs for autumn and winter goods is the main issue that the state-owned trading system's industrial product promotion campaign should urgently address at present.

In this industrial products promotion campaign, state-owned trading companies in many regions conscientiously implemented the policy of focusing on wholesale, relying on cooperatives, and uniting private industrial and commercial operators, actively improved wholesale business, and thus exceeded their sales tasks. The Hebei Provincial Department Store established business relationships with more than 1,670 cooperatives in the province, enabling industrial products to be supplied to rural areas in large quantities and in a timely manner. The Yangliuqing Department Store in the Tianjin Special District, due to its close reliance on cooperatives and the establishment of connections with private merchants to expand wholesale business, sold industrial products exceeding the plan by 69 percent in July and more than 120 percent in August. The Northwest District Company of the China Department Store saw its wholesale volume to private merchants account for over 44 percent of the total wholesale volume in July. The East China and Central South major administrative regions recently held price conferences, adjusting regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences for many kinds of commodities. The Shijiazhuang City Department Store in Hebei adjusted the prices of 2,816 kinds of commodities and lowered the wholesale starting point, taking care of the interests of production, transportation, and sales, which will be more beneficial to the development of the industrial product promotion campaign. State-owned trading companies in various regions have also established wholesale relationships with factories, organizations, groups, schools, and other entities. The Shanxi Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company invited the heads of more than 20 factories and mines in Taiyuan to visit the warehouse and establish business relationships with them, so that long-accumulated materials were sold.

The main characteristics of this industrial products promotion campaign are that many trade departments have fully mobilized employees, starting with improving business methods and increasing work efficiency to complete the promotion tasks. After the enthusiasm of the employees was brought into play, they put forward many valuable rationalization proposals, which greatly improved the work. In the preparation stage of the industrial products promotion campaign, state-owned trading companies in various regions relied on the masses of employees to carry out inventory clearance, commodity sorting, and price review, thereby strengthening the planning of commodity allocation. The West Sichuan District Company of the China Department Store cleared its inventory in July and planned its allocation according to the needs of 26 branch companies, thereby changing the past phenomenon of blind allocation. As a result, the sales volume in July increased by more than 41 percent compared with May. Employees of the state-owned trading system in the Northeast have created many good methods and experiences in a series of business operations such as warehouse management, storage and transportation, wholesale, and processing orders. After the employees of the state-owned trading system in the East China region launched the rationalization proposal campaign, the phenomenon of working overtime was basically eliminated, which means that the promotion tasks could be overfulfilled without the need for working overtime. In addition, the state-owned trading systems in various regions have universally strengthened internal business connections and cooperation during the campaign. After the Xikang Provincial Company of the China Department Store launched the promotion campaign, the company's business, planning, storage and transportation, finance, and accounting departments signed contact contracts with each other to work together. In July, the number of accumulated commodities decreased by 44 percent, and the number of goods transferred out increased by one time compared with June. The Henan Provincial Department Store held a joint meeting of branch company managers in late July, carried out internal exchanges, and found sales channels for 56 kinds of commodities with a total value of more than 9 billion yuan from various branch companies.

Now that the peak trading season has arrived, in order to closely cooperate with the procurement tasks and further develop the industrial products promotion campaign, the national state-owned trading system is currently strengthening the planning of material allocation to promote industrial products to the hands of farmers in a timely manner. The main problems that still exist in the campaign are that the development of the campaign is not balanced and in-depth enough, and the state-owned trading units in some regions have not paid enough attention to uniting private merchants to actively improve wholesale business, and the policy of relying on cooperatives and strengthening business relationships with cooperatives is not clear enough. In addition, some state-owned trading units in some regions only pay attention to promotion and ignore the organization of goods sources, and in terms of promotion, they only pay attention to promoting slow-selling products and ignore the wholesale business of main commodities, etc. These problems need to be quickly resolved.

### 全国工业品推销运动有很大成绩  国营贸易系统加强物资调拨计划迎接旺季

    全国工业品推销运动有很大成绩
    国营贸易系统加强物资调拨计划迎接旺季
    【新华社九日讯】全国国营贸易系统的工业品推销运动从七月份开始以来，已获得巨大成绩。华东、中南、西北等大行政区一级的国营贸易公司七月份都超额完成了销货计划。由于大批工业品被推销下乡，基本满足了广大的农民消费者对夏令货物的需要。现在秋季作物、特别是粮食和棉花已开始大量上市，农民购买力更将大大提高，因此，如何紧密地结合收购，扩大与组织货源，加强调拨的计划性，以保证适应农民更加增涨的购买力和满足农民对秋冬货物的需要，这是国营贸易系统工业品推销运动在目前应迫切注意的主要问题。
    在这次工业品推销运动中许多地区的国营贸易公司认真地执行了以批发为主的政策，依靠合作社和团结私营工商业者，积极改进批发业务，因而都超额完成了销货任务。河北省百货公司和省内一千六百七十多个合作社建立了业务关系，使工业品能大量、及时地供应农村。天津专区杨柳青百货公司由于紧密地依靠合作社并与私商建立了联系，扩大批发业务，七月份销出的工业品超过计划百分之六十九，八月份超过计划百分之一百二十以上。中国百货公司西北区公司七月份对私商的批发额，占批发总额百分之四十四强。华东、中南两大行政区最近分别举行了物价会议，调整了许多种商品的地区差价、批发和零售差价。河北石家庄市百货公司调整了二千八百十六种商品的价格，并降低了批发起点，照顾产运销三方面的利益，这对于工业品推销运动的开展将更加有利。各地国营贸易公司也和工厂、机关、团体、学校等建立了批发关系。中国工业器材公司山西分公司曾邀请太原市二十多个工厂、矿场的负责人参观仓库，和他们建立业务关系，因而使长期积压的物资都得到了销路。
    这次工业品推销运动的主要特点是：许多贸易部门都充分地发动职工，从改进经营方法、提高工作效率入手来完成推销任务。职工群众的积极性发挥出来以后，提出许许多多有价值的合理化建议，大大地改善了工作。在工业品推销运动的准备阶段中，各地国营贸易公司都依靠职工群众进行了清理仓库、商品排队、复查牌价等工作，从而加强了商品调拨的计划性。中国百货公司川西区公司七月份清理了库存物资，根据二十六个支公司的需要，有计划地加以调配，因而改变了过去盲目调拨的现象，七月份售货额就比五月份增加百分之四十一以上。东北国营贸易系统的职工在仓库保管、储运、批发、加工定货等一系列的业务工作中，创造出不少好的办法和经验。华东区国营贸易系统职工开展合理化建议运动以后，基本上消灭了加班加点的现象，这就是说，不必用加班加点的方法，推销任务也能超额完成了。此外，各地国营贸易系统在运动中普遍加强了内部的业务联系和配合。中国百货公司西康省公司开展推销运动后，公司内的业务、计划、储运、财务、会计等部门互相签订了联系合同，协同工作，七月份商品积压数量就减少了百分之四十四，调出货物的数量比六月份增加了一倍。河南省百货公司在七月下旬召开各支公司经理联席会议，展开内部交流，使各支公司总值九十亿元以上的五十六种商品都找到了销路。
    现在，贸易的旺季已经来临，为了紧密配合收购任务，进一步开展工业品推销运动，全国国营贸易系统目前正在加强物资调拨的计划性，把工业品及时推销到农民手里。现在运动中还存在的主要问题，是运动发展还不够平衡和深入，某些地区的国营贸易单位对团结私商积极改进批发业务还注意得不够，对依靠合作社，加强和合作社的业务关系的方针不够明确；另有一些地区的国营贸易单位只注意推销而忽视货源的组织，在推销方面，只注意推销滞销品而忽视了主要商品的批发业务等等。这些问题都需要迅速加以解决。
