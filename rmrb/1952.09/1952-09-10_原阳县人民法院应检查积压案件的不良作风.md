    The People's Court of Yuanyang County Should Examine the Bad Work Style of Accumulating Cases

    Editor: The People's Court of Yuanyang County, Pingyuan Province, is slow and procrastinating in handling cases, which has added much suffering to the people. It is hoped that this can be corrected in the current judicial reform movement.

    For example, a woman from Dawangzhuang Village in the county requested a divorce. She ran to the court many times before the court granted the divorce and allowed her to take away four mu of land. However, the man harvested the wheat grown on these four mu of land. The woman then filed a complaint with the court, running back and forth more than thirty times, but it has not been resolved for several months. The court has received more than 600 letters of accusation and complaints from the masses in the past three years, but has only handled more than 100 of them. If this old judicial work style, which is divorced from the masses, is not thoroughly corrected, it will be difficult to talk about protecting the interests of the people. It is hoped that the staff of the court will thoroughly examine and correct this in the current judicial reform movement.

    原阳县人民法院应检查积压案件的不良作风
    编辑同志：平原省原阳县人民法院处理案件迟缓拖延，给人民增加了许多痛苦，希望能在这次司法改革运动中加以纠正。
    如该县大王庄村一妇女要求离婚，她往法院跑过好多次，法院才判准，并判准她带走四亩地。但这四亩地种的麦子被男方收割去了，这个妇女又向法院控告，先后跑了三十多次，一直拖了几个月也没有解决。该院三年来共收到群众检举和控告信六百多件，仅处理了一百余件。这种脱离群众的旧司法作风如再不彻底纠正，就很难谈到保护人民利益了。希望该院工作人员在这次司法改革运动中彻底检查纠正。
