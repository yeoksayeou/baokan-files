    Welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Dong Shouyi, Member of the All-China Sports Federation, Member of the International Olympic Committee
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which is closely followed by peace-loving people all over the world, is about to open in Beijing. As an ordinary Chinese person, I feel infinitely honored, and I warmly welcome this major event with unparalleled excitement, and express my sincere respect and congratulations to the conference.
    The noble purpose and important mission of this conference have been declared to the world in the initiation letter and the declaration of the preparatory meeting. I believe that with the close unity of the peace envoys representing the common will of more than 1.6 billion people, this conference will be able to successfully complete its sacred task.
    The Chinese people have always been peace-loving and are willing to live in peace with the people of other countries in the world. For more than a hundred years, the Chinese nation has been a nation subjected to aggression. Only after the birth of New China did the Chinese people begin to embark on the road of peaceful construction. The Chinese people deeply feel the preciousness of peace. However, the destroyers of peace have ignited the flames of aggressive war in Korea, and under the support of the United States, the militarist forces of Japan are beginning to revive. The Chinese people and the people of other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are simultaneously facing a serious threat of war, and peace is in danger. But peace is the urgent demand of the people all over the world. As long as the peace-loving people of the world are closely united and act in unison, peace can be saved. Therefore, this conference represents the requirements of human reason and justice, and demonstrates the great power of the people of this region to defend peace. Although the delegates represent different nationalities, come from different countries, and have different political views and religious beliefs, they all hold the common aspiration of defending peace. The peace plan formulated at this meeting will surely make a significant contribution to the cause of world peace.
    Chinese sports workers warmly support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the development of economy and culture and the improvement of people's living standards, people's sports activities have achieved unprecedented development. Sports workers and athletes of New China firmly believe that different social systems can coexist peacefully, and different social systems should carry out peaceful competition and conduct economic and cultural exchanges with each other. We Chinese sports workers are willing to strengthen international sports activities with athletes and sports workers from various countries, exchange experiences in sports, and promote friendship and understanding among the people of all countries, so as to contribute to the cause of world peace.
    We wish the conference success. Long live peace!

    迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    中华全国体育总会委员  国际奥林匹克委员会委员  董守义
    全世界酷爱和平的人民密切关怀的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议快要在北京开幕了。作为一个普通的中国人，我感到无限的光荣，我以无比兴奋的心情热烈欢迎这一件大事，并且表示我对于大会的诚恳敬意和庆贺。
    这个会议的崇高目的和重大使命，在发起书上及筹备会议的宣言里已经宣示于全世界。我相信，在代表着十六亿以上人民共同意志的和平使者们密切团结之下，这次会议将可以圆满地完成它的神圣任务。
    中国人民一贯酷爱和平，愿意同世界上其他国家的人民和平共处。一百多年来，中华民族是一个被侵略的民族。只有新中国诞生之后，中国人民才开始走上和平建设的道路。中国人民深深感到和平的可贵。但是和平破坏者又在朝鲜燃点起侵略战火，在美国扶植之下，日本的军国主义势力正开始复活。中国人民和亚洲及太平洋区域其他国家的人民同时受到了战争的严重威胁，和平处在危险中。但是和平是全世界人民的迫切要求，只要全世界爱好和平人民密切团结和行动一致，和平是可以拯救的。所以这个会议是代表着人类理性和正义的要求，是显示本区域人民保卫和平的伟大力量。各位代表们虽代表着不同民族，来自不同国度，具有不同政治见解和不同的宗教信仰，但都抱着保卫和平的共同志愿。在这个会上所拟订的保卫和平方案，必将对世界和平事业作出重大的贡献。
    中国的体育工作者热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。中华人民共和国成立三年来，由于经济和文化的发展以及人民生活水准的提高，人民的体育活动已有空前的发展。新中国的体育工作者和运动员深信不同的社会制度可以和平共存，不同的社会制度应该展开和平竞赛并相互进行经济往来，文化交流。我们中国体育工作者愿与各国的运动员与体育工作者共同加强国际间的体育活动，交流体育运动的经验，促进各国人民之间的友谊和谅解，以便有助于世界和平的事业。
    我们预祝大会的成功。和平万岁！
