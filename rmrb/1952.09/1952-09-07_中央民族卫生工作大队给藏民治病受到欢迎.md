    Central National Health Work Team's Treatment of Tibetan People Receives Warm Welcome
    Editor: In May of this year, when we were in Daofu, Xikang, one moonless night, the sky was pitch black, and the comrades were sound asleep. Suddenly, an urgent knocking on the door startled us awake. Listening carefully, a Tibetan woman speaking Chinese was urgently shouting, "Health team, open the door quickly, a fellow villager is giving birth!" Wang Zhentai and three other midwifery comrades immediately got up, not even having time to put on their socks, just throwing on their coats, grabbed the delivery kit, and followed the Tibetan woman who had called them, running as fast as they could.
    After passing through several winding alleys and entering a walled courtyard, the cry of a newborn infant grew louder. We quickly entered a small flat, where the dim light illuminated the pale face of the mother, Meimei. Meimei had collapsed on the ground (Tibetan women here do not give birth in bed). The infant in the bed was crying incessantly, and Meimei's husband was squatting beside her, frowning. When he saw the midwifery comrades enter, he immediately came over and said something in Tibetan. The Tibetan woman who brought us translated, "He says he is sorry to bother you so early in the morning, but Meimei is bleeding too much and has fainted. Please save her!" The midwifery comrades, while saying, "Don't be polite, don't be polite," immediately helped Meimei onto the bed, injected a cardiac stimulant, and performed artificial respiration. After a tense quarter of an hour, Meimei slowly woke up and opened her eyes. Everyone then rearranged the baby properly, cleaned the mother, and helped her lie on the bed to rest; they also cooked a bowl of "poached eggs" for her to eat. They also told her some postpartum knowledge... After everything was settled, they took Meimei's blood-stained clothes back to the team to wash.
    The next day, when the midwifery comrades brought back the clean clothes, Meimei and her husband were very grateful. Meimei said, "Thanks to you for saving me last night, otherwise I would have died; you even washed my dirty things, you are so kind to me." The midwifery comrades said, "It's all because we now have Chairman Mao!"

    中央民族卫生工作大队给藏民治病受到欢迎
    编辑同志：今年五月间，我们在西康道孚的时候，一个没有月亮的夜里，天漆黑，同志们正熟睡着。忽然一阵紧急的敲门声惊醒了我们，定神听时，是一位操着汉语的藏族妇女急速地喊着：“卫生大队，快开门，有老乡生娃娃了！”王珍台等三位助产同志连忙起床，袜子也来不及穿，只把上衣披上，提了接生箱，跟着喊门的藏族妇女拔腿就跑。
    穿过几条弯曲小巷进入一道围墙时，一个初生婴儿的啼哭声由远而近了。我们很快进到一个小平房内，只见室内暗暗的灯光，照在产妇美梅的苍白的脸上。美梅昏倒在地上了（这里藏民妇女生产不在床上）。床上的婴儿在不停地哭着，美梅的丈夫蹲在她身旁皱着眉头。当他看见助产同志进去时，立刻走过来说了些藏话。带我们跑来的藏族妇女翻译说：“他说对不起你们，天不亮就把你们请来了，美梅流血过多，昏过去了，救救命吧！”助产同志们一边说着“不要客气，不要客气”，一边动手将美梅抬到床上，注射强心剂，施行人工呼吸法。紧张地经过一刻钟以后，美梅才慢慢地苏醒过来了，睁开了眼睛。大家又把婴儿重新料理妥当，把产妇身上洗干净，使她在床上躺着休息；又煮了一碗“荷包蛋”给她吃。并告诉她产后的一些常识，……。一切都安顿之后，就将美梅的染了很多血的衣服带回队里洗涤。
    第二天，助产同志们把洗干净的衣服送去的时候，美梅和她的丈夫非常感激。美梅说：“昨晚幸亏你们救我，不然我就死了；你们还给我洗脏东西，你们对我真是太好了。”助产同志说：“只因为现在我们有了毛主席啊！”
