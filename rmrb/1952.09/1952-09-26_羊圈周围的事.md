    Things Around the Sheepfold
    By our correspondent Shen Shi
    In mid-July, Comrade Ji Rumu Tu of the New Barag Left Banner (referred to as East New Barag Banner) and I were traveling from Xinboluosuomu (a "Suomu" is equivalent to a district) to Jifulangtu Suomu. Passing a Mongolian yurt, Ji Rumu Tu waved his horse whip, pointed to the sheepfold next to the yurt, and said to me, "Guess how many sheep that sheepfold can hold?" I looked carefully for a while, it was about six or seven zhang in diameter, and replied, "At most 800 sheep." Ji Rumu Tu stared and said, "You really are from Beijing! Such a big sheepfold can hold at least 2,000 sheep." The owner, Bateer Zhabu, came out. After we greeted him, Ji Rumu Tu told him about our guessing game. Bateer Zhabu smiled and said to Ji Rumu Tu, "If you had said that five years ago, you would have been right. What's in front of my house now is not the sheepfold that used to hold 2,000 sheep five years ago, it now holds more than 5,000 sheep." His cheerful answer reminded me of the tragic past that many Mongolian herdsmen had told me about.
    During the Japanese imperialist occupation of Inner Mongolia, on the Hulunbuir grasslands, in the Horqin grasslands and the Ujimqin grasslands, how many Mongolian herdsmen had cried leaning against their sheepfolds. What were they crying about? The Japanese Kwantung Army shot their husbands and also robbed them of the cattle and sheep they depended on for a living. In those difficult years, the herdsmen watched their cattle and sheep decrease day by day, lamenting every day, "When will we see the sheepfold stop shrinking year after year? When will we see it expand year after year?" In 1938, the four banners of the Hulunbuir grasslands had more than 1.52 million head of livestock; by 1945, these livestock had decreased to more than 500,000 head. The herdsmen felt as if their hearts were being cut when they saw the unfortunate fate of their beloved livestock! However, the Soviet Red Army came, Chairman Mao's troops came, and the sheepfolds also stood up and changed their appearance. Now, the herdsmen of the New Barag Right Banner (referred to as West New Barag Banner) have an average of 93 head of livestock per person, and the Dalainuoer Suomu of the West New Barag Banner has an average of 145 head per person. Herdsmen no longer cry in front of the sheepfold. In just a few years, the sheepfold has, like the storyteller playing the horsehead fiddle sings, "Turned lucky." The days that the herdsmen had long been waiting for, "expanding year after year," have finally arrived.
    Daxi Deligeler of the Baiyin Hada Suomu in the Chen Barag Banner once had more than 1,000 sheep. After years of looting by the Japanese fascist bandits, by 1945, none of these sheep remained. After the victory against Japan in 1946, he bought 140 sheep. But Daxi Deligeler, like many herdsmen with livestock at that time, began to worry when he heard some rumors. He was afraid that people without livestock would come and divide his cattle and sheep. He thought all day long: Should these sheep be sold? Or should they be slaughtered? Later, Ji Ya Tai, the secretary of the CPC Huna League Local Committee (now the ambassador of our country to the Mongolian People's Republic), repeatedly explained to the herdsmen that there would be "no division and no struggle" in the pastoral areas, and the herdsmen were reassured. By this year, Daxi Deligeler's sheepfold was already filled with more than 1,500 sheep.
    Xinboluosuomu of the East New Barag Banner is a relatively large Suomu in the Hulunbuir grasslands, with more than 230,000 head of livestock. Last year there was a drought, and the grass in the East New Barag Banner did not grow well. The Huna League People's Government instructed the herdsmen of Xinboluosuomu to move to the Arimuchang pasture in the Chen Barag Banner. When the herdsmen first heard that they were going to move to another banner, some were afraid of the long distance, some were worried that the water and grass there would not be good, and some were afraid that the herdsmen of the Chen Barag Banner would treat them as outsiders. Some herdsmen in Chen Barag Banner were also worried that the migration of herdsmen from Xinboluosuomu would affect the fodder for livestock in their own banner. After patient explanations from cadres from both banners, both sides dispelled their ideological concerns, and the herdsmen of Xinboluosuomu finally migrated to the designated location. The Arimuchang pasture, which had not been used for many years, was now teeming with large herds of sheep, cattle, and horses. There was plenty of water and good grass here, and the land was not lacking in alkali. Purubu, the head of the Chen Barag Banner, personally settled them, and the herdsmen of the Chen Barag Banner held meetings to welcome them, dispelling their worries. After last winter and this spring, the livestock grew particularly fat and strong. The herdsmen of Chen Barag Banner drew some manpower to shear wool and receive lambs for the herdsmen of Xinboluosuomu, earning wages, and grazed more than 10,000 sheep on their behalf, fully utilizing the wool and ewe's milk. When the herdsmen of Xinboluosuomu wanted to move this early summer, both the hosts and guests were reluctant to leave. In the past, there had been deep divisions between banners in the Hulunbuir grasslands, and people from one banner could not graze in another banner. People from one banner who passed through another banner were often forced to dismount, had a saddle put on their backs, and were humiliated. If a camel from one Suomu walked to another Suomu, the camel hair was often plucked clean. Today, the divisions between banners have been eliminated. Pastures are unified and regulated, and herdsmen can graze freely.
    When Xinboluosuomu moved to Chen Barag Banner last winter, the Hailar River froze, and livestock could pass smoothly. This summer, when they were about to move back to East New Barag Banner, the Hailar River was very deep, and there was only one bridge for more than 230,000 head of livestock to cross. The herdsmen were very worried that the livestock would be damaged when crossing the bridge and the China Chang Railway. Gu Wei, the secretary of the CPC Huna League Local Committee, and others learned of this situation and immediately sent special personnel. The Hailar Municipal People's Government and the Huna League Public Security Bureau also dispatched cadres to help the herdsmen's livestock cross the bridge. Pengsike Daxi, the head of the East New Barag Banner, and Wang Dege, the director of the banner women's federation, also rushed from hundreds of miles away. The day before the livestock crossed the bridge, the yurt of the Suomu government was moved to the side of the bridge, and the Suomu government installed a telephone to contact the Hailar Railway Station to prevent the livestock from being crushed by trains when crossing the railway. Wooden boards were erected on both sides of the bridge to prevent the livestock from falling into the river when crossing the bridge. After four days and four nights, all the livestock safely returned to the East New Barag Banner. This matter quickly spread in the Hulunbuir grasslands, and the herdsmen were moved to tears.
    In the past, livestock in the Hulunbuir grasslands often suffered from wolf attacks. Packs of wolves could swagger from the Kerulen River to the Sydney River, and stroll from the northern foothills of the Lesser Khingan Mountains to the Ergune River. In winter, on nights with strong winds and heavy snow, wolf packs often raided sheepfolds, dragging away lambs and biting adult sheep to death, causing major damage to the lives of the herdsmen. The herdsmen knew that the sheep had been eaten by wolves and thought it was "destined." They said:
    "Don't kill the wolves, wolves are heavenly dogs, and you will be retaliated against if you kill them." When catching wolf pups, they only cut the tendons in the hind legs for fear of retaliation from the mother wolf. But the lame wolves would still sneak into the sheepfold and cause trouble. The local people's government has thought of many ways to overcome the wolf disaster, educating the herdsmen ideologically, and launching a widespread wolf hunting campaign among the herdsmen. Today, there are fewer wolves, and fewer incidents of wolves eating cattle, sheep, and horses. Yesterday's heavenly dog has become today's target of public criticism.
    Infectious diseases of livestock have also been a major disaster for herdsmen. In the past, when diseases such as anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, and lung plague were prevalent in pastoral areas, herdsmen could only watch their beloved cattle and sheep die in groups, with no way to help. In 1948, more than 21,000 head of livestock died in the East New Barag Banner. Later, veterinarians from the People's Government came to the Hulunbuir grasslands, gave livestock vaccinations, and told the herdsmen to regularly clean the sheepfolds and isolate sick livestock. In recent years, the number of livestock deaths due to illness has been greatly reduced. The herdsmen said, "In the past, when people got sick, they could only burn incense and chant scriptures, and no one would diagnose or treat them. Today, even livestock are given injections!" How grateful they are to their People's Government!
    In Hatenheshuo Baqa, Baiyin Hada Suomu, Chen Barag Banner, the banner People's Government lent 400 sheep to Huhe Tailer and other four herding families to help them organize. Some beat sheep grass, some grazed cattle and sheep, and some engaged in sideline occupations. They pulled wood from the Greater Khingan Mountains and cut willow branches from the banks of the Hailar River to make strong sheepfolds to withstand blizzards. Under the advocacy of the banner People's Government, seasonal mutual aid groups for wintering, springing, and receiving lambs have been generally established in the grasslands. The People's Government lends soybean cakes to herdsmen every year and calls on herdsmen to beat more sheep grass so that livestock can spend the severe winter safely and reduce the losses caused by natural disasters.
    When the notice of the People's Government's collection of animal husbandry tax reached the Hulunbuir grasslands in late August this year, the herdsmen took a positive attitude of support and endorsement. They said: "Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water. Let's choose the fattest cattle and sheep and the best horses to pay taxes!" In just a few days, the herdsmen of the four banners in the grasslands paid all the public animals they should pay.
    The autumn of the Hulunbuir grasslands is dressed in pale yellow new clothes. Mushrooms grow everywhere. Men are busy beating sheep grass, women are busy drying milk curd and picking up cow dung. In the early morning, herds of cattle and sheep walk out slowly, and in the evening they come back full. Lambs and calves have grown up, and sheep are so fat that they can't walk. No, this is not autumn, this is exactly when spring is warm and flowers are blooming.

    羊圈周围的事
    本报记者  沈石
    七月中旬，我和新巴尔虎左翼旗（简称东新巴旗）的吉儒木图同志一道，从辛波洛索木（索木相当于区）前往吉佛朗图索木。路过一个蒙古包，吉儒木图挥着马棒，指着蒙古包旁边的羊圈对我说：“你猜一猜，那个羊圈装多少羊？”我仔细看了一阵，它直径约六、七丈，便回答说：“最多装八百只。”吉儒木图睁着眼说：“你真是从北京来的！这么大的羊圈，至少装两千只羊。”主人巴特尔扎布出来了，我们向他问好以后，吉儒木图告诉他关于我们猜羊圈的情形。巴特尔扎布笑了一笑，对吉儒木图说：“如果你在五年前说这一句话，就对了。现在摆在我家跟前的，不是五年以前装两千只羊的羊圈了，它已经装了五千多只羊。”他的愉快的回答，使我想起许多蒙族牧民对我讲过的悲惨的往日。
    日本帝国主义侵占内蒙古期间，在呼伦贝尔草原上，在科尔沁草原和乌珠穆沁草原上，多少蒙族牧民曾经倚着羊圈哭泣过。他们哭什么？日本关东军枪杀了他们的丈夫，还抢走了他们依以为生的牛羊。在那苦难的年月，牧民们眼看着牛羊一天天减少，每天在悲叹：“什么时候才能看到羊圈不再一年年缩小？什么时候才能看到它一年年扩大呢？”一九三八年，呼伦贝尔草原四个旗有一百五十二万多头牲畜；到一九四五年，这些牲畜减少到五十多万头。牧民们看到自己心爱的牲畜的不幸下场，真是心如刀割呵！然而，苏联红军来了，毛主席的队伍来了，羊圈也翻身了，变样了。现在，新巴尔虎右翼旗（简称西新巴旗）的牧民每人平均有了九十三头牲畜，西新巴旗达赉诺尔索木每人平均有了一百四十五头。牧民们再也不到羊圈跟前哭泣了。短短几年内，羊圈就像拉马头琴的说书人所唱的“交起好运”来了。牧民们久久盼望着的“一年年扩大”的日子，终于到来了。
    陈巴尔虎旗白音哈达索木的达西德力格勒，曾经有过一千多只羊。经过日本法西斯匪徒连年的劫掠，到一九四五年，这些羊一只也没有了。到抗日胜利后的一九四六年，他又买了一百四十只羊。但是达西德力格勒那时候和许多有牲畜的牧民一样，听到一些谣言，便发愁起来。他害怕没有牲畜的人会来分自己的牛羊。他成天地打算：这些羊卖了好呢？还是杀掉好呢？以后，中共呼纳盟地方委员会书记吉雅泰（现任我国驻蒙古人民共和国大使）等反复向牧民说明在牧业区“不分不斗”，牧民们便安心了。到今年，达西德力格勒的羊圈已经装了一千五百多只羊。
    东新巴旗辛波洛索木是呼伦贝尔草原比较大的一个索木，它有着二十三万多头牲畜。去年天旱，东新巴旗草长得不好，呼纳盟人民政府指示辛波洛索木牧民移往陈巴尔虎旗的阿日牧场。牧民们初听到要移往别的旗时，有的怕路远，有的担心那里水草不好，有的怕陈巴尔虎旗的牧民把他们当作外人看待。而陈巴尔虎旗的某些牧民也担心辛波洛索木牧民移来后将影响本旗牧畜的饲料。经过两旗的干部耐心解释，双方思想顾虑都打消了，辛波洛索木的牧民终于向指定地点迁移了。多年来没有被利用过的阿日牧场，出现了大批的羊群、牛群和马群。这里水多草好，地里的碱也不缺乏，陈巴尔虎旗旗长普鲁布亲自安置他们，陈巴尔虎旗的牧民开会欢迎他们，他们的顾虑消释了。经过去年冬天和今年春天，牲畜长得特别肥壮。陈巴尔虎旗的牧民抽出一部分人力，给辛波洛索木的牧民剪羊毛，接羊羔，得到了工资，并代牧了一万多只羊，充分使用了羊毛和羊奶。今年夏初，辛波洛索木的牧民要移动时，主客双方都舍不得离开。过去，呼伦贝尔草原上旗与旗之间曾经有过很深的隔阂，这一旗的人不能到别的旗去放牧。这旗的人路经别的旗，往往被强迫下马，背上被套上马鞍，受人侮辱。这一索木的骆驼走到另一索木，驼毛往往被拔得精光。今天，旗与旗间的隔阂消释了。牧场统一调剂，牧民们可以自由放牧了。
    辛波洛索木在去年冬季移往陈巴尔虎旗的时候，海拉尔河结了冰，牲畜可以顺利通行。今年夏季他们要搬回东新巴旗时，海拉尔河水很深，二十三万多头牲畜只有一座桥可走。牧民们很担心牲畜过桥和过中长铁路时会受到损失。中共呼纳盟地方委员会书记古韦等知道了这一情况，立刻派出专人，海拉尔市人民政府和呼纳盟公安局也调出干部，帮助牧民的牲畜过桥。东新巴旗旗长朋斯克达西、旗妇女联合会主任汪德格，也从几百里路外赶来。在牲畜过桥的前一天，索木政府的蒙古包移到桥边，索木政府安装了电话，和海拉尔车站联系，以免牲畜过铁路时被火车压死。桥两侧竖起木板，以免牲畜过桥时掉落河中。经过四天四夜，全部牲畜安然回到东新巴旗。这事在呼伦贝尔草原很快传开了，牧民们感动得掉下泪来。
    过去，呼伦贝尔草原上的牲畜时常遭受狼的危害。成群的狼可以大摇大摆地从克鲁仑河旅行到悉尼河，从小兴安岭北麓漫步到额尔古纳河。冬天，大风大雪的夜里，狼群时常袭入羊圈，拖走小羊，咬死大羊，造成牧民生活上的重大损害。牧民知道羊被狼吃掉了，认为是“命中注定”。他们说：
    “不要打狼，狼是天狗，打了会受到报复。”捉到小狼时，因怕母狼报复，只将后腿的筋割断。但跛着脚的狼仍然会溜进羊圈来作乱。当地人民政府为克服狼患，曾经想了许多办法，从思想上教育牧民，并发动牧民开展广泛的打狼运动。今天，狼已经减少了，狼吃掉牛羊和马的事也少了。昨天的天狗，今天成了众矢之的。
    牲畜传染病，也曾是牧民们的大灾祸。过去，当炭疽、口蹄和肺疫等疫病在牧区流行时，牧民只能眼望着可爱的牛羊一群群地死去，一点办法没有。一九四八年，东新巴旗曾病死二万一千多头牲畜。以后，人民政府的兽医到了呼伦贝尔草原，给牲畜进行防疫注射，告诉牧民要经常打扫羊圈，隔离病畜。几年来，牲畜因病死亡的数字大大减少了。牧民们说：“过去，人病了也只有焚香念经，没人给诊治。今天，连牲畜也给打针了！”他们是怎样感激自己的人民政府啊！
    在陈巴尔虎旗白音哈达索木哈腾和硕巴嘎，旗人民政府曾以四百只羊贷给胡和泰勒等四户牧民，帮助他们组织起来，有的打羊草，有的牧牛羊，有的搞副业。他们从大兴安岭拉来了木材，从海拉尔河边割来了柳条，做成坚固的羊圈，抵挡暴风雪。在旗人民政府倡导下，草原普遍成立了过冬、过春、接羊羔等季节性的互助组。人民政府每年贷给牧民豆饼，号召牧民多打羊草，使牲畜可以安度严冬，减少自然灾害所造成的损失。
    今年八月下旬，人民政府征收牧业税的通知传到呼伦贝尔草原时，牧民们采取了积极支持和拥护的态度，他们说：“喝水不忘掘井人。挑最肥的牛羊和最好的马来交税吧！”短短几天内，草原上四个旗的牧民就全部交齐了应交的公畜。
    呼伦贝尔草原的秋天，披上了淡黄色的新装。蘑菇到处丛生着。男人们忙着打羊草，妇女们忙着晒奶干，拾牛粪。清早，牛群羊群缓缓地走出去，傍晚吃得饱饱地走回来。羊羔牛犊长大了，绵羊胖得走不动路。不，这不是秋天，这正是春暖花开的时候。
