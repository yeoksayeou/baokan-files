To build the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway in the continuous, towering Lushan Mountains, which rise more than 3,000 meters above sea level, it was necessary to excavate tunnels with a total length of more than 20 li in the midst of thousands of mountains. These tunnels, one after another, some of which were several li long. Some of these tunnels were all hard rock; some of the rock was brittle—just as one side was cleared, the other side collapsed, causing great difficulties for the project; some tunnels were filled with water and slurry, and excavating them meant fighting against the spring water.

The difficulties were not limited to this.

Building railways on the Northwest Plateau also required a serious struggle against the crisscrossing rivers and deep, perilous ravines. The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway has a total of more than 1,000 bridges and culverts, of which more than 60 bridges and culverts have a length of eight li. Some of these bridges are dozens of meters deep, built between steep canyons; some are on the turbid Wei River, shuttling back and forth like shuttles on the beaches of the Wei River.

Opening tunnels and building bridges required millions of tons of cement and steel beams; every rail and every sleeper needed for the roadbed had to be transported across thousands of mountains and rivers from the distant Northeast, North China, and South to this place where even people found it difficult to walk.

Within the hundred or so li from Longxi to Dingxi on the Tianshui-Lanzhou line is a bitter water and waterless zone, sparsely populated and unable to support good plant growth. Water for drinking and for making cement had to be transported from far away. Tens of thousands of people worked here, but the local area could not even supply vegetables and firewood, and grain had to be purchased from Xi'an and Baoji.

There were many difficulties, and all of them were very serious. However, the people's desire to build a railway here was extremely urgent.

Our country's Northwest is rich in oil like a sea, and oil is to industry as blood is to a person. However, due to traffic congestion, machinery for oil extraction could not be transported, and large-scale extraction projects could not be carried out. Even the oil that had already been extracted could not be quickly transported to the whole country. Transporting it by truck consumed a quarter of the oil transported. If a railway were built from Tianshui to Lanzhou, oil could be transported from Lanzhou to all parts of the country, and various machines for oil extraction could be directly transported to Lanzhou and then transferred to the work site. Some coal mines in Gansu currently have coal costs that are twice as high as machine-extracted coal due to a lack of machinery. The wool textile factory and tannery being built in Lanzhou are waiting for trains to help them quickly transport the machines. The completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway will make an invaluable contribution to accelerating our country's industrialization.

Lanzhou is the hub of trade between the ethnic minorities of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces and the interior. However, due to the high mountains and long roads, some places can only use yaks as the only means of transportation, so the minority compatriots there cannot sell more of their surplus cattle, sheep, and furs. Labrang is the largest distribution center for furs in Gansu, but due to inconvenient transportation, the wool and fur from the Amdo Tibetan area cannot be fully transported. From Xining to Lanzhou is only 234 kilometers, but currently, the state-owned trading company has a backlog of 600,000 to 700,000 jin of wool every day. Danggui from the Tao River basin and wolfberries from Ningxia also urgently need to find a way out. If there is a railway from Tianshui to Lanzhou, a large number of trucks running on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway can go to the countryside to concentrate the materials that people transport to the highway by yaks, horses, camels, and carts, and transport them to the railway line. In this way, people can smoothly transport their products and buy what they need. Currently, only 2,000 metric tons of goods are transported from Xi'an to Lanzhou each month. Transportation difficulties and high freight rates make industrial products in Lanzhou generally one-third more expensive than in the place of origin. The Jiangxi porcelain that we commonly see has become a rare and precious item in some families in the Northwest. Because there is no railway, wheat in eastern Gansu is half the price of Lanzhou, while the people of Lanzhou sometimes have difficulty obtaining food during the lean season. With the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the people of Lanzhou can not only get grain in time, but also sell their famous drunken melons and green-fleshed melons.

The people need this railway so urgently!

In the past, the reactionary ruling class surveyed this railway in 1914, and the Kuomintang bandits even started construction in 1946. However, until the liberation of the entire Gansu, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway was still just a road on paper. But in the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, in just two years and four months (eight months ahead of the original plan), what had not been done for decades was accomplished.

When our train meanders westward along the Wei River, it sometimes passes by the side of a cliff, which is a cutting opened up from the mountains. In some places, the mountains on both sides are so treacherous that they seem to wrap the carriages in the middle, but now they have been blocked by huge cement-built open tunnels. Sometimes the train speeds over towering deep-gully bridges, and the depth of dozens of meters will startle you. Sometimes the train climbs steep mountain slopes, and it takes two locomotives to pull and push to climb up, which is where people have transformed the mountainside into a roadbed; sometimes the train seems to be rushing towards a stone wall, but in an instant it is suddenly swallowed by a tunnel appearing on the stone wall. Sometimes, the train has to travel in the cave for several minutes. These projects have all made the workers experience arduous roads. When some tunnels were under construction, the workers were often suffocated by the thin air inside the cave. Some fainted, drank a little Ten Drops Water and continued to work. In some tunnels, the soil was too hard, and workers had to use twelve-pound hammers to hit steel chisels. Huge tunnels were made by hitting one chisel at a time. In some tunnels, variegated soil layers were seeping with spring water, and people crawled and knelt in the mud to work. No tools could be used, so they had to dig mud with their hands. To open a tunnel, sometimes tens of millions of tons of earth and stone had to be removed, but all the tunnels were finally conquered one by one by the workers heroically. In one tunnel, when the project was in full swing, the top soil suddenly collapsed, sealing nine workers working in the tunnel. At first, they were a little dazed by the shock; later, they found that there was still a little air blowing in from the tunnel entrance, so the nine people started to dig. They had no food or drink, no rest, but they finally conquered the collapsed earth and stone, rushed out, and soon began new labor, building this tunnel.

A person never considers his own hardship in the most difficult times; and can still maintain his usual composure in the most dangerous times. The workers of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway all belong to such people. Wang Xiuwen, a worker in the top road team I met on the Tianshui-Lanzhou line, is one of those thousands of people. Once, he smashed four fingers in an accident at work, his fingernails fell off, and blood oozed out, but he remained calm and continued to work. People wanted him to rest, but he refused. He said: "One of my hands is broken, but the other hand can still spread spikes!" Finally, the captain had to order him to rest. But his heart really couldn't rest, he asked the captain to allow him to watch the door and stand guard at home for others. He said: "My hand can't move, but my feet can still walk. Let me stay at home and watch the door, and free up one more person to go to the site to work." It was difficult to refuse his enthusiasm, so the captain had to agree to his request. Near the resident of the top road team, Wang Xiuwen could often be seen patrolling back and forth. But this young man was still not satisfied. He thought: What if he encountered bad guys, how could he deal with them without a gun? He felt that he should have a gun like others to really play the role of standing guard. Later, his request was approved, and he jumped with joy like a child. Like many workers on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, Wang Xiuwen suffered from the cruel exploitation of contractors in the past. At that time, he didn't have shoes to wear when he worked. Once, when he was carrying sleepers, the soles of his feet were cut by glass. The contractor still asked him to pull ropes and drive piles. He felt pain in his heart and headache, and couldn't stand, but he had to lean on a small stick to work hard. The Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau abolished the contractor system in May 1951, removing the big stone that was pressing on the workers, and Wang Xiuwen and his worker brothers around him then got a life of sufficient food and clothing, and were no longer oppressed and exploited. Therefore, they deeply felt the flesh-and-blood connection between the new China and them, making them so willing to work selflessly and selflessly.

Engineering and technical personnel also contributed their strength in the construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou line. In the beginning, many technical personnel had no confidence in completing such a difficult railway in such a short period of time. However, when they understood relying on the masses of workers and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, they fully exerted their talents. Some engineers climbed mountains and ridges to complete an engineering task, and did not leave the site day or night. Some engineers dug a hole on the hillside, simply arranged their families, and often put on their wet cotton clothes and went out to work before they were dry. An internal combustion engine engineer, Zhu Yongkang, and the workers repaired an oxygen car with incomplete parts. The workers sacrificed their rest time late at night to listen to him explain the principle and use of the oxygen car, which moved him greatly. When the oxygen car was repaired for the first time and produced oxygen, the ammonia gas that suddenly sprayed out damaged his eyes. He left the hospital before his eye injury was completely healed and worked continuously for a day and a night, finally reviving the oxygen car worth 1.5 billion yuan. The mutual help between workers and engineering and technical personnel made technology shine with more beautiful brilliance. Shi Yanchao, who participated in the 41st tunnel project, often held meetings with workers to talk about technology, telling them how to make cement to ensure quality standards; how to calculate earthwork, so that everyone knows how much work they have done in a day. He also helped the workers draw rough sketches of each work section, so that people could know where they were working and how far the project they were undertaking had progressed. The 41st tunnel is several li long, and the work of hitting the center line (that is, determining the center position of the tunnel) is even more important. To open a tunnel, both ends are carried out at the same time. If the work of hitting the center line is not done well, if the holes at both ends do not match together, the project will fail. He and carpenter Shi Jingrong and others changed the method of using flagpoles and plumb bobs, and created a tool for finding the center of the tunnel, making the work of hitting the center line more accurate. When the two ends of this tunnel were opened, looking from this end to the other, it was straight, with a difference of no more than two centimeters. In this way, he became a very outstanding person in the construction of this huge tunnel project.

The advanced experience of the Soviet Union provided good help for the construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, and it had a great education and inspiration for our engineering and technical personnel. Soviet experts suggested that road construction must organize self-run engineering teams, which greatly improved engineering efficiency. The cement finished product factory directly helped by Soviet experts provided a large number of low-cost, high-quality cement beams along the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. The Soviet method of layered filling and tamping in road construction ensured the roadbed was firm. Due to the adoption of Soviet waterproof and drainage projects, the lifespan of tunnels and culverts has also been extended. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union broadened the horizons of engineering and technical personnel, and also improved their enthusiasm for learning and progress.

The completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway has extended the railway of more than 1,000 kilometers from the coast of Lianyungang in our country to the Northwest Plateau by another 347 kilometers to the west. This makes the fraternal ethnic groups of the distant provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang and the people of the whole country, and the heart of our country - Beijing, geographically closer. This will inevitably have a significant impact on the development of the economic and cultural life of the people in the Northwest. The completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is just the beginning of large-scale construction of railways in the Northwest. Our railway will extend to the distant border. This railway will bring infinite happiness and prosperity to the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest border. Countless large chimneys will stand tall on the Northwest Plateau, which has always been called barren and backward; the vast Gobi Desert will become a fertile oasis with abundant water and grass; Mongolian herdsmen in the vast Qaidam Basin will use machines to shear wool and squeeze milk; and Uygur girls by the Tarim River will wear silk from Hangzhou. And people living in Guangzhou or Shanghai can eat fresh, sweet and dense Hami melons and grapes from Turpan in Xinjiang early on. (Attached picture)

    天兰铁路—西北各族人民的幸福之路
    本报记者    陆灏
    要在拔海三千公尺以上峰峦连绵的、陇山山脉中修建天兰铁路，就必须在万山丛中开凿总长二十余华里的山峒。这些山峒，一座连一座，有的竟长数华里。这些山峒，有的全是坚硬的石头；有的石头是酥的，这边刚清除完，那边又坍下来，给工程造成很大的困难；有的峒里是水和稀泥，开山峒还要和泉水作斗争。
    困难不仅仅如此。
    在西北高原修建铁路，还必须和纵横的河流和深险的沟壑作严重的斗争。天兰铁路总共有一千多座桥涵，其中六十多座桥涵的长度就有八华里。这些桥梁，有的下面深达几十米，架在陡削的峡谷之间；有的在混浊的渭河上，像穿梭似地来来去去，往返在渭河的滩地。
    开隧道，建桥梁，需要千万吨洋灰、钢梁；路基上需要的每一根铁轨、每一根枕木，都须穿越千山万水，从遥远的东北、华北和南方运到这空人也难行走的地方来。
    天兰路上从陇西到定西的百余里内是苦水区、无水区，人烟稀少，草木也不能好好生长。人喝的水和打洋灰用的水，都要从很远的地方送来。几万人在这里做工，本地连蔬菜和木柴都无法供应，粮食要到西安、宝鸡去购买。
    困难很多，而且都是很严重的困难。但是，人民要求在这里修建一条铁路的愿望是十分迫切的。
    我们祖国的西北蕴藏着海一样的石油，石油对于工业，正像人身上的血和人的关系一样。但由于交通阻塞，开采石油的机器无法运去，因而大规模的开采工程不能进行。就是已经开采出来的石油，也不能很快地运至全国。用汽车运输，则要消耗运出来的石油的四分之一。如果从天水到兰州修成一条铁路，就可以从兰州开始将石油运送至全国各地，而开采石油的各种机器，也可以直接运到兰州再转工地。甘肃有的煤矿现在因为缺乏机器，煤的成本比机器开采的要高一倍。兰州正在建立的毛织厂、制革厂，都等待火车帮助他们把机器迅速运来。天兰铁路修成了，对于加速我们国家的工业化，将有难以估价的贡献。
    兰州是甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等省少数民族和内地贸易的枢纽。但由于山高路远，有的地方只能以牦牛为唯一的交通工具，因而那里的少数民族同胞不能更多地卖出自己剩余的牛羊和皮毛。拉卜楞是甘肃最大的皮毛集散地，但因交通不便，安多藏区的羊毛、毛皮无法全部运出。从西宁到兰州只有二百三十四公里，但是现在国营贸易公司收购的羊毛，每天要积压六、七十万斤。洮河流域的当归，宁夏的枸杞，也都迫切需要寻找出路。如果从天水到兰州有了铁路，奔跑在西兰公路上的大批汽车就可以下乡，把人们用牦牛马骆驼和大车运到公路上的物资集中运到铁路沿线。这样，人们就可以顺利地运出自己的生产品；并买到自己需要的东西。现在从西安运到兰州的物资，每月不过两千公吨。运输的困难和运价昂贵，使兰州的工业品一般要比产地贵三分之一。我们普通常见的江西瓷器，在西北某些地区的家庭中成了稀见的贵重用品。因为没有铁路，陇东的小麦比兰州贱一半，而兰州人民在青黄不接的季节却有时很难得到食粮。天兰铁路通了，兰州人民不但可以及时得到粮食，还可以卖出著名的醉瓜和绿瓤瓜。
    人民是这样迫切地需要这条铁路！
    过去，反动统治阶级曾经在一九一四年勘测过这条铁路，一九四六年国民党匪帮还动过工。但是，一直到甘肃全境解放，天兰铁路仍然只是纸上的路。可是在毛主席领导下的新中国，仅仅用了两年零四个月的时间（比原计划提前八个月），就把过去几十年没有做到的事情做成了。
    当我们的火车沿着渭河蜿蜒西行的时候，火车时而在悬崖绝壁的旁边经过，那是从丛山峻岭中开辟出来的路堑。有的地方两面的山头险恶的像要把车厢裹在当中，但现在已被巨大的水泥筑成的明峒挡住了。火车时而在高耸的深沟桥上驰过，几十丈的深谷会使你惊心。有时火车爬上陡折的山坡，要有两个车头前拉后推才能爬上去，那是人们把大山的山腰改成了路基；有时火车好像是在冲向一座石壁，一瞬间却被石壁上出现的隧道突然吞没了。有时候，火车要在洞里行走好几分钟。这些工程，都曾经使工人们经历过艰苦的道路，有的隧道在工程进行时，工人们常常为洞内稀薄的空气窒塞得难以呼吸。有的晕倒了，喝一点十滴水继续工作。有的隧道内土质太硬，工人要用十二磅重的铁锤打钢钎，巨大的隧道是被一钎一钎地打成的。在有的隧道里，杂色土层渗着泉水，人们爬着、跪着在泥浆里工作，什么工具也使用不上，只好用两只手挖泥。打通一个隧道，有时要吐出千万吨的土石方，但所有的隧道终于都被工人们英勇地一个一个征服了。有一个隧道，工程正在紧张进行的时候，顶上的土层突然倒坍下来，封住了在峒内工作的九个工人。开始时他们被震得有些昏迷了；后来发现峒口还有一点空气吹进来，于是九个人开始动手挖土。他们没有吃喝，没有休息，但他们终于征服了坍下来的土方，冲了出来，很快又开始了新的劳动，打成了这座隧道。
    一个人在最艰苦的时候从不考虑自己的艰苦；在最危急的时候犹能够保持平日的镇静。天兰铁路的工人们，都是属于这样的人。我在天兰路上认识的顶道队工人王秀文，就是这样的千万个人当中的一个。有一次，他在工作中被砸坏了四个手指，指甲脱落，鲜血涔涔，但他不动声色，继续工作。人们要他休息，他不肯休息。他说：“我一只手砸坏了，另一只手还可以撒道钉呀！”最后只好由队长命令他休息。但他的心实在不能休息，他要求队长允许他替别人留在家里看门站岗。他说：“我的手不能动，我的脚还可以走。让我留在家里看门，多腾出一个人到现场去工作。”热情难却，队长只好答应了他的请求。在顶道队的驻地附近，以后就常常看见王秀文来回巡逻。但这位年青人还是不满足。他想：万一碰上了坏人，没有枪怎么能对付？他觉得应该像别人一样有一枝枪，才能真正起站岗的作用。后来，他的要求被批准了，他高兴得就像小孩似的欢跃。王秀文像天兰路上的很多工人一样，过去饱受过包商的残酷剥削。那时候他做工没有鞋子穿，一次扛枕木，脚底被玻璃扎烂了，包商还要他去拉绳打桩。他痛得心烧，头痛，站也站不住，但只好拄根小棍去卖力。西北铁路干线工程局在一九五一年五月废除了包商制，搬掉了压在工人身上的大石头，王秀文和他周围的工人兄弟们于是才得到了衣食丰足的生活，再也不受压迫和剥削了。因此他们深深地感受到新中国与他们之间的血肉联系，使他们那样愿意奋不顾身地忘我地劳动。
    工程技术人员在修建天兰路的过程中也贡献了自己的力量。在开始，有不少技术人员对于用这样短的时间修好这样难修的铁路没有信心。但是，当他们懂得了依靠工人群众、学习苏联先进经验之后，他们就充分地发挥了自己的才能。有的工程师为了完成一个工程任务爬山越岭，黑夜白天都不离开现场。有的工程师在山坡上挖一个洞，简单地安置了自己的家庭，常常不等湿透了的棉衣烤干，又穿在身上出去工作。有一个内燃机工程师朱永康，他和工人们在一起修复一架零件不全的氧气车。工人们深更半夜牺牲休息时间听他讲解氧气车的原理和使用方法，使他很受感动。在氧气车第一次修好制氧的时候，突然喷出来的阿莫尼亚气喷坏了他的眼睛，他在眼伤尚未完全痊愈的时候就出了医院，连续一天一夜地工作，终于使价值十五亿元的氧气车复活了。工人和工程技术人员之间的互相帮助，使技术闪耀了更美丽的光辉。参加第四十一号隧道工程的时雁超，经常给工人开会讲技术，告诉他们怎么打洋灰就可以保证质量标准；怎么算土方，使每个人知道自己一天干了多少活。他还帮助工人们把各个工作断面画成草图，使人们看了这些图，就能够知道自己是在什么地方工作；自己担负的工程已经进行到什么程度。四十一号隧道有数华里长，打中线（即指测定隧道的中心位置）的工作就更重要。开一个隧道，两头同时进行，要是打中线的工作作不好，结果如果两头的洞对不在一起，工程就要失败。他和木工史景荣等改变了用标杆吊线锤的办法，创造了一架找隧道中心的工具，使打中线的工作更加准确起来。当这座隧道两头打通的时候，从这头看那头，笔笔直直，相差不过两公分。就是这样，他在这个巨大隧道工程的建设中成了一个很出色的人。
    苏联的先进经验，对于天兰铁路的建设提供了良好的帮助，它对于我们的工程技术人员有很大的教育和启示。苏联专家建议修路必须组织自办工程队，这个办法大大提高了工程效率。苏联专家直接帮助建立的洋灰成品厂，使天兰铁路沿线得到了大批成本低、质量好的洋灰梁。苏联修路的分层填土打夯的办法，保障了路基坚固。由于采用苏联的防水、排水工程，隧道、涵洞的寿命也延长了。苏联的先进经验扩大了工程技术人员的眼界，也提高了他们学习和前进的热情。
    天兰铁路的修成，使我们祖国从连云港的海边开始直达西北高原的那条一千余公里的铁路，又向西延伸了三百四十七公里。这就使得遥远的甘肃、青海、宁夏、新疆等省的各兄弟民族和全国人民，和我们祖国的心脏——北京，在地理上是更加靠近了。这对于发展西北人民的经济生活和文化生活将必然产生重大的影响。天兰铁路的修建完成，不过是大规模建设西北铁路的开始，我们的铁路将一直伸展到遥远的边疆，这铁路将给西北边疆各族人民带来无穷的幸福和繁荣。那一向被人称为荒凉落后的西北高原将矗立起无数的大烟囱；那一望无垠的大戈壁将变成水草丰美的绿洲；那辽阔的柴达木盆地上蒙族的牧民们剪羊毛和挤牛乳都将使用机器；那塔里木河边上的维族姑娘们将穿起来自杭州的绸罗。而住在广州或者上海的人们，就可以早早吃到新疆鲜美密甜的哈密瓜和吐鲁番的葡萄了。（附图片）
