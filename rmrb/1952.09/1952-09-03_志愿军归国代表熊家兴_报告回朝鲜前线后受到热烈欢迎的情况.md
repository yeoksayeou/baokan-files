    Reports on the Warm Welcome Received After Returning to the Korean Front

    Respected Chairman Mao: I am a representative of the Volunteer Army Homecoming Delegation. Now I am reporting to you on the situation after returning to the Korean front.
    We left our beloved motherland on June 25th. After returning to the Korean front, we were warmly welcomed by the leaders and comrades, which truly demonstrates the comrades' infinite love for you and the people of the motherland. When I met Comrade Cai Shufen, the political instructor of a certain machine gun and artillery company, he held my hand tightly and said, "You returned to the motherland, met the great leader Chairman Mao and all the leaders, and shook hands with thousands upon thousands of the elders of the motherland. When I shake your hand, it is like shaking hands with the people of the motherland. I feel infinitely honored."
    We reported to the leaders and gave many reports to the comrades on the Korean front, conveying your and the motherland people's care and love for us, and the great achievements in all aspects of the motherland's construction. I told the comrades about the countless touching things I saw in the motherland without reservation. Although the time was very long, the comrades did not feel tired, and each time they asked to hear more. Some comrades had combat missions and did not hear our report in their own units. When we went to other units to give reports, they traveled dozens of miles to attend, regardless of fatigue, because the comrades were eager to know every little thing about the motherland.
    After listening to the reports, the comrades all held discussions. Everyone was encouraged by the leap forward progress of the motherland in the past two years, and everyone was determined to repay your and the motherland people's care and love with practical actions. Like Comrade Zhang Menggao of the Second Company of a certain unit said: "Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland are so concerned about us! I deeply feel that my contribution to the motherland is too little. In the future, I must fight more bravely and strive to earn merit and join the Party."

    报告回朝鲜前线后受到热烈欢迎的情况
    敬爱的毛主席：我是志愿军归国代表团的代表。现在我把返回朝鲜前线后的情况向您报告。
    我们在六月二十五日离开了可爱的祖国。回到朝鲜前线后，我们受到首长和同志们的热烈欢迎，这正表现了同志们对您和祖国人民的无限热爱。当我见到某部机炮连指导员蔡树芬同志时，他紧紧地握住我的手说：“你回到祖国，见了伟大的领袖毛主席和各位首长，和千千万万的祖国父老握了手。我和你握手，也就像和祖国人民握了手一样。我感到无限的光荣。”
    我们在朝鲜前线向首长作了汇报，向同志们作了很多次的报告，传达您和祖国人民对我们的关怀和热爱，祖国建设事业各方面的伟大成就。我把在祖国看到的无数使人感动的事情，毫不遗留地讲给同志们听，虽然时间很长，但同志们并不觉得累，每次总要求再多讲一些。有的同志因为有战斗任务，在本单位没有听到我们的报告。当我们到其他单位作报告时，他们却不顾疲劳地跋涉几十里路赶来参加。因为同志们渴望着知道祖国每一件细小的事情。
    同志们听完报告后，都进行了讨论。大家为祖国二年来的飞跃进步而鼓舞，大家决心以实际行动来答谢你和祖国人民的关怀和热爱。像某部二连张梦高同志说：“毛主席和祖国人民对我们是多么关怀啊！我深深感到自己对祖国的贡献太少了。今后我一定要更英勇地战斗，争取立功入党。”
