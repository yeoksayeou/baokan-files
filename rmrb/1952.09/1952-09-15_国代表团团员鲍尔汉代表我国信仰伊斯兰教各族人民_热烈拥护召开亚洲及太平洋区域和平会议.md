Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, September 13th: Burhan, a member of the Chinese delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Islamic Association, spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters on the eve of the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, representing the 10 million people of all ethnic groups in China who believe in Islam, expressing their warm support and sincere hope for the conference.

Burhan said: "The 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific region are now facing a serious threat from the shadow of war. The US government, disregarding the opposition of people all over the world, blatantly uses heinous germ weapons in Korea, indiscriminately bombards peaceful Korean residents, delays and obstructs the Korean armistice negotiations, occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, unilaterally and illegally concludes the 'Japanese Peace Treaty,' militarily interferes in the national independence and liberation movements in Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, organizes the aggressive 'Middle East Command,' and forcibly establishes military bases everywhere. At this time of tense international situation, the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is very timely. It fully conforms to the will of peace-loving people all over the world, and it also fully conforms to the wishes of Muslims (Note: those who believe in Islam) all over the world."

Burhan said: "Muslims all over the world have always been ardent lovers of peace. The term 'Islam' itself contains the meaning of purity, safety, and peace. The Koran has indicated to us: Muslims do not want to be violated by others, nor will they violate others. The Koran has also indicated to us: Muslims are not afraid of intimidation and must stand on the battlefield of peace. The devil who destroys our path is our open enemy, and we must use our own strength to strive for final victory. We firmly believe that the Muslim representatives attending the conference, in the face of the fact that peace and security in the Asian and Pacific region are being undermined, will follow the instructions of the Koran, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, ethnic differences, and occupational categories, and take concerted action with representatives of peace-loving people from all countries in the Asian and Pacific region to end all existing and latent conflicts and crises in Asia, and to crush all the conspiracies and tricks of the US war-mongers to launch new aggressive wars."

Burhan also said: "The war forces of the United States are a greedy and insatiable pack of wolves. In order to hunt for war profits, they adopt an aggressive policy toward any country and nation, regardless of any religious belief. Taking our country as an example, in the old China, under the instigation of the American aggressors, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang adopted a policy of discrimination, division, and massacre against the various ethnic groups in our country who believe in Islam, making the Muslims in our country increasingly fall into the abyss of poverty, backwardness, darkness, and suffering for decades. After the people of all ethnic groups in our country, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, eliminated the reactionary armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and eradicated the aggressive forces and influence of the United States in our country, in just three years, our people's government vigorously carried out various tasks such as culture, education, trade, and health, and restored and developed agricultural, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and industrial construction, so that the people of all ethnic groups in our country who believe in Islam fully enjoy the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief, and enjoy a peaceful and happy life. However, the American imperialists have not given up their sabotage of the happy and peaceful life of our country's Muslims. As early as before the liberation of Xinjiang in 1949, US imperialist spies Mark Nan (the former Deputy Consul of the US Consulate in Dihua) personally bought, arranged, and instigated the armed rebellion of Islamic traitors Usman and other bandits, dreaming of dragging our country's Muslims into the hellfire. Now, Usman has ended his shameful life under the righteous sword of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. When the people of all ethnic groups in our country who believe in Islam live happily in the friendly and cooperative big family of the People's Republic of China, we cannot fail to notice the suffering that our country's Muslims have suffered in history, which is currently being replicated or re-enacted in many Islamic countries. Our country's Muslims express deep sympathy and condolences to these Muslims, and hope that Muslims all over the world and people all over the world will unite closely to defend lasting peace throughout the world and strive for our own survival and freedom."

Burhan continued: "In order to save peace in the Asian and Pacific region, our country's Muslims sincerely hope that the conference will appeal to the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific region, calling on all kind, upright, peace-loving, and just people to unite and find various appropriate and proper ways to stop the conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism, prohibit the evil propaganda that advocates war and racial hatred and religious discrimination, prohibit the use of atomic, germ, and chemical weapons and the bombing and massacre of peaceful residents and Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue and all issues related to peace in the Asian and Pacific region such as Vietnam and Malaya on a fair and reasonable basis, in order to guarantee the true independence, freedom, and peace of the people in the Asian and Pacific region, and on this basis, develop equal and mutually beneficial legitimate international economic relations and cultural exchanges, improve the lives of people all over the world, and increase the welfare of women and children all over the world."

Burhan finally said: "On behalf of the ten million people of the Hui, Uygur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik, Tatar, Kirgiz, Dongxiang, Salar, and Bonan ethnic groups in China who believe in Islam, I wish the conference a successful opening and a successful conclusion. The people of all ethnic groups in our country who believe in Islam will combine the spirit of patriotism and internationalism and unite closely with peace-loving people all over the world to strive for peace in the Asian and Pacific region and the world."

    我国代表团团员鲍尔汉代表我国信仰伊斯兰教各族人民
    热烈拥护召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社迪化十三日电】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的中国代表团团员、中国伊斯兰教协会筹备委员会主任鲍尔汉，在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕前夕，代表我国一千万信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，向新华社记者发表谈话，表达他们对于这一会议的热烈拥护和赤诚的希望。
    鲍尔汉说：“现在亚洲及太平洋区域的十六亿人民，正面临着战争魔影的严重威胁。美国政府悍然不顾全世界人民的反对，明目张胆地在朝鲜境内使用万恶的细菌武器，滥肆轰炸朝鲜和平居民，拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判；侵占我国领土台湾；并片面非法地缔结‘对日和约’；军事干涉越南、马来亚、菲律宾民族独立解放运动；组织侵略性的‘中东司令部’；到处强行建立军事基地。在这国际风云紧张之际，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，是非常切合时宜的。它完全符合于全世界爱好和平人民的意志，也完全符合于全世界穆斯林（注：信仰伊斯兰教者）的心愿。”
    鲍尔汉说：“全世界的穆斯林，从来都是酷爱和平的。‘伊斯兰’这个名词，就含有清真的、安全的、和平的意义。可兰经曾示意我们：穆斯林不愿受他人的侵犯，也决不去侵犯他人。可兰经又曾示意我们：穆斯林不畏恫吓，都要站在和平战场上。破坏我们道路的魔鬼，就是我们公开的敌人，我们要用自己的力量去争取最后胜利。我们深信参加会议的穆斯林代表们，在亚洲及太平洋区域的和平和安全正受到破坏的事实面前，会遵循可兰经的示意，不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族差别和职业种类，与亚洲及太平洋区域各国和平人民的代表，采取一致的行动，结束亚洲一切现存的、潜伏的冲突和危机，粉碎美国战争贩子发动新侵略战争的一切阴谋诡计。”
    鲍尔汉又说：“美国的战争势力，是贪婪无厌的狼群，为了猎取战争利润，它们不管对什么国家民族，不论对什么宗教信仰，完全一律地采取侵略政策。以我国为例，在旧中国里，蒋介石匪帮在美国侵略者的指使下，对我国信仰伊斯兰教的各个民族，采取了歧视、分裂和屠杀的政策，使得我国的穆斯林数十年来日益陷于贫困、落后、黑暗和痛苦的深渊；当我国各族人民在自己伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下，消灭了蒋介石匪帮的反动武装，肃清了美国在我国的侵略势力和影响之后，仅仅三年时间，我国人民政府就大力开展了文化、教育、贸易、卫生等各项工作，恢复和发展了农业、水利、畜牧和工业生产建设，使得我国信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，充分享受到民族平等和宗教信仰自由的权利，并享受着和平幸福的生活。但是，美国帝国主义者并没有放弃对于我国穆斯林幸福和平生活的破坏。还在一九四九年新疆解放前夕，美帝国主义间谍分子马克南（解放前美国驻迪化领事馆副领事），就亲自收买、布置和唆使伊斯兰教的叛徒乌斯满等匪帮武装叛乱，梦想将我国穆斯林拖到火狱中去。现在，乌斯满已经在我国各族人民正义之剑下，结束了他可耻的一生。当我国信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民幸福地生活在中华人民共和国友爱合作的大家庭里的时候，我们不能不注意到我国穆斯林在历史上曾经遭受过的痛苦，目前正在许多伊斯兰教国家里翻版或者重新上演，我国的穆斯林对于这些穆斯林，寄予深刻的同情和慰问，并盼望全世界的穆斯林和全世界人民紧紧团结一致，保卫全世界的持久和平，争取我们自己的生存与自由。”
    鲍尔汉接着说：“为了拯救亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，我国穆斯林赤诚地盼望会议向亚洲及太平洋区域的十六亿人民呼吁，号召一切善良的、正直的、爱好和平和正义的人民团结起来，寻找各种适当妥善的方法，来制止复活日本军国主义的阴谋，禁止鼓吹战争以及种族仇恨、宗教歧视的罪恶宣传，禁止使用原子、细菌、化学武器及对和平居民、朝中战俘的轰炸和屠杀，并在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题以及越南、马来亚等一切有关亚洲及太平洋区域和平的问题，以保障亚洲及太平洋区域人民的真正独立、自由与和平，并在这一基础上，发展平等互利的正当的国际经济关系与文化交流，改善全世界人民的生活，增进全世界妇孺的福利。”
    鲍尔汉最后说：“我代表中国信仰伊斯兰教的回、维吾尔、哈萨克、乌兹别克、塔吉克、塔塔尔、柯尔克兹、东乡、撒拉、保安等十个民族的一千万人民，预祝这一会议的胜利召开和圆满闭幕。我国信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，决本爱国主义与国际主义相结合的精神，和全世界爱好和平的人民紧密团结起来，为争取亚洲及太平洋区域以及世界和平而奋斗。”
