As plant pathology workers, we, along with expressing our sincere support for the International Scientific Commission's impartial report and admiring their meticulous and pragmatic scientific attitude, feel boundless anger at the crimes of US imperialism. The authoritative scientists of the International Scientific Commission, after more than two months of precise on-the-ground investigation and research, have once again revealed, with ironclad evidence, the facts of US imperialists conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China.

US imperialism dropped a large number of leaves carrying apple and pear ring rot pathogens, leaves carrying apple, pear, and cotton anthracnose pathogens, soybean pods carrying soybean purple stain pathogens, and corn kernels carrying corn smut pathogens in North Korea and Northeast China. These pieces of evidence have all been rigorously proven by scientific methods and have become an undeniable part of US imperialism's crimes in conducting biological warfare in North Korea and Northeast China. The purpose of US imperialists in using these biological warfare weapons is to spread the pathogens by using these bacteria-carrying plant bodies, attempting to have these pathogens harm our important crops, reducing crop yields or causing them to die. Their crimes have been prepared for a long time. As early as 1943, a biological warfare experiment station was established in the United States. In 1949, Rosebury, who was in charge of biological warfare research in the United States, mentioned the research of agricultural biological warfare in his book "Peace or Pestilence." He said: "We have no doubt that in this upside-down biology, we can find some plant pathogens suitable for bacteriological warfare targets. Camp Detrick has published three technical reports. All three reports are about fungal diseases, two about rice (rice blast and rice sesame leaf spot), and one about potatoes (late blight)...". On December 28, 1949, at the annual meeting of American national plant workers held at the Matternick Grand Hotel in New York, Professor Vogel, the representative of the Agricultural Biological Research Group of the American Institute of Biological Sciences, reported at the meeting: "American bioscience has served our armed forces in the same way as other sciences... and has made significant progress... The manual of biological data needed by the military, regarding plant diseases, has already begun to be collected." Following this, Dr. Thornberry also reported the content of the "Committee on the Utilization of Plant Pathology Workers and Equipment." He mainly explained that many plant pathology workers and entomology workers have already joined special organizations in the army. In 1951, "Life" magazine in the United States published a report on biological warfare weapons. In addition to human and animal pathogens, it also listed items such as wheat rust, corn smut, potato late blight, and bacterial blight of beans. Aptheker, deputy editor of the American magazine "Masses & Mainstream," said in a letter to "The New York Times": "In July and August of 1945, a ship full of American bacterial weapons used to destroy Japanese rice was heading to Mariana..." From this, it can be seen that the US imperialism's deliberate refusal to approve the Geneva Protocol was for the convenience of using germ warfare. Past attempts cannot be concealed, and current crimes have been revealed and confirmed by the International Scientific Committee. Is there anything to deny?

The evil intentions of US imperialism have completely gone bankrupt. In the New China under the leadership of Chairman Mao and in Korea under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the people have become masters of their own affairs, have a high degree of vigilance, have shattered the evil conspiracy of US imperialism to conduct germ warfare, and have eliminated the airborne epidemic materials. In the face of the great power of the people, any evil attempt of US imperialism is bound to fail completely.

    美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行伤害农作物的生物战的罪证
    中国植物病理学会理事长  戴芳澜
    中华全国科学技术普及协会常务理事  沈其益
    中国植物病理学会常务理事  裘维蕃
    国际科学委员会的权威科学家们，经过二个多月精密的实地调查研究，又一次铁证如山地揭露了美帝国主义者在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的事实。作为植物病理工作者的我们，除了竭诚拥护国际科学委员会这一公正的报告，钦佩他们细致的实事求是的科学态度外，对于美帝国主义的罪行，感到无比的愤怒。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜北部和我国东北投下了大量带有伤害苹果和梨的轮纹病菌的树叶，带有伤害苹果、梨及棉花的炭疽病菌的树叶，带有伤害大豆的紫斑病菌的豆荚和带有黑粉病菌的玉米粒等。这些罪证都是经过严格的科学方法加以证明，成为美帝国主义在朝鲜北部和我国东北进行生物战无可抵赖的罪行的一部分。美帝国主义者使用这些生物战武器的目的是利用这些带菌的植物体将病菌传播开来，企图让这些病菌侵害我们重要的农作物，使农作物减少产量或死亡。他们这种罪行是经过长期准备的。一九四三年，便在美国建立了生物战实验站。一九四九年美国主持生物战研究的罗斯培里所著“和平或瘟疫” 一书中曾经提到农业生物战的研究。他说：“我们无需怀疑，在这种巅倒生物学中，能找出一些适合于细菌战目标的植物病原体。狄特里克兵营曾发表了三篇技术性的报告。这三篇说的全是真菌病害，二种是关于水稻的（稻热病及稻胡麻斑病），一种是侵害马铃薯的（晚疫病）……”。一九四九年十二月二十八日美国全国植物工作者年会在纽约的马特尼克大旅社开会时，美国生物科学研究院农业生物研究组代表沃葛教授曾在会上报告：“美国生物科学已经与其他科学一样地为我们的武装力量服务……并且有显著的进展……军部所需要的生物资料手册，关于植物病害方面的已经着手进行收集”。接着桑伯利博士也报告了“植物病理工作人员及设备利用委员会”的内容。他主要说明许多植物病理工作者，昆虫工作者已经参加了军队中的特种组织。一九五一年美国“生活”杂志上出现了生物战武器的报道。除了人畜病菌以外，还列出了小麦的锈病、玉米的黑粉病、马铃薯的晚疫病和豆类的细菌性疫病等项目。美国“群众与主流”杂志副主编阿普脱克在致“纽约时报”的信中说：“在一九四五年的七月和八月，一艘满载美国细菌武器用以毁灭日本水稻的轮船在开往马里亚纳……”，从此可见美帝国主义的蓄意不批准日内瓦议定书，原是为了使用细菌战的方便。过去的企图既无法隐瞒，目前的罪行又已被揭露无遗，并经国际科学委员会证实。难道还有什么可以抵赖的吗？
    美帝国主义的罪恶企图是完全破产了。在毛主席领导下的新中国，在金日成将军领导下的朝鲜，人民已经当了家，有着高度的警惕性，粉碎了美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪恶阴谋，消灭了空投的疫物。在伟大人民力量的面前，美帝国主义的任何罪恶企图都必然彻底失败。
