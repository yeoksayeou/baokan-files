	I visited Tsinghua University on the eve of National Day. On the tree-lined paths of Tsinghua Garden, busy people were passing by. Inside and outside the garden, construction was underway everywhere. As soon as I entered Tsinghua Garden, I could hear the songs of teachers, students, and workers participating in the construction, and the propaganda broadcasts from the construction site. The central slogan of the broadcasts was: Complete the plan, welcome National Day. Some of these construction projects have already been completed and are being decorated; others are working overtime at night, rushing to welcome the new students who will soon be arriving at the university. Near the Meteorological Observatory and on the slopes east of the New Forest Area, red buildings are waiting for their new owners.

	The scale of Tsinghua University's construction this year is enormous, with a total area of 43,000 square meters, equivalent to 46% of the total construction area of Tsinghua University in the past forty years. The new buildings include: classroom buildings, mechanical practice factories, metalworking shops for the Department of Civil Engineering, automobile factories, gas factories, student dormitories, faculty residences, a large dining hall that can accommodate 2,500 people, as well as hospitals, nurseries, and more. These projects, from architectural design, construction, procurement and management of materials to finance and administration, were all done by teachers and students from the construction and civil engineering departments themselves. They relied on workers and demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of Tsinghua University.

	Over the past three years, the motherland's construction undertakings in various fields have been well-prepared for major development, and industrial departments are urgently "reaching out for people" to institutions of higher learning. "Order forms" from all sides are pouring in, requiring various professional cadres. In the past three years, Tsinghua University has had a total of 2,166 graduates, equivalent to more than 85% of the total number of graduates from Tsinghua University from 1911 to 1948, a period of 37 years. However, these graduates are far from meeting the needs of the country. This autumn, a large number of young people will flood into Tsinghua Garden. Next semester, Tsinghua University will have more than 5,800 students, more than double the number of students in the year with the most students before liberation. In the past three years, Tsinghua University students have made great progress in their thinking through various political movements. This spring, the number of Communist Youth League members in Tsinghua University reached 2,400. Among the graduates of the past three years, many model figures have emerged. Lin Zongtang, a graduate of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, was awarded the honorary title of "Model Communist Party Member" by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government. Liu Yixin, a graduate of the Department of Civil Engineering, has also become a "Huai River Harnessing Model" of the Ministry of Water Resources.

	Faced with the vigorous development of Tsinghua University, people cannot help but recall some of the chaotic situations of two or three years ago. At that time, among the teachers, the ideological system of the European and American bourgeoisie still occupied a dominant position, with many large and small fortresses. Most teachers adopted an "objective" and skeptical attitude towards the cause of people's liberation, the Communist Party, and the People's Government. One professor even believed that his future after liberation was "over," and he once "climbed a mountain to look into the distance," sighing, "Where is my grave!" and planned to move his entire family to the United States. Most teachers guarded their own knowledge and technology, and did not ask about politics. In the early days of liberation, teachers also carried out some political study, but the dogmatic study was basically unchanged. Since the early spring of 1950, Professor Ai Siqi "entered Tsinghua Garden three times," and gave several speeches at Tsinghua University. The reactionary ideas and bourgeois decadent ideas of the teachers began to be shaken. In the past three years, through the land reform movement, the anti-American and aid-Korea movement, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, teachers have made great progress in their thinking. The great ideological remolding movement and the "Three-Anti" movement fundamentally changed the ideological outlook of the teachers. As one teacher said: After the "Three-Anti" movement, he gained true ideological liberation. The entire Tsinghua University was truly liberated from the old tradition of bourgeois democratic individualism. Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Tsinghua University, said: After the "Three-Anti," the banner of the working class ideology was truly erected in Tsinghua University.

	The separation of teaching ideology and scientific research from colonial status is the main achievement of Tsinghua University's educational reform in the past three years. Higher industrial education in old China had a serious colonial industrial dependency. The direction of industrial education was to serve the imperialist promotion of industrial machinery products. Therefore, higher education in old China did not need to cultivate talents in mechanical design and manufacturing. It mainly trained talents in mechanical assembly, operation, and maintenance. Teachers who studied in capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain mostly only learned about mechanical assembly, while new technologies were monopolized by capitalists. Chinese students could not learn it, and it was useless to learn it and return to China. Therefore, most of these teachers unconsciously imparted the knowledge of mechanical assembly technology required by imperialism after returning to China. What we want to cultivate now are industrial cadres of an independent country. In the field of machinery, the main focus is on training talents in mechanical design and manufacturing. The original three groups of mechanical manufacturing, thermal power equipment, and automobiles in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University have been developed in accordance with the requirements of national construction. Tsinghua University's transformation from a comprehensive university to an industrial university has expanded the mechanical manufacturing group into four majors: "Mechanical Manufacturing Engineering," "Metal Cutting Machine Tools and Their Tools," "Casting Machines and Casting Engineering," and "Metal Pressure Processing and Processing Machines." The two majors of "Thermal Power Equipment" and "Automobile" have been established as the Department of Power Machinery. This means that Tsinghua University has put its main focus on mechanical design and manufacturing. This is also the fundamental difference between the current Tsinghua University and the past Tsinghua University in cultivating mechanical talents.

	In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, unemployment was a very serious social problem. In order to avoid unemployment after graduation, European and American bourgeois universities trained students to understand a little of everything in order to facilitate finding a job, and glorified it as "general education." The universities in old China copied this approach. Therefore, in the past, the teaching direction of Tsinghua University was to focus on general training. For example, the Department of Construction required students to not only learn architectural design well, but also to learn engineering structure well, and even to handle sewers, heating equipment, and electric lights, etc. As a result of this training, students could only be "jack of all trades, master of none." Tsinghua University has now basically changed this situation. Qian Weichang, Deputy Provost of Tsinghua University, said: Tsinghua University will cultivate a large number of qualified senior construction talents needed for the motherland's construction cause in the future. Tsinghua University's new departments and various majors are conducting highly refined professional training on a relatively broad foundation of scientific knowledge. Tsinghua University's various majors are set up according to the current and future development needs of various industrial sectors and with reference to Soviet experience. After having majors, the curriculum, teaching syllabus, and teaching materials are determined, and then the departments are formed according to the system of various sciences. The departments and majors are closely integrated with practice. In order to cultivate experts who can carry out independent creative work, have thinking skills, and have a high level of technology, Tsinghua University has adopted the Soviet industrial university teaching system and formulated a teaching plan, which clearly stipulates the task of production practice. The theoretical knowledge learned by students must be enriched and developed in actual production. Students complete three internships in four years. In the first production internship, students work in production as workers, taking on the main labor. The second production internship is after learning extensive knowledge about their own specialized science, working relatively independently in production as junior technicians. In the fourth year, during the graduation thesis internship, students work as shift engineers, combining all the theoretical knowledge learned in four years with production practice to conduct "graduation design" and propose improvement suggestions for the main problems in a certain project. In this way, each student's theoretical level and practical experience have reached the level of a fully qualified engineer, becoming a competent expert who can work independently in industry.

	In scientific research work, the most significant progress of Tsinghua University teachers is that they have overthrown the so-called "international standards" and "American standards" worshiping the United States in science, and replaced them with the standards of the Chinese people. Research oriented towards the people has replaced the research style of pursuing the so-called "international" academic status. In addition to some teachers conducting purely theoretical research for long-term considerations, some teachers have now begun to pay attention to researching the problems that need to be solved in current practical work. For example, Professor Duan Xuefu, head of the Department of Mathematics at Tsinghua University, used to mainly study abstract mathematics, but now he is beginning to pay attention to "mechanics" and "physics" needed for practical work. Professor Yu Ruihuang of the Department of Physics is now not only studying "X-ray crystallography," but also conducting research on X-ray tubes for medical use, and has achieved great success. After making an ideological review report in the "Three-Anti" movement, Professor Zhao Yibing of the Department of Biology at Tsinghua University gave up his research on hedgehogs, which he had been studying for three or four years. Now he is enthusiastically translating the teaching syllabus of "Human and Animal Physiology" in Soviet universities, and is very concerned about the textbook work of "Physiological Hygiene" in middle schools and scientific popularization work. He said: These things that he used to think were uninteresting and unworthy of doing are now considered very valuable work.

	When I visited Tsinghua Garden, the teachers of the College of Engineering of Tsinghua University were studying Russian intensely. Learning Russian is not a matter of learning a foreign language or a second foreign language in the general sense for professors, but a major event in which they are ideologically overthrowing the traditional academic views of the European and American bourgeoisie and further demanding to learn advanced Soviet science. More than 200 teachers from the College of Engineering of Tsinghua University and the College of Engineering of Peking University have recently organized themselves to concentrate on learning Russian. Their enthusiasm is extremely high. Jin Tao, a 65-year-old professor, crams more than 100 words a day. In about fifteen days, they crammed more than 1,000 words and initially mastered the basic rules of Russian grammar, and can read Russian scientific books in their field at a speed of ten pages per hour. One teacher said: This has opened the treasure house of science.

	Criticizing individualistic thinking is also an important achievement of Tsinghua University in the past three years. Tsinghua University has many professors who have achieved success in academics. They have always been indifferent to politics and regarded administrative work as "vulgar" and unworthy of doing. At Tsinghua University, there is the so-called slogan of "academics first, teaching second, and administration third." They now realize that this is due to individualism, which divides the people's cause into grades to consider the problem. Liu Xianzhou, an old professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, had been the president of Beiyang University twenty years ago. But since entering Tsinghua University in 1932, he has never thought of doing administrative work again. He once declared: "I will teach for another ten years and write five books in my life, and I will do nothing else." This time, Tsinghua University adjusted the departments and participated in administrative leadership. I asked him what his feelings were, and he simply replied to me: "Whatever the people need me to do, I will do." It would have been impossible to transfer university professors like this in the past Tsinghua University. After criticizing individualistic thinking, the teachers' political enthusiasm has generally increased. Now, every time there is a Party lecture at Tsinghua University, many teachers participate in listening. Often, white-haired old professors wear old-fashioned glasses and listen and take notes with young students. Learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has become a conscious requirement of teachers, and the prestige of the Communist Party has been unprecedentedly enhanced among teachers.

	The new Tsinghua of the new China is worthy of being called an industrial institution of higher learning serving the people's construction cause.

    人民的清华大学
    新华社记者　王伯恭
    我在国庆节前夕，访问了清华大学。清华园的林荫道上，过往着忙碌的人们。园里园外，到处都在进行建筑。一走进清华园，就可以听到参加建筑的教师们、同学们和工人们愉快劳动的歌声，和工地上宣传鼓动的广播，广播的中心口号是：完成计划，迎接国庆。这些建筑工程有的已经完工，正在装饰；有的还在连夜加班，赶着迎接即将来校的新同学。在气象台附近和新林院迤东的山坡上，一幢幢红色的房屋，正等待着它们的新主人。
    清华大学今年的建筑，规模巨大，总面积共达四万三千多平方公尺，相当于清华大学四十年来建筑总面积的百分之四十六。新的建筑有：教室大楼、机械实习工厂、土木系金工间、汽车工厂、煤气工厂、学生宿舍、教授住宅、能容二千五百人的大饭厅以及医院、托儿所等等。这些工程，从建筑设计、施工、采购和管理材料到财务、行政等工作，全部由营建、土木等系教师和学生自己动手做的。他们依靠工人，发挥了高度积极性和创造性。这在清华大学历史上是空前未有的现象。
    祖国三年来各方面建设事业都作好了大发展的准备工作，产业部门急迫地向高等学校“伸手要人”。各方面的“订货单”源源而来，需要各种各样的专业干部。三年来清华大学共有毕业生二千一百六十六名，相当于清华大学从一九一一年到一九四八年三十七年间毕业生总数百分之八十五多一点。但是，这些毕业生还远不能满足国家的需要，今年秋季，将有大批的青年涌进清华园来。下学期清华大学学生将达五千八百多人，比解放前在校学生最多的年份的学生数超过一倍以上。三年来清华大学的学生们，经过各种政治运动，思想都有很大进步。今年春季，清华大学里的青年团员发展到二千四百人。在三年来的毕业生中，涌现了不少模范人物。机械系毕业生林宗棠，曾获得东北人民政府工业部“模范党员”的光荣称号。土木系毕业生刘
    一辛也成为中央水利部的“治淮模范”。
    面对着清华大学这种蓬勃发展的情景，人们不禁回忆到两三年以前的一些混乱情况。当时在教师们当中，欧美资产阶级的思想体系还占着统治地位，其中有不少大大小小的堡垒。大部分教师对待人民解放事业，对待共产党和人民政府采取“客观的”、怀疑的态度，甚至有一位教授认为解放后他的前途
    “完了”，曾“登山远眺”，长叹“何处是我的坟墓！”并打算把全家搬到美国去。大部分教师守着自己的学问、技术，不问政治。解放初期，教师们也进行了一些政治学习，但基本上未改变教条主义的学习。从一九五零年春初，艾思奇教授“三进清华园”，在清华大学讲了几次话，教师中的反动思想和资产阶级腐朽思想才开始受到震动。三年来经过土地改革运动、抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动，教师们思想有很大进步。伟大的思想改造运动和“三反”运动，从根本上改变了教师的思想面貌。正如有一位教师所说：经过“三反”运动，才得到了思想上真正的解放。整个清华大学才真正从资产阶级民主个人主义的旧传统下彻底解放出来。清华大学教务长周培源说：“三反”以后，工人阶级思想的大旗，才真正在清华大学竖立起来了。
    教学思想和科学研究脱离殖民地状态，是清华大学三年来教育改革的主要成就。旧中国的高等工业教育存在着严重的殖民地工业的从属性，工业教育的方针，是为帝国主义推销工业机械成品而服务的。因此，旧中国的高等教育不需要培养机械设计和制造方面的人才，它主要训练机械装配、运转和修配的人才。在美英等资本主义国家留学的教师，大都只学到了机械装配方面的知识，新的技术却被资本家所垄断。中国留学生是学不到的，学了回国也没有用。因此，这些教师回国后，大部分都不自觉地传授帝国主义所要求的机械装配技术的知识。我们现在要培养的是独立国家的工业干部，机械方面，主要是训练机械设计和制造方面的人才。清华大学工学院机械系原有的机械制造、热力发电设备和汽车三个组，已遵照国家建设的要求加以发展。清华大学这次从综合性大学改变为工业大学，机械制造组扩充为“机械制造工程”、“金属切削机床及其工具”、“铸造机及铸造工程”、“金属压力加工及加工机”等四个专业。“热力发电设备”和“汽车”两个专业，另成立动力机械系。这就是说，清华大学已把主要力量放在机械的设计和制造方面。这也就是现在的清华大学和过去清华大学培养机械人才根本不同之处。
    在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，失业是一个很严重的社会问题。欧美资产阶级大学为了避免学生毕业后失业，把学生训练成样样都懂一点，以便于找职业，并美其名为“通才教育”。旧中国的大学就抄袭了这一套办法。所以在过去清华大学的教学方针，是注重一般的训练。例如营建系就是要求学生既要学好建筑设计，又要学好工程结构，甚至连上下水道、暖汽设备、电灯等等都要搞。这样训练的结果，学生当然只能是“三脚猫”的人才。清华大学现在已基本上改变了这种状况。清华大学副教务长钱伟长说：清华大学今后将大量培养祖国建设事业中所需要的合格的高级建设人才。清华大学新的系和各种专业，是在比较广的基础科学知识上，进行高度精细的专业训练。清华大学各种专业是根据各产业部门目前的和将来发展的需要并参照苏联经验设置的。有了专业以后，再定课程、教学大纲和教材，然后根据各种科学的体系组成系。系和专业是密切结合实际的。为了培养能进行独立创造工作的、有思想性和具有高度技术水平的专家，清华大学采取苏联工业大学教学制度，订立了教学计划，计划中明确规定了生产实习的任务。学生们所学的理论知识，必须在实际生产中得到充实和发展。学生们在四年中共作三次实习，第一次生产实习，学生们以工人身份在生产中工作，担任主要劳动；第二次生产实习，是在学了有关自己专门科学的广泛的知识后，以初级技术员的身份在生产中做比较独立的工作。到第四年毕业论文实习，学生们以值班工程师的身份工作，将四年所学的全部理论知识结合生产实际进行“毕业设计”，并对某项工程中的主要问题提出改进意见。这样，每个学生的理论水平和实际经验，已达到一个完全合格的工程师的水平，成为在工业中能独立工作的顶用的专家了。
    在科学研究工作中，清华大学教师们最显著的进步就是在科学上打倒了崇拜美国的所谓“国际标准”、“美国标准”，而代之以中国人民的标准。面向人民的研究已代替了追求所谓“国际”学术地位的研究作风。教师们除了一部分进行为长远打算的纯理论的研究外，有些教师现在已经开始注意研究目前实际工作所需要解决的问题。例如清华大学数学系系主任段学复教授过去主要研究抽象数学，现在开始注意实际工作所需要的“力学”和“物理学”了。物理系余瑞璜教授现在不仅研究“爱克斯光结晶学”，而且进行医疗用的爱克斯光放射管的研究工作，并获得很大成就。清华大学生物系赵以炳教授在“三反”运动中，作了思想检讨报告以后，放弃了他研究了三、四年的刺猬。现在他正满怀热情地翻译苏联高等学校“人体及动物生理学”教学大纲，并很关心中学的“生理卫生学”教科书工作和科学普及宣传工作。他说：这些过去认为没有兴趣和不屑于做的事情，现在觉得是很有价值的工作了。
    在我访问清华园的时候，清华大学工学院的教师们正紧张地学俄文。学俄文这件事在教授们中不是一般人所谓学一种外国语或第二种外国语的问题，而是他们从思想上打倒了欧美资产阶级传统学术观点，进一步要求学习苏联先进科学的大事情。清华大学工学院和北京大学工学院的教师二百多人最近组织起来集中学习俄文。他们的情绪高极了。六十五岁的老教授金涛，一天也突击一百多单字。他们在十五天左右的时间内，突击了一千多单字，并初步掌握了俄文文法基本规律，能以每小时看十页的速度阅读本行的俄文科学书籍。有一位教师说：这一下子打开了科学的宝库了。
    批判个人主义思想，也是三年来清华大学的重要成绩。清华大学有许多在学术上有成就的教授，他们一向不关心政治，把行政工作看成“庸俗”的和不屑于做的工作。在清华大学有所谓“学术第一、教学第二、行政第三”的口号。他们现在已认识到，这是个人主义作怪，才把人民事业分成等级来考虑问题。机械系老教授刘仙洲二十年前曾作过北洋大学校长。但从一九三二年进清华大学以后，就永远不再想干行政工作了。他曾宣称：“我这一辈子再教十年书，写五本书，就什么都不干了。”清华大学这次调整院系，他却参加了行政领导工作。我问他有什么感想，他简单地回答我：“人民需要我作什么，我就作什么。”在院系调整、人事更动中，有不少教师要应聘到其他地区的大学去工作。经济系教授余肇池说：“我相信组织是合情合理的。”政府这样调动大学教授，在过去的清华大学是根本办不到的。批判了个人主义思想以后，教师们的政治热情普遍高涨。现在清华大学每次上党课，很多教师都参加听讲。常常有白发苍苍的老教授戴着老光眼镜，和青年同学一道听讲、作笔记。学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，已成为教师们自觉的要求，共产党的威信在教师中空前提高了。
    新中国的新清华已经配得起称为为人民建设事业服务的工业高等学校了。
