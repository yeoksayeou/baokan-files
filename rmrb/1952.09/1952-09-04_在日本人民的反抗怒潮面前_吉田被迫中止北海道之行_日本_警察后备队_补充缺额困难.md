In the face of the Japanese people's rebellious anger

Yoshida was forced to cancel his trip to Hokkaido

Japan's "Police Reserve Force" faces difficulties in filling vacancies

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: According to Japanese democratic newspaper reports, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, due to the resistance of local people to the plan to requisition land in Hokkaido for use by the US military and the Police Reserve Force, had decided to personally go to Hokkaido on July 14th and 15th to supervise. Upon hearing the news, workers, farmers, and citizens in Hokkaido rose up to protest, raising the slogan "Don't let Yoshida set foot in Hokkaido."

Workers in many places, such as the Sorachi Coal Mine and the Kamui Mine of Hokkaido Coal Mining Company, resolved to strike to protest Yoshida's visit to Hokkaido. The Mitsubishi Coal Mining Company's Bibai mines resolved to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. Asahikawa City held a rally of more than 10,000 people to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, with representatives from Kitami, Tokachi, Kushiro, Sorachi, and other places participating. The workers and farmers present passed a resolution to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet and held a demonstration.

Railway stations along the line, such as Hakodate, Otaru, and Sapporo, also held rallies and demonstrations protesting Yoshida's visit to Hokkaido. As soon as the "Daisetsu" train that Yoshida was scheduled to board entered Otaru Station, angry workers surged onto the platform like a tide, wanting to "meet" Yoshida.

In the face of this wave of popular resistance, Yoshida had no choice but to cancel his trip to Hokkaido.

Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: Tokyo dispatch: The recruitment of new soldiers for the Japanese "Police Reserve Force," which was established to serve as cannon fodder for the American aggressors, is becoming increasingly difficult.

Recently, 27,000 members of the "Police Reserve Force" officially retired after their two-year term of service expired. In order to fill the vacancies they left behind, the "Police Reserve Force" launched a campaign to recruit 30,000 new soldiers. Despite the fact that there is widespread unemployment throughout Japan, very few people are willing to serve as cannon fodder. As of August 25th, only more than 14,000 people had applied, which is less than half of the quota. This situation has forced Ishikawa, Toyama, Niigata, and Hokkaido to extend the final recruitment deadline from the originally scheduled August 31st to September 9th.

Xinhua News Agency: TASS Tokyo, August 22nd: Japanese newspaper reports: The director of the Trade and Steel Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Oiwa Dai, told representatives of the aircraft industry that the government intends to take measures to develop the Japanese aircraft industry, especially by giving it priority in obtaining government loans.

According to the newspaper "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," Yawata Iron & Steel Works is studying plans to manufacture shells.

A government trade committee has approved a plan for five chemical companies to jointly establish a new company to manufacture explosives and munitions.

    在日本人民的反抗怒潮面前
    吉田被迫中止北海道之行
    日本“警察后备队”补充缺额困难
    【新华社三日讯】据日本民主报纸消息，日本首相吉田茂因在北海道征用供美军和警察后备队使用的土地的计划受到当地人民反抗，曾决定在七月十四日、十五日亲自出马，到北海道去督促。北海道的工人、农民和市民闻讯后纷纷起来抗议，提出了“不让吉田走进北海道一步”的口号。
    空知煤矿、北海道煤矿公司的神威矿等许多地方的工人都决议罢工抗议吉田来北海道，三菱煤矿公司的美呗各矿决议打倒吉田内阁。旭川市举行了一万多人的打倒吉田内阁大会，北见、十胜、钏路、空知等地都派了代表参加。与会的工人农民通过了打倒吉田内阁的决议，并举行了示威。
    铁路沿线的函馆、小樽、札幌等车站也举行了抗议吉田来北海道的大会和示威。吉田原定搭乘的“大雪号”火车一进入小樽车站，愤怒的工人就像潮水般地涌进月台，要找吉田“见见面”。
    吉田在人民这种反抗的怒潮面前，不得不中止了北海道之行。
    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：为美国侵略者充当炮灰而建立起来的日本“警察后备队”的招募新兵的工作，愈来愈困难了。
    最近“警察后备队”中有两万七千人在两年的服役期限届满后正式退伍。“警察后备队”为了填补他们所遗留下来的空额，发动了一个招募三万名新兵的运动。尽管日本的失业人口遍布全国，但是，愿意充当炮灰的却寥寥无几。截至八月二十五日为止，应征的人只有一万四千多名，还不到限额的一半。这种情况已使石川、富山、新潟和北海道等地，不得不将招募最后截止日期从原订的八月三十一日延长到九月九日。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社东京八月二十二日讯：日本报纸消息：日本通商产业省的通商钢铁局局长苇泽大义告诉飞机工业的代表说，政府打算采取措施以发展日本飞机工业，特别是给它获得政府贷款的优先权。
    据报纸“日本经济新闻”称，八幡制铁所正在研究制造炮弹的计划。
    一个政府的贸易委员会已批准五个化学公司联合设立一个新公司以制造爆炸物和军火的计划。
