New situations and problems to be solved in the mutual aid movement in Shanxi Province
Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture

In the first half of this year, the mutual aid organizations in Shanxi Province have greatly developed and improved in both quantity and quality. The peasant's mutual aid economy has become dominant in rural areas. The province now has 280,590 mutual aid groups of various types, with a total of 2,585,750 male and female laborers participating, accounting for 56.3% of the total rural labor force (including agricultural production cooperatives), an increase of 79% over last year. Permanent mutual aid groups accounted for 20% of the total mutual aid groups last year, increasing to 35.9% this year. Most permanent mutual aid groups have formulated annual or seasonal production plans, can adhere to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, begin to implement equal pay for equal work for male and female laborers participating in the mutual aid group, and closely integrate production activities with political study. Using forms such as "reading groups," "patriotic inspection days," and "patriotic production clubs," they regularly conduct patriotic and collectivist education for group members. Some of this type of mutual aid group have a longer history, more experience, stronger backbone, and have accumulated a portion of public property. They are no longer satisfied with the current form of mutual aid and are actively creating conditions to develop into agricultural production cooperatives. In some areas with weak work foundations, a considerable number of seasonal and temporary mutual aid groups have developed this year. These mutual aid groups lack leading backbones and mutual aid experience, have no production plans, and have not yet established sound systems. Their general characteristic is "mutual aid during busy farming seasons, individual work during slack seasons," or "agricultural mutual aid, individual sideline production." This type of mutual aid group needs to strengthen leadership and actively improve. It is particularly noteworthy that a small number of areas still have many formal groups that exist in name only. These formal groups not only do not play a role in production, but also have a very bad impact on the masses. This situation should be changed.

New characteristics of the mutual aid movement this year

I. The number of permanent mutual aid groups has increased, seasonal and temporary mutual aid groups have relatively decreased, and new situations of merging groups and joint groups have emerged. For example, last year, permanent mutual aid groups in Yuncheng Prefecture accounted for only 9.6% of the total mutual aid organizations, but this year it has increased to more than 50%. In Xiangyuan County, more than 1,000 temporary groups have been upgraded to permanent mutual aid groups. In areas with a better mutual aid foundation in Changzhi and Yuci Prefectures, many mutual aid groups have developed and expanded, the number of households in the group has increased, and some have been merged or linked together. The result of the expansion of mutual aid groups: (1) prepared the foundation for agricultural production cooperatives; (2) further expanded investment and developed production; (3) more reasonably used and allocated labor.

II. The public property of mutual aid groups has greatly increased, and the basic construction of land has been valued. The public property accumulated by 358 groups in Jiaocheng this year includes: 41 new-style walking plows, 10 waterwheels, 136 sprayers, 25 cotton gins, 7.5 million yuan in public accumulation funds, 3,607 jin of grain in charity granaries, and 489.8 mu of land, totaling more than 200 million yuan including the public property accumulated last year. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in Liuze in Huguan, Wangjiazhuang and Huojia Kiln in Licheng, Xigou and Chuandi in Pingshun, Dazhai in Yushe, and Baijiagou in Xingxian have carried out many basic construction works on the land using surplus labor. From spring to now, they have dug 7 water wells, 20 dry wells, 6 dry ponds, 3 living water ponds, 15 reservoirs, 92 cattle pits, and 49 small channels; they have also cooperated in afforestation of 350 mu and more than 10,000 trees, and collectively planted 8,806 trees. The increase in public property and the importance attached to basic land construction fully demonstrate that the collectivist ideology and the idea of fighting against nature in mutual aid groups have gradually increased.

III. The production planning of mutual aid groups has been strengthened. 10,500 mutual aid groups in Changzhi Prefecture have formulated production increase plans. 5,700 mutual aid groups in Pingshun participated in the patriotic production increase competition, of which 2,712 groups have formulated long-term plans. Among the 7,022 groups participating in the competition in Jincheng, 108 groups have formulated two-year plans, and 3,140 groups have formulated one-year plans. In order to realize the production plan, many groups have formulated "patriotic covenants" and adopted the method of "long-term plan, short-term arrangement" to initially overcome blindness in production.

IV. The "three major combinations" in mutual aid groups have been further developed. (1) At present, 30% to 40% of the mutual aid groups in the province have paid attention to improving technology. Most of these mutual aid groups have established "small farms" and "high-yield fields." There are 1,331 groups with high-yield fields in Licheng. There are 1,098 groups with technicians and 286 groups with small farms in Jiaocheng. The "technical training network" with farms as the core, mutual aid groups as the foundation, and labor models as the backbone has been quite common throughout the province, especially in the old areas. The combination of mutual aid groups and improved technology has broken the masses' conservative idea of "no harvest of a hundred dan of grain without planting a hundred mu of land" and increased everyone's confidence in striving for high yields. (2) About 100,000 mutual aid groups in the province have implemented the combination of agriculture and sideline production. Most mutual aid groups have processed the land and invested the surplus labor force in sideline production, and then used most of the income from sideline production to expand reproduction. However, some mutual aid groups have engaged in speculative commercial activities in the name of operating sideline production. This phenomenon must be corrected. (3) About 20,000 mutual aid groups in Changzhi Prefecture have established contractual relationships with supply and marketing cooperatives. Some have signed pre-purchase and credit purchase contracts, and some have signed joint contracts. 419 groups in Jiaocheng have signed production and sales contracts and pre-purchase contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels guarantee the consignment of cotton, grain, etc., worth 25.6 billion yuan, and the purchase of pesticides, agricultural tools, etc., worth 633.4 million yuan. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Gaoping supply mutual aid groups with 150 new-style walking plows, 50 weeding machines and sprayers each, 150 waterwheels, 35 corn threshers, 150 thermometers, 2,000 jin of pesticides, and 25,000 jin of fertilizer through contractual relationships. The combination of mutual aid groups and supply and marketing cooperatives has expanded the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthened the planning of mutual aid group production. This has a decisive effect on consolidating mutual aid groups.

V. The mutual aid movement in the new areas is developing rapidly. In the past six months, the number of mutual aid groups in the new areas of Shanxi Province has doubled to one and a half times. Some mutual aid groups have accumulated public property from the beginning and demanded the implementation of the "three major combinations." This is very different from the situation in the old areas in the past. The leadership must pay great attention to this feature, otherwise it will not be able to lead the rapid development of the mutual aid group movement in the new areas.

Reasons and experience for achieving results

I. Strengthen political and ideological leadership for rural party members, cadres, and peasants. Aiming at the right-leaning ideology existing among rural party members, cadres, and peasants, as well as the phenomenon that many party members and cadres do not participate in mutual aid groups, we universally mobilized rural party members, cadres, and mutual aid groups to study Comrade Gao Gang's report "On the Direction of Rural Economic Development" and launched a criticism of "Guo Jinyu Thought"; at the same time, we also widely carried out patriotic, collectivist, and socialist future education. As a result, the political consciousness and class consciousness of party members, cadres, and the broad masses of peasants have been further improved, enabling them to clarify the direction of rural development and the path they should take, and basically correct capitalist ideological tendencies; many people have joined mutual aid groups or returned to mutual aid groups, and the political situation in rural areas has undergone great changes. According to 48 branches in Yuncheng Prefecture with a total of 326 party members, the number of party members participating in mutual aid groups increased from 121 last year to 247 this year. In Quwo, Xinjiang, Yi's and other counties, the number of party members participating in mutual aid groups increased from only 31.2% last year to 73.9% this year. In the twelve counties of Changzhi Prefecture, the number of party members participating in mutual aid groups increased from only 46.6% last year to 91.3% this year. Under the leading influence of party members, the labor force organized in the whole region increased from 52.3% last year to 78.9% this year. At present, in some areas with weak work foundations and in some mutual aid groups, there is still a tendency to develop towards capitalism. Some mutual aid groups in Jiaocheng and Huguan are still using the name of sideline production to borrow money from the government for commercial activities; some district and village cadres also mistakenly believe that "new democratic society allows exploitation, and mutual aid groups can increase income by engaging in commerce." More seriously, some groups have been usurped by landlords, rich peasant elements, and reactionary elements. In Denglin Village, Zhao City, 24 landlords, rich peasant elements, and reactionary elements sneaked into 42 mutual aid groups, and 8 of them became group leaders. They used the peasants' agricultural tools and ridiculed the peasants, saying, "You have turned over, got the fruits, and still can't do anything about it?" Although this phenomenon is not universal, it should arouse our high vigilance. We must continue to strengthen the education of patriotism, collectivism, and socialist future for peasants, further improve the political consciousness and class consciousness of peasants, better combine peasants' production enthusiasm with patriotic enthusiasm, and continue to fight against all capitalist tendencies and right-leaning ideas in rural areas, and further develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

II. Use the methods of mutual aid representative meetings and mutual aid group leader training classes to cultivate a large number of backbones. At the mutual aid representative meetings, the mutual aid experience was widely exchanged, the wisdom of the masses was brought into play, and the difficulty of cadres lacking experience was overcome. This spring, all prefectures and counties held mutual aid representative meetings and held mutual aid training classes. More than 140,000 village cadres, labor models, mutual aid group leaders, party members, league members, and women cadres participated, and these people generally became backbone members of the mutual aid movement. Agricultural leading organs at all levels should make this form a leading system; and use methods such as "training stations," "observation," and "evaluation" to widely promote and exchange mutual aid experience. The experience of holding representative meetings well is: the meeting must have a center, full preparation must be made before the meeting, democracy must be fully promoted at the meeting, and leaders must participate personally.

III. Mutual aid and cooperation movement is closely combined with the patriotic production increase competition movement. This year, 180,000 mutual aid units and 10,000 individual farmers in the province responded to the patriotic production increase competition jointly initiated by national famous labor models and high-yield farms, forming a province-wide chain competition. This competition was launched on the basis of rectifying mutual aid and convening mutual aid group representative meetings. The content of the competition is to increase overall production or increase the production of a single crop. Farmers all understand the principle that in order to achieve the goal of increasing production, they must be organized. Therefore, under the promotion of the patriotic production increase competition movement, mutual aid groups have been developed and improved.

IV. Strong economic support from the state. This spring, the state loaned Shanxi farmers 86.874 million jin of fertilizer, 10,367 waterwheels, 740,000 jin of pesticides, 18,913 new-style agricultural tools, and 61,640 sprayers. Most of these means of production were loaned to organized farmers and became their public property. Therefore, the economic foundation of collectivism in mutual aid groups has been enhanced, which plays a great role in consolidating and developing mutual aid groups.

Problems to be paid attention to in leading mutual aid in the future

In the future, in leading the mutual aid movement, in addition to continuing to strengthen political and ideological leadership for rural areas, better using the experience of mutual aid representative meetings, more widely and deeply launching and organizing the patriotic production increase competition movement, and carrying out strong economic support, the leadership must also pay attention to the following two problems:

I. Overcome empiricism and strengthen the research on the characteristics of the mutual aid movement in the new areas. The foundation of the mutual aid movement in the new areas is different from that in the old areas, and its development process and development law are also different from those in the old areas. Agricultural production in the new areas is carried out in a peaceful and stable environment after land reform, and it has quickly recovered to or exceeded the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, farmers in the new areas demand to develop production from the beginning, rather than overcoming the difficulties of labor and animal power. Therefore, the slogan "organize to overcome the difficulties of labor and animal power" has little or no effect on them. Farmers in the new areas demand to be fully organized from the beginning, and demand that mutual aid groups be combined with improving technology, operating sideline production, and supply and marketing; and demand a large amount of economic support from the state. However, many of our comrades do not see this feature, but are bound by the old experience of the old areas, and dare not boldly let go to lead the mutual aid groups in the new areas to add new content in a timely manner, and still adopt a set of methods such as: "allocate work first, then mutual aid." This empiricist approach will make the leadership lag behind the masses and make the mutual aid movement in the new areas fall into spontaneity.

II. Deeply lead and overcome bureaucratic work style. At present, the biggest shortcoming of the leadership is that it only understands the general situation of the mutual aid movement, lacks in-depth investigation and research and specific analysis, and fails to grasp the essence of the problem, which often leads to passivity and weak guidance. This makes the leadership lag behind the requirements of the masses and the development of the movement. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and improve the leading organization of mutual aid and cooperation, strengthen investigation and research work, grasp typical examples, summarize experience, and effectively guide the movement forward.

III. Face the weak areas and overcome the imbalance phenomenon. Although the organized farmers in the province have reached 56.3%, the development of the mutual aid movement is unbalanced. The farmers organized in the counties with good work have reached more than 90%, but the farmers organized in a few counties are still less than 20%. Therefore, the leading comrades in the relevant areas must pay high attention to this issue, immediately send strong and capable cadres to go deep into the weak areas, strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid movement in these areas, so as to quickly change this unbalanced phenomenon.

    山西省互助运动中出现的新情况和今后应注意解决的问题
    山西省人民政府农业厅
    今年前半年山西省的互助组织在数量上、质量上都有很大的发展和提高。农民的互助经济在农村中已占优势。全省现有各种类型的互助组二十八万零五百九十个，参加的男女劳动力共二百五十八万五千七百五十个，占农村劳动力总数百分之五十六点三（包括农业生产合作社在内），比去年增加百分之七十九。常年互助组去年占互助组总数的百分之二十，今年增加到百分之三十五点九。多数常年互助组已经订出了全年的或季节的生产计划，都能坚持自愿互利原则，对参加互助组的男女劳动力开始实行同工同酬，并把生产活动和政治学习紧密结合起来，用“读报组”、“爱国检查日”、“爱国生产俱乐部”等形式，经常对组员进行爱国主义和集体主义的教育。这一类型的互助组中，有一部分是历史较长、经验较多、骨干较强、并积累了一部分公共财产的，它们已不满足于现在的互助形式，正积极创造条件，准备发展为农业生产合作社。在一些工作基础薄弱的地区，今年发展了相当数量的季节性、临时性的互助组。这类互助组缺乏领导骨干和互助经验，没有生产计划，也还没有建立健全的制度。它的一般特点是“农忙互助农闲散”，或是“农业互助、副业单干”。这一类型的互助组需要加强领导，积极提高。特别值得注意的是少数地区至今仍然有不少有名无实的形式组，这种形式组不仅在生产上不起作用，而且对群众影响很坏，这种情况应该改变。
    今年互助运动的新特点
    一、常年互助组增加，季节性临时性互助组相对减少，并出现了并组、联组的新情况。例如，去年运城专区的常年互助组只占互助组织总数的百分之九点六，今年已增加到百分之五十以上。襄垣县有一千多个临时组上升为常年互助组。长治、榆次两专区互助基础较好的地区，有许多互助组发展扩大了，组内的户数增加了，有的已并在或联在一起。互助组扩大的结果：（一）给农业生产合作社准备了基础；（二）进一步扩大了投资，发展了生产；
    （三）更合理地使用和调配了劳力。
    二、互助组的公共财产大量增加，土地的基本建设已被重视。交城三百五十八个组今年积累的公共财产有：新式步犁四十一张，水车十部，喷雾器一百三十六台，轧花机二十五台，公积金七百五十万元，义仓粮三千六百零七斤，土地四百八十九亩八分，连同上年积累的公共财产共合人民币两亿多元。壶关流泽，黎城王家庄、霍家窑，平顺西沟、川底，榆社大寨，兴县白家沟等村的农业生产合作社和互助组，利用剩余劳力进行了许多土地上的基本建设工作，从春季到现在，共打水井七眼、旱井二十眼，挖旱池六个、活水池三个、蓄水池十五个、卧牛坑九十二个和小型渠道四十九条；又合作造林三百五十亩零一万多株，集体植树八千八百零六株。公共财产的增加和土地基本建设工作的被重视，充分地说明互助组内集体主义思想和向自然斗争的思想已逐渐增长。
    三、互助组的生产计划性加强了。长治专区已有一万零五百个互助组订了增产计划。平顺有五千七百个互助组参加了爱国增产竞赛，其中有两千七百零一十二个组订有长年计划。晋城参加竞赛的七千零二十二个组中，订两年计划的有一百零八个组，订一年计划的有三千一百四十个组。为了实现生产计划，许多组订了“爱国公约”，采用“长计划、短安排”的办法，初步克服了生产中的盲目性。
    四、互助组内的“三大结合”进一步发展了。（一）目前全省有百分之三十到四十的互助组注意了提高技术。这些互助组大部分建立了“小农场”和“丰产地”。黎城有一千三百三十一个组有高额丰产地。交城有一千零九十八个组设有技术员，有二百八十六个组有小农场。以农场为核心、互助组为基础、劳动模范为骨干的“技术传授网”，在全省特别是老区已相当普遍地建立起来。互助组与提高技术相结合的结果，打破了群众的“不种百亩地，不收百石粮”的保守思想，提高了大家争取高额产量的信心。（二）全省约有十万个互助组实行了农副业结合。大部分互助组对土地进行了加工，并把剩余劳动力投入了副业生产，然后把副业生产的大部分收入拿到扩大再生产方面去。但也有一些互助组以经营副业为名，贷款进行投机商业活动。这种现象必须纠正。（三）长治专区约有两万个互助组和供销社建立了合同关系。有的订立了预购、赊购合同，有的订立了结合合同。交城有四百一十九个组和供销社订立了产销合同和预购合同，各级供销社保证代销棉、粮等价值二百五十六亿元，代买农药、农具等价值六亿三千三百四十万元。高平各级供销社通过合同关系供应互助组新式步犁一百五十部，锄草机、喷雾器各五十部，水车一百五十部，玉米脱粒机三十五部，温度计一百五十支，农药二千斤，肥料两万五千斤。互助组与供销合作社结合的结果，扩大了城乡物资交流，巩固了工农联盟，加强了互助组生产的计划性。这对巩固互助组有决定性的作用。
    五、新区互助运动迅速发展。半年来，山西省新区互助组的数量发展了一倍到一倍半。有些互助组一开始就积累了公共财产，并要求实行“三大结合”。这是和过去老区的情况大不相同的。领导方面必须十分重视这个特点，否则即无法领导新区互助组运动的迅速向前发展。
    取得成绩的原因和经验
    一、加强对农村党员、干部和农民的政治思想领导。我们针对农村党员、干部和农民存在的右倾思想，以及许多党员、干部不参加互助组的现象，普遍发动农村党员、干部和互助组学习了高岗同志“关于农村经济发展的方向问题”的报告，展开了对“郭金玉思想”的批判；同时又广泛地进行了爱国主义、集体主义和向社会主义社会发展的前途教育。这样做的结果，进一步提高了党员、干部和广大农民的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟，使他们明确了农村发展方向及自己应走的道路，基本上纠正了资本主义思想倾向；许多人参加了互助组或重新回到互助组，农村的政治情况有了很大的变化。据运城专区四十八个支部共有三百二十六个党员，去年参加互助组的一百二十一人，今年增加到二百四十七人。曲沃、新绛、猗氏等县去年参加互助组的党员只有百分之三十一点二，今年增加到百分之七十三点九。长治专区十二个县去年参加互助组的党员只有百分之四十六点六，今年增加到百分之九十一点三。在党员的带头影响下，全区组织起来的劳力由去年的百分之五十二点三增加到今年的百分之七十八点九。现在一些工作基础薄弱的地区和一些互助组中，仍然存在着向资本主义发展的倾向。交城、壶关有些互助组还在假副业生产之名，向政府贷款进行商业活动；有些区村干部还错误地认为：“新民主主义社会允许剥削，互助组搞商业能够增加收入。”更严重的是，有些组已被地主富农分子和反动分子篡夺了领导权，赵城登临村四十二个互助组中，就钻进二十四个地主、富农分子和反动分子，并有八个当了组长。他们使用农民的农具，还讽刺农民说：“你们翻身了，得了果实，还能没办法吗？”这种现象虽然不是普遍的，但应引起我们高度警惕。我们必须继续加强对农民的爱国主义、集体主义和社会主义前途的教育，进一步提高农民的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟，把农民的生产积极性与爱国热情更好地结合起来，继续向农村中一切资本主义倾向和右倾思想斗争，把互助合作运动进一步地开展起来。
    二、运用互助代表会议和互助组长训练班的方式培养大批骨干。在互助代表会议上，广泛地交流了互助经验，发挥了群众的智慧，克服了干部缺乏经验的困难。今春各专区各县都召开了互助代表会议，举办了互助训练班。参加的村干部、劳动模范、互助组长、党员、团员和妇女干部达十四万余人，这些人一般都成了互助运动中的骨干分子。各级农业领导机关应把这一形式订为一个领导制度；并应用“传授站”、“观摩”、“评比”等办法，广泛地推广和交流互助经验。开好代表会的经验是：会议要有中心，会前要充分准备，会上充分发扬民主，领导人亲自参加。
    三、互助合作运动与爱国增产竞赛运动紧密结合。今年全省响应全国著名劳动模范和丰产农场联名发起的爱国增产竞赛的，共有十八万个互助单位成万个单干农民，形成了全省规模的连环竞赛。这一竞赛是在整顿互助、召开互助组代表会的基础上开展起来的。竞赛内容却是以全面增产或单一作物增产为条件。农民都懂得了要想达到增产的目的，必须组织起来的道理，因此，在爱国增产竞赛运动的推动下，又发展了和提高了互助组。
    四、国家经济的大力扶持。今年春季，国家贷给山西农民的肥料有八千六百八十七万四千斤，水车
    一万零三百六十七部、农药七十四万斤、新式农具一万八千九百一十三部、喷雾器六万一千六百四十台。这些生产资料，大部分贷给了组织起来的农民，并成为他们的公共财产。因此，增强了互助组的集体主义的经济基础，对巩固和发展互助组作用极大。
    今后领导互助中应注意的问题
    今后在领导互助运动中，除应继续加强对农村的政治思想领导，更好地运用互助代表会议的经验，更广泛地深入地发动和组织爱国增产竞赛运动及进行有力的经济扶持之外，领导方面还必须注意如下两个问题：
    一、克服经验主义，加强对新区互助运动特点的研究。新区互助运动的基础和老区不同，它的发展过程和发展规律也和老区不同。新区的农业生产是在土地改革之后在和平安定的环境下进行的，而且很快地就已恢复到或已超过抗日战争以前的水平，因此新区的农民一开始就要求发展生产，而不是克服劳力、畜力的困难。所以“组织起来克服劳畜力困难”的口号对他们是作用不大甚至不起作用。新区农民一开始就要求全面地组织起来，要求互助组与提高技术、经营副业及供销相结合；要求国家大量的经济扶持。但我们许多同志看不到这个特点，而拘泥于老区的旧经验，不敢大胆放手地领导新区互助组及时增加新的内容，仍然是采用：“先拨工、再互助”等一套办法。这种经验主义的作法，将使领导落在群众后面，而使新区的互助运动陷于自流。
    二、深入领导克服官僚主义作风。目前领导方面的最大缺点是对互助运动只了解一般概况，缺乏深入地调查研究和具体的分析，抓不住问题的本质，往往形成被动，指导无力。使领导落后于群众的要求和运动的发展。为此，必须建立与健全互助合作的领导机构，加强调查研究工作，掌握典型，总结经验，有效地指导运动向前发展。
    三、面向薄弱区，克服不平衡现象。全省组织起的农民虽已达到百分之五十六点三，但互助运动的发展是不平衡的。工作好的县组织起来的农民已达百分之九十以上，但有少数县份组织起来的农民还不到百分之二十。因此，有关地区的领导同志，必须高度重视这一问题，立即派出强有力的干部，深入薄弱区，加强对这种地区的互助运动的领导，以便迅速改变这种不平衡的现象。
