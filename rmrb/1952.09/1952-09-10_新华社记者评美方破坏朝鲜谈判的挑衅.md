Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 9th: A special correspondent of this agency commented on the US side bearing full responsibility for disrupting the Korean armistice negotiations, stating: Due to the US side's sixth request for a week-long recess at Panmunjom, the fate of the Korean armistice negotiations is hanging by a thread. If the fourteen months of negotiations finally break down, the US side must bear full responsibility. Harrison, with a guilty conscience, claimed at the conference on the 4th that "it is useless to negotiate with the Communists on any reasonable and honorable basis." This lie, calling white black, cannot alleviate the US side's serious responsibility in the slightest.

    The facts of the last three months, in particular, clearly prove that it is our side that has consistently adhered to negotiations and insisted on resolving the issue of prisoner repatriation in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention during the negotiations; while Harrison's "American way of negotiating on a reasonable and honorable basis" is the blackmail of the Chicago underworld, using prisoners of war for New York Stock Exchange-style trading.

    Let all prisoners of war go home, and an armistice in Korea immediately. This is our side's consistent and clear position. The rationality and conformity of this principle with international law are so obvious that no one with a clear conscience would doubt it. According to this principle, captured personnel of the Korean People's Army whose homes are in North Korea must be repatriated, and all captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers must be repatriated; the number of our prisoners of war that the US side should repatriate must be close to 116,000. However, the US side has spread a pack of lies, saying that if all prisoners of war were to go home, tens of thousands of prisoners of war would commit suicide. Harrison originally fabricated that only 70,000 prisoners of war "were willing to be repatriated," but later suddenly changed his tune, saying it was 83,000. According to Harrison's claim, the prisoners of war "are all ordinary people, mostly the lowest-ranking soldiers in your army," as if the US side could freely detain them. Harrison attempts to have our side abandon principles and engage in population trading with him. This is the essence of the issue obstructing the Korean armistice today.

    The massacres constantly occurring on Geoje Island and other US prisoner-of-war camps shattered the US side's propaganda lies about prisoners of war "refusing repatriation." The US side, having exhausted its arguments and become angry and embarrassed, resorted to various obstructionist and provocative means inside and outside the conference,妄想attempting to use the disruption of negotiations and the expansion of the war to blackmail and intimidate us.

    The US representatives first refused to negotiate, claiming day after day that their proposition for detaining prisoners of war was "final and unchangeable." Later, Harrison went even further and simply refused to meet, repeatedly employing the notorious methods of fleeing the meeting hall midway and unilaterally adjourning the meeting, followed by consistently insisting on a week-long recess. And when he returned to Panmunjom once a week, he merely recited slanderous tunes habitually used by "Voice of America," shamelessly threatening to subject the Korean people to "disease, displacement," and "pain and irreparable damage."

    Outside the conference, the US side's provocative acts have been emerging one after another since the US air force's indiscriminate bombing of the Supung Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Korean-Chinese border at the end of June. They have not only been frantically bombing peaceful towns in Korea, but also continuously sending aircraft to intrude into Chinese airspace. The US Navy has even blatantly sailed near Chinese territorial waters, openly proclaiming that it was conducting a "demonstration." At the same time, the "military pressure" slanders and war-mongering cries of American generals have been echoing each other like frogs in the fields after the rain. As recently as a week ago, the commander of the 1st Marine Division of the United States, Pollock, shouted: "If we are ordered to carry out a landing, we can do it." At the same time, US aircraft indiscriminately bombed peaceful towns on the Korean-Soviet and Korean-Chinese borders. 7th Fleet Commander Clark hysterically said: "This is a signal to the Communists that we really want to do something."

    In the prisoner-of-war camps, the US side, disregarding our repeated protests, continues to wantonly massacre prisoners of war. In the period from August 11 to September 1 alone, US news agencies revealed that 126 of our captured personnel were killed or wounded.

    In addition, the US side has repeatedly violated the neutralization agreement of the conference area in the past three months, and has been increasingly blatantly using the conference area for espionage activities.

    Despite the US side's various provocations inside and outside the conference, our side still insists on negotiations and solving problems through negotiations. The most obvious example is when the US side claimed in early July that it was seeking a "solution that reasonably meets the needs of both sides," our side suggested convening administrative meetings to conduct substantive discussions. The eighteen days of administrative meetings proved that Harrison's words were false, proving that although the US side agreed to the clause in the armistice agreement draft regarding the repatriation of all prisoners of war, it was unwilling to fulfill this principle, and instead proposed "voluntary repatriation" or "opposing forced repatriation" to undermine this principle.

    Harrison's so-called "negotiations conducted on a reasonable and honorable basis" are nothing but such blackmail, deception, and population trading. Today, the Korean armistice negotiations are in dire straits, entirely as a result of this "American way of negotiating."

### 新华社记者评美方破坏朝鲜谈判的挑衅

    新华社记者评美方破坏朝鲜谈判的挑衅
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者评美方应负破坏朝鲜停战谈判的全部责任称：由于美方在板门店第六次要求休会一周，朝鲜停战谈判的命运已经不绝如缕。如果十四个月的谈判终于最后破裂，美方必须担负全部责任。做贼心虚的哈利逊在四日的大会上说什么“想和共产党在任何合理和荣誉的基础上进行谈判都是无用的”，这种指白为黑的谎言，绝不能丝毫减轻美方的严重责任。
    最近三个月来的事实，尤其清楚地证明了正是我方一贯坚持谈判，并坚持在谈判中按日内瓦公约的原则解决遣俘问题；而哈利逊所采取的“在合理和荣誉基础上进行的”美国谈判方式，却是芝加哥流氓世界的讹诈，是用战俘进行纽约证券交易所式的买卖。
    让所有战俘回家，朝鲜立刻停战，这是我方一贯的明确立场。这一原则之合情合理与符合国际公法是如此明显，任何良心清白的人都不会怀疑。根据这一原则，家在北朝鲜的朝鲜人民军被俘人员必须遣返，所有中国人民志愿军被俘人员必须遣返；美方应遣返我方的战俘数字必须接近十一万六千人。而美方却撒下漫天大谎，说如果要让所有战俘回家，成万的战俘就会自杀。哈利逊原先捏造说“愿意遣返”的战俘只有七万人，后来又突然改口说是八万三千人。按照哈利逊的说法，战俘“都是普通人，大部分是你们军队里最下级的士兵”，似乎尽可听任美方扣留。哈利逊企图要我方放弃原则，与他进行人口交易，这就是今天阻挠朝鲜停战的问题的实质。
    巨济岛及其它美方战俘营中不断发生的屠杀事件，粉碎了美方所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的宣传骗局。美方词屈理穷，恼羞成怒，遂在会内会外采取了各种各样的阻挠和挑衅手段，妄想以破坏谈判、扩大战争来进行讹诈和恫吓。
    美方代表首先拒绝谈判，日复一日地声称他们扣留战俘的主张是“最后的、不可改变的”。到后来，哈利逊更进一步根本拒绝开会，多次采用了臭名远扬的中途逃离会场、片面休会的办法，接着又连续坚持休会一星期。而当他一周一次回到板门店来时，他也只是背诵一些“美国之音”所惯用的诬蔑谰调，并无耻地威胁要使朝鲜人民遭受“疾病、流离失所”，“痛苦与不可弥补的损害”。
    在会外，自六月底美机滥炸朝中边境的水丰发电厂以来，美方的挑衅行为层出不穷。他们不但疯狂地轰炸朝鲜和平城镇，而且不断地派遣飞机侵入中国领空。美国海军更明目张胆地驶到中国领海附近，公开扬言是举行“示威”。同时，美国将军们的“军事压力”的谰调和扩大战争的叫嚣，一如雨后田间的蛤蟆，此呼彼应。近如一星期以前，美国海军陆战队第一师师长波乐克叫喊道：“如果我们奉令实行登陆，我们就能做到。”同时，美机又滥炸朝苏及朝中边境的和平城镇。第七舰队司令寇拉克歇斯底里地说：“这是对共产党发出信号，表示我们真是要干一下。”
    在战俘营，美方不顾我方历次抗议，继续恣意屠杀战俘。仅仅八月十一至九月一日这一段时期，美方通讯社报道就透露了我方被俘人员被打死打伤一百二十六人。
    此外，美方在最近三个月来更多次破坏会场区的中立化协议，并越来越放肆地利用会场区进行特务活动。
    尽管美方在会内会外进行种种挑衅，我方仍然坚持谈判，并坚持在谈判中解决问题。最明显的例子是当七月初美方声称要寻求一个“在合理程度上适合双方需要的解决”时，我方就建议召开行政性会议，进行切实的讨论。十八天的行政性会议证明哈利逊的话是虚伪的，证明美方虽然同意停战协定草案中关于遣返全部战俘的条文，但并不愿意履行这个原则，反而提出什么“自愿遣返”或“反对强迫遣返”来破坏这个原则。
    哈利逊的所谓“在合理和荣誉的基础上进行的谈判”，就是这样的讹诈欺骗与人口买卖。今天朝鲜停战谈判陷于千钧一发，完全是这种“美国谈判方式”的结果。
