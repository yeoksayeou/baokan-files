Editor's Note: In order to ensure that the mass criticism carried out in newspapers can more effectively become a force for promoting the improvement of work, we wrote to more than one hundred readers in early September who had previously made criticisms and suggestions in this newspaper, asking them to tell us the actual effect after the criticism. As of September 18, we have received twelve reply letters from readers. Judging from these letters, most of the reader criticism letters published in the newspaper have played a role and improved the work. For example, after industrial labor model Li Xiaying raised the issue of excessive working hours for workers at the Lixin Yarn Factory in Wuxi City (original letter published in the "Readers' Letters" column on May 15), it attracted the attention of the local leading organs, and many yarn factories in Wuxi City carried out working hour reforms. The worker masses were very excited, and their production enthusiasm and efficiency were improved. After readers Zhong Yuan and five others criticized the Henan Huangchuan Special District People's Hospital for neglecting human life and other situations (original criticism letter published in the "Readers' Letters" column on April 1), the Henan Provincial People's Government has inspected the work of the hospital and dealt with the personnel involved. Now the work of the hospital has been greatly improved, the medical staff is more responsible than before, and the patients are unanimously satisfied. Other issues such as the obstruction of the promotion of the 1951 weaving work method by leading cadres of the state-owned Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory, the people of Mentougou requesting tap water, the Xizhimen General Affairs Station requesting the construction of toilets in the freight yard, and the employees of the Ningyuan Dormitory of the Tianjin Railway Administration requesting the improvement of canteen management, have also been resolved after criticism was raised in the newspaper.

However, there are still individual units that have adopted an erroneous attitude towards the criticism raised in the newspaper. Although they declared in the newspaper that they accepted the criticism and proposed methods for correcting the errors, the actual work remained the same. If this erroneous attitude towards criticism is not corrected, it will greatly weaken the combat effectiveness of criticism and self-criticism, and affect the enthusiasm of the people in caring about national affairs and the connection between the Party and the people. We are now publishing a letter from a reader exposing the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau's erroneous attitude towards criticism and self-criticism below, asking them to seriously examine this erroneous attitude, accept readers' opinions and earnestly improve their work; and suggest that their superior organs seriously deal with the erroneous behavior of the sub-bureau.

In order for the mass criticism carried out in newspapers to play its due role, in addition to Party organizations at all levels educating their subordinate cadres to correctly treat criticism and self-criticism, mass supervision is also an important condition. We ask the broad masses of readers to boldly expose the phenomenon of adopting erroneous attitudes towards mass criticism. We will certainly support this reasonable action and wage an uncompromising struggle against erroneous behavior in dealing with criticism.

Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau should not ignore the criticism of the newspaper

Comrades Editors: Received your letter checking the effect of the criticism. The problem that my company criticized the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau for stopping the construction of a turnout special line in December of last year, which increased our annual transportation expenses by more than 3 billion yuan, which was published in the "Readers' Letters" column on April 2, has not been resolved as of September 13. Now we are telling you the situation, hoping to continue to assist in solving it.

Before July, the Central Ministry of Trade, the North China Trade Bureau, the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce, the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company General Corporation, the North China Regional Company, the Hebei Provincial Company, and the Xingtai Finance and Economics Committee Industry and Commerce Section sent people to my office to investigate and unanimously agreed that it was necessary for my company to build turnouts. Therefore, the Central Finance and Economics Committee approved my company to build again in July.

On July 22, after receiving instructions from the superior company, we immediately studied with the Xingtai Finance and Economics Committee and contacted the Xingtai Works Section of the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau. At that time, the person in charge of the section said: "The direct instructions from the superior railway bureau have not yet been issued, and construction cannot be resumed." After several contacts, the problem still could not be solved. In late August, the Hebei Provincial Company of Coal Construction Company and the Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce successively notified us to urge the relevant railway bureau to rush to handle construction procedures. According to Comrade Cheng of the Xingtai Works Section, "The Tianjin Railway Administration has issued instructions to the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau." We then urged the Xingtai Works Section to contact the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau for three days on September 10, 11, and 12. They made three phone calls to Shijiazhuang. However, the Shijiazhuang Sub-bureau said that they "could not find the person in charge," so the problem was still not resolved. We request the People's Daily to urge the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau to immediately check and correct this bureaucratic attitude and quickly carry out construction.

### 应该正确地对待批评和自我批评

专栏：

    应该正确地对待批评和自我批评
    编者按：为了保证在报纸上开展的群众性的批评能够更有效地成为推动改进工作的力量，我们在九月上旬给一百多位曾经在本报提过批评建议的读者写了信，要求他们将批评后的实际效果告诉我们。到九月十八日为止，我们已经收到读者复信十二封。从这些来信看，报纸上所发表的大部分的读者批评信件已经起了作用，使工作得到了改进。如工业劳动模范李霞影提出了无锡市丽新纱厂工人工时过长的问题后（原信刊五月十五日“读者来信”栏），引起了当地领导机关的重视，无锡市很多纱厂都进行了工时改革。工人群众都很兴奋，生产情绪和生产效率都提高了。读者中原等六人批评河南潢川专区人民医院玩忽人命等情况后（原批评信刊四月一日“读者来信”栏），河南省人民政府已对该院工作作了检查，并对有关人员进行了处理。现在该院工作已有了很大的改进，医务人员比以前负责任，病人一致感到满意。其他像国营青岛第八棉纺织厂领导干部阻碍一九五一织布工作法推行的问题、门头沟人民要求饮用自来水的问题、西直门总务站要求修建货场厕所问题和天津铁路管理局宁园宿舍职工要求改善食堂管理的问题等，经报纸提出批评后，也都得到了解决。
    但是还有个别单位对报纸上提出的批评采取了错误的态度。他们虽然在报纸上声明接受批评，并提出了改正错误的办法，但实际工作却依旧如故。这种对待批评的错误态度如果不加以纠正，就会使批评与自我批评的战斗力大大削弱，并影响到人民群众关心国家事业的积极性、影响到党和人民群众的联系。我们现在把读者揭发石家庄铁路分局以错误态度对待批评和自我批评的来信发表于后，要求他们认真检查这种错误态度，接受读者意见切实改进工作；并建议其上级机关对该分局的错误行为作严正处理。
    要使报纸上开展的群众性的批评能够起到应有的作用，除各级党组织应教育所属干部正确地对待批评与自我批评外，群众性的监督也是一个重要的条件。我们要求广大读者大胆地揭发对待群众批评采取错误态度的现象。我们一定支持这种合理的行动，向对待批评的错误行为作不妥协的斗争。
    石家庄铁路分局不应对报纸的批评置之不理
    编辑同志：收到你们检查批评效果的来信。四月二日“读者来信”栏刊载了我公司批评石家庄铁路分局在去年十二月停建道岔专用线，使我们每年增加运费开支三十多亿元的信后，到九月十三日为止，这个问题仍未得到解决。现在我们把情况告诉你们，希望继续协助解决。
    七月份以前，中央贸易部、华北贸易局和河北省商业厅，中国煤业建筑器材公司总公司、华北区公司和河北省公司，以及邢台财经委员会工商科先后派人来我处调查，一致认为我公司修建道岔是必要的。因此，中央财经委员会在七月份再次批准我公司修建。
    七月二十二日，我们接到上级公司指示后，立即与邢台财经委员会研究，并和石家庄铁路分局邢台工务段联系。当时该段负责人谈：“上级路局直接指示尚未下达，不能复工。”后又经数次联系，问题仍不能解决。八月下旬，煤建公司河北省公司和河北省人民政府商业厅先后通知我们催促有关路局赶办施工手续。据邢台工务段程同志谈：“天津铁路管理局已有指示下达石家庄铁路分局。”我们接着在九月十日、十一日、十二日三天催促邢台工务段与石家庄铁路分局联系。他们打了三次电话给石家庄。而石家庄分局说是“找不到负责人”，因而问题仍未解决。我们要求人民日报社督促石家庄铁路分局立即检查改正这种官僚主义态度，迅速施工修建。
