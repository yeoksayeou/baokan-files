    We Learned the Experience of Not Setting Off Duds
    Editor: I am a worker from the Third Production Group of the Chengzi Coal Mine in West Beijing. In early February of this year, Engineer Zhang from our mine introduced us to the advanced experience of the Twelfth Group in preventing duds. At the time, due to conservative thinking, my fellow workers and I did not study their methods. We thought their methods might not be correct, and we certainly did not immediately learn from this experience. However, we continued to have duds, and one day we had three, which greatly affected production. Later, Engineer Zhang criticized and educated us for our mistake of not accepting advanced experience. We accepted his criticism and resolved to learn the advanced methods of the Twelfth Group. We made the tools that day and began to bind the fuses. In order to make the whole team, especially the drilling workers, accept this advanced experience through concrete facts, we did a small experiment while waiting for the blasts to go off and the smoke to clear. Everyone saw with their own eyes that the fuse with the hole could avoid duds, and they were no longer conservative. Since we implemented this advanced experience, we have not had a single dud, which has created favorable conditions for our mine's production increase and frugality campaign.

    我们学会了不瞎炮的经验
    编辑同志：我是京西城子矿生产第三组的工人。今年二月初，我们矿的张工程师向我们介绍了我矿十二组防止瞎炮的先进经验。当时因为保守思想作怪，我和工友们没有研究人家的办法，就认为他们的办法不一定对，更没有马上学习这个经验。但我们还是不断的瞎炮，有一天瞎了三个炮，生产受到了很大影响。后来，张工程师对我们不接受先进经验的错误进行了批评和教育。我们接受了他的批评，决心学习十二组的先进办法，当天就做好工具，开始扎导火线。为了使全班特别是打眼工人通过具体事实接受这个先进经验，我们在等待炮响与炮烟消散的时间，又做了一次小的试验。大家亲眼看到了扎了孔的导火线可以避免瞎炮，便不再保守了。自从我们实行了这个先进经验以来，再没有瞎过一次炮，给我们矿的增产节约运动创造了有利条件。
