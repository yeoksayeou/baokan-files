    The Cholera Incident of Zhao Wanfu in Datong County, North Korea
    On the night of May 16, 1952, at around 10 p.m., Choi Eung-ryang, the head of the self-defense force of a village in Datong County, and others heard an American plane circling above the area for more than an hour. It neither strafed nor bombed, as if its pilot was looking for something. The next morning, Li Yingzi, a resident of the village, found a grass-wrapped clam while picking wild vegetables on a nearby hillside. She picked up some clams, took them home, and ate them raw with her husband, Zhao Wanfu, for breakfast. That evening, both of them suddenly fell ill. On the evening of the 18th, Li Rinan, Li Yingzi's brother, returned home from Pyongyang. He called out his brother-in-law's name but received no answer, only a weak groan. When he entered the house, he found his sister unconscious and his brother-in-law in a dying state, who weakly told him about eating the clams. Zhao Wanfu and Li Yingzi died successively between 8:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. that night.
    Upon receiving the report, the anti-epidemic team of South Pyongan Province immediately went to the scene to investigate. They quarantined the area, carried out fly eradication and disinfection measures, and sent the deceased's feces, the leftover clams, and four packages of clams found by militiamen on the hillside to the anti-epidemic station for testing. An autopsy was performed on the bodies at the scene. The test results proved that the cause of death was cholera. It was also proven that all these clams were severely infected with Vibrio cholerae. Neighboring residents drank water from the same well as the patients, but none of them contracted the disease. No Vibrio cholerae was found in the well or in the reservoir near the village.
    A series of questions arose from this. How could clams, which are marine mollusks, appear on a hillside in the middle of the countryside? Why were the thick shells of many of the clams found on the hillside broken? In Korea, clams sold are not usually wrapped in rice straw, and they usually only appear in June. In fact, they have never been on the market since the war began. Moreover, in Korea, cholera has never been an endemic disease and rarely occurs before August. Therefore, how could these clams be infected with Vibrio cholerae?
    Witness testimonies showed that the place where the clams were found was about 400 meters from the pumping station on the hilltop. At the foot of the hill were six spring pools. Each pool was about 60 meters long and 60 meters wide (about the size of two large swimming pools). Pipes ran from the pools to the hilltop, and other pipes ran from the hilltop to the coastal towns. The distance between the pools and the pumping station was about one kilometer. The day before the clams were found, an American plane bombed the top of the hill with small bombs, accurately destroying the water purification equipment, but the pumping machine itself was intact. This shows that the American aggressors attempted to pollute the water source to kill large numbers of Korean people and Chinese and Korean People's forces. This conspiracy failed because the weather conditions on the night the clams were dropped prevented the pilot from finding these reservoirs.
    Professor Wei Xi, a bacteriological expert from the Chinese People's Volunteer Anti-epidemic and Inspection Team in Korea, showed in his research that Vibrio cholerae has the special property of being able to survive in higher concentrations of salt water. Vibrio cholerae can also live in fresh water for up to 30 days. In his book "Aquatic Microbiology," Mr. Tanikawa of Japan cited the experiments of Mr. Toyama, proving that Vibrio cholerae can multiply in large quantities in a type of sea clam.
    Based on careful scientific research, review, and analysis, the International Scientific Commission concluded: "The U.S. Air Force, according to a pre-determined and meticulous plan, first destroyed the Datong water filtration plant without damaging the pumping machine, and then attempted to contaminate the drinking reservoir with Vibrio cholerae. This young couple, impoverished by the ravages of war, inadvertently ate these clams, which were intended to be used as a germ-spreading medium, leading to their deaths." (Xinhua News Agency)

    朝鲜大同郡赵万福霍乱事件经过
    一九五二年五月十六日夜十时左右，大同郡某村自卫队队长崔膺亮等听见美国飞机一架，在该地上空盘旋在一小时以上，既未扫射，又未轰炸，好像它的驾驶员在寻找什么东西似的。第二天清晨，该村居民李英子在附近山坡上采野菜时，发现一个草包裹的蛤蜊。她拾了些蛤蜊回家，和她的丈夫赵万福当早餐生吃了。当天晚上两人突然发病。十八日晚上李英子的哥哥李日男从平壤回家时，他喊他妹夫的名字，没有得到回答，只听到微弱的呻吟。到了屋里，他发现他的妹妹已不省人事，妹夫在垂死状态中，有气无力地告诉了他吃蛤蜊的经过。当晚八时半和十一时之间赵万福和李英子先后死亡。
    平安南道的防疫队得到报告后即刻赴现场调查，一面将该地区隔离，进行了灭蝇和消毒等卫生措施，一面将死者的大便、吃剩的蛤蜊和民兵在山坡上找到的四包蛤蜊一并送防疫站检验。尸体在现场进行解剖。检验结果证明致死的原因是霍乱。同时也证明了所有这些蛤蜊都严重地感染了霍乱弧菌。邻近的居民与病者饮用同一水井的水，但都没有得病。在水井和该村附近的蓄水池中，也没有发现霍乱弧菌。
    一系列的疑问就由此产生了。蛤蜊是一种海洋软体动物，怎么会出现在乡村中间的山坡上？为什么许多在山坡上发现的蛤蜊的厚壳竟会摔破？在朝鲜，出卖的蛤蜊，通常不是用稻草包的，它们平常是在六月里才出现的。事实上，自从战争发生以来，它们就从未上过市。况且，在朝鲜，霍乱从来就不是地方流行病，而且很少在八月以前出现。因此，这些蛤蜊又怎么会感染上霍乱弧菌呢？
    证人的证词表明：发现蛤蜊的地方，距离山顶上的抽水站约四百公尺山脚下有六个泉水池。每一个水池约有六十公尺长，六十公尺宽（约有两个大型游泳池大）。有水管从水池通到山顶上，又有水管从山顶通到沿海的城镇。水池与抽水站之间的距离约有一公里。在发现蛤蜊的前一天，美国飞机曾轰炸山顶部分，用小型炸弹，准确地炸毁净水设备，但抽水机本身却完好无损。这说明了美国侵略者企图污染水源，来大量杀害朝鲜人民和中朝人民部队。这个阴谋之所以没有达到，是因为投掷蛤蜊的那天夜里的气候条件，使驾驶员不能找到这些蓄水池。
    在朝鲜的中国人民志愿防疫检验队的细菌学专家魏曦教授的研究表明：在较高浓度盐水中能够生存，这是霍乱弧菌的特殊性能。霍乱弧菌在淡水中也可以活到三十日之久。日本谷川氏著的水产细菌学一书，曾引用远山氏（Toyama）的实验，证明霍乱弧菌能在一种海蛤中大量繁殖。
    根据科学的缜密的研究、复查和分析，国际科学委员会得出下面的结论：“美国空军根据事先定好的一个缜密的计划，首先破坏大同的滤水厂而不损毁抽水机，然后企图用霍乱弧菌污染饮用的蓄水池。这一对年青的夫妇，由于战争的蹂躏而致穷困，因而不慎吃了这些意图用为散菌媒介的蛤蜊，以致死亡。”    （新华社）
