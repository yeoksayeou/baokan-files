    China Red Cross and others issue statements
    Protesting the US bombing of peaceful cities in Korea

    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] The China Red Cross issued a statement protesting the US aggressors' indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities in Korea. The text is as follows:
    In the past two years, the US army invading Korea has continuously violated and trampled on international humanitarian principles, illegally using gas bombs, napalm bombs, high-explosive bombs, and bacteriological weapons, massively slaughtering Korean peaceful people, and destroying Korean peaceful cities and towns. These ugly and inhumane acts have written the most cruel and humiliating page in human history!
    However, the US army invading Korea, while being unanimously and severely condemned by peace-loving and righteous people around the world, clamored to destroy 78 peaceful cities in North Korea from the air, more cruelly and massively slaughtering peaceful residents and destroying peaceful construction; and has repeatedly bombed residential areas of Pyongyang and hydroelectric plants in North Korea. This mad act of destruction is a direct attack on human justice and conscience.
    We Red Cross workers have the noble responsibility of upholding humanitarian principles and defending world peace. For the sake of the millions of mothers and children in Korea, for the dignity of the Geneva Conventions, we call on all Red Cross workers, Red Cross members, and all peace-loving and righteous people around the world to unite and stop this atrocity by the US military.
    President of the China Red Cross, Li Dequan

    [Xinhua News Agency] The Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christian Church issued a statement on the 30th, protesting against the US imperialists' indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities in Korea. The statement said: We lodge a serious protest against the US aerial bandits' plan to bomb 78 peaceful Korean cities and the recent bloody crimes of indiscriminate bombing of Pyongyang and other places. We believe that this atrocity by US imperialism is completely contrary to the will of the peace-loving people and Christians in the United States. We call on American peace-loving mothers, fathers, and kind people to quickly rise up to protest and stop the US invading army's shameful crimes of indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities in Korea and slaughtering the old, weak, women, and children, and immediately stop the war of aggression against Korea. We hope that Christians and churches in the Asia-Pacific region and around the world will unite with peace-loving people around the world to protest and stop the US imperialists' monstrous crimes of indiscriminately bombing innocent people in Korea, and strive to stop the Korean War and save and defend peace.

    中国红十字会等发表声明
    抗议美机滥炸朝鲜和平城市
    【新华社三日讯】中国红十字会抗议美国侵略者滥炸朝鲜和平城市的声明。文如下：
    在过去两年多的时间中，侵朝美国军队曾经不断地破坏和蹂躏国际人道主义原则，非法使用毒气弹、凝固汽油弹、高度爆炸弹、细菌武器等，大规模地屠杀朝鲜和平人民，破坏朝鲜和平城乡。这些丑恶非人道的行为，在人类历史上写下了最为残酷而又最为玷辱人类尊严的一页！
    但是，美国侵朝军队，竟在举世和平正直人民一致严厉声讨的同时，扬言要从空中毁灭朝鲜北部的七十八个和平城市，更残酷地大规模屠杀和平居民，毁坏和平建设；并已屡次对平壤市居民地区和朝鲜北部的水电厂肆行轰炸。这种疯狂的破坏行为，是对人类正义和良心的直接进攻。
    我们红十字工作者，有维护人道主义原则与保卫世界和平的高尚职责。为了朝鲜千千万万的母亲和孩子，为了日内瓦公约的尊严，我们要求全世界的红十字工作者、红十字会会员以及一切和平正直的人民，一致起来，制止美国军队这种暴行。
    中国红十字会会长　李德全
    【新华社讯】中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹备委员会三十日发表声明，抗议美帝国主义滥炸朝鲜和平城市。声明中说：对于美国空中强盗轰炸七十八个朝鲜和平城市的计划及最近滥炸平壤等地的血腥罪行，我们提出严重的抗议。我们相信美帝国主义这种暴行是完全违反美国和平人民和基督徒的意旨的。我们呼吁美国爱好和平的母亲们、父亲们和善良的人民，快起来抗议并制止美国侵略军队滥炸朝鲜和平城市、屠杀朝鲜老弱妇孺的可耻罪行，并马上停止侵略朝鲜的战争。我们希望亚洲、太平洋区域和全世界的基督徒与教会，与全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，抗议并制止美帝国主义滥炸朝鲜无辜人民的滔天罪行，为停止朝鲜战争，为拯救和平，保卫和平而努力奋斗。
