    Films such as "Maternal and Infant Hygiene" and "Gods and Ghosts Are Ineffective" Have Played a Great Educational Role

    Comrade Editor: Recently, the Xiahuayuan Mining Area film crew screened films such as "Maternal and Infant Hygiene," "Ghost Stories," and "Gods and Ghosts Are Ineffective" at our factory, and we received a great education.

    Although it has been almost four years since liberation here, some people's superstitious and conservative ideas are still very strong, especially the workers living in the rural areas. Some people are sick, but they are still unwilling to see a doctor, and instead go to shamans, often ending up losing both money and lives. Some people still use the old methods of midwifery when giving birth, resulting in very unhealthy infants and a high mortality rate.

        "Maternal and Infant Hygiene" introduces scientific midwifery methods and what pregnant women and children should pay attention to. Many people said after watching it, "If we had used this method of delivery earlier, some children would not have died." A worker said, "My wife died giving birth because she didn't pay attention to hygiene." Everyone was very moved.

    The film "Gods and Ghosts Are Ineffective" depicts how an honest farmer was deceived, losing both money and lives, while the "god's" son was secretly sent to the hospital for treatment when he was sick. Finally, the government led everyone to expose this trick. Many people said after watching it, "In the past, we went to shamans when we were sick, spending money and losing our lives, it was really not worth it!"

    These films have had a much greater propaganda and educational effect in our area than holding large meetings or using written propaganda. I suggest that more of these films be produced in the future and shown in factories and rural areas.

### “妇婴卫生”“神鬼不灵”等影片发挥了很大教育作用

    “妇婴卫生”“神鬼不灵”等影片发挥了很大教育作用
    编辑同志：最近下花园矿区电影队，在我厂放映“妇婴卫生”“鬼话”“神鬼不灵”等影片，我们受到了很大教育。
    我们这里虽然解放快四年了，但有些人的迷信、保守思想依然很浓厚，尤其是住在四乡的工人。有些人生病了，还是不愿意请医生医治，而去找跳神的，往往弄得人财两空。有的人生小孩，仍然用旧法接生，结果婴儿很不健康，死亡率很高。
        “妇婴卫生”介绍了科学的接生法及孕妇小孩应注意些什么。很多人看完后都说：“要是早照这个方法接生，有些孩子也不会死了。”有个工人说：“我老婆生孩子死了，原来就是不讲卫生给害死的。”大家都很感动。
    影片“神鬼不灵”描写一个老实的农民如何受了骗，弄得人财两空，而“神”的儿子病了，却偷偷地送到医院去医治。最后政府领导大家揭穿了这个鬼把戏。很多人看完后都说：“从前有病去找跳大神的，化钱丧命，真不值！”
    这些影片在我们这里所起的宣传教育作用比开大会或用文字宣传的效果大得多。我建议以后多摄制这类片子，并深入工厂、农村去放映。
