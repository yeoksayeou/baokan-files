    On the Subei Irrigation Main Canal
    By Our Correspondent Bai Yuan
    Starting from Yangzhou, Jiangsu, going north along the Grand Canal, one enters the downstream area of the Huai River Basin. To the right is a dense countryside and beautiful farmland shaded by greenery, and to the left is an endless expanse of lakes. The middle reaches of the Huai River pass through Hongze Lake, and here they flow into Baoying Lake, Gaoyou Lake, and Shaobo Lake, pouring out rushing water. Opening the map of the Huai River Harnessing Project, one can see that a waterway for the Huai River to flow into the Yangtze River will be built through Gaoyou Lake and Shaobo Lake. When this waterway is completed in the future, the entire lake will be drained through this waterway, and the lakebed will be reclaimed into 1.5 million mu of fertile land. If it were not for facing the map of the engineering plan, if it were not for the precedents of many great projects in recent years, then people standing by the lake, looking at the vast expanse of the lake, looking at the sailboats floating like small leaves on the horizon, and hearing people describe such things, would be like listening to myths. Today, in the great construction of our motherland, how many vast waters have become plains, how many plains and mountains have been chiseled into rivers, and how many wandering people have established permanent homes!
    Leaving this area of lakes and going further, in Huai’an County, more than 250 li from Yangzhou, I arrived at the Subei Irrigation Main Canal. This is a 340-li-long river entirely dug by manpower. A total of 1.3 million people participated in this construction, and the entire canal project was completed in just about half a year. The canal starts from Gaoliangjian on the edge of Hongze Lake and runs east through the borders of Huaiyin, Huai’an, Funing, and Binhai counties, reaching the Yellow Sea at Biandang Port on the edge of the Yellow Sea. It can not only draw water from Hongze Lake to irrigate 25 million mu of farmland in the Subei Plain, and discharge the floodwater pouring into Hongze Lake from the middle reaches of the Huai River during floods, but also allow navigation. This is a beautiful river. Hundreds of miles of torrential water shine with the light of the people's labor and wisdom under the sky. On this vast land, people have developed a permanent sense of local affection for the first time.
    I strolled along the embankment of the irrigation main canal. It was early autumn. In the villages on both sides, there was a chorus of cicada chirping and turtledove cooing. In the rice fields, the rice had begun to ripen. This is the season for preparing for the autumn harvest. However, the farmers on both sides of the irrigation main canal were busy plowing. In the past, these lands were flooded every year and had not been plowed for a long time, and they were covered with patches of green grass. Since the irrigation main canal was completed in April this year, people have been plowing these lands non-stop. Chunks of black soil were turned over from the plow, glistening with oiliness. I walked down the slope of the embankment,
    and went straight to the village. This is an area southwest of Huai’an City, called Yannan District. Here, the entire district is a low-lying land. In the past, the land was flooded every year, causing people to lose hope in it. During the sowing season, people would casually turn over the ground with their hands or some sticks, and then scatter the seeds into the ground. Relying on this fertile land, crops would still grow. But just when it was almost time to harvest, a flood would submerge the already ripe crops. The land was flooded and would not recede until after autumn. Seeing that the wheat sowing season was about to pass, people would scatter the seeds into the water, with the last bit of hope, hoping that the water would recede next year and perhaps the wheat would still grow. Finally, seeing that there was no hope at all, people would abandon their homes and fields in groups and wander to distant lands. Now, when you go to these villages, you can still imagine the scene of those days: countless crisscrossing streams flowing into small rivers, covering this area of land. Across those small rivers that pass through the villages, there are single-plank bridges seven or eight feet or even more than a zhang high. Trembling as you walk across these single-plank bridges, you will remember how many people shed tears here in those long years of disaster! But those days are finally over. The broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have built permanent homes with their own hands. They have turned vast waters into plains and have dug rivers from the plains. The water flows obediently around the villages, and the chirping of cicadas and the cooing of turtledoves have also turned into sounds of joy.
    Crossing the winding small river, I went to the home of a farmer in a village. The farmer's name is Xu Shouyong, and he is the leader of a mutual aid group in the village. In Huai’an City, I heard that their mutual aid group had a very good harvest this year. I wanted to ask him to tell me about their production situation. But before I could say anything, he pulled me outside. "Take a look!" He pointed to the small mountain-like stacks of wheat straw piled on the field near the village and asked me to look. Then he led me to the bank of a small river, where there was a row of neat pigsties. Each pig occupied one room, living separately in the sties. "Look at these fat pigs, how fat they have grown!" Xu Shouyong told me that these pigs were all bought with the wages they earned last year and this year when they participated in the construction of the irrigation main canal. They were only bought a few months ago, but each one has grown so fat. On the opposite bank of the small river, a tall, jujube-red horse was standing under the shade of a tree, enjoying the coolness. This is the mutual aid group's horse. According to Xu Shouyong, there are also two large castrated oxen, which were bought in the past with agricultural loans issued by the People's Government. Before the harnessing of the Huai River after liberation, this place was still flooded every year, and every year they had to rely on the government to issue agricultural loans or use other methods for relief. But after the wheat harvest this year, they paid off all the government's agricultural loans for the past five years in one go.
    It was already noon. I talked with Xu Shouyong while returning to his home. His wife scooped a large bowl of noodles from the pot and placed it on a small table, asking me to eat. It turned out that they had already had lunch. This was specially cooked by his wife to entertain me when Xu Shouyong and I went out. I felt a little embarrassed, so I asked, "Where did you get the noodles? Why didn't you leave them for the children?" "We made them ourselves, we have plenty..." Xu Shouyong said, sitting down and telling me about his family's life this year. There are three people in his family: Xu Shouyong and his wife, and a teenage girl. This summer, the crops they harvested, converted to wheat, totaled 2,240 jin. They paid off the five-year agricultural loan of 832 jin, paid 61 and a half jin of patriotic public grain, leaving 1,346 and a half jin. Based on 60 jin per person per month for living expenses, it is enough for them to use for more than seven months.
    After eating, I prepared to leave. Xu Shouyong sent me to the outside of the village. Along the small river, he pointed for me to see their farmland. A patch of rice that had begun to ripen was chasing the approaching harvest time to grow. Xu Shouyong said that this piece of land had been abandoned in the past because it was flooded, and they only started planting crops this year. When we were about to part at the edge of the village, Xu Shouyong suddenly took my hand and walked back along the small river we had just walked along, as if he wanted to tell me something secret, and said to me: "Come and see here..." It turned out that on a section of the small river near the village, they had blocked it with soil at both ends and raised many fish fry inside. We stood on the bank, and the breeze blowing from the fields gently stirred the ripples on the water. "Aren't you afraid that the water will wash them away?" I asked. "We're not afraid anymore. Look, isn't that it?" Xu Shouyong plucked a few blades of grass and threw them into the water, letting me see a group of swimming fish fry. Those fish swimming in the water were also living a stable life for the first time, not afraid of people at all, sometimes diving into the water and sometimes floating to the surface, spitting out small bubbles on the water under the willow shade, sparkling.
    Leaving Xu Shouyong and his village, I crossed another field and walked on the embankment of the irrigation main canal. The midday sun shone on the wide surface of the irrigation main canal. A long line of sailboats was sailing along the irrigation main canal. They were carrying various building materials and equipment, preparing to build culverts for the canal, in order to start drawing water from the irrigation main canal to irrigate the fields on both sides. Near a ferry crossing, a farmer was using a long bamboo pole to punt a small boat, driving a large flock of ducks across to the opposite bank. The boatman of the approaching sailboat said something to him, and both of them laughed heartily. I seemed to hear them saying: Look at our motherland, what a beautiful motherland!

    在苏北灌溉总渠上
    本报记者  白原
    从江苏的扬州出发，沿着运河往北，走进淮河流域的下游地带。右边是一片绿荫掩映下的稠密的乡村和美丽的田园，左边是一望无际的湖水。淮河的中游经过洪泽湖，在这里又流进宝应湖、高邮湖和邵伯湖，倾泻着奔腾的流水。打开治淮工程计划的地图，人们就可以看见：在这里，将要穿过高邮湖和邵伯湖建筑一条淮河流入长江的水道。将来这条水道建成以后，整个一片湖水都将从这条水道里流干，湖底将被开辟成一百五十万亩肥田。如果不是面对着工程计划的地图，如果没有近年来许多伟大工程的先例，那么人们站在湖边，望着那一片茫茫的湖水，望着那些好像一片片小树叶一样在天边飘荡着的帆船，听人们述说这样的事情，就如同听神话一样。今天，在我们祖国的伟大建设当中，多少汪洋变成了平地，多少平地和山岳凿成了江河，多少飘流的人们建立了永久的家园！
    离开这一带湖水，再往前走，在距扬州二百五十多里的淮安县，我到了苏北灌溉总渠上。这是一条完全用人工挖成的三百四十里长的河流。参加这个建设的人前后一共有一百三十万，仅仅经过约半年的时间就完成了整个渠道工程。渠道从洪泽湖边的高良涧起，向东经过淮阴、淮安、阜宁、滨海四个县境，在黄海边的扁担港通到黄海里去。它不仅可以引洪泽湖的湖水灌溉苏北平原二千五百万亩田地，以及在洪水暴发时排泄淮河从中游拥进洪泽湖的洪水，而且还可以通航。这是一条美丽的河流。几百里滔滔的流水，在天空下闪耀着人民的劳动和智慧的光辉。在这一片宽广的土地上，人们第一次产生了永久的乡土的感情。
    我沿着灌溉总渠的堤岸漫步走着。这时正是初秋。在两岸的乡村里，响着一片蝉的鸣声和班鸠的啼声。稻田里，稻子都开始黄熟了。这是准备秋收的季节。可是灌溉总渠两岸的农民，这时却在匆忙地犁耕着。过去，这些土地因为年年被洪水淹没，长久地没有犁耕过，上面长满了一片一片的青草。自从今年四月里灌溉总渠修好以后，人们就开始不停地犁耕着这些土地。一块块黑色的泥土从犁头上翻过来，湿腻腻地闪着油光。我走下堤岸的斜坡，
    一直往村子里走去。这是淮安城西南边的一个区，叫盐南区。在这里，整个区都是一片低洼的土地。过去，土地年年被洪水淹没，使得人们对它失掉了希望。在播种的季节，人们用手或者什么棍棒随便在地上翻翻，就将种籽撒到地里去。凭着这一片肥美的土地，就这样庄稼也长了出来。可是眼看快要收割的时候，一场洪水又把已经成熟的庄稼都淹没了。土地被水淹着，一直到秋后也不退。人们看着种麦的季节快要过去，就把种籽撒到水里去，怀着最后的一点希望，希望来年水退了，也许麦子还会长起来。最后看着一点点希望也没有了，人们就一群群地抛弃了自己的家乡和田地，到遥远的异乡去四处流浪。现在，当你走到这些乡村里去，还可以想见当日的景象：无数纵横交错的流水，流成了一道道小河，布满在这一带的土地上。在那些穿过乡村的小河上，架着七、八尺甚至一丈多高的独木桥。战兢兢地从这些独木桥上走过去，你就会想起来，在那些长久的灾难的年月里，不知有多少人在这里流过眼泪！可是那些日子终于过去了。广大的人民在共产党的领导下，用自己的双手建立了永久的家园。他们把汪洋变成了平地，又从平地上开凿了河流。流水驯顺地围绕着乡村静静流着，蝉的鸣声和班鸠的啼唱也变成了欢乐的声音。
    跨过弯弯曲曲的小河，我在一个村子里走到一个农民的家里去。这个农民的名字叫许寿永，是村里一个互助组的小组长。在淮安城里，我就听说今年他们互助组的生产很好。我想请他把他们生产的情况告诉我。可是话还没有说下去，他就拉着我往外面走。“你看看！”他指着村边场里堆着的那些小山一样的麦秆垛叫我看。接着他又引着我走到一条小河的岸边，那是一排整洁的猪圈。每一条猪占着一间，在圈里分居着。“你看这肥猪，长得多肥了呵！”许寿永告诉我，这些猪，都是他们在去年和今年参加建设灌溉总渠的时候，用所得的工资买来的。才买了几个月，可是一只只都长得这么肥了。在小河对岸，一匹高大的枣红马正在树荫下站着乘凉。这是互助组的马。据许寿永说，此外还有两头大犍牛，都是过去用人民政府发的农贷买的。在解放以后，没有治理淮河以前，这个地方还是年年被水淹，每年都得靠政府发农贷或用其他办法来救济。可是今年麦收以后，他们把政府过去所发的五年的农贷一下子都通通还了。
    这时已经是中午。我和许寿永一边谈着，一边回到他的家里去。他的妻子从锅里捞出一大碗挂面端到小棹子上叫我吃。原来他们都已经吃过中饭了。这是我和许寿永出去的时候，他的妻子特地煮来招待我的。我觉得有点不好意思，就问：“那里来的挂面？怎么不留给孩子？”“自己做的，有的是，……”许寿永一边说着，一边坐下来向我述说他们一家人今年的生活。他们一家三口人：许寿永夫妇和一个十几岁的女孩子。今年夏季他们所收的庄稼，折合麦子一共二千二百四十斤，还了五年的农贷八百三十二斤，交爱国公粮六十一斤半，剩下一千三百四十六斤半。以每人每月的生活用六十斤计算，也够他们用七个多月。
    吃过了饭，我准备走了。许寿永送我走到村外。沿着小河，他指点着我看他们的庄稼地。一片已经开始成熟的稻子正追赶着那临近收割的时间成长着。许寿永说，这一片地，过去因为遭水淹，都是被人抛弃了的，今年才开始种起庄稼来。在村边上正要分手的时候，许寿永又突然拉着我的手顺着刚才走过的小河往回走，好像要告诉我什么秘密的事情一样，对我说：“你来看看这里，……”原来在村边的一段小河上，他们在两头用土堵起来，在里面养了许多鱼秧子。我们站在岸边上，从田野上吹来的微风轻轻吹动着水上的波纹。“真不怕水来冲走了？”我问。“不怕了。你看，那不是？”许寿永拔了几根草叶丢到水上，让我看一群游过的鱼秧子。那些在水里飘游的鱼，也是第一次在过着安定的生活，毫不怕人地一时潜到水里去，一时又浮到水面来，在柳荫下的水面上吐着一个个小小的水泡，闪闪发光。
    离开了许寿永和他的村子，我又越过一片田野，走在灌溉总渠的堤岸上。中午的阳光照着灌溉总渠的宽阔的水面。一列长长的帆船沿着灌溉总渠在航行。它们载着各种建筑工程的器材，正在准备着建筑渠道的涵洞，以便开始从灌溉总渠里引水来灌溉两岸的田地。靠近一个渡口的旁边，一个农民用一根长长的竹竿撑着一只小船，正在水上赶着一大群鸭子渡过对岸去。驾过来的帆船的船夫不知对他说了一句什么，两个人都哈哈地笑起来。我好像听见他们是在说着：看我们的祖国呵，多么美丽的祖国！（附图片）
