Celebrating National Day and Further Strengthening Various Construction Works in North China

Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council

Along with the great victories on all fronts of the motherland in the past three years, the people of North China, under the direct leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, have also victoriously carried out great revolutionary movements such as land reform, resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. They have also rapidly carried out various construction works and achieved significant accomplishments in all aspects. Now, the people of the entire region are filled with confidence as they welcome the upcoming tasks of large-scale economic construction, cultural construction, and national industrialization, and are working hard to make all necessary preparations for this.

The industrial and agricultural production of North China, after three years of efforts, has generally recovered and has seen new development. Cities and villages have begun new construction work, and we have victoriously completed the historical transformation of cities leading the countryside. Various industries in North China, including steel, iron, coal, electricity, machinery, cement, and textiles, have not only recovered but in some cases exceeded their historical peak levels in the past three years. Currently, they are undergoing comprehensive recovery and focused construction. In agriculture, the total grain output of North China in 1949 was only about 78% of the total output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. This year's planned output has exceeded the total output before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 3%. The cotton output in 1949 was only about 66% of the output before the War of Resistance Against Japan, while this year's planned output exceeds the highest output before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 70%. Based on this year's bumper harvest, the actual yields of both grain and cotton will exceed the planned output. Public and private commerce and cooperatives, serving industrial and agricultural production and the new urban-rural and domestic-foreign relations, have also greatly developed in the past three years. In terms of turnover, the total of state-owned commerce, private commerce, and cooperative commerce in 1950 was about 198% of that in 1949, and in 1951 it was about 226% of that in 1950. The foreign trade volume of North China in 1951 was 224% of that in 1949. The development of cooperatives is rapid, with more than 25 million members, and it has become an important factor in promoting economic prosperity, invigorating the market, and a powerful link connecting industrial and agricultural production. Our financial work has also been strengthened year by year, with national revenue increasing year by year, while the burden on the people has been relatively reduced. This year, the agricultural tax per mu in North China has been reduced by 12% compared to last year, which has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers.

The achievements of the above economic work are due to our correct implementation of the various policies and instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and the resolute reliance on the working class and the unity of all the people in a common struggle. These achievements will be further consolidated and developed through the increase production and practice economy campaign launched simultaneously on the industrial, agricultural, and trade fronts this year. In industry, over the past three years, we have relied on the vast number of workers to carry out a series of major reforms, gradually transforming old enterprises into new enterprises. This transformation process is expected to be basically completed through this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, through the promotion of advanced experiences, conducting verifications, revising new quotas, establishing cost accounting, and implementing planned management, thereby laying a reliable foundation for the comprehensive implementation of the economic accounting system. In agriculture, the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation displayed by the peasant masses on the basis of land reform and the great production movements of previous years has been rising year by year. At present, there are 2 million mutual aid teams of various types in the region, with the organized labor force accounting for 65% of the total agricultural labor force, of which year-round mutual aid teams account for more than one-third (about one-fifth last year). There are now more than 1,700 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 21,000 peasant households participating, opening up a new path for agricultural collectivization. Agricultural production campaigns are closely combined with political tasks; mutual aid and cooperation are closely combined with the improvement of technology and supply and marketing work; water conservancy has been greatly developed. In 1952, the large-scale water conservancy projects of diverting the Yellow River to benefit Wei River and the Huangyang Sluice have been completed, and the construction of the Guanting Reservoir has begun; unrelenting struggles against various serious natural disasters; coupled with strong national assistance, have resulted in continuous improvement in agricultural productivity, new records in the unit area yield of cultivated land, and the increasing organization and planning of agricultural production. The unprecedented scale of this year's agricultural patriotic production increase movement fully demonstrates the new heroism of the vast number of farmers and the unlimited potential of agricultural production. On the basis of production recovery and development, people's lives have been greatly improved, and social purchasing power has increased accordingly. For example, the direct wages of employees of state-owned enterprises in Tianjin have increased by 40% to 81% in the past three years. If labor protection, various welfare benefits, and bonuses are added, the actual income of employees is far greater than this. According to a typical survey of 1,850 farm households in Hebei Province, if the average purchasing power of each farmer in 1950 is taken as 100, it increased by 52% in 1951 compared to 1950, and by another 12% in 1952 compared to 1951. The market for industrial products is expanding more and more widely.

"With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Due to the rapid recovery and development of production in the past three years, the development of people's cultural and educational undertakings and health undertakings has also been significant. The number of various secondary schools in North China has increased from 511 in 1950 to 706 in 1952, while the number of students during the same period has increased from more than 150,000 to more than 370,000. The number of primary schools has increased from more than 73,000 in 1950 to more than 86,900 in 1952, while the number of students during the same period has increased from 5 million to more than 8.12 million. Last year, more than 400,000 workers and staff members in the region participated in spare-time cultural studies, and more than 3.7 million farmers participated in year-round people's school studies. This year, after the promotion of Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method, the situation has developed even more rapidly. Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method provides the possibility for the region to basically eliminate illiteracy within four or five years. According to preliminary plans in various places, 5 million people in the region will be made literate in 1952. Promoting Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method and launching an illiteracy elimination campaign is an urgent and major political task. We will lead this historically significant movement with the spirit of leading previous political movements in order to rapidly promote national construction. According to preliminary experience in various places, in the work of eliminating illiteracy, we must take into account both crash literacy and consolidation of achievements, aiming for both speed and consolidation, emphasizing both quantity and quality, and avoiding the creation of half-baked results. The study of Marxism-Leninism and the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has created a craze in the region. This year, 150,000 cadres in the region participated in organized theoretical studies, an increase of 50,000 compared to last year. Tianjin is an industrial and commercial city with a population of 2 million. Now, more than 700,000 people in the city are participating in various studies, including 300,000 workers participating in spare-time cultural studies and rapid literacy classes, and others are citizens, students, and cadres. Our city has not only been transformed into a truly productive city, but also its flourishing culture is unprecedented in history. In the past three years, our health undertakings have also developed greatly, mass diseases have been greatly reduced, and the patriotic health movement launched to thoroughly smash the bacteriological warfare of U.S. imperialism has achieved great results and greatly improved the people's health. The masses' demands for cultural life and cultural and scientific knowledge are becoming more and more urgent. Although our expenditures on social, cultural, educational, and health affairs have generally reached more than 30% in recent years, they still cannot meet the needs of the country and the vast masses. Therefore, we still have much work to do in this regard.

"Our state system of people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon for guaranteeing the victory of the people's revolution and opposing the restoration plots of enemies at home and abroad. We must firmly grasp this weapon." In the past three years, we have also achieved important achievements in the construction of political power. North China has five provinces, two municipalities, twelve province-level municipalities, and three hundred and twenty-eight counties. Since 1949, people's representative conferences of all circles have been generally established and convened multiple times, and this type of conference has long formed a system. The People's Representative Conferences of various provinces and municipalities have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, and elected the People's Government Committees of the provinces and municipalities and the chairmen and vice-chairmen or mayors and vice-mayors. Since the North China First County Head Conference issued a decision last year to strengthen the work of the county People's Representative Conferences, 110 counties have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected county heads, deputy county heads, and county People's Government Committees. The other 200-plus counties (banners) will exercise the functions and powers of the county People's Congress in the coming winter and spring in conjunction with central tasks. Ethnic autonomous regions have been established in areas inhabited by various ethnic minorities, and various construction works are being actively carried out. The People's Representative Conferences at all levels have been tested by successive revolutionary movements, fully proving that it is the best organizational form for the people to exercise state power. Representatives from all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and other patriotic democratic elements participate in the People's Representative Conferences and People's Government Committees at all levels, fully embodying that our state power is a people's democratic united front regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The democratic foundation of the People's Representative Conference is expanding year by year, and the people have been able to further cherish their democratic rights and seriously elect their representatives. According to statistics from a meeting convened this spring in Changzhi and other 38 counties in Shanxi Province, the proportion of representatives directly or indirectly elected by the masses has increased from about 80% in the same period last year to more than 95%, with only slightly more than 4% of the representatives being invited through consultation. The achievements of the People's Representative Conference mark the achievements of democratization in our country, and national democratization is a necessary condition and powerful guarantee for national industrialization. This has been fully proven by the work of the People's Representative Conference in the past three years.

The people and all cadres of North China, under the kind teachings and leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for a long time, learned warfare and won the war in the war years, learned to eliminate feudal forces and achieved complete victory during the land reform period, and when domestic peace has been won and construction has begun, we have begun to learn various construction works and have achieved initial achievements, making due contributions to the cause of peace. When the glorious and great tasks of the new large-scale economic construction and cultural construction come, as long as we continue to study Marxism-Leninism, faithfully implement the various policies and instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, fully mobilize the masses and trust the creativity of the masses, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and prevent and correct the shortcomings and errors in our work at any time, we firmly believe that, as in any period in the past, the people of North China will certainly be able to gloriously complete their historical tasks under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government.

    祝贺国庆，进一步加强华北区各项建设工作
    中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会主任  刘澜涛
    随同祖国三年来各个战线上的伟大胜利，华北区人民在伟大的毛主席和中央人民政府的直接领导下，同样胜利地进行了土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命和“三反”“五反”等伟大革命运动，同样迅速地进行了各项建设工作，并在各方面获得了重大成就。现在全区人民正满怀信心地迎接即将到来的大规模经济建设、文化建设和国家工业化的任务，并为此而努力进行着一切必要的准备工作。
    华北区的工业和农业生产，经过三年来的努力，一般已经恢复并有了新的发展，城市和乡村都已开始进行了新的建设工作，我们业已胜利地完成了城市领导乡村的历史转变。华北区各种工业，包括钢、铁、煤、电、机械、水泥及纺织业在内，三年来不但已经恢复到而且部分地超过了历史上的最高水平，目前正在进行全面恢复和重点建设。在农业方面，华北区粮食总产量在一九四九年仅达抗日战争前总产量的百分之七十八左右，今年的计划产量则已超过抗日战争前总产量的百分之三；棉花产量在一九四九年仅达抗日战争前产量的百分之六十六左右，今年计划产量则超过抗日战争前最高产量的百分之七十。根据今年的丰收情况，上述粮食和棉花的实际收获量均将超过计划产量。为工农业生产和新的城乡、内外关系服务的公私商业和合作社，三年来也有很大发展。从营业额上看，国营商业、私营商业和合作社商业合计，一九五零年约为一九四九年的百分之一九八，一九五一年又约为一九五○年的百分之二二六。华北区的对外贸易额，一九五一年则为一九四九年的百分之二二四。合作社的发展是迅速的，现有社员二千五百多万人，已成为繁荣经济、活跃市场的重要因素和联结工农业生产的有力纽带。我们的财政工作也一年比一年加强，国家收入逐年增加，而人民负担则相对减轻，华北今年的农业税每负担亩较去年减少百分之十二，这就进一步鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性。
    以上经济工作的成就，是由于我们正确地执行了毛主席和中央人民政府的各项政策与指示，坚决地依靠工人阶级和团结全体人民共同奋斗的结果。这些成就经过今年在工业、农业和贸易三条战线上同时开展起来的增产节约竞赛运动，将获得进一步的巩固和发展。在工业方面，三年来我们依靠广大职工进行了一系列的重大改革，将旧企业逐步改造为新企业，这个改造过程，预期经过今年的增产节约竞赛运动，经过推广先进经验，进行查定，修订新的定额，建立成本核算，实行计划管理等步骤，可以基本结束，从而为全面实行经济核算制打下可靠的基础。在农业方面，农民群众在土地改革和历年大生产运动的基础上所发扬起来的互助合作的积极性，一年比一年高涨。目前全区各种类型的劳动互助组已有二百万个，组织起来的劳动力占全体农民劳动力的百分之六十五，其中常年互助组约占三分之一以上（去年约五分之一）；农业生产合作社现有一千七百多个，入社农民约两万一千多户，开辟了农业合作化的新道路。农业生产竞赛和政治任务密切结合；互助合作与改进技术与供销工作密切结合；大量发展水利，一九五二年已完成了引黄济卫、黄杨闸两大水利工程，开始了官厅水库的修建；不懈地和各种严重的自然灾害作斗争；再加上国家的大力援助，这就使得农业生产率逐年不断提高，耕地的单位面积产量的新纪录不断出现，农业生产的组织性和计划性也逐年加强，今年农业爱国增产运动的空前规模，充分表现出广大农民的新英雄主义精神和农业生产的无限潜在能力。在生产恢复和发展的基础上，人民生活有了很大的改善，社会购买力随之提高。如天津市国营企业职工，三年来仅直接工资就提高了百分之四十到八十一，如加上劳动保护、各种福利和奖励金等，职工实际所得远较此为多。另据河北省对一千八百五十个农户的典型调查，如以一九五○年每个农民的购买力平均数为一百，一九五一年则较一九五○年增加百分之五十二，一九五二年较一九五一年又增加了百分之十二强。工业品的市场正在日益广阔地扩展着。
    “随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”三年来由于生产的迅速恢复和发展，人民文化教育事业和卫生事业的发展也是显著的。华北区各种中等学校已由一九五○年的五百一十一所增加到一九五二年的七百零六所，同期学生数目则由十五万余人增加到三十七万余人；小学校由一九五○年的七万三千余所增加到一九五二年的八万六千九百余所，同期学生数目则由五百万人增加到八百一十二万余人。去年，全区有四十余万职工参加业余文化学习，三百七十余万农民参加常年民校学习，今年，祁建华速成识字法被推行以后，情况更有飞跃的发展。祁建华速成识字法提供了全区在四、五年内基本上扫除文盲的可能性。根据各地初步计划，一九五二年内全区将扫除文盲五百万人。推行祁建华速成识字法，开展扫除文盲运动，这是一项迫切和重大的政治任务。我们将以领导历次政治运动的精神，来领导这一具有伟大历史意义的运动，以便迅速推进国家的建设。根据各地初步经验，在扫除文盲的工作中，必须对于突击识字和巩固成绩同时兼顾，既要速成，又要巩固，既重数量，又重质量，避免造成夹生现象。马克思列宁主义和毛泽东选集的学习在全区已造成热潮，今年全区干部参加有组织的理论学习者达十五万人，比去年增加五万人。天津是一个有二百万人口的工商业城市，现在这个城市参加各种学习的有七十多万人，包括三十万参加业余文化学习和速成识字班的工人，其他为市民、学生、干部等。我们的城市不但已改造成为名符其实的生产城市，而且，其文风之盛，也是历史上从来没有过的。三年以来，我们的卫生事业亦有很大发展，群众疾病大大减少，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战而展开的爱国卫生运动，更获得了巨大成绩，大大提高了人民的健康程度。群众对于文化生活和文化科学知识的要求越来越迫切。我们的社会、文教、卫生费用的支出近年来虽一般达到百分之三十以上，但仍不能满足国家和广大群众的需要，因此，在这方面我们还有许多工作要做。
    “我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”三年来我们在政权建设工作方面也获得了重要的成就。华北区共有五省、两市、十二个省属市、三百二十八个县，一九四九年以来，已普遍建立并多次召开了各界人民代表会议，这种会议久已形成制度。各省市人民代表会议都已代行人民代表大会职权，选举了省市人民政府委员会及正副主席或正副市长。自去年华北第一次县长会议发布加强县人民代表会议的工作的决定以来，迄今已有一百一十个县代行了人民代表大会的职权，选举县长、副县长及县人民政府委员会，其他二百余县（旗）则将在今冬明春结合中心工作全部代行县人民代表大会职权。各少数民族聚居地区，已实现了民族区域自治，并积极进行各项建设工作。各级人民代表会议经过历次革命运动的考验，充分证明它是人民行使政权的最好的组织形式，各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、及其他爱国民主分子都有相当的代表参加各级人民代表会议和人民政府委员会，充分体现我们的国家政权是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线政权。人民代表会议的民主基础一年比一年扩大，人民群众已经能够更进一步地珍视自己的民主权利而认真选举自己的代表。据山西省长治等三十八个县今春召开的一次会议统计，由群众直接选举或间接选举的代表，已由去年同一时期的百分之八十左右增加到百分之九十五多，只有百分之四略多的代表是经过协商邀请的。人民代表会议的成就标志着我们国家民主化的成就，而国家民主化则是国家工业化的必要条件和有力保障，这一点已为三年来人民代表会议的工作充分证明了。
    华北区的人民和全体干部，长时期在毛主席、共产党的亲切教诲和领导下，在战争年代学会了战争并且赢得了战争，在土地改革时期学会了消灭封建势力并取得了彻底胜利，在国内和平已经赢得并开始建设的时候，我们又着手学习了各项建设工作并取得了初步成就，对和平事业作了应有的贡献。当目前新的大规模经济建设和文化建设的光荣而伟大任务到来的时候，只要我们继续努力学习马克思列宁主义，忠实地执行毛主席和中央人民政府的各项政策和指示，充分发动群众并信任群众的创造力，发扬批评与自我批评的革命精神，随时防止和纠正我们工作中的缺点和错误，我们深信，和过去任何时期一样，华北人民是一定能够在伟大毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，光荣地完成它的历史任务的。
