*Pravda* Editorial

Negotiations recently took place in Moscow between Comrade J.V. Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, A.Y. Vyshinsky, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, and B.N. Kumykin, Minister of Foreign Trade of the USSR, on the one side, and the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China, led by Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government Administration Council of the People's Republic of China, and including Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council, Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, Zhang Wentian, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the USSR, and Su Yu, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, on the other side.

In the course of the negotiations, important political and economic questions concerning the relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China were discussed.

The negotiations, which proceeded in an atmosphere of friendly mutual understanding and sincerity, resulted in a number of important decisions, which have been published in the documents printed in *Pravda* on September 16.

The important and fruitful results of the negotiations once again vividly demonstrate the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship, which is permanently cemented by the historic Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950. The great significance of this treaty lies in the fact that it consolidates and develops the friendly and fraternal relations of mutual assistance between the Soviet and Chinese peoples and that it serves the cause of world peace unswervingly.

In his telegram of February 12, 1952, to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Comrade J.V. Stalin said:

	"On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, please accept, Comrade Chairman, my heartfelt congratulations and wish for the further consolidation of the alliance and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union in the interests of world peace."

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance powerfully demonstrates the brilliance of the Leninist-Stalinist principles of Soviet foreign policy and fully demonstrates the deep feelings of brotherly affection of the peoples of the Soviet Union for the great Chinese people.

Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, cabled Comrade J.V. Stalin on February 11, extending warm congratulations on behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet people, the Soviet Government, and Comrade J.V. Stalin personally on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The telegram said:

	"We thank the Soviet Government and people for the warm and generous assistance they have given to the Chinese Government and people in the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and its related agreements over the past two years. This assistance has greatly helped the recovery and development of the new China's economy and the consolidation of the country.
	"We congratulate the growing closeness of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The strong alliance between China and the Soviet Union is an invincible force and a firm guarantee against imperialist aggression and for the maintenance of peace and security in the Far East, and also a guarantee for the victory of the great cause of striving for world peace."

The agreements reached in the negotiations mark a new stage in the consolidation and development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and in the maintenance and strengthening of peace and international security.

The Sino-Soviet communiqué on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China once again proves the validity of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of February 14, 1950, and proves that the Soviet Union is unwavering in honoring all its obligations.

As is known, on the basis of the established relations of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the two countries signed an agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway in Moscow on February 14, 1950. According to this agreement, the Soviet Government will transfer to the Government of the People's Republic of China, completely and gratuitously, all rights of joint management of the Chinese Changchun Railway and all property belonging to the railway, and this shall be realized no later than the end of 1952.

The Sino-Soviet communiqué on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China points out that the Soviet Government and the Government of the People's Republic of China have already begun to implement the measures to realize this agreement and have agreed to establish a joint Sino-Soviet committee for this purpose. The Sino-Soviet joint committee shall complete the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the People's Republic of China before December 31, 1952.

The agreement between the Soviet Union and China on extending the time limit for the joint use of the Chinese naval base of Port Arthur is of great significance. This agreement clearly shows that both sides are consistently concerned and eager to strengthen and maintain peace in the Far East and the world by all means.

It should be remembered that, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China guarantee "to jointly strive to take all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of aggression and violation of peace by Japan or any other state directly or indirectly allied with Japan in acts of aggression." The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China also guarantee to jointly achieve the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan in the shortest possible period, considering this to be one of the means of preventing the recurrence of Japanese aggression. When the agreement on the transfer of Port Arthur to the Government of the People's Republic of China was concluded in February 1950, both contracting parties believed that this transfer must be premised on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, as stipulated in Article 2 of the agreement on Port Arthur.

However, neither the Soviet Union nor the People's Republic of China has yet concluded a peace treaty with Japan. A completely new situation has arisen. Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government Administration Council of the People's Republic of China, pointed out this situation in his note to A.Y. Vyshinsky, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:

	"Since Japan has refused to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty and has concluded a unilateral treaty with the United States of America and several other countries, Japan has therefore not concluded a treaty with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and does not seem willing to conclude a treaty, thus creating conditions that endanger the cause of peace and facilitate the recurrence of Japanese aggression.
	"Therefore, for the sake of safeguarding peace and in accordance with the Treaty on Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Socialist Republics, the Government of the People's Republic of China hereby proposes to the Soviet Government to agree to extend the time limit stipulated in Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Agreement on Port Arthur Naval Base regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the jointly used Chinese naval base of Port Arthur until the conclusion of a peace treaty between the People's Republic of China and Japan and between the Soviet Union and Japan."

The note of the Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government Administration Council of the People's Republic of China stated that if the Soviet Government agrees to the above proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China, this note and the reply note of the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs will become part of the Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union on the Port Arthur Naval Base of February 14, 1950, and will come into effect from the date of exchange of notes.

In line with its consistent policy of strengthening peace and security, the Soviet Government agreed to the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China. A.Y. Vyshinsky's reply note stated: "The Soviet Government hereby expresses its agreement with the above proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China and agrees that your note and this reply note shall become part of the aforementioned Agreement on the Port Arthur Naval Base of February 14, 1950, and shall come into effect from the date of exchange of notes."

The agreement on extending the time limit for the joint use of the Chinese naval base of Port Arthur is an important and valuable contribution to the consolidation of peace and security in the Far East and the world.

The Soviet people will welcome with great satisfaction the agreements reached by the Soviet Government and the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China in the negotiations. They believe that these agreements prove the further development and strengthening of the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet people and the great Chinese people!

### 伟大的苏中友谊的再一次显著的表现

    伟大的苏中友谊的再一次显著的表现
    真理报社论
    苏联部长会议主席约·维·斯大林、苏联外交部部长安·扬·维辛斯基、苏联对外贸易部部长巴·尼·库米金一方，与由中华人民共和国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来率领并包括政务院副总理陈云、政务院财政经济委员会副主任李富春、中华人民共和国驻苏联特命全权大使张闻天、副总参谋长粟裕的中华人民共和国政府代表团一方之间，最近在莫斯科举行了谈判。
    在谈判过程中，讨论了有关苏联与中华人民共和国两国关系的重要政治与经济问题。
    这个在友好的互相谅解和诚恳的气氛中进行的谈判通过了若干重要的决定，这些重要决定已在真理报九月十六日刊载的文件中发表了。
    谈判的重要而丰富的成果再一次生动地表现了由
    一九五○年二月十四日签订的历史性友好同盟互助条约所永久固定下来的牢不可破的苏中友谊。这个条约的重大意义就在于：它是巩固和发展苏联与中国人民之间的友好的、兄弟般的互助关系的、它是始终不渝地为世界和平事业服务的。
    约·维·斯大林同志在一九五二年二月十二日致中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志的贺电中说：
        “值此苏中友好同盟互助条约签订二周年之际，主席同志，请接受我衷心的祝贺并祝中华人民共和国与苏联之间为着全世界和平事业利益的同盟及合作获得更进一步的巩固。”
    苏中友好同盟互助条约十分有力地显示了苏联外交政策的列宁—斯大林原则的光辉，充分地显示了苏联各族人民对伟大的中国人民的兄弟之谊的深厚感情。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志曾于二月十一日致电约·维·斯大林同志，代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向苏联人民、苏联政府及约·维·斯大林同志本人热烈祝贺苏中条约签订两周年，电文说：
    “我们感谢两年来苏联政府和人民依照中苏友好同盟互助条约及其有关各协定的精神，给予中国政府和人民热诚的、慷慨的援助，这些援助大大帮助了新中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固。
    我们祝贺中苏两国人民伟大友谊的日臻亲密。中苏两国强大的同盟是不可战胜的力量，是反对帝国主义侵略和维护远东和平及安全的坚强保证，也是争取世界和平的伟大事业胜利的保证。”
    谈判中所获致的协议标志着在苏联和中华人民共和国之间友好与合作的巩固和发展上，在和平与国际安全的维护和加强上的新阶段。
    苏中关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告，又一次证明了一九五零年二月十四日苏中条约的效力，证明了苏联对于它所承担的一切义务是信守不渝的。
    大家知道，根据苏联和中华人民共和国之间业已建立的友好与合作关系，两国于一九五零年二月十四日在莫斯科签订了关于中国长春铁路的协定。根据这个协定，苏联政府将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及属于该路的全部财产无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府完全归其所有，而且其实现不得迟于一九五二年末。
    苏中关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告指出：目前苏联政府与中华人民共和国政府业已着手进行实现该项协定的措施并为此目的已协议成立苏中联合委员会。苏中联合委员会应于一九五二年十二月三十一日前将中国长春铁路向中华人民共和国移交完毕。
    苏联和中国关于延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的协议是具有重大意义的。这个协议清楚地说明了双方是一贯关怀并亟愿用一切办法来加强和维护远东与全世界和平的。
    应当记得，根据苏中条约，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国保证“共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。”苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国并保证在尽可能短的期间共同取得全面对日和约的缔结，认为这是防止日本侵略再起的办法之一。在一九五零年二月缔结关于把旅顺口移交与中华人民共和国政府的协定时，缔约国双方都认为这种移交必须以对日和约的缔结为前提，这是关于旅顺口协定的第二条所规定的。
    可是，苏联和中华人民共和国现在都没有与日本缔结和约。一个完全新的局势产生了，中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来在致苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部部长安·扬·维辛斯基的照会中指出了这种局势：
        “自从日本拒绝缔结全面和约并与美利坚合众国以及其他若干国家缔结片面和约后，日本因此未与中华人民共和国和苏联订立和约，看来也不愿意订立和约，这样就造成了危害和平事业的条件，而便利于日本侵略之重演。
    “因此，中华人民共和国政府，为保障和平起见，并根据中华人民共和国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的友好同盟互助条约，兹特向苏联政府提议，请同意将中苏关于旅顺口协定第二条中规定苏联军队自共同使用的中国旅顺口海军根据地撤退的期限予以延长，直至中华人民共和国与日本和苏联与日本之间的和约获致缔结时为止。”
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长的照会说，如果苏联政府同意中华人民共和国政府的上项提议，这个照会和苏联外交部长的复照即成为一九五零年二月十四日中华人民共和国与苏联关于旅顺口海军根据地协定的组成部份，并自互换照会之日起生效。
    苏联政府本着加强和平与安全的一贯政策，同意了中华人民共和国政府的提议。安·扬·维辛斯基的复照说：“苏联政府对于中华人民共和国政府上项提议，兹特表示同意，并同意您的照会以及本复照成为上述一九五零年二月十四日关于旅顺口海军根据地协定的组成部份，并自本照会互换之日起生效。”
    关于延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的协议对于远东和全世界的和平与安全的巩固是一个重要的、宝贵的贡献。
    苏联人民将以十分满意的心情欢迎苏联政府与中华人民共和国政府代表团在谈判中达成的协议，他们认为这些协议证明苏联与中华人民共和国两国人民间兄弟般的友谊有了进一步的发展和加强。
    苏联人民和伟大的中国人民之间牢不可破的友谊万岁！
