Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th. The American aggressor headquarters in Tokyo and Seoul recently slapped each other in the face, once again exposing the US's use of news blackouts to cover up the crimes of slaughtering prisoners of war.

According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the 14th, the US prisoner of war command announced that another prisoner of war was beaten to death and seven were injured in the Koje Island prisoner of war camp on the 12th. However, on the same day, the US military authorities in Seoul released a smokescreen of news blackouts. According to a Reuters Seoul dispatch on the 15th, the US military headquarters in Seoul issued an official communique on the 14th stating: "The prisoner of war camp command reported that no incidents occurred in the 48 hours prior to September 14th."

News blackouts are a common tactic used by the US. Recently, due to the exposure by Beijing Radio, they were forced to reveal a series of slaughter incidents since August 11th. However, the contradictory official communiques from the US military in Tokyo and Seoul show that the US is still continuing to use news blackouts to conceal their persecution and slaughter of prisoners of war who resolutely demand to return home. Although the US revealed on the 17th that another prisoner of war was killed in the Koje Island prisoner of war camp, it is clear that more slaughter incidents are being concealed behind their iron curtain.

### 美方利用新闻封锁掩盖屠杀战俘的罪行

    美方利用新闻封锁掩盖屠杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城十八日电】东京与汉城的美国侵略军总部最近互打耳光，又一次暴露了美方利用新闻封锁掩盖屠杀战俘的罪行。
    据路透社东京十四日电报道：美方战俘司令部宣布：十二日在巨济岛战俘营中又有战俘一名被打死，七名被打伤。但是在同一天，汉城的美军当局却放起了新闻封锁的烟幕。据路透社汉城十五日消息：汉城的美军总部在十四日发表官方公报说：“战俘营司令部报告，在九月十四日以前的四十八小时内并无事件发生。”
    新闻封锁本是美方惯用的手段。最近由于北京广播的揭发，他们才被迫透露了八月十一日以来的一系列屠杀事件。但是，东京与汉城相互矛盾的美军官方公报，说明美方仍在继续利用新闻封锁，来隐瞒他们对坚决要求回家的战俘的迫害与屠杀。虽然美方在十七日透露又有一名战俘在巨济岛战俘营中被杀害，但是显然还有更多的屠杀事件被隐蔽在他们的铁幕后面。
