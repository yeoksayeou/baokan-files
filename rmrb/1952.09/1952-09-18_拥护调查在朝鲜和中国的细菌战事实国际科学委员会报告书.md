    Endorsing the Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China
    Fu Lianzhang, Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association
    The Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China has been published for the world's people. This report once again proves beyond any doubt the accusations by the people of Korea and China that the American government conducted large-scale bacterial warfare in Korea and within our territory. The righteous and stern statements of protest by Korean Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai against the American government's conduct of bacterial warfare have once again been proven to be irrefutable before the people of the world.
    The International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China was composed of prestigious scientists from six countries. After studying all previously released documents of protest and accusation concerning bacterial warfare crimes, they came to China and Korea with the highest degree of objectivity to conduct investigations for nearly two months. They not only contacted many witnesses from different professions, visited the sites in person, and talked with Chinese and Korean experts, but also spent a lot of time in the laboratory, carefully understanding the results of the tests conducted by the Chinese and Korean experts. Therefore, the materials they have mastered have all undergone the most rigorous scientific testing. Their serious, responsible, and realistic attitude is worthy of our great admiration.
    Based on numerous facts, the scientists of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China, having reached the conclusion that the American military did use bacterial weapons in Korea and China in many different ways, immediately called on the people of the world to redouble their efforts to save the world from the scourge of war and to stop this atrocity of using scientific inventions to destroy mankind. For their righteous actions in devoting themselves to the cause of peace and safeguarding the spirit of humanity, I, on behalf of all medical workers of the Chinese Medical Association, express my warm support.
    While the American government is using scientific achievements for evil purposes, it is also attempting to evade scientific judgment by means of sophistry and denial. This is not only futile but also more shameful. Crimes cannot be concealed by lies. The Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China, with its highly scientific arguments, reduces all sophistry and denial to complete failure.
    I believe that this document of great historical significance will further arouse the indignation of all peace-loving people in the world, and will more widely trigger the conscience of scientists with a sense of justice in the world—including, of course, American scientists with a sense of justice—so that they can unite to contribute even greater strength to more effectively stop this unprecedented barbaric behavior of the American government.
    In addition, we must remind those few scientists who have defended the crimes of bacterial warfare: facts are, after all, facts, and any words that violate scientific arguments are untenable; only by treating facts, humanity, and science with a sincere attitude will one not be ridiculed by the scientific community and abandoned by the people.

    拥护调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书
    中华医学会理事长  傅连暲
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书在全世界人民面前公布了。这一报告书再一次证明了朝鲜和我国人民所控诉的美国政府在朝鲜和我国境内进行大规模细菌战事实的确凿无疑。朝鲜朴宪永外务相和我国周恩来外交部部长抗议美国政府进行细菌战的义正词严的声明已经再一次在世界人民面前证明是无可辩驳的了。
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会是由来自六个国家的富有威望的科学家们组成的。他们在研究了以前发布的所有抗议与控诉细菌战罪行的文件之后，抱着最高度的客观态度来到中国和朝鲜从事调查将近两月。他们不仅接触了很多不同职业的人证，亲到现场视察，与中朝专家们进行交谈，而且用很多时间埋头于实验室，详细了解中朝专家们检验的结果。因此，他们所掌握的材料都是经过最缜密的科学考验的。他们这种认真负责、实事求是的态度值得我们十分钦佩。
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会的科学家们根据众多的事实，获得了美国军队确以许多不同方法在朝鲜和中国使用了细菌武器这一结论之后，立即号召全世界人民加倍努力，使世界免遭战祸，并制止这种以科学的发明来毁灭人类的暴行。对于他们这种致力和平事业维护人道精神的正义行动，我谨代表中华医学会全体医务工作者表示热烈的拥护。
    美国政府一面利用科学成果为非作恶，一面却又企图用诡辩抵赖的手段逃避科学的裁判。这不仅是徒劳的而且是更加可耻的。罪恶不是谎言所能遮饰，调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书以它的高度科学性的论证使一切诡辩抵赖的手段归之于彻底的失败。
    我相信，这一具有巨大历史意义的文献将更进一步地激发起全世界爱好和平的人们的义愤，将更广泛地触发世界有正义感的科学家们的良心——美国的有正义感的科学家们当然也不在例外——使他们一致起来，为了更有效地制止美国政府这种空前的野蛮行为而贡献出更大的力量。
    此外，我们还要提醒那些曾经为细菌战罪行进行过辩护的少数科学家们注意：事实终归是事实，任何违反科学论证的言词都是站立不住的；唯有以真诚的态度对待事实，对待人类，对待科学，才不会贻笑于科学界，才不会被人民所遗弃。
