    Nanchang Rolling Stock Depot Should Value Workers' Rationalization Proposals

    Editor: The failure of certain leading cadres of the Nanchang Rolling Stock Depot of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau to value workers' rationalization proposals must be swiftly corrected. In mid-August, when I went to the Nanchang Rolling Stock Depot to understand the situation, I asked Engineer Ni, who is in charge of rationalization proposals, how many proposals had been submitted by the depot's workers from the beginning until now. Engineer Ni replied, "I don't know." I asked him how many there had been from July to the present, and he couldn't answer either. Later, he flipped through several folders and finally took out the rationalization proposals written by the workers and added them up temporarily with an abacus. He said there were a total of forty-seven, of which four had been submitted for reward and adoption, and the rest were all retained. According to him, the reasons were that the drawings were not good, the theory was empty, and the explanations were insufficient, etc. I also asked him: How are the workers informed of the responses to these rationalization proposals? He said: "Within the depot, we respond verbally, and outside the depot, we notify them by phone." Based on these circumstances, we can see the irresponsible and procrastinating attitude of certain leading cadres of the Nanchang Rolling Stock Depot in handling workers' rationalization proposals. In addition, Zhou Shibin, a car inspector at the Jiujiang Train Inspection Station of this depot, created a "flatcar loading and unloading device" for vehicle inspection and repair last September. After trial use, it saved a lot of manpower and was convenient to use, improving work efficiency. The relevant departments of the Nanchang Rolling Stock Depot did not pay attention to this proposal, and did not give Zhou Shibin a reply as to whether it was good or bad or whether it could be used, and even lost Zhou Shibin's proposal letter and the drawings he submitted. There are many similar examples. Therefore, it greatly affected the enthusiasm of workers to put forward rationalization proposals. Therefore, I suggest that the Nanchang Rolling Stock Depot quickly formulate a set of systems for handling rationalization proposals, so that there is registration, review, and response, so that workers can put forward more rationalization proposals, in order to promote the development of production.

    南昌车辆段应重视职工合理化建议
    编辑同志：南昌铁路分局南昌车辆段某些领导干部，不重视职工合理化建议的情况，必须迅速改进。八月中旬，我到南昌车辆段了解情况时，问负责管合理化建议的倪工程师，车辆段职工们从开始提合理化建议到目前止，共提过多少件？倪工程师答复说：“不知道。”问他从七月份起到现在有多少件，他也答不出。后来他把几个卷宗夹子翻了几翻，才把工人们写的合理化建议拿出来临时用算盘加，他说共有四十七件，除其中四件已报请奖励采用外，其余的全部保留。据他说，原因是没有很好绘图，理论空洞，说明不够等等。我又问他：对这些合理化建议，是怎样答复工人的呢？他说：“段内的是用口头答复，段外的则用电话通告一声。”根据这些情况，我们可以看出南昌车辆段的某些领导干部，处理工人合理化建议的不负责任的和拖拉的态度。此外，如这个段的九江列车检查所检车工周士滨，去年九月就创造了检修车辆用的“台车装卸器”，经试用后，节省人力很多，并且使用方便，提高了工作效率。南昌车辆段的有关方面，也没有重视这个建议，是好是坏、能不能用，都没有给周士滨回信，还把周士滨的建议书和所送的图样丢掉了。类似这样的例子还有很多。所以大大地影响了职工提合理化建议的积极性。因此，我建议南昌车辆段，迅速制订一套处理合理化建议的制度，做到有登记，有审查，有答复，使职工们多提合理化建议，以便推动生产向前发展。
