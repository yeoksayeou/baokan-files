Editor's Note: The following are letters from the People's Governments of Ye County and Xincheng County accepting opinions from readers of this newspaper and correcting past errors of lightly indulging counter-revolutionary criminals.

In late April, reader Wang Xianzhi wrote to reflect that the People's Court of Ye County, Henan Province, had lightly sentenced the heinous local tyrant Wang Wenqing, which caused great dissatisfaction among the local masses. After we forwarded this matter to the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for investigation, it was proven to be true. Now the Ye County People's Government has accepted the opinions of the masses and submitted a request for approval to the higher authorities, and Wang Wenqing was executed according to law on July 19.

In late June, reader Wang Wenyuan wrote to reflect that the People's Court of Xincheng County, Hebei Province, had taken an erroneous attitude of ignoring his righteous action of reporting the counter-revolutionary element Guan Fengshun. After we forwarded this matter to the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for investigation, the People's Court of Xincheng County has investigated Guan Fengshun's crimes and arrested him for legal punishment on July 26.

We believe that it is good that the above two county People's Governments and judicial organs can correct their mistakes based on the opinions of the masses. However, they should also combine this with the judicial reform movement to deeply examine the reasons for the past errors of lightly indulging counter-revolutionary criminals, so as to learn lessons and improve future work.

Reader Wang Xianzhi's Letter Reflects the Ye County Masses' Demand for the Execution of Local Tyrant Wang Wenqing

Comrade Editor: I am a revolutionary soldier and a Communist Party member. My home is in Dachang Village, Changcun Township, Third District, Ye County, Henan Province. Recently, I received a letter from my family stating that the Ye County People's Court had lightly sentenced the blood-debt-laden counter-revolutionary element Wang Wenqing, a most heinous criminal, to be placed under the supervision of the masses, which has caused dissatisfaction among the local masses. I have a responsibility to report this situation to you and ask you to assist in solving this problem and correcting this erroneous judgment of the county.

Wang Wenqing is a major local tyrant and landlord in Ye County, nicknamed "Wang Wu Lai" (Wang the Fifth Rascal). He was a bandit leader and an officer in the Japanese puppet and Chiang Kai-shek's armies. For thirty years, he has been riding on the heads of the local masses, acting lawlessly and committing all kinds of evil. According to the materials from the masses' accusations alone, he murdered seventeen people, raped seven women, and his acts of oppressing the people are too numerous to mention. The local people hate him extremely. After liberation, he mixed into the revolutionary ranks and participated in work. Last year, the County Public Security Bureau arrested him after the masses reported and accused him. The local people were all hoping that the People's Government would execute him according to law to avenge the masses.

In mid-April, I received a letter from my brother from my hometown. The letter said: "In early April, the People's Court held a public trial meeting and executed several counter-revolutionary elements. However, at the meeting, Wang Wenqing was sentenced to be released back to the village to be placed under the supervision of the masses. How can the government be so 'boundlessly lenient' to such a heinous local tyrant whom the masses hate to the bone? For a period of time after liberation, although we hated him in our hearts, no one dared to say anything. The People's Government mobilized us to accuse him, saying that they would resolutely support us, the people; only then did we dare to accuse Wang Wenqing of his crimes. But why doesn't the People's Government support us now? All the cadres and masses in the township are dissatisfied with the government's handling of this matter. The next day, the cadres of our township and more than thirty victims from the three nearby townships who had suffered under Wang Wenqing went to the District People's Government to raise their opinions, demanding that Wang Wenqing be shot. Comrade Chen Yongtang, a district cadre, said: 'This is the court's judgment and should be enforced.' He also said: 'He has committed some crimes, but the crimes are not very serious; moreover, he participated in the revolution after liberation and has made some contributions.' He wanted us to take Wang Wenqing back to the village. We all can't figure it out: how can a local tyrant who owes the blood debt of more than a dozen lives and raped seven women not be considered to have committed serious crimes? Can his opportunistic mixing into the revolutionary ranks after liberation be considered a contribution? What is the basis for the government's judgment to return him to the village for supervision? Everyone firmly opposes taking Wang Wenqing back to the village. After the district cadres contacted the county by phone, Wang Wenqing was not released for the time being. But the court has already made a judgment, and it looks like he will eventually be released."

From this letter, it can be clearly seen that the erroneous judgment of the Ye County People's Court on the local tyrant Wang Wenqing has caused great dissatisfaction among the local people. It is suggested that the higher-level leading organs quickly investigate and correct this error in order to restore the government's positive image among the masses.

Reply from the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: Local Tyrant Wang Wenqing Has Been Executed by Firing Squad

People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: Your letter of April 25 forwarding the request from the masses of Ye County to execute the local tyrant Wang Wenqing has been investigated and handled by the Xuchang Prefectural Committee, which has instructed the Ye County Committee. According to the report of the County Committee: "We have suggested to the Ye County People's Government that this issue be re-examined. On June 1, the Ye County People's Government brought the local tyrant Wang Wenqing back to the township and, over the course of six days, convened cadre representative meetings and peasant association member meetings, letting go and mobilizing the masses to launch discussions; and deeply understood the situation in all strata and listened to the opinions of the masses. On the night of June 5, a struggle meeting was held, attended by more than 800 people, including the masses and victims from three townships. Based on the facts of the crime and the opinions of the masses, the Wang criminal is indeed extremely heinous; the previous release of Wang criminal back to the village was indeed a mistake. In order to correctly implement the policy and dispel the masses' concerns about the government, the Ye County People's Government has accepted the request of the masses and submitted a request for approval to the higher authorities, and Wang Wenqing was executed by firing squad on July 19." Please convey the above situation to the reader.

Reader Wang Wenyuan's Letter Requests Legal Punishment for Special Agent Guan Fengshun

Comrade Editor: The People's Court and other organs of Xincheng County, Hebei Province, should not ignore my action of reporting counter-revolutionary elements. Now I will tell you the course of this matter, hoping you will support me.

I am Wang Wenyuan from Lijia Ying, Second District, Xincheng County, Hebei Province. My father, Wang Shaotang, was a middle peasant. On the Mid-Autumn Festival of 1938, Japanese agent Guan Fengshun, under the pretext of "clearing out guerrillas," arrested my father. Later, the enemy killed my father and many revolutionary cadres with bayonets, and their bodies were fed to Japanese wolves.

During the Japanese puppet regime, Guan Fengshun brutally harmed many revolutionary cadres and ordinary people. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, he transformed himself and became the puppet police chief of Xincheng County, still riding on the people's heads and acting like a tyrant. After liberation, Guan Fengshun organized a landlord riot in 1949, injuring many district and village cadres, destroying the village peasant association, and attempting to sabotage the land reform movement. After the Xincheng County Public Security Bureau detained him, they released him quickly for some unknown reason.

Comrade Editor: The Xincheng County People's Government released such a special agent, stained with the blood of the people and reactionary in nature, at will. This is a complete violation of the people's interests. In order to avenge my father and to eliminate harm for the people, I wrote to the Xincheng County People's Court on June 1 last year (during the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries movement) to report him. However, the Xincheng County People's Court ignored it. On July 27, I wrote to the Hebei Provincial People's Court to appeal, but still received no reply.

The People's Court is a tool for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. However, the People's Court of Xincheng County and other organs ignore the righteous actions of the people in reporting counter-revolutionary elements and condone and ignore heinous counter-revolutionary elements. This extremely bad style of work is absolutely intolerable. I hope you will assist me in resolving this issue, so that the counter-revolutionary element Guan Fengshun will be punished by the people; and I suggest that the relevant leading organs inspect the work of the People's Court and other organs of Xincheng County.

Reply from the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: Special Agent Guan Fengshun Has Been Arrested and Handled According to Law

People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: After receiving the letter from reader Wang Wenyuan that you forwarded to us, we immediately suggested that the Xincheng County People's Court investigate and handle it, and at the same time, we notified the relevant units that had handled this issue in the past to review their work. The crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Guan Fengshun have now been verified by the Xincheng County Court, and the criminal was arrested on July 26. Details will be reported separately after processing.

### 叶县、新城人民政府接受本报读者意见  纠正过去轻纵反革命罪犯的错误

    叶县、新城人民政府接受本报读者意见
    纠正过去轻纵反革命罪犯的错误
    编者按：下面发表的，是叶县、新城两县人民政府接受本报读者意见，纠正过去轻纵反革命罪犯错误的有关来信。
    四月下旬，读者王先知来信反映，河南叶县人民法院轻判罪大恶极的恶霸分子王文卿，以致引起当地群众很大不满。这件事经我们转请中共河南省委检查，证明情况属实。现叶县人民政府已接受群众意见，呈请上级批准，在七月十九日依法枪决了王文卿。
    六月下旬，读者王文远来信反映，河北新城县人民法院等对他检举反革命分子关凤顺的正义行动采取了置之不理的错误态度。经我们转请中共河北省委检查后，现新城县人民法院已调查了关凤顺的罪恶，在七月二十六日予以逮捕法办。
    我们认为：上述两县人民政府和司法机关能够根据群众意见来纠正错误，这是好的。但他们还应该结合司法改革运动，深入检查过去轻纵反革命罪犯错误发生的原因，以便吸取教训，改进今后的工作。
    读者王先知来信反映叶县群众要求处决恶霸王文卿
    编辑同志：我是一个革命军人、共产党员。我家在河南省叶县三区常村乡大常村。最近我接到家里来信，知道叶县人民法院把血债累累的反革命分子王文卿重罪轻判，交群众管制，并已引起当地群众的不满。我有责任把这个情况反映给你们，请你们协助解决这个问题，纠正该县这种错误的判决。
    王文卿是叶县的大恶霸地主，外号“王五赖”。他当过土匪头子、日伪和蒋匪的军官。三十年来，他一直骑在当地群众头上，横行不法，无恶不作。仅据群众控诉的材料，他杀害人命十七条，奸淫妇女七人，欺压人民的事情更是说不完。当地人民对他极为痛恨。解放后，他混入革命阵营，参加了工作。去年经群众检举、控诉，县公安局才把他逮捕了。当地人民都盼望着人民政府依法处决他，为群众报仇雪恨。
    四月中旬，我接到哥哥从家乡来信。信里说：“四月初，人民法院召开公审大会，处决了几个反革命分子。但是，会上却把王文卿判为释放回村，交群众管制。像这样一个罪大恶极的恶霸，群众都恨他入骨，政府为什么要这么‘宽大无边’呢？在解放后的一段时间里，我们虽然心里恨他，但嘴里谁也不敢说。人民政府动员我们控诉，说是坚决为我们人民撑腰；我们才敢控诉了王文卿的罪恶。而现在人民政府为什么又不替我们撑腰呢？全乡干部群众都不满意政府这样处理。第二天，我乡干部和附近三个乡受过王文卿害的苦主三十多人都到区人民政府去提意见，要求枪毙王文卿。区干部陈永堂同志说：‘这是法院判决的，应该执行。’又说：‘他有些罪恶，但罪恶并不大；再说解放后参加了革命，也有些功。’要我们把王文卿带回村去。我们都想不通：欠着十几条人命的血债、奸淫过七个妇女的恶霸，罪恶还算不大吗？解放后，他投机混到革命阵营算是有功吗？政府判决他回村管制到底是根据什么？大家坚决反对把王文卿带回村去。区干部和县里打电话联系后，暂时没有放回王文卿。但是法院已经判决了，看样子总是要放回来的。”
    从这封信里可以很明白地看出，叶县人民法院对恶霸王文卿的错误判决，已经引起当地人民很大的不满。建议上级领导机关迅速检查与纠正这个错误，以挽回政府在群众中的不良影响。
    王先知
    中共河南省委来信答复恶霸王文卿已执行枪决
    人民日报读者来信组：你们四月二十五日转来叶县群众要求处决恶霸王文卿的来信，业经许昌地委责成叶县县委调查处理。据该县县委报告称：“我们已向叶县人民政府建议重新处理这个问题。叶县人民政府在六月一日将恶霸王文卿带回该乡，前后以六天时间，召开了干部代表会、农会会员会，放手发动群众展开了讨论；并深入各阶层了解情况，听取群众意见。六月五日夜，曾召开了斗争大会，参加会议的有三个乡的群众与苦主共八百多人。根据犯罪的事实及群众的意见，王犯确系罪大恶极；上次释放王犯回村，确是一个错误。为了正确地贯彻政策，打消群众对政府的顾虑，叶县人民政府已接受群众要求，呈请上级批准，于七月十九日枪决了王文卿。”请你组将以上情况转告读者。

    读者王文远来信要求依法惩处特务关凤顺
    编辑同志：河北省新城县人民法院等机关不该对我检举反革命分子的行动置之不理。现在我把这件事情的经过告诉你们，希望你们支持我。
    我是河北省新城县二区李家营人。我父亲王绍棠是一个中农。一九三八年中秋节，日寇特务关凤顺以“清剿游击队”为名，把我父亲抓了去。后来，敌人把我父亲和很多革命干部一起用刺刀杀死，尸首喂了日本狼狗。
    关凤顺在日伪统治时期，残害了许多革命干部和老百姓。在国民党反动统治时期，他摇身一变，又当了新城县伪警长，仍旧骑在人民头上作威作福。解放后，关凤顺在一九四九年组织了地主暴动，打伤区、村干部多人，捣毁了村农会，企图破坏土地改革运动。新城县公安局把他扣押后，不知为什么很快又释放了。
    编辑同志：像这样一个染满人民鲜血而反动成性的特务分子，新城县人民政府竟把他随便释放了，这是完全违反人民利益的。为了替我父亲报仇，也为了替人民除害，我在去年六月一日（镇压反革命运动时）写信给新城县人民法院检举了他。但是，新城县人民法院却置之不理。七月二十七日，我又写信向河北省人民法院控诉，仍旧没有答复。
    人民法院是巩固人民民主专政的工具。但新城县人民法院等对人民检举反革命分子的正义行动却置之不理，对罪大恶极的反革命分子则纵容不管。这种极端恶劣的作风是绝对不能容忍的。希望你们协助我解决这个问题，使反革命分子关凤顺受到人民的惩处；并建议有关领导机关检查新城县人民法院等机关的工作。
    王文远
    中共河北省委来信答复特务关凤顺已逮捕法办
    人民日报读者来信组：我们接到你们转来读者王文远来信后，当即建议新城县人民法院调查处理，同时并通知过去处理这个问题的有关单位检查工作。关于反革命分子关凤顺的罪行，现业经新城县法院调查证实，并于七月二十六日将该犯逮捕。详情待处理后另告。
