    The artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the Imjin River front, like many artillery units on other fronts, are using brand-new cannons donated by the people of the motherland to heavily strike the enemy in coordination with the infantry.

    In the past, the artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteers used cannons that were small in number and poor in quality. With such inferior equipment, they coordinated with the infantry to eliminate a large number of enemies equipped with modern weapons. But now, even someone who had been to the Korean battlefield a year ago would be pleasantly surprised to see our powerful artillery. Our artillery has greatly increased, and it is equipped with new modern cannons. After the artillerymen's practical tests, these cannons have five major advantages: accurate, ruthless (powerful), fierce (fast rate of fire), stable (small vibration of the gun body), and sturdy. With such excellent cannons and excellent artillerymen, plus other factors for victory, the situation on the Korean battlefield has greatly changed.

    Last spring, after the people of the motherland launched a vigorous campaign to donate weapons, some artillery units in the Chinese People's Volunteers were soon re-equipped, and some infantry units also "changed careers," all equipped with new cannons sent by the people of the motherland. When they received these brand-new, shiny cannons, they were indescribably excited. The cannon cleaning cloths had not yet been distributed, and the gunners began to wipe them with their new towels. They lovingly stroked it and carefully watched it. How big this cannon is! When the muzzle is raised, one person stretching out their arm can't reach it. One shell is several times heavier than the shells used in the past. The gunners said in unison: Let these shells knock on the heads of the American devils, and see if they can stand it!

    On the Imjin River front, there is such a new artillery unit that has repeatedly made military exploits. Their first test of strength was during the enemy's "summer offensive" last year. Every gunner stated before firing their first shell: "We must show the power of the cannons of the people of the motherland in the first battle!" On August 3rd, about a regiment of enemy troops, under the cover of twenty tanks, advanced along three routes towards Zhonggaozhan, attempting to attack our Gaowangshan and Maliangshan positions. As soon as the twenty tanks reached the intersection of the small road in Zhonggaozhan, artillery company commander Wang Youcai gave an order, and shells rained down and exploded in the enemy tank group. The turrets on the enemy tanks were blown open, the tracks flew into the sky, the tanks that wanted to break through and escape were trapped in the rice fields, and the tank crew members who had just jumped out of the tanks were also killed next to the tanks. An enemy battalion following behind the tanks was scattered, and when they fled to Jimingli to regroup, they were discovered by our artillery observers. He said, "Let the enemy infantry also taste the cannon shells sent by our motherland!" So the shells landed in the enemy infantry group and bloomed. Half of the enemy battalion was killed or wounded. Since the beginning of this victory, this heroic artillery unit has won repeatedly in battle and has become the closest comrade-in-arms of the infantry fighters. In early October last year, this artillery unit also cooperated with some soldiers of the Seventh Company of a certain unit on Height 216.8 to block the enemy. Whenever the enemy rushed to the front of the Seventh Company's position, artillery shells would hit the enemy's follow-up troops; after disrupting the enemy's follow-up troops, the artillery would turn back to bombard the enemy who had entered the front of our army's position. During the enemy's fourteenth charge, our artillery fire drove the enemy from the hillside to the foot of the mountain, then intercepted them, forcing the enemy into the pine forest at the foot of the mountain, and then our artillery concentrated its fire destructively, scattering the enemy, killing and wounding more than 500 enemies. Due to the close and skillful cooperation of the artillery, in this battle, the troops of the Seventh Company who defended the position killed and wounded a large number of enemy troops with very few casualties. The soldiers all praised: "The artillery comrades fought really well, we should ask for credit for them!"

    In the past year, this heroic artillery unit has used new-style cannons donated by the people of the motherland to carry out hundreds of battles, killing and wounding more than 7,400 enemies, destroying and damaging 132 enemy tanks, 71 vehicles, and cooperating with the infantry to win many battles. They also destroyed 58 enemy cannons with their fierce and accurate artillery fire when engaging in artillery battles with the enemy's artillery. In this year, the unit produced 941 meritorious personnel, ten merit-winning units, and won eleven silk banners presented by the infantry, and gloriously won collective merit. The infantry fighters all praised this artillery unit as "brave artillery" and "comrades-in-arms who opened the road to victory." But every time the artillery warriors received praise from their superiors or infantry comrades-in-arms, they always said: "This is all because the people of the motherland sent us such good cannons, we should thank the people of the motherland!"

    The encouragement and strength that the new cannons donated by the people of the motherland bring to the front-line volunteers is unparalleled. Whenever an artillery unit with brand-new cannons appears on the front line for the first time, the infantry fighters who are fighting will warmly tell each other: "Good news, the new-style cannons sent by the people of the motherland are cooperating with us in the battle!" So the soldiers fight the enemy more bravely. The battalion commander of a certain battalion of volunteers on the Imjin River front wrote in his diary: "On our position, the new cannons donated by the people of the motherland are going to 'speak' to the American aggressors. Let the enemy taste the taste of our shells!" On the same day, this infantry unit launched a fierce battle with the enemy on Height 190.8 east of Maliangshan. An enemy battalion, with the cooperation of 34 tanks and 52 aircraft, launched an attack on our army's position on Height 190.8. As soon as the enemy's tanks and infantry entered the area that our artillery had test-fired, the firing order from the artillery command post was transmitted to each artillery position. In an instant, a storm of shells fell into the enemy group, immediately killing and wounding more than 300 American soldiers and destroying two tanks. The remaining enemies retreated behind the fleeing tanks. The infantry fighters saw the power of our artillery with their own eyes and fought the enemy with a hundred times more courage. In this continuous five-day and night battle, the artillery and infantry killed and wounded a total of more than 2,800 enemies.

    When the artillery fighters on the Imjin River front welcomed the arrival of National Day, they reviewed the victories and honors they had gained in the past year. They specially wrote a letter of thanks to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland, saying in the letter: "We used the cannons sent by the people of the motherland to eliminate a large number of enemies. This credit should belong to the people of the motherland."

### 祖国人民捐献的大炮在临津江前线

    祖国人民捐献的大炮在临津江前线
    新华社记者  张涛　韩庆祥
    战斗在临津江前线的中国人民志愿军的炮兵部队，像其他战线上的许多炮兵部队一样，正在使用着祖国人民捐献的崭新的大炮，配合着步兵部队沉重地打击着敌人。
    过去，志愿军的炮兵部队使用的是数量既少、质量又差的炮。他们就是以这样劣势的装备，配合着步兵大量地消灭了现代化装备的敌人。但是现在，即使一年前曾经到过朝鲜战场的人，看到我们强大的炮兵也会感到惊喜的。我们的炮兵已经大大增加了，而且装备了新式的现代化的大炮。这些大炮，经过炮手们实战的考验，发现有五大优点：准、狠（威力大）、猛（发射速度快）、稳（炮身震动小）、坚固。有了这样优良的大炮和优秀的炮兵，再加上其他胜利因素，这就使得朝鲜战场的形势大大改观了。
    去年春天，祖国人民轰轰烈烈地展开了捐献武器运动以后，不久，中国人民志愿军中的有些炮兵部队就改装了，有些步兵部队也“改行”了，他们都装备上祖国人民送来的新炮。当他们领到这些崭新的油亮的大炮时，真是说不出的兴奋，擦炮布还没有发下来，炮手们便用自己的新毛巾擦起来了。他们喜爱地抚摸着它，仔细地观看着它，这炮多么大啊！它仰起炮口，一个人伸着胳膊还够不着，一个炮弹就顶过去用的炮弹好几个重。炮手们异口同声地说：让这些炮弹敲在美国鬼子的脑袋上，看他们吃得消吃不消！
    在临津江前线上就有这样一支屡立战功的新的炮兵部队。他们初试锋刃是在去年敌人发动“夏季攻势”的时候。每一个炮手在他们发射第一颗炮弹以前都表示：“一定要在第一仗里显示出祖国人民大炮的威风来！”八月三日，约有一个团的敌军，在二十辆坦克掩护下，分三路向中高栈开进，企图进攻我高旺山、马良山阵地。二十辆坦克刚刚开到中高栈的小公路交叉口，炮兵连长王有才一声令下，炮弹便像雨点一样地射进敌人坦克群中爆炸了，敌人坦克上的炮塔被炸开了，履带飞到半天空，想夺路逃跑的坦克陷在稻田里，坦克手刚从坦克里跳出来也被炸死在坦克旁边了。跟在坦克后面的被打散了的一个营的敌人，刚逃到鸡鸣里售合，又被我们的炮兵观察员发现了，他说：“叫敌人步兵也尝尝咱祖国人民送来的大炮弹！”于是炮弹又落在敌人步兵群中开了花。一个营的敌人被打死打伤了一半。自从这一胜仗开始以后，这支英勇的炮兵部队屡战屡胜，成了步兵战士们最亲密的战友。去年十月初，这支炮兵部队又配合二一六点八高地上的某部七连的一部分战士阻击敌人。每当敌人冲到七连阵地前沿的时候，大炮弹便向敌人的后续部队打去；打乱敌人的后续部队以后，大炮又转回来轰击进到我军阵地前沿的敌人。在敌人进行第十四次冲锋时，我们的大炮炮火把敌人从山腰赶到山脚下，又拦头截住，把敌人逼进山下的松树林里，然后我们的大炮以毁灭性地集中轰击，把敌人打得七零八落，敌人死伤五百多人。由于炮兵的紧密、巧妙的配合，在这次战斗中，七连守阵地的部队以极少的伤亡大量地杀伤了敌军。战士都交口称赞说：“炮兵同志们打得真好，应该替他们请功！”
    一年来，这支英勇的炮兵部队使用着祖国人民捐献的新式大炮，进行了数百次战斗，毙伤敌人达七千四百多人，击毁击伤敌人的坦克一百三十二辆，汽车七十一辆，配合步兵取得了许多次战斗的胜利。他们并在和敌人的炮队进行炮战时，用自己猛烈而准确的炮火打毁了敌人五十八门大炮。在这一年中，该部出现了九百四十一位功臣，十个立功单位，荣膺步兵赠给他们的十一面锦旗，并光荣地立了集体功。步兵战士们都夸赞这支炮兵部队是“神勇的炮兵”，“打开胜利道路的战友”。但是炮兵勇士们在每次得到上级或步兵战友们的赞扬时，他们总是说：“这都是因为祖国人民给我们送来了这样好的大炮，我们应该感谢祖国人民！”
    祖国人民捐献的新式大炮带给前线志愿军的鼓舞和力量，是无法比拟的。每当一支炮兵部队带着崭新的大炮首次在前线出现时，正在作战的步兵战士们便互相热烈地传告说：“好消息，祖国人民送来的新式大炮配合咱们作战啦！”于是战士们就更加勇猛地打击敌人。临津江前线志愿军某营营长在日记上写道：“在我们的阵地上，祖国人民捐献的新炮要向美国侵略军‘说话’了。让敌人尝尝我们的炮弹的滋味吧！”就在当天，这支步兵在马良山以东一九零点八高地上和敌人展开了激烈的争夺战。美军一个营的兵力在三十四辆坦克和五十二架飞机的配合下向一九零点八高地我军阵地发起了攻击。敌人的坦克和步兵刚进入我军炮兵试射好的区域，炮兵指挥所的射击命令便传到了各个炮兵阵地。倾刻间，急风骤雨般的炮弹落入敌群，当即杀伤了三百多个美国兵，打毁了两辆坦克，其余的敌人跟在逃跑的坦克后面溃退了。步兵战士亲眼看到我军炮火的威力，更加勇气百倍地打击敌人。在这次连续五昼夜的战斗中，炮兵和步兵一共杀伤了两千八百多个敌人。
    临津江前线的炮兵战士们在迎接国庆节到来的时候，他们回顾了一年来得到的胜利和荣誉，他们特地写了一封感谢信给毛主席和祖国人民，信上说：“我们用祖国人民送来的大炮，消灭了大量敌人，这功劳应该属于祖国人民。”
