The "Exhibition of the People's Republic of Hungary" displays various agricultural machines, industrial machines, long-distance passenger cars, trucks, as well as models of seagoing ships and trains. These exhibits, combined with many photos showing the recovery and development of industry and agriculture, mark the great achievements of the Hungarian people in economic and cultural construction in the seven years since liberation, and also demonstrate the scene of the People's Republic of Hungary advancing on the road to socialism under the leadership of Comrade Rakosi.

Before World War II, Hungary was still a backward agricultural country. Most of the industry was in the hands of capitalists from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and other countries, and heavy industry was pitifully small. Most of the land was in the hands of feudal landlords. The working people suffered cruel exploitation and oppression. The exhibition has a set of photos illustrating the hunger and poverty of the working people at that time: like the vast working people in our country before liberation, some people lived in crooked wooden houses and dark stone caves, while others slept in the streets. During World War II, due to the barbaric plunder of German fascists, Hungary lost 42 percent of its wealth and one-third of its industry. From several photos, we can easily see that what the German fascists left to the Hungarian people were destroyed railways and bridges, factories with crooked chimneys, and ruined rural areas and cities... everywhere were ruins and hunger.

The Soviet Red Army defeated the German fascist bandits and liberated Hungary. The Hungarian Communist Party (the predecessor of the Working People's Party) led the people to build a free country amidst ruins and hunger. In 1945, a land reform was implemented, freeing millions of farmers from the exploitation of landlords forever. In 1946, the nationalization of industry began, making workers truly the masters of enterprises; in August of the same year, a currency reform was implemented, stabilizing finance. These series of measures, coupled with Soviet assistance, enabled the Hungarian people to begin implementing the Three-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the national economy on August 1, 1947. The purpose of this three-year plan was to restore industrial and agricultural production to pre-war levels. However, with the enthusiastic help of the Soviet people, the Hungarian people overfulfilled the plan in just two years and five months. By the end of 1949, the total value of industrial production had exceeded the pre-war level by 53 percent, national income had exceeded the 1938 level by 24 percent, and the proportion of industry in national income had increased from 32.8 percent in 1938 to 49.2 percent. The photos in the exhibition about the results of the Three-Year Plan vividly illustrate the great changes in the Hungarian state: farmers are happily working on their own land, and bountiful wheat is growing in the wheat fields; railway transportation has been restored, and factories have also been restored. The government has built new dormitories for workers, and the living conditions of the working people have been improved.

From 1950, Hungary began to implement the Five-Year Plan. This five-year plan stipulates that Hungary will be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrialized country. By the end of 1954, industrial production will be doubled compared with the end of 1949, with heavy industry increasing by 2.8 to 2.9 times, and light industry increasing by 1.5 times; agricultural production will also be greatly changed, it will be equipped with 26,000 tractors, and the total value of production will increase by more than 50 percent compared with the end of 1949; the people's living standards will be raised by at least one and a half times.

All the industrial and agricultural machinery and models in the exhibition, as well as most of the photos, vividly illustrate the brilliant achievements of the Hungarian people in implementing the Five-Year Plan for the past two years. In 1950, the total industrial output increased by 35.1 percent compared with 1949, of which heavy industry increased by 36.2 percent and light industry increased by 34 percent. In 1951, the total industrial output increased by another 30.1 percent compared with 1950. In the past two years, thanks to the creative labor of the working class and the help of the Soviet Union, various industries have made rapid progress. In the coal mine sector, from excavation and mining to transportation, modern Soviet machines have been used to replace the previous manual production. Railways and transportation are also developing on a large scale. Several new railways have been built. In Budapest, an underground railway is currently being built according to the Five-Year Plan. This railway crosses the bottom of the Danube River and runs across the capital. Due to the development of transportation, many new means of transportation that could not be manufactured before have also been manufactured. The rapid advancement of the machine tool manufacturing industry is one of the most important achievements of the Hungarian people. Before liberation, this industry was the weakest. However, in the first year of the Five-Year Plan, two newly built modern machine tool factories have begun production.

However, what most prominently demonstrates the achievements of Hungarian industry is the construction of Stalin City, a socialist industrial city on the banks of the Danube River. In the exhibition, we can see photos of the prototype of this city. Building this city is a major event in the lives of the Hungarian people. The Stalin City Integrated Iron and Steel Plant is the largest construction in Hungary's Five-Year Plan. The investment in this plant is about one-tenth of the total industrial investment of the Five-Year Plan. Stalin City will have a series of factories from smelting ore to manufacturing rolled metal, a large "November 7th Power Plant," a chemical plant, a brick factory, a wide modern inland ice-free port, and a 90-kilometer-long railway, as well as an elevated railway to shorten the transportation line from the port to the factory. The integrated iron and steel plant smelted its first furnace of iron last October Revolution Day, and when it is fully operational, it will double Hungary's production of milled iron, steel, and rolled metal. The "November 7th Power Plant" also began supplying electricity to Hungarian industrial production on last October Revolution Day.

Due to the rapid development of industry, new mechanized production tools such as combine harvesters, tractors, and seeders have been working in the fields of Hungary. Large-scale mechanization and the adoption of new Soviet production methods have enabled agriculture to develop rapidly. This development points out a correct path for farmers after the land reform - the path of collective farming. Individual farmers are increasingly aware of the benefits of collective farming, and more and more people are joining production cooperatives every year. In 1950, the cultivated area of ​​state-owned farms and production cooperatives accounted for only 13 percent of the total arable area, while in 1951 it increased to 25 percent.

Due to the development of industry and agriculture, the living standards of the working people have been greatly improved. Unemployment has been eliminated forever. In 1950, the number of workers increased by 220,000. The wage fund for workers in the machine manufacturing industry increased by 37 percent in one year. In 1950, laboring farmers saved an average of 756 Hungarian currency units per household in addition to their necessary expenses.

The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to Hungary is an important factor in Hungary's great achievements in industry and agriculture in just seven years. The photos in the exhibition show that the Soviet Red Army not only liberated the Hungarian people, but also helped them rebuild their homes destroyed by the Germans. In the early days of liberation, hunger enveloped Hungary, and the Soviet people transported grain to Budapest by car. During the implementation of the Three-Year Restoration Plan and the Five-Year Construction Plan, U.S. imperialism tried its best to use counter-revolutionary remnants to sabotage, while the Soviet people provided strong assistance in terms of technology, manpower, and equipment. In the great project of building Stalin City, many modern machines such as tractors, excavators, measuring instruments, and cranes working on the construction site were supplied by the Soviet Union. The earth excavated on the site using Soviet machines alone is equivalent to more than two-thirds of the total amount of earth excavated during the excavation of the Panama Canal. In terms of technology, Soviet experts also provided great assistance. Famous Soviet Stakhanovite workers, high-speed bricklayer Maksimenko, and Ural's famous welder Amosov all went to the construction site in person to introduce advanced Soviet experience to Hungarian brothers, enabling them to improve their operating methods, improve their work efficiency, and thus accelerate the speed of construction. The Hungarian people are forever grateful for Soviet help. Comrade Heidny, a Hungarian expert working at the exhibition, said: "Only with the help of the Soviet Union can we embark on the road to socialism."

The Hungarian people call the Five-Year Plan the "Peaceful Construction Plan." Their great achievements on this front will undoubtedly inspire our workers and farmers and strengthen our confidence in the victory of construction. (Attached pictures)

    匈牙利人民向着社会主义道路迈进    
    ——从“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”看匈牙利工农业的新成就
    超祺
    在“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”会场，展览着各种农业机械、工业机械、长途客运汽车、载重汽车以及海船和火车的模型，这些实物，配合着很多表明工业农业恢复和发展的照片，标志着匈牙利人民在解放后七年多时间内经济文化建设方面的伟大成就，也展示了匈牙利人民共和国在拉科西同志领导下走向社会主义途程中的景象。
    第二次世界大战以前，匈牙利还是一个落后的农业国家。大部分工业掌握在美、英、法、德等国资本家手里，重工业少得可怜。绝大部分土地掌握在封建地主手里。劳动人民受着残酷的剥削和压迫。展览会里有一组照片是说明当时劳动人民的饥饿和贫困的：像解放前我国广大的劳动人民一样，一些人住在歪斜的木屋和阴暗的石洞里，一些人则露宿街头。在第二次世界大战期间，由于德国法西斯野蛮的掠夺，匈牙利财富损失达百分之四十二，工业损失达三分之一。我们从几幅照片里很容易看出来，德国法西斯给匈牙利人民留下来的，是破坏了的铁路和桥梁，烟囱歪倒了的工厂，毁坏了的农村和城市……到处是废墟和饥饿。
    苏联红军击溃了德国法西斯匪帮，解放了匈牙利。匈牙利共产党（即劳动人民党的前身）领导人民在废墟和饥饿中建设自由的国家。一九四五年实行土地改革，使几百万农民永远摆脱了地主的剥削。一九四六年，开始实行工业国有化，使工人真正成为企业的主人；同年八月，实行货币改革，稳定了财政和金融。这一系列的措施，加上苏联的援助，使匈牙利人民能够在一九四七年八月一日开始实行恢复与发展国民经济的三年计划。这个三年计划的目的，在于把工、农业生产恢复到战前的水平。但匈牙利人民在苏联人民热情的帮助下，仅仅用了两年零五个月的时间便超额完成了计划。到一九四九年年底，工业生产总值已超过了战前水平的百分之五十三，国民收入超过一九三八年水平的百分之二十四，工业在国民收入中所占的比重，由一九三八年的百分之三十二点八增加到百分之四十九点二。展览会里关于三年计划执行结果的照片，生动地说明了匈牙利国家的巨大变化：农民在自己的土地上喜悦地劳动着，麦田里生长着丰硕的麦子；铁路交通恢复了，工厂也恢复了。政府为工人建筑了新的宿舍，劳动人民得到了生活的改善。
    从一九五○年起，匈牙利开始执行五年计划。这个五年计划规定把匈牙利由一个落后的农业国转变为一个工业化的国家。到一九五四年末，工业生产将比一九四九年末增加二倍，其中重工业将增加二点八至二点九倍，轻工业将增加一点五倍；农业生产也将大大改变，它将获得二万六千辆拖拉机的装备，生产总值将比一九四九年末增加百分之五十以上；人民生活水平至少要提高一倍半。
    展览会里所有的工、农业机械和模型，以及大部分的照片，活生生地说明了匈牙利人民两年来执行五年计划的辉煌成就。一九五○年工业总产量比一九四九年增加百分之三十五点一，其中重工业增加百分之三十六点二，轻工业增加百分之三十四。一九五一年工业总产量又比一九五○年增加了百分之三十点一。两年多来，由于工人阶级的创造性的劳动和苏联的帮助，各种工业都突飞猛进。在煤矿方面，从掘进、回采到搬运，都采用了苏联的现代化机器以代替过去的人工生产。铁路和交通也在大规模地发展着。几条新的铁路已经建筑起来。在布达佩斯，目前正按照五年计划，建筑一条地下铁道，这条铁道穿过多瑙河河底横贯首都。由于交通的发展，许多从前不能制造的新的交通工具也随着制造出来了。工作母机制造工业的突飞猛进，是匈牙利人民最重要的成就之一。解放前，这项工业是最薄弱的。但在五年计划的第一年，两个新建设的现代化工作母机厂已经开始生产了。
    然而，最突出地表现匈牙利工业的成就的，还是多瑙河畔的斯大林城——社会主义工业城市的建设。在展览会里，我们可以看到这个城市的雏型的照片。建设这个城市是匈牙利人民生活中的重大事件。斯大林城的联合钢铁厂是匈牙利五年计划中最大的建设，这个工厂的投资约为五年计划工业总投资的十分之一。斯大林城将拥有由冶炼矿砂起直到制成辗金属为止的一系列的工厂和一个大的“十一月七日发电厂”、一个化学工厂、一个砖瓦厂、一个宽阔的现代化的内河不冻港，同时还要有一条长达九十公里的铁路，以及为缩短由港口到工厂运输线而建设的高架铁路等。联合钢铁厂已在去年十月革命节炼出了第一炉铁，等到它全部开工时，将使匈牙利的铣铁、钢和辗金属的产量增加一倍。“十一月七日发电厂”也于去年十月革命节开始供应电力给匈牙利工业生产了。
    由于工业的迅速发展，联合收割机、拖拉机、播种机等新的机械化的生产工具，已经在匈牙利的田野里工作了。大规模的机械化和苏联新生产方法的采用，使农业得以迅速的发展。这种发展给土地改革以后的农民指出了一条正确的道路——集体耕种的道路。个别耕种的农民愈来愈认识集体耕种的好处，每年参加生产合作社的人越来越多了，一九五○年国营农场和生产合作社的耕种面积，只占全部可耕面积的百分之十三，而一九五一年却增加到百分之二十五了。
    由于工业、农业的发展，劳动人民生活已大大提高。失业现象已经永远被消灭了。一九五○年工人人数增加了二十二万。机器制造业工人的工资基金在一年内提高了百分之三十七。劳动农民在一九五○年除了他们必需的用度外，每家平均积蓄了七百五十六元匈币。
    苏联对匈牙利的无私的援助，是匈牙利工业农业在短短的七年内获得伟大成就的重要因素。展览会的照片说明，苏联红军不仅解放了匈牙利人民，而且帮助他们重建被德国人破坏了的家园。在解放初期，饥饿笼罩着匈牙利，苏联人民用汽车把粮食运到布达佩斯。在执行三年恢复计划和五年建设计划时，美帝国主义百般利用反革命的残余分子进行破坏，而苏联人民则从技术、人力、设备方面给予大力的帮助。在建设斯大林城的伟大工程中，在建筑现场上工作着的拖拉机、挖掘机、测量器和起重机等现代化机械，有许多是苏联供给的。仅是用苏联的机器在现场上所掘的土方，就等于开凿巴拿马运河时所挖的土方总量的三分之二以上。在技术上，苏联专家也给以很大帮助，苏联著名的斯达汉诺夫工作者、高速砌砖工人马克沁明柯，乌拉尔的著名焊工阿莫索夫等都亲自去到工地，把苏联先进经验介绍给匈牙利的兄弟们，使他们改进操作方法，提高工作效率，从而加快了建设的速度。匈牙利人民永远感激苏联的帮助。在展览会里工作的匈牙利专家海德尼同志说：“只有苏联的帮助，我们才能走上社会主义的前途。”
    匈牙利人民把五年计划叫做“和平建设计划”，他们在这条战线上的伟大成就，无疑的将鼓舞我国的工人和农民，将加强我们建设的胜利信心。（附图片）
