    Hopes for Comrades in Literary and Art Circles

    To the Editor: I wholeheartedly support the judicial reform movement being carried out in various regions. In order to achieve victory in this struggle as soon as possible, we hope that comrades in literary and art circles can also participate in the movement and write relevant typical cases into plays, novels, crosstalk, drum lyrics, songs, or draw them as comic strips. Through these creations, we can educate the people about the seriousness of the harm caused by old legal viewpoints and old yamen work styles to the people, arouse the people's hatred, and form a force to promote and supervise the progress of this movement.

    对文艺界同志们的希望
    编辑同志：我衷心拥护各地开展的司法改革运动。为了尽快取得这一斗争的胜利，我们希望文艺界的同志们也能参加到运动中来，把一些有关的典型事例，写成剧本、小说、相声、大鼓词、歌曲或画成连环画。通过这些创作，教育人民认识旧法观点和旧衙门作风危害人民的严重性，激起人民的仇恨，形成一种力量来推动和监督这个运动的进行。
