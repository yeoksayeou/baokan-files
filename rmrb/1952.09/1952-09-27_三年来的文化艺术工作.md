    Three Years of Cultural and Artistic Work
    Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the Central People's Government

    According to Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program, the basic principles of new China's cultural and artistic work are to be oriented towards workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve them; to prioritize popularization and improve on the basis of popularization; to critically accept and promote the traditions of national culture and art; and to develop new cultural and artistic undertakings in a planned and focused manner. After three years of effort, our cultural and artistic work has achieved certain successes. The important ones are briefly described below:

    I. Developing people's cinema is one of the focal points of our work. In terms of cinematic artistic creation, we have produced excellent feature films such as "Steel Warrior," "The White-Haired Girl," "Daughter of China," "New Sons and Daughters of Heroes," "People's Warrior," "Victory of the Inner Mongolian People," "Zhao Yiman," "Red Flag on Cui Gang," and "Shangrao Concentration Camp." They profoundly reflect the various aspects of the Chinese people's struggle life, portray the new people's heroes with noble qualities who have emerged from the Chinese revolutionary struggle and peaceful construction, and vividly promote patriotism and internationalism. At the same time, we have also produced some excellent documentary films, such as "Million-Strong Army Crosses the Yangtze," "Triumphant Songs in the Great Southwest," "Red Flag Sweeping Across the West," "Great Unity of the Chinese Nationalities," "Happy Xinjiang," "Army Marching into Liberated Tibet," "Resist America, Aid Korea," "We Must Harness the Huai River Well," and the five-color documentary "Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China," co-produced with the Soviet Union. They truthfully record the glorious deeds of the Chinese people's revolutionary war and the construction of new China in various aspects. These excellent films have not only been universally loved by the broad masses of our people, but have also been widely welcomed and praised internationally. In international film festival competitions, our feature films "Daughter of China," "Steel Warrior," "People's Warrior," and documentaries "Great Unity of the Chinese Nationalities," "Resist America, Aid Korea," and others have won awards one after another. It is particularly necessary to mention that our news photography workers, standing at their combat posts, persisted on the front lines just like the soldiers, and some of them gave their precious lives for this.

    In the past three years, a total of 86 feature films (including 51 produced by private factories before 1951), 57 documentary films, and 101 translated films (from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries) have been produced nationwide. Before liberation, the film market in large cities was manipulated by American imperialism. Now, those pornographic films that promote the "American way of life" and carry out cultural aggression have been spurned by the audience. The number of moviegoers was 146.38 million in 1950, and has increased to 213.5 million in the first half of 1952; that is to say, this year, the average Chinese person can see a movie once. There are currently 757 cinemas and 1,800 projection teams nationwide. This is far from meeting the needs of the masses. Establishing a national screening network to bring movies to factories, rural areas, and remote areas is our current urgent task. Expanding the number of projection teams is the focus of film distribution work.

    II. Developing the people's drama and reforming the old opera are also one of the focal points of our work. China's opera heritage is extremely rich, with many types of local opera throughout the country. There are approximately 2,000 opera troupes and about 200,000 opera performers nationwide (not including amateur opera troupes in rural areas). Nearly one million people watch opera every day. Just looking at these numbers, you can imagine how important opera is in people's lives. In November 1950, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government convened a national opera work conference to review the progress of opera reform work in various regions and determine the criteria for reviewing repertoire. On May 5, 1951, the Government Administration Council issued instructions on opera reform work, clearly stipulating the correct policy of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new, let a hundred flowers bloom," which is to preserve and develop the excellent traditional parts of the old opera and remove its unreasonable and backward parts created by the long-term feudal society, so that it can become a national opera art that can educate the broad masses of people with the spirit of new democracy and patriotism. At the same time, it encourages the free development, mutual competition, and common prosperity of various operas.

    In the past three years, a preliminary screening of old opera repertoires has been carried out, and some repertoires will be designated as preserved programs. The number of newly arranged repertoires has increased year by year and has been welcomed by the broad audience. Local operas such as Pingju, Yueju, and Huju, as well as folk art forms, have achieved successful experience in expressing modern life. Old artists in major cities have generally undergone preliminary learning and improved their political awareness. Many artists have become the backbone of the opera reform movement after learning; some unreasonable systems in old opera troupes have been gradually reformed under the conscious and voluntary efforts of the artists. In order to strengthen the research and experimentation of opera art, improve the creation of opera art, and cultivate the next generation of new opera talents, the Chinese Academy of Opera was established in Beijing, and similar institutions for cultivating opera talents were also established in major administrative regions.

    There are approximately 250 literary and art work groups across the country that have grown up from the revolutionary war and mainly perform spoken drama, new opera, dance, and music. These literary and art work groups have long gone deep into rural areas, industrial and mining areas, and military units to carry out propaganda and education work in coordination with current political tasks; and have cultivated a large number of young literary and art cadres in their activities. They have performed new operas and dramas such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "Wang Xiuluan," "Liu Hulan," and "Red Flag Song" in various places, which have played a significant educational role for the broad masses of people. Starting this year, the literary and art work groups have been reorganized to determine the future direction of specialization: most of the literary and art work groups will gradually become specialized theater troupes mainly engaged in establishing and developing theater art, while another part of the literary and art work groups will still focus on touring performances and guiding and assisting mass cultural activities.

    III. New Year pictures and comic strips, which play a huge role in propaganda and education for the broad masses of people, are also significant. In 1950, a total of 412 types of New Year pictures were published nationwide, with a circulation of more than 7 million copies; in 1952, more than 570 types of New Year pictures were published, with a circulation of more than 40 million copies. The reason why New Year pictures are warmly welcomed by the masses is that they vividly express the lives and wishes of the working people and have the style of national art. The masses not only buy New Year pictures during the New Year, but also buy them at other times. In rural areas, New Year pictures have become a propaganda item with a broad mass base. In order to encourage the creation of New Year pictures, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government has held two New Year picture award ceremonies since 1950.

    The work of compiling and drawing comic strips (small picture books) has also made progress in recent years. Old comic strips with absurd content and hideous images have gradually been eliminated, and new comic strips with new content and beautiful images have gradually been able to partially meet the needs of readers. According to statistics from Shanghai, Beijing, and the Northeast in late 1951, a total of 2,000 types of new comic strips were published, with a circulation of more than 31 million copies. In order to guide and expand the work of comic strips, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House launched "Comic Strip Pictorial" in 1951, with a maximum circulation of 387,000 copies per issue.

    IV. The work of establishing a national cultural network and improving grassroots organizations has also achieved some success in the past three years. Libraries and museums are an important part of the cultural network. There are currently 59 public libraries above the provincial and municipal levels nationwide (excluding school libraries and other agency libraries), and 40 museums (14 of which are newly built). This number is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of the people. People's cultural centers and cultural stations are the broad grassroots organizations of the national cultural network. There are currently 2,436 cultural centers nationwide (almost one in each county) and more than 6,000 cultural stations (cultural stations are set up in districts below the county level). There are approximately 20,000 factories and rural clubs and libraries. Factory and rural clubs are mass organizations, and cultural centers and stations are responsible for providing guidance to them. The scope of work of cultural centers and stations includes publicizing current events and policies, popularizing scientific and health knowledge, organizing mass cultural and recreational activities, and promoting literacy education. They are in contact with the broad masses of urban and rural working people every day; therefore, enriching and expanding the organization of cultural centers and stations and strengthening the leadership of cultural centers and stations are important links in establishing a national cultural network. In addition to books and pictures, important equipment for cultural centers to carry out their work includes radios, slide projectors, and phonographs; slide projectors have become the most popular item among rural people and have a great educational effect. In order to further develop the slide projector business, adjust the production of slide projectors and slides, and improve the quality of slides, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government has now established the China Slide Projector Company.

    The above is the development situation of several important cultural and artistic undertakings. However, the central key to cultural and artistic work is the development and improvement of creation. In the past three years, various artistic creations have been far from meeting the needs of the rapidly developing country and people, but to a considerable extent and on a certain scale, they have reflected the history of the Chinese people's various struggles for liberation, and the new construction, new lives, and new faces of the motherland in the past three years. Among them, what is worth mentioning is that in terms of literary creation, there are works such as "Firelight Ahead" (Liu Baiyu), "Copper Wall and Iron Bastion" (Liu Qing), "Prairie Fire" (Xu Guangyao), and "Living People's Pond" (Chen Dengke) depicting the heroic struggle history of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Army; there are works such as "Who Are the Most Lovable People" (Wei Wei) depicting the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in resisting America and aiding Korea; and there are works such as "Registration" (Zhao Shuli), "New Things Done in a New Way" (Gu Yu), "Marriage" (Ma Feng), and "People of the Horqin Grassland" (Malaqinfu) depicting the new lives and new ideas of the working people after liberation. In terms of drama, operas such as "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" and dramas such as "Dragon Beard Ditch," "Growing Up in Battle," and "In the Face of New Things" have all truthfully reflected the struggle deeds and heroic spirit of the Chinese people in striving for liberation, defending the motherland, and creating a new life from various aspects.

    In music and fine arts, many excellent works have also been produced. Songs such as "People All Over the World Are of One Heart," "Ode to the Motherland," "Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," and "People All Over the World Unite Tightly"; New Year pictures such as "Zhao Guilan at the Heroes' Meeting" (Lin Gang), "Defend Peace" (Deng Shu), "The Bride Speaks" (Yan Han), and "Chairman Mao Talks with Farmers" (Gu Yuan) have powerfully expressed the Chinese people's love for the motherland, love for the leader, and determination to defend peace and defend a happy life.

    What needs to be specially mentioned is that many talented literary and artistic creators have emerged from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, Chen Dengke, the author of "Living People's Pond," and Gao Yuabao, who completed the first draft of his 200,000-word autobiographical novel, both came from poor peasant backgrounds; the authors of the scripts "Gate No. 6," "Not a Cicada," and "Loading and Unloading" are workers who directly participate in production labor. In the award-winning programs of this year's "August 1st" Army Day literary and artistic competition, many are works by ordinary soldiers.

    Due to the completion of land reform nationwide, and due to the improvement of the lives of the broad working people, the people's demands for culture and art are becoming more and more urgent. As mentioned above, cultural and artistic work has achieved some success in the past three years, but it is still far behind the people's demands. One of the main reasons is that there is a serious phenomenon of detachment from politics and detachment from the masses among literary and artistic workers; there are still problems such as anti-historicism and formalism in creative thinking; and the work of criticism and self-criticism is still not done well enough.

    The literary and artistic rectification movement that began at the end of last year exposed and criticized the root causes of ideological confusion in the literary and artistic circles, and pointed out that literary and artistic workers must study Mao Zedong Thought, must go deep into the masses, devote themselves to the actual struggle, and transform themselves, so that they can better serve the people. This is the largest ideological transformation movement in the national literary and artistic circles, with a total of 15,000 literary and artistic cadres participating in this rectification. This movement has yielded great results. After this movement, literary and artistic workers have dug into the roots of their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness, clarified the confusion of literary and artistic thought, corrected their creative attitude, and a large number of literary and artistic workers have gone to factories, rural areas, and military units to participate in the actual struggle of the masses, preparing the conditions for future development and improvement of the level of creation. In other words, it has prepared the conditions for the further development of national cultural and artistic work in the future.

    The above are the main achievements in cultural and artistic work in the new China in the past three years. Let our cultural and artistic workers and the people of the whole country work together to build a prosperous and happy new China!

    三年来的文化艺术工作
    中央人民政府文化部部长  沈雁冰
    依照毛泽东主席的指示和共同纲领的规定，新中国文化艺术工作的基本方针是面向工农兵，为工农兵服务；普及第一，在普及的基础上提高；批判地接受并发扬民族文化艺术传统；有步骤有重点地发展新文化艺术事业。经过三年的努力，我们的文化艺术工作获得了一定的成就。现在择其重要者，分别简述如下：
    一、发展人民电影是我们的工作重点之一。在电影艺术创作上，我们产生了像“钢铁战士”、“白毛女”、“中华女儿”、“新儿女英雄传”、“人民的战士”、“内蒙人民的胜利”、“赵一曼”、“翠岗红旗”、“上饶集中营”等优秀的故事片。它们深刻地反映了中国人民各方面的斗争生活，刻画了从中国革命斗争及和平建设中涌现出来的具有高贵品质的新的人民英雄，生动地宣扬了爱国主义与国际主义精神。同时我们也制作了一些优秀的记录影片，像“百万雄师下江南”、“大西南凯歌”、“红旗漫卷西风”、“中国民族大团结”、“欢乐的新疆”、“解放西藏大军行”、“抗美援朝”、“一定要把淮河修好”，以及与苏联合作摄制的五彩记录片“中国人民的胜利”和“解放了的中国”等。它们真实地记录了中国人民革命战争与新中国各方面建设的光辉事迹。这些优秀的影片，不但获得了我国广大人民普遍的爱好，在国际上也受到广泛的欢迎与赞誉。在国际电影节比赛会上，我国电影故事片“中华女儿”、“钢铁战士”、“人民的战士”等，记录片“中国民族大团结”、“抗美援朝”等，均先后得奖。这里需要特别提起的是，我们的新闻摄影工作者，他们站在自己的战斗岗位上，和战士们一样坚持在最前线，有的为此而付出了自己宝贵的生命。
    三年来，全国共制了故事片八六部（其中包括一九五一年前私营厂的出品五一部），记录片五七部，翻译片（苏联及人民民主国家的）一○一部。解放前，大城市中的电影市场素为美帝国主义所操纵，现在那些色情的、宣传“美国生活方式”的、进行文化侵略的有毒的影片业已为观众所唾弃。电影观众，一九五○年为一四六三八万人次，一九五二年上半年则已增加到二一三五○万人次；也就是说，今年我国人民平均每人可看到电影一次。全国现有电影院七五七所，放映队一八○○队。这距离群众的需要太远了。建立全国的放映网，使电影深入工厂、农村及边远地区，是我们目前急要之务。放映队的扩充，是电影发行工作的重点。
    二、发展人民戏剧事业，改革旧有戏曲也是我们的工作重点之一。我国戏曲遗产极为丰富，全国各地方戏曲种类繁多，全国戏曲团社约二千个，戏曲艺人约计二十万人（农村的业余剧团还未计算在内），全国每日观众近百万人。单看这些数字，就可以想见戏曲在人民生活中占了怎样重要的地位。中央文化部于一九五○年十一月召开了全国戏曲工作会议，检查了各地戏曲改革工作的情况，确定了审定剧目的标准。一九五一年五月五日政务院发布了关于戏曲改革工作的指示，明确规定了“推陈出新，百花齐放”的正确方针，这就是保留与发展旧戏曲的优良传统部分而去其不合理的、由长期封建社会所造成的反现实的落后的部分，使其成为能以新民主主义及爱国主义精神教育广大人民的民族的戏曲艺术，同时鼓励各种戏曲自由发展，互相竞赛，共同繁荣。
    三年来，对于旧有戏曲剧目已初步地做了甄别，一部分剧目将定为保留节目。新编排之剧目，年有增加，业已获得广大观众的欢迎。地方戏如评剧、越剧、沪剧等和曲艺，在表现现代生活上已取得了成功的经验。各大城市的旧艺人普遍经过了初步的学习，提高了政治觉悟。许多艺人经过学习后，成为戏曲改革运动的骨干；旧戏班社中的某些不合理的制度，已经在艺人的自觉自愿下逐步加以改革。为了加强戏曲艺术的研究与实验，提高戏曲艺术的创作，以及培养下一代新的戏曲人材，在北京设立了中国戏曲研究院，在各大行政区也有类似的培养戏曲人材的机构。
    从革命战争中成长起来的，以表演话剧、新歌剧、舞蹈、音乐为主的文艺工作团，全国约有二百五十个，这些文工团曾长期地深入农村、工矿区域、部队，配合当前各项政治任务，进行宣传教育工作；并在它的活动中培养了大批的青年文艺干部。它们在各地演出了“白毛女”、“王贵与李香香”、“王秀鸾”、“刘胡兰”、“红旗歌”等新的歌剧和话剧，对广大人民起了重大的教育的作用。本年起，整编文工团，确定了今后专业化方针：大部分文工团将逐渐成为以建立和发展剧场艺术为主的专业化剧团，另一部分文工团则仍以巡回演出，指导并协助群众文艺活动为主要任务。
    三、对于广大人民起着巨大宣传教育作用的，还有年画和连环画。一九五○年，全国共出版新年画四一二种，发行七百余万份；一九五二年出版新年画五百七十余种，发行达四千多万份。年画所以受到群众热烈欢迎的原因，是由于它生动地表现了劳动人民的生活和愿望，并具有民族艺术的风格。群众不但在年节买年画，平时也买。在农村中，年画成为具有广泛群众基础的宣传品。为了鼓励新年画的创作，中央文化部自一九五○年来，举行了两次年画评奖。
    连环画（小人书）的编绘工作，年来亦有进步。内容荒谬形象恶劣的旧连环画渐归淘汰，新内容及形象优美的新连环画渐已能部分地满足读者的要求。据一九五一年底，上海、北京、东北三地的统计，新连环画共出版二千种，发行三千一百余万册。为了指导及扩大连环画的工作，一九五一年人民美术出版社创刊了“连环画报”，每期销行最高数达三十八万七千册。
    四、建立全国文化网，健全基层组织的工作，三年来亦已获得若干成就。图书馆、博物馆是文化网中重要的一部分，全国省市以上的公共图书馆现有五十九所（学校图书馆及其他机关图书馆不在其内），博物馆四十所（其中十四所是新建的），这一个数目显然不能满足人民的需要。人民文化馆及文化站则是全国文化网的广大的基层组织。全国现有文化馆二千四百三十六个（差不多每县有一个），文化站（县以下的区设文化站）六千余个。工厂、农村俱乐部与图书室约计二万个。工厂、农村俱乐部为群众组织，由文化馆、站负责对它们进行辅导。文化馆、站的工作范围为宣传时事政策，普及科学、卫生知识，组织群众文娱活动，推行识字教育等等，每天联系着广大的城乡劳动人民；因此充实与扩充文化馆、站的组织，加强对于文化馆、站的领导，是建立全国文化网的重要环节。文化馆进行工作的重要设备除书籍图片而外，为收音机、幻灯机、留声机等；幻灯已成为农村人民最欢迎的东西，其教育作用极大。为了进一步发展幻灯事业，调整幻灯机及幻灯片、卷的制作，提高幻灯片的质量，中央文化部现已设立中国幻灯公司。
    上面所说，是几项重要的文化、艺术事业的发展情况。但文化、艺术工作的中心关键，是创作的发展和提高。三年来，各种艺术创作，远不能适应在突飞猛进中的国家和人民的需要，但也在相当程度内和一定规模上，反映了中国人民争取解放的各种斗争历史，反映了三年来祖国的建设和人民的新的生活、新的面貌。其中，值得提出的，在文学创作方面，描写中国人民和中国人民军队英雄的斗争历史的，有“火光在前”（刘白羽）、“铜墙铁壁”（柳青）、“平原烈火”（徐光耀）、“活人塘”（陈登科）等作品；描写中国人民志愿军抗美援朝的英勇事迹的，有“谁是最可爱的人”（魏巍）等作品；描写解放后劳动人民的新生活和新思想的，有“登记”（赵树理）、“新事新办”（谷峪）、“结婚”（马烽）、“科尔沁草原的人们”（玛拉沁夫）等作品。在戏剧方面，如歌剧“王贵与李香香”，话剧“龙须沟”、“战斗里成长”、“在新事物的面前”等，都从各方面真实地反映了中国人民争取解放、保卫祖国和创造新生活中的斗争事迹与英雄气概。
    在音乐和美术方面，也产生了不少优秀的作品。歌曲如“全世界人民心一条”、“歌唱祖国”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”、“全世界人民团结紧”等；年画如“群英会上的赵桂兰”（林岗）、“保卫和平”（邓澍）、“新娘子讲话”（彦涵）、“毛主席和农民谈话”（古元）等，都有力地表现了中国人民热爱祖国、热爱领袖的情感和保卫和平、保卫幸福生活的决心。
    特别需要提出的，是从工农兵群众中出现了不少有才能的文学艺术的创作者，如“活人塘”的作者陈登科，完成了二十万字的自传小说初稿的高玉宝，都是从贫苦的农民出身的；剧本“六号门”、“不是蝉”、“装卸”等的作者是直接参加生产劳动的工人。在今年“八一”建军节文艺比赛得奖节目中，有不少是普通战士的作品。
    由于全国范围的土地改革的完成，由于广大劳动人民生活的改善，人民对于文化、艺术的要求也越来越迫切。如上所述，三年来，文化、艺术工作是获得了若干成就的，但还大大地落在人民要求的后面。其主要的原因之一，是在文艺工作者中间严重地存在着脱离政治、脱离群众的现象；在创作思想上还存在着反历史主义、公式主义等等毛病；而对于批评与自我批评的工作，也还做得很不够。
    去年年底开始的文艺整风运动揭露并批判了文艺界思想混乱的根源，指出了文艺工作者必须学习毛泽东思想，必须深入群众，投身现实的斗争，改造自己，然后才能更好地为人民服务。这是全国文艺界最大规模的一次思想改造运动，全国参加这次整风的文艺干部，共达一万五千人。这一个运动是有巨大的收获的。经过了这一个运动，文艺工作者挖掘了自己的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想意识的根源，澄清了文艺思想的混乱，端正了创作态度，大批文艺工作者到工厂、农村、部队，参加了群众的实际斗争，为今后发展和提高创作的水平，准备了条件。也就是说，为今后全国文化、艺术工作的进一步开展，准备了条件。
    以上就是新中国三年来文化艺术工作上的主要成就。让我们文化艺术工作者和全国人民共同为建设繁荣、幸福的新中国而努力吧！
