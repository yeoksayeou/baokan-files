Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: The people of Pakistan are actively promoting the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing. Recently, the All-Pakistan Peace Committee issued a bulletin, which is being posted and circulated everywhere. The title of this bulletin is: "Save Pakistan from the War Crisis," "For the Peace and Freedom of Asia and Islamic Countries, Let Us Make the Peace Conference in China a Success." The bulletin states: Imperialists are rearming Japan, delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, and have used bacteriological and chemical weapons, threatening the peace and independence of some Asian countries. Peace-loving people in Asia, the Far East, and the world will never allow American and British robbers to shed the blood of young people in order to save the dying rule of imperialism and protect their so-called "civilization." In September, representatives of Asian countries will hold a peace conference in Beijing to discuss how to defend peace, freedom, and progress in Asia. The convening of this conference points out to us that peace-loving people in Eastern countries with different political views and religious beliefs are prepared to do everything possible to defend the peace and freedom of Asia and the Pacific, to smash preparations for a new war, to stop racial hatred and war propaganda, to ban the use of bacteriological, atomic, and chemical weapons, to stop the mass slaughter of peaceful people, to develop economic and cultural exchanges between countries, to oppose the arming of Japan and the establishment of aggressive bases, to strive for peaceful solutions to the problems of Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaya, to raise the living standards of ordinary people, and to create a happy life for women and children.

Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: Rangoon delayed news: The Burmese "People's Daily" published an editorial on August 3rd entitled "Deceiving the Masses," exposing the US United Press reporter's deliberate distortion of the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, attempting to deceive the people of countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. The editorial said: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has no intention of interfering in the problems of Burma or other Southeast Asian countries. On the contrary, this conference opposes any country's interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The editorial then pointed out: Some governments "themselves undermine the United Nations Charter, and in order to cover up their crimes, they accuse others of undermining the United Nations Charter in order to intimidate. The governments of capitalist countries habitually use this trick, pushing their various sins onto others." The United Press reporter pretended not to know the declaration publicly announced by the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and instead came up with a set of deceptive methods from his brain to intimidate the people of the world. The editorial concluded: All people with a sense of justice, after seeing the true content of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, "will clearly realize the deceptive conspiracy of these people to undermine the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing."

    全巴基斯坦和委会发行文告宣传和平会议
    缅甸“人民报”揭露美国记者的欺骗阴谋
    【新华社十九日讯】巴基斯坦人民积极宣传即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。最近全巴基斯坦和平委员会发行了一种文告，在各处张贴和传阅。这个文告的标题是：“从战争危机中拯救巴基斯坦”，“为了亚洲和伊斯兰教国家的和平和自由，让我们促使在中国召开的和平会议获得成功”。文告略称：帝国主义者正在重新武装日本，拖延朝鲜停战谈判，并已使用了细菌和化学武器，使亚洲一些国家的和平和独立遭受威胁。亚洲、远东和全世界爱好和平的人们，决不允许美、英强盗们为了挽救帝国主义的垂危的统治和护卫他们所谓的“文明”而使青年流血。九月间，亚洲各国的代表将在北京举行和平会议，讨论如何保卫亚洲的和平、自由和进步。这个会议的召开向我们指出：具有不同的政治见解和宗教信仰的东方各国爱好和平的人们，准备以全力来保卫亚洲及太平洋的和平和自由，粉碎新战争的准备，制止种族仇恨和战争宣传，禁止使用细菌、原子和化学武器，制止对和平人民的大规模屠杀，发展世界各国间的经济和文化交流，反对武装日本和建立侵略基地，争取以和平方式来解决朝鲜、越南、寮国、高棉和马来亚的问题，提高普通人民的生活水平，为妇女和儿童创造幸福的生活。
    【新华社十八日讯】仰光迟到消息：缅甸文“人民报”在八月三日发表题为“蒙蔽群众”的社论，揭露美国合众社记者故意歪曲报道即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，企图欺骗亚洲及太平洋区域国家的人民。社论说：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，对于缅甸或其他东南亚国家的问题，没有丝毫干涉的意图，相反地，这个会议表示反对任何国家干涉他国内政。社论接着指出：有些政府“自己破坏了联合国宪章，而为了掩盖自己的罪行，反而指责别人要破坏联合国宪章以进行恫吓。资本主义国家的政府就惯用这一套伎俩，把自己的种种罪恶推到别人身上”。合众社记者对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议公开宣布的宣言，就假装不知道，而另外从他的脑子里想出了一套欺骗的方法来恫吓世界人民。社论的结语说：一切有正义感的人们，在看到了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的真正内容后，“就都会很清楚地认识到这些人企图破坏即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的欺骗阴谋”。
