    The Great Power of Creative Marxism
    —Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Stalin's "Talk with the First American Workers' Delegation"
    By A. Lihaolate, Soviet Union

　　On September 9, 1927, the leader of the Soviet people, J.V. Stalin, held a conversation with the First American Workers' Delegation. The record of this conversation is a testament to the invincible great power of creative Marxism, a brilliant heir to Lenin's cause, and the genius of the great Stalin, a scientific giant.
　　In the "Talk with the First American Workers' Delegation," Stalin revealed the organic unity of Marxism and Leninism, and he elucidated with extreme clarity and depth Lenin's new contributions to the general treasury of Marxism. This is Lenin's advancement of the doctrines of Marx and Engels, which are suitable for the new era—the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.
　　Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of Leninism: Leninism is Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. He armed the cadres of the Bolshevik Party and the activists of the international revolutionary movement with a clear understanding of some of the most important issues of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Stalin instructed that Lenin, completely based on the principles of Marx and Engels, advanced the doctrines of Marx and Engels and adapted them to the new conditions of social development, to the era of imperialism. Comrade Stalin said: "Lenin was, and always remained, the most faithful and consistently thorough student of Marx and Engels, and he relied completely on the principles of Marxism." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 10, p. 92)
    When discussing the new contributions that Lenin made to the general treasury of Marxism, Stalin first pointed out Lenin's brilliant analysis of the new stage of capitalist development—imperialism. "At this time, the balanced evolution of capitalism has been replaced by the leap-forward, catastrophic development of capitalism, at this time, the imbalance and contradictions of capitalist development have become particularly acute, because at this time, under the conditions of this extremely unbalanced development, the struggle for markets to sell commodities and markets to export capital has made these periodic imperialist wars for the periodic redivision of the world and spheres of influence inevitable." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 10, pp. 93-94).
　　Comrade Stalin instructed that Lenin's contribution lies in his Marxist analysis of imperialism: imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism, revealing its profound contradictions and pointing out its inevitable demise.
　　Based on the law of uneven capitalist development that he discovered, Lenin made the brilliant conclusion that the victory of socialist revolution is possible first in several or even a single country. This is a new and complete theory of socialist revolution, which gave the Bolshevik Party and the working class a powerful weapon in the struggle to overthrow the capitalist system.
    In October 1917, the working class, in alliance with the poor peasants of Russia, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, completed the socialist revolution and opened a new era in human history. The victory of the October Socialist Revolution first broke through the imperialist front in Russia, and at the same time gave the world capitalist system a fatal wound.
　　After Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin, in the struggle to eliminate the Trotsky-Bukharin traitors, upheld and comprehensively developed Lenin's doctrine of the victory of socialism in one country, fully demonstrated the policy of national socialist industrialization, and formulated a rigorous theory of agricultural collectivization, thereby ideologically arming the Bolshevik Party and the entire Soviet people for the invincible socialist construction.
    The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union is the great triumph of Marxism-Leninism. This victory of world-historical significance for the Soviet working people dealt a devastating blow to the hypocritical "theories" of those right-wing social democrats who attempted to undermine the working class's confidence in its own strength and confuse the working class's only correct revolutionary struggle line.
    In the "Talk with the First American Workers' Delegation," Comrade Stalin pointed out some new issues that Lenin added to the theory of scientific communism, which are: the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the issue of the forms and methods of successfully building socialism in a country surrounded by capitalist countries during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the issue of the leadership of the proletariat in the revolution, and the issues of the national question in the colonies and the proletarian party.
    Comrade Stalin gave a comprehensive analysis of each of these fundamental issues of Marxist-Leninist theory, pointing out the great scientific and revolutionary significance of Lenin's thought for the socialist destiny of the Soviet Union and for all international workers' movements.
    Comrade Stalin paid great attention to the party and its role in the Soviet state. Everyone knows that right-wing social democrats and other protectors of capitalism maliciously attacked and are still attacking the Bolshevik Party, because the Communist Party is the only legal party in the Soviet Union, and it does not share its leadership with other parties.
    Comrade Stalin explained that there is a fundamental difference between the bourgeois parties that lead the governments of capitalist countries, act against the proletariat for the benefit of the bourgeoisie, and are closely linked to large banking groups and monopoly capitalists, and the Soviet Communist Party, which leads the country for the benefit of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The bourgeois parties conceal their leadership role from the people, and for this purpose, they organize their shady secret cabinets, while in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party does not need any secret cabinets, it denounces the policies and actions of the secret cabinets, and openly declares to the whole country that it assumes the responsibility of leading the country." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 10, p. 103)
　　The Bolshevik Party, created and nurtured by Lenin and Stalin, has experienced a glorious path of struggle, and it has grown and been tempered in the struggle against the enemies of the majority of the working people.
    The Bolshevik Party has won unlimited trust and love by serving the people selflessly. All the victories of world-historical significance of the Soviet people should be attributed to the heroic Bolshevik Party and to the brilliant leader and teacher Comrade Stalin.
    In his conversation with the American workers' delegation, Comrade Stalin revealed the great superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system, and he clarified that socialist industry and capitalist industry are fundamentally different.
    The impoverishment of the people of imperialist countries by means of exploitation, and the extraction of the greatest profits by means of enslaving and plundering the people of dependent countries and colonial countries, are the main driving forces of the imperialist economy. In the Soviet Union, the factories belong to the entire people, and the income from industry is used to improve the material and cultural life of the working people.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The realization that workers are not working for capitalists but for their own country, for their own class—this realization is the greatest driving force for the development and improvement of our industry." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 10, p. 119)
    Stalin's instruction on the peaceful coexistence of the two systems of socialism and capitalism is of great significance.
    The founders and leaders of the Soviet state, Lenin and Stalin, have repeatedly instructed that peaceful coexistence and international cooperation between the two systems are not only possible but also necessary.
　　In his conversation with the First American Workers' Delegation, Comrade Stalin, when talking about the agreements between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries in industry, trade, and diplomacy, said: "I believe that the existence of two opposing systems—the capitalist system and the socialist system—does not make such an agreement absolutely impossible. I believe that such an agreement is possible and appropriate in an environment of peaceful development." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 10, p. 123)
　　This argument of Stalin's can be proved by the many examples of economic, diplomatic, cultural, and other agreements concluded by the Soviet government with capitalist countries, which the Soviet Union has always strictly adhered to.
    In his speeches during the Great Patriotic War and in his talks with Roosevelt (1946) and Stassen (1947), in his replies to Wallace (1948) and Kingsley Smith (1949), and in other documents, Comrade Stalin has consistently emphasized that although the economic and ideological systems are different, the peaceful coexistence and cooperation between the two systems are "not only possible but also absolutely necessary in the interests of universal peace." (Pravda, May 18, 1948)
　　The coexistence of the two systems means peaceful competition between them. Experience shows that the socialist system is completely superior to the decadent capitalist system in this competition. The economy of socialist countries is becoming increasingly consolidated year by year, and the living standards of the Soviet people are rising day by day. At the same time, in capitalist countries, there is a growing phenomenon of unemployment, poverty, and hunger among the masses of the people and an intensification of contradictions between various groups in capitalist countries.
    The ruling groups in the United States, Britain, and other imperialist countries are deliberately strengthening their rule. They hope to turn back the wheel of history by means of military adventures. They are engaged in a frenzied arms race, reviving German and Japanese militarism, and forming aggressive alliances in order to launch a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. American and British interventionists have been waging the war of aggression against Korea and disrupting the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement for more than two years.
　　However, the powerful peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is standing in opposition to the reactionary camp of imperialism. The great movement to defend peace, which has tens of millions of people in countries around the world (including the United States, Britain, and other countries allied with imperialism), is growing and becoming stronger day by day. The people of all countries in the world do not want war. They are determined to block the path of the warmongers and defend the cause of peace. These words of the great Stalin are inspiring the working people of all countries: "If the people of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and persist in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated." (J.V. Stalin's interview with a "Pravda" reporter, February 16, 1951)
    The Soviet people are confidently looking at their own future. Under the brilliant leadership of the Bolshevik Party and under the guidance of the great Stalin, they are now successfully building communism.

    创造性的马克思主义底伟大力量
    ——纪念斯大林“与第一次美国工人代表团的谈话”二十五周年
    苏联　阿·黎豪拉特　 　 一九二七年九月九日，苏联人民的领袖约·维·斯大林与第一次美国工人代表团举行了谈话。这次谈话的记录是关于创造性马克思主义底不可克服的巨大力量，是关于列宁事业底英明的继承者、科学巨擘——伟大斯大林的天才的证明文件。
　　在“与第一次美国工人代表团的谈话”中，斯大林昭示了马克思主义和列宁主义的有机的一致，他极其鲜明地、深刻地阐明了列宁在马克思主义总宝库中所提供的新贡献，这就是列宁向前发展了马克思、恩格斯的学说，这种学说是适合于新的时代——帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代的。
　　斯大林同志给列宁主义下了经典的定义：列宁主义就是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。他用对马克思、列宁主义理论的一些最重要问题的鲜明理解来武装布尔什维克党的干部和国际革命运动的活动家。斯大林同志指示说，列宁完全根据马克思、恩格斯的原则，向前发展了马克思、恩格斯的学说而使其适合于社会发展底新条件，适合于帝国主义的时代。斯大林同志说：“列宁曾经是，而且始终还是马克思和恩格斯底最忠实和最一贯到底的学生，他是完完全全依靠着马克思主义底原则的。”（斯大林全集第十卷第九十二页）
    当论及列宁在马克思主义总宝库中所提供的新贡献时，斯大林首先指出列宁对于资本主义的发展新阶段——帝国主义——的天才分析。“在这时候，资本主义底平衡的进化已被资本主义底跃进式的，必然引起灾难恐慌的发展所代替了，在这时候，资本主义发展底不平衡性和矛盾已表现得特别厉害，因为在这时候，在这种极不平衡的发展底条件下面，为争取销售商品的市场和输出资本的市场的斗争，已经使这种为着定期重新分割世界及势力范围的定期帝国主义战争，成为必不可避免的了。”（斯大林全集第十卷第九十三—九十四页）。　
　斯大林同志指示说，列宁的功绩就在于他给帝国主义作了有根据的马克思主义的分析：帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段，揭露了它的深刻矛盾并指出了它的不可避免的死亡。　　列宁根据他所发现的资本主义发展不平衡性的规律而作出天才的结论说：社会主义革命首先在几个或单独一个国家内胜利是可能的。这是新的完备的社会主义革命论，他给予了布尔什维克党、工人阶级在推翻资本主义制度的斗争中以强大的武器。
    一九一七年十月，和俄罗斯贫苦农民结成联盟的工人阶级，在列宁、斯大林党底领导之下，完成了社会主义革命，开辟了人类史中的新纪元。十月社会主义革命的胜利，首先在俄国冲破了帝国主义战线，同时给予世界资本主义体系以致命的创伤。　　列宁逝世以后，斯大林同志在为肃清托洛茨基—布哈林叛徒的斗争中，坚持了并全面地发展了列宁关于社会主义在一个国家内胜利的学说，全面地论证了国家社会主义工业化的政策，制订了农业集体化严密的理论，从而对于所向无敌的社会主义建设，在思想上武装了布尔什维克党和苏联全体人民。
    社会主义在苏联的胜利就是马克思、列宁主义的伟大凯旋。苏联劳动人民这一具有世界历史意义的胜利，给予了那些企图破坏工人阶级对自己力量的信心、和混乱工人阶级唯一正确的革命斗争路线的右翼社会党人们的虚伪的“理论”以毁灭性的打击。
    斯大林同志在“与第一次美国工人代表团的谈话”中，指出了列宁添进到科学的共产主义理论中的一些新问题，这些问题就是：关于无产阶级专政的问题，关于在无产阶级专政时期被资本主义国家包围的国家中顺利建设社会主义的形式与方法的问题，关于在革命中无产阶级领导权的问题，关于殖民地的民族问题和无产阶级政党的问题。
    斯大林同志对这些马克思列宁主义理论的根本问题，逐个地给予了全面的分析，指出了列宁的思想对于苏联的社会主义的命运和对于所有国际工人运动的伟大科学的、革命的意义。
    斯大林同志对于政党及其在苏维埃国家中的作用给予了重大注意。大家都知道，右翼社会党人和其他资本主义的保护者恶毒地攻击了并还在攻击着布尔什维克党，因为共产党是在苏联国内唯一合法的政党，它不和其他政党瓜分自己的领导权。
    斯大林同志说明了：领导资本主义国家政府，为资产阶级的利益反对无产阶级，而与大银行团及垄断资本家们紧密联系起来的资产阶级政党，和领导国家为无产阶级的利益反对资产阶级的苏联共产党，两者之间是根本不同的。
    斯大林同志说：“资产阶级的政党在人民的面前隐瞒自己的领导作用，为着这个目的，便组织自己的形迹可疑的秘密内阁，而在苏联，共产党却不需要任何的秘密内阁，它斥责秘密内阁底政策和行为，并公开向全国声明，说它自己担负着领导国家的责任。”（斯大林全集第十卷第一○三页）　　为列宁、斯大林创建和抚养出来的布尔什维克党，曾经历了光荣的斗争道路，它是在和劳动人民底多数敌人的斗争中成长和锻炼起来的。
    布尔什维克党以奋不顾身地为人民服务而博得了无限的信任与爱戴。苏联人的一切具有世界历史意义的胜利，是应当归功于英勇的布尔什维克党，归功于天才的领袖与导师斯大林同志的。
    斯大林同志在与美国工人代表团的谈话中，昭示了社会主义经济体系对资本主义经济体系的巨大优越性，他阐明了社会主义工业和资本主义工业，是在原则上不同的。
    借助于剥削而使帝国主义国家人民的贫困化，和借助于奴役掠夺依赖国及殖民地国家的人民而汲取最大的利润，是帝国主义经济的主要推动力。而在苏联，工厂是属于全体人民的，工业的收入都是用在改善劳动人民群众的物质和文化生活上面。
    斯大林同志说：“觉悟到工人不是为着资本家作工而是为着自己的国家作工，为着自己本阶级作工——这种觉悟心就是我国工业发展和改善底极伟大的推动力。”（斯大林全集第十卷第一一九页）
    斯大林关于社会主义与资本主义的两个体系和平共存的指示具有重大的意义。
    苏维埃国家的缔造者和领导者列宁和斯大林不只一次地指示说，两个体系的和平共存与国际合作，不仅是可能而且是必须的。　　斯大林同志在与第一次美国工人代表团的谈话中，当谈及苏联和资本主义国家在工业、贸易、外交各方面的协定时，曾说：“我认为，两个彼此对立的制度——资本主义制度与社会主义制度——底存在，并不使这种协定绝对没有可能。我认为，这样的协定在和平发展底环境内是可能的和适当的。”（斯大林全集第十卷第一二三页）　　斯大林的这个论点是可以引出苏联政府和资本主义国家所缔结的经济、外交、文化以及其他协定，而为苏联始终严格遵守的许多实例来证明的。
    斯大林同志在伟大卫国战争时期的演说中以及和罗斯福（一九四六年）与史塔生（一九四七年）的谈话中，在答华莱士（一九四八年）和金哥斯贝利·斯密特（一九四九年）的复函中以及其他的文件中，曾始终不变地强调说，虽然经济体系和思想体系各不相同，但是两个体系的和平共存与两者之间的合作“不仅是可能的而且在普遍和平的利益上是绝对必需的。”（一九四八年五月十八日真理报）　　两个体系底并存意味着它们之间的和平竞赛。经验在指示着，社会主义体系在这个竞赛中，完全比衰颓的资本主义体系优越。社会主义国家的经济是逐年地越来越巩固，苏联人民的生活水平日益增涨着。可是同时在各资本主义国家则呈现着人民群众失业、贫困和饥饿现象的增长和资本主义国家各种集团之间矛盾的加剧。
    美、英和其他帝国主义国家的统治集团正处心积虑地加强自己的统治。他们指望借助军事冒险而把历史的车轮掉转回来。他们进行疯狂的军备竞赛，复活德国和日本的军国主义，并为了发动反苏和反各人民民主国家的战争结成侵略同盟。美英干涉者们进行侵朝战争和破坏订立停战协定已经有两年多了。　　可是，以苏联为首的强大的和平民主阵营正与帝国主义的反动阵营对立着。拥有世界各国（其中也包括美、英及与帝国主义同盟的其他国家）的数千百万人民的伟大保卫和平运动正在一天天地成长和壮大着。世界各国人民都不愿战争。他们决心堵塞战争贩子们的道路和保卫和平事业。伟大斯大林所说的这些话正鼓舞着世界各国的劳动人民：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够维护和巩固。”（一九五一年二月十六日约·维·斯大林对“真理报”记者的谈话）
    苏联人民信心百倍地在注视着自己的未来。他们在布尔什维克党的英明领导下，在伟大的斯大林的指导下，目前正顺利地进行共产主义的建设。
