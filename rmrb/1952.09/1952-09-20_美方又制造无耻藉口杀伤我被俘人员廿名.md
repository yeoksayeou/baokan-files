Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 19th: The U.S. side is now fabricating a new excuse to massacre prisoners of war. The U.S. prisoner of war command announced on the 18th that eleven more prisoners of war had been wounded on Koje Island because they were "strolling back and forth" in the playground.

Prisoners of war being killed and wounded for the crime of "strolling back and forth" has happened for the second time. The first time was on September 12th, when, according to the Associated Press, a total of nine prisoners of war were killed and wounded. Prior to this, the U.S. side also used absurd excuses such as "prisoners of war singing" and "prisoners of war escaping" in order to massacre prisoners of war. All of this shows that the U.S. side is determined to not even "comply" with the Geneva Convention in words. They have recently stopped mentioning this convention in regard to the prisoner of war issue, because they have searched the entire convention and cannot find a single provision that allows them to use force against prisoners of war under such excuses.

U.S. Air Force prisoner of war Quinn recently said, when answering questions from the International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, that there was a prevailing view in the U.S. military that international regulations such as the Geneva Convention were "not applicable to communists." The U.S. aggressors are obviously arbitrarily killing prisoners of war who firmly demand to return to their motherland based on this barbaric notion. This is the bloody truth hidden behind shameless excuses such as "prisoners of war strolling back and forth."

    美方又制造无耻藉口杀伤我被俘人员廿名
    【新华社开城十九日电】美方现在又制造了一种新的藉口来屠杀战俘。美方战俘司令部十八日宣称，巨济岛上又有十一名战俘被打伤，因为他们在操场上“来回蹓跶”。
    战俘被用“来回蹓跶”的罪名打死打伤，这已经是第二次了。第一次是在九月十二日，据合众社说，那一次被打死打伤的战俘共有九人。在此以前，美方为了屠杀战俘，还用过“战俘唱歌”、“战俘逃亡”等等荒诞无稽的藉口。这一切说明美方已经决心连口头上都不“遵守”日内瓦公约了。他们最近在战俘问题上也绝口不提这个公约，因为他们翻遍这个公约，也找不出一条允许他们在这样的藉口下对战俘使用武力的规定。
    美国空军战俘奎恩最近在回答调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会提出的问题时曾经说，在美国军队里流行着一种观念，认为像日内瓦公约之类的国际法规是“不适用于共产党的”。美国侵略者显然正在根据这种野蛮的观念而任意杀害坚决要求返回他们祖国的战俘。这就是掩藏在“战俘来回蹓哒”之类无耻藉口后面的血腥事实。
