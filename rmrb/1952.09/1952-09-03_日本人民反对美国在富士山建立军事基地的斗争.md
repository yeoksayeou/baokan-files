    The Japanese People's Struggle Against the U.S. Building a Military Base on Mount Fuji
    By Our Correspondent
    Mount Fuji, located in Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures on Honshu Island, Japan, is 3,778 meters above sea level, making it the highest mountain in Japan. The summit of Mount Fuji is covered with snow all year round, and the mountain has five beautiful lakes, many precious historical sites, and lush ancient forests; its scenery is beautiful from any direction, in any season. On the land at the foot of Mount Fuji, the Japanese people have diligently cultivated interconnected fields and built more than forty towns and villages. They have lived here for generations. The Japanese people love Mount Fuji, and they praise it as the "symbol of Japan"; Mount Fuji is also famous throughout the world for its picturesque scenery.
    However, under the U.S. policy of expanding military bases and stepping up preparations to launch new wars of aggression, the U.S. aggressors, disregarding Japanese sovereignty and national dignity, have been rudely seizing land on Mount Fuji as a military exercise base since 1946. Under the traitorous policy of the Yoshida government, the U.S. military's military exercise base on Mount Fuji has been expanding year by year. Land in ten towns and villages, including Gotemba Town in Shizuoka Prefecture, and villages in Minamitsuru, Higashiyatsushiro, and Nishiyatsushiro districts in Yamanashi Prefecture, totaling 37,000 cho (1 cho equals 0.99 hectares), has become a U.S. occupying forces' firing range. In these areas, U.S. military road graders have flattened mulberry groves, fields, and houses. Stray bullets often kill farmers working in the fields. Rampaging military trucks and jeeps often run over the elderly and children. U.S. soldiers arbitrarily break into farmhouses at night to rape women and rob property; countless sons have been shot by U.S. soldiers for protecting their mothers, and fathers for protecting their daughters. Before and after the U.S. launched its war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. military even built models of Korean villages with white clothes drying on lines at the foot of Mount Fuji, and held bombing exercises. The sound of guns and cannons shattered the tranquility of Mount Fuji; war deprived Mount Fuji of its peace.
    The farmers at the foot of Mount Fuji were already groaning under the exploitation of feudal forces and the heavy taxes and oppression of the Yoshida government. Now, the U.S. occupying forces have come to seize the fields they have cultivated for generations through hardship and starvation. They watch as U.S. soldiers drive tanks or ride horses, speeding through fields of tender seedlings in live-fire exercises, watch their loved ones die from stray bullets, their wives and daughters being violated, and watch U.S. soldiers seize the mountain's water sources, using sprinkler trucks to water the areas near the barracks, while the crops in the fields wither due to lack of water. Under these tragic circumstances, the farmers at the foot of Mount Fuji could no longer endure it and launched a resolute struggle against the U.S. occupying forces. On one occasion, when U.S. soldiers raped a Japanese girl in a village, the village youth rang the alarm bell, and many people, armed with wooden sticks and bamboo poles, beat the U.S. soldiers and threw them into the river. Afterwards, the workers who stood at the forefront of this struggle were arrested, and all the villagers rose up to fight. On the day of the so-called "military trial," the villagers flocked to the court to testify, and they finally won the victory in the trial. The arrested patriots walked out of the courtroom amidst the villagers singing the Internationale, and began a new struggle.
    The Yoshida government once used false propaganda to deceive the farmers at the foot of Mount Fuji, saying that the land could be "returned" after the "peace treaty" was concluded. The truth about the U.S. occupying forces' trampling on Mount Fuji has also been deliberately concealed. However, after the separate "peace treaty" "came into effect," the U.S. not only did not return the land it had previously occupied, but also openly demanded to the Yoshida government in May of this year to further expand the exercise base. The U.S. occupying forces wanted to occupy another 14,500 cho, including almost all of Mount Fuji, including the Hakone-Fuji National Park, and even turn the summit into a military base and prohibit Japanese people from climbing and sightseeing. When the Japanese people heard this news, they were filled with indignation, and protests arose across the country. All the people of Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures submitted a firm protest to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Yoshida government, demanding that the unreasonable demand for land acquisition be rejected. Under such strong protests, the so-called "U.S.-Japan Joint Committee," manipulated by the U.S., was forced to issue a statement saying: "The U.S. military will not use the summit of Mount Fuji for military exercises." The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Yoshida government also stated that it would conduct an on-the-spot investigation into the demands of the people of Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures. However, this was completely a blatant lie. In reality, the U.S. military is building a military base on Mount Fuji at an even faster pace. Now, the U.S. military has built a huge ultra-shortwave military radio station on the summit of Mount Fuji, three large barracks capable of accommodating 30,000 people have been lined up at the foot of the mountain, and an airport has been built. Japanese people are prohibited from entering the mountain everywhere, the U.S. military headquarters has moved to Gotemba, and an arc-shaped road that can reach Tokyo in half an hour has also been built.
    The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' increasingly rampant and barbaric acts of infringing on Mount Fuji have aroused the Japanese people's unparalleled anger and made them further realize that unless they drive out the U.S. occupying forces and overthrow the Yoshida government, they will have no way to survive. The farmers at the foot of Mount Fuji have grown in struggle. Self-defense teams have been organized in many villages such as Tamaho Village, uniting the strength of the whole village to carry out the struggle. They have posted leaflets in every village saying "Mount Fuji is ours!" "Return our land!" "U.S. occupying forces get out!" Farmers whose land has not yet been seized have also expressed "We will fight them to the death!" "We will not leave Mount Fuji even if it means death!" They are determinedly carrying out the struggle to "reclaim our Mount Fuji" together with the farmers whose land has been taken. Workers in Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures have also risen up to assist the farmers' struggle. Many progressive labor unions and democratic organizations in Japan organized "Mount Fuji Foothills Field Investigation Teams" to conduct investigations on Mount Fuji and published reports and communications in many progressive newspapers and magazines. The truth about the U.S. military's seizure and defilement of Mount Fuji and the Yoshida government's betrayal of the country has been revealed to the people of the whole country. The movement against the U.S. building a military base on Mount Fuji is spreading throughout Japan.
    The struggle against the U.S. building a military base on Mount Fuji is part of the Japanese people's struggle for independence and liberation, which will make the Japanese people's revolutionary anger against the U.S. occupiers burn more fiercely.

### 日本人民反对美国在富士山建立军事基地的斗争

    日本人民反对美国在富士山建立军事基地的斗争
    本报特稿
    富士山位于日本本州的静冈和山梨县境，海拔三千七百七十八公尺，是日本最高的山。富士山山顶终年积雪，山上有五个美丽的名湖，许多珍贵的古迹和苍郁古老的森林；一年四季从任何方向眺望，景色都很秀丽。在富士山麓的土地上，日本人民辛勤地开垦了阡陌相连的田地，兴建了四十多个市镇和村庄。他们世代相传地在这里生活着。日本人民热爱富士山，他们称誉它为“日本的象征”；富士山并以风光绮丽闻名于全世界。
    但是，在美国扩充军事基地，加紧准备发动新的侵略战争的政策下，美国侵略者毫不顾及日本主权和民族的尊严，从一九四六年起就粗暴地强占富士山的土地作为军事演习基地。在吉田政府的卖国求荣的政策下，美军在富士山的军事演习基地一年年地扩大着。静冈县御殿场镇等十个村镇和山梨县南都留郡、东八代郡、西八代郡一带村镇，数达三万七千町步（一町步合零点九九公顷）的土地，都变成了美国占领军的打靶场。在这些地区中，美国的军用修路机铲平了桑林、田地和房舍，流弹常常射死在耕作中的农民，横冲直闯的军用卡车和吉普车常常压死老人和小孩，美国兵夜间任意冲入农家蹂躏妇女和抢劫财物；儿子为了护卫母亲、父亲为了护卫女儿而被美国兵枪杀的事情不胜枚举。在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争前后，美军竟在富士山麓建造起晒着白色衣服的朝鲜村庄的模型，举行着飞机轰炸的演习。枪炮声震破了富士山的宁静；战争剥夺了富士山的和平。
    富士山麓的农民，本来就已呻吟在封建势力的剥削和吉田政府的重税高压下，现在美国占领军又来抢夺他们世代相传忍饥受寒开垦出来的田地。他们眼看着美国兵往来开着坦克或者骑着马疾驰在一片嫩苗的耕地中实弹演习，看着自己的亲人在流弹下死亡，自己的妻女被蹂躏，看着美国兵霸占了山地的水源，用喷水汽车在兵营附近洒水，而田地中禾苗却因缺水而枯萎。在这种悲惨的情形下，富士山麓的农民忍无可忍，向美国占领军展开了坚决的斗争。有一次，当美国兵在某村强奸一个日本少女时，村中的青年敲响警钟，许多人拿着木棍、竹竿把美国兵打落到河里去了。事后，站在这次斗争最前面的工人被逮捕，全村村民奋起进行斗争。在举行所谓“军事审判”的那天，村民们蜂拥到法庭里去作证，他们终于在审判中获得了胜利。被捕的爱国者在村民高唱国际歌的歌声中走出法庭，开始了新的斗争。
    吉田政府曾用虚伪的宣传欺骗富士山麓的农民说，“和约”成立后土地就可以“发还”了。美国占领军蹂躏富士山的真相也一直被有意地遮掩着。但是，单独“和约”“生效”后，美国不仅没有把从前占用的土地退还，并且在今年五月间公开向吉田政府提出要求，要把演习基地再度扩大。美国占领军还要再占用一万四千五百町步包括国立箱根富士公园在内的几乎是全部富士山的土地，连山顶也要变为军事基地，并且禁止日本人登山游览。日本人民听到这个消息后，无不气愤填膺，全国各地抗议之声四起。山梨和静冈两县全体人民向吉田政府的农林省提出了坚决反对征收土地的无理要求。在这样强烈的抗议下，美国操纵的所谓“日美联合委员会”被迫发表声明说：“美军将不使用富士山山顶进行军事演习”。吉田政府的农林省也表示对山梨、静冈两县人民的要求作实地调查。可是，这完全是一个漫天大谎。实际上美军正以更大速度在富士山建立着军事基地。现在，美军已经在富士山顶建成了巨大的超短波军用无线电台，山脚下已排列了能容纳三万人的三个大兵营，并建筑了飞机场；山上到处禁止日本人进入，美军司令部已经移驻到御殿场，半小时内就可以直达东京的弧形大马路也已经修好了。
    美、日反动派变本加厉地侵凌富士山的野蛮行为，激起了日本人民无比的愤怒，并且使他们更进一步认清了不赶走美国占领军、不打倒吉田政府，就根本不能有生路。富士山麓的农民在斗争中成长起来，玉穗村等许多村庄中都组织了自卫队，团结了全村的力量来进行斗争。他们在每一村庄都贴着“富士山是我们的！”“还给我们土地！”“美国占领军滚回去！”的传单。土地还没有被强占的农民也都表示“拚命也要干他一场！”“豁着死也不离开富士山！”他们和已被抢去土地的农民一起坚决地进行着“夺回我们的富士山”的斗争。山梨、静冈两县的工人也都起来协助农民们的斗争。日本很多进步工会和民主团体组织了“富士山麓实地调查团”到富士山进行了调查，并在许多进步的报纸杂志中发表了报告和通讯。美军强占和玷污富士山以及吉田政府卖国的实情，在全国人民面前被揭露了。反对美国在富士山建立军事基地的运动，正在日本全国各地扩展着。
    反对美国在富士山建立军事基地的斗争，是日本人民争取独立解放斗争的一部分，这将使日本人民反对美国占领者的革命怒火更热烈地燃烧起来。
