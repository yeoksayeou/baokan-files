    Scientists Unite to Save Peace
    Nuclear Physicist Zhao Zongyao
    Since the end of World War II, all good people around the world have longed for a happy life of peace. Only a small number of war instigators, headed by US imperialism, have violated this common will of mankind and intensified their activities of aggression. As everyone knows, in Asia, they have launched a war of aggression against Korea, occupied our country's Taiwan, and are still continuing to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, while actively reviving Japanese militarism. Their aim is to expand the war of aggression in Asia and further provoke a third world war. All these measures of US imperialism have seriously threatened the peace of the entire Asia and Pacific region. It is precisely for this reason that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was initiated. This conference will soon open in our country's capital. The representatives attending this conference, representing two-thirds of the world's people, will gather together to exchange views on how to save peace in Asia and the Pacific region. This conference will play a great role in defending world peace.
    We scientific workers hate war and hate imperialism's seizure of scientific achievements for use as weapons of murder. Scientists risk their lives to discover microorganisms and the laws of their transmission and elimination. Mankind is using this knowledge to conquer bacteria and viruses. But the US imperialists are cultivating a large number of poisonous bacteria, manufacturing murderous bacterial bombs, and have already used them in the Korean War. Scientists have worked hard for half a century, studying radioactive materials and atomic nuclei, to discover the energy hidden inside the atom and the mystery of using this energy. Mankind is celebrating that this energy will help peaceful construction. But the US imperialists are doing their best to plunder the raw materials of atomic energy, continuing to manufacture atomic weapons for use as capital for international blackmail, and attempting to realize the conspiracy of atomic war. How can scientific workers watch the fruits of these hard labors be used by imperialists for inhumane activities! Scientists with conscience, for the sake of rational dignity and human justice, can no longer remain silent. The righteous scientific workers of Japan, because the Japanese people have suffered the cruel experience of atomic bombings in the past, have risen up to refuse to do any more military-related work, which is a very powerful protest against war instigators. We especially hope that American scientists will unite and join the peace-loving people of the world in condemning the crimes of germ warfare and atomic warfare, and take on the responsibility of saving peace. As long as the people of the world unite, the threat of war in the entire Asia and Pacific region can be lifted, and lasting world peace will be guaranteed.

    科学家团结起来拯救和平
    原子核物理学家  赵宗尧
    第二次世界大战结束以来，全世界善良的人们都渴望能有和平的幸福生活，只有以美帝国主义为首的少数战争挑拨者才违反人类这一共同意志，加紧进行侵略的活动。人所共知，在亚洲，他们已发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，霸占了我国的台湾，现在仍继续拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，同时并积极复活日本军国主义。他们的目的是企图扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，进而挑起第三次世界大战。美帝国主义这种种措施，已严重地威胁着整个亚洲及太平洋区域的和平。正因为如此，所以有亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起。这个会议即将在我国的首都开幕了。出席这个会议的代表，将代表全球三分之二的人民，聚首一堂，共同交换如何拯救亚洲及太平洋区域的和平的意见。这个会议对于保卫世界的和平，将起伟大的作用。
    我们科学工作者痛恨战争，痛恨帝国主义攫夺科学的成果用作杀人的武器。科学家冒着生命的危险，发现微生物以及微生物传播和消灭的规律，人类正把这种知识用来征服病菌和病毒。美帝国主义者却培养大量的毒菌，制造杀人的细菌弹，并且已在朝鲜战争中使用。科学家经过半世纪的艰苦工作，从放射质和原子核的研究，发现原子内部蕴藏的能量以及利用这种能量的奥妙。人类正在庆幸着这种能量将有助于和平建设。美帝国主义者却尽量掠夺原子能的原料，继续不断地制造原子武器，用作国际讹诈的资本，并企图实现原子战争的阴谋。科学工作者怎能眼看这些辛苦工作的成果，被帝国主义者用来作违反人道的勾当！有良心的科学家，为了理性的尊严和人类的正义，不能再沉默下去了。日本的正义的科学工作者，因为日本人民过去受到原子弹屠杀的惨酷的经验，已经奋起拒绝再做有关军事的工作，实是对战争挑拨者的非常有力的抗议。我们尤其希望美国的科学家一致起来，与全世界爱好和平的人民共同谴责细菌战争和原子战争的罪行，担起拯救和平的责任。只要世界人民团结一致，全亚洲及太平洋区域战争的威胁，就可以解除，全世界的持久和平，就有了保障。
