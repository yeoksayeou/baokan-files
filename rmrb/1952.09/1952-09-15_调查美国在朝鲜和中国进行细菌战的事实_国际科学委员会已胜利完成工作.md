Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China has victoriously completed its work after two months of intensive effort, further confirming the use of bacteriological weapons by the U.S. military in Korea and Northeast China.

The International Scientific Commission was formed after the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in Oslo, accepting the invitation of Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. The members of the commission included:

    Mrs. Andrée (Sweden), Doctor of Medicine, Director of the Central Clinical Laboratory of the Stockholm Municipal Hospital Administration;

    Professor Madel (France), Director of the Animal Physiology Research Laboratory of the National Agronomic Institute of Grignon, former livestock expert for UNRRA, corresponding member of the Italian and Spanish Animal Husbandry Societies;

    Professor Pessoa (Brazil), Professor of Parasitology at the University of São Paulo, former Director of the São Paulo Provincial Department of Public Health, Honorary Professor of the Medical Schools of the Universities of Recife and Paraíba;

    Academician Zhukov-Verezhnikov (USSR), Vice-President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences and Professor of Bacteriology, former chief medical expert at the Khabarovsk Military Tribunal for the trial of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals.

In addition, the committee also included: Consultant Dr. Graziosi (Italy), Assistant at the Institute of Microbiology, University of Rome; Mrs. Pessoa, translation secretary to Professor Pessoa, and Mr. Kovalski, translation secretary to Zhukov-Verezhnikov.

Dr. Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and expert in nuclear physics, was unanimously invited by the committee to serve as the liaison officer of the committee.

The Chinese side accompanying the International Scientific Commission to Northeast China and Korea included:

    Liao Chengzhi, Vice-Chairman of the Reception Committee and member of the World Peace Council,

    Gong Naiquan, Secretary-General and surgical expert,

    Ji Suhua, Deputy Secretary-General and surgical expert;

    Expert Liaison Officers:

    Zhong Huilan, expert in infectious diseases,

    Wu Zaidong, expert in pathology,

    Fang Gang, expert in bacteriology,

    Zhu Hongfu, expert in entomology,

    Yang Shida, expert in public health,

    Yan Renying, expert in obstetrics and gynecology, etc.

The members of the International Scientific Commission arrived in Beijing successively on June 21st and 28th.

From June 23rd to July 9th, the committee conducted preparatory work for the on-site investigation in Beijing. During this period, the committee members studied in detail many documents previously provided by China and Korea, and discussed many scientific issues related to bacteriological warfare methods. On July 10th, the committee left Beijing for Shenyang to conduct a detailed investigation and research into the facts of the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare in Northeast China, which lasted half a month. The committee set out for Korea on July 26th and returned to Shenyang on August 6th. During its stay in Pyongyang, the committee investigated and studied in detail the facts of the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare in Korea. Throughout the investigation, the committee invited the Chinese and Korean sides to provide various scientific reports, re-examined physical specimens, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, observed many sites, and conducted detailed investigations and visits. Sometimes, they spent the whole day in the laboratory studying, and sometimes they held meetings until late at night to discuss a problem. During the investigation, the committee invited many scientific experts from China and Korea to give scientific reports and talks on the scientific nature of the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare. The committee members unanimously praised the pragmatic attitude and high scientific level of the Chinese and Korean experts.

During this period, the committee also met with U.S. Air Force prisoners of war who confessed to dropping bacteriological bombs in a certain place in northern Korea. There, in addition to interviewing the U.S. Air Force prisoners of war Enock and Quinn, who were already well-known to the people of the world, the committee also interviewed newly captured Air Force prisoners of war O'Neill and Knise. These four prisoners of war provided more detailed evidence to the committee about the U.S. military's dropping of bacteriological bombs.

The International Scientific Commission returned to Beijing on August 9th and immediately began drafting the report and checking the attachments, which was completed at the end of August, and the report signing ceremony was held on August 31st.

After completing their work and signing the report, the members of the International Scientific Commission also visited the exhibition of U.S. government bacteriological warfare crimes in Beijing.

Committee members Dr. Andrée, Professor Pessoa, and Professor Madel have left Beijing for their home countries in recent days.
