    "New Heroes and Heroines" Premieres in Moscow
    Starting from September 9th, twenty-five cinemas in Moscow simultaneously began showing the Chinese film "New Heroes and Heroines," with great success. The Russian translation of the novel "New Heroes and Heroines" by Kong Jue and Yuan Jing, on which the film's script is based, has recently been released in its second edition, and Soviet readers have shown great interest in the book.

    The Pravda newspaper published an article by Ovchinnikov on the 10th specifically regarding the film's premiere. The article pointed out that the screening of this film, which depicts the heroic struggle of the Chinese people during the War of Resistance Against Japan, has particular significance today, when Japanese militarism is being revived. Ovchinnikov said: Director Shi Dongshan did a good job of adapting "New Heroes and Heroines" from the novel into a film script, skillfully selecting several of the most important scenes from the novel, maintaining the unity of the theme and its consistent flow.
