    Zoya is Inspiring Us to Move Forward
    Comrade Editor: On August 23rd, the Youth League and Student Union of our school jointly organized a symposium on "The Story of Zoya and Shura." This symposium gave students a systematic understanding of Zoya's excellent qualities, and thus clarified what exactly we should learn from Zoya.
    Originally, some students believed that Zoya's environment was different from ours, that her living environment was superior to ours, that her family education was better than ours, and that her teachers' awareness and knowledge were stronger than our teachers. We have many difficulties in learning from her. Others thought that Zoya had outstanding talent, and we could not learn from her. After the debate, these problems were clarified, and a conclusion was reached: we can learn from her. The motherland has prepared favorable conditions for us, and Chairman Mao is educating us to become heroes like Zoya. The main problem is whether we work hard ourselves.
    The students all take Zoya as an example and strictly demand themselves. For example, when student Li Guojing encountered a difficult math problem, he was about to ask someone else, but thinking of Zoya's tenacious learning spirit, it increased his strength not to bow to difficulties, and he solved the problem himself. The students wrote Zoya's words to Shura, such as "You have no right to be unfaithful to your work!" "If you really understand, you have to prove it with facts! ... I don't like perfunctoriness. That's simply annoying!" and other sentences on their study notebooks as epigrams. Everyone is not taking this book as a pastime, but to absorb nourishment from it to nurture themselves. In addition to proposing to learn Zoya's tenacious learning spirit, serious attitude towards work, love for the Soviet motherland, and love for the leader, several students solemnly proposed on the spot to constantly train themselves, strive to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the Communist Party, and strive for a happy socialist tomorrow. Some people also announced their efforts on the spot and expressed their determination to make progress.
    This symposium was relatively successful, and the participating students were all moved by Zoya's heroic deeds. Zoya's name has become the banner of our youth, and Zoya will always inspire us to move forward bravely!

### 卓娅在鼓舞我们前进

    卓娅在鼓舞我们前进
    编辑同志：八月二十三日，我们学校青年团和学生会联合组织了一次“卓娅和舒拉的故事”座谈会。通过这个座谈会使同学们对卓娅的优良品质有一个系统的了解，因而明确了到底应该向卓娅学习什么。
    原先有些同学认为卓娅所处的环境和我们不同，她的生活环境比我们优越，家庭教育比我们的好，老师的觉悟和学识比我们的老师强，我们学习她有很多的困难。有的则认为卓娅有杰出的天才，我们学不了她。经过争论，才搞清楚这些问题，得出一个结论：我们是能够学习她的，祖国给我们准备了有利的条件，毛主席正在把我们教育成为卓娅式的英雄，主要的问题是要看我们自己是否努力。
    同学们都以卓娅为榜样，严格地要求自己。如李国经同学有一次遇到了数学难题，正想去问别人，想到卓娅顽强的学习精神，就增加了他不向困难低头的力量，自己解答了难题。同学们把卓娅对舒拉说的话，如“你没有权不忠实地对待自己的工作！”“如果你真懂，你就要用事实来证明！……我不喜欢敷衍了事。那样简直是讨厌！”等写在自己的学习本上作为警句。大家都不是拿这本书作为消遣，而是要在它里面吸取养料，哺养自己。会上除提出学习卓娅顽强的学习精神、认真的对待工作、热爱苏维埃祖国、热爱领袖等精神以外，当场就有好几个同学郑重地提出要不断锻炼自己，争取加入中国新民主主义青年团、共产党，为争取幸福的社会主义的明天而奋斗。有的人还当场宣布了自己努力的计划，表示自己要求进步的决心。
    这个座谈会是开得比较成功的，与会同学一致为卓娅的英雄事迹所感动。卓娅的名字成了我们青年的旗帜，卓娅将永远鼓舞着我们勇敢前进！
