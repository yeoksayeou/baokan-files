Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Preface to the Report of the International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China (original text appears on page two of today's newspaper). The full text is as follows:

    Since the beginning of 1952, abnormal phenomena have occurred in northern Korea and northeastern China, leading the people and governments of these two countries to claim that they have become the target of bacteriological warfare.

    The people of the world have long expressed opposition and even abhorrence to this method of warfare, so the seriousness of the situation is well known. Therefore, an International Scientific Commission was established to go to the site to investigate the facts.

    The members of the commission, recognizing the importance of their responsibility, endeavored to rid themselves of preconceptions and, with the highest degree of objectivity, followed the strictest scientific principles known to them in conducting the investigation.

    This report provides the detailed content of the work and the conclusions drawn therefrom to the reader.

    This report was written through the cooperation of eight languages. Therefore, it does not adhere to literary style, but strives for clarity and precision so that people all over the world can understand it.
