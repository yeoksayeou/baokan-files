Under the care of the People's Government and the cultivation of Party and trade union organizations, a large number of outstanding workers in People's China have become important cadres in the country's economic construction. According to materials statistics from some areas of Northeast, Southwest, Northwest, North China, East China, and Central South, more than 127,000 workers have been promoted to administrative, trade union cadres, and technical management personnel at all levels, or transferred to state power organs in the past three years. These outstanding workers include Zhao Guoyou, a lathe worker from Northeast Machine Factory No. 3, Li Yong, the driver of the national locomotive banner "Mao Zedong," and national model workers Liu Yingyuan, Zhao Zhankui, Liu Guoxi, Dai Kedu, Zhang Shibao, Liu Maoyou, Pan Changyou, national railway model workers Sun Lianfu, Meng Guangsheng, Yang Chuncheng, and other thousands of advanced producers and model figures. Among them, Zhao Guoyou and Li Yong have served as the deputy director of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the vice chairman of the National Railway Trade Union, respectively. Zhao Zhankui served as the deputy director of the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and others have taken up positions as factory directors and deputy factory directors. In addition, model figures who emerged in the movements of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti," such as Dong Fusheng, a worker from Yunnan Kunming Electrical Engineering Equipment Factory who overcame difficulties to repair the reverberatory furnace, and Yu Chunyin, the leader of the patrol team at Maigen Road Station of the Shanghai Railway Branch Bureau, who resolutely fought against illegal merchants and embezzlers, were promoted to positions such as workshop director and deputy director of general affairs, respectively.

The promotion of a large number of outstanding workers to become cadres has not only encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses but also brought a new atmosphere to the people's enterprises. The Capital Shijingshan Power Plant, led by the famous labor models Liu Yingyuan and Wang Wenbin, two worker factory directors, has made great achievements in the past three years. In 1950, the plant solved the problem of coal powder leakage that had been unsolved for a long time during the Japanese puppet rule, and the power generation reached the highest record since the establishment of the factory. In 1951, the plant created a new record of 185 days of safe operation for the entire plant. This year, the workers of the entire plant studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, ensuring to increase production and save 15 billion yuan of wealth for the country, and strive to reach 17.5 billion yuan. Huang Runping, a comrade from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, who was newly promoted from worker to deputy section chief of the warehouse, recently created a new method of warehouse management. This method overcomes the disconnection between production, supply and marketing, and warehouse management in enterprises for a long time, and points out a new direction for warehouse management in our country. This method is now being promoted nationwide.

The fact that activists among the broad masses of workers can participate in the leadership of national enterprises and other fields is the result of continuous cultivation and education by the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and trade union organizations. In the Northeast region alone, according to materials up to the end of last year, more than 30,000 worker cadres have been trained for the country through political universities and training classes in various provinces and cities, and there will be an increase this year. In addition, national institutions of higher learning have also opened their doors to the working people, and a large number of outstanding workers have participated in the study. With the development of production, cultivating and promoting cadres from the working class has become a major task. It is estimated that in the next five or six years, the country's economic construction will need about 150,000 senior technical and management cadres, and about 500,000 middle and junior technical cadres. In order to complete this task, in addition to planned training in institutions of higher learning, trade union organizations in many places have now begun to adopt the method of rotational training to deliver a large number of worker cadres to the country. Zhejiang Province has planned to train 50,000 worker activists in the second half of this year and will train another 1,000 worker cadres for the country through worker cadre schools. Shandong and Shanxi provinces will also cultivate and promote 4,500 and 2,000 worker cadres for the country respectively in the second half of this year in the same way.

    大批优秀工人参加经济建设的领导工作
    在人民政府的关怀、党和工会组织的培养下，人民中国的大批优秀工人已成为国家经济建设中的重要干部。仅据东北、西南、西北、华北和华东、中南等地部分地区的材料统计，三年来，工人被提拔为各级行政、工会干部和技术管理人员或输送至政权机关的，约十二万七千余人。在这些优秀的工人中，包括了东北机器三厂的车工赵国有、全国机车旗帜“毛泽东号”司机长李永和全国劳动模范刘英源、赵占魁、柳国喜、戴可都、张世宝、刘茂有、潘长有，全国铁路劳动模范孙连福、孟广生、杨春承等数千名先进生产者和模范人物。其中，赵国有和李永两人曾分任了中华全国总工会生产部副部长和全国铁路工会的副主席，赵占魁当了西北军政委员会劳动部的副部长，其他都分别担负了厂长、副厂长等职。此外，在抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”等运动中所涌现的模范人物，如克服困难补修反射炉的云南昆明电工器材厂工人董福生，和坚决与不法商人、贪污分子作斗争的上海铁路分局麦根路站巡守组组长于春银等，亦分别被提拔为车间主任和副总务主任等职。
    大批优秀工人的被提拔为干部，不仅鼓舞了群众的生产积极性，并给人民企业带来了新的气象。由著名劳动模范刘英源和王文斌两位工人厂长领导的首都石景山发电厂三年来已有很大成绩。一九五○年，该厂曾解决了日伪统治时长期无法解决的跑煤粉问题，发电量达到了建厂以来的最高纪录。一九五一年，该厂又创造了全厂安全运转一百八十五天的新纪录。今年，全厂工人学习了苏联先进经验，保证要给国家增产节约一百五十亿元的财富，并争取达到一百七十五亿元。新由工人提拔为仓库副股长的华北农业机械总厂的黄润萍同志，最近曾创造了仓库管理的新方法。这一方法，克服了过去长期以来企业中的生产、供销和仓库管理的脱节现象，给我国仓库管理工作指出了一个新的方向。这个方法，现在已在全国推广。
    大批工人群众中的积极分子能以参加国家企业等方面的领导工作，是中国共产党、人民政府和工会组织对他们进行不断的培养教育的结果。仅仅东北地区，据截至去年底的材料，经过政治大学和各省市训练班，即为国家培养了三万多名工人干部，今年还有增加。此外全国的高等学校也给劳动人民开了门，为数众多的优秀工人都参加了学习。随着生产的发展，培养和提拔工人阶级出身的干部已成为一个重大的任务。据估计，在今后五、六年内，全国经济建设所需要的高级技术干部和管理干部将达十五万人左右，中级和初级技术干部需约五十万人左右。为着完成此一工作，除了在高等学校中有计划地进行培养外，不少地方的工会组织现已开始了采用轮训的方法，为国家输送大批工人干部。浙江省已计划在今年下半年内，训练五万名的工人积极分子，并将通过工人干部学校再为国家训练一千名工人干部。山东、山西两省亦将在今年下半年内以同样的方式分别为国家培养和提拔四千五百名和两千名的工人干部。（本报综合消息）
