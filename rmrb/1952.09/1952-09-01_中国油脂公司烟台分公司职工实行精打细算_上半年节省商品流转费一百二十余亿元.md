China National Oils and Fats Corporation Yantai Branch Workers Practice Careful Calculation and Strict Budgeting
Saving Over 12 Billion Yuan in Commodity Circulation Costs in the First Half of the Year

The entire staff of the China National Oils and Fats Corporation Yantai Branch and its five subordinate branch companies (Weihai, Dashuibo, Xiacun, Zangjiazhuang, and Biguo) overfulfilled the procurement, warehousing, transportation, and export loading tasks for the first half of the year, saving the state over 12.26 billion yuan in commodity circulation expenses.

The Yantai Branch saved a total of 3.88318 billion yuan in transportation costs in the first half of the year. This was the result of mastering and being familiar with transportation routes and conditions, practicing careful calculation and strict budgeting, and establishing close ties with brother companies to reduce empty trips. In order to accelerate commodity turnover and reduce expenses, the company opened two new transshipment ports, Lidao and Wodao. From then on, the commodities purchased and sold by the Weihai and Dashuibo branch companies in the eastern region could be directly transported from the primary market to the port for transshipment, reducing intermediate links and saving a large amount of expenses.

The company saved a total of 6.52343 billion yuan in selection, sorting, and packaging costs. This was the result of effectively mastering the established standards during procurement. In the first half of the year, the Yantai Branch's business section directly purchased bulk peanut kernels (suitable for export standards), which eliminated the need for selection and sorting fees. The company's storage and transportation section promoted this method to the branch companies and publicized the specifications and standards of various commodities to the masses through cooperatives. The masses knew what the company needed and prepared it themselves. As a result, the peanut kernels purchased by the company all met the standards. In the first half of the year, the company purchased more than 35,800 tons of peanut kernels that met the bulk standard, saving an average of 46,700 yuan per ton in selection and sorting fees. This not only saved the country a lot of money, but also educated the farmers, enabling them to start improving peanut varieties according to economic needs. The implementation of this procurement method gradually changed the trading habits of the fresh fruit market. In the areas under the jurisdiction of the Biguo and Zangjiazhuang branch companies, the masses used to sell peanuts in the shell. The company explained to the masses the benefits of selling kernels without shells to both the masses and the country. The masses generally sold kernels without shells, which reduced sorting and transportation costs. In terms of saving packaging costs, the company implemented methods to increase the number of times and the length of time packaging supplies were used. The company and its subordinate units used burlap sacks one to one and a half times more than the number of times stipulated by the provincial company, reducing the depreciation cost of packaging supplies.

The company also practiced careful calculation and strict budgeting in loading and unloading, handling, storage, commodity insurance, natural commodity losses, procurement handling fees, interest, and operating management fees. The company also mastered the terrain, wind direction, and seasonal conditions, and properly stacked and sealed goods according to the different qualities of the goods, striving to reduce the number of times most peanut kernels had to be restacked. As a result, the company reduced the loss of peanut kernels by 104,676 jin in the first half of the year compared to the central government's stipulated loss standard. (Shao Bingyun)

    中国油脂公司烟台分公司职工实行精打细算
    上半年节省商品流转费一百二十余亿元
    中国油脂公司烟台分公司和所属五个支公司（威海、大水泊、夏村、臧家庄、毕郭），全体职工超额完成上半年的收购、仓储运输及装船出品任务，给国家节省商品流转费用一百二十二亿六千多万元。
    烟台分公司半年共节省运费三十八亿八千三百十八万元。这是掌握与熟悉了运输路程和运输条件，实行精打细算，和兄弟公司取得密切联系，减少空驶费的结果。为了加速商品周转，减低费用开支，该公司开辟了俚岛与倭岛两个新的转运港口。从此，威海与大水泊两支公司在东部收售的商品，可从初级市场收起，直接运至港口转出，减少了中间环节，节省了大批费用。
    该公司在挑选、整理、包装费用方面，共计节省了六十五亿二千三百四十三万元。这是在收购时切实掌握了既定标准的结果。上半年烟台分公司业务科直接收购大路货花生米（适合出口标准），这就省去了挑选整理费。该公司储运科把这一方法推广到支公司，并通过合作社向群众宣传各种商品的规格和标准。群众知道了公司需要什么，自己就去准备什么，结果，公司收购的花生米都合标准。上半年该公司共收购符合大路货标准的花生米三万五千八百多吨，每吨平均可省去挑选整理费四万六千七百元。这不仅给国家节省了大量费用，同时也教育了农民，使他们根据经济的需要，开始改进花生品种。实行这种收购办法，并逐渐改变了生果市场的交易习惯。毕郭与臧家庄两支公司所辖地区的群众，过去都是出卖带壳花生。公司向群众说明了去壳卖仁对群众和对国家的好处，群众普遍去壳卖仁，这就减少了整理和运输费用。在节省包装费用方面，该公司实行了增加包装用品的使用次数和使用时间的办法。该公司及所属单位上半年使用麻袋的次数比省公司规定的使用次数增多一次到一次半，减少了包装用品的折旧费。
    该公司在装卸、搬运、保管、商品保险、商品自然损耗、收购手续费、利息、经营管理费等方面，也都作到精打细算，该公司并掌握了地势、风向、季节情况，根据货品质量的不同，适当地码垛封存，争取大部分花生米少捣垛。结果，上半年较中央规定的损耗标准减少了十万四千六百七十六斤花生米的损耗。（邵炳韵）
