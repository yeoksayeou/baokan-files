Socialism and Egalitarianism are Incompatible
    Chen Dake
    In our countryside, some people say, "In the collective farm, there is no distinction between you and me; yours is mine, and mine is yours." "When we reach communist society, we can work if we want, eat if we want, and take whatever we need." This misunderstands socialism and communism as egalitarianism. Members of the Chinese peasant delegation, during their visit to the Soviet Union, saw the true face of the collective farm with their own eyes, realized that a happy life is inseparable from labor, and understood that socialism is not egalitarianism. Zhao Huaiyi, a model agricultural worker from Henan Province, said, "In the past, bad elements spread rumors that collective farms were about communal ownership of property and wives, which I half-believed. Some people asked me, 'If agriculture is collectivized, will we still have to work the fields?' I couldn't answer. To be honest, I had many concerns about agricultural collectivization myself. This time, seeing the lives of Soviet collective farm peasants, I realized it's not like that at all. They implement a system of 'more work, more pay,' and the division of labor and calculation of work are more scientific, fair, and reasonable than ever before. This completely resolved the doubts in my mind." Liu Tizhong, another model agricultural worker from Henan Province, said, "I had heard before that 'Soviet peasants eat four taels of meat every day,' but I didn't know where the meat came from. Now I know that the meat doesn't fall from the sky, nor is it distributed by the government; it's earned through their own labor."
    The Method of Calculating "Labor Days" is Really Good
    What exactly is "remuneration according to labor" in collective farms? The Soviet Union, with years of accumulated experience, has created a very scientific set of methods. To ensure fair and reasonable distribution, they adopt a piece-rate wage system. The amount of land to be planted each day, the amount of land to be plowed, and the amount of grain to be harvested per hectare are all determined by the district Soviets and the farm, based on national instructions and actual conditions, and approved by the general meeting of farm members. After the national planned production figures are allocated to the farm, the farm allocates them to the work teams, the work teams then allocate them to the production groups, and the groups then allocate them to each individual. Each team, group, and individual has a fixed plot of land (referring to intertilled crops; wheat crops are only allocated to the team, not fixed to a group or individual). It does not change for a certain period (it can be changed after a certain period through democratic discussion). The number of labor days required for a plot of land and the amount of work required to count as one labor day are all stipulated. Work that is stipulated to require twenty labor days, if completed in ten days, still counts as twenty labor days. If land that is expected to yield 10,000 jin of grain yields 12,000 jin, in addition to earning extra labor days, a bonus of 25 percent of the excess in kind is awarded. Zhang Xuexiu, a model agricultural worker from Pingyuan Province, said, "We only established an agricultural production cooperative last year, and we haven't had a good method for how to divide labor and evaluate work. This time in the Soviet Union, we learned the method. One collective farm stipulates ten labor days per hectare of land to harvest thirty quintals of wheat per year; if a team harvests forty-five quintals per hectare, they are given an additional five labor days and 25 percent of the excess fifteen quintals is awarded to the work team. The work team distributes it according to the amount done by each group, and each group distributes it to each individual according to the amount done by each person. The same rainfall, the same land, if some teams, groups, or individuals do not meet the production standard, labor days will be deducted. If the entire farm's cultivated land suffers natural disasters, the standard will be lowered for the entire farm. However, those with high yields will still be rewarded, and those with low yields will still have labor days deducted."
    Deng Guozhang, a model agricultural worker from Songjiang Province, said, "This method is really good. This spring, our village (Qiangkeng Village, District 9, Boli County, Songjiang Province) established an agricultural production cooperative and implemented a method of calculating wages based on the number of labor days spent by members. This method of calculating work by the day does not differentiate between the diligent and the lazy. When the provincial model agricultural workers met, everyone discussed how to record and evaluate work fairly and reasonably; although a method was discussed, there was no standard quota, no fixed division of labor, and when evaluating work, everyone wanted to give themselves a higher evaluation, so it was still not truly reasonable; the work in the fields also often suffered from a lack of responsibility, and the quality was poor. In the spring, we bought fifty sheep and five pigs and found an elderly person to take care of them. Everyone had no idea how to calculate his work. This time, visiting the Khrushchev Collective Farm in the Poltava District of Poltava Oblast, we solved this problem. The method they implemented was both meticulous and reasonable. Female member Lava is a labor hero. Last year, she managed ten sows and planned to have 150 piglets in a year. According to regulations, each piglet born earns three labor days. As a result, her sows had 190 piglets, so she earned 570 labor days. Her piglets exceeded the plan by 40, and according to regulations, she was awarded one piglet for every five extra piglets raised, so she earned another eight piglets as a reward. According to regulations, each piglet that grows to twelve kilograms in the first two months counts as four labor days (after the piglets grow to two months, they are handed over to those who raise meat pigs, and every ten kilograms of growth counts as one labor day). Her piglets were all raised very well, and she earned another 190 labor days in a year. With such a good method, who wouldn't be motivated to work hard? This is truly the best treasure we brought back from the Soviet Union!" Li Shunda said, "They have even stipulated the methods for calculating labor days for raising chickens and ducks. Raising 1,000 chickens for one day counts as one labor day, and every 500 eggs laid counts as one labor day; raising 500 ducks for one day counts as one labor day, and every 150 duck eggs laid counts as one labor day; raising 150 geese for one day counts as one labor day, and every 25 goose eggs laid counts as one labor day. If you want the chickens, ducks, and geese to lay more eggs, you have to find ways to raise them well. This method is the most encouraging to labor." Wu Fengqi, a model agricultural worker from Liaodong Province, said, "The Soviet Union has uniformly divided the various tasks of the collective farm into nine grades. Those who complete the standard quota (the standard quota is determined by the farm itself based on local conditions) for the first grade of work in one day are counted as half a labor day; each higher grade adds a quarter of a labor day, the fourth grade counts as one labor day, and the seventh grade counts as two labor days. Which type of work counts as which grade is all printed in a book, and when calculating labor days for any type of work, you can find it in the book, which is very convenient. By doing this, there is no unreasonable labor remuneration. When we first organized mutual aid teams in 1948, everyone thought it was too much trouble, and we didn't keep records or accounts, which resulted in many opinions and unstable mutual aid teams. In 1949, we started keeping records, but we didn't evaluate work. Even if someone did exceptionally well, they were only counted as one labor day, which dissatisfied the production experts. Later, we evaluated work, but because there was no quota, we evaluated it randomly, and the evaluation was still unreasonable." The members of the delegation all felt that the Soviet collective farm's method of setting quotas and quality standards, dividing labor and assigning responsibility was good. Although we cannot yet achieve such detail, the basic principles of those methods can be immediately applied in production cooperatives. Thoroughly Smash Egalitarianism
    The Soviet collective farm's method of calculating labor remuneration has thoroughly shattered the egalitarian ideas of many people. Zhao Fuya, a model agricultural worker from northern Jiangsu, said, "The loafers in our area are waiting for 'socialism,' and some middle peasants are afraid of 'socialism.' They all look at socialism with an egalitarian perspective. Some people say: 'At that time, everyone will have food to eat and enjoy blessings anyway, so why bother working hard now?' This time I went to the Soviet Union and saw clearly that blessings are definitely not enjoyed for nothing. It is absolutely impossible for anyone to eat without working." Li Shunda also said, "In the new society, loafers can't get by anywhere! The collective farm stipulates a minimum amount of labor for each member with the ability to work (from 100 to 150 labor days, depending on the specific situation, with exceptions for illness, disability, and women giving birth). If someone earns fewer labor days than the stipulated minimum for the whole year, they will be given different punishments according to the specific situation. Minor offenses will result in the deduction of labor days, and major offenses will result in expulsion (approved by the general meeting of all members); if it is deliberate sabotage of labor discipline, forced labor will be implemented (40 percent of the labor income goes to the state, and 60 percent goes to the individual). However, Soviet collective farmers are all actively working. We visited many farms and did not find anyone who failed to meet the stipulated minimum labor amount in a year. Many members' labor exceeds the stipulated minimum labor amount many times over. They don't have a trace of egalitarianism and are all actively striving towards the goal of becoming labor heroes. They don't need to buy land, they don't need to speculate, and they don't have to worry about being old or sick with no recourse. Everyone is wholeheartedly working hard, getting remuneration to improve their lives and raise their cultural level. No one will say anything bad about the happiest people, because that is earned through their labor, which is the greatest glory." Lu Hongbin, a model agricultural worker from Shandong Province, said, "The collective farm's labor day closely integrates the personal interests of the members with the public interests of the collective farm. Every member sees that the public economy of the collective farm has developed, and the individual's welfare has also increased. Therefore, everyone closely cares about the public economy of the collective farm. In the collective farms I visited, the value of the labor day is increasing year by year. For example, in the Molotov Collective Farm in the Georgian Republic, each labor day was worth only 7 rubles and 47 kopecks in 1946 (one ruble equals 100 kopecks), increased to 25 rubles in 1947, increased again to 26 rubles and 77 kopecks in 1948, and reached 39 rubles in 1951."
    In addition to participating in collective labor, members of the collective farm can also engage in individual sideline occupations. The collective farm allows each household to use 0.25 hectares to 0.5 hectares or even 1 hectare of land beside their houses without remuneration (depending on the amount of land, fertility, and historical conditions of the local area). On this plot of land, members can grow various crops and raise a certain number of livestock and an unlimited number of poultry. Wu Fengqi said, "I visited Kleko, a member of the Khrushchev Collective Farm in the Poltava District of Poltava Oblast in the Ukrainian Republic. He has 0.25 hectares of land beside his house, planted with more than 40 fruit trees, raising a dairy cow, two pigs, and a flock of chickens. These sideline occupations, in addition to providing for his family's consumption, also add about 1,200 rubles to his income each year." However, this individual economy only occupies a supplementary position for the entire needs of the members. Only the public economy of the collective farm is the foundation for improving the material level and affluent life of the members. With the steady rise of the public economy of the collective farm, the supplementary nature of the individual economy becomes smaller and smaller. When the public economy of the collective farm develops to the point where it can fully meet all the needs of the members, the members will no longer want their own land beside their houses. Lu Hongbin said, "In the Beria Collective Farm in the Makharadze District of the Georgian Republic, 70 households voluntarily requested to cancel their land beside their houses last year." How are Cadres Leading Production Remunerated?
    Some rural cadres in our country worry: When we get to socialism and are remunerated according to labor, we are in the office all day and cannot labor properly. How will we manage? At least we can't live as well as others! Some leaders of agricultural production cooperatives also think: We have to lead production and also participate in field labor. Now we are just leading the cooperative, and it already feels tiring enough, and it is not easy to run the cooperative well. In the future, if we establish a large collective farm and I am elected as chairman, then it will be even more impossible. After visiting the Soviet Union, they learned that after the collective farm was established, the organization and leadership work of production became more complicated, and the farm chairman concentrated on mental labor and no longer engaged in physical labor. The farm chairman's labor days are determined based on the farm's cultivated area, number of livestock, number of poultry, and total income. The percentage by which the farm's total income exceeds the plan is the percentage by which the chairman's salary increases (the maximum cannot exceed the full year's salary). In addition, if the farm's total cash income is more than one million rubles, the farm chairman can also receive a cash remuneration of 400 rubles per month. The farm chairman's salary increases with seniority; after being chairman for three years, it increases by 5 percent, from four to five years it increases by 10 percent, and after five years it increases by 15 percent, after which it no longer increases. The field work team leader and the livestock farm manager are also detached from production, and their work remuneration is also determined based on the area of cultivated land, the number of livestock, and the quantity of products under their jurisdiction. Production group leaders are not detached from production and labor like ordinary members; in addition to their own labor income, they can also receive labor days equal to 2 percent of the total number of labor days done by the whole group in a year (which is issued from the farm's total income, not deducted from the labor days of the group members). The agronomist, livestock expert, veterinarian, and accountant in the farm, if they are members of the farm, their work remuneration is generally equal to 75 to 80 percent of the farm chairman's; when the farm overfulfills the task, they are also given material rewards, but no additional labor days are calculated. If these people are hired from outside the farm, a separate contract is signed to stipulate the remuneration. The chairman, team leader, and agronomist are very important in the farm, and their work is closely related to the production of the whole farm. Their work remuneration is more than that of ordinary members. Lu Hongbin said, "In the mountainous Molotov Collective Farm in Georgia, each labor force can get an average of 260 labor days per year. The farm chairman's fixed remuneration is 66 labor days per month, plus a cash of 400 rubles. Last year, because the farm overfulfilled the task, the chairman also earned an additional 19 labor days per month." Many directors of agricultural production cooperatives and labor models said: Seeing the work and remuneration of the Soviet farm chairman, our original concerns have been dispelled. We must lead everyone forward well, learn skills well, and as long as it meets the needs of the country and the masses, we will have a bright future.

    社会主义和平均主义是不相容的
    陈大可
    在我们的农村里，有人说：“集体农庄里不分你我，你的就是我的，我的也是你的。”“到了共产主义社会，就可以爱干就干，爱吃就吃，需要什么东西就随便拿。”“集体农庄吃大锅饭，穿一样衣服。”这就把社会主义和共产主义误解为平均主义了。中国农民代表参观团的团员们访问苏联期间，亲眼看见了集体农庄的真实面貌，认识了幸福的生活和劳动不可分，认识了社会主义不是平均主义。河南省农业劳动模范赵怀义说：“过去，坏分子造谣说，集体农庄共产共妻，我曾半信半疑。有人问我，农业集体化了，庄稼还做不做？我也答不上来。说真的，过去我自己对农业集体化也有很多顾虑。这回看到苏联集体农庄农民的生活，才知道完全不是那么一回事。他们实行多劳多得的办法，分工和计工再没有那么科学，那么公平合理了。这一下，我心里的疙瘩完全解开了。”河南省农业劳动模范刘体重说：“以前听说‘苏联农民每人每天都能吃四两肉’，可就不知道这肉是从那里来的。现在才知道，这肉不是从天上掉下来的，也不是政府给发的，是自己劳动得来的。”
    计算“劳动日”的办法真是好
    集体农庄的“按劳取酬”，到底是怎么一回事呢？苏联积累多年的经验，创造了一整套非常科学的办法。为了分配得公平合理，他们采取了计件工资制。每天应该种多少地、犁多少地，每公顷土地应当收多少粮食，都是根据国家的指示，由区苏维埃和农庄按照实际情况订定，经庄员大会讨论通过的。国家计划生产数字分配到农庄以后，农庄就向各工作队分配，工作队再向生产小组分配，小组再分配给每个人。每个队、组、人都有固定的地段，（指中耕作物而言，麦类作物只分到队，不固定小组和个人）。不到一定年限不变动（到一定年限经过民主讨论可以变动）。一个地段要用多少劳动日、做多少活算一个劳动日，都是规定好了的。规定二十个劳动日完成的工作，如果十天完成了，还算二十个劳动日。应收一万斤粮食的土地，如果收了一万二千斤，除了多算劳动日以外，还要奖给超过任务的那一部分实物的百分之二十五。平原省农业劳动模范张学修说：“我们去年才建立农业生产合作社，怎么分工，怎么评工，一直没有好办法。这次到苏联，把办法学到了。有一个集体农庄，规定每公顷地用十个劳动日，一年收三十公担小麦；有的队一公顷收了四十五公担，就给另加五个劳动日，还抽出超过的那十五公担的百分之二十五奖给这个工作队。工作队按各组做的多少分配下去，各组再按每个人做的多少，分配给每个人。同样的雨水、同样的地，如果有些队、组、人的生产量不够标准，就要扣劳动日。如果全农庄的耕地都遭了天灾，全庄都要降低标准。可是产量多的还是要奖，产量少的还是要扣劳动日。”
    松江省农业劳动模范邓国章说：“这个办法可好哩。今春我们村里（松江省勃利县九区抢垦村）成立农业生产合作社，实行按社员耗费的劳动天数计算工资的办法。这种按天计工的办法，使勤快的人和懒惰的人没有分别。全省农业劳动模范开会时，大家讨论过怎样记工评分才能公平合理；虽然讨论了个办法，可是没有标准定额，没有固定分工，评工的时候谁也想给自己多评一点，结果还是不能真正合理；地里的活也时常发生无人负责现象，质量不好。春天我们买了五十只羊、五口猪，找了一个老年人管着。该怎么给他计工，大家都没主意。这回参观了坡尔塔瓦州坡尔塔瓦区赫鲁舍切夫集体农庄，可把这个问题解决了。他们实行的办法又精细又合理。女庄员拉娃娜是一个劳动英雄，去年她管着十口母猪，计划在一年内下一百五十口小猪。按规定，每下一口小猪得三个劳动日。结果她的母猪下了一百九十口小猪，她就得到五百七十个劳动日。她的小猪比计划多了四十口，按规定，每多养五口就奖给一口，她又得到八口小猪的奖励。按规定，每口小猪在最初两个月内长到十二公斤，算四个劳动日（小猪长到两个月后，就交给养肉猪的去养，每长十公斤算一个劳动日）。她的小猪都养得很好，一年又得到一百九十个劳动日。有了这样的好办法，谁干起活来还能不起劲呢？这真是我们从苏联带回来的最好的宝贝！”李顺达说：“人家把养鸡养鸭算劳动日的方法都规定好了。养一千只鸡过一天算一个劳动日，每生五百个鸡蛋又算一个劳动日；养五百只鸭过一天算一个劳动日，每生一百五十个鸭蛋又算一个劳动日；养一百五十只鹅过一天算一个劳动日，每生二十五个鹅蛋又算一个劳动日。要想让鸡鸭鹅多下蛋，就得想办法把它们养好。这办法最能鼓励劳动了。”辽东省农业劳动模范吴凤歧说：“苏联把集体农庄的各种工作统一规定成九级。担任第一级工作一天能完成标准定额（标准定额根据当地情况由农庄自己确定）的就算半个劳动日；每高一级加四分之一个劳动日，第四级算一个劳动日，第七级算两个劳动日。那种工作算那一级，都印在本子上，无论那种工作，算劳动日时，一查本子就知道了，真方便。这样做，劳动报酬就没有一点不合理了。我们一九四八年才组织互助组时，大家嫌麻烦，不记工也不算账，结果大家意见很多，互助组不巩固。一九四九年开始记工了，可是不评工。有人干得特别好也只算一个工，生产好手就不满意。后来评工了，因为没有定额，乱评一气，评得还是不合理。”参观团的团员们都感到苏联集体农庄实行定额定质、分工负责的办法好。虽然我们目前还不可能做到那么细致，但是那些办法的基本原则，马上就能在生产合作社里运用。把平均主义思想彻底粉碎了
    苏联集体农庄计算劳动报酬的办法，把许多人的平均主义思想彻底打破了。苏北农业劳动模范赵甫亚说：“我们那里二流子等‘社会主义’，有些中农怕‘社会主义’，他们都是拿平均主义的眼光看社会主义。有人说：‘到那时候反正人人有饭吃、有福享，现在何必下死力干活’这次我到苏联可看明白了，福决不是白享的，谁要想不劳动就吃饭，那是绝不可能的。”李顺达也说：“在新社会，懒汉是到哪儿也吃不开的！集体农庄给每个有劳动能力的庄员规定了最低的劳动额（从一百到一百五十个劳动日，看具体情况而定，生病、残废和妇女生孩子例外）。如果有人全年得到的劳动日比规定的最低劳动额还少，就要根据具体情况，给以不同的处分。轻的扣劳动日，重的开除（经全体庄员大会通过）；如果是故意破坏劳动纪律，就要实行强迫劳动（劳动的收入百分之四十归国家，百分之六十归他本人）。不过，苏联的集体农民没有不积极劳动的。我们访问了许多农庄，就没有发现一个在一年内作不到规定的最低劳动额的。许多庄员的劳动，都超过规定的最低劳动额的许多倍。他们没有一点点平均主义思想，都是积极地向劳动英雄的目标奋斗。他们既不要买地，又不要投机取巧，又不发愁老了病了没办法，大家都是一心一意好好劳动，得了报酬就改善生活，提高文化。对于生活最幸福的人，谁也不会说怪话，因为那是人家劳动得来的，那是最大的光荣。”山东省农业劳动模范吕鸿宾说：“集体农庄的劳动日使庄员的个人利益和集体农庄的公共利益紧密地结合起来了。每个庄员都看到，集体农庄公有经济发展了，个人的福利就也增加了。因此，每一个人都密切地关心着集体农庄的公有经济。在我所访问的集体农庄里，劳动日的比值都是一年比一年增长着。比如，格鲁吉亚共和国莫洛托夫集体农庄，每个劳动日在一九四六年只合七卢布四十七戈比（一卢布等于一百个戈比），一九四七年增加到二十五卢布，一九四八年又增加到二十六卢布七十七戈比，一九五一年达到了三十九卢布。”
    集体农庄的庄员除了参加集体劳动外，还可经营个人的副业。集体农庄容许每个农户无报酬地使用○·二五公顷到○·五公顷甚至一公顷的宅旁园地（看当地土地多少、肥瘦和历史情况而定）。在这块园地上，庄员可以种植各种农作物，并可豢养一定数量的牲畜和无限量的家禽。吴凤岐说：“我访问了乌克兰共和国坡尔塔瓦州坡尔塔瓦区赫鲁舍切夫集体农庄庄员克列科，他有○·二五公顷宅旁园地，种着四十多棵果树，养着一条奶牛、两口猪和一群小鸡。这些副业，除供他全家食用外，每年还给他增加约一千二百卢布的收入。”不过，这种个人经济对于庄员的整个需要，只占补助的地位。只有集体农庄的公有经济，才是提高庄员物质水平和富裕生活的基础。随着集体农庄公有经济的稳步上升，个人经济的补助性质就越来越小了。到了集体农庄公有经济发展到能够充分满足庄员的一切需要的时候，庄员就不愿再要自己的宅旁园地了。吕鸿宾说：“在格鲁吉亚共和国马哈拉兹区贝利亚集体农庄，去年就有七十个农户自动提出取消自己的宅旁园地。”领导生产的干部怎样取酬
    我国有些农村干部担心：到了社会主义，要按劳取酬，我们整天办公，不能好好劳动，怎么办呀？至少也不能像别人过得那么美吧！有的农业生产合作社的领导人也想：既要领导生产，又要参加田间劳动，现在还只是领导合作社，就已经觉得够累了，而且还不容易把合作社办好。将来办成大集体农庄，自己要是被选为主席，那更没办法了。他们到苏联参观以后，知道成立了集体农庄，生产的组织领导工作复杂了，农庄主席专心从事脑力劳动，不再从事体力劳动了。农庄主席的劳动日，是根据农庄的耕地面积、牲畜头数、家禽数目和总收入多少来确定的。全农庄的总收入超过计划百分之几，主席的工资也就增加百分之几（最多不能超过全年工资数）。此外，全农庄现金收入在一百万卢布以上的，农庄主席每月还可以得到四百卢布的现金报酬。农庄主席的工资随着工龄的增加而增加；做了三年主席，就加百分之五，四年到五年加百分之十，五年以上加百分之十五，以后就不再增加了。田间工作队队长、畜牧场场长也是脱离生产的，他们的工作报酬也是根据所管辖的耕地面积、牲畜数量、产品数量来确定的。生产小组长都不脱离生产，和一般庄员一样劳动；他们除了自己的劳动所得之外，还可得到等于全组一年所做的劳动日数的百分之二的劳动日（是由全农庄的总收入中发给的，不是从本组组员的劳动日中扣出来的）。农庄里的农学家、畜牧专家、兽医、会计师如果是本农庄的庄员，工作报酬一般等于农庄主席的百分之七十五到八十；全农庄超额完成任务时，也给他们实物奖励，但不再加算劳动日。如果这些人是从本农庄以外聘请来的，就另订合同，规定报酬。主席、队长和农学家等在农庄中是非常重要的，他们的工作好坏，对于全农庄的生产有密切关系。他们的工作报酬要比普通庄员多。吕鸿宾说：“格鲁吉亚山地的莫洛托夫集体农庄，每个劳动力平均每年能得到二百六十个劳动日。农庄主席的固定报酬是每月六十六个劳动日，另有现金四百卢布。去年因为农庄超额完成任务，主席每月还多得了十九个劳动日。”很多农业生产合作社主任和劳动模范都说：看到苏联农庄主席的工作和得到的报酬，我们原来的顾虑就打消了。我们要好好领导大家往前走，好好学本领，只要合乎国家和群众的需要，自己也就有远大的前途。
