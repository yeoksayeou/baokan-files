Three Years of People's Supervision Work
Director of the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, Tan Pingshan

The new China has been established for three years. Under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, our people's governments at all levels, through the arduous struggle of cadres at all levels and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, have achieved brilliant and great victories in the Resist America, Aid Korea, Land Reform, Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, Ideological Remolding, "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and Increase Production and Practice Economy movements. We have consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, achieved a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, and laid a good foundation for our country's upcoming large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. However, due to the complexity and arduousness of the work tasks, the lack of experience of some leaders, and the fact that some state functionaries have not yet thoroughly reformed their original old ideas and old work styles, and some have been eroded by the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie after entering the city, serious phenomena of violations of law and discipline, corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have occurred, causing a certain degree of damage to the interests of the state and the people.

Article 19 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that the functions and powers of the people's supervision organs at all levels are: "People's supervision organs shall be established within the people's governments at all levels above the county and city levels to supervise whether the state organs at all levels and various public officials are performing their duties, and to correct the illegal and derelict organs and personnel among them. The people and people's organizations have the right to accuse any state organ and any public official of illegal or derelict behavior to the people's supervision organs or the people's judicial organs." At the same time, Article 18 of the Common Program also pointed out: "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must strictly implement the revolutionary work style of being clean, simple, and serving the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses of the people." In the past three years, the people's supervision organs at all levels, in accordance with the above provisions, mobilized the masses and carried out supervision and inspection work, and continuously carried out serious struggles against all illegal and undisciplined, corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic phenomena. In total, more than 30,000 cases reported by the masses have been handled in the past three years, and the relevant business departments have been organized, promoted, and cooperated with to focus on the work in various fields such as industry and mining, transportation, finance and economics, trade, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, production and disaster relief, land reform, implementation of the Marriage Law, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and justice. Regular inspections were carried out. Those who were found to be in violation of the law or dereliction of duty during the inspection work or in the reported cases were criticized or dealt with separately in accordance with the principle of "combining education and transformation with disciplinary sanctions." In addition to a small number of personnel who violated the law or dereliction of duty with minor circumstances being exempted from punishment and a small number of personnel who seriously violated the law or dereliction of duty being expelled or criminally punished, another group of personnel who violated the law or dereliction of duty with more serious but different degrees were given different punishments ranging from warnings to removal from office; For the cases that have been inspected and dealt with, in general, after the handling, suggestions for improving work were put forward, recommending relevant departments to implement them, and notifying the experience and lessons to warn against the occurrence of similar events. This series of work has played a considerable role in reducing accidents, improving leadership, educating cadres, improving work efficiency, maintaining discipline, and safeguarding the interests of the state and the people.

However, due to the deep-rooted filth left over from the old society, and due to the rampant attacks of illegal capitalists on the people's democratic regime, although the people's supervision organs at all levels have made great efforts to correct or punish violations of law and discipline and bad phenomena, this bad atmosphere has not been fundamentally eliminated, and the phenomena of corruption and waste and the style of bureaucracy still exist seriously, and even spread and grow. Therefore, starting from December 1951, under the call and direct leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country launched a warm, extensive, large-scale, and vigorous great mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The task of this movement is closely related to the responsibilities of the people's supervision organs, so the people's supervision organs at all levels have devoted themselves to this movement. Now the "Three-Anti" movement has come to a victorious conclusion. Corruption, waste, and bureaucratic elements have been thoroughly exposed, reported, and even disciplined and legally punished, and all illegal acts of illegal capitalists have also been duly punished; educated all state functionaries and the broad masses of the people, recognized the harm of corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence in the business community to the country and the people, thereby, improved vigilance, strengthened the concept of cherishing state and people's property and attaching importance to the financial system and discipline, and changed the bad social atmosphere; Closely linked the government with the people, made the masses of the people convinced that "the people's government will not be corrupted," and realized that "Chairman Mao only allows good deeds, not bad deeds, and following Chairman Mao will never go wrong," further improved the prestige of the people's government, and played an important role in maintaining state property and ensuring the implementation of policies, laws, plans, and systems. Laid a solid foundation for carrying out supervision work in the future. The achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement are mainly due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government and the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses of the people, and the people's supervision system of the new democratic country has also played a certain role.

In the past three years of supervision work, especially in the "Three-Anti" movement, we have deeply realized the superiority of the people's supervision system in the new democratic country. We have the following three points of understanding of the superiority of this system:

First, we have adhered to the people's stand and the point of view of serving the people. No matter what state functionary, as long as he has made mistakes in his work, causing damage to the interests of the state and the people, the people's supervision organs will resolutely fight against him in the spirit of impartiality and selflessness, until he recognizes his mistakes and corrects them.

Second, we have adhered to the mass line of supervision work. The basic method of people's supervision work is to mobilize the masses of the people and rely on the masses of the people to supervise state organs and their public officials. In the past three years, especially in the "Three-Anti" movement, in order to implement the mass line, the people's supervision organs at all levels have widely developed people's supervision correspondents, set up people's complaint reception rooms and suggestion boxes, conscientiously and responsibly handled mass complaints, checked and handled cases in accordance with the principle of combining leadership and the masses, and carried out joint inspections with relevant departments and mass organizations. There have been great gains in work. It is precisely because we have been in contact with the masses, relied on the masses, and passed through the masses, that we have improved the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses in supervising the government, and played the supervisory role of the masses, so that we have been able to discover problems in time and solve problems correctly.

Third, we have adhered to the principle of combining supervision and correction with improving work, and combining education and transformation with disciplinary sanctions. The purpose of our supervision is to improve the policy level and professional level of state functionaries, and to learn from experience and improve work. Therefore, after inspecting and handling cases, most of them put forward positive suggestions and suggested that relevant departments implement them, opposing the practice of simply punishing and simply blaming. When punishing those who have made mistakes, we help them recognize their mistakes and correct them in the spirit of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing diseases to save people." Those who make mistakes due to lack of experience or difficult objective conditions are focused on education; those who knowingly commit crimes and are of bad character are severely punished. Oppose the practice of not distinguishing between right and wrong, and not being clear about rewards and punishments.

Although the people's supervision organs have achieved many achievements in the past, our current work still cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the national situation. In the future, cadres of the people's supervision organs at all levels should strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, sum up experience, improve their policy and professional level, and further improve the supervision organs, expand the organization of people's supervision correspondents, and more widely mobilize the masses of the people to supervise the people's government organs and all state functionaries, in order to meet the glorious and great historical tasks of the upcoming large-scale national economic construction and cultural construction.

    三年来的人民监察工作
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会主任  谭平山
    新中国的建立已经三周年了。我们各级人民政府在毛主席的英明正确领导下，通过各级干部的艰苦奋斗和广大人民的热烈支持，取得了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、思想改造、“三反”、“五反”、增产节约等运动的辉煌伟大的胜利，巩固了人民民主专政，实现了财政经济情况的根本好转，为我国行将到来的大规模经济建设、文化建设打下了良好的基础。但是由于工作任务复杂繁重，一部分领导者经验缺乏，以及一部分国家工作人员中，有的原来旧思想旧作风还没有加以彻底改造，有的在入城之后受到资产阶级腐朽思想的侵蚀，以致发生违法乱纪、贪污、浪费与官僚主义的严重现象，给国家与人民的利益造成了一定程度的损失。
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十九条规定了各级人民监察机关的职权是：“在县市以上的各级人民政府内，设人民监察机关，以监督各级国家机关和各种公务人员是否履行其职责，并纠举其中之违法失职的机关和人员。人民和人民团体有权向人民监察机关或人民司法机关控告任何国家机关和任何公务人员的违法失职行为。”同时，共同纲领第十八条还指出：“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”三年来，各级人民监察机关根据了上述的规定，发动了群众，开展了监督检查工作，对于一切违法乱纪、贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象，不断地进行了严肃的斗争。总计三年来，共处理了群众纠举的案件三万余起，并组织、推动与配合各有关业务部门，对工矿、交通、财经、贸易、农林、水利、生产救灾、土地改革、贯彻婚姻法、镇压反革命、司法等各方面的工作，有重点地进行了平时检查。对于在检查工作或纠举案件中所发现的违法失职人员，都本着“教育改造与纪律制裁相结合”的方针，分别进行了批判或处理。除了一部分情节轻微的违法失职人员免予处分和少数严重违法失职人员予以开除或刑事治罪外，另一部分情节较重但又程度不同的违法失职人员受到警告至撤职的不同处分；对于检查处理的案件，一般的都在处理之后，提出了改进工作意见，建议有关部门实施，并将经验教训通报，以警惕类似事件的发生。这一系列的工作对减少事故，改善领导，教育干部，提高工作效率，维护纪律，维护国家人民利益，起了相当的保障作用。
    但是，由于旧社会所遗留下来的污毒太深，由于不法资本家对人民民主政权施行猖狂进攻，各级人民监察机关对于违法乱纪及不良现象虽曾大力纠正或予以制裁，这种恶劣风气并未根本消除，贪污、浪费现象和官僚主义的作风依然严重存在，甚至蔓延滋长。故从一九五一年十二月起，在毛主席号召和直接领导下，全国人民展开了一个热烈、广泛、大张旗鼓、雷厉风行的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大群众运动。这一运动的任务是和人民监察机关的职责紧密相联的，因此各级人民监察机关便全力投入了这一运动。现在“三反”运动已经胜利结束。贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子受到了彻底的揭发、检举、直至纪律、法律的制裁，所有不法资本家的违法行为也受到了应有的惩处；教育了全体国家工作人员和广大人民群众，认清了贪污、浪费、官僚主义和工商界中的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报等行为对于国家和人民的危害，因而，提高了警惕，加强了爱护国家人民财产、重视财政制度与纪律的观念，转变了社会不良风气；密切了政府与人民的联系，使人民群众确信“人民政府不会被腐蚀了”，并体会到“毛主席只准作好事，不准作坏事，跟着毛主席走绝不会错”，进一步提高了人民政府的威信，对维护国家财产，保证政策、法令、计划、制度贯彻执行起了重大作用，给今后开展监察工作奠定了坚实的基础。“三反”运动成绩之获得，主要的是毛主席、中央人民政府的正确领导和广大人民群众的热烈参加，而新民主主义国家的人民监察制度也发挥了一定的作用。
    在三年来的监察工作中，尤其是“三反”运动中，我们深深地认识到新民主主义国家的人民监察制度的优越性。这种制度的优越性，我们体会有下列三点：
    一、坚持了人民的立场和为人民服务的观点。不论任何国家工作人员，只要他在工作上犯了错误，致使国家人民利益受到损害，人民监察机关就本着公正无私的精神，坚决地和他进行斗争，直到使他认识错误、纠正了错误为止。
    二、坚持了监察工作的群众路线。人民监察工作的基本方法就是发动人民群众，依靠人民群众来监督国家机关及其公务人员。三年来，尤其在“三反”运动中，为了贯彻群众路线，各级人民监察机关广泛地发展人民监察通讯员，设置人民检举接待室和意见箱，认真负责地处理群众控告，依照领导与群众相结合的方针，检查处理案件，并与有关部门和群众团体组织联合检查，在工作上是有很大的收获的。正因为我们这样的联系群众，依靠群众，通过群众，所以才提高了群众监督政府的积极性与信心，发挥了群众性的监督作用，使我们有可能及时地发现问题和正确地解决问题。
    三、坚持了监督纠举与改进工作相结合、教育改造与纪律制裁相结合的方针。我们的监察目的是为了提高国家工作人员的政策水平与业务水平，并吸取经验，改进工作。因此，在检查处理案件之后，大都提出了积极性的意见，建议有关部门执行，反对单纯惩办单纯指责的作法。处分犯错误的人员时，是以“惩前毖后，治病救人”的精神，帮助其认识错误，改正错误。对于经验不足或因客观条件困难而犯错误者，则着重教育；对明知故犯、品质恶劣者，则从严惩处。反对是非不分、赏罚不明的作法。
    人民监察机关过去虽然收到了不少成绩，但是我们现在的工作还赶不上国家形势发展的需要，今后各级人民监察机关的干部还应加强学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，总结经验，提高政策业务水平，并进一步地健全监察机构，扩大人民监察通讯员的组织，更广泛地动员人民群众进行监督人民政府机关和一切国家工作人员，以迎接行将到来的大规模国家经济建设、文化建设的光荣伟大的历史任务。    （新华社）
