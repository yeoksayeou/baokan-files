    Rapid Development of Education in Poland
    Schools across Poland opened on September 1st. This year, the number of primary, secondary, and working people's schools nationwide will be nearly 25,000, with a total of more than 3.6 million students. Thanks to the Polish People's Government's vigorous development of education since liberation, in the 1950-1951 academic year, all children in Poland aged seven to fourteen were enrolled in school. This is unprecedented in Polish history. In the pre-war years, more than one million school-age children were unable to receive education due to their parents' poverty.
    In the coming academic year, the number of secondary school students will reach 185,000. The state pays special attention to and helps the children of workers and peasants to enroll in higher education. Therefore, the proportion of worker and peasant students in the first class of secondary schools accounts for 71 percent. In the coming year, the state will allocate 36 million zlotys in student aid. Last year, 84,000 students received state aid.
    Poland also pays special attention to specialized technical education. In the past year, basic technical training schools have trained 250,000 skilled workers and technicians, many of whom are women. The two-year preparatory classes for universities and specialized schools, which are about to open, are specially established for outstanding young workers. This year, the Polish youth organizations and trade union organizations will recommend 2,500 young workers who are actively engaged in production and enthusiastic about learning in factories, enterprises, and state farms to study in the preparatory classes.

    波兰教育事业迅速发展
    波兰全国学校已于九月一日开学。今年初等、中等和劳动人民的学校数目将近二万五千所，学生共达三百六十多万名。由于波兰人民政府在解放以来大力发展教育的结果，在一九五○年——一九五一年学年，波兰全国七岁到十四岁的儿童都已入学。这在波兰历史上是空前的。在战前的年代里，有一百多万学龄儿童由于父母生活贫困而不能获得求学的机会。
    在未来的学年中，中学生将达到十八万五千人。国家特别关怀并帮助工农子弟升学，因此，在中学第一班的学生中，工农学生的比例占到百分之七十一。今后一年中，国家拨付的助学金数目将达三千六百万兹罗提。去年获得国家助学金的学生有八万四千名。
    波兰对于专门的技术教育也特别注意。去年一年内，基本技术训练学校培养了二十五万名技工和技师。其中有许多是妇女。即将开学的大学和专科学校的二年制先修班，是专为优秀的青年工人设立的。今年，波兰青年组织和各工会组织将推选出二千五百名在工厂、企业与国营农场中积极生产、热心学习的青年工人进先修班学习。
