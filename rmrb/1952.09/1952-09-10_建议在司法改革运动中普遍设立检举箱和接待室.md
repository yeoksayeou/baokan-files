    Suggest Establishing Whistleblower Boxes and Reception Rooms Universally in the Judicial Reform Movement

    Editor: The judicial reform movement is being carried out throughout the country, which is a major event to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. I think one of the prerequisites for doing a good job in this movement is to mobilize the masses to boldly expose and report all the old legal views and illegal and undisciplined behaviors of judicial personnel. In order to facilitate the acceptance of mass exposures and reports, I suggest that the people's governments of large, medium and small cities and even districts and townships throughout the country universally set up complaint boxes or whistleblower boxes, and I suggest that the judicial organs and newspapers in major cities add reception rooms for the masses to strengthen the work of receiving the masses.

    建议在司法改革运动中普遍设立检举箱和接待室
    编辑同志：全国各地正在开展司法改革运动，这是进一步巩固人民民主专政的重大事件。我认为要作好这一运动的先决条件之一，是发动群众大胆地揭发和检举司法人员的一切旧法观点和违法乱纪行为。为了便于接受群众的揭发和检举，我建议全国各大、中、小城市以至区、乡人民政府普遍设立控告箱或检举箱，并建议各大城市的司法机关和报社为群众增设接待室，加强接待群众的工作。
