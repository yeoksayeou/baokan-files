    Ma Wanshui Group Sets New Record in Level Tunneling

    To the Editor: The Ma Wanshui tunneling group of the Longyan Iron Mine set a new record in level tunneling in August, advancing 156.026 meters in a month, an average of about 0.96 meters more per day than the previous month.

    The reasons for their achieving this new result are as follows: (1) The workers in the group have more skillfully mastered the "two slot-pulling, one blasting" method and applied it specifically to various types of rock. (2) Ma Wanshui also found tricks to improve the loading operation method. Their tunneling face has both rock and ore layers. In the past, they drilled holes twice, blasted twice, and loaded the cars twice for the rock and ore layers. Now, it has been changed to drilling holes once, blasting twice, that is, blasting the rock holes first (still laying iron plates before blasting as in the past). After blasting, the collapsed rock is leveled, and an iron plate is placed on it, and then the ore holes are blasted. After blasting, the ore is loaded first, and then the rock. This avoids mixing the rock and ore, which saves time and ensures quality. (3) With the help of leading cadres, they learned the advanced method of using air pressure to blow out blasting smoke from the Northeast No. 1 Copper Mine, and preliminary trials have shown that the smoke is cleared more smoothly than before.

### 马万水小组又创平巷掘进新纪录

    马万水小组又创平巷掘进新纪录
    编辑同志：龙烟铁矿马万水掘进小组，八月份又创平巷掘进月进一百五十六点零二六公尺的新纪录，较上月每日平均多掘进约零点九六公尺。
    他们获得这一新成绩的原因如下：（一）全组工友更熟练地掌握了“两次拉槽，一次放炮”法，并在各种不同的岩石上具体运用了它。（二）马万水又找出窍门，改进了装车的操作方法。他们掘进面有岩石又有矿层，过去是把岩石与矿层分两次打眼、两次放炮、两次装车的。现在改为一次打眼、两次放炮，即先放岩石眼的炮（仍按过去放炮前铺上铁板），放完炮后，即把崩下来的岩石扒平，上面铺上一块铁板后，再放矿石眼的炮，放完炮后，先装矿石，后装岩石。这样就可以避免岩石与矿石混合，因而既节省时间，又保证了质量。（三）他们在领导干部的帮助下，学习了国营东北第一铜矿利用风压吹炮烟的先进方法，初步试用结果，炮烟也比以前出得顺利了。 王清荫
