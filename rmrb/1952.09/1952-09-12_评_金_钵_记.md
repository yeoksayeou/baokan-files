    Review of "The Golden Bowl"
    Dai Bufan
    By Tian Han, published by Zhonghua Book Company in 1950

    Editor's Note: "The Legend of the White Snake" is one of the most popular and excellent folk tales in China. This play is often performed in various places, based on more than one script. "The Golden Bowl" is one of them. This script has shortcomings in the adaptation work. Comrade Dai Bufan analyzes and criticizes this script in this article. Before the publication of this article, Comrade Tian Han has made some revisions to "The Golden Bowl" and has changed the name back to "The Legend of the White Snake". It is currently being revised. The revised version will be published soon. This article involves principled issues of how to deal with operas based on folk tales, so it is published to draw the attention of opera workers and literary circles.

    After the publication of Comrade Tian Han's "The Golden Bowl," it received a certain degree of praise. Some people think it is "more successful" among the adaptations of the Legend of the White Snake [Note 1]; others think it "created a model for mythological dramas" [Note 2]. This year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, in Hangzhou, where the White Snake story originated, some troupes staged the Legend of the White Snake based on "The Golden Bowl."

    Do these situations prove that "The Golden Bowl" is indeed a "more successful" "model"? I don't think so.

    The White Snake story "...expresses the people's struggle against oppressors and their pursuit of an ideal life with rich imagination and beautiful images" (People's Daily editorial, May 7, 1951). For thousands of years, people have loved this myth because it expresses the kind human nature of loving freedom and pursuing happiness. These kind characters are made even more profound and educational through the heroic struggle of the people in the myth against feudal forces. However, for thousands of years, the ruling class has also allowed this story to circulate; of course, they attempted to use the golden bowl and the Leifeng Pagoda to "instruct" the world to show the "dignity" and "inviolability" of the ruling system.

    Because of this, the White Snake story has been consistently smeared by the ruling class. But gems are not afraid of mud. Today, the White Snake story circulating among the people can still reflect the people's strong will to pursue happiness, freedom, and anti-feudalism, and is basically healthy. The task of opera reform workers is how to dust off the mud on the gem and make it shine. However, "The Golden Bowl" not only failed to complete this task but also rudely damaged this gem.

    In general, the main shortcoming of "The Golden Bowl" lies in the distortion of the anti-feudal theme of the White Snake story. Therefore, it not only shows anti-historical tendencies but also, to some extent, promotes the fairy and Buddhist philosophies of the feudal ruling class. It lacks serious criticism of the villains, and the handling of the positive characters changes the original legend and distorts her original vivid image.

            ×　　　　　×　　　　　×

    In the earlier White Snake stories, such as "Bai Niangzi永镇雷峰塔 (Bai Niangzi Forever Suppressed in Leifeng Pagoda)" in "Jingshi Tongyan" and "雷峰怪迹 (Strange Traces of Leifeng)" in "West Lake Tales," the woman transformed from this lovely snake demon frantically pursues Xu Xian. Her motivation comes from innocent, pure, and simple love. Her actions embody the demands of thousands of young people in feudal society for free love and happy marriage. But this action disrupted the feudal ruling order of "matchmaker's words" and "no physical contact between men and women." This should be the real reason why the feudal representative, the monk Fahai, persecuted Bai Niangzi. If Bai Niangzi were really the daughter of a general, and her marriage was achieved through the orders of her parents and the words of a matchmaker, would Fahai dare to provoke trouble for no reason?

    The fierce struggle of flooding Jinshan Temple is a struggle between those who destroy the feudal order and those who maintain it. And the root of this struggle lies in Bai Suzhen's "wildness" - wanting free love.

    "The Golden Bowl" does not grasp the above-mentioned main contradiction at the beginning, but inherits the old plot, saying that Bai's departure from her teacher is due to "always thinking of Xu Lang's great kindness, and love arises from gratitude" - wanting to repay Xu Xian for saving her life thousands of years ago. In this way, it will relatively weaken the strong wildness of the typical Bai Suzhen who strives for free love. ("Jingshi Tongyan" portrays this woman's love as fiery.) Moreover, Bai's gratitude is approved by her master, so it is difficult to explain why Fahai has to persecute her marriage all the time. Because the root of this contradiction cannot be fully explained, no wonder the author not only asks Bai Suzhen to oppose feudalism later but also asks her to oppose the "Emperor" - the Japanese pirates! (This will be discussed later.)

    It is impossible to imagine that men and women in feudal society did not have the courage to fight for free love and must infuse "gratitude" to explain the depth and sincerity of Bai Suzhen's love [Note 3]. On the contrary, without the "predestined relationship" like "gratitude," it can highlight Bai Niangzi's pure love, showing that Bai Niangzi is a representative figure of ordinary youth in feudal society, instead of making people feel that "things are predestined."

    It is still necessary to look back at the old accounts of the Legend of the White Snake. The "White Clan Precious Scroll" [Note 4] sung by the nuns living on the ruling class is more deliberately rendering the story of Bai's repayment of gratitude than the folk artists' singing script "The Righteous Demon Biography" (ballad). The earlier Peking Opera "The Complete Leifeng Pagoda" [Note 5] does not have any plot of repayment of gratitude. Bai's descent from the mountain is just because she has long admired the scenery of West Lake and wants to come for a tour. The same is true in the Cantonese opera "Legend of the White Snake" [Note 6]. The Hunan folk "Pinghua" "Legend of the White Snake" [Note 7] only says that Xu and Bai met in West Lake, and there is no strange talk like "repayment of gratitude." This old account can show that the "Legend of the White Snake" close to the lower-level masses does not say anything about Bai's repayment of gratitude. This "repayment of gratitude" plot should be fabricated by the authors of the ruling class.

    The ruling class fabricated Bai's repayment of gratitude, in addition to deliberately playing mystery, there is actually a deep meaning. With the predestined relationship of repayment of gratitude, it can be used to reconcile the struggle - laying the groundwork for Bai's ascension to heaven. Moreover, there must be a cause for a result. After all, it will make both heaven and earth worry about suddenly letting a strange white snake go to heaven.

    I am not opposed to the saying that gratitude is a traditional virtue of the Chinese people, but using it in the Legend of the White Snake, first, it makes the audience unable to understand why Fahai wants to harm Bai Niangzi, second, it weakens Bai Niangzi's wildness, and third, it reduces Bai Niangzi's representativeness, which is really not an appropriate treatment.

    But the serious shortcomings of "The Golden Bowl" are more than that. It not only teaches Bai to repay gratitude but also arranges an old "teacher" for Bai Suzhen - the White Lotus Holy Mother. When Suzhen goes down the mountain, this holy mother, who is like a fairy, points out to her: "Meet the lake and combine, meet the sea and divide, don't mess with wine, don't fight with water." I am not opposed to appropriately arranging people who can know the past and the future in mythological dramas, but I do not agree that there is such a holy mother in the Legend of the White Snake. Because the holy mother said so, it will not only arouse the audience's Yin-Yang superstitious feelings but also, with the teacher's words first, then later messing with wine, fighting with water, flooding Jinshan, and being suppressed under the pagoda, it will all be Bai Suzhen's "self-inflicted" "deserved punishment"! - Who told Bai Suzhen not to listen to the holy mother's words?

    In this way, the White Snake story, which has serious anti-feudal educational significance, seems to have returned to the point where the nuns said "White Clan Precious Scroll"! The audience will probably only blame the White Snake, and the hatred for Fahai will be weakened completely.

    Although this is the result of the author of "The Golden Bowl" inheriting the old plot, the distortion of the struggle of the White Snake and Green Snake, and the tolerance of Fahai, the object of the struggle, are mainly because the author did not grasp the main contradictions in the Legend of the White Snake and analyze the reasons for it.

            ×　　　　　×　　　　×

    "The Golden Bowl" does not grasp the anti-feudal theme, and the handling of the characters is also scattered and blurred.

    First of all, in this adapted version of the White Snake story, there are two characters that are not easy to understand. One is the White Lotus Holy Mother mentioned above. When Suzhen is about to go down the mountain, the Holy Mother persuades her: "Suzhen, you are going astray. Do you know that things in the world are impermanent? If you are not careful, gratitude may turn into resentment, and love may turn into hatred. At that time, it will be too late for you to regret!" She can guide Suzhen to "cultivate the pure and quiet Dao," and she can also say these mysterious words. So, is this sanctimonious fellow a positive character? Or a villain? The second is the Antarctic Immortal (i.e., the popularly known Old Man of Longevity) in the "Stealing Grass" scene. After he reconciled the battle between the Crane and Deer children and Suzhen and gave her the fairy grass, he warned her: "After giving birth, quickly return to Mount Emei to cultivate the Great Dao. If you continue to indulge in infatuation, you will be trapped like a silkworm and unable to transcend. It will be too late for you to regret!" What kind of person is someone who says such things? Positive? Negative? The above-mentioned one woman and one man seem to be "middle-of-the-roaders" on the surface, but analyzing their words, we can see that they are actually villains who persuade Suzhen to give up the idea of pursuing happiness, so as to avoid fighting with Fahai. "The Golden Bowl" copies the old version without error for such people who are nominally neutral but in essence are no different from Fahai, lacking powerful criticism. It only makes the audience feel that "Bai Niangzi is not good herself" - not listening to the words of the gods, what a serious mistake this is!

    The author's critical stance towards Fahai, who was imprisoned in the crab shell by the people, is also treated from the perspective of a third party. He originally wanted to criticize Fahai's destruction of other people's happiness through the boatman in the tenth scene "Salvation." But we only hear Fahai talking about his "renunciation," "the happiness of purity and quietness," and "the foolish and stubborn men and women who are greedy for love"; and the boatman only says that Fahai "likes to meddle in other people's business"! Forcibly dismantling other people's happy marriage, and finally suppressing the woman under the pagoda, is Fahai's mistake caused by "liking to meddle in other people's business"? This unserious tone of criticism proves how crude the author is on the anti-feudal theme of the White Snake story!

    What is intolerable is that the author also distorted the character of Xiao Qing'er, one of the protagonists. Everyone knows that she is a person who resolutely does not compromise and resolutely wants to fight. However, she is seriously distorted in "The Golden Bowl." In the "Decoction" scene, Xiao Qing persuades Suzhen: "This time, after saving the official, you and I, master and servant, should withdraw as soon as possible, return to the deep mountains, and cultivate the Great Dao bitterly, and don't fall into the web of love again. ... (Omission) Maybe the master will 'repay kindness with enmity'"; "Passionate love is like fire, he will burn us"; "For the sake of a 'love' character, do you not cherish thousands of years of cultivation?"; Such words make Xiao Qing also become a "bitterly persuading" person like the White Lotus Holy Mother and the Antarctic Immortal, making Xiao Qing look like a moralist. Moreover, repaying gratitude, preventing "repaying kindness with enmity," and leaving is the best policy. Who can say that this is Xiao Qing's original character!

    It is precisely because the author has not clearly drawn a line between the oppressors and the oppressed that he cannot give the villains a powerful criticism. On the contrary, in some places, it seems to be preaching for the villains. For example, in the "Wine Transformation" - the Dragon Boat Festival scene, Fahai is allowed to point out to Xu Xian: "The red gauze tent is your sobering soup!" Although Bai's transformation into a snake is a mythological fact at this time, the actual effect of this "realistic" and aggressive language is nothing but the audience's feeling of fear and admiration for Fahai. - Is this the purpose of adapting the Legend of the White Snake?

    And what makes people feel the most mysterious and incomprehensible is the so-called "Great Dao" that I quoted above from the original text of "The Golden Bowl" and added emphasis to. Judging from what is quoted above, this "Great Dao" should be the way of the gods? It is incompatible with the idea of pursuing human freedom and happiness. However, inexplicably, at the end of the whole play, when Xiao Qing handles "demolishing the pagoda," Xiao Qing actually says: "... It is me who returned to the mountains to cultivate bitterly for hundreds of years. The Great Dao has been accomplished. I returned to Jiangnan to defeat Fahai. Today, I have come to West Lake to rescue my lady..." This is actually not the infinite wonderful use of the "Great Dao," but the author's subjective psychology of not disliking the "Great Dao." Therefore, floatingly, the "Great Dao" is used as a better thing that can replace human freedom and happiness, and it can also be used as a magical skill to rescue people under the pagoda. From here, we can further judge the author's intention: to rescue Bai Niangzi, it is still necessary to rely on this set of "Great Dao," or to rely on the power of gods and Buddhas, which shows the infinite power of immortals and Buddhas. But, don't forget that Fahai is the representative of "immortals and Buddhas," and Bai Niangzi is the one who repeatedly told Xu Xian not to interact with Fahai! Using the "Great Dao" to destroy the pagoda is not only against the legend [Note 8] but also tantamount to calling the ruling class to come out and mediate. - Is this the original intention of the "Legend of the White Snake"?

    Due to the ambiguity of the characters' personalities, the positive significance of the play's anti-feudalism is also blurred. Because the "Great Dao" is playing tricks in the author's mind, "The Golden Bowl" is even preaching for the gods. For example, the above-mentioned words of the White Lotus Holy Mother, "Gratitude sometimes turns into resentment," are originally caused by an unreasonable social system, but in the play, it seems that it really makes people feel "impermanent," promoting an erroneous worldview.

            ×　　　　　　×　　　　　×

    Let's take a look at the anti-historical tendencies of "The Golden Bowl":

    As mentioned earlier, because the author stubbornly adheres to the theory of repayment of gratitude, he cannot explain why Fahai wants to persecute Bai, which forces the author to find another contradiction to replace the original contradiction in the Legend of the White Snake. Moreover, the author seems to want to "give new meaning" to the White Snake story [Note 9], so he awkwardly inserts the invasion of Japanese pirates as the historical background of the White Snake story in the play.

    The adapter handled Xu Xian's family background as: "Where are Daddy and Mommy? They used to do business in Shanghai, but because the Japanese pirates invaded and the store was razed to the ground, Daddy and Mommy died of anger."

    He handled the "stealing silver" as: The Qiantang treasury silver stolen by Xiao Qing was sent by the traitor Wang Zhi to the county magistrate so that the county magistrate would act as an internal response on the day the Japanese soldiers attacked Hangzhou. After the matter was completed, another five hundred would be sent.

    He changed the original "spreading plague" to: "The monks headed by Fahai are internal agents colluding with the Japanese slaves. They released poison to harm the people, took the opportunity to spread rumors, falsely claiming that it was a disaster from heaven. And Bai Niangzi enthusiastically administered medicine to save the victims and exposed the conspiracy of the internal agent monks. Therefore, Fahai resented her and framed her..." [Note 10]

    Such an arrangement can indeed "reasonably and reasonably" explain why Fahai hates Bai Niangzi. However, it fundamentally negates the anti-feudal theme of the White Snake story. If the mythological White Snake story "can" be treated in this way, today, wouldn't it be even more "meaningful" to treat Bai Niangzi and Qing'er as "nurses" on the front line against germ warfare [Note 11]?

    But this is a crude treatment of mythology and an undesirable tendency of anti-historical materialism.

    Don't say that the Japanese pirates of the Ming Dynasty were different from the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, and they had never bought traitors to release poison. Don't say that Shanghai in the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty was not yet a commercial port. Don't say that where the Japanese pirates of the Ming Dynasty went, there was no one for thousands of miles, and Xu Xian and Bai Niangzi were not allowed to fall in love, get married, open a pharmacy, and practice medicine in Zhenjiang. Even if the historical facts are like this, such an insertion and distortion also destroys the complete anti-feudal theme of the original story.

    And don't forget that the White Snake story already had a prototype in the Song Dynasty [Note 12].

          ×　　　　　　　×　　　　　×

    The shortcomings of "The Golden Bowl" are more than the above. For example, it emphasizes coincidences and uses coincidences as the key to the development of the story. (In the old version, Xu Xian was exiled to Suzhou, and Bai Niangzi came to find him. But "The Golden Bowl" says that Xu Xian was exiled to Zhenjiang, and he just happened to meet Bai Niangzi and Qing'er when he went out for an outing. When Qing'er saw Xu Xian, she actually said: "Miss, no coincidence, no story. Isn't that the master coming over there?" It's like a storyteller's tone.) The place names in the play are also inconsistent with reality. (Hangzhou's alias is Wulin, mistakenly written as Wuling. After playing Lingyin, he should disembark at Yue Tomb, first go to Qiantang Gate, and then go to Qingbo Gate, but the play says that Qingbo Gate is closer than Qiantang Gate.) These can also be incidentally explained that the adapter is careless.

    The failure of the adaptation of "The Golden Bowl" is because the author did not absorb the essence of the old story well but retained many of its dross. It is because the author wanted to add some new things, but these new things are like sprinkling a handful of salt on braised pork, making the story lose its original deliciousness. However, the reason for these two failures is that the author used a petty-bourgeois stance to deal with this myth with a strong anti-feudal struggle. Therefore, he lost the ability to distinguish the toxins in the old opera, did not deeply understand the seriousness of the theme, and could not grasp the main contradictions in it, but attempted to replace the contradictions that should be expressed in the myth with another contradiction. As a result, in some occasions, the positive characters are villainized, and the villains are glorified. Not only is there no anti-feudal educational effect, but it also promotes the fairy tales of the feudal landlord class.

    The failure of the adaptation of "The Golden Bowl" should be a good lesson in opera reform. Without standing firm on the proletarian stance, without mastering the analytical and critical weapons of dialectics, and violating historical materialism, opera reform - and even all work - will be fruitless.

    Tian Han's "The Golden Bowl" was written during the Anti-Japanese War and performed in the Kuomintang reactionary rule area. There was no freedom of speech at that time. The author used a little space to scold the traitors, and the intention is still understandable; but after the liberation, publishing or staging this play without the author seriously revising it is an extremely unserious attitude.

    评“金　钵　记”
    戴不凡
    田汉作　中华书局一九五○年出版
    编者按：“白蛇传”是我国流行最广的优秀的民间传说之一。各地经常演出这个剧目，所根据的脚本不只一种，“金钵记”即其中之一。在改编工作上，这个剧本是有缺点的。戴不凡同志在本文中对这剧本进行了分析和批评。在本文发表以前，作者田汉同志已对“金钵记”作了一些修改，并已将剧名仍改为“白蛇传”，现正继续进行修改中。修改本不久可以出版。兹以本文涉及如何处理以民间传说为题材的戏曲的带有原则性的问题，所以发表出来，以引起戏曲工作者和文艺界的注意。
    田汉同志的“金钵记”问世后，受过一定程度的好评。有人认为它是白蛇传改编本中“较成功的”〔注一〕；有人认为它“为神话剧创设了一个典范”〔注二〕。今年端午节，在产生白蛇故事的杭州，一些剧团就是根据“金钵记”上演白蛇传的。
    这些情形是否就证明“金钵记”确是“较成功的”“典范”呢？我看，不是。
    白蛇故事，“……以丰富的想像和美丽的形象表现了人民对压迫者的反抗斗争与对于理想生活的追求”（人民日报一九五一年五月七日社论）。千百年来人民热爱这个神话，因为它表达了爱自由、追求幸福的善良人性；这些善良的性格，通过神话中人们对于封建势力的英勇斗争，而显得愈益深刻和富有教育意义。但，千百年来，统治阶级也准许这个故事流传；当然，他们是企图用金钵和雷峰塔来“垂训”世人，以表示统治制度的“尊严”与“不可侵犯”。
    正因为这样，所以白蛇故事一贯地被统治阶级所涂抹。但宝石毕竟是不怕泥污的，今天流传于人民口中的白蛇故事，仍能反映人民追求幸福、自由和反封建的强烈意志，基本上还是健康的。戏曲改革工作者的任务，是在于如何拂拭去蒙在宝石上的污泥，使她光彩夺目。然而“金钵记”不但没有完成这一任务，反而粗暴地损坏了这块宝石。
    总的说来，“金钵记”的主要缺点在于歪曲了白蛇故事的反封建主题。因而不仅表现了反历史主义倾向，而且在某种程度上宣扬了封建统治阶级的神仙佛理，对于反派人物缺乏严肃的批判，对于正派人物的处理，却更动了原来的传说，而歪曲了她原有的鲜明形象。
            ×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    在较早的白蛇故事，如“警世通言”的“白娘子永镇雷峰塔”、“西湖佳话”的“雷峰怪迹”中，这个可爱的蛇妖所化成的女人疯狂地追求许仙，她的动机是出于天真的、纯洁的、朴素的爱。她的行动体现了封建社会中千千万万青年对自由恋爱和幸福婚姻的要求。但这一行动就破坏了“媒妁之言”“授受不亲”一类的封建统治秩序。这应当是封建势力代表人法海和尚要迫害白娘子的真正原因。假如白娘子端的是总兵之女，而她的婚姻是通过父母之命、媒妁之言成就的，法海胆敢如此这般去无故寻衅吗？
    水漫金山这一场激烈的斗争，是破坏封建秩序者和维护封建秩序者的斗争。而这一斗争的根源，是在于白素贞“撒野”——要自由恋爱。
    “金钵记”一开场就没有掌握上述这一主要矛盾，却因袭了旧关目，说白氏的辞师下山是由于“常念许郎大恩，由恩生爱”。——想以身相报许仙数千年前的救命之恩。这么一来，就会比较削弱了争取自由恋爱者的典型白素贞的强烈野性。（“警世通言”表现这个女性的爱是烈火一般的。）而且，白氏报恩又是她师父批准了的，这样就很难解释法海为什么要始终迫害她的婚姻。因为不能完满解释这一矛盾的根源，怪不得作者在以后不但叫白素贞去反封建，还叫她去反“帝”——倭寇！（这留待下文再谈。）
    不可能想像，说封建社会中的男女没有争取自由恋爱的勇气，而必须渗入“报恩”，才能说明白素贞的爱情的深厚诚挚〔注三〕。相反，没有“报恩”之类的“前缘”，倒反能衬托出白娘子的纯洁爱情，表现出白娘子是封建社会中普遍青年的代表人物，而不致使人有“事有前定”之感。
    翻一翻白蛇传的旧账还是有必要的。寄生于统治阶级身上的尼姑所唱的“白氏宝卷”〔注四〕，对于白氏报恩之说，就比民间艺人说唱的底本“义妖传”（弹词），更着意渲染。较早的京戏“全本雷峰塔”〔注五〕并没有什么报恩的情节，白氏下山不过是久慕西湖风光，想来一游而已。广东戏中的“白蛇传”〔注六〕也是如此。湖南民间的“评话”“白蛇传”〔注七〕也只说是许、白两人在西湖邂逅，都没有“报恩”之类的怪话。这篇老账可说明，接近下层群众的“白蛇传”，全不说白氏报恩。这一“报恩”的情节该是统治阶级的作者所杜撰的。
    统治阶级捏造白氏报恩，除了故弄虚玄之外，实在也是有深意存在的。有了报恩这节前缘，那就可为调和斗争——白氏升天安下伏笔。而且，有果必有因，叫一条陌不相识的白蛇忽然上天，毕竟要使天上人间两耽忧的。
    我不反对报恩原是我国人民的传统美德之说，但引用在白蛇传中，一使观众搞不清楚法海要害白娘子的原因，二是减弱了白娘子的野性，三将缩小白娘子的代表性，实在并不是妥当的处理。
    但“金钵记”的严重缺点还不止此。它不但教白氏报恩，还安排了白素贞的一位老“师”——白莲圣母。素贞下山时，这位类乎神仙的圣母就指点她：“遇湖而合，遇海而分，遇酒莫乱，遇水莫争。”我不反对在神话剧中可以适当地安排能知过去未来之辈，可是，我不同意白蛇传中有这么一位圣母。因为圣母如此一说，不仅将引起观众的阴阳迷信感触，而且为师的有言在先，则以后遇酒而乱，遇水而斗，水漫金山，镇压塔下，那都将是白素贞“咎由自取”“罪有应得”了！——谁叫白素贞不听圣母的话呢？
    这样一来，具有严肃的反封建教育意义的白蛇故事，好像已经恢复到尼姑说“白氏宝卷”的地步！观众对白蛇恐怕只会有责备，对法海的仇恨会削弱得一干二净了。
    虽说这是“金钵记”的作者因袭旧关目的结果，但歪曲白蛇、青蛇的斗争性，宽容了被斗争的对象法海，主要的还是由于作者没有掌握白蛇传中的主要矛盾，并分析其原因所致。
            ×　　　　　×　　　　×
    “金钵记”没有掌握反封建的主题，对人物的处理也是零乱模糊的。
    首先，这个白蛇故事的改本中，有两个使人不易搞清楚的人物。其一是上面说过的白莲圣母。素贞要下山时，圣母劝她：“素贞，你这就误入歧途了。可知道世间之事，变动无常，稍一不慎，恩有时变成怨，爱有时变成仇，到那时节，你悔之晚矣！”她能指点素贞“修习清静大道”，又能说这套玄之又玄的话，那末，这个道貌岸然的家伙，她究竟是正派人物呢？还是反派人物呢？其次是“盗草”场中的南极仙翁（按，即俗传之寿星老头子）。他在调和了鹤鹿二童与素贞的战斗，并给她仙草后，就告诫她：“分娩之后，速回峨嵋，修习大道。若再贪恋痴情，必将如茧自缚，不得超脱，悔之晚矣！”说这样话的人，又是什么样的人呢？正派的？反派的？上述一女一男，表面很类乎“中间派”，可是，分析一下他俩的话，可知他们实际上都是劝素贞放弃追求幸福的思想，以免与法海斗争的反派人物。对于这样表面上中立而骨子里和法海一般无二的人，“金钵记”从旧本中照抄无误，缺乏有力的批判。使观众只会觉得“白娘子自己不好”——不听神仙的话，这是如何严重的错失！
    作者对被人民关在蟹壳里的法海，其批判的立场，也是用第三者的眼光来对待的。他原来想通过第十场“渡语”中的艄公，来批判法海的破坏他人幸福。但我们只听到法海大谈其“出家”“清静之福”“愚顽的众生男贪女爱”；而艄公只说法海“爱管闲事”！强迫拆散他人的幸福婚姻，最后还把女人镇压在塔下，法海的错误难道是“爱管闲事”造成的？这种不严肃的批判口吻，证明了作者在白蛇故事的反封建主题上，是如何粗率！
    不可容忍的，作者还歪曲了主角之一的小青儿的性格。谁都知道她是坚决不妥协，坚决要斗争的人物。然而在“金钵记”中却被严重歪曲了。“煎药”一场中，小青就劝素贞：“此番救活官人，你我主婢及早抽身，回转深山，苦修大道，不要再堕情网了。……（中略）说不定姑爷倒会‘恩将仇报’哩”；“痴情似火，他会烧坏咱们的”；“为着一个‘情’字，你不可惜千年的修炼吗”；诸如此类的话，使小青也成为白莲圣母、南极仙翁一类的“苦口婆心”者，使小青俨然成为一个道学先生。而且，报了恩，预防“恩将仇报”，走之大吉，谁能说这是小青的本来性格呢！
    正因为作者没有截然划清压迫者和被压迫者之间的界线，所以不能予反派人物以有力的批判，相反，有些地方倒好像在替反派人物说教。例如，“酒变”——端阳一场，竟容许法海指点许仙说：“红罗帐内就是你的醒酒汤！”虽然，这时白氏变蛇是神话中的事实，可是，这种“写实”的，咄咄逼人的话语，实际引起的效果不是其他，而是观众的恐惧感觉，以及对于法海的赞服。——难道这是改编白蛇传的目的吗？
    而最使人感到虚玄不可解的，是我在上面引述“金钵记”原文而加了着重点的所谓“大道”。照上面所引的看来，这种“大道”该即是神仙之道吧？它是和追求人间自由幸福的思想相水火的。可是，莫名其妙地，作者在全剧的终场，处理小青“倒塔”时，小青竟又说：“……是我回转山上苦修数百年，大道已成，回转江南战胜法海，今日特到西湖打救娘子。……”这其实并不是“大道”之妙用无穷，而是作者主观上对“大道”存在着并不厌恶的心理。所以，飘飘忽忽地，既把“大道”用作为可代替人间自由、幸福的更好的东西，又可以用作为解救塔下人的奇术。从这里进一步可以判断作者的意图：解救白娘子的还是要靠这一套“大道”，还是有赖于神力佛法之类，足见仙佛力量之无穷无边。可是，别忘了，法海正是“仙佛”的代表，白娘子是再三叮嘱许仙别和法海往来的人物！用“大道”去毁塔，不仅是违反传说〔注八〕，而且也就无异叫统治阶级出来转圜。——难道这是“白蛇传”原来的意愿？
    由于人物性格的模糊，也就混淆了本剧反封建的积极意义。由于“大道”在作者思想上作怪，更使“金钵记”在替神仙说教。例如上举白莲圣母之言，“恩有时变成怨”，原是不合理的社会制度造成的，但在剧中，却好像真的要使人觉得“变动无常”，宣扬错误的世界观了。

    这里再来看一看“金钵记”的反历史主义倾向：
    如前所说，因为作者固执了报恩之说，无法解说法海要迫害白氏的原因，这就迫使作者不得不另外找一个矛盾，来代替白蛇传中的原有矛盾。而且，作者似乎也想在白蛇故事中“赋予了新义”〔注九〕，所以，在剧中生硬地插入倭寇侵略来作为白蛇故事的时代背景。
    改编者把许仙的家世处理为：“爹爹妈妈吗？原在上海经商，只因倭寇侵凌，店子夷为平地，爹娘一气就双双亡故了。”
    他把“盗银”处理成：小青所盗的钱塘库银，是汉奸汪直送给县官的。要县官在倭兵攻杭之日，作一内应，事成之后，再送五百。
    他把原来的“散瘟”改为：“以法海为首的和尚们，是勾结倭奴的内奸，他们放毒害民，乘机造谣，伪称是上天降灾。而白娘子热心施药拯救灾民，揭穿内奸和尚的阴谋，因此，法海怀恨她，陷害她，……”〔注十〕
    这样的安排，的确是“合情合理”地可以说明法海为什么仇恨白娘子。可是，它却根本否定了白蛇故事的反封建主题。如果“可以”如此这般的来对待神话白蛇故事，在今天，把白娘子和青儿处理成反细菌战前线的“护士”〔注十一〕，那不是更有“新义”吗？
    但，这是一种粗暴地对待神话的，反历史唯物主义的不良倾向。
    别说明代的倭寇不同于抗战时的日寇，没有买过汉奸放毒，别说明代嘉靖年间上海还不是一个商埠，别说明代倭寇所至，千里无人，不容许仙和白娘子恋爱结婚和到镇江开药店行医，即使史实如此，这样的穿插和歪曲，也是破坏原故事的反封建的完整主题的。
    而且别忘记，白蛇故事在宋代就已有雏型了〔注十二〕。

    “金钵记”的缺点还不止上述，例如，它强调巧合，以巧合作为故事发展的关键。（旧本中，许仙发配苏州，是白娘子赶来寻到的。而“金钵记”却说许仙发配镇江，出外郊游，刚巧遇到白娘子与青儿。当青儿看见许仙时，居然说：“姑娘，无巧不成书，那边来的可不就是姑爷吗？”俨然说书人口吻。）剧中的地名和实际也不相符。（杭州别名武林，误为武陵。玩灵隐回来，应在岳坟下船，先到钱塘门，后到清波门，但剧中却说清波门比钱塘门近。）这些，也可以附带说明改编者的漫不经心。
    “金钵记”改编的失败，是因为作者对旧的故事，没有很好吸取其中的精华，却保留了其中不少的糟粕；是因为作者想加入一些新的东西，但这些新的东西却如在红烧肉上再撒一把盐，使故事变了原来的美味。可是，造成这两个失败原因的，那还是由于作者是以小资产阶级的立场，来处理这个反封建斗争性很强的神话，因此，对旧戏中的毒素丧失鉴别力，对主题的严肃性体会不深，不能掌握其中的主要矛盾，却企图以另一矛盾来替代神话中原应表现的矛盾。于是，在有些场合中，正派人物反派化，反派人物正派化，不仅收不到反封建的教育效果，反而宣扬了封建地主阶级的神仙之谈。
    “金钵记”改编的失败，应当是戏曲改革工作中的一个好教训。不站稳无产阶级立场，不好好掌握辩证法的分析批判武器，以及违反历史唯物主义，戏曲改革——以至于一切工作，都将一事无成。
    田汉的“金钵记”是编于抗日战争时期，在国民党反动统治地区演出的，当时没有言论自由，作者利用一点空隙骂骂汉奸，用心还是可以理解的；但在解放后出版或上演此剧，作者没有认真的修改，就是极不严肃的态度了。
