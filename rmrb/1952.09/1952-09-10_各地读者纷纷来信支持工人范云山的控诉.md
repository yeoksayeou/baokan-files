Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    After the "Reader's Letters" page on August 23 published worker Fan Yunshan's letter accusing "Changping County People's Court of unreasonably detaining Nie Wenying, resulting in her death," many readers from Beijing, Shenyang, Dalian, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Henan and other places wrote to support Fan Yunshan's accusation, demanding that the Hebei Provincial People's Government promptly and seriously handle the incident.

    All readers expressed extreme indignation at the serious bureaucratic style of the Changping County People's Court in handling this matter. Air Force soldiers Zhang Nairang, Wang Cuitian, Li Jingyun and others wrote: "The volunteers are bravely fighting on the front lines in Korea, and the People's Liberation Army is staunchly defending the motherland; they are all protecting mothers and beloved children. But those judicial personnel with serious bureaucratic styles carelessly caused the death of Nie Wenying, depriving five children of their mother. This is such a hateful thing!" People's Liberation Army soldiers Liu Yunbo and Wang Weichen, Yu Dezhang from Shandong Electric Factory, Wei Xuanzuo from Yanzhou Salt Branch Company, Tang Shuqi from Dalian Match Factory and others wrote: "The People's Court is to protect the interests of the people and solve their difficulties. The erroneous behavior of the Changping County People's Court in handling the Nie Wenying incident has caused unfortunate consequences of harming the people. This is a serious crime."

    Why did this tragic incident occur? Readers from the Prairie of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Li Wenxiu, Yang Dehou, and Zhang Juxian from Beijing stores, and Shang Jianguang and Wang Qingchao from Gongxian County, Henan, pointed out in their letters: This is because the judicial personnel handling this case did not establish the viewpoint of serving the people, and were completely indifferent to the suffering of the masses, and thus did not investigate or study, but acted arbitrarily based on subjective assumptions. Zhang Kezheng, a reader from a factory in Shenyang, Zhao Jinshi, a reader from Jixian County, Pingyuan, and Yin Youyu, a reader from Ji'an, Liaodong, wrote: The Nie Wenying incident is a painful lesson, it tells us how harmful the old legal viewpoints and reactionary old judicial styles are to the people. They unanimously support the judicial reform movement that is being widely launched across the country, and demand that judicial workers earnestly transform their thinking and style of work, eliminate the influence of old legal viewpoints, and better serve the people.

    Readers unanimously believe that Fan Yunshan's ability to fight against bureaucratic phenomena is a manifestation of his increased political awareness. Li Youwu, Zhang Yongsheng, Yang Renqing from a certain Air Force school and Zhang Baocheng and other readers from Beijing wrote: From Fan Yunshan's accusation letter, it can be seen that he has trust in the people's government and hatred for bureaucratic styles. The people's government will definitely accept Fan Yunshan's accusation and seriously handle this incident. Everyone hopes that the Hebei Provincial People's Government will promptly and seriously handle this incident and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    各地读者纷纷来信支持工人范云山的控诉
    八月二十三日“读者来信专页”刊载了工人范云山控诉“昌平县人民法院无理扣押聂文英致死”的来信后，北京、沈阳、大连、内蒙自治区和河北、平原、山东、河南等地的很多读者纷纷来信，支持范云山的控诉，要求河北省人民政府迅速严正处理这一事件。
    所有读者对昌平县人民法院处理这个事件时的严重的官僚主义作风，表示极度愤慨。空军战士张乃让、王翠田、李景云等来信说：“志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇作战，解放军坚强地保卫着祖国；他们都在保卫着母亲和可爱的儿童。但那些有严重官僚主义作风的司法人员却毫不在乎地害死了聂文英，夺去了五个孩子的母亲。这是多么使人愤恨的事！”人民解放军某部战士刘云波、王伟臣，山东电器厂工人于德璋，兖州盐业支公司魏玄祚，大连火柴厂唐述琪等都来信说：“人民法院是保障人民利益、解决人民疾苦的。昌平县人民法院处理聂文英事件的错误行为却造成了损害人民的不幸后果。这是一种严重的罪恶。”
    为什么会造成这个惨痛的事件呢？内蒙自治区中苏友好协会草原，北京市店员李文秀、杨德厚、张聚贤，河南巩县读者尚建光、王清超等在来信中指出：这是因为处理这个案件的司法人员没有树立为人民服务的观点，对群众疾苦毫不关心，因而就不调查不研究，任凭主观臆断办事情。沈阳某厂读者张克正、平原汲县读者赵金石、辽东辑安读者印有郁等来信说：聂文英事件是一个惨痛的教训，它告诉我们旧法律观点和反动的旧司法作风对人民有多大的危害性。他们一致拥护正在全国普遍展开的司法改革运动，要求司法工作者认真改造自己的思想作风，肃清旧法律观点的影响，更好地为人民服务。
    读者一致认为范云山能够向官僚主义现象作斗争，是他政治觉悟提高的表现。空军某校李佑武、张永生、杨仁卿和北京市读者张宝成等来信说：从范云山的控诉信里可以看出：他对人民政府的信任和对官僚主义作风的愤恨。人民政府一定会接受范云山的控诉，认真处理这个事件。大家都希望河北省人民政府对这个事件迅速作严正处理，并把处理结果在报上发表。
