    Following the publication of the accusation by Zhang Zaixiang and Han Xiuying, family members of revolutionary martyrs, against He Bin, President of the Liuhe County People's Court, and Yan Siping, Judge of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court, for shielding counter-revolutionary criminals on the third page of this newspaper on August 21st, readers have continuously sent letters to this newspaper expressing their support and demanding severe punishment for He Bin, Yan Siping, and others.
    The entire staff of the electrical workshop of the Shandong Electrical Factory wrote: "We fully sympathize with and fully support the accusation of revolutionary martyr family members Zhang Zaixiang and Han Xiuying against He Bin and Yan Siping, who shielded counter-revolutionary elements." Bi Yan from the General Logistics Department Political Department directly under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Wen Yi from the Hygiene Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Li Wenyuan from No. 37, Dongsi Eight Alley, Beijing, and others wrote, saying: The crimes of He Bin and Yan Siping in shielding counter-revolutionary elements stained with blood are truly intolerable.

Liu Shuangjin from the Yutian County People's Court in Hebei Province, Lü Shouchang from the hospital of a certain unit of the Qingdao Public Security Forces, Tao Xiaolian from the Jiangyin Joint Transportation Station of the State-owned East China United Transportation Company, and others unanimously said angrily in their letters: We demand that people like He Bin and Yan Siping be expelled from the People's Court and severely punished to purify the organization of the People's Court and consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship.

    支持张在祥韩秀英的控诉
    ——读者来信综述
    八月二十一日本报第三版发表革命烈士家属张在祥、韩秀英对六合县人民法院院长何斌及南京市人民法院审判员晏嗣平包庇反革命罪犯提出的控诉，读者们连续给本报来信表示支持并要求严厉惩办何斌、晏嗣平等。
    山东电器厂电器间全体职工来信说：“革命烈士家属张在祥、韩秀英对包庇反革命分子的何斌、晏嗣平的控诉，我们完全同情，完全支持。”人民革命军事委员会总后勤部直属政治部毕言、鞍山钢铁公司卫生处温毅、北京市东四八条三十七号李文元等来信中都说：何斌、晏嗣平包庇血债累累的反革命分子的罪行，实在不能令人容忍。解放军某部罗正中和樵子、河南省煤矿管理局职员郭舟森、北京市第十六区人民政府王觉民、中国人民大学法律系二年级四班赵振宗等在来信中指出：何斌、晏嗣平等身为人民的司法人员，不但不正确地处理反革命分子，反而打击烈士家属们正义的控诉，等于支持反革命分子，完全失掉了应有的立场。河北省玉田县人民法院刘双进、青岛公安部队某部医院吕寿昌、国营华东联运公司江阴联运站陶晓连等在来信中一致愤怒地说：像何斌、晏嗣平这样的人，我们要求把他们从人民法院赶出去，要求严厉惩办他们，以纯洁人民法院的组织，巩固我们人民民主专政的政权。
