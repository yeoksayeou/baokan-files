    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Achievements in Eliminating Illiteracy in Vietnam
    Since the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam seven years ago, it has achieved significant progress in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. Among these, the most remarkable and important achievement in the field of culture and education is that illiteracy, which accounted for a large proportion of the national population, has been basically eliminated.
    For decades, the French imperialists' colonial rule over Vietnam plunged the Vietnamese people into a long-term state of cultural deprivation and ignorance. However, after the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in September 1945, this situation underwent a fundamental change. Over the past seven years, Vietnam's efforts to eliminate illiteracy have achieved remarkable results, with more than 14 million people nationwide escaping the misery of illiteracy. In the liberated areas, the number of illiterate people has dropped from 90 percent of the national population to about 20 percent.
    Six days after the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh signed a decree on the establishment of a Mass Education Department, literacy classes, and the implementation of compulsory education, calling on the people of the whole country, regardless of age, to complete this arduous task regularly with the spirit of mutual assistance and shock work.
    The material conditions at the time were very difficult. However, although the famine caused by the Japanese invaders and French colonialists' looting of food and wanton destruction was very serious, the Vietnamese people enthusiastically responded to President Ho Chi Minh's call. Within a few days, more than 2,000 young people in Hanoi alone were willing to serve as volunteer teachers, and many people donated paper, pens, ink, and other stationery, and voluntarily gave up their houses to be used as school buildings. Patriotic enthusiasm and the desire to learn swept the broad masses of the people into a surge of literacy movement. Old men with white hair, mothers nursing babies, and young children gathered together to study diligently. During the busy farming season, farmers took advantage of their rest time to organize literacy classes under the shade of trees and on the slopes of fields to study. Literacy classes were also widely established in factories, troops, and hospitals. Within four months after the August Revolution, nearly 300,000 illiterate people were eliminated and more than 30,000 literacy classes were established. More than a year later, the number of literacy classes increased to 60,000, and as many as 80,000 people volunteered to be volunteer teachers.
    In December 1946, the French colonialists perfidiously launched a full-scale offensive against the Vietnamese people. The outbreak of the war of resistance made Vietnam's literacy campaign encounter great difficulties. However, the Vietnamese government resolutely persisted in this work and put forward slogans such as "Learning is resisting" and "Every teacher is a propaganda captain of the war of resistance," so that the literacy movement continued to be promoted in combination with the work of the war of resistance. The industrious and brave Vietnamese people were not frightened by the difficulties caused by the war. They persisted in learning with extraordinary perseverance and hard work. Lacking stationery and equipment, they used wooden boards and walls to replace blackboards, branches and coal to replace pens and ink, and waste paper, betel nut leaves, and banana leaves to replace paper. In order to overcome the difficulty of inconsistent time, they divided into morning, afternoon, and evening classes to study; in order to overcome the difficulty of scattered areas, the teachers adopted the method of mobile teaching. Striving to learn and educating earnestly have become one of the main contents of the patriotic emulation movement of the Vietnamese people. In this way, the number of illiterate people in Vietnam has been rapidly reduced year by year. The Vietnamese liberated areas have a population of about 17 million. The number of literate people in 1945 was about 2 million, but now it has surged to 14 million. In more than a dozen provinces, illiteracy has almost been completely eliminated.
    Vietnam's literacy movement and mass education not only made the broad masses of the people become cultured and educated, but also greatly improved their political awareness and further recognized the evil aggressive policies of the US and French imperialists, thus further strengthening their determination and confidence in victoriously carrying out the "killing enemies and establishing merits, increasing production and practicing economy" emulation movement.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    越南扫除文盲的成就
    越南民主共和国成立七年以来，在军事、政治、经济与文化各方面都获得了重大的成就，其中在文教方面所获得的最显著、最重要的成就，就是在全国人口中占着极大比率的文盲已被基本肃清。
    法帝国主义数十年来对越南的殖民统治，使越南人民长期地陷于缺少文化的、愚昧的状态中。但是到了一九四五年九月越南民主共和国成立以后，这种情形就有了根本的转变。七年来，越南扫除文盲工作获得了优异的成绩，全国已有一千四百万以上的人民脱离了文盲的苦境。在解放区，文盲的人数已从占全国人口百分之九十的比率降到了百分之二十左右。
    越南民主共和国成立后的第六天，胡志明主席就签署了关于决定设立平民教育署、文盲识字班和实行强迫教育的法令，号召全国人民不分老幼用互助和突击的精神，定期完成这一艰巨任务。
    当时的物质条件是十分困难的。但是，虽然由于日本侵略者和法国殖民主义者掠夺粮食和肆意破坏所造成的饥荒十分严重，越南人民还是热烈地响应了胡志明主席的号召。在几天以内，仅仅在河内一地，就有二千多个青年愿意担任义务教师，许多群众都献出了纸张、笔墨和其他文具，并主动地让出房屋来做校舍。爱国的热情和学习的要求，把广大的人民卷入了识字运动的热潮中。鬓发皆白的老者、哺育婴儿的母亲和年幼的儿童，都聚集一堂孜孜不倦地学习着。在农忙中，农民利用了休息时间在树荫下和田坡旁组织识字班进行学习。在工厂、部队、医院中也普遍设立了识字班。在八月革命以后的四个月内，总共扫除了近三十万名文盲，成立了三万多个识字班。一年多以后，识字班的数目增至六万个，志愿担任义务教师的多达八万人。
    一九四六年十二月，法国殖民主义者背信弃义地对越南人民发动了全面进攻。抗战的爆发使得越南扫除文盲运动遇到极大的困难。但是，越南人民政府依然坚决坚持这一工作，并提出了“学习就是抗战”、“每个教员是一个抗战的宣传队长”等口号，使识字运动在与抗战工作相结合的情形下继续推行下去。勤劳、勇敢的越南人民并没有被战争所引起的困难所吓倒，他们以异常的毅力和刻苦的精神坚持学习。缺少文具和设备，他们就以木板和墙壁来代替黑板，用树枝煤块来代替笔墨，用废纸、槟榔叶和香蕉叶来代替纸张。为了克服时间不一致的困难，他们分成早班、午班和夜班来学习；为了克服地区分散的困难，教员们就采用了巡回教学方式。努力学习、认真教育，已成为越南全国人民爱国竞赛运动的主要内容之一。这样，越南的文盲数目就一年一年地迅速减少。越南解放区共有人口一千七百万左右，识字的人数在一九四五年是二百万左右，而现在已激增至一千四百万了。在十多个省份内，文盲几乎已被彻底肃清。
    越南的识字运动和平民教育，不但使得广大人民成为有文化有教养的人，而且也使他们大大地提高了政治觉悟，进一步认清了美、法帝国主义者罪恶的侵略政策，因而更加增强了胜利进行“杀敌立功、增产节约”竞赛运动的决心和信心。
