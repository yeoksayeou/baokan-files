    U.S. Interferes in Greek Internal Affairs
    Because the Greek Minister of Education, Michael, was ill, the Greek government decided to temporarily appoint Bababoritis as Minister of Education, relieving him of his position as Minister of Trade. According to newspaper reports, the King refused to allow Bababoritis to take the oath of office as Minister of Education because Bababoritis belonged to the left wing of the "National Progressive League." At the same time, it is generally pointed out that the Americans are also trying their best to oppose the appointment of Bababoritis as Minister of Education.

    U.S. Government Uses Money to Lure Young People to Risk Their Lives in Korea

The conditions for U.S. soldiers to receive this allowance are "being deployed to the war zone for at least six days within a month," and for naval or air force personnel, it is "as long as they are subjected to shooting and explosions by the Communist army."

    U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Murphy, a spy chief, in order to cooperate with the re-militarization of Japan, is attempting to intensify the creation of public opinion and is planning to buy off local newspapers. It is reported that Murphy has set his sights on newspapers such as "Tokyo Shimbun," "Hokkaido Shimbun," "Kobe Shimbun," and "Kyushu Daily," and Morgan, a cadre of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, a U.S. spy agency, is already working on the acquisition.

    Atrocities by U.S. Soldiers in Austria Continue Unabated
    Austrian newspapers report daily on the continuous atrocities of American soldiers.
    On August 31, near Zell am See, a U.S. vehicle ran over an Austrian named Josef Eder, breaking both of his legs. On September 1, in Salzburg, a U.S. military vehicle ran over an Austrian named Johann Bruckner. He was taken to the hospital due to serious injuries. On September 2, two Americans got into a street fight, and a bullet fired by one of them shattered the window of a store. Despite repeated assurances from the U.S. occupying authorities that they will take measures to stop such atrocities, not a single perpetrator has been punished.
