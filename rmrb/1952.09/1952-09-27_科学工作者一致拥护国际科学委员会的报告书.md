    Scientific Workers Unanimously Support the Report of the International Scientific Commission
    Editor's Note: Many medical workers, bacteriology experts, and agricultural scientists from more than twenty units, including the Veterinary Bureau of the General Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, the Central People's Hospital, the Medical College of Peking University, the Beijing Infectious Disease Hospital, the Central Institute of Biological Products, and the North China Agricultural Science Institute, have written to this newspaper in groups or individually, warmly supporting the "Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China," denouncing the heinous crime of the United States in conducting bacterial warfare, and unanimously expressing their willingness to contribute everything they have to eliminate the evil bacterial warfare and to defend humanity and science. The following are excerpts from the letters.
    The Report Proves that Bacterial Weapons Absolutely Cannot Intimidate the Chinese and Korean People
    To the Editor: After reading the "Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China," as a scientific worker, I feel that this is a fair and scientific report.
    The organization of this commission itself is fair. Its members are world-renowned scientists who participated in this investigation work related to the future of all mankind with a scientific attitude. They knew that they were accountable to the people of the world, so in their work, they were free from prejudice, completely objective, and treated the facts before them with a high degree of scientific spirit. They adopted a scientific and logical working method. They analyzed many abnormal phenomena, which, since they could not have occurred naturally, had only one explanation: they were man-made and always related to American air raids. Such scientific analysis forced the commission to conclude "in light of the facts" and announce to the world that the United States had indeed used bacterial weapons against China and Korea.
    This scientific conclusion irrefutably exposed the nature of American imperialism before the people of the world. When they could not succeed in the Korean War by "fighting," "negotiating," or "dragging on," they did not hesitate to be enemies of all mankind and used bacterial weapons. They knew that this would inevitably be condemned by all mankind, so they shamelessly denied it in every possible way. Now that the people of the world—including the American people—have seen this powerful report, there will no longer be the slightest doubt. Some scientists who previously held illusions about American imperialism should further clarify their misconceptions.
    This report also tells the people of the world: American imperialism, no matter what weapons it uses—including the use of inhumane bacterial weapons—can absolutely not intimidate the Chinese and Korean people. Peace-loving people have the power to eliminate the poisons and pests spread by American imperialism anytime, anywhere.
    Zhu Guiqing, Professor of Internal Medicine, China Union Medical College

    Righteous Bacteriology Workers Should Rise Up to Stop Bacterial Warfare
    To the Editor: The "Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China" has been published before the peace-loving people of the world. It once again confirms that the crimes of American imperialism are undeniable, and at the same time refutes the shameless sophistry of a few reactionary "bacteriology workers" in the United States.
    Bacteriology is an emerging science that has been developed by scientists in recent decades to understand the activity patterns of pathogens that cause diseases in humans and livestock, and to study how to enhance the resistance of human and animal bodies. To achieve this goal, bacteriologists have spent countless efforts and sacrificed the lives of many excellent scientists. The actions of bacteriologists in seeking health and happiness for the people are glorious and great; but the American imperialists have lost all humanity, stealing the achievements of science to use as weapons of murder. This shameless act is intolerable to every peace-loving person, especially bacteriology workers with a sense of international humanitarianism, and they should immediately rise up to condemn it severely. I completely agree with the report of the International Scientific Commission and the statement of Dr. Frank Grauchi. Their opinions truly express the voices of microbiologists with a sense of justice around the world. Although there are indeed some reactionary "bacteriology workers" in the United States who are racking their brains for Wall Street war merchants; there are more bacteriology scholars who are full of justice and international humanitarianism, and they are working hard to stop this evil act. This ensures that human civilization will surely triumph.
    In 1948, I mistakenly joined the "American Society for Microbiology." Now I am deeply ashamed of having been with these reactionary "bacteriology workers"! In addition to having solemnly declared my withdrawal from the association, I also hope that members of the association with a sense of justice, for the sake of the dignity of science and the happiness of mankind, will no longer be paralyzed, quickly bravely unite with the peace-loving people of the world, and strive to maintain human peace and the glorious tradition of bacteriology; in the camp of maintaining lasting human peace, we bacteriology workers have a glorious and arduous task to fulfill.

    Strengthen Effective Measures Against Bacterial Warfare to Protect Our Beautiful Farmlands and Orchards
    To the Editor: The "Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China" once again proves the ugly face of the American aggressors. The American aggressors did indeed use various bacterial weapons in a planned way to massacre innocent people, and also attempted to implement unprecedented agricultural biological warfare, using bacteria to destroy agricultural production in the rear of Korea and in Northeast China. They dropped packages of peach tree leaves infected with the ring pattern brown rot fungus near Xiuyan County, Liaodong Province, spreading a deadly disease in our fruit-producing areas that had never existed locally. This series of crimes by the American aggressors can only strengthen our determination to eliminate the scourge of bacteria.
    The Northeast is one of the main grain-producing areas in our country, and thousands of agricultural scientific workers are working with hundreds of millions of good farmers to increase crop yields and ensure the harvest of crops and fruits. Can we allow the American aggressors to unscrupulously carry out agricultural biological warfare on the land of our motherland? No! Absolutely not. After the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacterial warfare and agricultural biological warfare have been confirmed by world-renowned scientists, on the one hand, we must loudly appeal to the peace-loving people of the world to jointly use justice to stop this inhumane crime; on the other hand, we must unite with the agricultural scientific workers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, mobilize the masses, and resolutely eliminate any plant pathogens or pests used by the American aggressors as tools of aggression. Since the American aggressors used bacterial weapons in January this year, we have cooperated with relevant departments to step up the production of the insecticide "666" and other agricultural medicines, adding a force to the anti-epidemic front in the motherland and Korea. We know that the vicious American aggressors are capable of doing anything, and in the future, we must strengthen effective measures to eliminate various foreign pests and pathogens, so that they have no chance to spread in our beautiful farmlands and orchards.

    The Report of the International Scientific Commission Points the Way for Scientists Around the World
    To the Editor: Following the trial of "Former Japanese Army Personnel Accused of Preparing and Using Bacterial Weapons" held in Khabarovsk, Soviet Union, in December 1949, today, with the publication of the "Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China," the trial of new bacterial war criminals by the peace-loving people of the world is not far off.
    This report by international scientists is a major contribution to peace and science. It will leave an indelible brilliance in Chinese history and human history; it tells the Chinese people, the people of the world, and future generations of mankind: the American aggressors shamelessly attempted to use bacteria and viruses to stop the progress of mankind and eliminate human civilization. The honesty, courage, and realistic spirit shown by the members of the International Scientific Commission in defending peace and truth have also pointed out the path that scientific workers around the world should take. Those "scientific workers" who serve the bacterial warfare of American imperialism appear so small and despicable under the light of this just and scientific report. If they do not stop these anti-peace and anti-science crimes as soon as possible, they will be subject to due sanctions, and their notoriety will be reviled by us and their descendants in the scientific history of mankind.
    This report has deeply educated us, making us more clearly aware of what to love and what to hate. Although most of us have studied in the United States or Japan, the path we are taking today is in a completely different direction from the path taken by that small group of scientific traitors who participated in bacterial warfare; we are using scientific knowledge to benefit mankind, while they are trying to harm peace-loving people.
    The authenticity and scientific nature of the report are already indisputable, and we would also like to add some explanations in connection with the work we are studying. The section on "Plant Pathology Materials" in the report mentioned that the American aggressors spread peach tree leaves infected with the Macrophoma Kuwatsukai Hara pathogen in our country. We investigated and studied the apple ring pattern brown rot disease caused by this pathogen in Sichuan in 1942. We have never seen a peach leaf infected with this disease in orchards in Chengdu and other parts of China. Since 1950, we have repeatedly investigated fruit tree diseases in Liaodong Province, the Dalian area, and various parts of North China, and have never found an apple tree or pear tree parasitized by this pathogen. We consulted the report of the pseudo-Manchukuo Agricultural Experiment Station "List of Crop Diseases in Manchuria" and the "Survey Report of Major Crops in Manchuria" written by the famous Japanese plant pathologist Kakugoro Nakada. The former recorded thirty-three kinds of apple diseases, thirteen kinds of pear diseases, and seven kinds of peach diseases; the latter report recorded thirty-nine kinds of pear diseases and one kind of apple disease, but neither of them mentioned that this pathogen had ever parasitized apple trees or pear trees. The facts are clearly there: the peach tree leaves infected with Macrophoma Kuwatsukai Hara were spread from airplanes by the American aggressors.
    This brilliant achievement of the International Scientific Commission should further remind scientists around the world who love peace and justice: for the sake of human safety and the dignity of science, we must unite more closely and resolutely sanction the crimes of American bacterial war criminals!

### 科学工作者一致拥护国际科学委员会的报告书

专栏：读者来信

    科学工作者一致拥护国际科学委员会的报告书
    编者按：中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总后方勤务部兽医局、中央人民医院、北京大学医学院、北京传染病院、中央生物制品研究所、华北农业科学研究所等二十几个单位的许多医务工作人员、细菌学专家和农业科学工作者，纷纷以团体或个人的名义写信给本报，热烈拥护“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”，同声指责美国进行细菌战的滔天罪行，并一致表示愿意为扑灭万恶的细菌战、为保卫人类和科学而贡献出自己的一切。下面是来信中的一部分。
    报告书证明了细菌武器绝对吓不了中朝人民
    编辑同志：读了“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”后，作为一个科学工作者，我觉得这是一个公正的、科学的报告。
    这个委员会的组织本身是公正的。它的成员是世界知名的科学家，他们抱着科学态度来参加这个有关全人类前途的调查工作。他们知道这是要向全世界人民负责的，所以他们在工作中处处摆脱成见、完全客观、用高度科学精神来对待摆在他们面前的事实。他们采取了合乎科学逻辑的工作方法。他们分析了很多的反常现象，这些反常现象既然不可能是自然发生的，那只有一个解释：就是人工造成的，并且总是与美国空袭有关的。这样的科学分析，使委员会不得不“迫于事实”而下结论，向全世界公布美国的确对中、朝两国使用了细菌武器。
    这种科学的结论就无可置辩地在全世界人民面前暴露了美帝国主义的本质。他们在侵朝战争上，用“战”、“和”、“拖”都不能得逞时，就不惜与全人类为敌，使用了细菌武器。他们明知这样必然会遭到全世界人类的谴责，所以他们又无耻地百般狡赖。现在当全世界人民——包括美国人民——看到了这个有力的报告，是不会再有丝毫的怀疑了。一些以往对美帝国主义还存着幻想的科学家们，也应该进一步澄清自己的错误认识了。
    这个报告书也告诉了全世界人民：美帝国主义不论用什么武器——包括使用灭绝人性的细菌武器——是绝对吓不倒中朝人民的。爱好和平的人民有力量随时随地扑灭美帝国主义撒下来的毒物毒虫。中国协和医学院内科教授朱贵卿
    正义的细菌学工作者应该起来制止细菌战
    编辑同志：“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”在世界爱好和平人民的面前公布了。它再一次地证实了美帝国主义的罪行是不容抵赖的，同时也驳斥了美国少数反动的“细菌学工作者”的无耻狡辩。
    细菌学是近几十年来科学家为着了解使人类和家畜致病的病原菌的活动规律，以及研究如何增强人、畜体的抵抗力而发展起来的新兴科学。为着达到这个目的，不知费尽了细菌学家们多少脑汁和牺牲了多少优秀科学家的生命。细菌学家这种替人民谋健康和幸福的事迹是光荣伟大的；可是美帝国主义者却丧尽了人性，偷窃科学的成果，来作为杀人的武器。这一无耻行为是每一个爱好和平的人们，特别是有国际人道主义感的细菌学工作者所不能容忍而应急起严厉地加以声讨的。我完全同意国际科学委员会的报告书和法朗克·葛拉求西博士的声明。他们的意见真正表达了全世界有正义感的微生物学家的呼声。在美国固然有不少反动的“细菌学工作者”在替华尔街战争贩子绞脑汁；但更多的是富有正义感和国际人道主义的细菌学者们，他们正在为制止这种罪恶的行为而辛勤工作着。这就保证了人类文明一定会胜利。
    在一九四八年我曾错误地加入过“美国细菌学会”，现在我深为曾经和这些反动的“细菌学工作者”为伍而感到可耻！我除已严正申明退出该会外，并希望该会有正义感的会员们，为了科学的尊严和人类的幸福，不要再麻痹下去了，赶快勇敢地和世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，为维护人类的和平及细菌学光荣的传统而奋斗；在维护人类永久和平的阵营里，我们细菌学工作者是有一份应尽的光荣和艰巨的任务的。

    加强反细菌战的有效措施保卫我们美好的农田果园
    编辑同志：“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”，再一次证明了美国侵略者的丑恶面目。美国侵略者的确是有计划地用各种细菌武器来屠杀无辜的人民，并且还企图实行史无前例的农业生物战，利用细菌来破坏朝鲜后方和我国东北的农业生产。他们把成包的染有轮纹褐腐病菌的桃树叶子在辽东省岫严县附近投下来，在我们的果产区散布一种当地从来未有的致命的病害。美国侵略者这一连串的罪行，只能更加强了我们消灭细菌祸害的决心。
    东北是我国主要的粮食产区之一，千百个农业科学工作者正和亿万的善良农民一道在努力提高作物产量，保证庄稼和果品的丰收。我们能让美国侵略者肆无忌惮地在祖国的土地上进行农业生物战吗？不能！绝对不能。在美国侵略者使用细菌战和农业生物战的罪行已得到世界著名的科学家们证实后，我们一方面要向全世界爱好和平的人们大声疾呼，一致用正义来制止这种灭绝人性的罪行；另一方面，我们要联合朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的农业科学工作者，发动群众，坚决扑灭任何被美国侵略者用来做为侵略工具的植物病菌或害虫。自从今年一月美国侵略者使用细菌武器以来，我们即配合有关部门加紧生产杀虫剂“六六六”和其他农用药品，给祖国和朝鲜的防疫战线增加一份力量。我们知道穷凶极恶的美国侵略者是什么花样都干得出来的，今后我们更要加强扑灭各种外来害虫和病菌的有效措施，使它们没有在我们美好的农田和果园里传布开来的机会。　　华北农业科学研究所全体职工
    国际科学委员会的报告书给全世界科学家指出了道路
    编辑同志：继一九四九年十二月在苏联伯力城举行的“前日本陆军军人因准备和使用细菌武器被控案”的审判之后，今天，随着“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”的发表，全世界爱好和平的人民审判新的细菌战犯又为期不远了。
    国际科学家们这一报告书，对和平对科学都是一项重大的贡献。它将在中国历史上和人类历史上留下不可磨灭的光辉；它告诉了中国人民、全世界人民以及人类的后一代：美国侵略者极其可耻地企图利用细菌病毒来阻止人类的进步，消灭人类的文明。国际科学委员会的委员们为了保卫和平和真理所表现的这种正直、勇敢和实事求是的精神，也给全世界的科学工作者指出了应当走的道路。为美帝国主义的细菌战服务的那些“科学工作者”们，在这一正义的和科学的光辉照耀之下，显得多么渺小和卑鄙。假如他们不及早停止这种反和平、反科学的罪行，他们必将受到应得的制裁，他们的臭名也将在人类的科学历史上，被我们及他们的子子孙孙所唾骂。
    这一报告书深深地教育了我们，使我们更清楚地认识了爱什么和恨什么。我们中间大多数人虽然曾在美国或日本留过学，但我们今天所走的道路，和那一小撮参加细菌战的科学叛徒们所走的道路完全是两个方向；我们正在用科学知识为人类谋福利，而他们却在企图伤害和平的人民。
    报告书的真实性和科学性已经是无可置辩的了，我们还愿意联系自己所研究的工作来再加说明。报告书中有关“植物病理学的资料”一节内，曾提到美国侵略者在我国散布的染有MacrophomaKuwat-sukai    Hara病菌的桃树叶子。我们曾于一九四二年在四川调查研究过这种病菌所引起的苹果轮纹褐腐病。我们在成都以及其他中国各地的果园内从来没有看到过一株桃叶染有这种病害。从一九五零年起，我们又多次调查了辽东省、旅大区以及华北各地的果树病害，也未曾发现过一株苹果树或梨树有这种病菌寄生。我们查考了伪满农事试验场的报告“满洲国农作物病害目录”以及日本著名的植物病理学家中田觉五郎所著的“满洲主要作物调查报告”。前者记载了三十三种苹果的病害，十三种梨的病害，七种桃的病害；后一报告记载了三十九种梨的病害和一种苹果病害，但都没有提到这种病菌曾在苹果树或梨树上寄生过。事实已经明显地放在那里：染有Macrophoma    Kuwatsukai    Hara的桃树叶子是美国侵略者从飞机上散布下来的。
    国际科学委员会这一辉煌的成就，应当更进一步提醒全世界爱好和平与正义的科学家们：为了人类的安全和科学的尊严，必须更加紧密地团结起来，坚决制裁美国细菌战犯的罪行！
