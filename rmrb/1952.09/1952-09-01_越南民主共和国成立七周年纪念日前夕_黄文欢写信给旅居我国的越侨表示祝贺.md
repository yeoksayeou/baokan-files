    [Reported by this newspaper] On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hoang Van Hoan, Ambassador-level Representative of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, wrote a letter to all Vietnamese compatriots residing in China, expressing congratulations and greetings. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    Dear Overseas Compatriots in China:
    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on behalf of the Vietnamese government and President Ho Chi Minh.
    It has been seven full years since our country gained independence, and our war to defend that independence against French colonialists and American imperialist interventionists is also nearing seven years.
    For seven years, under the wise leadership of President Ho, we have forced the enemy to suffer a series of defeats, and their aggressive forces are becoming increasingly weakened. Conversely, on our side, the people's regime is becoming increasingly consolidated, the national united front is developing, the army is growing stronger, and the national economy and finances are becoming more stable, ensuring the livelihood of the people and the supply of the army. There has also been considerable progress in the social sphere, such as fourteen million people being freed from illiteracy, and no famines, floods, or epidemics occurring since the start of the war. The alliance of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos has been established and consolidated. Vietnam's international standing has become equal to that of other democratic countries. These great achievements have filled all Vietnamese people with boundless excitement.
    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have defeated American imperialism and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, established the People's Republic of China, and made leaping progress in all aspects of construction, becoming a strong and powerful fortress for defending peace in Asia. The victory of the Chinese revolution shattered the blockade of the French colonialists and American imperialist interventionists against us, connecting our country with the democratic countries, and providing us with a strong and incomparable camp of peace and democracy, which has brought more favorable conditions for us to win the war. For overseas compatriots in China, who used to suffer all kinds of oppression and discrimination under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, today they have gained freedom and equality, and have sufficient conditions to pursue a legitimate life and develop patriotism. This is another matter that is particularly gratifying and encouraging.
    Overseas compatriots have always shown a spirit of love for the motherland, support for the democratic republican system, and support for the war of resistance, and have also shown friendship and cooperation to the Chinese people, maintaining the inherent friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples. These are all very good and very welcome.
    However, the closer our war of resistance gets to victory, the more difficulties we will encounter, and the more frantic and brutal the enemy will become as they reach the end of their road. They are now intensifying their exploitation and persecution of the people in the occupied areas, and wherever their bestial footprints reach, they are wantonly killing, destroying, and looting. They are also ordering traitorous puppets to forcibly recruit puppet troops, attempting to realize the heinous conspiracy of "using Vietnamese to control Vietnamese."
    Our compatriots at home are joining the soldiers at the front in a "kill the enemy and perform meritorious service, increase production and practice thrift" competition, striving to overcome all difficulties, smash all the enemy's conspiracies, and are determined to fight to the end to defend the independence of the motherland and the liberation of the nation. Therefore, overseas compatriots should be more united and actively support the war of resistance; be more friendly and cooperative with the Chinese people, sincerely and willingly participate in China's various construction undertakings, and especially strive to learn from the valuable experiences of China's land reform, resistance to America and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, and ideological remolding, in order to improve their political level, so as to make more contributions to the future construction of the motherland, so that they are worthy of being good citizens of the new Vietnam.
    Our war of resistance is arduous, but under the leadership of President Ho, with the concerted efforts of all the people, and with the support of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, we will surely win the final victory.
    I wish you good health and unity!

    越南民主共和国成立七周年纪念日前夕
    黄文欢写信给旅居我国的越侨表示祝贺
    【本报讯】越南民主共和国驻华代表团大使衔代表黄文欢在越南民主共和国成立七周年纪念日前夕，写信给旅居中国的全体越南侨胞，表示祝贺与问候之意。该信全文如下：亲爱的旅华全体侨胞们：
    值此越南民主共和国成立七周年纪念日之际，我谨代表越南政府和胡志明主席向你们致亲爱的祝贺。
    我们国家得到独立到现在已整整七年，而我们反对法国殖民者和美帝国主义干涉者的保卫独立的战争也快要七年了。
    七年来，在胡主席的英明领导下，我们已迫使敌人遭受了一连串的失败，它们的侵略力量是愈来愈削弱了。反之，在我们这一方面则人民政权日趋巩固，民族统一战线日益发展，军队日趋强大，国家经济财政日趋稳定，使人民的生活和部队的供给有了保证。在社会方面也有不少的进展，如一千四百万人脱离了文盲的境遇，抗战以来没发生过饥荒、水灾及瘟疫等灾害。越南、高棉、寮国等三个民族的人民联盟已经成立和巩固起来了。越南在国际上的地位已经和各民主国家齐行并列了。这些伟大的成就使越南全体人民感到无限的振奋。
    中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，已打垮了美帝国主义和蒋介石的反动统治，成立了中华人民共和国，各方面的建设都有着飞跃的进步，成为保卫亚洲和平的坚强有力的堡垒。中国革命的胜利粉碎了法国殖民者和美帝国主义干涉者对我们的封锁，使我国与各民主国家连成一片，使我们背靠着强大无比的和平民主阵营，这就为我们争取抗战的胜利带来更多的有利条件。对旅华侨胞来讲，从前处在国民党反动派的统治下曾备受种种压迫与歧视的痛苦，今天已经得到了自由平等，有足够的条件来谋求正当的生活和发展爱国主义精神。这又是一件值得特别庆幸和鼓舞的事情。
    侨胞们向来就表示着热爱祖国，拥护民主共和制度与支援抗战的精神，对中国人民也表示亲善和合作，保持着越中两国人民固有的友谊。这些都是很好并且很值得欢迎的。
    但我们抗战事业越接近胜利就越会遇到更多的艰难，敌人越到途穷末路就越加疯狂与残暴。它们现在正加紧对被占领区人民的剥削和迫害，它们兽迹所至的地方就横加杀戮、破坏和抢劫。它们并命令卖国傀儡们强募伪军，企图实现“以越制越”的罪恶阴谋。
    我们国内同胞正和前方战士并肩进行着“杀敌立功，增产节约”的竞赛运动，努力克服一切困难，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋，决心为保卫祖国的独立和民族的解放而战斗到底。因此海外侨胞们自应更加团结和积极拥护抗战；更加与中国人民友好和合作，诚心乐意地参加中国的各项建设事业，尤其是要努力学习中国的土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、三反、五反和改造思想等运动的宝贵经验，进而提高自己的政治水平，以便在将来的祖国建设事业中作出更多贡献，这样才不愧为新越南的好公民。
    我们的抗战事业是艰巨的，但在胡主席的领导下、在全体人民一致的努力下和在以苏联为首的民主阵营与全世界人民的支援下，我们是一定获得最后胜利的。
    敬祝你们健康和团结！
