    On the mountains of the Qinling and Longshan mountain ranges, slogans are inscribed everywhere: "Build the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, Develop the Great Northwest!" This slogan expresses the determination and ideals of the heroes who built the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is 347 kilometers long. Starting from Tianshui, it must pass through the continuous Qinling and Longshan mountain ranges, cross the Wei River, the Kushui River, the Xianshui River, and the Qingshui River before reaching its destination in Lanzhou. To build a flat road in such high mountains and deep valleys, dozens of large tunnels must be opened in the mountains composed of hard rocks, quicksand, red clay, etc., and tens of thousands of cubic meters of earth must be filled and retaining walls tens of meters high and hundreds of meters long must be built in many canyons dozens of meters deep. What a difficult project this is! But railway workers and laborers from North China, South China, Southwest China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, in order to realize the great ideal of "Building the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, Developing the Great Northwest," finally paved this road ahead of schedule with selfless spirit and countless efforts and sweat.

    In the arduous task of opening tunnels, the workers displayed a high degree of creativity, came up with many tricks, and overcame various difficulties. The rapid construction of a hard rock tunnel in a certain area is an example. The first step in building a tunnel is to open a pilot tunnel. According to past practice, a hole two meters wide and two meters high was dug first, and then gradually expanded. However, because the hole was small, it was difficult to use machines, and the progress was very slow. In order to ensure the completion of the task ahead of schedule, the workers could not tolerate this slow old method. After everyone's research, they found a new method, expanding the pilot tunnel to three meters wide and two and a half meters high. In this way, the working surface was widened. In the past, the cave could only accommodate one pneumatic drill to drill blasting holes, but now it can accommodate two. After the drilling efficiency was improved, there was a problem of untimely supply of explosives. Worker Zhang Weitian developed a new method of preparing explosives, which made the explosives prepared quickly and powerfully. He also created a hand-cranked machine for making explosive fuses, which increased the efficiency of making explosive fuses tenfold. The efficiency of drilling holes and blasting was improved, and the problem of transporting slag occurred again, because the terrain outside the cave was higher than inside the cave, and the slag was transported very slowly. In order to improve the efficiency of transporting slag, the workers came up with a method of laying light rails on two upper and lower layers, and using a winch to pull small flat cars to transport slag. In the past, each small team could only transport 45 cars a day, but after using this method, an average of 121 cars could be transported, and the maximum reached 150 cars. After this series of improvements, the record of opening pilot tunnels increased from 8 centimeters per day to 8.2 meters.

    As the cave deepened, the air became difficult to circulate. The workers transporting slag were often fainted by the smoke, but they encouraged themselves with the spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and after waking up, they went in and carried as usual. A laborer named Zhang Daoxue fainted from the smoke. After waking up, the captain asked him to rest, but he resolutely refused, fearing that it would affect the progress of the project. He said: "Compared with the heroes of the Volunteers, what is fainting?" One day, laborer Liu Junchao fainted three times. After each emergency treatment, he struggled to enter the cave again. He said to others: "The people of the whole country are looking forward to the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. How can I lie down with peace of mind!"

    In addition to opening tunnels, the task of building the roadbed was also extremely arduous. To build a roadbed on the rolling mountains, many canyons must be filled. Each canyon needs to be filled with tens of thousands of cubic meters of earth. On the edge of the roadbed, retaining walls tens of meters high and hundreds of meters long must be built with cement and flagstones to protect the roadbed. If the roadbed is not built on time, the track-laying workers will not be able to lay the rails, and the track-laying project cannot be completed ahead of schedule.

    Most of the workers undertaking this great project were local peasants who had been liberated in response to the government's call. They knew that the completion of the railway would bring them greater happiness. Therefore, for the sake of building the road, they hardly knew what fatigue was. After working for a day, many people still put their shovels and spades beside their pillows at night, and quietly climbed up to work in the middle of the night. In order to take care of their health, the captain had to collect the tools every night. Feng Zhifa's family sent letters several times asking him to go home to get married. His companions advised him to take a few days off to go home to get married and then come back. But he firmly replied: "Let's get married after the railway is built to Lanzhou!" This spring, he followed the engineering team to the construction site near Lanzhou. His companions could not see him during the lunch break every day, so everyone began to discuss: "The young man must be going to play with the girls." One day after lunch, the squad leader secretly followed him to investigate his secret. Only then did he discover that he was not playing with the girls, but was going to the river beach to pick up stones for making cement.

    Due to the limitations of the natural conditions in the Northwest, the life of the road construction workers is very hard. Take drinking water as an example. The water in the areas of Longxi County and Dingxi County contains a lot of alkali and saltpeter, and it is also astringent and bitter. It is easy to cause diarrhea. The local people drink snow water stored in underground cellars from the previous year. When the railway engineering team arrived there, it was too late to store snow, and they had to transport water from dozens of miles away. Sometimes transportation becomes difficult, and bitter water becomes the only drink. However, in order to save transportation costs, they often did not let the cars transport water after finding a water source with less alkali and saltpeter. In this way, the First Engineering Team alone saved 1 billion yuan in water transportation costs.

    The engineering team is constantly moving and can only live in tents. In this mountainous and highland area, the climate changes greatly in the early morning and evening. At noon in summer, the tent is like a big steamer under the direct sunlight, and the temperature reaches a maximum of 45 degrees Celsius. But at night, it is still cold to sleep with a quilt. In winter, when it is coldest, the temperature drops to minus 18 degrees, and the frost on the tent forms a thick layer of ice. The workers' hands were chapped and their feet were swollen with frostbite, but what they thought of was not that they were freezing, but that they were afraid that the severe cold would affect the quality of the project. When mixing cement, they tried to wrap the cement mixing models with dry grass and used hot water to mix the cement. In this way, they could take turns mixing for more than 20 hours in the ice and snow, and the quality of the project would not be affected at all.

    Despite the tight work and hard life, the workers regarded building the motherland as the greatest glory and the greatest happiness. Every evening, there are songs everywhere on the hillside. Qinqiang Opera, Cantonese ditties, Henan tunes, Peking Opera, and the whistle of the basketball commander are intertwined. Among them, a loud singing voice often overshadowed everything and vibrated in the rolling mountains for a long, long time:

    "In order to build a new China, we are not afraid of hardship or difficulty. Our strength is like clear spring water, inexhaustible and inexhaustible."

    The workers who built the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, with such heroic spirit, dug through the most solid mountains and filled the valleys dozens of meters deep, so that the rails were laid from Tianshui to Lanzhou ten months ahead of schedule.

### 修筑天兰铁路的英雄们

    修筑天兰铁路的英雄们
    新华社记者　林印
    在秦岭和陇山山脉的山峦上，到处刻着“修通天兰路，建设大西北”的大字标语。这个标语说出了修筑天兰路的英雄们的决心和理想。天兰路全长三百四十七公里，从天水出发，必须穿过连绵起伏的秦岭和陇山山脉，跨过渭河、苦水河、咸水河、清水河，然后才到达它的终点兰州。要在这样的高山深谷中铺起一条平坦大道，就要在由坚硬的岩石或流沙、红胶土等构成的大山上开出几十个大隧道，就要在许多几十丈深的峡谷中填上几万方土和筑成几十丈高、几百丈长的御土墙。这是多么艰巨的工程啊！但是来自华北、华南、西南、东北和西北地区的铁路职工和民工们，为了实现“修通天兰路，建设大西北”的伟大理想，他们终于以忘我的精神和无数的心血和汗水提前铺平了这条道路。
    在开隧道的艰巨工程中，工人们发挥了高度的创造性，想出许多窍门，克服了各种各样的困难。某地坚石隧道的迅速修通就是一个例子。修隧道的第一步工程是开导洞。按以往惯例，是先挖一个两公尺宽两公尺高的洞子，然后逐渐扩大。但是因为洞小，使用机器困难，进度很慢。为了保证提前完成任务，工人们不能容忍这种慢吞吞的老办法。经过大家研究，他们找到了新办法，把导洞扩大成三公尺宽，两公尺半高。这样一来，工作面加宽了，过去洞里只能容纳一个风钻打炮眼，现在可以容纳两个。打眼效率提高后，发生了火药供应不及时的问题。工人张维田研究出一种配制炸药的新办法，使炸药配制得又快，威力又大。他还创造了一种制炸药引线的手摇机，使制炸药引线的效率提高了十倍。打眼和放炮的效率都提高了，又发生了运石碴的问题，因为洞外地势比洞内高，石碴运得很慢。为了提高运石碴的效率，工人们想出分上下两层铺轻便铁轨，用绞盘牵引小平车运石碴的办法。过去每一小班一天只能运四十五车，运用这个办法后平均可运一百二十一车，最高达到一百五十车。经过这一系列的改进，开导洞的纪录就从每天进展八公寸提高到八点二公尺。
    洞子挖深了，空气不易流通。运石碴的工人常常被烟薰得晕倒了，但他们用中国人民志愿军的精神来勉励自己，醒过来以后又照常进去搬运。有一个叫张道雪的民工，被烟薰倒了，醒来后，队长让他休息，但他怕影响工程进度，坚决不肯休息。他说：“比起志愿军英雄来，晕倒了算什么。”民工刘俊超有一天晕倒了三次，每次经过急救之后，又挣扎着进洞去。他向别人说：“全国老百姓眼巴巴盼望天兰路通车，我怎能安心躺下哩！”
    除了开隧道之外，筑路基的工程也是异常艰巨的。要在起伏的山峦上筑路基，必须填平许多峡谷。每个峡谷都需要填几万方土。在路基的边沿，还必须用洋灰和片石砌起几十丈高和几百丈长的御土墙来保护路基。如果路基不按时筑好，钉道队工人就无法铺轨，铺轨工程就不能提前完成。
    担任这个伟大工程的工人，大部是响应政府号召而来的当地翻身农民。他们懂得修通铁路会给他们带来更大的幸福。因此，为了修路，他们几乎不知道什么叫疲倦。许多人在劳动了一天以后，晚上还把铁锹和铁铲放在枕边睡觉，半夜再悄悄地爬起来工作。队长为了照顾他们的健康，不得不在每天夜晚把家具收藏起来。民工冯志法家里几次带信来要他回去结婚，同伴们都劝他请几天假回家结了婚再来。但他却坚决地回答说：“等铁路修到了兰州再结婚吧！”今年春天他跟着工程队到了兰州附近的工地。每天中午休息时同伴们都看不见他，于是大家就议论开了：“年青小伙子，一定是找姑娘们玩去了。”有一天午饭后，小队长悄悄跟在他后面去侦察他的秘密，这才发现他不是找姑娘们玩，而是到河滩上拣打洋灰用的石子去了。
    由于西北地区天然条件的限制，修路工人的生活是很艰苦的。就拿喝水来说吧，陇西县、定西县一带的水含有很多硷和硝，又涩又苦，吃了容易泻肚子。当地老百姓都是饮用头年藏入地窖的雪水。铁路工程队到那里的时候，已经来不及窖雪，不得不到几十里以外去运水。有时运输发生困难，苦水便成了唯一的饮料。但是他们为了节省运费，常常在找到一处含硷和硝比较少的水源之后，就不让汽车去运水。这样，仅仅第一工程队就节省了十亿元的运水费。
    工程队是经常流动的，只能住在帐篷里。在这丛山峻岭的高原地带，一早一晚气候的变化很大。夏天的中午，帐篷在太阳直射下，简直像个大蒸笼，温度最高达摄氏四十五度。但一到晚上，盖着棉被睡觉还嫌冷。冬天，最冷的时候，温度降到零下十八度，帐篷上的霜都结成厚厚的一层冰。工人们的手冻裂了，脚冻肿了，但是他们想到的不是自己受冻，而是怕严寒影响了工程质量。打洋灰时他们想办法用干草把打洋灰的模型包扎起来，用热水搅拌洋灰，这样，就可以一口气在冰天雪地里轮流打二十几个钟头，工程质量不受一点影响。
    尽管工作紧张，生活艰苦，工人们却把建设祖国当作最大的光荣和最大的快乐。每当傍晚时分，山坡上到处都是歌声。秦腔、广东小调、河南坠子、京戏和篮球司令的哨声，交织成一片。其中有一支嘹亮的歌声时常盖过了一切，长久长久地在起伏的山峦中振荡着：
    “为了建设新中国呀，不怕艰苦不怕难。力气好比清泉水呀，取不尽来用不完。”
    修筑天兰铁路的工人们，就以这样的英雄气概把最坚实的山凿通了，把几十丈深的山谷填平了，使道轨提前十个月从天水铺到了兰州。
