    We Will Fight Bravely and Study Hard
    Respected People of the Motherland: On "August 1st," we were celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army when we happened to receive the gifts you sent to express your regards. These gifts included towels, socks, soap, toothbrushes..., many kinds, and I alone received five items. In one of the gift bags, there was a pair of cotton socks, two pencils, stationery, envelopes, and a sewing kit. I also looked at the notebooks that other comrades received, some of which even had phonetic symbols written inside. You have really thought of everything, not only caring about our lives but also about our cultural studies!
    Dear compatriots, we guarantee that we will never fail to live up to your meticulous care. We will not fear any difficulties or hardships, and we will complete our combat missions and also seize the time to study hard.
     Lü Xiangwen, Eighth Platoon, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers

    我们一定英勇战斗、努力学习
    敬爱的祖国人民：“八一”那天，我们正在庆祝中国人民解放军建军节二十五周年，碰巧收到你们送来的慰问品。这些慰问品中有毛巾、袜子、肥皂、牙刷……，种类很多，光我一个人就分到了五样。在一个慰问袋中，有一双线袜、两支铅笔和信纸、信封，还有一个针线包。我又看了看别的同志分到的日记本，有的里面还写着注音符号。你们想的真周到，不但关心我们的生活，还关心着我们的文化学习呀！
    亲爱的同胞们，我们保证绝不会辜负你们这种体贴入微的关心，我们一定不怕任何艰难困苦，完成战斗任务，并且还要抓紧时间努力学习。
