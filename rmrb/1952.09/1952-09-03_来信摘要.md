China National Department Store Decides to Strengthen Supply and Sales Work for Troops Stationed in Rural Areas

    I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, our living standards have gradually improved, and comrades have the means to purchase various daily necessities. However, we are stationed in rural areas and have to go to towns far away to buy things. This not only means that some urgently needed items cannot be purchased in time, but also wastes manpower and incurs extra travel expenses. Therefore, I suggest that the national trade departments find ways to help us solve this difficulty.
    Lu Kaoyun

    Editor's Note: After receiving Comrade Lu Kaoyun's letter, we immediately contacted the China National Department Store. The China National Department Store has now notified its branches across the country to periodically send sales teams to locations where troops are concentrated to arrange for supplies.

When Sending Gifts or Letters of Condolence to the Volunteers, Please Specify the Return Address

    I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers. We often receive gifts and letters of condolence from the people of the motherland. This makes us feel infinitely excited. We are very willing to write back to them, reporting on the situation on the Korean front and expressing our love for the motherland and our determination to defend it. However, some people do not specify a return address when sending gifts and letters of condolence, making it impossible for us to reply. Therefore, I suggest that you convey my opinion to the people of the motherland, hoping that they will always write their address when writing to us in the future.
    Volunteer Soldier Bai Faming, of a certain unit

The Phenomenon of Excessive Official Documents, Forms, and Meetings Should Be Corrected

    We recently went to Baliyang Township, Suiping County, Henan Province, to work, and found that local township cadres were very troubled by the upper-level government's situation of "too many official documents, too many forms, and too many meetings." According to statistics, before mid-July this year, the township received a total of 114 official documents and 57 kinds of statistical forms. Some statistical forms are very complex, including 40 or 50 items, which are very difficult to fill out; some are unnecessary, but must also be filled out; some districts already have the figures, but townships are still asked to fill them out; some issues that should be subject to in-depth investigation and research, such as the situation of typical mutual aid groups, are also required to be filled out on forms. In the past six months, the meetings held in various tasks include 36 expanded township cadre meetings, 146 township government committee meetings, and even more small meetings that are difficult to calculate. The meeting time is as short as half a day, and as long as from early morning to midnight, just as the township cadres said: "Big meetings every three, six, nine days, small meetings every day." This situation has already made the township cadres exhausted and unable to do their jobs well, and has even more seriously affected production. We suggest that the Suiping County People's Government pay attention to correcting this phenomenon.

Errors in the Work of the Minquan County Farm Should Be Corrected Immediately

    The Minquan County State-owned Farm in Henan Province is located in Huzhuang Township of the county. This farm covers an area of ​​15 to 16 *qing* (approx. 240 acres), but it only has ten staff members. Since they cannot cultivate it all, they lease out about 11 *qing* of land, and cultivate 3.5 *qing* of land in partnership with the masses. They do not do agricultural experimental research work, and the task of popularizing improved seeds is very small. They only cultivate more than 130 *mu* (approx. 21 acres) of land themselves, and this year's harvest is not as good as some local farmers. The masses are very dissatisfied with this situation, saying that the farm is a "new-style landlord," "occupying the land and wasting it." We believe that the Minquan County People's Government should pay attention to this issue and earnestly study and improve the work of the county farm.
    Gongan, Luo Ge

    Editor's Note: State-owned farms are socialist agricultural enterprises. They must become models for guiding farmers to gradually move towards agricultural collectivization and science. The Minquan Farm's leasing of land and partnering with the masses is an erroneous act that violates policy. The Minquan County People's Government should immediately inspect and improve the farm's work.

Beijing People's Broadcasting Station Improves Literary and Artistic Broadcasting Programs

    The literary and artistic programs of Beijing's radio stations have made great achievements in meeting the cultural needs of the general public. However, the performers in some literary and artistic programs are not very serious in their performances. For example, a certain actor's *xiangsheng* (comic dialogue), although the content is new, he is still being glib, looking for cheap laughs, and seizing "gags"; so that the masses are not educated, but instead are given a very bad impression by the audience. For another example, when a certain actor sings *danxian paizi qu* (a type of traditional ballad), he has to say a lot of nonsense every time he changes a tune, and even openly says, "Saying nonsense is not enough to fill the hour."
    In order to enable literary and artistic programs to better educate the masses, I suggest that Beijing's radio stations earnestly listen to the opinions of the audience, check the broadcasting effects, and strengthen the education of the performers.
    Wu Xingmin

    Editor's Note: Comrade Wu Xingmin's suggestion is correct. The Second and Third Stations of the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station have paid attention to this issue and taken concrete improvement measures. They summarized their past work in July, comprehensively checked and studied the previous programs, and washed out individual performers who were extremely unserious in their performance attitude and refused to correct themselves. They have stipulated that in the future, the content of literary and artistic programs will be reviewed in advance, and have established systems such as key inspections and regular research to strengthen contact and education with performers. They hope that the audience can tell them their opinions on the literary and artistic programs at any time to help them improve their work in a timely manner.

China National Pharmaceutical Company Beijing Branch Accepts Reader's Suggestion to Purchase Empty DDT Bottles

    The DDT bottles produced by the China National Pharmaceutical Company Beijing Branch have the company's name printed on them, but the company does not purchase the empty bottles. I think this will not only easily enable some illegal merchants to pass off inferior DDT in the name of the company, but also does not conform to the principle of increasing production and practicing economy. I suggest that the company should find a way to purchase empty bottles.
    Tian Qingyuan

    Editor's Note: After receiving reader Tian Qingyuan's letter, we immediately contacted the China National Pharmaceutical Company Beijing Branch. The company accepted Comrade Tian Qingyuan's suggestion and decided to purchase the empty DDT bottles produced by the company.

All Pharmaceutical Factories Should Indicate the Manufacturing Date and Expiration Date on the Drug Packaging

    Some medicines sold on the market now do not indicate the manufacturing date and expiration date, and patients may buy medicines that have lost their efficacy. Therefore, patients not only waste their money on medicine, but also hinder treatment. I suggest that the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government notify all pharmaceutical factories across the country to indicate the manufacturing date and expiration date on the drug packaging to avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks.
    Hua Yi, Zhang Zhihe

    Editor's Note: The suggestions of Comrades Hua Yi, Zhang Zhihe, and others are correct. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has attached importance to this issue. In addition to asking the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government to notify local pharmaceutical factories to add the manufacturing date to the instructions for the prepared medicines, a clear stipulation will also be made in the new "Provisional Regulations on the Management of Prepared Medicines" to be promulgated soon.

It is Recommended That Farmers in Various Localities Catch and Eliminate Harmful Birds to Avoid Losses to Crops

    Birds such as crows and sparrows are very harmful to crops. These birds reproduce quickly and fly in groups to peck at crops, causing great losses to farmers. In order to win greater victories in the patriotic production increase movement, we suggest that the people's governments at all levels educate peasant brothers to use methods such as destroying nests and catching and shooting to eliminate these harmful birds.
    Wang Hongdong, Wang Kuan

    来信摘要
    中国百货公司决定加强对驻农村部队的供销工作
    我是人民解放军的一个战士。“三反”“五反”运动后，我们的生活水平逐渐提高了，同志们有条件购买各种日用品。但是，我们驻在农村，买东西还得到很远的城镇去。这样，不但有些急需用的东西不能及时买到，也浪费人力，多花路费。因此，我建议国家贸易部门设法帮助我们解决这个困难。
    卢考云
    编者按：我们接到卢考云同志的来信后，当即和中国百货公司联系。现中国百货公司已通知全国各分支公司，定期派遣销货小组到驻军集中地点，联系供应。
    给志愿军寄慰问品或慰问信时希望写明回信的通讯处
    我是中国人民志愿军的一个战士。我们经常收到祖国人民的慰问品和慰问信。这使我们感到无限的兴奋。我们十分愿意给他们写回信，报告我们在朝鲜前线的情况和表达我们热爱祖国的心情、保卫祖国的决心。但是，有些人寄来慰问品和慰问信时没有写明通讯处，使我们无法回信。因此，我建议你们把我的意见转达给祖国人民，希望今后给我们来信时一定写上自己的通讯处。

    应该纠正公文、表格、会议过多的现象
    我们最近到河南省遂平县八里杨乡去工作，发现当地乡干部对上级政府“公文多、表格多、会议多”的情况很感头痛。据统计，今年七月半以前，该乡共收公文一百十四件，统计表格五十七种。有些统计表格非常复杂，包括了四、五十个项目，很不容易填写；有些是不必要的，也要填表；有些区里已有数字，也要叫乡里填；有些应该作深入调查研究的问题，像典型互助组情况等，也让填表。半年来在各项工作中所开的会议，计扩大乡干部会议三十六次，乡政委员会一百四十六次，其他小型会议更难计算。开会时间短者半天，长者从清早到半夜，正如乡干部所说：“大会三六九，小会天天有。”这个情况，已经使乡干部疲于奔命，无法做好工作，更严重地影响了生产。我们建议遂平县人民政府注意纠正这种现象。

    民权县农场工作有错误应即改正
    河南省民权县县立农场，设在该县扈庄乡。这个农场占地十五、六顷，但只有十个工作人员，种不过来，就把十一顷左右的土地出租，三顷半土地与群众伙种。他们既不做农业试验研究工作，推广良种的任务也很小，自己只种了一百三十多亩土地，今年的收成还不如当地某些农民。群众对这种情况都很不满意，说农场是“新式地主”，“占着地糟践”。我们认为，民权县人民政府应该注意这个问题，认真研究、改进县立农场的工作。
    公安　洛葛
    编者按：国营农场是社会主义性质的农业企业。它必须成为引导农民逐步走向农业经营集体化和科学化的模范。民权农场出租土地和与群众伙种，是违反政策的错误行为，民权县人民政府应立即检查并改进该场的工作。
    北京市人民广播电台改进文艺广播节目
    北京市各广播电台的文艺节目，对满足广大市民文化生活的要求是有很大成绩的。但是，有些文艺节目的演出者在演出时态度很不严肃。如某演员的相声，内容虽然是新的，但演出时却耍贫嘴、找便宜，抓“哏”；以致不能使群众受到教育，反而给听众以很恶劣的印象。又如某演员演唱单弦牌子曲时，每换一个曲牌要说一大堆废话，还公然说：“不说废话凑不足钟点。”
    为了使文艺节目能更好地教育群众，我建议北京市各广播电台认真听取听众意见，检查广播效果，并加强对演出者的教育。
    吴兴民
    编者按：吴兴民同志来信提出的意见是正确的。北京市人民广播电台第二、三台已经注意了这个问题，并采取了具体的改进措施。他们在七月份总结了过去的工作，对以往的节目进行了全面的检查和研究，并洗刷了个别演出态度极不严肃而拒绝改正的演出者。他们规定了今后对文艺节目内容的事先审查的办法，和建立了重点检查和定期研究等制度，加强对演出者的联系与教育。他们希望听众能够把对文艺节目的意见随时告诉他们，帮助他们及时改进工作。
    中国医药公司北京市公司接受读者建议收购滴滴涕空瓶
    中国医药公司北京市公司出品的滴滴涕瓶子上制有该公司名称的字样，但该公司却不收购空瓶。我想，这不但易使某些不法商人以劣质滴滴涕冒名顶替，也不符合增产节约原则。建议该公司应设法收购空瓶。
    田庆元
    编者按：我们接到读者田庆元的来信，当即和中国医药公司北京市公司联系。该公司接受田庆元同志的建议，决定收购该公司出品的滴滴涕空瓶。
    各制药厂应在药品包装上标明制造年月和有效日期
    现在市上出卖的某些药品，没有说明制造年月和有效期限，病人很可能买到失了时效的药品。因此，病人不但白花药费，并且有碍治疗。我建议中央人民政府卫生部通知全国各制药厂，在药品包装上标明制造年月和有效期限，以免发生上述弊端。
    华　义　张志和
    编者按：华义、张志和等同志的建议是正确的。中央人民政府卫生部已经重视这个问题，除已请中央人民政府轻工业部通知各地药厂在出品的成药说明书上加注制成日期外，并在即将公布的新的“成药管理暂行条例”中再作明确规定。
    建议各地农民捕除害鸟以免庄稼遭受损失
    乌鸦、麻雀等鸟类，对庄稼危害很大。这些鸟类繁殖很快，成群飞来，啄食庄稼，使农民受到很大损失。为了争取爱国丰产运动的更大胜利，我们建议各地人民政府教育农民兄弟用倒巢、捕打等方法，除灭这些害鸟。
