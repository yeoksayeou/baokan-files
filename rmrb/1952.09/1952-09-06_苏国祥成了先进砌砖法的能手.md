    Su Guoxiang Becomes Skilled at Advanced Bricklaying Methods
    Chen Ji
    The workers at the Northeast Institute of Technology construction site in Harbin have all adopted the Su Changyou bricklaying method. At the end of August, I visited this construction site. At the bricklaying area, Su Guoxiang, a bricklayer in his forties, was leading four apprentices, briskly using the double-handed mortar squeezing method to lay red bricks. They started laying the first layer of wall in the morning, and by the afternoon, the wall was over one person tall. I heard that Su Guoxiang was a model team leader. I wanted to ask him what difficulties he encountered in implementing the double-handed mortar squeezing method. I approached the wall, and Su Guoxiang, holding a brick in one hand, looked at me with a smile: "What is it, comrade?" I asked him, "Is using the double-handed mortar squeezing method strenuous?" "Not strenuous at all, it saves much more effort than the old method." As he spoke, he laid two bricks. I asked him again, "Is double-handed mortar squeezing really better than the old method?" He replied very decisively, "Comrade, is there even a question! Using the double-handed mortar squeezing method is fast and good. Each person can lay more than two thousand bricks a day, earning fifty to sixty thousand yuan. National construction is fast, personal income is high, how can this not be good? Using the old method, people were exhausted, and still couldn't lay as many bricks, each person could lay at most eight or nine hundred bricks a day." I said, "That's right! Why are there still people who don't use the double-handed mortar squeezing method?" He laughed, as if he had a lot of experience with this question. He paused for a moment and only said one sentence: "Their thinking is flawed!" He didn't continue, and went back to laying bricks. I was about to ask him again when a young worker ran over and told me, "Master Su has also had flawed thinking, he has already made a self-criticism." This young worker, named Yang Dexuan, is an activist in Su Guoxiang's team. He narrated at length a story about Su Guoxiang learning the advanced bricklaying method.

    Last year, the Su Changyou team visited the Harbin Flax Factory to see a demonstration of the Soviet advanced bricklaying method. Su Guoxiang also went to visit. After the visit, Su Changyou began to implement the advanced bricklaying method, and was praised by the superiors. Su Guoxiang was unconvinced, thinking, "Who does Su Changyou think he is? I know his skills inside and out. Let him implement it, I won't implement it anyway, and I'll still surpass him." Su Guoxiang worked in the same place as Su Changyou. He saw that Su Changyou didn't have any particularly brilliant skills, nor was he anything special. He felt that with his twenty years of experience, "Isn't he worth more than Su Changyou?" "Su Changyou has one pair of hands, I have two pairs of hands, why should I humbly learn from others' experience like him?" He discussed it with all the members of his team and decided to compete with Su Changyou using the old method, "To see whose technique is better?" He led the entire team to lay bricks according to the old rules, without changing the labor organization, attempting to use "individual work" to defeat collective labor. At the time, someone advised him, "How can you win against collective labor by working alone?" He didn't listen, and instead said, "What individual work or not, I've been working alone for half my life, and no one has ever said I'm not good!" When he saw that the Su Changyou team was implementing the three-stage bricklaying method, which increased bricklaying efficiency, he was still unconvinced, always thinking, "If I can't surpass him, I'll lose too much face!" He and all the members of his team secretly started work an hour early every day, and didn't rest at noon. He thought that extending working hours could increase the number of bricks laid. Everyone in his team was exhausted after work every day, suffering from headaches and backaches, and couldn't even eat dinner. As a result, he failed. Every time the number of bricks laid was calculated, Su Guoxiang's team always laid several hundred fewer bricks than Su Changyou's team. When the quality of the project was inspected, their quality was poor, and they were criticized. At this time, Su Guoxiang finally admitted his mistake. He accepted this lesson and began to humbly learn the three-stage bricklaying method. This year, the superiors called for the adoption of the double-handed mortar squeezing method, and he took the lead in learning it, quickly mastering the technique of double-handed mortar squeezing.

    After telling this story, Yang Dexuan told me, "There are quite a few people like Master Su here! They rely on their own skills and are unwilling to learn from others' experience; they think that learning from others is a shameful thing. Therefore, their skills don't improve quickly. As long as their thinking is correct, they will learn quickly."

    苏国祥成了先进砌砖法的能手
    陈迹
    哈尔滨东北工学院工地的工人们都采用了苏长有砌砖法。八月底，我去访问这个工地。在砌墙的地方，四十多岁的瓦工苏国祥带领四个徒工，轻快地用双手挤浆的方法，砌着红砖，上午开始砌第一层墙，下午就把墙砌成一人多高了。我听说苏国祥是个模范小组组长。我想问他实行双手挤浆法有什么困难。我走近墙边，苏国祥一手拿着一块砖，笑眯眯地望着我：“有什么事？同志。”我问他：“使用双手挤浆费劲吗？”“不费劲，比旧办法省劲多啦。”他说着，就把两块砖砌好了。我又问他：“双手挤浆真比旧办法好吗？”他很干脆地答道：“同志，这还用问吗！用双手挤浆，又快又好，每人每天能砌两千多块砖，能得五六万元的工资。国家建设快，个人收入多，这怎么不好呢？使用旧办法，累得人够呛，还砌不出砖数来，每人每天顶多砌八九百块。”我说：“对呀！为什么还有人不用双手挤浆呢？”他笑了，好像对这个问题很有体会。他停了一会，只说了一句：“思想有毛病呗！”他没继续说下去，就去砌砖了。我正想再问他，忽然有个年轻工人跑来跟我讲：“苏师傅也有过思想毛病，他已经检讨啦。”这个年轻工人名叫杨德萱，是苏国祥小组里的积极分子。他滔滔不绝地叙述了一段苏国祥学习先进砌砖法的故事。
    去年苏长有小组到哈尔滨亚麻工厂参观苏联先进砌砖法的表演，苏国祥也去参观了。苏长有参观之后，就开始实行先进砌砖法，受到上级的表扬。苏国祥不服气，心想：“苏长有他算个什么，他的那一手我还不清楚，让他实行吧，我反正不实行，也要超过他。”苏国祥和苏长有同在一起工作，他眼看苏长有并没有什么高明之处，也没有什么了不起的地方，他觉得凭他二十多年的技术，“还抵不上苏长有吗？”“苏长有有一双手，我有两只手，干吗要像他那样低声下气地学人家的经验呢？”他和全组组员商量，决定用旧方法和苏长有赛一赛，“看那一个技术行？”他领导全组按照老规矩砌砖，不改变劳动组织，企图用“单干”来战胜集体的劳动。当时有人劝他：“你单干，怎么能胜过人家大伙干呢？”他不听，反而说：“什么单干不单干，反正我单干了半辈子，也没人说我半个不行呀！”当他看见苏长有小组实行三段砌砖法，提高了砌砖效率之后，他还是不服气，总觉得：“超不过他，就太丢脸啦！”他和全组组员，每天偷偷地早上班一小时，中午又不休息。他以为延长工作时间，可以提高砌砖的数目。他们全组人每天下了班，精疲力竭，头痛腰酸，吃晚饭都吃不下。结果他失败了。在每次计算砌砖数目的时候，苏国祥小组总比苏长有小组少砌几百块。在检查工程质量时，他们的质量不好，又受到了批评。这时候，苏国祥才承认了自己的错误。他接受了这个教训，开始虚心学习三段砌砖法。今年上级号召采用双手挤浆法，他带头学习，很快就掌握了双手挤浆的技术。
    杨德萱讲完了这段故事，又告诉我：“像苏师傅这样的人，我们这里可不少哩！他们凭着自己有技术，不愿意学习别人的经验；以为向别人学习，是不光彩的事情。因此他们的技术进步不快。只要他们的思想对头了，学起来就快哪。”
