Xinhua News Agency Report:

By the end of this year, Xikang Province will successively implement ethnic regional autonomy or establish ethnic democratic joint governments in areas inhabited by or interspersed with over one million minority people. Thus, all areas inhabited by and interspersed with various ethnic minorities within Xikang Province will have fully implemented ethnic regional autonomy or established ethnic democratic joint governments.

The minority areas where regional autonomy will be implemented or ethnic democratic joint governments will be established before the end of this year generally include four types. First, in minority areas with larger areas and larger populations, such as the largest Yi people's settlement in the country—the Greater Liangshan area, and the Muli area where 100,000 Tibetan people live, autonomous regions equivalent to the special district level and county level will be established. Second, in areas where ethnic minorities live in Han-dominated areas or on the edge of Han-dominated areas, such as the small Tibetan settlements in Baoxing and Hanyuan counties within the Ya'an Special District of the province, autonomous people's governments at the district and township levels will be established. Third, in areas with a particularly large number of Han people within the already established larger autonomous regions, such as Luding County within the Tibetan Autonomous Region of the province, ethnic democratic joint governments will be established. Fourth, ethnic democratic joint governments will also be established in areas where several ethnic groups live together and joint governments have not yet been established, such as the Jinkuang area of Yanyuan. In total, this year will see the establishment of one autonomous region at the special district level, including seven at the county level, more than ten at the district and township levels, and three ethnic democratic joint governments at the county level.

In order to smoothly carry out the work of ethnic democratic governance, various preparatory tasks are currently underway. The Xikang District Committee of the Communist Party of China has trained and dispatched more than 300 cadres to work in the Liangshan area in August. The preparatory committee for the Liangshan Autonomous Region is also about to be formally established. Regarding the division of territories, the Xikang Provincial People's Government has consulted with local people and leaders with ties to the masses, and has submitted the results of the consultation to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

    西康省境内各少数民族地区推行区域自治或建立联合政府
    西康省在今年年底以前，又将在一百万以上少数民族人民聚居或杂居的地区，陆续实行民族区域自治或建立民族民主联合政府。这样，西康省境内所有的各少数民族人民聚居和杂居的地区就全部实行了民族区域自治或建立民族民主联合政府。
    在今年年底以前实行区域自治或建立民族民主联合政府的少数民族地区大体包括四种类型。第一、在地区较大、人口较多的少数民族聚居区，如全国彝族人民最大的聚居区—大凉山地区和十万藏族人民聚居的木里地区等，将成立相当于专区级和县级的自治区。第二、在汉族聚居区内或汉族聚居的边缘地区有少数民族聚居的区域，如该省雅安专区内的宝兴、汉源等县内区域很小的藏族聚居区，将成立区级和乡级的自治区人民政府。第三、在已经成立的范围较大的自治区内汉族特别多的区域，如该省藏族自治区境内的泸定县，将成立民族民主联合政府。第四、在几个民族杂居而尚未建立联合政府的地区，如盐源的金矿地区等，也将成立民族民主联合政府。总计今年将成立的有一个专区级、包括七个县级、十余个区级和乡级的自治区和三个县级的民族民主联合政府。
    为了顺利展开民族民主建政工作，目前各地正在紧张地进行各项准备工作。中国共产党西康区委员会已训练和调派了三百多个干部，在八月间进入凉山地区工作。凉山自治区的筹备委员会也即将正式成立。在地域的划分上，西康省人民政府已与当地人民和与群众有联系的领袖人物进行协商，并将协商结果呈报中央人民政府政务院。
