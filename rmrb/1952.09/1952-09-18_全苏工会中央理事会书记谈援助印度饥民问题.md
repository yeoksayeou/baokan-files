Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th: TASS reporter interviewed Solovyov, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, regarding the Soviet trade unions' aid to famine victims in Madras Province, India.

Solovyov said: It was reported not long ago that the Joint Committee for Aiding Famine Victims in the Andhra Region sent a telegram to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions requesting food and cash assistance for the residents of the region. At the request of the Joint Committee, the Presidium of the Council decided to provide assistance to the famine victims in the Andhra Region. The Soviet trade unions, representing the Soviet workers and all the people, decided to send 10,000 tons of wheat, 5,000 tons of rice, 500,000 cans of condensed milk, and 250,000 Indian rupees to the Joint Committee for Aiding Famine Victims in the Andhra Region.

The Soviet ships carrying the above-mentioned food are currently en route to India.

This fraternal assistance from the Soviet working people has aroused sincere and enthusiastic gratitude from the Indian people. The reply telegram from the Joint Committee for Aiding Famine Victims in the Andhra Region said:

“On behalf of the famine victims in the Andhra Region, we express our sincere thanks for your generous assistance and encouraging telegram. As the famine is becoming more severe, we request that you expedite the delivery of food and remit the cash.”

The peasants of Chalapalli village unanimously passed a resolution saying: “The news of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions providing great assistance to the famine victims in the Andhra Region fills us with joy. The participants of the meeting express their gratitude to the peace-loving Soviet people and extend their sincere respect to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the great Stalin.”

In a telegram dated September 5th, the Indian government stated that it considered it necessary to take responsibility for the distribution of food and cash assistance, or to entrust the Indian Red Cross with this task. At the same time, the Indian government, through its Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow, issued a statement: The Indian government will distribute this aid in the disaster area according to the wishes of the Soviet trade unions.

Solovyov said: The only hope of the Soviet trade unions in donating food and cash is to help famine victims without any political considerations. The Soviet trade unions felt that it would be natural to give their assistance to the group requesting assistance, namely the Committee for Aiding Famine Victims in the Andhra Region. However, the Soviet trade unions do not object to taking other methods to distribute the assistance they have given, as long as the assistance reaches the hands of those who deserve it.

In view of the urgent need for assistance by the residents of the disaster areas in India, and according to the statement by the Indian government that this assistance will be given to the residents of the disaster areas, the Presidium of the Central Council decided to send the food and cash to the Indian Red Cross for distribution to the famine victims in the Andhra Region and other regions of Madras Province.

The Soviet trade unions hope that their assistance will alleviate the plight of the famine victims in Madras Province.

    全苏工会中央理事会书记谈援助印度饥民问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：塔斯社记者曾就苏联工会援助印度马德拉斯省饥民一事访问全苏工会中央理事会书记索洛维耶夫。
    索洛维耶夫说：不久以前已经报道过：援助安得拉区饥民联合委员会曾致电全苏工会中央理事会，请求以食物和现金援助该区居民，理事会主席团应联合委员会的请求，决定给予安得拉区的饥民以援助。苏联工会代表苏联的工人和全体人民，决定送给安得拉区援助饥民联合委员会一万吨小麦、五千吨大米、五十万罐炼乳和二十五万印度卢比。
    装载着上述食品的苏联轮船目前正在开赴印度的途中。
    苏联劳动人民给予的这种兄弟般的援助引起了印度人民由衷而热诚的感谢。援助安得拉区饥民联合委员会的复电说：
    “我们代表安得拉区的饥民，对于你们慷慨的援助和令人鼓舞的来电表示诚挚的谢意。由于饥荒更趋严重，我们请求你们赶紧把粮食运来并把现款汇来。”
    查拉巴利村的农民一致通过决议说： “全苏工会中央理事会给予安得拉区饥民以极大援助的消息使我们满心感到喜悦。大会参加者对于爱好和平的苏联人民表示感谢，并向全苏工会中央理事会和伟大的斯大林表示由衷的敬意。”
    印度政府在九月五日的来电中说：印度政府认为必须对分发食品与现金援助一事负起责任，或者是责成印度红十字会处理此项工作。印度政府同时经由印度驻莫斯科代办发表声明：印度政府将按照苏联工会的愿望在灾区分发此项援助品。
    索洛维耶夫说：苏联工会赠送食品与现金时唯一的希望是援助饥民而不加以任何政治的考虑。苏联工会觉得把它们的援助给予请求援助的团体，即援助安得拉区饥民委员会，似乎是很自然的。但是苏联工会也不反对采取其他方式来分配它所赠送的援助品，只要这些援助品达到应得这些援助品的人们的手里就行。
    鉴于印度灾区居民迫切需要援助，同时据印度政府的声明说，这些援助将给予灾区居民，中央理事会主席团决定将食品与现金送给印度红十字会，以便分配给安得拉区和马德拉斯省其他地区的饥民。
    苏联工会希望它们的援助将减轻马德拉斯省饥民们困苦的处境。
