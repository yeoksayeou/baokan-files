Peace Envoys, Beijing Embraces You!
By our reporters collectively, written by Yuan Shuipai

"Peace Representative, welcome!" A girl with two bunches of bright red dahlias held high in her hands is running towards you. She is so happy, she shows her two rows of snow-white teeth, smiling happily and shouting, as if she can't wait to make her two small legs run faster, so she can pounce on you right away. She warmly welcomes you - welcomes you all, peace envoys from afar!

How old do you think she is? Eight? Nine? Even such a short life, more than half of it was spent in war. It is very likely that she was born in a smoke-filled tile-roofed house, and perhaps at that time, a bomb made by DuPont had already taken her mother's life. However, the Chinese people won, forever drove out the foreign invaders, overthrew Chiang Kai-shek, and eliminated the landlord class. Her motherland was liberated and became independent. Peace and happiness, like spring rain, nourished and fertilized China's cracked land, mixed with shrapnel and permeated with blood. With the emancipation of the people, our millions of children have since been freed from the scourge of hunger, wandering, and premature death. They began to live carefree lives in a new society, receiving noble moral education and growing up happily...

The red scarf fluttering on her chest marks the victory of this new life and her love for it. Peace representatives! When you accept her bouquet, you will easily be able to imagine some simple ideas in this little heart from her smile and her cry. Yes, they are simple, innocent, but humanity is worth fighting for them, and we have a responsibility to ensure that they are not destroyed. You will also easily be able to imagine from her lively figure her relatives and teachers, we Chinese people, how much we love our new generation! Imagine how strong and unwavering our will is to fight to defend their happiness!

This is a picture, one of the propaganda posters made by our artists who are fighting for peace for the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference. (See attached picture one) But it is also a common and true image that has appeared on the runway of the Xijiao Airport and the platform of the Qianmen Railway Station in recent weeks. Every day, Beijing children, holding flowers, welcome you peace representatives from more than 30 countries, with different skin colors and speaking various languages. When you step out of the plane or carriage, you see these lovely Chinese children, and you immediately smile and pick up these children to kiss.

Whether it is a Soviet female philosopher and poet, or a New Zealand housewife and bus driver; whether it is an Indian member of parliament and professor, or a Sri Lankan Buddhist and dockworker; whether it is an American engineer, women's activist, or a Vietnamese male and female guerrilla fighter... Beijing residents, all Chinese people, extend their arms to embrace you! We can unite closely because we have a common wish - peace. Our exchanges and harmonious conversations with each other have already alarmed the war instigators!

Early in the morning, Tiananmen Square gradually reveals its majestic posture from the light purple morning mist of autumn, and the sun shines on the golden patterns on the corners of the building. Beijing began its day's life. Pupils with schoolbags on their backs go to school, singing the song "People of the World are of One Heart"; Beijing people who love pigeons release snow-white pigeons, and the long and peaceful sound of "pigeon bells" echoes in the blue sky; Mass sounds are heard from various Catholic churches, and nuns and monks are praying for peace; workers from the Garden Office push water carts to water the lawns and cockscomb flowers on the flower beds in the middle of the road; stores everywhere hang bright red cloth curtains with golden slogans celebrating the convening of the peace conference on newly painted shop windows; tram drivers drive a new tram decorated with hundreds of peace doves out of the depot; construction workers apply the final coat of jujube-red powder to the palace walls on both sides of Tiananmen Square, reviving the youth of buildings hundreds of years old... Beijing is immersed in a festival-like excitement, and people welcome the peace conference with great hope.

Two and a half million citizens of the capital city have been looking forward to the holding of this significant conference for more than two months, and they are preparing everything for it. The sounds of hammers and shovels are resounding on construction sites, and the sounds of sifting sand and washing gravel echo far and wide. The ancient capital is rapidly changing its appearance.

The days are getting closer. The workers who built this venue are adding the final touch of gold to the Qianlong pattern of imitation Han jade at the entrance of the rostrum on wooden frames more than ten meters high; the electrical workers hang the last yellow silk palace lantern on the ceiling decorated with Dunhuang murals and installed with nine hundred hidden lights; the painted workers, who were rated as first-class models in this project, brush the last touch of emerald green on the last girder according to the "large gold spot" format of ancient Chinese architectural decoration; furniture workers transport the last of two thousand red velvet chairs... More than 5,000 workers basically completed the project that normally takes a year in just 75 days. This is a magnificent palace-style building that used 520 cubic feet of wood for doors, windows, and floors, 65 tons of iron bars, 12,000 bags of cement, 260,000 jin of lime, 900 cubic meters of stone, 1,500 cubic meters of sand, and 550,000 bricks. It can accommodate 1,500 people to meet spaciously; it is equipped with ventilation equipment that can exchange 40,000 cubic meters of fresh air per hour; each seat is equipped with headphones in eight languages; it can shoot sound movies and broadcast to the whole country; a stage four stories high with eight sky bridges can perform various dramas. This is a complex project, including every business in the construction field, with as many as 34 construction units. However, for peace, engineer Lin Leyi and artist Liang Sicheng completed the design work that originally required three months in half a month.

"We are not just working for 500 million people, we are working for 1.6 billion people." The workers encouraged each other with this sentence, and when they thought of this, they overcame all difficulties. The construction of the venue coincided with the rainy season in Beijing, and the workers worked in three shifts, day and night. They often worked in the rain and dark. Sometimes when they were working with their faces up, raindrops dripped into their eyes and mouths, and their bodies were soaked, but they never complained. They just thought about how to improve the bricklaying or plastering operation methods so that the representatives could meet here on time. Worker Liu Hongwen injured his foot with a tool. Comrades advised him to rest, but he still went to work on crutches every day. He said that for the sake of peace, this difficulty is nothing. He recalled that he had been an apprentice since he was 13 years old, suffered countless hardships, and suffered from the oppression of Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, he turned over and became the chairman of the trade union. Labor is no longer torture, but glory. Thinking of this, he felt the happiness of the new society even more, and he was determined to defend it and never let the enemy destroy it.

The days are getting closer. The workers who built the "Peace Hotel" for the representatives to live in swept away the last basket of shavings and sawdust, laid new carpets on the floor, and arranged pots of chrysanthemums in the courtyard. This project was originally scheduled to be completed in May next year, but it was all completed on September 15. Pan Wenqing, a 70-year-old worker who installed elevators, came from Shanghai to work. He said that he could have retired and lived in peace. He had three sons and three daughters-in-law, all of whom had jobs after liberation. He was already the old grandfather of four grandsons and five granddaughters, but for the sake of peace, he wanted to dedicate his technology. The elevator was hoisted from the roof. According to the principle of installing elevators, it can only be done after the top floor is built. In order to save time, this old worker from the Shanghai Otis company installed it layer by layer from the bottom to the top. The project that originally required eight months was completed in one month. The Otis company did not believe it when they heard it. As the engineer Yang Tingbao, who designed the "Peace Hotel," said, the workers completed a miracle. He had been engaged in construction for 20 years and had never seen such a thing. On the walls of the construction site, there were many competition plans and challenge letters. One of them read: "Sixth floor, September 6th" "Seventh floor, September 7th" "Eighth floor, September 8th" "Ballroom, September 10th" "Elevator, September 15th"... Although the paper of this slogan looks very fresh, indicating that it has just been posted recently, half of the paper has been covered by another newer paper, which reads:
"Celebration meeting will be held at 8 pm tonight..." For the sake of peace, the speed of the workers' work exceeded the pace of time.

The production of munitions makes the people of capitalist countries breathless, but the workers of the new China are working hard for peaceful construction. Four months ago, foreign peace representatives who visited the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory saw workers sending a batch of old guns into the iron melting furnace to be melted. They were very moved, and then they asked the workers if it was just this batch. The workers truthfully told them that this was the work that had been going on in their factory for a long time, and it was nothing special. Speaking, they led the representatives to the open space outside the workshop to see, where there was still a pile of various old guns, light and heavy machine guns, and shells. Next to these weapons, a row of new-style horse-drawn ploughs, painted brightly red, were being brushed with plough handles by paint workers. Workers create new records every day and every hour, but the production of new agricultural implements is far behind the needs of the vast rural areas of China. Not only can they not be sold retail, but the orders have already been placed until the end of 1953. The superior new democratic social system and the dying capitalist social system form a sharp contrast here. Capitalism can only continue its life by manufacturing munitions; but in our society, for the sake of peaceful construction, we have endless things to do and inexhaustible strength.

In this factory, Liu Shuqing, a young female worker in the screw group, cooperated with technicians to improve the tools in the production increase competition, making the utilization rate of Chinese-made taps exceed that of American goods, and increasing the output of screws more than three times than in the past. She said: "The times have changed. Peace representatives from dozens of countries have come to our country to hold meetings. I never thought about this in the past. Looking at myself and thinking of others, I also hope that the nations along the Asian and Pacific coasts who are being oppressed by imperialism can stand up like us. When I think of the lives of the people in those countries today, I think of my own past, and I want to contribute my share to the motherland and peace even more."

The factories of imperialist countries are manufacturing napalm bombs, and our factories are producing music. Workers in the People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory are printing "Grandma Wang Wants Peace" and "The Song of Defending Peace." The production plan for the record workshop this month is estimated to be completed three days ahead of schedule. In order to welcome the peace conference, young worker Li Ming improved the wiring method for assembling radios. Originally, a group of seven people assembled 70 units a day, but now six people can assemble 96 units. For the sake of peace, they want to send more radios to the countryside faster.

Our factories are producing pictures. In order to send exquisitely printed pictures and albums to the peace representatives, the workers of the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory are working overtime to complete 10,000 copies of the "New China Album", 50,000 copies of the foreign language "People's Pictorial", and 20,000 copies of albums exposing the bacteriological warfare crimes of the US government. Yang Changbao's lithographic team created a new record for retouching, reducing the time required for one plate from 280 hours to 124 hours. The workers of the business branch of the People's Printing Factory moved the factory while rushing to print propaganda posters for the peace conference representatives. Zhang Jingshan, the director of the offset printing workshop, pointed to a red "safe production" light at the door and said proudly that their entire workshop would continue to maintain this red light in order to serve the peace representatives this time. "These paintings are printed and sent to international friends. We want to ensure that they reach the highest quality." Workers at the private Zhenya Printing Factory are also working day and night to print New Year pictures such as "The Bride Speaks", preparing to send them to the peace representatives. Sun Guangrong, the director of the engineering department, used to only be responsible for checking ink colors and other work, but this time for the peace conference, he personally did the work of changing plates and wiping machines.

In order to welcome the peace conference, the slogan of completing production tasks ahead of schedule was sounded in every factory and workshop.

The housewives of Beijing are also enthusiastically dedicating their intelligence and hard work to welcome the peace representatives. Women in the Haidian and Xidan districts are making embroidered handkerchiefs to send to distant guests. They are all housewives and have children. As soon as they heard that a peace conference was going to be held, they naturally thought of the hard days of the past and the future destiny of their children. Mu Shuzhen is the mother of four children, three of whom are Young Pioneers. She said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao liberating us, where would we be today?" Her mother-in-law is already 74 years old, and in order for her daughter-in-law to do such important work, she specially replaced her to cook, so that she could free up time to do a good job. Tong Baozhen is also the mother of three children. She has been a female worker since she was a child and has suffered all kinds of oppression. She has only had a good life since liberation. She said: "We can no longer allow American imperialism and the reactionaries to re-invade us and oppress us!" She first coaxed her children to sleep every night, and then she kept embroidering until late at night. She said that after liberation, everyone understood the truth, even the old ladies' eyes lit up. Yes, she is right. There is an old lady in her sixties who used to embroider, but now her eyes are not working well. She has a niece who can embroider, but she happened to be in the countryside at this time. As soon as she heard that she was going to embroider handkerchiefs for the peace representatives, she was anxious and wanted to call her niece back from the countryside.

The housewives in Niurouwan, Xidan District, heard the news of the peace conference at the reading group on the 17th of this month. They were so happy that they decided to build archways to welcome the conference. On the spot, some people contributed money, raising 500, 1,000, and 2,000; some people contributed bamboo poles, red cloth, electric lights, and wires. The particularly active old lady Liu said that the two families at No. 1 and No. 3 in their alley lived next to each other, but they still didn't know each other after living together for more than 20 years. Since liberation, meetings have been held frequently. Not to mention the two families, the whole alley is as familiar as one family. Therefore, she thought that even though the people of many countries in the world are very far apart, if they can hold more meetings like this, wouldn't they also become as familiar as one family? Her daughter, who lives in the countryside, is about to have a baby, and she took out a piece of red cloth that she had originally prepared to give to her daughter as a gift. Recently, her daughter wrote to her asking her to go, and she wrote back to her daughter saying that she was too busy with things for peace and could not go.

Housewives made archways at the home of Xing Runzhen, the wife of a bank clerk. Cutting paper and sticking cloth, they were busy. Xing Runzhen's husband was sick in bed at this time. Hearing that the women were working hard, he was also moved and struggled to get up and write inscriptions for the archways. It is clearly written on the four archways welcoming the peace conference standing in Niurouwan today, "Established by the Masses." Every woman, every mother, deeply understands what peace means.

For suburban farmers, peace means a bumper harvest, winter school, busy farming nurseries, and new clothes. The director of the Women's Federation of Baiyanzhuang in the suburbs of Beijing said: "In the past three years, more than 200 young and middle-aged people in our village have become literate. This year, five women in the village have learned new methods of midwifery."

The days are getting closer. In order to welcome the peace conference and wish the conference a successful victory, the working people of Xicheng and part of the outside of the city gathered together after their hard work during the day and held lantern parades in the evening. Tricycle workers, wallpaper workers, bricklayers, young women, old ladies in their fifties who had just entered literacy classes... More than 2,000 people, holding their own paper peace dove lanterns and red star lanterns, shouted slogans and walked through a street full of applause. Look, doesn't the young woman in the team look like a bride? Yes, this dress is indeed what she prepared to wear at her wedding. Her name is Guan Shuqin, and her partner is a young vegetable vendor who studied the first volume of textbooks in the spare time school with her after liberation. After they got through their parents' feudal ideas, they got engaged. Before this parade, her companions advised her not to get such an important dress dirty. Guan Shuqin didn't listen and said, "Marriage is important, but peace is more important than marriage."

She is an ordinary Chinese woman. She may be called Guan Shuqin, or she may be called another name; she may be in a factory, or she may be in the countryside, or in a family. Anyway, no matter who she is, she loves peace wholeheartedly, and she has the determination and strength to stand with every ordinary Chinese people and with the people of the world who love peace to fight to defend peace! Just like the person depicted in a woodcut print made by our artist who is fighting for peace (see attached picture two), you can see her everywhere on the vast land of China. (Attached picture)

We sincerely love peace, by Yan Han

专栏：

    和平使者们，北京拥抱你们！
    本报记者集体采访  袁水拍执笔
    “和平代表，欢迎你！”一个双手高举两束鲜红的大丽菊的女孩子，正向你迎面飞奔过来。她是这样地高兴，她露出两排雪白的小牙齿，愉快地笑着，叫着，仿佛恨不得叫自己的两条小小的腿跑得更快些，好马上扑到你跟前来。她热烈地欢迎你——欢迎你们大家，来自远方的和平使者们！
    你看她有几岁？八岁？九岁？即使这样一段短短的生命，也有一大半是在战争里度过的。很可能，她是在一所硝烟迷漫的瓦房里生下的，也许就在那时，杜邦公司制造的炸弹已经夺去了她的母亲。但是，中国人民胜利了，永远赶走了外国侵略者，打倒了蒋介石，消灭了地主阶级。她的祖国解放了，独立了。和平幸福像春天的雨一样滋润着、肥沃着中国的干裂的、杂着弹片和渗透了鲜血的土地。随着人民的翻身，我们的千百万儿童也从此摆脱了饥饿、流浪和夭折的厄运。他们开始无忧无虑地生活在新的社会里，受着高尚的道德的教养，幸福地生长……
    她胸口飘着的这条红领巾，标志着这种新的生活的胜利，标志着她对这种生活的爱。和平代表们！当你们接受她的花束的时候，你们将很容易从她的微笑里，呼声里，想像出这小小心灵中的一些简单的意念。是的，它们是简单的，天真的，但人类值得为它们而奋斗，我们有责任要保证它们不受摧残和毁灭。你们也将很容易从她的活泼的身姿里，想像到她的亲人们和教师们，我们中国人民，对自己的新的一代是多么地爱！想像到我们为了保卫他们的幸福而斗争的意志，是多么坚强而不可动摇！
    这是一幅图画，是我们为和平而斗争的艺术家为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而作的宣传画之一。（见附图一）但这也是最近这几星期里，出现在西郊飞机场跑道上和前门火车站月台上的常见的真实形象。每天，北京儿童们怀抱鲜花，欢迎着你们肤色不同的，说着各种语言的，来自三十几个国家的和平代表。当你们跨出飞机或者车厢的时候，就看见这些可爱的中国儿童，你们立刻微笑着，抱起这些孩子来亲吻。
    不论是苏联的女哲学家、诗人，还是新西兰的家庭妇女、公共汽车司机；不论是印度的议员、教授，还是锡兰的佛教徒、码头工人；不论是美国的工程师、妇女活动家，还是越南的男女游击队员……北京的居民，全中国人民，都伸出手臂来拥抱你们！我们是可以紧密地团结起来的，因为我们有着共同的愿望——和平。我们彼此之间的来往与和谐的交谈，已经使战争挑拨者们惊惶失措！
    清早，天安门从秋天的淡紫色的晨霭里逐渐露出它的雄伟的姿态，阳光照耀着楼角上的金黄色的花纹。北京开始了它一天的生活。背着书包的小学生上学了，唱着“全世界人民心一条”的歌；爱鸽的北京人家放起雪白的鸽子，悠久而宁静的“鸽铃”声在蓝天回响；各个天主教教堂里传出做弥撒的声音，修女、修士们在为和平祈祷；园林事务所的工人推着水车，给马路中间花台上的草地和鸡冠花浇水；到处的商店把庆祝和平会议召开的金字标语的鲜红布幔，挂上新漆的橱窗；电车司机从车厂里开出了
    一辆缀满几百只和平鸽的新电车；建筑工人把天安门两边的宫墙抹上最后一道枣红粉彩，使几百年前的建筑物复活了青春……北京沉浸在节日似的兴奋里，人们怀着巨大的希望迎接着和平会议。
    二百五十万首都市民从两个多月前起就盼念着这个意义重大的会议的举行，他们为着它准备一切。建筑工地上响着锤子和铁锹的声音，筛砂子和洗石子的声音远近呼应着。古老的都城在急速地改变它的容貌。
    日子临近了。建筑这次会场的工人，在十几公尺高的木架上，给主席台台口的仿照汉玉的牵龙图案，添上最后一笔金色；电气工人把最后一盏黄绢的宫灯挂上那安装着九百只暗灯的、绘有敦煌壁画图案的天花板；在这次工程中评为一等模范的彩画工人，给最后一根桁梁，按照中国古代建筑装饰“大点金”的格式，刷上最后一抹翠绿；家具工人运来了两千把红丝绒椅子的最后一把……五千多工人在短短的七十五天中基本完成了平时需要一年的工程。这是一座用了五百二十立方尺门窗地板木材，六十五吨铁筋，一万二千袋水泥，二十六万斤石灰，九百立方公尺石块，一千五百立方公尺砂，五十五万块砖的宫殿式的壮丽建筑。这里可以宽敞地容纳一千五百人开会；这里装置着每小时可换四万立方公尺新鲜空气的通风设备；这里的每一个座位上装着八种语言的耳机；这里可以拍有声电影，可以向全国广播；有四层楼高、搭着八座天桥的舞台可以演各种戏剧。这是一个复杂的工程，包括建筑方面每一种业务，施工单位多到三十四个。但是，为了和平，工程师林乐义等和艺术家梁思成等把原需三个月的设计工作，提早到半个月就完成了。
    “我们不只是为五万万人工作，我们在为十六万万人民工作。”工人们用这句话互相鼓励着，想到这里，他们克服了一切困难。会场施工期间刚碰到北京雨季，工人们分三班轮换，日夜不停。他们常常冒雨摸黑地干。有时仰面做工，雨水滴到了眼里嘴里，周身淋湿，可是决不叫苦，心里想的只是怎样改进砌砖或是抹灰的操作方法，使代表们能够按时在这里开会。工人刘鸿文被工具打伤了脚。同志们劝他休息，可是他还是每天支着拐杖上工。他说，为了和平，这点困难不算什么。他回想自己十三岁起就当学徒，吃了无数苦，受尽日本侵略者和国民党反动派的压迫。解放以后，翻了身，当了工会主席。劳动再也不是折磨，而是光荣。想到这些，他更加觉得新社会的幸福，他决心要保卫它，永远不让敌人来破坏它。
    日子临近了。修建供代表居住的“和平宾馆”的工人，打扫掉最后一筐刨花和木屑，把新织的地毯铺在地板上，把一盆盆的菊花布置在庭院里。这原是要明年五月才能完成的工程，但九月十五日已经全部完成了。装电梯的七十岁老工人潘文清特地从上海跑来工作。他说，他原可以退休养老，他有三个儿子和三个媳妇，在解放后都有了工作。他已经是四个孙子和五个孙女的老爷爷，但为了和平，他要把他的技术献出来。电梯是从屋顶上吊下来的。按理装电梯，只能在最后一层楼盖好以后。为了争取时间，这个上海沃的斯公司的老工人这回却从楼下逐层装到楼顶去。原需八个月的工程，一个月里完成了，沃的斯公司听见了不相信。正如设计“和平宾馆”的工程师杨廷宝说的，工人们完成了奇迹，他自己干了二十年的建筑，从没有见过这样的事。在工地的墙壁上，贴着许多竞赛计划和挑战应战书。其中有一张这样写着：“第六层九月六日”“第七层九月七日”“第八层九月八日”“舞厅九月十日”“电梯九月十五日”……虽则看起来这张标语的纸张很新鲜，说明它还刚贴上不久，但是半张纸已经被另一张更新的纸盖上了，那张纸上写的是：
    “本日晚八时举行庆功大会……”为了和平，工人们工作的速度超过了时间的脚步。
    军火生产压得资本主义国家人民喘不过气来，新中国的工人却正在为和平建设而努力。四个月以前参观华北农业机械总厂的外国和平代表们，看见工人正在把一批旧枪炮送进熔铁炉里去化。他们很感动，接着，他们询问工人，是不是仅仅这一批。工人们照实告诉了他们，这是他们厂里已经进行了好久的工作，一点也不特别。说着，他们领代表们到车间外面的空场去看，那儿还堆着一堆各式旧枪炮、轻重机关枪和炮弹。就在这些武器旁边，一列一列油漆得鲜红夺目的新式的马拉犁农具，正在由油漆工人刷犁柄。工人们每天每时创造新纪录，但是新农具的生产还远远落后于中国广大农村的需要，非但不能门市零售，就是订货，也已经订到了一九五三年年底。优越的新民主主义社会制度与垂死的资本主义社会制度在这里形成了尖锐的对比。资本主义只能靠制造军火续命；但在我们的社会里，为了和平建设，我们有做不完的事情和用不尽的力量。
    就在这个厂里，螺丝组青年女工刘淑清在增产竞赛中，和技术人员合作改进了工具，使中国自制的丝锥的利用率超过了美国货，使螺丝的产量比过去提高到三倍多。她说：“时代变了，几十个国家的和平代表到我们国里来开会，这在过去，想也没想到。看看自己，想到别人，我也希望亚洲和太平洋沿岸正在受着帝国主义压迫的民族，能够像我们一样站起来。我想到那些国家人民的今天的生活，就想起自己的过去，也更加想为祖国为和平贡献自己的一份力量。”
    帝国主义国家的工厂在制造凝固汽油弹，我们的工厂在生产音乐。人民广播器材厂的工人在印制“王大妈要和平”和“保卫和平之歌”。唱片车间本月份的生产计划估计可以提早三天完成。为了迎接和平会议，青年工人李明改进了装配收音机的接线方法。原来一个小组七个人一天装七十架，现在六个人可以装九十六架。为了和平，他们要把更多的收音机更快地送到农村去。
    我们的工厂在生产图画。为了要把印刷精美的图片、画册送给和平代表，北京美术印刷厂工人正在提早完成一万册“新中国画册”、五万册外文的
    “人民画报”、两万册揭露美国政府细菌战罪行的画册等等任务。杨长宝平版小组创造了修版的新纪录，从一块版需要二百八十小时降低到一百二十四小时。人民印刷厂营业分厂的工人一面迁厂一面为和平会议代表赶印宣传画。胶印车间主任青年工人张景善指着门口的一盏“安全生产”红灯自豪地说，他们全车间为了这次给和平代表服务，要继续保持这盏红灯，“这些画印出去是送给国际朋友的，我们要保证达到最高的质量。”私营振亚印刷厂工人也在日以继夜地赶印“新娘子讲话”等年画，准备送给和平代表。工务长孙光荣过去只管检查油墨颜色等工作，这次为了和平会议，也亲自做换版和擦拭机器的事。
    为了迎接和平会议，每一个工厂每一个车间里响起了提前完成生产任务的口号。
    北京市的家庭妇女也在热烈地为迎接和平代表，献出自己的聪明和辛劳。海甸和西单区的妇女在做挑花手巾准备送给远方的客人。他们都是家庭主妇，都有孩子。她们一听到要开和平会议，就很自然地联想到过去的苦难日子，和孩子们的未来命运。牟淑珍是有四个孩子的母亲，三个都是少年儿童队员。她说：“要不是毛主席解放我们，哪有今天？”她的婆婆已经七十四岁，为了媳妇要做这样重要的活，特地代替她烧饭，让她腾出工夫来好好地干。佟宝贞也是一个有了三个孩子的母亲，她从小做女工，受尽压迫，解放以后才有好日子过。她说：“我们再也不能让美帝国主义和反动派重新来侵略我们，压迫我们！”她夜夜先把孩子哄着睡了，自己一直挑花挑到深夜。她说，解放后大家都明白了道理，那怕老太太们也亮了眼睛。是的，她说得对。有一个六十多岁的老太太，过去也挑花，现在眼睛不济事了。她有个侄女能挑花，可是这时候刚好在乡下。她一听到要给和平代表挑手巾，就干着急，一心想把自己侄女从乡下叫回来。
    西单区牛肉湾的家庭妇女们在本月十七日的读报组里听到了开和平会议的消息，她们高兴得不得了，决定要搭牌坊，来迎接这个会议。当场有的人出钱，五百、一千、二千地凑起来；有的人出竹竿、红布、电灯、电线。特别积极的刘老太太说，她们胡同里一号和三号两家住在紧隔壁，可是一起住了二十多年还是不相识。自从解放后，常开会，别说两家，就是整条胡同都熟得好像一家人了。因此，她想，世界上许多国家的人民隔得尽管很远，要是也能这样多开开会，不是也会熟得像一家人一样吗？她的住在乡下的闺女快要添孩子，她把原来准备给闺女送礼的一块红布，也拿了出来。最近女儿写信要她去，她回信告诉女儿说，为了和平，事情忙不过来，不能去了。
    家庭妇女们在一个银行职员的妻子邢润贞家里做牌楼。剪纸贴布，忙个不了。邢润贞的丈夫这时正病在床上，听得妇女们干得起劲，也感动得挣扎着起来给牌楼题字。今天立在牛肉湾的四个迎接和平会议的牌坊上写得很清楚，是“群众敬立”。每一个妇女，每一个母亲都深深地懂得和平是什么意义。
    和平对于郊区农民来说，是丰收，是冬学，是农忙托儿所，是新的衣服。京郊柏彦庄的妇联主任说：“三年来我们全村二百多青壮年都识了字，今年村上已经有五个妇女学会了新法接生。”
    日子临近了。西城和城外一部分的劳动人民为了迎接和平会议，预祝会议的胜利成功，在白天辛劳之后的晚上，集合起来，举行了提灯游行。三轮车工人、裱糊工人、泥瓦工人、青年妇女、刚上速成识字班的五十多岁的老婆婆……二千多人举着他们自己糊的和平鸽灯、红星灯，高呼口号，走过一片鼓掌的市街。你看，队伍里那个青年妇女穿得不像一个新娘吗？是的，这件衣服的确是她准备在自己结婚时穿的。她叫关淑琴，她的对象就是和她一起在解放后进业余学校读第一册课本的同学，一个青年菜贩。她们打通了父母的封建思想以后，他们订了婚。这次游行前，同伴们劝她别弄脏了这样一件紧要的衣服。关淑琴不听，说：“结婚紧要，可是和平比结婚更紧要。”
    她是一个中国的普通妇女，她可能叫关淑琴，也可能叫别的名字；她可能在工厂里，也可能在农村里，在家庭里。不管怎样，不论她是谁，她是衷心地爱和平的，而且她有决心，有力量，誓和每一个中国普通人民站在一起，和全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，为保卫和平而斗争！就像我们为和平而斗争的艺术家作的一幅木刻版画中所描画的这个人一样（见附图二），在辽阔广大的中国土地上，你可以到处看到她。（附图片）

    和平代表，欢迎你！  郁风、冯真作
