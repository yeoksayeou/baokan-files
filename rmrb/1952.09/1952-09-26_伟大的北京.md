The new China is advancing at an astonishing speed. How is the construction of the capital? What changes have taken place in the past three years, and what will it be like in the future?

People are primarily concerned about Tiananmen Square. The new China was declared here, and Chairman Mao inspects the troops here every National Day and May Day. This year, its appearance is completely new. This great building has not undergone large-scale repairs for more than two hundred years since it was rebuilt in 1689. When repairs were carried out in June this year, the old residents of Beijing knew from the tall scaffolding that the scale of the repairs was very large. Many elderly people said, "This is the first time in decades." Workers removed three shells from the west beam. Individual English letters can still be faintly seen on the shell. Judging from the ancient form of the shells, they were probably fired by the Eight-Power Allied Forces in 1900. Great Tiananmen, you have experienced two major fires and have been bombarded by imperialist shells. Today, the Chinese people have healed your wounds and will never allow imperialists to touch you again!

Huge scaffolding like that erected during the renovation of Tiananmen Gate can now be seen everywhere in Beijing. Here and there, new buildings are emerging one after another. Standing on the gate tower of Tiananmen and looking east, there was only the "Beijing Hotel" building standing alone. Now, a whole row of buildings has been built opposite it. The eight-story "Peace Hotel" was completed on September 14th, and is currently the tallest building in the city. It will first receive peace representatives from afar to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The new buildings in the suburbs are even more eye-catching, with factories, schools, and dormitories, row upon row, gradually expanding the scope of the urban area. The speed of construction is truly amazing. Qinghua University constructed a total of only 110,000 square meters of school buildings in forty years, but this year it has built more than 90,000 square meters. The new school buildings started construction in March this year and will be completed soon.

How many houses have been built in Beijing since liberation? Leaving aside factories, government offices, and schools for the time being, the dormitories for workers, staff, and students, and the housing for citizens alone, amounted to more than 24,700 rooms by the end of 1951, equivalent to more than 370,000 square meters, calculated at 15 square meters per room. The planned housing construction in 1952 is 900,000 square meters, which is almost three times the total of the past two years. Many people, especially workers who used to be crowded into low and dark small houses for generations, are now moving into new houses in large numbers. The People's Printing Factory is not small in scale and has a history of more than forty years, but until liberation, it had only dozens of dormitories. The newly built workers' dormitories in the past three years are nearly 1,500 rooms, which is many times more.

New construction projects are only one aspect. The People's Government has also spent a lot of effort in consolidating the original foundation.

Beijing originally had a very good river and lake system, with wide lake surfaces and complete river channels. It is hard to imagine what the situation would be like if a city did not have enough water. This shows that our ancestors already possessed very rich knowledge in urban construction. However, these lakes and rivers have been in disrepair for many years, and most of them have been silted up. When Beijing was first liberated, some people even planted rice on both sides of the Jin'ao Yu Dong Bridge between Beihai and Zhongnanhai. The People's Government saved the lives of these rivers and lakes. In the two years of 1950 and 1951 alone, the amount of silt dredged from rivers and lakes was more than 2.54 million cubic meters. One cubic meter weighs one ton, and if transported by a train car with a load of 30 tons, it would require 84,800 cars. If these cars were lined up, they would be more than 1,200 kilometers long, stretching all the way from Beijing to Hankou. In 1952, the People's Government dredged the reed ponds in Taoranting and Longtan in the south of the city, turning them into artificial lakes. They will become two beautiful parks.

In terms of sewers, Beijing originally had a very complete system. It has experienced nearly 600 years of history, but most of it has been silted up. Moreover, there are no engineering drawings, and no one knows the secrets of this underground system. The People's Government investigated these ditches, carried out dredging and renovation work, and restored their drainage function. In one renovation project, a donkey accidentally fell into the ditch and turned around three times before coming out, which shows how grand the scale was. In the past three years, the People's Government has also built nearly 80 kilometers of new sewers in the areas where the working people live, which is more than 30% of the original sewers, and the scale is even larger than the original ones.

In the past, Beijing was very famous for its large amount of garbage. In many places, the garbage hindered traffic, and in some places along the city walls, the garbage was piled up as high as the city walls. A lot of garbage was still relics of the Ming Dynasty. Now these historical dregs have been basically removed. In 1949, the People's Government cleared more than 800,000 tons of garbage. If transported by trucks with a load of 2 tons, it would require 400,000 vehicles.

In terms of transportation, Beijing originally had 190 kilometers of asphalt roads. In the past three years, the People's Government has built more than 140 kilometers of new asphalt roads, which is equivalent to 74% of the original roads. The vast majority of dirt roads have been renovated. The number of trams has increased from the original 23 to more than 120, and the number of buses has increased from the original 7 to more than 140.

In addition, the People's Government has also improved the supply of water and electricity. The number of people using tap water has increased from more than 600,000 before liberation to more than 1.5 million. The number of street lights has increased by 6,680, an increase of 61% compared to before liberation.

The situation of "uneven roads, dim lights, and unreliable telephones" before liberation is gone forever.

How will Beijing be built in the future? The Urban Construction Planning Committee is studying this issue. Our great ancestors laid an extremely good foundation for Beijing. On this basis, our People's Government will build it even greater and more beautiful.

In the history of urban construction in the world, Beijing has the most outstanding and glorious position. As early as 1369, it basically had its current scale. At such an early time, to build a city on such a large scale and with such careful planning, Beijing was unique in the world. Its central axis, from Yongdingmen to the Bell Tower, is about eight kilometers long from north to south, which is rare in the world. As for the scale of the river and lake system and the sewer system, we have already talked about it earlier.

Its street system is very suitable for the principles of modern urban construction, which is especially surprising. Its several main streets take the Forbidden City as the center and form three "ring roads", surrounded by very neat small hutongs. Although the small hutongs are still too narrow, the main roads are very wide. This planned and clear division of main streets and small alleys ensures that vehicles do not have to turn around in the small hutongs, but naturally speed along the main streets, which guarantees the quietness of the residential areas in the small hutongs. The principle of this street division system is still a new discovery in recent decades. Most of the ancient cities in Europe and America have developed from fortresses, and the streets are mostly curved and irregular. Now it is very difficult to transform these streets to form regular ring roads. However, as long as Beijing's streets are tidied up and improved, they can become the most modern street system. As for the buildings of the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven, etc., they have extremely high achievements in terms of architecture and art. They will still be a very valuable part of our capital.

The people of the new China will continue to carry forward the glory of our great ancestors, and will greatly exceed the level of our ancestors to build the new capital of the new country. In the past three years, a good start has been made.

The plan for large-scale construction of the capital has not yet been finalized. What we can say is that the scale will be expanded tenfold compared to the present. The current suburbs will all be included within the scope of the urban area. It will be constructed according to clear regional divisions. For example, the current southeast suburbs will become an industrial area. In this way, the frequent northwest winds in Beijing will not blow the factory smoke into the city, and the industrial sewage will not flow through the city. There is very little industry in Beijing. Vigorously developing industry and increasing the industrial population will be one of the characteristics of Beijing's construction in the future. In the past three years, we have restored and developed the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Mentougou Coal Mine, and other industrial and mining enterprises. In the future, many thick new chimneys will appear.

The construction of the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River will make the Yongding River serve Beijing obediently. At that time, Beijing's ships will sail directly to the Grand Canal. Small motorboats in the city can also travel from the moat to the Summer Palace. Water games will become one of the most interesting entertainments for people on Sundays.

Let us strive for this day to come soon.

    伟大的北京
    新华社记者  沈容
    新中国以惊人的速度前进着。首都的建设如何？三年来它有了什么改变，将来它要建设成什么样子？
    人们首先关心着天安门。新中国在这儿宣布成立，毛主席每年国庆节和五一节在这儿检阅队伍。今年它的面貌焕然一新。这个伟大的建筑从一六八九年重修以后，两百多年以来没有经过大规模的修理。今年六月间进行修理的时候，老北京一看那高大的台架，就知道这次修理的规模很不小。很多老年人说：“几十年来，这是第一次。”工人们从它西边梁上取出了三颗炮弹。弹壳上还隐约地可以看出个别的英文字母。从炮弹的古老形式看来，大概是一九○○年八国联军打进去的。伟大的天安门，你经历了两次大火，又遭受过帝国主义的炮弹轰击。今天中国人民治好了你的创伤，绝不允许帝国主义者再碰你！
    像修理天安门城楼时架设的那样巨大的台架，现在在北京到处都可以看到。这里和那里，新的建筑物一幢一幢地出现着。站在天安门的门楼上望东看，原来只有一座“北京饭店”大楼孤零零地站在那里，现在在它的对面筑起了一整排楼房。八层楼的“和平宾馆”在九月十四日落成了，这是全市目前最高的建筑。它将首先招待远道而来参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的和平代表。郊区的新建筑更是醒目，有工厂、有学校、有宿舍，一排一排，一幢一幢，逐渐把城区的范围扩大了。建设的速度实在惊人，清华大学四十年间修建的校舍全部只有十一万平方米，今年却修建了九万多平方米。新校舍在今年三月动工，不久就要完工了。
    解放以来，北京究竟修建了多少房屋呢？这里暂且不说工厂、机关、学校，仅是工人、职员、学生的宿舍和市民的住房，到一九五一年底止，就建筑了两万四千七百多间，以十五平方米为一间计算，合三十七万余平方米。一九五二年预定修建的住房是九十万平方米，几乎相当于过去两年总数的三倍。很多人，特别是从前几辈子拥挤在低矮和黑暗的小屋子里的工人们，现在大量地搬到新房子里去了。人民印刷厂的规模不算小，而且有了四十多年的历史，但是到解放时为止，一共只有几十间宿舍。三年来新建的工人宿舍将近一千五百间，该是多少倍呢？
    新建工程只是一个方面，人民政府还花了很大的力量整理了原有的基础。
    北京本来有很好的河湖系统，有宽阔的湖面和完整的河道。如果一个城市没有足够的水那情况是不堪想像的。这可见我们的祖先在城市建设方面已具备了很丰富的知识。但是这些湖泊河道长年失修，大部分淤塞了。刚解放的时候，北海和中南海之间的金鳌玉蝀桥的两侧，甚至有人种上了稻子。人民政府拯救了这些河湖的生命。仅在一九五○年和一九五一年两年内疏浚河道湖泊所掏挖的淤泥，就有二百五十四万多公方，一公方重一吨，如果以载重三十吨的火车箱运除，需要八万四千八百节车箱。这些车箱排列起来，长达一千二百多公里，可以一直从北京排到汉口。一九五二年，人民政府掏挖了城南的陶然亭和龙潭两处苇塘洼地，使它们成为人工湖。它们将变成两个美丽的公园。
    下水道方面，北京原来也有很完整的系统。经历了将近六百年的历史，但是大部分淤塞了。而且没有工程图，没有一个人知道这地下的秘密。人民政府调查清楚这些沟道，做了掏挖和整修的工作，使它们恢复了宣泄的作用。在一次整修工作中，有一只驴子失足掉在沟里，在里面打了三个转才出来，由此可见那规模多么宏大。三年来，人民政府还在劳动人民聚居的地方修建了将近八十公里的新下水道，相当于原有下水道的百分之三十多，而且规模比原有的更大了。
    北京过去的垃圾之多，曾经是十分有名的。很多地方的垃圾妨碍了交通，城墙边有的地方的垃圾堆得和城头一样高。很多垃圾还是明朝的遗物。现在这些历史的渣滓已经基本上除掉，一九四九年人民政府清除的垃圾达八十多万吨，如果以载重两吨的汽车运输，就需要四十万辆。
    在交通方面，北京原有一百九十公里柏油路，三年中，人民政府新建了一百四十多公里的柏油路，相当于原有的百分之七十四。绝大部分土路，都经过了翻修。电车已由原有的二十三辆增加到了一百二十多辆，公共汽车由原来的七辆增加到了一百四十多辆。
    此外，人民政府还改善了水电的供应。用自来水的人数已由解放前的六十多万人，增加到一百五十多万人了。路灯增加了六千六百八十盏，比解放前增加了百分之六十一。
    解放前“马路不平，电灯不明，电话不灵”的情况已一去不复返了。
    北京还将怎样进行建设？都市建设计划委员会正在研究这个问题。我们伟大的祖先给北京奠定了极为良好的基础。在这个基础之上，我们的人民政府将把它建设得更伟大更美丽。
    在全世界都市建设的历史上，北京有着最杰出最光荣的地位。早在一三六九年就大体上具备了现在的规模。在那样早的时候，以那样大的规模和那样周密的计划来修建城市，北京是全世界独一无二的。它的中轴线由永定门到钟楼，南北共长约八公里，是世界上稀有的。至于河湖系统和下水道系统的规模，我们在前面已经谈到了。
    它的街道系统很适合于现代化都市建设的原理，尤其使人惊奇。它的几条大街以故宫为中心，构成三个“环道”，四周是很整齐的小胡同。虽然小胡同还太狭窄，大马路却很宽畅。这种大街小巷的有计划地明确划分，使车辆用不着在小胡同里打转，而自然顺畅地在大街上疾驰，这就保证了小胡同住宅的安静。这种街道分工制的原理，还是近数十年来的新发现。欧美的许多古老城市大都由堡垒发展起来的，街道大都弯曲而很不规则。如今要想把这些街道加以改造，使它们形成有规则的环道，是一件极不容易的事。而北京的街道只要加以整理和提高，就能成为最现代化的街道系统。至于故宫、颐和园、天坛等等的建筑，无论从建筑上或艺术上都有极高的成就。它们仍将成为我们首都的极宝贵的一部分。
    新中国的人民将继续发扬伟大祖先的光辉，并且将大大超过祖先的水平来建设新国家的新首都，过去三年来，已经作了良好的开端。
    首都大规模建设的计划，现在还没有最后确定。我们可以说的是，那规模将比现在扩大十倍。现在的这些郊区都将包括在城区的范围之内。它将按照明确的区域划分来予以建设，比如现在的东南郊将成为工业区。这样北京常有的西北风就不致于把工厂的浓烟刮到市内来，工业上的污水也不致在城内流过。北京工业很少。大量发展工业，增加工业人口，将是今后北京建设的特点之一。三年来，我们恢复并发展了石景山钢铁厂、门头沟煤矿等等工矿事业，将来还将出现许多粗大的新的烟囱。
    永定河官厅水库的修建，将使永定河的水驯服地为北京服务。那时，北京的船只将直驶运河。市内小汽艇，还可以从护城河开到颐和园去，水上游戏，将成为人们星期天最有趣的娱乐之一。
    让我们争取这一天早日到来。
