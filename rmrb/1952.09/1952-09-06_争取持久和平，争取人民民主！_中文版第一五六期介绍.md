An introduction to the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 156, the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties:

The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 156, the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

The editorial in this issue is entitled "A Great Contribution to the Cause of Peace," celebrating the world-historically significant victory of the Soviet people – the opening of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. The editorial states: The completed Volga-Don Canal, the world's largest hydroelectric power stations – the Stalingrad and Kuibyshev hydroelectric power stations – as well as the Turkmen Main Canal, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, the South Ukraine Canal, and the North Crimea Canal, and other large-scale projects, all demonstrate the indestructible power of the Soviet state and prove the unparalleled superiority of the Soviet socialist system over the capitalist system. The socialist system is a social system that is free from the insurmountable contradictions of capitalism, abolishes the private ownership of the means of production, and has no exploitation of man by man. Only such a social system can accomplish such heroic feats as the huge hydraulic engineering projects currently being built in the Soviet Union. The editorial continues: The Soviet people's recent extraordinary victories and their remarkable achievements in building communism are a great contribution to the cause of peace and a testament to the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a policy of peace. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are increasingly clearly seeing that the entire policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, all the efforts of the Soviet people, are aimed at safeguarding and consolidating peace, and at strengthening the power of the Soviet state in all aspects and further developing its productive forces. Good people in all countries rejoice with the Soviet people for their victories and achievements, and they are increasingly confident in the power of the people and the inevitable victory of the cause of peace. The editorial concludes: Communist and Workers' Parties and all democratic organizations are working hard to publicize the achievements of the Soviet people on the front of peaceful labor. They are uniting the mighty army of peace supporters more closely, and they continue to win millions of selfless fighters to fight together to stop a new war and to thwart the aggressive conspiracies of the American and British imperialists.

This issue publishes an article by Zhivkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, entitled: "Struggle for the Socialist Transformation of Bulgarian Agriculture". Zhivkov said: The Bulgarian Communist Party, headed by Chervenkov, made extensive use of the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction, relied on the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and the effective cooperation of people's democratic countries, and finally achieved great victories in agricultural cooperation. Farmers participating in agricultural cooperatives have exceeded 52 percent of the total number of households, the cultivated land of agricultural cooperatives has accounted for 50.35 percent of the total cultivated land area, and the number of agricultural cooperatives has reached 2,738. Currently, grain-producing areas are basically under the cooperative system. Zhivkov continued: Agricultural cooperatives are developing as multifaceted undertakings, guaranteeing high incomes for their members while producing abundant agricultural products for the market. Last year, the state collected more than 70 percent of the total grain collected from the socialist sector of agriculture, of which 60 percent came from agricultural production cooperatives. Comrade Chervenkov said in his report to the Third Congress of the Fatherland Front: "We have basically solved the food problem." Zhivkov pointed out: "At the current stage of the socialist transformation of agriculture, our party is not in a hurry to accelerate the pace of collectivization, nor is it in a hurry to increase the number of agricultural cooperatives. Our current main task is to strengthen agricultural cooperatives, machine tractor stations and state farms organizationally, administratively and politically." Zhivkov said: While strengthening agricultural cooperatives, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government also care about individual farmers, helping them obtain good seeds, fertilizers, machinery, loans, and bonuses to encourage them to expand production and improve their living and cultural conditions, because the party regards today's individual farmers as tomorrow's members of agricultural cooperatives.

This issue also publishes an article by Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, entitled "Expanding the Struggle for Peace, Women's Rights and Children's Welfare," discussing the achievements of the recent Executive Committee meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Bucharest. After discussing the various resolutions adopted by the meeting, Vaillant-Couturier pointed out that the three tasks of saving peace, safeguarding women's rights, and saving children are closely related. The Women's International Democratic Federation must absorb more women and more peace fighters into its various organizations; it must strengthen the internal unity of the various organizations, which unite people of different beliefs and belonging to different classes, but who accept a program that can be agreed upon by all women, which is to defend the family and national independence, defend the rights of women and their children, and defend peace; to strengthen solidarity with those organizations that, for some reason, have not joined the Women's International Democratic Federation but are consistent with its goals; to strengthen solidarity with various trade union and cooperative organizations, and to strengthen solidarity with those organizations and public figures even if an agreement can only be reached on one issue. Vaillant-Couturier finally said firmly: We women who bear the next generation and account for half of all mankind are willing to take on the cause of peace and unite with all other peace supporters to persevere in the cause of defending peace to the end.

Other important articles published in this issue include "The British Economy Encounters a Crisis Due to Expanding Armaments" written by Gollan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In this article, Gollan elaborates on the decline of civilian industries and the decline in the living standards of the working people caused by the expansion of armaments in Britain, as well as the resulting trade difficulties. Gollan pointed out that the way to avoid economic depression and the danger of war is to unite the vast majority of the British people to fight against the policies pursued by the Conservative Party and right-wing Labour Party leaders, to fight against rearmament, to strive for peace, to demand higher wages, to demand work, and to demand the development of trade between the East and the West.

Under the title "New Achievements in Countries of the Camp of Peace, Democracy and Socialism," this issue reports on the completion of the second quarter production plans of the German Democratic Republic and various people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五六期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五六期已经出版。
    本期社论题为“对于和平事业的伟大贡献”，庆祝苏联人民的具有世界历史意义的胜利——列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河开航。社论说：已经完工的伏尔加河—顿河运河，世界上最大的水力发电站——斯大林格勒和古比雪夫水力发电站以及土库曼大运河、卡霍夫卡水电站、南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河等规模巨大的工程，所有这些都证明苏维埃国家的不可摧毁的威力，证明苏维埃社会主义制度比资本主义制度无比优越。社会主义制度是摆脱了资本主义不可克服的矛盾、取消了生产资料的私有制、没有人剥削人的社会制度，只有这样的社会制度才能完成如目前在苏联建造的巨大的水利技术工程这些英雄的业迹。社论接着说：苏联人民最近获得的非凡的胜利和他们建设共产主义的显著成就，是苏联对和平事业的一大贡献，是苏联始终如一地推行和平政策的证明。全世界亿万人民日益清楚地看到：苏联共产党和苏联政府的全部政策，苏联人民的一切努力，都是为了维护和巩固和平，为了在各方面加强苏维埃国家的威力，进一步发展它的生产力。各国善良的人们都和苏联人民一道，为苏联人民的胜利和成就而欢欣鼓舞，他们对于人民的力量、对于和平事业的必然胜利是越来越有信心了。社论最后说：共产党和工人党以及一切民主组织都努力宣传苏联人民在和平劳动战线上的成就，它们正在把强大的和平拥护者的大军更紧密地团结起来，它们继续赢得了千百万忘我的战士，一致为制止新战争而斗争，为挫败美英帝国主义者的侵略阴谋而斗争。
    本期刊载了保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记日夫科夫的一篇文章，题目是：“为保加利亚农业的社会主义改造而斗争”。日夫科夫说：以契尔文科夫为首的保加利亚共产党，广泛利用苏联的社会主义建设经验，依靠苏联的兄弟般的援助和人民民主国家的有效合作，终于在农业合作事业上取得了巨大的胜利。参加农业合作社的农民已超过总户数的百分之五十二，农业合作社的耕地已占总耕地面积的百分之五十一点三五，农业合作社的数目已达二千七百三十八个。目前产粮区基本上已属于合作社制度。日夫科夫接着说：农业合作社是作为多方面的事业而发展的，它为社员保证了很高的收入，同时为市场生产了丰富的农产品。去年国家从农业的社会主义部分征收的公粮占征收总额的百分之七十以上，其中有百分之六十来自农业生产合作社。契尔文科夫同志在他向祖国阵线第三届代表大会所作的报告中说：“我们已基本上解决了粮食问题。”日夫科夫指出：“在农业的社会主义改造的现阶段，我们党并不急于加速合作化的步调，并不急于增加农业合作社的数目。我们当前的主要任务是：在组织上、行政上和政治上加强农业合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场。”日夫科夫说：保加利亚的共产党和政府在加强农业合作社的同时，还关心着个体农民，帮助他们取得优良的种子、肥料、机器、贷款，和奖金以鼓励他们扩大生产并改进他们的生活条件和文化条件，因为党把今天的个体农民当作明天的农业合作社社员。
    本期还刊载了国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦扬—古久里夫人所著“扩大争取和平、妇女权利和儿童福利的斗争”一文，论述最近在布加勒斯特举行的国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会会议的成就。瓦扬—古久里夫人在论述了会议所通过的各项决议以后指出：拯救和平、维护妇女的权利和拯救儿童这三项任务是互相密切关联的，国际民主妇女联合会必须吸收更多的妇女、更多的和平战士加入它的各个组织；必须加强各个组织内部的团结，这些组织团结了具有不同信仰、属于不同的阶层、但接受能为全体妇女同意的纲领的人，这个纲领就是保卫家庭和祖国独立、保卫妇女和她们的儿童的权利，保卫和平；对于那些因某种原因没有参加国际民主妇女联合会、但与它的目标一致的组织，要加强与它们的团结；要加强与各个工会及合作社组织的团结，对于那些即使在一个问题上可能达成协议的组织和社会人士也要加强与他们的团结。瓦扬—古久里夫人最后坚定地说：我们这些生育下一代、占全人类半数的妇女愿意把和平事业担当起来，并且与所有其它和平拥护者联合起来把保卫和平的事业坚持到底。
    本期刊载的其他重要文章有英国共产党政治局委员高兰写的“英国经济因扩张军备而遭遇危机”。高兰在这篇文章里面详尽地论述了英国由于扩张军备所造成的民用工业萎缩和劳动人民生活水平的下降，以及因此而产生的贸易方面的困难。高兰指出，避免百业萧条和战争危险的办法，就是联合英国最大多数的人民，为反对保守党和右翼工党领袖所奉行的政策而斗争，为反对重新武装而斗争，为争取和平、要求提高工资、要求工作、要求发展东方与西方的贸易而斗争。
    本期在“和平、民主与社会主义阵营国家的新成就”的标题下，报道了德意志民主共和国和东欧各人民民主国家完成第二季生产计划的情形。
