    Suggest Investigation into the Murder of Tang Zhanqi and Others
    Comrade Editor: My home is in Tangjiazhuang Village, Xixia County, Henan Province. I used to be a farmhand for a landlord. I joined the revolution in July 1947 and now work in the Fire Brigade of the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. My father, Tang Zhanqi, was also a farmhand for a landlord and participated in the village's farmers' association work after liberation. As the nationwide judicial reform movement is underway today, I remembered an incident from more than two years ago.

    In the seventh month of the lunar calendar in 1949, a counter-revolutionary riot occurred in my hometown involving landlords, local reactionary teams, and bandits. Before this, bandits had hidden in the home of Zhang Junde, a rich peasant in Zhangjia'ao, south of Tangjiazhuang Village (who had served as a puppet Jia chief). After my father learned of this situation, he immediately reported it to the township head. When the township head sent someone to investigate, the bandits fled. The township head called Zhang Junde to the township people's government for questioning, but to no avail. However, Zhang Junde learned from the conversation that my father had reported the situation. Later, the bandits came again and still hid in Zhang Junde's house. One night during the enemy's riot, Zhang Junde pointed out the target, and seven bandits, including Chai Zhishan, took six guns to my house and killed my father, mother, and younger brother. Afterwards, the bandits were arrested, but Zhang Junde remained at large. After I returned home, I wrote a letter to the Judicial Section of the Xixia County People's Government requesting action. The County Judicial Section summoned Zhang Junde to the county. However, after I returned to my work post, I initially heard that Zhang Junde was sentenced to ten years in prison, but a few days later, I heard that Zhang Junde had returned home and had not been punished in any way. According to a letter from my relatives later, this was because Zhang Junde "had influence," "had good connections," and "engaged in bribery," and so on. He is still at large to this day.

    I believe this is not just a problem for my family and should be investigated. Please inform the relevant departments of this situation and ask them to promptly investigate and deal with it seriously.
    Tang Huizhong, Fire Brigade, Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau

    建议检查唐占奇等被杀害案
    编辑同志：我家在河南省西峡县唐家庄村。我本是给地主当长工的，一九四七年七月参加革命，现在郑州市人民政府公安局消防队工作。我父亲唐占奇本来也是给地主当长工的，解放后参加乡里的农会工作。正当全国开展司法改革运动的今天，我想起了两年多前的一件事。
    一九四九年农历七月间，我的家乡发生了一次地主、地方反动团队、土匪等反革命暴乱事件。在这以前，有土匪到唐家庄村南面张家凹地方的富农张俊德（曾当过伪甲长）家隐藏过。我父亲知道这情况后，马上反映给乡长。乡长派人去侦察时，土匪逃跑了。乡长把张俊德叫到乡人民政府追问，也没有结果。但从谈话中张俊德知道这情况是我父亲反映的。后来土匪又来了，仍然藏在张俊德家。在敌人暴乱期间的一个晚上，由张俊德指示目标，柴志善等七个土匪带着六枝枪到我家里，把我父亲、母亲、弟弟杀死。事后土匪被逮捕了，但张俊德仍然逍遥法外。我回家后向西峡县人民政府司法科写信请求处理，县司法科把张俊德传到县里。但我回到工作岗位后，起初听说判处张俊德十年徒刑，过了几天又听说张俊德回家去了，没有受到任何处分，据后来我的亲戚来信说，这是因为张俊德“有势力”、“关系好”、“拉拢大”等等。直到现在他仍然逍遥法外。
    我认为这不是我一家的问题，应该追究。请你们把这情况告知有关部门，请他们迅速进行了解并严肃处理。　郑州市人民政府公安局消防队　唐惠中
