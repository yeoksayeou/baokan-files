The Guarantee for Humanity's Peaceful Advance
(Abstract of a Special Article for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference)
Senderal, Head of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China, which visited our country last year

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which will soon be held in the new Chinese capital, is an epoch-making event in our world's political history. We all want peace, we want peace between countries, which means banning all wars; we want peace between all the peoples of the world, which means establishing free and friendly relations between them; and we want peace within each country. There is only one straight line between two points. There can be countless curves between two points. Similarly, there is only one truth, but there can be many lies. The highest trust is the simplest trust. The road to world peace is the road of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. There will be many excuses and pretexts for interference. Therefore, the people who most strongly undermine peace are those who interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, so all peace-loving people around the world have a duty to strive to prevent such interference by all legitimate means.

Now let us look at the countries in the Pacific region. The world's attention is now focused on these countries. Clearly, the greatest danger to world peace is now in this region. The reason is very simple. The struggle between the new People's Republic of China and the Chiang Kai-shek government is entirely an internal affair of China and the Chinese people, but the United States, thousands of miles away, still supports Chiang Kai-shek against the will of the 475 million Chinese people, stations its armed forces in Taiwan, and constantly threatens the territorial integrity, independence, and survival of the great Chinese people. The dispute between North Korea and South Korea is also entirely an internal affair of the Korean people, but the United States continues to interfere with its armed forces. I do not want to discuss here whether the means it uses are righteous or despicable. The mere act of American interference in Korea is a great danger to world peace. Similarly, the United States' virtual monopoly of Japanese manpower and other resources is one of the greatest threats to world peace today. The whole thing is so simple and clear, so clear to every honest man and woman, to every peace-loving person. Therefore, all peace-loving people around the world should do everything in their power to demand that the American troops withdraw from Taiwan, withdraw from Korea, and withdraw from Japan absolutely and unconditionally. Every peace-loving country in the world must send the call of "No interference in Taiwan, no interference in Korea, and no interference in Japan" to the United States. The peace-loving people of the world also hope that the peace-loving American people will unite with them to send out this call.

If the people of all countries abhor this unjust and unfair interference and are determined to unite against it, then there is no force in the world that can prevent them from achieving their goals for long. This position is the greatest guarantee for the peaceful advance of all of us.

    人类和平前进的保障
    （为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而作的专文的摘要）
    去年访问我国的印度亲善访华团团长  森德拉尔
    即将在新中国首都举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，是我们世界政治历史上的一个划时代事件。我们都要和平，我们要各国之间的和平，这意味着禁止一切战争；我们要全世界各国人民之间的和平，这意味着建立他们之间的自由与友好的关系；而且我们要各国国内的和平。两点之间的直线只有一条。两点之间的曲线可以有无数条。同样，真理只有一个，而谎言却可以有许多个。最高的信任就是最简单的信任。走向世界和平的道路，是不干涉其他国家内政的道路。进行干涉的藉口和托词是会有很多的。因此，破坏和平最力的人正是干涉其他国家内政的人，所以全世界一切爱好和平的人民都有义务努力用各种正当的方法来阻止这种干涉。
    现在让我们看看太平洋区域各个国家。世界的注意力现在正集中在这些国家。显然，世界和平的最大危险现在就在这个地区。理由很简单。新的中华人民共和国与蒋介石政府的斗争，完全是中国和中国人民的内政问题，但是万哩以外的美国却仍然违反四亿七千五百万中国人民的意愿而支持蒋介石，派它的武装部队驻在台湾，经常威胁着伟大中国人民的领土完整、独立和生存。北朝鲜与南朝鲜的争端也完全是朝鲜人民的内政问题，但是美国继续以它的武装部队进行干涉。我不想在这里讨论它使用的手段是正当的还是卑鄙的。光是美国干涉朝鲜这个行动，就是对世界和平的一个大危险。同样，美国实际上对日本人力及其他资源的独占，是目前对世界和平的最大威胁之一。整个事情是如此地简单明了，对每个正直的男女、对每个爱好和平的人，都是如此地清楚。所以，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都应当尽他们的一切力量，要美国军队绝对无条件地撤出台湾、撤出朝鲜和日本。世界上每个爱好和平的国家，都必须向美国发出“不准干涉台湾、不准干涉朝鲜和不准干涉日本”的呼声。全世界爱好和平的人民还希望爱好和平的美国人民与他们联合一起，发出这种呼声。
    如果各国人民憎恶这种不正当和不公正的干涉，决心团结一致来反对这种干涉，那么世界上就没有一种力量能长期地阻止他们达到他们的目标。这种立场就是我们全体人类和平前进的最大保障。
