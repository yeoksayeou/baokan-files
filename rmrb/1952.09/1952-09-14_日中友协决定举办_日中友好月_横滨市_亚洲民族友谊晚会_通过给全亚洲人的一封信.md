Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Tokyo News: The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has decided to hold "Sino-Japanese Friendship Month" from September to October to celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and will hold a commemorative meeting on October 1st.

    In order to specifically implement various related matters, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has decided to establish an "Executive Committee for Celebrating the Founding of New China" within the General Assembly. The committee members will be composed of representatives from all walks of life, social celebrities, and so on. Local areas will also widely organize local executive committees according to the actual situation.

    During "Sino-Japanese Friendship Month," the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association plans to launch a campaign to write congratulatory letters to Chairman Mao Zedong, hold Sino-Japanese friendship conferences and Sino-Japanese trade exhibitions, hold lectures in various places, and screen China's famous film "The White Haired Girl."

    At the same time, in order to carry out large-scale cultural publicity activities, the Cultural Department of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has prepared a large number of photos and woodcuts about New China, and organized a lecture group to go to various parts of the country to talk about New China upon request.

    During "Sino-Japanese Friendship Month," holding forums, lectures, exhibitions, and research conferences will become a collective activity for the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association to strengthen Sino-Japanese friendship throughout the country.

    The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has also decided to launch peace movements such as "Do not fight China" and "Send representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference" during this period.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Tokyo delayed news: On August 1st, the Japanese people passed a letter to all Asians at the "Asian National Friendship Evening" held at the Kanagawa Gymnasium in Yokohama City.

    The letter said: In the past, Japanese imperialism invaded other Asian countries, destroying their land, plundering their property, and killing innocent people. Now we want to use the great determination of all the Japanese people to compensate for those crimes: we want to defend peace in Asia.

    We oppose Japan's re-militarization and oppose Japan being used as a tool to conquer Asia. We long for an immediate end to the Korean War, therefore, we demand that the invaders get out of Asia. Asia should be managed by the Asian people.

    The letter continued: We are particularly angry about the bacteriological warfare carried out by US imperialism. All Japanese people know that the US military's occupation of Japan is the cause of great danger in Asia. That is why we demand the conclusion of a "comprehensive peace treaty" and the withdrawal of all occupying forces. We have great strength to fight to achieve this goal.

    On May 1st, International Labor Day in 1952, we fought for the defense of national independence and peace for the first time and made great progress.

    The occupying forces and traitors have attempted to confuse patriots and suppress peace-loving people. However, the Japanese people, like a furious storm, broke through the suppression and shook hands with our Asian brothers.

    The letter concluded that the Japanese people will send representatives to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing. "On that day, the representatives will welcome and shake hands with the Asian family in Beijing. We have been looking forward to such a day for a long time."

    日中友协决定举办“日中友好月”
    横滨市“亚洲民族友谊晚会”通过给全亚洲人的一封信
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：日中友好协会为了庆祝中华人民共和国建国三周年，已决定从九月到十月举行“日中友好月”，并订于十月一日举行纪念大会。
    为了具体执行各种有关的事宜，日中友协决定在总会中成立一个“庆祝新中国建国执行委员会”，委员由各阶层人民的代表、社会名流等担任。各地方也按照实际情况，广泛地组织各地的执行委员会。
    日中友协计划在“日中友好月”中发起给毛泽东主席写贺信的运动，并举行日中友好会议和中日贸易展览会，在各地举办讲演会，放映我国著名电影“白毛女”。
    同时，为了大规模地进行各种文化宣传活动，日中友协文化部准备了大量关于新中国的照片、木刻，并组织讲师团，以应全国各地的要求，前往讲述有关新中国的事情。
    在“日中友好月”期间，举行座谈会、讲演会、展览会、研究会等，将成为日中友协在全国范围内加强日中友好的集体活动的方法。
    日中友协也决定在此期间展开“不和中国打仗”、“派代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”等和平运动。
    【新华社十三日讯】东京迟到消息：八月一日，日本人民在横滨市神奈川体育会馆举行的“亚洲民族友谊晚会”通过了给全体亚洲人的一封信。
    这封信说：在过去，日本帝国主义曾侵略其他亚洲国家，破坏了他们的土地，劫掠了他们的财产，打杀了无辜人民。现在我们想以全体日本人民的巨大决心来作为对那些罪行的补偿：我们要保卫亚洲的和平。
    我们反对日本重新军国主义化，反对日本被利用做征服亚洲的工具。我们渴望立即停止朝鲜战争，因此，我们要求侵略者滚出亚洲。亚洲应该由亚洲人民来管理。
    这封信接着说：美帝国主义进行细菌战特别使我们愤怒。所有日本人民都知道，美国军队占领日本，是亚洲的大危险的原因。这就是我们为什么要求缔结“全面和约”并撤退一切占领军的理由。我们具有巨大的力量进行斗争，以达到这个目的。
    在一九五二年五月一日国际劳动节，我们第一次为保卫民族独立与和平而斗争，并得到了很大的进步。
    占领军和卖国贼们曾企图使爱国分子慌乱并镇压爱好和平的人士。但是，日本人民像一阵狂怒的暴风，穿过了镇压，和我们的亚洲兄弟们握手。
    这封信最后说，日本人民将派遣代表参加即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。“到了那一天，代表们将在北京欢迎并和亚洲家庭的人握手。我们已经对这样的日子盼望很久了。”
