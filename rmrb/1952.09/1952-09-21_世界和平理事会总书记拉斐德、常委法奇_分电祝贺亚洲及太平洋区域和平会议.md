Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th - World Peace Council Secretary-General Jean Laffargue sent a congratulatory telegram to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, titled "Homage to the Beijing Conference." The telegram reads:

From the harsh mountains of the north to the scorching places of the far south, from Japan in the east to Pakistan in the west, men and women from more than thirty countries are making their way to Beijing.

All peace-loving people are delighted by this initiative. The Beijing Conference, which concerns the prosperity and security of hundreds of millions of people, indeed represents an important stage in the history of the people of Asia and the Pacific. At the same time, this conference is a huge contribution to the cause of world peace. This conference is also an important contribution to the preparations for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna on December 5th.

There is no doubt that the current situation is exactly the same as before 1939. The flames of war are already burning in the Far East, and there is a danger of it spreading. In Korea, the war is raging madly. In Vietnam, the war continues. In Japan, war is being prepared under the occupation laws and the rearmament policy determined by the one-sided Treaty of San Francisco.

However, compared with the situation before World War II, profound changes have taken place in the world today. China, which was plagued by years of civil war and frequent famine, a feudal China and a China reduced to foreign military bases, has become a great People's Republic, which can freely control its own destiny and is moving towards a happy path of peaceful construction. The interests of the Japanese people, who aspire to independence and are fighting for it, are consistent with the vital interests of the people of the Pacific Rim countries. The people of the world hope for a speedy conclusion of an armistice agreement in Korea that respects the freedom of the heroic Korean people, and hope for a speedy end to the terror of burning and killing peaceful residents with napalm bombs or massacring them with bacteriological weapons.

Therefore, today people can hope for new developments in the situation. The situation makes them believe that peace can be saved and must be saved.

From the exchange of ideas that will take place at the Beijing Conference, and from the common desire of the participants to seek the best ways to achieve peace, the conference will undoubtedly produce important resolutions of world significance.

This conference, which has gathered to save peace in Asia, will give the people of all countries great hope and increase the possibility of postponing a world war and saving world peace. I wish the Beijing Conference a brilliant success.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th - Farge, member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the French National Peace Council, sent a telegram of congratulations to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference on the 9th. The telegram reads:

I would like to express my respect to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. I express my respect most solemnly because I feel the importance of this conference, which is the most important factor in ensuring peace. The call issued from Beijing on June 6, 1952, by forty-seven representatives from twenty countries in Asia, Australia, and the Americas, has defined a broad direction for the work of the conference; therefore, we know what issues the conference will discuss and in what spirit it will discuss them. In any case, this call gives us the assurance that our working methods are the same, whether in Europe or in Asia, because we must face the same threats. What is the content of these methods? It is:

    Clearly and bravely express the peace aspirations of the people of all countries;
    Call on the people of all countries to unite on the basis of reasonable and just demands so that these reasonable demands can be realized;
    Ensure that truth triumphs over war propaganda.

As long as the people of all countries clearly and powerfully express their will, there will be no problem that cannot be resolved peacefully. Our common mission is: to explain clearly, to understand each other, and then to take action. In this glorious struggle to defend peace, deep and lasting friendships are formed, which lay the foundation for the indestructible unity of the people of all countries, and this unity is essential for world peace.

As I extend my congratulations to this peace conference, I must pay special tribute to the Korean people. I will always remember the calmness, humility, and heroism of the Korean people. It gives us a great lesson; although the Korean people have suffered all kinds of cruel torture, they have persevered, and they have opened the eyes of many people in the world who did not believe that aggression was possible or did not know what the modern methods of aggression were.

The suffering of the people of Asian countries and their firm beliefs have made the people of the whole world bear such responsibility: the responsibility of unity and friendship.

It is with this conviction that I remotely send this friendly congratulatory telegram to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

    世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德、常委法奇
    分电祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】世界和平理事会总书记让·拉斐德致亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的贺电，题为“向北京会议致敬”，电文如下：
    从北方严峻的高山到极南的灼热地方，从东面的日本到西面的巴基斯坦，三十多个国家的男女正取道前往北京。
    一切爱好和平的人士都为这个创举欢欣鼓舞，关系亿万人民繁荣和安全的北京会议，在亚洲和太平洋各国人民的历史上的确代表着一个重要的阶段。同时，这个会议对于世界和平事业是一个巨大的贡献。这次会议对将于十二月五日在维也纳城召开的世界人民和平大会的准备工作也是一个重要的贡献。
    毫无疑问，目前的形势和一九三九年以前完全一样，战火已在远东燃烧，而且还有蔓延的危险。在朝鲜，战争在疯狂地进行着。在越南，战争持续着。在日本，战争在占领法规和旧金山片面和约所确定的扩充军备政策下准备着。
    但是，和第二次世界大战以前的情况比较起来，今天世界上已经发生了深刻的变化，连年内战、饥荒频仍的中国，封建的和沦为外国军事基地的中国，已经变成了伟大的人民共和国，它已可以自由支配自己的命运，而且正在走向幸福的和平建设的道路。渴望独立并为争取独立而斗争的日本人民的利益，是和太平洋沿岸各国人民的切身利益一致的。全世界的人民都希望在朝鲜迅速缔结尊重朝鲜英勇人民的自由的停战协定，希望迅速停止以凝固汽油弹烧杀或以细菌武器屠杀和平居民的恐怖行为。
    因此，今天人们可以希望时局有新的发展。形势使他们相信和平可以拯救，而且必须得到拯救。
    从北京会议所将要进行的思想交流，从鼓舞与会人士寻求和平最好方法的共同要求这些方面看来，大会无疑地将获得具有世界意义的重要决议。
    为了拯救亚洲和平而团聚一堂的这次会议，将给各国人民以巨大的希望，并增加推迟世界大战和拯救世界和平的可能性。敬祝北京会议获得辉煌成就。
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、法国全国和平理事会主席法奇在九日致电祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，电文如下：
    我谨向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议表示敬意。我极为郑重地表示我的敬意，是因为我感觉到这个会议的重要性，它是确保和平的最重要的因素。一九五二年六月六日亚洲、澳洲和美洲二十个国家的四十七位代表从北京发出的号召，已经为会议的工作规定了广泛的方针；因此，我们知道会议将讨论些什么问题以及将以怎样的精神来讨论这些问题。无论如何，这个号召给了我们这样一种保证，就是不论在欧洲还是在亚洲，我们的工作方法是一样的，因为我们必须面对同样的威胁。这些方法的内容是什么呢？就是：
    明白地、勇敢地表达各国人民的和平愿望；
    号召世界各国人民在合理公正的主张的基础上团结起来，使这种合理的主张能够付诸实现；
    保证使真理战胜战争的宣传。
    只要各国人民明晰地、有力地表明了他们的意志，就不会有任何问题不能找到和平解决的办法。我们的共同使命是：明晰地解释，互相了解，然后行动起来。在这保卫和平的光荣斗争里深挚和持久的友谊形成起来了，这种友谊为各国人民的不可摧毁的团结打下了基础，而这种团结是世界和平所必需的。
    在我向这次和平会议致祝贺的时候，我不得不特别向朝鲜人民致敬。我这一生将永远记着朝鲜人民的冷静、谦和与英雄主义精神。它给予我们一个伟大的教训；虽然朝鲜人民受尽一切残酷的折磨，但是他们却坚持下来，他们使世界上的许多人睁开了眼睛，这些人是不相信侵略是可能，也不知道什么是侵略的现代方式的。
    亚洲各国人民遭受的痛苦和他们坚强的信念，使全世界人民担负了这样的责任：团结和友爱的责任。
    我就是以这样的信念向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议遥致这个友好的贺电。
    伊夫·法奇（签名）
