Reader's Letter:

    Xinhua Bookstore Should Improve Distribution Work
    To the Editor: The distribution of "People's Literature" suffers severely from a situation of supply falling short of demand. For the past two years, we have frequently received letters from readers in various regions expressing opinions on the distribution work. Since January 1952, while the distribution work has seen some improvement due to continuous suggestions from the masses, the issues in the distribution work still require serious attention and appropriate resolution in the short term, judging from the recent feedback from various sources.
    This June, we widely solicited readers' opinions on the distribution work of the past six months. As of now (August 5th), we have received a total of one hundred and eighty-eight letters, including eighty-one letters from the masses and one hundred and seven letters from local literary federations and cultural centers. These letters are still being sent in one after another. Letters from areas with poor transportation and readers far in the border regions will arrive later.
    Among the one hundred and eighty-eight letters received, nearly half—eighty-seven—reflect the problem of supply falling short of demand. These letters come from twenty-five provinces and four major cities, covering a wide area, and the issues reflected are universal. The situation of untimely distribution and even missed deliveries is also quite serious, as reflected in the letters.
    Some Xinhua Bookstores in some areas, after the "Three-Anti" movement, not only fail to increase distribution volume and improve distribution work according to the needs of readers but instead reduce the book order volume. They turn a deaf ear to the obvious phenomenon of supply falling short of demand and the urgent needs of readers. They not only fail to take active measures to improve the situation but also fear distributing more books and magazines, finding it troublesome. This work style urgently needs improvement. Shortcomings such as untimely distribution and even missed deliveries should also be overcome.
    We suggest that future distribution work should be bold and unconstrained. The distribution volume in large cities, industrial areas, and areas with higher cultural levels should be greatly increased. Medium-sized cities can be appropriately increased, and small cities can be moderately increased depending on their circumstances. In rural areas, pilot distribution should be carried out with emphasis in areas with developed agricultural production.

### 新华书店应改进发行工作

专栏：读者来信

    新华书店应改进发行工作
    编辑同志：“人民文学”的发行工作，严重地存在着供不应求的现象。两年来，我们经常收到各地读者对发行工作意见的来信。一九五二年元月以来，在群众不断地提出意见下，发行工作虽然有些改进，但从最近各方面反映的情况来看，仍须严重地注意发行工作中的问题，并于短期内适当解决。
    今年六月，我们广泛地征求了读者对半年来发行工作的意见。截至目前为止（八月五日），共收到一百八十八封来信，其中有群众来信八十一封，各地文联和文化馆来信一百○七封。这类信件，还正在陆续地寄来。交通不便的地区和远在边疆的读者，他们的来信要迟一些。
    在已收到的一百八十八封来信里，反映供不应求的问题的几占半数——八十七封。这些信件来自二十五省和四大城市，地区广泛，反映的问题是有普遍性的。关于发行不及时甚至漏发等情形，来信中反映的情况也是相当严重的。
    有些地区的新华书店在“三反”运动之后，不仅不根据读者的需要，设法增加发行量和改善发行工作，反而缩小领书量，对于极明显的供不应求的现象，对于读者的迫切需要置若罔闻；不但不采取积极办法加以改善，反而怕多发行书刊，嫌麻烦，这种作风极待改进。发行不及时甚至漏发等缺点，也应注意克服。
    我们建议：今后的发行工作应大胆放手。大城市、工业区、文化较高的地区的发行量应大量增加，中等城市可适当增加，小城市可以视其情况酌量增加；农村中，在农业生产发达的地区，有重点地作试验发行。
