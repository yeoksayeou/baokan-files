Chongqing is Building Workers' Housing

The construction of the first batch of workers' housing in Chongqing has begun. These workers' residences are being built along the Jialing River in both the city and the suburbs. Ten four-story buildings will be constructed in the city to house workers involved in transportation, construction, and other industries. Forty buildings will be constructed in the suburbs to house workers in the factory districts. Once completed, these projects will solve the housing problems for 1,360 worker families and over 2,500 single workers. These workers' residences will have complete water and electrical equipment and sanitation facilities. In addition to plans to build gardens, roads, and connecting paths in the suburban workers' residential area, land has also been reserved for the future construction of vegetable markets, schools, cooperatives, and kindergartens.

The workers building these workers' residences have high enthusiasm for labor. Advanced experiences such as the Su Changyou bricklaying method and the Yang Dezhong plastering method have begun to be promoted at the urban construction sites. The bricklaying efficiency of the group promoting the Su Changyou bricklaying method has increased four to five times. Currently, workers and technicians at the work sites are brewing plans to formulate production increase and savings plans for the second half of the year. Preliminary estimates from the urban construction sites alone suggest that the construction project can be completed one month ahead of schedule and save over 610 million yuan.

    重庆市兴建工人住宅
    重庆市第一批工人住宅的兴建工程已经动工。这批工人住宅分别建筑在市内和郊区的嘉陵江边。市内修建十幢四层大楼，供市内搬运、建筑等工人居住。市郊修建四十幢大楼，供工厂区工人居住。这批工程完成后，可以解决一千三百六十户工人家庭和二千五百多单身工人的居住问题。这批工人住宅将有完备的水电设备和卫生设备。郊区工人住宅区除计划兴修花园、公路和联络道外，并留下了地基准备以后兴建菜市场、学校、合作社和幼儿园等。
    建筑这批工人住宅的工人们的劳动热情很高，市区工地已开始推广苏长有砌砖法和杨德重抹灰法等先进经验。推行苏长有砌砖法的小组的砌砖效率已提高了四五倍。现在，工场工人和技术人员正在酝酿制订下半年的增产节约计划，仅据市区工地初步估计，就可以提前一个月完成兴建工程，并节约六亿一千多万元。
