    The Struggle and Rebirth of the People of Various Ethnic Groups in Liuma
    Qiu Fanxiao
    Liuma is a district in Guanling County, Guizhou Province, comprising four townships. It is home to over 20,000 hardworking and brave people of the Yi, Miao, Han, and other ethnic groups. Liuma has vast lands, with dense, towering virgin forests; the underground is rich in antimony, iron, copper and other mineral deposits. It produces abundant cotton, tung oil, wood ear, Guanggan oranges, tangerines, sugarcane, animal skins and other products, and in summer, a large quantity of southern rare cucumbers, watermelons, cantaloupes and sweet bananas. The Liuma twill cloth and twill floral mattress pads woven by the women are well-known handicrafts in the surrounding areas. The quiet Dabang River and Bada River flow through here, and the majestic Beipan River (the upper reaches of the Pearl River) surrounds it in the southeast. The banks of these rivers are fertile lands, a rich land of fish and rice. However, before liberation, these were merely the objects of plunder by the Kuomintang bandit gangs. The Kuomintang bandit gangs not only endlessly plundered the wealth of the people here, but also constantly provoked tragic mutual killings among the various ethnic groups, and extensively conscripted soldiers, causing the people to sacrifice their lives for the private interests of the reactionaries.
    But the people here have never given up the struggle in the years of suffering. As early as the spring of 1935, when the great Chairman Mao and the Communist Party-led Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through here, the people of all ethnic groups in Liuma forged a deep bond with the Red Army. They held a grand welcome meeting for the Red Army in Leji Village on the banks of the Bada River, and even slaughtered pigs to comfort the Red Army. The Red Army also gave the people of all ethnic groups two machine guns, more than ten rifles and a bright red big banner. These gifts greatly inspired the fighting will of the people of all ethnic groups, and the red flag has been preserved to this day. After the Red Army left, some wounded and sick personnel stayed here to recuperate, and the people of all ethnic groups protected them like their own relatives. The current village chief of Banle Village, Comrade Ling Renzhong, is an old Red Army soldier from Jiangxi Province who stayed behind due to illness at that time.
    Chairman Mao's troops passed by, and the seeds of revolution sprouted here. In the spring of 1943, the people of Liuma, unable to bear the killings and oppression of the reactionaries, launched a large-scale armed uprising. More than 900 people took up arms to fight. The angry masses surrounded and attacked the pseudo-township offices everywhere, and hunted down the pseudo-personnel. The pseudo-township chiefs Xiao Lie, Zuo Xianzhang, Lei Yongguang and other blood-sucking villains and pests who carried away the people's blood and sweat money with large horses were killed in large numbers by the heroic fighting peasants, and the pseudo-township offices were smashed to pieces. Then, this people's uprising force marched towards Guanling County. After a fierce siege battle for a day and a night, the Kuomintang bandit army reinforced. At this time, the uprising people adopted the policy of preserving their strength and automatically withdrew.
    In order to maintain their bloody rule, the Kuomintang bandit gangs dispatched three regular regiments to carry out frantic burning, killing and looting in Liuma, forcing all ethnic groups to wear Han clothes, speak Han language, and cut their hair; prohibiting young men and women from "sitting on the table" [Note] and singing; and also robbing many young girls.
    After ten months of "great encirclement and suppression" by the Kuomintang reactionaries, it was superficially calm here. However, the fire of revenge burned more fiercely in everyone's heart.
    From 1947 onwards, in order to save its dying fate, the Kuomintang bandit gang intensified its oppression and exploitation of the people of all ethnic groups in Liuma. Grabbing soldiers and forcing payments, arbitrarily robbing and killing, making the whole area restless. The people of all ethnic groups could no longer bear it, and finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party's underground organization, in 1949, they shouted the slogan of resisting conscription and resisting payments, and took up arms to begin a large-scale uprising. The fire of resistance burned throughout every village and mountain, and the people's iron fists once again smashed the pseudo-district and township governments. The pseudo-personnel were scared and ran around everywhere.
    The people of all ethnic groups constantly seized guns and ammunition from the enemy to arm themselves. By autumn, when the happy day of liberation was about to arrive, this people's armed force had grown to more than 1,800 people. Now, some of them have honorably joined the People's Liberation Army, some have transferred to the production front, and the rest have joined the people's local armed forces and the people's at all levels of power organs.
    After liberation, the joy of the people is indescribable. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups launched a great patriotic production increase movement for their own happiness. Last year alone, cotton production doubled, and many labor models and cotton planting experts emerged throughout the district. Yang Laojin, a Miao poor peasant and cotton planting model from Dawan Village, Banyang Township, attended the provincial labor model conference last winter and was named a provincial cotton planting model, winning a certificate and a prize of an insecticide sprayer. This is an honor that the Miao people have never had before. The people's government correctly implemented the ethnic policies in the Common Program, and the people of all ethnic groups in Liuma have obtained true equality and become masters. From the village to the district, the people of all ethnic groups are running their own affairs. The village chiefs, township chiefs, and district chiefs are all outstanding figures selected from their own ethnic groups. As a result of the correct implementation of ethnic and economic policies, Liuma is becoming more and more prosperous day by day. Cooperatives, shops, and banks have also been established. Recently, the provincial people's government has also established ethnic health centers and ethnic primary schools here.
    Under the brilliant radiance of Chairman Mao, on the basis of ethnic unity, the people of all ethnic groups in Liuma are working hard to create their own beautiful future.
    [Note] "Sitting on the table," also known as "Shaking Malangs," is a custom of the Miao people. Young men and women sing and dance together to their heart's content. Those who fall in love through joint singing and dancing are free to marry.

    六马各族人民的斗争和新生
    邱繁嚣
    六马是贵州省关岭县的一个区，共辖四个乡。这里聚居着勤劳勇敢的彝、苗、汉等族人民二万多人。六马土地辽阔，有茂密参天的原始森林；地下埋藏着无尽的锑、铁、铜等矿藏。这里出产着丰富的棉花、桐油、木耳、广柑、橘子、甘蔗、兽皮等物产，夏天有大宗南方稀有的黄瓜、西瓜、香瓜和甜蜜的香蕉果。妇女们织的六马斜纹布和斜纹花垫单，是远近闻名的美术品。静静的打邦河和八大河从这里穿过，雄伟的北盘江（珠江上游）在东南面围拱着。这些河川的两岸，都是肥美的土地，富饶的鱼米之乡。但是，在未解放以前，这些都只是国民党匪帮的抢劫对象罢了。国民党匪帮不仅无止境地掠夺这里人民的财富，还不断地在各民族间挑起相互仇杀的惨剧，并大肆抓兵，使人民为反动派的私利而牺牲性命。
    但这里的人民在苦难的岁月里，从来没有放弃过斗争。远在一九三五年的春天，伟大的毛主席和共产党领导的中国工农红军从这里经过时，六马的各族人民就和红军结下了深厚的感情。他们在八大河畔的乐纪村开了盛大的欢迎红军大会，还杀了猪来慰劳红军。红军也送给各族人民两挺机关枪、十多条步枪和一面红艳艳的大锦旗。这些礼物大大鼓舞了各族人民的斗争意志，红旗并被一直保存到现在。红军走后，有些伤病人员在这里留下来休养，各族人民就像对待自己亲人一样把他们保护起来。现在板乐村的村长凌仁忠同志，就是那时因病留下来的江西籍红军老战士。
    毛主席的队伍走过去了，革命的种子在这里发了芽。一九四三年春天，六马人民不堪反动派的杀戮和压榨，掀起了大规模的武装暴动。仅拿起枪杆子来进行战斗的就有九百多人。愤怒的人群，到处围打伪乡公所，追捕伪人员。伪乡长萧烈、左宪章、雷永光等喝人血的恶棍和用大马驮走人民血汗钱的害虫，大批地被英勇战斗的农民砍死了，伪乡公所被打得稀烂。接着，这支人民的暴动队伍向关岭县城进军。经过一天一夜的激烈的攻城战斗，国民党匪军增援了。这时，暴动的人民采取了保存有生力量的政策，自动撤退下来。
    国民党匪帮为了保持他们的血腥统治，调来三个正规团，在六马进行疯狂的烧杀和掠夺，强迫各民族穿汉衣，说汉话，剪发；不让男女青年“坐表”〔注〕和歌唱；还抢走不少年轻的姑娘。
    经过国民党反动派十个月的“大清剿”，这里表面上平静了。然而，复仇的怒火却更炽烈地在每一个人的内心里燃烧着。
    一九四七年起，国民党匪帮为了挽救它垂死的命运，对六马各族人民的压迫剥削更变本加厉。抓兵逼款，任意抢杀，闹得全区鸡犬不宁。各族人民忍无可忍，终于在共产党地下组织的领导下，在一九四九年喊起抗兵抗款的口号，拿起武器，开始了大规模的暴动。反抗的怒火烧遍了每个村落和山岗，人民的铁拳再次把伪区乡政府打得稀烂。伪人员吓得到处乱跑。
    各族人民不断地从敌人手里夺获了枪支和弹药来武装自己。到秋天，可喜的解放的日子快要到来的时候，这支人民武装已经发展到一千八百多人了。现在他们有的光荣地参加了人民解放军，有的转入了生产战线，其余的参加了人民地方武装和人民的各级政权机关工作。
    解放后，人民的欢悦是无法形容的。各族人民在共产党领导下，为着自己的幸福，展开了爱国增产大运动。去年仅棉花就增产了两倍，全区出现了许多劳动模范和植棉能手。板阳乡打万村植棉模范苗族贫农杨老金，去年冬天出席了全省的劳动模范大会，被评为全省的植棉模范，得了奖状和一架杀虫喷雾器的奖品。这是苗族人民从来没有过的光荣。人民政府正确地执行共同纲领中的民族政策，六马的各族人民得到了真正的平等，作了主人。从村到区，都是各族人民自己来当家。村长、乡长、区长都是由本民族中选拔出来的优秀人物。民族政策和经济政策正确执行的结果，六马一天比一天繁荣起来了。合作社、商店和银行也成立起来了。最近省人民政府又在这里建立了民族卫生所和民族小学。
    在毛主席的光辉照耀下，在民族团结的基础上，六马各族人民正在努力创建自己美好的将来。
    〔注〕“坐表”又叫做“摇马郎”，是苗族人民的风俗。男女青年在一块纵情地歌舞。因共同歌舞而发生爱情的，可以自由结婚。
