The Seventh Anniversary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
Chang Zheng, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party

    On August 15, 1945, the Soviet Red Army defeated the Japanese fascists. The Vietnamese people launched a general uprising and seized power. On August 19, 1945, the revolutionary regime was established in Hanoi and many provinces across the country. The August Revolution was a success.
    On September 2, 1945, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was born.
    This is a glorious day for the Vietnamese nation, marking the end of the era of being slaves to French colonialists and domestic feudal emperors, and simultaneously beginning a new era – an era of advancing from new democracy to socialism.
    This is the day each year when the Vietnamese people thank the Soviet Red Army for defeating the Japanese fascists and directly helping the Vietnamese people's general uprising succeed.
    This is also the day each year when the Vietnamese people thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which continuously defeated the Japanese fascists for eight years, contributing an important force to the annihilation of the Japanese fascists.

The Establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

    Since the French colonialists set foot on Vietnamese territory, the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence has never ceased, but many times it ended in failure. The Nghe An Soviet (1930) was a courageous action to strive for the establishment of a people's regime. In the cause of striving for the establishment of this regime, the August Revolution (1945) was the first great victory.
    Just taking the several uprisings between the First and Second World Wars, each time, the Vietnamese people took advantage of the French colonialists being busy with war, rising up to seize power. During the First World War, the army and political prisoners revolted in Thai Nguyen (August 1917), later withdrew from the city to wage guerrilla warfare, and failed after persisting for seven months. During the Second World War, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, the Vietnamese people launched small-scale uprisings in various places:
    September 1940, Bac Son Uprising;
    November 1940, Southern Uprising;
    January 1941, Do Luong Uprising.
    In May 1941, the Vietnam Independence League (Viet Minh for short) was established, uniting all forces of the entire nation resisting French and Japanese fascism, calling on all people to rise up and join the ranks of saving the country, preparing for a general uprising. In August 1941 and April 1942, guerrilla units carried out activities in Dinh Ca, Trang Xa (Thai Nguyen), and other places.
    In October 1944, guerrilla units were again active in Dinh Ca, Trang Xa. In December 1944, the guerrilla units in Cao Bang, Bac Kan, Lang Son and other places were unified into the Vietnam Liberation Army. They immediately liberated the enemy strongholds of Phiet Kha, Na Ngan, etc., and went south to the middle reaches of the Red River in the north. At the same time, the guerrilla units in Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang and other places were unified into the National Salvation Army, expanding armed propaganda in these two provinces.
    On March 9, 1945, the Japanese fascists launched a "coup," excluding the French colonialists from the colonial ruling apparatus. The Indochinese Communist Party immediately launched the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. The Vietnam Liberation Army and the National Salvation Army dealt serious blows to the Japanese fascists. Political prisoners in many places rose up to destroy prisons and returned to the fighting ranks of the Party and the Viet Minh front. Political prisoners and soldiers in Ba To (Quang Ngai) launched an uprising and established the Ba To Guerrilla Unit. This guerrilla unit made considerable contributions to seizing power in the south-central region during the August Uprising in 1945. From March to August 1945, the guerrilla movement developed in Cao Bang, Lang Son, Bac Kan, Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang, Ha Giang, Yen Bai, Quang Yen, Ninh Binh and Quang Ngai. In many places across the country, the masses marched and demonstrated, armed to destroy the granaries of the Japanese fascists, and solved the great famine caused by the French and Japanese fascists themselves -- this famine, from the winter of 1944 to the spring of 1945, starved more than two million people to death.
    The high tide of anti-Japanese national salvation rapidly brought hundreds of thousands of people into the revolutionary camp. In the period from March to August 1945, on the eve of the general uprising, very rich experience in mobilizing the masses was gained. The five months of revolution were comparable to dozens of years in ordinary times. In the process of mobilizing the masses, the Party gave full play to the wisdom of the masses, and promptly replaced old forms of propaganda, organization, and struggle with new ones, and replaced old slogans with new slogans, coordinating these forms and slogans with each other, using these transitional organizations and forms of struggle to smoothly bring the masses into the revolutionary camp. Also in this process, the Vietnam Liberation Army and the National Salvation Army were unified into the Vietnam Liberation Army. Armed self-defense organizations were developed in most villages. In the liberated areas of Cao Bang, Lang Son, Bac Kan, Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang, Ha Giang and other provinces, the initial forms of democratic power were established. At the same time, in some areas outside the above-mentioned liberated areas where the mass movement was quite developed, local national liberation movement committees were also established. All kinds of national salvation organizations of the Viet Minh developed rapidly, absorbing millions of compatriots.
    In August 1945, the Ninth Plenary Session of the Indochinese Communist Party and the National Congress were held in Tan Trao, Viet Bac. The Tan Trao National Congress elected the National Committee for National Liberation under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, which was the Provisional Government of Vietnam.
    As soon as the National Congress closed, the Japanese fascists announced their unconditional surrender. The order for a general uprising was issued. The Vietnamese people were infinitely invigorated and bravely rose up to overthrow the regime of the Japanese fascists, seizing some of their weapons. Most of the "security soldiers" revolted and turned to the people. The puppet emperor Bao Dai was forced to abdicate. The system of emperors and powerful landlords was crushed by the people, and the people's revolutionary power was established nationwide.
    The August Revolution was the inevitable result of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary movement for more than eighty years, especially the result of the Viet Minh movement led by Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Indochinese Communist Party. The victory of the August Revolution was due to the following three factors: First, the Soviet Red Army defeated the Japanese fascists. Second, the Vietnamese people united closely in the Viet Minh front and carried out arduous and resolute struggles. Third, the correct leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Indochinese Communist Party.

National Resistance

    Did the French colonialists and American interventionists think that recognizing the puppet Bao Dai's false independence and unity could deceive the Vietnamese people? They were wrong. They did not know how many lives the Vietnamese people sacrificed to win the greatest achievement of the revolution - the establishment of a people's democratic regime. Absolutely no reactionary forces can make the Vietnamese people give up this precious right.
    In September 1945, with the help of British imperialism, the French colonialists attacked the people's power in the south, occupying Saigon and many cities in the south. The people in the south and south-central Vietnam rose up to resist.
    In the north, Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who entered Vietnam to collect weapons from the Japanese army, attempted to overthrow the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and support the treasonous Vietnamese Nationalist Party to seize power under the instigation of American imperialists. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam faced serious threats at its inception.
    At that time, the question before us was how to get rid of the extremely difficult situation created by domestic and foreign enemies, how to maintain and consolidate the people's democratic power led by the Party, organize the masses, develop strength, and at the same time maintain the peace loved by the Vietnamese and French people and the people of the world. Under such circumstances, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the French colonialists signed the Preliminary Agreement of March 6, 1946, and the Provisional Agreement of September 14 of the same year.
    The Vietnamese government faithfully fulfilled the agreements signed by both sides, but the French colonialists deliberately violated these agreements and were determined to re-invade our country. Who provoked the conflicts in Hai Phong, Bac Ninh and other places, and massacred our compatriots in An Ninh Street in Hanoi in November and December 1946? It was the French colonialists.
    In 1946, the French colonialists had already begun to gradually implement the plan of "re-conquering Vietnam". The above-mentioned provocations were precisely to realize this greedy and vicious plan. The Vietnamese people's resistance war had been going on since September 23, 1945 in the south and south-central Vietnam.
    The nationwide resistance war that began on December 19, 1946, was only a further development of this situation created by the French colonialists in Vietnam.
    In December 1946, the Vietnamese people stood at the crossroads of two paths. One path was to unite and resist, eliminate the French colonialists, and smash their conspiracy of "re-conquering Vietnam"; the other path was to still be slaves of the colonialists. We chose the first path, the path of using the national liberation war to defend and develop the achievements of the August Revolution. We were determined to strive for the true independence and complete unification of the motherland, consolidate and develop the people's democratic system, and defend world peace.
    A new period of development of the Vietnamese revolution began, this is the arduous but also the most glorious period of our nation. The Vietnamese people stood on the side of the peace, democracy and socialism camp led by the Soviet Union, resisting the enemy who invaded us, the French colonialists and the American interventionists, as well as their running dogs - the treacherous Vietnamese puppets.
    The August Revolution brought power to the Vietnamese people, but this power has not yet been consolidated; the August Revolution established a people's democratic system, but this system has not yet been perfected. The current resistance war is a revolutionary war, inheriting the cause of the August Revolution and promoting the national and democratic revolution of the Vietnamese people forward.

Achievements and Difficulties

    At the beginning of the resistance war, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Party had already pointed out to the entire people that the guiding principle of our entire national liberation war was: "Long-term resistance, self-reliance." Chairman Ho Chi Minh also often said: "The resistance war will definitely be victorious, but it must be long-term and arduous." The Vietnamese people firmly grasped this principle and believed in this sentence. Therefore, the Vietnamese people united and struggled, determined to smash all the greedy and vicious conspiracies of the enemy, and grew rapidly in the resistance war.
    In the political aspect, the French and American imperialist aggressors knew that the strength of the Vietnamese resistance war was the people's masses, and the weakness of the imperialists was that they were hated by the people. Therefore, they tried their best to deceive and alienate the Vietnamese nation, and implement the vicious policy of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese."
    First, they relied on reactionary feudal landlords and comprador bourgeoisie such as Bao Dai, Nguyen Van Tam, and Nguyen De, to re-establish a puppet regime in Vietnam. In the enemy-occupied areas, they selected a group of old local bullies - mostly reactionary rich peasants and rogue elements - to organize fake maintenance committees, calling them "district committees" or "village committees". They implemented "sweeping-up operations," forced young people to become soldiers, and organized various puppet troops, calling them the Vietnamese National Army, Bao Chinh Doan, etc.
    They instructed the reactionaries who wore religious cloaks, led by the spy elements Joan Dooley and the national traitors Nguyen Huu Tho and Ngo Dinh Thuc, to carry out deception and wooing of religious believers, put forward the so-called slogan of "uniting religions and opposing communism," and tried their best to win over followers of Catholicism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hoa Hao, and Cao Dai, in an attempt to establish an anti-communist front, disrupt our resistance war work, and disturb our rear.
    They tried their best to buy over and win over the various ethnic minorities, attempting to establish "autonomous countries" such as the Thai and Muong, or airdropped weapons to bandits on the Sino-Vietnamese border, in order to disturb our people's power.
    American spy chief Hess and agents of French and American imperialism are intensifying espionage warfare. The Nguyen Van Tam puppet government established the "Pacification and Amnesty Department" in order to intensify the buying over, deceiving, and alienating of our people.
    The enemy's goal is "divide and conquer". But the Vietnamese people united in resistance and were always vigilant. On March 3, 1951, the Viet Minh and the Lien Viet were unified nationwide, and the national united front was henceforth called the Vietnam National United Front (Viet Lien Front for short). Its program and organizational regulations were fully in line with the Labor Party's specific policies during the resistance war. From its new program and organizational regulations, it is very clear that the Viet Lien Front is a broad political organization of the Vietnamese people.
    The resistance movement of the Catholic Church in the Third Interzone of northern Vietnam, the resistance faction of the Cao Dai religion led by Cao Trieu Phat in the south, and many local Buddhist national salvation organizations, all joined the Viet Lien Front. This proves that the French colonialists and American interventionists cannot deceive the followers of various religions in Vietnam.
    In order to avoid suffering fatal blows from the imperialists, and to facilitate the unity of the entire nation to carry out the resistance war, the Indochinese Communist Party had voluntarily gone underground for a period of time (but announced its automatic dissolution); until February 11, 1951, the Party convened its Second National Congress, reorganized into the Vietnam Labor Party. On March 3, 1951, the Party appeared before the people under its new name. Since then, the Party's influence among people of all strata has gradually expanded and deepened, and the Party's leadership has become increasingly consolidated.
    The fact is contrary to the enemy's attempt to alienate the Vietnamese nation and isolate the Communist Party.
    The fact is also contrary to the enemy's attempt to isolate the Vietnamese people from the peace-loving people of the world. The Vietnamese government has been recognized by the Soviet Union, China and other people's democratic countries. The ties between the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, especially the people of the Soviet Union, China and Korea, are becoming increasingly close. The French people, led by the French Communist Party, are increasingly strengthening their struggle against the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The fact is also contrary to the enemy's attempt to alienate the three nations of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in order to turn the three countries into a base for aggression against China. The people of the three countries are increasingly closely united in the Vietnam-Cambodia-Laos alliance established in March 1951, jointly eliminating the common enemy.
    The political alienation carried out by the French colonialists and American interventionists against the Vietnamese people is an attempt to invade us with military force. On the one hand, they attacked us in the south and south-central Vietnam, and at the same time, they signed preliminary agreements with our government in order to use this agreement to peacefully advance into northern and north-central Vietnam. On April 8, 1946, at that time the head of the French invading army, Hilaire, ordered the French Expeditionary Force to prepare to turn this peaceful occupation into a "coup" and use some "special forces" to arrest Vietnamese patriots.
    The conspiracy of the French colonialists to re-invade the entire Vietnam has become obvious. The Vietnamese people have implemented a nationwide resistance war and will never let the French colonialists and their lackeys Blum and D'Argenlieu easily realize their conspiracy.
    In the six years of the resistance war, Vietnam has made great progress in military and other aspects. The Vietnamese army has changed from only a few medium regiments (i.e., regiments - translator) in the past that were not enough in politics, equipment and fighting experience, into a regular army with national, democratic and people's nature, and will be further modernized. At present, the Vietnamese People's Army is using modern weapons seized from the enemy to kill the enemy, and has established some earth-shattering military exploits. For example, the Border Campaign in the autumn and winter of 1947 wiped out 6,000 enemies; the Border Campaign in the autumn and winter of 1950 liberated the five provinces of Cao Bang, Lang Son, Lao Cai, Thai Nguyen, and Hoa Binh, wiping out nearly 10,000 enemies; the Hoa Binh Campaign from winter 1951 to spring 1952 wiped out more than 20,000 enemies on the battlefields of the entire northern region and the Hoa Binh area. Since the nationwide resistance war, our army has wiped out nearly 220,000 enemies.
    Summarizing our own experiences and learning from the experiences of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, striving to learn Chairman Ho Chi Minh's instructions and deeply understanding Mao Zedong's military thought, the Vietnamese People's Army is progressing by leaps and bounds. The rectification movement of the troops is being carried out enthusiastically, and has already received many good results.
    While carrying out military aggression, the French colonialists and American interventionists are also making every effort to attack us economically. In order to realize the conspiracy of "using war to support war, using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," they have repeatedly launched "sweeping-up operations," forcibly conscripting young people into the army, and burning the crops of the Vietnamese people. In the enemy-occupied areas, farmers have to replace livestock to pull plows, because the cattle have been slaughtered or eaten by the enemy. Recently, just as American planes were bombing the hydroelectric power station on the Yalu River, French planes also bombed our water conservancy projects, making it difficult for us to cultivate due to lack of water.
    In addition, they also used fake money to buy our grain, causing our prices to rise. They strafed and destroyed our boats and transportation lines, making it difficult for us to trade. They established no-man's lands, making trade between the liberated areas and the enemy-held areas obstructed.
    The enemy's purpose is to strike at the source of our supplies everywhere, attempting to make our soldiers and civilians suffer from hunger and cause difficulties in our financial and economic aspects.
    In order to deal with the enemy, our policy is to develop production, unify financial and economic management, reform the tax system, rectify the organization, develop domestic and international trade, and carry out economic struggle with the enemy....
    The increase production and practice economy movement has been enthusiastically responded to by the people this year. Our Party, government, military, and civilian institutions have been rectifying their organization since last year, reducing unnecessary personnel, and increasing manpower for production. The supply standard has been clearly stipulated in order to avoid abuse. The work of anti-corruption, anti-waste and anti-bureaucratism, although it has not formed a broad movement like in China, has already started from education and inspection work. Last year, in accordance with the principles of fairness and reasonableness, encouraging production and uniting in the resistance war, the collection of agricultural tax and industrial and commercial tax was stipulated, which has greatly increased the income of the national treasury. State-owned trade is developing, supplying the people with various necessities such as rice, salt, cloth, etc., and encouraging private trade, and developing the sales of forest products and local products.
    In order to cultivate the strength of the people - most of whom are farmers - the resistance government has confiscated the land of French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors, distributed it to poor farmers, implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, redistributed public land, and expanded credit loans to the people for production. As of the beginning of 1951, the country had distributed 253,882 hectares of land to 422,643 landless or land-poor farmers. 54,514 landlords have implemented a 25% rent reduction in accordance with government decrees. Most of the public land has been more fairly redistributed to male and female citizens over the age of sixteen. In 1952, the government allocated 15 billion Vietnamese dong in credit loans to farmers as production capital. The purpose of the above-mentioned financial and economic policies is to develop production, ensure supply, and cultivate the strength of the resistance war and the people. In order to achieve this goal, various financial and economic measures of the government are being made to achieve balanced income and expenditure, stabilize prices and consolidate currency values.
    The enemy is very insidious and vicious, our economic difficulties are still many, but relying on the unity and patriotic spirit of our people, we can very well achieve the above-mentioned financial and economic goals.
    In the cultural and social aspects, in order to easily invade our country, the enemy is making every effort to promote its deception and obscurantism policies. On the one hand, they publish books and newspapers to promote false independence and unity; organize several showy relief efforts to publicize "American aid"; and educate the youth in schools in enemy-occupied areas with the idea of ​​slave obedience. On the other hand, they plot for those reactionaries who wear religious cloaks to strengthen missionary work, taking up the time and energy of religious believers, making them ignore the resistance war work; they persuade religious believers to endure and compromise on the various acts of killing, oppression and exploitation by the invaders, to bear "sins" for the entire nation that supports the Viet Minh...; at the same time, they force the youth in enemy-occupied areas to participate in "sweeping-up operations," and instigate them to engage in rape, arson, and murder, turning our youth into hooligans; they set up opium dens, gambling dens and brothels, and screen obscene and thief-inducing films, making the youth in enemy-occupied areas corrupted and degenerate. American imperialists occupy an important position in these shameless acts of poisoning the youth in the enemy-occupied areas.
    Contrary to the French colonialists and American interventionists, the Vietnamese government's cultural policy is to organize and encourage the masses to learn to read and write. In the past seven years, 14 million people have been freed from the suffering of illiteracy; establish civilian literacy schools and worker-peasant accelerated schools, allowing worker-peasant cadres and worker, peasant, and soldier heroes to make up for culture; reform education, implement a nine-year general school system, and establish a one-year university preparatory class, preparing to rectify the university, and open various specialized technical schools. In the past few years, every state-owned factory and factories led by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor are specialized technical schools, cultivating various specialized technical talents and apprentices.
    Our literature, science and art, although still with many shortcomings, have developed in the resistance war. With the purpose of "serving the people" and "serving the resistance war," Vietnamese culture has embarked on a new path, the path of people's democracy. In the resistance war, many old customs of the feudal colonial era have been reformed or abolished, and new lives and ideas have become a movement that gradually penetrates into the daily lives of the people. Patriotic competition has created a new style. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's new education policy: "Diligence, thrift, integrity, and selflessness" has gradually penetrated the daily work and life of cadres and the people.
    Although there are many difficulties in printing and distribution, the resistance war newspapers are still published regularly, carrying out propaganda and education with the ideas of patriotism and hatred of imperialism. Their task is to mobilize the people to participate in the resistance war, strive for the complete independence and unity of the motherland, and defend world peace.
    The rectification work is being carried out in the Party and the troops, and will be universally started in the government and the various organs of the Viet Lien Front. This work is of great significance. It will enable cadres to clarify their positions, recognize the enemies and friends at home and abroad, and correctly grasp the principle of "long-term resistance and self-reliance."
    Generally speaking, the compatriots in the enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas love the motherland. Recently, the work behind enemy lines has been gradually rectified. Many good results have also been achieved in aspects such as sabotage work, disintegrating the enemy's puppet work, guerrilla warfare, anti-"sweeping-up operations," anti-Latin Lav, and resisting the enemy's destruction of crops...
    In short, the seven years of the resistance war are the seven years of great progress of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. But along with the above-mentioned achievements and progress, there are still many difficulties and shortcomings that must be overcome.
    Some difficulties are caused by French and American imperialism, and some difficulties are caused by our own shortcomings and mistakes. But in general, they are all difficulties in development. The greater shortcomings that currently exist are impure thoughts among cadres. The purpose of the rectification movement is to transform the thinking of cadres inside and outside the Party.

Current Tasks

    Our resistance war is in the second stage, that is, the stalemate stage. The stalemate stage is the stage of preparing for the general counter-offensive in order to strive for the final victory.
    At the end of last year, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Party Central Committee put forward the three major tasks of the Party and the government at present:
    1. Eliminate the enemy's vital strength and vigorously promote guerrilla warfare;
    2. Smash the enemy's conspiracy of "using war to support war, using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese";
    3. Cultivate the strength of the people and the resistance war.
    Completing the above three major tasks, we will be stronger than the enemy, and we will be able to turn to the general counter-offensive.
    In order to complete the above three major tasks, at present, the Party must lead the entire people to carry out the following five main tasks:
    1. Increase production and practice economy;
    2. Strengthen work behind enemy lines;
    3. Rectify the Party;
    4. Rectify the army;
    5. Rectify mass work.
    The increase production and practice economy movement has received initial results. In the liberated areas, many families and villages are carrying out production according to plan. In the various guerrilla areas and guerrilla base areas, the people also responded to the government's call to participate in the increase production and practice economy movement, and combine the increase production work with resisting the enemy's "sweeping-up" and looting and destruction.
    Now, the increase production work is being carried out at the same time as preparing for the collection of the autumn agricultural tax.
    The people are becoming increasingly conscious of increasing production in order to improve their personal lives and contribute their share to ensuring the needs of the resistance war. When the troops are charging into battle at the front, in the rear, workers, peasants and mental workers are carrying out production competitions with the attitude of masters of the people's democratic country.
    The National Heroes and Model Workers Congress convened in May 1952 commended the spirit of patriotism and safeguarding world peace of the worker, peasant, and soldier masses and progressive intellectuals in our country, as well as the correct work and labor attitude.
    However, because our industrial development is limited, there is a relative lack of machines and tools, and technological improvements are subject to many obstacles. The war requires a lot of manpower, the youth in the enemy-held areas are being drafted by the enemy, and the enemy is also destroying crops, bridges and dams, killing cattle... etc., which have all had a certain impact on production.
    This year, because the Party and the government attach importance to work behind enemy lines, the work behind enemy lines has been greatly rectified. After the Hoa Binh campaign, the enemy's vital strength suffered great losses, and therefore, the work behind enemy lines has more significant possibilities for development. At present, behind the inhuman no-man's land created by the enemy on the Viet Bac Plain, many places have been liberated and guerrilla base areas have also been established. Many of the enemy's strongholds are surrounded by the people's armed forces, to the extent that they can only be supplied by plane. In the north, our army vigorously attacked the enemy, and the enemy's elite troops were attracted to the north; therefore, in other battlefields, such as the Binh-Tri-Thien area, the Fifth Interzone, and the south, our guerrilla warfare has also been developed. At present, we are summarizing the anti-"sweeping-up" experience, to make cadres deeply understand the idea of ​​"developing guerrilla warfare to annihilate the enemy's vital strength," as well as the idea of ​​"cultivating and accumulating strength behind enemy lines."
    The work of rectifying the Party and rectifying the army is being carried out in accordance with the following guiding principles: first rectify thinking, then rectify the organization; first rectify the upper levels, then rectify the lower levels; first rectify the cadres, then rectify the general Party members and soldiers. The rectification work is currently being carried out intensely and enthusiastically. Various departments and cadres at all levels will take turns to participate in the rectification in order to transform their thinking and clarify their class standpoints and views. Use proletarian revolutionary thought to fight against various non-proletarian thoughts, especially petty-bourgeois thought.
    The rectification work is a fierce ideological struggle. The first few rectification classes have already received good results. After the cadres have been rectified, they will begin to rectify mass work - mainly the work of the peasant movement. The branches and organs of power are rectified at the same time in the process of rectifying mass work.
    The movement to defend world peace is one of the central tasks of the communist and workers' parties of various countries at present. How are we doing it? The enemy attempts to occupy our country as a base for attacking China and then launching a third world war. Our resistance war is striking at the enemy's conspiracy. Therefore, every piece of work in our resistance war is the most practical work to defend world peace. In our case, killing the enemy, increasing production, rectifying the Party, rectifying the army, etc., all have the significance of defending world peace. Therefore, we must closely integrate the signature campaign to demand the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers, oppose the American imperialists' arming of Japan and West Germany, oppose the American aggressors' carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea and northeastern China, respond to the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, etc., with our resistance war. Our international tasks and national tasks are so closely integrated. We are attacking the aggressors not only to strive for the independence of the motherland and the freedom of the people, but also to defend world peace and democracy.

Conclusion

    Looking back on the path that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has traveled in the past seven years, we can understand:
    1. Because the Soviet Union defeated the Japanese fascists in the Second World War, the Vietnamese people gained a good opportunity to seize power. For the first time, a democratic republic appeared in Southeast Asia. It was established on the basis of a colonial and semi-feudal country. This republic implements the people's democratic dictatorship. The Vietnamese people's democratic dictatorship is the dictatorship of the revolutionary classes among the people - the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie and a part of patriotic and progressive gentry - over the imperialist aggressors - the French colonialists and the American aggressors - and their running dogs, the reactionary feudal landlords and comprador bourgeoisie.
    The historical task of the Vietnamese people's democratic dictatorship is to eliminate the imperialist aggressors, develop people's democracy, and lead Vietnam to socialism.
    2. To make the revolution successful, it is necessary to gather all the forces of the national united front (Viet Lien Front), establish the People's Liberation Army, and carry out armed struggle to resist the imperialist aggressors and the Vietnamese traitor puppets. The national united front and the People's Liberation Army must be led by the revolutionary party of the working class (Vietnam Labor Party).
    At the same time, the domestic national democratic revolutionary movement must be closely linked to the world peace, democracy and socialist movement led by the Soviet Union.
    3. The Vietnamese revolution is a close combination of national revolution and democratic revolution. The revolutionary driving force is the Vietnamese people led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, we call the Vietnamese revolution the people's national democratic revolution. The fundamental task of the revolution is anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism.
    These two tasks are interconnected and inseparable. At present, the central task of the Vietnamese revolution is to strive for national liberation. This task contains anti-imperialist and anti-feudal nature, because to overthrow the imperialist aggressors, we must at the same time overthrow their running dogs, the reactionary feudal forces. The national resistance war of the Vietnamese nation is the most fierce revolutionary struggle. The young Democratic Republic of Vietnam is growing rapidly through this great test.
    The Vietnamese revolution will never stop halfway, and will be transformed from the people's national democratic revolution into the socialist revolution. Vietnam will inevitably enter socialism from the path of people's democracy, and will never take any other path.
    We will inevitably crush all the reactionary forces placed by the French colonialists and American interventionists on the road of the Vietnamese people's advance.

    自从法国殖民主义者踏上了越南的领土，越南人民争取民族独立的斗争就从未间断过，但许多次都失败了。宜安苏维埃（一九三○年）是一次争取建立人民政权的无畏的行动。在为争取建立这一政权的事业上，八月革命（一九四五年）是第一次伟大的胜利。
    仅就第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战之间的几次起义来说，每一次，越南人民都利用法国殖民主义者忙于战争的时机，起而夺取政权。在第一次世界大战期间，军队和政治犯在太原起义（一九一七年八月），后来撤出城外打游击，坚持七个月后失败了。在第二次世界大战期间，越南人民在东洋共产党的领导下，曾在各地发动小规模的起义：
    一九四○年九月，北山起义；
    一九四○年十一月，南部起义；
    一九四一年一月，都良起义。
    一九四一年五月，越南独立同盟（简称越盟）成立，统一了全民族抵抗法、日法西斯主义的一切力量，号召全体人民起来参加救国的队伍，准备总起义。一九四一年八月、一九四二年四月，游击队在庭嘉、长舍（太原）等地都曾进行活动。
    一九四四年十月，游击队又在庭嘉、长舍活动。一九四四年十二月，高平、北?、谅山等地的游击队刚刚统一成为越南解放军，就立即解放了费喀、那银等敌据点，并南下北部红河中游。同时，太原、宣光等地的游击队统一成为救国军，在这两省扩展武装宣传。
    一九四五年三月九日，日本法西斯主义者发动“政变”，把法国殖民主义者排除出殖民地统治机构之外。东洋共产党立即发动了抗日救国运动。越南解放军和救国军给日本法西斯主义者以严重的打击。许多地方的政治犯都起来破坏监狱，回到党和越盟阵线的战斗队伍中来。巴的（广义）地方的政治犯和士兵发动起义，成立巴的游击队。这个游击队在一九四五年八月的起义中，对于夺取中部南面的政权有过相当贡献。一九四五年三月至八月，游击运动在高平、谅山、北?、太原、宣光、河阳、安沛、广安、宁平和广义等地发展。全国有许多地方，群众游行示威，武装破坏日本法西斯主义者的谷仓，自己解决由法、日法西斯主义者所造成的大饥荒——这次饥荒自一九四四年冬至一九四五年春，饿死二百多万人。
    抗日救国的高潮迅速地使数十万群众参加到革命阵营里来。在一九四五年三月至八月总起义前夕的
    一段时间，获得很丰富的动员群众的经验，革命的五个月比得上平常数十年的时间。党在动员群众的过程中，发挥了群众的智慧，并及时用新的宣传、组织和斗争形式代替旧的形式，用新的口号代替旧的口号，把这些形式和口号互相配合，用这些过渡的组织和斗争形式，顺利地把群众带进革命阵营里来。也在这一个过程中，越南解放军和救国军统一成为越南解放军。大部分乡村都发展了武装自卫组织。在高平、谅山、北?、太原、宣光、河阳等省解放区内成立了最初的民主政权形式，同时，在上述解放区以外的一些群众运动相当发展的地区，也成立各地的民族解放运动委员会。越盟的各种救国组织，都迅速地发展，吸收了几百万同胞。
    一九四五年八月，东洋共产党九中全会和国民大会在越北新潮地方召开，新潮的国民大会选出了在胡志明主席领导下的民族解放全国委员会，这就是越南临时政府。
    国民大会刚刚闭幕，日本法西斯主义者宣布无条件投降。总起义的命令发出了。越南人民无限振奋，勇敢地起来推翻日本法西斯主义者的政权，缴获他们的一部分武器。大部分“保安兵”起义，投向人民。傀儡皇帝保大被迫退位。帝王强豪的制度被人民粉碎了，人民的革命政权在全国范围内成立了。
    八月革命是越南人民八十多年的革命运动的必然结果，特别是胡志明主席和东洋共产党所领导的越盟运动的结果。八月革命的胜利，系由下列三因素造成：第一，苏联红军打败了日本法西斯主义者。第二，越南人民在越盟阵线中紧密团结并进行艰苦而坚决的斗争。第三，胡志明主席和东洋共产党的正确领导。
    民族抗战
    法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者以为承认保大傀儡的假独立统一就可以欺骗越南人民吗？他们错了。他们不知道越南人民牺牲了多少生命才赢得革命的最大成果——建立人民民主政权。绝对没有任何反动势力可以使越南人民放弃这珍贵的权利。
    一九四五年九月，法国殖民主义者在英帝国主义的帮助下向南部的人民政权进攻，占领西贡和南部的许多城市，南部和中部南面的人民起来抗战。
    在北部，入越收缴日军武器的蒋介石军队，在美帝国主义者的指使下，企图推翻越南民主共和国政府，扶植叛国的越南国民党起来掌握政权。越南民主共和国在其诞生之初，就受到严重的威胁。
    当时，摆在我们面前的问题是如何摆脱国内外敌人所造成的十分艰难的景况，如何保持和巩固党所领导的人民民主政权，组织群众，发展力量，同时保持越、法两国人民和全世界人民所热爱的和平。在这种形势之下，胡志明主席和法国殖民主义者签订了一九四六年三月六日的初步协定和同年九月十四日的临时协定。
    越南政府诚实履行双方签订的协定，但是法国殖民主义者却蓄意破坏这些协定，一定要重新侵占我国。是谁在海防、北宁等地挑起各次冲突事件，并于一九四六年十一月、十二月间在河内的安宁街惨杀我们的同胞？正是法国殖民主义者。
    一九四六年，法国殖民主义者已经开始逐步实行“再征服越南”的计划。上述的各次挑衅，正是为了实现这种贪婪狠毒的计划。越南人民的抗战已于一九四五年九月二十三日在南部和中部南面进行。
    一九四六年十二月十九日开始的全国抗战，只是法国殖民主义者在越南所造成的这种形势的进一步发展而已。
    一九四六年十二月，越南人民站在两条路的交叉口。一条路是团结抗战，消灭法国殖民主义者，粉碎他们的“再征服越南”的阴谋；另一条路是仍旧作殖民主义者的奴隶。我们选择了第一条道路，用民族解放战争来保卫和发展八月革命的成果的抗战的道路。我们决心争取祖国的真正独立和完全统
    一，巩固并发展人民民主制度，保卫世界和平。
    越南革命的一个新发展时期开始了，这是我们民族的艰苦的但也是最光荣的时期。越南人民站在苏联所领导的和平民主社会主义阵营这一边，抵抗侵略我们的敌人法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者以及他们的走狗——叛国的越奸傀儡们。
    八月革命为越南人民带来了政权，但这个政权尚未巩固；八月革命建立了人民民主制度，但这个制度尚未健全。目前的抗战是一场革命战争，继承八月革命的事业，并推动越南人民的民族、民主革命前进。
    成绩和困难
    抗战开始的时候，胡志明主席和党已经向全体人民指出，我们的全部民族解放战争的方针是：“长期抗战，自力更生。”胡志明主席又常说：“抗战一定胜利，但必须是长期和艰苦的。”越南人民紧紧地掌握了这一方针，相信这一句话。因此，越南人民团结奋斗，决心粉碎敌人的一切贪婪狠毒的阴谋，并且在抗战中迅速地成长起来。
    在政治方面，法、美帝国主义侵略者知道越南抗战的力量是人民群众，而帝国主义者的弱点是它被人民仇恨，因此，他们竭力欺骗和离间越南民族，实行“用越南人打越南人”的恶毒政策。
    首先他们依靠着反动的封建大地主和买办资产阶级如保大、阮文心、阮第之流，在越南重新建立傀儡政权。在敌占区里，他们选择一批旧豪绅——多数是反动的富农和流氓分子，出来组织伪维持会，名之为“区委”或“乡委”，他们实行“扫荡”，强迫青年当兵，组织了各种伪军，名之为越南国家军队、保政团等等。
    他们指使披着宗教外衣的反动派，由间谍分子若安杜丽和民族叛徒阮友慈、吴庭淑等为首，进行欺骗和拉拢宗教徒，提出所谓“联宗反共”的口号，竭力拉拢天主教、基督教、佛教、和好教、高台教的教徒，企图建立反共战线，破坏我们的抗战工作，扰乱我们的后方。
    他们竭力收买和拉拢各少数民族，企图成立泰、芒等“自治国”，或者给中越边界的土匪空投武器，借以扰乱我们的人民政权。
    美国间谍头子海斯和法、美帝国主义者的特务们正在加紧进行间谍战。阮文心傀儡政府成立“平定招安部”，以便加紧收买、欺骗和离间我国人民。
    敌人的目的是“分而治之”。但是越南人民团结抗战，经常警觉。一九五一年三月三日，越盟和越联在全国范围内统一了，民族统一阵线从此称为越南国民联合战线（简称越联战线），它的政纲和组织条例，完全符合于劳动党在抗战期间的具体政策，从它的新政纲和组织条例看，越联战线很明显地是越南人民的一个广泛的政治组织。
    越南北部第三联区天主教的抗战运动，南部高朝发所领导的高台教抗战派以及许多地方的佛教救国组织，都加入越联战线。这证明法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者不能诱骗越南各宗教的教徒。
    东洋共产党为了避免遭受帝国主义者的致命打击，为了利于团结全民族进行抗战，有一段时间曾自动转入秘密（但宣布自动解散）；到了一九五一年二月十一日，党召开第二次全国代表大会，改组为越南劳动党。一九五一年三月三日，党以新的名义出现在人民面前，自此，党在各阶层人民中的影响日渐扩大和深入，党的领导权也日益巩固。
    事实是和敌人离间越南民族并孤立共产党的企图相反的。
    事实也是和敌人要把越南人民从世界爱好和平的人民中孤立起来的企图相反的。越南政府已获得苏联、中国及其他各人民民主国家的承认。越南人民和全世界人民，特别是和苏联、中国及朝鲜人民之间的联系日益紧密。以法国共产党为首的法国人民，日益加强斗争来反对侵略越南的战争。
    事实也是和敌人要离间越南、高棉、寮国三民族以便于把三国变成侵略中国的基地的企图相反的。三国人民日益紧密地团结在一九五一年三月成立的越、棉、寮联盟中，合力消灭共同的敌人。
    法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者对越南人民进行政治离间，是企图用军事力量来侵略我们。他们一方面在南部和中部南面进攻我们，同时又和我国政府签订初步协定，以便利用这个协定，和平进军北部和中部北面。一九四六年四月八日，当时的法国侵略军头子华露依曾命令法国远征军准备把这一次和平占领转变为一次“政变”，并用一些“别动队”逮捕越南的爱国者。
    法国殖民主义者企图重新侵占整个越南的阴谋已经昭然若揭。越南人民已实行全国抗战，决不会让法国殖民者和他们的奴才勃鲁姆与达尚里安等轻易实现其阴谋。
    抗战六年来，越南在军事和其他各方面都有长足的进步。越南部队由过去只有几个在政治上、装备上和斗争经验上都不够的中团（即团——译者），变成现在的具有民族、民主和人民性质的正规军，并将进一步现代化。目前，越南人民军已在使用缴获敌人的现代化武器来杀敌，建立了一些轰轰烈烈的战功。例如，一九四七年秋冬季的边界战役，歼敌六千；一九五○年秋冬季的边界战役，解放高平、谅山、老街、太原、和平五省，歼敌近万；一九五一年冬至一九五二年春的和平战役，在全北部及和平地区战场上歼敌两万余。自从全国抗战以来，我军已歼敌近二十二万。
    总结自己的经验和学习中国人民解放军的经验，努力学习胡志明主席的训示并深刻领会毛泽东的军事思想，越南人民军正在飞跃地进步着。部队的整训运动正热烈进行，并且已经收到许多良好的成绩。
    在进行军事侵略的同时，法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者还在经济方面竭力向我们进攻。为了实现“以战养战，用越南人打越南人”的阴谋，他们屡次发动“扫荡”，强征青年当兵，焚毁越南人民的庄稼。在敌占区里，农民要代替牲口来拖犁，因为耕牛都被敌人宰杀或吃掉了。最近，正当美国飞机在轰炸鸭绿江上的水电站的时候，法国飞机也轰炸我们的水利工程，使我们缺水耕种困难。
    此外，他们还用伪币收购我们的粮食，使我们的物价高涨。他们扫射、破坏我们的船只和交通运输线，使我们买卖困难。他们建立无人地带，使解放区和敌后地区的贸易被阻隔。
    敌人的目的是要打击我们各处供应的泉源，企图使我们的军民陷于饥饿，引起我们财政经济方面的困难。
    为了对付敌人，我们的政策是发展生产，统一财经管理，改革税制，整顿编制，发展国内和国际贸易，和敌人作经济斗争……。
    增产节约运动，今年已获得人民热烈的响应。我们的党、政、军、民机构从去年已经整顿编制，减少不必要的人员，增加生产的人力。供给标准已经明确规定，借以避免滥用。反贪污反浪费及反官僚主义的工作虽未像中国那样形成广泛的运动，但已从教育和检查工作开始。去年根据公平合理、鼓励生产和团结抗战的原则规定了征收农业税和工商业税，已经增加了国库方面的很大收入。国营贸易正在发展，供给人民以各种生活必需品如米、盐、布……等，并鼓励私人贸易、发展林产和土产方面的销售。
    为了培养人民——其中大多数是农民——的力量，抗战政府已没收法国殖民主义者和越奸的土地，分给贫苦农民，实行减租减息，重新分配公田，扩大信用贷款，贷给人民进行生产。截至一九五一年年初为止，全国已分配了二五三、八八二公顷土地给四二二、六四三个无地或少地的农民。五四、五一四个地主已经遵照政府的法令实行减租百分之二十五。大部分公田已经更公平地重新分配给十六岁以上的男女公民。一九五二年，政府拨出越币一百五十亿元信用贷款，贷给农民作为生产资本。上述的财经政策的目的是为了发展生产，保证供给，培养抗战和人民的力量。为了实现这一目的，政府的各种财政经济措施都正在为了达到平衡收支、稳定物价和巩固币值而努力。
    敌人十分阴险毒辣，我们的经济困难还多，但是靠着我国人民的团结和爱国精神，我们很可以达到上述财政经济方面的目的。
    在文化和社会方面，敌人为了易于侵略我国，正竭力推行其欺骗和愚民政策。他们一方面出版书报，宣传假独立统一；组织几次做样子的救济来为“美援”宣传；以奴隶的服从思想教育敌占区学校青年。另一方面，他们策划那些披着宗教外衣的反动派加强传教工作，占去教徒的时间和精神，使他们忽视抗战工作；他们劝诱教徒对侵略者的各种残杀、压迫、剥削行为忍辱妥协，来为拥护越盟的整个民族承担“罪孽”……；同时，他们强迫敌占区青年参加“扫荡”，并唆使他们进行奸淫烧杀，使我们的青年变成流氓；他们设立烟馆、赌馆和妓馆，放映诲淫诲盗的影片，使敌占区的青年腐化堕落。美帝国主义者在毒害敌占区青年的这些无耻行为中占着重要的地位。
    与法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者相反，越南政府的文化政策是组织和鼓励群众进行识字学习，七年来已经有一千四百万人脱离文盲的苦境；设立平民补习学校和工农速成学校，让工农干部和工、农、兵英雄模范补习文化；改革教育，实行九年制的普通学校，设立一年制的大学预备班，准备整顿大学，并开办各种专门技术学校。几年来，每一个国营工厂和越南总工会领导的工厂都是一个专门技术学校，培养了各种专门技术人材和学徒。
    我们的文学、科学和艺术，虽然缺点还多，但在抗战中都获得了发展。以“为人民服务”和“为抗战服务”为目的，越南文化已经踏上一条新的道路，人民民主的道路。在抗战中，许多封建殖民地时代的旧习俗都已改革或废除，新的生活、思想已经成为一个运动逐渐深入到人民的日常生活中。爱国主义竞赛创造了新的作风。胡志明主席的新教育方针：“勤俭廉正，大公无私”，已经逐步地渗透了干部和人民的日常工作和生活。
    虽然在印刷和发行方面的困难很多，但抗战书报仍经常出版，以爱国主义和仇恨帝国主义的思想来进行宣传和教育，其任务是动员人民参加抗战，争取祖国的完全独立和统一，并保卫世界和平。
    整训工作正在党内和部队中进行，并将在政府及越联战线的各个机关里普遍开始。这一工作具有极大的意义，它将使干部明确立场，认清国内、国外的敌和友，正确掌握“长期抗战，自力更生”的原则。
    一般地说，敌占区和游击区内的同胞是热爱祖国的。最近，敌后工作已经在逐步整顿中。在破坏工作、瓦解敌伪工作、游击战争、反“扫荡”、反拉丁拉夫、反抗敌人破坏庄稼……等方面也都已经收到很多良好的结果。
    总之，抗战七年是越南民主共和国长足进步的七年。但与上述的成绩和进步同时存在的，也还有许多必须克服的困难和缺点。
    有些困难是法、美帝国主义造成的，也有些困难是我们本身的缺点和错误所造成的。但一般地说，都是发展中的困难。目前存在着的较大缺点是干部思想不纯，整训运动的目的就是要改造党内、党外干部的思想。
    当前的任务
    我们的抗战正处在第二阶段，即相持阶段。相持阶段就是准备总反攻，以便争取最后胜利的阶段。
    去年年底，胡志明主席和党中央已提出党和政府目前的三大任务：
    一、消灭敌人的有生力量，大力推动游击战；
    二、粉碎敌人“以战养战，用越南人打越南人”的阴谋；
    三、培养人民和抗战的力量。
    完成上述三大任务，我们就会比敌人强，我们就能够转向总反攻。
    为了完成上述三大任务，目前，党要领导全体人民进行下列五项主要工作：
    一、增产节约；
    二、增强敌后工作；
    三、整党；
    四、整军；
    五、整顿群众工作。
    增产节约运动已收到初步效果。在解放区，许多家庭和村庄都按照计划进行生产。在各游击区和游击根据地，人民也响应政府的号召，参加增产节约运动，并使增产工作和抵抗敌人的“扫荡”与掠夺破坏等工作结合起来。
    现在，增产工作正与准备征收秋季农业税工作同时进行。
    人民日渐有意识地进行增加生产，以便改善个人的生活并为保证供应抗战的需要而贡献自己的一份力量。当部队在前方冲锋杀敌的时候，在后方工人、农民和脑力劳动者以人民民主国家的主人翁的态度，进行增产竞赛。
    一九五二年五月召开的全国英雄模范大会，表扬了我国的工、农、兵群众和进步知识分子的爱国和保卫世界和平的精神以及正确的工作和劳动态度。
    但是，由于我们的工业发展受到限制，因此，机器和工具比较缺乏，技术的改进受到许多阻碍。战争需要很多人力，敌后地区的青年被敌人拉丁拉夫，敌人还破坏庄稼、桥梁和堤坝，杀害耕牛……等，这些对生产都发生了一定的影响。
    今年，因为党和政府重视敌后工作，敌后工作已经大加整顿。经过和平战役，敌人的有生力量受到很大的损失，因而敌后工作更加有显著地发展的可能。目前，在越北平原上敌人残无人道地制造的无人区的后面，许多地方已经解放了，并且还建立了游击根据地。许多敌人的据点被人民武装包围着，以至于只能用飞机接济。在北部，我军有力地攻击敌人，敌人的精锐部队被吸引到北部；因此，在其他战场，例如平、治、天地区，第五联区和南部，我们的游击战也获得发展。目前，我们正在总结反“扫荡”经验，要使干部深刻体会“发展游击战以歼灭敌人的有生力量”的思想，以及“在敌后培养和积蓄力量”的思想。
    整党和整军工作正根据下述的方针进行：先整顿思想，后整顿组织；先整上级，后整下级；先整干部，后整一般党员和战士。整训工作目前正在紧张热烈地进行着，各部门和各级干部将轮流参加整训，以便改造思想，明确阶级立场和观点。用无产阶级的革命思想向各种非无产阶级思想，特别是小资产阶级思想进行斗争。
    整训工作是一场激烈的思想斗争。最初的几期整训班已经收到良好的效果。干部经过整训之后，即开始整顿群众工作——主要是农民运动工作。支部和政权机关在整顿群众工作的过程中同时整顿。
    保卫世界和平运动是目前各国共产党和工人党的中心工作之一，我们进行得怎样呢？敌人企图侵占我国作为进攻中国的基地并进而发动第三次世界大战。我们的抗战正打击着敌人的这种阴谋。所以，我们在抗战中的每一件工作都是保卫世界和平的最切实的工作。在我们，杀敌、增产、整党、整军等等，都有保卫世界和平的意义。因此，我们要把要求缔结五大国和平公约的签名运动、反对美帝国主义者武装日本和西德、反对美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战、响应召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议等工作和我们的抗战紧密地结合起来。我们的国际任务和民族任务就是这样紧密地结合着。我们打击侵略者，不仅为了争取祖国的独立和人民的自由，而且也为了保卫世界和平民主。
    结论
    回顾越南民主共和国七年来所走过的道路，我们可以明白：
    一、由于苏联在第二次世界大战中打败了日本法西斯主义者，越南人民获得了夺取政权的良好机会。东南亚第一次出现了一个民主共和国，它是在一个殖民地半封建国家的基础上建立起来的。这个共和国实行人民民主专政。越南的人民民主专政是人民中的各革命阶级——工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和一部分爱国进步的士绅——对帝国主义侵略者——法国殖民主义者和美国侵略者——以及他们的走狗反动的封建大地主和买办资产阶级的专政。
    越南人民民主专政的历史任务是消灭帝国主义侵略者，发展人民民主，使越南走向社会主义。
    二、要使革命成功，必须集合民族统一阵线的一切力量（越联战线），成立人民解放军，进行武装斗争，抵抗帝国主义侵略者和越奸傀儡。民族统一阵线和人民解放军必须由工人阶级的革命政党（越南劳动党）领导。
    同时，国内的民族民主革命运动必须和苏联所领导的世界和平、民主和社会主义运动密切联系。
    三、越南革命是民族革命和民主革命紧密结合，革命动力是工人阶级所领导的、以工农联盟为基础的越南人民。因此，我们称越南革命为人民民族民主革命。革命的根本任务是反帝反封建。
    这两重任务互相连结，不能分离。目前越南革命的中心任务是争取民族解放。这一任务包含有反帝和反封建性质，因为要打倒帝国主义侵略者，同时必须打倒他们的走狗反动的封建势力。越南民族的抗战是一种最激烈的革命斗争。年轻的越南民主共和国经过这一次伟大的考验，正在迅速地成长起来。
    越南革命决不中途停止，而且将由人民民族民主革命转成社会主义革命。越南必将由人民民主的道路进入社会主义，决不走任何别的道路。
    我们必将粉碎法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者安置在越南人民前进道路上的一切反动力量。
