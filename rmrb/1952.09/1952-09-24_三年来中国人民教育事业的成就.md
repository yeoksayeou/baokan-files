Achievements of China's People's Education Undertakings in the Past Three Years
Minister of Education of the Central People's Government Ma Xulun

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will soon be held in our capital, which is a major event in the great world peace movement, and a grand gathering for hundreds of millions of people in the Asian and Pacific regions to unite more closely in order to strive for peace, freedom, independence, and a happy life. At the same time, the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is also approaching. This is a great festival for the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to defeat the joint forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism and stand up like giants. It is a great festival for the Chinese people to move from darkness to light and from disaster to happiness. In order to celebrate the opening of this peace conference and to welcome the National Day, I think it is very meaningful to review the achievements of China's people's education undertakings over the past three years.

The founding of the People's Republic of China ushered in a new era in Chinese history.

As everyone knows, the disasters inflicted on the Chinese people by long-term national and feudal oppression were extremely profound. The corrupt and utterly degenerate Kuomintang traitorous and corrupt government left behind an economically and culturally backward country, and the legacy of education was particularly pitiful. The broad masses of workers and peasants were deprived of the right to education, 90 percent of the population was illiterate, and feudal, comprador, and fascist education devastated the self-esteem and self-confidence of young people. In the areas ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, one could see everywhere young people using what they had not learned, unemployed after graduation, suffering, wandering, and degenerating. The situation was very tragic.

In the past three years, the liberated Chinese people have united as one around the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, followed the path of New Democracy, and implemented fundamental political, economic, and social reforms. Great victories have been continuously achieved in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, ideological remolding, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Brilliant achievements have been made in the restoration and construction of economic undertakings. At the same time, in order to raise the people's political awareness and cultural level, and to train cadres for national construction, China's people's education undertakings have also experienced rapid development and progress.

In the winter of 1949, when the People's Republic of China was first founded, there were 191 institutions of higher learning in the country, with more than 130,000 students; more than 5,200 secondary schools, with more than 1.27 million students; and more than 346,700 primary schools, with more than 24.2 million students.

In the past three years, education at all levels has developed on a large scale. Comparing only the number of students: the number of primary school students increased by 77 percent by 1951, and by more than 101 percent after the summer vacation this year, that is, more than doubled, and the number of students enrolled will reach more than 49 million; the number of secondary school students increased by 57.9 percent by 1951, and by 142.2 percent after the summer vacation this year, that is, increased by one and a half times, and the number of students enrolled can reach 3,078,000; the number of students in institutions of higher learning increased by 34.8 percent by 1951, and by 69 percent after the summer vacation this year, and the number of students enrolled can reach 219,700. Compared with the figures of the highest year (1946) during the Kuomintang rule, the number of primary school students increased by 107 percent, the number of secondary school students increased by 63.9 percent, and the number of students in institutions of higher learning increased by 69.9 percent.

The Central People's Government is particularly concerned about the education of ethnic minorities. The five newly established national colleges have reached 8,800 students. The number of middle school students this year increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and the number of elementary school students increased by 11 percent compared to last year; among them, the Korean ethnic group in the Northeast region, which was liberated earlier, has achieved 92 percent enrollment of school-age children, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved 70 percent enrollment of school-age children. Some ethnic minorities do not have written languages, and we are creating written languages for them to develop their culture.

In terms of workers' and peasants' spare-time education, the number of students enrolled in spare-time schools for workers has reached more than 2 million in 1951, and has reached 3,020,000 in August this year. The number of students enrolled in spare-time schools for peasants has reached 14 million in 1951, and is expected to reach more than 24 million this year. The number of students enrolled in winter schools in rural areas has reached more than 42 million in 1951, and is expected to reach 50 million this winter. What should be particularly mentioned here is that Comrade Qi Jianhua has created a rapid literacy method, which will greatly shorten the process of eliminating illiteracy among hundreds of millions of workers and peasants. At present, governments at all levels are vigorously promoting the rapid literacy method, training teachers, and actively preparing to carry out a large-scale literacy campaign. It is estimated that more than 10 million illiterate workers, peasants, cadres, industrial workers, and young and middle-aged peasants will be eliminated this winter and spring.

The above facts show that the development of education in the new China has far exceeded the achievements of the twenty years of reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

The development of people's education is inseparable from the reform of the old education. In the past three years, the People's Government has resolutely, systematically and step by step carried out the work of reforming the old education in all aspects.

First, is the reform of the education system. In October 1951, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Reforming the Education System," which stipulates a new education system that is completely in line with the actual situation in the initial stage of China's construction. The basic spirit of the new education system is: to determine the important position of the education of the working people and workers and peasants cadres in the education system at all levels, to ensure that the working people have the opportunity to receive education; to determine the important position of professional education, and to stipulate the status of training courses, supplementary schools, and political schools at all levels and types, so as to continuously supply the talents needed for national construction; primary schools will implement a five-year consistent system, so that the children of urban and rural working people can receive complete elementary education. In addition, school systems at all levels and types are connected to each other and communicate with each other, and can gradually achieve that all roads lead to university. All people, as long as they work hard, have the opportunity to receive higher education.

Second, all educational facilities are open to the working class. In order to make education truly become the education of the people, all levels of schools have implemented the policy of opening to the working class, and have given working class youth as much convenience as possible to enroll. In particular, the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Primary Schools, Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle Schools, Workers Political Schools and Renmin University of China were established to absorb workers and peasant cadres and industrial workers to enroll. At present, the proportion of workers and peasants in primary schools across the country has reached more than 80 percent; among middle school students, the proportion of workers and peasants has reached about 60 percent; among college students, the proportion of workers and peasants has reached more than 20 percent. These are all unprecedented phenomena in Chinese history.

Third, the transformation of teachers' thinking. Due to the development of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought education, teachers at all levels of schools, in order to "contribute better things to the workers," are responding to Chairman Mao's call and have widely launched an ideological transformation movement of self-education, learning new ideas, new viewpoints, and new methods, criticizing old ideas, old viewpoints, and old methods, using the method of criticism and self-criticism, pursuing truth, correcting mistakes, and drawing a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and drawing a clear line between the ideas of the working class and the bourgeoisie. After this study movement, the ranks of people's teachers have become purer and their work enthusiasm is higher. Now everyone is consciously learning from the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union, combining it with China's actual situation, revising various teaching plans, subject syllabuses, and further adapting subject textbooks; further reforming educational content and teaching methods, and has already made preliminary achievements, which guarantees that the quality of people's education will continue to improve.

Fourth, the adjustment of departments in schools. In order to eliminate the anarchic state and the situation of being divorced from reality in the distribution of school settings and the division of departments in old China, and to make people's education more effectively serve national construction, the People's Government has focused on adjusting the departments of colleges and universities in the past three years. This year, the adjustment of national institutes of technology, agricultural colleges, normal colleges, comprehensive universities, and industrial technical schools can be basically completed. The number of higher industrial schools will be expanded from 31 to 47. The number of agricultural and forestry colleges will be expanded from 18 to 33, the number of normal colleges will be expanded from 30 to 34, and the number of medical colleges will be expanded from 29 to 32. After the adjustment, the proportion of engineering in national colleges and universities will be greatly increased. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in 1946, students in engineering colleges in national colleges and universities accounted for only 18.9 percent, and after the summer vacation this year, the number of students in engineering colleges reached 35.4 percent of the total number of students in colleges and universities, ranking first among all subjects. The enrollment quota of secondary industrial technical schools accounts for more than 38 percent of the enrollment quota of secondary specialized schools, also ranking first. Such a change creates good conditions for our country's industrialization in terms of training technical talents.

Fifth, the political status of teachers and students has been improved, and their living conditions have been improved. In the new China, teachers who are willing to serve the people are respected by the government and loved by the masses; young students are regarded as the hope of the new China and are cared for by the People's Government. They have universally established their own mass organizations - education trade unions or student unions. Representatives participate in the People's Governments and People's Congresses at all levels, and they widely and freely participate in social and political life as masters of the country. Regarding the living treatment of teachers and young students, this year, with the fundamental improvement of the country's financial and economic situation, adjustments and improvements have been made across the board. Compared with last year, the average wage standard for teachers at all levels of schools has increased by 18.6 percent for college teachers, 25.5 percent for middle school teachers, and 37.4 percent for elementary school teachers. At the same time, the People's Scholarship for students in secondary schools and above has been greatly increased. All students in secondary technical schools, normal schools, and colleges and universities receive the People's Scholarship every month, and workers and peasants who enroll in school receive a larger amount of the People's Scholarship every month. In this way, not only is the food cost of all students in secondary technical schools, normal schools, and colleges and universities provided by the state, but it can also solve the problem of their other living expenses. Therefore, the current students and teachers can study and work with peace of mind for the construction of the motherland, for the welfare of the people, and for a better future for mankind.

In the past three years, we have fundamentally changed the semi-colonial and semi-feudal educational situation in old China, and the entire national education authorities and education undertakings have completely belonged to the people and have become tools for serving the people. This has promoted the fundamental change in the spiritual life of the people across the country. An ordinary person has also recognized who is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and who is the most loyal friend of the Chinese people. Opposing imperialist aggression, opposing feudal reactionary forces, uniting international friends, and creating an independent, peaceful, democratic, and free and happy life with their own labor, this kind of thinking and this kind of confidence have taken root in the hearts of the broad masses. Tens of thousands of workers, peasants, and working women who have never been able to read are now able to read newspapers, read books, and widely participate in social activities. Tens of thousands of senior construction talents and hundreds of thousands of intermediate construction talents have graduated from schools, and under the unified distribution of the People's Government, they have consciously embarked on the posts of national construction according to the needs of the country and their personal talents. The liberated Chinese people's rich creativity has been freely developed, and heroic models have emerged everywhere.

In the past three years, the creative power of hundreds of millions of organized people engaged in peaceful and constructive labor has been astonishing. In the era of old China, imperialism and reactionary ruling forces personally created the "poverty" and "ignorance" of the Chinese people, and they turned around and laughed at the Chinese people's "cultural backwardness." That kind of era will never come again.

The development and achievements of China's people's education fully demonstrate the superiority of the new democratic system over the capitalist system, and also demonstrate the strong vitality of the people's democratic regime. At present, our country is preparing to carry out large-scale and planned economic construction and cultural construction. Our country must move towards industrialization. With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, there will undoubtedly be an unprecedented cultural upsurge; in the future, the task of educational construction will be even more arduous. Let us all education workers and all the people unite more closely and work harder to complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the country, to build a more prosperous and powerful great motherland, and to strive to consolidate peace in Asia and the world!

    三年来中国人民教育事业的成就
    中央人民政府教育部部长  马叙伦
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，不久就要在我国首都举行，这是伟大的世界和平运动中的一件大事，这是亚洲及太平洋区域的亿万人民为了争取和平、自由、独立、幸福的生活而更加团结起来的盛会。同时，中华人民共和国成立三周年的国庆节也即将到来，这是中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，击败了国民党反动派和美帝国主义的联合力量，像巨人一样地站立了起来的伟大节日，是中国人民从黑暗走向光明、从灾难走向幸福的伟大节日。为了庆祝这次和平会议的召开，为了迎接国庆节的到来，让我们回顾三年来中国人民教育事业的成就，我想是很有意义的。
    中华人民共和国的宣告成立，在中国历史上揭开了一个新的纪元。
    大家都知道：长期的民族压迫和封建压迫所给予中国人民的灾难是异常深重的。腐朽透顶的国民党卖国贪污政权所留下来的是一个经济、文化落后的国家，教育事业的遗产尤其可怜。广大的工农劳动人民被剥夺了受教育的权利，百分之九十的人是文盲，封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的教育摧残了青年们的自尊心和自信心。在国民党反动派统治地区，到处都可以看到所用非所学、毕业即失业、苦闷徬徨、流浪堕落的青年，情况是很悲惨的。
    三年来，解放了的中国人民，一致团结在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的周围，遵循着新民主主义的道路，实行了政治、经济和社会的根本的改革。抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、思想改造和“三反”“五反”运动不断地取得伟大胜利，恢复和建设经济事业已有了辉煌成就。同时为了提高人民的政治觉悟和文化水平，为了培养国家的建设干部，中国人民教育事业，也有了迅速的发展和进步。
    一九四九年冬天，当中华人民共和国初成立的时候，全国有高等学校一百九十一所，学生十三万多人；有中等学校五千二百余所，学生一百二十七万多人；有小学校三十四万六千七百余所，学生二千四百二十多万人。
    三年来各级学校教育都有了大规模的发展，单就学生人数来比较：小学学生到一九五一年增加了百分之七十七，到今年暑假后则增加百分之一百零一，即增加了一倍多，在校学生将达到四千九百余万人；中等学校学生，到一九五一年增加了百分之五十七点九，到今年暑假后则增加百分之一百四十二点二，即增加了一倍半，在校学生可达到三百零七万八千人；高等学校学生到一九五一年增加了百分之三十四点八，到今年暑假后则增加了百分之六十九，在校学生可达到二十一万九千七百人。若和国民党统治时期最高一年（一九四六年）的数字比较，则小学生增加了百分之一百零七，中等学校学生增加了百分之六十三点九，高等学校学生增加了百分之六十九点九。
    中央人民政府对少数民族的教育特别关心，新创办的五所民族学院，学生已达到八千八百人。中学生今年比去年增加了百分之二十七，小学生比去年增加了百分之十一；其中解放较早的东北区朝鲜民族，学龄儿童入学的已达到百分之九十二，内蒙古自治区学龄儿童入学的已达到百分之七十。有些少数民族没有文字，我们正在为他们创造文字，来发展他们的文化。
    在工农业余教育方面，职工业余学校入学人数，一九五一年已达到二百万人以上，今年八月已达到三百零二万人。农民业余学校入学人数，一九五一年已达到一千四百万人，今年预计可达到二千四百余万人。农村冬学的入学人数，一九五一年已达到四千二百余万人，今冬预计可达到五千万人。这里应该特别提出的是：祁建华同志创造了速成识字法，将大大地缩短扫除亿万工农文盲的过程。现在各级人民政府正大力推广速成识字法，训练师资，积极准备开展大规模的扫除文盲运动。预计今冬明春即可扫除工农干部、产业工人、青壮年农民中的文盲一千余万人。
    以上的事实说明，新中国教育事业的发展，已远远地超过了国民党反动统治时期二十年的成就。
    人民教育事业的发展是和改革旧的教育事业分不开的。三年来，人民政府坚决地、有计划有步骤地从各方面进行了改革旧教育的工作。
    第一，是关于学制的改革。一九五一年十月中央人民政府政务院颁布了“关于改革学制的决定”，规定了完全切合中国建设初期实际情况的新学制。新学制的基本精神是：确定劳动人民和工农干部教育在各级学校教育系统中的重要地位，保证劳动人民有受教育的机会；确定专业教育的重要地位，规定了各级各类训练班、补习学校和政治学校的地位，以便不断地供应国家建设所需要的人才；小学改行五年一贯制，使城乡劳动人民的子女都能够受到完全的初等教育。此外各级各类学校系统又是互相衔接，彼此沟通，可以逐步做到条条大道通大学。全体人民，只要自己努力，谁都有受高等教育的机会。
    第二，是所有教育设施都向工农劳动人民开门。为了使教育事业真正成为人民大众的教育，各级学校都贯彻了向工农开门的方针，尽量给工农青年以入学的方便。并且特别创办了工农速成初等学校、工农速成中学、工人政治学校和中国人民大学，吸收工农干部和产业工人入学。目前全国初等学校学生中，工农成份已达到百分之八十以上；中等学校学生当中，工农成份已达到百分之六十左右；高等学校学生中，工农成份已达到百分之二十以上。这都是中国历史上空前未有的现象。
    第三，是教师思想的改造。由于马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想教育的发展，各级学校教师，为了“把更好的东西贡献给劳动者”，正在响应毛主席的号召，广泛地掀起了自我教育的思想改造运动，学习新思想、新观点、新方法，批判旧思想、旧观点、旧方法，用批评与自我批评的方法，追求真理，修正错误，划清了敌我界限，划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限。经过这次学习运动，人民教师的队伍是更加纯洁了，工作积极性更高了。现在大家正自觉地学习苏联的先进教育经验，结合着中国的实际情况，改订各种教学计划、各科教学大纲和进一步地改编各科教材；进一步地改革教育内容和教学方法，并已经有了初步的成就，这就保证了人民教育的质量将继续提高。
    第四，是学校的院系的调整。为了消灭旧中国在学校设置分布和科系分工上那种无政府状态和脱离实际的情况，使人民教育事业，更有效地为国家建设服务，三年来，人民政府曾有重点地进行了高等学校院系的调整工作。今年可以基本上完成全国工学院、农学院、师范学院、综合大学和工业技术学校的调整工作。高等工业学校将由三十一所扩充到四十七所。农林院校将由十八所扩充到三十三所，师范院校将由三十所扩充到三十四所，医药院校将由二十九所扩充到三十二所。经过调整之后，全国高等学校工科的比重将大大的提高。在一九四六年国民党反动统治时期，全国高等学校工学院的学生只占百分之十八点九，今年暑假后，工学院学生人数达到高等学校学生总数的百分之三十五点四，占各科学生数的第一位。中等工业技术学校招生名额占中等专业学校招生名额的百分之三十八以上，也是占第一位。这样的改变，就为我们国家的工业化，在培养技术人才方面，创造了良好的条件。
    第五，是提高了教师和学生的政治地位，改善了他们的生活状况。在新中国，凡是愿意为人民服务的教师，都受到了政府的尊重和人民的敬爱；青少年学生，更是被看做新中国的希望，而受到人民政府的关怀。他们普遍地建立了自己的群众性的组织——教育工会或学生会，各级人民政府和人民代表会议都有他们的代表参加，他们以国家主人翁的地位，广泛地、自由地参加了社会政治生活。关于教师和青年学生的生活待遇，今年，随着国家财政经济情况的根本好转，又普遍地进行了调整和提高。各级学校教师的平均工资标准，和去年比较，高等学校教师工资增加了百分之十八点六，中等学校教师工资增加了百分之二十五点五，初等学校教师工资增加了百分之三十七点四。同时，大大增加了中等以上学校学生的人民助学金。所有中等技术学校、师范学校和高等学校的学生，百分之百每月都得到人民助学金，工农干部和产业工人入学的，每人每月发给数量较多的人民助学金。这样不仅做到了中等技术学校、师范学校和高等学校全部学生的伙食费都由国家供给，还可以解决他们其他生活费用的问题。因此，现在的学生和教师们，可以为了祖国的建设、为了人民的福利、为了人类更美好的将来而安心地学习和工作了。
    三年来，我们根本改变了旧中国半殖民地、半封建的教育状况，整个国家的教育机关和教育事业，已经是完全属于人民，成为为人民服务的工具了。这样就促进了全国人民精神生活的根本变化。一个普通的人民，也认清了谁是中国人民最凶恶的敌人，谁是中国人民最忠实的朋友。反对帝国主义侵略，反对封建反动势力，团结国际友人，用自己的劳动创造独立、和平、民主、自由的美满生活，这种思想，这种信心，已经在广大群众的心里生了根。成千上万的，一向不识字的工人、农民、劳动妇女，今天已能看报、读书、广泛地参加了社会活动。几万高级建设人才，几十万中级建设人才，已经从学校里毕了业，按照国家的需要和个人的才能，在人民政府统一分配下，自觉地走上了祖国建设的岗位。解放了的中国人民，丰富的创造力得到了自由的发展，英雄模范到处涌现。
    三年来，组织起来的亿万人民的创造力量，从事和平的建设性的劳动的成就，是惊人的。在旧中国的时代里，帝国主义和反动统治势力，亲手制造了中国人民的“贫困”和“愚昧”，他们回过头来又嘲笑中国人民“文化落后”，那种时代，是永远不会再来了。
    中国人民教育事业的发展和成就，充分地证明了新民主主义制度较之资本主义制度的优越性，也证明了人民民主政权有着如何强有力的生命力。现在，我们的国家正准备开展大规模的、有计划的经济建设和文化建设。我们的国家一定要走向工业化。随着经济建设高潮的到来，无疑的将出现一个空前的文化高潮；今后教育建设的任务，是更加艰巨的。让我们全国教育工作者和全体人民一道，更加团结努力，为了完成国家所交付我们的光荣任务，为了建设更加强盛的伟大祖国，为了巩固亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗吧！（新华社）
