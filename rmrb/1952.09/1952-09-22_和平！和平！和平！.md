Peace! Peace! Peace!
　　Huang Yanpei
　　The great people's peace movement is unfolding step by step from every corner of the Earth, near and far, towards the whole world, and is uniting group after group. Peace! Peace! It is naturally shouted out in all human languages, becoming the loudest noun. It is hard to find a person who does not welcome peace from the bottom of their heart, unless they are a warmonger.
　　Most of humanity seeks peace, so how can there still be people in the world who believe in war, create war, and launch war? How has there been constant war throughout history? I would like to add: precisely because all of humanity seeks peace and dislikes war, a great history tells me: the end of all warmongers in the world is tragic. Past facts are sufficient to prove this.
　　Since the publication of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference initiation letter in March this year, one of the five major peace movement regions on Earth, in less than a few months, on land in Asia, and on the water of the Pacific, east, west, north and south, a tide of peace has simultaneously risen. Peace Weeks, Peace Months, and Peace Festivals are being held in many countries. Every country, all people seeking survival, are coordinating with their different environments for this peace movement, either enthusiastically responding and participating, or cautiously preparing to participate, or risking their lives to strive to participate. There is a lot of resistance in this, where does it come from? It is because some people are worried, resentful, and terrified by the word "peace," and are trying every means to sabotage it. Who are these people? They are warmongers.
　　Unfortunately, in this region, it cannot be said that peace is being maintained, it can only be said that peace is being rescued, because there are blatantly unreasonable and unpeaceful events happening right in front of our eyes in this Asian territory and on the Pacific Ocean. Everyone sees the United States, which calls itself the world's top power, gathering several vassal states and fiercely attacking Korea, a country that is small in territory, small in population, but absolutely unwilling to submit to the violent. In its immediate neighbor, the people of the People's Republic of China, which has already stood up, seeing the plight of their brother country, and even more seeing that part of their territory, Taiwan, is being invaded, and even more seeing the fierce front approaching the Yalu River on the border, the vast masses have risen together to save their neighbors and save themselves. The powerful countries were defeated by them and could not step down. Let's talk about peace! Shyly, they lose face, and are not reconciled. Let's have a big battle! They don't have the strength, their partners disagree, and the people at home are making trouble. What to do! Such a stalemate is in front of us. People all over the world unanimously believe that the war provoked by the warmongers is too unreasonable and inhumane, and everyone has expressed enthusiastic sympathy and a strong sense of justice for the people suffering from the war. In the midst of these intertwined emotions, suddenly hearing someone shouting, "Peace," they naturally answered in unison:
　　"Peace"! "Peace"! "Peace"!
　　Is shouting peace effective? It is effective. The peep show is punctured with one poke. Warmongers must have three kinds of people to cooperate in order to fight a war: the first kind are those who manufacture weapons, and the second kind are those who have these weapons. The purpose of the first kind of people is only to make money, and the second kind of people collude with the first kind of people, and their ambitions explode. "Great! With these weapons, why don't we let ourselves invade the world happily, can't we dominate, isn't it good!" However, a large number of the third kind of people are still needed to help. Help with what? Taking up weapons. The more weapons there are, the more people are needed to take them up. A large number of the third kind of people are intoxicated by the propaganda and deception of the second kind of people, shouting with them to fight! fight! Suddenly, the banner of peace was raised high on the Pacific Ocean, and everyone woke up, making money is their business, it has nothing to do with us, domination is their business, it has nothing to do with us, what is the reward we get for taking up weapons? Trauma, disability, death. Is there such a thing in the world! Using the trauma, disability, and death of the majority of people to exchange for the wealth and domination of the very few; using the blood of the majority of people to fill the greedy and violent desires of the very few, it is really "utterly unreasonable."
　　For the sake of a very few people's wealth and domination, it is also necessary to directly and indirectly plunder wealth from the heads of a larger number of people to make them the capital to fight their wars, making a larger number of people increase their endless burdens. "Fighting"! Who are we fighting for? Why are we fighting? Thinking it through thoroughly, only fools will supply and help them, are you still not awake!
　　The first and second kinds of people worry about peace, resent peace, fear peace, and try every means to sabotage peace. The third kind of people are absolutely willing to respond to peace, maintain peace, and, when necessary, use great force to save peace. Please see who the former are and who the latter are since the publication of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference initiation letter! Isn't the fact already sufficiently proven! It must be known that the first two kinds of people are a very small number, and the latter accounts for the vast majority.
　　Coincidentally, in the Asian territory and on the Pacific Ocean, there is a country - Japan, which will give us a good psychological test opportunity for the peace movement. This country - Japan, a few years ago, the third kind of people mentioned above were subjected to the propaganda and deception of the first and second kinds of people, and beat everyone they met in the surrounding countries, inciting a world war, and as a result failed and surrendered their arms. Not long after, another country, namely the United States, which calls itself the world's first-class power and was defeated by others, the first and second kinds of people in the middle saw that the third kind of people in this country - Japan could still fight, and they were suffering from a lack of hitmen, so they began to propagandize and deceive them. Originally, this other country - the United States was the one who had once cruelly massacred a large number of innocent people in this country - Japan during the war. After the surrender, they are still unreasonably oppressing and insulting the good people of this country - Japan. Now, they are using clever words to deceive and even force the third kind of people in this country - Japan to take up weapons and follow them to fight a war that is too inhumane and unreasonable. What is the response of these third kind of people! Please see!
　　Unless the third kind of people in this country are all fools, otherwise, how can they not think that making a fortune and dominating are your business, we only have trauma, disability, and death. The pain of war that was brought to us a few years ago has not yet disappeared, has not yet been forgotten, and we have to fight for you again. The first and second kinds of people who deceived us in the past were from our own country, now they are foreigners, and they are also the enemies who massacred us. We are not fools, we fully understand, we will answer you and warn you by responding to peace.
　　Therefore, the large-scale mass peace movement in this country - Japan has spread widely. In terms of political views, from liberals to communists; in terms of trade unions, from trade unions in the General Council system to trade unions in the industrial system; in terms of industry, from large entrepreneurs to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators; in terms of religious groups, from Buddhists to Christians, all of the above broad strata are expressing their support for this peace conference. What is the result? Please see!
　　Peace is humane, peace is just, and an appeal that conforms to humanity
　　will surely be responded to by all mankind; a struggle that conforms to justice will surely achieve final victory.
　　Peace! Peace! "Once theory is grasped by the masses, it immediately becomes a material force." 1952, 9, 15. (Xinhua News Agency)

    和平！和平！和平！
    黄炎培
    伟大的人民和平运动，从地球每一角落里由近及远地向着全世界在一步一步展开，同时在一群一群结合。和平！和平！很自然地在人类所有语言里喊出来，成为最响亮的名词。很难找出一个人，对和平不是内心表示欢迎的，除非好战者。
    人类多在求和平，怎么世界上还有人在迷信战争，制造战争，发动战争？怎么历史上还不断地战争？我愿接下去说一句：就为人类都在求和平，都不喜欢战争，所以一部大历史告诉我：全世界好战者的下场，没有一个不悲惨的。过去的事实足够证明了。
    自从今年三月，全地球五大和平运动区域之一亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议发起书公布以来，不到几个月，陆上的亚洲，水面的太平洋，东西南北，同时掀起和平的怒潮。和平周、和平月、和平节，在许多国家中间举行着。每一个国家，凡在求生存的人民，对这和平运动，都在配合着他们不同的环境，或热烈地响应参加，或审慎地准备着参加，或拚着生命在争取参加。这中间不少阻力，从那里来的呢？就为了有种人见和平两字而忧虑、忿恨、恐怖，想尽方法在破坏。是那种人？是好战者。
    不幸得很，在这区域里，不能说是维护和平了，只能说是拯救和平了，为的是在这亚洲境内，太平洋上边摆在面前明明白白地有太不合理的不和平事件存在。大家眼看到一个自封为世界第一等强国的美国，纠合了几个仆从国家，向着那个地方小、人口少、但绝对不肯向强暴者屈服的国家——朝鲜，恶狠狠地打，打之不休。在它的紧邻，已经站立起来的中华人民共和国的人民，看到兄弟国家这样的遭遇，更看到一部分国土台湾被侵占，更看到凶锋一步一步逼近了国境鸭绿江，广大的群众一齐起来救邻自救。强国给它们打败了，下不了台。讲和吧！羞答答地没面子，不甘心。大战一场吧！没气力，伙计们不同意，家里老百姓又在闹。怎么办呢！摆在面前这样一种僵局。全世界人们一致地认为，好战者挑起的战祸，太没理由了，太不人道了，大家对遭受战祸的人民发出了狂热的同情心和浓厚的正义感。正在这些情绪交织之下，忽然听到有人喊着：“和平”，很自然地异口同声地答应着：
    “和平”！“和平”！“和平”！
    和平喊起来有效么？有效。西洋镜一戳就穿的，好战者要打仗必须三种人配合起来：第一种制造凶器的人，第二种有这些凶器的人，第一种人目的只在发财，第二种人和第一种人勾结着，野心便勃发起来了，“好！有这些凶器，为什么不让我们在世界上痛痛快快地侵略一下，可以称霸，不好么！”但是，还需要大量的第三种人来帮助。帮助什么？拿凶器。凶器越多，需要拿的人越多。大量的第三种人陶醉在第二种人宣传、欺骗中间，跟他们喊着打！打！忽然太平洋上高高地揭起和平的旗帜，大家觉悟起来了，发财是他们的事，与我们无干，称霸是他们的事，于我们无干，我们拿凶器者所得到的报酬是什么？创伤、残废、死亡。天下有这样道理！把大多数人的创伤、残废、死亡，来换取极少数人的发财和称霸；把大多数人的血，来填满极少数人贪暴的欲海，真是“岂有此理”。
    为了极少数的人发财、称霸，还需要直接、间接地向更广大数量的人们头上去搜括财富，拿来做他们打仗的本钱，使得更广大数量的人们，增加无穷的负担。“打仗”！究竟为谁打呢？为什么而打呢？彻底一想，那只有傻子去供给他们、帮助他们的了，还不觉悟么！
    第一、第二种人忧虑和平，忿恨和平，害怕和平，想尽方法在破坏和平。第三种人绝对乐意响应和平，维护和平，必要时用大力来拯救和平。请看亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议发起书公布以来，前者是那些人？后者是那些人？事实不已经足够地证明了么！须知前两种是极少数人，后一种占绝大多数。
    恰巧地在亚洲境内太平洋上边，有一个国家——日本将给我们和平运动以很好的心理测验的机会。这个国家——日本在几年以前，上文所说第三种人受了第一、第二种人的宣传、欺骗，向它周围的国家，逢人便打，激起了世界大战，结果失败了，缴械投降了。不久，另一个国家即自封为世界第一等强国而给人家打败了的国家——美国，中间第一、第二种人看到这一国家——日本第三种人还能够打仗，自己正在苦闷着缺乏打手的时候，向他们宣传、欺骗起来了，原来这另一国家——美国就是当时大战中间曾经高度残忍地屠杀这一国家——日本的大量无辜人民的。在投降以后，还在无理压迫侮弄这一国家——日本善良人民的。现在倒用巧言来欺骗、还用强力来胁迫这一国家——日本第三种人，要求他们拿着凶器跟着他们打太不人道、太没理由的仗。这第三种人反应怎么样呢！请看吧！
    除非这一国家第三种人都是傻子，否则他们难道想不到发财、称霸是你们的事，我们只有创伤、残废、死亡。几年以前，带给我们的战争苦痛，还没有消灭，还没有忘记，又要替你们打仗，从前欺骗我们的第一、第二种人，还是本国的，现在是外国的，而且就是屠杀我们的敌人，我们不是傻子，我们完全了解，我们且把响应和平来答复你们、警告你们。
    于是这一国家——日本大规模的群众性的和平运动普遍地展开了，就政治主张来说，从自由主义者到共产主义者；就工会来说，从总评系统的工会到产别系统的工会；就产业界来说，从大实业家到中小工商业者；就宗教团体来说，从佛教徒到基督教徒，以上这样广泛的阶层中，都在表示支持这一和平会议。结果怎样？请看！
    和平是人道的，和平是正义的，合乎人道的号召，
    一定会获得全人类的响应；合乎正义的斗争，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    和平！和平！“理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量”。一九五二、九、十五。（新华社）
