    Xi'an County People's Court Conducts Preliminary Examination of Old Legal Views

    Comrade Editor: Our Xi'an County People's Court in Liaodong Province has begun judicial reform. Although none of our personnel have worked in the old judicial system, we are constantly influenced by old legal views. This is primarily reflected in our unclear understanding of the essence of law and our ambiguous stance, leading to a purely legal perspective that transcends class and politics. Consequently, in sentencing, we exhibit leniency and vacillation. For example, Jiang Dunfa, a former village head, embezzled the fruits and wages that poor peasant Song Xihe received during the land reform. Song repeatedly demanded them, but Jiang consistently refused, driving Song to madness and eventual suicide. Our court treated this case as a general "debt dispute" and did not impose the criminal punishment that Jiang deserved. Regarding trial methods, although we pioneered "bedside mediation" and "circuit trials," our cadres' insufficient understanding of the mass line led to superficial, one-sided investigations and mobile courts in name only. As a result, many cases were either handled improperly or remained unresolved. Some judicial personnel harbored ideas of "legal supremacy" and "ruling people by law," resorting to beatings and verbal abuse during interrogations. For instance, in handling a case, only criticism and education were sufficient for poor peasant Sun Fuhai, but the trial personnel of our "circuit trial" team, merely because Sun's "attitude was poor" during a conversation, kicked and punched him, tied him up, brought him back to the court, and sentenced him to six months of imprisonment. This demonstrates the severity of our privileged thinking. Furthermore, we mechanically apply some of the old court's litigation procedures, with all the forms prescribed in the "Complete Book of Six Laws" readily available. New cadres joining the court must first spend several months learning these "procedures" and "formats." Why do these phenomena occur? I believe it is mainly because we lack a sufficient understanding of the class essence of New Democratic law and the role that courts should play under the people's democratic dictatorship. Our leading cadres not only fail to recognize the erosion of old laws but even loudly advocate that cadres study those reactionary old things. I myself scoured the old bookstores in Shenyang for "reference materials" on old laws, intentionally or unintentionally disseminating reactionary legal views. This is extremely dangerous!
    When the central government proposed launching the judicial reform movement, I awoke as from a dream. The situations revealed by the preliminary examination above are already alarming enough. We have realized that judicial reform is a great class struggle. We are determined to wage a thorough struggle against old legal views and the old judicial style. We guarantee that the people's court will be able to play its maximum role in serving the people, to welcome the arrival of our country's large-scale economic construction.

    Liang Jianjun, President of the Xi'an County People's Court, Liaodong Province

    西安县人民法院对旧法观点进行初步检查
    编辑同志：我们辽东省西安县人民法院已经开始进行司法改革的工作。我院虽然没有一个人作过旧司法工作，但旧法观点却不断地影响着我们。首先表现在我们对法律的本质认识不清，立场不明确，有超阶级、超政治的单纯法律观点。因此，在量刑时也就产生了轻刑观点和左右摇摆的现象。如一伪村长姜敦发侵吞贫农宋喜和在土地改革时分得的果实和工资，宋屡次去索取，姜始终不给，宋气愤成疯病最后自杀。对于这一案件，我院只当作一般“债务纠纷”处理，没有给姜以应得的刑事处分。关于审判方式，我们虽然创用了“炕头调解”和“巡就审判”，但由于干部对群众路线认识不够，形成了形式地单线调查和法庭搬家。因此，对许多案件不是处理不当，就是积压不理。有的司法工作人员有“唯我独尊”“以法治人”的思想，在审讯中打骂当事人。如处理某案时，本来对贫农孙福海只给予批评教育就够了，而我们“巡就审判”组的审判人员在和孙福海谈话时，仅因为孙的“态度不好”，就对孙脚踢手打，把孙捆绑带回法院，判处了六个月的徒刑。这说明我们的特权思想是何等严重。另外，我们还机械地使用一些旧法院的诉讼程序，凡“六法全书”上所规定的表格应有尽有。新来法院工作的干部，一进门就得先花几个月的时间学那些“程序”“格式”。为什么会产生这些现象呢？我想，主要是我们对新民主主义法律的阶级本质和法院在人民民主专政的政权下应起的作用了解不够。我们领导干部不惟对旧法的侵蚀认识不足，甚至还大声疾呼地让干部学习那些反动的旧东西。我就曾在沈阳市的旧书摊遍寻关于旧法的“参考资料”，有意无意地传播反动的法律观点。这是多么危险！
    当中央提出开展司法改革运动以后，我如大梦初醒。仅像上述初步检查出来的情况，已经是够惊人的了。我们已经认识到司法改革是一次伟大的阶级斗争。我们坚决和旧法观点、旧司法作风作彻底的斗争。我们当保证人民法院能够发挥为人民服务的最大作用，以迎接我们祖国大规模经济建设的到来。
    辽东省西安县人民法院院长  梁建军
