    The Central Bureau of Iron and Steel Industry instructed directly subordinate factories and mines in North China to promote the advanced experience of the Liu Changfu Group's economic accounting system, and designated it as one of the central tasks of the increase production and practice economy campaign in the second half of the year. The instruction pointed out: Since the past three years, the production of various factories and mines in North China has advanced rapidly, the level of workers' awareness has been raised unprecedentedly, and various technical and business operations have also made significant progress. However, up to now, the workshops in various factories and mines have not yet implemented an economic accounting system, and the masses of workers do not know how to do planning work. The management of raw materials is chaotic, financial management has not yet become standardized, the technical supervision system and operating procedures have not been conscientiously implemented and executed, the dedicated responsibility system has not been universally established, costs are inaccurate, quality is poor, reports are backlogged, and accidents occur continuously. These problems are centrally manifested as the management work lagging behind the requirements of production development, and the leadership's thinking and leadership methods failing to keep up with the new situation of production development. These problems must be resolved quickly in order to promote continued progress in production. This requires the implementation of an economic accounting system, so that workers understand, master, and care about various production indicators and various work systems, and that planning management has a solid mass base. The advanced experience of the Liu Changfu Group in Tianjin Steel Plant provides the direction and method for solving this problem.
    The advanced experience of the Liu Changfu Group is a relatively complete model with universal significance, which solves the following series of enterprise management problems:
    1. The group has established a set of working systems and methods for the group's economic accounting system, which are suitable for general work sections and workshops. This group has its own plans and original records. All workers can understand the production figures, quality, cost, raw material consumption and other indicators on the same day and compare them with the plan. Therefore, it makes the workers very concerned about the completion of the plan, thereby politically strengthening the workers' sense of responsibility to the country by doing a good job in production, establishing various work systems, and persisting unremittingly. The establishment of these responsibility systems provides a strong organizational guarantee for the economic accounting system.
    2. The purpose of implementing the economic accounting system is to improve output quality and reduce costs, so that management work can get on the right track. The Liu Changfu Group fully grasped and understood this purpose, and seized the central link in solving this problem, that is, starting from solving the "low operating rate," "many accidents," and "high scrap rate" existing in the group at that time, and found that the key lies in the low technical level of the workers. Therefore, Liu Changfu taught his fifteen years of steel rolling experience, and then the technicians taught the operating procedures. Subsequently, the labor organization was improved, technical improvements and rationalization proposals were vigorously carried out, and a responsibility system was established, and then learning to calculate and analyze records. In this way, it progressed gradually, from simple to complex, from blind to conscious, from low-level to high-level, and developed into a series of production reforms.
    3. The group's growth is under sound ideological leadership, which has improved the workers' class consciousness, the close combination of leaders and the masses, the combination of labor and technology, and unity from top to bottom; all the group's meetings and learning systems are centered on production, so they can truly unite and concentrate on production reform. This enables the group to maintain a high level of enthusiasm and vigor for a long time.
    4. The group's success is also due to the strong support and specific help from the leadership. In the early stage, it was carefully selected by the factory leadership and carried out effective and continuous education on the economic accounting system. Although some difficulties occurred during the implementation, the workshop director and the Party organization provided help and support, helping to overcome the conservative ideas of the workers, specifically solving the technical problems and the difficulties of workers with low cultural levels who could not record and calculate, and also appropriately criticized and corrected the complacent emotions that had occurred in the group.
    The instruction pointed out: All enterprises must vigorously promote the advanced experience of the Liu Changfu Group and designate it as one of the central tasks of the increase production and practice economy campaign in the second half of the year.
    The method of promotion: universally appeal, focus on promotion, and require each major workshop to select one or two groups for cultivation, make achievements before the end of the year, summarize them, and evaluate them. All factories and mines must make specific arrangements and make specific promotion plans.

    中央钢铁工业局指示华北直属厂矿
    推广刘长福小组经济核算制的先进经验
    中央重工业部钢铁工业局，指示华北直属厂矿推广刘长福小组经济核算制的先进经验，并把它确定为下半年增产节约竞赛运动的中心工作之一。指示指出：华北各厂矿三年以来，生产突飞猛进，工人觉悟程度空前提高，各项技术及业务工作亦有显著进步。但迄今为止，各厂矿还没实行车间经济核算制，工人群众还不会做计划工作。原材料的管理紊乱，财务管理也没步入正规，技术监督制度、操作规程也没有认真贯彻和执行，专责制度没普遍建立，成本不确，质量不良，表报积压，事故不断发生。这些问题集中表现为管理工作落后于生产发展的要求，领导思想和领导方法赶不上生产发展的新形势的要求。必须迅速解决这些问题，才能推动生产继续前进。这就要推行经济核算制，使工人了解、掌握和关心生产各种指标及各种工作制度，使计划管理有坚固的群众基础。天津钢厂刘长福小组的先进经验提供了解决这个问题的方向和方法。
    刘长福小组的先进经验，是一个比较完整的带有普遍意义的典型，它解决了以下一系列的企业管理中的问题：
    一、小组建立了一套小组经济核算制的工作制度及工作方法，这些方法和制度适合一般的工段和车间。这个小组有自己的计划和原始记录，全体工人当日能了解生产数字及质量、成本、原材料消耗等指标并把它们与计划对比。因而使工人十分关心计划的完成，从而在政治上加强了工人搞好生产，对国家负责的主人翁思想，建立了各种工作制度，并坚持不懈。这些责任制的建立，便使经济核算制有了组织上的强有力的保证。
    二、推行经济核算制的目的是为了提高产量质量、降低成本，使管理工作走上正轨。刘长福小组完全掌握和了解这个目的，并抓住了解决这个问题的中心环节，即从解决当时小组存在的“作业率低”、“事故多”、“废品率大”着手，发现了其关键在于工人技术水平低，因此刘长福即传授其十五年轧钢经验，再由技术人员讲授操作规程，随后改进劳动组织，大力开展技术改进及合理化建议，并建立责任制，再学习计算及分析记录。这样逐步前进，由简到繁，由盲目到自觉，由低级到高级，发展为一系列的生产改革。
    三、小组的成长是在健全的思想领导下，提高了工人的阶级觉悟，领导和群众密切结合，劳动和技术结合，上下一致；小组的一切会议和学习制度都以生产为中心，他们就能真正地团结一致，专心生产改革。这样就使小组能长期保持着高涨的热情，朝气勃勃。
    四、小组的成功还由于领导方面的大力支持和具体帮助。在初期是经过厂的领导方面慎重选择并进行有效的、不断的经济核算制的教育。推行中虽发生了若干困难，而车间主任及党的组织则加以帮助和支持，帮助克服工人的保守思想，具体解决了技术问题及工人文化低不能记录和计算的困难，也适当地批评和纠正了小组曾经发生过的自满情绪。
    指示指出：各企业必须大力推广刘长福小组先进经验，并把它确定为下半年增产节约竞赛运动的中心工作之一。
    推广的办法：普遍号召，重点推广，要求在每个主要车间选择一个到两个小组进行培养，在年底以前做出成绩来，加以总结，并进行评定。各厂矿必须进行具体布置，做出具体推广计划。
