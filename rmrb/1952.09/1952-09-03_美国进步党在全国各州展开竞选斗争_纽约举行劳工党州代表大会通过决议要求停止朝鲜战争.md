Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: TASS, New York, August 29th dispatch: According to Los Angeles newspapers, the American Progressive Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates, Hallinan and Mrs. Bass, and the vice-chairman of the Progressive Party's National Committee, Robertson, delivered speeches at a mass rally of over 9,000 people held at the "Carville" stadium. In his speech at the rally, Hallinan reiterated that peace and an immediate end to the Korean War are the most important issues in the 1952 election campaign. He said, "The American people will be delighted to welcome an immediate end to the slaughter."

Currently, the Progressive Party is continuing its struggle to have its candidates listed on the election ballots in various states. A "Worker's Daily" reporter reported that the Progressive Party's Oregon organization has convened a representative assembly, adding Hallinan and Mrs. Bass to the state's election list. Three thousand people participated in the assembly. Representatives from the ILWU, the Woodworkers Union, and unions for carpenters, printers, cannery workers, and fishery workers affiliated with the CIO and AFL also participated in the work of the assembly.

The Progressive Party is now entitled to nominate its own candidates in New York, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Missouri. According to Baldwin, secretary of the Progressive Party's National Committee, by October the party will be entitled to nominate its own candidates in thirty-five states, including all the large industrial states except Ohio. Baldwin declared that due to overt acts of terror and "completely unreasonable" election laws, the Progressive Party will probably be unable to have its candidates listed on the election ballots in many southern states. Baldwin continued that this does not mean, however, that the Progressive Party is not prepared to conduct a movement to defend peace in these states.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: TASS, New York: The American Labor Party (i.e., the Progressive Party's organization in New York State), which participates in the American Progressive Party, held its annual state convention in New York on August 28th. At the convention, in accordance with state election law, Hallinan and Mrs. Bass were formally nominated as the American Labor Party's candidates for U.S. President and Vice President in this year's election, and Lamont was nominated as the candidate for New York State Senator. A total of 275 representatives attended the convention.

Lamont delivered the central speech at the meeting, in which he denounced the "reactionary, anti-democratic, and war-mongering policies" of the Democratic and Republican parties. Lamont pledged that if elected, he would constantly fight to "end the bloody, futile, and irresponsible Korean War, end the insane arms race—the U.S. government bears the primary responsibility for forcing the world into an arms race, and end the destruction of the Bill of Rights and the barbaric discrimination and insults against blacks and other minorities."

Lamont said: Democrats and Republicans alike loudly proclaim how much they love the black people, but at the same time keep black people condemned as third-class citizens—victims of discrimination, segregation, murder, and atrocities...Democrats and Republicans claim they are seeking international peace, but they are competing to formulate massive arms programs, continue the war in Korea, rearm West Germany and Japan, shout insults at the Soviet Union, and reject all proposals for reconciliation made by the Soviets.

The representatives of the American Labor Party listened to and discussed the report on the New York State election plan and passed a resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Korea, and demanding that Truman take immediate action to achieve an immediate truce at the agreed-upon demarcation line.

The convention received a telegram from the American Labor Party leader Marcantonio, who could not attend in person. Marcantonio accused the Democratic and Republican parties of "competing for the title of war party."

    美国进步党在全国各州展开竞选斗争
    纽约举行劳工党州代表大会通过决议要求停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约八月二十九日讯：据洛杉矶报纸报道，美国进步党正、副总统候选人哈利南和巴斯夫人与进步党全国委员会副主席罗伯逊，在“卡维尔”运动场举行的九千余人的群众大会上发表演说。哈利南在大会上再次声称，和平及立即停止朝鲜战争，是一九五二年竞选运动中的最重要的问题。他说：“美国人民将欢欣满意地欢迎立即停止屠杀。”
    现在，进步党正在继续为使该党候选人列入各州选举名单而斗争。“工人日报”记者报道，进步党俄勒冈州组织已经召开了代表大会，把哈利南和巴斯夫人列入该州的选举名单，参加这次大会的有三千人。参加产联和劳联的国际码头工人联合会、木材工人工会以及木工、印刷工人、罐头工人、渔业工人等工会的代表都参加了代表大会的工作。
    进步党现在已经有权在纽约州、加利福尼亚州、马萨诸塞州、新泽西州、华盛顿州、俄勒冈州、爱达荷州、蒙大拿州、康涅狄格州、宾夕法尼亚州和密苏里州提出自己的候选人。据进步党全国委员会书记鲍尔温称，到十月该党将有权在三十五个州提出自己的候选人，包括除俄亥俄州以外的所有大工业的州。鲍尔温宣称，由于公开的恐怖手段及“完全不合理的”选举法，进步党大概无法在南部许多州把自己的候选人列入选举名单。鲍尔温继续说，不过，这并不是说，进步党不准备在这些州进行保卫和平的运动。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：参加美国进步党的美国劳工党（即进步党在纽约州的组织）于八月二十八日在纽约举行了一年一度的州代表大会，在会上按照州选举法，正式提名哈利南和巴斯夫人为美国劳工党参加今年大选的美国正副总统候选人，拉蒙特为纽约州参议员候选人。参加大会的代表共有二百七十五人。
    拉蒙特在会上发表了中心演说，他指责民主党和共和党的“反动的、反民主的、煽动战争的政策”。拉蒙特提出保证说，假如他当选的话，他将不断地进行斗争，来“结束血腥的、无用的、不负责任的朝鲜战争，结束疯狂的军备竞赛——美国政府要对强使世界进行军备竞赛负主要责任，结束对权利法案的破坏行为以及对黑人和其它少数种族的野蛮的歧视和侮辱”。
    拉蒙特说：民主党人和共和党人一样地大声疾呼，说他们多么爱护黑种人民，但是同时却使黑人仍然被宣判为第三等公民——歧视、隔离、谋杀、暴行的受难者。……民主党人和共和党人声言他们在设法获致国际和平，但是却竞相制订庞大的军备计划、继续在朝鲜进行战争、重新武装西德和日本、对苏联叫嚣侮辱并拒绝苏联人提出的一切和好建议。
    美国劳工党的代表听取了并讨论了纽约州选举计划的报告，并通过一项决议，要求立刻在朝鲜无条件停火，并要求杜鲁门立刻采取行动，务求在双方所协议的分界线上立即停战。
    代表大会收到了不能亲自到会的美国劳工党领袖马肯托尼奥的一封电报。马肯托尼奥指责民主党和共和党“竞相争夺战争党的称号”。
