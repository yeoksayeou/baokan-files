Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, in order to reach an understanding with the Bonn Federal Assembly on the issues of all-German participation in concluding a peace treaty with Germany and holding all-German free elections, elected a delegation composed of Mahtun, Nueshke, Haiman, Herman, and Goldenbaum on September 5th to negotiate with the West German parliament. After receiving a reply from the Speaker of the Bonn Federal Assembly, Ellers, expressing readiness to meet with the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, the delegation arrived in Bonn from Berlin by plane on the 19th and delivered a letter from the People's Chamber to the Speaker of the West German Federal Assembly on the 20th. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic put forward two proposals in the letter:
	I. The German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of West Germany should send representatives to the Four-Power Conference, the purpose of which should be to peacefully resolve all issues related to Germany.
	II. A German investigation team should be formed to investigate the conditions for holding all-German free elections, including determining the date for the investigation team to begin its activities.
	The letter pointed out: If the members of the West German Federal Assembly express their willingness to establish mutual understanding in accordance with the wishes of the entire German people, the People's Chamber delegation is authorized to hold all necessary negotiations with the fully authorized members of the Federal Assembly to implement the above proposals.
	The government of the German Democratic Republic also promised to provide the investigation team with the opportunity to conduct necessary investigations in various locations at any time, as long as the investigation team receives the same opportunity in West Germany.
	After delivering the above letter, Mahtun, Vice-Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, issued a statement emphasizing the importance of the suggestions put forward by the Soviet government in its note of August 23rd. He said, "If the German people unite and act together, it will promote the convening of the Four-Power Conference and the reaching of an agreement among the four major powers."
	After receiving the letter from the People's Chamber, Ellers, Speaker of the Bonn Federal Assembly, said that he would immediately forward the letter to the various parliamentary groups of the Federal Assembly and the Federal Government. He emphasized that he was very grateful for every step taken to eliminate or reduce any obstacles on the road to unification.
	The delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic was warmly welcomed by the West German people. The Central Committee of the West German Communist Party and the West German Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued statements welcoming the delegation to Bonn. The statement of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party said: The German people expect that the delegation will not only be received by the Federal Assembly, but that the proposals put forward by the delegation can become a matter for serious discussion between the representatives of both the Federal Assembly and the People's Chamber. This discussion must be imbued with a spirit of determination to establish mutual understanding, to stop the war, that is, to stop the disaster that threatens the German people. The West German Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued a statement saying: The West German people should work to stop the discussion on the "General Treaty" and demand that discussions on the Soviet note be started immediately.
	The delegation expressed its conviction when leaving the Bonn Republic that the proposals submitted to the Bonn Federal Assembly would receive the support of the majority of the people.
Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: According to a report from the German News Agency in Berlin: The delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic that visited the Bonn West German Federal Assembly returned to Berlin on the 21st and reported the visit to President Pieck.
	Mahtun, Vice-Chairman of the People's Chamber and a member of the delegation, stated when reporting the visit to President Pieck that the delegation was welcomed by the West German people. He pointed out: Many West German parliamentarians and well-known figures in political, economic, and cultural circles, as well as representatives of many West German people, wanted to meet with the People's Chamber delegation. The People's Chamber delegation requested the Minister of the Interior of North Rhine-Westphalia to extend the time limit for their stay in Bonn to the 23rd, but this request was rejected, so the delegation was unable to meet with many people who wanted to see them. However, despite this, People's Chamber Vice-Chairman Goldenbaum still held a meeting with representatives of many West German farmers, and other representatives of the delegation also spoke with some people, including members of the West German parliament. From these conversations, it can be seen that they sympathize with the holding of peace talks between East and West German representatives.
	Mahtun concluded by saying: The talks that have already begun in Bonn will continue until the goal of peaceful unification is achieved.

    建议就参加四国会议和组织调查团问题获致谅解
    民主德国议会代表团会晤西德议会主席
    【本报讯】综合新华社消息：德意志民主共和国人民议会，为了与波恩联邦议会就全德参加缔结对德和约问题与举行全德自由选举问题求得谅解，已于九月五日选出了一个由马吞、努舍克、海曼、荷曼和戈登堡姆组成的代表团与西德议会进行谈判。在接到波恩联邦议会主席爱勒斯复电准备接见德意志民主共和国人民议会代表团后，代表团已于十九日乘飞机由柏林抵达波恩，并于二十日以人民议会的信件一封递交西德联邦议会主席。德意志民主共和国人民议会在信里提出了两项建议：
        一、德意志民主共和国和西德联邦共和国派遣代表参加四国会议，会议的目的应该是和平解决一切有关德国的问题。
    二、组成一个德国调查团，调查举行全德自由选举的条件，包括确定调查团开始活动的日期。
    信中指出：如果西德联邦议会议员表示愿意依照全德人民的愿望建立互相谅解的话，人民议会代表团受权与全权的联邦议会议员举行一切必要的谈判，以实行上述建议。
    德意志民主共和国政府并答应愿意随时给予调查团以在各地进行必要调查的机会，只要这个调查团在西德也得到同样的机会。
    在递交上述信件之后，德意志民主共和国人民议会副主席马吞发表声明，强调指出苏联政府在八月二十三日照会中所提建议的重要性，他说“如果德国人民联合一致行动起来，就可以促进四国会议的召开和四大国间达成协议。”
    波恩联邦议会主席爱勒斯收下人民议会的信件之后说，他将立刻把这封信转交联邦议会各党团以及联邦政府。他着重指出，对于为了消除或缩小走向统一的道路上的任何障碍所采取的每一步骤，他都是非常感谢的。
    德意志民主共和国人民议会代表团受到西德人民热烈欢迎。西德共产党中央委员会及民主德国全国阵线西德委员会发表声明，欢迎代表团到波恩。德共中央委员会声明说：德国人民期望的是，代表团不仅被联邦议会接待，而且代表团所提出的建议能成为联邦议会与人民议会双方代表认真讨论的问题。这次讨论必须贯穿着决心建立互相谅解的精神，以制止战争，也就是制止威胁德国人民的灾难。民主德国全国阵线西德委员会发表声明说：西德人民应该努力制止关于“一般性条约”的讨论，要求立即着手讨论苏联的照会。
    代表团在离开波恩共和国时表示，深信交给波恩联邦议会的建议会获得大多数人民的支持。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国人民议会访问波恩西德联邦议会的代表团已于二十一日回到柏林，并向皮克总统报告了访问经过。
    代表团成员之一、人民议会副主席马吞在向皮克总统报告访问经过时表明，代表团受到了西德人民的欢迎。他指出：许多西德议员和政治、经济、文化界著名人士以及许多西德人民的代表都想要会见人民议会代表团。人民议会代表团曾请求北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的内政部长把他们在波恩逗留的时限延长到二十三日，但是这个请求遭到了拒绝，因此代表团未能会见到许多想见他们的人。但是，尽管如此，人民议会副主席戈登堡姆仍和许多西德农民的代表们进行了一次会谈，代表团的其他代表们也和一些人谈了话，其中包括西德议会的议员们。从这些谈话中间可以看出，他们是同情举行东西德代表之间的和平谈判的。
    马吞最后说：已经在波恩开始的会谈将要继续进行，直到达到和平统一的目标时为止。
