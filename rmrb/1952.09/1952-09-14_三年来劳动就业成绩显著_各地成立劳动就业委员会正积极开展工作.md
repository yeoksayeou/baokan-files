    Remarkable Achievements in Labor Employment Over the Past Three Years
    Labor Employment Committees Established in Various Regions are Actively Carrying Out Work
    [Report from this newspaper] In the past three years, the nation's labor employment work has achieved remarkable results. After the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues," various regions have further launched labor employment work.
    Long-term imperialist aggression and the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang created a serious unemployment phenomenon in Chinese society. In the past three years, governments at all levels have taken various measures to solve this serious social unemployment problem left over from the old China. The People's Government adopted a policy of "taking over everything" for all former public employees of the Kuomintang reactionary regime at the time of takeover; implemented land reform in the vast rural areas, enabling unemployed vagrants in rural areas, former military officers returning home to engage in production, and landlords who had never engaged in production to receive a share of land and engage in labor production; and actively introduced employment, career changes, or provided shelter, resettlement, and relief for a large number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people. By the end of last year, more than 2.2 million unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals had been re-employed with the help of the People's Government. In East China, more than 1.2 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people have been helped by the People's Government to find jobs, or have been sheltered, relieved, and resettled by the People's Government in the past three years. Among them, in Shanghai, from the establishment of the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee in July 1950 to December 1951, more than 113,000 of the more than 179,000 unemployed workers registered with the committee were introduced to work; for unemployed intellectuals, from the registration of unemployed intellectuals in December 1951 to July 1952, more than 4,500 people have obtained work or learning opportunities. In Central and Southern China, more than 1 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people have been introduced to employment and sent back to their hometowns to engage in production.
    At present, the four major administrative regions of Northeast, East China, Central and South China, and Southwest China, as well as 25 provinces and cities, and two administrative offices have successively established labor employment committees. Some of the labor employment committees that have been established in various regions are actively preparing for organizational personnel work, while others have initially formulated plans and are launching work based on the principle of being active and prudent. The registration work in Beijing began on the 5th of this month for pilot testing and will be completed before the end of next month. The four cities of Wuhan, Nantong, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Qingjiang in northern Jiangsu will also complete registration work in October. Shenyang has begun registration and decided to organize more than 12,000 unemployed and semi-unemployed people to participate in municipal construction work this month. More than 5,200 people are currently participating in this work.
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" has been warmly supported by the masses in various regions. This newspaper and the Shanghai Liberation Daily have recently received a large number of letters from unemployed people and people who have been helped by the government to find jobs, expressing heartfelt gratitude for the People's Government's wise measures to comprehensively solve the labor employment problem. Most people recognize the objective and favorable conditions for solving the labor employment problem now and the certain difficulties that still exist, and believe that under the leadership of the People's Government, the comprehensive labor employment problem can be gradually solved.

    三年来劳动就业成绩显著
    各地成立劳动就业委员会正积极开展工作
    【本报讯】三年来，全国劳动就业工作，已有显著成绩。中央人民政府政务院发布“关于劳动就业问题的决定”后，各地又进一步展开了劳动就业工作。
    帝国主义长期的侵略与国民党长期的反动统治，在中国社会上造成了严重的失业现象。三年来，各级人民政府采取了各种措施，来解决这个旧中国遗留下来的严重的社会失业问题。人民政府对国民党反动统治崩溃时所有旧公教人员，在接管时采取了全部包下来的政策；在广大农村实行了土地改革，使农村中的无业游民、还乡生产的旧军官以及从来不事生产的地主都分到了一份土地，得以从事劳动生产；对于大批失业和半失业人员，则积极介绍就业、转业或加以收容、安置和救济。截至去年年底，失业工人和失业知识分子，经人民政府帮助重新就业的，即已达二百二十余万人。华东区各地，三年来已有一百二十多万失业和半失业人员，经人民政府帮助获得了工作，或由人民政府加以收容、救济和安置。其中如上海市，自一九五零年七月失业工人救济委员会成立时起到一九五一年十二月止，向该会登记的失业工人十七万九千余人中，即有十一万三千余人经过介绍得到了工作；失业知识分子，从一九五一年十二月进行失业知识分子登记后，到一九五二年七月，已有四千五百余人获得工作或学习的机会。中南区介绍就业和遣送还乡生产的失业、半失业人员，也有一百多万人。
    目前，东北、华东、中南、西南四大行政区及二十五个省、市和两个行署区相继成立了劳动就业委员会。各地已成立的劳动就业委员会，有的正在积极进行机构人事的准备工作，有的业已初步拟订计划，根据积极而慎重的方针展开工作。北京市的登记工作已于本月五日开始进行典型试验，并将于下月底以前完成全部登记工作。武汉市、苏北的南通、扬州、泰州、清江四市，也将于十月份完成登记工作。沈阳市已开始进行登记，并决定在本月内组织一万二千余名失业、半失业人员参加市政建设工作。现在参加这一工作的，已有五千二百余人。
    中央人民政府政务院“关于劳动就业问题的决定”，受到了各地群众的热烈拥护。本报和上海解放日报等近来收到大批失业的和已由政府帮助得到工作的人员的来信，对人民政府全面解决劳动就业问题的贤明措施表示由衷的感谢。大部分人都认识到现在解决劳动就业问题的客观有利条件和目前尚存在的一定困难，相信在人民政府领导下，全面劳动就业问题一定可以逐步解决。
