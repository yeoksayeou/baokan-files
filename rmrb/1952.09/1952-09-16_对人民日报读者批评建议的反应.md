Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

Editor's Note: We are now publishing below a summary of the responses from relevant parties to the criticisms and suggestions from People's Daily readers.

    ▲ A letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the East China United Transportation Company, accepting the criticism from the Zhuji County Unemployed Workers Relief Committee regarding the Zhuji work group of the company requiring "shop guarantees" when recruiting staff (the original criticism was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on July 16th). When the company recruited staff in 1950, there were regulations for providing a "guarantee," but it was not limited to a "shop guarantee." However, this time, the business section chief of the company informed the work group comrades to ask the recruited staff for a "shop guarantee," which led to this error. The company has now corrected this error and is determined to strengthen its reliance on the working class in future work.

    ▲ A letter from the Civil Affairs Section of the Zuoquan County People's Government, accepting the reader Jia Bingzhi's opinion on correcting the erroneous practice of having elementary school students deliver letters in some villages (the original opinion was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on August 9th). They have explained to the cadres of Cheshangpu Village the reasons why sending students to deliver letters would affect their studies and educated them to correct this inappropriate practice; they have also notified all districts and villages to conduct inspections on this issue.

    ▲ A letter from the Northeast Regional Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company, accepting the criticism from readers Ding Dake and Li Changqing (the original criticism was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on August 13th). The letter states: It is true that some of the company's goods were not securely packaged during transportation, resulting in losses to state property. Upon inspection, these goods were packaged by the production units, but the company did not conduct careful inspections when taking delivery. The company has conducted a review of this irresponsible attitude and has forwarded the readers' opinions to the factories and mines under the industrial departments, requesting them to pay attention to the packaging of goods in the future.

    ▲ After the "Readers' Letters" page on August 13th published a summary of readers' letters entitled "Suggestions for the Post Office to Improve the Distribution of 'Study Culture' Magazine," the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government attached great importance to this issue. The bureau wrote: "Our bureau has instructed the provincial postal and telecommunications administrations to conduct inspections on the issues of delays, omissions, misdeliveries, and refusal to subscribe in the distribution of 'Study Culture' magazine. Detailed information will be provided to you after the reports from the provincial postal and telecommunications administrations are received."

    ▲ A letter from the Wuhu City Patriotic Health Committee in response to reader Zhu Dajun's opinion (the original opinion was published on the "Readers' Letters" page on August 13th). The letter states: The patriotic health campaign in Wuhu City was launched in early April. However, due to insufficient publicity and education work in the initial stage, health work had not yet become a mass movement. Starting in late July, the leadership of the patriotic health campaign was strengthened. Leading cadres took the lead and vigorously mobilized the masses, and under the principle of combining publicity with action and action with inspection, a city-wide upsurge of the patriotic health campaign was launched. In mid-August, this campaign basically concluded, and a new scene has emerged throughout the city. In the future, we will prevent and overcome the phenomenon of "doing things in a flurry" and complacency, and on the basis of existing achievements, conduct patriotic health work more extensively, deeply, and persistently in order to win greater victories.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    编者按：今将各有关方面对人民日报读者批评建议的反应摘要发表于后。
    ▲华东联运公司浙江省公司来信，接受诸暨县失业工人救济委员会对该公司诸暨工作组提出的招收工作人员时不该要“铺保”的批评（原批评刊七月十六日“读者来信专页”）。该公司在一九五○年招考工作人员时，曾有“具保”的规定，但并未限制为
    “铺保”。这次该公司业务股长却告知工作组同志，向所招的工作人员要“铺保”，以致发生了这个错误。现该公司已纠正这个错误，并决心在今后工作中加强依靠工人阶级的思想。
    ▲左权县人民政府民政科来信，接受读者贾炳智关于纠正某些村庄让小学生送信的错误做法的意见
    （原意见刊八月九日“读者来信专页”）。他们已向车上铺村干部说明了派学生送信会影响学生学习的道理，教育他们纠正这种不妥当的做法；并通知各区、村也对这个问题进行检查。
    ▲中国工业器材公司东北区公司来信，接受读者丁大可、李长卿的批评（原批评刊八月十三日“读者来信专页”）。来信说：该公司某些货物在运输时包装不牢固，致使国家财产遭受损失，确是事实。经检查，这些货物是由生产单位包装的，但该公司提货时没有认真检查。该公司对这种不负责任的态度已进行了检讨，并把读者意见转告工业部门所属厂矿，要求他们今后注意货物的包装问题。
    ▲八月十三日“读者来信专页”发表了以“建议邮局改进‘学文化’杂志的发行工作”为题的读者来信综述后，中央人民政府邮电部邮政总局对这个问题很重视。该局来信说：“我局已指示各省邮电管理局对‘学文化’杂志发行工作中所存在的迟缓、漏寄、错寄及拒订等问题进行检查。详细情况待各省邮电管理局报告来后再告诉你们。”
    ▲芜湖市爱国卫生委员会来信答复读者朱大钧的意见（原意见刊八月十三日“读者来信专页”）。来信说：芜湖市的爱国卫生运动在四月初就开展了。但初期因宣传教育工作做得不够，卫生工作还没有成为群众性的运动。七月下旬起，爱国卫生运动的领导加强了。领导干部亲自动手，大力发动群众，并在宣传与行动、行动与检查相结合的方针下，掀起了全市性的爱国卫生运动的高潮。八月中旬，这一运动基本结束，全市已出现一片新景象。今后，我们将防止和克服“轰一阵”现象和自满情绪，在已有成绩的基础上，更广泛、深入、持久地进行爱国卫生工作，以争取更大的胜利。
