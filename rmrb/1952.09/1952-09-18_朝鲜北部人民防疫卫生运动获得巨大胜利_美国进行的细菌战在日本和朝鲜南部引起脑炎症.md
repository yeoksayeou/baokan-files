    The people's anti-epidemic and health campaign in northern Korea has achieved great victory.
    Bacterial warfare waged by the United States has caused encephalitis in Japan and southern Korea.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th] With the active support of the people, the epidemic prevention committees in Gangwon Province, Hwanghae Province, South Pyongan Province, North Pyongan Province, South Hamgyong Province, North Hamgyong Province, and Jagang Province have resolutely implemented the orders of the Korean Military Committee and the instructions of the National Emergency Epidemic Prevention Committee during the summer anti-bacterial warfare epidemic prevention and health campaign. They have systematically led the people of all regions to thoroughly carry out work such as injections, cleaning, and disinfection, shattering the evil conspiracy of the American aggressors to wage bacterial warfare.
    At the same time, all regions have vigorously carried out publicity and education on epidemic prevention and hygiene and prevention of diseases and insect pests in crops, achieving great results.
    During the summer epidemic prevention and health campaign, the Korean National Emergency Epidemic Prevention Committee called on epidemic prevention committees in various regions to launch competitions. As a result, the epidemic prevention committee of Pyonggang County, Gangwon Province, which is close to the front line, achieved the best results and won the "Victory Flag" awarded by the National Emergency Epidemic Prevention Committee.
    The people of northern Korea are launching an autumn epidemic prevention and health campaign based on the victory of the summer epidemic prevention and health campaign.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th] Thanks to the timely and effective anti-bacterial warfare epidemic prevention and health campaign launched by the people of Korea and China, the American aggressors' evil attempt to use bacterial warfare to massively slaughter the people of Korea and China has been foiled. However, the bacterial warfare waged by the United States has caused evil consequences in Japan and the areas of southern Korea ruled by the American-Li bandit gangs.
    As early as January of this year, just when the American invading army began to use bacteriological weapons, the Li Seung-man bandit gang spared no effort to cover up the crimes of the American invading army in waging bacteriological warfare. On the other hand, they were also very worried that bacteriological warfare would make them suffer. The "Kyonghyang Shinmun," the mouthpiece of the Li Seung-man bandit gang published in Seoul, published a message on the second page on January 8, anxiously stating that there were 90 million rats in various parts of South Korea, "which are likely to become the medium of plague."
    In July and August this year, encephalitis began to spread in Japan and South Korea. According to a Tokyo broadcast on September 2, encephalitis is continuing to spread fiercely throughout Japan. There are no signs of decrease as it enters September. In Tokyo alone, 45 people developed encephalitis in one day, from the morning of September 1 to the morning of September 2. As a result, 413 people in Tokyo have suffered from encephalitis this year, of whom 80 have died. This number is equal to six times last year's. According to a Busan dispatch from the South Korean 合同 [presumably meaning United] News Agency on the 10th, the "Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters" of the Li Seung-man puppet government announced on the 10th that as of September 9, 380 people in South Korea had suffered from encephalitis, of whom 95 had died. In the 24 hours from the 8th to the 9th, 53 people developed encephalitis and 17 died.

    朝鲜北部人民防疫卫生运动获得巨大胜利
    美国进行的细菌战在日本和朝鲜南部引起脑炎症
    【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜北部各地人民，在反细菌战的夏季防疫卫生运动中，已经取得了巨大的胜利。在运动中，江原道、黄海道、平安南道、平安北道、咸镜南道、咸镜北道和慈江道各地的防疫委员会，在人民的积极支持下，坚决执行朝鲜军事委员会的命令和国家非常防疫委员会的指示，有计划有步骤地领导各地人民彻底进行了注射、清扫、消毒等工作，粉碎了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪恶阴谋。
    与此同时，各地并大力进行了防疫卫生和农作物防止病虫害的宣传教育工作，获得很大的成绩。
    在夏季防疫卫生运动中，朝鲜国家非常防疫委员会曾号召各地防疫委员会展开竞赛，竞赛结果，以临近前线的江原道平康郡防疫委员会的成绩最好，因而获得了国家非常防疫委员会颁发的“胜利之旗”。
    朝鲜北部各地人民正在夏季防疫卫生运动的胜利基础上，展开着秋季防疫卫生运动。
    【新华社平壤十五日电】由于朝中人民及时展开了有效的反细菌战防疫卫生运动，美国侵略者妄想用细菌战来大规模屠杀朝中人民的罪恶企图遭到了失败。但是，美国进行的细菌战已在日本和朝鲜南部美李匪帮统治地区造成恶果。
    早在今年一月间，正当美国侵略军开始使用细菌武器的时候，李承晚匪帮一方面用尽心机掩盖美国侵略军进行细菌战的罪行，另一方面也十分担心细菌战会使他们自己遭殃。汉城出版的李承晚匪帮的喉舌“京乡新闻”一月八日在第二版上发表了一段消息，提心吊胆地说南朝鲜各地统计有九千万只老鼠，“很可能成为鼠疫的媒介”。
    今年七、八月间，脑炎症开始在日本各地和南朝鲜蔓延。据东京九月二日广播：脑炎症正在日本全国各地继续猛烈地蔓延着。进入九月，仍无减少迹象。只东京市一地，在九月一日晨到九月二日晨的一天中，就有四十五人发生脑炎。因而东京市在今年中患脑炎者已有四百一十三人，其中已有八十人死亡。这个数字等于去年的六倍。又据南朝鲜的合同通讯社釜山十日电透露：李承晚傀儡政府的“中央防疫本部”十日宣布：截至九月九日，南朝鲜患脑炎者已达三百八十人，其中已有九十五人死亡。在八日到九日的二十四小时内，就有五十三人发生脑炎，死十七人。
