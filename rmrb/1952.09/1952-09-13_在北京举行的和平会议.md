    Peace Conference Held in Beijing
    General Heriberto Jara, Mexico, Stalin International Peace Prize Laureate
    The upcoming peace conference in Beijing is of great significance. Representatives carefully selected by the people of Asian and Pacific countries participating in the conference will discuss matters surrounding the central issue that concerns all honest people, those who are unwilling to achieve any intention at the cost of annihilating their fellow human beings and destroying the finest representatives of culture.

    Because the desire for peace is sincere and universal, the conference will certainly study issues worthy of concern, studying how to strengthen peace and promote economic and cultural exchanges, which are necessary for the fuller development of all nations and for further understanding between peace-loving people from countries on both sides of the same ocean.

    In the conference hall, we will hear the voices of the legitimate representatives of those peoples who have not yet been able to break free from the shackles of the colonial system, a system that has only changed in form, resulting in it becoming even more cruel. We will hear the voices of countries such as Australia, New Guinea, Borneo, Indochina, and the Philippines.

    Japanese representatives will talk about the "peace treaty" imposed on the Japanese people by the United States. From the Japanese representatives, the world will be able to understand more clearly whether the Japanese people enjoy independence, freedom, and self-determination; understand whether the renewed military occupation by the United States is true, and if so, whether it conforms to the freely expressed will of the Japanese people; understand whether the Japanese people are paying huge sums to support the occupying forces, suffering enormous economic sacrifices, and ultimately falling into a state of utter poverty.

    From the Japanese representatives, we will know the truth about the Japanese courts, which are unable to convict American criminals, even if Americans commit serious crimes against Japanese people, they are handed over to American courts, and the result is always acquittal, or at most a light sentence equivalent to detention.

    Korean representatives will talk about the ultramodern hell that Dante never imagined, where the Korean people are waging a heroic struggle against the aggressors. We will learn in detail how schools, hospitals, and entire cities behind the battle lines have been razed to the ground, how civilians have suffered massacres, and what "civilizing" effects have been achieved by napalm bombs and "humanitarian" bacteriological warfare.

    Representatives from the Asian and Pacific regions, including the people of the Americas, will have the opportunity to joyfully gather with the great Chinese people every day—a nation composed of philosophers, artists, craftsmen, and indomitable figures, who, whether in war or in peace, have achieved victory in an epic struggle without arrogance or pride.

    Their thirty years of almost uninterrupted national struggle to defend their precious interests illustrate and confirm their greatness.

    They are industrious people who have become models of respect for others, politeness, and amiability; they have left traces of their efficient and persistent work in the foreign countries they have visited—work that has become the solid foundation of enormous wealth, but in the past, before their liberation, plunderers only gave them meager wages, sometimes even discrimination and persecution.

    The admirable handicrafts of Chinese artists, such as ivory, ebony, lacquerware, porcelain, silk, etc., are proudly displayed in the magnificent palaces and museums of various countries, and even in the mansions belonging to the gold-dollar magnates and their imitators around the world.

    These are the people who have nothing to thank the West for, except for suffering poverty and the corruption of some of their simple customs. They have made great contributions to the world in philosophical thought, poetry, law, art, and handicrafts, but they have received nothing but misunderstanding and ridicule.

    They are admired by all free people who do not harbor racial prejudice; they are admirable in their ability to break free from the shackles of the corrupt Chiang Kai-shek and his clique, despite all kinds of conspiracies to prevent their full development—from internal treachery to external schemes; despite the fact that the legitimate government, dearly loved by the people, is not recognized, despite the fact that the doors of the United Nations are unjustly and absurdly closed to them, so that people cannot hear their voices; while Chiang Kai-shek's representatives occupy seats there, and Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan, continues to receive millions of US dollars, which are economic sacrifices of the American people, but in the eyes of imperialism, are a deposit to obtain cheap collateral for the economic and political freedom of the Chinese people; despite all this, we can say that the Chinese people and their People's Republic have emerged vigorously from the chaos into which they were dragged for thousands of years by internal and external enemies.

    They have arrived, they are calm, determined, their victorious new life is full of reality, full of confident hope, and they know that these will bring them a bright future.

    They are not sitting and sighing, caressing their wounds, the suffering of yesterday—yesterday, which lasted many centuries—the provocations they encounter today, and the provocations that may increase and become more vicious tomorrow, have not discouraged them; their hearts are not disturbed by doubts about the future. Nothing can diminish, let alone constrain, their creativity and organizational abilities.

    Because they are outstanding philosophers, they have confidence and hope; but their hope is not an attitude of waiting, but full activity and careful observation. Because they are mature artists, they handle all the delicate details of their handmade works with exceptional care.

    Therefore, they are able to allocate everything to realize a constructive and creative plan that is well-coordinated, a plan based on new and rational laws. For example, the trade union law treats workers as human beings, giving them the status they deserve as producers of wealth; the land reform law hands the land over to those who till it, thereby liberating millions of people who have suffered under feudal slavery; the marriage law will enable women to enjoy the same rights as men, liberating them from the humiliating position of submission they have endured for thousands of years.

    The last-mentioned progressive law will never lead to the disintegration of the family; on the contrary, it is a guarantee of the family, guaranteeing that the mother—the most important part of the family—is not humiliated, that she is freed from the situation of being trampled upon that she has endured for thousands of years, raising her status so that she can enjoy the human dignity that she deserves as someone who plays a leading role in the common work of creating and nurturing humanity.

    The rights given to married women by law are not deprived because she has no children.

    Their laws are formulated rationally and are implemented immediately. Legislation is a means to an end, in other words, the end is to solve the needs of the people based on a great vision of the future; it has no perfunctory aspects, it encompasses the entire picture of people's lives.

    All important aspects have been considered: such as health, education, art, ensuring that science can have the highest development; industry, agriculture, sports, drama, etc. Everything is coordinated according to a general plan that is carefully calculated.

    Their leaders, led by the highly respected statesman Mao Zedong, know that if agriculture does not receive broad and scientific development with "land to the tiller" as its basic driving force, then China's industry, especially large-scale industry, cannot develop, so they immediately implemented land reform.

    This task demonstrated courage, because the new leaders of the People's Republic also had to fight against various traditional bad habits and prejudices, and they have made outstanding achievements in this regard.

    The representatives attending this historic conference will inevitably appreciate all of the above. There will certainly be important proposals and valuable opinions expressed in various languages at the meeting; but all of these will converge on one apex, on which the two words "Peace" shine brilliantly, and all generous hearts that yearn for peace, the millions of such hearts, will give the two words "Peace" an incomparable brilliance.

### 在北京举行的和平会议

    在北京举行的和平会议
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获得者、墨西哥  艾里伯托·哈拉将军
    不久就要在北京举行的和平会议是有重大意义的。参加会议的亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民所慎重选派的代表们，将讨论环绕着那引起一切诚实人注意的中心问题的事项，这种人是不愿意用歼灭同类和毁灭最高贵的文化的代表者来作为达到任何意图的代价的。
    由于对和平的愿望是真诚的、普遍的，在这次会议上，大家一定会研究值得关怀的题目，研究如何加强和平和促进经济与文化交流，这对各民族的更充分的发展，对于同一海洋所洗刷的两岸上的各国爱好和平的人民相互间进一步的谅解，是必需的。
    在会场上我们会听到那些还没有能够挣脱殖民地制度束缚的人民的合法代表的声音，这种制度只是在形式上的改变，结果是使它更加残酷。我们会听到澳大利亚、新几内亚、婆罗洲、印度支那、菲律宾等等国家的声音。
    日本代表会谈到美国所强加于日本人民身上的“和约”，从日本代表那里，全世界更能明白日本人民是否享有独立、自由和自决权；明白美国的再次军事占领是否属实，而如果属实，是否符合日本人民自由表达出来的意志；明白日本人民是否付出庞大的款项来供给占领军，使自身蒙受莫大的经济牺牲，以致终将陷进赤贫的绝境。
    从日本代表那里，我们会知道日本法庭的真相，这种法庭是不能把美国的罪犯判罪的，即使是美国人对日本人犯了严重的罪，也要交给美国法庭，而结果总是宣判无罪，或者至多给予相当于拘捕的轻刑。
    朝鲜代表会谈到但丁所绝没有想像到的超现代的地狱，在那里，朝鲜人民正在对侵略者进行着英勇的斗争。我们会详细地知道那些在战场后方的学校、医院和整个城市如何被夷为平地，平民如何遭受大规模的屠杀，以及凝固汽油弹和“人道主义”的细菌战起了何种的“开化”作用。
    包括美洲各国人民在内的亚洲及太平洋区域代表们，会有机会和伟大的中国人民竟日欢聚——这个由哲学家、艺术家、工艺家和不屈不挠的人物所构成的民族，无论在战争中或是在和平时期，都已不骄不傲地在史诗式的斗争中取得了胜利。
    三十年来他们为保卫他们宝贵的利益而进行着几乎是毫无间断的民族的斗争，这说明和证实了他们的伟大。
    他们是勤劳的人民，他们在尊重别人、彬彬有礼、和蔼可亲方面，已成为模范；他们在所到的外国，都留下了他们有效率的和坚持不懈的工作的痕迹——这些工作已成为巨量财富的坚固基础，可是过去在他们没有解放前，掠夺者只给予他们少得可怜的工资，有时给的竟是歧视，甚至于是迫害。
    令人赞叹的象牙、黑檀、漆器、瓷器、丝等等中国艺术家的手制品，夸耀地陈列在各国的堂皇的宫院里、博物馆里，以至在那些属于金圆大亨和他们全世界的模仿者的大厦里。
    他们就是这样的人民，除了遭受贫困和一部分淳朴风气被腐化之外，没有别的可以感谢西方。他们在哲学思想上，在诗歌上，在法制上，在艺术以及手工艺上，对全世界都有很大的贡献，但是他们没有得到别的，只是误解和嘲笑。
    他们是一切不怀种族成见的自由人民所敬慕的对象；他们令人惊羡，他们竟然能够摆脱腐败的蒋介石及其集团的束缚，虽然有种种阻止他们充分发展的阴谋——从内部的奸谋到外部的诡计；尽管人民衷心爱戴的合法政府得不到承认，尽管联合国的大门不公正地、荒谬地对他们关闭，以致人们听不到他们的声音；同时，蒋介石的代表反而在那里占有席位，逃亡台湾的蒋介石继续领取千百万的美圆，这些美圆是美国人民经济上的牺牲，而在帝国主义看来，却是一笔定金来取得中国人民经济和政治自由的便宜的抵押品；尽管有这一切，但是，我们可以说，中国人民和他们的人民共和国，是从千百年来被内外敌人拖进的混乱状态中，活力充沛地走出来了。
    他们来到了，他们镇定、坚决，他们胜利的新生命充满着现实，充满着有把握的希望，他们知道这些会给他们带上光明的前途。
    他们并没有坐着唉声叹气地抚摩他们的创伤，昨天——许多世纪长的昨天——的苦难，今天所碰到的挑衅，还有明天可能更加增多、更加凶恶的挑衅，都没有使他们气馁；他们的心灵不受对未来的疑惑的扰乱。任何事情都不能减低、更不能约束他们的创造力和组织能力。
    因为他们是卓越的哲学家，他们有信心，有希望；但是他们的希望并不是一种等待的态度，而是充分的活动和细心的观察。因为他们是成熟的艺术家，他们异常慎重地处理他们手制的作品的一切细致的地方。
    因此他们能够调配一切来实现一个富于建设性和创造性的、配合得恰当的计划，这个计划是建立在新的、合情合理的法律的基础上面。例如工会法把工人当人看待，使他们得到财富生产者所应有的地位；土地改革的法律把土地交到耕种的人的手里，从而解放了千百万在封建奴役制度下遭受苦难的人民；婚姻法将使妇女享受和男子同样的权利，把他
    们从千百年来耻辱的屈服地位中解放出来。
    上面最后所举的一种进步法律，决不会导致家庭的解体；相反地，它是家庭的保证，保证母亲——家庭最主要的部分——不受屈辱，使她脱出千百年来忍受过的被蹂躏的境遇，提高她的地位，使她可享受在创造和培植人类的共同工作中起着首要作用的人所应有的人类的尊严。
    法律赋予结婚的妇女的权利，并不因为她没有子女而被剥夺。
    他们的法律制订得合情合理，而且是立刻施行。立法是达到目的的手段，换言之，目的是根据对未来的伟大预见来解决人民的需要；它没有任何敷衍应付的地方，它包括了人民生活的全貌。
    一切重要方面都考虑到了：例如卫生、教育、艺术、使科学能有最高的发展的保障；工业、农业、体育、戏剧等等。一切都遵照总的计划，作精打细算的配合。
    他们的领袖们，以德高望重的政治家毛泽东为首，都知道如果农业得不到以“耕者有其田”作为基本动力的广泛的、科学的发展，那么，中国的工业，特别是大工业，便不可能发展，因此他们就立刻实行了土地改革。
    这个任务表现了勇气，因为人民共和国的新领导者还要对各种传统的恶习和成见进行斗争，他们在这方面的努力，有卓越的功绩。
    出席这个历史性会议的代表们必然会体会到上述的一切。会上一定会有各项重要的提议，和用各种不同的语言所表达的宝贵意见；但是，种种一切都会统一在一个顶点上，那上面现出光辉灿烂的“和平”两个字，一切热望和平的豁达大度的心灵，那数达千百万的这样的心灵，将给“和平”这两个字
    以无与比拟的光辉。
