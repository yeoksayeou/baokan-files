    Welcoming National Day, Continue to Strengthen the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and Defending Peace
    The people of the whole country are joyously welcoming the Third National Day and the large-scale economic and cultural construction that is about to begin. In the three years since the founding of New China, we have achieved great victories in domestic affairs such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Our economic recovery and transformation work has been basically completed. The situation of fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation has arrived ahead of schedule. Starting this year, our country has used most of its expenditures on construction. Abroad, the just struggle of our people to resist America and aid Korea has also achieved great victories, thus ensuring the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, consolidating the security of our border, and strengthening the confidence of the people of all countries in defending peace. We have formed an incomparably strong alliance of friendship with the Soviet Union. Our friendship with the people's democratic countries and the vast peace-loving people of the world has also been unprecedentedly enhanced. All these are favorable conditions for us to carry out large-scale construction work in the future.
    However, we cannot be satisfied with this. We must continue to strengthen the struggle to win the thorough victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and to strive for lasting world peace. Because international peace is an important prerequisite for our domestic construction. Without this condition, it is impossible for us to carry out construction with peace of mind.
    We know that American imperialism will never allow us to carry out peaceful construction quietly. It enslaved us for decades. After being driven out of mainland China by us, it also forcibly occupied our Taiwan and launched a war of aggression against Korea, dreaming of attacking our country again. Until now, it is still unwilling to stop the Korean War. The Korean armistice negotiations have not reached a final agreement after more than fourteen months because of the delays and sabotage of the American aggressors. The U.S. negotiating representatives have repeatedly absented themselves from the meetings. Recently, the U.S. side has taken new provocative actions, attempting to unilaterally send 11,000 of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee gang as cannon fodder. American planes are still wantonly bombing the peaceful people of Korea on a large scale. The criminal acts of the American aggressors in carrying out bacteriological warfare against the people of China and Korea have not stopped. American planes have continued to intrude into our country's airspace. Incomplete statistics for only two months, from July 11 to September 11, show that there have been as many as 445 batches and 2,251 sorties. American warmongers are also constantly clamoring to expand the Korean War.
    At the same time, American imperialism is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism as its main tool for expanding aggression in the East. It has established as many as 612 military bases and military facilities on Japanese territory. After the signing of the San Francisco unilateral "peace treaty" with Japan and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," the United States openly stepped up the reconstruction of Japan's army, navy, and air force, and has sent Japanese troops to fight in Korea. Most of the Japanese war criminals have been illegally released. Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Aoi and others were recently brought out by the United States to participate in the Japanese election as party leaders. Bacteriological warfare criminal Shiro Ishii and others went to Korea to participate in the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare. More than 200,000 Japanese militarists who had been purged have been illegally un-purged. Japan's munitions industry is recovering and expanding, and has manufactured a large number of munitions for the U.S. military invading Korea. Recently, American imperialism also vainly attempted to drag Japan into the United Nations and intends to put together a Pacific aggressive bloc with Japan as its center, frantically preparing for a new war.
    In addition, American imperialism has also adopted various open and covert despicable methods to sabotage us. For example, American imperialism uses "blockade" and "embargo" methods to obstruct our country's peaceful trade with other countries, attempting to monopolize and plunder the economies of the people of various countries and hinder our country's economic construction. At the United Nations and various international conferences, American imperialism always creates trouble for us and is always hostile to our country. Moreover, American imperialism is constantly sending special agents and spies to our country to sabotage us from within.
    This is why we must continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea and develop the movement to defend peace.
    How to continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea? The "Current Commentary" in today's issue puts forward five important tasks: 1. Constantly pay attention to the propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea; 2. Strive to carry out the patriotic production increase and economy movement; 3. Seriously do a good job in preferential treatment work; 4. Continue to carry out the patriotic health movement; 5. Continue to strengthen and improve the patriotic convention system and the "Patriotic Day" system. Thanks to the efforts of the people of the whole country, we have achieved great results in these tasks in the past. More than 80% of the people of the whole country have received patriotic education; more than half have signed patriotic conventions. In the patriotic production increase and economy movement, the value of increased production and economy of state-owned enterprise employees in the Northeast Region alone last year was equivalent to 16 million tons of grain. This year, the planned production increase and savings in the Northeast and North China regions alone reached more than 145 trillion yuan, which is more than one and a half times the total amount donated by the people of the whole country in the aircraft and artillery donation movement last year. This has played a huge role in supporting the Volunteer Army and promoting the construction of the motherland. In the future, we should continue to work hard on the basis of past victories to do these tasks even better.
    Recently, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be held in Beijing. Representatives of 1.6 billion peace-loving people from more than 30 countries will discuss together effective ways to defend peace. This winter, the World People's Peace Congress will also be held in Vienna, the capital of Austria. People from many countries are actively preparing to participate in this congress. The people of our country are enthusiastic supporters and supporters of these two conferences. We should further care about and discuss the major issues raised by these two conferences, and actively implement the resolutions of the conferences, respond to the calls of the conferences, and unite with all peace-loving people in the world to defend peace.
    Past facts have proved that the Chinese people have the power to simultaneously achieve brilliant victories on the two fronts of building the motherland and resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending peace. These two aspects of the struggle must be carried out simultaneously. In the past, because we won victory in the struggle against American imperialist aggression and in defending peace, we were able to ensure that we could safely complete the economic recovery and transformation work in the country; moreover, because of the encouragement of the great victory on the Korean front and the popularization and deepening of patriotic education, resisting America and aiding Korea became the driving force for promoting all work and accelerating the construction of the country. Conversely, precisely because we have achieved great achievements in construction work, our national strength has increased unprecedentedly, our national defense has been consolidated, and the Volunteer Army has become stronger and stronger. From October 25, 1950 to the end of August this year, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies annihilated 600,000 enemy troops, including 260,000 American invading troops. The enemy troops were driven back to the vicinity of the "38th Parallel" by us. Our army has established a copper wall and iron wall-like position. In the future, following the advancement of national construction work, our support work for the Volunteer Army will become more and more powerful, the victory on the Korean battlefield will be more consolidated, and we will be able to win the victory of the Korean anti-aggression war and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and completely crush the American imperialist plan to expand the war. In this way, we will be able to better carry out large-scale economic and cultural construction.

### 迎接国庆，继续加强抗美援朝保卫和平的工作

专栏：宣传员讲话

    迎接国庆，继续加强抗美援朝保卫和平的工作
    全国人民正在欢天喜地迎接第三届国庆节，迎接即将来到的大规模经济建设和文化建设。新中国成立三年来，在国内，我们取得了土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”等运动的伟大胜利。我们的经济恢复改造工作基本上完成了。国家财政经济情况根本好转的局面已经提前到来。今年度起我们国家已经把大部分开支用在建设事业上。在国外，我国人民所进行的抗美援朝的正义斗争也获得了巨大的胜利，因而保障了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，巩固我国边境的安全，并加强了各国人民保卫和平的信心。我们和苏联结成了强固无比的友好同盟。我们和各人民民主国家以及全世界广大爱好和平的人民的友谊也空前增进。所有这些，都是我们今后进行大规模建设工作的有利条件。
    但是，我们还不能满足于此，我们还要继续加强斗争，来争取抗美援朝的澈底胜利和争取世界的持久和平。因为国际和平是我们进行国内建设的一个重要前提。如果没有这个条件，我们要想安心进行建设是不可能的。
    我们知道，美帝国主义决不会让我们安静地进行和平建设的。它奴役过我们几十年。它被我们赶出中国大陆以后，还强占了我国的台湾，又发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，梦想再度攻入我国。直到现在，它还不肯停止朝鲜战争。朝鲜停战谈判因为美国侵略者的拖延破坏，到现在十四个多月了还没有达成最后的协议。美方谈判代表连续逃会。最近美方又采取了新的挑衅行动，企图片面地把一万一千名我方被俘人员送给李承晚匪帮当炮灰。美国飞机还在大规模地对朝鲜的和平人民滥施轰炸。美国侵略者对中朝两国人民进行细菌战的罪恶行为也没有停止。美国飞机不断地侵入我国领空，仅七月十一日到九月十一日两个月中的不完全统计，就有四百四十五批、二千二百五十一架次之多。美国的战争贩子们还时常叫嚷着扩大朝鲜战争。
    同时，美帝国主义正在加紧复活日本的军国主义，作为它在东方扩大侵略的主要工具。它在日本领土上设立的军事基地和军事设施达六百十二处之多。旧金山片面对日“和约”和“美日安全”条约等签订之后，美国公开地加紧重建日本的陆、海、空军，并已派日本军队到朝鲜作战。日本战犯绝大部分被非法释放。甲级战犯重光葵等最近竟被美国抬出来以党魁资格参加日本的大选。细菌战犯石井四郎等则到朝鲜参加了美军的细菌战。被整肃的日本军国主义分子已有二十几万人被非法解除整肃。日本的军火工业正在恢复和扩大，而且已经给侵朝美军制造了大量军火。最近，美帝国主义并妄想把日本拉进联合国，又打算以日本为中心拼凑一个太平洋侵略集团，疯狂地准备新的战争。
    另外，美帝国主义还采取了种种公开的和隐蔽的卑鄙办法来对我们进行破坏。例如，美帝国主义用
    “封锁”“禁运”等办法，阻挠我国和其他国家的和平贸易，企图垄断、掠夺各国人民的经济并妨碍我国经济建设。在联合国和各种国际性的会议上，美帝国主义也总是经常和我们捣乱，处处与我国为敌。而且美帝国主义还不断向我国派遣特务间谍分子，从内部来破坏我们。
    这就是我们为什么必须继续加强抗美援朝的工作，并发展保卫和平的运动的道理。
    怎样继续加强抗美援朝的工作呢？今天本刊的“时评”里提出了五项重要的工作：一、经常地注意抗美援朝的宣传教育工作；二、努力开展爱国增产节约运动；三、认真做好优抚工作；四、继续开展爱国卫生运动；五、继续加强和改进爱国公约制度和“爱国日”制度。由于全国人民的努力，过去我们在这几项工作中都取得了很大的成绩。全国人民有百分之八十以上受到了爱国主义教育；有一半以上订立了爱国公约。在爱国增产节约运动中，去年仅东北区国营企业职工增产节约的价值就折合粮食一千六百万吨。今年仅东北、华北两区所订的增产节约计划，就达十四万五千亿元以上，比去年全国人民在捐献飞机大炮运动中的捐献总数还多一倍半。这对支援志愿军和推进祖国建设起了极大的作用。今后我们应该在过去胜利的基础上继续努力，把这几项工作做得更好。
    最近，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将在北京举行。三十多个国家十六亿和平人民的代表将在一起商讨保卫和平的有效方法。今年冬天，世界人民和平大会也将在奥地利首都维也纳召开，许多国家的人民已在积极筹备参加这个大会。我国人民是这两个大会的热烈支持者和拥护者。我们应该进一步关心和讨论这两个大会所提出的重大问题，并且积极执行大会的决议，响应大会的号召，和全世界一切爱好和平的人们团结起来保卫和平。
    过去的事实证明，中国人民有力量在建设祖国和抗美援朝、保卫和平这两条战线上同时取得辉煌的胜利。这两方面的斗争是必须同时进行的。过去，因为我们在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平的斗争中获得了胜利，所以就保障了我们能够在国内平安地完成经济的恢复和改造工作；而且因为朝鲜前线伟大胜利的鼓舞和爱国主义教育的普及深入，抗美援朝成为了推动一切工作的动力，加速了国家的建设。反过来，正是因为我们在建设工作上获得了巨大成就，所以我们的国力空前增涨，国防巩固，志愿军愈战愈强。从一九五零年十月二十五日起到今年八月底止，中朝人民军队歼灭了敌军六十万人，包括美国侵略军二十六万人。敌军被我们赶回到了“三八”线附近。我军建立了铜墙铁壁似的阵地。今后，跟着国家建设工作的推进，我们对志愿军的支援工作也会越加有力，朝鲜战场上的胜利就会更加巩固，从而就能争取到朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束和朝鲜问题的和平解决，把美帝国主义扩大战争的计划彻底粉碎。这样，我们就能更好地进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设。
