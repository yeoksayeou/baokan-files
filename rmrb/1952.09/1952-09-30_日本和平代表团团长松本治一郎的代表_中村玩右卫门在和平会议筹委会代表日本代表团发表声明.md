Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Nakamura Gan'uemon, representative of Matsumoto Jiichiro, head of the Japanese Peace Delegation attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, delivered a statement on behalf of the Japanese Delegation at the meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference on September 29th. The full text is as follows:

We, the Japanese Delegation, express our heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for creating an unprecedented opportunity for unity in the thousands of years of Asian history for the sake of peace among the nations of Asia and the Pacific.

The Japanese people have very high expectations and support for the Peace Conference, as can be clearly seen from the following fact: out of the four hundred and eighty-eight candidates directly elected by the people from all over Japan, the Japanese Peace Delegation was formed, including former Vice-Chairman of the House of Councillors, Matsumoto Jiichiro, as the head, and sixty members including Oyama Ikuo, the recipient of the Stalin Peace Prize.

Despite the despicable means used by the Yoshida government to obstruct our delegation from going abroad, such as refusing to issue passports and instructing thugs to attack us, more than a dozen of us have still arrived in Beijing. There is no more powerful demonstration of the Japanese people's desire for peace and the strength of their struggle than this. At the same time, this fact proves that the Japanese people are already uniting their forces to strive for peace and are determined to work with the people of all countries to prevent war and defend peace.

We want to tell the people of all countries about this determination of the Japanese people. In a nutshell, this is: We will never allow war merchants at home and abroad to transform Japan once again into the largest base for aggression to threaten the peace of Asia and the Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese people are increasingly aware of the importance of their responsibilities, and are even more eager to unite with the people of all countries.

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, the capital of liberated China, signifies the great unity of the strength of the nations in this region. This makes the war merchants at home and abroad in Japan greatly fear. Their all-out efforts to prevent the Japanese people from participating in this conference is a clear proof of this.

The problem before us is to further strengthen and expand this unity.

In every respect, the Japanese people are closely related to the Chinese people. We firmly believe that it is the supreme glory of the Japanese people to be able to stand on a common battle line with the Chinese people and the nations of the Asian and Pacific regions, and to participate in the great cause of building a peaceful, friendly, and free Asia.

    【新华社二十九日讯】参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本和平代表团团长松本治一郎的代表中村玩右卫门二十九日在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会会议上代表日本代表团发表声明，全文如下：
    我们日本代表团对中国人民为亚洲及太平洋各民族的和平而创造了亚洲几千年历史上空前未有的大团结的机会，表示衷心的感谢。
    日本国民对和平会议是寄予极大的期待和支持的，这可以从下面的事实中清楚地看出来：由日本全国各地国民所直接选出的四百八十八名候选人中，产生了以前参议院副议长松本治一郎为团长、包括获得斯大林和平奖金的大山郁夫等六十名的日本和平代表团。
    尽管吉田政府用拒绝发给护照、指使暴徒袭击等一切的卑鄙手段来阻挠我们代表团出国，但我们十几个人现在仍然抵达北京了，再没有比这个更有力地说明了日本国民对和平的热望及其斗争的力量；同时，这个事实证明：日本国民已经在把他们的力量团结起来争取和平，并有决心要和各国人民一道来防止战争，保卫和平。
    我们要把日本国民的这个决心告诉各国人民，一言以蔽之，这就是：无论如何绝不允许国内外的战争贩子们重新变日本为侵略的最大据点，来威胁亚洲及太平洋的和平。日本国民因此日益觉悟到自己所担负责任之重大，所以更加热望与各国人民团结起来。
    在解放了的中国首都——北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，正意味着这一区域的各民族的力量的大团结，这使日本国内外的战争贩子们大感恐惧；他们倾其全力阻挠日本国民来参加这次会议，便是一个显然的证明。
    摆在我们面前的问题，就是更要加强和扩大这个团结。
    从任何方面说，日本国民是与中国人民休戚相关的。我们深信：能够和中国人民以及亚洲及太平洋区域各民族站在共同的战线上，参加建设和平、友好与自由的亚洲的伟大事业，这是日本国民的无上光荣。

    一九五二年九月二十九日
