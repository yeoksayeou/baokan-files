Sever the Criminal Bloodstained Hands of American Germ Warfare Criminals
--A Record of the Pathology Section of the Exhibition of American Government's Germ Warfare Crimes

The fact that the American military conducted germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China is now a universally known fact. Respected experts from China have identified and analyzed many types of bacteria from the insects and other objects dropped by American planes. The reason that the germ warfare carried out by the American government has not caused epidemics is due to the victorious and widespread mass-based epidemic prevention and hygiene campaigns launched by the Chinese and Korean people.

However, after the American government carried out germ warfare, deaths have occurred in some areas of China and Korea. In the third and fourth exhibition rooms of the Exhibition of American Government's Germ Warfare Crimes, examples of respiratory anthrax leading to hemorrhagic anthrax meningitis, acute encephalitis discovered in Northeast China, and cholera and plague discovered in Korea are displayed.

On the right-hand curtain of the third exhibition room, examples of respiratory anthrax inducing hemorrhagic anthrax meningitis are displayed. Patients with this disease suddenly appeared one after another after American planes invaded and scattered insects and other objects carrying anthrax bacilli. The deceased had participated in eliminating insects or feathers dropped by American planes carrying anthrax bacilli, and they were infected while doing this work. After autopsy and identification by Chinese pathologists and bacteriologists, it was determined that the occurrence of this disease was caused by the American government's germ warfare. Next to this explanation are eleven photographs of the brain, spinal cord, lungs and other diseased parts of the deceased from respiratory anthrax.

On the middle curtain on the right side of this exhibition room, evidence of American planes spreading encephalitis in certain areas of Northeast China is displayed. After research by famous Chinese pathologists, this type of case is considered to be an acute infectious disease never seen before in China. Below the explanation are six photographs of the brain lesions of encephalitis victims.

Both of these diseases are cases of sudden death, with most people dying within 48 hours of onset. The symptoms of the former are headache, coma, nausea and vomiting, meningeal irritation symptoms, and fever. The symptoms of the latter are: high fever, generally above 39 degrees Celsius; the patient is unconscious and talks incoherently; headache; vomiting; and if it is a child, there are also symptoms of convulsions. Although these symptoms are not different from general encephalitis, and the brain lesions are not very obvious, the ironclad fact is that it can cause a healthy person to die suddenly within 48 hours. Does this not fully illustrate that the American germ warfare criminals used a specially made potent toxin to poison people's brains, so that there was no time to cause more brain lesions before the person died?

From the pathological anatomy point of view, people who get this disease have special pneumonia lesions in some cases in addition to encephalitis lesions. People who get this disease often develop lesions in a small part of one lobe of the lung (the human lung is generally divided into five lobes, two on the left and three on the right), which is different from the whole lobe lesions of lobar pneumonia; it is also different from the more widely distributed bronchopneumonia. Generally speaking, this single, small, localized pneumonia is rare.

People may remember that Japanese encephalitis B once prevailed in China. However, if the characteristics of Japanese encephalitis B are compared with the encephalitis found this time, there are the following significant differences: Different seasons: the first case of the former appears every year after July, and there is never encephalitis B between March and April; the latter occurs in March when the weather is still quite cold. Different heat courses: the former has a longer heat course, generally more than six days; the latter has a short heat course, many in two days, and the most does not exceed six days. Different pathological changes: in addition to being more significant and extensive than the latter, the former also has many necrotic spots.

If the above facts are linked to the intrusion of American planes into the airspace of Northeast China, especially the sudden occurrence of this disease that we have never seen after the intrusion of American planes, is there any doubt that these encephalitis deaths were caused by American germ warfare?

As soon as I entered the fourth exhibition room, I saw the explanation and pictures displaying "Evidence of American planes spreading cholera in Korea." At this time, I seemed to hear again the angry accusation of Han Zhushui, a family member of the victim whom I personally heard in Pyongyang, Korea, on April 7 this year:

"I went home for dinner on the morning of March 7 and saw that my 68-year-old father (Han Xiangguo) was sick, vomiting and diarrhea, the stool was like rice soup, and his eyes were sunken. I immediately asked my 12-year-old child Qinghuan to find a doctor. After the doctor came, he asked him. He said: I have never eaten anything bought on the street, no outsiders have come, and I have not left Pyongyang myself. Only on the morning of March 5, I put out flies. The doctor diagnosed that he had severe dehydration. Because of excessive diarrhea, lack of water, sunken eyes, dry skin, weak pulse, cold hands and feet, and body temperature dropped below the normal limit (35 degrees Celsius), leg muscle cramps. Because the disease was so severe, despite the efforts of doctors and nurses, my father finally died at 8 am on March 8. My six-year-old child Qingxie and two-year-old child Qingchun developed the same disease in the afternoon of March 7 and died at 8 pm and 10 pm on March 8 respectively. My lover, my twelve-year-old child Qinghuan and I were not at home on the morning of March 5. After my father fell ill, the doctor isolated us, so we did not get sick."

Cui Doushe, a clerk at a textile factory in Pyongyang, said: "Han Xiangguo and his two young grandchildren were with me when I was sweeping the yard on the morning of March 5. I saw an paper package in the old man's hand. He said at the time: "I don't know which child is mischievous and packed a package of flies"! I learned from Secretary Park's statement at the factory that these flies may have been dropped by American planes on the night of the 4th. I burned the flies and paper package with old man Han Xiangguo. After I came back, I carefully disinfected before eating breakfast. When I left, I told them to disinfect carefully, because they ate without washing their hands when they came back, so they were infected."

In this exhibition room, another case of cholera is also displayed: on the night of May 16 this year, an American plane circled at low altitude for a long time in Cheli, Gaoping Township, Datong County, Pingan South Road. On the morning of the 17th, Li Yingzi, the wife of Zhao Wanfu, a merchant in the area, found a straw bag on a nearby mountain containing mussels. She brought these mussels home and ate them raw with her husband according to Korean customs. Both of them got sick that night, vomiting, diarrhea, and died one after another on the night of the 18th.

Tian Shiyin, professor and bacteriologist of Pyongyang Medical University, conducted detailed bacteriological and serological examinations of Han Xiangguo's stool. He used the stool smear method to find a large number of active vibrios in the stool. Pathological and bacteriological examinations after the death of Zhao Wanfu and Li Yingzi proved that both died of true cholera. Cholera vibrios were also found in the remaining mussels found in Zhao Wanfu's kitchen and in two complete mussels taken from four straw bags found by the local self-defense team on the same mountain on May 19.

Korea is not the source of cholera, there is no infection center, and no cholera has occurred in the area under the jurisdiction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea since 1947. According to historical materials, cholera in Korea mostly occurred in August, September, and October, and never in March when the weather was still quite cold. However, this time, true cholera in Pyongyang occurred in March, and after American planes spread flies and ate mussels containing cholera vibrios, Han Xiangguo and his two generations of grandchildren and Zhao Wanfu and his wife were taken away by American germ warfare. Isn't this an obvious fact?

The fourth exhibition room of the exhibition also displays evidence that the American aggressors spread plague in Korea. It is a universally recognized fact that there has been no plague in Korea for many years. Page 15 of a report on Korean epidemics published by the US Navy Department in 1946 also affirmatively stated that there has been no plague in Korea for many years. Next to this explanation is the original of the report.

In Korea, where there is no plague, the American aggressors attempted to artificially spread plague by dropping rats from the air with planes to achieve the bloody goal of killing a large number of Korean people and Chinese and Korean troops.

On the morning of February 20 this year, Huang Shengchang, a sentry from a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, personally saw an American plane circling over Lantian Station near Qiuchang, Ningbian County, Pingan North Road, dropping an object that did not explode when it landed. When he went to see it, he found a rectangular green wooden box, about half a meter long, with many small holes on all sides. The box was broken when it landed, and there was a dead rat next to the broken box. On February 29 this year, Zhang Shunyu, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed in Tongchuan County, Jiangyuan Road, found two dead rats near the shrapnel dropped by an American plane. One of them was dissected by Chinese bacteriologist Fang Liang, and the internal organs were taken for culture. The strains isolated were identified as plague bacilli after detailed bacteriological, biochemical, serological and animal inoculation tests.

Three plague cases are also displayed at the exhibition:

Ge Quanshu, male, 21 years old, entered Korea in November 1950. After entering Korea, he never left Korea. He suddenly fell ill on the afternoon of March 4 this year and died on March 7.

Chang Jinlong, male, 21 years old, was previously in good health and had not traveled far for three months before the onset of the disease. He fell ill on the afternoon of March 7 this year and died at 6 am on the 8th.

Park Yanhao, male, 26 years old, a farmer from Jiangxi County, Pingan South Road, was previously in good health. He fell ill on April 2, with high fever, chills, headache, and died on April 4.

After the death of these three patients, heart blood was taken and cultured, and the strains isolated were identified as plague bacilli after detailed bacteriological, biochemical and animal inoculation tests.

Next to the cases are photos of the remains and cemetery of martyr Ge Quanshu and a blood smear of martyr Chang Jinlong. I also saw the plague bacilli isolated from their heart blood under a microscope.

Plague generally starts to occur and spread in the warm season of summer. This time, the plague in Korea occurred in the cold season below zero degrees Celsius. This further shows that the occurrence of these three plague patients was artificial and directly caused by the American aggressors' germ warfare.

In order to stop germ warfare, in order to avenge the Chinese and Korean martyrs killed by American germ warfare, and in order to prevent people all over the world from being killed by American germ warfare again, all peace-loving people in the world must unite and sever the criminal bloodstained hands of the American germ warfare criminals!

    斩断美国细菌战犯们的罪恶血手
    ——记美国政府细菌战罪行展览会的病理部分
    新华社记者  林麟
    美国军队在朝鲜和我国东北等地进行细菌战，这已是举世周知的事实。我国具有声望的各种专家已从美国飞机投下的昆虫和其他物体中，鉴定和化验出许多种病菌。到现在为止，美国政府所进行的细菌战，所以没有引起疫病流行，这是中朝人民胜利地广泛地开展群众性防疫卫生运动的结果。
    但是，在美国政府进行细菌战以后，在中、朝的部分地区，已经发生了死亡病例。在美国政府细菌战罪行展览会的第三、第四陈列室里，就陈列了我国东北地区发现的呼吸系统的炭疽病诱致出血性炭疽杆菌脑膜炎、急性脑炎和朝鲜发现的霍乱、鼠疫这四方面的例证。
    第三陈列室的右面布幕上，陈列了呼吸系统炭疽病诱致出血性炭疽杆菌脑膜炎的例证。这种病的患者是在美机侵入撒布带有炭疽杆菌的昆虫和其他物体之后，突然相继发生的。死者生前参加过消灭美机投下带有炭疽杆菌的昆虫或羽毛，他们是在做这种工作时受到感染的。死者经我国的病理学家和细菌学家解剖、鉴定，断定这种病的发生，是美国政府进行细菌战所造成的。在这说明的旁边陈列了呼吸系统炭疽病死者的脑、脊髓、肺等部病变的十一张照片。
    在这间陈列室的右面中间布幕上，陈列着美国飞机在我国东北某些地区撒布脑炎的证据。这种病例，经过我国著名的病理学家研究，认为是在我国从来没有见过的一种急性传染病。在说明下面，陈列了脑炎死者脑部病变的六张照片。
    这两种病都是急死病例，多数得病的人在发病后四十八小时内死亡。前者的症状是头痛、昏迷、恶心呕吐、脑膜刺激症状、发烧。后者的症状是：发高热，一般在三十九度以上；病者昏迷不醒，乱说话；头痛；呕吐；如果是小孩，又有惊厥（抽风）的症状。这种症状，虽然与一般脑炎没有什么不同，脑的病变也不十分明显，但铁的事实是：它竟能在四十八小时内引起健康的人突然死亡。这不正足以说明：美国细菌战犯们是以一种特制的强力毒素使人们脑部中毒，以致没有时间引起脑部更多的病变，人就死亡了吗？
    从病理解剖方面看来，得这种病的人除脑炎病变之外，一部分病例还有特殊的肺炎病变。得这种病的人，常常在肺的一叶（人的肺一般分为五叶，左边二叶，右边三叶）中的一小部分发生病变，它不同于大叶肺炎的全叶病变；也不同于支气管肺炎的散布比较广泛。一般说，这种单个的、小型的、局限的肺炎是很少见的。
    人们也许记得在我国曾流行过日本乙型脑炎。但是，如果把日本乙型脑炎的特征和此次发现的脑炎比，就有下面显著的不同：季节不同：前者每年第
    一个病例都出现在七月以后，在三四月间从来没有乙型脑炎发生；后者却在天气还相当寒冷的三月间发生。热程不同：前者热程较长，一般在六日以上；后者热程短，不少的在二日，最多的也不超出六日。病理变化不同：前者的病变除较后者的较为显著而广泛外，还有许多坏死点。
    如果把上述事实，和美国飞机侵入我国东北领空联系起来，特别是美国飞机侵入后就突然发生这一种我们从未见过的疾病联系起来，这些脑炎死者是美国细菌战造成的，还有什么可怀疑的吗？
    一走进第四陈列室，我就看到陈列着“美国飞机在朝鲜撒布霍乱的证据”的说明和图片。这时，我的耳中仿佛重新震荡着今年四月七日我在朝鲜平壤市亲自听到的受难者家属韩洙演的愤怒控诉：
    “我在三月七日早晨回家吃饭，看见我六十八岁的老父亲（韩相国）生病，上吐下泻，大便像米汤一样，眼睛凹陷，我马上叫我的十二岁小孩庆焕去找医生。医生来后问他，他说：没有吃过街上买的东西，没有外人来过，自己也没有离开平壤，只是在三月五日清晨，扑灭过蝇子。医生诊断，发现他有严重的脱水现象。因泻多，水份不足，眼凹陷，皮肤干燥，脉弱，手脚冰凉，体温降到正常限度之下（三十五度），腿肌肉痉挛。因病势猛烈，虽经过医生护士努力治疗，我父亲终于在三月八日上午八时病故。我的六岁小孩庆燮、二岁小孩庆淳在三月七日下午发生同样疾病，在三月八日晚八时、十时先后死去。我和我的爱人及十二岁孩子庆焕在三月五日上午都不在家，我父亲发病后，医生便把我们隔离开，所以没有得病。”
    平壤某纺织工厂事务员崔斗燮说：“三月五日早上扫院子时，韩相国老人和他的二个小孙都和我在
    一起，我看见老人手上有一个纸包，他当时还说：
    ‘不知那个小孩恶作剧，包了一包苍蝇’！我因为在工厂里学习过朴外务相的声明，我知道这些蝇子可能就是四日夜间美国飞机丢下来的。我就同韩相国老人把蝇子和纸包一同烧毁。我回来后，经过仔细消毒才吃早饭。临走时，我叮嘱他们也要仔细消毒，因他们回来未洗手就端饭吃，所以受了传染。”
    在这间陈列室里，还陈列了另一霍乱病例：今年五月十六日夜，美机在平安南道大同郡高平面车里，低空盘旋许久。十七日清晨，该地商人赵万福之妻李英子在附近山上发现一个草包，内装蚌蛤，他把这些蚌蛤带回家中和她丈夫一道按朝鲜的习惯生吃了，当晚两人都得了病，呕吐，腹泻，相继于十八日晚死亡。
    韩相国的大便，经平壤市医科大学教授细菌学家田世殷，做了详细的细菌学和血清学的检查，用大便涂片法，发现大便内有大量的活动的弧菌。赵万福、李英子在死后经病理学及细菌学检验，证明两人均死于真性霍乱。在赵万福厨房内发现的残余蚌蛤及五月十九日该地自卫队在同一山上发现四个草包中拿出的二个完整的蚌蛤，做了细菌学检查，也找到霍乱弧菌。
    朝鲜不是霍乱发源地，没有传染中心，一九四七年以来，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府辖区内就没有发生过霍乱。根据历史材料看，朝鲜以往发生的霍乱，多在八、九、十三个月，从没有在天气还相当寒冷的三月发生过霍乱。而这次平壤市的真性霍乱却在三月发生，而且又在美国飞机撒布蝇类及吃了含有霍乱弧菌的蚌蛤之后，韩相国祖孙二代和赵万福夫妇是被美国的细菌战夺去了生命，不是十分明显的事实吗？
    展览会的第四陈列室，还陈列了美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布鼠疫的证据。朝鲜多年来没有鼠疫，这已是举世公认的事实。美国海军部一九四六年印发的关于朝鲜流行病的报告一书的第十五页上，也肯定地说：朝鲜多年来没有鼠疫。在这说明的旁边，还陈列了该报告的原件。
    在没有鼠疫的朝鲜，美国侵略者企图以人为的方法，用飞机从空中投放老鼠撒布鼠疫，来达到大量杀死朝鲜人民和中朝部队的血腥目的。
    今年二月二十日上午，中国人民志愿军某部哨兵黄胜昌，在平安北道宁边郡球场附近蓝田车站，亲见美国飞机一架，在车站上空盘旋，投下一物，落地未炸，当他去看时，发现一只长方形的绿色木箱，长约半公尺，四边有许多小孔，箱子落地已摔破，破箱子旁边有一只死老鼠。今年二月二十九日，驻江原道通川郡某地的中国人民志愿军战士张顺玉，在美国飞机投下的弹片附近，发现死鼠二只。其中的一只经我国细菌学家方亮解剖后，取内脏作培养，分离出的菌种经过了详细的细菌学、生物化学、血清学和动物接种的试验、鉴定为鼠疫杆菌。
    在展览会上，还陈列了三个鼠疫病例：
    葛权书，男，二十一岁，于一九五○年十一月间入朝，入朝后没有离开过朝鲜，今年三月四日下午突然发病，于三月七日死亡。
    常金龙，男，二十一岁，以往身体健康，发病前三个月没有远行。今年三月七日下午发病，于八日上午六时死亡。
    朴延浩，男，二十六岁，农民，平安南道江西郡人，以往身体健康，四月二日发病，高热，恶寒，头痛，四月四日死亡。
    这三个病人死后，均采取了心血，作了细菌培养，所分离出的菌种，经过了详细的细菌学、生物化学和动物接种的试验，鉴定为鼠疫杆菌。
    在病例的旁边，还有葛权书烈士的遗体、墓地的照片和常金龙烈士的心血涂片。我从显微镜里也看到从他们心血上分离出的鼠疫杆菌。
    鼠疫一般地是在夏季温暖季节开始发生和流行的。这次朝鲜的鼠疫却发生在摄氏零度以下的寒冷季节。这就进一步的表明：这三个鼠疫病人的发生是人为的，是美国侵略者的细菌战所直接造成的。
    为了制止细菌战，为了给美国细菌战杀害的中朝烈士报仇，为了使全世界的人民不再受到美国细菌战的杀害，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，必须一致奋起，斩断美国细菌战犯们的罪恶血手！
