    Gu Ye Railway Station's Self-Criticism Regarding the Accident of Crushing a Worker to Death
    To the Editor: The criticism made by Yang Zifeng and Liang Bucheng in the People's Daily's "Reader's Letters" column on August 12th regarding the accident of our station repeatedly crushing workers to death is entirely correct. In the past, our implementation of operating procedures and safety regulations was indeed formalistic. We did not educate employees to understand the spirit of the regulations so that they would consciously comply, nor did we check on the employees' implementation of the regulations, allowing them to develop on their own. What is particularly serious is that some of our cadres even considered taking risks to be appropriate, making actions that did not comply with safety regulations legitimate. As a result, accidents involving worker deaths and injuries occurred one after another, causing unnecessary losses. This proves that our administrative leaders (especially myself) did not deeply understand the situation in our work and had serious bureaucratic tendencies. In addition to accepting this correct criticism, we have begun a mass inspection throughout the station in August and strengthened the implementation of safety regulations to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future.

### 古冶车站关于轧死工人事故的检讨

    古冶车站关于轧死工人事故的检讨
    编辑同志：八月十二日人民日报读者来信栏刊载杨紫枫、梁步成对我站连续轧死工人事故的批评，这一批评是完全正确的。过去我们对操作规程和安全制度的执行确实是形式主义的。我们没有教育职工领会制度、规程的精神，以便自觉地遵守，也没有检查职工执行规程、制度的情况，而让其自流发展。尤其严重的，是我们有些干部竟认为冒险是应当的，使不遵守安全规程操作的行为成为合法。因此便连续发生了工人死伤事故，造成不应有的损失。这证明我们行政领导干部（尤其是我）在工作中不深入了解情况，有严重的官僚主义作风。我们除接受这一正确批评外，并从八月份开始，在全站进行一次群众性的检查，并加强安全制度的执行，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
