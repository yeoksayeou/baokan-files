Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th: August is the rainy season in Korea. The front lines were shrouded in dark clouds for days, and heavy rain poured down. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers overcame various difficulties in the rainy season and continued to strike the enemy with various tactics. In this month, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies annihilated a total of 24,191 enemy troops, of which 10,816 were American invading troops. This is the month with the highest number of enemies annihilated since last December.

The battle for a hilltop southeast of Kimhwa and the seven-day battle for a high ground east of the Bukhan River were the two major ground battles in August. From August 5th to 8th, our army engaged in repeated battles with enemy troops on a hilltop south of Joasudong, southeast of Kimhwa, killing and wounding more than 600 enemy troops. From August 11th, an outpost unit of our army engaged in a seven-day battle with enemy troops on an unnamed high ground east of the Bukhan River, annihilating a total of 1,000 enemy troops. Our army has firmly held this position.

The American invading troops and their accomplice troops launched 87 intrusions this month, but each intrusion suffered a tragic defeat in front of our army's strong defensive positions. The Turkish accomplice troops launched three intrusions in the area east of Mundung-ri on the eastern front from the 22nd to the 24th, but were all repelled by our army, with more than 100 enemy troops killed or wounded. The small-scale offensive battles launched by our army frequently annihilated platoons and companies of enemies. For example, in the area south of Goseong on the east coast, a unit of our army once captured an enemy hilltop position in one fell swoop, completely annihilating an entire company of the defending Rhee's puppet army.

The artillery units of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are increasingly showing themselves to be an important force in striking the enemy. In August, our army's artillery units fired accurate and fierce artillery fire at enemy positions every day. The enemy troops killed and wounded by our army's artillery fire averaged more than 257 people per day, which is equivalent to more than one company's strength. This month, our army's artillery fire killed and wounded a total of 7,978 enemy troops, accounting for 33% of the total number of enemies annihilated in the month. This figure is nearly one and a half times more than the number of enemy troops killed by artillery fire in July, and 1,502 more than the total number of enemies annihilated in the entire month of February this year. Our army's powerful artillery fire also destroyed and damaged 99 enemy tanks, 97 vehicles, 50 cannons, and 70 light and heavy machine guns; destroyed 273 enemy bunkers and 288 shelters.

The sniper movement of our army's infantry units using cold guns and cold cannons to kill and wound the enemy has been carried out more widely and effectively on the front lines, and many alert, brave, and accurate snipers have emerged. In August, snipers shot and wounded a total of 5,716 enemy troops, 2,190 more than the 3,526 in July.

The battle situation in August clearly shows that: although the American generals are still screaming hoarsely about the long-bankrupt "naval and air force attacks," the strength of the American invading troops and their accomplice troops is suffering greater and greater losses on the Korean battlefield. The clamor of a small group of American generals cannot conceal their heavy military defeats in delaying the Korean armistice negotiations.

The comprehensive battle results of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in August are as follows (incomplete statistics):

I. Annihilated 24,191 enemy troops. This includes 10,816 American troops, 1,490 British troops, 178 Turkish troops, and 11,707 Rhee's puppet troops.

II. Main Captures: 2 60mm mortars, 1 flame thrower, 1 90mm bazooka, 76 light and heavy machine guns, 403 various guns, 240 landmines, 3 radio stations, and 15 various communication devices.

III. Shot down and damaged 400 enemy aircraft, of which 167 were shot down and 233 were damaged; destroyed 63 enemy tanks and damaged 56; destroyed 91 enemy vehicles and damaged 60; destroyed 68 enemy cannons and damaged 9; sank 1 enemy destroyer, 1 landing craft, and 1 minesweeper.

    我军八月份歼敌两万四千
    共击落击伤敌军飞机四百架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】八月份正是朝鲜的雨季，战线上连日阴云密布，大雨滂沱。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军克服雨季中的各种困难，继续以各种战术手段打击敌人。在这一个月中，朝中人民军队共计歼灭敌军两万四千一百九十一名，其中一万零八百十六名是美国侵略军。这是自去年十二月以来歼敌数量最多的一个月。
    金城东南一个山头的争夺战和北汉江以东某高地连续七天的争夺战，是八月份地面战斗中较大的两次战斗。八月五日至八日，我军在金城东南座首洞以南的一个山头上与敌军进行反复的争夺战，杀伤敌军六百多名。从八月十一日起，我军一支前哨部队在北汉江以东一个无名高地上与敌军进行了连续七天的争夺战，共歼灭敌军一千名。我军一直把这个阵地紧紧地掌握在自己手中。
    美国侵略军及其帮凶军在这一个月中进行了八十七次窜犯，但各次窜犯都在我军坚强的防御阵地面前遭到了悲惨的失败。土耳其帮凶军曾于二十二日至二十四日在东线的文登里以东地区进行三次窜犯，都被我军击退，敌军死伤一百多名。而我军所进行的小规模攻击战，却经常地歼灭成排成连的敌人。如在东海岸高城以南地区，我军某部就曾一举攻占敌军一个山头阵地，全歼守敌李伪军一个整连。
    朝中人民炮兵部队日益显示出是一支打击敌人的重要力量。在八月份中，我军炮兵部队每天都向敌人阵地发射准确而猛烈的炮火。被我军炮火杀伤的敌军，平均每天达二百五十七名以上，这等于一个多连的兵力。这个月我军炮火共杀伤敌军七千九百七十八名，占全月歼敌总数的百分之三十三。这个数字，比七月份炮火杀伤敌军数增加近一倍半，比今年二月份全月歼敌总数还多一千五百零二名。我军强大的炮火还击毁击伤了敌军坦克九十九辆，汽车九十七辆，炮五十门，轻重机枪七十挺；摧毁敌军地堡二百七十三个，掩体二百八十八个。
    我军步兵部队用冷枪冷炮毙伤敌人的狙击运动，已经在前线更加广泛和有效地开展起来，出现了许多机警、果敢、百发百中的狙击手。在八月份中，狙击手们共射死射伤敌军五千七百十六名，比七月份的三千五百二十六名多二千一百九十名。
    八月份的战况清楚地显示出：尽管美国将军们最近还在声嘶力竭地叫嚣早已破了产的“海空军攻击”，但是美国侵略军及其帮凶军的有生力量却在朝鲜战场上遭到愈来愈大的损失。一小撮美国将军们的叫嚣，是掩盖不住他们在拖延朝鲜停战谈判中军事上的惨重败绩的。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军八月份的综合战果如下（不完全统计）：
    一、歼灭敌军两万四千一百九十一名。其中包括美军一万零八百十六名，英军一千四百九十名，土耳其军一百七十八名，李伪军一万一千七百零七名。
    二、主要缴获：六零炮两门、火焰喷射器一具、九零火箭筒一具、轻重机枪七十六挺。各种枪四百零三枝、地雷二百四十个、电台三部、各种通话机十五部。
    三、击落击伤敌军飞机四百架，其中一百六十七架被击落，二百三十三架被击伤；击毁敌军坦克六十三辆，击伤五十六辆；击毁敌军汽车九十一辆，击伤六十辆；击毁敌军各种炮六十八门，击伤九门；击沉敌军驱逐舰、登陆艇、扫雷艇各一艘。
