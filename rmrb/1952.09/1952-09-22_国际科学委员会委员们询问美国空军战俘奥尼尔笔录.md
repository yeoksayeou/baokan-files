    International Scientific Commission Members Question U.S. Air Force POW O'Neill Record
    The International Scientific Commission, investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, questioned U.S. Air Force POW O'Neill. The text is as follows:
    Interpreter: Lieutenant O'Neill, please state your full name, rank, and address. Also, what instructions did you receive regarding bacteriological warfare?
    O'N: My full name is Floyd Brilliant O'Neill. I am a Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Service number A0-1848575. My family's address is: P.O. Box 66, Moyer Road, Fairfax, South Carolina. I attended two classes on bacteriological warfare. The first was on December 1, 1951, at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona. This class was very brief, only lasting thirty minutes. The second class was at the K-46 Korean forward base of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. The date was January 22, 1952. This class talked about the bacteriological weapons we were to use, and the content was much more complete. This class lasted about two hours. After that, the only other instruction I received was, of course, the order to carry out the bacteriological warfare mission.
    Andreen (Sweden, hereinafter referred to as And): When you were taking the class, did they clearly tell you that bacteriological warfare was already underway?
    O'N: My answer to this question is: No, not during the first class at Luke. It was mentioned in the second class at K-46.
    Martel (France, hereinafter referred to as Mart): Mr. O'Neill, can you tell us how many pilots attended each of these two classes?
    O'N: Yes, sir. When the first class was held at Luke Air Force Base, there were about seventy students attending, which was the entire student body of the gunnery school. About forty of them were from the F-84 fighter-bomber squadron, and about thirty were from the F-51 fighter-bomber squadron.
    Mart: What about the second class?
    O'N: Only four of us attended the second class, four out of the ten new pilots assigned to the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. We had to take the class because we were new.
    Mart: According to your answer, can it be assumed that all the other pilots at this base had already received bacteriological warfare training?
    O'N: Yes, sir. At K-46 base, all the pilots had previously received bacteriological warfare training.
    Mart: Did they try to find excuses for why they were using this weapon during their lectures, or did they simply start explaining the various technical methods directly?
    O'N: They didn't offer any explanations. In the first class, they meant it like this... the lecturer said that the purpose of giving this class was to give us a basic understanding of this area. Nothing else was mentioned. In the second class here in Korea, they didn't mention the reason at all. The lecturer started by talking about the methods of using bacteriological weapons.
    Mart: Please tell us how you were captured, okay?
    O'N: Yes, sir. On March 4, 1952, I was ordered to fly to an area about ten miles west of Sinmak in North Korea to cut off the railway line. At about 9:15, I was hit by anti-aircraft fire. My plane was unable to fly, so I parachuted down into a rice paddy and was immediately captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    Mart: Were you alone in the plane?
    O'N: Yes, sir, I was alone in the plane.
    There were two other people on this mission, but I was alone in the plane.
    Mart: How many bacteriological warfare missions have you carried out?
    O'N: One, sir.
    Mart: What were your feelings? What was your state of mind when you carried out that bacteriological warfare mission?
    O'N: Honestly, I have never been so nervous in my life. I also felt that the mission was not an ordinary task, but more like a funeral. I never wanted to participate in bacteriological warfare. It is difficult to describe my feelings at that time. I think you must say that I was cowardly to do such a thing at someone else's command. I certainly had such thoughts in my mind at the time. These thoughts were deep in my heart, and you could say that I swallowed this idea like a bitter pill, forcing it down. I tried not to think about it.
    Mart: Maybe you tried hard to suppress this kind of thinking at that time, but you probably thought about your own family back home, what would you think if such a weapon one day fell on your family members?
    O'N: Yes, sir. I thought about this a lot. This was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced. I knew that what I was doing was a despicable act that violated all humanitarian rules. Of course, what scared me the most was the thought of how terrible it would be if such a disaster were to befall my family.
    Needham (England, hereinafter referred to as Need): Dr. Martel said that he feels he has asked enough questions and is willing to let others ask questions, but he would like to ask some technical questions later.
    Need: Before everyone else raises questions, I would like to talk about some overlooked issues and ask a question about international law and the conventions of war. I have said in previous meetings of this committee that, in my impression, it seems that in the British army, they have some King's Regulations and Army Rules, some of which mention recognized conventions of war, such as not killing prisoners or other similar things. I don't know if Mr. O'Neill has ever seen explanations of war conventions, treatment of prisoners of war, etc., in the U.S. Air Force handbook, and whether there are any regulations regarding bacteriological warfare in it. If so, has he ever thought that he could legally refuse to carry out orders to conduct bacteriological warfare? I think this is a very important and interesting point that should be investigated and clarified.
    O'N: No, sir. I have studied many military regulations during my training in the Reserve Officer Training Corps and during my service in the Air Force, but I have never come across any articles that talk about this kind of thing, that is, about prohibiting any weapons or talking about the humanitarian principles of war. It was only after I was shot down, that is, after I was captured, that I saw the Geneva Protocol explicitly prohibiting bacteriological warfare. I had never heard of such a protocol before.
    Oliver (Italy, hereinafter referred to as Oli): You have presented a confession about bacteriological warfare. What prompted you to provide these confessions, both what you are telling us now and what you have talked about in other meetings?
    O'N: First, I feel I should clarify that I am making these confessions completely voluntarily. I have not been subjected to physical or mental pressure. If I have suffered any mental pain, it is the inner pain I feel for my own actions. There is no doubt that this pain was not inflicted on me by others. This is my own doing because I actually participated in bacteriological warfare. Therefore, I feel I should say that my reason and soul, or my heart, drive me to say it. Whatever you call it, it is something inside me that is pressing down. I felt as tense as a tightly wound clock spring, but suddenly it snapped. I had to speak out. It is because of the terrible things I have done, the pain, that I cannot remain silent. I think that process of realization was the most painful period I have ever experienced. The intellectual development – if I can put it that way – of realizing what terror and destruction I have caused to the people, what pain I have brought to them. I also felt that the world should know the situation of bacteriological warfare here in Korea. Everyone should know the truth. The world should be told how the American army used this weapon against innocent people. This realization made me even more determined to speak out. It can be said that before I made my confession, my conscience was locked up. Later, after I felt sincerely willing for everyone to know about this inhuman war, I made my confession. I want to stand before the world and help them beat up those who advocate the use of this weapon.
    Oli: When you made your confession, did you think that doing so would help reveal the facts of bacteriological warfare?
    O'N: Yes, sir, I thought so at the time. I believe that what someone who has participated in bacteriological warfare and done such a thing says can at least generate some force to let everyone know about it.
    Zhukov-Veresnikov (Soviet Union, hereinafter referred to as Zh): What were the reactions of your comrades after they learned that the American army was conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea? Can you talk about it?
    O'N: Well, sir, I can only describe the feelings of the other three pilots who took the second class with me. Because I only noticed the immediate reaction on those three when they knew that the American army was conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. Among them and a few of us, I think the most important feeling at the time was a sense of terror and disgust. Of course, we were also surprised at the time. That is... as I said before, I felt like I was going to someone else's funeral. We were warned that we were not allowed to talk about this matter, not even among ourselves. Therefore, after we finished the class, because we had just been told not to talk about it, none of us said anything. It can be said that the four of us were too shocked to speak. I know that I felt strange at the time: peace negotiations are underway in Kaesong, and the war has actually stopped, so why are we using bacteriological weapons in Korea? It is difficult for me to say what others were thinking. I can only judge based on their facial expressions and their actions.
    This was the reaction I observed when we first learned about bacteriological warfare. Of course, the later reactions were completely different. According to our observations, I could tell which other pilots had just carried out a bacteriological warfare mission—they all looked disheartened. They were very gloomy. They were so silent that it made people suspicious because usually the pilots were very talkative all day long. They talked to each other about what they had done, told new jokes, talked about news from home, etc. But those who had just carried out bacteriological warfare missions were terribly gloomy. At night, you could often see them drinking heavily in the club to relieve their sorrows.
    And: I would like to know the date and location of your bacteriological warfare mission.
    O'N: I carried out my first and only bacteriological warfare mission this year, in 1952, on February 15th. Our target was the town of Sibyon in North Korea. There were four of us on this flight, each carrying two germ bombs, for a total of eight. We didn't know what kind of germs were inside – we only knew that they were germ bombs.
    Interpreter: You said these bombs contained germs, right?
    O'N: Yes, germ bombs, but I didn't know what kind of germs were inside.
    Need: Okay, we can come back to general things later. Now we can talk about technical questions. I would like to know if Mr. O'Neill heard the lecturer say that encephalitis was one of the diseases they might spread. Of course, there are common germs such as cholera, typhoid, plague, etc., but I don't know if they mentioned encephalitis.
    O'N: No, sir, they didn't mention it. They only mentioned the general diseases you just talked about. Nothing else was mentioned. However, I cannot say that there is absolutely no possibility of spreading encephalitis, because they were doing a lot of work.
    Oli: In those two classes, did they only talk about using airplanes for bacteriological warfare? Did they also talk about the possibility of using artillery – that is, using shells to fire bacteria out?
    O'N: Yes, sir. In the first class, they talked about this point. They said that germ weapons could also be loaded into artillery shells. The lecturer only said that there are various types of germs that can be loaded into artillery shells. He didn't say anything else, but he explained that the range of artillery is limited, while airplanes can drop germ bombs much further away.
    Need: Can Mr. O'Neill tell us about insect containers? What did they say about containers? For example, did they talk about self-destructing containers? Whether it is a container that can break into a large number of small fragments, or those made of some kind of paper-like material that can automatically ignite and burn.
    O'N: No, sir. They didn't mention this kind of self-destructing weapon. The first class was just a general overview, only talking about general issues in this area. In the second class, regarding bacteriological warfare weapons, they only talked about the various bombs used by the American army at that time. They also talked about leaves and paper infected with bacteria, which were the only other weapons mentioned besides germ bombs and germ artillery shells.
    Need: I would like to continue this question. I want to know, when talking about spreading objects, bacteria, or something else, what kind of container or bomb did they talk about using?
    Mart: Can you talk about the content of the two classes you took?
    O'N: Yes, sir. The first class at Luke Air Force Base was more or less a general description of bacteriological warfare. The class did not mention where bacteriological warfare was to be carried out. The lecturer began by telling us that the content of the class was secret. He then talked about how bacteriological warfare can be carried out in two ways: one is by artillery fire, and the other is by dropping bombs from airplanes. He pointed out that these two ways of throwing bacteria or germ-carrying insects each have their own advantages and disadvantages. He pointed out that the range of artillery is limited, while germ bombs can be dropped far behind enemy lines. In this class, we also learned that the American army and the American scientific institutions studying bacteriological warfare are researching bacteriological warfare. They are researching special bacteria and insects that can be used in cold climates and have already cultivated such bacteria and insects. The lecturer told us that the bacteria must undergo a cultivation procedure so that it can resist the cold. He called that procedure a climate adaptation process. That is to say, to put the bacteria in a gradually decreasing temperature and humidity. When they get used to the new temperature, then the temperature is lowered again. In this way, bacteria can gradually adapt to colder and colder climates.
    The lecturer also mentioned that they have also cultivated cold-resistant insects. This insect is cultivated by hybridization, that is, by mating an insect with the desired infectious disease characteristics with another similar cold-resistant insect. The offspring produced by these hybrids are then mated with cold-resistant insects again, so that an insect that can live in cold climates can be gradually obtained. This insect has both the desired infectious disease characteristics and can also get used to the cold climate.
    The content of the first class at Luke was probably like this. The lecturer was an Air Force Major Peter W. Williams. The officer who introduced him to us said that he had come specifically from Washington to give us this class. The major said that the work and research of cultivating cold-resistant bacteria and insects were carried out in a specialized institution at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. The Chemical Corps and the Army Ordnance Department have many laboratories in Aberdeen. The people working in Aberdeen include military personnel, that is, experts from all aspects of the army, and also civilian scientific workers who work for the government. Of course, when their own researchers encounter difficulties, the government also has the nation's top scientists available for consultation.
    The second class at K-46 base generally talked about what Major Williams did not talk about. As I said before, the second class was held on January 22nd. The lecturer was Captain McLaughlin, the intelligence officer of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. I don't know his initials, I only know that he was called "Captain Mac", everyone called him that. He was about thirty years old, over five feet ten inches tall, with black hair that was starting to turn gray. The four of us, Peter Neubauer, James Horsley, Greer, and I, were summoned to the group's operations office. Someone came to notify us that Captain McLaughlin wanted to see us. The captain led us to a small briefing room at the back of the house of the group's operations office. The room was very small, with a table inside, and I believe there were six chairs. There was a small blackboard on the wall at one end of the room.
        The captain began by saying to us that although our usual sorties were to be kept secret, we could still talk about them among ourselves. However, he then told us that the things he was about to tell us, the issues he was going to talk about, were extremely secret. In the Air Force – in the U.S. Air Force, extremely secret is the most confidential level of military intelligence. He emphasized this point to us several times, emphasizing that this was top secret, and then he began to talk to us about the techniques and various technical aspects of bacteriological warfare. He said that as far as the Air Force is concerned, there are two ways to conduct bacteriological warfare – that is, there are generally two types of bombs. One is an aerial burst bomb, that is, the bomb explodes in the air as it falls. This type of bomb is used to hold bacteria and cannot hold insects. The second type is a parachute bomb, which is dropped by parachute. This type of bomb is used to hold germ-carrying insects. Of course, in addition to bombs, insects – germ-carrying insects, or bacteria – can also be sprayed directly from the plane.
    Interpreter: When you say spraying, does that mean that insects can be sprayed and bacteria can be sprayed, both can?
        O'N: Yes, sir, both can. When the captain talked about this, he mentioned that our group – that is, the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group – only used aerial burst germ bombs and also carried out direct spraying missions. At that time, we did not use parachute germ bombs. The aerial burst germ bomb, which only contained bacteria, looked and was about the same size as an ordinary five hundred-pound bomb. The bomb body was about three feet long and about one and a half feet in diameter, but it was not as heavy as an ordinary five hundred-pound bomb. Its weight was probably between one hundred and fifty pounds and two hundred pounds. The shell of this bomb was very thin, only a quarter of an inch.
    This aerial burst bomb contained about one hundred pounds of gelatinous substance, which is a culture medium for breeding bacteria. The warhead is equipped with a fuse, and there is a little bit of explosive right behind it. There is not much explosive, just enough to spread the bacteria out over an area. The fuse itself is installed in the bomb head. This fuse is generally called a timed fuse, or an aerial burst fuse. That is to say, it causes the bomb to explode in the air about fifty to one hundred feet above the ground. This is a radar-controlled fuse that works on the principle of radar. The fuse part of the warhead is indeed equipped with a small radio controller. This fuse can be adjusted to explode at a certain distance from the ground. When the bomb falls to a certain height, it explodes and spreads the bacteria out.
    The other type of bomb that the captain talked about was the parachute-type bomb, which is used to drop germ-carrying insects. The parachute-type bomb is a bomb that is dropped by parachute. This type of bomb can usually be divided into two types. The first type only carries one type of insect. In other words, it just... the insects in the bomb are all of the same species. The warhead of this bomb has some kind of mechanical device. When the bomb hits the ground, the bomb body automatically splits in half, letting the insects inside run out. This bomb is the same size as other germ bombs, three feet long, one and a half feet wide, with a thin shell, only a quarter of an inch thick, and weighs one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds.
    Need: Hmm.
    O'N: The device that opens the bomb – that is, lets the bomb split open – includes a button on the warhead. When the bomb hits the ground, the impact with the ground connects the circuit inside the bomb. This button is connected to a battery and a small motor. When the small motor moves, it pulls open the latch that holds the bomb together, that is, holds the two halves of the bomb together. After this latch is released, the bomb splits open, and the insects inside will crawl out.
    The second type of parachute bomb is specifically used to drop several types of insects in one bomb. If I remember correctly, the captain said in the diagram that such a bomb can hold mosquitoes, gnats, spiders, and flies at the same time. This bomb is the same size as other bombs, three feet long, one and a half feet wide. The inside of this bomb is divided into four parts. Between each part there is a piece of cardboard or hard paper to isolate the insects inside. This isolation is necessary, especially to isolate the spiders, otherwise the spiders will run to other parts and kill the other insects. After the bomb lands, the insects inside also escape in the same way as in the first type of bomb. The only difference is that this bomb does not split into two halves. Each compartment of this bomb has a small door, and the mechanism for opening this door is the same as the first type of bomb. That is to say, the button first starts the small motor, the small motor opens the door of each compartment, and the germ-carrying insects run out.
    In these two types of parachute bombs, the parachute is attached to the tail of the bomb, that is, the end opposite the warhead. After the bomb hits the ground, the button connects the circuit. In the split-type bomb, it pulls out the latch, and in the other type of bomb, it opens the small doors of each compartment. At the same time, a pin connecting the parachute and the bomb is also pulled out, so that the parachute is either blown away by the wind or detaches and falls to the side. If there is no such device, the parachute may fall on the bomb and cover all the insects, so the insects will be useless.
    The captain then talked about the method of spraying bacteria or germ-carrying insects from airplanes. The spraying device is installed in the tail of the airplane, behind the pilot. Because of this spraying device, special work has to be done inside the airplane. The airplane has to be specially modified to install this spraying device. Generally speaking, there is a fuselage fuel tank behind the ordinary pilot's seat of an airplane. This fuel tank has to be removed, and the sprayer is installed in this position. The main part of this device is, of course, the box or container for holding bacteria and insects. The bacteria or insects pass through a thin tube, from the box all the way to the tail of the plane, where they are sprayed out at the tail of the plane.
    This box installed inside the plane is about three feet high and two feet wide. The bacteria or germ-carrying insects are brought in a container (a can). The bacteria or insects in the can are sent to the plane's box or container through a tube. The bacteria are brought in cans, in other words, the entire container is made of tin. Of course, the bacterial gel must be diluted with some kind of solvent when spraying, and then it can be sprayed. The germ-carrying insects are stored in tin containers, but the two ends of the container are open, covered with a piece of cloth or wire mesh to allow the insects to breathe.
    According to the captain, the total capacity of the airplane's germ box is probably about seven thousand insects, or one hundred pounds of bacterial gel, of course, this is diluted before being loaded in, that is, one hundred pounds of bacterial gel plus solvent can be loaded. The diameter of the tube for spraying bacteria or insects is about three inches and fifteen to twenty feet long. In order to spray the bacteria out, the end of the tube is equipped with a nozzle, just like the nozzle of a watering can in a garden. Of course, when spraying insects, this nozzle needs to be removed so that the insects can be sprayed freely. Above the nozzle – that is, at the end of the tube, a safety cover is installed. When the plane does not need to spray, the safety cover is closed to prevent the pilot from contaminating the airport during takeoff or landing.
    This sprayer is controlled and managed by the pilot himself in the cockpit. When starting to spray, whether spraying bacteria or germ-carrying insects, the pilot only needs to push a control stick, the bacteria or insect can will open automatically, and at the same time the small door from the large germ box to the spraying tube will also open, and the safety cover at the end of the spraying tube will also open. The captain instructed us on the method of spraying. When spraying insects, the flight speed must be around 200 miles per hour, which is the minimum speed for the plane to fly at low altitude. The flying altitude for spraying insects should be between 500 feet and 1,000 feet. Bacteria can be sprayed at a higher speed. At the same height, that is, 500 to 1,000 feet from the ground, it can be sprayed at a speed of 350 miles per hour. Of course, after the pilot finishes spraying, he has to pull the control stick back to close the safety cover at the end of the spraying tube, so that the insects or bacteria that have not yet been sprayed out are closed in the tube, so as not to contaminate his own airport during landing.
    For safety reasons, at the K-46 base, a spraying truck equipped with a sprayer is usually prepared. It follows the plane and sprays disinfectant on the ground. In other words, after the plane that has carried out the mission of spraying bacteria flies back and lands, when it taxis towards the parking area, the spraying truck will follow the plane closely, spraying the ground behind it as a preventive measure to ensure the safety of the base. The plane itself is sent to the parking area, where a special disinfection team disinfects the plane. The pilot himself immediately takes off his flight suit and takes it for disinfection. He himself immediately takes a hot shower to prevent any accidents.
    According to Captain McLaughlin, there were a total of four airplanes at K-46 base that were equipped with the equipment for spraying bacteria or germ-carrying insects. These airplanes were not parked together with other ordinary airplanes, they were parked at the north end of the airport. I personally saw these airplanes taxi past on the airport. Each of these spraying airplanes was equipped with a special group of personnel who were specifically responsible for taking care of the spraying equipment on the airplane. There was also another group of special personnel at the airport. All the work of loading, transporting, etc. of all bacterial weapons was done by these personnel. They were under the jurisdiction of the base's ordnance department. These special personnel loaded germ bombs onto the airplanes. Some special personnel were responsible for the work of putting bacterial containers into the germ boxes. They take care of everything related to the use of bacterial weapons.
    And: What does K-46 mean?
    O'N: Perhaps I should interrupt the topic temporarily here, because a member of the committee asked me what K-46 means. K-46 is the code name of a forward base of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. K-46 is probably located about five miles north of Wonju in South Korea.
    Need: Someone suggested taking a break for five to ten minutes. I don't know if you have finished talking about Captain McLaughlin's lecture. Should we continue talking and finish talking about this issue before taking a break?
    O'N: Well, I haven't completely finished talking yet, sir. It only takes a few more minutes to finish.
    Need: Okay, he says it only takes a few more minutes to finish. Then let's continue talking.
    O'N: Okay, sir. I stopped when I was talking about preventive measures, right? When Captain McLaughlin talked about this, he also told us that the situation he had just talked to us about was extremely secret intelligence, and we must not talk about it with others under any circumstances, not even among ourselves. He looked very serious when he said this. We knew that things were quite serious, so we all obeyed him. This class lasted two hours, with a ten-minute break in the middle for us to drink Coca-Cola.
    The captain did not bring any notes when lecturing. He may have prepared some notes during the break, but I don't believe he did this, because when we were drinking Coca-Cola, he stayed in the same room with us. Obviously, he was giving this class completely from memory. There is no doubt that if he had given these classes to every pilot, he could become very familiar with this issue. During the lecture, he drew diagrams of various germ bombs and spraying equipment on the blackboard to help explain. He also talked to us about the operational precautions we should take when carrying out bacteriological warfare missions. He told us not to look suspicious when we went to the airplane. He told us to pretend to be nonchalant, just like carrying out an ordinary mission. This was obviously to minimize the anxiety of the pilots when they knew they were going on a bacteriological warfare mission, because pilots usually went to the airplane in a group, chatting and joking, and joking with the leader, etc.
    Need: Anything else?
    O'N: No, sir. Furthermore, the class time was from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The briefing room was very small, so the number of people in the class naturally had to be limited. Perhaps all ten of us newcomers, that is, the ten people who arrived with me, except for me, there were nine people, had taken this class. Of course, if the class was held in the ordinary message room, then all ten of us could have taken the class together, but people were coming and going there all day long, so such a secret class certainly could not be taught there. Now I have finished talking.
    Need: I think we have been talking for a long time now, it should be time to take a break.
        (Ten-minute break)
    Need: Now, the meeting resumes. Does Mr. O'Neill have anything else to answer to Dr. Martel's questions, that is, about Captain McLaughlin's lecture? If there is nothing else, then I suggest that this issue be discussed to this point.
    O'N: I have finished talking about the lecture situation.
    And: I have a question that Mr. O'Neill may not be able to answer. When you heard about the contents of these containers and other things, did you ever think about where these things were manufactured? Is it really all manufactured in the United States and then transported so far away, going through various places along the way? If this is the case, it would take several weeks for these things to be transported to the front line. Did he indicate to you where all this preparation work was done?
    O'N: Regarding the issue of where these preparations were carried out, Major Williams said when he lectured at Luke that these tasks were carried out at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. I missed a part when I talked about Captain McLaughlin's lecture. According to him, germ bombs were transported by air, probably about once every two weeks. There was no large supply at the base. These germ bombs were transported according to the required quantity, so as not to be left for too long. From Maryland in the eastern United States to Korea, if air transport is used, it only takes a few days. It only takes two days to cross the Pacific Ocean. I can say that if germ bombs are transported all the way from Maryland, it will take no more than seventy-two hours to fly there. I don't know where else there are such experimental stations. Of course, it is also very possible that there are some such bases in Japan, because there is a lot of equipment left there from the last war.
    Need: Are there any more questions? Oh, go ahead.
    Oli: In your participation in meetings and classes, have you ever heard that they dropped diseased animals or ordinary animals from the air, such as mice, voles, and crabs, etc.?
    O'N: No, sir, I have not heard of the latter. They used mice and rotten things. These were cultivated at the same time as the insects required for the parachute-type germ bombs.
    Zh: Have they been vaccinated against several diseases?
    O'N: Do you mean have I been vaccinated?
    Zh: Have you been vaccinated against these diseases?
    O'N: Well, sir, I have not been vaccinated against all these diseases. Before leaving the United States at the embarkation port of Camp Stoneman, I was vaccinated against tetanus, typhoid, cholera, and smallpox. However, this was done a long time ago, when I first joined the Air Force. This was all to enhance the body's resistance. All personnel assigned to go abroad must do this. One lecturer said – I remember it was Major Williams, he said that for every type of bacteria they are preparing to use, they have cultivated an antitoxin. If any accidents occur, or if any of our troops are threatened by bacteria, they can be protected with this antitoxin. I myself have not been vaccinated against all the diseases that may be used.
    Interpreter: You mean, vaccinated against every type of bacteria used, right?
    O'N: Yes, sir. Also, bacteria that may be used.
    Besseau (Brazil, hereinafter referred to as Bes): Do you know what temperature these bombs should be stored at? Do they need to be refrigerated, or are they stored at ordinary temperatures?
    O'N: I don't know, sir. These bombs, germ bombs, and bacterial containers for spraying were all placed in a pile. At K-46 base, they were stored in a steel-concrete basement. When I was still there, I think there was no need for refrigeration. At that time, there was snow everywhere on the ground. The freezing line was still staying on the soil surface. It is difficult for me to say for sure whether they had refrigerators. There is no doubt that if those artificially cultivated cold-resistant bacteria and insects were transported to warm places, they would definitely need to be refrigerated.
    Need: If no one else has any questions now, I have one or two questions to ask. In fact, the main point is that I find it difficult to identify these containers. I don't really like to use the word bombs, because in my mind, bombs must have a large amount of explosives. But these only have a small amount of explosives, for some special purpose. But, anyway, these containers spread insects and bacteria. I also find it difficult to distinguish the bombs Mr. O'Neill described from the bombs we are familiar with. The main point now is: the leaflet bomb that we are familiar with has four containers. It is the same as the parachute bomb type B that Mr. O'Neill mentioned. Its containers are made of steel, metal, not cardboard. It also has some kind of timed fuse on its head, which splits into two halves in the air or on the ground. I think these things must be clarified.
    O'N: In other words, you want to know whether the dog parachute bomb and the leaflet bomb belong to the same category, right? Sir.
    Need: Yes, what is the relationship between the leaflet bomb and the bomb you just described?
    O'N: Sir, I don't know about this. I only heard about the leaflet bomb in class, which can drop leaflets and paper with bacteria on them. As for the dropping device, it was not taught, so I cannot answer your question, sir.
    Need: We have come to this issue, so I think, let me ask a question first. I want to ask... the second thing, the two types of parachute bombs that Mr. O'Neill talked about are both metal. It seems that the type "A" bomb has a mechanism on its head that opens when it lands, similar to the leaflet bombs we have seen. But both of these are metal. There is also another type made of thick paper, like a flare, about that tall and that big in diameter (Needham gestures), with a parachute attached. This does not match either of the two containers he talked about. I don't know if he can provide some information on this issue.
    O'N: Sir, I cannot answer this question directly. I don't know what those containers you are talking about are. I talked to journalist Weinington, and he told me about that type of container. I had seen that kind of photo after I was captured. It was only at that time that I learned about this type of parachute germ bomb. The classes we took mainly focused on the aerial burst type, the non-parachute type, because the parachutes on the bombs in the lecture were all hung on the tail of the bomb, which is not suitable for fighter jets, because fighter jets carry bombs under the wings, which are exposed, so there is a risk of the parachute opening first and hitting the control device, causing the plane to become uncontrollable.
    Need: Following up on these questions, I would like to ask Mr. O'Neill what

    国际科学委员会委员们询问美国空军战俘奥尼尔笔录
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会委员们询问美国空军战俘奥尼尔笔录。文如下：
    译员：奥尼尔中尉，请告诉你的全名、军阶和地址。还有你曾在细菌战方面接到什么指示。
    奥：我的全名是弗洛依德·白利兰特·奥尼尔。我是美国空军后备队的一个中尉。军号A0—1848575。我家庭的通讯处是：南卡罗来纳州费尔法克斯城莫耶路邮箱六十六号。我在细菌战方面上过两堂课。第一课是一九五一年十二月一日在美国亚利桑那州费匿克斯城的卢克空军基地上的。这一课很简短，只上了三十分钟。第二课是在第十八战斗轰炸机大队的K—46朝鲜前进基地上的。时间是一九五二年一月二十二日。这一课谈到我们要使用的细菌武器，内容就完全得多了。这一课上了大概两个钟头。以后，我接到的其他唯一指示当然就是叫我执行细菌战任务的命令了。
    安德琳（瑞典，下简称安）：在你上课的时候，他们有没有很清楚地告诉你细菌战已经在进行中？
    奥：我对这问题的答复是：在卢克上第一课时，没有。在K—46上第二课时，是讲了的。
    马戴尔（法国，下简称马）：奥尼尔先生，你能够告诉我们上这两课的时候每次有多少驾驶员听讲吗？
    奥：可以，先生。在卢克空军基地上第一课的时候，大约有七十个学生听讲，也就是射击学校的全体学生。其中大约四十人是F—84战斗轰炸机中队的，大约三十人是F—51战斗轰炸机中队的。
    马：第二课呢？
    奥：上第二课的时候，只有我们四个人，是被派到第十八战斗轰炸机大队的十名新驾驶员中的四个。我们因为是新来的，所以要上课。
    马：照你的答复来说，那是不是可以认为：在这个基地，其他的驾驶员全都已经受过细菌战的训练呢？
    奥：是的，先生。在K—46基地，全部驾驶员先前都曾经受过细菌战的训练。
    马：在他们讲课的时候，是不是曾经多方找寻口实说明他们为什么要使用这种武器，还是直截了当地一开始就讲解种种技术方法呢？
    奥：他们没有作什么说明。上第一课的时候，他们意思是这样的……讲课的人说，讲这样一课的目的是为了给我们了解这方面的基本知识。另外没有谈到什么别的原因。在朝鲜这里上第二课的时候，他们根本没有谈到原因。讲课的人一开头就谈到使用细菌武器的方法。马：请谈谈你是怎样被俘的，好吗？
    奥：好的，先生。一九五二年三月四日，我奉命飞往北朝鲜新幕以西约十英里的地方切断铁路线。大约在九时十五分，我被高射炮火打中。我的飞机不能飞了，于是我便跳伞降落到一片稻田上，马上就被中国人民志愿军俘掳了。
    马：飞机里只有你一个人吗？
    奥：是的，先生，飞机里只有我一个人。
    这次出击另外还有两个人，但是飞机里只有我一个人。
    马：你曾经执行过几次细菌战的任务？
    奥：一次，先生。
    马：你的感想怎么样？你执行那次细菌战任务的时候是怎样一种心情？
    奥：老实说，我一生从来不曾那样紧张过。我还觉得，那次出击并不是什么寻常的任务，而更像一次葬仪。我从来不想参加细菌战，要想形容那时的心情，是很难的。我想，你们一定要说，我那样照着别人的吩咐干了这种事，真是够怯懦的了。我当时心里的确有这种念头。这些念头在我的心的深处，你们可以说，我像吞食苦药丸一样，硬把这种想头压下去。我尽量不想到这件事。
    马：也许你那时会极力抑压这方面的想法，可是你大概总会想到家乡你自己的家庭吧，假如这样一种武器有一天落到你的家属的头上。你该是怎样想法？
    奥：是的，先生。这一方面我想得很多。这是我经历中最恐怖的事情，我当时知道我所干的是破坏一切人道规章的卑鄙勾当。当然，最使我害怕的还是想到：假如这样的灾难一旦落到我的家庭，该是多么可怕的事情。
    李约瑟（英国，下简称李）：马戴尔博士说，他觉得他提的问题已经够多了，他愿意让别的人去提问题，但是他愿意以后再询问某些技术上的问题。
    李：趁现在大家还没有提出问题的时候，我愿意谈一谈遗漏掉的某些问题，并想就国际法和战争惯例方面提一个问题。我在本委员会的前几次会议上就已经说过，按我的印象，好像在英国军队里他们有什么英皇规章和陆军规则，里面有某几条提到公认的战争惯例，如不杀害俘虏或其他类似的事情。我不晓得，奥尼尔先生是不是曾经在美国空军须知里看到过有关战争公约、战俘待遇等等事情的解释，那里面是不是有关于细菌战的规定，如果有的话，他是不是曾经想到过他有可能以法律根据拒绝执行进行细菌战的命令。我以为，这是很重要也是很有意思的一点，这是应该加以调查，要弄明白的。
    奥：没有，先生。我在后备军官训练队受训时，在空军服役当中，曾经研读过许多军规，可是我从来不曾碰到过有什么条文谈到这类事情，就是说关于禁止任何武器或谈到战争的人道原则的事情。只是在我被击落之后，当然就是说被俘掳之后，我才看到了明文禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书。我以前从来不曾听说过这样一个议定书。
    欧利佛（意大利，下简称欧）：你提出了关于细菌战的供词，你现在对我们所谈的和在另外的会议上你所谈过的，你提供这些供词是什么原因促成的呢？
    奥：首先，我觉得我应该说明，我提出这样的供词，完全是出于自愿的。我没有受到肉体上或精神的压力，如果说我受到什么精神痛苦的话，那就是我为我自己的行为而感到的内心痛苦。毫无疑问，这种痛苦并不是别人给我的。这是我自作自受。因为我实际上参加了细菌战。因此，我觉得，我应该说，我的理智和灵魂或者我的心灵驱使我说，不管你们把这叫什么，总之这是我内心的某种压抑着的东西，我心里紧张得就像一个上紧的钟表的弦，可是忽然之间它松开了。我非说出来不行。正是因为我所做成的那些可怖的事情、那些痛苦，我才不能不说出来。我现在想，那种认识过程是我所经历过的最痛苦的时期。智力的发展——如果可以这样说的话——认识到我给人民造成了怎样的恐怖和破坏，给他们带来了怎样的痛苦。我自己也觉得，应该让全世界都知道朝鲜这里关于细菌战的情形，应该让人人都知道事情的真相，应该告诉全世界：美国军队怎样对无辜的人民使用这种武器。这种认识，使我更加决心要把事情说出来。可以说，在我没有说出我的供词以前，我的良心是被锁起来了。以后，在我感觉到我真诚愿意人人都知道这种不人道的战争之后，我就提出了我的供词。我要站在全世界之前，要帮助他们痛打那些主张使用这种武器的人。
    欧：你在提出供词的时候，是不是认为这样做会有助于揭露细菌战的事实？
    奥：是的，先生，我当时认为是这样的。我认为，一个曾经参与细菌战、曾经干了这种事的人，所说的话最低限度可以产生一些力量，让人人都知道这件事。
    茹科夫—维勒斯尼科夫（苏联，下简称茹）：你的同伴们在知道了美国军队在朝鲜进行细菌战之后，有些什么反应，你是不是可以谈一谈？
    奥：唔，先生，我只能描写一下和我一同上第二课的另外三位驾驶员的感想。因为我只从他们三人身上注意到他们在知道美国军队正在朝鲜进行细菌战之后马上的反应。在他们和我几个人当中，我想当时最主要的想法是一种恐怖和憎恶的情绪。当然，我们当时也很感觉惊异。那就是……我以前说过，我觉得我正在去参加别的什么人的葬仪。我们当时被告诫说，我们不得谈论这件事，就是我们这些人中间也不能谈论。因此，当我们下课以后，因为刚被叮咛不要谈论，我们大家谁也没有说什么。我们四个人可以说是吃惊到说不出话来。我知道，我当时觉得很奇怪：和平谈判正在开城进行，战争实际上已经停止的时候，我们为什么要在朝鲜使用细菌武器呢？别人有什么想法，我很难说，我只能根据他们脸上的表情和他们的行动来判断。
    这便是我们最初知道细菌战的时候，我观察到的反应。当然，后来的反应就完全不同了。根据我们的观察，别的驾驶员那一个曾经刚刚执行过细菌战的任务，我都看得出来——他们一个个都是失魂落魄的样子。他们非常阴郁。他们那样沉默，就要叫人怀疑，因为平常驾驶员们整天都是很爱谈话的，他们彼此交谈他们做过的事，说新的笑话，谈家里的消息等等。但是，那些刚刚执行细菌战任务的人都是阴郁得可怕。晚上，常常可以在俱乐部里看到他们拼命喝酒解愁。
    安：我很愿意知道你执行细菌战任务的日期和地点。
    奥：我执行第一次也是唯一的一次细菌战任务是在今年，一九五二年，二月十五日。我们的目标是北朝鲜的市边镇。这一次飞行我们共有四个人，每人带两个细菌弹，总共就是八个。我们不晓得那里面是那一类细菌——我们只知道那是细菌弹。
    译员：你说这些炸弹里有细菌，是吗？
    奥：是的，细菌弹，但是我不晓得那里面有那一类细菌。
    李：好了，我们以后还可以回头谈谈一般性的事情，现在我们可以谈技术性的问题。我希望知道，奥尼尔先生在听课当中，是否听到讲课人说脑炎是他们可能撒布的一种疾病。当然，普通病菌自然是有的，诸如霍乱、伤寒、鼠疫等等，但我不知道他们是否提到过脑炎。
    奥：没有，先生，他们没有提到。他们只提到你刚才所谈那些一般的疾病。其他别的什么都没有提到。然而，我不能说完全没有撒布脑炎的可能性，因为他们进行的工作是非常多的。
    欧：在那两堂课上，他们只是谈到用飞机进行细菌战吗？他们是否也谈使用大炮的可能——就是说用炮弹把细菌打出去。
    奥：对的，先生。在第一堂课上，他们谈到这点，他们说细菌武器也可以装在炮弹中使用。讲课人只是说到，有各种类型的细菌可以装在炮弹里使用，此外再也没有说什么了，他不过解释一下说，大炮的射程有限，而飞机则可以把细菌弹投到远得多的地方去。
    李：奥尼尔先生是否可以跟我们谈一谈昆虫容器方面的事情，他们在容器方面说过些什么？例如，他们谈过自动销毁的容器吗？不论是能够破裂成大量小破片的那种容器，或者是那些用某种像纸一样的材料造成能够自动起火焚毁的容器。
    奥：不，先生。他们没有提过这种自动销毁的武器。第一课只是概论式的讲课，只谈到这方面的一般性问题。在第二课上，关于细菌战的武器，也仅只谈到美国军队当时使用的各种炸弹。当时也谈到传染过细菌的树叶和纸张，这就是除了细菌弹和细菌炮弹之外还提到的唯一其他武器。
    李：我还想继续这个问题，我想要知道，课上谈到散布物件、细菌或别的什么东西时，谈到要使用那一种类的容器，那一种类的炸弹呢？
    马：你是否能谈一谈你上那两课的内容。
    奥：可以，先生。在卢克空军基地上的第一课，多少是对细菌战的一般的概括的叙述。课上没有提到要在什么地方进行细菌战。讲课人一开始就告诉我们说，讲课内容是秘密的。他接着便谈到，细菌战可以用两种方式进行：一种是用大炮发射，另一种是由飞机投掷炸弹。他指出这两种投掷细菌或带菌昆虫的方式各有长短，他指出大炮的射程有限，而细菌炸弹则可以投到敌人战线深远的后方去。在这一课上，我们也知道了，美国军队和美国研究细菌战的科学机关正在研究细菌战，他们正在研究能在寒冷气候使用的特种细菌和昆虫，并已经培养出这种细菌和昆虫。讲课人告诉我们说，细菌须经过一种培育手续，使它可以抗御寒冷，他把那种手续称为气候适应过程，那就是说使细菌处在一种逐渐一点一点地降低的温度和湿度中。当它们习惯了新的温度以后，那时就把温度再降低。这样，细菌便能逐渐适应于愈来愈冷的气候。
    讲课人也提到说，他们也培育了耐寒的昆虫。这种昆虫是用杂交的方法培育出来的，就是把一种具有所需要的传染疾病的特性的昆虫和另一种同类的耐寒昆虫交配。这些杂交所产生的后代又再和耐寒的昆虫交配，这样就可以逐渐得到一种能在寒冷气候下生活的昆虫。这种昆虫既有所需要的传染疾病的特性，也能习惯于寒冷的气候。
    在卢克上的第一课，内容大概就是这样。讲课人是一位空军少校培特尔·W·威廉士。把他向我们介绍的军官说，他是特地从华盛顿来给我们讲这一课的。这位少校说，这些培育耐寒细菌和昆虫的工作和研究，是在马里兰州亚伯丁试验场的专门机构里进行的。化学兵团和陆军军械处在亚伯丁设有许多实验室。在亚伯丁工作的人，有军役人员，就是陆军中各方面的专家，也有为政府工作的文职的科学工作人员。当然，当他们自己的研究工作者碰到困难的时候，政府还有全国的第一流科学家可供咨询。
    我们在K—46基地上的第二课，一般是讲威廉士少校没有讲到的地方。我以前就说过，第二课是在
    一月二十二日上的。讲课人是一位麦克拉夫林上尉，第十八战斗轰炸机大队的情报官员。我不晓得他的名字的缩写，我只知道他叫“麦克上尉”，人人都是这样叫他的。他年纪大约三十岁，身长在五呎十吋以上，黑头发，已经开始变灰。我们四个人，彼特·尼百来、杰姆·何尔司利、格雷也尔和我，奉召到大队作战处去，有一个人来通知我们说，麦克拉夫林上尉要见我们。上尉把我们领到大队作战处那所房屋靠后面的一个小汇报室里。这间房子小得很，里面放有一张桌子，我相信摆着六张椅子。在房间的一端墙壁上挂着一面小小的黑板。
        上尉开始时先向我们说，虽然我们的通常的出击任务都是要保守秘密的，但我们彼此之间仍然可以谈论。然而，他跟着告诉我们说，他马上要给我们讲的事情、他要谈的问题是极端秘密的。在空军里——美国空军里，极端秘密就是军事情报中最机密的一级。他一连好几次向我们强调这一点，强调指出这是最高秘密，接着他开始向我们谈细菌战的技术以及种种技术方面的问题。他说，就空军来说，进行细菌战有两种办法——就是说一般有两种类型的炸弹。一种是空中爆炸炸弹，就是说炸弹在落下时在空中就爆炸了。这种炸弹是用来装细菌的，里面不能装昆虫。第二种是降落伞炸弹，要用降落伞来投掷的。这种炸弹用来装带有病菌的昆虫。当然，除了炸弹之外，还有昆虫——带有病菌的昆虫，或者细菌，都可以从飞机直接喷射下去。
    译员：你说喷射法，是不是说昆虫可以喷射，细菌也可以喷射，两种都可以？
        奥：是的，先生，两种都可以。上尉谈到这里时提到，我们的大队——就是第十八战斗轰炸机大队——只使用空中爆裂式的细菌炸弹，并且也执行直接喷射的任务。那个时候，我们没有使用带降落伞的细菌炸弹。只装细菌的空中爆裂式细菌炸弹外貌和大小都跟普通的五百磅炸弹差不多，弹身大约三呎长，直径约一呎半，只不过没有普通五百磅炸弹那么重，它的重量大概是一百五十磅到两百磅。这种炸弹的外壳非常薄，只有四分之一吋。
    这种空中爆裂式炸弹里面大约装有一百磅胶状物，这是繁殖细菌的培养基。弹头装有信管，紧贴着后面有一点点炸药。炸药并不太多，仅仅足以把细菌散布开来，落在一片地区内。信管本身安装在炸弹头里。这种信管就是一般所谓定时信管，或者叫作空中爆炸信管。就是说，它使炸弹大约在距地面五十呎到一百呎的空中爆炸。这是一种雷达控制的信管，按雷达的原则发生作用，弹头的信管部分的确安装有一个小型无线电控制器，这种信管可以调节好在离地面一定的距离爆炸。当炸弹落到一定的高度的时候，便爆炸，并把细菌散布开来。
    上尉讲到的另外一种炸弹便是降落伞型炸弹，这种炸弹是用来投掷带菌昆虫的。降落伞型炸弹就是用降落伞来投掷的炸弹，这一种炸弹通常可以分为两种。第一种只带一种昆虫，换一句话说，它只不过……炸弹里装的昆虫全是一种品种的昆虫。这种炸弹的弹头有某种机械装置，在炸弹碰到地面时，弹身就自动地裂成两半，让里面的昆虫跑出来。这种炸弹和别的细菌炸弹一样大小，三呎长，一呎半宽，外壳很薄，仅为四分之一吋，重一百五十至两百磅。
    李：唔。
    奥：打开炸弹——也就是说让炸弹裂开——的装置包括弹头的一个电钮。在炸弹碰到地面的时候，和地面的冲击使弹内的电路接通。这个电钮联结在一个电池和一个小马达上。小马达动起来的时候，就使那个把炸弹合在一起、就是把炸弹的两半合在一起的门闩拉了开来。这个门闩松开之后，炸弹便裂了开来，里面的昆虫就会爬出来。
    第二种降落伞炸弹专用来在一个炸弹内投掷好几种昆虫。假如我没有记错，上尉在图解中说，这样一个炸弹可以同时装蚊子、蚊蚋、蜘蛛和苍蝇几样昆虫。这种炸弹和其他炸弹同样大小，三呎长，一呎半宽。这种炸弹里面分为四部分。每一部分之间有一片厚纸板或硬纸，把里面的昆虫隔离开来。这样隔开是很必要的，特别是要把蜘蛛隔开，要不然蜘蛛跑到别的部分里，就会把别的昆虫都弄死的。炸弹着地后，这里面的昆虫也像上面一种炸弹的情形一样逃逸出来，唯一不同的就是这种炸弹并不裂成两半。这种炸弹的每格都有一个小门，而打开这个门的机关和第一类型炸弹一样的，就是说电钮先开动小马达，小马达打开了每一格的门，带菌的昆虫便跑了出来。
    在这两型降落伞炸弹中，降落伞都系在炸弹尾上，就是弹头对过的一端。在炸弹碰着地面之后，电钮使电路接通，在分裂型的炸弹来说是把门闩拔掉，在另一型炸弹来说是把各格的小门打开，而在这同时，把降落伞和炸弹连结起来的一根针也拔掉了，这样降落伞或者就是被风吹掉，或者就是脱开掉在一边。假如没有这种装置，当然降落伞就有可能落在炸弹上，把昆虫都罩住，那么昆虫就失去作用了。
    上尉以后跟着谈到从飞机喷射细菌或带菌昆虫的方法。喷射器械装在飞机的尾部，在驾驶员后面。因为有了这种喷射器械，飞机内部得费一番特别的工作。飞机都得特别改装一下才能装上这个喷射器械。就一般飞机来说，普通驾驶座后面都装有一个机身汽油箱。这种汽油箱得拆卸下来，在这个位置上装上喷射器。这种器械的主要部分当然便是装细菌和昆虫的箱子或容器。细菌或昆虫经过一根细管，从箱子一直通到机尾，就在飞机尾部喷射出去。
    这个装在飞机内部的箱子大约三呎高，两呎宽。细菌或带菌昆虫都是装在容器（一个罐子）里拿来的。罐子里的细菌或昆虫便用管子送到飞机的箱子或容器里去。细菌是装在罐子里拿来的，换一句话说，整个容器都是用锡制成的。当然，细菌胶状物在喷射的时候，先得用某种溶剂稀释，而后才能喷射。带菌昆虫则装在锡制的容器里，但是容器的两端开着口，蒙着一片布或者铁丝网，以便昆虫呼吸。
    据上尉说，飞机细菌箱的容量总计大概可以装七千只昆虫，或者装一百磅细菌胶状物，当然这要稀释了才装进去的，也就是说可以装一百磅细菌胶状物加上溶剂。喷射细菌或昆虫的管直径大约三吋，长十五呎至二十呎。为了使细菌能够喷射出去，管的末端装着一个喷嘴，恰恰和花园里用那种喷水龙头的喷嘴一样。当然，如果在喷射昆虫的时候，这个喷嘴需要拿掉，以使昆虫能够自由地喷射出去。喷嘴上面——就是在管子的末端，安装有一个安全盖，当飞机不需要喷射的时候，安全盖就关上，以免驾驶员在起飞或着陆的时候使机场受到传染。
    这个喷射器是由驾驶员在座舱里自己操纵管理的。在开始要喷射的时候，无论是喷射细菌或是带菌昆虫，驾驶员只要推一下操纵杆，细菌或昆虫罐子便自己打开，同时大细菌箱通喷射管的小门也打开了，喷射管末端的安全盖也打开了。上尉指示我们喷射的方法。喷射昆虫时，飞行速度得在每小时两百哩左右，这是飞机在低空飞行的最低速度了。喷射昆虫的飞行高度要在五百呎到一千呎之间。细菌的喷射可以用较高的速度。在同样的高度，就是距地面五百至一千呎，可以用每小时三百五十哩的速度来喷射。当然，当驾驶员喷射完毕之后，他得把操纵杆拉回来，使喷射管末端的安全盖关上，使那些还没有喷射出去的昆虫或细菌关闭在管内，以便着陆时不至使自己的机场受到传染。
    为了安全起见，在K—46基地那里，平时备有一部喷射卡车，装有喷射器，它跟在飞机后面向地面上喷射消毒水。换一句话说，飞机执行喷射细菌任务飞回着陆之后，向着停机场滑行过去的时候，喷射卡车便紧紧地跟着飞机跑，在它后面喷射地面，以便作为保障基地安全的预防措施。飞机本身则被送到停机地区，在那里有专门消毒小组对飞机进行消毒。驾驶员自己则马上脱掉他的飞行衣，拿去消毒。他自己则马上去洗一次热水喷水浴，以防万一。
    据麦克拉夫林上尉说，在K—46基地，共有四架飞机装设有喷射细菌或带菌昆虫的设备。这些飞机和别的普通飞机不停放在一起，它们停放在飞机场的北端。我亲自看见过这些飞机在机场上滑行过去。这些喷射飞机每一架都配备有专门的一组人员，专门照管机上的喷射装置。另外机场上还有另一组专门人员。一切细菌武器的装机、搬运等工作全都由这些人员来做。他们是隶属于基地军械部门之下的。这些特殊人员为飞机装细菌炸弹。一些特殊人员负责把细菌容器放到细菌箱内的工作。他们照管一切有关细菌武器的使用事宜。
    安：K—46是什么意思？
    奥：也许我这里要把话题暂时中断一下，因为委员会的一位委员问我，K—46是什么意思。K—46是第十八战斗轰炸机大队一个前进基地的代号。K—46大概位于南朝鲜原州以北约五哩。
    李：有人提议休息五分钟到十分钟，我不知道你是不是已经谈完了麦克拉夫林上尉讲课的情形，我们是不是应该继续谈下去，把这问题谈完，然后才休息呢？
    奥：唔，我还没有完全谈完呢，先生。只需要几分钟时间就可以结束了。
    李：好，他说再有几分钟就可以结束。那么继续谈下去吧。
    奥：好的，先生。我刚才是谈到预防措施的时候停下来的吧。麦克拉夫林上尉讲到这里的时候又告诉我们说，他刚才跟我们谈的情形都是极端秘密的情报，我们无论如何决不能与别人谈论，就是我们自己之间也不能谈论。他说这话的时候脸色非常严厉。我们知道，事情相当严重，因此我们都服从他的话。这一课讲了两个钟头，当中休息十分钟，让我们喝可口可乐。
    上尉讲课时完全没有带笔记。他可能在休息的时候准备了一点笔记，但是我相信他没有这样做，因为当我们喝可口可乐的时候，他和我们留在一个房间里。显然，他完全凭着记忆讲这一课的。毫无疑问，假如他跟每一个驾驶员都讲过这些课，他对这问题是可以弄得很熟的。他在讲课当中，在黑板上绘出各种细菌炸弹和喷射器械的图形，帮助讲解。他并且向我们谈了我们在执行细菌战任务时行动上应该注意的事项。他告诉我们，我们去上飞机时，不要让人看出可疑的样子。他告诉我们，要装出若无其事的神气。就好像执行普通任务一样。这显然是为了尽量使驾驶员不至在知道他们出动执行细菌战任务的时候，显出紧张不安的情绪，因为驾驶员平时去上飞机的时候，总是一伙人大家有说有笑，和领队开开玩笑诸如此类的。
    李：还有什么吗？
    奥：没有了，先生。再有就是上课时间是从下午两点上到四点。上课的汇报室很小，因此上课的人数自然不得不受限制。也许，我们十个新来的人，那就是和我一起到的十个人，除了我之外是九个人，全都上过这一课。当然，如果在普通的传令室上课，那我们十个人全都可以在一起上，但是那里整天都有人进进出出，这样秘密的课程当然不能在那里讲授。现在我讲完了。
    李：我想，我们现在已经谈了很久了，应该是休息的时候了。
        （休息十分钟）
    李：现在，会议再次开始。奥尼尔先生对马戴尔博士的问题，就是说关于麦克拉夫林上尉讲课的情形，是不是还有什么需要答复的。如果再没有什么，那我建议这问题谈到这里为止吧。
    奥：讲课情形我已经谈完了。
    安：我有一个问题，也许奥尼尔先生不能答复。当你听说这种种容器的内容和其他种种事情时，你是不是想过这些东西都在那里制造的。难道这一切果真都是在美国制造好，而后全部那么老远地运过来，中途经过各个地方辗转运来的吗？要是这样，这些东西要运到前线，得经过好几个星期。他有没有向你表示过这一切准备工作在什么地方做的呢？
    奥：关于这些准备工作在那里进行的问题，在卢克上课时，那位威廉士少校说，这些工作是在马里兰州的亚伯丁试验场进行的。我在谈麦克拉夫林上尉讲的课时漏了一部分。据他说，细菌弹是空中运输来的，大概每两个星期左右运一次。基地里并没有大批供应。这些细菌弹都是按照需要数量运来，以免搁得过久。从美国东部的马里兰州到朝鲜，如果使用空运，不过是几天的事。横越太平洋只需要两天。我可以说，假如细菌弹从马里兰州一直运来，那用不了七十二小时就可以飞到。我不晓得别的什么地方还有这种实验站。当然，日本境内有一些这样的基地，也是非常可能的，因为上次大战留在那里的设备是很多的。
    李：还有什么问题吗？哦，说吧。
    欧：在你参加会议和上课当中，是不是听说过他们从空中投掷害病的动物或是普通动物，如老鼠、嚎、和螃蟹等等？
    奥：不，先生，后一种没听说过，他们使用的是老鼠和腐败的东西。这是和降落伞型细菌弹需用的昆虫同时培育的。
    茹：他们是不是对几种疾病进行过预防注射。
    奥：你意思说对我进行过注射吗？
    茹：你受过预防这几种疾病的注射吗？
    奥：唔，先生，并没有受过预防全部这些疾病的注射。我在离开美国的登船港口史东曼兵营以前，受过预防破伤风、伤寒、霍乱的注射和接种牛痘。可是，这是早就注射了的，还是在我刚参加空军的时候。这都是为了增强身体抵抗力。一切被派到国外去的人员都得这样，一位讲课人说过——我记得那是威廉士少校，他说，对于准备使用的每一种细菌，他们都培养出了一种抗毒素，如果发生任何意外事故，或者我们的任何部队受到细菌威胁，都可以用这种抗毒素保护。我本人并未受到预防全部可能使用的疾病的注射。
    译员：你是说，预防所使用的每一种细菌，是吗？
    奥：是的，先生。也是说可能使用的细菌。
    贝索亚（巴西，下简称贝）：你晓得不晓得这些炸弹要储藏在什么温度之下？是不是要冷藏起来，还是就藏在普通温度之下呢？
    奥：我不晓得，先生。这种炸弹，细菌炸弹和喷射用的细菌容器都搁在一堆，在K—46基地是藏在一个钢骨水泥的地下室里。当我还在那里的时候，我想毫无疑问是不需要冷藏的。那时地面上到处都是积雪。冻结线还是停留泥土表面。我很难确定地说他们是不是有冷藏机。毫无疑问，那些人工培育出来的耐寒细菌和昆虫如果运往温暖的地方，那一定是需要冷藏的。
    李：若是别人现在没有问题，我有一两个问题要提出来。其实真正主要之点，是我难于辨认这些容器。我不很喜欢用炸弹（bom bs）这个字，因为在我脑筋里炸弹必须有大量炸药的。而这些却只有少量炸药，是为了某种特殊用途的。但，不管怎样这些容器都散布昆虫和细菌。我也难于辨认奥尼尔先生所形容的炸弹与我们所熟习的炸弹的区别，现在的要点是：我们所熟习的传单炸弹就是有四个容器的。和奥尼尔先生所说的B型降落伞炸弹相同，它的容器是钢的，金属的而不是厚纸板制的。也是在头上有某种定时信管，在空中或着地时分裂成两半。我觉得必得把这些事情弄明白。
    奥：换句话说，你要知道多格降落伞炸弹和传单炸弹是否属于同一类，是不是？先生。
    李：是的，传单炸弹与你刚才所讲述的炸弹有什么关系？
    奥：先生，这个我不知道，只是在听课时，听过传单炸弹，可以把带有细菌的传单和纸投掷下去。至于投掷的装置，并没有讲授，我不能答复你这个问题，先生。
    李：我们谈到这个问题上来了，那么我想，让我先问一个问题，我要问……第二件事情，奥尼尔先生所讲的两种降落伞炸弹都是金属的。好像“A”型的炸弹有一个机关在头上，着地时打开，与我们曾经见过的传单炸弹相像。但这两种都是金属的，另外还有一种是用厚纸做的好像是一个照明弹，大概那样高、有那样大的直径（李约瑟作手势）附有一个降落伞。这和他所谈到过的那两种容器都不符合，我不知道他是否可以对这个问题提供一些材料。
    奥：先生，我不能直接答复这个问题。你所谈的那些容器不知道是什么东西。我向记者魏宁顿先生谈过，他告诉过我那类容器，在我被俘以后我曾看过那种照片。只是在那个时候我才知道这种型式的降落伞细菌炸弹。我们听的课主要是注重空中爆炸的那种型式，非降落伞型的，因为在讲课时炸弹上的降落伞都是挂在炸弹的尾上的，并不适用于战斗机，因为战斗机是在翼底装炸弹的，是露在外面的，因此有使降落伞先行张开，如果碰在操纵装置上面，就会有使飞机操纵不灵的危险。
    李：接着上面这些问题，我请问奥尼尔先生自己执行任务时用的是那类炸弹呢？记得在二月十五日那次的炸弹吗？他们是战斗轰炸机大队，或许是载在翅膀下面，但是如果办得到的话我想弄确实。
    奥：是的，先生。炸弹是载在翼下的，很难描述它们的形状，只能说出它的体积，这我以前已经说过了。只有从油漆上来辨认细菌弹或非细菌弹。普通用来轰炸或摧毁用的炸弹，即是说非细菌弹是陈旧的，前次大战所剩下来的。可是我执行任务那天自己并未检查炸弹，我不知为什么，我想我是能够不看那些炸弹我就不想看的。我只检查弹头信管和保险丝是否妥当以免发生意外的爆炸，然后我就上了飞机。所以炸弹究竟是什么样子我不知道，我只能把它的体积、颜色和大概的大小告诉你们。
    译员：你说是什么颜色？
    奥：是橄榄灰绿色的，普通军队的绿色，普通炸弹的颜色是暗淡的，因为是去年就放在外面露起的。
    李：是两个五百磅的吗？
    奥：你的意思是指细菌弹吗？
    李：在你飞机上的那些炸弹。
    奥：是的，有两个，看起来好像是普通的五百磅炸弹，但根据讲课时所说的，一个是一百五十磅，另一个是两百磅。只看外表不可能分辨出来。
    贝：你看见过实际装着昆虫的炸弹或装喷射箱没有？
    奥：没有。据我所知，装置炸弹——我不知道在什么地方装的。我想是在亚伯丁或别的地方。我所看见的炸弹只是那天早晨在我们飞机上的炸弹，当我看见时，已经早就装好了。这些炸弹已由从军械处派来的特殊人员放置在翼上的。
    译员：喷射飞机的箱子是怎样装的？你看见过吗？
    奥：没有，我没有看见过。但是我知道他们有吊炼滑车把装有细菌或带菌昆虫的容器装上飞机。他们用吊炼滑车把容器吊起来放在喷射器上。
    马：你什么时候作证的？
    奥：六月十八日。
    马：你什么时候被俘的？
    奥：三月四日。
    马：为什么从你被俘到你决定出来作证距离这样长的时间？
    奥：不是的，三月四日我在新幕被俘，但到四月二十日才到达基地战俘营。因为审讯人员太忙，在五月下旬才开始我的审讯。在起初我不愿意承认我所做的事情。但后来我受不过我良心的谴责，我不得不把我所做的事承认出来。所以从开始讯问到我出来作证时间是很短的。
    李：我要接着马戴尔博士已经问了的问题。我要问，假使我没有弄错，奥尼尔先生，在起初就承认他并未受任何肉体的或精神的压力，我想知道我们是否可以弄清楚，弄清楚为什么他会渐渐觉得良心的谴责。我的意思是说，是否因为看见了朝鲜人民的简单朴实的生活和来到朝鲜帮助他们创造更好的生活的中国人民志愿军的诚实态度等等的缘故？
    奥：是的，这是很复杂的一件事情。这是我看见滥炸北朝鲜的城市和村庄以后的结果。我看见许多被轰炸的地方。从我被俘的地方到这里来的路上，我看见炸毁了的房屋、学校和看见公路上的炸弹坑。三月四日我被俘那夜，我就乘车经过这些地方，现在我的身上还有伤痕，是我们在路上时一架B—26飞机投弹把我炸伤的。我完全懂得了朝鲜人民所受的恐怖。在我们前面有一辆卡车，成了那架B—26机轰炸的主要目标。我能够总括成一句话来说，在这方面，中国人民志愿军的帮助确实是很大的。
    自我被俘以后受到很好的待遇，我并没有缺少任何东西，他们都可以解决。因为轰炸和扫射，他们的交通非常困难。为了把他们所能供给的东西给我们，他们的工作真是了不起，甚至于冒着生命的危险把东西输送到我们俘虏营来。在我受审讯期间，对我的照顾非常周到。我并没受到人身侮辱或属于这一类的事情。所有这些，而且我又亲自看见轰炸和扫射所造成的灾害之大，沿途我看得不少。我看见在路旁烧毁了的卡车、弹坑累累的公路、操场和田地，炸弹。我真不知道那些投弹的驾驶员究竟他们的目标是什么。
    马：奥尼尔中尉在你未加入空军以前，你在学校是学什么的？
    奥：我在大学时是学化学的。一九四八年六月在南卡罗来纳州，查理士登城的契塔特尔大学（Citadel College in Charleston, South Carolina）得到化学理科学士学位（B．S．in Chemistry），以后的两年，即到一九五零年六月，我在路易斯安那州，新奥尔良城的土仑大学研究院研究化学（The GraduateSchool of Tnlane University in New OrleansLouisiana）同时作助教，就是看试卷，指导实验等工作。一九五零年六月在土仑大学得着物理化学
    （Physical Chemistry）的硕士学位（Master's
    Degree）。
    安：以后你就加入了空军吗？为什么呢？为什么你必得参加空军呢？
    奥：在契塔特尔（Citadel）大学我参加了所谓后备军官训练队受训（The Reserve Officers Training
    Program，R．O．Г．C．）。我还未学完所规定的课程就算毕业了。我没有时间学完那些课程，他们的委任要我参军，一九五零年八月，我被征调服役。我不愿作我在后备军官训练队所学的军需官职务，我宁愿去受飞行训练。
    安：被征召的吗？
    奥：征调，征召，都是一样，被叫回到空军去，参加空军。
    欧：现在的问题是这样，你被迫着陆时，你是否带有细菌弹，你是否必得把他们遮蔽起来？
    奥：不，我那天的任务是截断铁路，轰炸一条铁路线，俯冲轰炸一条铁路线。
    李：我们可以问这样一个问题，你们是否有一般的指示，说明你们带有细菌弹而被迫着陆时应如何处理没有？
    奥：有，有这样的指示。若是我们的引擎发生障碍或出了其他的事故，我们就在轰炸线的南边，就是战线的南边投下所带的炸弹。若是我们带有细菌弹，又在一个没有人居住的地区，那么可以叫雷达站来确定一下或是用无线电与雷达站联络，确切指明我们投下细菌弹的地点。然后我们飞返K—46向大队作战处回报投掷细菌弹的地点，他们就派特殊的人员去处理那些细菌炸弹，使不致发生害处。他们如何处理那些炸弹，我就不知道了。若是我们是在敌人的地区内，那就立刻投下炸弹飞回基地。当然也得注意投掷炸弹的地点，靠近什么地方，若是投掷的地方不是原定的目的地，在汇报时就要报告这个地点。若是执行喷射细菌的任务时，发生故障或引擎出毛病不能动时，不管在什么地区都跳伞让飞机撞坏着火烧毁，因为飞机上的两百加仑汽油可以把机上的细菌或带菌昆虫都消灭掉。若在执行喷射细菌的任务，引擎发生障碍而我们可以就近降落友军的飞机场时，我们降落最近的友军机场，否则如果我们达不到一个飞机场，那么我们就要跳伞。
    李：还有问题吗？（没有人提问题）
    奥：若是各位先生能原谅我，我愿意再说几句话。我是参加细菌战的人，而各位先生是来调查细菌战的。我觉得能有这个机会向各位先生讲话，这是我的光荣而同时也是权利。各位先生完全明了我的情况，我要向各位先生作一个很特别的而且是最必需的请求，因为我知道你们是世界上和平事业及国际友好的最高法庭。你们是从世界上各个不同的国家不远千哩的途程来到这里调查细菌战的罪行。不久以后你们就要回到你们的国家去告诉那里的人民你们所了解和调查所得的情况。你们要告诉他们细菌战的可怕，因为这是他们必须知道的事情。但我现在在这里一定要特别请求英国和巴西的委员先生们，因为他们距离我的国家美国最近。为什么我要注意美国的人民？因为那是我自己的国家，我知道那里的情形。我知道那里的报纸和无线电的评论员处理新闻的态度。他们会歪曲事实，他们不报道事实。他们只把他们要人民知道的事情告诉人民。一般的老百姓是不知道在朝鲜和中国东北进行了细菌战的。使我最伤心最痛苦的事情是我现在在你们面前所呈诉的证词不是美国人人都可以听得到的。因此，我请求你们，因为你们能够通过你们的组织把这个事实比我传布得更宽广。通过你们就能够使全世界都知道在朝鲜战场上已经进行了细菌战的真情。通过你们能够使世界上几乎每个人都知道细菌战的可怕。但我不能停止在“几乎”这个字上，这个事情一定要世界上每一个人知道。这些事情，一定要向我的国家的每一个人说明，向每个人一再说明，反复向他们说明，直到他们每一个人都丝毫不怀疑在朝鲜进行了细菌战而且现在正在进行着细菌战，许多人死在这个武器下。美国政府知道这些事实。他们必定知道，他们发动了细菌战，他们决定进行细菌战。但是美国人民不知道，因为美国政府不要他们知道。一定要把他们唤醒过来，使他们知道，知道细菌战正在这里进行的事实。他们必定要知道这个真相，若是他们知道了真相就一定会像其他国家的人民一样起来反对可怕的细菌战。你们各位先生们当中有些是科学家、专家，在我未参军作战以前也开始走科学的道路。你们对于美国科学家利用新的科学方法来毁灭人类，利用科学来制造细菌弹，细菌武器，利用他们的知识，利用他们自己的手，亲自制造新武器来杀害人类有何感想？你们冒着生命的危险来到这里调查细菌战的罪恶，因为细菌战成了世界和平的又一个威胁。你们在这里并不安全，就是在这个房子里也不安全的。在这个国土上没有一个人，没有一处是安全的，任何时候飞机可以从蔚蓝的天空中俯冲下来轰炸扫射。我找不着足够的或是恰当的字眼来确切表达我的感情。因为我是社会必定要判罪的新型的战争罪犯。当我想着我的前途以及有一天我的儿子（虽然我还未结婚，但我有意思要结婚的），问我在朝鲜干些什么事情，我怎么能够告诉他我在这里向人民投掷细菌弹来进行毁灭、屠杀、破坏呢？我怎么能够在一个文明世界里有脸面回去见我的家人呢？我怎能告诉他们这些事情，说我在全人类的眼中是一个罪犯呢？他们是我的血肉。要真正用声音表达人的情感，是太困难了。我只能试一试，我只能告诉你们我内心感觉的一部分。
    我是参加了细菌战的。我曾亲自向北朝鲜人民投细菌弹。当我完全了解我所做的行为，了解了我所造成的痛苦和祸害，真使我灵魂碎裂。这就是我所以现在向你们申诉，因为你们可以把真理告诉每一个人，告诉全世界，揭发这种正在进行的恐怖行为，这种违反人道的罪行。我现在最关心的是使别人，首先使你们，通过你们再使全世界的人都能了解我的看法，对这种违反人道的罪行，与我有同样的看法。这就是我为什么要使你们明白把这里的情形告诉人民的迫切和必要。我请求你们马上采取行动吧。全世界亿万人民都在受威胁。这不是一件仅对付一国人民的地方事件，它是与全世界作对的。每一个活着的生命都受到细菌战的威胁。你我都知道，像这样的事件，一经开始，除非全世界人们都起来反对，是很难压制下去的。极少数人可以决定使用细菌弹来杀害很多的生命。你们现在已掌握了细菌战的证据；你们有我的供词。你们已经知道细菌战已在进行。请立刻就引用这些供词吧！不要让这些供词在档案中间积灰尘吧。请不要把这些报告归档作以后参考资料。请不要只告诉你们本国的人民。要告诉所有的人。我的名望太小，我只能告诉你们，经过你们，我的意见可以传播到世界各地。经过你们，我的意见可以传得更宽广得多。经过你们，我可以告诉每一个人。现在“几乎”每个人是不行的，必须告诉每一个人，告诉所有的人已在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的真相。告诉每一个人，告诉全世界，尤其要告诉美国人民，我把事实告诉他们，告诉他们细菌战的恐怖。它残害这里的人民，给世界莫大的痛苦。请务必要告诉他们，因为一旦他们能知道真情，他们也会起来永远制止它。你们的任务是光荣的。你们现在有力量来使全世界人民相信这里发生了什么事情。你们可以告诉他们，如果细菌战是制止了，就不会再有像我和我伙伴一样的罪犯了，他们干了这种勾当，被人类认为是一种新型的罪犯。如果战争停止了，一般说这当然要以朝鲜停战为条件，那么世界上和平又会重现。我个人也有了和平，我可以回家，像我谈过的去建立我的家庭。我不要我的孩子在受轰炸威胁的世界中成长。我要使他们成长在一个和平世界中，什么细菌战，细菌武器这些名词只能在历史书或者字典中找到，因为这些名词是只应该列在这些地方的。它们不属于我们的日常生活。在文明世界中我们是用不着它们的。这些是可怕的毁灭的武器。你们是看见这些武器被使用了。我祈求你们，去周告全世界人民你们所知道的一切吧。我相信经过你们的努力，这细菌战争是终于会被制止的。我们要有和平。我感谢诸位先生们给我时间讲话。如我所说，在诸位面前说话是一种很大的荣幸。我只希望对诸位小有帮助，只希望我能解决了一些诸位脑筋中的疑问。我希望我能给诸位一些启示。也许我的希望落空。可是您一定要明白这事态的紧急性，全世界都迫切需要知道这事件的真相。谢谢诸位。
    李：我想我该代表委员会向奥尼尔先生道谢，目下的情形本来是会使人情绪十分激动的，可是假如我们放任自己，那就会弄到我们大家都无法克制的地步，所以我们不能那么做，我们必须尽可能保持镇静。关于这点，我想奥尼尔先生是明了的，他原来是一个科学家，我们希望他将来还是一个科学家。现在奥尼尔先生可以全然不用顾虑到本委员会不去实现自己的，他所这样强调的任务。在我们手中已有多量的资料，我们相信这报告的内容和价值是不能够也不会像别的文件那样被人置之不理的。
    最使我感兴趣的是奥尼尔先生所讲到社会上对一种新式罪行的感觉。这是因为我对于这盲目滥施屠杀的战争武器的问题想过很久。我想大家都知道，这也就是今昔作战的不同处，在昔日兵士们成群拿着枪刀一块儿作战，可是今日这些兵士只须按一下开关就放出一些东西，丝毫不知道那是什么东西，或谁会因它而受到祸害，更不知有千千万万的人会因他按一下开关而受到祸害。按开关的战争的确是新鲜的东西，它对文化确是一种打击，我们可以想到奥尼尔先生在不得不做这种事时的一种心理和情绪上的焦虑和痛苦。我个人曾想得不少，可是从来没有处于一个必须接受命令去做那种事情的遭遇。我除在第一次大战时当过中尉军医以外别无其他经验。我也从未想到要我来做宣读赦罪书的事情，也许事实不是如此，因为我想在这里宣告赦罪已经由奥尼尔先生自己完成了，他已坚决地把他所知道的事实与他的信念都向我们说出来了，用他和我们以及一切有关人士所必须作的行动是可以拯救世界的。    （新华社）
