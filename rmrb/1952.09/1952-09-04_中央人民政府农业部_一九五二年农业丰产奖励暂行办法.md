Interim Measures for Agricultural 丰产(bumper harvest) Awards in 1952

II. The targets of the awards include counties, districts, townships (villages) that have achieved overall production increases in this year's patriotic 丰产 (bumper harvest) campaign, state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers who have achieved overall production increases or high yields, as well as model units and model workers leading production.

III. In addition to overall production increases, the reward crops are temporarily limited to rice, wheat, cotton, millet, corn, soybeans, and tubers (sweet potatoes, potatoes). For crops and special products not listed above, the Greater Administrative Area and the Provincial People's Government shall reward them on their own. Those with particularly significant achievements may also be reported to the Ministry for rewards.

IV. Award criteria:

	1. Counties, districts, townships (villages), state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams that have achieved significant overall production increases, have organized effectively, improved technology, and have made special achievements in fighting natural disasters.
	2. State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams whose average yield of all sown areas of one major crop exceeds the local level by more than 50% and is not lower than 60% of the local high-yield standard for that crop.
	3. State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers who have reached the high-yield standard on a specified area.
	4. State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers whose yield on a specified area exceeds the national record of 1951.
	5. People's governments at all levels, people's organizations, and rural workers who have made significant achievements in leading the patriotic production increase campaign.

	State-owned farms receiving awards must be able to complete the construction and production tasks assigned by the state.
	Those who receive high-yield awards and new record awards must have an average yield on land outside the awarded area that is higher than the local level.
	Units that achieve overall production increases, as well as model leading units and model workers, shall be evaluated by the People's Government above the provincial level, and those with particularly outstanding achievements shall be reported to the Ministry for awards.
	The yield standards and awarded areas for each award are shown in Annex Tables (1) and (2).

V. Those who have made significant achievements in developing animal husbandry and aquaculture should be rewarded. Specific measures will be formulated separately.

VI. Award recipients must love the motherland and maintain close ties with the masses.

VII. The achievements of all award recipients must be recognized by the local farmers. The Greater Administrative Area and the Provincial People's Government shall verify the facts before granting the award.

VIII. Prizes are divided into: (1) medals, certificates, and banners; (2) bonuses. Model leading units, counties, districts, and townships (villages) that achieve overall production increases, and individuals who achieve high yields will only receive honorary awards. State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, model workers, and individuals who receive new record awards may receive bonuses in addition to honorary awards.

IX. People's governments at all levels should pay attention to investigation and research, and actively cultivate and discover 丰产 (bumper harvest) targets and model leading units and model workers. When crops are harvested, personnel must be sent to conduct on-site investigations of 丰产 (bumper harvest) achievements, accurately measure area and yield, make summaries, organize detailed materials according to the prescribed forms, and submit them for review at each level, and the Ministry will make the final review and award.
