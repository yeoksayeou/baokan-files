Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 12th: The fiercest fighting in recent days has occurred in the Kimhwa southeastern area of the central front. On the evening of the 6th, a unit of our army, with the support of intense artillery fire, attacked an enemy-held hilltop position southeast of Jwasu-dong. After only five minutes of combat, our army captured the position, completely annihilating two platoons of the defending ROK army. Simultaneously, another unit of our army counterattacked an enemy position northeast of Gyoryam-san, completely wiping out one enemy platoon. In the following days, the enemy continuously counterattacked these two hilltops. From the 7th to the 10th, the enemy used a total force of over one regiment, launching more than thirty attacks. However, under the intense artillery bombardment and tight gunfire of our army, each enemy attack was met with failure. During the fighting, the enemy sometimes climbed onto the hilltops, but was quickly and bravely repelled by our counterattacking forces. In these five consecutive days of battle, our army has inflicted over a thousand casualties on the enemy.

In other areas of the front, our army also counterattacked the continuously advancing enemy, inflicting many casualties. On the 4th, our army on the western front counterattacked an enemy position northwest of Gonangpo, eliminating over eighty American soldiers. On the 6th, on the eastern front, a crack raiding team of a unit of our army, with artillery support, seized an enemy position east of Mundung-ri and continuously repelled nineteen counterattacks by enemy forces ranging from a platoon to a company, inflicting a total of over two hundred and thirty casualties on American soldiers. On the same day, our army counterattacked an enemy position southwest of Jangdan, eliminating over fifty enemy soldiers.

The powerful Korean and Chinese People's Naval Defense Forces repelled a landing attempt by a group of enemy troops southwest of Dancheon on the Haeju Peninsula on the west coast on the morning of the 10th.

The Korean and Chinese People's Artillery Forces continued to strike the enemy with intense artillery fire. According to incomplete statistics from the 6th to the 10th, our front-line artillery fire inflicted over one thousand five hundred casualties on the enemy, and destroyed or damaged eight enemy tanks and sixteen vehicles. In these five days, our front-line units shot down or damaged thirty-eight enemy aircraft.

    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】最近几天内最激烈的战斗发生在中部战线金城东南地区。六日傍晚，我军某部在猛烈炮火的配合下袭击座首洞东南敌军的一个山头阵地，仅仅经过五分钟的战斗，我军即将这一阵地占领，全歼守敌李伪军两个排。与此同时，我军另部反击轿岩山东北的一个敌军阵地，全歼敌军一个排。此后几天中，敌军不断向这两处山头进行反扑；自七日至十日，敌军使用兵力总计达一个团以上，攻击达三十多次。但在我军猛烈炮火的轰击和严密枪火的阻击下，敌军的每次攻击都遭到了失败。在战斗中，敌军有时爬上山头，但很快就被我军反击部队奋勇击退。在这连续五天的争夺战中，我军已杀伤敌军达千名以上。
