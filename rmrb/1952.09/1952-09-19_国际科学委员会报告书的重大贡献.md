The "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," after flying thousands of miles and working for two months, signed a historic investigation report in Beijing on August 31st. The report's conclusion sternly pointed out: "The people of Korea and Northeast China have indeed become the targets of bacteriological weapon attacks; the American military used these bacteriological weapons in many different ways, some of which appear to be developments of the methods used by the Japanese army during World War II to conduct bacteriological warfare." The publication of this report once again exposed the heinous crimes of American imperialism in carrying out inhumane bacteriological warfare that violates international conventions, and made a brilliant contribution to the cause of world peace.

The preface of the report mentioned: "The members of the committee… engaged in the investigation with a high degree of objectivity, following the strictest scientific principles they knew." As a participant in the anti-bacteriological warfare effort, I fully confirm that they achieved this. In order to understand the process of American military aircraft airdropping small field mice in Gannan, they personally went to this small county in western Heilongjiang Province for on-the-spot investigation; in order to verify the identification of Pasteurella pestis, they personally entered the laboratory to conduct strain testing; in order to understand how specimen insects carry Bacillus anthracis, they studied the structure of the insect in detail; in order to investigate the fact that clams carry Vibrio cholerae, they personally went to Korea to listen to witness testimony and study material evidence. Their pragmatic scientific spirit is in accordance with the "strictest scientific principles."

After they collected all the evidence, when they discussed the draft of the report, they always analyzed any question with "a high degree of objectivity." In addition to repeated research, sometimes the discussions were even very intense. But they insisted on pursuing the truth without relaxation, and only considered it satisfactory after reaching a consensus.

Before the International Scientific Commission carried out its work, American imperialism always used the excuse that the facts of bacteriological warfare had not been confirmed by international scientists in an attempt to cover up and deny it. Now, this pathetic excuse of theirs has been shattered by the report of the International Scientific Commission.

The report's content includes nineteen chapters of text and forty-six pieces of attachments, which are extremely rich and involve a wide range of issues. Now I will only elaborate on the human flea among the eighteen kinds of insects mentioned. When human fleas full of Pasteurella pestis were first discovered in Korea, the committee members felt that it was somewhat prominent. After various parties provided information and the International Scientific Commission discussed it in detail, it finally became clear that American imperialism was using human fleas to spread the plague. Under natural conditions, human fleas are second only to rat fleas in spreading the plague, but human fleas have a strong cold resistance and are especially suitable for colder regions and cold seasons. Secondly, human fleas parasitize more than rat fleas, and are more likely to find parasites to continue living and continue spreading the epidemic after being dropped. Moreover, human fleas can directly cause plague after artificial infection, without the need for the occurrence of plague in rodents (including rats). Japanese bacteriological war criminals had already mastered these experiences. The fact that American imperialism used this method again is enough to prove that the collusion of these two groups of heinous bacteriological war criminals is an ironclad fact.

Since the working spirit and working methods of the International Scientific Commission were as strict and meticulous as described above, their fair conclusions will inevitably deal a fatal blow to the shameless denials of American imperialism. At the same time, this report will surely be valued by peace-loving people all over the world. Just as their conclusion says: "Now, the people of the whole world should redouble their efforts to save the world from war and to prevent scientific inventions from being used to destroy humanity."

    国际科学委员会报告书的重大贡献
    北京农业大学昆虫学系主任教授  刘崇乐
    飞航万里、工作两月的“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”，于八月三十一日在北京签署了有历史性的调查报告书。这报告书的结论严正地指出：“朝鲜及中国东北的人民，确已成为细菌武器的攻击目标；美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器，其中有一些方法，看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间进行细菌战所使用的方法加以发展而成的。”这个报告书的公布，再次揭穿了美帝国主义进行破坏国际公约违反人道的万恶细菌战的罪行，而对世界人民保卫和平的事业作出了光辉的贡献。
    报告书的序言中提到：“委员会的委员们………以高度的客观态度，遵循他们所知道的最严格的科学原则，从事调查。”我以参加反细菌战工作人员的身份，完全证实他们是做到了这一点的。为了了解美军飞机在甘南空投小田鼠的经过，他们亲到黑龙江省西部这个小县份作了实地调查；为了证实鼠疫杆菌的鉴定，曾亲入实验室作了菌种检验的工作；为了了解标本虫如何携带炭疽杆菌，曾详细研究了该虫的构造；为了调查蛤蜊携带霍乱弧菌的事实，又曾亲到朝鲜听取人证和研究物证。他们实事求是的科学精神是符合“最严格的科学原则”的。
    在他们收集一切证据之后，当他们讨论报告书的草案时，他们对于任何一个问题，始终是“以高度的客观态度”来进行分析的。除了反复研究之外，有时讨论甚至很激烈。但是他们坚持追求真理，毫不放松，必定到获得一致意见之后，方才认为满意。
    在国际科学委员会进行工作之前，美帝国主义总是抬出细菌战的事实未经国际科学家的证实一句话来妄图掩饰和抵赖。现在，他们的这一可怜的藉口也给国际科学委员会的报告书一举而打得粉碎了。
    报告书的内容包括正文十九章附件四十六件，丰富异常，牵涉亦广。现在我只就所提到的十八种昆虫中的人蚤来加以阐明。当在朝鲜初次发现充满了鼠疫杆菌的人蚤时，委员会委员们觉得有些突出。后经各方面提供资料和国际科学委员会详细讨论，终于看出美帝国主义使用人蚤来传播鼠疫的毒计。在自然情况下，人蚤传播鼠疫虽次于鼠蚤，但人蚤耐寒力强，尤适用于较寒冷的地区和寒冷的季节。其次人蚤的寄生比鼠蚤多，被投下后较易找到寄生以继续生活继续传播疫病。还有，人蚤经过人工感染即可直接引起鼠疫，无须经过啮齿动物中（包括鼠类）鼠疫的发生。这些经验日本细菌战犯早已掌握。此次美帝国主义沿用这种方法正足以证明这两撮子万恶细菌战犯的勾结是铁的事实。
    国际科学委员会的工作精神和工作方法既如上述的严格和严密，所以他们公正的结论，一定会给美帝国主义的无耻抵赖以致命的打击。同时，这一报告书一定会受到全世界爱好和平人民的重视。正如他们的结论中所说：“现在，全世界的人民都应加倍努力，使世界免遭战祸，并制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类。”
