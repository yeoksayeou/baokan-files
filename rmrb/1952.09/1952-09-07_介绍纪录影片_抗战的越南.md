"Vietnam's War of Resistance" is a documentary film depicting the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against the French aggressors for freedom and liberation. We, the Chinese people, are deeply concerned about the struggle of the Vietnamese people. The screening of this film can help us understand the struggle and life of the Vietnamese people.

As early as 1927, Comrade Stalin said: "The time for safely exploiting and safely oppressing colonies and dependent countries has passed. The era of national liberation revolutions in colonies and dependent countries, the era of the awakening of the proletariat in these countries, the era when the proletariat plays a leading role in the revolution, has arrived." (See Stalin: "The International Character of the October Revolution")

The film begins by exposing the crimes of the colonial system and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against this system. Vietnam is a rich country with abundant resources and an excellent cultural tradition. They could have achieved good development, but the French colonialists brought deep suffering. A large number of minerals and rubber were plundered, and the people lived like beasts of burden. In 1941, due to the looting of grain by Japanese fascists and French aggressors, a tragic event occurred in which two million Vietnamese people starved to death. When imperialists defend the colonial system, they always propagate that they are helping "backward" countries to develop, that they bring culture and happiness to the colonies, but what exactly have they given to the people of the colonies? This film clearly answers this question. We see from this film that when the powerful Soviet Red Army forced Japanese imperialism to surrender, the Vietnamese people seized freedom from the Japanese invaders and declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Twenty-one days later, the French aggressors, who had fled in disarray before Japanese imperialism, returned and relaunched their war of aggression, attempting to ride on the backs of the Vietnamese people once again. However, the Vietnamese people did not yield. Under the leadership of the Vietnamese working class and its party, they launched an unyielding struggle.

The film shows the heroic and indomitable spirit of the Vietnamese people in all aspects. The struggle is arduous, and to defeat the enemy, who was superior in numbers and equipment at the time, requires a great price, but the Vietnamese people show astonishing perseverance, contributing everything to their motherland. The people warmly love their troops, the peasants work hard to increase grain production, the workers complete 300 percent, or even 355 percent, of their tasks under extremely difficult conditions, and everyone is working to defeat the enemy. We see such scenes: when people retreat, they carefully pack up the portrait of President Ho Chi Minh and the national flag and take them with them; when the motherland needs food, even the people in the enemy-occupied areas risk their lives to send food to the free zones.

Whether on the front lines or in the rear, whether on the offensive or in retreat, people are always so calm and optimistic, because they are full of confidence in the prospect of victory.

This heroic quality of the Vietnamese people is concentrated in President Ho Chi Minh. President Ho Chi Minh, the banner of the Vietnamese people's heroic resistance, is always working tirelessly and confidently, constantly studying the theories of Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary experiences of the Soviet Union and China, and guiding the Vietnamese people forward based on the actual conditions of the Vietnamese revolution. The Vietnamese people love their leader President Ho Chi Minh. We see from the film how close and respectful the peasants are to him when he appears in the fields with them!

Although the war is still going on, and although the environment is still very difficult, the government of the Vietnamese people has already begun to lead the people to establish a new life. In the film, we see the implementation of land reform, the improvement of people's cultural education, and the construction of water conservancy projects, etc. Thanks to these measures, the lives of the Vietnamese people have been initially improved, and illiteracy in the free zones has been basically eliminated. By the beginning of 1951, a total of 253,882 hectares of land had been distributed to 422,643 poor peasants. This is not a simple matter; it is an earth-shattering change. The colonial system caused serious poverty, hunger, and death. After the people became masters of their own affairs, they began to eliminate these disasters even during the years of war!

This is a clear contrast between the colonial system and the people's democratic system. This is the beginning of the people's construction of a happy life. The people believe that the working class will lead them towards socialism.

It is in this way that the Vietnamese people have gradually strengthened their ranks in the arduous struggle, defeated the enemy, and achieved the great victory of liberating 90 percent of their entire territory and annihilating more than 200,000 enemy troops today. This is also what the film emphasizes.

The last part of the film shows the international activities of the Vietnamese people. Here, we see the establishment of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and our country, we see the warm welcome received by Vietnamese representatives at the Asian Women's Representative Conference and the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representative Conference, we see the meeting between Vietnamese youth and French peace female fighter Raymonda Dien, and we also see the enthusiastic cheers received by the Vietnamese delegation at the World Youth Festival. These scenes are moving. They not only show the significance of the Vietnamese people's struggle today for Asian and world peace, but also show the friendship and support of the people of the whole world for the Vietnamese people.

The colonial system is about to be completely crushed in the face of the Vietnamese people. The American interventionists' dream of helping the French colonialists maintain their rule and vainly trying to use Vietnam as a base for aggression against China will undoubtedly go bankrupt.

This film won the "Award for the Laboring People's Struggle for Peace" at the 7th International Film Festival. We welcome the screening of this film!

    介绍纪录影片“抗战的越南”
    唐漠
    编导唱鹤龄　副导演范文科（越南）　北京电影制片厂和越南民主共和国电影社联合摄制
    “抗战的越南”是一部表现越南人民为争取自由解放、向法国侵略者作英勇斗争的纪录影片。我们中国人民热烈地关怀着越南人民的斗争。这部影片的上演可以帮助我们了解越南人民的斗争生活。
    早在一九二七年，斯大林同志就说过：“安然剥削和安然压迫殖民地和附属国的时代，已经过去了。
    殖民地和附属国里民族解放革命的时代，这些国家中无产阶级觉醒的时代，无产阶级在革命中起领导作用的时代，已经到来了。”（见斯大林：“十月革命底国际性质”）
    这部影片一开始就揭开了殖民制度的罪恶和越南人民与这种制度所作的斗争。越南是个富饶的国家，他们有丰富的物产和优秀的文化传统，他们本来可以获得良好的发展，但是法国殖民者带来了深重的灾难，大批的矿产、橡胶被掠夺，人民过着牛马般的生活。在一九四一年，由于日本法西斯和法国侵略者的抢劫粮食，竟造成了二百万越南人民活活饿死的惨剧。帝国主义者为殖民制度辩护的时候，总是宣传着他们在帮助“落后”国家发展，他们带给殖民地以文化和幸福，但是他们到底给了殖民地人民一些什么呢？这部影片清楚地回答了这个问题。我们从这部影片里看到：当强大的苏联红军迫使日本帝国主义投降，越南人民从日寇手里夺得自由，宣布了越南民主共和国成立后的第二十一天，在日本帝国主义面前狼狈逃跑的法国侵略者又回来了，他们重新发动了侵略战争，企图再骑到越南人民的头上。但是，越南人民并未屈服，他们在越南工人阶级及其政党的领导下，展开了不屈不挠的斗争。
    影片从各方面表现了越南人民英勇不屈的精神。斗争是艰苦的，要战胜当时在数量上和装备上都是优势的敌人，需要付出很大的代价，但是越南人民显示出惊人的毅力，他们为祖国贡献出一切。人民热诚地爱戴自己的队伍，农民们努力增加谷物的产量，工人们在极困难的条件下，完成了百分之三百，甚至百分之三百五十五的任务，每一个人都在为着战胜敌人而努力。我们看到这样的场面：当人们撤退的时候，他们把胡志明主席的挂像和国旗小心地收拾起来一起带走；当祖国需要粮食的时候，就是敌占区的人民也冒着危险把粮食送到自由区来。
    无论是在前线，或者后方，无论是在进攻的时候，或者退却的时候，人们总是那样的沉着和乐观，因为人们对胜利的前途充满着信心。
    越南人民这种英雄品质集中地表现在胡志明主席身上。胡志明主席，越南人民英勇抗战的旗帜，总是那么不疲倦地充满信心地工作着，不断地研究着马克思列宁主义的理论，和苏联、中国的革命经验，根据越南的革命实际，指导着越南人民前进。越南人民热爱着自己的领袖胡志明主席，我们从影片里看到，当他出现在庄稼地与农民在一起的时候，农民对他是多么的亲近而又尊敬！
    尽管战争还在进行，尽管环境还很困难，但是越南人民的政府已经领导人民开始建立新的生活。在影片里，我们看到了土地改革的进行，人民文化教育的提高，以及水利的兴修等等。由于这些措施，越南人民的生活已经得到初步的改善，自由区的文盲已经基本上肃清。截止一九五一年年初，全国已经分配了二五三、八八二公顷土地给四二二、六四三个贫苦的农民。这不是简单的事，这是惊天动地的变化。殖民制度造成了严重的贫困、饥饿和死亡，人民当了家之后，还在战争的年代就开始清除这些灾害了！
    这是殖民制度和人民民主制度的显明对照，这是人民建设幸福生活的开端，人民相信工人阶级将领导他们走向社会主义。
    也就是这样，越南人民在艰难的斗争中逐步壮大了自己的队伍，战胜了敌人，取得了今天解放全部国土百分之九十，歼敌二十多万的伟大胜利。这也是影片所着重指出的。
    影片的最后一段表现了越南人民的国际性活动，在这里我们看到了越南和我国建立外交关系，看到了在亚洲妇女代表会议和亚澳工会代表会议上，越南代表的备受欢迎，看到了越南青年和法国和平女战士雷蒙达·迪安的会见，也看到了在世界青年联欢节上，越南代表团所受到的热烈欢呼。这些场面是动人的，它不仅表现了越南人民今天的斗争对于亚洲和世界和平的意义，它也表现了全世界人民对于越南人民的友谊和支援。
    殖民制度在越南人民面前就要彻底被粉碎了。美国干涉者想要帮助法国殖民者维持其统治和妄想利用越南作为侵略中国的基地的迷梦，也毫无疑义的要破产了。
    这部影片曾在第七届国际电影节获“劳动人民争取和平斗争奖”。我们欢迎这部影片的放映！
