Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 2nd: A meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was held in mid-August under the chairmanship of President Ho Chi Minh.

    The Council of Ministers discussed the current international situation and the domestic military situation. The meeting pointed out that the Vietnamese people have successfully resisted the French army's "mopping-up" operations, which have continued on the plains of North Vietnam. The Vietnamese government and people also have appropriate plans to deal with the French army's atrocities of destroying communication lines and irrigation projects. Guerrilla warfare is developing in the French-occupied areas of North Vietnam. In other areas, activities to contain the French army are also intensifying. The Vietnamese people have maintained and developed the struggle behind enemy lines, posing a serious threat to the French army and further exhausting it in North Vietnam.
    The Council of Ministers then made decisions on major issues such as state-owned enterprises and democratic management of enterprises, land issues, rewarding patriotic production competitions, and vocational education.
    In response to the French army's strengthening of its espionage activities due to increasingly heavy military defeats, the meeting also passed a resolution to intensify the suppression of traitors and reactionaries.

    越政府举行部长会议
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社北越二日讯：越南民主共和国部长会议，八月中旬在胡志明主席主持下举行会议。
    部长会议讨论了目前的国际局势和国内军事情况。会议指出：越南人民成功地抗击了法军一直继续在北越平原进行的“扫荡”战。越南政府和人民并有了适当的计划，对付法军破坏交通线和灌溉工程的暴行。游击战正在北越法军占领区发展。在其他地区，为了牵制法军而进行的活动，也愈来愈加紧。越南人民保持并发展了敌后斗争，构成了对法军的严重威胁，愈加使法军在北越疲于奔命。
    部长会议接着在国营企业及企业民主管理问题、土地问题、奖励爱国生产竞赛问题、职业教育问题等重大问题上作出了决定。
    会议并针对法军因日益惨重的军事失败而加强其间谍活动的情况，通过了加紧镇压卖国贼和反动分子的决议。
