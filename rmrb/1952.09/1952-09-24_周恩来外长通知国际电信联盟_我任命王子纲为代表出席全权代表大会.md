Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) will hold a Plenipotentiary Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 1st. Under the coercion and manipulation of the US government, the ITU has not invited our government to send representatives to attend the conference. To this end, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, sent a telegram to Mr. Müllatier, Secretary-General of the ITU, on September 23rd, notifying the appointment of Wang Zijiang as the Chief Plenipotentiary Representative of China to the conference, and demanding that the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique in Taiwan be expelled from all institutions and meetings of the ITU. The telegram reads as follows:

Mr. Müllatier, Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union, Geneva:

On March 29th, April 1st, and August 26th, 1950, I, on behalf of the People's Republic of China, successively telegraphed the International Telecommunication Union, appointing Li Qiang as the Chief Representative of the People's Republic of China to attend various meetings of the ITU, and demanding that the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique in Taiwan be expelled from all institutions and meetings of the ITU. However, under the coercion and manipulation of the US government, the International Telecommunication Union has unreasonably excluded the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China and continues to illegally accommodate the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique in Taiwan. This is an illegal act that undermines international cooperation and violates the legitimate rights of the Chinese people.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China. A small group of Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan, who have long been abandoned by the Chinese people, are absolutely not qualified to represent China. The People's Republic of China maintains and expands extensive international telecommunications links with countries all over the world. Any meeting concerning international telecommunications services or radio frequency allocation plans cannot solve any international telecommunications problems without the participation and consent of representatives of the People's Republic of China.

The International Telecommunication Union will convene a Plenipotentiary Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 1st of this year. I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, notify the following: The People's Republic of China has appointed Wang Zijiang as the Chief Plenipotentiary Representative to attend the conference. I solemnly declare that if the Plenipotentiary Conference, under the coercion of the US government, continues to obstruct the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, or continues to accommodate the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique in Taiwan, all its resolutions will be illegal and therefore invalid. All the responsibility for undermining international cooperation, obstructing the smooth flow of international telecommunications services, and causing disturbances in the skywaves shall be borne entirely by the United States and the countries that follow the United States.

Please acknowledge receipt and circulate this telegram to all member states of the International Telecommunication Union.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai
September 23, 1952

Note: The International Telecommunication Union is a technical international organization under the United Nations specialized agencies related to international telecommunications services. Its predecessor was the Paris International Telegraph Union of 1865 and the Berlin International Radiotelegraph Union of 1906. It was reorganized at the Plenipotentiary Conference held in Atlantic City, USA, in 1947, and the current International Telecommunication Union was established. At the meeting, a new International Telecommunication Convention was formulated based on the old "Madrid International Telecommunication Convention" and became one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. The highest authority of the ITU is the Plenipotentiary Conference, which is held every five years. The ITU currently has 82 member states, including the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries.

China is one of the member states of the International Telecommunication Union. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai telegraphed the ITU in March, April, and August 1950, appointing Li Qiang as China's Chief Representative to attend various meetings of the ITU, and demanding the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representatives who falsely claimed to represent "China" at the ITU Broadcasting Conference and the 5th Administrative Council Meeting. These meetings all discussed the issue of China's right of representation. The Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries repeatedly supported China's just demands at the meetings, but under the coercion of the US government, China's legitimate status in the ITU has been illegally excluded.

### 周恩来外长通知国际电信联盟  我任命王子纲为代表出席全权代表大会

    周恩来外长通知国际电信联盟
    我任命王子纲为代表出席全权代表大会
    【新华社二十三日讯】国际电信联盟将于十月一日在阿根廷布宜诺斯艾利斯举行全权代表大会。在美国政府挟持操纵下，该联盟竟未曾邀请我国政府派遣代表出席此次大会。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长为此于九月二十三日致电国际电信联盟秘书长缪拉齐埃，通知任命王子纲为我出席此次大会首席全权代表，并要求将台湾国民党残余集团的所谓代表，从该联盟的各项机构和会议中驱逐出去。电文如下：日内瓦国际电信联盟秘书长缪拉齐埃先生：
    一九五○年三月二十九日、四月一日及八月二十六日我曾先后代表中华人民共和国致电国际电信联盟，任命李强为中华人民共和国参加国际电信联盟各项会议的首席代表，并要求将台湾中国国民党残余集团的所谓代表从该联盟的各项机构和会议中驱逐出去。然而，国际电信联盟在美国政府挟持操纵之下，竟无理排斥中华人民共和国的合法代表，继续非法容纳台湾中国国民党残余集团的所谓代表。这是破坏国际合作和侵犯中国人民合法权利的非法行为。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国的唯一合法政府。在台湾的一小撮早已被中国人民唾弃的中国国民党残余集团绝对没有资格代表中国。中华人民共和国与全世界各国保持并扩大了广泛的国际电信的联系。任何有关国际电信业务或无线电频率分配计划的会议，如无中华人民共和国代表的参加和同意，绝不可能解决国际电信的任何问题。
    国际电信联盟将于本年十月一日在阿根廷布宜诺斯艾利斯召开全权代表大会。我现代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府通知如下：中华人民共和国已任命王子纲为出席该大会的首席全权代表。我并郑重声明：如果该全权代表大会在美国政府挟持之下，继续阻挠中华人民共和国代表的参加，或仍容纳台湾中国国民党残余集团的所谓代表，则其一切决议都将是非法的，因而也是无效的；所有因此破坏国际合作而障碍国际电信业务的畅通和引起天空电波方面的紊乱，应由美国及追随美国的国家负完全责任。
    即请查照电复，并通电国际电信联盟各会员国为荷。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
    一九五二年九月二十三日
    按：国际电信联盟是联合国专门机构中一个有关国际电信业务方面的技术性国际组织。它的前身是一八六五年的巴黎国际电报联盟和一九○六年的柏林国际无线电联盟，于一九四七年美国大西洋城举行的全权代表大会改组，成立了现在的国际电信联盟。会上根据旧的“马德里城国际电信公约”，订立了新的国际电信公约，并成为联合国专门机构之一。联盟最高权力机构是全权代表大会，每五年召开一次。联盟现有会员国八十二个，包括苏联和东欧人民民主国家。
    中国为国际电信联盟会员国之一。我中央人民政府成立后，外交部周恩来部长曾先后在一九五○年三月、四月、八月致电该联盟，任命李强为我首席代表，出席该联盟各项会议；并要求驱逐冒名“中国”出席该联盟广播会议及第五届行政理事会的蒋匪代表。各该会议均曾讨论了我代表权问题；苏联及东欧人民民主国家在会上一再支持我正义要求，但在美国政府挟持之下，我在该联盟的合法地位竟受到非法排斥。
