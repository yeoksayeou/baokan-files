Since the founding of the Central People's Government, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the people of the whole country have been engaged in the restoration and construction of the motherland's economy, culture, and various other undertakings with a high degree of patriotism, and have made brilliant achievements. The same is true in the field of relief work, where considerable achievements have also been made. Since its establishment in April 1950, the Chinese People's Relief Association, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, has adhered to the principle of "uniting and leading groups and individuals engaged in relief and welfare undertakings throughout the country, and assisting the government in organizing the masses to engage in production and conservation, mutual aid in labor, in order to promote the relief and welfare undertakings of the masses." The following work has been done:

(1) There are many old-style social relief and welfare organizations throughout the country, both international and domestic, as well as national and local. In the past, under reactionary rule, such organizations were controlled and utilized by imperialism and feudal forces as decorations for the ruling class to deceive and paralyze the people. After liberation, some still had the strength to engage in relief and welfare undertakings, but many were nominal and played no role in relief and welfare. Therefore, after its establishment, the Chinese People's Relief Association regarded the adjustment of old social relief and welfare organizations in various places as an urgent task. Starting in 1950, the Chinese People's Relief Association conducted investigations and studies on international and domestic organizations with larger scales, and in August of the same year, it adjusted the old Red Cross Society of China, the largest domestic organization, through consultation. Since the emergence of the new Red Cross Society of China, it has played an active role in the medical work of the Huai River project, the rescue work on the front and rear of Korea, the medical and epidemic prevention work in the old revolutionary base areas and ethnic minority areas, and the struggle against aggression and defense of peace internationally. There were originally more than 40 international relief organizations, most of which have withdrawn or disbanded since liberation. The last nine remaining were all organizations that accepted American subsidies. A conference on handling relief agencies accepting American subsidies was held at the end of April 1951, and these organizations have been dealt with and transformed. There are many local relief and welfare organizations throughout the country, and the situation is also very complicated. Uniting and transforming such organizations is one of the important tasks of the new China's relief and welfare undertakings. In addition to dealing with reactionary, nominal, and hypocritical organizations, the general situation is carefully considered for unity and transformation, and through various appropriate organizational forms, they are actively involved in local relief and welfare undertakings under unified leadership, giving play to their consciousness and enthusiasm in serving the people. In total, under the leadership of the Chinese People's Relief Association, local branches have organized or contacted more than 800 old relief and welfare organizations.

(2) In 1950, floods occurred in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, and other places. In order to assist the government in solving the problem of winter clothing for the people in the disaster areas, the Chinese People's Relief Association and relevant people's organizations established the "General Association for Soliciting Winter Clothing for Disaster Victims in Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan," launching a nationwide campaign to solicit winter clothing, and issued a call to the whole country to raise six million sets of winter clothing. With the enthusiastic support of the Party, government, military, and people across the country, more than 6.88 million sets of winter clothing were raised in just two months, worth about 350 billion yuan, exceeding the original target by 14%, allowing the compatriots in the disaster areas to quickly receive genuine warmth and get through the cold winter. This is a concrete manifestation of the improvement of the Chinese people's political consciousness and the improvement of China's economic situation. It shattered the shameless slander of the American imperialists that the Chinese people must rely on the alms of the American imperialists with iron facts, and proved the greatness of the Chinese people's strength under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. This movement not only created a brilliant example for "mutual assistance between urban and rural areas" and "self-reliance and helping others," but also proved the correctness of the new China's relief and welfare policy.

(3) The United States directly or through subsidies ran hundreds of "relief" agencies in China. These agencies seriously harmed the lives of the Chinese people, infringed upon and plundered the culture and property of the Chinese people. Their purpose was to use "relief" as a highly profitable aggressive political investment. In order to eliminate the aggressive influence of American imperialism in China's relief undertakings, in accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council on December 29, 1950, the Chinese People's Relief Association accepted the task assigned by the "Government Administration Council Committee for Handling Relief Agencies Accepting American Subsidies" and carried out the work of handling relief agencies accepting American subsidies. A total of 246 relief agencies accepting American subsidies and a small number of relief agencies accepting other foreign subsidies that were not well-managed have now been dealt with (including 159 children's relief agencies), accommodating 18,800 people and employing more than 2,500 staff members. During the handling process, many places held accusation meetings with thousands or even tens of thousands of people, exposing the crimes of imperialism, especially American imperialism, in killing people under the guise of "relief." For example, in the Wuchang Garden Mountain Nursery, which was run solely by American imperialism, 16,000 Chinese children were abused and killed in 23 years alone. After these agencies were dealt with, Chinese staff, nuns, and local religious figures were united, and they worked together to run the acquired undertakings well. Imperialist elements with heinous crimes have been liquidated and tried by the people. The lives of the elderly, children, and infants who were accommodated have been significantly improved. Some branches have also made appropriate adjustments to the agencies they have taken over and carried out the work of accommodating abandoned infants.

(4) The oppression and exploitation of the Chinese people by the three enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have led to the poverty of the Chinese people. As a result, a large number of vagrants, beggars, thieves, prostitutes, the disabled elderly, and orphans have emerged in the cities. This is a thorny issue left to the new China by the reactionary rulers. However, the victorious Chinese people are capable of overcoming any difficulties. Over the past three years, vigorous accommodation and transformation work has been carried out on them in major cities across the country. Countless production and education institutions of different natures have been established in major cities across the country. Vagrants, beggars, thieves, prostitutes, the disabled elderly, and orphans have been accommodated in large numbers and given considerable ideological and cultural education. Most of them have learned various production skills and become new people who love labor and are capable of production. In addition to the local civil affairs departments, the branches of the Chinese People's Relief Association have run 98 accommodation and education institutions, including 55 that accommodate children.

The social poverty of old China caused by the oppression and exploitation of reactionary rulers made the people lose their ability to resist disasters. Once they encountered temporarily unavoidable disasters, a large number of disaster victims were produced. The people's government has taken necessary measures for the disaster victims by means of production for self-relief; the local branches of the Chinese People's Relief Association have assisted the government in handling the temporary accommodation, emergency relief, and repatriation of disaster victims to their hometowns for production, overcoming the disasters. In the past two and a half years, it is reported that more than 130,000 disaster victims have been accommodated and repatriated (incomplete statistics).

(5) Urban poverty relief and temporary relief cover a wide range. The local branches of the Chinese People's Relief Association have done a lot of work in conjunction with local specific conditions, such as subsidies for the poor and sick, subsidies for poor infants, subsidies for pregnant women, subsidies for the living expenses of the poor, and relief for urban fires and wind disasters. According to preliminary statistics, the number of people who have benefited from the poverty relief and temporary relief handled by the relief branches is more than 70,000. In this work, some were carried out by mobilizing the masses in accordance with the principle of "social mutual assistance." For example, the Hangzhou branch provided relief to the fire victims in the Jianggan District, and the masses voluntarily donated more than 800 million yuan; the Wuhan branch provided relief to the fire victims in the re-divided district, and the masses voluntarily donated as much as 1.2 billion yuan and donated a large amount of clothing and food. This is the promotion of the fine tradition of mutual assistance among the Chinese people.

(6) At the end of 1950, in the upsurge of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, a donation campaign to express sympathy and appreciation to the Chinese and Korean people's forces and to relieve Korean refugees was universally launched across the country. The Chinese People's Relief Association also became a powerful promoter and organizer in this movement. In order to aid the peaceful Korean people who suffered severe disasters under the crazy bombing and looting of American imperialism, the Chinese People's Relief Association, in coordination with other relevant people's organizations, formed the "Chinese People's Relief Committee for Korean Refugees" under the leadership of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and purchased and transported a large number of fabrics, cotton, cotton clothing, blankets, needles, thread, medical supplies, and emergency relief grain to Korea. Recently, American imperialists have intensified their crazy bombing of peaceful Korean cities, deliberately destroying peace and creating more disasters for the peaceful Korean people. The Chinese People's Relief Association has lodged a serious protest and called on relief and welfare workers across the country to support the just struggle of the Korean people against barbaric aggression with practical actions.

In 1951, the Chinese People's Relief Association sent the donations from the Chinese people to the "Matsukawa Incident" to the Japanese people to help the victims of the "Matsukawa Incident." This year, an earthquake in Hokkaido, Japan, caused severe disasters to the Japanese people. The reactionary Japanese government not only failed to provide relief, but took the opportunity to extort money; the Chinese People's Relief Association promptly remitted funds to relieve the earthquake victims in Hokkaido. These two aids have greatly increased the friendship between the Japanese and Chinese people, and have made the Japanese people deeply understand that their struggle for peace and democracy is not isolated. In addition, we have also jointly with relevant people's organizations provided some necessary relief to the Indian people who suffered severe drought; and organized the "Chinese People's Relief Committee for Malayan Refugees" to make just appeals for overseas Chinese in Malaya who were oppressed by the British imperialist colonial authorities. The Chinese people who have stood up deeply know that the consolidation and development of the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the consolidation and development of the revolutionary victory of the international peace and democracy camp. Today, we have the obligation and the strength to help countries and peoples who have suffered disasters in the just struggle of national liberation movements and people's democratic movements.

In addition to the above work, some branches have also carried out some welfare undertakings of a relief nature, such as maternity hospitals, clinics, nurseries, nursery worker training classes, public housing, labor service stations, charity warehouses, summer drinking water, etc. These works have benefited the working people and the urban poor.

The relief and welfare undertaking of the new China is an integral part of a series of works in which the government and the people work together to heal the wounds of war and carry out peaceful construction. The Chinese People's Relief Association unites relief and welfare workers across the country and organizes the masses to make considerable achievements in this part of the work. The Chinese people have used their own strength to heal the wounds of war and are working hard with confidence and optimism to further improve relief work and strive to improve the people's welfare!

    中国人民救济总会两年半来的工作概况
    中国人民救济总会秘书长    伍云甫
    中央人民政府成立以来，全国人民在毛主席和共产党的领导下，以高度的爱国主义热情从事祖国的经济、文化及其他各种事业的恢复和建设，做出了辉煌的成绩；在救济事业方面，也同样获得了不少的成就。中国人民救济总会自一九五○年四月成立后的两年半以来，在中央人民政府领导下，本着“团结并领导全国从事救济福利事业之团体及个人，协助政府组织群众进行生产节约、劳动互助，以推进人民大众的救济福利事业”的方针，做了下面一些工作。
    （一）全国各地有许多旧式的社会救济福利团体，有国际性的和国内性的，也有全国性的和地方性的。这类团体，过去在反动统治下为帝国主义和封建势力所控制利用，作为统治阶级欺骗和麻痹人民的装饰品。解放后，有些还有力量从事救济福利事业，但有很多是名存实亡，对救济福利事业不起什么作用。因此，中国人民救济总会在成立后即以调整各地旧有社会救济福利团体为当前急务。从一九五○年开始，中国人民救济总会对国际与国内规模较大的团体进行了调查研究，同年八月即用协商方式对国内规模最大的旧的红十字会总会进行了调整。自新的中国红十字会总会出现后，在治淮工程的医疗工作上，在朝鲜前后方的救护工作上，在老根据地和少数民族地区的医疗防疫工作上，以及在国际反对侵略保卫和平的斗争上，都起了积极的作用。国际性救济团体原有四十多个，解放后大部已撤退或解散，最后残存的九个全是接受美国津贴的团体，一九五一年四月底召开的处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议，对这些团体已进行了处理与改造。全国各地地方性的救济福利团体很多，情况也很复杂，对这类团体的团结改造，是新中国救济福利事业的重要工作之一。除了对反动的、名存实亡的和假冒为善的团体予以处理外，一般的斟酌情况予以团结改造，并通过各种适当的组织形式，使它们在统一领导下积极地参加当地的救济福利事业，发挥其为人民服务的自觉性与积极性。总计在中国人民救济总会领导下，各地分会已将八百多个旧的救济福利团体组织或联系起来了。
    （二）一九五○年皖北、苏北、河北、河南等地发生水灾，为了协助政府解决灾区人民的寒衣问题，中国人民救济总会与有关人民团体成立了“皖北、苏北、河北、河南灾民寒衣劝募总会”，发动了全国性的劝募寒衣运动，向全国发出了募集六百万套寒衣的号召。在全国党政军民的热烈支持下，短短两个月中，便募集了寒衣六百八十八万余套，约值人民币三千五百亿元，超过原定任务百分之十四，使灾区同胞很快地得到了真正的温暖，度过了严寒的冬天。这是中国人民政治觉悟提高、中国经济状况好转的具体表现。它以铁的事实粉碎了美帝国主义者诽谤中国人民必须依靠美帝国主义施舍的无耻谰言，证明中国人民在毛主席与共产党领导之下力量的伟大。这一运动不仅为“城乡互助”“自救助人”创造了辉煌的范例，而且也证明了新中国救济福利事业方针的正确性。
    （三）美国直接或以津贴方式在中国举办了几百个“救济”机关，这些机关严重地损害了中国人民的生命，侵害并掠夺了中国人民的文化和财产，其目的是把“救济”当作利润很高的侵略性的政治投资。为了肃清美帝国主义在中国救济事业中的侵略影响，遵照政务院一九五○年十二月二十九日的决定，中国人民救济总会接受了“政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会”所给予的任务，对接受美国津贴的救济机关进行了处理工作，现已全部处理了接受美国津贴的救济机关和少数办理不善的接受其他外国津贴的救济机关共二百四十六个（其中儿童救济机关一百五十九个），收容人数有一万八千八百人，工作人员二千五百余人。在进行处理工作时，许多地方举行了数千人以至数万人的控诉大会，揭发了帝国主义尤其是美帝国主义在“救济”美名下杀人的罪行，例如仅美帝国主义举办的武昌花园山育婴堂一处，二十三年中就虐杀了一万六千个中国儿童。这些机关处理后，团结了中国籍工作人员、修女及当地宗教界人士，并和他们共同来办好接管事业，其中罪大恶极的帝国主义分子已遭到人民的清算和审判。被收容的老人、儿童、婴儿们的生活显著地改善了。有些分会还对接收过的机关作了适当的调整，进行了收容弃婴的工作。
    （四）帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义这三个敌人，对中国人民的压迫和剥削，造成了中国人民的贫困，因而在城市里产生了大批的游民、乞丐、小偷、妓女、残老和孤儿，这是反动统治者留给新中国的一个棘手的问题。但是，已经胜利了的中国人民，是能够克服任何困难的。三年来在全国各主要城市里已经对他们大力地进行了收容和改造工作，无数的不同性质的生产教养院在全国各主要城市里成立起来了，游民、乞丐、小偷、妓女、残老、孤儿，大量地被收容进去，并施以相当的思想和文化教育，他们大都学会了各种生产技能，变成了爱劳动、能生产的新人。除了各地民政部门以外，中国人民救济总会各地分会办理的收容教养机构有九十八个，其中收容儿童的有五十五个。
    反动统治者压迫和剥削所造成的旧中国的社会贫困，使人民失去了对灾难的抵抗力，一遇到暂时还不可避免的灾害，就产生了大批灾民。人民政府以生产自救的办法对灾难民进行了必要的措施；中国人民救济总会各地分会协助政府办理灾难民的临时收容、紧急救济和遣送回乡生产的工作，克服了灾难，两年半来收容遣送灾难民据不完全统计达十三万余人。
    （五）城市贫民救济和临时救济包括的范围很广，中国人民救济总会各地分会结合当地具体情况做了不少工作，如贫病补助、贫婴补助、产妇补助、贫民生活补助和城市火灾、风灾救济等等，据初步统计，救济分会所办理的贫民救济和临时救济受益人数有七万余人。在这项工作中，有些是依照“社会互助”的方针发动群众进行的。如杭州市分会救济江干区火灾灾民，群众自动捐款八亿余元；武汉市分会救济重划区火灾灾民，群众自动捐款达十二亿余元，并捐助了大批衣物粮食。这是中国人民互助精神的优良传统的发扬。
    （六）一九五○年年底，全国各地在抗美援朝运动的热潮中，普遍地掀起了慰劳中朝人民部队和救济朝鲜难民的募捐运动，中国人民救济总会在这一运动中也成为有力的推动者和组织者。为了援助在美帝国主义疯狂轰炸焚掠下遭受严重灾害的朝鲜和平人民，中国人民救济总会协同其他有关人民团体，在抗美援朝总会领导下组成了“中国人民救济朝鲜难民委员会”，购运了大批布匹、棉花、棉衣、毛毯、针、线、医药物资及紧急救济粮到朝鲜。最近美帝国主义者对朝鲜和平城市进行变本加厉的疯狂轰炸，蓄意破坏和平，给朝鲜和平人民制造了更多的灾难，中国人民救济总会提出了严重抗议，并号召全国救济福利工作者以实际行动支援朝鲜人民反对野蛮侵略的正义斗争。
    一九五一年中国人民救济总会将中国人民为援助“松川事件”被迫害的日本人民的捐款寄到日本，援助了“松川事件”的受难人士。今年日本北海道地震，使日本人民遭到严重的灾害，日本反动政府不但不予救济，反而乘机勒索；中国人民救济总会及时地汇去了救济北海道地震灾民的款项。这两次的援助都大大地增进了日本人民和中国人民之间的友谊，并且使日本人民深深地懂得他们争取和平民主的斗争不是孤立的。此外，我们还曾联合有关人民团体对遭受严重旱灾的印度人民进行了一些必要的救济；组织了“中国人民救济马来亚难侨委员会”，对受英帝国主义殖民当局压迫的马来亚华侨作了正义声援。已经站起来了的中国人民，深知中国革命胜利的巩固和发展是与国际和平民主阵营革命胜利的巩固和发展分不开的。今天，我们有义务也有力量来救助在民族解放运动与人民民主运动的正义斗争中遭受灾难的国家与人民。
    除以上工作外，有些分会还办理了一些救济性质的福利事业，如产院、诊所、托儿所、保育员训练班、平民宿舍、劳动人民服务站、义仓、夏令饮水等等，这些工作，对劳动人民和城市贫民都有所裨益。
    新中国的救济福利事业，是政府和人民同心协力医治战争创伤并进行和平建设一系列工作中的一个组成部分，中国人民救济总会团结全国救济福利工作者，组织群众，在这部分工作中做出了不少成绩。中国人民已经用自己的力量医治了战争创伤，正满怀信心地极其乐观地在加倍努力，以便进一步把救济工作做好，为增进人民福利而奋斗！
