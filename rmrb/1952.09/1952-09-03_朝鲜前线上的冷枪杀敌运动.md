Cold Sniper Campaign on the Korean Front
Wang Yuzhang Xu Xiong Shi Feng Guo Zhen Li Tian'en

Since last summer, our army's defense line has become more solid. Although the enemy launched two large-scale key offensives and countless small-scale attacks, they have never been able to break through our army's defense line. On this front line spanning more than 200 kilometers across the Korean Peninsula, the enemy and our positions are only tens to thousands of meters apart. In addition to the frequent short and fierce battles, the sharpshooters and artillery aces of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have been hunting down the enemy day and night with sudden bursts of gunfire and artillery fire, killing them by the dozens and hundreds. On the Yuyin Mountain position in the eastern part of the front line, one squad of a certain unit killed eighteen enemies in one day with cold shots; sniper Ye Shaoqi killed four enemies by himself. Sniper Zou Xixiang, who was guarding Mount Wusheng, killed six enemies with eleven bullets in one day. Everyone patrolling the front line can hear the sound of such sniping at any time, and with this sound, invading soldiers are constantly losing their lives. The enemy, frightened by our army's snipers, hides in bunkers and rarely comes out. The snipers then use rifles to aim at the gun holes in the enemy's bunkers, shooting the enemies lying behind the gun holes. As soon as the shot rings out, the dark gun hole suddenly lights up, and the enemy inside is hit and falls to the ground. On the Yuyin Mountain position, the gun holes of the enemy bunkers light up several times a day, and the enemy is so scared that they don't even dare to turn on the lights at night.

The artillery aces and anti-aircraft gunners on the forward positions have also opened up new battlefields for themselves. Recoilless gunner Gao Kui destroyed an enemy anti-tank gun with one shell. Soon, the enemy also moved in a recoilless gun, and every time Gao Kui fired, the enemy gun would fire back at Gao Kui in retaliation. The clever Gao Kui organized two guns, one to hit the enemy infantry, and the other to ambush nearby, waiting for the enemy gun to fire before suddenly aiming and firing. They destroyed the enemy, men and gun together, with just one shell. On another position, the enemy artillery blindly fired at our army's position every day. Sixty-mm mortar gunner Wang Wengui carefully calculated the distance and position of the enemy gun, and when the enemy gun fired again, he destroyed the enemy gun with two shells. Wang Wengui estimated that the enemy might still set up a gun in that place, so he aimed at the target and planted a marker. Soon, the enemy did install a recoilless gun in that place, and when the enemy fired the first shell, Wang Wengui, who was eating, put down his rice bowl and ran into the artillery bunker, driving the enemy away with only four shells. The anti-aircraft machine gunners on the mountain could not bear it either. Before the enemy planes came, they laid the anti-aircraft machine guns flat and chased the cars traveling near the enemy's position with strings of bullets. Shooter Tang Lianglu's anti-aircraft machine gun destroyed twenty-six enemy vehicles. Anti-aircraft machine gunner Ye Zhanqi, who once shot down an enemy plane with six machine gun bullets, used anti-aircraft machine guns to block the enemy's traffic arteries on the mountaintop, destroying fourteen enemy vehicles in one month.

This cold sniper campaign has brought serious threats and terror to the enemy. So the enemy drove many tanks to the front of our position, specifically to deal with our snipers. Our army's snipers and artillery warriors more resolutely attacked the enemy tanks. One day, the enemy tanks were rampantly firing artillery shells in front of Mount Wusheng. Suddenly, a row of artillery shells flew out of Mount Wusheng, blasting the enemy infantry hiding next to the tanks, killing and wounding them. At this time, two rocket shells also flew out of the grass not far in front of the enemy tanks, shooting into the enemy tank's turret. With a bang, the enemy tank was blown up and caught fire. This was a masterpiece of sniping enemy tanks jointly created by rocket launcher shooter Li Jinming and long-range artillery.

The method of sniping the enemy with cold guns and cold cannons on the outpost positions is becoming more and more clever. Infantry snipers now often cooperate with artillery gunners in joint operations. Sometimes, the artillery gunners first bombard the enemies hiding in the fortifications with artillery shells, and when the enemies just crawl out of the collapsed fortifications, the infantry snipers have prepared bullets to send them to their deaths. The enemies who manage to crawl out of the infantry fire are lucky enough to escape to the back of the mountain, and the mortar shells and sixty-mm shells chase after them. Warrior Luo Hengxiao created a record of killing fifty-one enemies. Sixty-mm mortar gunner Wang Wengui has already killed or wounded eighty-five enemies. A mortar company of a certain unit launched a "kill a hundred enemies campaign" this summer to commemorate the "July 1st" anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and to welcome the "August 1st" anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Gunner Peng Liangyi's gun quickly created a new record of killing one hundred and fifty enemies, and also destroyed three enemy bunkers, destroyed one vehicle and two anti-aircraft machine guns. Sixty-seven rifle snipers of the sixth company of a certain unit killed eight hundred and two enemies in three months. The entire sniper killing competition on Mount Wusheng has achieved a brilliant victory of annihilating 2,823 enemies in three months; it has also destroyed nineteen enemy tanks, eighty-eight vehicles, and one hundred and seventy bunkers.

The cold sniper campaign that our army is increasingly widely launching on the front line is causing serious depletion of the manpower of the American invading army. The number of enemies annihilated by the snipers also accounts for an increasingly large proportion of the total number of enemies annihilated on the entire front line.

    朝鲜前线上的冷枪杀敌运动
    王玉章　徐熊　石峰　郭振　李天恩
    去年夏季以来，我军的防线更加稳固了。敌人虽然举行了两次大规模的重点攻势和无数次小规模攻击，但始终未能突破我军防线。在这条横贯朝鲜半岛的二百多公里长的战线上，敌我阵地之间相距仅数十公尺至千余公尺。除了经常发生短促而激烈的争夺战之外，中国人民志愿军的神枪手、神炮手们就日日夜夜地用突然发作的枪火和炮火，成十成百地猎取着敌人的性命。在战线东部的鱼隐山阵地上，某部一个班在一天中用冷枪就打死了十八个敌人；狙击手叶少其一个人就打死了四个敌人。扼守在五圣山上的狙击手邹习祥，在一天中用十一发子弹打死了六个敌人。每一个在战线上巡行的人，随时都可听到这种狙击的枪声，随着这枪声侵略军士兵不断地在丧命。敌人被我军狙击手们打怕了，就躲避在地堡里轻易不出来。狙击手们便用步枪瞄准敌人地堡上的枪眼，射击伏在枪眼后面的敌人。枪声一响，黑黝黝的枪眼就忽然亮起来，里面的敌人被击中倒地。在鱼隐山阵地上，敌人地堡的枪眼每天都这样亮几次，在晚上敌人吓得连灯都不敢点。
    在前沿阵地上的神炮手和对空射击手们也替自己开辟了新的战场。无座力炮手高奎用一发炮弹打坏了敌人的一挺战防枪。不久，敌人也搬来一门无座力炮，每当高奎打炮时，敌炮就开火向高奎进行报复。聪明的高奎就组织起两门炮，一门打敌人步兵，一门埋伏在旁边，单等敌炮发火的时候，突然瞄准敌炮射击。他们只用了一发炮弹就把敌人连人带炮一齐打掉了。在另一阵地上，敌炮每天向我军阵地盲目发射。六零炮手王文贵就仔细计算好敌炮的距离、位置，等敌炮再发射时，他用二发炮弹就把敌炮炸毁了。王文贵估计敌人可能还在那个地方架炮，就瞄准这目标插下了标杆。不久，敌人果然又在那个地方按了一门无座力炮，当敌人打出第一发炮弹时，正在吃饭的王文贵就放下饭碗跑进炮工事，仅以四发炮弹就把敌人打跑了。在山头上的高射机枪手们也耐不住了，他们在敌机未来时就把高射机枪枪身平放下来，用一串串的子弹追逐着在敌人阵地附近来往的汽车。射手唐良禄的一挺高射机枪就击毁了敌人二十六辆汽车。曾用六发机枪子弹击落敌机一架的高射机枪手叶站启，在山顶上用高射机枪封锁敌人的交通要路，在一个月内击毁了敌人的十四辆汽车。
    这种冷枪杀敌运动，已给敌人带来严重威胁和恐怖。于是敌人把许多坦克开到我阵地前沿，专以对付我们的狙击手。我军狙击手和炮兵勇士们更坚决地打击敌人坦克。有一天，敌人的坦克正在五圣山前猖狂地乱打炮，五圣山上忽然飞出了一排炮弹，把躲在坦克旁边的敌人步兵炸得死的死伤的伤。这时，在敌人坦克前面不远的草丛中，也飞出两发火箭炮弹，射进敌坦克的炮塔，轰然一声，把敌人的坦克炸得燃烧起来。这是火箭筒射手李金明和远射程炮兵联合创造的狙击敌军坦克的杰作。
    前哨阵地上冷枪冷炮狙击敌人的办法是越来越巧妙。步兵狙击手们现在经常和炮手们配合着进行联合作战，有时炮手们先用炮弹轰击藏在工事里的敌人，当敌人刚从被打塌了的工事里钻出来时，步兵狙击手们又替敌人准备好了送命的子弹。从步兵火器下侥幸地钻出来的敌人好容易逃到山的背后，迫击炮、六零炮弹又追击上去了。战士罗恒孝创造了杀敌五十一名的纪录。六零炮手王文贵已经杀伤了八十五个敌人。某部迫击炮连在今年夏天为了纪念
    “七一”中国共产党的诞生日和迎接“八一”中国人民解放军建军节，曾开展了一个“杀敌百人运动”。炮手彭良义的那门炮很快就创造了杀敌一百五十名的新纪录，而且还摧毁了敌人三个地堡，击毁了一辆汽车和二挺高射机关枪。某部六连的六十七名步枪狙击手在三个月中杀敌八百零二名。整个五圣山上的狙击杀敌竞赛已在三个月内取得了歼敌二千八百二十三人的辉煌胜利；还击毁了敌人十九辆坦克、八十八辆汽车和一百七十个地堡。
    我军在前线日益广泛展开的冷枪杀敌运动，正使美国侵略军的兵员受到严重的消耗，狙击手们歼敌的数量，也在整个战线歼敌统计数字中占有愈来愈大的比例。
