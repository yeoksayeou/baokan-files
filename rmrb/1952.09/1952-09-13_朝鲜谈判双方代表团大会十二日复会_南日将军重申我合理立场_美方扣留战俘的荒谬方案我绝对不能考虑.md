Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 12th: At the plenary session of the Korean armistice talks on the 12th, the chief representative of the other side, Harrison, continued to insist on the detention of prisoners of war, and fabricated childish and absurd arguments in an attempt to deceive the people of the world and sow discord between China and Korea. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, solemnly pointed out that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will fight to the end for the absolutely fair and reasonable position that every prisoner of war should return home to live a peaceful life. The other side's absurd plan to detain 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war completely violates the 1949 Geneva Convention and the prisoner-of-war repatriation clauses of the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides, and is something that our side can absolutely not consider under any circumstances. General Nam Il vehemently condemned the other side for persecuting and slaughtering prisoners of war, forcing prisoners of war to become special agents, and turning prisoner-of-war camps into slaughterhouses, and yet shamelessly fabricated the outright lie that our captured personnel are seeking asylum with the other side. For the benefit of a handful of arms dealers and warmongers, the other side is willing to persist in its demand to detain prisoners of war, delaying and preventing the realization of the Korean armistice, and driving soldiers from more than a dozen countries to continue to shed blood. The people of the other side's so-called allied countries and the people of the United States are increasingly opposed to the unjust war being waged by the other side. If the other side ignores the opposition of the people of the world and continues to insist on its demand to detain prisoners of war, deliberately continuing and even expanding the Korean War, utter defeat will be the other side's fate. At the suggestion of the other side, the plenary session of the two delegations adjourned again for seven days and will resume on September 20.

    朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会十二日复会
    南日将军重申我合理立场
    美方扣留战俘的荒谬方案我绝对不能考虑
    【新华社开城十二日电】十二日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，对方首席代表哈利逊仍然坚持扣留战俘的主张，并捏造幼稚荒谬的论点，妄图欺骗世界人民，挑拨朝中关系。我方首席代表南日将军严正指出：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军将为每一个战俘回家过和平生活的绝对公平合理的立场战斗到底。对方企图扣留百分之二十朝鲜人民军战俘和百分之六十八中国人民志愿军战俘的荒谬方案，彻底违反了一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方已经协议的停战协定草案的遣俘条款，是我方在任何情况下所绝对不能考虑的。南日将军痛斥对方迫害屠杀战俘，强迫战俘作特务，将战俘营变成了屠宰场，而竟还无耻捏造所谓我方被俘人员向对方寻求避难所的彻头彻尾的谎言。为了一小撮军火商人和战争贩子的利益，对方不惜坚持扣留战俘的主张，拖延、阻止朝鲜停战的实现，驱使十余个国家的士兵继续流血。对方的所谓同盟国家的人民和美国本国国内的人民，也愈来愈反对对方所进行的不义战争。如果对方不顾全世界人民的反对，继续坚持扣留战俘的主张，蓄意继续乃至扩大朝鲜战争，彻底的失败将是对方的结局。双方代表团大会在对方建议下，再次休会七天，九月二十日复会。
