Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th. The International Democratic Women's Federation will soon convene the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing. The International Democratic Women's Federation has issued a letter to the women of Asian and Pacific Regions, the full text of which is as follows:

The greatest tragedy for a mother—losing the one she loves, losing her children—is befalling millions of you.

Mothers in Korea, mothers in Vietnam, mothers in Malaya are living in the terror of terrible war, in agony every minute; their children are being burned by napalm, destroyed by constant bombing. Germ warfare is threatening countless people; this war is spreading plague, cholera, typhoid, and all kinds of the most terrible diseases against which millions of you are powerless to protect your children. Mothers in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Latin American countries are trembling, fearing that their sons will be taken away; how many mothers have already cried for their sons!

Entire populations are starving, terrible famines are spreading, but at the same time, vast wealth and the strength of millions are being used for war. Food and clothing are lacking; huge sums of money are collected to build armaments and strategic bases; many countries cannot establish free trade relations, causing great suffering and poverty. Aggressive treaties are bringing heavy war burdens to the people and forcing them to accept the occupation of foreign troops.

This situation threatens to deepen the hatred between peoples, and it is harmful to building a future that should be one of reconciliation and friendship.

Only a small handful of people get rich from war and are interested in starting wars. But millions and millions of people yearn for a peaceful life.

Women and mothers love their own children and the children of other mothers. When you defend your children, you are also protecting the children of all mothers.

The desire of the people of your country for peace will be affirmed at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. You will send your representatives to this conference. You will participate in this conference in order to make the voices of your children heard by all with your own voices. You can call on all the women around you today to take action as early as possible to help ensure the success of this conference.

If women all over the world take action together, they can eliminate war and open up a safe and happy future for their children.

On behalf of 135 million women in 65 countries, we express our full support for you and are convinced that women and mothers, together with all the people, will be victorious in the struggle for peace, freedom, and happiness.

    国际民主妇女联合会发表
    致亚洲及太平洋区域各国妇女书
    【新华社十五日讯】柏林消息：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在北京召开，国际民主妇女联合会特发表致亚洲及太平洋区域各国妇女书，全文如下：
    作为一个母亲的最大的惨痛——失去她所爱的人，失去她的儿女——正降落在你们千万人的身上。
    朝鲜的母亲们、越南的母亲们、马来亚的母亲们，都正生活在可怕的战争的恐怖里，每分钟都在痛苦中；她们的儿女被凝固汽油弹燃烧，被不断的轰炸而消灭。细菌战正威胁着无数人民，这种战争正在散播鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒以及各种你们千万人无力保护你们的儿女的最可怕的疾病。美国、澳大利亚、加拿大以及拉丁美洲国家的母亲们都在颤抖，恐惧她们的儿子会被拉走；多少个母亲已经在为她们的儿子而哭泣了啊！
    整批的人民在挨饥受饿，可怕的饥荒在蔓延，但同时庞大的财富和千万人的力量却正被用于战争。粮食和衣服缺乏；巨额款项被搜集用于建立武装和战略基地；许多国家不能建立自由贸易关系，而造成巨大痛苦和贫困。侵略性的条约正给人民带来沉重的战争负担，并强迫人民接受外国军队的占领。
    这种情况威胁着将加深各国人民之间的憎恨，这种情况对于建立应该是和好与友爱的将来，是有害的。
    只有一小撮的人从战争中发财，并有兴趣发动战争。但是千千万万人都渴望过和平的生活。
    妇女和母亲们都爱她们自己的儿女和其他母亲的儿女。你们保卫你们的儿女，同时也就在保护所有母亲的儿女。
    你们国家的人民对和平的愿望，将在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议中得到肯定的答复。你们将派遣你们的代表出席这个会议。你们将参加这个会议，是为了要用你们自己的声音使大家都听见你们的儿女的呼声。你们可以在今天呼吁你们周围的一切妇女及早采取行动，以帮助保证这个会议的成功。
    全世界的妇女们一致采取行动，就可以消灭战争，并给一切妇女开辟出使她们的儿女安全幸福的前途。
    我们代表六十五个国家的一亿三千五百万妇女，表示完全支持你们，并深信妇女和母亲们和全体人民一道，将在争取和平、自由、幸福的斗争中得到胜利。
