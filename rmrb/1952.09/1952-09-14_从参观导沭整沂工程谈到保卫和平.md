    From Visiting the Guide-Shu-Manage-Yi Project to Defending Peace
    Xu Beihong, President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts

    Last spring, I had the opportunity to visit the Guide-Shu-Manage-Yi Project in Shandong. This massive water conservancy project was undertaken by the People's Government immediately after the liberation of southern Shandong, before the end of the Huaihai Campaign. Because of the harm caused by the Shu and Yi rivers, more than five million people in central and southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu had been homeless in the past, and more than twelve million mu of fertile land had become swamps. In order to eliminate this disaster that had lasted for nearly ten centuries, the People's Government decided to divert the water of the Shu and Yi rivers into the sea. This required diverting the Shu River through the Sha River into the Linhong River, and from the Linhong River into the sea, a total length of about 140 li; and excavating a new Yi River in northern Jiangsu, more than 200 kilometers long, so that the water of the Yi River would no longer flow into the Grand Canal but directly into the sea. In this way, not only was the flood eliminated, but the nearby farmland was irrigated. This huge project, which turned water disaster into water conservancy, has been carried out by Shandong and Jiangsu provinces since 1948, in two phases each year, in late spring and cold winter, mobilizing hundreds of thousands of laborers each phase, lasting five years, and has now been completed successfully. I saw with my own eyes the arduous and organized labor of hundreds of thousands of people concentrated in this area. In order to divert the Shu River into the Sha River, it was necessary to remove a section of the Maling Mountain, 13 li long, and dig it into a river channel. I saw countless laborers using their hands, a pickaxe and a hoe, to open mountains and chisel stones, which reminded me of the fable of the Old Man Who Moved Mountains. Each of them was full of labor enthusiasm, with the confidence that man can conquer nature, working bravely and happily, and countless heroes, models, and inventors emerged from them. Visiting this great project was like entering a labor university. The disaster area, which was once scarred, has now become tens of thousands of acres of fertile land. From this, we can see the determination of the People's Government to lead peaceful construction and the desire of the broad masses of people for peace. For the sake of a peaceful and happy life, they transformed nature and also transformed themselves. This not only demonstrates determination and desire, but also shows the greatness of the forces of peace.
    Water conservancy projects on an even larger scale than the Guide-Shu-Manage-Yi Project are being carried out throughout our country, such as the Huai River project, the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, and the Guanting Reservoir. The modern, huge Jingjiang River flood diversion project was completed in less than three months. This shows that our country's fresh troops for peaceful construction are growing stronger day by day. They are also a strong force for defending peace. Because people who have the confidence and strength to engage in peaceful construction also have the confidence and strength to defend the fruits of their peaceful construction.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to be convened, which is a sign that the people of the Asian and Pacific regions have the confidence to defend peace. Let the peace-loving people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions unite closely, smash the war schemes of the bellicose aggressors, defend their peaceful lives, and carry out their peaceful construction on a larger scale!

    从参观导沭整沂工程谈到保卫和平
    中央美术学院院长　徐悲鸿
    去年春天我得有机缘参观山东导沭整沂工程。这是紧接着鲁南刚刚解放，淮海战役尚未结束，人民政府即着手兴建的巨大水利工程。因沭河、沂河为害，鲁中南和苏北过去有五百余万人民无家可归，一千二百万亩以上良田变成沼泽。人民政府为了消除这绵延将达十个世纪的灾害，决定引沭河、沂河之水入海。这需要将沭河改道经沙河入临洪河，从临洪河入海，全长约一百四十华里；另在苏北开凿一条长二百余公里的新沂河，使沂河的水不再流入运河而直接入海。这样一来，不仅消除了水患，而附近农田皆得灌溉。这个把水患化为水利的巨大工程，自一九四八年起，以山东、江苏两省之力，不违农时，每年分春末与寒冬两期开工，每期动员民工数十万人，历时五年，至今年已全部胜利完工。我亲眼看到了集中在这块地区的数十万群众进行的有组织的艰巨的劳动。为了要把沭河引入沙河，须将马岭山的一段长达十三华里的石岩移去，凿成一条河道。我看到无数民工用双手一镐一镢开山凿石，使我想起愚公移山的寓言。他们一个个充满了劳动热情，抱着人定胜天的信心，勇敢愉快地工作着，其中涌现出无数英雄模范和发明创造者。我参观了这一伟大工程，等于进了一次劳动大学。昔日是满目疮痍的灾区，今日已变成良田万顷。从这一件事可看出人民政府领导和平建设的决心和广大人民爱好和平的愿望。为了和平幸福的生活，他们改造了自然，也改造了自己。这不仅表现了决心与愿望，也显示出和平力量的伟大。
    比之导沭整沂工程规模更大的水利事业正在我国各地开展：如治淮、荆江分洪、官厅水库等等。近代化的、巨大的荆江分洪工程，不到三个月就完成了。这说明我国和平建设的生力军正在一天天成长壮大。他们也是坚强的保卫和平的力量。因为有信心有力量从事和平建设的人们，也是有信心有力量来保卫自己的和平建设的成果的。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将召开了，这是亚洲及太平洋区域人民有信心保卫和平的标志。亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平的人们紧密地团结起来，粉碎好战的侵略者的战争阴谋，保卫自己的和平生活，更大规模地开展自己的和平建设吧！
