The Secretariat of the International Student Union recently issued a message to students in the Asia and Pacific region, calling on them to participate in the Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The message to students stated: Dear friends and students in the Asia and Pacific region!

A serious threat looms over us all. World public opinion is very concerned about the international tension. The hope of the people of all countries for a ceasefire in Korea has not yet been realized, and negotiations are being delayed, while American planes are constantly bombing non-military targets indiscriminately. The public is expressing great anger at the use of bacteriological weapons. The bloody colonial wars in Malaya and Vietnam are still raging fiercely, still destroying countless lives. Some people, disregarding the wishes of more than one billion Asian people—including the Japanese people—are systematically supporting aggressive Japanese militarism.

Indeed, world peace has never been threatened as seriously in recent years as it is today. This situation has brought more pain and burden to the people and students of all countries, and to the people and students of the Asia and Pacific region. Under the threat of world war, the already difficult situation of students in most countries in this region has now deteriorated further. Recognizing the importance of world peace, more and more students in these regions are participating in the struggle for peace. In fact, today they have become an important force in their people's struggle for freedom, national independence, and peace.

The power of the people of the world is sufficient to stop war. The more than 500 million signatures on the Stockholm Appeal demanding the banning of atomic bombs stopped the use of atomic bombs in Korea. The demand for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact has been supported by one-third of humanity. There is no doubt that when increasingly broad strata of people in various regions participate in anti-war activities, peace can be saved, and the happy life of the younger generation is guaranteed.

The declaration issued by the Preparatory Meeting of the Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, calling for the Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in September 1952, is in the interests of the people of these regions. They still clearly remember the terror and pain they suffered under the occupation of Japanese fascists during the last World War, and they do not want these events to be repeated. They want to live a free life, free from any oppression and free from the threat of the shadow of war, under the sunshine of peace. Writers, artists, doctors, legal workers, scientists, and other social celebrities have expressed their support and willingness to cooperate. Broadly representative preparatory committees have been established in all these countries to ensure participation in this conference.

The International Student Union is deeply aware of the great significance of this Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and is very pleased to see that students in these countries are already actively participating in the domestic preparatory work. The International Student Union further urges these students to intensify their activities in the struggle for peace.

Students of the Asia and Pacific region!

Unite! Understand the significance of the Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference! Organize broad discussions in middle schools, colleges, universities, and hospitals, in every place where there are students. Organize a national discussion on peace issues among the students in your country! Express solidarity with the Japanese students' struggle against the resurgence of militarism, send telegrams and letters to support them! Send telegrams and letters to each other, support each other, and consolidate your unity in the struggle for peace! Launch a systematic campaign to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact—on an even broader scale! Demand an immediate end to the Korean War.

Forward to the Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference!

### 国际学联发表告亚洲及太平洋区域学生书  号召各国学生积极参加和平会议筹备工作

    国际学联发表告亚洲及太平洋区域学生书
    号召各国学生积极参加和平会议筹备工作
    【新华社三十日讯】国际学生联合会秘书处最近发表告亚洲及太平洋区域学生书，号召他们参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。告学生书说：亲爱的亚洲及太平洋区域的朋友们和学生们！
    一个严重的威胁笼罩在我们大家头上。全世界的舆论对于国际紧张局势很表关心。各国人民要求朝鲜停战的希望还没有实现，而谈判却被拖延着，美国飞机经常对非军事目标滥施轰炸。公众对细菌武器的被拿出来使用表示十分愤怒。马来亚和越南境内的血腥的殖民战争还在激烈地进行，还在毁灭无数的生命。有人悍然不顾十亿以上的亚洲人民——其中包括日本人民——的意愿，正在有计划地扶植侵略性的日本军国主义。
    的确，近年来世界和平还没有受到过像今天这样严重的威胁。这种局势给各国人民和学生，给亚洲及太平洋区域的人民和学生带来了更多的痛苦和负担。在世界大战的威胁下，这个地区大多数国家的学生们的本来已经很困难的处境现在更加恶化了。由于认识到世界和平的重要性，这些地区参加和平斗争的学生越来越多了。事实上，今天他们已成为他们的人民争取自由、民族独立与和平的斗争中的一个重要力量。
    全世界人民的力量是足以制止战争的。他们在要求禁用原子弹的斯德哥尔摩宣言上的五亿多签名，制止了在朝鲜使用原子弹的行为。缔结五大国和平公约的要求已经得到了三分之一的人类的拥护。毫无疑问，当各地人民中越来越广泛的阶层参加了反战活动时，和平是可以拯救的，年青一代的幸福生活是有保证的。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议发表的宣言，号召在一九五二年九月间在北京召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，这个宣言是符合这些地区的人民的利益的。他们还清楚地记得上次世界大战期间在日本法西斯占领下所遭受的恐怖和痛苦，他们不希望这些事件重演。他们要在和平阳光的普照下过自由的、不受任何压迫、不受战争阴影威胁的生活。作家、艺术家、医生、法律工作者、科学家以及其他社会名流都表示了支持并愿意合作，所有这些国家中都成立了有广泛代表性的筹备委员会，以保证能够参加这次会议。
    国际学生联合会深深知道这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的伟大意义，而且看到这些国家的学生已经在积极参加国内所进行的筹备工作，感到非常满意。国际学生联合会进一步要求这些学生加紧他们的争取和平的活动。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的学生们！
    团结起来！了解亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的意义！在中学、学院、大学及医院、在每一个有学生的地方组织广泛的讨论。在你们国家的学生中间组织一次关于和平问题的全国性讨论！对日本学生的反对重新军国主义化斗争表示声援，打电报、写信声援他们！在你们彼此之间互拍电报、互相通信，互相声援，巩固你们在争取和平的斗争中的团结！开展一个有步骤的要求缔结五大国和平公约的运动——在更加广泛的规模上开展！要求立即停止朝鲜战争。
    向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议前进！
