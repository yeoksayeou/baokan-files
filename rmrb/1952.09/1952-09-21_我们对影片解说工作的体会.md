    Our Experiences with Film Narration

    To the Editor: Regarding the work of explaining film content, our Rehe Province China-Soviet Friendship Association Film Projection Team has the following experiences:

    1. Before the film is shown, the central content of the film should be briefly explained to the masses. The introduction time should not be too long, at most six or seven minutes, so as not to make the masses feel impatient.

    2. During the screening, seize appropriate gaps (such as when there is no dialogue from the film characters or when the music is not loud) to introduce the characters in the film and the plot of each shot. To do this well, the narrator must be familiar with and understand each shot. It is best to complete the brief explanation just as the shot is about to appear or has already appeared.

    3. In order to avoid conflicting with the film's sound or dialogue, we do not use a microphone, but rather hold a megaphone behind or near the screen to explain to the audience. This does not prevent the audience from listening to the characters' dialogue in the film. Based on our past experience, when choosing a screening venue, we generally hang the screen according to the wind direction, so that the sound blows towards the audience, allowing everyone to hear the film's sound clearly. This way, in venues with five or six thousand audience members, the sound is generally audible.

    4. When explaining, it is also important to pay attention to the plot and the emotions of the characters in the film, and not just speak dryly.

    Doing a good job in film narration is the main way to help the audience understand the film. Because the film team mainly shows films in rural areas, using subtitles or distributing leaflets is not only uneconomical, but also only a few literate people can understand them, which is of no help to most viewers.

    我们对影片解说工作的体会
    编辑同志：我们热河省中苏友好协会电影放映队在解说影片内容工作方面，有以下几点体会：
    一、在影片放映前，应向群众扼要地解释影片的中心内容。介绍时间不应太长，顶多六、七分钟，不要使群众感到不耐烦。
    二、在放映时，抓住适当空隙（如不是影片人物对话和音乐声响不大的时候），介绍影片中的人物和每个镜头的情节。要做好这项工作，讲解者必须熟悉和了解每个镜头，最好在镜头刚要出现或已出现时，便简短地解说完了。
    三、为了避免和影片的声音或对话冲突，我们不是使用麦克风，而是拿着广播筒到银幕后边或附近向群众解说，这样不妨碍观众去听影片中人物的对话。根据我们过去的经验，在选择放映场所时，一般都是按照风向张挂银幕，使声音向着观众这方面刮，让大家能清楚地听见影片的声音。这样通常在五、六千观众的场所里，一般都听得见。
    四、在解说时，还要注意影片中的情节和人物的感情，不要枯燥地说下去。
    做好影片解说工作，是帮助观众看懂电影的主要办法。因为电影队主要是在农村放映电影，如用字幕解说或散发说明书，非但不经济，而且只有少数识字的人能看懂，对大多数观众没有什么帮助。
