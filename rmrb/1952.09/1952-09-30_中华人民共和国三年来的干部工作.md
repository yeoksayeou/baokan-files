    The People's Republic of China's Cadre Work in the Past Three Years
    An Ziwen, Minister of Personnel of the Central People's Government

    The People's Republic of China has been established for three years. Over the past three years, China's work in all aspects has greatly developed, and the struggles on all fronts have continued to achieve new victories. With the development of work in all aspects and the victories of struggles on all fronts, cadre work has also been advancing rapidly.

    The first achievement of cadre work in the past three years has been the great development in the number of cadres. On October 1, 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, there were a total of 720,000 cadres of various types throughout the country, excluding the military system. Now (as of September 20, 1952), the total number of cadres has grown to 2.75 million, which is almost four times the total number of cadres three years ago.

    These newly added cadres mainly came from the following aspects: First, a large number of active workers and peasants were discovered, cultivated, and promoted to become new cadres in various movements and struggles. Second, graduates from universities and secondary vocational schools participated in construction work in various fields under the unified allocation or guidance of the state; in addition, at the beginning of liberation, we also absorbed a large number of college and middle school students, provided them with short-term training, and assigned them to various jobs. Third, a large number of old intellectuals were recruited and trained from society.

    2.75 million cadres are a large force. It is precisely because we have such a large cadre army that we can carry out work in all aspects and achieve victories in struggles on all fronts. However, our country is a large country with a population of 475 million. In order to carry out new struggles, especially in order to achieve victories in large-scale economic construction and other aspects of construction, we must continue to absorb reserve forces from workers, peasants, young intellectuals, and various talents in society to make this cadre army even stronger.

    The second achievement of cadre work in the past three years has been the large-scale work of cultivating and training cadres.

    One of the main ways to cultivate and train cadres is through regular school education. In the past three years, a total of more than 66,000 students have graduated from universities, the vast majority of whom have obeyed the unified allocation of the state. Taking the summer of 1951 as an example, there were a total of 15,749 graduates, and 15,643 obeyed the unified allocation, accounting for 99.4% of the total number of graduates. The focus of allocating university graduates is on economic construction departments, especially factories and mines. Of the more than 27,000 students who graduated in the summer of 1952, more than 16,000 were assigned to economic construction departments, accounting for 59% of all graduates, of which more than 12,000 were directly assigned to basic construction jobs in factories and mines, accounting for 46% of all graduates. Graduates of secondary vocational schools have not yet been allocated by the state in a unified manner, but they have also participated in construction work in various fields under the guidance of local governments. The characteristics of these young intellectual cadres are that they are full of vigor, enthusiastic about work, and actively study their professions and technologies. After a period of practical training and ideological transformation, most of them have become lower-level backbones in various departments.

    In addition to regular schools, various business departments have also held a large number of professional cadre schools and training courses. The Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government alone trained more than 11,200 cadres in 1951. The various professional cadre schools and training courses held by the central and local water conservancy departments have enrolled more than 13,000 students in the past three years, with more than 6,400 graduates. Although these cadre schools and training courses have a short training period, they have achieved good results because the content is concentrated and the courses studied are closely integrated with actual needs, and they have greatly solved the urgent need for cadres in various business departments.

    In addition, people's revolutionary universities have been opened all over the country, mainly for ideological transformation. In the past three years, nearly 100,000 students have graduated from people's revolutionary universities across the country.

    In the past three years, we have also done a lot of very important work in cultivating and improving existing cadres. In order to train cadres with certain work experience into specialized talents for national construction, the Central People's Government has opened a new type of regular university with cadres as the main training object—Renmin University. This school has trained more than 2,600 cadres in 1951 and 1952, more than 95% of whom were transferred from various jobs to study at the school. At the same time, some places have also opened similar schools. For the same purpose, in the summer of 1952, we transferred more than 15,300 cadres with a high school education to universities.

    The even larger scale is the rotational training of incumbent cadres. This method of rotational training is popular all over the country. In the past three years, more than 1.2 million cadres (including a considerable number of rural cadres) have received this training. The content of the training includes ideological and political education, policy education, and education on professional knowledge. After training, the vast majority of cadres have significantly improved their ideological awareness and policy level, thus further exerting their enthusiasm and creativity in their work and greatly promoting the work.

    Localities have also begun to pay attention to the issue of improving the cultural level of veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds. To solve this problem, some cultural supplementary schools and worker-peasant accelerated middle schools have been opened in various places. However, the number of such schools is still too small to meet the urgent demand of the vast number of cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds to learn culture, which needs to be further resolved in future work.

    The last important issue in the work of cultivating and training cadres is the issue of cultivating and improving cadres in their work positions. The gains in this area are also very significant. In addition to continuously improving the professional level of cadres by summarizing work experience, we have also paid special attention to the political and ideological education and theoretical education of cadres. In general, all staff members of state organs can study for one and a half to two hours every day. The content of the study is mainly the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese revolution. Some places have begun to systematically study the history of the Communist Party of China and the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. These studies are closely integrated with various political movements. In the past three years, a large number of cadres have participated in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the land reform movement, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the rectification movement, the ideological remolding movement, and the "three-anti" and "five-anti" movements. In these movements, they have generally been tempered and educated, and have further strengthened their people's stand and their determination to fight to the end for the cause of new democracy. The progress of some of them is particularly significant. Most of them have become backbones in practical work; some have assumed various leadership positions. However, it should be pointed out that this progress is not balanced, and the ideology of some people has not been thoroughly transformed. In particular, a part of the old intellectual cadres from the old society, the hired views, purely technical views, and tendencies not to ask about politics that they have cultivated under years of reactionary rule have not yet been completely overcome, which should be paid attention to and resolved in future work.

    The work of cultivating and training cadres is one of the most central tasks of cadre work. In the future, it is necessary to further improve planning in this work and carry it out on a larger scale.

    The third achievement of cadre work in the past three years has been the promotion of a large number of outstanding cadres to assume leadership positions in various fields. In particular, after the People's Daily published the editorial "Boldly Promote Cadres" in the later period of the "three-anti" movement, it aroused the attention of leading comrades at all levels to this issue and achieved significant results. According to incomplete statistics, the six major administrative regions of North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, East China, Central South China, and Southwest China promoted a total of more than 88,400 cadres in the few months after the "three-anti" movement, of which 5,649 were cadres at or above the county level (North China not included). In this way, not only was the shortage of cadres after the "three-anti" movement made up to a considerable extent, but also the work in all aspects was greatly strengthened.

    One of the important issues in the work of promoting cadres is the promotion of worker cadres. From the beginning of entering the city and taking over factories, we have paid great attention to the work of cultivating and promoting worker cadres. Later, through the democratic reform and production reform of enterprises, through the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, especially through the patriotic production increase movement and the "three-anti" and "five-anti" movements, the number of active elements among workers has greatly increased. On this basis, a large number of worker cadres have been promoted in various places. In the Northeast alone, more than 84,000 worker cadres have been cultivated and promoted in the past three years. These newly promoted worker cadres have a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, have close ties with the working masses, understand production technology, have practical operating experience, can go deep into the front line, rely on the masses, and solve practical problems in production, thus playing a significant role in the reform of enterprises and in the restoration and development of production.

    In order to implement the principle of "boldly promoting cadres," we have fought against the following erroneous ideological viewpoints: First, the conservative thought of not believing in new forces. The characteristic of this thought is not believing in the masses, not believing in the active elements emerging in various movements, not seeing the young outstanding cadres, and taking "seniority" as the main criterion when promoting cadres. Leaders with this kind of thinking can never discover and cultivate outstanding cadres in a timely manner. On the contrary, they hinder the growth of these cadres. Second, the departmentalism thought that does not take into account the overall situation and does not know the general situation. Leaders with this kind of thinking often think that their "work is special," think that the cadres of the department they lead can only be transferred in but not transferred out, and inappropriately emphasize the "vertical management" of cadres, resulting in the phenomenon that old cadres are overstocked and new cadres cannot be promoted. Third, simply emphasizing "culture" and "technology." Not being able to recognize cadres from their essence, emphasizing "talent" but not "morality," this kind of thinking has also greatly affected the promotion of cadres, especially the promotion of worker and peasant cadres. Fourth, the idea of not seriously carrying out the work of cultivating and promoting cadres, but waiting and relying on the higher authorities to send ready-made good cadres. The above-mentioned erroneous ideas and viewpoints have been strictly criticized. But in order to achieve greater success in the work of promoting cadres, it is necessary to continue to fight against these erroneous ideas and viewpoints.

    Years of experience have proved that the criteria for selecting cadres is an important issue. All those who have correctly grasped this criterion have achieved success in the work of cultivating and promoting cadres. Otherwise, there will inevitably be deviations and errors. Our only criterion for selecting cadres is the criterion of "both moral integrity and ability." "Morality" is a cadre's political character, and "ability" is a cadre's ability to undertake a certain kind of business work. The two must be combined and cannot be neglected. Any other criterion for selecting cadres that deviates from this criterion is incorrect.

    Localities have created a lot of experience in the methods of promoting cadres. The most basic experiences are: First, combining leadership with the masses; second, combining the work of promoting cadres with the regular, systematic, and in-depth understanding of cadre work; third, combining the work of promoting cadres with the cultivation, education, and specific assistance before and after promotion.

    Although the work of promoting cadres has achieved great success, we must not be satisfied with this. With the vigorous development of our country's various construction undertakings, the number of cadres needed will inevitably increase rapidly. The problem of insufficient cadres will still be a major problem in our country's construction for a considerable period of time. Therefore, in the future, we must continue to pay attention to discovering and cultivating outstanding cadres from various work departments and various movements, and boldly promote them to achieve greater success in this work.

    The fourth achievement of cadre work in the past three years has been the adjustment and allocation of cadres according to various political tasks; in particular, in the past year, a large number of cadres have been transferred to work in factories, mines, and enterprises, strengthening the leadership of factories, mines, and enterprises.

    Adjusting cadre forces according to political tasks is a consistent principle we adhere to in our cadre work. For example, in 1949, we transferred a large number of cadres from old areas to work in cities and new areas, and established the leading institutions of various departments of the Central People's Government. For example, in order to carry out land reform, we organized land reform work teams of about 300,000 people every year to lead the peasants in this earth-shaking great struggle. For example, we organized more than 40,000 cadres to participate in the Huai River control project, and organized nearly 5,000 cadres to participate in the Jingjiang River flood diversion project.

    In order to welcome the upcoming high tide of large-scale economic construction, since last year, all localities have, without exception, transferred a large number of outstanding cadres from other work positions to work in factories, mines, and enterprises. According to incomplete statistics, the total number of cadres transferred to factories, mines, and enterprises across the country in the past year reached more than 43,300, of which cadres at or above the county level accounted for more than one-tenth.

    In addition to cadres transferred from various work positions, a large number of young intellectuals have also been sent to work in factories, mines, and enterprises across the country in the past year. According to statistics from the five major regions of Northeast China, Northwest China, East China, Central South China, and Southwest China, nearly 15,000 young intellectuals have been sent to factories and mines in the past year.

    The investment of these forces in factories and mines has greatly promoted the restoration and development of factory and mine production. In particular, the role of veteran cadres is even greater. Because they have a firm stand, clear views, a certain level of Marxist-Leninist theory, rich experience in struggle, and organizational ability, and are good at contacting the masses, so although the vast majority of them have not done economic work, especially do not understand technology, after hard study and learning, most of them are able to be competent for the work they are undertaking. In the past, some people thought that veteran cadres could not lead factories, and only old personnel could run industry. Facts have proved that this view is completely wrong. In the future, with the development of large-scale economic construction, we must also transfer a larger number of veteran cadres to do economic work. We should understand that only by resolutely doing so can we guarantee the success of our country's industrial construction.

    In order to solve the difficulty that our country is currently very lacking in specialized technical talents, in addition to strengthening cultivation and training, we have also carried out the adjustment of specialized technical talents. For this reason, we must oppose departmentalism and oppose the phenomenon of wasting talents. This work is still in progress.

    The fifth achievement of cadre work in the past three years has been the gradual improvement of the material living standards of cadres and the gradual resolution of various difficulties in the lives of cadres.

    In the past, in the long revolutionary war, the material life of cadres was always extremely difficult. In the initial period after the establishment of the Central People's Government, on the one hand, we had to continue to support the revolutionary war, and on the other hand, we had to restore the national economy that had been destroyed by the long-term war, so the country's financial situation was still difficult. At that time, although the material life of cadres had been initially improved, it was generally still difficult. In the past three years, with the improvement of the country's financial and economic situation and the improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of people, the people's government has gradually improved the material living treatment of cadres.

    Before 1952, all regions and departments across the country had carried out more than one adjustment of cadres' wages, large and small, under the unified guidance of the Central People's Government. For example, the wages of cadres in central-level organs were adjusted once in September 1951, with an average increase of more than 11%; the Northeast region adjusted once in May 1951, with an average increase of 15%, and again in April 1952, with an average increase of 30% (including rent, water, and electricity). The supply standards, welfare expenses, and family subsidy grain for cadres on the supply system have also increased year by year, guaranteeing cadres a certain material living standard and considerably solving the special difficulties of their individuals and families.

    In March 1952, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the trial measures for uniformly increasing allowances for staff members on the supply system across the country. In July, it successively promulgated and approved the promulgation of the allowance and wage standard tables for staff members of people's governments at all levels, technical personnel of people's government organs, health technical personnel, literary and art personnel, news and publishing personnel, scientific research personnel, translators, and teachers and staff members of schools at all levels, so that the material treatment of staff members of our state organs began to become unified, and at the same time, it also marked a further improvement in the material life of cadres. Currently, the work of adjusting allowances and wages in various regions has either ended or is still in progress. But it can be expected that the general wage of cadres across the country will increase by 10% to 30% on the original basis, and individual regions may even reach more than 30%.

    In order to solve the problem of medical treatment for cadres' diseases, at the same time as promulgating the allowance and wage standards, the State Council of the Central People's Government also promulgated the "Instructions on Implementing Publicly Funded Medical Treatment and Prevention for State Staff Members of People's Governments, Parties, Groups, and Affiliated Institutions at All Levels Across the Country." The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has also formulated specific implementation measures based on these instructions. In addition, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government have also conducted specific research on cadres' welfare funds in accordance with the instructions of the State Council. According to this new regulation on cadres' welfare funds, the difficulties of some cadres with particularly heavy family burdens will also be basically resolved.

    Constantly improving the material living standards of the broad masses of people (including cadres) is one of the basic policies of our country. At present, there are still two systems of supply system and wage system in our cadres' material treatment; cadres' wages have only begun to increase, and the standards have only achieved preliminary unification; the methods of publicly funded medical treatment and prevention have only begun to be implemented; and there are still some other specific problems in the material life of cadres. These problems will be more properly resolved with the further development of the national economy. We believe that the material life of the vast number of cadres in our country will definitely improve step by step.

    The above are the main achievements of cadre work in the past three years. These achievements have been achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and through the hard work of leading comrades in various regions and departments. These achievements are great, but we must not forget the serious shortcomings in our work because of this. These shortcomings are mainly: First, the work of managing cadres has not been established in a regular and systematic way, and there is still a lack of regular, systematic, and in-depth understanding of cadres. Some leading comrades and cadre work departments still make decisions based on a "appraisal form" when assigning cadre work, and many "appraisal forms" often cannot appropriately represent all aspects of a cadre. Due to the lack of systematic and in-depth understanding of cadres, it is also easy to produce "seniority" as the main basis for understanding cadres. The weakest but most important link in the work of managing cadres is the work of managing cadres in industrial and mining enterprises. At present, this work has basically not been established in many places. With a large number of cadres transferred to industrial and mining enterprises, we must quickly strengthen this work, otherwise it will inevitably affect the country's industrial construction and will make serious mistakes. Second, the work of cultivating and improving veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds and women cadres has not been done enough. Some leading comrades and cadre work departments lack due concern for veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds and women cadres, and even take a contemptuous attitude towards them, disliking the low cultural level of veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds and disliking the trouble of women cadres. This attitude is obviously very wrong. The key issue in cultivating and improving veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds (including a considerable number of women cadres) is to improve their cultural level. Although we have started this work, it is still far from enough. In the future, we must seriously solve this problem within a certain period of time. The main obstacle to cultivating women cadres is that some male cadres still have discriminatory ideas against women, and many cadre work departments have not given due attention to the work of cultivating women cadres. This shortcoming must also be seriously overcome in future work. Third, the work of many cadre work departments is still very lacking in planning and initiative, there is a great deal of blindness and passivity, they are busy with daily affairs all day long, lack foresight, and do not consider major issues in their work enough. This has changed somewhat in recent years, but it should continue to be overcome. We believe that the above-mentioned shortcomings and other shortcomings can be completely overcome through serious and hard work, and we have every reason to expect that our country's cadre work will achieve even greater achievements.

    中华人民共和国三年来的干部工作
    中央人民政府人事部部长  安子文
    中华人民共和国成立已经三周年了。三年以来，我国各方面的工作都有了巨大的发展，各个战线上的斗争都在不断取得新的胜利。随着各方面工作的发展和各个战线上斗争的胜利，干部工作也在飞速地前进着。
    三年来干部工作的第一个成就，是在干部的数量上有很大的发展。一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立的时候，全国除军事系统外共有各种干部七十二万人，到现在（截至一九五二年九月二十日为止）干部总数已发展到二百七十五万人，差不多等于三年前干部总数的四倍。
    新增加的这些干部主要是由以下几个方面来的：一、在各种运动和各种斗争中发现，培养和提拔了大量的工农积极分子成为新的干部。二、高等学校和中等专业学校毕业的学生在国家的统一分配或指导下参加了各方面的建设工作；此外，在解放初期，我们还吸收了一大批大、中学生，予以短期训练后，分配到各种工作岗位上去。三、从社会上招收训练了一大批旧知识分子。
    二百七十五万干部是一个很大的队伍，正因为我们有这样一支干部大军，才能进行了各方面的工作，取得各个战线上斗争的胜利。但是我们的国家是一个四亿七千五百万人口的大国，为了进行新的斗争，特别是为了取得大规模的经济建设以及其他方面建设的胜利，我们还必须不断地从工、农群众中，从青年知识分子中，从社会上各种各样的人材中吸取后备力量，使这一支干部大军更加壮大起来。
    三年来干部工作的第二个成就，是进行了大规模的培养、训练干部的工作。
    培养、训练干部的主要方式之一是正规学校的教育。三年来，高等学校毕业的学生共有六万六千余人，其中绝大部分服从了国家的统一分配。以一九五一年暑期为例，共有毕业学生一万五千七百四十九人，服从统一分配的是一万五千六百四十三人，占毕业生总数的百分之九十九点四。分配高等学校毕业学生的重点是经济建设部门，特别是工厂、矿山。一九五二年暑期毕业的两万七千多学生中，分配到经济建设部门的有一万六千多人，占全体毕业学生的百分之五十九，其中直接分配到工厂、矿山的基本建设工作岗位上去的有一万二千多人，占全体毕业学生的百分之四十六。中等专业学校的毕业生目前还未做到由国家统一分配，但也都在当地政府指导下参加了各方面的建设工作。这些青年知识分子干部的特点是富有朝气、工作热情，积极钻研业务和技术，经过一定时间的实际锻炼和思想改造之后，他们多已成为各部门工作中的下层骨干。
    除正规学校外，各业务部门还举办了大量的专业干部学校和训练班。仅中央人民政府铁道部、农业部、财政部等十个部门，在一九五一年内即训练了一万一千二百多个干部。中央和地方的水利部门举办的各种专业干部学校和训练班，三年来即招收学员一万三千余人，毕业学员六千四百余人。这些干部学校和训练班虽然进行训练的时间较短，但因内容集中，所学的课程与实际需要结合密切，所以也收到了很好的效果，大量地解决了各个业务部门对于干部的迫切需要。
    此外全国各地还都开办了一种以进行思想改造为主要目的的学校，这就是各地的人民革命大学。三年来从各地人民革命大学毕业出来的学员约近十万人。
    三年来，对于现有干部的培养提高我们也做了很多很重要的工作。为了把已有一定工作经验的干部培养成为国家建设的专门人材，中央人民政府开办了一个以干部为主要训练对象的新型的正规大学——人民大学。这个学校在一九五一、一九五二两年中共培养出两千六百多干部，其中百分之九十五以上是从各种工作岗位上抽调到学校来学习的。同时有些地方也开办了类似这样的学校。为了同样的目的，在一九五二年暑期我们抽调了一万五千三百多名具有高中文化程度的干部升入了高等学校。
    规模更为巨大的是在职干部的轮训。这种轮训的办法普及全国各地，三年来受过这种训练的干部（其中包括相当一部分乡村干部）共有一百二十多万人。训练的内容包括思想、政治教育、政策教育和业务知识的教育。绝大多数干部经过训练以后，在思想觉悟和政策水平上都有显著的提高，因而进一步发挥了他们工作上的积极性和创造性，对工作起了极大的推动作用。
    对于提高工农出身的老干部文化程度的问题，各地也已开始注意。为了解决这个问题，各地都开办了一些文化补习学校和工农速成中学。但这种学校的数目目前还是太少，远不能满足广大工农出身的干部学习文化的迫切要求，这是需要在今后工作中进一步加以解决的。
    培养训练干部工作中最后的一个重要问题是在工作岗位上培养提高干部的问题，这一方面的收获也是很显著的。除了从总结工作经验中不断提高干部的业务水平以外，我们还特别注意了对干部的政治思想教育和理论教育。全体国家机关的工作人员一般的每日都能进行一小时半到两小时的学习，学习的内容主要是马克思列宁主义和中国革命的基本知识，有些地方则开始系统地进行中国共产党党史和毛泽东选集的学习。这些学习又是与各种政治运动密切结合进行的。三年来，有广大的干部参加了抗美援朝运动、土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动、整风运动、思想改造运动和“三反”“五反”运动。在这些运动中，他们普遍地受到了锻炼和教育，进一步坚定了人民的立场和为新民主主义事业奋斗到底的决心。其中一部分人的进步特别显著，他们多已成为实际工作中的骨干；有些则担负了各种领导职务。但应该指出，这种进步是并不平衡的，有一些人的思想还改造得很不彻底。特别是一部分从旧社会来的旧知识分子干部，他们在多年的反动统治下所养成的雇佣观点、单纯技术观点和不问政治的倾向，至今还没有得到完全克服，这是应该在今后的工作中注意加以解决的。
    培养、训练干部的工作是干部工作的最中心的任务之一。今后在这一工作上，需要更加提高计划性，使它在更广大的规模上开展起来。
    三年来干部工作的第三个成就，是提拔了一大批优秀的干部担负了多方面的领导职务。特别是在“三反”运动后期人民日报发表了《大胆放手提拔干部》的社论以后，更引起了各级领导同志对这一问题的重视，因而取得了重大的成绩。据不完全的统计，华北、东北、西北、华东、中南、西南六个大行政区在“三反”运动后几个月的时间内，共提拔干部八万八千四百余人，其中县级以上的干部即有五千六百四十九人（缺华北）。这样，就不但在相当程度上补足了“三反”后的干部缺额，而且大大加强了各方面的工作。
    提拔干部工作中的重要问题之一是提拔工人干部。从开始进入城市、接管工厂的时候起，我们就十分注意培养和提拔工人干部的工作。以后经过企业的民主改革和生产改革，经过抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动，特别是经过爱国增产运动和“三反”“五反”运动，工人中积极分子的数量更大大增加。在这样的基楚上各地都提拔了大量的工人干部。仅东北一地三年来即培养和提拔工人干部八万四千余人。这些新提拔的工人干部具有高度的革命热情，和工人群众有着密切的联系，懂得生产技术，有实际操作经验，能够深入现场，依靠群众，解决生产中的实际问题，因而对企业的改革、对恢复和发展生产，起了重大的作用。
    为了贯彻“大胆放手提拔干部”的方针，我们曾对这样一些错误的思想观点进行了斗争：一、不相信新生力量的保守思想。这种思想的特点就是不相信群众，不相信各种运动中涌现出来的积极分子，看不见年轻的优秀干部，在提拔干部时以“资历”为主要标准。具有这种思想的领导者绝不可能及时发现和培养后起的优秀干部，相反地是阻碍这些干部的生长。二、不顾全局不识大体的本位主义思想。具有这种思想的领导者往往认为自己的“工作特殊”，认为自己所领导的这一部门的干部，只能调进，不能调出，不适当地强调对干部的“垂直管理”，结果形成老干部积压甚多，而新干部则提拔不起来的现象。三、单纯强调“文化”和“技术”。对干部不能从本质上去认识，重“才”不重“德”，这种思想也大大地影响了对干部的提拔，特别是影响了对工农干部的提拔。四、不去认真进行培养提拔干部的工作，而等待、依赖上级派现成的好干部的思想。上述这些错误的思想和观点，都已受到了严格的批判。但为了在提拔干部工作上取得更大的成绩，还必须向这些错误的思想、观点继续进行斗争。
    多年的经验证明，选择干部的标准是一个重要的问题。凡是正确的掌握了这个标准的，培养和提拔干部的工作就有成绩，反之，就一定会发生偏差和错误。我们选择干部的唯一标准就是“德才兼备”的标准，“德”就是一个干部的政治品质，“才”就是一个干部担负某一种业务工作的能力，两者必须结合而不可偏废。离开这个标准的任何其他选择干部的标准，都是不正确的。
    提拔干部的方法，各地都创造了很多经验，其中最基本的经验是：一、领导与群众相结合；二、提拔干部工作与经常性的系统深入的了解干部工作相结合；三、提拔干部工作与提拔前后的培养、教育、具体帮助相结合。
    提拔干部工作虽已取得很大成绩，但我们绝不可因此而满足。随着我们国家各项建设事业的猛烈发展，需要干部的数量也必然要迅速增加，干部不足的问题在相当长的时间内仍然会是我们国家建设中的一个重大问题。因此今后必须继续注意从各个工作部门中，从各种运动中，认真发现和培养优秀的干部，并大胆地加以提拔，使这一工作取得更大的成就。
    三年来干部工作的第四个成就，是根据各项政治任务而调整和配备了干部；特别是在近一年来抽调了大批干部到工厂、矿山、企业部门中去工作，加强了工厂、矿山、企业的领导。
    根据政治任务而调整干部力量是我们干部工作中一贯遵守的原则。例如：一九四九年，我们曾从老区抽调了一大批干部到城市和新区工作，并建立起中央人民政府各部门的领导机构。例如：为了进行土地改革，我们曾每年组织了约三十万人的土地改革工作队，领导农民进行了这一个翻天复地的伟大斗争。例如：我们组织了四万多干部参加治淮工程，组织了近五千干部参加了荆江分洪工程。
    为了迎接即将到来的大规模的经济建设高潮，从去年开始，各地都无例外地从其他工作岗位上抽调了大批优秀的干部转入工厂、矿山、企业中去工作。根据不完全的统计，全国一年来转入工、矿、企业的干部总数达四万三千三百余人，其中县级以上的干部占十分之一以上。
    除了从各种工作岗位上抽调的干部以外，一年来全国各地还输送了大批青年知识分子到工厂、矿山和企业部门中去工作。据东北、西北、华东、中南、西南五个大区的统计，一年来输送到厂矿企业的青年知识分子近一万五千人。
    把这些力量投入到工厂、矿山后，对厂矿生产的恢复和发展起了极大的推动作用。特别是老干部起的作用更大。因为他们的立场坚定、观点明确，有一定的马克思列宁主义理论水平，有丰富的斗争经验和组织能力，并且善于联系群众，所以虽然他们之中绝大多数人并没有作过经济工作，尤其是不懂得技术，但经过艰苦的钻研和学习之后，多数人对自己所担负的工作是能够胜任的。过去有人认为老干部不能领导工厂，只有旧人员才能办工业。事实已证明这种观点是完全错误的。今后随着大规模经济建设的开展，我们还必须抽调更大量的老干部去作经济工作。我们应该了解，只有坚决这样作，才能保证我国工业建设的成功。
    为了解决我国目前十分缺乏专门技术人材的困难，除加强培养训练外，我们还进行了专门技术人材的调整工作。为此，就必须反对本位主义，反对浪费人材的现象，现在这一工作还在继续进行中。
    三年来干部工作的第五个成就，是逐步提高了干部的物质生活水平，逐步解决了干部生活上的各种困难。
    过去在长期的革命战争中，干部的物质生活一贯是极其艰苦的。在中央人民政府成立后的初期，我们一方面要继续支持革命战争，一方面又要恢复因长期战争而破坏了的国民经济，所以国家的财政情况仍然是困难的。那时干部的物质生活虽已有初步改善，但一般来说还是艰苦的。三年来，随着国家财政经济情况的好转，广大人民生活程度的提高，人民政府也就逐步提高了对干部的物质生活待遇。
    一九五二年以前，全国各地区各部门，在中央人民政府的统一指导下，对干部的工资都曾进行过不止一次的大小不等的调整。例如：中央一级机关干部的工资，在一九五一年九月曾进行过一次调整，平均增加了百分之十一以上；东北地区，在一九五一年五月调整一次，平均增加百分之十五，一九五二年四月又调整一次，平均增加百分之三十（包括房租、水、电费）。供给制干部的供给标准、福利费、家属补助粮等逐年也都有增加，保证了干部一定的物质生活水平，并相当地解决了他们个人和家庭的特殊困难。
    中央人民政府政务院在一九五二年三月颁发了全国供给制工作人员统一增加津贴的试行办法，七月又先后颁发和批准颁发了各级人民政府工作人员、人民政府机关技术人员、卫生技术人员、文艺人员、新闻出版人员、科学研究人员、翻译人员、各级学校教职员工等津贴和工资标准表，使我们国家机关工作人员的物质待遇开始走上统一，同时，也标志着干部物质生活进一步的改善。现在各地区调整津贴和工资的工作，有的已经结束，有的还正在进行。但可以预计，全国干部工资一般将在原有基础上提高百分之十到百分之三十，而个别地区还可能达到百分之三十以上。
    为了解决干部的疾病医疗问题，在颁发津贴和工资标准的同时，中央人民政府政务院又颁发了“关于全国各级人民政府、党派、团体及所属事业单位的国家工作人员实行公费医疗预防的指示”。中央人民政府卫生部并根据此项指示制定了实施的具体办法。此外，中央人民政府财政部和人事部又按照政务院的指示，对干部的福利经费作了具体研究。根据这一新的关于干部福利经费的规定，一部分家庭负担特别沉重的干部的困难也将会得到基本上的解决。
    不断提高广大人民（包括干部在内）的物质生活水平，是我们国家的基本政策之一。目前我们干部的物质待遇还存在着供给制和工资制的两种制度；干部的工资只是开始提高，标准只做到了初步统一；公费医疗和预防的办法也只是开始实行；干部的物质生活还存在着一些其他具体问题。这些问题都将随着国家经济进一步的发展而获得更为妥善的解决，我们相信我国广大干部的物质生活一定会一步一步地更加提高起来。
    以上这些，就是三年来干部工作的主要成就。这些成就都是在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，经过各地区、各部门领导同志的努力工作而取得的。这些成就是巨大的，但我们绝不能因此而忘记了我们工作中的严重缺点。这些缺点主要是：一、管理干部的工作还没有正规地系统地建立起来，对干部还缺乏经常性的系统深入的了解。有些领导同志和干部工作部门在分配干部工作时还只是根据一张“鉴定表”来作决定，而很多“鉴定表”又往往并不能适当地代表一个干部各方面的情况。由于对干部缺乏系统深入的了解，所以又很容易产生以“资历”作为认识干部的主要依据。在管理干部工作中最薄弱同时却是最重要的一环，是对工矿企业干部的管理工作。目前很多地方这一方面的工作基本上还没有建立起来。随着大量干部转入工矿企业，我们必须迅速加强这一方面的工作，否则势必影响国家的工业建设，将会犯严重的错误。二、对工农出身的老干部和妇女干部培养提高的工作做得很不够。有些领导同志和干部工作部门对工农出身的老干部和妇女干部缺乏应有的关心，甚至对他们采取轻视态度，嫌工农出身的老干部文化程度低，嫌女干部麻烦。这种态度显然是十分错误的。培养提高工农出身的老干部（其中包括相当一部分妇女干部）的关键问题是提高他们的文化程度。这一工作我们虽已开始进行，但还做得十分不够。今后必须在一定时间内认真将这一问题加以解决。培养妇女干部的主要障碍是在一部分男干部中仍然存在着歧视妇女的思想，而很多干部工作部门对培养妇女干部的工作也未予以应有的重视，这一缺点在今后工作中也必须认真加以克服。三、很多干部工作部门的工作还很缺乏计划性和主动性，存在着很大的盲目性和被动性，整天忙于日常事务，缺乏远见，对工作中的重大问题考虑不够。近年来这一点已有些改变，但仍应继续加以克服。我们相信以上这些缺点以及其他方面的缺点，经过认真努力的工作，是完全可以克服的，我们完全有理由预期我国干部工作将会取得更巨大的成就。
