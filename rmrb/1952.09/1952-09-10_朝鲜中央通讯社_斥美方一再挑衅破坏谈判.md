Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang. September 2nd. The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary, denouncing the US aggressors for intensifying a series of provocative acts, deliberately undermining the Korean armistice negotiations. The commentary wrote: The US aggressors, on the one hand, dragged the Korean armistice negotiations into continuous recesses and continued to massacre our captured personnel, and on the other hand, brazenly bombed peaceful residential areas in our rear. In the negotiations, the US side not only spent the entire month of August completely on continuous recesses and work slowdowns, but even resorted to extremely vile tricks of sowing discord. This series of provocative acts, which the US side has recently intensified, all illustrate that imperialist war provocateurs are plotting to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war in the decisive stage of the negotiations.

	The commentary pointed out: Our captured personnel in prisoner-of-war camps in Geoje Island, Busan, Nonsan, and other places are still being massacred in batches every day. Therefore, Truman's so-called "voluntary repatriation" deception, even if it is played out with all sorts of tricks, cannot deceive the eyes of the world's people. At the same time, the increasingly frenzied bombing of Pyongyang and other peaceful cities and towns in northern Korea by enemy aircraft has further exposed the essence of Truman's "humanitarianism" and the brutality of his aerial atrocities. In particular, on August 29, in what the enemy boasted as "the largest bombing since the start of the war," the enemy not only targeted peaceful residents for bombing, but also dropped bombs on opposing prisoners of war held by us, while shamelessly clamoring that they had destroyed some "military targets." However, this shameless clamor, which attempts to cover up the atrocities, more clearly illustrates that the enemy's crime of massacring people is planned.

	The commentary emphasized: The enemy's attempt to intimidate the Korean people with shameless threats, massacres, and other brutal means will not help their failed fate. This attempt will continue to go bankrupt in the future. The Korean people must demand blood debts from the American executioners who slaughtered their parents and siblings.

### 朝鲜中央通讯社  斥美方一再挑衅破坏谈判

    斥美方一再挑衅破坏谈判
    【新华社平壤电】朝鲜中央通讯社二日发表评论，痛斥美国侵略者变本加厉地制造一连串的挑衅行为，蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判。评论写道：美国侵略者一面把朝鲜停战谈判拖向连续休会，继续屠杀我方被俘人员，一面又横暴地轰炸我后方和平居民地区。美方在谈判中不但把八月份的全部时间完全用连续的休会怠工拖过去，甚至玩弄了极端卑鄙的挑拨离间的伎俩。美方在最近变本加厉地进行着的这一连串挑衅行为，都说明帝国主义战争挑拨者在谈判的决定阶段中，阴谋破坏谈判，扩大战争。
    评论指出：巨济岛、釜山、论山等地俘虏营里的我方被俘人员，每天还是成批地被屠杀着。因此，杜鲁门的所谓“自愿遣返”的骗局，即使耍尽花样，也是无法蒙蔽世界人民的眼睛。同时，敌机对平壤市与朝鲜北部其他和平城乡的变本加厉的疯狂轰炸，也已进一步暴露了杜鲁门的“人道主义”的本质及其空中暴行的残暴性。特别是八月二十九日的一次，即敌人所夸耀的“开战以来最大的一次轰炸”，敌人不但以和平居民为轰炸对象，而且也对被我方收容着的对方俘虏投掷炸弹，同时无耻地叫嚣着破坏了什么“军事目标”。然而，这种企图掩饰暴行的无耻叫嚣，却更加清楚地说明了敌人屠杀人民的罪行是有计划进行的。
    评论强调说：敌人企图以无耻的威胁、屠杀等残暴手段来吓倒朝鲜人民，这对其失败的命运是不会有所帮助的。这个企图，在今后也必将继续破产。朝鲜人民一定要向屠杀自己父母兄弟的美国刽子手索还血债。
