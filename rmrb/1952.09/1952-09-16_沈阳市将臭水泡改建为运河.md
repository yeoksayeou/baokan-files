To the Editor: To improve the urban environment and the people's lives, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government has decided to convert the stinking ponds in the southern urban area into a canal. This canal will be seventeen kilometers long, with five new and renovated parks along its banks, and 100,000 trees to be planted. The parks will also include sports fields, swimming pools, concert halls, and other facilities. The city's water system and sanitation will also be greatly improved as a result. This project is about to officially start and is scheduled to be completed in 1955. Every citizen of Shenyang is excited and encouraged by this.

    The citizens of Shenyang remember that during the Japanese devils' rule, they greened the areas where they lived, completely disregarding the living environment of the Chinese people. After the Kuomintang reactionaries came to Shenyang, they greatly cut down the few trees in the parks, making the city's sanitation even worse. In the southern urban area where the working people lived, one stinking pond after another emitted foul odors and bred mosquitoes and flies. After liberation, the People's Government, based on consolidating national defense and developing production, gradually improved the people's lives, and is now undertaking large-scale construction for the cultural life and health of the working people. This has made me deeply aware of the superiority of the New Democratic system, and the close relationship between the development of the motherland's construction and the improvement of the people's lives. I am a young student. I am determined to study hard, exercise, and contribute all my strength to building our beloved motherland.

    沈阳市将臭水泡改建为运河
    编辑同志：沈阳市人民政府为了改善城市环境和人民生活，决定把南部市区的臭水泡改建为运河。这个运河全长将有十七公里，沿岸要新辟和改建五个公园，植树十万棵；公园内并将修建运动场、游泳池、音乐厅等。市内的水道系统和卫生状况也会因此大为改善。这个工程即将正式动工，预定在一九五五年全部完成。每一个沈阳市民都为这件事感到兴奋和鼓舞。
    沈阳市的市民都记得：在日本鬼子统治时，它们把自己居住的地区绿化了，对中国人民的生活环境就根本不管。国民党反动派到沈阳后，把公园里仅有的一些树木大加砍伐，使市内卫生情况更加恶劣；在劳动人民集中居住的南部市区，臭水泡子一个接着一个，臭气薰人，蚊蝇繁殖。解放后，人民政府在巩固国防，发展生产的基础上逐步改善人民生活，现在又将大规模地为劳动人民的文化生活和健康而进行建设。这使我深刻地认识到新民主主义制度的优越性，祖国建设事业发展和人民生活改善的密切关系。我是一个青年学生。我决心努力学习、锻炼身体，为建设我们可爱的祖国而贡献所有的力量。
