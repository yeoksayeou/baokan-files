    Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Beijing-Shanghai radio facsimile (photo telegraph) service has officially opened on the 10th, with good results. The first photo transmitted from Beijing to Shanghai was a picture of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De inspecting the People's Liberation Army's 25th Anniversary All-Army Sports Meeting on August 1st this year.

    北京和上海开放无线电传真
    【新华社十日讯】北京—上海的无线电传真（相片电报）已自十日起正式开放，效果良好。由北京传往上海的第一张相片，是朱德总司令今年八月一日检阅人民解放军建军二十五周年全军体育运动大会的照片；由上海传到北京的，是上海电信局致北京电信局的一封祝贺信，信中祝贺北京上海间无线电传真的开放，字迹清晰。
    北京上海间开放无线电传真，为我国电信事业的新成就。今后北京上海两地照片、图片、表格、契约、证件等，都可以由无线电照相传递。更正本报九日一版“全国总工会常委会举行例会”稿第八行“安徽省总工会筹备委员会，”下加“主任为陈雨田，”，“郝桐生、张式楷为正副主任”句中“正”字应删去。
