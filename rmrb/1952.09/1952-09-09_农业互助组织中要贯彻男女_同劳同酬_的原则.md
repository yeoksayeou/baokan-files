    The principle of "equal pay for equal work" should be implemented in agricultural mutual aid organizations.
    Editor: Some farmers in Chefang Village, Sixth District, Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, have always underestimated the strength of women in agricultural production. This year, an agricultural production cooperative was established in the village, and the women raised the issue of "equal pay for equal work." They said that regardless of gender, work points should be recorded and scored according to the actual effect of the labor. For example, if women pull weeds and men hoe the ground, the effort exerted is equal, and the effect is almost the same, so both should be rated at eight work points. Some male cadres were initially unconvinced, but after going to the fields to experiment, they admitted that this method of recording work points was more reasonable. With the issue of work point evaluation resolved, the women's enthusiasm for production greatly increased. Women with children also approached female cadres, saying, "Quickly find a solution to the child care problem! I can also go into production." Some women said, "Joining the cooperative this time, and receiving grain based on labor, is like turning over once again."
    Currently, the phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work between men and women is still very common in rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The main reason is the lingering influence of feudal patriarchal ideas. If this phenomenon continues, it will limit the enthusiasm and creativity of women in agricultural production. It is hoped that the leading agricultural production authorities in various regions will educate cadres and farmers to make them realize that such ideas and practices are wrong. The principle of equal pay for equal work must be implemented when recording work points and scoring. When recording work points and scoring, female cooperative members or female group members should be included so that they can fully express their opinions, so as to truly achieve fairness and reasonableness. At the same time, the special circumstances of women should be taken into consideration, and reasonable division of labor between men and women should be implemented, and women should be encouraged to learn agricultural techniques. Some women compete with men in physical strength, and in some places pregnant women have suffered miscarriages due to overwork, which requires special attention from cadres. We must not only increase production, but also improve the health of women and children. Only in this way can we achieve "prosperity in both people and wealth" and complete the great task of increasing production for the love of the country. Xin Fuyu

### 农业互助组织中要贯彻男女“同劳同酬”的原则

    农业互助组织中要贯彻男女“同劳同酬”的原则
　　编辑同志：辽西义县六区车房村有些农民，一向轻视妇女参加农业生产的力量。今年村里成立了农业生产合作社，妇女们提出“同劳同酬”的问题。她们说，不论男女，都应按实际劳动的效果来记工评分。例如，妇女拔地，男子铲地，出的力相等，效果也差不多，都应评八分工。有的男干部开始不服气，直到下地做了试验，才承认这样记工评分比较合理。评工的问题解决了，妇女的生产积极性大为提高。有孩子的妇女也找妇女干部说：“快想法解决孩子问题吧！我也可以去生产。”有的妇女说：“这回加入合作社，凭劳动分粮，等于再翻一次身。”
    目前在农村互助合作组织中，男女同劳不同酬的现象还很普遍。主要原因是封建的男尊女卑的思想在作怪。这种现象如果继续存在，就会限制妇女在农业生产上的积极性和创造性。希望各地农业生产的领导机关，教育干部和农民，使他们认识这种思想和做法是错误的。记工评分一定要贯彻男女同劳同酬的原则。记工评分时，应吸收女社员或女组员参加，使她们充分发表意见，以便真正做到公平合理。同时，又应照顾妇女的特殊情况，实行男女合理分工，并鼓励妇女学习农业技术。有些妇女和男子硬拚体力，有些地方的孕妇因劳动过度，发生了流产的现象，这是要干部特别注意的。我们既要增加生产，又要增进妇女儿童的健康。只有这样才能达到“人财两旺”，完成爱国增产的伟大任务。　　　　　　辛福宇
