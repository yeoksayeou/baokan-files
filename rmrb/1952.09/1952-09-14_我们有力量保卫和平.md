    We Have the Strength to Defend Peace
    National Model Worker Ma Liu Hai
    Chinese workers have the strength to carry out peaceful construction, and also the strength to defend world peace.
    In the three years since the liberation of our Datong Coal Mine, under the brilliant illumination of Chairman Mao, production has rapidly recovered and developed. Now, most of the mining uses mechanical extraction, and production efficiency has increased seven to ten times compared to 1949. Along with the recovery and development of production and construction, the political consciousness and economic and cultural living standards of the workers have greatly improved. Workers have become mine managers and district chiefs; many have been elected as model workers. Worker schools, reading groups, cultural classes, and broadcasting stations have been widely established in the mines, and the quick literacy method is currently being promoted to eliminate illiteracy. Labor protection systems have been implemented in the mines, and workers' dormitories, canteens, bathhouses, hospitals, nursing homes, sanatoriums, stadiums, and cultural palaces have been built. The average monthly salary of each worker has reached more than 500,000 yuan, with the highest reaching 1,200,000 yuan. In the era of reactionary rule, workers toiled all year round but still could not afford clothes or enough to eat, wearing torn burlap sacks in the winter, sleeping without blankets, using coal-carrying pads as pillows, and living in dilapidated thatched huts. I had six brothers, all of whom started working in the mine in their teens, but we couldn't support the family. My mother had to grind flour for others, and my wife gathered grass seeds and picked leaves in the wild, just to survive. These conditions are now gone forever. In 1950, the workers began to wear new clothes and make new quilts; in 1951, they could even eat white flour, rice, and meat, and live in new houses. Many workers got married and started families. Most workers bought bicycles, watches, and radios, living happy lives. This year, most workers have savings in the bank. Life is becoming happier and more fulfilling day by day.
    All of this is brought to us by peaceful construction; and our ability to carry out peaceful construction today is inseparable from the consolidation of our national defense, the strength of the world peace camp, and the heroic struggle of peace-loving comrades around the world. The workers are very concerned about the struggle to defend peace. When we heard that the American aggressors were frantically slaughtering the Korean people and threatening our country's security and Asian peace, the workers were filled with unbearable anger, and the entire mine launched the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. More than one hundred workers joined the Chinese People's Volunteers, bravely fighting to defend peace. Last year, the workers of the entire mine donated more than 950 million yuan to support the Volunteers. At the same time, the entire mine launched a vigorous large-scale patriotic production increase and conservation campaign. The workers all said: "The higher our production efficiency, the greater our contribution to the cause of defending peace." Now we are actively engaged in the "safe production, five hundred meters tons, charting operations" movement, further developing the patriotic and internationalist labor competition, and creating new achievements for the cause of defending peace.
    We warmly welcome the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and will unite with the peace-loving people of all countries to do our utmost to fight for the defense of peace.

    我们有力量保卫和平
    全国劳动模范　马六孩
    中国工人有力量进行和平建设，也有力量保卫世界和平。
    我们大同煤矿解放三年来，在毛主席的光辉照耀下，迅速地恢复和发展了生产。现在大部分使用了机械开采，生产效率比一九四九年提高了七倍到十倍。随着生产建设的恢复和发展，工友们的政治觉悟和经济、文化生活水平都大大提高了。工人当了矿长、区长；很多人当选了劳动模范。矿山普遍建立了工人学校、读报组、文化班、广播站，目前正在推行速成识字法扫除一切文盲。劳动保护制度已在矿上实行，建设了工人宿舍、食堂、澡堂、医院、养老院、休养所、体育场和文化宫。每个工友每月的平均工资已达到五十多万元，最高的达一百二十万元。在反动统治时代，工人们整年劳动，还是穿不上衣服，吃不饱肚子，身上披着破麻袋过冬，晚上没有被子盖，把背煤的垫子作枕头，住的是破茅屋。我有兄弟六人，都在十几岁就下窑做工，但是养活不了家，我母亲还得给人家推碾子，我的妻子到野外采草籽、摘树叶，就这样过生活。这些情况现在一去不复返了。一九五○年，工友们开始穿上新衣服，做了新被子；一九五一年，更能吃到白面、大米和肉，住上新房子。许多工人都结了婚建立了家务。大部分工友买了自行车、手表、戏匣子，过着愉快的生活。今年，大部分工友都在银行里有存款了。生活一天一天幸福和美满。
    所有这些，都是和平建设给我们带来的；而我们今天能够进行和平建设，是与祖国国防的巩固、世界和平阵容的强大与全世界爱好和平的战友的英勇斗争分不开的。工友们都十分关心保卫和平的斗争。当我们听到美国侵略者疯狂地屠杀朝鲜人民，并威胁我国安全与亚洲和平的时候，工友们都愤怒的忍耐不住了，全矿工人掀起了抗美援朝运动。一百多工友参加了中国人民志愿军，英勇地为保卫和平而战斗。去年，全矿工友捐献了九亿五千多万元支援志愿军。同时，全矿开展了轰轰烈烈的大规模的爱国增产节约竞赛运动。工友们都说：“我们的生产效率越高，对保卫和平事业的贡献也越大。”现在我们正积极投入“安全生产、五百公尺吨、图表作业”运动，进一步展开爱国主义与国际主义的劳动竞赛，为保卫和平的事业创造新的成就。
    我们热烈欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，并将和各国爱好和平的人民团结一致，尽我们最大的力量为保卫和平而奋斗。
