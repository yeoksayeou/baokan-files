    Some Cinemas in Jinan Should Emphasize Film Promotion and Explanation

    To the Editor: Currently, some cinemas do not pay enough attention to the work of film promotion and explanation. For example, some cinemas in Jinan have not done this work, and many viewers cannot understand the films, thereby weakening the educational role of the films. When the famous Soviet film "The Man with the Gun" was shown, many viewers said, "It was a waste of money; I didn't understand what it was about!" Some, after watching the film "Chapayev," could not correctly understand the spirit of the film because they did not understand the historical background of the film. If the content of the film could be well explained to the audience before the screening, the audience would understand the film and have a correct understanding of the content. I believe that film screening organizations in various places should pay sufficient attention to the work of explaining films, and include the work of explanation as part of the entire film screening work, in order to strengthen the publicity and educational role of films.

    济南市的某些电影院应重视影片宣传解释工作
    编辑同志：目前有些电影院对影片的宣传解释工作，还很不重视。如济南市的某些电影院就未作这项工作，有许多观众看不懂影片，因此就削弱了影片的教育作用。放映苏联名片“带枪的人”时，很多观众说：“白花了钱，看不懂演的是什么！”有的看了影片“夏伯阳”后，因对这部影片的历史背景不明白，所以不能正确地理解影片的精神。如果在放映前能够很好地向观众解说影片的内容，观众就会看懂影片并对影片的内容有正确的理解。我认为各地电影放映机构应对影片的解说工作加以足够的重视，把解说工作列为整个影片放映工作的一部分，以加强影片的宣传教育作用。
