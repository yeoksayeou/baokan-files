    Overcome the Phenomenon of No One Taking Responsibility in Basic Construction

    Editor: The work at the West Daying Fourth Site of the basic construction project in Changchun City, Jilin Province, lacks a dedicated person to take unified leadership, resulting in chaotic work.

    For example, when making cement covers for the heating trench at the site, a stone construction worker told the workers to mix a certain amount of lime, sand, and stones. After the workers made three or four according to this instruction, Technician Yang looked at them and said they were wrong, then told the workers another set of instructions. The workers then made two or three according to Yang's instructions, but the person in charge, surnamed Cao, looked at them and said they still didn't meet the specifications, and immediately gave another set of instructions. Because the three people's opinions were inconsistent, they argued endlessly, and the workers had no choice but to stop working. Another example is that three-earth mixture and cement should be used to build the base of the heating duct, but because the leading cadres did not go deep into the site for guidance, the workers mistakenly used unslaked lime, resulting in the rework of some projects and waste of manpower and materials. The material allocation work is even more chaotic. Carters bring materials every day, but no one distributes them to the correct locations, so the carters simply dump the materials by the roadside and consider their work done; when the construction site needs materials, they have to pull them with wheelbarrows. In some sites, the materials have been used up for three or four days, but the person managing the materials is still unaware, so the site often experiences work stoppages waiting for materials.

    We hope that the responsible cadres at this site will quickly take responsibility, formulate a set of work systems, and strive in the direction of being faster, better, and more economical.    Ma Jingquan, Liu Lengyue

    应克服基本建设中无人负责现象
    编辑同志：吉林省长春市基本建设工程西大营第四现场的工作，无专人负责统一领导，造成工作混乱。
    如该现场修暖气沟的洋灰盖时，石施工员告诉工人用一定数量的灰、砂子、石子混合制做。待工人照样做出三、四个后，杨技术员一看说不对，他又告诉工人一套。工人又照杨的说法做了二、三个，姓曹的负责人看了还说不合规格，马上又吩咐一套。由于三个人的意见不统一，争执不休，工人只好停工不做。又如打暖气道底子要用三合土打洋灰地，但因领导干部不深入现场指导，工人们错用了未泡制好的生石灰，结果部分工程返了工，浪费了人力、物力。材料调配工作更是混乱。车夫每天拉来材料，无人分配送往何处，因之，车夫把材料往路旁边一倒就算完事；工地用材料时还得拿小车去拉。有的现场把材料已用完三、四天了，管理材料的人还不知道，因之，现场常发生停工待料现象。
    我们希望这个现场的负责干部迅速负起责任来，制订一套工作制度，向又快、又好、又省的方向努力。    马景全  刘冷月
