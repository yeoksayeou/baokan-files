    Wang Xifu Successfully Trials "Anti-Fiber Mask"
    Comrade Editor: Wang Xifu, the safety and health section chief of the Jin Sheng Textile Factory of the Shanxi Provincial Textile Company, has successfully trialed the "Anti-Fiber Mask" after half a year of research. This is a new contribution to labor protection in the textile industry.

    In the gauze workshop of the Jin Sheng Textile Factory, cotton fibers (fluff) fly everywhere. In order to protect the health of workers, the leadership distributes new masks every month. However, because the temperature in the workshop is high, wearing masks is very stuffy, and the workers are unwilling to use them. After repeated persuasion and education, sometimes they reluctantly put them on, but after ten minutes they were soaked in sweat and taken off again.

    Wang Xifu realized from his practical work that workers generally wanted to wear masks, but in fact, they could not wear them. To solve this problem, Wang Xifu began to study in March this year and went deep into the workshop for experiments. He was determined to make a mask that could prevent "fluff" without being "stuffy." First, he used fine copper wire gauze to make it, but the copper wire was hard and not tight, so it was not suitable. At the same time, copper encounters sweat and rusts, which is harmful to health. After that, he used paper green gauze to make it, which was better than copper wire gauze, but the holes were too big. In May, he began to try using horsehair Luo bottom, using two layers of fine Luo bottom and one layer of coarse Luo bottom, with cloth strips around the edges, the same size as cotton yarn masks. This time, the experiment was finally successful. The test results: it not only prevents "fluff" but is also not "stuffy," and each mask only costs 2,200 yuan.

    On August 28, workers in the gauze factory, fine yarn room, and coarse yarn room wore brand-new "anti-fiber masks" to work in the workshop. Some workers happily said, "Now we don't need to be mobilized to wear masks." For this reason, on August 29, Xia Qifeng, Deputy Director of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, personally awarded him a certificate of merit.

### 王锡福试制“防纤维口罩”成功

    王锡福试制“防纤维口罩”成功
    编辑同志：山西省纺织公司晋生纺织厂安全卫生股长王锡福，经过半年研究，试制“防纤维口罩”成功，这是纺织业劳动保护上的一个新贡献。
    晋生纺织厂的纱布厂车间，棉絮纤维（花毛）到处飞扬，领导方面为了保护工人健康，每月都发下新的口罩，但因车间的温度较高，戴口罩很闭气，工人们都不愿用它。经过再三说服教育，有时虽然勉强戴上，但十几分钟后就被汗水浸透了，又把它取了下来。
    王锡福从实际工作中体验出，工人们普遍有戴口罩的要求，可是事实上又不能戴。为解决这个问题，今年三月王锡福便开始钻研，深入车间试验，他决心要做出一种能防“花毛”又不“闭气”的口罩来。首先他用细铜丝纱来做，但铜丝较硬，带上不严密，不合适，同时铜遇到汗水也要生锈，有害健康。其后他又用纸质绿纱制做，虽较铜丝纱为好，但窟窿太大。五月间，他开始用马尾罗底试做，用两层细的罗底一层粗的罗底，在周围镶上布条边，大小与棉纱口罩相同，这次终于试验成功。试验结果：不但防“花毛”，也不“闭气”，每个成本只二千二百元。
    八月二十八日，纱布厂、细纱间和粗纱间等工人都戴上了崭新的“防纤维口罩”在车间里工作。有的工友高兴地说：“这一下保险不要动员也都戴起口罩来了。”为此，八月二十九日，山西省工业厅副厅长夏奇峰，亲自奖给他一个奖状。
