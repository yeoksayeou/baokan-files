Meeting Angelina
Zi Gang
    One group of the Chinese Farmers' Representative Delegation arrived at the Stalin City train station in eastern Ukraine one morning in mid-July. As usual, many people were waiting on the platform to welcome them. The forty-plus representatives in the delegation noticed a strong, tall female comrade. She was wearing a gray serge dress and had boyishly short hair, smiling and waving at the train car.
    "Who is that, wearing a chest full of medals!" someone in the delegation said.
    After a while, the translator introduced her as Angelina, the Soviet socialist labor hero and the first female tractor driver in the Soviet Union. The Chinese people had long known her name and achievements. Books such as "The Most Important Thing" and "My Collective Farm Life" were very familiar to everyone.
    Through the translator, Angelina explained that this was her third time welcoming a Chinese Farmers' Representative Delegation. The previous two times she had gone to other provinces to meet them, but she had missed them completely. The journey from her Lenin Collective Farm to the station was not short, and she had driven her small car to the station herself. She warmly invited her Chinese friends to her home and the tractor station where she worked.
    There were two female comrades in this group of the delegation: Guo Yulan, a female agricultural labor model from Heilongjiang Province, and Li Wanxin, Deputy Director of the Forest Industry Department of the Central Ministry of Forestry. Angelina was particularly warm to them, and her strong arms made them ache.
    "Did you see Comrade Stalin in Moscow?" Angelina, who had been cared for and encouraged by Comrade Stalin for more than 20 years, knew that the delegation had participated in the "May Day" parade in Moscow and was very happy for them.
    After receiving an affirmative answer, she said, "When Chairman Mao came to the Soviet Union in 1949, I met him and even ate with him." She looked very proud when she said this.
    Angelina, who started working as a tractor driver in 1930, is now the captain of a mechanized farming team at a tractor station, leading about twenty male tractor drivers. The members of the women's tractor team she led in the past have now been scattered all over the country. For more than ten years, she has been a representative of the Supreme Soviet, but she is still proud to continue serving as a tractor driver. She said, "In our country, every job is noble, as long as you can dedicate all your energy to your work."
    During the initial meeting, the members of the Chinese Farmers' Representative Delegation asked Angelina questions like old friends. She explained the various dazzling medals and awards she wore: Stalin Prize winner, winner of the Great Gold Medal of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner of Labor… but the one she wore most often was the most glorious Gold Star Medal of Socialist Labor Hero.
    On this day, the delegation had other schedules, so they agreed to see Angelina again another day.
    Afterwards, the delegation made a special visit to the tractor station where Angelina worked, listened to the stationmaster's report, and visited her mechanized farming team and her family twice. The head of the tractor station said that the cultivation of their teams was the most standard, and this was inseparable from Angelina's demonstration role. At this time, winter wheat was being harvested, and Angelina's mechanized farming team had exceeded the work quota again. When the representatives were visiting in the fields, a tractor happened to break down. Team leader Angelina jumped onto the tractor, then jumped down, found the cause of the fault, and quickly repaired it. She also ran to a very far place to drive a combine harvester, which was much larger than the tractor, to show everyone.
    The next day, the representatives attended a reception at the collective farm. Angelina and the guests enthusiastically toasted the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, and continuously toasted the Chinese people, especially the farmers. At this time, a female farmer ran over to report that she had exceeded the production quota for the day. Angelina hugged her warmly and toasted her. The spirit of collectivism and friendship filled their laughter.
    Here, the representatives saw the joyful scenes of collective farmers that they had only seen in Soviet films in the past.
    Angelina's family warmly welcomed the delegation. The old mother wore a floral dress to greet them at the door, holding a large loaf of bread, bacon, and a block of salt in her hands (this is a solemn ceremony in Soviet folk customs to welcome guests from afar). She also gave a large hand-embroidered towel as a gift to the delegation.
    "This is Angelina's mother warmly welcoming you," she said enthusiastically. "Chinese children, how much I want to see you. Why, so few girls came? I hope you don't forget me. When you see this towel, it's like seeing me. This is the result of my labor."
    The old father, Angeling Nigida Vasilievich, also came out to welcome the delegation. Both of these old couples had been hired laborers and suffered at the hands of landlords and rich peasants. Even Angelina herself had encountered various persecutions and was even crushed under a horse-drawn carriage by rich peasant villains.
    Angelina's eldest daughter read poetry to the Chinese guests to express the welcome of Soviet children. Living up to her mother's honor, she and her younger siblings were all model students in school, and she was an excellent piano player.
    Needless to say, Angelina has many working days every year. As a representative of the Supreme Soviet, she also receives a salary of one thousand rubles per month. She has a small blue building with four or five rooms besides the garage and warehouse. Carpets, wall carpets, pianos, radios, electric lights, running water, telephones, spring beds… are common things in the homes of ordinary collective farm members in the Soviet Union. But Angelina also has a library with many books. She studied at the Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy from 1939 to 1941 and gained a lot of agricultural knowledge. Someone in the delegation brought a translated copy of Angelina's works; they gave this translation to her, and she was extremely happy. She knew that her efforts for more than 20 years had also had an impact in China.
    In Angelina's private garden, apples, cherries, cantaloupes, etc. are planted. The apples are ripening, and the host used them to entertain the guests from afar.
    Delegation member Guo Yulan talked to Angelina about her experience in leading a year-round mutual aid team. She said that she had learned a lot of experience in the Soviet Union this time, and she was prepared to select what could be applied in China and implement it immediately. In the past, she had many confused ideas: she worried about not being able to afford a tractor, worried that the tractor would break down, and no one would know how to repair it. She had a fat baby more than ten months old and was afraid that when socialism came, the child would belong to the state and not recognize her mother. This time, she saw that in the Soviet Union, not only were there families and parental love, but also extremely harmonious relationships between relatives and friends. In particular, the distribution method of paying according to work, piecework, and bonuses for exceeding quotas made her feel much clearer.
    Angelina laughed when she heard the words of this female mutual aid team leader. This Angelina, who went from being a hired laborer to a tractor driver and a state activist, gave the forty-plus Chinese farmers' representatives an unforgettable impression in this meeting. (Attached picture)

    会见安格林娜
    子冈
    中国农民代表参观团的一个组，在七月中旬的一个早晨，到达东乌克兰斯大林诺市车站。站台上照例站着许多欢迎的人。参观团四十多位代表注意到一位硕壮高大的女同志。她穿着灰色哔叽衣裙，一头像男孩子似的短发，笑着向车箱招手。
    “这是谁呀，戴着满胸的奖章！”参观团里有人说。
    过了一会儿，翻译同志介绍说，这是苏联社会主义劳动英雄、苏联的第一位女拖拉机手安格林娜。中国人民老早就知道她的名字和业绩，“最主要之点”、“我的集体农庄生活”等书，对大家都是很熟悉的。
    通过翻译，安格林娜说明这是她第三次来欢迎中国农民代表参观团了。那两次她是到外省去迎接的，但全扑了空。从她所在的列宁集体农庄到车站的路程不算近，她是自己驾着小汽车到车站来的。她热烈地约请中国朋友到她家和她在那边工作着的拖拉机站去。
    参观团中这一组有两位女同志：黑龙江省女农业劳动模范郭玉兰和中央林业部森林工业司副司长李万新。安格林娜对她们格外的亲热，她们被她的大臂膊抱得发疼了。
    “你们在莫斯科看到斯大林同志了吧？”二十多年来一直受到斯大林同志的关心和鼓舞的安格林娜知道参观团在莫斯科参加了“五一”节观礼，很为他们高兴。
    她得到了肯定的答复以后，又说：毛主席在一九四九年到苏联时，她曾经遇到过他，“而且在一道吃过饭。”说这话时，她显出非常光荣的样子。
    这位在一九三○年开始当拖拉机手的安格林娜，如今是一个拖拉机站的机耕队队长，带领着二十名左右男拖拉机手。当年她率领的那个女子拖拉机队的队员，现在都分散到各地去了。十几年来，她一直是最高苏维埃代表，但是她仍以继续充任拖拉机师而自豪。她说：“在我们国家内，每一种职务都是高尚的，只要能把全副精力都贡献到工作上去。”
    在初次的会见中，中国农民代表参观团团员们就像熟朋友似地向安格林娜问这问那。她把身上的绚烂耀眼的各种勋章和奖章加以说明：斯大林奖金获得者、苏联农业展览会大金质奖章获得者、列宁勋章、劳动红旗勋章……而经常戴的是最光荣的社会主义劳动英雄金星章。
    这一天参观团因为有别的日程，约好改天再看安格林娜。
    之后，参观团专门去拜访安格林娜所在的拖拉机站，听了站长的报告；又两次访问她的机耕队和她的家庭。拖拉机站站长说，他们各队的耕作都是最标准的，而这是和安格林娜的示范作用分不开的。这时正在收割冬小麦，安格林娜的机耕队又超过了工作定额。当代表们在田间参观的时候，正好一辆拖拉机发生了故障，队长安格林娜跳上拖拉机，又跳下来，找到了发生故障的原因，很快便修好了。她还跑到很远的地方把一台比拖拉机庞大得多的康拜因开过来，表演给大家看。
    第二天，代表们在集体农庄参加酒会。安格林娜和客人们热烈地为中苏两国领袖干杯，为中国人民尤其是农民不断干杯。这时有一位女农民跑来报告，她本日已经超过了生产定额。安格林娜和她热烈地拥抱，和她干杯。集体主义的精神和友谊洋溢在她们的欢笑中。
    代表们在这儿看到了过去只在苏联电影中看到的集体农民的欢乐景象。
    安格林娜全家热烈地欢迎参观团。老母亲穿了花裙子在门口迎接，手里捧着大面包、咸肉和盐块，（这是苏联民间习俗、迎接远客的隆重仪节）她还以亲自绣的大手巾作为礼物，送给代表团。
    “这是安格林娜的妈妈热烈欢迎你们，”她热情地说：“中国孩子们，我是多么想看见你们。怎么，姑娘来得这么少？盼你们不要忘了我，见了这手巾，就如同见了我一样，这是我劳动的成果呀。”
    老父亲安格林·尼吉达·瓦西丽也维奇也出来欢迎代表团。这一对老夫妇都当过雇农，吃过地主和富农的苦头。就是安格林娜自己，也遭遇过种种迫害，甚至被富农坏蛋压在马车底下。
    安格林娜的大女儿给中国宾客读诗，表示苏联儿童的欢迎。没有辜负妈妈的荣誉，她和弟弟妹妹全是学校中的模范生，她是优秀的钢琴弹奏者。
    不用说，安格林娜每年的劳动日是很多的。作为最高苏维埃代表，每月还有一千卢布薪金。她有一幢蓝颜色的小洋楼，除了车库、仓库以外，有四、五个房间。地毯、墙毯、钢琴、无线电、电灯、自来水、电话、钢丝床……是苏联一般集体农庄庄员家庭里习见的东西。但安格林娜还有一间图书室，藏书很多。她在一九三九——四一年间在莫斯科齐米梁节夫农业学院学习，得到很多农业知识。代表团中有人带了安格林娜的著述的译本；他们把这个译本送给她，她高兴极了。她知道自己二十多年来的努力在中国也有了影响。
    在安格林娜家的私人园圃中，种着苹果、樱桃、香瓜等等。苹果正在红熟，主人用以招待了远客。
    代表团团员郭玉兰向安格林娜谈到她领导长年互助组的经验。她说，她这次在苏联学习了许多经验，她准备选择可能在中国应用的，立即实行起来。过去她有不少糊涂思想：发愁自己买不起拖拉机，发愁拖拉机坏了，没人会修理。她有一个十多个月的胖娃娃，害怕到了社会主义时候，孩子属于国家，认不得妈。这回一看，在苏联不但有家庭、有亲子之爱，亲友间也极融洽。尤其是按劳取酬、按件计工、超额有奖的分配办法，使她心里透亮得多了。
    安格林娜听了这位女互助组组长的话，笑起来了。这一位由雇农而当了拖拉机师、国务活动家的安格林娜，在这次会见中给了四十多位中国农民代表一个难忘的印象。（附图片）
