Xinhua News Agency, 1st. - Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker," reported from Kaesong on August 31st: During the major U.S. air raid on the Pyongyang area on August 29th, six of their own prisoners of war were killed and twenty-two were injured. Sixteen of the injured prisoners of war are in critical condition. Today, General Nam Il wrote again to Harrison, demanding an immediate explanation for the strafing of the Eighth POW camp, which is clearly marked, in the Jiangdong area east of Pyongyang. This POW camp has been attacked by the U.S. side many times. We remember that in the last major U.S. air raid on Pyongyang on July 11th, they killed and injured 110 UN prisoners of war in the Ninth POW camp near Pyongyang. When Jiangdong was bombed and UN prisoners of war were killed previously, the "Voice of America" in Tokyo said: "The Communists will have fewer prisoners of war to exchange." This attitude of disregarding the lives of their own prisoners of war is easy to understand, because these prisoners of war are Koreans—soldiers of the Syngman Rhee army. Jiangdong is quite far from Pyongyang, and there are no military targets nearby, but the U.S. bombing policy in these large-scale air raids is to bomb every living thing in this vast area. The U.S. side clearly knows that there are no military targets in or near Pyongyang.

The U.S. military bankruptcy in Korea has now reached such a degree that almost all they can kill are prisoners of war and civilians on both sides.

On August 30th, General Nam Il protested for the fourth consecutive day against the U.S. side's recent killing and wounding of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps. Now the U.S. side is taking violent actions against prisoners of war every day. It is pointed out here that incidents have also occurred in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps that supposedly only hold "voluntary" prisoners who stay with those captured. In his letter to Harrison on August 30th, General Nam Il said: Due to forcing prisoners of war to engage in dangerous labor, including the use of explosives, many prisoners of war in the Masan POW camp on the Korean mainland have died. Obviously, the mainland POW camps are forced labor camps—another U.S. action that violates the Geneva Convention. It is also clear from U.S. statements that the U.S. side is constantly taking violent actions in the POW camps because the prisoners of war are constantly opposing the U.S. side's forced detention of them.

The U.S. claim that they warn civilians to evacuate cities before bombing Korean cities is not worth any attention. This shows how cruel the U.S. has become. They falsely claim that this verbal warning entitles them to tear up international agreements prohibiting the bombing of civilians. I have seen civilians fleeing from burning villages being cruelly shot down by low-flying planes, even though the pilots can see that most of them are women and children. The U.S. claim that they are only attacking military targets is purely fabricated. They are trying to eliminate all living things in Pyongyang, slaughtering as many civilians as possible, dreaming of forcing the Korean people to submit in this way. But until now, the U.S. side still does not understand that they cannot achieve their goal.

### 英国“工人日报”记者魏宁顿  斥美方残暴屠杀战俘和平民

    斥美方残暴屠杀战俘和平民
    【新华社一日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿八月三十一日自开城报道：美机在八月二十九日对平壤地区进行的大轰炸中，击毙了他们自己的战俘六人，击伤二十二人。受伤战俘中有十六人情况危殆。今天南日将军又写信给哈利逊，要求立即交代这次扫射平壤以东江东地方有明显标志的第八战俘营的事件。这个战俘营曾多次遭到美方袭击。我们记得，在美方上次七月十一日对平壤进行的大轰炸中，他们把平壤附近第九战俘营的联军战俘击毙击伤一百一十人。在前一次江东被炸及联军战俘被击毙时，东京“美国之音”说：“共产党可以用来交换的战俘将更少了。”这种轻视他们自己方面的战俘生命的态度是很容易了解的，因为这些战俘是朝鲜人——李承晚军队的士兵。江东离平壤相当远，而且附近也没有任何军事目标，但美方在这些大规模空袭中的轰炸政策是轰炸这个广大地区内的每一个有生命的东西。美方清楚地知道，在平壤或平壤附近是没有军事目标的。
    美方在朝鲜的军事破产现在已达到这样的程度，他们所能杀死的几乎只有双方的战俘和平民而已。
    八月三十日，南日将军接连第四天抗议美方最近又打死打伤美方俘虏营中的朝中战俘。现在美方天天对战俘采取暴力行动。此间指出：在美方所谓只收容“自愿”和俘掳者留在一起的俘虏的俘虏营中，也发生事件了。南日将军在八月三十日致哈利逊的信中说：由于强迫战俘从事包括使用爆炸品在内的危险劳动，朝鲜大陆马山战俘营的战俘有许多人死亡。显然，大陆上的俘虏营是强迫劳动营——这是美方另一个违反日内瓦公约的行动。从美方声明中也可清楚看出，美方在俘虏营中不断采取暴力行动，是因为战俘不断反对美方强迫扣留他们。
    美方所说他们在轰炸朝鲜城市前警告平民撤离城市一点是不值得予以丝毫注意的。这表明美方已残酷到什么程度，他们伪称这种口头警告使他们有权可以撕毁禁止轰炸平民的国际协定。我曾看到从燃烧的村庄中逃出的平民被低飞的飞机残酷地射倒，虽然驾驶员可以看到他们大部分都是妇孺。美方所谓攻击的全是军事目标的说法纯粹是捏造的。他们正企图消灭平壤的一切有生命的东西，屠杀尽可能多的平民，梦想用这种办法迫使朝鲜人民屈服。但是直到如今，美方仍不明白他们是不能达到目的的。
