    Wangzui Village on the Banks of the Huai River
    By our reporter Bai Yuan
    One day in August this year, I visited a village in the middle reaches of the Huai River. This village is called Wangzui Village, located in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province. In terms of population, it is a medium-sized village. The village has 123 households, 662 people, and over 2,100 mu of land. After the land reform, apart from some public land, each person was allocated an average of over two mu of land.
    It was raining in the village, and the roads were muddy. I turned a corner along a small path from the side of a house and entered the village. I immediately saw red paper strips pasted on the door of every house. The bright red color attracted me in the rain. Stepping onto an earthen step, I stopped at the door of a house. A middle-aged farmer came out of the house, holding a mallet for twisting hemp rope in his hand and wearing shiny rain boots that looked newly bought. Seeing me, he stopped his work and greeted me, "Comrade, come into the house! It's started raining again." I looked at the red paper strip, which had 条条条文 but did not label the names. I asked him, "What are these that you've posted?" "This is a family plan. A guarantee to do a good job in production." He looked at me with a smile, as if he had endless details to tell. This farmer's name is Wang Baozheng, and his family has a total of eight people. The first item on their family plan reads: "The whole family has about twenty mu of land, and four mu need fertilizer. Apply an average of two cartloads of manure per mu. We already have four cartloads and still need four more." They plan to clear the mud from the ditch beside the house to accumulate one cartload of fertilizer, use ashes to compost two cartloads of fertilizer, and solve the remaining one cartload by picking up manure. Under this plan, all adults and children in the family share certain tasks. The plan concludes with, "Respond to Chairman Mao's call, Resist America, Aid Korea." After reading it, I found one thing very strange: Why do only four mu out of twenty mu of land need fertilizer? Wang Baozheng told me that these were lands that had been flooded for more than ten years and were covered with thick silt. As I later learned, such land accounts for the majority in the entire village.
    Wanting to settle myself down first, I left Wang Baozheng's house and headed to the village government. The village government office was located in the front room of a ancestral hall. The back room was the classroom of the village elementary school. The village chief was not in, and only a few young militia members were talking about something in the room. When they saw me, they stopped talking and went to find the village chief for me. After a while, the village chief arrived, followed by the militia captain, the mutual aid team leader, the women's association director, the youth league branch secretary, and many young male and female farmers. Because it was raining, and there was nothing urgent to do in the fields at the time, everyone had not gone to the fields and came to see who had arrived. Everyone was wearing a pair of rain boots. Some people wore Western-style shirts. Some women wore new floral printed cloth dresses. I almost mistook them for a visiting delegation from the city. Thinking of the ragged farmers who used to live in hunger, poverty, and disaster, I felt I had much to say to them, but I couldn't think of where to start. "Did you all wear rain boots before?" I finally asked. A young farmer leaning against a long table stretched out one foot and pulled up his trouser leg high, saying, "Before? Before, our shoes were pulled up to our knees (meaning barefoot)." I asked the women, "Aren't you afraid of getting your new clothes dirty when you wear them to the fields?" "Wash them if they get dirty," a young woman standing next to the women's association director replied. I then asked her, "On a rainy day like this, when you can't go out, why are you all wearing new clothes?"
    "Why not wear new ones? There are no old ones, what else would we wear if not new ones?" Her answer made everyone laugh.
    The changes in this village have only happened in the last year or so. Before the Huai River was harnessed, the floods of the Huai River inundated large numbers of houses and land every year. Before liberation, when the floods came, people would run to small boats and drift in the vast floods, barely surviving by casting nets to fish. After liberation, although there was relief from the People's Government, the people's lives still did not improve because they could not defeat the floods. Now, when you walk into the homes of the farmers in this village, almost every family still keeps a fishing net, hooks, and other fishing tools. These things are no longer needed, and people put them away, hanging them under the roof of their houses. Village chief Wang Guijun told me that at that time, their family's worn-out quilt, when it could no longer be patched, would be pieced together to make a quilt lining, and the quilt cover would be made of burlap sacks, considered a new quilt. As he was talking to me, a small child from I don't know which family interrupted from the side, "Grandpa, the quilts we used to sleep under were so heavy!" Wang Guijun said to me, "Before liberation, families who could fish were considered to be doing well. At that time, eighty families in the village fished, of which forty could barely make ends meet, and forty couldn't even eat enough. The other forty or so families couldn't afford boats or nets, so they couldn't fish either, and had to go outside to work or beg, and some starved to death outside."
    Last year was the first year of harnessing the Huai River. Happy days came so quickly. The changes in life are almost unbelievable. Now, on the land that was flooded every year in the past, sesame plants more than a meter tall are growing. The leaves of the soybeans covering the fields sway gently, and people are looking forward to a harvest without worries. Since last year, people have rebuilt the houses that were destroyed by the floods. They sell the harvested grain to buy livestock, farm tools, clothes, and other necessities. Wang Guijun and I calculated together that in the past year or so, the whole village has newly built ninety-six houses and repaired more than sixty; newly purchased one hundred and seventy-seven quilts; newly purchased four hundred and twenty pairs of rubber rain boots, as well as two hundred and fifty pairs of sneakers, and about forty sets of winter underwear; other various clothes, shoes, and socks are impossible to count. Wang Guijun told me that his family of six or seven people has made a total of three million yuan worth of clothes. A young farmer named Wang Baoxue married a girl from a neighboring village last winter. This girl's name is Chang Lanying, and she is twenty-three years old this year. Her family was also originally poor peasants. Her parents only had her as a daughter. When she got married last year, her family sent her many things. Wang Baoxue led me to visit their new house, but Chang Lanying was not at home, having gone back to her parents' house. Their wardrobe, trunk, bed, and bedding were all new. On a table next to the bed was a stack of textbooks and workbooks that Chang Lanying was studying at school. Because she had no way to go to school before liberation, she is now in the third grade of elementary school. From her homework, it can be seen that she is a smart girl. But only today has her intelligence become something useful.
    The continuous autumn rain keeps falling. Every night, after the young people finish studying in the classrooms of the village elementary school, they simply stay in the village government's building to sleep. They lie down in the room one after another, singing songs they learned on the construction site when they participated in the Huai River harnessing last year, or songs they composed themselves. The songs recall the floods and disasters of the past and praise the new life of today. This life has brought them endless hope for the future.

    淮河岸上的王咀村
    本报记者  白原
    今年八月里的一天，我访问了淮河中游的一个农村。这个村的名字叫王咀村，在安徽省的怀远县境内。按人口来说，这是一个中等村。全村有一百二十三户人家，六百六十二口人，土地二千一百多亩。土地改革后，除了一部分公地，每人大约平均分到二亩多地。
    村里下着雨，道路泥泞。我从一家房子的侧边沿着一条小路拐了一个弯，走进村子里去，一眼就看见家家的门口贴着红色的纸条。一片鲜红的色彩在 雨水中吸引着我。走上一个土阶，我在一家门口停了下来。屋子里走出来一个中年农民，手里提着捻麻绳的棰子，脚上穿着看来新买不久的发亮的雨靴。看见我，他一边停住手上的活计，一边向我打招呼：“同志，进屋里去吧！雨又下开了。”我看着那一张红色的纸条，只见上面写着一条条的条文，却没有标上名目。我问他：“你们贴的这个是什么？”“这是家庭计划。保证搞好生产。”他笑眯眯地瞧着我，好像有一时说不完的底细。这个农民的名字叫王保正，全家一共八口人。在他们的家庭计划第一条上写着：“全家共有二十来亩地，有四亩需要上粪的。每亩平均上两车粪。现在已经有了四车，还缺少四车。”他们计划清理屋边沟里的污泥积肥一车，用草木灰沤粪积肥两车，还差一车用拾粪来解决。在这个计划之下，全家大人小孩都分担着
    一定的任务。计划书上最后写着：“响应毛主席的号召，抗美援朝。”我看了一遍，觉得有一件事情很奇怪：为什么二十来亩地，只有四亩是需要上肥的呢？王保正告诉我，这些都是过去被水淹了十几年的地，上面积着厚厚的淤泥。据我后来了解，这样的土地，在全村来说也占大部分。
    为着想先把自己安顿下来，我离开了王保正家，走向村政府去。村政府办公的地方设在一座祠堂的前屋里。后屋是本村小学校的课堂。村长不在，只有几个青年民兵队员正在屋子里谈着什么事情。见我一来，大家就把谈话停下来，为我去找村长。一会儿，村长来了，民兵队长，互助组长，妇女会主任，青年团支部书记，还有许多青年男女农民也跟着来了。这是因为下雨，地里当时也没有什么要紧的活，所以大家都没有下地，听见有人来了，就跑来瞧瞧。他们每人脚上都穿着一双雨靴。有的人身上穿着西式衬衣。有些女的则穿着鲜花朵朵的新花洋布衣裳。我差一点把他们当成那个城市里来的参观团。想起从前在饥饿、贫困和灾难里生活的衣着破烂的农民，我觉得有许多话想要对他们说，但一时想不出从那儿说起。“你们从前都穿雨靴的吗？”我最后问。一个靠在长桌子旁边的青年农民把一只脚伸出来，用两手把裤腿拔得高高地回答我说：“从前？从前皮鞋拉到膝盖上（打赤脚的意思）。”我问妇女们：“你们穿这样的衣服下地，不怕弄脏了？”“弄脏了洗洗。”站在妇女会主任旁边的一个青年妇女回答。我接着问她：“这样的下雨天，又不能出去，你们怎么都把新衣服穿起来了？”
    “怎么不穿新的？没有旧的，不穿新的穿什么？”她这样一说，引得大家都笑了起来。
    这个村子的变化，还是最近一年多以内的事情。在没有治理淮河以前，淮河的洪水年年泛滥，年年淹没大批房屋和土地。没有解放的时候，洪水来了，人们就跑到小船上去，在茫茫的洪水里飘荡着，靠撒网打鱼来勉强维持生活。解放以后，虽然有了人民政府的救济，但是战不胜洪水，人们的生活还是好不起来。现在，当你走进这个村的农民家里去时，几乎家家都还保存着一副鱼网、鱼钩和其他打鱼的家具。这些东西现在都用不着了，人们把它收拾起来，挂在家里的屋顶下面。村长王桂均告诉我，那时他们家里的一床破被，补到没法补的时候，就拼起来做被里子，另外用麻包做被面子，算做新被。当他和我谈着的时候，不知是那一家的一个小孩子在旁边插了一句：“乖乖，那时候盖的被子真重呵！”王桂均对我说：“在解放以前，能够打鱼的人家还算是好的呢。那时候，全村有八十户人家打鱼，里面有四十户刚够吃，有四十户连吃也不够。另外有四十多户因为没有小船，置不起鱼网，连鱼也不能打，只有到外面去帮工、讨饭，有的饿死在外面了。”
    去年是治理淮河的第一年。幸福的日子，竟来得这样快。生活的变化，几乎是难于使人置信的。现在，在过去年年被洪水淹没的土地上，长起了一人多高的芝麻。铺满田野的黄豆的叶子轻轻摆动，人们无忧虑地期待着丰收。从去年开始，人们把过去被洪水冲毁的房屋也重新盖了起来。收获的粮食吃不完，就拿来买牲口、农具、衣服以及其他生活用品。我和王桂均在一起计算了一下，一年多以来，全村新盖了房子九十六间，修补了六十多间；新置的被子一百七十七床；新买的胶皮雨靴有四百一、二十双，还有球鞋二百四、五十双，冬天穿的卫生衣、卫生裤四十套左右；其他各种衣服、鞋袜，就无法计算了。王桂均告诉我，他一家六、七口人，前后一共做了三百万元的衣服。有一个青年农民叫王宝学，去年冬天和邻村的一个姑娘结了婚。这个姑娘的名字叫常兰英，今年二十三岁，原来家庭也是贫农。父亲母亲只有她一个女孩子。去年结婚的时候，家里送了她许多的东西。王宝学引我到他们的新房里去参观时，常兰英不在家，回娘家去了。她们的衣柜、箱、床、被褥，全是新的。在床边的一张桌子上，有一叠常兰英在学校念的课本和作业本子。因为解放以前没有办法念书，她现在才上小学三年级。从她做的作业上可以看出，她是一个聪明的女孩子。但是，只有在今天，她的聪明才成为有用的东西。
    连绵的秋雨不住地下着。每天晚上，青年们在本村小学校的课室里学习完毕以后，就索性留在村政府的屋子里睡觉。他们一个挨着一个在屋子里躺下来，大家在一起唱着去年参加治淮时在工地上学会的、或是他们自己编的歌曲。歌曲回忆着过去的洪水和灾难，也歌颂着今天的新的生活。这个生活给他们带来了无止尽的、对于未来的希望。
