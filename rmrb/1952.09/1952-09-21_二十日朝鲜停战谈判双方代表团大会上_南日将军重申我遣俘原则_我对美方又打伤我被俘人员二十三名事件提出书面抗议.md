Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th - At the twentieth session of the Korean armistice talks on the 20th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out that the principle of letting prisoners of war return home to live peaceful lives is fully in line with the 1949 Geneva Convention and the principle of repatriation of prisoners stipulated in the draft armistice agreement that both parties have already agreed upon, and is absolutely fair and reasonable. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers insist on this fair and reasonable principle. The other side's continuous massacre of prisoners of war and insistence on detaining prisoners of war completely violates the 1949 Geneva Convention and the clauses on repatriation of prisoners in the draft armistice agreement that both parties have already agreed upon, and is completely unreasonable. If the other side is willing to achieve an armistice in Korea, it must immediately stop massacring prisoners of war, abandon the absurd idea of detaining prisoners of war, and accept our fair and reasonable principle and plan for repatriation of prisoners. The U.S. chief representative, Harrison, could not deny the crime of massacring prisoners of war and could not defend the idea of detaining prisoners of war, but shamelessly listed the countries that had sent troops or supplied materials in the war of aggression against Korea under the instigation of the United States, in an attempt to have other countries share the towering crimes of the United States in aggressing against Korea, massacring prisoners of war, and delaying the armistice. General Nam Il sternly pointed out that the U.S. side cannot represent the people of its so-called allied countries, nor can it represent the people of the United States itself. It is only for the benefit of a small number of arms dealers and war profiteers in the United States that soldiers from more than ten countries are driven by the U.S. side to be far away from their own countries, using their lives as the price to carry out inhumane destruction and massacres against the innocent Korean people. The people of the world who advocate justice and love peace unanimously condemn the U.S. side for launching and carrying out this unjust war and demand an early end to the bloodshed in Korea, but the U.S. side still insists on the plan to detain prisoners of war, deliberately delaying or even preventing the realization of the armistice. General Nam Il finally pointed out that the only issue currently in dispute between the two sides is a major issue of principle. Any proposal to detain prisoners of war so that they cannot return home is absolutely unacceptable to our side. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are determined to fight to the end for the fair and reasonable principle of prisoners of war returning home. At the suggestion of the other side, the delegates' conference was adjourned again for a week and will reconvene on September 28.
    On the 20th, General Nam Il also lodged a written protest with the other side regarding the incident on September 17 in which 23 of our captured personnel were wounded by the U.S. side. General Nam Il pointed out that the U.S. side's endless atrocities of killing and wounding large numbers of prisoners of war completely exposed the U.S. side's despicable lie of so-called safeguarding the individual rights of prisoners of war and fully demonstrated the U.S. side's sinful proposition of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The U.S. side cannot escape responsibility for this atrocity.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th - On the 17th, the U.S. side again wounded 23 of our captured personnel in the "civilian detention camp" on Pongam Island on the grounds of holding a "demonstration."
    The U.S. side, as usual, remained silent as to why these prisoners of war, who were classified as "civilians," were holding a "demonstration." However, people still remember that more than a month ago, the U.S. side classified 27,000 prisoners of war as "civilians" and handed them over to the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, while these "civilians" were listed as prisoners of war in the list given to us by the U.S. side through the International Committee of the Red Cross, which they repeatedly praised as "impartial." Obviously, these prisoners of war, who have been classified as so-called "civilians," are continuing their heroic struggle against forced detention and refusing to be cannon fodder for the U.S. side, and they are continuing to suffer the U.S. side's brutal suppression.

    二十日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    南日将军重申我遣俘原则
    我对美方又打伤我被俘人员二十三名事件提出书面抗议
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出，让战俘回家过和平生活的原则，完全符合一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方业已协议的停战协定草案所规定的遣俘原则，是绝对公平合理的。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚持这个公平合理的原则。对方不断屠杀战俘、坚持扣留战俘的主张，完全违反一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方业已协议的停战协定草案的遣俘条款，是完全没有道理的。如果对方愿意在朝鲜停战，就必须立即停止屠杀战俘，放弃扣留战俘的荒谬主张，接受我方公平合理的遣俘原则和方案。美方首席代表哈利逊不能否认屠杀战俘的罪行，无法辩护扣留战俘的主张，却无耻地列举在美国驱使下在侵略朝鲜战争中派有军队或供应物资的国家，企图使其他各国分担美国侵略朝鲜屠杀战俘和拖延停战的滔天罪行。南日将军严词指出，美方不但不能代表其所谓同盟国家的人民，也不能代表美国本国的人民。只是为了美方一小撮军火商人和战争贩子的利益，十余个国家的士兵被美方驱使着远离他们的本国，用他们的生命作代价，来对无辜的朝鲜人民进行惨无人道的破坏和屠杀。全世界主张正义、爱好和平的人民，都一致谴责美方发动并进行这一非正义的战争，要求早日停止在朝鲜的流血，而美方却仍然坚持扣留战俘的方案，蓄意拖延乃至阻止停战的实现。南日将军最后指出，双方目前唯一争执的问题是一个重大的原则问题。任何扣留战俘使他们不能回家的主张，都是我方所绝对不能考虑的。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚决为战俘回家的公平合理的原则，战斗到底。双方代表团大会在对方建议下，再次休会一星期，九月二十八日复会。
    二十日南日将军并就九月十七日美方打伤我方被俘人员二十三名的事件，向对方提出书面抗议。南日将军指出，美方无休止地杀伤大批战俘的暴行，完全揭露了美方所谓维护战俘个人权利的卑劣谎言，充分显示了美方强迫扣留战俘的罪恶主张。对这种暴行美方决不能逃脱责任。
    【新华社开城二十日电】美方十七日又在丰安岛“平民拘留营”中打伤我方被俘人员二十三名，罪名是举行“示威”。
    对于这些被列作“平民”的战俘究竟为什么要举行“示威”，美方照例默不作声。但是人们都还记得，一个多月以前，美方曾经将两万七千名战俘列作“平民”移交给了李承晚匪帮，而这些“平民”在美方经由他们一再称道为“公正”的红十字国际委员会交给我方的名单中是列为战俘的。显然这些已被列作所谓“平民”的战俘，正在继续进行反对强迫扣留、拒绝替美方充当炮灰的英勇斗争，而他们正继续遭受美方的残酷镇压。
