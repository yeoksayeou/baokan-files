    American Air Force POW Lieutenant Kniss' Confession Regarding the US Military's Germ Warfare in Korea

    My name is Paul R. Kniss. I am a member of the United States Air Force Reserve. My rank is Lieutenant. My serial number is AO—1909 070. I was born on April 29, 1927, in Monmouth, Illinois. My wife's address is 1103 Southwest Military Drive, San Antonio, Texas. My parents' address is 339 South 7th Street, Monmouth, Illinois.

    In December 1946, I joined the Air Force as an Airman First Class. Later, I graduated as a pilot and became a flight instructor at Craig Air Force Base. I stayed at Craig until January 30, 1952, when I was ordered to Korea. On February 21, 1952, I arrived at Camp Stoneman in California, waiting to be sent abroad. Five other instructors from Craig were also waiting to go abroad. Their names were Lieutenant John Carleton, Lieutenant John Jansen, Lieutenant James Camp, Lieutenant Robert Manning, and Lieutenant Randall. From Camp Stoneman, we were sent to Korea. We arrived at K-46 base (F-51 base, about five miles north of Wonju) on March 20, 1952. I was assigned to the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, flying F-51 aircraft.

    In June 1951, when I was still at Craig Air Force Base, I heard a lecture in our squadron's flight room. All the pilots of the 3616th Pilot Training Squadron were present.

    The speaker was our education officer, Captain Laurie. He lectured on atomic bomb defense for an hour. He spoke in detail about how to defend against atomic bombs on the ground. He said that the damage caused by an atomic bomb was no more severe than that of ordinary bombs, only that it destroyed a larger area. Hiding underground, or under a table, or against a wall, could protect us from the harm of the explosion. He said that without hiding behind certain objects, people within 3/4 of a mile of the explosion would die, and beyond half a mile, there would be no radiation damage. He said that within 1/4 of a mile of the explosion, the heat would burn everyone to death.

    He went on to say that the real danger was germ warfare, which other countries were planning. He said that these germs could be loaded into bombs, or secretly carried into the country by special agents, or loaded into shells and launched by submarines. He said he expected that in 1952, all military personnel would take special courses on germ warfare, be issued protective masks, and receive special preventive injections. The pilots in our squadron asked him where he got this information. He did not say where, only that he would tell us more later.

    The day after we arrived at Camp Stoneman, February 22, Captain Holleman spoke for fifteen minutes to us six newcomers and other personnel who would be sent to various units in Korea. Lieutenant Charles Krohn, who was in my class at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana and was about to fly B-26 aircraft in Korea, also listened to this lecture. There were a total of fifty pilots listening. Captain Holleman was about thirty-five years old, wore glasses, was about six feet tall, had black hair, and was balding. He said that there were rumors that the United States was using bacteriological weapons in Korea. These rumors were untrue, and we were responsible for denying them. He said that the United States possessed germ bombs and could also spray germs from airplanes, but had not done so. When you hear any rumors of germ warfare, deny them. We in America now have a time-delay germ bomb (with a time fuse), and we also have a germ warfare bomb with a parachute. The germ bomb with a parachute contains diseased animals and insects, which, after being released from the bomb, will spread the disease. We can also use airplanes to directly spray germs. We can also use special agents to bring germs into enemy areas and put germs into the water pools of all towns. Holleman told us this in his studio at Camp Stoneman. After the lecture, I talked to the pilots in our unit about this issue. I and others believed that we were not conducting germ warfare in Korea and that it was propaganda spread by North Korea. We believed that our government would naturally prevent the spread of such information.

    Furthermore, on the day we arrived at K-46 base in Korea, March 21, Captain McLaughlin lectured to us six pilots—Lieutenants Carleton, Jansen, Camp, Manning, Randall, and myself—for an hour. He was about thirty years old and about six feet tall. He was our group's intelligence officer. He locked the door of the communications room and gave us the lecture. The 18th Fighter-Bomber Group had been conducting germ warfare since January 1, 1952. Captain McLaughlin said that we were now using two types of bombs: time-delay bombs and bombs with parachutes. In June, we would begin spraying germs from our aircraft. We would send four aircraft from our group to Tachikawa, Japan, on April 30, 1952, to be modified for spraying germs. A container would be installed behind the pilot's seat to hold the germs, which would be sprayed from the rear of the aircraft. These aircraft would be ready by June 15, at which time we would tell all the pilots in the unit how to spray germs. This method had been used in Korea and had been successful.

    Captain McLaughlin said, "In our time-delay bombs, we will use three types of germs, such as typhoid, malaria, and bubonic plague, etc. (He seemed to mention malaria, but I'm not sure.) These bombs will be transported from Wonju in special trucks and loaded onto the aircraft fifteen minutes before takeoff. (Normally, our bombs are loaded two hours before takeoff.) This truck is closed, and when you see it, you will know what it is. The loading of these bombs is done by special personnel from the ordnance department, who wear white uniforms, masks, and gloves. Don't be afraid of these bombs. You don't need to wear any special equipment; the germs won't escape. When you return from your mission, disinfect the aircraft."

    He continued, "We don't use any special aircraft to conduct germ warfare; we use whatever aircraft we have. After you return from this type of flight mission and report the flight results, immediately take a shower. The next day, you will have a blood test to see if you are healthy. If you are unable to complete the mission for any reason, do not drop the bombs, but fly the aircraft back to K-46 base and land. Do not talk about germ warfare at any time, and after each germ warfare mission, report the flight results as I have instructed. After the meeting, you must sign a statement declaring that you will not discuss the content of this talk with each other or with anyone else. The content of this lecture is 'Top Secret.' Our government will deny the facts of germ warfare for as long as possible. Don't feel uneasy about conducting germ warfare; all the other pilots in the unit are conducting germ warfare, and there will be more in the future."

    This is the shape of the time-delay germ bomb with a timer that Captain McLaughlin drew on the blackboard.

    The captain also said, "The dropping of these bombs is always done by four aircraft at a time, diving from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet, and then dropping the bombs on the target. The bomb explodes about one hundred feet above the ground, spreading the germs over about one hundred yards of ground. If the bomb does not explode in the air but explodes on the ground, the germs will be killed. If the bomb explodes in the air, the germs will be scattered by the force of the explosion. These bombs will be dropped near cities, but not within cities, because the North Korean people have widely used disinfectants in the cities, which will kill the germs. We will drop the bombs in the suburbs of large cities, and the germs will be carried into the cities by people and livestock. The germs must attach to people or livestock within three hours, otherwise they will die." Captain McLaughlin said that those germs were parasitic, meaning that they could not survive on their own and had to parasitize other organisms. They could only survive alone for about three hours. When you return from your mission, if it is successfully completed, you report that "mission accomplished, results uninspected." When reporting to the newspapers, say it was a "suppression of anti-aircraft fire" mission. Captain McLaughlin said that the shape of the germ bomb was similar to a normal five-hundred-pound time-delay bomb, and there were no special markings on it.

    This is the germ bomb with a parachute that Captain McLaughlin drew.

    Captain McLaughlin said that this type of bomb was only carried by one experienced pilot in the group. Among the group of aircraft, only he carried this type of bomb. He would dive from 10,000 feet to 1,000 feet and drop the bomb. The door at the rear of the bomb would open, and the parachute would make the bomb land gently on the ground. When the bomb touched the ground, the bomb body would split in half at the hinged joint. The bomb body was originally in two halves connected by a hinge. When the bomb split into two halves, the animals or insects would run out. In this type of germ bomb, we loaded rats, lice, mice, and fleas. This bomb was also dropped in the suburbs of large cities, not within the cities, because if it were dropped in the cities, the people would kill the insects and animals when they escaped. When returning from the mission, the pilots referred to them specifically as "non-exploding bombs." This bomb can be identified by the door at its tail, the hinge in the middle, and the part that splits into two. These two types of bombs cannot be flown at altitudes above 12,000 feet, because the lack of oxygen and extreme cold would kill the animals, insects, or germs. Captain McLaughlin said, "Once again, I want to tell you, don't discuss this matter outside this room, or you will be subject to military trial." He ended his instructions with this sentence. This instruction lasted from 8:00 to 9:00.

    Those present at the time were myself, Lieutenant John Carleton, Lieutenant John Jansen, Lieutenant Robert Manning, Lieutenant James Camp, and Lieutenant Randall. We had all been instructors at Craig Air Force Base and were all participating in this group.

    Captain McLaughlin brought a guarantee, gave one to each of us at the end of the lecture, and asked us to sign it. After we signed it, we returned it to him. The guarantee was about ten inches long and two inches wide. To the best of my memory, it said:

    "I understand that I cannot discuss anything discussed at the meeting on March 21, 1952. Violation will be punished under Article ×× of the War Regulations. Signed"

    I don't remember which article of the War Regulations was mentioned.

    The group's intelligence officer kept this guarantee in his office. If any pilot was found to be talking about germ bombs, he would be tried by a military court, and this guarantee would be the evidence for conviction.

    I felt disgusted about conducting germ warfare, but I also knew that I had no choice in this matter and had to follow orders. I also remembered Captain Holleman's words, which I used to believe, but now I began to doubt who was right and wrong in this war.

    At 5:30 AM on March 27, 1952, I, Captain Thomas (our leader), Captain Bruton, and Lieutenant Flohr were ordered to carry out a germ warfare mission. We were all from the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. In the group's communications room, with the door locked, Captain McLaughlin gave the orders. Captain McLaughlin showed us a photograph of several mountains ten miles south of Sariwon, with some small dots on them. The photograph was about twelve inches long and eight inches wide and was taken by the 67th Strategic Reconnaissance Team. He said that the small dots on the mountains were gun emplacements. I used a magnifying glass to look at the photograph, but I couldn't see any guns or gun emplacements. Captain McLaughlin said, "Your mission is a 'suppression of anti-aircraft fire mission.' You will take off at 7:00 AM and arrive over the target at 8:00 AM. While flying towards the target, you must fly high at 10,000 feet. When you arrive over the target, dive to 6,000 feet and drop the bombs. When you return, report to me that 'mission accomplished, results uninspected.'"

    He gave us the instructions, which lasted for fifteen minutes. After receiving the order, I went to the squadron's operations room and put on my flight gear. At 6:45 AM, I came out and walked towards my aircraft. Two people, wearing white clothes, masks covering their noses and mouths, and gloves, were loading the germ bombs onto our aircraft. They carried the bombs from the truck and manually installed them on the bomb hooks. The installation of this type of bomb was the same as a normal five-hundred-pound time-delay bomb, and there were no special markings on it. After they had finished installing the bombs and left in their vehicle, I checked the bombs to see if they were securely hung on the bomb hooks. My aircraft, like the other three aircraft, was equipped with two five-hundred-pound time-delay germ bombs each.

    We took off at 7:00 AM and climbed to 10,000 feet during the flight. At 8:00 AM, we flew over the target, which was ten miles south of Sariwon, about one hundred feet from the railway. We dove to 6,000 feet and dropped the bombs. Two bombs exploded on the ground, and six exploded in the air. The bombs that exploded on the ground had fragments flying in all directions, and gray smoke rose to a height of one hundred feet. The bombs that exploded in the air created a large cloud of gray smoke, about one hundred feet in diameter, which dissipated in about forty-five seconds. Then, our aircraft climbed back to 10,000 feet and flew back to K-46 base. We landed at 9:00 AM and reported to Captain McLaughlin in the intelligence room that "mission accomplished, results uninspected." We then took showers. While showering, I said to Captain Thomas, "The shower will wash my body clean, but my heart will never be clean after I have done this." At 8:00 AM on March 28, the doctor took our blood.

    The following is a summary of what I know about the germ bomb dropping missions: On April 29th, Lieutenant Daleo told me that he and Lieutenant Curry, Lieutenant John Jansen, and Lieutenant Randall had dropped eight time-delay germ bombs five miles south of Sinanju on April 5th. (These pilots all belonged to the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron). He also said that our squadron commander (12th Squadron), Lieutenant Colonel Crane, had dropped two germ bombs with parachutes five miles east of Sonchon on April 15th. At 9:00 AM on May 5th, I heard the commander of the 67th Squadron, Lieutenant Colonel Crow, tell Captain McLaughlin that he had dropped two "non-exploding bombs" near Pyongyang. This referred to germ bombs with parachutes. On May 21st, Captain Thomas told me that Lieutenant Edward Williams of the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron had led four aircraft to carry out a "suppression of anti-aircraft fire" mission five miles east of Kunu-ri. We knew at the time that they had dropped eight time-delay germ bombs.

    I want everyone who reads this document to know that it is my sense of justice, my ability to distinguish between right and wrong, that compels me to tell everyone the truth. My conscience has been troubling me ever since I committed these crimes, because I believe that anyone can distinguish between justice and injustice. This brutal war must be stopped. I present these facts to the world: that the American military is using an extremely inhumane weapon in Korea. Bacteriological weapons are not only used against the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, but also against the people of North Korea. The people of North Korea have already suffered the pain of war, and now they must also be harmed by the most brutal weapons of war. The current task of all the people of the world is to use the facts I have provided and demand an immediate end to the use of germ warfare in North Korea. The American people must insist that no country ever use this type of weapon again. Everyone in the world should do his or her part to stop war and inhumane acts. Only in this way can we achieve world peace. People in the world are brothers. Unless we all learn how to live collectively and help each other, we cannot achieve the urgently desired world peace.

    (Editor's Note on Kniss' Confession)

    On the surface, there seem to be many contradictions between Kniss' confession and O'Neill's confession, especially since they both belonged to the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group, both flew F-51 aircraft, and both listened to the instructions of the group's intelligence officer, Captain McLaughlin. The important points of agreement between the two pilots' confessions are:

        (1) Both were lectured on germ warfare by Captain McLaughlin immediately after arriving at the base, in small batches. O'Neill heard that McLaughlin's policy was to lecture all pilots on germ warfare as soon as they arrived at the base.

        (2) The methods used were: dropping germs in bombs with time fuses, dropping germ-carrying insects and small animals in bombs with parachutes, and directly spraying germs from aircraft.

        (3) The need for secrecy.

        (4) Regarding the altitude for dropping time-delay bombs, O'Neill said that he dropped them from an altitude of 7,000 feet, while Kniss said that they were ordered to drop them from 6,000 feet.

        (5) Germ warfare could also be conducted with artillery shells, but germ bombs were more effective.

        (6) Germ bombs were loaded by special personnel.

        (7) Reporting flight results in a special way, and Captain McLaughlin personally listened to the reports of flight results.

    The disagreements are as follows:

        (1) O'Neill was told that it didn't matter much whether the time-delay bomb exploded in the air or on the ground, the germs would live. Kniss was told that if the bomb landed on the ground, the explosion would kill the germs, but if the bomb exploded as prescribed at a height of one hundred feet above the ground, the germs would live. (Both said that the time-delay bomb was scheduled to explode at a height of one hundred feet above the ground).

        (2) Kniss was warned not to fly above 12,000 feet, because the lack of oxygen or cold would kill the germs and insects. O'Neill did not hear this instruction.

        (3) O'Neill was ordered to drop germ bombs in towns or densely populated areas, but Kniss was ordered to drop them on the edge of towns—five to ten miles outside the towns, as shown by the actual flight missions he participated in or knew about.

        (Regarding these three contradictions, it must be noted that Kniss listened to the lecture two months after O'Neill listened to the lecture. The Americans at this time must have already known that although germ warfare had been going on for at least three months, it had not produced the expected results. Experts would work hard to find every possible reason for its failure, and by the time Kniss listened to the lecture, there were attempts to try to eliminate any unfavorable factors. Such speculation is logical. The Americans had seen that germ warfare was not as simple as it initially seemed. Because the Korean people had taken various disinfection measures, Kniss was specifically told not to drop germ bombs within the towns.)

        (4) O'Neill was told that if he could not drop his germ bombs in North Korea, he should find an uninhabited place in South Korea to drop them, and ask the nearest radar station to determine the location of the drop, so that a special team could be sent there to pick up the bombs—do not activate the fuse when dropping the bombs, so the bombs would not explode. Kniss was told not to drop the bombs, but to bring them back to base. (Regarding this point, a possible explanation is found in a report published by various U.S. news agencies in early March, stating that a "mysterious" epidemic of typhus had broken out in a remote mountain village in South Korea. This was likely the result of some air force personnel "discarding" germ bombs, which exploded or broke when they hit the ground, causing this result.)

        (5) O'Neill said that germ spraying flights had been carried out in mid-February, and he had heard detailed instructions on how to carry out spraying missions. Kniss was told that germ spraying would not begin until mid-June, and that the aircraft had to be sent to Japan at the end of April to be modified. Both O'Neill and Kniss were equally certain that what they said was correct. O'Neill did see germ spraying aircraft parked in different places from other aircraft. There are two possible explanations for this. (1) The initial tests of spraying were unsuccessful, and the method had to be modified again, so it was temporarily abandoned. (2) The losses of aircraft performing germ spraying missions were too heavy (or there were too many losses of other F-51 aircraft, so the germ spraying aircraft were converted back to ordinary combat use), thus making it necessary to temporarily abandon this plan. It is worth noting that McLaughlin told Kniss that spraying germs had been used successfully in Korea, and February was a particularly heavy month for U.S. aircraft losses.

        (6) Kniss and others were forced to sign a guarantee to keep the matter secret, but O'Neill and those with him were not required to sign. On January 22, when O'Neill listened to the lecture, the Korean and Chinese sides did not mention germ warfare—in fact, it had not yet been confirmed that germ warfare had begun. By March 21, of course, germ warfare was being talked about a lot. Talking to all the prisoners of war, we know that this had caused debate and discussion in the air force base. The need to ban this discussion was naturally more urgent on March 21 than on January 22. When Kniss listened to the lecture at Camp Stoneman on February 22, he was specifically asked to deny rumors that the United States was conducting germ warfare. Obviously, such instructions were not needed when O'Neill listened to the lecture.

        (7) During Kniss' germ warfare flight mission, more attention was paid to the health of the pilots. After carrying out germ warfare flight missions, the pilots had their blood tested.

    Conclusion: The contradictions in the testimonies of these two pilots seem to only reflect that the Americans changed some methods when studying the germ warfare plan (Editor). (Xinhua News Agency)

    美国空军战俘克尼斯中尉参加在朝美军所进行的细菌战之供词
    我的名字叫保罗·克尼斯。我是美国空军后备队的一员。我的军阶是中尉。我的军号是AO—1909 070。我在一九二七年四月二十九日生于伊里诺斯州的蒙茅斯（Monmouth）。我妻的住址是得克萨斯州，圣安多尼，西南军路，1103号（1103 SouthwestMilitary Drive，San Antonio，Texas）。我的父母的住址是伊里诺斯州，蒙茅斯，南第七街，339号
    （339 South 7th Street，Monmouth，Illionois）
        一九四六年十二月，我投入空军，作一名上等兵。后来，我以驾驶员的资格毕业，在克莱格（Craig）空军基地当飞行教官。我留在克莱格，直到一九五二年一月三十日，我奉命往朝鲜。一九五二年二月
    二十一日，我抵加利佛尼亚州的史东曼（Stoneman）兵营，等候派遣出国，克莱格的其他五位教官也在等候出国。他们的名字是，约翰·卡里顿（JohnCarleton。）中尉，约翰·詹森（John Jansen）中尉，吉姆斯·堪普（James Camp）中尉，罗伯特·曼宁（Robert Manning）中尉，及蓝达（Randall）中尉。由史东曼兵营出发，我们被送到朝鲜。我们于
    一九五二年三月二十日抵达K—46基地（F—51基地，在原州以北约五哩）。我被派往第十二战斗轰炸机中队，第十八战斗轰炸机小队，驾驶F—51型飞机。
    一九五一年六月，当我还在克莱格基地的时候，在我们中队的飞行室，我听过一次演讲。第3616驾驶员训练中队的驾驶员全体在场。
    演讲者是我们的教育军官劳瑞（Laurie）上尉，他讲原子弹防御讲了一点钟。他很详细地讲在地面上如何防御原子弹。他说，原子弹所造成的损害，并不比普通的炸弹为重，只是破坏较大的面积。逃在地下、或桌子下、或靠着墙，就能使我们不受到爆炸的危害。他说，如果没有隐蔽于某些物体的后面，在距离爆炸3／4哩的人就会死亡，距离半哩以外，就不会受放射线的伤害。他说，距爆炸地点1／4哩以内，热力会把每一个人都烧死。
    他接着说，真正的危险，是细菌战，别的国家正在计划着。他说，这些细菌可以装入炸弹，或由特务秘密携带入境，或装入炮弹中由潜水艇发射。他说，他预料在一九五二年全体军事人员将要上细菌战的特殊课程，发给保护口罩，并打特殊预防注射针。我们中队的驾驶员，问他从那里得到这些消息，他不说什么地方，只说以后会再告诉我们多一些。
    我们到达史东曼兵营的次日，即二月二十二日，何礼门上尉向我们六个新来的人和其他将派往朝鲜各大队的人员，讲了十五分钟的话。查理·克罗恩
    （Charles Krohn）中尉是我在路易斯安那州巴克斯得尔空军基地时的同班，他即将往朝鲜驾驶B—26型机，他也听此演讲。听讲的共有驾驶员五十人。何礼门上尉大约有三十五岁，戴着眼镜，大约身高六呎，黑头发，头顶已秃。他说，外间纷纷传说美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器。这些传说是不确实的，我们要负责否认这些传说。他说，美国拥有细菌弹，也能从飞机上喷射细菌，但是没有这样做，当你们听到任何细菌战的传说时，要加以否认。我们美国现在有一种定时细菌弹（有定时信管），也有一种细菌战用的带降落伞的炸弹。带降落伞的细菌弹，装着染病的动物与昆虫，把它们从弹中放出之后，就会把疾病广播。我们也能用飞机直接喷射细菌。我们也能用特务将细菌带入敌人地区，将细菌投入一切城镇的水池中。何礼门在史东曼兵营的工作室中告诉我们这些消息。演讲完后，我同我们本队的驾驶员们谈到这个问题。我和其他的人都认为我们没有在朝鲜进行细菌战，那是北朝鲜所散布的宣传。我们认为我们的政府自然要阻止这种消息的传布。
    还有，在我们到达朝鲜K—46基地的那一天，三月二十一日，麦克拉夫林上尉向我们六个驾驶员，卡里顿、詹森、堪普、曼宁、蓝达五位中尉和我自己，讲演了一小时。他约三十岁，六英尺左右高。他是我们大队情报员，他在传令室把门锁上，对我们演讲。第十八战斗轰炸机队自一九五二年一月一日起，就在进行细菌战。麦克拉夫林上尉说，我们现在使用两种炸弹，一是定时的炸弹，一是带物降落伞的炸弹。在六月我们将开始从我们的飞机喷射细菌。我们将于一九五二年四月三十日，把我们大队的四架飞机送往日本立川（Tachikawa）改装为喷射细菌之用。将在驾驶员坐位的后面装上一个容器，以装细菌，细菌将由飞机的后边喷出。这些飞机在六月十五日可以装好，那时，我们将告诉本队全体驾驶员如何喷射细菌。这个方法已曾在朝鲜用过，并且成功了。
    麦克拉夫林上尉说，“在我们的定时炸弹中，我们将使用三种病菌，如伤寒、疟疾和腺鼠疫等等。
    （他好像提到疟疾，不过我记不准了。）这些炸弹将从原州用特别的卡车运来，在飞机起飞前十五分钟装上飞机。（平常，我们的炸弹，是在起飞前两小时装好。）这个卡车是关闭的，当你们看见它时，你们就知道它是什么了。装这种炸弹的，是军械部门的特殊人员，他们穿着白制服，戴着口罩和手套。不要怕这些炸弹。你们用不着穿戴任何特殊的装备，细菌是跑不出来的。当你们执行任务后飞返时，把飞机消毒。”
    他接着说，“我们不用任何特殊的飞机来进行细菌战，我们有什么飞机就用什么飞机。你们执行这种飞行任务回来、汇报了飞行结果之后，立即洗淋浴。第二天，给你们验血，看看你们是否健康。你们如因任何原因而不能完成任务，你们不要把炸弹投下，但带着炸弹飞回K—46基地着陆。你们无论在什么时候都不要谈细菌战，并且每次执行细菌战任务回来之后，都要照我的指示报告飞行结果。散会后，你们要具结，声明你们彼此或对任何人都不谈这次讲话的内容。这个讲演的内容是“极秘密”。我们的政府将否认细菌战的事实，否认得愈久愈好。不要为了进行细菌战而感不安，本队其他驾驶员全都在进行细菌战，而且往后还要增加。”
    这是麦克拉夫林（Mc Laughlin）上尉在黑板上画的定时爆炸的细菌弹的形状。
    上尉又说，“投掷这种炸弹，总是一次用四架飞机，投弹时从一万呎俯冲至六千呎，然后将炸弹向目标投下。炸弹在离地面约一百呎的空中爆炸，将细菌撒布于大约一百码的地面。如炸弹不在空中爆炸，而在地面爆炸，细菌就会被炸死。如炸弹在空中爆炸，细菌就被爆炸的力量炸散出去。这种炸弹，将投于城市的附近，而不投于城市之内，因为北朝鲜人民在城市中已广泛使用消毒剂，会将细菌杀死。我们将炸弹投于大城市的近郊，由人和牲畜将细菌带入城内，传播开来，但细菌必须于三小时内附在人或牲畜身上，否则即将死亡。麦克拉夫林上尉说，那些细菌是寄生的，意思就是说，它们不能自己生存，而必须寄生于其他的生物身上，它们单独只能生存约三小时。当你们执行任务返回时，如果胜利完成，你就报告说，“任务完成，结果未加视察”。对报纸发表消息，则说是“镇压高射炮火”的任务。麦克拉夫林上尉说，细菌弹的外形与通常的五百磅定时炸弹相似，上面也没有特殊的标志。”
    这是麦克拉夫林上尉所画的带降落伞的细菌弹。
    麦克拉夫林上尉说，这种炸弹只由大队中的一个老练驾驶员携带。在大队机群中，携带这种炸弹的，只有他一人。他将由一万呎俯冲至一千呎，将弹投下。弹的后方的门就开启，降落伞使该弹轻轻降落地上。当弹碰地时，就在用铰链连接的地方，弹体分裂成两半。弹体原来是分两半，由铰链连接起来的。当炸弹分为两半时，动物或昆虫就跑出来。在这种细菌弹中，我们装进鼠，虱，小鼠，跳蚤。这种弹也是投于大城市的近郊，而不投于城内，因为投在城内人民会在昆虫和动物逃出时将其杀死。执行任务飞返时，驾驶员的汇报，特称它们为“不爆炸的炸弹”。这种炸弹，可从其尾部的门、中部的铰链，和分裂为两的部位，辨认出来。带这两种弹时，不能在一万二千呎以上的高空飞行，因为氧的缺乏和极度的寒冷，会使动物，昆虫，或细菌死亡。麦克拉夫林上尉说，“再一次，我要告诉你们，出了这房间就不要讨论此事，否则你就要受军事审判”。他用这句话结束了他的指示。他这次指示从八时零分起，到九时零分止。
    当时在场听讲的，有我自己，约翰·卡里顿中尉，约翰·詹森中尉，罗伯特·曼宁中尉，吉姆斯·堪普中尉，和蓝达中尉。我们都曾在克莱格基地当教官，同时参加这个大队。
    麦克拉夫林上尉带来了保证书，在演讲终了时，每人发给一张，叫我们签名。我们签名之后交还给他。保证书的大小，约十吋长二吋宽。尽我所能记忆的，上面写的是：
    “我知道我不能讨论在一九五二年三月二十一日会上所讨论的任何东西。如有违犯，我将受战争条例第××条所规定的惩罚。署名”
    我不记得所提到的战争条例是第几条。
    大队的情报员将这保证书保存在他的办公室中。如果发觉任何驾驶员谈论细菌弹，就将由军事法庭审判，而这张保证书就是定罪的证据。
    我对于要进行细菌战，感觉厌恶，但我也知道在这件事情上，我没有选择余地，必须遵照命令行事。我也记得何礼门（Holleman）上尉的话，过去我是相信他的，现在我开始怀疑，在这次战争中究竟谁是谁非。
    一九五二年三月二十七日晨五时半，我、汤姆斯
    （Thomas）上尉（我们的领队）、布鲁顿（Bruton）上尉、福鲁（Flohr）中尉被令执行细菌战任务，我们几个人都是属于第十二战斗轰炸机中队。在大队传令室，锁上了门，由麦克拉夫林上尉传下命令，麦克拉夫林上尉给我们看一张照片，是沙里院（Sariwon）以南十里的几座山，上面有些小点。照片大约是十二吋长，八吋宽，是第六七战略侦察队拍摄的。他说，山上的小点是炮位。我用放大镜看这张照片，但看不出有炮或炮位。麦克拉夫林上尉说，“你们的任务是‘压制高射炮火任务’，你们将于七时起飞，八时到达目标上空。在飞向目标时，你们须高飞至一万呎。当到达目标上空时，俯冲至六千呎，将炸弹投下。返回时，向我报告说，‘任务完成，结果未视察’。”
    他给我们的指示，讲了十五分钟。接受命令之后，我到中队作战室，穿戴起飞行装备。在六时四十五分，我出来走向我的飞机。有两个人，身穿白色衣服，戴着口罩遮住鼻子和嘴，带着手套，正把细菌弹装上我们的飞机。他们将炸弹从卡车上搬下，用手将炸弹按装在炸弹挂钩上。这种炸弹的按装与正常五百磅定时炸弹一样，上面也没有特别标志。当他们按装完毕，乘车离开之后，我检查一下炸弹，看看它们是否紧挂在炸弹挂钩上。我的飞机与其他三架飞机一样，各装有两枚五百磅定时细菌弹。
    我们在七时零分起飞，在飞行途中，上升至一万呎。八时飞抵目标上空，那是沙里院南十哩处，距铁路约一百呎。我们俯冲至六千呎，将弹投下。两枚炸弹在地面爆炸，六枚在空中爆炸。在地面爆炸的炸弹，碎片向空四飞，并有灰色烟雾上升至一百呎高度。在空中爆炸的炸弹，造成一大片灰色云烟，直径约一百呎，约在四十五秒钟中消散。然后，我们的飞机再上升至一万呎，飞返K—46基地。我们在九时零分着陆，并在情报室向麦克拉夫林上尉报告说，“任务完成，结果未视察”。我们然后洗淋浴。在淋浴的时候，我对汤姆斯上尉说，
    “淋浴会把我身体洗干净，但我的心在我作了这事之后，将永远不会洗净”。三月二十八日八时零分，医生给我们验了血。
    我个人知道的投掷细菌弹任务如下：四月二十九日，大里欧（Daleo）中尉告诉我说，他和柯瑞
    （Curry）中尉，约翰·詹森中尉及蓝达中尉于四月五日在新安州南五里处投下定时细菌弹八枚。
    （这些驾驶员都属于第十二战斗轰炸机分队）。他并说，我们的中队长（十二中队）克林（Crane）中校于四月十五日在宣川东五里处投下带降落伞的细菌弹两枚。五月五日晨九时，我听见第六十七中队长格鲁（Crow）中校告诉麦克拉夫林上尉说，他在平壤附近投下了两枚“不爆炸的炸弹”。这指的是带降落伞的细菌弹。五月二十一日，汤姆斯上尉告诉我说，第六十七战斗轰炸机中队的爱德华·威廉斯（E．D．Williams）中尉曾领着四架飞机，到军隅里东五哩处，执行一次“压制高射炮火”的任务。我们当时知道他们投了八枚定时细菌弹。
    我愿意凡读这篇文件的人，都知道使我要把事实真相告诉每一个人的，是我的正义感，是我辨别是非的能力，使我不得不如此做。我在犯了这些罪行之后，我的良心一直使我苦恼，因为我相信任何人都能辨别正义与非正义。这种残酷的战争必须制止。我向全世界提出这些事实。即美国军队正在朝鲜使用一种极无人道的武器。细菌武器不只对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军使用，而且也对北朝鲜人民使用细菌弹。北朝鲜的人民，已经饱尝战争的痛苦，现在，他们还要受到最残酷的战争武器的侵害。世界全体人民目前的任务是，用我所提供的事实，并要求立刻停止在北朝鲜使用细菌战。美国的人民必需坚持主张任何国家都不得再使用这种武器。世界上的每一个人，都尽他的一分力量，来制止战争和不人道的行为，只有如此我们才能获得世界和平。世界上的人，都是兄弟，除非我们都学会怎样过集体生活，并彼此帮助，我们就不能得到如此迫切期望的世界和平。
    保罗·克尼斯（Paul R．Kniss）（签名）
            一九五二年七月二十日
    （编者对克尼斯的供词的评注）
    表面看来，克尼斯与奥尼尔的供词，彼此有许多矛盾的地方，特别是他们两人都属于第十八战斗轰炸机大队，都是驾驶F—51型飞机，都是听取大队情报官麦克拉夫林上尉的指示。这两个驾驶员的供词之重要的相符点有：
        （1）两个人都是在到达基地后，立即由麦克拉夫林上尉对他们讲细菌战，分批听讲，每批人数很少。奥尼尔听说，麦克拉夫林的政策是，所有的驾驶员一到达基地，马上就对他们讲细菌战。
        （2）使用的方法有：有定时信管的炸弹投掷细菌，带降落伞的炸弹投掷带菌的昆虫和小动物，从飞机直接喷射细菌。
        （3）需要保密。
        （4）关于投掷定时炸弹的高度，奥尼尔说，他从七千呎高空投下，克尼斯说，他们被令从六千呎投下。
        （5）细菌战也可用炮弹，但细菌炸弹的效力更大。
        （6）细菌弹由特别人员负责装载。
        （7）报告飞行结果，用一种特殊的方式，并且麦克拉夫林上尉亲自听取飞行结果的汇报。
    不相符的地方如下：
        （一）对奥尼尔说的是，定时炸弹在空中爆炸或在地面爆炸，也没有多大关系，细菌都会活。对克尼斯说的是，如果炸弹落到地面，爆炸时就会把细菌杀死，但是，如果炸弹照规定在离地面一百呎的高度爆炸，细菌就会活。（两个人都说，定时炸弹是预定在离地面一百呎的高度爆炸）。
        （二）克尼斯被警告说，不要飞高于一万二千呎，因为氧的缺乏或寒冷，会致使细菌和昆虫死亡。奥尼尔没有听到这样指示。
    （三）奥尼尔被令把细菌弹投于城镇或军队密集地区，但克尼斯被令投于城镇的边缘——在城镇以外五哩至十哩，如他所参加的或知道的实际飞行任务所显示的。
    （谈到这三点矛盾，必须注意克尼斯听讲是在奥尼尔听讲之后两个月。美国人在这时候，一定已经知道细菌战虽然已进行了至少三个月，但都没有产生预期的结果。专家们会努力在找求其不成功的每一个可能的理由，及至克尼斯听讲的时候，已有企图设法消除任何不利的因素。这样的推测是合乎逻辑的。美国人已经看到细菌战并不像初看那么简单。因为朝鲜人民已经采取了种种消毒措施，所以特别告诉克尼斯不要把细菌弹投于城镇之内。）
    （四）奥尼尔被告诉，在不能把他的细菌弹投于北朝鲜时，就在南朝鲜找一无人居住的地方把他们丢下，请最近的雷达站确定投掷的地点，以便派遣一特别队到那里把这些炸弹拾回——投掷这些炸弹时不要使信管发生作用，炸弹就不会爆炸。克尼斯却被告诉，炸弹不要丢下，要带回基地。（关于此点，一个可能的解释，见于三月初美国各通讯社所发表的一个报告，说在南朝鲜的一个遥远的山间乡村，“神秘”地发生斑疹伤寒流行。这很可能是某些空军人员“丢弃”细菌弹，这些细菌弹爆炸或碰地面时破裂，就引起了这种结果。）
        （五）奥尼尔讲，喷射细菌的飞行，在二月中旬，已有实行，他并曾听详细指示如何执行喷射任务。克尼斯则被告诉，喷射细菌要到六月中旬才开始，并且在四月底要把飞机送往日本去改装。奥尼尔和克尼斯都同样的肯定他们所说的是正确的。奥尼尔确曾看见喷射细菌的飞机与其他飞机停在不同的地方。这一点，可有两个可能的解释。（1）喷射的初步试验不成功，方法必须再修改，于是暂时弃置不用。（2）执行喷射细菌任务时，飞机的损失过重，（或是其他的F—51型飞机损失过多，以致把喷射细菌的飞机被改回为普通战斗之用，）因而使这个计划必须暂时放弃。值得注意的是，麦克拉夫林告诉克尼斯说，喷射细菌已在朝鲜使用成功，而二月又是美国飞机损失特别大的一个月。
    （六）克尼斯和别人都被迫签署一保证书，保证守秘密，但奥尼尔和同他一起的人，却没有被要求签署。一月二十二日奥尼尔听讲时，朝、中方面没有提及细菌战——事实上，还没有证实细菌战已经开始。及至三月二十一日，当然细菌战已被讲得很热闹。与所有战俘谈论，我们知道这已在空军基地引起了争辩和讨论。禁止这种讨论的需要，在三月二十一日自然比在一月二十二日更为迫切。二月二十二日克尼斯在史东曼兵营听讲时，特别要他否认美国正在进行细菌战的谣言。显然地，在奥尼尔听讲的时候，这样的指示是不需要的。
    （七）在克尼斯进行细菌战飞行任务的期间，对驾驶员的健康就更加注意。在执行细菌战飞行任务后，驾驶员们都验了血。
        结论：这两个驾驶员的证词的矛盾，看来只是反映美国人在研究细菌战计划时更改了一些方法（编者）。（新华社）
