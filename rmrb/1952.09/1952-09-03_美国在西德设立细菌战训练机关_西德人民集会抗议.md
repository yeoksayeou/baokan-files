Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 2nd: According to a TASS report from Berlin, the "Neues Deutschland" newspaper in Berlin reported that the American occupation authorities have established a so-called biochemical "education institution" in WessellsHof, Pfalz, West Germany, to train germ warfare personnel. This new criminal act by the US imperialists has aroused great anger among the West German people, and the people of Alzey, Hesse, held a protest rally for this purpose. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that 2,200 officers and soldiers of the American occupation forces have been trained in germ warfare in the past year.

The protest rally unanimously adopted a resolution demanding the immediate closure of the biochemical "education institution" in WessellsHof. The resolution emphasized that the events in Korea prove that bacteriological weapons are mainly used to massacre unarmed women and children. The criminal act of the United States in establishing a germ warfare training facility in West Germany is related to the signing of the Bonn war treaty. The Adenauer government should be held responsible for this crime. The Adenauer government will one day be judged by the people.

    美国在西德设立细菌战训练机关
    西德人民集会抗议
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社柏林一日讯：柏林“新德意志报”报道：美国占领当局已经在西德法尔兹州卫舍尔斯豪夫地方设立了一个所谓生物化学“教育机关”来训练细菌战人员。美帝国主义者这种新的罪恶行动引起了西德人民的极大愤怒，黑森州阿尔齐地方的人民为此举行了一次抗议大会。在会上发言的人指出：一年来，美国占领军中已经有两千二百个官兵受过细菌战训练。
    抗议大会一致通过决议，要求立即封闭卫舍尔斯豪夫的生物化学“教育机关”。决议着重指出，朝鲜的事件证明：细菌武器主要是用来屠杀没有武装的妇女和儿童的。美国在西德设立细菌战训练机关这种罪恶行动，和波恩战争条约的签订有关。阿登纳政府应该对这种罪行负责。终于有一天，阿登纳政府要受到人民的审判。
