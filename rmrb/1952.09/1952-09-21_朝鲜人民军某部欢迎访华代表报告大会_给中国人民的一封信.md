A Letter to the Chinese People from a Meeting Held by a Certain Unit of the Korean People's Army to Welcome the Report by the Visiting Chinese Delegation

Dear Chinese People:

Today, we heard from the comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China about your magnificent deeds in the great construction cause.

From the representatives' reports, we seemed to see the factories that have been returned to the people and are stepping up production; we saw the villages blooming with flowers, liberated from long-term feudal exploitation, and advancing towards a path of eternal happiness; we saw the fathers and elders with happy smiles on their wrinkled faces and the young people enthusiastic about learning. Across the vast China, from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, from the Gobi Desert, Inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang, all the way to the distant South dazzling with the sun, you are all expressing your sincere love to us with such enthusiasm. In order to defeat our common enemy – the American aggressors – you have launched the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country" movement, and we seem to be able to hear the beating of every one of your hearts here.

We listened to the report with immense joy and excitement.

Dear Chinese People! How could we not be excited and shed tears of gratitude when we listened to the report! Through the delegation, or through the direct assistance you give us, the fighting friendship between you and us, cemented with blood, is being consolidated day by day on the fighting Korean soil. In the smoke-filled front lines, in the days of constant enemy shelling, bombing, and strafing, we, the Korean people, are resolutely fighting with your assistance and the support of upright people all over the world. We are bravely fighting on those ruins that are no longer identifiable, on those bomb craters stained with blood, with hearts full of angry revenge. For the sake of our beloved motherland, we unhesitatingly throw ourselves into the ranks of killing the enemy. Your fraternal assistance inspires each of us to be more firmly convinced of the coming victory. Your assistance will be forever engraved in our hearts. Our young generation in Korea, accepting your sincere assistance, is bravely active on the battlefield to eliminate the enemy together with your own beloved sons – the Chinese People's Volunteers. They shout "Long Live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long Live General Kim Il-sung!" and rush into the enemy's陣地(zhèn dì, battlefield).

Dear Chinese brothers! The heinous enemy bombers have turned our beautiful mountains and rivers into scorched earth, turned cities and villages into ruins, and massacred tens of thousands of peaceful residents. However, the Korean people have not succumbed; on the contrary, they have become stronger. They have replanted crops on the burned land and obtained new harvests. Our poet Cho Ki-chon wrote:

	In the flames, and in the thick smoke,
	The people live and fight.
	Korea is fighting!
	The dark night road –
	On the highway at night, time bombs explode,
	Here, death grips life tightly.
	What shadow is it? What sound is it?
	"Heiyo, heiyo, aiyo hei!"
	The repair team is working,
	Pulling out the time bomb.
	Then, a whistle sounds in the darkness,
	A frost-covered truck stops suddenly.
	The young driver's voice –
	"How's the road?"
	"The road is good!"
	A girl's clear voice comes from the darkness.
	Immediately after, a whistle to depart is blown.
	On that long road, countless turns,
	Night after night, conquering death.
	This is the fighting Korean rear.

This is how the poet sings of the fighting Korean rear.

But the struggle is not only on the front lines and in the rear. Even in the enemy's rear, in the POW camps on Geoje Island surrounded by layers of enemies, the comrades, regardless of the enemy's repeated massacres, hold high the portrait of our beloved General Kim Il-sung, shouting Long Live the People's Republic, and persisting in the struggle with their bare hands for the freedom of the motherland and world peace.

Heroic Chinese comrades! The Korean people are not intimidated by the enemy. The Korean people do not know what fatigue is. Look, in any city or any village, in the arduous war environment, among the people who are fighting for victory, can anyone see the slightest trace of sorrow and frustration on their faces! Our hearts are burning with the fire of revenge, and we are fighting for justice. On this Korean peninsula, the American robbers who dream of conquering the world still do not know how the historical miracle created by the Korean people is being created.

Respected Chinese brothers! We clearly know your long struggle under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and we also clearly know the victorious face of your New China, which has become stronger through the nationwide struggle of the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis". The valuable experience of the Chinese people in defeating domestic counter-revolutionary forces and repelling foreign imperialist interference, and the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples cemented with blood, have greatly increased the Korean people's confidence in victory. It is because the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, armed with Stalin's internationalism, are with us that we have the power to create a historical miracle that makes the enemy tremble. No bombs, no murderous science, can break our close unity. This "miracle" of digging the grave of the American aggressors is completely natural to us.

People of victorious countries, people of happy countries! Your victory is the victory of Asia, and it guides the weak nations towards victory. Whenever we encounter difficulties, we think of the arduous revolutionary road you have traveled. Today, under the leadership of the Labor Party and General Kim Il-sung, we continue to advance towards victory. Let victory and glory shine even more brightly on the beloved Chinese people!

The entire personnel of the meeting held by a certain unit of the Korean People's Army to welcome the report by the Korean People's Delegation to China

### 朝鲜人民军某部欢迎访华代表报告大会  给中国人民的一封信

    朝鲜人民军某部欢迎访华代表报告大会
    给中国人民的一封信亲爱的中国人民：
    今天，我们从朝鲜人民访华代表团同志们那里，听到了你们在伟大建设事业中轰轰烈烈的斗争事迹。
    从代表们的报告中，我们仿佛看到了那些已回到人民手里的正在加紧生产的工厂；看到了那些从长期的封建压榨下解放出来正向着永远幸福的道路前进的开着花朵的村庄；看到了布满皱纹的脸上浮着幸福的微笑的父老和热中于学习的青年们。在辽阔的全中国，从北京、上海、重庆，从戈壁沙漠、内蒙古、黑龙江，一直到赤日眩目的遥远的南方，你们都是那样热情地向我们表示着真挚的爱。为了打败我们共同的敌人——美国侵略者，你们掀起了
    “抗美援朝，保家卫国”的运动，你们每个人心脏的跳动，我们在这里也似乎能听到。
    我们以无比的喜悦和激动听完了报告。
    亲爱的中国人民！当我们听报告的时候，我们怎么能不激动、不流下感激的热泪！通过代表团，或通过给予我们的直接支援，你们和我们用鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊，在战斗着的朝鲜土地上正日益巩固着。在硝烟笼罩着的火线上，在敌人不断地炮击、轰炸和扫射的日子里，我们朝鲜人民在你们的援助和全世界正直的人民的声援下，正在坚决地进行斗争。我们在那些已经无法识别原状的废墟上，在那些沾满着鲜血的炸弹坑上，怀着愤怒的复仇的心情而勇敢地战斗着。为了可爱的祖国，我们毫不迟疑地投入杀敌的行列。你们的兄弟般的援助，鼓舞着我们每一个人更加坚定不移地确信着即将到来的胜利。你们的援助，将永远铭刻在我们的心里。我们朝鲜年青的一代，接受了你们诚挚的援助，同你们自己心爱的子弟——中国人民志愿军在一起，勇敢地活跃在消灭敌人的战场上。他们高呼着“毛泽东主席万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”冲入敌阵。
    亲爱的中国弟兄们！万恶的敌人轰炸机把我们美丽的山河炸成一片焦土，使城市和村庄变成废墟，屠杀了成千成万的和平居民。不过，朝鲜人民并没有屈服，相反地，他们变得更加坚强了。他们在已烧焦了的土地上重新种上了庄稼，并得到了新的收获。我们的诗人赵基天曾这样写道：
    在火焰里，也在浓烟里，
    人民活着，战斗着。
    朝鲜在战斗着！
    漆黑的夜路——
    夜晚的公路上，定时炸弹在爆炸，
    这里，死神紧抓着生命。
    是甚么影子？是甚么声音？
    “嘿呦，嘿呦，嗳呦嘿！”
    修复队在工作着，
    拉出定时炸弹。
    接着，黑暗中响起了哨声，
    披着冰霜的卡车急停下来。
    年青的司机的声音——
    “路怎样？”
    “路很好！”
    黑暗中传来少女的清脆的声音。
    紧接着吹起出发的哨声。
    在那千里迢迢的路上，数不尽的每一个转弯，
    夜夜战胜着死亡。
    这就是战斗着的朝鲜后方。
    诗人是这样地歌唱战斗着的朝鲜后方。
    但是斗争并不只在前线和后方。就是在敌后，被敌人层层包围的巨济岛战俘营里的同志们，也不顾敌人屡次的大屠杀，高举着我们敬爱的金日成将军的肖像，高呼着人民共和国万岁，为了祖国的自由和世界的和平，他们赤手空拳地坚持斗争。
    英雄的中国战友们！朝鲜人民是敌人所吓不倒的。朝鲜人民不知道疲劳是什么。你们看，无论在那一个城市或在那一个农村，在艰苦的战争环境里，为了胜利而斗争着的人们，那一个人的脸上能够看到丝毫悲哀和沮丧的痕迹！我们满腔复仇的怒火在燃烧着，我们在为正义而斗争着。在这朝鲜半岛上，梦想征服世界的美国强盗们还不知道朝鲜人民所创造的历史的奇迹到底是怎样地创造着的。
    敬爱的中国弟兄们！我们清楚地知道你们在英明的毛泽东主席领导下为反对卖国贼蒋介石而进行的长久的斗争，也清楚地知道你们在建设新中国的道路上经过“三反”“五反”这一全国性的斗争而变得更坚强了的胜利的面貌。打垮了国内反革命势力，打退了外来帝国主义干涉的中国人民的宝贵经验，中朝人民用鲜血凝结成的友谊，使朝鲜人民的胜利信心倍增。就是因为以苏联为首的以斯大林的国际主义武装起来了的各人民民主国家和我们在一起，我们有力量创造使敌人战栗的历史的奇迹。任何炸弹，任何杀人科学，都无法打破我们的亲密团结。挖掘着美国侵略者的坟墓的这种“奇迹”，对我们来说，是完全自然的东西。
    胜利了的国家、幸福的国家的人民！你们的胜利是亚洲的胜利，它引导着弱小民族走向胜利。我们每当遇到困难时，就想起你们所走过的艰苦的革命道路。今天，我们正在劳动党和金日成将军的领导下，继续地向胜利前进。让胜利和光荣更加灿烂地照耀着亲爱的中国人民吧！
    朝鲜人民军某部欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表报告大会全体人员
    一九五二年七月二十一日
