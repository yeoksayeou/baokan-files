    The Central First Ministry of Machine Industry Issues Instructions
    to Launch Production Capacity Assessment Work in National Machinery Factories

    In order to explore the potential capacity of the machinery manufacturing industry and prepare favorable conditions for the large-scale industrial construction starting in 1953, the Central People's Government's First Ministry of Machine Industry issued instructions on the 9th to launch production capacity assessment work in national machinery factories. The instructions first pointed out that doing a good job in production capacity assessment is one of the most basic tasks of machinery manufacturing factories at the present stage and an important step in eliminating blindness in factory management. The assessment process will expose the key problems currently existing in the factory and their severity, establish goals for the factory to strive for, and point out the direction that leadership work should follow. Only by truly "knowing the score" can we have more confidence and systematically plan and deploy the central work for 1953. One of the main purposes of production capacity assessment is to prepare more scientific conditions for the preparation of annual production and financial plans and basic construction plans. The results of the assessment are a powerful basis for explaining the rationality and feasibility of the plan and provide necessary and appropriate content for basic construction plans, technical improvement measures plans, and production increase and savings plans. Therefore, capacity assessment should be a work that is closely linked and coordinated with the preparation of plans.

    The instructions require that before conducting the assessment, local machinery manufacturing factories should, in accordance with the spirit of the "Production Capacity Assessment Method for Machine Manufacturing Plants" issued twice by the Ministry of Heavy Industry on May 24 and August 28, 1952, designate special personnel and appropriately mobilize the masses to conduct the assessment. The instructions pointed out that the calculation should be based primarily on the production capacity expected to be achieved at the end of the planned year (1953) after the implementation of various measures. The capacity at the beginning of 1953 can be calculated simultaneously and summarized together as a basis for measuring existing capacity. Detailed calculations should be carried out in accordance with the "Production Capacity Assessment Method for Machine Manufacturing Plants."

    The instructions require that the assessment work of local machinery manufacturing factories should generally be completed before October 10, in order to cooperate with the upcoming deployment of the 1953 annual plan preparation work.

    中央第一机械工业部发出指示
    在全国机械工厂中开展生产能力查定工作
    为了发掘机械制造工业中的潜在能力，给一九五三年开始的大规模工业建设准备有利条件，中央人民政府第一机械工业部在九日发出在全国机械工厂中开展生产能力查定工作的指示。指示首先指出：做好生产能力查定，是现阶段机械制造工厂最基本的工作之一，是消灭工厂经营管理中盲目性的重要步骤。查定过程中将暴露工厂目前存在那些关键问题及其严重程度，为工厂树立奋斗的目标，指出领导工作应当遵循的方向。只有切实做到“心中有数”，才能更有信心有步骤地计划与布置一九五三年的中心工作。生产能力查定的主要目的之一，是为编制年度生产财务计划和基本建设计划准备更科学的条件。查定的结果是说明计划的合理性和可能性的有力根据，并为基本建设计划、技术改进措施计划、增产节约计划等提供必要而恰当的内容。因此，能力查定应当是与编制计划前后衔接、紧密配合的工作。
    指示要求各地机械制造工厂在进行查定前，应根据重工业部在一九五二年五月二十四日及八月二十八日两次印发的“机器制造厂生产能力查定法”的精神，指定专门人员，适当发动群众进行查定。指示指出查定时，要以计划年度（一九五三年）年终预计实施各项措施后的生产能力为主进行计算。一九五三年年初的能力，可以同时进行计算，一并总结，做为衡量现有能力的根据。详细计算应按照“机器制造厂生产能力查定法”进行。
    指示要求各地机械制造工厂的查定工作一般应在十月十日以前完成，以便配合即将布置的一九五三年年度计划的编制工作。
