    "Silver Swallows" Fighting in the Korean Sky
    By Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Erning
    One beautiful evening, a few white clouds floated in the clear sky. Over a certain area of North Korea, three Mustang and three Sabre enemy planes suddenly appeared, frantically flying from the northeast towards the west coast. From the disorder of their formation and the evasive appearance of their fuselages, it was clear that they were fleeing after being defeated. Two nimble and courageous "Silver Swallows" were closely chasing after them. These were the jet fighters donated to the Volunteer Army by the people of the motherland.
    These two "Silver Swallows" engaged the enemy planes in a duel over North Korea. The scene of this duel stirred the Volunteer Army troops and the Korean people on the ground. People hurriedly ran out of their houses and shelters, shouting, "Come and watch the air battle!" Everyone's eyes followed the speeding "Silver Swallows," waving towards the sky: "Look, those are our planes!" "Look! Our planes are so good!" Everyone's eyes were filled with joy and pride.
    The two "Silver Swallows" were closing in on the enemy planes. The enemy planes became even more panicked, with two of them desperately diving low, trying to escape the fire net that was about to engulf them. However, the "Silver Swallow" flying in front had already opened fire, and all that could be heard was "thump, thump, thump..."
    A short burst of cannon fire, and the tail of one enemy plane immediately billowed with thick smoke, plummeting straight into the green sea. A burst of enthusiastic applause immediately erupted from the crowd watching the air battle on the ground. Someone shouted loudly, "Hit! Hit!" "The American aerial bandits are going to drink seawater!"
    After our two "Silver Swallows" shot down one enemy plane, they continued to chase the remaining enemy planes, one in front and one behind. In the blink of an eye, the "Silver Swallow" in front caught up with another enemy plane, but it had stretched out a distance from its wingman. At this moment, a Sabre enemy plane attempted to attack it from behind, and the people's emotions immediately became tense. Everyone couldn't help but wave to that "Silver Swallow" and shout, "Hey, watch out behind you!" Some people anxiously shouted to the "Silver Swallow" behind, "Hurry up and catch up to cover it!" People completely forgot the distance between the sky and the ground, as if they themselves were participating in this aerial battle. Just then, only the sound of "thump, thump, thump" was heard, and the "Silver Swallow" in front opened fire again, shooting down the enemy plane it was chasing. However, the enemy plane attempting to attack it was very close to it and had already opened fire. In this very urgent moment, the "Silver Swallow" suddenly swerved quickly to the right, and the enemy plane missed, being flashed in front. Our agile "Silver Swallow" immediately turned around and tracked down this enemy plane. At this time, the "Silver Swallow" behind also caught up to reinforce its aerial comrade. People immediately shouted with ecstasy, "Chase it! Shoot it down! Shoot it down!" In an instant, another burst of fierce cannon fire came, and the enemy plane burst into a ball of fire, falling apart from the high sky.
    The air battle was won, and the two "Silver Swallows" shone in the golden sunlight, flying lightly to the north. People flocked to the square, applauding and cheering the victorious "Silver Swallows" as they returned. An old Korean woman with a face full of wrinkles and a mother carrying a child stood on the ruins destroyed by enemy planes, using grateful eyes to see the two agile "Silver Swallows" flying north.
    On another clear afternoon, nine American heavy bombers flew over a certain area of North Korea. They were in groups of three, forming a triangular formation, and were escorted by jet fighter groups to bomb the transportation lines of the Korean and Chinese troops. Just then, our four "Silver Swallows" suddenly appeared in the blue sky, surrounding the bombers from the left and right sides. The enemy planes' formation immediately became chaotic, and the bombers hastily dropped all the bombs and fuel barrels full of gasoline, scattering and fleeing for their lives. The enemy's fighters were also panicked, almost unable to cover their fleeing bombers. Thus, the bombers quickly fell into the fire net of our "Silver Swallows". With a burst of dense cannon fire, two bombers were shot down.
    The soldiers of the Volunteer Army ground troops who witnessed this air battle immediately composed a allegro, praising their heroic air force. They said: Buzzing overhead, enemy planes try to harass. Our "Silver Swallows" fly here, enemy planes flee back there, "Oil carriers" (enemy "F-80" jet fighters) are scared out of their wits, bombers are like mice seeing cats. "Silver Swallows," "Silver Swallows," so light and nimble, fly fast and fly high. Listen to a burst of cannon fire, one enemy plane emits smoke. "Silver Swallows," "Silver Swallows," so brave and heroic, plunge down from ten thousand feet, hitting the enemy planes into a daze, one by one falling headfirst. Volunteer Army soldiers clap and laugh, this one says: "Hit well and hit wonderfully!" That one says: "The American 'air superiority' is bankrupt!" The Korean villagers who saw this air battle also gave a thumbs up and said: "The Volunteer Army's planes are the very best!"

### 战斗在朝鲜天空的“银燕”

    战斗在朝鲜天空的“银燕”
    新华社记者  刘尔宁
    一个美丽的黄昏，晴空中浮游着几朵白云。在北朝鲜某地的上空，忽然出现了三架野马式和三架佩刀式敌机，它们慌慌张张地由东北方向向西海岸飞去。从队形的紊乱和机身躲躲闪闪的模样，可以看出是打了败仗逃走的。有两架轻巧的、勇猛的“银燕”在后面紧紧地追击着它们。那是祖国人民捐献给志愿军的喷气战斗机。
    这两架“银燕”在北朝鲜上空和敌机展开了决斗。这幕决斗的情景，惊动了地面上的志愿军部队和朝鲜人民。人们都从房子里、从掩蔽部里急急忙忙地跑出来，并且嚷着：“快来看空战吧！”所有人的视线都跟着飞驰的“银燕”移动，向着天空扬手：“看啊，这是我们的飞机！”“你看！我们的飞机多好啊！”大家的眼睛里都充满着愉悦和自豪的神情。
    两架“银燕”一前一后地向敌机越追越近了。敌机更加慌乱起来，有两架拚命地向低空猛降下来，想逃脱快要罩到头上的火网。可是，飞在前面的一架“银燕”已经向它开火了，只听到“咚咚咚……”
    一阵短促的机关炮声，一架敌机的尾部立即冒出浓烟，向着碧绿的大海直栽下去。在地上观看空战的人群中立刻响起了一阵热烈的掌声，有人高声地喊着：“打中了！打中了！”“美国空中强盗去喝海水去了！”
    我们的两架“银燕”击落了一架敌机以后，又一前一后地向其余的敌机追去。转眼间，前面的一架“银燕”又追上了一架敌机，但是它和自己的友机拉长了一段距离。这时，一架佩刀式敌机企图从后面偷袭它，人们的情绪立刻紧张起来，大家不禁向那架“银燕”挥手高喊：“喂，注意后面呀！”有的人着急地向后面一架“银燕”喊道：“快点赶上去掩护它呀！”人们完全忘记了天空和地面间的距离，好像自己也参加了这场空中的战斗。就在这时，只听得“咚咚咚”一阵炮声，前面的一架“银燕”又开火打落了被它追击的那架敌机。但是，企图偷袭它的那架敌机和它离得很近了，并且已经向它开火了。在这十分紧急的当儿，只见那架“银燕”突然飞快地向右一拐，敌机扑了一个空，被闪到前面去了。我们灵活的“银燕”马上扭过头来，向着这架敌机跟踪追去，这时后面的一架“银燕”也赶上去增援自己的空中战友。人们立刻狂喜高喊：“追啊！打掉它！打掉它！”霎时间又传来一阵猛烈的炮声，那架敌机冒起一团火光，四分五裂地从高空中掉了下来。
    空战胜利了，那两架“银燕”在金色的阳光中闪耀着，轻快地向北飞去。人们蜂拥地跑到广场上，向着胜利归去的“银燕”鼓掌欢呼。满脸皱纹的朝鲜老娘和背着孩子的母亲，站在被敌机炸毁的废墟上，用着感激的目光，欢送二架矫捷的“银燕”向北飞去。
    在另一个晴朗的下午，九架美国重型轰炸机飞到了北朝鲜某地的上空，它们三架一组，编成品字队形，由喷气式战斗机群掩护着前来轰炸朝中部队的运输线。正在这时，我们的四架“银燕”突然出现在蔚蓝的天空中，从左右两面向着轰炸机包围过去。敌机的队形立刻混乱起来，轰炸机仓皇地丢掉所有的炸弹和装得满满的汽油桶四散逃命。敌人的战斗机也慌乱了，几乎无法掩护它们仓皇逃窜的轰炸机。于是轰炸机很快就落进我们“银燕”的火网内了。随着一阵密集的机关炮声，就有两架轰炸机被打了下来。
    看到这次空战的志愿军地面部队的战士们立刻作了一首快板，歌颂自己英勇的空军。他们说道：头顶上、嗡嗡叫，敌机企图来骚扰。我们的“银燕”飞来了，敌机纷纷往回逃，“油挑子”（敌“F—80”型喷气战斗机）吓得乱了套，轰炸机就像老鼠见了猫。“银燕”“银燕”真轻巧，飞得快来飞得高。猛听一阵炮声响，一架敌机把烟冒。“银燕”“银燕”真英勇，万丈高空往下冲，打得敌机发了懵，一架一架地倒栽葱。志愿军战士拍手笑，这个说：“打得好来打得妙！”那个说：“美国‘空中优势’破产了！”看到这次空战的朝鲜老乡们，也都翘起大拇指说：“志愿军的飞机顶顶好！”
