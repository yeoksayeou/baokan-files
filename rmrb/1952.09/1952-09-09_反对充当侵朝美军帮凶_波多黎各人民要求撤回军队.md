　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 4th: According to a TASS report, the "Puerto Rican News Bulletin" published by the Puerto Rican Peace Committee reports: The voices of the Puerto Rican people demanding peace and the immediate withdrawal of thousands of Puerto Rican soldiers fighting in Korea are growing louder. The bulletin published a statement by the leader of the Socialist Party and chairman of the Puerto Rican Peace Committee, Ojedda, who said: "The Puerto Rican General Labor Union suggests that the Puerto Rican Peace Committee participate in the upcoming large-scale workers' parade. The Puerto Rican Peace Committee and various local committees will jointly march with workers from large and small factories belonging to the Puerto Rican General Labor Union. The working people of Puerto Rico are well aware that the struggle for peace is the basic condition for guaranteeing workers and peasants improved living conditions and peace and security. Puerto Rican workers have begun to understand that due to the imperialists' evil and selfish profit-seeking attempts, our children have been driven to the battlefield and are sacrificing their lives. The Puerto Rican people must strive for an immediate ceasefire in Korea and strive for a genuine and lasting peace." The statement continued: "The Puerto Rican Peace Committee, together with all the people, demands the immediate withdrawal of Puerto Rican soldiers from Korea, and the committee will fight against the rise in the cost of living, demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, demand the prohibition of atomic and bacteriological weapons, and strive for world peace."
