The basic construction work of a certain tungsten mine and a certain antimony mine both resulted in negative consequences due to blind design.

China has abundant reserves of tungsten ore, but the ore dressing recovery rate is very low, wasting many valuable national resources. In order to reduce resource waste and improve the ore dressing recovery rate, a certain tungsten mine built an ore dressing plant in 1950. During the design phase, there was no investigation into the interrelationship between the ore dressing plant and other production departments of the mine, such as mining plans and power supply, in order to achieve mutual coordination and balance in production. Therefore, although the ore dressing plant was quickly built and the ore dressing machine was installed, there was not enough electricity. If the existing electricity is used to operate the air compressor for mining, the ore dressing machine cannot be operated; if the ore dressing machine is operated, mining work must be stopped. If a diesel generator is used to supply power separately, the cost of ore dressing will increase. Therefore, until now, the ore dressing machine has not been put into production.

A certain antimony mine was also built in 1950, in order to smelt refined antimony, which the country urgently needed. However, the mine did not investigate the arsenic content of the ore (arsenic is a harmful substance in metallic antimony) before construction. Based only on past experience, the smelting equipment was built according to the method of smelting general antimony ore with a relatively low arsenic content, and a series of projects such as roasting furnaces, bag filter houses, and condensation systems were newly built. After the project was completed and production started, it was discovered that the arsenic content of the antimony ore was too high, and the newly built smelting equipment could not smelt this type of antimony ore. Now, it has been necessary to stop the production of refined antimony and switch to smelting crude antimony (antimony containing impurities). This does not conform to the original purpose of building the factory.

The reason why these two mines did not conduct thorough investigation and research work and blindly designed during the basic construction work is that they only saw the market demand for the product and the urgent need for production, and then blindly built the factories. However, the facts prove that without doing a good job of investigation and research, not only can production not be improved, but it will also cause a waste of national resources.

    不做周密调查而急于建厂的恶果
    任毅民
    某钨矿和某锑矿的基本建设工作，都因盲目设计，造成不良的后果。
    我国钨矿的蕴藏量是很多的，但选矿的回收率很低，浪费了国家许多宝贵资源。某钨矿为了减少资源浪费，提高选矿的回收率，于一九五○年建设选矿厂。在设计时，没有调查研究选矿厂和该矿其他生产部门的互相关系，如采矿计划和动力供应等，以便求得生产上的互相配合和平衡。因此，虽然很快地把选矿厂建设起来了，选矿机也安装好了，但没有足够的电力。现有电力如果开动采矿用的风压机，就不能开动选矿机；如果开动选矿机，就得停止采矿工作。如果另外用柴油发电机供给动力，选矿的成本就会提高。因此直到现在，该选矿机还没有投入生产。
    某锑矿也是一九五○年修建的，为的是冶炼国家最需要的精锑。但该矿在修建前没有调查矿石的含砒成分（砒是金属锑中的有害物质），只凭过去的经验，按照冶炼一般含砒成分比较低的锑矿的方法来修建冶炼设备，并新建了焙烧炉、布袋室、冷凝系统等一系列的工程。工程完成了，也开始生产了，才发现锑矿的含砒成分过高，新修建的冶炼设备不能冶炼这种锑矿。现在，不得不停止精锑的生产，改炼生锑（含有杂质的锑）。这和原来建厂的目的就不符合了。
    该两矿在基本建设工作中，所以不做周密的调查研究工作而盲目设计，是因为只看到市场上需要该项产品，急须生产，便盲目建厂。但事实证明，不做好调查研究工作，不但不能搞好生产，反而造成国家资财的浪费。
