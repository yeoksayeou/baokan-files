    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Rangoon: A rally was held in Rangoon on the 13th by more than 700 representatives from all walks of life to see off the Burmese delegation attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing. The conference was presided over by U Saw Zhi Kha (a senior monk), vice chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace. In his farewell address, he pointed out the disasters that war brought to mankind and the pain suffered by the Burmese people under the destruction of imperialist war, and emphasized the significance of the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference for the Burmese people. In refuting the absurd slander of warmongers that religious circles should not talk about peace, U Saw Zhi Kha emphasized: Peace is the common aspiration of mankind. Buddhists do not want to see the brutal acts of beasts collectively slaughtering human beings, therefore, religious circles need to talk about peace even more. After U Saw Zhi Kha's speech, the Burmese representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference gave a reply. The conference enthusiastically adopted the Burmese people's suggestions for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Rangoon: Burmese workers are enthusiastically supporting the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and have elected representatives to attend the Peace Conference. The All Burma Trade Union Congress recently issued a statement calling on Burmese workers to warmly support the Peace Conference with practical actions. The statement pointed out that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is closely related to the interests of the Burmese people and the working class, therefore, the Burmese people and the working class should actively participate in the peace movement to express their will to defend peace.
