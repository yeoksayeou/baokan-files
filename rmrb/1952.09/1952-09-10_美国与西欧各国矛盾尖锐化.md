Xinhua News Agency, September 9th:

    The United States has decided to dispatch the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chairman of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council, Pearson, to Western Europe to coerce Western European countries not to delay their military expansion plans. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 4th, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson summoned Pearson to Washington on the 4th for a secret meeting to discuss the "slow implementation of the Western European rearmament program" and "methods to strengthen the implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty rearmament program." After receiving instructions from Acheson, Pearson is scheduled to go to Western Europe on the 9th to participate in a series of NATO meetings.
    Pearson's trip to Western Europe indicates that the contradiction between the United States and Western European countries regarding the speed of military expansion and war preparations is becoming increasingly acute. Due to the severe economic crisis in Western European countries, and the strong opposition of the people to the policy of military expansion and war preparations, Western European governments have recently had to slow down the pace of military expansion. An Associated Press dispatch from London on August 23rd summarized the situation in Western European countries as follows: "The work of rearmament by the allies, whether in Britain or on the European continent, is slackening. ... The situation in various countries is: reducing defense budgets, easing the implementation period of military plans, and shortening the term of military service."
    Western European countries are not only reducing their military expansion plans within their own borders, but are also requesting the convening of a North Atlantic Group Council meeting to formally revise the military expansion plan adopted at the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in February this year. In early August, Norway and several other Western European countries requested the North Atlantic Group Council to hold a meeting in September. In early September, Agence France-Presse Washington reported that British Foreign Secretary Eden had also suggested that the North Atlantic Group Council hold a meeting in the near future to revise the Lisbon Plan.
    This situation greatly alarmed the United States. On the one hand, the United States is making every effort to oppose holding the North Atlantic Group Council meeting in September or October, insisting that the meeting be postponed to December. On the other hand, the United States is using pressure from all sides to force Western European countries to continue to step up military expansion and war preparations. At the meeting of the Standing Committee of the North Atlantic Group Council on August 20, the U.S. representative Draper loudly warned Western European countries: "No member state should seriously lag behind its defense goals." Now, the United States' dispatch of Pearson to Western Europe is a further measure to exert pressure on Western European countries.
    However, the means of applying pressure that the United States relies on obviously cannot solve the problems faced by the ruling groups in Western European countries. Even Pearson, who was ordered to go to Europe, admitted in a speech in Toronto on September 2nd that the North Atlantic Treaty member states "have encountered more serious economic and financial difficulties than they originally anticipated." Indeed, the root cause of the Western European ruling groups' having to cut back on their military expansion plans is precisely because these plans have brought them increasingly worsening economic and political crises. What measures can the United States come up with to cope with these crises?

    美国与西欧各国矛盾尖锐化
    【新华社九日讯】美国已决定派遣加拿大外交部长、北大西洋公约集团理事会主席皮尔逊至西欧活动，胁迫西欧各国不得延缓扩军计划。据合众社华盛顿四日电称，美国国务卿艾奇逊于四日召皮尔逊到华盛顿举行秘密会议，讨论西欧“重整军备计划执行迟滞不前的情况”，以及“加强执行北大西洋公约重整军备计划的方法”。皮尔逊在接受艾奇逊的指示后，定于九日赴西欧，参加一连串北大西洋公约组织会议。
    皮尔逊西欧之行，表明美国与西欧国家间在扩军备战速度上的矛盾正日趋尖锐。由于西欧各国严重的经济危机，以及由于各国人民强烈反对扩军备战政策，西欧各国政府最近都不得不放慢扩军的步伐。美联社伦敦八月二十三日电综述西欧各国情况说：“盟国重整军备的工作，无论在英国或在欧洲大陆，都正在松懈下来。……各国的情况是：减缩防务预算，放宽军备计划实施时期，缩短兵役期限。”
    西欧国家不仅在本国范围内削减扩军计划，而且纷纷要求召开北大西洋集团理事会会议，来正式修改今年二月北大西洋集团理事会里斯本会议所通过的扩军计划。在八月初，挪威和其他几个西欧国家就要求北大西洋集团理事会在九月举行会议。至九月初，法新社华盛顿消息透露，英国外交大臣艾登又建议北大西洋集团理事会在最近将来举行会议，修改里斯本计划。
    这种情况使美国大为惊慌。美国一方面竭力反对在九、十月举行北大西洋集团理事会会议，坚持这个会议应延至十二月举行。另一方面，美国从各方面使用压力，来迫使西欧各国继续加紧扩军备战。在北大西洋集团理事会常设委员会八月二十日会议上，美国代表德莱柏即大声警告西欧各国说：“任何成员国都不应严重地落后于它的防务目标。”现在，美国派遣皮尔逊至西欧活动，就是进一步向西欧各国使用压力的措施。
    但是，美国所依靠的使用压力的手段显然并不能解决西欧各国统治集团所面临的问题。连衔命赴欧的皮尔逊于九月二日在多伦多发表的演说中也承认：北大西洋公约成员国“所遭到的严重的经济与财政困难比它们原来预料的要多”。的确，西欧各国统治集团不得不削减扩军计划的根源，正是由于这种计划已给它们带来了日益恶化的经济及政治危机。对于这些危机，美国又能拿出什么应付的办法来呢？
