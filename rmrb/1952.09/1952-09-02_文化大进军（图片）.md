    Cultural Great Advance
    By Peng Bin and Sun Hanchun
    Seven. Arrived at the military region's accelerated literacy experimental class, and officially started classes on August 6th. At the beginning, the teacher didn't lecture from the book, but first taught "foreign language." I asked him what was the purpose of teaching this "foreign language." The teacher said, "This is not a 'foreign language,' it is phonetic symbols. It's like a sign hanging on the body of unfamiliar characters, so you can recognize any character." While teaching, he explained, and in less than forty minutes, everyone had learned it.
    Eight. After teaching the phonetic symbols, the teacher gave each person a phonetic symbol chart, cut into thirty-seven small pieces according to the squares on the chart, with one symbol on each piece of paper, and asked us to practice "moving house." I am the mutual aid group leader, and the group members include Wang Xuewen, Li Yushan, and Zhou Dabao. Everyone was very enthusiastic. You take this symbol and ask me to recognize it, and I take another one and ask you to recognize it. By the end of the class, we were familiar with all thirty-seven symbols.
    Nine. Even forty-year-old Wang Xuewen only had two symbols left that he wasn't familiar with. In August, it was terribly hot. Old Wang was only concerned with practicing "moving house," and didn't even notice the sweat dripping down his face. He said, "In front of Communists, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. We must bring out the spirit of climbing snow mountains and crossing grasslands, and we can learn even if we are taught ten more. "This spirit of hard study moved everyone. By night, he had learned them all.

    七、到了军区速成识字实验班，八月六日正式上课。教员一开始不讲书，先教的“洋文”，我问他教这洋文干啥，教员说：“这不是‘洋文’，是注音符号，它好比牌子，挂在生字身上，什么字都能认了。”他一边教，一边讲，不到四十分钟就把大家都教会了。
    八、教完注音符号，教员发给每人一张注音符号表，按照表上方格剪成三十七小块，一块纸片上一个符号，叫我们练习“搬家”。我是互助组长，组员有王学文、李玉山、周大保，大家兴致真高，你拿这个符号要我认，我再拿一个叫你认，下课时，就把三十七个符号搬熟了。
    九、四十多岁的王学文也只剩“历?”两个符号不熟。八月天，热得要命，老王只顾练习“搬家”，汗水顺着脸往下流都不管。他说：“在共产党员面前是没有克服不了的困难，拿出爬雪山，过草地的精神来，再教十个也能学会。这种苦学的精神感动了大家。到晚上，他也全部学会了。
