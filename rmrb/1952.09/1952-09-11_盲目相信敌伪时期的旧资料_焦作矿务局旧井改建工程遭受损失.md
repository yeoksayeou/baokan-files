Blindly Believing Old Data from the Enemy and Puppet Regime
Jiaozuo Mining Bureau's Old Well Reconstruction Project Suffers Losses

    The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, under the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, blindly believed in old data left over from the enemy and puppet regime, and took a detour in the wellhead restoration and reconstruction project.

    In 1951, the amount of recoverable coal underground in the Lifeng Mine of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau was already small. In order to develop new coalfields, it was necessary to pass through a fault in the Lifeng Mine to exploit the coalfield in the southern district, and at the same time restore the No. 39 well, which had been flooded. Both projects started last December. However, before the project started, no detailed investigation and research or drilling were conducted, and no reliable data that could be used as a basis for design was obtained. Instead, they blindly believed in the old data left by British and Japanese imperialism, thinking that after passing the fault in the Lifeng Mine, they would encounter recoverable coalfields. As a result, after passing the fault, the geological conditions were still very chaotic, and there was a fault almost every 10 to 20 meters of excavation. The cost of mining such coalfields would be too high to be worthwhile, so normal production work could not be carried out. Now, drilling must be done again before determining how to mine. The No. 39 well drainage project also encountered the same situation. The project initially progressed very well, but reconstruction could not begin after the accumulated water was drained. The reason was that before drainage, based solely on the old data left by the enemy and puppet regime, it was believed that the geological structure was simple, and the restoration project could be carried out immediately after the water was drained. After the water was drained, drilling revealed a large fault with a drop of more than 100 meters to the west of the wellhead. Therefore, it was necessary to re-drill, clarify the detailed situation of the underground coal seam, and re-design before construction could begin. During this period, the wellhead drainage project still needed to continue as usual, otherwise the wellhead would be flooded again. The daily drainage cost alone, just for electricity, was 2.8 million yuan. Adding labor, management, equipment depreciation and other costs, 100 million yuan had to be paid every month. The No. 39 well drainage project was completed last December, but it is still draining water every day waiting for the design, and this waste has been significant over the past eight or nine months. And the problem of developing new coalfields for the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has not been solved.

    盲目相信敌伪时期的旧资料
    焦作矿务局旧井改建工程遭受损失
    中央燃料工业部所属焦作矿务局，盲目相信敌伪时期遗留下来的旧资料，在井口恢复改建工程中，曾经走了弯路。
    一九五一年，焦作矿务局李封矿井下可采煤量已经不多。为了开拓新煤田，就需要在李封矿通过断层，以便开采南区的煤田，同时恢复被淹没的三十九号井。这两项工程都在去年十二月开始了。但是，由于在工程开始之前，没有进行详细的调查研究和钻探，没有获得可作设计根据的确实资料，只盲目相信英、日帝国主义遗留下来的旧资料，以为李封矿断层过去后，就可遇到可采煤田。结果断层过去后，地层情况仍然十分紊乱，几乎每掘进一、二十公尺就有一个断层。这样的煤田开采起来成本太高，得不偿失，因之就不能进行正常的生产工作。现在，只有重新打钻，然后才能确定如何开采。三十九号井排水工程，也遇到同样情况。这项工程最初进行得十分良好，但是积水排干后仍不能开始改建。原因是排水之前，仅根据敌伪时遗留下来的旧资料，认为地质构造简单，水排干后马上就可以进行恢复工程。及至水排干后，经过钻探，发现井口西部有一个落差一百多公尺的大断层。因此，就不得不重新进行钻探，弄清地下煤层的详细情况，重新作出设计，而后才能施工。在这个期间，井口的排水工程就仍需照常进行，否则井口就要重被淹没。每天排水费用，仅就电力一项，即需二百八十万元，加上人工、管理、设备折旧等费用，每月须要支付一亿元。三十九号井排水工程去年十二月已经完毕，但是，直到现在还是每天排着水在等候设计，八九个月来这一笔浪费是很大的。而焦作矿务局开拓新煤田的问题也一直没有解决。
