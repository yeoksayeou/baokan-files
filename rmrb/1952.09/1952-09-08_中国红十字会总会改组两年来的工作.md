    The Red Cross Society of China Headquarters has been two years since its reorganization on September 8, 1950. Since the reorganization, the organization and cause of the new China Red Cross serving the people has emerged. In the past two years, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, based on the health direction of "prevention first" and the relief and welfare policy of "mobilizing and organizing the people to carry out self-help and help others," our Red Cross workers, with a brand-new and fighting posture, have stood at their posts and worked with the people of the whole country to participate in the construction of our great motherland. What work have we done?

    First, ideological construction and organizational construction are the main parts of our association's work in the past two years, which is also the fundamental issue from the old China Red Cross to the new China Red Cross. We once pointed out that the humanitarianism touted by the old China Red Cross was the product of the combination of imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism, which was hypocritical and contained toxins. Although it was a mass organization, it was not combined with the masses; although it hung the banner of "charity" and did some relief treatment work, it played a role in paralyzing and relaxing the masses' struggle by the reactionary ruling class. In sharp contrast, the new China Red Cross takes patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary humanitarianism as its guiding ideology. It is based on the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and serves the broad masses of the people. The reorganization from the old Red Cross to the new Red Cross has gone through a difficult process of transforming ideas and improving understanding.

    The old Red Cross relied on the "benevolence" and "American aid" of a few people of the ruling class, not on the people, so it lacked a mass base. The old Red Cross repeatedly emphasized that it was a "neutral," "international," and "supra-political" organization, a purely "medical organization" and "charitable institution." Therefore, the staff of the old Red Cross showed a strong pro-American ideology, sectarianism, and extreme liberalism. After the reorganization, the headquarters immediately convened the heads of some branches to Beijing for study, so that they could establish a mass viewpoint. Subsequently, a study to oppose liberalism and sectarianism was launched within the headquarters, and everyone studied documents related to "criticism and self-criticism." In the study, generally, criticism and self-criticism were carried out in connection with personal thoughts, pro-American thoughts were cleared, the views of dependence and grace were criticized, and the so-called "neutrality," "internationality," and "supra-politicality" of the Red Cross were criticized. Errors, etc., also deeply reviewed the wrong thoughts of "saving face," "valuing feelings," "talking about personal relationships," "treating people differently," "purely technical viewpoints," and "relief and welfare undertakings have nothing to do with politics," thus establishing love for the motherland and the masses, and turning pro-American into anti-American. At that time, many people proposed to organize medical and defense teams to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. They realized that the Red Cross must stand on the people's stand and rely on the people to have a future; they also realized that criticism and self-criticism is a weapon to correct mistakes and promote work, and proceeding from reality is the criterion of the new ideological method. Last May, under the unified leadership of the People's Government, a study campaign of "loyalty and honesty" was launched. In the study, the vast majority of Red Cross workers took a big step in distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, and further exposed and criticized the reactionary nature of the old Red Cross. The study of the united front within the agency from October to November last year made a powerful criticism of the hired views and the mentality of being a guest among the staff of the agency, thereby further establishing a correct work attitude and the idea of ​​being the master. In addition, the headquarters also concentrated 105 staff members from various branches to hold a political study training class. The staff of the headquarters and some branches responded to the government's call to participate in the land reform movement and went to the countryside to participate in land reform work, and received training in practice. All these studies have generally improved the ideological understanding and awareness of Red Cross cadres in various places, promoted a democratic style, and improved leadership.

    The gains from the "Three-Anti" movement study in the first half of this year were even greater. The comrades who participated in the study generally realized the essence of the bourgeoisie, exposed many specific facts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, drew a line between the bourgeois and proletarian ideology, and improved their vigilance against the erosion of the bourgeoisie. It greatly strengthened the concept of cherishing the people's public property and established the viewpoint of hard work, plain living, integrity, impartiality, and wholeheartedly serving the people. After the "Three-Anti," the agency presented a new atmosphere and a new style, greatly improving work efficiency. Almost all local branches have also carried out the same study, which is of more profound significance for the ideological transformation and improvement of Red Cross staff across the country.

    Organizational construction is roughly divided into rectification and development. At present, the branches that have completed the reorganization include Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, etc. There are 51, and two new ones have been established. A small number of branches are working hard to rectify their operations and strive to be fully reorganized in the shortest possible time.

    In order to make the Chinese Red Cross have a broad mass base and become a truly people's health and rescue organization, developing members is a very important step. At the end of 1951, we selected three branches with a good foundation and objective conditions—Tianjin, Wuhu, and Fuzhou—as pilot areas for developing members, in order to learn from them and promote them comprehensively. The Beijing branch is also concentrating its efforts on developing membership. These branches have established grassroots organizations and opened health and first aid training. Members of the Fuzhou branch have actively participated in the patriotic health campaign. The main experience in developing members is: First, the attention, promotion, and leadership of local governments and their health administrative departments to the development of membership is the central link in whether the development of membership can be carried out smoothly. For example, Xu Ya, the mayor of Fuzhou, Zhang Rongcai and Wang Zhuozu, deputy directors of the Municipal Health Bureau, and Huang Kaiyun, director of the Health Department of Fujian Province, personally led the work of developing members, so the Fuzhou branch achieved more significant results in developing members. Second, at the beginning of the development of membership, the responsible cadres of grassroots organizations should be properly resolved immediately. According to the experience of Fuzhou and Hangzhou, the persons in charge of grassroots organizations should be filled by the persons in charge of health centers in various regions or designated medical personnel. The development of members should first strive for medical personnel to join the association, which can make it easier for the branch to establish health and first aid organization training work. Factories, mines, schools, and institutions should all be widely developed. Third, the close cooperation and concerted efforts of various mass organizations are also an important condition in the work of developing members. For example, Cai Xiangnan, a women's committee member of a police station in Wuhu City's Democratic Women's Federation, took the initiative to help with publicity. Within a month, she developed 182 members alone.

    Second, medical and health prevention, treatment and rescue work are the central cause of our association in the past two years. According to incomplete statistics from hospitals, clinics, and domestic and foreign medical and defense teams of some branches, a total of 2,998,931 people have been diagnosed and treated, 19,097 births have been delivered, 43,830 prenatal examinations have been performed, 17,917 postpartum visits have been made, 215,078 X-ray fluoroscopies have been performed, 36,910 photographs have been taken, 54,570 surgeries have been performed, and 1,927,141 various tests have been performed. In addition, the medical and educational institutions of various branches were adjusted, 422 intermediate-level midwifery, nursing and other technical personnel were trained, 1,547 primary health personnel were trained, maternal and child health training courses were held, 4,867 maternal and child health workers were trained, 23 maternal and child health stations were established, 8,215 first aiders were trained, 191 first aid stations were established, and 28,744 people were treated.

    Seven international medical and defense service teams were organized for the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, with a total of 666 people (excluding some who continued to form teams after a short rest). The working time of each team is generally more than half a year (the longer time is more than a year). Except for the fourth team that is still continuing to serve in Korea, the others have completed their tasks and returned victoriously. The two domestic medical and defense service teams participated in the work of 812 people before and after, respectively participating in the medical and defense work of the Huai River migrant workers, ethnic minority areas in Hainan Island, and the old revolutionary base areas in Jiangxi. The Jiangxi team and the Hainan Island team are still continuing to work in their original places, and the Huaihe team has gone to northern Jiangsu to prevent and control local diseases. Last year, we also organized disaster relief medical and defense teams to go to the northeast to help the Liaodong flood area and the Lijiang earthquake area in Yunnan.

    All the comrades of the teams, whether in the Korean war zone or in remote villages in China, have shown a good style of hard work, responsibility, enthusiasm, activity, research and creation, and love for the wounded and sick. Many model examples have emerged: For example, the comrades of the Mentougou Health Station of the Beijing Branch ran to the home of a resident seven miles away in the middle of the night and rescued a lying-in woman who was in danger of dying at the hands of an old midwife, and patiently took care of the lying-in woman and the baby every day. The lying-in woman said with emotion: "If you had come earlier, I would not have lost four children in a row. Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can we have both people and wealth." Another example is that the Kunming Branch studied the advanced theory of Pavlov in the Soviet Union in half a year in 1951 and manufactured gecko and gecko tissue fluid, which was tested to more than 700,000 cubic centimeters, which has a certain effect on stomach and intestinal ulcers, neurasthenia and other diseases. Another example is that the comrades of the International Medical and Defense Service Team can think of various ways to overcome difficulties in their work in the difficult environment. They used mountain stones, trees, wreckage of enemy planes, and shrapnel to make operating rooms, foot-operated tap water hand-washing equipment, lifting operating tables, instrument tables, infusion racks, water storage tanks, etc., and used agricultural tools (jumping hoes) as plaster supports, etc., giving full play to collective creativity. For the sake of the wounded and sick, they donated 6,540 cubic centimeters of fresh blood, saving many critically ill patients and avoiding amputations and disabilities. Korean wounded and sick soldiers said gratefully: "You are our saviors." Thirty comrades were therefore awarded the title of model worker and received medals from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which further strengthened the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. The first and second medical and defense teams working in Hainan Island and Jiangxi, as well as the first and second medical and defense teams that originally worked in the Huai River and are now working in northern Jiangsu, also have many model examples, which will not be listed due to space limitations.

    Third, maintaining the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross, safeguarding world peace, and strengthening ties with the fraternal Red Cross Societies of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries are another important component of the work of the Chinese Red Cross.

    In the past two years, our delegation has traveled abroad four times to attend the following meetings: the 21st Council of Governors of the League of Red Cross Societies held in Monte Carlo, Morocco in October 1950, the second and third Executive Committees of the 21st Council of Governors of the League of Red Cross Societies held in Geneva, Switzerland in May and December 1951, and the 18th International Red Cross Conference and the 22nd Council of Governors of the League of Red Cross Societies held in Toronto, Canada at the end of July and early August this year. At these meetings, we introduced the great achievements of the new China in politics, economy, and culture to the Red Cross Societies of various countries, as well as our consistent and unswerving efforts to maintain humanitarianism and safeguard world peace. We have repeatedly condemned the inhumane atrocities of the US military in Korea, such as indiscriminate bombing, killing civilians, abusing prisoners of war, harming Red Cross workers, and using poison gas bombs and germ warfare, which seriously violate the Geneva Conventions. At various meetings, we cooperated with the Red Cross Societies of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other fraternal countries to propose a ban on the use of atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons that massively kill human beings. We advocate abolishing the privileges of the International Committee of the Red Cross, so that the international Red Cross mechanism conforms to the principles of democracy and equality, and suggest that the League of Red Cross Societies should establish relations and close cooperation with the World Peace Council, and call on members of the Red Cross Societies of various countries to sign in support of the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty. In addition, we also called on the Red Cross Societies of various countries to provide relief to the people in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa who have suffered severe disasters. Although the above-mentioned suggestions and proposals have been manipulated, obstructed, and sabotaged by the US aggressors in many ways, due to the justice of our advocacy and in line with the requirements of peace-loving people all over the world, many of them have been passed. Even if some of them have not been passed, this is of great significance in exposing and combating the crimes of the imperialists.

    The Chinese Red Cross has always shown infinite concern and sympathy for the Korean people who are in the midst of war and disaster. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, we have issued 14 important statements to peace-loving people around the world and members of the Red Cross Societies of various countries, accusing and calling for an immediate end to the various atrocities of the US aggressors in Korea. We also protested against the atrocities of the British colonial authorities in Malaya in persecuting our overseas Chinese and supported the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" in Japan. In May this year, we donated 2 billion yuan to relieve the people in the disaster-stricken areas of India, extending the friendly hand of assistance from the Chinese people to the Indian people. All of these have won the enthusiastic support of peace-loving people in various countries.

    In order to learn from the advanced experience of the fraternal Red Cross Societies of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, our delegation has successively visited the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak Red Cross Society, which will not only enhance the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, but also further strengthen the forces to maintain humanitarian principles and safeguard world peace.

    In addition, in order to introduce the work of the headquarters and various branches, strengthen the guidance of the Red Cross affairs and business in various places, and popularize social health and health care publicity and education, the headquarters has published 19 issues of the "New China Red Cross" monthly magazine and 17 kinds of publicity brochures and picture albums, among which "First Aid" has the widest distribution. It has now been published in four editions with a total of 60,000 copies, which has created favorable conditions for promoting first aid training. There are also many innovations in the health publicity work of various branches and medical and defense teams, such as the Qingpu Branch holding small-scale health exhibitions, the Neijiang Branch introducing the screening of health publicity slides in cinemas, the Beijing, Wuhu and other branches organizing slide propaganda teams, the Wuxi Branch holding regular health publicity broadcasts on the radio, and conducting labor protection and health publicity in factories. The first medical and defense team stationed in the Huai River used microscopes to conduct health publicity for migrant workers. All have won the welcome of the working people.

    In the past two years, the headquarters and branches have also established necessary work systems and personnel systems, and have made necessary adjustments in personnel. They have also conducted a comprehensive inventory of medicines, equipment, and other assets in the equipment warehouses of major cities. Generally speaking, in the past two years, the new China Red Cross has achieved results under the joint efforts of all parties. However, there are still many shortcomings and difficulties in the work that need to be overcome urgently. Among them, the more prominent ones are that the quality and quantity of cadres are still far from meeting the needs of the work, the middle-level organization has not yet been established, and the development of members has just begun. Therefore, the mass base of the Red Cross is still very weak, the organization of branches is not widespread enough, the headquarters' specific leadership and assistance to various branches and teams are not enough, social publicity is not widespread and in-depth enough, first aid training, maternal and child health care and health education are not as needed, and so on.

    We firmly believe that in the future, under the leadership of the people's governments at all levels, with the more active support and guidance of the health departments and health cadres at all levels, and with the Red Cross itself being better at relying on the strength of the masses and working harder, the new China Red Cross will surely successfully shoulder the glorious task of being a capable assistant to the government's health department. Let us unite more closely and work together for the cause of the new Red Cross and for more effectively cooperating with the great economic construction of the new China!

    中国红十字会总会改组两年来的工作
    中国红十字会总会会长　李德全
    中国红十字会总会自一九五○年九月八日完成改组到今天，已经两周年了。从改组的时候开始，就产生了为人民服务的新中国红十字会的组织和事业。两年来，在中央人民政府正确领导下，本着
    “预防为主”的卫生方向及“动员和组织人民实行自救助人”的救济福利方针，我们红十字会工作者，以崭新的、战斗的姿态，站在自己的岗位上，和全国人民同心协力，参加了我们伟大祖国的建设。我们进行了什么工作呢？
    首先，思想建设和组织建设是我会两年工作中的主要部分，这也是从旧中国红十字会到新中国红十字会的根本问题。我们曾经指出旧中国红十字会所标榜的人道主义是帝国主义、封建主义和资本主义思想相结合的产物，它是虚伪而含有毒素的。虽是群众团体，而未与群众结合；虽然挂着“慈善”招牌，做点救济性的治疗工作，但却起着反动统治阶级麻痹和松懈群众斗争的作用。与此恰正相反，新中国红十字会是以爱国主义、国际主义和革命人道主义为指导思想，它是建立在中国人民革命胜利的基础上，而又服务于广大人民的。从旧红十字会改组为新红十字会，其间曾经历了改造思想与提高认识的一段艰苦过程。
    旧红十字会依靠统治阶级少数人的“恩赐”和“美援”，不是依靠人民，因而缺乏群众基础。旧红十字会一再强调它自己是“中立性”的、“国际性”的、“超政治性”的团体，是单纯的“医疗团体”与“慈善机关”。因此，旧红十字会的工作人员表现着浓厚的崇美思想、宗派观念和极端自由主义。改组后总会即召集部分分会的负责人来京学习，使他们树立群众观点。接着在总会内又展开了反对自由主义与反对宗派主义的学习，大家钻研了有关
    “批评与自我批评”等方面的文件。在学习中，一般均能结合本人思想展开了批评与自我批评，清算了亲美思想，批判了依赖与恩赐观点，批判了对红十字会所谓“中立性”、“国际性”、“超政治性”等等错误的看法，也深刻地检讨了“爱面子”、
    “重感情”、“讲私人关系”、“对人不对事”、
    “纯技术观点”、“救济福利事业与政治无关”等等的错误思想，因而树立了对祖国对群众的热爱，变亲美为仇美。当时就有很多人提出组织医防队，参加抗美援朝工作。他们认识到红十字会必须站在人民立场，依靠人民，才有前途；也体会到批评与自我批评是改正错误、推动工作前进的武器，从实际出发，才是新思想方法的准则。去年五月在人民政府统一领导下，又开展了“忠诚与老实”的学习运动，在学习中，绝大多数红十字会工作者都在分清敌我界限上迈进了一大步，同时对旧红十字会的反动本质进一步进行了揭发与批判。去年十月至十一月机关内部关于统一战线的学习，对机关工作人员中存在着的雇佣观点和作客思想作了一次有力的批判，从而也进一步地树立了正确的工作态度与主人翁思想。此外总会还集中各分会工作人员一百零五人，举办了一期政治学习训练班。总会和一部分分会的工作人员响应政府参加土地改革运动的号召，下乡参加了土地改革工作，在实际中得到了锻炼。所有这些学习都普遍地提高了各地红十字会干部的思想认识与觉悟水平，发扬了民主作风，改进了领导。
    本年上半年“三反”运动学习的收获更为巨大，参加学习的同志一般都认识了资产阶级的本质，暴露了许多贪污、浪费和官僚主义的具体事实，划清了资产阶级与无产阶级的思想界限，提高了对资产阶级侵蚀作用的警惕性，大大地加强了爱护人民公共财产的观念，树立了坚苦朴素、廉洁奉公和全心全意为人民服务的观点。“三反”后，机关里呈现了一片新气象和新作风，大大地提高了工作效率。各地分会几乎也全都进行了同样的学习，这对全国红十字会工作人员的思想改造与提高来说，是具有更深刻意义的。
    组织建设大体分为整顿与发展两方面，目前完成改组的分会有北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等……五十一个，新建立的两个，还有少数分会正在努力整顿业务，争取在最短期间全部加以改组。
    为了使中国红十字会具备着广泛的群众基础，成为真正人民的卫生救护团体，发展会员是一个很重要的步骤。一九五一年末我们选择了事业基础与客观条件较好的三个分会——天津、芜湖、福州来作为发展会员的试办区，以便从中吸取经验，推广全面。北京市分会也正在集中精力，进行发展会员工作。这些分会已建立基层组织，开办卫生和急救训练。福州市分会的会员已积极参加爱国卫生运动。发展会员的主要经验是：一、当地政府及其卫生行政部门负责同志对发展会员工作的重视、推动和领导，是发展会员工作能否顺利展开的中心环节。如福州市许亚市长、市卫生局张荣彩、王灼祖正副局长和福建省卫生厅黄开云厅长等亲自领导了发展会员的工作，因此福州市分会发展会员工作的成绩较为显著。二、发展会员工作开始，应即妥善解决基层组织的负责干部问题。根据福州、杭州的经验，基层组织的负责人，应由各地区卫生所负责同志或指定医务人员充任。发展会员应首先争取医务人员入会，这可以使分会易于建立卫生与急救的组织训练工作。工厂、矿山、学校、机关均应普遍发展。三、各群众团体的紧密配合与通力合作，也是发展会员工作中一个重要条件。如芜湖市民主妇女联合会一位派出所的妇女委员蔡向南主动积极地帮助宣传，在一个月内她一个人就发展了一百八十二名会员。
    第二，医药卫生防治救护等工作，是我会两年来的中心事业。据部分分会的医院、诊所和国内外各医防队的不完整统计，两年来共诊病二百九十九万八千九百三十一人，接生一万九千零九十七人，产前检查四万三千八百三十人，产后访视一万七千九百十七次，X光透视二十一万五千零七十八次，摄影三万六千九百一十次，手术五万四千五百七十次，各种检验一百九十二万七千一百四十一次，接种牛痘二百九十二万四千四百六十二人。此外并调整了各分会的医疗机构和教育机构，训练了中级助产、护理等技术人员四百二十二人，初级卫生人员一千五百四十七人，举办了妇幼保健训练班，培养了妇幼保健员四千八百六十七人，成立了妇幼保健站二十三处，训练了急救员八千二百一十五人，成立了急救站一百九十一处，救治了二万八千七百四十四人。
    为抗美援朝而组织的国际医防服务大队有七队，共六百六十六人（其中一部分经过短期休息，又继续组队的未计在内）。各队工作时间一般在半年以上（时间长的达一年多），除第四大队现仍在朝鲜继续服务外，其他都已完成任务胜利归来。国内两个医防服务大队，前后参加工作的人数八百一十二人，分别参加治淮民工保健、海南岛少数民族地区和江西老区的医防工作，江西队和海南岛队仍在原地继续工作，淮河队已去苏北防治地方病。去年我们也组织了救灾医防队，前往东北救助辽东水灾区和云南丽江地震区。
    所有各队工作同志，不论在朝鲜战地或国内偏僻村镇，大都表现出刻苦、负责、热情、积极、钻研创造和爱护伤病员的优良作风，涌现不少模范事例：如北京分会门头沟保健站的同志在深夜里跑到七里外的居民家里，抢救了在旧产婆手下险遭死亡的产妇，并耐心地每天去照顾产妇和婴儿。产妇感动地说：“若是你们早来的话，我不会一连死掉了四个孩子，只有在毛主席领导下，我们才能人财两旺。”又昆明分会在一九五一年以半年的时间研究了苏联巴甫洛夫的先进学说，制造了壁虎和蛤蚧组织液，试用至七十万公撮以上，这对肠胃溃疡、神经衰弱等症皆有一定的效果。又如国际医防服务队的同志们在艰苦的环境中，能在工作上想出各种克服困难的办法。他们利用山石、树木、敌机残骸和弹片等做成手术室，制成脚踏式自来水洗手装备、升降手术台、器械台、输液架、蓄水箱等，并利用农具（跳式锄头）作石膏支架等，发挥了集体创造性。他们为了伤病员，曾献出六千五百四十公撮鲜血，救活了不少危急的伤员，避免了截肢与残废。朝鲜伤员感激地说：“你们是我们救命的恩人。”有三十位同志因此而荣获模范工作者的称号，并得到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的奖章，从而更加强了中朝两国人民的战斗友谊。到海南岛和江西工作的以及原在淮河现去苏北工作的第一第二两个医防大队，也都有很多模范事例，限于篇幅不再多举。
    第三，维护红十字的人道主义原则，保卫世界和平，加强与苏联及各人民民主国家底兄弟红十字会间的联系，是中国红十字会工作的另一个重要组成部分。
    在过去两年中我会代表团曾先后出国四次，出席下列各会议：一九五○年十月在摩洛哥蒙特卡罗举行的红十字会协会第二十一届理事会，一九五一年五月和十二月在瑞士日内瓦举行的红十字会协会第二十一届理事会第二和第三次执行委员会，今年七月底到八月初在加拿大多伦多举行的第十八届国际红十字大会和红十字会协会第二十二届理事会。在这些会议上，我们向各国红十字会介绍了新中国政治、经济和文化各方面的伟大成就，以及一贯为维护人道主义与保卫世界和平进行坚持不渝的努力。我们屡次谴责美国军队在朝鲜滥施轰炸，屠杀平民、虐待战俘、残害红十字工作者，使用毒气弹和细菌战等严重破坏日内瓦公约的非人道暴行。我们在各次会议上与苏联、波兰等各兄弟国家红十字会合作，提议禁止使用大规模残杀人类的原子武器和细菌武器。我们主张取消红十字国际委员会的特权，使国际红十字会机构符合于民主与平等的原则，并建议红十字会协会应与世界和平理事会建立关系、密切合作，号召各国红十字会会员签名拥护缔结五大国和平公约。此外，我们并号召各国红十字会救济东南亚、中东和北非等地区遭受严重灾荒的人民。上述这些建议与提案，虽有美国侵略者多方操纵阻挠与破坏，但由于我们主张的正义性并符合全世界爱好和平人民的要求，仍有许多是通过了，有些即使未获通过，但这在揭发和打击帝国主义者底罪恶上是有重要意义的。
    对于正处于战争灾难中的朝鲜人民，中国红十字会经常寄予无限的关怀和同情。朝鲜战争爆发以来，我们曾向全世界爱好和平人民与各国红十字会会员发出过十四次重要声明，控诉并呼吁立即制止美国侵略者在朝鲜的各种暴行。我们并曾抗议马来亚英国殖民当局迫害我侨胞的暴行，声援日本“松川事件”无辜被告者。今年五月，我们捐款二十亿元救济印度灾荒地区人民，向印度人民伸出中国人民友谊援助之手。所有这些，都博得了各国爱好和平人民底热忱拥护。
    为了吸取苏联和各人民民主国家兄弟红十字会的先进经验，我会代表团相继访问过苏联红十字及红新月联合会与捷克斯洛伐克红十字会，这不仅将增进中国人民和苏联及各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊，也将进一步地加强维护人道主义原则与保卫世界和平的力量。
    此外，为了介绍总会及各分会的工作情况，加强对各地红十字会会务与业务的指导，普及社会卫生与保健等方面的宣传教育工作，总会已出版“新中国红十字”月刊十九期，宣传小册与画册十七种，其中以“急救”之发行面为最广。现已出四版共六万册，这为推进急救训练工作创立了有利的条件。各分会及医防大队卫生宣传工作方面也有不少创造，如青浦分会举行小型卫生展览，内江分会介绍电影院播演卫生宣教幻灯，北京、芜湖等分会组织幻灯宣传队，无锡分会在电台定期举行卫生宣传广播，在工厂举行劳保卫生宣传，驻淮河的第一医防大队利用显微镜向民工进行卫生宣传等。都获得了劳苦大众的欢迎。
    两年来，总会与分会也都建立了必要的工作制度、人事制度，并在人事方面进行了必要的调整，对各大城市器材库的药品器械等资财也进行了普遍的清查。总起来说，两年中新中国红十字会在各方面共同努力之下是有成绩的。但在工作中迄今也还存在着不少急待克服的缺点和困难。其中较突出者如目前干部质量和数量还远赶不上工作需要，中层组织还没有建立起来，发展会员刚在开始。因此，红十字会的群众基础还很薄弱，分会组织还不够普遍，总会对各分会及各大队的具体领导与帮助还不够，社会宣传不够普遍深入，急救训练、妇幼保健和卫生教育做得还赶不上需要，等等。
    我们深信，今后新中国红十字会在各级人民政府领导下，在各级卫生部门与卫生干部更积极地支持与指导下，在红十字会本身更善于依靠群众力量与更加努力工作的情况下，定能胜利地担负起作为政府卫生部门得力助手的这一光荣的任务。让我们大家更紧密地团结在一起，为着新红十字会事业、为着更有效地配合新中国的伟大经济建设而共同努力奋斗吧！
