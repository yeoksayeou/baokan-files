The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is open to traffic. This is the first railway built by the Chinese people themselves with domestic equipment, and it is also the fastest, best-engineered, and least expensive railway in China's railway history. Every huge bridge, tunnel, and culvert project, every railroad spike, switch, steel rail, and the origin of every sleeper embodies the wisdom and hard work of the Chinese people and demonstrates the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

In the past, China's railway equipment always relied on supplies from Europe and the United States. Not only steel rails and switches, which were valuable equipment, but even sleepers and railroad spikes had to be bought from foreign countries. At the beginning of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, many people believed that the equipment for more than 500 kilometers of railway was an insurmountable difficulty. Especially steel rails, some people insisted that "China cannot manufacture them." The reason was that "there is no precedent in history for using Chinese steel rails to build railways." China has many large forests, but some people insisted that "Chinese trees cannot be used to make sleepers." The reason was that "foreigners said so." These theories were finally overturned by the practice of the revolutionary people.

During my time in the Southwest, I personally observed the railway lines carefully. Every steel rail I saw was a product of Chongqing Factory 101. How could Factory 101 manufacture all these steel rails? This factory only had one rolling mill that could produce steel rails, which was bought sixty years ago. It had been idle in the Hanyang Arsenal for decades. Later, it was moved to Chongqing and left in the wilderness. This time, when Factory 101 received the task of manufacturing steel rails, no one dared to be sure whether the rolling mill could be used. At this time, responsible comrades from the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government and Soviet experts came. After inspecting the rolling mill, they determined that as long as it was slightly modified, it could roll out standard steel rails. The workers were happy to hear this and said, "We are liberated, and this 'old hen' that has been lying down for sixty years should also turn over. Hurry up and lay an egg!" The workers and Soviet experts worked together to move the machine out, designed the site, and modified the steel furnace and other parts that needed to be modified. On May 10, 1950, the first steel rail self-made by workers in the Southwest was born. The whole factory cheered, and the staff unanimously shouted that they would fight to supply all the steel rails needed for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

However, at that time, the workers' skills were still very unskilled. Although they hoarsened their voices and reddened their eyes, their work efficiency was still very low. In the later period of 1950, 57% of the time had passed, but only 15.3% of the task had been completed. According to the railway bureau's plan, it was necessary to open to traffic to Zhuyangxi (125 kilometers from Chongqing) that year. If the production of steel rails could not be increased, the plan for that year could not be completed, and it would affect the construction of the entire railway. Seeing the importance of their responsibility, the glorious steel workers were determined to improve their skills, launch a production competition, and ensure the completion of the steel rail production task. The trade union and the administration signed the first collective contract, and each production team formulated its own guarantee plan. Engineers went deep into the workshops to find ways to improve technology, straightening workers put forward new operating methods, transportation workers improved transportation efficiency, and workers in the maintenance team closely guarded the machines. The workers unanimously declared: "The workshop is the battlefield, and no victory is not a hero." This heroic spirit and selfless labor enthusiasm finally enabled them to complete the task on time that year, until all the steel rails needed for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were completed. The steel rails produced here, like the steel rails laid on other railways, are also standard rails weighing 42 kilograms. Some of them are new, Soviet-style standard rails, which are now laid on the western section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

In solving the difficulty of 1.25 million sleepers, the leading organs in the Southwest first criticized the fallacy that "Chinese trees cannot be used to make sleepers," and then launched a mass movement to dedicate and sell sleepers in dozens of counties along the railway line. The broad masses of peasants enthusiastically responded to the call of the People's Government and selected the best and largest trees to dedicate and sell to the state. An old man named Zhou in a certain county in southern Sichuan cut down the trees he had cultivated all his life, which he had prepared to keep as "longevity wood," and personally sent them to the railway bureau's inspection personnel. Many counties initially thought that the tasks assigned to them were large; but after the peasants were mobilized, they repeatedly asked to add tasks. Rongchang County's original task was 38,000 sleepers, to be completed in one and a half months, but it was all delivered in 20 days. Hejiang County's original task was 20,000 sleepers, which was automatically increased to 43,000 sleepers. Baxian County delivered an additional 15,000 sleepers after completing its original task. These sleepers are of excellent quality, many of which are Phoebe and camphorwood, and the worst are pine and cypress. These are the best sleepers on China's existing railways.

The solution of the difficulties of steel rails and sleepers increased confidence and courage in solving other equipment difficulties. Now, the railroad spikes and switches of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are engraved with the names of our factories. The brand-new carriages are marked with the words "Made by Tangshan Railway Factory" or "Produced by Sifang Railway Factory." There is nothing imported from imperialist countries here.

To complete such a long railway in two years is also a miracle in the history of Chinese railway construction, just in terms of time. This is the unanimous opinion of railway experts when talking about the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

There are many reasons for the rapid completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but the key lies in two things—the unprecedented increase in labor efficiency and the technical guidance of Soviet experts. On the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, no matter which section or which project, there were only early completions and large savings in labor, and no delays in delivery. Pan Zhaoyuan of the Baishuyao Tunnel Engineering Team is a technician who has been engaged in tunnel engineering for more than ten years and has excavated large tunnels in the Northwest and Yunnan. He said: "A large tunnel like Baishuyao, which is 630 meters long, would take at least two years according to past experience, but we completed it in one year. The actual labor efficiency of the workers always breaks through the calculations of the technicians. The Chengdu Engineering Section originally planned to use 6 million workers, but actually only used 4.8 million." Luo Chongfu, director of the construction bureau, said to me: "For such a difficult project as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, with the labor efficiency during the Kuomintang period, it would take eight years for the number of people we have now to complete the earthwork alone. But we actually completed the entire earthwork project in just one year. What is the reason?" He explained to me with specific examples. There are many mountains and hard rocks on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and the work of opening mountains and chiseling rocks is very arduous. At first, two people worked in a team to drill holes, advancing seven or eight meters a day; blasting required eight taels or even eleven and a half taels of explosives. Later, a civilian worker named Yan Shaogui created a new method of single-person blasting, and the efficiency of drilling holes was immediately increased to a new record of 24 meters per person per day. That is to say, now one person is equal to the labor of six people in the past. Another civilian worker, Xie Jiaquan, invented the pressure fuse blasting method, which reduced the amount of explosives used for each blast from the previous eight to eleven and a half taels to three and a half taels. This invention alone saved the state more than 5 billion yuan in explosives costs. Yan Shaogui and Xie Jiaquan's inventions inspired the civilian workers on the entire line. Xiao Guanghan, a 23-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, and his partners, after painstaking research, quickly surpassed Yan Shaogui with a record of 26 meters per day. Xiao Guanghan continued to study and further improved the drilling efficiency to 30 meters and 50 meters. That is to say, one person is equal to the labor of twelve to fifteen people. Xiao Guanghan's drilling record shocked many experts who had studied in Europe and the United States. At first, they did not believe it and said that the staff was bragging for Xiao Guanghan. But after forming a visiting group to inspect the site, they all said in unison: "It's really a miracle!" Other inventions and improvements, large and small, were also made in ramming and moving stones. More than a dozen styles of steel drills suitable for various rock qualities were invented just for hitting stones. Each invention improved labor efficiency and accelerated the progress of the project. According to statistics from the construction bureau, the labor efficiency of earthwork and stonework projects is, on average, three times higher than during the Kuomintang rule.

In the past, the roadbed projects of Chinese railways generally used the "natural settlement method," that is, after the roadbed was built and filled with loess, it was allowed to settle naturally for one or two rainy seasons before laying the rails. After laying the rails, it would go through one or two more rainy seasons before opening to traffic. In the early stage of operation, the speed could not exceed 10 kilometers per hour. This time, when constructing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Soviet experts proposed the "layered filling and ramming method" at the beginning of the roadbed construction—after the roadbed is made, ramming it once every five inches of soil is filled, until it reaches the required height. According to this method, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway built a very solid roadbed, and there was no need for settlement after the rainy season. Therefore, from the start of construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the roadbed was always built in the front, followed by laying rails, opening to traffic, and starting business. Now, trains are running at a speed of 45 kilometers per hour on the eastern and central sections of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The entire journey is only 20 hours.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which was designed by the Kuomintang in the past, was a narrow-gauge road of one meter, but now it has been widened to 1.435 meters according to the new standard. Many projects on the road have adopted advanced Soviet forms and standards. For example, the laying of steel rails has changed the traditional "staggered joint method" and adopted the "butt joint method" proposed by Soviet experts. The western section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been completely replaced with Soviet-style steel rails. Shims have been added to the sleepers there, and the number of railroad spikes on each sleeper has been increased from four to eight, which can extend the life of the sleepers by more than four times. Some important bridges, tunnels, and culverts have also been filled with "waterproof layers" according to the suggestions of Soviet experts. According to engineer Mei Pengchun of the Chengdu Engineering Section, "waterproof layers" are not only not available on other railways in China, but also rare on railways in European and American capitalist countries. This is a new invention in the Soviet engineering community. He used an analogy: bridges and tunnels without "waterproof layers" can be used for 50 years, while those filled with "waterproof layers" can be used for at least 200 years.

The Soviet experience is advanced not only because it can make the project solid, beautiful, and fast to repair, but also because it can reduce costs and expenses. The cost of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project under the guidance of Soviet experts is lower than any railway in China in the past. An engineer from the engineering department made a comparative calculation between the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and the result was that the average project per kilometer of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was seven times larger than that of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, but the cost was only equal to 20% of that of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. He and other engineers jointly compared the construction costs of all railways in China, and the conclusion was that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was the lowest. But according to this engineer, if we had followed the suggestions of Soviet experts completely from the beginning, we could have saved even more.

    我国人民用本国器材修成的第一条铁路
    本报记者  林里
    成渝铁路通车了。这是第一条由我国人民自己用本国器材修成的铁路，也是我国铁道史上修建最快、工程最好、用费最少的铁路。这里每一座巨大的桥梁、隧道和涵洞工程，每一件道钉、道岔、钢轨和枕木的来历，都表现出中国人民的智慧和勤劳，表明着中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。
    过去，我国的铁路器材从来都靠欧美供给。不仅钢轨、道岔那样贵重的器材，就是枕木、道钉都得到外国去买。成渝铁路动工之初，许多人认为五百多公里的铁路器材是不可克服的困难。特别是钢轨，有些人坚持说“中国不能制造”。理由是“历史上还没有用中国钢轨修铁路的先例”。中国有许多大森林，但有些人硬说“中国树木不能做枕木”。理由是“外国人这样说过”。这些理论，最后都被革命人民的实践推翻了。
    在西南的期间，我曾经亲自在铁路线上仔细观察过。我所看到的每根钢轨，都是重庆一○一厂的出品。一○一厂怎样能制造这全部钢轨的呢？这个厂只有一部能造钢轨的轧钢机，是六十年前买来的。它曾在汉阳兵工厂闲呆了几十年。以后移到重庆，又被丢在旷野蒿草里。一○一厂这次在接到制造钢轨任务的初期，谁也不敢断定轧钢机能不能使用。这时，中央人民政府重工业部的负责同志和苏联专家来了。他们把轧钢机检查了以后断定：只要稍加修改，就可以轧出合乎标准的钢轨来。工人们听了高兴的说：“解放了，这个躺了六十年的“老母鸡”也该翻身了。赶快起来下个蛋吧！”工人们和苏联专家一起把机器搬出来，设计了场址，修改了烘钢炉和其他应该修改的部分。一九五○年五月十日，西南工人自造的第一根钢轨出世了。全厂欢声雷动，职工们一致高呼，要为供给成渝铁路所需要的全部钢轨而斗争。
    可是，当时工人们的技术还很不熟练，虽然烤哑了嗓子，熏红了眼睛，工作效率还是很低。一九五○年后期，时间已经过去了百分之五十七，任务才完成了百分之十五点三。按照铁路局的计划，那年要通车到朱杨溪（距重庆一百二十五公里）。如果钢轨产量不能提高，当年计划即不能完成，并将影响整个铁路的施工。光荣的钢铁工人看到自己责任的重大，决心提高技术，开展生产竞赛，保证完成钢轨生产任务。工会和行政签订了第一个集体合同，各个生产小组制订了自己的保证计划。工程师深入车间寻找改进技术的门径，压直工人提出了新的操作法，运输工人提高了运输效能，保养班的工人紧紧守候在机器旁边。工人们一致宣誓：“车间就是战场，不获全胜不算英雄。”这种英雄气概和忘我的劳动热情，终于使他们按时完成了当年的任务，一直到完成成渝铁路所需要的全部钢轨。这里生产的钢轨，和其他铁路上铺的钢轨一样，也是四十二公斤重的标准轨。其中一部分是新型的，苏联式的标准轨，现在铺在成渝路的西段。
    在解决一百二十五万根枕木的困难上，西南领导机关首先批判了“中国树木不能做枕木”的谬论，然后就在铁路沿线几十个县发动了群众性的献卖枕木的运动。广大农民热烈响应人民政府的号召，纷纷挑选最好的和最大的树木献卖给国家。川南某县有一个姓周的老汉，把自己培植了一生，准备留做
    “寿木”的树砍了下来，亲自送给铁路局的验收人员。很多县开始时认为分配给自己的任务大；但在农民发动起来以后，他们却一而再地要求追加任务了。荣昌县原定任务是三万八千根，一个半月完成，结果二十天就全部送齐了。合江县原定任务两万根，自动增加到四万三千根。巴县在完成原定任务后，又额外增送一万五千根。这些枕木质量极好，很多都是楠木和香樟，最次的也是松、柏木。这是中国现有铁路上最好的枕木。
    钢轨和枕木困难的解决，给解决其他器材困难增加了信心和勇气。现在，成渝铁路的道钉、道岔上，都刻着我国的厂名。崭新的车箱上，标着“唐山铁路工厂制造”或“四方铁路工厂出品”的字样。这里没有一件是帝国主义国家输入的东西。
    两年内修通这样长的铁路，单就时间来说也是中国铁道建设史上的奇迹。这是铁路专家们在谈到成渝铁路时一致的舆论。
    成渝铁路迅速完工的原因很多，但决定的关键有两个——劳动效率的空前提高和苏联专家的技术指导。在成渝路上，不论那一段或那一个工程，只有提前完工和节省大量人工的，没有逾期不交工的。柏树坳隧道工程队的潘钊元，是个从事隧道工程十年以上的技术人员，曾在西北和云南等地凿过大隧道。他说：“像柏树坳这样六百三十公尺长的大隧道，按过去经验是至少需要二年时间的，但我们一年就完成了。工人们的实际劳动效率，总是突破技术人员的计算。成都工务段原计划用工六百万，实际只用四百八十万。”施工局的罗崇富局长对我说：像成渝路这样艰险的工程，照国民党时期的劳动效率，用我们现在这样数量的人，光土石方工程也得做八年。可是我们实际只用了一年时间便基本完成了全部土石方工程。什么原因呢？他用具体事例向我说明。成渝路上山多石硬，开山凿石工程十分艰巨。开初，打眼是两个人一班，每天前进七、八米；放炮要用八两甚至十一两半的炸药。以后民工颜绍贵创造了单人冲炮眼的新方法，打眼的效率一下就提高到一个人每天前进二十四米的新纪录。就是说，现在一个人等于过去六个人的劳动。另一民工谢家全，发明了压引线放炮法，使每次放炮的用药量由过去的八两至十一两半减为三两半。仅这
    一项发明，便给国家节省炸药费五十多亿元。颜绍贵和谢家全的发明创造，鼓舞了全路民工。二十三岁的青年团员萧光汉和他的伙伴们经过苦心研究，很快以每天前进二十六米的纪录超过了颜绍贵。萧光汉继续钻研，又使打眼效率提高到三十米，五十米。就是说，一个人等于十二个到十五个人的劳动。萧光汉的打眼纪录，震动了很多留学欧美的专家。开始他们不相信，说是工作人员替萧光汉吹牛。但在组成参观团到工地实地视察以后，他们都异口同声说：“真是奇迹！”其他像打夯，搬石头，也都有或大或小的发明创造或改进。仅打石头用的钢钎，就发明了适合各种石质的十多种样式。每一种发明创造，都提高了劳动效率，加速了工程的进展。据施工局统计，土石方工程的劳动效率，平均比国民党统治时期高三倍。
    过去中国铁路的路基工程，一般都用“自然沉落法”，就是打好路基，填起黄土，经过一个或者两个雨季的自然沉落，然后再铺轨。铺轨后再经过一个或者两个雨季，然后通车。初期行车时，速度不得超过十公里。这次修筑成渝铁路时，还在打路基的初期，苏联专家就提出“分层填土打夯法”的建议——路基做好后，每填五寸土打夯一次，直至填到应有的高度。依照这个办法，成渝路筑了极稳固的路基，而且用不着经过雨季的沉落。所以成渝铁路从动工开始，总是前边打路基，后面紧接着铺轨，通车，并开始营业。现在成渝铁路的东段和中段，列车都是以每小时四十五公里的速度前进着。全程也不过二十小时。
    国民党过去设计的成渝铁路，是一公尺的窄轨路，现在按照新的标准，放宽为一点四三五公尺。路上的许多工程，采用了先进的苏联形式和标准。如钢轨的铺垫改变了历来的“错接法”，采用了苏联专家建议的“对接法”。成渝路的西段，更全部换成了苏联式钢轨。那里的枕木上加填了垫板，每根枕木上由四个道钉增加为八个，这能使枕木寿命延长四倍多。一些重要桥梁、隧道和涵洞，又按苏联专家的建议加填了“防水层”。据成都工务段梅蓬春工程师谈，“防水层”不仅在中国其他铁路上没有，就是欧美资本主义国家的铁路上也不多见。这是苏联工程界的新发明。他打比方说：不加“防水层”的桥梁、隧道能用五十年，加填“防水层”后至少可用二百年。
    苏联的经验之所以先进，不仅因为它可以使工程坚固，美观，修得快，而且因为它能降低成本费用。在苏联专家指导下的成渝路的工程，成本比中国过去任何铁路都低。工务处一位工程师把成渝路和京汉路做了个对比计算，结果是：成渝路每公里的平均工程比京汉路大七倍，用费却只等于京汉路的百分之二十。他和其他工程师共同把中国所有铁路的建筑费用做了个对比，结论是成渝路最低。但据这位工程师谈，如果一开头就完完全全按照苏联专家的建议办事，我们还可以节省得更多。
