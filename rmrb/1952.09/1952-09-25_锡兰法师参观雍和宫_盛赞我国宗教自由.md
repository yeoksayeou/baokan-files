Xinhua News Agency, September 24th:

    The head of the Ceylon delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, Venerable Dhammaloka Thero, and the delegation member and secretary, Sanghatissa Thero, visited the famous Yonghe Temple shortly after arriving in Beijing. The representatives were warmly welcomed by the lamas. A little over four months ago, the lamas had received Venerable Saranamkara from Ceylon. When these two guests were in Ceylon, they had already heard Venerable Saranamkara talk about Yonghe Temple and the lamas' quiet and happy life; now, the representatives and the lamas greeted each other cordially like old friends.
    The main hall of Yonghe Temple has been renovated and looks brand new. The surrounding areas of several other ancient halls are full of building scaffolding, ready for complete renovation. Lama Nyima told Venerable Dhammaloka Thero: "Before liberation, the Kuomintang troops lived in the temple, destroying temples and statues, burning Buddhist scriptures, beating and scolding people. After liberation, the People's Government allocated 10 billion yuan to help us repair the temple, and we plan to repair the entire temple." The elder Grand Lama Yixi Gewa said: "Now we not only have religious freedom, but also can study culture. We also have representatives in the Beijing Municipal People's Congress. I have never seen such a good government in my life."
    Venerable Dhammaloka Thero was very interested in the similarities between the Buddha halls and those in Ceylon temples. In the main hall of Yonghe Temple, the Venerable visited the collection of Buddhist scriptures and personally presented a Buddha statue he brought from Ceylon to the Grand Lama of Yonghe Temple.
    During the break, Venerable Dhammaloka Thero said: After Venerable Saranamkara returned to Ceylon from China, he gave us a report that China has religious freedom. Today we have come here ourselves. I have never seen a government in any country take such care of Buddhists. From everything I have seen, I am completely convinced that Chinese Buddhists enjoy religious freedom. I am willing to convey this fact to the Buddhists in our country and do my best to make them recognize those untrue propagandas.
    The lamas knew that the two representatives had come to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and they asked with concern how the Buddhists and people of Ceylon were supporting peace. As the representatives were leaving, Grand Lama Yixi Gewa asked them to convey their regards to the people of Ceylon, saying: "When you return to Ceylon, please tell the Buddhists and people of Ceylon that we are living quietly and happily. We cherish our peaceful life very much and hope they will also work for peace. We all demand peace, and war can be avoided."

    锡兰法师参观雍和宫
    盛赞我国宗教自由
    【新华社二十四日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的锡兰代表团团长达马拉塔纳法师和代表团团员兼秘书桑姆加塔桑，在到达北京后不久就参观了著名的雍和宫。代表们受到喇嘛们的热烈欢迎。四个多月以前，喇嘛们曾接待过锡兰的撒拉南卡拉法师。这两位客人在锡兰的时候，就已听到撒拉南卡拉法师谈到雍和宫和喇嘛们安静而愉快的生活；现在，代表们和喇嘛们像老朋友一样亲切地互相问候。
    雍和宫的正殿已修葺得焕然一新，另外的几个古老的殿堂周围都搭满了建筑木架，准备全部加以修葺。喇嘛呢玛告诉达马拉塔纳法师说：“解放以前，国民党的军队住在庙里，毁坏庙宇和神像，焚烧佛经，打人骂人。解放以后，人民政府拨了一百亿元帮助我们修庙，我们准备把整个庙都修好。”年长的大喇嘛依什噶瓦说：“我们现在不但有信教自由，而且可以学文化，北京市人民代表会议也有我们的代表，我一生从来没有看到过这样的好政府。”
    达马拉塔纳法师对于佛殿里那些与锡兰庙宇中相似的地方很感兴趣。在雍和宫正殿里，法师参观了雍和宫的藏经，并把他远从锡兰带来的佛像亲自送给雍和宫的大喇嘛。
    在休息的时候，达马拉塔纳法师说：撒拉南卡拉法师从中国回到锡兰后，给我们作了一个中国有宗教自由的报告。今天我们又亲自到了这里。我还没有见到过那个国家的政府对于佛教徒有这样的照顾。从我所看到的一切，我完全相信中国佛教徒是享有宗教自由的。我愿意把这个事实传达给我国的佛教徒，并尽我所能使他们认清那些不符合事实的宣传。
    喇嘛们知道两位代表是来参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的，他们关心地问起锡兰佛教徒和锡兰人民是怎样拥护和平的。代表们临走时，大喇嘛依什噶瓦请代他们向锡兰人民致意，他说：“当你们回到锡兰以后，请告诉锡兰佛教徒和人民，我们生活得很安静，很愉快，我们非常珍爱我们的和平生活，希望他们也为和平而努力。我们大家都要求和平，战争就可以避免了。”
