Further, they should check the safety facilities of their factories and mines and strengthen labor protection work.

If serious problems are found and cannot be resolved, they must report to the Party Committee and report to the higher-level trade union organizations level by level. (3) Trade union organizations at all levels should organize forces to conduct spot checks on the study of documents and the inspection and improvement of safety facilities by grassroots trade unions in various factories and mines. Trade unions in major administrative regions and municipal federations of trade unions should report the situation to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
