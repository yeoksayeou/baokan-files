    The people of the capital are welcoming the third National Day with boundless excitement and joy.
    The ancient and magnificent city of Beijing is dressed in festive attire, and a scene of joy prevails throughout the city. The solemn and majestic Tiananmen Gate, meticulously repaired by workers day and night, has taken on a new look. The towering gate has been repainted in deep red, and all the painted decorations on the gate have been repainted. The surrounding palace walls have also been whitewashed. Under the bright sunshine, these crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese working people appear radiant and magnificent. Eight large red palace lanterns are hung under the corridor of the gate tower, adding to the festive atmosphere. A huge oil portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great founder of the People's Republic of China, hangs high on the red wall in the center below the gate. On both sides are slogans in horizontal rows with red backgrounds and gold edges, recently reinstalled: "Long Live the People's Republic of China!" "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World!" On the east and west sides of Tiananmen, two red slogan towers, more than three meters high, were erected, with the words "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" written on them respectively. Standing in the center of Tiananmen Square, you can see from afar the large characters "National Day" hanging high on the city gate of Qianmen in the south.
    In September, Beijing is particularly sunny. In the early morning, when the warm sunshine begins to shine on this happy city, people go to their work or study posts and begin their tense and happy life for the day. As everyone walks along the wide and clean tree-lined roads, they observe the changes on the streets with joy: the agencies, organizations, schools, and shops on both sides of the street have built colorful arches to celebrate National Day or hung red banners. In the center islands of the main streets, the grass is green, and huge slogan towers have been erected in the center. Many loudspeakers have been newly installed on the utility poles on both sides of the street, broadcasting pleasant music from time to time. From morning to night, people pass through the newly decorated streets, stepping lightly, and go to Tiananmen Square to sightsee.
    After nightfall, thousands of electric lights emit strong light from the eaves of the Tiananmen Gate, the red walls around the square, and the gate tower of Qianmen, illuminating the entire square and East and West Chang'an Avenue as if it were daytime. At this time, more crowds, carrying red flags, beating gongs and drums, or playing various musical instruments, happily walk to Tiananmen, where they enthusiastically sing and dance. People have endless and deep feelings for this square, which was once bathed in the blood and tears of the revolutionary people and has now become the center of joy in Beijing.
    At this moment, the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference is about to be held in Beijing, which adds a strong atmosphere of peace to the capital on the eve of National Day. In the streets and alleys of Beijing, lifelike and soaring white doves of peace are hung everywhere on the doors and windows of institutions, organizations, schools, shops, and ordinary households. The students of various schools in Beijing are preparing to express the strong will of the 2.5 million people of the capital to love peace and strive for peace through various images during the National Day holiday. The staff of the North China Agricultural Science Institute has long made a huge earth with green cloth, on which stands a pure white dove of peace, indicating that peace-loving people are all over the world, and the power of the people will overwhelm all conspirators of aggressive wars.
    Thanks to the great achievements our motherland has made on the economic front in the past three years, and the significant improvement in the lives of the broad masses of the people, the market in Beijing on the eve of National Day appears particularly active. Workers, farmers, women, and staff members celebrate their happy lives at the same time as they celebrate National Day. People flocked into state-owned department stores, retail companies, cooperatives, and private shops like a tide, selecting all the holiday supplies they could think of. Department stores extend sales hours every day, and the people who buy goods are still packed tightly. In the suggestion book, customers unanimously suggested expanding the store further. This year, on the eve of National Day, customers' "appetites" seemed particularly large. Wool sweaters, floral bed sheets, white sneakers, colored silks and other goods sold unprecedentedly well, and general sales increased by two or three times to seven or eight times. The sales of floral shirts soared tenfold. Sweaters, wool yarn, watches, and woolen cloth have also become best-selling goods this year. The improvement of people's purchasing power is most clearly seen on this National Day.
    People's happy life is created by their own labor. In order to welcome National Day and the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, the workers of the capital's factories and mines launched a production competition two months ago, and now there have been many new creations and examples of over-fulfilling production plans. The workers of each factory want to present their best products to Chairman Mao for review during the National Day holiday.

    国庆前夕的首都北京
    本报记者  林洪、江夏
    首都人民以无限兴奋和喜悦的心情迎接第三届国庆节。
    古老而壮丽的北京城披上了节日的盛装，城内到处呈现着欢乐的景象。庄严雄伟的天安门经过工人们日夜不息的精心修理，焕然一新。巍峨的门楼重新涂上了深红色的油漆，门楼上所有的和玺彩画都重新描绘过，四周的宫墙也粉刷一新。在明亮的阳光照耀下，这些中国劳动人民智慧的结晶显得容光焕发，金碧辉煌。在门楼的走廊下面，悬挂了八个大红的宫灯，更增加了节日的气氛。门楼下面正中的红墙上，高挂着中华人民共和国的伟大缔造者毛泽东主席的巨幅油画像。两旁是最近重新安装上的、红底金边的横排的标语：“中华人民共和国万岁！”“世界人民大团结万岁！”在天安门的东西两侧，树立了两个红色的、高达三丈余的标语塔，上面分别写着：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”站在天安门广场的中心，可以远远看见正南面前门的城楼上高挂着“国庆”两个大字。
    九月的北京，天气分外晴朗。清晨，当暖和的阳光开始照射着这幸福的城市时，人们各自走向自己工作或学习的岗位，开始自己一天的紧张愉快的生活。每一个人在走过宽阔、整洁的林荫马路时，都以喜悦的心情注视着街头的变化：街道两边的机关、团体、学校和商店搭上了庆祝国庆的彩色牌楼，或者挂上了红布标语。各主要街道的中央岛上，绿草如茵，正中心竖起了巨大的标语塔。街道两旁的电线杆上，新装了许多扩音机，时时播送出悦耳的音乐。从早晨到夜晚，都有人穿过装饰一新的街道，踏着轻快的步子，走向天安门广场去观光。
    入夜以后，天安门门楼的屋檐上，广场四周的红墙上，前门的门楼上，数千盏电灯发射出强烈的亮光，把整个广场和东西长安街照耀得如同白昼。这时，更多的人群打着红旗，敲着锣鼓，或是奏着各种乐器，愉快地走向天安门，在那里热情地歌舞。对于这个曾经沐浴过革命人民的鲜血和眼泪、而今变成了北京欢乐中心的广场，人们有着无穷深厚的感情。
    恰在此时，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将要在北京召开，使国庆前夕的首都，更增加了强烈的和平气氛。在北京的街头巷尾，无论是机关、团体、学校，或者是商店和一般住户的门窗上，随处都挂着栩栩如生、展翅高飞的和平白鸽。北京各学校的学生们，正准备在国庆节日通过各种形象来表达首都二百五十万人民热爱和平与争取和平的坚强意志。华北农业科学研究所的工作人员，早就用绿布作好了一个巨大的地球，上面站立着洁白的和平鸽，这表示爱好和平的人民遍布于全世界，人民的力量将压倒一切侵略战争的阴谋策划者。
    由于三年来我们祖国在经济战线上获得了伟大的成就，广大人民的生活有了显著的改善，国庆节前夕的北京市面显得特别活跃。工人、农民、妇女和机关工作人员在庆祝国庆节之际，同时庆祝自己幸福的生活。人们像潮水一样地涌进了国营百货公司、零售公司、合作社和私营商店，选购一切想得到的节日的用品。百货公司每天延长售货时间，购货的人们仍然挤得水泄不通。在意见簿上，顾客们一致的意见是把商店再扩大些。今年国庆前夕，顾客们的“胃口”显得特别大。绒衣、花床单、白运动鞋、彩绸等货品空前畅销，一般销售额都激增二、三倍到七、八倍，花衬衫的销额骤增十倍。毛衣、毛线、手表和呢料，今年也成了畅销货。人民购买力的提高，在这国庆节看得是最清楚不过了。
    人们的幸福生活，是用自己的劳动创造出来的。首都各工厂、矿山的工人们为了迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，前两月就掀起了生产竞赛的热潮，现在已经出现了许多新的创造和超额完成生产计划的事例。各厂工人们都想把自己最好的产品在国庆节日拿去受毛主席的检阅。
