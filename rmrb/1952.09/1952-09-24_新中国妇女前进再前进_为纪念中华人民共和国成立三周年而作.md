Forward, Forward, Women of New China
—Written in Commemoration of the Third Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation Deng Yingchao

On October 1st, three years ago, the People's Republic of China was born. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that shackles women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. Freedom of marriage between men and women is practiced." Various important laws promulgated after the founding of the People's Republic of China, such as the Marriage Law, the Land Reform Law, and the Labor Insurance Regulations, all embody this spirit, guaranteeing the equal rights of men and women in law from various different aspects. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the organizations of the Democratic Women's Federation at all levels, following the government's policies, mobilized and organized the broad masses of women to participate in social labor, so that women who had already participated in social production and social work worked even harder, and enabled women who had not been involved in production in the past to enter the positions of social production and social work, becoming creators of social wealth and builders of the new China. This not only helps the recovery and development of the motherland's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, but also fundamentally improves the social and family status of women; thereby removing the feudal shackles on women, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and children, and improving women's political, cultural, and professional levels. Therefore, in social reform movements and the country's various construction undertakings, the principle of mobilizing both men and women together, extensively absorbing women to participate, and protecting the legitimate interests of women was promoted. The target of the work of the Democratic Women's Federation organizations at all levels is mainly the working women in factories and rural areas and other working women who have been most oppressed and suffered the most in the past, while also paying attention to uniting women from all classes and all ethnic groups who love the motherland, love peace, and love democracy.

Over the past three years, the organizations of the Democratic Women's Federation at all levels, based on this policy, have cooperated with relevant departments of the People's Government and other people's organizations, dividing labor and cooperating, and jointly carrying out education and work among the masses of women. With the great victories of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the recovery and development of the country's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, the feudal system that shackles women is rapidly collapsing, and the status of the broad masses of women has undergone fundamental changes, from the oppressed and enslaved status of old China to becoming the masters of the new China, and is changing from a discriminated and humiliated position to becoming female citizens equal to men. Women's special needs, which were ignored and devastated in the past, have now received the care and protection of the state.

So, what specific achievements has the women's work of the new China achieved in the past three years?

First, the right to equality between men and women is being gradually realized. The awareness of the broad masses of women has been greatly improved. Their vision has expanded from the narrow family circle to the entire country. They love their families and love their motherland even more. They are actively participating in various social reform work and the country's various construction undertakings with a spirit of self-improvement and infinite enthusiasm, just like men. The number of departments and the number of participants are increasing year by year. Moreover, in state organs, schools, state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, state-owned farms, excellent agricultural production cooperatives, and the most advanced mutual aid teams, women have basically achieved equal status and equal treatment with men.

In terms of political power work, women participate in responsible work in people's governments at all levels, and a certain number of female representatives also participate in people's congresses at all levels, playing a certain role. The proportion of women in grassroots political power is the largest, and their role is the most significant. For example, in the People's Congresses of all circles in the counties, the number of female representatives this year accounts for about 15% of the total number of representatives, an increase of about 5% compared with 1950. In the street People's Congresses in Beijing, the number of female representatives this year accounts for 48% of the total number of representatives, an increase of 26% compared with 1950. In the grassroots People's Governments in rural areas, the number of women is also quite large. The vast majority of them serve the people wholeheartedly. Through them, the opinions and requirements of each family are reflected to the People's Government, and the laws and policies of the People's Government are implemented in each family, making the lower foundation of the people's democratic regime increasingly consolidated.

In terms of economic construction, not only do a large number of women participate in the light industry sector, but also new types of women have appeared in heavy industry, transportation, national defense construction, and other fields where few or no women participated in the past, such as female lathe workers, female drivers of streetcars, automobiles, and trains, female aviators, and parachutists. This has opened up a broad path for Chinese women to participate in the construction of the motherland. This year, the number of female workers in the country has reached 990,000, an increase of 74% compared with 1950. They are actively working with unparalleled enthusiasm, using their brains to find tricks, and learning and creating many advanced working methods. The work method of Hao Jianxiu, a nationally renowned female spinner, has now been popularized in the spinning sector, and female spinners are honored to learn and master Hao Jianxiu's work method. According to last year's statistics, more than 86,500 labor models emerged among the employees in the country, of which female labor models accounted for about 8.9%.

In state-owned enterprises, many female workers have been promoted to leading cadres. In the Northeast and East China regions alone, more than 6,400 people have been promoted to enterprise management cadres (workshop directors, section chiefs, factory directors, etc.) and trade union leaders since liberation. The system of equal pay for equal work for men and women has been universally implemented in state-owned enterprises, and the amount of wages is increasing year by year. Labor insurance has been implemented in enterprises with more than 100 employees since 1951, and special care has been given to the special difficulties of female workers.

In areas with a population of more than 420 million agricultural people, land reform has been completed, and rural women have been allocated a piece of land and become the masters of the land. The liberated farmers, both men and women, are working on their own land with incomparable joy; in most rural areas, more than 60% of the able-bodied women participate in field labor, and in some areas it is as high as 90%. This year, the number of women participating in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations has reached 40% to 60% of the total number of women participating in agricultural production. Among them, many outstanding model workers with high yields have emerged, such as Leng Yueying and others, who are nationally renowned and won awards from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.

With the development of rural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, childcare groups and nurseries for busy farming seasons have also been organized and developed, which has alleviated the difficulties of some rural women in taking care of their children; and the knowledge of new methods of delivery and new methods of childcare has been promoted, improving the health work of women and children in rural areas; literacy classes and newspaper reading groups have been held, improving women's cultural level. Many women have been promoted to leadership positions and have become team leaders and cooperative directors (for example, in the 118 agricultural cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi, there are 95 female directors and deputy directors). Therefore, the female members of the agricultural production cooperative said with emotion: "Participating in the production cooperative, the old and the young are healthy, both people and wealth are prosperous, which can not only get rich, but also liberate women, which is much better than working alone." In addition, attention has been paid to training female agricultural technical cadres, so that they can learn to use new agricultural implements. Female tractor drivers and female farm managers have appeared in state-owned farms.

In terms of cultural education and labor employment, women have obtained the same rights as men. In the nationwide rapid literacy movement, there are more women than men in some study classes; in higher education, since the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government expanded the student aid system, it has fundamentally ensured that both men and women have equal opportunities for admission and are no longer restricted by "male superiority over female inferiority." In terms of labor employment, special care is given to women in accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on labor employment issues. The number of female staff members in state organs is increasing year by year (female staff members in the organs of the Central People's Government this year account for 22% of the total number of staff members, an increase of 4% compared with 1949), and equal pay for equal work has been implemented, and maternity leave is implemented before and after childbirth, and wages are paid as usual.

Second, the right to freedom of marriage has been legally guaranteed, and democratic and harmonious families are gradually emerging. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law on May 1, 1950, the Government Administration Council has promulgated instructions on checking the implementation of the Marriage Law, legally guaranteeing the people's right to freedom of marriage. People's governments and people's organizations at all levels have conducted publicity and education on the Marriage Law among the masses, and have checked the implementation of the Marriage Law. In areas where the work is done well, arranged and mercenary marriages have been basically eliminated, and women have freedom to marry, divorce, and remarry. The standard for people to choose love objects is diligence in production and progressive thinking; new democratic and harmonious families are appearing everywhere. For example, in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui, from January to August this year, there were more than 8,700 free marriages in the entire region, more than 3,000 widows remarried, more than 95,300 democratic and harmonious families, and more than 2,400 young men and women happily resolved their marriage problems. They sang: "Land reform turned over, mutual aid and cooperation planted the roots of wealth; voluntary marriage, women live like human beings." As a result, women are active and active in political, cultural, and production aspects.

However, the work in most areas is still poor, especially the old judicial personnel who are directly responsible for implementing and publicizing the Marriage Law and the male and female cadres who retain feudal ideas, which seriously hinder the implementation of the Marriage Law. Eliminating the feudal ideas of these personnel is the key to the universal implementation of the Marriage Law.

Third, attention has been paid to the protection of mothers and children. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates the protection of the health of mothers, infants, and children. The Labor Insurance Regulations also made special protection regulations for female workers and family members of workers before and after childbirth. Female workers and family members of workers enjoy the same protection for birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability. The relevant departments of the People's Government, the organizations of the Democratic Women's Federation at all levels, and the National Committee for the Protection of Children of the Chinese People are working hard in accordance with this policy. Therefore, in the past three years, women and children's health and welfare undertakings have developed vigorously, and the childcare organizations and women and children's undertakings run by state organs, state-owned enterprises, and rural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives are the largest in number and the fastest in development. According to statistics from 30 provinces, 13 cities, 2 administrative office areas, and 1 ethnic autonomous region, there are more than 65,500 childcare organizations (including nursing rooms, kindergartens, nurseries, nurseries, nursery stations, and busy farming season childcare organizations), with more than 457,000 children in care. The number of factory, organ, and rural childcare organizations has greatly increased and developed compared with the past. There are currently more than 21,000 women and children health institutions in the country, and a total of 173,000 trained health workers, midwives, and reformed old midwives. The Soviet pain-free childbirth method is being successfully promoted step by step in cities. Thanks to these efforts, the child mortality rate has gradually decreased, and the health of mothers and children has been improving day by day, which has greatly encouraged women's enthusiasm for production. Looking at the past three years, the equal rights and special protection that women in our country have obtained, and the great power shown by women under the cultivation and love of the state, prove the superiority of the people's democratic system. However, only a short three years have passed since the founding of the new China, and the feudal remnant ideas of male superiority over female inferiority left over from the old China for thousands of years cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time. Therefore, the policy of equality between men and women still requires long-term struggle, continuous overcoming of difficulties, and elimination of obstacles in order to be fully implemented. To this end, we should widely and deeply publicize the policy of equality between men and women to the entire people, oppose the feudal remnant ideas of male superiority over female inferiority, so as to better play the potential strength of women and participate in the great construction work of the motherland. We women must actively respond to the call of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and under its leadership, further unite and organize, prepare knowledge and skills, and welcome the large-scale economic construction and cultural construction undertakings that are about to begin, actively build the motherland, lay the foundation for national industrialization, and strive for the complete liberation of women.

Women's federations at all levels should more closely connect with the masses of women, better serve them, care about the work, life and sufferings of working women, focus on developing women and children's health undertakings, vigorously implement the Marriage Law and support their just struggle. To this end, it is necessary to better use the form of women's representative conferences, cultivate more activists on the existing basis, better play its role as a link, unite the broader masses of women, and actively participate in the construction of the new China.

We deeply know that only in a peaceful environment can we smoothly carry out the above work and happily live an equal and happy life; therefore, we must devote ourselves to the cause of peace with unparalleled enthusiasm, strive for peace, defend peace, and stop wars of aggression. Let us and all peace-loving people and women in the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, closely join hands, unite as one, and make unremitting efforts to defend peace and stop wars. For a happier tomorrow, for our lofty ideals, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, following the path of the Soviet people and women towards complete liberation, move forward with confidence, enthusiasm and vigor, from victory to greater victory.

    新中国妇女前进再前进
    ——为纪念中华人民共和国成立三周年而作
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席  邓颖超
    在三年前的十月一日，中华人民共和国诞生了。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中明确规定了“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由。”中华人民共和国成立以后公布的各项重要法令，如婚姻法、土地改革法、劳动保险条例等，均贯串了这种精神，从各个不同的方面，在法律上保障了男女平等的权利。在中国共产党领导之下，民主妇女联合会的各级组织，遵循着政府的政策，发动和组织广大妇女参加社会劳动，使已经参加社会生产、社会工作的妇女，更加努力生产和工作，使过去不事生产的妇女，进入社会生产、社会工作的岗位，成为社会财富的创造者及新中国的建设者。这样既能有助于祖国的政治、经济、文化事业的恢复与发展，又能从根本上提高妇女的社会和家庭地位；从而解除对妇女的封建束缚，保护妇女儿童的合法利益，提高妇女的政治、文化和业务水平。因此，在社会改革运动和祖国的各项建设事业中，提倡了男女一齐发动，大量吸收妇女参加，保护妇女合法利益的方针。民主妇女联合会各级组织工作的对象，主要是过去受压迫最重，受苦最深的工农妇女及其他劳动妇女，同时注意团结各阶层各民族爱祖国、爱和平、爱民主的妇女。
    三年来，民主妇女联合会的各级组织，本此政策方针，与人民政府有关部门及其他人民团体，分工合作，共同在妇女群众中进行教育，开展工作。随着抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命和“三反”
    “五反”运动的伟大胜利，国家政治、经济、文化事业的恢复与发展，束缚妇女的封建制度正在迅速的崩溃中，广大妇女群众的地位起了根本的变化，从旧中国的被压迫被奴役的地位变成了新中国的主人翁，并且正在从被歧视被屈辱的地位，变成和男子平等的女公民，妇女们的特殊要求，过去是被漠视被摧残的，今天已得到了国家的关怀和保护。
    三年来，新中国的妇女工作取得了那些具体的成绩呢？
    第一、男女平等的权利，正在逐步实现。广大妇女的觉悟大大提高了，她们的眼光已经从狭小的家庭圈子里扩展到整个国家，她们热爱自己的家庭，更爱自己的祖国，正以自强奋发的精神和无限的热情和男子同样积极地参加各种社会改革工作和祖国的各项建设事业。参加的部门和参加的人数，正在逐年增加。而且在国家机关、学校、国营企业、合作社、国营农场、优秀的农业生产合作社和最先进的互助组中，妇女们基本上已经和男子取得了平等的地位同等的待遇。
    在政权工作方面，各级人民政府中都有妇女参加负责的工作，各级人民代表会议中也都有一定数量的女代表参加，起了一定的作用。在基层政权中妇女所占的比例最大，作用最为显著，例如县各界人民代表会议中，今年女代表数约占代表总额的百分之十五，比一九五○年约增加了百分之五。北京市街道人民代表会议中，今年女代表数占代表总额的百分之四十八，比一九五○年增加了百分之二十六，在农村基层人民政府中，妇女的数量也相当的多。她们之中绝大多数忠心耿耿为人民服务，通过她们把每一个家庭的意见和要求反映到人民政府中去，又把人民政府的法令政策贯彻到每一个家庭中去，使人民民主政权的下层基础日益巩固。
    在经济建设方面，不仅轻工业部门有大量的妇女参加，就是过去很少妇女或者没有妇女参加的重工业、交通事业、国防建设等方面，也出现了新型的妇女，如女盘镟工，电车、汽车、火车的女司机，女航空员及跳伞员等等，为中国妇女开辟了参加祖国建设的宽广道路。今年全国女职工数量已达九十九万人，比一九五○年增加了百分之七十四。她们正以无比的热情，积极劳动，开动脑筋找窍门，学习和创造了许多先进的工作方法。全国闻名的细纱女工郝建秀的工作法，现在已普及到纺纱部门，纺纱女工都以学习和掌握郝建秀工作法为光荣。根据去年的统计，全国职工中涌现出的劳动模范就有八万六千五百多人，其中女劳动模范约占百分之八点九。
    在国营企业中有许多女工被提拔为领导干部，仅东北、华东两区，从解放以来，已提拔为企业管理干部（车间主任、科长、厂长等）及工会领导工作者有六千四百余人。男女同工同酬制度，在国营企业中已普遍实行，工资数额正在逐年增加。有一百个职工以上的企业中，从一九五一年起就已实行了劳动保险，女工的特殊困难得到了特别的照顾。
    在四亿二千多万农业人口地区，已完成了土地改革，农妇们分得了一份土地，成为土地的主人。翻身的男女农民，以无比欢乐的心情，在自己的土地上劳作着；在绝大部分农村里已经有百分之六十以上能劳动的妇女参加田间劳动，个别地区高达百分之九十。今年参加农业互助合作组织的妇女已达全体参加农业生产的妇女总额的百分之四十到六十。其中出现了不少优秀的丰产模范。如全国闻名的冷月英等七人，荣获了中央人民政府农业部的奖励。
    随着农村互助组和农业生产合作社的发展，又组织和发展了抱娃娃组、农忙托儿所，解除了一部分农村妇女带孩子的困难；并推行了新法接生和新法育儿的知识，改进了农村妇婴卫生工作；举办了识字班读报组，提高了妇女的文化水平。有很多妇女被提拔到领导工作岗位上，当了组长、社长（例如山西长治专区一一八个农业合作社中就有女的正副社长九十五人）。所以农业生产合作社的女社员们感动地说：“参加生产合作社，老少健康，人财两旺，既能发家致富，又能解放妇女，比单干好多啦。”此外并注意培养了妇女农业技术干部，使他们学习使用新式农具，在国营农场中已出现了女拖拉机手和女场长。
    在文化教育、劳动就业等方面，妇女都获得了和男子同等的权利。在全国正推行的速成识字运动中，有些学习班里，妇女的数量比男子还多；在高等教育中，自中央人民政府教育部扩大助学金的制度以后，就从根本上保证了男女都有同等入学的机会，不再受“男尊女卑”的限制。在劳动就业方面，根据中央人民政府政务院关于劳动就业问题的决定，对妇女予以特别的照顾。在国家机关中，女职员的数量正在逐年增加（中央人民政府各机关今年女职员占职员总数的百分之二十二，比一九四九年增加百分之四），并实行了同工同酬，产前产后实行休假，工薪照发。
    第二、婚姻自由的权利，得到了法律保障，民主和睦的家庭正在逐渐产生。从一九五○年五月一日公布了婚姻法以后，政务院又公布了检查执行婚姻法情况的指示，从法律上保障了人民婚姻自由权利。各级人民政府和各级人民团体在群众中进行了关于婚姻法的宣传教育，并检查了婚姻法执行的情况。在工作做得好的地区，包办买卖婚姻基本上已经消灭，妇女结婚、离婚和再嫁都有了自由，人们选择恋爱对象的标准是生产勤劳、思想进步；民主和睦的新家庭到处出现。例如安徽阜阳专区，今年一月到八月，全区自由结婚的有八千七百多人，寡妇改嫁的有三千多人，民主和睦的家庭有九万五千三百多家，自由恋爱的有二千四百多对，青年男女美满地解决了自己的婚姻问题，她们歌唱着：“土地改革翻了身，互助合作栽富根；自愿自主结了婚，妇女们活得像了人”。因而妇女们在政治、文化、生产各方面都显得积极和活跃。
    但大部分地区工作做得尚差，特别是直接负责执行和宣传婚姻法的旧司法人员与保有封建思想的男女干部，尚严重地阻碍着婚姻法的贯彻执行。清除这些人员的封建思想，是婚姻法普遍贯彻执行的关键。
    第三、重视了母亲和儿童的保护工作。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中，规定了保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康。在劳动保险条例上，对女工及工人家属在产前产后又作了特别保护的规定。女工及职工家属同样享受到生、老、病、死、伤、残的保护。人民政府有关部门，民主妇女联合会各级组织和中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会是本着这个方针在努力工作的。因此三年来，妇婴卫生儿童福利事业有了蓬勃的发展，而国家机关、国营企业及农村互助组、农业生产合作社所举办的托儿组织妇婴事业，为数最大发展最快。据三十个省、十三个市、二个行署区、一个民族自治区的统计，共有托儿组织（包括哺乳室、育儿园、托儿所、保育院、托儿站、农忙托儿组织等）六万五千五百余处，受托儿童四十五万七千余人，工厂的、机关的和农村的托儿组织均较前大大的增长和发展了。全国现有妇幼保健机构共二万一千余处，受过训练的保健员、接生员和已经改造的旧产婆共达十七万三千人，苏联无痛分娩法正在城市中成功地逐步推行着。由于这些工作，使儿童死亡率逐步下降，母亲和儿童的健康日益增进，同时又大大地鼓励了妇女的生产积极性。综观三年以来，我国妇女们所获得的平等权利和特殊的保护，妇女在国家的培养和爱护下所表现的伟大的力量，证明了人民民主制度的优越性。但新中国成立以来只有短短的三年，而旧中国遗留下来的数千年的重男轻女的封建残余思想，不是短时期内所能全部肃清的，因而男女平等政策，还需要长期的奋斗，不断地克服困难，破除阻碍，才能完全贯彻实现。为此，我们应向全体人民广泛深入地宣传男女平等的政策，反对重男轻女的封建残余思想，以便更好地发挥妇女的潜在力量，参加祖国的伟大建设工作。我们妇女必须积极响应中国共产党、中央人民政府的号召，并在它的领导下，更进一步地团结起来，组织起来，准备知识和技能，迎接即将开始的大规模的经济建设和文化建设事业，积极建设祖国，为国家工业化建立基础，为妇女彻底解放而奋斗。
    各级妇女联合会要更加密切地联系妇女群众，更好地为她们服务，关心劳动妇女的工作、生活与疾苦，着重开展妇婴卫生事业，大力贯彻婚姻法并支援她们的正义的斗争。为此要更好地运用妇女代表会议的形式，在现有的基础上培养更多的积极分子，更好地起其纽带作用，团结更广大的妇女群众，积极参加新中国的建设。
    我们深知，只有在和平的环境里，才能顺利地进行以上的工作，才能愉快地过着平等幸福的生活；因此，我们要以无比的热情，致力于和平事业，争取和平，保卫和平，制止侵略战争。让我们和全世界的，特别是亚洲和太平洋区域的一切爱好和平的人民与妇女，亲密地携起手来，团结一致，为保卫和平、制止战争进行不懈的努力。为了更幸福的明天，为了我们远大的理想，在毛主席领导下，踏着苏联人民和妇女走向彻底解放的道路，满怀信心，热情奋发地前进再前进，从胜利走向更大的胜利。    （新华社）
