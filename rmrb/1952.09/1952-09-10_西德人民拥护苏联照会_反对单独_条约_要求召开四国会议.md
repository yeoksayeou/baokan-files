Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: According to TASS, the Soviet government's note of August 23 to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany has been widely and enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life in West Germany.
　　The German Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization, headquartered in Düsseldorf, issued a declaration to the West German working class, stating that implementing the Soviet proposal to convene a Four-Power conference to discuss and resolve the German question "would end the unfortunate division of our motherland and save the German people and the people of the world from the horrors of another war." The declaration called on "all workers to unite in their workplaces and trade unions, regardless of party affiliation or belief, to take concerted action against the Bonn separate 'treaty.' ... All German people should strive to support the peaceful unification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty, and actively participate in popular votes."
　　The West German "Association for Promoting Mutual Understanding Among the German People and Concluding a Just Peace Treaty" has issued an appeal to all members of the Bonn parliament, urging them to hold all-German elections. The appeal was signed by Dr. Wirth, former Chancellor of the German Reich, Mrs. Karl-Dorf-Oheim, former member of the German Reichstag, Fleischmann, second chairman of the Munich Christian Social Union, and Dr. Mars, a famous lawyer in Düsseldorf. The appeal expressed support for the recent Soviet government note and endorsed the Soviet proposal to hold a Four-Power conference no later than October. The appeal condemned the so-called "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Agreement," pointing out that "this path will lead to war and the destruction of our people." "'The General Treaty' makes it impossible to achieve a peaceful solution to the German question. Therefore, the second reading of 'The General Treaty' should no longer be held in parliament, and ratification of 'The General Treaty' must be prevented." The appeal called on the members of the Bonn parliament to immediately cooperate with the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to prepare for free all-German elections, as stipulated in the Soviet proposal.
　　Workers and peasants in West Germany have also written letters to newspapers, expressing their opposition to the "General Treaty." Karl Lubke, a metal worker from Hamburg, wrote: "I believe that only by overthrowing the Adenauer government can the struggle for the conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of German unity be carried out successfully. Only then can the German people get rid of the shameful, war-like 'General Treaty' and be able to concentrate all their efforts on building a democratic, peace-loving Germany." A letter from West German farmers said: "Only by rebuilding the unity of Germany and concluding a peace treaty can we farmers recover our homes confiscated by the Americans." Dr. Zorgen, a doctor from Essen, said in a letter: "We should make the occupying forces, who only bring disaster to West Germany, withdraw. What German would disagree with this?"

    西德人民拥护苏联照会
    反对单独“条约”要求召开四国会议
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社讯：苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会，已在西德得到各阶层人民广泛而热烈的拥护。
    总部设在杜塞尔多夫的德国工人反对重新军国主义化委员会向西德工人阶级发表宣言，指出，实行苏联所提出的召开四国会议讨论解决德国问题的建议，“就会终止我们祖国的不幸的分裂，把德国人民和全世界人民从另一次战争的恐怖中拯救出来。”宣言号召，“一切工人在他们工作的地方和工会中团结起来，不分党派关系和信仰，采取一致行动，反对波恩单独‘条约’。……全体德国人民为拥护德国的和平统一与缔结和约而努力，并积极参加人民投票。”
    西德“促进德国人民互相了解与缔结公正和约协会”已向波恩议会的全体议员发出呼吁，敦促举行全德选举。在呼吁书上署名的有：前德意志帝国总理维尔特博士、前德意志帝国议会议员卡尔道夫—欧亥姆夫人、慕尼黑基督教社会联盟第二主席夫莱什曼和杜塞尔多夫名律师马尔斯博士。呼吁书表示支持苏联政府最近的照会，并表示拥护苏联所提出的至迟在十月间举行四国会议的建议。呼吁书痛斥所谓“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团协定”，指出“这一条路将招致战争和我国人民的灭亡。”“‘一般性条约’使德国问题无法获得和平解决，因此，‘一般性条约’不应再在议会中举行二读了，必须阻止批准‘一般性条约’。”呼吁书号召波恩议会的议员们立刻与德意志民主共和国人民议会共同进行筹备，以便如苏联的建议中所规定的，举行全德自由选举。
    西德的工人、农民也纷纷写信给报纸，表示他们反对“一般性条约”的意志。汉堡金属工人卡尔·卢布克写道：“我认为只有推翻阿登纳政府才可以顺利地进行为缔结和约与恢复德国统一而进行的斗争。到那时，德国人民才能摆脱可耻的、战争性的‘一般性条约’，才能够集中一切力量来建设一个民主的、爱好和平的德国。”西德农民们的一封来信说：“只有重建德国的统一和缔结和约，才能够使我们农民们恢复我们被美国人没收的家园。”埃森的一位医生佐尔根在信中说：“我们应该使只把灾难带给西德的占领军撤出去，有什么德国人对这一点会不同意呢？”
