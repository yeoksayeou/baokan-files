Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 4th: The prisoner of war massacre incidents that occurred in U.S. prisoner of war camps in August have made the world see more clearly the heinous face of the U.S. side blatantly violating the Geneva Convention.

According to the U.S. side's own admission, on August 30th, sixteen prisoners of war were injured for refusing to engage in heavy labor for the U.S. side. On August 24th, a prisoner of war was killed by falling rocks in the Masan prisoner of war camp while engaged in dangerous work. The U.S. side's use of weapons to force prisoners of war to engage in dangerous labor or labor that harms their health is a serious violation of the Geneva Convention. Article 52 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war may not be employed on labour which is unhealthy or dangerous, unless they be volunteers." The U.S. side's forcing prisoners of war to do hard labor in its prisoner of war camps, causing many prisoners of war to die of fatigue and hunger, has already been confirmed by our captured personnel who were forced by the U.S. side to act as special agents and parachuted into our rear. Until now, the U.S. side has never been held responsible for accounting to our side for exactly how many prisoners of war have died unnatural deaths in this way. The American aggressors are so inhumanely forcing prisoners of war to engage in heavy and dangerous labor that violates the Geneva Convention in order to abuse and obliterate the lives of tens of thousands of exhausted prisoners of war.

In order to create a pretext for massacring prisoners of war, the U.S. side is now repeatedly claiming that many prisoners of war were beaten to death or injured because they were "singing." Prisoners of war being massacred for singing is unprecedented. All international laws and customs recognize that prisoners of war have the right to engage in cultural and recreational activities in prisoner of war camps. Article 38 of the Geneva Convention clearly stipulates: "The Detaining Power shall encourage intellectual, educational, recreational and sports pursuits, and shall take measures necessary ensure the practice thereof by providing suitable premises and equipment." In June, when the U.S. side used tanks and bayonets to forcibly disperse prisoners of war, the U.S. prisoner of war camp authorities even pretended to be complying with the Geneva Convention, hypocritically saying that they would set up "recreational facilities" in the camp, including "stages for dramas, concerts, dances, and singing performances." They obviously hoped that the prisoners of war would sing the "refuse repatriation" song to the rhythm of their bayonets. When their hopes were dashed, they decided to make the prisoners of war "live under strict disciplinary measures" and to use singing as the best pretext for carrying out massacres. The U.S. side does not even respect the prisoners of war's interest and right to sing in words, so what face does it have to clamor for so-called "respect for the individual rights of prisoners of war"?

In addition to the so-called "prisoners of war singing," the U.S. side also fabricated pretexts for massacring prisoners of war such as "prisoners of war fighting each other" and "prisoners of war escaping." Even according to the "charges" leveled by the U.S. side, the Geneva Convention does not give the U.S. side the right to arbitrarily use bayonets, rifles, grenades, or even tanks to massacre prisoners of war. Article 42 of the Convention stipulates: "The use of weapons against prisoners of war, especially against those escaping or attempting to escape, shall constitute an extreme measure, which shall always be preceded by warnings appropriate to the circumstances." Article 82 of the Convention stipulates: "If the Detaining Power enacts laws, regulations, or orders declaring that acts committed by prisoners of war are punishable, whereas the same acts would not be punishable if performed by members of the Detaining Power's own forces, such acts shall entail disciplinary punishment only." Article 89 stipulates that disciplinary punishments must never be inhuman, brutal, or harmful to the health of prisoners of war. In the U.S. military, is "singing" or "fighting each other" punishable by execution? Should one be beaten to death or injured with bayonets, rifles, or grenades? The American aggressors are now openly using such pretexts to massacre prisoners of war, which shows the extent to which they have disregarded the Geneva Convention!

In fact, all these pretexts are used to conceal a more serious crime: illegally detaining prisoners of war. U.S. prisoner of war camp spokesman Hall admitted on August 27th that when the U.S. side "dispersed" our captured personnel "to new enclosures and camps" in June, there were still "about 146,000" of our captured personnel. If we add the 27,000 people who were unilaterally handed over to the Syngman Rhee gang by the U.S. side as "civilians," then the total number of our captured personnel in the hands of the U.S. side would be exactly the number that the U.S. side had repeatedly admitted but later denied—173,000 people. However, Harrison openly claimed on August 19th that he did not even have the approximately 116,000 prisoners of war, including 20,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, whom the Korean and Chinese sides requested to be repatriated. The contradictory statements of Harrison and Hall reveal the sinister facts hidden behind shameless pretexts such as "prisoners of war singing," which is that, regardless of the angry protests of the people of the world, the American aggressors are still carrying out the evil act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The number of prisoners of war in U.S. prisoner of war camps is rapidly decreasing. Under the terrorist rule of U.S. special agents, large numbers of prisoners of war who firmly demand repatriation to their motherland are being massacred, and more prisoners of war are being sent to secret places unknown to anyone to suffer unimaginable torture. The series of massacre incidents that have occurred in U.S. prisoner of war camps are obviously the result of the U.S. side's secret conspiracy to detain prisoners of war meeting with resolute resistance from the prisoners of war. The American aggressors' barbaric and cowardly crime of violating the Geneva Convention gives the Korean and Chinese sides more than enough right and reason to demand that the U.S. side immediately account for the whereabouts of all prisoners of war, and more than enough reason to demand that the U.S. side repatriate all the prisoners of war they hold in accordance with Articles 51 and 52 of the agreed draft armistice agreement.

    美方在八月份一连串的屠杀战俘事件
    暴露美方公开破坏日内瓦公约的凶恶面目
    【新华社开城四日电】八月份发生在美方战俘营中的屠杀战俘事件，使全世界更清楚地看到了美方明目张胆地破坏日内瓦公约的凶恶面目。
    据美方自己承认，八月三十日，十六名战俘因为拒绝替美方从事苦重的劳动而被打伤。八月二十四日，一名战俘在马山战俘营因从事危险的工作而被落岩打死。美方这样用武器强迫战俘从事危险的或损害战俘健康的劳动，是严重地破坏日内瓦公约的罪行。日内瓦公约第五十二条规定：“战俘除自愿者外，不得使其从事有害健康或危险性之劳动。”美方在其战俘营中强迫战俘做苦工，以致许多战俘疲劳饥困而死，这已经由被美方强迫充当特务而空降到我方后方来的我方被俘人员证实了。一直到现在为止，美方从来没有向我方负责交代过究竟有多少这样死于非命的战俘。美国侵略者就是这样惨无人道地强迫战俘从事违反日内瓦公约的苦重和危险性的劳动，来虐害和磨灭成千成万筋疲力尽的战俘的生命。
    为了制造屠杀战俘的藉口，美方现在一再声称许多战俘之所以被打死打伤，是因为他们“唱歌”。战俘因为唱歌而被屠杀，这是史无前例的。一切国际公法和惯例都承认，战俘有在战俘营中进行文化娱乐活动的权利。日内瓦公约第三十八条就明白规定：“拘留国应在尊重战俘个人兴趣之条件下，鼓励战俘之文化、教育及娱乐、运动与游戏活动，并应采取必要措施，供给适当之场所及必需之设备，以保证其实行。”在六月间美方用坦克和刺刀强迫分散战俘的时候，美方俘虏营当局还曾经装出一副遵守日内瓦公约的面孔，假惺惺地说要在营场里设置包括“供演剧、音乐会、跳舞会和歌唱会的舞台”在内的“娱乐设备”。他们显然希望战俘能够依着他们刺刀的节拍而唱“拒绝遣返”之歌。当他们的希望落空了的时候，他们就决心使战俘“在严厉的惩戒措施下生活”，并且把唱歌也作为进行屠杀的最好藉口了。美方连在口头上对战俘的唱歌的兴趣和权利都不加尊重，还有什么脸皮叫嚷所谓“尊重战俘个人权利”呢？
    除了所谓“战俘唱歌”之外，美方还制造了所谓“战俘互殴”，“战俘逃亡”等等屠杀战俘的藉口。即使按照美方所加的“罪名”，日内瓦公约也并没有赋予美方任意用刺刀、步枪、手榴弹以至于坦克屠杀战俘的权利。公约第四十二条规定：“对战俘，尤其对脱逃或企图脱逃之战俘，使用武器，应属最后之手段，并应每次先予以适合于当时情况之警告。”公约第八十二条规定：“若拘留国任何法律、规则、或命令规定战俘所犯之行为应受处罚，而同样行为如为拘留国武装部队人员所犯则不受处罚，则该项行为应仅受纪律性的处罚。”八十九条规定纪律性处罚绝对不得非人道、残暴，或危害战俘健康。试问在美国军队中，难道“唱歌”、“互殴”就有枪毙之罪吗？就得被用刺刀、步枪、手榴弹打死打伤吗？美国侵略者现在公然用这种藉口来屠杀战俘，这说明他们蔑视日内瓦公约已经到了什么程度！
    事实上，所有这些藉口都是用来遮掩一个更严重的秘密扣留战俘的罪行的。美国战俘营发言人霍尔在八月二十七日还承认，在六月间美方将我方被俘人员“分散到新的围场与营场时”，我方被俘人员还有“十四万六千人左右”。如果加上被美方列为“平民”片面移交给了李承晚匪帮的二万七千人，那末在美方手中的我方被俘人员的总数，恰将是美方所曾经一再承认而后来又抵赖的数字——十七万三千人。而哈利逊却在八月十九日公开声称他连朝中方面要求遣返的包括两万名中国人民志愿军战俘在内的十一万六千名左右的战俘都没有。哈利逊和霍尔这种互相矛盾的说法，透露了隐藏在“战俘唱歌”之类的无耻藉口后面的阴森事实，这就是：不顾全世界人民的愤怒抗议，美国侵略者仍在进行强迫扣留战俘的罪恶勾当。美方战俘营中的战俘数目正在急剧减少。在美方特务分子的恐怖统治下，坚决要求遣返祖国的大批战俘正在被屠杀，而更多的战俘则正在被送到无人知道的秘密地方去受难以想像的折磨。美方战俘营中所发生的一连串屠杀事件，显然是美方这种秘密扣留战俘的阴谋遭到战俘坚决抗拒的结果。美国侵略者这种野蛮卑怯的破坏日内瓦公约的罪行，使朝中方面更有充分的权利和理由，要求美方立即交代所有战俘的下落，而且更有充分的理由，要求美方按照已获协议的停战协定草案第五十一款和五十二款遣返他们所收容的全部战俘。
