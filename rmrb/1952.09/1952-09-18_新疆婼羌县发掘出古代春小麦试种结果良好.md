    Ancient Spring Wheat Discovered in Ruoqiang County, Xinjiang, Successfully Trial-Planted
    Last winter, Uyghur farmers in Ruoqiang County, Xinjiang Province, discovered ancient spring wheat in ruins submerged by shifting sands. This year, local Uyghur farmers trialed the wheat with the following results: germination was very uniform, the plants grew up to four and a half feet tall, the stems were thick and strong, the ears of wheat were tetragonal prismatic in shape, without awns, and the glumes were extremely long, mostly around half an inch. The grains were as large as small soybeans with very deep ventral grooves. This ancient spring wheat variety is now extinct in Xinjiang. According to elderly Uyghur farmers in Ruoqiang, they had never seen this type of wheat before.

    Ruoqiang County is located on the southeastern edge of the Taklamakan Desert in southern Xinjiang Province, precisely on the "Yangguan Road," an ancient route from the interior through the Yumen Pass to the frontier. It was an important city for ancient overland transportation from China to India and Europe. Later, due to the southward movement of the desert, transportation between Ruoqiang and the interior was blocked, and many fields, houses, and historical sites were submerged by shifting sands. To this day, local Uyghur farmers often dig up ruins, utensils, and "mummies" from underground. Furthermore, the dry climate and year-round lack of rain have allowed the wheat, a gramineous plant rich in starch and not easily decayed, to be preserved intact underground for a long time.

    The Northwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry has entrusted the Northwest Agricultural College's Agricultural Experiment Station to conduct "winter planting" trials with the ancient spring wheat specimens excavated from Ruoqiang County this autumn, in order to observe and study the characteristics of this variety.

### 新疆婼羌县发掘出古代春小麦试种结果良好

    新疆婼羌县发掘出古代春小麦试种结果良好
    新疆省婼羌县维吾尔族农民，去年冬天在被流砂淹没的废墟中发掘出古代春小麦，经当地维吾尔族农民今年试种的结果：发芽很整齐，植株高达四尺五寸，茎干粗壮，麦穗为四棱柱状，无芒，颖壳极长，多在半寸左右，麦粒大如小黄豆，腹沟很深。这种古代春小麦品种目前在新疆已经绝迹，据婼羌维吾尔族老农民谈：他们也从未见过这种小麦。
    婼羌县位于新疆省南部塔克拉玛干大沙漠的东南边缘，恰是我国古代由内地西出玉门关到边疆的“阳关道”上，为我国古代通往印度、欧洲陆上交通的重要城市。后因沙漠南迁，阻隔了婼羌和内地的交通，很多田园房舍和古迹都被流砂淹没，至今当地维吾尔族农民常常在地下挖出废墟、器皿和“木乃伊”。又由于该地气候干燥，终年不雨，使不易腐烂且含淀粉较多的禾本科植物的小麦，能完整无损的久藏地下。
    现在，西北军政委员会农林部已经把婼羌县发掘出来的古代春小麦标本，委托西北农学院农业试验场在今秋试行“冬种”，以观察和研究该品种的特性。
