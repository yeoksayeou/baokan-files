    Winning Peace in the Asian and Pacific Region
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

    Saving peace has an urgent and practical significance in the current tense international situation. The people of Asia and the Pacific region have long suffered from the scourge of the Japanese militarist war of aggression. Many countries have not yet recovered. The United States government, representing the interests of the Wall Street financial groups, is pursuing its arrogant policy of world aggression. Disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people and the people of the world, it insists on reviving Japanese militarism. This places a new threat of war on the heads of hundreds of millions of good people in Asian and Pacific countries. How to remove the new threat of war is a realistic question that must be answered immediately and acted upon. The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, which has been warmly supported and prepared by the broad masses of people in various countries, is about to be held in Beijing. This is a firm answer from the people of Asian and Pacific countries in unified action against the new threat of war.

    As everyone knows, it is only a small group of warmongers who control the foreign policy of the United States government. Since the end of World War II, they have attempted to replace Japanese militarism in enslaving the people of Asia and the Pacific region, constantly carrying out their aggressive plots and war adventures. They instigated their running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's traitorous government to launch a civil war, attack the Chinese people, forcibly occupy China's territory of Taiwan, and openly carry out a war of aggression against Korea, delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice talks, and using bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese and Korean people. They also greatly expanded military bases in Asia and the Pacific, forcibly concluding a series of aggressive agreements, endangering the independence and autonomy of Asian and Pacific countries, and interfering in the independence and liberation movements of the people of Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines. More seriously, they openly violated the Potsdam Proclamation and imposed a unilateral "peace treaty with Japan," "U.S.-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty," and "Administrative Agreement" on the Japanese people, reviving Japanese militarist forces and turning Japan into its base of aggression in the East. In addition, they are frantically engaged in war propaganda, advocating hostility towards the peaceful people of China and the Soviet Union; implementing embargoes and blockades to prevent trade and cultural exchanges between peoples of various countries. These facts fully prove that the American warmongers are frantically dragging the people of Asian and Pacific countries into the abyss of war disaster, step by step.

    Peace is the common aspiration of mankind. The broad masses of people all demand peace and oppose war. History teaches people that war must be stopped, and peace cannot be waited for. The Chinese people have a deeper understanding of this from their long-term efforts to strive for peace.

    The Chinese people have successively, through arduous struggle, smashed Japanese aggression, overthrown the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's traitorous regime used by the United States to enslave the Chinese people, completely liberated themselves, and established the People's Republic of China. The principles of the People's Republic of China's foreign policy are to safeguard the independence, freedom, and integrity of its territory and sovereignty, to uphold lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and to oppose the imperialist policy of aggression and war. The Chinese people have concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with the great friendly country, the Soviet Union. The Chinese people, for the purpose of saving their neighbors and defending themselves, organized the Chinese People's Volunteers to go abroad to fight, assisting the Korean people in resisting aggression, which has made the aggressors suffer heavy losses, thereby effectively defending peace in the Far East and the world. More than 75 percent of the Chinese people have signed the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, clearly expressing their firm will to oppose aggression and defend peace. In the past three years, the Chinese people have also made unprecedented achievements in national construction, greatly strengthening their strength to defend peace. These important facts demonstrate the great contribution of the Chinese people in opposing aggression and defending peace through practical actions, and also show that the good will to demand peace must be transformed into strength and action in order to consolidate peace.

    The war provocations and adventures of the American warmongers, under the obstruction and prevention of the peace camp with the Soviet Union and China as the mainstays, have not succeeded step by step, but they do not know how to retreat in the face of difficulty, but instead clamor more frantically for war and intensify their war preparation conspiracy activities. This is certainly due to their greed and bellicosity reaching a degree of fanaticism, the so-called sunset and exhaustion, going against the tide of history; but more importantly, it is also due to the fact that the latent strength of the broad masses of people in striving for peace has not been fully brought into play, and some well-intentioned people are still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards defending peace because they are deceived by the lies of the warmongers. In fact, if people fall into the trap of the warmongers' lies, they will eventually incur endless disasters by condoning war conspiracies. Therefore, well-intentioned and upright people must never believe that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan, attack on Korea, and threat to China's borders are for defense; nor can they believe that the U.S. has the right to defend U.S. security in Korean territory and on China's borders 5,000 miles away; and even less can they believe that the U.S., which indiscriminately bombs peaceful cities and towns and even uses bacteriological weapons to massacre human beings, refuses to conclude peace treaties, and is hostile to the peace movement, is pursuing a policy of peace. On the contrary, these evil deeds of the American warmongers are absolutely intolerable to every kind and upright person, and they should take active action to stop their crimes and save peace. It must be understood that saving peace is saving oneself, saving one's children and family, and saving humanity and civilization. Saving peace is the common cause of all peace-loving people. If all peace-loving people unite and fully exert the latent strength of the broad masses of people, and take on the responsibility of saving peace, then only a small group of warmongers will be unable to make waves, the threat of war can be repelled, and peace can be ensured.

    We warmly welcome the arrival of peace fighters representing the people of all countries. The common will of the broad masses of people in the Asian and Pacific region will undoubtedly be transformed into strong strength and action through their consultations to save peace. We will soon see the magnificent lineup of the international united front for peace in the peace conference, with representatives of the people of more than 30 countries, united in the same noble aspiration, regardless of differences in political views, religious beliefs, nationalities, and occupations. This will further expand the ranks of the peace movement. We believe that through the discussion of the four items on the agenda, the peace conference will achieve effective programs to consolidate peace and security in the Asian and Pacific region, guide the peace movement to a new climax, and give a more serious blow to the aggression and war policies of the warmongers, so that peace in the Asian and Pacific region will be effectively guaranteed.

    We Chinese people have always loved peace and have a long history of fighting for peace. Today, we are an important force in defending peace in the Asian and Pacific region. We Chinese people are willing to support the proceedings of the conference with all our strength and wish the conference complete success. We are convinced that the forces of peace will grow stronger and stronger through the success of the peace conference. Peace will surely prevail!

    争取和平在亚洲及太平洋区域的胜利
    中国国民党革命委员会主席　李济深
    拯救和平，在目前紧张的国际局势下，具有迫切的实际的意义。亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，曾经长期遭受日本军国主义侵略战争灾害，至今尚有许多国家元气未复，而代表华尔街财阀集团利益的美国政府，则推行其狂妄的世界侵略政策，不顾日本人民和世界人民的反对，硬要将日本军国主义重新复活起来。这就使新的战争威胁，严重地压在亿万善良的亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的头上。如何解除新的战争威胁，已是摆在每个人的面前，必须立即提出答案并且立即采取行动的现实问题了。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，经过各国广大人民热烈的支持与筹备，即将在北京召开，这就是亚洲及太平洋各国人民以一致行动，对新的战争威胁所作的坚强回答。
    尽人皆知：控制着美国政府对外政策的，不过是一小撮战争贩子们，它们从第二次世界大战末期起，即企图代替日本军国主义奴役亚洲和太平洋区域人民，不断进行其侵略阴谋与战争冒险。它们曾嗾令其走狗蒋介石匪帮卖国政府发动内战，进攻中国人民，强占我国领土台湾，公然进行侵略朝鲜的战争，拖延、破坏朝鲜停战谈判，使用细菌武器残杀中、朝人民。它们又在亚洲及太平洋各地大事扩张军事基地，强迫缔结一连串侵略性协定，危害亚洲及太平洋各国的独立自主，干涉越南、马来亚、菲律宾人民独立解放运动。更严重的是它们公然破坏波茨坦公告，以片面“对日和约”、“美日双边安全条约”、“行政协定”强加于日本人民，复活日本军国主义势力，要把日本变为它在东方的侵略基地。此外它们复疯狂进行战争宣传，鼓吹敌视中、苏两国和平人民；施行禁运、封锁，阻止各国人民贸易来往和文化交流。这些事实，完全证明美国战争贩子们正在一步紧似一步，疯狂地将亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，拖向战争灾难的深渊去。
    和平是人类的共同愿望。广大的人民莫不要求和平而反对战争。而历史复教训着人们，战争必须制止，和平不能坐待。中国人民从长期为争取和平而努力的过程中，对这点体会得更为深切。
    中国人民曾先后以艰苦斗争，粉碎日本侵略，推翻美国藉以奴役中国人民的蒋介石匪帮卖国政权，完全解放了自己，成立了中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国外交政策的原则，为保障本国独立、自由和领土主权的完整，拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。中国人民已和伟大的友邦苏联缔结中苏友好同盟互助条约。中国人民复为救邻自卫，组织人民志愿军出国作战，援助朝鲜人民抵抗侵略，已使侵略者碰得头破血流，因而有效地保卫着远东和世界的和平。中国人民已有百分之七十五以上签名于要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上，明确表示反对侵略保卫和平的坚定意志。三年来中国人民更在国家建设方面，获得空前成就，大大加强保卫和平的力量。这些重要事实，说明中国人民以实际行动反对侵略保卫和平的重大贡献，也说明要求和平的善良意志，必须化为力量，化为行动，始能巩固和平。
    美国战争贩子们的战争挑拨和冒险，在以苏联、中国为主干的和平阵营阻遏制止之下，并未步步得逞，但它们并不知难而退，反而更疯狂地叫嚣战争，益发加紧备战阴谋活动。这固然由于它们利令智昏，好战已达昏狂程度，所谓日暮途穷，倒行逆施；但更重要的一面，还由于广大人民争取和平的潜藏力量犹未充分发挥，仍有一些善良的人们，因受战争贩子们谎言诓骗，而对于保卫和平采取袖手旁观的态度。其实人们若堕入战争贩子谎骗的罗网，结果将因纵容战争阴谋活动，招致无穷的灾难。所以善良正直的人们，决不能相信美国强占台湾、进攻朝鲜、威胁中国边境是为着防御；也决不能相信美国有权利在五千英里以外的朝鲜领土上和中国边境上来保卫美国安全；更不能相信滥炸和平城乡人民甚至使用细菌武器残杀人类、拒绝缔结和平公约、敌视保卫和平运动的美国是在推行和平政策。相反地，美国战争贩子们这些罪恶行为是每一个善良正直的人所绝对不能容忍，而应积极行动起来遏止它们的犯罪，拯救和平。须知拯救和平就是拯救自己，拯救自己的儿女和家庭，也就是拯救人类和文明。拯救和平是所有爱好和平人民的共同事业，如果爱好和平人民一致团结起来，充分发挥广大人民的潜藏力量，担当起拯救和平的责任，那么，只一小撮的战争贩子，就无从兴风作浪，战争威胁就可打退，和平就可确保。
    我们热诚地欢迎代表各国人民的和平战士的来临。亚洲及太平洋区域广大人民的共同意志，无疑地将通过他们的协商，化为坚强的力量与行动，来拯救和平。我们行将在和平会议中看到阵容壮阔的国际和平统一战线的阵容，三十多个国家人民的代表，大家不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族和职业的不同，在同一崇高愿望下，团结一致。这将使和平运动的阵容更进一步地扩大。我们相信和平会议通过四项议题的讨论，将获致巩固亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与安全的有效方案，指导和平运动走向新的高潮，给战争贩子们的侵略和战争政策以更严重的打击，从而使亚洲及太平洋区域的和平得到有效的保障。
    我们中国人民一向热爱和平，有着长期为争取和平而斗争的历史，今天更是保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平的重要力量。我们中国人民，愿以全力支持会议的进行，并预祝会议完全成功。我们确信：保卫和平力量将通过和平会议的成功而日益发展壮大。和平一定胜利！
