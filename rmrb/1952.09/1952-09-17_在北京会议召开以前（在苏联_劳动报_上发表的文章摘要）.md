    Before the Beijing Conference
    (Abstract of an Article Published in the Soviet "Trud")
    Kotov, Executive Secretary of the Soviet Peace Committee
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, to be held in Beijing in the second half of September, will strengthen the activities of peace forces in this region of the world and intensify their noble struggle against the heinous conspiracies of imperialism. The great significance of this conference is well known. Representatives of different races, religions, and political beliefs, representing more than 1.6 billion people from thirty-odd countries, will participate in the conference. The issues on the conference agenda are precisely those that are now stirring the hearts of all good people.
    The proposal to convene this conference has received enthusiastic support from all people in the Asian and Pacific regions. It is clear that the adoption of such measures aimed at further uniting all peace fighters is due to real needs. The danger of American expansion and aggression in Asia and Australia remains very serious. The imperialists have not abandoned their evil plans. American aggressors have been ravaging Korea for more than two years now. They have concluded a separate peace treaty with Japan, and they are intensifying the remilitarization of Japan and the establishment of a new Japanese aggressive army. The American aggressors are attempting to establish a Pacific group in the style of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to prepare a new military adventure against the peace-loving people of Asia and the Pacific region. Washington is striving to enslave all the countries of Latin America, forcing them to conclude enslaving military agreements.
    However, the people of all countries will no longer be deceived! No force can stem the surging tide of national liberation movements in Asia and Australia. The people of Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, and other countries are bravely defending their freedom and national independence, and they yearn for peace and a good life. The great example of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries illuminates their path to the future.
    These days, various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are actively preparing for the conference, and at the same time, the struggle for peace has seen a new upsurge. The ranks of peace fighters are growing day by day. Hundreds of thousands of people who were still outside the peace movement yesterday have raised their political awareness. Preparatory committees have been established in various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. These preparatory committees have extensively explained the purposes and tasks of the peace conference to people from all walks of life—workers, peasants, and intellectuals. At thousands of gatherings and conferences, representatives to the Beijing conference were elected.
    India is actively engaged in preparations for the conference. Despite the brutal persecution by the police, Japan carried out a "Peace Movement Month" nationwide to prepare for the conference. The Yoshida government's refusal to issue visas to representatives traveling to Beijing aroused widespread indignation in Japan. In other countries, preparations for the conference are also progressing smoothly. In Australia, Burma, Thailand, Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador, people from all walks of life and various groups have elected representatives.
    Progressive intellectuals in the Pacific region have carried out admirable activities to prepare for this conference, and they are bravely rising up to uphold peace and oppose the danger of a new war.
    The Soviet people firmly and unanimously demand peace in the Asian and Pacific regions together with all honest men and women. They are immersed in their great construction, and their vital interests require the defense and consolidation of peace. The Soviet people know how great a danger American aggression against Korea and China poses to international security. The Soviet working people resolutely rise up against the adventures of imperialism and strive for a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues.
    The conference will open soon. The hospitable Chinese people are preparing to welcome their guests in Beijing—the capital of the new People's China. Every representative will be able to personally see the great achievements of the Chinese people in transforming their motherland, and will be able to see their efforts to defend and consolidate peace in the Far East and the world.
    The holding of this Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference coincides with the world's active preparations for the great World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna at the end of this year. The Beijing conference is inextricably linked to this historic event in the great peace movement. This conference will once again powerfully promote the unity of all people's forces in Asia and the Pacific region, and jointly carry out a decisive struggle for peace and against the threat of war.

    在北京会议召开以前
    （在苏联“劳动报”上发表的文章摘要）
    苏联拥护和平委员会执行书记  科托夫
    九月下半月将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，将加强世界上这个地区的和平势力的活动，并加紧他们对于帝国主义的罪恶阴谋的崇高斗争，会议的这种重大意义是尽人皆知的。种族不同、宗教信仰不同和政治信仰不同的男女代表，将代表着三十几个国家的十六亿以上的人民参加会议。会议议程上的一些问题正是现在激动着所有善良的人们的问题。
    召开这次会议的主张得到了亚洲和太平洋区域全体人民的热烈拥护。很明显，采取这种旨在进一步团结所有和平战士的措施是由于现实的需要。美国在亚洲和澳洲扩张侵略的危险仍然是很严重的。帝国主义者并没有放弃他们的罪恶计划。美国侵略者蹂躏朝鲜，到现在已有两年多了。他们已经和日本缔结了单独和约，他们正加紧地使日本重新军国主义化并成立新的日本侵略军。美国侵略者企图按照北大西洋集团的式样成立一个太平洋集团，以便准备对亚洲和太平洋区域的爱好和平的人民发动一次新的军事冒险。华盛顿正力图奴役全部拉丁美洲各国，强迫和它们缔结奴役性的军事协定。
    但是，各国人民再也不会受骗了！没有力量能够挡住亚洲和澳洲民族解放运动的汹涌浪潮。朝鲜、越南、菲律宾、马来亚及其他国家的人民正在勇敢地保卫他们的自由和民族独立，他们渴望着和平与美好的生活。苏联、中国和人民民主国家的伟大榜样照亮了他们走向未来的道路。
    这些日子亚洲及太平洋区域各国正在积极进行会议的筹备工作，同时，争取和平的斗争有了新的高涨。和平战士的队伍一天比一天壮大。昨天还在和平运动之外的数十万人民已提高了政治觉悟。亚洲及太平洋区域各国都成立了筹备委员会。这些筹备委员会把和平会议的目的和任务向各阶层人民——工人、农民和知识分子——进行了广泛的解释工作。在数以千计的集会和大会上，选出了出席北京会议的代表。
    印度国内正在积极进行会议的筹备工作。尽管警察进行残酷的迫害，日本全国进行了“和平运动月”，以筹备这次会议。吉田政府拒发前往北京的代表们的签证一举在日本引起了普遍的愤慨。在其他国家，会议的筹备工作也很顺利。在澳大利亚、缅甸、泰国、危地马拉、哥伦比亚、墨西哥、智利、秘鲁和厄瓜多尔各国，各阶层人民和各团体都选出了代表。
    太平洋区域进步知识分子为了筹备这次会议进行了可敬佩的活动，他们正勇敢地起来拥护和平，反对新战争的危险。
    苏联人民坚决和全体正直的男女一致要求亚洲和太平洋区域的和平。他们埋头努力于他们伟大的建设，他们的切身利益要求保卫和巩固和平。苏联人民知道，美国对朝鲜和中国的侵略对国际安全造成了如何巨大的危险。苏联劳动人民坚决地起来反对帝国主义的冒险，争取和平解决一切相持不下的问题。
    没有多久会议就要开幕了。好客的中国人民正准备在北京——人民新中国的首都——欢迎他们的客人。每一个代表将能亲自看到中国人民改造他们祖国的巨大成就，将能看到他们保卫和巩固远东和全世界和平的努力。
    这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的举行，正值全世界正在积极筹备本年底在维也纳举行伟大的世界人民和平大会的时候。北京的会议是和伟大的和平运动中这一历史性事件不可分地联系着的。这一会议将再一次有力地促进亚洲和太平洋区域一切人民力量的团结，共同进行争取和平、反对战争威胁的决定性斗争。（新华社）
