    Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin on the 2nd, congratulating him on the seventh anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The telegram reads as follows:
    To Marshal Stalin:
    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, please accept my, the Chinese People's Liberation Army's, and the entire Chinese people's warm congratulations and heartfelt thanks to you, the Soviet armed forces, and the Soviet people.
    The Soviet Union gave tremendous assistance to the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Soviet army annihilated the main force of the Japanese army—the Kwantung Army—helping the Chinese people to achieve final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The fraternal assistance given by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people in the process of China's recovery and construction has enabled the Chinese people's strength to be rapidly consolidated and expanded.
    Now, as Japanese militarism is being revived and Japanese aggressive forces are rising again, the unbreakable friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful guarantee for jointly preventing Japan and any other country colluding with Japan in aggressive acts from re-aggression, and for safeguarding peace in the East and the world.
    Long live the unbreakable great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
    Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong
    September 2, 1952

    毛主席电斯大林大元帅贺抗日战争胜利七周年
    【新华社二日讯】我中央人民政府毛泽东主席于二日致电斯大林大元帅，祝贺抗日战争胜利七周年。电文如下：斯大林大元帅：
    在抗日战争胜利七周年的时候，请接受我及中国人民解放军和全中国人民向你和苏联武装部队、苏联人民的热烈的祝贺与衷心的感谢。
    苏联在抗日战争中给予中国人民的巨大援助，苏联军队歼灭日本军队的主力——关东军，帮助了中国人民在抗日战争中取得最后胜利。苏联在中国的恢复与建设过程中给予中国人民的兄弟般的帮助使中国人民的力量获得迅速的巩固与壮大。
    现在，当着日本军国主义正在复活，日本侵略势力又重新抬头的时候，中国与苏联的牢不可破的友好同盟是共同制止日本和其他在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略、保卫东方与世界和平的有力保证。
    中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的牢不可破的伟大友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席　毛泽东
    一九五二年九月二日
