    Resolving the Problem of Elementary School Graduates' Advancement to Higher Education with Revolutionary Spirit and Revolutionary Methods
    Recently, we have received many letters from elementary school graduates, parents, and other readers from various regions reflecting a growing problem: the increasing number of elementary school graduates, while the enrollment quotas for middle schools are far from sufficient to accommodate the demand. They unanimously request the People's Government to swiftly find a solution to this issue.
    The majority of the letters are from the East China region. Readers from Jingjiang, Nantong, Nanjing, the entire Ningbo Special District of Zhejiang (excluding Xinchang County), Dangshan in Anhui, and other places have all reflected this problem. Similar situations exist in the Central South region. For example, a reader from Kaiping County in Guangdong wrote that over five thousand people in the county applied for secondary schools this year, but the actual enrollment capacity of all secondary schools is only about one thousand five hundred students.
    We believe that the current inadequacy of middle school enrollment quotas to meet the demands of elementary school graduates is a widespread problem. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the progress and development of people's education. In old China, the reactionary ruling class fundamentally deprived the children of the broad masses of working people of the opportunity to study, and secondary schools were few in number and poor in quality. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government has first carried out the work of consolidation and improvement of secondary education, and has also made appropriate developments. However, the foundation of secondary education left to us by old China was too weak; and now that the national land reform has been basically completed, the national financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved, the people's living standards have improved day by day, and the number of elementary school graduates, especially the children of the working people, who want to continue their studies has increased dramatically, the current middle schools are far from being able to meet the demands of elementary school graduates.
    In order to develop the people's education and meet the needs of national construction, the People's Government has decided to greatly develop secondary schools in the future, especially ordinary secondary schools. When the National Conference on Primary and Secondary School Education Administration opened in August this year, Minister of Education Ma Xulun of the Central People's Government clearly pointed out that "In order to meet the needs of various national construction undertakings, ensure the source of students for universities and colleges, and increase the opportunities for elementary school graduates to pursue further education, the massive development of secondary schools, especially the development of ordinary secondary schools, is a key issue in educational construction in the next few years." In addition to making various decisions regarding the expansion of middle school enrollment this year, this conference also discussed the preparatory work for the massive development of secondary education in the future. In the future, the opportunities for elementary school graduates to enter higher education can be increased year by year with the development of secondary schools; however, due to the limitations of objective conditions such as teachers and school buildings, this problem must be solved step by step and in a planned manner.
    In order to solve the current temporary difficulties, the People's Government has taken the following two measures:
    First, vigorously promote the two-shift system (including night classes) in middle schools. In the future, secondary education needs to be greatly developed, and the lack of teachers and school buildings will be the main difficulties in the development. In order to overcome these difficulties, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, based on the principle of running schools with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, and after initially summarizing the experience of various regions in piloting the two-shift system in middle schools, has advocated vigorously promoting the two-shift system to increase the capacity of middle school students. However, some readers' letters reflect that they still suspect that the two-shift system is not a regular middle school, so they are unwilling to apply for it; or they have no choice but to enroll, but they still want to transfer schools if they have the opportunity. We believe that this view is incorrect. Whether a school is "regular" or not should depend on whether its teaching content meets the needs of national construction and reaches a certain standard. According to the experience of pilot programs in Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, and other places, this revolutionary method has been proven to be successful, and it has effectively solved the difficulty of insufficient school buildings, expanded the opportunities for elementary school graduates to enter higher education, and created favorable conditions for the massive development of secondary education. Therefore, we ask everyone to correct their understanding of the two-shift system in middle schools and attach importance to the promotion of the two-shift system in middle schools.
    Second, encourage students to apply for junior normal schools, junior technical schools, and various training courses, which is also an effective way to solve the problem of elementary school graduates' advancement to higher education. From many readers' letters, it can be seen that when they mention advancement to higher education, they are referring to entering middle school; they are unwilling to apply for normal schools, technical schools, and related training courses, etc., believing that they have no future. This view is also incorrect. National construction needs talents in many fields, and people's teachers, technicians, and general staff are all construction cadres needed by the country. Students should also respond to the call of the motherland and develop in all directions. Moreover, graduates of normal schools and technical schools can also continue their studies after a certain period of service. The school system of New China is that "all roads lead to university." Therefore, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, as long as everyone studies hard and works hard, no matter which direction they develop in, the future is infinitely bright.
    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of these two measures, so as to facilitate the solution of the problem of elementary school graduates' advancement to higher education, we hope that students will correctly understand the above situation, and we hope that education workers, parents, and the general public in various places will help students establish correct ideas about advancement to higher education.

### 用革命精神和革命办法解决小学毕业生升学问题

    用革命精神和革命办法解决小学毕业生升学问题
    最近我们收到各地很多小学毕业生、学生家长和其他读者来信反映：各地区小学毕业生日益增多，中学招生名额远不足以适应小学毕业生升学的要求。他们一致要求人民政府迅速设法解决这个问题。
    来信的读者以华东区的较多。如靖江、南通、南京、浙江宁波专区全区（新昌县除外）、安徽砀山等地读者都反映了这个问题。中南地区也有类似情况。如广东开平县读者来信反映：该县本届投考中等学校的有五千余人，但各中学实际仅能招收学生一千五百人。
    我们认为：目前中学招收名额不足以适应小学毕业生升学的要求，这是一个带有普遍性的问题。这是人民教育事业在进步和发展中的必然现象。在旧中国，反动统治阶级根本不让广大劳动人民的子女有求学的机会，而中等学校更是量少质差。中华人民共和国成立以来，中央人民政府对于中学教育，首先作了整顿与巩固的工作，并且也作了适当的发展。但是，旧中国所留给我们的中等教育的基础实在太微弱了；而现在全国土地改革已基本完成，国家财政经济状况已根本好转，人民生活日益改善，小学毕业生，尤其是劳动人民的子女，要求升学者剧增，因此目前的中学就远不能适应小学毕业生升学的要求了。
    为了发展人民教育事业和适应国家建设的需要，人民政府已决定今后大量发展中等学校，特别是普通中学。本年八月全国中小学教育行政会议开幕时，中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长已经明确地指出“为了适应国家各种建设事业的需要，保证高等学校学生的来源以及增加小学毕业生升学深造的机会，大量发展中等学校，特别是发展普通中学，是今后几年教育建设中的一个带关键性的问题。”这次会议除了对今年中学的扩大招生问题，作了各种决定；对于今后大量发展中学教育的准备工作，也作了讨论。今后小学毕业生的升学机会是可以随着中等学校的发展而逐年增加的；但是由于师资、校舍等客观条件的限制，这个问题必须有步骤、有计划地加以解决。
    为了解决目前暂时的困难，人民政府已经采取了下列两个办法：
    首先，大量推行中学二部制（包括夜间班）。今后中学教育需要大量发展，而师资与校舍的缺乏，又将是发展中的主要困难。为了克服这些困难，中央人民政府教育部根据以革命精神与革命办法办学的原则，并初步总结了各地区试行中学二部制的经验，提倡大力推广二部制，以增加中学学生的容量。但是某些读者的来信中反映出：目前他们还怀疑二部制是非正规的中学，因而不愿投考；或是不得已而入学了，但仍想有机会就转学。我们认为这种看法是不正确的。学校的“正规”与否，应该看它的教学内容是否适应国家建设的需要和达到一定的规格。根据北京、沈阳、哈尔滨等地试行的经验，已经证明了这一革命办法是成功的，并且已有效地解决了学校校舍不够的困难，扩大了小学毕业生升学的机会，给大量发展中学教育创造了有利条件。因此我们要求大家端正对中学二部制的认识，并重视中学二部制的推广。
    其次，鼓励学生投考初级师范、初级技术学校及各种训练班，这也是解决小学毕业生升学问题的有效办法。从很多读者来信中看出：他们一提到升学，就是指的升入中学；他们不愿投考师范学校、技术学校及有关的各种训练班等，认为没有前途。这种看法也是不正确的。国家建设正需要多方面的人才，人民教师、技术人员及一般工作人员，都是国家所需要的建设干部。同学们也应响应祖国的号召，向各方面发展。而且师范学校和技术学校毕业后，经过一定时期的服务，同样是可以升学的。新中国的学制是“条条大路通大学”的。因此，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，每个人只要努力学习，努力工作，无论向那方面发展都是无限光明的。
    为了使这两个办法顺利推行，以利于解决小学毕业生升学的问题，我们希望同学们正确了解以上情况，并希望各地教育工作者、学生家长及社会上一般人士帮助同学们树立正确的升学思想。
