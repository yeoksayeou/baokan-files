    Beijing Transportation Company and Coal Construction Branch Company
    Have Started to Solve Workers' Safety and Health Problems
    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" page on July 9th criticized the leading cadres of Beijing Transportation Company and Coal Construction Branch Company for neglecting the safety and health of loading and unloading workers, resulting in serious casualties. Both companies accepted the criticism and immediately took emergency measures to correct it. In the past month, the labor protection situation of workers has gradually improved, and work-related injuries have been greatly reduced.

    In order to effectively prevent the occurrence of casualties, the administrative side and the trade union organization of Beijing Transportation Company, with the participation of administrative cadres from the Coal Construction Branch Company, established a joint safety production office on July 16. The two companies also drew a group of cadres to form six working groups, which went to eight loading and unloading sites, including Xibianmen, Xizhimen, and Yongdingmen, to work. The working groups used various forms to widely carry out safety ideological education, criticized the erroneous thinking of some cadres who did not pay attention to worker safety and did not care about workers' well-being; and inspected the labor protection equipment and dormitory conditions of each freight yard and warehouse. In the past month, the transportation company has added protective clothing, rubber gloves, and other anti-toxic equipment. Of the 500 workers' dormitories built by the Transportation Company Trade Union, 186 have been completed. The Coal Construction Branch Company has purchased lighting equipment and loading and unloading tools for each freight yard. The Xizhimen freight yard has built sixteen workers' rest rooms, and the Yongdingmen freight yard has erected temporary sheds.

    The Transportation Company has established a systematic labor protection organization and has generally paid attention to the issue of labor protection education. The Transportation Company has established a labor department, and each office and transportation station has a labor protection officer responsible for labor protection and worker health and welfare. Various forms of safety handling research organizations have also been established in each office, transportation station, and transportation team to find ways to improve handling techniques. For example, the Xibianmen freight yard established a technical training class; the Qianmen Transportation Company office and the trade union established a safety production office; the Xizhimen freight yard adopted the form of large classes for safety education; and the Yongdingmen freight yard summarized and promoted the experience of the fourth loading and unloading team in achieving 100 days without accidents.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市运输公司和煤建分公司
    已着手解决工人安全卫生问题
    编辑同志：七月九日“读者来信专页”，对北京市运输公司和煤建分公司的领导干部忽视装卸工人的安全卫生，以致造成严重伤亡事故，提出了批评。两公司都接受了批评，立即采取了紧急措施进行纠正。一个月来，工人的劳动保护情况已逐渐好转，工伤事故大为减少。
    为了有效地防止伤亡事故的发生，北京市运输公司行政方面和工会组织，吸收煤建分公司行政干部参加，在七月十六日成立了安全生产联合办公室。两公司又抽调出一批干部，组织了六个工作组，分赴西便门、西直门、永定门等八个装卸现场工作。工作组用各种形式广泛地展开安全思想教育，批判了某些干部不重视工人安全、不关心工人疾苦的错误思想；并对各货场和仓库的劳动保护设备及宿舍情况进行检查。一个月来，运输公司已添置防护衣、胶皮手套等防毒用具。运输公司工会修建的五百间工人宿舍已盖好了一八六间。煤建分公司各货场都已添购了照明设备和装卸工具。西直门货场已修建了十六间工人休息室，永定门货场已搭好临时工棚。
    运输公司已经建立了系统的劳动保护的组织，对劳保教育问题也已普遍地重视了。运输公司成立了劳动科，各办事处及运输站设劳保干事，负责掌握劳动保护及工人卫生福利工作。各办事处、运输站及运输中队还成立了各种形式的安全搬运研究组织，设法改进搬运技术。如西便门货场成立了技术训练班；前门运输公司办事处与工会成立了安全生产办公室；西直门货场，采取上大课的形式进行安全教育；永定门货场总结和推广装卸四中队百天无事故的经验。
