    What to Pay Attention to When Carrying Out Mass Appraisal Campaigns
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued the "Notice on Launching the Autumn Crop Bumper Harvest Appraisal Campaign" and announced the "Provisional Measures for Rewarding Bumper Harvests in Agriculture, 1952." A large-scale bumper harvest appraisal campaign will soon be launched across the country around the autumn harvest, and bumper harvest models for this year will be rewarded based on the appraisal results.
    According to the spirit of these two documents and the experience of various places in conducting seasonal appraisals, the following issues should be noted when launching the autumn appraisal campaign.
    I. In the appraisal campaign, it is necessary to strengthen ideological and organizational leadership. Because the appraisal campaign is just beginning nationwide, many rural cadres and peasant masses do not fully understand the significance of this campaign. Some believe that conducting appraisals during the tense period of production will delay production, not knowing that appraisals can promote current production work. Some believe that appraisals are only for reporting awards, getting red flags, and electing models, without paying attention to summarizing production experience. Some are afraid of participating in the appraisal because their production results are not good, fearing that they will "lose face"; not knowing that participating in the appraisal can help them discover the reasons for poor production results, making it easier to get good harvests in the future. Some believe that the appraisal is "checking fields and determining production to prepare for the autumn grain tax," fearing that increasing the burden by appraising high-yield fields; not knowing that the same fields, if cultivated intensively, will yield higher outputs without increasing the burden. Leaders should address these ideological concerns, and conduct ideological and policy education in connection with the facts already existing in various places that are sufficient to break these ideological concerns.
    The appraisal campaign should have complete content. In the past, some places only compared bumper harvests and not patriotism, or only compared politics and not technology, which were all one-sided. Cadres leading the appraisal campaign should grasp this and combine the two aspects well. In the past, some places had too much appraisal content, and leading cadres should appropriately concentrate it. In addition, leading organs in various places must also carefully check to prevent the phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements, in order to maintain the seriousness of the appraisal and rewards. The "Provisional Measures for Rewarding Bumper Harvests" stipulate that "rewards can only be given after the large administrative region and the provincial people's government have reviewed and confirmed them" and that "when crops are harvested, personnel must be sent to conduct on-site investigations of bumper harvest achievements, accurately measure the area and yield, and make summaries," which are very necessary provisions.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the appraisal campaign, various localities should, according to necessary and possible conditions, establish bumper harvest appraisal committees at all levels, or rely on the strength of the production and drought prevention offices to lead the appraisal work. Some county production and drought prevention offices are already empty, and some county and district production leading organs have suppressed the instructions issued by higher authorities regarding autumn production and appraisal work, neither arranging nor communicating them. This is very wrong. At this tense juncture of autumn production, various localities should immediately find ways to improve the organizations leading production.
    II. In the appraisal campaign, it is necessary to mobilize and rely on the masses, fully promote democracy, and conduct extensive and in-depth discussions. In this way, on the one hand, it can ensure that the appraisal is comprehensive, fair, and accurate, and prevent the false reporting of achievements, and on the other hand, it can expand the influence of appraisal and rewards among the masses. Some personnel who went to the countryside to lead the appraisal in the past, because they did not fully understand the significance of the appraisal, or did not trust the masses, or were afraid of delaying the production time of the masses, only measured and checked the fields through a few village cadres. This not only fails to achieve the purpose of the appraisal, but also causes more misunderstandings and concerns among the masses.
    III. In the appraisal, attention should be paid to comprehensive and large-area increase in production. In the past, when awarding prizes, emphasis was placed on rewarding those who planted a certain crop on a smaller area and obtained high yields, which played a great role in breaking conservative thinking and dispelling concerns about increasing production. In the future, appropriate rewards should still be given to those who obtain high yields and create new records of bumper harvests. However, it is not enough to do this alone, and it is not possible to universally increase the yield per unit area. This spring, the leadership in many places had a bias towards only valuing small-area bumper harvests and neglecting universal increase in production; until recently, when some mutual aid teams formulated next year's wheat bumper harvest plans, they only made plans for high-yield land and did not make plans for comprehensive increase in production. Therefore, in this autumn's appraisal campaign, comprehensive bumper harvests over large areas should be given top priority.
    For units and individuals who create high yields, whether they can drive the masses to increase production should be used as one of the appraisal conditions. The "Provisional Measures for Rewarding Bumper Harvests" particularly emphasize "comprehensive increase in production" and point out that "award recipients must be those who love the motherland and maintain close ties with the masses." Various localities should grasp this principle well in the appraisal.
    IV. In the appraisal, it is necessary to carefully summarize bumper harvest experience. The appraisal campaign is a mass movement to summarize experience. If the appraisal campaign does not include these contents, it will inevitably become formalism. Past experience has shown that as long as the appraisal campaign includes these contents, the masses will voluntarily and enthusiastically participate. To promote the patriotic production increase movement, to stabilize existing bumper harvest achievements, and to universally increase the yield per unit area, summarizing and promoting advanced production experience is a decisive link. In the appraisal campaign, the masses will find out the reasons for bumper harvests and reduced production; the experience appraised in this way will definitely have a good effect in next year's production. The leadership can then summarize the different types of experience from various places based on scientific theory and promote them, which will have a greater effect.
    V. In the appraisal, it is necessary to check the implementation of production plans. If the appraisal deviates from the plans made by each unit and individual last winter and this spring and the plans announced during the challenge, it will obscure the significance of formulating production plans, which is extremely detrimental to carrying out production increase competition in the future. If the plan has not been completed, serious discussions should be conducted in the appraisal, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out to learn lessons from it. If the production increase plans of units that have challenged larger areas have not been completed, the relevant leading cadres should also conduct public and serious self-criticism to the masses based on the actual situation. In the past, the leading cadres in some places adopted an attitude of concealing and covering up the production results of labor models and model mutual aid teams who had not completed their plans, neither making necessary explanations to the masses nor conducting self-criticism. This attitude will hinder the development of the patriotic production increase movement and must be resolutely corrected.
    VI. In the appraisal, attention should be paid to checking the leadership style and summarizing the leadership methods. This year, many units and personnel leading agricultural production in various places have closely integrated with the masses and created many good methods for leading and promoting the production movement, which have greatly improved the local production increase movement. The "Provisional Measures for Rewarding Bumper Harvests" stipulate that "those who have made significant achievements in leading the patriotic production increase movement in the people's governments, people's organizations, and rural staff at all levels" should be rewarded, which is very necessary. The reward of these units and individuals should also be carried out on the basis of mass appraisal campaigns, and a summary of the production movement should be made through appraisal.
    VII. The appraisal campaign should be closely integrated with current work. First of all, through the appraisal campaign, promote the superiority of being organized, consolidate mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and attract individual farmers to participate in mutual aid teams. If it is found in the appraisal that the output of some mutual aid teams is not higher than the output of ordinary farmers in the area, then there must be problems with the mutual aid team itself, and the reasons must be found out in the appraisal and improved. Secondly, the appraisal should be combined with seed selection. After the appraisal of households, groups, villages, districts, and counties, the excellent varieties are selected level by level. At the same time, we must consciously encourage the production enthusiasm of farmers through appraisal, in order to promote autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, and do not separate these tasks from the appraisal.
    The bumper harvest appraisal campaign is the basis for correctly implementing bumper harvest rewards, the basis for systematically summarizing the production experience of the whole year, the basis for holding agricultural labor model representative conferences in various places this winter, and also the basis for more forcefully carrying out next year's patriotic production increase competition. Agricultural leading organs and all rural work cadres in various parts of the country should concentrate their efforts, lead the bumper harvest appraisal campaign well, and use the power of this mass movement to promote my country's agricultural production to a higher level.

### 开展群众性的评比运动要注意些什么

    开展群众性的评比运动要注意些什么
    中央人民政府农业部最近发出了“关于开展秋季作物丰产评比运动的通知”，公布了“一九五二年农业丰产奖励暂行办法”。全国各地即将在秋收前后开展一个大规模的丰产评比运动，并将在评比运动的基础上奖励今年的丰产模范。
    根据这两个文件的精神和各地进行季节性的评比的经验，在开展秋季评比运动时，应当注意以下几个问题。
    一、在评比运动中必须加强思想领导和组织领导。由于评比运动在全国范围内方在开始，许多农村干部和农民群众对于这个运动的意义还不完全了解。有的认为正在生产的紧张时期进行评比，将会耽误生产；而不知道评比正可以推动当前的生产工作。有的认为评比只是为了报奖、得红旗、选举模范，而不注意总结生产经验。有的因为自己的生产成绩不好，怕参加评比“丢人”；而不知道参加评比正可以使自己发现生产成绩不好的原因，便于以后得到好的收成。有的认为评比是“查田定产给秋征作准备”，怕评出丰产田来要增加负担；而不知道同样的田精耕细作得到较高的产量，是不增加负担的。领导方面应针对这些思想顾虑，联系各地已有的足以打破这些思想顾虑的事实，进行思想教育和政策教育。
    评比运动应有完整的内容。过去有的地方在评比中只比丰产、不比爱国，有的只比政治、不比技术，这都是片面的。领导评比运动的干部应当加以掌握，把两方面很好地结合起来。有的地方过去评比内容太多，领导干部应使之适当集中。此外，各地领导机关还必须认真检查，防止假报成绩的现象，以保持评比、奖励的严肃性。丰产奖励暂行办法中规定“由大行政区、省人民政府审核认为确实后，方能予以奖励”，“作物收获时，须派员实地调查丰产成绩，准确测定面积、产量，作出总结”，这样的规定是很必要的。
    为了加强评比运动的领导，各地应该根据必要与可能的条件，成立各级丰产评比委员会，或者依靠生产防旱办公室的力量，领导评比工作。有些县的生产防旱办公室已经空无一人，有些县、区的生产领导机关把上级发下的有关秋季生产和评比工作的指示压起来，既不布置也不传达。这都是很不应该的。在这秋季生产的紧张关头，各地应该立即设法健全领导生产的机构。
    二、在评比运动中必须发动群众和依靠群众，充分发扬民主，展开广泛深入的讨论。这样，一方面可以保证评比得全面、公平、确实，防止假报成绩，一方面可以扩大评比和奖励在群众中的影响。曾经有些下乡领导评比的人员，由于没有全面地了解评比的意义，或者不相信群众，或者害怕耽误群众的生产时间，而只是通过少数村干部，到地里丈量、查看，这样做不但不能达到评比的目的，反而引起群众更多的误解和顾虑。
    三、在评比中要注意全面的和大面积的增产。过去评奖时着重奖励了在较小面积上种植某一种作物获得高额产量的人，这对于打破保守思想、扫除增产顾虑起了很大的作用。今后对于获得高额产量和创造丰产新纪录的人，还要予以适当的奖励。但是，仅仅这样作是很不够的，是不能普遍提高单位面积产量的。今年春天，许多地方的领导方面发生了只重视小面积丰产而忽视普遍增产的偏向；直到最近，有些互助组制订下年度小麦丰产计划时，还是只订了丰产地的计划，而没有订全面增产的计划。因此，今秋在评比运动中，应当把大面积上的全面丰产提到首要的地位。
    对于创造高额产量的单位和个人，应把他们是不是能带动群众增产，作为评比的条件之一。丰产奖励办法中特别强调“全面增产”，并指出“受奖者必须是热爱祖国、密切联系群众者”。各地在评比中应很好地掌握这个原则。
    四、在评比中要认真总结丰产经验。评比运动就是群众性的总结经验的运动，评比运动如果不包括这些内容，就必然流于形式主义。过去的经验证明：评比运动只要包括了这些内容，群众就会自愿地热情地参加。要推进爱国增产运动，要稳定已有的丰产成绩，要普遍提高单位面积产量，总结和推广先进生产经验是决定性的环节。在评比运动中，群众是会把丰产和减产的原因找出来的；这样评比出来的经验，一定会在下年度的生产中发生良好的作用。领导方面再根据各地的不同类型的经验，依据科学理论加以总结，推广出去，就会发生更大的作用。
    五、在评比中要检查生产计划的执行情况。评比如果脱离了各单位和个人在去冬今春订立的计划和挑战时宣布的计划，就会使人们模糊了订立生产计划的意义，这对于今后开展增产竞赛运动是极为不利的。如果计划没有完成，就应当在评比中进行认真的讨论，展开批评和自我批评，从中吸取教训。如果那些向较大区域提出挑战的单位的增产计划没有完成，有关的领导干部也应当根据实际情况，对群众进行公开的严肃的自我批评。过去有些地方的领导干部对于没有完成计划的劳动模范、模范互助组的生产结果，采取掩饰遮盖的态度，既不向群众作必要的交代，也不进行自我批评。这种态度会妨碍爱国增产运动的发展，必须切实纠正。
    六、在评比中要注意检查领导作风，总结领导方法。今年各地许多领导农业生产的单位和工作人员，和群众紧密结合，创造了许多领导和推进生产运动的好方法，使当地的增产运动有了很大的成绩。丰产奖励办法规定对“各级人民政府、人民团体及农村工作人员领导爱国增产运动有显著成绩者”予以奖励，是很必要的。对这些单位和个人的奖励，同样地应该在群众性的评比运动的基础上来进行，并应通过评比，作出领导生产运动的总结。
    七、评比运动要和当前的工作密切结合。首先要通过评比运动，宣传组织起来的优越性，巩固互助合作组织，并吸引单干农民参加互助组。如果在评比中发现有的互助组的产量不比当地一般农民的产量高，那就必然是互助组本身有问题，就要在评比中找出原因来，加以改进。其次，评比要和选种相结合。经过户、组、村、区、县的评比，把优良品种逐级选出来。同时，还要有意识地通过评比鼓舞农民的生产积极性，以推动秋收、秋种、秋耕工作，不要把这些工作和评比割裂开来。
    丰产评比运动是正确实行丰产奖励的基础，是有系统地总结全年生产经验的基础，是各地今冬召开农业劳动模范代表会议的基础，也是更有力地开展下年度的爱国增产竞赛的基础。全国各地农业领导机关和一切农村工作干部，应当集中力量，领导好丰产评比运动，运用这个群众性的运动的力量，把我国的农业生产推进到更高的水平。
