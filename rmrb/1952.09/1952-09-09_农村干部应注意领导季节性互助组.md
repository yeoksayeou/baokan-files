　　Editor: Currently, temporary mutual aid teams in rural areas far outnumber permanent ones. In the Northwest region, the former outnumbers the latter by 80 to 90 percent. Therefore, how to cultivate these mutual aid teams and gradually improve them to play a greater role is a question worth considering. However, some departments and cadres leading agricultural production in some areas only focus on leading permanent cooperative mutual aid organizations and pay little attention to the large number of temporary mutual aid teams. In Shengshan Village, Huaxian County, Shaanxi, the Hao Shuqin mutual aid team is a first-class model mutual aid team in the county. When county, district, and township cadres go to work in this village, they only ask about the Hao Shuqin mutual aid team and do not inquire about other mutual aid teams at all. Sometimes, they even ignore the requests and questions raised by other mutual aid teams. The masses are very dissatisfied with this, saying, "Cadres only know how to lead and cultivate model mutual aid teams and do not care about us at all. Aren't model mutual aid teams cultivated from general mutual aid teams?" Many seasonal mutual aid teams have collapsed and disbanded due to a lack of leadership. I suggest that rural cadres should strengthen the leadership of temporary and seasonal mutual aid teams in accordance with the principle of "focusing on cultivation and comprehensive leadership."

    农村干部应注意领导季节性互助组
　　编辑同志：现在农村里临时性的互助组比常年的互助组要多得多，就西北地区来说，前者比后者多百分之八十到九十。因此，如何培养这些互助组，使它们逐渐提高，以便发挥更大的作用，是值得重视的问题。但是有些地方领导农业生产的部门和干部，只偏重领导常年的合作互助组织，对大量临时的互助组却不注意。陕西华县圣山村郝书勤互助组是全县的甲等模范互助组，这县的县、区、乡干部到这村去工作时，光问郝书勤互助组怎么样，对其他互助组根本不过问，有时甚至连别的互助组提出的要求和问题也不加理睬。群众对这一点很不满意，说：“干部只知道领导和培养模范互助组，对我们一点也不关心，难道模范互助组还不是从一般互助组培养出来的吗？”许多地方的季节性互助组就是因为缺乏领导而垮台散伙了。我建议农村干部应按照“重点培养，全面领导”的原则，加强对临时性、季节性互助组的领导。　　　　吴纪明
