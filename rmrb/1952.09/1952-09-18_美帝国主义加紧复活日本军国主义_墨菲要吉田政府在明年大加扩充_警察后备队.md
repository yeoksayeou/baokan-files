Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: The American plot to revive Japanese militarism in order to carry out aggressive war in the Far East has become increasingly blatant.

Following the announcement by Washington "authoritative sources" on September 11 of a plan to arm Japan with military equipment, the US Ambassador to Tokyo, Murphy, visited Japanese Liberal Party Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on the evening of the 13th to discuss the issue of rearming Japan. According to an Agence France-Presse Tokyo dispatch on the 14th, Tokyo political circles attach great importance to Murphy's meeting with Yoshida, because this meeting took place after the above-mentioned statement by Washington "authoritative sources." Furthermore, according to a report in the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" on the 15th, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the US occupation forces in Japan, General Hickey, handed Yoshida a "top secret" letter around August 20, requesting that Japan greatly expand its armed forces. An Associated Press report said: This letter is apparently a memorandum summarizing the results of US-Japan military talks.

The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported on the 16th that Murphy, on behalf of the US Department of Defense, asked Yoshida to increase the strength of the "Police Reserve Force" to 180,000 by April 1 of next year, and to 320,000 the year after.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said: "Japanese cabinet officials have begun discussing the financial aspects of the proposal to expand Japan's embryonic army to 210,000 men." The newspaper said that the proposal to expand to 210,000 men is scheduled to be implemented before August next year.

Prior to this, according to a United Press International Tokyo dispatch on the 11th, Japanese Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda had reached an agreement with US State Department consultant Dodge on increasing the budget for the Japanese "Security Force." Due to the upcoming elections, the Japanese people firmly oppose rearmament, and Hayato Ikeda dared not reveal the content of the agreement. However, according to Kyodo News Agency, quoting well-informed sources in the Japanese government, the United States has promised to help Japan rearm, and is using US-Japan cooperation to actively penetrate Southeast Asia economically as "one of the specific strategies for accelerating rearmament."

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: In order to cheer on the Japanese militarists who are eager to try in the election campaign, the United States has indicated that it will step up the rearmament of Japan. According to a United Press report, Washington "authoritative sources" revealed on the 11th that US military officials are drafting a plan to "aid" Japan with military equipment in the fiscal year beginning this July. The plan drafted by the US Department of Defense staff stipulates that war materials worth millions of dollars will be supplied to Japan. They stated that the war materials the United States plans to give Japan will exceed the war materials the United States gives to Indochina.

While Washington is planning to step up the arming of Japan, the work of actually arming Japan is being accelerated. According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" will receive 180 artillery pieces and 160 tanks from the US military in September. Furthermore, according to Tokyo sources, the Police Reserve Force, which will be renamed the "Security Force" from October 15, plans to conduct joint land-air combat training next year. The "Security Force" will become a combat force composed of air units, mechanized units, artillery, and infantry. The Deputy Director-General of the "Security Agency," Keikichi Masuhara, announced on the 11th that six large military training grounds, each covering 25,000 acres, will be allocated to the "Security Force" for use in the next fiscal year. In addition, there will be a number of "Security Force" training grounds, ranging from 20 to 250 acres, distributed throughout the country.

Masuhara Keikichi announced when hosting reporters on the 13th that the Japanese maritime forces originally planned to lease 60 US warships, but have since added eight escort frigates. The existing two naval bases will also be expanded to five.

The air force, which had been abolished after Japan's surrender, is also being revived with the active support of the United States. Kyodo News Agency reported that the Japanese "Security Agency" will receive 120 American aircraft by mid-October. The "Security Agency" plans to establish an aviation school in Hamamatsu on October 15, and plans to train 1,000 pilots by the end of next year. It also plans to immediately build twelve airports throughout Japan for air force use. Kyodo News Agency said: "After the 'Security Force' obtains these weapons and equipment from the United States and trains its cadres, it will 'essentially possess the functions of a modern army and lay the foundation for a new national army.'"

    美帝国主义加紧复活日本军国主义
    墨菲要吉田政府在明年大加扩充“警察后备队”
    【新华社十七日讯】美国复活日本军国主义以便在远东进行侵略战争的阴谋已愈来愈表面化。
    紧接着华盛顿“权威人士”在九月十一日宣布以军备武装日本的计划之后，美国驻东京大使墨菲于十三日晚访问日本自由党首相吉田茂，商讨重新武装日本的问题。据法新社十四日东京消息，东京政界人士非常重视墨菲与吉田的这次会谈，因为这次会谈是在华盛顿“权威人士”发表了上述声明之后举行的。又据日本“每日新闻”十五日透露：美国驻日占领军司令克拉克的副参谋长希凯曾在八月二十日前后将一封“极机密”的信交给吉田，要求日本大大扩充它的武装部队。美联社消息说：这封信显然是综合美日军事会谈结果的一个备忘录。
    日本“读卖新闻”十六日说：墨菲曾代表美国国防部要求吉田在明年四月一日以前将“警察后备队”的兵力增加到十八万人，后年增加到三十二万人。
    “读卖新闻”说：“日本内阁官员已开始在讨论把日本雏形陆军扩充至二十一万人的建议的财政方面问题”。该报说扩充至二十一万人的建议预定在明年八月以前实现。
    在这以前，据美国的国际新闻社东京十一日消息，日本藏相池田勇人已与美国国务院顾问道奇在增加日本“保安队”的预算问题上达成协议。由于大选在即，日本人民坚决反对重新武装，池田勇人不敢透露协议的内容。但据共同社引日本政府消息灵通人士的话说，美国已答应帮助日本重整军备，并以美日合作积极在经济上侵入东南亚为“加速重整军备的具体方策之一”。
    【新华社十五日讯】美国为了给正在竞选运动中跃跃欲试的日本军国主义分子打气，已表示它将加紧重新武装日本。据合众社消息，华盛顿“权威人士”十一日透露：美国军事官员正在拟订于今年七月开始的会计年度内以军备“援助”日本的计划。美国国防部参谋人员所拟订的方案规定以价值数百万美元的战争物资供给日本。他们表示，美国计划给日本的战争物资将超过美国给印度支那的战争物资。
    与华盛顿策划加紧武装日本的同时，实际上武装日本的工作已在加紧进行。据“东京新闻”报道，日本“警察后备队”在九月份将从美军得到大炮一百八十门、坦克一百六十辆。又据东京消息，自十月十五日起将改名为“保安队”的警察后备队计划于明年进行陆空协同作战训练，“保安队”将成为由航空队、机械化部队、炮兵和步兵组成的作战部队。“保安厅”副长官增原惠吉十一日宣布将在下一会计年度划出每个占地二万五千英亩的大军事演习场六个供“保安队”使用，此外还有若干占地二十亩至二百五十亩的“保安队”练兵场分布于全国各地。
    增原惠吉十三日招待记者时宣布，日本海上部队原定租借美军舰艇六十艘，后已增加护航快舰八艘。现有的两处海军基地也将扩充为五处。
    日本投降后已被取消的空军也在美国的积极扶植下复活。共同社报道，日本“保安厅”在十月中旬以前即可得到美国飞机一百二十架。“保安厅”准备于十月十五日在滨松成立一所航空学校，拟于明年年底训练出驾驶员一千名，并计划立即在日本各地建筑十二个机场供空军使用。共同社说：“保安队”在获得美国这些武器装备并培养了干部之后，“实质上就将具备近代军队的机能，打下新国军的基础”。
