Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: Tokyo dispatch: In view of the increasingly high tide of the Japanese people's movement against remilitarization, some reactionary parties that actively support Japan's rearmament have put away their drums and trumpets of advocating rearmament in the general election, and have also put up the banner of so-called "peace" and "self-defense."

    Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd, said: "In their election campaigns, various political parties, either because they want to win votes or because they have certain ideals, have avoided openly advocating immediate armament of Japan. Even those who support some kind of rearmament only talk about this issue in a light manner in their speeches, because they are afraid that young people and women voters will not vote for them on October 1st - the vast majority of young people and women voters have expressed opposition to rearmament, believing that rearmament will lead to war."

    For example, Japanese Prime Minister and President of the Liberal Party, Shigeru Yoshida, everyone knows that he, with the support of the United States, single-handedly established the Japanese army and navy disguised as "police." On August 4th, Yoshida even publicly said when "instructing" the cadres of the "Security Agency": "The purpose of establishing the Security Agency is to build a new national army," "I hope you can become the backbone of the new national army and lay the foundation for the new army." Despite this, he shouted everywhere in the election campaign "oppose rearmament" and pretentiously emphasized the difficulties of Japan's rearmament. However, black and white cannot be confused. Kyodo News Agency commented on Yoshida's August 4th speech on August 8th and affirmed that "regardless of whether the government (regarding rearmament) unilaterally denies it or does not deny it, the Prime Minister has given the people the impression that he has recently decided to rearm, which has become an undeniable fact."

    Another example is the group of Liberal Party members led by Ichiro Hatoyama, who were still talking loudly about rearmament before the start of the election campaign. However, since the start of the election, this group has also followed in the footsteps of the Yoshida faction, and their tone has softened.

    At the same time, the groups of Koki Hirota and Hitoshi Ashida in the Reform Party also openly clamored for rearmament like the Hatoyama group in the past. When Hitoshi Ashida invited Koki Hirota to serve as the president of the Reform Party in early May this year, Koki Hirota listed his various policies, among which "the most important things are the revision of the constitution and the rearmament" (Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, May 6th). But now they are also hurriedly calling off the dogs, "taking a roundabout approach to the issue of immediate rearmament."

    The taboo attitude of these reactionary party leaders towards the issue of rearmament reflects the daily increase in the strength of the Japanese people's opposition to remilitarization. Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, 17th, frankly said when mentioning the ambiguous attitude of the "right-wing Socialist Party, Cooperative Party, Reform Party, and Liberal Party in the right-wing camp" towards the rearmament issue: "The ongoing election struggle shows that the proposition of 'rearmament,' like the proposition of 'defending capitalism,' gives people a feeling of reaction. Under this atmosphere of the people, rearmament is a taboo. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the mindset of right-wing parties and candidates who want to win support and win a majority of seats in trying to avoid rearmament."

### 日本一些反动政党在大选中都收起鼓吹重新武装的锣鼓

    日本一些反动政党在大选中都收起鼓吹重新武装的锣鼓
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：鉴于日本人民反对重新军国主义化的运动愈来愈高涨，一些积极支持日本重新武装的反动政党，在大选中都收起鼓吹重新武装的锣鼓，也打出了所谓“和平”“自卫”的招牌。
    共同社东京二十二日电说：“各政党在它们的竞选运动中，或由于想争取选票，或由于抱有某种理想，因而都避免公开鼓吹立即武装日本。即使那些赞成某种重新武装的人，也都在他们的讲演中轻描淡写地就这一问题谈谈，因为他们怕十月一日投票时青年和妇女选民不投他们的票——绝大多数的青年和妇女选民已表示反对重新武装，他们认为重新武装会导致战争。”
    例如日本首相、自由党总裁吉田茂，人人都知道他在美国的扶植下一手建立了以“警察”为外衣的日本陆海军。八月四日，吉田在向“保安厅”的干部“训话”时并曾公开说：“成立保安厅的目的在于建设新国军”，“希望你们能成为新国军的骨干，奠定新军的基础”。虽然如此，他在竞选运动中却到处叫喊“反对重整军备”，并且装模作样地强调日本重新武装的困难。但是，黑白是不容混淆的。共同社在八月八日评论吉田八月四日的谈话时就已经肯定“不管政府（对于重整军备）是片面否定或不否定，首相给国民一种最近决心重整军备的印象，已经成了不能否认的事实。”
    再如以鸠山一郎为首的一派自由党人，在竞选运动开始以前还高谈阔论重新武装，但是，自竞选开始后，这一派也与吉田派亦步亦趋，口气变温和了。
    同时，改进党中的重光葵和芦田均集团，以前也和鸠山集团一样地公开叫嚣重新武装，今年五月初芦田均邀请重光葵出任改进党总裁时，重光葵列举了他的各项政策，其中“特别以修改宪法、重整军备为其最大的紧要事情”（共同社东京五月六日电）。但现在也慌忙地偃旗息鼓，“在立即重新武装这个问题上，采取旁敲侧击的态度了”。
    这些反动党派首脑人物对重新武装问题的忌讳态度，反映出日本人民反对重新军国主义化的力量在一天天地增加。共同社东京十七日电在提到“右翼阵营的右派社会党、协同党、改进党和自由党”对重新武装问题的暧昧态度时率直地说：“现实正在进行着的大选斗争，‘重整军备’的主张和‘保卫资本主义’的主张一样，给人一种反动性质的感觉，在国民的这种气氛下，重整军备就是禁语，因此，要争取支持和争取多数当选的右翼政党及候选人企图回避重整军备的心境，是不难了解的。”更正
    九月二十三日本报四版刊登的“美国在日本的军事基地及军事设施图”和“资料”中，“兰波滩岛”应为“蔺滩波岛”。
