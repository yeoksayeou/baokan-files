    Xinhua News Agency: The Northeast Labor Employment Committee has been established and held its first meeting from August 20th to 22nd to discuss labor employment issues in the Northeast region. More than 80 people attended the meeting, including members of the Northeast Labor Employment Committee and responsible cadres from labor, personnel, and civil affairs departments at the provincial, municipal, and Northeast levels. The meeting discussed the draft "Plan for Handling Labor Employment Issues in the Northeast Region." Zhang Mingyuan, Secretary-General of the Northeast People's Government, delivered a concluding report at the end of the meeting. He said: Since 1949, the Northeast region has solved many labor employment problems with the development of economic construction. In state-owned and public enterprises and public education personnel alone, the number of people employed has exceeded 1.4 million. However, there are still a few unemployed and underemployed people. In order to do a good job in labor employment, he instructed relevant departments to allocate labor in a planned and organized manner, and to expand employment as much as possible, so as to quickly solve the labor employment problem in the Northeast region. Zhang Mingyuan finally requested that all localities first clarify the situation in order to quickly move into registration and review work. In order to start this work as soon as possible, provinces and cities should quickly establish labor employment committees.

    东北劳动就业委员会已成立
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：东北劳动就业委员会已经成立，并在八月二十日到二十二日召开第一次会议，讨论东北区劳动就业问题。出席此次会议的有东北劳动就业委员会的委员；各省、市和东北一级劳动、人事、民政各部门的负责干部共八十多人。会议讨论了“东北区处理劳动就业问题的方案”草案。会议最后由东北人民政府秘书长张明远作总结报告。他说：东北地区自一九四九年以来，随着经济建设的发展已解决了不少劳动就业问题，仅国营公营企业和公教人员方面，劳动就业的人数就有一百四十多万人。但目前尚有少数失业和半失业者。为了做好劳动就业工作，他指示各有关部门应有计划有组织地调配劳动力，尽量扩大就业面，把东北地区的劳动就业问题迅速加以解决。张明远最后要求各地首先要弄清情况，以便迅速转入登记、审查工作。为了尽早开始这项工作，各省、市应迅速建立起劳动就业委员会。
