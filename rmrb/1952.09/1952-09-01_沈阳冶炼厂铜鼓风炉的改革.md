    Reform of the Copper Blast Furnace at Shenyang Smelting Plant
    By our reporter Lin Mo
    Here is a story about the reform of the copper blast furnace at the Shenyang Smelting Plant. This story tells us that the Chinese working class, with the selfless assistance of Soviet comrades, is fully utilizing its own wisdom to rapidly improve and enhance production technology. Such speed was impossible in the era of imperialism and its running dogs. But it also shows that in order to move forward more quickly, it is necessary to conduct in-depth education work among the workers, overcome certain conservative ideas among them, and make them learn and create advanced experiences with a higher sense of ownership.

    I. The Furnace Needs Reform

    This spring, the Shenyang Smelting Plant encountered a serious problem: the entire plant had to complete a greater task of increasing production and practicing economy in 1952, but the copper blast furnace could not keep up with the requirements, which in turn affected the normal operation of the converter and roasting furnaces. Originally, the copper blast furnace was operated according to the old methods left by the Japanese, which could only smelt "rich ore" but not "poor ore," because the "poor ore" contained more sulfur, and the desulfurization rate of the blast furnace did not meet the requirements. However, these "poor ores" contained particularly large amounts of gold and silver. If this continued, let alone increasing production, even the original planned tasks for copper, gold, and silver could not be completed. From the perspective of future development, the national industrial construction urgently needs more copper, and there is not enough "rich ore," so "poor ore" must also be mined in large quantities. However, in the smelting plant, a large amount of "poor ore" was piled up and could not be put into the furnace. How could this be allowed? From top to bottom, everyone in the smelting plant was worried about this matter, and the workers and technicians of the copper blast furnace were working around the furnace day and night. All kinds of methods were used, but the furnace still did not obey.

    At this time, Soviet expert Kundrasov arrived. He talked to everyone for several days and carefully inspected the furnace. He used an iron rod to pick up the flowing copper liquid and looked at it, knowing that the furnace was not burning well and that the silicic acid was not playing its proper chemical reaction in the furnace. Kundrasov had worked on copper furnaces for eighteen years, and he could tell the various components it contained by looking at the copper that was smelted. Finally, he proposed that to completely solve the problem of desulfurization rate, it was necessary to abolish the old method of adding coal to the tuyeres, which was left by the Japanese.

    II. How Were Old Conventions Retained?

    Originally, when the Japanese burned this furnace, they needed six workers to guard the tuyeres day and night, adding coal to the tuyeres every five minutes. This method was not only a waste of manpower, but more badly, frequently opening the tuyeres resulted in a loss of a lot of wind; due to uneven ventilation and coal addition, the oxidation in the furnace was poor, and the desulfurization rate was not high. However, at that time, they only selected the "rich ore" with the most copper to smelt, and even if the furnace burned poorly, it could still be smelted; at the same time, using workers to add coal from the tuyeres could also manage to burn less coke, since China had plenty of cheap labor. After liberation, due to the conservative thinking of many people and fear of difficulties, this method was retained.

    As early as 1949, a young worker named Bai Liming in the copper furnace tuyere group tried to abolish "tuyere coal." At that time, he felt that "tuyere coal" had three major drawbacks: the workers were too tired; it was easy to cause work injuries -- either being hit in the face by coal lumps blown out of the tuyeres, or being hit in the head by the wind gate; and what was even more annoying was that if the furnace had a malfunction, it would be blamed on poor tuyere operation. Bai Liming had heard some technicians say that the quality of the furnace burn did not depend on adding coal at the tuyeres, but mainly on whether the coke was added appropriately and whether the ventilation was good. He also saw a technician sitting there calmly when looking at the tuyeres, adding coal once every half an hour, and the furnace did not have any problems. He thought: could the tuyeres simply not be fed coal? However, he neither obtained the help of technicians, nor dared to make suggestions to the administration, nor even dared to let ordinary workers know, so he and another worker secretly started doing it. They tried to gradually extend the time for adding coal, from once every five minutes to ten minutes, twenty minutes, all the way to two or three hours, and the furnace was still burning as usual. Finally, it was once every four hours, expanding from one tuyere to four tuyeres. However, due to the lack of coordination in other aspects, the furnace suddenly malfunctioned. The leadership did not study the reason for this, and no longer allowed such "reckless behavior."

    In 1950, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the factory officially proposed to abolish "tuyere coal." However, at this time, neither the leading cadres nor the technicians had cleared their minds. They made no preparations and did not mobilize, so the factory director issued an order to the smelting department director, who issued an order to the section chief, who told a squad leader in the tuyere group: "The higher-ups said to abolish 'tuyere coal', and your squad will do the experiment. Report any problems to the higher-ups." The squad leader wanted to ask how to do it, but when he looked up, the section chief was already gone. The workers threw down their coal shovels, and did not add coal for four hours in a row, and the furnace burned out the water jacket. As soon as the department heard that there was an accident, it quickly ordered the experiment to be stopped. Some people said: "It's obviously not going to work, but you have to experiment. You won't give up until something goes wrong!"

    Two failed experiments further fueled the conservative thinking of the employees. This time, hearing that "tuyere coal" was going to be abolished again, many people did not say it, but their hearts were naturally full of doubts. The workers in the tuyere group were also afraid that after "tuyere coal" was abolished, their skills would no longer be useful, and their lives would be affected. Although the technicians theoretically knew the benefits of not adding coal to the tuyeres, they felt that it was a different kind of furnace. Now that they wanted to change it, they were afraid that they would have to fundamentally overhaul the furnace.

    III. The Determination of Leading Cadres

    However, the thinking of the leading cadres was different this time. The higher-level leading organ of the smelting plant, the Northeast Industrial Department's Nonferrous Metals Bureau, had already criticized the bourgeois views of some technicians and established the idea of resolutely learning from advanced Soviet technology. The bureau said to the cadres in the factory: "With the guidance of Soviet experts, you can be bold and do it. As long as you can learn from advanced Soviet experience, you will definitely succeed!" The factory director announced to everyone at the beginning: "This time, abolishing 'tuyere coal' is not an experiment, but it must be done this way; only success is allowed, and failure is not allowed!" The leading comrades of the department and section explained to everyone the history of the furnace, the current situation, and the future development, as well as the political and economic significance. Soviet experts gave lessons to technicians and workers, analyzing technically why "tuyere coal" could be abolished, what problems would be encountered after abolishing it, and how to operate it. All the preparations that could be thought of and should be made were made, and everyone was full of unified confidence: this time it would definitely succeed, and there would be no more problems.

    IV. Failure and Wavering

    At one o'clock in the morning on April 21st, the tuyeres stopped adding coal, but the air pressure was not adjusted in time, and the wind, after entering, blew straight up. This wind blew up the ore, and even the mouth of the furnace was emitting red flames. The workers kept feeding the furnace, but couldn't suppress it. The material that went in was burned and stuck to the furnace wall. It was not until Soviet expert Kundrasov arrived at eight o'clock in the morning that the air pressure was reduced. Although the wind no longer blew so much at this time, the furnace blocks formed on the furnace wall became more and more, and the workers could not finish hitting them no matter how hard they tried. By the night of the next day, the melting capacity of the furnace was already very small, and it took a long, long time for the material added to go down, and the inside gradually turned black. People were shouting: "The furnace is about to die!" Some people wavered, and some people proposed to add coal from the tuyeres to save the furnace, and even some party members and league members were not firm. In the end, coal was added from the tuyeres to temporarily save the furnace. What to do? Abolish "tuyere coal" and the furnace will die; restore "tuyere coal" and the furnace will live again.

    On April 23rd, the factory director convened a meeting of cadres. Soviet expert Kundrasov analyzed the technical reasons for the failure at the meeting, explained the methods for correction, and encouraged everyone not to be discouraged by temporary failure. He said: Technical reform is like making revolution. Can a revolution be made halfway and then abandoned? People thought: Yes, didn't the Chinese people succeed in making revolution only after many failures! Then, Kundrasov summarized the reasons for this failure from the technical operation. The next day, it started again.

    V. With the Help of Experts, You Still Have to Use Your Own Brains

    This time, the expert personally guided everyone on the furnace, and the furnace passed peacefully that day. The furnace worked the same way even without adding coal to the tuyeres. However, every time the expert was not there, the furnace would have problems again. "Can we let the expert guard everyone day and night and work in place of everyone?" Of course not. The Chinese working class must learn and create a set of methods to master their own machines!

    In May, a large-scale movement to find tricks and promote advanced experience was launched among workers in the entire Northeast region. This movement promoted the workers here. The section decided to first promote the experience of the charging group of Team B, because Team B worked best under the direct help of Soviet experts. In the past, when adding coal to the tuyeres, the quality of the furnace was largely determined by the operation of the tuyere group, but now it mainly depends on the charging. The technician summarized the more than 30 tricks proposed by the charging workers into five charging methods, wrote them out and posted them in the rest room, and called on the workers of Team A and Team C to learn.

    VI. "Old Laggards" Look Down on Advanced Experience

    As soon as learning from Team B was mentioned, Hu Qishan, the deputy squad leader of Team A, was the first to disagree. He said: "What five major methods, six major methods, let me, Old Hu, show them a couple of tricks!" Hu Qishan had worked on this furnace the longest, and was also deeply poisoned by the old society. After liberation, his old mind had never been able to turn around, so some people called him "Old Laggard." When Hu Qishan and Han Xianchen, the leader of the charging group of his team, went to watch Team B's charging operation, they said they were learning advanced experience, but their eyes were only picking faults. After watching for a while, Han Xianchen felt that there was nothing particularly mysterious about it. Some workers in Team B were impatient with Hu Qishan's appearance, and Cao Mingzhu, the leader of the charging group, also had some selfishness, so he was not enthusiastic about teaching. With neither side being enthusiastic, Team B's experience could not be promoted naturally.

    VII. The Success of Youth League Member Li Jinghe's Learning, Creation, and Reform

    At this time, Team C had the worst performance, because the backbone members of Team C did not pay much attention to finding tricks and learning advanced experience. Later, after continuous criticism and education from the party, league, and administration, everyone's minds became active. Finally, it was decided that Li Jinghe and Jin Sheng would go to work two hours early every day to learn from Team B.

    Li Jinghe stood by the furnace mouth, watching Team B charge the furnace time and time again. But after looking at it again and again, he couldn't see any major difference from what his team was doing now. Later, he also talked to Hu Zhende, the deputy leader of the charging group of Team B. Although Hu Zhende was usually very attentive to his work, he would use good methods himself when he found them, and he couldn't explain them even if he wanted to. Li Jinghe spent a lot of effort talking to him for a long time, but couldn't get any tricks out of him, and thought that these three hours had been wasted again. But at this time, Li Jinghe paid attention and saw Hu Zhende using a shovel to add the remaining crushed material against the furnace wall, one shovel at a time, after others had loaded the material. He asked Old Hu why he did this, and Old Hu said: "This way, the furnace edge won't catch fire." Li Jinghe was reminded by this sentence. He punched Old Hu on the back and said:

    "Haha, so that's how you do it!" He ran back quickly.

    Originally, Hu Zhende would only use the method of "use crushed material to suppress fire at the furnace edge" sometimes when he saw that the furnace was not burning properly. He himself did not think that this was any great experience; the technician did not summarize this point when summarizing Team B's charging experience. But for Li Jinghe, this point was very important. Originally, when working in Team C, furnace blocks would often form on the furnace wall. Li Jinghe also knew that this was because the furnace edge was on fire, but he only looked for problems at the tuyeres, and could not find a solution no matter what. This time, seeing Old Hu doing this, he suddenly understood. When he ran down from the furnace, he remembered that the technician had also said that the furnace edge catching fire was related to the flatness of the material surface (i.e., the surface of the mineral material in the furnace). Now, seeing Old Hu adding crushed material to the edge, making the edge higher, he could suppress the edge from catching fire, which was the same principle as what the technician said. Later, he also remembered that Hua Benren, a labor model on the lead furnace last year, created the bottom-shaped charging method, which greatly improved the production of the lead furnace. This charging method was also to make the edge of the material surface high and the middle concave. The mouth of the copper furnace is not round, and although the material surface cannot be made into a bottom shape, a slope can be formed from the edge to the middle. Can a slope-shaped charging method be developed? He first talked about this idea with Chen Zairen, the squad leader of the two teams, and Zhao Puying, the chairman of the workshop trade union, and then talked to the technician. The technician went back to check the books, and also went to talk to an engineer from the bureau. That afternoon, the factory approved their experiment. They experimented continuously for three shifts, and the furnace no longer had the old problems. The matte produced exceeded the other two teams in both quantity and quality. The Soviet expert came to see it and said that this method was good, but he thought that using shovels to load the material completely was too tiring, so he helped everyone change to using mine cars. As long as the angle and distance of the car tipping were controlled, the mineral material could go down against the furnace edge, making the material surface a slope. This was less strenuous than the original method, and it also increased the speed of charging by two times.

    VIII. The Rebirth of the Copper Blast Furnace

    The factory affirmed that the "slope-shaped charging method" was a good experience, and decided to promote it in Team A and Team B. In the past, Team A was unwilling to learn from Team B's experience, but this time they learned the fastest. Originally, Hu Qishan, the deputy squad leader of Team A, and Han Xianchen, the leader of the charging group, had been strictly criticized by the section for not learning advanced experience modestly last time. Han Xianchen was a member of the Youth League, and the League also held a meeting to educate him. This time, when he heard that he was going to learn from Team C's experience, he first held a meeting in his group to mobilize, reviewed his past wrong attitudes, and made everyone have a correct understanding. After the mobilization, he went to invite Li Jinghe to introduce the experience. Seeing that Team A warmly welcomed him, Li Jinghe gladly explained to everyone while actually demonstrating, repeatedly for more than two hours. Li Jinghe was sweating profusely, and finally said humbly that this method was not created by their Team C either. This was the result of their visiting Team B's practices, plus the help of technicians, engineers, and Soviet experts, and everyone's reference and research. Everyone should continue to improve it in the future.

    After Li Jinghe left, Han Xianchen said to everyone: "Comrades, if we don't study hard, we will not only be sorry to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, but we will also be sorry to ourselves!" At this time, Hu Qishan was also moved. He said: "Yes, if I don't study and don't make progress in the future, I will have no face to see anyone. Everyone keep an eye on me!" Originally, Hu Qishan was still unconvinced when he was criticized by the section. Later, the section chief, the party branch secretary, and the trade union chairman took turns talking to him for several days, inspiring his class consciousness through the suffering and oppression he had suffered in the past. Han Xianchen in the squad also helped him concretely, and he began to realize his mistakes. Today, Li Jinghe's enthusiastic help and everyone's enthusiastic learning have taken him a step further.

    The squad leaders, group leaders, and workers of Team A were all determined to learn the new charging method, and they learned it in just one week.

    In total, during the trick-finding movement in May, the workers on the copper furnace proposed more than 100 tricks, which were initially summarized and summarized by technicians into "five major charging methods" and "seven tuyere handling methods." During the promotion process, after supplementation and modification, the new operating regulations were finally formulated through research and discussion by all employees. Now, the workers are operating in accordance with the new regulations, and the old set has died. The copper blast furnace has been reborn in the hands of the Chinese working class. The desulfurization rate of the copper furnace has increased from 30% to 50%, which is close to the Soviet standard, and is no longer afraid of "poor ore" and "difficult ore."

    沈阳冶炼厂铜鼓风炉的改革
    本报记者  林沫
    这里讲一个沈阳冶炼厂改革铜鼓风炉的故事。这故事告诉我们：中国工人阶级正在苏联同志无私的帮助下，充分发挥自己的智慧，迅速地改进与提高生产的技术。这样的速度在帝国主义及其走狗统治的时代是不可能的。但这里也说明：要想更迅速地前进，还必须在工人中进行深入的教育工作，克服工人中某些保守思想，使他们以更高的主人翁的自觉来学习与创造先进经验。
    一、炉子需要改革
    今年春季，沈阳冶炼厂遇到一个严重问题：全厂要在一九五二年完成更大的增产节约任务，但铜鼓风炉赶不上要求，接连影响到真吹炉和焙烧炉也不能正常工作。原来铜鼓风炉是按照日本留下来的老办法操作的，只能炼“富矿”，不能炼“贫矿”，因为“贫矿”含的硫多，鼓风炉的脱硫率达不到要求。但这些“贫矿”含的金、银却特别多，如果这样继续下去，别说增产，连铜、金、银三项原定的任务也完不成了。从今后发展上看，全国的工业建设正迫切需要更多的铜，“富矿”不够，“贫矿”也必须大量开采。而在冶炼厂，却堆积着大批“贫矿”不能下炉子，这还能行吗？冶炼厂从上到下人人都为这事焦心，铜鼓风炉的工友和技术人员一天围着炉子打转。什么办法都使上了，炉子还是不听话。
    正当这时候，苏联专家崑德拉索夫来到了。他一连几天找大家谈话，仔细查看炉子。他拿铁棍挑起流出的铜水看了，知道炉子烧得不好，矽酸在炉子里没有起到应有的化学反应。崑德拉索夫在铜炉上工作过十八年，他看看炼出的铜，就能知道它所含的各种成分。最后他提出，要彻底解决脱硫率的问题，必须取消过去日本人留下的在风口打煤的老办法。
    二、老的成规怎样保留下来的？
    原来日本人烧这座炉子的时候，要用六个工人日夜守住通风口，每隔五分钟从风口上一次煤。这办法不只是浪费人力，更坏的是经常开动风口要损失很多风；因通风、打煤不均匀，影响到炉子里边氧化作用不良，脱硫率不高。但当时是只挑含铜最多的“富矿”炼，炉子烧得再差也可以炼得出；同时用工人从风口打煤，还可以将就着少烧些焦炭，反正中国有的是廉价的劳动力。解放后，由于许多人还有保守思想，害怕困难，这办法就被保留下来了。
    早在一九四九年，铜炉风口组有个名叫白立明的青年工人，就曾试着要取消“风口煤”。他当时感到“风口煤”有三大坏处：工人干活太累；容易出工伤——不是被风口吹出的煤块打伤脸，就是被风闸碰伤头；更讨厌的是炉子一出故障，就归究到风口操作不良。白立明曾听到有的技术人员说，炉子烧得好坏，不在乎风口打煤，主要是看焦炭加得是否适当，通风是否良好。他还看到有一个技术员在看风口的时候，坐在那里很安闲，半点钟打一次煤，炉子也不出毛病。他就想：风口是不是可以干脆不打煤呢？但是，他既没有取得技术人员的帮助，也没有敢向行政上建议，甚至连一般工友也不敢让知道，他就和另外一个工友偷偷干起来了。他们试着逐渐延长打煤的时间，从五分钟打一次到十分钟、二十分钟一直到两三个钟头打一次，炉子还是照样烧着。最后是四个钟头打一次，从一个风口扩大到四个风口。但是，因为缺乏其他方面的配合，炉子突然出了毛病。领导方面也没有研究其中道理，就再不许这么“胡干”了。
    一九五零年，厂里根据苏联专家的建议，正式提出要取消“风口煤”。但这时连领导干部带技术人员都没有打通思想。他们既没有准备，也没有动员，就由厂长下命令给熔炼部主任，主任下命令给股长，股长告诉风口组的一个班长说：“上级说了，要取消‘风口煤’，由你们班作试验，有什么问题向上级汇报。”班长想问问怎么作，抬头一看，股长已经不见了。工友们把煤铲一撂，一连四个钟头没打煤，炉子里把水套烧坏了。部里一听出了事故，就赶紧下命令停止试验。有些人说：“明明不行，偏要试验，非等出了事才死心！”
    两次试验失败，更助长了职工的保守思想。这回听说又要取消“风口煤”，很多人嘴里不说，心里自然满是怀疑。风口组的工友还害怕取消“风口煤”之后自己这门技术吃不开了，生活要受影响。技术人员虽然从理论上知道风口不打煤的好处，但觉得那是另外一种炉子。如今要改变，恐怕得根本改修炉子。
    三、领导干部的决心
    但是，领导干部的思想这一次却不同了。冶炼厂的上级领导机关东北工业部有色金属管理局已经批判了某些技术人员的资产阶级观点，树立了坚决学习苏联先进技术的思想。局里向厂里的干部说：“有苏联专家的指导，你们就大胆干，只要你们能好好学习苏联先进经验，就一定能成功！”厂长一开始就向大家宣布：“这次取消‘风口煤’不是试验，而是一定要这样作；只许成功，不许失败！”部和股的领导同志们从炉子的历史、目前的情况及将来的发展、政治上和经济上的意义，向大家进行解说。苏联专家给技术人员和工友上课，从技术上分析“风口煤”为什么可以取消，取消后会遇到什么问题，如何进行操作。凡是想到的、应作的准备工作都作了，大家都怀着一致的信心：这次一定会成功，再不会有什么问题了。
    四、失败和动摇
    四月二十一日早晨一点钟，风口停止打煤了，但没有及时调整风压，风进去之后就一股劲往上吹。这股风把矿石吹起来，连炉口都冒起了红火，工人不停地进料也压它不住，料进去就被烧化，沾在炉壁上了。一直到上午八点钟苏联专家来了，才把风压降低。这时风虽不再那么吹了，炉壁上结的炉块却越来越多，工友们不停地打也打不完。到第二天夜里，炉子的熔化能力已经很小，加进料去很久很久也不往下降，里边逐渐黑下来。人们吵着：“炉子快要死了！”有的人发生动摇，有的人提出要从风口打煤来救炉子，连有些党员和团员也不坚定了。最后还是从风口打进煤去，暂时把炉子救了下来。怎么办呢？取消“风口煤”，炉子要死；恢复“风口煤”，炉子却又活了。
    四月二十三日，厂长召集了干部会，苏联专家崑德拉索夫在会上分析了技术上失败的原因，说明了改正的办法，鼓励大家绝不要因一时的失败而灰心，他说：技术改革好比闹革命，闹革命能闹到半路就撩下算了吗？人们一想：是呵，中国人民闹革命不是经过多次失败才成功的吗！接着，崑德拉索夫从技术操作上总结了这次失败的原因。第二天又重新开始了。
    五、有专家帮助还得自己动脑筋
    这次专家亲自在炉子上指导大家操作，这天炉子平平安安地过去了，风口不加煤炉子也照样工作了。但是，每到专家不在的时候，炉子就又出毛病。“能让专家日夜守着大家、代替大家来工作吗？”当然不能，中国的工人阶级必须学习和创造出一套办法来掌握自己的机器啊！
    五月间，全东北区的工人开展了大规模的找窍门和推广先进经验的运动，这一运动推动了这里的工人。股里决定先推广乙班进料组的经验，因为乙班在苏联专家直接帮助下工作得最好。过去风口打煤的时候，炉子的好坏大半决定于风口组的操作，现在则主要决定于进料了。技术员把进料的工友提出的三十多个窍门，总结出五项进料的方法，写出贴在休息室里，号召甲班和丙班的工友学习。
    六、“老落后”瞧不起先进经验
    一提向乙班学习，甲班副班长胡岐山就头一个不服气，他说：“什么五大法、六大法的，看我老胡拿两手给他们看看！”胡岐山在这炉子上工作得最久，受旧社会的毒害也深。解放后老脑筋一直转不过来，所以有人叫他“老落后”。胡岐山和本班进料组长韩宪臣去看乙班表演进料操作时，嘴里说是学习先进经验，但两个眼睛只在挑毛病。韩宪臣看了一阵，觉得并没有什么特别奥妙的地方。乙班有些工友看着胡岐山那样子，心里不耐烦，加上进料组组长曹明柱也有几分私心，教得也就不热心。双方都不热心，乙班的经验自然不能推广。
    七、青年团员李景和的学习、创造和改革的成功
    这时成绩最差的是丙班，原因是丙班的骨干分子对找窍门和学习先进经验不大重视。后来经过党内、团内和行政方面的不断批评、教育，大家的脑筋活动起来了。最后决定李景和与金生两人每天提前两个钟头上班，到乙班去学习。
    李景和站在炉口边，看着乙班一次一次地进料。但看来看去，实在也看不出和自己班里现在干的有什么大不同。后来他又找乙班进料组副组长胡振德谈。胡振德虽平常对工作确实很用心，但他摸到好方法就自己使用，要他讲他也讲不上来。李景和费劲地和他谈了很久，也没谈出什么窍门，心想这三    个钟头又算白报消了。但这时李景和一留心，却看见胡振德在别人装过料之后，自己又用铁锹将剩下的碎料一锹一锹贴着炉壁添进去。他问老胡为什么这样干，老胡说：“这样炉边就不会上火了。”李景和被这一句话提醒了，他照老胡背上打了一拳说：
    “哈哈，原来你们是这么干的呀！”他飞快地跑回去了。
    原来，“炉边上火，用碎料压”这个办法，胡振德也只是有时见炉子烧得不对了，就这么干它一下，他自己并不觉得这是什么了不起的经验；技术员在总结乙班的进料经验时，也没有把这点总结进去。但对李景和来说，这点却很重要。原来在丙班工作时，炉壁上老结炉块。李景和也知道这是炉边上了火，但只是在风口那里找毛病，怎么也找不出办法。这次看老胡这么干，他恍然大悟了。他从炉子上跑下来时，想起过去技术员也讲过，说炉边上火和料面（即炉内矿料的表面）太平有关系。现在看到老胡把碎料添在边上，边上高了，就可以压住边上不上火，这和技术员讲的是一个道理。后来他又想起去年铅炉上的劳动模范华本仁创造了锅底形进料法，使铅炉的生产大大提高，这种进料的方法也就是使料面边上高，中间凹。铜炉的炉口不是圆的，料面虽然不能成锅底形，但从边上到中间也可以形成一个斜坡，是不是可以搞成一个坡形的进料法呢？他把这个思想先和两班班长陈在仁、车间工会主席肇普英他们谈了，以后又和技术员谈。技术员回去查了书，又去找局里来的一个工程师谈了，当天下午厂里就批准他们试验。他们接连试验了三班，炉子再也没有从前的毛病了。炼出的冰铜，量和质都超过其他两班。苏联专家来看了，也说这办法好，但他认为完全使用铁锹装料太累，他又帮助大家改用矿车装，只要掌握好翻车的角度和距离，矿料就可以贴炉边下去，使料面成为坡形。这样干比原先的办法省力，又使进料的速度提高了两倍。
    八、铜鼓风炉的新生
    厂里肯定了“坡形进料法”是一条好经验，决定要在甲、乙两班推广。过去甲班不肯学习乙班的经验，这次却算他们学习得最快。原来甲班副班长胡岐山和进料组长韩宪臣上次因不虚心学习先进经验，股里对他们进行了严格的批评。韩宪臣是青年团员，团里也开会对他进行了教育。这次他听说要学习丙班的经验，就首先在组里开会动员，检讨了自己过去的错误态度，使大家都有了正确的认识。动员好了，他就去请李景和来介绍经验。李景和看到甲班热烈欢迎他，便满心高兴地一边给大家讲，一边实际作给大家看，反反复复地一连搞了两个多钟头。李景和头上冒着热气，最后虚心地说，这办法也并不是他们丙班创造出来的，这是他们参观了乙班的作法，加上技术员、工程师和苏联专家的帮助，大家参考、研究出来的，今后还要大家继续改进。
    李景和走后，韩宪臣向大家说：“同志们，咱们要是不好好学习，不用说对不起共产党，对不起毛主席，连咱们自己也对不起了！”这时，胡岐山也被感动了。他说：“对，我今后再要不学习、不进步，就没脸见人了，大家拿眼睛看着我吧！”原来胡岐山在受到股里的批评时，心里还是不服气。后来股长、党支部书记和工会主席接连几天轮流找他谈话，通过他过去所受的痛苦和压迫来启发他的阶级觉悟，班里韩宪臣又具体帮助他，他开始认识了自己的错误。今天李景和的热忱帮助和大家的热情学习，使他又进了一步。
    甲班的班长、组长和工友们都下决心学习新的进料方法，不过一个星期就学会了。
    总计在五月份的找窍门运动中，铜炉上的工友共提出了一百多个窍门，经技术人员初步归纳、总结为“进料五大法”和“风口七项处理法”。在推广过程中经过补充和修改，最后经全体职工研究、讨论，订出了新的操作规程。现在，工友们已经按照新的规程进行操作，旧的一套已经死亡了。铜鼓风炉在中国工人阶级手里新生了。铜炉的脱硫率从百分之三十提高到百分之五十，已经接近了苏联的标准，再也不怕“贫矿”和“难矿”了。
