Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st—Tokyo News: Under pressure from the Japanese people, the Yoshida government announced on August 28th the early dissolution of the House of Representatives and scheduled a general election for October 1st of this year.

    The current members of the Japanese House of Representatives were elected in January 1949, with a four-year term. The Yoshida reactionary clique relied on despicable means to fraudulently obtain a majority of votes in that election and continue to hold power. Since the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in September of last year, the Yoshida government's crimes of acting against the tide have intensified, and it has manipulated the Diet to pass a series of treaties and fascist bills that violate the interests of the Japanese nation. Therefore, the Japanese people and various opposition parties in Japan unanimously demanded the resignation of the Yoshida government and the early dissolution of the Diet and holding of a general election. The Yoshida government had brazenly disregarded public opinion, arrogantly insisting repeatedly on "completing the term before holding a general election," and in order to force the Diet to pass various anti-people bills, extended the statutory session of 150 days for the 13th Diet session, which began on December 10th of last year, five times in succession, becoming an unprecedented "long-term Diet" lasting 235 days, which only closed on July 31st of this year, passing hundreds of bills that violated the interests of the people. The Yoshida government even planned to submit a supplementary budget formulated to accelerate the resurgence of militarism, a "Law for the Suppression of Collective Demonstrations," and a so-called "US-Japan Aviation Agreement," etc., for approval in the current Diet session starting on August 26th. The Japanese people could not tolerate this situation, and they increasingly demanded an early general election. In the Diet, all opposition parties except the Japanese Communist Party also jointly proposed a motion on July 30th, near the end of the last Diet session, demanding the early dissolution of the House of Representatives. Within the Liberal Party, the group led by former Liberal Party president Ichiro Hatoyama, in an attempt to replace the Yoshida group, repeatedly exerted pressure on the Yoshida group, demanding an early general election. In this predicament of internal and external pressure, the Yoshida government finally issued a statement on August 28th, announcing the early dissolution of the House of Representatives and scheduling a general election for October 1st. Thus, this Diet session was cut short after only two days.

    The Japanese Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party unanimously pointed out that the Yoshida government's early holding of a general election was an admission of failure in the face of public opinion. The Yoshida government in its August 28th statement also had to frankly admit that it had "insisted on completing the term before holding a general election," but now "the trend demanding early dissolution (of the House of Representatives) has reached its extreme, so the government decided to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general election."

    Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, 29th, also acknowledged that the early dissolution of the House of Representatives affected the Yoshida government's measures to promote traitorous and reactionary policies. Kyodo News Agency said: In terms of internal affairs, the "Law for the Suppression of Collective Demonstrations," which was to be submitted to the current Diet session, can no longer be established. In terms of foreign affairs, the so-called "US-Japan Aviation Agreement," the agreement on Japan leasing escort frigates from the United States, and the so-called "United Nations Forces Agreement" which would grant privileges similar to those in the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" to "United Nations Forces" other than the US forces stationed in Japan, all agreements requiring Diet approval, are also affected in many ways.

    Xinhua News Agency, 31st—Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party, the loyal defender of the interests of the Japanese people, is launching a movement to participate in the election struggle.

    As early as January of this year, the Japanese Communist Party issued a "Letter to Compatriots Nationwide for the Upcoming General Election," proposing an anti-imperialist patriotic united election program to all patriotic parties and patriotic people in Japan, including: opposition to the separate treaty and the US-Japan "Security Treaty"; opposition to Japanese rearmament, removal of military bases, and withdrawal of all occupying forces; and the establishment of free, equal, and mutually beneficial trade relations with all countries. The program also called for overthrowing the Liberal Party's traitorous government and establishing a national liberation united government.

    On the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party (July 15th), the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the "Key Points of the Current Struggle," calling on the entire party to take the election struggle as the current urgent task, bravely lead the masses to smash the conspiracies of the US and Japanese reactionaries, expand the strength and organization of the Japanese Communist Party, and use all its strength to unite and develop the entire democratic force.

    After the publication of this statement, the JCP organizations at all levels responded to the call of the Central Guidance Department and are gradually launching election campaigns. The JCP Tokyo Committee held an enlarged meeting of party representatives on August 9th. In addition to the representatives, there were also 700 observers attending the meeting. The conference enthusiastically discussed 21 motions, including "Citizens' demands for the general election" and "Opposition to the militarization of military bases that undermine citizens' lives," and made decisions. The conference unanimously approved the list of JCP candidates participating in the general election as follows: Jiro Hosokawa in the first district of Tokyo, Yashiro Itami in the second district, Hachijiro Kazahaya in the fourth district, Shigeo Aoyagi in the fifth district, and Sukeshi Yoshida in the sixth district. The conference also fully supported Tamesaburo Ameda, a member of the World Peace Council, and Toshiaki Wada of the Socialist Party Reconstruction Faction as joint candidates of the united front.

    The conference also recommended Suzuki, chairman of the JCP Tokyo Committee, as a candidate for the Japanese representative to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The conference also decided to launch a campaign to raise 100 million yen needed to develop the Party's work and demanded the release of all political prisoners imprisoned in Kosuge Prison.

    吉田政府在人民压力下被迫宣布解散众院提前举行大选
    日共号召全党积极参加大选斗争
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：在日本人民的压力下，吉田政府已在八月二十八日宣布提前解散众议院，并订于今年十月一日举行大选。
    日本的现任众议员是在一九四九年一月选出的，任期四年。吉田反动集团就是在那次大选中依靠卑鄙的手段骗取了大多数的选票，继续掌握着政权。自从去年九月间签订旧金山和约以来，吉田政府倒行逆施的罪行变本加厉，并操纵国会通过一系列的违反日本民族利益的条约和法西斯的法案。因此，日本人民和日本各在野党派一致要求吉田政府下台，提前解散国会和举行大选。吉田政府曾经悍然不顾民意，嚣张地一再坚持要“做满任期再行大选”，并且为了强制国会通过各项反人民的法案，将从去年十二月十日召开的第十三次国会会议的法定会期一百五十天，先后延长五次，成为会期长达二百三十五天的空前的“长期国会”，直到今年七月三十一日才闭幕，通过了上百件的违反人民利益的法案。吉田政府甚至还准备在从八月二十六日开始的本次国会会议中提出为加紧重新军国主义化而制订的补充预算和“取缔集体示威法案”以及所谓
    “美日航空协定”等，要求批准。日本人民不能容忍这种情况，他们日益激昂地要求提前大选。在国会中，除日本共产党以外的各在野党也在上次国会将近结束时在七月三十日联合提出了要求提前解散众议院的议案。而在自由党内部，以前自由党总裁鸠山一郎为首的反对吉田茂的集团，为了企图接替吉田集团的地位，也一再对吉田集团行使压力，要求早日举行大选。处在这种内外交迫的窘境之下，吉田政府终于在八月二十八日发表声明，宣布提前解散众议院，并订于十月一日举行大选。这样，这次国会会议仅仅召开两天，就中途夭折了。
    日本共产党和劳农党一致指出：吉田政府提前举行大选是在舆论面前承认失败。吉田政府在它的二十八日的声明也不得不率直承认：它曾经“坚持要做满任期再行大选”，但现在“要求提前解散（众议院）的趋势达到极点，所以政府决定解散众议院，举行大选”。
    共同社东京二十九日电并承认，提前解散众议院影响了吉田政府推行卖国反动政策的措施。共同社说：在内政方面，预备提交本届国会的“取缔集体示威法案”等，现在都已不能成立。在外交方面，所谓“美日航空协定”、关于日本向美国租借护航快舰的协定、对驻日美军以外的“联合国军”也将赋予类似美日“行政协定”中的特权的所谓“联合国军协定”等，都需要国会批准的协定，也在许多方面受到“很大的影响”。
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：日本人民利益的忠诚保卫者——日本共产党正在展开参加大选斗争的运动。
    早在今年一月间，日本共产党就发表了“为即将到来的大选告全国同胞书”，向日本的一切爱国党派、爱国人士提出了反帝国主义爱国统一竞选纲领，内容包括：反对单独和约与美日“安全条约”；反对日本重新武装，撤除军事基地，撤退全部占领军；与一切国家建立自由、平等互惠的贸易关系。纲领并要求打倒自由党卖国政府，建立民族解放联合政府。
    在日共建党三十周年纪念日（七月十五日），日共中央指导部又发表了关于“当前斗争重点”的文告，号召全党把大选斗争作为当前的紧急任务，勇敢地领导群众粉碎美、日反动派的阴谋，扩大日共的力量和组织，用全部力量来团结和发展整个民主力量。
    在这个文告发表之后，日共各级组织响应中央指导部的号召，正在逐渐展开竞选活动。日共东京委员会已在八月九日举行党代表扩大会议。参加会议的除了代表之外，还有旁听者，共计七百人。大会热烈地讨论了“市民对大选的要求”、“反对破坏市民生活的军事基地化”等二十一项议案，并作出决定。大会一致通过参加大选的日共候选人名单如下：东京第一选区细川嘉六、第二选区伊丹弥四郎、第四选区风早八十二、第五选区青柳盛雄、第六选区吉田资治。大会也全力拥护世界和平理事会理事淡德三郎以及社会党再建派的和田敏明为统一战线的共同候选人。
    大会并推荐日共东京委员会主席铃木为日本出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表的候选人。大会又决定展开为发展党的工作所需要的募捐一亿日元运动，并要求释放被囚禁在小菅监狱的全部政治犯。
