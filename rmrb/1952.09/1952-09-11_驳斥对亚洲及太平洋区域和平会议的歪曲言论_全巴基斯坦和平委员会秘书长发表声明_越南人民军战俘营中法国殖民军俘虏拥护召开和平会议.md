Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: Tass, Karachi, September 9th: Shamsul Haq, Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, issued a statement to the press regarding the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. He stated: The All-Pakistan Peace Committee has decided to send a delegation to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Regarding the claim by some newspapers that the Chinese government only invited "certain individuals" to participate in the peace conference, Shamsul Haq refuted this, saying: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference "is a people's conference, convened by the peace committees of various countries to discuss various very important issues, such as: the remilitarization of Japan, the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the declaration of war propaganda and racial hatred as illegal, the development of economic and cultural relations between countries, the peaceful resolution of all wars endangering world peace, especially the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, as this is the main problem currently threatening peace."

    Shamsul Haq urged the people of Pakistan and the people of Eastern countries to do everything possible to ensure the success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, in order to defend peace and the future and happiness of mankind.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: According to the Vietnam News Agency from North Vietnam: French colonial army prisoners in the Vietnamese People's Army POW camps have expressed their support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing, together with the Vietnamese people and the people of the Asian and Pacific Regions.

    All the French colonial army prisoners in the No. 1 POW camp in Vietnam, including two colonels, one major, twenty-two captains, fifty-one lieutenants and second lieutenants, and fifteen sergeants, recently issued a statement expressing their sincere support for the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The statement said: As victims of French colonialists and American interventionists, we are fully aware of the dangers of war. We want to closely unite with the Vietnamese people and fight for the realization of peace in Vietnam; we support the heroic Korean people in resisting the barbaric American imperialists; we want to unite with the Chinese people who sent the People's Volunteers to fight the American aggressors; we deeply admire and respect the people of the Soviet Union, the fortress of world peace; we want to unite with the Japanese people who strongly oppose the American attempt to turn Japan into a military base and arsenal; we want to unite with the French people who are fighting for national independence and an end to the colonial war in Vietnam. We firmly demand that the French government withdraw its colonial troops to achieve peace in Vietnam, and fight for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

    The Peace and Repatriation Committee of the No. 3 POW camp in Vietnam recently wrote a letter to the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace on behalf of all the prisoners of war in the camp, expressing a warm welcome to the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The letter said that we were deceived by the French colonialists and became their tools of war, and committed many crimes against the Vietnamese people. Therefore, we want to condemn the barbarity of the imperialists and fight for the withdrawal of French colonial troops, the cessation of the colonial war in Vietnam, the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, the cessation of the Korean War, and respect for the national sovereignty of the people of the Asian and Pacific Regions.

    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩九日讯：全巴基斯坦和平委员会秘书长山萨姆尔·哈伊就即将举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议向报界发表声明。他说：全巴基斯坦和平委员会已决定派遣代表团参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。对于某些报纸所说中国政府只邀请“某一部分人士”参加和平会议的说法，山萨姆尔·哈伊加以驳斥说：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议“是人民的会议，是由各国和平委员会召开，讨论各种非常重要的问题的，例如：日本的重新军国主义化、禁止原子武器、细菌武器和其他大规模毁灭的武器，宣布战争宣传和种族仇恨为非法，发展各国之间的经济和文化关系，和平解决一切危及世界和平的战争，尤其是和平解决朝鲜问题，因为这是目前威胁和平的主要问题。”
    山萨姆尔·哈伊敦促巴基斯坦人民和东方各国人民竭尽一切力量，保证在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议得到成功，以便保卫和平以及人类的前途和幸福。
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社北越消息：在越南人民军战俘营中的法国殖民军俘虏纷纷表示和越南人民以及亚洲及太平洋区域国家人民一道，拥护即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    在越南第一号战俘营中的所有法国殖民军俘虏，其中包括两个上校、一个少校、二十二个上尉、五十一个中尉、少尉和十五个军士，最近曾发表声明，表示竭诚拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。声明说：作为法国殖民者和美国干涉者的牺牲品的我们，是充分认识到战争的危险的。我们要和越南人民紧密团结，为在越南实现和平而斗争；我们支持英雄的朝鲜人民抵抗野蛮的美帝国主义者；我们要和派遣人民志愿军和美国侵略者作战的中国人民团结在一起；我们深深地赞美和尊敬世界和平堡垒苏联的人民；我们要和极力反对美国企图变日本为军事基地和兵工厂的日本人民团结在一起；我们要和为争取民族独立和结束越南殖民战争而斗争的法国人民团结在一起。我们坚决要求法国政府撤退殖民军以使在越南实现和平，并为和平解决朝鲜问题、缔结五大国和平公约而斗争。
    越南第三号战俘营的和平与遣返委员会最近代表该营全体战俘，写信给越南保卫世界和平委员会，表示热烈欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。这封信说，我们受法国殖民者的欺骗，成为他们的战争工具，曾对越南人民犯下了许多罪行。因此，我们要斥责帝国主义者的野蛮，并为撤退法国殖民军、停止在越南的殖民战争、缔结五大国和平公约、停止朝鲜战争，尊重亚洲及太平洋区域人民的民族主权而斗争。
