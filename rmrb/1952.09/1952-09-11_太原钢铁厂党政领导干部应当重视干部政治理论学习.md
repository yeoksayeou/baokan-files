    Party and Government Leaders of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Should Emphasize Political Theory Study for Cadres

    To the Editor: Some Party and administrative leading comrades in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant do not pay enough attention to the political theory study of cadres currently in service. I believe that with the high tide of economic construction about to arrive, it is impossible for cadres to do a good job in production and construction without a certain level of political theory.

    According to a recent understanding of the situation, the plant's political theory study for cadres can be carried out effectively, and the main problem that should be solved is leadership. For example, in a certain department of the plant, out of 45 cadres in service, apart from a few responsible comrades who are busier, about four-fifths of the cadres can fully participate in regular study systems. The so-called "no time" is just an excuse. Even for responsible cadres, I believe it is entirely possible to squeeze out time for study.

    According to our conversations with twelve cadres in this department, they believe that the reason why study is not effective is mainly due to poor organization and leadership. For example, Comrade Li Xingshan said: "In our group of fourteen people, only seven or eight people regularly attend. People come when they want to, and don't come when they don't want to, and the leaders don't care." When he talked about the content of study, he said: "Since the production competition began, we have been studying the issue of improving product quality, but there is a lack of organization and leadership, and as a result, we haven't learned anything in a month or two." Comrade Wen Jin said: "Study has become a burden! It's really worrying. We just sit there when we go. Some read newspapers, some read books, and some work!" During the study session on August 27th, there were eighteen people in one group, one person was reading a newspaper, one person was calculating wages, one person was looking at drawings (parts drawings), and one person was writing official documents. Three or four people were chatting idly for an hour. The others sat there silently. Please see how serious this situation is! A Party branch committee member said: The current study is: "Politics are lost, and technology is also delayed!" Indeed, if we don't organize well and strengthen leadership, nothing can be learned well.

    Secondly, cadres are also not studying current events enough. On August 24th, we asked eight cadres in the department, and only two of them knew about Premier Zhou's visit to the Soviet Union. That is to say, three-quarters of the cadres, even the responsible comrades of the department, did not know this important news. Even fewer workers knew about it. The Taiyuan Daily published "The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's Plan for Political Theory Study for Cadres" on August 22nd. Up to now (a week later), no research has been conducted on how to implement it specifically. One responsible cadre hasn't even read it. This shows how much they neglect cadre education!

    We hope that the leaders of the plant will pay attention to the study of cadres, and conduct detailed research on all aspects of organization and leadership, theoretical guidance, learning methods, and learning content. Organize the political theory study of cadres in a timely and effective manner to meet the requirements of the current increase production and practice economy movement.

### 太原钢铁厂党政领导干部应当重视干部政治理论学习

    太原钢铁厂党政领导干部应当重视干部政治理论学习
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂有些党的和行政的领导同志，对于在职干部的政治理论学习不够重视。我想，在这经济建设高潮即将到来的时候，干部没有一定的政治理论水平，是不可能搞好生产建设的。
    根据最近我所了解的一点情况，该厂干部政治理论学习是能够搞起来的，主要应该解决领导问题。如该厂某部四十五个在职干部，除少数负责同志工作较忙外，五分之四左右的干部完全可以按照正规的学习制度进行学习，所谓“没有时间”只是一种藉口。就是负责干部我认为也是完全能够挤出学习时间来的。
    据我们和该部十二个干部的谈话，他们认为学习不好的原因，主要是组织领导差。如李兴相同志说：“我们小组十四个人，经常到的只有七、八人，想来就来，不想来就不来，领导也不管。”他谈到学习内容时说：“自生产竞赛以来就学提高产品质量的问题，但缺乏组织领导，结果一两个月也没学习什么东西。”温进同志说：“学习成了负担啦！实在发愁，去了就坐，有的看报，有的看书，有的工作！”八月二十七日学习时，一个小组有十八人，其中一个人看报，一个人算工资，一个人看图（零件图），一个人写公文，一个钟头内有三、四个人闲扯。其他人坐着不啃声。请看这种情况如何严重！一个党支部委员说：现在的学习是：“政治丢啦，技术也误啦！”的确，如果不好好组织，加强领导，什么也学不好。
    其次，干部对于时事学习也很不够，八月二十四日，我们问了该部八个干部，其中只有二人知道周总理等到苏联的事情。就是说四分之三的干部，甚至部的负责同志也不知道这个重大消息。工人中知道的就更少了。八月二十二日太原日报刊登了“中共太原市委的干部政治理论学习计划”，至目前（一周时间）为止，尚未进行研究如何具体执行。有一位负责干部连看都没有看。这说明他们对于干部教育忽视到如何地步！
    我们希望该厂领导方面重视干部的学习，并在组织领导、理论指导、学习方法、学习内容各方面详细研究。把干部政治理论学习及时有效地组织起来，以适应当前增产节约运动的要求。　林俊珍
