Xinhua News Agency, September 25th:

    The Japanese Journalists League issued a letter to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference on September 10th. The full text is as follows:

    All conscientious Japanese journalists extend their warmest respect to the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference—an epoch-making event in Asia's five-thousand-year history.

    We fully support this conference. Although under an occupation system with no freedom of speech, we continue to convey to our Japanese compatriots the great significance of this conference, which concerns the life and death of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions. To further send our own representatives to directly participate in the conference, we are engaged in a fierce struggle with the foolish, conscienceless, and nation-selling Yoshida reactionary government. The struggle is difficult, but we have the support and encouragement of the 80 million Japanese people. The Japanese people, who have suffered from the poison of militarism, deeply feel the preciousness of peace and vow never to allow Asia to be trampled upon again. We will surely win in the struggle to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We are fighting with all our strength for this.

    In the resolution of the World Peace Council's special meeting in Berlin this July, Japan's peace struggle, along with the West German issue and the Korean armistice issue, received the attention of the world. Except for a small handful of traitors, the Japanese people feel that the mission and expectations they bear are significant. Especially after the "May Day" struggle this year, the struggle for peace and national independence has surged to a climax. With the peace forces of Asia and the world guarding us, we are unyielding.

    Under these circumstances, Japanese journalists bear the important task of propaganda. Although the insidious and vicious occupation policy continues to deprive honest journalists of their pens and bread, and narrows the scope of their activities, new democratic newspapers and magazines are emerging one after another, growing with the support of the vast majority of the people.

    Although vicious warmongers have seized the leading positions in large commercial newspapers, their newspapers cannot conceal the unease and wavering of the Japanese ruling class, and within them, conscientious editors are doing their best in arduous struggles. For example, now in cities and villages throughout Japan, people can be seen stopping to watch the collection of atomic bomb photographs posted there, which was published by Asahi Shimbun on the "August 15th" memorial day. This collection of photographs has sold hundreds of thousands of copies, making people more aware of the brutality of the atomic bomb and more filled with hatred for war instigators.

    The "Akahata" (Red Flag) and the progressive "Shakai Jihyo" (Social Times) were the first to resume publication in defiance of illegal suppression, and democratic political newspapers have gained more support from the people; in the magazine field, each issue is filled with the pens of peace warriors. The collections of works by Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung are now the best-selling books in our country; the trade unions, students, and the organs of various democratic organizations have made great contributions to the Japanese peace movement in both quality and quantity.

    We are now doing our utmost to dedicate our loyalty and all our abilities to the success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and to sending national envoys to participate in the conference. Those in power who rule us want to be the "leader of Asia" and order us to go to war with Asia again. However, we will absolutely not go to war. We are determined: we will never let blood stain our pens again. In the current fierce struggle for peace, we journalists must become the journalists of the peace-loving people.

    Long live the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference!

    Mobilize all pens to send envoys of the Japanese people!

    日本记者联盟热烈支持和平会议
    【新华社二十五日讯】日本记者联盟于九月十日发表致亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议书，全文如下：
    凡是有良心的日本记者，都对即将召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议——亚洲五千年历史上划时代的壮举，致以热烈的敬意。
    我们全面支持这个会议，虽然处于言论不自由的占领制度之下，我们还是不断地向日本的同胞传达这个会议的有关亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民生死问题的重大意义。为了进一步派遣我们自己的代表直接参加会议，我们正和昏愚的、丧尽天良的、将国家出卖给美帝国主义的吉田反动政府进行激烈的斗争。斗争是困难的，然而我们得到日本八千万人民大众的支持和鼓励。日本人民曾经遭受军国主义的毒害，深深感到和平的可贵，发誓再也不许践踏亚洲了。我们在争取参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的斗争中，一定会获得胜利。我们正全力为此而斗争着。
    在今年七月世界和平理事会柏林特别会议的决议中，日本的和平斗争同西德问题及朝鲜停战问题，得到全世界关切的注目。除了一小撮的卖国贼以外，日本国民都感到自己所肩负着的使命与期望是重大的，特别是在今年“五一”节斗争以后，争取和平与民族独立的斗争已卷向高潮。有亚洲和世界的和平力量卫护着我们，我们是不屈不挠的。
    在这种情况之下，日本的记者们担负着重要的宣传活动的任务。尽管阴险恶毒的占领政策继续剥夺了正直的记者的笔和面包，缩小了他们的活动范围，然而，疾风知劲草，新的民主报刊杂志还是接踵而出，在绝大多数国民的支持下生长起来。
    毒辣好战的人虽然窃居大商业报社的首要地位，但是他们的报上掩盖不住日本统治阶层的不安和动摇，而在其内部，有良心的编辑们正倾尽心力进行艰苦的斗争。例如，现在在全日本的城市和乡村，到处可以看见人们停步围观张贴在那里的原子弹照片集，这是朝日新闻社在“八·一五”纪念日所发行的。这种照片集已经销售了十几万部，它重使人心更加认识到原子弹的残暴，更加充满了对战争挑拨者的憎恨。
    “赤旗报”和进步的“社会时报”反抗非法镇压而首先复刊了，民主的政治报刊更加获得了国民的支持；杂志界方面，每一期都排列着和平战士们的笔阵。斯大林、毛泽东和金日成的著作集现在成为我国最畅销的书籍；工会、学生和各民主团体的机关报在质和量上都有飞跃的增进，为日本的和平运动做了很大的贡献。
    我们现在正为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成功和派遣国民使节参加会议而竭尽忠诚，献出我们所有的能力。统治我们的权势者想要当“亚洲的盟主”，命令我们再与亚洲为敌去打仗。然而，我们绝对不去打仗。我们下了决心：绝对不让血污再沾染我们的笔。在目前激烈的和平斗争中，我们记者要成为爱好和平的人民的记者。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议万岁！
    为派遣日本国民的使节，将一切的笔杆动员起来！
