    Suggest that the Beijing Municipal People's Court Examine the Handling of the "Shuang He Cheng" Case

    Editor: There are many private businesses such as food shops in our Tsinghua University. These private businesses had signed a contract with our school: "If the school needs the premises, it must give half a month's notice, and (the private businesses) must move out." In June of this year, in order to meet the needs of national construction, our school expanded and urgently needed premises, so we notified the private business "Shuang He Cheng" (which specializes in Western snacks) to move out. The owner of "Shuang He Cheng" used the excuse of owing government taxes and being "unable to repay" to deny the contract. The school then sought the opinion of the Industry and Commerce Section of the Thirteenth District People's Government of Beijing Municipality. The responsible comrade of the Industry and Commerce Section believed that the national construction plan should not be affected because of an illegal private business. The owner of "Shuang He Cheng" has been stubbornly prevaricating, and still did not move out after the deadline. The school then appealed to the Suburban Branch of the Beijing Municipal People's Court stationed in the Thirteenth District for a solution. Two weeks after the appeal, the court had not yet dealt with it. Because the need for premises was urgent, a student from our student union (who was originally a comrade from the school's General Affairs Section responsible for the appeal, but later left school on official business) and the responsible comrade of the Industry and Commerce Section of the Thirteenth District People's Government went to the court to inquire. A person surnamed Pan (or Su) from the court said that Tsinghua University already had an appellant responsible, and others "had no right" to speak. Then he said to that student: "Are you representing the manager? Otherwise, I will not talk to you. I will handle it myself later." A month later, the court announced a verdict, ordering the Tsinghua University Cooperative to buy all the equipment and utensils of "Shuang He Cheng." Why is this? The Tsinghua University Cooperative is not buying junk, and it does not have a sum of money waiting to serve illegal capitalists. The owner of "Shuang He Cheng" has become even more arrogant and rogue-like. This matter has been dragging on until now.

    We want to ask, on what position and with what point of view did the court handle this matter? Now that the national judicial reform movement is being carried out, we hope that the higher-level judicial authorities will examine this case.

    建议北京市人民法院检查“双合成”案的处理情况
    编辑同志：我们清华大学校内有许多食店之类的私商。这些私商曾经和我们学校订过合同：“如学校用房，半月前通知，（私商）即须搬出。”今年六月里，为了适应祖国建设需要，我们学校扩充，急待用房，于是便通知私商“双合成”（专卖西餐零食的）搬出。“双合成”老板以欠政府税款“无法偿还”为辞，不承认合同。校方当向北京市第十三区人民政府工商科征求意见，工商科负责同志认为，不能因为一家违法私商而影响祖国的建设计划。“双合成”老板一直狡赖，限期满后仍然没有搬出。校方便上诉北京市人民法院郊区分院驻第十三区审判庭请求解决。上诉后两个星期，该庭还没有处理。因为用房急迫，我们学生会一同学（原为校方庶务股一同志负责上诉，后因公离校）和第十三区人民政府工商科负责同志去该庭询问。该庭一姓潘（或苏）的表示，清华大学已有上诉人负责，别人“没有权利”再发言。接着他又对那个同学说：“你是代表经理吗？否则我不和你说。以后我自会处理。”过了一个月，该庭宣判了，叫清华大学合作社收买“双合成”的一切设备用具等。这是为什么？清华大学合作社不是收买破烂的，并且也没有那一笔等着为违法资本家服务的资金。“双合成”老板更蛮横无赖起来。这事一直拖到现在。
    我们要问，该审判庭是站在什么立场用什么观点来处理这件事的？现在正当全国开展司法改革运动，希望上级司法部门对此案进行检查。
