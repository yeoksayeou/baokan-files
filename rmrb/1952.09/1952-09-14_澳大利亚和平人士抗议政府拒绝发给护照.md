Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, September 13th, TASS dispatch: Australian newspapers report that the Australian government has decided to refuse to issue passports to delegates attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing. Dr. Bolton, who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in June, said in response to the government's decision: "I deeply regret that neither the Australian government nor the Labor Party abides by the Declaration of Human Rights, which stipulates that citizens of the country can freely enter and leave the country." Reverend Van Eerde, another representative who attended the preparatory meeting, said: "This is shocking news. The Australian delegation, consisting of thirty people, includes people with various political views and religious beliefs. The Australian people are being deprived of the possibility of understanding the truth about the Far East through their representatives."

According to the Melbourne "Century News," Melbourne peace activists held a rally on the 10th, where representatives from Victoria attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference delivered speeches. They said that the main purpose of their trip was to strive for peace in Asia and the Pacific. The representatives also said that during their stay in China, they would study the possibility of trade between Australia and China and become familiar with the lives of the Chinese people. When the Victorian representatives attending the Peace Conference learned of the government's refusal to issue passports, they immediately decided to organize a protest rally and issued a statement saying: As Australian citizens and representatives to the Beijing Peace Conference, we firmly protest the Prime Minister's statement refusing to issue us passports. We will fight against the refusal to issue passports. The Australian people will surely support us. We call on all Australian people to protest against this action by the Federal Government and participate in the protest rally to be held on September 12. James, Secretary of the Australian National Peace Council and one of the representatives to the Peace Conference, said that the government's decision "seriously undermines the fundamental rights of all the people of Australia."

    澳大利亚和平人士抗议政府拒绝发给护照
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社悉尼十一日讯：澳大利亚报纸报道，澳大利亚政府已决定拒绝发护照给参加在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们。曾于六月间参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的博尔顿博士对政府这一决定发表谈话说：“不论是澳大利亚政府或者是工党都不遵守规定本国公民可以自由出入国境的人权宣言，我对此深表遗憾。”参加过筹备会议的另一代表范·伊尔德牧师说：“这是一个骇人听闻的消息。由三十人组成的澳大利亚代表团包括具有各种政治见解和宗教信仰的人。澳大利亚人民被剥夺了经由自己的代表瞭解远东真相的可能性。”
    据墨尔本“世纪报”报道，墨尔本和平人士十日举行了集会，参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的维多利亚州代表们在会上发表了演说。他们说，他们此行的主要目的，是为保障亚洲及太平洋的和平而奋斗。代表们又说，他们在中国的期间，将研究澳大利亚与中国进行贸易的可能性，并熟悉中国人民的生活。当维多利亚州参加和平会议的代表们获悉政府拒发护照的消息后，立即决定组织抗议大会，并发表声明说：我们以澳大利亚公民和北京和平会议代表的身份坚决抗议总理拒绝发给我们护照的声明。我们将为反对拒发护照而斗争。澳大利亚人民必将支持我们。我们号召全体澳大利亚人民抗议联邦政府的这种行动，并参加将于九月十二日举行的抗议大会。和平会议的代表之一、澳大利亚全国和平理事会秘书詹姆斯说，政府的这一决定“严重地破坏了澳大利亚全体人民的基本权利”。
