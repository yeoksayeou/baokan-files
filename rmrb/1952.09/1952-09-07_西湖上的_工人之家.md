    "Workers' Home" on West Lake
    Yu Fang

    In the shady depths near Dingjia Mountain in the inner West Lake of Hangzhou, there is a beautiful large garden. Within the garden are small rivers, ponds, winding paths, and various fruit trees and flowers. Inside the garden are beautiful buildings; the furniture inside the buildings is all precious rosewood. Anyone entering this garden will praise its tranquility and beauty.
    This beautiful large garden is one of the carefully crafted masterpieces of the Chinese working people from half a century ago. It is called Liu Manor. In the past, this was a place for officials of the Manchu Dynasty and reactionary Kuomintang bureaucrats to stroll and enjoy; now, taking a boat from the lakeside and passing through Su Causeway, you can see the large characters "China Railway Workers' Union Sanatorium" on the white walls of Liu Manor from afar. It has become a place for working people to recuperate.
    One day in July, I visited this place. As soon as I entered the garden, I heard moving singing:
    Sing of our beloved motherland,
    From now on moving towards prosperity and strength…
    This was almost lunchtime. The loudspeaker was broadcasting songs that the sanatorium residents loved to listen to.
    Soon, on the garden paths in the shady depths, many people in white pajamas appeared, walking towards the dining hall in groups of three or five, talking and laughing. The dining tables were covered with white tablecloths, and each table had five dishes. I looked at the week's menu on the wall, and no two meals were the same: milk and lard cake for breakfast, sweet and sour fish, braised chicken, and scrambled eggs with tomatoes for lunch and dinner… The staff in the sanatorium arranged everything exceptionally comfortably.
    During nap time, a young girl ran to the director's office. She warmly asked the director for help: she and her hundred-plus companions—female tea factory workers—wanted to invite advanced railway worker elder brothers to give them a report. They had come to Liu Manor to sightsee during their holiday. The request was granted. Three advanced workers gave reports to the female workers. One of them was Chen Fenying, an excellent female train conductor. She said to the tea factory worker sisters: "I am a poor woman who suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society, but the Party made me a train conductor and gave me the honor of coming here to recuperate. Sisters, the Party and Chairman Mao have brought us so much happiness. We must work harder to preserve this happy life and create an even better one…"
    After the nap, the sanatorium residents freely went to the rest room, reading room, or under the shade of the trees to read books and newspapers, play chess, or chat. As you pass through these places, you can always hear their laughter.
    At three-thirty, a delegation from the Northwest minority nationalities came to visit the sanatorium. The staff and residents of the sanatorium warmly welcomed these minority brothers who had come from afar. After the delegation left, the sky became gloomy. Many residents gathered in the spacious room upstairs to play. While they were playing, they chatted about things from the past. A young man picked up the violin on the table amidst everyone's laughter. This young man was Tao Yihang, an excellent teacher from the Nanjing Railway Children's Primary School. He was learning the violin and didn't play very well. But who cared, people only thought: what joyful and happy days! Even if we don't sing well, we must sing to our heart's content. People were intoxicated by the music and singing. The light blue curtains fluttered, and the July evening breeze blew from the lake….
    In the evening, a heavy rain dispersed the heat, and a happy evening party was held in the sanatorium. The party consisted of performances of their favorite programs by the workers and staff of the sanatorium. There was dancing and singing, and the workers laughed like children. When the party ended, people didn't want to sleep yet. Everyone sat at the door of their rooms chatting, talking about the factories they missed, talking about their past and present, talking about their deep gratitude…. After listening to a "White-Haired Girl" interlude, the broadcast sent out a voice urging them to sleep. Everything quieted down, the sanatorium residents all went to sleep, many of them were already dreaming, and the nurses were still going to each room and each bed to see if they had gone to bed on time and whether they had put down their mosquito nets….
    The next morning, I was still asleep when the sanatorium residents got up to do broadcast exercises. They got up at five o'clock. After breakfast, some comrades planned to go boating—the sanatorium had prepared many small boats for the residents. The small boats were tied under the shade of the trees by the lake, waiting for the residents to row them at any time. Some planned to go mountain climbing, some said they wanted to go to the city to buy some Hangzhou specialties….
    This is the life of the sanatorium residents in just one day.
    Liu Manor began to become a railway worker sanatorium in February 1951 and began receiving sanatorium residents in April. In the year and more since, more than 1,300 railway workers have come here to recuperate. They come from various departments under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin, Taiyuan, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Hengyang, and Shanghai Railway Administrations. They are all people who have made outstanding contributions to the restoration and development of China's railway industry and are loved by the masses.
    Wang Yongxiang, a national railway special-class labor model and a 72-year-old worker, came here to recuperate. Before liberation, Wang Yongxiang was an ordinary ironworker in the Changsha Engineering Section. After liberation, he led the ironworker group in the Changsha Engineering Section to create and improve more than 100 large and small tools; because of his loyalty to his work and remarkable achievements, he has been promoted to Deputy Section Chief of the Changsha Engineering Section. Ji Gensheng, the 69-year-old Deputy Director of the Shijiazhuang Tool Factory, came here to recuperate. Ji Gensheng participated in the glorious "February 7th" struggle. At the time of liberation, he actively led the workers to protect the Shijiazhuang Tool Factory; after liberation, he united the masses and actively improved production; now he has become a national railway special-class model. Tian Shixing, a national railway labor model and foreman of the Zhangdian Engineering Section of the Jinan Railway Bureau, who created the "eddy current tamping method," came here to recuperate. Working according to his method can shorten the working hours by one-third, and the quality of work can also be improved. Yu Chunyin, a patrolman at the Shanghai Maigen Road Freight Station who resolutely fought against illegal merchants, came here to recuperate (he is now the Deputy Director of General Affairs of the freight station). After his first recuperation and return to his post, he worked even more actively and waged a heroic struggle against corrupt elements in the "Three-Anti" movement, so he was invited here for recuperation a second time. During his recuperation, many young children went to see him, took his hand, and asked him to tell stories about fighting against illegal elements….
    I will always remember a railway bridge worker named Wang Hanping. During the rule of the reactionaries, he was a cart pusher, a peddler, a "red hat," a despised tramp. Now, he is a skilled worker, a person who has contributed to bridge work. Recently, he was also elected vice chairman of the trade union. He was recommended by the masses to come to the sanatorium for recuperation. I will always remember the look in his eyes as he leaned against the bed, tears glistening, looking at the mountains and lakes outside the window. He spoke touchingly about everything about him. He kept saying: "What kind of person am I, I know myself. Only the Communist Party, only Chairman Mao treat me as a person, only they understand my heart…" He told his companions as if he were swearing: "Even if I die, I will give everything for the Party!"
    Many workers have improved their production efficiency and created new records after returning from the sanatorium. Shen Boguang, the driver of Locomotive 582 of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot, came to Liu Manor for recuperation in April this year. After he returned, he told the whole group everything about the sanatorium. All the comrades in the group were very excited and determined to step up production to defend this happy life. As a result, they created a new national record of 1,244 kilometers per car per day. Xu Ajin, a fitter at the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory, came to Liu Manor for recuperation in April this year. After he returned, he improved the way locomotive light plugs were made, increasing work efficiency 100 times.
    Workers are given physical examinations when they enter and leave the sanatorium. When leaving the sanatorium, everyone gains an average of 1.5 jin in weight, and many gain 2 or 3 jin, except for those who are sick. That day, when I was leaving Liu Manor, the nurses were giving the sanatorium residents physical examinations. Loud and cheerful laughter came from the medical office. Because the pointer on the scale told them: everyone's weight had increased. Du Yiqing, an old patrolman worker from the Shangrao Engineering Section, laughed especially loudly. In five days, he gained five and a half jin. He patted his chest proudly and said: "Chairman Mao told me to gain weight, comrades!"
    Many international friends have visited here. The representatives of the people's democratic countries were happy and excited for us when they saw that we had quickly established workers' sanatoriums. The representatives of those countries still under the enslavement of the imperialists were surprised and envious of our sanatorium.
    A British worker representative said: "Only a country led by the working class would care about the workers like this! We also have workers' sanatoriums in Britain, but they are paid for by the workers themselves. If you go to recuperate for ten days, you will have no wages for ten days; and you have to pay your own recuperation fees!" What the imperialists care about is war profits, they drive workers into the ranks of the unemployed by the thousands and prepare to drive them to the battlefield. "Recuperation" is an irony to workers in imperialist countries!
    International friends from Australia, Cuba, Ceylon, Chile, Argentina, and other countries have also visited here. Li Shuren, a ticket inspector at the Pingxiang Station of the Hengyang Railway Administration, told them about his determination to defend the motherland and defend peace. He said that he was originally from the Northeast. After the Japanese militarists occupied the Northeast, he fled to Guannei to work. But Guannei was also a mess at that time, and the workers had no good days! After liberation, he lived a free and happy life. He told international friends that he loved this happy life and that his heart to defend this happy life was stronger than steel. So when U.S. imperialism extended the flames of war to our border, he encouraged his eldest son to join the Volunteer Army. His eldest son was martyred, and he encouraged his second son to avenge the Korean people and his brother. Li Shuren himself also signed up, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to support the Korean people. The visiting international friends were very moved after listening to Li Shuren's story. They tightly surrounded Li Shuren and expressed their inner excitement with constant handshakes….
    The visit of international friends is an encouragement to the railway workers who are recuperating. The sanatorium residents replied to the international friends: "For the peace and happiness of the people of the world, we must unite with the peace-loving people of the world, work better, fight better, crush the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to expand the war of aggression, and let everyone live a peaceful and happy life!"

### 西湖上的“工人之家”

    西湖上的“工人之家”
    余芳
    在杭州里西湖丁家山附近的林荫深处，有个美丽的大花园。花园内有小河、有池塘、有曲折的小径，有各种果木花卉。花园内有一幢幢漂亮的房屋；房屋内摆设的，全是名贵的红木家具。任何人走进这花园，都要赞美它的幽静和美丽。
    这座美丽的大花园，是我国劳动人民在半世纪以前的精心杰作之一。它叫刘庄。过去这里是满清王朝的官吏和国民党反动官僚徜徉游览之处；现在，从湖滨乘船，穿过苏堤不多久，你老远就可以望见刘庄白墙垣上的“中国铁路工会职工休养所”几个大字。它已成为劳动人民休养的所在了。
    七月里的一天，我访问了这个地方。一走进花园，就听见了动人的歌声：
    歌唱我们亲爱的祖国，
    从今走向繁荣富强……
    这是快吃午饭的时间。扩音器在播送休养员们爱听的歌曲。
    不久，林荫深处的花园小径上，出现了许多穿白色睡衣的人，三三五五、有说有笑地走向饭厅去。餐桌上铺着洁白的桌布，每桌摆着五盆菜。我看了一下墙上的一周菜单，没有一顿菜肴是重复的：早餐牛奶、猪油糕，午餐、晚餐醋溜鱼、红烧鸡、番茄炒蛋……。所内的工作人员将一切都安排得异常舒适。
    午睡时间，一个年青的女孩跑到所长办公室来了。她热情地请所长帮忙：她和她的一百多同伴——茶厂女工们要请先进的铁路工人老大哥给她们作报告。她们是乘着休假日到刘庄来游览的。请求被允许了。三个先进工人给女工们作了报告。其中有一个是优秀的女列车员陈芬英。她对茶厂女工姊妹们说：“我是一个在旧社会里受尽磨折的穷苦女子，但是党让我做了列车员，又使我有到这里来休养的光荣。姊妹们，党和毛主席给我们带来了多么大的幸福呵，我们要更加努力地工作，保住这幸福的日子，创造更美好的日子……”
    午睡以后，休养员们自在地到休息室、阅览室或是树荫下面去看书、看报、下棋、闲谈。你穿过这些地方时，时时可以听到他们的欢笑声。
    三点半钟的时候，西北少数民族参观团到所里来参观了。休养所的工作人员和休养员们热烈地欢迎这些远道来的少数民族兄弟。参观团走后，天阴沉起来。许多休养员就聚在楼上宽敞的房间里玩。他们玩着，闲扯起从前的事来。一个年青人在大家的欢笑声中拿起了桌上的小提琴。这年青人是南京铁路子弟小学的优秀教师陶懿行，他正在学小提琴，拉得并不好。但谁管这些呢，人们只想到：多欢乐多幸福的日子呀！我们唱得不好也要尽情歌唱。人们陶醉在琴声和歌声里。淡蓝色的窗帘飘拂着，湖上吹过来七月的晚风……。
    晚上，一场大雨驱散了热气，休养所里举行了一个快乐的晚会。晚会由工人们和休养所工作人员们共同表演他们所喜爱的节目。有舞蹈，有歌唱，工人们像孩子似地欢笑着。晚会散了，人们还不想睡，大家还坐在房间门口闲谈，谈起他们时时怀念着的工厂，谈起他们的过去和现在，谈起他们深沉的感激……。听了一只“白毛女”插曲后，广播器里送出了催他们入睡的声音。一切都静下去了，休养员们都睡下了，有许多人已经入梦，护士同志们还每个房间每张床铺去看他们是否已按时睡下，是否放下了帐子……。
    第二天一早，我还在睡，休养员们就起来做广播体操了。他们是五点钟就起床的。早饭以后，有的同志打算划船去，——休养所为休养员们准备了许多小船。小船系在湖边树荫下，随时等着休养员们去划。有的打算爬山去，有的说要进城买点杭州的特产……。
    这就是休养员们在短短的一天里的生活。
    刘庄是从一九五一年二月起开始成为铁路职工休养所、四月开始接待休养员的。一年多以来，已有一千三百多名铁路职工到这里来休养过。他们来自天津、太原、济南、郑州、衡阳、上海各铁路管理局所辖的各个部门。他们都是在恢复和发展我国铁路事业中有突出贡献的、为群众所热爱的人物。
    全国铁路特等劳动模范、七十二岁的老工人王永祥到这里来休养过。王永祥在解放前是长沙工务段一个普通的铁工。解放后在长沙工务段领导铁工组创造和改进了一百多件大小工具；由于他对工作的忠诚和卓著的成绩，已被提拔为长沙工务段副段长。石家庄工具场副主任六十九岁老工人计根生到这里来休养过。计根生曾参加过光荣的“二七”斗争。解放时他积极领导工人保护石家庄工具场；解放后又团结群众，积极搞好生产；现在成为全国铁路特等模范。全国铁路劳动模范、创造了“涡流式捣固法”的济南铁路局张店工务段工长田修行到这里来休养过。按照他的工作法进行工作，可以缩短三分之一工时，工作质量也能提高。坚决与不法商人作斗争的上海麦根路货站巡道员、著名的于春银曾到这里来休养过（他现在是该货站副总务主任）。他在第一次休养回到工作岗位上之后，更加积极工作，在“三反”运动中与贪污分子进行了英勇的斗争，所以又第二次被邀到这里来休养。在休养期中，许多少年儿童去看他，拉着他的手，要他讲与不法分子作斗争的故事……。
    我永远记得一个名叫王汉平的铁路桥梁工人。在反动派统治时候，他是推车的，是小贩，是“红帽子”，是遭人鄙视的流浪汉。现在，他是一个有技术的工人，是一个对桥梁工作有贡献的人。最近他还当选了工会副主席。他被群众推选到休养所里来休养。我永远记得他斜倚在床上，眼睛里闪着泪光，望着窗外的群山和湖水的神情。他感动地谈起他的一切。他老是说：“我是怎样一个人呢，我自己明白。只有共产党，只有毛主席才把我当成一个人，才知道我的心……”他宣誓似地告诉他的同伴说：“我就是死，也要为党付出一切！”
    许多工人从休养所回去后都提高了生产效率、创造了新纪录。南京机务段五八二机车司机长沈波光，今年四月份来到刘庄休养。他回去后，把所里的一切告诉全组，全组同志都非常兴奋，决心加紧生产，保卫这种幸福的生活。结果他们创造了一千二百四十四日车公里的全国性新纪录。戚墅堰机厂钳工徐阿金今年四月里来刘庄休养后，他回去改进了机车电灯插头的作法，提高工作效率一百倍。
    工人们进出休养所都要检查身体。离开休养所时，除了有病的以外，每个人平均要增加一市斤半体重，许多人并增加到二、三斤。那天当我离开刘庄时，护士同志们正在给休养员们检查身体。医务室里送来一阵阵宏亮愉快的笑声。因为磅秤上的指针告诉他们：每个人的体重都增加了。上饶工务段老巡道工人杜义庆笑得特别响，五天的时间里，他竟增加了五市斤半，他拍着胸脯骄傲地说：“毛主席叫我长胖的呀，同志们！”
    许多国际友人到这里来参观过。人民民主国家的代表们看见我们很快地建立了工人休养所，为我们感到愉快、兴奋。那些仍在帝国主义者奴役下的国家的代表们，对于我们的休养所感到惊讶、羡慕。
    一位英国工人代表说：“只有工人阶级领导的国家才会这样关心工人！我们英国也有工人休养所，但那是工人自己出钱办的，你去休养十天，就十天没有工资；还要自己付出休养费！”帝国主义者关心的是战争利润，他们成千成万地把工人赶到失业群中去，而且准备把他们驱上战场。“休养”，在帝国主义国家是对工人的讽刺！
    澳大利亚、古巴、锡兰、智利、阿根廷等国的国际友人也曾到这里参观。衡阳铁路管理局萍乡站检票员李树仁向他们讲述了自己保卫祖国，保卫和平的决心。他说，他原来是东北人，日本军国主义者侵占东北后，他逃到关内来做工。但那时关内也一样乱糟糟，那有工人的好日子！解放后，他才过着自由、愉快的生活。他告诉国际友人们，他热爱这幸福的日子，他要保卫这幸福日子的心比钢铁还要坚强。所以当美帝国主义把战火延烧到我国边境时，他就鼓励大儿子去参加志愿军。大儿子牺牲了，他又鼓励第二个儿子去为朝鲜人民、为哥哥报仇。李树仁自己也报了名，准备随时响应祖国的号召去支援朝鲜人民。来访的国际友人听了李树仁的讲述都非常感动。他们紧紧地把李树仁围起来，用不断的握手表达他们内心的激动……。
    国际友人的访问对于在休养中的铁路工人是一种鼓舞。休养员们回答国际友人说：“为了全世界人民的和平幸福，我们要和全世界爱好和平的人民团结在一起，更好地劳动，更好地斗争，粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，让大家都能过和平幸福的生活！”
