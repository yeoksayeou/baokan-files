The American Invaders in Korea Cannot Solve Their Problem

Li Gao

Almost every few days, American generals have to boast about the combat effectiveness and morale of the American invading forces in Korea. Van Fleet, who is supervising the war in Korea, is especially diligent in his bragging.

Healthy people don't often talk incessantly about their bodies; only those with a headache like to talk about their head, and those with a foot ache like to talk about their feet. The more Van Fleet and his ilk boast about the morale of the American troops, the more it shows that this issue is greatly troubling them.

A little over two months ago, the Associated Press had this plaintive description: "The Korean War has been going on for two years, and peace is still nowhere in sight. Fierce, deadlocked battles continue on lonely hilltops. The armistice talks are bogged down in a chaotic stalemate. Weary American GIs are only hoping for rotation. Even the generals are rotating..." "Weary" and "only wanting to go home" - this is the "high" morale that Van Fleet and his ilk are boasting about.

Around the time the Associated Press wrote this news, two division commanders of the American invading forces in Korea gave up being generals and went home to do business. Major General Hodeson, commander of the 40th Division, went back to become the manager of an oil company. This American general, like a frightened bird, was still wary even after sitting behind his counter. He repeatedly stated that the American invasion of Korea had no chance of success, complaining that "the average American soldier doesn't pride himself on winning battles, but only wants to get enough points to go home," and he believed that "the Communists can drive the United Nations forces out of Korea whenever they decide to attack." The U.S. Army Department threatened him, trying to force him to change his tune and say a few auspicious words, but he said, "My opinion is based directly on the facts on the front lines" (June 9th, 10th Associated Press, July 11th National News Agency reports). Another one who abandoned his post was Major General Stilwell, commander of the 45th Division. He returned to Oklahoma and became a cotton broker. This general, who had been defeated on the Korean battlefield, returned home and vented his anger, blaming heaven and earth. On August 5th, he said in a speech at the Oklahoma American Legion convention: "We are not only losing face in Korea, but also losing face all over the world." He vehemently criticized his superiors, saying, "The reason we are so bad is that there are too many idealists and nice guys among the decision-makers in the government... It's okay if your head is in the clouds and your feet are on the ground, but many decision-makers in Washington are hanging entirely in the air." (August 5th Associated Press)

It would be easy to handle if only a few American division commanders gave up their posts and went home to vent their anger, because it is not difficult to find a few adventurers in the United States who want to go to Korea to get promoted and make a fortune; the Pentagon's biggest headache is that the vast majority of American soldiers are unwilling to go to Korea to die, which makes those "idealists" who are constantly dreaming of annexing Korea and expanding the war truly "hanging entirely in the air." According to a "San Francisco Chronicle" reporter from the Stoneman military camp in California: At least one hundred soldiers there each month deliberately cause incidents - they damage cars parked on the roadside, break glass near the police station, get themselves arrested and imprisoned in non-military prisons to avoid being sent to Korea. The local prisons are already full of soldiers.

The number of American airmen who escape going to the front lines is no less than that of the army. In mid-April, the "New York American" revealed a "mutiny" incident at the Lanier Field Air Force Base involving American pilots who were unwilling to participate in the Korean War. A few days later, "U.S. News & World Report" revealed that a large number of American air force personnel were "requesting to be relieved of flight duties... Those who do not get approval sometimes develop into problematic incidents." The Biggs Air Force Base in Texas, the Randolph Air Force Base, and the Mather Air Force Base in California have all been experiencing a continuous stream of "betrayal" incidents. New York's "Outlook" magazine said in late August that the tendency of American youth to fear flying is getting worse day by day. At the Pensacola Naval Air Station, 54 percent of the students were eliminated last year because of "fear of flying." Even the students at West Point, America's premier cannon fodder factory, are unwilling to join the Air Force. For the first time, the school failed to complete its mission of sending a quarter of its graduates to the Air Force.

The extent to which the morale of the American troops on the Korean battlefield has fallen is rarely revealed because the Clark headquarters "has implemented even stricter security regulations than when Ridgway was commander" (Associated Press), but sometimes a little bit inevitably leaks out. A letter from an American officer from the Eighth Army Reserve Area, published in "U.S. News & World Report" on August 8th, said: "Every night when the phone rings, we feel cold all over because we are afraid we may have to go on a counterattack." Another letter from the front line said: "We lose about a hundred grenades every night - the brothers just throw grenades wherever they hear a sound." This vividly portrays a scene of extreme nervousness and suspicion. On September 9th, the Associated Press reported a very interesting story: Three tank drivers from the American Second Division in Korea were scheduled to rotate home the next day, but their return route was blocked by rising river waters. However, they "refused to wait another day" and jumped into the 25-foot-deep, 30-40-yard-wide rapids and swam across. - They would rather risk drowning than spend another moment on the Korean battlefield. One can imagine how "high" the morale of the American invading forces in Korea is!

American generals have indeed racked their brains and thought of many "good methods" and "brilliant plans" to save their declining morale. The cheapest method is of course just to talk. It is said that flattery plus deception can sometimes make a dying patient jump out of bed. Therefore, Van Fleet and his ilk have worked very hard in this regard. But the effect is not as good as Van Fleet and his ilk imagined. Despite their boasting about the American troops' "strong combat power" and "high morale," even their division commanders, Hodeson and Stilwell, didn't believe them.

Another method is rotation. According to Reuters, this system is considered by many American commanders to be "the only good way to encourage frontline troops to endure frontline life." However, this method ties up more American forces in the Korean War and causes more Americans to panic and become dissatisfied. The Associated Press reported on August 2nd: "The one millionth conscript has already served. This war thousands of miles away consumes more lives and affects more American families month after month... Ordinary people ask themselves: 'Why are we fighting in Korea?' He may find it difficult to find an answer." Will the morale really improve by replacing a batch of soldiers who don't know why they are fighting in Korea with another batch of soldiers who don't know why they are fighting in Korea? A Reuters reporter answered this question: "Morale sometimes declines because the rotation is delayed, and sometimes declines because the rotation is faster." That is to say, no matter how you rotate, the morale is still low.

Wall Street bosses are very familiar with the method of using beef to lure dogs, so they also used canned food and banknotes in their prescription for treating the morale sickness of the American invading forces in Korea. Not long ago, Reuters proclaimed that the American invading forces in Korea have seen "great improvements in the two major elements of boosting morale - food and mail delivery - compared to the last world war" (but it dared not reveal the situation of the Lee pseudo-army having "three handfuls of rice a day and seven small scallions a week"). In early September, the Associated Press once again touted the American invading forces in Korea distributing "combat allowances," listing many categories of such allowances: "incentive allowances," "hazardous duty allowances," and allowances for "encountering Communist fire or explosions," etc. It is said that 40,000 American soldiers received more than 8.3 million US dollars in this life-selling money this time. The average life of an American soldier is originally only worth two hundred dollars. What a fair price!

However, even two hundred dollars or "greatly improved" food does not seem to make the American soldiers unafraid of death, so the American invading forces in Korea have to come up with another brilliant plan. They want to find something like an "amulet" from ancient mythology to trick American soldiers into blindly rushing into the fire to die without fear. Since this spring, American news agencies have been sending news to comfort their soldiers, saying that the United States has invented a "nylon bulletproof vest" that can "greatly reduce the number of combat casualties." American generals also earnestly admonish their soldiers to trust this "armor," just like witches persuading patients to wear "spiritual charms." However, this "armor" is penetrated by a single shot, and the bullets that pass through it can still penetrate more than an inch into trees. The First Marine Division of the United States tried this "magic weapon," and the division has lost more than 3,000 people since the end of March this year. This is a bit like the story of the Ugo Kingdom heroes in the old Chinese novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." If the American soldiers knew the fate of the "30,000 rattan armor soldiers," they would definitely tremble with fear again.

When all kinds of methods have been exhausted and the declining morale of the American invading forces in Korea still cannot be saved, American generals often miss the "fanaticism" of American soldiers in World War II, and their words are full of sadness and emotion, unable to bear the feeling of the past and present. A "senior American officer" said angrily: "Our society is beginning to encounter demons." (August 26th Reuters) Yes, to drive tens of thousands of American soldiers to a place thousands of miles away to sell their lives for the war profits of a few Wall Street people, even if American generals come up with a thousand more brilliant plans, this "demon" of demoralization cannot be driven away.

    侵朝美军无法解决的难题
    李高
    美国将军们差不多每隔几天就要吹一吹侵朝美军的作战力和士气。在朝鲜督战的范佛里特尤其吹得勤。
    健康的人是不会时常啰啰嗦嗦谈自己的身体的；只有头痛的人喜欢谈头，脚痛的人喜欢谈脚。范佛里特们对美军士气吹得越勤，正说明这个问题大大地伤了他们的脑筋。
    两个多月前，美联社有这样一段如怨如诉的描写：“朝鲜战争已经进行了两年，和平仍然遥遥无期。激烈的、相持不下的战斗在一个个孤独的山头上持续着。停战谈判陷入了吵成一团的僵局。疲惫的美国大兵们一心只希望轮换。甚至将领都轮换。……”“疲惫”和“一心只想回家”，这就是范佛里特们所吹嘘的“高昂”的士气。
    正在美联社写这条新闻的前后，侵朝美军的两个师长丢掉将军不干回国做买卖去了。第四十师师长胡德逊少将回去做了一家石油公司的经理。这个如惊弓之鸟的美国将军坐到了他的柜台后边还是心有余悸。他一再声明美国侵朝战争没有什么打头了，他埋怨“通常的一个美国兵不是以打胜仗为荣，而是一心只想搞得足够的分数可以回家”，他认为“共军什么时候决定进攻，就什么时候都能把联合国军队赶出朝鲜”。美国陆军部吓唬他，想逼着他改改口说几句吉利话，可是他说：“我的意见是直接以前线上的事实为依据的”（六月九日、十日合众社、七月十一日国新社报道）。另一个丢盔卸甲的是四十五师师长史蒂朗少将。他回到俄克拉何马做了棉花掮客。这个在朝鲜战场上吃了败仗的将军回国后大发虚火，怨天恨地。八月五日，他在俄克拉何马美国退伍军人团会议上演讲时说：“我们不仅在朝鲜丢脸，而且在全世界丢脸。”他痛骂他的上司道：“我们如此糟糕的原因是在政府的决策者中的空想家和好好先生太多了。……如果你的头在云中，脚踏在地上，这倒没有关系，但是华盛顿的许多决策者却全身都吊在空中。”（八月五日美联社讯）
    光只几个美国师长丢官不干，回国动动肝火，事情倒容易办，因为在美国找几个接替他们的想到朝鲜升官发财的冒险家目前还不困难；五角大楼最伤脑筋的还是广大美国士兵不愿到朝鲜去送死，这就使那些时刻做着并吞朝鲜、扩大战争之梦的“空想家”们真的“全身都吊在空中”了。据“旧金山纪事报”记者从美国加利福尼亚州的斯东曼军营报道说：那儿每月至少有一百名士兵故意造成事件——他们毁坏停在道旁的汽车，打破警察局附近的玻璃，让自己被捕并被关在非军事监狱里，以避免被派到朝鲜去。地方监狱里已充满了士兵。
    美国空军逃避上前线的也不比陆军少。四月中旬，“纽约美国人报”透露了一次兰尼尔弗·菲尔姆空军基地美国飞行员因为不愿参加朝鲜战争而发生的“哗变”事件。隔了几天，“美国新闻与世界报道”又透露大批美国空军人员“正在请求解除飞行职务。……那些得不到批准的，有时就发展为成问题的事件”，得克萨斯州的碧格斯空军基地、伦道尔夫空军基地和加利福尼亚州的马特空军基地，都接连不断地发生“背叛”事件。纽约“展望”杂志在八月下旬说，美国青年害怕飞行的倾向正一天比一天厉害。在海军的潘萨科拉飞机场，去年有百分之五十四的学员因为“害怕飞行”被淘汰了。连美国的高级炮灰制造所——西点军校——的学员，也不愿当空军。这个学校第一次没有完成它的把四分之一毕业生送去当空军的任务。
    朝鲜战地美军士气究竟低落到了什么程度，因为克拉克总部“已实行远较李奇微任司令时更为严格的保密规定”（合众社语），很少透露出来，不过有时也难免漏出一点。八月八日“美国新闻与世界报道”刊载的一个美国军官从第八军后备区发出的一封信里说：“夜间每当电话铃一响，我们就浑身发冷，因为害怕我们可能要去反攻。”另一封寄自前线的信里说：“我们每一夜损失百来个手榴弹——弟兄们直把手榴弹往有声的地方掷去。”这真是活画出了风声鹤唳、草木皆兵的情景。九月九日合众社报道了一个很有趣的故事：侵朝美军第二师的三个坦克车手第二天要轮换回国，归路被附近河流涨水阻住了，可是他们“不肯再多等一天”，就跳进二十五呎深，三、四十码宽的急流里游了过去。——宁愿冒淹死的危险也不愿在朝鲜战场上多耽一刻，侵朝美军的士气之“高”可以想见了！
    美国将军们为了挽救颓败的士气，的确挖空心思想了许多“良方”“妙计”。最廉价的办法当然是只动动嘴巴。据说，奉承加欺骗，有时能使一个垂死的病人跃然起床的。所以，范佛里特们在这方面做得很卖力。但效果不如范佛里特们所想像的那么好。尽管他们把美军的“强大作战力”和“高昂士气”吹得天花乱坠，可是就连他们手边的师长胡德逊和史蒂朗都不信他们这一套。
    另一个办法是轮换。据路透社说，这个制度被许多美国指挥官认为是“鼓励前线军队忍受前线生活的唯一的好办法”。可是这个办法把更多的美国兵力牵掣在朝鲜战争中，而且引起了更多的美国人的恐慌和不满。美联社在八月二日报道说：“第一百万个应征的兵士已经在服役了。这个万里之外的战争一个月比一个月耗费更多的生命，影响更多的美国家庭。……普通的人都扪心自问：‘我们究竟为什么在朝鲜作战呢？’他可能很难找到一个回答。”这样把一批不知道为什么要在朝鲜作战的士兵换上另一批不知道为什么要在朝鲜作战的士兵，士气真的就会高起来吗？路透社记者回答了这个问题：“士气有时因轮换迟不进行而低落，有时因轮换比较快而低落。”就是说，换来换去，还是一个士气低落。
    华尔街老板们很熟悉用牛肉诱狗的办法，所以他们医治侵朝美军士气病的药方里也用了罐头和美钞。不久以前，路透社宣扬道：侵朝美军“提高士气的两大要素——食物和邮件运送的工作比起上次大战来已大有改进”（不过它不敢透露李伪军“一天三把米，一星期发七棵小葱”的情况）。美联社九月初又把侵朝美军发放“作战津贴”的事渲染了一番，它列举了这种津贴的许多名色：“鼓励性津贴”、“危险任务津贴”、“遇到共军的射击或爆炸”的津贴等等。据说，这次有四万美国军人一共领到这种卖命钱八百三十多万美元。平均一条美国兵的性命原来只值二百美元。好公道的价钱！
    不过二百美元也好，“大有改进”的食物也好，似乎都不能叫美国大兵不怕死，所以侵朝美军不得不另出妙计。他们想找一种古代神话里的“护身符”似的东西，骗得美国士兵不知恐惧地盲目地冲到炮火底下去送死。今年春天以来，美国通讯社发出消息安慰他们的士兵说：美国已经发明了一种可以“大大减少作战伤亡数字”的“尼龙避弹衣”。美国将军们也像巫师劝病人带“灵符”一样谆谆地告诫他们的士兵信赖这种“铠甲”。可是这种“铠甲”一枪就被打穿，穿过它的枪弹还能打进树木一寸多深。美国海军陆战队第一师试用了这个“法宝”，这个师从今年三月底以来损失了三千多人。这有点像中国旧小说“三国演义”中乌戈国英雄们的故事。美国大兵们如果知道了“三万藤甲兵”的命运，一定又会吓得发起抖来。
    在想尽了种种办法仍不能挽救侵朝美军颓废的士气的时候，美国将军们常常怀念第二次世界大战中美国士兵的“狂热”，言下凄凉感慨，不胜今昔之感。一个“美国高级军官”愤愤地说：“我们的社会开始遇到了魔鬼。”（八月二十六日路透社讯）是的，要驱使成千成万的美国士兵到万里之外去为华尔街少数几个人的战争利润卖命，纵使美国将军们再想出一千条妙计，这个士气不振的“魔鬼”也是赶不走的。
