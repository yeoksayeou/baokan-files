    Do Not Allow U.S. Imperialism to Launch Wars
    Labor Model Wang Dechun
    I am a worker constructing the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. We are working hard to change the face of the transportation-isolated Northwest Plateau. The railway from Tianshui to Lanzhou is 347 kilometers long. It runs through many high mountains and ridges, crossing the Bitter Water River, Salty Water River, Clear Water River, and countless transverse deep ravines. We build roads through mountains and bridges over rivers. We have cleaved countless hard rocks. We have built solid roadbeds on unstable quicksand formations. In many sections, the work is very difficult. We are as tense as on a battlefield when dealing with collapsing earthworks. However, our mood is very happy. Every time we hear the sound of artillery and a mountain top is blasted open, we deeply feel that we have contributed to human peace and a happy life.

    This feeling encourages us to overcome countless difficulties. Some places along the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway are still very desolate. In the Longxi and Dingxi areas, the groundwater near the railway is bitter and astringent, undrinkable, and causes diarrhea if you drink it. Local residents use窖藏 rainwater. Our railway workers often have to change construction sites and do not have time to dig cellars to store water, so they have to travel dozens of miles to transport water, which incurs large transportation costs. To save transportation costs, many co-workers look everywhere for better-tasting water to drink. In this way, we saved the people more than 1 billion yuan in transportation costs. The climate on the Northwest Plateau varies greatly, sometimes as cold as minus 20 degrees Celsius. The co-workers live in tents, but instead of thinking about how to keep warm, everyone thinks about how to speed up the progress of the project and how to ensure the quality of the project. For example, the co-workers who poured concrete adopted the method of mixing cement with hot water. Then everyone covered the poured concrete with dry grass to prevent it from freezing. This allows concrete projects to be done in winter. Another example is our wooden bridge engineering team, which constantly learns advanced working methods in its work. Our work efficiency has generally more than doubled. When building bridges in the sixth engineering section, we completed in one month what used to take three months.

    Because all the comrades on the line worked so selflessly, we completed this railway in one year and twenty-three days ahead of schedule. It will officially open to traffic this National Day. Watching the abundant minerals and fur goods on the Northwest Plateau flow out from here, to Tianshui, to Xi'an, and to all of China. And the cloth, daily necessities, and other items that the people on the plateau lack will also flow in from here in an endless stream. Our peaceful labor creates happiness for millions of people, and we feel how happy we are too!

    But when we think of U.S. imperialism, we become very angry. We use explosives here to open mountains, but they use explosives in Korea to destroy peaceful cities and villages and slaughter the people there. We cannot but resolutely oppose its heinous crimes. We want peace, not war!

    Recently, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be held in Beijing, and we fully support this conference. Please tell the people of Asia and the Pacific regions after the delegates return home: the workers on the remote Northwest Plateau of China are determined to unite with them and fight together against U.S. imperialism, and not allow it to launch wars!

### 不许美帝国主义发动战争

    不许美帝国主义发动战争
    劳动模范　王德纯
    我是修筑天兰铁路的一个工人。我们正在努力改变交通闭塞的西北高原的面貌。从天水到兰州的铁路全长三百四十七公里。沿线穿过许多崇山峻岭，跨过苦水河、咸水河、清水河以及无数条横亘的深沟。我们逢山开山，遇水搭桥。我们劈开了无数坚硬的岩石。我们在不稳固的流砂地层上筑成坚实的路基。在许多地段上，做工是很困难的。对待上崩下塌的土方，我们像在战场上一样紧张。可是，我们的心情十分愉快。每当我们听到炮声一响，一个山头被轰开了的时候，我们就深切地感到，我们又为人类和平、幸福的生活尽了一分力量。
    这种心情鼓舞着我们克服了无数困难。天兰路沿线有些地方现在还是很荒凉的。在陇西、定西一带，铁路附近的地下水又苦又涩，不能入口，喝一点就要拉肚子。当地居民用的是窖藏的雨水。我们铁路工人时常要变换工地，来不及挖窖储水，要跑到几十里之外运水，运费的开支是很大的。为了节省运费，许多工友到处找味道比较好一点的水饮用。就这样，我们为人民节省了十亿元以上的运费。西北高原上的气候变化很大，有时冷到摄氏零下二十度。工友们住的是帐篷，可是大家不是想自己怎样御寒，而只想到如何加速工程的进行，如何保证工程的质量。比如，打混凝土的工友采用了烧热水拌洋灰的办法。然后大家把打好的混凝土用干草包盖，以免冻坏。这样使混凝土工程在冬天也能做。又如我们木桥工程队，在工作中不断地学习先进工作方法。我们的工作效率普遍提高了一倍以上。在第六工程段架桥的时候，我们一个月完成了过去需要三个月才能完成的任务。
    因为全路同志们这样忘我地劳动，我们在一年零二十三天内，提前把这条铁路修成了。今年国庆节就要正式通车。眼看着西北高原上丰富的矿产以及皮毛等货物，就要从这儿流出去，流到天水，流到西安，流向全中国。而高原上人民所缺少的布匹、日用品等，也将从这儿源源不绝地流进来。我们的和平劳动为千万人创造了幸福，我们感到自己也是多么幸福啊！
    但是，当我们一想到美帝国主义的时候，我们就非常愤怒。我们在这儿用炸药开山，他们却用炸药在朝鲜炸毁和平城市和乡村，屠杀那儿的人民。我们不能不坚决反对它的滔天罪行。我们要和平，不要战争！
    最近，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议要在北京举行，我们十分拥护这个会议。请各国的代表们回去以后告诉亚洲及太平洋区域的全体人民：在遥远的中国西北高原上的工人们决心和他们团结在一起，共同向美帝国主义斗争，不许它发动战争！
