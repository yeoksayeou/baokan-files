    Chongqing's Public and Private Enterprises Store Large Quantities of Goods to Welcome the Peak Commercial Season After Autumn
    Since the beginning of autumn, merchants from Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and other provinces have been coming to Chongqing to purchase goods in increasing numbers. To welcome the peak commercial season after autumn, Chongqing's public and private businesses and cooperatives are storing large quantities of goods to ensure market supply. The Chongqing Department Store's procurement volume for this autumn and winter is more than double that of the same period last year. The Chongqing Cooperatives Federation is currently revising its original procurement plan and dispatching personnel to Shanghai and other places to purchase goods, while also stepping up the construction of warehouses to store large quantities of goods. Private department stores ordered goods worth over 310 billion yuan from state-owned trading companies at the Southwest China Materials Exchange Conference, and have now fulfilled the transaction contracts and begun to receive goods. Many private industrial and commercial enterprises are also preparing to expand their operations.

    State-Owned Trading Company of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region Transfers Goods to Prepare for Large-Scale Supply of Necessities for Tibetan People After Autumn
    The State-Owned Trading Company of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region is currently expanding its organization and actively transferring goods in preparation for large-scale supply of necessities for the Tibetan people after autumn. Currently, the state-owned trading company in the region has established trade branches in six counties including Houqu in the pastoral areas, and has dispatched five mobile teams to go deep into rural areas and pastures, extending as far as Dege on the east bank of the Jinsha River. To ensure timely supply of materials, the company signed a transportation contract with the Joint Transport Company in early August. As of now, the total amount of tea, salt, and sugar transported to Ganzi, Dege, Daofu, and other five counties in the northern part of the region is about 200 tons. Nearly a thousand pack animals (120 jin per pack) have transported goods to remote rural areas. At the same time, the company has dispatched special personnel to Sichuan to purchase and customize butter tea churns and other goods, and has ordered 20,000 sets of various agricultural tools in Ya'an for farmers' needs in autumn harvest and autumn plowing.

    Private Minsheng Industrial Co., Ltd. Transformed into a Joint State-Private Enterprise
    The private Minsheng Industrial Co., Ltd., which operates Yangtze River shipping, was transformed into a joint state-private enterprise on September 1st. The head office has also decided to move from Chongqing to Hankou in order to implement a unified transportation plan under the leadership of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration. Minsheng Company has a history of more than 20 years and was originally the largest private shipping company in China, with more than 43,000 tons of ships, occupying an important position in Yangtze River shipping. However, due to the company's poor management policies and systems, its production efficiency was low, and it suffered great losses. After liberation, the People's Government provided various forms of support to help it improve its operations, and recently its business has gradually developed.
