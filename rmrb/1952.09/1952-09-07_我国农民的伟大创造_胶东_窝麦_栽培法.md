The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

    The "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method is a method of cultivating wheat in paddy fields created by farmers in Yexian County, Shandong Province. Wheat cultivated using this method generally yields four to five hundred catties per mu, and in some cases, more than six to seven hundred catties per mu. In order to summarize and promote this advanced agricultural science and technology experience created by Chinese farmers, our Ministry sent personnel to Yexian County twice in the autumn of 1951 to conduct on-the-spot investigations, and in early 1952, invited experienced labor models in planting "Wowo Wheat" to the Ministry for discussions. To further understand the growth of "Wowo Wheat" and cultivation experience, our Ministry sent personnel to reside in the area for on-the-spot observations during the wheat growth period this year (May to July). The results of the two-year investigation are now compiled and published.

    I. The History of “Wowo Wheat”

    "Wowo Wheat" is a method of cultivating wheat in paddy fields created by farmers in Yexian County, Jiaodong. When planting wheat, seeds are sown evenly in wide ditches that have been irrigated, fertilized, and carefully prepared. Because the wheat seedlings seem to grow in manure-filled "wowo" (depressions), local farmers call it "Wowo Wheat" (and because it is sown in ditches, farmers in Tai'an and Laiwu call it "Ditch Wheat"). It is impossible to ascertain exactly when this cultivation method originated. Wang Zhaoxing, an 84-year-old local farmer, said that when he was young, there was little land for many people in the area (averaging about one mu per person). In order to make the most of the land, one farmer initially plowed up the threshing ground after the autumn harvest, opened ditches, and planted barley. He felt that the season was already late, so he sowed more seeds, applied more fertilizer, and watered more, and the harvest was greater than that of barley planted using ordinary methods. The following year, six farmers adopted his method, and the grain harvest was also very large. Since then, this wheat planting method has gradually spread, from threshing grounds and gardens to large fields, from Wowo barley to Wowo wheat, and the method has been gradually improved, slowly developing into a more complete set of cultivation methods.

    The yield of wheat planted using this method is very high. However, because this cultivation method requires conditions such as abundant fertilizer, sufficient water, and good varieties, ordinary poor farmers could not generally adopt it during the rule of the reactionary government. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, in Lijiacun, Baowang District, Yexian County, where the most Wowo wheat was planted, Wowo wheat farmers accounted for only 15 to 16 percent of wheat farmers. After liberation, the lives of local farmers have improved, their enthusiasm for production has increased, and production investment has increased significantly. The Wowo wheat method has developed rapidly. At present, farmers in Xizhang, Guoxi, Baowang, and coastal areas of Yexian County are widely planting Wowo wheat. In the plains of Xizhang District, the area planted with Wowo wheat has reached 20 percent of the cultivated land area, and in hilly areas it has reached 10 percent. In 1950, Houlu Village, Guoxi District, only planted 20 mu of Wowo wheat, but in 1951 it expanded to 64 mu, an increase of more than two times. At present, in Shandong Province, in addition to Yexian County, many farmers in the suburbs of Jinan, Weixian County, Tai'an, and Laiwu are also planting Wowo wheat. The Wowo wheat cultivation method is being rapidly disseminated and promoted.

    II. The Benefits of Planting “Wowo Wheat”

    Compared with ordinary Lou wheat (wheat planted with a seed drill), "Wowo Wheat" has many advantages:

    (1) High and stable yield: High yield is the most significant feature of "Wowo Wheat." In Yexian County, the yield of wheat planted by farmers using a seed drill is usually only 100 to 200 catties per mu, and at most 300 catties; wheat planted using the "Wowo Wheat" method can generally yield 400 to 500 catties, and in some cases, 600 to 700 catties. The following table compares the yield of "Wowo Wheat" and Lou wheat for several farmers in Yexian County in 1951: (Attached chart)

    (2) Can ensure a bumper harvest of two crops a year: Local paddy fields generally practice a two-crop-a-year rotation of corn and wheat. However, sometimes the autumn corn harvest is late, and it is often too late to plant wheat. The sowing period of "Wowo Wheat" is half a month later than that of Lou wheat, so wheat can still be planted using the "Wowo Wheat" method after the autumn harvest. Because there is more time, there is also time for careful cultivation to restore soil fertility, thus ensuring a bumper harvest of two crops. Chen Xingbang is a skilled Wowo wheat planter. In 1951, his wheat yielded 634 catties per mu, and his previous corn crop yielded 560 catties per mu. Planting one mu of "Wowo Wheat" requires more labor than planting one mu of Lou wheat, but the universal wheat planting and harvesting time is during the busiest season for farmers, while the sowing period of "Wowo Wheat" is half a month later than that of Lou wheat, and the harvest is also two or three days later, so labor can be appropriately adjusted.

    (3) Large economic benefits: The yield of "Wowo Wheat" is high, and it also produces more wheat straw. Ordinary mu of "Wowo Wheat" produces twice as much wheat straw as Lou wheat, and the amount of wheat stalks that can be used for making straw braid is one-half more. Jiaodong is a straw braid producing area, and planting "Wowo Wheat" can fully supply the raw materials for this sideline. Therefore, although planting Wowo wheat requires more labor and fertilizer, the increased income far exceeds the cost. According to statistics, the income from wheat straw and wheat stalks (which can be used for making straw braid) alone can offset the value of the extra fertilizer applied. The following table compares the income of Chen Xingbang's "Wowo Wheat" and his neighbor Chen Xiude's Lou wheat: (Attached chart)

    Note: 1. Calculated based on the price of 950 yuan per catty of wheat in 1950; 2. Bean cake is calculated at 750 yuan per catty; 3. Barnyard manure is calculated at 30 catties equivalent to 1 catty of bean cake; 4. Fertilizer powder is calculated at 1,700 yuan per catty; 5. Labor is calculated at 12,000 yuan per person; 6. Wheat straw is calculated at 70 yuan per catty; 7. Wheat stalks (for making straw braid) are calculated at 250 yuan per catty.

    III. The Cultivation Method of “Wowo Wheat”

    After the corn harvest before the Autumn Equinox, immediately carry out the first deep plowing, starting from both sides of the field, turning the soil outward to a depth of six or seven inches. After plowing, harrow and rake each once. Then spread soil manure, 1,500 to 5,000 catties per mu, and carry out the second plowing, starting from the middle of the field, turning the soil inward, so that the middle seam is tightly closed. After plowing, harrow and rake each once again. After such plowing and harrowing, the soil layer is deep and loose, the fertilizer is evenly mixed, and the ground is very flat, so you can prepare for ditching and sowing.

    “Wowo Wheat” is sown during the Cold Dew season. One or two days before sowing, use a plow to open ditches and make ridges, with the ditch width about six inches and the ridge width six or seven inches. The soil from the even-numbered ridges is used for covering the soil. After sowing, the soil is divided and covered in the sowing ditches on both sides. The soil from the odd-numbered ridges is left undisturbed to serve as a barrier for irrigation in the future. After ditching, apply 100 to 200 catties of crushed soybean cake per mu, and spread it evenly in the ditch by hand, then use a three-pronged rake to loosen the soil along the ditch, level the bottom of the ditch, mix the soil and soybean cake evenly, and cover it with a layer of soil to prevent the soybean cake from coming into contact with the seeds and affecting germination. Then use an iron shovel to compact the water-retaining ridges and irrigate along the ditch. The amount of water should not be too large, just enough to moisten the soil. After the soil has dried slightly, you can sow. Before sowing, the seeds should be soaked in water and quickly taken out to dry in the shade, and then sown. This can make the seeds spread evenly, and after soaking, it can also remove shriveled grains, reduce diseases, and make the emergence of seedlings faster and more uniform. The amount of sowing depends on the variety, about 17 to 20 catties per mu. The sowing method is to spread the seeds evenly in the prepared ditch by hand. The sowing density should be maintained at a distance of four or five fen between each seed, neither too far nor too close. After sowing, use an iron shovel to open the ridges prepared for covering the soil, and cover the soil in the sowing ditches on both sides (about one inch thick), then use a four-pronged rake to level the ground, so that the ground is flat and the soil is in close contact with the seeds, which is conducive to the emergence of seedlings.

    In the spring of the following year, when the wheat seedlings begin to sprout, apply 15 to 20 catties of ammonium sulfate per mu as topdressing. The topdressing should be evenly spread next to the wheat roots along the wheat ridges. Do not apply fertilizer on mornings with dew or on rainy days, because the ammonium sulfate sprinkled on the wheat leaves will dissolve in water and damage the wheat leaves. After applying topdressing, water heavily once. One or two days after watering, cultivate once with a two-pronged rake to maintain moisture in the soil. Water a second time before Grain Rain. Before watering, if the wheat seedlings are uneven in height, apply 5 to 10 catties of ammonium sulfate per mu once as "supplementary fertilizer" to make the wheat seedlings in the whole field grow consistently. Water along the ridges after applying supplementary fertilizer, the amount of water can be less than the first time. One or two days after watering, cultivate again with a two-pronged rake to preserve moisture and remove weeds. After this, because the wheat seedlings have grown vigorously and there are fewer weeds, no further cultivation is carried out. One or two days after the Beginning of Summer, the wheat plants begin to bear ears, water for the third time; the masses call this water "ear water", the main purpose is to make the wheat ears emerge neatly. Around Lesser Fullness, the wheat is filling, water for the fourth time; the masses call this water "flower water", the main purpose is to make the wheat grains full and produce more flour. After the wheat ears have set grains and the ears are heavy, if the weather is not too dry, do not water again.

    IV. Characteristics of the “Wowo Wheat” Cultivation Method

    The "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method is a great creation of Chinese farmers in wheat cultivation. The characteristics of this cultivation method are that, on the one hand, it conforms to the principle of dense planting, increasing the number of wheat plants per unit area; on the other hand, it connects and coordinates various yield-increasing factors, so that each wheat plant can develop healthily. These characteristics are now analyzed in detail as follows:

    1. Wide-row flat-ditch dense planting: Combining deep plowing with abundant fertilizer and implementing rational dense planting is a major reason why the "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method can increase yield. The sowing amount of "Wowo Wheat" is 17 to 20 catties per mu, which is nearly twice as much as the sowing amount of ordinary Lou wheat. According to field measurements, ordinary Lou wheat has only about 240,000 wheat ears per mu, while "Wowo Wheat" has as many as 450,000, which is more than 80 percent more than Lou wheat. The row spacing of Lou wheat is generally about one foot, and the sowing width is about one and a half inches, with wheat plants occupying only about 15 percent of the land area per mu, while the row spacing of "Wowo Wheat" is generally six or seven inches, and the sowing width is six inches, with wheat plants occupying 50 percent of the land area per mu, which is more than three times that of Lou wheat. Although "Wowo Wheat" increases the sowing amount, the sowing distance is equal, and the depth is consistent, because the sowing width is widened, the seeds will not be crowded together, and the wheat plants will develop evenly and healthily.

    2. Timely and appropriate fertilization and watering: Before sowing, apply barnyard manure rich in organic matter; at the time of sowing, apply soybean cake containing more nitrogen and phosphorus that is easy to decompose; this can not only continuously supply the needs of the entire wheat growth period, but also provide sufficient soluble fertilizer for seedling growth. In the early spring of the following year, the activity of soil bacteria is weak, and wheat is recovering its vitality, requiring a large supply of nutrients. At this time, the separate application of fast-acting ammonium sulfate as topdressing is suitable for the needs of wheat. At the same time, each application of fertilizer is followed by watering, which promptly supplies the water needed for wheat growth and fully exerts the effectiveness of the fertilizer.

    3. Select varieties that are resistant to yellowing and not easy to lodge: General varieties are prone to lodging and yellowing under conditions of abundant fertilizer and water. Therefore, "Wowo Wheat" must select varieties that are resistant to yellowing, not easy to lodge, and have great potential for high yield. Common varieties of "Wowo Wheat" in the Jiaodong area, such as White Sand Wheat and Large Purple Kai, have these conditions. Without superior varieties, it is not easy to obtain a high yield even with the "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method. In the winter of 1950, Chen Xingbang selected White Sand Wheat for planting and harvested 634 catties per mu. Another farmer, Wan Yousan, selected Market Wheat under the same cultivation conditions and harvested only 412 catties per mu. Farmer Li Ruifu planted Red Bald Wheat in 1950, and harvested 300 catties per mu due to lodging. In 1951, under the same cultivation conditions, he changed to planting White Sand Wheat, and as a result, he harvested 600 catties per mu.

    4. Appropriate late sowing: Under conditions of abundant fertilizer and water, if the "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method is used for sowing at the Autumn Equinox, the wheat seedlings will grow too vigorously in winter, and even joint, which is prone to frost damage; at the same time, it will tiller too much, making the wheat plants develop unevenly, and the wheat stalks will be uneven in height and the ears will be different in size, and the high yield cannot be achieved. Therefore, the sowing period of "Wowo Wheat" should be half a month later than that of ordinary Lou wheat, so that the wheat seedlings do not joint in winter, and control its tillering number, so that each wheat plant can maintain two to three effective tillers, and each tiller can grow a large ear, ensuring a bumper harvest.

    V. The Development Prospects of the “Wowo Wheat” Cultivation Method

    Some people believe that although the "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method is good, it can only be adopted in areas with convenient irrigation, abundant fertilizer, and abundant labor, and it is difficult to promote it universally. This statement is incorrect. It must be understood that the economic situation of Chinese farmers has gradually improved since liberation, and these conditions are not difficult to solve. Therefore, Wowo wheat has great development prospects. The fact that the cultivated area of "Wowo Wheat" has expanded rapidly in the past three years can prove this.

    “Wowo Wheat” is a very good cultivation method, but judging from the current situation of "Wowo Wheat" cultivation in Yexian County, there are still some shortcomings. Farmers in Yexian County lack barnyard manure, and they do not have the habit of raising pigs to accumulate manure and composting green manure. Generally, "Wowo Wheat" only applies about 1,000 to 3,000 catties of barnyard manure per mu, and a few apply ammonium sulfate as base fertilizer. These must be improved. Increasing the application of base fertilizer is the main key to continuously cultivating soil fertility and increasing the yield of "Wowo Wheat." Therefore, it is necessary to advocate applying more barnyard manure in the future; if 5,000 to 10,000 catties of barnyard manure can be applied per mu, the yield can be greatly increased.

    The "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method has mastered the principle of wide-row dense planting and fully utilizing the land, but the limit of widening the sowing width and the distance between the sowing widths must be paid close attention to. In some areas, the sowing width is widened, and at the same time, the row spacing is widened, so that the land cannot be fully utilized. In other areas, the sowing width is too wide, making it difficult to spread the seeds evenly. Before sowing "Wowo Wheat," it is necessary to open ditches at equal distances, with a row spacing and sowing width of about six inches. At the same time, it is necessary to spread the seeds evenly in the sowing ditch, maintaining a distance of five fen between each wheat grain, so that the soil fertility can be fully utilized, the nutritional area between each wheat grain can be expanded, the total number of plants per unit area can be increased, and the yield can be increased.

    In areas with good irrigation conditions, if the principles of the "Wowo Wheat" cultivation method can be appropriately adopted in combination with local specific conditions, implementing careful land preparation, deep plowing and dense planting, increasing fertilizer application, and selecting superior varieties, it is certain to increase the yield per unit area.

    我国农民的伟大创造——胶东“窝麦”栽培法
    中央人民政府农业部
    “窝麦”是山东掖县农民创造出来的一种水地小麦栽培方法。用这种方法栽培的小麦，一般的每亩可收获四、五百斤，多的每亩可收获六、七百斤以上。为了总结和推广我国农民创造的这种先进的农业科学技术经验，我部曾于一九五一年秋两度派员到掖县作实地调查，并在一九五二年初邀请掖县种窝麦有经验的劳动模范来部座谈。为了更深入地了解窝麦的生长情况和栽培经验，我部在今年小麦生长期间（五月至七月），又曾派员长驻该地作实地观察。现将两年来调查的结果整理发表。
    一、“窝麦”的历史
    “窝麦”是胶东掖县农民创造的一种水地小麦栽培方法，在种麦的时候，把种籽很均匀地撒播在灌了水、铺了粪、整理得很细致的宽沟里；因为麦苗好像生长在粪水窝中，当地农民就把它叫做“窝麦”
    （又因为它是开沟播种，泰安、莱芜一带的农民又把它叫做“沟麦”）。这种栽培方法究竟从何时创始，已无从考究。当地一位八十四岁的老农王肇兴说：他年幼的时候，当地人多地少（每人平均一亩左右），为了尽量利用土地，最初有一户农民在秋庄稼收获以后，不愿让打场地闲着，就用镢头把场地刨起，开沟种了大麦。他当时感到节令已迟，就多下些种籽，多上了些粪，多浇了些水，结果比用普通方法种植的大麦收获的还多。第二年有六户农民采用他的方法，收的粮食也很多。以后，这个种麦办法就逐渐传开了，由场地、园地发展到大田，由窝大麦发展到窝小麦，方法也逐步改进，慢慢地发展成了一套较完整的栽培方法。
    用这种方法种麦，产量都很高。但因这种栽培法必须具备粪大、水足和品种好等条件，所以在反动政府统治时代，一般贫苦农民是不能普遍采用的。在抗日战争以前，以种窝麦最多的掖县保旺区李家村来说，窝麦户仅占种麦户的百分之十五到十六。解放以后，当地农民生活已经改善，生产情绪高涨，生产投资大量增加，窝麦法便迅速发展起来了。现在掖县西障、过西、保旺、沿海等区农民种窝麦的已很普遍。西障区平原地带种窝麦的面积已达到耕地面积的百分之二十，丘陵地区也达到了百分之十。过西区后吕村一九五○年只种了二十亩窝麦，一九五一年就扩大到六十四亩，增加了两倍以上。目前山东省除掖县外，济南郊区、潍县、泰安、莱芜等地，也有不少农民种窝麦。窝麦栽培法正在迅速地被传播和推广。
    二、种“窝麦”的好处
    “窝麦”和普通耧麦（即用耧种的麦）比较，有很多好处：
    （一）产量高而稳定：产量高是“窝麦”最显著的特点。掖县农民用耧种的小麦，通常每亩产量只有一百斤至二百斤，最多的也不过三百斤左右；用
    “窝麦”法种的小麦，一般可收获四百斤到五百斤，多的可收获六、七百斤。下表是掖县几个农户
    一九五一年“窝麦”和耧麦的产量比较：（附图表）
    （二）可以保证一年两季丰收：当地水地都是实行玉米、小麦连茬的一年二熟制。但有时因秋玉米收获较晚，往往赶不及种麦。“窝麦”的播种期较耧麦迟半个月，因此秋收后仍可用“窝麦”法种小麦。由于时间比较从容，还可有一段时间进行精耕细作，恢复地力，这样就保证了两季丰收。陈兴邦是种“窝麦”的能手，一九五一年他的小麦每亩收获六三四斤，前作玉米每亩收获五六○斤。种一亩
    “窝麦”比种一亩耧麦要多费几个工，但普遍种麦和收麦时间，都是在农民最忙的季节，而“窝麦”播种期比较耧麦晚半个月，收获也迟二、三天，这样，人工、劳力都可以得到适当调节。
    （三）经济利益大：“窝麦”的产量既高，出的麦草也多。普通一亩“窝麦”的麦草比耧麦的麦草多一倍，其中可做草帽辫的麦杆多二分之一。胶东是产草帽辫的地区，种“窝麦”可充分供给这种副业的原料。因此，种窝麦虽然要多费些劳力和肥料，但所增加的收入则远超过所用的成本。据统计，只麦草和麦杆（可做草帽辫的）的收入，就可抵偿多施肥料的价值。下表是陈兴邦的“窝麦”和他的地邻陈秀德的耧麦收益比较：（附图表）
    注：1、按一九五○年小麦每斤九五○元计算；2、豆饼每斤按七五○元计算；3、厩肥按每三十斤折合豆饼一斤计算；4、肥田粉每斤按一、七○○元计算；5、人工每个按一二、○○○元计算；6、麦草每斤按七○元计算；7、麦杆（做草帽辫的）每斤按二五○元计算。
    三、“窝麦”的栽培方法
    在秋分前玉米收获后，立即进行第一次深耕，由地的两边耕起，向外翻土，深达六、七寸。耕后耙、耢各一次。接着撒施土粪，每亩一千五百斤到五千斤，进行第二次耕地，改由田的中缝耕起，向内翻土，使中缝密合。耕后再耙、耢各一次。经过这样耕耙后，土层深厚松软，肥料均匀混合，地面很平整，便可准备开沟播种。
    “窝麦”在寒露节播种。播种前一、二日用犁开沟做垅，沟宽约六寸，垅宽六、七寸。双数垅的土供覆土用，播种后把土分盖在两边的播种沟内。单数垅的土不动，留供将来灌水时挡水用。开沟后，每亩施碾碎的豆饼一百斤到二百斤，用手均匀撒在沟内，然后用三齿耙顺沟搂动土壤，把沟底搂平，使土与豆饼混合均匀，并在上面盖一层土，以免豆饼和种子接触，影响发芽。接着用铁锹把挡水的垅拍实，顺沟浇水。水量不要大，以润湿土壤为度，待土稍干，就可播种。播种前，种籽要用水浸泡，并很快捞出阴干，然后播种。这样可使种子撒的均匀，经过浸种还可除去秕粒，减少病害，出苗也较快而整齐。播种量视品种而定，每亩约十七斤到二十斤。播种方法是用手把种子均匀撒布在预先做好的沟内。播种密度应保持每粒种子相隔四、五分的距离，不要过远或过近。播种后，把准备做覆土用的垅用铁锹拨开，把土覆盖在两边播种沟内（约一寸厚），然后用四齿耙把地面搂平，使地面平整，土壤和种籽密接，以利幼苗出土。
    在来年春天麦苗开始萌动时，每亩施硫酸铔十五斤到二十斤作追肥。追肥要顺着麦垅均匀撒在麦根旁边。不要在有露水的早晨或阴雨天施肥，因为撒在麦叶上的硫酸铔遇水溶解，会损害麦叶。施追肥后浇一次大水。浇水后一、二天，用二齿耙中耕一次，以保持土中水分。谷雨前浇第二次水。浇水前，如果麦苗生长高矮不齐，每亩可用硫酸铔五斤到十斤，施一次“补肥”，使全田麦苗生长一致。补肥后顺垅浇水，水量可较第一次少些。浇水后一、二日，又用二齿耙中耕，保墒除草。这以后，由于麦苗生长已旺，杂草较少，不再进行中耕。立夏后一、二日，麦株开始孕穗，浇第三次水；群众把这次水叫“苞水”，主要作用是使小麦抽穗整齐。小满前后，小麦灌浆，浇第四次水；群众把这次水叫“花水”，主要作用是使麦粒饱满多出面。在麦穗着粒，穗子沉重以后，如果天气不太旱，便不要再浇水。
    四、“窝麦”栽培法的特点
    “窝麦”栽培法是我国农民在小麦栽培上的一个大创造。这一栽培方法的特点，一方面是符合密植的原则，增加了单位面积上小麦的株数；一方面把各个丰产因素连系配合起来，使每棵麦株都能发育健壮。现在把这些特点具体分析如下：
    一、宽幅平沟密植：结合深耕多肥，实行合理密植，是“窝麦”栽培法所以能够提高产量的一个主要原因。“窝麦”的播种量每亩十七斤至二十斤，比一般耧麦的播种量增多将近一倍。根据田间实测，一般耧麦每亩仅约有二十四万个麦穗，而“窝麦”最多的有四十五万个，比耧麦多百分之八十以上。耧麦一般行距约一尺，播幅约一寸半，每亩麦株实占土地面积百分之十五，而“窝麦”一般行距六、七寸，播幅六寸，每亩麦株实占土地面积百分之五十，比耧麦增加三倍以上。“窝麦”虽然增加了播种量，但由于加宽了播幅，撒种的距离均等，深浅一致，种籽不会拥挤在一起，而且麦株发育也均衡健壮。
    二、适时适量地施肥浇水：在播种前，施用富于有机质的厩肥；在播种时，施用含氮、磷较多而易于分解的豆饼；这样既可源源供给整个小麦生育期的需要，又有足够的可溶性肥料供给幼苗生长。在来年早春时候，土壤细菌活动能力较弱，而小麦正在恢复生机，需要大量的养分供应，这时分别施用速效的硫酸铔作追肥，是适合小麦需要的。同时每施一次肥，紧接着就浇一次水，这就及时供给了小麦生长所需的水分，和充分发挥了肥料的效用。
    三、选用抵抗黄疸力强和不易倒伏的品种：一般品种在粪大水足的情况下容易倒伏和生黄疸病，因此，“窝麦”必须选用抗黄疸力强，不易倒伏和丰产潜在力大的品种。胶东地区“窝麦”的通用品种如白沙麦、大紫楷等，都具备了这些条件。没有优良品种，虽然采用“窝麦”栽培办法，仍不易获得高额的产量。一九五零年冬天，陈兴邦选用白沙麦种，每亩收获六三四斤，另一个农民万有三在同样耕作条件下，选用市麦种，每亩只收获四一二斤。农民李瑞福在一九五零年种植红秃头麦，因倒伏每亩收获三百斤，一九五一年在同样耕作条件下改种了白沙麦，结果每亩收获六百斤。
    四、适期晚播：在粪大水足的情况下，如果采用
    “窝麦”栽培法在秋分下种，麦苗在冬季就会生长过旺，甚至拔节，易遭冻害；同时会分蘖过多，使麦株发育不平衡，将来麦杆高矮不齐，穗头大小不一，不能达到高额产量。因此，“窝麦”播种期要比一般耧麦迟半月，使麦苗在冬季不拔节，并控制它的分蘖数，使每株小麦能保持二个到三个有效分蘖，每一分蘖上都能莠一个大穗，保证丰产。
    五、“窝麦”栽培法的发展前途
    有人认为“窝麦”栽培法虽然好，但只能在灌溉便利、肥料充足、劳动力多的地区采用，普遍推广有困难。这种说法是不正确的。必须了解，我国农民的经济情况在解放以后已逐步改善，这些条件是不难解决的，因此，窝麦是有很大的发展前途的。近三年来“窝麦”栽培面积迅速扩大的事实，即可证明。
    “窝麦”是一种很好的栽培方法，但就目前掖县“窝麦”栽培情况来看，还有一些缺点。掖县农民缺乏厩肥，也没有养猪积肥和沤绿肥的习惯。一般“窝麦”每亩仅施厩粪一千斤到三千斤左右，还有少数将硫酸铔作基肥施用的。这些都必须设法改进。增施基肥是不断培养地力，提高“窝麦”产量的主要关键，因此今后应提倡多施厩肥；如能每亩施五千斤到一万斤厩肥，则产量还可大大提高。
    “窝麦”栽培法掌握了宽幅密植，充分利用土地的原则，但对加宽播幅的限度和播幅间的距离，必须十分注意。有些地区，加宽了播幅，同时把行距加得更宽，这样就不能充分利用地力。也有的地区，把播幅加得太宽，使撒种不容易均匀。“窝麦”在播种前必须等距离开沟，行距、播幅以六寸左右较好，同时必须在播种沟内均匀撒种，使每棵麦粒间保持五分的距离，这样才能充分发挥地力，扩大每棵麦粒间的营养面积，增加单位面积上的总株数，提高产量。
    在灌溉条件较好的地区，如能结合当地具体情况，适当采用“窝麦”栽培方法的原则，实行精细整地，深耕密植，增施肥料，选用优良品种等，提高单位面积产量是有把握的。
