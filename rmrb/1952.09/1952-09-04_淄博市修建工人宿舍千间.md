    Zibo City Builds Thousands of Rooms of Workers' Dormitories
    Editor: The Zibo Municipal People's Government of Shandong Province has allocated 3.5 billion yuan to build more than a thousand rooms of dormitories for workers in front of Mount Emei, and named this place "Emei New Village." The entire construction area of Emei New Village is planned to be 158 mu, 3 fen, and 6 li. Two roads, 10 meters wide, and eleven roads, 5 to 7 meters wide, will be built in the village. All the houses in the village will be built in rows, with a distance of 8.5 meters between rows. Two to five meters of open space will also be left on both sides of the road for planting trees. Green belts will be set up in and around the village to regulate the air in the village. Open space is reserved in the center of the village for the construction of staff and workers' children's schools, cooperatives, nurseries, cultural palaces, etc. This beautiful Emei New Village will be fully under construction in early September.
    Nearly 100,000 workers live in Zibo City. The living conditions of the workers are extremely poor. Before liberation, most of the workers had nowhere to settle down. Some lived in dilapidated temples, some lived under bridges, and some even slept on the streets. Since liberation, the people's government has tried all kinds of methods, but due to economic constraints, it has not been able to solve all the problems. Now, with the fundamental improvement of the national financial and economic situation, the government has decided to solve the housing problem of the workers.

    淄博市修建工人宿舍千间
    编辑同志：山东淄博市人民政府已拨出三十五亿元人民币，准备在峨嵋山前给工人修建千余间宿舍，并把这地方命名为“峨嵋新村”。峨嵋新村的整个修建面积计划为一百五十八市亩三分六厘。村中准备修十公尺宽的马路两条、五至七公尺宽的马路十一条。全村房屋将分排修建，排与排之间距离八公尺五远。马路两旁还留出二公尺至五公尺宽的空地准备植树。村中及周围空地设绿林地带，以调剂村中的空气。村中心留有空地以备修建职工子弟学校、合作社、托儿所、文化宫等用。这个美丽的峨嵋新村，九月初就全部动工了。
    淄博市聚居着近十万工人。工人的居住条件极坏，解放前工人大都无处安身，有的住在破庙里，有的住在桥底下，有人甚至露宿街上。解放以后人民政府虽然想出种种办法，但由于经济条件的限制，不能全部解决。现在随着国家财政经济状况的根本好转，政府已决心来解决工人的住宿问题。
