To ensure the autumn harvest is not lost and to promptly correct the "waiting for a good harvest" mentality of cadres and farmers, farmers in Anhui Province are launching a campaign to inspect production and evaluate crops.

This year, autumn crops in Anhui Province are generally growing well, and a good harvest is expected. As a result, farmers in many areas have relaxed their mid-season cultivation and fertilization efforts, simply waiting for the harvest; some cadres have also become complacent. In fact, mid-season rice, late rice, sorghum, and other crops throughout the province still need more than ten days to a month before they can be harvested. The current period is crucial for mid-season cultivation, fertilization, and, in some areas, pest control and drought resistance. Therefore, the Party and government leading organs in many counties and districts have decided to mobilize farmers to carry out a production inspection and crop evaluation campaign before the autumn harvest. The local committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Chu County, the Chu County People's Commissioner's Office, and the Party and government leading organs in counties such as Feidong and Xuyi have all dispatched many cadres to go deep into key districts and townships to assist local work. The inspection and evaluation first select key areas, focusing on agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, to evaluate the growth of their crops and check the extent to which they have completed their production plans. Members participating in the inspection and evaluation include cadres and production activists from mutual aid teams (cooperatives), experienced veteran farmers, and also some individual farmers with good production. At present, the key inspection and evaluation work in various places has been completed, and the campaign is being launched throughout the province.

In the production inspection and crop evaluation campaign, cadres and farmers in areas where the work is taken seriously have received due education, and the "waiting for a good harvest" mentality has been eliminated. After the inspection and evaluation in Huaqiao Township, Jinzhai County, the men and women laborers of the Xu Guoqing mutual aid team went to the fields together and cleared the weeds from seventeen mu of cornfields in one day; the members of the Zhang Liangbao mutual aid team used their evening time to apply more than 160 loads of night soil fertilizer to the cornfields. After the inspection and evaluation in Gaolou Township, Huaiyuan County, in late July, the farmers of the whole township immediately actively engaged in the fight against drought and pest control. Up to now, they have dug eight wells and a small river, and currently, seven or eight hundred people are using waterwheels to irrigate the crops every day. Pest control has also achieved good results. (Xinhua News Agency)

    安徽农民开展检查生产和评比庄稼运动
    为了保证秋季丰收不致落空，及时纠正干部、农民的“等丰收”思想，安徽省农民正在开展检查生产和评比庄稼运动。
    安徽省今年秋季作物普遍长得较好，丰收有望，因而许多地区的农民放松了中耕、追肥工作，单纯等待丰收；有些干部也产生了自满情绪。事实上，全省的中熟稻和晚稻以及高粱等其他庄稼，都还须十多天到一月左右才能收割，眼前时期的中耕、追肥工作和部分地区的除虫、抗旱工作非常重要。因此，该省许多县、区的党、政领导机关就决定在秋收前发动农民开展一个检查生产和评比庄稼运动。中共滁县地方委员会、滁县人民专员公署和肥东、盱眙等县的党、政领导机关都抽出许多干部，深入到重点区、乡协助当地工作。检查评比首先选择重点地区，以农业生产合作社和互助组为主，评比他们庄稼的生长情况，检查他们完成生产计划的程度。参加检查评比的成员包括干部和互助组（社）中的生产积极分子、生产经验丰富的老农，也吸收个别生产较好的单干户农民。现在，各地重点检查评比工作已经完毕，运动正在全省范围内展开。
    在检查生产和评比庄稼运动中，凡是比较认真的地区，干部、农民都受到了应有的教育，“等丰收”思想就消除了。金寨县花桥乡在检查评比后，徐国清互助组的男女劳动力一齐下地，一天就把十七亩玉米田里的草拔干净了；张良保互助组组员们利用晚上时间，在玉米田里上了一百六十多挑水粪。怀远县高楼乡在七月下旬检查评比后，全乡农民立即积极地投入抗旱和灭虫斗争。到现在，他们已经开了八口井和一条小河，目前又每天有七、八百人车水灌溉庄稼，灭虫也有良好成绩。（新华社）
