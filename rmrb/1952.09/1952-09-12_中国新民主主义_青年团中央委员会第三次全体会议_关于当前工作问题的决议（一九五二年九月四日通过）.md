    (I)
    Since the Second Plenary Session of the Youth League Central Committee last November, the work of the Youth League has been further developed under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels. The Youth League organizations at all levels have guided the members and the broad masses of young people to rally around the Communist Party, actively participate in the great mass movements such as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, increased production and frugality, and ideological remolding, and have played a greater role as the Party's active and loyal assistants. Through these great revolutionary practical struggles and the Party's education, the youth's awareness has been further enhanced, the Youth League organization has been strengthened, and the Youth League's influence among the youth masses has been broadened. Under the leadership of the Party, it has become an important shock force for consolidating our people's democratic dictatorship and building a great motherland.

    However, the scale of progress in the Youth League's work still cannot keep up with the needs of the people's cause. Therefore, all comrades in the Youth League must actively strive under the leadership of the Party to further advance the work of the entire Youth League.

    (II)
    Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our great motherland has completed a series of social reforms and achieved a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation; it has powerfully resisted the aggression of US imperialism and strengthened national defense; and it is now welcoming a high tide of large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. Chinese youth must actively participate in the construction of the motherland and stand at the forefront of the motherland's construction. In order to be able to work well, learning has become an even more prominent task for Chinese youth. In this new historical period, if the Youth League is to further become a capable assistant to the Party, it must guide the members and the broad masses of young people to be better at working and learning, so that they can truly be as Lenin instructed: "Everyone is knowledgeable and at the same time good at labor."

    The heroic activeness of young people in their work is the infinite strength of our country's construction, but this heroic activeness in work must be combined with the task of learning more new knowledge. Facts have proved that if there is only political enthusiasm without more knowledge, young people cannot participate well in construction work, and Youth League cadres cannot effectively lead and unite the youth masses. Therefore, Youth League members and the broad masses of young people must strive to understand new knowledge, study politics, study science and technology, and improve culture, and they must learn diligently at all times in work and struggle to enrich themselves. All cadres in the Youth League must not only strive to study Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and study the Party's policies, but also strive to possess the necessary specialized knowledge according to the needs of their work posts. Therefore, the issue of learning, the issue of combining learning and work, and the issue of how the Youth League can assist the Party in educating the entire young generation are the hallmarks of the Youth League's work.

    (III)
    At present, Youth League organizations throughout the country should, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, conduct in-depth propaganda among the broad masses of young people about the great victories of the motherland in the past three years and the great prospects of the motherland, and launch a high tide of striving to learn and work hard for the construction of the great motherland, focusing on the following key tasks.

    1.  Vigorously assist the Party in carrying out the patriotic campaign for increased production and frugality in industrial and mining enterprises. Encourage young workers to actively learn advanced production experience and continuously improve their technical level.

    2.  Vigorously assist the Party in carrying out democratic political construction in rural areas, promote the patriotic movement for increased agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas, and encourage young peasants to actively learn new agricultural technologies and advanced production experience. In areas where land reform has not been completed, we must also vigorously assist the Party in completing land reform.

    3.  Continue to encourage the broad masses of young people to love the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, cultivate the youth's fighting will to defend the motherland and defend peace, and encourage the youth to enthusiastically learn modern military technology. Actively promote sports.

    4.  Vigorously assist the Party and the People's Government in strengthening school work and cultivating construction cadres for the country. Among the masses, promote the quick literacy method and actively participate in the patriotic health movement. Cultivate new morals of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property among the broad masses of young people, and strengthen the education of internationalism.

    5.  Assist the Party in strengthening work among young people of minority nationalities and enhance national unity. Continue to strengthen the solidarity work of international democratic youth.

    On the above-mentioned work fronts, Youth League members should have the spirit of overcoming any difficulties and strive to become models of work and learning. They should be good at using persuasion to overcome various backward phenomena and bad habits among the youth masses. They should be good at cooperating with adults, learning from adults, and also be good at taking care of and helping the broad masses of young people to advance together.

    (IV)
    "Ensuring the Party's leadership is the most important thing in all the work of the Youth League." This is Stalin's teaching. Youth League committees at all levels must regularly and earnestly discuss the Party Central Committee's principles and policies, and must at any time, based on the specific work arrangements of Party committees at all levels and the tasks assigned to the Youth League, under the close leadership of Party committees at all levels, formulate their own appropriate plans in accordance with the specific circumstances of local youth work and actively carry out work. Higher-level Youth League committees should help and lead lower-level Youth League committees in implementing the instructions of Party committees.

    (V)
    Youth League committees at all levels must further improve their working methods, go deep into the masses, study experiences at all times, not only study the experience of leadership work, but also focus on studying the experience of various activities in production, technology, and learning among the masses, and reflect various experiences to Party committees and relevant departments. When studying the experience of mass activities, they must be good at selecting outstanding models, and under the leadership and unified planning of the Party, adopt methods such as written reports, literary creation, touring lectures, holding forums, and开展览会 exhibitions, etc., to vividly and concretely introduce advanced deeds and promote advanced experience. For those young advanced figures who create advanced experience, they should be constantly educated, helped to continue learning, and constantly progress.

    Youth League cadres and ordinary members at all levels should keep in mind Chairman Mao's instructions on avoiding pride in their work and study. Chairman Mao often said: "The enemy of learning is one's own satisfaction. To seriously learn something, one must start with not being complacent." The attitude in work is the same. The comrades of the Youth League must maintain such a style themselves, and must constantly use this style to educate the youth masses.

    (VI)
    With the development of various practical struggles and the rising revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of young people, a large number of activists have continuously emerged among the youth. Youth League organizations in various places should continue to actively carry out the work of developing new members, appropriately expand the Youth League organization to adapt to the tasks of the Youth League's work. When recruiting new members, it is necessary to accept past experiences and lessons, on the one hand, to prevent the tendency of closed-doorism, and on the other hand, to prevent the bias of laissez-faire. Therefore, Youth League committees at all levels must formulate plans for recruiting members in accordance with the situation of local youth work, and appropriately control them, and must not lower the conditions for recruiting new members. After each new member joins the League, they should be incorporated into the organization, so that they can live an organizational life, assign them certain work, and seriously educate them.

    While expanding the Youth League organization, it is necessary to strengthen the communist education of League members in conjunction with the Party's rectification campaign and Party building.

    (VII)
    The increasing development of the Youth League's work requires Youth League committees at all levels to actively cultivate cadres in greater numbers, and to constantly discover those outstanding individuals who are loyal to the common cause of the people, and boldly promote them and place them in appropriate work positions. There are still vacancies in the current organizational structure of the Youth League, and Youth League committees at all levels must quickly supplement them under the leadership of their subordinate Party committees to facilitate the work.

    Youth League committees at all levels should systematically transport cadres to the Party according to the needs of the Party. This is an important task of the Youth League.

    (VIII)
    In order to systematically discuss how to mobilize the entire Youth League and launch the broad masses of young people to welcome the country's large-scale construction, the Third Plenary Session unanimously decided to convene the Second National Congress of the Youth League between spring and summer next year. The specific date will be decided by the Secretariat of the Youth League Central Committee. The main topics of the Congress are as follows:

    (1) Political Report of the CPC Central Committee; (2) Work Report of the Youth League Central Committee; (3) Revision of the Youth League Constitution; (4) Election of the new Central Committee.

    Before the Second National Congress is convened, Youth League committees of provinces, cities, and counties that have not held a congress or have not held a congress for a long time should generally hold a congress to elect or re-elect leading organs, summarize work experience, and arrange future work.

    中国新民主主义  青年团中央委员会第三次全体会议
    关于当前工作问题的决议
    （一九五二年九月四日通过）
    （一）
    从去年十一月团的二中全会到现在，青年团的工作，在党中央和各级党委的领导下，有了进一步的发展。各级团的组织，引导着团员和广大青年，围绕在共产党的周围，积极地参加了“三反”、“五反”、增产节约、思想改造等伟大的群众运动，更大地发挥了党的积极的忠实的助手作用。经过这些伟大的革命实际斗争和党的教育，青年的觉悟更加提高，团的组织更加壮大，团在青年群众中的影响更加深广，在党的领导下，已成为巩固我国人民民主专政和建设伟大祖国的一支重要的突击力量。
    但团的工作的进展规模，还赶不上人民事业的需要，因此，全团同志必须在党的领导下积极努力，把全团的工作更加推向前进。　　
    （二）
    由于党中央和毛主席的英明领导，伟大的祖国已经完成了一系列的社会改革，取得了财政经济情况的根本好转；有力地抗击了美帝国主义的侵略，加强了国防；现在正迎接着大规模的经济建设与文化建设的高潮。中国青年必须积极地参加祖国的建设，站在祖国建设的前列。而为着能够很好地工作，学习就成为中国青年更加特别突出的任务。在这个新的历史时期，青年团要进一步地成为党的得力助手，就必须引导团员和广大青年更善于工作和学习，使他们能够真正如列宁所指示的：“个个都是有知识的，同时又都是善于劳动的”。
    青年们在工作中的英勇积极，乃是我国建设的无限的力量，但必须把这种工作中的英勇积极和学习更多的新知识这一个任务结合起来。事实证明：如果只有政治热情而没有更多的知识，青年们就不能很好地参加建设工作，团的干部就不能够有力地领导和团结青年群众。因此，青年团员和广大青年必须力求通晓新的知识，学习政治，学习科学和技术，提高文化，而在工作中和斗争中都必须随时认真地学习以充实自己。团内一切干部，不但要努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习党的政策，并且要依据自己工作岗位的需要，努力具备必要的专门知识。也因此，关于学习的问题，关于学习和工作相结合的问题，关于青年团如何协助党教育好整个青年一代的问题，乃是青年团测验自己工作的标志。
    （三）
    在目前，全国团的组织都应该在党中央和各级党委领导下，向广大青年深入宣传祖国三年来的伟大胜利和祖国的伟大远景，掀起为建设伟大祖国而努力学习和努力工作的热潮，着重进行下列几项中心工作。
    1、大力协助党开展工矿企业中的爱国增产节约运动。鼓舞青年工人积极学习先进生产经验，不断提高自己的技术水平。
    2、大力协助党进行农村中的民主建政工作，推行农村的爱国丰产运动和互助合作运动，鼓舞青年农民积极学习新的农业技术和先进生产经验。在没有完成土地改革的地区，还要大力协助党完成土地改革。
    3、继续鼓舞广大青年热爱人民解放军和人民志愿军，培养青年保卫祖国保卫和平的战斗意志，鼓舞青年热心学习现代化的军事技术。积极倡导体育运动。
    4、大力协助党和人民政府，加强学校工作，培养国家的建设干部。在群众中，推行速成识字法，积极参加爱国卫生运动。在广大青年中，培养爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的新道德，并加强国际主义的教育。
    5、协助党加强少数民族青年中的工作，增进民族团结。继续加强国际民主青年的团结工作。
    在上述各个工作战线上，青年团员都应具有克服任何困难的精神，争取成为工作和学习的模范。他们应该善于用说服的方法，克服青年群众中的各种落后现象和不良习惯。他们应该善于和成年人合作，向成年人学习，又善于照顾和帮助广大青年而共同前进。
    （四）
    “保证党的领导是青年团全部工作中之最主要的一件事”。这是斯大林的教训。各级团委必须经常地认真地讨论党中央的方针政策，并且要随时根据各级党委的具体工作部署和交给团的任务，在各级党委的密切领导下，按照当地青年工作的具体情况，订出自己的适当计划，积极地进行工作。上级团委应当帮助和领导下级团委贯彻党委的指示。
    （五）
    各级团委必须进一步地改善自己的工作方法，深入群众，随时研究经验，不仅要研究领导工作的经验，而且要着重地研究群众中生产的、技术的、学习的种种活动的经验，并把各种经验向党委和有关部门反映。在研究群众活动的经验的时候，必须善于选择优秀的典型，在党的领导和统一计划下，采用文字报道、文艺创作、巡回讲演、开座谈会、开展览会等等方法，生动地具体地介绍先进的事迹，推广先进的经验。对于那些创造先进经验的青年先进人物，应当经常地对他们进行教育，帮助他们继续学习，不断进步。
    各级团的干部和一般团员，在工作和学习中都应该牢记毛主席关于避免骄傲的指示。毛主席经常说：“学习的敌人是自己的满足。要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。”在工作中的态度也是同样的。青年团的同志自己必须保持这样的作风，并且必须不断地用这种作风来教育青年群众。
    （六）
    随着各种实际斗争的发展和广大青年群众革命性的高涨，在青年中不断地涌现了大批的积极分子，各地团的组织应该继续积极地进行发展新团员的工作，恰当地扩大团的组织，以适应团的工作任务。在吸收新团员的时候，必须接受过去的经验教训，一方面防止关门主义的倾向，另方面防止放任自流的偏向。因此，各级团委都要按照当地青年工作的情况订出吸收团员的计划，并适当地加以控制，不得降低吸收新团员的条件。每个新团员入团后，就要将他们编入组织，使他们过组织生活，分配他们一定的工作，并认真地对他们进行教育。
    在扩大团的组织的同时，必须结合党的整风和党的建设，加强对团员的共产主义教育工作。
    （七）
    团的工作的日益开展，要求各级团委积极地更大量地培养干部，并不断地去发现那些忠实于人民共同事业的有能力的优秀分子，大胆地把他们提拔起来，放在恰当的工作岗位上。现在团内编制尚有缺额，各级团委必须在所属党委领导下，迅速地加以补充，以利工作进行。
    各级团委应当根据党的需要，有计划地向党输送干部。这是团的一个重要任务。
    （八）
    为了系统地讨论如何动员全团并发动广大青年迎接国家大规模的建设，三中全会一致通过在明年春夏之间召开团的全国第二次代表大会，具体日期，由团中央书记处决定。代表大会的主要议题如下：
    （1）中共中央政治报告；（2）团中央工作报告；（3）修改团章；（4）选举新的中央委员会。
    在全国第二次代表大会召开之前，凡属没有开过或很久没有开过代表大会的省、市、县团委，一般地都要开一次代表大会，选举或改选领导机关，总结工作经验并布置今后工作。
