Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 11th: This reporter reports: American generals, who have been beaten black and blue in the more than two years of the Korean War, can now only regard the slaughter of peaceful residents as their only "victory."

When the U.S. side realized that it was impossible to implement so-called "military pressure" on the land front to force our side to submit at the negotiating table, they placed their hopes on "naval and air attacks." Their first shot was the barbaric bombing of the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant on June 23rd. Since then, the U.S. side has continuously clamored about how "powerful" its air force is, and successively issued naval and air battle reports of "remarkable achievements." But less than two months later, the commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Briscoe, said something discouraging. He said on August 20th that the U.S. side's "naval and air attacks" were a losing business, and that it was "impossible" for the U.S. side to destroy the supply lines of the Korean and Chinese sides with its navy and air force. Then, the commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force stationed in Korea, Backus, came out on August 24th and said that it was "very difficult" to defeat the Korean and Chinese People's Army with air power. Finally, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, Van Fleet, also admitted on September 5th that "air strikes against the Communists cannot determine the war."

So what can determine the war? Van Fleet said: "We will always need ground troops, and nothing can replace infantry." In other words, only the army can determine the war. People see from these words of the American generals the embarrassment of the American aggressor group: the army has no strength to launch an offensive, so it has to rely on the navy and air force, but the navy and air force are useless, and it still has to rely on the army, and the U.S. Secretary of the Army Pace publicly admitted on September 7th: The US Army does not have the "strength to launch an offensive and achieve victory."

The American generals are thus pursuing their wishful military "victory" in a magic lantern show, but the shadow of "victory" is always so渺茫 (miǎo máng - dim and distant). Nevertheless, the American generals still console themselves with their despicable and beastly purpose. Just after the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force generals came out one after another to admit that "military pressure" had failed, the U.S. International News Service suddenly reported that: "American strategic leaders, including the commander of the United Nations forces, Clark, are increasingly convinced that the intensified Korean air war is being rewarded."

This so-called "reward" is naturally not the "brilliant achievements" in the battle reports issued by Clark and his ilk, such as "military industries" and "supplies," because they are of course clearer than anyone else about the authenticity of those battle reports. Their so-called "reward" is deduced from the solemn condemnation by the Korean and Chinese sides of the American air force's barbaric bombing of peaceful facilities and residential areas. The American generals said that since the Korean and Chinese sides had issued such a condemnation, it proved that the Korean and Chinese sides had suffered "trauma." This ridiculous argument, based on absurd logic, was first invented by Harrison at the armistice talks on August 19th, and then widely used by the American generals as if they had found a treasure.

In fact, even if the American generals do not use the condemnation of the Korean and Chinese sides as a basis, the whole world knows that their indiscriminate bombing has caused "trauma," but it is not the "military industries" or "supplies" mentioned in the U.S. battle reports that have suffered the "trauma," but the peaceful residents, the elderly, the weak, women and children of Korea. The Associated Press reported on September 2nd that when the U.S. Air Force bombed a so-called "military industrial center" in northeastern Korea, the U.S. Navy aircraft conducting the air raid were "fully loaded with highly lethal bombs." At first glance, using "highly lethal bombs" to destroy "military industrial centers" seems to be a new "creation" of the American generals who are good at inventing "new tactics," but as soon as people think about it, they will immediately see that the U.S. Air Force uses these "highly lethal bombs" in order to kill peaceful residents in large numbers.

The American generals are furious because of the failure of the Korean War, but they are helpless. They are now determined to seek "rewards" from the blood of the peaceful people of Korea, but they had better remember the saying "blood debt must be paid in blood," and they will have to repay this blood debt one day.

### 新华社记者  评美方以屠杀和平居民为“胜利”的可耻目的

    评美方以屠杀和平居民为“胜利”的可耻目的
    【新华社开城十一日电】本社记者报道：在两年多的侵朝战争中被打得腮肿脸青的美国将军们，现在只能把屠杀和平居民作为他们的唯一“胜利”了。
    美方在认识到要想在陆地战线上实施所谓“军事压力”以迫使我方在谈判桌上屈服已不可能的时候，就把希望寄托在“海空攻击”上。他们的第一炮就是在六月二十三日野蛮地轰炸鸭绿江发电厂。从那时起，美方就不断叫嚷他们的空军力量如何“强大”，接连发表“战果赫赫”的海空战报。但是不到两个月以后，美国的远东舰队司令布里斯柯却说出了泄气话，他在八月二十日说：美方的“海空攻击”是一件蚀本生意，美方要想用海空军摧毁朝中方面的供应线，是“办不到的事”。接着驻朝鲜的美国第五航空队司令巴喀斯在八月二十四日出来说：要想用空军力量来打垮朝中人民军队，“是很难的事”。最后，侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在九月五日也承认说：“对共产党进行的空袭不能决定战争。”
    那么能够决定战争的是什么东西呢？范佛里特说：“我们将永远需要地面部队，没有任何东西能代替步兵。”换句话说，只有陆军才能决定战争。人们从美国将军们的这些话里，看到了美国侵略集团的一副窘相：陆军没有力量发动进攻，只好依靠海空军，但是海空军没有用处，还是要依靠陆军，而美国陆军部长佩斯在九月七日又公开承认：美国陆军没有“发动攻势而取得胜利的力量”。
    美国将军们就是这样在走马灯里追求着他们痴心妄想的军事“胜利”，而“胜利”的影子却永远是那么渺茫。尽管如此，美国将军们仍然拿他们的卑鄙的兽性的目的来聊以自慰。就在美国陆海空军将领一个接一个地出来承认“军事压力”已告失败之后，美国国际新闻社忽然报道说：美国的“战略领袖们，包括联合国军司令克拉克在内，都越来越相信，加紧进行的朝鲜空战正得到报偿”。
    这个所谓“偿报”自然不是克拉克之流所发表的那些战报中的“辉煌战果”，如什么“军事工业”、“供应品”之类，因为他们对于那些战报的真实性当然比谁都清楚。他们的所谓“报偿”是从朝中方面对于美国空军野蛮地轰炸和平设备与居民地区的严正谴责演绎而来的。美国将军们说，既然朝中方面发出了这种谴责，那就证明朝中方面受到了“创伤”。这个根据荒谬的逻辑而成立的可笑的论据，是哈利逊在八月十九日的停战谈判会议上首先发明出来的，接着就被美国将军们如获至宝地广泛应用。
    其实，即使美国将军们不拿朝中方面的谴责做根据，全世界也知道他们的狂轰滥炸已经造成了“创伤”，不过遭受“创伤”的并非美方战报中所说的是什么“军事工业”或者“供应品”，而是朝鲜的和平居民和老弱妇孺。美联社在九月二日报道美国空军轰炸朝鲜东北部的一个所谓“军事工业中心”时就说，进行这次空袭的美国海军飞机“满装着杀伤性很强的炸弹”。乍一看来，用“杀伤性很强的炸弹”来摧毁“军事工业中心”，似乎又是善于发明“新战术”的美国将军的新“创造”，但是只要稍稍一想，人们就会立刻看出，美国空军使用这些“杀伤性很强的炸弹”，为的是大批杀伤和平居民。
    美国将军们因为侵朝战争失败而恼怒得发狂，但又无可奈何。他们现在决心要从朝鲜和平人民的鲜血中觅取“报偿”，可是他们最好记住“血债血还”这句话，他们终有一天要偿还这一笔血债的。
