Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the significance of conducting production capacity assessment in the machine industry, saying: The vast majority of machine and electrical appliance manufacturing factories in old China were essentially repair shops. Since liberation, thanks to the efforts of the vast number of workers, they have been able to manufacture various machines themselves, and the output has been continuously increasing; however, there is still a certain degree of confusion in management, and the formulation of plans often lacks objectivity. The main reason for this is that there is insufficient understanding of the factory's actual production capacity, and it is not known where the key to hindering production development lies, making it difficult to implement specific and effective improvement measures.

The Soviet Union's advanced experience of "production capacity assessment" is an effective way to solve this problem. Its main functions are in the following three aspects:

(1) Discovering the weak links in the factory's production capacity, clarifying the direction of improvement, and seeking comprehensive improvement in the level of production capacity. In the process of assessing production capacity, the "weak links" causing production imbalance and their degree of weakness will be discovered. This will allow for the formulation of appropriate improvement measures targeted at these "weak links." For example, using templates, jigs, promoting advanced experience, conducting technical education, or adjusting equipment load, and even adjusting equipment, in order to seek comprehensive improvement in the level of the factory's production capacity. If assessment work is not carried out first, and advanced experience is simply promoted passively, it is bound to take detours. Because if improvements are not made with a clear understanding of the weaknesses, but rather advanced experience is promoted generally or even blindly in workshops or work groups with stronger capabilities, the result will be that the "weak links" become relatively weaker, which will create greater imbalances and will not benefit the overall production capacity of the factory. For example, after production reform in a machine factory in Shanghai, workers' enthusiasm was high, they looked for "tricks" and tried to find ways to adopt various advanced working methods, but because the problem of balance was not resolved, although the output of parts increased, they were not coordinated with each other, resulting in a serious phenomenon where semi-finished products accounted for 83 percent of the total production value, while finished products accounted for only 17 percent. Therefore, assessment must be carried out to find out where the weaknesses lie and promote advanced experience, so that it is possible to be planned and directional, and it is possible to achieve the effect of truly improving the factory's production capacity, and to provide a strong guarantee for carrying out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and implementing the economic accounting system.

(2) Providing standards for formulating production plans. In the past, because the factory's production capacity was unknown, the formulation of plans was mostly based on subjective imagination or one-sided experience, lacking a correct basis. After carrying out the assessment work this year, it is possible to understand how much potential capacity the factory has, and there will be a reliable guide when formulating the 1953 production plan. The fact that the production capacity calculated by a machine factory in Beijing is three times its current capacity shows that the potential capacity of enterprises is very large. After implementing various improvement measures, the production capacity can undoubtedly be improved. Therefore, as long as the measures proposed after the assessment are implemented, the planned quantity for 1953 will be greatly increased compared with the present, and the enterprise managers can have a basis and confidence to complete the plan.

(3) Making the proposed basic construction plans meet the needs. In the past, when many factories carried out basic construction, they did not consider the actual needs comprehensively enough and did not carefully analyze the equipment capacity. As a result, there were often phenomena such as the uncoordinated layout of factory buildings and machines. If the equipment in these factories could fully utilize its potential capacity, then many basic constructions would be inappropriate and unnecessary; some factories blindly build factory buildings or add equipment, which instead makes the original strong places stronger, and the original weak places weaker, which further aggravates the degree of their incoordination. The People's Daily reported on September 6 that the reason why the basic construction of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory caused serious rework, waste, and delayed construction period was because they did not know how much the existing equipment's strength had been exerted, and they did not know which machines and equipment should be added from the perspective of balancing and improving the overall productivity. In order to avoid waste in construction forces and machine supply as much as possible, the construction of each project or the addition of each machine should meet the needs. After the production capacity assessment work, this problem can be gradually solved.

The country's large-scale economic construction is about to begin, and we must change the way factories were managed in the past like handicrafts workshops. The production process and operation technology of machine and electrical appliance manufacturing factories are more complicated, so it is even more necessary to thoroughly assess the factory's production capacity, discover "weak links," change weak links, and do a good job in production plans and basic construction plans.

    新华社记者评机器工业中进行查定生产能力工作的重要意义
    新华社记者评机器工业中进行查定生产能力工作的重要意义说：旧中国机器电器制造工厂绝大多数基本上是修配厂。解放后由于广大职工的努力，已能自制多种机器，而且产量不断增高；但管理上还存在着一定程度的混乱，计划的编制常常存在着盲目性。其主要原因就是由于对工厂究竟有多大生产能力了解不够，不知道阻碍生产发展的关键何在，因而也就很难进行具体而有效的改进措施。
    苏联先进经验“生产能力查定”正是解决这一问题的有效办法，其主要作用有以下三方面：
    （一）发现工厂生产能力的薄弱环节，明确改进方向，求得生产能力水平的全面提高。在查定生产能力的过程中，将发现造成生产不均衡的“薄弱环节”及其薄弱程度。这样就可以针对这些“薄弱环节”拟定适当的改进措施。例如使用样板、卡具、推广先进经验，进行技术教育或调整设备负荷以至调整设备等等，以便求得工厂的生产能力水平的全面提高。如果不首先进行查定工作，而单纯被动地推广先进经验，就难免不走弯路。因为如果不是心中有数地针对弱点进行提高，而只是一般地甚或盲目地专在能力较强的工段或工作组大力推行先进经验，其结果就将使“薄弱环节”相对地更为薄弱，也就将造成更大的不平衡，对工厂的全盘生产能力没有补益。例如上海某机器厂生产改革后，工人热情高涨，找“窍门”想办法，采用各种先进工作方法，但由于平衡问题未解决，零件产量虽然增加了，却互不配合，以致发生半成品占生产总值的百分之八十三，而成品只占百分之十七的严重现象。因此必须进行查定，找出弱点所在，推广先进经验，才可能是有计划有方向的，也才可能收到真正提高工厂生产能力的效果，并为开展增产节约运动、贯彻经济核算制等工作提供有力的保障。
    （二）提供制定生产计划的标准。过去，因为不知道工厂的生产能力，订计划多凭主观想像或片面经验，缺乏正确根据，今年进行了查定工作，就可以了解工厂潜在能力究竟多大，编制一九五三年生产计划时就有了可靠的准绳。北京某机器厂计算出的生产能力等于现在能力的三倍的事实，说明企业的潜在能力是很大的。在施行各种改进措施后，无疑可以提高生产能力，因此，只要查定后所提出的措施都付诸实现，一九五三年的计划数量，就会比现在大大提高，而且可以使企业管理者有根据有信心完成计划。
    （三）使提出的基本建设计划切合需要。过去很多工厂进行基本建设时对实际需要考虑不够全面，没有认真地分析设备能力，因之往往出现厂房和机器不协调等现象，而如果这些工厂的设备能够充分发挥潜在能力，则很多基本建设便不恰当不需要了；有些工厂盲目地修建厂房或添置设备，反而使原来很强的地方更强，原来弱的地方显得更弱，更加重了它的不配合的程度。九月六日人民日报报道上海电机厂基本建设之所以造成严重的返工浪费并延误工期，就是由于不知道现有设备的力量究竟发挥了多少，不知道从平衡和提高整个生产力着眼应该添置那些机器设备。为了尽力避免建筑力量和机器供应上的浪费，兴建每一工程或添置每一部机器都应该切合需要。经过生产能力查定工作，就可以逐渐解决这个问题。
    国家大规模的经济建设即将开始，我们必须改变过去手工业经营管理工厂的方式。机器电器制造工厂的生产过程和作业技术比较复杂，就更需要彻底清算工厂的生产能力，发现“薄弱环节”，改变薄弱环节，做好生产计划和基本建设计划。
