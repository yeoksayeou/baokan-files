    The Night Party School in Shenyang
    Propaganda Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee
    In order to carry out the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among in-service cadres, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee opened more than 70 intermediate and primary level night party schools simultaneously in May 1951, receiving more than 26,000 Party and non-Party cadres to participate in the study. The three intermediate night party schools were directly led by the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee, and the primary night party schools were led by the Party committees of various departments. These night party schools implemented a regular academic year system, requiring all cadres participating in the study to start from the beginning, proceed step by step, and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    Based on the experience of the first academic year in 1951, night party schools have a great effect on improving the enthusiasm of in-service cadres for studying theory and their work ability. The general reaction of cadres who entered night party schools to study is: after studying, "thoughts are clarified," "understanding of the Party's policies is deepened," "scattered theories have begun to be systematized," and thus their work has also been improved. Cadres engaged in personnel work have been able to correctly implement the policy of "both virtue and talent" in their work, and have paid attention to promoting outstanding workers as leading cadres. Cadres engaged in public security work have been able to rely on the masses to carry out their work, correcting mystical views. Cadres in the enterprise sector no longer separate politics and business, and have strengthened the idea of relying on all employees to do a good job in production. On the other hand, everyone began to feel the lack of theoretical knowledge and realized the necessity of strengthening theoretical study. Those who did not participate in the study also asked to participate in the study, and no one was willing to stand outside the circle of study. Ideological problems such as "no time to study," "contradiction between study and work," and "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst" have all been resolved one by one.
    This proves that running a night party school is a good way to strengthen the theoretical study of in-service cadres. It can adapt to the characteristics of in-service cadres' work and study, and is welcomed and accepted by cadres.
    How was the night party school established?
    It is not easy to run a night party school, and it is even more difficult to run so many night party schools. The reason why Shenyang's night party school was able to be established is because of the following conditions.
    First, the emphasis and specific leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee and Party organizations at all levels. The Shenyang Municipal Committee has long regarded leading the political and theoretical study of in-service cadres as one of the main daily tasks. In 1951, the Shenyang Municipal Committee led Party organizations at all levels to specifically study the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's "Instructions on Strengthening Cadres' Marxist-Leninist Study," and formulated a specific plan for Shenyang City to implement these instructions. Party organizations at all levels conducted reviews and unanimously believed that there were two reasons why study had not been done well in the past: one was that whether it was leading personnel or general cadres, although they were willing to study, they could not escape the circle of pragmatism, so that they were busy and had no time to study. The other was that some leading personnel were satisfied with the status quo and were unwilling to study. They said: the superiors have instructions, we have experience, and cadres and the masses have enthusiasm for work, so we are not afraid of not completing work tasks! In general, everyone did not realize that strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental way to improve work.
    After studying the above situation, the Shenyang Municipal Committee stipulated that responsible Party cadres of all departments must regard leading political and theoretical study and strengthening their own political and theoretical study as one of the main daily tasks. At the same time, the Shenyang Municipal Committee and Party committees at all levels conducted in-depth study mobilizations, creating a strong atmosphere of study among all cadres, making everyone feel that "study is glorious" and "not studying is a shameful thing." Therefore, cadres asked to enter night party schools to study.
    In terms of material conditions and other aspects for running night party schools, the Shenyang Municipal Committee gave very good care. The Municipal Committee approved sufficient funds for the night party schools and made regulations on ensuring the study time of cadres.
    After the night party schools started classes, the Shenyang Municipal Committee and responsible cadres of various units personally led the study or gave lectures to the students. Jiao Ruoyu, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang Municipal People's Government, Zhang Like, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and others personally served as principals of the intermediate night party schools. Secretaries and members of the Municipal Committee served as teachers or study consultants. These responsible cadres were very serious and responsible whether they were leading studies, giving lectures, or answering questions. For example, Huang Oudong, Second Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Zhang Like, Member of the Municipal Committee, were able to make full preparations before giving lectures and explained them in conjunction with the actual thoughts of the cadres, which was well received by the students.
    Second, cadres consciously study. Judging from the cadres' enthusiastic participation in the study and the determination they expressed to study, everyone's learning consciousness is very high. On the one hand, it is because cadres have a high desire for knowledge, and on the other hand, it is also because the development of various tasks is forcing everyone to study.
    How has the night party school persisted?
    It is not easy to run a night party school, and it is even more difficult to persist.
    The experience of running a night party school in Shenyang proves that the key to persisting in running a night party school is the teacher issue, that is, there must be good teachers. With good teachers, everyone can have greater gains in their studies. In this way, everyone will have greater interest in studying and can persist in studying.
    At present, most of those who have a certain Marxist-Leninist cultivation and can give good lectures are responsible cadres at the municipal level. These responsible cadres are relatively busy with their work, and it is difficult for them to give lectures regularly. Although some of the intermediate cadres and young intellectuals selected as teachers are enthusiastic and responsible in their work, they still lack Marxist-Leninist cultivation and practical work experience, and cannot temporarily meet the requirements of studying cadres. Under such circumstances, the Shenyang Municipal Committee adopted the following two methods to solve the teacher problem.
    (1) Form a lecture group composed of responsible cadres at the municipal level to give lectures to the intermediate night party schools. At the same time, merge the night party schools with a smaller number of people into joint night party schools; and form a strong lecture group of teachers from the city's primary night party schools and uniformly assign them to various night party schools to give lectures. Because each factory, agency, and school has hired teachers, but due to different conditions in each department, the quality of teachers is also different, so this unified adjustment and allocation is necessary. In a city as large as Shenyang, with convenient transportation, there are sufficient conditions to adopt the above method.
    (2) Strengthen the study guidance work of Party organizations in various units. The Shenyang Municipal Committee has made a decision on this, requiring Party organizations in various units to regard leading the theoretical study of all cadres as one of their regular tasks, and designate one of the general branch secretaries or deputy secretaries to be specifically responsible for leading theoretical study.
    In addition, a teacher training class was held to train a group of theoretical teachers.
    Another method to make the night party school persist is to establish various learning systems - promotion, transfer, suspension, demotion, examination, graduation, and other systems. These systems can all play a role in urging everyone to persist in studying. Among them, the examination system has the greatest effect on urging study and encouraging learning enthusiasm. For example, last summer vacation, thirty or forty discussion topics were put forward, allowing everyone to spend a month doing a general review, and explaining that these topics were also test questions. As a result, when cadres were reviewing, their emotions were very tense, and the relevant reference books in the library were borrowed out. The results of this test were very good, proving that everyone's learning was hard work and that there were achievements.
    Organizational Leadership Issues of Night Party School
    Shenyang's intermediate night party schools are joint night party schools organized according to the region, the nature of cadres' work, and teacher conditions. The principal and vice-principal are concurrently held by members of the Municipal Committee, and there are special personnel to manage the daily work. The joint night party school is under the unified leadership of the Municipal Committee, and the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee conducts regular guidance. This level of night party school mainly absorbs cadres with a junior high school education or above and with basic theoretical knowledge to participate in the study. Primary night party schools are generally established on the basis of the original agencies, schools, or cultural night schools. Primary night party schools with about 300 learning cadres are independently run by district committees, factory and enterprise Party committees, and agency branches. A few units, due to limited conditions, cannot independently establish them, so they are jointly organized by units with similar regions, and the Party committees or propaganda departments of each unit conduct regular guidance. This level of night party school mainly absorbs lower-level cadres from various units to participate in the study.
    Both intermediate and primary night party schools have a principal, a director of teaching, and a secretary, one each, and deputy positions are set up when necessary. The principals of primary night party schools are concurrently held by responsible cadres of various units (Party committee secretary or propaganda minister), and the directors of teaching and secretaries are part-time except for a few units with full-time cadres. But to do a good job in the night party school, there must be two or three full-time responsible cadres.
    The academic year system for intermediate and primary night party schools adopts the Soviet method, starting in March and ending in October each year. Each academic year conducts eight months of study, and the remaining four months are for vacation and review, testing, and preparation for the start of the second academic year.

    沈阳市的夜党校
    中共沈阳市委宣传部
    中共沈阳市委会为了在在职干部中开展马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的学习，曾于一九五一年五月，同时开办了中、初两级夜党校七十余所，接收了两万六千余名党和非党干部参加学习。其中的三所中级夜党校，由沈阳市委宣传部直接领导，初级夜党校由各部门党委领导。这些夜党校实行正规学年制，要求所有参加学习的干部，从头学起，循序渐进，系统地进行马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的学习。
    根据一九五一年第一学年试办的经验，夜党校对于提高在职干部学习理论的热情和工作能力都有很大的作用。入夜党校学习的干部，普遍的反应是：经过学习“思想明确了”，“对党的政策领会深刻了”，“零星的理论开始系统化了”，因而也改进了自己的工作。作人事工作的干部已能在工作中正确地贯彻“德才兼备”的方针，并注意了提拔工人中的优秀分子作领导干部。作公安工作的干部，已能依靠群众进行工作，纠正了神秘化观点。企业部门的干部，不再把政治和业务分割开来，加强了依靠全体职工搞好生产的思想。另一方面，大家开始感到理论知识的贫乏，并认识到加强理论学习的必要。未参加学习的人也要求参加学习了，再没有一个人愿意站在学习的圈子外边。“没有时间学习”“学习和工作矛盾”“远水解不了近渴”等等的思想问题，都一一解决。
    由此证明，办夜党校是加强在职干部理论学习的好方法。它是能够适应在职干部工作、学习的特点，并为干部所欢迎和接受的。
    夜党校是怎样办起来的
    办一个夜党校是不容易的，办这么多的夜党校更不容易。沈阳市的夜党校所以能够办起来，是因为有下述条件。
    第一，沈阳市委及各级党组织的重视和具体领导。沈阳市委早已把领导在职干部的政治理论学习作为日常主要工作之一。在一九五一年，沈阳市委就领导各级党组织专门研究了中共中央东北局“关于加强干部马克思列宁主义学习”的指示，而且制订了沈阳市执行这一指示的具体方案。各级党的组织又进行了检讨，一致认为过去没有把学习搞好有两种原因：一种是不论领导人员或一般干部虽然都愿意学习，但跳不出事务主义的圈子，以致忙忙碌碌，没有时间学习。一种是有些领导人员满足于现状，不愿学习。他们说：上级有指示，自己有经验，干部、群众有工作热情，工作任务还怕完不成！总起来说，大家没有认识到加强马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的学习，是提高工作的根本方法。
    沈阳市委在研究了上述情况后，规定各部门党的负责干部必须把领导政治理论学习和加强本身的政治理论学习作为日常主要工作之一。同时沈阳市委和各级党委进行了深入的学习动员，在全体干部中造成了浓厚的学习空气，使大家感到“学习是光荣的”“不学习是不光彩的事情”。所以干部纷纷要求入夜党校学习。
    在开办夜党校的物质条件方面以及其他方面，沈阳市委都给了很好的照顾。市委为夜党校批准了足够的经费，并作出了关于保证干部学习时间的规定。
    夜党校开课以后，沈阳市委和各单位负责干部，亲自领导学习或给学员讲课。沈阳市人民政府副市长焦若愚、市总工会主席张力克等都亲自兼任中级夜党校的校长。市委书记、市委委员等都担任了教员或学习顾问。这些负责干部无论是领导学习、讲课和解答问题，都非常认真负责。例如市委第二副书记黄欧东、市委委员张力克，都能在讲课之前作充分准备，讲解时结合干部思想实际，因而深得学员的好评。
    第二，干部的自觉学习。从干部踊跃参加学习和所表示的学习决心来看，大家的学习自觉性很高。这一方面是因为干部有了很高的求知欲，一方面也是因为各种工作的发展，强迫着大家学习。
    夜党校是怎样坚持下来的
    办夜党校不容易，坚持下来更不容易。
    沈阳市办夜党校的经验证明：要把夜党校坚持办下来，关键是教员问题，也就是要有好教员。有了好教员，大家在学习上才能有更大的收获，这样，大家对学习才有更大的兴趣，才能坚持学习。
    目前，有一定的马克思列宁主义修养，并能讲好课的，大多是市级负责干部。这些负责干部的工作比较忙，要他们经常讲课是有困难的。而所选聘的一部分中级干部和青年知识分子教员，虽然在工作上热情负责，但他们还缺乏马克思列宁主义的修养和实际工作经验，暂时还不能满足学习干部的要求。在这种情况下，沈阳市委采取了以下两种办法，来解决教员问题。
    （一）将担任讲课的市级负责干部组成讲师团，给中级夜党校讲课。同时，将人数较少的夜党校合并为联合夜党校；又将全市初级夜党校的教员组成一个强大的讲师团，统一分配到各夜党校讲课。因为各工厂、机关、学校，虽然都聘有教员，但由于各部门条件不同，教员质量也不同，所以，这种统一调整、分配是必要的。像沈阳市这样大的城市，交通方便，完全有条件采用上述的办法。
    （二）加强各单位的党组织的学习辅导工作。沈阳市委曾为此作出决定，要各单位的党组织把领导全体干部的理论学习当作经常工作之一，并指定在总支书记、副书记中，必须有一人专门负责领导理论学习。
    此外，办教员训练班，训练了一批理论教员。
    使夜党校坚持下来的另一个方法，就是建立各项学习制度——升学、转学、休学、降级、考试、毕业等制度。这些制度，都能起督促大家坚持学习的作用。其中以考试制度对督促学习、鼓舞学习情绪的作用最大。比如去年暑期，就出了三四十个讨论题，让大家用一个月时间进行总复习，并说明这些题也就是测验题。结果，干部在进行复习时，情绪都非常紧张，图书馆里的有关参考书被借一空。这次测验的结果很好，证明了大家的学习是努力的，也是有成绩的。
    夜党校的组织领导问题
    沈阳市的中级夜党校是根据区域和干部的工作性质、教员等条件组织的联合性夜党校。校长、副校长由市委委员兼任，并有专人管理经常工作。联合夜党校由市委统一领导，市委宣传部进行经常指导。这一级夜党校主要是吸收初中以上文化程度，并具有基础理论知识的干部参加学习。初级夜党校一般是在原机关学校或文化夜校的基础上建立的。学习干部在三百名左右的初级夜党校由各区委、工厂企业党委、机关支部独立开办。少数单位由于条件的限制，不能独立创办，就由区域相近的单位联合举办，由各单位党委或党委宣传部门进行经常指导。这一级夜党校主要吸收各单位的下级干部参加学习。
    中、初两级夜党校均设校长、教导主任、秘书各一人，必要时设副职。初级夜党校校长由各单位负责干部（党委书记或宣传部长）兼任，教导主任、秘书，除少数单位有专职干部外，均为兼职。但要搞好夜党校，必须设有两三专职负责干部。
    中、初两级夜党校的学年制，是采用苏联的办法，每年三月份开始，到十月结束。每学年共进行八个月的学习，其余四个月是休假和复习、测验，并进行第二个学年开始的准备工作。
