Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 2nd: September 3rd marks the seventh anniversary of Japan's surrender. For seven years, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese people have unswervingly fought against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to demand the realization of the peace, democracy, and independence guaranteed to them by the Potsdam Proclamation. The signing and entry into force of the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan, which aims to enslave the Japanese people, has aroused even more激昂 resistance from the Japanese people. They resolutely oppose the United States turning Japan into a U.S. military base and a supplier of cannon fodder.

According to the U.S.-Japan military base agreement signed on July 26, the Yoshida government will continue to provide the United States with a total of 603 barracks, military training grounds, and military bases. The Japanese people oppose the construction of military bases by the U.S. occupiers through various means such as gatherings, demonstrations, and protests. In Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture, the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, in order to expand the local air force base, planned to fill in the laver cultivation farms of Japanese fishermen near the base. The fishermen immediately rose up in resistance, and the Japanese Communist Party branch strongly supported the fishermen's struggle. The fishermen held meetings, published wall newspapers, and distributed leaflets, resolutely protesting the expansion of the base. As a result of the struggle, the U.S. military authorities had to cancel the plan to expand the base. Now, the people of Kisarazu are continuing to demand the removal of existing bases to prevent future troubles. The same thing happened in Nara, the famous ancient capital of Japan. The U.S.-Japan Joint Committee had decided to build a U.S. air force base near Nara. After the news spread, the people of the whole city rose up in opposition, and lodged strong protests to the Yoshida government, even forcing the Ministry of Education to express its opposition to the plan. Under these circumstances, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries had to announce the abandonment of the original plan.

The struggle of the Japanese people has also seriously hindered the U.S. plan to use Japan as a training base. Farmers, fishermen, and urban residents unanimously resisted military exercises that endanger people's safety and create a war atmosphere. The coastal area of ​​Hokkaido, Monbetsu-cho, was originally designated as a U.S. military training ground. The local people persisted in a four-month struggle to oppose this plan. The U.S. occupying forces even dispatched tanks to threaten them, but it did not shake the people's will to fight. Finally, they were forced to cancel the exercise plan and withdrew from Monbetsu-cho. In late July, the U.S. military stationed in Japan held air defense exercises throughout Japan, forcibly ordering the Japanese people to "cooperate" and "assist." During the exercise, people in various places took practical actions to resist. They held demonstrations, refused to "cooperate," and protested against the blackout, which finally led to the failure of the exercise.

The Japanese people are also determined to oppose serving as cannon fodder for the U.S. aggressors. They are stopping the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to restore the Japanese conscription system. The number of people signing the declaration against conscription is increasing day by day. According to extremely incomplete materials, the number of signatories has already exceeded 380,000. In order to prepare for the restoration of conscription, the Yoshida government held a "resident registration" in early July. This measure has always been opposed and condemned by the people of the whole country. Collective refusal to register is extremely common. All 637 households on one street in Hinomachi, Matsusaka City, Mie Prefecture, refused to register, and all 12 census takers in the city resigned because they opposed the census. The city council and town council of Kushiro City and Kamikawa Town in Hokkaido unanimously resolved to return the census business. Student dormitories in universities across the country have successively resolved to oppose registration. Students in Tokyo held a meeting and demonstration, and burned thousands of household registration forms on the spot.

The Japanese people's resolute struggle against serving as U.S. cannon fodder has seriously hit the Yoshida government's plan to recruit so-called "Police Reserve Force" members. The Yoshida government originally decided to increase the "Police Reserve Force" from 75,000 to 110,000 this year. However, recruitment work encountered difficulties from the beginning. Young people in many places gathered to decide not to participate in the "Police Reserve Force" and burned the recruitment brochures. Few people applied in various places. For example, Sakata City and 饱海 City originally planned to recruit 300 people, but only 32 people actually applied. The number of applicants in the Murayama area of ​​Yamagata Prefecture decreased by more than two-thirds compared to the last time. Many young people who were initially deceived into taking the Police Reserve Force exam are also constantly waking up and resolutely withdrawing. For example, after the news that 1,000 members of the "Police Reserve Force" in Sagamihara, Gunma Prefecture, were sent to the Korean front line spread, some rural youths tore up the admission notices they received from the "Police Reserve Force" and were unwilling to fall into the trap. Now the "Police Reserve Force" is again busy recruiting another 27,000 people to fill the vacancies of retirees, but by the near the registration deadline, there were only more than 14,000 applicants in total.

Under the heavy blows of the Japanese people, the Yoshida government, which faithfully implements the U.S. policy of reviving Japanese militarism, has been unable to continue its rule. It has been forced to announce the dissolution of the House of Representatives and hold early general elections. The Japanese Communist Party has called on the Japanese people to further crack down on the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to revive Japanese militarism in the general election struggle. There is no doubt that the Japanese people will achieve greater victories in the new struggle.

### 日本人民在日本共产党的领导下  英勇反对美国复活日本军国主义

    日本人民在日本共产党的领导下
    英勇反对美国复活日本军国主义
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：九月三日是日本投降七周年纪念日。七年以来，日本人民在日本共产党的领导下，为了要求实现波茨坦公告对日本人民所保证的和平、民主与独立，始终不渝地对美日反动派进行着英勇的斗争。以奴役日本人民为目的的美国单独对日和约的签订和生效，激起了日本人民更加激昂的反抗。他们坚决反对美国变日本为美国的军事基地和炮灰供应地。
    根据七月二十六日签订的美日军事基地协定，吉田政府将继续向美国提供营房、军事演习场、军事基地等共六百零三处。日本人民通过集会、示威、抗议等种种方式，反对美国占领者修建军事基地。在千叶县木更津，美国远东空军司令部为了扩大当地的空军基地，准备填掉基地附近的日本渔民的紫菜养殖场。渔民们立即起来反抗，日本共产党支部大力支援渔民的斗争。渔民们召开大会，出版墙报和散发传单，坚决抗议扩大基地。斗争的结果，美军当局不得不取消了扩大基地的计划。现在，木更津的人民正在继续要求撤除已有的基地，以除后患。同样的事例也发生在日本著名的故都奈良。美日联合委员会曾经决定在奈良附近修建一个美国空军基地。消息传出之后，全市人民群起反对，向吉田政府提出了强烈的抗议，甚至迫使文部省（教育部）都不得不也表示反对这个计划。在这种情况之下，美、日反动派只得宣布放弃原来的计划。
    日本人民的斗争也使美国利用日本为训练基地的计划受到严重的阻碍。农民、渔民和城市居民一致反抗危害人民安全和制造战争气氛的军事演习。北海道的沿海地区的门别町原被划为美军的演习场。当地人民坚持了四个月的斗争，反对这个计划。美国占领军甚至出动坦克进行威胁，但丝毫未能动摇人民的斗争意志，终于被迫取消了演习计划，并且退出了门别町。在七月下旬，驻日美军在日本全国范围内举行防空演习，强令日本人民“合作”和“协助”。在演习期间，各地人民采取实际行动进行抵制。他们举行示威，拒绝“合作”，抗议灯火管制，终于使演习宣告失败。
    日本人民也坚决反对替美国侵略者充当炮灰。他们正在制止着美、日反动派恢复日本征兵制度的阴谋。在反对征兵宣言上签名的人，一天比一天增加。根据极不完全的材料，签名者早已超过三十八万人。吉田政府为了准备恢复征兵制，曾经在七月初举行一次“居民登记”。这个措施始终受到全国人民的反对和斥责。集体拒绝登记的事情极为普遍。三重县松坂市日野町的一条街的六百三十七户居民全体拒绝登记，该市的户口登记调查员十二人也因反对户口登记而全体辞职。北海道钏路市和上川町两地的市议会与町议会一致决议退回有关户口登记的业务。各地大学的学生宿舍，纷纷决议反对登记。东京的学生并且举行大会和示威，当场烧毁了数千张户口登记表。
    日本人民反对充当美国炮灰的坚决的斗争，严重地打击了吉田政府招募所谓“警察后备队”队员的计划。吉田政府原决定在今年将“警察后备队”从七万五千人增加到十一万人。但是，招募的工作一开始就遭到了困难。许多地方的青年都集会决定不参加“警察后备队”，并且把招募说明书烧毁。各地应募者稀零冷落。例如，酒田市和饱海市原来计划招募三百人，但实际上报名的只有三十二人。山形县村山地方的应募者比上次减少了三分之二以上。许多最初受骗去投考警察后备队的青年，也不断觉醒起来，毅然退出。例如，在群马县相模原的“警察后备队”一千人被派往朝鲜前线的消息传出之后，有些农村青年就把他们所接到的“警察后备队”的录取通知撕毁了，不愿陷入罗网。现在“警察后备队”又在四出张罗，招募另外二万七千人来填补退役者的缺额，而到将近报名截止的日期时，应募者总共不过一万四千多人。
    在日本人民的沉重打击下，忠实执行美国复活日本军国主义政策的吉田政府，已经无法继续维持它的统治。它已被迫宣布解散众院、提前举行大选。日本共产党已经号召日本人民在大选斗争中进一步打击美日反动派复活日本军国主义的阴谋。毫无疑问，日本人民在新的斗争中将获得更大的胜利。
