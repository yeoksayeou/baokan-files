Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: TASS Moscow, September 13th: "Pravda" today published a talk by Park Jung-ai, Vice-Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, when she met with the newspaper's reporter, Dekachenko. Park Jung-ai stated that she hoped the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference would establish and implement effective measures to immediately ban inhumane bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and napalm bombs, and to stop the atrocities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. She also hoped it would take necessary steps to promote a ceasefire in Korea, withdraw all foreign troops from Asian and Pacific countries, and pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Far East issue.

After emphasizing that the revival of Japanese militarism is the greatest threat to the people of Asian countries, Park Jung-ai said that the Peace Conference cannot ignore the shameless rule of the American imperialists in Japan, which has caused great suffering to the Japanese people and threatens the independent survival of other Far Eastern countries.

Park Jung-ai described the preparations of the Korean people to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, saying that in late August and early September, meetings and gatherings of peace fighters were held in all provinces, counties, townships, cities, and villages of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They discussed the resolutions of the special session of the World Peace Council, the preparatory meetings held for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and the organizational work of local peace committees among the masses under the new circumstances caused by American bombers forcing people to hide in the mountains and forests.

Park Jung-ai said that despite the cruel terror and persecution by the American occupation authorities and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, the struggle for peace is being carried out in South Korea, including Geoje Island and Jeju Island.

Park Jung-ai then pointed out that the American aggressors want to destroy all cities and villages of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. She said that the American generals say they ordered the destruction of seventy-eight North Korean cities, but they are lying. American planes indiscriminately burn and destroy everything—whether it is a city or a village, a small hut in the mountains or a pasture... This order conceals the heinous plan of the American imperialists—the plan to completely eliminate the Korean people. This is the most heinous crime of the aggressors, but we are confident that the misanthropic plan of the American colonialists will be defeated. Our people, with the active support of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, have enough strength to defeat any conspiracy of the enemy and give them corresponding retaliation.

    朴正爱对苏联“真理报”记者发表谈话
    希望和平会议订出有效措施制止美军暴行
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：“真理报”今日刊载了朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长朴正爱在接见该报记者德卡诚科时发表的谈话。朴正爱表示，她希望即将举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议能够订出并且实施关于立即禁止非人道的细菌武器、化学武器和凝固汽油弹以及停止对朝、中被俘人员施以暴行的有效措施，并能采取必要步骤来促使达成朝鲜停战、使所有外国军队从亚洲和太平洋区域国家撤出，以及为和平解决远东问题铺平道路。
    朴正爱在强调指出日本军国主义的复活是对亚洲各国人民最大的威胁之后说，和平会议不能忽视美帝国主义者在日本的无耻统治，他们使日本人民受到很大的苦难，并威胁了其他远东国家的独立生存。
    朴正爱描述朝鲜人民筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的情况说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的各道、郡、面、城市和乡村，在八月下旬和九月上旬，都举行了和平战士的会议和集会，讨论了世界和平理事会特别会议的决议，讨论了为召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而举行的筹备会议以及各地和平委员会在新情况下在群众中进行组织工作的问题，这种新情况是由于美国轰炸机迫使人民躲藏在山中和森林中而产生的。
    朴正爱说，尽管美国占领当局和李承晚卖国匪帮采取残忍的恐怖手段和迫害手段，争取和平的斗争正在南朝鲜进行着，包括巨济岛和济州岛在内。
    朴正爱接着指出，美国侵略者想要毁灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一切城市和乡村。她说，美国将军们说，他们下令毁灭七十八个北朝鲜城市，他们是在说谎。美国飞机不分青红皂白地焚毁并破坏一切东西——不论是一个城市或者一个乡村，山林中的一间小茅屋或者一个牧场……这个命令掩饰了美帝国主义者的罪大恶极的计划——彻底消灭朝鲜人民的计划。这是侵略者的最可恶的罪行，但是我们确信美国殖民者的仇恨人类的计划必将遭到挫败。得到英勇的中国人民志愿军积极支持的我国人民，是有足够力量挫败敌人的任何阴谋并给予他们相应的报复的。
