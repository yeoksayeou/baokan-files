Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 3rd: In the last six days of August, the Korean front experienced continuous rain, and the Chinese and Korean People's Army braved the rain to fiercely attack the invading enemy forces. On the 27th, two enemy companies attacked Height 572.4 east of the North Han River. After eleven consecutive assaults, they were repelled by our army, resulting in 152 enemy casualties. On the same night, a forward detachment of our army encountered two enemy squads southwest of Kimhwa. After a ten-minute battle, the entire enemy force was annihilated. On the 30th, an enemy company infiltrated an area south of Shangpu Defense, west of Tieyuan. Its leading squad was ambushed by our forces and completely wiped out with intense fire. The remaining enemies attacked forward but were still repelled by our ambush forces. The enemy suffered 35 casualties. On the same night, an enemy company infiltrated an area southeast of Mundung-ri and was severely attacked by our forward detachment, suffering over 40 casualties. Simultaneously, a crack night raid team of our army suddenly attacked an enemy position more than ten kilometers east of Mundung-ri, using hand grenades to annihilate an entire enemy platoon hiding in bunkers. On the 30th, more than 70 enemies in wooden boats, under the cover of aircraft, attempted to land and harass the Ongjin Peninsula in the West Sea, but were immediately repelled by our coastal defense forces. According to incomplete statistics for the last six days of August, our front-line artillery fire killed or wounded more than 1,600 enemy soldiers and destroyed or damaged 19 enemy tanks and 16 vehicles.
