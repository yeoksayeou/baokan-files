People's Bank institutions across the country, in order to meet the savings needs of people from all walks of life, have vigorously launched savings business after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. According to statistics from eight major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, the total savings in June this year increased by 120% compared to the same period last year. Among them, current monetary deposits increased by 35.4%; fixed deposits increased by 227.9%; fixed-amount deposits increased by 317.9%; and prize-winning savings increased by 102.3%. Capital-guaranteed and value-preserved savings decreased by 30.11% due to stable prices. The increase in monetary deposits and fixed deposits indicates that the savings business is developing in a healthier direction. The huge amount of funds accumulated through savings has become an important force in developing national industrial and agricultural production.

People's Banks in various regions have combined local specific conditions to carry out patriotic savings campaigns and have created many scientific working methods. People's Banks in Shanxi and Chahar and other places have organized savings mobile teams and factory and mining work teams to go deep into factories and mines to directly serve the vast number of workers and staff; they have also improved the work system and simplified savings procedures, which have been welcomed by the vast number of workers and staff. In June, the People's Banks in Suzhou, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang in Southern Jiangsu cooperated with the spring cocoon purchasing work to mobilize farmers to save, absorbing 25 billion yuan in savings deposits. In July, the Shanghai Branch selected five grassroots institutions to conduct typical experiments, adjusting business hours so that the masses had adequate time to go to the bank to save, expanding the amount of savings.

In the process of rapid development of the savings business, compulsory orders have occurred in some areas. For example, cadres in Xinmi Township, Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, stipulated that every family with a silkworm seed paper must deposit 80,000 yuan in fixed-amount monetary savings and 20,000 yuan in prize-winning savings, which aroused public dissatisfaction. It is even more wrong for cadres in Xiaoyaozi Village, Sanqu District, Huaian County, Chahar Province, to force the masses to save by using the method of not adjourning the meeting until savings are deposited. This phenomenon of compulsory orders has attracted the attention of relevant leading organs in various regions, and is being vigorously corrected. All regions must further strengthen leadership over savings work to facilitate the smooth development of the savings business. (Nan Xinzhou)

    全国各地人民银行大力开展储蓄业务
    八大城市今年六月份的储蓄总额比去年同期增加一倍多
    全国各地人民银行机构为适应各阶层人民节约储蓄的要求，在“三反”“五反”运动后大力展开储蓄业务。据北京、天津、上海、南京、重庆、西安、武汉、广州八大城市统计，今年六月份的储蓄总额比去年同期增加了百分之一百二十。其中货币活期存款增加了百分之三十五点四；定期存款增加了百分之二百二十七点九；定额存款增加了百分之三百一十七点九；有奖储蓄增加了百分之一百零二点三。保本保值储蓄则因物价稳定，减少了百分之三十点一一。货币存款与定期存款的增加，说明了储蓄业务正向更加健康的方向发展。通过储蓄所积聚的庞大的资金，已成为发展国家工农业生产的重要力量。
    各地人民银行结合当地具体情况，开展爱国储蓄运动，创造了许多科学的工作方法。山西、察哈尔等地人民银行组织了储蓄巡回小组和厂矿工作组，深入工厂矿山，直接为广大职工服务；并且改进了工作制度，简化了储蓄的手续，获得广大职工的欢迎。苏南苏州、常州、镇江三地的人民银行在六月份配合收购春茧工作，发动农民储蓄，吸收储蓄存款达二百五十亿元。上海分行在七月份选择五个基层机构进行典型试验，调整了营业时间，使群众有适当的时间到银行来储蓄，扩大了储蓄额。
    在储蓄业务迅速发展的过程中，某些地区曾经发生强迫命令的现象。例如，浙江省德清县新米乡的干部规定凡有一张蚕种纸的家庭，都要存货币定额储蓄八万元，有奖储蓄二万元，引起群众不满。察哈尔省怀安县三区小要子水村干部用不存款不散会的办法，强使群众储蓄，更是错误的。这种强迫命令的现象已引起各地有关领导机关的注意，正大力纠正中。各地必须进一步加强对储蓄工作的领导，以利储蓄业务的顺利开展。（南新宙）
