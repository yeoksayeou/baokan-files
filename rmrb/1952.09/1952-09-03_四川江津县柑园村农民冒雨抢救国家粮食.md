    Farmers of Ganyuan Village, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province Brave the Rain to Rescue National Grain
    On May 15th, boatmen Huang Zuquan and Gong Guoliang from the Jiangjin Branch of the China Grain Company’s transport team were carrying 26,000 jin of broken rice from Longmen Township, Jiangjin County, to the county seat. In the evening, as the boat approached Tangbatuo in the Chengguan District of Jiangjin County, it suddenly encountered a rainstorm. The boat tossed and turned in the strong winds and waves, and the situation became very dangerous. The boatmen prepared to bring the boat ashore at Tangbatuo, but the wind and waves pushed the boat about two zhang away from the opposite bank. The boat was gradually sinking.
    The shore was the boundary of the third neighborhood of Ganyuan Village, Shuangshi Township. The farmers were draining water to fight the drought. When they saw the grain boat about to sink, they immediately put down their buckets and rushed to rescue it. Farmers Chen Zhiyun, Chen Guilin, and others jumped into the water and tied the boat with rattan poles; the remaining dozens of farmers pulled the boat from the center of the river to the bank. Xie Xiaoyun, the chairman of the village farmers’ association, and Tang Shaowen, the village head, mobilized the village's farmers to bring baskets and other tools to salvage the broken rice that had already sunk into the water. The rain was heavy, and over a hundred male and female peasant brothers and sisters braved the rain to salvage the state's grain. It was getting dark, but the broken rice had not yet been completely salvaged. At night, the village's militia members voluntarily came to guard the grain.
    The next day, although the peasant brothers of Ganyuan Village were busy irrigating and plowing the fields, dozens of people came early in the morning to salvage the grain, and finally salvaged all of it.
    Afterwards, the Jiangjin Branch of the China Grain Company wanted to pay the peasant brothers wages and food expenses for salvaging the grain. The peasant brothers declined. They said, "We salvaged the grain to prevent the loss of state property. This is what we should do." Yang Wenxue (attached picture)

    四川江津县柑园村农民冒雨抢救国家粮食
    五月十五日，中国粮食公司江津分公司接运小组船户黄祖全、龚国良从江津县龙门乡承运碛米二万六千斤到县城去。傍晚，船将到江津城关区汤粑沱时，突然遇到了暴风雨。船在狂风急浪中颠簸，情况非常危险。船户们准备把船往汤粑沱靠岸，但风浪却把船刮到离对岸二丈左右的地方。船已经在逐渐下沉了。
    沿岸，是双石乡柑园村第三邻的地界。农民们正在排水抗旱。他们看到了即将沉没的粮船，立刻放下水桶，赶来抢救。农民陈致云、陈桂林等跳下水去，用千籐竿把船系住；其余几十个农民把船从河心拉到岸边。该村农会主任谢孝云、村长唐绍文又动员了村里的农民，带了箩筐等用具，来打捞已经沉在水中的碛米。雨下得很大，一百多个男女农民弟兄冒雨下水抢救国家的粮食。天黑了，碛米还没有捞完。夜里，村里的武装队员自动来站岗看守粮食。
    第二天，柑园村农民弟兄虽然忙着灌水犁田，但一清早就有几十个人来抢救粮食，终于把全部粮食打捞上来了。
    事后，中国粮食公司江津分公司要付给农民弟兄们打捞粮食的工资和伙食费。农民弟兄们谢绝了。他们说：“我们打捞粮食，是为了不让国家财产受损失。这是我们应该做的事。”  杨文学（附图片）
