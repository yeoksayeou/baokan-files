Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 8th: TASS reported from Washington on September 7th: On September 5th, US President Truman issued an executive order establishing the "War Criminal Clemency and Parole Board." The function of this body is to conduct necessary investigations into cases where "the United States government, based on the recommendations of the Japanese government, needs to make decisions regarding clemency, commutation, or parole concerning the judgments of Japanese war criminals by tribunals established by the United States government or the International Military Tribunal for the Far East," and to provide advice to the US President.

This new decision by the US government flagrantly violates the Potsdam Proclamation, the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and other international agreements concerning Japan. After Truman issued this order, the Japanese government will release war criminals on an even larger scale and ahead of schedule. It is quite obvious that the purpose of this decision by Washington is to revive Japanese militarism as quickly as possible.

    美国非法成立释放日战犯机构
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿七日讯：九月五日，美国总统杜鲁门发表一项行政命令，成立“战犯宽赦假释局”。这个机构的职务是就“需要美国政府根据日本政府的建议对美国政府成立的法庭或远东国际军事法庭关于日本战犯的判决作出宽赦、减刑或假释的决定”的案件进行必要的调查，并向美国总统提供意见。
    美国政府的这个新决定，穷凶极恶地违反了波茨坦公告、远东委员会的决定及其他关于日本的国际协定。在杜鲁门颁布这个命令以后，日本政府将更加大规模地提前释放战犯。十分显然，华盛顿的这个决定的目的在于尽快地复活日本军国主义。
