    Kong Lingduo Mutual Aid Team in Xiaogaozhuang Village, Bo'ai, Pingyuan, Leads Farmers in Pressing Green Manure
    Editor: The Kong Lingduo Mutual Aid Team in Xiaogaozhuang Village, Bo'ai County, Pingyuan Province, actively presses green manure, promoting a village-wide green manure pressing campaign. The Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office has specifically issued a circular commending and introducing their methods.
    Farmers in Xiaogaozhuang Village previously had no habit of pressing green manure, nor did they have any experience in doing so. They didn't understand the benefits of using green manure and were afraid of wasting their efforts if they didn't press it properly. Kong Lingduo first worked to unify the thinking of the team members within his group and took the lead in taking action. He used practical examples to motivate other mutual aid teams to carry out the green manure pressing campaign. Their methods for carrying out the green manure pressing campaign are: (1) Using existing examples to illustrate the benefits of using green manure. Last year, Ren Mingshan, a farmer in this village, put northern melon vines in the field, and not only did the corn grow particularly well that year, but this year's winter wheat also grew better than others, which shows that applying green manure can increase soil fertility. (2) Using specific accounting methods to illustrate that pressing green manure is more economical than buying fertilizer. The source of green manure is wormwood, leaves, melon vines, etc., which do not cost money to buy. Only three man-days are needed to press 5,000 jin of green manure, and its fertilizer effect is equivalent to 100 jin of soybean cake. (3) Strengthen technical guidance and implement reasonable division of labor. They invited comrades from the local farm to teach advanced green manure pressing techniques: 6,000 jin of grass can be pressed in a pit one zhang square and three chi deep; spread a layer of grass, pad a layer of soil, and stack it to a height of one chi and five cun; pour thirty dan of water; in seven to ten days, 20,000 jin of green manure can be pressed. However, pressing green manure should not delay the work of planting vegetables and watering the fields. Therefore, the mutual aid team divided the work specifically according to the team members' strengths, so that neither was neglected.
    With unified thinking and concrete methods, the four mutual aid teams in the village launched a green manure pressing competition. Now the four teams have pressed a total of 490,000 jin of green manure. Xin Zhanshu

    平原博爱小高庄村孔令铎互助组带动农民压绿肥
    编辑同志：平原博爱县小高庄村孔令铎互助组积极压绿肥，推动了全村的压绿肥竞赛运动。新乡专署特地通报表扬和介绍他们的作法。
    小高庄村农民过去没有压绿肥的习惯，也没有压绿肥的经验。他们不懂得用绿肥的好处，又怕压不好白费力气。孔令铎先在组内打通组员的思想，带头行动起来。用事实带动其他互助组开展了压绿肥运动。他们开展压绿肥运动的办法是：（一）以现有的事例说明用绿肥的好处。去年这村的农民任明山把北瓜秧放在地里，不但当年的玉米长的特别好，就是今年的冬小麦也长得比别人的都好，这说明施绿肥能增加地力。（二）用具体算账办法说明压绿肥比买肥料经济。绿肥的来源是蒿草、树叶、瓜秧等等，不用花钱去买。只用三个人工就能压五千斤绿肥，其肥效等于一百斤豆饼。（三）加强技术指导，实行合理分工。请当地农场的同志教授压绿肥的先进技术：在一丈见方、三尺深的坑内，可压六千斤草；铺一层草，垫一层土，叠至一尺五寸高；浇三十担水；在七天到十天的时间里，能压出两万斤绿肥。但压绿肥也不能耽误了种菜、浇地的工作，因此，互助组根据组员特长，具体分了工，两样都不误。
    打通了思想，又有了具体的办法，村里四个互助组展开了压绿肥竞赛。现在四个组已经压成四十九万斤绿肥。  辛展树
