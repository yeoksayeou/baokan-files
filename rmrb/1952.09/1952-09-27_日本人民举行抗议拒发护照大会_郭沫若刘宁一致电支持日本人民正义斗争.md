Xinhua News Agency, September 26th:

    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, sent a telegram to the Japanese People's Rally Protesting Passport Refusals, expressing concern and support for the just struggle of the Japanese people, and protesting the unreasonable behavior of the Japanese Yoshida government in refusing to issue passports and assaulting peace representatives. The telegram reads as follows:
    To Mr. Hatanaka Masaharu, of the Committee for the Struggle to Obtain Passports for Japanese Representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and forwarded to the Japanese People's Rally Protesting Passport Refusals:
    On behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese people, I express my deep concern and support for your just struggle, and protest the Japanese government's refusal to issue passports and its instigation of thugs to assault Japanese representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    The atrocities of the Japanese government demonstrate that a small number of militarist elements headed by Shigeru Yoshida, with the support of the American occupiers, are attempting to revive the bankrupt aggression of the Tojo Hideki generation. Therefore, it hates peace, opposes the good wishes of the Japanese people for peace, and even resorts to base and despicable hooligan tactics to obstruct and prohibit Japanese peace representatives from participating in peace conferences. This situation makes the Chinese people and the people of other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, who have long suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression, as well as the Japanese people, equally vigilant: Firmly stopping the revival of Japanese militarism has become a pressing task in the cause of safeguarding peace in the Asian and Pacific regions.
    We know that any atrocities and persecutions by the Japanese government cannot shake the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. Regardless of the obstruction of the reactionaries, the Japanese people's peace representatives continue to fight for passports to go abroad. This indomitable spirit shows that the Japanese people are determined to jointly shoulder the sacred task of safeguarding peace with the people of other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. The Chinese people fully sympathize with and support the Japanese people's struggle. We believe that the people of other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions will also unanimously express sympathy and support. I would like to reiterate a sentence from my second open letter to the Japanese people, written on September 5:
    "No matter what difficulties your struggle may encounter, the support of the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions for you will not change, but will only increase their efforts to support your struggle."
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace

    Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, recently sent a telegram to the Japanese People's Rally Protesting Passport Refusals, scheduled to be held in Tokyo on the 27th, supporting the Japanese people's just struggle. The telegram reads as follows:
    To Mr. Hatanaka Masaharu, of the Committee for the Struggle to Obtain Passports for Japanese Representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and forwarded to the Japanese People's Rally Protesting Passport Refusals:
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to be held, and the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions eagerly hope that all Japanese peace representatives will be able to attend this significant conference. However, the Japanese Yoshida government, at the instigation of the American occupiers, has refused to issue passports to Japanese peace representatives and has openly directed fascist thugs to commit violent assaults. This crime of the Japanese government in opposing peace and undermining the peace movement will inevitably be opposed and severely condemned by all peace-loving people in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. On behalf of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, I would like to express my deep condolences to the Japanese peace representatives, express my warm support for the protest rally held by the Japanese people in Tokyo, express my highest respect to the Japanese people who are bravely fighting for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy, and express my most serious protest to the Japanese government.
    Opposing the remilitarization of Japan and safeguarding peace in the Asian and Pacific regions will be the central theme of this conference. The Japanese people's united struggle against the remilitarization of Japan and for national independence, peace, and democracy is of great significance for safeguarding peace in the Asian and Pacific regions and world peace, and will therefore receive sufficient attention at this conference. Even if the Japanese government can prevent all Japanese peace representatives from attending the conference, it cannot stop the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy, let alone prevent the increasingly close unity between the people of the Asian and Pacific countries and the Japanese people under the banner of peace. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will support the Japanese people's just struggle with the greatest success.

    日本人民举行抗议拒发护照大会
    郭沫若刘宁一致电支持日本人民正义斗争
    【新华社二十六日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若致电日本人民抗议拒发护照大会，表示关怀和支持日本人民的正义斗争，并抗议日本吉田政府拒发护照并殴打和平代表的无理行为。电文如下：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议日本代表获取护照斗争委员会畑中政春先生并转日本人民抗议拒发护照大会：
    我代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民深切关怀和支持你们的正义斗争，并对日本政府拒发护照和指使暴徒殴打参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表的暴行，提出抗议。
    日本政府的暴行说明：以吉田茂为首的少数军国主义分子，在美国占领者的扶植下，正企图重理东条英机辈破了产的侵略事业；因此，它仇视和平，反对日本人民要求和平的善良愿望，甚至不惜采取卑鄙下流的流氓手段来阻挠和禁止日本和平代表参加和平会议。这种情形，使曾经长期遭受日本帝国主义侵略的中国人民与亚洲及太平洋区域其他各国人民，和日本人民同样地警惕到：坚决制止日本军国主义复活，已经成为保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平事业中的当前的迫切任务。
    我们知道，日本政府的任何暴行和迫害，都丝毫不能动摇日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的斗争。不顾反动派的阻挠，日本人民的和平代表仍继续为争取出国护照而奋斗，这种不屈不挠的精神，说明日本人民是坚决要和亚洲及太平洋区域其他各国的人民共同担当起保卫和平的神圣任务。中国人民完全同情和支持日本人民的斗争。我们相信，亚洲及太平洋区域其他国家人民也会一致表示同情和支持。我愿重述我在九月五日写的第二次给日本人民的公开信中所说的一句话：
    “无论你们的斗争将会遭到何种困难，亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民对于你们的支持是不会改变的，无宁会要以加倍的努力来声援你们的斗争。”
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若
    【新华社二十六日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会秘书长刘宁一，顷致电订于二十七日在东京举行的日本人民抗议拒发护照大会，支持日本人民的正义斗争。电文如下：东京亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议日本代表获取护照斗争委员会畑中政春先生并转日本人民抗议拒发护照大会：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将召开，亚洲及太平洋的各国人民都热烈期望日本全体和平代表能够出席这次意义重大的会议。但是，日本吉田政府在美国占领者的授意下，对日本和平代表却拒绝发给护照，并公然指使法西斯暴徒横加殴打。日本政府这种敌视和平、破坏和平运动的罪行，必将受到亚洲太平洋区域和世界所有爱好和平的人民的反对和严正指责。我特代表亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会向日本和平代表表示深切的慰问，向日本人民在东京举行的抗议大会表示热烈的支持，向为日本的独立、和平与民主而英勇斗争的日本人民表示崇高的敬意，并向日本政府表示最严重的抗议。
    反对日本重新军国主义化、保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，将是这次会议的中心议题。日本各阶层人民团结一致反对日本重新军国主义化、争取民族独立与和平、民主的英勇斗争，对于保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平以及世界和平，具有重大的意义，并因此将在这次会议中获得足够的重视。日本政府即使能够阻挠日本和平代表全体出席会议，却不能阻止日本人民争取独立和平与民主的斗争，更不能阻止亚洲及太平洋各国人民与日本人民在和平的旗帜下日益紧密的团结。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将以最大的成就来支援日本人民的正义斗争。
