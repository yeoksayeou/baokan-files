Beijing's on-the-job cadres have resumed regular theoretical study since July. This year, a total of more than 36,400 people (including some primary and secondary school teachers) are participating in theoretical study. Cadres in major factories and mines, who generally did not have regular theoretical studies in the past, are now studying under a unified city-wide plan.

From this study, it can be seen that leading cadres at all levels have generally attached importance to theoretical study since the "Three-Anti" Movement. The enthusiasm and initiative of general cadres in studying theory have also significantly improved. This is primarily reflected in the fact that cadres' theoretical study time is now guaranteed. In the past, agencies like the public security sub-bureaus, district joint cooperatives, and tax sub-bureaus claimed to be too busy with work to guarantee study time. Now, they generally adhere to six to nine hours of study time per week. Secondly, the leadership of study in various agencies has been strengthened. Each district joint cooperative has set up full-time cadres to lead the study. The public security sub-bureaus, district governments, and bank offices have also set up part-time cadres mainly to manage cadres' study. Most responsible comrades have made mobilization reports to cadres on their studies. Some have even served as theoretical instructors and tutors in their own agencies. Li Rui, secretary of the Sixth District Party Committee, also convened responsible cadres from all agencies in the district to conduct criticism and self-criticism, examining the shortcomings of past neglect of cadres' theoretical education. The vast majority of general cadres are able to adhere to the system, read diligently, and actively participate in discussions. Many people have also made reading plans, taken notes, and written心得 (xīn dé, insights gained from study). Everyone enthusiastically requested to listen to reports. The study lectures organized by the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department were attended by ten thousand people each time.

Last year, each district hired more than 30 part-time theoretical instructors for elementary classes. This year, each unit in the city has universally established part-time theoretical instructors for elementary classes, and 288 people have now been hired. In addition, tutoring work has been strengthened. Currently, there are 870 tutors for elementary classes and 387 tutors for intermediate classes. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department has held amateur lecture courses to train theoretical instructors and tutors for elementary classes, reporting to them on teaching methods and theoretical issues for each learning unit, and introducing teaching experience. The elementary theoretical instructor lecture course has been held three times, and the intermediate tutor lecture course has been held once. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department has also decided to pilot and promote the advanced methods of Soviet theoretical education - classroom discussion - this year. However, at present, due to the lower level of the tutors who preside over the discussions, they are not good at asking students questions, analyzing and summarizing their speeches. Therefore, the advantages of this method cannot be fully utilized. However, in the recent trials in various agencies, because the tutors and students generally prepared before the discussion, and the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department explained the specific methods of presiding over the discussion in the tutor lecture course, and prompted the basic content and possible difficult problems of each discussion topic, it still greatly helped everyone understand the basic spirit of the documents and reports, and the results were much better than the unprepared, unled group discussions of the past. This is mainly reflected in: First, this discussion is mainly based on designated speeches and the tutor asking questions and the students answering, which can supervise and check everyone's learning. Second, the tutor can finally make a clear conclusion, so that the learners can get a correct understanding of the issues discussed.

When starting to study "On Practice," everyone generally felt it was difficult to understand. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department immediately invited Comrade Ai Siqi to explain the basic content of "On Practice." The head of the Theoretical Education Section of the Propaganda Department also explained some philosophical terms and difficult issues that hindered learning in the tutor lecture course, and prompted ways to connect with reality. This greatly reduced the number of people who felt it was difficult to learn, drilled into terms, memorized provisions, and "linked with reality" indiscriminately. On the whole, the study of "On Practice" has been rewarding. The basic content of "On Practice" is generally understood. Everyone realized that "the study of problems must proceed from reality; there is no right to speak without investigation and research," "we must raise perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge; oppose mental laziness," and "revolutionaries must constantly and consciously transform their own thinking." Many cadres examined their past style of not conducting serious investigation and research, and the roots of bureaucracy in ideological methods. Secondly, the style of work of not using their brains, not summarizing work, and engaging in事务主义 (shì wù zhǔ yì, preoccupation with routine administrative matters) and empiricism was also criticized. Many cadres said: "Now I know that there is a method to thinking," "After learning 'On Practice', people become smarter."

At present, the learning situation in various units is uneven. Many factories lack experience in leadership because they have just established a regular learning system. The municipal government agencies have not led the study very well due to the adjustment of the management cadre learning institutions. There are also some departments where the leading cadres still do not pay enough attention to the study of cadres after the "Three-Anti" Movement, so the study is still very poor, which needs to be improved.

### 北京市在职干部恢复经常性的理论学习

    北京市在职干部恢复经常性的理论学习
    北京市的在职干部自七月起恢复了经常性的理论学习。今年参加理论学习的人员（包括一部分中小学教职员）共三万六千四百余人。各大厂矿的干部，过去一般没有经常性的理论学习，目前是在全市统一计划下进行学习。
    从这次学习当中可以看出，“三反”运动以后各级领导干部普遍地重视了理论学习，一般干部学习理论的积极性和自觉性也有显著提高，这首先表现在干部理论学习时间已有保证。过去推说业务忙、无法保证学习时间的机关如各公安分局、合作社各区联社、税务分局等，现在一般都能坚持每周六小时至九小时的学习时间。其次，各机关的学习领导加强了。合作社各区联社都设立了领导学习的专职干部。各公安分局、区政府和银行办事处也设立了以管理干部学习为主的兼职干部。大多数负责同志都对干部作过学习动员报告，有的还亲自担任了本机关的理论教员和辅导员。六区区委书记李锐并召集了全区各机关负责干部进行批评和自我批评，检查了过去不重视干部理论教育的缺点。一般干部绝大多数都能坚持制度，认真读书，积极参加讨论；许多人还作了读书计划，记笔记，写心得。大家热烈要求听报告，市委宣传部主办的学习讲座，每次参加听讲的达万人。
    去年各区曾聘请了兼职的初级班理论教员三十余人，今年全市各单位都普遍设立了兼职的初级班理论教员，现已聘请了二百八十八人，另外还加强了辅导工作，现初级班的辅导员已有八百七十余人，中级班的辅导员三百八十七人。市委宣传部为了训练初级班的理论教员和辅导员已分别举办了业余讲习班，就每一学习单元的教学方法和理论问题向他们作报告，并介绍教学经验。现初级理论教员讲习班已上过三次课，中级辅导员讲习班已上过一次课。市委宣传部并决定今年试行推广苏联理论教育的先进方法——课堂讨论。不过目前由于一般主持讨论的辅导员水平较低，还不善于向学员提出问题，分析和总结他们的发言，因此还不能充分发挥这个方法的优点，但是在最近各机关试行中，由于辅导员和学员在讨论前一般都作了准备，而且市委宣传部又在辅导员讲习班上说明了主持讨论的具体方法，提示了每一讨论题目的基本内容和可能发生的疑难问题，对大家领会文件和报告的基本精神仍有很大帮助，比过去那种无准备，无领导的小组讨论收效大得多。这主要表现在：第一，这种讨论以指定发言和辅导员问、学员答的方式为主，能够督促和检查大家的学习；第二，辅导员最后可以作出明确的结论，使学习的人对讨论的问题能得到正确的了解。
    开始学习“实践论”时，大家普遍觉得难，钻不进去。市委宣传部即请艾思奇同志讲解了“实践论”的基本内容，宣传部理论教育科科长在辅导员讲习班上又解释了一些阻碍学习的哲学名词和疑难问题，提示了联系实际的途径。这样就使那些感觉难学、钻名词、死啃条文和乱“联系实际”的人大大减少。总的看，“实践论”的学习是有收获的。一般都懂得了“实践论”的基本内容。大家体会到研究问题“必须从实际出发；没有调查研究就没有发言权。”“必须把感性认识提高到理性认识；反对思想懒汉。”“革命者必须不断自觉地改造自己的思想。”许多干部检讨了过去不认真调查研究的作风，及官僚主义在思想方法上的根源。其次，不动脑筋，不总结工作的事务主义和经验主义的作风也受到了批判。许多干部说：“现在才知道思想还要讲方法”，“学了‘实践论’，人变聪明了。”
    目前各单位的学习情况是不平衡的。许多工厂由于刚刚建立正规学习制度，领导方面还缺乏经验；市府机关由于调整管理干部学习的机构，也还没有把学习很好地领导起来。也有些部门由于领导干部在“三反”运动后对干部学习仍然不够重视，至今学习很差，这都是需要改进的。
