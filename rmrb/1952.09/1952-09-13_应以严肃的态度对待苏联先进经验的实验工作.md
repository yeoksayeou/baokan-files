    Experimental Work on Advanced Soviet Experiences Should Be Treated Seriously
    Editor: During our ideological self-criticism at the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, we discovered that the technical personnel of the Cotton Research Office, led by Peng Shoubang, treated the experiments and research on advanced Soviet experiences in an unserious and casual manner. This prevented the timely promotion of these advanced experiences in our country.
    In the North China region of our country, cotton is often not sown until late April due to frequent spring droughts. As a result, cotton does not bloom until after the frost, cotton bolls do not form well, and yields cannot be increased. In 1951, Soviet agricultural expert Lysenko, after learning about this situation, introduced us to an advanced Soviet experience—the cotton transplanting method—and suggested that we try it. This method involves selecting an early-maturing cotton variety, first raising seedlings in a greenhouse, and then transplanting them into the field after they have grown taller. This allows the cotton buds to sprout earlier, promotes root development, advances the cotton's maturity period, and thus potentially increases cotton production. After studying this suggestion from the Soviet expert, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government instructed the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute to experiment with it. After receiving the notification, Peng Shoubang, director of the Cotton Research Office, did not study it carefully and simply wrote "The institute has already done this, no need to do it again" on the document and did not conduct the experiment. In February of this year, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government repeatedly instructed the institute to "definitely do it." Although the institute carried out the "task," the attitude towards the experiment was not serious and conscientious, and the experiment was unsuccessful as a result. Originally, the most suitable location for cotton cultivation was in Shijiazhuang, but they did not conduct the "transplanting" experiment in Shijiazhuang. According to the Soviet expert's suggestion, "transplanting" should be done in a greenhouse, sown in paper bags, and on a large scale; however, Peng Shoubang and others used a cold frame, directly sowing the cotton seeds on the ground, planting them casually in two rows. They failed to promptly fertilize and irrigate the transplanted early-maturing cotton seedlings. As a result, although the transplanted cotton matured early, it did not grow well.
    So, is the advanced Soviet experience of transplanting cotton applicable in our country? The Shuangqiao Farm has already provided a factual answer to this question. The farm's experiment with the cotton transplanting method has now yielded preliminary results.
    Similar situations also occurred in the cotton "deep plowing" experiment conducted by the same office.
    Their disregard for advanced Soviet experiences is a result of their long-term influence by reactionary bourgeois biological theories. They are obsessed with the bourgeois genetic theory of "variety omnipotence" and are engrossed in "system breeding"; however, they harbor doubts about the advanced Soviet experiences in cultivation and engage in them perfunctorily—they do not study them with a warm welcome and a humble scientific attitude, but rather negate them based on their own narrow views. For example, when they received the task of doing the cotton transplanting experiment, their first thoughts were "Greenhouse seedling cultivation is not practical," "Where would the countryside get so many greenhouses?" and "Transplanting is too labor-intensive." However, they fundamentally did not understand that although there are no English or American-style "greenhouses" in the countryside, there are many practical earthen greenhouses, and cotton transplantation precisely meets the characteristics of the current small-scale peasant production in China. Although transplanting is labor-intensive, it can be compensated for by increased yields. This also demonstrates that they only know about the so-called "greenhouses" promoted in English and American bourgeois books, and do not understand the actual conditions of the Chinese countryside. I believe that scientific workers like Peng Shoubang should learn a lesson from the above facts, transform their thinking properly, and enable their science and technology to serve the people more effectively.

### 应以严肃的态度对待苏联先进经验的实验工作

    应以严肃的态度对待苏联先进经验的实验工作
    编辑同志：我们华北农业科学研究所在这次业务思想检查中，发现棉作研究室以彭寿邦为首的技术人员，以不认真不严肃的态度来对待苏联先进经验的实验和研究，这就使先进经验不能及时地在我国推广。
    我国华北地区由于春天多旱，棉花往往迟至四月底才播种。这样，棉花就要到霜后才开花，棉桃结不好，产量提不高。一九五一年苏联农学专家卢森科知道这一情况后，便把苏联的先进经验——棉花移栽法介绍给我们，建议我们试行。这种方法是：选择一种早熟的棉种，早期在温室先行育苗，长高后再移种到地里去。这样，棉芽就发得早，促进根的发育，提早棉花的成熟期，也就可能提高棉花的产量。中央人民政府农业部研究了苏联专家这一建议后，指示由华北农业科学研究所实验。该所棉作研究室主任彭寿邦接到通知后，不加研究，就在上面写了“本所已做过，不用再做”这样几个字，不作实验。今年二月间，中央人民政府农业部一再指示该所“一定要做”。该所虽然执行了“任务”，但实验的态度不是严肃认真的，结果实验没有成功。本来，棉花栽培地点最适宜是在石家庄，但他们并没有把“移栽”的实验拿到石家庄去做。根据苏联专家的建议，“移栽”要在温室，用纸袋播种，大面积地播；而彭寿邦等则用冷床，把棉籽直接播在地上，随随便便地播它两行。对移栽早熟的棉苗，不及时施肥和灌溉。以致移栽的棉花虽然早熟，但长得并不好。
    那么苏联移栽棉花的先进经验，究竟在我国是不是适用呢？双桥农场对这个问题已经有了事实的回答。该场实验的棉花移栽法，现在已初步获得了成绩。
    类此情况同样还发生在该室所作的棉花“深耕”实验中。
    他们之所以漠视苏联的先进经验，是因为他们长期地受了反动的资产阶级生物学说影响的结果。他们迷信资产阶级的“品种万能”的遗传学说，醉心于“系统育种”；而对栽培方面的苏联先进经验，则是横加怀疑，草率从事——他们不是以热烈欢迎、虚心实验的科学态度来研究它，而是凭着一己的狭隘之见就否定它。例如，当他们接到要做棉花移栽的试验时，首先想到的是“温室育苗不切合实际”、“农村哪里来那样多的温室”和“移苗太费工”等。可是，他们根本不了解农村中虽然没有英、美式的“温室”，但却有许多有实际效果的土温室，而且棉花移植，恰巧符合当前中国小农生产的特点。移苗虽费工，但却可以从丰产中获得补偿。这也正说明了他们只知道英美资产阶级书本上所宣传的所谓“温室”，而不了解中国农村的实际情况。我觉得像彭寿邦这样的科学工作者，应该从上述事实中取得教训，好好地改造自己的思想，使自己的科学技术能更有效地为人民服务。
