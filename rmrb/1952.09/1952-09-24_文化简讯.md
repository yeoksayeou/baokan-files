	Successful Slide Projector Work in Northern Jiangsu

	Over the past year, slide projector work in Northern Jiangsu has steadily developed under the leadership of the Party and cultural and educational departments. It has achieved excellent results in publicizing policies, laws, current events, hygiene, and popularizing scientific knowledge.

	The number of slide projectors in Northern Jiangsu has now increased to over 200. Taking the slide show screenings in 31 cultural centers in counties like Xinghua as an example, in 1951 alone, there were 1,155 screenings, with over 810,000 viewers. Most of the slides used in various places are self-drawn and compiled based on local real people and events. Under the principles of "Popularization First" and "Facing the Entire Region," cultural centers and cultural stations in various parts of Northern Jiangsu go deep into the vast rural areas to show slides, achieving great results in enlightening, educating the masses, and improving their political and cultural level. For example, during the summer grain collection last year, the Taixing Cultural Center screened "Pay Patriotic Grain Early, Defeat American Imperialism, and Strive to be a Grain-Paying Model" in Sanlizhuang. The next day, the masses automatically delivered public grain to the warehouse.

	The slide projector work in Northern Jiangsu is closely integrated with the central work and the lives of the masses in each period. During the Huai River control period, they followed the migrant workers to the dam to show slides and collected materials from the migrant workers to quickly produce slides for screening, which inspired the workers' enthusiasm for labor.

	The slide projector work in Northern Jiangsu also played a significant role in publicizing current events and policies. For example, during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Tushan Town in Pi-Sui County, Northern Jiangsu, screened "Illustrated Explanation of the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." The masses reflected:
	"The slides have pictures and explanations, which are clearer than reading public notices." After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, films such as "Tai Xiuying's Independent Marriage" were screened. Many elderly people said, "I don't know how many people the Marriage Law has saved!"

	In terms of popularizing scientific knowledge, various places in Northern Jiangsu have screened films such as "Summer Hygiene," "Pregnancy Hygiene," and "Prevention and Control of Rice Borers." Combined with oral propaganda, the masses received great education, and the audience believed that "it is better than attending meetings, it is good-looking, and it is easy to understand." The experience of slide projector screenings in Northern Jiangsu proves that its propaganda effect will be greater if it can flexibly use various explanation methods.

	Most of the Graduates from Higher Education Institutions Participating in Northeast Economic Construction Have Arrived in Shenyang

	Most of the more than 7,000 graduates from this year's higher education institutions (including more than 2,000 from the Northeast region) who are participating in Northeast economic construction have arrived in Shenyang.

	The Northeast People's Government held a welcome meeting on the 15th to express condolences and welcome. At the meeting, Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Zou Lufeng, Deputy Minister of Education, Feng Bingtian, Deputy Minister of Personnel, and Wang Wenqi, Minister of the Student Department of the Northeast Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, delivered welcome speeches successively. Gao Chongmin pointed out in his speech: "The Northeast has begun to carry out large-scale economic construction with emphasis, and urgently needs a large number of specialized technical talents. I hope that everyone will recognize the glory of this task, obey the organization's allocation, and work actively."

	Representatives of higher education graduates Dong Yizheng and Li Lanqing said in their replies: We must study hard, work actively, overcome all difficulties, and serve the people wholeheartedly. After the meeting, the Northeast People's Art Theater performed the famous Soviet drama "Dawn Shines on Moscow" to express their welcome.

    苏北区的幻灯工作有成绩
    苏北区的幻灯工作一年来在党和文教部门的领导下不断地发展着。它在宣传政策、法令、时事、卫生和普及科学知识等方面，都有很好的成绩。
    现在苏北区幻灯机已增至二百多架。以兴化等县三十一个文化馆中的幻灯放映为例，一九五一年内共放映了一千一百五十五次，观众达八十一万人以上。各地使用的幻灯片，大部分是根据当地的真人真事，自行编绘。在“普及第一”“面向全区”的原则下，苏北各地文化馆、文化站深入广大农村去放映，在启发、教育群众和提高群众政治文化水平方面，收到了很大效果。例如：去年夏征期间，泰兴文化馆在三里庄放映了“早缴爱国粮，打垮美帝国主义，争取作缴粮模范”以后，第二天群众就自动把公粮送到仓库去。
    苏北的幻灯工作是和每一时期的中心工作和群众生活密切结合着的。在治淮期间，他们随着民工到堤上去放映幻灯，并从民工中搜集材料，赶制灯片放映，这样就鼓舞了民工们的劳动热情。
    在宣传时事政策方面，苏北区的幻灯工作也起了很大作用。如在镇压反革命运动中，苏北邳睢县土山镇放映了“惩治反革命条例图解”，群众反映：
    “幻灯有画有解释，比看布告更明白了。”婚姻法颁布后，放映了“邰秀英婚姻自主”等片，许多老年人说：“婚姻法不知救活了多少人！”
    在普及科学知识方面，苏北各地曾放映了“夏令卫生”、“孕期卫生”、“防治螟虫”等片，配合口头宣传，使群众受到很大教育，观众都认为“比开会强，又好看，又容易懂。”苏北区幻灯放映的经验证明：如果能够灵活运用各种讲解方式，它的宣传效果也就更大。
    参加东北经济建设的高等学校毕业生大部分已到达沈阳
    参加东北经济建设工作的七千多名本届高等学校毕业生（包括东北地区二千多人），大部分已到达沈阳。
    东北人民政府为表示慰问和欢迎，在十五日举行了欢迎大会。会上，东北人民政府副主席高崇民、教育部副部长邹鲁风、人事部副部长冯秉天、中国新民主主义青年团东北委员会学生部部长王文琪等先后致欢迎词。高崇民在致词中指出：“东北已开始有重点地进行大规模的经济建设，迫切需要大量的专门技术人才，希望大家认识这一任务的光荣，服从组织分配，积极工作”。
    高等学校毕业生代表董贻正、李岚清在答词中表示：一定要努力学习，积极工作，克服一切困难，做到全心全意地为人民服务。会后，东北人民艺术剧院演出苏联名剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”表示欢迎。
