    Expose War Conspiracies and Strengthen the Unity of Peace-Loving People
    Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    When the Second World War was not completely over, a group of American warmongers, especially those arms dealers who made a fortune in the war, were already brewing a "Third World War."
    What skills did they have to dare to carry out such a sinful activity in front of the vast majority of good people in the world? Simply put, it's nothing more than deception and intimidation. In order to achieve the purpose of deception, they must first fabricate an enemy and use all kinds of malicious propaganda to slander them. The great achievements created by the people themselves in peaceful construction and increased production in the peaceful camp led by the Soviet Union were forcibly described as the same as their actions—exploiting the people and expanding armaments for war.
    They portray themselves as "humanitarians" standing in a "defensive" position. At the same time, they exaggerate how superior the countries and nations under their rule are, allowing a group of simple-minded people to become arrogant and conceited. The Nazi Germany's nonsense about the most superior "Aryan" race and the American imperialists' self-congratulatory "American way of life" belong to this category.
    The US government also uses the so-called "US aid" to support the reactionary ruling classes of many countries, hoping to exploit and deceive the people of those countries through them. On the surface, they say they want to alleviate their economic difficulties, but in reality, they are making them increasingly lose their political independence and are increasingly threatened by economic collapse.
    What they fear most is that the people will wake up and unite to oppose their conspiracies and tricks. Therefore, they use every means to conceal their own crimes, and at the same time, they use every means to sow discord among the people of various countries, hindering mutual understanding and unity among the people of various countries.
    In order to achieve the purpose of intimidation, they try their best to publicize what terrible weapons they have mastered to scare the people. At the same time, they use the rumors of their fabricated "enemies may soon use some terrible weapons" to threaten their own people, to clamor for "pre-emptive" war, and to create war hysteria.
    Ever since two atomic bombs fell on the peaceful cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, which had already been defeated and ruled by militarism, until now, what the warmongers have been clamoring for is: how big an atomic pile they have mastered, and how terrible various types of atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction have been manufactured, including the most cruel bacteriological weapons that they have openly used. Their original plan was obviously this: if they use the atomic weapons they have mastered and make everyone afraid through a lot of propaganda, and dare not express resistance to them, then it will be a success in their intimidation policy. If this simple means of intimidation cannot achieve their desired goals, then they have to launch a so-called "limited war," display the various weapons they boast about, and try to slaughter the old, weak, women, children, and all peace-loving people. That is what the American generals did in Korea on the orders of their masters in Washington.
    If they really want to launch a large-scale war, their wishful thinking is obviously this: one hand manipulating the general switch of financial institutions and arms factories, and the other hand holding the hub of the war machine, pressing a button at will, hundreds of thousands of peaceful people like Hiroshima and Nagasaki (for obvious reasons, preferably the so-called colored people or Asian people) will die immediately. At most, let their playboy professional executioners sit in safe planes and directly or indirectly drive the minions on the ground to carry out their orders for mass slaughter and blind destruction. The Washington warmongers' clamor to expand the air force and navy is clear evidence of this plan.
    Unfortunately, the American generals discovered that the skies over Korea and Northeast China were not that safe; on the ground in Korea, they encountered the iron-like resistance of the Korean and Chinese people. No matter what weapons, in the face of angry and righteous people, have been definitively proven to be unable to save the American generals from failure. Even the most cruel bacteriological weapons, despite being used on a large scale, did not have the desired effect on the battlefield. Despite their best efforts to conceal and deny this crime, it was finally completely exposed by fair-minded people and righteous scientists around the world who fought for the truth. The people of the satellite countries who were forced to act as cannon fodder watched as the arrogant American soldiers secretly "rotated" away; inevitably, the question arose among them: why were they, these unfortunate people, the only ones who had to stay in this hellish place year after year to die? This explains why the morale of the invading army in Korea has fallen to such an irredeemable level.
    The US government is preparing for the launch of a third world war according to the wishful thinking mentioned above. They are trying their best to use inducements and threats to force the people of some satellite countries, especially the people of West Germany and Japan, to arm themselves and act as cannon fodder, so that once a major war occurs, the deaths of their own troops can be reduced, and the deception of their own people can be avoided due to the large number of deaths of their own troops. But the facts have proved that despite their best efforts to piece together, they still cannot piece together the "European Army" needed by the warmongers to die for them; despite all the shouting, they still cannot shout out the disgusting Pacific "security" system centered on the remaining Japanese war criminals. What is especially important is that the people of Japan and West Germany are no longer the people under fascist rule in the past, and they have increasingly powerfully expressed their rejection of war and support for peace.
    After understanding these situations, our work to defend peace should obviously be done from two aspects:
    1. We must stop all acts of aggression that have already been launched and teach the aggressors a profound lesson. The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have already done this on the Korean battlefield, and the heroic Vietnamese people, Malayan people, and other peace-loving people in Asia who resist aggression have also made up their minds to repel all forms of aggression and defend peace with action.
    2. We must try our best to expose all the deception and intimidation tactics of the warmongers so that the peace-loving people all over the world can recognize who wants peace and who wants war. As is well known, since the Soviet people defeated the German and Japanese fascist bandits, their great efforts have been focused on peaceful construction. This can be proved not only from its efforts to quickly recover from the wounds of war, but even the American "New York Times" has to admit that the Soviet Union, in the recently announced draft of the Five-Year Plan instructions, stipulated a significant increase in the production of grain and consumer goods in order to further improve the peaceful and happy life of the Soviet people.
    The proportion of our national budget also proves that the Chinese people love peace. This year, more than 70 percent of our budget is used for various peaceful construction projects. Judging from the development trend of various peaceful construction projects that have already laid the foundation, our proportion in this area will inevitably exceed this figure next year. This is in stark contrast to the fact that more than 80 percent of the US budget is used for military purposes. This one decisive factor alone is enough to determine who wants war and who wants peace.
    Every other People's Democratic country is striving to develop construction. The large-scale exhibition recently held in China by Hungary clearly proves this fact.
    Marshal Stalin said: "The most talented, most loyal and most energetic minority will be helpless if they do not rely on the support, even if it is passive, of millions of people." This is the truth. This is the case in the peace camp; we believe that it cannot be otherwise in countries manipulated by warmongers. Therefore, the urgent task of all of us peace-loving people at present is to strive for unity, to strive for broader unity, and to strive for more solid unity; to resolutely oppose war.
    It must be pointed out that the warmongers cannot be reasoned with. Their large profits—the war industry—are not something they are easily willing to give up. The magic weapon they believe in—weapons—is not something they are easily willing to throw away. However, if they want to struggle on these two paths, they must grasp an important condition. This is that they cannot but rely on the cooperation of technical scientists. Therefore, finally, we have to ask the technical scientists all over the world in a very serious manner to unite, take out their wisdom, take out their courage, and take out their conscience, not to succumb to the inducements and threats of the warmongers, and bravely refuse to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. This is one of the most effective ways to stop war, save science, and save the world. We also issue a warning: The victory of the Chinese people has created sufficient conditions to guarantee the victory of the peace-loving people in Asia and the world. Those who help the warmongers harm the people will one day be subject to just sanctions in front of the broad masses of people around the world.
    As the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference is about to be held, let our peace-loving people, especially scientists who uphold justice and maintain peace, unite more widely and more strongly to fight against all war conspiracies. Unity is strength, and victory will surely belong to the defenders of peace.

    揭穿战争阴谋，加强和平人民的团结
    中国科学院副院长  李四光
    当第二次世界大战还没有完全结束的时候，美国的一伙战争贩子，特别是在战争中发了横财的军火商人，就已经在酝酿“第三次世界大战”了。
    他们有什么本领在世界广大善良的人民面前敢于进行那种罪恶的勾当？简单地说，不外欺骗和恫吓两种手段。为了达到欺骗的目的，他们首先就得捏造一个敌人，用一切恶毒的宣传，横加诬蔑。把以苏联为首的和平阵营中在和平建设、增加生产方面人民自己创造出来的伟大成绩，硬说成是和他们所作所为的——压榨人民，扩军备战的勾当一样。
    他们把自己说成是“人道主义者”，是站在“防御”地位。同时又夸张在他们统治之下的国家和民族是如何优越；让一班头脑简单的人骄妄自大。法西斯德国所吹嘘的“亚利安”人种最优秀的胡说和美国帝国主义者所妄自恭维的“美国生活方式”，就是属于这一类。
    美国政府还利用所谓“美援”的形式，支持许多国家的反动统治阶级；希望通过他们来压榨并欺骗那些国家的人民。表面上说什么要解除他们的经济困难，实际上使他们政治上越来越失掉独立，经济上越来越受到崩溃的威胁。
    他们最害怕的是人民觉悟起来、团结起来，反对他们的阴谋诡计。于是用尽一切方法来隐瞒他们自己的罪行，同时也用尽一切手段在各国人民中进行挑拨离间，妨碍各国人民间的相互了解和团结。
    他们为了达到恫吓的目的，就尽量地宣传他们已经掌握着什么什么可怕的武器来吓唬人民。同时又拿他们所虚构的“敌人很快就可能使用什么什么可怕的武器”的谣言，来威胁自己的人民，来叫嚣“先发制人”的战争，来制造战争歇斯底里。
    自从两颗原子弹落到已经战败了的、受着军国主义统治的日本的和平城市广岛和长崎以后，直到现在，战争贩子们所叫嚣的就是：他们已经掌握着多么大的原子堆，他们已经制成了多么可怕的各种大小类型的原子武器、化学武器和其它各种大规模屠杀人类的武器，包括他们自己已经公开地使用最残忍的细菌武器。他们原来的计划显然是这样的：如果用他们所掌握的原子武器，通过大量宣传，使人人害怕，不敢对他们表示反抗，那便是恫吓政策上的成功。如果这种简单的恫吓手段不能达到他们为所欲为的目的，那就得发动所谓“有限度的战争”，摆出他们所夸耀的各式各样武器，尽量屠杀老弱妇孺和一切和平的人民。美国将军们奉了华盛顿的主子的命令在朝鲜所干的就是这个。
    如果他们真要发动大规模的战争的话，他们的如意算盘显然是这样打的：一手操纵着金融机构和军火工厂的总开关，另一只手抓着战争机器的枢纽，随意把揿纽一按，像广岛、长崎那样几十万的和平人民（理由很明显，最好是所谓有色人民或亚洲人民）立刻死亡。最多不过让他们的纨袴的职业刽子手们坐在安全的飞机里直接地或者间接地驱遣在地上帮凶的喽啰们执行他们大量屠杀和盲目破坏的命令。华盛顿的战争贩子们叫嚣扩大空军和海军，就是这样打算的明证。
    不如意的事是：美国将军们发现了在朝鲜和中国东北的空中，并不是那么安全；在朝鲜的地上更碰到了朝中人民铁一般的抵抗。无论什么武器，在愤怒的、正义填胸的人民面前，都已经被确切地证明了不能挽救这些美国将军们的失败。连最残忍的细菌武器，尽管大规模地使用，在战场上并没有发生他们所希望得到的效果。尽管他们用尽一切方法掩饰和抵赖这种罪行，终于被全世界公正人士和正义的、为真理而奋斗的科学家们，完全揭穿了。仆从国家的被迫充当炮灰的人们，眼看着盛气凌人的美国大兵们偷偷地“轮换”走了；他们中间不可避免地发生了这样一个问题：为什么独独要他们这些倒霉的人，成年累月地呆在这个鬼地方送死？这就说明了侵朝军的士气为什么低落到这样无可挽救的程度。
    美国政府正按照上面所说的如意算盘，来作发动第三次世界大战的准备。他们尽量用利诱和威胁的手段，强迫一些仆从国家的人民，特别是西德和日本的人民，武装起来，充当炮灰，以便一旦大战发生，可以减少本国军队的死亡，可以避免由于本国军队大量死亡而戳破了他们对国内人民的欺骗手段。但是事实已经证明：尽管尽量拼凑，仍然拼凑不起战争贩子们所需要的为他们送死的“欧洲军”；尽管嚷来嚷去，仍然嚷不出令人厌恶的、以残余的日本战犯为中心的太平洋“安全”体系。尤其重要的是：日本和西德人民已经不是旧日在法西斯统治下的人民，他们已经越来越有力地表示唾弃战争，拥护和平。
    了解了这些情况后，我们保卫和平的工作显然应该从两方面去做：
    一、我们必须制止一切已经发动的侵略行为，使侵略者得到深切的教训。英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上已经这样作了，英勇的越南人民、马来亚人民和亚洲其他各处爱好和平、反抗侵略的人民，也都已下定了决心来打退各种形式的侵略，用行动来保卫和平。
    二、我们必须尽量揭穿战争贩子的一切欺骗和恫吓的手段，让全世界爱好和平的人民认清楚谁要和平、谁要战争。如所周知：苏联人民自从打垮了德、日法西斯匪帮以后，他们伟大的努力是贯注在和平建设事业方面的。这不独从它迅速恢复战争创伤的努力中可以得到证明，而且连美国“纽约时报”都不得不承认苏联在最近公布的五年计划指示草案中，为了更提高苏联人民的和平幸福生活，规定了大大增加粮食和消费品的产量。
    我们国家预算的比例也证明了中国人民是热爱和平的。本年度我们预算的百分之七十以上用在各种和平建设事业。从已经打下了基础的各项和平建设事业的发展趋势看来，明年度我们这方面的比例，必然还要超过这个数字。这和美国百分之八十以上的预算用在军事方面适成鲜明的对比。单就这一个有决定性的因素而言，就足够判明谁要战争，谁要和平。
    其他人民民主国家没有一个不是争先恐后地发展建设事业。最近匈牙利在中国举办的大规模的展览会，便很清楚地证明了这一事实。
    斯大林大元帅说过：“最有才能、最忠实和最有精力的少数人，如果不依靠千百万人的那怕是消极的支持，他们就会束手无策。”这是真理。在和平阵营中是这样；在受着战争贩子们操纵的国家里，我们相信也不能不是这样。因此，我们一切爱好和平的人民当前迫切的任务，就是要争取团结、争取更广泛的团结、争取更巩固的团结；坚决地反对战争。
    必须指出：战争贩子们是不可以理喻的。他们的大量利润所在——战争工业——不是他们轻易情愿放弃的。他们所迷信的法宝——武器，也不是他们轻易愿意抛掉的。但是，他们要想在这两条路上挣扎，就必须抓紧一个重要的条件。这就是不能不依靠技术科学家们的合作。因此，最后我们不得不以极严肃的态度，要求全世界的技术科学家们，团结起来，拿出智慧，拿出勇气，拿出良心来，不要在战争贩子们的利诱和威胁下屈服，勇敢地拒绝制造大量屠杀的武器。这就是制止战争、挽救科学、挽救世界的最有效的办法之一。我们也提出警告：中国人民的胜利，已经创造了足够的条件，保障亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民的胜利。帮助战争贩子危害人民的人们，终有一天是要在全世界广大人民的面前受到正义的制裁的。
    当亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将举行之际，让我们爱好和平的人民，特别是维护正义、维护和平的科学家们，更广泛地、更坚强地团结起来，向一切战争阴谋作斗争。团结就是力量，胜利必然属于和平保卫者。
