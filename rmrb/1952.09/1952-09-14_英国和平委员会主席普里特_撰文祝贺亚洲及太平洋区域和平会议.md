Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 13th: Pritt, member of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the British Peace Committee, wrote on September 3rd to congratulate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The full text is as follows:

    I send my congratulations to all who are participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and wish them the greatest success in their work. May this conference achieve fruitful results in rebuilding and consolidating world peace.

    Peace is important to all of us, but especially to the people of Asia. The people of Asia make up half of the world's population, and most of them have either recently shaken off the oppression of colonialism or are still colonial peoples, resolutely and actively striving for their liberation. For them, peace is as indispensable as the air they breathe. They will strive to complete this great and noble task of building a more perfect, richer, and more cultured life for themselves and their children.

    Moreover, the people of Asia are currently suffering from the pain of barbaric and cruel wars, wars being waged in three regions, all created in Asia by foreign imperialist forces.

    The people of Asia know that it is not enough to merely hope for peace. They cannot achieve peace by ignoring the Western world, nor can they turn a deaf ear to the activities of those mad, small, but powerful forces that bring war to them on the grounds of ideas held by people in distant lands, vainly hoping to destroy other people's ways of life or force others to accept their way of life. The people of Asia know that in the struggle for peace, "neutrality" is impossible; simply saying "I do not want to participate in this slaughter" is useless. For their own sake and for the sake of the rest of the world, they must actively participate in the work of building peace. Peace is their own business, at least as much as it is the business of the peoples of other continents. If the people of all countries work together actively, they can achieve peace.

    Thus far, the broad world peace movement, with the wise and prudent help of the leaders of the People's Republic of China, has prevented the outbreak of a third world war at a critical moment and has limited the current intense wars to limited regions – although these limited regions are still tragically vast and suffering from tragic destruction. However, if further progress is to be made to make peace perfect and consolidated, the world peace movement must become stronger and broader. Half of the people of the world have undoubtedly joined the peace movement, but half is not enough. We must work more actively. Our enemies, the warmongers, possess a large number of newspapers and radio stations, and a large number of napalm bombs. They are powerful and their strength must not be underestimated. However, we, on the other hand, possess the source of all power, which is the people of the world. Without them, or against their will, bombs cannot be dropped for long, and the lies published in newspapers will eventually lose their effect, as long as – I particularly emphasize – the people of the world can unite as one to pressure all governments to seek the path of peace.

    Therefore, with victorious confidence, I urge the people of Asian and Pacific countries who have sent representatives to this conference to formulate concrete measures to ensure that their own governments:

    (1) Stop all wars currently in progress;

    (2) Immediately and unconditionally prohibit the manufacture or use of weapons of mass destruction;

    (3) Negotiate and sign a disarmament treaty among the five major powers;

    (4) Take measures to promote and safeguard the national independence of all peoples, to ensure that they can freely choose their way of life, develop freely in that way of life, and enjoy consolidated peace.

    All of us, yes, all of us, must concentrate all our strength to fight for the reconstruction of peace. In this struggle, the people of all continents are equal and equally important. United together, we can defeat the warmongers.

    英国和平委员会主席普里特
    撰文祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】世界和平理事会理事、英国和平委员会主席普里特，在九月三日撰文祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，全文如下：
    我向全体参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的人们祝贺，并祝他们的工作取得最大的成功。愿这次会议对于重建和巩固世界和平，取得丰硕的成果。
    和平对我们大家都是很重要的，而对亚洲人民尤其重要。亚洲人民占全世界人口的半数，他们之中的大多数，不是最近才挣脱了殖民主义的压迫，就是仍然是殖民地的人民，正在坚决地、积极地争取自己的解放。对于他们来说，和平就好像他们时刻呼吸的空气一样必不可少，他们会为了他们自己和他们的孩子建设更完美、更丰富和更有文化的生活，努力完成这一伟大和崇高的任务。
    而且，亚洲人民目前正遭受着野蛮和残酷的战争的痛苦，战争在三个地区进行着，这些都是外国帝国主义力量在亚洲制造的战争。
    亚洲人民知道：光是希望和平是不够的，他们不能够不理会西方世界而取得和平，他们也不能充耳不闻那些疯狂的、人数很少但却有力的势力的活动，这些势力以遥远地方的人民所抱有的思想为理由，把战争带给他们，而枉然希望摧毁别人的生活方式，或强使别人接受他们的生活方式。亚洲人民知道：在争取和平的斗争里，“中立”是不可能的；光是口里说“我不愿参与这种屠杀”是不管用的；无论是为了他自己还是为了世界其他地方，他们都必须积极地参加建立和平的工作。和平是他们自己的事，至少也像是其他各洲的人民的事一样。如果各国人民都一致积极努力，他们就能得到和平。
    至今为止，广泛的世界和平运动，在中华人民共和国领袖的英明审慎的帮助之下，已在千钧一发的时刻防止了第三次世界大战的爆发，并使目前激烈的战争限制在有限的地区内——虽然这有限的地区仍是可悲地广阔而且受着悲惨的破坏。但是，如果要取得更进一步的进展，使和平完美和巩固，世界和平运动还必须更加强大、更加广泛。全世界人民的半数已经确定无疑地参加到和平运动里来了，但是半数还是不够的。我们必须更积极地努力。我们的敌人战争贩子拥有大量的报纸和电台，拥有大量的凝固汽油弹，他们是厉害的，决不可低估他们的力量。但是，我们这方面却拥有一切力量的源泉，这就是全世界人民，没有他们，或者违反他们的意志，炸弹就不能长久地往下丢，报纸刊载的谎话也终将有一天会失去作用，只要——我特别强调地说，只要——全世界人民能联合一致，压迫一切政府去谋求和平的道路。
    因此，我怀着胜利的信心，吁请派有代表出席这次会议的亚洲和太平洋各国人民制订出具体的措施，以保证他们本国政府：
    （一）停止目前进行中的一切战争；
    （二）立即无条件禁止制造或使用具有大规模毁灭性的武器；
    （三）谈判并签订五大国裁军公约；
    （四）采取措施以促进并保障各国人民的民族独立，保障他们能自由选择他们的生活方式，在那种生活方式中自由发展，并保障他们享有巩固的和平。
    我们全体，是的，我们全体，必须集中全部力量为重建和平而斗争。在这个斗争中，各洲人民都是平等的，都是同样重要的。只要团结在一起，我们就能够战胜战争贩子。
