Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 26th: The U.S. side continues to adopt bloody methods to abuse and kill captured Korean and Chinese personnel who wish to return home.

During August, incidents of killing and wounding captured Korean and Chinese personnel detained by the U.S. side occurred almost daily. This month, such incidents have been announced every week. In the latest incident on Jeju Island on September 23rd, as many as 49 captured personnel were injured. The statement issued by the U.S. military secretly concealed the nationalities of these captured personnel, but it is known that the prisoners on Jeju Island are mostly Chinese People's Volunteers captured personnel who Harrison referred to as "unwilling to be repatriated." Based solely on reports from U.S. and British news agencies, there have been incidents of massacring captured Korean and Chinese personnel every month since February. The number of people killed and injured during this period is over one thousand. Reports from captured paratrooper spies and letters from our captured personnel stated that several thousand were killed and injured. The methods used by the U.S. side to kill and injure prisoners of war are: shooting, using flamethrowers, tear gas, grenades, and tanks, and sometimes even beheading.

These bloodstained figures and facts have shown that, despite the U.S. side's use of brutal means against captured Korean and Chinese personnel for more than a year, they have consistently failed to shake the will of these captured personnel to return home. The U.S. side's inhumane fabrication of the so-called deception that captured Korean and Chinese personnel are unwilling to return home, and its forced detention of captured Korean and Chinese personnel, is precisely the root cause of these monthly massacres of prisoners of war.

The iron curtain of U.S. news censorship prevents the world from knowing the terrifying conditions in the prisoner of war camps on Geoje Island and nearby islands, as well as in the prisoner of war camps on the Korean mainland. The U.S. side completely imposed a news blackout on the massacre of prisoners of war that occurred last year. The Associated Press only reported in May this year that at least 115 prisoners of war on Geoje Island had been beaten, strangled, and tortured to death since July last year. Captured paratrooper spies said that in January this year, 170 Korean prisoners of war were massacred because they sang "The Song of Kim Il-sung" and demanded repatriation. From this, it appears that there have been incidents of killing and wounding prisoners of war every month during these nine months of this year.

On June 10th this year, the executioner Boatner conducted a large-scale massacre while dispersing prisoners into small camps to facilitate forced "screening" of prisoners of war. In the few months or so after this, the U.S. side again implemented a complete news blackout. It was only due to the exposure by the Korean and Chinese sides that a gap was opened in this blockade, forcing the U.S. side to reveal on August 26th that since the beginning of August, incidents of killing and wounding prisoners of war had occurred almost daily.

In the last week of last month alone, the following incidents occurred: On August 23rd, 13 people were killed and injured on Geoje Island; on the 24th, one person was killed on Geoje Island and one person was killed in Yeongcheon on the Korean mainland; in Masan, one prisoner of war was killed by a falling rock and one was injured; on the 25th, one person was injured in Sanmotai (transliteration) on the Korean mainland; on the 26th, nine people were injured on Geoje Island; on the 27th, 15 people were injured on Geoje Island; on the 28th, 12 people were injured on Geoje Island and three people were injured on Jeju Island; on the 30th, 16 people were injured on Geoje Island, and one person "committed suicide by hanging."

Analyzing the news of the massacre of prisoners of war over the past two months reveals that the number of incidents is constantly increasing. The new wave of massacres is expanding from the "Island of Death" - Geoje Island - to Jeju Island and Pongan Island, as well as the Korean mainland, where, according to American generals, the prisoners of war are those who "refuse repatriation." The U.S. side only releases brief messages to journalists about these massacre incidents. They deliberately do not publish information about the nationalities of these prisoners of war or how and why they were killed and injured. The U.S. side is also tight-lipped about the nature of the prisoners of war's "demonstrations" and their will to return home.

The U.S. military's announcement stated that the massacres were carried out by "United Nations forces," indicating that British and Canadian troops also participated in these massacres.

News of prisoners of war "committing suicide" has increased, although Harrison said, "If prisoners of war are repatriated, they will commit suicide." It has now been discovered that four prisoners of war "hanged themselves," and recently another prisoner of war was taken down before he died while hanging himself. The U.S. side has not announced why these prisoners of war "committed suicide." But it is very clear that they were killed under the U.S. side's argument of "no forced repatriation." For prisoners of war, "no forced repatriation" means death or forever being slaves to their enemies.

These "demonstrations" and massacre of prisoner of war incidents are the inevitable result of Washington's policy of detaining prisoners of war and undermining the truce negotiations. Every killing and wounding of prisoners of war reminds the people of the world that the U.S. side's crimes in massacring prisoners of war exceed the crimes of the German and Japanese fascist bandits during World War II.

### 美方虐杀我被俘人员的罪行不断增加  证明美方所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的骗局彻底破产

    美方虐杀我被俘人员的罪行不断增加
    证明美方所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的骗局彻底破产
    【新华社开城二十六日电】美方继续采取血腥手段，虐杀希望回家的朝中被俘人员。
    八月间几乎每天都发生打死打伤被美方拘留的朝中被俘人员的事件。在本月当中，每星期都宣布这样的事件。九月二十三日在济州岛发生的最近一次事件中，被打伤的被俘人员竟达四十九人之多。美军发表的声明，秘不透露这些被俘人员的国籍，但是大家知道，济州岛上的战俘多半是哈利逊所说的“不愿被遣返”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。单单根据美英通讯社的报道，从二月以来，每个月都有屠杀朝中被俘人员的事件发生。在这个时期被打死打伤的人数在一千以上。被俘的空降特务的报告和我方被俘人员的来信，都说被打死打伤的有好几千。美方所采用的杀伤战俘的办法是：枪击，使用火焰喷射器、催泪弹、手榴弹和坦克，有时甚至杀头。
    这些血迹斑斑的数字和事实已经表明，尽管美方一年多以来对朝中被俘人员用尽残暴手段，但是他们始终不能动摇这些被俘人员要求回家的意志。美方制造所谓朝中被俘人员不愿回家的惨无人道的骗局，强迫扣留朝中被俘人员，这正是每月都有这种屠杀战俘事件发生的根本原因。
    美国新闻检查的铁幕，不让全世界知道巨济岛和附近各岛的战俘营以及朝鲜大陆上的战俘营中的恐怖情形。美方对于去年发生的屠杀战俘的事件，完全加以新闻封锁。美联社在今年五月才报道了从去年七月以来在巨济岛上至少已有一百一十五个战俘被毒打、绞杀和受酷刑而死。被俘的空降特务说，在今年一月，有一百七十个朝鲜被俘人员被屠杀，因为他们唱“金日成之歌”并且要求遣返。由此看来，在今年的九个月中，每月都有杀伤战俘的事件发生。
    今年六月十日，刽子手波纳为了便于对战俘实行强迫“甄别”而将俘虏分散关入小的营场时，进行了一次大规模的屠杀。在这以后的大约几个月中间，美方又实行了完全的新闻封锁。只是由于朝中方面的揭露，才打开了这个封锁的缺口，迫使美方在八月二十六日透露：自八月初以来，差不多天天都发生打死打伤战俘的事件。
    仅仅在上月最后一星期中，发生的事件就有：八月二十三日，在巨济岛打死打伤十三人；二十四日，在巨济岛打死一人，在朝鲜大陆上的永川打死一人；在马山一名战俘被落岩打死，一名被打伤；二十五日，在朝鲜大陆上的山摩台（译音）打伤一人；二十六日，在巨济岛打伤九人；二十七日，在巨济岛打伤十五人；二十八日，在巨济岛打伤十二人，在济州岛打伤三人；三十日，在巨济岛打伤十六人，一人“上吊自尽”。
    分析一下过去两个月屠杀战俘的消息就可看出，事件的数目不断增加。屠杀的新浪潮正从“死亡之岛”——巨济岛扩大到济州岛和丰安岛以及朝鲜大陆，而据美国将领们说，在这些地方的战俘是“拒绝遣返”的战俘。美方对这些屠杀事件只向新闻记者发布简短的消息。他们故意不发表关于这些战俘的国籍和他们怎样以及为什么被打死打伤的情况。美方对战俘“示威”的性质和他们回家的意志也守口如瓶。
    美军的公告说，屠杀是“联合国军队”进行的，这表示英国和加拿大军队也参与了这些屠杀。
    战俘“自杀”的消息增加了，虽然哈利逊说：“如果遣返战俘，他们就会自杀。”现在已发现有四名战俘“吊死”，最近另有一名战俘在上吊未死之前被解下来。美方未公布这些战俘是为什么“自杀”的。但非常清楚，他们是在美方“不得强迫遣返”的论调下被杀害的。对于战俘来说，“不得强迫遣返”就是死亡或永远作他们敌人的奴隶。
    这些“示威”和屠杀战俘事件，是华盛顿扣留战俘破坏停战谈判的政策的必然结果。每一次打死打伤战俘都提醒世界人民：美方在屠杀战俘方面的罪行，超过了第二次世界大战时期德、日法西斯匪徒的罪行。
