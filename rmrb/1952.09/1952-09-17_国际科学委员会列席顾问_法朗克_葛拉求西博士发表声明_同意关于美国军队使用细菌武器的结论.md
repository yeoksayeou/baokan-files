Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The following is a statement by Dr. Franck Graczyk, a consultant to the International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China (Attachment 44 to the Report of the International Scientific Commission Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China).

    After participating in all the meetings of the International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China in Beijing from August 10 to August 31, 1952, I would like to make the following statement:

    The committee warmly welcomed me as a consultant, and I was able to read all the documents prepared by the committee or submitted by the Chinese and Korean authorities. The members of the committee provided me with more materials and explanations both in meetings and individually. Thanks to the care of the Chinese authorities, I was also able to use the rich library of the Peking Union Medical College.

    During this period, I had the opportunity to have private interactions with many Chinese scientists and to discuss many technical issues with them. I am honored to have had this relationship with them, and I greatly admire their scientific attainments, humanitarianism, and perfect character.

    Based on these experiences, and fully aware of the serious responsibilities undertaken by the International Scientific Commission, I would like to express my agreement with the conclusions in the committee's report, which is that the people of Korea and China have been the object of bacteriological weapons, which have been used by the United States Army. I believe that I am fully qualified to make this statement because, as a bacteriologist, I believe that the work of my Chinese colleagues is impeccable.

    I believe that when I state my hope that a science with a glorious tradition should not be used for the purposes of war, I am correctly expressing the thoughts of microbiologists around the world. We should not forget those predecessors who contributed and even sometimes sacrificed their lives to fight against disease and human suffering.

    国际科学委员会列席顾问
    法朗克·葛拉求西博士发表声明
    同意关于美国军队使用细菌武器的结论
    【新华社十六日讯】调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会列席顾问法朗克·葛拉求西博士的声明（调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书附件四十四）。
    一九五二年八月十日至三十一日期间，在北京参与了国际科学委员会调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实的一切会议以后，我愿意做以下的声明：
    委员会热烈地欢迎我做列席顾问，我并且可以阅读委员会所准备的或中国和朝鲜当局所交给的一切文件。委员会的委员们在会上和个别地都供给了我更多的材料和说明。由于中国当局的照顾我还能够利用中国协和医学院的丰富的图书馆。
    在这个期间我有机会与许多中国科学家作私人交往，并有机会和他们讨论许多技术方面的问题。与他们发生这种关系使我感到光荣，并且使我极钦佩他们的科学造诣、人道主义和完善的人格。
    基于这些体验，同时完全了解国际科学委员会承担的工作所负的严肃责任，我愿意表示同意委员会的报告中的结论，这结论就是说朝鲜和中国人民已成为细菌武器的对象，这些武器是被美国军队所使用的。我认为我自己完全有资格做这个声明，因为我以一个细菌学家的身份相信我的中国同伴的工作是无可非难的。
    我相信当我声明希望不要将一个具有光荣传统的科学用于战争的目的时，我是正确的表达了全世界微生物学家的思想。我们不应该忘记那些贡献甚至有时牺牲生命来向疾病和人类痛苦作斗争的前辈。
    法朗克·葛拉求西（签名）
