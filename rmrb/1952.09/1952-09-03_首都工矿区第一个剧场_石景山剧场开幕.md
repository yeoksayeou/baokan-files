    The First Theater in the Capital's Industrial and Mining Area
    Shijingshan Theater Opens
    [Our Newspaper] The Shijingshan Theater in Beijing has been completed and opened on September 1st. This is the first theater established by the Beijing Municipal People's Government in an industrial and mining area. The theater can accommodate more than 900 audience members and has spacious and clean lounges. More than 700 people attended the opening ceremony, including model workers from various factories and mines, agricultural production experts, and representatives from various government agencies and military units. Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, attended the ceremony and cut the ribbon.
    Wang Yaping, Director of the Cultural Affairs Administration Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He said: The opening of the Shijingshan Theater shows that the capital's cultural and artistic undertakings are developing towards industrial and mining areas. In the future, we must cooperate with the capital's construction plan and build cinemas and theaters in densely populated worker areas in a planned way, so that our cultural and artistic undertakings can better serve the workers, peasants, and working people.
    Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, spoke at the meeting. He said: The working class is the leading class of our country. They have made great achievements in the patriotic production increase and thrift movement, and many heroic models have emerged. The People's Government should not only pay attention to improving their material life, but also improve their cultural life. In the old society, the working people could not enjoy cultural life. For example, there were only good theaters in the cities, and only a few, or even no, theaters in the suburbs and workers' districts. We must change this situation. The opening of the Shijingshan Theater is only the beginning of this change. The facilities of this theater are still rudimentary. In the future, we will gradually build more and better cultural palaces, clubs, theaters, and cinemas for workers and working people. Beijing has started to do this, and all parts of the country should do the same. The people's drama workers should often come to the workers' districts to perform, and take this as their glorious task.
    Cao Yu, Dean of the Beijing People's Art Theater, spoke at the meeting. He represented the Beijing People's Art Theater in guaranteeing to bring good programs to the Shijingshan Theater as soon as possible.
    After the meeting, the Capital Experimental Peking Opera Troupe performed programs to entertain the delegates attending the meeting.

    首都工矿区第一个剧场
    石景山剧场开幕
    【本报讯】北京市石景山剧场现已落成，并于九月一日开幕。这是北京市人民政府在工矿区建立的第一个剧场。该剧场能容九百多观众，并有宽大整洁的休息室。参加开幕典礼的有各厂矿工业劳动模范、农业生产能手和各机关部队代表七百多人。中央人民政府文化部周扬副部长莅会剪彩。
    北京市人民政府文化事业管理处处长王亚平在开幕典礼上首先致词。他说：石景山剧场的开幕，说明了首都的文化艺术事业正在向工矿区域发展。今后我们一定要配合首都的建设计划，有步骤地在工人集居的地区修建电影院和剧院，使我们文化艺术事业更好地为工农劳动人民服务。
    中央人民政府文化部周扬副部长在会上讲话，他说：工人阶级是我们国家的领导阶级，他们在爱国增产节约运动中做出了很大成绩，出现了很多的英雄模范。人民政府不但应注意改善他们的物质生活，而且要改善他们的文化生活。在旧社会，劳动人民是享受不到文化生活的。比如，只有在城市里才有好戏院，郊区、工人区中只有很少的戏棚子，甚至没有。我们必须改变这种情况。石景山剧场的开幕，只是这个改变的开始，这个剧场的设备也还是简陋的，今后，我们要为工人和劳动人民逐步建设起更多更好的文化宫、俱乐部、戏院和电影院。北京市开始这样做了，全国各地都应该这样做。人民的戏剧工作者应经常到工人区来演出，并把这作为自己光荣的任务。
    北京人民艺术剧院院长曹禺在会上讲话，他代表北京人民艺术剧院保证尽早拿好节目到石景山剧场演出。
    会后由首都实验京剧团演出节目，招待与会代表。
