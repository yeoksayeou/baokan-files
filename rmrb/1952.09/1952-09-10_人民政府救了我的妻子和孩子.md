The People's Government Saved My Wife and Children
To the Editor: I wholeheartedly thank the People's Government for saving my wife and children.

My name is Li Nanting, from a poor peasant family. My home is in Zhuangjiaqiao Fengchan Township, Zou City District, Taoyuan County, Hunan. Before liberation, I relied on selling my labor for food, and the suffering I endured was endless. After liberation, thanks to Chairman Mao, I was allocated 3.6 mu of land and two tile-roofed houses. Last year, my wife, Gao Meimei, became pregnant again, which was truly a double blessing.

On August 7th, my wife went into labor. I eagerly awaited the birth of my child, and my heart was filled with indescribable joy. Unexpectedly, my wife had a difficult labor, and only one of the baby's hands came out. The adult was in great pain and fainted three times. I was at a loss and didn't know what to do. It looked like my wife and child's lives were about to be lost.

Later, I remembered that there were work group comrades sent by the People's Government in the village, so I ran to them to ask for help. A comrade from the work group, surnamed Yin, immediately called the Changde Prefectural Health Section and asked the People's Hospital to send a doctor. At this time, half of the heavy stone in my heart was lifted, and I hurried home to comfort my wife. However, when I returned home, she was already unconscious.

Just after noon, a car sped to Zhuangjiaqiao. Three female comrades and one male comrade got out of the car and asked the militiaman Zhuang Jiangbo to take them to my house. They ran under the scorching sun, sweating and panting, and without resting after arriving at my house, they immediately busied themselves with the delivery and treatment. In less than the time it takes to smoke a few pipes, the baby was born, and the adult also woke up. I was so happy that I didn't know what to do, and I couldn't express my gratitude enough. After they finished the delivery, without even drinking a cup of tea, they used the immediate facts to promote the benefits of modern midwifery to the women who came to visit my wife. I thanked them, and they said, "The People's Hospital is here to relieve the suffering of the people, so there is no need to thank us."

The People's Government loves the people in every way, and my wife and I will never forget this kindness in our lifetime. I am a militiaman, and I will resolutely do a good job in maintaining public order, actively engage in production, and support the Volunteer Army to repay the People's Government. My wife lies in bed all day saying, "Thanks to the People's Government for saving me. When I recover, I will definitely work hard in production and promote the benefits of modern midwifery to women."

### 人民政府救了我的妻子和孩子

    人民政府救了我的妻子和孩子
    编辑同志：我衷心感谢人民政府救活了我的妻子和孩子。
    我叫李南廷，贫农成份。家在湖南桃源县陬市区庄家桥丰产乡。解放前，我靠卖工吃饭，受的苦真是说不完。解放后，搭帮毛主席，我分了三亩六分田、两间瓦房。去年，我老婆高么妹又怀了孕，真是喜上加喜。
    八月七日，我老婆临盆了。眼巴巴地望着伢儿快要出世，我心里真是有说不出的高兴。不料，我老婆难产，孩子只下来一只手。大人痛苦万分，昏迷了三次。我没了主意，不知如何是好。我妻、儿两条性命，眼看就保不住了。
    后来，我想起了，村里有人民政府派来的工作组同志，就跑去找他们想办法。工作组一个姓印的同志马上打电话到常德专署卫生科，请人民医院派医生来。这时，我心里的千斤石头放下了一半，赶忙跑回家去安慰老婆。可是，我回到家里时，她已经不省人事了。
    午时刚过，一辆小汽车飞快地开到了庄家桥。从车上下来了三位女同志和一位男同志，找了民兵庄江伯带到我家来。他们在火热的太阳底下跑得汗流浃背、气喘不止，到我家后也顾不上休息，立刻忙着接生、治疗。不到几袋烟的时间，毛伢子就出来了，大人也醒过来了。我高兴得不知怎样了，满心的感激就是说不出来。他们接生完毕，茶都没喝一口，就用眼前的事实向来看望我老婆的妇女们宣传新法接生的好处。我向他们道谢，他们说：“人民医院是替人民解除痛苦的，不用道谢。”
    人民政府处处爱人民，我们两口子一辈子也忘不了这种恩德。我是一个民兵，我要坚决搞好治安工作，积极生产，支援志愿军，来报答人民政府。我老婆躺在床上整天说：“亏得人民政府救了我。我病好了，一定要好好生产，还要向妇女们宣传新法接生的好处。”　　
    李南廷    （印中尧记）
