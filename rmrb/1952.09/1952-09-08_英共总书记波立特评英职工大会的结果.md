Xinhua News Agency, London, September 7th (via TASS): The "Worker's Daily" published an article by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, commenting on the results of the British Trades Union Congress. Pollitt wrote that the congress clearly demonstrated the following three points: (1) The harder the British people work and the more they produce, the poorer they become. (2) Britain's economic situation is constantly deteriorating, as is the case with those American satellite states that are forced to implement arms expansion policies. (3) As long as Britain is tied to American millionaires as a result of the policies of the right-wing leaders of the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, the danger of a third world war is increasing. Pollitt pointed out that all the arguments in support of arms expansion were shattered by Stalin in February 1951 when he responded to Attlee's unfounded slanders against the Soviet Union. Pollitt continued: "The course of events will be determined by the militant actions of those participating in the organized trade union movement, not by the words of the likes of Deakin, Tawney, Williamson, and Lawther. It would be a grave mistake to think that those votes in favor of the General Council's policies reflect the true opinions of the ordinary trade union members, or that these votes can weaken the ordinary members' strength in fighting for increased wages, disarmament, full employment, and peace. At the same time, it must be pointed out that if all those who oppose the General Council's reactionary policies unite, the General Council will be defeated on many important issues." Pollitt elaborated on the principles of united action he put forward at the British Communist Party Congress in April this year. He said: "It is possible to involve all local trade union organizations, shop stewards' committees, and trade union councils in joint action, creating the broadest united mass movement."

    英共总书记波立特评英职工大会的结果
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦六日电：“工人日报”刊载英国共产党总书记波立特评论英国职工大会工作结果的文章。波立特写道：大会清清楚楚地证明了下列三点：（一）英国人民工作得愈努力，生产的东西愈多，他们就愈贫困。（二）英国的经济情况不断恶化，那些被迫实行扩张军备政策的美国附庸国的情形也是一样。（三）只要英国由于职工大会和工党的右翼头子的政策的结果而与美国亿万富翁连在一起，第三次世界大战的危险就在增大着。波立特指出：所有一切支持扩张军备的论据，都被斯大林在一九五一年二月回答艾德礼对苏联的凭空诽谤时粉碎了。波立特继称：“事态的演变将由参加有组织的工会运动的人进行的战斗行动决定，而不是由狄金、陶逊、威廉逊、劳瑟之流的言辞决定的。如果认为赞成最高委员会政策的那些票是反映工会普通会员的真正意见，或者认为这些票能够减弱普通会员争取增加工资、裁减军备、充分就业及和平的力量的话，那就大错特错了。同时必须指出：如果所有反对最高委员会反动政策的人都团结起来，最高委员会在许多重要问题上就会遭到失败。”波立特阐述了今年四月他在英国共产党代表大会上提出的统一行动的原则。他说：“使所有的地方工会组织、车间代表会议和工会理事会参加共同的行动，造成最广泛联合的群众运动，是可能的。”
