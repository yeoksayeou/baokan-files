Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 29th entitled "The American Aggressors'狂轰滥炸Atrocities Will Absolutely Not Subdue the Korean People," stating: The American aggressor army's destructive atrocities of大規模 bombing of the northern region of Korea are becoming increasingly savage and brutal. The American aggressor army is currently carrying out round-the-clock狂轰滥炸of Pyongyang, Hamhung, Wonsan, Chongjin, and many other cities in northern Korea.

    A series of facts prove that the American aggressors' plan to destroy seventy-eight cities in northern Korea, as they have clamored, is being accelerated. In fact, the American aggressor army's indiscriminate bombing atrocities against seventy-eight cities began long ago, and now they are only further exposing their ferocious faces and bestial nature. The American aggressor army's bombing targets are not limited to seventy-eight cities; they are carrying out bestial狂轰滥炸against all cities and thousands of villages and large and small farms, and even barren mountains and wildernesses in the northern region of Korea. The number of times they bomb peaceful rural areas is increasing day by day. Their bombing methods are also becoming more brutal and savage. As a result, peaceful residents, including large numbers of old, weak, women, and children, have been bombed to death and injured in rural areas, fields have been damaged, and various crops that are ripening have suffered great damage.

    The commentary went on to point out: American military aircraft completely target residential areas as their bombing targets. Most of the bombing times are in the middle of the night and at dawn. The aircraft mainly drop heavy bombs weighing 500 kilograms to 1,000 kilograms. The facts prove that the American military's bombing is a planned atrocity aimed at mass slaughter of peaceful residents. This is a provocative act by the American interventionists, attempting to cause greater destruction and disaster to the Korean people in order to achieve their beastly goals.

    The commentary continued: The tenacious will displayed by the Korean people in the two years of war and their heroic struggle have caused the American interventionists to suffer unprecedented military, political, and moral shameful defeats, and have completely bankrupted their sinister conspiracies in the armistice negotiations. In order to salvage their defeat and to retaliate outside the negotiating table, the American aggressors are even more tyrannically制造 making beastly atrocities under the arrogant pretext of "military pressure." After using bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons to massacre large numbers of our captured personnel, they have recently strengthened the so-called "air force offensive." However, any destructive atrocities and any threats or intimidation by the American interventionists will absolutely not make the Korean people fear and submit.

    The commentary emphasized: The continuous slaughter atrocities committed by the aggressors have further aroused the anger of the Korean people. The Korean people have full fighting spirit and determination to defeat the enemy. The backing for the Korean people's heroic struggle is our own strong strength and the unwavering support and solidarity of the growing world peace, democracy, and progressive forces. All progressive mankind resolutely protests and denounces the beastly atrocities of American imperialism and its criminal policy of expanding the war. The Korean people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, resolutely demand that the bloody atrocities of the American interventionists be stopped immediately, and that the organizers of this atrocity be severely punished.

    朝鲜中央通讯社痛斥美国侵略者滥炸暴行
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜中央通讯社二十九日以“美国侵略者狂轰滥炸的暴行绝对屈服不了朝鲜人民”为题发表评论说：美国侵略军大规模轰炸朝鲜北部地区的破坏暴行越来越野蛮、越来越残暴。美国侵略军最近正对平壤、咸兴、元山、清津及朝鲜北部的其他许多城市进行着昼夜不断的狂轰滥炸。
    一连串的事实证明，美国侵略者所叫嚣的毁灭朝鲜北部七十八个城市的计划正在加速地实行着。事实上，美国侵略军对七十八个城市的滥炸暴行在很早以前就已经开始，现在只是更进一步地暴露了它们的凶暴面目和野兽本性。美国侵略军的滥炸目标不只局限于七十八个城市，它们对朝鲜北部地区的所有城市和几千个乡村以及大小农庄甚至荒山旷野，肆行着野兽般的狂轰滥炸。它们对于和平农村的轰炸次数，正在与日俱增。其轰炸的方法也更加残暴与野蛮。因此在农村中也有包括大批老弱妇孺的和平居民被炸死炸伤，田地也遭到了破坏，正在成熟的各种农作物受到了很大的损害。
    评论接着指出：美军飞机完全以居民聚集地带作为它的轰炸目标。轰炸的时间，大多是在深夜和拂晓。飞机投掷的主要是五百公斤到一千公斤的重磅炸弹。事实证明：美军的轰炸是旨在大量屠杀和平居民的有计划的暴行。这是美国干涉者企图借此给朝鲜人民造成更大的破坏和灾难以达到其野兽目的的挑衅行为。
    评论接着说：朝鲜人民在两年来的战争中所显示的顽强意志和他们所进行的英勇斗争，已使美国干涉者遭到空前未有的军事上、政治上及道德上的可耻失败，使它们在停战谈判中的险恶阴谋完全破产。美国侵略者为了挽回它们的失败，为了在谈判的会场外进行报复，竟在“军事压力”的狂妄藉口下更加横暴地制造野兽暴行。它们在使用了细菌武器和化学武器大量屠杀我方被俘人员之后，最近又在加强所谓“空军攻势”。但是，美国干涉者的任何破坏暴行和任何威胁恐吓，都绝对不能使朝鲜人民畏惧和屈服。
    评论强调指出：侵略者连续制造的屠杀暴行，更加激起了朝鲜人民的愤怒。朝鲜人民有着充分的战胜敌人的斗志和决心。朝鲜人民进行英勇斗争的后盾，是我们自己的坚强的实力和日益壮大着的世界和平民主与进步力量坚定不移的支持和声援。全体进步人类坚决抗议和声讨美帝国主义的野兽暴行和扩大战争的罪恶政策。朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决要求迅速制止美国干涉者的血腥暴行，并严惩这种暴行的组织者。
