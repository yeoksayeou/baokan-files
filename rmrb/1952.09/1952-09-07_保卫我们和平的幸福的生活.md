    Defend Our Peaceful and Happy Life
    Industrial Labor Model Hao Jianxiu
    My name is Hao Jianxiu, and I am a female spinner at the Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 6. I was born into a poor family. My father was a carter. After three years of schooling, my family could no longer afford to support me, so I stayed home to help my mother with housework and take care of my younger siblings. Later, our family life became more and more difficult, so I decided to work in a factory to earn some money to support my family. But in the old society, where could poor people find a way out? To work in a factory, you had to find connections and offer gifts. As a result, I ran around everywhere but still couldn't get through the factory gates.

    Fortunately, the great savior of the Chinese people, the Communist Party Chairman Mao, arrived. Less than two months after the liberation of Qingdao, I entered the factory. When I got to the factory, everything seemed new: workers were holding meetings to discuss major factory production matters, and the Communist Party cadres were so kind and particularly concerned about our workers' health. I was very moved and truly felt that things were very different from before. When I was an apprentice, I humbly and diligently learned from the veteran workers and quickly mastered the techniques. At the same time, under the education of the Communist Party, I further realized that our working class is the leading force in our country. Therefore, I was determined to produce well and work hard to create wealth for the country. I patiently studied my profession, worked even harder, and gradually grasped the laws of work. As a result, I made significant achievements in production and maintained a new national record of the lowest roller lap rate of 0.25 percent for seven consecutive months. After the higher authorities discovered my achievements, they attached great importance to them and immediately formed a work group to study my working methods and made a summary, which is now the scientific fine spinning method promoted in textile factories across the country—the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    The Communist Party cultivated and educated me and gave me the greatest honor: On October 1, 1951, I gloriously went to Beijing, the capital, to participate in the National Day celebration and saw with my own eyes our laboring people's great benefactor, Chairman Mao, and the powerful force defending the peace of our motherland—the Chinese People's Liberation Army. After the ceremony I attended, as a non-voting delegate, the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and listened to Chairman Mao's report calling on our people to increase production and practice economy, as well as the reports of the central leaders. On May 1st this year, I gloriously represented our Chinese working class and went to the Soviet Union to participate in the May Day International Labor Day celebration in Moscow and saw with my own eyes the leader of the working people of the world and the banner of world peace, Comrade Stalin. After May Day, I visited several major cities in the Soviet Union to see the great communist construction. These are the two great events in my life that I will never forget. In addition, I received material rewards from the higher authorities—the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, and the Qingdao Municipal Textile Workers' Union—and the Model League Member certificate awarded to me by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. I attribute all these honors to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to our entire working class.

    Furthermore, my family has also changed from its past poor state. My father, who drives a cart, has added another animal to his team, and the family income has greatly increased. We eat white flour for three meals a day, and we eat fish and meat every other day. The whole family is neatly dressed. In addition to busying herself with housework, my mother is particularly busy sewing new clothes for us. Both of my younger brothers are in school, and one of them will graduate from primary school this year and take the entrance exam for middle school. We also have a new house. This year, the People's Government and the factory helped my family build six new sunny houses. Living in such a happy and bright environment, we have indescribable joy. My father and mother are always smiling happily, often saying to me, "Don't forget the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, work hard, and repay the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

    All the workers in our new China, like me, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have been liberated from the slavish life of the past, living a peaceful and happy life. We see our infinitely bright future, and we are building our great and beloved motherland with our labor. We love our peaceful life. But today, in the face of our peaceful construction, the American imperialists are deliberately delaying and obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations, continuing to try to undermine our peaceful life; and they are restoring Japanese militarism, attempting to launch a new war of aggression. Therefore, when the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is about to be held in our capital, I, as an ordinary Chinese worker, make a request to the delegates of all countries at the conference: Our brothers and sisters in Asian and Pacific countries who love peace, let us act together to strive for peace, to defend our peaceful life, to defend our homeland, and to defend our loved ones. I wish the conference a successful outcome.

### 保卫我们和平的幸福的生活

    保卫我们和平的幸福的生活
    工业劳动模范　郝建秀
    我叫郝建秀，是青岛国棉六厂的一个细纱女工。我出身于一个穷人家里，父亲是赶大车的。我上了三年学以后，家里再也没有钱供给我了，就在家帮助母亲干活，看管弟妹。以后家庭生活越来越困难，我就下决心要到厂里做工，挣些钱来养家。但旧社会里那有穷人的出路？到工厂做工也得找门路，托人送礼。结果我到处奔走，还始终不能跨进工厂的大门。
    幸亏来了中国人民的大救星共产党毛主席，青岛解放不到两个月我就进了工厂。进到工厂，一看什么都是新鲜事：工人在开会讨论厂内生产大事，共产党的干部对人这样和气，还特别关心我们工人的身体健康。我受了很大的感动，真感到与以前大不一样了。我在当学徒时，虚心地努力地向老工人学习，很快就学会了技术。同时在共产党的教育下，我进一步地认识到了我们工人阶级是我们国家的领导力量。因此我就下决心要好好生产，努力为国家创造财富。我耐心地钻研业务，工作得更有劲了，逐渐地摸到了工作中的规律，因此我在生产上就有了显著的成绩，连着七个月保持了全国最低皮辊花率百分之零点二五的新纪录。上级发现了我的成绩以后，非常地重视，立刻组成了工作组，研究了我的工作方法，并做出了总结，这就是现在全国各纺织厂推行的科学的细纱工作法——郝建秀工作法。
    共产党培养我、教育我，又给了我最大的荣誉：一九五一年十月一日，我光荣地到首都北京参加了国庆节典礼，亲眼看到了我们劳动人民的大恩人毛主席和祖国的保卫和平的强大力量——中国人民解放军。观礼完毕，我又列席了中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议，听取了毛主席号召我们全国人民增产节约的报告，和中央各位首长的报告。到了今年五月一日，我又光荣地代表我们中国工人阶级去苏联参加了莫斯科“五一”国际劳动节观礼，亲眼看到了全世界劳动人民的领袖，世界和平的旗帜斯大林同志。“五一”过后，我又到苏联几个大城市参观了伟大的共产主义建设。这是我一生中永远忘不了的两件大事。此外，我还得到了上级机关中央人民政府纺织工业部、华东纺织管理局青岛分局、青岛市纺织工会的物质奖励，和青年团中央授予我的模范团员奖状。所有这些光荣，我要归诸于党，归诸于毛主席，归诸于我们全体工人阶级。
    再说我的家庭亦改变了过去穷苦的面貌了。父亲赶大车已添了一头牲口，家庭收入大大增加了。我们每天三餐都吃白面，并且三天两天吃鱼吃肉。全家大小都穿整齐了。我母亲除了忙着料理家务外，还特别忙着给我们缝新衣服。两个弟弟都上了学，一个今年小学毕业后就要考中学。我们也有了新的房子。今年人民政府和工厂方面帮助我家盖起了六间向阳的新屋子。我们一家生活在这样幸福、光明的环境里，真有说不出的喜悦。我父亲母亲成天高兴得笑逐颜开，时常向我说：“你不要忘了共产党，毛主席，好好干活，报答共产党毛主席给咱的恩情。”
    我们新中国的全体工人，都和我一样，在共产党毛主席领导下，从过去牛马不如的奴隶生活里解放了出来，过着和平幸福的生活。我们看到了自己无限美好的前途，我们用自己的劳动建设着我们伟大的可爱的祖国。我们热爱着我们的和平生活。但今天在我们和平建设事业面前，美国帝国主义者却故意拖延阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，继续想破坏我们的和平生活；并正在恢复日本军国主义，企图发动新的侵略战争。因此，当亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将在我们首都召开的时候，我以一个中国普通女工的身份，向大会各国代表提出一个要求：我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平的兄弟姊妹们，一致行动起来，争取和平，为保卫我们的和平生活、保卫我们的家乡、保卫我们的亲人而努力。我在这里预祝大会胜利成功。
