    How to Solve the Learning Problems of Cadres Sent to the Countryside
    —Introducing the Experiences of Xingtai and Xinle Counties in Organizing Learning for Cadres Sent to the Countryside
  　Li Zhiqian
    In the spare-time cultural education of cadres in various places, there is a common problem, that is, cadres sent to the countryside cannot attend classes regularly and cannot persist in cultural learning. This problem has been solved in Xingtai and Xinle counties in Hebei Province.
    In Xingtai and Xinle counties, 60% of the cadres in county-level organizations often stay in the office, occasionally going to the countryside to focus on central tasks; 30% of the cadres sometimes go to the countryside and sometimes return, the time for both being roughly equal; 10% of the cadres often work in districts and villages, spending less than one-third of their time in the office. This shows that a considerable number of cadres do need to go to the countryside frequently, and it is indeed difficult to persist in cultural learning. However, why have they persisted in their spare-time cultural learning?
    Cadres are not completely without time to study during their work in the countryside, nor are they unable to study. The key lies in whether they have the determination to learn. For example, Hu Xide, the head of Xingtai County, went to the countryside three times in three months, spending a month; but because he had the determination to persist in learning, he took textbooks and exercise books with him when he went to the countryside, and took time to calculate the algebra he had chosen. As a result, his learning was not delayed, and his grades were very good. Another example is Li Ruiyin from the Culture and Education Section, who went to the countryside three times in half a year, each time taking about twenty days. His studies were not neglected at all. The reason is that he asked the teacher to teach the lesson before going to the countryside, and also found reference materials to take with him; after going to the countryside, he would read the textbook and do exercises whenever he had time. He completed four exercises in eighteen days, catching up with the school's progress. As soon as the work in the countryside was over, he hurried back to try to attend more classes, in order to minimize absences.
    It is not enough for cadres sent to the countryside to simply have the determination to learn culture, there must also be a set of practical and feasible methods. The cadre spare-time cultural schools in Xingtai and Xinle counties have formulated the following methods based on each cadre's level and the time they spend in the countryside, overcoming the difficulty of cadres sent to the countryside being unable to attend classes regularly:
    (1) Pre-teaching: Before cadres go to the countryside, they ask the teacher to teach the lesson in advance. After going to the countryside, they review and do homework on their own, and submit the homework upon their return.
    (2) Make-up classes: If a cadre must go to the countryside immediately due to an urgent task and does not have time for the teacher to pre-teach, then when they return, their comrades in the group will explain it to them, or they will ask the teacher to give them a make-up class.
    The above two methods are suitable for cadres who spend a relatively short time in the countryside.
    (3) Receiving and submitting lessons: Before cadres go to the countryside, they receive lessons from the teacher according to the length of their time in the countryside and the progress of their studies. That is, the teacher gives key lectures and assigns homework, which the students study on their own in the countryside, submit the homework upon their return, and then the teacher gives key explanations. This allows cadres to basically understand the content of the course.
    (4) Correspondence courses: Teachers compile lecture notes, print and distribute them to cadres who have gone to the countryside, allowing them to study on their own in conjunction with the textbook, and submit homework upon their return. Although this method is not as effective as lecturing, it is very helpful to students.
    (5) Learning stations: Establish learning stations based on complete primary schools, with teachers from complete primary schools serving as consultants to help cadres sent to the countryside learn.
    The above three methods are suitable for cadres who spend a relatively long time in the countryside and have a higher primary school or middle school education.
    According to the situation in Xingtai and Xinle counties, the longest time that students spend in the countryside each time is about a month, during which the progress of the course is no more than three or four lessons; if they spend half a month in the countryside, they will miss only one or two lessons. If efforts can be made to ensure that students study diligently, they can catch up with the progress.

    怎样解决下乡干部的学习问题
    ——介绍邢台、新乐两县组织下乡干部学习的经验
  　李之乾
    在各地干部业余文化教育中，普遍存在着一个问题，这就是下乡的干部不能经常到课，不能坚持文化学习。这个问题已在河北省邢台、新乐两县得到解决。
    邢台、新乐两县的县级机关中有百分之六十的干部经常住机关，偶而下乡去突击中心工作；有百分之三十的干部时而下乡、时而回来，二者的时间约略相等；有百分之十的干部经常在区、村工作，留在机关内的时间不到三分之一。这说明的确有相当多的干部要经常下乡，坚持文化学习确有不少困难。但是，他们的业余文化学习为什么又坚持下来了呢？
    干部在下乡工作期间，并不是完全没有时间学习的，也不是不能学习的，关键在于他有没有学习的决心。如邢台县长胡希德曾在三个月内，下乡三次，费时一月；但因他有坚持学习的决心，下乡时带着课本、练习本，抽空就演算自己选修的代数，结果，学习不但没有耽误，而且成绩很好。又如文教科李瑞音，半年内曾下乡三次，每次来回二十来天，功课一点也没有荒废。原因是他在下乡前请教员教了课，又找了参考材料带在身边；下乡后，一有空暇就看课本，演习题，在十八天内演算了四个习题，赶上了学校的进度。在乡间的工作一结束，又急忙赶回来，争取多上一课，以尽量减少缺课。
    仅仅是下乡干部有学习文化的决心还不够，还必须有一套切实可行的办法。邢台、新乐两县干部业余文化学校即根据每个干部的程度、下乡时间，订出了如下的办法，克服了下乡干部不能经常到课的困难：
    （一）预讲：干部下乡前请教员预先讲课，下乡后由自己复习、做作业，回来交作业。
    （二）补课：如干部因任务紧急，必须立即下乡，来不及让教员预讲时，则等回来后由小组同志给他讲解，或请教员补课。
    以上两种办法，适用于下乡时间较短的干部。
    （三）领课、交课：干部下乡前，按其下乡时间的长短和学习的进度向教员领课。即由教员作重点讲授，指定作业，由学员下乡自学，回来后交作业，再由教员作重点讲解。这样可使干部能在基本上领会课程的内容。
    （四）函授：教员编出讲课的教案，印发给下了乡的干部，让他们结合课本进行自学，回来后交作业。这种办法虽然不如讲课的作用大，但对学员是很有帮助的。
    （五）学习站：以完全小学为基础，建立学习站，由完全小学的教员担任顾问，帮助下乡干部学习。
    以上三种办法，可适用于下乡时间较长，而有高小、中学程度的干部。
    根据邢台、新乐两县的情况来看，学员每次下乡的时间最长的约一个月，其间课程的进度最多不过三、四课；如果下乡半个月，所误不过一、两课，如果能设法使学员认真学习，是可以赶上进度的。
