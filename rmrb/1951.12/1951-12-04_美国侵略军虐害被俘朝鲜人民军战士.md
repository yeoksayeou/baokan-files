    American Aggressor Troops Abuse Captured Korean People's Army Soldiers
    Korean People's Army Soldier Cui Hanjun
    I was unfortunately captured by the enemy on the battlefield while fighting back against them. Later, I escaped after experiencing near-death circumstances.
    This August, a fierce battle unfolded on an unnamed hilltop on the central front.
    The enemy, in an attempt to break through our lines, launched a frantic counter-offensive under the cover of dozens of tanks and numerous aircraft and artillery. At this time, the soldiers in my squad were all hidden on the right-hand side of the hilltop. Shells rained down like drops of water. Despite the enemy’s frenzy, their attack was beaten back after fierce fighting.
    At that moment, the disorganized enemy began to bombard our position with intensity, also launching smoke bombs. The hilltop and hillside we were defending were quickly engulfed in smoke, obscuring the view of anyone. Shells exploded all around us. I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was no longer on the hilltop, but in a trench. Two other comrades were with me. We had all been captured after being wounded.
    The American troops and the "National Defense Forces" (Syngman Rhee bandit army) treated us, the captured soldiers struck by shrapnel and on the verge of death, with murderous intent. They kicked us hard with their leather shoes.
    They took us back to “Headquarters.”
    On the way, one comrade had severe pain in his leg, walked with a limp, and fell behind. At that moment, an American devil grew impatient, took the automatic rifle hanging around his neck, aimed at that seriously wounded comrade, and fired a shot. He died immediately.
    The rest of us, on the way, were kicked with leather shoes and hit with gun butts as we were driven to "Headquarters."
    Two American officers, accompanied by two “military police,” called the two of us to them, asked a few bullshit questions, and then turned ferocious. One of them raised a pistol and, with a "bang," shot down the comrade who was standing there holding my hand.
    He rolled his murderous eyes, and a group of beasts said something incomprehensible. Later, they pushed me onto a truck, I didn't know where they were taking me.
    We arrived at a large building resembling a warehouse, surrounded by five layers of barbed wire and two to three sentry posts.
    After getting out of the car, I immediately smelled a bloody stench. I was locked in a dark room crammed with farmers, women, old people, and children.
    My body hurt more and more. I wanted to lie down slightly in the corner of the wall, and suddenly felt that I was pressing on a wet and sticky thing. It turned out that a person covered in blood was lying there.
    "Humph! Humph!..." He groaned.
    At night, I estimated it to be twelve o'clock. Murderous guards broke in and dragged me out, taking me to an interrogation room.
    As soon as I entered the door, I was met head-on by a murderous butcher wearing military boots, standing there with his legs in an "X" shape. Around him were buckets, whips, wooden sticks, and a red-hot charcoal stove. On top of the stove were iron bars, as well as some strange electrical devices.
    After a while, I also saw a man of about twenty-five or six years old and another woman of about twenty years old, lying there covered in blood. Judging from their appearance, they were probably dead or were breathing their last.
    My interrogation began. First, they simply asked my name, address, age, and so on. The “military police” then picked up a whip and lashed me hard. After whipping me enough, they kicked me. Finally, they used a red-hot iron bar to pierce holes in my body, making "squeaking" sounds as it burned.
    The next morning at nine o'clock, I was somewhat more conscious.
    When I walked out of the interrogation room, I realized that this was a familiar place. The address of this house was clearly near Gapyeong, where our People's Army annihilated the Syngman Rhee bandit army and pressed towards Seoul on June 26th and 27th last year.
    The next day, I suffered the same torture again. On the third day, my head was broken and I lost five teeth.
    The women carrying babies were even more miserable. Their faces were pale, and their sunken, open eyes were desperately searching for food. However, the beastly troops did not even allow them to drink water. The people imprisoned there were all longing for the day when they could leave this living hell, constantly waiting for an opportunity to escape.
    Two weeks later, I continued to be taken out for interrogation.
    One afternoon, many of us, including me, were dragged out and taken south. It was said that we would be sent to a "prisoner of war camp." I thought to myself, the opportunity has come.
    The sun had set behind the western mountains. It was getting dark. The car was driving uphill, and the speed slowed down a bit. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I became nervous and jumped out of the car unprepared. The enemy fired at me with automatic rifles. The enemy wanted to stop the car to chase me, but suddenly stopped. Perhaps they were afraid that they could not keep an eye on the other prisoners, so they did not chase me.
    I ran while avoiding the bullets, and finally climbed up the mountain to hide. A few days later, I crossed the enemy's strict cordon line to find our army's defensive line. Thanks to the fact that I had been there last year, I was still familiar with the terrain. After staying for some days, our ambush team rescued me and sent me back to the rear.
    Whether it is the American troops or the "National Defense Forces," they brutally abuse prisoners of war. Once our soldiers are captured, it is as if they have left the human world. It is cheap if they die completely in their hands. Their severe torture is extremely brutal.
    I have now returned to the warm embrace of the motherland. Whenever I think of that hellish life, I cannot suppress the fire of revenge burning in my heart. I want revenge! They will never be able to repay this blood debt. (Translated from the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" of October 22)

    美国侵略军虐害被俘朝鲜人民军战士
    朝鲜人民军战士  崔汉俊
    我在反击敌人的战场上，不幸被敌人俘虏了去。后来，从九死一生里才脱逃了出来。
    今年八月，在中部战线的一个无名高地上展开了一场炽烈的战斗。
    敌人为了突破我军防线，在数十辆坦克和许多飞机、大炮的掩护下，疯狂地进行反冲锋。这时，我班里的战士都埋伏在右侧的高地里。炮弹像雨点似地落下来。尽管敌人如此疯狂，但是经过了一场激战，敌人的进攻还是被打退了。
    这时，混乱了的敌人，就向着我们埋伏的地点猛烈轰击；同时还发射了烟幕弹。我们据守的高地和山腰，片刻之间便烟雾弥漫，对面看不见人。炮弹在我们的周围爆炸开来。我失去了知觉。待我醒来时一看，已经不是在高地上，而是在一个战壕里。还有两位同志和我在一起。我们都是负伤后被俘的。
    美军和“国防军”（李承晚匪军），对待我们已经中了弹片、伤重濒危的俘虏是杀气腾腾的。他们用皮鞋狠狠地踢我们。
    他们把我们带回“本部”。
    途中，一位同志腿部剧痛，一摇一摆地走着，而且走得很慢，所以老是掉在后面。这时，一个美国鬼子不耐烦了，将挂在脖子上的自动步枪取下，对准那位重伤的同志，狠狠地打了一枪。他马上死了。
    剩下我们二人，一路上，被他们用皮鞋踢着，用枪托打着，赶到了“本部”。
    两名美军军官带领着两名“宪兵”，把我们两人叫到跟前，略问了我们几句狗屁话，就凶狠起来了。其中一个举起手枪，“呯”的一声，把和我手拉手站在那里的同志打倒了。
    他翻了一翻杀人的鬼眼，一群野兽不知在讲些什么。后来，把我推上卡车，不知要送向何处。
    到了一个类似仓库的大房子，周围有五层铁丝网，有二道至三道岗哨。
    我下车之后，马上闻到了一股血腥的气味。我被关进了一间黑暗的屋子里，里面挤满了农民，妇女，老人和小孩。
    我的身体越痛越厉害了，我想在墙角上稍微躺一下，忽然觉得压着了一个湿粘粘的东西，原来是一个血水淋漓的人躺在那里。
    “哼！哼！……”他呻吟起来了。
    夜晚，我估计是十二点了。杀气满面的监视兵闯进来，将我拖出去，拉到审问室里。
    我刚一进门口，迎头遇见一个穿着军靴的杀人屠夫，两腿成“乂”字形地站在那里。他的四周，尽是一些水桶、皮鞭、木棒，还有烧得通红的炭火炉，火炉上面放着铁条，此外还有一些奇奇怪怪的电气装置。
    稍过一会，我又看到一位约二十五、六岁的男人和另一位约二十岁的女人，血淋淋地躺在那里。看样子，可能是死了，或是正在咽气。
    对我的审问开始了。先简单地问了我的姓名，住址，年龄等等。“宪兵”就拿起皮鞭子狠狠地抽我。用鞭子打够了，又用脚踢。最后用烧红了的铁条，在我身上穿窟窿，烧得“吱吱”的直响。
    第二天早晨九点钟，我多少清醒了一些。
    在我从审问室里走出来时，发觉这里正是我熟悉的地方。这间房子的地址，分明是在去年六月二十六、七日，我们人民军歼灭了李承晚匪军，进迫汉城的加平附近。
    第二天，我又遭受同样的毒刑。第三天，头也被打破了，还掉了五颗牙齿。
    携带婴儿的妇女更为悲惨。她们脸色苍白，张开的深陷下去的两眼，无望地在搜寻食品。可是，兽军竟连水都不许喝。那里被囚禁的人们，都在渴望着有一天能离开这个人间地狱，无时不在待机逃脱。
    两星期后，我又继续被提出审问。
    有一天午后，我们许多人中，又有几名被拖出去，包括我在内，带向南方去了。据说要将我们送到“俘虏收容所”里。我心想，机会来了。
    太阳已下西山。天渐渐暗下来。车行驶在上坡路上，速度减慢了些。利用这个机会，我心里一紧张，趁敌不备，跳下车就跑。敌人用自动步枪向我猛射。敌人想停车追赶我，忽然又不停了。可能他们唯恐看守不住其他的俘虏，所以没有追赶我。
    我且跑且避子弹，最后爬上了高山藏好。几天后，我穿过敌人森严的警戒线，去找寻我军的防线。多亏去年我到过那里，地形还熟。住了些日子，我们的伏击组搭救了我，将我送回后方。
    不论美军或是“国防军”，都残暴地虐待俘虏。我们的战士一旦被俘，就等于离开了人间。如果在他们手里完整地死去，还算便宜的。他们的严刑拷打是残暴透顶的。
    我现在已重新回到了祖国温暖的怀抱。每当我想起那一段地狱生活时，心中就抑制不住燃烧起复仇之火。我要报仇！他们永远也还不清这个血海深仇。（并多译自十月二十二日朝鲜“劳动新闻”）
