Comrades,

The issue I want to talk about today is about opposing corruption and degeneration, and opposing bureaucratism.

Why is this issue being raised?

As everyone knows, our Party, after thirty years of glorious, great, and arduous struggle, finally led the Chinese people to defeat domestic and foreign enemies, achieved victory in the Chinese revolution, and established the People's Republic of China. Our Party is continuing to lead the people of the whole country in building and consolidating their own country.

As everyone also knows, in recent years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the Party organizations in the Northeast region have achieved successes in economic construction, and work in various positions has also been successful.

This is the glory of the Chinese people, the glory of Chairman Mao, the glory of the Party, and the glory of countless comrades who are hardworking, simple, and wholeheartedly striving for the cause of the Party and the people!

However, the victory of the Chinese revolution does not equate to the completion of the Chinese revolutionary cause. On the contrary, with the victory of the Chinese revolution on a national scale, the responsibilities borne by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are becoming even greater.

As Chairman Mao taught us, seizing national victory is only "the first step in a ten-thousand-mile long march." The task for the future is to "build a prosperous and strong country," which means to "establish a strong national defense force" and "establish a strong economic force." Only in this way can we further consolidate our country, so that it is free from imperialist aggression; only in this way can we transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country; and only in this way can we steadily lead our social system towards socialism-communism, which is the goal for which we communists are fighting.

However, after the nationwide revolutionary victory and the Northeast's transition to focusing on economic construction, a large number of staff members from old institutions and enterprises have transferred to work in the people's institutions and enterprises. Among them, the majority have begun to establish the idea of serving the people after education and transformation, but there are also some who have been poorly transformed, or even not transformed at all, continuing the corrupt practices of the Kuomintang reactionaries. At the same time, various奸商 [cunning merchants] and remnants of the reactionary classes are also adopting various means of seduction and deception, attempting to soften the resolve of those unstable elements in our ranks. Indeed, some of our Party members, and even individual veteran cadres, cannot withstand this temptation and fall into the quagmire, resulting in serious tendencies towards corruption and degeneration, corroding the revolutionary ranks and hindering the connection between the Party and the masses of the people. This is an extremely serious problem, and if it is not thoroughly resolved, it will harm the people and the revolution.

Among these corrupt elements, the most serious have fallen deep into the quagmire, completely losing the qualities of a communist and degenerating into thieves who steal the property of the state and the people. In order to cover up their despicable behavior and win "sympathizers," these degenerate elements are fabricating various excuses. Such as saying: "Having moved from the countryside to the city, one must be more particular in order to adapt to the new environment"; "Socializing is necessary to do united front work"; "The household items in my home were obtained through production, so it's nothing to use a little myself"; and if they are criticized, they will say that others have a "rural perspective" and are "paying attention to trivial details of life," and so on. They are afraid of democracy, and they try their best to use these "reasons" to suppress and crack down on the masses' criticism and exposure of their stealing behavior. The broad masses of Party members and cadres certainly do not recognize these "reasons," but there are indeed a few naive comrades who have been captured by these "reasons" and cannot conduct the necessary struggle against them.

Certain Party members and cadres have been infected with serious vulgarized views and work styles of landlords, compradors, feudal bureaucrats, and other non-working classes. Their view of revolutionary victory is not like what Comrade Stalin said: seizing power is "only the beginning of the proletarian revolution," but they consider it to be the "end" of the revolution. As a result, they become arrogant and complacent, lose vigilance politically, fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and appoint people based on personal relationships with extreme lack of principles, even bringing counter-revolutionaries into revolutionary institutions and protecting these people. For example, one minister in our Northeast People's Government, without organizational approval, successively recruited sixteen relatives and friends as cadres, including four who had betrayed the Party, three who were members of reactionary parties and groups or had serious political suspicions, two landlords who had been struggled against and fled, and three who had been fired from their previous jobs for bad character. He was fully aware of the political situation of these people beforehand. Another example is a cadre who served as a deputy bureau chief in the government, who also privately introduced six relatives and friends to work in his bureau, four of whom have been found to have political problems. For example, his younger brother was the "suppression" team leader with major blood debts, but he appointed him as a supply clerk in the bureau and planned to promote him to section chief. Another example is a bureau chief of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, who assigned Zhang Hanjie, a former Kuomintang artillery battalion commander introduced by the prisoners' reform team, as an engineering team leader. Zhang conducted counter-revolutionary activities in the engineering team and was executed by the People's Government, but he still expressed nostalgia, saying: "Zhang's work was really active." At the same time, he also protected Wang, who had close ties with the puppet Central Bureau of Statistics special agents and performed very poorly, insisting that he "is not a political problem, but ideologically backward."

This view is also reflected in the tendency to neglect politics that has emerged among some Party members and cadres. They are unwilling to participate in Party life, do not value theoretical study, and say: "Opening Party meetings is a waste of time, how can there be time for these idle pastimes?" They even refuse to do Party work, considering it to be "bullying honest people" when assigned to Party branch work, using the excuse of learning technology to neglect or oppose theoretical study, saying "You can work without studying politics, but you can't eat without learning technology." Precisely because they are so disgusted with politics and hate Party organizational life, many of their wrong ideas cannot be corrected and become even more developed.

Comrades! Where has the communist principle of these people gone? I ask you! Is this permissible for a communist?

Are these problems serious? There is no doubt that they are very serious.

What is its nature? It is bringing the ideology, lifestyles, and work styles of landlords, bureaucrats, compradors, and other non-working classes into our Party. These things are fundamentally in conflict with Marxism-Leninism, in conflict with the title of a communist, and in conflict with the ideology and work style of the working class. It is a toxin that corrodes the Party, something that the Party's enemies and the people love, and if it is not overcome in time and allowed to develop, it will erode the Party's combat effectiveness and prevent the Party's cause from moving forward. Therefore, the entire Party must be organized to wage a resolute struggle against this kind of thinking and thoroughly overcome it.

Why can this serious phenomenon exist in our revolutionary ranks? In addition to some impure elements mixing into the Party organization, and the retention of many people who have not undergone thorough ideological transformation in various departments of the People's Government, it is also due to the changes in the thinking and emotions of a very small number of older Party members (such as the development of complacency and the desire for enjoyment). In particular, it should be pointed out that bureaucratism in leading organs at all levels, lax organization, insufficient Marxist-Leninist education, failure to properly develop criticism and self-criticism, and poor inspection work have led to a liberal attitude towards the above-mentioned ideological tendencies, and even a policy of appeasement towards those corrupt and degenerate elements, saying "educate them slowly, don't be impatient." This has given those corrupt and degenerate elements an opportunity to exploit.

Here I am prepared to talk about the situation of bureaucratism in certain organs at the Northeast first level.

We have some institutions, we have some leading comrades, they have been contaminated with a strong bureaucratic habit, they pay attention to the decoration of the form, for example, the number of American and British cars on the streets of Shenyang has increased, and the situation of giving gifts and inviting guests has also increased. It seems that one cannot work without taking British and American cars, one is not enough to show revolutionary love without giving gifts, and if you don't treat guests, it's not enough to show the achievements of the meeting.

As for the situation of work, then, some of our units are not as "active" as they are for cars and invitations.

A decree on organizing fishermen's trade unions from one of our Northeast People's Government agencies travelled through the agency for four months and has not yet been announced.

The chief of staff of one of our troops issued an order that was signed by himself, but he neither checked it nor even remembered the order.

There is a health agency where several boxes of medical equipment have rusted and they don't even know it, and they don't even know that the drugs have gone bad.

The airport director of one of our airports reported that "the airport was reportedly flooded," but the airport was not flooded at all, because he was "reportedly" told. Comrades, think about it, the director of the airport lives in the airport and still needs to be "reportedly" told, please see, to what extent has our bureaucratism reached!

As for the situation of agencies arbitrarily adding people, arbitrarily adding furniture, arbitrarily receiving family members, and arbitrarily hiring nannies, there are even more. In some units, the lack of cherishment of public property has reached an alarming level. The facts that formalism, perfunctory performance, copying documents, routine affairs, indiscriminate issuance of documents and forms, failure to check, and failure to solve problems in the work of certain agencies have turned the revolutionary agencies that serve the people into bureaucratic agencies that are lifeless, uncreative, talking empty words, and issuing orders indiscriminately are also too numerous to mention.

These bureaucrats are simply turning a blind eye to the theft of state wealth and the encroachment of public property. They never conduct even the most basic inspections and investigations of these criminal acts. They are just like what Comrade Stalin said:

"They seem to be blind, they can't see these facts, thinking that 'there is nothing particularly remarkable here'. But these comrades are very wrong. Just as the foundation of capitalism is private ownership, the foundation of our Soviet system is public ownership. If the capitalists at that time consolidated the capitalist system by announcing the sacred and inviolable private property, then we communists should more declare the sacred and inviolable public property to consolidate the new socialist economic forms in all production and commercial sectors. Allowing the theft of public property, allowing the encroachment of public property, whether it is state property or the property of cooperatives and collective farms, and ignoring this counter-revolutionary madness, is helping the enemy to destroy our Soviet system based on public ownership." (Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction, Volume 2, page 576)

Comrades! In our country it is the same, allowing the theft of state property, allowing the corrupt and wasteful madness, is allowing the destruction of the material foundation of our country, is allowing the destruction of our connection with the masses of the people, this kind of behavior, this kind of style, can it be allowed to continue to exist?

Comrades, is it not obvious that it is necessary to eliminate the bureaucratic style of our leading organs at all levels?

In order to eliminate the tendency of corruption and degeneration and oppose bureaucratism, the following measures should be taken:

(1) A mass democratic movement should be launched in all agencies, without exception, to expose the ideological and behavioral aspects of corruption and degeneration and the bureaucratic style within the agency and in the relevant departments and all personnel. This movement should be led personally by the responsible comrades of each agency and carried out with preparation. That is, first collect materials to make a report, call on those who have committed such errors to confess and repent automatically, call on the masses to expose and report, and ensure that all personnel thoroughly understand that corruption and degeneration is the ugliest and most shameful behavior in the revolutionary ranks, and recognize the harm of this kind of thinking and behavior to the Party and the country, so that everyone understands that "a great enemy is at hand, and it is necessary to defeat it," so that any corrupt and degenerate elements have no hiding place in the revolutionary ranks, forming an atmosphere of "rats running across the street, everyone shouting to beat them." Only in this way can this struggle be carried out thoroughly. The responsible comrades of each agency (especially financial and economic agencies) must carry out this movement to the end with the most resolute attitude, and must not be interrupted. Only in this way can our cadres be healthy and our cause move forward.

To make this movement develop well, we must do a good job of education; we must link this movement with Party consolidation and education. In the Party members and the masses, combined with the facts revealed in this movement, specifically explain how to be a communist and what the Party spirit of a communist should be; explain that what corrupt and degenerate elements like is exactly what we oppose, and what they hate and fear is exactly what we need to strengthen. Use newspapers, radio, plays, cartoons, and comparisons between good and bad to explain how every Party member and every revolutionary worker should fight against theft and how to fight against bureaucratism. If this work is done well, it can powerfully promote this movement, greatly improve the political awareness of Party members and the masses, improve their sense of responsibility to protect public assets, and improve the work style of our agencies, so that the political outlook of our agencies will be renewed. This work is long-term and should be done repeatedly.

As Comrade Stalin said:

"We must conduct a systematic struggle against theft, and against the so-called 'happy' theft in our state organs, cooperatives, and trade unions. As the newspapers say, there are shameful hidden thefts; there are brave 'happy' thefts. Not long ago, I read an article by Ognev in the 'Komsomolskaya Pravda' about 'happy' thefts. It seems that there is such a suave figure - a young man with a small beard, who happily steals things in one of our organs, he steals things systematically and constantly, and he steals very successfully. What is more noteworthy here is not the thief himself, but the fact that the surrounding masses, knowing the thief, not only do not fight him, but on the contrary, pat him on the shoulder and praise his cleverness, so that the thief becomes a hero in people's eyes. Comrades, this is noteworthy, this is also the most dangerous. When an enemy agent or a traitor is caught, the anger of the masses is limitless, and they all demand to be shot. But when a thief is active in everyone's eyes, stealing state property, the surrounding masses are limited to a kind smile and a pat on the shoulder. It is very clear that the thief who steals the people's property and damages the interests of the national economy is also an enemy agent and a traitor, if not worse. Finally, this suave little dove with a small beard was arrested. But what is the significance of arresting a 'happy' thief? We have thousands and tens of thousands of such thieves, and you cannot eliminate them all by relying on the National Security Department. Here we need other, more effective and more serious methods. This method is to create a general moral resistance and an atmosphere of hatred among the surrounding masses around these thieves. This method is to launch a movement among workers and peasants to create a spiritual atmosphere that excludes the possibility of theft, so that thieves who steal the people's property, whether 'happy' or 'unhappy', cannot live and exist. Eliminating theft is one of the means to protect our accumulation and avoid waste - that is the task." (Stalin: On the Soviet Economic Form and the Party's Policies: Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction, Volume 2, pages 69-70)

At the same time, in order to attract the broad masses of Party members and non-Party members to participate in this movement and give play to their enthusiasm, we must fully promote democracy and make this movement a democratic movement for checking work, checking ideas, and checking work styles. It should be announced that all Party members and non-Party members have the right to accuse any Party member and cadre to all agencies and all responsible comrades, and any act of suppressing this right of all Party members and the masses is not allowed, otherwise they should be punished.

Because without doing so, it is impossible to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Chairman Mao said:

"The so-called giving play to enthusiasm cannot be just empty words, it must be specifically manifested in the creativity, sense of responsibility, work activity, willingness and ability to raise questions, express opinions, criticize shortcomings of the leading organs, cadres, and Party members, as well as the supervisory role of the leading organs and leading cadres from the perspective of care, and so on. Without these, the so-called enthusiasm is empty. And the play of these enthusiasms depends on the democratization of the Party's internal life system, and without or lacking democratic life, the purpose of giving play to enthusiasm cannot be achieved." ("The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War")

In addition, in order to make this movement carried out correctly and receive the greatest effect, it is also necessary to educate all Party members and non-Party members to be realistic, the method should be appropriate, prevent exaggeration and framing, and be vigilant against sabotage elements taking the opportunity to act.

(2) Those corrupt and degenerate elements who have been exposed and reported in the movement with conclusive evidence must be dealt with in an extremely serious manner, and any attitude of appeasement and forgiveness is wrong and is a crime against the revolution. Because if this is not done, it is equivalent to condoning bad people and encouraging people to do bad things.

When dealing with these incorrigible corrupt and degenerate elements, we must learn from Lenin's correct attitude. Lenin said:

"In any great revolution in history, the people have instinctively felt this point, and have expressed their determination to eliminate evil by executing thieves on the spot. The misfortune in previous revolutions lies in the fact that the revolutionary enthusiasm that kept the masses tense and able to ruthlessly suppress the corrupt elements did not last long. The social reason, that is, the class reason, for this instability of the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm at that time was the weakness of the proletariat itself. Only the proletariat (if it already has a sufficient number, sufficient awareness, and sufficient discipline) is the only one who can absorb the majority of the exploited laborers (if it is simpler and more popular, that is, the majority of the poor) to its side, and can fully and long-term hold the power to completely suppress all exploiters and all corrupt elements." (Lenin and Stalin "On Socialist Economic Construction" page 132)

In front of those who have committed the errors of corruption, there are two roads: one is to repent and start anew, and work for the people again; the other is to continue to be bad and be spurned by the Party and the people. Which way to go, they must choose themselves. However, it is impossible to do bad things and pretend to be doing good things, not lose the "Party ticket," and be corrupt and corrupt and be free from legal punishment. Using the position of a Party member and the powers of the state organs to do bad things is absolutely not allowed by the Party and the people. Therefore, those who are seriously involved and incorrigible must be given strict sanctions in accordance with the laws of the country, and expelled from the Party. The rest should be dealt with separately according to the severity of the circumstances and the degree of repentance, according to Party discipline and law. Those who confess automatically should have their sentences reduced for the serious ones and exempted for the minor ones; those who have consistently been corrupt or who have been reported for a large amount of corruption but still do not confess and repent should be severely punished. Regarding the handling of赃物 [stolen goods], in principle, they must be recovered. Those who have wasted a part that cannot be fully recovered should be dealt with according to the specific circumstances. In the future, all corruption cases that need to be sent to the judicial organs for handling should be sent to the judicial organs for handling, and cannot be handled by just criticizing them in the agency.

In the future, the Party's discipline inspection committees and the government's supervisory committees should inspect this aspect of the problem in a planned and organized manner, and in the near future, they should concentrate their efforts to fight against corruption and degeneration and bureaucratic tendencies.

(3) When dealing with corrupt and degenerate elements, we should also simultaneously commend and reward those who have a high degree of dedication and creativity, are honest and self-disciplined, resolutely safeguard the interests of the state and the people in industry, agriculture, and other aspects, and actively create wealth for the country and the people, fighting heroes, advanced workers, model farmers, model technicians, model youth, model women, model revolutionary workers, and model Party and non-Party cadres. For these people, we must actively encourage them to move forward and dare to promote them to appropriate positions. The promotion of these advanced model figures should be as resolute as the dismissal and punishment of those corrupt and degenerate elements, in order to promote justice and eliminate evil winds. Here we must remember Chairman Mao's words, he said:

"Communists in government work should be models of being very honest, not using private individuals, doing more work, and taking less remuneration. Communists in mass movements should be friends of the masses, not superiors of the masses, teachers who tirelessly teach people, not bureaucratic politicians. Communists should never put personal interests first, and personal interests should be subordinate to the interests of the nation and the masses. Therefore, selfishness, passive怠工 [loafing on the job], corruption, and the limelight are the most despicable. And the spirit of being selfless, active effort, self-denial, and hard work is worthy of respect." ("The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War")

(4) In this movement, the work and leadership style of each agency should be given a serious inspection without exception, and fire must be opened on all kinds of bureaucratism, because it is the hotbed where the toxins of corruption can grow. To eliminate the tendency of corruption, we must also eliminate bureaucratism. The phenomenon of perfunctory work, only talking empty words, being unrealistic,饱食终日, 无所用心 [eating one's fill all day long and doing nothing] in some agencies must be brought to an end, and replaced by a lively, realistic spirit of work and work style.

Therefore, the work of each agency should be inspected and judged with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The actual results of the work should be checked, and it should be checked whether the provisions of various systems are appropriate and how they are implemented, so as to revise, enrich, and establish various systems that must be established.

In the future, once the system is established, it must be resolutely implemented, and no one can violate it. For example: dealings with merchants, agency production, living treatment, personnel administration, use of cars, receiving family members, use of nannies, etc., must have certain systems, and cannot be done each in one's own way (in the future, family members who are received with approval, except for the old and weak, must participate in labor and implement the principle of no labor, no food).

Once the system is stipulated, the responsibility system at all levels must be implemented, and responsibilities must not be shirked from each other.

Regarding the issue of opposing bureaucratism, Comrade Stalin said: "The danger of bureaucratism is, first, that bureaucratism buries and hides the countless possibilities in our system, does not use them, attempts to turn the creativity of the masses into nothing, locks them in the 사무房 [administration office], and turns every new start of the Party into a petty and boring greed. Second, the danger of bureaucratism is that bureaucratism cannot stand the examination of the implementation situation, it attempts to turn the main instructions of the leading organs into empty words on paper that are completely divorced from actual life. Not only the old bureaucrats who are drilled in our organs are dangerous, but the new bureaucrats, the Soviet bureaucrats, are also dangerous, and even more dangerous than the old bureaucrats. As for the 'communist' bureaucrats in the Soviet bureaucrats, they also play a great role. I am talking about some 'communists' who use the orders and 'instructions' of the office (they believe in the power of these things as if they believe in idols) to replace the creativity and automatism of tens of millions of workers and peasants.

The task here is to overthrow the bureaucratism in our organs and organizations, eliminate the 'morality' and 'habits' of bureaucratism, and clear the road to use the possibilities in our system and develop the creativity and independence of the masses.………

In the struggle against bureaucratism, the work of the Party is carried out in four aspects: developing self-criticism, examining the degree of implementation of various works, cleaning up the organs, and promoting loyal workers from the working class from below to the organs." (Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction, Volume 2, pages 473-474)

Regarding the importance of checking work and criticism, as Comrade Stalin said:

"It is said that the winners should not be judged, should not be criticized, should not be checked. This is not right. The winners can and must be judged, can and must be criticized and checked. This is not only beneficial to the cause, but also beneficial to the winners themselves: then they will be less proud and more humble. ... If our Communist Party is afraid of criticism and inspection, then it will not be of much value. ..." ("Comrade Stalin's speech at the Moscow City Stalin Electoral District Voters' Assembly on February 9, 1946")

As Chairman Mao said in the report to the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China:

"Whether there is a serious self-criticism is also one of the significant marks that distinguishes us from other political parties. We have said that the house should be cleaned regularly, and if it is not cleaned, it will be filled with dust. The face should be washed regularly, and if it is not washed, it will be covered with dust. The thoughts of our comrades and the work of our Party will also have dust, and should be cleaned and washed. 'Running water does not stagnate, and a door pivot does not rot,' means that they resist the erosion of microorganisms or other organisms in the continuous movement. For us, regularly reviewing our work, promoting a democratic style in the review, not fearing criticism and self-criticism, implementing 'know everything and say everything,' 'the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take warning,' 'correct if there is a mistake, and encourage if there is not,' these beneficial maxims of the Chinese people are the only effective methods to resist the erosion of political microorganisms such as errors and shortcomings in the thoughts of our comrades and the body of our Party. The rectification movement, which aims at 'learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones and treating diseases to save people,' has had a great effect because we have launched correct rather than distorted, serious rather than perfunctory criticism and self-criticism in this movement. The Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the broadest people of China as their starting point, believe that their cause is completely in line with justice, do not hesitate to sacrifice everything of themselves, and are always ready to take out their own lives to devote to our cause. Do we still have any wrong ideas, views, opinions, and methods that do not suit the needs of the people and are reluctant to discard them? Do we still welcome any political dust and political microorganisms to defile our clean face and erode our healthy body? Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making each of us living people feel sad when we think of them. Do we still have any personal interests or errors and shortcomings that cannot be sacrificed?" ("On Coalition Government")

Finally, in this movement, the work of Party internal theory education should be further strengthened, the Party's organizational life should be rectified, criticism and self-criticism should be launched, and a system of regular inspection work should be established.

　　反对贪污蜕化、反对官僚主义
　　——一九五一年八月三十一日在东北一级党员干部会议上的报告
　　高岗同志们：
    我今天所要讲的是关于反对贪污蜕化、反对官僚主义的问题。
    为什么要提出这个问题呢？
    大家知道：我们党经过了三十年光荣伟大、艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于领导中国人民战胜了国内外敌人，取得了中国革命的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国；我们党正在继续领导全国人民建设和巩固自己的国家。
    大家也知道：几年来东北地区党的组织在毛主席和党中央的领导之下，经济建设工作是有成绩的，各个岗位的工作也是有成绩的。
    这是中国人民的光荣，毛主席的光荣，党的光荣，无数艰苦朴素、全心全意为党为人民事业而奋斗的同志们的光荣！
    但是中国革命的胜利，并不等于中国革命事业的完成。恰恰相反，随着中国革命在全国范围的胜利，中国共产党和中国人民所肩负的责任是愈加重大了。
    正如毛主席所教导我们的：夺取全国胜利，这只是“像万里长征走完了第一步”。今后的任务是要“建设一个繁荣昌盛的国家”，就是说要“建立强大的国防军”与“建立强大的经济力量”。因为只有如此，才能将我们的国家进一步巩固起来，使其免于遭受帝国主义的侵略；才能将我国由落后的农业的国家，变为先进的工业的国家；也只有如此，才能将我国的社会制度稳步地引向社会主义——共产主义，这是我们共产党人所奋斗的目标。
    但是在全国革命胜利与东北转入以经济建设工作为中心之后，大批旧的机关、企业中的工作人员转到人民的机关与企业中工作，他们之中，有大部分经过教育改造而开始建立为人民服务的思想，但还有一些人改造得很差，甚至根本没有什么改造，继续着国民党反动派的贪污作风，同时各种奸商与反动阶级的残余分子，也都在采取各种引诱、欺骗的手段，企图软化我们队伍中那些意志不坚定的分子，而我们也确有一些党员，甚至个别的老干部，经不起这种诱惑而堕入泥坑，产生了严重的贪污蜕化倾向，腐蚀着革命的队伍，妨害了党和人民群众的联系，这是一个极为严重的问题，如不彻底解决，就会贻害人民，贻害革命。
    这些贪污分子中，严重者已深堕泥坑，完全丧失了共产党员的品质而蜕化为偷盗国家和人民财产的盗贼了。这些蜕化分子，为了掩盖其卑劣行为，争取“同情者”，正在制造各种藉口。如说：“由乡村转入城市，为适应新的环境要讲究一些”；“做统一战线工作必须应酬”；“机关家务是我搞生产弄来的，个人用一点不算什么”；而如果批评他们，他们又会说别人是“农村观点”，“注意生活小节”等等。他们害怕民主，他们就尽可能地利用这些“理由”来压制与打击群众对他们盗窃行为的批评与揭发，广大的党员与干部当然不会承认这种“理由”，但也确有少数幼稚的同志为他们这种“理由”所俘掳，而不能对之进行必要的斗争。
    某些党员干部沾染了严重的地主、买办、封建官僚与其他非工人阶级的庸俗化的观点和作风：他们对革命胜利的看法，不是像斯大林同志所说的：夺取政权“只是无产阶级革命的开始”，而认为是革命的“尽头”。因而骄傲麻痹，在政治上丧失警惕，敌我不分，极端无原则地任用私人，以致把反革命分子也拉进革命机关中来，并包庇这些人。如我们东北人民政府有一个部长，不经组织批准，先后录用了十六名亲戚朋友为干部，其中有叛党分子四名，反动党团及有严重政治嫌疑的分子三名，被斗的逃亡地主两名，原在他处工作因品质不好被洗刷者三名，而他对这些人的政治情形事先是完全知道的。又如还有一个在政府里担任副局长的干部，也私自介绍了六名亲友到他工作的局里工作，其中有四名已查明是有政治问题的：如他的弟弟是有重大血债的“清剿”队长，但他却委为该局供应科员，并拟提为科长。又如沈阳市人民政府的一个局长，把犯人改造队介绍来的一个原蒋匪炮兵营营长张汉杰分配为工程队长，张在工程队进行反革命活动被人民政府枪决，他尚表示留恋说：“张的工作真积极”；他同时还包庇与伪中统特务有密切关系、表现很坏的王某，硬说他“不是政治问题，是思想落后”。
    这种观点还表现在某些党员干部中所产生的忽视政治的倾向。他们不愿过党的生活，不重视理论学习，说：“开党的会议是闲事，那有时间搞这些闲玩艺？”甚至拒绝做党的工作，被分配担任党的支部工作时认为是“欺负老实人”，藉口学习技术，忽视或反对理论学习，说“不学习政治可以工作，不学技术不能吃饭。”正是因为他们是如此地讨厌政治和憎恶党的组织生活，因而他们的许多错误思想也就无以纠正而愈加发展了。
    同志们！你们看这些人的共产主义的原则性到那里去了？请问！作为一个共产党员，这是可以允许的吗？
    这些问题严重不严重呢？毫无疑问是很严重的。
    它的性质如何呢？它是把地主、官僚、买办和其他非工人阶级的意识形态、生活方式、工作作风带到我们党内来了。这些东西是同马列主义根本冲突的，是同共产党员的称号相冲突的，是同工人阶级的意识形态、生活作风相冲突的。它是腐蚀党的毒素，是党与人民的敌人所喜欢的东西，如果不能及时给以克服，而任其发展，将会腐蚀党的战斗力，并使党的事业无法前进一步。因之必须组织全党同这种思想进行坚决的斗争，并彻底克服它。
    为什么这种严重现象能够在我们革命队伍中存在呢？这里除了一些不纯分子混入了党的组织，同时在人民政府的各部门中留用了不少思想上未经彻底改造的人员而外，还由于极少数的较老的党员思想情绪发生了变化（如居功自傲和享受思想的发展），特别应指出的是各级领导机关中官僚主义，组织不严密，马列主义教育进行的不够，批评与自我批评没有很好的展开，检查工作很差，因而对上述思想倾向采取了自由主义的态度，甚至对于那些贪污蜕化分子，采取“慢慢地教育他们，不要着急”的姑息态度，这就给了那些贪污蜕化分子以可乘之机。
    这里我准备说一说东北一级某些机关中官僚主义的情形。
    我们有这样一些机关，有这样一些领导同志，他们沾染了浓厚的官僚主义的习气，他们注意形式的装璜，例如沈阳街道上的美国、英国汽车增多起来了，送礼、请客的情形也多起来了，似乎不乘英美制的汽车就不能工作，不送礼就不足以表现革命的友爱，而开会如不请客，就不足以表现会议的成就一样。
    至于说到工作的情形，那么，我们某些单位就不如对于汽车、请客那样“积极”。
    我们的东北人民政府的一个机关，一件渔民组织工会的法令，在机关中旅行了四个月还没有公布。
    我们一个部队的参谋长，经他自己签署发下去的一个命令，既不加检查，而且连这个命令都忘了。
    有一个卫生机关，那里的若干箱医疗器具都生了锈还不知道，药品坏了也不知道。
    我们一个飞机场的场长报告说：“据报机场被水淹”，其实机场根本没有淹，因为他是“据报”的。同志们想想，做场长的住在飞机场里还要“据报”呢，请看，我们的官僚主义到了何种程度！
    至于机关随便添人，随便添家具，随便接家眷，随便雇保姆的情形那就更多了。某些单位，对公物之不爱惜更达到惊人的地步。而在某些机关工作中的形式主义、敷衍塞责、等因奉此、例行公事、滥发文件表格、不检查、不解决问题，以致把革命的为人民服务的机关，变成了没有生气、没有创造、谈空话、滥发号令的官僚机关的事实，也不胜枚举。
    这些官僚主义者，对盗窃国家财富，侵吞公产的事实，简直是熟视无睹，他们从不对这些罪恶行为加以起码的检查和追究，他们正像斯大林同志所说的那样：
    “他们好像瞎子一样，看不见这些事实，以为‘这里并没有什么特别了不得的事’。但这些同志们是大错而特错了的。也如资本主义底基础是私有制一样，我们苏维埃制度底基础就是公有制。如果说资本家当时用宣布私有财产
    神圣不可侵犯的办法，而达到了巩固资本主义制度的目的，那么我们共产党人就更加应当宣布公有财产神圣不可侵犯，来巩固一切生产部门与商业部门方面的社会主义新经济形式。容许偷窃公有财产，容许侵吞公有财产，不管是国家财产也好，或合作社和集体农庄财产也好，而不理会这种反革命的胡行，便是帮助敌人来破坏我们这个以公有制为基础的苏维埃制度。”（列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设下册五七六页）
    同志们！在我们国家也是一样，容许盗窃国家财产，容许贪污浪费的胡行，就是容许破坏我们国家的物质基础，就是容许破坏我们与人民群众的联系，这种行为，这种作风，难道是可以容许它继续存在吗？
    同志们，肃清我们各级领导机关中的官僚主义作风的必要，难道不是很显然的吗？
    为了肃清贪污蜕化倾向，反对官僚主义，应该进行下列措施：
   （一）要在所有机关中，无例外地开展一个群众性的民主运动，来揭发本机关内部的以及有关部门和一切人员中的贪污蜕化的思想行为与官僚主义的作风。这个运动，应该由各机关负责同志亲自领导，有准备地进行。即先搜集材料做报告，号召犯有这种错误的人自动坦白改过、号召群众揭发、检举，务使全体人员彻底认识贪污蜕化是革命队伍中最丑恶最可耻的行为，并认识这种思想与行为对于党和国家的危害性，使大家了解“大敌当前，有打倒之必要”，从而使任何一个贪污蜕化分子在革命队伍中无藏身之所，形成“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的空气。这样，才能将这个斗争进行彻底。各个机关的负责同志（特别是财经机关），要以最坚决的态度，把这个运动进行到底，不许中断。只有这样，才能使我们的干部健康，事业前进。
    要使这个运动开展得好，必须做好教育工作；必须把这个运动与整党教育联系进行。要在党员群众中结合这个运动中所揭发的事实，具体说明如何做一个共产党员，共产党员党性应当如何；说明贪污蜕化分子所喜欢的东西，正是我们所反对的东西，他们所憎恶、所害怕的东西，正是我们需要加强的东西。用登报、广播、演戏、漫画、好坏对比的方式说明每个党员、每个革命工作人员应当如何同盗窃行为作斗争，如何同官僚主义作斗争。这些工作做好了，就可以有力地推动这个运动，大大地提高党员和群众的政治觉悟，提高他们爱护公共资财的责任心，就可以改进我们机关的工作作风，使我们机关的政治面貌为之一新。这个工作是长期的，应该反复地去做。
    正如斯大林同志所说：
    “我们必须与盗窃行为，与我们国家机关、合作社、职工会中的所谓‘快乐的’盗窃行为进行有系统的斗争。如报纸上所说的，有可耻的隐蔽的盗窃行为；有勇敢的‘快乐的’盗窃行为。不久以前，我在‘共青团真理报’上读了奥古涅夫论‘快乐的’盗窃行为的文章。似乎有这样一个潇洒人物——有着小胡须的青年人，他在我们的一个机关里快乐地偷东西，他有系统地经常地偷东西，并且偷得很成功。在这里更值得注意的，不是贼本人，而是这种事实，即周围的群众，明明知道贼，不仅不和他斗争，相反的，拍拍他的肩头，称赞他的巧妙，因之，贼在人们眼里成了一种英雄。同志们，这是值得注意的，这也是最危险的。当捉住了一个敌探或叛徒的时候，群众的愤怒是没有界限的，都要求枪毙。而当贼在大家眼中活动，盗窃国家财物的时候，周围的群众却限于慈祥的微笑和拍肩称赞。很明白的，盗窃人民财物，损害国民经济利益的贼，也是敌探及叛徒，要是不更坏的话。最后终于逮捕了这个有着小胡须的潇洒的小鸽子。但逮捕一个‘快乐的’贼是有什么意义呢？我们有成千成万的这样的贼，你依靠国家保安部是不能把他们全部除尽的。这里需要另外的、更有效更严肃的办法。这种办法，就是在这些贼周围造成一般道德抵制及周围群众憎恨的气氛。这种办法，就是在工人和农民中间掀起一个运动，造成一种精神的气氛，这种气氛排斥偷盗的可能性，使偷窃人民的财物的盗贼，不论‘快乐的’或‘不快乐的’，都不能生活与存在。消灭盗窃，乃是防护我们的积累，避免耗费的手段之一，——任务就是如此。”（斯大林：论苏联经济形式与党底政策：列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设下册六十九至七十页）
    同时，为了吸引广大的党与非党群众参加这个运动，并发挥他们的积极性，必须充分发扬民主，要把这个运动成为一个民主的检查工作、检查思想、检查作风的运动。应该宣布所有党与非党群众均有向一切机关、一切负责同志控告任何党员与干部的权利，对于一切党员和群众的这种权利，不准有任何压制行为，否则应受处分。
    因为不如此，是无法发挥群众的积极性的。毛主席说：
    “所谓发挥积极性，不能只是一句空话，必须具体表现在领导机关、干部与党员的创造能力，负责精神，工作的活跃，敢于与善于提出问题，发表意见，批评缺点，以及对于领导机关与领导干部从爱护观点出发的监督作用，等等上面。没有这些，所谓积极性就是空的。而这些积极性的发挥，有赖于党内生活制度的民主化，没有或缺乏民主生活，是不能达到发挥积极性之目的的。”（“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”）
    此外，为使这个运动进行得正确并收到最大的效果，在进行中还必须教育一切党与非党的群众实事求是，方式要恰当，防止夸大与诬陷，并警惕破坏分子乘机活动。
    （二）对运动中所揭发与检举出的证据确凿的贪污蜕化分子，必须以极端严肃的态度加以处理，任何迁就与原谅的态度都是错误的，都是对革命的罪恶。因为如果不这样，就等于放纵坏人，鼓励人们做坏事。
    对待这种不可救药的贪污蜕化分子，必须学习列宁的严正态度，列宁说：
    “在历史上任何一次大革命中，民众没有不本能地感觉到这一点，没有不表现其除恶决心而把盗贼就地枪决的。从前各次革命中的不幸，就在于使群众保持紧张心情而能无情镇压腐化分子的那种革命热忱，未曾长久支持下去，当时群众革命热忱之所以这样不稳固，其社会原因，即阶级原因，就是无产阶级本身上薄弱，而只有无产阶级（如果它已经有充分的数量，充分的觉悟和充分的纪律），才是唯一能够将大多数被剥削劳动者（如果更简单更通俗些说，就是大多数穷人）吸收到自己方面来，能够充分长期地执掌政权，来完全压服一切剥削者和一切腐化分子。”（列宁斯大林“论社会主义经济建设”一三二页）
    在那些犯了贪污腐化错误的人的面前，摆着两条道路：一条是悔过自新，重新为人民工作；一条是继续坏下去，为党和人民所唾弃。何去何从，须要他们自己选择。但是，既要做坏事，又想装模作样，不失掉“党票”，既要贪污腐化，又想逍遥自在不受法律的惩罚，这是不可能的，利用党员的地位、国家机关的职权去做坏事是党和人民所绝不能允许的。因之，对那些情节严重，不可救药的分子，必须按照国家的法律给以严格的制裁，并开除党籍。其余应按情节轻重与本人改悔的程度，根据党纪、法纪分别处理。凡自动坦白者，重者减罪、轻者免罪；一贯贪污腐化或贪污数目甚大经检举而仍不坦白悔过者，从严惩处。对赃物的处理，原则上必须追还，其已浪费一部不能全部追还者，按具体情况分别处理。今后凡是需要送司法机关处理的贪污案件均要送司法机关处理，不能仅由本机关批评一顿，马虎了事。
    今后党的纪律检查委员会与政府的监察委员会要有计划、有组织地检查这一方面的问题，在最近时期内要集中力量来与贪污蜕化及官僚主义的倾向作斗争。
    （三）在处理贪污蜕化分子时，还应同时表扬和奖励那些具有高度事业心和创造性、廉洁奉公、无论在工业、农业以及其他方面，坚决保卫国家人民利益，积极为国家、人民创造财富的战斗英雄、先进工人、模范农民、模范技术人员、模范青年、模范妇女、模范革命工作人员、模范的党与非党干部。对于这些人，我们要积极鼓励他们前进，敢于提拔他们到适当的岗位上来。对于这些先进模范人物的提拔，应该像撤职并惩罚那些贪污蜕化分子一样的坚决，借以伸张正气，肃清歪风。这里我们必须记住毛主席的话，他说：
    “共产党员在政府工作中，应该是十分廉洁，不用私人，多做工作，少取报酬的模范。共产党员在民众运动中，应该是民众的朋友，而不是民众的上司，是诲人不倦的教师，而不是官僚主义的政客。共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，个人利益服从于民族的与群众的利益。因此，自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的。而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干等等精神，才是值得尊敬的模范。”（“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”）
    （四）在这个运动中，应该无例外地对于各个机关的工作与领导作风来一次严肃的检查，必须向各式各样的官僚主义开火，因为它是贪污腐化这种毒菌之所以能够滋长的温床。要肃清贪污蜕化的倾向，必须同时肃清官僚主义。有些机关中那种应付差事，只说空话、不切实际、饱食终日、无所用心的现象，必须让它寿终正寝，而代之以生动活泼的、实事求是的工作精神和工作作风。
    因之，对于各个机关的工作，都要以批评和自我批评的精神，加以检查，加以裁判。要检查工作的实际结果，要检查各种制度的规定是否妥当、贯彻的情形如何，从而并修改、充实与建立各种必须建立的制度。
    今后制度一经制定，就要坚决执行，任何人都不能违反。比如：与商人来往、机关生产、生活待遇、用人行政、使用汽车、接家属、用保姆等，都要有一定的制度，不能各行其是（今后经过批准接来的家属，除老弱外，均要参加劳动，实行不劳动不得食的原则）。
    规定了制度，还要实行各级负责制，不得相互推脱责任。
    关于反对官僚主义的问题，斯大林同志说：“官僚主义的危险，首先，就是官僚主义埋没了隐藏在我们系统中的无数可能，不利用他们，企图把群众的创造性化为乌有，关在事务房里，使党的每种新的发端都变成细小无聊的贪欲。第二，官僚主义的危险，就是官僚主义经不起关于执行情形的审查，它企图把领导机关的主要指示变成纸上的、和实际生活完全脱离关系的空话。不仅那些钻在我们机关中的旧官僚是有危险的，而新的官僚分子、苏维埃的官僚分子也是危险的，并且比旧官僚更危险。至于在苏维埃官僚中间，‘共产党员’的官僚分子还起很大的作用。我说的是有些‘共产党员’，他们用办公处的命令、‘吩咐’（他们相信这些东西的力量，好像相信偶像一样）的方法，去代替几千万工农群众的创造性和自动性。
    这里的任务，就是打倒我们机关中和组织中的官僚主义，消灭官僚主义的‘道德’和‘习惯’，肃清道路，好去利用我们系统中的可能，发展群众的创造性和独立性。………
    在反对官僚主义的斗争中，党的工作向四方面进行：发展自我批评，审查各种工作执行的程度，清洗机关，从工人阶级中自下提拔忠实的工作人员到机关中去。”（列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设下册四七三至四七四页）
    关于检查工作与批评的重要性，正如斯大林同志所说的：
    “据说，对于胜利者是不应裁判，不应批评，不应检查的。这话不对。对于胜利者可以而且必须加以裁判，可以而且必须加以批评和检查。这不仅对于事业有益处，而且对于胜利者本身也有益处：那他们就会少骄傲一点，而多谦逊一些。……若是我国共产党害怕批评和检查，那它就会没有多大价值了。……”（“斯大林同志于一九四六年二月九日在莫斯科城斯大林选区选民大会上的演说”）
    也正如毛主席在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会报告中所说：
    “有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著标志之一。我们曾经说过，房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘。脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。我们同志的思想，我们党的工作，也会发生灰尘的，也应该打扫与洗涤。‘流水不腐，户枢不蠹’，是说它们在不停的运动中抵抗了微生物或其他生物的侵蚀。对于我们，经常地检讨工作，在检讨中推广民主作风，不惧怕批评与自我批评，实行‘知无不言，言无不尽’，‘言者无罪，闻者足戒’，‘有则改之，无则加勉’，这些中国人民的有益的格言，正是抵抗错误、缺点这类政治微生物侵蚀我们同志的思想与我们党的肌体的唯一有效的方法。以‘惩前毖后、治病救人’为宗旨的整风运动之所以发生了很大的效力，就是因为我们在这个运动中展开了正确的而不是歪曲的、认真的而不是敷衍的批评与自我批评。以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道我们还有什么错误的不适合人民需要的思想，观点，意见，办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘，政治的微生物来点污我们的清洁的面貌与侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益或错误、缺点，不能牺牲吗？”（“论联合政府”）
    最后，要在这个运动中进一步加强党内理论教育的工作，整顿党的组织生活，开展批评与自我批评，建立经常检查工作的制度。
