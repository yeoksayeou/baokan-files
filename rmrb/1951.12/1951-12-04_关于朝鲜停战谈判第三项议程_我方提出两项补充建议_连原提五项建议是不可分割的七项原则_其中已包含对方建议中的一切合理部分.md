Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 3rd: At the plenary session of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation on the morning of December 3rd, our side's representatives continued to refute the unreasonable suggestions and absurd demands put forward by the other side regarding the third item on the agenda. Our representatives sternly pointed out that the Korean people absolutely cannot tolerate anyone interfering with their sacred and inviolable right to handle their own defense equipment. The Korean people also absolutely cannot allow the other side to freely enter all parts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for reconnaissance. These two absurd suggestions of the other side, attempting to openly undermine the sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, are by no means something a military armistice agreement should involve, nor are they something our side can tolerate. Furthermore, the other side's absurd propositions to maintain the rotation of US troops and the replenishment of weapons and ammunition during the armistice, and to retain the other side's armed forces on our rear islands, can only make one suspect whether the other side's suggestion that both sides should not transport armed forces and military equipment from outside Korea is truly intended to ensure the stability of the military armistice.

On the afternoon of December 3rd, the Korean-Chinese delegation, based on the arguments made by both sides regarding the third item on the agenda during the seven days of the delegation's plenary session, put forward two supplementary suggestions to our side's original five principles. Our representatives pointed out that our seven principles are a whole, and each article is interconnected and indivisible. Our seven principles also include all reasonable parts of the other side's suggestions. Whether the third item on the agenda can be quickly agreed upon will entirely depend on the other side's attitude towards these seven principles.

The full text of our seven principles is as follows:

　　(1) All armed forces of both sides, including regular and irregular troops and armed personnel of the land, sea, and air forces, shall cease all hostile acts from the date of signing the armistice agreement.

　　(2) All armed forces of both sides shall withdraw from the demilitarized area within three days after the signing of the armistice agreement.

　　(3) All armed forces of both sides shall, within five days after the signing of the armistice agreement, withdraw from the other side's rear areas and coastal islands and sea areas, with the military demarcation line as the boundary. If they fail to withdraw after the deadline and there is no reason for delaying the withdrawal, the other side has the right to take all necessary actions to maintain public order with respect to such armed personnel.

　　(4) No armed forces of either side shall enter the demilitarized zone, nor shall they conduct any armed actions in the area.

　　(5) Each side shall designate an equal number of commissioners to form an armistice commission, which shall be jointly responsible for the specific arrangements and supervision of the implementation of the entire armistice agreement, except for the scope of monitoring stipulated in Article 6 of this item.

　　(6) In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice and to facilitate the conduct of higher-level political conferences between the two sides, both sides shall guarantee that no military forces, weapons, or ammunition will enter Korea from outside Korea under any pretext.

　　(7) In order to supervise the strict implementation of the provisions of Article 6, both sides agree to invite representatives of neutral countries in the Korean War to form a monitoring agency responsible for conducting necessary inspections at the rear ports agreed upon by both sides outside the demilitarized zone and submitting reports on the results of the inspections to the armistice commission of both sides.

    关于朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程
    我方提出两项补充建议
    连原提五项建议是不可分割的七项原则
    其中已包含对方建议中的一切合理部分
    【新华社开城三日电】十二月三日上午的朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方对于第三项议程所提出的无理建议与荒谬要求。我方代表严词指出：朝鲜人民绝对不能容许任何人过问他们处理他们自己的防御设备的神圣不可侵犯的权利。朝鲜人民也绝对不能容许对方自由出入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一切部分进行侦察。对方的这两项荒谬建议，企图公然破坏朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的主权，绝非一个军事停战协定所应涉及，亦绝非我方所能容忍。而对方所提出在停战期间维持美军的轮换和武器弹药的补充，并在我方后方岛屿保留对方武装部队的荒谬主张，更只能令人怀疑对方所提出的双方不应自朝鲜境外运入武装部队与军事装备的建议，是否确是为了保证军事停战的稳定。十二月三日下午朝中代表团根据了代表团大会七天以来双方对于第三项议程的论点，对于我方原有的五项原则建议提出了两项补充建议。我方代表指出：我方的七项原则建议是一个整体，各条之间相互关联不可分割。我方的七项原则建议也包含了对方建议中的一切合理部分。第三项议程是否能够迅速达成协议，将完全决定于对方对于这七项原则建议的态度。
    我方的七项原则建议全文如下：
    （一）双方一切武装力量，包括陆、海、空军的正规与非正规部队与武装人员，应自停战协议签字之日起，停止一切敌对行为。
    （二）双方一切武装力量应于停战协议签字后三天内，自非军事地区撤出。
    （三）双方一切武装力量应于停战协议签字后五天内，以军事分界线为界，自对方的后方和沿海岛屿及海面撤走，如逾期不撤，又无任何延期撤走的理由，则对方为维持治安，对于此类武装人员有权采取一切必要的行动。
    （四）双方一切武装力量，均不得进入非军事地区，亦不得对该地区进行任何武装行动。
    （五）双方各指定同等数目的委员，组成停战委员会，共同负责具体安排和监督除本项第六条所规定的监察范围外的全部停战协议的实施。
    （六）为保证军事停战的稳定，以利双方高一级的政治会议的进行，双方应保证不从朝鲜境外以任何藉口进入任何军事力量、武器和弹药。
    （七）为监督第六条规定的严格实施，双方同意邀请在朝鲜战争中的中立国家的代表，成立监察机构，负责到非军事区以外的双方同意的后方口岸，进行必要的视察，并向双方停战委员会提出关于视察结果的报告。
