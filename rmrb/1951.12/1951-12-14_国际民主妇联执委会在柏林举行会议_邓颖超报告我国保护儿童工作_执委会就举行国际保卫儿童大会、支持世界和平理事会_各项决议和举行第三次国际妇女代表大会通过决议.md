Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 13th: Deng Yingchao, the representative of China attending the Executive Committee meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Berlin, reported on the preparations of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation for the International Children's Defense Conference at the meeting on the 9th. She said: Since the founding of the People's Republic of China two years ago, China's child welfare work has made great progress under the slogan of "Defend Peace! Defend Children!" At present, there are more than 15,700 nurseries, kindergartens and other child welfare institutions run by the state and private individuals, accommodating more than 520,000 children, which is nine times that of the pre-liberation era. China has now established the "China National Committee for the Protection of Children" to ensure that the people of the whole country take responsibility for eliminating the war crisis, protecting children's lives and improving children's environment. Protecting children's happiness and fighting for children's rights are inseparable from lasting world peace. It is very necessary for the Women's International Democratic Federation to convene the International Children's Defense Conference. Deng Yingchao concluded by saying: We believe that all people in the world who do not want war, all parents who desire peace, and all people who care about children's happiness, can unite more and more widely through the children's defense movement, and jointly fight against the war conspiracy of the imperialist elements and strive for world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 13th: The Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation held a meeting in Berlin from the 7th to the 10th. More than 70 representatives from more than 20 countries including the Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom attended the meeting. The meeting heard the report of Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, on the "Resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council and the Tasks of the Women's International Democratic Federation in the Struggle for Peace," and the report of Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, on the "Preparatory Work for the Third International Women's Congress," and passed resolutions on these two reports. The meeting also heard reports from women's organizations from various countries on the work of preparing for the International Children's Defense Conference to be held in Vienna in April next year.

Mrs. Gordon's report pointed out: The resolutions of the World Peace Council reflect the vital interests of women all over the world. This is a program for further developing the peace movement and absorbing the broad masses of women into this movement. The Women's International Democratic Federation has always actively struggled for peace, the protection of children and the vital interests of women, and has therefore won the respect and trust of the broadest sections of women all over the world. The increasing number of members of the Women's International Democratic Federation proves this. Amidst thunderous applause, Mrs. Gordon announced that the Women's International Democratic Federation now has increased to 130 million members, including 67 countries.

In her report, Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier described the activities carried out by democratic women's organizations in various countries in the half year since the Sofia meeting of the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation. She said: Women in various countries are launching a broad movement demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. Women's organizations in various countries have widely publicized the report of the investigation team of the Women's International Democratic Federation on the atrocities of the US-Li army in Korea to the people of various countries, and the scope of this movement exposing the atrocities of the US army is still expanding. Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier also said that the women's organizations of the Women's International Democratic Federation are widely preparing for the International Children's Defense Conference.

During the discussion of the reports by Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Chinese representative Deng Yingchao spoke first, saying: The resolutions and open letter to the United Nations and the people of the world passed by the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council are the best basis for carrying out political mobilization for the Third World Women's Congress. All countries should combine them with their current political tasks according to their different situations, and put forward general slogans and specific slogans. In China, the first thing to do is to call on Chinese women and all the people to resolutely realize their tasks in 1952. That is to continue to strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, implement increased production and thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and carry out this struggle until the Korean issue is resolved fairly and reasonably. In Korea, Vietnam and other countries, the main task at present is how to defeat the invaders and liberate their people. The struggle of women for peace and their own liberation should be linked to this main task. Deng Yingchao then said: The Third World Women's Congress must be a worldwide congress that unites the broad masses of women. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation will do everything possible to mobilize and unite the broad masses of women to support and assist the preparatory work of the congress.

Soviet representative Popova stated that Soviet women wholeheartedly support the resolutions of the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council and the proposal to convene the Third International Women's Congress. She described in detail the great contributions of Soviet women to the cause of peace and to strengthening the strength of the Soviet peace fortress. She then explained the tasks of the Women's International Democratic Federation in implementing the resolutions of the World Peace Council, preparing for the International Children's Defense Conference, and preparing for the convening of the Third International Women's Congress.

The British representative spoke about how Mrs. Felton had reported on the atrocities of the US and Li armies in Korea at more than 200 gatherings. Italian representative Tregi said that aid Korea committees had been established in Italy even in remote rural areas. Representatives from the United States, West Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway all reported on the new achievements made by women's organizations in various countries in the struggle to defend peace. Representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary reported on the achievements of women in the people's democratic countries in peaceful construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 13th: The German Democratic Women's Federation held a mass rally in Berlin on the 10th to celebrate the successful conclusion of the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation. About 2,000 people attended the rally, including President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Grotewohl, members of the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and representatives of German women's organizations. Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, delivered a speech at the meeting, announcing the resolutions passed by this Executive Committee, namely: 1. To hold the International Children's Defense Conference in Vienna in April 1952; 2. To vigorously support the resolutions of the World Peace Council; 3. To convene the Third International Women's Congress in Denmark in 1952. Soviet representative Popova, Spanish representative Ibárruri, and Chinese representative Deng Yingchao also spoke at the meeting. In her speech, Deng Yingchao paid tribute to German women and the German people on behalf of all Chinese women.

    【新华社柏林十三日电】我国出席国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会柏林会议代表邓颖超，在九日会议上报告了中华全国民主妇女联合会筹备国际保卫儿童大会各种工作的情况，她说：中华人民共和国成立两年以来，中国的儿童福利工作在“保卫和平！保卫儿童！”的口号下已经获得飞跃进展。目前全国由国家和私人举办的托儿所、幼稚园和其他儿童福利机构有一万五千七百多处，容纳儿童五十二万余人，为解放前的九倍。中国现在已成立了“中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会”，以使全国人民都负起责任来消除战争危机、保护儿童生命和改善儿童的环境。保卫儿童幸福和为儿童的权利而斗争，是和世界持久和平分不开的。由国际民主妇联召开国际保卫儿童大会是非常必要的。邓颖超最后说：我们相信全世界一切不愿意战争的人们、一切愿望和平的父母、一切关心儿童幸福的人们，能够通过保卫儿童运动越来越广泛地团结起来，共同为反对帝国主义分子战争阴谋和争取世界和平而斗争。
    【新华社柏林十三日电】国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会在七日到十日在柏林举行会议。出席会议的有苏联、中国、法国、意大利、英国等二十多个国家的代表七十多人。会议听取了国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人的“关于世界和平理事会第二次会议各项决议和国际民主妇联在争取和平斗争中的任务”的报告，和国际民主妇联总书记瓦扬—古久里夫人的“关于第三次国际妇女代表大会筹备工作”的报告，并就这两个报告通过了决议。会议又听取了各国妇女团体关于筹备明年四月在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会的工作报告。
    戈登夫人的报告指出：世界和平理事会的决议反映了全世界妇女的切身利益，这是进一步发展和平运动并把广大的妇女群众吸收到这个运动中来的纲领。国际民主妇联一贯积极为争取和平、保护儿童和妇女们的切身利益而斗争，因此赢得了全世界最广大阶层妇女的尊敬和信任，国际民主妇联会员的日益增多便证明了这一点。戈登夫人在雷动的掌声中宣布：国际民主妇联的会员现在已增加到一亿三千万人，包括了六十七个国家。
    瓦扬—古久里夫人在报告中讲述了各国民主妇女组织在国际民主妇联执行委员会索非亚会议以后半年来所进行的活动。她说：各国妇女正在展开要求禁止原子武器的广大运动，各国妇女团体已把国际民主妇联调查团调查美李军在朝鲜的暴行的报告广泛向各国人民宣传，这个揭露美军兽行的运动，范围还在不断扩大。瓦扬—古久里夫人又说：国际民主妇联所属各国妇女团体正在广泛地筹备国际保卫儿童大会。
    在讨论戈登夫人和瓦扬—古久里夫人的报告时，中国代表邓颖超首先发言说：世界和平理事会维也纳会议通过的各项决议和告联合国与全世界人民书，是为举行第三次世界妇女代表大会而进行政治动员的最好基础，各国应根据各自不同的情况，结合它们当前的政治任务，提出总的口号和具体的口号来。在中国，首先应该号召中国妇女和全体人民在一道坚决实现他们一九五二年的任务，这就是继续加强抗美援朝运动，实行增产节约支援中国人民志愿军，并把这个斗争进行到朝鲜问题得到公平合理地解决时为止。在朝鲜、越南和其他国家，目前的主要任务就是如何打倒侵略者，解放他们的人民，妇女争取和平和她们自己的解放的斗争应该和这个主要任务联系在一起。邓颖超接着说：第三次世界妇女代表大会必须是一个联合广大妇女群众的全世界规模的大会。中国民主妇女联合会将尽一切力量动员并团结广大的妇女群众来支持和协助大会的筹备工作。
    苏联代表波波娃表示苏联妇女全心全意支持世界和平理事会维也纳会议的决议和召开第三次国际妇女大会的建议。她详尽地叙述了苏联妇女对和平事业、对加强和平堡垒苏联的力量而作的伟大贡献。她接着说明了国际民主妇联在实现世界和平理事会决议、筹备国际保卫儿童大会、以及筹备召开第三次国际妇女大会时的任务。
    英国代表发言时讲到费尔顿夫人已在二百多个集会上报告了美、李军在朝鲜的暴行。意大利代表特列吉说：意大利甚至在穷乡僻壤都已成立了援助朝鲜委员会。美国、西德、法国、丹麦、瑞典、挪威的代表都报告了各国妇女组织在保卫和平的斗争中所取得的新的成就。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和匈牙利的代表报告了人民民主国家妇女在和平建设中的成就。
    【新华社柏林十三日电】德国民主妇女联合会十日在柏林召开群众大会，庆祝国际民主妇联执行委员会会议胜利闭幕。参加大会的约有两千人，其中有德意志民主共和国总统皮克、总理格罗提渥、国际民主妇联执行委员会委员和德国妇女团体的代表。国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人在会上发表演说，宣布了这次执行委员会通过的决议，即：一、一九五二年四月在维也纳举行国际保卫儿童大会；二、大力支持世界和平理事会的决议；三、一九五二年在丹麦召开第三次国际妇女代表大会。在大会上发言的还有苏联代表波波娃、西班牙代表伊巴露丽、中国代表邓颖超。邓颖超在发言中代表全中国妇女
