    Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: According to a Telecommunications Agency report from New York on December 22nd: "The National Guardian Weekly," a publication of the American Progressive Party, reported that the parents of Paul Shinner, an American prisoner of war in Korea, have made a public appeal for an immediate peace in Korea, which has been widely responded to by the American people. They are now calling for "the organization of committees of parents of American soldiers in Korea throughout the country" to wage a struggle for peace. Paul Shinner's parents recently refused to accept the Bronze Star medal from the U.S. government on behalf of their son, saying, "We just want our son to come home, we don't want the medal." The couple published an open letter to Truman in the December 1st issue of the "San Francisco Chronicle," demanding that he immediately issue a "final, formal ceasefire order" and immediately withdraw all American troops back to the United States. The letter called on "all peace groups, churches, Quakers, unions, and all organizations that want to end the Korean War and end the threat of other wars anywhere" to take united action for peace. The Shinner couple's letter has been responded to by many relatives of American soldiers in Korea. Their mailbox is filled with letters from families of American soldiers who invaded Korea, and their phone is constantly ringing. The Shinner couple told "The National Guardian Weekly," "The response from all sides has been very enthusiastic, and we also have great hopes. Therefore, we are planning to hold a mass meeting in the Civic Auditorium, which can accommodate 10,000 people. We believe that this small example of ours in San Francisco can trigger the organization of committees of parents of American soldiers in Korea throughout the country."
   Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: According to a Telecommunications Agency report from London on December 21st: British soldiers from the Gross contingent, recently returned from Korea, condemned the United States for obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations and openly said that they hoped the Korean War would end. Jackman, a soldier from Camberwell, London, told a reporter from the "Workers' Daily," "Many brothers believe that the Americans have been obstructing peace talks. Whenever there is hope for ending the war, the Americans come up with new demands." Mansell, a soldier from Plymouth, agreed with him. Mansell said, "It is the Americans who are hindering the negotiations." Sergeant Hall from Faringdon, Berkshire, told a reporter from the "Daily Sketch," "I never want to go to Korea again." Hobbs, a soldier from Buckinghamshire, also expressed the same opinion to a reporter from the "Daily Mail." The parents and relatives of British prisoners of war in Korea are demanding an end to the Korean War and the immediate return of the prisoners. Mrs. Richards from Hammersmith, London, told a reporter from the "Workers' Daily," "I think the prisoners should be sent home. The two sides should indeed exchange all prisoners. That's what my daughter thinks too. This is a meaningless war, we have no hatred towards China. This is an American war, and we get nothing out of it." Mrs. Richards' son-in-law was captured in Korea. Mrs. Walsh from Lambeth, London, also has a brother who is a prisoner. Mrs. Walsh said, "I hope the war ends. I don't understand at all why our young people are sent there." Mr. Ellicott from Alford, Surrey, has a son who is a prisoner. He demanded that the Americans quickly agree to an exchange of prisoners. Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: According to a Telecommunications Agency report from London on December 20th: The British Peace Committee warned on the 19th that the crisis of prolonging the Korean War is more serious than ever. The committee called on the British people to "designate next Sunday, December 23rd, as Korea Sunday." The Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee issued a statement saying, "Let each of us participate in the activities of that day in our own way to strive for reconciliation and achieve peace. Let us think of those who have lost loved ones in Korea, those British, American, and Korean prisoners of war who are anxiously waiting to return home to reunite; let us express our sympathy for them with our efforts." The committee called on peace-loving people with various different views to write to their members of Parliament, to the British Prime Minister, and to U.S. President Truman, demanding peace in Korea. Finally, the committee appealed to all peace-loving people in Britain, calling on them to collect millions of signatures for the declaration of a peace pact among the five major powers.

    美军俘虏家属呼吁组织起来争取和平
    英和委会号召人民争取实现朝鲜停战
    【新华社二十五日讯】据电通社纽约二十二日讯：美国进步党机关刊“国民前卫周刊”报道：在朝鲜的美国战俘保尔·许纳的父母提出了立刻在朝鲜实现和平的公开呼吁，这个呼吁已经得到美国人民的广泛响应。他们现在要求“在全国各地组织在朝美军父母的委员会”，进行争取和平的斗争。保尔·许纳的父母最近拒绝代表他们的儿子接受美国政府的铜星奖章，他们说：“我们只要我们的儿子回家，我们不要奖章。”这对夫妇在十二月一日的“旧金山纪事报”上发表了一封给杜鲁门的公开信，要求他立即发出“最后的、正式的停火命令”，并且把全部美国兵都立即撤回美国来。这封信呼吁“一切和平团体、教会、公谊会、工会以及希望结束朝鲜战争和结束任何地方其他战争威胁的一切组织”，以联合行动争取和平。许纳夫妇的这封信已经得到许多美国士兵的亲人的响应。他们的信箱里投满了侵朝美军家属的来信，他们的电话也不停地响。许纳夫妇告诉“国民前卫周刊”说：“各方的响应非常热烈，我们也抱着很大的希望，因此，我们正打算在可以容纳一万人的市民会堂举行一次群众大会。我们相信我们在旧金山的这个小小的榜样，可以在全国各地引起组织在朝美军父母的委员会。”
   【新华社二十二日讯】据电通社伦敦二十一日讯：刚从朝鲜返国的格罗斯?团的英国兵士，谴责美国阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，并公开地说，他们希望朝鲜战争结束。伦敦坎伯威尔的兵士杰克曼对“工人日报”一位记者说：“许多弟兄们认为，美国人一直阻挠和平谈判。每当有结束战争的希望时，美国人就提出一些新的要求。”普利穆斯的兵士曼塞尔赞成他的话。曼塞尔说：“阻挠谈判进行的是美国人。”培克郡费林顿的霍尔中士对“每日写真报”一位记者说：“我决不愿再到朝鲜去。”布金罕姆郡的兵士霍布斯也对“每日邮报”的一位记者表示了同样的意见。在朝鲜的英国战俘的父母和亲戚正在要求结束朝鲜战争，并使俘虏们立即返国。伦敦汉麦斯密斯的理查斯太太对“工人日报”一位记者说：“我认为，应该使俘虏们回国来。双方的确应该交换全部俘虏。我的女儿的意见也是这样。这是一场毫无意义的战争，我们对中国毫无仇恨。这是美国人的战争，我们从这场战争中得不到任何好处。”理查斯太太的女婿在朝鲜被俘。伦敦莱姆贝斯的瓦尔士太太的兄弟也是俘虏。瓦尔士太太说：“我希望战争结束。我完全不懂，为什么把我们的青年派到那里去。”萨利郡阿尔福德的爱利克尔先生有个儿子是俘虏。他要求美国人迅速同意交换俘虏。【新华社二十二日讯】据电通社伦敦二十日讯：英国和平委员会十九日提出警告说：朝鲜战争会延长的危机已比任何时候都严重了。委员会号召英国人民“把下一个星期日，即十二月二十三日，定为朝鲜星期日”。英国和平委员会的执行委员会发表声明说：“让我们每一个人用自己的方法来参加那一天的活动。以争取和解、实现和平。让我们想一想那些在朝鲜丧失了亲人的人们，那些焦急地等待着回家团聚的英国、美国和朝鲜的战俘们；让我们以我们的努力来表示我们对他们的同情。”委员会号召具有各种不同见解的爱好和平的人们向他们的议会议员、向英国首相及美国总统杜鲁门写信，要求在朝鲜实现和平。最后委员会向英国所有的爱好和平的人们呼吁，要求他们为五大国缔结和平公约宣言征集千千万万的签名。
