(Xinhua News Agency, December 27th) The total amount of payments for the people's donation for airplanes and cannons has greatly exceeded the predetermined target. This movement will victoriously complete its mission by the end of this month. Currently, with the exception of a few provinces, cities, and units that have not yet completed the payment task, the vast majority of provinces, cities, and units have exceeded their original pledged figures. According to statistics from the China People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters: as of December 26th, the actual donations paid by the people nationwide reached over 4,728 billion yuan, equivalent to 3,152 fighter planes, exceeding the original pledged amount by 19 percent. Among them, the East China region paid 1,872.8 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by 36 percent; the Central South region paid 1,043 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by 13 percent; the Southwest region paid 397 billion yuan, exceeding the plan by 16 percent; the Northeast region paid 535.8 billion yuan, exceeding the plan by 9 percent; the North China region paid 663.8 billion yuan, exceeding the plan by 15 percent; the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region paid 34.9 billion yuan, exceeding the plan by 47 percent; the Northwest region paid 180.7 billion yuan, accounting for 88 percent of the original donation plan, among which Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai provinces and Xi'an city have all exceeded the donation plan.

The movement to donate airplanes and cannons was initiated by the China People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters on June 1st of this year. This is an unprecedented large-scale, mass patriotic movement. This movement has been carried out vigorously throughout the country for half a year. The actual achievements reached now far exceed the original target. The achievement of this great achievement is first and foremost because the people across the country have generally received patriotic and internationalist education in the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement, and their patriotic enthusiasm has been greatly enhanced, so they have actively invested in this movement. The broad masses of workers and staff across the country have launched a production increase and donation competition. Shanghai workers donated 62 fighter planes with the income from increased production, exceeding their original plan by 24 percent. After the autumn harvest, farmers in various regions actively donated increased production of grain, cotton, and cash crops. When the peasants of Xiayu Township, Lanxi County, Zhejiang collectively donated grain, they inserted many small flags on the rice, with some flags writing: "Donate good grains of rice, buy airplanes that are awesome, fly to Korea to protect peace." On September 3rd, a huge "Donation Day" was held in various parts of northern Sichuan. On this day, people from all over the country danced the秧歌 (yangge), beat gongs and drums, and carried donation boxes to the donation stations to pay their donations, collecting a total of 4.2 billion yuan in one day. Secondly, the achievement of this great achievement is because this donation is closely linked to increased production, which has given full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. The broad masses of the people have created many methods to improve production in the donation movement. Workers, farmers, business circles, and people from all walks of life have formulated plans to increase production and donate, which ensures the completion of the donation targets. Thirdly, the achievement of this great achievement is because the people in various regions have created many practical and feasible methods in the donation movement. For example: the industrial and commercial circles in Shenyang City established a production increase and donation committee to uniformly lead various industries to formulate donation plans and payment work; the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan, Shenyang, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Dalian and other cities launched friendly payment competitions with each other; the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities held collective payment broadcast rallies; many private factories signed labor-capital production increase and donation contracts; rural cooperatives in northern Jiangsu collected farmers' donations on behalf of them, and so on. These methods have ensured the successful completion of the production increase and donation plan.

The people's patriotic donation movement has played a very significant role in politics, economy, and national defense. First of all, it has powerfully supported the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea struggle and boosted the morale of the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers. When the soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army heard the news of the nationwide donation of airplanes and cannons during the blocking battle in Tieyuan, they cheered excitedly. Then they launched a victorious blocking battle and annihilated a large number of enemies as a return gift to the people of the motherland. Chen Yichu, a soldier of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, said: "With such enthusiastic support from the people of the motherland, I have greater confidence in defeating the enemy." Secondly, the donation movement promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production. The broad masses of workers and staff across the country closely combined donation with increased production, actively improved technology, saved raw materials, and gave full play to the potential of machinery, thus creating a large amount of wealth for the country. For example, after formulating a donation plan, the famous Ma Hengchang team increased the utilization rate of machinery and equipment, which can increase the value of more than 1.2 million yuan of wealth every day. The broad masses of farmers across the country have implemented production increase and donation methods such as improving farming techniques and developing sideline production. This year alone, Tianjin Prefecture increased the production of 300 million catties of agricultural products. Farmers in many places said happily: "The production increase and donation movement really boosts our production!" When formulating donation plans, business circles in various places mostly started with improving operations and accelerating capital turnover, thereby developing business. For example, the asbestos processing industry in Shenyang City improved its management and administration in the donation movement, and its output and income have increased significantly. Thirdly, the donation movement has further improved the political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country, laying a good foundation for the large-scale production increase and thrift campaign that will be launched throughout the country.

In this donation movement, some regions and units had deviations such as forced apportionment and simply emptying their pockets, but these deviations were corrected in a timely manner.

Now the people across the country are carrying out the intensive work of ending the donation, and are guiding their patriotic enthusiasm into a larger-scale production increase and thrift campaign.

    爱国捐献缴款总数超过预定目标
    全国缴款四万七千余亿元
    各地人民正开展更大规模增产节约运动
    【新华社二十七日讯】全国人民捐献飞机大炮的缴款总数已大大超过了预定目标。这一运动，在本月月底即将胜利完成任务。目前除个别省、市和单位尚未完成缴款任务外，绝大多数的省、市和单位都已超额完成了原来的认捐数字。据中国人民抗美援朝总会统计：到本月二十六日为止，全国人民实缴捐款已达四万七千二百八十亿余元，折合战斗机三千一百五十二架，超过原来认捐数百分之十九。其中华东区缴款一万八千七百二十八亿元，超过原订计划百分之三十六，中南区缴款一万零四百三十亿元，超过原订计划百分之十三，西南区缴款三千九百七十亿元，超过计划百分之十六；东北区缴款五千三百五十八亿元，超过计划百分之九；华北区缴款六千六百三十八亿元，超过计划百分之十五；内蒙古自治区缴款三百四十九亿元，超过计划百分之四十七；西北区缴款一千八百零七亿元，占原订捐献计划的百分之八十八，其中甘肃、宁夏、青海三省和西安市都已超额完成了捐献计划。
    捐献飞机大炮运动是中国人民抗美援朝总会在今年六月一日发起的。这是一项空前规模的、群众性的爱国主义运动。这个运动在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地进行了半年之久。现在实际所达到的成就已远远超过了原定的目标。这个伟大成就的获得，首先是因为全国人民在抗美援朝运动中普遍地受到了爱国主义和国际主义的教育，爱国热情大大提高，因而都积极地投入这一运动。全国广大职工都展开了增产捐献竞赛，上海工人以增产所得捐献了六十二架战斗机，超过他们原订计划百分之二十四。各地农民在秋收后纷纷捐献增产的粮食、棉花和经济作物。浙江兰溪县下余乡农民集体献粮时，在稻谷上插了许多面小旗，有的旗上写着：“捐献稻谷粒粒好，买起飞机呱呱叫，飞到朝鲜把和平保。”川北各地在九月三日举办了规模巨大的“捐献日”，各地人民在这天扭着秧歌，打起锣鼓，抬着捐献箱到捐献站去缴款，一天中共缴纳了四十二亿元。其次，这个伟大成就的获得，是因为这次捐献是紧紧地结合着增产进行的，这样就发挥了广大人民的积极性。广大人民在捐献运动中创造了许多改进生产的方法，工人、农民、工商界以及其他各界人民都订出了增产捐献计划，这就保证了捐献目标的完成。第三，这个伟大成就的获得，是因为各地人民在捐献运动中创造出许多切实可行的办法。例如：沈阳市工商界成立了增产捐献委员会，统一领导各行业订立捐献计划和缴款工作；武汉、沈阳、兰州、西安、大连等城市的工商界相互展开了友谊的缴款竞赛；北京、上海等市工商界举办集体缴款的广播大会；不少私营工厂订立了劳资增产捐献合同；苏北农村合作社代收农民捐款等等。这些办法都保证了增产捐献计划的胜利完成。
    全国人民的爱国捐献运动，在政治上、经济上和国防上都起了十分巨大的作用。首先，它有力地支援了抗美援朝斗争，鼓舞了中朝人民战士的士气。中国人民志愿军某部战士在铁原阻击战中，听到祖国人民发起捐献飞机大炮运动的消息时，他们都兴奋得欢呼起来，接着他们就展开了胜利的阻击战，歼灭了大量敌人，作为对祖国人民的回礼。志愿军某部战士陈以初说：“在祖国人民这样热烈的支援下，我有更高的信心打败敌人。”其次，捐献运动促进了工农业生产的发展。全国广大职工将捐献和增产密切地结合起来，积极地改进技术，节省原料，发挥机器潜力，因而替国家创造了大量财富。例如著名的马恒昌小组订出捐献计划后，提高了机器设备的利用率，每天可以增加价值一百二十多万元的财富。全国广大农民实行了提高耕作技术、发展副业生产等增产捐献办法，单是天津专区今年就增产了三亿斤农作物。许多地方的农民都兴高采烈地说：“增产捐献运动真给我们的生产加油打气啦！”各地工商界在制订捐献计划时，大都从改善经营、加速资金周转等方面着手，因而发展了营业。例如沈阳市石绵加工业在捐献运动中改善了经营管理，产量和收入都有显著增加。第三，捐献运动又进一步提高了全国人民的政治觉悟和爱国热情，为即将在全国范围内广泛展开的增产节约运动打下良好的基础。
    在这次捐献运动中，某些地区和单位曾经发生了强迫摊派、单纯掏腰包等偏向，但这些偏向都及时地得到了纠正。
    现在全国人民正在进行紧张的捐献结束工作，并正把他们的爱国热情引导到更大规模的增产节约运动中去。
