Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, received a notification from Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee and Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, regarding the awarding of the Stalin International Peace Prize. Guo Moruo sent a reply telegram on the 22nd, expressing his gratitude and announcing that he would donate the entire 100,000 rubles of the prize money to the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, for the purpose of defending the cause of peace. The texts of the two telegrams are as follows:

Skobeltsyn's telegram:

Most beloved Mr. Guo Moruo:

I am writing to inform you promptly that the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, convened on December 20, 1951, has awarded you the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Peace Prize in recognition of your outstanding achievements in the cause of defending and strengthening peace.

I must also report to you that, according to the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on December 20, 1949, those who are awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize will receive a gold Stalin Medal and a prize of 100,000 rubles. We would be very happy if you could find the time to come to Moscow to complete the award ceremony. If you cannot come to Moscow, then the committee will send a representative, prepared with the medal and prize money, to your country to hold the award ceremony in order to achieve the above purpose. Or, if you have any valuable suggestions, please submit them for our reference. Please notify the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee immediately after deciding on a method.

With the most profound respect!

Guo Moruo's reply telegram:

To Academician Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Peace Prize Committee:

Most beloved Mr. Academician Skobeltsyn, I received your kind telegram and learned that I have been awarded the 1951 "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Peace Prize. This is truly the greatest honor of my life. This is not only a great encouragement to me personally, but also a great encouragement to the entire Chinese people. In the future, I will continue to redouble my efforts in the work of defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression, in the hope of making more practical contributions, living up to the great name of the great Marshal Stalin, and truly worthy of commemorating the longevity of the great Marshal Stalin. I would like to go to Moscow in person next year to accept this greatest honor, but I would like you to decide the timing. For example, it would be most appropriate for all or most of the award recipients to receive the award in Moscow at the same time, and to hold the award ceremony in Moscow. If this is possible, please notify me of the selected time.

I am willing to donate all 100,000 rubles of the prize money to the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, to be used for the cause of defending peace. Please allow me to report this intention to you first.

With the most profound respect!

    郭沫若电复斯科贝尔琴
    决定明年亲自赴莫斯科接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    愿将奖金献给中国人民保卫和平反美侵略委员会
     【新华社二十四日讯】中国科学院院长郭沫若收到“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席、苏联科学院院士斯科贝尔琴关于授予斯大林国际和平奖金的通知。郭沫若已于二十二日复电，表示感谢，并宣布将把奖金十万卢布全部献给中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，作为保卫和平事业之用。两电电文如下：
        斯科贝尔琴的来电最亲爱的郭沫若先生：
    我迅速通知您，一九五一年十二月二十日召开的 “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会，为了您在保卫和加强和平的斗争事业中的卓越功绩，特授予您“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金。
    还须向您报告，根据一九四九年十二月二十日苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议，凡荣获斯大林国际和平奖金者，将获得金质斯大林奖章和奖金十万卢布。我们很欢迎您能抽暇来莫斯科一行，以便完成授奖典礼。如果您不能来莫斯科，那末委员会为了达成上述目的，将派代表准备好奖章和奖金前来贵国举行授奖典礼。或者您有什么宝贵意见，请提出来供我们参考。请您于决定办法后，立即通知斯大林国际和平奖金委员会。
        此致最崇高的敬礼！
        郭沫若的复电 “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席斯科贝尔琴院士：
    最亲爱的斯科贝尔琴院士先生，我接到您亲切的电报，知道了我获得一九五一年度“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金，这真是我有生以来的最大的荣幸。这不仅是对于我个人的极大的鼓励，而同时是对于全中国人民的极大的鼓励。我今后在保卫世界和平反对侵略战争的工作中要不断地加倍努力，以期能够有更实际的贡献，不负伟大的斯大林大元帅的英名，真正足以纪念斯大林大元帅的万寿无疆。我想明年亲自到莫斯科接受这最大的荣誉，只是时期我要请您决定。例如受奖者的全体或其中大部分人能够同时在莫斯科受奖，在莫斯科举行授奖典礼，应该是最适当的办法。如果可以这样做，就请您把选定的时期通知我。
    奖金十万卢布，我愿意全部献给中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，以作为保卫和平事业之用，请允许我先把这个预定向您报告。此致最崇高的敬礼！
