The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has not only educated and reformed the staff in revolutionary government organs, but has also enlightened the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people. Here, let me introduce a fact about the people of Andong City, Northeast China, exposing embezzlers.

Back in September, Zhang Zongxian, a citizen of Jintang District in Andong City, saw that all the organs in the city were carrying out the movement against corruption, degeneration, and bureaucracy, and said excitedly, "This has never happened before; the Communist Party and the People's Government are truly glorious, great, and correct." He thought to himself, "The Communist Party and the People's Government are so serious and responsible to the people, how can we be worthy of the Communist Party and the People's Government?"

He lived in Group Four of Liangshi Street. He used to live in the same courtyard as the family of Shi Jiqing, the chief of the Planning Section of the Municipal Taxation Bureau (now the deputy chief of the Planning Section of the Provincial Taxation Bureau). In the past, whenever there were New Year's festivals or weddings, merchants would send gifts to the Shi family. Although Zhang Zongxian knew about these things, he didn't mention them at all because he didn't have a clear understanding. Since the launch of the anti-corruption and degeneration movement, he thought, "Shi Jiqing is a cadre, accepting bribes from private merchants will definitely cause losses to the country. If I expose him, it won't look good on him; if I don't expose him, he will be finished and the country may suffer even greater losses. What should I do?" This contradiction triggered a fierce struggle in his mind. After repeated consideration, Zhang Zongxian thought again, "I am a people's representative of the district. In order to respond to the government's call, and to shoulder the responsibility entrusted to me by the people—to protect the interests of the country and the people—I should expose him." He finally mustered the courage to expose these facts about Shi Jiqing at the Second Session of the Third People's Representative Conference of Andong City on September 25, which was warmly welcomed by the people's representatives present.

After the People's Representative Conference, Shi Jiqing knew that his problem had been exposed. He still refused to admit his mistake. His wife went to the neighborhood near Zhang Zongxian's house in Liangshi Street to spread rumors and scold, "That kid Representative Zhang is too bad at doing things. There is no hatred or grudge, he called him 'Uncle' all the time, how could he do this thing!" Shi Jiqing himself also went to Zhang Zongxian twice to inquire about the news. Zhang Zongxian felt uneasy after hearing what Shi Jiqing's wife said, so he didn't meet Shi Jiqing. At that time, individual backward merchants also complained that Zhang Zongxian was doing the wrong thing, and even satirized and attacked Zhang; Zhang's wife also lost her temper. When Zhang Zongxian encountered these obstacles, his thinking changed again: "Shi Jiqing is a section chief, and I am an ordinary person. Isn't this courting disaster!" He also became uneasy.

However, this kind of wrong idea could only be temporary. Because many people improved their political understanding through this movement, and felt that Zhang Zongxian's actions were patriotic, they all put forward opinions to the government, asking Shi Jiqing to admit his mistakes. After discovering this problem, the Provincial and Municipal People's Supervisory Committee immediately conducted an investigation and confirmed that Shi Jiqing had indeed caused serious losses to the country by accepting bribes from private merchants, which enabled the private merchants to evade national taxes. For example, Shi Jiqing knew that a certain paper shop was making false accounts, but he did not check the accounts because he had accepted bribes, causing the business to evade tens of millions of yuan in taxes. Based on this situation, the Provincial and Municipal Personnel Bureau and the Provincial and Municipal Taxation Bureau not only praised Zhang Zongxian's actions, but also urged Shi Jiqing to confess his mistakes to the masses.

On October 17, the Jintang District of Andong City held a People's Representative Conference. At the meeting, Shi Jiqing confessed his mistakes to the masses, criticized his own behavior, made a review to Zhang Zongxian and the people of the whole district, expressed that he would resolutely correct his mistakes, and hoped that the people would supervise him. Zhang Zongxian was greatly moved by the government's praise and seeing Shi Jiqing apologizing to him. He said, "I have never heard of a government official apologizing to the common people in the past; at today's meeting, Section Chief Shi not only confessed his mistakes, but also expressed that he would correct his mistakes with practical actions in the future, which truly shows the People's Government's high sense of responsibility to the people, which makes me further realize my own government." Under his leadership, many people on the spot exposed embezzlers.

    张宗显终于检举了贪污分子
    姚善堂
    反贪污腐化、反官僚主义的斗争，不仅教育改造了革命政权机关里的工作人员，而且也启发了广大人民的政治觉悟。这里，让我介绍一件东北安东市人民检举贪污分子的事实吧。
    还是九月的时候，安东市金汤区一个市民——张宗显，看到全市各机关开展反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义运动后，兴奋地说：“这是从来没有过的事；共产党和人民政府真光荣、伟大、正确。”他这样想：“共产党和人民政府对人民这样认真负责，我们怎样才能对得起共产党和人民政府呢？”
    他住在粮市街四组。原先和市税务局计划科长石积庆（现在是省税务局计划科副科长）的家属住一个院。过去，每逢年节或办喜事的时候，就有商人给石家送礼。张宗显虽然知道这些事，因为他认识不清，所以根本就没有提过这些事。自从开展反贪污蜕化运动以后，他想：“石积庆是个干部，接受私商贿赂，一定会使国家受到损失。我检举吧，对他不好看；不检举吧，这样下去他就完了，国家也可能受更大的损失，怎么办呢？”这一矛盾，在他思想上展开了激烈的斗争。张宗显经过再三的思考，他又这样想：“我是区的人民代表，为了响应政府的号召，为了担负起人民所托付的责任——保护国家和人民的利益，我应该检举。”他终于鼓起勇气于九月二十五日那天，在安东市二届三次各界人民代表会议上揭发了石积庆的这些事实，受到了到会人民代表的热烈欢迎。

    人民代表会议开过后，石积庆知道自己的问题被揭发。他还不认错。他的老婆到粮市街张宗显家附近的邻舍放风，并谩骂：“张代表这个小子作事太坏了，一无冤二无仇，一口一个‘大叔’叫着，他怎么能作出这个事呢！”石积庆本人也曾两次找张宗显探听消息，张宗显因听了石积庆的老婆这些话而心里不安，也没见石积庆。当时，个别落后商人也埋怨张宗显作事不对，甚至对张讽刺打击；张的老婆也大发脾气。张宗显碰到这些阻力，思想又发生了变化：“石积庆是个科长，我是个老百姓，这不是惹下祸了吗！”情绪也不安起来了。
    可是，这种错误的想法也只能是暂时的。因为许多人通过这次运动提高了政治认识，觉得张宗显的行动是爱国的行为，都纷纷向政府提意见，要求石积庆承认错误。省、市人民监察委员会发现这个问题后，立即进行调查，确实证明石积庆由于接受了私商贿赂，使私商偷漏国税，给国家造成严重的损失。如石积庆明知某纸店造假账，因自己受贿而不去查账，使该商号漏了好几千万元的税款。省、市人事局及省、市税务局根据这一情况，除表扬了张宗显的行动外，并督促石积庆向群众坦白认错。

    十月十七日，安东市金汤区召开了人民代表会议。会上，石积庆向群众坦白了自己的错误，批判了自己的行为，向张宗显和全区人民作了检讨，表示要坚决改正错误，并希望人民群众监督。张宗显受到政府的表扬，又看到石积庆向他道歉，受了很大的感动。他说：“过去没听说过有那个政府的官员向老百姓道歉；在今天的会上，石科长不但坦白认错，还表示今后以实际行动痛改前非，真是表现了人民政府对人民的高度负责精神，这使我更进一步地认识了自己的政府。”在他的带动下，当场又有不少人检举了贪污分子。
