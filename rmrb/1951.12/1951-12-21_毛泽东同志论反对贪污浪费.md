Editor's Note: Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly instructed us in his works over the years to practice streamlining and economy, oppose corruption, and oppose waste. What is published here is a selection of these instructions from Comrade Mao Zedong. Although most of these instructions were made before the founding of the People's Republic of China, their spirit is still applicable to our current struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. It is hoped that all comrades in the Party will pay attention to studying them and use them to guide the current struggle.

　　Financial expenditure should be based on the principle of saving. All government workers should understand that corruption and waste are extremely serious crimes. The struggle against corruption and waste has achieved some success in the past, and efforts should continue to be made in the future. Saving every penny for the cause of war and revolution, and for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system. We should strictly distinguish our method of using national income from that of the Kuomintang. ("Our Economic Policy," January 23, 1934)
　　Communists in government work should be models of integrity, employing no private individuals, doing more work, and taking less remuneration. Communists in the mass movement should be friends of the people, not their superiors, tireless teachers, not bureaucratic politicians. Communists should never put personal interests first at any time or place, and personal interests should be subordinate to the interests of the nation and the masses. Therefore, selfishness, laziness, corruption, and showmanship are the most despicable. The spirit of selflessness, active effort, self-denial, and hard work are worthy of respect and emulation. ("The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War," October 1938)
　　This streamlining of troops and administration must be strict, thorough, and universal; not perfunctory, superficial, or partial. In this streamlining of troops and administration, we must achieve the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and opposition to bureaucracy. These five items are extremely important for our economic and financial work. After streamlining, the reduction of consumer spending and the increase in production income will not only directly benefit finance, but also reduce the burden on the people and affect the people's economy. The bad phenomena of disunity, independence, and each doing its own thing in the economic and financial work organizations must be overcome, and a unified work system must be established that is well-commanded and enables policies and systems to be thoroughly implemented. After this unified system is established, work efficiency can be increased. Economy should be paid attention to by all working organs, especially economic and financial work organs. The result of implementing economy can save a large number of unnecessary and wasteful expenditures, the amount of which can reach tens of millions. Personnel engaged in economic and financial work must also overcome the bureaucratic practices that exist, some of which are still very serious, such as corruption, putting on airs, useless formalism, and red tape. If we fully implement these five requirements in the Party, government, and military systems, then our streamlining of troops and administration will have achieved its purpose, our difficulties will certainly be overcome, and the mouths of those who laugh at us for being about to collapse can be shut. ("Economic Problems and Financial Problems," December 1942)
　　Many units below each do their own thing, and the above has no or lacks unified guidance, unified planning, and unified inspection in terms of policy principles and work content, so that each part does not know what should not be done, or knowingly violates it. As a result, the matter of each doing its own thing and making independence also occurred. Things that violate policy principles and violate government laws and regulations have also occurred. Things that infringe upon the interests of the people have also occurred. Among various economic units, not only is there no assistance, but instead there are mutual struggles and mutual obstruction. The phenomenon of concealing from superiors but not from subordinates, concealing from both superiors and subordinates, ambushing, and telling lies has also occurred. The phenomenon of extreme waste, spending a fortune, seeking extravagance, and not seeking practical results has also occurred. Especially serious is the occurrence of extremely bad phenomena such as corruption and gambling among some cadres. Some individual cadres are tempted by material things, and are therefore unwilling to be loyal to the sacred cause of communism and are completely corrupted. Other cadres have become moldy and need to be exposed to the sun to regain their health. All these bad things, all these malpractices, have occurred to varying degrees among the cadres of some troops and some organs and schools. In the future, all superior leading organs of all troops and organs and schools must focus on taking care of the overall situation, grasping policies, and have unified plans and unified inspections for the production activities of their subordinate units, and absolutely no longer allow the phenomena of each doing its own thing, independence, violation of policies, violation of laws and regulations, infringement of the interests of the people, mutual struggles and mutual obstruction between units, and corruption, waste, and gambling among cadres to occur again. If these phenomena occur again, discipline must be strictly enforced, and those who are lenient will be criticized, and those who are severe will be punished, and they must not be condoned, but rather praised as "lenient policies." This is the rectification in economic work, and we must implement it without hesitation. (Ibid.)
　　Any public servant who works in the public economy, if he seeks special interests for himself personally, is called a loss of morality in our ranks, and is called committing the crime of corruption in law. And all those who are not corrupt, do not waste, are loyal, and work for the Party and the country are people of high moral character and should be praised and rewarded by the Party and the government. In the army, this point should be explained to the soldiers. (Ibid.)
　　One point must also be brought to the attention of our comrades at the front. Some of our places have not been opened up for long and are still quite rich, but the staff there rely on their wealth and are unwilling to save or produce. This is very bad, and they will definitely suffer in the future. Any place must cherish human and material resources and must not only care about the present and abuse and waste them. Any place must calculate from the year it starts working to many years in the future, calculate to long-term persistence in the war, calculate to the counter-offensive, and calculate to the construction after the enemy has left. On the one hand, never abuse or waste, and on the other hand, strive to develop production. In the past, some places lacked long-term plans, and neither paid attention to saving human and material resources nor paid attention to developing production, and suffered great losses. Having learned this lesson, we must now pay attention to it. ("Completely Learn Economic Work in Two or Three Years," January 10, 1945)
　　Select cadres who are politically stronger and more capable at work to manage the production and supply work of various departments. Existing economic cadres must be reviewed, and those who are incompetent and those who have committed corruption and corruption errors must be transferred to work, and some particularly serious ones must be given due punishment. (Ibid.)
　　When promoting various tasks in the Liberated Areas, it is necessary to cherish the local human and material resources, and any place must make long-term plans to avoid abuse and waste. This is not only for defeating the Japanese, but also for building a new China. ("On the Coalition Government," April 24, 1945)
　　Because of victory, feelings of pride within the Party, feelings of considering oneself a meritorious minister, feelings of stagnation and not seeking progress, feelings of seeking pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life again may grow. Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come out to support us. The enemy is unable to conquer us, and this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's flattery may conquer those with weak wills in our ranks. There may be some Communists who have not been conquered by enemies with guns, and they are worthy of the title of heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation. (Resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, March 13, 1949)
　　Everyone understands that if the American army had not occupied our country's Taiwan, invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and attacked our country's northeastern border, the Chinese people would not have fought the American army. But since the American invaders have attacked us, we cannot but raise the banner of anti-aggression, which is completely necessary and completely just, and the people of the whole country have understood this necessity and justice. In order to continue to adhere to this necessary and just struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting the United States and aiding Korea, and need to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is the central task of the Chinese people today, and therefore it is also the central task of this meeting. ("Opening Speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," October 23, 1951)

    毛泽东同志论反对贪污浪费
    编者按：毛泽东同志在历年著作中曾多次指示我们要实行精简节约，反对贪污，反对浪费。这里所刊登的就是毛泽东同志的这些指示的一部分摘录。这些指示的大部虽是中华人民共和国成立以前所作，但是它们的精神，对于我们今天所进行的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，仍然是适用的。希望全党同志注意加以研究，来指导当前的斗争。
    财政的支出，应该根据节省的方针。应该使一切政府工作人员明白，贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。反对贪污和浪费的斗争，过去有了些成绩，以后还应用力。节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则。我们对于国家收入的使用方法，应该和国民党的方法有严格的区别。（“我们的经济政策”，一九三四年
    一月二十三日）共产党员在政府工作中，应该是十分廉洁，不用私人，多做工作，少取报酬的模范。共产党员在民众运动中，应该是民众的朋友，而不是民众的上司，是诲人不倦的教师，而不是官僚主义的政客。共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，个人利益服从于民族的与群众的利益。因此，自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的。而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干等等精神，才是值得尊敬的模范。（“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”，一九三八年十月）
    这一次精兵简政，必须是严格的、彻底的、普遍的；而不是敷衍的、不痛不痒的、或局部的。在这次精兵简政中，必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约与反对官僚主义五项目的。这五项，对于我们的经济工作与财政工作，关系极大。精简之后，减少了消费性的支出，增加了生产的收入，不但直接给与财政以好影响，而且可以减少人民的负担，影响人民的经济。经济与财政工作机构中的不统一、闹独立性、各自为政等恶劣现象，必须克服，而建立统一的、指挥如意的、使政策与制度能贯彻到底的工作系统。这种统一系统建立后，工作效能就可以增加。节约是一切工作机关都要注意的，经济与财政工作机关尤其要注意。实行节约的结果，可以节省一大批不必要的与浪费性的支出，其数目可以达到几千万。从事经济与财政业务的工作人员，还必须克服存在着的有些还是很严重的官僚主义，例如贪污现象，摆空架子，无益的正规化，文牍主义等等。如果我们把这五项要求在党部、政府、军队各个系统中完全实行起来，那我们的这次精兵简政，就算达到了目的，我们的困难就一定能克服，那些笑我们会要塌台的人的嘴巴也就可以被我们封住了。（“经济问题与财政问题”，一九四二年十二月）
    下面多少单位各自为政，上面没有或缺少在政策原则上与工作内容上的统一的指导、统一的计划与统一的检查，致使各部分不知道什么事是不应该做的，或者明知故犯。于是各自为政，闹独立性的事也发生了。破坏政策原则，破坏政府法令的事也发生了。侵害人民利益的事也发生了。各个经济单位之间，不但没有协助，反而互相斗争，互相妨碍的事也发生了。瞒上不瞒下，瞒上又瞒下，打埋伏，说谎话的现象也发生了。极端浪费，一掷千金，但求铺张，不求实效的现象也发生了。尤其严重的，是在一部分干部之间发生了贪污赌博等极恶劣的现象。有个别的干部是被物质所诱惑，因而不愿忠实于共产主义的神圣事业，完全腐化了。另有若干干部则起了霉，要在太阳底下晒一晒才能恢复健康。所有这些坏事，所有这些弊端，在一部分军队与一部分机关学校的干部中，都是或多或少地发生过的。今后所有军队与机关学校的一切上级领导机关，必须着重于照顾全局，掌握政策，对所属各单位的生产活动一定要有统一的计划，统一的检查，绝对不容许再有各自为政，闹独立性，破坏政策，破坏法令，侵害人民利益，各单位互相斗争，互相妨碍，以及干部中贪污浪费赌博等现象再行发生。如再有这类现象发生，必须严申纪律，轻者批评，重者处罚，决不可对他们纵容，反而美其名曰“宽大政策”。这就是经济工作中的整风，我们必须毫不犹豫的执行。（同上）
    凡在公营经济中做事的公务人员，如果他为自己个人图谋特殊利益，在我们队伍中就叫做丧失道德的行为，在法律上就叫做犯了贪污罪。而一切不贪污、不浪费、忠心耿耿、为党为国的人，就算是有高尚道德的人，应受到党与政府的称赞及奖励。在军队中，应将这点向战士说明。（同上）
    有一点还须引起我们前方同志的注意。我们有些地方开辟不久，还颇富足，但是那里的工作人员自恃富足，不肯节省，也不肯生产。这样就很不好，他们在将来一定要吃亏的。任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。任何地方必须从开始工作的那一年起，就计算到将来很多年，计算到长期坚持战争，计算到反攻，计算到敌人走了之后的建设。一面决不滥用浪费，一面努力发展生产。过去有些地方缺少长期打算，既未注意节省人力物力，又未注意发展生产，吃了大亏。得了这个教训，现在必须引起注意。（“两三年内完全学会经济工作”，一九四五年一月十日）
    选择政治上与工作能力上比较更强的干部去管理各部门的生产与供给工作。现有的经济干部须加以审查，不称职的及犯贪污腐化错误的人必须调动工作，有些特别严重的并须予以应得的处罚。（同上）
    在推进解放区的各项工作时，必须十分爱惜当地的人力物力，任何地方均要作长期打算，避免滥用与浪费。这不但是为着打败日本人，而且是为着建设新中国。（“论联合政府”，一九四五年四月二十四日）
    因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。（中国共产党第七届第二次中央委员会全体会议决议，一九四九年三月十三日）
    大家都明白，如果不是美国军队占领我国的台湾，侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和打到了我国的东北边疆，中国人民是不会和美国军队作战的。但是既然美国侵略者已经向我们进攻了，我们就不能不举起反侵略的旗帜，这是完全必要的和完全正义的，全国人民都已明白这种必要性和正义性。为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务，因此也就是我们这次会议的中心任务。（“中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议开会词”，一九五一年十月二十三日）
