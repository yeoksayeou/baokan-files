    The National Textile Industry Conference has determined that the overall goal for increased production and savings in the national public and private textile industry next year is 3.78 trillion yuan. The conference began on the 3rd of this month and closed on the 11th. A total of 110 representatives from public and private cotton, wool, hemp, silk, printing and dyeing, reproduction, and textile machinery enterprises and trade union representatives from all over the country attended the conference.
    The conference determined that increasing production and practicing economy is the central task of all departments of the textile industry in 1952. The conference decided that in 1952, the national textile industry should increase production and save wealth worth 3,784.4 billion yuan for the country outside the production plan, and strive to reach 4 trillion yuan. Because the raw materials for the textile industry are not yet abundant and the equipment utilization rate cannot be fully utilized, the conference decided to increase the production of 100,000 bales of cotton yarn (which can weave 3.6 million bolts of cloth) and 1.95 million sacks through efforts to save raw materials. It was also decided to increase the production of 50,000 spindles of textile machinery and reduce costs from all aspects to accelerate the turnover of working capital.
    The conference discussed and approved the 1952 national textile industry production plan. According to this plan, the national output of cotton yarn in 1952 will exceed the highest annual output in China's history by 39%, exceeding the actual output this year by 28.3%; cotton cloth will exceed this year by 28.97%; sacks will exceed by 81.51%; raw silk will exceed by 25%; textile machinery will exceed by 300%; and looms will exceed by 40%.
    In order to complete the 1952 production plan and increase production and savings plan, the conference determined that national state-owned textile factories should implement an economic accounting system from 1952, with each factory operating independently and being responsible for its own profits and losses. Private factories should also improve their operation and management in 1952 through the movement to increase production and practice economy, according to the actual situation. In order to achieve the above objectives, the conference determined that each factory must: First, strengthen planning management. Establish and improve the planning work system at all levels to ensure the completion of the production plan. Second, strengthen technical management. All technical work should focus on saving raw materials, improving quality, and reducing defective products. Around this center, solve various technical problems. Third, strive to adjust and implement a reasonable wage system and reward system in 1952. Fourth, earnestly train cadres, hold various short-term training courses, and open factory spare-time technical schools to train a large number of middle and lower-level technical cadres and business cadres; and do our best to help on-the-job cadres conduct self-education and self-transformation.
    The conference also determined that in 1952, the Hao Jianxiu work method and the 1951 weaving work method would continue to be promoted nationwide, and excellent maintenance work methods and other work methods would continue to be studied, and a series of complete work methods for cotton, wool, hemp, silk, and other textile production would be gradually formulated and promoted nationwide.
    At the end of the conference, Zhang Qinqiu, Vice Minister of the Textile Industry Department of the Central People's Government, made a summary. She requested that the textile industry authorities in various regions, under the leadership and assistance of the local CCP committees, people's governments, and relevant departments, establish branches of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee according to industry, and be responsible for leading the increase production and practice economy movement in various regions and factories. She pointed out that the movement to increase production and practice economy must be combined with the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign; it must rely on the working class in the movement, conduct in-depth ideological mobilization among the workers and staff, launch and organize patriotic labor competitions, and award prizes in a timely manner to encourage the enthusiasm of workers and staff and keep the movement moving forward.
    During the conference, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De attended the meeting and gave a report. He called on all cadres, employees, and entrepreneurs in the textile industry to make contributions in the movement to increase production and practice economy.
    At the closing of the conference, all the representatives unanimously passed a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting the achievements of the conference and ensuring the realization of the 1952 production plan and the increase production and savings plan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国纺织工业会议确定争取明年增产节约达到四万亿元
    号召结合进行反贪污反浪费反官僚主义
    全国纺织工业会议确定全国公私营纺织工业明年增产节约的总目标是三万七千八百多亿元。这次会议在本月三日开始，十一日闭幕。出席会议的有全国各地公私营棉、毛、麻、丝、印染、复制、纺织机械等企业单位的代表和工会代表共一百一十人。
    会议确定增产节约是一九五二年纺织工业各个部门的中心任务。会议决定全国纺织工业一九五二年在生产计划之外，为国家增产节约价值三万七千八百四十四亿元的财富，并争取达到四万亿元。由于纺织工业的原料还不充裕，设备利用率还不能充分发挥，因此会议决定通过在节约原料方面的努力，增产棉纱十万件（可织三百六十万匹布），麻袋一百九十五万条。另决定增产纺机五万锭，并从各方面降低成本，加速流动资金的周转。
    会议讨论和通过了一九五二年全国纺织工业的生产计划。按照这个计划，一九五二年全国所产棉纱将超过我国历史上最高年产量百分之三十九，超过今年实际生产量百分之二十八点三；棉布将超过今年百分之二十八点九七；麻袋将超过百分之八十一点五一；生丝将超过百分之二十五；纺机将超过百分之三百；织机将超过百分之四十。
    为了完成一九五二年的生产计划和增产节约计划，会议确定全国国营纺织厂自一九五二年起实行经济核算制，各厂独立经营，自结盈亏；私营厂也要在一九五二年内通过增产节约运动，按照实际情况，改善经营管理。为了达到上述目的，会议确定明年各厂必须：第一，加强计划管理。建立和健全各级计划工作制度，保证生产计划的完成。第二，加强技术管理。一切技术工作应以节约原料、提高质量、减少次品为中心，环绕这一中心，解决技术上的各种问题。第三，争取在一九五二年调整和实行合理的工资制度及奖励制度。第四，认真培养干部，举办各种短期训练班和开办工厂业余技术学校，大量培养中下级技术干部和业务干部；并尽力帮助在职干部进行自我教育和自我改造。
    会议同时确定一九五二年继续在全国范围内推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法，继续研究优秀的保全工作法和其他工作法，逐步制订棉、毛、麻、丝等纺织生产上一系列的完整工作法，并推广到全国。
    会议最后由中央人民政府纺织工业部副部长张琴秋做总结。她要求各地区纺织工业主管部门在当地中共党委、人民政府及有关部门的领导和协助下，按行业成立增产节约委员会分会，负责领导各地区各厂的增产节约运动。她指出增产节约运动必须和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义结合进行；必须在运动中依靠工人阶级，在职工群众中进行深入的思想动员，发动和组织爱国主义劳动竞赛，及时评奖，以鼓励职工积极性，使运动不断前进。
    会议期间，朱德总司令曾到会作报告。他号召纺织工业的全体干部、职工和企业家们，在增产节约运动中立功。
    会议闭幕时，全体代表一致通过写信给毛主席，报告这次会议的成就，保证实现一九五二年的生产计划和增产节约计划。（新华社）
