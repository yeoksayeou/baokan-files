Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 21st: The Party representatives of the direct organs of the CPC Central Committee Southwest Bureau held a meeting on the 18th and 19th to discuss how to implement increased production and conservation, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy. At the meeting, Deng Xiaoping, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Southwest Bureau, delivered a report. In his report, Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Launching a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is currently the most important political task. This concerns the future of our country. Without this struggle, we will not have industrialization, nor will we have a socialist and communist future. He called on everyone to mobilize the masses inside and outside the Party, like the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and carry out this struggle vigorously.

The meeting discussed Deng Xiaoping's report. The representatives unanimously and firmly stated in their speeches that they would set an example and work with the masses inside and outside the Party to quickly launch this movement.

The meeting finally adopted a resolution on increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy. The resolution stipulates: (1) All Party committees, general branches, and branches should immediately take the movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy as the central political task and the main content of the rectification campaign. All major units should establish a thrift inspection committee, including responsible cadres from outside the Party, to guide and promote this work. Each department should set up an inspection team to be responsible for supervision and inspection. (2) In order to conduct the movement in a planned, step-by-step, and led manner, the general procedure for each unit to carry out the movement should be: (1) Universal mobilization. Organize cadres to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's opening remarks at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Stalin on Economy, Mao Zedong's "Combat Liberalism," Deng Xiaoping's report, and other documents; explain the great significance of the movement to all Party members and all staff, so as to raise the awareness of the broad masses inside and outside the Party and make them realize that corruption and waste are sinful acts that must be resolutely opposed. (2) Fully promote democracy. After mobilization, the masses should be immediately called upon to report, and confessions should also be encouraged. Combine top-down inspections with bottom-up exposure, and combine general inspections, mutual inspections, and key inspections. The leadership must resolutely support the masses, and attach importance to all opinions, materials, and accusations. (3) Issues must be clarified with a serious and responsible attitude, the nature must be distinguished, the circumstances must be distinguished, and they must be dealt with separately according to the size of the problem. (4) Hardworking and simple comrades should be rewarded and relied upon as the backbone of the movement; it is also necessary to strive for elements who have no major problems and can wake up early to play an active role in the movement. (5) The time for investigating corruption and waste shall generally be calculated from the time of liberation. Cases that have been dealt with in the past will not be pursued again. (6) Adopt various methods, such as using Party journals, Party newspapers, and internal wall newspapers of the organs, to vigorously call on the masses to report, publicize corruption and waste incidents, make the masses despise and hate corruption and waste, and resolutely fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucratic style. (3) After the inspection is completed, some necessary systems should be established on the basis of this movement, and plans for increasing production and practicing economy and improving work efficiency should be formulated. Every Party member should formulate or revise their patriotic covenant, set an example, and lead all staff.

(4) From now on, concentrate efforts for two months to carry out a rectification movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
