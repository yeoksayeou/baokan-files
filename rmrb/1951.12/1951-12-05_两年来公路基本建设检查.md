Inspection of Highway Infrastructure Construction Over the Past Two Years
Ministry of Transportation, Central People's Government

Over the past two years, China's highway infrastructure construction has achieved considerable success, but many serious problems still exist. This is the basic assessment of China's highway construction made by the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation at the Highway Infrastructure Construction Inspection Work Conference.

Lack of Careful Calculation and Thorough Planning Leads to Waste of Significant State Resources.

The main reason for the problems in highway infrastructure construction is that some leading cadres do not sufficiently recognize the importance of infrastructure construction and lack a spirit of careful calculation and thorough planning, resulting in extreme waste in infrastructure construction. This shortcoming is mainly manifested in:

First, when formulating plans, the technical conditions, mechanical equipment, material sources, organizational capabilities, and national financial resources are not carefully considered. They only hope to get more money, build more roads, set high standards, and undertake large projects, blindly accepting tasks without considering subjective conditions. As a result, not only are the tasks not well completed, but also serious waste and disorder occur. For example, in 1950, the Northeast Region built a highway without considering the source of asphalt, and blindly planned to build 37.4 kilometers of asphalt pavement. As a result, due to material constraints, only 3.6 kilometers were built. The Northwest Region invested more than 40 billion yuan in highway construction throughout last year, but actually only used more than 27 billion yuan, leaving more than 13 billion yuan of state funds idle.

Second, due to the lack of design or detailed survey and research, many design errors have been made; some designs have been hastily implemented without review and approval. This phenomenon is very common. The design of a bridge project in the Northwest Region, after actual investigation, was fundamentally different from the original preliminary design submitted. The Southwest Region built two bridges on the Kangqing Road and blindly decided to build steel frame bridges without design; after the steel frames were made in Chongqing and transported to the construction site, it was discovered that there was no need to build steel frame bridges, only wooden bridges were needed. When building a bridge in the Northwest Region, no drilling was done, and it was subjectively believed that the stone layer was very deep, so the design standard was determined. When driving piles, it was impossible to go deeper after four meters. Without research, the pile hammer was increased and hammering continued. It still could not go down. At this time, it was realized that something was wrong, and when it was dug open, it was found that the cement pile had been broken into pieces. This loss amounted to 250,000 catties of rice.

In addition, inadequate preparation, untimely supply of materials, loose work organization, and failure to make good construction arrangements and close coordination between various departments have also caused many losses.

These mistakes have caused great losses to the state. According to incomplete statistics: the loss in 1950 was more than 5.66 billion yuan. The loss already discovered in 1951 was more than 3.33 billion yuan. Other losses such as rework caused by design errors and rough construction; waste caused by material supply and transportation errors; and waste of migrant worker labor due to poor maintenance, will total a staggering figure.

What are the basic reasons for the waste?

First, it is because many leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance and seriousness of infrastructure construction, lack a spirit of careful planning, and only rely on enthusiasm and initiative to work, without proceeding from needs and possibilities, without considering subjective and objective conditions, and blindly carrying out infrastructure construction, causing significant losses to people's property. Second, some technicians still have the viewpoint of being hired, and they have not yet regarded the country's affairs as their own. They have not yet well established a viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people and a work style of seeking truth from facts. Therefore, strengthening the political and ideological education of technical personnel is a very important task.

How can we do a good job in highway infrastructure construction?

First, strengthening the leadership of infrastructure construction is the most important link in doing a good job in infrastructure construction. All cadres and technicians should be educated to regard infrastructure construction as a political issue and truly take responsibility for the country. At the same time, the responsibility system should be implemented, and each grassroots unit must guarantee the completion of the tasks it undertakes. Leaders at all levels must effectively grasp the plan, promptly supervise and inspect, and instruct on the methods to complete the task.

Second, according to the experience and lessons learned from highway construction in the past two years, it has been fully proved that the principle that "construction is impossible without a correct design" is correct. Correct design depends on accurate investigation and research. With a correct design, there will be a realistic plan, and only such a plan can guide our work.

Third, "it is necessary to combine needs with possibilities" and fully estimate one's own strength and objective conditions (such as manpower, technology, material supply, natural conditions, national financial resources, political environment, etc.). Without estimating subjective and objective conditions, blindly accepting tasks will not only make it impossible to complete the task, but also cause losses and disorder in work. Only by fully estimating subjective and objective possibilities can we overcome difficulties and complete the task.

Fourth, before construction, it is necessary to do a good job in construction preparation, improve the construction organization, and correctly allocate various staff (technical, material, financial, design, planning, statistics). A consensus should be reached on the content and requirements of the task, and construction arrangements should be made. The preparation and supply of materials is a very important issue. The material cost of general projects accounts for more than 50% of the total cost. Because the material specifications, transportation, storage, and processing are very complicated, material supply has become a very heavy organizational work, and sufficient preparations must be made. Good preparations must also be made for the organization and distribution of labor, and the possible problems that may occur during construction must be considered.

Fifth, there must be systematic inspection work. In order to implement the plan into practical work and to revise the plan in a timely and correct manner, regular inspections must be carried out. The quality of the project, the layout and organization of the construction should also be inspected, and problems should be discovered and solved in a timely manner. In order to do a good job in inspection, responsible cadres at all levels should plan to go to the site to inspect, and at the same time strengthen statistical work and use statistical reports to conduct inspections.

Sixth, it is necessary to rely on the local government and the masses to complete highway construction tasks and solve problems that highway departments cannot solve alone. For example, mobilizing migrant workers and organizing and educating migrant workers cannot be completely done by highway management agencies alone.

    两年来公路基本建设检查
    中央人民政府交通部
    两年以来，我国公路基本建设获得相当成绩，但还存在着许多严重问题。这是中央交通部公路总局召开的公路基本建设检查工作会议对我国公路建设所作的基本估计。
    缺乏精打细算、周密筹划，浪费国家大量资财。
    公路基本建设工作发生问题的主要原因，在于某些领导干部对基本建设的重要性认识不足，缺乏精打细算、周密筹划的精神，造成基本建设工作中极大的浪费。这种缺点，主要表现在：
    第一、制订计划时，对于技术条件、机械设备、材料来源、组织能力及国家财力等条件，没有周密细心的考虑，只希望多要钱、多修路，标准要高，工程要大，盲目接受任务，但不考虑主观条件。结果不仅任务不能很好完成，而且造成严重的浪费与紊乱现象。例如：东北区一九五○年修建某公路，没有考虑到柏油的来源，就盲目计划修筑柏油路面三十七点四公里，结果因材料限制，只修了三点六公里。西北区去年全年公路投资约四百余亿元，实际只用了二百七十多亿元，呆滞了国家资金一百三十多亿元。
    第二、由于没有设计或者没有经过详细的勘测研究，造成许多设计上的错误；有些设计未经审核批准，就仓促施工。这种现象非常普遍。西北区某座桥梁工程，经过实际调查后做出的设计，与原呈报的初步设计，根本不符。西南区康青路修筑两座桥，未经设计，即盲目地规定了做钢架桥；由重庆做好钢架运到工地后，才发现并不需要修钢架桥，只修木桥就可以。西北区修筑某桥梁，没有钻探，就主观地认为石层很深，确定了设计标准。打桩时打入四公尺就下不去了。没有经过研究，又加重桩铊，继续锤打。还打不下去。这时发觉情况不对，挖开一看，洋灰桩已被打成碎块了。这次损失了二十五万斤米。
    另外，由于准备工作不充分，材料供应不及时，工作组织不严密，没有做好施工的布置，各个部分不能密切配合，也造成了很多损失。
    由于发生了这些错误，给国家造成了很大的损失。根据不完全的统计：一九五○年损失五十六亿六千余万元。一九五一年已经发觉的损失，即有三十三亿三千余万元。其他如设计错误，施工粗糙所造成的返工损失；由于材料供应及运输错误造成的浪费；由于保养不善造成的民工劳动力的浪费，总计起来，将是一个惊人的数字。
    产生浪费的基本原因是什么？
    首先，是由于许多领导干部对基本建设的重要性与严肃性认识不够，缺乏周密筹划的精神，只凭热情和积极性作工作，不从需要与可能出发，不考虑主客观条件，盲目地进行基本建设，致使人民财产遭受重大损失。其次，有些技术人员还存在着雇佣观点，他们还没有把国家的事当作自己的事。还没有很好地建立起全心全意为人民服务的观点和实事求是的作风。因此，加强技术人员的政治思想教育，是一项很重要的任务。
    怎样才能做好公路基本建设
    工作？
    第一、加强基本建设的领导，是做好基本建设工作的最重要的环节。应该教育所有干部和技术人员，要把基本建设工作作为一个政治问题来看待，真正对国家负起责任来。同时，应该贯彻专责制，每一个基层单位对其所负担的任务，必须保证完成。各级领导干部必须切实掌握计划，及时地督促检查，并指示完成任务的方法。
    第二、根据两年来公路建设的经验教训，充分证明了“没有正确的设计就不可能施工”的原则的正确性。正确的设计决定于精确的调查研究。有了正确的设计，才会有切合实际的计划，而只有这样的计划，才可以指导我们的工作。
    第三、“必需要把需要与可能结合起来”，充分估计自己的力量与客观的条件（如人力、技术、材料供应、自然条件、国家财力、政治环境等）。不估计主观客观条件，盲目接受任务，不但不可能完成任务，而且会造成损失与工作上的紊乱。只有充分估计了主观客观的可能性，才能克服困难，完成任务。
    第四、在施工前要做好施工的准备工作，健全施工组织，正确地配备各种工作人员（技术、材料、财务、设计、计划、统计）。对任务的内容与要求，应取得认识上的一致，做好施工布置。材料的准备、供应是个很重要的问题。一般工程的材料费要占全部费用的百分之五十以上，由于材料规格及运输、保管、加工等工作十分复杂，因此，材料供应成为一个很繁重的组织工作，必须作好充分的准备。在劳动力的组织与分配上，也要进行很好的准备，并要考虑到施工中可能发生的问题。
    第五、要有系统地检查工作。为了把计划贯彻到实际工作中去，以及及时、正确地修正计划，就要进行经常的检查。对工程质量，施工的布置与组织，也要进行检查，及时发现问题，加以解决。为了作好检查工作，各级负责干部应有计划地到现场去检查，同时要加强统计工作，通过统计报表来进行检查。
    第六、要依靠地方政府，依靠群众，完成公路修建任务，解决公路部门不能单独解决的问题。如发动民工及民工的组织教育工作，只靠公路管理机关是不能完全作好的。
