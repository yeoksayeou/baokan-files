    Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government
    Overcomes Bureaucracy and Red Tape
    The Northeast People's Government Trade Department's production increase and economy plan stipulates opposition to extravagance and waste, reducing management fees and gasoline costs, and saving on water, electricity, and office expenses. It particularly emphasizes overcoming bureaucracy and red tape, adjusting organizational structures, improving work style and methods, and increasing work efficiency. In the past, some departments within the organization were overstaffed and often sat in their offices drafting official documents, systems, and regulations. Coupled with a lack of close communication, this led to the phenomenon of official documents traveling back and forth, causing many difficulties for work at lower levels. Some comrades reflected: "The upper levels change frequently, the middle levels just forward, and the lower levels have trouble." Others said: "The upper levels have many heads, the middle levels have no head, and the lower levels are dizzy." Now they are striving to overcome this bureaucratic and red-tape style of work. The Trade Department and the Northeast Cooperative Enterprise Committee have adopted a system of joint weekly office meetings and quickly resolved the issue of preferential rates for state-owned trade to cooperatives, greatly reducing the phenomenon of "documents coming and going," which greatly facilitated work at the lower levels. In addition, through the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the awareness level of the staff has improved, and work enthusiasm is high. For example, in November, more than sixty people were transferred to various provinces and cities to inspect work, which not only did not affect the work but also completed the task ahead of schedule. For example, there were originally seven people in charge of expense expenditures. After careful research by three comrades from the Finance and Accounting Department, the forms were unified and merged, and three people could do the work of seven people. For example, in the past, each section had a clerk specifically in charge of receiving and sending documents. This work can be done concurrently by the section members without affecting the work, thus saving dozens of people. In order to strengthen lower-level institutions and develop retail stores, the Northeast People's Government Trade Department has transferred more than twenty people to lower-level institutions of trade departments in various regions. In December, more than one hundred people were proposed from bottom to top who could be transferred.

    东北人民政府贸易部机关
    克服官僚主义文牍主义
    东北人民政府贸易部机关的增产节约计划，规定反对铺张浪费，降低管理费、汽油费，节省水、电、办公费等，特别是着重克服官僚主义、文牍主义，调整组织机构，改进工作作风和工作方法，提高工作效率。过去机关里的某些部门，人浮于事，经常坐在办公室里起草公文、制度、条例，再加彼此的联系很不密切，造成公文旅行现象，使下边工作增加许多困难。有的同志反应：“上层多变，中层照转，下层麻烦。”也有的说：“上层多头多脑，中层无头无脑，下层昏头昏脑。”现在他们正努力克服这种官僚主义和文牍主义作风。贸易部和东北合作事业委员会采取了每周联合办公的制度，并迅速解决了国营贸易对合作社的优待率问题，大大减少了“文来文往”的现象，给下层工作以极大方便。另外，经过反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，工作人员的觉悟水平提高，工作情绪高涨。如十一月份抽调六十多人分赴各省市检查工作，不但没有影响工作，而且提前完成任务。如原来掌管经费开支的有七个人，经财政会计处三个同志仔细研究，把表报统一合并起来，七个人的工作，三个人就能做了。再如过去每科都有一个专管收发文件的文书，这些文书的工作，都可以由科员兼做，并不影响工作，这样可以节省几十个人。为充实下层机构和发展零售店，东北人民政府贸易部已抽调二十多人分配到各地贸易部下层机构去。十二月份由下而上提出能抽调出来的人员有一百多人。
