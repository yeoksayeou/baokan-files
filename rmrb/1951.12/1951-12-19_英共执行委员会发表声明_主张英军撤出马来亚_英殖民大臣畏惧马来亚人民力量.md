Xinhua News Agency, London, December 12th (TASS): The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the situation in Malaya, saying: Despite the British government's use of bombers, armored vehicles, flamethrowers, and methods of destroying entire villages and arresting thousands of innocent women and children in Malaya, all this cannot eliminate the Malayan people's heroic struggle for independence.

The statement cited official reports that Britain had dispatched a large number of aircraft to deal with Malayan patriots. The most powerful British naval force east of Suez is gathering off the coast of Malaya, and British troops have been transferred to Malaya from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Ceylon, Nepal, Borneo, and Africa.

The statement pointed out: British soldiers are being sent thousands of miles away to Malaya to defend the profits of capitalists and a corrupt colonial system, "under which two-thirds of the children are out of school, trade unions are suppressed, and workers' real wages are only one-third of their pre-war minimum living standards."

The statement concluded: "The Malayan National Liberation Army fought against the Japanese occupation forces, and their leaders were cheered at the victory parade in London. Now they are continuing to fight for the same cause - the freedom and independence of Malaya. This cause is in the interests of the British and Malayan people. The entire labor movement and all people who love peace and progress must take a stand to end this terrible war. They must demand the withdrawal of troops from Malaya and the establishment of peaceful and friendly relations with a free Malaya."

Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: British Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton, who arrived in Malaya on November 29th, ended his thirteen-day "inspection tour" on the 11th. Lyttelton was sent by Churchill's instructions to "investigate the reasons why the situation in Malaya is worse than at any time since the start of the 'bandit suppression' war three and a half years ago" (Associated Press). However, Lyttelton discovered that the situation in Malaya was far worse than he knew in London. According to British newspapers, when Lyttelton went to Ipoh in Perak for inspection, he took a fully covered armored car from the airport to the official residence in Ipoh. Fearing the activities of the guerrillas, he had to cancel his plan to inspect a local tin mine. According to the "Daily Telegraph", Lyttelton was escorted by five armored vehicles, two scout cars, and four armored trucks carrying soldiers during his inspection. This embarrassing situation of Lyttelton was mocked by the London "Evening News" before he went to Malaya. The newspaper commented on November 22nd that Lyttelton would have to enter Malaya under the escort of artillery and armored vehicles: "This is of course the case, because the reality is cruel, and without this protection, Mr. Lyttelton would not be able to come out alive."

Before leaving Singapore on the 11th, Lyttelton told reporters that he would use six "main methods" to deal with the Malayan people, the main ones being: sending a supreme commander to unify the command of the British military and police, reorganizing and training the Malayan police, and so on. The British colonialists are clearly attempting to maintain their colonial rule in Malaya with more bloody fascist terror. But Lyttelton could not hide his fear of the Malayan people's armed forces after his "inspection." After listing his six "methods," he went on to say: The urgent action at present is to provide Malaya with more armored vehicles so that British colonial officials, police, rubber plantations, and tin mine agents can also, like himself, "be able to handle affairs under safer protection."

### 英共执行委员会发表声明  主张英军撤出马来亚  英殖民大臣畏惧马来亚人民力量

    英共执行委员会发表声明
    主张英军撤出马来亚
    英殖民大臣畏惧马来亚人民力量
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：英国共产党执行委员会就马来亚局势发表声明说：尽管英国政府在马来亚使用轰炸机、装甲车、喷火器，采取了毁灭整个村庄和逮捕成千成万无辜妇孺的办法，但是这一切都不能消灭马来亚人民争取独立的英勇斗争。
    声明引述官方的报告说，英国派遣了大批飞机去对付马来亚的爱国分子。苏彝士以东英国最强大的海军正集结在马来亚沿海，英国军队已从英国、澳大利亚、新西兰、锡兰、尼泊尔、婆罗洲和非洲调到马来亚去。
    声明指出：英国兵士被派到几千英里以外的马来亚去保卫资本家的利润和腐败的殖民制度，而“在这种殖民制度下，有三分之二的儿童失学，工会遭到压制，工人的实际工资仅及他们战前最低生活水准的三分之一”。
    声明的结语说：“马来亚民族解放军曾和日本占领军作战，他们的领袖们曾在伦敦的胜利游行中受到欢呼，现在正在为了同样的事业——马来亚的自由和独立——而继续作战。这个事业是符合英国人民和马来亚人民的利益的。整个劳工运动和一切爱好和平与进步的人们，必须采取结束这个可怖的战争的态度。他们必须要求军队撤出马来亚，和自由的马来亚建立和平与友好的关系。”
    【新华社十五日讯】十一月二十九日到达马来亚的英国殖民大臣里特尔顿，已在十一日结束了他的历时十三天的“视察旅行”。里特尔顿这次是奉邱吉尔的训令，前往“调查马来亚局势比三年半以前‘剿匪’战争开始以来任何时候更加恶劣的原因的”（合众社）。但是，里特尔顿在马来亚所发现的情况，远较他在伦敦所知道的更为恶劣。据英国报纸报道：里特尔顿在赴霹雳州的怡保巡视时，乘了一辆完全封盖的装甲车由机场开到怡保的官邸。由于畏惧游击队的活动，他不得不取消了视察当地一个锡矿的计划。另据“每日电讯报”报道：里特尔顿在巡视期中，还有五辆装甲车、两辆侦察车和四辆载着士兵的装甲卡车护送。里特尔顿的这种狼狈情景，伦敦“新闻晚报”在他未去马来亚之前，就曾加以嘲讽了。该报在十一月二十二日评论里特尔顿将须在炮车、装甲车的护送下才能进入马来亚时说：“这也是当然的事，因为现实是冷酷的，没有这种保护，里特尔顿先生就不能活着出来了。”
    里特尔顿十一日在离开新加坡之前接见记者时，扬言要用六种“主要办法”来对付马来亚人民，其中主要的是：派遣一个最高司令官统一指挥英国军警、改组并训练马来亚警察等等。英国殖民者显然企图以更血腥的法西斯恐怖统治，来保持他们在马来亚的殖民统治。但是里特尔顿同时也掩饰不住他在“视察”之后，对于马来亚人民武装力量的恐惧。他在列举他的六点“办法”之后，接着就说：目前迫切的行动，是供给马来亚更多的装甲车，好让英国殖民地的官员、警察、橡胶种植园和锡矿的代理人等也可以像他自己那样，“能够在更安全的保护之下办事”。
