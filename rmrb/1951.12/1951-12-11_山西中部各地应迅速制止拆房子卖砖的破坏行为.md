Shanxi Central Areas Should Quickly Stop the Destructive Behavior of Demolishing Houses and Selling Bricks

To the Editor: I propose that everyone pay attention to the phenomenon of demolishing houses and selling bricks, and I suggest that the government quickly prohibit it. On December 7th, I took a train from Taiyuan to Taigu. Along the way at various stations, I saw many old bricks waiting to be transported. I heard that they were to be sold to Taiyuan and other places for construction. Because there have been many construction projects in Taiyuan and other places in the past two years, and the supply of new bricks cannot meet the demand, some people go to the countryside to buy brick houses, temples, ancient tombs, etc., and dismantle them for their old bricks. Many people have made a lot of money from this. From the perspective of the whole society, this phenomenon is a "robbing Peter to pay Paul" approach. Demolishing houses or temples that farmers have been allocated is a serious loss to rural construction. Of course, some of the houses being demolished may already be somewhat damaged (such as temples); even so, these houses can still be used with slight repairs (such as for primary schools, clubs, etc.). Now, if they are demolished, some will have to be rebuilt in the future. Isn't this obvious waste? I think this is absolutely unacceptable. I suggest mobilizing the masses in various counties of Jinzhong to expose this phenomenon in order to stop this destructive behavior.

    山西中部各地应迅速制止拆房子卖砖的破坏行为
    编辑同志：我提议大家注意拆房子卖砖的现象，并建议政府迅速加以禁止。十二月七日，我从太原坐火车到太谷，在沿途各车站上看到很多待运的旧砖，听说是要卖给太原等地作建筑用的。因为两年来太原等地建筑工程很多，新砖供不应求，有些人便到农村中收买砖房、庙宇、古墓等，拆掉后用旧砖；很多人从中赚了很多钱。这种现象，从整个社会来看，是一种“拆东墙垒西墙”的办法，把农民分得的房子或者庙宇等拆掉，对于农村的建筑是一种严重的损失。当然，现在被拆的房子，其中可能有些是已经有些破坏的（如庙宇等）；即使如此，这些房子只要稍加以修补仍是可以使用的（如作小学校、俱乐部等）。现在拆了，有些将来还要再建筑，这不是明摆着的浪费吗？我认为这是绝对不能容许的。我建议发动晋中各县群众检举这种现象，以便制止这种破坏行为。
