Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: According to TASS, the government of the German Democratic Republic has established a committee to draft the All-German National Assembly Election Law, which held its first meeting on November 26th under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht. The meeting set out the guiding principles to be followed in drafting the All-German election law. The Election Law Drafting Committee recommends that the Weimar Election Law promulgated on March 6, 1924, be used as the basis for the All-German election law in order to promote agreement between representatives from East and West Germany at the All-German Conference. The committee recommends that free, universal, secret, equal, and direct elections be held throughout Germany based on a system of proportional representation. The committee believes that the freedom of all citizens to engage in political activities should be guaranteed; that all democratic parties, mass organizations, and groups should enjoy equal freedom in engaging in election activities; that throughout Germany, the people should have the right to freely express their opinions orally, in newspapers, or in any other way; that no one should be arrested or persecuted or discriminated against in their work because of their political views; and that every candidate for the National Assembly should be guaranteed freedom to engage in political activities and personal freedom. The committee also proposed that once this election law is adopted by the All-German Conference, all restrictions on the movement of citizens between the occupied zones and to Berlin should be lifted.

Representatives of various parties and organizations participating in the work of the Election Law Drafting Committee included: Nuschke (Christian Democratic Union), Loch (Free Democratic Party), Bolz (National Democratic Party), Gottenburg (Democratic Farmers' Party), Warnke (Federation of Free German Trade Unions), Onnacker (Free German Youth League), Schmidt (German Democratic Women's Federation), Viwegh (Farmers' Mutual Aid Association), Müller (Social Democratic Party Group of the Greater Berlin City Government), Ulbricht (Socialist Unity Party of Germany), Ebert (Representative of the German Capital Berlin), etc. In their speeches, they unanimously pointed out that the people of all parts of Germany believe that holding All-German elections to restore German unity is the most urgent, existential, and important issue and task at present. They also pointed out that the joint statement issued by Adenauer and the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in Paris regarding the United Nations General Assembly determining "whether free elections can be held simultaneously in the Federal Republic of Germany, Berlin, and the Soviet occupation zone" is contrary to the wishes of the German people. The German people believe that the question to be discussed is not whether to hold All-German elections, but only how representatives from East and West Germany can reach an agreement on the election date and election law at the All-German Conference. The German people demand that All-German elections be held, and not, as stated in the Paris communiqué, "simultaneous elections" in the occupied zones.

The representatives unanimously emphasized that the divided state of Germany is very harmful to the people, so all efforts should be made to restore German unity, and the great opportunity for German unity has arrived.

    德意志民主共和国成立起草全德国民议会选举法委员会
    拟订全德实行自由选举恢复德国统一的指导原则
   【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国政府起草全德国民议会选举法委员会已经组成，并于十一月二十六日在乌布利希副总理的主持下举行了第一次会议。会议定出了关于拟订全德选举法时所将依据的各项指导原则。选举法起草委员会建议以一九二四年三月六日所颁布的魏玛选举法作为全德选举法的基础，以便由此促进德国东部与西部的代表们在全德会议上取得协议；委员会建议，在德国全境根据比例代表制的选举制度，举行自由、普遍、不记名、平等、直接的选举。委员会认为：应该保障全体公民从事政治活动的自由；保障一切民主政党、群众和团体在从事选举活动方面享有同等的自由。在全德各地，人民均得在口头上、报纸上或用任何其他方式自由表示意见的权利；保障无论何人都不得因为政治见解而被逮捕或受到迫害，或在工作上遭到歧视；保障国民议会每一个候选人都有从事政治活动的自由和人身自由。委员会并提出：这个选举法一经全德会议采纳，公民们在各占领区之间迁移和到柏林来的一切限制，都应取消。
    参加选举法起草委员会工作的各党派及团体代表包括：努舍克（基督教民主联盟）、洛赫（自由民主党）、博尔茨（国家民主党）、戈登堡姆（民主农民党）、瓦恩克（自由德国工会联合会）、昂纳克（自由德国青年联盟）、施密特（德国民主妇女联合会）、维威希（农民互助协会）、牟勒（大柏林市政府社会民主党小组）、乌布利希（德国统一社会党）、艾伯特（德国首都柏林代表）等。他们在发言中一致指出，德国各地人民都认为，举行全德选举以恢复德国的统一是当前最迫切的、生存攸关的重大问题和任务。他们也指出，阿登纳和美、英、法三国外长在巴黎所发表的关于联合国大会应确定“是否能在德意志联邦共和国、柏林及苏联占领区内同时举行自由选举”的联合声明，是违反德国人民的意愿的。德国人民认为，要讨论的不是是否举行全德选举的问题，而仅仅是德国东部和西部的代表如何在全德会议上就选举日期和选举法达成协议的问题。德国人民要求举行全德选举，而不是如巴黎公报中所说的，在各占领区内“同时举行选举”。
    代表们一致强调指出：德国的分裂状态对人民非常有害，所以应作一切努力以恢复德国的统一，德国统一的伟大时机已经到来了。
