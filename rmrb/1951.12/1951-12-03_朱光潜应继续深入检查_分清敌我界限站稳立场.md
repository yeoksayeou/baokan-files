    Zhu Guangqian Should Continue to Deepen Self-Criticism
    Distinguish Between the Enemy and Us, and Stand Firm

    To the Editor: From Zhu Guangqian's article "Several Self-Criticisms in Recent Study," it seems he has made some progress in this teacher study movement. However, I think Zhu Guangqian's self-criticism is not deep enough, and he has not fully exposed and criticized his past erroneous thoughts. Although he used many words such as "supra-class" and "supra-political," he said very little about his past reactionary words and actions. He only abstractly said, "I stood on the side of the reactionaries and served the reactionaries."

    Zhu Guangqian mentioned that he had "served as a member of the puppet Central Committee," "attended Chiang Kai-shek's banquet," "joined the Kuomintang," and "received training at the 'Central Training Corps'." From this, it seems that Zhu Guangqian did promote that reactionary machine, and the reactionary role he played was not small. I hope that Zhu Guangqian will further examine his past, otherwise, how can he distinguish between the enemy and us and stand firm in the future? Zhao Ruizhi

### 朱光潜应继续深入检查  分清敌我界限站稳立场

    朱光潜应继续深入检查
    分清敌我界限站稳立场
    编辑同志：从朱光潜“最近学习中几点检讨”一文看来，他在这次教师学习运动中有了一些进步。但是我觉得朱光潜的检讨是不够深刻的，他还没有把过去的错误思想完全暴露出来，并作批判。他虽用了不少“超阶级”、“超政治”等字眼，但对于他过去的反动的言论和行动，却说得很少。他只是抽象地说“我站上了反动派的立场，替反动派服务”。
    朱光潜曾提到他过去“任过伪中央委员”，“赴过蒋介石的宴会”，“加入了国民党”，“调到‘中央训练团’受过训”。从这里看来，朱光潜确曾推动过那座反动机器，而且他所起的反动作用并不很小。希望朱光潜对自己的过去进行进一步的检查，否则，他今后怎么能分清敌我，站稳立场呢？                        赵瑞芝
