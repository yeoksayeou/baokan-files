Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 2nd: Since November 24th of last year, there have been fourteen groups of overseas Chinese from Malaya, a total of 9,052 people, who have been unreasonably expelled by British imperialists and returned to their motherland in the past year.

These displaced overseas Chinese were all unreasonably detained in concentration camps and then deported after the British colonial government of Malaya announced the so-called "Emergency Ordinance" in June 1948. According to incomplete statistics, the losses suffered by the displaced overseas Chinese in their places of residence due to the burning and looting of houses, fields, and property amounted to more than 4.9 million Straits dollars (equivalent to more than 36 billion RMB). Many overseas Chinese were also injured, sick, or disabled due to torture and abuse.

After the displaced overseas Chinese returned to their motherland, they received care and proper resettlement from overseas Chinese affairs agencies and people's governments at all levels. More than 5,000 people have been subsidized to return to their hometowns for production; some have returned to areas undergoing land reform and have been allocated land; more than 2,300 people have been introduced to work in state-owned factories, government agencies, or to study in schools; and some are being helped by overseas Chinese affairs agencies to build farms for production. Some elderly, weak, disabled, and unable to work have been placed in relief centers, and the injured and sick have received treatment. The Committee for Handling Returned Displaced Overseas Chinese has paid a total of more than 210 million yuan in medical expenses for the treatment of the injured and sick displaced overseas Chinese in the past year. Zeng Guilian, a female overseas Chinese who was shot six times by British troops and then brutally tortured, has recovered and returned to work after long-term medical treatment. The properly resettled displaced overseas Chinese have sent letters to overseas Chinese affairs agencies, expressing their heartfelt gratitude to the People's Government.

In the past year, the British colonial government of Malaya, ignoring the solemn protests of the Chinese people, has continued to persecute overseas Chinese. On the one hand, they have expelled nearly 10,000 overseas Chinese, and on the other hand, they have continued to arrest overseas Chinese and imprison them in concentration camps. According to news from Singapore, there are still more than 20,000 overseas Chinese imprisoned in concentration camps, suffering barbaric treatment. The British colonial government has also forced more than 400,000 overseas Chinese to move into so-called "immigration camps," while burning and looting their houses and property. The British imperialists must bear all the consequences and responsibilities for their consistent reactionary behavior of persecuting overseas Chinese and infringing upon their legitimate rights and interests.

### 马来亚华侨被无理驱逐  一年来近万人返国  返国后受到政府妥善安置

    马来亚华侨被无理驱逐
    一年来近万人返国
    返国后受到政府妥善安置
    【新华社广州二日电】自去年十一月二十四日开始，一年来被英帝国主义者整批无理驱逐出境、回到祖国的马来亚华侨已有十四批，共九千零五十二人。
    这些难侨都是在一九四八年六月马来亚英国殖民政府宣布所谓“紧急法令”以后，先被无理拘禁在集中营里而后又被驱逐出境的。据不完全统计：难侨们在居留地的房屋、田园、财物遭到烧毁、劫夺的损失达四百九十万元叻币（折人民币三百六十余亿元）以上。很多华侨还因受到酷刑和虐待以致伤病或残废。
    难侨们返抵祖国后，都得到侨务机关和各级人民政府的关怀和妥当安置，其中有五千余人已资送回乡生产；一部分回到正在进行土地改革的地区，并已分得了土地；有二千三百多人被介绍到公营工厂、政府机关里工作，或进学校学习；还有一部分人正由侨务机关筹建农场让他们进行生产；一些老弱残废不能劳动的，被安置在救济处所；伤病者都得到了治疗。归国难侨处理委员会在一年内，为治疗难侨的伤病所支付的医药费共达二亿一千多万元。曾被英军枪击六弹后又惨受酷刑的女侨胞曾桂莲，经长期医疗后，已痊愈参加工作。获得妥善安置的难侨们纷纷寄信给侨务机关，对人民政府表示衷心的感激。
    一年来，马来亚英国殖民政府不顾我国人民的严正抗议，依然继续对华侨进行迫害。他们一面驱逐近万的华侨出境，一面又不断地拘捕华侨关进集中营。据新加坡消息：现在被囚禁在集中营里受着野蛮待遇的华侨仍在二万人以上。英国殖民政府还强迫四十余万华侨搬进所谓“移民营”里，同时焚烧和洗劫他们的房屋和财产。英帝国主义者对于他们这种一贯迫害华侨和侵犯华侨正当权益的反动行为，必须担负一切后果和责任。
