    Adjusting Electricity Load is a Major Task in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Adjusting electricity load is a major task in the increase production and practice economy campaign. Adjusting electricity load can greatly unleash the potential capacity of the electricity industry, ensuring increased electricity consumption for industrial and mining enterprises, and can also reduce and eliminate electricity waste. According to the Northeast Daily, there are still very unreasonable phenomena in the supply and use of electricity in industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast region. The most prominent is that the electricity load has not been adjusted as it should be. For example, electricity consumption for industrial and mining is often squeezed into the same time period as urban lighting; and the electricity consumption of machines that do not necessarily need to run continuously has not been rationally adjusted. As a result, the electricity load rises sharply between 17:00 and 21:00 every day, inappropriately occupying a large amount of electricity; while some electricity users who need to use electricity during this time feel that there is not enough electricity. This hinders the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, reduces standby power, and makes it impossible to guarantee the safety of power supply, causing many direct and indirect losses to the country. Therefore, a comprehensive adjustment of the load is very necessary. This measure has not only significant economic value, but also important political significance.
    Adjusting electricity load requires joint efforts from the electricity sector and industrial and mining enterprises. The electricity sector should strictly practice economy, tap potential, make various possible adjustments, and promptly propose requirements and suggestions for adjusting the load to industrial and mining users. Industrial and mining users should take the initiative to make adjustments, instead of passively waiting. Only when the responsible cadres of industrial and mining enterprises have broadened their thinking and consciously make adjustments can timely and maximum results be achieved. As long as everyone fully understands the significance of adjusting electricity load and its great role in national economic construction, then the task of adjusting the load can be successfully completed.

    调整电力负荷是增产节约运动中一件大事
    调整电力负荷，是增产节约运动中的一件大事。调整电力负荷，可以大大发挥电业中的潜在能力，保证工矿企业增产用电；而且可以减少并消灭电力的浪费现象。据东北日报载：东北地区工矿企业在电力的供应与使用上，还存在着很不合理的现象。最突出的是用电负荷没有得到应有的调整。例如工矿用电常与城市照明用电挤在同一时间里；非必须连续运转的机器用电，也没有合理的调整。结果，每天十七点到二十一点间的用电负荷突出上涨，不适当地占用着大量的电力；而某些必需于这一时间用电的用电户，则感到电力不够。这就妨碍了增产节约运动的发展，减少了备用电力，并使供电不能保证安全，给国家造成许多直接、间接的损失。因此，全面调整负荷是十分必要的。这一措施不但有重大的经济价值，而且有重要的政治意义。
    调整电力负荷，需要电业部门和工矿企业共同努力。电业部门应当厉行节约，发挥潜力，进行各种可能的调整，并应及时地向工矿用户提出调整负荷的要求与意见。各工矿用户则应主动地进行调整，不要消极地等待。只有工矿负责干部打通了思想，自觉地进行调整，才能收到及时的和最大的效果。而只要大家充分理解了调整电力负荷的意义及其对国家经济建设的重大作用，那末，调整负荷这一任务是可以胜利完成的。
