The Chinese national bourgeoisie, under the call of the united front, has universally raised its understanding, realizing that it is a revolutionary class, that it has certain economic interests and certain historical tasks in the new democratic construction. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the national bourgeoisie has further transformed its past dependence on imperialism, and has also participated in the anti-imperialist struggle in revolutionary practice. This is the ideological transformation process of the Chinese national bourgeoisie.

This transformation process, apart from a few people with a theoretical foundation, may have been decisively influenced by the "in itself" factors of consciousness: First, the great victory of the People's Liberation War drove the reactionary rule and the forces of imperialism out of the Chinese mainland, cutting off economic ties with the imperialists. Second, the vigorous leadership of the people's regime, the basic improvement of finance and economy, and the universal stability of prices have reduced the blind, speculative pursuit of profiteering. Third, the planned leadership of the national economy and the rational adjustment of industry and commerce have made it necessary for individuals to submit to the whole. Fourth, the implementation of land reform thoroughly destroyed the feudal forces, liberated the rural productive forces, and created favorable conditions for the development of production. Fifth, the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries eradicated the remaining forces of Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. The sixth factor is the most important, that is, the Chinese People's Volunteers' expedition to Korea defeated the world's most powerful imperialist American imperialist army, began to eliminate pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American psychology, recognized the corruption and decline of capitalism, and thus established an independent, self-reliant, and prosperous economic confidence. These ideological influences, once combined with practice, become a strong material force.

The liberation movement of oppressed nations has a dual significance of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is the most concrete and acute manifestation of the combination of internationalism and patriotism in the anti-imperialist struggle. This movement has formed an unprecedented great unity of all classes and strata of the country, and further consolidated the people's democratic regime. The national bourgeoisie has suffered from imperialist oppression for more than a hundred years, and has its own revolutionary side; however, due to the economic ties with imperialism in the past, it also has a wavering, weak, and compromising side. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has stood up, cut off its dependence on imperialism, and firmly stood on the post of anti-imperialist struggle. First, it is rare for the national bourgeoisie to organize demonstration marches alone; in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, demonstration marches organized by the national industrial and commercial circles alone, like a rising wind and surging clouds. Second, industrial and commercial people across the country universally sign patriotic covenants, and turn the work of inspecting these covenants into a regular and profound practice. Third, the widespread development of preferential treatment work, industrial and commercial people across the country, according to the specific circumstances of various industries, formulate various preferential treatment methods for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, as well as the wounded, such as holding condolences and parties, introducing jobs, subsidizing children's schooling, reducing and exempting rent, medical expenses, and transportation costs, etc., so that the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and the wounded, have solved part of the difficulties in life, and encouraged the morale of the front. Fourth, industrial and commercial people have made great efforts in comforting Korean soldiers, such as material comforts, book comforts, letter comforts, etc.; the industrial and commercial circles have also sent representatives to the front to express that the industrial and commercial circles have united with the soldiers on the anti-imperialist front to fight together. Fifth, industrial and commercial people universally sign to support the Five-Power Peace Pact and participate in the vote against the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism, indicating that the anti-imperialism and love of peace of the industrial and commercial circles are consistent with the demands of the peace-loving people of the world. Sixth, regarding supporting financial tasks, industrial and commercial circles never owe taxes, do not leak taxes, and do not evade taxes, and further achieve collective tax payment and advance tax payment. Seventh, regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, industrial and commercial people abandoned their sentimentalism and promoted the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements. Eighth, regarding the donation of airplanes and artillery, industrial and commercial circles contributed their strength, and their donation figures may account for a very large proportion of 80% of the total national donation. Ninth, in order to continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, the industrial and commercial circles know to rely on the working class, do a good job in labor-capital relations, increase production, and practice strict economy, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and enhance the strength of national economic construction. From these factual manifestations, it can be proved that the national bourgeoisie has transformed from the inferiority complex of the colony into a national thought of self-esteem and self-respect, and with practical actions, loves the motherland and loves peace; at the same time, in the practice of anti-imperialist struggle, it recognizes that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, and the peace and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world are our closest friends.

The struggle to resist America and aid Korea has basically achieved a great victory; however, the imperialists headed by American imperialism are by no means willing to die, and their desperate struggle to endanger China's security and the peace of Asia and the world is completely imaginable. Therefore, the Chinese people must never be satisfied with the victory they have achieved, and relax the anti-imperialist struggle; on the contrary, we must make persistent efforts to carry on the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea "until the US government is willing to resolve it peacefully." (Chairman Mao's words) In order to defend the security of the motherland and strive for lasting world peace, all the Chinese people must resolutely implement the three movements decided by the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, launch a patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy, and widely launch a movement for ideological remoulding.

Ideology is the guide to action. Without correct ideology, there will be no correct action. Taking the Chinese revolution as an example, without the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, it would be impossible to achieve victory. Taking the national bourgeoisie's participation in the revolutionary struggle as an example, without the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, it would be impossible to become a revolutionary class; although it is a reflection of objective things, such as the growth of peaceful and democratic forces, the corruption and decline of imperialism, etc., it may affect its ideology, but this kind of "in itself" consciousness is extremely limited: for example, understanding labor-capital relations from a one-sided economic point of view makes it impossible to correctly establish the idea of relying on the working class, and it is impossible to do a good job in production, save waste, and increase the wealth of the people; for example, observing the Korean War from the perspective of individualism, letting others fight and others bleed, makes it impossible to establish the idea of patriotism, and it is impossible to participate in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. We must transform what we hear, see, and talk about into our own concrete ideas, and turn them into correct propositions for observing and handling problems through political study and current affairs study. This is what social science calls the development from "in itself" consciousness to "for itself" consciousness. Therefore, in the eyes of the national bourgeoisie, the issue of ideological remoulding is a central link in the Resist America, Aid Korea, and increase production and practice economy movement.

In order to launch the three movements decided by the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and to complete the historical task of developing production and prospering the economy in the new democratic period, it is extremely important for the national bourgeoisie to conduct learning with leadership, organization, and planning. The Shanghai national bourgeoisie's learning takes the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce as the leading core, the industry associations of various industries as the auxiliary leading institutions, and the grass-roots organizations of the industry associations of various industries as the driving force. Its learning materials combine current affairs, politics, economics and other materials, and are uniformly issued by the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Its learning methods include thematic lectures, report transmissions, group discussions, and learning summaries of each unit. Now some industries have begun to study the Outline of New Democratic Economics, and a few industries have begun to systematically study Marxism-Leninism - the theory of class struggle, the materialistic dialectical philosophy, and political economy. Shanghai is an economic base where imperialism has invaded China for more than a hundred years. The Shanghai national bourgeoisie had relatively close economic ties with imperialism in the past. Once it gets rid of the influence of imperialism and vigorously promotes the spirit of patriotism, it is entirely due to passing through learning, and not accidental. Therefore, we must also emphasize: the national bourgeoisie must arm itself with Mao Zedong Thought, strive to victoriously implement the three major movements decided by the CPPCC, consolidate the ideological foundation, and strive to complete the new democratic construction.

    民族资产阶级的思想转变过程
    陈巳生
    中国民族资产阶级在统一战线的号召之下，普遍地提高了认识，了解他自身是个革命的阶级，在新民主主义建设中，有他一定的经济利益，也有他一定的历史任务。自从抗美援朝运动展开以后，民族资产阶级更转变了过去依赖帝国主义的思想，在革命的实践中，也参加了反帝的斗争。——这是中国民族资产阶级的思想转变过程。
    这一个转变过程，除了一部分人具有理论基础以外，其“自在”的觉悟因素，可能是起了决定作用：一是由于人民解放战争的伟大胜利，将反动统治和帝国主义的势力逐出了中国大陆，遮断了与帝国主义者经济上的联系。二是由人民政权的大力领导，财政经济的基本好转，物价普遍的稳定，减少了盲目性、投机性的追求暴利思想。三是由于国家经济有计划的领导，对工商业作合理的调整，使个体必须服从于整体。四是由于土地改革的实施，封建势力被彻底的摧毁，农村生产力得到了解放，创造了发展生产的有利条件。五是由于大张旗鼓的镇压反革命，铲除了蒋匪、美帝国主义的残存势力。第六项因素是最重要的，即由于中国人民志愿军出师朝鲜，打败了世界上最强大的帝国主义的美帝国主义军队，开始肃清了亲美、崇美、恐美心理，认
    定资本主义的腐朽没落，从而建立了独立自主、繁
    荣经济的信心。这些思想影响，一经结合了实践，就变成了坚强的物质力量。
    被压迫民族的解放运动，具有反帝、反封建的两重意义。抗美援朝运动是结合了国际主义、爱国主义在反帝斗争中最具体、最尖锐的表现。这一个运动，形成了全国各阶级、各阶层空前的大团结，更巩固了人民民主政权。民族资产阶级在百余年来遭受到帝国主义的压迫，是有切肤之痛的，因此自有其革命性的一面；但是由于过去和帝国主义经济上的联系关系，也有其动摇、软弱、妥协的一面。抗美援朝运动展开以后，中国民族资产阶级站起来了，割断了对帝国主义的依存关系，坚定地站在反帝斗争的岗位。第一，民族资产阶级自己单独组织示威大游行的队伍，是罕有先例的；而在抗美援朝的运动中，全国工商界自己单独组织的示威大游行，如风起云涌。第二，全国工商业者普遍地签订爱国公约，并且把检查这一公约的工作，变为经常化与深刻化。第三，优抚工作的普遍展开，全国各地的工商业者按照各行各业的具体情况，对烈属军属以及伤员，订出各种不同的优抚办法，如举行慰问、联欢，介绍职业，补助子女入学，减免房租、医疗费、车船乘费等等，使烈军属、伤员，解决了生活上部分的困难，而鼓励了前方的士气。第四，慰劳朝鲜战士，如物品慰劳、书籍慰劳、书信慰劳等等，工商业者都尽了很大的努力；工商界并推派代表，亲往战地慰问，表示在反帝战线上，工商界已与战士们团结在一起，共同奋斗。第五，工商业者普遍地签名拥护五大国和平公约，并参加反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的投票，表示工商界的反帝与爱好和平，和全世界爱好和平人民的要求是一致的。第六，关于支持财经任务，工商界从不欠税、不漏税、不逃税，进一步做到集体缴税和提前缴税。第七，关于镇压反革命运动，工商业者抛弃了温情主义，推动了镇压反革命运动。第八，关于捐献飞机大炮，工商界贡献了自己的力量，其捐献数字，可能占全国捐献总额百分之八十的极大比重。第九，为了继续加强抗美援朝的工作，工商界知道依靠工人阶级，搞好劳资关系，增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，并增强国家经济建设的力量。从这些事实的表现，都可以证明民族资产阶级从殖民地的自卑心理，转变而成为自尊自重的民族思想，以实际的行动，热爱祖国，热爱和平；同时在反帝斗争的实践中，认清美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，而以苏联为首的和平民主国家以及世界上爱好和平的人民，是我们最亲切的朋友。
    抗美援朝的斗争，基本上已获得了伟大的胜利；但是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者，决不甘心死亡，其绝望的挣扎，企图危害中国的安全及亚洲与世界的和平，是完全可以想像的。因此中国人民，绝对不能满足已得的胜利，而松懈了反帝的斗争；相反地，我们必须再接再厉地把抗美援朝的伟大斗争，“继续进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止。”（毛主席语）为了保卫祖国的安全，争取世界持久的和平，全中国人民，必须坚决实现人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议所决定的三项运动：继续加强抗美援朝运动，展开爱国增产节约运动，广泛展开思想改造运动。
    思想是行动的指导，没有正确的思想，就不会有正确的行动。以中国革命来说，没有马列主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的领导，不可能得到胜利。以民族资产阶级参加革命斗争来讲，没有毛泽东思想的领导，不可能成为一个革命的阶级；虽是客观事物的反映，如和平民主力量的壮大、帝国主义的腐朽没落等等，可能影响他的思想意识，但是这种“自在”的觉悟，是极有其限度的：例如从单方面的经济观点来了解劳资关系，就不可能正确地建立依靠工人阶级的思想，也就不可能搞好生产，节约浪费，来增加人民的财富；又如从个人主义出发来观察朝鲜战争，打仗要别人去打，流血要别人去流，就不可能建立爱国主义的思想，也就不可能参加抗美援朝的斗争。我们必须通过政治学习、时事学习，才可能把听到的、看到的以及谈到的东西，变成为自己的具体思想，变成观察与处理问题的正确主张，这就是社会科学所说的，由“自在”的觉悟，发展为“自为”的觉悟。所以思想改造问题，在民族资产阶级看来，是在抗美援朝、增产节约运动中，是个中心环节。
    民族资产阶级为了展开人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议所决定的三项运动，并为完成新民主主义时期发展生产、繁荣经济的历史任务，有领导、有组织、有计划地进行学习，是极重要的了。上海民族资产阶级的学习，以上海市工商业联合会为领导核心，以各业的同业公会为领导的辅助机构，以各业同业公会的基层组织为推动力量。其学习资料，结合了时事、政治、经济等各种材料，由工商联统一印发。其学习方法，采取专题讲演、传达报告、小组讨论及各单元的学习总结。现在已有若干行业，已经开始学习新民主主义经济概论，也有少数行业，开始有系统地学习马列主义——阶级斗争学说、唯物辩证哲学、政治经济学了。上海是帝国主义百余年来侵略中国的经济基地，上海民族资产阶级过去和帝国主义经济上的联系，比较的密切，一旦摆脱了帝国主义的影响，蓬勃地发扬爱国主义的精神，这是完全由于通过了学习，而不是偶然的了。所以我们还必须强调地说：民族资产阶级必须用毛泽东思想武装起来，为胜利地执行政协所决定的三大运动，为巩固思想基础，为完成新民主主义建设而奋斗。
