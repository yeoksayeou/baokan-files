    Shanxi Construction Company Employees
    Expose Numerous Cases of Tied-up Funds
    Comrade Editor: In this asset inventory and capital verification work at the Shanxi Construction Company, because the employees understood the importance of this work beforehand, everyone was actively responsible and exposed many cases of tied-up funds. For example: Last year, the Shanxi Construction Company bought a large quantity of short steel bars, which have not been used for a year, tying up a lot of funds. The cement purchased by the company last year still has more than 171,000 kilograms in storage, tying up funds of 150 million yuan. The company's lumber mill has tied up 2,400 sheets of plywood bought last year, worth more than 100 million yuan. The company's brickyard produced a large number of bricks this spring, but because the company wanted to sell them at a high price, they were not sold in time. Therefore, they still cannot be sold, tying up more than 20 million bricks, worth 7-8 million jin of millet. After exposing these phenomena, the employees further realized the seriousness of the waste caused by tied-up funds. The workers in the repair department said, "We didn't know that so much capital was tied up before. In the future, we must pay more attention to our possessions." Now, everyone has unanimously expressed that they will assist the administrative side to thoroughly do a good job in asset inventory and capital verification, and lay a solid foundation for the people's enterprises to implement economic accounting.

    山西省建筑公司职工
    揭发了许多积压资金的事实
    编辑同志：山西省建筑公司在这次清理资产核定资金工作中，由于职工们在事前了解了这个工作的重要性，大家积极负责，揭发了很多积压资金的事实。例如：去年山西省建筑公司买下大量短钢筋，一年来都没有用过，积压了很多资金。公司在去年买的洋灰，到现在还存着十七万一千多公斤，积压资金一亿五千多万元。公司所属的木材厂积压了去年买的二千四百块三合板，价值一亿多元。公司的窑厂在今年春天生产了大批的砖，因公司方面想卖大价钱，没有及时出售，因此，直到现在还卖不出去，共积压二千多万块砖，价值七、八百万斤小米。揭露了这些现象后，职工们进一步体会到积压资金造成的浪费的严重性。修理部的工人说：“以前我们不知道积压了这么大的资金，今后我们可要多多注意我们的家当。”现在，大家一致表示要协助行政方面，彻底做好清理资产核定资金的工作，给人民的企业打好实行经济核算制的基础。
