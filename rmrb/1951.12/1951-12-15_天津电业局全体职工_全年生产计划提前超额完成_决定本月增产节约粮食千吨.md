Decide to increase production and save 1,000 tons of grain this month

The entire staff of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau, responding to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," has decided to increase production and save 1,000 tons of millet for the country in December. They have already formulated specific plans for increasing production and saving, and decided to start from tapping the potential of existing equipment to improve equipment utilization, opening up power to adjust loads, reducing various consumptions, strengthening maintenance and inspection, doing a good job in clearing assets and verifying capital, and accelerating capital turnover, in order to complete the plan of increasing production and saving. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Electric Power Trade Union will continue to conduct in-depth patriotic education and safety education among employees; mobilize the masses to check and revise patriotic covenants, and incorporate the plan of increasing production and saving into the patriotic covenants; mobilize the masses to extensively check, report, and eliminate waste; actively promote advanced experiences to ensure the smooth completion of the plan of increasing production and saving, and lay the foundation for next year's increase production and save movement. They have already challenged the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau with the goal of increasing production and saving 1,000 tons of grain in one month.

The Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's 1951 production task was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target on December 1st, increasing the value of excess profits for the country by 4,287 tons of millet. The plan to increase production and save "three airplanes and one cannon" in the second half of this year has also been completed ahead of schedule at the end of November. Now, all employees of the bureau are continuing to exert their patriotic labor enthusiasm to complete the new plan of increasing production and saving.

    天津电业局全体职工
    全年生产计划提前超额完成
    决定本月增产节约粮食千吨
    天津电业局全体职工响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，决定十二月份为国家增产节约一千吨小米。他们已经订出具体的增产节约计划，决定在现有的设备条件下，从发挥设备潜在能力提高设备利用率、开放电力调整负荷、降低各项消耗、加强检修检查、作好清理资产核定资金工作、加速资金流转等方面，着手完成增产节约计划。电业工会天津市委员会将在职工中继续进行深入的爱国主义教育和安全教育；发动群众检查修订爱国公约，把增产节约计划订到爱国公约中去；发动群众广泛地检查、检举并消灭浪费现象；积极地推广先进经验，以保证增产节约计划顺利完成，并为明年的增产节约运动打下基础。他们已经以一个月中增产节约一千吨粮食向唐山电业局应战。
    天津电业局一九五一年的生产任务已经提前一个月在十二月一日超额完成，为国家增加超额利润价值四千二百八十七吨小米。今年下半年增产节约“三架飞机一门大炮”的计划也已经在十一月底提前完成。现在全局职工正继续发挥爱国主义劳动热情，为完成新的增产节约计划而努力。
