Strengthen Cotton and Grain Procurement Work

    Central South District State-Owned Textile Company Exceeds Cotton Purchase Plan for the Past Two Months
    The Central South District Company of the China National Textile Corporation has achieved great success in its cotton purchase and transportation work in October and November, and has been commended by both the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the head office of the China National Textile Corporation. The amount of cotton purchased in the Central South District in October and November exceeded the original plan by 24 percent. By the end of November, the district had completed 93 percent of its new cotton purchase task for the four months from September to December. From September to November, the amount of cotton transferred from the Central South District to East China exceeded the original plan by 148,700 dan; the amount of cotton transferred to Southwest China exceeded the original plan by 12,300 dan.
    Over the past two months, the Central South District has paid attention to strengthening the management of the cotton market, vigorously supplying materials to cotton-producing areas, and continuing to conduct patriotic education among cotton farmers, which are the main reasons for this achievement. In early October, some areas in the Central South District experienced two deviations in the management of the cotton market: laissez-faire and compulsory management. In addition, the cotton procurement work was affected in some cotton-producing areas such as Shanzhou in Henan, Tianmen in Hubei, and Lixian in Hunan due to the untimely supply of materials. After discovering this situation, the state-owned textile companies in various parts of the Central South District immediately cooperated with the local industrial and commercial administration departments and other state-owned trading companies to strengthen market management and material supply, which quickly resulted in great achievements in cotton procurement. For example, most cotton-producing areas in Henan Province organized cotton exchanges and cotton purchase committees. State-owned and private units purchased cotton under the unified supply or purchase on behalf of the textile company, or the industrial and commercial administration departments issued cotton purchase certificates for self-purchase in designated areas, which changed the once chaotic situation in the cotton market. In October, various state-owned trading companies in cotton-producing areas such as Shashi and Shadaoguan in Hubei Province transferred large quantities of grain, salt, cloth, kerosene, soap, and handicraft products from various places to supply cotton farmers. The supply of the textile company in Shashi alone was five times larger than before. In the cotton-producing area of Shanzhou, Henan Province, the textile company supplied cloth in October that was equivalent to 180 percent of the third quarter, and the department store also supplied goods that were equivalent to 160 percent of September. In order to ensure the stability of cotton prices throughout the district and the needs of farmers in non-cotton-producing areas for wadding cotton, the textile companies in various places supplied more than 59,000 dan of wadding cotton in October and November. After the full supply of materials, the amount of cotton on the market quickly increased. The Shadaoguan branch of the Hubei Textile Company purchased more than twice the original plan in October. Since the large-scale supply of wadding cotton in various parts of Henan in late October, the cotton quotation and market price were roughly close, and the cotton purchase task for the four months from September to December was completed in November. At the same time, the people's governments in some cotton-producing areas in Hubei and Henan paid attention to conducting patriotic education among cotton farmers, so the cotton farmers were very enthusiastic about selling cotton, which further guaranteed the rapid completion of the cotton purchase tasks of the state-owned textile companies in various places. For example, many districts and townships in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, successively held farmer representative meetings and cotton farmer symposiums, and the county magistrate of Fangcheng County People's Government personally went to the countryside to inspect and supervise the cotton purchase work. As a result, the daily purchase volume in the entire prefecture in late October increased by about five times compared to early October. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Cooperatives in East China
    Complete Annual Cotton Purchase Task Ahead of Schedule
    Cooperatives in East China have overfulfilled this year's task of purchasing new cotton one month ahead of schedule. From late September to December 5, the amount of cotton purchased and stored in the entire region exceeded the original plan by 13 percent. At present, cooperatives in East China are continuing to purchase cotton.
    Since the listing of new cotton this year, cotton farmers in East China have continuously carried out patriotic collective cotton sales movements, and the cotton collection work in the entire region has exceeded the original plan every month. In the second half of October, cotton farmers in the entire region began to repay the loans of rice and fertilizer that the cooperatives had lent them in the spring of this year. According to incomplete statistics as of December 5, except for the cotton areas in northern Jiangsu and a few farmers in other areas who were more severely affected by disasters, the cotton farmers have all repaid the loans of rice and fertilizer that the cooperatives had lent them. Cotton farmers in various places also stored the cotton that they did not need to exchange for money in the cooperatives. Cotton farmers in Shandong, southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, and the suburbs of Shanghai alone have stored more than 25.8 million catties of ginned cotton in the cooperatives. Since November, cooperatives in various places have begun to use the method of trust deposits to help state-owned textile companies reduce cash investment.
    Cooperatives in East China supplied a large number of daily necessities to cotton farmers during the purchase of new cotton, which further increased the prestige of cooperatives in rural areas. Since the Guangrao County Cooperative in Shandong Province carried out the cotton purchase work, more than 2,800 cotton farmers have applied to join the cooperative. Cotton farmers in the new cotton producing areas of the county have also asked the government to help them build cooperatives.
    At present, cooperatives in East China are generally carrying out real deposit business, mobilizing members to deposit cotton in cooperatives to pre-purchase New Year's goods and fertilizers, and strive to purchase more cotton. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Grain Companies and Cooperatives in North China
    Overfulfill Grain Purchase Task in the Past Two Months
    State-owned grain companies and cooperatives in North China overfulfilled the grain purchase plan in October and November. The total amount of grain purchased in October exceeded the purchase plan by 30.45 percent, and the total amount of grain purchased in November exceeded the plan by 25.52 percent.
    The emphasis of the people's governments and state-owned grain companies at all levels in North China on grain purchase work is one of the main reasons for the overfulfillment of this autumn's grain purchase plan. In addition to setting up fixed grain collection stations in cities and towns, grain companies in various places have also formed many grain collection teams with cooperatives in various places to go deep into the countryside to collect grain. The acquisition team organized by Yuci Prefecture in Shanxi Province had 160 people. The implementation of key acquisitions in various places has made the acquisition work progress faster than in previous years and kept grain prices stable in grain-producing areas. At the same time, due to the implementation of the policy of grading and pricing grain in the acquisition, the quality of grain acquired by state-owned grain companies and cooperatives this year is also better than in previous years.

    Puer Prefecture Minority Areas
    Trading Companies Actively Purchase New Cotton
    New cotton has been successively listed in the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as Yunyi (Thai), Kawa, and Luohei. The local state-owned trading companies are actively purchasing it, and at the same time, they are supplying large quantities of edible salt urgently needed by various ethnic groups.
    Cheli, Fohai, Nanqiao, and Lancang counties under the jurisdiction of Puer Prefecture are one of the cotton-producing areas in Yunnan Province. Before liberation, due to transportation difficulties, the cotton produced by the people of all ethnic groups had no sales channels, and the cotton price was low, resulting in a large number of cotton fields being deserted or converted to opium cultivation. After liberation, the people's government encouraged farmers of all ethnic groups to grow cotton and provided cotton seeds, agricultural tools, etc., which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in the area. According to preliminary estimates, the cotton produced by ethnic minorities in Puer Prefecture this year has increased by more than 100,000 jin. The state-owned trading company in the prefecture has stipulated a reasonable ratio of cotton to edible salt in order to take care of the shortage of edible salt in the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. The people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture are now enthusiastically selling new cotton to the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中南区国营花纱布公司上两月超额完成购棉计划

专栏：加强棉粮收购工作

    中南区国营花纱布公司上两月超额完成购棉计划
    中国花纱布公司中南区公司十、十一月份收购和调运棉花工作成绩很大，先后受到中央人民政府贸易部和中国花纱布公司总公司的表扬。中南区十、十一两月收购棉花数量超过原计划百分之二十四。到十一月底止，全区已完成九月到十二月四个月的新棉收购任务百分之九十三。九月到十一月中南区调往华东区的棉花超过原计划十四万八千七百担；调往西南区的棉花超过原计划一万二千三百担。
    两个月来，中南区各地收购棉花时，注意了加强棉花市场管理、大力供应产棉区物资和继续对棉农进行爱国主义教育，这是做出这个成绩的主要原因。十月初，中南区部分地区对棉花市场的管理曾发生放任自流和强制管理两种偏向，加上河南陕州、湖北天门、湖南澧县等部分产棉区一度因物资供应不及时，影响了购棉工作。中南区各地国营花纱布公司发现这个情况后，立即配合当地工商行政部门和其他国营贸易公司，加强市场管理和物资供应工作，使购棉工作很快做出极大的成绩。如河南省大部分产棉区都组织了棉花交易所和购棉委员会，公私单位收购棉花时由花纱布公司统筹供应或代购，或由工商行政部门拨发购棉证到划定地区自购，这样就改变了棉花市场一度发生的紊乱现象。湖北沙市、沙道观等产棉区的各国营贸易公司十月份从各地调去了大批的粮、盐、布匹、煤油、肥皂和手工业产品，源源供应棉农。沙市的花纱布公司对沙市的供应量就比原先扩大了五倍。在河南陕州产棉区，花纱布公司十月份就供应了数量相当于第三季度百分之一百八十的布匹，百货公司也供应了数量相当于九月份百分之一百六十的百货。为了保证全区棉价稳定和非产棉区农民对絮棉的需要，各地花纱布公司在十、十一两月内共供应絮棉五万九千多担。充分供应物资后，各地棉花上市量很快增加。花纱布公司湖北沙道观分公司十月份购棉数量就超过原定计划一倍以上。河南各地自十月下旬大量供应絮棉后，使棉花牌价和市价大致接近，在十一月就完成了九月到十二月四个月的购棉任务。和这同时，湖北、河南部分产棉地区的人民政府注意对棉农进行了爱国主义教育，因而棉农售棉情绪很高，更保证了各地国营花纱布公司购棉任务很快完成。如河南南阳专区很多区、乡都先后召开过农民代表会和棉农座谈会，方城县人民政府的县长亲自到农村检查和督促购棉工作。这样，全专区十月下旬每天收购量比十月初增加了大约五倍。（新华社）
    华东区各地合作社
    提前完成全年购棉任务
    华东区各地合作社提前一个月超额完成了今年收购新棉的任务。从九月下旬到十二月五日止，全区购储的棉花已超过原定计划百分之十三。目前华东区各地合作社正继续收购中。
    今年新棉上市以来，华东区各地棉农连续进行了爱国主义集体售棉运动，全区收棉工作每月都超过了原定的计划。全区棉农十月下半月就开始归还今年春天合作社贷给他们的大米和肥料贷款，截至十二月五日的不完全统计，除受灾比较严重的苏北棉区和其他地区少数困难的农户外，棉农们已全部还清了合作社贷给的大米和肥料贷款。各地棉农并把不急需换钱的棉花存在合作社。仅山东、苏南、皖南和上海市郊的棉农，向合作社存储的皮棉就已达到二千五百八十多万斤。从十一月份起，各地合作社开始用信托存实办法，帮助国营花纱布公司减少现金投放。
    华东区各地合作社在收购新棉中大量供应棉农生活必需品，使合作社在农村中的威信更加提高。山东省广饶县合作社自进行收购棉花工作以来，已有二千八百多个棉农申请入社。该县新棉产区的棉农，也纷纷要求政府帮助他们建社。
    目前华东全区合作社正普遍展开存实业务，动员社员把棉花存给合作社预购年货和肥料，争取收购更多的棉花。（新华社）
    华北区粮食公司和合作社
    上两月超额完成购粮任务
    华北区国营粮食公司和合作社十、十一两月份超额完成购粮计划。十月份购粮总数超过收购计划百分之三十点四五，十一月份购粮总数超过计划百分之二十五点五二。
    华北区各级人民政府和国营粮食公司对粮食收购工作的重视，是今秋购粮计划超额完成的主要原因之一。各地粮食公司除在城镇设立固定收粮站外，还和各地合作社共同组成许多收粮小组，深入农村收购。山西省榆次专区组织的收购小组，就有一百六十个。各地实行了重点收购的办法，使收购工作进展得比往年快，并使产粮区粮价保持平稳。同时，由于在收购中贯彻了粮食分等论价的政策，今年国营粮食公司和合作社收购的粮食，质量也比往年好。　（新华社）
    普洱专区少数民族地区
    贸易公司积极收购新棉
    云僰（泰）族、卡瓦、倮黑等少数民族聚居区新棉陆续上市，当地国营贸易公司正积极收购，同时并大量供给各民族迫切需要的食盐。
    普洱专区所属车里、佛海、南峤、澜沧等县，是云南省产棉区之一，解放前因交通困难，各民族人民所产棉花没有销路，棉价低贱，以致大量棉田荒芜或改种了鸦片。解放后，人民政府鼓励各民族农民种棉，贷给棉籽、农具等，大大鼓舞了该区各民族人民生产情绪。据初步估计，普洱专区少数民族地区今年增产的棉花、约在十万斤以上。该专区国营贸易公司为照顾少数民族聚居地区食盐奇缺的情况，规定了棉花和食盐的合理比价。该专区各民族人民现在都踊跃地把新棉卖给国家。　（新华社）
