Staff member Wu Binggen of the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative Cotton Processing Factory in Nanhui County, Sunan District, invented a triangular traction bar for roller cotton gins during the patriotic production increase and economization movement, completely eliminating the previously unavoidable oil-stained cotton from roller gins. Because the cost of adding it is only 31,600 yuan, the method of installing the triangular traction bar has been rapidly promoted. Now all 36 roller cotton gins in the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative Cotton Processing Factory have been equipped with triangular traction bars. The first and second cotton processing factories of the Nanhui County Cooperative Union have also successively adopted this device. According to the technical department of the East China Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, after the promotion of this new invention, the power roller ginning factories in the whole region can save more than 500,000 jin of ginned cotton every year. If the manual roller ginning machines use the same device, the amount of ginned cotton saved in the whole region will be even greater. The structural principle of the triangular traction bar is not complicated. It is a rectangular wooden bar with the same length as the gin roller, wrapped with lead sheet, and has iron shaft cores screwed at both ends. It is installed on the bearing in front of the roller, and a small wooden disk is used to drag the belt on the wooden disk of the roller iron core, rotating in the same direction. The rotating speed is that the roller rotates three times, and the triangular bar rotates one side. This allows the ginned cotton to smoothly pass through the traction of the triangular bar and fall into the cotton bucket, which not only eliminates the waste of oil-stained cotton, but also makes the ginned cotton without wrinkles and with good sheet. Wu Binggen's invention solved the problem of oil-stained cotton waste in the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative Cotton Processing Factory during the production increase and economization movement. During the production increase and economization movement, under the slogan of "ginning and transporting quickly," the production efficiency of each ginning machine has increased from 17 jin per hour to 20 jin. However, the whole factory of 36 machines still produces 36 jin of oil-stained cotton a day and night. Oil-stained cotton cannot be supplied to spinning mills for spinning, but can only be sold to paper mills to make pulp at less than a quarter of the price of ginned cotton. Therefore, some workers said: "If we don't eliminate oil-stained cotton, we are still increasing production on one hand and wasting on the other." Now, thanks to the installation of the triangular traction bar, the oil-stained cotton is eliminated, and the whole factory can gin 900 jin more ginned cotton in a month. (Xinhua News Agency)

    创三角牵引棒完全消灭皮辊油污花
    苏南区南汇县大团供销合作社棉花加工厂职员吴秉根在爱国增产节约运动中，创设了辊轴轧花车上的三角牵引棒，全部消灭了一向不可避免的皮辊油污花。因为添设的费用只要三万一千六百元，安装三角牵引棒的方法已被迅速推广。现在大团供销合作社棉花加工厂的三十六部辊轴轧花车都已安装了三角牵引棒。南汇县合作社联合社第一、第二两个棉花加工厂也已先后采用了这一装置。据中国花纱布公司华东区公司的技术部门估计，这一新创造推广后，可使全区动力辊轴轧花厂每年节省皮棉五十万斤以上，如人力辊轴轧花机采用同样装置，全区节约皮棉的数量还会更大。三角牵引棒的构造原理并不复杂。它是一条长短和轧花车皮辊相等的正三角形檀木棒，外面包有铅皮，两端有螺丝旋紧的铁轴芯。它安装在皮辊前的轴承上，用小木盘带上皮带拖在辊轴铁心的木盘上，向同一方向旋转。转动的速度是皮辊转三次，三角棒转一面。这样使皮棉滑顺地经三角棒的牵引，落入盛花桶中，不但消灭了油污花的浪费现象，而且使轧出的皮棉没有绉纹，片张良好。吴秉根的这一创造，解决了大团供销合作社棉花加工厂在增产节约运动中油污花的浪费问题。在增产节约运动中，工人们在“快轧快运”的口号下，每部轧花车的生产效率已由每小时轧花十七斤提高到二十斤。但全厂三十六部车一昼夜还是要出三十六斤油污花。油污花不能供给纱厂纺纱，只能以不到四分之一的皮棉价格卖给纸厂做纸浆。因此有的工人说：“不消灭油污花，还是一面增产一面浪费。”现在由于安装了三角牵引棒，消灭了油污花，全厂一个月就可多轧出九百斤皮棉。（新华社）
