Several cotton textile factories in Shanxi Province have not promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The main reason is that some workers, especially some leading cadres, are ideologically resistant to this advanced work method. Some workers said, "This is nothing special, nothing remarkable." Some said, "The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is just about selling more labor. If we put in more effort, we can be the same as her and reduce roller lapping." Some believe that "The Hao Jianxiu Work Method can only be applied in the spinning room and cannot be used elsewhere." It is easy to understand why workers, not understanding the significance and advantages of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, are unwilling to learn it. As long as the leadership is good, this conservative thinking of the workers can be easily broken. However, the leading cadres of these textile factories also believe that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is not such an advanced work method. Therefore, they do not actively publicize the advantages of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, let alone actively organize workers to learn it. They even say, "The factory is very busy now, so we can't take care of promoting it for the time being. We'll talk about it later." In this way, the Hao Jianxiu Work Method cannot be promoted. Textile factories with this situation should immediately conduct in-depth inspections, correct wrong thinking, and earnestly implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    山西若干棉纺织厂没有推广郝建秀工作法
    山西若干棉纺织厂，还没有推广郝建秀工作法。主要的原因是：一部分工人，特别是一部分领导干部，在思想上抵抗这一先进工作方法。有的工人说：“这也不算怎样出奇，没有什么了不起”，有的说：“郝建秀工作法只不过是多卖些劳力罢了，如果我们也多加些力，照样和她一样，皮辊花也能减少”；有的认为：“郝建秀工作法只能在细纱间运用，放在别的地方就用不上”。工人不了解郝建秀工作法的意义和优点，因此不愿意去学习，这是容易理解的。只要领导得好，工人这种保守思想，是容易打破的。但是，这些纺织厂的领导干部，也认为郝建秀工作法，不算什么先进工作法。因此，便不积极地宣传郝建秀工作法的优点，更不积极地组织工人学习，他们甚至说：“现在厂里忙得很，暂且还顾不上推广，以后再说。”这样，郝建秀工作法当然就无法推广了。有这种情况的纺织厂，应该立即深入检查，纠正错误思想，把郝建秀工作法，认真推行起来。
