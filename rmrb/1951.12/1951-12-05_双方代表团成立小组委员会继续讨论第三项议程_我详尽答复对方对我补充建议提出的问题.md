Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th. After our side proposed two supplementary suggestions on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 3rd, the two delegations agreed at the delegation meeting on the morning of the 4th to establish a sub-committee to continue discussing the third agenda item. Our chief representative designated General Li Sang-jo and General Xie Fang as representatives to the sub-committee. The other side's sub-committee representatives were General Tenner and General Hodge. At the sub-committee meeting held at 2 p.m., our representatives answered in detail the questions raised by the other side regarding our two supplementary principle suggestions. Our representatives pointed out that there is only reason to withdraw armed forces and personnel and weapons and ammunition from Korea during the armistice period, and there is no reason to continue importing armed forces and personnel and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea. Therefore, our side suggests that both sides should guarantee not to import any military forces, weapons or ammunition from outside Korea under any pretext, including rotation and replenishment. As for individual returnees, they may be allowed to return to Korea after being examined by the neutral nations supervisory body within the scope stipulated by the Armistice Commission. We absolutely cannot allow one of the belligerents to conduct free inspections in the other side's rear areas outside the demilitarized zone and interfere in the other side's internal affairs. Therefore, our side suggests that during the armistice, both sides jointly invite representatives of neutral countries in the Korean War to form a supervisory body, responsible for conducting necessary inspections at the ports of the rear areas agreed upon by both sides outside the demilitarized zone, in order to strictly guarantee that neither side transports any military forces and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea.

    双方代表团成立小组委员会继续讨论第三项议程
    我详尽答复对方对我补充建议提出的问题
    【新华社开城四日电】三日我方提出对于朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的两项补充建议后，四日上午的代表团会议上双方代表团同意成立小组委员会继续讨论第三项议程。我方首席代表指定李相朝将军与解方将军为小组委员会代表，对方小组委员会代表为滕纳将军与霍治将军。在下午二时举行的小组委员会上，我方代表详尽地答复了对方对于我方两项补充原则建议所提出的问题。我方代表指出：在停战期间只有从朝鲜撤出武装部队和人员与武器弹药的理由，而没有任何自朝鲜境外继续输入武装部队和人员与武器弹药的理由。因此我方建议双方应保证不从朝鲜境外以任何藉口包括轮换与补充在内输入任何军事力量、武器和弹药。至于个别的归队人员，则根据停战委员会所规定的范围内经过中立国监察机构的审查，可以准许回到朝鲜。我们根本不能容许交战的一方到非军事区以外的对方的后方进行自由视察，干涉对方内政。因此，我方建议在停战期间双方共同邀请在朝鲜战争中的中立国家的代表成立监察机构，负责到非军事区以外的双方同意的后方的口岸进行必要的视察，以严格保证双方不自朝鲜境外运进任何军事力量和武器弹药。
