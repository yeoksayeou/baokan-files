Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st – The Northwest Military and Political Committee held its Fourth Plenary Session from November 22nd to 29th. Based on the specific situation in the Northwest region, the meeting, after careful discussion and research, decided on the main aspects and methods for carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement in the Northwest region. 1. All state-owned factories, mines, and local enterprises must, on the basis of existing equipment and original production plans, start by improving equipment utilization rates, promoting advanced experience, clearing assets and raw materials, and reducing management expenses, so as to fully exploit all potential forces, increase production quantity and quality, and reduce waste products and losses. Each factory and mine should formulate a full-year increase production and practice economy plan for 1952 before mid-December, report it to the Northwest Military and Political Committee for approval, and mobilize and rely on all employees to strive to complete the plan. Newly built factories and mines and the addition of equipment to existing factories and mines must ensure that construction starts on schedule, and the increase production and practice economy movement must be promoted in the same way. All localities should encourage and guide private investment in industry and mining, and carry out the increase production and practice economy movement in private enterprises. In addition, local enterprises should be developed in a planned manner, and resource exploration should be strengthened, so as to carry out key construction in a prepared and planned manner. 2. In agriculture, strive to increase grain production by 1 billion catties and cotton by 600,000 dan next year by increasing the yield per unit area. The responsible departments at all levels should make specific plans to guide farmers in carrying out mutual aid, accumulating fertilizer, applying fertilizer, preventing and controlling pests and diseases, and improving and developing water conservancy projects to ensure the completion of this task. In animal husbandry, strive to increase the number of livestock such as cattle and horses by 350,000 heads and sheep by 2.5 million next year. In forestry, plant 210,000 mu of forests and close hillsides for afforestation on 2 million mu next year. Encourage farmers to raise pigs and sheep to accumulate fertilizer, and plant field-protecting forests, so that agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production can be combined with each other. 3. Financial and trade work must be closely integrated with production and serve production. The state-owned trade system should adapt to the needs of the development of the public and private economy, and ensure that the total value of purchases next year increases by 50 percent compared with this year, and the total value of sales increases by 100 percent. Support cooperatives, so that the number of cooperative members next year will be twice as many as this year, and the capital stock will be doubled. Strengthen guidance to private commerce, strengthen the management of the market, and stabilize prices more effectively. 4. Strengthen financial work. Ensure the completion of the tasks of public grain and taxation. Strictly manage all kinds of warehouses, and strive to reduce or even completely avoid losses. Conscientiously abide by budget and final accounts and various financial systems. Ensure the necessary expenses for national defense construction and economic construction, and other undertakings should be carried out according to one's ability, and resolutely overcome the egalitarianism of not distinguishing between priorities and doing everything at once. 5. Streamline organizations and improve work efficiency. According to the principle of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels, the personnel reduced should be used to enrich grassroots organizations as much as possible. Reduce levels, simplify procedures, give play to the initiative and creativity of staff, and improve work efficiency. 6. Practice strict economy and launch a struggle against corruption and waste and against bureaucracy. Strengthen the financial management of various undertakings and organs, use money rationally, and criticize and correct the irresponsible bureaucratic style of wasting money and not doing a good job. In addition to giving necessary care to the lives of staff members so as not to reduce them, strive to save on the expenses of organs, advocate cherishing public property, and promote the fine tradition of hard work and thrift. Corruption cases discovered in all aspects must be thoroughly investigated, dealt with seriously, and necessary struggles must be carried out to educate cadres. Those who seriously damage state property must be severely punished.
During the meeting, the entire staff of more than 20 public and private enterprises in the Northwest region and more than 230 mutual aid groups in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, and eight people including labor model Pu Zhongzhi from Chang'an County, successively formulated increase production and practice economy plans and wrote letters to respond to the call of the conference.
At the end of the meeting, Xi Zhongxun, vice chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, made a concluding report entitled "Struggle for Carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement." Xi Zhongxun pointed out that carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement and strengthening the strength to resist US aggression and aid Korea is the biggest political task of the people of the whole country at present. He listed the tremendous achievements already made in the Northwest region in increasing production and practicing economy in many industrial and mining sectors, and criticized the erroneous views of some people who believe that "the economy in the Northwest is backward and there is little possibility of increasing production" and "the Northwest is poor and cannot save much." Xi Zhongxun said that after this meeting, all parts of the Northwest should conduct a rectification and study movement with the main contents of continuing to oppose bureaucracy, oppose corruption, and oppose waste, combined with inspection of work, carrying forward democracy, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, carrying forward strengths, correcting shortcomings, and solving outstanding problems, so as to improve cadres' thinking, enforce state laws and discipline, improve work style, and promote the increase production and practice economy movement.
The meeting also reviewed and summarized the main work in the eight months since the Third Plenary Session of the Northwest Military and Political Committee. The meeting listened to the report of Zhang Zhizhong, vice chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, on the transmission of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and listened to and adopted the report of Xi Zhongxun, director of the Northwest Military and Political Committee Land Reform Committee, on land reform and rent reduction work, the report of Jia Tuofu, deputy director of the Financial and Economic Committee, on the economic and financial work of the Northwest region and the carrying out of the increase production and practice economy movement, Yang Mingxuan, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Northwest Branch of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, on the anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement in the Northwest in the past year, Li Qiming, deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Security, on the overview of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the past eight months and future tasks, and Zhang Jiafu, deputy director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, on the cultural and educational work in the Northwest in the past year.
