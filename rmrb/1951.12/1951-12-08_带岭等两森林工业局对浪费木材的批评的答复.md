    Response from the Dailing and Other Two Forest Industrial Bureaus to Criticism of Waste of Timber

    To the Editors: Our bureau, based on the criticism made by some students from the Forestry Department of Northeast Agricultural College in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on September 12, conducted a thorough inspection and found that some work stations were using slightly decayed but still usable timber for firewood. When logging began this year, our bureau decided that if there were good parts in the poles and fallen trees used for firewood, they should be collected and utilized. We must earnestly implement this in the future so that not a single meter of timber is lost. In addition, the timber along the railway tracks was due to derailments and other reasons that caused single or multiple pieces of timber to fall off the train onto both sides of the railway. These fallen timber pieces are recorded in detail and collected and transported back by the forest railway management organization within a certain period of time. We are very grateful to the students of the Forestry Department of Northeast Agricultural College for their suggestions. We have notified all subordinate work units to strictly prohibit wasting any meter of timber.
        Bi Deyu, Director of Dailing Forest Industry Experimental Bureau

    To the Editors: The criticism of the waste of timber in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area by some students from the Forestry Department of Northeast Agricultural College published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on September 12 is correct. After reading the criticism in the newspaper, we sent the deputy chief of the operations section to the Daqiao construction site of the Second Operations Unit to check whether good timber was used to build houses. As a result, it was found that two workers' dormitories were built with good Korean pine planks. At the same time, our bureau convened a meeting of the heads of the work units, work team leaders, and firewood workers to check whether good timber was used as fuel, but no such situation was found. In addition to notifying all subordinate work units to discuss and inspect, our bureau will regularly conduct thorough inspections in the future to avoid wasting timber.
        An Qingyuan, Deputy Director of the Wumin Branch of the Yichun Forest Industry Administration

    带岭等两森林工业局
    对浪费木材的批评的答复
    编辑同志：我局根据东北农学院森林系部分同学在九月十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏上提出的批评，进行了彻底的检查，发现各作业站有用腐朽较轻但还可利用的木材作柴烧的事情。今年开始采伐时，我局曾决定凡作柴烧的站杆和倒木，其中如有好的部分应检收利用。这一点我们今后必须认真执行，不使一公尺木材受到损失。另外，关于铁路两旁的木料，是因列车脱线等缘故，使车上单根或多根木料颠落到铁路沿线两侧。这些颠落的木料都有详细记载，并在一定时间内由森林铁路管理机关搜集后运回。我们很感谢东北农学院森林系部分同学对我们提出的意见。我们已通知所属各作业所，严禁浪费任何一公尺木材。    带岭森林工业实验局局长    毕德育
    编辑同志：九月十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏所刊东北农学院森林系部分同学对小兴安岭林区浪费木材的批评是正确的。我们看到报纸上的批评后，就派作业股副股长到第二作业所大桥现场，检查是否有用好木料修建房屋的情事，结果查出有两座工人宿舍是用好红松板子修建的。同时，我局召集作业所长、工作队长、打柴的工友等进行座谈，检查是否有把好木料作燃料用的情事，结果没有发现这种情事。我局除通知所属各作业所讨论和检查外，今后将经常深入检查，以避免浪费木材。
        伊春森林工业管理局乌敏分局副局长    安庆元
