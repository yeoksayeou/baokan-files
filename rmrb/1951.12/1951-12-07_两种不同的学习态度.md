    Two Different Attitudes Towards Learning

    Recently, newspapers have successively published articles about teachers' ideological remolding studies. These articles have generally attracted the attention of teachers in various universities. They have two different understandings of the self-criticisms of some teachers:

    Most people believe that these self-criticisms are "very good," that "their spirit of self-criticism has enlightened me," and that "after reading their articles, I feel that my own learning is not thorough enough, and I have not examined my own pain points at all." Some teachers have expressed that they want to learn from their spirit of daring to expose shortcomings, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and resolutely transform their own thinking. This attitude is correct.

    A few people have different opinions. Some people say: "I didn't expect them to have such heavy baggage. I'm so old, and I don't have as much as they do!" Some say: "Their self-criticisms are profound, but I still don't believe they can progress so quickly. It's probably opportunism, showing off!" Individual professors even say: "They are being used!"

    These two different reactions represent two different attitudes towards learning; they also reflect two different positions and viewpoints.

    Is the baggage left to us by the old society light? In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, many young students exposed their pro-American and worship-American thoughts. When they spoke of painful things, they often wept bitterly; and some university professors, who have been infected by old thoughts and old habits for decades, feel that their baggage is not heavy. Is this a fact? Some people think that they do not have old ideological baggage, that they are "untainted by mud." Is this a fact?

    Everyone knows that, due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the thinking of the broad masses of the Chinese people has undergone tremendous changes, but some people find other people's progress incredible, and even "don't believe they can progress so quickly." This just shows that he himself has fallen behind the wheels of the times. There is no other way to remedy this but to catch up quickly.

    Are they "opportunistic, showing off," or "being used"? This is a completely muddled idea. Others sincerely examine themselves, have the courage to expose their mistakes in public, and are willing to throw off their baggage and seek progress, but you think this is "opportunism" or "being used"; then, what is it called to stubbornly cling to those dirty things贩来的 from the reactionary bourgeoisie of Europe and America and inherited from the feudal landlord class, and to "admire oneself in isolation" in a snail shell?

    Criticism and self-criticism are weapons for self-transformation. If we abandon this weapon, there is no way to talk about ideological remolding. All those who hold erroneous views on the ideological remolding movement should wake up, do not stand outside the movement, point fingers and pick on others' faults, or even deliberately slander others, but should honestly participate in this movement, thoroughly transform their own thinking, and better serve the people.

### 两种不同的学习态度

    两种不同的学习态度
    最近，报纸上陆续发表了一些关于教师思想改造学习的文章。这些文章普遍引起了各大学教师的注意。他们对某些教师的检讨有两种不同的认识：
    多数人认为这些检讨“好得很”，“他们的自我批评精神，启发了我”，“看了他们的文章，我觉得自己的学习太不深入了，根本没有检讨到自己的痛处”。有些教师表示：要学习他们勇于暴露缺点的精神，响应毛主席的号召，坚决改造自己的思想。这种态度是正确的。
    少数人则有不同的意见。有的人说：“想不到他们有这样重的包袱，我年纪这样大还没有他们的重呢！”有的说：“他们的检讨是深刻的，但是我仍不相信他们能进步这样快，恐怕是投机，出风头！”个别的教授甚至说：“他们受人利用！”
    这两种不同的反应，代表着两种不同的学习态度；也反映了两种不同的立场和观点。
    旧社会遗留给我们的包袱轻吗？在抗美援朝运动中，许多青年学生，揭发了自己的亲美崇美的思想，说到沉痛处，他们往往痛哭流涕；而几十年来受到旧思想、旧习气侵染的某些大学教授，反觉得自己的包袱不重，这是事实吗？有的人认为自己没有旧的思想包袱，“出污泥而不染”，这是事实吗？
    人人皆知，由于中国人民革命的胜利，广大中国人民的思想已经起了巨大的变化，而某些人却对别人的进步感到不可思议，甚至“不相信他们能进步这样快”。这正说明了他自己已经落在时代车轮的后边了，解救之道无他，只有急起直追。
    “他们投机，出风头”“受人利用”吗？这是一种十足的糊涂思想。别人诚恳地检讨了自己，有勇气在大庭广众之前暴露自己的错误，愿意扔下包袱求得进步，而你却认为这就是“投机”，“受人利用”；那么，死抱住从欧美反动资产阶级那里贩来的、从封建地主阶级那里继承下来的那些脏东西，钻在蜗牛壳里“孤芳自赏”，这算是什么呢？
    批评与自我批评是自我改造的武器，要是放弃了这个武器，是谈不上什么思想改造的。一切对思想改造运动持有错误见解的人，应该猛省，不要站在运动之外，指手划脚地硬挑别人的岔子，甚至存心诬蔑别人，而应该老老实实地投入这个运动，彻底改造自己的思想，更好地为人民服务。
