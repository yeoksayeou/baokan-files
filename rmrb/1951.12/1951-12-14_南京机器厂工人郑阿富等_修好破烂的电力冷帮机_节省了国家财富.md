    Nanjing Machine Factory Worker Zheng Afu and Others
    Repair Dilapidated Electric Paint Spraying Machine
    Saving National Wealth
    Editor: During the production increase and economy drive, Zheng Afu and other workers at the Nanjing Machine Factory's repair workshop repaired an old paint spraying machine (a machine used for spraying paint, etc.) found in a pile of scrap iron, saving the country a great deal of wealth. The factory originally had a paint spraying machine, worth over 200 million yuan, which was gasoline-powered. Recently, the factory has been using the paint spraying machine more frequently, and the workers in the repair workshop felt that using gasoline to operate the machine was not cost-effective. Zheng Afu came up with the idea of switching to an electric paint spraying machine. This idea was approved by the administration, and they went to Shanghai to purchase one, but there were no machines in stock. As soon as Zheng Afu learned of this, he rushed to search everywhere and found an electric paint spraying machine (with a damaged cylinder and elbow) in a scrap iron pile in a branch factory. With the help of fitter Zhu Yanlin and Tang Hexian, Zheng Afu repaired the dilapidated electric paint spraying machine after a month of work. Now, this electric paint spraying machine can reach 60 pounds of pressure, and the original gasoline-powered paint spraying machine has been taken out of service. After this improvement, the fuel cost is four-fifths less with electricity than with gasoline; in terms of labor management, it used to require a Grade 4 technician to manage, but now it only requires a basic odd-job worker, with a difference of more than one-half in wage value; in terms of machine price, a gasoline paint spraying machine costs 200 million yuan, while an electric paint spraying machine, even new, only costs 30 million yuan.

    南京机器厂工人郑阿富等
    修好破烂的电力冷帮机
    节省了国家财富
    编辑同志：南京机器厂保修工场工人郑阿富等，在增产节约运动中，修理好一部从废铁中找到的冷帮机（喷漆等用的机器），替国家节省了很多财富。厂里原有一部冷帮机，价值二亿多元，是用汽油发动的。最近厂里使用冷帮机的机会多，保修工场的工人都觉得用汽油开冷帮机不合算。郑阿富就想出了改用电力冷帮机的办法。这个办法得到行政方面的同意，就到上海去购买，但上海没有现货。郑阿富一知道这个消息，就急忙到各处找寻，在分厂的烂铁堆中找到了一部电力冷帮机（汽缸和弯头都烂掉了），在钳工朱衍林、唐鹤贤的帮助下，经过一个月的功夫，郑阿富把破旧的电力冷帮机修好了。现在，这部电力冷帮机已能打到六十磅的汽，原有的汽油冷帮机已停止使用了。经过这一改进后，在燃料成本方面，用电比用汽油节省五分之四；在人工管理方面，过去要四级工资技工管理，现在只要起码杂工管理，工资价值相差二分之一多；在机器价格方面，汽油冷帮机要二亿元，电力冷帮机即使新的也只要三千万元。　蔡继三
