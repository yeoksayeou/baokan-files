    Beijing People's Court Publicly Tries Sixteen Real Estate Brokerage Cases
    Liu Dayin and others were sentenced to imprisonment respectively, and brokerage fees were recovered and confiscated.
    In order to resolutely implement the "Decree on Banning Real Estate Brokerage" issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Government on April 13 this year, protect the legitimate rights of landlords, tenants, buyers, and sellers in leasing and buying and selling real estate, and ban all illegal acts of local ruffians using brokerage to extort or inflate housing prices, the Beijing Municipal People's Court held a collective public sentencing on sixteen cases of brokers, including Liu Dayin, on December 8.
    The most serious of the sixteen real estate brokerage cases are as follows:
    Liu Dayin had been a real estate broker for many years and was one of the famous brokers in Beijing. As early as 1948, he established the "Liu Dayin Advertising Agency," boasting about buying and selling and renting houses on behalf of others, from which he made huge profits. After the liberation of Beijing, he was sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year reprieve by the Beijing People's Court for participating in the theft and sale of enemy property. After the government explicitly banned real estate brokerage, he continued to engage in brokerage activities. On April 15 this year, he introduced Wang Zengrui to rent four rooms of Chen Liu's house, from which he extorted 250,000 yuan in brokerage fees from Wang Zengrui. In the same month, he also introduced Zhu Zhenxi to buy a house, which was discovered by the local real estate exchange and criticized and educated. He immediately issued a letter of repentance, guaranteeing that he would no longer engage in the activity. However, on May 2, he extorted 400,000 yuan in brokerage fees from Zhu Zhenxi. Because he consistently engaged in brokerage, extorted and exploited people, and repeatedly refused to mend his ways after education, the court sentenced him to seven years in prison, revoked the original suspended sentence, and combined the sentences to execute seven and a half years of imprisonment. The brokerage fee of 650,000 yuan was recovered and confiscated. If the recovery fails, it should be converted to one day of labor for every 10,000 yuan.
    Liu Shunchen and Wan Jingyu had both been real estate brokers for eight years. After the government issued a notice banning real estate brokerage, they engaged in brokerage activities in a disguised manner. It has been found that there were five times from May to September this year, extorting brokerage fees of 900,500 yuan. Wan Jingyu was sentenced to five years in prison. Liu Shunchen was sentenced to four years in prison. The 900,500 yuan in brokerage fees they obtained was recovered and confiscated. If the recovery fails, it should be converted to one day of labor for every 10,000 yuan.
    Wang Jianqiu, Yang Shumin, and Zhang Yuzhen were also old brokers. In June, citizen Wu Zhensheng had three houses for sale, which were sold through their introduction, and they received 12 bolts of cloth in brokerage fees from the old owner (Wu Zhensheng). According to the severity of the crimes of these three criminals, the Beijing People's Court sentenced Wang Jianqiu and Yang Shumin to three years in prison, and Zhang Yuzhen to one year in prison; and the number of bolts of cloth obtained by each criminal was recovered and confiscated. If the recovery fails, it should be converted to one day of labor for every 10,000 yuan.
    Zhong Xianglin had been engaged in real estate brokerage activities since 1947 and had never stopped. From June to August this year, he introduced the leasing of houses three times, extorting 190,000 yuan in brokerage fees. He was sentenced to three years in prison, and all brokerage fees were recovered and confiscated.
    Feng Pengqian, Feng Xianglin, Jia Yuzhou, Xu Guanghui, and Bian Xiaokun were all brokers who frequently engaged in brokerage activities. In April this year, Yongzeng Clothing Factory sold a house at No. 60 Taiping Street for 1,000 bolts of cloth. The criminals colluded with each other to introduce the house to the General Political Department of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission. At the same time, the Beijing Branch of the North China Fur Company also contacted the house owner. The defendants took the opportunity to raise the house price to 1,800 bolts of Five Blessings Cloth and sold it to the General Political Department. After being discovered by the real estate exchange, the transaction was completed with 1,400 bolts of Five Blessings Cloth. The brokers jointly extorted 56 bolts of Five Blessings Cloth in brokerage fees from the buyer. Feng Pengqian, Feng Xianglin, and Jia Yuzhou were each sentenced to three years in prison, and Bian Xiaokun was sentenced to one year in prison; and the brokerage fees obtained by each criminal were recovered and confiscated. If the recovery fails, it should be converted to one day of labor for every 10,000 yuan.
        Zhao Zhongbo, Li Feishi, Ma Weinong, Dai Maozhen, Liu Hangci, Cui Liushi, Zhou Shishi, Wang Degui, Zhang Xiaoshi, Jia Yulong, Li Sun Shuzhen, Chen Guiying, Wang [character missing], Chai Baochen, Li Bowen, Sun Shengxian, and Liu Silu, seventeen real estate brokers who generally violated the law, were sentenced to imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes, and the brokerage fees obtained by each criminal were recovered and confiscated; if they are unable to pay, they shall all be converted to labor service.
    After the judges announced the verdicts, more than 300 representatives of real estate exchanges and citizens from Beijing who attended the hearing unanimously expressed their support.

    北京市人民法院公审十六件房纤案
    刘大隐等人被分别判处徒刑，纤费追缴没收。
    北京市人民法院为坚决执行北京市人民政府今年四月十三日颁发的取缔房纤的法令，保护房东、房客、买主、卖主的租赁、买卖房产的正当权利，取缔一切地痞流氓借拉纤敲诈勒索或哄抬房价的非法行为，十二月八日对纤手刘大隐等十六案举行了集体公开宣判。
    十六件房纤案犯罪最严重的有如下几件：
    刘大隐曾拉房纤多年，是北京市著名纤手之一。他在一九四八年就成立“刘大隐广告社”，大吹大擂地代人买卖、租典房屋，从中牟取厚利。北京解放后，曾因为参与盗卖敌产，被北京市人民法院判处徒刑六个月，缓刑二年。政府明令取缔房纤后，他继续进行拉纤活动。今年四月十五日，他介绍王增瑞租得陈刘氏房四间，从中索取王增瑞纤费二十五万元。同月，他又代朱振西介绍买得房屋一所，被当地房地产交易所查觉予以批评教育，他当即出具悔过书，保证不再活动。但是，五月二日他又索取朱振西纤费四十万元。因为他一贯拉纤，从中勒索剥削，而且屡教不改，法院把他判处徒刑七年，撤销原判缓刑，合并执行徒刑七年六个月，纤费六十五万元追缴没收。追缴不出时，应按一万元折算一日改服劳役。
    刘顺臣、万敬舆都当了八年房纤。政府布告取缔房纤后，他俩用变相的方式从事纤手活动。已经查明的，自本年五月起到九月止就有五次，索取纤费九十万零五千元。万敬舆被判处徒刑五年。刘顺臣被判处徒刑四年。并把他俩所得纤费九十万零五千元追缴没收。追缴不出时，应按一万元折算一日改服劳役。
    王剑秋、杨淑敏、张宇珍也是老纤手。六月间市民吴振声有三所房子出售，经他们介绍卖出，从中收受旧业主（吴振声）纤费布十二匹。北京市人民法院根据这三个罪犯犯罪情节轻重，判处王剑秋、杨淑敏徒刑三年，张宇珍徒刑一年；并按各犯索得布匹数目追缴没收。追缴不出时，应按一万元折算一日改服劳役。
    钟祥麟自一九四七年开始从事房纤活动，一直没有停止。今年六月到八月曾三次介绍租赁房屋，索取纤费十九万元。他被判处徒刑三年，全部纤费追缴没收。
    冯鹏骞、冯祥麟、贾裕州、徐广辉、边晓昆等都是经常进行拉纤活动的纤手。本年四月，永增被服厂以一千匹布出售太平街六十号房屋，该犯等遂先后勾结串通给中央人民革命军事委员会总政治部介绍，同时华北皮毛公司北京分公司也与该房主接洽。被告等便乘机哄抬房价高至五福布一千八百匹卖给总政治部。被房地产交易所发觉后，才以一千四百匹五福布成交。各纤手共索取买方纤费五福布五十六匹。冯鹏骞、冯祥麟、贾裕州被各处徒刑三年，边晓昆处徒刑一年；并按照各犯所得纤费追缴没收。追缴不出时，应按一万元折算一日改服劳役。
        一般故违法令的房纤赵仲波、李费氏、马慰农、戴懋宸、刘航慈、崔刘氏、周史氏、王德贵、张萧氏、贾玉龙、李孙淑贞、陈贵英、王?之、柴保臣、李博文、孙圣贤、刘思禄等十七人，法院依照他们的犯罪情节轻重分别判处徒刑，并追缴各犯所得之纤费没收；无力缴纳时；一律折服劳役。
    审判员宣示判决后，参加旁听的北京市各房地产交易所代表及市民三百余人一致表示拥护。
