    South China Native Produce Exhibition and Exchange Conference
    Transaction Volume Exceeds 1 Trillion Yuan
    The South China Native Produce Exhibition and Exchange Conference has been open for over a month, and trade has been very brisk. The total transaction volume has reached over 1,099.98 billion yuan. Among these, South China native products accounted for 83.63% of the total transaction volume. In particular, the sales volume of food, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, etc., was very large, accounting for approximately 60% of the total transaction volume. Some popular products are already experiencing supply shortages. Products that were previously slow-selling and relied on foreign sales have now become popular or have opened up the domestic market due to the establishment of new trade relations. For example, grass mat packages and preserved radish, which were previously slow-selling, are now being sold continuously. Chaozhou embroidery, which relied on foreign sales for decades, was the most difficult product to sell in South China after liberation. Now, because manufacturers have changed their business methods, shifting from manufacturing luxurious ornaments to daily necessities such as handkerchiefs and pillowcases, goods worth 7 billion yuan were sold to the Northeast this time. These examples have further dispelled the idea of relying on foreign sales among industrialists and businessmen.
    Before conducting this large-scale trading activity, the South China Native Produce Exhibition and Exchange Conference made plans in advance and prepared step-by-step. Trade delegations from various regions formulated purchase and sales plans before conducting transactions. The conference also organized a price group to promptly deal with situations such as price increases and decreases in cases of more buyers than sellers, as well as price differences between production and sales areas and seasonal price differences. During the transaction process, state-owned trading companies took the lead in buying slow-moving goods and selling fast-moving goods to maintain reasonable prices. Therefore, during the transaction process, the prices of general commodities inside and outside the conference remained stable. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华南土特产展览交流大会
    交易总额超过万亿元
    华南土特产展览交流大会开幕一个多月以来，交易十分旺盛，交易总额已达一万零九百九十八亿多元。其中华南土特产占成交总额的百分之八十三点六三，尤其是食品、干鲜果蔬等销出的数量很大，约占交易总额百分之六十。有些畅销产品已感供不应求，过去部分滞销和依靠外销的产品，已转为畅销或因建立了新的贸易关系打开了国内市场。例如一向滞销的草席包、菜脯等已源源销出。几十年来依赖外销的潮汕抽纱，解放后是华南最难销出的产品，现在因为厂商改变了经营方式，由制造华贵装饰品改为制手帕、枕套等日用品，这次就有价值七十亿元的货物销到东北。这些实例，已进一步消除了工商业者依赖外销的思想。
    华南土特产展览交流大会在进行这次大规模交易活动以前，曾预先作出了计划，并有步骤地作了准备工作。各地贸易代表团在进行交易之前，都制订了购销计划。大会并组织了价格小组，及时处理在买多卖少情况下发生的抬价压价和产销地区之间及季节性的差价等问题；国营贸易公司在交易过程中带头买冷货卖热货，维持合理价格。因此，在交易进行中，会内会外一般商品的价格都保持平稳。（新华社）
