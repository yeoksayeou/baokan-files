    Zhao Yucheng, Propagandist of Wangbaizhuang, Changli County,
    Uses Practical Examples to Promote Improved Agricultural Techniques
    Zhao Yucheng, a propagandist from Wangbaizhuang in the Second District of Changli County, is good at using practical examples to promote improvements, and the results are very good. Zhao Yucheng is the deputy leader of the Wangbaizhuang Agricultural Technology Research Group. He publicizes to the masses any experience he gains from his research. In the work of eliminating cotton aphids, he initially used one piece of cotton oil soap mixed with thirty catties of water to spray on the cotton leaves, but could only kill 70% of the aphids. At that time, the masses thought it was not clean enough and didn't want to treat it. Zhao Yucheng thought: Cotton is an important raw material for national industrial production, and the elimination of aphids cannot be delayed. He then tried using one piece of cotton oil soap mixed with twenty catties of water to spray on the cotton leaves, and the killing rate reached 90%. At the same time, he also created a method of using dry soil powder to eliminate aphids. He reported the experimental methods and results to the Party branch, and after the branch approved it, he and all the Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and cadres went to publicize it in different areas and households, and led the masses to visit the fields. Soon, all 140 mu of cotton with aphids in the village were cured.
    In April of this year, comrades from the county farm came to their village to do "Rhizobium" experiments, but the masses were afraid to try it. Zhao Yucheng considered that oral propaganda alone would not have any effect, so he mixed peanut seeds with "Rhizobium" for a field experiment. This year there was a drought, and by September the peanuts had not yet formed pods, but the peanut seedlings mixed with "Rhizobium" had grown three plump pods. Zhao Yucheng used this to publicize to the masses.
    Zhao Yucheng is not only a good propagandist, but also an active producer. He sets an example in everything he does to motivate the masses. Therefore, he was honorably elected as a district labor model at the labor model selection conference.

    昌黎王稗庄宣传员赵玉成
    用实际事例宣传改进农业技术
    我们昌黎二区王稗庄宣传员赵玉成，善于用实际事例进行宣传，效果很好。赵玉成是王稗庄农业技术研究组副组长，他从研究中得到了什么经验，就随时向群众宣传。在除治棉蚜工作中，他起初用一块棉油皂掺三十斤水在棉叶子上喷洒，只能杀死蚜虫百分之七十，当时群众嫌治不干净，都不想治。赵玉成想：棉花是国家工业生产的重要原料，扑灭蚜虫可不能拖延。他又试着用一块棉油皂掺二十斤水在棉叶上喷洒，杀虫率达到百分之九十。同时他还创造了用干土粉除治蚜虫的办法。他把试验的办法和结果报告了党支部，经支部通过后，就和全体党、团员、宣传员和干部，分片分户去宣传，并带领群众到地里参观。不久全村一百四十亩有蚜虫的棉花都治好了。
    今年四月，县农场的同志到他们村里来做“根瘤菌”试验，群众不敢试用。赵玉成考虑到光是口头宣传不会有什么效果，他就把花生籽拌了“根瘤菌”实地试验。今年天旱，到九月花生还没作成角，但拌了“根瘤菌”的花生苗上，却长了胖胖的三个角，赵玉成就用这件事向群众宣传。
    赵玉成不只是个好宣传员，还是生产积极分子。他处处以身作则带动群众，因此他在评选劳动模范大会上光荣地当选了区的劳动模范。
