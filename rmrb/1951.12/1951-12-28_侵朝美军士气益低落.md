An Insurmountable Fatal Weakness of Aggressive Wars
U.S. Troops Invading Korea Increasingly Demoralized
U.S. Aggressors Increase Troops While Delaying Negotiations
Korean and Chinese Troops Heightening Vigilance, Watching for Enemy Schemes
[Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th] Our frontline reporter reports: In the battles to defeat Van Fleet's "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army annihilated over 250,000 U.S. and accomplice and puppet troops. According to a private first class from the 5th Regiment of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division captured on November 4th: "In the first three days of the Autumn Offensive, the 5th Regiment had already suffered over half its casualties." Another captured second lieutenant platoon leader from the 7th Regiment of the same division said: "B Company of the 7th Regiment originally had 240 men, of which over 92 percent have been killed or wounded; C Company only has 15 men left, including eight wounded."

Due to heavy casualties, there are fewer and fewer experienced veterans in the U.S. invading forces, and most are new recruits. But regardless of veterans or recruits, their morale is getting lower and lower. Cases of soldiers experiencing nervous breakdowns and using various methods to evade war are increasing daily. A private first class from the 5th Regiment of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division said that after the disastrous defeat in the Autumn Offensive, in his company alone, there were more than 30 soldiers suffering from phobias. These people would tremble, even cry and shout, and be unable to eat at the mere mention of fighting. The new recruits felt particularly frightened after hearing news of heavy casualties during the offensive. In one U.S. army company, three new recruits deserted on the very day they were added, and another company deserted 24 men in four days. Many of the new recruits are young men under the age of eighteen. These people tend to cry easily, crying when they talk about their families, and crying when they are tired from walking. The low combat effectiveness of the U.S. aggressors using such soldiers to fight is self-evident.

However, the U.S. aggressors have not abandoned their war policy of continuing to invade Korea. While continuing to shamelessly employ delaying tactics at the Korean armistice talks, they are using every means to step up the replenishment of troops and increase their military strength. To achieve the above objectives, the U.S. aggressors are currently mainly taking the following measures:

First, the U.S. National Guard 40th and 45th Divisions, originally in Japan, are being transferred to Korea.

Second, they are intensifying the training of the Lee Seung-man puppet army and directly forcibly conscripting young men from South Korea to replenish troops. B Company of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Division was supplemented by seven conscripted South Korean men.

Third, they are forcing sick or injured soldiers to be discharged from the hospital early. Of the 1,400 U.S. soldiers who returned to the front on October 22, more than 170 were forced to be discharged early.

Fourth, they continue to mobilize troops in the United States through deceptive and coercive means.

But even so, the troop shortages in the U.S. military units are still difficult to fill in time. Therefore, the U.S. aggressors are harboring sinister motives at the armistice talks and insisting on unlimited "rotation" and "replenishment" in order to obtain new military forces to continue the aggression.

The more the U.S. invading army fights, the weaker it becomes, and its morale is declining day by day. This is its insurmountable fatal weakness in the aggressive war. However, the well-trained Korean and Chinese troops are heightening their vigilance, closely watching the enemy's aggressive schemes, and will give the aggressors who dare to invade even heavier blows.

### 侵朝美军士气益低落

    侵略战争不可克服的致命弱点
    侵朝美军士气益低落
    美侵略者一面拖延谈判一面增兵
    朝中部队正提高警惕注意敌阴谋
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在击败范佛里特
    “夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”的战斗中，共计歼灭美国及其帮凶和傀儡的军队达二十五万人以上。据十一月四日被俘的美国骑兵第一师第五团的一个上等兵供认：“在秋季攻势的头三天，第五团就已伤亡过半。”另一个被俘的该师第七团少尉排长说：“第七团B连原有二百四十人，被打死打伤的已在百分之九十二以上；C连只剩下十五人，其中还有八个负伤的。”
    由于伤亡惨重，美国侵略军中有战斗经验的老兵已经越来越少，大部分都是新兵。但无论老兵和新兵，他们的士气是愈来愈低了。士兵中间神经失常和用各种办法来逃避战争的事情日益增多。美国骑兵第一师第五团一个上等兵说，在秋季攻势惨败以后，仅在他连里，患恐惧病的士兵就有三十多人，这些人一听说要打仗就发抖，甚至啼哭叫喊和吃不下饭。新兵们听到进攻中伤亡惨重的消息后，特别感到恐惧。有一个美军连队中，补充的新兵当天就逃亡三人，另一个连四天内逃亡了二十四人。不少新兵都是不足十八周岁的青年，这些人的特点是容易哭泣，谈起自己的家庭时哭泣，走路累了也哭泣。美国侵略者用这种士兵来打仗，其战斗力的低下是不言而喻的。
    但是，美国侵略者仍旧没有放弃继续侵略朝鲜的战争政策，它一面在朝鲜停战谈判会议上继续无耻地施展拖延战术，一面用一切办法加紧补充兵员和增加军事力量。为了达到上述目的，目前美国侵略者主要采取以下几种办法：
    第一、原在日本的美国国民警卫军第四十师、第四十五师增调来朝鲜。
    第二、加紧训练李承晚伪军，并直接强抓南朝鲜的壮丁来补充兵员。第一师第七团B连就补充了七个被抓来的南朝鲜壮丁。
    第三、强迫生病或负伤的士兵提早出院。十月二十二日回到前线的一千四百个美军士兵中，就有一百七十多人是被迫提早出院的。
    第四、在美国国内继续以欺骗强迫的手段动员兵员。
    但是，即使如此，美军各部队兵员的缺额还是难以及时补足，因而美国侵略者在停战谈判的会议桌上包藏祸心地坚持无限制地“轮换”和“补充”，以获得继续进行侵略的新的军事力量。
    美国侵略军愈战愈弱，士气日益低落，这是它在侵略战争中不可克服的致命弱点。但是饱经锻炼的朝中部队正提高警惕，密切注意敌军的侵略阴谋，并将予敢于进犯的侵略者以更沉重的打击。
