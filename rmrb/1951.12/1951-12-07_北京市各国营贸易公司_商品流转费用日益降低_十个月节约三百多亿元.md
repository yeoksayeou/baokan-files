Beijing's state-owned trading companies have been improving their management since the beginning of this year, and commodity circulation costs are decreasing daily. According to incomplete statistics, twelve companies reduced commodity circulation costs by a total of over 32 billion yuan from January to October. Now, responding to Chairman Mao's call, the companies plan to save 7 billion yuan in November and December.

The Grain Company's increased production and savings mainly come from improving warehouse storage equipment and reducing waste. For example, changing 60,000 jin grain stacks into 120,000 jin grain bins saved a large amount of storage supplies and packaging materials. From March to May alone, 15.6 billion yuan was saved. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has achieved considerable success in reducing capital backlog. For example, the vigorous promotion of over 30,000 bolts of slow-selling fabric reduced the backlog of over 10 billion yuan in capital. In reducing transportation costs, cotton-carrying covered wagons were changed to open wagons, increasing the number of bales per car from 80 to 100, saving the freight cost of one car for every five cars transported. The Coal Company has also come up with various methods to reduce expenses: in railway transportation, goods are delivered along the line and sold directly from the original car, reducing shunting and loading/unloading costs by over 60 million yuan; the large cart workers hauling coal proposed "reducing coal loss by five jin per car per day," which resulted in a decrease in coal transportation losses, amounting to over 220 million yuan; in operational management expenses, over 600 million yuan was reduced after careful budgeting over nine months. The Retail Company strengthened its supply to consumers, accelerating capital turnover. Turnover occurred once every 81 days in January, but once every 31 days in June; a total of over 320 million yuan was saved in various business expenses.

The continuous emergence of savings demonstrates that there were past instances of waste in commodity circulation within the various companies. This waste has not been completely overcome. In the ten months of this year, according to incomplete statistics, the twelve companies wasted over 7 billion yuan. The main reasons for the waste are inappropriate allocation, poor storage, and incomplete systems. For example, after grain from the Northeast was transported to Beijing and stored for a period, it was then transferred back to Qinhuangdao, resulting in a loss of over 200 million yuan in transportation costs. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Building Materials Company, because of insufficient contact between the business and storage/transportation departments, had goods "parading" around the city, wasting over 20 million yuan in transportation costs. The Department Store had poor commodity storage in the first half of the year, resulting in a loss of over 13 million yuan. In addition, the companies held the idea of "rather more than less" when purchasing supplies, and had a "generous budget, tight spending" mentality when preparing expense plans, which also caused commodity and capital backlog. Therefore, the companies should launch a patriotic work competition centered on reducing commodity circulation costs, to accumulate more wealth for the country.

    北京市各国营贸易公司
    商品流转费用日益降低
    十个月节约三百多亿元
    北京市各国营贸易公司，从今年年初开始改善经营管理，商品流转费一天天降低。根据不完全的统计：从一月份到十月份，十二个公司减少商品流转费共三百二十多亿元。现在各公司响应毛主席号召，计划在十一、十二两个月里节约七十亿元。
    粮食公司的增产节约，主要是改进仓库保管设备，减少浪费。比如把六万斤的粮食垛变为十二万斤的粮食囤，节省了大量的保管用品和包装品，光是三月份到五月份，就节省了一百五十六亿元。花纱布公司在减少资金积压上，收到不少成绩。比如大力推销冷背货三万多匹布，减少了一百多亿资金的积压；在降低运输费上，把装棉花的棚车改为敞车，由过去每车八十包增多为一百包，运五车就节省出一车的运费。煤业公司也想出种种方法减低用费：在铁路运输上，实行沿站发货，原车出售，减少了调车费和装卸费六千多万元；拉煤的大车工人提出“每辆车每天少损失五斤煤”，结果降低了煤的运输损耗，合两亿二千多万元；在经营管理的开支上，经过精打细算，九个月减少了六亿多元。零售公司加强了对消费者的供应，资金周转加快了，
    一月份八十一天周转一次，六月份三十一天就可周转一次；在各种业务费上，一共节约了三亿二千多万元。
    节约的成绩不断出现，就说明了过去各公司在商品流转中还有浪费现象。这种浪费现象，现在并没有完全克服。今年的十个月里，据不完全的统计，十二个公司浪费了七十多亿元。浪费的主要原因是调拨不当、保管不好和制度不健全。比如东北的粮食运到北京后，经过一个时期的保管，又调回秦皇岛，这样损失的运费就有两亿多元。花纱布和建筑器材等公司，因为业务和储运部门的联系不够，发生过商品在市内“大游行”的现象，浪费了运费两千多万元。百货公司上半年商品保管得不好，损耗了一千三百多万元。此外，各公司在购买用品时抱着“宁多勿少”的思想，在编制费用计划时有“宽打窄用”的心理，也使商品和资金积压起来。因此，各公司应该开展以降低商品流转费为中心的爱国主义工作竞赛，更多地为国家积累财富。
