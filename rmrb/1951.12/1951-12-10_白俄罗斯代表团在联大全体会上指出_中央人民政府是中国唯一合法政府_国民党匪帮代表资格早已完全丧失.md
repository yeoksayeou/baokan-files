Xinhua News Agency, 9th: According to TASS, Paris: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of the 7th to discuss the report of the Credentials Committee. The American and British majority in the Credentials Committee passed a resolution advocating the recognition of the credentials of all delegations as legal. The General Assembly was discussing this resolution. However, the Belarusian delegation also submitted a proposal to the General Assembly to not recognize the credentials of the Kuomintang delegation.

The Belarusian representative, Kiselev, explained the Belarusian delegation's proposal: "The Belarusian delegation pointed out at the Credentials Committee meeting that the credentials of the Kuomintang representatives cannot be recognized because those representatives were sent by a group of bankrupt politicians who do not represent anyone. The so-called government of the Kuomintang, which was expelled by the Chinese people and fled to the island of Taiwan, is no longer the legal government representing the Chinese people. The Kuomintang group has long lost its power, long lost its control over Chinese territory and people, and at the same time, it has lost all moral and legal rights to speak for China in the United Nations. Everyone knows that the true and legal government of the Chinese people is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which now exercises state power over all of China and is supported by the broadest masses of the Chinese people. The Kuomintang elements' credentials were signed by private individuals in the name of a group of people who do not represent anyone. This situation is not permitted by Rule 27 of the 'Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly.' Therefore, the Belarusian delegation proposes that the General Assembly consider the proposal not to recognize the credentials of the representatives of the Kuomintang's so-called government at the Sixth General Assembly."

The chairman of the meeting, the British representative Jebb, then allowed the representative of the Kuomintang group, who was illegally attending this session of the United Nations General Assembly, to speak. The representative of the Kuomintang group was completely unable to address the essence of the current issue under discussion.

The US representative then spoke, suggesting that the General Assembly should immediately vote without further discussion of the Belarusian delegation's proposal. Jebb hurriedly agreed with the US representative's suggestion.

The Soviet representative, Malik, reminded the chairman that the chairman's task was to help explain the views on a particular issue. Malik cited the well-known rules of procedure and requested to speak before the vote in order to explain his reasons for voting. Although Malik's move was completely legitimate, Chairman Jebb rejected Malik's request. Then, he violated the current rules of procedure in the same rude manner and did not allow the representatives of Poland, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Czechoslovakia to speak.

The chairman then put the Credentials Committee's proposal to a vote. The delegations of the US-British bloc of countries voted in favor of the proposal, five delegations voted against it, and seven delegations abstained. Thus, although the General Assembly, under the manipulation of the US-British bloc, passed the Credentials Committee's proposal, the delegations of twelve countries did not approve of this proposal.

The General Assembly then discussed the report of the Special Political Committee on the Greek issue. The Special Political Committee had passed a resolution to establish a so-called Balkan Subcommittee to replace the notorious United Nations Balkan Committee. In fact, these two committees differ only in name, and the Balkan Subcommittee can only further expand the scope of American interference in Greece. The Soviet delegation attending the Special Political Committee had proposed a comprehensive solution to the Greek issue, stipulating: the immediate dissolution of the Balkan Committee, the cessation of American interference in Greek internal affairs, the end of terror in Greece, the declaration of amnesty, the abolition of concentration camps imprisoning Greek democrats, and the revocation of death sentences imposed by Greek courts on Greek democrats.

However, under the manipulation of the US-British bloc, the General Assembly still passed the Special Political Committee's proposal. The Soviet delegation's proposal was rejected by the US-British majority, but nevertheless, the General Assembly had to adopt a suggestion from the Soviet delegation's proposal regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between Greece and Albania and between Greece and Bulgaria.

    白俄罗斯代表团在联大全体会上指出
    中央人民政府是中国唯一合法政府
    国民党匪帮代表资格早已完全丧失
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会于七日上午举行全体会议，讨论全权证书委员会的报告。全权证书委员会中的美英多数派通过了一个决议，主张承认所有代表团的全权证书为合法，大会所讨论的，就是这个决议。但是，同时白俄罗斯代表团还向大会提出了不承认国民党代表团的全权证书的提案。
    白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫解释白俄罗斯代表团的这个提案说：“白俄罗斯代表团曾在全权证书委员会会议上指出，国民党代表的全权证书是不能予以承认的，因为那些代表是由不代表任何人的一帮破产了的政客派来的。被中国人民所驱逐而逃亡到台湾岛上的国民党的所谓政府，已经不再是代表中国人民的合法政府了。国民党集团早已丧失了政权，早已丧失了对中国领土和人民的控制，同时，也就丧失了代表中国在联合国发言的一切道义权利和法律权利。大家都知道，中国人民的真正而且合法的政府，是中华人民共和国中央人民政府，这个政府现在对全中国行使着国家权力，受到中国人民最广大的拥护。国民党分子的全权证书是由私人以一帮不代表任何人的人们的名义签发的，这种情况是‘大会议事规则’第二十七条规则所不容许的，既然如此，所以白俄罗斯代表团提出不承认国民党的所谓政府的代表在第六届大会上的全权证书的提案，请求大会审议。”
    主持会议的英国代表杰伯于是让非法出席本届联合国大会的国民党集团的代表发言。国民党集团的代表完全无法谈到当前所讨论的问题的本质。
    美国代表接着发言，他建议大会应不再讨论白俄罗斯代表团的提案而立即进行表决。杰伯赶忙赞同美国代表的建议。
    苏联代表马立克提醒主席说，主席的任务是帮助说明对某一问题的观点。马立克援引大家都知道的议事规则，要求在投票之前发言以便说明他的投票理由。虽然马立克的这个举动是完全正当的，但是主席杰伯拒绝了马立克的要求。接着，他又以同样粗暴的态度违反现行议事规则，不许波兰、乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的代表发言。
    主席于是把全权证书委员会的提案提付表决。美英集团国家的代表团投票赞成这个提案，有五个代表团投反对票，七个代表团弃权。这样，虽然大会在美英集团操纵下通过了全权证书委员会的提案，但是有十二个国家的代表团对这个提案不表赞成。
    大会继而讨论特别政治委员会关于希腊问题的报告。特别政治委员会已经通过了设立所谓巴尔干小组委员会来代替声名狼藉的联合国巴尔干委员会的决议。事实上这两个委员会只是名义上有不同，而巴尔干小组委员会实际上只能更加扩大美国对希腊干涉的范围。出席特别政治委员会的苏联代表团曾提出全面解决希腊问题的提案，并且规定：立即解散巴尔干委员会，停止美国对希腊内政的干涉，结束希腊国内的恐怖，宣布大赦，取消囚禁希腊民主分子的集中营，撤销希腊法院对希腊民主分子的死刑判决。
    但是，大会在美英集团的操纵下，还是通过了特别政治委员会的提案。苏联代表团的提案被美英多数否决，但是，尽管如此，大会也不得不通过苏联代表团提案中关于规定希腊与阿尔巴尼亚之间以及希腊与保加利亚之间建立外交关系的一项建议。
