    Hoping Post Offices in Various Regions Improve the Distribution of "China Young Pioneers Daily"
    Comrade Editor: Since the "China Young Pioneers Daily" was first published on November 5th, although only eight issues have been released recently, it has already reached a circulation of 240,000 copies. It has become a newspaper with a wide readership. In order to meet the expectations of readers, the "China Young Pioneers Daily" is printed two days in advance for each issue. At the same time, it is handed over to the post office for distribution and there has never been any delay.
    However, recently many readers have written to complain that "they cannot receive the newspaper on time." For example, Wang Chuanlun from Zouping County wrote: "The third issue of the 'China Young Pioneers Daily' has come out, but we have only received the first issue." Xu Renzhong from Shandong Experimental Middle School wrote: "The 'China Young Pioneers Daily,' which is published every Monday, is not received until Saturday, but the 'China Youth Daily' can be received on the morning of the second day after publication." Comrades from the distribution section of the Xinyang Post Office wrote: "The fourth issue of the 'China Young Pioneers Daily,' published on November 26th, had not been received by December 6th."
    This shows that there are problems with the distribution of the "China Young Pioneers Daily." I hope that the responsible comrades of post offices in various regions will check the distribution work of the "China Young Pioneers Daily" so that the "China Young Pioneers Daily" can meet with readers in a timely manner.

    希望各地邮局改进“中国少年报”的发行工作
    编辑同志：“中国少年报”从十一月五日创刊后，到最近虽才出了八期，但它已发行到二十四万份。它已成为拥有广大读者的报纸。为了满足读者的期望，“中国少年报”每期都是提前两天付印，同时，交邮局发行，也从来没有延误过时间。
    可是，最近很多读者来信提出“不能按期收到报纸”的责难，如邹平县王传伦来信说：“中国少年报”第三期也出来了，我们才收到第一期。山东实验中学徐人忠来信说：每逢星期一出版的“中国少年报”，要到星期六才能收到，但“中国青年报”在出版后的第二天早晨就可收到。信阳邮局发行股的同志来信说：十一月二十六日出版的第四期“中国少年报”，直到十二月六日还没收到。
    这说明“中国少年报”的发行工作是有问题的。我希望各地邮局负责同志检查一下“中国少年报”的发行工作，使“中国少年报”能及时和读者见面。        中国少年报社    严达
