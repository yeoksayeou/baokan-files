    Gao Zhihua, Deputy Director of Wuji County Court in Hebei Province,
    Dismissed for Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty

    Gao Zhihua, Deputy Director of the People's Court of Wuji County, Hebei Province, has been duly punished for embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and abuse of power.

    In the winter of 1950, Gao Zhihua accepted bribes in handling cases. In one case, an arsonist should have been sentenced to eight months or more in prison, but because the arsonist gave Gao Zhihua 220 eggs and 100,000 RMB, he was only sentenced to six months. Gao Zhihua also misappropriated public funds without authorization. On one occasion, he misappropriated 1.5 million RMB for his family to do business, and on another occasion, he misappropriated 1.2 million RMB and lent it to others. Gao Zhihua also engaged in unfair transactions for his family and the court's production team. Gao Zhihua also condoned his wife's shielding of criminals. Gao Zhihua's father, Gao Luoqian, relied on his son's power in the county court to accept bribes and solicit lawsuits in his hometown of Guozhuang, abusing his power among the masses and greatly undermining the government's credibility. In order to punish criminals, the Dingxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Hebei Province has reported to the Hebei Provincial People's Supervision Committee for approval to give Gao Zhihua the punishment of dismissal from his post. His father, Gao Luoqian, has been handed over to the judicial organs for handling, and his illegally obtained property has been confiscated.

    高志华在一九五○年冬，先后在受理案件中接受贿赂。有一放火犯，本应判徒刑八个月以上，因为那个放火犯送了高志华二百二十个鸡蛋和十万元人民币，结果只判了六个月。高志华还擅自挪用公款。有一次，他挪用公款一百五十万元，给他家里作买卖，另一次又挪用了公款一百二十万元，借给别人。高志华还替他家里和法院生产组做不公平的买卖。高志华又纵容他的妻子包庇犯法分子。高志华的父亲高洛倩，倚仗他在县法院当权，在他家乡郭庄一带，接受贿赂，包揽诉讼，在群众中作威作福，使政府威信大受影响。为了惩办犯罪分子，河北省定县专员公署已报请河北省人民监察委员会核准，给高志华以撤职处分。他父亲高洛倩已被移交司法机关处理，并没收其受贿财物。
