    Further Develop and Consolidate Mutual Aid Teams in Rural North China
      Sun Ziying
    For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have lived under an individual economy, with each family being a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation for the feudal class, bureaucratic capitalism, and imperialism to rule the Chinese people, and the fundamental reason why farmers have been trapped in poverty and bankruptcy for a long time. In North China, the feudal land ownership system has been eliminated, bureaucratic capital has been overthrown, and imperialists have been driven away, which has opened up a broad road for the development of agricultural production. Although agricultural production in North China has made great progress in recent years, it basically maintains a backward mode of production. If this situation is not changed, the vast number of farmers will not be able to become prosperous, and agricultural production will be difficult to develop rapidly. The only way to change this situation is to gradually move towards collectivization through cooperatives. That is to say, in addition to organizing farmers into supply and marketing cooperatives in terms of supply and marketing, we must also attract farmers into cooperative and mutual aid organizations in terms of production. This cooperative and mutual aid organization is a collective labor organization based on private ownership, the only way for farmers to move from poverty to prosperity, the correct path to develop agricultural production at the present stage, and the necessary process to gradually overcome the decentralized and backward state of agricultural production and move towards collectivization and modernization. Therefore, we must pay attention to the work of mutual aid teams and strengthen specific leadership over mutual aid teams to make them more popular and improved.
    Mutual Aid Teams in North China Have Developed Greatly
    But Not Widespread Enough, Not Solid Enough
    Since Chairman Mao pointed out the direction of organizing to develop production in 1943, the mutual aid movement in North China has been widely developed and has a history of nearly ten years. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, the mutual aid movement played a significant role in overcoming labor and animal power difficulties, maintaining wartime production levels, ensuring military and civilian supplies, supporting large-scale wars, and rapidly restoring and developing agricultural production, healing war wounds, increasing farmers' incomes, and invigorating the rural economy in recent years. However, during a certain period, mistakes such as forced orders, violations of the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, and infringement of the interests of middle peasants were made in organizing mutual aid. After correcting these mistakes, phenomena of laissez-faire occurred in some areas. Leading organs at all levels have continuously struggled against these deviations, so mutual aid teams can still persist and develop. So far, the number of households organized in the whole region has reached more than 50 percent of the total number of farm households. There are mainly three forms of organization: The first form is temporary and seasonal small mutual aid teams, which is the most primary form. However, it is the form that is easily accepted by the largest number of masses at present and should be developed on a large scale and gradually improved. The second form is permanent and fixed mutual aid teams, which is a relatively advanced form of mutual aid teams. This kind of mutual aid team accounts for about 14 percent of the total number of mutual aid teams. Its characteristics are that it has leading cadres, production plans, and division of labor in production. Some of these teams have accumulated a certain amount of public accumulation funds and collectively owned property. They are generally combined with the improvement of technology and the development of sideline occupations, and are closely linked with supply and marketing cooperatives. They can also be developed in a planned way. The third form is agricultural production cooperatives with land and labor as shares, which is the highest form of mutual aid teams and a transitional form from New Democratic agricultural production to socialist agricultural production. At present, there are more than 70 such agricultural production cooperatives in the whole region, which should be developed appropriately in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    "Organizing is better than working alone" has been fully proved by the facts of the past few years. The superiority of any form of mutual aid team is obvious: First, organized labor has high efficiency and can be cultivated intensively. Liu Jubao, a labor model in Lucheng, Shanxi, only cultivated 25 percent of the total cultivated area three times before being organized; after being organized, it increased to 93 percent; before being organized, each mu of land was fertilized with 46 dan, now it is 92 dan. Second, organized grain production is high, and wealth increases rapidly. According to the investigation materials of four villages in four counties in Shanxi, the average yield per mu of individual households is only 1.04 shi, while the average yield per mu of members of mutual aid teams is 1.58 shi. Third, organizing can run undertakings that cannot be run by one household, such as collective reclamation, afforestation, land repair, beach repair, well digging, canal opening, collective purchase of large agricultural tools, new agricultural tools, waterwheels, and engaging in large-scale sideline occupations and transportation (these undertakings are not easy for "individual" farmers to run), which not only solves the difficulties of farmers' lack of capital and labor, but also enables idle funds and surplus labor to find a way out. Fourth, organizing can gather wisdom and benefit each other, facilitate technical division of labor according to each person's expertise, and also facilitate the research and improvement of agricultural technology. Fifth, organizing can make production more planned. Sixth, organizing facilitates political education and collectivist ideological education for farmers. These superior conditions are the main reasons for the long-term existence and development of mutual aid teams, and also a solid foundation for further development and consolidation of mutual aid teams.
    However, the development of mutual aid teams in North China is not yet widespread or balanced, and the existing mutual aid teams need to be further consolidated. According to the statistics of various provinces: the number of households organized in rural areas of Shanxi Province accounts for 55 percent of the total number of households, Hebei is 49 percent, Pingyuan is 40 percent, Chahar is 33 percent, and Suiyuan is 10 percent. There is a big difference between regions. About half of the farm households in the whole region have not been organized. Some of the existing mutual aid teams are also not solid enough. This is the basic problem existing in the current mutual aid movement in North China.
    Why is the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the old areas of North China not yet widespread or balanced, and some of the existing mutual aid teams are not solid enough? There are many reasons. For example, some areas were liberated later and have a poor work foundation; some areas have not thoroughly implemented the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit; some areas have old-fashioned formalism and have not filled the mutual aid teams with new content. But these are not fundamental reasons. The fundamental reason is that many leading comrades still have some misconceptions about organizing. They are satisfied that farmers have land after the land reform and their production enthusiasm is high, thinking that "land reform cannot be led without leadership; the masses themselves can produce, and there is no need for leadership"; or they narrowly understand organizing as only to overcome the difficulties of lack of labor and animal power, "now there is no shortage of labor and animal power, so there is no need to organize"; some only pay attention to meeting the requirements of mutual aid team members economically, and neglect to carry out collectivist ideological education for the members. The basic reason for these erroneous understandings is that they do not understand that the fundamental purpose of land reform is to develop production, and they do not understand the long-term and arduous nature of transforming the small peasant economy, so they neglect the necessity of organizing. They do not understand that farmers have land, but only have the conditions for developing production; only by organizing can production be developed more rapidly, and the production enthusiasm of farmers can be more fully utilized. Therefore, it is very wrong to be satisfied with the production enthusiasm of individual farmers and not actively advocate mutual aid and cooperation. Of course, it is also wrong to be afraid of or to attack the enthusiasm of farmers. The correct approach is to cherish the production enthusiasm of individual farmers and actively advocate mutual aid and cooperation to better exert the production enthusiasm of farmers. "Organizing to develop production" is the direction of development of rural production. Obviously, our advocacy of organizing is by no means limited to overcoming the difficulties of labor and animal power, which is only the initial purpose of the mutual aid and cooperation movement; the greater purpose is to further improve productivity, so that the individual backward mode of production is gradually changed to a collectivized and modernized mode of production, so that farmers truly live a prosperous life, and promote the rapid development of national industry and agriculture. However, because farmers have been following the old path for thousands of years, it is often not easy for them to quickly get rid of the scattered old mode of production and accept the new path of "organizing." Therefore, it is necessary to educate farmers. Lenin once said: Cooperatives are the best schools for educating farmers. We must seriously organize them, so that they can experience the benefits of organizing from actual life, and guide them towards modernized and collectivized production. This is an arduous process, a process of competition between organized farmers and individual farmers. It should not be too hasty, but it must not be relaxed. Facts have proved that production develops rapidly in places where the mutual aid foundation is good and collective ideological education is strengthened, and the production enthusiasm and political awareness of farmers have been significantly improved. But why don't some comrades understand these meanings? It is because these comrades still have conservative small peasant economic views in their minds. They do not lead farmers from the perspective of the proletariat, but lead farmers from the perspective of the small peasant economy. They lack the lofty ideals and courage to transform the small peasant economy. Therefore, they are often easily satisfied with temporary and immediate interests, and relax the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, relax the education of farmers, and in fact relax the Party's leadership over farmers. This is the fundamental reason why the development of the current mutual aid and cooperation movement is not widespread or balanced and some mutual aid teams are not solid enough. Correcting these erroneous ideas is an important part of further developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    Strive to Organize Most Men and Women
    Major Labor Force in Two or Three Years
    In order to further develop and consolidate the mutual aid and cooperation movement in North China and strive to organize most of the male and female major labor force in two or three years to meet the new production upsurge, I think we should pay attention to the following points:
    1. We must attach importance to the mutual aid and cooperation movement ideologically, earnestly study the theories and policies on mutual aid and cooperation, use the method of criticism and self-criticism to oppose various deviations that despise and distort the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and resolutely implement the policy of "organizing to develop production."
    2. The most important task of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the future is to develop on a large scale and strive for popularity, and to seek consolidation and improvement on the basis of popularity. The specific policy should be to develop simple and temporary labor mutual aid teams universally under leadership. If it is considered a primary form and is not led or valued, it is wrong; in areas with a preliminary foundation for the mutual aid movement, permanent and fixed mutual aid teams should be gradually promoted under leadership according to the voluntary nature of the masses. If we are only satisfied with temporary and seasonal mutual aid teams and do not gradually consolidate and improve them to make farmers obtain more benefits, it is also wrong. In areas with many years of mutual aid movement foundation, the masses have rich mutual aid experience, are completely voluntary, and have strong leading cadres, agricultural production cooperatives should be developed in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner. If we do not pay attention to whether there is a foundation for the mutual aid movement and whether the masses are willing, and blindly pursue advanced forms, it is also wrong. The general development process should be from small to large, from low to high, from temporary to fixed, gradually developing and improving.
    3. The central link in developing and consolidating the mutual aid and cooperation movement is to improve production efficiency. That is to say, the members of the mutual aid team must produce better, earn more income, and live a better life than "individual" farmers. This is the material basis for whether the mutual aid and cooperation movement can be developed and consolidated. In order to achieve this, we must constantly enrich the production content of the mutual aid team, find production avenues for the mutual aid team from all aspects, and solve the problems of surplus labor, animal power, and idle funds after mutual aid in a planned way. Therefore, it is very important to continue to advocate the combination of mutual aid teams with the improvement of agricultural technology and the development of sideline occupations. At present, the improvement of agricultural technology should mainly start from increasing large agricultural tools, adopting new agricultural tools, raising funds to open canals and dig wells, repairing terraced fields and beaches, improving sandy and alkaline land, implementing seed disinfection and promoting improved varieties, and improving cultivation methods. Sideline production should mainly develop promising handicrafts, processing industries, transportation industries, and cultivate fruit trees and breed livestock, and gradually implement division of labor and industry according to the development of mutual aid teams. Supply and marketing cooperatives should establish contract relationships such as sales and ordering with mutual aid teams to solve the difficulties of team members in selling agricultural and sideline products and purchasing means of production and means of livelihood.
    4. The principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be implemented. This is the basic policy for organizing mutual aid. In order to truly achieve voluntariness, we must be voluntary in joining the group and free to withdraw from the group; no exclusion or attack is allowed on farmers who are willing to "work alone." Because this is a matter of farmers' awareness and also a matter of how to treat middle peasants. For farmers, the serious problem is education; we must patiently help them, unite them, and attract them to gradually move closer to the mutual aid team with the superior facts of organization. In the implementation of the two-benefit policy, the important issue is to increase production so that team members have more income than individual farmers. It is not right to fail to pay attention to increasing production and to be preoccupied with evaluating work and recording work, or to set a set of cumbersome formalistic calculation methods. However, if we do not pay attention to evaluating work, recording work, and clearing work in the case of gradual development of production and gradual increase of mutual aid content, it will affect the consolidation of the mutual aid team. This requires the formulation of a set of simple and easy-to-implement systems.
    5. In order to overcome the difficulties of farmers' lack of capital, to prevent natural disasters and man-made disasters, and to run larger undertakings, some collectively owned property and public accumulation funds can be established under the completely conscious and voluntary conditions of the masses. If the masses do not agree, never force them. The levy ratio should not be too high, and the amount can be decided by the team members. When a team member withdraws from the team, he should have complete freedom to take out the public accumulation funds he has paid.
    6. The issue of the ratio of land and labor dividends in agricultural production cooperatives should in principle be that labor dividends should be more than land dividends; but it should not be stipulated too rigidly. The specific ratio should be discussed and decided by the members according to the specific conditions of land, sideline occupations, etc., and then gradually changed to a more reasonable ratio in the process of production development and changes in land due to processing, according to the awareness of the masses.
    7. Strengthening the political and ideological education of mutual aid team members and ordinary farmers is also one of the important conditions for the development and consolidation of mutual aid teams. We must regularly carry out patriotic education to them, encourage their patriotic enthusiasm for production, make them understand the consistency of national interests and individual interests, and cultivate their concept of loving the motherland and taking the overall situation into consideration. We must often publicize the benefits of organizing with facts, and gradually cultivate farmers' habits of collective farming and collective concepts. It is one-sided to pay attention only to meeting the economic requirements of team members without paying attention to education.
    8. Regularly and universally convening mutual aid representative meetings and discussion meetings is an important method for leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and also an important creation in North China this year. Through this kind of meeting, we can summarize and exchange experiences, solve problems, and cultivate typical examples to promote the development of mutual aid teams.
    9. It is recommended that national economic organs support mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives in all aspects; lend seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools to farmers, and provide technical guidance. Help them organize effectively.
    10. It is recommended that leading organs at all levels set up full-time personnel or appropriate leading organizations to specifically lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement, regularly arrange, check, and summarize work, and train mutual aid and cooperation cadres, team leaders, and activists. Leading comrades should maintain close contact with one village and one team and use it as a basis for creating experience to guide the general. Every Communist Party member in the countryside must actively participate in and lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement and play a leading role, and strive for a greater victory in the patriotic and abundant production movement.

    进一步发展和巩固华北农村的互助组
      孙子英
    中国农民几千年来都是过着个体经济的生活，一家一户就是一个生产单位。这种分散的个体生产，是封建阶级和官僚资本主义及帝国主义统治中国人民的经济基础，是农民长期陷于穷困破产的根本原因。华北的封建土地所有制已被消灭，官僚资本已被打倒，帝国主义者已被赶跑，这就给农业生产的发展开辟了一条康庄大道。近年来华北区的农业生产虽有很大进步，但基本上仍保持着落后的生产方式。这种状况如不改变，广大农民便不能富裕起来，农业生产也难得到迅速发展。改变这种状况的唯一办法，就是经过合作社逐渐走向集体化。就是说：除在供销方面将农民组织到供销社里以外，还要在生产上把农民吸引到合作互助的组织中去。这种合作互助组织是建立在私有基础上的集体劳动组织，是农民由穷困走向富裕的必由之路，是现阶段发展农业生产的正确道路，也是逐渐克服农业生产的分散落后状态，并走向集体化现代化的必经过程。因此，我们必须重视互助组工作，加强对互助组的具体领导，使它更加普及和提高。
    华北各地互助组已有很大发展
    但还不够普遍、不够巩固
    自从一九四三年毛主席指出组织起来发展生产的方向以后，华北地区的互助运动就有了广泛的发展，到现在已有近十年的历史。互助运动在抗日战争和解放战争中，对克服劳力、畜力困难，维持战时生产水平，保证军需民食，支援大规模战争，以及近几年来在迅速恢复与发展农业生产、医治战争创伤、增加农民收入、活跃农村经济等方面都起了重大作用。但有一个时期，在组织互助时，曾犯过强迫命令、违反了自愿互利原则和侵犯中农利益等错误；在纠正了这些错误以后，若干地区又发生了放任自流现象。各级领导机关对这些偏向进行了不断的斗争，所以互助组仍能坚持和发展起来。到目前为止，全区组织起来的户数约达总农户数的百分之五十以上。组织起来的形式主要有三种：第一种形式是临时性、季节性的小型互助组，是最初级的形式。但它在目前是为最大量的群众所容易接受的形式，应大量发展，逐步提高。第二种形式是常年固定的互助组，是互助组中较高级的形式。这种互助组约占互助组总数的百分之十四，它的特点是有领导骨干，有生产计划，有生产分工，其中有一些组并积累了一定数量的公积金和伙有财产，一般都和改良技术发展副业相结合，并和供销合作社密切联系，也可以有计划地去发展。第三种形式是土地和劳力入股的农业生产合作社，是互助组中最高级的形式，是由新民主主义农业生产到社会主义农业生产的一种过渡形式。这种农业生产合作社目前全区共有七十多个，应有计划、有步骤地适当地去发展。
    “组织起来胜过单干”，已为几年来的事实所完全证明。不论哪种形式的互助组，优越性都是很明显的：第一，组织起来劳动效率高，能精耕细作。山西潞城劳动模范刘聚保，在组织起来以前，耕三遍的土地只占总耕地面积百分之二十五；组织起来以后，就增加到百分之九十三；组织起来以前每亩地施肥四十六担，现在是九十二担。第二，组织起来打粮多，财富增加得快。据山西四个县四个村的调查材料，单干户每亩的平均产量只一点零四石，互助组的组员每亩平均产量为一点五八石。第三，组织起来能兴办一家一户不能举办的事业，如集体开荒、造林、修地、修滩、打井、开渠、伙买大农具、新式农具、水车及搞大宗的副业、运输等（这些事业“单干”农民都不容易兴办），既解决了农民资力、劳力不足的困难，同时也能使游资和剩余劳力找到出路。第四，组织起来能集思广益，取长补短，便于按每人的专长进行技术分工，也便于研究和改进农业技术。第五，组织起来能使生产比较有计划。第六，组织起来便于对农民进行政治教育和集体主义的思想教育。这些优越条件是互助组得以长期存在和发展的主要原因，也是互助组进一步发展和巩固的坚实基础。
    但是，华北区互助组的发展还不普遍不平衡，已有的互助组也须进一步加以巩固。据各省统计：山西省农村组织起来的户数占总户数的百分之五十五，河北为百分之四十九，平原为百分之四十，察哈尔为百分之三十三，绥远为百分之十。各地相差甚多。全区约有一半农户还没组织起来。已有的互助组有些也欠巩固。这就是目前华北区互助运动中存在的基本问题。
    为什么在华北老区，互助合作运动的发展还不普遍、不平衡，而且已有的互助组有些还不够巩固呢？原因是很多的。如有些地区解放较晚，工作基础较差；有的地区对自愿两利政策执行不够彻底；有的地区存在有老一套形式主义的作法，没有充实互助组以新的内容等。但这都不是根本原因。根本的原因在于有许多领导同志对组织起来还有一些错误认识。他们满足于土地改革后农民有了土地，生产情绪高涨，认为“土地改革非领导不行；生产群众自己会，用不着领导”；或把组织起来狭隘地了解成只是为了克服劳力、畜力缺乏的困难，“现在劳畜力不缺乏了就不必组织了”；有的则只注意从经济上满足互助组组员的要求，忽视了对组员进行集体主义的思想教育。产生这些错误认识的基本原因，在于他们不了解土地改革的根本目的就是为了发展生产，不了解改造小农经济的长期性，艰苦性，因此也就忽视了组织起来的必要性。他们不了解：农民有了土地，只是取得了发展生产的条件；只有组织起来，才能更迅速地发展生产，农民的生产热情也才能更充分地发挥出来。因此，满足于个体农民的生产积极性，不积极提倡互助合作，是十分错误的。当然，如果害怕或打击农民的这种积极性也是错误的。正确的作法是既要宝贵个体农民的生产积极性，又要积极提倡互助合作，以更好地发挥农民的生产积极性。“组织起来发展生产”是农村生产的发展方向。很显然，我们提倡组织起来，目的绝不只限于克服劳力、畜力的困难，这仅仅是互助合作运动的初步目的；更大的目的是进一步提高生产力，使个体的落后的生产方式逐渐改变为集体化、现代化的生产方式，使农民真正过着富裕的生活，促进国家工业农业的迅速发展。但是由于农民几千年来都是走着旧的道路，他们开始往往不易很快摆脱分散的旧的生产方式，接受“组织起来”的新道路。因此，必须对农民进行教育。列宁曾说过：合作社是对农民进行教育的最好的学校。我们要认真地组织他们，使他们从实际生活中体验到组织起来的好处，引导他们走向现代化、集体化的生产。这是一个艰苦的过程，是组织起来的农民和个体农民竞赛的过程。不可过急，但决不能放松。事实证明，凡是互助基础好和加强了集体主义教育的地方，生产就发展得快，农民的生产积极性和政治觉悟就显著地提高了一步。但是为什么有些同志不了解这些意义呢？就因为这些同志的头脑中还有保守的小农经济观点。他们不是用无产阶级的观点来领导农民，而是用小农经济的观点来领导农民。他们缺乏改造小农经济的远大理想和气魄。因此，他们往往易为暂时的、眼前的利益所满足，而放松了对互助合作运动的领导，放松了对农民的教育，实际上就是放松了党对农民的领导。这就是目前互助合作运动发展不普遍、不平衡和有些互助组还不够巩固的根本原因。纠正这些错误思想，是进一步发展互助合作运动的重要一环。
    争取两三年内把大部分男女
    主要劳动力组织起来
    为了使华北区的互助合作运动进一步地发展和巩固，并争取在两三年之内把大部分男女主要劳动力组织起来，以迎接新的生产高潮，我觉得应当注意以下几点：
    一、必须从思想上把互助合作运动重视起来，认真学习关于互助合作的理论和政策，用批评与自我批评的方法，反对各种轻视和歪曲互助合作运动的偏向，坚决贯彻“组织起来发展生产”的方针。
    二、今后互助合作运动的头等重要任务是大量发展，力求普及，在普及的基础上求得巩固和提高。具体方针应是有领导地普遍地发展简单的临时性的劳动互助组。如果认为这是初级形式便不去领导或不重视，那就是错误的；在有初步互助运动基础的地区，应根据群众自愿，有领导地逐步地推广常年固定的互助组。如果只满足于临时性的和季节性的互助组，而不去逐步加以巩固和提高，使农民获得更多利益，这也是错误的。在有多年互助运动基础，群众有丰富的互助经验，又完全自愿，并有坚强领导骨干的地区，应当有计划、有步骤、有重点地发展农业生产合作社。如果不注意互助运动有无基础和群众是否愿意，盲目追求高级形式，这也是错误的。一般的发展过程，应该是由小而大、由低级到高级、由临时到固定，逐步地发展提高。
    三、发展和巩固互助合作运动的中心一环是提高生产效率。就是说：要使互助组成员比“单干”农民生产得好，收入得多，光景过得更美。这是互助合作运动能否发展巩固的物质基础。为了作到这一点，就必须不断地充实互助组的生产内容，从各方面给互助组找寻生产门路，并有计划地解决互助起来以后剩余劳力、畜力和游资的出路。因此，继续提倡互助组与改良农业技术、发展副业相结合，就十分重要了。农业技术的改良目前主要应从增置大农具，采用新式农具，集资开渠、打井，修整梯田、滩地，改良沙地、碱地，实行种子消毒与推广良种，改良耕作方法等方面着手。副业生产主要应发展有出路的手工业、加工工业、运输业，及培养果树、繁殖家畜等，并应根据互助组的发展情况逐渐实行分工分业。供销合作社要和互助组建立推销、订购等合同关系，以解决组员推销农业、副业产品和购买生产资料与生活资料的困难。
    四、必须贯彻自愿互利的原则。这是组织互助的基本政策。为了真正作到自愿，就必须入组自愿，出组自由；对于愿意“单干”的农民，不准有任何排斥或打击。因为这是农民的觉悟问题，也是如何对待中农的态度问题。对于农民，严重的问题在于教育；要耐心地帮助他们，团结他们，并用组织起来的优越事实吸引他们逐渐向互助组靠拢。在执行两利政策上，重要的问题，在于能增加生产，使组员比单干农民有更多收入。不注意增产而斤斤于评工、记工，或空定一套繁琐的形式主义的计算方法，是不对的。但在生产逐渐发展，互助内容逐渐增加的情况下，不注意评工、记工、清工，是会影响互助组的巩固的。这就需要制定一套简单易行的制度。
    五、为了克服农民资力不足的困难，防备天灾人祸及兴办较大事业，可以在群众完全自觉自愿的条件下，建立一些伙有财产和公积金。群众如果不同意，就绝对不要勉强。征集比例不宜太多，数量可由组员议定。组员出组时，应有带出所纳公积金的完全自由。
    六、农业生产合作社中土地和劳力分红的比例问题，原则上劳力分红应多于土地分红；但不宜规定得太死。具体比例如何，应根据土地、副业等具体情况由社员讨论决定，然后在生产发展以及土地由于加工所引起的变化过程中，根据群众的觉悟，逐渐变动到更合理的比例。
    七、加强对互助组组员和一般农民的政治思想教育，也是互助组发展和巩固的重要条件之一。要经常地向他们进行爱国主义教育，鼓舞他们的爱国生产热情，使他们懂得国家利益和个人利益的一致性，培养他们的爱祖国、顾全大局的观念。要用事实经常宣传组织起来的好处，逐渐培养农民集体耕作的习惯和集体观念。不注意教育，仅仅注意从经济上满足组员要求的作法是片面的。
    八、定期普遍地召开互助代表会议和座谈会，是领导互助合作运动的重要方法，也是华北区今年的重要创造。通过这种会议，可以总结与交流经验，解决问题，培养典型，以推动互助组向前发展。
    九、建议国家经济机关要在各方面支援互助组和农业生产合作社；用种籽、肥料、农具贷给农民，并给以技术指导。帮助他们有效地组织起来。
    十、建议各级领导机关设置专人或适宜的领导机构，专门领导互助合作运动，定期布置、检查和总结工作，训练互助合作干部、组长和积极分子。领导同志应经常和一村一组取得密切联系，作为创造经验指导一般的依据。农村的每一个共产党员，都要积极参加和领导互助合作运动，并起带头作用，争取爱国丰产运动的更大胜利。
