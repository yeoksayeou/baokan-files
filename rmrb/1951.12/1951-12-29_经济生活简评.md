    Brief Comment on Economic Life

    Vigorously Promote the Advanced Experience of the Ma Liu Hai Group

    The "two and a half tunnel cycle excavation" method and scientific labor organization form created by the Ma Liu Hai Group of the Datong Coal Mine are advanced experiences worthy of promotion.

    In the production increase and economy practice movement, all coal mines should strive to implement new coal mining methods. When implementing new coal mining methods, all coal mines must also improve excavation methods. Using single tunnel excavation methods and unreasonable labor organization cannot fully exploit the potential capabilities of excavation work, and excavation efficiency can only remain at the old level. In this way, excavation work will not keep up with the needs of backfilling work; new coal mining methods cannot be implemented. Promoting the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai Group can greatly improve excavation efficiency and prepare favorable conditions for the implementation of new coal mining methods.

    Some coal mine workers only consider the speed of excavation. They believe that the Ma Liu Hai Group's excavation record is not too high, and adopting the "single tunnel excavation method" and increasing the labor intensity of workers can also catch up with the Ma Liu Hai Group's excavation record. Therefore, they do not value the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai Group. This view is wrong. Simply increasing labor intensity to improve production efficiency is the method of capitalist management of enterprises. In state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature, this practice should be criticized. The main method for state-owned enterprises to improve production efficiency is to rely on the working class, improve machinery and equipment, and improve operating methods and labor organization. The advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai Group is precisely this. Although the work of the Ma Liu Hai Group still has some shortcomings, for example, their drilling technology is not very good, and the excavation record is not very high; however, as long as the efficiency of transportation work can be gradually improved, and as long as the Ma Liu Hai Group can continue to improve operating techniques, their potential capabilities will be more fully utilized, and excavation efficiency can continue to improve.

    On October 27th, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department instructed the North China and East China Mining Bureaus to seriously study the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai Group and implement multi-tunnel rapid excavation methods. The North China and East China Mining Bureaus should conscientiously implement the instructions of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, criticize various conservative ideas, and vigorously promote the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai Group.

    Timely Summarizing and Promoting Advanced Experiences
    Is the Real Way to Rely on the Working Class

    Some leading cadres of state-owned enterprises and leading cadres of trade unions are not good at timely summarizing and promoting advanced experiences to improve production and improve enterprise management. These cadres only have a general concept of relying on the working class to run enterprises well. However, how to rely on the working class? Their thinking is not clear. Therefore, their treatment of the advanced experiences created by the working masses is merely to issue some bonuses or commend them on the blackboard newspaper. They believe that this is relying on the working class.

    Rewards and commendations are necessary, but this is not the same as truly relying on the working class. Leading cadres of factories and mines, especially trade union cadres, should promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences so that they can be mastered by the broad masses of workers. In the process of promotion, it is necessary to improve the workers' awareness, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, and constantly enrich advanced experiences so that they can play a greater role in production. This is truly relying on the working class. On this basis, rewards and commendations are meaningful. Otherwise, the so-called rewards and commendations are not relying on the working class, but relying on advanced producers individually, and cannot truly achieve the goal of improving production. The result of relying only on advanced producers individually is that the experience of advanced producers cannot be improved. After a long time, advanced producers cannot be called advanced producers anymore. This is very dangerous, and every administrative and trade union leading cadre of factories and mines should deeply recognize this point.

    经济生活简评
    大力推广马六孩小组的先进经验
    大同煤矿马六孩小组创造的“两个半孔道循环掘进”的作业方法和科学的劳动组织形式，是值得推广的先进经验。
    在增产节约运动中，各个煤矿将要努力推行新采煤法。各个煤矿在推行新采煤方法时，必须同时改进掘进方法。采用单孔道掘进方法和不合理的劳动组织，不能充分地发挥掘进工作中的潜在能力，掘进效率只能停留在旧的水平上。这样，掘进工作就赶不上回采工作的需要；新采煤法就不能实行。推广马六孩小组的先进经验，就可以大大地提高掘进效率，为实行新采煤法准备有利的条件。
    有些煤矿工作者，只从掘进速度的快慢来考虑问题。他们认为，马六孩小组的掘进纪录并不算太高，采用“单孔道掘进方法”，把工人的劳动强度提高一些，也可以赶上马六孩小组的掘进纪录。因此，他们就不重视马六孩小组的先进经验。这种看法是错误的。单纯地用增加劳动强度的办法去提高生产效率，是资产阶级管理企业的办法。在社会主义性质的国营企业中，这种作法应该受到批判。国营企业提高生产效率的主要办法，是依靠工人阶级，改进机器设备，改进操作方法和劳动组织。马六孩小组的先进经验正是如此。虽然马六孩小组的工作还有一些缺点，比如，他们的打眼技术还不很好，掘进纪录还不算很高；但是，只要运搬工作的效率能够逐步提高，只要马六孩小组能够继续改进操作技术，他们的潜在能力就会更充分地发挥出来，掘进效率就可以继续不断地提高。
    十月二十七日，中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局已指示华北、华东各矿务局，认真学习马六孩小组的先进经验，实行多孔道快速掘进办法。华北、华东各矿务局应该认真执行煤矿管理总局的指示，批判各种保守思想，大力推广马六孩小组的先进经验。及时地总结和推广先进经验
    才是真正地依靠工人阶级
    有些国营企业的领导干部，工会的领导干部，还不善于及时地总结和推广先进经验，以提高生产、改进企业管理。这些干部只有一个笼统地依靠工人阶级办好企业的概念。但是，怎样依靠工人阶级呢？他们的思想是不明确的。因此，他们对待工人群众创造的先进经验，仅仅是发些奖金，或者在黑板报上表扬一番。他们认为这就是依靠工人阶级。
    奖励和表扬是必要的，但这并不等于真正依靠了工人阶级。厂矿的领导干部，特别是工会的干部，应当及时地总结和推广先进经验，使它们为广大工人群众所掌握。在推广过程中，要提高工人的觉悟，发挥工人群众的积极性和创造性，不断地丰富先进经验，使它在生产上发挥更大的作用。这是真正地依靠工人阶级，在这个基础上，奖励和表扬才有意义。否则，所谓奖励和表扬，就不是依靠工人阶级，而是依靠先进生产者个人，就不能真正达到提高生产的目的。仅仅依靠先进生产者个人的结果，先进生产者的经验就不能提高。时间久了，先进生产者也就不能称为先进生产者了。这是十分危险的，每一个厂矿企业的行政、工会领导干部，应当深刻地认识这一点。
