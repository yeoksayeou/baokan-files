    [Report from This Newspaper] The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has decided to lead national state-owned trade enterprises in launching a production increase and economy campaign centered on accelerating capital turnover and reducing commodity circulation costs. It has set a target of saving 8 trillion yuan in capital and 3 trillion yuan in commodity circulation costs, totaling 11 trillion yuan. At the same time, it has stipulated specific production increase and economy tasks for each company and region (excluding the Northeast Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region). It is stipulated that the task of saving capital should be mainly achieved by accelerating capital turnover. Efforts should be made to significantly increase sales in 1952 compared to 1951, but without increasing capital loans from banks, so that the state can save this capital for investment in other construction projects. In terms of reducing commodity circulation costs, it is required that the saved 3 trillion yuan be turned over to the national treasury on a quarterly and monthly basis to increase state revenue. In this regard, the Ministry of Trade has specifically stipulated the tasks of reducing commodity circulation costs for each company and region: China Grain Company to reduce 565 billion yuan, China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to reduce 323 billion yuan, China Coal and Building Materials Company to reduce 245 billion yuan, China Salt Industry Company to reduce 98 billion yuan, China Native Produce Company to reduce 164 billion yuan, China Industrial Materials Company to reduce 280 billion yuan, China General Merchandise Company to reduce 566 billion yuan, China Oils and Fats Company to reduce 134 billion yuan, China Animal Products Company to reduce 84 billion yuan, China Minerals Company to reduce 69 billion yuan, China Silk Company to reduce 90 billion yuan, China Tea Company to reduce 71 billion yuan, China Petroleum Company to reduce 128 billion yuan, China Import Company to reduce 29 billion yuan, China Import and Export Company to reduce 18 billion yuan, and local trade companies, trust companies, and retail companies to reduce a total of 136 billion yuan.
    The above tasks are distributed regionally as follows: North China Region, all companies to reduce commodity circulation costs by a total of 766 billion yuan; East China Region, all companies to reduce by a total of 1.08 trillion yuan; Central and South China Region, all companies to reduce by a total of 778 billion yuan; Southwest China Region, all companies to reduce by a total of 388 billion yuan; Northwest China Region, all companies to reduce by a total of 112 billion yuan. The Ministry of Trade has also made specific provisions for each region and company regarding the task of saving capital.
