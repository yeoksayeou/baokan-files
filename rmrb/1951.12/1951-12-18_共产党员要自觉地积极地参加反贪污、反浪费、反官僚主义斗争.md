Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, after thirty years of glorious and arduous struggle, finally led the Chinese people to defeat enemies at home and abroad and achieve the great victory of the Chinese revolution. The fundamental reason why the Party led the Chinese revolution to achieve a historically great victory is that it is a party built on the solid theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism, representing the most progressive class in Chinese history—the Chinese working class. Our Party has gathered the most outstanding, most conscious, and most courageous and steadfast sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Whether on the battlefield, in labor, in various tasks, or in the prisons of the reactionaries, the majority of them have shown boundless loyalty to the revolutionary cause, closely linked with the masses, observed the Party and people's discipline, and fought bravely and firmly for the highest interests of the greatest number of people. Precisely because of this, the Chinese Communist Party has become the most advanced, most courageous, and most disciplined force of the Chinese working class, and also the most advanced force of the Chinese people. This is the general and main situation of the Party.

However, on the other hand, due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, there have appeared in the Party some people who were not highly conscious or even ideologically backward, and who, after participating in the revolution, have not truly transformed themselves. Some of them had made contributions to the revolution in the past and had shown heroism and tenacity in the struggle against class enemies and national enemies wielding guns, worthy of their heroic titles, but failed to withstand the test of victory. In the face of enemies not wielding guns, their thoughts and feelings have changed. They believe that the victory of the Chinese revolution means that the Chinese revolution has been "completed." They are not prepared to continue the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Party, but are wholeheartedly thinking of developing "private businesses" and "enjoying" (correctly speaking, stealing) the fruits of the revolutionary victory. They are arrogant and complacent, consider themselves meritorious officials, stagnate and do not seek progress, crave pleasure, and are unwilling to live a hard life anymore. These people have completely forgotten the warning issued to the entire Party by the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949: "All comrades in the Party must not be arrogant and complacent, and must not be softened by people's unprincipled flattery." They have developed selfish ideas that are completely incompatible with the thoughts of communists. This kind of thinking has made them succumb to reactionary influences of the bourgeoisie, resulting in corrupt, wasteful, degenerate behaviors. Many of them have already ruined their reputation, wasted their glorious revolutionary history, and embarked on the road to destruction. The serious fact that the corrupting influence of the bourgeoisie has invaded the revolutionary ranks, and the serious harm it has caused to our Party and the people's cause, can be illustrated by the following materials already discovered in various places.

First, some people collude with private merchants to steal state property. Deng Chi (enlisted in 1932), Director of the Personnel Office of the Northeast District Department Store, colluded with private merchants to steal various state secrets and embezzled a large amount of state property. This criminal used his birthday as an opportunity to hold large-scale "birthday celebrations," defrauding property and stealing a large amount of public money to buy shares for his son in private enterprises. Lu Xingyuan (joined the Party in 1938), Director of the Engineering Office and Head of Broadcasting Equipment Section of the East China Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, abused his power during his nine months in office, colluded with private merchants, accepted bribes, and embezzled a total of 506 million yuan of people's property calculated at current value. Lu Song, Director of the Printing Factory of the Central and Southern District Taxation Bureau, embezzled and misappropriated 450 million yuan of public funds from June last year to June this year, and accepted 8 million yuan in bribes from private merchants.

Second, some people employ counter-revolutionaries as pawns to steal state property, causing serious losses to the state. Liu Zhiyu (participated in the revolution in 1943), the former person in charge of the Enterprise Department of the Finance Department of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government in Tianjin, lost his position during the operation and production in Tianjin, embezzled and accepted bribes, and employed a translator of the Japanese military police as the business director and an American spy as the engineer, resulting in a loss of more than 837 million yuan of state property.

Third, using the name of small public units, engaging in favoritism and irregularities, and engaging in corruption and fraud. Zhang Jincai, the county magistrate of Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, arbitrarily squandered state property and illegally operated a timber factory to make profits. When the superior checked, he fabricated false accounts to conceal state property amounting to more than 710,000 catties of millet and more than 300 pieces of foreign cloth, and fraudulently claimed 36,000 catties of rice in transportation fees. After the matter was discovered, Zhang Jincai bribed county and district cadres with more than 95,000 catties of millet; gave all timber factory staff three months' salary at three times their original salary, and let the personnel who fabricated false accounts for him eat and drink for more than ten days, wasting more than 10,000 catties of millet. Chu Zhuqing, the president of the Third People's Hospital of Hebei Province, and Ma Zhirui, the pharmacist, embezzled 34 million yuan of drug money by forging drug purchase receipts.

Fourth, pursuing a degenerate and corrupt life of the bourgeoisie, completely dissolved by the reactionary thoughts and habits of the bourgeoisie. The director of a factory in Shenyang arbitrarily used the fund to buy an American car for his private use. The Party branch raised criticism, but he said that the Party branch was interfering too much. Chen Jian, former deputy director of the Central and Southern Office of the China Construction Corporation, and Jing Rui, director of the secretariat, were corrupt and degenerate, falsely reporting expenses in the name of entertaining VIPs, exceeding the regulations by an average of 448 percent per month. Jing Rui made a big show at his wedding and received a large number of gifts.

Fifth, blatantly engaging in extravagance and waste, squandering people's property. Wu Keren, deputy director of the Literature and Art Department of the Central and Southern District Culture Department, rented a house for himself while serving as the director of the People's Amusement Park, and had a total of seven people in his family: a orderly, a communicator, a nanny, a driver, a cook, a maid, and a flower caretaker.

The above are just some examples of various degenerate criminal behaviors. Some of these people have already received the punishment they deserve, and some cases are being processed. It should be pointed out that although these people are only a small number in the Party, their harm is very serious. The actions of these degenerate elements in betraying the Party, betraying the class, and betraying the people prove that the remnants of the reactionary rule style and the corrupting influence of the bourgeoisie are eroding the revolutionary ranks. Whether they are unscrupulous merchants, landlords, remnants of reactionary classes, or speculators and class alien elements who have sneaked into our ranks, they are all using their most despicable means to attack those members of the Party who lack revolutionary will. Therefore,

All Party organizations must pay serious attention to the danger of Party members and cadres being corrupted by the remnant style of reactionary rule and bourgeois ideology, resolutely expose and crack down on all acts of corruption and waste, vigorously investigate and punish corrupt and degenerate elements, and conduct profound self-education and ideological transformation work for the majority of Party members and cadres. Only in this way can we fundamentally eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucratic tendencies, so that the corrosive effects of the bad influences and bad habits of internal and external reactionaries cannot succeed. At the same time, only in this way can we rectify the discipline of the Party and the state, improve work efficiency, and transform social customs.

Some people may ask: Why is it necessary to do it so vigorously? Wouldn't it be better to rectify it in the room? Regarding this question, the successful experience of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in leading the large-scale anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has given a clear answer. The experience of the Northeast proves that it is a completely necessary and urgent task at present to fully mobilize the masses and carry out a large-scale struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Doing so can first and foremost solemnize Party life, stimulate the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and make acts of corruption and waste nowhere to hide under the supervision of the masses. The old Chinese society under reactionary rule was also a society in which corruption was rampant. Some people did not feel ashamed of corruption and waste, but proud of it. This bourgeois reactionary ideology has begun to be crushed in the mass anti-corruption struggle, and Party and non-Party cadres and the broad masses all recognize that corruption and waste are the ugliest and most shameful behaviors. Secondly, through the democratic inspection movement inside and outside the Party, some erroneous tendencies existing in the leading organs at all levels, such as insufficient Marxist-Leninist education, disregard of politics, lack of criticism and self-criticism, loose organization, especially serious tendencies of bureaucracy and liberalism, can be thoroughly exposed. People gradually deeply realize that liberalism and bureaucracy are the shelter of corruption and waste, and the root cause of the existence and development of corruption and waste. Party and non-Party cadres will further improve their political enthusiasm and their sense of responsibility to the Party and the people in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. This will directly help to establish a democratic system in the future in the organs and Party life, strengthen the supervisory role of the masses inside and outside the Party on the leading organs and leading cadres from the perspective of care, and eliminate all possibilities of corruption and waste. Finally, in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the broad masses are increasingly strengthening their support for Party organizations. People who used to have doubts about whether the Communist Party would become corrupt now believe that "the Communist Party will never become corrupt" and that "China truly has a future." They see that the decisive role in the Party is played by the majority of good Party members, they see that a large number of outstanding cadres of our Party are closely united around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and they will further deeply realize that the Communist Party is a Party that holds the weapons of Marxist-Leninist criticism and self-criticism. Under any circumstances, the Party can adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, and is not afraid to criticize and expose its own existing shortcomings, even quite serious ones, and expose these shortcomings to the entire Party and the people of the whole country, formulate methods, and resolve to correct them. On the basis of criticism and self-criticism, the relationship between the Party and the masses will be further strengthened, so that the broad masses will believe in the Party more, love the Party, and resolve to follow the Party together.

Now, a large-scale anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle is gradually unfolding throughout the country. Every Communist Party member must participate in this intense political struggle without exception, and resolutely and bravely crush all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Every Party member and revolutionary cadre must be determined to transform themselves in the struggle, and strive to further purify the Party organization and raise the standard of Communist Party members. Here, let us firmly remember the valuable instructions given to us by Chairman Mao in his article "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War":

"Communist Party members should be models of integrity in government work, not using private individuals, doing more work, and taking less remuneration. Communist Party members should be friends of the people in mass movements, not superiors of the people, teachers who are tireless in teaching, not bureaucratic politicians. Communist Party members should never put personal interests first at any time or place, and personal interests should be subordinate to the interests of the nation and the masses. Therefore, selfishness, passive laziness, corruption, and pursuit of the limelight are the most contemptible. The spirit of selflessness, active effort, self-denial, and hard work is the model worthy of respect."

### 共产党员要自觉地积极地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争

    共产党员要自觉地积极地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争
    中国共产党在毛泽东同志领导下，经过了三十年光荣的艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于领导中国人民战胜了国内外敌人，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利。党领导中国革命获得历史上伟大胜利的根本原因，是因为它是建立在马克思列宁主义的巩固的理论基础上的、代表中国历史上最进步的阶级——中国工人阶级的党。在我们党内集中了中华民族最优秀、最有觉悟、最勇敢坚定的儿女。他们不论在战场上，在劳动中，在各种工作中，以及在反动派的监牢里，大多数都对革命事业表现了无限忠心，紧密联系群众，遵守党和人民的纪律，勇敢坚定，为最大多数人民的最高利益而艰苦奋斗。也正因为这样，中国共产党就成了中国工人阶级最先进、最勇敢、最有纪律的部队，同时也是中国人民最先进的部队，这是党的总的情况和主要情况。
    但在另一方面，由于中国革命获得了胜利，在党内却出现了这样一些人，他们有的原来觉悟不高甚至思想落后，参加革命之后，并未真正改造自己。有的是过去对革命曾有所贡献，在同拿枪的阶级敌人、民族敌人斗争中，曾经表现了英勇顽强，不愧自己的英雄称号，但是没有经得起胜利的考验，在不拿枪的敌人面前，他们的思想感情发生了变化。他们认为中国革命胜利就是中国革命业已“完成”，他们不是准备在党的领导下继续进行革命斗争，而是一心一意想发展“私人事业”，“享受”（正确地说是盗窃）革命胜利的果实。他们骄傲自满，以功臣自居，停顿起来不求进步，贪图享乐，不愿再过艰苦生活。这些人完全忘记了一九四九年中国共产党第七届二中全会向全党所提出的“全党同志不要骄傲自满，不要被人们的无原则的捧场所软化”的警告。他们发展了同共产党人的思想完全不能相容的自私自利的思想，这种思想，使他们屈服于资产阶级反动影响之下，产生了贪污浪费堕落腐化的行为。其中有不少的人已经身败名裂，断送了自己的光荣的革命历史，走上了毁灭的道路。资产阶级的腐化影响侵入革命队伍的这个严重事实，和由此所造成的对于我们的党和人民事业的严重危害，可以从各地已经发现的下列一部分材料中得到说明。
    第一、有些人勾结私商，盗窃国家财产。东北区百货公司人事室主任邓赤（一九三二年入伍），勾结私商，盗窃国家机密多种，贪污大批国家财产。该犯利用生日，大规模地“做寿”，骗取财物，并窃夺公家大量金钱，替儿子在私人企业中入股。华东、上海人民广播电台工务室主任兼广播器材科科长路星元（一九三八年入党）在任职九个月中，利用职权，勾结私商，接受贿赂，先后贪污人民财产按目前价值计算达五亿零六百余万元。中南区税务局印刷厂厂长陆松，在去年六月至今年六月中，贪污舞弊侵吞公款达四亿五千万元，接受私商贿赂八百万元。
    第二、有些人任用反革命分子作为窃取国家财产的爪牙，使国家遭受严重损失。辽东省人民政府财政厅企业处前在天津经营生产的负责人刘治宇（一九四三年参加革命），在天津经营生产过程中，丧失立场，贪污受贿，任用日本宪兵队的翻译当营业主任，任用美国间谍当工程师，致使国家财产损失了八亿三千七百多万元。
    第三、利用小公家名义，假公济私，营私舞弊。山西省交城县县长张进才任意挥霍国家财产，并非法经营木材工厂，从中取利。当上级检查时，他竟捏造假账，隐瞒国家财产达小米七十一万余斤，洋布三百余匹，并冒领运费三万六千斤米。事情被发觉后，张进才先后用小米九万五千多斤，贿赂县、区干部；给木厂工作人员一律按原薪三倍加薪三个月，并让替他造假账的人员大吃大喝十余天，浪费小米一万余斤。河北省立第三人民医院院长楚竹青和司药员马芝瑞，用假造购药单据的办法，贪污了药款三千四百万元。
    第四、追求资产阶级堕落腐化的生活，完全被资产阶级反动思想习惯所溶化。沈阳某工厂厂长擅自动用基金，买美国汽车，供其私用。党的总支提出批评，他反说总支管的太多了。原中国建筑公司中南办事处副主任谌剑和秘书主任竞锐，腐化堕落，借招待贵宾为名，浮报开支，每月平均超出规定百分之四百四十八。竞锐结婚时大摆场面，收进大量礼物。
    第五、明目张胆地铺张浪费，挥霍人民财产。中南区文化部文艺处副处长武克仁在其任民众乐园管理处处长职内，一个人租了一幢房屋，家里用了一个勤务员，一个通讯员，一个保姆，一个司机，一个厨师，一个娘姨和一个看花的，共达七人之多。
    以上这些，只不过是各种堕落犯罪行为中的一些例子。这些人，有的已经受到应得的制裁，有些人的案件正在处理。应当指出：这些人在党内虽不过是一小撮，但是他们的为害，却很严重。这些堕落分子背叛党、背叛阶级、背叛人民的行为，证明反动统治的残余作风和资产阶级的腐化影响正在侵蚀革命的队伍。无论是奸商也好，地主也好，反动阶级的残余分子也好，以及混进到我们队伍来的投机分子、阶级异己分子也好，都在施展他们最卑鄙的手段，向着党内缺乏革命意志的分子进攻。因此，
    一切党的组织，必须严重注意党员、干部被反动统治的残余作风和资产阶级思想意识所腐化的危险，坚决地揭露和打击一切贪污浪费的行为，大张旗鼓地检查和惩治贪污蜕化分子，对广大党员干部进行深刻的自我教育和思想改造的工作。只有这样，才能从根本上肃清贪污浪费和官僚主义倾向，使内外反动派的坏影响坏习惯的腐蚀作用无从得逞。同时也只有这样，才能整饬党和国家的纪律，提高工作效率，转移社会风气。
    也可能有人问：何必这样大张旗鼓呢？关在屋子里整岂不是更好一些吗？关于这一个问题，中共中央东北局所领导的大张旗鼓地反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的成功经验，已经给了明确的回答。东北的经验证明：充分发动群众，大张旗鼓地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，在目前是一个完全必要的、紧迫的任务。这样做首先可以严肃党的生活，激发群众的革命积极性，使贪污浪费的行为在群众监督之下无处容身。反动派统治下的旧中国社会，也就是贪污盛行的社会，一部分人对于贪污浪费，不以为耻，反以为荣。这种资产阶级反动思想，在群众性的反贪污斗争中，开始受到粉碎性的打击，党和非党干部以及广大群众都公认贪污浪费是最丑恶、最可耻的行为。其次，经过党内外的民主检查运动，可以彻底地揭发存在于各级领导机关的某些错误倾向，如马列主义教育进行的不够，不问政治，缺乏批评和自我批评，组织不严密，特别是官僚主义和自由主义等严重倾向。人们逐渐深刻地认识到自由主义和官僚主义是贪污、浪费的庇护所，是贪污、浪费得以存在和发展的根本原因。党和非党干部在反官僚主义斗争中，将进一步提高政治积极性和对党对人民的负责精神。这对于在今后机关的和党的生活中建立民主制度，加强党内外群众对领导机关和领导干部从爱护观点出发的监督作用，以及杜绝一切贪污浪费的可能性，会发生直接的帮助。最后，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，广大群众正日益加强对于党的组织的拥护。过去对共产党“会不会腐化”抱有怀疑的人，现在才相信“共产党永远不会腐化”，才相信“中国真是有前途”。他们看到在党内起决定作用的是大多数的好党员，他们看到我们党的大批优秀干部紧密团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的周围，他们将更进一步深刻地认识共产党是掌握着马列主义批评和自我批评武器的党，党在任何情况下都能坚持真理，修正错误，不怕批评和揭露自己还存在着的、那怕是相当严重的缺点，并把这些缺点暴露在全党和全国人民面前，订出办法，决心把它纠正。在批评和自我批评的基础上，党同群众的关系必将进一步加强。使广大人民更加相信党，热爱党，决心跟随着党一同前进。
    现在，全国范围内大规模的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争已逐步展开。每一个共产党员都要毫无例外地参加到这一场紧张的政治斗争中去，坚决地勇敢地粉碎一切贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象。每一个党员和革命干部都要在斗争中下定决心，改造自己。为进一步纯洁党的组织而斗争，为提高共产党员标准而斗争。在这里，让我们牢牢记住毛主席在“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”一文中给我们的宝贵指示：
    “共产党员在政府工作中，应该是十分廉洁，不用私人，多做工作，少取报酬的模范。共产党员在民众运动中，应该是民众的朋友，而不是民众的上司，是诲人不倦的教师，而不是官僚主义的政客。共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，个人利益服从于民族的群众的利益。因此，自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的。而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干等等精神，才是值得尊敬的模范。”
