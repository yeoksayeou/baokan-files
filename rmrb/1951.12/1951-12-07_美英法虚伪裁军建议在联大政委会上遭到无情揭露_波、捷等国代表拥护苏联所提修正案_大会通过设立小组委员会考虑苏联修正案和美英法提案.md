(Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 5th) The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its meetings from November 26th to 30th, holding general debate on the so-called "regulation, limitation, and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments" proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, and France, and the amendments to this proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation. Representatives of the United States, Britain, and France tried their best to quibble about their proposals at the meeting, but they failed to overturn the arguments put forward by the Soviet delegation, nor were they able to force the mechanical majority in the United Nations to obediently pass their proposals. When the Political Committee concluded its debate on this issue on November 30th, it did not ultimately vote on the US, British, and French proposal, but unanimously adopted the suggestion put forward by the representatives of Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, to organize a four-nation subcommittee of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to simultaneously consider the US, British, and French proposal and the Soviet amendments.

　　The Soviet delegation's amendments to the US, British, and French proposal were put forward by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, in a long speech to the Political Committee on November 24th. The Soviet delegation first suggested revising the preamble to the three-nation proposal, which defined the main purpose, to clearly state: acknowledging "the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, the prohibition of the production of atomic weapons, and the establishment of strict international supervision of compliance with this prohibition, and the reduction of other types of armaments and armed forces of the five major powers, the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union, by one-third within one year after the General Assembly passes this resolution, based on the situation at the time of the aforementioned resolution," is the primary task. The Soviet delegation proposed including the following suggestion in the main text of the proposal as the first item: "The General Assembly believes that the use of atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and mass slaughter of mankind violates the conscience and honor of all peoples and is incompatible with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations, and therefore declares an unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition. The General Assembly instructs the Atomic Energy Commission and the Conventional Armaments Commission to draft a draft convention and submit it to the Security Council for review before February 1, 1952. This convention should stipulate measures to ensure the implementation of the General Assembly's decisions regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons, the cessation of the production of atomic weapons, the use of already manufactured atomic bombs only for civilian purposes, and the establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of the aforementioned convention." In its amendments, the Soviet delegation suggested the establishment of an international control agency under the Security Council (whose authority is to supervise the implementation of the ban on atomic weapons and to supervise the reduction of various armaments and armed forces), and authorized the aforementioned international control agency to collect materials on various armed forces (including paramilitary forces, security forces, and police) and materials on all armaments, including atomic weapons; it also advocated effective international inspection based on the decisions of this control agency. The Soviet amendment stipulated that the General Assembly should instruct this agency to inspect all facilities for the manufacture and storage of atomic weapons immediately after the conclusion of the convention banning atomic weapons, in order to check the implementation of the aforementioned convention. The Soviet delegation also suggested that the General Assembly invite all countries, whether members of the United Nations or non-members, to hold a world conference in the near future (in any case, no later than June 1, 1952) to consider the issue of substantial reduction of armed forces and armaments, as well as practical measures to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition. The purpose of the Soviet amendments to the three-nation proposal was to ensure that the General Assembly's decisions could truly guarantee the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes.

　　This concise and clear amendment by the Soviet delegation forced the representatives of the US-British bloc to clearly and unambiguously state their true intentions. At the meeting on the 26th, French representative Moch, representing the United States, Britain, and France, expressed preliminary opinions on the Soviet amendments. He could only repeat the anti-Soviet slander often heard in American propaganda, and could not put forward any arguments to refute the definition of the policies of the United States, Britain, and France put forward by the Soviet representative—policies of aggression and aggravation of international tensions. In this way, the representatives of the three countries obviously could not put forward any powerful arguments to defend themselves.

　　At the same meeting, Indian representative Rau stated that any plan to reduce armaments would not lead to actual disarmament and abolition of arms unless accepted by all major powers. The Iraqi representative then spoke, saying that the committee could only find a solution to the issues under discussion based on an agreement that the four major powers could accept. Therefore, he, on behalf of the delegations of Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, proposed the establishment of a subcommittee composed of the President of the General Assembly and representatives of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to "formulate suggestions in order to reach agreement on the following issues: the issue of supervising armed forces and armaments, the issue of supervising the reduction of armed forces and armaments, and the issue of supervising the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction." The subcommittee must consider both proposals - the US, British, and French proposal and the Soviet amendments.

　　At the meeting on the 28th, British representative Lloyd, in responding on behalf of the three countries to the questions raised by Vyshinsky in his speech on November 24th regarding disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, deliberately equivocated and avoided making clear and specific answers. After futilely attempting to prove that the three-nation proposal provided the necessary measures for reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, Lloyd had to state that the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France supported the suggestion of holding a four-nation subcommittee to seek an agreement on a mutually acceptable basis.

　　In subsequent meetings, representatives of Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and Czechoslovakia spoke one after another, ruthlessly exposing the true intention of the US, British, and French proposal to deceive the people in order to conceal their conspiracy to expand armaments and prepare for war, and unanimously supported the Soviet delegation's amendments. The head of the Polish delegation, Wierblowski, cited the opinion of American bourgeois public opinion to prove that the United States launched the so-called "peace offensive" only because of fear of the sentiment of the people of all countries against war and their desire for peace. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Baranovsky, pointed out that the reason why the issue of reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons has not been able to pass in the United Nations is the attitude of the United States, Britain, and France—they have always adopted a policy hostile to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Belarusian representative Kiselev said that the fundamental reason for the United States' refusal to ban atomic weapons is that they want to use atomic weapons in the new war they are preparing for. He pointed out that only the path prescribed by the Soviet Union can guarantee the elimination of the threat of another war and make it possible to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

　　Representatives of Afghanistan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, India, Mexico, and most Latin American countries spoke at the meeting, supporting the suggestion of establishing a four-nation subcommittee. The Egyptian representative said in his speech that his last speech in the Political Committee suggesting that the atomic bomb be declared illegal had aroused attacks from some delegations and some French newspapers, but he was not disturbed by this. He believes that the prohibition of the atomic bomb is an urgent task, and solving this problem can alleviate the threat of a new war.

　　The meeting on November 30th concluded the general debate on the three-nation proposal. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a speech at the meeting, summarizing some of the results of the Political Committee's discussion, and putting forward further solutions to the issues of reducing armaments and armed forces, prohibiting atomic weapons, and implementing strict international supervision of the implementation of this prohibition. Vyshinsky first refuted the various fabrications and disgusting attacks on the Soviet Union issued by the United States and its vassal states. He pointed out that, as Jessup said, the three-nation proposal is a continuation of the approach taken by the United States, Britain, and France at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference. The attitude of the three countries is still the same, and there is no question of reducing armaments and armed forces at all. Vyshinsky analyzed the various arguments of the representatives of the three countries and proved that their suggestions did not stipulate the prohibition of atomic weapons, nor did they stipulate the implementation of genuine reduction of armaments, but only stipulated a phased investigation of armaments. He said that the Soviet delegation put forward this amendment because the Soviet Union firmly hoped, in accordance with the demands of all peace-loving people, to realize the reduction of armaments and armed forces, prohibit atomic weapons, and establish effective international supervision for the implementation of the prohibition. The Soviet delegation believes that there is a great divergence between the Soviet Union's attitude and the attitude of the United States, Britain, and France on these issues. However, the Soviet delegation is willing to continue its efforts and participate in the work of the proposed subcommittee. Vyshinsky concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation believes that the amendments it has put forward will facilitate the smooth resolution of the tasks facing the General Assembly for the benefit of the people of all countries who yearn for world peace.

　　US representative Jessup spoke last. Forced to a dead end by Vyshinsky's irrefutable arguments, he could only clumsily attempt to deny that the United States, Britain, and France had opposed raising the issue of disarmament at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference, but his words only confirmed that the representatives of the three countries wanted to replace this acute issue with empty talk about "armament levels." Jessup finally had to express his support for the suggestion of establishing a four-nation subcommittee.

　　The meeting finally unanimously adopted the suggestion put forward by the delegations of Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria to establish a four-nation subcommittee of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to simultaneously consider the three-nation proposal and the Soviet amendments.

    美英法虚伪裁军建议在联大政委会上遭到无情揭露
    波、捷等国代表拥护苏联所提修正案
    大会通过设立小组委员会考虑苏联修正案和美英法提案
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会自十一月二十六日到三十日继续举行会议，就美、英、法三国提出的所谓“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的提案和苏联代表团对这个提案所提出的修正案进行一般辩论。美、英、法三国代表在会议上曾竭力为他们的提案进行狡辩，但是没有能推翻苏联代表团所提出的论据，也没有能迫使联合国内的机械多数顺从地通过它们的提案。当政治委员会在十一月三十日结束对这个议案的辩论时，最终并没有对美、英、法三国提案进行表决，而一致通过了伊拉克、巴基斯坦、叙利亚三国代表团所提出的建议，要组织美、英、法、苏四国小组委员会来同时考虑美、英、法提案和苏联修正案。
    苏联代表团对美、英、法提案的修正案，是苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十一月二十四日向政治委员会发表长篇演说时提出的。苏联代表团首先建议修改确定主要宗旨的三国提案的序言，以明确地说明：承认“无条件禁止原子武器、禁止原子武器的生产并对遵守这种禁令建立严格的国际监督，以及在大会通过此项决议后一年内把美、英、法、中、苏五大国的其他类型的军备和武装部队按照通过上述决议时的情况裁减三分之一”，是首要的任务。苏联代表团提议将下列建议列入提案正文作为第一项：“大会认为把原子武器当作侵略的武器和大批屠杀人类的武器来使用，是违反各国人民的良知和荣誉的，是与联合国会员国的资格不相容的，因此宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立严格的国际管制，以监督这一禁令的执行。大会责成原子能委员会和常规军备委员会草拟公约草案，在一九五二年二月一日以前提交安全理事会审议。这个公约中要规定一些措施，确保大会关于禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、把已经制成的原子弹只用于民用目的以及建立严格的国际管制以监督上述公约的执行情形的各项决定得以执行。”苏联代表团在其修正案中建议成立隶属于安全理事会的国际管制机构（其职权为监督原子武器禁令的实施和监督裁减各种军备和武装部队），并授权上述国际管制机构搜集关于各种武装部队（包括半军事部队、保安部队和警察在内）的材料以及包括原子武器在内的一切军备的材料；也主张根据这个管制机构的决定来进行有效的国际视察。苏联的修正案规定大会训令这个机构在缔结禁止原子武器公约后立即视察一切制造和存储原子武器的设备，以检查上述公约的执行情形。苏联代表团并建议大会邀请一切国家，不管是联合国会员国还是非会员国，在最近将来（无论如何不迟于一九五二年六月一日）举行世界会议，考虑大量裁减武装部队和军备的问题，以及禁止原子武器和建立国际管制以监督这一禁令的执行的实际措施。苏联对三国提案提出的修正案，其目的是要使大会的决定真正能保证裁减军备和禁止把原子能用于军事目的。
    苏联代表团这个简洁明确的修正案，使得美英集团各国的代表们必须明白地、毫不含糊地说明它们的真正意图。在二十六日会议上，法国代表莫克代表美、英、法三国发表对苏联修正案的初步意见。他只能重复美国宣传中常常听到的反苏谰言，而不能提出任何论据来反驳苏联代表对美、英、法三国政策所下的定义——侵略的及使国际紧张局势更加恶化的政策。这样，三国代表显然不能提出什么为自己辩护的有力论据。
    在同天的会议上，印度代表劳氏发言指出：任何裁减军备计划，除非一切大国都接受了，否则决不会导致实际的裁军及废除武装。伊拉克代表接着发言说，只有根据四大国都能接受的协议，委员会才有可能对讨论中的问题求得解决。因此，他代表伊拉克、巴基斯坦和叙利亚三国代表团提出建议：成立由大会主席和美、英、苏、法四国代表组成的小组委员会，来“拟订建议，以便就下列问题达成协议，即：监督武装部队和军备的问题，监督武装部队和军备之裁减的问题，监督原子武器和其他大规模杀人的武器之禁止的问题”。小组委员会对于双方提案——美、英、法提案和苏联的修正案——都必须加以考虑。
    在二十八日会议上，英国代表劳埃德在代表三国答复维辛斯基在十一月二十四日演说中所提出的关于裁军和禁止原子武器的问题时，故意含糊其辞，避免作明确而具体的答复。劳埃德在徒劳无功地企图证明三国提案提供了裁减军备和禁止原子武器的必要措施以后不得不表示：美、英、法三国代表团支持举行四国小组委员会，以便在彼此都能接受的基础上求得协议的建议。
    在连日会议上，波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克代表相继发言，对美、英、法三国提案欺骗人民以掩饰它们扩军备战阴谋的真正意图予以无情的揭露，并一致拥护苏联代表团的修正案。波兰代表团团长威尔勃洛夫斯基引用了美国资产阶级的舆论，证明美国发动所谓“和平攻势”，只是由于害怕各国人民反对战争、热望和平的情绪。乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基指出：裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题在联合国一直没有能够通过，其中的障碍就是美、英、法三国的态度——它们一直采取敌视苏联和人民民主国家的政策。白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫说，美国拒绝禁止原子武器的根本原因，是他们想要正在准备的新战争中使用原子武器。他指出：只有苏联所规定的道路能够保证消除另一次战争的威胁，并使得和平利用原子能成为可能。
    阿富汗、印尼、沙特阿拉伯、菲律宾、印度、墨西哥和拉丁美洲多数国家的代表都在会上发言，赞成成立四国小组委员会的建议。埃及代表发言时说，他上次在政治委员会发言建议宣布原子弹为非法，曾引起某些代表团和部分法国报纸的攻击，但是他并没有因此而有所不安。他认为禁止原子弹是迫切的任务，解决这个问题，就可以减轻新战争的威胁。
    十一月三十日的会议结束了关于三国提案的一般辩论。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在会上发表演说，总结了政治委员会讨论的某些结果，并对有关裁减军备与武装部队、禁止原子武器以及对这种禁令的实施实行严格的国际监督的问题提出进一步的解决办法。维辛斯基首先驳斥美国及其附庸国家代表们所发出的对于苏联的各种捏造谎言和令人生厌的攻击。他指出：正如耶塞普所说，三国提案是美、英、法在巴黎外长助理会议上所采取的方针的延续。现在三国的态度还是一样，根本谈不到什么裁减军备和武装部队。维辛斯基分析了三国代表的种种论据，证明他们的建议没有规定禁止原子武器，也没有规定实行真正的裁减军备，而只是规定分阶段地调查军备。他说：苏联代表团提出这个修正案，是由于苏联坚决地希望按照全体爱好和平人民的要求，实现裁减军备和武装部队，禁止原子武器，并为禁令的执行建立有效的国际监督。苏联代表团认为在这些问题上苏联的态度和美、英、法三国的态度之间有很大的分歧。但是，苏联代表团愿意继续努力，参加拟议中的小组委员会的工作。维辛斯基最后说：苏联代表团相信它所提出的修正案，将便于为了渴望世界和平的各国人民的利益而顺利解决大会面临的任务。
    美国代表耶塞普最后发言，他被维辛斯基的无可辩驳的论据逼得走头无路，只能笨拙地企图否认美、英、法三国曾在巴黎外长助理会议上反对提出裁军问题，但是他的话恰好证实了三国代表想要用关于“军备水平”的空谈来代替这个尖锐的问题。耶塞普最后不得不表示支持关于成立四国小组委员会的建议。
    会议最后一致通过了伊拉克、巴基斯坦、叙利亚三国代表团所提出的成立美、英、苏、法四国小组委员会来同时考虑三国提案和苏联修正案的建议。
