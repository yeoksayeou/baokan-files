    Huludao Sulfuric Acid Plant's Sulfuric Acid Workshop Workers and Technicians Work Closely Together to Complete the Annual Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

    Editor: The sulfuric acid workshop of the Huludao Sulfuric Acid Plant in western Liaoning completed its annual production task 49 days ahead of schedule on November 12th, and overfulfilled the plan by producing wealth for the country equivalent to 2,745 tons of grain. The reason why the sulfuric acid workshop was able to achieve such results is mainly because the workers, under the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, fully exerted their patriotic enthusiasm. In addition, the close combination of workers and technicians improved the operating methods, thus continuously increasing production volume. The biggest difficulty in the sulfuric acid workshop is the issue of shutdown for maintenance. From May 8th to 10th, the sulfuric acid workshop had to shut down for three days for maintenance due to increased filter resistance, resulting in a loss of 900 million RMB. Later, through collaborative research between technicians and workers, it was understood that to solve the problem of resistance not increasing, the gas refining efficiency must be further improved. Old worker Gong Wenhan came up with the method of adding a dust outlet and increasing the number of dust removals, so that most of the dust contained in the gas settled. Technicians also came up with methods such as frequently releasing dilute acid from the intermediate tower and increasing the voltage. Through the efforts of the workers, the filter resistance was guaranteed not to increase, laying a good foundation for overfulfilling the annual task. Now, the sulfuric acid workshop is enthusiastically striving to increase production by another 2,000 tons of grain by the end of the year.

    葫芦岛硫酸厂制酸车间工人和技术人员密切结合
    提前超额完成全年生产计划
    编辑同志：辽西葫芦岛硫酸厂制酸车间，在十一月十二日提前四十九天完成了全年生产任务，并超计划为国家增产了价值二千七百四十五吨粮食的财富。制酸车间所以能得到这样的成绩，主要是因为职工在抗美援朝的爱国主义教育下，充分发挥了爱国热情，另外是因为工人和技术人员的密切结合，改进了操作方法，因此，使生产量不断提高。制酸车间最大的困难，是停工检修问题。五月八日到十日，制酸车间因过滤器阻力上涨，曾停工检修三天，损失了人民币九亿元。后来因为技术人员和工人的合作研究，知道了要解决阻力不涨问题，必须把气体的精制效率再提高一步。老工人龚文汉想出了增设出尘口以及打尘时增加次数的办法，使气体内所含的灰尘大部沉淀；技术人员也想出了中间塔经常往外放稀酸和增加电压等办法。经过职工的努力，保证了过滤器阻力不增大，对超额完成全年任务打下了良好的基础。现在，制酸车间正在热烈地为争取到年底再增产二千吨粮食奋斗。
