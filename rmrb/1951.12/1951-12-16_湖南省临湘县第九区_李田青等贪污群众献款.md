    Hunan Province, Linxiang County, Ninth District
    Li Tianqing and Others Embezzle Mass Donations
    
    Editor: Li Tianqing, the militia squad leader of Zhujia Village, Shitian Township, Ninth District of Linxiang County, Hunan Province, and Zhu Jingbo, the secretary of the village people's government (formerly a puppet Bao head), embezzled more than 8 million yuan of donations from the masses. After learning about this, the comrades of the land reform work team asked them to hand over the funds in full. However, Li and Zhu actually borrowed 6 million yuan from the Baiyangtian People's Bank under the guise of "the suffering of the masses" to replace it. They not only embezzled donations from the masses but also engaged in deceptive tactics, which is a criminal act. In addition, Yao Fucheng, the third militia squad leader of Liuchang Township, Ninth District, privately used mass donations to pay for his gold teeth, which is also extremely bad. We hope that the relevant leading organs will quickly deal with the above situation.

    湖南省临湘县第九区
    李田青等贪污群众献款
    编辑同志：湖南省临湘县九区石田乡朱家村民兵分队长李田青和村人民政府秘书朱经伯（原伪保长），贪污群众捐献的款项八十多万元。土地改革工作组的同志们知道这件事以后，要他们把款项如数交出。但李、朱二人竟假借“群众疾苦”名义，在白羊田人民银行借了六十万元来顶替。他们既私吞群众献款，又玩弄欺骗手段，这是一种犯罪行为。另外，九区柳厂乡第三村民兵班长姚富成，私自动用群众献款，作为自己镶金牙的费用，也是极恶劣的。以上情况，希望有关领导机关迅速处理。
