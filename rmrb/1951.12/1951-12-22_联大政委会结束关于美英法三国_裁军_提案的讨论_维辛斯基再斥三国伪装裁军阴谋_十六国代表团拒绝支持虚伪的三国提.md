Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 21st: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded on December 19th its work, which began on November 19th, of discussing the proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, and France for "regulating, limiting, and balancing the reduction of all armed forces and all armaments" and the amendments to this proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation.

At the December 14th meeting of the Political Committee, U.S. Representative Jessup presented the proposal as revised by the United States, Britain, and France. Jessup said that the drafters of the three-nation proposal had made some modifications to the content of the proposal based on the agreement reached on some points by the four-nation subcommittee of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. However, even Jessup himself admitted that these modifications only eliminated differences on some minor issues. The fundamental differences on the substantive parts of the issues under discussion were still not resolved. Jessup also stated at the meeting on the 15th that this proposal by the United States, Britain, and France must serve as the basis for the work of the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission.

In the days of meetings following the 14th, representatives of many countries spoke out against the three-nation proposal. The Polish representative said that the revised three-nation proposal has all the major shortcomings of the previous proposal, so it cannot be taken as a guideline for the work of the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission. The revised three-nation proposal does not mention the prohibition of atomic weapons, nor does it mention that the five major powers should reduce their armaments and armed forces by one-third within a year. The Polish representative said: The Syrian representative said that efforts must be continued to reach an agreement on the issues under discussion. This is not only the opinion of the Syrian representative, but many other delegations have the same opinion. Therefore, the United States should not force the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission to accept its plan in advance. The United States' attempt to force the committee to accept the three-nation proposal as the basis for its work means abandoning efforts to reach an agreement among the four countries. The Polish delegation believes that only by passing the Soviet amendments can a sound and concrete foundation be created for the future work of the committee. The Polish representative suggested that both the three-nation proposal and the Soviet amendments be submitted to the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission for review.

Representatives from Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Czechoslovakia also spoke at the meeting, exposing the essence of the three-nation proposal and warmly supporting the Soviet amendments.

The Egyptian representative said that the three-nation proposal ignores the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons, which is the most important issue. Countries that believe they have an advantage in atomic armaments certainly want to maintain atomic weapons and use them as a tool to exert pressure on other countries, and therefore oppose the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Egyptian representative pointed out that the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons must be resolved without delay. He suggested that the General Assembly should make the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction its main task, and instruct the General Assembly's Legal Committee to draft an agreement to prohibit atomic weapons during this session of the General Assembly.

The Pakistani representative said that the activities of the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission can only be successful if it first does not adopt resolutions based on unilateral demands and wishes. Only an agreement reached on a basis that is acceptable to all four major powers is effective.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky made a lengthy speech at the meeting on the 18th, in which he forcefully demonstrated that the revised three-nation proposal, like the previous proposal, attempts to replace the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons with a suggestion to collect information on armaments and armed forces. He pointed out that the current three-nation proposal cannot meet the hopes of peace-loving people, and is therefore not suitable as a basis for the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission to formulate proposals based on principles acceptable to all parties concerned. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation supports the Egyptian representative's suggestion that the United Nations General Assembly should unconditionally prohibit the use of atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction; the Soviet delegation also supports the Polish representative's suggestion that the three-nation proposal of the United States, Britain, and France and the Soviet amendments be submitted to the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Committee for consideration at the same time.

When the meeting on the 19th voted on the three-nation proposal of the United States, Britain, and France and the Soviet amendments, representatives of the countries that make up the core of United Nations aggression voted in favor of the three-nation proposal. Forty-four votes were in favor of the three-nation proposal, and the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it. The delegations of Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina abstained, and the Burmese delegation refused to participate in the vote. Thus, a total of sixteen national delegations refused to support the three-nation proposal. This is a very significant phenomenon, which fully confirms that the United States is gradually losing its prestige.

Representatives of some small countries once again stated, when explaining their reasons for voting, that these small countries feel uneasy about the United States' arbitrary policies and believe that any proposal must be supported by all major powers to be effective. For example, even the representatives of Ecuador and Iraq, who voted in favor of the three-nation proposal, said that they did not think this proposal would have effective results, and they believed that success could only be achieved on the basis of an agreement between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The Egyptian representative explained the reason for abstaining: We do not believe in the majority easily obtained by the three-nation proposal here. This majority even refuses to discuss the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons in the proposal. Someone here said that the League of Nations in the past failed to complete the tasks it was charged with because the United States did not participate in that organization. I do not want the people of the world to have reason to say in the future that the United Nations has failed to live up to the expectations of the people because the United States participated in the work of the organization too actively. In addition, representatives from some other countries also made similar speeches.

    联大政委会结束关于美英法三国“裁军”提案的讨论
    维辛斯基再斥三国伪装裁军阴谋
    十六国代表团拒绝支持虚伪的三国提案【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会已在十二月十九日结束了自十一月十九日起就开始的，讨论美、英、法三国所提出的“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的提案和苏联代表团对这个提案所提出的修正案的工作。
    在十二月十四日的政治委员会会议上，美国代表耶塞普提出了经美、英、法三国修正后的提案。耶塞普说，三国提案的起草人已经根据苏、美、英、法四国小组委员会在几点上所达成的协议，将提案内容作了一些修改。但是，连耶塞普自己也承认，这一些修改只是消除了一些细小问题上的分歧。对于所讨论的问题的实质部分的根本分歧还是没有解决。耶塞普并在十五日会议上表示，美、英、法三国这个提案必须作为原子能与常规军备委员会的工作的基础。
    在十四日以后的连日会议中，许多国家代表发言反对三国提案。波兰代表说：三国的修正提案具有以前提案的所有主要缺点，因此不能把这个提案作为原子能与常规军备委员会的工作方针。三国修正提案没有谈到禁止原子武器的事，也没有谈到五大国应在一年内裁减军备和武装部队三分之一。波兰代表说：叙利亚代表说，必须继续努力，以求就正在讨论的问题达成协议。这不仅是叙利亚代表的意见，许多其他国家的代表团也有同样的意见。因此，美国不应该事先强使原子能与常规军备委员会接受它的计划。美国代表企图硬要这个委员会接受三国提案作为工作的基础，就意味着放弃使四国获得协议的努力。波兰代表团认为：只有通过苏联的修正案，才能为这个委员会将来的工作创造健全和具体的基础。波兰代表建议把三国提案和苏联修正案都提交原子能与常规军备委员会去审查。
    白俄罗斯、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克代表也在会上发言揭露三国提案的本质，并热烈拥护苏联的修正案。
    埃及代表说：三国提案忽略了禁止原子武器的问题，而这是最重要的问题。自以为在原子军备方面占优势的国家当然想保持原子武器，把它作为对其他国家施行压力的工具，因而就反对禁止原子武器。埃及代表指出禁止原子武器问题必须毫不延迟地加以解决。他建议大会把无条件禁止原子武器及其他大规模破坏的武器作为它的主要任务，并责成大会法律委员会在本届大会期间拟定禁止原子武器的协定草案。
    巴基斯坦代表说：原子能与常规军备委员会首先必须不是根据单方面的要求和愿望通过决议，它的活动才可能成功。只有在四大国都可以接受的基础上获得的那种协议才是有效的。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十八日在会上作了长篇发言，他有力地证明三国修正提案也和以前的提案一样，企图以汇集军备和武装部队的情报的建议，来代替裁减军备和禁止原子武器。他指出目前的三国提案不能满足渴望和平的人民的希望，因此决不宜于作为原子能与常规军备委员会根据有关各方都能接受的原则拟订建议的基础。维辛斯基说：苏联代表团支持埃及代表的建议，即联合国大会应该无条件地禁止使用原子武器及其他一切大规模杀人的武器；苏联代表团也支持波兰代表的建议，即把美、英、法三国提案和苏联的修正案同时提交原子能与常规军备委员会考虑。
    在十九日会议就美、英、法三国提案和苏联修正案进行表决时，组成联合国侵略核心的各国代表投票通过了三国提案。赞成三国提案的有四十四票，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等五国代表团投票反对，叙利亚、阿富汗、也门、埃及、印度、印尼、伊朗、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯和阿根廷等十国代表团弃权，缅甸代表团拒绝参加投票。这样就共有十六个国家的代表团拒绝支持三国提案。这是很有意义的现象，完全证实了美国正在逐渐丧失威信。
    某些小国代表在说明投票理由时再一次表明，这些小国对美国专横政策感到不安，它们认为任何建议必须获得全体大国的支持才能有效。例如，甚至投票赞成三国提案的厄瓜多尔代表和伊拉克代表也说，他们不以为这个提案会有有效的结果，他们认为只有在苏美英法四国取得协议的基础上才能成功。埃及代表解释弃权的原因时说：我们并不相信三国提案在这里轻易取得的多数。这个多数甚至拒绝在提案中谈到禁止使用原子武器这一点，有人在这里说，过去的国际联盟所以没有能够完成它所负的任务，是因为美国没有参加那个组织。我不希望世界人民今后有理由说联合国之所以不负人民的期望，是因为美国太积极地参加了这个组织的工作。此外还有一些其他国家的代表也作了类似的发言。
