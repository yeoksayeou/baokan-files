Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant
Leading Cadres Neglect Asset Inventory, Large Quantities of Off-the-Books Materials are Backlogged and Wasted

Due to the administrative leading cadres' lack of attention to asset inventory work, a large quantity of off-the-books materials in Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant have been backlogged and wasted. According to the working group dispatched to the steel plant by the Southwest Materials Administration, if the steel plant were to further inventory, it could clear out at least around 10,000 tons of off-the-books materials, such as machinery and steel materials.

The steel plant inventoried its warehouses last year and its assets in July this year, but neither time were the masses of workers well-mobilized for a thorough investigation. From July to mid-September this year, the entire plant only cleared out over 2,000 tons of off-the-books materials. When the Southwest Materials Administration dispatched a working group to the steel plant in August to assist with the inventory work, the plant's administrative leading cadres even used "delaying production" as an excuse to postpone the inventory work. As a result, many off-the-books materials were still discarded in open-air yards, without being cleared and effectively used. Some were urgently needed equipment, but because they were not recorded in the books in the past, the management personnel went outside to buy them, wasting a lot of the state's circulating funds. Now, the administrative leaders of the steel plant have realized the seriousness of this problem and are mobilizing workers to continue to inventory off-the-books materials.

### 重庆一零一钢铁厂  领导干部不重视清理资产大批账外物资被积压浪费

    重庆一零一钢铁厂
    领导干部不重视清理资产大批账外物资被积压浪费
    由于行政领导干部不重视清理资产工作，重庆一零一钢铁厂大批账外物资被积压和浪费。据西南物资管理局派到钢铁厂的工作组估计，钢铁厂如果进一步清理，至少还可以清出机械、钢铁材料等一万吨左右的账外物资。
    钢铁厂去年曾清理仓库，今年七月曾清理资产，但都没有很好发动职工群众彻底清查。从今年七月份到九月中旬，全厂只清理出账外物资二千多吨。当八月份西南物资管理局派工作组到钢铁厂协助清理工作时，厂的行政领导干部还以“耽误生产”为藉口，拖延清理工作。结果许多账外物资仍被弃掷在露天场中，没有加以清理和有效使用。有些是很需用的器材，因过去没有上账，管理人员却向外面去买，浪费了国家很多的流动资金。现在钢铁厂的行政领导人员已认识到这一问题的严重性，正发动工人继续清理账外物资。　（据新华社消息）
