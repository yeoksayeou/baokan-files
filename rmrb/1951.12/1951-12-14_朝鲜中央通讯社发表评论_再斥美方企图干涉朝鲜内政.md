    Korean Central News Agency Publishes Commentary
    Again Reprimanding the U.S. for Attempting to Interfere in Korean Internal Affairs
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 13th] The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 12th, denouncing the U.S. for continuing to delay the Korean armistice negotiations. The commentary stated: Fifteen days have passed since the armistice negotiations entered the discussion of the third agenda item. Due to the U.S.'s policy of delaying negotiations and its ambition to invade Korea, no agreement has yet been reached on the third agenda item. The commentary pointed out: The principled proposals put forward by our side are the most reasonable solutions for the satisfactory conclusion of the third agenda item. However, the U.S. stubbornly rejects our fair and reasonable proposals and insists on unreasonable proposals that are unacceptable to our side.
    The commentary asked: What reason does the U.S. have to oppose our side building airports in the rear while demanding to strengthen their own military power and arbitrarily conduct aerial reconnaissance in northern Korea? Anyone with a basic understanding of international law will know that the U.S.'s intention is to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. The commentary concluded: The people of Korea and China have made sincere efforts to strive for peace. If the U.S. aggressors regard our sincerity as a sign of weakness and insist on carrying out a war of aggression; then the people of Korea and China will use the power of great unity to give the enemy even heavier blows.

    再斥美方企图干涉朝鲜内政
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜中央通讯社在十二日发表评论，斥责美方继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判。评论说：自停战谈判进入第三项议程的讨论以来，十五天已经过去了。由于美方拖延谈判的政策以及它的侵略朝鲜的野心，第三项议程至今仍未达成协议。评论指出：我方提出的原则建议，是使第三项议程圆满达成协议的最合理的方案。但是，美方却顽固地拒绝了我方这种公平合理的建议，坚持为我方所不能接受的无理提案。
    评论问道：美方有什么理由一方面反对我方在后方建筑机场，一方面却要求增强他们自己的军事力量，并任意在朝鲜北部进行空中侦察呢？凡是有国际法起码常识的人都会知道，美方的企图就是干涉他国内政。评论最后说：朝中两国人民为了争取和平，已经尽了真挚的努力。如果美国侵略者竟把我们这种诚意看成软弱的表现，坚持进行侵略战争；那么，朝中两国人民就要以伟大团结的力量给敌人以更沉重的打击。
