Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The Central People's Government Ministry of Trade has decided that in 1952, national state-owned trading enterprises will increase production and practice economy for the state by 11 trillion yuan. Among these efforts, accelerating capital turnover will save the state 8 trillion yuan in capital, and reducing commodity circulation costs will increase state revenue by 3 trillion yuan. Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade, announced the above decision at a mobilization meeting for increasing production and practicing economy held on November 26th for all staff of the Ministry's directly affiliated organs.

The Central People's Government Ministry of Trade and the general corporations of various state-owned specialized trading companies directly under the Ministry, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, have held various meetings to convey and discuss the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. On November 12th, the Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy of the organs directly under the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade was established, and on November 26th, a mobilization meeting for increasing production and practicing economy was held for all staff. At the meeting, Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade, pointed out in his report that the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade and the general corporations of various state-owned specialized trading companies are the leading institutions of state-owned trading enterprises and should play an exemplary role in this movement.

Yao Yilin, representing the Ministry's Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, pointed out to all staff present that in order to guarantee the completion of the task of increasing production and practicing economy by 11 trillion yuan next year, the staff of the organs directly under the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade must: 1. Greatly improve work efficiency, strengthen the planning and accuracy of work, give full play to all potential forces, and change the phenomena of overlapping institutions, procrastination, bureaucratic correspondence, uneven distribution of workload, and disconnection between some work departments. 2. Resolutely oppose extravagance and waste, economize on regular and business expenses, change the phenomena of waste in capital construction, equipment, automobile use, and other aspects; resolutely oppose various corrupt and degenerate behaviors, and mobilize all staff to fight against corrupt and degenerate elements. 3. Streamline institutions on the basis of improving work efficiency and opposing corruption and waste. In 1952, 15 to 20 percent of the existing personnel of the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade and its directly affiliated organs will be transferred to form work teams to help carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy in grassroots units of state-owned trading enterprises throughout the country.

Yao Yilin said: Whether the movement to increase production and practice economy can be carried out well is the central key to whether state-owned trade departments can complete the tasks assigned by the state in 1952. Therefore, the heads of state-owned trade departments at all levels must personally lead this movement and form a committee for increasing production and practicing economy composed of representatives of the trade union, representatives of the Communist Party, representatives of various democratic parties, model workers, and representatives of technical personnel, to be responsible for promoting this movement. The movement to increase production and practice economy must resolutely rely on the masses of workers and staff, so that every worker and staff member can consciously care about and improve various tasks with the attitude of a master, making this movement a mass-based economic accounting movement and a movement to improve work efficiency. At the same time, in the movement, various work departments must strengthen connections and promote a system of contact contracts. The administrative leadership will appropriately adjust the wages of workers and staff in the movement according to the actual situation, and under the existing conditions, actively develop employee welfare undertakings to reduce the special difficulties of staff. At the same time, model workers and those who actively provide rationalization proposals that are adopted and implemented and have achieved results will be promptly rewarded in the movement.

    中央人民政府贸易部决定明年增产节约十一万亿元
   【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府贸易部已决定全国国营贸易企业一九五二年为国家增产节约十一万亿元，其中在加速资金周转方面，要为国家节省资金八万亿元，在减低商品流转费用方面，为国家增加收入三万亿元。中央人民政府贸易部副部长姚依林十一月二十六日在该部直属机关全体职工增产节约动员大会上宣布了上述决定。
    中央人民政府贸易部和该部直属各国营专业贸易公司总公司，为响应毛主席增产节约的号召，曾召开了各种会议，传达和讨论了人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的决议，在十一月十二日成立了中央人民政府贸易部直属机关增产节约委员会，并在十一月二十六日召开了全体职工增产节约动员大会。在大会上，中央人民政府贸易部姚依林副部长在报告中指出中央人民政府贸易部和各国营专业贸易公司总公司是国营贸易企业的领导机构，要在这个运动中起模范作用。
    姚依林代表该部增产节约委员会向到会全体工作人员指出，为了保证完成明年增产节约十一万亿元的任务，中央人民政府贸易部直属机关的工作人员必须做到：一、大大提高工作效率，加强工作的计划性和准确性，发挥一切潜在力量，改变机构重叠、工作拖拉、公文旅行、人员闲忙不均和有些工作部门之间的工作上脱节的现象。二、坚决反对铺张浪费，节约经常费和业务费开支，改变在基本建设上、器具设备上、汽车使用上和其他各方面的浪费现象；坚决反对各种贪污蜕化行为，发动全体职工和贪污蜕化分子作斗争。三、在提高工作效率和反对贪污浪费的基础上精简机构。要在一九五二年抽调中央人民政府贸易部和直属机关现有人员的百分之十五到百分之二十组成工作团，到全国各地国营贸易企业基层单位帮助开展增产节约运动。
    姚依林说：增产节约运动能否做好，是国营贸易部门一九五二年能否完成国家给予的任务的中心关键。因此，各级国营贸易部门的首长必须亲自领导这个运动，并组成由工会代表、共产党代表、各民主党派代表、工作模范和技术人员代表参加的增产节约委员会，负责推动这一运动。开展增产节约运动必须坚决依靠职工群众，使每一职工都能自觉地以主人翁的态度来关心和改进各种工作，使这一运动成为群众性的经济核算运动和提高工作效率运动。同时，在运动中各工作部门之间必须加强联系，推行联系合同制度。行政领导方面在运动中将根据实际情况，适当调整职工工资，并在现有条件下，积极举办职工福利事业，减少工作人员的特殊困难。同时，在运动中对模范工作者和对积极提供合理化建议被采纳实施并有成效者都要及时予以奖励。
