    Hui People's Propagandist, Mu Sha
     Da Wudai
    Mu Sha is a Hui people's propagandist from the seven mosques (Qingzhensi) and thirteen neighborhoods (Hui people's residential streets) of Xi'an City. The Hui and Han people living in the neighborhoods all love and respect him. Whenever they encounter something they don't understand, they go to ask Mu Sha, who always patiently and kindly answers them.
    Mu Sha conducts propaganda work to the masses at any time and any place. Reading groups, teahouses, and cigarette stalls are all his propaganda venues. Even when he visits someone's home, he takes the opportunity to propagate to the masses. During the signature campaign to support the Five Great Powers' conclusion of a peace pact, he hung a signature book on his "Hu La Tang" (a kind of food) carrying pole, and at any time conducted propaganda to buyers, inviting them to sign the signature book.
    Mu Sha's propaganda methods are diverse. In addition to oral propaganda, he also uses reading the newspaper and clapperdash to conduct propaganda to the masses. Every day he carefully reads the important news in the newspaper, reads it thoroughly, and first recites it to his mother, wife, and the people living in the same courtyard, and then takes turns going to the reading group to recite it. Later, he felt that merely reciting the newspaper and talking about the newspaper was not enough to achieve a great propaganda effect, so he began to learn clapperdash. He memorized some of the clapperdash published in the newspaper. After memorizing a lot, he learned to compose it himself. In this way, it was easier to combine with the situation at that time and in that place to compose clapperdash, expand the propaganda influence, and was very popular among the masses.
    Mu Sha is also good at using examples of the masses' personal experiences to educate the masses. When Xi'an City was clearing up counter-revolutionary backlog cases, some backward people who had some connection with counter-revolutionary elements secretly said: "The Hui people under heaven are one family, we can't 'harm' them." Mu Sha, on the one hand, united with activists to conduct persuasion and education at any time to these ideologically confused people; on the other hand, he conducted research with the responsible comrades of the Hui People's Cultural Center to collect materials about the crimes of counter-revolutionaries and told the masses. At a mass meeting, he said to everyone: "The Hui people under heaven are one family, but the counter-revolutionaries among the Hui people are not one family with us." He used the bandit Ma Bufang and the bandit Ma Hongkui as comparisons, and cited examples of counter-revolutionary elements Wu Bin and Jia Zhongyi carrying out counter-revolutionary activities and undermining the unity of the Hui people to conduct propaganda to everyone. In this way, the masses distinguished the line between the enemy and ourselves, unanimously demanded that the two criminals Wu and Jia be sentenced to death, and on the spot, reported another group of lurking counter-revolutionary elements.
    Among the Hui people, there was an old man named Mai Lao'er, who was about fifty years old and had a relatively stubborn mind. He asked Mu Sha: "Mu Sha, you always say that we've turned over, but I haven't seen you turn over. Are you still selling Hu La Tang all day long?" Mu Sha cited concrete examples such as the local Hui people participating in the people's regime and the Hui children having the opportunity to go to school to answer this question. Mai Lao'er's thinking was straightened out, and he even asked to work with Mu Sha. In this way, Mu Sha expanded the propaganda team in his work.

    回民宣传员穆沙
     达悟呆
    穆沙是西安市七寺（清真寺）十三坊（回民聚居的街巷）的回民宣传员。坊上住的回、汉人民，都爱戴他、尊敬他。他们遇着有不明白的事，就跑去问穆沙，他总是耐心地和蔼地给人家回答。
    穆沙是随时随地向群众进行宣传工作的。读报组、茶馆、纸烟摊等处，都是他的宣传场所。他就是到谁家去作客，也利用机会向群众宣传。在拥护五大国缔结和平公约签名运动中，他在自己的“胡拉汤”（一种食品）担子上挂上一本签名册，随时向买主进行宣传，邀请他们在签名册上签名。
    穆沙的宣传方式是多种多样的，除了口头宣传外，还用读报和快板向群众进行宣传。他每天细心阅读报纸上的重要消息，读熟了，先念给母亲、媳妇和同院住的人听，然后再轮流到读报组去念。后来，他感到光是念报、讲报，宣传的效果还不够大，便开始学习快板。他把报上登的一些快板背得烂熟。背的多了，自己便学着编。这样，就更容易结合当时当地的情况编出快板，扩大了宣传影响，很受群众欢迎。
    穆沙还善于运用群众亲身经历的事例来教育群众。西安市在清理反革命积案时，某些与反革命分子有点关系的落后的人们背地里说：“天下回民是一家，咱不能‘害’人家。”穆沙一方面团结积极分子向这些思想糊涂的人随时进行说服教育；一方面和回民文化馆的负责同志进行研究，搜集有关反革命罪行的材料，告诉群众。在一次群众大会上，他向大家说：“天下回民是一家，但是回民里面的反革命跟咱可不是一家。”他拿马匪步芳、马匪鸿逵做比方，并引证反革命分子乌斌和贾忠义进行反革命活动和破坏回民内部团结的实例，向大家进行宣传。这样，群众才分清了敌我界线，一致要求把乌、贾二犯判处死刑，并当场检举了另外一批潜伏的反革命分子。
    回民中有个买老二，是个五十来岁的老汉，思想比较固执。他问穆沙：“穆沙，你总说翻身咧，我怎没见你翻身，你还是整天卖胡拉汤？”穆沙就举出当地回民参加人民政权、回民娃娃都有了上学机会等具体事例，回答了这个问题。买老二的思想搞通了，而且还要求和穆沙一块搞工作。就是这样，穆沙在工作中扩大了宣传队伍。
