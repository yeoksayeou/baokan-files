　　Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Internal contradictions within the North Atlantic aggression bloc are increasingly intensified. The US plan to force Western European countries to organize a "European Army" suffered another serious setback at the so-called "European Consultative Assembly" held in Strasbourg, France from November 26th to December 11th, and at the meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the West German puppet state on December 11th in the same place to negotiate the "European Army" issue.
    The issue of organizing a "European Army" directly commanded by Eisenhower is the central issue in the US's current war preparation policy in Europe. Therefore, although this issue failed at the Rome Conference, the US still emphasized in the final communique of the Rome Conference that the meeting to negotiate the "European Army" issue should "end its activities as soon as possible so as to submit a clear report to the Council for consideration at the next meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council (scheduled to be held in Lisbon on February 2nd next year)." The day after the Rome Conference ended, according to a dispatch from Rome by the Associated Press, the US "will use all its diplomatic power to promote the plan to establish a forty-three division European Army. A senior official who attended the Rome Conference said: The United States is eager to formulate a treaty explaining the precise plan for the establishment of this international army before the opening of the Lisbon Conference."
    Precisely because of this, the US has put in great effort in this Strasbourg conference, attempting to force Western European countries at these two conferences to agree to surrender their respective sovereignty and establish a "supranational" political institution to govern the "European Army," and to establish a common budget system to raise funds for the "European Army." Before the so-called "European Consultative Assembly" opened on November 26th, fourteen US congressmen specifically went to Strasbourg to hold five days of so-called "informal talks" with congressmen from Western European countries participating in the "Consultative Assembly." According to the US Information Agency, they roughly rebuked Western European countries for not being resolute and ruthless enough in exploiting the people to complete war plans. For example, "US Congressman Keating said: 'Americans fully understand' the shortcomings of European countries, such as failures in taxation." At the same time, they also carried out shameless threats against Western European countries. They publicly issued a statement after the talks, stating that "European countries must expect the amount of US aid to be proportional to the degree of European unification achieved." However, despite the great pressure used by the US congressmen, even the *New York Times* had to admit afterwards that this pressure "did not solve any problems related to European unification." The US attempt completely failed at the two Strasbourg conferences.
    First of all, at the "European Consultative Assembly," British Home Secretary Ede on November 28th reiterated Britain's position of not participating in the "European Army" and opposing the establishment of a "European Federation." This was a heavy blow to the "European Army" plan. The French representative Reynaud, who enthusiastically advocated the "European Army," angrily stated at the time that Britain's attitude "will inevitably cause the European Army plan to collapse." Because, according to the American magazine *Time*, published on December 3rd, if "Britain is unwilling to form an alliance with continental countries, the Scandinavian countries are unwilling to join the alliance unless Britain also does so, and the remaining countries are unwilling to form an alliance themselves because Britain and the Scandinavian countries do not participate." Sure enough, in subsequent meetings, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg expressed their unwillingness to hand over their sovereignty to the "supranational" institution governing the "European Army." According to the United Press, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg insisted that "each of the six countries" organizing the "European Army" "should have a veto power in the European Army." The Belgian representative also opposed the establishment of a supreme institution governing the "European Army," advocating that countries continue to "retain control over their own troops." Thus, the meeting completely fell into irresolvable confusion and disagreement. The Belgian representative Spaak, who had served as chairman of the "Consultative Assembly" since its establishment in 1949, angrily resigned at the last meeting on December 11th. He warned that "the European unification movement is dying." "Our cause has reached the end of the road," "we have almost given up all opportunities to build a unified Europe."
    As for the meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and West Germany, the failure of the US plan was equally obvious. Schuman himself admitted at a press conference held after the meeting that "the issues of the political institutions controlling the European Army and the common budget for maintaining this army" remained "unresolved." The meeting therefore had to temporarily shelve the issues and decided to reconvene in Paris on December 27th to discuss them.
    The situation at the two Strasbourg conferences fully reflects that no matter how consistent the North Atlantic war bloc is in its despicable cause of opposing the Soviet Union and the people, there are insurmountable and increasingly large contradictions within it. Smith, one of the US congressmen who went to Strasbourg, said disappointedly: "I originally went to Strasbourg to hear how European unification was achieved, but the result was just hearing that this matter was impossible." Shackford, the European news editor of the US United Press, also pessimistically commented on the future of the European Army on December 10th: "The United States hopes that European countries will forget their national self-esteem, give up their national sovereignty, and live together without barriers like the forty-eight states of the United States. But those realists who have been paying attention to and studying Europe for decades, even those who advocate the European Federation or alliance the most, are worried that the day to realize this plan is still very far away."

　　北大西洋侵略集团内部矛盾愈来愈大
    美国逼迫西欧各国组织“欧洲军”的计划
    在斯特拉斯堡两个会议上又遭严重挫折
    【新华社二十日讯】自从北大西洋集团西欧各国在罗马会议上拒绝了美国要求它们从速组织所谓“欧洲军”的计划以后，美国坚持“欧洲军”应该迅速成立的企图，接着又在十一月二十六日至十二月十一日在法国斯特拉斯堡举行的所谓“欧洲咨询议会”上以及十二月十一日在同一个地方举行的法、意、荷、比，卢五国与西德傀儡国家外交部长谈判“欧洲军”问题的会议上，继续遭到了严重的挫折。
    组织一支由艾森豪威尔直接统帅的“欧洲军”的问题，乃是美国目前在欧洲所推行的备战政策中的中心问题。因此，虽然这个问题已经在罗马会议上流产，但是，美国仍然在罗马会议的结束公报中强调表示要谈判“欧洲军”问题的会议，“尽快结束其活动，以便在（定于明年二月二日在里斯本举行的）北大西洋公约理事会下次会议上提出明确的报告供理事会考虑”。在罗马会议结束的次日，据美联社从罗马发出的电讯透露，美国就“以其全部外交力量来推进建立四十三师欧洲军的计划。曾出席罗马会议的某高级官员说：美国亟欲在里斯本会议开幕以前制成一项说明建立这种国际军队的精确计划的条约。”
    正因为如此，美国对这次的斯特拉斯堡会议曾用过极大的功夫，企图逼迫西欧各国在这两个会议上同意交出各自的主权而建立一个管辖“欧洲军”的“超国家”政治机构，并且建立为“欧洲军”筹措经费的共同预算制度。当所谓“欧洲咨询议会”在十一月二十六日开幕以前，就有十四名美国议员特地到斯特拉斯堡去，和参加“咨询议会”的西欧各国议员进行了五天的所谓“非正式会谈”。据美国新闻处透露：他们曾粗暴地斥责西欧各国在榨取人民以完成战争计划方面不够坚决，不够狠毒。例如，“美国众议员基廷就说：‘美国人充分了解到’欧洲各国的缺点，譬如在税收方面的失败就是一例。”同时，他们也对西欧各国进行了无耻的威胁。他们在会谈结束后公然发表了一个声明，要“欧洲各国必须按照实现欧洲统一的程度来期待美援的数量”。但是，尽管美国议员们使用了这样大的压力，甚至《纽约时报》在事后仍不得不承认，这种压力“并没有能解决有关欧洲统一的任何问题”。美国的企图在斯特拉斯堡的两个会议上完全落了空。
    首先，在“欧洲咨询议会”上，英国内政大臣费夫于十一月二十八日重申英国不参加“欧洲军”和反对建立“欧洲联邦”的立场。这是对“欧洲军”计划一个沉重的打击。热心为“欧洲军”鼓吹的法国代表雷诺当时即悻然发言，认为英国这种态度“势必使欧洲军计划垮台”。因为，据十二月三日出版的美国《时代》杂志说：如果“英国不愿同大陆国家结成联盟，斯堪的纳维亚国家就不愿参加联盟，除非英国也这样做，而其余各国因为没有英国和斯堪的纳维亚国家参加，它们自己也就不肯结成联盟了。”果然，在以后的会议上，比利时、荷兰、卢森堡三国就表示不愿把主权交给统辖“欧洲军”的“超国家机构”。据合众社说，荷、比、卢三国坚持组织“欧洲军”的“六国中的每一国应在欧洲军中保有否决权”，比利时代表并且反对成立统辖“欧洲军”的最高机构，主张各国继续“保有对自己军队的控制权”。这样，会议就完全陷入了无法解决的混乱和分歧。一九四九年“咨询议会”成立以来就担任主席的比利时代表斯巴克在十二月十一日最后一次会议上，愤而提出辞职。他并警告说，“欧洲统一运动正在死亡。”“我们的事业已经到了穷途末路，”“我们几乎放弃了所有建立统一的欧洲的机会。”
    至于在法、意、荷、比、卢、西德的外交部长会议上，美国计划之落空也表现得同样明显。舒曼自己在会后举行的记者招待会上就承认，“关于控制欧洲军的政治机构以及维持这个军队的共同预算的问题”，仍然“没有解决”。会议因此不得不把问题暂时搁置，并决定十二月二十七日在巴黎重新开会讨论。
    斯特拉斯堡两个会议的情况充分反映了：不论北大西洋战争集团在反苏反人民的卑劣事业上目标如何一致，但是它们内部却存在着无法克服的，而且是愈来愈大的矛盾。到斯特拉斯堡去的美国议员之一施密斯就失望地说：“我原来是要到斯特拉斯堡去听一听欧洲的统一如何达成的，但是，结果却只是听到说此事如何无法办到。”美国合众社欧洲新闻总编辑沙克福在十二月十日评论欧洲军的前途时也悲观地说：“美国希望欧洲各国忘掉它们的民族自尊，放弃它们的国家主权，象美国的四十八州一样没有隔阂地生活在一起。但是那些好几十年来注意和研究欧洲的现实主义者，甚至那些主张欧洲联邦或联盟最力的人，也担心要实现这种计划的日子还很遥远。”
