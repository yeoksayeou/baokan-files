　　[New China News Agency, Prague, 9th dispatch from TASS]: The Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Klement Gottwald, delivered a report at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on the 6th. He said: "Three months ago, on September 6, 1951, the plenary session of our Party's Central Committee, in addition to studying other issues, also studied the issue of Rudolf Slánský. As a result of this study, Slánský was removed from his post as General Secretary of the Party.
　　This was because Slánský was incompetent and unfit to perform such a duty. This was because, when Slánský was performing the duties of General Secretary of the Party, more direct pawns of the Party and the Republic's domestic and foreign enemies infiltrated the various leading organs of the Party and the state. This was because, when Slánský was performing the duties of General Secretary, his erroneous policies on cadre and organizational issues and his erroneous working methods weakened the Party's combat effectiveness, undermined Party unity, and created the danger of forming a second leading center. This created objective conditions that made it easier for the direct enemies of the Party and the state to carry out sabotage and subversive activities.
　　Nevertheless, three months ago we had not obtained any evidence to suggest that Slánský himself was a direct enemy of the Party and the state. Therefore, we believed that his activities were merely many shortcomings and errors in terms of cadres, organizational issues, and working methods, albeit many serious major shortcomings and major errors, but not malicious, genuine, anti-Party, and anti-state conspiracies.
　　The Central Committee then, based on this assessment of Slánský's activities—I repeat, we did not have any basis at that time to make a different assessment—concluded that Slánský could no longer continue to serve as General Secretary of the Party, and the Central Committee removed him from his post.
　　However, at the same time, the Central Committee was neither willing nor able to definitively conclude that Slánský was already beyond redemption. The Central Committee believed that it was necessary to give him the opportunity to work in another position so that he could prove that his previous mistakes had taught him a lesson and draw conclusions from these mistakes to be applied when working in another position. This led to the second part of the Central Committee's resolution on the Slánský case, which was to transfer him to government work. This was the situation on September 6, 1951.
　　What new things have happened since then? What new materials have we obtained since then? First, we noticed that Slánský did not act in his new position as he had promised at the Central Committee's September plenary session. He worked carelessly and brought his set of completely undesirable working methods to his new place of activity. After gathering his closest cronies, he even attempted to transfer them to his newly changed agency, attempting to form some kind of separate center in the office of the Presidium of the Government without the knowledge of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers.
　　We conducted further investigations into the activities of the various exposed subversive groups and all related circumstances. During the investigation, new facts were discovered that had not been known before. These newly discovered facts exposed Slánský as a direct, active, and arguably leading participant in an anti-Party and anti-state conspiracy. The work of exposing and gradually eliminating this conspiracy began a year ago with the arrest of the traitor and spy Sling. Later, new and very important circumstances were discovered, which seemed to completely depict Slánský's true role from another perspective. This circumstance was that we obtained irrefutable evidence that the intelligence agencies of Western imperialism were preparing for Slánský to flee to the West. All of this immediately led to Slánský's removal from his position in the government and his detention.
　　Facts prove that Slánský is a class enemy, a pawn of domestic and foreign reactionaries.
　　In light of this situation, the Slánský case is currently being tried based on new materials. Everyone will understand that it is not yet possible to disclose the details of the trial. However, those Party members and Party leaders who have had deeper interactions with Slánský should be able to greatly assist in the trial. They can and should provide the Central Committee with concrete materials about Slánský's past activities.
　　It would be best for us to briefly review the current plenary session of the Central Committee from the perspective of some new facts that we did not know in September of this year. Now, the truth has come to light: the chain of betrayal has been implicated from Sling, Švermová, Clementis, and other traitors to Slánský.
　　The class nature and ultimate goal of this betrayal were discussed in detail at the Central Committee's February plenary session. At that time, we determined that the anti-Party and anti-state traitors and subversives were pawns of the class enemy, pawns of domestic and foreign reactionaries.
　　It was already proven at that time that the ultimate goal of the traitors and subversives was to restore capitalism in Czechoslovakia, to make Czechoslovakia dependent on Western imperialists, primarily American imperialists, which would result in a new Munich, and would cause us to lose national independence and state independence. This is not an unfounded assertion, because all the traitors and subversives who were exposed at that time had revealed these despicable conspiracies, and after all, because the evidence was conclusive, they themselves had confessed. The exposure of Slánský once again confirmed and demonstrated how serious a danger the Party, the state, and the people had been in.
　　At the Central Committee's February plenary session, it was emphasized that American imperialists wanted to achieve a goal in all People's Democratic countries, including Czechoslovakia, by relying on their pawns. They passed a law to allocate 100 million US dollars for organizing sabotage and subversive activities in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries, which exposed their purpose.
　　We pointed out the terrible example of Yugoslavia. Just as the evil pawns of the United States were being exposed and eliminated in countries outside Yugoslavia, the American thugs achieved their despicable goals in Yugoslavia. At that time, we said: Because the anti-Party and anti-state conspiracy has been exposed, we have dealt a heavy blow to the plans of American imperialists. Now, after we have exposed and arrested Slánský, this blow is even heavier.
　　At the Central Committee's February plenary session, we also discussed the question of why and how the bourgeoisie sends its pawns and spies into the workers' revolutionary parties, and why and how it seeks out its pawns and spies in the workers' revolutionary parties. We cited the example of "Mravoui" (during the Austro-Hungarian Empire, plainclothes police officers sent into the workers' movement were called "Mravoui"), and emphasized that, in any country, after the bourgeois regime is overthrown, the class enemy will not stop thinking of sending pawns into the victorious revolutionary party and seeking out pawns in this party, and there is no doubt that it will be increasingly strengthened. In particular, American imperialism, which is preparing for a new world war, considers seeking out pawns in the ranks of the ruling Communist Party as part of its war preparations. The example of the traitor and enemy pawn Slánský once again confirms this.
　　However, at the Central Committee's February plenary session, it was clearly and unambiguously said to everyone concerned: "No pawn or traitor has been able to gain a foothold on our territory in the past, and none will be able to in the future. These villains will eventually receive just punishment. Czechoslovakia will never be a second Yugoslavia!"
　　I believe that the example of Slánský shows that we were not just talking nonsense. And I believe that what we said in February can be said again today!
　　The exposure and arrest of Slánský was fully endorsed by the people, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy.
　　From the day the news was announced, the Central Committee received hundreds of resolutions of support from Party organizations, enterprise personnel, agencies, and rural residents from all over the Republic every day. In many cases, urban and rural residents immediately undertook various labor obligations to support these measures in response to the conspiracies of the Republic's enemies. All loyal Party members once felt with us that there must be "a toad sitting at the water source," and now they also believe with us that we have caught it.
　　The example of Slánský proves more convincingly than other events that no matter how high a person's position is, as long as he betrays and engages in treachery, the Party and its leading organs will immediately punish him.
　　Our urban and rural workers have once again seen that the Communist Party is completely trustworthy. Individuals may betray, but the Party is always consistently loyal to its goals.
　　The news of the exposure and arrest of Slánský caused panic and confusion in the enemy's camp. Our domestic traitors' foreign masters clearly understand what kind of trump card they have played. Of course, they cannot openly admit this, so they want to further confuse the public. Their mouthpieces are constantly spreading rumors, issuing provocative "news," and speculations. By the way, they are trying to make people believe that after the Slánský case, no one in Czechoslovakia is sure of their fate.
　　That's not true, gentlemen! Every honest person and honest citizen in Czechoslovakia is completely sure of their fate and their future. The people who have absolutely no confidence and must be afraid of tomorrow are your pawns, your spies. For them, the Slánský incident is a serious warning. The above is everything directly related to the Slánský case.
　　The struggle against hostile elements inside and outside the Party should be a lasting, daily task.
　　However, in addition to this, the Central Committee should draw the attention of the entire Party, all Party organizations, Party cadres, and Party members to several issues and tasks that are placed before us because of this case.
　　It would be wrong to think that the struggle against the enemy's pawns who have built nests inside and outside the Party has ended with the arrest of Slánský and the accomplices who have already been exposed. Experience tells us that the enemy will not give up the positions they have seized without a fight. Experience also tells us that the enemy stubbornly strives to regain the positions they have lost. This means that the struggle against hostile elements inside and outside the Party is not something that can be done once and for all, but a lasting, daily task.
　　However, in carrying out this daily struggle against the enemy's pawns, we should at least prevent two harmful errors and extremes. First, we should not be suspicious of everyone. Even if there is suspicion, we should remain sober, deliberate, and not be rash or hasty, and not remove the wheat and weeds indiscriminately.
　　On the other hand, when removing weeds, no matter how dense or tall they grow, we should not feel sorry or panic. We remove these things, that is, these weeds, will only be good for the wheat. The same is true for the Party. If it systematically and regularly clears out internal dissidents and hostile elements, and unhesitatingly cuts open malignant sores on its body, no matter how large they have grown, then it will become stronger.
　　Along with the regular and systematic clearing out of the enemy's pawns, we should also systematically eliminate the damage these pawns have caused to the Party and the state. We cannot deny that this damage is quite large, and all aspects of the Party and state life have been affected. I would like to directly point out some of them.
　　We know, and the enemy also knows, that the decisive factor is the revolutionary party, the Communist Party. This proposition is not only correct during the period of struggle to overthrow bourgeois rule, but also equally correct, if not more correct, during the period after the overthrow of bourgeois rule, during the period of consolidating the victory over the bourgeoisie, during the period of transforming the entire society, and during the period of building socialism.
　　Lenin and Stalin have pointed out more than once that the significance of the working class's vanguard not only does not diminish in this second stage, but increases. Therefore, it is precisely in this second stage that the class enemy has a special "interest" in our Party. From this, we can also see what special tasks the enemy has set for its pawns within the Communist Party in this regard. Naturally, these tasks are very diverse, but I think they can be expressed in a general formula: The enemy and its pawns first attempt to undermine the Party's combat effectiveness and prestige, which is a prerequisite for realizing their further despicable conspiracies.
　　For us, what methods can the enemy use to undermine the Party's combat effectiveness and prestige? The method is, first of all, to undermine the Party's ideological and political unity, to undermine its confidence in Lenin-Stalinist theory, and to undermine its loyalty to the Soviet Union and our Comrade Stalin. And it cannot be denied that all kinds of traitors and subversives, despite their different origins and despite all the minor contradictions between them, are consistent on this point. Where there are seedlings of poisonous weeds, it is the duty of the Party and every Party member to pull them up and eliminate them, and to eradicate them regularly.
　　The Party's combat effectiveness and prestige can be undermined by undermining its organizational and political unity. At the last plenary session of the Central Committee, it was mentioned that, due to the activities of Slánský and his accomplices, there was a danger of establishing a second leading center within the Party. To eliminate this danger, the first step was taken: to remove Slánský from his post as General Secretary of the Party. The second step was to remove him from his position in the government and arrest him. I believe that these measures can only consolidate the Party's organizational and political unity and make it more closely united around the Central Committee.
　　We must build the Party with democratic centralism, and resolutely oppose the divisive conspiracies of enemies inside and outside the Party.
　　The entire Party's reaction to the Slánský case is a convincing proof. The Communist Party is a monolithic whole from top to bottom and from bottom to top. This creates its combat effectiveness and prestige. Therefore, there should be no division between Party members who are engaged in Party affairs and Party members who are engaged in other aspects of social life. And especially there should be no antagonism between Party affairs organs and Party grassroots organizations and Party masses. The Bolshevik principle of Lenin-Stalinist democratic centralism is our reliable guiding light, instructing us on how to build the Party and how to establish the interrelationship between its organs and organizations at all levels. There is no doubt that, under the leadership of Slánský and his accomplices, these Bolshevik principles have been greatly undermined. Rectification work is now being carried out in this regard.
　　We have also fundamentally reorganized the personnel of the Central Committee organs, and are currently reorganizing the organs of the state and district Party committees. However, the new organization must be infused with a commensurate spirit, so that all comrades working in this regard not only understand, but also accurately implement the tasks assigned by the elected Party organs in practical action, especially so that they can pay attention to absorbing Party members from grassroots Party organizations to carry out and implement these tasks.
　　Closely related to the above issues is the issue of the political enthusiasm of our grassroots organizations (in enterprises, villages, agencies, various groups, in short, wherever our grassroots organizations are). Our comrades, especially cadres (Party affairs workers), should recognize that their grassroots organizations represent the party that governs this country in the place where it operates, and are responsible to the entire people, the government, and the nation. Therefore, any matter, no matter what matter, that concerns our people and excites our people, should be paid attention to, and should not be allowed to escape their attention. And, without a doubt, now as before, there is no question that we cannot answer the broad masses of the people, except, of course, those provocative and probing questions that the enemy's pawns sometimes raise directly and indirectly.
　　All loyal comrades of our entire Party and various grassroots organizations should understand that we do not live in an isolated world, but are surrounded by cruel, irreconcilable enemies who will stop at nothing to restore the capitalist "paradise" and the hell of the proletariat that inevitably comes with it. These people were deprived of power by our people, and to a considerable extent, they were deprived of the property they had plundered. Everyone knows that these angry bourgeois are prepared to engage in any despicable and evil deeds in order to plot against the victorious working people and put shackles on them again. These are the kind of people for whom there is nothing sacred in the world except their original power and property. They can sell the Republic, the motherland, and the people to anyone, as long as he helps them return to their old, well-paying positions. These people and their accomplices, under the command of their foreign masters, are using their various factions to try their best in our country to force the Party and the masses, the government and the residents to split apart. Opposing all these conspiracies and similar conspiracies of enemies inside and outside the Party is one of the most important tasks of grassroots organizations and every Party cadre and Party member.
　　One of the main means, if not the main means, by which class enemies undermine the Party's combat effectiveness and prestige is to sow seeds of suspicion between Party members and Party leading organs and undermine Party discipline. The enemy deeply knows that in order to exert the Communist Party's activity and combat effectiveness, the various parts of the Party must trust each other from top to bottom and from bottom to top. The enemy deeply knows that the principle of democratic centralism implemented by Lenin and Stalin in building the Communist Party guarantees this consistency. Therefore, it is not surprising that all the enemy's pawns always oppose this principle at every step. This should be a lesson and a warning to all of us, because whatever the enemy wants is not a good thing.
　　What should we do? On the one hand, the Party's leading organs should apply Lenin-Stalinist theory to our specific conditions, constantly taking into account the ultimate goal of building socialism in our country. On the other hand, when deciding on tactics, they should not only listen to the opinions of Party organizations and Party members at all levels, but also listen to the opinions of the broad masses of urban and rural people. Naturally, the Party's leading organs should adopt a critical attitude. It should be able to distinguish which views are progressive and which views are influenced by the enemy's past and present rumors and are therefore reactionary.
　　The Party's leading organs should listen to progressive views and should appropriately criticize and ban reactionary views. In short, the Party's leading organs should follow a rule when making all decisions: think twice before acting. Of course, even if the Party's leading organs act with the best of intentions and make the greatest efforts, they cannot expect their decisions to always suit the "tastes" of all Party members. At the same time, they cannot, especially now, require all Party decisions to be widely announced in advance. In many cases, this can only be exploited by our enemies. It can be seen from this that the Party's leading organs often have to take decisions that Party organizations and Party members at all levels can only know afterwards.
　　In this case, can it be said that the Party's leading organs are undermining intra-Party democracy? Absolutely not. The existence of the leading organs is to constantly lead the Party and make necessary decisions in any situation. All veteran Communist Party members who have experienced the semi-legal and illegal periods under capitalism understand all of this very well. Now, all Party organizations, Party cadres, and Party members must understand this.
　　Communists have never been blindly obedient. If a Communist Party member has a healthy class nature, if he is armed with the basic knowledge of Lenin-Stalinist theory, and has the minimum ability to apply this theory to certain environments and certain conditions, and finally, if he has Party leaders in front of him who have been tempered in the struggle to overthrow bourgeois rule and win power for the working class, then he will always unswervingly adhere to and implement the resolutions of the Party's leading organs at all levels, even when these organs cannot consult with him in advance about these resolutions.
　　People's democratic countries and their governments will never allow anyone to disrupt state discipline.
　　There is another issue that is closely linked to the issue of Party discipline, which I call the issue of our comrades'—organizations, cadres, and Party members'—state discipline. People's democratic republics distribute state administrative power quite dispersedly. It gives unprecedented great power to state administrative organs in various regions, states, and districts. However, closely linked to this great power is the corresponding responsibility, from which arises the state discipline I just mentioned.
　　This also concerns our various organs—economic, trade, and financial organs, agricultural cooperatives, cultural organs, health organs, scientific organs, art departments, in short, all departments of our social life.
　　What is the problem here? The problem is that some responsible persons in our political, economic, or other organs seem to think that the laws, orders, and instructions issued by the higher authorities have nothing to do with them. It cannot be ignored that the enemy's direct pawns have been and are continuing to bring this and similar Trotskyist-anarchist tendencies into our social life. Those who are related to this situation should understand more quickly and deeply that people's democratic countries and their governments can no longer allow anyone to disrupt state discipline in our social life. In our Republic, the law must be obeyed by everyone!
　　Comrades, my words are coming to an end. In addition to other suggestions, the Presidium of the Central Committee also put forward a suggestion, hoping that the Central Committee will remove Slánský from his position in the Party and expel him from the Party because of his anti-state behavior. I think this is the wish of the entire Party. And I have no doubt that the Central Committee will pass the correct resolution. I look forward to this correct resolution, and from this platform, I issue a call to organizations at all levels, all Party cadres, and Party members:
　　Comrades! No matter how high a position or rank the traitors use as a cover, sweep them all away and strike them all down! Unite closely and consolidate around the Communist Party Central Committee of your own motherland! Unite and fight anew to complete our great construction tasks! We assure each other that despite all kinds of obstacles and the resistance of the enemy, we have the support of all good people, and we will definitely turn our Republic into a happy motherland for the working people in urban and rural areas! Under the banner of Lenin-Stalin, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, we won victory in February 1948. Under the banner of Lenin-Stalin, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, we will surely build socialism in our country and continue to thoroughly complete the February victory."
　　After Gottwald finished his speech, the participants stood up together and responded with stormy and prolonged cheers. In the hall, they shouted: "Long live Comrade Gottwald!"

　　在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会全体会议上
　　哥特瓦尔德关于斯兰斯基叛党叛国阴谋的报告
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布拉格九日电：捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德六日在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会全体会议上作了报告。他说：“三个月以前，即一九五一年九月六日，我们党的中央委员会全体会议除了研究其他问题之外，还研究了关于鲁道尔夫·斯兰斯基的问题，由于这次研究的结果，斯兰斯基被解除了党总书记的职务。
    这是因为斯兰斯基不称职，不适于履行这种职务。这是因为斯兰斯基在履行党的总书记的职务时，党和共和国内外敌人的嫡系走狗比较多地混进了党和国家的各种领导机关。这是因为在斯兰斯基履行总书记的职务时，他在干部问题和组织问题上的错误政策和他的错误的工作方法减弱了党的战斗力，破坏了党的团结，造成了形成第二个领导中央的危险，这就造成了客观条件，使党和国家的直接敌人便于进行破坏和阴谋造反的工作。
    虽然如此，三个月以前我们还没有获得任何罪证，能够说明斯兰斯基本人就是党和国家的直接敌人。所以，我们认为他的活动只是许多在干部方面、在组织问题上、在工作方法上的缺点和错误，虽然是许多严重的大缺点、大错误，但是并没有恶毒的、真正的、反党反国家的阴谋。
    中央委员会那时就根据对斯兰斯基活动的这种估计——我再说一次，我们那时还没有根据来作出另外的估计——作出了结论，认为斯兰斯基不能再继续担任党总书记了，于是中央委员会就把他撤职。
    但是，和这同时，中央委员会那时还不愿意也不可能盖棺论定地认为斯兰斯基已经是无可救药了，中央委员会认为必须使他有可能在别的岗位上工作，以便他能够证明以前的错误使他得到教训，从这些错误中得出供他在别的岗位上工作时应用的结论。这样便产生了中央委员会关于斯兰斯基案的决议的第二部分，就是调他担任政府的工作。这就是
    一九五一年九月六日时的情形。
    后来又发生了什么新的事情呢？我们后来获得了什么新的材料呢？首先是，我们注意到斯兰斯基在新的职位上并没有照他在中央委员会九月全体会议上所答应的那样作事。他工作草率，又把他那一套
    一无可取的工作方法带到了新的活动地点，他把他最亲信的党羽纠合起来以后，竟企图把他们转调到他新换的机构中去，企图背着部长会议主席，暗地里在政府主席团的办公室中组成某种单独的中央。
    我们对各个已被揭露的阴谋造反集团的活动以及一切与此有关的情况进行了进一步的调查，在调查当中，发现了新的以前不知道的事实。这些新发现的事实揭露了斯兰斯基，他原来是一个反党反国家阴谋的直接的、积极的、而且可以说是负领导责任的参加者。揭露和逐步肃清这个阴谋的工作是从一年以前逮捕叛徒、间谍斯林时开始的。后来又发现了新的、非常重要的情况，这个情况似乎是从另外
    一方面把斯兰斯基所扮演的真正角色完全描绘出来了，这个情况就是：我们获得了无可争辩的证据，说明西方帝国主义的谍报机关正在给斯兰斯基逃奔西方进行准备。所有这一切就使斯兰斯基立刻被解除了政府中的职务，而且被预押起来。
    事实证明斯兰斯基是阶级敌人，是国内外反动派的走狗
    随着这种情形，目前正在根据新的材料审讯斯兰斯基案。每一个人都将了解，现在还不可能公布审讯的详细情形。可是和斯兰斯基交往较深的那些党员和党的负责人应该能够对审讯大有帮助。他们能够而且应当进行帮助，把斯兰斯基过去活动的具体材料交给中央委员会。
    我们最好在目前的中央委员会全体会议上，从我们今年九月还不知道的一些新事实的角度来稍微回顾一下。现在，真相已经大白：叛变的锁链已经由斯林、斯威莫娃、克利门蒂斯和其他叛徒那里牵连到斯兰斯基这里来了。
    这次叛变的阶级性和最终目的在中央委员会二月全体会议上就已经详细地谈到了。那时我们确定了：反党、反国家的叛徒和阴谋造反者乃是阶级敌人的走狗，是国内外反动派的走狗。
    那时就已经证明了：叛徒和阴谋造反者的最终目的是要使资本主义在捷克斯洛伐克复辟，要使捷克斯洛伐克依赖西方帝国主义者、首先是美国帝国主义者，而结果就会造成新的慕尼黑，就会使我们丧失民族独立和国家独立。这并不是无稽的断言，因为所有那时被揭发出来的叛徒和阴谋造反者都已暴露出有这些卑鄙龌龊的阴谋，而且毕竟因为罪证确凿，他们自己也已供认不讳了。对斯兰斯基的揭发再一次证实并且表明了党、国家和人民曾经处在如何严重的危险当中。
    在中央委员会二月全体会议上曾经有人强调指出过：美帝国主义者想依靠他们的走狗，在所有的人民民主国家达到一种目的，而在捷克斯洛伐克也不例外；他们通过了一项法律，要拨款一亿美元作为在苏联和人民民主国家组织破坏和谋叛活动之用，这就把他们那种目的自行暴露出来了。
    我们曾指出南斯拉夫这个可怕的例子，正当美国的万恶走狗在南斯拉夫以外各国被揭露、被铲除的时候，美国流氓却在南斯拉夫达到了他们那卑鄙龌龊的目的。那时我们就说：因为反党、反国家的阴谋已被揭露，我们已经给了美帝国主义者的计划一个沉重的打击。现在，在我们已经揭露并逮捕了斯兰斯基以后，这个打击就更沉重了。
    在中央委员会二月全体会议上我们还讨论过这个问题：资产阶级为什么和用什么方法派遣它的走狗和间谍到工人的革命政党中来，为什么和用什么方法在工人的革命政党中物色它的走狗和间谍？我们曾举过“姆拉沃伊”的例子（奥匈帝国时代大家把派遣到工人运动中来的便衣警察叫做“姆拉沃伊”），并且强调，在无论那个国家里，在资产阶级政权被推翻以后，阶级敌人派遣走狗到已经获得胜利的革命政党里来和在这个政党中物色走狗的这种念头，是不会停止的，而且毫无疑问，还会愈益加强的。特别是准备新世界战争的美帝国主义和这件事有关，在执政的共产党队伍中物色走狗乃是它的战争准备工作的一部分。叛徒、敌人的走狗斯兰斯基的例子又一次证实了这件事。
    但是，在中央委员会的二月全体会议上已经明明白白地、毫不暧昧地向一切和这件事有关的人说过：“过去还没有而且将来也不会有任何走狗和叛徒能够在我们的国土上站稳脚根。这些恶棍终究有一天会得到公正的惩罚的。捷克斯洛伐克决不是第二个南斯拉夫！”
    我认为，斯兰斯基的例子说明，我们并没有凭空说瞎话。而且我认为，我们在二月间所说的话今天还可以再说一次！
        揭发和逮捕斯兰斯基获得人民完全赞同，沉重地打击了敌人
    揭发和逮捕斯兰斯基的消息获得了党和非党舆论的完全赞同。从这个消息公布的那天起，中央委员会每天都从共和国各地收到数百件党组织、企业人员、机关和乡村居民的表示拥护的决议。在许多场合，城乡的居民还立即承担各种劳动义务，来支持这些措施，以回答共和国敌人的阴谋。所有忠诚的党员都曾和我们一起觉到什么地方必定有“癞虾蟆在水源那里坐着”，现在他们也和我们一起认为目前我们已经把它捉住了。
    斯兰斯基的例子比其他事件更令人信服地证明了：不管一个人的职位多高，只要他一背叛，而干出出卖的勾当来，党和它的领导机构立刻就会给以惩处。
    我们的城乡劳动者又看到了：共产党是完全可以信赖的，个别的人可以叛变，可是党却是始终一贯对自己的目标忠诚到底的。
    揭露和逮捕斯兰斯基的消息，使敌人的阵营惊慌混乱起来。我们国内叛徒的外国主子们，很清楚地了解他们打出了什么样子的一张王牌。他们当然不能公开承认这一点，所以想更进一步混淆视听。他们的传声筒接连不断地制造谣言，发出挑衅性的“消息”和推测。顺便说一句，他们竭力要使人相信：似乎在斯兰斯基案以后，捷克斯洛伐克已经没有一个人对自己的命运有把握了。
    不是这样的，先生们！捷克斯洛伐克正直的人和正直的公民人人都对自己的命运，对自己的未来有完全的把握。绝对没有信心而且必定害怕明天的人，那就是你们的走狗，你们的特务。对他们来说，斯兰斯基事件真是一个严重的警告。以上说的是一切与斯兰斯基案直接有关的情形。
    和党内外敌对分子的斗争应是持久的、日常的任务
    可是，除此以外，中央委员会应当提起全党、所有党的组织、党的干部和党员注意几个因为这个案件而摆在我们面前的问题和任务。
    假如认为和已在党内外筑起了巢穴的敌人走狗进行的斗争，已因为逮捕了斯兰斯基和目前已经揭发出来的同谋犯而结束了的话，那就错了。经验告诉我们，敌人是不会不经战斗就放弃他们已经强占了的阵地的。经验还告诉我们，敌人还顽固不化地力求夺回已经丧失的阵地。这就是说，和党内外敌对分子的斗争不是什么一劳永逸的事情，而是持久的、日常的任务。
    可是，我们和敌人走狗进行这种日常的斗争，至少应该防止两种有害的错误和极端。首先，我们不应该对每个人都发生怀疑。即使发生了怀疑，也应该保持清醒，深思熟虑，不要冒昧轻率，不要把小麦和杂草莠草不分良莠一起铲除。
    另一方面，在铲除杂草莠草的时候，不管它们生得多么密，长得多么高，我们不应痛惜，不应仓皇失措。我们把这些东西，就是说把这些杂草莠草铲除，只会对小麦有好处。党也是一样。如果它有计划地、经常地清除内部的异己分子和敌对分子，在适当的时候毫不踌躇地割开不管已经在它身上长得多么大的恶性脓疮，那末它就会更加强大。
    和经常地有计划地清除敌人走狗的同时，还应该有计划地消除这些走狗使党和国家蒙受的损害。我们不能不承认这种损害是相当大的，党和国家生活的各方面都受到了这种损害。我想直接指出来一些。
    我们晓得，而且敌人也晓得：具有决定意义的因素是革命政党，即共产党。这个命题不仅在为推翻资产阶级统治而进行斗争的时期是正确的，而且在推翻了资产阶级统治以后的时期、在巩固对资产阶级胜利的时期、在改造整个社会的时期、在建设社会主义时期，如果不是更正确的话，也是同样正确的。
    列宁和斯大林曾经不止一次地指出，工人阶级先锋队的意义在这第二阶段不仅没有减小，反而增加了。因此，正是在这第二阶段，阶级敌人也就对我党发生了特别“兴趣”。由此也就可以看出敌人在这方面给他们在共产党内部的走狗提出了怎样的特别任务。自然，这些任务是十分多种多样的，不过，我认为，可以用一个总的公式把它们表现出来：敌人及其走狗首先企图破坏党的战斗力和威信，把这作为实现他们进一步的卑鄙阴谋的先决条件。
    对我们来说，敌人用什么办法才可以破坏党的战斗力和威信呢？办法就是，首先破坏党在思想上和政治上的统一，破坏它对列宁—斯大林学说的信心，破坏它对苏联和我们的斯大林同志的忠诚。而且不能不看到：各色各样的叛徒和阴谋造反者，尽管他们的由来不同，尽管他们之间存在有一切次要的矛盾，在这一点上却是一致的。那里有毒草的幼芽，就在那里把它拔起来消灭掉，经常把它连根铲除，这是党和每个党员的职责。
    破坏党的战斗力和威信，可以用破坏它在组织—政治上的统一的办法。在中央委员会上次全体会议上已经有人谈到，由于斯兰斯基及其同谋犯的活动，产生了在党内建立第二个领导中央的危险。为了消灭这种危险，已经采取了第一个步骤：撤去斯兰斯基的党总书记的职务。第二步是撤消他在政府的职务，并予以逮捕。我认为，这些措施只有巩固党在组织—政治上的统一，并使它更加紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围。
    必须以民主集中制建设党，坚决反对内外敌人的分裂阴谋
    全党对斯兰斯基案的反应便是令人信服的证明。共产党从上而下、从下而上都是固如磐石的一个整体。这就造成它的战斗力和威信。因此，以党务工作为职业的党员和在社会生活其他方面工作的党员之间也不应该有分歧。而在党务机关和党的基层组织及党员群众之间尤其不应该有对立状态。列宁—斯大林的民主集中制这一布尔什维克原则是我们可靠的指路标，指示我们如何建设党，如何确立它的机关和各级组织之间的相互关系。毫无疑问，在斯兰斯基及其同谋犯的领导下，这些布尔什维克原则已大遭破坏。现在在这方面正在进行整顿工作。
    我们也已经就中央委员会机构的人事进行了根本的改组，目前正在改组各州党委会和区党委会的机构。可是必须使新的组织贯注着相称的精神，以使在这方面工作的全体同志不仅了解，而且用实际行动准确地执行被选举出来的党机关所指定的任务，尤其是使他们能注意吸收基层党组织的党员来执行和贯彻这些任务。
    和上述种种问题有密切关系的是关于我们的基层组织（在各企业、乡村、机关、各种团体中，总之在有我们的基层组织的地方）的政治积极性的问题。我们的同志，首先是干部（党务工作者）应该认识到：他们的基层组织在它所活动的地方代表着治理这一国家的党，并对全体人民、政府和民族负责。因此，任何事务，无论什么事务，凡是关系到我们的人民和使我们的人民激动的，都应加以注意，而不应让它逃过他们的注意。而且，毫无疑问的，现在和从前一样，并没有我们不能够答复广大群众的问题，当然，敌人的走狗有时用直接和间接的形式提出的那些挑衅性和刺探性的问题除外。
    我们全党和各基层组织的全体忠实同志都应当了解，我们不是生活在孤立的世界中，而是受着残酷的不共戴天的死敌的包围，他们不惜采取一切手段来重新恢复资本主义的“天堂”以及必然与之俱来的无产者的地狱。这些人被我们人民剥夺了政权，并在相当大的程度上剥夺了他们掠夺过来的财产。大家都知道，这些暴怒的资产者准备干出任何卑鄙罪恶的勾当，以便暗算胜利了的劳动人民，再给他们套上枷锁。这些人就是这样一种人，对于他们，除了他们原先的政权以及财产以外，世界上再没有什么神圣的东西了，他们可以把共和国、祖国和人民出卖给任何一个人，只要他帮助他们重新回到他们那些收入优厚的老职位上。这些人和他们的同伙，奉他们的外国主子的命令，利用他们的各种党羽，正在我国千方百计地企图强使党和群众、政府和居民分裂开来。反对内外敌人的这一切阴谋以及类似的阴谋，就是基层组织和每一个党的干部和党员的最重要的任务之一。
    阶级敌人破坏党的战斗力和威信的主要手段之一——如果不是最主要手段的话——就是在党员和党的领导机关之间散布猜疑的种子，破坏党的纪律。敌人深深知道，为要发挥共产党的活动力和战斗力，党的各部分自上而下、自下而上必须互相信任。敌人深深知道，列宁—斯大林在建设共产党方面实行的民主集中制原则就保证这种一致性。因此，敌人的一切走狗在一切步骤上总是反对这个原则，那是不奇怪的。对我们大家来说，这应该是一个教训和警告，因为凡是敌人希望的，便不是好东西。
    我们应该怎么办呢？党的领导机关一方面应当把列宁—斯大林的学说应用在我们的具体条件上、经常考虑到在我国建设社会主义的最终目的，另一方面应该在决定策略时不仅要倾听党的各级组织和党员的意见，而且也要倾听城乡广大群众的意见。自然，党的领导机关应该采取批判的态度，它应该会分辨怎样的见解是进步的，怎样的见解是受了敌人过去和现在的谣言的影响，因而是反动的。
    党的领导机关对于进步的见解应该倾听，而对于反动的见解应当适当地予以批驳和取缔。总而言之，党的领导机关在做一切决定时都要遵守一条规则：三思而后行。当然，党的领导机关即使出于最善良的本意和作出最大的努力，也不可能期待它的决定总是适合一切党员的“脾胃”的。同时也不能，尤其在现在，要求党的一切决定都预先广泛地加以宣布。在许多场合这只能被我们的敌人利用而已。由此可见：党的领导机关往往不得不采取党的各级组织和党员只能事后知道的决定。
    在这种情况下，能说党的领导机关破坏党内民主吗？决不能这样说。领导机关的存在就是为了经常地在任何情况下领导党和作出必要的决定。凡是在资本主义下经历过半合法和非法的时期的老共产党员都十分明白这一切。现在必须让一切党组织、党的干部和党员都明白这一点。
    共产党人从来是不盲从的。如果一个共产党员具有健全的阶级本性，另外如果他是以列宁—斯大林学说的基本知识武装起来的，并且具有把这种学说运用于一定环境和一定条件的最低限度的能力，最后，如果他的面前有着在推翻资产阶级统治和为工人阶级获取政权的斗争中锻炼出来的党的领袖们，那末他就会永远毫不动摇地坚持并执行党的各级领导机关的决议，甚至在这些机关不可能事先和他商量这些决议的时候，他也是一样。
    人民民主国家和它的政府决不容许任何人破坏国家纪律
    还有一个问题是和党纪问题紧密联系着的，我把它叫做我们同志——组织、干部和党员——的国家纪律问题。人民民主共和国把国家行政权分得相当的散。它把前所未有的大权分给各地区各州各区的国家行政机构。可是，和这种大权紧密联系着的是和它相应的责任，从这里就产生了刚才我所说的国家纪律。
    这也关涉到我们的各种机关——经济、贸易和财政机关，农业合作社，文化机关，卫生机关，科学机关，艺术部门，总之，我们社会生活的一切部门。
    这里的问题在于什么呢？问题就在于：在我们的政权、经济或其他机关里，有些负责人似乎以为上级所颁布的法律、命令、指示是与他们无关的。不可以不看到，敌人的嫡系走狗已经而且还在继续把这种和类似的托洛茨基——无政府主义者的倾向带到我们的社会生活中来。和这种情形有关的人，都应该更迅速更深刻地了解，人民民主国家和它的政府不能够再让任何人在我们的社会生活中破坏国家纪律了。在我们的共和国内，法律是要一切人遵守的！
    同志们，我的话就要讲完了。中央委员会主席团除了其他建议外，还提出一项建议，希望中央委员会因为斯兰斯基的反国家的行为而解除他在党内的职务，并开除他的党籍。我想这是全党的愿望。而且我毫不怀疑，中央委员会将通过正确的决议。我期待着这个正确决议，我从这个讲台上向各级组织、党的全体干部和党员发出号召：
    同志们！不论叛徒以多高的职位、多高的等级作掩护，把他们一律清扫出去，把他们一律打倒！在自己祖国的共产党中央委员会的周围紧密巩固地团结起来！团结起来，为完成我们伟大的建设任务而作新的斗争！我们互相保证：尽管有各种阻难，尽管敌人进行抵抗，可是我们却有一切善良人们的支援，我们一定要把我们的共和国变为城乡劳动人民欢天喜地的祖国！在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会的领导下，我们曾在一九四八年二月获得了胜利。在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会的领导下，我们必将在我国建立起社会主义，继续彻底完成二月胜利。”
    哥特瓦尔德演讲完毕后，与会者一致起立，报以暴风雨般的、经久不息的欢呼声。大厅中高呼：“哥特瓦尔德同志万岁！”
