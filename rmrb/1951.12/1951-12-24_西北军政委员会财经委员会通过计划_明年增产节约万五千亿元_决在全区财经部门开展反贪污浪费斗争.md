Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 23rd: The Northwest Military and Political Committee Finance and Economics Committee held its fourth meeting from December 13th to 15th to discuss and approve the Northwest Region's governments at all levels' financial and economic departments, state-owned enterprises, and public-owned enterprises' production increase and economy practice plan for next year. This plan stipulates that the Northwest Region's governments at all levels' financial and economic departments, state-owned enterprises, and public-owned enterprises, based on the originally planned production and construction plan for next year, will further increase production and practice economy for the country by 15 trillion yuan. Among them, increasing production and practicing economy in industrial production amounts to 520 billion yuan, in transportation 210 billion yuan, in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, etc. 50 billion yuan (excluding mass production increases), in state-owned trading enterprises 420 billion yuan, in financial work 150 billion yuan (excluding tax revenue), and in the national bank 100 billion yuan. The cooperative system will increase production and practice economy by 50 billion yuan through improving business management and saving capital and commodity circulation costs.

This meeting criticized the blind complacency and麻痹ideology of economic work cadres, pointing out that some staff members in the Northwest Region's governments at all levels' financial and economic departments have serious acts of corruption and waste. Therefore, the meeting decided to launch a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the region's governments at all levels' financial and economic departments, so that economic work cadres can establish a long-term view of economy and lay an ideological foundation for carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement next year.

The meeting decided that the methods to complete next year's production increase and economy practice plan are: to fully tap the potential of enterprises, but not to allow affecting the life of machines, and oppose unprincipled overtime work; to reduce production costs, but not to allow shoddy work and materials, and not to allow reducing product quality; to accelerate capital turnover, thoroughly clear assets and verify capital; to learn advanced experience, do a good job in quota work, and implement economic accounting system. The leading aspects of the Northwest Region's governments at all levels' financial and economic departments should fully mobilize the masses to formulate production increase and economy practice plans for each factory, mine, and individual, universally formulate patriotic covenants, and carry out patriotic labor competitions. At the same time, the Northwest Region's governments at all levels' financial and economic departments must implement a top-down and mutually combined inspection system, summarize experiences in a timely manner, reward models, and criticize various bad work styles.
