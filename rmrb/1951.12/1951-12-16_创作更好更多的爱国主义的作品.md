    Create Better and More Patriotic Works
    Our literary and art workers created some works welcomed by the people of the whole country during the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. These works were full of the spirit of patriotism and truly reflected the life of our people in the war and in production and construction. These works inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, guided the people to love their lives and love their motherland, and guided the people to strive to realize their beautiful ideals. Unfortunately, there are not many of these works that are welcomed by the people of the whole country, and they cannot meet the needs of the people. Even a considerable number of literary and artistic works lack positive ideological content, make incorrect descriptions of the people's lives and struggles, and fail to play an educational role for the people.
    The main reason why many literary and artistic works are ideologically poor is that some literary and art workers have a serious tendency to detach themselves from politics and the masses. They do not regard their literary and artistic creation as a part of the great patriotic movement, and make their creative activities a tool to promote the patriotic movement to move forward. Instead, they have the motivation of "personal fame," are keen on personal expression, emphasize personal "development," only consider personal creation, regardless of national affairs, and even hold a cold attitude towards such great mass struggles as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Or they think that their life experience is almost enough, and feel that "political issues and policies will not change much," so they focus on technical learning one-sidedly. The motto of these comrades is "Don't listen to what's happening outside the window, concentrate on creation behind closed doors." As a result, they gradually leave the people, do not understand the needs of the people, and gradually lose their political sensitivity and enthusiasm.
    In this way, our literary and art workers have written some vulgar and erroneous works. When describing the working class, some authors do not try to show the working class's mastery in building the motherland, but one-sidedly describe their enjoyment of material life, and think that this is the face of the working class after liberation. When describing farmers, they do not encourage and educate farmers on how to love the motherland, but blindly praise the lifestyle of the small-scale peasant economy and spread capitalist ideas.
    In this way, some literary and artistic works distort the lives and images of the working people. They start from subjective concepts, imagine some unrealistic characters, and write some untrue stories. The result of this kind of creation that replaces life with imagination is either using preaching to replace the description of a rich life, abstracting and formalizing the vigorous advanced figures, or using their own unhealthy thoughts and feelings to express the bad works of the advanced figures among the working people.
    As everyone knows, literary and art workers are fighters on the ideological front. If a literary and art worker does not have correct thinking, noble character, and full political enthusiasm, he cannot shoulder the responsibility of educating the people. Therefore, literary and art workers should first seriously transform and continuously improve their thinking, and go deep into the fiery mass struggle to fully understand the life, thoughts, and feelings of the masses. Chairman Mao taught us: "Our literary and art workers from intellectual backgrounds, in order to make their works welcomed by the masses, must make a change and a transformation in their own thoughts and feelings."
    The people demand that our literary and art workers adopt a resolute attitude, overcome all ideological obstacles, and forge ahead bravely to create more works with patriotic ideological content for the motherland.

### 创作更好更多的爱国主义的作品

    创作更好更多的爱国主义的作品
    我们的文学艺术工作者，在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，曾创作了一些为全国人民欢迎的作品。这些作品，充满了爱国主义的精神，真实地反映了我国人民在战争中和在生产建设中的生活面貌。这些作品，鼓舞了人民群众的爱国热情，引导人民热爱自己的生活，热爱祖国，并引导人民为了实现美好的理想去奋斗。可惜，像这些为全国人民所欢迎的作品是不多的，是不能满足人民需要的。甚至有相当多的文艺作品，缺少积极的思想内容，对人民的生活和斗争作了不正确的描写，对人民群众未能起到教育的作用。
    许多文艺作品思想贫乏的主要原因，是由于某些文艺工作者存在着严重的脱离政治，脱离群众的倾向。他们不是把自己的文艺创作，看成为伟大的爱国主义运动的一部分，并使自己的创作活动，成为推动爱国主义运动更加向前发展的工具。而是怀着“个人成名”的动机，热中于个人表现，强调个人的“发展”，只考虑个人创作，不管国家大事，甚至对抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等等如此伟大的群众斗争，抱着冷淡的态度。或者是认为自己的生活体验已经差不多了，觉得“政治问题和政策，变不到那里去”，于是片面地集中搞技术学习。这些同志的格言是“两耳不闻窗外事，一心闭门搞创作”。于是，他们渐渐地离开了人民群众，不了解人民群众的需要，逐渐丧失掉政治的敏感和热情。
    这样，就使我们的文艺工作者写出了某些庸俗的内容错误的作品。有的作者在描写工人群众时，不是努力表现工人阶级在建设祖国中的主人翁姿态，而是片面地描写他们物质生活的享受，而且认为这就是解放后工人阶级的面貌。在描写农民时，不是鼓励和教育农民去如何热爱祖国，而是盲目地歌颂小农经济的生活方式，并散布资本主义思想。
    这样，就使某些文艺作品歪曲了劳动人民的生活和形象。他们从主观概念出发，设想一些不现实的人物，编写一些不真实的故事。这种以想像代替生活而进行创作的结果，就产生了或者是以说教来代替丰富的生活的描写，把朝气勃勃的先进人物抽象化、公式化，或者是以自己不健康的思想感情，去表现劳动人民中的先进人物的坏作品。
    大家知道，文艺工作者是思想战线上的战斗员。一个文艺工作者，如果自己不具有正确的思想，高尚的品质，饱满的政治热情，是不能担当起教育人民的责任的。因之，文艺工作者应首先认真改造和不断地提高自己的思想，并深入到火热的群众斗争中去，充分理解群众的生活、思想、情感。毛主席教导我们说：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。”
    人民要求我们的文艺工作者采取坚决的态度，克服一切思想障碍，奋勇前进，为祖国创造出更多的富有爱国主义思想内容的作品。
