    Communist Party Member Niu Shuxun's Extravagant and Wasteful Behavior is Egregious and Should be Investigated and Punished
    Niu Shuxun, the secretary of the Zhonggang Village branch of the Communist Party in the first district of Ba County, not only does not actively lead the masses to increase production and practice thrift, but also takes the lead in extravagance and waste. Niu Shuxun is not wealthy and often eats relief grain or borrows grain. In June of this year, Niu Shuxun's father died. He was unwilling to bury him immediately, planning to make a big show of it after the autumn harvest. He thought, "I am a cadre. If I don't make a good show of my father's death, I will 'lose face' in front of the masses." After autumn, he found two stewards to help him organize the funeral. The stewards required each household in the village to send someone to help and assigned twelve militiamen to provide "security." During the funeral procession, twelve militiamen led the coffin and fired three shots as a salute. Almost every household in the village sent gifts, ranging from three to five thousand to over ten thousand [currency unit, likely old Renminbi]. Niu Shuxun hosted over two hundred tables of banquets, made a big show of it for four days, used over four thousand jin of grain, and incurred debts of over one million [currency unit, likely old Renminbi]. The masses reflected, "Niu Shuxun's losses from this event are huge. Let's see if he'll be eating relief grain later!"
    Because Niu Shuxun did this, some people followed suit. Village cadres Cui Botao, Geng Xuechun, and others also spent a lot of money on funerals. At a time when the entire country is carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, Niu Shuxun and others are engaging in extravagance and waste. This is very wrong. They should conduct a deep self-criticism, and the local Party committee should also appropriately handle this matter. Wang Menglan

    共产党员牛树勋铺张浪费作风恶劣，应予检查处理
    中共霸县一区中岗村支部书记牛树勋，不但不积极领导群众增产节约，反而带头铺张浪费。牛树勋并不富裕，常常吃救济粮或借贷粮。今年六月，牛树勋的父亲死了，他不愿立刻埋葬，打算到秋后大闹一下。他想：“我是个干部，老人死了不好好闹一下，会在群众面前‘丢脸’。”秋后，他找了两个总管，替他筹办丧事。总管要全村每家派一个人帮忙，并派了十二个民兵作“保卫”工作。出殡时，十二个民兵领棺前行，并放了三枪当礼炮。全村几乎家家户户都送了礼，少则三千五千，多则一万多。牛树勋摆了二百多桌酒席，大闹了四天，用了四千多斤粮食，欠债一百多万元。群众反映说：“牛树勋这次闹得亏空可大啦，看他以后吃救济粮吧！”
    牛树勋这样做了，有的人就跟着学。村干部崔伯涛、耿学春等送殡也花了很多钱。正当全国开展增产节约运动的时候，牛树勋等却铺张浪费，这是很不对的。他们应该深刻地进行检讨，当地党委亦应适当处理这件事。王梦兰
