    Changing Yamen Work Style, Establishing a Democratic Work Style

    Editor: After seeing the exhibition against bureaucracy, I have a deeper understanding of the harm of bureaucracy. It not only directly violates the principle of streamlining and saving, wasting a lot of manpower and material resources, but also kills good people and gives the masses an extremely bad influence. Taking the Beijing Municipal Court system as an example, two unfortunate incidents have occurred recently, both caused by the judicial organs' excessive emphasis on official procedures. One was the Fifth District Tribunal of the People's Court, which refused to accept cases without official documents, causing citizen Zhai Zhongting to feel unable to appeal and commit suicide by poison (he was rescued). The other was the Sixteenth District (Mentougou) Tribunal, which insisted on a letter of introduction before accepting a case, resulting in Qi Guilan being murdered by her violent husband. The damage caused by these two incidents, which only emphasized official procedures and did not care about the lives of the masses, is enough to draw our attention. Such things are by no means unique to the court or to Beijing.

    In order to quickly and effectively correct this yamen work style and establish a democratic work style, I propose that, in addition to launching a thorough inspection in various departments in conjunction with today's movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we must also change the unreasonable system of not accepting the demands of the masses without official documents. The reporting desks of the government or court tribunals only have the responsibility to accept and convey all the problems of the people, and do not have the right to refuse. Responsible comrades should strengthen ideological education and leadership of the staff at the reporting desks. Because if the work style of the staff at the reporting desks is not good, it will greatly hinder the connection between the government and the people.

### 改变衙门作风，树立民主作风

    改变衙门作风，树立民主作风
    编辑同志：看了反文牍主义的展览会后，我更深刻地认识到文牍主义的危害性。它不但直接违反精简节约原则，浪费许多人力物力，而且还会害死好人，给群众以极为恶劣的影响。拿北京市法院系统来说，最近发生了两件不幸事件，都是因为司法机关过分强调公文手续所造成的。一件是人民法院第五区审判庭，拒不受理无公文的案件，致使市民翟中亭感到无处伸冤，服毒自杀（遇救）。一件是十六区（门头沟）审判庭强调没有介绍信，不受理案件，结果祁桂兰被凶夫杀害。这两件只强调公文手续，不关心群众生活的事情，造成的损害已足够引起我们的注意了，像这样的事绝不是法院一个部门或北京一个地区才有。
    为了迅速而有效地纠正这种衙门作风，树立民主作风，我提议除了结合今天反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，在各部门展开彻底检查外，同时必须改变那种没有公文就不受理群众要求的不合理制度。政府或法院审判庭的报到处，对人民的一切问题只有接受、转达的责任，没有拒受的权利。负责同志应对报到处人员加强思想教育和领导。因为报到处人员的工作作风如果不好，就会大大妨碍政府和人民群众的联系。
