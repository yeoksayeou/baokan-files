    【Our Newspaper News】 The All-China Federation of Cooperatives calls on cooperatives at all levels nationwide to universally and deeply launch a cooperative production increase and economy practice movement, striving to complete and exceed the 5 trillion yuan production increase and economy practice target for 1952. The cooperative's production increase and economy practice movement focuses on expanding trade volume, accelerating capital turnover, reducing commodity circulation costs, and improving work efficiency; and in this movement, it will overcome the unreasonable phenomena in the operation and management of the cooperative system, so that cooperatives at all levels gradually implement an economic accounting system, in order to better serve members and better cooperate with the national economic construction cause.

    In order to carry out the production increase and economy practice movement, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has made a decision, first putting forward the specific tasks of the national cooperative system for production increase and economy practice:

    1.  In terms of accelerating capital turnover: On the basis of the average capital turnover rate of cooperatives in 1951, increase by 10 to 30 percent or more. The annual turnover of rural grassroots cooperatives should reach 15.6 times; urban grassroots cooperatives should reach 21.6 times; county-level federations should reach 12 times; municipal federations should reach 12.7 times; provincial federations should reach 10.2 times; large administrative region federations should reach 7.1 times; and the national general federation should reach 6.3 times. Grassroots cooperatives nationwide should save at least 830 billion yuan, and federations at all levels above the county level should save 1.3 trillion yuan, with the entire cooperative system saving a total of 2.13 trillion yuan.

    2.  In terms of reducing commodity circulation costs: On the basis of the average level in 1951, direct costs (transportation, loading and unloading, storage, interest, etc.) should be reduced by 0.7 percent for grassroots cooperatives; 2 percent for county and municipal federations; and 0.2 percent for federations at all levels above the provincial level. Indirect costs (wages, office expenses, rent, etc.) should be reduced by 0.5 percent for grassroots cooperatives; 0.8 percent for county-level federations; 1 percent for provincial (municipal) and large administrative region federations; and 0.8 percent for the national general federation. According to the above standards, the national cooperative commodity circulation costs should save at least 2.44 trillion yuan in 1952, of which 840 billion yuan should be saved by grassroots cooperatives and 1.6 trillion yuan should be saved by federations at all levels above the county level.

    3.  In terms of improving the work of production cooperatives and affiliated processing enterprises of federations at all levels: On the basis of 1951, production costs should be reduced by 2 to 6 percent by improving labor efficiency, equipment utilization rate, and saving raw materials, and capital should be saved by 10 to 30 percent by accelerating the capital turnover rate, in order to strive to achieve a production increase and economy practice of 500 billion yuan in 1952.

    4.  In terms of increasing the workload of each cadre and expanding trade volume: The average workload of each staff member in grassroots cooperatives should be increased by 20 to 30 percent compared with 1951, and the average workload of each cadre in federations at all levels above the county level should be increased by 25 to 40 percent compared with 1951.

    The decision emphatically pointed out: Anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy are important steps for cooperatives at all levels to carry out the production increase and economy practice movement. Cooperatives at all levels should first conduct a universal and in-depth work inspection to thoroughly expose the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in various departments.

    The decision pointed out that cooperatives must pay attention to the following in the production increase and economy practice: 1. Give full play to democracy, resolutely rely on all employees, and fully mobilize the broad masses of members to carry out this movement. 2. The production increase and economy practice movement must be used as an important driving force for improving the planning of cooperatives and ensuring the completion and exceeding of the plan. In the movement, we must strengthen investigation and research work, fully grasp the needs of members, the situation of material production and sales, and the laws of commodity circulation. 3. We must thoroughly complete the asset inventory work, find out the family property, quickly handle stagnant inventory, end outstanding debts, strictly fulfill contract credit, establish various necessary management systems, and resolutely oppose the bad style of not following the system. 4. We must prevent and correct the idea and practice of treating production increase and economy practice as a temporary shock task; at the same time, we must prevent and correct the capitalist idea of not accumulating funds from improving management, but adopting capitalist management methods to obtain high profits, and reducing expenses from simply increasing the labor intensity of employees and reducing employee benefits. To this end, we must attach great importance to the ideological education and policy education of all working cadres, and constantly improve the political and ideological level of all staff.

    The decision finally pointed out: Whether the production increase and economy practice movement can be launched is not only an important key to ensuring the completion of the cooperative plan tasks for 1952, but also a central link in further getting the business operations of cooperatives at all levels on the right track. Therefore, the councils of cooperatives at all levels must concentrate their efforts to seriously lead this movement, and should actively obtain the leadership and assistance of the Party committees and governments at all levels.

    全国合作社联合总社订出计划
    明年合作社增产节约五万亿元
    号召各级合作社首先检查贪污浪费现象 【本报讯】中华全国合作社联合总社号召全国各级合作社，普遍地深入地展开合作社增产节约运动，为完成并超过一九五二年增产节约五万亿元的目标而奋斗。合作社的增产节约运动以扩大贸易额、加速资金周转、减低商品流转费和提高工作效率为中心内容；并将在这个运动中，克服合作社系统在经营管理上的不合理现象，使各级合作社逐步实行经济核算制，以便更好地为社员服务，更好地配合国家经济建设事业。
    中华全国合作社联合总社为开展增产节约运动，作出了决定，首先提出了全国合作社系统增产节约的具体任务：
    一、在加速资金周转方面：在一九五一年合作社平均资金周转率的基础上，提高百分之十到三十以上。农村基层社全年周转应达到十五点六次；城市基层社应达到二十一点六次；县级联合社应达到十二次；市联合社应达到十二点七次；省级联合社应达到十点二次；大行政区联合社应达到七点一次；全国总社应达到六点三次。全国基层社至少应节约资金八千三百亿元，县以上各级联合社节约一万三千亿元，整个合作社系统共应节约资金二万一千三百亿元。
    二、在减低商品流转费方面：在一九五一年的平均水准上，直接费用（运输、装卸、保管、利息等）基层社降低百分之零点七；县市联合社降低百分之二；省以上各级联合社降低百分之零点二。间接费用（工薪、办公费、房租等）基层社降低百分之零点五；县级联合社降低百分之零点八；省（市）及大行政区联合社降低百分之一；全国总社降低百分之零点八。依照以上标准，一九五二年全国合作社商品流转费至少应节约二万四千四百亿元，其中基层社节约八千四百亿元，县以上各级联合社节约一万六千亿元。
    三、在改进生产合作社和各级联合社附属加工企业的工作方面：要在一九五一年的基础上从提高劳动效率、设备利用率和节约原材料等方面降低生产成本百分之二到六，从加速资金周转率方面节约资金百分之十到三十，以争取在一九五二年增产节约达到五千亿元。
    四、在提高每一干部工作量和扩大贸易额方面：基层社每一工作人员平均工作量要比一九五一年提高百分之二十到三十，县以上各级联合社每一干部平均工作量要比一九五一年提高百分之二十五到四十。
    决定强调指出：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义是各级合作社开展增产节约运动的重要步骤。各级合作社应首先进行一次普遍的深入的工作检查，彻底揭发各部门中的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象。
    决定指出，合作社在增产节约中必须注意：一、充分发扬民主，坚决依靠全体职工和充分发动广大社员群众，开展这个运动。二、必须把增产节约运动作为提高合作社计划性和保证完成并超过计划的重要推动力量。在运动中必须加强调查研究工作，充分掌握社员群众需要、物资产销情况和商品流转规律。三、必须彻底完成资产清理工作，摸清家底，迅速处理呆滞存货，结束往来拖欠，严格履行合同信用，订出各种必要的经营管理制度，坚决反对不按制度办事的不良作风。四、要防止和纠正把增产节约当做临时的突击任务的想法和做法；同时防止和纠正不从改进经营管理方面去积累资金，而是采取资本主义的经营方法以获取高额利润，和从单纯加强职工劳动强度、减少职工福利等方面去减少费用的资本主义思想。为此必须十分重视对全体工作干部的思想教育和政策教育，不断地提高全体工作人员的政治、思想水平。
    决定最后指出：增产节约运动能不能展开，不仅是保证完成一九五二年合作社计划任务的重要关键，同时也是使各级合作社业务经营进一步走上正轨的中心环节。因此，各级合作社理事会必须集中力量认真地领导这个运动，并且应该主动地取得各级党委、政府的领导和协助。
