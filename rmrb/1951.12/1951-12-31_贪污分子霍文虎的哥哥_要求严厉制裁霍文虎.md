    The Brother of Embezzler Huo Wenhhu
    Demands Severe Punishment for Huo Wenhhu
    Comrade Editor: After reading the article "Youth League Member Xue Jiandong Refuses Bribery, Bravely Exposes Huo Wenhhu's Embezzlement Crimes, Saving the State from a Loss of 16.5 Billion Yuan" in the People's Daily on December 18th, I first want to express my revolutionary respect to Comrade Xue Jiandong. Scoundrels like Huo Wenhhu, in order to satisfy their selfish and despicable desires, actually steal state assets, and thus receive the deserved ending—punishment by state law. I am the brother of the scoundrel Huo Wenhhu. I have no sympathy or pity for such a brother, because he is against the people. Only by severely punishing Huo Wenhhu can I and the broad masses of the people feel at peace and happy. Under the leadership of the Party, I must work better, study more actively, and discard the remnants of landlord class consciousness in my mind more quickly. At the same time, I will persuade my mother to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and recognize the errors of the scoundrel Huo Wenhhu.

    贪污分子霍文虎的哥哥
    要求严厉制裁霍文虎
    编辑同志：我读了十二月十八日人民日报上“青年团员薛建栋拒绝受贿，勇敢揭露霍文虎贪污罪行，使国家免受一百六十五亿元的损失”一文后，首先要向薛建栋同志致革命的敬意。霍文虎之流的败类，为了满足自私的、卑鄙无耻的欲望，竟盗窃国家资财，因而得到了应有的下场——受国家法律惩办。我是败类霍文虎的哥哥。我对这样的弟弟，没有任何的同情和怜悯，因为他是和人民对立的。只有严厉制裁霍文虎，我和广大人民才能心平气和，感到愉快。在党的领导下，我要更好地工作，更积极地学习，更快地丢掉自己头脑中残存的地主阶级意识。同时，我要向母亲进行说服，使她也分清敌我，认识到败类霍文虎的错误。
