    Northeast Fifth Paper Mill Workers
    Create New National Record for Pulp Digestion Time
    To the Editor: The workers of the steaming workshop of the Northeast Fifth Paper Mill, responding to the call of Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government for increased production and conservation, have actively improved production, increasing the daily output from 4.3 vats of pulp to 6 vats of pulp. The technicians and workers of this workshop created a new national record of eight hours and twenty minutes for the total digestion time per vat on November 7th, using a method of direct and indirect steaming combined (now called rapid digestion method). In the group meeting on December 4th, they formulated a plan to shorten the total digestion time to seven hours and thirty minutes and decided to realize this plan within this year as a New Year's gift to Chairman Mao. On December 8th, based on the original rapid digestion method, they shortened the total digestion time to seven hours and thirty-five minutes, then to seven hours and twenty-five minutes on the 9th, further shortened to seven hours and eight minutes, and finally created a new record of six hours and fifty-eight minutes. Now, the productivity of the Fifth Paper Mill has increased by 144 percent compared to August this year, and the actual production has reached 120 tons, making it the pulp mill with the highest output in the country.

    东北第五造纸厂职工
    创纸浆蒸解时间的全国新纪录
    编辑同志：东北第五造纸厂制蒸车间职工，响应东北人民政府高岗主席增产节约的号召，积极改进生产，日产量已由四点三罐纸浆提高到六罐纸浆。这个车间的技术人员和工人 ，曾在十一月七日，用直接通汽和间接通汽混合并用的方法（现在他们叫做快速蒸解法），创造了每罐蒸解总时间八小时二十分的全国新纪录。在十二月四日的小组会中，他们又拟定了缩短蒸解总时间到七小时三十分的计划，并决定在今年内实现这个计划，作为献给毛主席的新年礼物。十二月八日，他们在原有快速蒸解基础上，把蒸解总时间缩短到七小时三十五分，九日更缩短到七小时二十五分，进而缩短到七小时零八分，最后创造了六小时五十八分的最高新纪录。现在，第五造纸厂的生产力比较今年八月提高了百分之一百四十四，实际生产量达到了一百二十吨，已成为全国产量最高的纸浆厂。
