    ▲ To eliminate duplication and waste in publications, the Hebei Province provincial-level organs have stopped publishing seventeen kinds of periodicals.
    In the past, there was a phenomenon of independent actions and indiscriminate publication of periodicals in Hebei Province's publications. The provincial-level organs alone published twenty-seven kinds of regular and irregular internal and external newspapers and periodicals. Some of these professional journals had poor content; individual publications even leaked state secrets due to lax editing and review systems. To change this situation, the General Office of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, the Hebei Provincial Press and Publication Office, and the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a periodical review committee to discontinue seventeen kinds of periodicals, including "Hebei Transportation," "Hebei Finance," and "Grain Industry Communications," whose content overlapped with other newspapers and periodicals and which lacked ideological and political substance. They also strengthened leadership over the ten kinds of periodicals that continued to be published, such as "Hebei Daily," "Hebei Youth," "Hebei Education," "Hebei Government Gazette," "Hebei Literature and Art," and "Hebei Agriculture and Forestry," and paid attention to improving the ideological and political content of these publications. In addition, based on work needs, the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions will prepare to run a comprehensive popular periodical aimed at workers. After this adjustment of publications by the Hebei Province provincial-level organs, not only were more than twenty editors reduced due to the cessation of seventeen kinds of periodicals, saving the state more than one billion yuan in wealth, but the guiding effectiveness of newspapers and periodicals can also be further improved.
    ▲ Shanghai workers held the first sports dance conference from the 2nd to the 3rd. Nearly 4,000 athletes from nineteen industrial trade unions, including hardware, railways, textiles, and education, participated in the conference. More than 7,000 workers participated in the dance performances at the conference. They performed collective dances such as "Increase Production and Donate," "People of the World, One Heart," "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Great Unity Dance," and "Long Live Chairman Mao."
    In the competition, the workers demonstrated excellent skills. For example, Wang Canhua of the Education Trade Union, who participated in the women's shot put competition, set a new national record with a score of 11.46 meters (the old national record was 10.97 meters).
    ▲ The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station have jointly launched a broadcast Russian conversation class from the 9th of this month, taught by Liu Yuanna and Liu Guangjie. The broadcasting time is from 9:00 to 10:00 am and 6:30 to 7:30 pm every Sunday; the broadcasting frequencies are 850 and 1080 kilocycles. The textbook used is the "Russian Conversation Reader" published by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and compiled by Liu Yuanna.

    ▲为了消除出版物的重复浪费现象，河北省省级机关已停止十七种刊物的出版。
    过去河北省的出版物中存在着各自为政、滥出刊物的现象。仅省级机关出版的定期和不定期的内外报刊就有二十七种。其中有些业务刊物，内容贫乏；个别刊物还因编审制度不严，泄露了国家的机密。为了改变这种情况，河北省人民政府办公厅、河北省新闻出版处、中共河北省委宣传部等组织了刊物审查委员会，将内容和其他报刊重复的和思想性、政治性不强的“河北交通”、“河北财政”、“粮工通讯”等十七种刊物停刊；并加强对继续出版的“河北日报”、“河北青年”、“河北教育”、“河北政报”、“河北文艺”、“河北农林”等十种刊物的领导，注意提高这些出版物的思想性和政治性。此外，根据工作需要，河北省总工会将筹办以工人为对象的综合通俗刊物。河北省省级机关出版物经过这次调整后，不但因停止十七种刊物的出版减少了二十多个编辑人员，替国家节省了十亿元以上的财富，还可以进一步提高报刊的指导效能。
    ▲上海工人在二日至三日举行第一届体育舞蹈大会。参加大会的有五金、铁路、纺织、教育共十九个产业工会的运动员近四千人。参加大会舞蹈表演的工人达七千多人。他们表演了“增产捐献”、“全世界人民心一条”、“工农兵大团结舞”、“毛主席万岁”等集体舞蹈。
    在大会比赛中，工人们表现了优秀的技术。如参加女子铅球比赛的教育工会王灿华，以十一公尺四六的成绩，创造了全国新纪录（旧的全国纪录为十公尺九七）。
    ▲北京市中苏友好协会和北京市人民广播电台合办的广播俄语讲座，从本月九日起增开广播俄语会话班，由刘媛娜、刘光杰讲授。广播时间为每星期日上午九时到十时下午六时半到七时半；广播周率为八五○和一○八○千周。教材采用中苏友好协会总会出版、刘媛娜编著的“俄语会话读本”。
