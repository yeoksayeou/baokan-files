    The Ideological Remolding Movement for Teachers Should Be Extended to the Whole Country

    Editor: Professor Hua Luogeng of Tsinghua University, in his article "We Should Only Have One Tradition—The Tradition of Serving the People," criticized the erroneous educational policies of "genius education" and "elite education" that Tsinghua University had followed in the past. I think this is correct and very necessary. This phenomenon still exists in our Northwestern Institute of Technology. After the summer vacation this year, the number of students repeating grades in our school is shockingly high, with more than 30 in the second year alone. Students who have not repeated grades are also worried about whether they will repeat grades in the future. They study desperately to be promoted. As a result, a phenomenon has formed where they only care about their professional skills and ignore politics, only focus on studying and neglect their health, causing many students to have a purely technical viewpoint. The reason for this phenomenon is that the leaders of our school have failed to grasp the correct educational policy to quickly and massively cultivate various construction talents.

    Therefore, I think that this time, teachers in higher education institutions must study hard and undergo ideological remolding so that the reform of higher education is possible. In order for teachers across the country to have the opportunity to study, I believe that the experience of the teacher study movement in Beijing and Tianjin should be rapidly promoted throughout the country.

    应该把教师思想改造运动推广到全国
    编辑同志：清华大学华罗庚教授在“我们只应当有一个传统——为人民服务的传统”一文中，对清华大学以往的“天才教育”“选民教育”的错误的教育方针，进行了批判。我觉得这是正确的，也是非常必要的。这种现象在我们西北工学院至今还存在着。今年暑期后，我校留级的同学多得惊人，仅二年级即有三十余人；没有留级的同学也在担心着今后自己是否会留级。他们为争取升级而死读书。于是形成了只管业务、不闻政治，只顾读书、不顾身体健康的现象，使不少同学存在着单纯的技术观点。造成这种现象的原因，是由于我们学校的领导者未能掌握正确的教育方针，来迅速地大量地培养各种建设人才。
    因此，我觉得这次高等学校教师必须好好学习，进行思想改造，高等学校教育的改革才有可能。为了使全国教师都能有学习机会，我认为应该把北京、天津的教师学习运动的经验迅速推广到全国各地。
