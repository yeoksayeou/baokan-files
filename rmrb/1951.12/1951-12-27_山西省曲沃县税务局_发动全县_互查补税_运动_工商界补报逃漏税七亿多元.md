    Quwo County Tax Bureau, Shanxi Province
    Launches County-Wide "Mutual Inspection and Tax Supplement" Campaign
    Industrial and Commercial Sectors Supplemented Over 700 Million Yuan in Underreported and Evaded Taxes

    Editor: In order to implement the "tax calculation according to rates" tax policy, the Quwo County Tax Bureau in Shanxi Province mobilized industrial and commercial operators throughout the county in December to launch a "mutual inspection and tax supplement" campaign. It was announced that industrial and commercial households with past tax evasion and underreporting behaviors would not be penalized if they voluntarily reported and supplemented taxes during this campaign. Those who failed to report by the deadline would not only have to pay back taxes but would also be penalized. With the assistance of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Trade Union, industrial and commercial operators established "Mutual Inspection and Tax Supplement Accounting and Invoicing Promotion Committees" based on market towns. Promotion groups were also established in various industries. Through this organization, patriotic education was conducted among industrial and commercial operators, explaining that tax evasion and underreporting were illegal acts that undermined the state's tax policy and would directly weaken national defense and economic construction. After education and enlightenment, the majority of industrial and commercial operators raised their awareness and actively supplemented taxes. For example, Duan Zimei, the head of Fuchang Company in the dried tobacco industry (and chairman of this industry), in addition to supplementing more than four million yuan in taxes, also organized three people to mobilize all dried tobacco businesses to supplement their tax reports. Cao Wending of the mill industry helped Tongyi Meat Workshop report a turnover of five million yuan and stamp duty of ten thousand yuan. Various industries in Qucun Town also discussed the role of taxation in the country. Feng Zhaoji, the manager of the "3-5 Cigarette Factory" in this town, said before the discussion, "I have consistently not evaded national taxes," but after the discussion, he supplemented more than 400,000 yuan in underreported taxes. After the discussion, Li Yuesheng Cigarette Factory voluntarily handed over its true accounting books.

    According to statistics, as of December 5th, the number of households voluntarily reporting throughout the county was approximately over 600, supplementing a total of over 756 million yuan in evaded and underreported taxes. However, during this tax supplementation campaign, there were still a small number of industrial and commercial operators who used lost or non-existent accounting books as excuses to delay reporting or underreport. I believe they should change this erroneous attitude and quickly and honestly supplement their reports.

    山西省曲沃县税务局
    发动全县“互查补税”运动
    工商界补报逃漏税七亿多元
    编辑同志：山西省曲沃县税务局为了贯彻“依率计征”的税收政策，在十二月份动员全县的工商业者，展开“互查补税”运动。并宣布：凡过去有漏税、逃税行为的工商户，在这次自报补税者，不再处罚，如过期不报，不只要补税，而且要受处罚。在工商业联合会和工会的协助下，工商业者以集镇为单位，建立了“互查补税建账建票推进委员会”，各行业并成立了推进小组；通过这一组织，向工商业者进行爱国主义教育，说明逃税、漏税是破坏国家税收政策的违法行为，并且会直接减弱国防和经济建设的力量。经过教育启发，大部分工商业者都提高了觉悟，纷纷自动补税。如旱烟业福昌公负责人段子美（是这个行业的主任委员）除补报税额四百多万元以外，并组织了三个人到旱烟业各户动员补报。磨房业曹文定帮助同义肉坊报出营业额五百万元、印花税十万元。曲村镇各行业还讨论了税收在国家中的作用。这个镇的“三五卷烟厂”经理冯照基在讨论以前还说：“我一贯不漏国税”，但在讨论后却补报了漏税四十多万元。李月盛卷烟厂在讨论以后自动交出真实的账本。
    据统计，到十二月五日为止，全县自报户数约有六百多户，补报逃漏税额共七亿五千六百多万元。但在这次补报运动中还有少数工商业者，用遗失账簿或没有账簿为藉口，拖延不报或漏多报少。我认为他们应该改变这种错误的态度，赶快老实补报。
