    The tragic failure of the Rome Conference of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Acheson, the host of this conference, admitted that at this meeting, "the Atlantic nations have not resolved the most serious difficulties they have encountered within the common defense organization (should be read as aggressive bloc)."

    The reason for the failure of the Rome Conference is, first and foremost, that the United States and its vassal states cannot escape the deep economic crisis caused by the arms race and war preparations. The United States hoped to continue to pressure its vassal states at this conference to step up the arms race and war preparations, and to quickly establish the so-called "European Army"; and it hoped that the European vassal states would be able to bear the burden of military expenditure independently, without relying on American "aid." Under the very poor economic conditions of the United States itself and its vassal states, the plan to establish a "European Army" could not but be postponed again. Moreover, the United States' rude pressure on its vassal states and its attempt to organize a supranational political organization to rule the "European Army" have also aroused dissatisfaction in these countries. Not only did Britain clearly announce that "British troops will not participate in the European Army," but even the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are hesitant to participate in the "European Army" because they are unwilling to give up their national sovereignty.

    More importantly, the increasingly strong opposition of the people of Western European countries to the U.S.'s policy of rearming West Germany and expanding the arms race and war preparations has greatly alarmed the ruling groups of these countries. The arms race and war preparations activities of the United States and other countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty completely violate the principles of the United Nations and increasingly prove that "participation in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc is incompatible with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations." Therefore, when this war conference was held in Rome, the Italian people held large-scale gatherings to express strong protests.

    The Rome Conference did not decide any important issues that the United States hoped to resolve, so the North Atlantic aggressive bloc decided to hold another meeting in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, in February next year. However, the problems postponed by the Ottawa Conference could not be resolved at the Rome Conference, and the problems postponed by the Rome Conference were even less likely to be resolved at the Lisbon Conference. Because the difficulties facing the American warmongers will only increase, not decrease.

### 罗马会议的悲惨失败

    罗马会议的悲惨失败
    北大西洋侵略集团罗马会议已经悲惨地失败了。这个会议的主持人艾奇逊承认，在这次会议里，“大西洋国家尚未解决他们在共同防御组织（应读作侵略集团）内遭遇的最严重的困难”。
    罗马会议所以失败，首先是因为美国和它的附庸国家，无法摆脱由于扩军备战而造成的深刻的经济危机。美国希望在这次会议上，继续压迫各附庸国家加紧扩军备战，迅速地把所谓“欧洲军”建立起来；并且希望欧洲各附庸国家能够单独承担军费的负担，而不依赖美国的“援助”。在美国本身和它的各附庸国家十分恶劣的经济情况下，就不能不使建立“欧洲军”的计划再度延搁下去。而且，美国蛮横地对各附庸国家施以压力，又企图组织统治“欧洲军”的超国家的政治机构，也引起这些国家的不满。不仅英国明白宣布“英国军队不参加欧洲军”，甚至连荷兰、比利时和卢森堡三国，也因为不愿意放弃自己国家的主权，而对参加“欧洲军”表示踟蹰不前。
    更重要的是西欧各国人民愈来愈强烈地反对美国的重新武装西德和扩军备战的政策，而使这些国家的统治集团十分惊恐。美国和参加北大西洋公约的其他国家的扩军备战行动，完全违背了联合国的原则，日益证明“参加侵略性的北大西洋集团是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的”。因此，当这个战争会议在罗马举行的时候，意大利人民曾举行了大规模的集会，表示强烈的抗议。
    罗马会议没有决定美国希望解决的任何重要问题，因此北大西洋侵略集团决定明年二月再在葡萄牙首都里斯本召开会议。然而渥太华会议延搁下来的问题既不能在罗马会议上解决，而罗马会议延搁下来的问题就更无希望在里斯本会议上解决了。因为摆在美国战争贩子面前的困难是只会增加，不会减少的。
