One Hundred and Eighty-Eight Labor Models from Licheng, Shanxi, Respond to Li Shunda's Production Increase Challenge
    In late November, our Licheng County in Shanxi Province convened a county-wide labor model conference. At the conference, one hundred and eighty-eight labor model representatives, representing one hundred and fifty-two mutual aid teams, responded to the production increase challenge issued by the Li Shunda mutual aid team. In order to achieve the goal of increased production, we have decided to ensure that every household builds fertilizer pits to open up sources of fertilizer, and that each mu of land receives thirty to forty loads of fertilizer. Secondly, we will universally promote and use the best local grain varieties, such as "White Willow Sand," "Hen's Beak," and "Glass Show." To prevent pests and diseases, we plan to mobilize the masses to prepare 90,000 jin of pesticides. In addition, we plan to irrigate all the paddy fields once this winter and dig 100 wells. Now, each mutual aid team has formulated specific production increase plans. Labor model Shi Cunjin plans for his mutual aid team to accumulate 110 dan of fertilizer per mu this winter, collect enough firewood for eight months of burning, and engage in transportation during the winter slack season. His team has also launched a chain-style patriotic production increase and conservation competition challenge to all 2,400-plus mutual aid teams in the county. We, the one hundred and eighty-eight labor models, have already written to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to achieve production increases according to the plan.

    山西黎城一百八十八个劳动模范
    向李顺达的增产挑战应战
    我们山西黎城县十一月下旬召开了一个全县的劳动模范大会，会上一百八十八个劳动模范代表一百五十二个互助组向李顺达互助组的增产竞赛挑战应了战。为了达到增产目的，我们决定做到家家建筑肥坑以开辟肥料来源，每亩地要上肥三十到四十驮；其次要普遍推广和使用我们这个地区最好的谷种“白柳沙”“母鸡嘴”“玻璃秀”等。为了防止病虫害，我们计划发动群众准备九万斤杀虫药剂；此外，今冬要把水地普浇一次，并要打井一百眼。现在各互助组都订出了具体的增产计划，劳动模范石寸金计划，他的互助组在今冬要给每亩地积肥一百一十担，要打足够八个月烧用的柴，全组要利用冬闲搞运输。他这组还向全县二千四百多个互助组发起了连环式的爱国增产节约竞赛的挑战运动。我们一百八十八个劳动模范已经给毛主席写信，保证按计划做到增产。
