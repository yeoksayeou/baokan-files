The employees of the Zhoucun Branch of the State-owned China Department Store in Shandong Province, after examining their "starting strong but finishing weak" shortcomings in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, have formulated a plan for patriotic production increase and economy, along with measures to ensure its implementation. The branch's employees had participated in several competitions before, but they often fizzled out midway. In October, after the Shandong Provincial Company of the China Department Store launched a patriotic labor competition centered on reducing commodity circulation costs, the branch's employees immediately joined in, but their enthusiasm gradually waned. In November, as in the past, the branch blindly transported over 10,000 catties of rock candy and kerosene to Diaozhen and Tianzhen without conducting any investigation or research. As a result, there were no sales, and they had to transport the goods back, tying up capital and wasting over four million yuan in transportation costs.

Before this competition, the branch, from top to bottom, examined the shortcomings of "starting strong but finishing weak." In terms of administrative leadership, they had not adequately studied how to mobilize and lead competitions in the past. A few leaders would draw up a plan, hold a meeting, make some calls, and then ignore it. Previously, because the employees did not understand the significance of the competition, they viewed it merely as the administrative leadership telling them to work harder. When this patriotic production increase and economy campaign was first proposed, many employees again thought, "It's just the same old thing." Later, after in-depth mobilization by the administration and the trade union, explaining that increasing production and practicing economy was a fundamental method for accumulating national construction funds and supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers, the employees' understanding of increasing production and practicing economy was enhanced, and their enthusiasm for participating in the competition was increased. Consequently, the employees examined their own work and formulated a production increase and economy plan for December. Each department also formulated its own plan. For example, the storage and transportation department stipulated that goods shipped from Jinan and Qingdao should be directly transported to the sales location; the accounting department guaranteed that cash would be deposited in the treasury on the same day. The employees of each department also pledged to actively attend market days to sell goods and increase sales revenue. Thus, based on mobilizing the masses, the branch formulated a plan to save 70.48 million yuan in accelerating capital turnover and reducing commodity circulation costs in December.

To ensure that the competition is carried through to the end, the branch's Communist Party branch, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League organization jointly organized a competition committee, established an inspection team and a publicity and evaluation team, and stipulated a competition inspection and summary system. The employees also included the guarantee to complete the competition plan in their personal patriotic pledges. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国百货公司周村分公司职工
    参加竞赛往往有始无终
    经过检查保证今后改正
    国营中国百货公司山东省周村分公司职工检查了爱国增产节约竞赛中“虎头蛇尾”的缺点以后，订出了爱国增产节约计划和保证贯彻实行的办法。该分公司职工曾参加过多次竞赛，但往往是有始无终。十月间中国百货公司山东省公司开展了以减低商品流转费用为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛以后，该分公司职工立即参加竞赛，但以后就逐渐消沉。十一月间，该分公司和以往一样，不经调查研究，就盲目地把一万多斤桔糖和煤油运往刁镇、田镇去，结果没有销路，只好又把这些货物运回来，积压了资金，还浪费了四百多万元运费。
    这次竞赛开展前，该分公司从上到下检查了“虎头蛇尾”的缺点：行政领导方面以往对如何发动和领导竞赛都没有很好研究，总是由几个负责人订一个计划，开一次大会，号召号召，“呼隆”一阵，以后就不管了；职工们以前由于不认识竞赛的意义，所以把竞赛看成只是行政领导方面叫多干点活罢了。这次爱国增产节约竞赛刚提出时，很多职工又看成“反正是那么回事”。后经行政和工会方面深入动员，讲明增产节约是积累国家建设资金的根本方法，是为了支援中国人民志愿军，这样，提高了职工们对增产节约的认识，并提高了大家参加竞赛的热情。于是，职工们检查了自己的工作，订出了十二月份增产节约计划。各科也订出了各科的计划。例如，储运科规定从济南和青岛发出的货物直接运到销货地点；会计科保证现金当日解库。各科职工并提出保证：主动赶集售货，扩大卖钱额。这样，在发动群众的基础上，该分公司订出了十二月份在加速资金周转和减低商品流转费用方面节约七千零四十八万元的计划。
    为了保证竞赛贯彻到底，该分公司共产党支部、行政、工会、青年团组织联合组织了竞赛委员会，设立检查组和宣传评判组，规定了竞赛的检查、总结制度。职工们并把保证完成竞赛计划列入了个人的爱国公约。    （新华社）
