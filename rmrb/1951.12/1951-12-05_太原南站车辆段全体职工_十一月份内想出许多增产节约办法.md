The entire staff of the Taiyuan South Station Rolling Stock Depot:

Enriched by patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, every employee in our depot has taken a step forward ideologically. Recently, upon seeing Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy, we were filled with boundless excitement and joy. Chairman Mao's words have inspired our production enthusiasm. Now, I report on the production situation in our depot for November as follows:

    I. We plan to utilize waste materials to revive eight vehicles, saving 5,385 catties of millet. By November 21st, six vehicles have been completed.

    II. Repair of the official vehicle (for the South Tongpu Railway). This vehicle requires repair, but sending it to the factory (Bing Da) requires an expenditure of 82,087,000 yuan. After research and planning, our depot, with the approval of the Vehicle Section, will repair it in the depot (B inspection), using an expenditure of 3,000,000 yuan, saving 79,087 catties of millet.

    III. Depot Repair of Vehicles. The task assigned by the superiors was three vehicles (in November), but thanks to the correct leadership of Section Chief Liu and the improved production efficiency of the employees, five vehicles have now been completed, and we are striving to complete seven vehicles by the end of the month, exceeding the quota by four vehicles.

    IV. The oil roll team, under the direct guidance and assistance of Comrade Wang Chungkui (inspector) in July, improved work operating methods and enhanced work capabilities. They processed the waste oil rolls stored in 1950 through an oil extraction mechanism to create raw materials, making 5,000 oil rolls and completing the 1951 annual oil roll task two months ahead of schedule.

Based on these production situations, we are continuing to unleash potential capacity, which has never happened before in the Taiyuan South Station Rolling Stock Depot. We resolutely and earnestly pledge to Chairman Mao that we will never let the fact that the South Tongpu Railway is narrow gauge and faces difficulties hinder the progress of production in our depot. We are determined to increase production, practice strict economy, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive to consolidate our beloved and great motherland.

    太原南站车辆段全体职工
    十一月份内想出许多增产节约办法
    我们太原南站车辆段全体职工，受了抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，每个职工从思想上都提高了一步。最近看见毛主席增产节约的号召，我们更是无限兴奋和愉快。毛主席的话鼓舞了我们的生产情绪。现在，把我段在十一月份的生产情况报告如下：
    一、我们计划利用废料复活八台车辆，节省小米五、三八五斤，至十一月二十一日已完成六台。
    二、修理公务车（南同蒲用）。该车需要修理，但入厂（丙大）需要经费八二、○八七、○○○元，我段经过研究计划，呈车辆科批准，由段修理（乙检），用经费三百万元，节省小米七九、○八七斤。
    三、段修车。上级交给任务是三辆（十一月份），但由于刘段长的正确领导和职工的生产效率提高，现在已完成五辆，争取月终完成七辆，超过四辆。
    四、油卷小组经过七月份王春奎同志（查标员）的直接指导帮助，改进了工作操作方法，提高了工作能力，把一九五○年所存的废旧油卷，经过甩油机制成原料，作成油卷五千个，提前两个月完成一九五一年全年油卷任务。
    根据这些生产情况，我们还正在继续发挥潜在能力，这在太原南站车辆段是从来没有的事。我们坚决地认真地向毛主席提出保证，绝不因南同蒲铁路是窄轨，有困难，而阻挡住我段生产前进。我们有决心增加生产，厉行节约，支持中国人民志愿军，为巩固我们可爱的伟大祖国而奋斗。
