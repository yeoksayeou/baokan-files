Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 26th: At the third agenda item subcommittee of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 26th, there was no progress as the other side continued to insist on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs.

    Our representative pointed out: The plan proposed by our side on December 24th suggested that during the armistice period, neither side should introduce any military personnel or war equipment, including combat aircraft, from outside of Korea. Regarding the monitoring issue, we agreed to the other side's proposal that "when either side of the Military Armistice Commission makes a request to the neutral nations' inspection agency to investigate violations of the agreement, the neutral nations' inspection agency must be responsible for conducting inspections." This demonstrates our sincerity in seeking a stable and effective armistice. The other side should no longer fear the growth of our air force and insist on its unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs.

    Despite this, the other side disregarded our peace efforts and the desire of people all over the world for both sides to strive to reach an agreement before the expiration of the military demarcation line. They still refused to adopt a consultative attitude. This shows that the other side is deliberately delaying the armistice negotiations and is unwilling to make any effort to reach an armistice agreement.

    At the fourth agenda item subcommittee, the other side continued to insist on discussing the issue of the whereabouts of prisoners who had already been released by our side, which simply does not exist, and refused to enter into a beneficial discussion of the basic principles and specific arrangements for both sides to release all prisoners of war they hold. Our representative frankly pointed out that the other side's purpose in doing so was simply to delay the negotiations. The issue raised by the other side simply does not exist. The serious question that really needs explanation is why the other side is detaining more than 44,000 of our prisoners of war with names. Our representative presented the other side with a detailed list of more than 44,000 people, demanding a full and satisfactory explanation. At the same time, we provided a written response to the other side's inquiry of December 21st regarding the whereabouts of more than 1,000 of their personnel. Our representative also handed over more than 800 letters from the other side's prisoners of war to their families.

    美方对第三项议程仍坚持干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求
    我方痛斥美方蓄意拖延停战谈判
    我要美方解释为何扣留我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城二十六日电】在二十六日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程小组委员会上，由于对方仍然坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求而毫无进展。
    我方代表指出：我方十二月二十四日提出的方案，建议双方在停战期间不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事人员及战争装备，包含作战飞机在内，并在监察问题上，同意了对方提出的“军事停战委员会中双方或一方向中立国监察机构提出调查违反协议事件的请求时，中立国监察机构即须负责进行视察”的主张，这表现了我方觅取稳定与有效停战的诚意。对方再不应对我方空军力量的生长有任何畏惧，而坚持其干涉我方内政的无理要求。
    虽然如此，对方却仍然置我方的和平努力和全世界人民希望双方努力在军事分界线有效期满前达成协议的热望于不顾，仍然拒绝采取协商的态度。这显示对方蓄意拖延停战谈判，不愿对达成停战协议作任何努力。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方仍然坚持讨论根本不存在的已为我方释放的俘虏的下落的问题，而拒绝进入双方释放其所收容的全部战俘的基本原则与具体安排的有益讨论。我方代表坦白指出对方这样做的目的，只是为了拖延谈判。对方提出来的问题是根本不存在的，而真正需要解释的严重问题，是对方为何扣留了我方四万四千余名有名有姓的战俘。我方代表向对方提出了四万四千余人的详细名单，要求对方作充分与满意的解释，同时又书面答复了对方在十二月二十一日向我方查询的一千余名对方人员的下落。我方代表并将对方战俘的八百余封家书转交对方。
