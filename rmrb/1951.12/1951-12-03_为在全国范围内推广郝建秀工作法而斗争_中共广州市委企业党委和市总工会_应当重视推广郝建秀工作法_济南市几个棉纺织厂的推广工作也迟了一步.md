The Enterprise Party Committee of the CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should actively participate in the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Guangzhou has already established a Hao Jianxiu Work Method Promotion Committee, and representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have also joined the Promotion Committee. However, some comrades fear that promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method will affect the central task (the democratic reform movement), so they have not participated in the promotion work. Comrades from the Enterprise Party Committee of the CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee told the Promotion Committee: "Promotion can be carried out without affecting the central task," which is correct, but they rarely sent people to attend the meetings of the Promotion Committee. The actual leadership of the promotion work rests solely with the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union and the administrative leading cadres and the Communist Youth League organizations in two cotton textile factories. Thanks to their active efforts, the Hao Jianxiu Work Method has been widely promoted among the spinning workers. In order to better promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, it is hoped that the Enterprise Party Committee of the CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee will strengthen the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

The administrative leading cadres of several cotton textile factories in Jinan City also simply regarded wage adjustments as the central task and did not attach importance to the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. It was not until the Municipal Enterprise Party Committee of the CPC put forward its opinions that the situation of neglecting the promotion work was changed. However, the promotion work was already a step behind. This phenomenon of opposing the central task and the promotion of advanced experience should attract the attention of the leading cadres of cotton textile factories in various regions.

    为在全国范围内推广郝建秀工作法而斗争
    中共广州市委企业党委和市总工会
    应当重视推广郝建秀工作法
    济南市几个棉纺织厂的推广工作也迟了一步
    中共广州市委员会企业党委会和广州市总工会，应当积极参加郝建秀工作法推广工作。广州市已经成立了郝建秀工作法推广委员会，市总工会的代表也参加了推广委员会。但是，有的同志害怕推广郝建秀工作法，会影响中心工作（民主改革运动），因此，就没有参加推广工作。中共广州市委员会企业党委会的同志告诉推广委员会说：“在不影响中心工作的情况下，可以进行推广”，这是对的，但他们很少派人参加过推广委员会的会议。实际领导推广工作的，只有中国纺织工会广州市委员会，和两个棉纺织厂中的行政领导干部和青年团组织。由于他们的积极努力，郝建秀工作法已在细纱工人中普遍推广开来。为了更好地推广郝建秀工作法，希望中共广州市委企业党委加强郝建秀工作法的推广工作。
    济南市的几个棉纺织厂的行政领导干部，也是单纯地把调整工资作为中心工作，而不重视推广郝建秀工作法。直到该市中共企业党委提出意见后，方才改变了不注意推广工作的情况。但是，推广工作已经晚了一步。这种把中心工作和推广先进经验对立起来的现象，应该引起各地棉纺织厂的领导干部注意。
