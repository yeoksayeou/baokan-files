    Communist Party Member Du Rongmin Actively Improves Tools
    Leading the Group to Save Over Ten Million Yuan Monthly

    Du Rongmin, a worker and Communist Party member in the engine room of Shandong Paper Mill, united all his fellow workers to create "wa lou" [Note 1]; and researched the use of waste lubricating oil, which can save the country 12.35 million yuan in wealth every month.

    Shandong Paper Mill (formerly known as Huaxing Paper Mill) has a history of thirty years. For thirty years, the "wa lou" and packing [Note 2] on the machines were imported from abroad. Later, due to the imperialist economic blockade, the source of foreign "wa lou" and packing was cut off, and the factory's inventory was gradually used up. Workers nailed and tied up the already broken "wa lou" and packing to continue production. Old worker Nie Fangcai said, "We'll make do with it!" Old worker Zhu Shaodi said, "Without 'wa lou' and packing, what can we do!" It was at this time that Du Rongmin began to be determined to unite all the workers in the group, use their brains, and overcome this difficulty.

    During the "Red May" production competition launched in the factory, there was only one "wa lou" left in the factory's inventory, and only one-fifth of a box of packing. The newly purchased "wa lou" and packing from Qingdao and Tianjin broke after only seven or eight hours of use. Du Rongmin was very anxious, he thought: "Why do they break so easily?" He began to study. And he carried the packing with him, taking it out to study whenever he had time. One day, he thought about why some rubber shoe soles are easy to break, while others are very durable. Thinking of this, he suddenly remembered that old leather belts used as shoe soles did not break, so he immediately found an old leather belt and compared it with the "wa lou" for research. He found that the fibers of the leather belt were finer and denser than the fibers of the "wa lou," so it was not easy to break. So he gathered all the workers in the group and discussed using old leather belts to make "wa lou." He explained in detail the reasons why old leather belts could be used to make "wa lou." Although everyone felt that there was some truth to it, they generally felt that: "If old leather belts could be used to make 'wa lou,' then there would be no need for factories that manufacture 'wa lou'." Du Rongmin decided to make one for everyone to see first, and immediately put forward this rationalization proposal to the administrative leaders. The administrative leaders immediately issued a lot of old leather belts to Du Rongmin for testing. Du Rongmin seized his rest time and, according to the appearance of the "wa lou," made a new "wa lou" in three days. Then he began the first experiment. All the workers in the group worked together, disassembling the machine and installing the new "wa lou." After starting the machine, Du Rongmin stared at the switch valve and both ends of the cylinder. As a result, the gas in the cylinder overflowed severely, and the first experiment failed. Some workers said, "We said it wouldn't work, but you still had to make trouble!" Some said, "If we can make it ourselves, what do we need a 'wa lou' factory for!" However, Du Rongmin took out the "wa lou" made of old leather belt from the water tank and found that it was not broken, which gave him some confidence. So he took it to compare with the foreign product and found that the main problem was that the size was wrong. Later, he measured and compared it again and again according to certain specifications, and made the "wa lou" for the second time. This time, the "wa lou" worked on the machine for six hours before gradually leaking water and gas. This greatly encouraged Du Rongmin and increased his confidence. After discussion by all the comrades in the group, it was found that the reason for the gas leak was: the manufacturing was rough, not up to standard, the size was wrong, and there was a lack of finished product processing. During the third manufacturing, all the comrades in the group started to work, measuring, cutting, and repairing. After making it, they went through measuring, flattening and other procedures, and finally held the third experiment.

    The third experiment was successful. The newly made "wa lou" has been in use for four weeks. The new "wa lou" not only does not leak gas or water, but also reduces the vibration of the water tank because the leather belt is soft. All the comrades in the group said excitedly: "The locally made product far exceeds the foreign product!" The administrative side deeply realized the infinite creativity of the working class. Du Rongmin and everyone's creation not only solved the production problem, but also saved 800,000 yuan in expenses every month. Now, Shandong Paper Mill has not only replaced the imported "wa lou" in the water tank with self-made "wa lou," but also uses self-made "wa lou" for the bottom of the tap water bucket.

    After Du Rongmin led the group to successfully manufacture "wa lou," he also led everyone to save oil. Du Rongmin discovered the waste of oil in the engine room very early, and also discovered the reason for the waste. Du Rongmin first discussed with Party member Dong Fengwu how to use waste lubricating oil to overcome waste. Later, he put forward a method to overcome waste at the group's production meeting and asked everyone to discuss it. (Especially seeking the opinions of old workers Zhu Shaodi and Nie Fangcai during the discussion.) This method immediately caused a great debate among the workers. After Du Rongmin's experiment, this method was successful. The trial use effect of each shift was also very good. At this time, Du Rongmin proposed to everyone: "The engine room will not receive oil for three months; after three months, the monthly reduction in lubricating oil will be twelve catties, cylinder oil will be six catties, and gasoline will be changed to five catties per month." This proposal was passed in the whole group. As a result, the amount of oil used was greatly reduced. In order to prevent the oil from leaking into the drain, Du Rongmin recently installed an iron tile on the cylinder to transport the leaked oil back to the oil drum. This further avoided waste. In total, 360 catties of lubricating oil and 180 catties of cylinder oil can be saved every month. Including the money saved from "wa lou" and other items, 12.35 million yuan in RMB can be saved every month.

    After Chairman Mao put forward the great call to "increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers" at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Du Rongmin and all the workers in the engine room immediately responded. They said: "The past achievements were too few. In the future, we must respond to Chairman Mao's call and make persistent efforts to increase production and practice economy." (Xu Jie, Li Xiuwen)

    [Note 1] "Wa lou" is made of rubber, commonly known as "rubber wa lou," nine inches wide, seventeen inches long, and one inch thick, rectangular, used to draw water from the steam engine into the water tank, so that it absorbs water to supply the machine.
    [Note 2] "Packing" is made of black lead powder, commonly known as "black lead powder packing." There are three types: three-point, four-point, and five-point, circular, used in steam engines for switch valves, wrong valves, and both ends of the cylinder, so that the steam in the cylinder cannot overflow.

    共产党员杜荣敏积极改进工具
    领导全组每月节约一千余万元
    山东造纸总厂引擎房工人、共产党员杜荣敏团结全体工友创造了瓦漏〔注一〕；并研究利用乏滑机油，每月可为国家节约一千二百三十五万元财富。
    山东造纸总厂（原名华兴造纸厂）已有三十年的历史。三十年来，机器上的瓦漏和盘根〔注二〕都是从国外输入。后来因为帝国主义进行经济封锁，外国瓦漏和盘根断绝了来源，厂内存货也逐渐用完。工人把已经坏了的瓦漏和盘根钉起来、绑起来进行生产。老工人聂方才说：“对付着用吧！”老工人朱少第说：“没有瓦漏和盘根，咱有什么办法！”就在这个时候，杜荣敏开始下决心团结全组工人，开动脑筋，要克服这个困难。
    在全厂开展“红五月”生产竞赛时，厂里存的瓦漏只剩下一个，盘根也仅剩下一盒五分的。新从青岛和天津买来的瓦漏和盘根，用七、八个钟头就折了。杜荣敏非常着急，他想：“为什么这么容易折？”他开始研究。并且把盘根随身带着，有空就拿出来研究。有一天他想到为什么胶鞋底有的容易折，有的却非常坚韧。想到这里，他忽然想起用旧皮带作鞋底不折的事，就马上找了一块旧皮带和瓦漏对照研究。发现皮带的纤维比瓦漏的纤维细密，所以不容易折。于是他把全组工友找来，商量用旧皮带来造瓦漏。他详细地说明了旧皮带可以制造瓦漏的理由。大家虽然也感到有些道理，但总觉得：“如果旧皮带可以造瓦漏，就用不着制造瓦漏的工厂了。”杜荣敏决定先做给大家看，就立刻向行政领导方面提出了这个合理化建议。行政领导方面马上发给了杜荣敏很多旧皮带供作试验之用。杜荣敏抓紧休息时间，依照瓦漏的样子，三天内造出了新的瓦漏。于是开始第一次试验。全组工人一齐动手，拆开机器，安装上新的瓦漏。开车后，杜荣敏目不转睛地瞅着开关汽门和汽缸两头，结果汽缸里的气，溢得很厉害，第一次试验失败。有的工人说：“咱早说不行，偏要麻烦！”有的说：“自己能造，要制瓦漏的工厂作啥！”但是，杜荣敏从水柜里取出旧皮带做的瓦漏，发现并没有折坏，还有些信心。于是拿来和外国货对比研究，发现主要毛病是尺码大小不对。后来，他又根据一定的规格量了又量，比了又比，第二次制成了瓦漏。这次制的瓦漏在机器上工作了六个钟头以后才渐渐漏水、跑汽。这给杜荣敏鼓舞很大，增强了信心。经过全组同志讨论，发现跑汽的原因是：制造的粗糙、不合规格，尺码大小不对，缺乏成品加工。在第三次制造时，全组同志都动手了，量的量，裁的裁，修理的修理。制成后，又经过测量、压平等手续，最后举行第三次试验。
    第三次试验成功了。新制的瓦漏一直使用了四个星期。新瓦漏不但不漏汽、不跑水，并因为皮带柔软，减少了水柜的震动。全组同志都兴奋地说：“土造货大大超过外国货！”行政方面更深地体会到工人阶级的无限创造性。杜荣敏和大家的创造，既解决了生产问题，又节省了每月八十万元的开支。现在，山东造纸总厂不仅在引水柜里换上了自造瓦漏，连自来水桶底也用了自造瓦漏。
    杜荣敏领导全组制造瓦漏成功以后，又领导大家节约用油。杜荣敏很早就发现引擎房用油有些浪费，并且发现了浪费的原因。杜荣敏先和党员董凤武商量了怎样利用乏滑机油，克服浪费现象的办法。以后，又在全组生产会议上提出克服浪费的办法，请大家讨论。（讨论时特别征求了老工人朱少第和聂方才的意见。）这个办法立即在工友中间引起了很大的争论。经过杜荣敏的试验，这个办法获得了成功。各班试用效果也都很好。这时，杜荣敏向大家提出：“引擎房三个月不领油；三个月以后，每月减领滑机油十二斤、汽缸油六斤，汽油每月改用五斤。”这一建议在全组通过了。这一来，用油量大大减少。为了不使油漏到匿水槽里，杜荣敏最近又在汽缸上装置了一个铁瓦，把漏下来的油再输送到油桶里。这就进一步地避免了浪费。总计每月可节省滑机油三百六十斤，汽缸油一百八十斤，连节省瓦漏等的价钱计算在内，每月可节省人民币一千二百三十五万元。
    毛主席在人民政协全国委员会第三次会议上提出“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召以后，杜荣敏和引擎房的全体工友立即响应。他们说：“过去成绩太少了，今后要响应毛主席的号召，再接再厉，增产节约。”（徐杰、李修文）
    〔注一〕“瓦漏”是橡胶制成的，俗称“胶皮瓦漏”，宽九寸、长十七寸，厚一寸，长方形，用于汽力机引水入水柜内，使其吸水供给机器使用。
    〔注二〕“盘根”是黑铅粉制成的，俗称“黑铅粉盘根”。在汽力机上用三分、四分、五分三种，圆形。用于开关汽门、错汽门、汽缸两头，使汽缸的汽不能溢出。
