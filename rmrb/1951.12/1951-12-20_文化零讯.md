    ▲ The "East China Peasant" bi-monthly magazine, targeting rural cadres and 110 million peasants in the East China region, was launched on December 1st and sold 400,000 copies.

In addition to organizing the masses to listen, local radio stations have also created mimeographed newspapers and blackboard newspapers for the masses to study, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses.
