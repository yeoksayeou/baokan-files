Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, December 2nd: The people of Southern Jiangsu have pre-emptively exceeded the original plan to complete the half-year production increase and donation of 120 fighter planes to establish the "Southern Jiangsu Air Force Division." As of November 30th, the people of the entire region had contributed a total of 196,280,038,000+ yuan, enough to purchase 130 fighter planes, exceeding the original plan by over 9%. Currently, people from all walks of life in Southern Jiangsu are channeling their patriotism into the production increase and economy drive, continuing to strive to strengthen the forces of resistance against America and aid Korea and the forces of economic construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 2nd: The people of Jiangxi Province have pre-emptively exceeded the plan to increase production and donate 81 fighter planes in half a year. By the end of November, the actual donations paid by the people of the province had reached 122,462,725,492 yuan, exceeding the original total donation amount by 0.8%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 2nd: After pre-emptively exceeding the half-year plan to donate 81 fighter planes, the people of Jiangxi Province are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and are formulating production increase and economy plans for the remainder of this year. All employees of a machine factory where Jiangxi's famous industrial model worker Chou Yeh-heng works, wrote to Chairman Mao on November 28th, reporting on the achievements of the patriotic production competition over the past year, and drawing up a plan for December to increase production and save 292.3 million yuan by improving technology and reducing waste. Workers in other factories, mines, and enterprises are also discussing specific ways to increase production and save money. Farmers in various counties across the province, after completing the donation plan, are revising patriotic pacts with a focus on expanding the winter planting area. For example, the Chou Hsiang-chi mutual aid team in Chayuan Village, Pingxiang County, decided to plant all 44 mu of dry land suitable for winter planting with wheat, rapeseed, peas, and green manure crops. Farmers in the Fourth District of Jinxian County completed the district's winter plowing plan in five days, and most of the land was plowed twice, with rice roots dug out and burned as fertilizer. It is estimated that the province's winter planting area will double this year compared to last year, laying the groundwork for next year's patriotic production campaign.

    苏南江西完成捐献
    转入增产节约运动
    【新华社无锡二日电】苏南区人民已提前超额完成半年增产捐献战斗机一百二十架、成立“苏南空军师”的原订计划。截至十一月三十日止，全区人民已缴纳献款一千九百六十二亿八千零三十八万多元，可以购买一百三十架战斗机，超过原计划百分之九强。目前苏南各界人民正将他们的爱国主义热情贯彻到增产节约运动中去，继续为加强抗美援朝力量和经济建设力量而努力。
    【新华社南昌二日电】江西省人民已提前超额完成半年增产捐献战斗机八十一架的计划。到十一月底为止，全省人民实缴献款已达一千二百二十四亿六千二百七十二万五千四百九十二元，超过原订捐献总额百分之零点八。
    【新华社南昌二日电】江西省人民提前超额完成半年捐献战斗机八十一架的计划后，正热烈响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，订立今年年底以前的增产节约计划。江西省著名工业劳动模范仇业衡工作的某机器厂全体职工，曾在十一月二十八日写信给毛主席，报告一年来爱国主义生产竞赛的成绩，并订出十二月份从改进技术减少废品方面，增产节约二亿九千二百三十万元的计划。其他各个工厂、矿山、企业的工人，也都在讨论增产节约的具体办法。全省各县完成捐献计划后的农民，都以扩大冬种面积为中心，修订爱国公约。如萍乡县茶垣村周象基互助组决定把可以冬种的四十四亩旱田，全部种上小麦、油菜、豌豆、肥田草。进贤县第四区农民五天内完成全区冬耕田亩计划，并大部都耕了两遍，把禾根掘出来烧成肥料。估计今年全省冬种面积比去年增加一倍，为明年的爱国生产运动作好了准备工作。
