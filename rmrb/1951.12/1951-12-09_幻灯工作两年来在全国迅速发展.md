Slide projector work, a new undertaking in social and cultural endeavors, has been rapidly developing throughout the country in the past two years due to the enthusiastic welcome it has received from the broad masses.

According to incomplete statistics at the end of October, there are a total of 9,943 slide projectors distributed across the country. In 1950, the total number of slide projector viewers nationwide reached approximately 80 million. In Beijing, the "Resist America, Aid Korea Slide Projector Propaganda Week" held this year screened slides 63 times, with over 118,000 viewers, averaging over 1,800 viewers per screening. Large-scale slide projector screenings have also been held in Shanghai, Baoding, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Changsha, and other places. It is estimated that the number of slide projector viewers across the country this year exceeds 200 million.

The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government attaches great importance to slide projector work. The Science Popularization Bureau of the ministry established the Electrified Education Tool Manufacturing Plant in April last year, specializing in the production of slide projectors and slides. The Nanjing Instrument Manufacturing Plant, affiliated with the Science Popularization Bureau, has also focused on the production of slide projectors for over a year. Over the past year, the Electrified Education Tool Manufacturing Plant and the Nanjing Instrument Manufacturing Plant, through research and continuous improvement, have produced over a hundred slides and various slide projectors suitable for rural conditions. The most popular slides among the masses include "A Century of American Imperialist Aggression Against China," "The Fury of Resisting America and Aiding Korea," "Oppose American Imperialism's Arming of Japan," "Seven Little Heroes," and some films related to maternal and child health. Currently, there are sixteen institutions nationwide specializing in the manufacture of slide projectors and fifteen institutions manufacturing slides. In addition, many cultural, educational, and propaganda organizations in various regions have dedicated personnel to draw slides. However, the production of slide projectors and slides still cannot meet the actual demand.

In order to promote slide projector work, the Southwest Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the provinces of Hebei, Pingyuan, Suiyuan, Songjiang, and Tianjin have all held slide projector work training classes. The East China Region, and the provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang, Hebei, Chahar, and the cities of Beijing and Nanjing have all held symposiums or discussion meetings on slide projector work. The Science Popularization Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government convened a slide projector work discussion meeting in October last year, mainly involving five provinces and two cities in North China. The meeting determined that the general direction of slide projector work development should be to prioritize popularization; the content of slide projector work should mainly be to cooperate with current political movements to conduct patriotic and internationalist education among the broad masses of people, and to cooperate with production and construction to popularize scientific knowledge.

The development of slide projector work in the past two years has proven that slide projectors are a powerful tool for popularizing political, current affairs, cultural, scientific, health, and other forms of propaganda and education among the broad masses. Because slide projectors are simple to manufacture and project, and convenient to carry. Moreover, slides can be based on the central work of each region, locally sourced, and produced in a timely manner to educate the masses in light of their thinking. In mass movements such as resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and in production work, the slides produced in conjunction with reality in various regions have played a significant educational role for the local masses. During slide projector screenings, the pace can be adjusted at will, and appropriate explanations, music, clapper talks, ventriloquism, etc. can be added, making it easy for the masses to understand and very suitable for the current acceptance capacity of many working people. When the Central People's Government's visiting delegation to the ethnic minorities of Central and Southern China visited the Yao ethnic region in Longsheng County, Guangxi, they screened slides. After watching slides about resisting America and aiding Korea, the Yao masses immediately and spontaneously donated money or gold and silver jewelry to purchase airplanes and cannons. The slide projector screening team in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, drew slides such as "The Upsurge of the Weeding and Aphid Prevention Movement," "Commending Models," and "Criticizing Slackers" in the work of weeding and preventing cotton aphids, projecting real people and real events, and introducing scientific knowledge to improve production. After the slide projector screenings, men and women in each village competed to participate in weeding. Fan Suicheng's wife from Xiliang Village, who was criticized in the slides, worked very hard at weeding the next day and asked to have the slides about her removed in the evening.

Slide projector screening work is still constantly developing. In order to ensure the correct development of this work, cultural and educational institutions in various regions should strengthen ideological leadership over slide projector work, train a group of slide projector work talents; and should plan to expand the production of slide projectors and new slides, and improve the ideological and artistic level of the slides.

### 幻灯工作两年来在全国迅速发展

    幻灯工作两年来在全国迅速发展
    社会文化事业中新兴的幻灯放映工作，因为受到广大群众的热烈欢迎，两年来在全国各地发展极迅速。
    根据十月底的不完全的统计，分布在全国各地的幻灯机共有九千九百四十三架。一九五○年全国的幻灯观众约达八千万人。北京市今年举行的“抗美援朝幻灯宣传周”，曾放映幻灯六十三次，观众达十一万八千多人，平均每次有观众一千八百多人。上海、保定、唐山、秦皇岛、长沙等地都曾举行大规模的幻灯放映。据估计，今年全国各地的幻灯观众有两亿多人。
    中央人民政府文化部很重视幻灯工作。该部科学普及局在去年四月设立了电化教育工具制造所，专门制造幻灯机和幻灯片。科学普及局所属的南京仪器制造厂一年多来也以制造幻灯机为工作重点。电化教育工具制造所和南京仪器制造厂一年多来经过研究和不断改进，曾制造了一百多部幻灯片和各种适合农村条件的幻灯机。最受群众欢迎的幻灯片有“美帝侵华百年史”、“抗美援朝的怒火”、“反对美帝武装日本”、“七个小英雄”和一些有关妇婴卫生的片子。目前全国各地有专门制造幻灯机的机构十六处，制造幻灯片的机构十五处。此外，各地有很多文化教育和宣传机关设有专人，绘制幻灯片。但是幻灯机和幻灯片的制造，还是供应不上实际需要。
    为了推动幻灯工作，西南区，内蒙古自治区，河北、平原、绥远、松江等省和天津市都举行过幻灯工作训练班。华东区，山东、浙江、河北、察哈尔等省和北京、南京两市都举行过关于幻灯工作的座谈会或讨论会。中央人民政府文化部科学普及局在去年十月召开了以华北五省二市为主的幻灯工作讨论会。会议确定了幻灯工作发展的总方向是普及为主；幻灯工作的内容主要地应该是配合当前政治运动向广大人民进行爱国主义与国际主义教育，和配合生产建设普及科学知识。
    两年来幻灯工作的发展，证明了幻灯是在广大群众间普及政治、时事、文化、科学、卫生等各种宣传教育的有力工具。因为幻灯的制造、放映都很简便，携带也方便。而且幻灯片可以根据各地中心工作，就地取材，及时制作，针对群众思想进行教育。各地在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等群众运动和生产工作中，结合实际制作的幻灯片，对当地群众都起了很大的教育作用。幻灯在放映时，还可以随意快慢，配合适当的解说或音乐、快板、口技等，群众容易看得懂，很适合目前许多劳动人民的接受能力。中央人民政府中南各民族访问团在广西龙胜县徭族地区访问时，曾放映幻灯。徭族群众在看过有关抗美援朝的幻灯片后，马上自动捐款，或捐金银手饰来购买飞机大炮。平原省安阳县的幻灯放映队在除草防棉蚜的工作中，绘制了“防草除蚜运动的热潮”、“表扬模范”、“批评懒汉”等幻灯片，把真人真事放映出来，并介绍了提高生产的科学知识。在幻灯放映后，各村男男女女都争先恐后地参加除草。在幻灯片上受到批评的西梁村范遂成的老婆，第二天就很卖劲除草，并在晚上要求把关于她的片子去掉。
    幻灯放映工作目前仍在不断地发展，为了保证这一工作的正确开展，各地文化教育机关应该加强对幻灯工作的思想领导，训练一批幻灯工作人材；并应该有计划地扩大幻灯机和新幻灯片的制作，提高幻灯片的思想水平和艺术水平。（新华社）
