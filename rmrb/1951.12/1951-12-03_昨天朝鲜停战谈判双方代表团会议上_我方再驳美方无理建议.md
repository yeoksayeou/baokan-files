Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 2nd: At yesterday's meeting of the delegations from both sides of the Korean Armistice Talks, our side's representatives continued to refute the unreasonable proposals and demands made by the other side in the discussion of the third agenda item. Our side's representatives pointed out: While the other side claims to advocate restricting the import of armed forces, military equipment, and supplies from outside Korea during the armistice period to reduce the possibility of renewed hostilities, they insist on allowing the rotation of foreign troops and the replenishment of weapons and ammunition, and insist on retaining their armed forces on the islands behind our lines, making it possible for hostilities to break out again at any time. Such self-contradictory proposals and demands can only lead to suspicion as to whether the real purpose of the other side's so-called restrictions on the import of armed forces, military equipment, and supplies from outside Korea is truly to reduce the possibility of renewed hostilities. Our side's representatives reiterated: The other side's so-called proposal to restrict military equipment and their demand for supervisory agencies to have free access to all parts of Korea is obviously a blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which our side can never tolerate, nor is it a matter that should be involved in military armistice negotiations. The Korean people have every right to build and strengthen their own defense equipment during the armistice period without interference from others, and the Korean people absolutely cannot allow the other side to have free access to all territories of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for so-called "inspections" and "reconnaissance." Our side pointed out: Unless the other side abandons these unreasonable proposals and demands that our side can absolutely not accept, the discussion of the third agenda item will not be able to reach an agreement, and the responsibility for the delay in the armistice negotiations will lie entirely with the other side.

    昨天朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团会议上
    我方再驳美方无理建议
    除非对方放弃我方绝不能接受的无理建议和要求，第三项议程将无从达成协议，而停战谈判的拖延责任将完全在于对方。
    【新华社开城二日电】二日的朝鲜停战谈判的双方代表团会议上，我方代表继续驳斥对方在第三项议程的讨论中所提出的无理建议与要求。我方代表指出：对方一方面声称主张在停战期间限制自朝鲜境外输入武装力量与军事装备和供应，以减少敌对行为再度爆发的可能，另一方面却又坚持允许外国军队的轮换与武器弹药的补充，并坚持在我方后方的岛屿上保留对方的武装部队，使敌对行为随时可以再度爆发。这种自相矛盾的建议与要求，只能令人怀疑对方建议所谓限制自朝鲜境外输入武装力量与军事装备和供应的真正目的，是否真正在于减少敌对行为再度爆发的可能性。我方代表再度指出：对方所提出的所谓限制军事设备的建议与监督机构自由出入朝鲜一切部分的要求，显然是露骨地干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政，绝非我方所能容忍，亦绝非军事停战谈判所应涉及的问题。朝鲜人民有一切的权利在停战期间修建与加强自己的防御设备，不容他人过问，朝鲜人民也绝对不能容许对方自由出入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全境，进行所谓“视察”与“侦察”。我方指出：除非对方放弃这些我方所绝对不能接受的无理建议与要求，第三项议程的讨论将无从达成协议，而停战谈判之拖延，其责任将完全在于对方。
