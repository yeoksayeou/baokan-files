To the Editor:

    Leading cadres of the Business Department of the Shandong Office of the East China Industrial Department do not comply with the cash management system. In July, when Hu Qinggong of the Transportation Section of the Business Department went to Guangzhou on official business, many leading cadres in the department, because watches were cheaper in Guangzhou, misappropriated public funds to commission Hu Qinggong to purchase watches. Hu Qinggong returned with twelve watches, including those for Director Sun of the Business Department and Section Chief Zhang of the Transportation Section. Staff in the department have widely expressed: Lower-level staff should comply with cash management, but responsible cadres are not subject to this rule. Some said:
    "Section Chief Zhang previously reported that he had difficulties, so how does he have money to buy a watch this time!" Group Leader Lu of the Secretariat once mentioned to Director Sun the reactions of the masses regarding this matter. Director Sun said, "Cadres buy watches to better manage time in their work, I don't think there will be any problems." After the masses raised criticisms in the wall newspaper, Section Chief Leng of the Accounting Section, due to responsibility, urged those who had watches brought back to quickly repay the loans. As a result, some borrowed money from friends to repay, while others, citing economic difficulties, requested to borrow money from the public to repay the watch money. I believe that the leading cadres of the Business Department should deeply examine and correct this bad habit of blurring the line between public and private.

    华东工业部山东办事处经营处
    领导干部有公私不分的行为
    编辑同志：华东工业部山东办事处经营处领导干部不遵守现金管理制度。七月份，经营处运输科胡庆功因公出发到广州，处里很多领导干部因广州表价便宜，都移用公款委托胡庆功购买手表。胡庆功回来时带了十二只手表，其中有经营处孙处长、运输科张科长的。处里工作人员纷纷反映：下级人员应该遵守现金管理，负责干部不在此例。有的说：
    “张科长前曾打报告说有困难，怎么这次买表就有钱啦！”秘书室吕组长曾对孙处长说起群众关于这件事的反应，孙处长说：“干部买表是为了在工作中便于掌握时间，我想这事不会有什么问题。”自群众在壁报栏提出批评后，会计科冷科长因责任关系，催促捎表的人赶快还借款。于是，有的人找朋友借钱还了，有的人则藉口经济困难，要求向公家借款还表钱。我认为经营处领导干部应深刻检讨，纠正这种公私不分的坏作风。    任玉书
