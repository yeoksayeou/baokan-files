Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 14th, discussing and adopting the recommendation previously unanimously passed by the General Committee to include the Soviet Union's proposal accusing the United States of subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies on the agenda of the General Assembly. The title of the Soviet proposal is: "Aggressive Actions by the United States of America and Interference in the Internal Affairs of Other Countries - manifested by the appropriation of one hundred million dollars as funds for recruiting personnel and organizing armed groups within the territory of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and certain other democratic countries, and outside these countries' territories."

During the discussion, the US representative had no way to oppose the inclusion of this proposal on the agenda and was forced to declare that the United States did not object to the discussion of this proposal. However, he put forward an unusual procedural motion, demanding that this proposal bypass the Political Committee and be discussed directly by the plenary session.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke at the meeting, stating the reasons for the Soviet Union's proposal and refuting the unreasonable attitude of the United States. Vyshinsky cited the "Mutual Security Act of 1951" passed by the United States on October 10th, and cited the recent incidents of US military aircraft invading Romanian and Hungarian airspace, convincingly proving that the purpose of the "Mutual Security Act of 1951," which allocated one hundred million dollars to espionage organizations, was to carry out terrorist subversive and destructive activities in the Soviet Union and people's democracies. He pointed out that the US government and its agencies are planning to recruit or have already recruited traitors who have betrayed their country to serve as spies. The Soviet Union suggested that the General Assembly discuss this issue because such laws and such actions constitute a threat to peace.

Vyshinsky denounced the unusual procedural motion put forward by the US representative to discuss this issue. He said that precisely because this issue is of great political significance, it needs to be considered truly carefully. A review by the Political Committee, followed by a review by the plenary session, will fully guarantee this. The Soviet government believes that this issue is extremely important and deserves serious attention. The Soviet delegation requested the General Assembly to adopt the General Committee's recommendation.

The Pakistani representative also opposed the US proposal. The US representative originally wanted to obstruct the Political Committee's discussion of the Soviet Union's accusation, but later, seeing that no one supported him, he had to withdraw his proposal. The General Committee's recommendation was passed by an overwhelming majority.

    在联合国大会全体会议上
    维辛斯基痛斥美国干涉他国内政
    苏联控诉美国侵略行动案列入联大议程
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会于十四日举行全体会议，讨论并通过了总务委员会以前所一致通过的建议，把苏联控诉美国对苏联和各人民民主国家进行颠覆与破坏活动的提案列入大会议程。苏联提案的题目是：“美利坚合众国的侵略行动及对其他国家内政的干涉——表现为拨款一亿美元作为经费，在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和其他的某些民主国家境内及这些国家领土之外招募人员，并组织武装集团。”
    在讨论中，美国代表没有办法反对把这项提案列入议程，只好被迫宣称美国不反对讨论这项提案，但是，他提出了一个违反常例的讨论程序，要求把这个提案绕过政治委员会而迳由全体会议讨论。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在会上发言陈述苏联提出提案的理由，并驳斥美国的无理态度。维辛斯基举出了美国在十月十日通过的“一九五一年共同安全法”，并且举出了最近美国军用飞机侵入罗马尼亚和匈牙利领空的事件，令人信服地证明，“一九五一年共同安全法”规定拨款一亿美元给间谍组织的目的，就是要在苏联和人民民主国家进行恐怖颠覆破坏活动。他指出，美国政府和它的代理机构正在计划招募或者已经招募了那些背叛他们祖国的卖国贼来充当间谍。苏联建议大会讨论这个问题，是因为这种法律和这种行动构成了对和平的威胁。
    维辛斯基痛斥美国代表所提出的违反常例的讨论这个问题的程序。他说，正因为这个问题具有极大的政治意义，所以需要真正仔细的考虑，在政治委员会审议后再由全体会议审议，才能完全保证做到这一点。苏联政府认为这个问题极为重要，应该得到严重的注意。苏联代表团要求大会通过总务委员会的建议。
    巴基斯坦代表也反对美国的建议。美国代表原来想阻挠政治委员会讨论苏联的控诉案，但是，后来因为看到没有人支持他，不得不撤销了他的建议。总务委员会的建议以绝大多数票获得通过。
