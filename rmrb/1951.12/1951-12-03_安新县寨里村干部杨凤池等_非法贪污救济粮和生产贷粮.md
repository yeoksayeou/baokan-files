    Village Cadres in Zhai Li Village, Anxin County, Yang Fengchi, etc., Illegally Embezzle Relief Grain and Production Loan Grain

    The illegal embezzlement of relief grain and production loan grain by village cadres Yang Fengchi, Liu Jisheng, Zhao Lianqing, etc., in Zhai Li Village, First District, Anxin County, Hebei Province, has caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. This year, among the relief grain and production loan grain distributed by the Anxin County People's Government to the farmers of Zhai Li Village, some of the grain was relatively damp. In order to compensate for this defect, the government specially allocated a portion of grain to be distributed to the farmers. However, this additional grain was embezzled by village cadres such as Yang Fengchi. The accounting is as follows: the first embezzlement was over 600 catties, and the second was over 400 catties. The masses in the village are very dissatisfied with this matter, and there is much discussion behind the scenes, which has greatly affected the prestige of the People's Government. It is hoped that the local People's Government will promptly handle the embezzlement of Yang Fengchi and others, and publicly announce the results of the handling to the masses.

    安新县寨里村干部杨凤池等
    非法贪污救济粮和生产贷粮
    河北省安新县第一区寨里村村干部杨凤池、刘济生、赵连清等非法贪污救济粮和生产贷粮，引起群众很大不满。今年安新县人民政府发放给寨里村农民的救济粮和生产贷粮中，有的粮食比较潮湿，政府为了弥补这一缺陷，特另拨出一部分粮食发给农民。但这部分补加的粮食却被村干部杨凤池等贪污了。计：第一次贪污六百余斤，第二次四百余斤。该村群众对此事非常不满，背后议论纷纷，使人民政府威信受到很大影响。希望当地的人民政府对杨凤池等的贪污行为，抓紧进行处理，并公开向群众宣布处理结果。        潘文敏
