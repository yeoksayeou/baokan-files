    Professor Qiu Chun of Normal University Should Correct His Learning Attitude

    We, the second-year students of the Education Department of Beijing Normal University, in order to actively offer opinions and help teachers study during the teacher ideological remolding study, and to be a strong assistant in their studies, launched a series of informal discussions in groups. When talking about Professor Qiu Chun, the students believed that Professor Qiu Chun had quite serious problems in ideology and teaching. Professor Qiu Chun was deeply influenced by European and American bourgeois educational thought. He once called himself a general store in a small alley, having everything you could want. He praised so-called "academic freedom," but did not recognize its hypocrisy and harm. He divided academic research into three schools: the ant school—objectivists, the spider school—subjectivists, and the bee school—synthesists. He mistakenly attributed the great Marx and Lenin to the last school. This alone shows the confusion of his thoughts. He also said: "To be a bee school, one must have great talent; I only want to gain a small position in the ant school, and if you want to be an ant school, come to me." He also said: "Viewpoints are easy, materials are hard to find. In the past two years, your viewpoints are almost the same." Therefore, when assigning homework, he asked students to copy, the more the better.

    Professor Qiu Chun is ideologically resistant to progress. When talking about the Soviet Union's advanced teaching method, "classroom discussion," he said: "This method has long existed in capitalist countries." This affected the students' views on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. He is not serious about learning, saying: "You can tell me after you read the new books (referring to Marxist-Leninist theoretical books)." When students asked him about his views on this teacher study movement, he said: "You ask me to listen to reports, and I will listen; you ask me to read documents, and I will read." Professor Qiu Chun is not modest about this study, and at the same time, he does not yet have a clear understanding of the meaning and purpose of the study movement.

    Professor Qiu Chun also has a serious sense of national inferiority and the thought of worshiping Europe and the United States. When talking about ancient Athenian culture, he said: "Athenian culture is much older than Chinese culture. In any case, China can only rank second or third. The more museums I visit abroad, the clearer my assessment of Chinese culture becomes. It is really hard for me to talk about patriotic education, I have a sense of inferiority in this regard."

    Professor Qiu Chun's teaching thoughts, viewpoints, and positions are contrary to today's New Democratic education policy. He has had a very bad influence on the students in our class. Some students have been confused by his remarks, thinking that they have no talent, so they should be "little ants"! As a result, they spend all day in the library and are too lazy to participate in any activities, creating a tendency to ignore politics and focus solely on professional work. We put forward these opinions, hoping that Professor Qiu Chun will actively transform himself in this study, so as to undertake the important task of cultivating the younger generation of the motherland.

### 师范大学邱椿教授应纠正学习态度

    师范大学邱椿教授应纠正学习态度
    我们北京师范大学教育系二年级的同学，为了在教师思想改造的学习中，积极地提供意见，帮助教师们学习，做他们学习中的有力助手，曾以小组为单位展开了漫谈。在谈到邱椿教授时，同学们认为邱椿教授在思想上和教学上都存在着相当严重的问题。邱椿教授受欧美资产阶级教育思想的影响很深。他曾自称是小胡同中的杂货摊，要什么有什么。他歌颂所谓“学术自由”，但并未认识到它的虚伪性和危害性。他把学术研究分为三派：即蚂蚁派——客观主义者、蜘蛛派——主观主义者和蜜蜂派——综合派。他错误地把伟大的马克思、列宁都归属于最后一派。这一点就可说明了他的思想的混乱。他还说：“要作蜜蜂派，非要有很高的天才不可；我只想在蚂蚁派中得一点小小的地位，你们要作蚂蚁派，就来找我。”他又说：“观点容易，材料难找，两年来，你们的观点也差不多了。”因此，他在布置作业时，就叫同学抄袭，抄得越多越好。
    邱椿教授在思想上是抗拒进步的。谈起苏联的先进教学法“课堂讨论”时，他说：“这种方法，资本主义国家很早就有了。”这样就影响了同学对苏联先进经验的看法。他对学习是不认真的，他说：“新的书籍（指马克思列宁主义的理论书籍），你们看了告诉我。”当同学们问起他对这次教师学习运动的看法时，他说：“你们叫我听报告，就听；看文件，就看。”邱椿教授对这次学习是不虚心的，同时对学习运动的意义和目的还没有明确的认识。
    邱椿教授还存在着严重的民族自卑感和崇拜欧美的思想，在讲到古代雅典文化时，他说：“雅典文化要比中国古老得多，无论如何中国只能排在第二或第三。我在国外跑的博物馆越多，对中国文化的估计也就越清楚。要我讲爱国主义教育实在讲不来，在这方面我是有自卑感的。”
    邱椿教授的教学思想、观点、立场都是与今天新民主主义的教育方针相违背的，他已在我们班里的同学中产生了很坏影响，有些同学被他的说法弄糊涂了，以为自己没有天才，还是做个“小蚂蚁”吧！于是他们整天钻在图书馆里，一切活动都懒得参加，造成了不问政治，单纯注意业务的偏向。我们提出这些意见，希望邱椿教授在这次学习中积极改造自己，以担负起培养祖国青年一代的重大任务。
