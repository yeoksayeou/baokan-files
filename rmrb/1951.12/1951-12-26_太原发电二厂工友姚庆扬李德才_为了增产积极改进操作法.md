    Yao Qingyang and Li Decai, Workers at Taiyuan No. 2 Power Plant, Actively Improve Operational Methods for Increased Production
    To the Editor: The Yao Qingyang team at the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau's No. 2 Power Plant implemented the "Three Diligences" operational method—diligent research, diligent inspection, and diligent adjustment—creating a new record of 0.88 kilograms of coal consumption per kilowatt-hour. In the boiler workshop, a certain boiler could not carry much electrical load in the past. Labor model Li Decai and others identified the cause: low wind pressure and a thick coal layer prevented the coal's heat energy from being fully utilized. They broke with the old methods and thinned the coal layer to four and a half inches, enabling them to carry an additional 500 kilowatts of electricity per hour, increasing production by 144,000 jin of millet in November.

    太原发电二厂工友姚庆扬李德才
    为了增产积极改进操作法
    编辑同志：太原电业局发电二厂姚庆扬班实行勤研究、勤检查、勤调整的三勤操作法，创造了每度电耗煤零点八八公斤的新纪录。锅炉车间某号锅炉过去不能多带电，劳动模范李德才等找出了它的原因：风压小，煤层厚，使煤的热力不能完全发挥出来。他们便打破老办法，把煤层改薄为四寸半，这样每小时便能多带五百瓩电，使十一月份增产了十四万四千斤小米。    王桂林
