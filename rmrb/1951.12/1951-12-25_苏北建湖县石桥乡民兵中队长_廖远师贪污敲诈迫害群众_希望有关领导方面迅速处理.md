    Editor: Liao Yuanshi, militia captain of Shiqiao Township, Qingfeng District, Jianhu County, Northern Jiangsu, has consistently embezzled, extorted, and persecuted the masses.

    After Liao Yuanshi served as the chairman of the farmers' association in Lurong Village, Shiqiao Township in 1947, he was sent to the county for legal action due to embezzlement and corruption, and was later released on bail. A few days later, Liao Yuanshi became the head of Shiqiao Township. Thereupon, he said to the masses: "The more you sue me, the bigger my official position becomes. Let’s see how fierce you can be!" Soon, he was demoted to militia captain of Shiqiao Township, but his behavior only worsened. In May 1950, Liao Yuanshi "borrowed" two *hu* of rice from each of the households of Zhang Youxue, Zhang Youcai, Zhang Youhong, Liu Wanyou, Liu Wancai, and Liao Kaiyin in Lurong Village, and has not returned a single grain to this day. In February of the same year, Liao Yuanshi also privately misappropriated 300 *jin* of rice from the farmers' association, and has not returned a single grain either. He also "borrowed" four *shi* of rice from Liu Wanyou to "buy cattle for the village head," which has not been returned either. He forcibly occupied three *shi* of rice from Wu Huaigui's family and also privately sold public land. In addition, Liao Yuanshi's acts of throwing his weight around are numerous: In 1949, he beat Liao Wenhua's wife; in September 1950, he illegally detained Wu Kaixiao, a military family member; this March, when Chen Guobing's mother (a military family member) was experiencing financial difficulties, Liao Yuanshi not only did not help solve the problem, but also scolded her severely. Liao Yuanshi has also persecuted martyr family member Jiang Zhaoyou and others. It is common for Liao Yuanshi to buy things from the local small shop in the village without paying. When Wu Kaigui from this village went to another place, Liao Yuanshi raped Wu Kaigui's wife.

    For the sake of being responsible to the revolution, we are specifically exposing the above situation. We hope that the higher-level government, the Party, or the County People's Supervisory Committee will promptly investigate and handle this matter.

    苏北建湖县石桥乡民兵中队长
    廖远师贪污敲诈迫害群众
    希望有关领导方面迅速处理
    编辑同志：苏北建湖县庆丰区石桥乡民兵中队长廖远师，一贯贪污敲诈、迫害群众。
    廖远师在一九四七年任石桥乡禄荣村农会会长后，因贪污、腐化，被送县法办，后交保释放了。没有几天，廖远师就做起石桥乡乡长来，于是，他对群众说：“你们愈告，我的官愈大。看你们有多凶！”不久，他被降为石桥乡民兵中队长，但是他的作风也更坏了。一九五○年五月，廖远师向禄荣村张友学、张友才、张友洪、刘万友、刘万才、廖开银等户，各借稻二斛，到现在一粒没有还。同年二月，廖远师又私自挪支农会的稻子三百斤，现在也一粒没有还。他又向刘万友“借稻”四石给“村长买牛”，也没有还。他强占了吴淮贵家的稻子三石，还私自出卖公地。另外，廖远师作威作福的事情还不少：一九四九年，他打过廖文华的妻子；一九五○年九月，他非法关押过军属吴开晓；今年三月，陈国兵的母亲（军属）生活困难，廖远师不只不帮助解决，反而把她大骂一顿。廖远师又迫害过烈属姜兆友等。廖远师在本庄小店中买东西不给钱，更是常事。本村的吴开贵到外地去，廖远师就强奸吴开贵的妻子。
    为了对革命负责，我们特别揭发上面这些情形。我们希望上级政府，党或县人民监察委员会迅速调查处理。
