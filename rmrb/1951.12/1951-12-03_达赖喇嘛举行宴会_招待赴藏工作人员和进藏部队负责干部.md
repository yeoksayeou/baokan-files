Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 2nd: The Dalai Lama hosted a banquet on November 19th in the Norbulingka (park) of Lhasa to welcome the staff sent to Tibet by the Central People's Government and the leading cadres of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet. More than 90 people attended the banquet. The Sijue (Acting Regent) of the Tibetan local government represented the Dalai Lama in hosting the guests. Also attending the banquet were the Kalons and Chikhyab Khenpos and other principal secular and religious officials of the Tibetan local government. Before the banquet, the Dalai Lama personally received the guests at the Kundeling Palace (palace built by the 13th Dalai Lama). At the beginning of the banquet, Sijue Lobsang Tashi read a welcome speech on behalf of the Dalai Lama, saying: "In order to expel imperialist aggressor forces and consolidate national defense, the Han and Tibetan nationalities have united under this common goal. The staff of the Central People's Government and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, for the happiness of the Tibetan people, have traveled far and wide, overcoming various difficulties, and have arrived safely in Lhasa one after another. I, the Dalai Lama, am deeply gratified. Many facts prove that you value the interests of the Tibetan people more than your own lives, and you also respect me, the Dalai Lama, and all Living Buddhas very much. Not only are all the secular and religious officials very happy about this, but I, the Dalai Lama, am also very happy. I have specially sent Sijue and the General Khenpo as my representatives to entertain everyone and to read my remarks." After reading, Lobsang Tashi excitedly raised his glass and said: "I am ordered by the Dalai Lama to express my gratitude to everyone, and to toast to the enhancement of stronger unity in the future and to Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities in the People's Republic of China!" Immediately, all the secular and religious officials present raised their glasses, and the leading cadres of the troops entering Tibet and the staff entering Tibet all stood up for the toast. Then, General Zhang Jingwu, the representative of the Central People's Government, delivered a reply. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Dalai Lama on behalf of the cadres sent by the Central People's Government to work in Tibet and all the commanders and fighters of the troops entering Tibet. He emphasized that the peaceful liberation of Tibet is the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities in the People's Republic of China, and the great victory of the correct policies of the Central People's Government. Finally, he expressed that all military and government personnel working in Tibet will unite with all the secular and religious people of Tibet, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and the leadership of the Dalai Lama, resolutely implement various policies, especially the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, jointly expel imperialist forces, consolidate national defense, and create happiness for the Tibetan people. The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere full of unity and joy, and everyone constantly cheered in Tibetan and Chinese, "Long live the liberation of the Tibetan nationality!" and "Long live the great unity of all nationalities in the People's Republic of China!"
