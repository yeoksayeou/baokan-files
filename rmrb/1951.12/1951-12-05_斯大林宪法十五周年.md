Editor's Note: December 5th marks the fifteenth anniversary of the Soviet Union's Stalin Constitution Day. The Stalin Constitution is the first truly democratic and socialist constitution in the world. This constitution, in extremely simple terms, illustrates the fact that socialism and the most thorough democracy have been victorious in the Soviet Union. It not only inspires the Soviet people to continue their tireless struggle to realize the beautiful society of communism, but also points out the direction for oppressed people around the world to strive for peace, freedom, and a happy life. Therefore, this constitution is a document of great historical and international significance. To celebrate this great festival, this newspaper specially publishes this article by Soviet comrade Shefu Likefu.

Fifteen years ago, on December 5, 1936, after five months of discussion by the entire people, the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets approved the new Constitution of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people call it by the name of the great creator of the Constitution, calling it the Stalin Constitution.

The new Constitution legally affirmed the world-historical victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, and affirmed the fact that the Soviet Union had entered the completion stage of socialist construction and was gradually transitioning to communism. It consolidated the victory of truly popular, socialist democracy in the Soviet Union, firmly establishing the socialist system and the power of the entire people. All power in the Soviet Union belongs to the working people of town and country, and is exercised through the Soviets of Working People's Deputies.

Before the new Constitution was adopted, the Soviet people, by implementing Stalin's policies of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, had turned the Soviet Union into a powerful industrial-collective farm country. The socialist mode of production has become the firm ruling mode in industry. In agriculture, instead of millions of small individual agricultural economies with their technological backwardness and the dominance of rich peasants, a sound system of collective farms and state farms equipped with modern technology has been established. The rich peasant class has been completely eliminated. Merchants and speculators have been driven out of commerce. All trade has been transferred to the hands of the state, cooperatives, and collective farms.

In this way, the capitalist elements in the Soviet Union have been thoroughly eliminated, and socialism has triumphed in all sectors of the national economy. The exploitation of man by man has been eliminated forever, and socialist ownership of the means of production has been established as the unshakable economic foundation of Soviet society.

The socialist economy has no crises or unemployment, poverty or bankruptcy. The socialist system guarantees the unlimited possibility of the development of productive forces in Soviet society. In 1940, the total volume of Soviet industrial production had almost exceeded the level of 1913 by eleven times; in 1950, Soviet industrial production increased by 73 percent compared with 1940. No capitalist country, past or present, has ever had such a high rate of industrial production growth.

Due to the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the class composition of Soviet society has undergone fundamental changes. All exploiting classes have been completely eliminated. There remain the friendly working class and the peasantry, and the intellectuals. These are new classes that have never existed in past history. The working class, after eliminating the capitalist economic system and laying the foundation for socialist ownership of the means of production, has become a class liberated from exploitation. The state leadership of Soviet society belongs to the working class, as the advanced social class. The Soviet peasants, after joining the collective farms and embarking on the road to socialism, have become new peasants. The new Soviet intellectuals, closely linked with the working class and the peasantry, and loyally serving the people, have emerged. Workers, peasants, and intellectuals cooperate closely and jointly build communism.

The Stalin Constitution is the constitution of socialist democracy. It implements universal, equal, and direct secret suffrage; it guarantees all citizens of the Soviet Union the great rights to work, rest, education, and material security in old age, sickness, and disability; it guarantees women equal rights with men in all aspects of life. The equal rights of Soviet citizens regardless of nationality or race are a most important principle of the Stalin Constitution.

The Stalin Constitution guarantees Soviet citizens true freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly and association. It guarantees the inviolability of the person, home, and privacy of correspondence of all Soviet citizens.

Bourgeois constitutions usually only formally define the rights of citizens, and cannot guarantee the realization of these rights. The Stalin Constitution not only defines the rights of citizens, but also places emphasis on material guarantees, on the means to realize these rights.

The right to work in the Soviet Union is guaranteed by the socialist nature of the national economy and the gradual and steady expansion of the productive forces of Soviet society. Currently, there are approximately 40 million employees in the Soviet Union's national economy. At the end of 1950, the number of employees in the Soviet Union increased by 7.7 million compared with 1940.

The Soviet Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the right to rest. The working day for Soviet employees does not exceed eight hours. For many occupations with difficult working conditions, the working day is reduced to seven hours, six hours, or even four hours. All Soviet employees have annual vacations with full pay. There are many sanatoriums, rest homes, and clubs for the Soviet people to enjoy.

Every Soviet citizen can receive various kinds of education. Universal seven-year free compulsory education is implemented in the Soviet Union. Students in higher education can receive state subsidies. All schools teach in the language of their own nationality.

Now there are more than 200,000 middle and primary schools, 890 universities and specialized schools, and many technical schools in the Soviet Union. In the years after the war, the number of students in middle and primary schools increased by 8 million, reaching 37 million in 1950. In higher education, there were 1,247,000 university students in 1950, compared to only 812,000 in 1940.

The greatness of socialist democracy lies in the fact that it not only guarantees the political rights and various freedoms of Soviet citizens, but also guarantees that they can have a prosperous cultural life. The continuous growth of the material and cultural level of the people's lives is an unchanging law of socialist society. In capitalist countries, more than half of the national income is in the hands of capitalists, while in the Soviet Union, all national income belongs to the working people. In 1950, 74 percent of the national income was used to meet the material and cultural needs of the Soviet working people themselves, and the remaining 26 percent was managed by the state, collective farms, and cooperatives to expand socialist production and other social needs, that is, for the needs of the people's happiness.

The victorious completion of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan has further increased the material and cultural level of the Soviet people, and further consolidated the power of the socialist country. For the benefit of the people, the construction of huge hydroelectric power stations and irrigation systems on the Volga River, the Dnieper River, in Central Asia, and on the Don River to change the natural conditions of vast lands once again demonstrates the truly great, creative power of socialism. These forces are developed because of the unbreakable principles of the Stalin Constitution.

The great victory of socialism was achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin. Therefore, socialist democracy affirms that the Communist Party—the vanguard of the working people—is the leader and guide of Soviet society.

The Soviet system has opened up unlimited possibilities for the creativity of the working people. The people's creativity is brilliantly manifested in the management of the state, in the powerful Stakhanovite movement and the socialist competition of the entire people, in the development of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and in the Soviet people's resolute struggle for peace and friendship among all nations.

On the basis of the commonality of thought and goals of the Soviet people—who are successfully building communism—these powerful driving forces of Soviet society: moral and political unity, the Stalinist friendship of all nationalities, and vibrant Soviet patriotism, have been fully developed.

Under capitalist rule, there is not and cannot be social morality, political unity, and true freedom. For example, in the United States, can we still talk about freedom when the Federal Bureau of Investigation—the US intelligence agency—arrests and imprisons communists and progressive peace fighters? How can there be "equality" when American workers who sell their labor live under the constant threat of unemployment, while countless wealth belongs to a small handful of big capitalists like Morgan, Rockefeller, DuPont, and Harriman? How can we talk about the right to work in capitalist society, where a series of crises and unemployment, hunger and poverty are its conditions of development? In the United States alone, the number of unemployed workers now exceeds 18 million.

Racial discrimination, enslavement, and oppression of weak nations—this is what the hypocritical clauses of bourgeois constitutions regarding freedom and equality conceal. Bourgeois constitutions preserve the power of capitalists, the power to exploit laborers. In the United States, all declarations of democratic rights and freedoms have long been torn up and trampled on by the bosses of Wall Street. Truman, Marshall, and Acheson and their ilk even launched the predatory war in Korea without consulting Congress, although it is stipulated by the constitution that the consent of Congress must be obtained.

The wreckage of bourgeois constitutions is now powerless to conceal the bestial faces of the stranglers of people's freedom—US and British imperialism. Now, it is recklessly and openly preparing to launch a new imperialist war.

Under the banner of the Stalin Constitution, the Soviet people defended the honor, freedom, and independence of the motherland in the days of the war against the Hitlerite bandits. Under this glorious banner, under the leadership of the great Stalin, the Soviet people are successfully striving for the victory of communism, while jointly defending the cause of peace with all progressive mankind.

    斯大林宪法十五周年
    苏联  谢夫里柯夫
    编者按：十二月五日是苏联斯大林宪法节的十五周年纪念日。斯大林宪法是全世界第一部真正民主的、社会主义的宪法。这部宪法用极简明的语句，说明了社会主义和最彻底的民主制在苏联已获得胜利的事实。它不仅鼓舞着苏联人民为实现共产主义的美好社会而继续进行着不懈的斗争，并且向全世界被压迫的人民指出了争取和平、自由与幸福生活的方向。因而这部宪法是一个具有伟大的历史意义与国际意义的文件。为了庆祝这个伟大的节日，本报特发表苏联谢夫里柯夫同志的这篇文章。
    十五年以前，一九三六年十二月五日，在全体人民经过五个月的讨论以后，第八次非常苏维埃代表大会批准了苏联的新宪法。苏联人民以宪法的伟大创造者的名字来称呼它，称它为斯大林宪法。
    新宪法在立法上确定了社会主义在苏联的具有世界历史意义的胜利，确定了苏联进入社会主义建设完成阶段并逐渐向共产主义过渡的事实。它巩固了真正人民的、社会主义的民主主义在苏联的胜利，牢固地确立了社会主义制度和全体人民的政权。苏联的全部政权，属于城乡劳动者，而由劳动者代表苏维埃来实现。
    新宪法通过以前，苏联人民由于实现了斯大林的国家工业化和农业集体化的政策，已使苏联变成一个强有力的工业—集体农场的强国。社会主义的生产方式，已成为工业中的牢固的统治方式。在农业中，代替数百万细小的个体农业经济及其技术落后和富农占优势的情形，奠定了配备有现代技术的集体农场和国营农场的健全的制度。富农阶级已完全被消灭。商人和投机家已被从商业中赶出去。全部贸易已转入国家、合作社和集体农场之手。
    这样，苏联的资本主义成分已被彻底肃清，社会主义已在国民经济的各个部门获得了胜利。人对人的剥削已永远地消除了，而社会主义的生产工具和生产资料所有制，已被确定为苏维埃社会不可动摇的经济基础。
    社会主义经济没有危机和失业、贫穷和破产。社会主义制度保证着苏维埃社会生产力发展的无限可能性。在一九四○年，苏联工业生产的总量已几乎超过一九一三年水平的十一倍；一九五○年，苏联工业品生产较一九四○年增加了百分之七十三。任何一个资本主义国家，过去和现在都不会有这样高的工业生产增长的速度。
    由于社会主义在苏联的胜利，苏维埃社会的阶级组织成分发生了根本的变化。一切剥削阶级被完全肃清。剩下了友好的工人阶级和农民，剩下了知识分子。这些是过去历史上从未有过的新的阶级。工人阶级在消灭了资本主义的经济制度并奠定了社会主义的生产资料所有制之后，已变成由剥削中解放出来的阶级。苏维埃社会的国家领导权，就是属于作为先进的社会阶级的工人阶级。苏维埃农民在加入集体农场走向社会主义的道路后，已经成为新的农民了。和工人阶级与农民密切相连的、忠诚为人民服务的、新的苏维埃知识分子产生了。工人、农民和知识分子密切合作，共同建设着共产主义。
    斯大林宪法，是社会主义的民主主义的宪法。它实行普遍、平等和直接的秘密投票选举权；它保证苏联全体公民有伟大的劳动权、休息权、享受教育权和在年老以及患病和丧失劳动能力时的享受物质保证权；它保证妇女在生活的各方面都与男子享有平等权利。苏联公民不分民族及种族的平等权利，是斯大林宪法一个最重要的原则。
    斯大林宪法保证苏联公民有真正的信仰自由、言论自由、出版自由、集会和结社自由。它保障全体苏联公民的人身、住宅和通信秘密的不可侵犯。
    资产阶级的宪法，通常只限于形式上确定公民的权利，不能保证这些权利的实现。斯大林宪法不仅确定公民的权利，而且把重心放在物质的保证，放在实现这些权利的手段方面。
    苏联的劳动权，因国民经济的社会主义性质和苏维埃社会生产力的逐渐稳步扩大的增长而获得保障。现在，在苏联的国民经济部门中，约有四千万职工。在一九五○年底，苏联职工数目较一九四○年增加了七百七十万人。
    苏联宪法保证着全体苏联公民有休息权。苏联职工的工作日不超过八小时。对于许多工作条件艰难的职业，工作日缩减到七小时、六小时，甚至到四小时。全体苏联职工，每年都有保留原薪的休假。有许许多多的疗养所、休养所和俱乐部供苏联人民享用。
    每一个苏联公民都能受到各种教育。在苏联实行着普及的七年免费义务教育。高等学校的学生可以得到国家的津贴。各学校都用本民族的语言讲授。
    现在苏联有二十余万所中、小学校，八百九十所大学与专科学校，和许多技术学校。战后的几年中，中、小学学生的数目增加了八百万人，而在一九五○年则达到了三千七百万人。在高等学校中，一九五○年有一百二十四万七千名大学生，而一九四○年时仅有八十一万二千名。
    社会主义的民主主义的伟大，在于它不仅保证着苏联公民的政治权利和各种自由，而且还保证他们能有富裕的文化生活。人民生活的物质水平和文化水平的不断增长，是社会主义社会发展的不变法则。在资本主义国家中，国民收入的一半以上都握在资本家手里，在苏联则全部国民收入都属于劳动人民。在一九五○年，国民收入的百分之七十四用来满足苏联劳动者自己的物质和文化的需要，余下的百分之二十六，则交由国家、集体农场和合作社管理，用以扩大社会主义生产和其他的社会需要，也就是作为人民幸福的需要之用。
    战后斯大林五年计划的胜利完成，使苏联人民的物质水平和文化水平获得进一步的增长，使社会主义国家的威力更加巩固起来。为了人民的利益，在伏尔加河、第聂伯河，在中亚细亚和顿河，用以改变广大土地自然状况的巨大水电站和灌溉系统的建筑，再一次地证明着社会主义真正巨大的、创造性的力量。这些力量是因斯大林宪法的牢不可摧的原则而发展起来的。
    社会主义的伟大胜利，是苏联人民在共产党和斯大林同志的领导下获得的。因此，社会主义的民主主义确定共产党——劳动人民的先锋队——为苏联社会的领导者和指导者。
    苏维埃制度为劳动人民创造力开辟了无限发展的可能性。人民的创造力光辉地表现在管理国家方面，表现在强大的斯塔哈诺夫运动和全体人民的社会主义竞赛中，表现在布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的发展，表现在苏联人民争取和平与各民族友好的坚决斗争中。
    在苏联人民——他们正在成功地建设着共产主义——的思想和目标的共同性的基础上，苏联社会的这些强大推动力：道德政治的统一，各族人民的斯大林式的友好和富有生命的苏维埃爱国主义，获得了充分的发展。
    在资本主义统治下，没有同时也不可能有社会的道德，政治的统一和真正的自由。例如在美国，联邦调查局——美国的特务机关——拘捕和监禁共产主义者和进步的争取和平的战士，难道还能谈到自由吗？出卖劳动力的美国工人，生活在经常的失业威胁之中，同时无数财富却属于一小撮像摩根、洛克菲勒、杜邦和哈里曼之流的大资本家，这怎么能是“平等”呢？在资本主义社会中，一连串的危机与失业、饥饿与贫穷就是它的发展条件，难道还能谈到劳动权吗？仅在美国一个国家内，现在失业工人的数目就超过了一千八百万。
    种族的歧视、奴役和压迫弱小民族，这就是资产阶级国家的宪法关于自由和平等的虚伪条文下所掩饰的东西。资产阶级的宪法保存着资本家的政权、对劳动者剥削的政权。在美国，一切关于民主的权利和自由的宣言，早已被华尔街的头子们所撕毁和蹂躏了。杜鲁门、马歇尔和艾奇逊之流，甚至没有征求国会的同意就挑起了朝鲜的掠夺战争，虽然依照宪法规定是一定要征得国会的同意的。
    资产阶级宪法的残骸，现在已无力掩饰人民自由的扼杀者——美英帝国主义的野兽面目。现在，它已不顾一切地公开地在准备发动新的帝国主义战争。
    在斯大林宪法的旗帜下，苏联人民在与希特勒匪帮战争的日子中，保卫了祖国的光荣、自由和独立。在这个光荣的旗帜下，在伟大的斯大林领导之下，苏联人民成功地为共产主义的胜利而奋斗着，同时和全体进步人类共同保卫着和平事业。
