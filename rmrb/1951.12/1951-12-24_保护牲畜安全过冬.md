    Protecting Livestock for Safe Wintering
    Protecting livestock for safe wintering can ensure sufficient animal power for agricultural production next year, which is extremely important for increasing crop yields per unit area. At present, some areas suffering from drought and areas planting industrial raw material crops have felt the shortage of livestock feed. At the same time, in areas implementing land reform this winter and next spring, most of the livestock is still in the hands of landlords, making them vulnerable to landlord sabotage. Therefore, in these areas, special attention should be paid to the issue of protecting livestock over the winter.
    Some areas that suffered from drought this year have already taken concrete measures to protect livestock for safe wintering. For example, the Huna, Chahar, and Xilin Gol Leagues in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have solved the difficulty of insufficient winter grass for livestock by transferring grazing and organizing winter mutual aid groups, and have also organized sideline production, correcting the idea of "relying on eating livestock to survive the famine." These are all very good. However, in areas of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces where the drought is more severe, livestock feed is seriously insufficient. The local leading organs should pay close attention to the supply of feed (such as oil cakes) and the protection of livestock, ensuring that not a single animal starves to death.
    In areas implementing land reform this winter and next spring, leading organs should take effective measures to prevent and stop landlords from harming livestock and failing to properly care for livestock. After farmers have been allocated livestock, attention should be paid to helping farmers solve problems such as livestock feeding and management.
    In most cotton-growing areas, there is a lack of feed for draught animals. Local leading organs and cooperatives must quickly solve this problem; otherwise, they will make a big mistake.

    保护牲畜安全过冬
    保护牲畜安全过冬，可以保证明年的农业生产中有足够的畜力，这对提高农作物单位面积产量，有极大的关系。目前一部分遭受旱灾地区和种植工业原料作物地区，已感到牲畜饲料不足；同时，今冬明春实行土地改革的地区，大部牲畜还掌握在地主手里，容易遭受地主的残害。因此，在这些地区，应该特别注意保护牲畜过冬问题。
    有些今年遭受旱灾的地区，已经采取了具体措施，保护牲畜安全过冬。如内蒙古自治区的呼纳盟、察哈尔盟、锡林郭勒盟，用转移放牧和组织过冬互助组的办法，解决了牲畜冬草不足的困难，并且组织了副业生产，纠正了“靠吃牲畜度荒”的思想。这都是很好的。但是察哈尔、绥远两省旱灾比较严重的地区，牲畜饲料严重不足，当地的领导机关应十分注意饲料（如油饼等）的供应工作和保护牲畜的工作，保证不饿死一头牲畜。
    今冬明春实行土地改革的地区，领导机关应采取有效办法，预防和制止地主残害牲畜和不好好饲养牲畜的现象。在农民分得牲畜后，应注意帮助农民解决对牲畜的饲养管理等问题。
    大部植棉地区，耕畜缺乏饲料。当地领导机关和合作社，必须迅速解决这个问题，否则，就要犯很大的错误。
