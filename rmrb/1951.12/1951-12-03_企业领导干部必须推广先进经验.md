    Enterprise Leading Cadres Must Promote Advanced Experiences
    Party organizations, administrative leading cadres, and trade union organizations in enterprises must pay close attention to promoting advanced experiences. This is a prerequisite for continuously improving production, and also an important symbol of concretely relying on the working class and running people's enterprises well.
    However, many Party organizations, administrative leading cadres, and trade union organizations in enterprises still neglect the promotion of advanced experiences. The case of Guangzhou City's failure to pay attention to promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, which is published in today's newspaper, is a prominent example.
    There are, of course, many reasons for not attaching importance to the promotion of advanced experiences. The Enterprise Party Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions did not dare to promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method because they feared that it would affect the democratic reform movement. However, the basic reason is that many Party organizations, administrative leading cadres, and trade union organizations neglect the creativity of workers; they do not understand that one of the main tasks of enterprise leading cadres is to summarize the advanced experiences created by the broad masses of workers and promote these advanced experiences in a timely manner to educate workers and improve production. In this way, they are bound to be complacent and not only fail to improve the existing production level, but also suppress the enthusiasm and creativity of workers. Some comrades verbally admit to relying on the working class, but since they neglect the advanced production experience of the working class, they are, in essence, not relying on the working class.
    We suggest that all enterprises in the country conduct an in-depth inspection of the situation of promoting advanced experiences and publish the results of the inspection in the newspapers.

### 企业领导干部必须推广先进经验

    企业领导干部必须推广先进经验
    企业中的党组织、行政领导干部以及工会组织，必须十分注意推广先进经验。这是不断提高生产的前提条件，也是具体地依靠工人阶级，办好人民企业的重要标志之一。
    但是，许多企业中的党组织、行政领导干部和工会组织，至今还忽视推广先进经验。本报今天发表的广州市没有注意推广郝建秀工作法，就是一个突出的例子。
    不重视推广先进经验，当然有许多原因。中共广州市委企业党委会和广州市总工会，就是因为害怕推广郝建秀工作法，会影响民主改革运动，而不敢推广郝建秀工作法的。但是，基本的原因，还在于许多党组织、行政领导干部和工会组织，忽视工人的创造性；不懂得企业领导干部的主要任务之一，就是总结广大工人创造的先进经验，及时推广这些先进经验，以教育工人，提高生产。这样，必然是故步自封，不但不能提高现有的生产水平，还会压制工人的积极性和创造性。有些同志口头上承认依靠工人阶级，但是，他们既然忽视工人阶级的先进的生产经验，所以，他们实质上是没有依靠工人阶级。
    我们建议，全国各企业都把推广先进经验的状况，作一次深入的检查，并把检查结果，在报纸上发表。
