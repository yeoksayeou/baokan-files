    Li Yuxiang, a member of the Volunteer Army's cultural troupe, was assigned to the fifth squad of the fifth company to carry out cultural and recreational work on the front lines. Because of his high enthusiasm for work, he quickly became integrated with the soldiers. At this time, the company was engaged in a crash program to build fortifications, and the soldiers were very tired. Li Yuxiang thought, "The more this is the case, the more important cultural entertainment is!" One day, at breakfast, he said to Youth League member Wang Hui, "Little Wang, let's have a challenge digging fortifications today, are you in?" Little Wang said, "Okay! Let the platoon leader divide it up for us, ten steps for you, ten steps for me, let's see who digs deeper and faster!" The challenge was thus decided. After eating, Little Wang picked up a large shovel and went to the front line, digging one shovel after another. Under their influence, everyone became tense. Two hours later, Little Wang had only two or three steps left to complete a trench ten steps long and two feet wide. Li Yuxiang was weak and had little strength, and had only dug half of it. Platoon Leader Lu saw that Li Yuxiang really had no strength, and said, "Old Li, you rest for a while, and I will help you dig." Li Yuxiang then encouraged everyone, "Comrades! Today, my challenge with Little Wang has failed, who has the courage to continue with him!" The soldiers responded to Little Wang one after another, and Little Wang asked the platoon leader, "Add three more steps for me!" In one morning, Little Wang dug a trench thirteen steps long. At lunchtime, Li Yuxiang picked up the loudspeaker and ran to the top of the hill to broadcast to the entire company: "The fifth squad has launched a revolutionary competition in digging fortifications. Comrade Wang Hui and everyone challenged twice, completing a large trench thirteen steps long, two feet wide, and one meter deep in one morning. They will continue to challenge this afternoon. All comrades in the company should learn from them." In the afternoon, the comrades in the fifth squad worked even harder. When they had been working for an hour, Li Yuxiang appeared on the hill again with the loudspeaker. He shouted, "Comrades of the fifth squad, are you tired?" "Not tired!" "Comrades, you are tired, how about I sing a section of Erhuang for you?" "Good!" He opened his voice and sang a newly composed Erhuang. Some soldiers wanted to hear "Tangshan Luozixi Opera", so he sang "Luozixi". After singing "Luozixi", he sang "March of the Democratic Youth" and "Meritorious Service Ballad". This attracted everyone's interest. The soldiers also sang along while digging fortifications, and worked for two hours in the cheerful singing without feeling tired. Seeing that everyone was really tired, Li Yuxiang went down the mountain to boil a few kettles of water for everyone. When the comrades rested and drank the boiled water, he started talking about allegro, praising the fifth company's battle achievements and the glorious history of achieving a model company. The soldiers' morale was very high. They kept their hands and mouths busy all afternoon, and dug more than seventy meters of large trenches. The instructor personally came to the fifth squad and praised them. Li Yuxiang picked up the loudspeaker again and made an introduction to the whole company.
    Li Yuxiang discovered that Wang Hui, who used to be taciturn, was a lively person who could speak well, so he began to train him to do propaganda work. He said to Wang Hui, "Little Wang, after I leave, you should lead the comrades to sing more." Little Wang said, "I don't know how to keep time." Li Yuxiang patiently taught him how to keep time, and also taught him many new songs and ditties. Now, Wang Hui and everyone have made the cultural and recreational activities of the fifth squad lively. (Attached picture)

    志愿军某部文工队员李玉祥，被分配到五连五班去开展阵地上的文化娱乐工作。因为他的工作热情高，很快便和战士们融洽在一起了。这时连队里正在突击修筑工事，战士们都很疲劳。李玉祥想，“越在这种时候，文化娱乐越重要啊！”一天吃早饭的时候，他对青年团员王会说：“小王，今天挖工事，咱俩挑战，你干不干？”小王说：“好！让排长给咱们划开，你十步，我十步，看谁挖得深，挖得快！”挑战就这样说定了。小王吃过饭，拿起大锹上了阵地，一锹紧接一锹地挖。大家在他俩的影响下，也都紧张起来。两个钟头后，小王十步长二尺宽的大壕只剩两三步就完成了。李玉祥身体弱，力气小，才只挖了一半。吕排长看着李玉祥实在没力气了，便说：“老李，你先休息一会，我来帮你挖。”李玉祥接着鼓动大家：“同志们！今天我和小王的挑战失败了，那位有勇气，接着跟他干一下！”战士们纷纷向小王应战，小王要求排长：“再给我加上三步！”一个上午，小王一气把十三步长的壕沟挖成了。午饭时，李玉祥拿起广播筒跑到小山顶，向全连广播：“五班在挖工事中展开革命竞赛，王会同志和大家两次挑战，一上午完成了十三步长，二尺宽，一米深的大壕沟，下午他们还要挑战。全连同志应该学习他们。”下午，五班同志干得更起劲了。当干到一个钟头的时候，李玉祥又拿着广播筒出现在山头上。他喊：“五班同志累不累啊？”“不累！”“同志们是累呀，我给你们唱段二簧好不好？”“好！”他拉开嗓子唱了一段新编的二簧，战士们有愿听“唐山落子戏”的，他唱起“落子”来，唱完落子，他又唱“民主青年进行曲”、“立功小调”，这一来把大家的兴趣引起来了。战士们也一边挖工事，一边随着唱起来，在欢快的歌声中一气干了两个钟头没觉累。李玉祥见大家实在累了，就下山给大家烧了几壶开水，同志们休息喝开水的时候，他又说起快板来，表扬五连的战功和取得模范连队的光荣历史，战士们情绪很高。他们一下午手也没闲嘴也没闲，把七十多公尺的大壕挖成了。指导员亲自来五班，表扬了他们。李玉祥又拿起广播筒向全连作了介绍。
    李玉祥发现过去不爱说话的王会，却是一个能说会讲的活跃分子，就着手培养他作宣传工作。他对王会说：“小王啊，我走了以后，你要多领导同志们唱歌。”小王说：“咱不懂得打拍子。”李玉祥耐心地教他打拍子，还教会了他许多新歌小调。现在，王会和大家把五班的文化娱乐活动搞得活跃起来了。（附图片）
