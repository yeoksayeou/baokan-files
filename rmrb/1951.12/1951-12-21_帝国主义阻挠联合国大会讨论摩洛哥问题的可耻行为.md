　　Imperialism’s Shameful Act of Obstructing UN General Assembly Discussion of Moroccan Issue

　　In this session of the United Nations General Assembly, a new situation has emerged: even using pressure and coercion, American and British imperialism can only obtain a weak "majority" to serve their aggressive policies. The discussion and voting on December 13th at the UN General Assembly regarding the inclusion of the case of Arab countries accusing France of atrocities in Morocco on the agenda not only fully exposed the ugly face of French colonialists and American and British imperialists colluding with each other but also clearly demonstrated that the situation of American, British, and French imperialism in the UN General Assembly is becoming increasingly isolated.

　　The brutal and bloody means adopted by the French colonialists towards the Moroccan people have not only aroused resolute resistance from the Moroccan people but have also aroused the indignation of Arab countries and peace-loving people worldwide. The sympathy of Arab countries for the Moroccan people and their actions to demand that the UN General Assembly discuss the Moroccan issue are completely justified and reasonable, and therefore their proposals have been supported by the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and many other countries.

　　However, French imperialism has tried every possible means to cover up its crimes of massacring the Moroccan people. The notorious French reactionary leader Schuman not only used despicable lies to resist the stern accusations of representatives from various countries but even threatened and obstructed the UN General Assembly from including the proposals of Arab countries on the agenda with the shameless excuse of withdrawing from the United Nations. This shameful behavior of the French government has been fully supported by its American master and its British partner.

　　However, the attempt of American, British, and French imperialism to obstruct the UN General Assembly from discussing the Moroccan issue is only their futile struggle. Although American, British, and French imperialism have reluctantly used their pitiful voting machine to "delay" consideration of the Moroccan issue, the will and strength of the Moroccan people to resist imperialism and demand independence will not be delayed, nor will the growing deep sympathy of the people of Arab countries and all honest people in the world for the Moroccan people be delayed. The shameful actions of imperialism will only make them more isolated.

### 帝国主义阻挠联合国大会讨论摩洛哥问题的可耻行为

　　帝国主义阻挠联合国大会讨论摩洛哥问题的可耻行为
    在这届联合国大会中，出现了一个新的情况：美英帝国主义即使用高压和强迫的手段，也只能得到微弱的“多数”来为它们的侵略政策服务了。十三日联合国大会对阿拉伯国家控诉法国在摩洛哥暴行案列入大会议程问题的讨论和表决情形，不但充分地暴露了法国殖民者和美英帝国主义狼狈为奸的丑恶面目，而且也清楚地说明了美、英、法帝国主义在联合国大会中的处境是愈来愈显得孤立了。
    法国殖民者对摩洛哥人民所采取的残暴血腥手段，不但引起了摩洛哥人民的坚决反抗，同时也激起了阿拉伯各国和全世界爱好和平人民的公愤。阿拉伯各国对于摩洛哥人民的同情和要求联合国大会讨论摩洛哥问题的行动是完全正当合理的，因而它们的提案就受到了苏联、人民民主国家和其他许多国家的支持。
    但是法帝国主义却百般地企图掩饰它的残杀摩洛哥人民的罪行。臭名昭著的法国反动头子舒曼不但用卑鄙的谎言来抵挡各国代表的严词斥责，甚至还以退出联合国的无耻借口来威胁和阻挠联合国大会将阿拉伯各国的提案列入议程。法国政府的这种可耻行为，完全受到了它的美国主子和它的英国伙伴的撑腰。
    但是，美英法帝国主义阻挠联合国大会讨论摩洛哥问题的企图，只是它们的徒然挣扎而已。美英法帝国主义虽然勉强地利用了它们的可怜的表决机器来“延缓”考虑摩洛哥的问题，但是摩洛哥人民反抗帝国主义和要求独立的意志和力量是不会延缓的，阿拉伯各国人民和世界一切正直人们对于摩洛哥人民的深厚同情的增长也是不会延缓的。帝国主义的可耻行动，只会使它们自己更加孤立起来。
