    Reply from the Department of Culture and Education of the Chahar Provincial People's Government Regarding the Allocation of Normal School Graduates
    The situation of our province allocating normal school graduates to other work positions is true. The reason is: at that time, our province lacked cadres and could not resolve the issue. The provincial-level leading authorities decided to transfer a small portion of normal school graduates. The Personnel Department of our Provincial People's Government was responsible for assigning their work. The majority of the remaining normal school graduates were directly assigned to educational work positions by us. However, some normal school graduates, after arriving in various localities, were assigned to other work by the local government agencies. This phenomenon shows that certain agencies only unilaterally emphasized the lack of cadres and neglected the needs of cultural and educational construction. At the same time, it shows that our handling of this issue was not serious enough.

    察哈尔省人民政府文教厅对师范毕业生分配问题的答复
    我省把师范学校毕业生分配到其他工作岗位去的情况是真实的。原因是：当时我省干部缺乏，无法解决，省级领导机关就决定从师范毕业生中抽调一小部分人，由我省人民政府人事厅分配工作；其他大部分师范毕业生，仍由我们直接分配到教育工作岗位。但也有部分师范毕业生到各地后，又被当地政府机关分配担任了其他工作。这种现象说明了某些机关只是片面地强调干部缺乏，而忽视了文化教育建设的需要，同时，说明了我们对这一问题的处理也是不够认真的。
