    Cooperatives Should Not Misappropriate State Funds for Cotton Purchase
    The state's investment in various undertakings is based on an overall plan. All units receiving funds must strictly adhere to state regulations when using the funds and should not misappropriate them at will.
    Some cooperatives in cotton-producing areas have misappropriated cotton purchasing funds when purchasing cotton on behalf of the state. Taking the Shandong cotton-producing area as an example, in Pingyuan, Pingnan, Ningjin, and Nanpi counties alone, there were fourteen cooperatives that misappropriated cotton purchasing funds or sold the seed cotton they purchased on their own. They used more than 36 million yuan of cotton purchasing funds and processed and sold more than 67,000 jin of seed cotton. This phenomenon also occurred in other cotton-producing areas.
    The arbitrary misappropriation of funds by cooperatives, like the arbitrary misappropriation of funds by other departments, is an illegal act. It disrupts the state's plan for the use of funds, wastes state funds, and seriously hinders the normal supply of state-owned trading departments to the cotton textile industry.
    Cooperatives are an important part of the people's economy, and they should become a powerful assistant to the state-owned economy, actively helping state-owned enterprises complete their purchasing and sales tasks and meet the needs of the state and the people. Any thought or behavior that only sees the immediate interests of the cooperative's own department or a few people, and ignores and damages the interests of the state, is illegal and also harms the long-term interests of the members. These thoughts and behaviors should be resolutely corrected.

    合作社不应挪用国家购棉资金
    国家对各种事业的投资，是有通盘计划的。各领款单位必须严格遵照国家规定，使用资金，不应随便挪用。
    部分棉区合作社给国家代购棉花时，发生了挪用购棉资金的现象。以山东棉区来说，仅平原、平南、宁津、南皮四县，就有十四个合作社，挪用购棉资金，或擅自把代购的籽棉加工出售。他们动用的购棉资金有三千六百多万元，加工出售的籽棉有六万七千多斤。这种现象同样发生在其他棉产区。
    合作社随便挪用资金，和其他部门随便挪用资金一样，是一种犯法的行为。它破坏了国家使用资金的计划，浪费了国家的资金，严重地妨碍了国营贸易部门对于棉纺工业的正常供应。
    合作社是人民经济的重要组成部分，它应当成为国营经济的有力助手，积极地帮助国营企业完成购销任务，满足国家和人民的要求。任何只看到合作社本部门或少数人的眼前利益，忽视和破坏国家利益的思想行为，都是犯法的，也是危害社员长远利益的。对于这些思想行为，应当坚决加以纠正。
