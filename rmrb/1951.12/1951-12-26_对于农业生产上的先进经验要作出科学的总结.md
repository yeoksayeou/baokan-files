It is necessary to scientifically summarize advanced agricultural production experiences.

The practical experience of Chinese farmers has proven that the method of close planting for increased production in Soviet agricultural science can be promoted in China. That close planting of cotton can lead to high yields has been proven by Qu Yaoli, a labor model in Shanxi Province. That close planting of rice can increase production has also been proven by Liu Changwen and Zou Yubin, labor models in Hebei Province. Now, one of the important experiences of Shaanxi farmer Shi Anfu in achieving high wheat yields is also close planting. These experiences of high yields coincide with the ideas of close planting in Soviet agricultural science. These facts illustrate that we must attach great importance to the creativity of the working masses and must use scientific methods to summarize the experiences of the masses. The fundamental source of natural science theory is the production experience of the masses. Various superior production experiences must conform to certain scientific principles. One of the important responsibilities of agricultural production leaders is to carefully and scientifically study and summarize the increased production methods of advanced producers, systematize them and elevate them, and raise them to the level of scientific theory; to enable those who created them to more consciously grasp them, and to enable them to be accepted by the majority of farmers more quickly.

    对于农业生产上的先进经验要作出科学的总结
    我国农民的实际经验，已经证明了苏联农业科学上的密植增产的方法，在我国是可以推行的。棉花密植可以丰产，已经由山西省劳动模范曲耀离证明了，水稻密植可以增产，也已经由河北省劳动模范刘长文、邹玉彬等证明了；现在，陕西省农民史安福小麦丰产的重要经验之一也是密植。这些丰产经验和苏联农业科学上的密植思想不谋而合。这些事实说明：我们必须十分重视劳动群众的创造，必须用科学的方法，总结群众的经验。自然科学理论的根本来源就是群众的生产经验。各种优越的生产经验必是合乎一定的科学原理的。农业生产领导者的重要责任之一，就是把先进生产者的增产方法，认真地科学地加以研究和总结，使它们系统化并提高起来，上升为科学理论；使创造它们的人能够更自觉地掌握它们，并使它们能够更快地为多数农民所接受。
