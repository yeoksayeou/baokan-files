Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 13th. Our frontline reporter reported on the 12th on the current situation in Korea, stating:

	Over the past half-month, on the 200-kilometer-long winter front in the Korean Peninsula, the American invading army and its accomplice forces have been frequently conducting small-scale offensives. The American invaders are reducing the scale of military offensives not because the armistice negotiations have reached an agreement on the second agenda item, nor out of pity for the lives of their soldiers, but because their "Autumn Offensive" suffered a severe defeat and American troop morale is low.

	Regarding the current situation, the American invading army's Eighth Army communiqué and American news agency reports often use reports of "no activities in the entire Korea except for minor outpost skirmishes" to conduct purposeful lies and propaganda. In fact, the American invaders have not stopped forcing soldiers eager for a swift armistice into military offensives where they may die at any moment; they are also more frantically bombing peaceful towns and villages in North Korea, brutally slaughtering the elderly, women, and children.

	Just as when the armistice negotiations began in July, the American invaders, while conducting so-called "keeping the pressure on" small-scale offensives, are stepping up the recovery and strengthening of their military forces, which suffered heavy losses in the "Autumn Offensive." The American invaders are also taking advantage of the current opportunity to direct the Syngman Rhee gang to carry out bloody massacres of the people in South Korea, attempting to eliminate the people's guerrillas who are bravely and arduously fighting to resist aggression in one fell swoop. But this bloody action is bound to fail.

	These conspiratorial activities show that the American invaders are not planning to quickly end the Korean War, but are preparing to continue their aggression against Korea. Since the armistice negotiations have discussed the third agenda item, American presidents and generals have once again clamored for so-called "military pressure," vainly attempting to use this "pressure" to force our side to accept their unreasonable suggestions and absurd demands, which once again shamelessly exposes the aggressive face of the United States.

	However, the "military pressure" clamored by the invaders has long gone bankrupt. During the period when the US side tried its best to obstruct the resumption of armistice negotiations, Van Fleet clamored extensively about "military pressure," but the result was that he lifted a rock only to drop it on his own feet—suffering heavy losses of more than 80,000 troops and a large number of combat weapons in the so-called "Autumn Offensive," so that he is currently unable to launch a large-scale offensive.

	Although the current situation is not intense, the commanders and combatants of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are well aware that the American invaders are full of tricks, and they are vigilantly guarding their positions, ready to crush any new offensive the enemy dares to launch.

    新华社前线记者报道目前朝鲜战况
    美军损失惨重士气低落无力大规模进攻
    我军警惕地守卫阵地随时准备迎击敌人
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】本社前线记者十二日报道目前朝鲜战况称：
    最近半个月来，在朝鲜半岛二百多公里长的冬季战线上，美国侵略军和他的帮凶军正频繁地进行着小规模的进攻。美国侵略者缩小军事进攻的规模，不是因为停战谈判取得了第二项议程的协议和怜惜他们士兵的生命，而是由于他的“秋季攻势”遭受了严重的失败和美军士气的低落。
    对于目前的战况，美国侵略军第八军的公报和美国通讯社的消息往往是用“除小的前哨战以外，整个朝鲜没有其他的活动”的报道，来进行含有某种目的的撒谎宣传。事实上，美国侵略者没有一刻停止过强迫渴望迅速停战的士兵投入随时可能死亡的军事进攻；他们并且更疯狂地用飞机轰炸北朝鲜的和平城镇和村庄，惨无人道地屠杀着老人、妇女和儿童。
    像七月间停战谈判开始时一样，美国侵略者一面在进行着所谓“保持紧张状态”的小规模进攻，一面正在加紧恢复和加强他在“秋季攻势”中遭受惨重损失的军事力量。美国侵略者并利用目前的时机，指挥李承晚匪帮对朝鲜南部的人民进行血腥的大屠杀，他们企图一举消灭为反抗侵略而英勇艰苦地斗争着的人民游击队。但这种血腥行动必然是要失败的。
    这些阴谋活动，说明美国侵略者并不是在做迅速停止朝鲜战争的打算，而是在做继续侵略朝鲜的准备。在停战谈判讨论第三项议程以来，美国的总统和将军们又叫嚣起所谓“军事压力”来了，妄图以这个“压力”来迫使我方接受他们无理建议和荒谬要求，这就又一次厚颜无耻地暴露了美国的侵略面目。
    但是，侵略者所叫嚣的“军事压力”是早已破产了。在过去美方极力阻挠恢复停战谈判的期间，范佛里特曾大肆叫嚣过“军事压力”，结果是搬起石头打自己的脚——在所谓“秋季攻势”中遭受了八万多兵员和大量战斗武器的惨重损失，以致目前无力发动大规模的进攻。
    虽然目前的战况并不激烈，但是朝、中人民军队的指挥员和战斗员都深知美国侵略者是诡计多端的，他们正警惕地守卫着自己的阵地，准备粉碎敌人敢于发动的任何新的进攻。
