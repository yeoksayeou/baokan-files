Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. At the meeting of the sub-committee of the Korean armistice talks in Kaesong at 11:00 AM (Korean time) on the 10th, the opposing side's representatives still refused to express their attitude towards our side's proposal on December 3rd to invite neutral countries to establish a supervisory body, claiming that it still needed to be considered by the opposing side's chief representative. This morning, our side's representatives immediately pointed out that since both delegations had entrusted the third agenda item to the sub-committee for resolution, the opposing side's sub-committee representatives should not push this issue back to the chief representative as an excuse to avoid discussing our side's proposals, and continue to delay the progress of the meeting. In order to reach an agreement on the third agenda item as soon as possible, our side's representatives once again demanded that the opposing side withdraw its unreasonable suggestions and demands to interfere in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and threaten our rear, and clearly express its attitude towards our proposals. However, the opposing side still stated that it had no new opinions, and shortly after the meeting began, proposed an adjournment, to reconvene at 11:00 AM on the 11th.

    美方对我建议仍拒不表示态度
    我方要美方收回其无理的建议和要求
    【新华社开城十日电】十日上午十一时（朝鲜时间）开城的朝鲜停战谈判的小组委员会上，对方代表对我方在十二月三日所提出的邀请中立国家成立监察机构的建议，仍然拒绝表示态度，声称仍须由对方首席代表考虑。上午我方代表当即指出：既然双方代表团已将第三项议程交由小组委员会解决，对方小组委员会代表就不应该将这一问题从新推到首席代表身上，以作为避免讨论我方建议的藉口，而继续拖延会议的进展。为了早日达成对于第三项议程的协议，我方代表再度要求对方收回其干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内政与威胁我后方的无理建议和要求，并对我方建议明确表示态度。但对方仍然表示并无任何新的意见，并在会议开始后不久即行提议休会，至十一日上午十一时复会。
