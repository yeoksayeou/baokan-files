Leading cadres at the Jilin Railway Bureau have an insufficient understanding of the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and lack a clear understanding of the importance of relying on the working class, which has slowed down the progress of the bureau's Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

Since the Jilin Railway Bureau launched the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in mid-October, by the end of October, 688 groups (accounting for 27.5% of the total number of groups in the bureau) had formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Some units have already achieved preliminary results. However, overall, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement at the Jilin Railway Bureau has been relatively slow and the results have not been very significant.

**Leading cadres lack a clear understanding of the meaning and direction of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement**

The fundamental reason for the slow progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement at the Jilin Railway Bureau is that the leading cadres do not fully understand the purpose and significance of this movement. When arranging the work of increasing production and practicing economy, the leading cadres did not ideologically mobilize the masses, but simply assigned tasks from top to bottom. Although the enthusiasm of the masses was high, they could not use their energy. The development of the movement is extremely uneven: from the perspective of departments, the tasks of the action departments are clearer than those of the guarantee departments, so the movement is better carried out in the action departments than in the guarantee departments; from the perspective of regions, the movement is better carried out in concentrated areas near the leading organs, where the strength of the cadres is concentrated, than along the lines; from the perspective of mobilizing workers, technicians, and managers, the movement is better carried out among the workers than among the technicians and managers. Some technicians and managers feel distressed during the movement and do not know how they should increase production and practice economy.

Because the leading cadres are not clear about the steps and direction of the movement, some deviations occurred at the beginning of the movement:

**Simply practicing economy, neglecting increasing production**

The increase in railway production is mainly reflected in loading and turnover. Because the units under the Jilin Railway Bureau did not have specific and clear guidelines and tasks for increasing production, the focus of the movement had to shift to economy. Many grassroots cadres lacked understanding of how to practice economy and mistakenly believed that increasing production and practicing economy were contradictory, so in practicing economy, they often neglected production. For example, in order to complete the task of practicing economy, the chief of the Xin Zhan Engineering Section planned to abandon the purchase of 10,000 cubic meters of ballast originally planned to ensure the quality of the line; in order to complete the task of practicing economy, the Meihekou Telegraph Section did not replace the transverse wood that was planned to be replaced this year; some locomotive sections and factories planned to replace the broken copper parts of locomotives with iron ones. Such practices will greatly hinder production and therefore cannot be considered economy.

**Overtime work to increase production**

Many grassroots cadres believe that to increase production, they must increase the labor intensity of workers, and they rarely think about how to increase production by tapping the potential of enterprises. Therefore, the phenomenon of overtime work has emerged. Some locomotive sections and factories have been working until 10 o'clock every night since the beginning of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. This practice is not only insufficient to increase production, but also harms the health of the workers and will seriously affect production.

**The Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement is not well integrated with various tasks**

Some administrative cadres believe that all movements are matters for the Party and the trade union and have little to do with themselves, so they ignore the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement and only inspect winter prevention and conduct examinations of technical management regulations. The Party's grassroots organizations in some units are simply conducting Party consolidation studies. Some cadres oppose the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to the patriotic pact and donation work, believing that increasing production and practicing economy is an extra burden. They said: "The patriotic pact and donation movement is not over yet, and now comes the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement." Some trade union chairmen also said: "Where is the time to engage in increasing production and practicing economy?"

**Neglecting propaganda and education work**

Many cadres did not seize the opportunity to carry out propaganda and education work at the beginning of the patriotic Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. Therefore, the masses do not fully understand the great political significance of this movement in developing the economy, consolidating national defense, and strengthening the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. For example, some workers said: "Our wages are not high, how can we save money?" Some drivers said: "Our cars can save a little coal every month, should we take out the bonus for saving coal?" Some engineers even felt that they could not increase production and practice economy, so they went to pick up stone chips or mend winter boots for the workers.

**Leading cadres' understanding of relying on the working class is not clear**

Another reason for the deviation of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in the Jilin Railway Bureau is that the leading cadres' understanding of relying on the working class is not clear. In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, they did not mobilize the workers to find tricks and tap potential, but used simple methods to order the masses to complete the tasks. There are the following manifestations of not relying on the working class in the movement: First, the task of increasing production and practicing economy is not handed over to the masses for discussion. This situation is relatively common in the units under the Jilin Railway Bureau. After the task of increasing production and practicing economy was assigned to the Tumen Locomotive Section, several leading cadres initially thought that 1.5 billion yuan could be completed, but later the higher authorities gave them the task of 2.7 billion yuan, and they immediately said that "the task is too heavy" and had no confidence in completing it. Later, after the task was discussed by veteran workers and worker representatives, there was 3.1 billion yuan in just a few important savings. Second, tasks are assigned from top to bottom, and allocated at each level. Once the task is arranged, everything is fine. This situation is the most common in the units under the Jilin Railway Bureau. After receiving the task, each station and section assigns it to the workshop. When assigning the task, the cadres neither tell the masses what the task is based on, nor help and mobilize the masses to study what problems need to be solved in completing these tasks. After receiving the task of saving 1.9 billion yuan, the Xi'an Engineering Section assigned it to each work area. After receiving the task, some foremen thought about selling the bent steel rails to complete the task. Third, suppress the creativity and initiative of the masses. Although this manifestation is individual, it is indeed the most serious manifestation of bureaucracy. For example, the station master on duty at Tonghua Station not only did not support the dispatcher's suggestion of opening the train ahead of schedule, but also criticized him for being disorganized and undisciplined; a worker at this station suggested driving from the ninth track to save time. The station master said: "I see you're pretending to be active when I come." This dampened the enthusiasm of the masses in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. These cadres did not realize that to tap the potential of enterprises and create more wealth for the country, it is necessary to rely on the working class.

### 领导干部对增产节约的意义认识模糊  吉林铁路管理局增产节约运动发生偏向

    领导干部对增产节约的意义认识模糊
    吉林铁路管理局增产节约运动发生偏向
    吉林铁路管理局领导干部对增产节约的重大意义认识不足，缺乏明确的依靠工人阶级的思想，使这个局的增产节约运动进展缓慢。
    十月中旬，吉林铁路管理局开展增产节约运动以后，到十月底止，全局已有六百八十八个小组（占全局小组数的百分之二十七点五）制订了增产节约的计划。有些单位的小组已经做出了初步成绩。但是，总的说来，吉林铁路管理局增产节约运动开展速度比较迟缓，效果不很显著。
    领导干部对于增产节约运动的意义、方针认识不明确
    吉林铁路管理局增产节约运动进展迟缓的基本原因，是领导干部对于这个运动的目的和意义认识不够。在布置增产节约工作的时候，领导干部没有从思想上动员群众，只是简单地由上而下摊派任务。群众的热情虽高，但有劲使不上。运动发展极不平衡：从部门来看，行动部门的任务比保证部门的明确，所以运动开展得也比较保证部门好；从地区来看，集中地区因靠近领导机关，干部的力量集中，运动开展得比沿线好；从工人、技术人员、管理人员的发动上来看，运动在工人群众中开展得比在技术人员和管理人员中好，有些技术人员和管理人员在运动中感觉苦闷，不知道自己应该怎样增产节约。
    因为领导干部对运动的步骤和方针认识不明确，所以运动在一开始的时候，就产生了一些偏向：
    单纯节约，忽视增产
    铁路的增产集中表现在装车和周转上。吉林铁路管理局所属各单位因为没有具体明确的增产方针和任务，所以运动的重点，不得不转向了节约。许多基层干部对于如何节约又认识不足，错误地认为增产和节约是对立的，因而在厉行节约当中，往往忽视了生产。如新站工务段段长为了完成节约的任务，原计划中为保证线路质量而购买的一万立方公尺石碴，现在打算不要了；梅河口电务段为了完成节约任务，今年计划要换的横担木也不换了；有的机务段工厂又计划着要把机车坏了的铜零件换成铁的。这样做法，就会大大妨碍生产，因而也就谈不上是节约。
    为了增产，加班加点
    许多基层干部认为要增产就得加强工人劳动强度，没有想到或者很少想到要增产就必须挖掘企业中的潜在力量。因此，出现了加班加点现象。有的机务段工厂自从增产节约运动开始以后，每天晚上都要干到十点来钟。这样做法，不仅不足以增加生产，反而损害了工人的健康，会使生产受到严重的影响。
    没有把增产节约运动和各种工作很好地结合起来
    有的行政干部认为：凡是运动，都是党和工会的事，跟自己关系不大，于是，他们就不管增产节约运动，只是检查防寒，进行技术管理规程的考试。有些单位的党的基层组织单纯地进行整党学习。有的干部把增产节约运动和爱国公约、捐献工作对立起来，认为增产节约是一个额外负担。他们说：
    “爱国公约、捐献运动还没有完，又来了个增产节约运动。”有的工会主席也说：“哪有时间搞增产节约？”
    忽视宣传教育工作
    许多干部在爱国增产节约运动开始的时候，就没有抓紧宣传教育工作。因此，群众对于这个运动在发展经济、巩固国防和增强抗美援朝力量上的重大政治意义认识不够。如有的工友说：“咱们的工资并不高，怎样节约呢？”有的司机说：“咱们的车每月就能省点煤，是不是要把省煤的奖金拿出来呢？”有的工程师甚至觉得自己无法增产节约，就要去检片石或是给工友们补防寒靴子。
    领导干部依靠工人阶级的思想不明确
    吉林铁路管理局增产节约运动发生偏向的另外一个原因是：领导干部依靠工人阶级思想不明确。他们在增产节约运动中，没有发动工人群众去找窍门、挖潜力，而用简单的方法命令群众去完成任务。在运动中就有以下几种不依靠工人阶级的表现：一、不把增产节约任务交给群众讨论。这种情况在吉林铁路管理局所属各单位中是比较普遍的。图们机务段的增产节约任务布置后，几个领导干部最初认为可以完成十五亿元，后来上级给他们的任务是二十七亿元，他们马上提出“任务太重”，没有信心完成。后来，这个任务经老工人和工人代表讨论后，仅几项重要的节约，就有三十一亿元。二、上支下派，按级分摊，布置完了，万事大吉。这种情况在吉林铁路管理局所属各单位中是最普遍的。各站、段在接到任务以后，就分给车间。在分派的时候，干部既不告诉群众这任务是根据什么确定的，也不帮助和发动群众研究在完成这些任务当中要解决那些问题。西安工务段接到十九亿元的节约任务后，就分派给各工区。有的工区接到任务后，工长就想着卖掉弯曲的钢轨来完成任务。三、压制群众的创造性和积极性。这种表现虽是个别的，但确是官僚主义作风的最严重的表现。像通化站值班站长对调度员提出的提前开车的建议，不仅不支持，还批评他无组织、无纪律；这个站有一个工友提议从九道开车，可节省时间。站长说：“你见我来了假积极。”这就给群众在增产节约运动中的热情泼了冷水。这些干部都没有认识到：要发掘企业中的潜在力量，更多地为国家创造财富，就必须依靠工人阶级。
