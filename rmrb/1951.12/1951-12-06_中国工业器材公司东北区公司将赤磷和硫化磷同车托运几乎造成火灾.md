    The Northeast China Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company
    Nearly Caused a Fire by Shipping Red Phosphorus and Phosphorus Sulfide in the Same Vehicle
    To the Editor: The Northeast China Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company shipped a train car of phosphorus sulfide and red phosphorus to Tianjin on October 1st. Due to shaking during the journey, 310 of the containers were damaged. The train arrived in Tianjin on the 2nd. During unloading, a fire suddenly broke out in the car. Fortunately, it was extinguished quickly, and no losses were incurred. According to the unloading workers, the fire was caused by residual phosphorus in the car. In particular, phosphorus sulfide and red phosphorus are more likely to ignite when they come into contact. According to railway regulations, phosphorus sulfide and red phosphorus cannot be transported together. However, the Northeast China Branch, for the sake of transportation convenience, deliberately deceived the Railway Administration by claiming that all of the material was phosphorus sulfide. This is a serious issue concerning the safety of passengers and goods. I hope that all shipping departments and the Railway Administration will pay attention to this issue and handle shipments in accordance with the regulations of the People's Railway to ensure transportation safety.

### 中国工业器材公司东北区公司将赤磷和硫化磷同车托运几乎造成火灾

    中国工业器材公司东北区公司
    将赤磷和硫化磷同车托运几乎造成火灾
    编辑同志：中国工业器材公司东北区公司，于十月一日装运一车皮硫化磷和赤磷至天津。因途中震荡，其中三百一十桶损坏了货桶。火车二日到达天津，卸车时，车内突然起火，幸及时急救，未受损失。据卸车工人说，因车上残磷而引起发火；尤其是硫化磷与赤磷碰在一起，更易起火。按照铁路规定，硫化磷与赤磷装在一起，铁路是不能承运的。东北区公司却为了运输便利，竟故意欺瞒铁路管理局，将硫化磷和赤磷全部说成硫化磷。这是一个有关乘客、货物安全的严重问题。我希望各托运部门与铁路管理局都应注意这个问题，按照人民铁路的规章，办理托运，以保障运输安全。    高起荣
