    The Heroic and Unyielding Struggle of the Egyptian People
    On December 4th and 5th, tens of thousands of residents and students in Cairo, Alexandria, and Suez City, Egypt, held demonstrations to protest the British army's atrocities of killing a large number of Egyptian people on December 3rd and to demand that the British aggressors be driven out of the Suez Canal Zone. Many students angrily shouted during the demonstrations: "We want revenge, give us weapons, let us drive the British into the sea!" The new bloody crimes of British imperialism against the Egyptian people have undoubtedly further heightened and strengthened the Egyptian people's will to resist the imperialist aggressors.
    For more than a month, British imperialism has continuously adopted brutal means of suppression against the Egyptian people, and has even repeatedly carried out blatant bloody massacres. These crimes of British imperialism fully illustrate that when the colonial rule of imperialism is severely hit, and when the people of the oppressed nations rise up to resist imperialist rule, the imperialists will not only not automatically abandon their aggressive interests, but will also try their best to struggle and use all shameless means (including armed suppression) to try to maintain their aggressive position. The tyrannical methods repeatedly imposed by British imperialism on the Egyptian people have very clearly told the Egyptian people and the people of the Middle East a truth: to be liberated from imperialist enslavement and oppression, the only way is to wage a resolute and forceful struggle against imperialism. Without doing so, the oppressed people cannot expel the aggressive forces of imperialism, and cannot obtain national independence and freedom.
    The Egyptian people's unyielding struggle against the British aggressors has proved that the national consciousness of the Egyptian people of all classes has been significantly improved. In order to drive out the foreign aggressors who have occupied their country for seventy years, the Egyptian people have shown extremely strong will and heroic behavior in the struggle. Any repressive measures of British imperialism cannot stop the Egyptian people from moving forward bravely, but instead further make them demand to take up arms to deal with the armed enemy.
    In the struggle against British imperialism, many Egyptian patriots have already bravely sacrificed themselves. But the blood of the Egyptian people will never be shed in vain; every drop of blood of the martyrs will lay a cornerstone for the cause of national liberation and independence of the Egyptian people, and millions of Egyptian people will surely continue to move forward on the bloodstained footsteps of the Egyptian patriotic martyrs.

    埃及人民英勇不屈的斗争
    埃及开罗、亚历山大港和苏彝士城的成千成万居民和学生、在本月四日和五日举行示威游行，抗议英国军队在本月三日枪杀大批埃及人民的暴行，并要求把英国侵略者赶出苏彝士运河区。许多学生在示威时愤怒地高呼：“我们要报仇，给我们武器，让我们把英国人赶下海去！”英帝国主义对埃及人民的新的血腥罪行，无疑地已使埃及人民反抗帝国主义侵略者的斗争意志更加高涨和坚定了。
    一个多月以来，英帝国主义对埃及人民不断地采取了凶暴的镇压手段，甚至屡次肆无忌惮地实行公开的血腥屠杀。英帝国主义这种罪行，充分地说明了：在帝国主义的殖民统治遭受到严重打击的时候，在被压迫民族的人民起来反抗帝国主义统治的时候，帝国主义者不但不会自动放弃它的侵略利益，而且还要竭力进行挣扎，用一切无耻的手段（包括武装镇压）来设法保持它的侵略地位。英帝国主义对于埃及人民所一再施行的横暴手段，十分明白地告诉了埃及人民和中东人民一个真理：要从帝国主义的奴役和压迫下解放出来，就只有对帝国主义进行坚决有力的斗争。不这样做，被压迫的人民就不可能驱逐帝国主义的侵略势力，就不可能得到民族的独立和自由。
    埃及人民反抗英国侵略者的不屈斗争，已经证明了埃及各阶层人民的民族自觉是显著地提高了。为了把侵占他们国土已达七十年之久的外国侵略者赶出去，埃及人民在斗争中表现了极为坚强的意志和英勇的行为。英帝国主义的任何镇压手段并不能阻止埃及人民勇敢前进，反而使他们进一步要求拿起武器来对付武装的敌人了。
    在反对英帝国主义的斗争中，埃及的不少爱国志
    士已经英勇地牺牲了。但是埃及人民的鲜血绝不会白流的；牺牲者的每一滴鲜血，都将为埃及人民的民族解放和独立事业奠下一块基石，千百万的埃及人民必将踏着埃及爱国烈士的血迹继续前进。
