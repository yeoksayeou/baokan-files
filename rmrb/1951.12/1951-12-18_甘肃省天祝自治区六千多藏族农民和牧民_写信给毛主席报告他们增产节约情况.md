Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 14th: More than six thousand Tibetan farmers and herdsmen in the Second Township of Tianzhu Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the 11th, reporting on their efforts to carry out the patriotic production increase and savings campaign. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao: Upon hearing your call, our Tibetan farmers and herdsmen immediately convened a township representative meeting and established a production increase and savings committee. Based on the actual conditions in our township, we formulated specific measures for increasing production and saving.

Our Second Township is a semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral area. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our farmers couldn't afford farm tools and didn't know about fertilization or weeding, so the annual harvest was only 25%. Those who raised livestock lacked good pasture and pens, and the survival rate of young animals was only 40%. Back then, our production situation was "crops like weeds, livestock like bones." Now our situation is different. This year, we plowed all our land twice, weeded it twice, and applied an average of six large carts of manure per mu, increasing the harvest by 100% compared to before liberation. This year, 80% of the livestock in the township have been vaccinated, and the survival rate of young animals has increased to 65%. Next year, we are determined to increase crop yields by another 10%, raise the survival rate of young animals to 75%, and increase our annual income from digging medicinal herbs, hunting, etc., to 60 million yuan. In the three months from now until the Spring Festival, our township plans to save 10 million yuan on expenses such as tobacco and alcohol, and use it all to purchase production tools.

In order to fulfill next year's production increase plan, we must further organize ourselves and improve agricultural production techniques. We now have fifteen mutual aid teams in our township, and we will organize twelve more next year, so that each natural village has at least three mutual aid teams. We are now burning ash and accumulating manure, striving to increase fertilizer by another two carts per mu next year. The methods of raising livestock have also changed. In the past, each family had a flock of sheep, and 1,300 households in the township had 1,300 flocks, requiring 1,300 shepherds. Now we have combined the small flocks into large flocks, with one flock per natural village. This not only saves two-thirds of the labor force but also allows for planned grazing and better protection of the pastureland.

Chairman Mao, under your leadership, we Tibetan people have been freed from the oppression of imperialism and stood up. We hate American imperialism, and we must do everything possible to increase production and save, and fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers. We wish you good health!

Respectfully submitted by all Tibetan farmers and herdsmen of the Second Township, Tianzhu Autonomous Region, Gansu. December 11, 1951.

    甘肃省天祝自治区六千多藏族农民和牧民
    写信给毛主席报告他们增产节约情况
    【新华社兰州十四日电】甘肃省天祝自治区第二乡的六千多藏族农民和牧民，十一日写信给毛主席，报告他们开展爱国增产节约运动的情形。原信如下：
    敬爱的毛主席：我们藏族农民和牧民听到你的号召，马上就召开乡代表会议，成立了增产节约委员会，并根据本乡的实际情况，订出了增产节约的具体办法。
    我们第二乡是个半农半牧的地区。在国民党反动统治时代，我们做庄稼的买不起农具，也不知道上肥和锄草，每年收成只有两成半；养牲口的，既没有好草，也没有圈棚，幼畜的成活率只有百分之四十。那时候，我们的生产情况是“庄稼一把草，牲口几根骨”。现在我们的情况不同了。今年我们种的地都耕过两遍，锄过两遍，每亩平均上了六大车粪，收成比解放前增加了一倍。今年全乡百分之八十的牲口都打了防疫针，幼畜的成活率已提高到百分之六十五。明年，我们决定再把庄稼的收成提高一成，把幼畜的成活率提高到百分之七十五，把全年挖药材、打猎等收入提高到六千万元。从现在到过春节的三个月中，我们全乡计划节约烟酒等费一千万元，全部用来添置生产工具。
    为了完成明年的增产计划，我们要进一步组织起来提高农业生产技术。现在我们全乡有十五个互助组，明年再组织十二个互助组，使每一个自然村至少有三个互助组。现在我们正在烧灰积肥，争取明年每亩再增加两车肥料。养牲口的办法也改变了。过去我们一家一个羊群，全乡一千三百多户就有一千三百多个羊群，需要一千三百多个放羊的人。现在我们把小羊群合成了大羊群，一个自然村一群羊，这样不但节省了三分之二的人力，而且还能有计划地放牧，更好地保养草山。
    毛主席，在你的领导下，我们藏族人民才摆脱了帝国主义的压迫站起来了。我们痛恨美国帝国主义，我们一定要想尽一切办法来增产节约，全力支持中国人民志愿军。敬祝健康！
    甘肃天祝自治区第二乡全体藏族农民牧民敬上　一九五一年十二月十一日
