In the land reform movement, following the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China" promulgated by the Central People's Government, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "Report on Land Reform Issues," and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's call to "Actively Carry Out Women's Work in Land Reform Areas," the policy of mobilizing both male and female peasants together and earnestly guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women has been basically implemented. Women in peasant families have become an important force in the land reform movement.

In the four major administrative regions of East China, Central and South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, women members account for about 30% of the more than 88 million peasant association members who have been organized. In areas where the work is good, it reaches about 50%. Female representatives generally account for 22% of peasant representatives, and some reach 50%. Women also account for 10% to 15% of the members, chairpersons, and vice-chairpersons of peasant associations. Many of these women who have been mobilized have joined rural self-defense forces, cooperating with the militia to monitor and suppress illegal landlords and saboteurs. In the land reform movement, women's own organizations have also expanded. Most areas have established women's representative conferences, and the number of organized women has generally doubled compared to before the land reform, and in some areas, it has increased four or five times. For example, in Guangxi Province, before the land reform, there were only more than 490,000 organized women, which increased to more than 1.3 million after the land reform. In Jinjiang Prefecture, Fujian Province, before the land reform, there were more than 48,000 organized women, which increased to more than 220,000 after the land reform.

In the land reform movement, women's political consciousness has been raised. They have obtained the right to land ownership just like men and have begun to obtain the right to freedom of marriage. According to statistics from twelve counties including seven counties in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, four counties in Xuancheng Prefecture, Southern Anhui, and Rudong County, Northern Jiangsu: 5,931 women have been freed from feudal oppression, including 5,161 who have been liberated from the feudal marriage system, including divorce, contract termination, and widow remarriage. Fourteen percent of women have already married freely.

However, the policy of mobilizing both male and female peasants together and guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women has not been well implemented in some land reform areas. The reason is that some cadres still have feudal ideas of valuing men over women, do not recognize that women are an important force against the feudal system, and have not fully mobilized women to actively participate in the land reform struggle. Therefore, in these areas, women's class consciousness has not been gradually raised, and some women have even been deceived by the landlord class or bad elements to shake the enthusiasm of the peasant struggle or become "air-raid shelters" for maintaining the landlords. These women, of course, cannot talk about striving for their own legitimate rights. In some areas, in mobilizing women to participate in the land reform movement, the legitimate rights of women have not been effectively guaranteed, and the oppression of women by feudal traditional customs has not been appropriately relieved. Therefore, women are not actively participating in land reform. For example, in Xinzhuang Village, Xinzhuang Township, Poliqu District, Cangma County, Shandong Province, in the early stages of land reform, because no attention was paid to guaranteeing women's legitimate rights, even women activists became discouraged in the later stages of land reform. They said: "We women are involved in the struggle against landlords, but we don't get land rights or freedom of marriage. Our families still don't provide clothes (a local bad habit where the husband's family only gives a newly married daughter-in-law a few pounds of cotton, and she has to use this cotton as capital to spin and weave to provide for her, her husband, and her children's clothes). We women are still beaten and abused, so what's the point of having meetings every day?..." Later, the comrades of the land reform work team in the township publicized that women could get the same share of land as men and took various measures to appropriately relieve women of some special feudal oppression, and the women of the whole township actively took action, so that the land reform and various work tasks could be successfully completed.

The above facts powerfully prove that only by correctly implementing the policy of mobilizing both male and female peasants together and guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women can the power of women be fully brought into play. The women's movement is consistent with the peasant movement. Only by mobilizing women can the masses be fully mobilized, and the land reform can be thoroughly completed. At the same time, the completion of the land reform also opens up a broad path for women to obtain complete equality with men in politics, economy, culture, education, and all social life.

How can we implement the policy of mobilizing both male and female peasants together and earnestly guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women?

First, women in the old society were in a position of dual slavery (they were slaves of both the feudal ruling class and the family), with no rights at all. In the land reform movement, not only must they be given the same opportunities as men to participate in land reform, but also, as Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his "Report on Land Reform Issues": we must earnestly "guarantee the interests that women should get in land reform and the rights that women should have in society." This is an important key to realizing the mobilization of both male and female peasants. Therefore, it is necessary to put forward specific slogans and specific requirements for mobilizing both men and women together and guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women according to the central tasks of each stage of land reform and the consciousness of the masses. For example, in the land reform areas of Hunan, slogans such as "Men and women work together to dig up the roots, and don't let landlords exploit people"; "Men and women jointly classify classes, and don't allow a single landlord to slip away"; "Men and women are of one heart, and they can turn over a new leaf after dividing the land"; "Consolidate township power, and men and women peasants jointly manage"; "Men and women produce together, and strive for equal rights" were put forward as the land reform progressed. These slogans have all become the action convention of the masses at that time.

The acquisition of women's legitimate rights is also gradually realized with the progress of the land reform movement. Land ownership is the most basic right of peasants. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly guarantee that women are given the same share of land as men. When classifying classes, the labor force of women (including housework) should be reasonably calculated, and the past concept that women's participation in labor does not count as labor force should be changed. Women should also be involved in the distribution of land and the issuance of land certificates, and women's opinions should be respected. Various feudal constraints that hinder women from participating in land reform and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, production, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and democratic nation-building, especially the restrictions and abuses of women caused by the feudal marriage system, should be based on the "Instructions on Checking the Implementation of the Marriage Law" of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and effective handling should be carried out by combining ideological education with legal sanctions and handling different situations separately. Problems such as the oppression and enslavement of peasant women by the landlord class (such as landlords forcibly occupying peasant women as maids and concubines) should be resolutely fought against to help peasant women gain liberation. Experience has proved that timely and appropriate resolution of these problems will greatly enhance the enthusiasm of women in participating in land reform and other work.

Second, the feudal ruling class's idea of valuing men over women for thousands of years has deeply penetrated the people. Mobilizing women and guaranteeing various legitimate rights of women will inevitably encounter resistance from the feudal ideas of some peasants and some cadres. Therefore, carrying out extensive and in-depth ideological education against feudalism among the masses is an important prerequisite for mobilizing women. When carrying out general class education and policy education, attention should be paid to attributing the feudal ideas that bind women to the root of class oppression in feudal society, so that women can recognize the crimes of the feudal social system, stimulate their high class hatred, and gradually eliminate the ideas of valuing men over women among the general masses, as well as women's own ideas of inferiority and dependence. When carrying out ideological education, we should also proceed from the overall interests and long-term interests of male and female peasants, based on the spirit of family democracy and harmony, unity and production, advocate respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law, equality between men and women, oppose the feudal patriarchy that destroys women's human rights and property rights, thereby consolidating the unity of peasants, concentrating the fighting spirit of male and female peasants, and eliminating the feudal exploitation system. Therefore, in land reform, not only should we not ignore women's legitimate rights, but we must also care about their personal suffering, combine land reform, carry out publicity on the Marriage Law, and support their struggle against feudal oppression. However, attention should be paid not to exceed the level of consciousness of the masses, not to leave the central work, and not to promote the Marriage Law and deal with marriage disputes in isolation and prominently. Otherwise, it will deviate from the masses, disperse peasant unity, be taken advantage of by bad elements, and cause losses in work.

Third, when organizing peasant teams, attention should be paid to organizing women's teams, so that women become an organized force in the peasant team. This is an important step in implementing the policy of mobilizing both male and female peasants together and earnestly guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women. When organizing peasant associations, we must earnestly pay attention to absorbing women from peasant families to participate, cultivate and promote activists among women to participate in leadership work. Under the leadership of the peasant association committee, women's representative conferences should be organized in a timely manner so that, according to the special circumstances of women, the broad masses of women can be united and educated, so that the tasks of the peasant association can be closely combined with the actual situation of women, mobilizing women to complete the central work of the peasant association and at the same time striving for their own legitimate rights. Using women's representative conferences can discover, cultivate, and promote more women activists and women cadres, and through them, mobilize women more widely and deeply, strengthen the peasant team, and strengthen the peasant's momentum.

According to the experience of some areas: women's representative conferences should be held temporarily to formally establish them according to the progress of land reform and the level of consciousness of the women's masses; the main participants should gradually expand from female representatives of the peasant association to include female representatives of all democratic classes in rural areas and small towns; the leadership should transition from female members of the peasant association to the election of representative committees; so as to gradually become a fixed and main organizational form for leading rural women's work. In the land reform experiment in Shandong Province, Lengshuigou Township, Licheng County, created the experience of convening women's representative conferences of each class separately during land reform to implement the policy of mobilizing both male and female peasants together and guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women. This experience was promoted to more than 3,000 townships in the province, and women's representative conferences were established in land reform.

Fourth, in order to correctly implement the policy of mobilizing both men and women together and earnestly guaranteeing the legitimate rights of women, the Communist Party committees, land reform committees, peasant association committees, and democratic women's federations at all levels in the land reform areas should educate cadres to deeply understand that the cause of women's liberation is an important revolutionary cause, and women's work is a part of the entire land reform work, which must be unified in arrangement, inspection, and summary from beginning to end with each process of the movement. When leading cadres create and promote general experience in key areas under their personal control, they should also create and promote women's work experience, so that general work and women's work can be "combined with points and surfaces" and completely consistent. Model male and female women workers should be commended, and various erroneous ideas and practices regarding women and women's work should be criticized. For example, in the land reform in Shaanxi Province, there were very few female cadres participating in land reform (accounting for only 5.7% of all cadres participating in land reform), but because the leading organs attached importance to mobilizing women, in most areas, relying on male cadres, women's work was carried out; many Communist Party county party secretaries, district party secretaries, and branch secretaries personally led women's work, and many male cadres became model women workers. This is the correct approach. The Democratic Women's Federation is the organization of the women's masses themselves and is an institution for promoting women's work. It should more actively take the mobilization of women to participate in land reform and the protection of women's legitimate rights as the central task at that time, and put forward opinions and requirements for women's work to the local land reform leading organs in a timely and appropriate manner. The Land Reform Committee and the Peasant Association Committee should value and support the correct opinions and requirements of the Democratic Women's Federation, allow them to participate in the leadership work of land reform and related meetings, and give them the necessary conditions for their work. And it is hoped that the Communist Party committees in various places will strengthen their leadership over the Democratic Women's Federation. In the various important stages of land reform, not only should general work reports, discussions, and summaries in various places include women's work, but they should also assist the Democratic Women's Federation, using the gaps, to convene special women's work meetings to summarize experience in a more detailed and in-depth way, in order to propose methods to promote women's work.

Comrade Stalin taught us: "In the history of mankind, there has never been a great movement of oppressed masses that has succeeded without the participation of working women." (Stalin's Selected Works, Volume 7, Russian edition, page 48, "On Working Women," see "New Chinese Women" Issue 1) Land reform is a great mass movement against the feudal land exploitation system. Women in peasant families are a powerful force against the feudal system. Only by mobilizing them, liberating them, and allowing them to participate in a series of struggles in the land reform movement with their heads held high and their chests out as masters of their own destiny can the great historical task of land reform be thoroughly completed, and can the power of the entire people be further strengthened, so that the entire people can bravely advance for the development of production and the construction of a new China!

    在土地改革运动中，必须贯彻男女农民一齐发动、切实保障妇女合法权利的方针
    柳勉之
    一年来，在进行土地改革的地区，遵照中央人民政府公布的“中华人民共和国土地改革法”、刘少奇副主席“关于土地改革问题的报告”，和中华全国民主妇女联合会“关于积极开展实行土地改革地区的妇女工作”的号召，基本上贯彻了男女农民一齐发动，切实保障妇女合法权利的方针。农民家庭中的妇女已经成为土地改革运动中一支重要的力量。
    华东、中南、西南、西北四大行政区，业已组织起来的八千八百余万农民协会会员中，女会员约占百分之三十左右。工作好的地区则达百分之五十左右。农民代表中，女代表一般占百分之二十二，有的达到百分之五十。农民协会委员、主席、副主席中，也有百分之十到百分之十五是妇女。这些业已发动起来的妇女，有许多参加了农村自卫队，配合民兵监视与镇压不法的地主和破坏分子。在土地改革运动中，妇女本身的组织也扩大了。大部分地区建立了妇女代表会议，有组织的妇女一般比土地改革前增加了一倍，有的地区则增加了四、五倍。如广西省土地改革前，有组织的妇女只有四十九万多人，土地改革后增至一百三十多万人。福建省晋江专区，土地改革前有组织的妇女四万八千多人，土地改革后增至二十二万多人。
    在土地改革运动中，妇女的政治觉悟提高了。她们与男子同样获得了土地所有权，并开始获得了婚姻自由权。据浙江省嘉兴专区七个县、皖南宣城专区四个县、苏北如东县等十二个县的统计：有五千九百三十一个妇女解除了封建压迫，其中从封建婚姻制度下获得解放的有五千一百六十一人，包括离婚、解约、寡妇改嫁等。有百分之十四的妇女已经自由结婚。
    但是，男女农民一齐发动，保障妇女合法权利的方针，在某些土地改革地区，还没有很好地贯彻执行。其原因是某些干部还有重男轻女的封建思想，不认识妇女是反对封建制度的重要力量，没有充分发动妇女积极参加土地改革斗争。因此，在这些地区，妇女们的阶级觉悟未能逐步提高，有些妇女甚至受了地主阶级或坏分子的蒙蔽，去动摇农民斗争的积极性，或者成为维护地主的“防空洞”。这些妇女，当然谈不到争取自身合法权利的了。有些地区，在发动妇女参加土地改革运动中，未能切实保障妇女合法权利，妇女所受封建传统习俗的压迫，没有适当解除，因此，妇女们就不积极参加土地改革。如山东省藏马县坡里区辛庄乡辛庄村，在土地改革初期，因为没有注意保障妇女合法权利，到土地改革后期，连妇女积极分子也情绪低落了。她们说：“斗争地主有我们妇女，土地权、婚姻自由权我们却得不到，家里还是不管穿（当地陋习，婆家只给新娶进门的媳妇几斤棉花，由她用这几斤棉花为本钱，纺织生产，负担她本人、丈夫和孩子的衣服），我们妇女一样挨打受气，还天天开会作什么？……”后来土地改革工作组的同志在该乡宣传了妇女可获得和男子同样一份土地，并采取各种办法，适当地解除了妇女一些特殊封建压迫，全乡妇女便积极行动起来，使土地改革和各项工作任务得以顺利完成。
    以上的事实，有力地证明了只有正确执行男女农民一齐发动，保障妇女合法权利的方针，才能充分发挥妇女的力量。妇女运动与农民运动是一致的，只有发动了妇女，群众才能充分发动起来，土地改革才能彻底完成；同时土地改革的完成，也替妇女开辟了在政治上、经济上、文化教育上及一切社会生活上，获得与男子完全平等的宽阔道路。
    如何才能贯彻男女农民一齐发动，切实保障妇女合法权利的方针呢？
    第一，妇女在旧社会里是处在双重奴隶的地位（既是封建统治阶级的奴隶，又是家庭的奴隶），毫无权利可言；在土地改革运动中，不仅要给予她们和男子同样参加土地改革的机会，还必须遵照刘少奇副主席在“关于土地改革问题的报告”中所指出的：切实“保障妇女在土地改革中应得的利益和妇女在社会上应有的权利。”这是实现男女农民一齐发动的重要关键。因此，必须根据土地改革每一阶段的中心任务和群众的觉悟，提出男女一齐发动，保障妇女合法权利的具体口号和具体要求。如湖南土地改革地区，曾随着土地改革的进程，提出：“男女一齐挖苦根，不让地主剥削人”；“男女共同划阶级，不准一个地主溜出去”；“男女一条心，分了田地好翻身”；“巩固乡政权，男女农民共同管”；“男女齐生产，争取平等权”等口号。这些口号，都变成了群众当时的行动公约。
    妇女合法权利的获得，也是随着土地改革运动的进程逐步实现的。土地所有权为农民最基本的权利，因此，必须切实保障妇女分得与男子同样一份的土地。在划阶级时，应合理计算妇女劳动力（包括家务劳动），改变过去认为妇女参加劳动不算劳动力的观念。分配土地、颁发土地证时，亦应吸收妇女参加，尊重妇女的意见。对于阻碍妇女参加土地改革及抗美援朝、生产、镇压反革命、民主建政等活动的各种封建束缚，特别是对于封建婚姻制度所造成的限制和虐待妇女等现象，应根据中央人民政府政务院“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”，采取思想教育与依法制裁相结合的方针，分别不同情况，作有效的处理。属于地主阶级压迫、奴役农民妇女的问题（如地主强占民女为丫头、侍妾等），则应坚决斗争，帮助农民妇女获得解放。经验证明：及时地并且适当地解决这些问题，就会大大提高妇女群众参加土地改革及其他各项工作的积极性。
    第二，数千年来封建统治阶级的重男轻女的思想，深深地浸入了人民内部。要发动妇女并保障妇女各种合法权利，必然会遇到一部分农民和一部分干部的封建思想的抵抗。因此，在群众中广泛深入地进行反对封建的思想教育，是发动妇女的重要前提。在进行一般的阶级教育、政策教育时，应注意将束缚妇女的封建思想，归结到封建社会阶级压迫的根源上去，使妇女们认识到封建社会制度的罪恶，激发她们高度的阶级仇恨，逐渐肃清一般群众中重男轻女的思想，和妇女本身的自卑、依赖等思想。在进行思想教育时，还应从男女农民的整体利益、长远利益出发，本着家庭民主和睦，团结生产的精神，提倡尊婆爱媳、男女平等，反对摧残妇女人权、财权的封建家长制，从而巩固农民内部团结，集中男女农民的斗志，消灭封建剥削制度。因此，在土地改革中不仅不应该漠视妇女合法权利，而且必须关心她们的切身痛苦，结合土地改革，进行婚姻法的宣传，支援她们反封建压迫的斗争。但应注意不要超过群众的觉悟水平，不要离开中心工作，孤立地、突出地去宣传婚姻法，处理婚姻纠纷。否则就会脱离群众，分散农民团结，为坏分子所乘，造成工作上的损失。
    第三，在组织农民队伍时，应该注意组织妇女的队伍，使妇女成为农民队伍中一支有组织的力量；这是贯彻男女农民一齐发动，切实保障妇女合法权利的方针的重要步骤。组织农民协会时，必须切实注意吸收农民家庭中的妇女参加，培养和提拔妇女中的积极分子，参加领导工作。在农民协会委员会的领导下，应适时地组织妇女代表会议，以便根据妇女的特殊情况，团结与教育广大的妇女群众，使农民协会的各项任务和妇女实际情况密切结合起来，发动妇女完成农民协会的中心工作，同时争取自身的合法权利。运用妇女代表会议，可以发现、培养、提拔更多的妇女积极分子和妇女干部，通过她们，更普遍更深入地发动妇女，增强农民的队伍，壮大农民的声势。
    根据有些地区的经验：妇女代表会议应根据土地改革的进程，妇女群众的觉悟程度，由临时召开到正式建立；由农民协会女代表为主逐渐扩大到包括农村及小集镇的各民主阶级的妇女代表；由农民协会女委员领导到选举代表委员会；以便逐渐成为领导农村妇女工作的固定的、主要的组织形式。山东省土地改革试验中，曾在历城县冷水沟乡创造了土地改革中每一阶级分别召开妇女代表会议，以贯彻男女农民一齐发动，保障妇女合法权利的方针的经验，这个经验，推广到全省三千余乡，都在土地改革中建立了妇女代表会议。
    第四，为了正确地贯彻男女一齐发动和切实保障妇女合法权利的方针，在土地改革地区的共产党各级党委、土地改革委员会、农民协会委员会、民主妇女联合会，应教育干部，深刻认识妇女解放事业是一件重要的革命事业，妇女工作是整个土地改革工作的一部分，必须自始至终，随着运动的每一进程，统一布置、检查、总结。领导干部在亲自掌握的重点地区创造与推广一般经验时，应同时创造与推广妇女工作经验，使一般工作和妇女工作均能“点面结合”，完全一致。应表扬男女模范妇女工作者，批判各种对于妇女和妇女工作的错误思想和作法。如陕西省土地改革中，参加土地改革的女干部很少（只占参加土地改革的全体干部的百分之五点七），但由于领导机关重视发动妇女，在大部分地区，依靠男干部，开展了妇女工作；许多共产党县委书记、区委书记、支部书记亲自领导妇女工作，不少男干部成了模范的妇女工作者。这是正确的作法。民主妇女联合会是妇女群众自身的组织、是推进妇女工作的机构，更应主动地把发动妇女参加土地改革、保障妇女合法权利作为当时的中心任务，及时地、恰当地向当地土地改革领导机关提出妇女工作的意见和要求。土地改革委员会、农民协会委员会应重视与支持民主妇女联合会正确的意见和要求，让她们参加土地改革的领导工作和有关的会议，给予她们工作上应有的便利条件。并且希望各地的共产党党委加强对于民主妇女联合会的领导。在土地改革的各个重要阶段，不但各地的一般工作汇报、讨论和总结中应包含妇女工作，还应协助民主妇女联合会，利用空隙，召开专门妇女工作会议，比较细致深入地总结经验，以便提出办法，推进妇女工作。
    斯大林同志教导我们：“在人类历史上，没有任何一次被压迫群众的伟大运动，没有劳动妇女底参加竟而获得成功的。”（斯大林选集第七集俄文版四十八页“论劳动妇女”，见“新中国妇女”第一期）土地改革是反对封建土地剥削制度的伟大的群众运动，农民家庭中的妇女是一支反对封建制度的强大的力量，只有将她们发动起来，解放出来，使她们昂头挺胸地以主人翁的姿态参加土地改革运动中的一系列的斗争，才能彻底地完成土地改革的伟大的历史任务，才能更加壮大全体人民的力量，使全体人民为发展生产，为建设新中国而奋勇前进！
