    US Military's Brutal Atrocities Against Prisoners of War
    By Kim Sung-tae, Korean People's Army Soldier

    I was captured by the American devils in May of this year while defending a high ground in the Hengcheng area of the eastern front with my comrades. On that day, in order to salvage their defeat of the previous day, the American beasts gathered two battalions, and under the cover of five tanks and seven aircraft, launched a frenzied attack. My comrades and I shouted "Hurrah!" and engaged the frantically charging enemy in hand-to-hand combat. Suddenly, a grenade exploded at my feet, and I immediately fainted. When I woke up, I felt pain all over my body and saw that the American devils were kicking me. I was bleeding heavily, and shrapnel from the grenade was embedded in my left arm and shoulder.
    I looked around and saw eight other wounded People's Army soldiers lying on the ground. When the American devils saw me move, they roared like beasts and kicked my face viciously. Two of my teeth were broken, and blood flowed from my mouth. But three or four American devils continued to beat and kick me with clubs, shouting, "Die! Die!" The other captured comrades also suffered the same fate as me. Later, the devils grabbed the necks of me and the other eight seriously wounded comrades, forced us to stand up, and drove us forward with blows from their rifle butts.
    Among us were two comrades who were unable to walk because of leg injuries. At this point, the devils dragged them by their clothes. After dragging them a few steps, they shot them with pistols. These beasts' atrocities were unbearable to witness. One of our comrades could not contain his anger and cursed, "You bunch of dogs!" The American beasts immediately glared at him, punched him hard in the mouth, knocking out his front teeth. But that wasn't enough; they pulled out their bayonets and stabbed him in the mouth, cutting off his tongue, then shot him twice in the mouth, killing him as well. The American executioners sneered and continued to drive us forward; if we couldn't walk, they either pushed us hard from behind or poked us with their bayonets. We walked for more than thirty li and arrived at the devils' "headquarters." Because of the pain of our wounds and the devils' beatings, we were all on the verge of death.
    Two of our comrades died that night. Another comrade and I were imprisoned in a dark and damp basement. The devils didn't even give us a sip of water, but tortured us in every brutal way possible. The devils stabbed my wounds with knives and whipped us severely with leather whips.
    One day, I was dragged out of the basement. A fellow, who seemed to be an enemy officer, drew a "○" on my chest. I and a dozen other civilians were loaded onto a truck; the truck drove onto the highway and sped south. I felt that they were either going to use us for experiments with bacteriological weapons or for dissection. I had to find an opportunity to escape. When the truck drove onto a bridge by a mountain, I mustered my last strength, pushed away the guard, and jumped into the river. The panicked American devils fired into the river, but didn't hit me. I floated down the rapid current for more than five li before I got ashore and hid in the mountains. I dug up grass roots in the mountains to fill my hunger. Three days later, I was finally rescued by a reconnaissance team of the People's Army.
    In the face of the American imperialists' barbaric and massive slaughter of prisoners, I feel nothing but bitter hatred. I will fight even more bravely to eliminate more American beasts.

    美军残杀俘虏的野兽行为
    朝鲜人民军战士　金成太
    我被美国鬼子俘掳是在今年五月间，当时我正和同志们守卫东部战线横城地区的某高地。这天，美国野兽为了挽救前天的失败，结集了两大队的兵力，在五辆坦克车和七架飞机的掩护下，疯狂进攻。我和同志们高呼“万岁”，向疯狂扑来的敌人进行肉搏，突然间，手榴弹在我的脚下爆炸了，我立即昏倒了。当我醒来的时候，我感到浑身疼痛，睁开眼睛一看：知道美国鬼子正用脚踢我。我流血很多，手榴弹的碎片嵌进了我的左臂和肩膀里。
    我环视周围，看到八名和我同样受着重伤的人民军战士都躺在地上。美国鬼子看到我的身子转动起来，就像野兽般的吼了一声，狠命踢我的面孔。我的两个牙齿被折断，血从嘴巴里流出来。但三、四名美国鬼子继续用棍子打，用脚踢，并且叫道：“你死呀！死呀！”其他被捕的同志，也遭到和我同样的命运。后来鬼子们抓住我和其他八名重伤同志的头颈，硬使我们站起来，用枪托猛打，赶我们向前走。
    我们中间有腿上受伤的两个同志，无论如何也走不动了。这时，鬼子们就拖他们的衣服，拖了几步，就用手枪把他们射杀了。这些野兽的暴行，令人目不忍睹。我们中间有一位同志遏不住激愤，怒骂道：“这群狗子们！”美国野兽们立刻怒目而视，用拳猛击他的嘴巴，打掉了他前面的牙齿。但这还不算，又拔出刺刀，刺入他的口中，切断了他的舌头，随后向他口中开了两枪，也把他打死了。美国刽子手们冷笑了一声，仍旧赶着我们往前走；如果我们走不动，不是在后面猛推，就是用刺刀戳。我们走了三十多里，到达了鬼子的“本部”。因为创伤的疼痛和鬼子们的殴打，我们都已经奄奄一息了。
    我们中间有两个同志，在这天晚上死去了。我和另一个同志被监禁在一处黑暗而潮湿的地下室里。鬼子们连水也不给我们一口，只是用种种暴虐的方法来拷问我们。鬼子们用刀刺我的伤口，用皮鞭狠狠地打我们。
    有一天，我被牵出了地下室。有一个家伙，似乎是敌军军官，在我胸上画上一个“○”。我和其他十几个平民就被装上一辆卡车；卡车开上公路，向南方疾驰。我感觉到，这不是把我们去供细菌武器的实验，就是去供解剖了。我无论如何要找一个机会脱逃。当卡车开到山边一座桥上时，我拿出最后的力量，推开监视兵，跃入河中。惊惶的美国鬼子向河中射击，但没有打中我。我随着急流，流下五里多地，方才上岸，躲入山里。我在山里掘取草根充饥，三天以后，终于被人民军的侦察组救了回来。
    对于美帝国主义这样野蛮地大批屠杀俘虏的滔天罪行，我除了切齿痛恨外，一定要更勇敢的作战，消灭更多的美国野兽。
