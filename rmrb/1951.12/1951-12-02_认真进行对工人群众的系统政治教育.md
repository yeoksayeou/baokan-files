    Conscientiously Conduct Systematic Political Education for the Working Masses

    The East China Administrative Area recently convened a working conference on the political education of workers, deciding to universally conduct a systematic political education on communism and the Communist Party for over one million industrial workers in the region during 1952 and 1953, while continuing to pay attention to making current affairs political study a regular occurrence among employees. Other regions will also convene such meetings in the near future to formulate similar work plans. Conducting communist education among the working masses is a major event, fundamentally raising the class consciousness of the working masses, strengthening the flesh-and-blood relationship between the state and the working masses, and fully leveraging the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses in production.

    In order to conscientiously carry out communist education among the working masses, it is necessary to oppose the blind complacency in the work of political education of workers. Undoubtedly, our work in current affairs political education among the working masses has been successful. Many places, after liberation, conducted political studies on the history of social development, democratic reforms, etc., and our labor movement over the past two years has achieved certain results on this basis. However, simply because of this, some of our comrades believe that political education has been carried out almost completely among the working masses; some comrades see many enthusiastic scenes in their work, and thus, without analysis, believe that the political awareness of the working masses is already beyond question. Therefore, they adopt an attitude of indifference to the ideological situation of the working masses, and become complacent about their daily current affairs propaganda and central task propaganda, thinking that these can solve the problems that occur in the work, and that there is no need to carry out any formal political study. Regularly conducting current affairs propaganda and central task propaganda for the working masses is indispensable, and should be continued in the future. Just like today's propaganda for increasing production and practicing economy, it will enrich the content of political education. However, current affairs propaganda and central task propaganda alone cannot meet the demands of the working masses.

    In order to conscientiously carry out communist education among the working masses, it is necessary to oppose the erroneous idea of opposing political education to cultural education and technical education. Some people say: "Workers cannot understand communist theory," "Without a certain level of culture, one cannot learn communist theory." Therefore, some factory's spare-time schools do not have political classes at all. Undoubtedly, cultural learning and technical learning are the urgent demands of the broad masses of workers, and it is wrong to ignore the workers' urgent cultural demands. However, it is very wrong to conduct cultural learning and technical learning in isolation from political learning, and the two must be closely integrated, and systematic political education must be carried out at the same time. The experience of many places that have already begun to systematically conduct communist education proves that the working masses can not only learn communist theory, but also learn it very well. Many workers, after receiving communist education, have greatly encouraged their interest in learning culture, which is completely understandable. In order to conscientiously carry out communist education among the working masses, it is necessary to oppose the erroneous idea of attempting to abolish political education among the working masses. Some leading personnel in enterprise departments say: "I have not conducted systematic political education, and my production is also doing well." These comrades are satisfied that the immediate tasks can be completed smoothly, but they have not thought about how to fundamentally improve the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, and they turn a blind eye to the working masses' enthusiastic demands for political learning. The reason for this ideological problem is that they have not wholeheartedly relied on the working class, and they do not understand that politically inspiring the production enthusiasm of the working masses is an important responsibility of enterprise leading cadres. They feel that their work has been done almost completely, and therefore express indifference to the work of carrying out communist education among the working masses. This deviation should be resolutely corrected.

### 认真进行对工人群众的系统政治教育

    认真进行对工人群众的系统政治教育
    华东大行政区最近已召开工人政治教育工作会议，决定在一九五二、一九五三两年内对全区一百多万产业工人普遍进行一次系统的关于共产主义和共产党的政治教育，同时继续注意使职工中的时事政治学习经常化。其他地区也将在最近召开这样的会议，制定类似的工作计划。在工人群众中进行共产主义的教育，这是一件大事，是从根本上提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，加强国家和工人群众血肉关系，充分发挥工人群众在生产上积极性和创造性的一项严肃的政治工作。
    为了能够认真地在工人群众中进行共产主义的教育，必须反对在工人政治教育工作上的盲目自满情绪。毫无疑问，我们在工人群众中的时事政治教育工作是有成绩的。很多地方在解放以后，曾经进行过关于社会发展史、民主改革等政治学习，我们两年多来的工人运动在这个基础取得了一定的成绩。但是，仅仅由于这样，我们有的同志就认为政治教育在工人群众中已经进行得差不多了；有的同志在工作中看到很多热烈的场面，因而不加分析地认为工人群众的政治觉悟已经是没有问题了，于是对工人群众的思想状况采取了不闻不问的态度，对于自己日常进行的时事宣传和中心工作的宣传自满起来。以为这些就可以解决工作当中发生的问题，以为进行什么正规的政治学习是没有什么必要了。向工人群众经常进行时事宣传和中心工作的宣传是经常不可缺少的，今后还应该继续加紧进行。就像今天对于增产节约的宣传一样，它会使政治教育的内容更加丰富起来。但仅有时事宣传和中心工作宣传是不能满足工人群众的要求的。
    为了能够认真地在工人群众中进行共产主义的教育，必须反对将政治教育和文化教育、技术教育对立起来的错误思想。有人说：“共产主义的理论工人是听不懂的”，“没有一定的文化，是不能学共产主义理论的”。于是，有的工厂的业余学校，就根本不上政治课。毫无疑问，文化学习和技术学习是广大工人的迫切要求，不顾工人这种文化上的迫切要求是错误的，但离开了政治学习去孤立地进行文化学习和技术学习，是十分错误的，必须使两者密切结合起来，同时必须进行系统的政治教育。很多已经开始有系统地进行共产主义教育的地方的经验证明：工人群众不但可能学习共产主义理论，而且可以学得很好。很多工人在受到共产主义教育以后，就大大鼓励了自己学习文化的兴趣，这是完全可以理解的。为了能够认真地在工人群众中进行共产主义的教育，必须反对企图取消在工人群众中进行政治教育的错误思想。有些企业部门的领导人员说：“我没有进行系统的政治教育，我的生产也搞得不错。”这些同志满足于眼前的任务能够顺利完成，但没有想到如何才能从根本上提高工人群众的积极性和创造性，对于工人群众学习政治的热烈要求熟视无睹。产生这种思想毛病的原因，是他们还没有全心全意地依靠工人阶级，他们不懂得从政治上启发工人群众的生产热情是企业领导干部的重要责任。他们觉得自己的工作已经作得差不多了，因而对在工
    人群众中进行共产主义教育的工作表示了冷淡。这种偏向是应该坚决纠正的。
