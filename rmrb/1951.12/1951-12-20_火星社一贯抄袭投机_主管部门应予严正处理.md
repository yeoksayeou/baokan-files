	The Mars Society Consistently Plagiarizes and Speculates
	Competent Authorities Should Severely Punish Them
	Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on October 12th published Comrade Wang Menghua's exposure of the Mars Society's plagiarism of her translated work "Children's Education in the Family and School" for publication. This incident is by no means an accidental act of the Mars Society. We have studied some translated books published by the Mars Society and found that at least the following four books are entirely or partially plagiarized:
	1.	"The Makarenko Educational System" (translated by Su Hua, published in September 1950). It is completely identical to "Makarenko's Life and His Educational Theory" edited by the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and translated by Zhang Zhangli (Xinhua Bookstore, first edition in July 1950) in terms of sentence structure and writing style, except that the former made some literal changes. A significant trace of plagiarism is that it also inherited some errors from Zhang's translation.
	2.	"The Soviet Economic Accounting System" (translated by Peng Wenhua, published in December 1950). This book is just an article by Brieger. This article was originally included in "The Economic Accounting System" published by Xinhua Bookstore in September 1950, originally titled "The Essence of the Soviet Economic Accounting System," translated by Song Qijiang and Zhao Kecheng. Peng Wenhua's translation by the Mars Society is so similar to this translation that it is difficult to distinguish.
	3.	"The Basic Tasks of the Soviet Economy" (translated by Guan Muna, published in June 1950). This book includes three short articles. Among them, the article "Saving is an Important Economic Task" has been found to be originally translated by Shu Lin, and was included in "Strengthening Economic Accounting System and Overcoming Waste in Industrial Production" published by Northeast Xinhua Bookstore (first edition in September 1949).
	4.	"Soviet Higher Education" (compiled by Liu Junshi, published in June 1950). This includes six short articles, of which three have been found to have sources of plagiarism: the article "Soviet Higher Education" is copied from He Zhongliang's translation in the ninth issue of the second volume of the former "Sino-Soviet Culture" magazine; the article "The System of Soviet Higher Education" is copied from Wang Fan's translation of "The Organization of Soviet Higher Education" in the People's Daily on February 6, 1950; the article "The Combination of Science and Production in Higher Education" is copied from Han Lingrui's translation published in Guangming Daily on May 28, 1950.
	The plagiarism style in the publishing industry is not an isolated phenomenon. This shows that the old ideological style is still seriously eroding our publishing industry and damaging the purity and health of the people's publishing cause. It is intolerable for publishers like the Mars Society to systematically and plannedly plagiarize the labor achievements of others, infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of their peers, and deceive the general readers to profit themselves.
					Wang Dabai
	Editor's Note: The actual person in charge of the Mars Society, named He Ying, is a publisher who makes a living by speculation and opportunism. Since March 1950, the Mars Society has successively published 28 kinds of books, most of which are crudely made or pieced together from various sources. After this newspaper published Comrade Wang Menghua's accusation letter, the Mars Society sent us a "self-criticism" letter, brazenly claiming: "The original manuscript of the book was submitted by Shao Mianyu from Dalian University in early March this year. At that time, it was not noticed that it was copied from 'People's Education'." An investigation revealed that there is no such person as Shao Mianyu at Dalian University. This kind of behavior of not honestly admitting mistakes after being exposed, and still trying to deny and deceive, is intolerable, and it is necessary for the broad masses of readers, authors, and publishers to thoroughly expose it, and the administrative departments in charge should impose sanctions.

### 火星社一贯抄袭投机  主管部门应予严正处理

    火星社一贯抄袭投机
    主管部门应予严正处理
    编辑同志：十月十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了汪孟华同志揭露火星社剽窃她的“家庭与学校的儿童教育”译文加以出版的事。这件事决不是火星社偶然的行径。我们曾把火星社出版的一些翻译书研究了一下，发现至少还有下面四种书是全部或局部抄袭的：
    一、“马加林柯教育体系”（署名苏华译，一九五○年九月版）。它和中苏友好协会总会编、张章立译的“马卡伦柯的生平及其教育学说”一书，（新华书店一九五○年七月初版）在词句组织上、笔调上完全相同，只是前者作了一些字面的改动。一个显著的抄袭痕迹是把张译的某些错误也承袭过来了。
    二、“苏联经济核算制度”（署名彭文华译，一九五○年十二月版）。这本书只是勃列格里的一篇文章。这篇文章原来收在新华书店一九五○年九月初版的“经济核算制”一书中，原题为“苏联经济核算制的本质”，是由松启江、赵克城译的。火星社的彭文华译本和这篇译文相似得难以辨认。
    三、“苏联经济基本任务”（署名关沐南译，一九五○年六月版）。这本书包括了三篇短文。其中“节约是重要的经济任务”一文已查出原是舒林译的，曾收入东北新华书店出版的“加强经济核算制克服工业生产中的浪费”（一九四九年九月初版）一书中。
    四、“苏联高等教育”（署名刘君实编译，一九五○年六月版）。这里包括六篇短文，其中有三篇已查出抄袭来源：“苏联高等教育”一文抄自前
    “中苏文化”杂志第二卷第九期上何忠良的译文；“苏联高等教育的制度”一文抄自一九五○年二月六日人民日报上王繁译的“苏联高等教育底组织”；“高等学校的科学与生产的结合”一文抄自一九五○年五月二十八日光明日报所载韩灵锐的译文。
    目前出版界的抄袭作风并不是个别的现象。这表示旧的思想作风仍在严重地侵蚀着我们的出版事业，损害人民出版事业的纯洁和健康。像火星社这样有系统有计划地剽窃他人的劳动成果，侵害同业的正当权益，欺骗广大读者以牟利自肥的出版商，是令人不能容忍的。    王大白
    编者按：火星社的实际负责人名何英，是一个以投机取巧为业的出版商。从一九五○年三月以来，火星社先后出版了书籍二十八种，其中绝大部分是粗制滥造或东抄西凑的。本报登出汪孟华同志的检举信以后，火星社曾给我们一封“检讨”信，公然诡称：“该书原稿是今年三月初由大连大学邵勉予投来的。当时并未察觉系抄自‘人民教育’。”经调查大连大学根本没有邵勉予其人。这种在被揭露后不老实承认错误，仍企图抵赖蒙骗的行为，是不能容忍的，广大的读者、作者和出版者彻底加以揭露是必要的，行政主管部门应当予以制裁。
