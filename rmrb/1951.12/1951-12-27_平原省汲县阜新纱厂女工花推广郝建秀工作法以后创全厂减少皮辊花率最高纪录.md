     Female worker at the Fuxin Yarn Factory in Jixian County, Pingyuan Province
    Zhang Ronghua set a factory record for reducing the roller lap rate after promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
    Comrade Editor: Since the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was widely promoted in the fine yarn workshop of the Fuxin Yarn Factory in Jixian County, Pingyuan Province, the fine yarn female worker Zhang Ronghua has been the most active in learning it. From November 13th to 15th, Zhang Ronghua's roller lap rate averaged 0.227 percent, a decrease of 87.5 percent compared to before the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, setting the factory's highest record for reducing the roller lap rate. The main reason why Zhang Ronghua was able to achieve such results is that she further enriched the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in the splicing method. In addition to tearing the sliver, guiding the yarn, and clamping the ends according to the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, she also puts the bobbin in her left hand and hangs the yarn guide hook in her right hand, and splices the ends at the same time as clamping the ends. This reduces waste, saves time, and eliminates the phenomenon of tight-twist yarn. The tearing sliver action is also faster and more agile. When two broken ends are together, she tears them simultaneously up and down with both hands, thus saving the time of the drawing roller. Now, all the employees of the factory have expressed their intention to learn from Zhang Ronghua, improve their operating methods, and complete the plan of increasing production and saving 1.5 million jin of grain.

     平原省汲县阜新纱厂女工
    张荣花推广郝建秀工作法以后创全厂减少皮辊花率最高纪录
    编辑同志：平原省汲县阜新纱厂细纱间普遍推广郝建秀工作法以来，细纱女工张荣花学习得最积极。十一月十三日到十五日，张荣花的皮辊花平均为百分之零点二二七，较推广郝建秀工作法以前降低百分之八十七点五，创这个厂减少皮辊花率的最高纪录。张荣花所以能有这样成绩，主要是在接头方法上，进一步丰富了郝建秀工作法。她除了撕花、引纱、拤头等都按照郝建秀工作法操作外，她又左手放纱管，右手挂导纱钩，和拤头同时进行接头。这样就减少了回丝，节省了时间，杜绝了紧捻纱的现象。撕花动作也更迅速、敏捷了。当两个断头在一起时，她便用两手交差上下同时撕，因而节省了抽绒辊的时间。现在，全厂职工都表示要向张荣花学习，改进操作方法，完成增产节约一百五十万斤粮食的计划。    郭荣
