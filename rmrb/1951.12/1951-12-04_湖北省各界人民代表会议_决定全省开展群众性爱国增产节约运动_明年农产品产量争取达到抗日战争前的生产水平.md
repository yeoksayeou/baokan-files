Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd—The Second First All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Hubei Province, acting in place of the People's Congress, focused on discussing the issue of increasing production and practicing thrift throughout the province. The conference was held from November 23rd to December 1st. Li Xiannian, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, presented suggestions to the conference regarding the working guidelines and tasks for Hubei Province in 1952. He said: Next year, the province should strive for an overall 10% increase in the production of agricultural products such as grain and cotton on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, reaching the production levels before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In industry, it is necessary to mobilize the masses of workers to fully utilize equipment, save raw materials, and accelerate capital turnover to increase production. Government agencies must implement and abide by financial discipline and oppose extravagance and waste. Li Xiannian suggested making increasing production and practicing thrift the main content of patriotic pledges and launching a mass movement to increase production and practice thrift.

After full discussion, the representatives unanimously expressed their support for Li Xiannian's suggestions and pledged to implement them. Yang Xiaojin, a worker representative from Yingcheng Gypsum Mine, studied the conditions of the mine and proposed to mobilize the mine's workers to increase production efficiency by 5% to 10%, utilize waste materials, and ensure that the mine increases production and practices thrift equivalent to 100 million yuan of wealth for the country each month. Farmer representatives were all full of confidence in completing the plan to increase production by 10% next year. Farmer representative Rao Xingli said: The farmers in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, have already made plans to increase production and practice thrift, striving to have one-third of the township's farmers participate in mutual aid groups next year; at the same time, they will vigorously improve seeds, and all rice and cotton fields will be planted with "Victory Xian" rice and "Dai Zi" cotton next year. We have also agreed not to host banquets, not to give gifts, and to break superstitions, which will save each person at least ten jin of rice per year, which can be used to purchase production materials. In this way, we will definitely be able to complete the task of increasing grain and cotton production by 10% next year. Representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors proposed to rely on workers, improve operations, and not evade taxes, so as to increase the wealth of the country.

The conference decided that the people's governments at all levels in the province should establish committees for increasing production and practicing thrift and formulate specific plans for increasing production and practicing thrift in order to promote the movement to increase production and practice thrift. Hubei Province has now completed land reform in areas with 11.5 million agricultural population, and in areas with the remaining 13 million population, movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and reducing rent have also been carried out, and the peasants have been mobilized. The conference decided that land reform must be completed throughout the province this winter and next spring, and the areas that have been completed should conscientiously do a good job in the land reform review. The conference discussed the issue of conducting democratic reforms in cities and towns in a guided manner and adopted Li Xiannian's suggestions on the working guidelines and tasks for 1952 as the resolution of the conference.

Through the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the people of Hubei Province have greatly improved and developed politically and organizationally. Eighty percent of the representatives who participated in this conference were democratically elected by grassroots organizations of the masses. Before the conference, each city and county generally convened a people's representative conference of all circles. This conference, acting in place of the Provincial People's Congress, elected the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen and all members of the Provincial People's Government Committee.

    湖北省各界人民代表会议
    决定全省开展群众性爱国增产节约运动
    明年农产品产量争取达到抗日战争前的生产水平
    【新华社武昌三日电】代行人民代表大会职权的湖北省第二届第一次各界人民代表会议，着重讨论了全省增产节约问题。会议在上月二十三日到本月一日举行。中共湖北省委员会书记李先念向大会提出关于湖北省一九五二年工作方针和任务的建议。他说：明年全省粮食、棉花等农业产品的产量，争取在今年丰收的基础上全面增产百分之十，达到抗日战争前的生产水平。工业方面，要发动工人群众充分发挥设备的利用率，节省原料，加速资金周转，以增加生产。政府机关要贯彻遵守财政纪律，反对铺张浪费。李先念建议把增产节约作为爱国公约的主要内容，开展一个群众性的增产节约运动。
    经过充分讨论，代表们对李先念的建议一致表示拥护，并保证要贯彻执行。应城石膏矿工人代表杨小金，研究了该矿的条件，提出要动员该矿工人提高生产效率百分之五到百分之十，利用废料，保证每月为国家增产节约等于一亿元的财富。农民代表对完成明年增产一成的计划，都充满信心。农民代表饶兴礼说：我们浠水县望城乡的农民，已经订出了增产节约计划，争取全乡三分之一的农民在明年内参加互助组；同时，要大力改良种子，谷田和棉田明年全种“胜利籼”和“岱字棉”。我们并约定不请客，不送礼，破除迷信，从这方面每人一年至少可以节省十斤米，用来购买生产资料。这样我们明年增产一成粮食和棉花是一定可以完成的。工商界代表提出要依靠工人，改善经营，不偷税漏税，增加国家的财富。
    会议决定全省各级人民政府成立增产节约委员会，制订具体的增产节约计划，以便推动增产节约运动。湖北省现已在一千一百五十万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，其余一千三百万人口的地区也进行了清剿土匪、反对恶霸、减租等运动，农民已经发动起来。会议决定今冬明春必须在全省完成土地改革，已经完成的地区要认真做好土地改革复查工作。会议讨论了有领导地进行城镇民主改革等问题，并通过了李先念关于一九五二年工作方针和任务的建议为大会决议。
    湖北省人民经过抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，在政治上、组织上都有很大的提高和发展。参加这次会议的代表百分之八十是由群众的基层组织民主选举出来的。会前，各市、县一般都召开过一次各界人民代表会议。这次会议代行省人民代表大会职权，选举了省人民政府委员会主席、副主席和全体委员。
