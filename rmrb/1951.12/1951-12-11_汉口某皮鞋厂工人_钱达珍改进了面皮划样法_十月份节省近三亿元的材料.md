Hankou Leather Shoe Factory Worker
    Qian Dazhen Improves Leather Patterning Method
    October Savings Approach 300 Million Yuan in Materials

    To the Editor: Qian Dazhen, the head of the leather face group at a leather shoe factory in Hankou, improved the leather patterning method during the increase production and practice economy movement, saving over 290 million yuan each month. He noticed that there were many materials suitable for tongue leather and heel leather in the collected scrap leather. He thought: It is a pity to discard such good materials. To respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, a way must be found to correct this waste. Driven by this thought, and with the assistance of all workers in the group, he improved the leather patterning method. In the past, the patterns were arranged corner to corner, leaving too much empty space in the seams. Now, they are arranged corner to palm edge, which reduces the empty space in the middle. At the same time, they avoid cutting the middle seam when patterning, preventing the waste of cutting a whole piece of face leather (that cannot be made into a pair) into tongue leather and heel leather, as was done in the past. According to incomplete statistics from October: After improving the patterning method, the face leather consumption per pair of shoes decreased from 1.9 square feet to 1.703 square feet, saving a total of over 294 million yuan in face leather and reverse side leather for the entire month.

    汉口某皮鞋厂工人
    钱达珍改进了面皮划样法
    十月份节省近三亿元的材料
    编辑同志：汉口某皮鞋厂面皮组小组长钱达珍，在增产节约运动中，改进了面皮划样法，每月可节省二亿九千多万元。他每天看到在扫集的渣子皮里，有很多能作舌头皮和根子皮用的材料。他想：这样好的材料，丢了实在可惜，要响应毛主席的增产节约号召，就必须想个办法来纠正这种浪费。他在这个思想的主使下，在全组工人的协助下，改进了面皮划样法。过去的样子是角对角，夹缝内空地太大，现在改为角对掌口，中间的空地就缩小了。同时，他们在划皮时不剪中缝，避免了过去把整块面皮（不能做一双的）划做舌头皮和根子皮的浪费现象。据十月份不完全统计：改进划样法后，每双皮鞋面皮由一点九方尺降为一点七○三方尺，全月共节约正面皮和反面皮值人民币两亿九千四百多万元。　熊伯涛
