Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th. The Northwest China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a mobilization meeting on increasing production and practicing economy on the 7th. More than 1,400 party member cadres from directly affiliated organs of the Northwest Bureau, Shaanxi Province, and Xi'an City attended the meeting. At the meeting, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report entitled "Continue to Oppose Bureaucratism, Oppose Corruption, and Oppose Waste, and Strive to Launch the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy." After analyzing the current domestic and international situation, the work situation in the Northwest region, and the great significance of launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, Xi Zhongxun said: The movement to increase production and practice economy in the Northwest region has been initially launched. Judging only from the fourth-quarter production increase and economy plans formulated by eighteen industrial and mining enterprises published in Xi'an newspapers in recent days, the total value of increased production and economy is more than 57 billion yuan, plus 1,790 tons of grain. Some rural areas have also begun to formulate plans to increase production and practice economy, but the entire movement is still in a spontaneous initial stage.

Xi Zhongxun pointed out: Many cadres, because they do not understand the positive significance of increasing production and practicing economy for building the motherland, mistakenly believe that: increasing production and practicing economy is a shock movement; the Northwest is poor and cannot save anything; waste is less harmful than corruption; increasing production and practicing economy is a matter for financial departments, etc. After criticizing these erroneous understandings one by one, he listed several corruption cases and waste phenomena in the Northwest region and emphasized that the emergence of corruption and waste phenomena is due, on the one hand, to the fact that in the peaceful environment of revolutionary victory, various non-proletarian ideologies are fiercely eroding the Party, and some people with unstable class positions and low political awareness cannot withstand this test and have embarked on the path of degeneration; on the other hand, there is serious bureaucratism in the work of certain leading organs and leading cadres. Therefore, we must first adopt the method of rectification, and on the basis of opposing corruption and waste and opposing bureaucratism, launch the movement to increase production and practice economy. In industrial and mining enterprises, we should rely on the masses of workers, unite employees and technicians, first check and eliminate various phenomena of corruption and waste, raise the consciousness of the masses, formulate practical plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and unleash the potential power of the masses and machinery and equipment to comprehensively launch the movement to increase production and practice economy. In all other departments, we should, without exception, rapidly launch rectification movements, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and lay a solid foundation for launching a mass-based long-term movement to increase production and practice economy. In the rectification, model cadres who "spend less money to do big things" and have achieved results in protecting state property must be commended; those corrupt elements who seriously damage national interests must be dealt with according to the circumstances of their cases and the degree of their confession and repentance. The Northwest China-level Party organizations and the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPC must begin to lead this work within this month.

Xi Zhongxun finally called on all Communist Party members in the Northwest region to take immediate action, become models for the people, and strive to victoriously launch the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    中共中央西北局召开增产节约动员大会
    习仲勋同志号召反对贪污浪费和官僚主义
    【新华社西安九日电】中共中央西北局七日召开增产节约动员大会，到会的有西北局、陕西省和西安市各直属机关党员干部一千四百多人。会上，中共中央西北局书记习仲勋作了“继续反对官僚主义、反对贪污、反对浪费，为开展增产节约运动而斗争”的报告。习仲勋在分析了目前国内外形势、西北区的工作情况和开展增产节约运动的重大意义后，他说：西北区增产节约运动已初步发动起来，仅就西安报纸连日刊载的十八个工矿企业单位制订的第四季度增产节约计划，增产节约的总值就有五百七十多亿元，另粮食一千七百九十吨；部分农村也开始订出增产节约计划，但整个运动还在自发的初期的状态中。
    习仲勋指出：许多干部由于不了解增产节约对于建设祖国的积极意义，错误地认为：增产节约是突击运动；西北穷、节约不出东西；浪费比贪污危害性小；增产节约是财经部门的事等等。他逐一批判了这些错误认识后，又列举目前西北区若干贪污案件和工作中的浪费现象，着重指出：贪污浪费现象的产生，一方面是在革命胜利的和平环境下，各种非无产阶级意识猛烈地向党内侵蚀，一部分阶级立场不稳、政治觉悟不高的分子经不起这种考验，走上了蜕化的道路；另一方面是在若干领导机关和领导干部的工作中，存在着严重的官僚主义。因此，必须首先采用整风的方法，在反对贪污浪费、反对官僚主义的基础上，开展增产节约运动。在工矿企业部门，应该依靠全体工人群众、团结职员技师，首先检查和消灭各种贪污浪费现象，提高群众觉悟，制订出切合实际的增产节约计划，发挥群众和机器设备的潜在力量，全面地开展增产节约运动。在其他一切部门，应无例外地迅速开展整风运动，发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，为开展群众性的长期增产节约运动奠定巩固的基础。在整风中，对于那些“钱少办大事”、爱护国家财产有成绩的模范干部必须表扬；对于严重损害国家利益的贪污分子要依据其案情和坦白、悔改的程度分别处理。中共西北区级党的组织和中共西安市委员会在本月份内就须着手领导这一工作。
    习仲勋最后号召西北区全体共产党员立即行动起来，成为人民群众的表率，为胜利地开展增产节约运动而奋斗。
