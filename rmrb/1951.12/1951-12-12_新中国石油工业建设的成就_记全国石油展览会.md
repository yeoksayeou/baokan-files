Achievements in Petroleum Industry Construction in New China
    ——Notes on the National Petroleum Exhibition
    Qiao Yuzhou

    After visiting the petroleum exhibition, people will deeply feel that in just two years, China's petroleum industry has achieved great victories.

    In the past, when people mentioned China's petroleum industry, those familiar with China's industrial situation would invariably shake their heads. However, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, in just two years, the people's petroleum industry has taken on a completely new look: new oil reservoirs have been discovered; new oil wells have been established; what is sold in the domestic market is no longer petroleum from "Mobil," "Texaco," and "Asiatic" Petroleum Company, but petroleum produced from the people's own mines.

    Our motherland has abundant oil reserves. On a map with illuminated symbols hanging at the entrance of the exhibition, it can be seen that from the Tarim and Junggar basins in the northwest corner of the motherland, along the Qilian Mountains eastward to the North China Plain, from Fuxin in the northeast to the Guizhou-Yunnan Plateau and the hills of Hunan and Guangxi, as well as the Sichuan Basin, there are abundant oil reserves everywhere. However, for many years, under reactionary rule and imperialist plunder, China's petroleum industry could not develop.

    When the petroleum industry returned to the hands of the people, its old face immediately changed. In the exhibition hall, there are models of two huge factories: one is a thermal cracking refinery of a certain oil mine, and the other is a synthetic plant that is rare in the world. Both of these plants were newly built by the people themselves. The construction of the former factory took only four months, whereas it would have taken at least two years to build it before liberation. The creation of the synthetic plant also has a long history. When the Japanese invaders were here, it was suspended midway due to technical failures. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it was not only not built, but it was also dismantled and destroyed. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of Soviet experts, it was built successfully in just two years and began production. This is a major event in China's petroleum industry. The successful renovation of the cracking refinery increased the gasoline refining rate (the ratio of crude oil to gasoline produced) of a certain mine from 37 percent to more than 50 percent.

    The biggest achievement in the people's petroleum industry in the past two years has been in exploration. The exploration team in 1951 was twice the size of that in 1949. Before liberation, the reactionary government did not invest in oil exploration well projects; after liberation, the People's Government's investment in exploration well projects accounted for 76 percent of the total investment in the petroleum industry.

    China's drilling capacity in the petroleum industry has increased rapidly. If the total depth of wells drilled in 1949 is 4.8, it has reached 12.2 from January to September 1951, and it is expected to reach 17 by the end of this year. Thanks to the efforts of the working class, it has been possible to manufacture hundreds of types of accessories for drilling tools. The Great Northwest is a cold area, and in the past, drilling was often impossible for three or four months in winter. However, by learning from the Soviet experience and adding insulation equipment, the efficiency of drilling equipment has increased by a quarter, enabling drilling work to proceed quickly and smoothly.

    China's crude oil production and refining capacity in the petroleum industry have also increased greatly. From the charts, it can be seen that the crude oil production plan for 1951 is 170 percent of the previous year; the kerosene production this year has increased by about 40 percent compared with the previous year; and the gasoline production this year will increase by about 55 percent compared with the previous year. The output of various major products has now exceeded the highest record in previous years. From January to August this year, crude oil production exceeded the same period last year by 43.3 percent, and gasoline production exceeded the same period last year by 33.7 percent. With the restoration and development of the petroleum industry, the oil pool capacity of the China Petroleum Company has increased by one and a half times compared with before liberation, the number of warehouses has increased by 90 percent, and the number of employees has increased by 29.38 percent. Ninety percent of China's existing natural petroleum refining equipment was completed after liberation.

    In addition, many new achievements in artificial petroleum have opened up new and broad avenues for China to refine various fuels.

    We are not satisfied with the achievements we have made. There are even greater prospects before us: the model of developing the Great Northwest in the exhibition is the most eye-catching. To the east of this model is the Shaanxi oil-producing area. To the southwest, in two inverted figure-eight-shaped areas, are the Longdong and Longzhong areas. Further northwest is the Hexi Corridor. Further west is the Qaidam Basin, the Tarim Basin, and the Junggar Basin. We are about to transform this area, which has always been considered barren, into one of the industrial areas of the motherland. Now, many pioneers are already working here. From the photos hanging in the exhibition, you can see the geological personnel who brave the severe cold of minus 30 degrees to develop the motherland's petroleum industry and run around in remote mountains and wilderness, the experts from the Soviet Union, the workers who exert creative labor, the people's engineers who improved the DC amplifier, and the college students from Beijing, Tianjin and other places who came to the mine to practice in order to build the future people's motherland's petroleum industry.

    The latter part of the exhibition consists of charts and models related to petroleum trade and petroleum uses. In this small exhibition room, you will feel the earth-shaking changes in China's petroleum industry. Here is a map of the imperialist oil merchants' monopoly in the Chinese market before liberation. The chart shows that the distribution agencies of imperialist oil companies are distributed in thousands of towns and cities throughout eastern and central-southern China. For decades, it sucked the blood and sweat of the Chinese people and strangled China's petroleum industry. From 1905 to 1949 (three years without imports after the War of Resistance Against Japan), the value of imperialist petroleum imports reached more than 3.2779 billion US dollars, equivalent to more than 58.4 billion jin of millet. However, since the Central People's Government announced the control of American property in China in December 1950 and announced the requisition of the British "Asiatic" Petroleum Company in April this year, the imperialist oil merchants' monopoly of the Chinese petroleum market has disappeared forever. Replacing it is China's own petroleum company and petroleum from the people's own oil fields. The achievements in China's petroleum industry construction in the past two years have completely overturned the imperialist "scholars'" fabricated argument that "China is a petroleum 'anemic' country." This is a great victory for China's petroleum industry, and we heartily congratulate it!

    新中国石油工业建设的成就
    ——记全国石油展览会
    乔雨舟
    参观了石油展览会，人们就会深深地感到：在短短的两年时间中，我国人民的石油事业已获得了伟大的胜利。
    在过去，提起中国的石油事业来，了解中国工业情况的人，没有不摇头的。但是，在中央人民政府领导下，仅仅两年，人民的石油事业已面貌一新了：新的油藏被发现了；新的油井建立起来了；行销在国内市场上的，再不是“美孚”、“德士古”和“亚细亚”火油公司的石油，而是从人民自己的矿山出产的石油了。
    我们祖国是有着丰富的油藏的。在展览会门口挂着的一幅有着彩灯标志的地图上可以看到：从祖国西北角的塔里木、准噶尔两盆地沿着祁连山东下到冀鲁豫平原，从东北的阜新到黔滇高原和湘桂丘陵地带以及四川盆地，到处都有着丰富的油藏。但是，多少年来，在反动统治和帝国主义的掠夺下，中国的石油事业却不能有所发展。
    当石油工业回到了人民手里以后，它的旧面貌就立即改变了。在展览室里，陈列着两个巨大的工厂的模型：一个是某油矿的热裂炼厂，另一个是在全世界少有的合成厂。这两个厂，都是人民自己新建的。前一个厂的兴建只花了四个月的时间，而这在解放前至少需要两年时间才能修建成功。合成厂的创建，说起来历史也算不短了。日寇在的时候，因为技术失败，曾中途停止。国民党反动统治时期，不仅不建设，反而拆毁和破坏。解放后，工人们在共产党的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，仅仅两年就把它建造成功，并开始生产了。这是中国石油工业上的大事。裂炼厂的改建成功，使某矿的汽油炼率（原油和所炼出的汽油的比率）由过去的百分之三十七提高到百分之五十以上。
    两年来人民石油事业上最大的成绩，是在探勘方面。探勘队一九五一年比一九四九年扩大了两倍。解放前，反动政府是没有投资于石油探井工程的；解放后，人民政府在探井工程上的投资，就占了石油工业总投资的百分之七十六。
    我国石油工业的钻井能力已经飞速提高，假如一九四九年所钻的井的深度加起来是四点八，一九五一年一月到九月就已达到十二点二，预计到今年年底将会达到十七。由于工人阶级的努力，已能自制几百种钻井工具的配件。大西北是寒冷的地带，过去，在冬季，常常有三、四个月是不能钻井的。但是，由于学习了苏联的经验，添装了保暖设备，钻杆设备的使用效率提高了四分之一，使钻井工作能够迅速顺利进行。
    我国石油工业的原油产量和炼制能力也大大提高了。从图表上可以看出：原油，一九五一年生产计划是前年的百分之一百七十；煤油，今年产量约比前年增加了百分之四十；汽油，今年产量比前年要增加约百分之五十五以上。各种主要产品，现在都已超过历年的最高纪录了。今年一月至八月的原油产量超过了去年同期百分之四十三点三，汽油产量超过去年同期百分之三十三点七。随着石油工业的恢复和发展，中国石油公司的油池容量比解放前增加了一倍半，仓库增加了百分之九十，职工人数增加了百分之二十九点三八。我国现有的天然石油的炼油设备，百分之九十是解放以后完成的。
    此外，在人造石油方面的许多新成就，更为我国制炼各种油料开辟了新的广阔道路。
    我们并不满足于我们已得的成就。在我们的面前，还有着更伟大的远景：展览会中开发大西北的模型是最引人注意的。在这模型的东边，是陕北产油区。从这向西南，在两块倒八字形的地方，是陇东和陇中区。再向西北，是河西走廊。再往西走，是柴达木盆地、塔里木盆地、准噶尔盆地。我们就要把这块从来人们认为是荒凉的地带变成祖国的工业区域之一。现在，许多拓荒者已经在这里工作了。从展览会上挂着的照片可以看到：那冒着零下三十度严寒而为着发展祖国石油事业奔走在荒山僻野的地质人员和来自苏联友邦的专家们，那发挥着创造性劳动的工人们，那改进直流放大器的人民工程师，那些为着建设未来人民祖国石油事业而来到矿场实习的来自北京、天津等地的大学生们。
    展览会的后一部分是有关石油贸易和石油用途的图表和模型。在这一个小小的展览室里，你会感觉到中国石油事业上翻天覆地的变化。这里有一张解放前帝国主义石油商在中国市场上的垄断图。图表显示帝国主义石油公司的分销机构分布在整个中国东部和中南部的千百个城镇里。几十年来，它吸吮着中国人民的血汗，扼杀了中国的石油工业。从一九○五年到一九四九年（抗战后三年无进口）这四十二年间，帝国主义石油进口的价值达到了三十二亿七千七百九十多万美元，折合小米五百八十四亿多斤。但是，从一九五○年十二月中央人民政府宣布管制美国在华财产，和今年四月宣布征用英商“亚细亚”火油公司以来，帝国主义石油商垄断中国石油市场的情况是一去不复返了。代之而来的，是中国人民自己的石油公司和人民自己油田里的石油。两年来我国石油工业建设工作上的成就，完全推翻了帝国主义“学者”捏造的“中国是石油‘贫血’国家”的论断。这是我国石油事业的伟大胜利，我们为它衷心祝贺！
    （按：全国石油展览会在北京市劳动人民文化宫举行，十一月十五日开始，预定十二月十五日闭幕。）
