    To the Editor: After the land reform in the rural areas of the suburbs of Shanghai, a bumper harvest was achieved this year. Some farmers, because they have more money in hand, have developed extravagance and waste in their lives, especially in weddings, funerals, and other matters. For example, Zhang Haofu, a farmer in Xinwan Village, Minsheng Township, Yangjing District, recently spent a total of 6 million yuan to bury his wife after she died. Another example is Shen Jinsheng, a farmer in Dongzhangjiawan Village, who spent more than 500,000 yuan on just one "three-day celebration" after his child was born last month. After land reform, farmers' incomes have generally increased. If we do not promptly carry out propaganda and education on increasing production and practicing economy and opposing waste, and eliminate this phenomenon of extravagance and waste, it will be detrimental to farmers' production and life. I hope this matter will attract the attention of rural workers across the country. Jiang Liu

    应对农民进行增产节约教育
    编辑同志：上海市郊区农村实行土地改革后，今年又得到丰收。有些农民因手头比较宽裕，在生活上，特别是在婚丧等事情上，就发生了铺张浪费现象。如洋泾区民生乡新湾村农民张好福最近死了老婆，一共化了六百多万元，才把老婆下了葬。又如东张家湾村农民沈金生，上月生了个孩子，只“三朝”一天就用去五十多万元。土地改革后的农村，农民收入一般都增多了，如果不及时进行增产节约，反对浪费的宣传教育，消灭这种铺张浪费现象，对农民的生产和生活都会是不利的。我希望这事能引起全国各地农村工作者的注意。　江　流
