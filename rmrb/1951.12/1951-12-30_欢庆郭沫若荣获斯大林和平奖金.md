    Celebrating Guo Moruo's Receipt of the Stalin Peace Prize
    Editor: We were extremely excited when we saw in the newspaper the news that Mr. Guo Moruo had been awarded the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace." We pay the highest respect to Mr. Guo Moruo, who has devoted his life to the cause of peace. We feel infinite glory and pride, because as Mr. Guo Moruo said, "This is not given to me personally, but to all the Chinese people who are fighting 'to strengthen international peace' under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao." Last year, Ms. Soong Ching Ling won the Stalin Prize, and this year, Mr. Guo Moruo has also received this honor. This is the glory of all the Chinese people, which proves how significant our Chinese people's contribution is to defending world peace.
    The establishment of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace" and the continuous increase in the number of outstanding fighters for the defense of world peace prove the increasing growth of the world's peace and democratic forces. We must take practical actions to strengthen the forces for defending world peace and strive for greater glory and victory!

    欢庆郭沫若荣获斯大林和平奖金
    编辑同志：当我们在报上看到郭沫若先生荣获“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的消息以后，真是兴奋极了。我们向毕生为和平事业而奋斗的郭沫若先生致崇高的敬意。我们感到无限的光荣和骄傲，因为正如郭沫若先生所说：“这并不是给予我个人，而是给予我们在英明领袖毛主席领导之下为‘加强国际和平’而奋斗的全中国人民”。去年宋庆龄先生荣获斯大林奖金，今年郭沫若先生又得到了这一荣誉。这是我们全中国人民的光荣，这证明了我们中国人民对于保卫世界和平，有着多么重大的贡献。
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的设立，保卫世界和平的卓越斗士的不断增加，证明了世界和平民主力量的日益增长。我们一定要用实际行动，加强保卫世界和平的力量，争取更大的光荣和胜利！
