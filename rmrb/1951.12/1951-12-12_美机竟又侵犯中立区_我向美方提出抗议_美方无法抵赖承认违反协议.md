The other party could not deny that a violation of the neutral zone agreement had indeed occurred, and admitted that the bombs and machine gun bullets were made in the United States, but claimed that an investigation was still required within the U.S. military.

    美机竟又侵犯中立区
    我向美方提出抗议
    美方无法抵赖承认违反协议
   【新华社开城十一日电】十一日零时四十五分，美方军用飞机一架又一次侵入中立区，在开城附近丽陵里地方投弹二枚，并施行机枪扫射。十一日上午八时三十分，我方联络官协同对方联络官进行实地调查，并向对方提出抗议。对方无从抵赖，承认确有违反中立区协议的事件发生，并承认炸弹及机枪子弹均系美国制造，但声称仍须在美军中进行调查。
