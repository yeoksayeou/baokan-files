China Textile Trade Union National Committee
Call to Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign

Comrades, textile workers across the country:

Chairman Mao has issued a great call to the people of the whole country to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." This is the most important central task of our country at present. All textile workers, technicians, management personnel, and all cadres of the textile trade union should take active action to respond to Chairman Mao's call and launch a production increase and thrift campaign.

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese textile workers have overcome many difficulties, restored production, launched patriotic labor competitions, and created the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and the "1951 Weaving Work Method," which greatly improved labor productivity and brought the production level to break through the highest historical record. However, there are still quite serious waste phenomena in our textile production, and the potential for production has not been fully realized. The National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union calls on all textile workers, technicians, management personnel, and all trade union cadres to actively learn the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and the "1951 Weaving Work Method," and continue to improve the operating methods of various production departments, and fully launch a production increase and thrift campaign. In addition to completing the 1952 production plan, strive to over fulfill the plan of increasing production and practicing thrift of 378.44 billion yuan decided by the National Textile Industry Conference.

In terms of increasing production:

Cotton textile factories should universally promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, increase unit output, and vigorously save cotton: In 1952, public and private factories across the country will increase the production of cotton yarn by 100,000 bales within the planned cotton consumption. Weaving factories should vigorously promote the 1951 Weaving Work Method, improve production efficiency, and increase the production of 3.6 million bolts of cloth.

Jute bag factories should increase the production of 1.95 million jute bags.

Textile machinery manufacturing plants should increase the production of 50,000 spindles.

Wool, printing and dyeing, silk, reproduction (knitting, etc.) factories should increase the production of 83.5 billion yuan of wealth.

In terms of practicing thrift and reducing costs:

The cost of each bale of yarn should be reduced by 3%; the cost of each bolt of cloth should be reduced by 2%; the cost of linen textiles should be reduced by 5%; the cost of printing and dyeing should be reduced by 7%; the cost of silk should be reduced by 3% to 5%; the cost of machinery manufacturing should be reduced by 27.8%; and the cost of reproductions should be reduced by 2%.

In terms of capital turnover:

State-owned factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai should accelerate capital turnover and save capital.

In order to over fulfill the production increase and thrift plan, trade union organizations at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party, formulate production increase and thrift plans for each factory in state-owned factories in coordination with the administration. In private factories, in accordance with the principle of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital," contracts should be signed with the capitalists to organize all employees to further launch patriotic competitions, and on the basis of increasing production and practicing thrift, improve workers' working conditions and material and cultural life.

In order to smoothly carry out the production increase and thrift campaign, all trade union cadres and all employees must actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and eliminate the phenomena of corruption and waste and bureaucratic style in textile enterprises. Through the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and production increase and thrift campaigns, we will further improve our political consciousness and technical level, improve production management, implement economic accounting, and comprehensively improve our work level.

    中国纺织工会全国委员会
    关于开展增产节约运动的号召全国纺织工人同志们：
    毛主席向全国人民提出了“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召。这是我们国家当前最重要的中心任务。全国纺织工人、技术人员、管理人员和纺织工会全体干部应积极行动起来，响应毛主席的号召，展开增产节约运动。
    解放以来，中国纺织工人在中国共产党的领导下，克服了许多困难，恢复了生产，展开爱国主义劳动竞赛，创造了“郝建秀工作法”和“一九五一织布工作法”，大大提高了劳动生产率，使生产水平突破了历史上的最高纪录。但是，我们纺织生产中还存在着相当严重的浪费现象，生产潜在力尚未充分发挥。中国纺织工会全国委员会号召全体纺织工人、技术人员、管理人员和全体工会干部，积极学习“郝建秀工作法”和“一九五一织布工作法”，并继续改进各个生产部门的操作方法，全面展开增产节约运动。除完成一九五二年生产计划外，为超额完成全国纺织工业会议决定的增产节约三七、八四四亿元的计划而奋斗。
    在增产方面：
    棉纺织厂，普遍推广郝建秀工作法，提高单位产量，大力节约用棉：一九五二年全国公私营厂在计划用棉的范围内，增产棉纱十万件。布场大力推广一九五一织布工作法，提高生产效率，增产三六○万匹布。
    麻袋厂，增产一九五万条麻袋。
    纺织机械制造厂，增产纱锭五万枚。
    毛、印染、丝、复制（针织等）等厂，增产八三五亿元的财富。
    在厉行节约减低成本方面：
    每件纱减低3％；每匹布减低2％；麻纺减低5％；印染减低7％；丝绸减低3％至5％；机械制造减低27．8％；复制品减低2％。
    在资金周转方面：
    天津、青岛、上海三地国营厂，加速资金周转，节约资金。
    为了超额完成增产节约计划，纺织工会各级组织必须在中国共产党各级党委的领导下，在国营厂中协同行政制订各厂增产节约计划，在私营厂中本着“发展生产，劳资两利”的原则，和资方订立合同，组织全体职工进一步展开爱国主义竞赛，并在增产节约的基础上，改善工人的劳动条件和物质文化生活。
    为顺利开展增产节约运动，全体工会干部和全体职工必须积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，肃清纺织企业中的贪污浪费现象和官僚主义作风。通过反贪污、反浪费及增产节约运动进一步提高政治觉悟、技术水平，改进生产管理，实施经济核算，把我们的工作水平全面地更加提高一步。
                    一九五一年十二月十九日
