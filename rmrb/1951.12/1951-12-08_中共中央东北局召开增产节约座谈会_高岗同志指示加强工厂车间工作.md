    Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Holds Symposium on Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Comrade Gao Gang Instructs to Strengthen Factory Workshop Work
    [This Dispatch] The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a symposium on increasing production and practicing economy on November 23, mainly to discuss how to improve the work of factory workshops. Comrade Gao Gang made important instructions at the meeting.
    The symposium was personally presided over by Comrade Gao Gang. The attendees included Comrade Kai Feng, Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, Comrade Ma Hong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Northeast Bureau, Comrade Song Ping, Secretary-General of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, Comrade Yuan Zhizhong, Deputy Director of the Office of the Ministry of Industry, and leading cadres of the Party, administration, and trade unions from advanced workshops such as the 12th Workshop of a certain factory, the 2nd Workshop of a certain factory, the New Processing Workshop of Machine Factory No. 6, the Steelmaking Workshop of Machine Factory No. 2, the Small Motor Workshop of Electric Factory No. 5, and the Copper Furnace Workshop of a Smelting Plant.
    After the cadres of the above-mentioned workshops respectively introduced the advanced experiences of their workshops, Comrade Gao Gang made important instructions regarding the current situation of the movement to increase production and practice economy.
    Comrade Gao Gang first elaborated on the achievements and significance of the movement. He said: By the end of October, the working class in Northeast China had increased production and saved more than 10 million tons of grain. This is a very great achievement. With their practical actions, the working class in Northeast China has enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call for increasing production and practicing economy, which is of utmost importance to developing the economy, consolidating national defense, and supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers. We must continue to deepen this movement and continuously accumulate funds to rapidly develop industry. Otherwise, it will be impossible to industrialize our country. And only through industrialization can our country be more consolidated, and can the lives of our people be continuously improved.
    Comrade Gao Gang then analyzed the reasons for achieving this result. He said: This is mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the awareness and production enthusiasm of the working class in Northeast China. The scale of the movement is larger than in previous movements, and the improvements in technical reform and technical management are particularly prominent. Without the mobilization of more than one million workers in Northeast China to use their brains and hands, it would have been impossible to achieve such great results. At the same time, the work of our leading cadres at all levels has also been more in-depth and specific than in the past. The coordination of political work and economic work has made great progress. In the past, people did not understand what political work in factories was all about. Everyone could say the phrase "relying on the working class," but many people had different views on how to rely on them. Therefore, in some factories, the responsibilities of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League were unclear, and they each did their own thing. Now these issues are gradually becoming clear, and everyone's views and work on many issues are gradually becoming consistent. At the same time, national production has increased, and workers' wages have also increased, deepening the understanding of the consistency between the personal interests and the national interests among employees. The working class's enthusiasm for labor has been combined with technological innovation. … All of this is a new phenomenon that has emerged in this movement. It is on this basis that we have achieved the result of increasing production and saving more than 10 million tons of grain.
    Comrade Gao Gang said: At present, to further deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, the most important thing is to strengthen workshop work. Because the workshop is the basic production unit, and workers carry out production in the workshop. To this end, the leading cadres of the Party committees, trade unions, and enterprise administrations in various cities, as well as the factory directors, Party secretaries, and trade union chairmen of factories, should often go to the workshops and lead and organize technical personnel and staff to go deep into the workshops to understand the situation, discover problems, and effectively solve them. Correct the style of leading personnel being high above and not going to the workshops, or not solving problems after going down.
    At this point, Comrade Gao Gang elaborated in detail on the main content of workshop work. He said: After the leading cadres go to the workshop, they mainly need to do the following three things:
    The first thing is political work. Comrade Gao Gang said that the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the factory must carry out political work around the specific production situation of each workshop, understand the political and ideological situation of the workers, explain the great principles to the workers, talk about communism and the Communist Party, and talk about the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, so that workers can recognize the relationship between the individual and the country, the part and the whole, and today and tomorrow, thereby further improving the workers' political awareness and labor enthusiasm. On this basis, launch a production competition, like the 12th workshop of a certain factory, and create a "full house red" competition movement for the group, the workshop, and even the entire factory.
    The second thing is technical work. Comrade Gao Gang said: Everyone knows that without technical improvements, it is impossible to fully utilize all the possibilities in our enterprises to increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. When the movement reaches the workshop, the first thing to do is to improve technical management. Today, we lack technology, and we should advocate attaching importance to technology and learning technology. If the more than one million workers in Northeast China now become skilled workers, then our production will be even better. Now the land reform across the country is about to be completed, and we will soon be building many new factories. But who will design the factories, who will install the machines, who will operate the machines, and who will lead and manage the production? If we do not have technology and do not have cadres who understand technology, then even if we have funds, the factory will have to remain unbuilt. Therefore, everyone must recognize: without technology and without science, it is impossible to develop industry and defeat the enemy. Of course, technology cannot play its positive role without being combined with politics. It should be said: "Attaching importance to technology is correct, and neglecting politics is wrong." Do not oppose the two. Our task is to make the workers' skills more proficient; at the same time, we must conduct political education to consolidate and further improve their enthusiasm for learning technology. The various political, cultural, and technical education in factories should be well coordinated. People who do political work must also learn technology. We emphasize technology, but the cadres of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the enterprise and the leading organs of industrial production do not understand technology and think that technical work is only the business of workers and technicians, which is wrong. If that is the case, it will hinder the progress of our cause.
    The third thing is wage and welfare work. Comrade Gao Gang said: Politics and technology are very important; but if we talk about technology every day and talk about politics every day, and cannot gradually and reasonably improve the material and cultural life of employees on the basis of developing production, it will not work. We must do a good job in wage, reward, and welfare work. We want to encourage those who have been rewarded to further study technology, and those who have not been rewarded to actively research and learn technology and strive to be rewarded. In order to implement the principle of distribution according to work, it is now necessary to promote the piece-rate wage system as much as possible. We should ensure that workers' wages increase appropriately with the increase in production. When implementing piece-rate wages, we must pay attention to and take care of veteran technicians so that their income can be reasonable. If we ignore this issue, we will make mistakes. We must encourage them, train them, and give full play to their role, and gradually promote them to positions of managing and guiding production in a planned way.
    Finally, Comrade Gao Gang called on cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League at all levels, as well as technical personnel and staff, to go deep into the workshops. Go to the workshops to understand the workers' ideological situation, technical situation, labor organization situation, and the situation of workers' living and working conditions. We must deeply discover problems and specifically help solve them. We must enlighten the workers on what they do not understand, be good at guiding them on where to put their efforts, and keep them always full of political enthusiasm, labor enthusiasm, and enthusiasm for learning technology. If the workers' awareness and technology are improved and their lives are improved, they will create more wealth for the country, and the task of increasing production and practicing economy will be completed more and better.

    中共中央东北局召开增产节约座谈会
    高岗同志指示加强工厂车间工作
    【本报讯】中共中央东北局于十一月二十三日召开增产节约座谈会，主要讨论如何搞好工厂车间工作的问题。高岗同志在会上作了重要指示。
    座谈会由高岗同志亲自主持。出席会议的有中共沈阳市委书记凯丰同志、东北局副秘书长马洪同志、东北总工会秘书长宋平同志、工业部办公室副主任袁执中同志以及某厂十二车间、某厂第二车间、机器六厂新加工车间、机器二厂炼钢车间、电工五厂小型电机车间、冶炼厂铜炉车间等先进车间的党、行政、工会领导干部。
    上述各车间的干部分别介绍了本车间的先进经验后，高岗同志针对目前增产节约运动的情况，作了重要指示。
    高岗同志首先阐述了运动的成绩和意义。他说：到十月底止，全东北的工人阶级已增产节约了一千多万吨粮食。这是一个十分巨大的成绩。东北工人阶级以自己的实际行动，热烈地响应了毛主席增产节约的伟大号召，这对发展经济、巩固国防、支援中国人民志愿军有极其重要的意义。我们必须继续深入这一运动，不断地积累资金，以迅速地发展工业。否则就无法使我们的国家工业化。而只有工业化，才能使我们的国家更加巩固，才能使我国人民的生活不断改善。
    高岗同志接着分析了获得这一成绩的原因。他说：这主要是由于东北工人阶级的觉悟与生产热情的空前提高。运动的规模比过去历次运动都大，特别在技术改革与技术管理上的改进更为突出。如果没有全东北一百多万工人起来动脑动手，是不可能获得这样大的成绩的。同时，我们各级领导干部的工作也比过去深入具体了。政治工作与经济工作的配合有了很大进步。过去不了解工厂里的政治工作搞什么，“依靠工人阶级”这句话，谁都会说，但是怎样靠法，许多人的看法却不一样。因此有些工厂中的党、行政、工会、青年团责任不清，各搞一套。现在这些问题逐渐搞清楚了，大家在对许多问题的观点上和工作上也都逐渐一致了。同时，国家的生产提高了，工人的工资也增加了，职工对个人利益与国家利益一致的认识体会得更深了。工人阶级的劳动热情与技术改革结合起来了。……这一切，都是这次运动中出现的新气象。就是在这样的基础上，得到了增产节约一千多万吨粮食的成绩。
    高岗同志说：目前要使增产节约运动更深入一步，最重要的是加强车间工作。因为车间是基本的生产单位，而工人就在车间里进行生产。为此，各城市的党委、工会与企业行政的领导干部，以及工厂的厂长、党委书记、工会主席，都应该经常下车间，并带领与组织技术人员、职员深入车间去了解情况，发现问题，切实解决。纠正那种领导人员高高在上不下车间，或下去之后不解决问题的作风。
    至此，高岗同志详细阐述了车间工作的主要内容。他说：领导干部下车间之后，主要要做好下列三件事：
    第一件是政治工作。高岗同志说工厂中的党、行政、工会、青年团都要围绕着各车间的具体生产情况去进行政治工作，了解工人的政治思想情况，向工人讲大道理，讲共产主义和共产党，讲增产节约的意义，使工人认清个人与国家、局部与全体、今天与明天的关系，从而把工人的政治觉悟和劳动热情再进一步提高，在这样的基础上展开生产竞赛，像某工厂十二车间那样，掀起小组的、车间的以至全厂的“满堂红”竞赛运动。
    第二件是技术工作。高岗同志说：大家都知道，没有技术上的改进，是无法充分运用我们企业中的一切可能性来提高生产、改进质量、降低成本的。运动搞到车间，首先就要搞好技术管理。今天我们缺乏技术，应该提倡重视技术、学习技术。假如东北现在的一百多万工人都成为熟练工人，那么，我们的生产就会搞的更好。现在全国土地改革快要完成了，我们很快就要建设许多新的工厂。但是，谁来设计工厂，谁来装置机器，谁来操纵机器，谁来领导与管理生产呢？我们如果没有技术，没有懂得技术的干部，则虽然有了资金，工厂也只好不办。因此大家必须认清：没有技术，没有科学，就无法发展工业，无法战胜敌人。当然，技术不和政治结合起来也是不能发挥其积极作用的。应该说：“重视技术是正确的，忽视政治是错误的。”不要把两者对立起来。我们的任务就是要使工人的技术更熟练；同时要进行政治教育，以巩固和进一步提高他们学习技术的热情。工厂中的政治、文化、技术各种教育应该很好地配合起来进行。做政治工作的人也要学技术。我们强调技术，而企业中的党、工会、青年团的干部和领导工业生产的上级机关干部却不懂技术，认为技术工作只是工人和技术人员的事，那是不对的。如果那样，就会妨碍我们的事业前进。
    第三件是工资福利工作。高岗同志说：政治和技术都很重要；但是如果我们天天讲技术，天天讲政治，不能在发展生产的基础上逐步地合理地改善职工的物质文化生活，也是不行的。我们必须做好工资、奖励和福利工作。我们要使被奖励者进一步钻研技术，未受奖励者积极研究、学习技术，争取受奖。为了贯彻按劳取酬的原则，现在要尽可能地推广计件工资制。我们应该使工人的工资随着生产的提高而有适当的提高。在实行计件工资时，要注意和照顾老技术工人，使他们的收入能够合理。如果忽略了这个问题，就要犯错误。我们要很好地鼓励他们，培养他们，发挥他们的作用，有计划地逐渐地把他们提拔到管理生产、指导生产的岗位上来。
    最后，高岗同志号召各级党、行政、工会、青年团的干部，以及技术人员和职员都深入到车间去。到车间去了解工人的思想情况、技术情况、劳动组织的情况、工人生活条件和劳动条件的情况。要深入地发现问题，具体地帮助解决。工人不懂得的要启发他们懂得，要善于引导他们从哪里使劲，使他们始终保持饱满的政治热情、劳动热情和学习技术的热情。工人的觉悟与技术提高了，生活改善了，就会给国家创造更多的财富，增产节约的任务也就会完成得更多和更好。
