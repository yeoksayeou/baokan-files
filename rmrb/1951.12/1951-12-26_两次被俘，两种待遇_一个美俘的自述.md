    Twice Captured, Two Kinds of Treatment
    —An American Prisoner's Autobiography
    John L. Dickson

    My name is John L. Dickson. My home address is 557 Harrison Street, San Jose, California. In school, I learned two trades—shoemaking and bread making. I left school when I was eighteen. I couldn't find a job in the trades I learned in school, so I became a farm worker. The wages I earned as a farm worker weren't enough to live on, so I decided to join the army, which was on May 1, 1941.

    After joining the army, I was shipped to the Philippine Islands in just a week. After six weeks of basic training, I was assigned to the Chemical Corps. I was in this corps when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Later, eighty Japanese transport ships carrying a large number of Japanese troops landed on Luzon Island. That night, we sailed in a large ship to the Bataan Peninsula. The Japanese troops attacking Bataan were much stronger than us, and a month after the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, we were forced to surrender.

    When we laid down our weapons, the Japanese soldiers came in and confiscated them. After that, the Japanese began to beat us, telling us to carry supplies for them. If we didn't, or if we were slow, we would be beaten, and some were even shot.

    On April 18, 1942, the Japanese marched us prisoners of war to a camp called O'Donnell in Tarlac Province. They made all of us march in four columns, which was the Bataan Death March. Many of us prisoners suffered from dysentery, and many others had malaria. During the march, we had no food or water. Many of us fell to the ground, and the Japanese guards kicked them fiercely. When the prisoners saw muddy water by the roadside, some of them stepped out of the line to scoop up the muddy water with their hands to drink. The Japanese guards either shot them or stabbed them to death with bayonets. An American colonel was walking behind me, very weak and sick, and other prisoners were supporting him. After a while, the prisoners supporting him could no longer support him, and one of them said, "I'm sorry, Colonel, if we continue to support you, we won't be able to march. We have to leave you here." The colonel's face turned very pale. They left him lying by the roadside. When I looked back at where he was lying, I saw a Japanese soldier walk up and stab the colonel to death with a bayonet. We continued marching forward.

    I myself suffered from malaria, fever, and dysentery, and was very ill. My left arm had been injured three days before being captured and was still throbbing. I walked blankly under the scorching sun, not knowing when I would die. At that moment, I began to pray to God to protect me during this march. As we walked on this road of death, many people were so thirsty that their tongues swelled up and stuck out of their mouths, but they were forced to continue walking by the Japanese soldiers, and those who couldn't walk only had death as their fate.

    We walked for six days and finally arrived at San Fernando City, where the Japanese had some trucks. They decided to let some of the wounded ride in the trucks. I was one of the lucky ones. I rode in a truck to Manila and was sent to prison. After we were sent to prison, we were divided into groups of ten. The Japanese told us, "If one person out of the ten escapes from the group, the remaining nine will be shot or beheaded." Indeed, some people escaped, and those in the same group as the escapees were executed by the Japanese. When the escapees were caught, the Japanese forced us all to line up and watch the execution of the escapees.

    In this prison, we only ate two meals a day. The food was very thin porridge with very little salt. We received no medical care. Every day, fifty to a hundred people died due to lack of medical care and poor living conditions. Although the prisoners were sick, they still had to work. If they didn't work, the Japanese would beat them with sticks or even with gun butts, sometimes beating them to death. I stayed in this prison for three months and was later sent to the Cabanatuan POW camp, a hundred miles away. The situation in this POW camp was the same as in other POW camps; many people died for the same reasons as before.

    Two years later, the American army began a counter-offensive from Australia, approaching the Philippine Islands. The Japanese decided to send the prisoners to Japan. There were about two thousand prisoners with me. We were marched back to Manila and then forced into the hold of a cargo ship. On the ship, we only ate one meal a day, which was a rice ball with a little salt. On the ship, many people died and were thrown overboard to be food for the fish. After eight days of sailing, we were sent to Osaka, Japan. Then we were put on a train and taken to a city called Niigata. After we were taken off the train, we were sent to a small house. We each had a number. This number was written on our coats. From then on, they only called us by our numbers, not by our names. My number was four hundred and thirty. Here, they ordered us to line up, bare our shoulders and backs, and undergo a physical examination in the cold outdoors. The prisoners looked very pitiful, frighteningly thin, and everyone could count their own ribs. There was no medical equipment in the POW camp, and sick prisoners were carried to low sheds near the POW camp to wait silently for death. In the Niigata POW camp, we were forced to work for a large Japanese entrepreneur who owned a large coal mine and shipyard. Our bodies became weaker and weaker, and we couldn't work hard. So the Japanese guards came to beat us again; they forced us to push heavy coal carts. Our legs were very weak, and we couldn't push these coal carts. Some people collapsed on the ground and cried loudly. But the Japanese guards grabbed the prisoners who had collapsed on the ground and beat them, telling them to continue working.

    We lived in a warehouse, which was empty except for straw on the ground. We huddled together on the straw to keep warm with each other's body heat. At five o'clock in the morning, when the bell rang, we had to go outside to stand in line for roll call. The Japanese officer in the POW camp sometimes lectured the prisoners. He ordered everyone to line up and stand at attention to listen. He stood on a box and lectured the prisoners in English. When he spoke, he paid close attention to the movements of everyone in the prisoners. As long as one person moved a hand or didn't stand at attention, he would jump off the box and beat this person half to death because this person didn't pay attention to his speech. Once, when he was speaking, he asked us if we understood the meaning of prisoners of war. He said, "I know what you are all thinking. You think that prisoners of war are soldiers captured by the enemy." He continued, "You are wrong, prisoners of war are not like that; prisoners of war are walking dead." As soon as he finished speaking, he saw a prisoner in the front row move, so he jumped off his box, kicked the soldier to the ground in the snow, and took out his saber and killed the soldier. He said, "Whoever disobeys my orders, I will treat him like this!"

    We spent three and a half years of hell in the hands of the Japanese, two years of which were spent in the inhumane prisons of Japan. It was not until the autumn of 1945 that I was liberated and returned to my home in the United States. After returning to the United States, I continued to live the life of a soldier in the U.S. Army. In 1948, I was sent abroad again, this time to Okinawa. In September 1950, I was sent to Korea to participate in the so-called "police action." I was transferred to L Company, 3rd Battalion, 19th Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. As we advanced north, I saw the destruction of North Korean families and beautiful cities by the war, and I saw the American planes massacre civilians; these situations made me realize the reason for the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army. At this time, I began to realize that what we were conducting was not a "police action," but a full-scale war. After crossing the 38th parallel, I entered North Korea. We carried the war to the Chinese border, truly threatening China. If China invaded our neighboring country, Mexico, and bombed our cities on our border adjacent to Mexico, how would we react? We would certainly not tolerate this, and we would immediately take steps to eliminate the threat to our country. That is what the Chinese People's Volunteers did by participating in the war. They participated in the war to defend their country. When we advanced north of Pyongyang, we were forced to retreat to Kaesong, not far south of the 38th parallel, in front of the Chinese People's Volunteers. This was in December 1950.

    I was captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers on January 1, 1951. The process of my capture was as follows: On January 1, two companies of the Volunteers attacked our defense line. Another group of Volunteers went around to our rear and surrounded us. Our retreat order came at ten o'clock on the night of January 1. The order came too late because we had already been surrounded by the Volunteers. We tried to break out in order to join our own troops in the rear. However, we met the Volunteers face to face. This was the first time I had fought against the Chinese army, and I could see that they were proficient in tactics. They fought very bravely, just like the North Korean army. The bullets of the Volunteers flew over our heads, and the facts told us that it was useless to resist any longer. The only way out in front of us was to surrender. I threw my rifle on the ground and raised both hands. The Chinese People's Volunteers walked towards me. They said to us kindly in English, "Don't be afraid! The Volunteers treat prisoners well." Then, we were taken to a Korean village. The Volunteer soldiers took us into a warm room to sleep and gave us hot food to eat. Soon, they led us to start marching north to our current POW camp. Because the railway had been bombed by American planes and transportation on the highway was difficult, we had to walk. However, how different this march was from the Bataan Death March! We walked about ten or twelve miles a day, with breaks in between. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers told us: When prisoners lay down their weapons, the Volunteers do not kill prisoners of war. The facts are indeed like this. When some people had sore feet during the march, the Volunteers let them ride in ox carts. When I was captured, I often thought of what our American officers had told us before we were captured. They told us that if we were captured, we would either be killed or cruelly abused. Now, I have discovered that the Chinese are a very friendly, peace-loving people who have no malice towards us.

    We arrived at the rear POW camp on March 7, 1951, and I am living in this place now. As soon as we arrived at the camp, we received cotton coats and blankets. The food we eat is the best food that can be obtained under the current circumstances. I was greatly surprised that this remote mountainous area, which has no military value at all, has also been bombed by American planes. However, on the ruins bombed by our own planes, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people have built new houses for the prisoners of war to live in. Our environment is constantly improving, and the food we eat is getting better and better. We have pork, beef, eggs, fresh vegetables, potatoes, bread, apples, and other foods. In winter, the houses we live in are heated, and the rooms are warm.

    The sanitary conditions in the POW camp are very good, and toilets have been built for each team. Each team has its own club, which has many recreational items. There is also a library in the POW camp, with many books. Prisoners can do various sports, in addition to gymnastics, they can also play basketball and volleyball.

    The medical conditions in the POW camp are very good, with several Chinese doctors and many Korean nurses. There is also a hospital in the POW camp, where patients can be hospitalized, where they receive good medical care and good food. In addition, the POW camp also has a sanatorium, where patients who have just been discharged from the hospital or who are not seriously ill can go to recuperate, where they are taken care of by doctors every day. There is also a clinic in the POW camp, where people who are not feeling well can go to see the doctor on duty every day. The medical staff are always careful to prevent diseases and have given every prisoner three vaccinations in the summer. The medical staff is concerned about the health of the prisoners. They have done everything possible to ensure the health of the prisoners. I know that on several occasions some of our prisoners would have died if they had not had surgery, but they were saved by the doctors in the POW camp.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers who manage this POW camp encourage the prisoners to serve themselves. They helped the prisoners set up a committee to take care of the prisoners' lives. In this committee, there is a health committee member, responsible for health work; a sports committee member; a committee member who organizes concerts and entertainment; a committee member responsible for drama work, who regularly organizes drama performances; and a food committee member, responsible for collecting everyone's opinions on food. The members of this committee are representatives elected by the prisoners themselves.

    The people who manage the POW camp treat the prisoners very kindly. They work exceptionally hard, often working until late at night.

    From being captured twice, I received two completely different treatments: one was brutal, insulting, and abusive treatment of prisoners of war; like what Japanese imperialism did to me during World War II; the other is truly humanitarian and lenient treatment, which is the actual situation of the Chinese People's Volunteers treating prisoners of war.

    两次被俘，两种待遇
    ——一个美俘的自述
    约翰·L·狄克生
    我的名字叫约翰·L·狄克生。我家的住址是加利福尼亚州圣荷瑟城赫里生街五百五十七号。我在学校时学了两种手艺——补鞋和制面包。我在十八岁时离开学校。我找不到在学校里学的手艺方面的职业，因此，我就做了农场工人。我做农场工人所得的工资，不够维持生活，于是，我决定参加军队，当时是一九四一年五月一日。
    我参军以后，只过了一个星期，就被运到菲律宾群岛。经过六个星期的基本训练以后，我被派到化学兵团去服役。当日本轰炸珍珠港时，我正在这个兵团里。后来，八十艘日本运输舰载运了大批日本军队在吕宋岛登陆。当天晚上，我们乘一只大船驶往巴丹半岛。进攻巴丹的日本军队比我们强大得多，在仁牙因湾战斗结束以后一个月，我们被迫投降。
    当我们放下武器的时候，日本兵走进来收缴了我们的武器。以后，日本人就开始殴打我们，叫我们替他们搬运供应品。假若我们不干，或者干得慢一些，我们就要挨打，有的甚至还被枪毙。
    一九四二年四月十八日，日本人把我们这批战俘押送往丹辘省的一个名叫奥丹奈尔营的地方去，他们叫我们所有的人排成四路纵队前进，这就是巴丹死亡行军。在我们被俘的人当中，有许多人患痢疾，另外有许多人患疟疾。在行军中，我们没有饭吃，也没有水喝。我们有许多人跌倒在地上，日本卫兵就凶狠地用脚踢他们。当俘虏们看到路旁的泥水时，有些人就走出队伍去用手捧泥水喝，日本卫兵不是把他们枪毙，就是用刺刀把他们刺死。我后面走着一个美国上校，他的身体非常衰弱，而且生病，别的俘虏扶着他走。过了一会，扶他的俘虏不能再扶他走了，其中一个人说：“对不起，上校，如果我们再扶你走，我们就不能行军了。我们只好让你留在这里。”上校的面孔变得非常苍白。他们让他躺在路旁。我回头向他躺下的地方看时，看到一个日本士兵走上去，用刺刀把这个上校刺死了。我们仍然向前行军。
    我自己患疟疾、热病和痢疾，病得很厉害。我的左臂在被俘前三天负了伤，还隐隐作痛。我在烈日下木然走着，不知道自己什么时候会死去。这时我开始祷告上帝保佑我在这次行军中能够保住性命。当我们在这条死亡的道路上行走时，许多人因为渴得很厉害，舌头胀得很大，伸出嘴外，但是他们被日本兵押着只得仍然向前走，走不动的人只有死路一条。
    我们走了六天，最后到达圣斐南多城，日本人在这里有一些卡车。他们决定让一些伤员乘卡车。我是运气好的人当中的一个。我乘卡车到马尼拉，被送进监狱。我们被送进监狱后，每十个人被编成一个小组。日本人告诉我们说：“如果十个人中有一个人逃出小组，剩下的九个人就要被枪毙或砍头。”的确有人逃跑，和逃跑的人同一个小组里的人也就被日本人处决。当逃走的人被抓回来时，日本人就强迫我们大家排队去看处决逃跑的人。
    在这个监狱里，我们一天只吃两餐。食物是很稀的粥，加上很少一点盐粒。我们得不到任何医疗。每天有五十人到一百人因缺乏医疗和生活条件恶劣而丧命。俘虏们虽然生病，还得去做工，如果不做工，日本人就要用棍棒，甚至用枪托打他们，有时把他们打死。我在这个监狱里住了三个月，后来被送往一百哩外的加巴那统战俘营。这个战俘营的情况和其他战俘营一样；很多人由于和以前一样的原因而死去。
    两年以后，美国军队开始从澳大利亚发动反攻，迫近菲律宾群岛。日本人决定把俘虏送到日本去，和我在一起的俘虏约有两千人。我们又被押送到马尼拉，然后被押进一只货船的船舱里。我们在船上时一天只吃一餐，吃的是一个饭团加上一点盐粒。在船上，许多人死去就被抛出船外，葬身鱼腹。经过八天的航程，我们被送到日本大阪。接着又被装上火车，被押到一个名叫新潟的城市。我们被押下火车后，被送往一幢小屋子里。我们每人有一个号码。这种号码写在大衣上。从此，他们叫我们时只喊号码，而不喊我们的名字。我的号码是四百三十。在这里，他们命令我们排成队，光着肩背，在寒冷的室外受体格检查。俘虏们的样子非常可怜，瘦得怕人，每个人可以用手指数自己的肋骨。俘虏营里没有医疗设备，生病的俘虏被抬到俘虏营附近的矮棚里，默然待毙。我们在新潟俘虏营里被迫替一个拥有一个大煤厂和造船厂的日本大企业家做工。我们的身体愈来愈弱，不能下劲工作。于是日本卫兵又来打我们；他们强迫我们推很重的煤车。我们的腿非常衰弱，我们推不动这种煤车，有些人累倒在地上，放声大哭。但是日本卫兵却抓住累倒在地上的俘虏殴打，叫俘虏们继续工作。
    我们住的地方是一间仓库，房里除了地上的稻草以外，一无所有，我们就挤在稻草上，靠彼此的体温取暖。大清早五点钟铃声一响，我们就得到外面去站队听候点名。俘虏营中的日本长官有时给俘虏们训话。他命令大家排好队，立正听讲。他站在一个箱子上用英语对俘虏训话。他在讲话时很注意俘虏中每一个人的举动，只要有一个人动一动手，或者不是立正站着，他就跳下箱子把这个人打得半死，因为这个人不留心听他讲话。他有一次讲话时问我们懂不懂战俘的意义，他说：“我知道你们大家是怎样想的，你们以为战俘就是被敌军俘掳去的士兵。”他接着说：“你们错了，战俘不是这样的人；战俘是行尸走肉。”他刚讲完这番话，看到前排的一个战俘动了一动，他就跳下他的箱子，把这个士兵踢倒在雪地上，并拿出他的军刀把这个士兵砍死。他说：“谁不服从我的命令，我就这样对待他！”
    我们在日本人手里过了三年半的地狱生活，其中两年的时间消磨在日本的惨无人道的监狱里。直到一九四五年秋天，我才得到解放，回到美国我的家里。我回到美国以后，继续过美国陆军士兵的生活。一九四八年，我又被派到国外，这一次是到冲绳。一九五○年九月，我被派到朝鲜去参加所谓“警察行动”。我被调到第二十四步兵师第十九团第三营L连。在我们向北推进中，我看见北朝鲜人的家庭和美丽的城市遭到战争的破坏，我看见美国飞机屠杀平民的情形；这些情形使我认识了朝鲜人民军英勇作战的原因。这时，我开始认识到我们进行的不是“警察行动”，而是全面规模的战争。越过了三八线，我进入了北朝鲜。我们把战争进行到了中国边界，真正威胁着中国。如果中国侵犯我们的邻国——墨西哥，并轰炸我们和墨西哥毗邻的我们边界上的城市，我们会有什么反应呢？我们一定不会容忍这件事情，我们会立即采取步骤，消除对我们的祖国的威胁。中国人民志愿军参加作战所做的事情就是这样。他们参战是为了保卫他们的祖国。在我们进到平壤以北的时候，我们在中国人民志愿军面前被迫退到了在三八线以南不远的开城，这是一九五○年十二月间的事情。
    我是在一九五一年一月一日被中国人民志愿军俘掳的。我被俘的经过如下：一月一日，志愿军两个连进攻我们的防线。另一路志愿军抄到我们的后面，包围了我们。我们的撤退令是一月一日晚上十点钟发来的。命令来得太晚了，因为那时我们已被志愿军包围起来。我们试图杀出一条路来，以便和后方的我们自己的军队会合。但是，我们面对面地遇到了志愿军。这是我第一次和中国军队作战，我可以看出，他们精通战术。他们很英勇地作战，正如北朝鲜军队一样。志愿军的枪弹由我们头上飞过，事实告诉我们再作抵抗是没有用处的。我们面前唯一的道路是投降。我把我的步枪抛在地上，举起了我的双手。中国人民志愿军向我走来。他们和蔼地用英语对我们说：“不要害怕！志愿军宽待俘虏。”接着，我们被带到一个朝鲜村落中去，志愿军战士把我们带进一个温暖的房间睡觉，并且给我们热的食物吃。不久，他们带领我们开始北进，到了我们现在的俘虏营。因为铁路被美国飞机炸坏了，公路上运输又很困难；所以我们不得不步行。但是，这次步行和巴丹死亡行军是多么不同啊！我们一天大约走十哩或十二哩，中间还停下来休息。中国志愿军的战士们告诉我们：当俘虏放下武器的时候，志愿军是不杀害战俘的。事实确实是这样的。在行路时，有的人脚痛了，志愿军就让他们坐牛车。在我被俘时，我曾经多次想到被俘前我们美国的军官们告诉过我们的话。他们告诉我们，我们如果被俘，不是被杀害，就是受到残酷的虐待。现在，我发现了中国人是一个很友善的、爱好和平的民族，他们对我们没有恶意。
    我们是在一九五一年三月七日到达后方俘虏营的，我现在就是住在这个地方。在我们刚一到达营内的时候，我们就领到了棉大衣和毯子。我们吃的东西是在当前的情况下所可能获得的最好的食物。使我大为惊异的是，这个完全没有任何军事价值的偏僻的山区也遭到了美国飞机的轰炸。然而，就在我们自己的飞机所炸成的废墟上面，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民已经建立起新的房屋给战俘们居住。我们的环境不断改善，我们吃的东西越来越好，我们有猪肉、牛肉、鸡蛋、新鲜蔬菜、洋芋、面包、苹果和其他的食物。在冬天，我们住的屋子都生了火，室内热烘烘的。
    俘虏营里的卫生条件很不错，每个队都修建了厕所。每队都有自己的俱乐部，里面有许多娱乐用品。俘虏营内还有一个图书馆，有许多书籍。俘虏们可以作各种运动，除了体操以外还可以打篮球和排球。
    俘虏营中的医疗条件很好，有好几位中国医生，还有许多位朝鲜护士。俘虏营中还有一所医院，病人可以住院，在那里得到很好的医疗和很好的食物。另外俘虏营还有一个休养所，刚出医院的病人或是病得不严重的人可以到那里去休养，在那里每天有医生的照顾。俘虏营内还有一个诊疗所，身体不舒适的人每天可以到那里去请值班的医生看病。负责医务工作的人员永远是小心地注意预防病，在夏天给每一个俘虏都进行了三次预防种痘。医务人员所关心的就是俘虏们的健康问题。他们作了一切可能作到的事情来保障俘虏的健康。我知道有好几次我们有些俘虏如果不是动了手术就会死去，结果他们被俘虏营的医生救活了。
    管理这个战俘营的中国人民志愿军鼓励俘虏们自己为自己服务。他们帮助俘虏们成立了一个委员会负责料理俘虏们的生活。在这个委员会里有一个卫生委员，负责卫生工作；一个运动委员；一个组织音乐会和娱乐委员；一个负责戏剧工作的委员，定期组织演出戏剧；另外，还有一个伙食委员，负责搜集大家关于伙食方面的意见。这个委员会的委员都是俘虏们自己推选出来的代表。
    管理俘虏营的人员对待俘虏的态度都是非常和蔼的，他们异常辛苦地工作，时常工作到深夜。
    从两次被俘中，我受到了两种截然不同的待遇：一种是残暴、侮辱和虐待战俘；像第二次世界大战中日本帝国主义对待我所作的那样；另外一种是真正的人道主义的宽待，这就是中国人民志愿军对待战俘的实际情况。（新华社）
