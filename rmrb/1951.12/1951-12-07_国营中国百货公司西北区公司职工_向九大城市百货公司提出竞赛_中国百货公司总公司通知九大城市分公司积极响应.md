    Employees of the State-Operated China Department Store Northwest District Company
    Propose Competition to Nine Major City Department Stores
    China Department Store Head Office Notifies Nine Major City Branches to Actively Respond
    This year, the State-Operated China Department Store Northwest District Company reduced commodity circulation costs by 2.23% compared to the original plan in the second quarter, and by 4.51% compared to the original plan in the third quarter. Now, the company's employees have followed up by formulating a plan to save 770 million yuan in commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter, and have proposed a patriotic production increase and economy competition to state-operated department stores in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, and to state-operated trading companies in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang in the Northwest District. The main conditions of the competition are: First, reduce commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter by 1% compared to the third quarter, that is, save 770 million yuan. Second, resolutely implement the policy of vigorously promoting sales and stabilizing prices. Thoroughly clear and sell inventory and overcome the idea of only valuing "brand-name goods," to ensure the completion of the fourth quarter sales, procurement, and allocation tasks. Third, attach importance to political and professional studies, give play to the initiative and creativity of employees, improve work efficiency, and ensure the timely compilation of various plans and reports. Fourth, do a good job in currency management in the fourth quarter, ensuring that the accuracy of income and expenditure plans reaches more than 80%, and strive to achieve more than 80% of payments to private industrial and commercial enterprises via bank transfers. Fifth, complete asset liquidation by the middle of December. Sixth, pay attention to preventing special agents, theft, fire, and dampness to ensure that people's property is not lost.
    The original work foundation of the China Department Store Northwest District Company was relatively weak, and the staff did not have much experience. However, the company's administrative leadership has always paid attention to leveraging the patriotic enthusiasm of employees and carrying out labor competitions, thereby improving work efficiency and improving management methods. For example, employees of the company's affiliated branches and wholesale departments have created methods such as "door-to-door sales" and "telephone ordering," which greatly increased sales. Also, for example, the company's salespersons previously only valued "brand-name goods," but after education from the company's administrative leadership, they were able to actively promote new brand-name goods. From January to September this year, the company exceeded its sales targets every month. The company's operating and management costs have also decreased accordingly. In addition, the company's employees have also proposed many other methods to save commodity circulation costs, which have achieved great results after being adopted and implemented by the company's administrative leadership.
    The China Department Store Northwest District Company's plan to reduce commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter was formulated after summarizing the above-mentioned successful experiences. Before formulating the plan, the company's administrative leadership mobilized employees to formulate patriotic pledges for individuals and for each section and department, and after repeated discussions, proposed ways to save. Then, the company's administrative leadership referred to everyone's suggestions and summarized the company's past experiences in saving to formulate the company's fourth-quarter savings plan. Now, the company's employees are working hard with full confidence to put the competition conditions into practice.

    On November 29th, the China Department Store Head Office issued a notice calling on department stores in the nine major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing to actively participate in the patriotic labor competition proposed by employees of the China Department Store Northwest District Company. The notice pointed out that this competition movement initiated by the employees of the China Department Store Northwest District Company is not only the key to completing the fourth quarter's work tasks this year, but will also lay the foundation for state-operated department stores to save funds and reduce commodity circulation costs in 1952. The China Department Store Head Office expresses its full support for this and calls on the responsible comrades of the nine major city branches to work with the trade unions to actively mobilize employees to enthusiastically participate in this competition. The notice also stated that if department stores in major cities are prepared to accept the challenge, they are expected to formulate the conditions for accepting the challenge and report them directly to the Northwest District Department Store before December 5th, and also report them to the Head Office at the same time so that the Head Office can study the competition summary and award methods.

    国营中国百货公司西北区公司职工
    向九大城市百货公司提出竞赛
    中国百货公司总公司通知九大城市分公司积极响应
    国营中国百货公司西北区公司今年第二季度商品流转费用较原计划减低百分之二点二三，第三季度较原计划减低百分之四点五一。现在该公司职工接着又制订了第四季度节约商品流转费用七亿七千万元的计划，并向北京、天津、上海、南京、济南、青岛、汉口、广州、重庆等大城市国营百货公司和西北区陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆五省各国营贸易公司提出爱国增产节约竞赛。竞赛的主要条件是：一、第四季度商品流转费用比第三季度减低百分之一，即节约七亿七千万元。二、坚决贯彻大力推销的方针，稳定物价。彻底清理和推销仓库存货，克服只重视“名牌货”的思想，保证完成第四季度销货、采购、调拨任务。三、重视政治、业务学习，发挥职工的积极性和创造性，提高工作效率，保证按时编造各种计划、表报。四、做好第四季度货币管理工作，保证收支计划正确性达到百分之八十以上，对私营工商业支付争取做到百分之八十以上转帐。五、提前在十二月半做好清理资产工作。六、注意防特务、防盗、防火、防潮，保证人民财产不受损失。
    中国百货公司西北区公司原来的工作基础较弱，工作人员经验不多，但是，该公司行政领导方面经常注意发挥职工爱国热情，开展劳动竞赛，因此提高了工作效率，改善了经营方法。例如该公司所属各分、支公司批发部的职工，曾创造“上门求售” “电话购货”等办法，大大增加了销货额。又如该公司销货员过去只重视“名牌货”，经过公司行政领导方面教育以后，都能主动推销新牌子货。今年一月到九月，该公司每月都超额完成了销货任务。公司的经营管理费用也随之减低。此外，该公司职工还提出其他许多节约商品流转费用的方法，经公司行政领导方面采纳实施后，得到很大成绩。
    中国百货公司西北区公司第四季度减低商品流转费用的计划，就是在总结了上述各种成功经验之后制订的。在制订计划以前，该公司行政领导方面曾发动职工订出个人的和各股、各科的爱国公约，经过反复讨论，提出节约的办法。然后由公司行政领导方面参照大家提的意见，在节约方面总结全公司过去的经验，制订了全公司第四季度的节约计划。现在该公司职工正满怀信心地努力实践竞赛条件。

    中国百货公司总公司十一月二十九日发出通知，号召北京、天津、上海、南京、济南、青岛、汉口、广州、重庆九大城市百货公司积极参加中国百货公司西北区公司职工提出的爱国主义劳动竞赛。通知里指出：中国百货公司西北区公司职工发起的这一竞赛运动，不但是完成今年第四季度工作任务的关键，而且将打下一九五二年国营百货公司节约资金和减低商品流转费用的基础。中国百货公司总公司对此表示全力支持，并号召九大城市分公司的负责同志协同工会，积极发动职工，踊跃地参加这个竞赛。通知并称：各大城市百货公司如果准备应战的，希订出应战条件，除在十二月五日前直接复告西北区百货公司外，并须同时报告总公司，以便总公司研究竞赛总结和评奖办法。（新华社）
