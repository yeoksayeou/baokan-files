    The Slogan "Get Rich, Go Control the Huai" is Wrong
    Editor: On the walls of Wanglou and Mengzhuang villages, Shiqiao Township, Xiatang District, Lushan County, Henan Province, there are some slogans with no political significance, one of which is "Get Rich, Go Control the Huai." This slogan completely ignores the great significance of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River for the construction of the motherland, and simply fosters the idea of individual wealth among the peasants. This is wrong. In addition, there are also some meaningless or even wrong slogans written on the walls of Niangniangmiao Village, Sixth District. According to township cadre Meng Zhaoxin, these were written by local primary school teachers. Slogans are calls to action issued by the People's Government to the masses based on the central tasks of each period, and should not be compiled or written casually. Party committees and people's governments in various places should correct this chaotic phenomenon of arbitrarily compiling slogans. Zhao Zonghui

### “想发财、去治淮”的标语是错误的

    “想发财、去治淮”的标语是错误的
    编辑同志：河南省鲁山县下汤区石桥乡王楼、孟庄等村的墙壁上，写着一些没有政治意义的标语，其中之一是“想发财、去治淮”。这种口号完全忽略根治淮河对于祖国建设的重大意义，只是单纯助长了农民的个人发财的思想。这是错误的。另外六区娘娘庙村的墙壁上，也写着一些没有意义甚至是错误的标语。据乡干部孟兆信说，这是当地小学教员编写的。标语、口号是人民政府根据每一时期的中心任务，向人民群众发出的行动号召，不应随便编、随便写。各地党委、人民政府应纠正这种随便编写标语的混乱现象。    赵宗惠
