    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 10th: The subcommittee established by the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee to study the US, British, and French proposal on disarmament and the Soviet delegation's amendments to this proposal (stipulating the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments and armed forces) concluded its work on the 10th. The subcommittee's final meeting lasted more than four hours. Naifu, the chairman of the subcommittee, told reporters after the meeting that the subcommittee had concluded its work. He said that a memorandum he had drafted at the request of the subcommittee had been unanimously adopted by the committee.
    Naifu said that he would forward this memorandum to the chairman of the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee, along with a letter stating that the subcommittee requested that this memorandum be considered as its work report. He also said that the discussions in the subcommittee had apparently led to a broader agreement between the two sides on certain points in the Three-Power proposal and the Soviet amendments to it.

    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：联合国大会政治委员会为研究美、英、法三国关于裁减军备问题的提案以及苏联代表团对这个提案所提出的修正案（规定禁止原子武器与裁减军备和武装部队）而成立的小组委员会，在十日结束了工作。小组委员会的最后一次会议历时四小时以上。小组委员会主席纳孚在会后告诉新闻记者说：小组委员会已结束了它的工作，他说，他应小组委员会的要求而拟定的备忘录获得了该委员会的一致通过。
    纳孚说：他将把这个备忘录转交给联合国大会政治委员会主席，并附信一件，说明小组委员会要求把这个备忘录当作它的工作报告予以审议。他又说：小组委员会中的讨论，显然使双方就三国提案以及苏联对这个提案提出的修正案中的某些点取得了更广泛的协议。
