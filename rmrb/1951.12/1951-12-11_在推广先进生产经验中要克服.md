    Overcoming Complacency in Promoting Advanced Production Experience

    The lesson learned by the Beijing Xizhimen Railway Station in promoting the advanced work of the Li Xikui shunting team should be taken seriously by the administrative leaders of every factory and mine. After the Xizhimen Railway Station was awarded the title of "Model Station" under the Tianjin Railway Administration last year, the leading cadres became complacent and arrogant. When promoting advanced work experience, they blindly believed that "the work has a foundation" and "the cadres are strong." They did not consult with the Party, the Trade Union, or the Communist Youth League, did not conduct ideological mobilization, and did not conduct key experiments. They simply made a plan in the office and announced its full implementation. As a result, they took detours.

    This kind of pride and complacency is extremely harmful to the work. For a long time, they did not see the shortcomings of their own work. They thought they had a way to do things well without consulting the Party, the Trade Union, or the Communist Youth League. They believed that the Party branch secretary did not understand the business and that discussing it with him would not solve the problem. They did not regard the Trade Union as a mass organization of workers, but as a working agency of the administrative department. They only notified the Trade Union to handle matters after decisions were made, or even did not notify it at all. Therefore, in their work, they were separated from the leadership of the Party and separated from the masses. In an enterprise, if the administrative leadership does not rely on the Party organization, the workers will lose ideological guidance in the movement, and their production work will lack the supervision and guarantee of the Party. If the administrative leadership does not rely on the Trade Union, it will not be able to mobilize the masses. Any cadre who is separated from the leadership of the Party and separated from the workers is not a "strong" cadre, but a bad cadre. Because in this situation, they cannot do a good job, but only a bad job. If you really want to be "strong," you must first get rid of arrogance and rely on the Party and the masses. The lesson learned by the Xizhimen Railway Station in promoting the advanced work experience of the Li Xikui shunting team fully proves this point.

### 在推广先进生产经验中要克服

    在推广先进生产经验中要克服
    自满情绪
    北京西直门火车站在推广李锡奎调车组先进工作中的教训，应引起每一个厂矿企业行政领导干部的重视。西直门火车站去年获得天津铁路管理局所属的“模范站”的称号后，领导干部便产生了骄傲自满情绪。在推广先进工作经验时，他们盲目地认为“工作有基础”，“干部硬”，不和党、工会、青年团商量，不作思想动员，不作重点试验，只是在办公室里订了一个计划就宣布全面推广。结果，走了弯路。
    这种骄傲自满情绪对工作的危害性是十分严重的。他们长期地没有看见本身工作的缺点。他们自以为有办法，可以不和党、工会、青年团商量就能把事情办好。他们认为党支部书记不懂得业务，和他商量也不解决问题；他们没有把工会看做工人群众组织，而是把它看做行政部门的一个办事机构，事情决定了才通知工会去办，甚至不通知。因此，他们在工作中便脱离了党的领导，便脱离了群众。在一个企业里，行政领导方面不依靠党的组织，就会使工人群众在运动中失去思想领导，就使自己的生产工作缺少党的监督和保证；行政领导方面不依靠工会，便不能发动群众。任何一个干部脱离了党的领导、脱离了工人群众的时候，就都不是什么“硬”干部，而是坏干部。因为他们在这种情况下，不能把工作搞好，只能把工作搞坏。如果真要“硬”，就非先把骄气去掉好好依靠党和群众不可。西直门火车站在推广李锡奎调车组先进工作经验中的教训，充分证明了这一点。
