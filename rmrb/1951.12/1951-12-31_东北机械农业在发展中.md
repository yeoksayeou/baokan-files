    Northeast China's Mechanized Agriculture is Developing
       By our reporter Tian Liu
    (I)
    The weather has been particularly warm this year. Even in the dead of winter, the North Manchurian grasslands are still a golden expanse. The ground doesn't have as much snow as it usually does this time of year. While travelling across the grasslands, one often sees many patches of black earth that have been turned over. From a distance, they look like patches of wildfire burning on the golden prairie.
    This is the land of the Northeast China mechanized farms. In the past four years, thirty large-scale state-run mechanized farms and hundreds of farms using new agricultural implements have sprung up in the fertile, thousand-mile grasslands of northeastern China. This year, these farms are cultivating more than 173,600 hectares [1] of land. The rows of tall, neat, and beautiful buildings of the farms radiate a dazzling brilliance in the winter sun. Anyone who sees such beautiful farmsteads in this boundless grassland called "Beida Huang" (Great Northern Wilderness) will be overjoyed.
    When I visited the North Manchurian grasslands in late December, the male and female workers of the mechanized farms were happily spending their winter farm life. Winter is the season for the farm workers to study. Each farm has established its own winter school. Each worker spends half a day studying new agricultural science knowledge and technology. After class, the farm workers immediately begin their winter tasks: tractor drivers carefully inspect their "iron horses"; women sit in warm, comfortable houses, chatting and carefully selecting seeds for next year. The evenings are the happiest time on the farm. The male and female workers gather in groups and go to their clubs, where they dance, sing, perform plays, and sometimes watch movies. The young prairie builders are full of ideals and long for the future. On snowy nights or quiet winter evenings, many young people huddle together, listening to the sound of the wind outside or watching the afterglow of the setting sun, talking about the future of the grasslands. Think of yesterday – the desolate and lonely grasslands, look at today – the fertile land being rapidly developed, how can people not yearn for a beautiful tomorrow!
    Today, on this fertile grassland, thirty mechanized farms have enabled more than 88,000 hectares of fertile land to grow luxuriant soybeans, wheat, and many other grains; more than two thousand [2] new tractors, pulling various agricultural implements of all kinds, are developing and cultivating the fertile land of the motherland. The total construction area of the mechanized farms has exceeded 250,000 square meters, making beautiful new villages appear in the boundless "Great Northern Wilderness". Each farm has its own beautiful offices, comfortable workers' dormitories; various warehouses for storing grain, machinery, and fuel; clubs, libraries, bathhouses, barbershops, cooperatives, and health clinics; many farms even have their own primary schools, where the children of the staff enjoy free education; many farms also have their own power stations, and at night, the entire farm is brightly lit. Those brave soldiers who came to the farm from the People's Liberation Army four years ago, the workers and students from the cities, and the simple and hardworking peasants from the countryside have become stronger and smarter in the four years of collective prairie life. More than 3,000 people have become experienced leaders and management cadres in large-scale mechanized farms, and more than 2,000 people have become technical personnel and excellent tractor drivers and combine operators armed with advanced agricultural science and technology.
    Once new technology is mastered by new technical talents, it immediately creates new production miracles. This year, the crops on the mechanized farms in Northeast China, although they encountered more than fifty consecutive days of rain during the autumn harvest season, the fields were muddy, and the machines could not go to the ground to harvest, suffering heartbreaking losses. However, the crops that were harvested before the rain were more than 20% higher than those of the local farmers. The yield of wheat reached more than 1.2 tons per hectare. Such a high yield over a large area of thousands of hectares has never been seen in the history of agriculture in Northeast China. Comrade Chen Shifu, the operations section chief of the Tongbei Mechanized Farm, conducted a comparative survey during the wheat harvest: the average wheat field on the farm yielded 25% more per hectare than the highest yield of local farmers, and 60% more than the average yield of farmers. The net profit per hectare of wheat field on the farm was more than 6.1 million yuan, while the highest for farmers was 4.2 million yuan; that is to say, the land cultivated by machinery this year yielded one-third more wealth than the farmers. This surplus will increase as the farm's cultivation technology continues to improve. Director Gu Shaoxiong of the State-owned Farm Administration Bureau said with confidence: it is not too far off to produce two metric tons of wheat per hectare - there is no exaggeration in his words. The fact that mechanized agriculture in Northeast China has developed rapidly from nothing to something and from small to large has eloquently demonstrated everything.
        (II)
    In the winter of 1947, on a day of snow and wind, three strangers arrived at Zhao Guang Station. They got off the train, stored their simple luggage in a small shop at the station, and went into the wilderness. They searched and observed everywhere in the wilderness, from west to east and from east to west. Sometimes they squatted down and dug through the knee-deep snow, watching for a long time head to head, and sometimes they stood on high hills and looked around. "What are they looking for?" People curiously speculated: "In this desolate Beida Huang, they can't find anything but ice, snow, and wind."
    A few days later, a "strange story" spread among the villagers at Zhao Guang Station: "They are here to build a mechanized farm."
    This was really unexpected. Although during the puppet Manchukuo period, the Japanese devils had a "development group" here, the laborers who were captured tried their best to escape the enemy's servitude; therefore, no decent crops had ever grown here. After August 15th, no one went there anymore, and the land was overgrown with weeds half a person tall; when the enemy fled, they destroyed the "development group's" residence beyond recognition: the house was like a stage set, it still looked like something from a distance, but a closer look revealed only a solitary wall, without doors, windows, or a roof. These three people seemed not to see these difficulties and continued to search and observe everywhere in the wilderness. A few days later, more than a dozen workers and forty or fifty young students came from the city. The more people there were, the more lively the work became. They first went to the mountains to cut wood, and then cut weeds from far away to set up two "majiazi" [3] for people to live in. They dug ice and turned snow, searching for broken plows, broken shares, and broken agricultural implements left by the enemy from the deep snow, bit by bit....
    This is the situation when the first state-run mechanized farm in Northeast China—Tongbei Farm—began to be built.
    Building a farm on the frozen grassland is fraught with difficulties in the beginning, as can be imagined. The biggest difficulty was the lack of technology and knowledge of mechanized farming. During the first spring plowing—the spring plowing of 1948—everyone was anxious when faced with the brand-new Soviet tractors; they didn't know how to drive because they lacked technology. Several car drivers were considered the most skilled "technical workers". They could start the tractor, but they didn't know agricultural technology and knowledge, and they didn't know how to cultivate. Most of the others were students who had just been recruited from schools, who knew neither agriculture nor technology. Comrade Geng De, an outstanding tractor driver who attended the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Peasants and Soldiers in 1950 and is now the director of the Third Operations Area of Tongbei Farm, recalled the situation in the first two years after the farm was established: At that time, even the tractor could not be started; it was finally started with the help of automobile workers, but it stalled before it even reached the field. Oxen lie down, and two whips will make them get up; the tractor doesn't move, but there is nothing to do, and you have to find another car to tow it back. At that time, there were a total of seven tractors in Tongbei Farm, and on average, less than three were working at the same time - this was the common phenomenon at the time. Because they didn't understand machine production, they didn't buy seeders when they bought tractors, so they had to "open up wasteland by machine and sow seeds by hand." After the tractor plowed the land, people had to carry large gourds with seeds on their backs and scatter them all over the sky by hand. Because the seeds were scattered on the ground and could not enter the soil, flocks of geese and crows flew to eat the seeds. The people on the farm had to wage a "hard struggle" with the geese and crows. Tongbei Farm even set up a special goose-hunting team. At most, one person could catch four geese in a day.
    What kind of cultivation, what kind of harvest. That year's wheat on the farm was considered not to have come home. The millet and miscellaneous grains yielded only 500 kilograms per hectare. Tongbei Farm sowed 125 kilograms of wheat seeds per hectare, and only harvested 25 kilograms of wheat. The nearby farmers felt sorry when they saw the land on the farm and said, "Our fields have grass in the crops, and the farm has crops in the grass." This situation did not fundamentally change until 1949. The seedlings in the field were like scabies on a bald head, patchy and uneven. As for how to exert the power of the land and manage it reasonably, no one understood it at that time. In terms of the policy of building the farm, it was also to open up a piece of wasteland and build a house if a room was needed. As for what kind of farm to build, how large the scale, what to operate, and how the climate, wind direction, and rainfall directly related to agricultural production were, had not yet been put on the agenda. Because there was no experience, all problems had to be "taken one step at a time", "advancing from groping and groping from advancing". The Ning'an and Yong'an mechanized farms had "moved". Because after operating for more than half a year, it was discovered that the original locations of these two farms were not suitable for mechanical production at all, so they had to be abandoned and new farms established elsewhere.
        (III)
    The first two years of the creation of mechanized agriculture in Northeast China were indeed a failure in terms of the farm's own production. Many machines suffered undue wear and tear, a lot of money was wasted, and the harvested grains were lower than those of nearby farmers. Many people raised the question of "whether mechanized agriculture in Northeast China has a future." These people wavered in the face of temporary difficulties. However, the policy of the Party and the People's Government was firm, pointing out that the initial difficulties were inevitable and could be overcome, and that mechanized agriculture must be done well to point out the direction for the liberated peasants. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government established the State-owned Farm Administration Bureau to strengthen the leadership of mechanized farms. All the cadres and workers engaged in the construction of mechanized agriculture, under the education and leadership of the Party, did not bow to difficulties. They received valuable training in the two years of practice, learned experience from failures, and obtained technology from machine damage and money consumption. In the winter of 1949, the State-owned Farm Administration Bureau successively held four professional meetings on technology, management, etc., to summarize the experience of building the farms in the past two years from all aspects. Each farm also took advantage of the winter production gap to conduct universal learning of agricultural science and technology among all employees, and made full preparations for the coming year's production: storing fuel, selecting seeds, repairing machines, etc., all were ready before the start of spring plowing.
    The year 1950 was a year of great change in the construction of mechanized agriculture in the Northeast, and the output of grain increased a lot. The yield of wheat per hectare at Heshan Farm was 914 kg, and at Tongbei Farm it was 900 kg, both of which increased by more than 80% compared to the previous year. The average wheat yield of each farm was 831 kg per hectare, exceeding the state quota by 18%. Those young people who came from schools and rural areas two years ago have become skilled tractor drivers. They are no longer troubled by how to start the tractor, but are thinking about how to make their "iron horse" play a higher efficiency. The tractor drivers of each farm widely implemented "joint operations"; the phenomenon of "using a tractor as an ox," in which one tractor only carries one seeder or one disc harrow, has been eliminated. Instead, they pulled three or four seeders and five or six disc harrows. During spring sowing, more than 5,100 hectares of soybeans were sown in just ten days. Heshan Farm harvested 400 hectares of soybeans in one month in 1949; in 1950, it harvested 500 hectares of soybeans in just seven days. In the two years since the farm was first established, nearby farmers said to the tractor drivers, "You are a little faster than me, but it costs a lot, and the land is not as good as mine plowed with horses." Now the tractor drivers are actively learning advanced Soviet agricultural technology, and when opening up wasteland and plowing, they bring small plows and disc coulters on the plow. After implementing the new tillage method, the plowed land is loose and flat, and even the newly opened raw wasteland can't find soil lumps the size of fists. The efficiency of the tractor has increased from 3 hectares per day to 6 or 7 hectares, and the fuel consumption has also decreased from 40 kg per hectare to less than 20 kg. Because the mechanical capacity was more highly utilized, each farm had surplus capacity to expand the cultivated area without increasing machinery. This year, each farm opened up more than 20,000 hectares of fallow land. In terms of management, each farm has also made significant progress. Each farm has divided its operation area, and started to carry out quota management and implement the contract system; established experimental areas, and started to carry out crop cultivation experiments; and started to attach importance to the registration, research, analysis, and investigation of climate, rainfall, wind direction, soil, etc. All this has made the construction of mechanized farms in Northeast China embark on the broad road of "improving technology, improving tillage quality, implementing crop rotation and fallow, and developing towards regularization" in 1951.
    The American imperialists' aggression against Korea angered all agricultural workers in the Northeast. The song "We planted every seedling with our own hands...Let's rise up to defend our motherland, and we will never let the enemy harm you even if we die" echoed in the North Manchurian grasslands. At the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951, many tractor drivers joined the Volunteer Army and went to Korea to fight. All the female tractor drivers of the first female tractor team in New China - the Liang Jun Tractor Team - shouted excitedly: "The motherland needs us, go to Korea to kill the enemy!" They asked the leaders to allow them to temporarily leave their beloved iron oxen and go to Korea to drive tanks. Those who were approved went bravely; those who remained on the farm turned their hatred for the enemy into the power of production. The patriotic bumper harvest competition initiated by Tongbei Farm quickly spread to all farms, and "improving technology, deep plowing and meticulous work, increasing yield, and reducing costs" became the specific actions and goals of every employee. Tractor drivers cleverly implemented "joint operations" and refitted "Stetzer" tractors to enable them to burn diesel to reduce costs. The farm's business management implemented cost accounting based on hectares. They universally implemented seed selection and disinfection, fertilization and inoculation (rhizobium); controlled sowing volume and mastered sowing depth; weeded before sowing and suppressed after sowing; implemented deep plowing, harrowing and leveling... a series of new farming methods. As a result, the crops of each mechanized farm generally grew well. This spring there was a continuous drought of forty days without rain, and the crops of the villagers were almost turning yellow due to the drought. Because the farm implemented deep plowing, the crops were still green. The wheat in the Heshan Farm was as tall as the chest, and the ears of wheat were like fingers, thick and fat, and a golden expanse. At this time, the villagers' wheat suffered from a very serious jaundice disease, and they realized that the farm's method of selecting seeds and disinfecting them and mixing them with copper sulfate was good. This year, in the wheat field cultivated by the Geng De Tractor Team of the Third Operations Area of Tongbei Farm, a 69-hectare wheat field yielded 3,000 kg per hectare, the wheat average yield of Wanggang Farm was 1,200 kg per hectare, the highest reached 1,600 kg, and the lowest also reached 1,000 kg, which was equal to the highest yield of local labor models. The average yield of wheat for local farmers is 800 kg; in comparison, the yield of the farm is 50% higher. Mechanized agriculture is like a rising sun, emitting a brilliant light stronger than ever, and deeply influencing and educating farmers.
        (IV)
    "The crops grown on the farm are better than ours" has become the general opinion of the local farmers. Farmers have asked to join state-run mechanized farms one after another. In Ning'an, Huanan, and other state-run farms, such things have happened. In Mengya Farm, there are already several such farmers. These farmers who have joined the state-run farms are now working freely and happily on the land of the state-run farms like other workers on the farm. Like other workers, they lead a free and happy new life.
    With the strengthening of the Party's communist education for farmers in rural areas, the vast number of farmers yearn for mechanized production and socialist society more eagerly. During the busy farming season of spring plowing and summer harvest, the farmers near the farm did not have time during the day, so they had to go to the roof at night to watch the tractors working at night. They watched the lights on the heads of the tractors floating in the night sky and cheered, "Look, it's coming over, hey, it's gone again, how fast!"
    When Wanggang Farm's wheat harvest was about to begin, the farmers nearby heard that the farm was going to use machines to harvest wheat, and they agreed with the farm long ago that they must come to visit at that time. A woman from Majiagou Village prepared a cloth bag and went to the farm's wheat field to pick up wheat. She thought, "The machine doesn't have eyes, and it doesn't know how much it will leave behind when it harvests wheat!" On the day of the harvest, more than 100 village cadres, Party members, labor models, and male and female farmers from the farm's vicinity came to visit. When the work started, the farmers were attracted by the "strange" movements of the combine harvester: the combine harvester advanced with a crunching sound, and more than 100 villagers also followed forward, watching with rapt attention as the machine swallowed the whole wheat plant with stems and ears, and then continuously spit out wheat grains from "that mouth", everyone was very surprised, and even forgot the discussions they had when they first came. The woman from Majiagou who was preparing to pick up wheat, like others, followed the combine harvester in a trance. After a while, she stopped as if she had suddenly realized and looked around for the dropped ears of wheat. She looked around but couldn't find any dropped wheat. Her face flushed, she spat and said, "It's like a tongue licking it, you can't pick up a single grain." Then she caught up with everyone to watch the combine harvester harvest wheat.
    After the combine harvester worked for an hour, the farmers calculated that the "Stalin No. 6" tractor combine harvested 1.98 hectares, and the "Stalin 4.0" automatic combine harvested 1.5 hectares. Liu Haijiang, a farmer from Shengli Village, said with admiration, "Oh my, how much work this saves!" The comrades of the farm then introduced the efficiency of machine planting to the villagers: This year, because the farm workers' technology has improved and they have widely and reasonably implemented joint operations, using "Stetzer" tractors to open up wasteland and cultivate land, it can reach 6 or 7 hectares a day, sowing 40 to 60 hectares a day, and harvesting wheat 15 to 20 hectares a day.... After hearing this, the farmers calculated their own cultivation efficiency: when opening up wasteland, two people and three horses use a new-style horse-drawn two-share plow to open up 1.2 hectares a day, and with an old-style plow, they can open up at most 0.8 hectares a day. A tractor can do enough for them to do in ten or eight days; sowing is even more "too far off." Three or four people, two or three horses, working hard, can only sow 15 mu a day, and the tractor is 40 to 60 times faster than manual labor; when calculating the combine harvester harvesting wheat, the farmers said, "It's simply incomparable, one is heaven, one is earth." For such dense wheat (the farm is cross-sown with a row spacing of 15 cm, with 4.5 million to 5 million plants per hectare), 15 people can harvest one qing (hectare) in a day with their heads down. After harvesting, at least one person and two horse-workers have to pull it home, and then three horses and two people can finish threshing. The farm uses a combine harvester, which harvests and threshes at the same time, and can load bags at that time, and can harvest 15 to 20 hectares a day. How many times has this efficiency been improved! Xin Lianshan, a farmer from Xinjabao Village, looked back at the combine harvester and muttered to himself as he walked home after the visit:
    "I used to say that socialism is good, but today I really saw the facts!"
    The mechanized farms in Northeast China have gone through a difficult and tortuous road in the past four years. It is a bright banner rising high on the fertile land of the motherland, among hundreds of millions of liberated peasants, guiding the way forward for agriculture in New China, and summoning the peasants to a happy tomorrow.

    东北机械农业在发展中
       本报记者  田流
    （一）
    今年的天气特别暖，虽然到了深冬，北满草原还是一片金黄。大地上没有像往年那样多的积雪。在草原上巡行，常常看到许多翻转来的黑色土地。远远望去，很像金色的草原上，燃烧着片片野火。
    这是东北机械农场的土地。最近四年中，在祖国东北部沃野千里的草原上，先后出现了三十个规模宏大的国营机械农场和数百个用新农具耕作的农场。这些农场，今年耕种着十七万三千六百多公顷〔一〕的土地。农场的一排排高大、整齐、漂亮的建筑，在冬日的阳光下，放射着炫耀的光辉。无论谁在这个被人叫作“北大荒”的茫无边际的草原上，看到这样美丽的田庄，都会欢欣得跳起来。
    十二月下旬，我去访问北满草原时，机械农场的男女工人，正在快乐地度过他们冬天的农场生活。冬天是农场工人们的学习季节。每个农场，都成立起自己的冬学。每个工人，每天有半天的时间，到冬学里学习新的农业科学知识和技术。功课完毕后，农场的工人们立刻去进行他们冬天的劳作：拖拉机手们仔细地检修自己的“钢铁的马”；妇女们坐在暖和舒适的房子里，一面说笑，一面精心地挑选明年的种子。夜晚是农场最快乐的时刻，男女工人们成群地走进自己的俱乐部，大家在一起尽情地跳舞、唱歌、演戏，有时也放映电影。年青的草原建设者是富于理想、向往将来的。在风雪呼啸的夜晚，或静静的冬日黄昏，许多年青人亲热地挤在一起，听着外面的风声，或者看着落日的余辉，尽情地谈论着草原的明天。想想昨天——荒凉寂寞的草原，看看今天——迅速地被开拓着的沃土，人们怎么能不向往美丽的明天呢！
    如今，在这沃野千里的草原上，三十个机械农场，使八万八千多公顷的肥沃的土地，生长出繁茂的大豆、麦子和许多别的谷物；二千多台〔二〕新式的拖拉机，拖着各种各样的、应有尽有的农具机，开拓着、耕种着祖国肥沃的土地。机械农场建筑的总面积，已超过二十五万平方公尺，使一望无际的“北大荒”，出现了美丽的新村。每个农场都有了自己漂亮的办公室、舒适的工人宿舍；有了储存粮食、机械、油料的各种仓库；有了俱乐部、图书馆、澡塘、理发馆、合作社和卫生所；有不少的农场更有了自己的小学校，职工子弟享受着免费的教育；不少农场，还有了自己的发电站，入夜，整个农场灯火辉煌。那些四年前从解放军部队中来到农场的英勇战士、从城市里来的工人和学生，从乡村来的朴实勤劳的农民，在四年的集体的草原生活中，变得更健壮、更聪明了。有三千多人已经成了大规模机械农场中经验丰富的领导者和管理干部，二千多人成了由先进的农业科学技术武装起来的技术人员和优秀的拖拉机手、康拜因手了。
    新的技术一旦被新的技术人材所掌握，就立刻创造了新的生产奇迹。今年东北机械农场的庄稼，虽然在秋收时节，遇到了连续五十多天的霪雨，田地泥泞，机器不能下地收割，遭受了让人痛心的损失，但是，雨前抢收回来的庄稼，产量都高出当地农民百分之二十以上。麦子每公顷的产量达一点二吨以上。数以千公顷计算的大面积作业，获得这样高的产量，在东北农业历史上是没有过的。通北机械农场作业科长陈士富同志，在麦收时，作过一次比较调查：农场普通麦田，每公顷比当地农民最高产量要高百分之二十五，比农民的平均产量高百分之六十。农场每公顷麦田的纯收益是六十一万多元，农民最高的是四十二万元；也就是说，用机械耕作的土地，今年比农民多收益三分之一的财富。这种高出的部分，是会随着农场耕作技术的继续提高而增长的。公营农场管理局顾绍雄局长满怀信心地说：使每公顷土地生产两公吨小麦，并不是太遥远的事情——他这话是没有丝毫夸张的。东北机械农业从无到有、从小到大地迅速发展的事实，已经雄辩地说明一切了。
        （二）
    一九四七年寒冬，一个漫天风雪的日子，赵光车站来了三个陌生的人。他们下了火车，把简单的行李存放在车站上的小店里，就到荒野里去了。他们在荒原上，从西到东，从东到西，到处寻找、观察。有时他们蹲下来挖开没膝的积雪，头碰头地观看好久，有时又站在高岗上向四处了望。“他们找寻什么呢？”人们好奇地猜测着：“在这荒凉的北大荒里，除了冰雪和风寒，他们什么也找不到。”
    不几天，赵光车站的老乡们，就传开了一件“奇闻”：“他们是来建立机械农场的。”
    这真是想不到的事。虽说在伪满时代，日本鬼子在这里闹过什么“开拓团”，可是那些被抓来的劳工，千方百计地逃避敌人的奴役；所以，这里从没有长出过像样的庄稼。“八一五”以后，再没人到那里去过，地里长满了半人高的荒草；敌人逃走时，把“开拓团”的住地破坏得一榻糊涂：那房子就像戏台上的布景，远远望去还像个样子，近前一瞧，只是孤零零的一堵墙，没有门窗也没有屋顶。这三个人好像没有看见这种种困难，还是在荒原上到处寻找、观察。几天后，又从城里来了十多个工人和四、五十个年青的学生。人越多，干得越热闹。他们先到山上伐来木头，又从老远的地方割来荒草，支起了两个住人的马架子〔三〕。他们刨冰翻雪，从深雪里东一片西一片地寻找敌人丢下的破犁、断铧、坏农具……。
    这是东北第一个国营机械农场——通北农场开始建场时的情形。
    在千里冰封的草原上建设农场，开始时要碰到许多困难，这是可以想像得到的。最大的困难是没有技术、不懂得机器耕作的知识。第一次春耕的时候——一九四八年春耕的时候，大家面对着苏联崭新的拖拉机发急；没有技术不会驾驶。几个汽车司机，就算最高明的“技术工人”了。他们能够把拖拉机开动起来，可是不懂农业技术和知识，不知道怎么耕种。别的人大都是刚从学校招来的学生，既不懂农业，也不懂技术。曾经出席一九五○年全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的优秀的拖拉机手耿德同志，现在是通北农场第三作业区主任，他回忆建场后最初两年的情形时说：当时，连拖拉机也发动不着；好容易在汽车工人帮助下开动了，还没走到田里，又灭火了。耕牛躺倒，抽它两鞭子就起来啦；拖拉机不动，却一点办法也没有，还得找另一台车把它拖回来。那时通北农场一共有七台拖拉机，平均起来没有三台同时工作——这是当时的普遍现象。因为不懂得机器生产，买拖拉机时没买播种机，只好“机器开荒、人工撒籽”。拖拉机耕出地来以后，还得用人背上拖着种籽的大葫芦，用手漫天撒。因为种子撒在地面，不能进到土里，大雁老鸦便成群地飞来吃种子。农场的人必须和大雁老鸦作“艰苦的斗争”。通北农场就专门设立了打雁队。最多的时候，一个人一天能捉住四只大雁。
    什么样的耕种，便有什么样的收获。这年农场的麦子，就算没有回家。稷子杂谷、一公顷只收五百公斤。通北农场每公顷小麦播下的种子是一百二十五公斤，收回来的麦子只有二十五公斤。附近的农民看到农场的土地，就痛惜地说：“我们地里是庄稼里有草，农场是草里有庄稼。”这种情况到一九四九年并没有基本变化。田里的禾苗就像癞痢头上的疮疤，东一片西一块的。至于怎样发挥地力、合理经营等等，在当时没有任何人懂得。在建设农场的方针上，也是有一片荒开一片地，需要一间房就盖一间屋。至于建立个怎样的农场，规模多大，经营什么，和农业生产直接有关的气候、风向、雨量如何，都还没有提到议程上来。因为没有经验，一切问题只好“走着瞧”，“从摸索中前进，从前进中摸索”。宁安、永安两个机械农场曾经“搬家”。因为经营了大半年以后，才发现这两个农场原来的地方，根本不适合机械生产，只好把它丢掉，再到别的地方建立新场。

    东北机械农业开创的最初两年，从农场生产的本身来说，的确是失败了。不少机器受到不应有的磨损，浪费了大量的金钱，收获的谷物比附近的农民的还低。不少的人发出“在东北机械农业是不是有前途”的疑问。这些人在暂时的困难面前动摇了。但党和人民政府的方针是坚定的，指出：初期的困难是不可避免的，也是能够克服的，一定要把机械农业办好，给解放了的农民指出方向。东北人民政府农林部设立了公营农场管理局，加强对机械农场的领导。从事机械农业建设的全体干部和职工，在党的教育领导下，没有向困难低头，他们在两年的实践中，受到了宝贵的锻炼，从失败中学到经验，从机器的坏损和金钱的耗费中，得到了技术。一九四九年冬季，公营农场管理局连续召开了技术、经理等四个专业会议，从各方面总结了建场两年的经验。各个农场也利用冬季生产空隙，在全体员工中普遍展开了农业科学技术的学习，并对来年的生产作了充分准备：储油料、选种子、修机器……都在春耕开始以前准备好了。
    一九五○年，是东北区机械农业建设上大转变的一年，谷物的产量提高了很多。鹤山农场每公顷麦子产量九百十四公斤，通北农场产九百公斤，都比前一年提高了百分之八十以上。各农场小麦的平均产量是每公顷八百三十一公斤，超过那年国家定额百分之十八。那些两年前从学校、农村来的青年，都成为熟练的拖拉机驾驶手了。他们已不再苦恼着怎样开动拖拉机，而是想着怎样使自己“钢铁的马”发挥更高的效率了。各农场的拖拉机手们，广泛地实行了“联结作业”；过去那种一台拖拉机只带一台播种机或一台圆盘耙的“拖拉机当牛使”的现象，已被消灭了。代之而起的是拉三台、四台播种机，拉五台、六台圆盘耙。春播时，五千一百多公顷的大豆，只十天就播种完了。鹤山农场一九四九年四百公顷大豆收割了一个月；一九五○年收割五百公顷大豆，只用了七天。在刚建场的两年间，附近农民向拖拉机手说：“你比我多少快些，可是花费大，地不如我用马耕的好。”现在拖拉机手们积极向苏联的先进农业技术学习，在开荒、耕地时，都在犁上带上小铧和圆切刀。实行了新耕作法后，翻出的地蓬松、平整，连刚开出的生荒地，也找不见拳头大小的土块了。拖拉机的效率从每天三公顷提高到六、七公顷，油料消耗也由每公顷四十公斤，减到二十公斤以下。因为更高地发挥了机械能力，使各农场在不增加机械的情况下，有了余力扩大耕地面积。这一年，各农场共开伏荒二万多公顷。在经营管理上，各场也有了显著的进步。各场都划分作业区，开始进行定额管理和贯彻合同制；建立起试验区，开始进行作物的培育试验；开始重视气候、雨量、风向以及土壤等的登记、研究和分析、调查工作。这一切，就使东北机械农场的建设，走上了一九五一年“改进技术，提高耕作质量、实行轮耕休闲，向正规化发展”的康庄大道。
    美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略，激怒了东北全体农业工人。“一棵禾苗我们亲手栽……起来保卫我们的祖国，宁死也不让敌人把你来侵害”的歌声，荡漾在北满草原。一九五○年底和一九五一年初，许多拖拉机手参加志愿军，到朝鲜作战。新中国第一个女拖拉机队——梁军拖拉机队的全体女拖拉机手们，激动地喊着：“祖国需要我们了，到朝鲜杀敌去！”她们要求领导方面允许她们暂时离开自己亲爱的铁牛，到朝鲜去驾驶坦克。被批准的奋勇前去；仍留在农场的人，把对敌人的仇恨，变成了生产的力量。通北农场发起的爱国主义丰产竞赛，迅速地在各个农场开展起来，“改进技术、深耕细作、提高产量、降低成本”，成为每一个职工的具体行动和奋斗目标。拖拉机手们巧妙地实行“联结作业”，改装“斯特兹”拖拉机，使它能燃用柴油，以减低成本。农场的经营管理上推行了以公顷为单位的成本核算。他们普遍实行选种消毒、施肥接种（根瘤菌）；控制播量、掌握播深；播前锄草、播后镇压；实行深耕、耙碎整平……一系列的新农耕法。结果，各个机械农场的庄稼，普遍地生育良好。今年春天连旱四十日未落雨，老乡的庄稼旱得都快发黄了，农场因为实行了深耕，庄稼仍然是绿油油的。鹤山农场的麦子高与胸齐，麦穗像手指头似的，又粗又胖，一片金黄。这时，老乡的麦子发生了很厉害的疸病，他们这才知道农场选种消毒、王铜拌种的办法好了。今年通北农场第三作业区耿德拖拉机队耕种的麦田中，一块六十九公顷的麦子，每公顷收获三千公斤，王岗农场的小麦平均每公顷产一千二百公斤，最高的达一千六百公斤，最低的也达一千公斤，和当地劳动模范的最高产量相等。当地农民的小麦平均产量是八百公斤；两相比较，农场的产量高出百分之五十。机械农业像升起的朝阳，一刻比一刻强烈地放射出灿烂的光辉，日益深刻地影响和教育着农民。

    “农场的庄稼长的就是比咱好”，已成为当地农民的普遍舆论了。农民们纷纷要求加入国营机械农场。在宁安、桦南和其他国营农场，都曾发生过这样的事情。在萌芽农场，已有好几户这样的农民了。这些加入了国营农场的农民，如今像农场中别的工人一样，自由愉快地劳动在国营农场的土地上。他们和别的工人一样，过着自由愉快的新的幸福生活。
    随着党在农村中对农民的共产主义教育的加强，广大农民对机械生产、对社会主义社会的向往更殷切了。春耕夏收的农忙季节，农场附近的农民，白天没有工夫，夜晚要到屋顶上，观看夜间工作的拖拉机。他们看着在夜空中浮荡着的拖拉机头上的灯光，欢呼着：“看看，过来啦，哎嗨，又过去啦，多快呀！”
    王岗农场附近的农民，麦收时听说农场要用机器割麦子，老早就和农场约定，到时候一定要来参观。马家沟村的一位妇女，准备下布袋，到农场的麦田里拣麦子。她想：“机器又没长着眼，割麦时还不知道要丢下多少呢！”收割的那天，农场附近的一百多位村干部、党员、劳动模范和男女农民来参观。作业开始，农民就被康拜因机的“奇特”动作吸引住了：康拜因轧轧前进，一百多位老乡也跟着前进，他们目不转睛地看着机器吞吃着连茎带穗的整棵小麦，又从“那个口口”川流不息地吐出麦粒，大家十分惊奇，甚至顾不上刚来时那样的纷纷议论了。马家沟那位准备拣麦子的妇女，和别人一样失神忘情地跟着康拜因前进。过了好一阵，她才省悟似的停下来，四下里寻找丢下的麦穗。到处转了会子，找不到丢下的麦子。她脸红红地啐了一口：“像舌头舐的一样，一颗粒也拣不着。”又撵上大伙看康拜因割麦子去了。
    康拜因机工作了一个钟头，农民们一算，那台
    “斯大林六号”拖拉康拜因，收割了一点九八公顷，“斯大林四·○”自动康拜因，收割了一点五公顷。胜利屯的农民刘海江“哎呀”了一声，赞羡地说：“这该省多少工啊！”农场的同志当时把机器种地的效率向老乡们介绍了一番：今年因为农场职工技术提高，广泛合理地实行联结作业，用“斯特兹”拖拉机开荒、耕地，一天达到六、七公顷，播种一天四十到六十公顷，收割麦子一天十五公顷到二十公顷……。农民们听过后，算了算自己的耕作效率：开荒时，两个人三匹马，用新式马拉二铧犁，一天开一点二公顷，用旧式犁，一天顶多能开上点八公顷，拖拉机一天干的够自己十天、八天干了；播种更“差老鼻子啦”。三、四个人，两三匹马，紧张工作，一天只能种十五亩，拖拉机比人工快四十到六十倍；计算到康拜因收割麦子时，农民们说：“简直不能比，一个天上，一个地下。”像这样密的麦子（农场是行距十五公分交叉播的，每公顷四百五十万棵到五百万棵。）十五个人闷着头割一天，才能割一垧（即公顷），割完了最少还得用一个人工两个马工把它拉回家，再用三匹马两个人才能打完场。农场用康拜因，连割连打，当时装袋，一天就能收十五到二十公顷，这效率提高了多少倍呀！辛家堡农民辛连山参观过后，往家走时，还三步一停两步一站地回头望着康拜因自语：
    “以前都说社会主义好，今天可真看见事实啦！”
    东北机械农场，四年来走过了艰难曲折的道路。它是在肥沃的祖国土地上、在亿万解放了的农民中，高高升起的一面鲜明的旗帜，指引着新中国农业的前进道路，召唤着农民走向幸福的明天。
