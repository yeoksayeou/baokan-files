The entire workforce of the Ma Liuhai, Zhao You, Liu Wuzong, Sheng Diancai, and Wang Zhande excavation teams of the State-owned Datong Coal Mine in Chahar Province, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and economy, have launched the "Ma Liuhai Excavation Team" labor competition movement in North China. They have proposed the following competition terms to the brother coal mine excavation teams of Jingxing, Yangquan, Jiaozuo, Fengfeng, and others: First, improve excavation efficiency. Starting from December 21st, in 1952, each round-the-clock shift (the three shifts rotating in a 24-hour period) should achieve a monthly excavation of 500 meters and ensure that the excavated roadways meet specifications. Second, strictly abide by labor discipline and safety regulations, continue to consolidate safe production, completely eliminate casualties, and ensure an attendance rate of over 95%. Third, coordinate with transportation workers to rationally organize the labor force, save materials, cherish tools, and reduce actual costs by 10% compared to planned costs. Fourth, strengthen political and cultural studies, overcome conservative thinking, promptly exchange and earnestly learn advanced experiences, and continuously improve class consciousness and technical skills. Fifth, hold team meetings on time, conduct criticism and self-criticism, strengthen team unity, and strengthen ties with transportation workers, technicians, and management personnel, uniting and helping each other.

Ma Liuhai, Zhao You, and the other five excavation teams are all advanced teams in this year's patriotic labor competition movement. Liu Wuzong's team changed the position of the blast-hole arrangement in July, which led to a monthly excavation progress of 412.24 meters. In November, Sheng Diancai's team created a "deep drilling, more explosives" drilling method, extending the drilling depth from 0.9 meters to 1.4 meters, which increased excavation efficiency by approximately 50% and saved a large amount of explosives and detonators. Zhao You's and Wang Zhande's teams absorbed advanced Soviet experience, organized work according to the cyclical production schedule, eliminated uneven workloads and "idling" phenomena, and achieved close coordination between excavation and transportation, leading to a steady monthly increase in excavation progress. Ma Liuhai's team, due to the rational organization of the labor force and the close unity of all workers, created the highest excavation record in the country. Currently, these five teams have taken action to achieve the competition terms. All teams have studied the deep-hole operation method of Sheng Diancai's team. The drilling depth of Ma Liuhai's team has been increased from 1 meter to 1.3 meters. The teams have also signed liaison contracts with transportation workers and collective guarantee contracts with administrative leaders. Some teams are supplementing and revising their patriotic covenants.

    国营大同煤矿五个掘进组
    发起“马六孩掘进队”劳动竞赛运动
    向井陉阳泉焦作峰峰等煤矿掘进组提出竞赛条件
    察哈尔省国营大同煤矿马六孩、赵有、刘五宗、盛殿才、王占德五个掘进组的全体工人，为响应毛主席提出的增产节约号召，在华北发起了“马六孩掘进队”劳动竞赛运动。他们向井陉、阳泉、焦作、峰峰等兄弟煤矿掘进组提出的竞赛条件如下：第一，提高掘进效率。自十二月二十一日起，在一九五二年内每个圆班（在一昼夜中轮流的三班）作到每月掘进五百公尺，并保证掘进巷道合乎规格。第二，严格遵守劳动纪律和保安规程，继续巩固安全生产，彻底消灭伤亡事故，保证出勤率在百分之九十五以上。第三，协同运搬工友合理组织劳动力，节省器材，爱护工具，使实际成本比计划成本降低百分之十。第四，加强政治、文化学习，克服保守思想，及时交流和认真学习先进经验，不断提高阶级觉悟和技术水平。第五，按时举行小组会，开展批评和自我批评，加强小组团结，并和运搬工友、技术人员、管理人员加强联系，团结互助。
    马六孩、赵有等五个掘进组都是今年爱国劳动竞赛运动中的先进小组。刘五宗组在七月份改变了炮眼排列的位置，使全月掘进进度达到了四百一十二点二四公尺。盛殿才组在十一月份创造“深打眼，多装药”的钻孔作业方法，将打眼深度由零点九公尺延深到一点四公尺，使掘进效率提高了约百分之五十，并节省了大量炮药和雷管。赵有和王占德两个组，吸取苏联先进经验，按循环生产时间表组织工作，消灭了工作忙闲不匀和“窝工”现象，作到了掘进与运搬之间的密切配合，使掘进进度逐月上升。马六孩组更由于合理地组织了劳动力和全组工人紧密团结，创造了全国掘进的最高纪录。目前，这五个组为实现竞赛条件，都已行动起来。各组都已学习了盛殿才组的深孔作业方法。马六孩组的打眼深度已由一公尺增加到一点三公尺。各组又和运搬工人签订了联系合同，和行政领导方面签订了集体保证合同。有些组正在补充和修订爱国公约。
