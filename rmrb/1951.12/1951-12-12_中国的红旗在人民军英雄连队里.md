China's Red Flag in the Heroic Company of the People's Army
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Pu

    On a heroic mountain ridge defended by a unit of the Korean People's Army at the front, a bright and striking red flag presented by the Chinese people flies high.
    In the past three months, the enemy has hardly stopped attacking this mountain ridge for a single day. Although they have lost more than ten thousand soldiers, they have consistently failed to occupy this majestic mountain.
    Whenever the valiant soldiers of the Korean People's Army repulse the enemy's attacks and inflict heavy casualties, they excitedly sing songs. They sing: "The red flag sent by Chongqing Women's Normal School inspires us to move forward; the 500 million Chinese people are connected to us by flesh and blood, we will surely be victorious!"
    This glorious red flag was brought to the front by the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea in April this year and presented to the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army. The flag was inscribed with words praising and encouraging the frontline soldiers for their heroic fight against the American aggressors, and it bore the signatures of more than one hundred teachers and students from the Chongqing Municipal Women's Normal School.
    The Eighth Company is a heroic company with outstanding battle achievements. In a battle in February this year, a squad of this company annihilated a company of the Li Seung-man bandit army's Third Division and captured ninety-eight prisoners alive. When the commanders and fighters of the company accepted this red flag presented by the Chinese people, they unanimously expressed their determination to respond to the noble friendship of the Chinese people and the teachers and students of Chongqing Municipal Women's Normal School with even more heroic combat actions. Many soldiers also copied down the names on the flag, preparing to write letters to thank them.
    This was on the eve of the second phase of the Fifth Campaign. The Eighth Company accepted a new combat mission the next day—to penetrate behind enemy lines and cut off their retreat.
    The red flag was held high by a model soldier, walking at the front of the队伍。Comrades from the fraternal units advancing side by side looked at this glorious banner with envy and admiration.
    On May 22nd, the Eighth Company arrived at its destination seven kilometers west of Gangneung. At dawn, the company commander led more than forty brave soldiers, braving the enemy's dense bullets, and rushed to a dangerous highland overgrown with vegetation beside the highway, controlling the enemy's escape route.
    The enemy concentrated three battalions, launching an attack on the Eighth Company under the cover of fierce artillery fire, desperately trying to break through and escape.
    The valiant soldiers of the Eighth Company defending the highlands engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The company commander and platoon leader were wounded, and Deputy Platoon Leader Yin Yingshi automatically came forward to replace the company commander in directing the battle. Once, more than two hundred enemies approached. Qian Jiyuan, the labor party branch committee member of the company (equivalent to the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary), raised the red flag and shouted: "All party members, all comrades! Look at this red flag! Five hundred million great Chinese people are with us, fight bravely for the motherland!" This sentence doubled the soldiers' courage to kill the enemy. The red flag fluttered in the smoke and rain of bullets, and grenades and machine gun bullets hit a group of enemies climbing up the mountain.
    A shell landed on the position, and Qian Jiyuan was wounded. Before he fell, Park Yong-seok, the deputy secretary of the labor party branch committee, stepped forward and took the red flag from his hand, allowing it to continue to flutter on the position. Soon, Park Yong-seok gloriously sacrificed himself, and Wen Minglu, the labor party group leader, immediately went up to take it over. This heroic red flag has always been proudly fluttering in the fierce battle.
    Inspired by the red flag, a wave of enemy troops was driven down; soon, another wave of enemies approached the position. Wen Minglu waved the red flag and shouted: "The time has come to avenge our compatriots and close comrades-in-arms, comrades, charge!" With the shout, the brave soldiers leaped up and pounced on the enemy. The wounded also joined the fierce bayonet fighting with submachine guns. The enemy collapsed in this unstoppable attack.
    In the lull of the battle, Wen Minglu automatically convened a party meeting of the labor party group leaders. He said: "Labor party members are unyielding, we must hold the position until the last person, we must not allow the enemy to escape." He pointed to the red flag and said solemnly: "This is the honor of our company, we must overcome difficulties and strive for victory!"
    Under the strong leadership of the labor party and the encouragement of the red flag, the valiant soldiers of the Eighth Company stubbornly repelled the enemy's charge after charge. Holding firm until three o'clock in the afternoon, the main force finally arrived. On this day, the valiant soldiers of the Eighth Company successfully completed the arduous task of cutting off the enemy's retreat; in twelve hours, they repelled eleven group charges by the enemy, killing and wounding more than two hundred enemies, and capturing three enemy prisoners.
    After this battle, the valiant soldiers of the Eighth Company wrote a letter to the teachers and students of Chongqing Municipal Women's Normal School in China, reporting their glorious victory and expressing their determination to continue to create even greater victories in future battles.

### 中国的红旗在人民军英雄连队里

    中国的红旗在人民军英雄连队里
    新华社记者　赵　普
    在前线朝鲜人民军某部守卫的一座英雄山岭上，飘扬着一面中国人民赠送的鲜艳夺目的大红旗。
    在最近的三个月中，敌人几乎没有一天停止过对这座山岭的攻击。他们虽然丧失了一万多个士兵的生命，却始终无法侵占这座雄伟的山岭。
    朝鲜人民军的勇士们每当击退了敌人的进攻和大量杀伤敌人之后，就兴奋地唱起歌来。他们唱道：“重庆女师送来的红旗，鼓舞着我们前进；五亿中国人民和我们血肉相连，我们一定能够胜利！”
    这面光辉的红旗，是今年四月间由中国人民赴朝慰问团带到前线献给朝鲜人民军某部第八连的。旗上写着赞扬和鼓励前方将士对美国侵略者英勇作战的话，并且有重庆市市立女子师范学校一百多个教师和学生的签名。
    第八连是个战功卓著的英雄连队。该连一个班在今年二月间的一次战斗中，曾歼灭了李承晚匪军第三师的一个连，活捉了九十八个俘虏。该连指挥员、战斗员接受这面中国人民赠送的红旗时，一致表示要用更加英勇的战斗行动来回答中国人民和重庆市市立女子师范学校师生的崇高友谊。许多战士还抄下旗上的名字，准备写信去感谢她们。
    这时正是第五次战役第二阶段战斗的前夜。第八连在第二天就接受了新的战斗任务——插到敌人后方去切断敌人的退路。
    红旗被一个模范战士高举着，走在队伍的前面。并肩前进的兄弟部队的同志们，都以羡慕和敬佩的眼光看着这面光辉的旗帜。
    五月二十二日，第八连到达了江陵以西七公里的目的地。这时天正破晓，连长率领四十多个勇士，冒着敌人密集的枪弹，冲上公路旁边一个草木丛生的险要高地，控制了敌人逃跑的道路。
    敌人集中了三个营的兵力，在猛烈炮火的掩护下向第八连发动攻击，拚命想夺路逃跑。
    守卫在高地上的第八连的勇士们和敌人展开了激烈的搏斗。连长和排长负伤了，副排长尹应实就自动出来代替连长指挥战斗。一次，二百多个敌人冲近了。该连劳动党支部委员长（相当于中国共产党的支部书记）千吉元高举起红旗喊道：“全体党员全体同志们！请看这面红旗吧！五万万伟大的中国人民和我们在一起，为祖国勇敢地战斗啊！”这句话加倍地提高了勇士们的杀敌勇气。红旗在硝烟弹雨中飘扬，手榴弹和机关枪弹猛烈地打在一群向山上爬来的敌人的身上。
    一颗炮弹落在阵地上，千吉元负了伤。当他还没有倒下去的时候，劳动党支部委员会副委员长朴容石挺身而出，接过他手中的红旗，使它继续飘扬在阵地上。不久，朴容石又光荣牺牲了，劳动党小组长文明律立即上去将它接过来。这面英雄的红旗始终在酷烈的战斗中骄傲地飘扬着。
    在红旗的鼓舞下，一股敌军被打下去了；不久，又一股敌人迫近了阵地。文明律扬着红旗喊道：“为我们的同胞和亲密的战友报仇的时候到啦，同志们冲啊！”随着喊声，勇士们一齐跃起向敌人猛扑过去。负伤的人也端着冲锋枪加入到激烈的白刃战中去。敌人在这一锐不可当的出击中溃败了。
    在战斗间隙中，文明律自动召集劳动党小组长们开了一个党的会议。他说：“劳动党员是不屈服的，打到最后一个人也要守住阵地，我们一定不许敌人逃跑。”他指着红旗郑重地说：“这是我连的荣誉，我们必须战胜困难，争取胜利！”
    在劳动党的坚强领导和红旗的鼓舞下，第八连的勇士们顽强地打退了一次又一次的敌人的冲锋。坚守到下午三时，主力部队终于赶到了。这天，第八连勇士们胜利地完成了切断敌人退路的艰巨任务；在十二小时内，打退了敌人十一次集团冲锋，毙伤敌人二百多名，俘掳敌人三名。
    在这次战斗过后，第八连的勇士们给中国重庆市市立女子师范学校的师生们写了一封信，报告他们的辉煌胜利，并表示决心在今后的战斗中继续创造更大的胜利。
