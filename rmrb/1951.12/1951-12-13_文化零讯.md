Cultural News in Brief

　　▲ The private Chang'an Bookstore in Xi'an is currently the only bookstore in Xi'an that publishes popular reading materials. The published materials are written in simple language, priced low, and the content mostly closely integrates with the political tasks of each period. The bookstore's publications also adopt various forms, including Qin腔 (Qin Opera), 快板 (clapper talk), 郿鄠 (Meihu, a type of local opera in Shaanxi), Yangko dance, folk tunes, and ballads. By the end of October, the bookstore had published more than 130 books and distributed more than 1.6 million copies.

　　Due to limitations in manpower and financial resources, the number of popular reading materials published by the bookstore can no longer meet the needs of the broad readership. Therefore, the Northwest Military and Political Committee Publishing Bureau has accepted the request of the person in charge of the bookstore to transform the bookstore into a joint public-private venture, and procedures are currently underway.

　　▲ The cartography group of the preparatory office of the Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences frequently conducts map reproduction work for map compilation. However, a type of purple map could not be reproduced in the past and had to be copied manually, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. Gao Fuxiang, who was responsible for the reproduction work, put his mind to it and recently created a method through multiple experiments that allows purple maps to be reproduced by photosensitive means, greatly shortening the time. In the past, it took half a month to copy one millionth-scale map sheet, but now several sheets can be reproduced in a day, saving considerable funds.

    ▲西安市私营长安书店是西安市目前唯一出版通俗读物的书店，出版的读物，文字通俗，定价低，内容大多能密切结合每一个时期的政治任务。该店出版物采用的形式也很多样，有秦腔、快板、郿鄠（陕西的一种地方戏）、秧歌、小调、歌谣等。到十月底止，该店已出版书籍一百三十多种，发行一百六十多万册。
    由于人力、财力的限制，该店的通俗读物出版数量已不能满足广大读者的需要。因此，西北军政委员会出版局已接受该店负责人的要求，把该店改为公私合营的书店，目前正在办理手续中。
    ▲科学院地理研究所筹备处制图组为编制地图，经常进行地图复照工作。但有一种紫色地图过去无法复照，必须经过手工抄写，既费时间且不易正确。担任复照工作的郜福祥为此开动脑筋，经多次试验于最近创造了一种方法，使紫色地图可以感光复照，而时间又大为缩短。过去抄一张百万分之一大小的图幅，需要半个月的工夫，现在一天就可复照几张，节省了不少的经费。
