Introducing "Defend Peace" Issue 5

The main articles in the fifth issue of "Defend Peace" magazine illustrate the strong resistance of the broad masses of people in various capitalist countries to the U.S. war preparation policy. In the editorial "On 'Preventive War'," the magazine's president, Pierre Cot, explains that war is not inevitable, but to avoid war, agreements must be reached through negotiations. Pietro Nenni points out in "Regarding the Moscow Economic Conference" that the U.S. government's obstinacy has deepened the contradictions among capitalist countries. Countries such as Britain and France can no longer tolerate the consequences of severing economic relations with the East, and recently Britain and the Soviet Union, and France and Poland have signed new trade agreements. The international economic conference to be held in Moscow at the end of this year will play a significant role in improving economic relations between the peoples of all countries. Other articles, such as "The British Trades Union Congress," "Belgium and the Netherlands Facing Crisis," "Swedish Doctors Will Not Be Accomplices," "The Italian People Firmly Oppose War Preparations," and "The Life of the Australian People in the Cold War," introduce the threat of war preparation policies to the lives of people in various countries and the resistance of people in various countries. This issue contains two articles about Iran, one being the opinion of former Mexican President Cárdenas on the nationalization of Iranian oil; the other introduces the tragic life of the people in Abadan, the Iranian oil production area. James Kemoe writes an article "Three Thousand Years of Chinese Art," introducing our country's glorious and brilliant art of various dynasties. In addition, there is the short story "The Newcomer," and some vivid texts introducing the peaceful lives of people in various countries. (Wu Xian)

    介绍“保卫和平”第五期
    “保卫和平”杂志第五期的几篇主要文章，说明了各资本主义国家广大人民对美国备战政策的强烈反抗。在社论“论‘预防战争’”里，该杂志社长皮尔·戈特说明战争不是不可避免的，但要避免战争就要从谈判中取得协议。彼得罗·南尼在“关于莫斯科经济会议”一文中指出，由于美国政府的一意孤行，已加深了各资本主义国家的矛盾。英、法等国对于东西经济关系断绝的后果已经忍受不了，最近英国和苏联，法国和波兰签订了新的商务协定。今年年底在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议，对于改善各国人民间的经济关系将起重大的作用。另有“英国的职工大会”、“比利时与荷兰面临危机”、“瑞典医师们不做帮凶”、“意大利人民坚决反对备战政策”、“冷战里的澳大利亚人民的生活”等文，分别介绍备战政策对各国人民生活的威胁和各国人民的反抗。本期刊有两篇关于伊朗的文章，一篇是前墨西哥共和国总统卡德纳斯对伊朗石油国有化问题的意见；另一篇介绍了伊朗石油产地阿巴丹人民的悲惨生活。詹·凯摩写了一篇“三千年来的中国艺术”，对我国光辉灿烂的各代艺术作了介绍。此外，还有短篇小说“新来的”，和一些介绍各国人民和平生活的生动文字。（吴岘）
