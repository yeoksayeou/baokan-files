    Continue to Oppose Bureaucracy, Oppose Corruption, Oppose Waste, and Strive to Launch a Production Increase and Economy Practice Movement
    Excerpts from Comrade Xi Zhongxun's Report at the Conference of Party Member Cadres of the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau
    On December 7th, Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau, delivered a report titled "Continue to Oppose Bureaucracy, Oppose Corruption, Oppose Waste, and Strive to Launch a Production Increase and Economy Practice Movement" at the Conference of Party Member Cadres of the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun called on all Party member cadres and non-Party cadres to take immediate action to respond to Chairman Mao's great call for production increase and economy practice. To launch this movement, we must first conduct a rectification movement with anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy as its main content. This is the central task of all cadres and the people of the whole country at present, and it is the biggest political problem we face. Only in the process of carrying out this movement, and on the ideological basis of carrying out this movement, can we effectively carry out the production increase and economy practice movement.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun first briefly analyzed the victorious situation of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the work situation of the whole country and the whole Northwest region, and pointed out that we have made greater progress, become more consolidated, and become stronger this year. We will take another big step forward next year, and all current work is to prepare for national construction and industrialization. Understanding these situations will enable us to deeply realize that Chairman Mao's instructions are completely correct and brilliant.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun then pointed out that, generally speaking, launching the production increase and economy practice movement means squeezing out manpower and money to strengthen national defense and economic construction. All Party comrades and all the people must understand that without heavy industry, there is no national defense; without national defense, the country has no strength and will be beaten by imperialism. Production increase and economy practice is the only broad road to squeeze out manpower and money for national construction. This is the effective method used by our great ally, the Soviet Union. Therefore, the policy of launching the production increase and economy practice movement is a policy to ensure the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, a policy to continue to maintain price stability and develop the economy, a policy to accumulate funds to accelerate national industrialization, a policy to promote and improve all aspects of work to make it more unified and rational, and a policy to establish a good atmosphere for the country and the people. In other words, this is a policy full of positive significance, and a basic policy of constant importance in our national construction. This policy must be implemented throughout the region, in all public and private sectors, and in all kinds of work. Leading organs at all levels must rely on the people to lead the people, especially relying on workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, to lead all strata. From the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau to the district and township people's governments and the district and township Communist Party organizations, lead by example at each level, supervise each other, send mutual inspections, put the public interest first and then the private interest, and make the public sector set an example, so as to widely and persistently launch the movement and make it a regular mass movement.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun made a profound criticism of some distortions and misunderstandings of the production increase and economy practice movement. He said: For example, some people think that the production increase and economy practice movement is a manifestation of our helplessness in the face of difficulties. This completely fails to see the positive significance of this movement and does not understand that production increase and economy practice is the basic policy of national construction and a major issue concerning the future of our country. Some people think that this movement is only a temporary crash campaign. This does not know that this is a policy of constant importance, and a basic policy for building New Democracy at present, and for building socialism and even communism in the future. Some people think that waste is less harmful than corruption; economy practice will hinder work and health, and streamlining and economy practice are only the business of financial and economic departments and have nothing to do with general Party and government organs; or they think that economy practice is only the business of public organs, and personal property does not have to be saved, and economy practice does not have to be promoted among the masses; or they think that economy practice is to reduce the living standards of staff members again – these understandings are incorrect and one-sided, and are misunderstandings. Economy practice is to ensure work and health, and first of all to ensure the lives of revolutionary staff members. Those who are overburdened and have difficult lives must be taken care of. In short, adjustments should be made according to the actual situation. Although production increase and economy practice focuses on financial and economic departments, it does not mean that there is no waste and corruption in general organs; the people must also practice economy, and personal "private property" must also be saved, so as to create an atmosphere of economy throughout the society. Finally, there is another saying that the Northwest is poor and there is no room for production increase and economy practice. This is actually a conservative view with a sense of complacency, and it is an extremely harmful idea. These incorrect understandings must be criticized and corrected, otherwise it will be impossible to launch the production increase and economy practice movement.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun explained in detail the direction and methods of carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement.
    In terms of developing industrial production, he emphasized: All public mines and factories must formulate production increase and economy practice plans on the basis of existing equipment and original production plans, and launch the production increase and economy practice movement. Private enterprises should also carry out this movement. In order to adapt to the new work situation, the people's governments and Party leading organs above the provincial level must quickly shift the focus of their work to urban and industrial construction, while taking into account rural work. The large administrative regions should shift now; the provinces can shift to next spring or summer depending on the progress of land reform, but they should start preparing now. The work of Party and government leading organs below the special district and county levels should still focus on developing agricultural production, while taking into account urban work. In fact, organizing rural production to serve urban industry is an indispensable part of national construction with the city as the center. If the city Party committees, such as the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, must have each member specifically assigned to lead and study how to do a good job in a factory, the current focus is on studying how to do a good job in democratic reform and develop production. Industrial leading departments at all levels must specifically study the production increase and economy practice plans of each factory one by one, and solve problems, in order to grasp the center and move forward steadily.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that since Chairman Mao issued the call, the masses in the Northwest have responded very enthusiastically. During the meeting of the Military and Political Committee alone, twenty-five industrial and mining enterprises wrote letters to the Military and Political Committee, proposing specific production increase and economy practice plans, proposing to increase production and save 57.6 billion yuan and 1,900 tons of grain within the year, and each unit is actively formulating comprehensive production increase and economy practice plans for next year. At present, this movement has begun to take off, but it is still in the initial stage and has not formed a broad mass movement with leadership and planning. Industrial and mining enterprises in the Northwest must make great efforts to carry out this movement, give play to the creativity of the working class, and tap the potential in industry. Efforts must be made in four areas: increasing production, reducing costs, saving working capital, and eliminating waste in capital construction. It can be asserted that production increase and economy practice will definitely promote the comprehensive reform of factories and mines, and make the work look brand new. The steps and methods of the movement can learn from the experience of the Northeast.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun particularly pointed out that Party committees at all levels must learn from the good experience that Comrade Wang Shitai, Director of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, has already explored in leading the construction of the Tianlan Railway. In general, the experience of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau is to rely on politics to lead technology. It was originally scheduled to open to traffic to Lanzhou in 1953, but after Comrade Wang Shitai grasped the key points, conducted in-depth inspections, personally went to investigate, and enlightened the workers, he was able to solve many engineering problems that technicians could not solve, and was able to propose the task of striving to open to traffic to Lanzhou next year. Comrade Wang Shitai is not an expert or engineer, but with Marxism-Leninism and the correct ideological style, he can lead technology and do a good job in capital construction. This shows that as long as the leaders are diligent in going deep into the lower levels, use their brains, and think of more ways, they can do things well. We have suffered losses in the past because we did not use our brains and took many detours. Anyone who does not work hard to study because they do not have technology or do not understand the business is a backward manifestation. To these comrades, the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau and Comrade Wang Shitai are good examples to learn from.
    In terms of industrial production, we must also attach importance to resource exploration. We do not fully understand how many resources and treasures the Northwest has. We must avoid blindness, especially to develop the production of oil, coal, and iron, and lay the foundation for large-scale economic construction, we must do a good job in resource exploration.
    In terms of developing agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry, Comrade Xi Zhongxun emphasized that the focus of developing agricultural production is grain production. After the land reform, the production and living conditions of farmers have improved, and farmers want to eat better. The vast people in the pastoral areas of the Northwest who could not eat grain in the past also want to eat rice and flour. Therefore, the demand for grain has greatly increased. Clothes are only changed twice a year, but grain must be eaten every day of the year. In the vast rural areas where there is still scattered small-scale production, our grain will not be very abundant for a considerable period of time in the future. If there is a crop failure, it will be a problem. Anyone who ignores this will make a political mistake. Therefore, carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement in the vast rural areas mainly focuses on increasing the yield per unit area to increase grain production. At the same time, advocate careful calculation of daily life, oppose extravagance and waste, and invest the savings in production. Mutual aid teams are the road to organize and increase production to become rich, and they are also an effective organizational form to educate farmers and improve farmers. We must do a good job in promoting them. Animal husbandry in the Northwest accounts for half of the country's animal husbandry, so we should pay special attention to it. This is the reality of the Northwest. The animal husbandry work in the Northwest this year is not satisfactory compared with other work. Of course, there are many objective difficulties, but our efforts are also not enough. We must greatly improve the work of the animal husbandry sector in the future. According to the statistics of Ningxia Province alone this year, a total of 300,000 lambs were born throughout the year, but 290,000 sheep of all sizes died this year. What a great loss! The Northwest is also a region that has been fighting against deserts and droughts and floods for a long time. Cultivating and protecting forests is of great significance. However, the area of forests burned and cut down this year is equal to the area of newly cultivated forests this year. What a great waste and what a great loss! Comrade Xi Zhongxun used these shocking figures to wake everyone up and pay attention to doing a good job in animal husbandry and forestry.
    In terms of financial and trade work, Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that financial and trade work should be combined with production and serve production. In managing currency and market management, we should sum up experience, correct shortcomings, think of more ways, and continue to stabilize prices, which is the most effective way to serve production. State-owned trade should vigorously support the development of cooperatives and organize the exchange of local products. This is an important and long-term task, and it is an important aspect of strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance and the worker-peasant alliance. We should constantly accumulate experience and improve our work. Financial work must be strengthened, and we must increase income and reduce expenditure. Reduce waste and reduce losses, and use what should be used reasonably, and resolutely do not use what should not be used or can be delayed; Party and government leading organs at all levels must carry out financial inspection work, oppose laying ambushes, organize financial inspection teams, clear up various financial grains, and disclose and criticize major cases found, and thoroughly deal with them.
    In terms of streamlining institutions and improving work efficiency, Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that we should implement the principle of rational adjustment, streamlining the upper levels, and strengthening the lower levels. Remove unreasonable phenomena such as overlapping, bloated, and excessive levels in the organization. We should simplify handling procedures, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of staff members, and improve work efficiency. This is an important part of the streamlining and economy practice movement of Party and government organs. We must reduce levels, reduce support staff, and implement fixed staffing and quotas. Streamlining is not to reduce work, but to strengthen work. We must recognize that we cannot reduce work because there are fewer people. We must promote democracy and make cadres think of more ways, and we can do things well even if there are few people and many things. Aren't those phenomena of "document travel", layer-by-layer approval, and extremely low efficiency very common now? There are cases of answering telegrams two weeks late, pushing up and down, and not being responsible for solving problems; some responsible cadres like to take care of small things, don't think about big things, and delay a lot of work.
    After streamlining, we must successively transfer cadres to strengthen economic construction departments. Areas where land reform has been completed must systematically transfer a group of backbones. We must make up our minds and prepare early, otherwise we will make mistakes.
    In addition, in addition to strengthening the financial management of institutions, on the one hand, we must use money reasonably and use existing money for the most necessary undertakings, and on the other hand, we must save expenses and advocate doing the most with the least amount of money. In general organs, we must strive to save on office expenses. Stop building and buying housing. Here, we must especially emphasize streamlining meetings, and professional meetings should not be held too often. In the past, we held too many, too large, and too long meetings. In the future, we must emphasize holding prepared meetings and holding meetings that can solve problems. We are not against holding meetings, but against unprepared and unresolved meeting methods. We must also advocate personal economy practice, which can also accumulate small amounts into large amounts. We must advocate cherishing public property and saving private property. All national property belongs to the people, that is, to the revolutionary cadres themselves, and must be cherished. It is also wrong to waste one's own private property. One's own property is also part of the country's total wealth. If one wastes it, the country's total property will be reduced.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun particularly pointed out that the most important thing we do today is people. As long as we have people, people with revolutionary thinking and revolutionary style, we can do things well even with less money, and we can do things even without money. We must use this proletarian ideology and communist ideology to educate cadres and educate the people, and overcome various non-proletarian ideologies. We must work hard in this regard. If we do not educate our cadres with this ideology, then the bourgeois ideology will invade our interior and corrode our cadres. Here, Comrade Xi Zhongxun particularly praised the great achievements and excellent style of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University. He reminded the responsible Party members of the cultural and educational departments to pay attention to: Our schools should be greatly developed, but today the country's financial resources cannot build and increase equipment in large quantities. We must be simple and frugal, and promote a hard-working and simple style. The Northwest People's Revolutionary University conducts educational work with very simple equipment and very little recurring expenses. They have no auditorium, classes are held in the open air, and there is no dining hall for meals, but the school leaders and students organize themselves to solve difficulties; in the past two years, they have trained more than 10,000 people and gained rich experience in transforming intellectuals. The method of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University is a method that must be greatly promoted in the vast majority of schools at present. Comrade Xi Zhongxun said that if people's ideological style is not good, they will ruin things even if they have money. Some people think that they cannot do things without money. These people do not know that the ability of our Communist Party lies in being able to work hard and overcome difficulties. This is our revolutionary fine tradition. Comrade Xi Zhongxun said: Did our Communist Party start a revolution after making a budget and having a certain amount of money? Didn't we come from the path of doing things without money, doing things with less money, and doing things well? In the future, we will have to start walking in this way in some aspects. We must explain this to the vast number of Party and non-Party comrades, and promote the glorious tradition of hard work and learn from the example of the Northwest People's Revolutionary University.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun said that only by doing the above work well can we prepare for the country's large-scale economic construction. However, in order to do the above work well, we must carry out a rectification movement against bureaucracy, anti-corruption, anti-waste, and carry out production increase and economy practice. Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that the phenomenon of waste in our work is alarming. Whether in national capital construction, in the storage of materials and grains, or in various undertakings, as long as it is checked, many serious waste phenomena will be found, especially in capital construction, where the waste is even greater. The Tianlan Railway project is the most obvious example.
    We must greatly carry out the anti-corruption struggle and expose corruption cases. Some people think that corruption is not serious in the Northwest. This is wrong. In fact, the situation in this regard is also very serious. At present, it is very necessary to carry out a thorough cleanup of the whole Party, thoroughly expose all large, medium, and small corruption cases, and deal with them separately. Only in this way can we stop the great danger that many Party members are being corroded by capitalist ideas. In addition, corrupt elements violate laws and discipline, degenerate and become corrupt, and seriously damage the Party's political influence. Guo Jinzhe, Director of the Public Security Bureau of Chunhua County, Shaanxi Province, shielded landlords, opened grain stores with private merchants, squandered millions of public funds when he got married, entertained more than 200 guests, received nine gift notes, and fired more than 100 shots. There are many such cases, even more serious than this. The constant occurrence of corruption cases is the Kuomintang style and bourgeois ideology that are eroding our body, and a considerable number of cadres are burying their future on the road of degeneration. This shows that there are still serious bureaucratic styles in the leadership work of Party and government organs at all levels. What we have here is irresponsibility, fear of using our brains, love of taking familiar paths, satisfaction with the status quo, only seeing the good and not the bad in the situation below, not abiding by discipline, lacking an overall concept, only thinking about our own units, seeking comfort, enjoying ourselves, and so on. Isn't this a serious bureaucratic style? Isn't this style already covering up those corruption and waste phenomena? It is precisely these phenomena that make our Party organization lose its combat effectiveness, and we must arouse the serious vigilance of the whole Party.
    All these situations show that although we conducted a rectification movement against bureaucracy and extravagance and waste last year, and achieved great results, we still need to conduct a rectification movement with anti-bureaucracy, anti-corruption, and anti-waste as the main content today to pave the way for carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement.
    This rectification should be carried out in a concentrated manner in a short period of time in all localities, and should not exceed one month at most. The time can generally be chosen between December this year and January next year, and should not be delayed any longer. The large administrative region level must start in the middle of this month in order to gain experience and guide all localities. In a short period of time, make a concentrated effort to solve outstanding problems and lay a good ideological foundation for next year's production increase and economy practice movement. This rectification must also be combined with the inspection and summary work of various localities and organs; in areas where Party rectification has begun in the organs, it must also be combined with Party rectification education to make it one of the important contents of Party rectification education.
    It is required that Party committees at all levels be responsible for making rectification the center of all work during the rectification period. Organize a rectification study committee with the participation of people from all walks of life in the People's Government organs. The head of the administrative department is responsible for the Party's organs, and absorbs key members to organize the leadership core. No matter which organ, the Party branch must devote all its efforts to carrying out the rectification work during the rectification period.
    The main method of this rectification movement is to carry out a democratic movement. The responsible cadres should combine the general spirit with the actual situation of the region and the organ, make a mobilization report to the cadre meeting, and designate the documents to be studied. Enlighten awareness, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, promote advantages, correct shortcomings, and solve outstanding problems, so as to improve the thinking of cadres, enforce national laws and discipline, improve work style, and promote work.
    The policy for corrupt elements in the rectification: those who voluntarily confess will be given leniency, and those who do not confess themselves and are reported will be given heavier punishment. The policy of education and transformation should be adopted for the majority of those who have minor corruption and show repentance, and severe punishment must be given to large corrupt elements who seriously damage national property.
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun emphasized at the end of his report: Rectification is a very intensive movement and is a work to transform ideological style. The leadership must grasp it very tightly. Organize strong backbones to grasp this movement and check frequently. Protect and support activists who dare to criticize bad phenomena and report corruption cases, and summarize and promote good experiences in a timely manner. Send strong cadres or work teams to departments or regions with more and larger problems to help.
    As long as we do this rectification movement well, our production increase and economy practice movement will surely be launched enthusiastically and intensively, and will develop persistently, and the tasks of production increase and economy practice we have put forward will be fully realized. Our work next year will take another big step forward on the basis of the present. (Originally published in Xi'an Mass Daily on December 11)

    继续反对官僚主义，反对贪污，反对浪费，为开展增产节约运动而斗争
    习仲勋同志在中共中央西北局党员干部大会上的报告摘要
    十二月七日，中共中央西北局书记习仲勋同志，向中共中央西北局召开的党员干部大会做了题为：“继续反对官僚主义，反对贪污，反对浪费，为开展增产节约运动而斗争”的报告。
    习仲勋同志号召全体党员干部与非党干部，立即行动起来，响应毛主席增产节约的伟大号召；为开展这一运动，必须首先进行一次以反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义为主要内容的整风运动。这是当前全体干部和全国人民的中心任务，是我们面临的一个最大的政治问题。只有在开展这个运动中间，在开展这个运动的思想基础上，才能很有成效地开展增产节约运动。
    习仲勋同志首先扼要地分析了抗美援朝的胜利形势、全国的和全西北地区的工作情况，指出：这一年来我们是更加进步了，更加巩固了，更加坚强了。明年将再前进一大步，现在的一切工作都是为了国家建设和工业化做准备。明白了这些情况，就可以深刻地认识到毛主席的指示是完全正确的英明的。
    习仲勋同志接着就指出：开展增产节约运动，总的来说就是要挤出人来，挤出钱来，加强国防建设和经济建设，全党同志和全体人民都须明白：没有重工业便没有国防，没有国防，国家便没有力量，便要挨帝国主义的打。增产节约是唯一的挤人挤钱出来建设国家的康庄大道。这是我们伟大盟邦苏联行之有效的办法。所以开展增产节约运动的方针，是保证抗美援朝斗争胜利的方针，是继续保持物价稳定、发展经济的方针，是积累资金加速国家工业化的方针，是推动和改进各方面工作使之更加统一，更加合理化的方针，是树立国家和人民良好风气的方针。也就是说：这是一个充满积极意义的方针，是我们国家建设中一个有经常重要性的基本政策。全区上下公私和各部门和各种工作中，都要贯彻这一方针。各级领导机关，必须依靠人民领导人民特别是依靠工人、农民和革命知识分子，带动各阶层。由西北军政委员会和中共中央西北局直到区乡人民政府和区乡共产党的组织，层层带头，互相监督，互派检查，先公后私，公家先做出榜样，以为表率，并广泛持久地开展起来，使之成为经常性的群众运动。
    习仲勋同志对于增产节约运动的一些曲解与误解，进行了深刻的批判。他说：比如有人认为增产节约运动，是我们碰到困难不得已的表现，这是完全看不到这个运动的积极意义，不了解增产节约是建设国家的基本方针，是关乎我国前途的重大问题。有人认为这个运动仅仅是临时性的突击运动，这是不知道这是一个有经常重要性的政策，在目前是为建设新民主主义、将来建设社会主义以至共产主义的基本政策，有人认为浪费比贪污危害性小；节约会妨碍工作、妨碍健康，精简节约只是财经部门的事，与一般党政机关无关；或认为节约光是公家机关的事，个人财产可以不必节约，群众中也不必提倡节约；或认为节约就是要把工作人员的生活水准再降低些——这些认识都是不正确的，都是片面的说法，是误解。节约是要保证工作和健康，首先要保证革命工作人员的生活，对其中负担过重生活困难者必须给予照顾。总之按实际情况加以调整。增产节约固然以财经部门为重点，但一般机关不是没有浪费和贪污现象；人民也要节约，个人的“私产”也要节约，要造成整个社会的节约风气。最后还有一种说法，认为西北地方穷，增产节约没来头，这其实是一种带有自满情绪的保守观点，是一种极端有害的思想。对于这些不正确的认识，都要给以批判和纠正，否则要开展增产节约运动是不可能的。
    习仲勋同志详细说明了开展增产节约运动的方向和办法。
    在发展工业生产方面，他着重指出：各公营矿、厂都要在现有设备及原生产计划的基础上制订增产节约的计划，开展增产节约运动。私营企业也要开展这个运动。为了适应新的工作情况，省以上的人民政府和党的领导机关必须将工作重心迅速地转到城市和工业建设方面来，并兼顾农村工作。大行政区现在就要转；各省则视土地改革进展的情况，可到明年春季或夏季再转，但现在就要开始作准备。专区及县以下党政领导机关的工作，则仍以发展农业生产为首要任务，同时，兼顾城市工作；实际上组织乡村生产为城市工业服务，就是以城市为重心的国家建设的必不可少的组成部分。城市党委如像西安市委，就必须每个委员都具体分工，每人领导和研究怎样搞好一个工厂，目前就是研究如何搞好民主改革，发展生产。各级工业领导部门，要对每一个工厂的增产节约计划，一个一个的加以具体研究，解决问题，才能掌握中心，稳步向前。
    习仲勋同志指出：自从毛主席发出号召后，西北群众是十分踊跃响应的，单在军政委员会开会期间，就有二十五个工矿企业单位给军政委员会写信，提出了具体的增产节约计划，共提出在年内增产节约人民币五百七十六亿，和粮食一千九百吨，各单位并在积极制订明年全面的增产节约计划。目前这个运动已经开始掀起，但还处在初期的状态，没有形成有领导有计划的广泛的群众运动。西北工矿企业必须用很大努力开展这个运动，发挥工人阶级的创造性，发掘工业中的潜在力。必须在增加生产，降低成本，节省流动资金和消灭基本建设中的浪费现象四个方面努力。增产节约，可以断言：一定能促进厂、矿企业的全面改革，并使工作面貌焕然一新。运动的步骤和办法可以多多学习东北的经验。
    习仲勋同志特别指出：各级党委必须学习西北铁路干线工程局局长王世泰同志领导修筑天兰路已经摸索出来的好的经验。总的说来，西北铁路干线工程局的经验就是要依靠政治来领导技术。本来预定一九五三年才能修通到兰州，但经过王世泰同志掌握重点，深入检查，亲自去摸，启发职工觉悟，就能解决了许多技术人员没法解决的工程问题，就能提出争取明年通车兰州的任务。王世泰同志并不是专家和工程师，但他有了马列主义，有正确的思想作风，就可领导技术，做好基本建设工作。由此可见，只要领导者勤于深入下层，开动脑筋机器，多想办法就可把事办好。我们过去就吃了不用脑筋的亏，走了许多弯路，谁要因为没有技术，不懂业务而不努力去钻研，就是一种落后的表现。对这些同志说，西北铁路干线工程局和王世泰同志是个很好的学习榜样。
    在工业生产方面，还要重视资源勘查工作。西北究竟有多少富源、宝藏，还没有完全了解，要避免盲目性，特别是要发展石油、煤、铁的生产，为大规模的经济建设打下基础，必须做好资源勘查工作。
    在发展农业、畜牧业和林业方面，习仲勋同志着重指出：发展农业生产的中心是粮食生产。土地改革以后，农民生产和生活条件都有改善，农民要求吃好些，西北畜牧区广大人民过去吃不上粮食的也都要吃米吃面了。因此，粮食需要量大大增加。衣服一年只换两季，但粮食却一年四季天天都要吃的。在广大农村仍然是分散的小生产的情况下，我们的粮食在今后相当长时期内还不会十分丰足，一遇歉收，就是问题。谁要忽视这点就要在政治上犯错误。因此，在广大农村中开展增产节约运动，主要是提高单位面积产量，以增产粮食为主。同时提倡精打细算过日月，反对铺张浪费，并以节约所得投入生产。互助组是组织起来增产致富的道路，又是教育农民提高农民的有效组织形式，必须大力搞好。西北畜牧业占全国畜牧业的半数，应特别重视，这是西北的实际。西北区今年的畜牧工作，比之其他工作，是做得不能令人满意的。固然客观上也有很多困难，但我们的努力也是不够的。今后必须大大改进畜牧部门的工作。今年单是宁夏省的统计，全年新生羊羔共三十几万只，但今年死去的大小羊只就是二十九万多，这是多大的损失！西北又是长期和沙漠和水旱灾作斗争的地区，培植和保护森林，有十分重要的意义。但今年烧毁和滥伐的森林面积就与今年新培植的森林面积相等，这又是多大的浪费，多大的损失！习仲勋同志用这些触目惊心的数字来惊醒大家，重视做好畜牧和森林工作。
    在财政贸易工作方面，习仲勋同志指出：金融贸易工作应与生产结合，为生产服务。在管理货币与市场管理方面，应总结经验，改正缺点，多想办法，继续稳定物价，就是最有效地为生产服务。国营贸易应大力扶助合作社的发展和组织土产交流，这是重要的长期的工作，是加强城乡互助与工农联盟的重要方面之一。应当不断地积累经验，改进工作。财政工作必须加强，要增加收入，减少支出。减少浪费，减少损失，该用的也要用得合理，不该用可缓用的坚决不用；各级党政领导机关必须开展财政检查工作，反对打埋伏，组织财政检查小组，清理各项财粮，检查出的重大案件要在报上披露，予以批判，彻底处理。
    在精简机构提高工作效能方面，习仲勋同志指出：应实行合理调整、精简上层、加强下层的原则。去掉组织上的重叠、臃肿、层次过多等不合理现象。应简化办事规程，发挥工作人员的积极性、创造性，提高工作效能，这是党政机关精简节约运动的重要内容。必须减少层次，减少勤杂人员，实行定员定额。精简不是减少工作，而是加强工作。必须认清，不能因人少，就减轻工作，要发扬民主，使干部多想办法，事多人少一样可办好。现在那些“公文旅行”，层层批办，效率极低的现象难道不很普遍吗？有回答电报迟到两星期的，推上推下，不负责解决；有些负责干部，爱管小事，不想大事，贻误了不少工作。
    精简过后，必须陆续抽调干部加强经济建设部门，已完成土地改革地区要有计划地抽调一批骨干，要下定决心，及早准备，否则就会犯错误。
    此外，除加强事业机关的财务管理工作外，一方面是要合理使用钱，将现有的钱用到最必需的事业上去，另方面便是节约开支，提倡以最小限度的钱，办最大限度的事。在一般机关中，机关生活办公费用必须力求节约。停止修建和购买住房。这里特别要着重精简会议，专业会议不宜开得过多。过去是开得过多、过大、过长了，今后一定要强调开有准备的会，开能解决问题的会，我们不是反对开会，而是反对无准备和不解决问题的开会方法。还要提倡个人节约，这也可积少成多。我们要提倡爱护公物，节用私物。国家一切财产都是人民的，也就是革命干部自己的，必须爱护。自己的私人财产浪费了，也不对，自己的财产也是国家总财富的一部分，自己浪费了，国家总的财产就减少了。
    习仲勋同志特别指出：今天我们做工作最主要的还是人，只要有了人，有了具备革命思想和革命作风的人，钱少也能把事办好，没钱也能办事。必须以这种无产阶级的思想、共产主义的思想去教育干部，教育人民，克服各种非无产阶级的思想。要在这方面下功夫。如果我们不以这种思想教育我们的干部，那末资产阶级的思想就会来侵袭我们内部，腐蚀我们的干部。在这里，习仲勋同志特别表扬了西北人民革命大学的巨大成绩和优良作风，他提醒文教部门的负责党员应注意：我们的学校应该大大发展，但今天国家财力不可能大量修建和增加设备，必须因陋就简，发扬艰苦朴素的作风。西北人民革命大学，在设备很简陋和很少经常费用的情况下进行教育工作的。他们没有礼堂，上课在露天，吃饭也没有饭堂，但学校领导与组织学生自己动手，解决困难；两年来训练了一万多人，取得了改造知识分子的丰富经验。西北人民革命大学的办法是目前在绝大多数学校中必须大大提倡的办法。习仲勋同志说，如果人的思想作风不好，有钱也会把事办坏。有人认为没钱办不了事。这些人不知道我们共产党的本事就在于能艰苦奋斗，克服困难，这是我们的革命的优良传统。习仲勋同志说：难道我们共产党干革命，是先做了预算，先有了多少钱才再来革命的吗？难道我们不是从没钱也办事、钱少也办事而且办得好的路子上走过来的吗？今后，我们在某些方面还要这样开步走的。对于这点，我们必须向广大党与非党的同志说明，要发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，学习西北人民革命大学的榜样。
    习仲勋同志说：只有做好以上工作，才能为国家的大规模经济建设做好准备。但是为了做好以上工作，就必须开展一个反对官僚主义、反对贪污、反对浪费、开展增产节约的整风运动。习仲勋同志指出：我们工作中的浪费现象是惊人的。不论在国家基本建设方面，在资材粮食保管方面，在各种事业工作方面，只要一经检查都会发现很多很严重的浪费现象，特别是在基本建设方面，其浪费更为巨大，天兰铁路工程就是最显明的例证。
    必须大大地开展反贪污斗争，检举贪污案件。有些人认为西北地区贪污不严重，这是错误的。实际上这方面的情况也是很严重的。目前开展一次全党的大清理，彻底揭露一切大中小贪污案件，分别处理，是十分必要的。也只有这样才能停止很多党员被资本主义思想所腐蚀的极大危险现象。此外贪污分子违法乱纪堕落腐化，严重地损害党的政治影响。陕西淳化县公安局长郭进哲包庇地主，与私商伙开粮店，结婚时挥霍公款数百万，待客二百余人，收礼帖九副，鸣枪百余发。此类事例，甚至比这个更严重的还有不少。贪污案件的不断发生，是国民党作风和资产阶级思想在侵蚀我们的肌体，相当数量的干部在蜕化的道路上葬送了自己的前程。这说明我们各级党政机关的领导工作中，仍然存在着严重的官僚主义作风。我们这里有的是不负责任，怕用脑子，爱走熟路，满足现状，对下边的情况光看见好的、看不见坏的，不守纪律，缺乏整体观念，只为本单位着想，图舒服、享受如此等等，这难道不是严重的官僚主义作风吗？这种作风，不是已经和正在给那些贪污、浪费现象作了掩护吗？正是这些现象，使我们党的组织失去战斗力，必须引起全党的严重的警惕。
    这一切情况，说明了：虽然我们去年曾进行了反官僚主义、反铺张浪费的整风运动，并得到了很大成效。但今天仍需要进行一次反官僚主义、反贪污反浪费为主要内容的整风运动，为开展增产节约运动开辟道路。
    这次整风，各地都应在短时期内集中力量进行，最多不超过一月。时间大体都可选择在今年十二月到明年一月之内，不可再迟。大行政区级必须在本月中旬开始，以便取得经验，指导各地。在短时期内，突击一下，把突出的问题解决了，为明年增产节约运动等打好思想基础。这次整风，还须结合各地各机关的检查工作、总结工作；在已开始在机关中整党的地区还要与整党教育相结合，使成为整党教育的重要内容之一。
    要求各级党委负责，在整风期内以整风为一切工作的中心。人民政府机关内组织有各方面人士参加的整风学习委员会。党的机关由行政首长负责，吸收骨干分子组织领导核心。不论那个机关，党的支部在整风期间必须全力进行整风工作。
    这次整风运动的主要方法是开展民主运动。由负责干部根据总的精神结合本地区、本机关的实际情况，向干部会议做动员报告，指定学习的文件。启发觉悟，发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，发扬优点，纠正缺点，解决突出问题，以提高干部思想，严肃国家法纪，改进作风，推动工作。
    整风中对贪污分子的政策：自动坦白者减轻处分，自己不坦白被检举后加重处分。对多数有轻微贪污行为有悔改表现者采取教育改造方针，对严重损害国家财产的大贪污分子必须给以严厉惩处。
    习仲勋同志于结束报告时强调指出：整风是个很紧张的运动，是改造思想作风的工作，领导上必须抓得很紧。组织强的骨干掌握这个运动，勤检查。对于敢于批评坏现象，检举贪污案件的积极分子给以保护和支持，好的经验及时总结推广，问题较多较大的部门或地区派强的干部或工作组去帮助。
    只要把这次整风运动搞好，我们的增产节约运动就必定能热烈地、紧张地开展起来，并持久地发展下去，我们提出的各项增产节约的任务就能完满地实现。我们明年的工作就从现在的基础上再前进一大步。（原载十二月十一日西安群众日报）
