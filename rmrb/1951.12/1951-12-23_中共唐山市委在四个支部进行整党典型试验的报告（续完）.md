     (V) Learning About Maintaining Close Ties with the Masses and the Exemplary Role of Party Members
    The purpose of studying these two lessons is to ensure that Party members understand and establish a correct relationship between the Party and the masses in their thinking and work. It is understood that some Party members are active in their work, have a good work style, are supported by the masses, and can motivate workers to complete tasks. However, the mass perspective of most Party members is not clear, they are not good at following the mass line in their work, and the relationship between the Party and the masses is not completely normal or close. For example, some masses react by saying: "If you offend that Party member, you'll suffer a loss; he'll report on us." Sometimes when the masses are talking together, they clam up when they see a Party member coming. As for individual Party members with bad work styles, their influence among the masses is very bad.
    Regarding the issue of Party members playing an exemplary role, many Party members only believe that "good production and hard work are the exemplary role of Party members," and they cannot promptly publicize the Party's policies and reflect the opinions of the masses. Some hold a "good old person" attitude, others try to stand out personally and exclude others, even affecting their production and work. Still others get a headache at the mere mention of "exemplary role."
    The study of these two issues—maintaining close ties with the masses and playing an exemplary role among the masses—should first explain the significance of Party members maintaining close ties with the masses and playing an exemplary role. Then, combined with the problems existing in their thinking and work, a brief analysis should be conducted to clarify right and wrong. Discussions should be linked to reality, and ideological and work-related self-examinations should be unfolded, emphasizing a frank and honest attitude, presenting both good and bad examples, and conducting analysis and criticism. Not only should the bad be criticized, but the good should also be affirmed, pointing out the direction. Experience has shown that, except for a few people whose spirit of self-criticism is poor, the general attitude is very good, and therefore many problems have been revealed. After criticism, they recognized that Party members must maintain close ties with the masses and play an exemplary role among the masses, uniting the masses to achieve victory. They also recognized the root causes of their mistakes and how to correct them. For example, some said: "In the past, I always thought the masses were too backward, believing that work tasks could not be completed without coercion. Now I realize that was wrong. The more we label the masses as backward and order them around, the less they will approach us, and we will become detached from the masses and isolated, which is very dangerous." A branch secretary said: "In the past, I once raised my hand to hit a troublemaking worker. At the time, I thought everyone knew he was bad, and hitting him would vent the anger of others. Now I realize that was wrong and illegal. I should have patiently persuaded and educated him." Some Party members confessed: "In the past, I was afraid of offending people, so I was always agreeable, agreeing with whatever people said, swaying with the wind. Now I realize that is not connecting with the masses, but rather lacking a stand, which is not the quality a Communist Party member should have." Some also confessed: "In the past, I just thought that good production and not slacking off was enough to fulfill the exemplary role of a Party member. Now I realize that's not enough. We must do all our work well, constantly listen to the opinions of the masses, report them to the organization, and publicize and explain the Party's policies to the masses at all times, truly playing a backbone role."
    After such study, work improved, and relations with the masses also improved. Some Party members were still looking for branch committee members and group leaders at 10 o'clock in the evening to discuss the Red May production competition plan and the Resist America, Aid Korea work. Alternate Party member Yan Botang, who used to be the most backward, found that there were not enough ash bags for the night shift after studying this time, fearing that it would delay production. He immediately found a worker and rushed to brush out 450 ash bags overnight, ensuring production and winning the support of the working masses and the praise of the trade union workshop committee. Alternate Party member Feng Litang, who used to be backward, has made great progress after this study. He actively sought out the production team leader to study the production plan and the propagandist to study the publicity work. Some workers said: "This Party rectification study has taken Party members a big step forward. After they finish their studies, leading us again will also take us a big step forward."

    (VI) Conducting Education on Loyalty and Honesty
    After studying the criteria for Party members, the ideological awareness of Party members greatly improved. They had a clearer and more specific understanding of how to be a Communist Party member. At the same time, in connection with reality, most Party members were able to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to expose and criticize the shortcomings and errors existing in their thinking and work. However, regarding historical and political issues, some only revealed a little, and some did not talk about them at all. This is because: on the one hand, the courses taught had little direct inspiration in this area, and on the other hand, they had certain concerns, mainly fearing punishment. In order to purify the Party organization, we believe that it is necessary to carry out an education on loyalty and honesty, focusing on clarifying history and launching a confession movement, and it is possible to achieve results.
    In carrying out the education on loyalty and honesty, it is necessary to explain that a Party member must dedicate himself to the cause of the Party—that is, the cause of the people—and must be loyal and honest to the Party. This is a precious quality of a Party member and one of the minimum conditions that a Party member should possess. Then, call on those who have concealed their history from the Party in the past to now honestly and loyally explain it to the Party, and explain that concealing it in the past because they did not know can be forgiven. Now that the Party has clarified it, they should explain it to the Party. If they continue to conceal it, it is a mistake on top of a mistake, and if problems are discovered at any time in the future, they will be considered disloyal to the Party.
    After the speech, let everyone think and combine with group discussions. Those who have no historical problems or have clarified their problems to the Party express happiness and ease; those who have concealed something feel pressured, and individuals who are unwilling to confess are depressed. Some avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, talking a little and holding back, watching the wind. Most people, however, experience intense inner struggles, showing restlessness, inability to eat or sleep; some cry bitterly, hating themselves; some reveal a little and then regret it. At this time, individual talks should be used to promote activists to enlighten and help everyone, and dispel concerns. In group discussions, attention should also be paid to ensuring that everyone talks about the issues on a voluntary basis, and phenomena such as forced confessions, labeling, and sarcasm should be corrected in a timely manner. This makes them dare to boldly expose their problems and conduct in-depth self-criticism. For example, Party member Lü Zenghui said: "My father used to be a puppet Baozhang [village head] and led the Kuomintang to conscript soldiers. I also took two guns from the factory. I didn't dare to talk about these things when I joined the Party and have been hiding them until now. I was afraid of being punished if I talked about them, but if I didn't, I would be disloyal to the Party. I thought I was wrong in the past, and if I continue to be wrong today, I would be even more sorry to the Party. Thinking of this, I had the courage to talk about it."
    The development of the movement was smooth and achieved great results. The problems confessed by Party members included ideological errors, improper work styles, and concealment of history. It was found that there was one person who was a despotic landlord and had served as an instructor for the Xinminhui, hindering land reform; one person who had joined our Party and then voluntarily left the Party; one person who had defected from the Party; four people who had participated in revolutionary work and then compromised; six people who had participated in the Kuomintang's reactionary organization "Industrial and Mining Party"; two people who had been puppet soldiers; seven people who had participated in reactionary secret societies; four people who had concealed their family background and social relations; and one person who had falsified their personal history.

    (VII) Conducting Party Member Registration
    After the education on how to be a Communist Party member, and after another review according to the Party member standards, Party member registration was announced. When mobilizing for registration, it was emphasized that each Party member should examine whether they meet the Party member standards, and whether those who do not meet the standards are determined to improve themselves to the Party member standards. Those who are not determined can not register. Registration or non-registration is entirely voluntary. Each Party member is required to consider carefully.
    After this announcement, everyone's thinking was very tense for two days. Some were reading the Party member standards carefully or measuring themselves against them during breaks or late at night; some were walking back and forth, considering restlessly; some were taking the initiative to ask for help, soliciting the opinions of others. Especially some backward Party members, who were not very attentive during the study, were now sharpening their knives at the last minute, copying the eight conditions of Party membership over and over again, writing them over and over again, very carefully. Due to the different progress of Party members, their center of consideration also varied. Some considered that their connection with the masses was not enough; some were worried that they could not keep up with the learning; but most Party members considered articles three, four, and five of the Party member standards. Because these are issues closely related to personal interests.
    Registration was conducted by people sent by the factory and mine Party committees. In terms of implementation methods: some branches had the host talk to Party members individually before registering, which was not a good method because it did not show the Party members' initiative; others had Party members voluntarily report to the organization that they wanted to register, and then talked individually at the registration office before signing. This method was very good, achieving that registration was voluntary, and also achieving that registering to be a Party member was a solemn and serious matter, not simply signing a name and finishing it. In the individual talks, the attitude of the vast majority of Party members was sincere and firm, they could humbly review their shortcomings and mistakes, and express their determination. For example, Party member Liu Guifu wrote when signing: "I resolutely implement the eight conditions of Party membership and answer the Party with practical actions." Party member Liu Fushan said: "In the past, I really let the Party down, acting like a veteran and separating myself from the masses. Now I am determined to overcome this. If I cannot overcome it, I ask the organization to give me severe punishment."
    In the individual talks, the focus was on the relatively backward and those who had not confessed thoroughly. They were asked in more detail. All those who were still unclear about the Party member standards and lacked determination were asked to consider it carefully before registering again. For example, Party member Sun Wantian repeated three times before finally deciding not to register. Two Party members considered for several days after the registration was announced before registering. Registration is voluntary and also an expression of the determination to be a Communist Party member who meets the standards, but it is not re-joining the Party, nor is it a screening according to the Party member standards, with those who do not meet the standards being purged. Therefore, checking according to the Party member standards during registration is to educate and improve Party members. Even those who do not currently meet the standards are allowed to register as long as they are determined.
    As a result of the registration, of the 114 people participating in the Party rectification, four did not register, mainly because personal interests could not be subordinated to the interests of the Party. After registration, the vast majority of Party members were relaxed and happy, but in everyone's discussions, they still reminded themselves from time to time and encouraged each other. Party member Guo Sigui said: "This registration tested me. Without the determination to fight for communism, you cannot be a Communist Party member." Another Party member said: "From now on, our branch must do a good job. Anyone who makes a mistake must be pointed out." Party member Yao Yongyi wrapped up the printed Party member standards and saved them for future self-examination. However, Party members with historical problems and serious mistakes were still depressed, worrying that they would not pass the appraisal.
    From this registration, we have the following points of experience:
    1. Experience has shown that after conducting education on the Party member standards during Party rectification, it is absolutely necessary to conduct a Party member registration under the principle of voluntariness. Registration has the following benefits: (1) It deepens everyone's understanding of the Party member standards. Everyone's reaction is: "This is more rewarding than studying in the Party training class for half a month." (2) After self-examination, it creates favorable conditions for appraisal and lays a better foundation for adhering to the Party member standards and consolidating the Party organization in the future. (3) Using the method of self-elimination, some elements who are still willing to be backward in the future are purged, improving the quality of the Party without hurting feelings.
    2. Party member registration is not re-joining the Party, nor is it the final organizational processing. Therefore, everyone should be accepted, but in order to make Party members who are not determined to be truly consciously willing to be a Party member who meets the standards, it is necessary to ask a few questions during registration. However, it must be recognized that there are also false resolutions, and some people, although they have expressed their determination, have not completely dispelled their concerns; others have various bad motives. Therefore, not all problems can be solved after registration.
    3. Registration is voluntary, and personal consideration is the main method, but it is not forbidden to exchange opinions with each other. In order to win over all possible elements for transformation, in personal consideration, it is absolutely necessary for the leadership to promote activists to help them understand the Party member standards, conduct self-examination, and dispel concerns.

    (VIII) Appraisal and Organizational Handling
    After registration, an appraisal is carried out.
    The appraisal is based on the Party member standards, checking which points you meet, which points you do not meet, and what your future direction of efforts is. The requirements of the appraisal are one step further than registration. The main thing in registration is that individuals check according to the Party member standards. Due to the limitations of the level of understanding and ideological concerns, individuals cannot have a deep and comprehensive understanding of themselves. The appraisal requires everyone to carry out criticism, to comprehensively and systematically understand a person, and on this basis of understanding, through the group's appraisal, for those who have problems that need to be organizationally handled, the group should first put forward opinions, which are submitted to the branch general meeting for discussion and decision.
    The appraisal is conducted on the basis of preparation and certain conditions. The so-called conditions are: (1) Everyone's awareness has improved, and everyone has a certain understanding of themselves after registration; (2) In the learning stage, everyone understands each other in connection with reality; (3) After the exercise of criticism and self-criticism, the general can master this weapon. The so-called preparation is: (1) The cadres leading the Party rectification have conducted necessary investigations of Party members in all aspects, and have a basic understanding of the vast majority of Party members; They have held meetings of activists, exchanged views on how to deal with backward elements and people with problems, so that they have a clear idea in their minds, so as to play a backbone role among Party members and the masses; (2) In order to closely connect the Party with the masses, materials have been widely collected, mass symposiums have been held, and the opinions of the masses on each Party member have been listened to; (3) The purpose and standards of the appraisal and the attitude that individuals should hold have been explained, so that everyone is ideologically prepared.
    The conduct of the appraisal is serious and conscientious, with criticism and self-criticism unfolded in a sincere attitude, without any phenomena of forced confessions. At the beginning, there was a tendency to only talk about shortcomings and not mention advantages. After correction, it can be done to conduct a comprehensive criticism of a person. Individual backward elements are confused in their thinking, and their self-examination is incoherent and irrelevant, and they cannot say anything. After everyone's help, they can recognize a few superficial advantages and disadvantages, but it is impossible to deeply and systematically understand themselves. A few people are not honest in their attitude, say backward things, stutter, and gloss over the facts; some play rascals, all of which have been exposed and strictly criticized in the appraisal.
    In the appraisal, the group puts forward opinions on whether to convert probationary Party members whose probationary period has expired to full membership, extend the probationary period, or cancel their qualifications as probationary Party members, based on their specific circumstances. For backward elements who cannot be educated and transformed, and bad elements who have mixed into the Party, the group also puts forward handling opinions, which are discussed and decided by the branch general meeting. Among the 114 people, the final handling results were: three probationary Party members converted to full membership, one probationary period extended, two probationary Party members' qualifications cancelled, three formal Party members voluntarily withdrew from the Party (they were backward elements), one persuaded to withdraw from the Party (they were backward elements), five expelled from the Party (one was a defector, two were puppet self-defense team leaders and perpetrators, one was the leader of the "Industrial and Mining Party" group, and one was a hooligan), two placed on probation within the Party, and six whose materials were incomplete and could not be finally processed.
    From the results of the appraisal, the Party organization has a new atmosphere after the Party rectification. In addition to the purging and voluntary withdrawal from the Party in the appraisal, among the 101 people: (1) 61 people who were consistently active in their work in the past, had few shortcomings, and made progress in the Party rectification; (2) 30 people who were backward or had many shortcomings in the past, had changed in the Party rectification, had greatly improved ideologically, and actively asked for progress; (3) 10 people who were ideologically backward in the past, had many shortcomings, had made little progress in the Party rectification, but still had a demand for progress.
    Regarding this appraisal and organizational handling, Party members and the masses have the following reactions:
    After the appraisal, everyone felt relaxed and happy, and generally expressed their determination to strive to be a Communist Party member who meets the standards! Some said: "The appraisal is like taking a bath." Some said: "In the past, I was a patient, and the appraisal cured me." Many people said: "We must help each other and measure ourselves against the Party member standards at all times to do a good job in the Party's work."
    After the organizational handling was done, some said: "This time the Party's face is brand new." Some said: "This way the Party will be purified." Some said: "This handling is very appropriate." Non-Party people said: "I attended the Party meeting that day, and I have a clearer understanding of the Party. The Kuomintang rewards people for beating and scolding people, but if Communist Party members take the Kuomintang's road, it won't work." "Communist Party members must be good, otherwise they cannot be Communist Party members." The people who were punished were all talked to individually beforehand, and they had no objection to the facts of the mistakes and the punishment, so they performed well at the branch general meeting. Some said: "Although I am not a Communist Party member anymore, I will work hard to produce and strive to be a model worker, and discuss things with the Party if something happens." Some said: "I will study hard and do a good job in the trade union work." Some said: "Produce well and atone for my sins."

     中共唐山市委在四个支部进行整党典型试验的报告（续完）
    （五）学习关于密切联系群众和党
        员的模范作用的问题
    学习这两课，目的在使党员从思想上、工作中明确建立正确的党和群众的关系。据了解：部分党员工作积极，作风也好，为群众所拥护，能带动工人完成任务；但大多数党员的群众观点还不明确，在工作中不善于走群众路线，党和群众的关系是不完全正常、密切的，如有的群众反应：“惹了那个党员有亏吃，他给咱们走报告。”有时群众在一起谈话时，见党员到来，就闭口不言了。至于个别作风恶劣的党员，在群众中的影响很坏。
    关于党员要起模范作用的问题，许多党员仅仅认为“好好生产，多干活，就是党员的模范作用”，不能及时宣传党的政策和反映群众的意见；有的抱着老好人的态度，有的为了个人出风头，而排斥旁人，甚至影响旁人的生产和工作，也有的一听说
    “模范作用”就头痛。
    关于密切联系群众和在群众中起模范作用这两个问题的学习，首先要讲解党员要密切联系群众和起模范作用的意义，继而结合他们思想上、工作上存在的问题，进行简要的分析，说明是非，讨论时联系实际，展开思想上、工作上的检查，强调以老老实实的态度，摆出好坏事例，进行分析批判，不仅批判坏的，而且肯定好的，指出方向。经验证明，在检查中除少数人的自我批评精神较差外，一般态度都很好，因而揭露了许多问题。经过批判，他们认识了党员必须密切联系群众，并要在群众中起模范作用，把群众团结起来，才能取得胜利，同时也认识到自己错误的根源及改正错误的办法。如有的说：“过去我老看着群众太落后，认为不强迫命令就完不成工作任务；现在认识了那是错误的思想，越给群众扣落后帽子、命令他们，他们越不接近我们，我们就会脱离群众，孤立起来，这是很危险的。”一个支部书记说：“过去我曾对一个挑皮工友举手就想打，当时认为大家都知道他不好，打他一顿也给旁人出气。现在检讨那是错误的和犯法的行为，应耐心说服教育才好。”有的党员检讨说：“过去我怕得罪人，老是一团和气，人家说啥是啥，东风西倒，西风东倒，现在认识了那不是联系群众，而是毫无立场，不是共产党员应有的品质。”也有的检讨说：“过去我就认为好好生产，不耍滑头就算起到党员应有的模范作用了。现在认识了，仅这样是不够的，必须把一切工作都作好，并经常听取群众的意见，反映到组织上，把党的政策随时向群众宣传解释，真正起到骨干作用。”
    经过这样的学习，工作有了起色，和群众的关系也有了改进。有些党员晚上十点钟还找支委和小组长研究红五月生产竞赛计划和抗美援朝工作。候补党员阎伯堂，过去是最落后的，经过了这次学习，有一天下班后，他看见灌灰布袋不够夜间用，恐怕耽误生产，当时他就找了一个工友，赶夜刷出了四百五十条灰袋，保证了生产，获得了工人群众的拥护，获得了工会车间委员会的表扬。候补党员冯立堂，过去也落后，经过这次学习，大有进步，他积极地找生产小组长研究生产计划，找宣传员研究宣传工作。有的工人群众说：“这次整党学习，党员进了一大步，等他们学习结束以后，再领导咱们也进一大步哩。”
    （六）进行关于忠诚老实的教育
    学习了关于党员的标准以后，党员的思想觉悟大有提高。对怎样做个共产党员，有了比较明确具体的认识，同时在联系实际中，大多数党员能掌握批评和自我批评的武器，把思想上和工作中存在的缺点和错误，进行了揭露和批判。但是对于历史上、政治上的问题，有的仅露了一点，有的没有谈，这是因为：一方面所讲的课程对这方面的问题直接启发性小，另一方面他们有某些顾虑，主要地是怕受处分。为了纯洁党的组织，我们认为在党员思想觉悟提高的基础上，进行关于忠诚老实的教育，以搞清历史为中心，开展坦白运动是必要的，而且是有条件做出成绩的。
    在进行关于忠诚老实的教育中，要讲明一个党员要献身于党的事业——也就是人民的事业，必须对党忠诚老实，这是党员宝贵的品质，是做一个党员应具备的起码条件之一。继而号召过去对党隐瞒了历史的人，现在应向党忠诚老实地交代清楚，并说明过去因为不知道而隐瞒，是可以原谅的，现在党讲明了，即应向党交代清楚，如再继续隐瞒，就是一错再错，将来在任何时候发觉有问题时，就将被认为是对党不忠实。
    讲后让大家思考，结合小组讨论，历史上没有问题或有问题已向党讲清楚的，表示轻松愉快；有隐瞒的则感到有压力，其中个别不愿坦白的，表现沉闷；有的避重就轻，谈点留点，看风头。而多数人内心斗争激烈，表现坐卧不安，吃不饱饭，睡不着觉；有的痛哭流涕，憎恨自己；有的谈出一点又后悔。这时应通过个别谈话，推动积极分子对大家进行启发帮助，解除顾虑。在小组讨论中，也注意要使大家在自觉基础上谈出问题，并及时纠正追逼、扣大帽子、讽刺等现象。这样就使得他们敢于大胆地揭发自己的问题，并进行深刻的检讨。如党员吕增会说：“我父亲过去当伪保长，曾带领国民党抓壮丁，我也从厂里拿过两枝枪，这些事入党时没敢谈，一直隐瞒到现在，谈出来怕受处分，不谈又是对党不忠实，自己想过去错了，今天再错下去，就更对不起党了，想到这儿，才有了勇气谈出来。”
    运动的开展是顺利的，并有很大成绩。党员坦白出来的问题，有属于思想错误的，有属于作风不正派的，有属于隐瞒历史的。计查明：恶霸地主成份，本人曾任新民会指导员，阻碍土地改革的一人；参加过我党，而后自由脱党的一人；叛党的一人；参加过革命工作而后妥协的四人；参加过国民党的反动组织“工矿党”的六人；当过伪军的二人；参加过反动会道门的七人；隐瞒家庭成份及社会关系的四人；伪造本人历史的一人。
    （七）进行党员的登记
    经过怎样做个共产党员的教育，又按着党员标准进行了一次复习，而后宣布党员登记。在动员登记时，着重讲明，每个党员要检查自己是否合乎党员标准，不够标准的是否有决心把自己提高到党员的标准？没有决心的，可以不登记。登记不登记，完全是自愿的。要求每个党员慎重考虑。
    这样宣布后，在两天内，大家的思想是很紧张的。有的在休息时或在深夜里，也拿着党员标准在熟读或衡量自己；有的走来走去，坐卧不安地考虑；有的主动找人帮助，征询别人的意见。特别是有些落后的党员，在学习时不大用心，这时临阵磨枪，拿着党员的八个条件，抄了又抄，写了又写，十分用心。由于党员进步情况的不同，他们考虑的中心也各有不同。有的考虑自己联系群众不够；有的考虑怕学习跟不上；但大多数党员是考虑党员标准中三、四、五条。因为这是和个人利益密切关联的问题。
    登记是由厂矿的党委派人主持的。在进行方法上：有的支部是由主持人找党员个别谈话后登记，这个方法不好，显示不出党员的自动性来；有的是由党员自觉自愿地向组织报告，表示要登记，再到登记处进行了个别谈话，而后签名，这个方法很好，做到了登记是自觉自愿的，同时也做到了登记做个党员，是件庄重严肃的事情，不是简单随便地签个名字就算完事的。在个别谈话中，绝大多数党员的态度，是诚恳坚决的，对自己的缺点和错误能虚心地检讨，并表示了自己的决心。如党员刘贵福在签名时写上：“我坚决执行党员八个条件，用实际行动回答党。”党员刘福善说：“过去我真对不起党，摆老资格，脱离群众，现在我一定下决心克服，如克服不了，要求组织给我严重的处分。”
    在个别谈话中，重点放在较落后的及坦白不彻底的党员身上，对他们问的较详细，凡是对党员标准仍不清楚及决心不足的人，均叫他们考虑成熟后，再来登记。如党员孙万田反复了三次，最后下决心不登记了。有两个党员在宣布登记后，考虑了几天才登记。登记是自愿的，也是决心按党员标准做个共产党员的表示，但不是重新入党，也不是按党员标准审查后，不够标准的给以清洗。因此，在登记时，按照党员标准进行检查是为了教育和提高党员，就是目前不够标准的，只要本人有决心，均允许登记了。
    登记的结果，参加整党的一百十四人中，未登记的有四人，主要是因为个人利益不能服从党的利益。登记后，绝大多数党员是轻松愉快的，但在大家的议论中，仍不时提醒自己，互相勉励。党员郭思贵说：“这次登记考验了我，没有为共产主义奋斗的决心，就做不成共产党员。”另一个党员说：
    “今后咱们支部可得好好地干了，谁有错误也要提出来。”党员姚永义包好印就的党员标准，保存起来，以备今后检查自己。但是历史上有问题及有严重错误的党员，仍是沉闷，他们担心鉴定时过不去。
    从这次登记中我们有以下的几点体会：
    一、经验证明，整党中进行了党员标准的教育之后，在自觉自愿的原则下，进行一次党员登记是完全必要的。登记有以下的好处：（1）使大家对党员标准的认识更深刻一步。大家的反应是：“这比在党训班学习半个月收获还大。”（2）经过检讨，给鉴定创造了有利条件，给以后坚持党员标准、巩固党的组织打下了较好的基础。（3）用自我淘汰的方法，清洗了一些今后还甘心落后的分子，提高了党的质量，又不伤感情。
    二、党员登记不是重新入党，也不是最后进行组织处理，因此应是来者不拒，但为了使决心不大的党员真正自觉自愿地有决心做个合乎标准的党员，登记中提出几个问题问一下，是有必要的。但是必须认识，决心也有假的，有的人虽然表示了决心，但顾虑并未完全解除；还有的人有各种各样的不良动机，所以经过登记，并不是全部问题都能解决的。
    三、登记是自觉自愿的，个人考虑，是主要方法，但不禁止互相交换意见。为了争取一切可能改造的分子，在个人考虑中，领导上推动积极分子帮助他们认识党员标准，进行检讨，解除顾虑，也是完全必要的。
    （八）鉴定和组织处理
    在登记后，进行鉴定。
    鉴定是按着党员标准，检查自己合乎哪点，哪点不够，今后努力方向是什么。鉴定的要求比登记又进了一步，登记主要的是个人按着党员标准检查，由于认识水平和思想顾虑的限制，对个人还不能有深刻和全面的认识。鉴定则要大家开展批评，要全面地较系统地认识一个人，并在这一认识基础上，通过小组的鉴定，对于有问题的需要进行组织处理的，由小组先提出意见，交支部大会讨论决定。
    鉴定是在经过准备具有一定条件的基础上进行的。所谓条件是：（1）大家觉悟都有提高，登记后对自己都有了一定的认识；（2）在学习阶段联系实际中，大家都互相了解；（3）经过批评和自我批评的锻炼，一般的能掌握这一武器。所谓有准备是：（1）领导整党的干部对党员经过各方面的必要的调查，对绝大部分党员有个底；开过积极分子会议，对落后分子及有问题的人如何处理，交换了意见，使他们心中有数，以便在党员群众中起骨干作用；（2）为了密切党和群众的关系，广泛收集材料，开过群众座谈会，听取了群众对各个党员的意见；（3）讲明鉴定的目的和标准及个人应持的态度，使每个人思想上有了准备。
    鉴定的进行，是严肃认真的，以诚恳的态度展开批评和自我批评，而没有追逼的现象。在开始时，曾发生只说缺点，不提优点的偏向，纠正后，能做到对一个人进行全面的批判。有个别落后分子思想上糊涂，自己检讨是东拉西扯、不着边际，说不出什么东西来，经过大家帮助，能认识到表面的几点优缺点，再深入地系统地认识自己是做不到的。有少数人态度不老实，说落后话，吞吞吐吐，轻描淡写；有的耍流氓态度，在鉴定中都曾加以揭露，严格地进行了批评。
    在鉴定中，对候补期已满的候补党员，由小组根据他们的具体情况，提出转正、延长候补期或取消候补党员资格的意见。对于不可教育改造的落后分子及混入党内的坏分子，也由小组提出处理意见，经支部大会讨论决定。在一百十四人中，最后处理结果，候补党员转正的三人，延长候补期的一人，取消候补党员资格的二人，正式党员中自由退党的三人（系落后分子），劝其退党的一人（系落后分子），开除党籍的五人（有变节分子一，当过伪自卫队分队长、作恶多端的分子二人，“工矿党”小组长一人，流氓分子一人），留党察看的二人，因材料不全还不能做最后处理者六人。
    从鉴定结果上看，经过整党后党的组织有了新的气象。除鉴定中清洗和自由脱党的以外，在一百零一人中：（1）过去工作上一贯积极，缺点不多，整党中有进步的六十一人；（2）过去落后或缺点很多，整党中有转变，思想上有很大提高，积极要求进步的三十人；（3）过去思想落后，缺点很多，整党中进步不大，但还有进步要求的十人。
    对于这次鉴定与组织处理，党员和群众有以下的反应：
    鉴定后，大家感觉轻松愉快，一般的表示要为做一个合乎标准的共产党员而奋斗！有的说：“鉴定好像洗了个澡。”有的说：“过去我是一个病人，鉴定把我治好了。”不少人说：“要互相帮助，随时随地以党员标准来衡量，才能做好党的工作。”
    作了组织处理后，有的说：“这回党的面貌一新了。”有的说：“这样党就纯洁了。”有的说：“这样处理很恰当。”党外群众说：“我参加了那天党的会议，我对党有了更明确的认识，国民党是打人骂人受奖励，共产党员如果走国民党的道路就不行。”“共产党员必须是好样的，否则不能做共产党员。”对受处分的人，事前都进行了个别谈话，他们对错误的事实及处分均无异议，因此在支部大会上他们表现还好。有的表示：“我虽不是共产党员了，但我要努力生产，争取做劳动模范，有事要和党商量。”有的说：“我要好好学习，做好工会工作。”有的说：“好好生产，将功赎罪。”
