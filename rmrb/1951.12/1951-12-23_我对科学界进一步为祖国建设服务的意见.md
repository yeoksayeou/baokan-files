    My Opinions on Further Service to National Construction from the Scientific Community
    Zhao Zhongyao, Researcher at the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    In the great movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, scientists across the country, while intensifying their work at their original posts, also seized opportunities to serve on the defense and production fronts. Over the past year, the dispatch of volunteer medical teams to the front lines, the creation of important industrial equipment, the discovery of large numbers of mining areas, and the eradication of crop diseases, among other things, have seen scientists make significant contributions. However, given the arduous nature of the Resist America and Aid Korea campaign, and the importance of scientific knowledge in modern national defense and production construction, the national scientific community needs to be further organized, working alongside workers and peasants, to complete the glorious task of building our motherland.
    I believe that in addition to exerting their greatest efforts at their original posts and earnestly implementing patriotic covenants, scientists should particularly intensify the following two tasks:
    First, scientists must integrate with the masses and popularize scientific knowledge. There are many areas in our industrial and agricultural production that can be improved, but currently, they are not receiving the help of scientists. If scientists integrate with workers and peasants and popularize scientific knowledge among the broad masses, then the working people can combine this knowledge with their own experience to improve production. Currently, there are many labor heroes who are making great contributions to production purely based on their enthusiasm and experience. I believe that if the scientific community can provide more scientific knowledge, our working people will surely have even more innovations. Over the past year, under the leadership of the National Association for Science Popularization, the scientific community has held approximately two thousand lectures and dozens of exhibitions nationwide. However, the number of lectures and exhibitions is still insufficient to meet actual needs. Moreover, only a small portion of scientists are participating in these activities. Therefore, we scientists must strengthen our ties with the people.
    Second, although the scientific community has made considerable achievements in national defense and production, it is still far from meeting the needs. Many scientists are willing to contribute their strength to the motherland. However, everyone must transform their thinking and needs the leadership to help them solve the difficulties of connecting with reality. Currently, the leaders of the national scientific community are helping everyone solve these problems. In this regard, I would also like to offer my own suggestions: (1) The scientific community should investigate the scientists and experts across the country, as well as the urgent problems in national defense and production. This will enable industrial departments and scientists to be closely linked, in order to change the past problem of things looking for people, people looking for things, and the two not connecting. (2) The scientific community should strengthen its organization and mobilize the broad masses of scientists to actively participate in activities to solve current problems. (3) Scientists should intensify their study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Not only must they know that they want to serve the people, but also how to serve the people. This is the only way to achieve the highest efficiency of service.
    I think the national scientific community should do the above three points well, so that every scientist can better serve the Resist America and Aid Korea campaign and serve the construction of the motherland.

    我对科学界进一步为祖国建设服务的意见
    中国科学院近代物理研究所研究员  赵忠尧
    在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，全国科学工作者一边在原来岗位上加紧工作；一边争取机会，在国防和生产战线上服务。一年以来，志愿医疗队的奔赴前线，重要工业器材的创制，大量矿区的发现，以及农作病害的解除等，科学工作者在这方面都有不少的贡献。不过以这次抗美援朝工作的艰巨，科学知识在现代国防建设和生产建设中的重要，全国科学界尚需进一步组织起来，和工人农民在一起，来完成建设祖国的光荣任务。
    我觉得现在科学工作者，除了应当在原来岗位上发挥最大的作用，切实厉行爱国公约以外，尤须加紧下列二项工作：
    第一，科学工作者必需和群众结合，普及宣传科学知识。在我们的工农业生产上有好多可以改进的地方，现在还得不到科学工作者的帮助。科学工作者若和工人农民结合起来，把科学知识普及到广大人民中间，那末劳动人民就能把这些知识结合自己的经验，改进生产。目前有很多劳动英雄，纯凭他们的热情和经验，对生产作出很大的贡献。我相信科学界倘使能多供给一些科学知识，我们的劳动人民必定会有更多的创造。一年以来，科学界在全国科学普及协会领导之下，已经举办了二千次左右的演讲，几十次的展览。不过演讲和展览的次数，还不能满足实际的需要。并且参加活动的科学工作者，也只是一小部分。所以我们科学工作者，必须加强和人民群众的联系。
    第二，科学界在国防和生产上，虽已有不少的成绩，但是和需要比起来，还相差太远。有很多科学工作者，是愿意把自己的力量，贡献给祖国的。不过大家还必须改造自己的思想，并需要领导上帮助大家解决联系实际的困难。现在全国科学界的领导者已正在帮助大家解决这些问题。对此，我并愿提出自己的几点意见：（一）科学界应当调查全国的科学工作者和专家，以及国防和生产上的急切问题。使产业部门和科学工作者能够密切连系起来，以改变过去事找人，人找事，两不接头的毛病。（二）科学界应当加强组织，并发动广大科学工作者自动来参加活动，来解决当前的问题。（三）科学工作者应当加紧马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的学习。不仅要知道要为人民服务，而且要知道如何为人民服务。这样才可以达到服务的最高效率。
    我想全国科学界，应当做好上面的三点，使每个科学工作者，能够更好地为抗美援朝服务，为建设祖国服务。
