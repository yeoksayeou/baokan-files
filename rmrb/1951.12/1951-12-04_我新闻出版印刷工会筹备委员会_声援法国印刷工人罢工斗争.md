    The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese News Publication and Printing Workers' Union
    Voices Support for the Strike Struggle of French Printing Workers
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] The French Printing Workers' Union issued a call for a general strike to protest the French reactionary government's police seizure of the "Marseillaise" newspaper's printing plant, in protest of the reactionary police's persecution of the "Marseillaise." On November 19th, all newspaper workers in France responded to this call and held a general strike. The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese News Publication and Printing Workers' Union sent a telegram to the French Printing Workers' Union, expressing support for their just struggle. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the French Printing Workers' Union:
    Recently, the Marseille police station in France forcibly occupied the "Marseillaise" newspaper's printing plant, attempting to obstruct the reactionary measures of printing democratic newspapers, which has aroused the indignation of the vast number of workers and staff in the Chinese news publication and printing industry. On behalf of all news publication and printing workers and staff, this committee, in addition to lodging a protest with the Marseille police station, expresses warm support for your just struggle!
    The "Marseillaise" is a progressive and democratic newspaper. It represents the will and interests of the vast majority of the French people. Therefore, your strike struggle against the unreasonable persecution by the Marseille police station is completely just and in line with the demands of the vast majority of the French people. All peace-loving and progressive people in the world deeply sympathize with and support you.
    Your great strike movement has already dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary authorities. We hope that you will continue to carry out a resolute struggle, and we believe that final victory will surely belong to you.
    With brotherly greetings!
        Preparatory Committee of the Chinese News Publication and Printing Workers' Union
