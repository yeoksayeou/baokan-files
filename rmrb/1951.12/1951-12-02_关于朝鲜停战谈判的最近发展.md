    Regarding Recent Developments in the Korean Armistice Negotiations
   (1) Question: What is the recent situation in the Korean armistice negotiations?
    Answer: Recently, both sides have reached an agreement on the issue of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, but after this, there are still many major issues that need to be resolved.
    On November 23rd, representatives of both sides of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Subcommittee reached an agreement on the issue of "determining the military demarcation line for both sides to establish a demilitarized zone" based on the fair and reasonable proposals of the Korean and Chinese sides. Afterwards, on the 27th, the delegation of negotiating representatives officially passed this agreement at a plenary meeting. The content of this agreement is: to determine the actual line of contact between the two armies as the military demarcation line, and each side's army will withdraw two kilometers from this line to establish a demilitarized zone during the armistice period. If the entire armistice agreement is signed within thirty days from the date of the agreement on the issue of the armistice military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, the actual contact line at the time of reaching this agreement will be the military demarcation line; otherwise, the military demarcation line should be modified accordingly based on changes in the actual contact line at the time of signing the armistice agreement.
    The agreement on the issue of the armistice military demarcation line is the first important progress made in the Korean armistice negotiations in more than four months. This agreement is important because determining the military demarcation line and establishing a demilitarized zone are fundamental conditions for achieving an armistice.
    However, the issue of the military demarcation line is only one item on the armistice negotiation agenda, namely item two (the first item on the agenda is "adoption of the agenda"); there are other important items on the agenda that still need to be discussed and agreed upon. According to the agenda unanimously adopted by both parties on July 27, these items to be discussed and agreed upon are:
    "(3) Specific arrangements for the implementation of ceasefire and armistice in Korea, including the composition, powers and functions of the institution supervising the implementation of ceasefire and armistice terms.
    "(4) Arrangements for prisoners of war.
    "(5) Recommendations to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides." Among them, the fifth item, "Both parties agree to discuss under the fifth agenda item recommendations to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides to convene a higher-level conference of representatives of both sides after the implementation of the armistice agreement for a certain period to negotiate the phased withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea."
    On November 27th, after the delegation meeting of both parties reached an agreement on the second agenda item, it immediately entered into the discussion of the third agenda item. However, due to the unreasonable demands put forward by the U.S. side, which went beyond the scope of the agenda, attempting to prolong the state of the Korean War and interfere in the internal affairs of Korea, the discussion of the third agenda item has not made progress until now. (2) Question: The discussion of the second agenda item was obstructed and delayed by the U.S. side for as long as four months. Why did it finally reach an agreement recently?
    Answer: The only reason why the discussion on the issue of the military demarcation line took four months to reach an agreement is that the United States has consistently adopted tactics of obstruction and delay in the negotiations. From the day the discussion of this issue began in late July, the U.S. side has continuously put forward various unreasonable conditions and created various provocative incidents to obstruct the progress of the negotiations. There are two purposes for the U.S. side to obstruct and delay the negotiations: The first purpose is to pressure our side to accept its unreasonable demands. For example, the U.S. side once unreasonably demanded that our side withdraw from more than 12,000 square kilometers of land from the actual line of contact between the two sides; after this absurd demand was firmly rejected by our side, it recently proposed that our side unilaterally withdraw from 1,500 square kilometers of area, including Kaesong. The second purpose is to continue to create a tense atmosphere in the international situation in order to continue to expand its armaments and prepare for war in the United States itself and force its satellite countries to do the same. In order to achieve these ulterior motives, the U.S. imperialists used unprecedentedly despicable and barbaric means in the negotiation process, assassinating our military police, bombing and strafing our negotiation delegation; they used so-called "military pressure" to launch three major "offensives" and many small attacks against our side; finally, they even attempted to simply overturn the second agenda item unanimously agreed upon by both sides.
    However, all the conspiracies of the U.S. side to delay and obstruct the negotiations have finally completely gone bankrupt. They were finally forced to abandon their various absurd and unreasonable demands on the issue of the military demarcation line and accept the fair and reasonable suggestions put forward by our side. The reason why the U.S. side's tactics of obstruction and delay failed is because: First, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army resolutely smashed all the "offensives" and attacks of the U.S. invading army, causing them unprecedentedly heavy casualties. At the same time, our negotiating delegation adopted an extremely patient and firm attitude, resolutely rejecting and exposing the unreasonable demands and despicable provocative acts of the U.S. side. Second, the anti-war and war-weary sentiments of the people and soldiers in the United Kingdom and other countries are growing, and they are increasingly dissatisfied with the policy of the U.S. ruling figures to delay negotiations. They demand that U.S. and British soldiers no longer die in vain in Korea and that they be allowed to go home for Christmas. Even the governments of satellite countries such as Britain and France have expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's policy of indefinitely delaying negotiations and continuing war adventures. Third, the broad masses of people in all countries of the world oppose the despicable behavior of the United States in delaying the Korean negotiations, which has made the United States increasingly isolated politically. Fourth, the U.S. imperialists themselves are in extremely difficult situations. The Korean War has long become a "bottomless pit" for the United States. It is precisely because of this that the U.S. imperialists were forced to hold armistice negotiations with our side. It is also because of this that the U.S. policy of delaying negotiations will inevitably fail in the end.
    The facts of the past four months have proved that our side is firmly advocating a just and peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. As long as the people of our country and the Korean people and the peace-loving people of all countries in the world persist in their efforts, as long as the U.S. side is willing to accept the fair and reasonable proposals put forward by our side, the Korean armistice negotiations can succeed; otherwise, the negotiations may continue to be delayed.
    (3) Question: What is hindering the achievement of an agreement on the third agenda item?
    Answer: Since the two sides began discussing the third agenda item on November 27th, the U.S. side has put forward new unreasonable demands. Until now, the U.S. side is still insisting on this unreasonable demand, which prevents the discussion of this agenda item from making progress.
    The third agenda item unanimously adopted by both parties clearly stipulates that the scope of this agenda item is the specific arrangements for the implementation of the armistice, including the composition, powers and functions of the institution supervising the implementation of the armistice terms. Our delegation has put forward five reasonable principled proposals, namely: all armed forces of both sides shall cease hostilities from the date of signing the armistice agreement; all armed forces of both sides shall withdraw from the demilitarized zone within five days of signing the armistice agreement; within five days after the signing of the armistice agreement, all armed forces of both sides shall withdraw from the other side's rear and coastal islands, with the military demarcation line as the boundary; all armed forces of both sides shall not enter the demilitarized zone and shall not carry out any armed actions in the area; both sides shall each designate an equal number of commissioners to form an armistice commission, which shall be jointly responsible for the specific arrangements and supervision of the implementation of the armistice agreement.
    However, the U.S. side has gone beyond the scope of the agenda and suggested that neither side should increase military supplies, equipment, or personnel in Korea during the armistice period, and therefore suggested that the institutions supervising the armistice and their observation groups should have the right to freely enter and exit all of Korea. These conditions in the U.S. proposal are extremely unreasonable. They attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the name of supervising the armistice; they attempt to refuse to withdraw troops from Korea, refuse to end the state of war in Korea, and demand to maintain the balance of forces between the two sides under the state of war in order to maintain the tense situation in Korea for a long time. As our representative pointed out: In order to ensure that hostile acts do not occur after the Korean armistice, it is necessary to completely eliminate the state of war, and it is necessary to actively reduce the military forces of both sides and withdraw all foreign troops from Korea. However, the U.S. representative refused to discuss the issue of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea, and only agreed to leave this issue for discussion at a conference attended by higher-level representatives of both sides. From this, it can be seen that the above-mentioned suggestions of the U.S. side are self-contradictory and untenable. And the above-mentioned unreasonable suggestions of the U.S. side have now become an obstacle to achieving an agreement on the third agenda item.

### 关于朝鲜停战谈判的最近发展

    关于朝鲜停战谈判的最近发展
   （一）问：朝鲜停战谈判最近情形怎样？
    答：最近双方已对停战军事分界线及非军事区问题取得协议，但在这以后还有许多重大问题需要解决。
    十一月二十三日朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会双方代表，根据朝、中方面公平合理的建议，就“确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事区”问题，达到协议。以后，双方谈判代表团在二十七日举行全体会议，正式通过了这一协议。这个协议的内容是：确定以双方军队的实际接触线为军事分界线，双方军队各由此线后退两公里，以建立停战期间的非军事区。如果整个停战协议在自停战军事分界线及非军事区问题获得协议的一天起三十天内签字，就以达成这项协议时的实际接触线为军事分界线；否则，军事分界线应根据停战协议签字时实际接触线的变化作相应的修改。
    停战军事分界线问题的达成协议，是朝鲜停战谈判进行四个多月以来所取得的第一个重要进展。这个协议是重要的，因为确定停战军事分界线和建立非军事区，是实现停战的一个基本条件。
    可是，军事分界线问题，只是停战谈判议程的一项，即议程的第二项（议程的第一项是“通过议程”）；议程上还有其他重要项目。根据七月二十七日双方所一致通过的议程，这些尚待讨论和协议的项目是：
    “（三）在朝鲜境内实现停火与休战的具体安排，包括监督停火休战条款实施机构的组成、权力与职司。
    “（四）关于俘虏的安排问题。
    “（五）向双方有关各国政府建议事项。”其中第五项，“双方同意在第五项议程下讨论向双方有关各国政府建议，在停战协定实施后一定期限内，召开双方高一级的代表会议，协商从朝鲜分期撤退一切外国军队的问题”。
    十一月二十七日，双方代表团会议在对第二项议程取得协议后，已立即进入第三项议程的讨论。但是，由于美方提出了越出议程范围的、妄想拖长朝鲜战争状态并干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求，第三项议程的讨论，直到现在还没有获得进展。（二）问：第二项议程的讨论被美方阻挠和拖
    延了足足四个月，为什么终于在最近取得了协议？
    答：军事分界线问题的讨论进行了四个月之久才取得协议，唯一的原因是美国一贯对谈判采取了阻挠和拖延战术。从七月下旬开始讨论这个问题的一天起，美国方面就不断地提出各种无理条件，制造各种挑衅事件，来阻挠谈判的进行。美国方面所以要阻挠和拖延谈判的进行，有两个目的：第一个目的是压迫我方接受它的无理要求。比如：美方曾经无理地要求我方从双方实际接触线退出一万二千余平方公里的土地；在这个荒谬要求遭到我方坚决拒绝后，不久以前又提出要我方片面地退出一千五百平方公里地区，包括开城在内的要求。第二个目的是要继续制造国际局势的紧张气氛，以便在美国自己国内并强迫美国的仆从国继续扩军备战。为了达到这些不可告人的目的，美国帝国主义者在谈判过程中，曾经用了空前卑鄙野蛮的手段，暗杀我方军事警察，轰炸扫射我方谈判代表团；曾经使用了所谓“军事压力”，向我方发动了三次大的“攻势”和多次小的攻击；最后，甚至企图干脆推翻双方所
    一致同意的第二项议程。
    但是美方拖延和阻挠谈判进行的这一切阴谋，终于完全破产了，他们最后被迫放弃了他们自己在军事分界线问题上的各种荒谬无理的要求，而接受了我方所提出的公平合理的建议。美方阻挠和拖延战术所以破产，是因为：第一，我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军坚决地粉碎了美国侵略军的一切“攻势”和攻击，使他们受到了空前惨重的伤亡。同时，我方谈判代表团采取极忍耐而又极坚定的态度，坚决地拒绝和揭露了美方的无理要求和卑鄙的挑衅行为。第二，美英等国的人民和士兵厌战、反战的情绪日益发展，他们对于美国统治人物拖延谈判的政策日益不满，而要求让美英的士兵不要再在朝鲜白白送死，要求让他们回家去过圣诞节。甚至英、法等仆从国政府，对于美国政府无限期地拖延谈判，继续进行战争冒险的政策，也表示不满。第三，世界各国广大人民反对美国拖延朝鲜谈判的卑鄙行为，这使美国方面在政治上越来越孤立。第四，美国帝国主义者自己的处境极端困难。朝鲜战争早就成了美国的“无底洞”。正因为这样，美帝国主义者才被迫与我方举行停战谈判。也因为这样，美国拖延谈判的政策，在最后一定要失败。
    过去四个多月的事实证明：我方是坚决主张朝鲜问题的公正和平解决的。只要我国人民和朝鲜人民及世界各国爱好和平的人民坚持努力，只要美方愿意接受我方所提出的公平合理的主张，朝鲜停战谈判是能够成功的，否则谈判就可能继续被拖延下去。
    （三）问：阻碍第三项议程取得协议的是什么？
    答：自从十一月二十七日双方开始讨论第三项议程以来，美方又提出新的无理要求。直到现在美方还在坚持这种无理要求，这样就使这项议程的讨论不能获得进展。
    双方所一致通过的第三项议程明白规定，这项议程的范围是实现停战的具体安排，包括监督停战条款实施机构的组成、权力和职司在内。我方代表团已提出五项合理的原则建议，即：双方一切武装力量从停战协定签字之日起停止敌对行动；停战协定签字后三天内双方一切武装力量自非军事区撤出；停战协定签字后五天内双方一切武装力量，以军事分界线为界，自对方后方及沿海岛屿撤走；双方一切武装力量均不得进入非军事区，并不得对该地区进行任何武装行动；双方各指定同等数目的委员，组成停战委员会，共同负责具体安排和监督停战协议的实施。
    但是美方却越出议程范围，建议双方在停战期间都不得在朝鲜增强军事供应、装备与人员，因而建议监督停战的机构及其观察小组应有权自由出入于全部朝鲜。美方建议中的这些条件是极端无理的。他们企图以监督停战为名，干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政；他们企图拒绝自朝鲜撤退军队，拒绝结束朝鲜的战争状态，而要求保持战争状态下双方力量的平衡，以便把朝鲜的紧张局势长期保持下去。正如我方代表所指出：为了保证朝鲜停战后敌对行为不再发生，就必须彻底地消除战争状态，就必须积极地减少双方的军事力量，从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队。但是美方代表却又拒绝讨论自朝鲜撤退外国军队问题，而仅仅同意将这一问题留待双方高一级的代表参加的会议去讨论。由此可见，美方的上述建议是自相矛盾而不能成立的。而美方的上述无理建议，现在已经成为第三项议程取得协议的障碍。
