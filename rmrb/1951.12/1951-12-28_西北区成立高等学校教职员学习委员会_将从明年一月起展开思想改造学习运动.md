    Northwest Region Establishes Higher Education Faculty and Staff Study Committee; Ideological Remolding Study Movement to Begin in January
    The faculty and staff of higher education institutions in the Northwest Region will begin a planned ideological remolding study movement in January of next year. To strengthen leadership over this movement, the Northwest Region Higher Education Faculty and Staff Study Committee was established on December 11th, with Yang Mingxuan, director of the Culture and Education Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, serving as director. More than 2,500 faculty and staff members from eleven higher education institutions and their affiliated units, including Northwest University and Northwest Arts Academy, will participate in this study. The study period is scheduled for six months.
    Since liberation, the faculty and staff of higher education institutions in the Northwest Region have undergone preliminary self-remolding study and movements such as Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Land Reform, and Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries, and their political and ideological levels have improved to some extent. After the launch of the ideological remolding study movement for teachers in higher education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin, they all hoped that this movement could be quickly launched in the Northwest Region. After the establishment of the Northwest Region Higher Education Faculty and Staff Study Committee, many school faculty and staff members enthusiastically supported it. Xin Shuzhi, President of Northwest Agricultural College, and the heads of various units of the college, jointly wrote a letter stating: "We must set an example within the college, take the lead, and ensure that the ideological remolding study of the entire college is done well."

    西北区成立高等学校教职员学习委员会
     将从明年一月起展开思想改造学习运动
    西北区高等学校教职员将在明年一月起有计划地展开思想改造学习运动。为了加强对这一运动的领导，西北区高等学校已在十二月十一日成立西北区高等学校教职员学习委员会，由西北军政委员会文化教育委员会主任杨明轩任主任。参加这次学习的，有西北大学、西北艺术学院等十一个高等学校及其附属单位的教职员二千五百多人。学习时间预定为六个月。
    西北区各高等学校教职员在解放以来，经过初步自我改造学习和抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等运动，政治思想水平已有某些提高，自北京、天津高等学校教师展开思想改造学习运动后，他们都希望这一运动能在西北区迅速展开。西北区高等学校教职员学习委员会成立后，许多学校教职员都热烈拥护。西北农学院院长辛树帜和该院各单位的负责人曾联名写信表示：“要在院内以身作则，起带头作用，并保证把全院的思想改造学习搞好。”
