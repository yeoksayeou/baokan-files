Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The criticism published on page two of the People's Daily on September 12th by the Liaodong Province Forestry Administration regarding the Liaodong Province Veterans Administration and the Liuhe County Forestry Department's "aiding and abetting illegal logging and selling timber to private merchants" is entirely accurate. The main reason for this error is that our department did not regularly inspect and monitor the logging operations of the Liuhe County Veterans Farm, which is under the jurisdiction of the Liaodong Province Veterans Administration, resulting in an over-extraction of 900 cubic meters of timber and damage to the national forest. This demonstrates that our department's work is not thorough and that we have a serious bureaucratic work style. According to regulations, this batch of excess timber should have been confiscated and reported to higher authorities for handling, but our department confiscated the timber and then sold it to private merchants to profit and subsidize the financial income of our own agency. This is a completely erroneous act that only considers the interests of the department and disregards the overall interests of the country. After seeing the criticism in the newspaper and the State Council's instructions on saving timber, we deeply felt that we had violated national laws and wasted national resources. We must strengthen our learning in the future to ensure that similar errors do not occur again.

### 柳河县人民政府农林科  检讨助长滥伐木材和出卖木材给私商的错误行为

    柳河县人民政府农林科
    检讨助长滥伐木材和出卖木材给私商的错误行为
    编辑同志：九月十二日人民日报第二版刊登的辽东省林政处对辽东省荣军管理处及柳河县农林科“助长滥伐木材并卖给私商”的批评，完全属实。发生这个错误的原因，主要是我科对辽东省荣军管理处所属柳河县荣军农场的采伐作业，没有经常检查和掌握情况，以致发生超额采伐木材九百立方公尺，破坏国家森林的事情。这说明我科工作不深入，存在严重的官僚主义工作作风。这批超额木材按规定应予没收并报请上级处理，但我科没收这批超额木材后，竟然出卖给私商，从中获利，补助本机关的财政收入。这完全是只顾本位利益不顾国家整体利益的错误行为。当我们看到报纸上的批评和政务院关于节约木材的指示以后，我们深深感到违反了国家法令，浪费了国家资财。我们今后一定要加强学习，保证不再有类似错误发生。
