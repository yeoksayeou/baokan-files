Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. At the subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice talks on the 8th, the opposing side's representatives still refused to express their attitude towards our side's proposal to invite neutral countries to establish a supervisory body. They claimed that they could not discuss our side's two principles proposed on December 3 until all other principles were determined and insisted on all unreasonable suggestions and demands that our side had clearly stated as absolutely unacceptable before December 3. Our representative pointed out that the other side's attitude was unprepared to solve the problem, did not want the negotiations to proceed quickly, and was completely unsatisfactory. Our side reiterated that the disposition of all facilities within the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is its own internal affair and does not allow anyone to interfere in the slightest. The other side's proposal to restrict the construction of military facilities and restrict civil aviation is absolutely unacceptable. Since the military demarcation line has been determined, the armed forces of both sides should naturally withdraw from the other side's rear and coastal islands and sea areas within a limited time. The other side's attempt to retain its armed forces in our rear is absolutely intolerable. Even more unreasonable is that the other side insists on continuing to transport military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under the pretext of rotating armed forces and personnel and replenishing weapons and ammunition. They also insist that the other side should have the right to freely enter and exit the entire territory of Korea for all inspections, while refusing to express an attitude towards our side's reasonable proposal that both sides jointly invite representatives from neutral countries to establish a supervisory body responsible for conducting necessary inspections at mutually agreed-upon rear ports outside the demilitarized zone. This attitude of the US side is enough to show that it is pursuing an ulterior motive. Our representative severely condemned the other side's unreasonable attitude at the meeting on December 8 and sternly pointed out that if the other side insisted on such absurd and unreasonable suggestions and demands, the negotiations would not be able to make progress, and the responsibility for delaying the armistice negotiations would rest entirely with the US side.

    我方严斥美方荒谬无理的要求
    指出谈判无法获得进展美方应负全责
    【新华社开城八日电】八日的朝鲜停战谈判的小组委员会上，对方代表对于我方所提出的邀请中立国家成立监察机构的建议，仍然拒绝表示态度，声称在其他各项原则全部确定以前，根本不能讨论我方十二月三日的两项原则建议，并坚持一切在十二月三日以前已经为我方所明确声明绝对不能接受的无理建议和要求。我方代表指出：对方的这种态度是不准备解决问题的，是不希望谈判能够迅速进展的，是完全不能令人满意的。我方再次指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国对其境内一切设备的处理都属于他自己的内政问题，不容许任何人加以丝毫的干涉。对方提出的所谓限制军事设备的建设和限制民用航空事业的主张，是绝对不能容许的。军事分界线既已确定，双方的武装力量就自然应该限期撤出对方的后方和沿海岛屿与海面，对方坚持在我方后方保留其武装力量的企图是绝对不能容忍的。更没有理由的是对方坚持以武装部队与人员的轮换和武器、弹药的补充为藉口，在停战期间继续从朝鲜境外运进军事力量和武器、弹药，并坚持对方应有自由出入朝鲜全境进行一切视察的权利，而对我方建议的双方共同邀请中立国家的代表成立监察机构，负责到非军事区以外双方同意的后方口岸进行必要视察的合理主张，则拒绝表示态度。美方这种态度正足以表明他是在追求着一种不可告人的目的。我方代表在十二月八日的会上痛斥对方的这种无理态度，并严词指出如果对方坚持这种荒谬无理的建议和要求，则谈判将无法获得进展，而拖延停战谈判的责任将完全在于美方。
