To the Editor:

    Chu Junshan (Communist Party member) and Li Yu (Youth League member), mechanical technicians from the Electrical and Mechanical Section of the Liaoning West An Coal Mine, after several months of painstaking research, created the "Coal Car Cotter Pin Safety Lock." This creation fundamentally prevents runaway accidents, ensures the safety of workers, and greatly reduces the loss of state property. This September, the West An Coal Mine launched a production increase and savings movement. Encouraged by the administration and the trade union, Chu Junshan and Li Yu carefully studied and discovered that the main reason for runaway accidents was that the iron cotter pins between the coal cars were easily broken and often popped out. They successively designed four sets of tool drawings to prevent the iron cotter pins from breaking and popping out, but all failed. They were not discouraged and continued their research. On November 25th, they drew the design of the coal car cotter pin safety lock. They manufactured the coal car cotter pin safety lock according to this design. The safety lock has a very simple structure and is pieced together from parts such as screws and springs. The "pressure iron" of the safety lock presses against the iron cotter pin between the coal car and the coal car, so that the iron cotter pin will not pop out even when the coal car is running fast. They changed the 32 mm thick iron cotter pin to a 38 mm thick iron cotter pin, so that it is not easy to break. Now, all mines under the West An mining area are universally promoting the use of this safety lock.

    试制煤车插销安全锁成功防止跑车事故减少了损失
    编辑同志：辽东西安煤矿工电股机械技术员初俊山（共产党员）、李瑜（青年团员）经过几个月的苦心研究，创造了“煤车插销安全锁”。这一创造，从根本上防止了跑车事故，保障了工人的安全，大大减少了国家财富的损失。今年九月，西安煤矿展开了增产节约运动。初俊山、李瑜在行政和工会的鼓励下，细心研究，发现了造成跑车事故的主要原因，是煤车间的铁插销容易断了，铁插销常常蹦出来。他们先后设计了四个防止铁插销折断和蹦出来的工具图样，都失败了。他们毫不灰心，继续研究，在十一月二十五日，又画出了煤车插销安全锁的图样。他们依照这个图样，制造了煤车插销安全锁。这个安全锁构造很简单，是由螺丝、弹簧等零件拼成的。安全锁的“压铁”压住煤车和煤车间的铁插销，使煤车即使在飞跑时，铁插销也蹦不出来。他们把三十二米毫粗的铁插销，改成三十八米毫粗的铁插销，这样就不容易断了。现在，西安矿区所属各矿正在普遍推广使用这种安全锁。
