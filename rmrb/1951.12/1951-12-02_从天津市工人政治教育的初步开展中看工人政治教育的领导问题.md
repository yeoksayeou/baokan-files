From the Initial Development of Political Education for Workers in Tianjin: On the Leadership Problems in Political Education for Workers

Li Wen

More than 136,000 workers in Tianjin have participated in systematic political study.

This work began with the political study during the Tianjin cotton textile workers' strike in June and July of this year. Prior to this, Tianjin had not seriously carried out political education for workers for a long period. Many responsible cadres in factories had various erroneous understandings: some regarded the level of awareness of a few Party members or activists as the level of awareness of the broad masses of workers, and believed that the workers' political awareness was almost enough. Some believed, "I haven't conducted systematic political education for the workers, but production is still not bad." They thought that reading the newspaper and giving two reports were enough. Others believed that "without education, it's impossible to study politics; workers can't accept lectures on theory." The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party criticized the above-mentioned tendency to neglect workers' political education, clearly pointed out the importance of conducting systematic political education for the masses of workers, and, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Committee, organized a 70-member lecture group headed by Comrade Huang Jing, Secretary of the Municipal Committee. During the cotton textile workers' strike, the group went to various cotton textile factories to lecture on courses such as "Class and Class Struggle," "The Historical Mission of the Working Class," "The Communist Party of China," "China's New Democratic Society," and "Socialism and Communism." This enabled the workers to acquire basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in their studies, thereby fundamentally strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses of workers.

The gains of the cotton textile workers' political study have proven with facts that systematic political education among the broad masses of workers is not only necessary but also can be taught well.

Before studying, many workers, although feeling that the Communist Party was good because of the improvement in their lives after liberation, still had some incorrect views about the Party and the People's Government and did not understand why the working class was the leading class of the country. For example, some people said, "I used to watch the cars, and I still watch the cars; I used to sweep the floor, and I still sweep the floor. How am I the master?" Many workers still had remnants of feudal ideas and fatalism. Some female workers said, "A bitter melon bears bitter fruit; it has been like this since the beginning of time. I can only blame myself for being born into the wrong womb." After a month of political study, the vast majority of workers acquired more systematic basic theoretical knowledge, thereby changing their erroneous understandings. After the workers realized the important role and historical mission of the working class in national construction, they developed a strong sense of ownership. They said, "To strive for the early arrival of socialism, we must step up production." Some workers criticized the past idea of competing purely for awards. Guo Lanming of the State-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory said, "In the past, when I was asked to make a plan to fold 150 bolts of cloth a day, I would 'take it easy' after folding enough. How could this be like a master!" After the cotton textile factories resumed work, a patriotic production upsurge was quickly launched. When the workers of Beiyang Yarn Factory heard that work would resume on the 27th, everyone consciously asked to enter the factory on the 26th to happily inspect the machines and clean the workshops, and quickly started all the machines on the 27th. The Wei Shuzhen group in the warping workshop of Hengyuan Yarn Factory used to quarrel with the sizing workshop, causing disunity. After this political study, in order to improve production, they took the initiative to seek advice from the experienced masters in the sizing workshop, which moved the masters in the sizing workshop. The two sides signed a contact contract and improved production.

The Municipal Committee's strengthening of leadership over workers' political education and the significant gains of the cotton textile workers' political study have fundamentally reversed the atmosphere of neglecting workers' political education among cadres and paved the way for political study by industrial workers in the future. After the cotton textile workers' study ended, the municipal leadership organs carried out various preparations for conducting political education among the masses of industrial workers throughout the city, such as compiling political textbooks, registering and reviewing teachers, and intensively training cultural and educational committee members of grassroots trade unions. When political study began universally in all factories throughout the city in early October, it immediately received a universal and warm welcome from the broad masses of workers. After attending political classes, some workers automatically signed learning pledges to ensure good political study. The workers said, "If the working class does not study politics, it is like an airplane without a compass. How can it fly?"

However, there is also another situation that is incompatible with this: some leading cadres in some factories still hold a cold attitude towards the workers' enthusiastic demands for political study. Some verbally admit the importance of political study but one-sidedly emphasize that production work is busy, thereby encroaching on political study time. Some Party branches and trade union cadres in some units shirk responsibility and relax leadership over workers' political study. Some factory leaders lack a clear understanding of systematic political education and are satisfied with general policy education instead of teaching according to the political textbooks, which makes the teaching content very disorganized. The workers said, "Didn't you say it would be systematic? Today you talk about this, tomorrow you talk about that. When will it be systematic!" In response to the above situation, the Tianjin leadership organs held a liaison meeting of cadres from the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League systems of major factories in mid-November. They criticized the tendency of some factories to neglect workers' political study, summarized the preliminary experience of carrying out workers' political education, and required the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League of each factory to give due importance to workers' political education and to be responsible for it under the leadership of the Party. At the same time, they vigorously utilized and gave play to the strength of workers' spare-time schools, added political classes to the curriculum of spare-time schools, and, on the existing basis of the spare-time schools of major factories (about 50 percent of the workers in each factory have already participated in cultural studies in spare-time schools), absorbed all workers to participate in regular political study, gradually making workers' political study more standardized.

    从天津市工人政治教育的初步开展中看工人政治教育的领导问题
    力文
    天津市已有十三万六千余工人，参加了系统的政治学习。
    这一工作是从今年六、七月间，本市棉纺工人停工期间的政治学习开始的。在这以前，天津市在较长时期内没有认真进行工人的政治教育工作。不少工厂的负责干部，曾有着种种错误的认识：有些人将少数党员或积极分子的觉悟程度，看作是广大职工群众的觉悟程度，而认为工人政治觉悟已差不多了。有些人认为：“我没有向工人进行系统的政治教育，生产工作也搞得不坏。”他们认为读读报，作两次报告就够了。有些人则认为“没文化就无法学习政治，向工人讲理论，工人接受不了”。中共天津市委批驳了上述忽视工人政治教育的倾向，明确指出向工人群众进行系统的政治教育的重要性，并在市委直接领导下，组织了以市委书记黄敬同志为首的七十人的讲师团，在棉纺工人停工期间，分组到各棉纺厂讲授“阶级和阶级斗争”、“工人阶级的历史任务”、“中国共产党”、“中国新民主主义社会”、“社会主义和共产主义”等课程，使工人群众在学习中获得马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的基本理论知识，从而从根本上加强了党和工人群众的联系。
    棉纺工人政治学习的收获，用事实证明了：在广大工人群众中进行系统的政治教育，不仅是必要的，而且能够教得好的。
    许多工人在未学习以前，虽然因为解放后生活的改善，觉得共产党好，但对党对人民政府还有着若干不正确的看法，不了解工人阶级为什么是国家的领导阶级。比如，有人说：“我过去看车，现在还看车，过去扫地，现在仍扫地，我怎的是主人呢？”不少工人还残存着封建思想，宿命论，有些女工说：“苦瓜结苦子，开天辟地就是这样的，只怪自己错投了娘胎。”经过一个月的政治学习之后，绝大多数工人获得了较系统的基本的理论知识，从而改变了自己的错误认识。工人们认识到工人阶级在国家建设中的重大作用和历史任务之后，产生了强烈的主人翁感觉。他们说：“为争取社会主义赶快到来，必须加紧生产。”有些工友则批判了过去单纯为得奖而竞赛的思想。国营第一棉纺厂郭兰明说：“过去叫我订计划，每天叠布一百五十匹，我叠够数就‘泡蘑菇’，这怎么像个主人样子！”各棉纺厂开工后，都很快掀起了爱国生产高潮。北洋纱厂工人听说二十七日开工，大家都自觉地要求二十六日进厂，愉快地检查机器，打扫车间，二十七日很快地将车全部开全。恒源纱厂整经间魏淑贞小组，过去常和浆纱间吵架，闹不团结，这次政治学习后，她们为了搞好生产，主动向浆纱老师傅征求意见，感动了浆纱间的老师傅，双方签订了联系合同，提高了生产。
    市委对工人政治教育的加强领导，和棉纺工人政治学习的显著收获，基本上扭转了干部中忽视工人政治教育的空气，为以后产业工人的政治学习开辟了道路。在棉纺工人学习结束之后，市级领导机关为在全市产业工人群众中普遍进行政治教育，进行了编写政治课本、登记和审查教员，以及集训各基层工会文教委员等各项准备工作。当十月初，全市各工厂普遍开始政治学习的时候，立即获得广大工人群众普遍而热烈的欢迎。有些工人听过政治课后，便自动订了学习公约，保证搞好政治学习。工人们说：“工人阶级不学习政治，就像飞机没有指南针一样，怎能飞行呢？”
    但也有和这不相适应的另外一种情况：仍有部分工厂的领导干部，对工人群众学习政治的热烈要求抱冷淡态度。有的是口头上承认政治学习重要，却片面强调生产工作忙，而侵占政治学习时间，有的单位党支部和工会干部相互推诿责任，放松对工人政治学习的领导；有些厂的领导干部，对系统的政治教育缺乏明确的认识，而是满足于一般政策性的教育，不按政治课本上课，因而使教学内容显得很零乱。工人们说：“不是说系统的讲吗？今天讲个这，明天讲个那，什么时候才能系统啊！”针对上述情况，天津市领导机关又于十一月中旬，召开了各主要工厂，党、政、工、团各系统干部的联系会议。批判了某些工厂忽视工人政治学习的偏向，总结了开展工人政治教育工作的初步经验，要求各工厂的党、政、工、团对工人的政治教育均给以应有的重视，并在党的领导下分工负责。同时大力运用与发挥职工业余学校的力量，在业余学校课程中添设政治课，并在各大工厂业余学校旧有的基础（各厂有百分之五十左右的工人群众，已参加业余学校的文化学习）上，吸收所有工人参加经常性的政治学习，逐步使工人的政治学习走向正规。（附图片）
