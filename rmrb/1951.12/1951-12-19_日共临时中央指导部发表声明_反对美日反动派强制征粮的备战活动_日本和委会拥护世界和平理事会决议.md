Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Tokyo delayed news: After the Yoshida reactionary government's attempt to abolish grain control failed due to the resolute opposition of the Japanese people, it attempted to intensify war preparations by intensifying grain collection under the instruction of Dodge, the financial advisor of the Ridgway headquarters. On November 3rd and 10th, the Temporary Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued two statements exposing this conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

The November 10th statement said: We demand the resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet. The Yoshida Cabinet must be held responsible for the failure of its policies. We cannot hand over state power to traitors who succumb to foreign financial advisors.

The statement pointed out: Whether it is Dodge or the Yoshida government, they all want to store grain for war preparations, force the Japanese people to buy foreign rice and wheat, make Japan subordinate to foreign countries, and destroy Japanese agriculture. Their policy remains unchanged.

The statement further pointed out: The strong resistance of the Japanese people is the reason for the failure of the Yoshida government's policy of abolishing grain control. This tremendous pressure from the Japanese people makes the invaders tremble and forces the Yoshida government to adopt other measures – the method proposed by Dodge of further strengthening control and using force to plunder huge amounts of rice from farmers.

The statement said: The Yoshida government's attempt to forcibly collect 25.5 million koku of rice is unbearable for Japanese rural areas, which are eking out a living in bankruptcy and hardship. We resolutely oppose the Yoshida government's traitorous policy of forced grain collection. Farmers across the country will rise up against this tyrannical rule of the Yoshida government for the freedom of agricultural management, the stability of life, and the independence of the motherland. The statement emphasized: The Yoshida government's policy of abolishing grain control has failed, and the policy of forced grain collection now formulated under foreign instructions will also fail. We must continue to strike at them. We must make them fail. Only by overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet can we destroy this brutal occupation system.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Tokyo delayed news: The Japanese Peace Committee held a meeting on November 20th and decided to endorse all the resolutions adopted by the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council. The meeting also decided to lodge a strong protest against the Japanese Diet's approval of the aggressive separate peace treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." At the same time, the meeting also passed a resolution on further developing the peace movement and uniformly publishing mass publications of the Peace Committee.

    日共临时中央指导部发表声明
    反对美日反动派强制征粮的备战活动
    日本和委会拥护世界和平理事会决议
    【新华社十六日讯】东京迟到消息：吉田反动政府撤销粮食管制的企图在日本人民坚决反对下失败后，在李奇微总部财政顾问道奇的指使下，又企图用加紧征粮的方式进行战争准备。十一月三日和十日，日本共产党临时中央指导部两次发表声明，揭露美、日反动派的这一阴谋。
    十一月十日的声明说：我们要求吉田内阁总辞职。吉田内阁对它的政策的失败，必须负责。我们不能够把国家政权交给在外国财政顾问面前屈服的卖国奴才。
    声明指出：无论道奇或者吉田政府，都是想要储存粮食进行备战，强迫日本人民购买外国米麦，使日本隶属于外国，破坏日本农业。它们的这一政策是始终不变的。
    声明进一步指出：日本人民的强烈反抗，是使吉田政府的撤销粮食管制政策失败的原因。日本人民的这种巨大的压力使侵略者战栗，迫使吉田政府采取别的办法——道奇所提出的进一步加强管制、用武力向农民掠夺巨额大米的办法。
    声明说：吉田政府企图强征二千五百五十万日石的大米，这是在破产和困苦的生活中残喘的日本农村所不堪负担的。我们坚决反对吉田政府强制征粮的卖国政策。全国农民为了经营农业的自由、生活的安定和祖国的独立，将奋起反对吉田政府的这种横暴统治。声明强调指出：吉田政府的撤销粮食管制政策失败了，现在根据外国的指使而制订的强制征粮政策也要失败。我们必须继续予以打击。我们必须使他们失败。唯有打倒吉田内阁，才能摧毁这个残暴的占领制度。
    【新华社十七日讯】东京迟到消息：日本拥护和平委员会在十一月二十日举行会议，决议拥护世界和平理事会维也纳会议所决定的各项决议。会议并决定对日本国会批准侵略性的单独和约和美日“安全条约”一事，提出强烈的抗议。同时，会议也通过了关于进一步发展和平运动和统一发行拥护和平委员会的群众性的出版物的决定。
