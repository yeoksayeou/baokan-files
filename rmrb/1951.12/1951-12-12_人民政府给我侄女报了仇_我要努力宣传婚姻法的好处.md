    The People's Government Avenged My Niece
    I Will Strive to Promote the Benefits of the Marriage Law
    I was truly happy to hear the news of Wang Wenzhi's death sentence being reaffirmed. The heinous Wang Wenzhi deserved to be shot long ago. My niece, Gu Guangzhen's marriage was arranged by our family. Not long after Wang Wenzhi married my niece, he raped Wang Yonglan, a girl from our village. Wang Wenzhi and his mother said they would torment my niece bit by bit to death so that he could live with Wang Yonglan. Thus, he usually didn't give my niece enough to eat. When she wanted to rest while working in the fields, Wang Wenzhi would pick up a hoe and hit her on the back. At night, she had to feed the livestock three times. Once, a cat broke a plate, but Wang Wenzhi insisted that my niece had broken it, and asked her, "Do you admit to being beaten or fined?" Admitting to being beaten meant being branded with a red-hot iron poker, admitting to a fine meant kneeling in the livestock shed facing a blind mule for three days. When my niece was giving birth, she was placed in a room that no one had ever lived in, and the child died after being born. During my niece's postpartum period, he didn't give her water to drink and the porridge he cooked was always raw. When my niece was very ill, he didn't seek treatment for her. Later, we spent money to find a doctor, but because the illness was too severe, she couldn't be cured and died. Before liberation, we wanted to avenge ourselves on Wang Wenzhi, but Wang Wenzhi was a Kuomintang member and also the head of the village, who could afford to offend him? Today, we have the People's Government, and the Marriage Law has been promulgated, avenging my niece. I am truly grateful to Chairman Mao! I will properly promote the Marriage Law so that our women can be completely liberated and stand up. Zhang Gushi (recorded by Dai Liqun)

    人民政府给我侄女报了仇
    我要努力宣传婚姻法的好处
    我听到重新判决王文治死刑的消息，心里真高兴。对万恶滔天的王文治早就该枪毙。我侄女顾广珍的婚事是我们家里给包办的。王文治娶了我侄女没多少日子，就把我们村的姑娘王永兰给强奸了。王文治和他妈说，要一点一点的给我侄女气受，把她弄死，他好带王永兰过日子。这样，平常日子不给我侄女饱饭吃，她在地里干活想歇一下，王文治拿起镐头照脊背就打，夜里还要她喂三回牲口。有一回，猫砸了一个碟子，王文治硬说我侄女砸的，便问她“你认打还是认罚”，认打就是拿烧红的火筷子往身上烫，认罚就在牲口棚里向瞎骡子跪三天。在我侄女生小孩子的时候，把她放在一间从来没人住的房子里，小孩生下之后就死了。我侄女坐月子时，他不给她水喝，给熬的粥米都是生的。当我侄女病得很重时，他也不给治。后来由我们花钱找大夫，因为病很重，所以治不好死了。在解放前我们想找王文治报仇，但王文治是国民党员又是甲长，谁惹得起他呀。今天有了人民政府，又颁布了婚姻法，给我侄女报了仇。我真感谢毛主席！我要好好宣传婚姻法，让我们妇女都彻底解放翻身。张顾氏口述（戴力群笔录）
