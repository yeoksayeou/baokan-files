Xinhua News Agency, December 27th dispatch from Moscow: The "Pravda" published an article on the 5th by its New York correspondents, Filippov and Litoshko, describing the plight of the American working people due to the expansion of armaments.

Filippov and Litoshko wrote: The arms expansion movement has brought mythical profits to American monopoly capital. However, the more the oil magnates, coal magnates, steel magnates, and arms manufacturers profit, the more difficult the situation becomes for American workers. The war economy weighs heavily on their shoulders, bringing destitution and bankruptcy, further accelerating the impoverishment of the American people. Even according to the most conservative estimates, since the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, the cost of maintaining a minimum standard of living in the United States has increased by at least 25 percent. Due to the wild rise in prices, inflation, and the further impoverishment of the American people, food consumption is constantly declining. For example, according to official data from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics for the period of July to September this year, compared to the average from 1935 to 1939, lamb consumption decreased by 56 percent, butter consumption decreased by 41 percent, and beef consumption decreased by 14 percent.

The continuous impoverishment of the American people is also reflected in the fact that American workers cannot even afford the most needed clothes. The U.S. Department of Commerce admitted in a recent survey: "The proportion of American families' wages spent on clothing is now smaller than at any time since 1929. Food, rent, and taxes take up all the wages of ordinary Americans, leaving little or no money for other purposes. From November 1st, the family budgets of American workers have become even tighter, as taxes have increased by more than 11 percent again. Milk prices, train fares, cigarette prices, and household furniture prices have all risen again. Even the leaders of the American war economy agencies, Wilson and Johnston, recently admitted that the minimum cost of living will rise by another 6 to 8 percent within a year. Every 1 percent increase in the cost of living means that $2 billion is squeezed from the pockets of the workers, while Morgan, DuPont, Rockefeller, Mellon, and other billionaires—this small group of insatiable plutocrats—make a fortune from it.

At the same time, a new army of unemployed is growing. In September alone, the army of unemployed increased by one million. Cold, hard facts and vivid reality repeatedly prove that the militarization of the economy brings continuous suffering and poverty to American workers.

Filippov and Litoshko concluded: More and more ordinary Americans have begun to realize that this period of suffering is the result of the American ruling group's implementation of an open policy of aggression, the result of a frantic expansion of armaments, and the result of the insatiable greed of Wall Street's imperialist plunderers—who see war and the militarization of the economy as an inexhaustible source of profit.

### 美反动统治集团疯狂扩军  美国人民生活更贫穷  失业大军九月份就增加了一百万

    美反动统治集团疯狂扩军
    美国人民生活更贫穷
    失业大军九月份就增加了一百万
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”五日刊载该报驻纽约记者费利波夫和李托希科的文章，叙述美国因扩充军备而使劳动人民生活穷困的情形。
    费利波夫和李托希科写道：扩充军备运动给美国垄断资本带来了神话般的利润。可是，石油大王、煤炭大王、钢铁大王和军火制造商获利越多，美国劳动者的处境就越困难。战争经济沉重地压在他们的肩头上，带来赤贫和破产，更加加速了美国人民大众的贫穷化。甚至根据最保守的估计，自美国帝国主义者发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，美国维持最低限度的生活所需的费用至少增加了百分之二十五。由于物价疯狂上涨、通货膨胀和美国人民大众的进一步贫穷化，食品的消费量不断下降。例如，根据农业经济局今年七月至九月这一时期的正式材料，与一九三五—一九三九年平均额比较，羊肉的消费量减少了百分之五十六，奶油的消费量减少了百分之四十一，牛肉的消费量减少了百分之十四。
    美国人民大众的生活的不断的贫穷化还表现在：美国工人连最需要的衣服也买不起了。美国商务部在最近的调查中承认：“美国家庭现在购买衣服的费用在他们的工资中占的比例较一九二九年以来任何时候都要小。饭费、房租和捐税占了普通美国人的全部工资，剩不下一点点钱供其他的用途。从十一月一日起，美国工人的家庭预算更拮据了，因为捐税又增加了百分之十一以上。牛奶价、铁路票价、烟价、家用家具的价格等再度上涨。甚至美国战争经济机关的领导人威尔生和蒋士顿，不久以前都承认，最低限度的生活费在一年内还要上涨百分之六至百分之八。生活费每上涨百分之一，就意味着有二十亿美元从劳动者的口袋里被榨取去了，而摩根、杜邦、洛克菲勒、梅隆以及其他的亿万富翁、这一小撮贪得无厌的财阀即因此大发其财。
    同时，新的失业军正在增长着。仅九月份一个月，失业大军就增加了一百万人。冷酷的生活事实、活生生的现实一再证明，经济的军事化带给美国劳动者不断的苦难和贫穷。
    费利波夫和李托希科最后写道：越来越多的普通美国人已开始认识到，目前这个苦难的时期是美国统治集团执行公开侵略政策的结果，是疯狂地扩充军备的结果，是华尔街的帝国主义掠夺者贪得无厌的结果——他们把战争和经济的军事化看成是利润的不竭的源泉。
