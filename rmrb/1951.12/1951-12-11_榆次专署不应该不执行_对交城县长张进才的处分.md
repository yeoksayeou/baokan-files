To the Editor:

The case of Zhang Jincai, County Head of Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, and others concealing and squandering state property, causing a loss of 712,800 jin of millet to the state, which was published in the People's Daily on October 17th, was investigated and handled by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Supervisory Committee. It was proposed to give him the punishment of dismissal from his post, and after being agreed by the Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, it was submitted to the Central Supervisory Committee for review and approval. On September 8th, an order was received from the State Council of the Central People's Government, approving the dismissal of Zhang Jincai. On September 27th, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government ordered the Yuci Special District to implement it conscientiously. However, it has been more than two months now, and the Yuci Special District has not yet implemented it. According to reports from personnel sent by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Supervisory Committee, the Yuci Special District not only did not punish Zhang Jincai, but instead promoted Zhang Jincai to work in the Financial and Economic Committee of the Yuci Special District. This is a conscious act of shielding. The masses are extremely dissatisfied with this matter. They said, "When big cadres break the law, it's just talk and then it's over." Hou, the Deputy Director of the People's Supervisory Office of the Yuci Special District, has repeatedly raised objections to this matter, but it has not been effective. We believe that the phenomenon of leading cadres in the Yuci Special District disregarding laws and discipline and neglecting government orders is quite serious. What is the attitude of the Yuci Special District towards national policies and decisions from higher authorities? What opinions do they have? Why do they neglect and ignore them? They should review this kind of thinking and action.

    榆次专署不应该不执行
    对交城县长张进才的处分
    编辑同志：人民日报十月十七日登载的山西省交城县县长张进才等隐匿、挥霍国家财产，使国家损失小米七十一万二千八百多斤一案，经山西省人民政府监察委员会调查处理，拟定给予撤职处分，并经山西省人民政府主席同意，又呈请中央监察委员会核示。九月八日，接到中央人民政府政务院命令，批准给予张进才撤职处分。九月二十七日，山西省人民政府令榆次专署切实执行。但是，到现在已经两月多了，榆次专署还没有执行。据山西省人民政府人民监察委员会派员查报，榆次专署对张进才不但没有处分，反而把张进才提到榆次专署财政经济委员会工作。这是有意识的包庇行为。群众对这件事极为不满，他们说：“大干部犯法，只是说说就算完事。”榆次专署人民监察处侯副主任对这事一再提出反对意见，也没有生效。我们认为，榆次专署领导干部藐视法纪、玩忽政令的现象，是相当严重的。倒底榆次专署对国家政策、对上级决定采取什么态度？有什么意见？为什么玩忽不管？他们对这种思想、行动，应该加以检讨。
