    Denouncing the US Government's New Conspiracy to Persecute Hall
    After the reactionary US government, with the help of its lackey, the Mexican government, illegally arrested the Secretary of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, Hall, in the Mexican capital in October this year, it is now using the pretext of so-called "contempt of court" to conduct a new illegal trial of Hall in Foley Square, New York, and is plotting to impose a new prison sentence on Hall.
    The persecution of the American Communist Party and the progressive forces of the American people by the US reactionary government is a consistent trick of oppressing the American working people and promoting war policies. As early as October 1949, the US Federal Court in New York illegally sentenced eleven American Communist leaders, including Dennis and Hall, to prison on the charge of so-called "incitement to subvert the US government by violence." Since the start of the US invasion of Korea in June last year, the US government's persecution of the American Communist Party has become even more intensified; a large number of leading cadres of the American Communist Party have been arrested throughout the country.
    The American Communist Party is the faithful defender of the interests of the American working class and the American people. In the past year or more, in order to stop the bloody US aggression against Korea and maintain peace in the Far East and the world, the American Communist Party has continuously exposed the aggressive nature of the US government to the American people and explained the serious harm of the Korean War to the American people. Hall, Secretary of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, proposed the idea of ​​stopping the Korean War a year ago. Under the call and leadership of the American Communist Party, the American people have gradually awakened and are taking increasingly powerful actions to strive for peace. This is naturally a very significant blow to the aggressive policy of American imperialism.
    In the incident of persecuting Hall, the US government blatantly revealed its fascist face. In July of this year, the US government investigated the Civil Rights Congress, which paid Hall's bail, and imprisoned the Civil Rights Congress leaders, Mr. Field, Mr. Collin, and Dr. Hanton. Now it is plotting to impose a new prison sentence on Hall. This practice of the US government completely violates all legal precedents and is a further destruction and deprivation of the democratic rights of the American people. This shows that the US government is not only an enemy of the cause of peace, but also the most tyrannical fascist government in American history.
    This reactionary measure of the US government is bound to be strongly opposed by the American people and all righteous people in the world. The US government's attempt to stifle the American people's struggle for peace and democracy by persecuting the American Communist Party and the American Communist leaders is a despicable means that can never be realized. Because the fact is very clear, if imperialism wants to carry out aggression, the people will definitely oppose its aggression; as long as the threat of war exists, the people will not stop their struggle for a single day. We firmly believe that neither the reactionary Smith Act nor the prisons of the New York Federal Court can suppress or imprison the American people's will to defend peace under the leadership of the American Communist Party, but can only make them more clearly recognize the aggressive face of American imperialism, and use more resolute and powerful actions to strike it.

### 斥美国政府对霍尔的新的迫害阴谋

    斥美国政府对霍尔的新的迫害阴谋
    美国反动政府在今年十月九日借其走狗墨西哥政府之助，在墨西哥首都非法逮捕了美共全国委员会书记霍尔以后，现在正以所谓“藐视法院罪”的藉口，在纽约福莱广场对霍尔进行新的非法审讯，并阴谋对霍尔加判新的徒刑。
    美国政府对于美国共产党与美国人民进步力量的迫害，是它们压迫美国劳动人民与推行战争政策的一贯伎俩。早在一九四九年十月，美国纽约联邦法院就以所谓“教唆以暴力颠覆美国政府”的罪名，非法地对美共领袖但尼斯、霍尔等十一人分别判以徒刑。自去年六月美国侵朝战争开始以后，美国政府对于美国共产党的迫害更为变本加厉；美共领导干部在全国各地大批地遭到逮捕。
    美国共产党是美国工人阶级与美国人民利益的忠实的保卫者，最近一年多来，为了制止美国对于朝鲜的血腥侵略，以保持远东与世界的和平，美国共产党曾不断地向美国人民揭露美国政府的侵略本质，并说明朝鲜战争对于美国人民的严重危害性。美共全国委员会书记霍尔在一年以前就提出了要求停止朝鲜战争的主张。在美国共产党的号召与领导之下，美国人民已逐渐觉醒，并且日益有力地行动起来争取和平。这对于美帝国主义的侵略政策自然是一个十分重大的打击。
    在迫害霍尔的事件中，美国政府露骨地表现了它的法西斯面目。今年七月间，美国政府曾对为霍尔缴纳保释金的民权保障大会进行调查，并将民权保障大会的负责人费尔德、哥林和韩顿博士下狱。现在又阴谋对霍尔加判新的徒刑。美国政府的这种做法，完全违反了一切法律的先例，是对美国人民民主权利进一步的破坏与剥夺。这就显示出美国政府不但是和平事业的敌人，而且也是美国历史上最蛮横的法西斯政府。
    美国政府的这种反动措施，必然要遭受到美国人民与全世界正义人士的强烈反对。美国政府企图以迫害美国共产党和美共领袖的卑劣手段，来窒息美国人民争取和平民主斗争的目的，是永远不能实现的。因为事实是十分明显的，帝国主义要实行侵略，人民就一定会反对它的侵略；战争的威胁存在一天，人民就一天也不会停止他们的斗争。我们深信，无论是反动的史密斯法案或者是纽约联邦法院的监狱，都不能够抑制或禁锢美国人民在美共领导下保卫和平的意志，而只能使他们更加认清美帝国主义的侵略面目，而以更坚决有力的行动来打击它。
