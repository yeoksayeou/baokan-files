Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: Shi Anfu, a farmer in Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, achieved a yield of 810 jin per mu of wheat this year. Shi Anfu's achievement in high yield is of great significance for increasing the yield per unit area of grain in our country. In order to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and summarize Shi Anfu's experience in high-yield wheat production, the Northwest Branch and Shaanxi Branch of this Agency specially invited Zhao Hongzhang and Xu Zhilu, wheat experts from the Wugong Agricultural Experiment Station and Northwest Agricultural College, and Wu Shouren, a soil and fertilizer expert, and dispatched reporters Wu Yusen, Wang Zongxi, and Liu Bin to Hancheng to conduct on-the-spot investigations and research. Shen Yuqing from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, Cao Jinglun from the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Feng Yunzhang from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Zhang Jian'an from the Dali Agricultural Work Station, Yang Fan from the Hancheng County Construction Section, and Li Yukui from the Hancheng County Farm also participated in this investigation and summary work. At that time, in order to carry out the work in a unified manner, we merged and formed the "Shi Anfu Wheat High-Yield Investigation Team." The following is the report of the investigation team.

I. Verification of Field Area and Yield

    Shi Anfu, a liberated farmer in Nanjiannan Village, Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, planted 1.85 mu of irrigated wheat last autumn, and this year the yield reached 810 jin per mu, which is about 500 jin higher than the average yield of irrigated wheat in the area. His wheat field yields two crops a year, with corn planted before the wheat. This year, the harvest of corn per mu also reached 775 jin.

    During this investigation, we first measured his two wheat fields with standard market rulers. One piece was 1.43 mu, and the other was 0.52 mu, totaling 1.95 mu. After deducting 0.05 mu occupied by irrigation ditches in the field and 0.05 mu planted with cabbage, the actual wheat planting area was 1.85 mu. Next, we verified Shi Anfu's wheat harvest this year. In addition to interviewing him personally, we also interviewed Ruan Sanhe, a farmer who jointly threshed and measured the grain with him, Yang Taoran, the director of the village farmers' association who led the summer harvest and selection in the entire village, as well as township and village cadres and farmers. Everyone unanimously confirmed that Shi Anfu's 1.85 mu wheat field harvested a total of 1,498 jin of wheat this year, with a yield of 810 jin per mu.

        II. Introduction to Shi Anfu's Wheat Planting Techniques

    Shi Anfu's wheat planting, from land preparation to harvesting, a series of cultivation techniques are in line with scientific principles. The "Red Geda" wheat he originally planted was a good wheat variety with a high yield. However, this wheat is prone to lodging and jaundice in conditions of heavy fertilizer and sufficient water. Last year, he changed to planting "Biyu" wheat. Biyu wheat also has a high yield, is fertilizer-resistant, has hard stalks that are not easy to lodge, and is also resistant to jaundice and does not shed grains.

    Before sowing, Shi Anfu prepared the land very carefully. After harvesting the previous crop of corn, he collected the remaining corn stalks and leaves and weeds on the ground and burned them as fertilizer. Then, he used a harrow to break up the hard ground, level the soil piles on the corn roots, and irrigated it once. After a few days of watering, when the weeds sprouted, he used a shovel to turn the soil, turning it eight inches deep, burying the weeds underground. Turning the soil with a shovel is not only deep, but also consistent in depth, and the topsoil is flat, which can make the soil fertility uniform. After turning the soil, Shi Anfu spread basal fertilizer, shallowly cultivated it once with a plow without a moldboard, harrowed it twice, and dragged it once with a clod breaker. After a few days, he shallowly cultivated it again and dragged it once, and then he could sow. Such repeated cultivation and dragging made the soil even and fine, not loose and not too compact, retained water well, the wheat seeds easily germinated, and the wheat roots easily penetrated deeply. Last year, Shi Anfu planted wheat seven days before the Cold Dew solar term. The sowing method was to first open a two-inch deep and one-and-a-half-inch wide ditch, with a ditch spacing of eight inches, and then use his hands to sow the wheat seeds into the ditch, cover them with soil, and level it with a clod breaker. Shi Anfu sowed 17 jin of wheat seeds per mu, scattering them by hand, and the sowing width of each row was very wide and dense. Under conditions of heavy fertilizer and sufficient water, sowing more seeds and widening the sowing width of each row (the width of sowing) is an important method for increasing wheat production. After sowing, he used a scraper to scrape up the floating soil and made the wheat field into small plots (about one square zhang) for irrigation. The local area uses stream water for irrigation, and the water volume is small. He adopted the small plot irrigation method, which has three advantages: First, the irrigation is uniform and the water is used economically; second, the fertilizer in the plot is not easily washed away by water, nor is it easy to lose nutrients; third, it can suit his principle of timely irrigation. In the middle of winter, Shi Anfu paid great attention to the protection of seedlings in the wheat field. Before the ground froze, he would hoe it once, and after the ground froze, he would irrigate it once with "freezing water." Watering freezing water can prevent spring drought and prevent wheat seedlings from freezing. "Heavy fertilizer and sufficient water" is Shi Anfu's characteristic of growing crops. His wheat field was fertilized with about 12,000 jin per mu when planting corn in the previous crop, and the land was very fertile. However, when planting wheat, he also applied 24 jin of black bean flour as basal fertilizer. After watering freezing water, he also spread 6,000 jin of soil manure (a mixture of soil, coal ash, and human and animal manure) per mu of wheat field as top dressing. The fertilizer applied this time can not only timely supply the needs of wheat growth in spring, but also cover the wheat field and reduce frost damage. After the Qingming Festival in the second year, when the wheat was about to spike, in order to supply the needs of wheat grain formation, he applied another 6,000 jin of soil manure per mu of wheat field.

    From thawing to harvesting in the second year, Shi Anfu hoed the wheat field twice, watered it four times, and also paid attention to removing weeds in the field at any time. The management was very careful. Stream water irrigation contains many weed seeds, and weeds easily grow in the field; therefore, Shi Anfu hoed the first time at the beginning of spring (after the Spring Equinox). Because spring is very cold, in order to avoid ventilation of the soil and freezing the wheat roots, he also dragged it once after hoeing. About 20 days later, he hoed it a second time, and then paid attention to removing the weeds between the wheat plants at any time. His wheat field was always very clean. As for the four irrigations, the first time was after applying the second top dressing. This irrigation can dissolve the fertilizer and supply the needs of wheat heading. In May, the weather gradually became hot, the ground evaporated quickly, and the wheat needed a lot of water, so Shi Anfu irrigated it three times in a row: once in early May, once around May 20, and once at the end of May. At that time, it was the peak period of wheat grain filling, and such continuous irrigation can make the wheat grains develop fully. After that, Shi Anfu stopped watering. He said: After the wheat turns slightly yellow, watering will harm the wheat and the grain formation will not be good. As for harvesting the wheat, because Biyu wheat does not have the problem of shedding grains, Shi Anfu harvested it this year on June 14th of the Gregorian calendar after the wheat was fully ripe. Therefore, his wheat grains were very full.

        III. Analysis of Shi Anfu's Wheat Planting Techniques

    Hancheng County has a small amount of land and a large population near the city, and the labor force is sufficient. Farmers have the habit of intensive cultivation. Shi Anfu's cultivation is more refined than that of ordinary farmers in the area. He not only puts in a lot of effort in farming, but also studies technology very carefully. This is the reason why he achieved a high wheat yield. However, Shi Anfu was not like this before liberation. His family of seven had two laborers, and at that time they only had 0.3 mu of dry land that could not be irrigated; they rented 1.95 mu of irrigated land, and had to pay 70% of the harvest to the landlord every year. At that time, he not only had no intention of studying technology, but also had no ability to study it, and no one guided him. Last year, Hancheng implemented land reform, and Shi Anfu was allocated these irrigated lands that he had cultivated for many years, and his enthusiasm for increasing production for the country was greatly increased. At the same time, he also received technical guidance from the Hancheng County Farm (Biyu wheat was introduced to him by the farm), and his confidence in increasing production was also strengthened. Although he has only just been liberated, there are still many difficulties in production. However, he overcame these difficulties with a hundredfold surge of patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production. For example, he did not have any draft animals when planting wheat last year (this year, the People's Government has loaned him a donkey). He himself carried the ropes and dragged the harrow and clod breaker to harrow the land, and harrowed it once more than ordinary farmers with draft animals. In order to increase fertilizer application in the wheat field, he opened a tofu workshop and raised eight pigs under extremely difficult conditions. This year, he applied twice as much fertilizer to the wheat field as in the past. Shi Anfu's high-yield facts fully prove the rapid development of agricultural productivity in our country after liberation. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Shi Anfu's wheat yield per mu was only 300 jin. In 1949, the year of liberation, it was 650 jin, and this year it reached more than 800 jin.

    Shi Anfu's high-yield experience once again proves that the dense planting experience in Soviet agriculture is an important method for increasing crop yields. Can wheat be densely planted? Shi Anfu's experience answers: Yes, wheat must be densely planted to achieve high yields. The row spacing of wheat needs to be wide, so how can wheat be densely planted? Shi Anfu answers: Wheat dense planting is not to narrow the row spacing, but to widen the width and density of sowing in each row. Farmers in many places only use about 10 jin of wheat seeds per mu, and each row is sown very thinly and sparsely. However, Shi Anfu uses 17 jin of wheat seeds per mu, and the sowing width of each row is very wide and sown very densely. Widening the sowing width of each row of wheat is an extremely important experience for fully utilizing the soil fertility and increasing the yield per unit area of wheat. All parts of the country should give sufficient attention to this experience and promote it.

    Shi Anfu's wheat cultivation is indeed somewhat higher than the level of ordinary farmers in the area. His wheat field has a large amount of fertilizer applied, and the quality is good. Ordinary farmers only apply top dressing to the wheat field once, while he applies it twice. In cultivation: Ordinary farmers cultivate four or five inches, while he uses a shovel to turn the soil and deeply cultivate eight inches; ordinary farmers cultivate twice, harrow and drag once each, while he cultivates three times, and harrows and drags twice each. Ordinary farmers only weed the wheat field once, while he hoes and pulls weeds a total of five times. Ordinary wheat fields have little fertilizer and can only be watered two or three times. "Watering one more time will ruin nine out of ten" (ruin means reduced production). Shi Anfu broke the old habits, applied a large amount of fertilizer, and watered five times.

    Shi Anfu's high-yield experience proves that to increase the yield per unit crop, various farming practices must be well combined. For example: If fertilizer application and watering are not well combined, not only will it not fully exert its due role, but it may even reduce wheat production. Shi Anfu understands that increasing production requires a large amount of fertilizer application, so he selected the fertilizer-resistant Biyu wheat. He removes all weeds before each fertilization to prevent the weeds from stealing nutrients; he waters immediately after fertilization to promote fertilizer decomposition. He has made all the factors that increase production play a high role. He waters thoroughly and applies basal fertilizer before sowing in order to make the wheat seeds germinate quickly, take root deeply, and tiller more. He waters "freezing water" and applies top dressing in winter in order to protect the seedlings from the cold, store water, and decompose the fertilizer over the winter for use by the wheat after it starts growing in the coming spring. Generally, crops suffer a little drought during the seedling stage, and drought can promote the development of fibrous roots and enhance the ability to absorb water and fertilizer. However, if wheat suffers from drought before winter, it will hinder tillering and reduce yield. Therefore, Shi Anfu waters before sowing and waters again when it freezes to avoid affecting tillering. However, after that, he waits until the second top dressing in the second year before watering again. This watering time is about seven days later than that of local farmers in order to allow the wheat to develop fibrous roots.

    Hancheng has a warm climate, but Shi Anfu's Nanjiannan Village is in a mountain valley, and there are many northwest winds in spring, so the spring is longer and colder, and there is a saying that "spring is cold but winter is not cold." The local soil is black loam, with a thick soil layer, loose soil texture, and good water permeability and ventilation. Shi Anfu's cultivation methods are also well combined with these two natural conditions. The Biyu wheat he plants is afraid of cold, and the cold spring is an unfavorable condition. This autumn, he postponed the wheat planting time by a few days. In this way, the wheat will start growing later in the coming spring to avoid frost damage in spring (too late is not good, it will affect wheat tillering). Ordinary farmers are afraid of the wheat roots freezing and do not dare to hoe the land early; Shi Anfu created a method of dragging it once after hoeing, so he dares to hoe it early, so that a series of subsequent farming practices can be carried out on time. Because the spring cold stream water is cold, and water cannot be poured in the spring, he used the method of pouring "frozen water." Because the soil is loose and permeable, and wheat needs a lot of water in the later stage, he used the method of watering more. In order to avoid the loss of too much fertilizer, he applied top dressing twice. In short, Shi Anfu has many creations to adapt to the local natural conditions.

        IV. Some Suggestions

    Based on this year's experience, if Shi Anfu further improves his fertilization, sowing, and seed selection techniques, and changes to using new farm implements, his wheat yield per unit area will be further increased; for example, increasing the application of quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer, changing to planting cold-resistant and high-yield wheat varieties, paying attention to seed selection in the field, and so on. Shi Anfu's fertilizer used this year did not have enough nitrogen fertilizer. If he applies some fertilizer powder during the heading stage, it will not only increase wheat yield, but also improve the quality of wheat. The Biyu wheat he planted this year is afraid of cold, and according to past experience, the high-yield potential of Biyu wheat is not large enough, and it is not resistant to wheat midges. Therefore, Shi Anfu can also try planting Bima No. 4 wheat or other wheat varieties that are resistant to wheat midges.

    Shi Anfu only formed a mutual aid group with three other farmers this year. In the future, on the basis of organizing themselves, further improving technology and using new farm implements is the direction for further increasing the yield per unit area. This year, Shi Anfu still used a shovel to turn the soil and sowed by hand. If he used a new step plow and an improved drilling machine, the increase in production would be much better.

    史安福小麦丰产调查报告
    史安福小麦丰产调查团
    新华社按：陕西省韩城县农民史安福的小麦，今年每市亩产量达到八百一十市斤。史安福的这一丰产成就，对于提高我国粮食单位面积产量有很大意义。为了实地调查和总结史安福小麦丰产经验，本社西北总分社和陕西分社特邀请了武功农业试验场和西北农学院小麦专家赵洪璋、许志鲁，土壤肥料专家吴守仁等，并派遣记者吴玉森、王宗西、刘斌前往韩城，作实地的调查和研究。中央人民政府农业部沈煜清、西北农林部曹经伦、陕西省农林厅冯云璋、大荔农业工作站张建安、韩城县建设科杨范和韩城县农场李玉魁等，也参加了这次调查和总结工作。当时，为着统一进行工作，我们合并组成了“史安福小麦丰产调查团”。下面就是调查团的报告。一、查实田亩和产量
    陕西省韩城县南涧南村翻身农民史安福，去年秋天播种一市亩八分五厘水地小麦，今年每亩产量达八百一十市斤，比当地一般水地小麦的产量高出约五百斤。他的麦田每年两作，麦前种的是玉蜀黍，今年收麦后又种了玉蜀黍。今年，每亩玉蜀黍的收获量，也达到七百七十五市斤。
    这次调查，我们用标准市尺先丈量了他的两块麦地。一块是一市亩四分三厘，一块是五分二厘，共计一市亩九分五厘。除去田间引水沟占地五厘，播种白菜地五厘外，种麦面积实际上是一市亩八分五厘。接着，我们又核对史安福今年的小麦收获量。我们除访问他本人外，还访问过和他合伙打场、量斗的农民阮三合，领导全村夏收夏选的村农会主任杨陶然，以及乡、村干部和农民。大家一致证实：史安福的一亩八分五厘麦田，今年共收小麦一千四百九十八斤，每亩产量合八百一十市斤。
        二、史安福种麦技术介绍
    史安福种麦，从整地到收割一系列的耕作技术都是合乎科学原理的。他原来种的“红疙瘩”小麦，是一种产量高的好麦种。但是，这种麦在粪大水足的情况下容易倒伏，容易发生黄疸，去年他就改种了“碧玉”麦。碧玉麦的产量也高，能耐肥，秆硬不易倒伏，还能抗黄疸，不落粒。
    播种以前的整地，史安福做得很精细。前作玉蜀黍收获后，他就把地上遗留的玉蜀黍茎叶和杂草收起来烧掉，充作肥料。然后，他用耙把坚硬的地面耙破，把玉蜀黍根上的土堆耙平，浇灌一次。待浇后几天，杂草发芽后，他便用锨翻地，深翻八寸，把杂草埋入地下。用锨翻地，不但深，而且深度一致，表土平整，可使土壤肥力均匀。翻地后，史安福就撒布基肥，用不带犁面的犁浅耕一遍，耙两遍，耱一遍。再过几天，又浅耕一次，耱一次，就可以播种了。这样反复耕耱，把土壤弄得均匀细碎，不虚不实，保水良好，麦种容易发芽，麦根容易深扎。去年，史安福种麦在寒露前七天。播种的方法是先开两寸深一寸半宽的沟，沟距八寸，然后用手把麦种播入沟内，盖土耱平。史安福给每亩麦田播麦种十七斤，用手撒播，每行的播幅很宽而且很密。在粪大水足的条件下，多播种子，加宽每行的播幅（播种的宽度），是小麦增产的重要办法。播种后，他就用刮板刮起浮土，把麦田作成一块一块的小畦（约一方丈），以便灌水。当地是用涧水灌溉，水量较小，他采用小畦灌溉法有三个好处：第一、灌水均匀，用水经济；第二、畦内肥料不易被水冲积，也不易流失养分；第三、可以适合他的及时灌水的原则。冬季中间，史安福很注意麦田的护苗工作。地冻前他要锄一次，地冻后他又要浇灌一次“结冻水”。浇结冻水可以防止春旱，又可以防止麦苗受冻。“粪大水足”是史安福种庄稼的特点。他的麦田在前作种玉蜀黍时，每亩施肥约一万二千斤，地很肥。但是，种麦时，他还要上二十四斤黑豆粉作基肥。浇结冻水以后，他又要给每亩麦田撒布六千斤土粪（泥土、煤灰和人畜粪的混合肥料）作追肥。这次所施肥料，不但能及时供应春季小麦生长的需要，还能覆盖麦田，减轻冻害。第二年清明节后小麦快吐穗的时候，为了供应小麦结实的需要，他又给每亩麦田上了六千斤土粪。
    第二年从解冻到收麦，史安福前后要锄两次麦地，浇四次水，还随时注意拔除田间的杂草，管理是很精细的。涧水灌田，水中草籽很多，田间易生杂草；所以一开春（春分后）史安福就锄第一遍。因为春天很冷，为避免土壤透风，冻伤麦根，锄后他还要耱一遍。大概过二十天后他又要锄第二次，再以后便随时注意拔除麦株之间的杂草。他的麦田经常是很干净的。至于四次浇灌，第一次是在上第二次追肥之后。这次浇水可使肥料溶解，供给小麦抽穗的需要。五月天气渐热，地面蒸发快，小麦需水多，史安福便连续浇三次水：五月初一次，五月二十日前后一次，五月底一次。当时是小麦灌浆盛期，这样连续浇灌，可使麦粒发育充实。再以后，史安福便不再浇水了。他说：麦稍发黄以后，浇了水反会使小麦遭受损害，结实不好。至于收麦，因为碧玉麦没有落粒的毛病，史安福今年是在阳历六月十四日小麦透熟以后才割的。因此他的麦子麦粒都很饱满。
        三、史安福种麦技术分析
    韩城县城附近地少人多，劳力充足，农民有精耕细作的习惯。史安福的耕作比当地一般农民更加精细。他种地不只是肯下力，还很用心钻研技术。这是他获得小麦丰收的原因。但是，解放以前史安福并不是这样的。他全家七口人，两个劳动力，那时候只有三分不能浇灌的旱地；租种一亩九分五厘水地，每年要把收获量的百分之七十缴给地主。那时候他不只无心钻研技术，也无力钻研，没人指导。去年韩城实行土地改革，史安福分得了他耕种了多年的这些水地，爱国增产的热情大大地提高了。同时，他还得到韩城县农场的技术指导（碧玉麦就是农场介绍给他的），增产信心也加强了。虽然他才翻身，生产还有很多困难。但是，他以百倍高涨的爱国增产热情克服了这些困难。比如去年种麦时他没有耕畜（今年，人民政府已贷给了他一头驴子），耙地耱地都是他自己背上套绳曳耙曳耱，还比一般有耕畜的农民多耙耱了一遍。为了给麦田增施肥料，他在极端困难的条件下开设了豆腐坊，养了八只猪。今年，他给麦田施的肥比过去多了一倍。史安福丰产的事实，完全证明了我国农业生产力解放后的飞速发展。抗战前史安福的小麦的每亩产量不过三百斤，一九四九年解放那年是六百五十斤，今年就达到了八百多斤。
    史安福的丰产经验，又一次证明了苏联农业上的密植经验，是提高农作物产量的重要办法。小麦可不可以密植呢？史安福的经验解答说：可以，小麦要丰产也要密植。小麦的行距需要得宽，那么小麦怎样密植呢？史安福解答说：小麦密植不是缩小行距，而是加宽每行播种的宽度和密度。好些地方的农民种一亩小麦只用十斤左右麦种，每行都播得很细很稀。但是史安福每亩要用十七斤麦种，每行的播幅都很宽，播得很密。加宽麦田每行的播幅，是充分发挥地力，提高小麦单位面积产量的极其重要的经验。全国各地对这个经验都应予以足够的重视，加以推广。
    史安福种麦的作务，确实比当地一般农民的水平高一些。他的麦田施肥数量多，质量好。一般农民只给麦田上追肥一次，他上两次。耕作上：一般农民耕四、五寸，他用锨翻地深耕八寸；一般耕两次，耙、耱各一次，他耕三次，耙、耱各两次。一般农民麦田只锄一次草，他连锄带拔共五次。一般麦田肥少，只能浇两三次水，“多浇一水，十有九瞎”（瞎是减产的意思）。史安福打破旧有习惯，大量施肥，浇水五次。
    史安福的丰产经验证明，要增加单位作物产量，必须把各种作务结合得很好。比如说：施肥和浇水如果结合不好，不但不能充分发挥应有的作用，甚至会使小麦减产。史安福懂得增产必须大量施肥，便选种了耐肥的碧玉麦。他每次施肥前都要除尽杂草，以免杂草窃夺养料；施肥后都要立即浇水，以促进肥料分解。他使一切增加生产的因素都高度地发挥了作用。他在播种前浇透水和施基肥，是为了使麦种发芽快，扎根深，分蘖多。他浇“结冻水”和在冬季施追肥，是为了防寒保苗，贮积水分，并使肥料经冬分解，供给来春小麦起身后使用。一般作物幼苗期稍受些旱，旱可促使须根发达，增强吸水吸肥的能力。但是小麦在冬前如果受旱就要妨碍分蘖，减少产量。所以，史安福在播种前要浇水，封冻时又要浇水，不使影响分蘖。但是，这以后，他便要等第二年施第二次追肥时才又浇水，这一次浇水时间比当地农民约迟七天，以便小麦发展须根。
    韩城气候温暖，但是史安福的南涧南村在一条山沟中，春天多西北风，因此春寒较长，有“春寒冬不寒”的说法。当地土壤是黑色壤土，土层厚，土质疏松，透水通气都好。史安福的耕作方法和这两
    个自然条件也结合得很好。他种的碧玉麦怕冷，春寒是不利的条件。今年秋天，他就把种麦时间推后了几天。这样，可使来春小麦起身较迟，以免春寒冻害（太迟不好，会影响小麦分蘖）。一般农民怕麦根受冻都不敢早锄地；史安福创造了锄后耱一遍的办法便敢早锄，使以后一系列的作务都能按时进行。因为春寒涧水又凉，春天不能浇水，他便采用了浇“结冻水”的办法。因为土松透水快，后期小麦需水多时，他便采用了多浇的办法。为了避免多浇肥料流失，他便分两次施追肥。总之，适应当地的自然条件，史安福有许多创造。
        四、几点意见
    根据今年的经验，史安福如果进一步提高施肥、播种、选种等技术，并改用新式农具，他的小麦单位面积产量还会提高；比如增施速效氮肥，改种耐寒丰产麦种，注意田间选种等等。史安福今年所用肥料，氮肥不够，如果在孕穗期增施一些肥田粉，不但能提高小麦产量，还能改进小麦的品质。他今年种的碧玉麦怕冷，而且根据过去的经验，碧玉麦的丰产潜在能力还不够大，又不能抗吸浆虫害，因此，史安福还可以试种碧蚂四号小麦或其他能抗吸浆虫的麦种。
    史安福今年才和其他三户农民组成了一个互助组。今后，他们在组织起来的基础上，进一步改进技术和使用新式农具，是进一步提高单位面积产量的方向。今年史安福还是用锨翻地，用手播种。如果他用新式步犁和改良耧，增产的情况还会好得多。（新华社）（附图片）
