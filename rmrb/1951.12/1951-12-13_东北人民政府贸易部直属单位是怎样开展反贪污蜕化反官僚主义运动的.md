    I. Overview of the Movement

    Based on Comrade Gao Gang's report on anti-corruption, anti-degradation, and anti-bureaucracy, the CCP Committee of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government conducted a detailed analysis and study of the situation within its system. It also held detailed discussions at Party meetings on why this movement was being launched today, especially the significance of launching this movement in the trade sector. Everyone clearly recognized that if this movement was not carried out, the work could not be done well, and the socialist state-owned trade forces could not be strengthened.

    On September 5th, the Trade Department convened a mobilization meeting for all staff, exposing previously collected materials. Many of these involved the leading cadres themselves. At the same time, the leadership expressed its firm attitude towards launching this movement and appropriately criticized incorrect thinking. At the time, the masses reacted like this: "The higher-ups have already set the stage," "This time, it's probably going to happen," and so on. There was a mixture of doubt and belief, but more belief than doubt. Everyone expressed support for this measure.

    Based on the above situation, a joint Party-Government meeting was held that evening to discuss the specific methods and steps for carrying out this movement. Everyone believed that to make this movement take off, two things must be emphasized: first, the responsible comrades of all units, large and small, must combine the specific circumstances of their unit and use the spirit of self-criticism to make another mobilization report to the masses, expressing a firm attitude; second, core forces must be organized to study the situation in a timely manner, lead the movement, and criticize incorrect thinking at any time.

    Then came the study of documents. At this time, many incorrect ideas were exposed in various units, such as "The leadership has bureaucracy, I cannot but be corrupt." Or "I never touch money, how can I be corrupt?" A particularly common erroneous idea was: "High salaries can foster integrity; the current salaries are still low, how can I not be corrupt?" While exposing erroneous ideas, the masses were also mobilized for preliminary criticism.

    After this, some people began to expose corrupt acts. However, many people still had concerns: mainly that when the section chiefs and administrators were present, the staff and cooks, etc., did not dare to speak. Later, it was discovered that this was because although the upper and middle-level leading cadres had all made self-criticisms and expressed their attitudes, the lower-level leading cadres had not yet made self-criticisms or expressed their attitudes, so the masses still had many concerns. For example, someone said: "I am far away from the minister and manager, and I am under the nose of the section chief and division chief every day. If I speak against them, what if they retaliate?" Therefore, the call to "raise awareness and break down concerns" was put forward, and a meeting of activists was convened, calling on lower-level responsible comrades to take the lead in self-criticism. It was pointed out that they were all key figures, and only when they expressed their attitudes could the movement unfold. As a result of this, more and more people among the masses exposed corrupt behavior and confessed to wrongdoings day by day. Soon, a second mobilization meeting of all staff was convened, calling on everyone to "stand firm, safeguard the interests of the people's state, and boldly expose all the vile phenomena of benefiting oneself at the expense of the public." And once again criticized certain erroneous ideas among the masses. This mobilization meeting had a great effect. From then on, the masses in most units took action and launched a movement to confess and report corrupt behavior.

    In order to enable the movement to develop in depth, special attention was also paid to propaganda and mobilization work. Each unit published blackboard newspapers, and the ministry published a "Quick Report." In addition, cadre who had already confessed were organized into rotational training classes to give typical reports in various units, which also had a great effect.

    II. Several Issues in the Movement

    First, to truly launch this movement, the thinking of leading cadres must be firm. And to make the thinking of leading cadres firm, they must have a correct understanding of the significance of the movement. Regarding this issue, the responsible comrades of the ministry, bureaus, divisions, and companies had repeatedly discussed it. Everyone realized that to strengthen the state-owned trade forces, the cadres must first be healthy. Otherwise, if some people spend private merchants' money, eat private merchants' food, embezzle state property, steal state things, and are unable to see problems everywhere in their work (because they only think about their own problems), or see but do not handle them, or handle them ineffectively; then, improving the level of policy thinking and business ability will all become empty talk. The corrupt behavior of the staff of the Fushun City Coal Construction Company had reached such a point: "Public discussion, dividing the money in restaurants." How can we talk about doing the job well? Experience has proved that units where leading cadres realize this and have a very firm attitude, the movement develops quickly and well; otherwise, it is not fast or good.

    Some leading cadres thought that "there probably aren't any problems in this unit," so they did not take a firm enough attitude towards the movement. However, in fact, those units not only had problems, but also had many and significant problems. For example, Manager Zhang of the Northeast Regional Native Produce Company once said to the section chiefs:

    "We just have a little bureaucracy, nothing else." However, after the movement was launched, a single clerk accepted a bribe of 100 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below) at one time, causing the state to lose 3 billion yuan. This fully shows that the idea of "probably there aren't any problems" is wrong.

    The firmness of leading cadres must also be manifested in conducting self-criticism seriously and taking the lead in making confessions. Otherwise, saying "we are determined" to the masses a million times will be useless. For example, the leading cadres of the Northeast Regional Cotton Yarn Company did not do this, and the masses said: "You have a lot of problems, don't make confessions, and still talk about us!" The leading cadres of the Northeast Regional Petroleum Company took the correct measures from the beginning, and the masses quickly followed suit. Experience has proved that not only the leading cadres of bureaus and companies must do this, but also the responsible cadres of sections, divisions, and offices.

    Second, fully mobilizing the masses, raising awareness, and dispelling the concerns of some people is the fundamental method for carrying out the movement. Because this movement is a struggle between new and old ideas. The entire process of the movement's development is the process of the struggle between new and old ideas. Throughout the entire movement, attention must be paid to studying the ideological situation of the masses at any time, discovering various concerns and incorrect understandings, and organizing the masses to criticize them. For example, some people said: "This is a great wind; whoever it blows, that person is unlucky." Some people asked him: "If this great wind blows away your dirty disease, what's unlucky about that?" Someone said: "I will lose face if I make a confession." The masses asked him: "If you have done bad things, is it glorious not to make a confession?" In response to the concerns of some people about retaliation, everyone was organized to discuss: "Why are we afraid of retaliation but not afraid of harming the interests of the state?" As a result of the discussion, everyone unanimously believed that this was individualism at work. After these discussions, everyone's awareness was raised, and the movement was launched.

    Many comrades with low awareness are very afraid of retaliation. In addition, many leading cadres lack a democratic style. It is not enough to just criticize them for being wrong or to just say don't be afraid. The leadership must also support those who report. That is, those who dare to criticize and expose should be commended in a timely manner, and those who dare to threaten others or retaliate against others should be given strict criticism or punishment in a timely manner. A young comrade from the Northeast Regional Petroleum Company wanted to give his opinion to the leaders. He had written the letter, but he did not dare to hand it in. After the minister's mobilization, he finally handed it in and was immediately praised. At the same time, the leadership ordered the cadres concerned to make a self-criticism based on this letter. As a result, the movement in the Northeast Regional Petroleum Company was launched.

    Third, because this movement is an extremely complex and meticulous work, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership. The main problems to be solved here are: 1. Because daily work is very busy, time must be arranged appropriately. The method adopted by the leadership of the Trade Department was: to make a plan for the movement in advance and strive to adhere to its implementation. The slogan put forward among the masses was: "Finish the work quickly and squeeze out time to do the movement well." As a result of this, work efficiency was improved, and the movement was also launched. Facts have proved that the idea that "the movement cannot be carried out when work is busy" is wrong. 2. There are many agency units of the Trade Department in Shenyang, and it is not enough to rely on a few administrative responsible comrades to lead the movement. Therefore, the Party Committee transferred 17 comrades to specifically help the leading comrades conduct inspection and supervision. Like the ministry, each bureau and company also transferred two or three people to do this. 3. There must be layer-by-layer leadership, layer-by-layer responsibility, and organization of core forces. That is to say, each layer must be grasped tightly, inspected at each layer, and supervised at each layer; otherwise, the upper level will move and the lower level will not, or the lower level will move and the upper level will not. However, the so-called layer-by-layer responsibility does not mean only following one line; when necessary, it is also possible to meet with the masses above the level.

    Fourth, after the movement has deepened, in addition to continuing to dispel the concerns of the masses, raise awareness, and mobilize everyone to analyze and discuss the issues raised, to achieve clarity between right and wrong, strengthen the leadership of the Party, and seek consensus among leading cadres, because the awareness of the masses has been raised (of course, the awareness of leading cadres will also be raised), they will inevitably concentrate their fire against bureaucracy. Because it is the hotbed for cultivating the germs of corruption and degradation. At this time, leading cadres must continue to conduct appropriate self-criticism in order to make the movement more effective. And unite the masses in principle. The administrative side of the Trade Department and the CCP Committee estimated that there would be some difficulties in doing so and took a series of measures to promote leading cadres at all levels to continue to make self-criticisms. They explained to them that the responsibility of leading cadres is to successfully lead the movement, which requires in-depth self-criticism. Because this is an important method for improving oneself, improving the masses, and uniting the masses. To this end, the Party and administrative aspects of the Trade Department have continuously commended those who have made progress in their self-criticisms and helped those who have ideological concerns. Because the vast majority of leading comrades have made further self-criticisms, they have changed their style of work and united and improved the masses. A few cadres who could not withstand criticism have also gradually changed.

    III. The Gains of the Movement

    The gains of this anti-corruption, anti-degradation, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Trade Department are very great. In addition to enhancing the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government among the masses, strengthening the relationship between leaders at all levels and the masses, and educating everyone to understand the importance of criticism and self-criticism, the main thing is that it has greatly improved the awareness of all staff and universally established the concept of cherishing state property. A spirit of thrift has been formed in the agency. According to the statistics of the headquarters of the Trade Department alone, 2,408 catties of gasoline were saved in October. The expenditure on electricity bills has been reduced by more than one-half compared with before the movement. At the same time, the sense of responsibility and work enthusiasm of cadres have also increased significantly. For example, the work tasks of the Northeast Regional Petroleum Company in the fourth quarter are much larger than in previous quarters, but due to the improvement in work efficiency, the tasks in October have been completed as planned. Some units have also established many necessary work systems in order to plug the loopholes in corruption and waste.

    东北人民政府贸易部直属单位是怎样开展反贪污蜕化反官僚主义运动的
    本报综合稿
    一、运动的概况
    根据高岗同志关于反贪污蜕化反官僚主义的报告，东北人民政府贸易部中共党委对本系统的情况，作了详细的分析研究，并在党的会议上，详细地讨论了为什么在今天开展这一运动，特别是在贸易部门开展这一运动的意义。大家明确地认识到如果不开展这个运动，工作就无法做好，无法壮大社会主义性质的国营贸易力量。
    九月五日贸易部召开全体工作人员动员大会，把事先搜集的材料揭露出来。其中有很多都是领导干部本身的事情。同时在会上表明了领导方面对发动这一运动的坚决态度，并对不正确的思想作了适当的批判。当时群众这样反应：“上面已经把架子拉开了”，“这回大概是要搞了”，等等。疑信参半，但是疑的少，信的多。大家都表示拥护这一措施。
    根据以上情况，当晚又召开了党政联席会议，讨论开展这一运动的具体方法和步骤。大家认为要使这一运动开展起来，必须强调两条：一是一切大小单位的负责同志，一定要结合本单位的具体情况，用自我批评的精神，再向群众作一次动员报告，表示坚决的态度；一是要组织核心力量，及时地研究情况，领导运动，随时批判不正确的思想。
    接着学习文件。这时，各单位暴露出来许多不正确的思想，如“领导上有官僚主义，我不能不贪污”。或是“我从来不摸钱，那里能够贪污”。特别普遍的错误思想是：“厚俸才能养廉，现在薪俸还低，我怎能不贪污？”和暴露错误思想同时，又发动群众进行了初步的批判。
    这以后，有些人就开始揭发贪污事实了。但是很多人还有顾虑：主要是科长、管理员在场时，科员和炊事员等就不敢说话。后来发现这是因为上面和中间的领导干部虽然都作了检讨，表示了态度；但是下层的领导干部还没有作检讨，没有表示态度，以致群众还有不少顾虑。例如，有人说：“我离部长、经理远，天天在科长、股长的眼皮底下，我要说了他们，他们要报复怎么办？”于是又提出“提高思想、打破顾虑”的号召，并召集了活动分子会议，号召下层负责同志带头检讨。指出他们都是关键人物，只有他们表示了态度，运动才能展开。这样作的结果，群众中揭发贪污行为和坦白错误事实的人便一天天地多起来了。不久，又召开了第二次全体工作人员动员大会，号召大家“站稳立场，维护人民国家的利益，大胆揭发一切损公利己的恶劣现象”。并再次批判了某些群众中的错误思想。这次动员大会收到了很大的效果。从这以后，大多数单位的群众都行动起来，展开了坦白和检举贪污行为的运动。
    为了使运动能深入开展，还特别注意了宣传鼓动工作。各单位都出了黑板报，部里出了“快报”。此外还组织轮训班已经坦白的干部到各单位作典型报告，这也收到很大效果。
    二、运动中的几个问题
    第一、要把这一运动真正开展起来，领导干部的思想必须坚定。而要领导干部的思想坚定，则必须使他们对运动的意义有正确的认识。关于这一问题，部、局、处、公司的负责同志曾反复地讨论过。大家认识到要壮大国营贸易的力量，就必须首先使干部健康起来。不然，若干人花私商的钱，吃私商的饭，捞国家的财产，偷国家的东西，工作中到处是问题也看不见（因为他们只想自己的问题），或看见也不办，或办而不力；那末，提高政策思想水平和业务能力就都成了空谈。像抚顺市煤建公司的工作人员的贪污行为，竟然到了这种地步：“公开议论，饭馆分钱。”这怎么能够谈得到把工作做好呢？经验证明：凡是领导干部认识到这一点、态度非常坚决的单位，运动就开展得快，开展得好；反之就不快，不好。
    有些领导干部以为“本单位大概没有什么问题”，因此对运动所采取的态度就不够坚定。但是，事实上那些单位不仅有问题，而且有不少、不小的问题。如东北区土产公司的张经理曾向科长们说：
    “我们就有点官僚主义，别的没有什么。”可是运动开展以后，光一个办事员一次就受贿一亿元（东北币、下同），而使国家损失了三十亿元。这充分说明“大概没有什么问题”的想法是错误的。
    领导干部的坚决，还须表现在严肃认真地进行自我批评和带头检讨上。不然，向群众说一万遍“有决心”，也没有什么用处。如东北区花纱布公司的领导干部没有这样作，群众就说：“你们的问题一大堆，不检讨，还说我们呢！”东北区石油公司的领导干部一开始就采取了正确措施，群众就很快地跟着行动起来。经验证明：不但局、公司的领导干部要这样作，而且科、股、室的负责干部也要这样作才行。
    第二、充分发动群众，提高思想，打破某些人的顾虑，是开展运动的根本方法。因为这次运动是新旧思想的斗争。整个运动发展的过程，就是新旧思想斗争的过程。在整个运动中，必须随时注意研究群众的思想情况，发现各种顾虑和不正确的认识，组织群众进行批判。如有人说：“这是一阵大风，吹着谁，谁倒霉。”有的人就反问他：“这阵大风吹去你的脏病，有什么倒霉？”有人说：“我检讨了丢人。”群众就问他：“你作了坏事，难道不检讨就光荣吗？”针对某些人怕报复的顾虑，就组织大家讨论：“为什么我们怕报复而不怕损害国家利益？”讨论的结果，一致认为这是个人主义思想在作祟。经过这些讨论，大家的觉悟提高了，运动开展了。
    有许多觉悟不高的同志很怕报复，再加上不少领导干部缺乏民主作风，如果光批评他们不对，或者光说不要怕是不行的。领导方面还必须给检举的人撑腰。这就是：对敢于批评和揭发的人，及时加以表扬，对那些敢于威胁别人或对别人施行报复的人，及时地给以严格的批评或处分。东北区石油公司的一个青年同志，要对领导人提意见，信写好了，却不敢交上去，经过部长动员以后，他终于交了出来，并立即受到表扬；同时，领导方面又命令有关干部根据这封信作了检讨。这一来，东北区石油公司的运动开展起来了。
    第三、由于这个运动是极端复杂、细致的工作，因此必须加强组织领导。这里主要应解决三个问题：一、因为日常工作很忙，必须适当安排时间。贸易部领导方面采取的办法是：事先作好运动的计划，力争坚持执行。在群众中提出的口号是：“赶紧把工作作完，挤出时间好好搞运动。”这样作的结果，工作效率提高了，运动也开展起来了。事实证明：那种认为“工作忙就无法搞运动”的思想是错误的。二、贸易部在沈阳的机关单位很多，只靠几个行政负责同志来领导运动是不行的。因此，党委会抽调了十七个同志，专门帮助领导同志进行检查、监督。和部里一样，各局、公司也各抽了两三个人这样作。三、要层层领导，层层负责，并组织核心力量。也就是说要层层抓紧，层层检查，层层督促；否则就会上动下不动，或下动上不动。不过所谓层层负责，并不是只走一条线；必要的时候，越级和群众见面也是可以的。
    第四、在运动走向深入以后，除应继续解除群众的顾虑、提高思想，发动大家分析、讨论提出来的问题，达到明辨是非，加强党的领导，求得领导干部意见的一致以外，由于群众的觉悟程度提高了（当然领导干部的觉悟也会同样提高），必然会集中火力反对官僚主义。因为它是培养贪污、蜕化毒菌的温床。这时，领导干部必须继续进行恰当的自我批评，才能使运动收到更大的效果。并从原则上团结群众。贸易部的行政方面和中共党委会估计到这样作法会有一些困难，曾采取一系列的措施，推动各级领导干部继续进行检讨。向他们说明，领导干部的责任是成功地领导运动，这就必须深入进行自我批评。因为这是提高自己，也是提高群众、团结群众的重要方法。为此，贸易部的党和行政方面曾不断表扬那些检讨有进步的，帮助那些思想上有顾虑的。由于绝大部分领导同志都作了进一步的自我批评，因而转变了作风，团结和提高了群众。少数经不起批评的干部，也逐步有了转变。
    三、运动的收获
    贸易部这次反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义运动的收获是很大的。除提高了共产党和人民政府在群众中的威信，密切了各级领导和群众之间的关系，教育大家懂得了批评和自我批评的重要性外，主要是大大地提高了全体工作人员的觉悟程度，普遍树立了爱护国家财产的观念。机关里的节约风气已经形成。仅据贸易部本部统计，十月份节省汽油达二千四百零八斤。电灯费开支比运动开展前减少了二分之一以上。同时干部的责任心和工作积极性也显著提高。如东北区石油公司第四季度的工作任务比以前各季大得多，但由于工作效率提高，十月份的任务已按计划完成。有些单位为了堵塞贪污浪费的漏洞，还建立了许多必要的工作制度。
