    How the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Escaped the Threat of Major Fatal Accidents in Production
    Qi?
    Under the education of the Party, the workers of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine have raised their political consciousness and production enthusiasm, created a new record of safe production, escaped the threat of major fatal accidents in production, and production has shown a thriving scene.
    The Jiaozuo Coal Mine was liberated at the end of 1948. In the year after liberation, although the workers' lives have improved somewhat, due to unsound leadership, the feudal foreman system still existed, and cadres were paralyzed in their thinking, casualties still occurred frequently. In 1949, the total number of casualties was 893 (28 deaths, 129 serious injuries, and 736 minor injuries). This situation aroused great attention from the Party organization in October 1949. According to the central government's policy on safe production, the CPC Jiaozuo Coal Mine Committee specifically analyzed the reasons for the serious casualties in the Jiaozuo mining area. The main reasons were: unqualified engineering, poor safety equipment, cadres being satisfied with the status quo, and neglecting safety work. They believed: "A piece of meat sandwiched between four stones, the coal mine is like a battlefield, and even the best commander cannot escape death!" "If you are always by the Yellow River, how can you not stumble?" Most workers have the superstitious idea of "three points of disaster when going down the well", believing that "to produce coal, you cannot ensure safety, and to ensure safety, you cannot produce coal." "With the spirit of the Old Lord in heaven, let's resign ourselves to fate!" Some workers, when they walked to the well and heard that the whistle sounded bad, turned back and said, "The whistle sound is unlucky, we can't go down the well today." Seeing these situations, the leading cadres clearly pointed out that safe production is the greatest welfare and greatest requirement of the working class, unified the thinking of all cadres, and mobilized everyone to work together to carry out safety work in all aspects. The administrative side opened a safety training class; selected a large number of activists, and educated these activists on engineering specifications and technology; reformed the production system and management system. The trade union organized veteran workers and technicians to discuss the painful lessons of the past 50 years; in the training class, 128 accidents were analyzed, so that workers specifically realized that the occurrence of each accident was the responsibility of people, and there were no ghosts or gods at work; as long as attention was paid to safety, accidents due to negligence could be avoided. The hundreds of activists who had been trained became promoters and organizers of safe production in the mining area. A safety publicity campaign was launched throughout the mine. In this way, the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers was raised, and the scientific thinking of the workers was enhanced; then a mass inspection was carried out, a safety plan was formulated, and engineering equipment was improved. In the five appraisals of labor models, 156 labor models and Liu Jiuxue's safe production model group, which had no casualties for 17 months, emerged. The Party committee and the trade union summarized the experience of Liu Jiuxue's safe production model group and promoted it throughout the mining area.
    In July last year, the Jiaozuo mining area held a mining-wide award ceremony for Liu Jiuxue's safe production model group, and Liu Jiuxue's group was supported and loved by the broad masses. Many workers were determined to strive to be a model. However, some people still thought that the leadership was making a fuss about nothing. Some people said: "How can Liu Jiuxue be regarded as more important than an engineer?" Some people unconvincedly said: "Ask him to go down three times a day to help us, and see what he can do!" They also said: "Look at the people in Liu Jiuxue's group, some are old, some are young, and there is even a blind man, who is also a model!" Individual bad elements took destructive actions. Saying: "A person died in Liu Jiuxue's group in February 1949, if we learn from him, will one person also die!" (Actually, a person died before liberation, and it was not Liu Jiuxue's responsibility). Leading cadres used facts to break these wrong views and resistance. Immediately afterwards, a meeting of cadres above the level of group leader was held with 857 people. Combining their own work, they learned from Liu Jiuxue's experience, and mobilized reputable activists to publicize to everyone. Many groups challenged Liu Jiuxue with safe production as the main condition. After such in-depth and extensive publicity and education, many people made self-criticisms and further cleared ideological obstacles. In order to make every Party member consciously and actively participate in and lead this movement, a Party member training class was opened, and all Party members in the mining area were trained once. These Party members played a decisive role in the extensive and in-depth development of Liu Jiuxue's safe production movement. For example, after being trained, Party member Xu Laoguai turned his class into a Liu Jiuxue-style model class, such as Xu Jichun, Xu Zhenyin, Guo Yun, Jin Erhu, etc., who could all work in dangerous areas by setting an example and help others solve difficulties, which won the support and trust of the masses and expanded the Party's influence among the masses. At the same time, the leadership also promptly corrected the complacency of Liu Jiuxue's group after being awarded. In this way, the "Liu Jiuxue Safe Production Movement" was universally carried out in all mines in the Jiaozuo mining area.
    After the "Liu Jiuxue Safe Production Movement" was launched, the Jiaozuo mine appeared with situations that had never existed in history: in 1950, the overall mortality rate decreased by more than 93% compared with the mortality rate in 1949, there was only one serious injury, and minor injuries decreased by more than 84.6%. The Lifeng mine eliminated deaths throughout the year. In the first, second, and third quarters of 1951, the entire mining area eliminated serious injuries, and there were only 118 minor injuries. Compared with the same period in 1950, casualties decreased by a total of 62.79%. The "Liu Jiuxue Safe Production Movement" in the past 16 months has resulted in ten Liu Jiuxue-style model classes and ninety-nine Liu Jiuxue-style model groups in the entire mining area. Many classes and groups compare production, safety, and learning with Liu Jiuxue's class. For example, Xu Jicheng's class in Wangfeng has not had a single minor injury since the launch of the "Liu Jiuxue Safe Production Movement"; in 1950, it exceeded the production task by more than 1,600 trucks, and in 1951, it won the safe production model bonus again. Due to the mutual competition between various model classes and workers in the entire mining area, the entire mining area began to move towards safe production. In terms of production efficiency, in 1950, it exceeded the task by more than 16%, and in the first, second, and third quarters of this year, it exceeded the last increase production plan by 10.77%; compared with the first, second, and third quarters of last year, it exceeded 35.01%. The increase production plan stipulates that the average efficiency of the entire mine should reach 0.785 tons per person per day, but it has actually reached 0.8076 tons, exceeding the increase production plan by 2.77%; compared with the same period last year, it exceeds 23.62%. The material consumption quota has also been greatly reduced, saving the country wealth worth 6 million jin of millet from January to June.
    Due to the good safety production, the thinking of the mine workers has undergone fundamental changes. In the past, underground production was unsafe, and when husbands and sons went down the well to mine coal, their families prayed to gods at home for protection. During the Spring Festival in 1950, workers and their families went to the Laojun Temple to offer 500 pigs. At that time, the promotion of breaking superstitions was also carried out, but it did not have much effect on the workers. The safety production facts of the past year educated all the workers and their families. During the Spring Festival in 1951, not even a single pig was offered. The families no longer pinned their hopes on the lives of the workers on the Old Lord, but on scientific safety knowledge. In the past, because the mine was unsafe, girls were unwilling to marry coal miners; now that safety has been improved, and the workers have improved their political status and cultural and technical level, girls in rural areas believe that it is an honor to marry workers. This change in social thinking has further promoted the broad masses of workers to work hard to carry out safe production and political, cultural, and technical learning, and prepared conditions for further improving production.

    焦作煤矿怎样摆脱了生产中重大伤亡事故的威胁？
    齐?
    焦作煤矿职工，在党的教育下，提高了政治觉悟和生产热情，创造了安全生产新纪录，摆脱了生产中重大伤亡事故的威胁，生产上出现了欣欣向荣的景象。
    焦作煤矿在一九四八年底解放。解放后的一年中，工人虽然生活上得到了一些改善；但是由于领导不健全、封建把头制依然存在、干部思想麻痹，伤亡事故仍然时常发生。一九四九年，全年伤亡八百九十三人（死二十八人，重伤一百二十九人，轻伤微伤七百三十六人）。这个情况在一九四九年十月引起了党组织的极大重视。中共焦作煤矿党委根据中央关于安全生产的方针，具体分析了焦作矿区发生严重伤亡事故的原因。这些原因主要的是：工程不合规格，保安设备差，干部满足现状，忽视保安工作。他们认为：“四块石头夹块肉，煤窑好似战场，再好的指挥官也不能不死人！”“常在黄河边，那能不失脚？”大部分工人有“下井三分灾”的迷信思想，认为：“要出煤就不能保安，要保安就不能出煤。”“有老君爷在天之灵，听天由命吧！”有的工人走到井边听见汽笛声不好，便转回来说：“汽笛声不吉利，今天不能下井。”看到这些情况，领导干部就明确指出安全生产是工人阶级的最大福利和最大要求，统一全体干部的思想，发动大家一齐动手，从各方面进行安全工作。行政方面开办了保安训练班；选拔了大批的积极分子，对这些积极分子进行了工程规格和技术的教育；改革了生产制度和管理制度。工会组织老年工人和技术人员座谈五十年来的惨痛教训；在训练班的学习中，分析了一百二十八件事故，使工人具体地认识到每一个事故的发生都是人的责任，并不是有什么鬼神作祟；只要注意保安，责任事故就能避免。训练过的几百个积极分子，在矿区里成为安全生产的宣传者和组织者。全矿掀起保安的宣传运动。这样，提高了广大职工的阶级觉悟，增进了工人的科学思想；然后又进行了群众性的大检查，制订了保安计划，改善了工程设备。在五次评判劳动模范中，涌现出来一百五十六名劳动模范和十七个月没有伤亡事故的刘九学安全生产模范组。党委和工会总结了刘九学安全生产模范组的经验，向全矿区推广。
    去年七月间，焦作矿区召开了全矿区的刘九学安全生产模范小组受奖大会，刘九学组受到广大群众的拥护与爱戴。有许多工人下决心要争取模范。但有的人还认为是领导方面有点小题大做。有人说：“怎么把刘九学看得比工程师还重要？”有的人不服气地说：“叫他每天下去转三圈帮助帮助咱，看他有啥本事！”还说：“看刘九学组的人老的老、小的小，还有一个瞎眼睛的，也当了模范！”个别坏分子却采取了破坏的行为。说：“刘九学组在一九四九年二月死过一个人，我们向他学习，也死一个人吗！”（实际上是解放前死过一个人，也不是刘九学的责任）。领导干部用事实打破了这些错误观点和抗拒。紧接着召开了八百五十七人的小组长以上干部会。结合自己的工作，学习刘九学的经验，发动有威信的积极分子向大家作宣传工作。不少小组以安全生产为主要条件向刘九学应战。经过这样深入广泛的宣传教育后，很多人都做了自我检讨，进一步扫除了思想障碍。为了使每个党员自觉地积极地参加和领导这一运动，开办了党员轮训班，把矿区所有的党员训练了一遍。这些党员对刘九学安全生产运动广泛深入的开展起了决定的作用。如党员许老怪受训后，把自己的班变成刘九学式的模范班，如许继纯、许真银、郭运、靳二虎等，都能以身作则地在易出危险的地区工作，并帮助别人解决困难，得到了群众的拥护和信任，扩大了党在群众中的影响。同时，领导方面也及时纠正了刘九学组受奖后的自满情绪。这样，“刘九学安全生产运动”就在焦作矿区各矿普遍地开展起来。
  “刘九学安全生产运动”开展以后，焦作矿出现了历史上从来没有的情况：一九五○年全年死亡率比一九四九年死亡率减少了百分之九十三强，重伤只有一人，轻微伤减少百分之八十四点六强。李封矿全年消灭了死亡。一九五一年一、二、三三季全矿区消灭了重伤，轻伤只一百十八人。和一九五○年同期相比，伤亡共减少百分之六十二点七九。十六个月来的“刘九学安全生产运动”，使全矿区出现了十个刘九学式的模范班，九十九个刘九学式的模范组。许多的班、组和刘九学班比生产、比安全、比学习。如王封许继成班自开展“刘九学安全生产运动”以来，没发生一个轻伤微伤；一九五○年超过生产任务一千六百多车，一九五一年又获得安全生产模范奖金。由于各个模范班和全矿区职工互相竞赛，全矿区开始走向安全生产。在生产效率方面，一九五○年超过任务百分之十六强，今年一、二、三三季超过最后一次增产计划的百分之十点七七；和去年一、二、三三季相比，超过百分之三十五点零一。增产计划规定全矿平均效率要达到每人每天零点七八五吨，实际上已达到了零点八○七六吨，超过增产计划百分之二点七七；和去年同期相比，超过百分之二十三点六二。材料消耗定额也大大降低，从一月到六月，给国家节约了价值六百万斤小米的财富。
    由于搞好了安全生产，矿区职工的思想起了根本的变化。过去井下生产不安全，丈夫儿子下井挖煤，家属在家求神保佑。一九五○年春节，工人和他们的家属先后到老君庙祭奠的上供猪就有五百口。那时也宣传破除迷信，但对工人作用是不大的。一年来的安全生产事实，教育了全体职工和家属，一九五一年春节连一口上祭的猪也没有了。家属对工人的生命不再是寄托在老君爷身上，而是寄托在科学的保安知识上。过去因为矿山不安全，姑娘们都不愿和煤矿工人们结婚；现在安全搞好了，而且工人们提高了政治地位和文化技术水平，所以农村中的姑娘们都认为和工人结婚是光荣的。这种社会思想的变化，更促使了广大职工努力进行安全生产和政治文化技术学习，为进一步提高生产准备了条件。
