The Central Trade Department Holds Mobilization Meeting
    Determined to Vigorously Oppose Corruption and Waste
    Calling on All Personnel to Fight Against Serious Corruption Phenomena

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Central People's Government Ministry of Trade held a mobilization meeting against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy on the 17th of this month. More than 5,000 staff members from various departments, offices, professional companies, and their affiliated units in Beijing attended the meeting. First, Minister of Trade Ye Jizhuang delivered a mobilization report. He said: Today, we are launching a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, which has great political and economic significance. He pointed out that corruption and waste in the state-owned trade system are very serious. Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are the enemies of increasing production and practicing economy, so we must vigorously oppose them. He called for: (1) Leading cadres at all levels should first examine their own work, thoughts, and actions, and then conduct mutual inspections within their units from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and there should also be mutual inspections between departments; (2) Broadly mobilize the masses, promote democracy, and encourage the masses to report violations; (3) Corrupt elements should be given different treatments according to the severity of their crimes and the degree of their confession. Those who confess should be given lenient punishment.

    Next, Vice Minister Yao Yilin gave a report, saying: Today's meeting is an offensive meeting. We must mobilize all our forces to launch a general offensive against all phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. He cited examples to illustrate the serious corruption in the trade system. For example, Li Yuchao, deputy manager of the Zhejiang Provincial Oil Company, and others embezzled 1 billion yuan collectively; Ma Jiesan, deputy director of a factory under the China Fur Company, colluded with private merchants to sell commercial information, accepted bribes from private merchants, and embezzled more than 200 million yuan, causing the company to lose 1 billion yuan; Wang Zhenguo of the China Bristles Company sold commercial information and accepted bribes from private merchants, embezzling more than 70 million yuan; Shi Bohan and Jiang Koushi of the Education Department of the Personnel Department embezzled more than 100 million yuan by purchasing houses for the Advanced Commercial Cadre School; and there are many other corruption cases. Secondly, he pointed out two kinds of waste: one is the waste caused by insufficient work experience, insufficient sense of responsibility, and the idea of supply system in the work. Such as roundabout transportation, transportation towards each other, unsound engineering design, and poor packaging. These phenomena are different in nature from corruption, and the solution is to overcome the idea of supply system and strengthen economic accounting. The other is wasting state property to satisfy personal enjoyment, such as spending public funds at will, giving gifts, entertaining guests, and watching dramas. This kind of waste is similar to corruption. In his report, Vice Minister Yao emphasized that corruption is shameful, and waste is equally shameful. He said: Corruption and waste in the People's Government are the manifestation of the bourgeoisie's corrupting ideas invading the staff of the People's Government. Many of the staff in the trade system come from former merchants, former employees, and former intellectuals, and many of them have not been thoroughly reformed. The bourgeois ideology invaded our enterprises and government through these people. At the same time, due to the nature of their work, the staff in the trade system are often in contact with domestic and foreign capitalists, and even some weak-willed veteran cadres and Communist Party members cannot stand the test and become corrupt. Therefore, the trade department should be regarded as a key point in the inspection of the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement.

    After the mobilization report, the director of the General Office of the Central Trade Department, the heads of various departments and offices, and the managers of various companies all firmly expressed their determination to support the call of Minister Ye Jizhuang and Vice Minister Yao Yilin with practical actions and launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    中央贸易部举行动员大会
    决大张旗鼓反对贪污浪费
    号召全体人员向严重的腐化现象作斗争
    【本报讯】中央人民政府贸易部在本月十七日举行反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的动员大会，到会的有各司、处，各专业公司及其在北京的所属各单位全体职工五千余人。大会首先由叶季壮部长作动员报告。他说：今天我们来开展一个反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，是具有伟大的政治和经济意义的。他指出：国营贸易系统的贪污浪费现象很严重。贪污、浪费、官僚主义，是增产节约的敌人，所以我们要大张旗鼓地反对。他号召：（一）各级负责干部首先应检查自己的工作、思想、行为，然后在本单位内自上而下、自下而上相互检查，各部门之间也要互相检查；（二）广泛发动群众，发扬民主，鼓励群众检举；（三）对贪污分子，应按他们罪恶大小、坦白程度给以不同的处理。坦白者要从轻处分。
    接着，姚依林副部长作报告，他说：今天这个会，是个进攻大会。要发动我们所有的力量，向一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象作总的进攻。他举例说明贸易系统中存在严重的贪污现象。如浙江省油脂公司副经理李郁超等集体贪污十亿元；中国皮毛公司所属某厂副厂长马捷三勾结私商出卖商情，接受私商贿赂，贪污二亿余元，使公司损失十亿元；中国猪鬃公司王振国出卖商情，接受私商贿赂，共贪污七千余万元；人事司教育处石伯韩、姜叩石购买高等商业干部学校房子，贪污一亿余元；其他贪污案件还有许多。其次，他指出两种浪费现象：一种是由于工作经验不足，工作责任心不够和供给制思想，造成工作中的浪费。如迂回运输，相向运输，工程设计不周密，包装不好等。这些现象与贪污性质不同，解决的方法是克服供给制思想，加强经济核算。另一种是浪费国家资财，满足个人生活享受，如随便开销公款，送礼，请客，看戏等，这种浪费是与贪污相近似的。姚副部长在报告中，着重地指出：贪污可耻，浪费也同样可耻。他说：人民政府中的贪污浪费现象，是资产阶级腐化思想对人民政府工作人员侵袭的表现。贸易系统的工作人员中有不少出身于旧商人、旧职员、旧知识分子，其中有不少尚未经过彻底改造。资产阶级的思想，就经过这些人侵袭了我们的企业和政府。同时由于工作关系，贸易系统的工作人员经常与国内外资本家接触，甚至一些意志薄弱的老干部、共产党员，也经不起考验，就贪污蜕化下去。所以在检查贪污浪费运动中，应把贸易部门作为一个重点。
    动员报告后，中央贸易部办公厅主任，各司处负责人，各公司经理等，都坚决表示以实际行动来拥护叶季壮部长、姚依林副部长的号召，展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。
