Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: The ideological remolding study movement for teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities is gradually unfolding in depth.

Teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities have widely conducted ideological mobilization work in the first stage of their studies. After Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a report on the remolding of intellectuals on September 29th, the study committees and responsible persons of each school continued to mobilize within their respective schools. In this stage, teachers focused on clarifying the significance and purpose of ideological remolding, correcting some incorrect learning attitudes, and making preliminary discussions on the issue of standpoint and whom to serve.

Responsible persons of each school generally attached great importance to this study. Many school presidents took the lead in participating in the study and conducting self-criticism. The Tsinghua University School Affairs Committee determined that teacher study was the school's top priority this semester. To ensure teachers had enough time to study, departments could appropriately streamline courses if necessary, and the work and plans of teaching and research offices could also be appropriately modified. This solved the difficulty of teachers not being able to allocate their time. Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, Zhou Peiyuan, Provost of Tsinghua University, Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University, Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University, and Sun Xiaocun, President of Beijing Agricultural University, all actively led the study movement and took the lead in making self-criticisms. Their exemplary actions greatly promoted the study of teachers in various schools.

Teachers have initially unfolded criticism and self-criticism in discussions. Many teachers who prided themselves on their knowledge and superb skills have already felt the need to study and transform their thinking. Many teachers at Tsinghua University prepared speaking outlines before attending group meetings. Li Qinghai, chairman of the Civil Engineering Department of the school, carefully sorted out and analyzed his historical and ideological problems before attending the group meeting, and took the lead in conducting self-criticism at the meeting, which greatly enlightened everyone. Due to the preliminary unfolding of criticism and self-criticism in the study, the previously serious phenomenon of disunity among teachers has changed. After conducting ideological examination in connection with their actual work, many teachers have begun to improve teaching content and teaching methods. Teachers from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University have also reached a consensus on the issue of the adjustment of departments in the three universities.

In order to guide the study to closely connect with reality, teachers from various schools have selected prominent figures in their schools for analysis, and then combined this with their own thoughts to conduct criticism. For example, Peking University discussed and analyzed the thought of Hu Shi, Yenching University discussed the issue of John Leighton Stuart, Nankai University discussed and analyzed the thought of Zhang Boling, and Tsinghua University teachers discussed and analyzed the thought of Mei Yiqi, the former president of the school. In the discussion of these specific figures, teachers from various schools generally combined this with their own thoughts to conduct self-examination, so that the study gradually deepened.

In the process of discussion and criticism, all schools paid attention to highly promoting democracy, encouraging free debate, in-depth analysis, and preventing the phenomenon of drawing conclusions simply and rashly. Many schools also paid attention to absorbing the opinions of students. For example, Beijing Agricultural University mobilized students to offer opinions to teachers, and their opinions greatly helped teachers' reflection and self-examination.

The first stage of the Beijing and Tianjin university teachers' study movement (ideological mobilization, correcting learning attitudes) has roughly concluded and has now entered the second stage, which focuses on studying documents, criticizing feudalism and imperialism and other reactionary ideas, and drawing a clear line between the enemy and ourselves; the third stage of this study movement focuses on establishing the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism and criticizing various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies; the fourth stage is to discuss the reform of higher education in accordance with the needs of national defense construction and economic construction; the fifth stage will be a summary.

    京津高等学校教师思想改造学习运动逐步深入
    各校教师学习第一阶段大致结束
    此次学习运动全部过程共分为五个阶段
    【新华社四日讯】北京、天津高等学校教师思想改造学习运动，正逐步深入展开。
    北京、天津高等学校教师在第一阶段的学习中，广泛地进行了思想动员工作。从九月二十九日周恩来总理作了关于知识分子改造问题的报告以后，各校分学习委员会和各校负责人分别在校内继续进行了动员。各校教师在这一阶段中，着重在弄清思想改造的意义和目的，纠正一些不正确的学习态度，并对立场问题和为谁服务的问题，作了初步的讨论。
    各校负责人一般都很重视这次学习，许多学校的校长带头参加学习，进行自我思想检讨。清华大学校务委员会确定：教师学习是这学期全校的首要任务，为了保证教师学习时间，必要时各系可以适当精简课程，教研室的工作和计划也可适当修改。这样就解决了教师们时间分配不过来的困难。北京大学校长马寅初、清华大学教务长周培源、燕京大学校长陆志韦、辅仁大学校长陈垣、北京农业大学校长孙晓村等都积极领导学习运动并带头作自我检讨。他们这种示范行动对各校教师学习起了很大的推动作用。
    教师们在讨论中初步展开了批评和自我批评。许多以自己的学识和技术高超自恃的教师们，已经感到需要学习，改造思想。清华大学许多教师在开小组会以前都作了发言提纲。该校土木系系主任李庆海在开小组会以前认真整理、分析自己的历史和思想问题，在会上带头进行自我检讨，对大家启发很大。由于学习中初步地展开了批评和自我批评，教师之间过去严重的不团结的现象已经有了改变。不少教师结合实际工作进行思想检查后，已着手改进教学内容和教学方法。北京大学、清华大学和燕京大学的教师们对三校院系调整问题也取得了一致的认识。
    为了引导学习密切联系实际，各校教师都选择了本校中突出的人物，进行分析，接着就联系自己的思想，进行批判。如北京大学讨论和分析了胡适的思想，燕京大学讨论了司徒雷登的问题，南开大学讨论和分析了张伯苓的思想，清华大学教师讨论和分析了该校前校长梅贻琦的思想。各校教师在对这些具体人物的讨论中，一般都联系着自己的思想进行检讨，使学习逐步深入。
    在讨论和批判的过程中，各校都注意了高度发扬民主，鼓励自由争辩，深入分析，防止简单轻率地下结论的现象。不少学校还注意吸收学生们的意见，如北京农业大学发动学生对教师提意见，他们的意见对教师的反省和检讨帮助很大。
    北京、天津高等学校教师学习运动的第一阶段（思想动员、端正学习态度）已大致结束，现在进入第二阶段，即着重研究文件，批判封建主义和帝国主义等反动思想，划清敌我界限；这次学习运动的第三阶段学习重点是建立马克思列宁主义的基本观点，批判各种资产阶级和小资产阶级思想；第四阶段是按照国防建设和经济建设的需要，讨论高等教育改革问题；第五阶段进行总结。
