    Anti-Bureaucratic Public Document Exhibition
    Attracts Attention from All Sides
    Temporarily Suspended for One Week to Prepare for Expanded and Enriched Content
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] Since the opening of the Anti-Bureaucratic Public Document Exhibition held by the central political and legal departments, staff members from various agencies and organizations have enthusiastically visited, reaching over 8,000 people to date. Tianjin municipal agencies have also sent representatives to visit. Some departments, after visiting, are preparing to organize study sessions and conduct inspections in connection with their own work. The Beijing Municipal People's Government and some central-level departments are also preparing to submit materials to participate in the exhibition. This anti-bureaucratic public document exhibition has attracted attention from all sides.
    The general feedback from viewers is that this exhibition is very enlightening and educational for staff members of agencies and organizations. The content is specific and profound, causing people to be "greatly surprised" by the drawbacks of bureaucracy, and to have a further understanding of the essence of bureaucracy. At the same time, it is also helpful for simplifying official documents and improving work. Cadres from the central political and legal departments said: "After seeing the exhibition, we have a new understanding of official documents, and we must follow the 'Public Document Simplification Agreement' in our work." Cadres from other departments said after seeing it: "Bureaucracy is prevalent in all agencies, and we must conduct inspections and study sessions in connection with our own unit's work after returning." A viewer from a local agency, while looking at the "Official Document Travel" diagram in the exhibition, said: "It doesn't matter if official documents travel like this in the central agencies, but the lower levels are dying waiting!"
    The viewers recognized the political significance of this exhibition, and therefore put forward many positive suggestions. Among the more common and important ones are: hoping to widely organize visits, expand publicity, and launch a large-scale anti-bureaucracy movement; vigorously implement it through the leading agencies at the central level, and improve the work of government agencies comprehensively. In addition, some people hope to further enrich the materials and expand the scope of the exhibition.
    The exhibition office accepted the opinions of the viewers, and in order to further expand and enrich the exhibition content and absorb materials from other units, it was decided that the exhibition will be suspended for one week starting from the 10th. At the same time, it was also decided to increase the exhibition time and implement a method of scheduled visits. After the exhibition content is enriched, it will further expand its effect and influence.

    反文牍主义公文展览会
    引起各方面的重视
    暂停一周准备充实内容扩大展览
    【本报讯】中央政法部门反文牍主义公文展览会自展出以来，各机关、团体工作人员前往参观的十分踊跃，截至目前为止，已达八千余人。天津市属机关也曾派人来参观。有些部门在参观后，准备组织学习，联系本单位的工作进行检查。北京市人民政府及中央级一些部门并且准备选送材料，参加展览。这个反文牍主义公文展览会已引起各方面的重视。
    观众的一般反映是：这个展览会对机关、团体工作人员有很大的启发和教育意义。内容具体、深刻，使人对于文牍主义的弊害感到“大吃一惊”，并且对文牍主义的本质有了进一步的认识。同时对于简化公文、改进工作也有不少帮助。中央政法部门的干部说：“看过展览会，对公文有了新的认识，回去一定要遵照‘简化公文公约’办事。”其他部门的干部看过以后说：“文牍主义普遍存在于各个机关，回去后要联系本单位工作进行检查与学习。”一位从地方机关来的观众，在展览会中的
    “公文旅行”图旁，边看边说：“公文在中央机关中这样旅行不要紧，下边可等得要死啦！”
    观众们认识了这一展览会的政治意义，因而提出很多积极的建议。其中比较普遍和重要的是：希望广泛组织参观，扩大宣传，开展一个大规模的反文牍主义运动；通过中央一级的领导机关，大力贯彻，从全面来改进政府机关工作。另外也有一些人希望进一步充实材料，扩大展览的范围。
    展览会办公室接受观众的意见，为了更加扩大和充实展览内容，吸收其他单位的材料，决定从十日起，展览会暂停一周。同时还决定了增加展览时间、实行参观预定日程的办法。展览会充实内容之后，将会进一步扩大效果和影响。
