Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 19th: Panchen Erdeni and all members of his entourage departed from Xining City, Qinghai Province, on December 19th to return to Tibet. Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government specially appointed Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, as their representative to see him off in person. People from all walks of life in Xining City also lined the streets to bid him farewell. The Qinghai Provincial People's Government, in addition to issuing orders to local people's governments along the way to prepare food and provide diligent hospitality, also dispatched armed forces to escort him.

After the signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Panchen Erdeni and the Dalai Lama exchanged telegrams. The Dalai Lama sent several telegrams welcoming Panchen Erdeni to return to Tibet as soon as possible. The Tibetan local government also appointed two officials, a Khenchung (official in charge of the Dalai Lama's palace affairs) and a Depon (fourth-rank official), as well as the chief representatives of the three major monasteries of Drepung, Sera, and Ganden, to go ahead and welcome him.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 19th: More than 1,000 representatives from all ethnic groups and circles in Qinghai Province held a grand meeting on the 16th to bid farewell to Panchen Erdeni as he left Qinghai to return to Tibet.

Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, delivered a farewell speech on behalf of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Northwest Military and Political Committee, congratulating the close unity of the Tibetan people and all fraternal nationalities in the country. Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), member of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, Zhang Zhongliang, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Shoushan, Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, Liao Hansheng, Vice Chairman and Political Commissar of the Qinghai Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and Xirao Jiatsuo (Tibetan), Vice Chairman, all spoke at the farewell meeting. They unanimously congratulated the unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni. In his speech, Xirao Jiatsuo expressed the hope that the personnel of the Panchen's entourage would always remember the kindness bestowed upon the Tibetan people by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. He said: Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, it would be impossible for Panchen Erdeni and the personnel of the Khenpo Council to return to Tibet. Only under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao can the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni eliminate old grudges and make Tibet more united internally. He hoped that after Panchen Erdeni and the personnel of the Khenpo Council return to Tibet, they will study hard, wholeheartedly serve the people, and earnestly and thoroughly implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government. In his speech of thanks, Panchen Erdeni expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and the Party, government, and army of Qinghai Province for their care since liberation and their warm farewell this time. He also expressed that after returning to Tibet, he would unite closely with the Dalai Lama under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government to thoroughly implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. At the meeting, representatives and children from all ethnic groups and circles in Xining presented flowers and banners to Panchen Erdeni. The meeting also passed a congratulatory telegram to the Dalai Lama.

Before departing, Panchen Erdeni and the personnel of his Khenpo Council held a soiree and banquet to present Hada scarves, banners, Tibetan incense, Pulu woolen fabric, and other gifts to Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and the responsible persons of the Qinghai Provincial Party, government, and army to express their gratitude.
