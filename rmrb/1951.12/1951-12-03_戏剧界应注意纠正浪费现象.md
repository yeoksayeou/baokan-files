    The Theater World Should Pay Attention to Correcting Wasteful Practices

    Today, as the people of the whole country are warmly responding to Chairman Mao's call and launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, the theater world should also examine and eliminate various wasteful phenomena. According to reports in Shanghai's Wenhui Daily, the wasteful practices currently existing in the Shanghai theater world are quite serious. Many theater troupes compete to perform grand dramas, boasting about luxurious sets and gorgeous costumes, regardless of the needs of the plot. Many so-called historical costume dramas are actually bizarre costume dramas. A famous actor often changes several sets of clothes in one performance. The cost of costumes for individual actors in a single play can reach over 20 million yuan. Some theater troupes stipulate that actors provide their own costumes, and often after a play is performed, the costumes are discarded or altered, unable to be used by a second actor. Other aspects such as lighting, equipment, and staffing also suffer from serious waste due to being divorced from actual needs, which needs to be thoroughly changed. In the movement to increase production and make donations, the theater world has shown excellent results. It is hoped that the theater world will achieve even better results in the movement to increase production and practice economy. Theater units should include "Practicing Economy" as an important item in the "Patriotic Pact," make concrete plans for saving, and oppose the vulgar bourgeois style of simply playing tricks with costumes and sets, divorced from the plot, and using spending a lot of money to attract audiences.

    戏剧界应注意纠正浪费现象
    在全国人民热烈响应毛主席的号召，展开增产节约运动的今天，戏剧界也应该检查并消除各种浪费现象。据上海文汇报反映，目前上海戏剧界所存在的浪费现象是相当严重的。许多剧团竞演大戏，不顾剧情需要，以布景豪华、服装华丽相夸耀。许多所谓古装戏，实际上是奇装戏，一位名角往往唱一场戏换几套衣服。演出一出戏，个别演员的服装费用竟有达两千万元以上的。有些剧团规定服装由演员自备，常常一出戏演毕，服装便被废弃或改制，不能给第二个演员穿用。其他如灯光、装置、人员编制等方面，也由于脱离了实际需要存在着严重浪费现象，需要彻底改变。在增产捐献运动中，戏剧界曾表现了很好的成绩，希望在增产节约运动中戏剧界有更好的成绩出现。戏剧界各单位应将“厉行节约”作为“爱国公约”中的一个重要项目，做出具体的节约计划，反对那种离开剧情、单纯在服装布景上翻花样，以花钱多来号召观众的资产阶级的庸俗作风。
