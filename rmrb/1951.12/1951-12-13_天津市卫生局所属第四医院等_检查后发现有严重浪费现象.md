    Tianjin Health Bureau's Fourth Hospital and Others
    Found to Have Serious Waste After Inspection
    
    Editor: Recently, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Health Bureau inspected the Fourth Hospital and Second Health Clinic affiliated with the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau, and found that the Fourth Hospital and Second Health Clinic had waste and losses in terms of business expense expenditures and in the storage and use of medicines and materials.

    The Fourth Hospital lost 33 X-ray films in one year, equivalent to approximately 4.4 million RMB. In March of this year alone, the loss calculated from ten types of medicines listed on prescriptions reached 1.8 million RMB. In addition, penicillin losses totaled 3.18 million RMB. The Fourth Hospital uses hundreds of kinds of medicines. If we extrapolate based on this situation, the amount of loss is quite alarming. Due to lax storage, the nursing department broke 28 thermometers in half a year. Purchasing items also did not inquire about market prices. For example, the price of medicine bottles purchased from private merchants was 35 percent higher than the general market price.

    The Second Health Clinic already had a hand-cranked sedimentator that was sufficient, but spent 3.3 million RMB to buy an electric sedimentator. The collection of "delivery" fees also did not comply with the system established by the Health Bureau, and there were instances of arrears for a year without payment. In addition, there were phenomena such as using gauze as curtains and tablecloths, or borrowing public property for long periods of time without returning it. After the inspection, the hospitals under the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Health Bureau have established management systems and are preparing to completely eliminate this phenomenon in the future.

    We suggest that finance, health, and other departments in various regions launch an inspection campaign to expose and eliminate this unnecessary loss and waste.

    天津市卫生局所属第四医院等
    检查后发现有严重浪费现象
    编辑同志：最近天津市人民政府财政局、天津市人民监察委员会和天津市人民政府卫生局检查了天津市卫生局所属的第四医院和第二卫生所，发现第四医院和第二卫生所在业务费支出上、在药品材料的保管和使用上，都有浪费和损失现象。
    第四医院一年来损失爱克司光胶片三十三片，合人民币约四百四十万元。今年三月份一个月，按处方笺所列十种药品计算，损失就达一百八十万元。另外盘尼西林也损失合人民币三百一十八万元。第四医院用药不下数百种，如按这种情况类推，损失的数目是相当惊人的。由于保管不严，护理部半年内打坏了体温计二十八个。采购物品也不探听市价，如向私商购买的药瓶价格比一般市价要高百分之三十五。
    第二卫生所原有的手摇沉淀器已经够用，而又用三百三十万元买了电机沉淀器一架，收取“接生”费用也不遵守卫生局所订制度，竟有拖欠一年不交的现象。此外，还有用纱布作窗帘，作桌布，或借公物长期不还等现象。在检查后，天津市人民政府卫生局所属各医院已定出管理制度，准备今后彻底消灭这种现象。
    我们建议各地财政、卫生等部门都能开展一个检查运动，揭发并消灭这种不应有的损失和浪费现象。    罗会文
