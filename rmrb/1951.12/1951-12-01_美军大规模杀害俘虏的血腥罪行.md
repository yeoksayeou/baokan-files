The inhuman atrocities of Nazi Germany in the Buchenwald, Dachau, and Auschwitz concentration camps, and the exterminationist crimes of the Japanese invaders in massacring prisoners of war on the Chinese mainland and the Bataan Peninsula, once enraged the world. But today, the appalling crimes committed by the American invading army in Korea, systematically and massively slaughtering captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People’s Armies, far surpass the atrocities of Buchenwald and the Bataan Peninsula. This kind of atrocity by the bloodthirsty American beasts is an unprecedented act of barbarism in human history.

The U.S. generals, beasts in human clothing, have more than once boasted of their "humanitarianism" in treating prisoners of war, guaranteeing that they would treat prisoners according to the "humanitarian principles" of "civilized nations." Even Hanley, the shameless fellow who recently fabricated the "massacre of prisoners" by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, grandly said, "The United Nations forces have never killed a single Communist prisoner of war." However, the bloody facts of the tens of thousands of captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies who have already been brutally murdered by the "United Nations forces" tell the people of the world: American imperialists are the world's biggest liars and most ferocious butchers. Their talk of "not mistreating prisoners" is only to cover up their heinous crimes of barbarously and cruelly abusing and killing prisoners.

Let us look at the bloody facts of the U.S. military's abuse and killing of prisoners! A statement issued by the spokesman of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army in February 1951 pointed out: At 4:00 p.m. on December 1, 1950, when units of the U.S. 2nd Division fled from Jungseo-ri, Gachun County, South Pyongan Province, they collectively massacred 31 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and 35 innocent Korean people with machine guns. All of those killed had paper tags reading "Prisoner of War" hung on their chests.

Even the reactionary American magazines had to admit this kind of massacre of prisoners of war. The "Time" magazine published on August 21, 1950, carried a long report by Osborne, a reporter for "Life" and "Time" magazines stationed in Korea, entitled "An Ugly War!" Osborne began by saying, "This is a report that Americans do not want to write. This is an ugly story in an ugly war." "I have to say this is a particularly terrible war, because in order to win, we force our soldiers to adopt the most savage actions and styles on the battlefield." What kind of savage actions and styles are these? Osborne did not dare to say it, but he said, "The South Korean army fighting alongside us is also the same barbaric and inhuman. I personally saw South Korean police killing prisoners alive for fear of danger while escorting them to the rear." In this way, people can see what Osborne was referring to when he spoke of the U.S. military's barbaric actions.

According to the accusations of Korean People's Army soldiers Kim Cheon-il, Kim Jun-geun, Hong Gi-man, Choi Sang-eun, etc., who escaped from the U.S. military's "prisoner of war camps," the atrocities of massacring and abusing prisoners of war were being carried out in a planned and large-scale manner in the U.S. military's "prisoner of war camps." The U.S. military's general "prisoner of war camps" were surrounded by four or five layers of electric fences. Inside the "prisoner of war camps," the prisoners suffered all kinds of American-style tortures: their eyes were blinded by electric light; their fingernails were peeled off; whips lashed at the bodies of prisoners whose skin had already cracked; the prisoners' bodies were burned with red-hot iron bars; gasoline was poured into the prisoners' mouths and set on fire; people were placed in large wooden cabinets and steamed with steam, then dragged out and fed to police dogs. Live burial, mass shootings, rape of female prisoners, and all kinds of medieval tortures that are difficult to describe in words were carried out in the concentration camps. Many American military doctors and "scientific" personnel entered the prisoner camps pretending to treat the prisoners, but in fact secretly put deadly chemical agents and germs on living people for experiments. The fact that torture and slaughter were used to force captured Chinese and Korean personnel to reveal military secrets was even more common. For example, the U.S. military's "Suwon Prisoner of War Camp" had a lightless "special prison" filled with rotting corpses, a "special torture chamber" specifically for carrying out various kinds of severe torture, a "special jail" filled with mosquitoes that specialized in sucking human blood, and a "steam jail" specifically for steaming prisoners to death with steam. For example, on a certain island in Gyeongsangnam-do, there was a "prisoner of war camp" that was called "Death Island" or "Living Hell" by local residents. This "prisoner of war camp" had a gallows, on which there were often the corpses of those who had been hanged, and the military police tied the corpses to telephone poles for shooting practice. For example, at the so-called "Daejeon Prisoner of War Camp," about three kilometers from Daejeon City, various atrocities were carried out every day, and female prisoners were subjected to all kinds of insults: rape, cutting off breasts, chopping off hands and feet, pulling out fingernails, and pouring gasoline on their bodies and setting them on fire. According to Korean People's Army soldier Hong Gi-man, who escaped from this "prisoner of war camp," half of the prisoners in the prisoner camp were killed in just one week. Korean People's Army soldier Kim Cheon-il, who escaped from the so-called "United Nations Busan Prisoner of War Camp," said: Outside the camp, "from far away, one could hear the miserable screams of those being tortured and the bursts of whip sounds. Nine out of ten who went in were dragged out dead. In one day, I saw the executioners drag out more than forty People's Army comrades who had been beaten to death from a torture chamber." Under such large-scale, planned abuse and killing by American beasts, according to the extremely incomplete statistics cited by Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-young in his telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the United Nations Security Council on November 19, 1951, nearly 17,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were cruelly murdered or starved to death this year in many U.S. military "prisoner of war camps" in South Korea.

The U.S. military's crimes of abusing and killing prisoners are not only in the hands of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies with undeniable and conclusive evidence, but also admitted by the captured U.S. military officers and soldiers. According to Otto Bell of HS Company, 2nd Combat Battalion, 2nd Division of the U.S. Army, "Our (referring to the U.S. military) soldiers were ordered not to take in live prisoners sporadically, but to kill them." Bell said: "On November 31, 1950, between Sooncheon and Kunuri, I saw two hundred Chinese and Korean prisoners brutally killed by the South Korean army. ... Chinese and Korean prisoners were locked in cages with barbed wire and placed outdoors. At that time, it was a very cold winter." According to Edison Philip, a former infantryman (military number R.A. 11179178) in the 1st Company, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, in his written report: "Once an officer ordered me to go outside the city to deliver a letter. As I was walking out of the city, I heard a terrible commotion. I ran over to take a look and saw that several military policemen were busy burying North Korean prisoners alive. ... They threw the North Korean prisoners into the pit and then filled it with soil. I saw the hands and legs of the North Korean prisoners sticking out of the soil, and the military policemen cut off their hands and legs with long knives. ... The next morning, I saw two military policemen executing North Korean prisoners. ... Once again, we captured six North Korean prisoners ... Before long, we heard gunshots, and we ran over to take a look and saw that the six North Koreans who had just been captured had been shot."

The atrocities of the Li bandit army under the command of the U.S. military in killing prisoners were also shocking. Therefore, even British Labour Party Member of Parliament Pannell, in a speech on the Korean issue on November 5, 1950, demanded the immediate arrest of Syngman Rhee and his punishment as a war criminal. He also said: "The cruelty of Syngman Rhee's henchmen, the mass murder of civilians and prisoners of war by Syngman Rhee's police (about which there is much news) are all carried out under the banner of the United Nations." Is there any doubt that the atrocities of the Li bandit army under the "United Nations forces" were carried out under the command of the U.S. military?

In contrast to our army's lenient treatment of prisoners of war and providing them with various cultural, recreational, medical, and health care, the U.S. military also forced captured Chinese and Korean personnel to do various kinds of hard labor. A dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Tokyo on February 19, 1951, reported: "The government of the Republic of Korea is now planning to transport a large number of Communist prisoners of war to Geoje Island, just south of Masan Port, to use the prisoners to develop the island." (What a touching term!) Regarding the spread of diseases in the U.S. "prisoner of war camps," a dispatch from Reuters in Tokyo on September 3 acknowledged: "An Allied health expert said here today that dysentery is prevalent among Communist prisoners of war imprisoned on Geoje Island in South Korea. He said: In early July, the hospital in the concentration camp admitted seventy-five to ninety dysentery patients every day." A dispatch from the Associated Press in Geoje Island, Korea, on May 18 also reported: "There are several thousand Koreans in that prisoner of war camp. Among them, 1,400 are very seriously ill. Among the rest, about 80 percent are infected with some kind of disease." However, as everyone knows, even with extremely limited medical equipment, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies are doing their best to treat prisoners of war.

Another inhumane means by which the American invading army killed captured personnel of our army was to use prisoners for experiments with various large-scale killing weapons. In March of this year, a U.S. military bacterial landing craft No. 1091, sailing under the name of "epidemic prevention," sailed to Wonsan Port on the east coast of Korea and used captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for experiments with bacteriological weapons. On April 9, the American "Newsweek" published a message entitled "The Black Death Ship," revealing this bloody incident. The message said: "Note the secret mission of a Navy's experimental epidemic prevention ship. This ship has been sent to Wonsan Port on the east coast of North Korea. There, the Navy has maintained a long-term siege." The article continued: "This ship is an infantry landing ship, equipped with laboratories, rats, and rabbits." It also said: "The Marines caught some Chinese Communists from the small island in the port and brought them to the ship to test whether they had symptoms of the terrible Black Death." Brigadier General Sams, Director of the "Public Health Bureau" of the U.S. military command in Korea, received the "Cross of Honor" for this. Soon, the bacterial landing craft sailed to Geoje Island, forty miles southwest of Busan. According to the Associated Press, there were "half a dozen corrals" on Geoje Island, imprisoning captured personnel of the Korean People's Army. The purpose of the ship's trip to Geoje Island was to use captured personnel of the Korean People's Army as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. The Associated Press said: The ship's "laboratory, extending from the prisoner of war camp on Geoje Island, obtained cultures of oral and intestinal bacteria, and conducted three thousand tests every day." The ship's "laboratory, twenty feet square, was packed full, and all thirty-eight people were working at full capacity." The Associated Press also admitted: These heinous bacterial war criminals "are not unaware of the anger they are causing," but they shamelessly admitted that the work they are doing now is "more important than notoriety." Bacteriological weapons are strictly prohibited by civilized mankind, but the American invaders not only openly manufactured them, but even conducted inhumane experiments on prisoners of war. The American generals must not escape their due responsibility for this extremely heinous crime.

In August of this year, the American invaders committed another inhumane crime, that is: The American invaders used a 14,000-ton British ship to transport 1,000 prisoners of war from Korea, Vietnam, and other countries to the West for atomic explosion experiments. According to a report published by an Egyptian journalist who witnessed the incident in the Cairo weekly "Gomhur Misr" published on September 24, 1951: "Now I am sitting in the room of an Egyptian worker who works for an American cheese company, and even now, I tremble all over when I think of the terrible scene I saw."

One night, the Egyptian journalist discovered that five hundred Korean prisoners of war were loaded onto this ship in a port in South Korea. He wrote that it was an armed merchant ship. To better maintain secrecy, the ship's radio receiver was removed. Two hundred sailors guarded the ship, and there were only enough lifeboats on board for the crew. He continued, the people loaded on the ship were divided into groups. Each group would be used to test the different effects of atomic explosions. One group of people would not know what fate they would encounter—this group of people would be directly used for explosion experiments. Another group of people would know for sure at a fixed time what fate they would encounter; now, they were told that they were being transported to other prisoner of war camps. This bloodthirsty and malicious crime of the American invaders once again proves that the American invaders are beasts who have completely lost their humanity.

The facts listed above are only a small part of the thousands of crimes committed by the American invading army in Korea in abusing and killing captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean armies with various brutal methods. However, even these facts that have been revealed are enough to enrage peace-loving people all over the world. Such large-scale and inhuman crimes of abusing and killing prisoners of war are unprecedented. Civilized mankind must not tolerate this kind of beastly behavior. The Chinese and Korean people want to accuse the world: asking conscientious people to pay attention to this fact and jointly stop this heinous crime of the American invading army.

The American murderers and their instigators in Washington must be subject to severe and just sanctions by mankind!

    美军大规模杀害俘虏的血腥罪行
    胡思升
    在第二次世界大战中，人们曾经为纳粹德国在布痕瓦尔德集中营、达豪集中营以及奥斯威辛集中营中残杀战俘的令人发指的非人兽行所震怒；人们也曾经为日寇在中国大陆、在巴丹半岛残杀战俘的灭绝人性的暴行所震怒。但是在今天，美国侵略军在朝鲜犯下的有计划地大量残杀中朝人民部队被俘人员的令人发指的暴行，已绝不是布痕瓦尔德以及巴丹半岛上的暴行所能比拟的了。嗜血成性的美国野兽们的这种暴行，是人类历史上空前的野蛮行为。
    人面兽心的美国将军们，曾不止一次地吹嘘他们对待战俘的“人道主义”，保证他们按照“文明国家”的“人道原则”对待战俘。甚至就在最近捏造中朝人民军队“残杀俘虏”的那个无耻之徒汉莱也曾大模大样地说：“联合国军从未杀过一个共军战俘。”但是，成千成万被“联合国军”已经虐杀的中朝人民军被俘人员的血淋淋的事实，告诉全世界人民：美国帝国主义者是世界上最大的骗子和最凶恶的屠夫。他们侈谈“不虐待俘虏”只是为了掩盖他们野蛮地、残忍地虐杀俘虏的滔天罪行。
    让我们来看看美军虐杀俘虏的血淋淋事实吧！朝鲜人民军最高司令部发言人一九五一年二月发表的声明中曾经指出：一九五○年十二月一日午后四时，当美军第二师所属部队从平安南道价川群中西里逃窜时，竟将中国人民志愿军被俘人员三十一名与无辜的朝鲜人民三十五名以机枪集体惨杀。在那些被杀害的人们的胸前都挂有“战争俘虏”的纸片。
    这种惨杀战俘的行为连美国的反动杂志也不得不承认。一九五○年八月二十一日出版的“时代”杂志登载了一篇“生活”和“时代”杂志驻朝鲜记者奥斯本的长篇报道，题目是“丑恶的战争！”奥斯本劈头就说：“这是一篇美国人所不愿写的报告，这是丑恶战争中的丑恶故事”，“我得说这是一场特别恐怖的战争。因为我们要获取胜利，所以就强迫自己的兵士们在战场上采取最野蛮的行动和作风。”到底是什么样的最野蛮的行动与作风呢？奥斯本没有胆量说出口，但是他说：“和我们并肩作战的南朝鲜军队，也是同样的野蛮到惨无人道。我亲眼看见南朝鲜警察在押送俘虏回后方时，为了害怕危险而活活将俘虏杀死。”这样，人们就可看出奥斯本所说的美军的野蛮行动是指的什么了。
    据自美军“俘虏收容所”逃出的朝鲜人民军战士金泉一、金俊根、洪基万、崔尚恩等人的控诉，在美军的“俘虏收容所”里，屠杀和虐待俘虏的暴行是在有计划地、大规模地进行着。美军的一般“俘虏收容所”，四周都围上了四五层电网。在“俘虏收容所”里面，俘虏们都受尽了各种各样美国式的酷刑：眼睛被电光射瞎；指甲被剥去；皮鞭抽打在皮肉已裂开的俘虏们的身上；用烧红的铁条烫俘虏的身体；在俘虏口中灌满汽油，点火焚烧；把人放在大木柜里用蒸气蒸，蒸熟了再拖出来喂警犬。活埋、集体枪杀、强奸女俘虏以及种种用文字难以描述的中世纪的酷刑都在集中营内施行着。许多美国军医和“科学”人员走进俘虏营假装给俘虏们治病，实际上却是偷偷地把杀人的化学药剂与病菌放在活人身上做试验。为了逼迫中朝被俘人员谈出军事机密而施行酷刑拷问和屠杀的事实更是普遍的。例如美军的“水原俘虏收容所”，里面有堆积着腐烂尸体的毫无光线的“特别监狱”，有专门进行各种严刑拷打的“特刑室”，有满屋养着专吸人血的蚊子的“特别监”，有专门把俘虏用蒸气蒸死的“蒸气监”。又如在庆尚南道某一个岛上有一个“俘虏收容所”，该岛被当地居民称为“死亡岛”或“活地狱”。这个“俘虏收容所”设有绞刑台，在绞刑台上经常有被绞死者的尸体，宪兵们并把尸体绑在电线杆上作射击演习。又如离大田市约三公里的所谓“大田俘虏收容所”，在那里每天进行着各种暴行，对女俘虏进行各种凌辱：强奸、割掉乳房、剁掉手和脚、拔指甲以及在她们身上浇以汽油，点火燃烧。据从这个“俘虏收容所”逃出的朝鲜人民军战士洪基万说：仅仅在一个星期内，该俘虏营的俘虏就被杀死了一半。从所谓“联合国军釜山俘虏收容所”逃出来的朝鲜人民军战士金泉一说：在收容所外“老远就听见被拷打的人的凄惨叫声和阵阵的皮鞭声。进去的十个有九个是死了被拖出来。我在一天当中，看到刽子手从一个刑房里拖出了四十多个被打死的人民军同志。”在美国野兽这样大规模的、有计划的虐杀之下，据朝鲜外务相朴宪永于一九五一年十一月十九日致电联合国大会主席和联合国安全理事会主席的声明中所引的极不完全的统计：在南朝鲜的许多美军“俘虏收容所”中，今年有近一万七千名朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员被残酷地杀害或饿死了。
    美军虐杀俘虏的罪行，不仅在中朝人民部队手中握有无法抵赖的确凿的证据，而且被我俘虏的美军官兵也都供认了这种事实。据美军第二师第二战斗营HS连的奥托·贝尔说：“我们的（指美军）士兵奉命不要零星收容活的俘虏，而是要把他们杀死。”贝尔说：“一九五○年十一月三十一日，我在顺川和军隅里之间，看到有两百个中国和朝鲜俘虏被南朝鲜军队残酷地杀死。……中国和朝鲜俘虏都被关在有刺铁丝网的笼子里，放在户外，那时正是天气很冷的冬天。”又据前在美军第二十四师第十九步兵团第一连当步兵（军号R·A·11179178）的爱得生·菲力浦在他所写的书面报告中说：“有一次军官命令我到城外去送信。当我正走出城的时候，我听到一阵可怖的骚动声。我跑去一看，原来是几个宪兵正在忙着活埋北朝鲜俘虏。……他们把北朝鲜俘虏扔在坑里，然后再用土填上。我看到北朝鲜俘虏的手和腿从土里钻出来，宪兵们便用长刀把手和腿砍断。……第二天早上，我又看见两个宪兵在枪毙北朝鲜俘虏。……又一次，我们捉到了六个北朝鲜俘虏……不一会，我们便听到枪声，我们跑去一看，原来就是刚才被俘的六个北朝鲜人被枪毙了。”
    在美军指挥下的李匪军杀害俘虏的暴行也是骇人听闻的。因此甚至英国工党议员潘纳于一九五○年十一月五日在关于朝鲜问题的演说中，也要求立即逮捕李承晚并作为战犯惩办。他并说：“李承晚走狗们的残酷，李承晚警察大批谋杀平民和战俘（关于这些事有许多消息）都是在联合国旗帜下进行的”。难道还用怀疑，在“联合国军”属下的李匪军的暴行不正是在美军指挥下干的吗？
    与我军宽待俘虏、给俘虏以各种文化娱乐、医药卫生的照顾相反，美军还强迫中朝被俘人员做各种苦役。法新社东京一九五一年二月十九日电讯报道说：“大韩民国政府现正计划将大批共军俘虏运往马山港正南的巨济岛上，利用该批俘虏进行该岛开发工作。”（好动人的名词！）关于美方“俘虏收容所”中疾病蔓延的情形，路透社东京九月三日电讯承认：“盟国的一位卫生专家今日在此间称：囚禁在南朝鲜的巨济岛上的共产党战俘间流行着赤痢。他说：在七月初，集中营的医院每天收容七十五个至九十个赤痢病人。”美联社朝鲜巨济岛五月十八日电讯也曾报道：“那个战俘营里有好几千朝鲜人。其中一千四百人病得很厉害。其余的人当中，约有百分之八十染有某种疾病。”但是，大家知道，中朝人民军就是在极有限的医药设备下也是竭尽全力地医治战俘的。
    美国侵略军另一种惨无人道地杀害我军被俘人员的手段就是拿俘虏作各种大规模杀人武器的实验。今年三月间，美军的一艘以“防疫”为名的第一○九一号细菌登陆艇，开到朝鲜东海岸元山港，并以中国人民志愿军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验。四月九日美国“新闻周刊”以“黑死病船”为题，发表消息透露了这个血腥事件。该消息称：“请注意海军的一艘实验防疫的船只的秘密使命。这船已派至北朝鲜东海岸的元山港。在那里，海军已维持了一个长期的围攻。”该文继称：“这船是一艘步兵登陆船，上设实验室，老鼠兔子俱全。”并称：“海军陆战队从该港的小岛上抓了一些中国共产党，带到船上，试验他们是否已有可怖的黑死病的症候。”侵朝美军司令部“公共卫生局”局长赛姆斯准将，曾因此而获得了“十字勋章”。不久，该细菌登陆艇又开往釜山西南四十英里的巨济岛，据美联社透露：巨济岛上有“半打圈栏”，囚禁着朝鲜人民军的被俘人员，该船到巨济岛去的目的就是要以朝鲜人民军被俘人员作为细菌武器的试验品。美联社称：船上的“实验室自伸展在巨济岛上的战俘营，取得口与肠的病菌培养物，每天进行三千次试验”。该船“二十英尺见方的实验室挤得满满的，全体三十八个人都在全力地工作着。”美联社并承认：这些万恶的细菌战犯“并不是不知道他们所引起的愤怒”，但是，他们却无耻地承认，他们现在所做的工作，比“恶名更为重要”。细菌武器是文明人类所严禁使用的，而美国侵略者不但公然进行制造，甚至还拿战俘作着惨无人道的实验。对这一罪大恶极的罪行，美国的将军们绝不能逃脱他们应负的责任。
    今年八月间，美国侵略者更干下了另一桩灭绝人性的罪行，那就是：美国侵略者用一艘一万四千吨的英国轮船运送了一千名朝鲜、越南等国的俘虏，到西方去作原子爆炸的试验。据目睹其事的埃及记者在一九五一年九月二十四日出版的开罗周刊“久米尔、米斯里”上登载的报道中说：“现在我坐在一家在美国乳酪公司工作的埃及工人房里，甚至到现在，想到我所看见的可怖情景，我就全身发抖。”
    一天晚上，这位埃及记者发现，在南朝鲜的一个港口，五百名的朝鲜战俘装到了这只船内。他写道，这是一艘有武装的商船。为了更好地保密，船上的无线电收报机拿走了。两百名水手守卫着这只船，船上只有够船员使用的救生船。他继续说，装在船上的人们被分作几群。每一群将用来试验原子爆炸的不同效果。其中一群人将不知道会遭遇到什么命运——就是这一群人将直接用于爆炸试验。另一群人在一个固定的时候就可以知道他们一定会遭遇到的命运；现在，有人告诉他们，他们正被运往其他的战俘集中营。美国侵略者这种嗜血成性的恶毒罪行，再度证明了美国侵略者是完全灭绝了人性的野兽。
    以上所列举的事实，不过是美国侵略军在朝鲜以各种残暴方法虐杀中朝部队被俘人员千万件罪行中的一小部分，然而仅仅这些已经被揭露了的事实，已足使全世界爱好和平的人民为之震怒了。这样大规模地、惨无人道地虐杀俘虏的罪行是史无前例的。文明的人类绝不能容忍这种兽行。中朝人民要向全世界控诉：要求有良心的人类重视这种事实，并共同起来制止美国侵略军的这种滔天罪行。
    美国杀人犯及其在华盛顿的指使者，必须受到人类严厉的正义制裁！
