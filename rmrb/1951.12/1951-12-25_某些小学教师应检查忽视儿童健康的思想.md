    Some Elementary School Teachers Should Examine Their Ideas of Neglecting Children's Health
    To the Editor: On December 14th, the China Youth Daily published the news of the tragic death of Lin Kanglang, a twelve-year-old Young Pioneer, who was forced to blow a bugle by Ye Xilin, the principal of Xialin Elementary School in Dongyang Township, Wenling County, Zhejiang Province. We believe that Ye Xilin seriously violated the state's policy of protecting children, which is not allowed in a New Democratic society. Cultural and educational organs in various places should learn from this lesson and call on elementary school teachers to examine their ideas of disregarding children's lives and health in the ideological remoulding study movement.

    某些小学教师应检查忽视儿童健康的思想
    编辑同志：十二月十四日，中国青年报发表了浙江省温岭县东洋乡下林小学校长叶喜麟强迫十二岁的少年儿童队员林康郎吹号，因而酿成死亡惨剧的消息。我们认为，叶喜麟严重地违犯了国家保护儿童的政策，这是新民主主义社会不能允许的。各地文教机关应该接受这一教训，号召小学教师在思想改造学习运动中，检查漠视儿童生命和健康的思想。
