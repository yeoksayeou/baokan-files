Editor's Note: From some of the letters published here, it can be seen that some cadres, due to their corrupt lifestyles, are engaging in corruption and accepting bribes from unscrupulous merchants, causing huge losses to the country. Therefore, in addition to punishing cadres who are corrupt and accept bribes, it is also necessary to constantly pay attention to fighting against unscrupulous merchants and severely punish them for enticing cadres to do bad things. On the other hand, some units have caused losses to the country due to the bureaucracy of leading cadres, and those leading cadres should be punished. Today, the letters published here show that the punishment by the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry for Ren Zhonghao and Wu Congke, the factory director and deputy director of a certain military factory, for causing significant losses to the country due to bureaucracy, is correct.

Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications employee Zhang Fachang
    Corruption and Bribery Result in a Loss of 100 Million Yuan in State Property
    Zhang Fachang, an employee of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, has been given a demerit for corruption and bribery, resulting in a loss of 100 million yuan in state property. In March and April of this year, the Telecommunications Research Institute, under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, sent employee Zhang Fachang to Tianjin to purchase a batch of telecommunications equipment. During the execution of this task, Zhang Fachang accepted gifts such as watches, gold pens, and leather coats, worth more than 4 million yuan, as bribes from manufacturers. In addition, he often accepted "dinners" from manufacturers. As a result, the manufacturer, through Zhang Fachang's hand, sold telecommunications equipment worth about 200 million yuan for the high price of 300 million yuan to the Telecommunications Research Institute, causing a loss of 100 million yuan to state property. This incident was mainly due to Zhang Fachang's corruption and bribery, loss of his position, and being manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. However, the leadership of the Telecommunications Research Institute of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications did not carefully consider the use of cadres beforehand, and did not conduct detailed inspections during the course of the work, but simply "approved as is" based on Zhang Fachang's oral statement, which also shows negligence and a bureaucratic style. They must be held responsible for this loss. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications decided to give Zhang Fachang a demerit, hand over the items he received as bribes to the Research Institute to compensate for part of the loss, and order the leading cadres of the Research Institute to conduct a profound self-criticism.

Shandong Paper Mill employee Ding Mengxi, et al.
    Colluding with Private Merchants in Collective Embezzlement, Handed Over to the Court for Punishment
    Employees of the Central Ministry of Light Industry's Shandong Paper Mill and its affiliated business offices colluded with unscrupulous merchants in collective embezzlement, causing a loss of more than 50 million yuan in state property. Their embezzlement methods were varied. For example, purchasing agent Gao Bochao, et al., often secretly sent the procurement budget to unscrupulous merchants and discussed embezzlement methods with them. When bidding, they colluded with unscrupulous merchants to manipulate prices. When Zhao Jiagong, Sun Ying, et al., inspected and received goods, they accepted bribes from unscrupulous merchants and accepted inferior goods as good goods. When merchants who did not give bribes delivered goods, they used all means to create difficulties. In March of this year, the business office purchased 2,215 jin of pig iron through comparative pricing. Bochang Hardware Store won the bid with a quotation of 3,600 yuan per jin. When delivering the goods, the inspectors insisted that the goods were not good and refused to accept them. Later, Longchang Hardware Store, which was related to these inspectors, delivered the goods, and they transferred them to the main factory at a price of 5,250 yuan per jin. This time, state property was lost by more than 3.7 million yuan. Their collective embezzlement and bribery resulted in a loss of more than 50 million yuan to state property. The losses from their frequent inspection of materials "reporting inferior as superior" and weighing "reporting less as more" are not included.
    The above situation was reported by the masses, and after inspection by the Shandong Provincial People's Supervision Committee, it was found to be true. Ding Mengxi, et al., who had been engaged in long-term collective embezzlement and fraud, were suspended from their positions by the factory and handed over to the court for legal action in July of this year. The unscrupulous merchants who offered bribes have also been handed over to the judicial authorities for punishment according to law.

Liaoxi Suizhong County Magistrate Wang Zhe
    Extravagance and Waste, Misappropriation of Public Funds, Received Punishment
    Wang Zhe, the county magistrate of Suizhong County, Liaoxi Province, misappropriated public funds and property, indulged in extravagance and waste, and sought selfish enjoyment. In the autumn of 1950, the higher-level government decided to establish a wounded soldiers' hospital in Suizhong County. Instead of actively preparing for it, County Magistrate Wang Zhe took the opportunity to misappropriate more than 230 million yuan of the establishment funds for the wounded soldiers' hospital to satisfy his personal lifestyle, building 18 new-style houses and two small buildings for his unit. Furthermore, when Wang Zhe attended a rectification meeting in the province, he heard that the county's public cars were going to be handed over to the province. After returning to the county, he immediately replaced the two public cars with the county government's license plates. Later, fearing that a county government would have two cars and would have to transfer one, he privately sold one of the cars, obtaining more than 14 million yuan. He used this money to buy five sets of sofas, distributed two sets to the county party committee, one set to the public security bureau, and kept two sets for his own use. These things have shown that Wang Zhe disregarded the overall situation and only cared about his own unit, even misappropriating public funds and property, indulging in extravagance and waste, and seeking enjoyment. In order to educate Wang Zhe and avoid further losses to state property, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government People's Supervision Committee gave Wang Zhe two demerits in August of this year.

Chuandong Qidu County Gaozhen District Grain Depot Cadres
    Violating Regulations, Wasting State Resources
    Cadres of the Gaozhen District Grain Depot in Qidu County, Chuandong, violated regulations and wasted state resources. At the end of 1950, the grain depot cadres of this district, without authorization, misappropriated more than 80,000 jin of rice intended for warehouse construction in 1951 to build processing plants, dormitories, offices, bathrooms, and other non-urgent buildings, and purchased the latest and most exquisite office desks, wooden beds, file cabinets, and other non-urgent items. They also built a 150-foot-long wall in front of the building, which took four months and cost more than 90,000 jin of rice and more than 5 million yuan in RMB. In the course of these projects, they also demolished temple houses and cut down forests without authorization, and mobilized the masses to donate wood, bricks, and tiles. When using materials, they used large materials for small purposes and fine materials for rough purposes. The Chuandong People's Administrative Office People's Supervision Committee has inspected the illegal behavior of these grain depot cadres and is dealing with it.

Northeast Military Factory Leading Cadres
    Ideological Paralysis Causes Factory Fire
    Huge Losses to State Resources
    Yin Wenke, an employee of a military factory in Northeast China, neglected his duties, and the bureaucratic style of the factory's leading cadres caused huge losses to state property, and they have been punished accordingly. On February 6th of this year (the first day of the Lunar New Year), a military factory in Northeast China held a "Model Award Conference" in a theater in the city. Most of the factory's personnel went to participate, leaving a small number of employees to take charge of guarding the factory. The leading cadres did not make adequate arrangements, and the personnel left in the factory did not pay attention to the task of guarding the factory. For example, Yin Wenke, an employee left in the factory, slept in the duty room for the entire time he was on duty for six and a half hours, except for two trips to the toilet. When the factory building caught fire, he didn't know anything about it until the fire was large and was discovered by a patrolman (the cause of the fire is still under investigation). Moreover, because the factory's fire prevention preparations were very poor, everyone was in chaos when the fire alarm occurred and could not be rescued in time. As a result, all 810 square meters of the factory building were burned down, one-third of the motors and other machines were destroyed, and the other two-thirds were damaged. The total loss was 9,877,736,300 yuan in RMB. As for the loss due to the work stoppage caused by the fire, it is impossible to estimate. Yin Wenke should bear the main responsibility for the occurrence of this fire due to his negligence of duty, but the factory's leading cadres' insufficient attention to the factory's protection work, lax inspections, and ideological paralysis were also important reasons for the fire. The Department of Industry of the Northeast People's Government decided to remove Ren Zhonghao and Wu Congke, the factory director and deputy director of the factory, from their positions and give them a demerit, respectively, to remove Yin Wenke from his position and hand him over to the law, and to give other relevant personnel punishments respectively.

    反对贪污浪费，反对官僚主义！
    编者按：从这里发表的一些来信中看出，有些干部因为生活腐化，进行贪污，接受奸商贿赂，造成国家巨大损失。因此，除惩处贪污纳贿的干部以外，还必须经常注意和奸商作斗争，并给勾引干部作坏事的奸商以严厉惩处。另一方面，有些单位因为领导干部的官僚主义造成国家的损失，应对那些领导干部加以处分。今天这里发表的来信中，东北人民政府工业部对于因官僚主义造成国家重大损失的某军工厂正副厂长任中浩和吴从柯的处分是正确的。
    中央邮电部职员张发昌
    腐化受贿使国家财产损失
    一亿元
    中央人民政府邮电部职员张发昌腐化受贿，使国家财产损失一亿元，已受记大过处分。本年三、四月间，邮电部所属电讯科学研究所派职员张发昌到天津购买一批电讯器材。张发昌在执行任务中，接受厂商贿赂的手表、金笔、皮大衣等礼物，价值四百余万元。另外，他还经常接受厂商“请吃饭”。结果，厂商把实值二亿元左右的电讯器材，用三亿元的高价经张发昌手卖给电讯科学研究所，使国家财产遭受一亿元的损失。这件事情，主要是因为张发昌腐化受贿，丧失立场，被奸商捉弄所致。但邮电部电讯科学研究所领导方面，事前对使用干部不慎重考虑，工作进行中，又不详加检查，只凭张发昌口头一说，就“照单批准”，也说明了麻痹大意，有官僚主义作风，对这一损失，必须负责。邮电部决定给张发昌以记大过处分，把他所受贿赂的物品交研究所，以补偿部分损失，并令研究所领导干部作深刻检讨。政务院人民监察委员会通讯组
    山东造纸厂职员丁梦西等
    勾结私商集体贪污已交法院
    惩办
    中央轻工业部山东造纸总厂和所属营业所职员勾结奸商集体贪污，使国家财产损失五千多万元。他们的贪污方式是多种多样的。如采购员高伯超等，经常把采购预算偷送奸商，并和奸商共同商量贪污办法。遇投标时，和奸商勾结，操纵价格。赵家功、孙鍈等验货、收货时，接受奸商贿赂，把劣货当好货收进。不给贿赂的商号送货时，他们又用一切办法给以刁难。今年三月营业所比价购买元铁二、二一五斤，博昌五金行报价每斤三千六百元得标，在送货时，验收人员硬说货物不好，不收。后来和这些验收人员有关系的隆昌五金行把货送去，他们就按每斤五千二百五十元转送总厂收下了。这一次，国家财产就损失了三百七十多万元。他们这样的集体贪污受贿，就使国家财产遭受了五千多万元的损失。他们经常验收材料“以劣报优”，过磅“以少报多”的损失还不在内。
    以上情况由群众告发，经山东省人民监察委员会检查属实，已在今年七月间予以处理。长期集体贪污舞弊的丁梦西等已由厂方停职，并送法院法办。行贿的奸商，也已交司法机关依法惩处。

    辽西绥中县长王哲
    铺张浪费挪用公款受到处分
    辽西省绥中县县长王哲挪用公款、公物，铺张浪费，贪图自私享受。一九五○年秋天，上级政府决定在绥中县建立伤兵医院一所。县长王哲不但没有积极筹办，反而为了满足他个人生活上的享受，乘机擅自挪用伤兵医院的开办费两亿三千多万元，替他本单位盖新式房子十八间和小楼两间。还有，王哲在省里参加整风会议时，听说县的公营汽车要交给省办，他回县后马上就把两辆公营汽车换上县府的牌子。后来，他又怕一个县政府有两辆汽车，还要抽调，就私自把汽车卖去一辆，得款一千四百多万元。他用这份款买了五套沙发，分给县委两套，公安局一套，自己留用两套。这些事情已说明王哲不顾全面只管本位，竟然挪用公款、公物，铺张浪费，贪图享受。为了教育王哲和避免国家财物再受损失，辽西省人民政府人民监察委员会在今年八月间，已给王哲记大过两次。

    川东?都县高镇区粮库干部
    违反规定浪费国家资财
    川东?都县高镇区粮库干部违反规定、浪费国家资财。一九五○年底，这个区的粮库干部擅自挪用一九五一年的建仓大米八万多斤，修建加工场、宿舍、办公室、浴室等不急需的建筑，并且购买了不急需的最新式精致的办公桌、木床、文件柜等。他们又在楼房前建筑了一百五十尺长的一道围墙，前后费时四月之久，共用去大米九万多斤、人民币五百多万元。在进行这些工程中，他们又擅自拆毁庙房、砍伐森林，并且动员群众捐献木材、砖瓦等。使用材料时，他们又大材小用、精材粗用。川东人民行政公署人民监察委员会已经检查了这些粮库干部的违法行为，正在处理。

    东北某军工厂领导干部
    思想麻痹造成工厂失火
    国家资财受到巨大损失
    东北某军工厂职员尹文科怠忽职务和厂里领导干部的官僚主义，造成国家财产巨大损失，已分别受到处分。本年二月六日（夏历正月初一日），东北某军工厂在市区的一个戏院开“奖模大会”，厂里大部分人都去参加，留下少数职工担任护厂工作。领导干部布置不够认真，留厂人员也就对护厂任务没有重视。如留厂职员尹文科，值班六小时半，除两次到厕所外，全部时间都在值班室内睡觉。厂房失火了，他一点都不知道，直到火势已大，才被巡逻员发现（起火原因还在调查中）。又因为这个厂平素防火准备很差，所以火警发生时，大家一片混乱，不能及时抢救。结果烧毁了八百一十平方米的厂房全部、电机和其他机器的三分之一，另外三分之二也遭到损伤。共损失人民币九十八亿七千七百三十六万三千元。至于因火灾而停工的损失，更是无法估计。这次火灾的发生，尹文科的怠忽职务应负主要责任，但某军工厂领导干部平时对工厂的防护工作重视不够、检查不严和思想麻痹，也是造成失火的重要原因。东北人民政府工业部决定，分别给予这个厂的正副厂长任中浩、吴从柯撤职和记大过处分，把尹文科撤职法办，并分别给予其他有关人员以处分。政务院人民监察委员会通讯组
