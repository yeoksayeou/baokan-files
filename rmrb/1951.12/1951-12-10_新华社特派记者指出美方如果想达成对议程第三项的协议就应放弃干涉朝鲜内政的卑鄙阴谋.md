    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 9th: This agency's special correspondent reports: The main differences in the discussions on ceasefire and armistice methods at the Korean armistice negotiation conference in recent days are illustrating which side hopes to achieve a stable ceasefire and an early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    Observers here believe that the U.S. side insists on its "replacement and replenishment" or so-called "rotation system," which is used to continue the Korean War, the purpose of which is only to delay the withdrawal of foreign troops during the armistice and delay the final resolution of the Korean issue.
    This sinister purpose is made even more obvious by the U.S. demand to restrict military equipment. The purpose of this demand is to forcibly "freeze" the airfields completely, a goal they have previously failed to achieve through bombing. Obviously, this "freezing" of military equipment is intended to allow the U.S. Air Force to continue bombing North Korean cities and villages from existing South Korean airfields whenever they choose. This is the real reason why the U.S. insists on interfering with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's right to handle its own military equipment according to its own will. This is why the U.S. is demanding aerial and photographic reconnaissance, demanding that their personnel have "free access to all of Korea."
    The Korean-Chinese side representatives have firmly stated that they will reject all demands for interference in internal affairs. If the U.S. insists on these unacceptable demands, it can only delay the negotiations and waste the remaining valuable time.
    The U.S. demand to continue maintaining a "rotation system" raises the question: if Washington really wants a ceasefire as a step towards achieving peace as soon as possible, why would it want to transport new troops, new weapons, and more ammunition to Korea? The Korean-Chinese side is prepared to fulfill its Sixth Principle—no longer transporting more troops, more weapons, and more ammunition into Korea—because it firmly advocates seeking a peaceful resolution quickly after the military armistice.
    Observers point out: the more the U.S. insists on "replacing and replenishing" its troops in Korea, the more they expose to the people of the world that they are planning to stay in Korea for a long time and postpone holding a high-level conference to end the state of war for a long time.
    Who is willing to prohibit the transport of troops and military supplies into Korea, reduce them, and finally withdraw them—this is the decisive test of who hopes to achieve a stable ceasefire and an early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The U.S. has not withstood these tests, despite saying verbally that it hopes to "not amass military forces" to ensure that the war does not recur. In the words of the U.S. chief representative, Joy, the U.S. wants a "lasting armistice." This "lasting armistice" means a lasting state of war, a lasting state of tension serving the hidden purposes of Washington and Wall Street.
    At the current stage of the armistice negotiations, the issues are sharp and clear. If the U.S. truly hopes to achieve a stable ceasefire and an early peaceful resolution, it should immediately accept the principle of not transporting troops, weapons, and ammunition into Korea during the armistice. If they do not want to delay an agreement on item three of the agenda, they should no longer insist on unacceptable demands for interference in internal affairs and accept the principle of neutral countries inspecting both sides' rear areas. Whether the U.S. is sincere in quickly and fairly resolving the third item on the agenda will be judged by their response to these unresolved issues.

### 新华社特派记者指出美方如果想达成对议程第三项的协议就应放弃干涉朝鲜内政的卑鄙阴谋

    新华社特派记者指出
    美方如果想达成对议程第三项的协议
    就应放弃干涉朝鲜内政的卑鄙阴谋
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜停战谈判会议几天来对停火和停战办法的讨论中的主要分歧，正在向人们说明哪一方面希望实现稳定的停战和早日和平解决朝鲜问题。
    此间观察家认为：美方所以坚持他们的用来继续进行朝鲜战争的“替换和补充”或所谓“轮换制”，其目的只是为了在停战期间延不撤退外国军队和拖延朝鲜问题的最后解决。
    这个阴险的目的由于美方要求限制军事设备而更加明显。这个要求的目的是想强使飞机场完全“冻结”，这个目的是他们从前用滥炸的手段所没有能达到的。显然，这种“冻结”军事设备，是想使美国空军能够继续在他们任意选择的时候从现有的南朝鲜飞机场起飞继续轰炸朝鲜北部的城市和乡村。这就是美方坚持要干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国按照自己的意志处理自己的军事设备的权利的真正原因。这就是美方为什么要求进行空中和摄影侦察，要求他们的人员可以“自由出入朝鲜全境”的原因。
    朝中方面代表已坚决表示，他们将拒绝一切干涉内政的要求。如果美方坚持这些难以接受的要求，就只能拖延谈判，浪费剩下的宝贵时间。
    美方的关于继续保持“轮换制”的要求引起了这样的问题：如果华盛顿方面真想停战，作为早日获致和平的一个步骤，为什么它要把新的军队、新的武器和更多的弹药运到朝鲜来呢？朝中方面准备履行它的第六项原则——不再把更多的军队、更多的武器和更多的弹药运入朝鲜，因为它坚主在军事停战之后应迅速求得和平解决。
    观察家指出：美方愈坚持“替换和补充”他们在朝鲜的军队，他们就愈向世界人民暴露他们正在计划长期留在朝鲜，并且长期延不举行结束战争状态的高级会议。
    谁愿意禁止军队和军火运入朝鲜、削减它们、最后并撤退它们——这就是谁希望实现稳定的停战和早日和平解决朝鲜问题的决定性考验。而美方没有经得起这些考验，尽管他们口头上说希望“不集结军事力量”以保证战事不致再起。用美方首席代表乔埃的话说，美方想要一个“持久的停战”。这个“持久的停战”就意味着持久的战争状态，为华盛顿和华尔街的不可告人的目的服务的持久的紧张状态。
    在停战谈判的目前阶段，问题是尖锐而且明确的。如果美方真的希望求得稳定的停战和早日的和平解决，他们就应立即接受在停战期间不把军队、武器和弹药运入朝鲜的原则。如果他们不想延缓对议程第三项的协议，他们就应不再坚持干涉内政的难以接受的要求，接受由中立国到双方后方视察的原则。美方是否有诚意迅速而公平地解决议程中的第三项，将要由他们对这些尚未解决的问题的答复来判断。
