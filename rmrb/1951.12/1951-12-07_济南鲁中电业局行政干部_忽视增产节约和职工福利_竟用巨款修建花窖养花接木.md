    Jinan Luzhong Electric Power Bureau Administrative Cadres
    Neglect Production Increase, Savings, and Employee Welfare
    Spend Huge Sums to Build Flower Cellars for Flower Cultivation and Grafting
    Editor: Since the Jinan Luzhong Electric Power Bureau's various workshops, groups, and individuals have launched the production increase and savings campaign, they have generally formulated two-month production increase and savings plans. According to preliminary statistics, the value of production increases and savings could reach one to two billion yuan by the end of the year. However, the administrative side of the bureau not only lacks leadership in this campaign but also exhibits wasteful practices. Concurrently with the launch of the production increase and savings campaign, administrative cadres, without the consent of the employees, built two flower cellars, costing over ten million yuan, to prepare for goldfish and flowers to survive the winter. Before this, the administrative side had already hired flower masters to specialize in flower cultivation and grafting. They show no regard for the welfare of the employees. The Power Supply Section has over a hundred employees, but there is only one small toilet that can accommodate only three people, so workers have to schedule shifts for urination and defecation every day. The bureau's cafeteria is very narrow, accommodating a maximum of forty people, but each time four hundred people need to eat, and workers have to wait for more than half an hour to get their meals. Employees have repeatedly requested improvements on these issues, but they have never been resolved. Now, everyone is saying, "We need to solve the 'eating' and 'defecation' problems, not admire flowers and goldfish." Due to the existence of these problems, the production increase and savings campaign has been hindered. Therefore, I suggest that the administrative leaders of the bureau quickly correct their mistakes. 	  Ze Ming

    Editor's Note: The serious waste and bureaucratic style of the administrative cadres of the Luzhong Electric Power Bureau is intolerable and should be seriously reviewed. The competent authorities of the Electric Power Bureau should seriously investigate and promptly handle this matter.

    济南鲁中电业局行政干部
    忽视增产节约和职工福利
    竟用巨款修建花窖养花接木
    编辑同志：济南鲁中电业局各车间、各组和个人自开展增产节约运动以来，都已普遍订出了两个月的增产节约计划。据初步统计，增产节约的价值至年底可达一二十亿元。但该局行政方面对这一运动不但领导不够，而且更有浪费现象。与开展增产节约运动同时，行政干部不经职工同意，就修建两座花窖，以备金鱼和花草过冬，共花费了一千万元以上。在这以前，行政方面已雇好了花师傅，专门搞养花接木工作。他们对职工的福利工作则毫不重视。供电科有职工百人以上，但仅有只能容纳三人的小厕所一所，因而工人每天都要为大小便排班。该局的食堂很狭窄，最多能容四十人，但每次要有四百人吃饭，工人须等候半小时以上才能领到饭菜。职工们对这些问题曾一再要求改善，可是始终未获解决。现在，大家都在说：“我们需要解决
    ‘吃饭’和‘大便’问题，不需要欣赏花草金鱼。”由于以上这些问题的存在，增产节约运动就遭到了阻碍。因此，我建议该局行政领导方面迅速纠正错误。            则鸣
    编者按：鲁中电业局行政干部这种严重的浪费现象和官僚主义作风是令人不能容忍的，应作严肃的检讨。该电业局的主管机关应认真检查和迅速处理。
