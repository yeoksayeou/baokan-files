To the dear compatriots of the motherland:

After returning to the front, we reported to the various units on the situation of the motherland's resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, as well as the boundless love and hope of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer Army. We are warmly welcomed by the comrades in the units every day. Everywhere they ask for more news from the motherland. They say: Seeing us is like seeing hundreds of millions of people in the motherland.

When we went to a certain unit to report, the comrades there ran several miles to welcome us, shouting from afar: "They're here, back from the motherland!" The female comrades ran and jumped around us, presenting bouquets of wildflowers. Blue and white small flowers were mixed with fiery red maple leaves, which they had specially picked from the mountains. Upon meeting, everyone hugged us, lifted us up, and surrounded us asking: "Did you see Chairman Mao? Is he healthy?" We replied: "Chairman Mao is very healthy. He is also very concerned about the health of the comrades at the front!" Everyone cheered. We were welcomed to the "Battlefield Home" with numbered doorplates of the comrades. Along the way, everyone kept asking: "How is the Huai River being repaired?" "Where has the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway reached?" ... Every piece of news from the motherland is of the greatest concern to everyone.

At the venue where the comrades welcomed us, a colored gate was set up, with rain tarpaulins forming the walls, hung with portraits of Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung, and large slogans pasted on stretcher beds. Loudspeakers were installed in the tree branches. Sometimes, the reports were carried out under the disturbance of enemy aircraft. Although the enemy aircraft sometimes flew overhead, everyone ignored it. Once, a report was given in the heavy rain, and everyone put on rain tarpaulins and took notes on their knees.

The patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the motherland has moved many cadres and soldiers. Yang Jincai, a soldier in a certain unit, upon hearing that the rubber factory was suffering to make shoes, launched a "shoe repair campaign." The comrades in the supply station launched a "grain sweeping campaign" to save materials. After hearing that the seventy-year-old man Tan Chuyun carried water for donation, a feeder in a certain unit guaranteed to take care of the horse feed in the future. Many units and soldiers have checked and revised their meritorious service plans.

At the front, the lives of the soldiers are very hard, but the great spirit of patriotism and internationalism encourages us, and everyone is very happy. The soldiers say: We "eat whatever we have, and have whatever we eat." The supplies the motherland sends to support us include peanuts, soybeans, kelp, egg powder, and various canned foods. The variety of supplies is so rich that we can say we eat whatever we have. However, in special circumstances, our troops eat whatever is available. For example, a certain unit ate wild vegetables this summer. A direct subordinate unit of a certain unit ate half a catty of flour per person every day and made dumplings - stuffed with wild vegetables. The soldiers also used fried noodles and white flour to make flower rolls, and ground rice to make dumpling wrappers. The tenth company of a certain artillery regiment held a celebration meeting in Liulin and made eighteen dishes, including wild leeks, daylilies, pig teeth vegetables, mulberry leaves, etc. I have stayed in a bomb shelter built by the soldiers themselves. The roof of the house was covered with captured enemy parachutes, and the four walls were made of sorghum stalks woven into flowered walls, with portraits of Chairman Mao and various pictures cut from pictorials hanging on the walls. There was a neat heated kang in the house. The soldiers told me with a smile: "This is much better than last year, we now have 'heating equipment'." The soldiers also made small benches and "earthen sofas" out of the wooden boxes containing comfort goods. At the entrance of the bomb shelter, red and yellow wild fruits were inlaid in the mud to form the couplet "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea," "Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country." A small path was built with pine branches. There were also small playgrounds and clubs near the bomb shelter. I visited the wall newspapers in the club. Some soldiers wrote clapper rhymes using mulberry leaves, and others used water squeezed from pine branches to make their own ink. There are few radios in the company, but the soldiers love to listen to the radio. This year, the soldiers squeezed in to listen to the live broadcast from Beijing on National Day. When they heard Chairman Mao and the central leaders walk onto the rostrum, they all applauded enthusiastically.

Now, the fighting spirit in the troops is even higher. Everyone has made concrete plans for meritorious service, ready to crush the attacks of the U.S. invading army at any time, and respond to the love of the people of the motherland with new victories.

### 当祖国人民的爱国热情传到朝鲜前线的时候——志愿军归国代表嵇炳前在朝鲜前线写给祖国人民的信

    当祖国人民的爱国热情传到朝鲜前线的时候
    ——志愿军归国代表嵇炳前在朝鲜前线写给祖国人民的信亲爱的祖国的同胞们：
    我们回到前线以后，即将祖国抗美援朝情况以及祖国人民对志愿军的无比热爱和希望，向各部队作报告。我们每天都受到部队中同志们的热烈欢迎。到处要求多讲些祖国的消息。他们说：见了我们，就等于见了祖国亿万人民。
    我们到某部队作报告时，那里的同志跑出几里路来欢迎，很远地就叫着：“来了，从祖国回来了。”女同志连跑带跳地围上来，献上一束束的野花。蓝白色的小花夹着火红的枫叶，这是她们特地从山上采来的。见了面，大家就把我们抱起来，抬起来，围着问：“见了毛主席么？他健康吗？”我们回答：“毛主席很健康。他还很关心前方同志们的健康！”大家都欢呼起来。我们被欢迎到战友们标有门牌号数的“战地之家”。一路上大家不停地问：“淮河修得怎样？”“成渝铁路通到那里了？”……祖国的每一个消息，都是大家所最关心的。
    在战友们欢迎我们的会场上搭起了彩门，用雨布结成围墙，挂上毛主席和金日成将军的像，用担架床贴上很大的标语，在树杈中装上扩音喇叭。有时，报告会在敌机的扰乱下进行，尽管敌机有时飞过头上，大家也不理会它。有一次报告是在大雨中进行的，大家都披上雨布，在膝盖上做笔记。
    祖国人民的爱国热情，感动了很多干部和战士。某部战士杨进才，听到橡胶工厂做鞋那样苦，就发起了“补鞋运动”。兵站同志发起了“扫粮运动”来节约物资。某部饲养员听到七十多岁的老人谭楚云挑水捐献后，保证以后要爱护马料。许多单位和战士纷纷检查和增订了自己的立功计划。
    在前方，战士们的生活是非常艰苦的，但伟大的爱国主义和国际主义的精神鼓舞着我们，大家都很愉快。战士们说：我们是“吃啥有啥，有啥吃啥”。祖国支援我们的物资里有花生、黄豆、海带、蛋粉和各种罐头，支援的东西种类太丰富了，所以说吃啥有啥。然而，在特殊情况下，我们部队是有什么就吃什么。例如，某部队今年夏季曾吃过野菜。某部直属队每天每人半斤面还包饺子吃——里面包的野菜。战士还用炒面加白面摺成花卷，大米磨面包饺子。炮兵某团十连在柳林里开庆功会，还做了十八个菜，其中有野韭菜、黄花菜、猪牙菜、桑树叶等等。我住过战士自己修的防空洞。屋内顶上覆盖着缴获的敌人降落伞，四面是用高粱秆编成的带花的墙，壁上挂着毛主席像和各种画报上剪下来的画片。屋内有整齐的热炕。战士笑着告诉我：“这比去年进步多了，我们现在已经有了‘暖气设备’了。”战士们还用装慰劳品的木箱子做成小板凳、“土沙发”。在防空洞门口，用红的黄的野果子镶在泥内，砌成“抗美援朝”“保家卫国”的对联。用松枝修成小路。防空洞附近还有小的游戏场、俱乐部。我参观了俱乐部里的墙报。有的战士用桑树的叶子写快板，还有用松枝挤出的水自造的墨水。在连队里很少有收音机，但战士们最爱听广播。今年国庆节北京的实况广播，战士都挤着听，听到毛主席和中央各首长走上主席台，都热烈地鼓掌。
    现在，部队中的战斗情绪更加高涨了。每个人都订了具体的立功计划，准备随时粉碎美国侵略军的进攻，以新的战斗胜利，来回答祖国人民的热爱。
       志愿军归国代表  嵇炳前
            十一月二十二日
