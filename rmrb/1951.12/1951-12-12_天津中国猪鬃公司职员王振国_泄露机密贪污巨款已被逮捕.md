    Wang Zhenguo, Employee of Tianjin China Bristle Company, Arrested for Leaking Secrets and Embezzling Huge Sums of Money
    Wang Zhenguo (born a rogue merchant), an employee of Tianjin China Bristle Company, has been arrested and brought to justice for leaking state secrets and embezzling large sums of money. According to Wang's confession, in addition to leaking price secrets to unscrupulous merchants, he privately telegraphed materials related to the pig bristle business to other places as many as 200 times from 1950 to January 6, 1951, causing incalculable political and economic losses. He also altered 194 receipts, embezzling a total of 72,822,860 yuan. Wang was arrested and brought to justice after being reported by the telegraph bureau. Wang had been engaged in leaking state secrets and embezzling illegal activities for eight or nine months, but the leading cadres and relevant responsible personnel did not notice it. This bureaucratic work style should arouse great vigilance in all regions and departments. Central People's Supervisory Committee Communications Group

    天津中国猪鬃公司职员王振国
    泄露机密贪污巨款已被逮捕
    天津中国猪鬃公司职员王振国（流氓商人出身），泄露国家机密，贪污大批款项，已被捕法办。据王犯供称，除泄露物价机密给奸商外，自一九五○年至一九五一年一月六日止，把和猪鬃业务有关的材料私自向外地拍电报计二百份之多，造成政治上及经济上无法估计的损失。他又涂改了收款单据一百九十四张，贪污款项共达七千二百八十二万二千八百六十元。经电报局检举，王犯才被捕法办。王犯进行泄露国家机密、贪污违法活动已有八、九个月，而领导干部及有关负责人员竟没有发觉，这种官僚主义作风是应当引起各地及各机关十分警惕的。中央人民监察委员会通讯组
