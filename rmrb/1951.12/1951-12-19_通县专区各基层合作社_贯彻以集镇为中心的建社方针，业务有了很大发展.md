To the Editor:

The cooperatives in various parts of Tongxian Special District have taken on a completely new look and have greatly developed their business after implementing the policy of building cooperatives centered on market towns and carrying out rectification and mergers. According to statistics, some grassroots cooperatives in eleven counties, including Changping and Daxing, had only fifteen sales departments before the merger, but now they have increased to twenty-three, and the number of processing workshops has also increased from eighteen to forty-three; before the merger, there were an average of only one hundred and twenty-seven kinds of commodities, but now they have increased to two hundred and seventy-four; before the merger, the average monthly transaction volume was more than 955 million yuan, but after the merger, it increased by nearly two and a half times in October. Among them, eleven grassroots cooperatives, including Mashanqiao, can now meet more than 50% of the needs of their members. Furthermore, because the business of these cooperatives is improving and expanding day by day, the number of members has also increased. According to the statistics of thirteen grassroots cooperatives in Tongxian Special District: before the merger, there were 50,859 members, but after the merger, the number had increased to 86,715 in October. All of these facts prove that the policy of building cooperatives centered on market towns in rural areas is correct.

However, because the development of cooperatives is very rapid, some new problems have also arisen. For example, after the merger, the types of goods have increased and the prices have become cheaper, so members are willing to buy things in the cooperatives, but the share capital of each member is only ten jin of millet, which leads to a feeling of insufficient funds. Also, problems have arisen because the business organization is not commensurate with the development of members. Members of the Niubao Village Cooperative in Tongxian have to queue up to buy salt, and they reflect that "although the goods are cheap, it is not worthwhile to spend time on it." This has led some members to buy goods from private merchants. In addition, the democratic system has been relaxed in some cooperatives after the merger. The Shahe Lian Village Cooperative has not held a meeting of directors and supervisors for five months after the rectification. I think the above problems must be brought to attention, and experience must be explored in the work to gradually improve, so as to consolidate the results of the rectification and better serve the members.

### 通县专区各基层合作社  贯彻以集镇为中心的建社方针，业务有了很大发展

    通县专区各基层合作社
    贯彻以集镇为中心的建社方针，业务有了很大发展
    编辑同志：通县专区各地合作社在贯彻以集镇为中心的建社方针，实行整社并社以后，面貌焕然一新，在业务方面有了很大发展。据统计，昌平、大兴等十一个县的某些基层社，并社前只有十五个门市部，现已增加到二十三个，加工作坊也由十八个增加到四十三个；并社前平均只有一百二十七种商品，现已增加到二百七十四种；并社前平均一个月的交易额是九亿五千五百多万元，并社后，在十月份就增加了近两倍半，其中马伸桥等十一个基层社已能解决社员的需要达百分之五十以上。又因为这些社的业务日益改进和扩大，社员的数量也增加了。据通县专区十三个基层社的材料统计：并社前有社员五万零八百五十九人，并社后十月份已增加到八万六千七百十五人。以上这些事实都证明在农村以集镇为中心的建社方针是正确的。
    但是，因为合作社发展很快，也产生了一些新的问题。如并社后，货物种类增多，价钱又便宜，社员都愿到合作社里买东西，而社员每股的股金只十斤小米，以致感到资金不足。又，业务机构与社员的发展不相称，也发生了问题。通县牛堡屯合作社的社员买盐要排队等着，他们反映说：“货虽贱，搭上时间就不合算了。”这样就使得部分社员向私商买货了。此外，有些社在合并后，民主制度松懈了，沙河联村社整社后，已有五个月没开过理、监事会。我认为以上的问题，必须引起注意，并在工作中摸索经验，逐步改进，以巩固整社成绩，更好地为社员服务。
