    Beijing Democratic Parties Hold Joint Meeting to Respond to Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing municipal organizations of various democratic parties held a joint meeting on the 13th to discuss how to respond to the call of Chairman Peng Zhen of the Municipal Consultative Committee and launch an anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign. The heads of the municipal-level organizations of the various democratic parties attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Jiang Guangnai, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. Li Leguang, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Deputy Minister Cui Yueli were also invited to attend. At the meeting, the heads of the various democratic parties spoke one after another, actively expressing their desire to lead the members of their organizations to take action and wage a ruthless struggle against corruption and waste, and to foster a spirit of cherishing state property.
    Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, explained the importance of opposing corruption and waste. Wen Jiasi, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, said: "Although the members of the various democratic parties are not numerous, they have extensive connections with the masses. We must use the spirit of 'fighting the yellow wolf' to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign." Ling Qijun, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: "The phenomena of bribery and acceptance of bribes often occur between industrial and commercial households and government cadres. The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce is now educating industrial and commercial households. It is hoped that through this mass movement, the bad habits left over from the old society will be eliminated!" Then, Mo Yichang, a member of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, cited a case of cadre corruption recently discovered within the association, explaining that internal inspections must be carried out seriously within the various democratic parties. Wang Jiyi, a member of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: "Our various democratic parties should first study the documents, then hold criticism meetings, call on corrupt elements to confess, and incorporate the savings plan into the patriotic pact. At the same time, we should cooperate with the people's governments at all levels to widely publicize the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing corruption and waste among the masses." Zhang Dazhong, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, said: "In the past, we were very numb ideologically to the idea of extravagance and waste. Recently, after an inspection, we discovered many inappropriate phenomena. When the masses are mobilized, everyone can realize that even the smallest things should be paid attention to in order to save money; otherwise, little things add up and waste a lot of people's property!" Xue Yu, Director of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society, said: "Some people feel that the democratic parties have no way to increase production and practice economy. This view is wrong. Many members of the China Democratic National Construction Association are directly engaged in production, and most of the party members or members of other parties also participate in national construction work. Therefore, they should take the lead in leading the masses to increase production and practice economy. Corrupt elements should be educated and severely punished. In terms of anti-waste, we should also pay attention to small things, and not buy or use too much of anything." Shen Yifan, a member of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, proposed that anti-waste should improve work efficiency and develop the habit of attending meetings on time. Chen Mingshao, a director of the Jiusan Society, Su Congzhou, a member of the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Wen Chongshi, a member of the Beijing Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, all unanimously supported the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign in their speeches. At the meeting, Li Leguang, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke. In addition to explaining the important significance of increasing production and practicing economy, he also hoped that the comrades of the various democratic parties would mobilize and organize themselves to greet this movement with a positive attitude.
    Finally, Jiang Guangnai concluded: "The various democratic parties must take action and launch a large-scale anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign. We should seriously study the documents, call on corrupt elements to confess, and report corrupt elements, and incorporate the opposition to corruption and waste into the patriotic pact. At the same time, the members of the various democratic parties should improve work efficiency and actively respond to Chairman Mao's call!" (Wang Jing)

    北京市各民主党派组织举行联席会议
    响应开展反贪污反浪费运动
    【本报讯】北京市各民主党派组织在十三日举行联席会议，讨论如何响应市协商委员会彭真主席的号召，开展反贪污反浪费运动问题。各民主党派市级负责人都出席了会议。会议由中国国民党革命委员会北京市分会主任委员蒋光鼐主持。中共北京市委统一战线工作部部长李乐光、副部长崔月犁也应邀出席。会上，各民主党派负责人纷纷发言，积极表示要领导自己组织的成员行动起来，和贪污浪费现象作无情的斗争，并树立爱护国家财产的风气。
    中国农工民主党北京市分会主任委员彭泽民说明了反对贪污、反对浪费的重要性。中国民主同盟北京市支部副主任委员闻家驷说：“各民主党派的成员虽然不多，可是与群众有广泛的联系，要用‘打黄狼’的精神，来进行反贪污反浪费运动。”民主建国会北京市分会副主任委员凌其峻说：“行贿、受贿现象往往发生在工商户和机关干部之间，北京市工商联现在正对工商户进行教育，希望通过这次群众性运动，消灭旧社会留下来的坏风气！”接着民主建国会北京市分会委员莫艺昌举出会内最近发现的一件干部贪污案子，说明各民主党派内部必须认真进行检查。农工民主党北京市分会委员王寄一说：“我们各民主党派应该先学习文件，然后开检讨会，号召贪污分子坦白，并且把节约计划订到爱国公约里去。同时，应配合各级人民政府，在群众中广泛宣传增产节约、反贪污浪费的意义。”新民主主义青年团北京市委员会副书记张大中说：“以前我们对铺张浪费思想上是很麻痹的。最近检查了一次，发现许多不应有的现象。群众发动起来了，大家就能认识到：即使是一点一滴的小事，也应注意节约；否则积少成多，就浪费很多人民财产！”九三学社北京市分会主任理事薛愚说：“有人觉得民主党派没有办法增产节约，这种看法是错误的。民主建国会的许多会员就是直接搞生产的，其他党派的党员或社员也多参加了国家建设工作，因此，应该带头领导群众进行增产节约。对贪污分子应进行教育和严惩。在反浪费方面，也应注意小事情，一切用品，不滥买也不多买，不滥用也不多用。”民主同盟北京市支部委员沈一帆提出：反浪费应该提高工作效率，并且要养成准时开会的习惯。九三学社理事陈明绍、中国国民党革命委员会北京市分会委员苏从周、民主促进会北京市分会委员温崇实等在发言中，一致拥护开展反贪污反浪费运动。会上，中共北京市委员会统一战线工作部部长李乐光发言，他在说明了增产节约的重要意义外，并希望各民主党派的同志们动员起来，组织起来，以积极的态度来迎接这个运动。
    最后，蒋光鼐总结说：“各民主党派要行动起来，大规模地展开反贪污反浪费运动。我们应该认真学习文件，号召贪污分子坦白，并检举贪污分子，把反对贪污浪费订到爱国公约里。同时，各民主党派的组织成员，要提高工作效率，积极响应毛主席的号召！”　（王敬）
