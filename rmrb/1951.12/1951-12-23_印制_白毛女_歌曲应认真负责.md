    Printing of "The White Haired Girl" Songs Should Be Done Responsibly

    Editor: Our publishing house previously published "The White Haired Girl Song Collection" (电影白毛女歌曲集). Recently, many pirated editions have appeared in Shanghai, Beijing, and other places, and the editing and printing have been extremely irresponsible. For example, the Shanghai Worker-Peasant-Soldier Readers Publishing House's "New Movie Songs" (电影新歌), "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Songs" (工农兵歌声), the World Book and Newspaper Agency's "Ten Thousand Li Songs" (万里歌声), and the "New Era Song Selection" (新时代歌曲选) distributed by the Tianxia Publishing House all include interludes from "The White Haired Girl." Most of these song collections do not include the names of the lyricists, and the printing and production are very crude, especially with many errors and omissions in the musical notation. Furthermore, the "White Haired Girl Songs" published by the Beijing Xinguang Bookstore also contain many errors. These phenomena demonstrate that some publishers are not responsible enough to their readers, and that there is an unhealthy trend of speculation and a purely profit-driven mentality. To maintain the correctness and integrity of "The White Haired Girl Song Collection," in addition to immediately publishing the fourth edition, we have a responsibility to expose these chaotic situations.

### 印制“白毛女”歌曲应认真负责

    印制“白毛女”歌曲应认真负责
    编辑同志：本社曾出版“电影白毛女歌曲集”一种。最近上海、北京等地，出现了许多翻印本，编印极不负责。像上海工农兵读物出版社的“电影新歌”、“工农兵歌声”，世界书报社的“万里歌声”、天下出版社经售的“新时代歌曲选”，都附有“白毛女”插曲。这些歌集大部分没有作词者的名字，而在印刷、制版上都非常粗糙，特别是乐谱符号上有许多错误和遗漏的地方。再像北京新光书店出版的“白毛女歌曲”，内容也有很多错误。这些现象说明了一部分出版商对读者不够认真负责，存在着投机取巧的歪风和单纯营利的观点。我们为了保持“白毛女歌曲集”的正确和完整，除即行出版第四版本外，有责任对这些混乱情况加以揭露。
