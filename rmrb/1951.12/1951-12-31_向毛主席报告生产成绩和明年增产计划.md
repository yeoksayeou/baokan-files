Fifteen State-owned Farms and Tianjin Tractor Station
Report to Chairman Mao on Production Achievements and Next Year's Production Increase Plan
The Experimental Farm and Wulidian Farm Set Records for High Yields of Upland Cotton Over Large Areas, Demonstrating the Superiority of State-owned Farms

Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the representatives of fifteen state-owned farms and one tractor station, recently summarized our work in 1951 at the Mechanized Farming School of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in the eastern suburbs of Beijing and proposed a production increase plan for 1952.

Our fifteen state-owned farms and one tractor station were established for a short time, but with the efforts of all farm workers, we have accumulated some experience and achieved certain results. For example, the Experimental Farm of the Mechanized Farming School planted 944 mu of upland cotton this year and achieved a high yield of 296 jin of seed cotton per mu on average; the Wulidian Farm planted 2,620 mu of upland cotton and also achieved an average yield of 215 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 80% compared with 1950, exceeding the average yield of upland cotton of nearby farmers by two to three times, initially demonstrating the superiority of state-owned farms. In terms of total output, the average total output of each farm increased by 58% this year compared with last year, and the average output per unit area increased by 38%. These achievements are inseparable from your wise leadership.

Experience over the past year has proven that our state-owned farms must learn from the Soviet farm's crop rotation system with forage crops in large fields to improve yields and reduce costs. In order to improve the management of the farms and strengthen the planning and scientific nature of the farms, we have formulated production plans and financial plans, organizational regulations, rules and regulations for agriculture, machinery, finance, capital construction, and reward and punishment systems for state-owned farms, which are some of the basic problems that need to be solved urgently by state-owned farms. On this basis, we have formulated a technical plan for crop cultivation for next year to increase the yield per unit area. According to this crop cultivation technical plan, the 1952 production increase plan of the Experimental Farm of the Mechanized Farming School guarantees an average yield of 450 jin of cotton per mu, the Wulidian Farm guarantees an average yield of 520 jin of cotton per mu, the Lutai Farm guarantees a yield of 700 jin of rice per mu, with a maximum yield of 1,400 jin, and the Fufeng Farm guarantees a yield of 230 jin of wheat per mu. In total, the cotton production of each farm will increase by 65% compared with 1950, rice production will increase by 73%, and wheat production will increase by 133%.

We, the representatives of each farm, enthusiastically responded to your great call to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" and realized the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy for strengthening national defense and economic construction. Therefore, we have carefully formulated production increase and economy plans based on the specific conditions of each farm, and have also proposed production increase and economy competitions with each other. In terms of increasing production, in addition to the above-mentioned increase in output per unit area, in terms of total income, in 1952, each farm guarantees to increase income by a total of 25,829.89 million yuan, an increase of 90% compared with 1951. In terms of economy, each farm will save a total of 2,793.74 million yuan throughout the year. The two items total 28,623.63 million yuan, which is an increase of 119% compared with the total income in 1951.

With highest respect!
Representatives of the Experimental Farm of the Mechanized Farming School of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and representatives of the State-owned Lutai, Wulidian, Hangu, Jiheng, Yongnian, Baoding, Jinyuan, Zhongtan, Dongxin, Pujixu, Lingwu, Fufeng, Bo'ai, Huang Fan District Farms and the Tianjin Tractor Station of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.

    十五个国营农场和天津拖拉机站
    向毛主席报告生产成绩和明年增产计划
    实习农场、五里店农场创大面积旱地棉花高额产量纪录，显示了国营农场的优越性敬爱的毛主席：
    我们十五个国营农场和一个拖拉机站的代表，最近在北京东郊中央人民政府农业部机耕学校总结了一九五一年的工作，并提出了一九五二年的增产计划。
    我们这十五个国营农场和一个拖拉机站成立的时间很短，但在农场全体职工的努力下，已经积累了一些经验，并创造了一定的成绩。如机耕学校实习农场今年播种了九百四十四亩旱地棉花，获得了平均产籽棉二百九十六斤的高额产量；五里店农场播种了二千六百二十亩旱地棉花，也获得了平均产籽棉二百一十五斤的产量，都比一九五○年增产了百分之八十，超过附近农民旱地棉花平均产量两三倍，开始显示了国营农场的优越性。在总的产量方面，各场总平均产量今年比去年提高了百分之五十八，单位面积产量平均提高了百分之三十八。这些成绩，都是和您的英明领导分不开的。
    一年来的经验证明，我们国营农场必须学习苏联农场牧草大田轮作制的经营方针，才能提高产量，降低成本。为了改进农场的经营，加强农场的计划性和科学性，我们这次制定了国营农场生产计划和财经计划、组织规程、农业、机务、财务、基本建设等规章及奖惩制度，这都是目前国营农场急须解决的一些基本问题。在这基础上，我们拟定了明年作物栽培的技术计划，以提高单位面积产量。根据这个作物栽培技术计划，机耕学校实习农场一九五二年增产计划保证棉花每亩平均产量为四百五十斤，五里店农场保证棉花每亩平均产量为五百二十斤，芦台农场保证水稻每亩产量为七百斤，最高产量一千四百斤，扶风农场保证小麦每亩产量二百三十斤。总计起来，各场棉花产量将比一九五○年增产百分之六十五，水稻增产百分之七十三，小麦增产百分之一百三十三。
    我们各场代表热烈响应您的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，认识了增产节约对于加强国防和经济建设的伟大意义。因此，我们根据各场具体情况，认真地制订了增产节约计划，互相间并提出了增产节约竞赛。在增产方面，除了上述的单位面积增产以外，在总的收入方面，一九五二年，各场总计保证增加收入二百五十八亿二千九百八十九万元，比一九五一年增加百分之九十。节约方面，各场全年总计要节约二十七亿九千三百七十四万元。两项共计二百八十六亿二千三百六十三万元，要比一九五一年的总收入增加百分之一百一十九。
    此致崇高的敬礼！中央人民政府农业部机耕学校实习农场、国营芦台、五里店、汉沽、冀衡、永年、保定、晋源、中滩、东辛、普济圩、灵武、扶风、博爱、黄泛区农场和中央人民政府农业部天津拖拉机站代表敬上
