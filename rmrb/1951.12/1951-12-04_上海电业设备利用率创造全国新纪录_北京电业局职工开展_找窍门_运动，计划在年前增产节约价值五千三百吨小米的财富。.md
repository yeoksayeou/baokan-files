Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd: Shanghai's electric power industry is continuously tapping its potential, increasing the equipment utilization rate from 53% in August to 62% in November, setting a new national record.

With the continued improvement of the economic situation, Shanghai's industrial demand for electricity is increasing daily. For example, in October of this year, the 129 factories approved to open by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau required 2,536 horsepower of electricity. Starting in November, cotton textile factories throughout the city launched a patriotic campaign to increase production, requiring even more electricity. Faced with this situation, Shanghai's electric power industry has made various efforts to tap the potential of existing equipment. These include planned equipment maintenance, unified scheduling of electricity throughout the city, reducing plant power consumption and line losses, and launching a campaign to save electricity among electricity users. Among these efforts, the achievements in adjusting load and increasing output are the most significant. To avoid all factories using electricity at the same time and increasing the power load of the power plant, the city's cotton industry has implemented a timed electricity consumption system this year. Starting in November this year, 14 larger industries, including paper, machinery, printing and dyeing, and rubber, have also implemented timed electricity consumption systems under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau. Since the unified arrangement of electricity consumption time, the imbalance caused by the high and low power load of the power plant has gradually been eliminated. Because the electricity that was idle during low load periods in the past has been utilized, it is virtually equivalent to adding 10,000 kilowatts of power equipment. At the same time, employees of the Shanghai Electric Power Company power plant, under the guidance of engineer Zhang Pengfei, have carried out many improvements in production. For example, in the past, it was stipulated that each generator would reduce its output by 3% when operating in parallel compared to operating individually, resulting in a loss of a lot of electricity; now, after reasonable scheduling and operation by the plant's employees, this difference has been eliminated, maximizing the efficiency of each generator. Another example is that the current limit is now determined by the daily temperature instead of being determined in advance, which has also increased the power supply. As a result of these improvements, the generating capacity of the Shanghai Electric Power Company power plant has increased by 9,000 kilowatts.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Employees of the Beijing Power Bureau, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and conservation, launched a "finding tricks" campaign, planning to increase production and save wealth worth 5,300 tons of millet for the country in the one and a half months from November 15th to the end of the year.

During the "finding tricks" campaign, the bureau's employees used their brains and came up with many ways to improve their work. The internal wiring construction team proposed to conduct intermediate inspections when installing internal wiring for users, helping users to solve the difficulties encountered during installation in a timely manner, advance the power supply, and increase income. The business section studied and simplified the application procedures, speeding up the application process. The power monitoring team has drafted a preliminary plan for adjusting the load, reducing the peak night load to 4,000 kilowatts before the Spring Festival, and rationally adjusting the weekly load, which can save 1,000 to 1,500 kilowatts of electricity per week. Everyone also came up with many ways to use waste products, and it is estimated that this item alone can save the country 735 tons of millet worth of wealth before the end of the year.

    上海电业设备利用率创造全国新纪录
    北京电业局职工开展“找窍门”运动，计划在年前增产节约价值五千三百吨小米的财富。
   【新华社上海三日电】上海市电力工业不断发挥潜在能力，使设备利用率由八月份的百分之五十三提高到十一月份的百分之六十二，创造了全国最高纪录。
    在经济情况继续好转的情况下，上海工业对电力的需要日益增加。以今年十月份来说，经上海市人民政府工商局核准开业的一百二十九家工厂，就需要二千五百三十六匹马力的电力。十一月份起，全市棉纺织工厂展开爱国主义突击增产运动，用电需要更多。面对这种情况，上海市电力工业在发挥现有设备的潜在能力方面，曾作了各种努力。如有计划地检修设备，统一调度全市电力，减少厂用电和线路损失以及在用电户中开展节约用电运动等等。在这些努力当中，调整负荷和提高出力的成绩最为显著。为避免各厂同时用电加重电厂的电力负荷，全市棉纺工业今年就已实行了定时用电制度。今年十一月份起，造纸、机器、印染、橡胶等十四个较大行业，在上海市人民政府公用局的领导下，也先后实行了定时用电制度。自从用电时间统一安排后，电厂电力负荷因时高时低所造成的不平衡现象已逐渐消除。因为利用了过去低负荷时闲着没有用的电力，无形中等于增添了一万瓩的电力设备。同时，上海电力公司发电厂职工在张鹏飞工程师指导下，进行了不少改进生产的工作。如过去规定各发电机在合并运行时较个别运行时减少出力百分之三，无形中损失许多电力；现在经过厂里职工合理的调度和运转，这个差额已经消除，发挥了每座发电机的最高效能。又如电流限额由事先排定改为按每天的气温来决定后，也增加了电力供应。经过这些改进，上海电力公司发电厂的发电能力已增加了九千瓩。
    【新华社三日讯】北京电业局职工响应毛主席增产节约号召，展开“找窍门”运动，计划在十一月十五日到年底的一个半月内，为国家增产节约五千三百吨小米的财富。
    该局职工在“找窍门”运动中开动脑筋，已经提出许多改进工作的办法。内线施工小组提出给用户安装内线时兼做中间检查，帮助用户及时解决安装中所遇到的困难，提前供电，增加收入。营业股研究了简化报装的手续，使报装过程加快。电力监查小组拟出了初步调整负荷的计划，在春节前把夜间高峰负荷降低到四千瓩，并合理调整周负荷，每周可以节省一千到一千五百瓩的电力。大家还想出许多利用废品的方法，仅这一项，估计年底以前就可以替国家节省七百三十五吨小米的财富。
