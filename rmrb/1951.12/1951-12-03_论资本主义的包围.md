    On Capitalist Encirclement
    Soviet U. Mikheev
    Editor's Note: Some readers of the Soviet "Bolshevik" magazine wrote to the editorial department of the magazine, requesting clarification on the issue of capitalist encirclement. Comrade Ushakov, a reader from Tbilisi, Georgian Republic, and Comrade Hoffman, a reader from Chortkov, Ukrainian Republic, asked: "Now that the international situation has undergone fundamental changes, can it be said that there is still capitalist encirclement?" Shi Liangjin, a reader from Moscow, and Morozov, a reader from Primorsky Krai, asked: "Is it correct to think that the concept of capitalist encirclement has lost its meaning and no longer exists, due to the victory of the people's democratic system in many countries bordering the Soviet Union?" This article is a response to the above questions.
    Capitalist encirclement is a political concept. Comrade Stalin pointed out that capitalist encirclement should not be regarded as a purely geographical concept. Comrade Stalin said at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1937: "Capitalist encirclement means that there is one country, the Soviet Union, which has established a socialist order within its own borders, and there are many other countries—namely, bourgeois countries—which continue to live in a capitalist way, and surround the Soviet Union, and wait for an opportunity to attack it, crush it, or in any case damage its power and weaken it."
    The simultaneous coexistence of two opposing social systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system—is the inevitable result of the development of the socialist revolution in the era of imperialism. As early as 1915, Lenin, based on a profound analysis of imperialism, came to the conclusion that the simultaneous victory of socialism in all countries is impossible; due to the uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries in the era of imperialism, socialism will definitely achieve victory first in one or several countries.
    Lenin wrote: "Unevenness of economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. From this it follows that socialism may achieve victory first in several or even in one single capitalist country." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 21, Russian edition, page 311)
    The great October Socialist Revolution confirmed the correctness of Lenin's theory. The October Revolution broke through the front line of world imperialism, overthrew its rule in a vast country—Russia—and ushered in a new era in world history—the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism. The world's first socialist country, established as a result of the victory of the October Revolution, is developing under conditions of capitalist encirclement. The existence of this encirclement has been and still is a fundamental factor determining the Soviet Union's international position.
    The Soviet state, from the very first days of its existence, has been waging a consistent struggle for peace. This stems from Lenin and Stalin's instructions on the possibility of simultaneous coexistence and peaceful economic competition between two opposing systems. Comrade Stalin pointed out in 1927: "The basis of our country's relations with capitalist countries lies in the assumption of the coexistence of two opposing systems, which has been fully confirmed by practice." (Stalin's Complete Works, Volume 10, Russian edition, page 289)
    However, although the Soviet Union, firmly believing in the inevitable victory of socialism, pursues a policy of peace, the ruling groups of the imperialist countries have pursued and continue to pursue a hostile and aggressive policy towards the Soviet Union. Immediately after the October Revolution, they organized military intervention against the young Soviet Republic, attempting to restore the old capitalist order in the Soviet Union by force. However, after suffering a devastating counterattack from the Soviet people, the imperialists never ceased their attempts to destroy the Soviet state or damage its power. In the anti-Soviet struggle, they exhausted all kinds of different means: military aggression, economic blockade, dispatching spies, organizing assassinations and saboteurs, and so on. During World War II, when the fascist bandits headed by Hitler's Germany launched a massive attack on the Soviet Union, they made a second attempt to destroy the Soviet state by force. However, all the imperialist conspiracies were completely bankrupted.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people of the Soviet Union have won a victory of world-historical significance in the struggle for communism and for the independence and prosperity of their socialist motherland.
    In the irreconcilable struggle against the enemies of Leninism, against the heinous enemies of the people, the traitors of the motherland—the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and other restorationists of capitalism—Comrade Stalin defended and comprehensively developed Lenin's theory that socialism can be victorious in one country. In arguing for Lenin's theory of the victory of socialism in one country, Stalin pointed out that the two aspects of this issue, namely the domestic aspect and the international aspect, should be distinguished.
    "The first aspect of the question of the victory of socialism in our country," Comrade Stalin wrote, "includes the question of the interrelations of the classes in our country... Can the working class of our country, in alliance with our peasantry, smash our bourgeoisie, wrest from it the land, factories, mines, etc., and build with its own forces a new, classless society, a perfectly socialist society? ...
    Leninism answers these questions in the affirmative. Lenin taught us that 'we have everything necessary to build a perfectly socialist society.'"
    Following the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, the working class and peasants of our country, united, have overcome various domestic contradictions and built a socialist society under conditions of capitalist encirclement. The possibility of the victory of socialism in a single country has become a reality in the Soviet Union; and the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin, are successfully carrying out the task of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.
    The second aspect of the question of the victory of socialism in our country, that is, the international aspect," Comrade Stalin instructed, "is the aspect of the interrelations of the Soviet Union with other countries, the aspect of external relations.
    "Under conditions when socialism has triumphed only in one country, while capitalist encirclement continues to exist, can the victory of socialism in our country be considered final, can it be considered that our country has been freed from the danger of military aggression and attempts to restore capitalism? ...
    Leninism answers these questions in the negative. Lenin taught us that 'the final victory of socialism, in the sense of a full guarantee against the restoration of bourgeois relations, is possible only on an international scale.'"
    Therefore, the question of the final victory of socialism is also the question of eliminating capitalist encirclement, because capitalist encirclement gives rise to the danger of armed intervention. Obviously, as long as the situation of capitalist encirclement exists, there will also be the danger of capitalist armed intervention. "The failure of the first armed intervention did not eliminate the danger of new armed interventions, because the source of armed interventions—that is, the situation of capitalist encirclement—continues to exist. When the situation of capitalist encirclement still exists, the failure of new armed interventions will still not eliminate the danger of armed intervention." (A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Chinese edition, page 337) In order to eliminate this danger, "it is necessary to eliminate the situation of capitalist encirclement, and to eliminate the situation of capitalist encirclement, it is necessary to achieve at least the victory of the proletarian revolution in several countries." (History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Chinese edition, page 336)
    Does the change in the Soviet Union's international position resulting from the outcome of World War II mean that the concept of capitalist encirclement is outdated, has lost its practical significance, that the danger of capitalist armed intervention and the danger of capitalist restoration attempts have been eliminated, and that our country has achieved the final victory of socialism? No! That is not what it means.
    The changes on the international stage caused by the outcome of World War II are, of course, very great. The Soviet Union defeated the vanguard of international reaction: the three fascist countries—Germany, Italy, and Japan. The defeat of the fascist countries weakened the capitalist world, enabling the people of many countries in Europe and Asia, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, to achieve new breakthroughs in the front line of world imperialism. With the emergence of the people's democratic countries, the scope of imperialist rule has been greatly reduced. The war resulted in the elimination of the so-called "cordon sanitaire" on the western border of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's enemies had originally attempted to use this to isolate our people from Europe, isolate the Soviet Union, and provoke conflicts on our borders. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic was a major event.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution, the upsurge of the colonial national liberation movement, the armed resistance against the imperialists who launched colonial wars in Malaya, Vietnam, and Burma, and the heroic struggle of the Korean people—all of these have weakened capitalism's rear in Asia. In recent years, the struggle of the people of the Near East and Africa for national independence has also been increasing. The liberation movement of the colonial people is part of the international anti-imperialist camp, it is shaking the foundations of the colonial system, thereby weakening the positions of imperialism throughout the world.
    While the capitalist system is suffering successive defeats and becoming increasingly weakened, the Soviet Union has developed and consolidated immeasurably. It has never had such well-defined and just borders. At the same time, our country has also freed itself from international isolation and become the center of a powerful international democratic camp, which unites all the people's democratic countries and has millions of active and sincere friends in capitalist countries.
    The Soviet Union is no longer the only country that has broken free from the world capitalist system. The people's countries friendly to the Soviet Union are developing and consolidating alongside the Soviet Union. The working masses of the people's democratic countries—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania—are learning from the example of the Soviet Union and, with its help, have begun the construction of socialism. The economic and cultural prosperity of these countries clearly points out to the people of European countries that only a resolute transition to socialism can guarantee the liberation of the people and the improvement of their living standards.
    There are other countries that are fighting alongside the Soviet Union for peace, democracy, and socialism. The liberation of these countries from imperialist rule has greatly strengthened the cause of socialism. This is primarily the great People's Republic of China, which is friendly to the Soviet Union. The people of the Mongolian People's Republic, Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also stand in a unified anti-imperialist camp with the Soviet Union.
    The camp of countries that have broken free from imperialist rule stretches from the Pacific coast to Central Europe, uniting eight hundred million people.
    The positions of the working class in many capitalist countries have also been strengthened. The great growth of the Communist Parties in France, Italy, and other countries, the establishment of Communist Parties in countries that did not have Communist Parties before World War II, and the establishment of mass organizations of people in various countries—trade unions, women, youth, anti-war organizations, and so on—are signs of this. Progressives in the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries are enthusiastically supporting and supporting the Soviet Union's policy of consolidating universal peace. The call of the heroic Communists of France, Italy, Australia, and other countries to never participate in anti-Soviet wars and to fully support the Soviet Union has received an increasingly broad response.
    In the years after the war, the prestige of the Soviet Union among the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries has been increasing and consolidating. The people of Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, India, and other countries who are fighting for their own independence regard the Soviet Union as a reliable friend, a friend who, at all times and in all places, firmly defends the interests of oppressed countries. Because the Soviet Union has steadfastly and consistently fought for peace, because it has defended the sovereignty of small and weak countries from the encroachment of imperialist robbers, and because it has exposed the imperialists' aggressive policies in Asia and other regions of the world, the Soviet Union has gained millions of friends in Southeast Asia, the Near East, and Africa.
    Thus, the Soviet Union's international position has undergone tremendous changes: the strength of the international socialist camp has greatly increased, and the strength of the world capitalist world has been drastically reduced and weakened. However, this change in the balance of power between the two systems does not mean that there is no longer a capitalist encirclement. It must not be forgotten that in most countries, including many major countries, power is still in the hands of capitalists. The situation of capitalist encirclement continues to exist and play a role, sending spies and traitors to countries that have broken free from the capitalist system to plot conspiracies and vainly attempt to provoke a new world war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    With the victory of the people's democratic system in many countries bordering the Soviet Union, the boundary of capitalist encirclement has retreated hundreds of kilometers from the Soviet Union's borders. Some comrades mistakenly regard the establishment of the people's democratic system in many countries adjacent to the Soviet Union as the elimination of capitalist encirclement. Obviously, these comrades regard capitalist encirclement as a purely geographical concept. This is, of course, completely incorrect.
    The current international situation clearly shows that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are not guaranteed to be free from the imperialists' attempts to launch new armed aggression against them. It is well known that in the past, whenever capitalist contradictions sharpened, the bourgeoisie turned its attention to the Soviet Union, wondering whether it could resolve a certain contradiction or all contradictions of capitalism by sacrificing the Soviet Union, the bastion of socialism (whose very existence revolutionizes the people of all countries and prevents the outbreak of new wars)?
    The ruling groups of capitalist countries, especially the ruling groups of the United States and Britain, are openly preparing a new war against peace-loving democratic countries. The entire economy of the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries is being shifted to a war footing. The U.S. government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to expand its military, train troops, and establish hundreds of naval, air force, and other military bases around the world. The U.S. and British imperialists have been rearming West Germany and Japan. They have put together an aggressive Atlantic bloc aimed at opposing the Soviet Union. They are establishing aggressive armies in Western Europe commanded by U.S. generals. The imperialists are conducting a series of colonial wars in Asia, they have invaded Korea, massacred hundreds of thousands of people, and ravaged it for more than a year. The crimes of spies and traitors exposed by Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other people's democratic countries once again remind us of the existence and rampant nature of capitalist encirclement.
    The task of every Communist, every Soviet citizen, is to raise their vigilance and strengthen the Soviet Union's defense capabilities and consolidate the Soviet state with their labor.
    Comrade Stalin wrote in his book "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics": "Under capitalist encirclement, the victory of the socialist revolution occurs only in one country, while all other countries are ruled by capitalism. At this time, the country that has won the revolution should not weaken its state, state organs, intelligence agencies, and army, but should strengthen them by all means, if this country does not want to be defeated by capitalist encirclement."
    Secondly, Comrade Stalin pointed out that this statement about the state
    "is completely correct for the period when socialism has won in one single country or in several countries."
    If the capitalist encirclement has not been replaced by socialist encirclement when the Soviet Union is building a communist society, and therefore if the danger of external armed aggression has not been eliminated, then, as Comrade Stalin taught, the Soviet state will still have to be preserved in the communist period.
    With Comrade Stalin's instructions as a compass, the Communist Party and the Soviet people are working with all their strength to consolidate the national strength of our socialist motherland. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are devoting all their energy to completing a great plan, which Comrade Stalin put forward in his speech to voters on February 9, 1946, namely: to ensure that Soviet industry can produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil every year. Comrade Stalin pointed out that "only under these conditions can it be considered that our motherland has a guarantee against any unexpected events." The completion of this plan is a great contribution to consolidating the power of our socialist motherland and the cause of peace throughout the world.
    In order to realize its great economic plans and the huge-scale construction of communism, the Soviet Union is concerned about lasting peace and broad cooperation with other countries. The strength of the Soviet Union is a guarantee of its own security and a guarantee of peace for the people of all countries.

    论资本主义的包围
    苏联乌·米赫耶夫
    编者按：苏联“布尔什维克”杂志的有些读者致函该刊编辑部，请求阐明关于资本主义包围的问题。乔治亚共和国梯比利西市读者乌沙柯夫及乌克兰共和国巧尔特柯夫市读者高夫曼问：“国际形势既已发生了根本的变化，现在可否说还有资本主义的包围？”莫斯科市读者史良金及滨海省读者莫洛佐夫两人问：“由于人民民主制度在与苏联接坏的许多国家里的胜利，因此认为资本主义包围这个概念已经失掉意义，已经不存在了，这种看法是否正确？”本文就是对上述问题的答复。
    资本主义包围是一个政治的概念。斯大林同志曾指出，不能把资本主义包围看作一个单纯的地理上的概念。斯大林同志在一九三七年联共（布）中央委员会全体会议上说过：“资本主义包围，这就是说，有一个国家即苏联，在自己国内已建立了社会主义秩序，此外还有许多国家——即资产阶级国家，它们继续进行着资本主义的生活方式，并包围着苏联，并等待时机以便进攻它、粉碎它，或者不论如何毁损它的威力，而削弱它。”
    两个对立的社会制度——社会主义制度与资本主义制度——的同时并存，是帝国主义时代社会主义革命发展的必然后果。远在一九一五年，列宁根据对帝国主义的深刻分析，就得出了一个结论说：社会主义在一切国家内同时获得胜利是不可能的；由于帝国主义时代资本主义各国经济、政治发展的不平衡，社会主义定会最初在一个或几个国家内获得胜利的。
    列宁写道：“经济的和政治的发展的不平衡性是资本主义的绝对规律。由此得出结论：社会主义可能首先在几个甚至在单独一个资本主义国家内获得胜利。”（列宁全集第二十一卷俄文版，三一一页）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命证实了列宁理论的正确。十月革命突破了世界帝国主义的战线，推翻了它在一个庞大的国家——俄国——里的统治，并揭开了世界历史的新纪元——资本主义崩溃，社会主义胜利的纪元。因十月革命的胜利而建立的世界上第一个社会主义国家是在资本主义包围的条件下发展着的。这种包围的存在，过去是现在仍然是一种决定苏联国际地位的基本因素。
    苏维埃国家，从它存在的最初几天起，就进行着争取和平的始终不渝的斗争。这是从列宁、斯大林关于两个对立制度可以同时并存和和平经济竞赛的指示出发的。斯大林同志在一九二七年指出：“我国与资本主义各国关系的基础是在于对两个对立制度并存的假定上，实践已经完全证实了它。”（斯大林全集第十卷俄文版二八九页）
    但是，坚信社会主义必然获得胜利的苏联，虽是奉行着和平政策，而帝国主义国家的统治集团却对苏联曾经、而且现在仍然实行着敌视的侵略政策。十月革命之后，他们立刻组织了对年青的苏维埃共和国的军事干涉，企图以武力在苏联恢复旧的资本主义秩序。但是，在遭到苏维埃人民的歼灭性的回击后，帝国主义者们也从未停止其消灭苏维埃国家或损伤其威力的企图。在反苏的斗争中，他们用尽了各种不同的手段：军事侵犯、经济封锁、派遣密探、组织暗害与破坏分子等等。在第二次世界大战时期，当以希特勒德国为首的法西斯匪徒大举进攻苏联时，他们第二次企图以武力消灭苏维埃国家。但是，帝国主义的一切阴谋遭到了彻头彻尾的破产。
    苏联劳动人民在共产党的领导下，在争取共产主义、争取其社会主义祖国的独立与繁荣的斗争中，已赢得了具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    斯大林同志在反对列宁主义的敌人，反对人民的凶恶敌人、祖国的叛徒——托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子以及其他资本主义复辟分子的不可调和的斗争中，捍卫了并全面地发展了列宁关于社会主义在一国内可以获得胜利的学说。在论证列宁的社会主义在一国内可以获得胜利的学说时，斯大林指出，应将这一问题的两个方面，即国内方面与国际方面加以区别。
    “关于社会主义在我国胜利问题的第一个方面——斯大林同志写道——包括我国国内各阶级相互关系的问题……我国的工人阶级能否与我国的农民联合在一起粉碎我国的资产阶级，从它的手中夺回土地、工厂、矿山等，并用自己的力量建成新的、无阶级的社会，完满的社会主义社会呢？……
    列宁主义对于这些问题的回答是肯定的。列宁教导我们说：‘我们有着建设成完满的社会主义社会的所必需的一切。’”
    遵循着列宁、斯大林的学说，我国的工人阶级和农民联合起来已经克服了国内的各种矛盾，在资本主义包围的条件下建成了社会主义社会。社会主义在单独一国内胜利的可能性已经在苏联成为现实了；而苏联人民在共产党与斯大林同志的领导下，正顺利地执行着从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的任务。
    关于社会主义在我国胜利问题的第二个方面，即国际方面，——斯大林同志指示说，——这就是苏联与其他各国相互关系的方面，对外关系的方面。
    “在社会主义——斯大林写道——仅在一个国家里胜利、而资本主义包围继续存在的条件下，能不能认为社会主义在我国的胜利就是最终的胜利，认为我国已经摆脱了军事侵犯和恢复资本主义企图的危险呢？……
    列宁主义对于这些问题的回答是否定的。列宁教导我们说：‘从免去资产阶级关系复辟的充分保障说来，社会主义的最终胜利只有在国际范围内才有可能。’”
    因此，社会主义最终胜利的问题，也就是铲除资本主义包围的问题，因为资本主义包围产生着武装干涉的危险。显然，只要资本主义包围形势存在的时候，也就会有资本主义武装干涉的危险。“第一次武装干涉的失败，并没有消灭新的武装干涉危险，因为武装干涉的来源——即资本主义的包围形势还继续存在着。在资本主义的包围形势还存在着的时候，新的武装干涉之遭受失败也还是不会使武装干涉的危险消灭的。”（联共（布）历史简明教程，中文版三三七页）为了消灭这种危险，“便必须消灭资本主义的包围形势，而要消灭资本主义的包围形势，却至少要靠无产阶级革命在几个国家内获得胜利才可做到。”（联共（布）党史，中文版，三三六页）
    由于第二次世界大战的结果所产生的苏联国际地位之变化，是不是表示资本主义包围这个概念已经陈旧了，失去了现实的意义，资本主义武装干涉的危险和资本主义复辟企图的危险已经消除，而我国已经达到了社会主义的最终胜利呢？不！不是这个意思。
    第二次世界大战的结果所引起的国际舞台上的变化，当然，是非常巨大的。苏联击溃了国际反动派的先头部队：三个法西斯国家——德国、意大利及日本。法西斯国家之被击溃削弱了资本主义世界，使欧亚两洲许多国家的人民，依靠苏联的援助，实现了对世界帝国主义阵线之新的突破，随着各人民民主国家的发生，帝国主义统治的范围大大地缩小了。战争的结果是消灭了苏联西境的所谓的“防疫带”。苏联的敌人本来企图借此把我国人民与欧洲隔离开来，孤立苏联，并在我国边境上挑起冲突。德意志民主共和国的成立乃是一个重大的事件。
    中国革命的胜利，殖民地民族解放运动的高涨，对于那在马来亚、越南及缅甸等地发动殖民地战争的帝国主义者们的武装反击，朝鲜人民的英勇斗争——所有这一切都削弱了资本主义在亚洲的后方。近几年来，近东与非洲各国人民争取民族独立的斗争也正在增强着。殖民地人民的解放运动乃是国际反帝国主义阵营的一部分，它摇撼着殖民地制度的基础，从而削弱着帝国主义在全世界的阵地。
    当资本主义制度接连遭受失败而越来越削弱的时候，苏联却无可计量地发展与巩固了。它从来不曾有过这样良好而公正划定的疆界。同时我国也摆脱了国际上的孤立地位，而成为强大的国际民主阵营的中心，它团结了一切人民民主国家，并且在资本主义国家里拥有千百万积极真挚的友人。
    苏联现在已不是挣脱世界资本主义制度的唯一国家了。与苏联友好的各人民国家正在与苏联并肩发展与巩固着。各人民民主国家——波兰、捷克斯拉夫、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚的劳动群众，学习苏联的榜样，并依靠它的帮助，已经开始了社会主义的建设。这些国家里的经济、文化的繁荣，明白地向欧洲各国人民指出：只有坚决地过渡到社会主义才能保证各国人民的解放及其生活水平的提高。
    与苏联并肩为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争的，还有其他国家。这些国家的摆脱帝国主义统治，大大地加强了社会主义事业。这首先是与苏联友好的伟大的中华人民共和国。蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜、越南民主共和国的人民也与苏联一道站在统一的反帝国主义阵营中。
    摆脱了帝国主义统治的国家阵营，从太平洋沿岸伸展到欧洲中部，团结了八亿人口。
    许多资本主义国家中的工人阶级之阵地也增强了。法国、意大利及其他国家中的共产党的巨大成长，那些在第二次世界大战以前还没有共产党的国家中的共产党的成立，各国人民群众组织——工会、妇女、青年，反战等组织的成立，便是这种标志。美国、英国及其他资本主义国家的进步人士们都在热烈地赞助和支持苏联巩固普遍和平的政策。法国、意大利、澳大利亚及其他国家的英勇的共产党人底决不参加反苏战争和全力支持苏联的号召已经得到日益扩大的响应了。
    战后数年来，苏联在殖民地半殖民地各国人民中间的威信日益提高与巩固起来了。为自身独立而斗争的印尼、越南、缅甸、菲律宾、马来亚、印度等国的人民把苏联看作足以信赖的朋友，这个朋友无论在何时何地都是坚决不渝地维护被压迫国家的利益的。由于苏联坚定而一贯地为和平而斗争，由于它保卫弱小国家的主权以免帝国主义强盗的侵害，由于它揭穿了帝国主义者在亚洲以及世界上其他地域的侵略政策，所以苏联获得了东南亚、近东、菲洲各国千百万朋友。
    这样，苏联的国际地位就发生了巨大的变化：社会主义国际阵营的力量大为壮大，世界资本主义世界的力量剧烈缩小和削弱了。但是，两种制度底力量对比之这种变化，决不意味着目前不再有资本主义的包围了。不能忘记：在大多数国家里，包括许多大国在内，其政权依然是掌握在资本家的手里。资本主义的包围形势继续存在和起着作用，它派遣间谍与奸细潜入已摆脱了资本主义制度的国家去策划阴谋，并妄想挑起新的世界大战来反对苏联及各人民民主国家。
    随着与苏联接壤的许多国家里的人民民主制度底胜利，资本主义包围的界线已由苏联的边界后退了数百公里。某些同志将与苏联毗连的许多国家中人民民主制度的建立，误认为资本主义包围的消灭。显然，这些同志把资本主义包围看作纯粹地理上的概念。这当然是完全不正确的。
    目前的国际局势特别明显地表明，苏联及各人民民主国家并没有保证免去帝国主义者对他们发动新的武装侵略的企图。众所周知，以前每当资本主义矛盾尖锐化的时候，资产阶级就把视线转到苏联，看能不能牺牲苏联这个社会主义的堡垒（它存在本身便使各国人民革命化，并妨碍新战争的爆发）来解决资本主义的某一矛盾或全部矛盾？
    资本主义国家的统治集团，首先是美英两国的统治集团，明目张胆地准备新的战争来反对爱好和平的民主国家。美国、英国以及其他资本主义国家的全部经济正在转上战争的轨道。美国政府把数百亿美元用于扩充军备，训练军队，并在世界各地建立数百个海、空军及其他军事基地。美英帝国主义者们已在重新武装西德与日本。他们凑合了以反对苏联为目的的侵略性的大西洋集团。他们正在建立以美国将军们为指挥的西欧的侵略军队，帝国主义者们在亚洲进行着一系列的殖民地战争，它们侵入朝鲜，屠杀了数十万人民，并蹂躏它已经一年多了。捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利、保加利亚及其他人民民主国家所揭穿的间谍与奸细的罪行，都再一次地提醒我们资本主义包围形势的存在及其猖狂性。
    每个共产党人，每个苏联公民的任务，就是提高自己的警惕性，并以自己的劳动去加强苏联的国防力量，巩固苏维埃国家。
    斯大林同志在其“马克思主义与语言学问题”一著作中写道：“在资本主义包围之下，社会主义革命底胜利只发生在一个国家内，而所有其他国家则为资本主义所统治，这时候，革命胜利了的国家不应当削弱自己的国家、国家机关、侦察机关、军队，而应当用一切办法加强它们，如果这个国家不愿意被资本主义的包围所击溃的话。”
    其次，斯大林同志指出，关于国家的这个说法
    “对于社会主义在单独一个国家内或在几个国家内获得胜利的时期”是完全正确的。
    如果当苏联将建立起共产主义社会的时候，资本主义包围形势还没有代以社会主义包围的话，因而如果外来的武装侵犯的危险还没有消灭的话，那末，正如斯大林同志所教导的，在共产主义时期，苏维埃国家仍要保存着。
    共产党与苏联人民以斯大林同志的指示为南针，正以全力巩固我们社会主义祖国的国力。苏联人民在共产党的领导下，正在献出自己的全部精力来完成一个伟大的计划，这个计划是斯大林同志于一九四六年二月九日在对选民的演说中所提出的，就是：做到使苏联工业每年能生产五千万吨生铁，六千万吨钢，五万万吨煤，六千万吨石油。斯大林同志指出说：“只有在这种条件之下，才能认为我们的祖国有了免去任何意外事件的保证。”这个计划的完成是巩固我们社会主义祖国威力及全世界和平事业的一种伟大贡献。
    为了实现其伟大的经济计划与共产主义的巨大规模的建设，苏联是关心持久和平以及与其他国家的广泛合作的。苏联的强盛——乃是其自身安全的保证，也是世界各国人民和平的保证。
