    Northeast People's Government Ministry of Finance and its Six Subordinate Bureaus
    Launch Mass Movement Against Corruption and Waste
    Great results have been achieved: strict financial system, strengthened public awareness of protecting state property, improved leadership, and greatly increased work efficiency.
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Finance of the Northeast People's Government and its six subordinate bureaus, in the movement against corruption, degeneration, extravagance, and bureaucracy, fully developed democracy, mobilized the masses to conduct extensive inspections, and thus greatly improved leadership, increased work efficiency, and educated cadres and the masses. This movement was divided into three stages. In the first stage, the ministry's leadership pointed out six key areas for inspection: corruption and bribery, stealing from the public to benefit small units, dereliction of duty, using work convenience to steal personal gains, extravagance and violation of regulations, and detachment from the masses. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to offer opinions to leaders at all levels, and seven inspection teams were organized by the Party's general branch committee, the cadre department, the secretariat, the inspection department, and the accounting office of the Ministry of Finance to go to various bureaus for inspection, combining top-down inspection with bottom-up mass mobilization. Due to the full development and protection of democracy, this stage basically achieved the goal of allowing the masses to "know everything and say everything," exposing many major problems. Regarding violations of financial discipline, for example, the Tax Bureau did not hand over 9.5 billion yuan of fines to the state treasury but deposited it in the bank privately, earning more than 700 million yuan in interest (old Northeast currency) as the agency's income; the Grain Bureau used materials left over from building warehouses to build air-raid shelters and then reimbursed 600 million yuan (old Northeast currency) from the public to increase the agency's "small private savings"; the Salt Bureau used public funds to engage in trading, etc. Regarding accidents caused by dereliction of duty, for example, the Military Expenditure Bureau constructed a warehouse in a certain city, which resulted in rework and a loss of more than 10 million yuan in Renminbi due to poor planning; the glycerine of the Materials Bureau deteriorated due to poor transportation and storage, requiring an additional 1.4 billion yuan in processing fees. The most prominent example of extravagance and waste was the Materials Bureau. The leading cadres of the Materials Bureau disliked the old sofas, iron beds, and other furniture and wanted to replace them all with new ones, wasting more than 200 million yuan. Some units had more than 100 million yuan in "small private savings," so they violated the rules and regulations, arbitrarily spending money, and the phenomenon of unreasonable "subsidies" was very serious.
    In the second stage of the movement, reporting, confession, and exposure were carried out more widely and deeply, with a realistic attitude, distinguishing right from wrong, talking about facts while criticizing ideas, in order to achieve consensus and improve everyone's understanding ideologically. After these two stages, many problems were exposed in terms of systems and cadres' thinking, the masses' understanding was greatly improved, and many new atmospheres appeared in the agencies. On this basis, the movement entered the third stage. Units engaged in production planned and launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, making specific plans to increase production and practice economy. In the agencies, methods were proposed to improve internal affairs and strengthen external affairs. For example, the ministry and its subordinate bureaus transferred more than 300 cadres to the business systems to conduct inspection work in four areas: basic construction, public grain, taxation, and financial discipline, and proposed to go deeper at each level, face the site, grasp the key, and discover and solve problems. The staff remaining in the agencies were required to improve work efficiency and handle daily work.
    The harvest of this movement is huge. (1) The financial system has been strictly enforced, and the masses' awareness of protecting state wealth has been strengthened. All bureaus have now inventoried and handed over all "small private savings" to the public, and all extra subsidies that do not comply with the system have been stopped. Due to the conscientious implementation of the system, agency expenditures have been drastically reduced. In the past, the Military Expenditure Bureau's office expenses and water and electricity bills exceeded the standard by three times, but now they are gradually approaching the standard. Gasoline consumption in all bureaus has also generally decreased. In the past, the Ministry of Finance's gasoline consumption exceeded the standard by two large barrels (more than 700 pounds) per month. Since September, no subsidies have been needed, and there is still a surplus. The travel expenses of the Monopoly Bureau have never been seriously implemented according to the system, and disputes often arose when reporting accounts. Now that the implementation is serious, the cadres have no opinions, and the comrades who do general affairs and accounting work generally say that the work is now easier to do. This movement has improved the masses' ideological awareness, making them deeply feel that the state's wealth is the fruit of the people's labor, and wasting the state's wealth is an intolerable phenomenon, so we must be careful in every possible way and practice strict economy. (2) Cadres' sense of responsibility has been strengthened, and work efficiency has been improved. This is reflected in the reduction of unnecessary official correspondence and form filling in the agencies, the shortening of meeting times, and everyone is actively studying and improving work methods to improve efficiency. This time, the Ministry of Finance and its subordinate bureaus generally transferred one-third or even one-half of their staff to inspect work, and the original work tasks were not affected. Units that used to complain about not having enough cadres were able to transfer cadres to inspect work because of improved work efficiency. In a certain section of the Monopoly Bureau, 16 of the 24 cadres went down to inspect work, and the remaining eight people did the work of 24 people. In the past, the audit of treasury receipts in the accounting section of the Tax Bureau was so busy that ten people did not have time to participate in study and often worked overtime, which was tiring and troublesome, and no one was willing to do it; after simplifying the procedures, it was changed to a subject audit form, and five people could complete it without working overtime. (3) Improved leadership at all levels, strengthened unity, and enhanced the political atmosphere in the agencies. In the past, the leadership believed that there were not many problems in their departments, but as a result, many problems were discovered. Therefore, the leadership's vigilance has been improved, and they are more humble in considering issues. The relationship between cadres has also improved.
    Because the Party branch has always played a strong core role in the movement, its prestige among the masses has been greatly improved. Staff members have successively formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy and sent them to the general branch committee, and they are prepared to incorporate them into the patriotic pact.

    东北人民政府财政部及所属六个局
    发动群众反对贪污浪费
    现已取得极大的收获：严格了财政制度，加强了群众爱护国家财产的观点，改进了领导，大大提高了工作效率。
    【本报讯】东北人民政府财政部及其所属六个局，在反对贪污蜕化、反对铺张浪费、反对官僚主义运动中，充分发扬了民主，发动群众进行了广泛的检查，因而大大地改进了领导，提高了工作效率，教育了干部和群众。这一运动共分三个阶段。在第一阶段，该部领导上指出了着重检查的六个方面：贪污受贿，盗大公家肥小单位，工作失职，利用工作方便、窃取肥私，铺张浪费、违反制度，脱离群众。同时发动群众向各级领导提意见并由财政部党的总支委员会、干部处、秘书处、检查处、会计室等单位组织了七个检查小组分赴各局检查；使自上而下的检查与自下而上的发动群众相结合。由于充分发扬民主、保障民主，这一阶段基本上作到了使群众“知无不言，言无不尽”，暴露了许多重大问题。在违反财政纪律方面，如税务局将罚款九十五亿元不交国库，私自存入银行，得利息七亿余元（原东北币）算做机关收入；粮食局将以前修仓库剩下的材料修防空洞，又向公家报销了六亿元（原东北币），以增加机关的“小家底”；盐务局拿公款做买卖等。属于因工作失职而发生责任事故方面的，如军费局在某市修建仓库，因计划不周，造成返工，损失人民币一千余万元；物资局的甘油，因运输、保管不好而变质，需多用加工费十四亿元。在铺张浪费方面最突出的要算物资局。物资局领导干部嫌旧有沙发、铁床等家具不漂亮，要全部换新的。浪费二亿余元。有的单位有一亿余元的“小家底”，所以违反制度，擅自开支，不合理的“补助”等现象很严重。
    在运动的第二阶段，更广泛更深入地开展了检举、坦白、揭发，以实事求是的态度，分清是非，一面谈事实，一面批判思想，以求大家取得一致认识，从思想上提高一步。经过这两个阶段，在制度、干部思想等方面都暴露了不少问题，群众认识大为提高，机关里出现了许多新气象。在此基础上，转入了第三阶段。从事生产的单位有计划地开展增产节约运动，作出增产节约的具体计划。在机关里并提出提高内勤、加强外勤的办法。如该部及所属各局共抽调三百余名干部到各业务系统去作基本建设、公粮、税收、财政纪律等四个方面的检查工作，并提出要层层深入、面向现场、抓住关键、发现与解决问题。机关内部剩下的工作人员则须提高工作效率，处理日常工作。
    这一运动的收获是巨大的。（一）严格了财政制度，加强了群众爱护国家财富的观点。各局现在把“小家底”一律清点交公，一切不合制度的额外补助也已停止。由于认真执行了制度，机关开支骤减。军费局过去办公杂支，水电费超过标准三倍，现在已逐渐接近标准。各局汽油消耗也普遍减少，财政部过去汽油消耗每月超支二大桶（七百多斤），九月份以来，不需补助，尚有结余。专卖局的出差旅费，从未认真按制度执行，报账时就常引起争执，现在执行认真了，干部没有意见，做总务和会计工作的同志也普遍地说现在的工作好做了。这一运动提高了群众思想觉悟，使群众深切感到国家财富是人民的劳动果实，浪费国家财富是不能容忍的现象，因此必须处处精打细算，厉行节约。（二）干部责任心加强，工作效率提高。表现在机关中不必要的公文往来、表格填造减少，开会时间缩短，每个人都在积极钻研改进工作方法，提高效率。这次财政部及其所属各局普遍抽出三分之一甚至二分之一的人员下去检查工作，原有的工作任务并未受影响。过去嚷干部不够用的单位，因为提高了工作效率，也同样能抽调干部下去检查工作。专卖局某处廿四个干部中有十六人下去检查工作，余下八个人做了廿四人的工作。过去，税务局会计处的审核库据票，十个人忙得无时间参加学习，还常常加夜班，又累又麻烦，谁也不乐意做；经过简化手续后，改为科目审核表，五个人不加夜班就能做完。（三）改进了各级领导，加强了团结，机关政治空气增强。过去领导上认为本部门没有多大问题的，结果都发现了不少问题。因此提高了领导的警惕性，考虑问题更加虚心。干部之间的关系也有所改进。
    由于党支部在运动中始终起着坚强的核心作用，因此在群众中威信大为提高，工作人员纷纷订出增产节约具体计划送到总支委员会，并准备订到爱国公约中去。
