The purpose of asset clearance in cooperatives is to understand the assets, determine property rights, and ensure consistency between accounts and reality, in order to grasp the basic financial situation of the cooperatives and lay the foundation for economic accounting. In the old liberated areas, cooperatives in many regions were destroyed several times by the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, and we rebuilt them several times, resulting in significant changes in assets. In the newly liberated areas, cooperatives were also involved in many enemy and puppet property issues. In addition, cooperatives in both old and new areas developed rapidly, with few personnel and low business skills, and unsound accounting systems, making the sources and uses of various funds, as well as the ownership of houses, equipment, and appliances, unclear.

Since the end of 1950, cooperatives at all levels across the country have been carrying out asset clearance work. Under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, it was stipulated that the contents of the clearance should include five items: clearing of various funds, various properties, bad debts and arrears, stockpiled goods, and man-made losses. The focus of the clearance was first placed on federations at the county level and above. After gaining experience, the county (city) cooperatives formulated plans to lead the clearance of grassroots cooperatives. In the first quarter of this year, all major administrative regions except the Southwest region launched this work.

    Inspection and Preliminary Improvement of Stagnant and
    Wasteful Use of Funds

So far, approximately 1,500 county-level and higher-level cooperatives across the country have launched asset clearance work. Some have been completed, and some are still in progress. According to the materials estimated from 567 units that have already been received, county-level and higher-level cooperatives currently have nearly 100 billion yuan in stagnant and wasteful funds. The serious phenomenon of this stagnant and wasteful use of funds has been inspected and initially improved during the asset clearance.

First, there is the problem of handling seriously stockpiled goods, damaged goods, and idle packaging materials. According to statistics, among the 567 county-level and higher-level cooperatives that have been cleared, 305 have slow-moving goods stockpiled for more than six months, with 26 billion yuan in stockpiled funds, and it is estimated that all cooperatives across the country have a total stockpile of approximately 70 billion yuan. 128 units have damaged goods, with 470 million yuan in stockpiled funds, and it is estimated that all cooperatives across the country have a total stockpile of approximately 2 billion yuan. 242 units have idle packaging materials, with 3.4 billion yuan in stockpiled funds, and it is estimated that all cooperatives across the country have a total stockpile of approximately 14 billion yuan. These three types of stockpiles have resulted in a total stagnation of 86 billion yuan in funds, with an average of approximately 103 million yuan in stockpiled funds per cooperative. The situation in some regions is particularly serious, such as the Sui'an County Cooperative in Zhejiang, where the total state allocation of funds and other allocated funds is only over 160 million yuan, but the stockpile of goods is as high as over 420 million yuan. The Jiyuan County Cooperative in Pingyuan has a stockpile of goods of over 200 million yuan, equivalent to eight and a half times the state allocation of funds to it. The reasons for the occurrence of slow-moving goods are mainly that purchases are not planned and do not meet the needs of local cooperative members; or that the conservative idea of being reluctant to sell is at play, and the sales season for popular goods is missed; and secondly, that inventories are not taken on a regular basis to grasp the inventory situation. After the asset clearance of slow-moving goods, damaged goods, and idle packaging materials, leaders and general staff at all levels of cooperatives have paid attention to solving the problem of stockpiled funds. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Cooperative had a stockpile of over 1 billion yuan before the clearance, which was reduced to 140 million yuan after the clearance. The Cangxian Prefectural Cooperative in Hebei Province significantly improved its commodity turnover rate because it quickly sold slow-moving goods during the clearance.

Secondly, there is the clearing of accounts receivable and bad debts. Taking the Hebei Provincial Cooperative as an example: before the clearance, the provincial cooperative owed 42.6 billion yuan externally, and 65 percent was recovered after the clearance; the 61 county cooperatives in Hebei Province originally owed 9 billion yuan externally, and 3.4 billion yuan was recovered after the clearance; another 4.9 billion yuan was in arrears, and the cooperative has signed a clearance agreement with the debtors; bad debts have been reduced to over 450 million yuan. According to the materials received, 118 units have bad debts. It is estimated that the country has at least 2.4 billion yuan in bad debts. The reasons for the occurrence of bad debts are mainly that the responsibilities of cadres are unclear, and there is no guarantee of a certain procedural system.

Thirdly, there is the exposure of corruption, waste, and dereliction of duty. In the reports received, 186 units exposed corruption, waste, and dereliction of duty, with a loss of 2 billion yuan. It is estimated that the losses caused by corruption and dereliction of duty across the country are approximately 8.3 billion yuan. Among them, cooperatives in Zhejiang Province lost a total of 500 million yuan due to theft, water damage, and corruption. According to incomplete statistics from the Pingyuan Provincial Cooperative and various prefectural, municipal, and county cooperatives, losses due to corruption, loss of funds, shortage of goods, spoilage, fire, theft, abduction, and fines amounted to 930 million yuan. Liang Chunyi and other seven people from the Beijing Municipal Cooperative embezzled over 15 million yuan of public funds. The Dahe Village Cooperative in Dehui County, Jilin, had a total capital of 160 million yuan, and the cadres borrowed over 100 million yuan. The directors and supervisors of the Liubeidian Village Cooperative in Daming County, Hebei, ate and drank extravagantly, wasting more than 2 million yuan. There are many other similar examples. Checking corruption and dereliction of duty and severely punishing the personnel involved is of great educational significance to cadres and the masses. After asset clearance, the Chahar Provincial Cooperative mobilized cooperatives at all levels to carry out property safety competitions. There were 195 loss incidents in the province in 1950, but only 49 incidents so far this year.

In addition, cooperatives in various regions have also focused on rectifying assets and determining property rights. Key rectification of state allocations of funds, local allocations, and off-book funds, totaling over 560 billion yuan. Since 1949, the national treasury has allocated a total of 333.57 million jin of millet to cooperatives several times, distributing it to 650 units of cooperatives at all levels in North China, East China, Central South, and Northwest China. The changes in price calculation in real terms, the confusion of physical objects and amounts, hindered the correct grasp and use of this fund. In this clearance, after repeated reconciliation and exchange of receipts, a total amount of 311.5 billion yuan has been cleared, clarifying the situation of this fund. There were cases of unclear sources of funds and incorrect bookkeeping of local allocations to cooperatives. During the clearance, 116 units were found, with an adjusted amount of 64.1 billion yuan; it is estimated that the country has approximately 174 billion yuan. There were 334 units that discovered off-book assets or asset valuations that were inaccurate, as well as other reasons for increased income, with a total increase in special reserve funds of 30.4 billion yuan; it is estimated that the country can increase approximately 80 billion yuan. This played the role of key rectification of assets, not only making names and realities consistent but also eliminating off-book funds. At the same time, the ownership, lease rights, and entrusted management rights of assets were extremely chaotic in the past; after the clearance, the procedures were completed and the property rights were determined.

After the clearance, the guiding ideology of the economic accounting system of cooperatives at all levels has been generally improved, and they are more familiar with the financial situation than before. At the same time, the connection between various departments of cooperatives at all levels has also been strengthened. In the past, the accounting department only took care of bookkeeping and did not pay attention to reflecting the situation; the administrative department only took care of purchasing and ignored budgeting and storage; the business department only took care of signing contracts, purchasing goods, and selling goods, and sometimes goods were sold on credit without reporting to the accounting department for bookkeeping. Some units have formulated some systems and measures after the clearance. For the safety of warehouses, the cooperatives in Beijing have formulated a system of division of responsibility for inspection; to facilitate inventory, they have formulated a system of storage location for inventory. Zhejiang has formulated measures for the purchase, acceptance, insurance, and cancellation of fixed assets, as well as measures for the management of the purchase and sale of goods. Liaoxi has formulated handover procedures and budget systems. The Zhaowuda League of Inner Mongolia has formulated various inspection systems. Jilin has formulated measures for the management of spare parts, the handling of credit and slow-moving goods. The establishment of these systems has a great effect on doing a good job in property management.

        Several Issues to be Resolved

Although the asset clearance work of cooperatives has initially achieved some success, there are still some issues that need to be resolved at the same time.

First, some units lack organization and planning in asset clearance work. The complexity of the clearance work on a national scale should not be underestimated. Therefore, the unified methods of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives can only be general and principled; when specifically applied to various regions, it mainly relies on the cooperatives in various regions to formulate specific plans based on the spirit of the unified methods and combined with the specific local conditions. Except for provinces such as Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jilin, and Rehe, which basically did this, some regions do not have enough planning in this work. For example, the Central South and Northeast regions originally deployed early and carried out experiments with emphasis to absorb experience. For example, the asset clearance of cooperatives in Huanggang County in Hubei and Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi cities in the Northeast was carried out very early, but it slowed down in the second quarter, and it was not until the third quarter that it was decided to implement it from the beginning, which made the work take a detour.

Second, some leading cadres and some staff of the cooperatives still have many incorrect understandings of the clearance work, which need to be corrected. After the start of the clearance, some units' staff were afraid of trouble, thinking it was a "fuss about nothing," or had a paralyzing idea, thinking there was "nothing to clear," thus generating a purely task-oriented view. The Binhai County Cooperative in northern Jiangsu declared "clearance completed" after only two days of clearance; later, they felt there was a problem, so they cleared it again. Individual units were afraid of checking accounts because individual cadres lived a corrupt life and their accounts were unclear. Some leading cadres in Hebei Province emphasized "busy work" and opposed asset clearance to other work; or they simply arranged it without paying attention to organization and inspection, or even failing to improve the clearance organization work of their own units. Like Tangshan Prefecture, the Clearance Committee was not established in accordance with regulations until the Provincial Cooperative came to inspect; Cangxian Prefecture had not started the deployment until February, except for Xianxian County. Because some units lack organizational planning and inspection systems in their specific work, there is a phenomenon of "loose first and then tight," "hot and cold," "piecemeal," or simply assigning accounting staff to clear.

Third, some areas have few cooperative cadres and insufficient technology, coupled with a lack of archives or poor management, which hinders the progress of the clearance work. For example, the Xi'an Municipal Cooperative has only three financial accounting cadres; they are trapped in daily accounting work, so it is difficult to carry out asset clearance work. The Yuxiang County Cooperative in Shanxi Province lacked financial accounting cadres, and there were no accounts established for five months after opening, making the clearance work without a basis, so the asset clearance work was made a simple "inventory work."

What to Do in the Future

The nationwide asset clearance work of cooperatives at all levels carried out in 1951 is only the beginning of this work. All levels of cooperatives that have undergone this clearance should further improve the work of asset clearance. Units that have not carried out the clearance should make up for the surprise clearance and accelerate the process.

In the 1952 asset clearance work, it should be closely combined with the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, so that cooperative cadres generally realize that responding to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers" is an unshirkable political task for every cooperative worker. Doing a good job in asset clearance is one of the specific actions to respond to this call. The cooperative leading organizations in various regions should formulate clearance methods suitable for their respective regions, and effectively grasp, lead, promote, and inspect. The focus of work should be placed on grassroots cooperatives and county (city) cooperatives.

In the future progress of this work, it is necessary to correct the erroneous thinking of some cadres, the first is to overcome the supply system thinking of cadres in management. For example, failure to report accounts after completing tasks, failure to pay attention to the safekeeping of assets, failure to calculate accounts in detail, thinking that "meat is rotten in the pot," and clearing or not clearing is the same. This kind of thinking is a major obstacle to the development of cooperatives and must be resolutely eliminated. At the same time, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate the corrupt thinking of some cadres in the cooperatives and severely punish corruption and dereliction of duty.

Finally, in order to consolidate the results of the clearance work, cooperatives at all levels should quickly formulate various systems applicable to their departments to ensure that loopholes in various work are blocked and work efficiency is improved.

    全国各地合作社的清理资产工作
       黄肇兴
    合作社清理资产的目的是了解家当、确定产权和促使账实相符，以便掌握合作社基本财务情况，为经济核算制打下基础。老解放区许多地区的合作社在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争中经过敌人几度破坏，我们又几次把它们恢复起来，资产变动很大；新解放区合作社又牵连到许多敌伪财产问题，加以老区新区合作社发展都很快，人员少，业务水平低，会计制度不健全，使合作社各项资金的来源和用途，以及房屋、设备、器具等的所有权等都紊乱不清。
    全国各地各级合作社自一九五○年底开始进行清理资产工作。在全国合作社联合总社领导下，规定清理的内容为清理各项资金、各项财产、呆账和拖欠、积压货品、人为损失等五项。清理的重点先放在县以上各级联合社。取得经验后，再由县（市）社拟定计划领导基层社清理。今年第一季度，除西南以外各大行政区都展开了这个工作。
    检查并初步改善了呆滞和
    浪费资金的现象
    到目前为止，全国县级以上各级合作社，大体上已经发动了清理资产工作的约有一千五百个单位。有的已完成，有的还在继续进行。根据已经收到的五百六十七个单位的材料估计，县级以上合作社现在呆滞和浪费资金近一千亿元。在清理资产中检查并初步改善了这种呆滞和浪费资金的严重现象。
    首先是处理严重的积压货品、残坏货品和闲置的包装用品的问题。据统计，已经进行清理的五百六十七个县级以上的合作社，积压冷背货品达半年以上的有三百零五个，积压资金二百六十亿元，估计全国各合作社总共积压约七百亿元；一百二十八个单位有残坏货品，积压资金四亿七千万元，估计全国各合作社总共积压约二十亿元；闲置包装用品的有二百四十二个单位，积压资金三十四亿元，估计全国各合作社总共积压约一百四十亿元。这三种积压共计呆滞了资金八百六十亿元，平均每一社约积压资金一亿零三百万元。其中有的地区积压的情况尤其严重，如浙江遂安县社，国家拨付基金及其他拨入资金合计仅一亿六千多万元，积压货品竟有四亿二千多万元。平原济源县社积压货品二亿多元，相当于国家拨付给它的基金的八倍半。冷背货品发生的原因，主要是进货没计划，不切合当地社员需要；或者是保守惜卖思想作怪，把畅销货错过销售季节；其次是没有按期盘点，掌握库存情况。各级合作社经过清理冷背货品、残坏货品和闲置的包装用品，引起了领导干部和一般工作人员对解决积压资金问题的重视。像上海市社清理前积压货品十亿多元，清理后减到一亿四千万元。河北沧县专区社因为在清理中迅速推销了冷背货，商品周转率显著提高。
    其次是清理了账款和呆账。以河北省社为例：清理前省社外欠四百二十六亿元，清理后收回百分之六十五；河北省六十一个县社，原有外欠九十亿元，清理后收回三十四亿元；另有四十九亿元的拖欠，合作社已和欠款者订出了清理协议；呆账减少到四亿五千多万元。据已收到的材料，一百一十八个单位有呆账。估计全国至少有呆账二十四亿元。呆账发生的原因主要是干部责任不明，没有一定的手续制度保证。
    再次是揭发了贪污、浪费和失职事件。在已收到的报告中，揭发贪污、浪费和失职的，有一百八十六个单位，损失金额二十亿元。估计全国由贪污失职所造成的损失约八十三亿元。其中像浙江省各合作社因偷盗、水渍、贪污等共损失五亿元。据平原省社及各专区、市、县社的不完全统计，因贪污、丢款、短货、霉烂、失火、偷盗、被拐、被罚等损失九亿三千万元。北京市社梁纯义等七个人就贪污公款一千五百多万元。吉林德惠县大和村社总资金一亿六千万元，干部赊借竟达一亿元以上。河北大名县刘北店村合作社理事监事大吃大喝，计算起来浪费二百多万元。其它类似上述的例子还有很多。检查贪污失职，并对有关人员严加处理，对干部和群众的教育意义很大。察哈尔省合作社在清理资产后，接着动员各级合作社开展财产安全竞赛，全省损失事件在一九五○年有一百九十五起，今年到目前为止只有四十九起。
    此外，各地合作社还有重点地整顿了资产，确定了产权。有重点地整顿国家拨付基金、地方拨付款项、和账外款项等，共计五千六百多亿元。一九四九年以来，由国库几次拨付合作社的基金共计三亿三千三百五十七万斤小米，分配给华北、华东、中南、西北各级合作社六百五十个单位。折实计价的变动，实物和金额混乱，妨碍了正确地掌握和运用这项资金。在这一次清理中，经过反复对账和换据工作，已经清出总金额三千一百一十五亿元，澄清了这项资金的情况。地方对合作社拨款有来源不清和下账错误的情形的，清理中发现有一百一十六个单位，调整金额六百四十一亿元；估计全国大约有一千七百四十亿元。账外发现资产或资产估价不实以及由于其他原因增溢收入的有三百三十四个单位，共计增加特别公积金三百零四亿元；估计全国可增加大约八百亿元。这样就起了重点整顿资产的作用，不仅使名实相符，并且杜绝了账外款项。同时资产的所有权、租赁权、代管权等，过去极为混乱；经清理完备了手续，确定了产权。
    经过清理，各级合作社经济核算制的领导思想普遍提高，对财务情况较前熟悉，同时各级合作社各部门间的联系也加强了。过去会计部门只管下账，不注意反映情况；事务部门只管购置，忽略预算和保管；业务部门只管签订合同，进货，销货，有时货品赊出不报告给会计记账。有些单位清理后订出
    一些制度和办法。北京市各合作社为了仓库安全，制订了分责检查制；为了便于盘点，制订了存货囤位制。浙江制订了固定资产购买、点收、保险、注销办法及货品进销管理办法。辽西制订交接手续及预算制度。内蒙昭乌达盟制订了各项检查制度。吉林制订了备品管理、处理赊欠及冷背货等办法。这些制度的创设，对作好财产保管工作是有很大作用的。
        有待解决的几个问题
    合作社的清理资产工作虽然初步得到若干成就，但是同时还有一些问题须要解决。
    第一、若干单位在清理资产工作中缺乏组织性和计划性。全国范围的清理工作，它的复杂性自然不容低估。因此，全国合作总社统一的办法只能是一般原则性的；具体适用到各个地区时，主要靠各个地区合作社根据统一办法的精神，结合当地具体情况制定具体计划。除了河北、平原、山东、浙江、吉林、热河等省份基本上这样做了以外，有些地区在这件工作上的计划性是不够的。例如：中南、东北等区原先都很早布置并有重点地进行试验，吸取经验。像湖北的黄冈县，东北的鞍山、抚顺、本溪等市合作社清理资产都进行得很早，但到了第二季度就表现迟缓，直到第三季度才决定从头贯彻，使工作走了弯路。
    第二、合作社的个别领导干部和部分工作人员对清理工作还有许多不正确的认识，有待纠正。在清理开始后，有些单位的工作人员怕麻烦，认为“小题大做”，或者有麻痹思想，认为“没啥可清的”，因此产生了单纯任务观点。苏北滨海县社只清理了两天，就宣告“清理完毕”；后来又感到有问题，于是重新清理。个别单位因为个别干部生活腐化，账目不清，就怕查账。河北省部分领导干部强调“工作忙”，把清理资产和其他工作对立起来；或者仅仅布置一下，而没有注意到组织和检查，甚至连本单位的清理组织工作都没健全起来。像唐山专区，直到省社来检查后才按规定成立清理委员会；沧县专区，除献县外，一直迟到二月份还没开始布置。因为若干单位在具体工作中缺乏组织计划、检查制度，就发生“先松后紧”、“忽冷忽热”、“零打碎敲”或仅单纯责成会计人员去清理的现象。
    第三、部分地区合作社干部少，技术不足，再加档案缺乏或管理不善，妨碍了清理工作的进行。如西安市社财务会计干部只有三个人；他们陷于日常账务工作，就很难进行资产清理工作。山西虞乡县社因为缺少财务会计干部，开业后足有五个月没有立账，使清理工作没有可依据的，于是把清理资产工作做成单纯的“清点工作”。
    今后怎样做
    一九五一年所进行的全国范围的各级合作社清理资产工作，只是这个工作的开端。各级合作社凡已经过这次清理的，就应该把清理资产的工作再提高
    一步。没有进行清理的单位，应该补行突击清理，加速进行。
    在一九五二年清理资产工作和开展增产节约运动要密切结合起来，使合作社干部普遍认识到：响应毛主席的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，是每个合作社工作者义不容辞的政治任务。做好清理资产工作，就是响应这个号召的具体行动之一。各地区合作社领导机构应分别各就所辖范围，拟订适合本地区的清理办法，切实地掌握、领导、推动、检查。工作重点应放在基层社和县（市）社。
    在今后进行这一工作中，必须纠正部分干部的错误思想，首要是克服干部在经营上的供给制思想。如完成任务不报账，不重视资产的保管，不详细算账，以为“肉烂在锅里”，清不清是一样。这种思想，是合作社发展中的重大障碍，必须坚决清除。同时，要坚决肃清合作社中某些干部的腐化思想，严厉制裁贪污、失职分子。
    最后，为了巩固清理工作的成果，各级合作社应迅速拟订出本部门适用的各项制度，以保证堵塞各种工作上的漏洞，提高工作效率。
