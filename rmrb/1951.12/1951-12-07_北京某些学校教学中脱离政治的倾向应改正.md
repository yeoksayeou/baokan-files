    The Tendency of Some Schools in Beijing to Deviate from Politics in Teaching Should Be Corrected
    To the Editor: According to my understanding in the Sixth District of Beijing, although primary and secondary schools have made some achievements in improving teaching and enhancing students' patriotic thought, it is undeniable that some teachers' teaching still has a tendency to deviate from politics. This is extremely inconsistent with the current great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. I hope it can be thoroughly corrected. When a physics teacher at a certain school explained the reasons for the underdevelopment of modern Chinese natural science to students, he said that this was because the Chinese people did not study hard. He attributed the consequences of the long-term and cruel exploitation and oppression of the Chinese people by feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which restricted the development of social productive forces in China, to "the people's lack of diligence." This is precisely the residual thought of past imperialists and reactionary ruling classes who slandered the Chinese people.
    Some teachers believe that "science is irrelevant to politics." When a chemistry teacher talked about the importance of petroleum, he said: "Wars in the world are caused by the struggle for petroleum; Germany's defeat in World War II was because it didn't have petroleum. If an airplane doesn't have petroleum, can it still fly? Of course it will fail." It seems that the failure of the German Nazis was not due to their reactionary nature, but simply due to "lack of oil." This argument is absurd. There are also some extremely absurd statements, such as a language teacher at a certain school who actually called the Han traitor and executioner Zeng Guofan "the most visionary politician, military strategist, writer, and thinker." A history teacher at a certain school said that "history is centered on culture."
    Although the above phenomena are individual, they are very serious. Therefore, the ideological remolding of teachers is urgently needed.

### 北京某些学校教学中脱离政治的倾向应改正

    北京某些学校教学中脱离政治的倾向应改正
    编辑同志：据我在北京市第六区了解，各中小学在改进教学和提高学生的爱国主义思想方面，虽已有了一些成绩，但不可讳言，在某些教师的教学中，仍然存在着脱离政治的倾向。这与当前伟大的抗美援朝爱国运动是极不相称的。我希望能够得到彻底的改正。某校一位物理教员在向学生解释中国近代自然科学不发达的原因时说，这是由于中国人民不钻研。他把封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义长期残酷地剥削压迫中国人民，束缚中国社会生产力发展的后果，归因于“人民的不钻研”，这正是过去帝国主义者与反动统治阶级诬蔑中国人民的残余思想。
    有些教员认为“理科是与政治无关的”。有一位化学教员在说到石油的重要时，他说：“世界上的战争，都是由于争夺石油而起来的；第二次世界大战，德国战败，就是因为没有石油了。飞机没有石油，还能飞吗？当然得失败。”似乎德国纳粹的失败，不是由于他们的反动性，而是简单地由于
    “缺油”。这种论点是很荒唐的。还有一些极为荒谬的说法，如某校一位语文教师，竟把汉奸刽子手曾国藩称为“最有远见的政治家、军事家、文学家与思想家”。某校一位历史教员说“历史是以文化为中心的”。
    上面这些现象虽然是个别的，但是十分严重的，因此，教师的思想改造工作是迫切需要的。
