    State-owned Datong Coal Mine
    Promptly Promotes Advanced Experiences
    Overfulfills Production Increase and Savings Plan Last Month
    The state-owned Datong Coal Mine in Chahar Province overfulfilled its November production increase and savings plan. After completing the year's production task ahead of schedule on November 7th, the Datong Coal Mine workers submitted a letter to Chairman Mao on November 8th, proposing a further production increase and savings plan for November and December. By November 30th, the mine's coal production exceeded the original November plan by 3.6%; it saved more than 2.33 million catties of millet, exceeding the original November plan by 16.5%.
    The smooth completion of Datong Coal Mine's November production increase and savings plan was mainly due to the timely promotion of advanced workers' production experience. In November, in addition to continuing to hold regular "advanced experience dissemination classes" for various types of work and short-term training classes for coal cutter operators and drilling and blasting workers, they also established a system of holding daily experience exchange meetings for pit-mouth team leaders. This exchange played a significant role in improving production. For example, the Song Genyun mining team in Mine No. 2 created the experience of "cutting the coal seam one inch deeper, producing 18.5 more tons of coal per shift." The Sheng Diancai tunneling team in Mine No. 3 created the experience of "drilling deeper and loading more explosives." After these experiences were disseminated and implemented in various teams through the "pit-mouth experience exchange meeting," the overall mining rate of the mine increased by 6.8% compared to October, and the tunneling efficiency increased by 3.2%.
    Over the past month, the production increase and savings campaign at the Datong Coal Mine has also promoted the improvement of production management. In the past, although Datong Coal Mine had initially established specialized responsibility systems for production, safety, and shift handover, there was still a phenomenon of unclear responsibilities and inability to solve problems in a timely manner among management personnel. In this production increase and savings campaign, workers put forward more than 100 suggestions for improving production. Leaders of various mines and general management personnel deeply felt: "It won't work if we don't solve the problems in time!" In early November, Mines No. 2 and No. 3, based on the issues raised by the workers, launched a mass movement to pursue responsibility among all employees, and on this basis, initially established a specialized responsibility system for production management based on the responsibilities of management personnel such as mine directors, pit leaders, and coal mining district chiefs, as well as engineering and technical personnel. Subsequently, in the thirteen days from November 12th to 24th, more than 100 production problems raised by the workers of Mine No. 3 were resolved in a timely manner. This improvement greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. In the second half of November, workers at Mine No. 3 put forward more than 40 rationalization proposals, among which, changing the labor organization alone could save 63 man-days per day.

    国营大同煤矿
    及时推广先进经验
    上月增产节约计划超额完成
    察哈尔省国营大同煤矿超额完成了十一月份的增产节约计划。大同煤矿职工在十一月七日提前完成全年生产任务以后，曾在同月八日上书毛主席，提出十一、十二两月进一步增产节约的计划。到十一月三十日止全矿产煤超过十一月份原定计划百分之三点六；节约二百三十三万多斤小米，超过十一月份原定计划百分之十六点五。
    大同煤矿十一月份增产节约计划所以能够顺利完成，主要是及时推广了先进工人的生产经验。在十一月份中，他们除了继续定期举办各工种的“先进经验传播班”和割煤机手、打眼放炮工等在职工人的短期训练班外，还建立了每天召开井口小组长经验交流会的制度，这种交流会对提高生产起了很大作用。例如二矿宋根运回采组创造了“割煤机深割一寸，一班多出煤十八点五吨”的经验，三矿盛殿才掘进小组创造了“深打眼，多装药”的经验，这些经验经“井口经验交流会”传播在各组实行后，全矿回采率比十月份提高了百分之六点八，掘进效率提高了百分之三点二。
    一个月来，大同煤矿的增产节约运动，也推动了生产管理工作的改进。过去，大同煤矿虽已初步建立了生产、保安、交接班等专责制度，但在管理人员中还存在着职责不清，有问题不能及时解决的现象。在这次增产节约运动中工人们提出改进生产的各种建议有一百多件。各矿领导方面和一般管理人员都深切地感到：“再不及时解决问题不行了！”十一月初，二、三两矿根据工人们提出的问题，发动全体职工展开群众性的追责任运动，并在这个基础上，根据矿长、井长、采煤区长等管理人员和工程技术人员的职责，初步建立了生产管理上的专责制度。此后，在十一月十二日到二十四日的十三天中，三矿工人提出的一百多个生产上需要解决的问题就都得到了及时解决。这一改进大大鼓舞了工人们的积极性。三矿工人在十一月下半月内提出四十多件合理化建议，其中仅改变劳动组织一项，每天就可节省六十三个人工。　（新华社）
