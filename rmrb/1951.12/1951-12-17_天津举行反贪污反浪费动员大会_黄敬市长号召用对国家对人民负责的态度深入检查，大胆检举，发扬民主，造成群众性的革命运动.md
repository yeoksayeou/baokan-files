    Tianjin Holds Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Mobilization Rally
    Mayor Huang Jing Calls for In-Depth Inspection and Bold Accusations with an Attitude of Responsibility to the Country and the People, Promoting Democracy, and Creating a Mass Revolutionary Movement
    [This Newspaper's Report] Tianjin is about to launch a large-scale mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Committee and the People's Political Consultative Conference of all circles in Tianjin held a joint meeting at the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Reception Office on the afternoon of the 14th. Mayor Huang Jing made a report on launching a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The meeting decided: to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the city in the near future; to establish an economy inspection committee as a leading and promoting organization; and to approve the list of all members of the economy inspection committee; each unit and district, under the leadership of the municipal economy inspection committee, shall establish economy inspection committee branches.
    The Tianjin Municipal Economy Inspection Committee convened a mobilization rally on the afternoon of the 15th, attended by over ten thousand cadres and representatives from all walks of life in the city, regarding launching a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy throughout the city, and listened to a mobilization report by Mayor Huang Jing.
    In his report, Mayor Huang Jing first stated that, according to Chairman Mao's call and the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government, Tianjin will immediately launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy throughout the city.
    When explaining the important significance of launching this movement, he pointed out: Since liberation, the majority of our revolutionary workers have consistently maintained a clean, simple, and people-serving work style; precisely because of this, our work in the past three years has achieved considerable success. However, many cadres have been influenced by the ideology and work style of the old society, and have developed corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic tendencies. We must oppose this phenomenon and thoroughly eliminate it. Only in this way can we maintain a pure revolutionary work style and enable the country to rapidly move towards industrialization. This movement is the central link in our current work. The launch of this movement should be as vigorous as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, making it a mass revolutionary movement. He said: Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is fighting the external enemies of the people; while this movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is a struggle against the corrupt and degenerate phenomena that harm the interests of the people and arise within the people. If this phenomenon is not overcome, it will cause revolutionary workers to lose their due health; if we adopt an indifferent attitude and allow these tendencies to continue to develop, there will be a danger of the Party and the country perishing. This is a serious issue that concerns the success or failure of the revolution and the survival of the country.
    Mayor Huang Jing analyzed in detail and specifically the seriousness of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and the reasons for their occurrence. He pointed out that the serious corruption phenomenon is mainly caused by the following four reasons: (1) the influence of the Kuomintang work style; (2) the influence of the bad work style of the bourgeoisie; (3) some old cadres cannot withstand the test of victory and develop ideas of personal enjoyment; (4) insufficient vigilance on the part of municipal and unit-level leading cadres. As for the serious waste phenomenon, it is basically caused by some cadres being irresponsible for state public property and only proceeding from their own one-sided needs. The bureaucratic work style is one of the main reasons for the growth of corruption and waste. Therefore, in opposing corruption and waste, we must also oppose bureaucracy.
    Mayor Huang Jing then pointed out: This movement is also a study movement and an ideological transformation movement. He called on cadres throughout the city to actively participate in this movement, examine themselves from all aspects, deeply reflect, and dare to confess their shortcomings and mistakes; he called on everyone to vigorously report such bad phenomena with an attitude of responsibility to the country and the people. He instructed all units and districts in the city to achieve the following in carrying out this movement: (1) Top leaders must personally take responsibility, personally participate in and lead this movement, and must first sincerely conduct criticism and self-criticism. (2) Fully promote democracy, and no suppression of democracy is allowed. Moreover, it should not only be superiors inspecting subordinates, but also welcome and encourage subordinates to inspect superiors (including municipal leading organs). In addition, he also called on workers, youth, women, and people from all walks of life in the city to actively participate in this movement and assist the government in successfully completing this important political task. At the same time, he hoped that the industrial and commercial circles in the city would dare to expose and confess their own and others' bribery errors, overcome the viewpoint of pursuing profits only, and establish new business ethics.
    In his report, he put forward the principles for dealing with corrupt elements, pointing out that there is a difference in treating those who confess voluntarily and those who are reported by others. The former should be dealt with leniently; while the latter should be dealt with severely. Those who offer bribes will be punished equally with those who accept bribes.
    Finally, he instructed the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, the People's Procuratorate, the People's Court, and the personnel departments to actively engage in this work under the leadership of the Municipal Economy Inspection Committee. The scope of the inspection includes all organs, offices, and state-owned enterprises in Tianjin, including those of the central government and major administrative regions. The duration of the movement is estimated to be four months.
    Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, spoke at the meeting, calling on people in the industrial and commercial circles throughout the city to actively participate in this movement, vigorously confess and expose past bribery behaviors, thoroughly eradicate bad old habits, and establish good new habits.

    天津举行反贪污反浪费动员大会
    黄敬市长号召用对国家对人民负责的态度深入检查，大胆检举，发扬民主，造成群众性的革命运动
    【本报讯】天津市即将大张旗鼓地展开反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的群众运动。
    天津市人民政府委员会和各界人民代表协商委员会十四日下午在天津市人民政府交际处举行联席会议，由黄敬市长作了关于开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的报告。会议决定：在最近期内在全市展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动；建立节约检查委员会，作为领导推动机构；并通过节约检查委员会全体委员人选；各单位、各区在市节约检查委员会领导下，建立节约检查委员会分会。
    天津市节约检查委员会十五日下午召集全市干部、各界代表万余人举行关于在全市范围内展开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的动员大会，听取黄敬市长的动员报告。
    黄敬市长在报告中首先说明：根据毛主席的号召和中央人民政府政务院的决定，天津市将在全市范围内立即展开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动。
    他在说明开展这一运动的重要意义时指出：解放以来，我们多数革命工作人员始终保持着廉洁、朴素、为人民服务的作风；正因为如此，我们近三年来的工作，才得到了不少成绩。但是，也有不少干部受了旧社会思想作风的影响，产生了贪污浪费、官僚主义的作风。这种现象，我们必须加以反对，彻底肃清。这样，才能保持纯洁的革命工作作风，才能使国家得以迅速走向工业化。这一运动是我们当前工作的中心环节。开展这一运动要和镇压反革命一样地大张旗鼓，使之成为一个群众性的革命运动。他说：镇压反革命是和人民外部的敌人进行斗争；而这一反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，则是对人民内部产生的损害人民利益的腐化堕落现象作斗争。这种现象如果不加以克服，就会使革命工作人员失去应有的健康；如果采取麻木不仁的态度，放任这些倾向继续发展下去，就有亡党亡国的危险。这是关系革命成败、关系国家存亡的严重问题。
    黄敬市长详细具体地分析了贪污、浪费、官僚主义的严重性及其产生的原因。他指出造成这种严重的贪污现象主要有以下四种原因：（一）国民党作风的影响；（二）资产阶级坏作风的影响；（三）一些老干部经不起胜利的考验，产生个人享受思想；
    （四）市级及各单位领导干部警惕不够。至于严重的浪费现象，基本上是由于有些干部对于国家公共财物不负责任、只从自己的片面需要出发所造成的。而官僚主义作风，则是滋长贪污、浪费的主要原因之一。因此，我们反对贪污、浪费，就必须同时反对官僚主义。
    黄敬市长继而指出：这一运动也是一个学习运动、思想改造运动。他号召全市干部积极参加这一运动，从各个方面检查自己，深刻反省，勇于坦白自己的缺点和错误；号召大家以对国家、对人民负责的态度，大力检举这种恶劣现象。他指示全市各单位和各区在开展这一运动中，必须做到：（一）首长亲自负责，亲自参加和领导这一运动，并首先要诚恳地进行批评与自我批评。（二）充分发扬民主，不允许有任何压制民主的现象。而且不仅是上级检查下级，同时更应欢迎和鼓励下级检查上级（包括市级领导机关在内）。此外，他并号召全市的工人、青年、妇女以及各阶层人民群众都踊跃参加这一运动，协助政府胜利完成这一重要的政治任务。同时希望全市工商业界勇于揭露和坦白自己和别人的行贿错误行为，克服唯利是图的观点，树立新的商业道德。
    在报告中，他提出了关于贪污腐化分子的处理原则，指出对待自动坦白与被人检举是有区别的。对于前者，从轻处理；而对于后者，则决从重处理。对于行贿者与受贿者同等论罪。
    最后他指示市人民监察委员会、人民检察署、人民法院以及人事部门等，都要在市节约检查委员会领导下积极投入这一工作。检查的范围，包括全市及中央、各大行政区所有在天津的机关、办事处以及公营企业单位等。运动开展的期限，预计为四个月。
    市工商业联合会主任委员李烛尘在大会上作了发言，号召全市工商业界人士积极参加这一运动，大力坦白揭露过去的行贿行为，彻底铲除恶劣的旧作风，树立良好的新作风。
