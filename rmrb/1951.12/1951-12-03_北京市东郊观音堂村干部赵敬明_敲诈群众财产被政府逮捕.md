    Zhao Jingming, Village Cadre of Guanyintang Village in the Eastern Suburbs of Beijing,
    Arrested by the Government for Extorting Property from the Masses
    Editor: Zhao Jingming of Guanyintang Village in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, was a puppet judicial police officer before liberation, and wormed his way into the village government after liberation.
    After becoming a cadre, he oppressed the masses, extorted property from them, and his style was extremely bad. In the winter of 1949, when he didn't have a cotton coat, he extorted 122 jin of corn from four households including Li Wenxiang to make a coat. During the Spring Festival last year, he extorted 70,000 yuan from four households including Xiao Hai. This spring, he summoned the seven cart-owning households under his jurisdiction to a "meeting," asking each household to pull a cart of manure for him from the city, promising 10 jin of corn per cart. Five households pulled manure for him, but they didn't receive a single grain of corn. Around May of this year, during the issuance of land ownership certificates, he extorted about 1,000 jin of corn from the masses.
    Zhao Jingming's illegal actions aroused opposition from the entire village, and they unanimously demanded that the People's Government punish him. Now, the Tenth District People's Government of Beijing has accepted the people's opinions and has arrested Zhao and brought him to justice. Wang Zhengmin

    北京市东郊观音堂村干部赵敬明
    敲诈群众财产被政府逮捕
    编辑同志：北京市东郊观音堂村赵敬明，解放前当过伪司法警，解放后混入了村政权。
    他当上干部以后，就欺压群众，诈取群众财产，作风极其恶劣。一九四九年冬天，他没有棉大衣，便向李文祥等四户诈取玉米一百二十二斤做了大衣。去年春节，他又向萧海等四户敲诈了七万元。今年春天，他将所辖七个大车户找去“开会”，让每户从城内给他拉一车粪，说定每车给十斤玉米。有五户给他拉了粪，结果一粒玉米没给。今年五月前后，在发放土地所有证工作中，他又诈取了群众约一千斤玉米。
    赵敬明的不法行为，引起全村群众的反对，一致要求人民政府惩办他。现在，北京市第十区人民政府接受人民意见，已将赵犯逮捕法办。王政民
