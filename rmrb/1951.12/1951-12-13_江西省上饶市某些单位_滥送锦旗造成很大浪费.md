    Certain Units in Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province
    Wasteful Sending of Brocade Banners Causes Great Waste

    To the Editor: In Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province, hanging brocade banners has become customary for occasions such as the opening of night schools, the opening of stores, and even family weddings. I believe this represents a significant waste. Their notification letters often include phrases like, "We would be extremely grateful for the gift of a congratulatory banner!" Upon receiving such notices, units or individuals feel compelled to comply, leading to the indiscriminate sending of brocade banners. Otherwise, the representatives sent by these units to offer congratulations would feel they were losing "face." Some units receive so many brocade banners that they lack space to display them, forcing them to refashion them and send them to others. Still other units "generously" distribute brocade banners to cadres' family members to make clothes for their children. Because there are so many brocade banners being given, the wording on them is not always carefully considered. I saw several brocade banners hanging on the wall of a barbershop in a cooperative in Shangrao City. One of them, presented by the Municipal Cloth Industry Association, bore the words "Start From Scratch." Presumably, the person who wrote the inscription gave it some thought, but what beneficial inspiration can people derive from it? It should be said that this was a waste of that piece of several-foot-long high-quality red silk! I imagine that phenomena like the above may also exist in other regions. At a time when the government is calling for increased production and frugality, I suggest that local organizations and groups reduce or eliminate all non-essential brocade banner presentations (of course, this is not to say that presenting banners is always wrong) to save the country a fortune.　Mu Lei

### 江西省上饶市某些单位  滥送锦旗造成很大浪费

    江西省上饶市某些单位
    滥送锦旗造成很大浪费
    编辑同志：江西省上饶市有些夜校开学、商店开张和家庭举办婚事等，都要挂锦旗。我觉得这是很大一笔浪费。他们给别人的通知书上常写着“如蒙惠赐贺旗，不胜感谢！”接到通知的单位或个人便勉力应酬，滥送锦旗。不然这些单位派去庆贺的代表也会感到脸上不“光彩”。有些单位收到的锦旗太多，没有地方悬挂，不得不重新改制再送别人；还有的单位把锦旗“慷慨”分赠干部家属给孩子做衣服。因为送锦旗的太多，在题字内容上也就发生不够慎重的现象。我在上饶市某合作社理发部看到墙上挂了几面锦旗，其中一面是市布业公会赠送的，上面写着“从头做起”四个大字。大概题字人是很费了一番思索的，可是，人们从那里边能够得到什么有益的启示呢？应该说这是浪费了那一块几尺长的上等红绸布！像以上的现象，我想在其它地区也还可能有。在现在政府号召增产节约的时候，我建议各地机关团体把可送可不送的锦旗一律减免（当然不是说送旗子这件事情都是不对），为国家节省一笔财富。　慕　雷
