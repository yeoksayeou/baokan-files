Zhang Junying, a 22-year-old woman from Zhangjia Village, Gongjia Township, Fifth District, Putai County, Shandong Province, was married off by her brother last year to a partially blind man in Gongjia Village for eighty silver dollars, driven by greed. After arriving at her husband's home, Zhang Junying realized she had been deceived by her brother. Zhang Junying was so angry that she cried all day. Every time Zhang Junying returned to her parents' home, she expressed her desire for a divorce. Her brother, fearing that the "bride price" would be demanded back by the man's family if she divorced, said to her, "They have no shortage of food or clothing, and you want to divorce him just because he's blind in one eye. You're making us Zhangs lose all face." Zhang Junying insisted on fighting and finally got divorced.

After the divorce, Zhang Junying was very active in the literacy class. Later, she developed feelings for Wu Hongze, the militia captain, and they soon became engaged. When her brother found out about this, he said to her, "Wu Hongze's family is poor. What good will you get with him? Besides, you're not asking for anything; you're practically giving yourself away. I insist on making the decision for you." Her mother also said, "You were raised by me, so I should at least have half the say." Junying said, "No one can make decisions about my marriage; I'll make the decision myself!" Her mother and brother kept talking about the bride price, and when they finally saw that there was no hope, they kicked Junying out. After being kicked out, Junying found the director of the women's association in Dianzi Village and went to Wu Hongze's house together. His mother was so happy to see such a good daughter-in-law and treated her very well. After Junying got married, she actively participated in production and was praised by the villagers. Lu Ji

    张俊英不顾家长的阻挠自己做主和吴洪泽结了婚
    山东省蒲台县五区宫家乡张家庄妇女张俊英，今年二十二岁。去年，她哥哥贪图八十块银元，把她嫁给了宫家庄的一个半瞎子。张俊英到婆家后，才知道受了哥哥的骗。张俊英气得整天哭。张俊英每次回娘家，总表示要离婚。她哥哥怕离了婚，“聘礼”会被男家要回去，就对她说：“人家一不缺吃，二不缺穿，就因为瞎了一只眼，你就要跟人家离婚，俺姓张的人叫你丢净了。”张俊英坚持斗争，终于离了婚。
    离婚后，张俊英在识字班里，学习非常积极。后来她和民兵大队长吴洪泽有了感情，不久就订了婚。这事被她哥哥知道后，就对她说：“吴洪泽家里穷，你跟他有什么好处？再说，一点东西不要，还能白送上个人。我偏要给你作主。”她娘也说：“你可是我养大的，我至少也得作一半的主。”俊英说：“我的婚事谁也不能作主，我自己作主！”她娘她哥说来说去还是要聘礼，最后看看没指望，就把俊英撵了出来。俊英出来就找到店子村的妇女会主任，一同去到吴洪泽家。她婆婆看到这样一个好媳妇，喜欢得了不得，待她很好。俊英结婚以后，积极生产，很受村里群众的赞扬。　鲁绩
