    Everyone Participate in Gymnastics
    Comrade Editor: The news about promoting gymnastics published in the People's Daily has attracted the attention of many comrades. In our organization, many comrades are not healthy enough, and everyone often feels the need to exercise, but they suffer from a lack of sports equipment and venues. Individual comrades have also advocated gymnastics, but they cannot persist due to a lack of leadership. Obviously, without a good body, it is impossible to guarantee the completion of the tasks assigned by the state. At the same time, unhealthy bodies are prone to illness, causing us great losses in terms of economy and time. Therefore, we should respond to the call of the preparatory committee of the All-China Sports Federation and other nine units regarding the promotion of gymnastics, and hope that the administrative, Party, and Communist Youth League organizations of all organs, organizations, and schools across the country will support and assist this activity. Comrades participating in gymnastics should not give up halfway because they do not see significant results in the short term.

    大家都来参加体操
    编辑同志：关于推行体操的消息在人民日报发表以后，引起了许多同志的注意。我们机关里，有许多同志的身体是不够健康的，大家时常感到有锻炼身体的必要，但是苦于没有运动的设备及场地；个别同志也曾提倡体操，可是由于没有人领导而不能坚持。很显然的，没有很好的身体，是不能保证完成国家所给予的任务的。同时，不健康的身体容易生病，使我们在经济上、时间上受到很大的损失。因此，我们应该响应全国体育总会筹备委员会等九个单位关于推行体操的号召，并希望全国各机关、团体、学校的行政及党、青年团组织支持并协助这一活动。参加体操的同志，也不要因在短期内见不到显著的功效半途而废。
