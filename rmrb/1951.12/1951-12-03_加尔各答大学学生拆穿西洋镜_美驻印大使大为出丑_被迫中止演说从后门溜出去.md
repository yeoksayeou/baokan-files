Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 2nd: A Calcutta dispatch: The Bengali daily "Freedom" published a message on November 28, reporting on the embarrassing plight of the new U.S. Ambassador to India, Bowles, when he "visited" Calcutta University on November 27 and was questioned by students.

According to "Freedom," before Bowles arrived, some students stood at the entrance of the venue holding placards with slogans such as "Down with U.S. Imperialism," "Get Out of Korea," and "Get Out of Asia." In order to avoid such a reception at this entrance, the ambassador entered the venue through another door.

Bowles delivered a speech at the meeting, lavishly praising the American way of life and American "democracy" to the students of Calcutta University. The audience, however, was very cold towards Bowles. Students raised opinions one after another, exposing the American policy of aggression in Asia. The students asked the American ambassador questions such as: Why doesn't the U.S. government recognize the new Chinese government? Why does the United States support puppet regimes in Southeast Asian countries and supply them with military materials? Why does the United States oppose the people's liberation movements in those countries? Why does the United States have a network of military bases all over the world? Regarding the U.S. attitude toward Egypt, Iran, and Spain, similar sharp questions were also raised. Every time someone raised such a question, the students applauded enthusiastically. To Bowles' irrelevant answers, the students responded with shouts of "Shameless!" and "Lies!"

As a result, Bowles had to end his speech. As the American ambassador walked out of the venue, the crowd shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" and "Bowles Get Out!"

Bowles later had to sneak out of Calcutta University through the back door.

    加尔各答大学学生拆穿西洋镜
    美驻印大使大为出丑
    被迫中止演说从后门溜出去
    【新华社新德里二日电】加尔各答消息：十一月二十八日孟加拉文日报“自由报”刊载的一则消息，报道了新任美国驻印度大使鲍尔士在十一月二十七日“访问”加尔各答大学时受到学生们质问的狼狈丑态。
    据“自由报”报道，在鲍尔士还没有到会之前，就有一些学生持着标语牌站在会场入口处，牌上写着：“打倒美帝国主义”、“滚出朝鲜”、“滚出亚洲”。为了不在这个入口处受到这样的接待，这位大使便从另一个门进入会场。
    鲍尔士在会上发表演说，向加尔各答大学学生大谈美国的生活方式和美国的“民主”。听众对鲍尔士却非常冷淡。学生们纷纷提出意见，揭发美国对亚洲的侵略政策。学生们向美国大使提出这样的问题：美国政府为什么不承认新中国政府？美国为什么在东南亚各国中扶植傀儡政权，并且用军火供给他们？美国为什么反对那些国家中的人民解放运动？美国为什么在全世界遍布军事基地网？关于美国对埃及、伊朗和西班牙的态度，也有人提出了同样尖锐的责问。每一次有人提出这类的问题时，学生们都热烈地鼓掌。对于鲍尔士的牛头不对马嘴的答复，学生们都报以“不要脸！”“撒谎！”等反驳的呼声。
    结果鲍尔士不得不中止他的演说。当这位美国大使走出会场时，群众高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“鲍尔士滚蛋！”等口号。
    鲍尔士后来不得不从加尔各答大学的后门溜出去了。
