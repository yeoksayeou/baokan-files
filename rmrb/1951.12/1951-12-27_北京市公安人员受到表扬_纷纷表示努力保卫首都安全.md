    Beijing Public Security Personnel Praised, Vowing to Work Hard to Safeguard the Capital's Security
    Editor: On December 23rd, the People's Daily published a letter of commendation from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee and the Beijing Third All-Circles People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee to all public security personnel in Beijing. After seeing this letter of commendation, all comrades of the 15th Police Station of the Third Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau felt infinitely honored. Although under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the resolutions and instructions of the higher authorities and the support of the people, we have suppressed counter-revolutionaries, consolidated the revolutionary order of the capital, and ensured the safety of the lives and property of the people of the capital, we have not yet completely eliminated the remnants of counter-revolutionaries, and there are still some shortcomings in our work. Therefore, all comrades in our station guarantee to do our best, continue to raise vigilance, strengthen our work, rely on the people of the city, overcome all shortcomings in our work, consolidate and develop our strengths, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of counter-revolutionaries, and make the revolutionary order of the capital more consolidated. We will work harder to ensure the lives and property of the people of the capital are better protected. We will use such practical actions to thank the government and the people for their commendation.
        All Comrades of the 15th Police Station of the Third Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau
    Editor: When we saw the letter praising us, we felt infinitely honored. We will not forget that this honor was obtained through the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Mayor Peng Zhen, and also due to the active assistance of the people of the city. We will never be arrogant or complacent. In the future, we will work hard to correct our shortcomings. We guarantee that we will definitely raise our vigilance, strengthen our work, rely more closely on the people, eliminate all remnants of counter-revolutionaries, and make the revolutionary order of the capital more consolidated.
