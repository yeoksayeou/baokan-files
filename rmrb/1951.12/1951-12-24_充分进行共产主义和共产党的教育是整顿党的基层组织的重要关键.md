    After thirty years of great, arduous, and complex revolutionary struggles, our Party has led the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory. However, because our Party was long situated in dispersed rural areas, in an environment of intense warfare, lacking sufficient systematic education work for Party members; and due to the arrival of the nationwide victory, with a large increase in the proportion of new Party members after 1949, we have not had time to seriously conduct Communist and Communist Party education for these members; therefore, a considerable number of Party members have a low level of awareness and many erroneous understandings. Many Party members do not know that the ultimate goal of the Communist Party is to realize Communism and how to struggle to achieve this ultimate goal now, and do not understand or do not fully understand the standards of being a Communist Party member and how to achieve these standards. Some worker Party members do not know why they are actively producing now, and do not understand how to implement Communism on the basis of large-scale production. Many rural Party members believe that "having land, having cattle, having a house to live in, life is very good," and that the "ultimate goal" has now been achieved, feeling that further effort would be a loss, wanting to "change shifts and let others do it"; some have therefore developed "backsliding" thoughts; others are simply pursuing wealth and prosperity, not knowing the direction of development, and even not participating in mutual aid teams; regarding the understanding of a Communist society, there is a more widespread existence of agricultural socialist ideas such as "eating from a big pot" and "wearing the same clothes and eating when the whistle blows." These erroneous ideas seriously affect the improvement of their enthusiasm for production. Among a few Party member cadres who are detached from production, some mistakenly believe that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution means that the Chinese revolution has already been "completed," and therefore refuse the arduous tasks assigned to them by the Party; some are complacent, not seeking progress, demanding enjoyment and treatment, and even engaging in corruption. If these people are not thoroughly transformed, they do not possess or do not fully possess the conditions of a Communist Party member.
    In order to uphold and improve the conditions of a Communist Party member, to cleanse bad elements who have infiltrated the Party, to maintain the purity of the Party, and to enhance the Party's quality and combat effectiveness, so as to better complete various construction tasks, in recent months, various regions have been carrying out and are carrying out Party rectification work. In the North China and Northeast regions alone, more than 20,000 Party rectification work cadres have been deployed and trained; Party rectification experiments have been conducted in many cities and villages, and education on the Communist Party and Communism has been conducted for all Party members and some members of the Communist Youth League and activists, and the Party organizations have been rectified. As a result, the awareness of the majority of Party members has been raised, and they are willing to improve and transform themselves according to the standards of Party members, determined to be qualified Party members; other elements who are unwilling to continue to be Party members according to the standards of Party members or who are not determined to transform themselves, after education, either voluntarily withdrew from the Party or were advised to withdraw by the Party organization, and various bad elements who had infiltrated the Party were also cleared out, purifying the Party organization. After this education, the understanding of Communism among Party members and non-Party activists has been generally improved, and the life outlook of most Party members to struggle to the end for the cause of Communism has been further strengthened, and there have been significant improvements in work and production, presenting a new atmosphere. For example, after Party rectification education in factory branches, the vast majority of Party members felt that their "minds were clear," changed their attitude towards labor, and some continuously created new records. The Party organization in Shenyang successively organized and led 8,319 Communist Party members and nearly 20,000 members of the Communist Youth League to study the topic of Communism and the Communist Party. After that, they realized that all current tasks, such as increasing production and practicing economy, are to consolidate the New Democratic system and create conditions for the future transition to a socialist and communist system, and therefore production and work became more active. For example, worker Tai Fengchun from a certain factory was previously passive in production and could only complete 34 percent of his quota. After learning, his maximum production reached 200 percent of the quota; another example is that a backward workshop in a certain factory has become an advanced workshop in the factory after Party rectification and learning. The production volume in October increased by 233.3 percent compared to the production volume in July before Party rectification, the scrap rate in October decreased by 20 percent compared to the scrap rate in July, and the cost in August decreased by 15.7 percent compared to July, and 29 technicians were transferred out, winning the title of "Full House Red." Ma Xiuliang, a Party member from a certain factory in Beijing, changed his view of "relying on technology for food" during the Party rectification study and continuously created two new records. After learning, some rural Party members knew that "there is such a good society," recognized the direction of their efforts, and active Party members became more active. Party members who had "laid down" and were not working stood up, and everyone understood that "Communism is good, but lying down and not working will not achieve it," and knew that "Communism is good, but it cannot be reached without the 'bridge' of New Democracy." As a result, many Party members took the lead in organizing mutual aid teams and leading the masses to dig wells. Everyone expressed that they would work actively, produce well, and "build bridges" for Communism. According to statistics from 473 branches and 11,357 Party members in Hebei Province, after learning, 77.2 percent of the Party members were generally qualified, and 7.7 percent of the Party members, although not fully qualified, also expressed their determination to meet the standards within a certain period of time. In Beijing and Chongqing, after Party rectification education, 55.3 percent of the 2,707 probationary Party members met the standards of Party members and were transferred to full Party members; another 33.8 percent, although not fully qualified, also expressed their determination to actively make up for their shortcomings within a certain period of time and strive to meet the standards of Party members. After Party rectification education and organizational rectification, the awareness of Party members has been generally improved, boundaries have been clarified, and bad elements and degenerated elements who have infiltrated the Party have been cleansed. Party members who have made mistakes have also conducted self-criticism and made plans for correction. In this way, the Party organization has been consolidated ideologically and politically, greatly improving the Party's quality and combat effectiveness.
    However, some Party committees and leading cadres do not have a sufficiently deep understanding of the task of universally conducting education on how to be a Communist Party member for Party members, so that all Party members understand the standards of being a Communist Party member, and they do not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of conducting sufficient Party rectification education. Some believe that rectifying the Party's grassroots organizations is only a simple organizational rectification, and that the task is completed once the bad elements are cleansed and the Party members are registered; some believe that conducting sufficient education "will hinder production and work"; some believe that "work is exercise, and awareness is naturally improved, so why conduct Communist education," etc. Due to the existence of the above-mentioned erroneous understandings, the education work was not placed in its proper position in the Party rectification work, Party lesson teachers were not selected and trained, and the education was also perfunctory. Some only talked about the standards of Party members for one day, resulting in the Party rectification work becoming a formality, and the Party members' awareness was not improved or was rarely improved. Therefore, all localities must pay attention to criticizing and correcting these erroneous understandings and practices that underestimate education.
    There are also some Party committees and leading cadres who, although they have spent a lot of time and effort in carrying out Party rectification education, some even spent three months leading Party members to study the course on Communism and the Communist Party, but the results were not good, the awareness of Party members was rarely improved, and some even produced some confused ideas. These are all because the Communist and Communist Party education was not correctly explained based on the actual situation of Party members, and the education was not conducted in connection with the Party members' thoughts and work. This situation is manifested in two aspects: First, the education on Communism and the Communist Party is abstracted. The explanation is a dead recitation of articles, and it is not related to the current problems in the minds of some Party members (such as: "backsliding" thoughts, selfishness, corruption, waste, etc.), and even requires Party members to memorize the articles. This is a tendency of dogmatism that separates theory from practice. Second, the education on Communism and the Communist Party is vulgarized. Some lack a systematic explanation of the standards of Communist Party members, but instead are fragmented and address issues on a case-by-case basis. They cannot raise the problems in the minds of some Party members to the level of principles for criticism, so they cannot achieve the purpose of improving the ideological level of Party members, and some even accommodate backwardness. Some places dare not explain the issue of agricultural collectivization to Party members, and some only talk about how to enjoy happiness in a Communist society, how to "eat bread and ride in cars," etc., without explaining Communism from the perspective of class struggle and production, nor do they explain the current tasks and directions of efforts of Party members, nor do they talk about the noble morals and qualities that Communist Party members should possess, so that Party members are misled and produce some confused ideas.
    In order to launch a large-scale Party rectification study movement, to launch a large-scale study movement on the topic of Communism and the Communist Party, and to practically improve the political and ideological level of each Party member and non-Party activist in this movement, and to lay a good foundation for Party rectification and Party building work, Party committees in various regions must pay attention to correcting the deviations and shortcomings in Party rectification education, must accept the successful experiences of education conducted during Party rectification experiments in various regions, and must do a good job of educating how to be a Communist Party member.
    According to existing materials, the following points should be noted when conducting Party rectification education:
    First, it is necessary to proceed from the actual situation of Party members, correctly explain some basic principles of Communism and the Communist Party, practically solve the problems existing in the minds of Party members, and thereby improve the political and ideological level of Party members. According to the requirement of "universally conducting education on how to be a Communist Party member for Party members, so that all Party members understand the standards of being a Communist Party member," according to the current level and acceptance ability of Party members, the content of Party rectification education should not be too much, and should focus on explaining the standards of Communist Party members. The issues to be explained should be simple and clear, and appropriately linked to reality. Each lecture must require a focus on solving some problems in the minds of Party members. For example, when talking about the ultimate goal of the Party—the beautiful and happy prospect of a Communist society—Party members must not only understand, but also be educated to know how to create conditions for realizing Communism, and to criticize the "half-cut revolution" thought. However, when explaining a certain issue, it must be fully explained clearly, otherwise it is easy to make mistakes. For example, when talking about the fact that the individual interests of Party members must be subordinate to the interests of the Party, that is, the interests of the people, it must also be explained that the interests of the people are consistent with individual interests, and that under the principle of not violating the interests of the Party, the existence and development of the individual interests of Party members are allowed. Some places, when conducting education, do not take into account the realistic level of Party members, and only start from subjective wishes, requiring Party members to understand deeper theories that are too high and too far, such as when conducting Communist education, starting from the evolution of monkeys into humans, talking about the five social systems, the five economic forms, the development and changes of productive forces and production relations, and the inevitable realization of Communism, which will not be effective. On the other hand, if the level of awareness of Party members is underestimated, and it is believed that Communism cannot be explained to rural Party members, and the standards of Party members are not dared to be announced to rural Party members, or in conducting education, the learning time is evenly distributed, or even the priorities are reversed, and the efforts cannot be concentrated on explaining the standards of Communist Party members, this is also incorrect. These deviations urgently need to be corrected. In Party rectification education in various localities, more examples that can be accepted by Party members should be cited. Especially the situation of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, organize Party members to visit some factories, mines, state-owned farms or hold Soviet photo exhibitions, show movies, slides, etc., according to possible conditions, which is of great help to Communist and Communist Party education. At the same time, it is necessary to organize discussions well and strengthen individual assistance to Party members, so that Party members can understand the spirit of the documents, link themselves, and conduct necessary self-criticism, so that Party members can demand and improve themselves according to the standards. In order to provide specific assistance to Party members with a low level of education and poor awareness, some places have leaders of Party rectification work and activists to carry out appropriate division of labor and implement the "contract learning system," adopting a combination of collective lectures and individual education, which can be adopted by various localities as appropriate.
    Second, in order to correctly conduct Party rectification education and lead Party members to learn the standards of Communist Party members, there should be a group of teachers with considerable political accomplishment and theoretical level. In addition to personally leading and personally lecturing on Party rectification education, responsible comrades of Party committees in many regions have also paid attention to cultivating and training Party lesson teachers. For example, in Beijing and Shenyang, under the direct leadership of the municipal Party committee, 672 cadres with considerable political and theoretical level were selected and hired as Party lesson teachers, and more than 1,800 cadre Party members who were more outstanding and had a considerable level of education were selected from grassroots organizations as teaching assistants or counselors. The municipal Party committee hired responsible cadres with higher political and theoretical levels and professors from senior political schools to train and educate these teachers, teaching assistants, and counselors through lectures and intensive training. The Changzhi in Shanxi formed a lecture group composed of cadres with higher political and theoretical levels drawn from the organs of the local Party committee under the leadership of the local Party committee and went to various places to give Party lessons. The Provincial Party Committee of Hebei Province intensively trained cadres from the Party rectification training groups in various counties, and trained Party members or backbone members in Party members by county to prepare for Party rectification. In this way, better results were achieved in Party rectification education, and some experiences in conducting Party rectification education were created. However, in some areas, the Party committee did not pay enough attention to this issue, so that the Party rectification cadres were not trained, or cadres with better political theory were not selected to give Party lessons, resulting in the phenomenon of random lectures, so that Party rectification education could not achieve the due effect, which should be paid attention to and corrected.
    Third, in order to ensure that there is sufficient time for Party rectification education, it is necessary to properly resolve the contradiction between production, work, and learning. After Party rectification mobilization in rural branches, mobilize all Party members to discuss, everyone think of ways, and everyone establish a covenant to ensure that production, learning, and work are not delayed. First of all, Party members divide the work in the village, and Party members who are engaged in administrative work take some time to work in the village office; Party members lead the masses in groups, respond to the call, and complete various work tasks. Secondly, for Party members who have difficulties, everyone think of ways to help them, and Party members voluntarily combine to organize mutual aid teams to ensure that production is not delayed during the study period. However, it should generally be noted that during the busy farming season, try to use the evening for learning, and the learning time should not be too long each time, so as not to affect production; in the slack farming season, in addition to adhering to evening learning, a certain amount of time can be set aside during the day for learning, according to the specific situation. The experience of Party rectification in various localities has proved that during the period of Party rectification, due to the increased enthusiasm of Party members, everyone works together, and the work in the village will be greatly activated. In factories, it is necessary to properly arrange the time for workers' spare time activities, set aside a certain amount of time each week for Party rectification study, and other activities can be suspended or reduced. For example, the activities of the Communist Youth League can be appropriately reduced because the members of the Communist Youth League have participated in the study. The learning time for urban workers is best planned and arranged uniformly by the provincial and municipal leading organs.
    The leading organs of the Party at all levels must realize that fully conducting the education of how to be a Communist Party member is the key to completing the Party rectification work, and it is necessary to pay great attention to the leadership of the Party rectification education work, and constantly improve and enhance our Party rectification education work, and ensure that this Party rectification movement, like other movements led by our Party, will achieve a great victory.

    充分进行共产主义和共产党的教育是整顿党的基层组织的重要关键
    我们党经过了三十年来伟大的、艰苦卓绝的和复杂的革命斗争，已经领导中国人民取得了革命的胜利。但是，由于我们党过去是长期处在分散的农村中，处在紧张的战争的环境里，对党员缺乏充分的系统的教育工作；又由于全国胜利形势的到来，一九四九年后新党员比重的大量增加，我们还没有来得及对这些党员认真地进行共产主义和共产党的教育；因此，有相当一部分党员，觉悟程度不高，有着许多的错误认识。许多党员不知道共产党的最终目的是为了实现共产主义和现在应该如何为达到这个最终目的而斗争，不懂得或不太了解做一个共产党员的标准和如何达到这个标准。有些工人党员不知道现在积极生产是为了什么，不了解怎样在大生产的基础上实行共产主义。很多农村党员认为“有了地、有了牛、有了房住，生活就顶好了”，现在就是达到了“最终目的”，感到再干就赔本，想“换换班，叫别人干”；有的就产生了“退坡”思想；有的则单纯地追求发家致富，不知道发展的方向，甚至连互助组也不参加；对于共产主义社会的认识，则较普遍地存在着“吃大锅饭”“穿一样的衣服，吃饭吹哨子”等农业社会主义思想。这些错误思想严重影响着他们的生产积极性的提高。在少数脱离生产的党员干部中，有的则错误地认为中国人民革命胜利就是中国革命业已“完成”，因而拒绝党所分配给他们的艰苦的任务；有的居功自傲，不求上进，闹享受，闹待遇，甚至于贪污腐化。这些人，如果不加以彻底改造，是不具备或不完全具备一个共产党员的条件的。
    为了坚持和提高共产党员的条件，清洗混入党内的坏分子，保持党的纯洁性，增强党的质量和战斗力，以便更好地完成各种建设任务，近几个月来，各地都进行了并且正在进行着整党工作，仅华北、东北两区就调配和训练了整党工作干部两万多人；在许多城市和农村中进行了整党试验，对全体党员和一部分青年团员、积极分子进行了关于共产党和共产主义的教育，整顿了党的组织。因而大多数党员的觉悟提高了，愿意按照党员标准提高和改造自己，决心做一个够标准的党员；另外一些不愿意按照党员标准继续作一个党员或者没有决心改造的分子，经过教育，则自动退党或由党的组织劝其退党，混进党内的各种坏分子也被清除出去，纯洁了党的组织。经过这次教育，普遍地提高了党员和非党积极分子对共产主义的认识，大多数党员为共产主义事业奋斗到底的人生观更加坚定了，工作和生产都有显著的改进，呈现了一种新的气象。如在工厂支部中经过整党教育，绝大多数党员觉得“脑子清醒了”，转变了劳动态度，有的连续创造了新纪录。沈阳市的党组织先后组织和领导八千三百十九名共产党员、近两万青年团员，学习了关于共产主义和共产党这一课题以后，认识到当前的一切任务，如增产节约等，都是为着巩固新民主主义制度和将来转变到社会主义、共产主义制度创造条件，因而生产、工作更加积极。如某厂工友台凤春，过去生产消极，只能完成定额的百分之三十四，经过学习，他的最高生产量达到定额的百分之二百；又如某厂一个落后车间，经过整党学习已变成全厂的先进车间，十月份的生产量比整党前的七月份的生产量增加了百分之二百三十三点三，十月份的废品率比七月份的废品率降低百分之二十，八月份的成本比七月份的降低了百分之十五点七，并抽调出技工二十九名，荣获“满堂红”的称号。北京市某厂党员马秀良，在整党学习中改变了“凭技术吃饭”的观点，连续创造两次新纪录。一些农村党员经过学习，知道了“有这么好的社会”，认清了努力的方向，积极的党员更加积极了，“躺倒”不干的党员站起来了，大家懂得了“共产主义好，躺倒不干到不了”，并且知道“共产主义好，没有新民主主义的‘桥’到不了”。于是有很多党员带头组织互助组，领导群众打井，大家表示要积极工作，好好生产，为共产主义“搭桥”。据河北省四百七十三个支部一万一千三百五十七个党员的统计，经过学习后有百分之七十七点二的党员大体上够了标准，有百分之七点七的党员虽不完全够标准，也都表示决心在一定的时间内达到标准。北京、重庆两市，经过整党教育，在二千七百○七个候补党员中，百分之五十五点三已够了党员标准，转为正式党员；另有百分之三十三点八虽还不完全够标准，也表示决心在一定的时间内积极补课，争取达到党员的标准。经过整党教育和组织整顿后，党员的觉悟普遍提高，划清了界限，清洗了混进党内来的坏分子和蜕化堕落分子。犯了错误的党员也进行了自我检讨，并作出了改正的计划。这样，从思想上政治上巩固了党的组织，大大提高了党的质量和战斗力。
    但有些党委和领导干部，对于普遍向党员进行一次关于怎样作一个共产党员的教育，使所有的党员都明白做一个共产党员的标准的任务，还认识得不够深刻，对于进行充分的整党教育的重要意义还认识不足。有的认为整顿党的基层组织，只是一种单纯的组织上的整顿，把坏分子一清洗，党员一登记，就算完成了任务；有的认为进行充分的教育“会妨碍生产和工作”；有的认为：“工作就是锻炼，觉悟是自然而然的提高的，何必进行共产主义的教育”等。由于存在着上述的错误认识，因此，在整党工作中，没有把教育工作放到应有的地位，对党课教员不加选择和训练，进行教育也是潦草的。有的把党员的标准只讲一天，结果使整党工作流于形式，党员觉悟没有提高或很少提高。因此各地必须注意批判和纠正这些轻视教育的错误认识和作法。
    还有些党委和领导干部，虽然在进行整党教育中花费了很多的时间和很大的力量，有的竟用了三个月的时间去领导党员学习共产主义和共产党这一课程，但结果并不好，党员的觉悟很少提高，有的反而产生了一些糊涂观念。这些都是由于在进行共产主义和共产党的教育时，没有根据党员的实际情况作正确的讲解，没有联系党员的思想和工作进行教育。这种情形表现在两个方面：一是把共产主义和共产党的教育抽象化，讲解时死搬条文，而和某些党员当前思想上存在着的问题（如：“退坡”思想、自私自利、贪污浪费等）毫不联系，甚至要求党员背诵条文。这是一种理论脱离实践的教条主义的偏向。一是把共产主义和共产党的教育庸俗化，有的对共产党员的标准，缺乏系统的讲解，而是零零碎碎，就事论事，对某些党员思想上存在的问题，不能提高到原则上去批判，所以也就不能达到提高党员思想水平的目的，甚至有的还迁就落后。有些地方就不敢向党员讲解农业集体化的问题，有的只讲共产主义社会如何享福，如何“吃面包、坐汽车”等，而不从阶级斗争和生产观点上来解释共产主义，也不讲解党员当前的任务和努力方向，不讲共产党员应当具备共产主义的高尚道德和品质，以致使党员发生错觉，产生一些糊涂思想。
    为了开展一个巨大规模的整党学习运动，开展一个巨大规模的关于共产主义和共产党这一课题的学习运动，并在这个运动中实际地提高每个党员和非党积极分子的政治、思想水平，为整党、建党工作打下良好的基础，各地党委必须注意纠正在整党教育中的偏向和缺点，必须接受各地在整党试验时进行教育中的成功的经验，必须做好怎样做一个共产党员的教育工作。
    根据现有的材料，在进行整党教育工作时，应该注意下列各点：
    第一、必须从党员的实际情况出发，正确地讲解共产主义和共产党的一些基本原则，实际地解决党员思想上存在的问题，借以提高党员的政治、思想水平。根据“对党员普遍进行一次关于怎样作一个共产党员的教育，使所有的党员都明白做一个共产党的标准”的要求，按照党员的现有水平和接受能力，整党教育内容不宜过多，应集中讲解共产党员的标准。讲的问题要简单明确，并适当地联系实际，每讲必须要求有中心地解决党员思想上的一些问题。如讲党的最终目的——共产主义社会的美满幸福的远景的时候，不但要使党员了解，并且要教育党员知道应如何为实现共产主义而创造条件，批判“半截革命”思想。但在讲解某一个问题时，则必须全面的交待清楚，否则易出偏差。如讲党员个人利益必须服从党的利益即人民的利益时，同时必须说明人民利益和个人利益的一致性，在不违背党的利益的原则下，允许党员个人利益的存在和发展。有的地方在进行教育时，不照顾党员的现实水平，单从主观愿望出发，过高过远地要求党员了解更深的理论，如在进行共产主义教育时，从猴子变人讲起，讲到五种社会制度，五种经济形态，生产力和生产关系的发展变化和共产主义的必然实现等，这是不会有效果的。另一方面，如果过低的估计党员的觉悟水平，认为对农村党员不能讲解共产主义，不敢向农村党员宣布党员标准，或在进行教育中，平均分配学习时间，甚至轻重倒置，不能集中力量讲解共产党员的标准，也是不对的。这些偏向急需纠正。各地在整党教育中，应多举一些为党员所能接受的实例。特别是一些苏联社会主义建设的情况，根据可能的条件，组织党员参观一些工厂、矿山、国营农场或举行苏联画片展览，放映电影、幻灯等，这对进行共产主义和共产党的教育的帮助是很大的。同时，要很好地组织讨论和加强对党员的个别帮助，使党员领会文件的精神，联系自己，进行必要的检讨，这样可使党员按照标准来要求和提高自己。为了对文化水平较低、觉悟较差的党员进行具体帮助，有的地方由领导整党工作的干部和积极分子进行适当分工，实行“包学制”，采用集体讲课和个别教育相结合的方法，各地可酌情采用。
    第二、为了正确地进行整党教育，领导党员学习共产党员的标准，应有一批具有相当的政治修养和理论水平的教员。许多地区的党委负责同志除对整党教育亲自领导和亲自讲授外，还注意了培养训练党课教员。如北京、沈阳两市都在市委的直接领导下，选聘具有相当的政治理论水平的干部六百七十二名作党课教员，并在基层组织中选择较优秀而且有相当文化程度的干部党员，约一千八百多人作助教或辅导员。并由市委聘请了一些政治理论水平较高的负责干部和高级政治学校的教授对这些教员、助教、辅导员，以讲座、集训等方法进行了训练教育。山西长治在地委领导下，由地委机关抽出政治理论水平较高的干部组成了讲师团，分赴各地讲授党课。河北省省委集训了各县整党训练团的干部，并以县为单位训练党员或党员中的骨干分子，为整党做好了准备工作。这样，就在整党教育中收到了较好的效果，并创造了一些进行整党教育的经验。但也有些地区因党委对这一问题重视不够，以致对整党干部没有加以训练，或没有选择政治理论较好的干部讲授党课，结果发生乱讲的现象，致使整党教育不能收到应有效果，这应引起注意，并加以纠正。
    第三、为了保证有充分的时间进行整党教育，要适当地解决生产、工作和学习的矛盾。在农村支部中经过整党动员以后，发动全体党员讨论，大家想办法，大家订立公约，保证生产、学习、工作三不误。首先，党员对村里的工作进行分工，担任行政工作的党员，抽出一定的时间到村公所办公；党员分片带领群众，响应号召，完成各种工作任务。其次，对于有困难的党员，大家想办法予以帮助，并由党员自愿结合，组织互助组，保证在学习期间不误生产。但一般应注意：农忙季节尽量利用晚上学习，每次学习时间不宜过长，以免影响生产；在农闲季节可以按具体情况，除坚持夜晚学习外，并可在白天抽出一定时间进行学习。各地整党的经验证明，在整党期间由于党员的积极性提高，大家一齐动手，村里工作会大大的活跃起来的。在工厂中就要很好地安排工人业余活动的时间，每周抽一定的时间进行整党学习，其余活动可暂停或减少，如团的活动，因团员都参加了学习，就可以适当减少。对于城市工人中的学习时间最好由省、市领导机关统一计划安排。
    各级党的领导机关一定要认识充分地进行怎样做一个共产党员的教育是完成整党工作的关键，要很好地重视整党教育工作的领导，不断地改进和提高我们的整党教育工作，保证这次整党运动像我党所领导的其他运动一样，获得伟大的胜利。
