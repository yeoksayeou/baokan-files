    Employees of the Chongqing Branch of China Department Store
    Participate in Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Competition
    All employees of the state-owned Chongqing Branch of China Department Store have decided to participate in the patriotic production increase and thrift competition proposed by the employees of the Northwest China Branch of China Department Store, putting forward seven conditions, including "Guaranteeing to save 427 million yuan in commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter of this year."

    Since the employees of the Chongqing Branch of China Department Store launched the patriotic labor emulation movement in October, their work enthusiasm has generally increased. In November, the company conducted a "commodity line-up" operation, clarified the situation of all materials, carefully checked the price tags of various commodities, and adjusted the price tags of more than 1,000 commodities that were previously priced too high; at the same time, it actively dealt with slow-moving and unpopular goods. In addition to establishing two more low-priced departments, the company also organized more than ten sales teams to promote sales in factories, schools, and suburban market towns. These efforts have resulted in a monthly increase in the company's sales volume. For example, the amount of currency recovered in November increased by 21% compared to October and 64% compared to August.

    中国百货公司重庆市公司职工
    参加爱国增产节约竞赛
    国营中国百货公司重庆市公司全体职工决定参加中国百货公司西北区公司职工提出的爱国增产节约竞赛，提出了“保证今年第四季度节省商品流转费用四亿二千七百万元”等七项条件。
    中国百货公司重庆市公司职工们从十月份展开爱国主义劳动竞赛运动后，工作热情普遍提高。十一月间，该公司曾进行一次“商品排队”工作，弄清了所有物资的情况，并且仔细检查了各种商品的牌价，调整了一千多种过去价格偏高的商品牌价；同时积极地处理了冷、背货。该公司除已增设两个廉价部外，还组织了十多个推销小组到各工厂、学校和郊区集镇推销。这些努力已使该公司卖货额逐月增大，如十一月份回笼货币就比十月份增加百分之二十一，比八月份增加百分之六十四。
