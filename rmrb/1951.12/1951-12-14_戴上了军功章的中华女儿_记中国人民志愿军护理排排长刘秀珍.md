    The Chinese Daughter Adorned with Military Medals
    ——A Record of Liu Xiuzhen, Nursing Platoon Leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
  　Zigang
    (I)
    Twenty-one-year-old Liu Xiuzhen, the nursing platoon leader of a certain unit of the People's Volunteer Army, was selected as a representative to attend the National Day observation delegation.
    "Comrade Xiuzhen, this time back to the motherland, be sure to tell the story of the Volunteer Army's heroic fight against the enemy!" Everyone in the platoon she led exhorted their female platoon leader in this way. Liu Xiuzhen, her small eyes narrowed into a line when she smiled, almost ruined from the early mornings and late nights since entering Korea, said, "I know, I must tell the people of the motherland about the situation here. You can rest assured and work!"
    Those Korean old women and children, hearing that Platoon Leader Liu was returning home, came to see her off, reluctant to part. Later, knowing she was going and coming back, they were all smiles again. An old woman said, "You should also talk about the hard work of your nursing, like you, Platoon Leader Liu, such a thin and small figure that a gust of wind could blow away, can actually carry dozens of Volunteer Army comrades in one go!" In the ten months in Korea, she could already understand these few common Korean words.
    Being able to participate in the National Day observation delegation and return to the country was a great excitement and honor for Liu Xiuzhen. Since she went to Korea last November, she had been involved in rescue work on the western front, always very close to the front line. Carrying working cadres out of smoky mountain caves, carrying soldiers off trains under enemy aircraft strafing, rescuing soldiers when the floodwaters came over, and transfusing blood to save soldiers' lives when she was sick and had a fever. Besides nursing work, she also worked as a cook and did all kinds of chores, turning a solid Liu Xiuzhen into a thin strip. The organization wanted her to rest, but it seemed that every cell in her body was burning, not knowing hunger or fatigue. Regarding the organization's care, she said:
    "No one else is resting, should I be the only one resting? I am determined to be as unafraid of hardship and difficulty as the soldiers. I will only rest when the Korean people are liberated."
    Liu Xiuzhen, wearing the military medal given by General Kim Il-sung, boarded the train back to the country. On her chest, there was also a brilliant medal with Chairman Mao's image. The military medal was silver-gray, engraved with a soldier wearing a rifle across his back, with red and white striped ribbons on top. The luster of the metal set off each returning Volunteer Army representative, making them appear even more heroic and high-spirited.
    Liu Xiuzhen's hometown is in Jixian County, Hebei. She joined the revolution in October 1947 and went to Hunan. Last November, she went abroad to resist America and aid Korea, and had not seen the motherland for a full ten months. Liu Xiuzhen grew up in a middle-peasant family with her uncle and aunt since she was little, and did not even know what it was like to miss her deceased parents, but the longing for the motherland made her experience the longing for her parents. When she was so tired from work that she was dizzy, she secretly said: Be strong, this is for the motherland! When she and the Korean people and working comrades had finished rescuing the wounded and sick, and all hid in the trees, waiting for the flood to recede, she gritted her teeth and persevered, thinking: This is for the people! When squatting down to carry the wounded and sick, the soldiers often said: "Forget it, you're so thin, can you carry me?" She was both laughing and angry:
    "I am a Communist Party member, and when I came to Korea, I swore an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Based on this, I have to carry you!"
    As the train got closer and closer to the Yalu River, Liu Xiuzhen and her companions became more and more excited. Everyone was like guessing riddles, wondering how beautiful the motherland had become. Liu Xiuzhen was eager to see how the chimneys in the motherland's factories were smoking. In the past ten months, from the scattered newspapers of the motherland she saw, she loved to read the news of construction. She thought to herself, when the American imperialists are defeated, she would also have to learn some technology. At the front, she had received comfort bags sent by the people of the motherland, which contained letters, small books, needles, daily necessities, and even small toys like cloth dolls. Liu Xiuzhen wrote back to the person who wrote the comfort letter, saying that as long as she knew that the motherland's construction was becoming more and more brilliant, she would not feel the bitterness and fatigue in her work. She took the lead in proposing the slogan "overcome difficulties" in nursing work and challenged other groups.
                (II)
    As soon as Liu Xiuzhen arrived in Korea, she learned to rescue working cadres who were suffocated by smoke in the mountain caves. In order to avoid enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, the train stopped in the mountain caves during the day, and the coal smoke was unbearable. Liu Xiuzhen and other nursing staff wore towels soaked in cold water on their mouths and carried people from the train in the seven-mile-long cave. More than fifty comrades fainted. Liu Xiuzhen successively carried seven people this time. Once, during the transportation, she herself fainted at the entrance of the cave. When she woke up a little, she grabbed the dirty ice on the ground and put it in her mouth to moisten her throat and boost her spirits. Although her head was still hurting badly, she went to carry people again. Eighteen-year-old Du Lanying, who was even shorter than her, relayed at the entrance of the cave, and when the fainted people recovered, she carried them up the mountain. This time, Liu Xiuzhen began to perform meritorious service.
    Soon she became the acting deputy leader of the first group. This group had a total of four people and was responsible for finding houses, getting food, changing medicine, and all kinds of chores. They left the sorghum rice for the wounded and sick to eat, and they themselves ground the dried radish seedlings, mixed them with fried flour dregs, and made buns. Afraid that the wounded would not be comfortable eating sand, they punched holes in gasoline drum lids and used them as sieves. Without rice bowls, they rubbed rice balls for the wounded to eat. When they arrived at a place, they first dug air-raid shelters and changed the wounded's medicine in the caves during the day. They tore their own sheets as bandages. Lacking dressings to directly cover the wounds, they dismantled the staff's masks, steamed and disinfected them, and then used them. They also had to chop firewood themselves. Boiling water or disinfecting equipment was all done in the mountain caves by setting up a fire and using steel helmets. They cut scrap iron into shovels and spoons, and used bamboo skewers instead of tweezers.
    Liu Xiuzhen performed meritorious service again by rescuing the wounded in the case of planes making 'ga-ga' sounds, and bullets flying swishing sounds. As soon as the rescue was completed, the houses where the wounded originally lived caught fire and burned, but not a single wounded was lost. The wounded originally did not want her to carry them, but Liu Xiuzhen stubbornly rescued seven wounded who could not move. She said: "We must be together in life and death, this is our guarantee to you."
    When she went to work in the first company from the third company, she and her seven group members had carried many wounded, and although the Korean Labor Party members helped, their seven people only took care of the seriously wounded, but one person still had to do the work of a dozen people. Male nurse Yu Jiang, only twenty years old, ruined his eyes due to overwork. He insisted on working even when he could only open one eye and never wanted to rest. Under the mutual encouragement of the comrades, Liu Xiuzhen worked even more selflessly. She gave two hundred cc of blood to two dying wounded when she was sick and had a fever. After they recovered their health, they were deeply moved when they saw Liu Xiuzhen's thin appearance and asked the hospital department to record her meritorious service. Once, a car brought many frostbite wounded. She and the head nurse received them together, carrying more than forty people on their backs all night, and placing them one by one in scattered civilian houses half a mile away. Later, the driver comrades also came to help, and they completed the task overnight. Liu Xiuzhen often said to those who persuaded her to rest: It doesn't matter if one of me dies, saving one of them is like fighting several more enemies. Don't forget our oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait!
    It rained a lot in Korea in May and June, but there was also a big flood in the western front this September. One night, when Liu Xiuzhen learned that there would be a flood, she immediately notified the company headquarters and prepared to move at the same time. The surgery ward was in a low-lying area, and the wounded had to be carried to the high ground. They rescued all the more than one hundred seriously wounded and put them in the air-raid shelter, blocking the door. Heavy rain was pouring on top, and the water below was knee-deep. The lightly wounded and nursing staff all went up the trees. Those with great strength also helped the Korean people hold their children. Some of the female comrades lost their grip and fell down, but were pulled up by their comrades. Everyone stood in the trees for eleven or twelve hours. When Liu Xiuzhen was in the tree, she also said to everyone:
    "The difficulties are temporary, but the victory is permanent, we must be determined to overcome them!"
    Liu Xiuzhen remembers the model deeds of many comrades very clearly, such as Doctor Li, who went to save the wounded while braving the fire with a slab on his head, and Yang Zhimin, who covered the wounded with his body, fearing that the plane would strafe them… "We are all ordinary people, but we are undergoing extraordinary tests. As a Communist Party member, we must not bow to difficulties. I want to learn from these comrades around me!" She wrote in her diary.
                (III)
    When they stepped on the soil of the motherland, each soldier was extremely excited. Just across the river, but it was two different worlds. In a place not burned by the flames of war, people lived so happily! In the farmland, there were golden crops, just in the harvest season; in the factory area, the roar of machines replaced the sound of airplanes and artillery. Children went to school with their schoolbags on their backs, singing songs to resist America and aid Korea. The buses and trams in the city were so busy, but the order was very good.
    Returning to the motherland and receiving a warm welcome from the people, Liu Xiuzhen felt very sorry. "What have I done for the people of the motherland? I'm really ashamed!" Whenever it was her turn to speak or give a report, she always couldn't forget these two sentences. She also thanked the construction of the motherland, which made the motherland, which had only been established for two years, so decent, with people having food and clothing, and the machines in the factories getting better and better. When visiting the Northeast, Liu Xiuzhen listened to the explanations of the worker comrades and congratulated them on their new records. Many old men and old women became models, and the children's level of awareness and learning enthusiasm were so high that Liu Xiuzhen was overjoyed. Whenever she saw someone, she always said: The people of the motherland have made great contributions. It doesn't matter if we suffer a little bit in Korea.
    When she arrived at the Beijing Railway Station, she received a warm welcome from the people of the capital. Liu Xiuzhen's feet were not on the ground at all and she was lifted out of the station by the welcoming crowd. "What is going on, we have become sweet treats. Quickly tell the comrades in Korea about the love of the people of the motherland for us, we have to be worthy of the people of the motherland." She said to her companions in the hostel, and wrote to her companions in Korea overnight. Liu Xiuzhen only began to learn culture after joining the army, and she herself was not satisfied with her ability to take notes, but this time when she wrote a letter, there were endless words to write.
    The memorable September 30th. That night, Chairman Mao hosted a banquet for meritorious officials and VIPs in Huairen Hall. Liu Xiuzhen's seat was too far away from the Chairman, and she was not tall, so she kept looking back and did not move her chopsticks. She and three female Volunteer Army comrades went to toast Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao shook hands with them with both hands and said with a smile: "You have worked hard!"
    The three female comrades just smiled and only said "Wish Chairman good health". All the many other words they had prepared were thrown to the winds. Back at the hostel, everyone was so excited that they couldn't sleep well.
    "Who gave this happiness, to be able to see Chairman Mao and get his praise?" Liu Xiuzhen thought, lying on her pillow. From the studies of the past two or three years, Liu Xiuzhen has also roughly understood the suffering of the Chinese people for more than a hundred years, and only feels that this younger generation is really lucky, and is filled with gratitude to the Party and to Chairman Mao.

    戴上了军功章的中华女儿
    ——记中国人民志愿军护理排排长刘秀珍
  　子冈
    （一）
    二十一岁的刘秀珍，是人民志愿军某部护理排排长，被选为参加国庆节观礼代表团的代表。
    “秀珍同志，这次回到祖国，好好儿把志愿军英勇打敌人的故事讲一讲啊！”她领导的这一排，人人这样嘱咐他们的女排长。刘秀珍呢，一双细小眼睛笑起来眯成一条线，因为入朝以来总是起早睡晚，眼睛几乎熬坏了。她说：“我知道，我一定要好好地把这里的情形告诉给祖国人民。你们放心工作吧！”
    那些朝鲜老大娘和孩子们听说刘排长要回国，都依依不舍地来送行。后来知道她去了还回来，又都喜笑颜开了。一位老大娘说：“也应该把你们护理工作的辛苦讲讲，就像你刘排长，连一阵风都吹得起来的瘦小个子，竟然一口气能接连背几十个志愿军同志！”到朝鲜十个月，这几句普通朝鲜话她已经能听懂了。
    能参加国庆节观礼代表团回国一趟，刘秀珍感到十分兴奋和光荣。去年十一月她到朝鲜以来就参加西线救护工作，一直离火线很近。在烟薰的山洞里往外背工作干部，在敌人的飞机扫射下从火车上往外背战士，在大水漫过来的时候抢救战士，在自己有病、身子发烧的情况下输血挽救战士的性命。护理工作之外兼做伙夫及一切勤杂事件，把一个结结实实的刘秀珍熬成一个细条条了。组织上要她休息，她却好似每一个细胞都在燃烧，不知饿也不知累地工作。对于组织上的爱护，她这样说：
    “同志们谁也没休息，就我一个人休息吗？我是有决心和战士们一样不怕艰难困苦的，什么时候解放了朝鲜人民，我才休息哩。”
    刘秀珍挂上金日成将军送给的军功章，才搭上了回国的列车。在她胸上还有一个有毛主席像的光辉灿烂的奖章。军功章是银灰色的，镌着一个穿大敞背枪的战士，上面是红白条的丝带。金属的光泽把一个个回国的志愿军代表衬托得更加雄赳赳气昂昂了。
    刘秀珍的老家在河北蓟县。她在一九四七年十月参加革命，到过湖南。去年十一月为了抗美援朝出了国，足足十个月没见祖国的面了。刘秀珍从小跟叔叔婶婶在一个中农家庭里长大，也不知道想死去的爹娘，但是对祖国的想念，使她体会了对爹娘的挂恋。当她工作疲累得头晕眼花，她暗地里说：坚强一点，这是为了祖国！当她和朝鲜人民以及工作同志们抢救完了伤病员，一齐躲到树枝上，等待大水落下去时，又咬着牙坚持，她想：这是为了人民！当蹲下背伤病员的时候，战士们往往说：“去你的吧，你那么瘦小，背得了我？”她又笑又气：
    “我是一个共产党员，在到朝鲜来的时候，对着毛主席像宣过誓来的，凭着这一点，我也得背起你来！”
    当列车越来越近鸭绿江时，刘秀珍和她的伙伴们越来越激动了，大家像猜谜似的，不知道祖国变得多么漂亮。刘秀珍一心想看看祖国工厂里的烟囱在怎样地冒烟，十个月来从零星看到的祖国报纸上，她就爱看建设的消息。她心想，等着把美帝国主义打败，自己也得学点技术。在前方曾经拿到过祖国人民送来的慰问袋，里面有信、小书、针线、日用品，甚至小布人之类的小玩意儿。刘秀珍给写慰问信的人写过回信，她说她只要知道祖国的建设越来越辉煌，就不觉得工作中的苦累。她带头在护理工作中提出“克服困难”的口号，向别的组挑战。
                （二）
    刘秀珍刚一到朝鲜，就学着在山洞里抢救被烟呛晕了的工作干部。因为躲避敌机的轰炸扫射，白天火车在山洞里停，煤烟叫人受不了。刘秀珍和其他护理人员口上戴了用凉水沾湿的毛巾，在七里长的山洞里从列车上背人。晕过去的有五十几个同志。刘秀珍这一次陆续背了七个人。有一次在运送途中她自己也晕倒在洞门口了。稍苏醒时，她抓起地上结的脏冰往口里送，润润咽喉，提提精神，虽然脑袋还是疼得厉害，她就又去背人了。比她更矮小的十八岁的杜兰英在洞口接力，等晕过去的人缓过气来，再往山上背。这一次刘秀珍就开始了立功。
    不久她当了第一组的代理副组长，这个组一共四个人，要负责找房子、搞粮食、换药和一切勤杂事务。高粱米留给伤病员吃，他们自己把干萝卜秧子磨碎，合上炒面渣子作饽饽吃。怕伤员吃着砂子不合适，在汽油筒盖子上凿了洞当筛子使用。没有饭碗，给伤员们揉饭疙瘩吃。到一个地方，先挖防空洞，白天在洞里给伤员换药。撕了自己的床单当绷带。缺乏直接蒙盖伤口的敷料，就把工作人员的口罩拆下来蒸煮消毒后用。自己还得去打柴。烧开水或消毒器械，都是在山洞里架上火，在钢盔里办的。把废铁剪成铲子和汤匙，用竹钎子代替镊子。
    刘秀珍又一次立功是在飞机呷呷响、子弹刷刷飞的情况下抢救伤员。刚刚抢救完毕，伤员原住的屋子就起火燃烧了，而伤员没有一个损失。伤员们本来都不肯让她背了，可是刘秀珍执拗地把七个不能动的伤员救了出来，她说：“我们生死都得在一起，这是我们对你们的保证。”
    当她由三连到一连工作的时候，曾经由他们七个组员抬扶许多伤员，虽有朝鲜劳动党党员们帮忙，她们七个人只管重伤伤员，但是一个人也还得顶十几个人的工作。男护士于江，才二十岁，由于过度工作把眼睛熬坏了，他在只能睁一条线的情况下也坚持工作，从来不肯休息。刘秀珍在同志们的互相激励下，更忘我地工作，自己有病身上发烧还输了二百西西的血给两个垂死的伤员。他们恢复健康以后，看见刘秀珍的瘦弱样子，感动万分，要院部给她记功。有一次汽车送来许多冻伤伤员，她和护士长一同接，一晚上背了四十多人，把他们一个个放在半里外的分散的民房里，后来司机同志也来帮忙，他们一宵完成了任务。刘秀珍常向劝她休息的人说：死我一个没关系啊，救活他们一个，好多打几个敌人。别忘记我们在毛主席像前的宣誓！
    五六月里朝鲜雨水多，可是今年九月在西线也发了大水。有一天夜里刘秀珍知道要闹水灾时，她马上通知了连部，同时准备迁移，外科病房正在低地，得往高地背伤员，他们把一百多重伤伤员全救出来，放到防空洞里，把门堵上。上头浇着大雨，下面水泡过膝盖，轻伤伤员和护理工作人员全上了树，力气大的还替朝鲜老百姓抱着小孩。女同志有的松了手摔了下去，又被同志们拉上来。大家在树上站了十一二小时。刘秀珍在树上时还向大家说：
    “困难是一时的，胜利却是永久的，要坚定克服！”
    刘秀珍对许多同志的模范事迹记得很清楚，例如顶了石板冒火去救伤员的李医生，用身体遮住伤员，怕飞机扫射他们的杨志敏……“我们都是平凡的人，但是正受着不平凡的考验。作为一个共产党员，就得不向困难低头。我要向周围这些同志学习！”她在日记上这样写着。
                （三）
    等到脚踩着了祖国的土地，一个个战士都兴奋极了。一江之隔，却是两个世界，没有被战争的火焰燃烧着的地方，人们生活得多么幸福啊！在农田里，是金黄色的庄稼，正是收获季节；在工厂区，机器的轰响代替了飞机大炮的声音。孩子们背了书包去上学，嘴里唱着抗美援朝歌曲。城市里的公共汽车和电车那么繁忙，秩序却很好。
    回到祖国来受到人民热烈的欢迎，刘秀珍怎么想也觉得过意不去。“我给祖国人民作了什么呢？真惭愧！”轮到她发言或作报告时，她总是忘不了这两句话。她还感谢祖国人民的建设，使得建立才两年的祖国就这样体面，人民有吃有穿，工厂里的机器越来越棒。在东北参观时，刘秀珍倾听工人同志们的解说，为他们的新纪录祝贺。许多老大爷老大娘当了模范，孩子们的觉悟程度和学习情绪那么高，把个刘秀珍乐得了不的，她见了人总说：祖国人民的功劳大呀，我们在朝鲜吃点苦受点累，不算什么。
    到了北京车站上，受到首都人民热烈欢迎，刘秀珍压跟儿脚没着地，被欢迎群众抬着出了车站。“怎么得了，我们成了香饽饽啦，快把祖国人民对咱们的热爱告诉在朝鲜的同志们，咱们得对得起祖国人民。”她在旅舍里和同伴说，也就连夜给在朝鲜的同伴写信。刘秀珍是参加部队后才开始学文化的，平日记笔记的本领自己也不能满意，但是这回一写信，竟有写不完的话。
    可纪念的九月三十日。这一晚毛主席在怀仁堂宴请功臣和贵宾。刘秀珍的座位离主席太远，她个子又不高，尽是回头看，也不动筷子。她们三位志愿军女同志过去给毛主席敬酒，毛主席双手和她们拉手，笑着说：“你们辛苦了！”
    三位女同志只是笑，只说了“祝主席健康”，准备好了的很多其他的话全丢到九霄云外。回到旅舍，大家兴奋得睡不好觉。
    “这幸福是谁给的呢，能见到毛主席，得到他的赞誉？”刘秀珍躺在枕头上想着。刘秀珍从两三年来的学习中也粗粗了解了一下中国人民百多年来的苦难，只觉得自己这年轻一代真是幸运，对于党对于毛主席充满了感谢。
