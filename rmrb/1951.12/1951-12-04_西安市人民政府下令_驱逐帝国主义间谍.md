    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 3rd: The Xi'an Municipal People's Government issued an order last month to permanently expel from Chinese territory two imperialist spies who had been lurking in the city: Italian nationals Corrado Costa (Acting Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Xi'an) and Biànběn Ghidini (Catholic Priest). The Xi'an Municipal People's Government also ordered three Italian nationals who, under the instruction of Costa and Ghidini, engaged in reactionary propaganda, spread rumors, and slandered our national laws, namely, Jia Boji (Catholic Priest), Ji Anle (former Director of the Anduo Hospital in Xi'an), and An Feiyue (Catholic Nun), to leave China within a specified period.

    The two spy elements, Costa and Ghidini, established organizational ties with American spies as early as 1944, collecting intelligence for imperialism. After the liberation of Xi'an, Costa and Ghidini, under the instruction of Wan Jiulou (former Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Xi'an, who has fled back to Italy), secretly set up a radio station to continue probing for our military, political, economic, and other intelligence, and secretly hid weapons and ammunition; harbored Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret agent Wang Yaoxian, and others; printed and distributed reactionary books and periodicals, undermining the patriotic movement of the Chinese people. In addition, the criminals also stole a large number of our ancient cultural relics.

    The crimes of Costa, Ghidini, and others were exposed by patriotic Catholics in Xi'an. After investigation and verification by the Public Security Bureau of the Municipal People's Government, they were arrested on June 12th. On the same day, 281 dismantled and hidden radio parts, 109 intelligence photographs, more than 200 pieces of ancient artifacts from the Zhou Dynasty and later dynasties, a quantity of weapons and ammunition, and many letters between Costa, Ghidini, Wan Jiulou, and others were found in their residences. These objects further proved the criminal facts of Costa and Ghidini. Faced with such ironclad evidence, Costa and Ghidini could not deny and confessed to their above-mentioned crimes.

    People from all walks of life in Xi'an and patriotic Catholics were delighted to hear of the arrest of Costa and Ghidini and demanded that the People's Government handle the matter according to law. In order to protect national security and the interests of the people, the Xi'an Municipal People's Government issued an order last month to permanently expel the two criminals from our country and has already carried it out. The Xi'an Municipal People's Government also ordered the accomplices Jia Boji, Ji Anle, An Feiyue, and others to leave China within a specified period.

    西安市人民政府下令
    驱逐帝国主义间谍
     【新华社西安三日电】西安市人民政府已于上月下令将潜伏在该市的帝国主义间谍分子、意大利籍侨民葛露膏（天主教西安总主教区代理主教）、边寄宁（天主教神甫）两犯永远驱逐出中国国境。西安市人民政府同时命令在葛、边两犯指使下进行反动宣传、散布谣言、诬蔑我国国家法令的意大利籍侨民佳伯济（天主教神甫）、吉安乐（前西安市安多医院院长）、安飞跃（天主教修女）三人限期离开我国国境。
    葛露膏和边寄宁两间谍分子，自一九四四年起即与美国间谍建立了组织关系；为帝国主义搜集情报。西安市解放后，葛、边两犯在前天主教西安总主教区主教万九楼（已逃回意大利）指示下，私设电台，继续刺探我国军事、政治、经济等各种情报，并暗藏武器弹药；窝藏蒋匪特务分子王耀先等；印刷和散布反动书刊，破坏中国人民的爱国运动。此外，该犯等还曾经盗窃了大批我国的古代文物。
    葛、边等犯的罪行，是由西安市爱国天主教徒揭发出来的，市人民政府公安局在经过调查属实后，于六月十二日加以逮捕，同日在他们的住宅搜查出拆散分藏着的电台机件二百八十一件、情报照片一百零九张、周朝以后的历代古物二百多件、武器弹药一部以及葛、边两犯和万九楼等来往信函多件。这些物件更加证明了葛、边两犯的犯罪事实。在这样的铁证面前，葛、边两犯无从狡辩，供认了他们的上述罪行。
    西安市各界人民和爱国天主教徒听到葛、边两犯被捕后，一致称快，并要求人民政府依法处理。西安市人民政府为了保护国家安全和人民利益，于上月下令将该两犯永远驱逐出我国国境，并已执行。西安市人民政府同时命令从犯佳伯济、吉安乐、安飞跃等三人限期离开中国国境。
