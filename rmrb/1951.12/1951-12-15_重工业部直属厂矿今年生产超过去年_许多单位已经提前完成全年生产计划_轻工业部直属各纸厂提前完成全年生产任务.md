    The production level of factories and mines directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government this year will greatly surpass that of last year. To date, many factories and mines have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. The time ahead of schedule: Qixin Magnetic Material Factory is 63 days, Tianjin Steel Plant's steel is 52 days, Liulihe Cement Plant is 38 days, Shijiazhuang Coking Plant and Tangshan Steel Plant are also more than one month ahead of schedule. According to the trend of gradual increase in production of various factories and mines from January to October, it is estimated that by the end of the year, the actual production performance of all directly affiliated factories and mines throughout the year will greatly exceed the production performance of 1950, calculated as: iron ore increased by 59 percent, coke increased by 60 percent, pig iron increased by 106 percent, steel increased by 65 percent, cement increased by 6 percent, flat glass increased by 100 percent, caustic soda increased by 34 percent, and vulcanized green increased by 29 percent.
    Since the beginning of this year, the workers and staff of various directly affiliated factories and mines have created many new production records. The electric furnace steelmaking of a certain steel plant created a new record of 150 tons per day. A certain coking plant increased from the original 128 tons per day to 162 tons per day. The life of the furnace top of Tianjin Steel Plant was extended to 276 furnaces. Thanks to the workers' active improvement of technology, many new products have emerged in various factories and mines this year. For example, Taiyuan Machinery Factory manufactured coal cutters, Tianjin Machinery Factory manufactured 9-cubic-meter mobile air compressors, Beijing Machinery Factory manufactured herringbone gear hobbing machines, Tianjin Automobile Assembly Plant manufactured cars, etc.
    The labor productivity of various directly affiliated factories and mines has also increased significantly this year. The labor productivity of Liulihe Cement Plant in the third quarter increased by 30.7 percent compared with the first quarter. The labor productivity of Tianjin Dye Factory and Tianjin Bicycle Factory has also increased by 4 to 13 percent. Due to the increase in labor productivity and the reduction in material consumption, the costs of some factories and mines have also been greatly reduced. For example, the factory cost of sodium sulfide in Tianjin Chemical Plant and Tianjin Dye Factory was reduced by 30 percent. The cost reduction of Liulihe Cement Plant has played a leading role in the national cement industry. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Xinhua News Agency: All directly subordinate paper mills under the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government also completed their annual production tasks 35 days ahead of schedule on November 26th, exceeding the quota by 0.33 percent. This is the result of the unprecedented improvement of the political consciousness of the workers and staff of various factories after a series of movements such as making up for the democratic reform, conducting major inspections of technology and safety, and launching patriotic labor competitions. In the process of completing the annual production tasks ahead of schedule, many labor models have emerged in various factories. Tianjin Paper Mill selected 33 labor models in ten months. The workers and staff of various factories have put forward many rationalization proposals, improved technology, and improved labor productivity. The workers and staff of Tianjin Paper Mill put forward 230 rationalization proposals in ten months, of which 130 were adopted and effective. The equipment utilization rate of various factories has increased month by month, and the paper loss rate and various consumptions have also decreased month by month. For example, the equipment utilization rate of each paper machine in Tianjin Paper Mill in October increased by an average of 20 to 30 percent compared with January; the paper loss rate of No. 4 machine decreased from 22.7 percent in January to less than 8 percent in October; the power consumption per ton of glazed paper in October also decreased by 34 percent compared with January. The power consumption for manufacturing each ton of cigarette paper in Shandong Paper Mill decreased by 50 percent, and coal decreased by 25 percent. The coal consumption per ton of newsprint in Xuanhua Paper Mill also decreased by 25 percent. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重工业部直属厂矿今年生产超过去年
    许多单位已经提前完成全年生产计划
    轻工业部直属各纸厂提前完成全年生产任务
    中央人民政府重工业部直属厂矿今年的生产水平将大大超过去年。到目前为止，已有许多厂矿提前完成了全年生产计划。提前完成的时间：启新磁厂是六十三天，天津钢厂的钢材是五十二天，琉璃河水泥厂是三十八天，石家庄炼焦厂和唐山钢厂也提前一个月以上。根据一月到十月各厂矿生产逐渐提高的趋势，预计到年底止，各直属厂矿今年全年的生产实绩将大大超过一九五零年的生产实绩，计：铁矿增加百分之五十九，焦炭增加百分之六十，生铁增加百分之一百零六，钢材增加百分之六十五，水泥增加百分之六，平板玻璃增加百分之百，烧碱增加百分之三十四，硫化青增加百分之二十九。
    今年以来，各直属厂矿的职工们曾经创造了很多新的生产纪录。某钢厂电炉炼钢创造了日产一百五十吨的新纪录。某炼焦厂由原来日产一百二十八吨提高到日产一百六十二吨。天津钢厂炉顶寿命延续到二百七十六炉。由于职工们积极改进技术，各厂矿今年以来出现了很多新的产品。例如太原机器厂制造了割煤机，天津机器厂制造了九立方公尺的移动空气压缩机，北京机器厂制造了人字牙轮铡齿机，天津汽车制配厂制造了小汽车等等。
    各直属厂矿的劳动生产率今年以来也有显著的提高。琉璃河水泥厂劳动生产率第三季就比第一季提高了百分之三十点七。天津染料厂、天津自行车厂的劳动生产率也提高了百分之四到百分之十三。由于劳动生产率的提高和材料消耗的降低，有些厂矿的成本也大大降低了。例如天津化工厂和天津染料厂的硫化碱，厂成本就降低了百分之三十。琉璃河水泥厂成本的降低，在全国水泥工业中更起了带头作用。　（新华社）
    中央人民政府轻工业部各直属纸厂也提前三十五天在十一月二十六日超额百分之零点三三完成全年生产任务。这是各厂工人职员经过民主改革补课、技术保安大检查、爱国主义劳动竞赛等一系列运动后，政治觉悟空前提高的结果。在提前完成全年生产任务过程中，各厂都涌现出不少劳动模范。天津造纸总厂在十个月中就评选出劳动模范三十三名。各厂工人职员都提出许多合理化建议，改进了技术，提高了劳动生产率。天津造纸总厂工人职员在十个月中提出的合理化建议就有二百三十件，其中被采纳并行之有效的有一百三十件。各厂的设备利用率都逐月提高，损纸率和各种消耗也逐月降低。如天津造纸总厂各纸机十月份的设备利用率较一月份平均提高了百分之二十到三十；四号机的损纸率由一月份的百分之二十二点七降低到十月份的百分之八以下；十月份每吨有光纸的用电量也较一月份减低百分之三十四。山东造纸分厂制造每吨卷烟纸的用电量减少了百分之五十，煤减少了百分之二十五。宣化纸厂每吨新闻纸用煤量也减少了百分之二十五。　（新华社）
