    Su Bei Water Conservancy Bureau Improves Sluice Gate Design
    Saving Large Amounts of Equipment and Labor
    Saving 15 Million Catties of Rice

    The Su Bei Water Conservancy Bureau has adopted advanced Soviet experience and improved the design work in the sluice gate construction projects this winter and next spring, which can save about 15 million catties of rice. In the 1952 Su Bei water conservancy projects, it is planned to build the Gaoliangjian intake sluice on the Su Bei Irrigation Main Canal project, the Huai'an Yun Dong diversion sluice, and the Luoma Lake spillway sluice, the Zaohe control sluice, and the Xi Chao River tide barrier sluice in the Dao Yi project. According to past experience, foundation piles must be driven first when building sluice gates. The original design of the five sluice gates all adopted plug-in gates, and about 6,000 foundation piles had to be driven. The Su Bei Water Conservancy Bureau adopted the advanced Soviet experience of building sluice gates without driving foundation piles. After a month of research by 28 engineering personnel, it finally completed the design of building sluice gates without foundation piles, and the gates of all five sluice gates were also changed to flap gates. This change in engineering design can save a large amount of equipment and labor for the entire sluice gate construction project. The elimination of foundation piles alone can save 6 million catties of rice and 90,000 man-days of labor. The improvement of the gates can also save a lot of equipment and transportation capacity, totaling 15 million catties of rice, which is equivalent to the value of about ten fighter planes. Moreover, because the time-consuming piling work in the project is eliminated, the project can be completed two months earlier than originally planned, and the quality of the project is more solid than the project using foundation piles.

    苏北水利局改进水闸设计
    节省大量器材人工
    可节约大米一千五百万斤
    苏北水利局接受苏联先进经验，改进今冬明春建闸工程中的设计工作，约可节省大米一千五百万斤。一九五二年的苏北水利工程中，计划建造苏北灌溉总渠工程上的高良涧进水闸、淮安运东分水闸和导沂工程中的骆马湖泄水闸、皂河节制闸、西潮河挡潮闸。依照过去的经验，建闸时必须先打基桩。五个闸原来设计都采用插式闸门，并须打基桩约六千根。苏北水利局接受苏联建闸可以不打基桩的先进经验，经二十八个工程人员一个月的研究，终于完成了不用基桩建闸的设计，五个闸的闸门也全部改用幅式闸门。这一工程设计的改变，使全部建闸工程可节省大批器材和人工。仅不打基桩一项，即可省六百万斤大米和九万个人工，闸门的改进也可以节省不少器材和运输力，共计可以节省大米一千五百万斤，约等于十架战斗机的价值。又因为省去了工程中最费时间的打桩工作，所以工程可比原计划提早两个月完工，而且工程质量比用基桩的工程还要牢固。（程德全）
