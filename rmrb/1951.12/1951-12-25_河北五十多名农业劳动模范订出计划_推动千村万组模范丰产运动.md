    More Than 50 Agricultural Labor Models in Hebei Province Set Out Plans to Promote a Thousand Villages and Ten Thousand Teams Model Bumper Harvest Campaign

    Agricultural labor models in various parts of Hebei Province have successively formulated patriotic production increase plans, actively launching a thousand villages and ten thousand teams model bumper harvest campaign. This campaign was initiated by labor models Geng Changsuo, Zhang Xishun, Song Luoxue, and others at the Second Hebei Provincial Congress of Labor Models in Industry and Agriculture held in mid-November. They requested that next year, one thousand model production households should be developed throughout the province, and these households should achieve a yield of more than 400 jin per mu for cotton and wheat, more than 600 jin per mu for millet, more than 500 jin per mu for corn, and more than 6,000 jin per mu for sweet potatoes. Efforts should be made to develop ten thousand model bumper harvest mutual aid teams; these teams should increase the yield per unit area by 30 percent based on this year's bumper harvest. One thousand model bumper harvest villages should be developed, and these villages should increase the yield per unit area by 20 to 25 percent compared to this year. Each county should have a model bumper harvest area, and this area should increase the yield per unit area by 15 to 20 percent compared to this year. Each special district should have a model bumper harvest county, requiring the county to increase the yield per unit area by 10 to 15 percent. This proposal was warmly welcomed by all agricultural labor model representatives and cadres attending the conference and has been supported and guided by the leading organs of Hebei Province. Currently, the labor models participating in this movement have put forward specific goals in their production increase plans to improve the yield per unit area and drive farmers to increase production. Labor model Geng Changsuo of Wugong Village, Raoyang County, plans to increase grain production by 17,000 jin next year (this year's total grain production was 111,180 jin). In the 16 mu of high-yield experimental fields, 5 mu of cotton will produce 650 jin per mu, 5 mu of corn will produce 800 jin per mu, 5 mu of millet will produce 1,000 jin per mu, and 1 mu of sweet potatoes will produce 8,000 jin; the general cotton fields of 35 mu will produce 250 jin of seed cotton per mu; other general crop farmland will strive to produce 540 jin of grain per mu, exceeding this year by 30 jin. Zhang Defang, a labor model from Feixiang County who created a new record for cotton production in Hebei Province, wants to increase his yield from 725 jin of seed cotton per mu this year to 1,000 jin, and also wants to drive the ten households in his mutual aid team to produce 600 jin per mu, and also help farmers in five nearby villages to improve cotton planting techniques. Zou Yubin, a bumper harvest model in the Xiaozhan rice producing area of Tianjin, in addition to ensuring that his 10 mu of paddy fields produce 1,500 jin of rice per mu, will also drive three mutual aid teams to become "thousand-jin teams." Guo Yucheng, a labor model of an agricultural production cooperative in Boye County, plans to increase the yield per unit area of various crops by 15 percent next year, and cotton, millet, and sweet potatoes will increase even more. Yu Laoshan, a labor model from Ji County, plans to lead 137 households in the village to increase production by 20 percent, and is also preparing to assist the local people's government to lead farmers in the entire district to increase the yield per unit area by 15 percent and create a model bumper harvest area. Wu Xuezeng, a labor model from Sandi Village, Wangdu County, wants to drive mutual aid teams in the village to increase production by 35 percent, and the entire village by 30 percent. Song Luoxue, Wang Qingmei, Zhang Luoting, Zhengsheng, Wang Luoren and others, labor models from Mancheng County, all proposed in their plans to guarantee to help the village government lead the farmers in the village to increase production by 20 to 30 percent, and strive to make the village a model bumper harvest village. Song Luoxue, Wang Qingmei, and Zhang Luoting also want to help the district people's government lead the farmers in the entire district to increase cotton and grain production by 15 to 20 percent compared to this year. The five of them also plan to mobilize 900 households to participate in the "Thousand Villages and Ten Thousand Teams Model Bumper Harvest Campaign." Liu Chunfa, a labor model in mountainous agriculture, strives to produce 800 jin of corn per mu on 5 mu, and 500 jin of millet per mu on 2 mu, and also guarantees to drive the entire village to increase production by 20 percent next year, and launch a bumper harvest campaign for 30 households to increase corn production to 500 jin per mu. In addition, Liang Jiarui, a model for cotton planting in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Jiang Yu, a model for water conservancy in Wuqing County, Gao Guandou, a model for soil improvement in Shen County, and Yan Jifang and Li Jun of Changli County, Yue Fengxian of Daming County, Nie Zhijian of Tang County, Dong Yuming of Xiazhen County, An Qingjie of Pingshan County, Niu Baodan and Dong Ruiquan of Yuanshi County, Wang Jun of Ji County, Wang Dekui of Dingxing County, Zhang Yupu of Ding County, and more than 50 other labor models have all formulated specific production increase plans. Many agricultural labor models have also led farmers in the entire village and team to formulate bumper harvest plans.

    Guaranteeing increased unit area yields through organizing, improving techniques, massively accumulating fertilizer, and expanding paddy fields
        
    All labor models have proposed to guarantee the realization of production increase plans by organizing, improving techniques, applying large amounts of fertilizer, and expanding paddy fields. In terms of organizing, Geng Changsuo is preparing to expand the agricultural production cooperative and absorb some farmers who want to join the cooperative; Zou Yubin wants to help the 12 temporary mutual aid teams in his village develop into year-round mutual aid teams, and organize the old, the young, and women half-laborers; Song Luoxue and others want to mobilize 80 percent of the labor force in their village to participate in mutual aid teams, and strive to organize 40 percent of the female labor force (currently, 60 to 70 percent of the labor force in their village has participated in mutual aid teams, of which 30 percent are female labor force); Niu Baodan wants to lead the farmers in the entire village to participate in mutual aid teams, and currently 80 of the 101 households in his village have participated in mutual aid teams; Wu Xuezeng wants to lead 50 percent of the labor force in the entire village to organize, and enable 20 percent of the households to achieve long-term mutual aid. In terms of improving technology, labor models have put forward various methods based on their specific conditions. For example, Geng Changsuo plans to buy a 10-inch walking plow, a four-row seeder, and a new-style weeding hoe each next year (there are already one 7-inch and one 10-inch walking plow), so that new-style farm implements are used for both plowing and planting, and he also plans to purchase two sprayers (there is already one), 60 jin of "666" and rotenone powder and other insecticides to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Gao Guandou is preparing to help nearby villages transform 1,800 mu of alkaline land. Wu Xuezeng wants to lead the entire village to prepare 2,000 jin of pesticides and increase 10 7-inch walking plows. All labor models are prepared to select excellent varieties, adopt new-style farm implements, and improve farming methods. For example, Zou Yubin and Zhang Defang are prepared to achieve appropriate dense planting of rice and cotton. Zhang Defang left 2,200 cotton seedlings per mu this year and harvested 725 jin of cotton; he is preparing to leave 3,000 seedlings per mu next year and strive to achieve a bumper harvest of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. In terms of fertilization, Geng Changsuo plans to increase fertilizer application by one time compared to this year, and use methods such as expanding pig pens and pressing green manure to accumulate 1.4 million jin of fertilizer, and then buy 200 jin of fertilizer powder to apply topdressing three times to various crops. Yue Fengxian plans to open an oil mill and earn 15,000 jin of oil cake to apply to the fields. Li Jun's mutual aid team plans to raise 10 large pigs together this winter, and each household will raise 104 pigs, plus the manure of 13 livestock and the oil cake and flour residue earned by opening an oil mill and flour mill, a total of 1,900 large carts of fertilizer can be accumulated, and 3,000 jin of base fertilizer can be applied to each mu of land next spring. In terms of expanding paddy fields, Geng Changsuo is preparing to repair an old well, dig a new well, buy two waterwheels, and increase the water area by 25 mu. Wu Xuezeng guarantees that the entire village will dig 45 new wells next year, increase 40 waterwheels, and strive to expand the paddy fields by 1,500 mu. Nie Zhijian of Tang County wants to lead the farmers in the entire village to dig 10 new wells and buy 30 waterwheels on the basis of existing water conservancy facilities, and turn all dry land into paddy fields.

    Making preparations for next year's bumper harvest from the winter production increase and thrift campaign

    Labor models plan to make preparations for next year's great production in this year's winter production increase and thrift campaign. For example, Liu Chunfa wants to organize 132 people to go up the mountain to collect 900,000 jin of firewood to support next year's production; the land of Guo Yucheng's mutual aid team is alkaline, and this winter they decided that the rubber-tired carts in the team will not go out to pull loads, but will pull sand at home to pad the ground and change the soil quality; in addition to leading every household to raise pigs and make compost this winter, Zou Yubin also wants to transport rice straw out to sell and earn money to buy more fertilizer powder; Zhang Defang's mutual aid team will cultivate the land twice, harrow it five times, and hoe it twice before the ground freezes this winter to maintain moisture.

    When formulating production increase plans, labor models also formulated or revised patriotic pacts, and they are prepared to use the concrete actions of implementing patriotic pacts to ensure the smooth realization of production increase plans. (Comprehensive report by this newspaper)

    河北五十多名农业劳动模范订出计划
    推动千村万组模范丰产运动
    河北省各地农业劳动模范纷纷订出爱国增产计划，积极开展千村万组模范丰产运动。这一运动是劳动模范耿长锁、张希顺、宋洛学等在河北省十一月中旬召开的全省第二届工农业劳动模范代表大会上发动的。他们要求明年在全省范围内发展一千个模范生产户，这些户要作到每亩棉花、小麦产四百斤以上，谷子产六百斤以上，玉米产五百斤以上、甘薯产六千斤以上。争取发展一万个模范丰产互助组；这些组要在今年的丰产基础上提高单位面积产量百分之三十。发展一千个模范丰产村，这些村要做到全村的单位面积产量比今年提高百分之二十到二十五。每个县要有一个模范丰产区，这个区要做到全区单位面积产量比今年提高百分之十五到二十。每个专区要有一个模范丰产县，要求这个县提高单位面积产量百分之十到十五。这一提议，得到参加大会的全体农业劳动模范代表和干部的热烈响应，并已得到河北省领导机关的支持和领导。现在，参加这个运动的劳动模范都在自己的增产计划中提出了提高单位面积产量和带动农民增产的具体奋斗目标。饶阳县五公村劳动模范耿长锁计划明年增产粮食一万七千斤（今年共产粮十一万一千一百八十斤）。在十六亩丰产实验地中，五亩棉花每亩产六百五十斤，五亩玉米每亩产八百斤，五亩谷子每亩产一千斤，一亩甘薯产八千斤；一般棉田三十五亩，每亩产籽棉二百五十斤；其他一般作物农田，每亩争取产粮五百四十斤，超过今年三十斤。创河北省棉花丰产新纪录的肥乡县劳动模范张德芳，要在今年每亩产籽棉七百二十五斤的基础上，提高到
    一千斤，并且要带动自己互助组内的十户，每亩产六百斤，还要帮助附近五个村的农民提高植棉技术。天津小站稻产区丰产模范邹玉彬，除保证他的十亩水田每亩产稻谷一千五百斤外，还要带动三个互助组或为“千斤组”。博野县农业生产合作社劳动模范郭玉琛计划明年把各样庄稼提高单位面积产量百分之十五，棉花、谷子、甘薯要增产更多。冀县劳动模范郁老善计划带动全村一百三十七户农民，增产百分之二十，还准备协助本区人民政府，带动全区农民，提高单位面积产量百分之十五，创造模范丰产区。望都县三堤村劳动模范吴学增要带动全村互助组提高产量百分之三十五，全村提高百分之

    从组织起来、提高技术、大量
    积肥、扩大水田等方面保证
        提高单位面积产量
    各劳动模范都提出要从组织起来、提高技术、大量施肥、扩大水田等方面来保证实现增产计划。在组织起来方面，耿长锁准备扩大农业生产合作社，吸收一部分要求入社的农民入社；邹玉彬要帮助本村十二个临时互助组发展成常年互助组，把老的少的和妇女半劳力都组织起来；宋洛学等五人要发动本村百分之八十的劳动力参加互助组，争取妇女劳动力百分之四十组织起来（现在他们的村已有百分之六十到七十的劳动力参加了互助组，其中有百分之三十的女劳动力）；牛保单要带动全村农民参加互助组，现在他的村一百零一户中已有八十户参加了互助组；吴学增要带动全村百分之五十的劳动力组织起来，并使百分之二十的户达到长期互助。在提高技术方面，各劳动模范都根据自己的具体条件，提出了各种办法。如耿长锁计划明年买十吋步犁、四行播种机、新式耘锄各一架（原有七吋，十吋步犁各一架），做到耕、耩地都用新式农具，还准备添购喷雾器两架（原有一架）、“六六六”和鱼藤粉等杀虫药剂六十斤，以防治病虫害。高贯斗准备帮助附近村庄改造碱地一千八百亩。吴学增要带动全村准备好农药二千斤，增加七吋步犁十架。所有劳动模范都准备选用优良品种，采用新式农具，改进耕作方法。如邹玉彬、张德芳准备做到稻、棉适当密植。张德芳今年的棉苗每亩留二千二百棵，收棉七百二十五斤；他准备明年每亩留三千棵，争取每亩丰产籽棉一千斤。在施肥方面，耿长锁计划明年施肥比今年增加一倍，用扩大猪圈，压绿肥等办法积肥一百四十万斤，再买二百斤肥田粉，作到各种庄稼普施追肥三次。岳凤仙计划开油房，赚油饼一万五千斤，都上到地里。李俊互助组计划今冬伙养大猪十只，各户再养猪一百零四只，加上十三头牲口的粪和开油房粉房赚下的油饼粉渣，一共可以积肥料一千九百大车，明春每亩地可施底肥三千斤。在扩大水田方面，耿长锁准备修旧井一眼，打新井一眼，买水车两辆，增加水地二十五亩。吴学增保证明年全村打新井四十五眼，增加水车四十辆，争取扩大水田一千五百亩。唐县聂志建要带动全村农民在现有水利基础上增打新井十眼，买水车三十辆，把旱地全变成水田。
    从冬季增产节约运动中做好明
        年丰产的准备工作
    劳动模范们都计划在今年冬季的增产节约运动中，做好明年大生产的准备工作。如刘春发要组织一百三十二人上山打柴九十万斤，支持明年生产；郭玉琛互助组的地带碱性，今冬他们决定组内的胶皮车不出去拉脚，在家拉沙子垫地，改变土质；邹玉彬今冬除带动家家养猪，制造堆肥外，还要把稻草运出去卖，赚回钱多买肥田粉；张德芳互助组要在今冬地冻前耕地二遍，耙五遍，耪两遍，以保持水分。
    劳动模范们在制订增产计划的时候，同时制订或修订了爱国公约，他们准备用执行爱国公约的具体行动来保证增产计划的顺利实现。（本报综合稿）
