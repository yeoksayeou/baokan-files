The Tianjin Railway Administration has been conducting in-depth inspections since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign. Recently, serious waste has been discovered in the operation of locomotives and rolling stock.

First, there is waste in the use of rolling stock. According to the operational indicators for the first five days of November, on average, only 44% of the bureau's rolling stock was running on the lines each day, while the number of car-hours spent in stations (the time each car spent in the station) accounted for 56%. The irrational use of rolling stock prevents the full satisfaction of the transportation requirements of major cargo owners. In early November, the bureau only completed 82% of its planned transportation, with a backlog of as many as 2,062 carloads of major goods. It only began to catch up in mid-November. However, due to poor management of unloading operations, serious congestion occurred at Tianjin Station. Goods could not be unloaded or loaded, which affected the turnover of rolling stock and reduced the efficiency of rolling stock utilization.

Second, there is waste in the use of locomotives. First, there is excessive single-engine operation (locomotives running empty, without pulling freight cars). According to the Locomotive Department's statistics, the annual locomotive running task had been completed by October 27, but single-engine running accounted for 620,000 kilometers, equivalent to 1,672 locomotives. Apart from the necessary single-engine runs within the plan, most of it was waste. This situation did not improve in the first half of November. In twenty days, single engines ran 413 times, of which 44% was completely wasted. Hauling less than full axle load is the second manifestation of wasting locomotives. In the first half of November, trains on major lines running with less than full axle load accounted for 47.7% of the total number of trains. (This is calculated according to the standard set by the Tianjin Railway Administration itself. For example, the Ministry stipulates that each train on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan line should pull 43 cars, but the bureau set it at 53 cars, a higher standard than stipulated by the Ministry.) In other words, the capacity of nearly half of the locomotives was not fully utilized.

The reasons for the waste of transport capacity are as follows: First, the daily transport plans are unrealistic, and the bureaucratic work attitude of some transport personnel seriously affects the realization of planned transport. Some scheduling personnel did not promptly understand the loading situation at the stations and had insufficient contact with the stations, so the plans often fell through. In the first half of November, a total of one-sixth of the trains had their plans temporarily changed, disrupting the transport order. After the plan is formulated, the execution and inspection are also not strict. Tianjin Station recently spent less than a day inspecting the east freight yard and found 45 cars that had not been discharged in time, wasting 1,043 car-hours. If each car-hour is calculated according to the September income of 34,000 yuan, the 45 cars wasted more than 35 million yuan in total. Second, some transport workers have departmentalism in the competition. For example, some transport workers, in order to load more cars themselves, did not send empty cars to other branch bureaus, hindering the completion of the transport tasks of other branch bureaus. In particular, the delivery of cars is unbalanced. They try their best to dispatch cars before 18:00 (the railway stipulates that 18:00 [6:00 PM] is the time for daily settlement of transport achievements), and there are no cars after 18:00. They only know how to strive for their own achievements in shortening the turnover rate and the punctuality of trains today, regardless of the difficulties of others. For example, on October 28, trains from Fengtai to Tianjin caused three single-engine runs because 40% of the trains departed between 12:00 and 18:00. This unbalanced transport, in turn, increased the confusion in the execution of the transport plan. Third, the time of trains entering the pass from the Northeast is abnormal. For example, on November 26 and 28, four fewer trains arrived each day, and locomotives went but had no cars to pull; or even if the plan could be completed, the dispatch was tight before and loose after. On October 24, a total of ten trains entered the pass. No cars arrived in the six hours from 18:00 to 24:00, and one train arrived before 6:00. However, six trains were dispatched together in the two and a half hours from 15:30 to 18:00, and the last train only departed from Shanhaiguan marshalling yard at 17:59. This kind of "herding sheep" driving happens frequently and should be studied and resolved by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. Fourth, the cargo owners of dedicated lines and dedicated railways do not pay attention to the loading and unloading and delivery time of vehicles.

In order to overcome the waste of transport capacity, the Tianjin Railway Administration has issued a decision instructing the entire railway to strengthen transport management and save locomotives and rolling stock. The specific measures are: (1) Correctly implement the daily transport plan and strictly enforce scheduling discipline; each branch bureau and boundary station can refuse to accept cars from another bureau if the other bureau does not send cars according to plan without special reasons. If a branch bureau overloads cars due to failure to complete the car dispatch task according to plan, the excess part will be allocated to the branch bureau that suffered the loss as compensation. The regulations concerning the boundary stations between the relevant administrations shall be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for resolution. (2) It is stipulated that all locomotives must, in principle, run with full axle load, and implement super-axle on the basis of safety. If it is impossible to run with full axle load for special reasons, it must be approved by the branch bureau chief or the administration director. (3) Investigate and reorganize dedicated lines and master the loading and unloading operations of dedicated lines. (4) Strengthen the connection between the train formation station and the rolling stock section, sign a station-section contact contract, establish a loss compensation system, and ensure timely delivery of cars.

    天津铁路管理局深入检查工作
    发现机车车辆运用上的严重浪费现象
    现已决定加强运输管理厉行节约
    天津铁路管理局自开展增产节约运动以来，就深入检查工作。最近，在机车、车辆的运用上，发现了严重的浪费现象。
    首先是车辆运用上的浪费。根据十一月最初五天计划作业指标计算，全局车辆平均每天只有百分之四十四的时间在线路上运行，在站上停留的车小时（每辆车在站上的停留时间），就占百分之五十六。车辆运用不合理，就不能充分满足主要货主的运输要求。十一月上旬，该局计划内运输只完成百分之八十二，主要货物运输积欠达二千零六十二车之多，中旬才开始赶运。但因对卸车工作掌握得不好，曾造成天津站的严重堵塞现象。货物既卸不下来，也装不上，这样就又影响车辆的运转，减低了车辆运用效能。
    其次，是机车运用上的浪费。首先，表现在单机走行（机车空跑，不拉货车）过多。据机务处统计，全年机车走行任务到十月二十七日已经完成，但其中单机走行达六十二万公里，折合一千六百七十二台机车。除去在计划内的必须空跑的单机以外，大部分是浪费的。这种情况到十一月上中旬还没好转，二十天内单机已跑了四百十三次，其中有百分之四十四完全是浪费的。牵引不满轴，是浪费机车的第二种表现。十一月份上中旬主要线路运输不满轴的列车占总列车次数的百分之四十七点七。（这是按天津铁路管理局自订的标准计算。如京山线部定每列拉四十三个车，该局订为五十三个车，标准较部定为高。）也就是说近半数机车的能力没有充分发挥。
    运输力浪费的原因有下面几个：一、每天运输计划不切实际，某些运输工作人员的官僚主义工作态度严重地影响了计划运输的实现。有些调度工作人员没有及时了解车站装车情况，和车站联系不够，计划常常落空。十一月上中旬总计有六分之一的列车临时变更计划，运输秩序也因而打乱。在计划制订之后，执行和检查也很不严格。天津站最近花了不到一天的时间，在东货场就检查出四十五辆车没有及时排出，浪费了一千零四十三个车小时。每个车小时如按九月份的收入额三万四千元计算，四十五辆车共浪费三千五百多万元。二、有些运输工作人员在竞赛中有本位主义思想。如有些运输工作人员为了自己多装车，不给别的分局送空车，妨碍其他分局运输任务的完成。特别是送车不平衡，十八点（铁路上规定十八点钟〔下午六点钟〕为每天结算运输成绩的时间）以前拚命排车，十八点以后没有车，只知争取自己今天缩短运转率和列车正点的成绩，不管别人困难。如十月二十八日丰台到天津间列车就因为有百分之四十的列车在十二点至十八点时发出，就造成三次放单机。这种不平衡的运输又反转过来增加了运输计划执行上的混乱。三、东北进关列车时间不正常。如十一月二十六日、二十八日每天少来了四列，机车去了没车拉；或者虽能完成计划，而发车前松后紧。十月二十四日进关列车共十列，十八点到二十四点六个钟头内不来车，六点钟以前来了一列。但从十五点三十分到十八点两个半钟头内就一起发了六列车，最后一列在十七点五十九分才由山海关运转场开出。这种“赶羊式”的行车是经常发生的，应请中央人民政府铁道部研究解决。四、专用线和专用铁道的货主不重视车辆的装卸和取送时间。
    为了克服运输力的浪费，天津铁路管理局已发布决定，指示全路加强运输管理，节约机车、车辆。具体办法是：（1）正确执行每日运输计划，严格调度纪律；各分局分界站如果没有特殊原因而不按计划送车时，对方可以拒绝接车。分局因不按计划完成排车任务而超额装车时，超额部分划归受损失的分局作为补偿。有关管理局之间分界站的规定，呈请铁道部解决。（2）规定所有机车原则上都要满轴，并在安全的基础上实行超轴。因特殊原因不能满轴时，须经分局长或管理局长批准。（3）调查整理专用线，掌握专用线装卸作业。（4）加强编组列车车站和车辆段的联系，订立站段联系合同，建立损失赔偿制度，保证按时送车交车。
