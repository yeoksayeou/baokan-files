    Some Teachers at Northwest University
    Lack the Spirit of Criticism and Self-Criticism
    Editor: This year, I obeyed the government's unified assignment of college graduates and came to Northwest University from the North China region to work as a teaching assistant. On the third day of my job, the person in charge of the department told me: "Don't take initiative at work." In our group discussions, we often argued fiercely over small things, turning the group discussions into places for emotional outbursts. When I said a few words at a group discussion, a teacher came to my room and said to me: "You are just an unknown teaching assistant, speak less." Once, the students asked the teacher teaching literature to print handouts, but because he couldn't compile them in time, he vaguely told the students: "Funding is a problem." It dragged on for five or six weeks. Later, the students came to ask me if the funding for printing handouts was a problem, and I said, "It is not a problem (this is a fact)." I became a sinner because of this, and some teachers in the department blamed me for being talkative.
    Since the launch of the ideological remolding movement for teachers in higher education institutions, the teachers at Northwest University have pledged to emulate the teachers in Beijing and Tianjin. In the past phase of study, although they have made considerable progress, there are still many problems in their thinking. Some teachers are afraid of ideological remolding. Some deliberately satirize Party members and Communist Youth League members, saying: "You can say whatever you want to us, we will never attack you for saying something wrong." In reality, they are unwilling to accept other people's opinions. They often nitpick, specifically looking for other people's shortcomings. They describe the performance of some teachers who want to make progress as acts of pursuing personal fame and status. Some teachers, in order to avoid criticism from others, always say that other people's methods are not good, or criticize others for speaking arbitrarily without considering the audience. Those who issue these incorrect arguments are obviously trying to cover up their own mistakes.
    I am willing to thoroughly remold my own thinking, and at the same time, I hope that the teachers at Northwest University will study earnestly and remold their own thinking.

### 西北大学某些教师缺乏批评和自我批评的精神

    西北大学某些教师
    缺乏批评和自我批评的精神
    编辑同志：我今年服从了政府对高等学校毕业生的统一分配，从华北区到西北大学来担任助教工作。我到工作岗位的第三天，系里的负责同志就对我说：“在工作中不要起作用。”在我们每次的小组讨论会上，常因小事情争得面红耳赤，使小组讨论会成了闹意气的场所。我在小组讨论会上说了几句话，有一位教师便到我的房里，对我说：“你还是一位无名的助教，少说话。”有一次，同学们要求教文艺学的教师印发讲义，因为一时编不出讲义，他便支吾地对同学说：“经费成问题。”一直拖延了五、六周。后来同学来问我印讲义的经费是否成问题，我说了一句“是不成问题的（这是事实）”，我便因此成了罪人，系里的某些教师都责怪我多嘴。
    高等学校教师思想改造学习运动开展以来，西北大学的教师们纷纷保证向北京、天津的教师看齐。在过去这一阶段的学习中，他们虽然已有了不小的进步，但他们思想上仍有许多问题。有的教师害怕思想改造。有的人故意挖苦党员和青年团员同志，说：“你对我们尽量地说，我们决不因你说错而攻击你。”实际上他们是不愿意接受别人的意见的。他们往往吹毛求疵，专门找别人的短处。他们把某些教师要求进步的表现，说成是追求个人名誉、地位的行为。有的教师为了逃避别人对他的批评，总是说别人的方式不好，或者批评别人不看对象任意说话。发出这些不正确的论调的人，显然是在掩饰自己的错误。
    我愿意彻底改造自己的思想，同时我更希望西北大学的教师们认真学习，改造自己的思想。
