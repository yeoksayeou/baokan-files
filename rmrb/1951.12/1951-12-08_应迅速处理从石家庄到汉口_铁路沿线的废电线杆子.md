    Should Swiftly Handle the Discarded Utility Poles Along the Shijiazhuang-Hankou Railway Line
    To the Editor: There are many discarded utility poles piled up along the railway between Shijiazhuang and Hankou. The masses in the suburbs of Neiqiu County, Hebei Province, reflect that these discarded utility poles have not been cleared since they were replaced last year. As far as I know, some of these discarded utility poles have been taken away by the local masses at will. If each discarded utility pole is calculated at 50,000 yuan, I wonder how much money these many discarded utility poles along the line are worth. Now, an anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign is being launched all over the country. I suggest that the Tianjin Railway Administration and the Zhengzhou Railway Administration promptly deal with this matter.

### 应迅速处理从石家庄到汉口  铁路沿线的废电线杆子

    应迅速处理从石家庄到汉口
    铁路沿线的废电线杆子
    编辑同志：从石家庄到汉口间的铁路两旁堆存着许多废电线杆子。河北内邱县郊区群众反映：这些废电线杆子自去年换下后到现在仍没有清理过。据我所知，其中有些废电线杆子已被当地群众随意拿走。假如每根废电线杆子以五万元计算，那么，沿线这样多的废电线杆子不知要值多少钱。现在，全国各地都在展开反贪污浪费运动，我建议天津铁路管理局和郑州铁路管理局迅速处理这件事。
