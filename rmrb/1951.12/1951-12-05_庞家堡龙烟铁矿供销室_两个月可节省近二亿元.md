    Supply and Marketing Department of Longyan Iron Mine in Pangjiabao
    Nearly 200 Million Yuan Saved in Two Months

    In the production increase and economy campaign, the Supply and Marketing Department of Longyan Iron Mine in Pangjiabao, Xuanhua City, used No. 6 detonators instead of No. 8 detonators, thus saving the country nearly 200 million yuan in wealth in two months. The No. 6 detonators have been field-tested in various mining areas of the mine, and the explosion rate is 100%, with the same effectiveness as No. 8 detonators. In the past, each No. 8 detonator cost 2,200 yuan, while each No. 6 detonator only costs 1,500 yuan. Based on the production budget for November and December, it is estimated that nearly 200 million yuan can be saved.

    庞家堡龙烟铁矿供销室
    两个月可节省近二亿元
    宣化市庞家堡龙烟铁矿供销室在增产节约运动中，利用六号雷管代替八号雷管，因而在两个月里将给国家节省近二亿元的财富。该项六号雷管已在该矿各矿区作了实地试验，结果爆炸率为百分之百，效力与八号雷管相同。过去所用的八号雷管每个为二千二百元，而六号雷管只一千五百元一个，若以十一、十二两个月的生产预算计，约可节省近二亿元。    王庆云
