Political and Legal Work Brief Commentary

    The changes in the husband-wife and mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationships in Kang Qinghe's family provide us with a good method for resolving family disputes, which is to carry out criticism and self-criticism within the family. Universally promoting this method will lead many families onto the path of democracy, harmony, and happiness, which will greatly benefit production and construction.

    In the old liberated areas, many peasant families adopted the method of family meetings early on to formulate production increase and thrift plans, and to carry out labor division according to the plans. At the same time, they also conducted criticism, self-examination, and "untied knots," promptly eliminating disputes and adjusting the relationships between various members of the family. This method has transformed many families that used to quarrel and fight all day long and had low production morale into families that were loving, united, and had high production morale, playing a significant role in promoting production.

    Currently, many women are requesting divorces. A considerable portion of these are indeed due to extremely unreasonable marriages, where harmony and love between husband and wife are fundamentally impossible. However, a significant portion is also caused by the feudalistic thinking of mothers-in-law and husbands, who subject women to feudal rule. In the latter case, as long as husbands and mothers-in-law can conduct self-criticism well, thoroughly change their attitudes towards women, and treat them equally, many families can reconcile. Therefore, it is necessary for us to universally educate husbands and mothers-in-law, making them aware of the benefits of equality between men and women and between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and of establishing democratic families. On this basis, we should carry out criticism and self-criticism within the family to eliminate family disputes.

    However, this approach should not be used as an excuse to restrict women's reasonable demands for divorce. Many cadres in grassroots Party and government organs and people's organizations do not allow the dissolution of extremely unreasonable marriage relationships forced upon women by their parents. They also attempt to use criticism and self-criticism to conduct disguised "mediation," which is impossible. On the one hand, we must actively educate husbands and mothers-in-law and actively promote and organize family criticism and self-criticism. On the other hand, we must severely punish illegal acts of abuse and battery against women. Using mediation as an excuse to allow women to continue enduring abuse and battery indefinitely, fundamentally abolishing the freedom to divorce, is completely wrong and must be immediately corrected. Every grassroots organization worker should recognize the significance of carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the family and learn to use this method to transform all families that can be transformed.

### 开展家庭中的批评与自我批评  建立民主和睦幸福的家庭

    开展家庭中的批评与自我批评
    建立民主和睦幸福的家庭
    康清和家庭的夫妻关系和婆媳关系的改变，向我们提出了一个解决家庭纠纷的好办法，这就是开展家庭中的批评与自我批评。普遍地推广这种办法，将会使许多家庭走上民主和睦与幸福的道路，这对生产建设是有很大好处的。
    在老解放区，不少的农家很早就采用了家庭会议的办法来制定增产节约计划，按计划进行劳动分工；同时也进行批评、检讨、“解疙瘩”，及时地排除纠纷，调整家庭各个成员间的关系。这种办法，曾经把许多成天吵嘴打架、生产情绪低沉的家庭变成友爱团结、生产情绪高涨的家庭，对生产起了很大推动作用。
    目前有很多妇女要求离婚。其中有相当部分的确是因为婚姻本身极不合理，夫妻间根本不可能和好，不可能发生爱情；但也确实有相当一部分，只是由于婆婆、丈夫有封建思想，对妇女实行封建统治所造成的。对于后一种情形，只要丈夫、婆婆能够很好地进行自我批评，彻底地改变对妇女的态度，平等地看待她们，有许多家庭是可以和好起来的。因此我们有必要普遍地对丈夫婆婆进行教育，使他们认识男女平等、婆媳平等、建立民主家庭的好处，并在这一基础上开展家庭中的批评与自我批评，消除家庭纠纷。
    但不能把这种作法当作藉口，来限制妇女的合理离婚要求。有许多基层党、政机关和人民团体的干部，对于父母强制包办的极不合理的婚姻关系也不许解除；也企图用批评和自我批评来做变相的“调解”那是不可能的。我们一方面要对丈夫、婆婆进行积极的教育，积极地提倡与组织家庭的批评与自我批评，但同时对虐待、打骂妇女的违法行为又必须严厉地加以制止。藉口调解，任妇女无限期地继续忍受虐待、打骂，根本取消了离婚自由，这是完全错误的，必须立即纠正。每一个基层组织的工作人员都应该认识开展家庭中的批评与自我批评的意义，并且学会运用这种方法，来改造一切可以改造的家庭。
