　　According to the Decree Issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
    The Soviet Union Sentenced Two American Spies to Death
    The Two Criminals Confessed to Sneaking into Soviet Territory in an Attempt to Carry Out Sabotage and Terrorist Activities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th] TASS, Moscow, 19th: The Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union recently tried the case of American spies, Osmanov and Sarancev. Investigation and trial proved that Osmanov and Sarancev landed in the territory of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic from an American plane at night in August this year. The Soviet State Security Agency arrested these criminals and seized from them forged documents, weapons, poisons and other tools for sabotage and terrorist activities, as well as a large sum of money. The parachutes they used were also found at the place of their arrest.
    The defendants confessed that they were recruited by American special agents from "wartime refugee" camps in West Germany in order to carry out reconnaissance, sabotage, and terrorist activities in the Soviet Union. Under the guidance of American special agents, they received specialized training in topography, shooting, parachuting, organizing sabotage, terrorism, and reconnaissance activities. Later, they sneaked into Greece, and accompanied by American officials, flew from Greece on an American plane to land on Soviet territory. They originally planned to meet with American special agents in Kars, Turkey, after completing their criminal mission.
    The defendants have pleaded guilty to their crimes during the trial. In view of the serious crimes committed by the defendants against the Soviet state, the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, in accordance with the "Decree on the Application of the Death Penalty to Traitors to the Motherland, Spies and Saboteurs" promulgated by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on January 12, 1950, sentenced the two criminals to death. The sentence has been carried out.

　　按照最高苏维埃主席团颁布的法令
    苏联判处两名美国间谍死刑
    该两犯供认潜入苏境企图进行破坏和恐怖活动
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：日前苏联最高法院军事法庭审讯了美国间谍奥斯曼诺夫和萨兰契夫的案件。调查和审讯证明，奥斯曼诺夫和萨兰契夫在今年八月的夜间从美国飞机上降落在苏联摩尔达维亚共和国境内。苏联国家保安机关逮捕了这些罪犯，并从他们身上搜获了伪造的文件、武器、毒药及其他进行破坏和恐怖活动的工具，以及大笔金钱。在逮捕他们的地方还发现了他们使用的降落伞。
    被告供认，他们是由美国特务机关从西德“战时流民”营中招募，以便在苏联进行侦察、破坏和恐怖活动的。他们在美国特务官员的指导下，受过关于地形、射击、跳伞、组织破坏、恐怖和侦察活动等专门的训练。后来他们就潜入希腊，由美国官员陪同从希腊搭美国飞机飞到苏联领土上降落。他们原拟在完成罪恶的任务后，前往土耳其的卡斯会晤美国特务官员。
    被告在审讯中已对他们的罪行一一供认不讳。苏联最高法院军事法庭鉴于被告犯有危害苏维埃国家的严重罪行，特按照苏联最高苏维埃主席团一九五○年一月十二日颁布的《关于对祖国叛徒、间谍和怠工破坏者施用死刑的法令》，对该两罪犯判处死刑。此项判决已予执行。
