    Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau Li Xue? and others
    Actively fight against corrupt elements and bureaucrats
    Saving the state over 120 million yuan in losses
    [This newspaper reports] Li Xue?, chairman of the trade union of the Beidaobu Engineering Office of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, trainee Ma Yude, and others actively fought against corrupt elements and bureaucrats, saving the state from a loss of over 122.5 million yuan in property.
    In April of this year, the Beidaobu Engineering Office signed two contracts with contractor Zhang Xingquan to undertake the excavation and transportation of rubble. However, the pricing unit of the contracts was calculated by combining excavation and transportation labor, amounting to over 293 million yuan. After being reviewed and approved by the responsible department of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, construction officially started on April 20. In mid-June, Li Xue? and Ma Yude, while handling the collection of stones and settlement of accounts at the Wei River, discovered that the contract's labor rate and unit price were inconsistent. Paying the contractor for excavating one cubic meter of rubble was 3.4 times higher than the actual excavation cost (the combined excavation and transportation costs resulted in overpayment of excavation fees). If this continued, the contractor could steal 122.5 million yuan of people's property from the total rubble excavation and transportation fees. On July 12, Li Xue? and others submitted their opinions to the administration, saying, "The longer the delay in handling this matter, the greater the loss to the people's property." He pointed out that excavation and transportation costs should be calculated separately, but the administrative leaders ignored this.
    For the sake of caution, Li Xue? and Ma Yude sent surveyor Dong Liming and League member Guo Qingzhong to conduct on-site investigations at the stone quarry and re-analyze the unit prices. After proving that their suspicions were correct, they wrote a written report requesting the administrative leaders to handle the matter. However, Zhang YeFan, the director of the office, only wrote "Consult and reduce" on the report and handed it over to Deputy Director Jin ChengLin. Although the contractor initially expressed willingness to negotiate a reasonable unit price, Jin ChengLin consistently failed to take active measures. Li Xue? once again stated: "We must stand on the side of the people's interests and not mechanically execute the contract. Overpaid amounts must also be recovered. The people's property cannot unreasonably fall into the hands of the contractor." Because Jin ChengLin protected the contractor, the next day the contractor used the excuse that the contract had been approved by the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau and could not be changed.
    Regardless of administrative obstruction, Li Xue? truthfully reported the situation to Lu Kejun, chairman of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Trade Union. At this time, Zhang YeFan said to Li Xue?: "Young people don't study enough, don't talk casually in the future." On July 25, at an administrative meeting, he sarcastically attacked Li Xue?, saying: "Some people see half a thing and think the administration is guilty of heinous crimes, reflecting things haphazardly..." Li Xue? immediately pointed out that the rubble matter was based on evidence and was not a random reflection. The meeting elected a rubble follow-up team, consisting of Guo Zuxi, Chen Zhengxiang, and Ma Yude, to be responsible for the matter. Based on the above situation, Chairman Lu Kejun sent Yu Quanwu to assist in the handling. On the 26th, Li Xue? and Ma Yude approached another contractor surnamed Diao to discuss the rubble unit price issue. The results of the research were close to the newly analyzed unit price, and Diao was also willing to take on the contract. However, the next day, Diao denied what he had said the previous day. Prior to this, Chen Zhengxiang discovered that Jin ChengLin had personally sent someone to Diao's house after the meeting, and Diao had changed his tune.
    After the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Work Group mobilized the masses of workers to oppose corruption and waste, in addition to exposing the suppression of democracy and the attack on trade union cadres by the administrative leaders of the office, it was revealed that Jin ChengLin had colluded with contractor Zhang Xingquan, accepted bribes, and leaked bid prices, illegal acts. Verifiable cases showed that he had embezzled 11 million yuan in Renminbi. Zhang YeFan was bureaucratic, irresponsible, and had accepted gifts from contractors, resulting in poor construction quality and serious waste. The Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau decided to transfer Director Zhang YeFan of the office to another position; Deputy Director Jin ChengLin was sent to the bureau's personnel department for handling, and contractor Zhang Xingquan has also been handed over to the local government for custody. The exposure of this incident saved 122.5 million yuan of state property (just in the rubble matter) from being stolen by the contractor. To this end, the Northwest China General Trade Union has written to the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Trade Union, commending the spirit of Li Xue?, Ma Yude, and others for actively fighting against corrupt elements and bureaucrats.

    为国家避免一亿二千余万元的损失
    【本报讯】西北铁路干线工程局北道埠工务所工会主席李学?、实习生马育德等，积极向贪污分子、官僚主义作斗争，使国家避免了一亿二千五百余万元财产的损失。
    北道埠工务所本年四月与包商张兴权订立了承揽挖运片石合同两件，但该项合同的计价单位是用挖工与运工合并计算的，款数达二亿九千三百余万元，经西北铁路干线工程局的主管处科审核批准，在四月二十日正式开工。六月中旬，李学?、马育德至渭河边办理收石方和清款工作中，发现这项合同工率与单价不符，挖一立方片石即多付包商挖费三点四倍（与运费合计便多付了挖费），这样错下去，包商即可从全部片石挖运费中窃取人民财产一亿二千五百余万元。七月十二日李学?等向行政上提出意见说：“晚处理一天则人民财产会多受损失的。”他指出挖、运费应分开计算，但行政领导同志却置之不理。
    李学?、马育德为了慎重起见，派测工董立明、团员郭庆锺前往石场实地调查，重新分析单价，证明属实，写出书面报告，请求行政领导同志处理。但该所主任张冶范接到报告后仅批“工洽减”三字，交副主任靳成麟办。开始包商虽然表示愿意协商合理单价，但靳成麟始终不作积极处理，李学?同志再度提出：“我们要站在人民利益的立场，不能机械的执行合同，已经多付款项亦须追回，人民财产不能不合理的落在包商手里。”由于靳成麟庇护包商，次日包商便藉口合同是经西北铁路干线工程局批准的，不能更改。
    李学?不顾行政上的阻拦，据实报告给西北铁路干线工会路克军主席。这时，张冶范对李学?说：“年青人学习的不够，以后不要随便说话。”七月二十五日在行政会议上又讽刺打击李学?说：“有人看一半点事情，便认为行政上罪大恶极了，乱反映……。”李学?立刻指出片石的事是有证据，不是乱反映。会议上推选出处理片石善后小组，由过祖熹、陈正翔、马育德负责。根据以上情况，路克军主席又派于权五协助处理。二十六日李学?、马育德找来另一个姓刁的包商洽谈片石单价问题，研究结果与所分析的新单价相近，刁也愿意包，但次日刁又否认昨日所谈。事前陈正翔发现靳成麟亲派人会后赴刁家一次，刁便改了口气。
    经西北铁路干线工程工作组发动职工群众反对贪污浪费后，除暴露该所行政领导压制民主、打击工会干部外，并揭发出靳成麟勾结包商张兴权，接受贿赂，泄露标底的违法行为，有据可查者贪污人民币一千一百万元。张冶范官僚主义，不负责任，并曾接受包商礼物，造成施工工程质量粗劣和严重浪费现象。经西北铁路干线工程局决定：该所主任张冶范另行调职；副主任靳成麟送局人事处处理，包商张兴权亦已送交当地政府管押。这一事件的揭发，使国家财产一亿二千五百余万元（仅片石问题），免遭包商所窃。为此，西北总工会已写信给西北铁路干线工会，表扬李学?、马育德等积极向贪污分子和官僚主义者进行斗争的精神。
