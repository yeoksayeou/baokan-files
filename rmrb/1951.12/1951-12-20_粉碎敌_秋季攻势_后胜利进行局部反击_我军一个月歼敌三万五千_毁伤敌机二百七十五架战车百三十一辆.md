    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: Our frontline reporter reports: November was a month in which the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, after thoroughly crushing Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," launched counterattacks in local areas against the enemy, continued to repel enemy offensives, and annihilated a large number of enemy troops.

    After achieving a brilliant victory of annihilating more than 88,000 enemy troops in the battle to thoroughly crush Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, starting in early November, launched powerful counterattacks in local areas of the western and central fronts against the heavily damaged enemy forces. Heroic infantry units, with the coordination of powerful artillery units, repeatedly and rapidly captured enemy positions with strong fortifications in the Malang Mountain area west of Tieyuan, the area near Xidong northwest of Tieyuan, the area from Yujishanli to Zhengdong northwest of Lianchuan, and the area south of Jinzhou, annihilating many enemy companies and battalions, and repelling and annihilating many enemy troops who frantically counterattacked us. In mid-November, after repelling another enemy counterattack towards the Malang Mountain area, a certain unit of our army on the western front launched a counterattack on Gaowang Mountain and the highlands north of it with the coordination of powerful artillery fire, causing the enemy troops occupying these areas to suffer another heavy blow.

    In late November, a certain unit of our army, with the coordination of powerful artillery fire, launched another counterattack against enemy troops who had reoccupied Gaowang Mountain, annihilating nearly a battalion of enemy troops in one fell swoop. At the same time, a certain unit of our army west of Tieyuan also continuously counterattacked the enemy. On the eastern front, enemy troops who frantically attacked us in the area east of the North Han River were also met with head-on blows by our army, suffering heavy casualties. On the east coast, after a certain unit of our army recovered Gaocheng in mid-November, it continued to advance victoriously, pushing the front line five kilometers south.

    The units of our army responsible for protecting coastal security launched amphibious island assault operations against the U.S. and Syngman Rhee bandit troops on the islands along the coast north of the mouth of the Cheongcheon River on the west coast. At the end of November, a unit of our army eliminated the last sea stronghold of the enemy in northwestern Korea - Daewa Island and Sowa Island, severely打击了the enemy's military conspiracy to use the islands north of the 38th parallel to undermine the rear of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The above battle situation shows that the increasingly stronger Korean and Chinese People's Armies have not only victoriously implemented the military strategy of annihilating enemy manpower in defensive battles but also in counterattack battles.

    Below are the consolidated battle results of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in November:

    I. Annihilated 35,151 enemy troops, including 10,206 U.S. aggressor troops, 2,047 British accomplice troops, 247 Canadian accomplice troops, 327 Thai accomplice troops, 128 Turkish accomplice troops, and 22,196 Syngman Rhee puppet troops.
