    What kind of path did I take before Liberation?
    You Gu'en, Professor of Chinese Language and Literature Department, Peking University
    I am someone who served in the old education system. I basically taught for personal livelihood. Although I was dissatisfied with the reactionary rule and my own situation in the past, I did not have the determination to resist. Objectively, I more or less helped the Kuomintang promote reactionary education, playing a role in numbing the minds of young people and hindering the progress of the revolution. I myself thought that my more than twenty years of "above politics" and "above party affiliation" teaching life was considered relatively "noble." Now, upon reflection, this idea is completely wrong. Take the period when I taught at Southwest Associated University during the Anti-Japanese War as an example: At that time, the professors were clearly divided into left and right factions. On the one hand, I saw the Kuomintang reactionaries, especially the Four Big Families, being corrupt and not resisting Japan, with all levels of civil and military officials making fortunes from the national crisis. I felt very resentful in my heart. On the other hand, influenced by the malicious propaganda of the reactionaries, I was also very dissatisfied with the Communist Party. Therefore, I held a so-called neutral attitude, practicing self-preservation and walking the "middle road," never talking about politics, hiding myself under the guise of academics, isolating myself from the world. Any newspapers or magazines that wanted manuscripts, I only wrote articles about academic topics, never touching upon the current situation or politics. The Kunming newspapers all asked me to write "Sunday Essays," but I refused them all with various reasons. Wen Yiduo was an old friend of mine, and we had a good relationship with each other, and we were very compatible in doing old-style scholarship. Due to the transformation of his thinking, he frequently gave passionate speeches at various gatherings, attacking the reactionary government, and frankly admitted that he was following the Soviet line, coldly ridiculing our neutral attitude. But I always kept my mouth shut, and in my heart, I strongly disagreed. Therefore, our friendship suffered a great deal in secret. In appearance, we gradually became estranged, and we were even unwilling to talk about academic matters. When the "December 1st" tragedy occurred, the students insisted on striking, and the situation escalated. On the surface, I, like other professors, sympathized with the students, donated money for condolences, and attended memorial services, but in reality, I did not cooperate with the students, let alone approve of the students' indefinite strike. Fu Sinian, under the order of the then Chongqing puppet Ministry of Education, came to Kunming to suppress the "student unrest" and attended the Southwest Associated University faculty meeting. After Wen Yiduo spoke, Fu Sinian openly criticized him as a "Bolshevik," deliberately expanding the unrest and undermining higher education. At that time, many professors actually applauded. Although I did not speak at the time, I also applauded in agreement. This proves that when the struggle becomes acute, my "middle road" no longer exists. Not only did my personal "middle road" cease to exist, but in that applause, one could hardly smell the "middle road."
    When the news of the Japanese surrender came, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep all night. When Chairman Mao flew to Chongqing, my happy mood was even more indescribable. I thought that now that we had defeated the enemy, it was a good opportunity to build the country. As long as everyone worked together in harmony, the future of the country would be very bright. Unexpectedly, after several months, the negotiations ultimately failed. At that time, I was very disappointed, but in my heart, I blamed the Communist Party for "demanding too high a price," refusing to compromise slightly, resulting in a stalemate. I could not see that it was the Kuomintang reactionaries' consistent conspiracy to deliberately sabotage peace and launch a civil war. At that time, my view of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was based on a subjective perspective. I always felt that the Kuomintang was the "orthodox" party, and the Communist Party was making trouble, refusing to cooperate with it. I fundamentally did not understand what kind of "country" the Kuomintang reactionaries represented, and what kind of regime the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek represented. Now, upon reflection, my views and thoughts on politics and the current situation at that time were obviously very wrong, and it is also very clear that my position was on the side of the anti-people. How can I still insist on saying "above party affiliation" and "above class"?
    In 1946, I returned to Beijing. The tide of the democratic movement was rising day by day, and the struggle between progressive youth, democrats, and the reactionaries was becoming increasingly acute. During this period, in the anti-atrocity movement triggered by the Shen Chong incident in various schools, as well as the movements against hunger, persecution, and against American imperialism's support of Japanese bandits, students were beaten or went missing, schools were surrounded and searched, and the puppet police and gendarmerie demanded people from the schools based on blacklists. The East Dormitory of Peking University was smashed to pieces, and Normal University was even worse. What attitude did I take towards this series of student movements? In a word, it was still the "middle road." The specific manifestations were: In class, I also scolded the reactionary government, saying that it should not persecute students, and scolded the "Three Youth League" students for betraying their classmates; I expressed care for progressive students and expressed deep sympathy for their just actions. When they came to visit, I always said nice things in a grand manner. In fact, I never participated in any democratic square rallies or demonstrations related to the student movement (of course, I never participated in any gatherings or parades created by the reactionaries). Someone offered me a particularly generous fee to write articles for "Weekly Essays," but I politely declined. However, I wrote several academic articles in other reactionary newspapers such as the "North China Daily" supplement and in magazines funded by the reactionaries such as "Learning Origin." The purpose was only for the稿费 and I thought that academics was "above politics," not knowing that I had fallen right into the reactionaries' trap, allowing them to achieve the purpose of attracting middle elements, decorating the reactionary facade, blurring the consciousness of struggle, and weakening the revolutionary forces. There were also several righteous signatures initiated by some professors from various universities in Beijing, such as supporting the student movement and opposing the dissolution of the Democratic League. I signed all of them. However, when progressive students in my department asked me to be a consultant for the Jiemin Library run by the student union, wanting to win me over to progress, I firmly refused, returning the letter of appointment, as if I were afraid of getting involved in something. During the siege of Beijing before liberation, I was outwardly calm but inwardly wavering. Although I did not register at the Peking University Secretary-General's Office to take the plane sent by the puppet Ministry of Education, I did consider this question in my heart. Analyzing my motives at the time, in addition to fearing the threat of artillery fire, the main thing was to escape liberation.
    In short, in the past, I was subjectively afraid of progress and afraid of revolution. The reason why I was backward for a long time cannot be simply covered up and excused by the reactionary government's blockade and counter-propaganda. The reason why I hated the Kuomintang reactionaries was not true hatred, but seeing their corruption, making fortunes from national crisis, victory, and taking over assets, messing up the country, and inevitably perishing together with the revolutionary forces in the face of the growing strength of the revolutionary forces. This was simply a feeling of being in the same boat in a storm, not a question of hate or not. The reason why I sympathized with the student movement was not true sympathy, but perfunctoryness, self-preservation, and subjectively, there was not the slightest intention of leaning towards the people and moving towards revolution. This is entirely a concrete manifestation of the petty-bourgeois selfish individualism. Speaking of this, one cannot but relate to the influence of Hu Shi's thought on me.
    What influence did Hu Shi have on me? I studied at Peking University for six years. Although I did not take Hu Shi's class because I was in a different department, he advocated "organizing national heritage" and published many articles on Chinese literature. After reading them, I felt that they suited my taste very well, and I thought that his set of textual research methods was a "scientific method" that could solve problems. I admired him very much in my heart. So I took the initiative to visit him, took my articles to show him, hoping to get his praise and introduce me to publish them. Later, he even printed my articles in the "Reading Magazine" of the "Endeavor" newspaper. At that time, I really felt glorious. From then on, I was determined to throw myself into the dead end, burying my head in studying hard and doing some impractical textual research work; on the other hand, I also ran a publication with several friends and successively printed my articles to hunt for fame. At that time, Peking University had already been divided into new and old factions in terms of academic thought. There were many publications run by faculty and students, but I didn't even like to read "New Tide," let alone "Guide." It was placed in various college and dormitory rooms for sale, but I never looked at it. Only the "Endeavor" newspaper, especially its weekly supplement "Reading Magazine," was a must-buy. Although I also read "Yu Si," "Mang Yuan," and Lu Xun's novels and essays, I only treated them as pastimes after tea and dinner. My conservatism and backwardness developed increasingly due to Hu Shi's guidance, so that not only did I not recognize reality, but I also became more and more distant from reality day by day.
    Hu Shi once shouted the slogan of "academic independence." This slogan had two kinds of influence: on the one hand, it induced intellectuals to conduct academic research under the beautiful name of "noble," seemingly not dependent on politics, but actually serving the reactionary government. In this way, so-called intellectuals and scholars entered the reactionary government's trap one by one. On the other hand, it made a large number of backward intellectuals, under the pretext of "academic independence," not ask about politics and escape reality. The result was only beneficial to the reactionary regime. Hu Shi's thoughts and words once led a large number of backward petty-bourgeois intellectuals and other people of all classes who could be left or right to fall to the reactionary government. He induced the majority of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals to linger on the path of reform for a long time, holding the attitude of "academic independence," "above class," and "above reality," directly or indirectly helping or providing assistance to the reactionary government, decorating or supporting it, playing a huge role in hindering the advancement of the revolution, consolidating the reactionary regime, and prolonging and increasing the suffering of the people. In the past, under the influence of Hu Shi's slogan of "academic independence," I unconsciously fulfilled a responsibility of promoting reactionary education to serve reactionary politics.
    I was very disgusted with the Kuomintang reactionary government's corruption, tyranny, degeneration, and decay. At the same time, because I had read several old books, I very much believed in the old Confucian doctrines of "there are rulers, but no rules" and "when the people exist, the government prospers." Hu Shi's slogan of "good people government" really hit my heart again. Later, seeing that due to his recommendation or encouragement, a group of university professors such as Wang Shijie, Weng Wenhao, Jiang Tingfu, and others all joined the reactionary government one after another, taking on important roles, I thought that the "good people government" was about to be realized. Therefore, my hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries gradually decreased. I thought that bad guys were only a small number of people, and in the future, when "good people" gradually increased, bad guys would naturally gradually decrease, evil would not overcome righteousness, and the country would have a turnaround. Hu Shi greatly encouraged the reactionary government in this way, invisibly winning countless petty-bourgeois intellectuals to support the reactionary regime. Naturally, I was one of them. I often thought: We must first make ourselves a "good person" before we can do "good deeds" in the future. If everyone can be as content and hardworking as I am, wouldn't the country get better? I was indeed so naive and confused at the time, and such naive people were seen as the more the better by the reactionaries.
    The above is only a preliminary ideological examination of my study in this ideological reform, and of course, it is very superficial. How to conduct an in-depth review, eliminate all remaining reactionary thoughts, and criticize incorrect thoughts still requires continuous learning.

    我在解放前走的是怎样一条道路
    北京大学  中国语文系教授  游国恩
    我是在旧教育界服务过的人。我基本上是为着个人生活而教书，过去虽不满意于反动统治和自己的境遇，但是没有反抗的决心，并且在客观上或多或少替国民党推行反动教育，起了麻痹青年思想、阻碍革命进展的作用。而我自己却以为二十多年“超政治”“超党派”的教书生活，总算比较“清高”。现在检查起来，这种想法是十分错误的。就拿抗日战争期间我在西南联合大学教书的一段事实来说罢：那时候教授中显然分为左右两派，我呢，一方面看见国民党反动派，尤其是四大家族贪污腐化而不抗日，大小文武官吏无不个个发国难财，心中非常痛恨；一方面受反动派恶意宣传的影响，对共产党也很不满意，于是我就抱着所谓超然的中立态度，明哲保身，走“中间路线”，绝口不谈政治，躲在学术的幌子下把自己同世界隔离起来，任何报章杂志要稿子，只写些关于学术性的文章，对时局、政治根本不沾边。昆明各报都曾请过我写“星期论文”，我一概用种种理由谢绝了。闻一多是我的老朋友，彼此的交情很不错，搞旧学问也甚为投契。由于思想的转变，他经常在各种集会上发表激烈言论，攻击反动政府，并坦白承认他是走苏联路线，冷酷地讥讽我们的中立态度。而我总是不开口，心中却大不以为然。因此，我们的友谊暗中有了很大的损伤，在形迹上我们逐渐疏远了，甚至连学问也不愿谈了。“一二、一”惨案发生，学生坚持罢课，事态日益扩大，表面上我和其他教授一样，同情学生，捐款慰问，参加追悼会，但实际上却不同学生合作，更不赞成学生无限期罢课。傅斯年奉当时重庆伪教育部命令，到昆明来压制“学潮”，出席西南联合大学教授会。闻一多发言之后，傅斯年公然指摘他为“布尔什维克”，有意扩大风潮，破坏高等教育，当时许多教授竟都鼓掌。当时我虽没有发言，但也鼓掌赞成。这就证明了斗争一到尖锐化的时候，我的“中间路线”就不存在了。不但我个人的“中间路线”不复存在，在那掌声中简直闻不到“中间路线”的气息。
    日寇投降的消息传来，我兴奋得连夜睡不着觉。毛主席飞到重庆的时候，我的愉快心情更难以形容。认为现在打败了敌人，正是建设国家的好机会，只要大家和衷共济，国家前途是非常光明的。不料经过几个月，协商终不成功，当时我非常失望，心里却怪共产党“要价太高”，不肯稍事迁就，以至造成僵局，而竟看不到蓄意破坏和平，发动内战是国民党反动派一贯的阴谋。我那时对于国共两党的看法，存有主客观念，总觉得国民党是“正统”，共产党闹蹩扭，不同它合作，而根本不了解国民党反动派所代表的“国家”是什么国家，人民公敌蒋介石所代表的政权是什么政权。现在检查起来，当时我对政治、时局的一切看法和想法，错误非常明显，我的立场是站在反人民一边也是极其显然的，如何还硬要说“超党派”、“超阶级”呢？
    一九四六年，我回到北京。民主运动的浪潮日益高涨，进步青年、民主人士同反动派的斗争日益尖锐。在此期间，各学校由沈崇事件所引起的抗暴运动，以及反饥饿、反迫害、反对美帝国主义扶植日寇等运动中，学生被殴打或失踪，学校被包围被搜查，伪警宪根据黑名单向学校要人，北京大学东斋被打得一塌胡涂，师范大学更惨。我对于这一连串的学生运动又采取什么态度呢？一言以蔽之，还是“中间路线”。其具体表现是：在课堂上我也骂过反动政府，说它不该迫害学生，骂“三青团”的学生不该出卖同学；对进步同学表示爱护，对他们的正义行动表示深切同情。当他们来访问时，我总是冠冕堂皇地说得好听；事实上任何一次有关学运的民主广场大会或示威游行，我从来没有参加过（当然也没有参加过反动派所制造的任何集会或游行）。有人以特别优厚的稿费请我为“周论”写文章，我婉辞谢绝。但在其他反动报纸如华北日报等副刊上和反动派出钱办的杂志如“学原”上，却写了几篇学术性的文章。目的只是为稿费，并且以为学术是“超政治”的，而不知正中了反动派的诡计，使他们达到拉拢中间分子，点缀反动门面，模糊斗争意识，削弱革命力量的目的。还有几次北京各大学一部分教授所发起的正义签名，例如援助学生运动、反对解散民盟等，我都签过名。但本系进步学生请我做学生自治会办的孑民图书室的顾问，想争取我进步，我却坚决拒绝，退回聘书，好像怕有什么沾惹似的。在解放前北京围城中，我表面镇静，内心动摇，虽然没有到北京大学秘书长室登记去坐伪教育部派来的飞机，但心里确曾考虑过这一问题。分析我当时的动机，除了怕炮火的威胁外，主要还是想逃避解放。
    总之，过去我主观上是害怕进步的，害怕革命的。我之所以长期落后，决不能单拿反动政府的封锁和反宣传为理由来掩饰自己，原谅自己。我之所以恨国民党反动派，不是真恨，而是看见他们贪污腐化，发国难财、胜利财、接收财，把国家搞糟了，在革命力量日益壮大的情势下，必然会同归于尽。这简直是风雨同舟之感，并不是恨不恨的问题。我之所以同情学生运动，也不是真同情，而是敷衍，明哲保身，主观上没有丝毫靠拢人民，走向革命的企图。这完全是小资产阶级自私自利的个人主义思想的具体表现。说到这里，就不能不联系到胡适思想所给我的影响。
    胡适给过我什么影响呢？我在北京大学读过六年书，虽然由于不同系，没有上过胡适的课，但他提倡“整理国故”，发表许多有关中国文学的文章，我读了之后，觉得很合乎我的口胃，而且认为他那一套考据的方法是“科学方法”，能解决问题，心中十分仰慕。于是自动去拜访他，拿文章给他看，希望得到赞赏，给我介绍发表。后来他竟把我的文章印在“努力”报的“读书杂志”上，我当时实在觉得光荣。从此以后，我就决心把自己投进牛角尖里去，一面埋着头用全力读死书，做一些脱离实际的考证工作；一面又同几个朋友办一个刊物，陆续把自己的文章印出来，猎取名誉。那时北京大学在学术思想上已经分为新旧两派，教员和学生办的刊物多得很，但我连“新潮”都不爱看，“向导”更不消说，摆在各院各宿舍号房代售，我从来不会瞧它一眼。只有“努力”报，尤其是它的星期增刊“读书杂志”则非买不可。“语丝”、“莽原”及鲁迅的小说和杂文之类虽然也看，但只把它当作茶余酒后的消遣品。我的保守性和落后性由于胡适的诱导而日益发展，使我不但不认识现实，而且同现实一天天距离得更远。
    胡适曾经高喊“学术独立”的口号，这个口号有两种影响：一方面是诱致知识分子在一个“清高”的美名下进行学术研究，表面上好像不依附政治，实际上替反动政府服务。这样一来，所谓知识分子、学者们便一个个进入反动政府的圈套。另一方面是使大批落后的知识分子藉口“学术独立”，不问政治，逃避现实。而其结果也只是对于反动政权有利。胡适的思想言论曾经领导着广大的落后的小资产阶级知识分子以及其他可左可右的各阶层的人们倒向反动政府。他引诱了多数资产阶级小资产阶级知识分子长期彷徨于改良的迷路上，抱着“学术独立”、“超阶级”、“超现实”的态度，直接间接地替反动政府帮忙或帮闲，点缀或捧场，对于阻碍革命的前进，巩固反动政权，延长并增加人民痛苦起了巨大作用。过去我就是在胡适这个“学术独立”的口号影响下，不自觉地尽了一分推行反动教育以服务于反动政治的责任。
    国民党反动政府贪污横暴，堕落腐化，我本非常厌恶。同时由于我念过几本旧书，对于旧时儒家学说所谓“有治人，无治法”，所谓“人存则政举”等等老教条是非常相信的。胡适的“好人政府”的口号真的又打中了我的心窍。后来看见由于他的推荐或鼓励，一班大学教授如王世杰、翁文灏、蒋廷黻等人都一个个先后加入反动政府，担任重要角色，便以为“好人政府”马上就要实现了。因此我对于国民党反动派的憎恨情绪就逐渐降低了，以为坏蛋只是少数几个人，将来“好人”逐渐多起来，坏人自然会逐渐减少，邪不敌正，国家就会有转机了。胡适这样大大地给反动政府打了气，无形中替它争取了无数的小资产阶级知识分子向心于反动政权，自然我也是其中的一个。我常常这么想：我们必须首先使自己成为一个“好人”，将来才能够做“好事”，假使个个都能像我这样安分守己，努力工作，国家还不会好起来吗？我当时的确就这样幼稚、糊涂，而这样幼稚的人，在反动派看来是越多越好。
    以上只是我在此次思想改造学习中一点初步的思想检查，当然是很肤浅的。如何深入检讨，肃清一切反动思想残余和批判不正确思想，还有待于继续不断的学习。
