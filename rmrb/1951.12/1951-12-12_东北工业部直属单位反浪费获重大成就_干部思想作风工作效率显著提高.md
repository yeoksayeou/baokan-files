    Northeast Industrial Department Directly Subordinate Units Achieve Major Achievements in Anti-Waste
    Cadre Ideological Style and Work Efficiency Significantly Improved
    [This newspaper reports] The anti-waste movement in the directly subordinate units of the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department has achieved significant results. According to the materials examined in several units, the losses caused to the state by waste are serious. When the Nonferrous Metals Administration was building the Huatong Concentrator, due to not clarifying the underground resource situation beforehand, it built factory buildings and reservoirs that could not be fully utilized for a time, wasting 1.55 billion yuan. The Coal Mine Administration sent Wei Zishan to Tianjin to purchase safety lamps. Wei colluded with private merchants and was irresponsible in his work. Of the 10,250 sets of lamps purchased, because of poor quality, most have been distributed for repair, but 2,865 sets are still stockpiled in Fuxin, totaling more than 400 million yuan in tied-up funds. According to statistics from the Electrical Industry Bureau's Basic Construction Division, Materials Division, and Administrative Division, waste in various aspects amounted to as much as 1.3 billion yuan, of which 65 percent was lost due to the poor quality of purchased materials, and 20 percent was lost due to poor planning. When the Light Industry Administration was building the No. 144 paper machine in a certain paper mill, the foundation was designed too deep, resulting in a waste of 2 billion yuan in the entire project. More than 100 rolls of tire cord fabric purchased by the bureau in Shanghai could not be used after purchase due to careless technical inspection, resulting in a loss of more than 2 billion yuan. The Electric Power Bureau wasted 3.3 billion yuan in the construction of substations in Jilin and other places due to lack of investigation and research and poor planning. The above-mentioned items alone wasted more than 10 billion yuan. In terms of the management organ's living system, the Industrial Department's Administrative Division uncovered 231 instances of waste, involving: casual spending on receptions; unplanned printing of documents, resulting in massive waste; lack of care for public property; failure to protect and save office supplies; lax cash management, prolonged arrears of public funds; certain financial expenditures exceeding regulations; and too many temporary repairs, resulting in a lot of waste due to poor planning. These phenomena exist to varying degrees in other units as well. For example, for two-story dormitories with a construction area of one million square meters, just calculating the mortar used for bricklaying, simply changing the commonly used cement-sand mortar to lime-sand mortar can save nearly 70,000 tons of cement, equivalent to more than 42 billion yuan. Another example is that the formwork used in general reinforced concrete construction was mostly specified to be used only three times in the past, and even only once or twice. Calculating from a construction area of one million square meters, 200,000 cubic meters of wood would be required for formwork, but in reality, the number of times formwork is used can be increased to at least nine times with slight technical improvements. This means that two-thirds of the wood can be saved for the state, that is, more than 133,000 cubic meters of wood, which, calculated at the October price, is worth about 133 billion yuan.
    Starting with the places with the most waste to expose and propose improvement methods is of great significance for accumulating capital and expanding industrial construction. Many facts prove that any loophole in important construction projects will cause huge losses to the state. It is precisely because the movement focuses on exposing waste in basic construction that the basic construction work can be improved one step further. During this movement, the Industrial Department's Basic Construction Division specially convened a civil engineering work symposium, at which they specifically discussed how to save materials. Because all units attached importance to this work, conducted inspections, and proposed improvement methods, it has greatly helped to improve basic construction work in the future.
    This movement has not only made all staff realize that waste is as shameful as corruption, but also further examined their own ideological style. In the past, some people believed that "corruption is shameful, waste is an unavoidable phenomenon in work, and there is nothing to be done about it"; "There is no bottom to waste phenomena (?) and it is impossible to oppose it (?)"; some people pushed the responsibility for waste to objective difficulties, shirking responsibility; some technicians believed that they were engaged in technology, and anti-waste had nothing to do with them (?). In fact, from the many facts exposed, it not only involves leadership style, work plans and systems, but also involves everyone's work style and work attitude, involves what attitude each staff member takes towards state property, and involves the ideological transformation of technicians. For example, the Electrical Industry Bureau encountered various obstacles at the beginning of the movement. After mobilization, education, and detailed accounting, each staff member realized the seriousness of waste. Everyone not only exposed the facts of waste, but also examined their own ideological style, and strengthened the concept of cherishing state wealth and being responsible to the state and the people. The bureau's technicians have launched a "self- (ideological) transformation" movement. The staff of the Industrial Department's Basic Construction Division (especially the technicians) extensively carried out criticism and self-criticism in the movement. Many technicians reviewed the various erroneous thoughts that existed in the past: one was the guest mentality and hired labor viewpoint, wanting more pay and doing less work; the second was the purely technical viewpoint, believing that they were engaged in technology, and politics had nothing to do with them, lacking a sense of responsibility to the country and the people; the third was freedom and laxity, not obeying organizational discipline, holding the attitude of not making big mistakes but constantly making small mistakes, and lacking a strong sense of career; the fourth was the guild viewpoint, engaging in sectarianism, unable to learn from each other's strengths, study and improve business, and therefore progress was slow.
    The anti-waste movement directly improved work. For example, the staff of the Industrial Department's Administrative Division not only exposed 231 instances of waste, but also proposed more than 100 ways to improve work and eliminate waste; in the directly subordinate organs of the Electric Power Bureau, after being proposed by the masses and studied by the leadership, thirteen prohibitions were stipulated (generally, no guest meals and cigarettes are allowed, no extra reimbursements are allowed, no expenditures are allowed without a budget, no private loans are allowed for reimbursement, no reimbursement for lost items is allowed, no sofas and carpets are allowed, no entertaining and gift-giving is allowed, no tea and snacks are allowed at meetings, surplus materials are not allowed to be sold without approval, no gifts from private merchants are allowed, no embezzlement of public funds and materials is allowed, no long-distance calls are allowed, and the use of houses and cars is not allowed to exceed regulations); the Industrial Department's Basic Construction Division, in order to improve leadership style and improve the work efficiency of various departments, formulated various systems, divided work scopes and responsibilities; other departments are discussing formulating production increase and economy plans and revising patriotic covenants.

### 东北工业部直属单位反浪费获重大成就  干部思想作风工作效率显著提高

    东北工业部直属单位反浪费获重大成就
    干部思想作风工作效率显著提高
    【本报讯】东北人民政府工业部各直属单位的反浪费运动已获得了重大的成绩。根据几个单位中检查的材料证明，浪费给国家造成的损失是严重的。有色金属管理局在建筑华铜选矿厂时，由于事先未弄清地下资源情况，建设了一时无法全部利用的厂房及贮水池，浪费资金达十五亿五千万元；煤矿管理局派魏子山去天津购买安全灯，魏与私商拉拢，工作不负责任，买回的一万零二百五十套灯，因质量不好，除大部已分发修理后使用外，在阜新仍积压着二千八百六十五套，共积压了资金四亿多元。根据电器工业局基本建设处、材料处、行政处三个单位的统计，各方面的浪费即达十三亿元之多，其中因购买的材料质量不好而损失的占百分之六十五，属于计划不周而造成损失的占百分之二十。轻工业管理局建设某纸厂一四四号造纸机时，由于设计时将基础做的太深，在整个工程中即浪费了二十亿元。该局在上海买的帘子丝布一百多匹，因进行技术检查时马虎，买回来后不能用，损失二十余亿元；电业局在修建吉林等变电所时，由于未调查研究、计划不周等计浪费三十三亿元。只上述几项，即浪费一百余亿元。在管理机关生活制度方面，工业部行政处即揭发了二百三十一件浪费的事实，所涉及到的有：招待方面随便开支；印刷文件时无计划，造成大量浪费；不爱惜公物；不注意爱护和节省办公用具；现金管理不严，长时期拖欠公款；某些财政开支超过制度；各种临时性修缮太多，由于计划的不好，造成很多浪费。这些现象，在其他单位也或多或少的存在着。如建筑面积为一百万平方米的二层楼宿舍，仅就砌墙用的胶泥方面来计算，只要将过去常用的水泥砂胶泥改用石灰砂胶泥，即可节省水泥近七万吨。折合人民币则约四二○亿余元。又如过去一般钢筋混凝土建筑所使用的模型板，大都只规定使用到三次，甚至还有仅使用一两次的。若从一百万平方米的建筑面积计算，则需用模型板二十万立方米木材，但实际上模型板的使用次数只要在技术上稍加改进，即至少可使用到九次以上。这样，就是说可为国家节省三分之二的木材，即十三万三千多立方米木材，以十月份的价格计算，折合人民币约值一千三百三十亿元。
    从浪费最大的地方着手进行揭发，并提出改进办法，对于积累资本，扩大工业建设有重要的意义。许多事实证明：凡重要的修建工程，任何一个漏洞都会给国家造成巨大的损失。正由于运动中着重揭发了基本建设方面的浪费，就可能将基本建设工作提高一步。在此次运动中，工业部基本建设处曾专门召开了土木工程工作座谈会，在会议上专门讨论了如何节省材料的问题。由于各个单位都重视了这一工作，进行了检查，并提出改进办法，对今后改善基本建设工作有很大帮助。
    经过这一运动不仅使全体工作人员认识了浪费与贪污同样是可耻的行为，而且进一步检查了自己的思想作风。过去有人认为：贪污是可耻的，浪费是工作中不可免的现象，没有什么”；“浪费现象没底（？）无法反（？）”；有的人将浪费的责任推到客观困难上去，推卸责任；有的技术人员认为自己是搞技术的，反浪费和自己没有关系（？），实际上，从揭发的许多事实中，不但涉及到领导作风、工作计划和制度，同时涉及到每个人的工作作风和工作态度，涉及到每个工作人员对待国家财产采取什么态度，涉及到技术人员的思想改造问题。如电器工业局在运动开始时，曾碰到过各种障碍，经动员，教育，和算细账，使每个工作人员认识了浪费的严重性，大家不但揭发了浪费的事实，而且检查了自己的思想作风，加强了全体工作人员爱护国家财富和对国家对人民负责的观念。该局技术人员已发起了“自我（思想）改造”运动。工业部基本建设处的工作人员（特别是技术人员），在运动中广泛地展开了批评和自我批评，许多技术人员检讨了自己过去存在着的各种错误思想：一种是作客思想和雇佣观点，工薪要的多，工作要少做；第二种是单纯技术观点，认为自己是搞技术的，政治和自己无关，缺乏对国家和人民负责的观点；第三种是自由散漫，不服从组织纪律，抱着大错不犯小错不断的态度，事业心不强；第四种是行会观点，闹宗派，不能相互取长补短，研究和提高业务，因而进步不快。
    反浪费运动直接地改进了工作。如工业部行政处的工作人员不但揭发了二百三十一条浪费的事实，而且提出了一百多条改进工作、杜绝浪费的办法；在电工局直属机关中，经群众提议，领导上加以研究，规定出了十三个不准（一般情况下不准招待客饭和香烟、不准有额外报销、没有预算不准开支、私人借款不准报销、丢失东西不准报销、不准买沙发地毯、不准请客送礼、开会时不准吃茶点和糖果、剩余物资不经批准不准出卖、不准接受私商礼物、不准挪用公款公物、不准乱打长途电话、房子和汽车的使用不准超过规定）；工业部基本建设处为改善领导作风，提高各部门工作效率，则拟订了各种制度、划分了工作范围和职责；另有的部门正在讨论制订增产节约计划、修订爱国公约。
