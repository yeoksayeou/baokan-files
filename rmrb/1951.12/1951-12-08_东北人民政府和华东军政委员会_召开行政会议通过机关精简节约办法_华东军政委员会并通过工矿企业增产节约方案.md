    [This newspaper dispatch] The Northeast People's Government convened its 20th administrative meeting on the morning of November 28th to discuss the issues of economy and living standards in Northeast first-level organs. At the meeting, Li Youwen, Director of the Northeast First-Level Organs Living System Review Committee and Secretary-General of the Northeast People's Government, spoke first. He pointed out that in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy and to implement Chairman Gao Gang's instructions, and in order to strictly enforce the living system and practice strict economy, a thorough inspection and study of the current living system of the Northeast first-level organs has been carried out, and the "Northeast First-Level Organs Economy Measures" has been drafted. Secretary-General Li Youwen then explained the regulations in the measures regarding the use of houses, construction equipment, water and electricity consumption, office expenses, cadre life, car use, meeting receptions, personnel transfers, odd-job personnel, nannies, and family members.
    During the discussion, the committee members unanimously approved the measures for economy in government organs.
    Chairman Gao Gang pointed out in his concluding speech: Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy is to build our country into a prosperous and strong country. The key is to establish a strong industry. Only in this way can we strengthen our national defense forces, effectively oppose imperialist aggression, strive for victory in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and gradually improve the people's material life. This is now the focus of all work and the central task of the entire Chinese people. All departments should deeply understand Chairman Mao's thinking, learn Chairman Mao's spirit of thrift, and carry forward the fine revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living. Leading comrades should conscientiously conduct inspections, educate the people, and educate cadres to earnestly practice economy in order to accumulate funds and invest in industrial production, so as to build our country into the most powerful industrial country.
    Chairman Gao Gang called on all government organs to earnestly implement the various systems stipulated in the economy measures, and should think of more ways based on the situation of their own departments to practice economy in all aspects. (Northeast Daily)

    【本报讯】东北人民政府于十一月二十八日上午召开第二十次行政会议，讨论东北一级机关节约和生活制度问题。会上由东北一级机关生活制度审查委员会主任、东北人民政府秘书长栗又文首先发言，他指出：为了响应毛主席增产节约的号召和执行高岗主席的指示，为了严格生活制度，厉行节约，已对东北一级机关现行生活制度进行了彻底的检查和研究，拟定了“东北一级机关节约办法”。栗又文秘书长继对办法中规定的房屋使用、修建设备、水电消耗、办公杂支、干部生活、汽车使用、开会招待、人员调动、勤杂人员、保姆、家属等项均加以说明。
    在讨论中，与会委员对机关节约办法均一致赞成。
    高岗主席在总结发言中指出：毛主席号召增产节约，是为了把我们的国家建设成为一个富强的国家，关键就是建立强大的工业，只有这样，才能增强国防力量，有力地反对帝国主义的侵略，争取抗美援朝的胜利，巩固人民民主专政，逐步地改善人民物质生活。这是现在一切工作的重点，是全中国人民的中心任务。各部门应深刻体会毛主席的思想，学习毛主席的节约精神，发扬艰苦朴素的优良革命传统。领导同志应认真进行检查，教育人民，教育干部切实进行节约，以便积累资金，投向工业生产，把我们的国家建设成最强大的工业国。
    高岗主席号召各机关认真执行节约办法所规定的各项制度，并应根据本部门情况多想办法，从各方面进行节约。    （东北日报）
    【本报讯】华东军政委员会十二月四日举行第八十六次行政会议，研究机关节约问题。
    会议讨论并通过了华东增产节约委员会曾山兼主任提出的工矿企业增产节约方案、各级政府机关精简节约方案及华东一级机关编制方案等三个方案。华东各级机关节约方案是根据不妨碍工作和工作人员健康的原则制订的。方案分为：（一）严格执行供给标准；（二）清理资财，节约开支；（三）建立经费检查监督制度，严明奖惩等三大项。
    会议并决定了“华东一级机关干部居住公有宿舍、使用公有汽车的暂行办法”。这一办法实施的结果，将使华东一级机关在宿舍和汽车的使用方面，节省不少开支，汽车一项可由原有的一百二十辆减为五十余辆。    （解放日报）
