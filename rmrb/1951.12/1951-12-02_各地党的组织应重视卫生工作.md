Party Life Commentary

    Party Organizations in All Regions Should Emphasize Hygiene Work
    Communist Party members must care about the health of the masses; however, some comrades treat hygiene work as solely the responsibility of hygiene workers, not as a task of the Party. Some even consider disease prevention as troublesome, believing that spending manpower, materials, and financial resources on preventing epidemics is a "waste," without understanding that doing a good job in hygiene and disease prevention is a huge undertaking in increasing production and practicing economy. Some comrades even retain feudalistic, superstitious, and unscientific ideas, disbelieving in the significant role of hygiene and disease prevention work. In some individual places, many people died due to the prevalence of infectious diseases, and reactionary secret societies and special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors and cause trouble, while the local Party and government leaders were at a loss and did not report to higher authorities. In some places, Party and government organs even sent the few available hygiene workers to carry out tasks such as grain requisitioning. These thoughts and practices are all wrong. Party organizations at all levels should regard hygiene work as one of their important tasks. It should be pointed out that the losses in manpower, livestock, and economy suffered by the people of the whole country every year due to lack of hygiene knowledge and hygiene work may exceed the losses suffered by the people of the whole country every year from various disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and pests. Therefore, hygiene work should at least be regarded as equal to disaster relief and prevention work, and it should never be treated with a dismissive attitude.
    In the past, the Party committees in many places did not pay enough attention to hygiene work or did not regard hygiene work as one of the Party's tasks at all. This should be considered a major shortcoming in the Party's work. From now on, Party organizations in all regions must regard hygiene, disease prevention, general medical work, and the training and education of hygiene cadres as a major political task so that this work can be rapidly developed.

    各地党的组织应重视卫生工作
    共产党员必须关心群众健康；但有些同志却把卫生工作只当作是卫生工作人员的事，而不认为是党的工作；还有人认为防疫是多事，认为因预防疾疫而花费许多人力、物力、财力是一种“浪费”，而不懂得做好卫生防疫工作乃是一项巨大的增产节约工作；有的同志甚至残存着封建迷信的、非科学的思想，不相信卫生防疫工作的巨大作用。个别地方因疫病流行死了许多人，反动会道门、特务分子乘机造谣生事，当地党政领导干部束手无策，也不向上级报告。有的地方党政机关甚至把仅有的卫生工作人员派出去作征粮等工作。这些思想和做法都是错误的。各级党的组织应当把卫生工作当作自己的重要工作之一。应当指出：全国人民每年因缺乏卫生知识和卫生工作所受到的人力、畜力和经济上的损失可能超过全国人民每年所受水、旱、风、虫各项灾害的损失。因此至少要将卫生工作和救灾防灾工作同等看待，而决不可对它采取轻视的态度。
    过去许多地方的党委对于卫生工作不够注意或者根本不把卫生工作当作党的工作之一，应该认为这是党的工作中的一个重大缺点。今后，各地党的组织必须把卫生、防疫和一般医疗工作、卫生干部培养教育工作当作一项重大的政治任务，使这个工作得以迅速发展。
