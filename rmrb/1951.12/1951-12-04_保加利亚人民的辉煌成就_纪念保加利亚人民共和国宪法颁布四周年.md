    The Brilliant Achievements of the Bulgarian People
    --Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria

    December 4th is the fourth anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The new people's democratic constitution passed by Bulgaria in 1947 is the victorious result of the Bulgarian people's long struggle for freedom, independence, people's democracy and a happy life. It reflects the profound changes that have taken place in all aspects of Bulgaria's domestic political, social, and economic structure since the overthrow of fascist reactionary rule, and it defines Bulgaria's path towards socialism. In the four years since the promulgation of the constitution, the Bulgarian people have consolidated and developed the victories they have achieved on the road to people's democracy.

    The new era in Bulgarian history began with the victory of the anti-fascist uprising on September 9, 1944. This uprising, which was launched with the powerful support of the Soviet army's victorious offensive, liberated Bulgaria from the enslavement of the German occupiers; the fascist regime was overthrown, and the people's government led by the Fatherland Front was established. Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people crushed the counter-revolutionary activities of the reactionaries supported by foreign imperialists, held a national referendum on the abolition of the monarchy on September 8, 1946, and held elections to the National Assembly on October 27, 1946, under the slogan of "Striving for a Democratic Constitution". In this election, they elected a National Assembly composed of communists, democratic parties, and democratic figures to formulate a new constitution. On December 4, 1947, the National Assembly, executing the will of the people, unanimously passed Bulgaria's fundamental law – the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria – by roll-call vote.

    The Constitution stipulates that Bulgaria is a people's democratic republic, and all power is generated by and belongs to the people. All power is exercised by representative organs elected by citizens through universal, equal, and direct elections with secret ballots.

    All citizens of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, except those deprived of civil and political rights, who are over the age of eighteen, regardless of gender, nationality, religious belief, education, occupation, social status, and property status, have the right to vote and be elected, and have the right to remove incompetent representatives. In the National Assembly elections held on December 18, 1949, in accordance with the constitution, 98.89 percent of the voters exercised their rights. Among them, 97.66 percent of the voters voted in favor of the candidates for National Assembly deputies nominated by the Fatherland Front, fully demonstrating their support for the people's democratic system and their support for the Bulgarian Communist Party, which leads them towards socialism.

    The Constitution establishes the new foundation of Bulgaria's social and economic structure. Means of production within the People's Republic of Bulgaria are owned by the state, cooperatives, and private individuals (natural or legal persons). All natural resources, means of transportation, postal and telecommunications services are the property of the state, that is, the property of the whole people. The property of the whole people is the main pillar of the country's economic development and is specially protected by the Constitution. Private property acquired through labor and savings is also protected by the Constitution. The Constitution stipulates that, based on the interests of the state and society, individual industrial, transportation, trade, banking, and social insurance enterprises may be nationalized in whole or in part. After the promulgation of the Constitution, Bulgaria implemented industrial nationalization in December 1947, nationalizing large and medium-sized industries, power stations, mines, etc. By the end of 1948, state-owned industry accounted for 94 percent of all industry, and its output accounted for more than 97 percent of total industrial production.

    The Constitution stipulates that land belongs to the working peasants, and the state rewards and supports the development of agricultural cooperatives and provides special protection. With the help of the Bulgarian government through methods such as reducing and exempting taxes, providing loans, supplying seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery, as of October 15, 1951, Bulgarian peasants had established 2,725 agricultural cooperatives, which together owned 53.3 percent of the country's farmers and 47.5 percent of the cultivated land. In order to supply agricultural cooperatives with agricultural machinery, 117 machine tractor stations have been established nationwide.

    The Constitution stipulates that the state economic plan guides all state, cooperative, and private economic activities to ensure the rational development of the national economy and to improve the people's welfare. The two-year plan implemented from 1947 to 1948 enabled Bulgaria not only to recover from the wounds of war, but also to increase total industrial output by 71.5 percent above the pre-war level, heavy industry by 123 percent above the pre-war level, and total agricultural output in 1948 had already exceeded the pre-war level. The five-year plan that began in 1949 will lay the foundation for socialism in Bulgaria, shifting the ratio of Bulgarian industrial production to agricultural production from 30 to 70 in 1948 to 45 to 55 in 1953. The Bulgarian people have achieved significant successes in the two years of implementing the five-year plan. In 1949, the industrial production plan was completed by 107 percent, and total industrial output increased by 30 percent compared with 1948. In 1950, total industrial output increased by another 23.3 percent compared with 1949, and increased by two and a half times compared with 1939. Some achievements have also been made in agriculture. It is expected that this year's industrial production will reach 97 percent of the target set by the five-year plan for 1953; agricultural production will increase by 44 percent compared with 1950.

    The Constitution stipulates that the people have the right to work, the right to rest, and the right to receive pensions, relief funds, and old-age pensions. The unemployment that could not be eliminated in the era of bourgeois-landlord rule has been eliminated in 1949. The five-year plan stipulates that the number of workers and staff in 1953 will increase by 17 percent compared with 1948. The material well-being of the working people has been greatly improved. This year, 150,000 workers enjoyed paid leave. Since the nationalization of industry in December 1947, the social insurance funds allocated by various state-owned enterprises for workers' medical expenses, pensions, and disability allowances are equivalent to 12.5 percent of the wage fund.

    The Constitution stipulates that the people have the right to education. Now all children in Bulgaria can receive national education, and there are more than 1.2 million students in schools at all levels. The state uses all means to help the working people learn culture. Bulgarian universities have set up special classes for workers, and in the 1950-1951 academic year, 2,000 shock workers entered universities, and 34 night middle schools were opened for workers in this academic year.

    The Constitution guarantees that women enjoy equal rights with men in political, economic, social, and cultural life. Currently, there are 37 women deputies in the Bulgarian National Assembly, more than 5,000 women jurors and members of people's committees at all levels, and 42 women have received the Dimitrov Prize. Women working in state-owned enterprises and agricultural cooperatives receive special care from the state. There are now 24 times more nurseries in Bulgaria than before the war, and the number of rural maternity hospitals has increased from 6 in 1944 to 547.

    The Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is a summary of the brilliant victories that the Bulgarian people have already won on the road to people's democracy, and it is also a powerful guarantee for the Bulgarian people to further strive for greater achievements. The Constitution codifies the victories of the Bulgarian people in legislative form and embodies their will to advance towards socialism. The Bulgarian people, united around the Communist Party and the People's Government, love their happy life and bright future, and they are always ready to fulfill their glorious duty of defending their motherland and defending world peace.

    保加利亚人民的辉煌成就
    ——纪念保加利亚人民共和国宪法颁布四周年
    十二月四日是保加利亚人民共和国宪法颁布四周年纪念日。保加利亚一九四七年通过的人民民主的新宪法，是保加利亚人民在争取自由独立、争取人民民主和幸福生活的长期斗争中赢得的胜利成果。它反映了保加利亚推翻了法西斯反动统治以后，在国内政治、社会和经济结构各方面发生的深刻变化，并确定了保加利亚向社会主义前进的道路。在宪法颁布以来的四年中，保加利亚人民，已经巩固并发展了他们在人民民主的道路上取得的胜利。
    保加利亚历史上的新时代，是从一九四四年九月九日的反法西斯起义的胜利开始的。这个在苏军的胜利攻势的有力支援下举行的起义，使保加利亚从德国占领者的奴役下获得了自由独立；法西斯政权被推翻了，祖国阵线领导的人民政府建立了。在保加利亚共产党的领导下，保加利亚人民粉碎了外国帝国主义者所支持的反动派的反革命活动，在一九四六年九月八日举行了废除君主制度的全民投票，并在一九四六年十月二十七日在“争取民主宪法”的口号下举行了国民议会选举。他们在这次选举中选出了由共产党人和民主党派与民主人士组成国民议会，制订新宪法。一九四七年十二月四日，国民议会执行着人民的意志，以记名投票一致通过了保加利亚的根本法——保加利亚人民共和国宪法。
    宪法规定保加利亚是人民民主的共和国，全部政权由人民产生并属于人民。一切权力都由在普遍、平等和直接选举的基础上举行公民秘密投票产生的代表机关行使之。
    保加利亚人民共和国的一切公民，除被褫夺公民权利和政治权利者外，凡年在十八岁以上，不分性别、民族、宗教信仰、教育、职业、社会地位和财产状况，都享有选举权和被选举权，对不称职的代表可行使罢免权。在一九四九年十二月十八日按照宪法举行的国民议会选举中，百分之九十八点八九的选民行使了他们的权利。其中有百分之九十七点六六的选民投票拥护祖国阵线提出的国民议会议员候选人，充分表明了他们拥护人民民主制度，拥护领导他们向社会主义前进的保加利亚共产党。
    宪法确定了保加利亚社会和经济结构的新的基础。保加利亚人民共和国内的生产手段，属于国家、合作社、私人（自然人或法人）所有。一切自然资源、运输工具、邮政和电讯事业，都是国家的财产，即全民的财产。全民财产是国家发展国民经济的主要支柱，受到宪法的特别保护。私人因劳动和储蓄所得的财产也得到宪法的保护。宪法规定根据国家和社会的利益，得全部或部分地把个别的工业、运输、贸易、银行和社会保险企业收归国有。宪法颁布以后，保加利亚在一九四七年十二月实施了工业国有化，把大、中等工业，动力站、矿山等收归国有。到一九四八年年底，国营工业已占全部工业的百分之九十四，它的生产量则占全部工业生产的百分之九十七以上。
    宪法规定土地属于劳动农民，国家奖励扶助农业合作社的发展并予以特别的保护。在保加利亚政府用减免捐税，发放贷款、供给种子、肥料和农业机器等方法的帮助下，到一九五一年十月十五日为止，保加利亚农民已建立了二千七百二十五个农业合作社，这些合作社共拥有全国百分之五十三点三的农户和百分之四十七点五的耕地。为了供应农业合作社以农业机器，全国已经建立了一百一十七个机器拖拉机站。
    宪法确定以国家经济计划指导一切国家的、合作社的和私人的经济活动，以保证国民经济的合理发展和增进人民福利。一九四七年到一九四八年实行的两年计划，使保加利亚不仅恢复了战争的创伤，并且使工业总产量超过战前水平的百分之七十一点五，重工业超过战前水平的百分之一百二十三，农业总产量在一九四八年已超过了战前水平。一九四九年开始实行的五年计划，将为保加利亚奠定社会主义的基础，使保加利亚工业生产和农业生产的比率，由一九四八年的三十比七十变为一九五三年的四十五比五十五。保加利亚人民在实行五年计划的两年中已获得了重大的成就。一九四九年工业生产计划完成百分之一百零七，工业总产量比一九四八年增加了百分之三十。一九五○年工业总产量又比一九四九年增加百分之二十三点三，比一九三九年增加了两倍半。农业方面也获得了若干的成就。预计今年的工业生产将达到五年计划为一九五三年规定的目标的百分之九十七；农业生产将比一九五○年增加百分之四十四。
    宪法规定人民享有劳动权、休息权，并享有领受恤金、救济金和养老津贴的权利。在资产阶级——地主统治时代所无法消除的失业状态已在一九四九年消灭了。五年计划规定一九五三年的工人职员数目，将比一九四八年增加百分之十七。劳动人民的物质福利已大为增进。今年享有工资照付的休假的工人有十五万人。从一九四七年十二月工业国有化以来，各国营企业拨作工人医疗费、养老金、丧失工作能力的津贴之用的社会保险基金，等于工资基金的百分之十二点五。
    宪法确定人民有受教育的权利。现在保加利亚所有的儿童都可以受到国民教育，各级学校的学生有一百二十多万人。国家用一切办法帮助劳动人民学习文化。保加利亚的各大学都为工人设立了特别班，在一九五○——一九五一学年中有二千个突击工人进入大学，这一学年又为工人开办了三十四所夜中学。
    宪法保障妇女在政治、经济、社会和文化生活中享有和男子同等的权利。现在保加利亚国民议会议员中有三十七位是妇女，陪审员和各级地方人民委员会的委员中有五千多位是妇女，有四十二个妇女得到季米特洛夫奖金。在国营企业和农业合作社工作的妇女，受到国家的特别照顾。保加利亚的托儿所现在已比战前增加了二十四倍，乡村的产科医院已从一九四四年的六所增加到五百四十七所。
    保加利亚人民共和国宪法是保加利亚人民在人民民主道路上已经赢得的光辉胜利的总结，也是保加利亚人民进一步争取更大成就的有力的保证。宪法以立法手续确定了保加利亚人民的胜利，并体现了他们向社会主义前进的意志。团结在共产党和人民政府周围的保加利亚人民，热爱他们的幸福生活和美好的将来，他们随时准备克尽他们的保卫祖国，保卫世界和平的光荣天职。
