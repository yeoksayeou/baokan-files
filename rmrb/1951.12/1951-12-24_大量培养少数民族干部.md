    Vigorously Cultivate Minority Cadres
      Ye Shangzhi
    (I)
    Since the liberation of various regions across the country, governments at all levels have attached great importance to cultivating minority cadres. As of now, excluding minority cadres and students who are currently undergoing training, more than 50,000 minority cadres have been trained nationwide, having been released from production. This is an important reason for the significant achievements made in ethnic work over the past two years; it is also a good condition for the widespread implementation of regional autonomy and the development of the political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings of various ethnic minorities in the future.
    Over the past two years, various regions have adopted various methods to cultivate minority cadres. The main methods include running short-term training courses, cultivating cadres in practical work, and establishing regular ethnic schools.
        (II)
    Running short-term training courses is the best way to cultivate a large number of ethnic minority cadres. Relevant special districts and counties have run various types of short-term training courses, especially those focused on politics, and have gained some important experience.
    Ethnic cadre training courses must first and foremost conscientiously conduct education on ethnic policies. To this end, it is necessary not only to increase the weight of ethnic policy education in formal courses, but also to thoroughly implement ethnic policies in various specific facilities of the school. The leading cadres of the training course (especially Han cadres) must first study ethnic policies well and practice them diligently. Prevent the emergence of various forms of Han chauvinism (especially remnants of Han chauvinist ideology), and prevent violations of ethnic policies. The trainees in the training courses come from different ethnic groups and various places, and their political and cultural levels are very different, with each having its own unique psychological emotions. Therefore, it is necessary to first pay attention to the issue of unity. In the event of ethnic discrimination and disputes, they should be resolved from a fair standpoint, and education on ethnic equality and ethnic unity should be carried out. In terms of teaching, it is necessary to follow the mass line, promote and assign minority cadres to participate in the work of the training courses, and even participate in leadership work. Contact and educate the vast number of trainees through them. When lecturing or talking, avoid stimulating the ethnic and religious sentiments of minority cadres. Respect their living habits and religious beliefs, and provide practical care (such as setting up separate kitchens for trainees and cadres who believe in Islam). Think of them in every way, be considerate and meticulous, so that they trust the leadership and create an atmosphere of unity from top to bottom, ethnic equality, mutual assistance, and fraternal love.
    In order to stimulate the political consciousness of the trainees, the training course should use the history of the ethnic minorities themselves, combined with the history of the people of the whole country, to conduct education on the struggle between the two political lines of revolution and counter-revolution. Enable them to understand from historical facts the crimes of cruel oppression of ethnic minorities by the reactionary rulers of all dynasties, especially the Kuomintang's Han chauvinist reactionary rulers, and arouse their hatred for the Kuomintang bandits and ethnic traitors who colluded with imperialism and the Kuomintang; make them realize the correctness of the political line of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, thereby loving and supporting the Chinese Communist Party, the savior of all ethnic groups in China, and Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China. In this way, the ethnic estrangement caused by the reactionary rule of past dynasties can be broken, and ethnic unity can be achieved to jointly build the great family of the people of all ethnic groups—the People's Republic of China. When conducting such education, it is necessary to deeply understand the ideological situation and psychological characteristics of the trainees in order to determine the key points of teaching. Many training courses have used the method of "speaking out bitterness" to conduct education, which has greatly improved the political consciousness of the trainees.
    The teaching work of the training course should be closely linked with the current political struggles and practical work. When formulating the teaching plan, it is necessary to fully estimate the current political tasks and practical work needs of various ethnic minority areas, and regard guiding trainees to participate in these practical work as an important educational step. Some effective methods in certain places, such as organizing trainees to visit cities, factories, and exhibitions, or participate in demonstrations and donation movements to resist US aggression and aid Korea, organizing publicity in the countryside, visiting people in ethnic minority areas, and even participating in local work, such as anti-local tyrant, rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and democratic regime building, can be flexibly adopted according to specific circumstances.
    In order to make it easier for ethnic minority trainees to understand the content of the course, the teaching methods should be diverse and more emphasis placed on visual education. Prevent mechanically copying the educational methods of Han areas, or carrying big books and giving big reports, without regard to the characteristics of ethnic minority trainees.
    The people of ethnic minorities are generally good at singing and dancing and like sports and games. Therefore, literary and artistic activities should be organized frequently in order to stabilize the emotions of the trainees and make the learning life more lively; and literary and artistic activities should be used to enrich the teaching content and improve the teaching effect.
        (III)
    The experience of the past two years has proved that it is very important to systematically select and cultivate minority cadres in practical work and in broad mass movements. Many ethnic cadres have been trained in the movements to suppress bandits, oppose local tyrants, reduce rent, collect grain, resist US aggression and aid Korea, and suppress counter-revolutionaries. In some places, ethnic minority cadres are cultivated through the work of building ethnic democratic regimes, seeking out leaders who have contact with the masses, representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, and activists, and cultivating them to become cadres. This requires the leadership of the relevant areas to boldly use, specifically help, warmly unite, and patiently cultivate minority cadres. Local ethnic cadres are connected to the local ethnic people, can speak the language of the ethnic group, and understand the affairs of the ethnic group. They should be allowed to work freely and boldly used so that they have positions and powers, so that they can serve the people of their ethnic group wholeheartedly with the attitude of masters. Do not be impatient to help and cultivate, or even despise, some minority cadres because of their low level of education and lack of experience. When assigning tasks to minority cadres, the tasks must be explained clearly, the work methods must be taught to them, and their work enthusiasm must be encouraged. When the work comes to an end, they must be helped to summarize the work. This will give full play to their work enthusiasm and ensure that they make achievements in the implementation of policies, without causing problems due to free use and bold promotion. It is sometimes unavoidable that some minority cadres make certain shortcomings or mistakes in their work. This requires patiently helping them to recognize and correct these mistakes, and it is not appropriate to criticize them impatiently. We must pay attention to their achievements, care about their progress, and constantly educate them. We must prevent the simple utilitarian view of not educating, not helping, not cherishing, and not respecting. When conditions permit, after a considerable period of work, the opportunity for rotational training should be given to improve their political and professional level.
        (IV)
    Over the past two years, work has also been carried out to train ethnic cadres in regular ethnic schools. The central government and relevant major administrative regions and provinces have established ethnic colleges and a number of ethnic cadre schools. Many ordinary middle schools and universities in relevant areas have also opened their doors to ethnic minorities. Some of the difficulties encountered by ethnic minority students in enrollment have been appropriately resolved. For example, Peking University has specially set up a medical preparatory class for ethnic minority students, so that they can successfully enter undergraduate studies after learning Chinese and making up for their education. In addition, ethnic minority students have also been selected among students studying abroad. In September of this year, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a national ethnic education work conference, and made important resolutions on ethnic minority education. This provides a strong guarantee for the cultivation of intellectuals and specialized talents of various ethnic minorities in the future. A large number of ethnic minority intellectuals must be cultivated. Only in this way can ethnic minorities gradually get rid of the backward state caused by history, carry out modernization, and achieve advanced political, economic, and cultural levels.
        (V)
    Over the past two years, great achievements have been made in the work of cultivating minority cadres. However, in terms of the needs of the work, the ethnic cadres who have been trained are obviously not enough, whether in terms of quantity or quality. The number of cadres needed by various ethnic minorities in China is not just tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands. It is not only necessary to have general, primary-level cadres, but also middle-level, senior-level cadres and various specialized talents. Ethnic work has been fully launched, especially the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy is about to be widely promoted in ethnic minority areas, which requires a large number of ethnic cadres. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the current achievements in the slightest, but must adhere to the general policy of "universally and extensively cultivating ethnic cadres" as instructed by the State Council of the Central People's Government in the "Trial Implementation Plan for Cultivating Ethnic Minority Cadres," and continue to strengthen the work of cultivating ethnic cadres. Therefore, we must promote the good experiences of cultivating ethnic minority cadres over the past two years. The relevant areas, especially the special districts and counties, should still focus on running short-term training courses, while simultaneously stepping up the cultivation of ethnic minority cadres through practical work and through regular schools.
    In order to carry out this work in a more planned manner, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres. The relevant departments should cooperate, adopt appropriate organizational forms, formulate plans, raise funds, supervise and inspect, exchange experiences, and allocate cadres. The competent departments should have a division of labor in leading the relevant schools and training courses. The tasks and admission targets of the schools and training courses run by governments at all levels should also have a division of labor in order to overcome some of the duplication and confusion in the work of cultivating ethnic cadres. While strengthening leadership, we must also pay attention to giving play to the initiative of various professional systems and lower-level governments in the work of cultivating and training ethnic minority cadres. Only in this way can this work be done better.

    大量培养少数民族干部
      叶尚志（一）
    全国各地相继解放后，各级人民政府都很重视培养少数民族干部。截至目前为止，除正在训练的少数民族在职干部和学员外，全国已经培养出来的脱离生产的少数民族干部有五万多人。这是两年来民族工作获得巨大成绩的重要原因；也是今后普遍推行区域自治和发展各少数民族的政治、经济、文化教育事业的良好条件。
    两年来，各地曾采取各种方式培养少数民族干部。其中主要的是开办短期训练班，在实际工作中培养和开办正规的民族学校。
        （二）
    开办短期训练班，是大量培养民族干部的最好方式。有关的专区和县，曾开办了各种性质的、特别是政治的短期训练班，并获得了一些重要的经验。
    民族干部训练班，首先必须认真进行民族政策的教育。为此，不仅须要在正式课程中加重民族政策教育的分量，而且须要在学校的各种具体设施上，很好地贯彻民族政策。训练班的领导干部（尤其是汉族干部），首先要学好民族政策，并且身体力行。防止各种可能出现的大民族主义（尤其大汉族主义思想残余），防止违反民族政策的现象发生。训练班的学员，民族成份不同，来自各个地方，政治、文化水平也极不一样，心理感情各有特点，因此必须首先注意团结问题。遇有民族之间的歧视和纠纷，应站在公正立场加以解决，并借此进行民族平等、民族团结的教育。在教学方面，要走群众路线，要提拔和配备少数民族的干部参加训练班的工作，以至参加领导工作。通过他们去联系和教育广大的学员。讲课或谈话时要避免刺激少数民族干部的民族情感和宗教情感。要尊重他们的生活习惯和宗教信仰，并予以实际的照顾（如信仰伊斯兰教的学员和干部应另立炉灶等）。要处处为他们设想，体贴入微，使他们信赖领导，造成上下团结、民族平等、互助友爱的空气。
    为了启发学员的政治自觉性，训练班应用少数民族自己的历史，结合全国人民的历史，进行关于革命和反革命两条政治路线斗争的教育。使他们从历史事实中，来了解历代的反动统治者，尤其是国民党大汉族主义反动统治者，对少数民族残酷压迫的罪恶，激发他们对国民党匪帮及勾结帝国主义和国民党的本民族叛徒的仇恨；使他们认识中国共产党、毛主席的政治路线的正确性，从而热爱和拥护中国各民族人民的救星中国共产党和中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席。这样就可以打破历代反动统治所造成的民族隔阂，达到民族团结，共同建设各民族人民的大家庭——中华人民共和国。在进行这样的教育时，必须深入了解学员的思想情况和心理特点，以便确定教学重点。许多训练班曾通过诉苦方式进行教育，大大地提高了学员的政治觉悟。
    训练班的教学工作，要和当前的政治斗争、实际工作紧密联系起来。在制定教学计划时，要充分估计到各民族地区当前的政治任务和实际工作的需要，并把引导学员参加这些实际工作当作重要的教育步骤。某些地方行之有效的一些办法，如组织学员到城市、工厂、展览会参观，或参加抗美援朝示威游行和捐献运动，组织下乡宣传，访问少数民族地区人民，甚至参加当地的工作，如反恶霸、减租减息和民主政权建设工作等，都可以根据具体情况灵活采用。
    为了使少数民族学员容易了解课程的内容，教学方法要多样，多采取形象教育。防止不顾少数民族学员的特点，机械地搬用汉族地区的教育方法，或者搬大书本，做大报告等。
    少数民族人民大都能歌善舞，喜好运动游戏，因此应经常组织文艺活动，以便安定学员的情绪，并使学习生活更加活泼；并通过文艺活动丰富教学内容，提高教学效果。
        （三）
    两年来的经验证明：在实际工作中，在广泛的群众运动中，有计划地选拔、培养少数民族干部是很重要的。许多民族干部是从剿匪、反恶霸、减租、征粮、抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动中培养出来的。有些地方，是通过民族民主政权建设工作，物色和群众有联系的领袖人物、各族各界代表和积极分子，加以培养，使之成为干部。这就要求有关地区的领导方面对少数民族干部大胆使用，具体帮助，热忱团结，耐心培养。当地的民族干部和本民族人民群众有联系，能说本民族的话，懂本民族的事，应放手让他们工作，大胆使用他们，使其有职有权，这样他们才能以主人翁的态度，全心全意地为本民族人民服务。不要因某些少数民族干部文化水平低、经验少而不耐心帮助、培养，甚或轻视他们。对少数民族干部布置工作时，要把任务讲得清清楚楚，教给他们以工作方法，鼓励他们的工作情绪，工作告一段落时，要帮助他们总结工作。这样就会发挥他们的工作积极性，保证他们在执行政策中做出成绩，不致因放手使用、大胆提拔而发生问题。少数民族干部在工作中发生某些缺点或错误，有时是不可避免的。这需要耐心地帮助他们认识并改正这些错误，不宜急躁地进行批评。要重视他们的成绩，关心他们的进步，时时进行教育。要防止不教育，不帮助，不爱惜，不尊重的单纯使用观点。在条件许可时，经过相当时期的工作，要给以轮训的机会，以提高他们的政治水平和业务水平。
        （四）
    两年来，在正规的民族学校中，培养民族干部的工作也已开展。中央及有关大行政区和省已开办了民族学院及若干民族干部学校。许多有关地区的普通中学和高等学校，也已向少数民族开了门。少数民族学生入学所碰到的若干困难，已经得到了适当解决。如北京大学专为少数民族学生附设了一个医科补习班，使他们在学习汉语和补习文化以后，能够顺利地升入本科学习。此外，在出国学生中，也选派了少数民族同学。今年九月，中央人民政府教育部召开全国民族教育工作会议，关于少数民族教育，也作出了重要的决议。对今后培养各少数民族的知识分子和专门人材，提供了有力的保证。少数民族的知识分子必须大量地培养出来。只有如此，少数民族才能逐步摆脱历史上所造成的落后状态，进行现代化的建设，达到先进的政治、经济、文化的水平。
        （五）
    两年来，培养少数民族干部的工作，已获得很大成绩。但就工作的需要来说，已经培养出来的民族干部，无论在数量上、质量上显然还是不够的。国内各少数民族所需要的干部不只是几万，而是几十万。不只是需要一般的、初级的干部，更需要中级的、高级的干部和各种专门人材。民族工作已经全面展开，尤其是民族区域自治即将在少数民族地区普遍推行，这就需要大批的民族干部。因此，丝毫不能满足于现在的成绩，而必须坚持中央人民政府政务院在“培养少数民族干部试行方案”中所指示的“普遍而大量地培养少数民族干部”的总方针，继续加强培养民族干部的工作。因此，必须推广两年来培养少数民族干部的良好经验。各有关地区，尤其是专区和县仍应以开办短期训练班的方式为主，同时通过实际工作，通过正规学校，加紧培养少数民族干部。
    为使这一工作更有计划地进行，必须加强培养少数民族干部工作的领导。各有关部门要配合起来，采取适当的组织形式，制定计划，筹划经费，督促检查，交流经验，分配干部。各主管部门在领导有关学校、训练班的责任上应有分工。各级政府所办的学校和训练班的任务和吸收对象上，也应该有分工，以克服在培养民族干部工作中某些重复和混乱的现象。和加强领导同时，又要注意发挥各专业系统及下级政府在培养和训练少数民族干部工作中的主动性。只有这样，才能把这一工作做得更好。
