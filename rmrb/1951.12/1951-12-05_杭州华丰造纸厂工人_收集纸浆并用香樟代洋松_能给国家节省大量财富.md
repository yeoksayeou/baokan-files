    Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill Workers
    Collect Pulp and Use Camphor to Substitute Imported Pine
    Saving the Country a Large Amount of Wealth
    Workers at Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill are actively responding to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and economy. The wastewater from the paper screening machines in the second and third workshops of the mill was smelly and dirty. Since the factory opened, no one had paid attention to it. However, this time, the workers, unafraid of the filth, discovered that the wastewater contained a lot of fiber. After collecting it, they can recover pulp worth over one million yuan every day. For example, in the carpentry workshop, they used to use imported pine for making pulp pipes for releasing pulp. Imported pine costs 25,000 yuan per foot, and the material supply was also difficult. Therefore, the workers in the carpentry workshop used their brains and replaced the imported pine with camphor wood (camphor tree). In this way, the produced pulp pipes are not only more durable than those made of imported pine because camphor is not easily corroded and has no cracks; moreover, camphor wood costs only 8,000 yuan per foot. If we calculate the annual demand of 10,000 feet, statistics show that 170 million yuan can be saved.    Chen Weimin

    杭州华丰造纸厂工人
    收集纸浆并用香樟代洋松
    能给国家节省大量财富
    杭州华丰造纸厂工人积极响应毛主席的增产节约的号召。该厂二、三厂纸间筛浆机下面的废水又臭又污，自开厂以来，从没有人去注意它；但此次工人们不怕污秽，竟发现在废水里包含很多纤维，经过收集后，每天可收到价值一百余万元的纸浆。又如该厂木匠间以前做放浆用的浆管子时，都要用外国的洋松，洋松每尺要二万五千元，并且材料供应也很困难。于是，木匠间工人开动脑筋，把洋松改用香樟（樟树）来代替。这样，制成的浆管子不但因香樟不易腐烂与没有裂缝，比洋松更经久耐用；而且，香樟每尺只要八千元，每年若以需用一万尺计算，统计可节省一亿七千万元。    陈维民
