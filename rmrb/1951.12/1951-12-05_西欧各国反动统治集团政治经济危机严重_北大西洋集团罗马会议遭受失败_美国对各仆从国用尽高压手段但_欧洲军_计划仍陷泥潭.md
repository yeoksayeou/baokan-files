(New China News Agency, December 4th) Rome dispatch: The eighth meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, long prepared for by the United States, was held in Rome, the capital of Italy, from November 24th to 28th. The United States originally hoped to pass many of the war preparation plans that were postponed at the Ottawa meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council two and a half months ago at this meeting, but the result was a more miserable failure than at the Ottawa meeting. The United Press International openly acknowledged in a dispatch from Rome on the day the meeting ended: "After five days of meetings, the final communique revealed that there were more failures than progress in reaching agreements or final decisions." In UPI's reports on previous meetings of the North Atlantic Group Council, this was an unprecedentedly low-key tone.

Given the lessons of the failure at the Ottawa meeting, the United States had carried out many activities in the past two and a half months, exercising great pressure on its vassal states in an attempt to force them to accept the will of the United States at the Rome meeting. At this meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, Treasury Secretary Snyder, Defense Secretary Lovett, and the U.S. military governor in Western Europe, the so-called "Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Army" Eisenhower, and the U.S. economic governor in Western Europe, the so-called Chairman of the Provisional Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Council, Harriman, also used all means of pressure. However, the result of the Rome meeting was still a meeting that UPI considered "disappointing" because it "failed to reach any decisions on important outstanding issues."

At this meeting, the main purpose of the United States was to force its vassal states to accelerate the war preparation steps in Western Europe, to immediately establish the so-called "European Army," which has been in preparation for years but is still on paper, and to immediately organize the revived West German army into the war machine of the North Atlantic Group under the cover of the "European Army." It was precisely for this reason that Acheson loudly demanded at the meeting that the vassal states "speed up and vigorously promote" the European Army plan. Eisenhower also sternly rebuked the North Atlantic Group for "a tendency to handle military issues from a national point of view." He "sternly warned" the vassal states that they must "forget their unique national glories" and "pool their sovereignty together." However, all of this was to no avail. French Foreign Minister Schuman, who was ordered by the United States to submit a report on the European Army negotiations to the Rome meeting, had to admit in his report that the European Army "still has some issues that need to be discussed by Western European experts before an agreement can be reached, including: the European Army budget, the form and power of the supranational political organization governing the European Army, the appointment of officials, and the armaments plan." At the meeting, Britain made it clear that it still refused to participate in the European Army. British Foreign Secretary Eden publicly announced to reporters outside the meeting: "British troops will not participate in the European Army." At the same time, even the three small countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg launched a "covert rebellion" against the U.S. proposal to accelerate the establishment of the European Army, raising objections. Finally, Schuman himself admitted at a press conference on November 28th: "The European Army plan has fallen into a mire."

The reason why the North Atlantic Treaty Organization failed to reach an agreement on the European Army issue clearly demonstrates that the ruling groups in Western European countries are very afraid of the resistance of the people at home to the policy of arming West Germany and the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war. This resistance has been increasing with the severity of the economic crisis in Western European countries. According to UPI, "The Rome meeting could not find any solutions to the serious economic crisis that may be caused by the national expansion plans." At the meeting, representatives from all countries other than the United States unanimously complained that their governments could not "persuade" their people to oppose the expansion of armaments and reached out to the United States for money. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler even stated: "The deterioration of the economic balance caused by the expansion of armaments by the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be as serious as military failure." However, in the face of a chorus of complaints and begging, the United States, which itself has major financial difficulties, remains at a loss. U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder said after the meeting ended: "The U.S. delegation did not make any promises regarding the financial burden after this fiscal year." In this way, since the United States cannot meet the demands of its vassal states, the vassal states will naturally be unable to accept the orders of the United States. Therefore, according to "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger, who was sent to Rome, "In reality, the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have not undertaken new, important military obligations."

In addition to the most important issue of organizing the "European Army," many other issues that the United States wanted to resolve at the Rome meeting also failed to reach an agreement. These issues include the so-called "Middle East Command," which has been stillborn due to the opposition of the people of the Middle East and the U.S.-British struggle for leadership, the issue of whether the Supreme Naval Commander of the North Atlantic Army should be an American or a Briton, and the issue of whether the North Atlantic Army should use American rifles or British rifles as standard rifles. Regarding the latter two issues, the Military Committee meeting held on the eve of the Council meeting had already passed a resolution to appoint an American as the Naval Commander and to adopt American rifles as standard rifles. However, at the Council meeting, the British representative, on the order of British Prime Minister Churchill, raised an objection, and the U.S. proposal was therefore rejected. This was a blow to the U.S. attempt to monopolize the military institutions of the North Atlantic Group and the arms market of the North Atlantic Group.

In the face of this general situation full of contradictions and difficulties, although the communique of the Rome meeting also vaguely stated that the meeting had "exchanged views and made decisions on various military issues," even "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger said: "These things are more empty talk than they are of great significance."

The result of the Rome meeting has made the United States feel anxious. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Rome on November 29th, senior U.S. officials who attended the Rome meeting believed that they could no longer "underestimate the difficulties ahead. They said: At the just-concluded North Atlantic Conference, 'these very difficult issues' (of the European Army) have not made any progress." In fact, the gloomy scene at the Rome meeting fully proves that the result of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's frantic implementation of expanding armaments and preparing for war for the past year has accelerated the development of various internal contradictions, and it has become increasingly difficult for the United States to promote its North Atlantic war machine. Now, since the Rome meeting was fruitless, the North Atlantic Group has helplessly decided to postpone the various issues to the ninth meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council to be held in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, on February 2nd next year. However, even the United States itself is not very confident whether the next meeting can be more successful than this meeting. A UPI dispatch from Rome on November 28th revealed: "A spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization admitted that the coming 'months' are the 'critical juncture' for the organization." UPI worried that "political and military suspicions" among the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization may cause the plan to prepare for a new war to "go bankrupt."

### 西欧各国反动统治集团政治经济危机严重  北大西洋集团罗马会议遭受失败  美国对各仆从国用尽高压手段但“欧洲军”计划仍陷泥潭

    西欧各国反动统治集团政治经济危机严重
    北大西洋集团罗马会议遭受失败
    美国对各仆从国用尽高压手段但“欧洲军”计划仍陷泥潭
    【新华社四日讯】罗马消息：经过美国长期准备的北大西洋侵略集团理事会第八次会议，已于十一月二十四日至二十八日在意大利首都罗马举行。美国原来指望在这次会议上通过两个半月以前在北大西洋公约理事会渥太华会议上延搁下来的许多备战计划，但是结果却遭到了比在渥太华会议上更惨的失败。美国合众社在会议结束那天从罗马发出的电讯公开承认：“五天的会议结束后，最后公报透露：在获得协议或最后决定方面，失败的成分多于进展的成分。”在合众社关于北大西洋集团历届理事会会议的报道中，这是语调空前低沉的一次。
    鉴于在渥太华会议上失败的教训，美国在两个半月来曾进行了许多活动，对各附庸国家行使了极大的压力，企图逼迫它们在罗马会议上接受美国的意志。而在这次会议上，代表美国出席这个会议的美国国务卿艾奇逊，财政部长斯奈德，国防部长罗维特，以及美国驻西欧的军事总督、所谓“北大西洋军总司令”艾森豪威尔，美国驻西欧的经济总督、所谓北大西洋公约理事会临时委员会主席哈里曼，也都用尽了一切高压手段。但是，罗马会议结果仍然是一个使合众社认为是“令人失望”的会议，因为，它“对各项重要的未决问题没有能获得任何决定”。
    在这次会议上，美国的主要目的是想逼迫各附庸国家加速西欧的备战步骤，立即把筹备经年而至今还在纸上的所谓“欧洲军”建立起来，立即把复活中的西德军队在“欧洲军”的掩护下组织进北大西洋集团的战争机器。正是因为如此，艾奇逊在会上曾大声要求各附庸国家“火速大力推进”欧洲军计划。艾森豪威尔也严辞申斥北大西洋集团内部“有一种从国家观点出发来处理军事问题的倾向”。他“严厉警告”各仆从国家必须“忘掉各国独有的光荣”，而“把它们的主权拿出来凑在一起”。但是，所有这一切都无济于事。奉美国之命向罗马会议提出关于欧洲军谈判的报告的法国外交部长舒曼在报告中就不得不承认，欧洲军“有些问题还需要西欧的专家们加以讨论后才能获得协议，这些问题包括：欧洲军预算问题、统治欧洲军的超国家政治机构的形式和权力问题、官员的任命和军备计划问题”。在会上，英国明白表示仍然拒绝参加欧洲军，英国外交大臣艾登在会外公开向新闻记者宣布：“英国军队将不参加欧洲军。”同时，连荷兰、比利时、卢森堡三个小国都在会上对美国要求加速建立欧洲军的提案实行“暗中反叛”，提出反对意见。最后，舒曼自己也于十一月二十八日在记者招待会上承认：“欧洲军的计划已经掉进了泥潭。”
    北大西洋侵略集团之所以在欧洲军问题上无法达成协议，明显地表现了西欧各国统治集团十分害怕国内人民对武装西德政策和扩军备战政策的反抗。这种反抗已随着西欧各国经济危机的严重而日益加强。据合众社说：“罗马会议对各国扩军计划可能引起的严重经济危机不能有什么处理办法。”在会上，美国以外的各国代表一致申诉他们的政府无法“说服”他们的人民对扩张军备的反对，并向美国伸手要钱。英国财政大臣巴特勒甚至提出：“北大西洋公约机构国家由于扩军所造成的经济平衡的恶化，将和军事失败同等严重。”但是在一片诉苦声和求乞声面前，本身也有着重大财政困难的美国依然是一筹莫展。美国财政部长斯奈德在会议闭幕后说：“关于本财政年度以后的财政负担，美国代表团并没有提出任何诺言。”这样，美国既然不能满足各仆从国家的要求，各仆从国家也就当然无法接受美国的命令。因此，据“纽约时报”派赴罗马的记者苏兹贝格透露：“实际上，北大西洋公约各国并没有承担新的、重要的军事义务。”
    除了在组织“欧洲军”这样最主要的问题以外，美国想在罗马会议上解决的许多其他问题，也没有能够获得协议。这些问题中包括由于中东人民的反对以及美英争夺领导权而陷于难产的所谓“中东司令部”的问题、北大西洋军海军总司令由美国人还是英国人担任的问题、北大西洋军以美国步枪还是以英国步枪作为标准步枪的问题。关于后面两个问题，在理事会开幕前夕召开的军事委员会会议上本来已经通过了任命美国人为海军总司令以及采用美国步枪为标准步枪的决议，但是，在理事会会议上，英国代表奉英国首相邱吉尔之命提出了异议，美国的建议因此而被否决。这是对美国想垄断北大西洋集团军事机构与北大西洋集团军火市场的企图的一个打击。
    在这种充满了矛盾和困难的总的形势面前，虽然罗马会议的公报中也笼统地说会议曾就“各项军事问题交换了意见并作出了决定”。但是，连“纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格也说：“这些东西与其说具有重要意义，不如说是空话连篇。”
    罗马会议的这种结果，已使美国方面感到焦虑。据美联社罗马十一月二十九日电，出席罗马会议的美国高级官员们认为已不能再“轻视前途的困难。他们说：在刚结束的北大西洋会议上，‘（欧洲军）这些很困难的问题’并未得到什么进展”。实际上，罗马会议上的阴暗景象充分证明了北大西洋侵略集团一年来疯狂地实行扩军备战的结果，已经使它内部的各种矛盾加速发展，美国要推动其北大西洋战争机器已越来越困难。现在，由于罗马会议并无收获，北大西洋集团已无可奈何地决定把各项问题延搁到明年二月二日在葡萄牙首都里斯本举行北大西洋公约理事会第九次会议时再去解决。但是，究竟下次会议能否进行得比这次会议更顺利一点，连美国自己也没有多大把握。合众社罗马十一月二十八日电透露：“北大西洋公约组织发言人承认，未来的‘几个月’是这个组织的‘严重关头’。”合众社担心北大西洋公约国家“在政治上、军事上的猜忌”可能使准备新战争的计划“破产”。
