Xinhua News Agency, December 5th:

    After collectively joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members during the celebration of the 34th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army excitedly held widespread forums to discuss the great significance of further understanding the friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union. They also wrote letters to the headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, expressing their love for the motherland and their respect for the Soviet Union.

    The entire commanders and fighters of a rocket artillery platoon of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army wrote in their letter: The Soviet Union is the bright banner of all mankind today. Every time we think that our motherland will soon be built like the Soviet Union, and we will live a happy socialist and communist life, we will grow even more courage to defend our country and defeat the enemy. The letter from commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army wrote: After joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, we have more clearly realized that the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. We are very moved to continuously receive a large number of慰问品 [comfort items] and 慰问信 [letters of sympathy] sent by the people of the motherland. We must learn from the spirit of the Soviet elder brother to defeat the German fascists to defeat the imperialists who invade the security of the motherland.

    A letter from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, signed with names, said: The unity and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is the guarantee of defending world peace. In addition to directly打击 [striking at] the American aggressors, we must also always宣传 [publicize] the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship and Soviet peaceful policies to the masses.

   【新华社五日讯】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员，自在庆祝苏联十月革命节三十四周年时集体加入中苏友好协会为团体会员后，都兴奋地普遍举行了座谈会，讨论进一步认识中苏两国友好团结的伟大意义，并纷纷写信给中苏友好协会总会，表示他们对祖国的热爱和对苏联的崇敬。
    中国人民志愿军某部火箭炮班全体指挥员战斗员来信说：苏联是今天全人类光明的旗帜。我们每一想起祖国不久将来也要建设成像苏联一样，过社会主义、共产主义的幸福生活时，就益发增长起保家卫国战胜敌人的无限勇气。中国人民志愿军某部指挥员战斗员的来信中写道：加入中苏友好协会以后，我们更明确地认识了中国革命的胜利和苏联的帮助是分不开的。我们在这里不断收到祖国人民送来的大批慰问品、慰问信，使我们非常感动。我们要学习苏联老大哥打垮德国法西斯的精神来打垮侵犯祖国安全的帝国主义者。
    来自中国人民志愿军某部的签满了姓名的信中说：中苏两国人民的团结合作是保卫世界和平的保障。我们除直接打击美国侵略者外，一定还要随时向群众宣传中苏友谊和苏联和平政策的伟大意义。
