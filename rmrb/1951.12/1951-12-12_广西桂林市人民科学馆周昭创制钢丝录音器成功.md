    Zhou Zhao of the Guilin People's Science Museum in Guangxi
    Successfully Creates Steel Wire Recorder
    To the Editor: Zhou Zhao, a researcher at the Guilin People's Science Museum in Guangxi Province, after three months of constant research in his spare time, successfully created a domestically produced steel wire recorder. According to experimental results, the sound recorded by this recorder is very clear, almost the same as foreign products. In the past, the steel wire recorders used in our country were mostly foreign products. Calculating each unit at more than 40 million yuan, the annual expenditure was also very large. Before June of this year, Zhou Zhao, in order to combat the imperialist economic blockade, was determined to manufacture a steel wire recorder. He began experimenting in June. During the experiment, he used his evening rest time to overcome many difficulties and successfully trial-produced it in mid-September. The Culture and Education Department of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government has ordered five domestically produced steel wire recorders from the People's Science Museum. It is estimated that the cost of each unit will be about 20 million yuan, which is nearly half the price of foreign products. Lu Yikun
    Yang Shanlin, a Worker at Mine No. 1 of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau
    Heroically Rescues Six Fellow Workers and Receives Commendation
    Yang Shanlin is a coal miner at Mine No. 1 of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau and is the deputy leader of the nationally famous pneumatic pick operator Zhao Wenxin's group. At 9:00 p.m. on November 28, in the place where he was working, before the timber props were finished, the roof was about to collapse. At this time, Ma Xingzhi, Feng Shunlin, and four others were still working inside. Yang Shanlin shouted loudly: "Comrades, the roof is bad, get out quickly!" As Yang Shanlin spoke, he forgot about his own life danger and bravely jumped inside. He helped Ma Xingzhi and the others escape from danger, and at the same time used his body to resist the falling timber props, fighting with the roof. The stones and fences were all shaking. After a few minutes, he jumped out, and the timber props collapsed. Then, seven duckbill canopies and other timber props also tilted, and the roof fell with a roar. However, Yang Shanlin and the other six workers were not injured in the slightest. Yang Shanlin's heroic act not only greatly moved the workers, but also received commendation from higher authorities.

    The "Unattended Ticket Booth" at the Guilin Zijin Cinema
    Receipts and Ticket Sales Match Exactly for Two Months
    To the Editor: In order to facilitate the audience to buy tickets and watch movies, the Guilin Zijin Cinema in Guangxi has established "unattended ticket booths" in four locations in the city since National Day this year. Each location has a large round wooden sign, which briefly introduces the content of each film. A collection box is hung in the center of the sign, and the movie tickets for the first and second shows every evening are pasted on the left and right sides. The tickets have seat numbers and prices, and the ticket buyers can freely choose their seats and put the ticket money into the collection box.
    These "unattended ticket booths" have been running for nearly two months, and no discrepancies have been found between the receipts and the ticket sales, and many tickets have been sold. An elderly man named Gao Dashi, who is 76 years old and lives near the "unattended ticket booth" at the Jiefang Bridge, said: "I have lived for more than seventy years and have never seen such a good moral atmosphere. This new morality of the new society only exists under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government." Geng Xin

    广西桂林市人民科学馆周昭
    创制钢丝录音器成功
    编辑同志：广西省桂林市人民科学馆研究员周昭，经过三个月工余时间的不断钻研，创制国产钢丝录音器成功。根据实验结果，这个录音器所录的声音非常清晰，和外来货差不多。我国以前所用的钢丝录音器，大多是外国货，拿每架四千多万元计算，每年的支出也是很大的。今年六月前，周昭为了打击帝国主义的经济封锁，就决心要制造一架钢丝录音器。六月间他着手进行试验。在试验过程中，他利用晚上休息的时间，克服了不少的困难，在九月中旬试制成功。广西省人民政府文教厅已向人民科学馆订制国产钢丝录音器五部，据估计，每部成本约需二千多万元，较外国货价格降低将近一半。陆义锟

    英勇抢救六个工友受到表扬
    杨山林是峰峰矿务局一矿的采煤工人，是全国著名风镐手赵文信小组的副组长。十一月二十八日下午九点钟，在他工作的场所，木垛还未排完，顶板就要压下来。这时马兴只、冯顺林等六个人还在里面工作。杨山林大声喊叫：“同志们，顶板不好，快跑出来！”杨山林一边说，一边就忘记了自己的生命危险，勇敢地跳向里边去了。他帮助马兴只等六个人脱离了危险，同时用自己的身体抗住了要倒的木垛，和顶板搏斗起来。石头和栅子都在响动，几分钟后，他向外一跳，木垛就倒了下来。接着，鸭嘴棚子和其他木垛也歪了七架，顶板哄的一声也落了下来。可是，杨山林和其他六个工人都没有受到丝毫损伤。杨山林的这种英雄行为，不只使工人们非常感动，也受到了上级的表扬。

    桂林紫金电影院的“无人售票处”
    两个月收款和售票价款完全相符
    编辑同志：广西桂林紫金电影院为了便利观众买票看电影，自今年国庆节开始，在市区内四个地方创办了“无人售票处”。每处设一块圆形大木牌，上面简略地介绍着各期影片的内容。牌中心挂有收款箱，左右两旁粘贴每天晚上头场、二场的电影票，票上有座位号码和票价，买票人可以自由选择座位，把票款投到收款箱内。
    这些“无人售票处”办了将近两个月，并没有发现收款和所售出的票子价款有不符的现象，而且卖票很多。有一位住在解放桥头“无人售票处”附近的七十六岁的老人高达诗说：“我活了七十多岁，从没有看见过这样好的道德风气，这种新社会的新道德都是在毛主席、共产党和人民政府领导下才有的。”　更新
