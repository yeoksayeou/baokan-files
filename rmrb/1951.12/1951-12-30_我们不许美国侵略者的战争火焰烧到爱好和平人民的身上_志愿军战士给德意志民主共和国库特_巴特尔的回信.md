     We Will Not Allow the Flames of War of the American Aggressors to Burn the Peace-Loving People
     ——Reply from Volunteer Soldiers to Kurt Bartel of the German Democratic Republic
    Editor's Note: In the thirty-ninth issue of this journal on October 14th, we published a letter from Kurt Bartel, representative of the Free German Youth League of the German Democratic Republic, to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Recently, we received letters from Volunteer soldiers Xing Shujie, Li Deli, Zhu Zhizhou, Li Chunyang, Suo Liansheng, Shi Wancai, Cao Chunfu, Yang Jin, Zhu Baifu, Chang Zhanfeng, Shi Junji, Hong Kuanshun, Yu Hongbin, Cui Donghua, Cai Jinghai, Li Changlin, Luo Zhicheng, Liu Ziyi, Li Zhengzhong, Liu Xinzhi, etc., to Bartel. In addition to forwarding the original letter to Comrade Kurt Bartel in Berlin, we are now excerpting the letters from Comrades Xing Shujie and Li Deli for publication below:

Dear Bartel – Comrades and Comrades-in-Arms:
    We read your letter with great excitement on the Korean battlefield. We are ordinary soldiers, only having attended school for a few days, and cannot fully express the words in our hearts that we want to say, but we would like to say a few words to you; it feels wrong not to write.

    Dear Comrade-in-Arms: Like you, we have suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation from imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and many of our relatives have died under their knives. Among our comrades in the Volunteer Army, I don’t know how many individuals' parents, siblings, wives, and children have been killed by them. I don’t know how many people's houses and property have been looted by them. Now, under the banner of the great Mao Zedong, and under his wise leadership, we have stood up. We are in urgent need of peace, and we also know how to seek peace, and even more know how to deal with the inhuman, beast-like imperialism that wants to destroy humanity, wants to destroy everything of humanity. We know that American imperialism's invasion of Korea is the first knife it wants to use to slaughter the people of the world. It is continuing to burn the fire of war towards China. In order to extinguish this devastating fire of war, in order to defend the security of our motherland, in order to save the brotherly Korean people in disaster, in order not to allow this flame to burn any peace-loving people in the world, and for the peace and security of mankind and the world, we have bravely participated in the just war to resist America and aid Korea. These are the iron will and sacred and unavoidable responsibility of our Volunteer Army and the Chinese people.

    Dear Comrades-in-Arms: We also know that the German people and German youth are actively striving for the great and just struggle for the unification and peace of Germany. No matter how American imperialism provokes, how actively it arms West Germany in an attempt to realize its war plan, we believe that under the wise leadership of President Pieck and the active efforts of the national people, national men and women, and young people, you will surely win victory and completely destroy the conspiracy of American imperialism. Your struggle has also given each of our comrades infinite encouragement. May our friendship be deepened in this struggle in different places against a common enemy, and may we strike a heavier blow against the crazy aggressors – the American and British imperialist blocs.

    We shake your hand tightly and wish you success.

        Your close comrades-in-arms, soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Xing Shujie, Li Deli, November 3rd, in Korea

     我们不许美国侵略者的战争火焰烧到爱好和平人民的身上
     ——志愿军战士给德意志民主共和国库特·巴特尔的回信
    编者按：十月十四日本刊第三十九期发表了德意志民主共和国自由德国青年联盟代表库特·巴特尔写给中国人民志愿军的一封信。最近我们收到了志愿军邢树杰、李德溧、朱志洲、李春阳、所连生、史万才、曹春富、杨金、朱百福、常占枫、史俊吉、洪宽顺、于洪斌、崔东华、蔡景海、李长林、罗志诚、刘子义、李正中、刘心志等同志写给巴特尔的回信。除将原信转寄柏林库特·巴特尔同志外，现摘录邢树杰、李德溧两位同志的信发表于下：亲爱的巴特尔——战友与同志：
    我们在朝鲜战场上极其兴奋地读了你的信。我们是普通的士兵，只上过几天学，不能把我们要说的内心的话完全表达出来，但我们愿意和你说几句话，不写好像过不去似的。
    亲爱的战友：我们和你一样受过帝国主义和国内反动派的种种压榨和剥削，我们的许多亲人死在他们的屠刀下。在我们志愿军的同志中，不知有多少个人的父母兄弟姐妹妻子和小孩被他们杀死。不知有多少人的房屋财产曾遭受他们的抢掠。现在，我们在伟大的毛泽东的旗帜下，在他的英明领导下，已经站起来了。我们是迫切需要和平的，我们也知道怎样去求得和平，更知道怎样对付那惨无人道的想毁灭人类、想毁灭人类一切的野兽般的帝国主义。我们知道，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜是它想屠杀世界人民开的第一刀。它把战争的火继续向中国烧去。为了熄灭这毁灭性的战争的火，为了保卫我们祖国的安全，为了挽救灾难中的兄弟般的朝鲜人民，为了不许这火焰烧到世界任何爱好和平人民的身上，为了人类与世界的和平与安全，我们便奋不顾身地参加了抗美援朝的正义战争。这些就是我们志愿军和中国人民钢铁般的意志和神圣不可推诿的责任。
    亲密的战友：我们也知道了德国人民和德国青年正在积极努力为着德国的统一与和平进行着伟大的正义斗争。不管美帝国主义怎样挑拨，怎样积极武装西德企图实现它的战争计划，我们相信你们在皮克总统的英明领导及全国人民全国男女青年的积极努力下，一定会赢得胜利的，会把美帝国主义的阴谋完全摧毁的。你们的斗争，同样也给了我们每个同志以无限鼓舞。愿在这不同的地方与共同的敌人作斗争中，更加深我们之间的友谊，更沉重地打击疯狂的侵略者——美英帝国主义集团。
    紧握你的手，并祝你们胜利成功。
        你的亲密的战友，中国人民志愿军某部战士  邢树杰 李德溧十一月三日于朝鲜
