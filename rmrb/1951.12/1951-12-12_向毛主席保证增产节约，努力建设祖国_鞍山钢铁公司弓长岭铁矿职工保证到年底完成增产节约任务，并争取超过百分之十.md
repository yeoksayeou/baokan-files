The workers of the Gongchangling Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company pledge to complete the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy by the end of the year, and strive to exceed it by 10%
Dear Chairman Mao: Under your wise leadership, all of our workers and staff completed the state's annual production task for our mine 42 days ahead of schedule on November 19, exceeding it by 0.3%. In terms of quality, the average iron content of open-hearth ore was 13.3% higher than the standard, and the average iron content of blast furnace ore was 12.7% higher than the standard. Over the past year, our mine has enthusiastically launched a labor competition, which has produced 162 labor models in our mine, 35 city-wide labor models, and a large number of advanced producers. Over the past year, we have been actively producing with the attitude of masters. By the end of October, the average labor productivity had increased by 31.5% compared with last year, and the average labor productivity of mining and rock drilling workers had increased by 100.2% compared with last year. Over the past year, the workshop has initially implemented the economic accounting system and formulated workshop cost management methods, which have reduced the unit product cost this year by 20.9% compared with last year.
    Now, in order to actively respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, we pledge to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy by the end of the year, and strive to exceed it by 10%. All workers and staff of the Gongchangling Iron Mine, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

The Hui and Han farmers of Xinjicun Village, Linxia County, unite, stand up, and organize to produce
Respected Chairman Mao: Under the leadership of the People's Government, our Xinjicun Village has victoriously completed the land reform, and both Hui and Han farmers have stood up. Ten years ago, our village's poor and hired farmers had 750 mu of cultivated land, but by the time of liberation in 1949, only less than 300 mu remained, most of which had been expropriated by the landlord class. Now, all the expropriated land has been returned to its original owners, and the village's eleven single men have been allocated land and have begun to start families and build careers. Our Hui and Han farmers have changed from slaves to masters of the new society. Whether Hui or Han farmers, we all clearly realize that if it were not for your leadership of the Communist Party's arduous struggle to win the revolution, we would not be able to stand up.
    Chairman Mao! Please rest assured, now that we have land, we will definitely produce well. We resolutely respond to your call to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and strengthen the power of resistance against America and aid to Korea. After completing the land reform, we have plowed all the cultivated land in the village twice and accumulated a lot of fertilizer. We believe that the crops next year will definitely grow well.
    There are 75 Hui households and 15 Han households in our village. We know that it is because of the unity of Hui and Han farmers that we won such a great victory in the land reform. We promise to unite even more like a family in the future and do a good job in our production.
                    The entire Hui and Han farmers of Xinjicun Village, Xinjixiang Township, Linxia County, Gansu Province, respectfully

Lianyi District, Dongtai County, Northern Jiangsu, guarantees to complete the autumn grain collection task and actively participate in the Huai River harnessing project
Respected Chairman Mao: Under your wise leadership and the correct guidance of the higher authorities, our Lianyi District has victoriously completed various work tasks in the past three months. 1. We responded to the three major calls of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea; first of all, to date, nearly half of the 67,000 people in all 91 administrative villages in the district have revised their patriotic covenants. Secondly, the entire district has not only completed the 120 million yuan task of increasing production and donation, but also exceeded it by 15 million yuan. Thirdly, through a major inspection of the work of giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, the method of "contracting work and guaranteeing completion" for cultivation on their behalf has been established, so that the families of 941 martyrs, servicemen, and revolutionary workers have solved their problems of life and production. 2. In terms of cultivation: a total of 264,859 jin of improved varieties have been promoted in the district, and to date, 99% of the cultivated land has completed autumn plowing and autumn planting. 3. Regarding cotton sales: two batches of cotton sales tasks have been gloriously completed successively, totaling more than 320,000 jin of lint cotton.
    Now we are welcoming the two major new tasks of autumn grain collection and Huai River harnessing. We want to achieve: 1. Guarantee to complete the 5 million jin autumn grain collection task in three days, and guarantee the quality meets the standards; 2. Guarantee to send 3,750 laborers to participate in the Huai River harnessing project. Our district won two large award flags in the summer grain collection and military service work. Now we guarantee not to be proud, and we will work harder to strive for the model flag for autumn grain collection and Huai River harnessing in Dongtai County. In addition, we still have to guarantee to complete the various patriotic political tasks assigned to us by the Party and the government: 1. Guarantee that everyone in the district will establish and implement patriotic covenants, strive to donate more than 30 million yuan beyond the task, and establish a 100% "contracting work and guaranteeing completion" system in the work of cultivation on their behalf. 2. Strive to increase agricultural production in 1952 to exceed the pre-war level. 3. Strive to complete the third batch of 20,000 jin of lint cotton sales task before December this year, and guarantee to sell all the cotton to the state.

    向毛主席保证增产节约，努力建设祖国
    鞍山钢铁公司弓长岭铁矿职工保证到年底完成增产节约任务，并争取超过百分之十
    亲爱的毛主席：在您的英明领导下，我们全体职工在十一月十九日提前四十二天完成了国家给我矿的全年生产任务，并超过了百分之零点三。在质量方面，平炉矿平均含铁量比规定提高百分之十三点三，高炉矿平均含铁量比规定提高百分之十二点七。一年来，我矿热烈展开了劳动竞赛，在竞赛中涌现了一百六十二名本矿劳动模范，三十五名全市劳动模范，以及大批的先进生产者。一年来，我们用主人翁的姿态积极生产，到十月末，平均劳动生产率比去年提高百分之三十一点五，采矿凿岩工人的平均劳动生产率，比去年提高百分之一百点二。一年来，车间初步贯彻了经济核算制，制订了车间成本管理办法，使今年的单位产品成本，比去年降低百分之二十点九。
    现在，为了积极响应毛主席的增产节约的号召，我们保证：到年底完成增产节约任务，并争取超过百分之十。鞍山钢铁公司弓长岭铁矿全体职工临夏县新集村回汉农民团结翻身组织起来生产敬爱的毛主席：我们新集村在人民政府领导下已经胜利地完成了土地改革，回族农民和汉族农民都翻了身。十年前，我们全村贫雇农民还有耕地七百五十亩，到一九四九年解放时只剩下不够三百亩，大部分都被地主阶级剥夺去了。现在，所有被剥夺去的土地都全部回了老家，村里十一户光身汉都分到了土地，开始成家立业。我们回汉农民由奴隶变成了新社会的主人。无论回族农民或汉族农民都清楚地认识到：如果不是你领导共产党艰苦奋斗把革命闹胜利，我们便不能翻身。
    毛主席！请你放心，我们现在有了土地，一定会好好生产。我们坚决响应你的号召：增加生产，厉行节约，来支持中国人民志愿军，加强抗美援朝的力量。完成土地改革后，我们已把全村的耕地全部耕过两遍，并且积下了很多肥料。我们相信：明年的庄稼一定会长的很好。
    我们村里有回民七十五户，汉民十五户。我们知道：由于回汉农民团结，才在土地改革中打了这样一个大胜仗。我们保证：今后更要团结得像一家人一样，搞好我们的生产。
