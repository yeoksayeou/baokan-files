(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) News: After the Northeast People's Government Trade Department launched a movement against corruption, degeneration, and bureaucratism, the political consciousness and work enthusiasm of all staff members have generally improved.

At the beginning of the movement against corruption, degeneration, and bureaucratism, the administrative leaders of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department repeatedly conducted ideological mobilization among all staff members. First, the heads of departments, bureaus, divisions, and companies at all levels conducted strict self-criticism, and emphasized to all staff members that this movement would be resolutely carried out to the end. Next, all staff members launched study and discussion and carried out ideological preparation. At that time, staff members had various concerns, and leaders at all levels took "improving thinking and breaking concerns" as the central task. The administrative leadership announced cases of exposing corruption, degeneration, and bureaucratic behavior, and organized various discussion meetings. The ideological awareness of staff members gradually improved, and existing problems were gradually exposed. The department's leadership then guided the focus of the movement to confession and accusation, and called on everyone to "stand firm, safeguard the interests of the country and the people, and boldly confess and expose all bad phenomena of benefiting oneself at the expense of the public." Many directly affiliated units of the department organized confession report meetings, with confessors and accusers making reports. Some people who had been corrupt but had not confessed confessed their corrupt behavior on the spot after listening to the typical reports. After that, many staff members universally carried out self-examination in connection with their own situations. The department's administrative leadership promptly encouraged those who dared to expose shortcomings and make correct criticisms; those who resisted criticism or even took retaliatory measures were given severe criticism and punishment. The masses' emotions were therefore unprecedentedly high.

In order to promote the development of the movement, the department's CCP Party Committee and administrative leadership adopted various methods to carry out propaganda and mobilization. For example, through quick reports, blackboards, big-character posters, comic strips, plays, and other forms, they criticized corruption, degeneration, and bureaucratic behavior, and commended model figures. The leadership put forward opinions on the phenomena of corruption, degeneration, and bureaucratism exposed in the blackboards and quick reports one by one, guiding everyone to raise their understanding to a principled level.

In the course of the movement, the department's administrative leadership also carried out meticulous organizational work. First, it rationally arranged the progress and time of the movement, pre-set plans, grasped each level tightly, supervised each level, and insisted on carrying out the movement to the end. Secondly, the department had drawn seventeen cadres to go to its affiliated units to understand the situation, report collectively every night, and assist the leading cadres to promote the experience of advanced units in a timely manner, thereby promoting the entire movement. The department's administrative leadership also paid attention to giving play to the role of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists. For those corrupt and degenerated elements who had automatically confessed or were accused, they were quickly dealt with according to the specific circumstances, thus promoting the in-depth development of the movement. In order to prevent waste and other malpractices, the administrative leadership also organized a "household property investigation group," sending people to various directly affiliated units to check accounts and verify inventory materials, taking out the "small family property" of each unit and turning it over to the public.

Now, the level of awareness of all staff members has been greatly improved, the concept of cherishing state property has been universally established, and the atmosphere of thrift in the organs has gradually formed. According to the statistics of the department itself, the gasoline saved in October reached 2,408 catties, a decrease of one-fifth compared with August, and the expenditure on electricity bills was reduced by more than one-half compared with before the movement. The work responsibility and enthusiasm of cadres have been significantly improved. The workload of the Northeast Petroleum Company in the fourth quarter is much larger than in previous quarters, but due to the improvement of work efficiency, the work tasks in October have been completed as planned.

    深入展开反对贪污蜕化和官僚主义运动
    东北贸易部工作人员责任心显著加强
    普遍树立了爱护国家财产的观念节约风气已渐形成 【新华社讯】沈阳消息：东北人民政府贸易部展开反对贪污蜕化和官僚主义的运动后，全体工作人员的政治觉悟和工作积极性普遍提高。
    在反对贪污蜕化和官僚主义运动开始时，东北人民政府贸易部行政领导方面向全体工作人员反复地进行了思想动员。首先由部、局、处、公司的各级负责人进行严格的自我批评，并着重向全体工作人员说明这次运动要坚决贯彻到底。接着，全体工作人员便展开学习讨论，进行思想酝酿。当时工作人员有各式各样的顾虑，各级领导干部就把“提高思想，打破顾虑”当作中心工作来进行。行政领导方面公布了揭发贪污、蜕化和官僚主义行为的案件，并且组织了各种讨论会，工作人员的思想觉悟逐渐提高，存在的问题逐渐暴露。该部领导方面随即把运动的重心导向坦白和检举，并号召大家“站稳立场，维护国家和人民的利益，大胆坦白和揭露一切损公利己的恶劣现象”。该部许多直属单位组织了坦白典型报告会，由坦白人和检举人作报告。有些曾经贪污而尚未坦白的人，在听了典型报告后，当场坦白了自己的贪污行为。此后，许多工作人员普遍联系自己进行检查。该部行政领导方面对于勇于揭发缺点进行正确批评的人，随时加以鼓励；对抗拒批评甚至采取报复手段的人，给予严厉批评、处分。群众情绪因而空前高涨。
    为了推动运动的开展，该部中共党委和行政领导方面采取了各种办法来进行宣传鼓动。例如，通过快报、黑板报、大字报、连环画、演戏等形式，批评贪污蜕化和官僚主义的行为，表扬模范人物。领导方面对于黑板报和快报上揭发的贪污蜕化和官僚主义现象，一一提出了意见，引导大家提高到原则高度来认识。
    在运动过程中，该部行政领导方面还进行了细致的组织工作。首先合理安排运动进程、时间，预先订好计划，层层抓紧，层层督促，坚持把运动贯彻到底。其次，该部曾抽调了十七个干部，分别到所属各单位去了解情况，每晚集中汇报，协助领导干部及时推广先进单位的经验，因而推动了整个运动。该部行政领导方面并注意发挥共产党员、青年团员和积极分子的作用。对于已经自动坦白或检举出来的贪污蜕化分子，依据具体情况，迅速作了处理，因而促进了运动的深入开展。行政领导方面为了防止浪费现象和其他弊端，并组织了“清查家底小组”，派人到各直属单位清查账目，核对库存物资，把各单位“小家底”拿出交公。
    现在，全体工作人员觉悟程度已大大提高，普遍树立了爱护国家财产的观念，机关里的节约风气已逐渐形成。仅该部本部统计，十月份节省汽油就达二千四百零八斤，比八月份减少了五分之一，电灯费开支比运动开展前减少了二分之一以上。干部的工作责任心和积极性已显著提高。东北区石油公司第四季度的工作任务比以前各季大得多，但是，由于工作效率提高，十月份工作任务已按计划完成。
