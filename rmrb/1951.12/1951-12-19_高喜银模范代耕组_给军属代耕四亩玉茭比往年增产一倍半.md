The Gao Xiyin Model Farming Team (comprising four people) in the Third District of Qixian County, Shanxi Province, has been selected as a model farming team to attend the county-wide labor model conference. This honor is not accidental. This year, they cultivated 5.7 mu of land for the family of revolutionary soldier Zhang Juyi, with four mu planted with corn and 1.7 mu with wheat. During the spring planting season, there was a drought, so they quickly carried water to plant the seeds. A few days later, it rained, and the seedlings emerged. They then quickly thinned the seedlings, weeding three times during the hot season. Unexpectedly, a severe drought followed, threatening to kill the seedlings. Gao Xiyin convened the team to find ways to irrigate the land. Since the land was dry and the water source was low, they quickly built a dike to connect to the canal. They brought water to the land, irrigating it twice in a row, saving the seedlings. In the autumn, the four mu of corn yielded ten shi, one and a half times higher than the usual four shi yield. Currently, they have applied forty loads of fertilizer to the 1.7 mu of wheat land cultivated for the military family. Furthermore, the four mu of corn land have also been sown with wheat. Gao Xiyin stated that they would improve their cultivation work next year and harvest even more grain.

    高喜银模范代耕组
    给军属代耕四亩玉茭比往年增产一倍半
    山西祁县三区高喜银代耕组（共四人）已被选为出席全县劳动模范大会的模范代耕组。这份光荣不是偶然的。今年他们给革命军人家属张居义代耕五亩七分地，四亩种的是玉茭、一亩七分是麦子。春天下种时天旱，他们赶紧担水点种。几天后下了雨，青苗长出来了，他们又赶紧锄苗，赶入伏天共锄了三次。不料入伏后天旱得厉害，眼看青苗要旱死，高喜银就召集全组开会，想办法浇地。这地是旱地，地高水低他们就赶紧修一道埝接住水渠。引水上地，一连浇了两次，救活了苗。秋天四亩玉茭打了十石，比往年只打四石的产量要高出一倍半。目前他们给军属代耕的一亩七分麦地，已上了四十担粪。另外四亩玉茭地，也已经给种成麦地了。高喜银说明年一定要把代耕工作搞得更好，打更多粮食。　高廷仁　农质　原斌
