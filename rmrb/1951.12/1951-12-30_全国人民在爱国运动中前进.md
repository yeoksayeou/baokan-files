    National People Advancing in the Patriotic Movement

    I. We Smashed the American Imperialist
        Aggression Plan

    Premier Zhou Enlai said at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The patriotic movement of the entire Chinese people is surging to an unprecedented height, which is unattainable in decades or even centuries in normal times." In the year 1951, the Chinese people accomplished many earth-shattering events. At the beginning of 1951, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sent good news to the people of the whole country. In the nine-day New Year offensive (Third Campaign), the Chinese and Korean People's Armies annihilated more than 13,000 enemies. This was followed by the victories of the Fourth and Fifth Campaigns, defeating the invading army under the command of the American warlord MacArthur, who had been rampant in Japan and the Far East since the end of World War II. This forced American imperialism to accept the suggestion of Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, and begin Korean armistice negotiations with us on July 10. After that, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies continued to strike the enemy near the "38th Parallel," successively crushing the enemy's so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," and the enemy's losses increased day by day. From the time the Volunteer Army went abroad to fight on October 25, 1950, to the end of November this year, a total of more than 490,000 enemies were annihilated
    (of which more than 210,000 were American soldiers). This victory smashed the American imperialist aggression plan to occupy Korea and attack the Chinese mainland, and inspired the confidence of the people of China, Asia and the world in the struggle for peace and against imperialism.

    II. Endless Patriotic Deeds, Educating Us to Love Our Great
        Motherland Even More

    While the Volunteer Army was winning consecutive battles on the Korean front, the patriotic movement of the people across the country was also vigorously developing. In the first half of the year, in the movement against the United States arming Japan and supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, and in the popularization of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, 80 percent of the people across the country received patriotic education. More than 344.4 million people participated in signing in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, and 339.9 million people participated in voting against the United States arming Japan. Since June, the people of the whole country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and launched the three major movements of promoting patriotic conventions, donating aircraft and artillery, and doing a good job in preferential treatment. More than half of the people across the country have signed patriotic conventions. As of December 26, the people across the country had donated more than 4,728 billion yuan, equivalent to the value of 3,152 fighter jets.

    In the patriotic movement across the country, many touching deeds have emerged. In many places, when they heard that manpower was to be mobilized to support the front and strengthen national defense, everyone rushed to sign up. In Daming County, Hebei Province, more than 2,500 young people applied to join the army in seven days during the commemoration of National Day in 1951. When the State Council twice decided to enroll students in various military cadre schools, 580,000 young people across the country enthusiastically signed up. Zhang Zhiyun, a military family member in Changsha City, Hunan, gave all nine of her children to the country. She said: "To make the motherland rich, strong and safe, we must dedicate all our children to the motherland."

    In our factories and mines, workers shouted that they would increase production to strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea. More than two million workers across the country participated in the patriotic labor competition. Workers in state-owned and local industries in Northeast China have increased production and saved more than 10 million tons of grain wealth for the country in the past year. Workers at the Tangshan Steel Plant in Hebei braved temperatures of over 800 degrees to repair their
    "Resist America, Aid Korea" electric furnace in order to shorten the furnace repair time and increase production.

    In our rural areas, many places have launched patriotic bumper harvest movements. In Hebei Province alone, 300,000 mutual aid groups have signed patriotic bumper harvest plans, and 10,000 labor models in 5,000 villages have launched production competitions. Recently, they launched a "Thousand Villages, Ten Thousand Groups Model Bumper Harvest Movement" in 1952. During the cotton planting season in 1951, there was a drought, and under the encouragement of "planting patriotic cotton," farmers carried water to plant day and night. Thirty million mu of cotton fields across the country were planted with water. After the harvest, farmers in many places enthusiastically paid patriotic public grain. In Daming County, Hebei, on July 2, 1951, 3.8 million catties of public grain were paid in one day, exceeding the task by 300,000 catties.

    The patriotic movement has spread to all strata and corners of the people across the country. In Beijing, some old artists in their seventies and eighties also participated in patriotic benefit performances to donate aircraft and artillery. Children in Shanghai organized to collect scrap iron and donate it to make bullets for their Volunteer Army uncles. People of all ethnic groups living on the Yunnan border have signed "Patriotic Home Protection Joint Defense Conventions" to assist the People's Liberation Army in guarding the border of the motherland. Yang Yingming, a 62-year-old farmer of the Lisu ethnic group in Tengchong County (bordering Burma), carries a gun to patrol the mountain area on the border every night. The mountain search team he organized has captured nine bandits. Lamas in many temples in Xikang have also signed patriotic conventions, organized to study current affairs, and organized to reclaim wasteland and dig medicinal materials to increase production and donations. Catholic priests in Chongqing refused to accept more than 10 million US dollars sent by imperialists from Hong Kong, and some church members organized to participate in production. They said:
    "We would rather twist hemp ropes and make straw sandals than take the stinky money from the United States."

    III. Look at the Achievements of Construction, Defend the Good Days of Happiness

    The enthusiastic participation of the people across the country in the patriotic movement proves the superiority of our new democratic social system. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, a bright and happy future is unfolding before the new China. The People's Government has led us in implementing land reform and democratic reforms in industrial, mining, transportation and other enterprises, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. All aspects of our country's construction have made great progress.

    For example, in economic construction, the industrial production and grain output in 1951 exceeded those in 1950. In the first half of this year, the total output of 21 major industrial products increased by 44 percent compared with last year. Our cotton production has exceeded the highest year before the war. We have begun to build the largest Huai River harnessing project in Chinese water conservancy history. The western part of the Northeast Administrative Region has begun a plan to transform nature - building protective forest belts including 8.66 million hectares (approximately equal to half of the cultivated land area in the Northeast Region). The wisdom of the working people of our country has been brought into new play, and labor creation has been respected by the people across the country. Our workers have manufactured cars and tractors themselves, and thousands of inventions and new records have emerged. Hao Jianxiu, a 17-year-old female worker in Qingdao, has become a nationally renowned labor model. The fine yarn work method she created is being learned by hundreds of thousands of textile workers. Many models have also emerged in agricultural production across the country. For example, Qu Yaoli in Shanxi Province harvested 920 catties of cotton per mu. Shi Anfu in Hancheng County, Shaanxi, harvested 810 catties of wheat per mu. Li Chenggui in Liling County, Hunan, harvested 1,472 catties of rice per mu. The creations of these people have attracted the attention of the people across the country. The Central People's Government and local governments have sent experts to investigate and study and summarize their experiences for farmers across the country to learn from. Chinese farmers have been farming for thousands of years and have never received such care and attention from the government as they do today.

    Because production has increased and the People's Government has vigorously stabilized prices, people's lives have gradually improved. According to a survey in the Northeast Region, the purchasing power of the people in urban and rural areas of the entire region in 1951 increased by 1.5 times compared with 1949. In 1949, the people of the entire region bought one piece of cloth for every ten people on average, and in 1951, they bought one piece of cloth for every three people; the amount of rice eaten by the people of the entire region in 1951 increased sixfold compared with 1949; flour increased more than fivefold; pork increased more than 1.5 times.

    Following the rise in economic life is the rise in the cultural life of the people across the country. The number of children enrolled in schools has reached 37 million, more than double the number during the Kuomintang government. Herdsmen's children on the Inner Mongolia grasslands also have their own primary schools. The Yi people in Xikang Province have also created their own new writing system. 1.78 million workers across the country have entered spare-time schools. 11 million farmers have entered year-round literacy schools. The number of people attending winter schools this winter will reach 35 million. People's cultural activities have also been widely carried out. 3,400 workers' clubs have been established in our factories and enterprises. We have 1,000 film projection teams and 10,000 magic lanterns touring and showing films in various places.

    In order to defend the current good times and for our bright future, the people across the country should more enthusiastically participate in the patriotic production increase and thrift movement. The people of the whole country victoriously spent 1951 in the great patriotic movement. Let us be full of confidence and further deepen and develop our patriotic movement in 1952 and strive for greater victory.

### 全国人民在爱国运动中前进

专栏：宣传员讲话

    全国人民在爱国运动中前进
    一、我们打垮了美帝国主义的侵
        略计划
    周恩来总理在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上说：“全中国人民的爱国运动空前高涨，这是平常时期几十年甚至几百年所不能达到的。”一九五一年这一年，中国人民做出了许多惊天动地的大事。还在一九五一年年初的时候，中国人民志愿军就给全国人民送来了捷报。中朝人民军队在九天的新年攻势里（第三次战役），就消灭了敌人一万三千多。接着又有第四次战役和第五次战役的胜利，把自从第二次世界大战结束以后，就在日本和远东横行霸道的美国军阀麦克阿瑟指挥下的侵略军打败了。这就迫使美帝国主义不得不接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克的建议，从七月十日开始和我们举行朝鲜停战谈判。这以后，中朝人民军队又继续在“三八”线附近打击敌人，连着打垮了敌人的什么“夏季攻势”、“秋季攻势”，敌人的损失一天比一天多。从一九五○年十月二十五日志愿军出国作战开始到今年十一月底，敌人总共被歼灭了四十九万多
    （其中美国兵占二十一万以上）。这个胜利，把美帝国主义侵占朝鲜、进攻中国大陆的侵略计划打得稀烂，鼓舞了全中国、全亚洲和全世界人民争取和平反对帝国主义的斗争信心。
    二、说不完的爱国事迹，教育我们更加热爱伟大
        的祖国
    当志愿军在朝鲜前线连连不断打胜仗的时候，全国人民的爱国运动也蓬勃地开展起来。在上半年的反对美国武装日本、拥护五大国缔结和平公约运动和普及抗美援朝运动中，全国人民有百分之八十受到了爱国主义的教育。有三亿四千四百余万人参加了拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名，三亿三千九百九十万人参加了反对美国武装日本的投票。六月份以来，全国人民热烈响应抗美援朝总会的号召，开展了推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和做好优抚工作的三大运动。全国人民已有一半以上订立了爱国公约。截至十二月二十六日止，全国人民捐献了四万七千二百八十亿余元，等于三千一百五十二架战斗机的价值。
    在全国各地的爱国运动中，出现了许多感动人的事迹。许多地方听说要动员人力去支援前线、加强国防的时候，大家就抢先去报名。河北省大名县在纪念一九五一年国庆节时，七天中就有两千五百多名青年要求参军。政务院两次决定各军事干部学校招生的时候，全国有五十八万青年踊跃报名。湖南长沙市的军属张志云，把九个儿女都交给国家。她说：“要祖国得到富强安全，只有把孩子都贡献给祖国。”
    在我们的工厂矿山里，职工们高喊着要增加生产来加强抗美援朝的力量。全国有两百多万工人参加了爱国主义的劳动竞赛。东北国营工业和地方工业的职工，一年来给国家增产节约了一千多万吨粮食的财富。河北唐山炼钢厂的工人为了缩短修炉时间，增加生产，冒着八百多度高温去修补他们的
    “抗美援朝号”电炉。
    在我们的农村里，许多地方开展了爱国丰产运动。光是河北省就有三十万个互助组订立了爱国丰产计划，有五千个村的一万个劳动模范展开了生产竞赛。最近他们又发起了在一九五二年开展一个“千村万组模范丰产运动”。一九五一年种棉的时节碰上了天旱，农民们在“种爱国棉花”的鼓舞下，不分昼夜挑水点种。全国有三千万亩棉田是挑水点种的。许多地方的农民在丰收以后踊跃交纳爱国公粮，河北大名县在一九五一年七月二日一天里，就缴齐了公粮三百八十万斤，并且超过任务三十万斤。
    爱国运动普及到了全国人民的各个阶层和各个角落。北京有的年纪有了七八十岁的老艺人，也参加了捐献飞机大炮的爱国义演。上海市的少年儿童们，组织起来收集废铁捐献出来制造子弹供给志愿军叔叔。住在云南边境的各民族人民，许多人订立了“爱国保家联防公约”，协助解放军守卫祖国的边境。腾冲县（和缅甸接界的地方）傈僳族六十二岁的农民杨应明，每晚背着枪到边界山地里去巡查。他所组织的搜山小组，已经捉住了九个土匪。西康许多寺院里的喇嘛，也都订立了爱国公约，组织起来学习时事，组织起来开荒地、挖药材，增产捐献。重庆的天主教神甫拒绝接受帝国主义从香港寄来的美金
    一千多万元，有的教友组织起来参加生产。他们说：
    “我们宁愿搓麻绳，打草鞋，也不要美国的臭钱。”
    三、看看建设的成绩，保卫幸福的好日子
    全国人民这样热烈地参加爱国运动，证明了我们新民主主义社会制度的优越性。在中国共产党的领导和伟大的社会主义国家苏联的帮助下，新中国的面前展开了无限光明幸福的远景。人民政府领导我们实行了土地改革和工矿交通企业中的民主改革，镇压了反革命分子，我们国家的各项建设都有很大的进步。
    比如，在经济建设上，一九五一年的工业生产量和粮食产量都超过了一九五○年。今年上半年二十一种主要工业品的总产量比去年增加了百分之四十四。我们的棉花产量则已超过了战前的最高年份。我们开始修建了中国水利史上最大的修治淮河的工程。东北大行政区的西部开始了一个改造自然的计划——建造包括八百六十六万垧（约等于东北区已耕地面积的一半）的防护林带。我国劳动人民的智慧有了新的发挥，劳动创造受到全国人民的尊敬。我们的工人自己制造了汽车，自己制造了拖拉机，出现了千千万万件发明创造和新纪录。青岛市一个十七岁的女工郝建秀，已经成了全国闻名的劳动模范。他所创造的细纱工作法，有几十万纺织工人在学习。全国农业生产中也涌现了许多模范。比如，山西省的曲耀离，在一亩地里收了九百二十斤棉花。陕西韩城县的史安福，一亩地打了八百一十斤小麦。湖南醴陵县的李承桂，一亩田收水稻一千四百七十二斤。这些人的创造，引起了全国人民的重视，中央人民政府和各地的地方政府，派专家去调查研究，总结他们的经验，供全国农民学习。中国农民种了几千年田，从来没有像今天这样受到政府的关心和重视。
    因为生产上升，人民政府又大力平稳了物价，人民生活已经逐渐得到改善。据东北区的调查，全区城乡人民一九五一年的购买力比一九四九年提高了一倍半。全区人民一九四九年平均每十个人买一匹布，一九五一年每三个人就买一匹；全区人民在一九五一年吃的大米，比一九四九年增加到六倍；面粉提高到五倍多；猪肉提高一倍半以上。
    跟着经济生活上升的是全国人民文化生活的上升。我们的入学儿童已经达到三千七百万，超过了国民党政府时期的一倍。内蒙古草原上的牧民子弟，也有了自己的小学。西康省的彝族人民也创造了自己的新文字。全国职工有一百七十八万进了业余学校。一千一百万农民进了常年民校。这个冬天上冬学的人数将达三千五百万。人民的文艺活动也广泛开展起来了。我们的工厂企业里建立了三千四百个工人俱乐部。我们已有一千个电影放映队和一万架幻灯机在各地巡回放映。
    为了保卫现在的好光景，为了我们未来美好的日子，全国人民应该更加热烈地参加爱国增产节约运动。全国人民在伟大的爱国运动中，胜利地度过了一九五一年，让我们满怀着信心，在一九五二年更加深入和发展我们的爱国运动，争取更大的胜利。
