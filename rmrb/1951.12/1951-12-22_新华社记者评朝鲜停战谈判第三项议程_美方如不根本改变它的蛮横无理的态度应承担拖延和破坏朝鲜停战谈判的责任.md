Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 21st: This reporter reports: It has been twenty-four days since the Korean armistice negotiations entered the discussion of the third item on the agenda – "Specific arrangements for achieving a ceasefire and armistice in Korea" – on November 27. During this period, the Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly proposed reasonable solutions acceptable to both sides in order to facilitate a swift agreement. However, due to the U.S. side's continued use of delaying tactics and insistence on brutal and unreasonable demands, the negotiations have so far yielded no results.

As everyone knows, at the first meeting after the negotiations turned to the third agenda item, the Korean-Chinese side put forward five fair and reasonable principles and suggestions. However, because the U.S. side insisted on its unreasonable demands to interfere in Korea's internal affairs and threaten the security of the Korean-Chinese People's forces and their rear areas, the negotiations made no progress in the first week. On December 3, in order to break the deadlock created by the U.S. side, our representative put forward two additional suggestions, stipulating that during the armistice period, neither side should transport troops, weapons, or ammunition into Korea in any form, and that inspection groups composed of representatives from neutral countries should be established to conduct supervision at rear ports agreed upon by both sides. These supplementary suggestions were so reasonable and fair that even the Associated Press had to admit: "There is little doubt that the Communists genuinely want an armistice in Korea."

The U.S. side's response to our sincere efforts was, first, to deliberately raise frivolous questions and waste time, and then to put forward another ambiguous clause: demanding "not to increase the level of troops, personnel, war equipment, military facilities or materials in Korea at the time the armistice agreement takes effect." According to the U.S. side's later explanations and supplements, the specific meaning of this "not to increase" the original "level" is that the Korean people must not build airports and so-called "related facilities" within their own country, while the U.S. side can completely strengthen its forces in Korea in the form of so-called "rotation or replenishment."

The U.S. side delayed its response to the suggestion of forming an independent inspection team composed of representatives from neutral countries to conduct supervision at the rear locations agreed upon by both sides for as long as nine days. Because of the transparency and reasonableness of our proposal, even the British "Manchester Guardian" admitted that it was "quite reasonable." On December 12, the U.S. side was forced to express "agreement" to organize a neutral country inspection team, but still demanded to inspect the entire territory and conduct undisturbed aerial reconnaissance and photography.

Because the U.S. side continued to insist on this unreasonable demand, the negotiations made no progress in the ten days in between. On December 14, our side made another major effort and put forward a revised six-point proposal, agreeing to a rotation of no more than 5,000 people per month as needed, provided that both sides guarantee that no military forces, military personnel, war equipment, or ammunition will enter Korea from outside Korea during the armistice. On the issue of neutral inspection agencies, it was suggested that the inspection team be given full convenience for inspection and supervision activities at rear ports agreed upon by both sides. However, the stubborn and unchanging U.S. representative continued to insist on its unreasonable demands to restrict construction on the Korean side while being able to conduct unrestricted "rotation and replenishment" and "free inspection" throughout Korea. Therefore, as of yesterday, negotiations on agenda item three were still deadlocked.

Analyzing the unreasonable demands that the U.S. side has insisted on since the discussion of the third agenda item began, people have ample reason to suspect: Is what the U.S. side is pursuing in the negotiations a fair and reasonable armistice agreement, or clauses that guarantee the United States' unilateral military interests, in order to facilitate a new war in the future?

The U.S. side insists on restricting military facilities within Korea, especially airports and so-called "related facilities" (according to the U.S. side's explanation, including gasoline warehouses, railway branch lines, etc.), on the grounds of avoiding so-called "possible threats." This is nonsense and completely unreasonable. Anyone with ordinary political common sense understands that engaging in such construction within one's own borders is the sacred and indisputable right of any independent country. Any attempt to deny this right is a brutal interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The U.S. side's insistence on such interference is nothing more than to put the Korean side in a position without defensive capabilities, so that it can engage in blackmail or even military adventures at favorable times. The U.S. side's absurd demand is clearly completely contrary to the interests of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and is also intolerable to any sovereign and independent country. If we follow the U.S. side's logic, our side has even more reason to demand that the United States stop all military facilities, including airports, within its own country, because all of these military facilities in the United States are for the purpose of external aggression, and are clearly "possible threats" to the people of China and Korea and the people of all countries in the world. The U.S. side also shamelessly quibbles that because the Korean people's work of building airports in their own country is now being obstructed by the U.S. side, while the U.S. side has not yet been prevented from building airports in Korea. But everyone knows that even Vandenberg admitted that the U.S. side has been using its air force to its full extent in Korea, and has not yet stopped the Korean people from building their new airports. Isn't the U.S. side's demand an attempt to achieve in negotiations goals that it cannot achieve through military action?

The U.S. side's insistence on conducting free inspections throughout Korea and unobstructed aerial photography and inspections, just like its insistence on prohibiting the construction of military facilities within Korea, is also an intolerable interference in Korea's internal affairs. The U.S. side's trick of trying to obtain the "freedom" of inspection that it cannot obtain in the war at the negotiating table will never succeed.

As for the U.S. side's insistence on unlimited "rotation and replenishment" during the armistice period, its brutality and unreasonableness are even more obvious. The U.S. representative, on the one hand, advocated "no increase in military forces, equipment or materials," and on the other hand, insisted that the U.S. side must carry out so-called "rotation and replenishment" of fresh troops and new equipment from outside Korea without restriction, and completely refused to adopt a consultative attitude. Since the U.S. side agrees to stop the war and seek peace, why should it stubbornly insist on unlimitedly increasing military forces and importing war equipment and materials? What other explanation can there be except to show that the U.S. side does have sinister intentions hidden in its heart?

For more than three weeks, the Korean-Chinese side has made various sincere efforts to make the armistice a reality. Even "qualified British人士" in London admitted that, due to the efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, including "sufficient concessions" on the issue of troop rotation, "all the necessary conditions for a ceasefire have been achieved in principle." However, the U.S. side not only did not abandon its unreasonable demands to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people, restrict construction within Korea, and conduct "free inspection" on the ground and in the air throughout the territory, but also repeated its already bankrupt "military pressure" fallacy. The U.S. side's foolish and absurd attitude has put the sincere efforts of our representatives to reach an armistice agreement within thirty days, and the ardent hope of the peace-loving people of the world to reach an agreement within thirty days, in danger of being dashed. Now there are only six days left before the deadline, and if the U.S. side does not fundamentally change its brutal and unreasonable attitude, then it must bear the responsibility for delaying and undermining the armistice negotiations.

    新华社记者评朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程
    美方如不根本改变它的蛮横无理的态度应承担拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的责任
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社记者报道：自从朝鲜停战谈判于十一月二十七日进入第三项议程——“在朝鲜境内实现停火与休战的具体安排”的讨论以来，已历时二十四天。在这期间，朝中方面为便于双方迅速获得协议，曾数次提出可为双方接受的合理的办法，但由于美方继续采取拖延战术，并坚持蛮横无理的要求，使谈判迄今仍无结果。
    大家知道，在谈判转入第三项议程的第一次会议上，朝中方面就提出了五点公平合理的原则建议。但由于美方坚持其干涉朝鲜内政、威胁朝中人民部队及其后方安全的无理要求，谈判在第一周中毫无进展。十二月三日，我方代表为了打开美方造成的僵局，又提出了两点补充建议，规定在停战期间，双方不得以任何形式向朝鲜运入军队和武器弹药以及成立由中立国家代表组成的视察组到双方同意的后方口岸进行监督。这些补充建议是如此合情合理，以致连美联社也不得不承认：“共方真正希望在朝鲜停战，是没有多少可怀疑的地方了。”
    美方对于我方这一真诚的努力，始则故意滥发疑问，浪费时间，继则提出了另一个暧昧的条文：要求“不提高停战协议生效时在朝鲜的部队、人员、战争装备、军事设备或物资的水平”。按照美方后来的解释和补充，这个“不提高”原有“水平”的具体含义就是朝鲜人民不得在其本国境内修建机场和所谓“有关设备”，而美方则完全可以以所谓“轮换或补充”的形式增强其在朝部队的实力。
    关于由中立国家代表组成独立的视察小组到双方同意的后方地点进行监督的建议，美方迁延不作答复竟达九天之久。由于我方建议的光明磊落，以致连英国“曼彻斯特卫报”都承认其为“颇够合理”。十二月十二日，美方不得已表示“同意”组织中立国视察小组，但仍然要求得在全境视察，并进行不受干扰的空中侦察和摄影。
    由于美方继续坚持这种无理的要求，谈判在十天中间仍无任何进展。十二月十四日，我方再一次作了重大努力，提出修正后的六条方案，同意在双方保证在停战期间不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事部队、军事人员、战争装备和弹药的原则下，得视需要进行每月不超过五千人的轮换。在中立视察机构的问题上，建议规定予视察小组到双方同意的后方口岸进行视察、监督的活动以充分的便利。但顽梗不变的美方代表，继续坚持其限制朝鲜方面的建设而自己则得进行无限制“轮换和补充”和在朝鲜全境“自由视察”的无理要求。因此，到昨天为止，关于议程第三项的谈判，仍然陷于僵局当中。
    分析一下美方自第三项议程的讨论开始以来所坚持的无理要求，人们有充分的理由怀疑：美方在谈判中所追求的究竟是公平合理的停战协议呢，还是保障美国以片面的军事利益的条款，以利于将来重新发动战争？
    美方坚持限制朝鲜境内的军事设施，特别是飞机场及所谓“有关设备”（按美方解释，包括汽油仓库、铁路支线等），理由是所谓避免“可能的威胁”。这是胡说八道和完全没有道理的。任何一个具有普通政治常识的人都明白，在国境之内从事这种建设，乃是任何一个独立国家不容争辩的神圣权利。任何否认这种权利的企图，都是对他国内政的横暴干涉。美方坚持这种干涉的目的，无非是要朝鲜方面处于没有防御能力的地位，以便在有利的时机，进行敲诈勒索以至军事上的冒险。美方这种岂有此理的要求，显然是与和平解决朝鲜问题的利益完全背驰的，也是任何一个尊重主权的独立国家所不能容忍的。如果按照美方的逻辑，我方更有理由要求美国在国内停止包括飞机场在内的一切军事设施，因为美国的这一切军事设施都是为了向外侵略的目的，对中朝两国和世界各国人民显然都是“可能的威胁”。美方又无耻地诡辩说，因为朝鲜人民在本国境内修建机场的工作现在是受到美方的阻挠的，而美方在朝鲜境内建造飞机场却还未受到阻止。但是大家都知道，连范顿伯也承认，美方在朝鲜倾其空军全力，迄今并未阻止住朝鲜人民修建他们新的机场的活动。美方这种要求，难道不是企图在谈判中获得他们以军事行动所不能达到的目标吗？
    美方坚持在朝鲜全境进行自由视察和无阻拦的空中摄影和视察，如同它坚持禁止朝鲜境内修建军事设施一样，同样是对朝鲜内政不能容忍的干涉。美方企图在谈判桌上获得它在战争中所不能得到的视察“自由”的伎俩，是决不能得逞的。
    至于美方坚持在停战期间无限制“轮换和补充”，其横蛮无理是更加显然的。美方代表一方面主张“不得增加军事力量、装备或物资”，另一方面又坚持美方得无限制进行自朝鲜境外输入生力部队及新的装备的所谓“轮换和补充”，并根本拒绝采取协商态度。美方既然是同意停止战争、谋求和平，为什么又要顽固地坚持无限制增加军事力量和输入战争装备及物资呢？这除了说明美方确实具有包藏祸心的阴险目的之外，还能有任何别的解释么？
    三周余来，朝中方面为了使停战得以实现，曾作了种种真诚的努力。连伦敦“有资格的英国人士”都承认，由于朝中方面这种努力，包括在军队轮换问题上的“充分的让步”，“一切停火必需的条件在原则上都已实现了。”可是，美方非但始终不放弃其干涉朝鲜人民内政、限制朝鲜境内建设和在全境进行地面和空中的“自由视察”的无理要求，反而又重弹其早经破产了的“军事压力”的谰调。美方这种愚妄和荒谬的态度，已使我方代表为在三十天内获致停战协议所进行的诚意努力，使世界爱好和平人民所抱在三十天内获致协议的热望有破灭的危险。现在离限期终止已只有六天的时间了，美方如不根本改变它的蛮横无理的态度，那么，拖延和破坏停战谈判的责任，必须由它来承担。
