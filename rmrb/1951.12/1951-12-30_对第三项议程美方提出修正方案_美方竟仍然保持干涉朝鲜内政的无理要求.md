Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 29th. At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks on the 29th, the opposing side put forward an amended proposal. In this amended proposal, although the opposing side abandoned the demand for aerial reconnaissance over the entire territory of Korea and agreed that the limits of armed personnel rotation during the armistice period should be determined through mutual agreement, it still insisted on restricting the construction of airfields within Korea, an act of interference in our internal affairs. Our representative pointed out that although the other side's amended proposal was slightly more progressive than the previous proposals, on the most important issue of facilities within Korea, the other side's proposal still maintained the demand to interfere in our internal affairs, which is precisely what we absolutely cannot allow. At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, there was no progress because the other side continued to refuse to determine the principle of prompt release and repatriation of all prisoners of war by both sides.

    对第三项议程美方提出修正方案
    美方竟仍然保持干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求
    【新华社开城二十九日电】在二十九日的朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方提出了修正方案。在这一修正方案中，对方虽然放弃了在朝鲜全境进行空中侦察的要求，同意停战期间武装人员轮换的限度须经双方协议决定，但仍坚持限制朝鲜境内飞机场修建的干涉我方内政的要求。我方代表指出：对方的修正方案虽然比较以往对方的方案略有进步，但在朝鲜境内设备的最主要的问题上，对方方案仍然保持干涉我方内政的要求，而这正是我方所绝对不能允许的。在第四项议程的小组委员会上，由于对方继续拒绝确定双方迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则，因而毫无进展。
