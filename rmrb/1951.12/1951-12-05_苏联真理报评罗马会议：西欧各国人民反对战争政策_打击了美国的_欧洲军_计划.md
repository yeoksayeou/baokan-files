Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd: *Pravda* commentator, Kolionov, recently wrote an article commenting on the results of the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Rome, stating: The issue of assembling German fascist troops as quickly as possible was one of the central issues discussed at the Rome war-mongers' meeting. The American delegation clearly demanded that the participants in the Rome meeting submit a concrete plan within two months to organize a European army including "strong German troops." At the same time, the American representatives also requested that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council pass a resolution ordering Western European countries to provide forty divisions of well-prepared troops to be handed over to Eisenhower by the summer of next year. Eisenhower, in his speech at the meeting, demanded that the North Atlantic Group countries expand their rearmament plans by 25 percent.

The author continued: The demands of the American masters threw the countries participating in the meeting into disarray. Although they were completely obedient to Washington, the rulers of Western European countries had to see that the already crumbling economic foundations of their countries, weakened by war and the "Marshall Plan," were beginning to collapse under the heavy burden of rearmament. Countries drawn into the North Atlantic Group are increasingly facing the looming shadow of economic disaster. But the problem is not just economic difficulties. The anger of people everywhere is growing towards the criminal policies pursued by the heads of the North Atlantic Group. The masses are angrily protesting the American ruling clique's policy of rebuilding German militarism and firmly opposing the policy of war, hunger, and poverty.

The author pointed out: Faced with these growing economic and political difficulties, the representatives of the Western European countries did not dare to accept the American demand at the Rome meeting to further expand their arms expansion plans, especially since U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder warned them that they must abandon the dream of obtaining more financial "aid" from the United States.

The author wrote: Thus, the Rome meeting exposed the further intensification of contradictions within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. The more aggressive and adventurous Washington's foreign policy becomes, the more intense the disputes among the ruling groups of the North Atlantic Group countries. At the same time, this meeting also showed that the United States is trying its best to drag the North Atlantic Group along the path of aggression, without considering any issues.

The author concluded: The aggressors' Rome gathering once again proved that Washington and London needed the representatives of the Anglo-American bloc to deliver hypocritical speeches at the United Nations General Assembly. In this way, they can deceive the people and carry out their sinister schemes of preparing and launching new wars under the guise of false oaths and assurances of peace.

### 苏联真理报评罗马会议：西欧各国人民反对战争政策  打击了美国的“欧洲军”计划

    苏联真理报评罗马会议：
    西欧各国人民反对战争政策
    打击了美国的“欧洲军”计划
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”评论家科里奥诺夫顷撰文评论最近举行的北大西洋集团理事会罗马会议的结果说：尽可能快地拼凑起德国法西斯军队的问题，是罗马战争煽动者会议所讨论的中心问题之一。美国代表团明白地要求罗马会议的参加者在两个月内提出组织包括“强大的德国军队”在内的欧洲军的具体计划。同时，美国代表们又要求北大西洋公约理事会通过决定，命令西欧国家在明年夏天以前提供四十师准备充分的军队，交给艾森豪威尔指挥。艾森豪威尔在会议上发言时，要求北大西洋集团各国把重整军备计划扩大百分之二十五。
    作者继续说：美国主子的要求使得参加会议的国家乱成一团。虽然它们对华盛顿是千依百顺的，可是西欧国家的统治者却不得不看到他们的国家因战争和“马歇尔计划”而削弱的经济基础在重整军备的重担下已经开始崩溃了。被拉入北大西洋集团的国家，越来越显著地面临着经济灾难的咄咄逼人的阴影。但是问题还不止于经济困难而已。各地人民对于北大西洋集团头子们所奉行的罪恶政策的愤怒日益增长。群众愤怒地抗议美国统治集团重建德国军国主义的政策，并坚决反对战争、饥饿和贫穷的政策。
    作者指出：由于面临这些日益增长的经济和政治的困难，西欧国家的代表们在罗马会议上没有敢接受美国要它们把扩军计划再行扩大的要求，特别是因为美国财政部长斯奈德警告他们说，必须放弃自美国获得更多财政“援助”的梦想。
    作者写道：这样，罗马会议就暴露了北大西洋侵略集团内部矛盾的进一步尖锐化。华盛顿的外交政策愈是富于侵略性和冒险性，北大西洋集团国家统治集团间的争吵也就愈厉害。同时，这次会议也显示出：美国正在竭力拖着北大西洋集团沿侵略道路前进，对任何问题都不加考虑。
    作者最后说：侵略者的罗马大集会再一次证明了华盛顿和伦敦是需要美英集团的代表们在联合国大会上发表伪善的演说的。这样，他们才能欺骗人民，才能在关于和平的虚伪誓言和保证的掩饰下，进行他们准备和发动新战争的罪恶勾当。
