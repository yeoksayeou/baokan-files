Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 17th Dispatch: To further promote the million-signature campaign demanding the release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," the initiators of the signature campaign held a meeting on October 18th. Representatives from twenty units, including the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Buraku (Village) Liberation Committee, and other political parties, labor unions, and democratic organizations, attended the meeting. The meeting decided to designate the month starting from the first day of the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" (October 23rd) as "Matsukawa Month" and launch a nationwide signature campaign.

    The signature campaign to support the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" has not only been enthusiastically launched within the National Railway Workers' Union and the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company Workers' Union, to which the innocent defendants originally belonged, but has also expanded to other labor unions. Many farmers, cultural figures, citizens, and even children have participated in this movement. For example, an eight-year-old elementary school student named Naoko Watanabe collected 1,500 signatures.

    In addition, the initiators of the signature campaign have twice helped organize "People's Investigation Teams" regarding the "Matsukawa Incident." Workers, cultural figures, scientists, and students participated in the "People's Investigation Teams." They jointly investigated the truth of the "Matsukawa Incident," attended the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" as observers, and held report meetings in various places to report the truth of the "Matsukawa Incident."
