U.S. Military "Prisoner of War Camp" is a Living Hell
By Piao Yunxue, Korean People's Army Soldier

I was wounded in the thigh by a bullet on October 14th of last year. As I was about to retreat to the rear, I was unfortunately captured about ten li from Jinzhou County in Huanghai Province. After being captured, my clothes were stripped off. We were taken naked through Kaesong and Seoul to Incheon, a journey that took five days, and we didn't eat anything during that time. After arriving at the "camp," because I was seriously injured, I was dragged to a room on the second floor. That room was filled with moans, and the stench of rotting and festering wounds assaulted the nostrils. The horrific situation was beyond imagination. The seriously wounded lying on the ground were piled upon by other seriously wounded; corpses were everywhere, uncollected. Those crawling in through the front door were the seriously wounded, covered in blood after being tortured; those being carried out through the back door were corpses.

Once, when I was dragged to the "torture chamber," I passed by many prison cells. Behind the iron bars of each cell sat people who were skin and bones and pale. Many were Korean civilians.

The female prisoners' cells were places where the American devils raped them.

The American devils dragged me into the "torture chamber." In this room, some prisoners were hanging in mid-air, some were tightly bound and had water poured down their throats, some were branded with red-hot scissors, some were beaten black and blue with clubs, some had gunshot wounds in their chests... One devil threatened me, "Do you see how powerful this place is?" Then they subjected me to electric shock, which nearly killed me.

In the "prisoner of war camp," there were two trucks assigned to special tasks, arriving and departing regularly in the morning and evening. One went to the coast of Incheon, specifically to haul away corpses; the other carried prisoners out to be shot.

In the "camp," gunfire and miserable screams never stopped. One comrade in my cell, just because he pointed to his mouth with his bony finger to ask for food, was stabbed to death by an American devil. During evening prayers, many were shot to death simply because they were too injured to get up. I also saw many prisoners forced to do hard labor at the Incheon pier. Some were loaded onto ships by the American devils and taken to Japan.

I was forced to do hard labor at the Incheon pier at night when I broke free from the heavily guarded perimeter, disguised myself as a beggar, and escaped back.

    美军“俘虏收容所”是一座活地狱
    朝鲜人民军战士  朴云学
    我在去年十月十四日因为大腿中弹受伤，正要退回后方时，在离黄海道今州郡十里的地方不幸被俘。被俘后，衣服被剥光了。我们裸体的经由开城、京城，被押送到仁川，路上一共走了五天，才达到目的地。在这期间，一点东西也没有吃到。到了“收容所”后，因为我负了重伤，被拉到二楼的一间屋子里，那间屋子里充满了呻吟的声音，人身上溃烂伤腐的臭味刺激着鼻孔，悲惨的情况简直不能想像。倒在地上的重伤者身上，又被堆上了其他的重伤者；到处是没有收拾起的尸体。从前门爬进来的是被拷问后鲜血淋漓的重伤者，从后门搬出去的是尸体。
    有一次，我被拉到“拷问室”的时候，从许多牢房前面经过，每间牢房的铁栅后面坐着的，都是皮包骨头、脸色苍白的人们，有许多是朝鲜老百姓。
    女俘虏的牢房，是美国鬼子们强奸的场所。
    美国鬼子把我拉到“拷问室”里。在这屋子里，有的俘虏被吊在半空，有的紧紧地捆作一团被灌了水，有的被烧红的剪刀所烙伤，有的被棍棒打得遍体鳞伤，有的胸口受了枪伤……。一个鬼子威吓我说：“你看到了这里的厉害么？”接着就对我施用电刑，弄得我死去活来。
    “俘虏收容所”里，有担任特殊任务的两辆卡车，早晨、傍晚定时出入。一辆开向仁川海岸，专门装走尸体；一辆装俘虏出去枪杀。
    “收容所”里，枪声和悲惨的叫喊，从没有停止过。和我同牢房的一个同志，只因为用瘦得只剩骨头的手指指着自己的嘴，要东西吃，就被美国鬼子用刀刺死。晚祷的时候，大家因为伤重不能起身，就被枪杀的也不少。我也看到在仁川埠头被强迫做苦力的许多俘虏。有些被美国鬼子装上船开送到日本去了。
    我是被迫夜间在仁川码头做苦力时，脱出了戒备森严的警戒线，化装成乞丐，逃回来的。
