    Strive to Thoroughly Correct the Errors in Popular Literature and Art Work
        Wang Yaping
    In the past two years, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, popular literature and art work in Beijing has produced many works and has a considerable foundation in terms of organization, education, and creation. These achievements should be affirmed. Of course, there are also shortcomings. However, this article cannot be regarded as a review of the entire work or the entire leadership, but only from the perspective of myself (a person more responsible for this work) and some comrades who work closely with me. I believe that we have serious shortcomings. We have not stood on the proletarian standpoint to promptly and conscientiously examine the shortcomings and errors existing in popular literature and art work. Because most of us comrades are from petty-bourgeois backgrounds, we have a strong petty-bourgeois consciousness and often use the "inspiration" method to lead the work. This has resulted in the lack or abandonment of ideological leadership in specific work, the failure to seriously carry out ideological struggle, the growth of ideas of boasting, complacency, and arrogance, and the formation of a crude and shoddy style in creation. In some places, we have surrendered to the old forms, constantly made political errors, and spread bad influences among the masses.
    We once put forward the slogan "Seize the Feudal Literary and Art Position" and did some concrete work. However, we lacked serious investigation and research on the specific situation of the feudal literary and art position in Beijing, which led to blindness in our work. In creation, we had the idea of "only seeking harmlessness," thinking that as long as there is no poisoning, we can write and publish. In script writing, we thought that as long as it can be performed, it is better than the old feudal superstitious plays. We even mistakenly believed that the masses were not conscious enough and had not reached the point of eating "steamed buns," so it was not bad to give them "corn buns." These wrong ideas of lowering artistic thought and accommodating backwardness are wrong and cannot be tolerated. We often console ourselves with the large number of works, thinking that writing more is better than not writing. This is not a sincere attitude of serving the people with our works, but putting personal interests above the interests of the Party and the people, and using writing to express personal wrong ideas. I myself have this kind of wrong thinking, and it is manifested as crude and shoddy creation. Gradually, there also grew tendencies to emphasize technique and ignore political content, such as "as long as the play can be performed," "as long as the poetry is smooth," "as long as the novel can be told," and "as long as the folk art can be sung."
    I did not take the lead in launching a serious struggle of criticism and self-criticism against these confusions in literary and artistic thought and erroneous tendencies in a timely manner. This has led to the fact that you write yours, I write mine; one sets up a stall here, and another sets up a stall there; free publication, free printing, etc. We do not understand how to lead with proletarian Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, we cannot form a strong leadership core, and we condone the spread of feudal artistic thought and petty-bourgeois consciousness. The editor of the "Literary Criticism" weekly of Xinmin Daily even vainly attempted to "dominate the literary world," publishing extremely absurd and reactionary articles under the false name of "removing erotic toxins from old literature," but in reality spreading erotic examples; the novel "Mother and Son," which was written from a petty-bourgeois standpoint about the transformation of the woman Yao Rong, was serialized in "Meng Ya" (a supplement of Xinmin Daily); many dispensable works were published continuously; "Mass Poetry" published my own "Angry Rocket" and Comrade Sha Ou's "Donkey Doctor" and other works with political errors. In this way, the publications and newspapers were treated as private gardens for individuals and friends to express their works. All this fully proves that ideological leadership is not strong, and that extreme liberalism, petty-bourgeois consciousness, and remnants of feudal thought have invaded our ideological field in popular literature and art work.
    Another mistake manifested in our thinking is looking down on some professional literary and art workers and having antagonistic emotions towards them. We believe that only we are engaged in popular literature and art, and professional literary and art workers are specifically engaged in non-popular literature and art. This is because we do not have a correct understanding of Mao Zedong's policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we lack a correct understanding of the relationship between popularization and improvement, which has created this "sectarian bias." Under the control of this kind of thinking, we cannot effectively cooperate closely with experts, and we cannot absorb the opinions and help of experts to improve popular literary and art works and better develop popular literary and art work. Individual comrades have attacked others in front of the masses and at lectures. Some used a satirical tone to say: "New poetry is unrhymed, lined up, with dashes, added dots, uneven." Some even said: "They don't approve of the works I write, and we don't approve of the works they write." Ignoring the truth that only the masses can approve of works, they regard works as their private property. This is looking down on the masses, making literature and art deviate from the actual needs and the needs of the people. As a Communist Party member writer, failing to stand firm and fostering this kind of wrong thinking is truly intolerable.
    We have had relatively good cooperation with artists in the opera world, and we have achieved certain results. Peking Opera "Generals and Ministers Make Peace" is a successful example of cooperation; many drum verses have been modified by skilled artists, and the effect of singing them is even greater; in Ping Opera, new scripts have also been produced and the music of Ping Opera has been improved through cooperation. In the process of these business cooperation improvements, we have not consolidated and promoted these achievements. Myself and some comrades cannot humbly, earnestly, and deeply study folk art forms. Sometimes we learn some things superficially, thinking that we understand, but we don’t really understand, so we cannot use folk art forms well, absorb their excellent traditions, and further promote them. On the artist side, although training courses have been held and ideological education has been carried out, they have not been done well enough. In particular, the mistakes that occur in their creation and performance cannot be criticized and corrected in a timely manner, and there is a lack of political and ideological guidance in ordinary times, which has formed a self-composed and self-singing free-flow phenomenon, unable to jump out of the circle of old forms, and the works lack ideological content.
    We attach importance to cooperation in the areas of worker and peasant mass literature and art. We have organized and mobilized them to create, produced better popular literary and artistic works, and carried out literary and artistic propaganda activities in coordination with political tasks. The shortcoming is that myself and some comrades actually have very little contact with the workers and peasants, and our concrete help to them is not enough. I myself have not been to factories and suburbs in Beijing for more than two years, and I have not made friends with workers and peasants. Of course, there is no cooperation, and there is no deep experience of their lives, thoughts, and feelings, and no learning of their rich language, so how can we write works that correctly express the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers? We do not pay enough attention to their immature works, so we cannot help them process and improve them, so that the creation of mass literature and art has a budding but cannot be well developed. This is a serious mistake of being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses.
    We cannot contact experts well, and we do not contact the masses well. As a result, we cannot see far, think deeply, and contact a wide range of things. We are complacent and cling to our small circle. We cannot improve, and we cannot go deep. "We are a little fluttery!" Under such circumstances, it is difficult to produce good works with flesh and blood and ideological content in terms of popular literary and artistic creation. Many works have also made political mistakes.
    I myself am not enthusiastic about political life, and I do not study policies in detail. What is reflected in my works is that the ideological content is not strong. At the same time, I am satisfied with the use of old forms, but I am not familiar with or understand the real advantages of old forms, and I cannot develop and improve them in folk forms. I often just wave my hand and call it a work. In fact, it is not a work, it is irresponsible crude manufacture. Without a serious creative attitude, the work cannot play the role of educating the people, but harms the youth, allowing them to learn from bad works. We review manuscripts reflecting the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and there are more than 40 articles with different authors and the same content. "Singing and Singing" receives more than 600 manuscripts per month, and the literary supplements and weeklies of "Xinmin Daily" receive more than 1,500 manuscripts per month, of which very few can be used. One of the reasons is that we write casually, and everyone follows suit. This serious phenomenon of misleading ourselves and others is very terrible.
    Actually, analyzing the popular literary and artistic creation of the past two years, there are few good ones and many bad ones. There are many "fillers" and few creations. One is nominally using old forms, but actually filling them with old tunes, such as "Twelve Months," "Four Seasons Song," "Five Watches Tune," "Meng Jiangnu Cries at the Great Wall Tune," and so on. These old tunes and old forms were mostly created in feudal society and are suitable for expressing sad and melancholy emotions. It is simply not appropriate to fill them with the content of new things and the lives of new characters. The emotions do not match, and it is difficult to hear. One is copying old patterns. For example, if there is "Three Sons-in-Law Celebrating Birthday," then there is "Five Sons-in-Law Celebrating Birthday"; if there is "Three Daughters Praising Husband," then there is "Five Daughters Praising Husband" and "Nine Daughters Praising Husband"; if there is "Little Son-in-Law," then there is a "Old Son-in-Law". Copying back and forth, we cannot get out of that set, forming a generalization of works, without fresh breath. One is writing new content according to the old format of drum lyrics, no matter what, we must be constrained, and we cannot break through the old form. Some use some old words, stereotypes, and old routines to describe new characters, which vulgarizes "popularization" and naturally distorts the image of the working people. For example, what is it like to use clichés such as "乌云" (black clouds - referring to a woman's hair), "almond eyes," "cherry mouth," and "swaying willow" to describe the women of today's new society? This is surrendering to the old form and lacking new ideas, an anti-realist creative method. If we do not use healthy and pure language and use fresh techniques to express new things, the result will inevitably lead us into the quagmire of formalism.
    If we examine popular literary and artistic works from the perspective of theme and thought, they seem even more empty, poor, and pale. Why does this phenomenon occur? It is because we are not familiar with the things expressed in the theme, we do not contact them enough, and we do not understand them deeply enough. Without enough observation, experience, and understanding, the works we write are generalized, without new content, and without fresh, lively, and touching power.
    Some works are remakes of newspaper news or remakes of other people's existing works. We call such works "translations." Since they are said to be "translations," there is no question of ideology. Because we are getting something for nothing, the theme is discovered by others, the thought is the thought of others, and the characters and stories are created by others. We are just changing the novel or news into lyrics or scripts, changing the form. If we really have literary and artistic accomplishment and are serious and responsible, it is of course very good to adapt it better than the original. What is most undesirable is the kind of irresponsible random changes and translations. For example, there are many people who casually write and casually translate the same theme, such as "Seven Little Heroes," "Guo Junqing," and "New Things and New Ways". Isn't that wasting your own and other people's time!
    Some works are rewritten from old drum lyrics, and we call that works of "bringing forth the new from the old." If this work is done well, it is very meaningful. If it is not done well, and we accommodate the rhyme of the original work, and we neither improve it ideologically nor develop it in form, then it is meaningless. It even preserves the original feudal colors, low-level descriptions, and vulgar words. This is all because we do not have a correct understanding of folk art forms and do not have a serious attitude, which produces no small evil consequences.
    A portion of the works are crudely manufactured, lacking ideology, and even distorting the image of characters, making political errors. The "Angry Rocket" I wrote is a representative of this type. The creative motivation of this thing was to attempt to summarize the reality of Beijing's resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and to focus on expressing the great power of the people. However, I did not understand the thoughts and feelings of workers, students, peasants, and working people, and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid to Korea enough, and I did not have a deep enough understanding of them. I also did not have enough experience with the policies, so I could only arbitrarily fabricate this thing with my own fantasy. Therefore, I concentrated workers, students, peasants, and the People's Liberation Army in Tiananmen Square to express their strength, and I also pulled the image of fighting special agents and catching landlords to Tiananmen Square. The content of this solemn theme became a place to express petty-bourgeois consciousness, emotions, and imagination. It was really to the extent of "flying around and making noise" like a rocket. The result was distorting reality, misinterpreting policies, and creating some chaotic language. This shows that writing things from the standpoint, viewpoint, and methods of the petty bourgeoisie will inevitably lead to such serious errors.
    I and many comrades always think that we are courageous in rushing to complete tasks and courageous in writing. However, rushing to complete tasks does not mean that we are cooperating with political tasks. In fact, we are lagging behind the tasks. We wrote many innocuous and dispensable works under the banner of rushing to complete tasks. The reason is that we do not pay enough attention to political tasks in ordinary times, and we do not investigate or understand what impact the Party's policies have had on the masses, what changes have taken place, and what new problems there are. We just write with subjective "enthusiasm." As a result, we did not rush to complete the task well, and we showed incompetence and ignorance in politics.
    The root cause of these serious shortcomings and errors, as Comrade Qiao Mu pointed out, is that "there is a fairly strong petty-bourgeois tendency in the current literary and artistic work, which hinders the progress of literary and artistic work." As Comrade Zhou Yang pointed out, "Because the leadership of literary and artistic work has relaxed or abandoned the leadership of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and abandoned the work of criticizing, struggling, and transforming the thoughts of all non-working classes, this has given a great gap for bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts to occupy the leading position in literary and artistic work." To resolutely, quickly, and promptly overcome and correct these shortcomings and errors, we must first transform the thinking of the leading cadres of popular literary and artistic work, firmly stand on the position of the proletariat and the position of the Party to engage in literary and artistic work and creative activities; constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism, thoroughly eliminate harmful petty-bourgeois consciousness, residual feudal consciousness, and residual sectarian thoughts; and earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. In our work, we must create experience, summarize experience, improve our leadership ability, and, step by step and in a planned way, seize the feudal literary and art position together with literary and art experts and establish a new literary and art position; critically absorb the essence of folk art and learn the new language of the working people to enrich ourselves, cultivate ourselves, and further create a new national style, and write works that praise and express the new life and new things of the great motherland and the working people, as well as the noble qualities of heroic models; conduct creation with a serious attitude, correct the free and easy style of crudeness and anti-realist creative methods; and strictly rectify the already formed popular literary and art teams (such as the Mass Literary and Art Creation Research Association, amateur art schools, etc.), and carry out ideological education and ideological transformation; and clean up, review, and study the existing popular literary and artistic works, commend the good ones, criticize the bad ones, and seek further development and improvement. Only in this way can popular literary and artistic work unfold a new look, a new and lively atmosphere, achieve the goal of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and complete the important tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people.

    为彻底纠正通俗文艺工作中的错误而奋斗
        王亚平
    北京市的通俗文艺工作，两年来，在毛泽东文艺思想指导下，在组织、教育工作和创作方面，产生了不少作品，有了相当的基础，这成绩是应该肯定的。当然也不是没有缺点。不过我这篇文章还不能作为整个工作或整个领导的检讨，而只是就我个人
    （一个在这工作中比较负责的人）及一部分同我工作较接近的同志来谈。我以为我们是有严重缺点的，我们没有站在无产阶级立场上，来及时认真地检查通俗文艺工作中存在的缺点和错误。因为我们这些同志，大都是小资产阶级出身，存在着浓厚的小资产阶级意识，常常用“灵感”式的方法来领导工作。这样就造成在具体工作中缺乏或放弃了思想领导，不能严肃地开展思想斗争的错误，增长了夸功、自满、自大的思想，形成创作上粗制滥造的作风。在某些地方投降了旧形式，不断地发生政治上的错误，在群众中散布了不良影响。
    我们曾提出“夺取封建文艺阵地”的口号，也作了一些具体工作。可是对于北京封建文艺阵地的具体情况缺乏认真的调查、研究，在工作上就产生了盲目性。在创作上，我们有“只求无害”的想法，以为只要没有毒害就可以写，可以发表。在剧本写作上以为只要写出来能演，总比老的封建迷信的戏好。甚至还错误地以为群众觉悟不够，还不到吃“馒头”的程度，给他们“窝窝头”吃也就不差。这些降低艺术思想，迁就落后的想法是错误的，不能容许的。我们常常以作品量多而自慰，以为多写比不写好。这不是以作品为人民服务的真诚态度，是把个人利益摆在党的利益、人民利益之上，以写作来表现个人的错误思想。我自己有这种错误思想，而且表现为创作上的粗制滥造。慢慢地还滋长了“戏只要能演”，“诗歌顺口就行”，“小说要能说，曲艺要能唱”等等的偏重技术，忽视政治内容的倾向。
    对于这些文艺思想上的混乱，错误倾向，我没有及时带头地展开批评与自我批评的严肃斗争。这就造成了你写你的，我写我的；这里搞一摊子，那里搞一摊子；自由发表，自由印行等等事实：不懂得用无产阶级毛泽东文艺思想来领导，不能形成坚强的领导核心，纵容了封建艺术思想及小资产阶级意识的传播。新民报“文艺批评”周刊的编者竟妄想“称霸文坛”，发表了假“清除旧文学中的色情毒素”为名，而以传播色情实例为实的，极端荒谬而有反动思想的文章；站在小资产阶级立场写妇女姚瑢转变的“母与子”小说竟在“萌芽”上（新民报副刊）连载；不少可有可无的作品连续发表；“大众诗歌”刊载了我自己的“愤怒的火箭”和沙鸥同志的“驴大夫”等有政治错误的作品。这样，就把刊物、报纸当成了私人、朋友表现自己作品的园地。这一切都充分证明了思想领导不强，在通俗文艺工作中产生了极端的自由主义，小资产阶级意识和封建思想残余侵进了我们的思想领域。
    表现在我们思想上的另一种错误，是瞧不起某些专业文艺工作者，跟他们有对立的情绪。认为只有我们这些人才是搞通俗文艺的，专业文艺工作者是专门搞不通俗文艺的。这是我们对毛泽东文艺为工农兵服务的方针没有正确的认识，对于普及和提高的关系缺乏正确的了解，才造成这种“门户之见”。在这样的思想支配下，就不能切实地和专家紧密合作，不能吸收专家的意见和帮助来提高通俗文艺作品，更好地开展通俗文艺工作。有个别同志在群众面前，讲演会上，攻讦别人。有的用讽刺的口气说：“新诗是无韵、分行、带杠、加点、高低不平。”有的竟说：“我写的作品他们不批准，他们写的作品我们也不批准。”竟忽略了作品只有群众才能批准的真理，把作品看成自己的私有物，这是瞧不起群众，使文艺脱离实际需要、人民需要的具体表现。做为一个党员作家，竟不站稳立场，滋长了这种错误思想，真是到了不能容忍的地步。
    对于戏曲界的艺人，我们合作得比较好，也有一定的成绩。京剧“将相和”是合作成功的例证之
    一；不少鼓词，经过有技术的艺人修改后，唱出去效果更大；评戏方面，也在合作中产生了新剧本，改进了评戏的音乐。在这些业务合作改进的过程中，我们没有巩固、发扬这些成绩。我自己和某些同志，不能虚心地认真地深入地学习民间文艺形式，有时枝枝节节地学一些，自以为懂了，却没有真懂，也就不能很好地运用民间艺术形式，吸收它的优良传统，进一步地发扬光大。在艺人一方面，虽说办过讲习班，进行过思想教育，都做得很不够。特别是对于他们的创作、演唱中发生的错误，不能及时地批评、纠正，平素又缺乏政治、思想指导，形成了自编自唱的自流现象，跳不出旧形式的圈子，作品缺乏思想性。
    对于工人、农民群众文艺方面的合作，我们是重视的。组织发动过他们创作，产生了较好的通俗文艺作品，配合政治任务进行了文艺宣传活动。缺点是，我自己和某些同志，实际上和工人、农民群众来往很少，具体地帮助他们很不够。我自己到北京两年多，没有到过工厂和郊区，也没有和工人、农民作朋友，当然说不到合作，说不到深刻地体验他们的生活、思想、感情，学习他们丰富的语言，又怎能写出正确表现工农兵形象的作品呢？对于他们的不成熟的作品，不够重视，也就不能帮着他们加工、提高，使群众文艺创作有了萌芽而不能很好地发展，这是严重的脱离实际，脱离群众的错误。
    既不能很好地联系专家，又没有很好地联系群众，结果是看得不远，想得不深，接触的面不广，沾沾自喜地抱住自己的小圈子，提不高，深入不下去，“有点飘飘然了”！在这样情况下，表现在通俗文艺创作方面，就难以产生有血有肉，有思想内容的好作品。有不少作品，还犯了政治上的错误。
    我自己对于政治生活热情不高，对于政策不精细地研究，反映到作品里的就是思想性不强。同时满足于旧形式的运用，却又对旧形式的真正优点不熟、不懂，不能在民间形式上发展、提高，往往信手一挥，就算作品，其实那不是作品，是不负责任的粗制滥造。没有严肃的创作态度，作品就起不了教育人民的作用，反而贻害了青年，让他们向坏作品学习。我们审查反映抗美援朝的稿件，一次就有作者不同，作品内容相同的四十余篇之多。“说说唱唱”每月收到稿件六百余篇，“新民报”文艺副刊和周刊每月收到稿件在千五百篇以上，其中能用的很少，其原因之一就是我们随便写，大家跟着随便写。这种自误误人的严重现象是十分可怕的。
    实际分析一下二年来的通俗文艺创作，是好的少，坏的多。“填”的多，创作的少。一种是名义上运用旧形式，实际上是按旧调调填上去的，如“十二个月”“四季歌”“五更调”“孟姜女哭长城调”之类。这些旧调调，旧形式，多半是在封建社会里创造出来的，适宜于表达悲伤、忧郁的感情，硬填上新事物的内容，新人物的生活，怎么也不相称，情调不合，叫人听了很难过。一种是抄袭旧套子，如有了“三婿上寿”，再来个“五婿上寿”；有了
    “三女夸夫”，再来个“五女夸夫”“九女夸夫”；有了“小女婿”，再翻一个“老女婿”。抄来翻去，出不了那一套，形成作品的一般化，没有新鲜气息。一种是按着鼓词的旧格律，写进新的内容，无论如何也得受拘束，不能把旧形式突破。有的用上一些旧词、滥调、老套套去形容新人物，那就把“通俗化”庸俗化了，自然也歪曲了劳动人民的形象。比如用“乌云”（女人头发）“杏子眼”“樱桃口”“风摆柳”等陈词滥调来形容今天新社会的妇女，还成什么话呢？这是向旧形式投降，没有新思想，反现实主义的创作方法。不用健康的纯洁的语言，不用新鲜的手法来表达新事物，其结果必然走进形式主义的泥坑。
    从主题思想上，来检查通俗文艺作品，那就更显得空洞、贫乏、苍白了。为什么发生这种现象呢？就是对于表现主题的事物不熟悉，接触得不够，认识得不深。没有足够的观察、体会和了解，因而写出的作品就一般化，没有新内容，也就没有新鲜、活泼的感人的力量。
    有些作品是报纸新闻的翻版，或是别人既成作品的翻版，我们叫这样的作品为“翻译”。既说是“翻译”，也就说不上思想性了。因为自己是不劳而获，主题是别人发现的，思想是别人的思想，人物故事是别人创造的，只不过把小说、新闻改成唱词、剧本，变换一种形式罢了。如果真正有文艺修养，认真负责，改编的比原作好，那当然也很好。最要不得的是那种不负责任的乱改、乱翻。如“七个小英雄”“郭俊卿”“新事新办”等同一主题，就有好多人去随便写，随便翻，那不是浪费自己和别人的时间！
    有些作品原是旧鼓词的改写，而我们管那叫做
    “推陈出新”的作品。这个工作，如果做好了，是很有意义的。如果做不好，迁就原作的辙口韵脚，既未在思想上加以提高，也未在形式上将它发展，那就没有意义。甚而保存下原有的封建色彩，低级的描写手法和庸俗的词句。这都因为对民间艺术形式，没有正确的认识，没有严肃的态度，就产生不小的恶果。
    有一部分作品，是粗制滥造，没有思想性，甚至歪曲人物形象，在政治上犯错误的作品。我写的
    “愤怒的火箭”正是这一类型的代表。这篇东西的创作动机是企图概括北京抗美援朝的现实，集中地表现人民的伟大力量。可是自己对于工人、学生、农民、劳动人民的思想、感情、抗美援朝的运动，都了解得不够，认识得不深，对于政策又没有足够的体会，这就只有凭自己的空想来任意地虚构这篇东西，于是，把工人、学生、农民、人民解放军都集中到天安门来表现力量，把打特务、捉地主的形象也拉到天安门前。这个庄严的主题内容，变成了抒发小资产阶级意识、感情、想像的场所，正似火箭一样，真到了“乱飞乱响”的程度，结果是歪曲了现实，曲解了政策，制造了一些混乱的语言。这说明用小资产阶级的立场、观点、手法去写东西，就不可避免地会产生如此严重的错误。
    我和不少同志，总以为我们勇于赶任务，勇于写作。但赶任务并不等于配合了政治任务，实际是赶在任务的后边。我们打着赶任务的旗号，写了很多不痛不痒可有可无的作品，原因是平素对政治任务关心不够，也不调查、了解党的政策在群众中发生了什么样的影响，有什么样的变化，有什么样的新问题。单凭主观的“热情”，动笔去写，结果任务没有赶好，在政治上表现了低能和无知。
    产生这些严重的缺点、错误的根本原因，正如乔木同志所指出的“在目前文艺工作中存在着相当浓厚的小资产阶级倾向，以致妨碍了文艺工作的前进”。也正如周扬同志指出的“由于文艺工作的领导上，放松或放弃了毛泽东文艺思想的领导，放弃了对一切非工人阶级的思想批判、思想斗争和思想改造的工作，这就给了资产阶级、小资产阶级思想以很大的间隙来占领文艺工作的领导地位”。我们要坚决、迅速、及时地克服、改正这些缺点和错误，就必须首先改造通俗文艺工作领导干部的思想，坚定地站在无产阶级的立场、党的立场，来从事于文艺工作，从事创作活动；不断地开展批评自我批评，彻底清除有害的小资产阶级意识，残存封建意识及残余宗派思想；认真学习马列主义、毛泽东文艺思想。在工作中，要创造经验，总结经验，提高领导能力，有步骤有计划地和文艺专家一道夺取封建文艺阵地，建立新文艺阵地；批判地吸取民间艺术的精华，学习劳动人民的新语言，来丰富自己，培养自己，进一步创造民族的新风格，写出歌颂、表现伟大祖国和劳动人民的新生活、新事物以及英雄模范的高贵品质的作品；用严肃的态度，进行创作，矫正粗制滥造的自由主义作风和反现实主义的创作方法；把已组成的通俗文艺队伍（如大众文艺创作研究会，业余艺术学校等）进行严格的整顿，展开思想教育和思想改造；清理、审查、研究已有的通俗文艺作品，表扬好的，批评坏的，求得进一步的发展和提高。只有这样，通俗文艺工作，才能展开一副新的面貌，新的生动活泼气象，达到文艺为工农兵服务的目的，完成党和人民交给我们的重要任务。
