Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 3rd: According to TASS, Romanian Deputy Foreign Minister Bunușu received the US Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to Romania on November 28th and handed him a note from the Romanian government protesting US interference in internal affairs. The note stated: US President Truman signed the "Mutual Security Act of 1951" in October, which stipulates the appropriation of $100 million to subsidize counter-revolutionaries currently hiding in the Soviet Union, Romania, and other people's democracies, or fascist elements and war criminals who have fled from these countries, in order to direct them to engage in espionage activities against these countries or to incorporate them into the armed forces supporting the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Therefore, this bill not only openly expresses the US government's hostile policy towards the Romanian people, but also shows that the United States is openly and shamelessly interfering in Romania's internal affairs. The Romanian government firmly protests against this aggressive measure of the US government against Romania and peace-loving countries, and declares that the US government must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this action.

    罗外交部照会美政府抗议美干涉罗内政
   【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚外交部副部长布纳修在十一月二十八日接见美国驻罗马尼亚临时代办，把罗马尼亚政府抗议美国干涉内政的照会一件递交给他。照会说：美国总统杜鲁门今年十月间签署了“一九五一年共同安全法”，其中规定拨款一亿美元，津贴现在潜居在苏联、罗马尼亚和其他人民民主国家的反革命分子，或者从这些国家逃出去的法西斯分子和战犯，以便指挥他们对这些国家从事间谍活动，或把他们编入支持北大西洋侵略集团的武装部队中。因此，这个法案不仅露骨地表示了美国政府对罗马尼亚人民实行敌对的政策，而且也表明了美国公开而无耻地干涉罗马尼亚的内政。罗马尼亚政府坚决抗议美国政府这种针对罗马尼亚和爱好和平的国家的侵略措施，并且声明：美国政府应对这种行动的后果负全部责任。
