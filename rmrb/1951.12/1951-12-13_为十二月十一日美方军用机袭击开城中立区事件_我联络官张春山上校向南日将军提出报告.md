Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 12th: Report by our Liaison Officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, to our Chief Delegate, General Nam Il, regarding the United Nations military aircraft attack on the Kaesong Neutral Zone on December 11th:
    Between 00:45 and 01:00 hours on December 11th, United Nations military aircraft circled, bombed, and strafed the Lilling-ri area (approximately three kilometers northwest of Kaesong) in the neutral zone for approximately fifteen minutes, carrying out three strafing runs and dropping one bomb and two incendiary bombs (one of which did not ignite), constituting an encroachment on the neutral zone. I immediately notified the other side at 01:35 and 03:50 on the 11th to send personnel for a joint investigation. At 09:00, the other side's Liaison Officers, Colonel Kinney and Colonel Mulley, along with assistants and news and photography reporters, arrived at the scene. Our side, consisting of myself and Colonel Chai Chengwen, along with assistants, conducted the investigation together. Personnel from both sides inspected the following evidence from south to north:
    (1) Nine machine gun bullet holes, from which three bullet heads were recovered. The other side's Liaison Officer, Colonel Kinney, acknowledged that these were half-inch caliber bullet heads. There were also many other bullet holes, but due to the wide dispersion and the obscuring frost, they were difficult to find. The other side considered the evidence sufficient and ceased further inspection.
    (2) One bomb crater, approximately three meters in diameter and one meter deep, with explosion marks and numerous bomb fragments on the nearby ground and embankment.
    (3) Two incendiary bomb craters. In one crater, the bomb had exploded, leaving burn marks and a large fragment nearby (approximately one meter long and forty centimeters wide, with the markings "100 LB INCEND BOMB AN·M4713 NP·FILLING" and a strong gasoline smell). One detonator (marked "LOT3138—44NOSE BOWD, FYSE, ANM126A"). In the other crater, the bomb was buried deep in the ground, with only the tail visible and had not exploded.
    (4) Numerous bullet casings were found on the road. The other side's Colonel Kinney acknowledged that these were half-inch caliber bullet casings. Personnel from both sides jointly questioned the local resident, Kim Soon-geun, and our on-duty sentry at the time, Hwang An-ming. Kim Soon-geun stated that he was awakened by the strafing and bombing sounds in the middle of the night, and when he went outside, he saw the burning flames. The aircraft then returned twice. Hwang An-ming stated that while he was on duty, an empty vehicle drove along the road, after which the aircraft circled, strafed, and dropped bombs. At 10:10, the investigation was completed when the other side considered the evidence sufficient. Personnel from both sides then proceeded to the Panmunjom meeting site. The other side's Liaison Officer, Colonel Kinney, immediately acknowledged that an offensive incident violating the agreement had occurred last night in the area investigated by both sides, and that the bombs used were American-made, but still claimed that an investigation would need to be carried out among U.S. Air Force personnel. I immediately pointed out to him that the evidence had proven that the other side's military aircraft had violated the agreement by attacking the Kaesong Neutral Zone between 00:45 and 01:00 on the 11th, and lodged a verbal protest, demanding that the other side handle this incident responsibly.

    为十二月十一日美方军用机袭击开城中立区事件
    我联络官张春山上校向南日将军提出报告
    【新华社开城十二日电】我方联络官张春山上校，为十二月十一日联合国军军用飞机袭击开城中立区事件向我方首席代表南日将军的报告。
    十二月十一日零时四十五分至一时正，联合国军军用飞机在中立区开城附近之丽陵里地区（开城西北约三公里）盘旋轰炸扫射约十五分钟，计先后扫射三次，投掷炸弹一枚，燃烧弹两枚（其中一枚未焚毁），构成了侵犯中立区事件。我当即于十一日一时三十五分、三时五十分两次通知对方派员共同调查。九时对方联络官肯尼上校、穆莱上校及助理人员与新闻和摄影记者等到达肇事地区，我方则由我和柴成文上校与助理人员等会同进行调查，双方人员均由南向北先后察看了下述证据：
    （一）机关枪弹穴九处，并由弹穴中检出弹头三枚，均经对方联络官肯尼上校承认系半英寸口径弹头。另有弹穴多处。因散布面甚宽，且被晨霜掩盖不易发现。对方认为证据已足，未再察看。
    （二）炸弹坑一处，直径约三公尺，深约一公尺，附近地面及堤沿上有爆炸痕迹及炸弹破片甚多。
    （三）燃烧弹，弹坑两处，其中一处弹体已爆炸，附近有燃烧痕迹并在附近发现较大之破片一（长约一公尺，宽约四十公分，上有100，LBINCEND BOMB AN·M4713 NP·FILLING 字样，汽油味甚浓）。炸弹雷管一（上有“LOT3138—44NOSE BOWD，FYSE，ANM126A”字样）。另一处弹体深埋土中，仅露弹尾，尚未爆炸。
    （四）在公路发现弹壳多枚，均经对方之肯尼上校承认，系半英寸口径子弹弹壳，双方人员并共同询问了当地居民金淳根及当时我方之值班哨兵黄安明。据金淳根称：他在半夜被扫射声及炸弹声惊醒，出门看时即见到燃烧的火光，后飞机又飞来两次。黄安明称：他在值班时公路上有一辆空车驶过后，飞机即盘旋扫射并投掷炸弹。十时十分，调查于对方认为证据已足时完毕。双方人员均至板门店会场内，对方联络官肯尼上校当即承认，昨晚在双方调查过的地区曾发生过违犯协议的进攻事件，所用炸弹是美国制造的，但仍声称须在美军空军人员中进行调查。我当即向其指出证据已证明对方军用飞机在十一日零时四十五分至一时违犯了协议进攻开城中立区，并向其提出口头抗议，要求对方认真负责地处理这一事件。
