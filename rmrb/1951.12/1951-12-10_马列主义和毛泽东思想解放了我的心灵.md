    Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought Liberated My Soul
    Gao Shangren, General Secretary of the Beijing YMCA

    I have been a Christian for over thirty years. In October 1950, in pursuit of truth, I voluntarily joined the Political Research Institute of the North China People's Revolutionary University (hereinafter referred to as "Revolutionary University") for study. This study at the Revolutionary University was a clear dividing line in my personal life history. Before entering the Revolutionary University, my mind was bound by a series of ideological problems, and I was spiritually like a sinner wearing shackles. Since entering the Revolutionary University and undergoing study, my thinking has gradually been liberated by the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism. After making an ideological summary, I felt relaxed and happy, with a clear and cheerful mind, sweeping away years of accumulated depression in my chest. Whenever I chat with old friends, I often say, "This study at the Revolutionary University is the happiest thing in my life."

    I Re-Recognized Myself

    For many years, I always thought I was a "good person." I often thought: my life is well-behaved. Naturally, I haven't done anything rebellious, and even many small things, I am very aware of keeping myself clean. What makes me even more proud is that I am a secretary of the YMCA. The YMCA is a noble and detached religious organization. It serves society with the aim of "not to be served, but to serve."

    After studying at the Revolutionary University, I clearly understood what "standpoint" and "viewpoint" are, who are the reactionary rulers, and what imperialism is. Furthermore, I related my job to the relationship with imperialism, the reactionary ruling class, and the exploiting class. Then I suddenly realized that my previous assessment of myself was completely wrong.

    The big red building where the organization I served, the Beijing YMCA, was located, was "donated" by the American imperialist Wanamaker! Who in Beijing doesn't know that the YMCA is an organ of American imperialism for carrying out cultural aggression? On the surface, it pretends to be noble, but in fact, it is a thorough organ for spreading pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American toxins. The better I did my job in such an organization, the greater my sin. Because I was serving imperialism. Take Yu Rizhang, the once-famous leader of the YMCA, for example, he was a loyal running dog of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, and at the same time, he had very close relations with American imperialism. In those years, I extremely admired him; I admired his so-called slogan of "saving the country through personality." This shows that my previous work was only faithfully serving as a lackey for imperialism and the reactionary ruling class! All the efforts of the past thirty years have essentially been for my own fame and fortune, and I have never thought about what vital interests those works have for the broad masses of working people! I have never served the people at all, let alone wholeheartedly serve the people!

    Through study, I realized that my character is a despicable, selfish individualist, and at the same time, I realized what is the noblest quality of mankind. I initially established a worldview of serving the people. This is a great comfort to me in my deep shame.

    What is the Noblest Quality of Mankind

    In a certain stage of my life, I once hoped that one day I could see "angels," because I thought the quality of "angels" was the noblest. I also fantasized about "becoming an immortal," because I thought that becoming an immortal would be both carefree and able to save all living beings, which would be great! I also made a vow to "enter the realm of saints and transcend the ordinary," because sages are the most respected. For a long time, I sincerely hoped that I would have a noble quality.

    In the past, my standard for judging people's qualities was to see whether they had "morality" and "knowledge," and whether they were Christians who shared my beliefs. In the past, the most respectable people in my view were amiable "gentlemen," elegant and unrestrained scholars and writers, handsome and generous youths, and pure and beautiful young girls.

    After studying at the Revolutionary University, I determined that a good person, a sage, an "angel," and the most respectable person are only those who can achieve "selflessness, wholeheartedly serving the people."

    Although the imagined "angels" are pure and pleasing, for thousands of years, they have never rescued the broad masses of working people in suffering from the depths of misery. What "contributions" have they made to the broad masses of working people? Writers, scholars, heroes, and sages, if they have not actually solved the basic problems of the broad masses of working people, they do not deserve to enjoy that glorious title. Young men and women, no matter how handsome and beautiful, if they do not have the ideological consciousness of serving the broad masses of working people, they are only decorations and playthings of the exploiting class! Now I have realized that there is only one yardstick for judging people's good, bad, good, and evil: that is "selflessness, wholeheartedly serving the people"!

    I lived in the Revolutionary University for more than nine months and came into contact with many Communist Party members. I observed them, studied them, and approached them. I experienced that they are truly as Stalin said, "made of special materials"!

    At the Revolutionary University, the first time I was moved to tears was when I heard Tong Jiali's report on the "Tunnel Warfare." Tong Jiali is a young cadre from a poor peasant background. He once persisted in the tunnel with the enemy for seven days and nights. In such a long time, he only ate half a cornbread. When he was thirsty, he and his comrades drank each other's urine. But they always insisted on fighting the enemy. He is a handsome young man, and his body was also ruined by long-term engagement in the struggle for people's liberation. He also has the love of parents and wife, but his arduous struggle is for the liberation of all the Chinese people. When listening to his report, I really couldn't hold back my tears. Am I the most easily moved to tears? I looked around at other classmates, and many people were wiping their tears with their handkerchiefs like me.

    Look at the poem-like historical facts in the biographies of Chinese Communist Party martyrs! Look at Liu Hulan, Zhao Yiman, and the heroes trapped in the Shangrao concentration camp... Their magnificent deeds left to the people for thousands of years that can be sung and cried! Looking around us, at the style of work and life of the Communist Party members we come into contact with! We will naturally understand that the Communist Party members are really "made of special materials."

    From Now On, I Will No Longer Worry About the Future of Mankind

    I am a person who likes to fantasize. From the age of seventeen or eighteen, I often fantasized. As I got older, I accepted Christian thought, and my spirit was once excited. I thought that if all human beings in the world believed in Christianity, all the problems of mankind could be solved. The "September 18th Incident" gave me a great stimulus; I asked myself: "When will all the people in the world believe in Christianity?" After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I served as a soldier, seeing the pain of the wounded. I have also witnessed the tragedy after enemy bombing many times. For many years, I have seen the filth of the reactionary government. I began to feel sad for the future of mankind. I thought that there would always be wars between countries, and human civilization would be destroyed by war. Whenever I thought of the Communist Party, I didn't believe it either. At that time, I believed that all people are guilty and that parties are selfish. Ideologically, there was really no way out. Therefore, a kind of inextricable boredom and sadness occurred in my mind.

    For many years, influenced by imperialist cultural aggression, I always thought that the United States was the paradise on earth. I wanted to go to the United States to see the land of happiness. In 1946, I did go to the United States. I have been to the slums of black people and the "protected" areas of red people, I visited the strike conference of meatpacking workers, I saw murder cases and robberies in the newspaper every day, I realized the insecurity of the lives of the American people, I heard the American political scandals told to me by Americans, I knew that only a few rich vampires could enjoy happiness in the United States. After understanding the truth of American society, I realized that this country with churches everywhere was nothing more than this, so I became even more disheartened. Therefore, I often pondered: Human society is really a "Saha world" with more suffering than happiness, life is meaningless. It is better to be unborn than born, human civilization will be destroyed by war, and the future of mankind is tragic. Therefore, my mind is always shrouded in clouds of sorrow, and I am depressed and lifeless.

    Through study, I recognized the socialist Soviet Union and the essence of internationalism, and also recognized the imperialist United States and the essence of cosmopolitanism. I saw everything in my motherland after liberation, and at the same time, I associated it with the happiness of the Soviet people's lives. I know that it is not religion but politics that determines human happiness. I still believe in Christianity, but I believe that Christianity can only contribute to the present society through innovation. From the initial study of Marxism-Leninism, I understood that the law of social development determines the coming of the Great Harmony world—the inevitable realization of communism. After recognizing this, I no longer worry about the future of human society.

        I Found the Truth - The Truth Set Me Free

    In the ten years before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, every early winter, I would usually lead a group of children to the slums of Beijing to "investigate" poor households. The purpose was to enlighten the "service" thoughts of young people and donate money to "relieve" poor compatriots. In each investigation, I thought: Those poor children are starving and freezing, and they have no opportunity to be educated in their lives. Are these children born "guilty"? Looking at the children of those wealthy families I led, each of them was well-fed and clothed and went to school every day. Is this fair and reasonable? Of course not. But what to do? No one has ever interfered with young ladies and wives showing their bare thighs, but when those rickshaw pullers bare their backs, the police will scold and beat them. Is this right? Wrong! But what else can be done? People who rob because of life are caught by the police and either imprisoned or executed, but those bureaucrats and warlords who embezzle millions of dollars can live in peace and prosperity. It is really "those who steal a hook are punished, and those who steal a country become princes." Is this fair? Unfair! What if it's unfair? So in those years, I often had two questions in my mind: The first question was: "Is there truth in the world?" The second question was: "What is the truth?" I have talked about these two questions with many people, but I have never received a satisfactory answer until I participated in the study at the Revolutionary University. After this study, I recognized Soviet society, I saw the thriving atmosphere of the new China after liberation, and I realized that the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is the truth.

    This truth is reflected in life: from the meeting in Tianqiao, Beijing, to fight against bullies, from the scene of the poor and hired peasants turning over after the land reform, from the victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, from the lives of revolutionary cadres, I saw the truth. I had never seen the truth in old China and the United States. Today I have found the truth in the new China. The truth sets me free.

    I think: Marxism-Leninism is like a microscope, through which we can see the problems of human society clearly. Marxism-Leninism is also like a compass, through which we can know the correct direction of human social development. Marxism-Leninism is also like a telescope, through which we can see the beautiful prospects of human society. Marxism-Leninism is even more like a happy seed, planting it in the garden of our thoughts, it will surely germinate, grow, blossom, and bear fruit. Through Marxism-Leninism, we can recognize the value and meaning of life. Marxism-Leninism is the theory of proletarian revolution, through which, all the oppressed humanity in the world will inevitably gain liberation and freedom.

    马列主义和毛泽东思想解放了我的心灵
    北京基督教青年会总干事  高尚仁
    我信仰基督教三十多年。一九五○年十月，为了追求真理，我自动参加了华北人民革命大学（以下简称革大）政治研究院学习。这次在革大的学习，是我个人生活史上一条很清楚的分界线。在未入革大以前，我的心灵被一连串的思想问题捆绑着，在精神上像是一个全身佩枷带锁的罪人。自入革大经过学习，我的思想就逐步地被马列主义的科学真理解放了。一直到作了思想总结之后，在精神上，我一扫胸间多年以来的积郁，感觉到轻松愉快，心旷神怡。每和老朋友们闲谈时，我常说：“这次在革大学习，是我生平最大的一件快事。”
    我重新认识了自己
    多年以来我总以为自己是一个“好人”。常想：自己的生活是规规矩矩的。大逆不道的事自然没有作过，就是很多小事，也都是很知道洁身自好的。更使我自豪的是：我是一个基督教青年会的干事。青年会是一个清高的、超然的宗教的团体。它是以“非以役人，乃役于人”的宗旨来服务社会的。
    经过在革大的学习后，我明确认识了什么是“立场”、“观点”，哪些人是反动统治者，什么是帝国主义。更进一步地联系到自己的工作岗位同帝国主义、反动统治阶级和剥削阶级的关系。于是我恍然大悟，明白了已往对自己的估价是完全错的。
    我所服务的团体——北京青年会所住的那座大红楼，就是美帝国主义分子万那美克“捐助”的呀！北京人谁不知道青年会是一个美国帝国主义进行文化侵略的机关？在表面上它装得很清高，但事实上，它是地地道道的一个散播亲美、崇美、恐美毒素的机关。在这样的机关里，我把工作搞得越好，我的罪恶也就越大。因为我是为帝国主义服务的。就以赫赫一时的青年会领袖余日章来说，他是蒋匪介石的忠实走狗，同时又是和美帝国主义有非常密切关系的人。那些年我反而极端地敬仰他；更钦佩他的所谓“人格救国”的口号。这说明我以往的工作，只不过忠实地为帝国主义、反动统治阶级做了一条狗腿！三十年来的一切努力，实质上都是为了自己的名利而工作，从未想到那些工作对广大劳动人民有什么切身的利害关系！根本就没有为人民服务过，更不用说全心全意地为人民服务了！
    经过学习，我认识到自己的品质是一个卑鄙的、自私自利的个人主义者，同时也认识到什么是人类最高贵的品质。我初步建立了为人民服务的人生观。这是我在万分惭愧之中的极大的安慰。
    什么是人类最高贵的品质
    在我生平的某一阶段中，曾经希望有这么一天：我可以看见“天使”，因为我以为“天使”的品质是最高贵的。我也曾幻想过“成仙得道”，因为我以为成了仙，既可以逍遥自在，又可以普渡众生，那够多好！我也曾立过志愿，想“入圣超凡”，因为圣贤是最被人尊敬的。我曾长期地、恳切地盼望过我有一个高贵的品质。
    以往我鉴定人的品质标准，是要看他是否有“道德”、“学问”，是否一位和我的信仰相同的基督教徒。从前我认为最可敬爱的人，是蔼然可亲的“谦谦君子”，风雅洒脱的学者文豪，英俊豪放、丰采悦人的青年和纯洁美丽如花似玉的妙龄少女。
    经过在革大学习以后，我认定：一个好人、圣贤、“天使”和最可敬爱的人只有那能做到“大公无私，全心全意为人民服务”的人。
    想像中的“天使”虽然皎洁可喜，但是千万年来，她们未曾把苦难中的广大劳动人民从水深火热中拯救出来。她们对广大的劳动人民又有什么“功劳”可言呢？文人、学者、豪杰、英雄、大圣、大贤，这些人若是在实际上没有解决过广大劳动人民的基本问题，他们就不配享有那种光荣的称号。青年和少女，无论怎样的英俊美妙，若是没有那为广大劳动人民服务的思想意识，那只是剥削阶级的点缀和玩物而已！现在我已认识到鉴定人的好、坏、善、恶的标尺只有一个：那就是“大公无私，全心全意为人民服务”！
    我住在革大九个多月，接触过不少共产党员，我观察他们，研究他们和接近他们。我体验到他们真如斯大林所说的，是“由特种材料制成的”呀！
    在革大，我第一次被感动得流泪的，是听了佟嘉励的“地道战”报告。佟嘉励是一位贫农出身的青年干部。他曾有一次在地道里和敌人坚持七天天夜。在那样长的时间里，他只吃了半个窝窝头。渴了的时候，和同志们互相喝小便。但是他们始终和敌人坚持斗争。他是一位英俊的青年，因为长期从事人民解放的斗争把身体也拖坏了。他也有父母妻子之爱啊，但是他的艰苦斗争，却是为了全中国人民的解放。在听他报告的时候，我的眼泪实在是抑制不住了。我是一个最易流泪的人么？我前后左右地看看其他同学，也有不少人是和我一样地在用手帕揩着他们的泪水。
    看看中国共产党烈士传上那些像诗一样的史实吧！看看刘胡兰、赵一曼，上饶集中营被困的英雄们……他们为人民所留下的万载千秋可歌可泣的壮烈事迹吧！更放眼看看我们的周围，我们所接触的共产党员在工作上和生活上的作风吧！我们自然就会了然，共产党员真是“由特种材料制成的”了。
    从此我再不为人类的前途忧虑
    我是一个喜欢幻想的人。从十七八岁我就常幻想。年事稍长，我接受了基督教思想，我的精神曾有过一度兴奋。我以为世界上所有的人类若都信奉了基督教，人类的一切问题都可以解决了。“九一八”事变给了我一个极大的刺激；我自己问自己：“什么时候全世界的人才能都信了基督教呢？”抗日战争爆发以后，我曾为伤兵服务过，看到伤兵的惨痛。我也曾多次目睹敌机轰炸以后的惨状。我多年见到反动政府的污浊。我开始为人类的前途悲哀了。我以为国际间将永远战争相循，人类的文明必将因战争而毁灭。每每想到共产党，但也是不相信的。我那时认定了：凡人都是有罪的，党派都是自私的。思想上真是走头无路。于是，在我的心灵中就发生了一种不得解脱的烦闷和忧伤。
    多年来受了帝国主义文化侵略的影响，所以一向以为美国是地球上的极乐世界。满想到了美国就可以看到幸福之邦。一九四六年我果然到了美国。我到过黑人的贫民窝和红人的“保护”区，我参观过包肉工人的罢工大会，我天天在报纸上看到凶杀案和抢劫案，我认识到美国人民生活的不安，我听过美国人讲给我听的美国政治黑幕，我知道在美国能享福的只是那几个有钱的吸血鬼。我了解了美国社会的真情之后，我才知道，这个教堂林立的国家，情况不过如此，于是我更心灰意冷起来了。因此我常常在思索：人类社会真是苦多乐少的“婆娑世界”，人生是没有意义的。有生不如无生，人类的文明将要被战争毁灭，人类的前途是悲惨的。因此我的心灵总是被愁云所笼罩着，郁郁无生趣。
    经过学习，我认识了社会主义的苏联和国际主义的本质，也认识了帝国主义的美国和世界主义的本质。我看到解放以后祖国的一切情形，同时我联想到苏联人民生活的幸福。我知道决定人类幸福的不是宗教而是政治。我还依然信仰基督教，但我认定基督教只有革新，才能对现社会有所贡献。从马列主义的初步学习中我懂得了社会发展的规律决定了大同世界的来临——共产主义的必然实现。认清楚了这点之后，我再不为人类社会前途忧虑了。
        我找到了真理——真理使我
    得以自由
    在抗日战争爆发以前的十几年间，每年冬初，我都照例带领一批少年儿童到北京的贫民区去“调查”贫户。为的是启发少年人的“服务”思想而捐款“救济”贫苦同胞。在每次的调查中我都想：那些贫苦的孩子们饥寒交迫，一生没有受教育的机会。难道这些孩子生下来就“有罪”么？再看我带领着的那些富裕家庭的儿童，个个丰衣足食，天天上学。这是公平合理的么？当然不是。但是怎样办呢？小姐太太们光着两条大腿从来没有人干涉过，而那些洋车夫一赤背，警察就要打骂他们。这是对的么？不对！但又怎样呢？被生活所迫而行劫的人，被警察捉住，不是被监禁就是被枪决，但那些贪污累万的官僚军阀们呢，反可以安富尊荣。真所谓“窃钩者诛，窃国者侯”。这是公平的么？不公平！不公平又怎样？所以那些年，在思想上我常存在着两个问题：第一个问题是：“世界上有真理么？”第二个问题是：“真理是什么？”我曾和不少人谈过这两个问题，但是一直到参加革大学习之前从来没有得到满意的答案。这次学习之后，我认识了苏联社会，我看见了解放后新中国欣欣向荣的气象，我才大觉大悟地明白了马列主义和毛泽东思想的科学理论就是真理。
    这真理体现在生活中：从北京天桥斗争恶霸的大会上，从土地改革以后贫雇农翻身的情景里，从抗美援朝的胜利中，从革命干部的生活中，我都看见了真理。我在旧中国和美国从来没看见过真理。今天在新中国我找到了真理。真理使我得以自由。
    我觉得：马列主义像是一架显微镜，通过它，我们可以把人类社会的问题看得清清楚楚。马列主义又好像罗盘，通过它，我们可以知道人类社会发展的正确方向。马列主义也像是一架望远镜，通过它，我们可以看见人类社会美丽的远景。马列主义更好像一粒愉快的种籽，把它种在我们思想的园地上，它必发芽，生长，开花，结实。通过马列主义，我们可以认识到人生的价值和意义。马列主义是无产阶级革命的理论，通过它，全世界被压迫的人类必然得到解放和自由。
