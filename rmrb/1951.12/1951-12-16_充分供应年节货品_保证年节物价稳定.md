    Illegal Merchants in Northern Jiangsu Take the Opportunity to Drive Up the Price of Alkali
    State-owned Department Stores Actively Fight Against Them
    The Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China Department Store Company has transferred a large amount of soda ash to ensure the supply of civilian soda ash for the Spring Festival and stabilize the market price of soda ash.
    Due to the limited source of soda ash, the company once reduced the supply of civilian soda ash to the market in order to take care of the needs of industrial soda ash. A few illegal merchants took the opportunity to drive up market prices. In places such as Dongtai, Yancheng, and Huaiyin, the market price of soda ash once reached about 800,000 yuan per bag at the highest, which was more than twice the normal selling price. The New Year's holidays are coming, which is the peak season for the sale of soda ash. In order to ensure the supply of soda ash, the Northern Jiangsu Department Store Branch has allocated the large amount of soda ash transferred to various branches for processing and remanufacturing soda, which is widely supplied.
