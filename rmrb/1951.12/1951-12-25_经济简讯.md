    Economic Briefs
    ▲ Wang Liquan, a lecturer at the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, has achieved initial success in experimenting with "branching barley" based on the principles of the Michurin school of thought. Branching barley is cultivated using seedling transplantation. This year, they transplanted barley seedlings like rice seedlings, and as a result, 20% of the barley plants grew branches, some with double ears, some with triple ears, and the most with eight ears. Each plant generally had more than 50 grains, with a maximum of 72 grains. The yield of this branching barley is about 50% higher than that of ordinary barley.
    ▲ Jiangxi oranges are now on the market in large quantities. This year, except for Nanfeng mandarin oranges, which had a normal harvest due to the off-year cycle, red oranges and kumquats in Sanhu, Suichuan, and other places have had bumper harvests. It is estimated that Jiangxi province will produce 6 million jin of oranges this year, an increase of 30% over last year. Currently, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in the orange-producing areas of Jiangxi Province are actively purchasing oranges and supplying farmers with various textiles, general merchandise, etc.
    ▲ This year, the sugarcane harvest in the Tuo River basin sugar-producing area in southern Sichuan increased by 20% compared to last year, which greatly promoted the development of the sugar industry.
    This year, more than 270,000 mu of sugarcane were planted in the Tuo River basin. Thanks to the supply of improved sugarcane varieties and fertilizers provided by the People's Government to sugarcane farmers, the yield per unit area of sugarcane fields has generally increased. This year, the sugarcane fields in Neijiang County yielded an average of 2,800 kilograms of sugarcane per mu, an increase of 10% to 20% over last year. The best-cultivated sugarcane fields in Zizhong County achieved a maximum yield of more than 7,000 kilograms per mu. Moreover, the improved sugarcane varieties have a high sugar content, and the sugar production in the Tuo River basin this year will increase compared to last year.

    ▲浙江大学农学院讲师汪丽泉，根据米丘林学说的原理，试验“大麦分枝”已得到初步成功。分枝大麦，是用育苗移植法育出的。今年，他们把大麦的幼苗像栽水稻一样移植了一遍，结果有百分之二十的麦株长出了分枝，有的长双穗，有的长三穗，最多的八穗。每株麦粒一般是五十多粒，最多的七十二粒。这种分枝大麦的产量，比普通大麦约高百分之五十。
    ▲江西橘子已经大量上市。今年除南丰蜜橘因逢淡年平收外，三湖、遂川等地的红橘、金橘都丰收了。据估计江西全省今年产橘六百万斤，比去年增加百分之三十。现在，江西省产橘地区的国营贸易公司和合作社，正配合收购工作大量供应农民各种布匹、百货等。
    ▲川南区沱江流域产糖区今年甘蔗收成比去年增加了百分之二十，这大大促进了制糖业的发展。
    沱江流域今年种甘蔗二十七万多亩。由于蔗农获得人民政府供给的优良蔗种和肥料，蔗田的单位面积产量大都提高了。内江县的蔗田今年每亩平均收甘蔗二千八百公斤，比去年增产了一成到二成。资中县耕作最好的蔗田，一亩最高产量达七千多公斤。而且良种甘蔗含糖量高，今年沱江流域的糖产将比去年增加。
