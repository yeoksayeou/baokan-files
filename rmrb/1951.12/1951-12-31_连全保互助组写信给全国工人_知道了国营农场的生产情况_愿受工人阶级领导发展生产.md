    Lian Quanbao Mutual Aid Team Writes to Workers Nationwide
    Learning About State Farm Production, Wishes to Develop Production Under the Leadership of the Working Class
    Dear Elder Brothers, Workers Nationwide: We are farmers living in the mountains. In late September, Lian Quanbao, a comrade from our team (a labor model from Shanxi Province), was invited to the capital to attend the second National Day ceremony and visit state farms and mechanized farming schools. After he returned, he told us everything he had seen and heard. Our eyes were opened, and we felt we had much to say to you.
    Comrade Lian Quanbao told us that state farms and mechanized farming schools use machines for all their work on the land, including manure spreaders, tractors, seeders, harrows, and harvesters. The machines come in various sizes, such as ten-row seeders, three-row seeders, and so on. Therefore, machines can be used on both large and small plots of land, saving effort and increasing production. He personally witnessed an earthmoving machine excavating the foundation for five rooms in no time. Because the people on the farms use machines for cultivation, they have extra time for study, exercise, and recreation, and they are very happy. Their children have access to nurseries and can drink milk, and they are all fair and chubby.
    Hearing these things, we felt both ashamed and excited. After listening to Chairman Mao, our thirteen households organized ourselves and improved our farming techniques. This year, we used single-blade plows for plowing and sliding hoes and weeding hoes for weeding seedlings. As a result, we harvested more grain than in the past, which we thought was a great achievement. Now we realize that we are still far behind. We used to think that our remote mountain valley was not suitable for machines. Now we know that small machines can be used for cultivation in mountain valleys. In the past, our vision was too narrow.
    We were extremely excited to hear about the happy lives of people after moving from individual production to collective production. Xin Lai'an said, "We farmers have a saying, 'Ten days without rest,' which means that a farmer who cultivates ten mu of land cannot rest for even one day out of the year. If we use machines, we can save time and have time for study and recreation. How wonderful!" Woman Liu Xiaonü said, "A good daughter-in-law fears a wet baby. With nurseries, women's productive labor is so happy!"
    Now everyone knows that to become prosperous and happy, we must organize ourselves, move from individual to collective production, and use machines for production. But machines cannot be made without you workers. You are the guides leading farmers to prosperity and happiness, and we must follow you! Our mutual aid team is still far from collectivization! We must work even harder. We have already formulated our production plan for next year, ensuring increased production of industrial raw materials, more grain, improved farming techniques, and increased yield per unit area. We hope you will help us, and we are willing to work together to achieve national industrialization. We shake hands tightly with you.

    连全保互助组写信给全国工人
    知道了国营农场的生产情况  愿受工人阶级领导发展生产
    亲爱的全国工人老大哥们：我们是住在山里的农民。九月底，我们组里的连全保同志（是山西省的劳动模范）被邀请到首都参加第二届国庆典礼，参观了国营农场和机耕学校。他回来后，把所闻所见一点一滴地告诉了我们。我们的眼睛明亮了，觉得有好多话要和你们说。
    连全保同志告诉我们，国营农场和机耕学校在土地上作活都用机器，有撒粪机、拖拉机、播种机、耙地机、收割机等。机器有大有小，如十行播种机、三行播种机等等。所以大块小块土地都能用机器，一样省力，又能增产。他亲眼看见一架起土机，不大一会儿，就把五间房的基地挖好了。农场里的人们因为用机器耕作，挤出了时间，学习、运动、游戏，精神十分愉快。他们的小孩有托儿所，能吃到牛奶，都是白白胖胖的。
    听了这些话，我们又惭愧又兴奋。我们这十三户人家，听了毛主席的话，组织起来了，提高了耕作技术，今年犁地使用了单把犁，锄苗用滑耧、耘锄，所以打得粮食比过去多了些，我们就认为高的了不得了。现在才知道还差的太远哩。我们以前总认为我们这深山沟，那能用机器？现在我们才知道山沟可用小机器耕作。过去我们的眼光真太短了。
    我们听了由个体生产走向集体生产以后人们的美满生活情况，兴奋极了。辛来安说：“咱农民有句俗话，叫‘十不歇’，就是说一个农民种十亩地，一年三百六十五天就一天不敢歇，要是使上机器，省出工夫，也能学习和娱乐，多美啊！”妇女刘小女说：“好媳妇怕个尿娃娃，有了托儿所，妇女生产劳动多幸福！”
    现在大家都知道要想富裕幸福，必须组织起来，从个体走向集体，使用机器生产。可是机器离了你们是造不出来的，你们是使农民走向富裕幸福的带路人，我们一定要跟你们走！我们这互助组现在离集体化还差得远哩！我们一定要加倍努力干。我们已经订了明年的生产计划，保证增产工业原料，多打粮食，改进耕作技术，提高单位面积产量。希望你们帮助我们，并愿咱们一同努力达到国家工业化。紧紧和你们握手。
