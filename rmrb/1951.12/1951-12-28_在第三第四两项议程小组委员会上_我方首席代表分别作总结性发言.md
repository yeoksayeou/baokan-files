Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 27th. At the third and fourth agenda item subcommittee meetings of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 27th, our chief delegates Generals Xie Fang and Li Xiangchao, who attended the two group meetings, respectively made concluding remarks, denouncing the consistent delaying tactics adopted by the other side on the third and fourth agenda items over the past thirty days. The two speeches are as follows:

	Our Chief Delegate General Xie Fang's Speech at the Third Agenda Item Subcommittee

	Today marks exactly one month since we began discussing the third agenda item. Due to your insistence on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs, we have not yet reached a complete agreement on the third agenda item. I feel it is necessary to review the course of the debate since the discussion of the third agenda item to determine the responsibility for delaying the negotiations.

	On November 27th, the general assembly began discussing the third agenda item. We put forward five principles. You put forward seven principles. We advocate that after the realization of a military armistice, a higher-level political conference should be convened quickly, please note, quickly, to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops in order to completely peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Only a complete peaceful resolution of the Korean issue can truly prevent the possibility of the recurrence of hostile acts; and any stable and effective military armistice is only a transitional state, which cannot solve (nor should it be expected to solve) all issues related to preventing the recurrence of hostile acts. Therefore, we believe that there is no need to discuss such broad issues as neither side increasing military forces during the armistice in a strict military armistice negotiation, let alone adopt measures such as free inspection of the other side's rear, which interfere in the other side's internal affairs. We believe that you, who have consistently refused to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops in the armistice negotiations, are even less qualified to make such a request. Since you believe that the issue of withdrawing foreign troops is a political issue and should not be discussed in military armistice negotiations, how can you raise such obvious political issues of interfering in the other side's internal affairs in military armistice negotiations? However, contrary to your past assertion that military armistice negotiations should not involve political issues, you insist on stipulating in a military armistice negotiation that neither side should increase military forces and that free inspections should be conducted in the other side's rear. Thus, a deadlock appeared in the general assembly shortly after the discussion of the third agenda item began.

	It should be pointed out that your position in this deadlock is illogical and untenable. However, because we saw that you were really afraid of the growth of our military strength, in order to reach an armistice in Korea and break the deadlock in the meeting, we made concessions to your demands and put forward two supplementary suggestions on December 3rd, suggesting that neither side should bring any military forces and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea into Korea under any pretext during the armistice; and in order to prevent rear inspections from involving the other side's internal affairs, it was suggested that neutral countries form a supervisory body to supervise both sides' compliance and implementation of this clause at the rear ports agreed upon by both sides. All fair-minded people will know that our proposal is more thorough than your proposal, and the method of supervision by neutral countries that we have proposed is the only feasible method that can effectively supervise both sides' implementation of this clause on the one hand, and does not involve internal affairs on the other hand.

	Our two supplementary suggestions on December 3rd broke the deadlock in the general assembly, and only because of this did both sides agree to transfer the discussion of the third agenda item to the current subcommittee. But in addition to being unwilling to give up the unreasonable demand for direct inspection of our rear, you then raised the issue of your need for rotation and replenishment, and maliciously said that our proposal was intended to achieve the purpose of withdrawing all foreign troops by means of attrition. Don't you think that this proposal applies to both sides? Since it is intended to exhaust you, doesn't it also intend to exhaust us? It is very clear that the purpose of your saying this is to justify your insistence on rotation and replenishment; and rotation and replenishment, no matter how you explain it, will inevitably increase military strength, that is to say, fundamentally violate the principles you yourself have put forward. Thus, nine days passed until December 12th, when you finally put forward a counter-proposal, reluctantly agreeing to the principle of neutral countries inspecting the rear, but still unreasonably insisting on rotation and replenishment. There is no doubt that the delay of these nine days from December 3rd to December 12th is entirely your responsibility.

	In order to seek agreement and achieve an armistice, we quickly put forward a counter-proposal on December 14th. We made concessions to your demands on the issue of rotation. However, you still disregarded our concessions, refused to express your attitude towards our counter-proposal, and insisted on the unreasonable demands of interfering in our internal affairs that we have always opposed. After dragging on like this for nine days, until December 23rd, you put forward another proposal that, although contained some elements to break the deadlock, still insisted on your unreasonable demands of interfering in our internal affairs. Similarly, there is no doubt that the delay of these nine days from December 14th to December 23rd is entirely your responsibility.

	We deeply know that you are very afraid of the growth of our air force strength. It is precisely in order to dispel your concerns that we agreed to explicitly stipulate that no combat aircraft shall enter Korea from outside Korea, and agreed that when one party in the Military Armistice Commission proposed by your side requests the neutral nations supervisory institution to investigate violations of the agreement, the neutral nations supervisory institution shall be responsible for carrying out inspections. If the purpose you are pursuing is indeed a ceasefire that is as stable and effective as possible, you should no longer be wary of the growth of our air force strength and insist on your absurd demands that interfere in our internal affairs.

	People can see that we are doing our best to advocate that both sides can reach a stable and effective armistice. Our sincerity and goodwill are manifested in the specific proposals we have put forward in the past month. But despite the fact that we have put forward such solemn proposals, you have unscrupulously said these days that our combat aircraft can enter Korea from outside Korea at any time during the armistice, so you must insist on the unreasonable demand to restrict certain equipment of our side. I want to remind you that your words contain the danger of fundamentally overturning the basis of our negotiations. I ask you, if all the promises we have made are worthless, why are you still negotiating with us? What is the use of reaching an agreement through negotiations? If you want to continue negotiations, I ask you not to make such remarks again.

	It is even more untenable to use this kind of argument to defend your demand to interfere in our internal affairs. On the one hand, you disregard our solemn guarantees and insist on your demand to interfere in our internal affairs, thinking that the so-called balance of military power in Korea cannot be maintained without interfering in our internal affairs; but on the other hand, you insist that you have the right to conduct unlimited rotation and replenishment, that is, the right to bring new military forces from outside Korea into Korea without restriction. I ask you to explain in clear and specific language how unlimited rotation and replenishment will not increase military strength. You insist that it is your administrative convenience, which does not require consultation, that you can bring in spirited military personnel from outside Korea without restriction to replace exhausted military personnel in Korea, and transport unused brand-new war equipment from outside Korea to replace obsolete war equipment used in Korea; but on the other hand, you believe that our right to conduct or not conduct certain equipment in Korea must be permitted by you and reconnaissance must be carried out in the air. This strange logic of yours is only possible when you consider yourselves to be the victors. But I must frankly tell you, and all fair-minded people around the world will frankly tell you, that you are not the victors in this war. Your strange logic does not make sense.

	We firmly believe that you are absolutely not allowed to interfere in our right to handle certain equipment in Korea during the armistice. Our airspace is absolutely not allowed to be reconnoitered by anyone. The limit of the so-called rotation that you advocate of bringing spirited military personnel from outside Korea to replace exhausted military personnel in Korea must be negotiated by both sides; and the replenishment of weapons and ammunition from outside Korea is absolutely not allowed during the military armistice. The term "replenishment" itself means increasing the military strength of one party fighting in Korea from outside Korea. You cannot provide any reason to defend your self-contradictory claim.

	This is the basic difference of opinion on the third agenda item and our unwavering position in this difference of opinion.

	You have delayed the meeting for so long, of course you can continue to delay it. But we believe that the issues of our dispute must be made public to the world so that people all over the world know who is delaying the Korean armistice negotiations.

	Our Chief Delegate General Li Xiangchao's Speech at the Fourth Agenda Item Subcommittee

	Since the fourth agenda item subcommittee began on December 11th, we have put forward the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice. However, for sixteen days, you have used various excuses to consistently refuse to accept this completely just and reasonable principle that no one can object to, so that thirty days after the agreement on the second agenda item, the fourth agenda item has still not been reached. This responsibility must be borne entirely by you.

	On December 11th, we put forward the completely just and reasonable principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice. On December 12th, we further proposed the principle of prioritizing the repatriation and release of wounded and sick prisoners of war by both sides after the armistice, as well as the principled suggestions on the time, place and organization for the exchange of prisoners of war. However, you first used the excuse that the release of prisoners should not increase one side's military strength, and then used the excuse that the prisoner of war list must first be exchanged and the International Committee of the Red Cross invited to visit the prisoner of war camps as a prerequisite, and refused to discuss the principles we proposed. The principle of promptly releasing and repatriating prisoners of war is universally recognized as something that belligerents must abide by once hostilities cease. In fact, such a principle should be affirmed by both sides without any discussion, let alone any prerequisites. However, in order to dispel all your excuses and break the deadlock in the meeting, we proposed the exchange of all prisoner of war information on both sides at the meeting on December 18th.

	The prisoner of war information submitted by us is complete and sufficient information on all prisoners of war we held at the end of November. In the information we submitted, according to the nationality of the prisoners of war, their military number, rank, unit and location of the prisoner of war camp were listed in detail in their respective common languages. However, in the list submitted by you, there was no essential identification material at all except for the name spelled in English. However, we did not refuse to discuss and determine the principles because the information you submitted was fundamentally impossible to identify. On the contrary, we continued to insist on immediately affirming the completely just and reasonable principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war by both sides after the armistice. However, you again created various unreasonable and illogical excuses, still attempting to evade this principle that cannot be evaded, making it impossible for the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item to make any progress at all. You used the excuse that the number of your missing persons was greater than the total number of prisoners of war we held, and that the number of your personnel we had captured was greater than the total number of prisoners of war we currently held, and continued to refuse to determine the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war.

	Even you should understand that in any war, there can be no fixed relationship between the number of missing persons and the number of prisoners of war. One party of the belligerents has no right to demand a certain number of prisoners of war from the other party based on the number of missing persons. Under our lenient policy towards prisoners of war, and under our policy of continuously releasing large numbers of prisoners of war during the war, the number of prisoners of war we currently hold is also naturally smaller than the number of your personnel we have captured. You claim that the released prisoners of war did not return to your ranks, but this is enough to prove that people who were forced to participate in the war will not return to the trap after gaining freedom. You also submitted the names of more than a thousand of your personnel, requesting us to inquire about their whereabouts. On December 26th, I have clearly and responsibly given you a reply based on all the materials we have on hand here. We are also continuing to investigate the personnel who have not yet been identified. What other reason do you have to refuse to determine the principle of promptly releasing all prisoners of war by both sides after the armistice?

	In fact, it is you who should provide satisfactory and sufficient explanations for the discrepancies in the numbers. In the list of prisoners of war you submitted to us on December 18th, the actual number of names listed was 1,456 less than the total number of prisoners of war you claimed at the same time. You claimed that these 1,456 prisoners of war were indeed in your prisoner of war camps, but you have not yet submitted the list of these 1,456 prisoners of war. More seriously, as many as 44,205 prisoners of war you transferred to us through the International Committee of the Red Cross were not on the list you submitted on December 18th. You initially claimed that the huge difference of these 44,205 people was because the materials transferred by the International Committee of the Red Cross were untimely materials. Later, you claimed that this difference was because 37,000 of them were residents of South Korea. Initially, you claimed that these so-called 37,000 prisoners of war had been released, shamelessly calling it a fait accompli. Later, you claimed that these 37,000 prisoners of war were still in your prisoner of war camps. The untimely nature of the materials cannot explain the disappearance of more than 44,000 people. Prisoners of war on both sides must be based on the troops to which they belong, and cannot be forcibly detained based on their previous place of residence. These self-contradictory excuses only expose your despicable conspiracy to detain our personnel. What is most intolerable is that you openly claim that you will detain 16,243 of our personnel on the list of prisoners of war you submitted on December 18th. This ugly attempt cannot be concealed by any excuse. Since the fourth agenda item began to be discussed, it is precisely your ugly attempt that has consistently hindered the progress of the meeting. Unless you abandon this ugly attempt, the meeting cannot have any progress.

	In order to enable all prisoners of war on both sides to be released as soon as possible, and in order to realize the ardent desire of the people of the world to achieve the goal of an armistice as soon as possible, I once again suggest that the subcommittee immediately adopt the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice, so as to quickly enter the discussion of specific issues of repatriating prisoners of war.

    在第三第四两项议程小组委员会上
    我方首席代表分别作总结性发言
    【新华社开城二十七日电】在二十七日朝鲜停战谈判的第三、四两项议程小组委员会上，我方出席两组会议的首席代表解方、李相朝两将军分别作了总结性发言，痛斥三十天来对方在第三、四两项议程上所采取的一贯的拖延政策。两个发言如下：
    第三项议程小组委员会我方
    首席代表解方将军的发言
    今天是我们开始讨论第三项议程的整整一个月。由于你方坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求，我们对第三项议程还没有达成全部协议。我觉得有必要回顾一下第三项议程讨论以来争论发展的经过，来确定拖延谈判的责任。
    十一月二十七日大会开始讨论第三项议程。我方提出了五项原则。你方提出了七项原则。我们主张在军事停战实现以后，应该迅速地，请注意，迅速地，召开高一级的政治会议，讨论撤退外国军队问题，以彻底和平解决朝鲜问题。只有彻底和平解决朝鲜问题，才能真正使敌对行为不再有爆发的可能；而任何稳定与有效的军事停战只不过是一个过渡状态，它不能解决（也不应该企望它解决）所有有关阻止敌对行为再起的问题。因此，我们认为没有必要在一个严格的军事停战谈判中讨论双方在停战期间不增加军事力量这样广泛的问题，更不容许采取到对方的后方进行自由视察这种干涉对方内政的措施。我们以为在停战谈判中一直拒绝讨论撤退一切外国军队问题的你方，更没有资格提出这样的要求。你们既然认为撤退外国军队问题是政治问题，不应该在军事停战谈判中讨论，如何又能在军事停战谈判中提出如此明显的干涉对方内政的政治问题来呢？但你们一反过去军事停战谈判不应涉及政治问题的主张，坚持要在一个军事停战谈判中规定双方不得增加军事力量，并到对方后方进行自由视察。这样，第三项议程开始讨论不久，大会就出现了僵局。
    应该指出，你们在这个僵局中所坚持的立场是不合逻辑的，不能自圆其说的。但由于我们看到你方实在是害怕我方的军事力量的增长，为了达成朝鲜的停战，打开会议的僵局，我们向你方主张作了让步，提出了十二月三日的两项补充建议，建议双方在停战期间不得以任何藉口从朝鲜境外进入任何军事力量和武器弹药；并为了使后方视察不牵涉到对方的内政问题，建议由中立国组成监察机构，在双方同意的后方口岸，监督双方对这一条款的遵守与执行。所有公正的人士都会知道我们这个提案是比你方的提案要彻底得多，而我们所提出的由中立国监察的方法则又是一方面能够有效监察双方对这一条款的执行，而另一方面又不涉及内政问题的唯一可行的方法。
    我方十二月三日的两项补充建议打开了大会的僵局，只是因为这样，双方才同意把第三项议程的讨论转移到现在这小组会上。但你们除去不甘心于放弃直接视察我方后方的无理要求外，接着又提出了你方需要轮换与补充的问题，而且恶意地说我们这个提案是意在用消耗的办法达到撤退一切外国军队的目的。你们就不想一想这个提案是适用于双方的，既然意在消耗你方，不是同时也意在消耗我方吗？你们这样说，很显然地其目的在于为你们坚持轮换与补充作辩解；而轮换与补充，不管你们怎样解释，都势不可免地要增加军事力量的也就是说根本违反了你们自己提出的原则的。这样，一直过了九天，到十二月十二日你方才提出了对案，勉强地同意了中立国视察后方的原则，但仍极不合理地坚持轮换与补充。毫无疑问，从十二月三日到十二月十二日这九天时间的拖延，是完全应该由你方负责的。
    为了求得协议，实现停战，我方又迅速在十二月十四日提出了对案。在轮换问题上对你方作了让步。但你方却仍然置我方的让步于不顾，拒绝对我方对案表示态度，坚持我方一直反对的干涉我方内政的无理要求。如此拖了九天，直到十二月二十三日，才又提出一个虽然包含若干打开僵局的因素，但仍坚持你方干涉我方内政的无理要求的提案。同样没有疑问，从十二月十四日到十二月二十三日这九天的拖延完全是应该由你方负责的。
    我们深深知道你们是十分害怕我方空军力量的生长的。正是为了解除你方的这种戒心，我们同意明确规定出不得从朝鲜境外进入任何作战飞机，并且同意你方提出的军事停战委员会中的一方向中立国监察机构提出调查违反协议事件的请求时，中立国监察机构即须负责进行视察。假如你方所追求的目的果真是在于一个尽可能稳定和有效的停战，你方就不应该再对我方空军力量的生长有所戒惧，坚持你们那些干涉我方内政的荒谬要求。
    人们可以看出，我方是竭力赞成双方能达成一个稳定和有效的停战的。我们的诚意和善意表现在一月以来我们历次所提的具体建议上。但尽管我方已提出了如此郑重的提案，你这几天肆无忌惮地说，我方作战飞机在停战期间也随时可以从朝鲜境外进入朝鲜境内，因此你方必须坚持限制我方某种设备的无理要求。我要提醒你，你这种话包含着根本推翻我们谈判基础的危险。我请问你，假使我方所作的一切允诺都无价值，你们为什么还来和我们谈判？谈判达成了协议又有何用？假使你还要继续谈判的话，我请你不要再发表这样的议论。
    拿这种议论来为你方干涉我方内政的要求作辩护，更是站不住的。你们一方面置我方的郑重保证于不顾，坚持你方干涉我方内政的要求，以为不干涉我方内政就不能维持朝鲜境内的所谓军力平衡；但另一方面却坚持你们自己有权进行无限制的轮换与补充，也就是有权从朝鲜境外无限制地进入新的军事力量到朝鲜境内。我要求你用明白具体的语言解释无限制的轮换与补充如何会不增加军事力量。你硬说你方无限制地从朝鲜境外进入士气充足的军事人员，换出朝鲜境内的士气疲惫的军事人员，从朝鲜境外运进没有用过的崭新的战争装备，换出朝鲜境内使用得陈旧的战争装备，不会增加你方的军事力量，是你方的行政便利无须协商；但另一方面你却认为我方在朝鲜境内进行或者不进行某种设备的权利要得到你方的许可并在空中进行侦察。你这种奇怪的逻辑只有在你们自认为是战胜者的情况下才有可能。但我必须坦白告诉你们，全世界所有公正的人士都会坦白告诉你们，你们不是这个战争中的战胜者。你们这种奇怪的逻辑是说不通的。
    我方坚决认为停战期间我方在朝鲜境内处理某种设备的权利绝不容你方过问。我方的领空绝不容许任何人进行侦察。你方所主张的从朝鲜境外进入士气充足的军事人员，换出朝鲜境内士气疲惫的军事人员的所谓轮换的限度必须得到双方的协商；而从朝鲜境外补充武器弹药在军事停战期间则绝不许可。补充一词本身就意味着从朝鲜境外增加在朝鲜境内作战的一方的军事力量。你方提不出任何理由为你们这个自相矛盾的主张辩护。
    这就是第三项议程的基本分歧和我方在这个分歧中不可动摇的立场。
    你方已经把会议拖延了这样久，当然你方还可以继续拖延下去。但我们认为，必须把我们争论的问题公之于世界，让全世界人民知道谁在拖延朝鲜停战谈判。
    第四项议程小组委员会我方
    首席代表李相朝将军的发言
    自从十二月十一日第四项议程小组委员会开始以来，我方就提出了停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则。但是十六天以来，你方却使用了各种藉口，始终拒绝接受这一没有任何人可以反对的完全公正合理的原则，以致在第二项议程达成协议的三十天之后，第四项议程仍然未能达成协议。这一责任必须由你方全部担负。
    十二月十一日我方提出停战后迅速释放和遣送全部战俘的完全公正合理的原则。十二月十二日我方又补充提出双方在停战后优先遣送与释放伤病战俘的原则，以及交换战俘的时间、地点和机构的原则建议。但你方却始则藉口释放俘虏不得增加一方的军事力量，继则藉口必须首先交换战俘的材料并邀请红十字国际委员会访问俘虏营，以作为先决条件，而拒绝讨论我方所提出的原则。迅速释放和遣送战俘的原则是举世公认为交战双方在敌对行为一经停止后所必须遵守的。事实上，这样的一个原则是不需要任何的讨论就应该为双方所肯定的，更谈不到任何的先决条件。但我方为了解除你方的一切藉口，打开会议的僵局，在十二月十八日的会议上提出了双方交换全部战俘资料的建议。
    我方所提交的战俘资料是关于我方在十一月底所收容的全体战俘的完整而充分的资料。我方所提交的资料中，按照战俘的国籍，使用他们所各自通用的文字详细地列出他们的军号、级别、部别和俘虏营的所在地点。但是你方所提交的名单中，却除了英文拚写的姓名以外，根本没有列出任何必需的识别材。可是我方并没有因为你方所提出的资料根本无从识别而拒绝讨论和确定原则。相反地，我们继续坚持立即肯定双方在停战后迅速释放和遣送全体战俘的完全公正合理的原则。但你方却又制造各种不合理、不合逻辑的藉口，仍然企图逃避这一不容逃避的原则，使第四项议程的小组会议根本无从获得进展。你方藉口你方失踪数字大于我方所收容的俘虏的总数，藉口我方所曾经俘获的你方人员的数字大于我方目前所收容的俘虏总数，继续拒绝确定迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则。
    即使你方也应该了解，在任何战争中，失踪数字和被俘数字之间是不可能有任何固定的关系的。交战双方的一方没有任何权利以失踪数字为根据，向对方提出一定数目的战俘的要求。在我们对战俘的宽大政策之下，在战争进行之中就不断地大批释放俘虏的我方政策之下，我方目前收容的战俘的数字也很自然地小于我方所曾经俘获的你方人员的数字。你方声称被释放的战俘并没有回到你们的队伍中去，但是这正足以证明被迫参加战争的人们在获得了自由之后，是不会重新自投罗网的。你方也提出了一千余名你方人员的姓名，要求我方查询他们的下落。我在十二月二十六日已经根据了我们在此地手头所有的材料，明确负责地给予了你方以答复。对于还没有查明的人员，我方也正在继续进行清查。你方更还有什么理由拒绝确定双方在停战后迅速释放全体战俘的原则？
    事实上应该对于数字不符提供满意与充分的解释的正是你方。你方在十二月十八日所提交我方的战俘名单中，实际列出的姓名较你方同时所声称的战俘总数就缺少了一千四百五十六名之多。你方声称这一千四百五十六名战俘确在你方俘虏营中，但是你方却至今还没有交出这一千四百五十六名战俘的名单。更其严重的是你方经由红十字国际委员会转交我方的战俘名单中，竟有四万四千二百零五人之多不在你方十二月十八日交来的名单中。你方起初声称，这四万四千二百零五人的巨大的差额，是因为红十字国际委员会转来的材料是不及时的材料。其后却又声称这一差额是由于其中三万七千人是南朝鲜的居民，起初你方声称这所谓三万七千人的战俘已经释放，无赖地称之为既成事实。其后你方即又声称这三万七千名战俘仍然在你方俘虏营中。材料的不及时，不能解释四万四千多人的消失。双方战俘更必须以他们所属的部队作为标准，而不可能以他们以往的居住地点为根据而强加扣留。这种自相矛盾的藉口只是暴露了你方企图扣留我方人员的卑鄙阴谋。最不能容忍的是你方竟公然声称将扣留你方在十二月十八日所交出的战俘名单中的一万六千二百四十三名我方的人员。这种丑恶的企图是不能以任何藉口加以掩饰的。自从第四项议程开始讨论以来，也正是你方的这一丑恶企图始终阻碍了会议的进展。除非你方放弃这一丑恶的企图，会议是不可能有任何进展的。
    为了双方全体的战俘得以早日获得释放，为了实现全世界人民早日达成停战目标的热烈的愿望，我再度建议小组会立即通过停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则，以便迅速进入遣送战俘的具体问题的讨论。
