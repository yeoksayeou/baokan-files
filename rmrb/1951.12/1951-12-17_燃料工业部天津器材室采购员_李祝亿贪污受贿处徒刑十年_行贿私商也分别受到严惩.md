    Fuel Industry Department Tianjin Equipment Room Procurement Officer
    Li Zhuyi Sentenced to Ten Years for Embezzlement and Bribery
    Bribing Private Merchants Also Severely Punished
    Li Zhuyi, a procurement officer at the Tianjin Equipment Room of the Central Fuel Industry Department, was sentenced to ten years in prison for colluding with private merchants to embezzle and accept bribes, and for coercing other comrades to cover up his crimes. The relevant private merchants were also sentenced accordingly.

    In November 1949, Li Zhuyi facilitated a deal between the Jiaozuo Coal Mine and the Tongheng Stationery and Paper Company in Tianjin, accepting a bribe of 2.1 million yuan. In 1950, Li Zhuyi facilitated three transactions for the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, the Central Fuel Industry Department, and the Dehua Electric Company, accepting bribes totaling 10.07 million yuan. In total, Li Zhuyi accepted bribes of 12.8 million yuan, enabling private merchants to obtain illegal profits of more than 42.68 million yuan. At the end of 1950, during a work appraisal, when comrades asked Li Zhuyi if he had committed any embezzlement or dereliction of duty, he not only flatly denied it but also harbored resentment towards the comrades who had offered criticism, engaging in shameless coercion and intimidation.

    The Tianjin People's Court, based on Li Zhuyi's crimes of embezzlement and intimidation, sentenced him to ten years in prison and confiscated all of his bribe money. Zhang Yingkai, the manager of Dehua Electric Company, a private merchant who colluded with Li Zhuyi, was sentenced to five years in prison by the Tianjin People's Court for the crimes of disrupting finance and speculation in addition to bribery. His illegal profits of 42,685,000 yuan were confiscated. The manager of Tongheng Stationery and Paper Company was sentenced to one year in prison for bribery. The manager of Tianjin Yuda Electric Company, who assisted in the bribery, was released after education, and the bribe money of 500,000 yuan was confiscated.
