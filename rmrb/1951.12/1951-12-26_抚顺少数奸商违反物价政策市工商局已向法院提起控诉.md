To the Editor:
    The vast majority of industrialists and businessmen in Fushun City can thoroughly implement the patriotic pact, improve their business methods, achieve small profits and quick turnover, and thoroughly implement the state's price policy. However, more than 20 private industrial and commercial enterprises, such as Changshengong, Fushundong, Tianxingfu, Jifengyuan, and Qingji Cotton Ginning Industry, have seriously violated the price policy. Among them, some have driven up prices, some have engaged in deception and fraud, and some have violated business regulations in order to seek exorbitant profits. For example, Qingji Cotton Ginning Industry, with a capital of more than 21 million yuan, had been punished by the Industry and Commerce Bureau for raising prices in the past. After the government adjusted prices this time, it raised the price of cotton from 10,500 yuan per catty to 14,000 yuan for sale. Cloth merchant Du Changshan still did not sell cloth at the adjusted price after the government adjusted prices on November 1st. He is the leader of his industry group, and under his influence, merchants in the same industry did not sell at the adjusted price, which fueled price fluctuations. Hao Xinbo, the manager of Changshengong, seeing that the cigarette and alcohol business could not obtain more profits, planned to declare bankruptcy and switch to the cotton business in September of this year. After investigation, the Industry and Commerce Bureau knew that his request to change industries was speculative and did not approve it. Hao Xinbo then arbitrarily transferred 13 million yuan of capital to Guoshu Cotton Mill to purchase a large amount of cotton for hoarding and speculation.
    The Fushun Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a symposium on December 1st, gathering representatives from various industry trade associations to discuss this issue. At the meeting, representatives from various industries unanimously demanded that the government severely punish these illegal merchants. The Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau accepted the demands of the representatives and filed a lawsuit with the People's Court in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Suppression of Illegal Acts of Industry and Commerce in the Northeast Region."

    抚顺少数奸商违反物价政策市工商局已向法院提起控诉
    编辑同志：抚顺市绝大多数工商业者，都能彻底执行爱国公约，改善经营方法，作到薄利多销，彻底执行国家的物价政策。但长盛公、福顺东、天兴福、吉丰源、庆记弹棉工业等二十多家私营工商业，则有严重地违反物价政策的行为。他们之中，有的哄抬物价，有的蒙混欺诈，有的违反营业规定，以达其谋取暴利的目的。如庆记弹棉工业，有资金二千一百多万元，过去曾因抬高物价被工商局处分过，而这次政府调整物价后，又把每斤一万零五百元的棉花，抬高到一万四千元出卖。布商杜长山在十一月一日政府调整物价后，仍没有按调整后的价格卖布。他是本行业的小组长，在他的影响下，同业各商贩也都没有按调整后的价格出售，因而助长了物价波动。长盛公经理郝心波因见烟酒业不能获得更多利润，在今年九月间，打算申报废业，改营棉花业。工商局经过调查，知道他要求转业，是投机性质，没有批准。郝心波竟擅自把资金一部一千三百万元转投国树制棉厂，购买大批棉花囤积居奇。
    抚顺市工商联合会在十二月一日召集全市各行同业公会代表开座谈会，讨论这一问题。会上各业代表一致要求政府对这些不法商人严加惩处。市工商局接受代表们的要求，根据“东北区工商业非法行为取缔暂行办法”，向人民法院提起控诉。
