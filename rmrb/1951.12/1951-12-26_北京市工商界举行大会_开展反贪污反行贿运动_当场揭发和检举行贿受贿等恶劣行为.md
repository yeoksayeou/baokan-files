Xinhua News Agency, December 25th—The industrial and commercial circles of Beijing held a meeting on the 25th to respond to the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The meeting was hosted by the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, with over 1,200 representatives from various industries in attendance. Cui Yueli, Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Peng Cheng, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and Yin Yukun, Deputy Governor of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, were invited to attend the meeting.

At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Fu Huating (Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce) delivered a mobilization report. He said: "Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing have made great progress through continuous learning and participation in various patriotic movements. However, some lawless merchants, inheriting the bad habits of the old society, have resorted to various means to bribe and entice personnel of government organizations in order to achieve the despicable goals of harming public interests for personal gain and reaping exorbitant profits." He also said: "If this phenomenon is allowed to develop, it will not only seriously damage the interests of the country and the people, but also seriously affect the development of legitimate industry and commerce." After listing various acts of bribery, he called on the entire industrial and commercial circles of Beijing to mobilize actively to make confessions and reports, and to strive to completely eliminate corruption, bribery, and other egregious phenomena.

Liu Shaochen, Director of the Timber Industry Guild, Liu Wenjing, Director of the Hardware Industry Guild, Yu Jingsheng, Director of the First District Office of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wang Minsheng, Director of the Western Medicine Industry Guild, and Liu Yuanjing, Director of the Construction Industry Guild, spoke successively, unanimously supporting the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and listing many facts in their respective industries to illustrate the necessity of launching the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement in the industrial and commercial circles. Liu Yuanjing, Director of the Construction Industry Guild, said: "Recently, a case has involved four of our construction companies, which is something to be wary of." He said that in the old society, collusion and bribery were rampant in the construction industry, and bidding became bribery. After liberation, some construction operators still have this bad style, which not only affects national construction, but also hinders the normal development of the construction industry. Therefore, he actively called on the construction industry to confess on their own initiative, and hoped that relevant industries would help them expose and report all egregious acts of bribery and acceptance of bribes.

Then, with warm applause, the meeting welcomed Zheng Yifu, Deputy Manager of Yongxing Construction Company, to confess his bribery, and Liu Songming, an accountant at Datong Electrical Appliance Store, to report the bribery of Su Zhiguo, the manager of the store, and the acceptance of bribes by a cadre of a certain government organization. Zheng Yifu said that he was willing to take advantage of this opportunity for self-renewal to report the serious mistakes he had committed to everyone. Since his construction company undertook the project of a dormitory for a certain government organization in October last year, he had bribed Wang Piye, the staff member in charge of the project, with more than 65 million yuan in the form of "deductions" by August this year. He also bribed the father of the section chief of the management section of a certain department in Changxindian with more than one million yuan in the form of "travel expenses." Liu Songming, an accountant at Datong Electrical Appliance Store, reported the illegal behavior of Su Zhiguo, the manager of the store, saying: He has a total of two or three sets of false accounts, and colludes with individual personnel from two government organizations, using false quotations to obtain exorbitant profits. This despicable and filthy behavior seriously harms the interests of the country and the people.

At the meeting, Cui Yueli, Peng Cheng, Yin Yukun, and others were invited to speak. In their speeches, they emphasized the significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, explained the government's policies, and expressed warm welcome and active support for the large-scale mobilization of the masses in the industrial and commercial circles to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign.

    北京市工商界举行大会
    开展反贪污反行贿运动
    当场揭发和检举行贿受贿等恶劣行为 【新华社二十五日讯】北京市工商界二十五日举行大会，响应反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动。大会由北京市工商业联合会主持，到会有各行业代表一千二百多人。中共北京市委员会统一战线工作部副部长崔月犁，北京市人民政府工商局局长彭城、人民银行北京分行副行长殷玉昆应邀参加大会。
    大会开始，首先由主席傅华亭（北京市工商业联合会主任委员）作动员报告，他说：“解放以来，北京工商界在中国共产党和人民政府正确的领导下，经过不断的学习和参加各项爱国运动，已经有了很大的进步。但是还有部分不法商人，承袭着旧社会的恶习，不惜用种种手段向机关工作人员进行行贿和引诱，以达到损公利己、坐获暴利的卑鄙目的。”他又说：“这种现象如果任其发展下去，不但严重地损害国家和人民的利益，同时也严重地影响正当工商业的发展。”他在列举了各种行贿的行为后，即号召北京市工商界全体动员起来，积极展开坦白和检举，为彻底扫除贪污、行贿等恶劣现象而努力。
    木业行业公会主任委员刘绍臣、五金业行业公会主任委员刘文经、工商联第一区办事处主任委员俞京生、西药业行业公会主任委员王敏生、营造业行业公会主任委员刘元敬等相继讲话，一致拥护开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，并列举本行业许多事实，说明在工商界中展开反贪污反行贿运动的必要性。营造业行业公会主任委员刘元敬说：“最近有一个案子就牵连我们四家营造厂，这是值得警惕的事。”他说：在旧社会，营造业勾结纳贿成风，竞标成为竞贿。解放后有些营造业者还有这种坏作风，不仅影响国家建设，也妨碍营造业的正常发展。因此，他积极号召营造业自行坦白，并希望有关行业帮助他们揭发和检举一切行贿受贿等恶劣行为。
    接着大会以热烈的掌声，欢迎永兴营造厂副经理郑一夫坦白他的行贿行为和大通电料行会计刘松明检举该行经理苏治国行贿与某机关干部的受贿行为。郑一夫说，他愿趁着这个自新的机会，坦白地把自己所犯的严重错误报告给大家。他的营造厂自去年十月承做某机关宿舍的工程，到今年八月，先后以“扣款”的形式向主持该工程的工作人员王丕业行贿六千五百多万元。他又以“路费”的形式向长辛店某部管理科长的父亲行贿一百多万元。大通电料行会计刘松明检举该行经理苏治国的不法行为说：他总共有两三本假账，并和某两个机关的个别人员进行勾结，以假估价单来获取暴利，这种卑鄙龌龊的行为，严重地损害国家和人民利益。
    会上，崔月犁、彭城、殷玉昆等都应邀讲话。他们在讲话中，着重地说明了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义，解释了政府的政策，并对工商界大张旗鼓地发动群众开展反贪污、反行贿的行动表示热烈的欢迎与积极的支持。
