(Reported by this newspaper) Following the expanded joint meeting of the Beijing Municipal Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee on December 1st, which discussed launching a city-wide anti-corruption and waste campaign, this newspaper has successively received reports from Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing on the launch of anti-corruption and waste campaigns.

The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Committee held its eighth plenary session (enlarged) on December 6th, mainly to discuss streamlining, economizing, and launching an anti-corruption campaign throughout the city. In the municipal government departments, after discussions, deliberations, and study, inspection teams were organized to focus on checking the financial situation of some government units and several warehouses. This movement is now gradually developing from a preliminary mobilization of the masses to expose various corruption and waste phenomena and bureaucratic styles of work, to a democratic inspection movement with leadership.

At the opening of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Representatives Conference (Third Session) yesterday (December 10th), Mayor Chen Yi specifically emphasized the need to vigorously launch a campaign to severely punish corruption and oppose waste while vigorously promoting the patriotic production increase and savings movement. He pointed out that it is essential to mobilize the masses to vigorously punish corruption and oppose waste. He said: "We are determined to mobilize the masses to thoroughly conduct the anti-corruption movement by means of democratic exposure, and ensure that corrupt elements are punished by law and not allowed to go scot-free. We must guarantee that corruption cannot exist in the people's government system. As for waste, although it is different from corruption in nature, it consumes the wealth of the country and the people, hinders the country's construction, and creates a wasteful and extravagant atmosphere, which directly or indirectly encourages corruption and degeneration. Therefore, opposing waste must be carried out simultaneously with severely punishing corruption." Mayor Chen Yi called on government personnel at all levels in Shanghai and the broad masses of citizens to immediately draw a clear line with corrupt elements while carrying out the movement to increase production and economize and oppose waste, and to immediately launch a fierce attack, never stopping until corruption is completely eliminated.

Vice Mayor Pan Hannian also requested in his report to the conference that the people of the city take action, respond to Mayor Chen's call, and resolutely fight against corruption and waste. He particularly pointed out that the judicial departments must expedite the handling of corruption cases of all sizes that have been discovered, and severely punish those with serious circumstances. Typical examples should be used for publicity and education to enlighten the people's awareness and resolutely fight against corruption. Vice Mayor Pan also asked the representatives attending the meeting to extensively contact the masses and encourage them to report and expose any corruption by staff members in the People's Government and state-owned enterprises and factories. At present, a mass anti-corruption movement is being launched throughout Shanghai.

    Tianjin to Hold City-Wide Mobilization Meeting for Government Cadres
    To Launch Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign

Tianjin Municipality will soon hold a city-wide mobilization meeting for government cadres to launch a city-wide anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. The Tianjin Municipal Taxation Bureau held an anti-corruption and anti-waste mobilization meeting on the 2nd of this month. The Tianjin Municipal People's Supervision Committee has also convened a meeting of supervisory correspondents, calling on them to participate in the fight against corruption and waste. In Tianjin's state organs and state-owned economic departments, many instances of corruption and waste have been discovered in the past. According to statistics from 400 cases already concluded by the Municipal People's Court, the loss of state wealth amounted to 1.1666 billion yuan, and the loss of people's assets amounted to 439 million yuan. Major corruption often occurs in financial departments. Corruption is more common among personnel below the level of public security sub-bureaus. Some corrupt elements take advantage of their power to take bribes and bend the law, collude with private merchants, sell market information, and evade taxes; others steal and sell public materials; some extort and blackmail; some revise accounts to underreport and overreport; and some engage in speculative business and collective corruption. In addition, waste is also significant due to leadership errors. For example, according to statistics from seven units including state-owned cotton textile factories and clothing factories, the accumulation of funds and materials reached 383 billion yuan. The North China Petroleum Company suffered a loss of 40 billion yuan due to being deceived. The extravagance and waste in some government departments is also serious. The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China spent 20 million yuan on entertainment expenses from January to October this year. The emergence and growth of this serious corruption and waste is mainly due to the bureaucratic style of work in the leadership. These problems will be addressed in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign.

    Wuhan Many Factory and Enterprise Workers and Masses
    Respond to the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, Production Increase and Savings Movement

Wuhan City is now actively carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, production increase and savings movement. After Chairman Mao issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy, the workers and masses of many factories and enterprises in Wuhan City actively responded. Many government departments have also launched mass democratic inspection movements against corruption and waste and against suppressing criticism. This movement has increased the political enthusiasm of the masses and exposed many serious corruption incidents, such as the Cui Mingqing incident in the Wuhan Municipal Department Store. On November 29th, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government and the Consultative Committee convened an expanded meeting including more than 1,000 representatives from all strata and all aspects. At this meeting, Mayor Wu Defeng used concrete facts to point out that corruption and waste must be overcome firmly and quickly. The Wuhan Municipal Production Increase and Savings Committee was established on the same afternoon, with Mayor Wu concurrently serving as the director. The Production Increase and Savings Committee called on all units in the city to convey the report on increasing production and practicing economy within the period from the 6th to the 15th of this month, and to mobilize all forces to closely combine democratic reform and democratic inspection to launch propaganda for increasing production and practicing economy. At the same time, it requires all units to formulate specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy after discussion before the 20th. The ongoing Fourth Wuhan Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China focuses on discussing how to make increasing production and practicing economy a regular and sustained mass movement throughout the city; at the same time, it is determined that anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy will be the main content of the rectification campaign for party member cadres in the city this winter and next spring.

    Guangzhou Determines Steps to Carry Out the Production Increase and Savings Movement
    First Mobilize the Masses to Expose Corruption and Waste

The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government convened a mobilization meeting for party member cadres and government cadres throughout the city on November 25th and 26th respectively, regarding the production increase and savings movement. City-wide and unit-level production increase and savings committees were subsequently established to carry out the city-wide production increase and savings movement. The steps are to first make a mobilization report, convey it in each unit, organize cadres to study documents, establish a correct understanding of increasing production and practicing economy, and then conduct mass democratic inspections from the inside to the outside, from top to bottom, from public to private, from enterprise departments to other departments, to expose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Each unit will then formulate a plan for increasing production and practicing economy separately. During the study, it was found that some cadres did not fully recognize the positive significance of the production increase and savings movement. Some people viewed it from a negative perspective, thinking that increasing production and practicing economy was about tightening belts; some people thought that increasing production and practicing economy was the business of the production department, or the general affairs section in government departments, and were indifferent; some people had complacent sentiments, thinking that their units had always complied with the system and that there was no "big profit" to be made from economizing; some units only looked at saving from small matters, but neglected major projects; a few people even thought that "corruption is a crime, but waste is not guilty," and some cadres were afraid of punishment and being transferred to other jobs. After studying, most cadres have initially cleared their minds. In the preliminary inspection, some instances of corruption and waste have been discovered. For example, the Guangzhou Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company neglected to protect state assets, resulting in the deterioration of medicines and a loss of more than 1.9 billion yuan. The Guangzhou Municipal Grain Branch wasted 200 million yuan in transportation costs per month for transporting grain into warehouses. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions inspected various grassroots trade unions and found 24 cases of corruption from April to November this year, including embezzlement of funds donated for airplanes and artillery. Many units have now initially formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the city's trade units plan to save more than 4.91 billion yuan in December this year. The preliminary plan for the city's financial and economic units' increase in production and savings next year is more than 189.7 billion yuan. Other factories and enterprises have made further achievements in the movement to increase production and practice economy. The Municipal Production Increase and Savings Committee decided that each unit should first submit the figures for next year's production increase and savings plan before the 15th of this month, and then collect and formulate the city-wide figures. Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy will be checked by each unit first, and then the superiors will focus on key areas for inspection, and each unit will also conduct mutual inspections. The movement is now gradually unfolding, but has not yet formed a mass movement.

    Xi'an is Conveying Comrade Xi Zhongxun's Report
    And Decided to Establish a City-Wide Production Increase and Savings Committee

The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in Xi'an City is about to be launched on a large scale. These days, all government departments in Xi'an are conveying Comrade Xi Zhongxun's report on "Continuing to Oppose Bureaucracy, Oppose Corruption, Oppose Waste, and Struggle for the Development of the Production Increase and Savings Movement." Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, also made a report on the transmission of the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the cadre conference of the first-level organs of the Northwest Administrative Region, mobilizing all cadres to invest in the movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption and waste, and oppose bureaucracy. Xi'an City decided to establish a production increase and savings committee on the 11th to lead the development of this movement.

    Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government
    Lead the City to Carry Out the Production Increase and Savings Movement

The movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption and waste, and oppose bureaucracy in Chongqing City has begun. On November 24th, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a city-wide cadre conference, at which Comrade Cao Diqiu, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, made a mobilization report. He pointed out the existing corruption and waste phenomena in various units in Chongqing City. Based on Chongqing's situation, he proposed several ways to increase production and practice economy, pointing out that in order to implement the movement to increase production and practice economy, the leading organs should take the lead, fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose corruption and waste phenomena, formulate specific savings plans, and implement regular inspections. On November 27th, cadres from party and government organs in Chongqing City gathered to decide to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, link it to ideological transformation, promote democracy, and widely carry out inspections. The Chongqing Municipal Production Increase and Savings Committee was established on December 5th in order to lead the development of this movement in a planned way. The production increase and savings committees of various government departments and units are also being established.

    上海、天津、武汉等六个城市
    反贪污浪费运动逐渐展开
    上海市陈毅市长号召彻底消灭贪污现象
    【本报讯】继北京市于本月一日举行市协商委员会和市人民政府委员会扩大联席会议，讨论开展全市规模反贪污浪费运动之后，本报又陆续收到上海、天津、武汉、广州、西安、重庆等地开展反贪污浪费运动的报道。
    上海市人民政府委员会于十二月六日举行第八次全体委员会议扩大会，主要讨论精简节约及在全市展开反贪污运动的问题。在市属各机关中，经过讨论酝酿与学习，组织检查小组，有重点地检查了一些机关单位财务情况及若干仓库等。这一运动现正由初步发动群众，检举揭发各种贪污浪费现象和官僚主义作风，逐渐发展成为有领导的民主检查运动。
    上海市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议于昨天（十日）开幕时，陈毅市长在开会辞中特别强调提出必须在大力展开爱国增产节约运动的同时，发动严惩贪污与反浪费的运动。他指出一定要发动群众大张旗鼓地严惩贪污与反对浪费。他说：“我们下定决心要动员群众以民主检举的方法彻底进行反贪污运动，务必使贪污分子受到法律的惩戒，不让他逍遥法外，要保证使贪污现象不能在人民政府系统中存在。至于浪费在性质上虽与贪污不同，但它耗费国家人民的财物，障碍国家的建设，造成铺张奢侈的风气，直接间接地助长了贪污腐化，故反对浪费必须与严惩贪污同时进行。”陈毅市长号召上海市各级政府人员及广大市民在开展节约增产反对浪费运动时，立即与贪污分子划清界限，立即发动猛攻，非作到彻底消灭贪污罪行决不休止。
    潘汉年副市长也在会议的报告中，要求全市人民行动起来，响应陈市长的号召，与贪污浪费现象坚决地斗争。他特别指出司法部门对已查出的大小贪污案件，一定要加紧处理，情况严重者必须严办。并拿其中典型的例子进行宣传教育，以启发人民的觉悟，对贪污行为进行坚决的斗争。潘副市长并要求与会代表广泛联系群众，鼓励群众对人民政府中和公营企业工厂中的工作人员有贪污行为者加以检举揭发。现在，群众性的反贪污运动正在上海全市展开中。
    天津将开全市机关干部动员大会
    开展反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动
    天津市最近将召开全市机关干部动员大会，开展全市规模的反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动。天津市税务局已在本月二日举行反贪污反浪费动员大会。天津市人民监察委员会也已召开过监察通讯员大会，号召监察通讯员参加反贪污反浪费的斗争。在天津市国家机关及国营经济部门中，过去已经发现不少贪污浪费现象。据市人民法院已经结案的四百起案件的统计，国家财富损失十一亿六千六百余万元，群众资产损失四亿三千九百余万元。贪污较大的多在财经部门。贪污行为较普遍的是公安分局以下的人员。贪污分子有的利用职权贪赃卖法，与私商勾结，出卖行情，偷漏税款；有的盗卖公家物资；有的敲榨勒索；有的修改账目，以少报多；有的搞投机商业，集体贪污。此外，由于领导上的过失，浪费也很大。如据国营棉纺织厂、被服厂等七个单位的统计，积压资金和材料即达三千八百三十亿元。华北石油公司因被骗，损失四百亿元。某些机关的铺张浪费现象也是严重的。人民银行天津分行今年一月至十月招待费就支出了两千万元。这种严重贪污浪费现象的产生及滋长，主要是由于领导上有官僚主义作风所致。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，这些问题都将加以解决。武汉很多工厂企业的职工群众
    响应反贪污浪费增产节约运动
    武汉市现正积极开展反贪污浪费、增产节约运动。毛主席发出增产节约的号召后，武汉市很多工厂企业的职工群众，都积极起来响应。很多机关也开展了反对贪污浪费、反对压制批评的群众性的民主检查运动。这个运动提高了群众的政治积极性，揭发了很多的严重的贪污事件，如武汉市百货公司崔明清事件等。十一月二十九日，武汉市人民政府和协商委员会召开包括各阶层各方面代表千余人的扩大会议，在这个会上，吴德峰市长用具体事实指出：必须坚决、迅速地克服贪污浪费现象。武汉市增产节约委员会于同日下午成立，由吴市长兼主任委员。增产节约委员会号召全市各单位在本月六日至十五日内，传达增产节约报告，并动员各种力量，密切结合民主改革、民主检查，展开增产节约宣传。同时要求各单位在二十日以前经过讨论，订出增产节约的具体计划。正在进行中的中共武汉市第四次党员代表大会，着重讨论了如何使增产节约成为全市经常、持久的群众性运动；同时确定以反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义为今冬明春全市党员干部整风的主要内容。
    广州确定开展增产节约运动步骤
    首先动员群众揭发贪污浪费现象
    中共广州市委和广州市人民政府在十一月二十五、二十六两日，分别召开了全市党员干部和机关干部关于增产节约运动的动员大会。全市性的和各单位的增产节约委员会随即分别成立，开展全市增产节约运动。步骤是首先作动员报告，在各单位进行传达，组织干部学习文件，树立对增产节约的正确的认识，然后由内到外，由上到下，由公到私，由企业部门到其他部门，进行群众性的民主检查，揭露贪污浪费和官僚主义现象。并由各单位分别订出增产节约计划。在学习中，发现某些干部对增产节约运动的积极意义认识不足，有些人是从消极方面看，以为增产节约是节衣缩食；有些人又以为增产节约是生产部门的事，或是机关中总务科的事，而漠不关心；有些人有自满情绪，以为本单位一向遵守制度，节约也没有“大油水”；有些单位只从小事上来看节约，却忽视了大的项目；个别人甚至以为“贪污犯法，浪费无罪”，有些干部则怕处分、怕调动工作。经过学习，一般干部已经初步打通了思想。在初步检查中，已发现一些贪污浪费现象。如中国工业器材公司广州分公司忽视保护国家资财，霉坏药品损失十九亿余元。广州市粮食分公司运粮入仓每月浪费运费两亿元。市总工会检查各基层工会，从今年四月到十一月，发现贪污事件二十四起，其中包括有贪污捐献飞机大炮款项的。许多单位现在已经初步订出增产节约计划。如市贸易单位计划今年十二月份节约四十九亿一千多万元。市财经单位的明年增产节约数字，初步计划为一千八百九十七亿余元。其他工厂企业在增产节约运动中，已有进一步的成绩。市增产节约委员会决定，先由各单位在本月十五日以前提出明年的增产节约计划数字，再汇集拟定全市数字。贪污浪费与官僚主义现象，则先由各单位自行检查，然后再由上级抓住重点进行检查，各单位并进行相互检查。现在运动正在逐步展开，但还未形成群众运动。
    西安市正传达习仲勋同志的报告
    并决定成立全市增产节约委员会
    西安市反对贪污浪费和官僚主义的运动即将大规模展开。这几天，西安市各机关正传达习仲勋同志关于“继续反对官僚主义、反对贪污、反对浪费、为开展增产节约运动而斗争”的报告。西北区军政委员会副主席张治中在西北大行政区一级机关干部大会上又作了关于人民政协全国委员会第三次会议的传达报告，动员全体干部投入增产节约、反对贪污浪费和反官僚主义的运动中来。西安市决定在十一日成立增产节约委员会，以领导这一运动的开展。
    中共重庆市委和市人民政府
    领导全市开展增产节约运动
    重庆市增产节约、反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动已经开始。十一月二十四日，中共重庆市委员会召开全市党员干部大会，由市委第二书记曹荻秋同志作动员报告。他指出了重庆市各单位已有的贪污浪费现象。并根据重庆市情况提出了增产节约的几项办法，指出为贯彻增产节约运动，首先应由领导机关做起，充分发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评，揭发贪污浪费现象，订出具体的节约计划，并实行定期检查。十一月二十七日，重庆市党政机关干部集会，决开展增产节约运动，联系思想改造，发扬民主，广泛展开检查。重庆市增产节约委员会已在十二月五日成立，以便有计划地领导这一运动的开展。各机关单位的增产节约委员会也正在成立。
