    The Making of the First "Resist America, Aid Korea" Documentary
    Xu Xiaobing
    Editor's Note: The first "Resist America, Aid Korea" documentary, produced by the Beijing Film Studio, will be simultaneously screened in 265 theaters across 40 cities nationwide on the 28th of this month. This is a large-scale documentary reflecting the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front and the various activities of the people across the country in the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The author of this article, Comrade Xu Xiaobing, is a Stalin Prize winner, the captain of the Beijing Film Studio's Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea film crew, and the director of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" documentary discussed in this article. In this article, he introduces the work of the film crew on the Korean front and the production process of the film.

    The young Chinese people's news film industry has grown under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

    China's news documentary film is the vanguard on the literary and artistic front. Our news photographers have filmed documentary films such as "The Northeast Liberation Campaign," "Red Flags Sweep the West Wind," "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "The Great Battle of Hainan Island," and "The Army Marching into Tibet" during the War of Liberation. To capture these films, our excellent brother photographers - Comrades Wang Jing'an, Zhang Shaoke, Yang Yinxuan, and Guan Zhijian heroically sacrificed their lives.

    The Resist America, Aid Korea movement is another great heroic undertaking in the history of the Chinese people after the People's Liberation War. Our filmmakers regard the work of reflecting this great theme as our glorious task. Our news photographers resolutely responded to the call of the motherland and actively participated in this just struggle. When we encountered the arrogant provocations of the American imperialist air bandits on the border of our motherland, we recorded the enemy's criminal bombing, this act of aggression and blood debt, in the film and in our hearts, which made us even more courageous in following the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Korean battlefield.

    We have more than a dozen teams working on the front lines. For such a theme with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, for such a great theme, we first realized how to boldly and truthfully record the objective facts. Our photographers not only realized their glorious responsibility in their profession but also realized their political role. Every time we went to a company, we added new content to the company's combat mobilization and enhanced the soldiers' combat courage. As long as we appeared on the position, we could hear the soldiers say: "Comrades, let's fight a beautiful victory and let the photography comrades film us capturing American devils alive. That's the glory of the motherland!"

    "Comrades, let's fiercely eliminate the American imperialist invaders. We're going to be in the movie, so let the people of the motherland see our skills. Chairman Mao will definitely see us too."

    Because of the heroic fighting of our soldiers, the materials we captured were particularly moving.

    Our photographers are not only literary and artistic workers on the battlefield, not only propaganda workers in combat, but also staunch soldiers ready to fight the enemy to the death at any time. Liu Deyuan, Su Zhongyi, and Sun Shuxiang, comrades of our photography team, fought an encounter with three American devils on the battlefield. After a fierce battle, the three American devils laid down their weapons and knelt before our photographers.

    Zhang Fengwu, a comrade from our photography team, encountered frantic bombing by enemy planes in a certain place. Bombs and incendiary bombs burned everything on the ground. He saw that the air-raid shelter where his camera and film were stored was also burning. He rushed into the thick smoke and flames to rescue the camera and film, his hair and cotton clothes were burned. He immediately lay down on the snow to extinguish the fire on his body, got up, and picked up the camera again to record the disaster that the American imperialist robbers brought to the Korean people.

    We spent a severe winter in North Korea, with temperatures often between minus thirty and forty degrees Celsius. At that time, each of our photographers had a burden of more than twenty kilograms. In order not to let the enemy discover our actions, we had to act at night. During the march, we often followed the advanced troops, and we often waded through those rivers that were about to freeze, and climbed those deserted mountains and ridges, and camped in the wilderness where the wind and snow were biting. We were with the heroic Volunteer Army comrades of the motherland and never felt any hardship.

    On the Korean front, we captured nearly 20,000 meters of film material in such a tense and dangerous way. These films are permeated with the enthusiasm, blood, and lives of our comrades. Our good comrade Yang Xuzhong encountered bombing and strafing by American invaders on the Korean battlefield and finally shed his last drop of blood. Two assistant comrades were also injured on the front line. These losses made us feel sad and proud at the same time.

    The first "Resist America, Aid Korea" film has been completed after several months of editing and under the continuous guidance and help of the higher authorities. But we, the workers, do not feel relaxed. What makes us most uneasy is that this film is still quite disproportionate to the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea cause.

    If this film has made even a very small contribution to the great cause of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country, then it should be attributed to the people who created this cause, that is, the people who created this film - the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army of our motherland.

    文献纪录片“抗美援朝”第一部摄制经过
    徐肖冰
    编者按：北京电影制片厂摄制的“抗美援朝”文献纪录片第一部，将于本月二十八日在全国四十个城市二百六十五个影院同时放演。这是一部反映人民志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇作战和全国人民在伟大的抗美援朝运动中的各方面活动的大型纪录片。本文作者徐肖冰同志是斯大林奖金获得者、北京电影制片厂志愿抗美援朝随军摄影队队长，并且是本文所写的“抗美援朝”文献纪录片第一部的编导。他在本文中介绍了随军摄影队在朝鲜前线工作的情形和本片的摄制经过。
    年青的中国人民的新闻电影事业，是在毛泽东文艺思想指导之下成长起来的。
    中国人民的新闻纪录电影，是文艺战线上的先锋队。我们的新闻摄影师们，曾经在祖国解放战争中，摄下了“东北解放战役”、“红旗漫卷西风”、“百万雄师下江南”、“大战海南岛”、“解放西藏大军行”等文献纪录影片。为了摄取这些影片，我们优秀的兄弟摄影师——王静安、张绍柯、杨荫宣和关志俭同志英勇地牺牲了生命。
    抗美援朝运动是继人民解放战争之后中国人民历史上又一个最伟大的英雄事业。我们电影工作者，把反映这个伟大题材的工作，当作自己光荣的任务。我们的新闻摄影师们，坚决响应了祖国的召唤，积极地参加了这个正义的斗争。当我们在祖国的边境，遭遇了美帝国主义空中强盗狂妄的挑衅，我们就把敌人的罪恶的滥炸，把这笔侵略的暴行和血债记在影片上，也记在我们的心里，使我们更加奋勇地随着祖国人民志愿军走上了朝鲜战场。
    我们有十几个队一直在战地工作着，我们对于这样一个具有高度爱国主义和国际主义的主题，对于这样一个伟大的主题，首先是意识到要怎样大胆地真实地把客观的事迹纪录下来。我们的摄影师，不仅意识到自己业务上的光荣责任，而且更意识到自己在政治上的作用。我们每到一个连队，就增加了这个连队战斗动员的新内容，提高了战士们的战斗勇气，只要我们出现在阵地上，那么就能听到战士们这样地说：“同志们，要打个漂漂亮亮的胜利仗，让摄影同志把咱们活捉美国鬼子照上电影，那是祖国的光荣啊！”
    “同志们，要狠狠消灭美帝国主义侵略者，要上电影啦，让祖国人民看看咱们的本领。毛主席也一定会看见咱们的。”
    由于我们战士们的英勇战斗，也就使我们摄取的材料格外动人。
    我们的摄影师不仅是战场上的文艺工作者，不仅是战斗中的鼓动工作者，我们也是随时准备和敌人作生死搏斗的顽强的战士。我们摄影队的刘德源、苏忠义和孙树相同志，在战场上和三个美国鬼子打了一场遭遇战，经过激烈的战斗，三个美国鬼子都放下了武器跪在我们摄影师的面前。
    我们摄影队的张凤悟同志在某地遭遇了敌机狂炸，炸弹和烧夷弹把地面的一切都烧着了。他看到他放着摄影机和胶片的防空洞，也在燃烧着，就奋不顾身地闯进浓烟烈火把电影机和胶片抢救出来，自己的头发和棉衣都烧着了。他马上躺在雪地里滚熄了身上的火，爬起来又拿起摄影机纪录了美帝国主义强盗带给朝鲜人民的毁灭的灾难。
    我们在北朝鲜度过了严寒的冬季，气温经常在零下三十度——四十度之间。那时候，我们每个摄影队员，都有二十多公斤的负担。为了不让敌人发觉我们的行动，只好在夜间行动。在行军中我们经常跟着前哨部队，我们经常涉过那些将要结冰的江河，攀越那些人烟绝迹的丛山峻岭，就在那些风雪刺骨的野外露营。我们和祖国的英雄的志愿军同志们在一起，从来没感到有什么艰难。
    在朝鲜前线，我们就是这样紧张和艰险地摄取了将近二万公尺影片的素材，就在这些影片里，渗透着我们同志的热情，鲜血和生命。我们的好战友——杨序忠同志就在朝鲜战场上遭遇了美国侵略者的轰炸与扫射，终于流尽了最后的一滴血。有两个助手同志也在前线负了伤。这些损失使我们感到沉痛，同时也感到自豪。 “抗美援朝”第一部影片，经过几个月的编辑，在上级不断指导帮助下，目前终于完成了。但是我们工作者本人并不感到轻松，使我们最不安的就是这部影片和这样轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝事业，仍旧是颇不相称的。
    如果这部影片在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大事业中，有一些那怕极微小的贡献，那么应该归功于创造这个事业的人，也就是创造这部影片的人——我们祖国英雄的人民志愿军。（附图片）
