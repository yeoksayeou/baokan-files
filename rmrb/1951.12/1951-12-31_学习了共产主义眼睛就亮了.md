    Studying Communism Has Brightened Our Eyes
    Editor: After studying the theories of communism and the Communist Party, the party member cadres of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee's Party Rectification Training Team have generally taken a step forward in their ideological level. Before the study, many people had developed a "retreating slope" mentality. For example, Wang Wu said, "Before studying, I always thought revolution was about suffering." "Communism sounds good when talked about, but who knows when it will be realized?" "The Japanese have been driven away, Chiang Kai-shek has been kicked out, and we have houses and land, so what's left to 'revolve'!" They also educated their children in this way: "Don't go to school, just farm well. Being a 'labor hero' is much better than going to school." After studying the theories of communism and the Communist Party, everyone realized that they were too backward and resolved to study and work honestly in the future, and never be emotional again. They said, "Our eyes have been brightened (referring to understanding communist society), and we have more energy to work!"

    学习了共产主义眼睛就亮了
    编辑同志：中共河北省委整党训练队的党员干部，学习了共产主义和共产党的理论，大家的思想水平普遍地提高了一步。没有学习以前，不少人产生了“退坡”思想。如王五可说：“在学习前总以为革命是受苦。”“共产主义讲起来听起来都好，谁知道在什么时候才能实现。”“日本被打走了，蒋介石被赶跑了，有房又有地，还有什么好‘革’的！”他们还这样教育子女：“别上学了，好好种地，当个‘劳动英雄’比上学强得多。”学习了共产主义和共产党的理论后，大家都发现自己太落后了，决心在今后老老实实地学习、工作，再不闹情绪。他们说：“眼睛亮了（指了解共产主义社会），工作起来就有劲啦！”
