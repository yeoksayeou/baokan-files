    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives in East China Region Formulates a Plan
    Strive for Increased Production and Savings of 330 Billion Yuan Next Year
    Cooperatives in Beijing Strive to Save 650,000 Jin of Millet in Commodity Circulation Costs in the Fourth Quarter
    Xinhua News Agency: The All-China Federation of Cooperatives in East China Region, at the joint meeting of directors of cooperative federations of provinces, administrative regions, and cities in East China held in November, approved the plan for increased production and savings for 1952. The plan stipulates that cooperatives in the East China region as a whole should strive for increased production and savings of 331.559 billion yuan next year through reducing commodity circulation costs, increasing funds accumulated by grassroots cooperatives from savings, and increasing production in processing businesses of cooperatives above the county level. Among them, the commodity circulation cost rate will be reduced from 6.6 percent to 5.7 percent; the goal for increasing fund accumulation by grassroots cooperatives from savings is 2 percent of the total turnover; and the funds accumulated by cooperatives above the county level from increased production in commodity processing businesses will be 100 billion yuan. According to this plan, various departments of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in East China have separately determined their respective goals for increased production and savings. During the process of formulating the plan for increased production and savings, the leaders of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in East China focused on the trust management department of the federation, inspecting and sorting out various work systems of the department. The leaders of the federation first mobilized all staff members of the trust management department to conduct criticism and self-criticism, exposing 177 loss incidents that occurred in the department in the past year; mobilized everyone to study the causes of these incidents, and formulated work systems to ensure increased production and savings and avoid accidents. When formulating the system, they further implemented the spirit of streamlining and thrift, and formulated a plan for organizational structure and staffing to improve work efficiency. Finally, the department also carried out registration and statistics of materials in each section, clearing out a large number of usable materials, which provided a basis for preparing the budget later. The leaders of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in East China have now promoted the experience of the trust management department to various departments to ensure the completion of the task of increasing production and savings next year.
    The cooperatives in Beijing responded to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and savings and proposed to save 650,000 jin of millet in commodity circulation costs in the business of the fourth quarter of this year.
    In mid-November, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation convened responsible persons from district joint cooperatives in urban areas, branch cooperatives in suburban areas, independent consumer cooperatives, and directly affiliated production units to hold a mobilization meeting for increased production and savings. Wang Chun, director of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, made a mobilization report, pointing out that the current central content of increased production and savings for cooperatives in Beijing includes four items, the main link being to expand trade volume and reduce commodity circulation costs; the second is to improve working methods and improve work efficiency; oppose corruption and waste; and expand the retail network to relatively reduce administrative personnel.
    Regarding the specific figures for increased production and savings, the responsible persons of each unit, after discussion, believed that the trade volume in the fourth quarter of this year can be increased by 23 percent compared with the third quarter, and the commodity circulation cost can be reduced by 0.531 percent compared with the third quarter. In this way, 650,000 jin of millet can be saved in expenses. Each unit believes that among the items for reducing commodity circulation costs, the reduction of transportation costs should be the main focus, followed by the reduction of losses, capital interest, and water and electricity expenses.

    华东区合作总社订出计划
    争取明年增产节约三千三百多亿元
    北京市各合作社争取第四季度节约商品流转费六十五万斤小米
    华东区合作总社在十一月间召开的华东区各省、行署区、市合作总社主任联席会议上，通过了一九五二年的增产节约计划。计划规定：华东全区合作社明年度要从减低商品流转费用、增加基层合作社从节约方面积累的资金和县以上合作社在加工业务上增产等方面，增产节约三千三百一十五亿五千九百多万元。其中，商品流转费用率将从百分之六点六降低到百分之五点七；基层合作社从节约方面增加资金积累的目标为经营总额的百分之二；县以上合作社在商品加工业务上增产积累的资金为一千亿元。根据这个计划，华东合作总社各部门已分别确定了各自在增产节约方面的努力目标。在拟订增产节约计划过程中，华东合作总社领导方面曾把该社信托经理部作为重点，检查和整理了该部各项工作制度。该社领导方面首先发动信托经理部全体工作人员进行批评与自我批评，揭发了一年来该部发生的损失事故一百七十七件；发动大家研究发生这些事故的原因，订出保证增产节约、避免发生事故的工作制度。在订制度时，又进一步贯彻精简节约的精神，拟订了机构编制和人员配备的方案，以提高工作效率。最后，该部又进行了各课物资的登记、统计，清理出大批可用物资，使以后编造预算时有了依据。华东合作总社领导方面现在已把信托经理部的经验推广到各部门，以保证明年增产节约任务的完成。（新华社）
    北京市各合作社响应毛主席关于增产节约的号召，提出在今年第四季度业务中，节约商品流转费六十五万斤小米。
    十一月中旬，北京市供销合作总社召集城区各区联社、郊区各分社、各独力经营的消费社和直属生产单位的负责人员，举行增产节约动员大会。市供销合作总社王纯主任做了动员报告，他指出北京市各合作社目前增产节约的中心内容有四项，主要环节是扩大贸易额、减低商品流转费；其次是改进工作方法，提高工作效率；反对贪污浪费；扩大零售网，相对减少行政人员。
    关于增产节约的具体数字，各单位负责人员经过讨论以后，认为今年第四季度贸易额可以比第三季度增加百分之二十三，商品流转费能比第三季度降低百分之○·五三一。这样，就能节省六十五万斤小米的开支。各单位认为：在降低商品流转费用的项目中，应该以降低运输费为主，其次是降低损耗、资金利息和水电开支。（荫桐）
