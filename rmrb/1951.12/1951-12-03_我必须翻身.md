I Must Turn Over
Dong Weichuan
Professor, Department of Education, Beijing Normal University

The Wu Xun problem has decisively severed my reformist baggage, making me realize that I have consistently been serving reactionary rule by employing what I thought was progressive reformism. It also made me acknowledge that while I myself was not particularly reactionary in the past, my mind was harboring many reactionary thoughts. Recently, Premier Zhou's report has enabled me to further examine the various deeds of serving reactionary rule over the past thirty years, and I feel that I have developed from a hanger-on and helper to an accomplice, only turning to oppose reactionary rule due to the lessons learned from certain facts and the environment, but still using reformism to oppose it. I have gradually had these reflections, but I dare not say that I fully understand myself.

When I was studying in middle school and university, it was the era of warlord melee. I entered a normal university, and no one ever told me about the relationship between education and politics. I was willing to devote my life to the "noble" cause of education and detested "turbid" politics. I envied the professors who came and went with briefcases every day. To be a "professor" and have "academic" prestige was the highest ideal of my life. Therefore, during my university years, I only buried myself in reading and teaching (running night schools and teaching part-time in middle schools), and never participated in strikes, marches, or other events. Later, when I engaged in education, I simply focused my mind on education, believing that other things had nothing to do with me. I also had no interest in fellow-villager associations or alumni associations. I did not participate in any organizational activities, did not want to become an official or get rich, did not flatter anyone, relied on my own skills to make a living, and acted independently. I would stay if I agreed, and leave if I didn't. I considered myself an "isolationist" and was proud of it. I hated people who were obsequious to their superiors and arrogant to their inferiors. No matter where I worked, I never approached my "superiors" and even slammed the table at my "superiors" almost everywhere, even leaving in a huff.

Did I have a set of views on politics? No. The "May Fourth" Movement made me like to read books and newspapers introducing new ideas. I valued the theories of Huxley, Darwin, Kropotkin, and Marx. Due to the success of the Soviet revolution, I believed that Marx's theories would inevitably be promoted all over the world. Therefore, when I taught Chinese in middle school, I often introduced these ideas. At that time, a small number of young people learned about class struggle because of me and later embarked on the road of revolution. But for myself, I was only "talking about" knowledge, and it had nothing to do with action. When I was in Nankai, Tianjin, my colleague Mr. Fan Wenlan introduced me to a progressive organization and introduced me to the person in charge, but I feared the practice of revolutionary struggle and ran away.

I ran to Shanghai and saw the Blue Sky White Sun flag for the first time, thinking that Chiang Kai-shek had successfully led the revolution. Since then, I have been striving for the realization of the Three People's Principles, and believing that the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three People's Principles was almost the same as communism, I established a blind orthodox concept in my mind. I no longer paid attention to the activities of the Communist Party.

When I was the principal of a middle school in Jiangsu, I thought I had a new style, but the young people became estranged from me, even hostile. Because they were making trouble against the pseudo-Central University Administrative Yuan's (there was no education department at that time) handling of food expenses, I felt that the young people were not listening to me, and I left in a huff again. They were not making trouble against me in the first place. As a result, they put up slogans scolding me for "flattering the Central Government." After more than twenty years, I did not understand the reason why they were hostile to me until after liberation when I realized that I was already an "orthodox" at that time.

Later, I served as a supervisor in three provinces, going deep into various counties and rural areas, and learned about some problems, but I did not understand their essence. Once, the Shandong Education Department sent me to Qufu Normal School to investigate a case of "communization." I just played around and did things perfunctorily because I had a preliminary stage of thought as a foundation, which made me not oppose the Communist Party. In terms of my relationship with the reactionary rule, these few years of work can barely be said to be helping out, and then I began to help.

From the "September 18th" Incident to the "July 7th" Incident, I ran popular education in Shandong, thinking that popular education was a way to "save the country," following the "Rural Reconstruction Movement," and working hard to play a role in powdering reactionary rule. This stage was the beginning of serious help. But in my subjective view, I was still "above politics." I followed Mr. Cai Yuanpei's "inclusiveness," and in a popular education institution, there were all kinds of people from the Blue Shirts Society, the Third Party, the Reorganization Clique, and progressive youth. I only asked them to work hard in education, and did not care about other things. Did I have likes and dislikes? I looked down on the Blue Shirts Society, did not understand the Third Party and the Reorganization Clique, and liked young people who were moving to the left.

When Jinan was about to fall, a few friends, such as Yang Xiwen and Liang Zhuhang, wanted me to stay in Shandong to fight guerrillas. I did not have the courage and only fled. I fled to what the reactionaries called the rear, and thus embarked on the road of being an accomplice. At first, I was leading the popular education staff who had fled from various provinces for the pseudo-Ministry of Education, publicizing the war of resistance. The period was very short, and I didn't do anything. Later, it was different. I was invited to Guangxi to help Qiu Changwei design a set of "adult education years" to train people into slaves, but subjectively, I thought it was to intensify the education of the people to rise up and resist the war. Then, I saw that Chiang Kai-shek's personally ordered "unity of management, education, support, and defense" in the "New County System" and the "National Education Implementation Outline" were promulgated, and I actually thought that these were all helpful to the war of resistance. Therefore, I published articles one after another, praising them greatly. This was because, since I had fled with Chiang Kai-shek, and had recognized the corruption of the pseudo-regime from Chiang Kai-shek's gang's successive defeats, I had a "wish for iron to become steel" mentality. As soon as I saw a new trick, I would have hope and fantasy. And I was deceived by a fallacy, thinking that Chiang Kai-shek himself was good, but only his subordinates were bad; therefore, I always had good feelings towards him. I hated the trivial provisions of the "New Life Movement," but I felt that the "Youth Code" was proper. Therefore, when I was at the "Jiangsu Provincial Education College" in Guilin, I accompanied the rotation to explain the "Youth Code" to create slaves.

Later, the forces of revolution and counter-revolution gradually had a short-term confrontation in the school. What about me? I held a "supra-political" "middle attitude," and because I had a little sympathy for the Communist Party in my heart, I ridiculously crowned myself as "middle-left." But whenever the school expelled a large number of students, I attended the school affairs meeting as the chairman of the department or a representative of the professors. Seeing that this was bound to happen, although I was angry in my heart, I kept silent and only went home to complain. Sometimes I knew in advance that the pseudo-government was going to arrest students, so I would notify certain students to be careful or prepare to leave, and sometimes I would help them design their escape, but I never actively resisted. Even when I saw the blacklists taken out by the school authorities at the meeting were from the pseudo-Ministry of Education, I really thought that the school authorities were acting on orders and were helpless. After the meeting, I even deceived the students with this kind of talk.

The most profound impression was: Gao Yang, the reactionary president of Jiangsu Education College, expelled a large number of students on Lunar New Year's Eve and immediately drove them out of the school, leaving them with nowhere to live on the eve of New Year's Day. I was silent at that meeting.

After Jiangsu Education College closed down, President Gao Yang was promoted to the president of Guangxi University for his contribution to suppressing progressive forces. He pulled me to be his secretary. Although I was unwilling to engage in administration, I could not refuse. Following him, he used a large number of armed military police to "take over," and then arrested and expelled a number of students. I firmly resigned after a month of doing it, specializing in teaching. I had no part in his reactionary behavior; but it cannot be denied that it was, in fact, another record of me being an accomplice.

In Bishan, the special agent students of the pseudo-National Social Education College launched an anti-Soviet parade, and the slogans contained words threatening the faculty and staff to participate. Although I was also dissatisfied when I saw it, when a few teachers prepared to question Xu Gongjian, the director of training, and invited me to sign, I not only declined but also was willing to mediate this conflict for fear that the school would collapse. Isn't this a further accomplice!

When Chiang Kai-shek's gang's so-called "Youth Army" was established, I called it the "Imperial Guard" on the one hand, and wrote wall newspaper drafts for them to publicize on the other hand, and also helped to raise donations for consolation. The reason was that I did not dare to offend those special agent students.

When the movement to elect pseudo-legislators entered the school in Suzhou, I did not ask or care. But when the director of training came to my house to ask for my seal to elect on my behalf, I could not refuse.

On another occasion, the students went on strike and knocked on my door in the middle of the night, asking me to give them a lecture the next morning. How much hope they had for me! But I had no courage. Unable to refuse, I went on stage, facing the few special agents from the pseudo-"Suzhou Garrison Command" sitting in the front row, and gave a speech on "eliminating illiteracy" and finished. Thinking about it now, it's simply a slapstick farce!

Based on the above recollections, it is enough to show that although I recognized the truth, I did not dare to accept the truth and face the truth. In order to live a comfortable life and to climb up, I did not hesitate to fall into the arms of reactionary rule, developing from a hanger-on and helper to an accomplice, but still calling myself "noble" and "supra-political," and still thinking of myself as "historically clean" and holding a "middle attitude" after liberation. Sometimes I had a small contradiction in my heart, but in order to "protect myself wisely," cowardly thoughts suppressed my sense of justice, and I was timid for decades!

Recently, I talked to a friend about these things, and he said: "You have also fought!" This refers to the last part of my time in Suzhou, but it also makes me ashamed! Due to the lawlessness of the special agents, the wanton actions of the American imperialists in China, the uncontrollable inflation, and the repeated student movements... I was completely disappointed with Chiang Kai-shek and hated him to the bone. I successively published several articles in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao to cheer on the student movement, writing more and more furiously, no longer afraid of anything. As a result, starting from the Xinmin Daily in Nanjing, all the way to several newspapers in Shanghai, said that I was dismissed. I had no choice but to go north. When I arrived in this cultural capital where the student movement was surging, I openly gave lectures at Normal University and Fu Jen University against imperialism and feudal forces. I also analyzed these issues in class, and even gave a lecture to a group of primary and secondary school principals during the siege, asking "For whom do we educate?" As a result, I was awarded the title of "progressive professor," but everything I talked about was essentially based on my reformism and belief in the omnipotence of education. How ridiculous and laughable this kind of "battle" is! But in any case, I did have the courage to stand up at that time.

To settle the account, the reason why I called myself "not very reactionary" when reviewing the Wu Xun problem was because I had no relationship with any small organization of Chiang Kai-shek's gang. I refused Zhu Jiahua's appointment to be the president of Northwest Normal College, refused the invitation of Peiping Normal College to be the director of training, and refused the coercion of the special agents who wanted me to take a plane to escape to the south. I did not do these things, so I thought I was reactionary but not very reactionary. But after studying Premier Zhou's report and having a preliminary understanding of the boundaries of dividing the enemy from ourselves, the more I recalled my past, the more I felt that the degree of reaction was "very" enough!

From these recollections, the lesson I have learned is: I have been on the same stand as Chiang Kai-shek for more than twenty years from the Great Revolution to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The facts are very obvious. As for the "middle line," "supra-politics," "nobility," etc., everything is self-deceiving. In the case of increasingly sharp struggles between the two sides, despite having the feeling of "eating fish and disliking the smell," the fact is that I was eating fish every day and studying how to improve the way of making fish. Where can I find the "middle line"? Since it is impossible to have a "middle line," isn't it being a liar for decades by still calling myself "noble" and "supra-political"!

After liberation, although I subjectively demanded reform, because I was burdened with a "progressive" baggage, I failed to correctly understand myself and did not touch the essence of my thinking, and thus constantly made some mistakes. Singing the praises of Wu Xun is just one example of my significant mistake. In addition, I will give another major example to illustrate the distance between me and the people's position: Not long after the liberation of Beijing, the Military Control Commission sent me to be a member of the school affairs committee of Normal University and acting president of the Education College. The Education College of Normal University was a mess. Among the five departments, from the tasks and direction of the departments to personnel, curriculum, teaching materials, methods, and years, there were problems everywhere. I could not refuse, so I had to bite the bullet and do it. Since I did it, and I encountered such a difficult problem, I couldn't wait to solve all kinds of problems at once. This was for work, but also for my personal heroism. On the one hand, because I did not study the policy and was hasty and impatient, I first offended many people. On the other hand, because some people refused to change their prejudices and especially emphasized their own interests, my relationship with the masses became very bad, and even today some people do not understand me. Although some of the problems were gradually solved with the help of various parties inside and outside the school, new difficulties emerged one after another. Every time I passed a hurdle, I was complacent; when I was blocked by a hurdle, I was discouraged. Later, because I encountered several things that were approved by the superior in advance but were denied, I neither wanted to make suggestions to the superior nor could I bear it, so the old problem recurred, and I resolutely refused to do it. No matter how others persuaded me, I would never go into that president's office again. After dragging on for two months, the school was reorganized and the "college" was abolished, and my problem was over. Before these two months were over, I had awakened and felt that this was the unrestricted development of my own liberalism and independence, and the highest expression of irresponsibility, and was eager to find a way to remedy it. At that time, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government launched the work of research and improvement among all teachers, students, and staff of the Normal University. During that month, I did my best to make up for my mistakes. But every time I think about it, I always feel that this is something that I am sorry for the Normal University. Later, I was able to obey the organization's assignments in many things, because that mistake often condemned myself. Through recent study, recalling this incident again, I feel that: If I had known what it means to stand firmly on the people's position at that time, I would not have been absurd to that extent.

In short, I must thoroughly transform my thinking through this study, so that I can turn from a reformist into a Marxist-Leninist, and turn from a tool of reactionary rule into a teacher of the people!

    我必须翻身
    北京师范大学
    教育系教授董渭川
    武训问题一刀划开了我的改良主义包袱，使我恍然了我过去一直是运用自以为进步的改良主义给反动统治效劳的，并且承认了我这个人过去虽不太反动而头脑中却是潜伏着许多反动思想的。最近由于周总理的报告，使我进一步检查三十年来给反动统治效劳的种种事迹，感到自己是由帮闲、帮忙一直发展到帮凶，才因环境若干事实的教训，转而和反动统治对立，却还是以改良主义作对立的。我陆续有了这些反省，但还不敢说完全认识了我自己。
    我在中学、大学读书，都当军阀混战的时代。我进的是师范大学，从来没有人给我讲过教育和政治的关系；我愿意一辈子从事于“清高的”教育事业，而厌恶“混浊”的政治。我羡慕每天挟着皮包来去的教授先生们，当“教授”、有“学术”威望，是我人生的最高理想。所以在大学时代，我只埋头读书和教书（办夜校、在中学兼课），从未参加罢课游行等事。后来干教育，还是单纯把心思用在教育上，认定其他与我无涉。我对于同乡会、同学会等也概无兴趣，不参加任何组织活动，不想做官发财，不拍谁的马屁，倚靠自己的本领吃饭，独往独来，合则留不合则去，自命为“孤立派”，而且以此自豪。我恨谄上骄下的人，不论在哪里做事，从不靠近我的“上峰”，并且几乎每处都对我的“上峰”拍过桌子，甚至拂袖而去。
    我对政治有没有一套看法呢？没有。“五四”运动使我喜欢看介绍新思潮的书报，赫胥黎、达尔文、克鲁泡特金、马克思的学说我都重视。由于苏联革命的成功，使我相信马克思的学说，必然会推行到全世界，所以我在中学里教国文，也就经常介绍这些思潮；那时有一小部分青年因我而晓得了阶级斗争，而到后来走上革命之路。可是在我自己只是“谈谈”学问，与行动毫不相干。在天津南开时，同事范文澜先生介绍我加入一个进步的组织，并介绍我和负责人见过面，而我畏惧革命斗争的实践，一跑了之。
    跑到上海，第一次看见青天白日旗，以为蒋匪介石领导革命成了功，此后在乎努力于三民主义的实现，并且三民主义中的民生主义和共产主义差不多，就在心目中建立起了盲目的正统观念；对于共产党的活动，再也不注意了。
    在江苏当一个中学的校长，自以为有新的作风，而青年和我疏远了，甚且敌对了。为了他们闹风潮反对伪中央大学行政院（那时尚无教育厅）对于膳费的处置，我感于青年们不听我的话，又是一怒而去。他们闹风潮本非对我，这一来，就贴标语骂我“献媚中央”。经过二十多年，我不明了他们和我敌对的原因，直到解放后才恍然于我那时已是一个“正统派”了。
    后来我当过三个省的督学，深入各县与农村，知道了若干问题，而并不了解其本质。有一次，山东教育厅派我去曲阜师范查一件“赤化”的案子，我只玩了一趟，敷衍了事，原因是有了头一阶段的思想作基础，使我不反对共产党。这几年的工作，就我和反动统治的关系论，还可勉强说是帮闲，以后就开始帮忙了。
    从“九一八”到“七七”的几年，我在山东办民众教育，认为民众教育是一条“救国”的路，跟着“乡村建设运动”走，大卖力气，为反动统治起了搽粉的作用。这一段，是认真帮忙的开始。可是在我主观上仍旧是“超政治”的，我效法蔡元培先生的“兼容并包”，在一个民众教育机关内，蓝衣社、第三党、改组派、进步青年各色人物都有，我只要求他们努力于教育工作，其他不管。我自己有无爱憎呢？我瞧不起蓝衣社，不明了第三党和改组派，喜欢向左走的青年。
    济南行将沦陷，有杨希文、梁竹航等几位朋友想留我在山东打游击，我无此勇气，只有逃难。逃到反动派所谓后方，于是乎走上了帮凶之路。起初是替伪教育部领导从各省逃出的民众教育工作人员，宣传抗战，时期甚短，并没干了什么。后来就不同了。我被邀去广西，帮邱昌渭设计过一套把人民训练为奴隶的“成人教育年”，在主观上却以为是加紧教育人民起而抗战。接着看见蒋匪介石手订的“管教养卫合一”的“新县制”和“国民教育实施纲领”公布，我竟然以为这都是有助于抗战的，遂左一篇、右一篇地发表文章，对之大捧特捧。这因为，我既然跟着蒋匪介石逃难，而又由蒋介石匪帮的节节败退，认识了伪政权的贪污腐化，抱着“恨铁不成钢”的心理，一看见有新花样出来，就产生希望与幻想。并且我受一种谬说的欺骗，认为蒋匪介石本人是好的，只是他的左右不好；所以对他本人总怀着好感。我厌恶“新生活”的那些琐碎条款，却觉得“青年守则”是正当的，所以我在桂林的“江苏省立教育学院”时，曾随同轮值讲解“青年守则”，以制造奴隶。
    后来革命与反革命的力量在学校中逐渐地有短兵相接之势。我呢？抱着“超政治”的“中间态度”，而且因为在内心中对共产党有一点点同情，遂滑稽地自封为“中间偏左”。可是每遇学校大批开除学生，我以系主任或教授代表的资格出席校务会议，看到势必出此，心中虽然气愤，却一声不响，只有回家发发牢骚完事。有时我预先得知伪政府要逮捕学生，即通知某些学生当心或者准备离开，也有时帮他们设计出走，但从未积极反抗过。甚至于在开会时看见学校当局拿出来的黑名单是伪教育部来的，遂真以为学校当局系奉令行事、无可奈何，会后还把这种话欺骗学生。
    最深刻的一次印象是：江苏教育学院的反动院长高阳在阴历除夕开除大批学生，并立即把他们驱逐出校，使他们在元旦前夜无处栖身。我在那次会上噤若寒蝉。
    在江苏教育学院关门之后，院长高阳因压制进步力量有功，调升为广西大学校长。他拉我当秘书，我虽不愿干行政，而无法推脱。跟着他，用大批宪兵武装“接收”，接着逮捕和开除了若干学生。我干了一个月就坚决辞职，专门教书。他那些反动行为，我毫未与谋；但不容否认，事实上又是我帮凶的一次纪录。
    在璧山时，伪国立社会教育学院的特务学生发动反苏游行，标语中有威胁教职员参加的字句。我看了虽然也不满意，但是有几位教师准备向训导主任许公鉴提出质问，邀我签名时，我不仅辞谢，并且竟然为怕学校塌台愿意调停这一冲突，这不是进一步的帮凶是什么！
    蒋介石匪帮的所谓“青年军”成立时，我一面名之曰“御林军”，又一面为他们写壁报稿子宣传，还代为募捐慰劳。原因是我不敢得罪那些特务学生。
    在苏州时，选举伪立法委员的运动进入学校，我不闻不问，但是训导主任来我家要图章代我选举时，我又无法拒绝了。
    还有一次，学生们罢了课，半夜里来敲门要我次晨对他们讲演。他们对我抱有多么大的期望呵！但是我无勇气，推辞不掉，就走上台去，面对着坐在前排的伪“苏州城防司令部”的几个特务，讲了一套
    “扫除文盲”完事。于今想来，简直是演了一幕滑稽丑剧！
    就以上回想所及的这些事，足以说明我这个人虽然承认了真理，却不敢接受真理，面对真理，为了过安逸的生活，为了向上爬，不惜一头倒在反动统治怀里，由帮闲、帮忙一直发展到帮凶，然而还自命“清高”、“超政治”，到解放后还自以为“历史清白”，“中间态度”。有时我心里小有矛盾，但为了“明哲保身”，卑怯的思想压制着正义感，畏首畏尾了几十年！
    最近和一个朋友谈起这些，他说：“你也战斗过呵！”这是就我在苏州的最后一段而言，但也令我惭愧！由于特务的无法无天，美帝国主义者在中国的为所欲为，通货膨胀到不可收拾，学生运动的再接再厉，……我对蒋匪介石由完全失望而恨入骨髓了，接连在上海大公报上发表了几篇给学生运动打气的文章，越写越冒火，不再怕什么了。这一来，从南京的新民报开始，一路到上海的几家报纸，说我被解聘了。不得已而北上。到了这个学生运动澎湃的文化故都，我在师范大学、辅仁大学公开讲演反对帝国主义、反对封建势力，在课堂上也分析这些问题，并且在围城期间，还对一部分中小学校长讲过“我们为谁而教育？”因而我获得了“进步教授”的头衔，可是我所讲的种种，骨子里还是从我的改良主义和教育万能论出发的。这种“战斗”，又是多么荒谬可笑呵！但无论如何，我那时确实有勇气站起来了。
    算总账，我在检讨武训问题时之所以自命为“不很反动”，是因为我没和蒋匪帮的任何小组织发生关系，我拒绝过朱家骅派我去西北师范学院当院长的任命，拒绝过北平师范学院聘我当训导长的邀请，还拒绝过特务们要我坐飞机南逃的胁迫，我没作这种种，遂自认反动而不很，但是在学习过周总理的报告，对于划分敌我的界限有了初步认识之后，自己过去的种种，越回忆就越觉得反动的程度够“很”的了！
    从这些回忆中，使我获得的教训是：我在大革命之后一直到抗战胜利这二十多年中间，始终和蒋匪介石一个立场，事实是很显然的。至于“中间路线”、“超政治”、“清高”等等，一切都是自欺欺人的想法；在双方斗争日益尖锐的情况下，尽管有“又吃鱼，又嫌腥”的感觉，事实是在天天吃着鱼，而且研究如何改良鱼的做法，到哪里去找“中间路线”？既然不可能有“中间路线”，还自鸣“清高”，“超政治”，岂不是当了几十年的骗子！
    解放后，虽然我主观上要求改造，但因背上了一个“进步的”包袱，没能正确地认识自己，也就未触到自己思想的本质，因而不断地犯过一些错误。歌颂武训只是我的显著的错误之一例。此外，我再举一个重大的例子，以说明我和人民立场的距离：北京解放不久，军管会派我当师范大学的校务委员兼代教育学院的院长。师范大学的教育学院是一个烂摊子，其中五个系，从系的任务、方向起，一直到人事、课程、教材、方法、年限处处是问题。我辞不掉，只有硬着头皮干；既然干了，而又遇上这样一个难题，就恨不能把各种问题一下子解决。这是为了工作，也为了自己的个人英雄主义。一方面因为我不研究政策，而又操切急躁，首先得罪了许多人，另方面因为有些人不肯改变自己的成见和特别强调自己的利益，所以我和群众之间的关系搞得很坏，到今天还有人对我不谅解。虽在校内外各方面的帮助下，陆续把问题解决了一部分，但新的难题层出不穷。每通过一个难关，就沾沾自喜；被难关挡住，就灰心丧气。后来因为有几次遭遇到预先征得上级同意而又被否定的事情，我既不肯对上级提出意见，而又不能忍耐，遂致老毛病复发，一甩袖子坚决不干。不管别人怎样劝说，反正我不再进那个院长办公室了。拖延两个月之久，赶上学校改组，取销了“院”，我的问题才算完事。这两个月未了，我已觉醒过来，觉得这是自己的自由主义和闹独立性的无限制的发展，是不负责任的最高表现，急于想法补救。那时中央人民政府教育部发动师范大学的全体师生职工从事研究改进的工作，在那一个月中，我尽了些力量，才算稍稍弥补了我的过失。但每次想起，总觉这是一件对不起师范大学的事。后来在许多事上我能服从组织分派，就由于那次过失时常谴责着我自己。通过最近的学习，再回忆这件事，就觉得：假如那时我懂得什么叫站稳人民的立场，一定不至于荒唐到那种程度。
    总之，我必须通过这次学习，彻底改造自己的思想，使我由改良主义者翻身为马列主义者，使我由反动统治的工具翻身为人民的教师！
