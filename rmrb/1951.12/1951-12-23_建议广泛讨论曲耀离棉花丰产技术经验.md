    Suggesting Broad Discussion of Qu Yaoli's Cotton High-Yield Technology and Experience
    Editor: I am a cotton promotion worker. Some time ago, I heard that Qu Yaoli of Shanxi harvested more than 900 jin of seed cotton per mu of high-yield cotton field, and I didn't believe it. I suspected that either the estimate was inaccurate, or his standards for "mu" and "jin" were different from those in general areas. Because based on my many years of work experience, I thought it was already rare and valuable for one mu of cotton field to harvest 400 to 500 jin of seed cotton. It wasn't until the 22nd of last month, when the People's Daily published the "Investigation Report on Qu Yaoli's Cotton High-Yield Achievements and Technical Experience" from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, which was completely reasonable and realistic, that my doubts were completely dispelled. This fully shows that I have empiricism and conservative views, and lack understanding of new things. This incident taught me a great lesson.
    Qu Yaoli's cotton planting technical experience is indeed very rich. But most of his techniques are also known to many cotton planters. Then, why is he the only one who can achieve such great results? Are the cultivation and moisture-preserving methods, sowing techniques, and the experience of applying more than 10,000 jin of organic fertilizer per mu that he used on slightly alkaline land also applicable to general soil? His cotton is all seedlings, sown before Grain Rain, but how can drought-prone cotton areas in North China ensure timely sowing and full seedlings? Is his "seedling control" method necessary for general cotton cultivation? Also, are his experiences of using urea to mix seeds before sowing and retaining some woody branches when pruning worth promoting? I think these issues need to be further discussed in order to correctly expand the influence of Qu Yaoli's high-yield experience. Jianye

    建议广泛讨论曲耀离棉花丰产技术经验
    编辑同志：我是一个棉花推广工作者。前些时候，听说山西曲耀离每亩丰产棉田收获九百多斤籽棉，很不相信。我怀疑不是估计失实，便是他的“亩”和“斤”的标准和一般地区的不同。因为我根据自己多年工作经验，认为一亩棉田能收获四、五百斤籽棉，已是难能可贵的了。直到上月二十二日，人民日报发表了中央人民政府农业部的“曲耀离棉花丰产成绩和技术经验的考察报告”，说得完全合情合理，实实在在，这才把我的怀疑彻底打消。这充分说明自己有经验主义和保守观点，对新事物缺乏认识。这件事给了我很大教训。
    曲耀离的植棉技术经验，确是很丰富的。但他的技术，大部分也是许多植棉者都会的。那末，为什么只有他能做出这样大的成绩来呢？他在带轻碱性的土地上采用的耕作保墒方法、播种技术和每亩施用一万多斤有机肥料的经验，是不是也适用在一般土壤上？他的棉花是全苗，播种在谷雨前，但像华北棉区十年九旱，旱地棉花如何也能保证及时播种和全苗？他的“蹲苗”办法，是不是一般棉花栽培都必须这样做？还有，他在播种前用尿拌种和整枝时保留一部分木枝的经验，是不是值得推广？以上这些问题，我觉得都需要进一步展开讨论，才能正确地扩大曲耀离丰产经验的影响。建业
