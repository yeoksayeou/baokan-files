Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 14th: British troops, illegally stationed in the Suez Canal Zone of Egypt, continue to act violently and tyrannically towards Egyptian residents in the area. In order to further suppress the patriotic struggle of the Egyptian people, the British troops forcibly opened a new military highway between the British military barracks and the water purification plant in Suez. Ignoring the protests of Egyptian residents, the British troops barbarously demolished houses in the village of Kafr Abdu in the Suez area on the 8th. The village had a total of seventy-five houses, including ten sturdy two- or three-story residences. The British troops dispatched approximately 10,000 soldiers, numerous armored vehicles, and "Centurion" tanks, and entered the village. Subsequently, bulldozers were sent to flatten the houses in the village.

This barbaric action by the British troops has aroused even greater anger among the Egyptian people and has further deteriorated relations between the Egyptian and British governments. The Egyptian cabinet decided on the evening of the 9th to dismiss all British officials and experts working in the Egyptian government. On the 11th, the Egyptian government submitted a protest statement to the United Nations, condemning the new acts of aggression by the British troops. On the evening of the 13th, the Egyptian government also announced the recall of its ambassador to London.

    英军拆毁埃及村庄民房的暴行
    激起了埃及人民更大的愤怒
     【新华社十四日讯】开罗消息：非法驻扎在埃及苏彝士运河区的英国军队继续在该地区横蛮地向埃及居民逞凶。英国军队为了便于进一步镇压埃及人民的爱国斗争，用武力强行在苏彝士的英军兵营和滤水厂之间，开辟一条新的军事公路。英军不顾埃及居民的抗议，在八日野蛮地把苏彝士地区卡夫拉布杜村的民房拆毁。这个村庄共有七十五座房屋，其中有十座是建筑坚固的两层或三层住宅。英军出动了约一万名军队、许多装甲车和“百人队长”式战车，开进这个村庄，随后就派了开路机把这个村庄的民房平毁。
    英军的这种野蛮行动，激起了埃及人民的更大愤怒，并已使英埃两国政府的关系进一步恶化。埃及内阁已在九日晚决定，把在埃及政府中工作的所有英国官员和专家都解职。十一日，埃及政府向联合国提出抗议声明，谴责英军的新侵略行动。十三日晚，埃及政府并宣布召回它派驻伦敦的大使。
