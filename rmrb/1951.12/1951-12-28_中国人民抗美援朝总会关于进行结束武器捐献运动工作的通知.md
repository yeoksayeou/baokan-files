    The China Peace Committee Regarding the Conclusion of the Weapon Donation Campaign
    Inspired by high patriotism, the people of the entire country enthusiastically responded to the call of the Committee on June 1st and launched a campaign to donate weapons. This campaign will victoriously complete its mission at the end of December this year. As of December 26th, the People's Bank of China headquarters has actually received over 47,280 billion yuan in payments from all over the country. At present, with the exception of a few provinces, cities, and units that have not yet completed their payment tasks, the vast majority of provinces, cities, and units have exceeded their original pledged figures. The total amount of payments actually received by the Committee has exceeded the total amount pledged by various regions of the country on October 30th by 19%. In order to ensure the successful conclusion of the donation work, the Peace Committees (branch organizations) and provincial, municipal, and county (banner) branch organizations should immediately and appropriately carry out the following work:
    (1) After the end of the collection of funds at the end of this year, the local general branches, provincial, municipal, and county (banner) branches should summarize the donation movement, affirm achievements, correct shortcomings, commend work models and donation models in the weapon donation movement, and through mass summary work, deepen the education of the patriotic convention, and encourage the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy to continue to support the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
    (2) All localities should immediately clear their accounts and announce them to the masses in January next year. The regulations are as follows:
    	1. The China Peace Committee announces the total amount of donations from major administrative regions, provinces, and major cities; the general branches of major administrative regions announce the total amount of donations from provinces and cities under their jurisdiction; the provincial branches announce the total amount of donations from cities and counties (banners) under their jurisdiction; each county (banner) announces the total number of townships or administrative villages under its jurisdiction; each township or administrative village announces the names of donors and the amount of donations from the unit.
    	2. The branch organizations of large, medium, and small cities and various donation units such as industrial and mining enterprises, schools, agencies, groups, and armies should, based on their specific circumstances, announce the names of donors and the amount of donations.
    	3. Announcement methods: Areas with newspapers should announce in the newspapers and broadcast on the radio; areas without newspapers or radio can use methods such as posting announcements to the masses. No matter what method is adopted, it must be announced to the masses, and ask if there are any errors, verify it, answer questions, and do all the closing work.
    (3) After the end of the donation movement, the local general branches and provincial and municipal branches should separately compile the pledged figures of people from all walks of life (such as workers, farmers, industry and commerce, students, cultural and educational circles, agencies, groups, and armies) and make a form together with the summary and report to the Committee in writing.
    The closing work of the donation movement for Resist America, Aid Korea weapons is as important as the pledge and collection work. Comrades in charge at all levels of the Committee must consult with all relevant parties to do the closing work carefully and without sloppiness.
