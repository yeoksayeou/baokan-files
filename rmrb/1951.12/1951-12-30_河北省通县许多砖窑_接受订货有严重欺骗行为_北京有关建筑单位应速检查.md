    Many Brick Kilns in Tong County, Hebei Province
    Engage in Serious Deceptive Practices When Accepting Orders
    Relevant Construction Units in Beijing Should Conduct Inspections Promptly
    The People's Court of Tong County, Hebei Province, has recently accepted over a dozen cases of brick kiln workers suing their employers for breach of contract and unpaid wages. From the case files, we discovered that this is not merely a breach of contract issue, but also a matter of unscrupulous merchants engaging in speculation, exploiting loopholes, defrauding state assets, and undermining national economic construction. The Tong County People's Government has paid close attention to this issue and has dispatched a task force to conduct a focused inspection of privately owned kiln operations within Tong County. The inspection revealed that the owners of twelve brick kilns, including Tongcheng, Daxing, Baohua, Heshun, and Baocheng, are all speculative and unscrupulous merchants, engaging in buying and selling without any goods and fraudsters, and are currently being dealt with. Heshun Kiln has four kiln factories, but in reality, it doesn't even own one mu of land per kiln. It rented a "kiln barrel," did not obtain a business license, and privately engraved a seal, which they used to defraud money all over Beijing. In order to defraud large sums of money, they colluded with other unscrupulous merchants to establish a "Joint Venture Cooperative" in Beijing and Tong County, and also established two "Offices" in both locations under the name of Heshun Kiln. Baohua Kiln took bricks from Daxing Brick Kiln and sold them in Beijing before building its own kiln. When brick purchasers came to inspect the kiln, the manager of Baohua Kiln would take them to Daxing Kiln. The deceptive tactics of these twelve brick kilns varied, but their essence of defrauding money everywhere was the same. The total capital value of the twelve brick kilns combined is only over one hundred million, while the amount of brick orders accepted from Beijing reached as high as twenty billion. Units that ordered bricks from these unscrupulous merchants included the China Construction Company, Xingye Investment Company, Times Construction Company, Bayi Kiln Factory, Xinmin Construction Factory, Xinmin Construction Engineering Department, Xingye Construction Company, Beijing Construction Company, Fengtai Materials Factory of the Ministry of Railways, Beijing Construction Materials Company, Da Zhonghua Construction Materials Company, Jianping Construction Factory, the People's Government of the Fourth Inner District of Beijing, the People's Government of the Second Inner District of Beijing, and Yusheng Construction Factory, among others. When approving bricks, they prepaid the brick kilns with 50%, 60%, 70%, or even 80% of the order amount, easily amounting to tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. Few of these brick kilns delivered bricks on time, or even at all. This not only delayed the construction of the capital but also severely undermined the national economy. The speculation and exploitation of loopholes by unscrupulous merchants also affected the business development of public and legitimate private brick kilns.
    The main reason for this is that the leading cadres of the various construction units do not pay enough attention to national interests. They undertake projects and purchase tiles and bricks without adequate planning. Secondly, it is because cadres have bureaucratic work styles, failing to conduct in-depth investigations and carelessly closing deals based solely on the superficial completeness of procedures (having a guarantor). Tongcheng Kiln pre-received 400 million in order payments, all guaranteed by the Hongtai Yuji Millet Grain Store established by the kiln manager Sha Yufu, but this business was not worth much at all. Shuang Sheng He, a Luo Di shop, guaranteed transactions worth over one hundred million. These loopholes provided opportunities for unscrupulous merchants to speculate, resulting in huge losses to state assets. The leading cadres of relevant construction units must conduct a profound self-criticism. As for those purchasing personnel, they deserve careful study. We believe that, apart from some personnel having bureaucratic work styles, others are highly suspected of engaging in corruption. In this anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign, relevant authorities should conduct thorough and strict investigations, and give appropriate education and punishment to those who have neglected their duties or engaged in corruption. Chen Zhen Wan Dianrong Zhao Zongtian
    Editor's Note: From this letter, we can clearly see how despicable and filthy the methods used by unscrupulous merchants are, and we can also clearly see how serious the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of certain construction units has become. They are using state assets to enrich unscrupulous merchants and undermine national economic construction. This is unacceptable to the state and the people. Relevant units should promptly investigate and handle these matters, and give unscrupulous merchants and personnel who have neglected their duties or engaged in corruption the punishment they deserve.

### 河北省通县许多砖窑  接受订货有严重欺骗行为  北京有关建筑单位应速检查

    河北省通县许多砖窑
    接受订货有严重欺骗行为
    北京有关建筑单位应速检查
    河北省通县人民法院，近来受理了十几起砖窑工人控诉资方违约欠付工资的案件。我们从案卷中发现，这不只是违约问题，而且是奸商投机、钻空、骗取国家财富，破坏国家经济建设的问题。通县人民政府对这个问题极为注视，特抽调干部组成检查小组，对通县境内的私营窑业作了重点检查。先后查出通城、大兴、宝华、和顺、宝城等十二个砖窑的资方，都是些投机奸商，买空卖空的骗子，现正在进行处理。和顺窑设有四个窑厂，实际上一个窑一亩地都没有，租了个“窑桶”，不领取营业证，私刻了图章，就到北京到处骗钱。为了大量骗款，他们更纠合其他奸商，在北京、通县两地成立了
    “联营社”，又用和顺窑名义在两地成立了两个
    “办事处”。宝华窑在没有筑窑前，拿了大兴砖窑的砖，去北京卖。订砖人来验窑，宝华窑经理就把他领到大兴窑去。这十二家砖窑的欺骗方式不同，但到处骗钱的实质是一样的。合计十二家砖窑的资金总值不过一亿多，而接受北京的订砖款数竟达二十亿元之巨。向这些奸商订砖的，计有中国建筑公司、兴业投资公司、时代建筑公司、八一窑厂、新民营造厂、新民建筑工程部、兴业建筑公司、北京建筑公司、铁道部丰台材料厂、北京建筑器材公司、大中华建筑器材公司、建平营造厂、北京内四区人民政府、北京内二区人民政府、裕升营造厂等单位。批砖时，他们预付砖窑订款五成、六成、七成甚至八成，动辄几千万甚至几亿。这些砖窑，到期交砖的很少，甚至不交。不只耽误了首都的建筑，而且严重地破坏了国家的经济。奸商投机钻空，还影响了公营和正当私营砖窑的营业发展。
    推究原因，主要是由于各建筑单位的领导干部对国家利益重视不够。他们承揽工程，购瓦砖缺乏计划。其次，是因为干部有官僚主义作风，不深入调查，只从形式上看手续完备（有铺保）就马虎成交。通城窑向外批砖，预支订款达四亿元，都是这个窑经理沙玉符设立的洪泰玉记小米粮店的保，这商号根本不值几个钱。双盛合是一个罗底铺，就保了上亿的交易。这些都给奸商造成投机空隙，致使国家财产受到巨大损失。有关建筑单位的领导干部须作深刻检讨。至于那些采购人员，实在值得研究。我们觉得，他们之中除去部分人员是有官僚主义作风外，其他的人是否有贪污行为，嫌疑很大。在这次反贪污浪费的运动中，有关机关应作深入而严格的检查，分别给失职或贪污人员以适当的教育和处分。陈    真    万殿荣    赵宗田
    编者按：我们从这封来信中，清楚地看到了奸商使用的手段是多么卑鄙龌龊，也清楚地看到了某些建筑单位的领导干部的官僚主义作风，已经达到了如何严重的程度。他们用国家的资财，养肥了奸商，破坏了国家经济建设。这是国家、人民所不能容许的。有关单位应该迅速检查处理这些事情，给奸商和贪污失职的人员以应得的惩处。
