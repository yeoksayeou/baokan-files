The Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province exposed the massive embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan, the former Secretary of the CPC Tianjin District Committee, and Zhang Zishan, the current Secretary of the CPC Tianjin District Committee. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC has decided, with the approval of the North China Bureau, to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party. At the same time, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has, in accordance with the law, arrested the major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan on November 29th and December 2nd, respectively. In order to thoroughly investigate and handle this case, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has decided to establish an investigation and handling committee composed of Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, Xue Xun, member of the Hebei Provincial People's Government and Deputy Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, Li Guohua, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Supervision Committee, Sun Guangrui, Chief Procurator of the Provincial People's Procuratorate, and Song Zhiyi, President of the Provincial People's Court, to be responsible for handling this major embezzlement case.

Liu Qingshan, former Secretary of the CPC Tianjin District Committee and current Deputy Secretary of the CPC Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee, joined the Communist Party of China in June 1931. Zhang Zishan, current Secretary of the CPC Tianjin District Committee and former Commissioner of the Tianjin Special District, joined the Communist Party of China in October 1933. In the past, under the cultivation and education of the Party, they had done a lot of work for the Party and the people and made considerable contributions. After joining the Communist Party of China, Liu Qingshan participated in the peasant riots in Gaoyang and Lixian in 1932 and did not yield under torture after being arrested by the Kuomintang reactionary government. Zhang Zishan was arrested and imprisoned in 1934 and participated in hunger strikes and track-lying struggles. They were indeed worthy of being heroes in the face of the enemy. However, because they experienced a fundamental victory in the revolution, transitioning from a harsh environment of struggle against the enemy to a peaceful construction environment, and the leading organs moved from the countryside to the cities, they could not withstand the erosion of bourgeois ideology, developed serious individualism, self-importance, and a tendency to seek pleasure, and gradually became corrupt and degenerate. Furthermore, because they were arrogant and self-conceited, did not humbly learn, lacked the spirit of self-criticism, deceived those above and misled those below, suppressed democracy within the Party, and acted arbitrarily and willfully, they completely lost the noble qualities of a Communist Party member, betrayed the Party, and betrayed the people, resulting in serious crimes of undermining Party discipline, violating state laws, and stealing state assets, turning from revolutionary fighters into enemies of the revolution. Their main criminal facts are as follows: (1) Stealing state assets, exploiting the people, colluding with private merchants, and engaging in illegal business in the name of "organ production." The Tianjin District Committee set up a production management office in Tianjin, with ten production units under its jurisdiction. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, using their political privileges and government leadership positions, brazenly embezzled 2.89151 billion yuan of local grain funds, 3 billion yuan of special flood control and water conservancy funds (2 billion yuan has been repaid), 400 million yuan of disaster relief grain funds, 140 million yuan of relief grain funds for cadres' families, deducted 543.3 million yuan of food subsidies for airport construction workers, earned 374.73 million yuan from the supply of food to river management workers, illegally profited 2.2 billion yuan from reselling food for river management workers, and also fraudulently obtained 6 billion yuan in bank loans in the name of construction to engage in illegal business. The total amount above is 15.549954 billion yuan. In order to pursue a corrupt and degenerate life for themselves, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan disregarded Party discipline and state laws, disregarded the interests of the people, disregarded the river management and flood control projects related to the production and lives of millions of people, and disregarded the lives of countless disaster victims, and also disregarded the protests and warnings of comrades within the Party, stubbornly going their own way and stealing, deducting, and defrauding the property of the state and the people in many ways. Their crimes are no different from those of the Kuomintang reactionary bureaucrats. In July and August of this year, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan approved giving 4.94 billion yuan to Zhang Wenyi, a profiteer in Tianjin, and sent people to Hankou to speculate in the transportation of steel, with the aim of making huge profits. Zhang Wenyi, after obtaining this huge sum of money, deposited it in the bank to earn interest and engaged in other speculative businesses, disrupting financial prices and colluding to embezzle funds. The profiteer Zhang Wenyi alone embezzled nearly 1.4 billion yuan of state assets. In May of this year, when timber prices in Tianjin rose sharply, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, in order to make huge profits, sent people dressed in military uniforms and wearing People's Liberation Army insignia, posing as military officers, to illegally transport 4,000 cubic meters of timber from the Northeast. This illegal transport of timber also privately misappropriated disaster relief funds, which have not yet been returned, seriously affecting the production and lives of disaster victims in the water towns.

    (2) Undermining state institutions and exploiting river management workers. In February of this year, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan colluded with private merchants to establish a construction company in Tianjin. Liu Qingshan even resorted to unscrupulous means to undermine the organization of state engineering construction institutions and state-owned and public construction companies, luring 31 engineering and technical personnel from state-owned and public enterprises in Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, and other places with salaries twice as high. This matter affected some technical personnel in the Anshan Construction Company, who demanded salary increases or resigned. The Anshan Construction Company sent people to the Tianjin People's Court to report the case, but Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, and others not only did not admit their mistakes, review and correct them, but instead used despicable means such as giving banquets and bribes to cover up the matter, and attacked comrades who opposed this. Last autumn and this spring, when repairing the Chaobai and Yongding Rivers, the Hebei Provincial People's Government instructed the Tianjin Special Office to organize migrant worker supply stations. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan took the opportunity to use public grain supplied to more than 100,000 migrant workers for their illegal business. Liu Qingshan personally proposed a requirement to the supply station to "earn 3 billion yuan," and Zhang Zishan personally presided over increasing the prices of grain, oil, and vegetables, making them higher than the market price, and extensively exploited the migrant workers. Under their erroneous instructions, the supply station sold bad grain as good grain, bought at low prices, and sold at high prices; and used the guise of supplying migrant workers to increase the conversion rate of grain transfer and evade taxes. The quality of the grain was extremely poor. The migrant workers were greatly dissatisfied with this and discussed: "They (referring to Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan) are making a fortune, enjoying riding in cars and watching big operas, while we are suffering."

    (3) Embezzlement and waste, blatant bribery. In order to facilitate their personal arbitrary squandering, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan designated special personnel to manage secret expenses in their "organ production," with no formal accounts and no expense procedures, and the finances were extremely chaotic. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan used their authority to seize production public funds and arbitrarily squandered them on gifts. According to their current confessions, the expenses have reached more than 300 million yuan (still under investigation). Liu Qingshan even degenerated to the point of taking drugs, using the excuse of being ill for long-term recuperation. After a doctor's examination, he was found to be healthy but was actually addicted to heroin. Under the influence of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, the expenses of the District Committee and the Special Office were also extremely extravagant and wasteful. Their production management office bought a total of seven cars, spending nearly 1.2 billion yuan. To buy cars, they sent people to Hong Kong and Guangzhou three times and bought high-end American-made sleeping cars produced in 1950. In order to cover up their crimes, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan openly bribed people, gave gifts and banquets everywhere, and wooed cadres. In order to destroy the evidence of these squanderings, Zhang Zishan personally burned 378 receipts at one time in July, and also instructed others to destroy a part of the receipts.

    (4) Deceiving superiors and suppressing subordinates, being self-important, and acting arbitrarily. The criminal actions of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan had long aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the vast number of cadres inside and outside the Party in the Tianjin area, but because of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan's consistent patriarchal style, suppressing democracy, and suppressing criticism, many cadres dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. Zhang Zishan even absurdly promoted that there could only be "one leader" and "one head" within the Party in the Tianjin area, meaning that everything should be dictated by him, which completely violated the Party's principle of democratic centralism. Liu Qingshan once said: "The world was conquered by me, isn't it right to enjoy a little!" to suppress others' criticism of them. If someone held an opposite attitude to them, expressed disagreement with their actions, or reported to higher authorities, they would inevitably be subjected to their scolding, attacks, and exclusion. Many active Party members were attacked by them. Someone wrote a letter to the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee to accuse Zhang Zishan, but not only was the accusation letter suppressed and unable to reach higher authorities, but even the letter from the Organization Department of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee inquiring about this accusation was also suppressed by them. Regarding the exploitation of river management workers, someone once raised an objection to Zhang Zishan, but Zhang Zishan not only did not accept it but instead reprimanded the comrade who raised the objection, saying, "What position are you speaking from?" It seemed that standing on the side of the people was wrong, while standing on the side of Zhang Zishan's embezzlement was right. How absurd!

Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan have thus degenerated into traitors of the Party and the people, and have become moths that embezzle and steal state property.

    刘青山、张子善盗窃国家资财的罪行
    【本报讯】中国共产党河北省第三次党的代表会议，揭发了前任中共天津地委书记刘青山和现任中共天津地委书记张子善的巨大贪污案。中共河北省委已决定并经华北局批准开除刘青山、张子善的党籍；同时，河北省人民政府已依法于十一月二十九日、十二月二日先后将大贪污犯刘青山、张子善逮捕在案。为彻查处理这一案件，河北省人民政府已决定由河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席、河北省人民政府委员、中共河北省委纪律检查委员会副书记薛迅、省人民监察委员会副主任李国华、省人民政府检察署检察长孙光瑞、省人民法院院长宋志毅等五人组织了调查处理委员会，负责处理这一巨大贪污案件。
    刘青山，前任中共天津地委书记，现任中共石家庄市委副书记，于一九三一年六月加入中国共产党。张子善，现任中共天津地委书记、前天津专区专员，于一九三三年十月加入中国共产党。他们过去在党的培养教育下，曾为党为人民作了不少工作，有过相当贡献。刘青山在加入中国共产党后，曾参加过一九三二年的高阳、蠡县的农民暴动，被国民党反动政府逮捕后，在严刑逼供下丝毫没有屈服。张子善一九三四年被捕入狱，曾参加绝食斗争和卧轨斗争。他们在敌人面前确实曾经不愧为英雄好汉。但因为他们在革命取得基本胜利，由残酷的对敌斗争的环境转为和平建设的环境，领导机关由乡村转入城市以后，经不起资产阶级思想的侵袭，发展了严重的个人主义、居功自傲、贪图享受的错误倾向，逐渐腐化堕落下去。又因他们骄傲自大，不虚心学习，没有自我批评的精神，瞒上欺下，压制党内民主，一切自作主张，为所欲为，终于完全丧失了共产党员的高尚品质，背叛了党，背叛了人民，造成了破坏党纪、违犯国法、盗窃国家资财
    的严重罪恶，由革命的战士变成了革命的敌人。他们的主要罪恶事实如下：（一）盗窃国家资财，剥削人民，勾结私商，借
    “机关生产”名义进行非法经营。天津地委在天津市专设一生产管理处，下辖十个生产单位。刘青山、张子善二人，利用政治特权和政府负责地位，竟擅自盗窃地方粮款二十八亿九千一百五十一万元、防汛水利专款三十亿元（已还十亿元）、救灾粮款四亿元、干部家属救济粮款一亿四千万元，克扣修理机场民工补助粮款五亿四千三百三十万元，赚取治河民工供应粮款三亿七千四百七十三万元，倒卖治河民工食粮从中渔利二十二亿元，此外并以修建为名骗取银行贷款六十亿元，从事非法经营。以上共计一百五十五亿四千九百五十四万元。刘青山、张子善为了追逐个人腐化堕落的生活，竟如此不顾党纪法纪，不顾人民利益，不顾关系数百万人民生产和生活的治河防汛工程，更不顾无数灾民的生命，亦不顾党内同志的抗议和警告，一意孤行，多方盗窃克扣骗取国家人民的财产。其罪恶和国民党反动官僚毫无二致。今年七、八月间，刘青山、张子善批准交给天津市奸商张文义四十九亿四千万元，派人到汉口投机贩运钢铁，以图暴利。张文义得此巨款，曾存放银行生息并进行其他投机生意，扰乱金融物价，借此合伙贪污。仅奸商张文义即侵吞国家资财近十四亿元。今年五月间，天津市木材价格高涨，刘青山、张子善为图暴利，派人穿上军服、佩带人民解放军符号，冒充军官，到东北盗运木材四千立方米。此次盗运木材，竟又私自盗用了救灾款项，至今尚未归还，严重影响了水乡灾民的生产和生活。
    （二）瓦解国家机构，剥削治河民工。今年二月，刘青山、张子善与私商勾结在天津成立建筑公司，刘青山竟不惜以无耻手段，瓦解国家工程建设机关和国营公营建筑公司的组织，前后以高一倍的薪金利诱天津、沈阳、鞍山等地国营公营企业机关的工程技术人员三十一名。此事曾影响到鞍山建筑公司有些技术人员要求增薪或辞职。鞍山建筑公司派人到天津市人民法院告发，刘青山、张子善等不但不承认错误，检讨纠正，反以请客、贿赂等卑鄙手段掩息下去，对反对这样做的同志则加以打击。去秋今春修治潮白、永定等河流时，河北省人民政府指示天津专署组织民工供应站，刘青山、张子善竟趁机使用供给十余万民工的公粮，作他们的非法生意。刘青山亲自向供应站提出“赚三十个亿”的要求，张子善并亲自主持提高粮、油、菜价，使之均高于市价，大肆剥削民工。在他们的错误指示下，供应站即以坏粮当好粮卖，低价买进，高价卖出；并借供应民工的牌子，提高调粮折合率，逃避税收，粮质极坏。民工对此大为不满，纷纷议论：“他们（按指刘青山、张子善）发大财，好坐汽车看大戏，我们吃苦头。”
    （三）贪污浪费，公行贿赂。刘青山、张子善为便于个人任意挥霍，在他们的“机关生产”中指定专人掌握秘密开支，既无正式账目，又无开支手续，财务极为混乱。刘青山、张子善利用职权攫取生产公款，任意挥霍送礼。据现在自供的即开支达三亿多元（尚在继续侦讯）。刘青山竟堕落到吸食毒品，藉口有病长期休养，经医生检查无病，实系犯了白面瘾。在刘青山、张子善的影响下，地委和专署机关开支也极为铺张浪费。他们的生产管理处前后共买汽车七辆，用款近十二亿。为买汽车曾派人去香港、广州三次，买来一九五零年出品的美制高等卧车。刘青山、张子善为了掩盖自己的罪恶，公开行贿，到处送礼请客，拉拢干部。张子善为了消灭这些挥霍的证据，于七月间一次即亲手焚毁单据三百七十八张，此外还指示他人代毁一部单据。
    （四）欺上压下，居功自傲，独断专行。刘青山、张子善的罪恶行为，早已引起天津地区党内外广大干部的极端不满，但因刘青山、张子善一贯的家长制作风，压制民主，压制批评，因此很多干部敢怒而不敢言。张子善竟极端荒谬地宣传在天津地区党内只能有“一个领袖”、“一个头”，意思是一切应由他独裁，这完全违背了党的民主集中制的原则。刘青山则曾说：“天下是老子打下来的，享受
    一点还不应当吗！”以此压制别人对他们的批评。如有人与他们持相反的态度，对他们的行为表示不同意，或者向上级报告时，就必然遭到他们的谩骂、打击和排挤。很多党内的积极分子都被他们打击。有人写信向中共河北省委控诉张子善，不但控诉书被他们扣压不能上达，即连中共河北省委组织部查询这一控诉的信件，也被他们扣压。为剥削治河民工的事情，曾有人向张子善提出意见，张子善不但不接受、反而斥责提意见的同志说：“你们站在什么立场说话？”似乎站在人民立场倒是错误的，而站在张子善的贪污立场上就对了，这是何等的荒谬！
    刘青山、张子善就是这样地堕落成了党和人民的叛徒，成了贪污、盗窃国家财产的蟊贼。
