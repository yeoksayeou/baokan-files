Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 22nd—Our frontline correspondent reports: While the American aggressors shamelessly persist in various unreasonable suggestions and absurd demands at the conference table in Panmunjom, they are also increasing their military activities on the front lines, launching frequent attacks everywhere with entire battalions and companies. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, standing ready, resolutely struck the invading enemy, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy forces. In the western sector, the enemy attacks daily, but all have failed. On the night of the 11th, more than 300 enemy soldiers attacked Namsan, south of Shangpu, and another high ground, and retreated after more than 100 were killed or wounded by our forces. On the morning of the 14th, an enemy battalion, under the cover of eight aircraft, nine tanks, and many artillery pieces, launched a frenzied attack on an unnamed high ground east of Shari. A certain unit of our army rose up to meet the attack, and after several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy, paying heavy casualties, occupied a small hilltop east of this high ground. However, our army then launched a counterattack, recaptured this hilltop, and killed or wounded many enemies. At 6 p.m. on the 16th, an enemy battalion launched a two-pronged attack on our army's positions in Shangpu and Xiapu, northwest of Lianchuan. By 1 a.m. the next day, the enemy's repeated attacks had been bravely repelled by our army, and more than 120 were killed or wounded. It is worth noting that the American aggressors have recently often threatened the safety of the Korean armistice negotiation conference site with military actions, but such conspiratorial activities have been crushed by a certain unit of our army, which resolutely defends the neutral zone. The day after the incident on the 11th when American aircraft once again invaded the Kaesong neutral zone, the American aggressors again drove a battalion of the puppet Rhee army to the vicinity of Xichangli and Zuoshao, south of Panmunjom, and crossed the Shachuan River to launch a fierce attack on our Cangkouli position. A certain unit of our defending forces met the attack with fierce artillery fire, repelling the enemy's advance. In the central sector, a certain unit of our army also repelled the enemy's repeated attacks in areas such as Mugwandong, Kimhwa, and near the Bukhan River. On the 13th, 13 enemy tanks and more than 70 infantrymen attacked an unnamed high ground northwest of Kimhwa in separate routes, but were repelled by our fierce artillery fire, and two tanks were destroyed. In the eastern sector, where the climate is the coldest, a certain unit of our army also inflicted casualties on the invading enemy in blocking and counter-attacking battles. On the 12th, a contingent of enemy troops attacked an unnamed high ground on the east bank of the Bukhan River, but were repelled by our artillery fire. On the west coast, on the night of the 13th, a certain unit of our coastal defense forces, with the cooperation of powerful artillery fire, crossed the sea to attack the enemy forces entrenched on Pidao Island at the mouth of the Datong River. The battle lasted until 4 a.m. the next morning, when the entire island was recovered, and a part of the enemy forces were killed or wounded, and 16 enemies, including a company commander, were captured.

    美国侵略者一面拖延谈判一面频繁进攻
    我军严阵以待予犯敌重创
    大同江口我海防部队收复避岛
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略者一面在板门店的会议桌上无耻地坚持各项无理建议和荒谬要求，一面又增强其在前线的军事活动，在各处用整营整连的兵力发动频繁的进攻。严阵以待的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚决打击了犯敌，予敌军以重大的杀伤。在西线地区，敌军每天都有进攻，但都失败了。十一日夜间，敌军三百多人向上浦防南山和另一高地进攻，被我杀伤一百多人后溃退。十四日晨，敌军一个营在八架飞机、九辆战车和很多大炮的掩护下，向沙是里以东一个无名高地疯狂进攻。我军某部奋起迎击，激战数小时，敌人付出重大伤亡后侵占了这个高地以东的小山头。但我军随着发起反击，夺回了这个山头，并杀伤了很多敌人。十六日下午六时，敌军一个营分两路猛攻涟川西北上浦防、下浦防我军阵地，打到第二天一时，敌多次猛攻都被我军英勇击退，并被杀伤一百二十多人。值得注意的是：美国侵略者最近常常以军事行动威胁朝鲜停战谈判会议地点的安全，但这种阴谋活动都被坚决保卫中立区的我军某部所粉碎。在十一日美国飞机又一次侵袭开城中立区事件发生后的第二天，美国侵略者又驱使李伪军一个营窜到板门店以南的西场里及左哨一带，并渡砂川河猛烈攻击我仓内里阵地。我守军某部用猛烈的炮火迎击，击退了敌人的进犯。在中线，我军某部也击退了敌军在牧馆洞、金化、北汉江附近等地的多次进攻。十三日，敌军战车十三辆和步兵七十多人分路进攻金化西北一个无名高地，遭我炽烈炮火击退，并被击毁战车二辆。在气候最冷的东线，我军某部也在阻击战和反击战中杀伤进犯的敌军。十二日，敌军一股攻我北汉江东岸一个无名高地，遭我炮火击退。在西海岸，十三日夜，我海防部队某部在强大炮火配合下，渡海攻击盘踞在大同江口避岛的敌军，战斗到第二天早晨四时，全部收复该岛，并毙伤敌军一部，俘敌连长以下十六名。
