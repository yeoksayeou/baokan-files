　　The Voice of the People
　　By Soviet Writer Ilya Ehrenburg

　　There is an old fairy tale: a wolf wants to eat Little Red Riding Hood, so it disguises itself as a kind old grandmother, puts on the grandmother's bonnet, and smacks its lips amiably, but forgets to hide its long teeth.

　　In recent weeks, the jackals that dwell on the banks of the Potomac River (Note: Washington, the capital of the United States, is on the banks of the Potomac River) have purchased large quantities of pigeons, felled many olive branches, and hurriedly practiced a set of angelic, peace-loving speeches. Unfortunately, on the eve of the second meeting of the World Peace Council, a week before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, a frantic thing happened: the special issue of the widely circulated American magazine "Collier's," depicting an anti-Soviet war, was published. According to the editors, this issue took nine months to prepare. Not only that, the contributors to this issue included not only famous writers, but also "authorities on political, military, and economic issues, as well as senior officials in Washington and experts on international affairs." In short, the "Collier's" special issue and Mr. Acheson's "peace plan" delivered in Paris were produced in tandem. The American wolves wanted to put on a grandmother's bonnet for everyone, but they forgot to hide their teeth.

　　The reason why "authorities" and "senior officials in Washington" published the "Collier's" special issue was to prove to naive Americans that a third world war is inevitable; to prove that this war would be a profitable business and a pleasant trip for those living in the New World. The magazine's cover featured a Soviet map stamped with "occupied" and American occupiers - American military police - with bayonets drawn, looking like purebred Nazi SS members.

　　The reporters of "Collier's" magazine meticulously described the destruction of Soviet cities and the mythical victory of the Americans. Needless to say, anyone who can think would be surprised by this megalomania. They clearly remember the dizzying state of the Americans after clashing with Hitler's defeated divisions in Belgium and France. They would think that the soldiers who suffered heavy blows on the Korean battlefield still dream of invading the world's largest country! However, "Collier's" seems to assume that there are no people among its millions of readers who use their brains to think. The editorial department instructed one reporter to describe the destruction of Moscow, another to describe the paratroopers, and a third to write victory reports. This is not ordinary stupidity and boasting, this is skyscraper-style stupidity and record-breaking boasting. It is very easy to win a great victory in an American magazine, and frankly, it doesn't take nine months... There is an old military song:

　　Talking about open ground on paper,
　　Forgetting about the valleys altogether,
　　But when the army marches...

　　The "Collier's" editorial department should think about the valleys, think about the path of Hitler's bandits - from the wild boasting at the Nuremberg stadium to the gallows in the same city.

　　After vividly describing the destruction of the Soviet Union and the whole of Europe, the American writers began to dream about what kind of paradise there should be on Earth. Here are a few draft plans from these mad gentlemen:

　　"Soviet factories will be sold or leased to foreign entrepreneurs."

　　"The Red Army Theater will be renamed the New World Theater, and the American comedy 'Slackers and Women' will be staged here."

　　"Moscow's largest newspaper will publish the story of movie star Jenny James on the front page, titled: 'My Love and Heartbreak in Slovakia.'"

　　"'Collier's' magazine will be published in Russian in Moscow."

　　It is hard to imagine anything more vile and absurd than this. A magazine backed by Morgan dreams of destroying half the world so that Morgan can seize Soviet factories and so that his magazine can be sold in Russia.

　　The "Collier's" special issue shocked the entire Western public opinion. The bloody ink of the Washington "big shots" has, needless to say, aroused the indignation of peace defenders. Even those newspapers that act according to the colors of the White House and the State Department, if not angry, are also flustered. The French newspaper "Le Monde" called this issue of "Collier's" a "provocation." Even in the United States, many newspapers that no one can doubt would sympathize with the Soviet Union expressed their protest. I don't think Mr. Acheson would be particularly satisfied with the megalomania of his colleagues who wrote the "Collier's" special issue. There is a season for everything, and the day the magazine was published was not the right time; hadn't the American representatives to the United Nations General Assembly decided to give a speech about loving peace? Who can the grandmother's bonnet fool? The teeth on the cover of "Collier's" are too prominent.

　　The "Le Monde" correspondent in Washington, in the newspaper's November 6th commentary on why Mr. Acheson did not talk about the atomic bomb test at the Las Vegas bombing range in Paris, but decided to talk about peace, wrote: "It is necessary to run ahead of the Soviet Union... The strategy remains the same, only the tactics have changed. It is admitted here that Moscow's propaganda for defending peace has achieved considerable success. This propaganda can no longer be ignored." The same reporter reported that Washington officials are not satisfied with the European satellite states - the jackals on the banks of the Potomac believe that only Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece are performing well. "Le Monde" wrote: "The Russians are calling everywhere: 'We demand a peace treaty.' Does everyone see what kind of influence this proposition has on public opinion in various countries? All the signatures collected by the 'peace defenders' were not obtained through threats and deception... Have the strategists of the Cold War forgotten the particularly important significance of psychological weapons?"

　　These words from an organ willing to act as a lackey - the 49th or 59th state of the United States - are quite candid.

　　Undoubtedly, Mr. Acheson believes that the representatives of many countries attending the United Nations General Assembly are absolutely obedient. But he understands that voting cannot solve the problem. In addition to hundreds of yes-men diplomats, there are also millions of people. People are seriously considering: is it worth dying to publish the Russian version of "Collier's"? Millions of people are asking why they have to suffer on the banks of the Seine, the Tiber, the Thames, the Nile, and the Ganges? Why do the jackals on the banks of the Potomac control their destiny? Acheson's "love of peace" is not explained by the soft-heartedness of the tycoons, but by the power of the peace defenders. Just a year ago, the "big shots" in Washington, when talking about the Stockholm Declaration and the World Peace Congress, just smiled contemptuously, but now they no longer smile and hurriedly put on the grandmother's bonnet.

　　I would never overstate the achievements that have been made, the danger has not been eliminated. "Le Monde" is right, the Washington beasts have changed their tactics, but they have not changed their strategy. They will never give up their conspiracies, but they have to be evasive, play tricks, and have to put this issue of "Collier's" in their briefcase and take out a speech covered with stinky and long phrases advocating "peace" but concealing war plans. They know that they can quickly become closer to Tito and the Turkish Royal Guard.

　　The second meeting of the World Peace Council closed just as the United Nations was meeting. Representatives of people from all over the world formulated a program for peace and handed it over to the representatives of governments of various countries. Many representatives who attended the Vienna conference, such as Boulier, Mrs. Street, and other directors, spoke to the United Nations. They pointed out that the United Nations, bearing the expectations of people from all over the world, has left the path of peace. Neither Boulier, nor the Australian women's representative Mrs. Street, nor other directors, wanted to see the United Nations collapse - as the American newspapers said, they wanted to save the United Nations and restore the prestige it had lost in the suburbs of New York (Note: refers to Lake Success). The World Peace Council sent a letter to the United Nations General Assembly, presenting the thoughts and wishes of peace-loving people from all over the world. The United Nations General Assembly should not ignore this document, right? Of course, Mr. Acheson has a sufficient majority, but it is likely that Acheson himself also knows that in addition to these voices, there is a voice in the United Nations General Assembly that no one can silence, and that is the voice of the people.

　　When the great Chinese writer Guo Moruo spoke at the World Peace Council, he timely pointed out that if people go down the wrong road, they should turn back - this is the only way to achieve their goal. If you speed up on the wrong road, the result will be that you get further and further away from the goal. The road to peace is not through invading Taiwan, not through arming Nazi SS troops, not through destroying Korean cities, not through the farce in San Francisco, not through the arms race. The road to peace is through sincere agreements, through banning atomic weapons, and through guaranteeing equal security for large and small countries to reduce armaments. The United Nations has long been off the right track. No wonder the cover of the shameful "Collier's" issue is painted with the blue flag of the United Nations. These jackals tightly grabbed this flag as their military camouflage. However, the United Nations still has the possibility of leaving the war and embarking on the road to peace.

　　The Vienna Conference showed that the principle of actively defending peace has deeply penetrated people's hearts. We saw representatives from France and Vietnam, Britain and Burma, Egypt and Japan, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Morocco, representatives from all European countries, representatives from the Americas; world-renowned figures and humble representatives from peasant groups, churches, students, and trade unions. Representatives from various countries spoke about the need to strengthen cultural ties between countries. They spoke as representatives of people from various countries who would never allow foreign politicians to control their destiny. The lunatics at "Collier's" magazine determined that the summer of 1952 would inevitably be a summer of conflict. The World Peace Council, convinced of the power and vigilance of people from all over the world, has announced that the summer of 1952 will inevitably be a summer of peace. It announced that next summer it will exchange delegations, students will visit each other, and various cultural activities will be carried out to help people from various countries understand each other. We will soon know what attitude the United Nations General Assembly will take towards the true voice of people from all over the world. One is the road recommended by "Collier's" magazine - the road of conspiracy, hostility, expanding armaments, and finally a bloody war. There is also another road - the road to peace. We believe that mankind will definitely take this road.

　　人民的呼声
    苏联作家  爱伦堡
    有一个古老的童话：一只狼想吃掉红帽小姑娘，它打扮成慈祥的老祖母，围上了祖母的头巾，和蔼可亲地咂着嘴，可是却忘记了隐藏起它的长长的牙齿。
    最近几个星期，栖居在波陀马克河两岸的豺狼们（注：美国首都华盛顿在波陀马克河畔），购置下大批的鸽子，砍伐了好多橄榄树枝，慌慌张张地练习好了一套安琪儿式的爱好和平的讲演。不巧的是，在世界和平理事会第二次会议开会的前夜，联合国大会揭幕前一星期，发生了一桩手忙脚乱的事体：美国销路甚广的《柯里尔》杂志的描写反苏战争的专号出版了。据编者自称：这一期编写了九个月。不但如此，本期撰稿人不仅有著名的文人，而且还有“政治、军事、经济问题的权威人士和华盛顿的高级官吏以及国际问题专家。”一句话，《柯里尔》专号和艾奇逊先生在巴黎发表的“和平计划”是双管齐下，一道儿赶制出来的。美国狼本想给大家表演老祖母的头巾，可是它们却忘记隐藏起自己的牙齿了。
    “权威人士”和“华盛顿的高级官吏”之所以出版《柯里尔》专号，是要对天真的美国人证明：第三次世界大战是不可避免的；证明这一次大战对居住在新大陆的人们说来，一来是一笔赚钱的买卖，二来是一次惬意的旅行。杂志的封面印的是：打上了“占领”戳记的苏联地图和拔出刺刀的活象纯种的纳粹党卫军队员的美国占领者——美国宪兵。
    《柯里尔》杂志的记者们精雕细刻地描写了苏联各城市的毁灭和美国人的神话式的胜利。不消说，任何一个会用头脑来思想的人，都会对这种夸大狂感到吃惊的。他们很清楚地记得，美国人在比利时和法国同希特勒的残败的师团交锋后的那种蒙头转向的情形。他们会想到，在朝鲜战场上遭到了沉重打击的军人们还梦想侵略一个世界最大的国家！不过，《柯里尔》仿佛认定：在它的几百万个读者中间，用脑筋考虑问题的人是没有的。编辑部责成这一位记者描写莫斯科的毁灭，另外一位描写跳伞部队，第三位撰写胜利战报。这并不是普通的愚蠢和吹牛，这是摩天楼式的愚蠢和破纪录的吹牛。在美国杂志里面大获全胜是一件顶容易不过的事体，老实说，这用不着花九个月的工夫……有一只古老的军歌：
    纸上谈的都是开阔地，
    一股脑儿把山谷给忘记，
    可是，行起军来呀……
    《柯里尔》编辑部该想一想山谷，想一想希特勒匪徒的道路——从纽伦堡运动场上的瞎吹到同一个城市中的绞架。
    把苏联和整个欧洲的毁灭描写得淋漓尽致之后，美国的文人们开始梦想在地球上该有怎样的天堂了。下面是这班发了疯的绅士们的几张计划草案：
    “苏联的工厂将卖给或出租给外国企业家。”
    “红军剧院将改名为新大陆戏院，这里将上演美国喜剧《懒汉和女人》。”
    “莫斯科最大的报纸将在第一版上刊登电影明星珍妮·詹姆丝的故事，标题是：《我在撒洛瓦克的恋爱与失恋》。”
    “《柯里尔》杂志将在莫斯科用俄文出版。”
    很难想像还有比这更龌龊更荒谬的事情了。靠摩根做后台老板的杂志，梦想毁灭半个世界，以便摩根夺占苏联的工厂，以便使他的杂志在俄罗斯销行。
    《柯里尔》专号震惊了整个西方的舆论界。华盛顿“大头子们”的血淋淋的笔墨，不消说已经引起了和平保卫者的愤慨。就是那些看着白宫和国务院的颜色行事的报纸，即使说不是发怒也是慌乱了，法国《世界报》把这一期《柯里尔》叫做“挑衅”。甚至在美国，也有好多无论谁都不能怀疑说是会同情苏联的报纸表示了抗议。我不认为艾奇逊先生会对他这班动笔撰写《柯里尔》专号的同僚们的夸大狂特别满意的。什么季节有什么蔬菜，杂志出版的日子不是时候；美国在联合国大会的代表不是下定决心要讲一番爱好和平吗？老祖母的头巾能骗过谁呢？《柯里尔》封面上的牙齿太突出了。
    《世界报》驻华盛顿记者，在该报十一月六日给艾奇逊先生为什么在巴黎不讲拉斯·维加斯投弹场的原子弹实验，而决心大谈和平做了注解：“必须跑在苏联的前面……战略依然如故，只不过是战术改变了。此间承认，莫斯科的保卫和平的宣传已经获得了相当的成绩。对这一宣传再不能不予以回答了。”同一个记者报道，华盛顿人士对欧洲的仆从国家并不满意——波陀马克河岸上的豺狼们认为，只有土耳其、南斯拉夫和希腊表现得还好。《世界报》写道：“俄国人到处呼号：‘我们要求和平公约。’大家都看到这种主张对各国民意具有何等影响了吗？‘和平保卫者’所征集到的全部签名，都不是用威胁和欺骗取得的……莫不是冷战的战略家们忘记了心理武器的特别重要的意义吗？”
    这一甘愿充当小喽罗——美国第四十九州或五十九州的机关报所讲的话，算是坦白到家了。
    毫无疑问，艾奇逊先生相信出席联合国大会的许多国家的代表是绝对服从的。但是，他懂得，表决并不能解决问题。除掉几百个唯唯诺诺的外交家之外，还有千百万人民。人民在认真考虑：为了出版俄文版的《柯里尔》去送死，值得吗？千百万人民在发问，他们为什么要在塞纳河、第伯尔河、泰晤士河、尼罗河、恒河两岸上遭受苦难？为什么波陀马克河岸上的豺狼们支配着他们的命运？艾奇逊的“爱好和平”并不能由大亨心肠软，而应该由和平保卫者的力量来说明。仅仅在一年以前，华盛顿的“大头子们”，当谈到斯德哥尔摩宣言，世界和平大会的时候，还只是轻蔑地笑一笑，而如今他们再也不笑了，匆匆忙忙围上老祖母的头巾了。
    我决不过分夸大已经取得的成绩，危险并未消除。《世界报》讲得对，华盛顿的野兽改变了战术，却并未改变战略。他们是决不会放弃阴谋的，但是，他们却不得不躲躲闪闪，耍耍滑头，不得不把这一期《柯里尔》放在皮包里，掏出用主张“和平”的又臭又长的词句掩盖着战争计划的讲演稿。他们心里有数，他们很快就可以同铁托和土耳其的御林军们拉拢得更加紧密了。
    世界和平理事会第二次会议正当联合国开会的时候闭幕了。各国人民的代表们制订了和平的纲领，并把它转交给各国政府的代表。出席维也纳会议的许多代表，比方说，布利埃、斯崔特夫人和其他理事都对联合国讲了话。他们指出了背负着各国人民的期望的联合国，已经离开了和平的道路。不管是布利埃也好，澳大利亚妇女代表斯崔特夫人也好，不管是其他理事也好，都不愿意使联合国垮台——像美国报纸所讲的那样，他们是想挽救联合国，挽回它在纽约郊外（注：指成功湖）已经丧失了的威信。世界和平理事会致书联合国大会，向它陈述各国爱好和平的人民的思想和愿望。联合国大会该不会对这一文献置诸不理吧？当然，艾奇逊先生有足够的多数，但很可能艾奇逊本人也知道，除掉这些声音以外，联合国大会上还有一种谁都不能使它缄默的声音，这就是人民的呼声。
    中国的大作家郭沫若在世界和平理事会上发言时及时指出说，人们如果走错了路，就该回头——这是达到目的的唯一道路。如果加快了速度走错误的道路，其结果是越走离开目标越远。走向和平的道路，不是通过侵略台湾，不是通过武装纳粹党卫军，不是通过破坏朝鲜城市，不是通过旧金山的滑稽剧，不是通过军备竞赛。和平之路是通过真诚的协议，通过禁止原子武器和通过保证大小国家同等安全的裁减军备的道路的。联合国老早就不走正路了。难怪可耻的《柯里尔》的这一期的封面上绘有联合国的蓝色旗帜。这一群豺狼紧紧地把这面旗子抓过来作为他们的军事伪装。但是，联合国是还有离开战争的道路，走上和平的道路的可能性的。
    维也纳会议表明了积极保卫和平的道理已深入人心。我们看到了法国和越南的代表，英国和缅甸，埃及和日本的代表，印度，巴基斯坦，伊拉克，伊朗，摩洛哥，所有的欧洲国家的代表，美洲的代表；世界闻名的人物和农民团体、教会、学生和工会的谦逊的代表。各国的代表都讲到了必须加强各国的文化联系。他们以决不允许外国政客支配他们命运的各国人民的代表的资格发言。《柯里尔》杂志社的疯子断定一九五二年夏天必然是一个冲突的夏天。深信各国人民的力量和警觉性的世界和平理事会已经宣布：一九五二年夏天必然是一个和平的夏天。宣布明年夏天要互换代表团，学生互相访问和进行各种有助于各国人民相互了解的文化活动。我们不久就会知道，联合国大会对各国人民的真正呼声采取什么态度。一条是《柯里尔》杂志所建议的道路——阴谋、敌视、扩充军备以及最后是流血的战争的道路。另外还有一条道路——和平的道路。我们相信人类一定走这一条道路。
