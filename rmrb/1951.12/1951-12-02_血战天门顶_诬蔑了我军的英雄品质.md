    “Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak” Slanders the Heroic Qualities of Our Army
    The third volume, fifth issue of "People's Literature" published Bai Ren's article “Bloody Battle at Tianmen Peak,” which are four chapters from the author's novel "Fighting Until Tomorrow." The story outline is as follows: During the Anti-Japanese War, a unit of our army in Lunan escorted cadres to Luzhong. After completing the mission and returning, they discovered enemy activity at Tianmen Peak. On the third day of the battle, the enemy sent a letter urging surrender. At this time, the deputy company commander had already sacrificed himself, and the deputy political instructor actually gathered the troops to discuss the so-called issue of surrender! After this erroneous behavior was criticized, he said:
    “The joke can't go on any longer." (This is truly an intolerable joke!) Then he revealed his true intention: to "use a trick within a trick" and carry out a "fake surrender." In order to find an excuse for the "fake surrender," the author wildly and out of context distortedly quoted several sentences from Chairman Mao's "On Protracted War," such as "all warfare is based on deception," and "adopt various methods of deceiving the enemy, creating illusions for the enemy, and maneuvering the enemy within our scope," etc. As a result, the soldiers were actually persuaded and felt ashamed in front of the instructor. Thus, they accepted the surrender letter sent by the enemy and ridiculously sent out their own despicable surrender letter. Bai Ren foolishly distorted the proletariat qualities of the People's Liberation Army and also seriously distorted Chairman Mao's brilliant and great strategic and tactical thinking.
    Bai Ren's behavior of recklessly interpreting Chairman Mao's military thought not only demonstrates that Bai Ren's absurdity and ignorance have reached a very serious degree, but also exposes his lack of a clear revolutionary stance.
    Because the author's own soul contains filthy things, he has created such a thorough and hypocritical story, absurdly praising the benefits of "fake surrender." Isn't this defending capitulationism? It is universally known that the Chinese People's Army is essentially different from the reactionary armies. It has a glorious revolutionary tradition and noble political qualities. Precisely because of this, they can fight to the end for the interests of the people with unwavering loyalty. The strict political stance of our troops is a fundamental condition for defeating the enemy. The kind of violation of military discipline that fundamentally loses political ground, as praised by Bai Ren, is absolutely not allowed to exist in a revolutionary army. The author not only fabricated such a plot but also defended and promoted this erroneous behavior. In addition, in the same work, the author also erroneously described the position of political workers in our army and distorted the discipline and relationship between superiors and subordinates in our army.
    This error is by no means accidental. In some of his other works, such as "Target Straight Ahead" and "Little Iron Legs' Long March" ("Soldier Life Little Series" published by the Political Department of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army), the author has consistently started from concepts, created bizarre stories to attract readers, and exposed his petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies. Bai Ren's creative thinking obviously has serious errors, which should be quickly corrected, and his published works should be seriously reviewed.

### “血战天门顶”诬蔑了我军的英雄品质

    “血战天门顶”诬蔑了我军的英雄品质
    “人民文学”三卷五期发表了白刃的“血战天门顶”一文，这是作者长篇小说“战斗到明天”中的四章。故事梗概是这样：在抗日战争时期，鲁南我军某部护送干部到鲁中，完成任务后返回，在天门顶发现敌情。战斗到第三天，敌人来信劝降。这时副连长已牺牲，副指导员竟集合部队，提出所谓投降问题来讨论！当这种错误行为被指斥后，他才说：
    “玩笑不能再开下去了。”（这真是一个不能容忍的玩笑！）接着他说出他的真意是：“将计就计”，实行“假投降”。作者为了替“假投降”找藉口，狂妄到断章取义地歪曲引用毛主席的“论持久战”中的几句话：如“兵不厌诈”，“采用各种欺骗敌人的方法，造成敌人的错觉，调动敌人就我的范围”等。而这样一来，战士竟被说服，并在指导员面前觉得羞愧。于是，他们接受了敌人送来的劝降书，并荒唐地送出了自己的卑劣的投降书。白刃愚蠢地歪曲了人民解放军的无产阶级品质，也严重地歪曲了毛主席英明伟大的战略战术思想。
    白刃这种胡乱解释毛主席的军事思想的行为，不仅说明了白刃的荒谬无知已经达到了十分严重的程度，而且也暴露了他缺少鲜明的革命立场。
    由于作者自己的灵魂中存在着肮脏的东西，所以就制造了这样一个彻头彻尾的虚伪的故事，荒唐地歌颂了“假投降”的好处，这难道不是替投降主义作辩解吗？尽人皆知，中国人民军队是在本质上有别于反动派军队的，它具有光荣的革命传统和高贵的政治品质。正因为这样，他们才能够忠贞不屈地为人民利益作战到底。我们部队所具有的严格的政治立场，是战胜敌人的基本条件，像白刃所歌颂的这种根本失去了政治立场的违反军纪的行为，在革命的部队中是决不允许其存在的。作者不仅虚构了这样的情节，还替这种错误行为作了辩护和宣传。此外，作者在同一作品中还错误地描写了政治工作者在我军中的地位，歪曲了我军的纪律和上下级关系。
    这种错误决不是偶然的。作者在他的别的一些作品中，如“目标正前方”、“小铁腿长征记”（中南军区、第四野战军政治部出版的“战士生活小丛书”）也是一贯地从概念出发、制造一些离奇故事来吸引读者，暴露了他的小资产阶级的思想倾向。白刃的创作思想显然是有着严重的错误，应该迅速加以纠正，并对于他所已经发表的作品进行认真的检讨。
