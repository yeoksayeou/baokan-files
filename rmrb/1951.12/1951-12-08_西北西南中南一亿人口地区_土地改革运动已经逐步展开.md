    In the Northwest region, the land reform movement in areas implementing land reform this winter and spring has gradually unfolded. The areas implementing land reform this time have slightly increased compared to the original plan, including: thirty counties (cities) in the Ankang, Nanzheng, and Shangluo special districts of Shaanxi Province, thirty townships in the Guanzhong mountainous area, and fifty-six townships in the new areas inside and outside the Great Wall in the Yulin special district, sixty-five counties (cities) in Gansu Province, twelve counties (cities) in Ningxia Province, and six counties (cities) in Qinghai Province. The above totals six thousand and thirteen townships, with a population of approximately 15.4 million.
    More than 30,000 cadres are participating in this land reform work. Before the movement started, more than 200 townships in various regions had piloted land reform. Now, the land reform movement is gradually expanding from these 200 townships. It is expected that 3,000 townships will complete the work of land distribution before the Spring Festival next year, and more than 6,000 townships will be completed by May next year. After the completion of this land reform, except for the areas west of Yumen Pass in Gansu Province, the areas where Mongolians and Tibetans live in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Provinces, and the six counties in Qinghai Province where rent reduction is being implemented, the land reform in the agricultural areas of the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai will be fully completed.
    The areas in the Northwest implementing land reform this time include some rural areas where Hui and Han people live together, and Hui rural areas. In the past year, Hui farmers in various regions have urgently demanded the implementation of land reform. In the past rent reduction movement, these rural areas where Hui and Han people live together, and Hui rural areas have all implemented rent reduction, and the farmers' awareness has been raised, and many have joined the farmers' associations. In the past rural work, the People's Government has correctly implemented ethnic policies, promoted and cultivated a large number of Hui cadres, and strengthened the unity of the Hui and Han people. This year, after the Northwest announced the implementation of land reform in the region, the Hui people in various regions have enthusiastically supported it. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The third phase of the land reform movement in the Southwest region began in October. The areas implementing land reform in this phase include: fourteen whole counties including Tongliang and Yongchuan in the East Sichuan District, and parts of each of the five counties including Wulong and Shizhu; parts of each of the thirty-two counties including Xindu and Huayang in the West Sichuan District; parts of each of the twenty-five counties including Jianyang and Neijiang in the South Sichuan District, and parts of the suburbs of the three cities of Luzhou, Zigong, and Wutongqiao; fifteen whole counties including Xuanhan and Tongjiang in the North Sichuan District, and part of Bazhong County; thirty-nine whole counties including Zhaotong in Yunnan Province, and parts of each of the twenty-two counties including Xuanwei; twenty-three whole counties including Leishan and Puan in Guizhou Province, and parts of each of the thirty-five counties including Huishui and Zhenyuan; four whole counties including Yanyuan and Yanbian in Xikang Province, and parts of each of the two counties including Yuexi. The above ninety-five whole counties, one hundred and twenty-two counties and parts of the suburbs of three cities, have a total agricultural population of more than 38.8 million. The land reform in these areas will be completed in the two seasons of this winter and next spring.
    After the completion of this phase of land reform, the land reform in the Han areas of Sichuan and Xikang provinces will be basically completed, 89 percent of the areas in Guizhou Province will have completed land reform, and more than 45 percent of the areas in Yunnan Province will have basically completed land reform. In order to launch the third phase of the land reform movement, the Land Reform Committee of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, local People's Governments, and local Chinese Communist Party leading organs, have seriously summarized the experience of the second phase of land reform, and trained 70,000 cadres participating in land reform (including teachers and students from universities and middle schools and democratic people participating in land reform). (Xinhua News Agency)
    In the Central South region, a land reform movement will be carried out in areas with a population of 50 million this winter and next spring, and a land reform review will be carried out in areas with a population of 60 million. At present, various regions are actively preparing for land reform and land reform review.
    After the movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, the political awareness of the peasants in the Central South region has gradually increased, and a large number of cadres have been trained many times; the landlord class has been severely hit and has undergone new differentiation. These are favorable conditions for carrying out land reform and land reform review in the Central South region this winter and next spring. However, in some areas where the mass work foundation is weak, the peasants are not fully mobilized, and land reform has not been carried out, although the peasant masses are eager to divide the land, their political awareness and organization are still very poor, and there are different degrees of impurity in the rural grassroots organizations. In the areas where land reform has been implemented, according to the completion of land reform work, there are three types of townships: basically thorough, relatively thorough, and not thorough. The proportion of the first type of township is small, and there are still some outstanding issues. However, many rural work cadres and peasant masses have become paralyzed and relaxed due to victory. Therefore, the landlord class takes the opportunity to sabotage. In areas where rent and deposit refunds, anti-local tyrants, and land reform are not thorough, the destructive activities of the landlord class are even more rampant. In response to this situation, since August, the People's Governments and the Party Committees of the provinces in the Central South region have successively summarized the past peasant movement work, and deployed the land reform and land reform review work for this winter and next spring. The People's Governments and the Party Committees of the provinces have determined the steps for carrying out land reform and review this winter and next spring according to the specific situation, emphasizing that full preparations should be made to continue to mobilize the masses and thoroughly complete land reform, and insisting that land reform must be carried out in three stages: suppressing bandits and anti-local tyrants, rent and deposit refunds, class division, confiscation and requisition, distribution, and review. After that, various provinces actively carried out various preparations. Some provinces convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life. By the beginning of August, Jiangxi Province had trained 14,000 cadres, and Huaiyang Special District in Henan Province had trained more than 6,800 cadres. From July to September, Jingmen and other counties under Jingzhou Special District in Hubei Province trained 2,044 cadres, and also cultivated 48,146 rural cadres and peasant activists. The counties in Guangxi Province also centrally trained county and district cadres. The content of the training in various places is mainly to summarize the work, affirm the achievements and good work methods, criticize the paralysis and relaxation of some cadres, and study how to implement the land reform policy in the future based on the current rural situation. When training cadres, the People's Governments of many counties in Guangxi Province paid attention to guiding some intellectual cadres who had just joined the work to recognize the crimes of the landlord class and the suffering of the peasants, and at the same time, examine and criticize their own wrong ideas, which was very effective. In response to the paralysis and relaxation of cadres and peasant masses, the People's Governments and the Party Committees of the provinces in the Central South region paid attention to ideological education. For example, the New Hunan Daily launched a discussion and criticism on "Li Sixi's thought," and Henan Daily, Jiangxi Daily, Hubei Daily, and Hubei Peasant Daily also successively used Lei Yu, Wang Shuisheng, Wang Chengying, and Li Taiming as typical examples to launch ideological criticism. These educational works have achieved remarkable results.
    In order to create experience and train cadres, the provinces in the Central South region have successively carried out key experiments on land reform and review. The key review work in more than 30 counties in Henan Province is underway, and some areas have already ended. The key experimental work on land reform in many areas in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces has either ended or is being carried out. There are currently 246 villages in Guangxi Province that are conducting land reform experiments.
    In order to vigorously support the land reform movement this winter and next spring, and also to improve the revolutionary consciousness of cadres, the People's Governments in various regions of the Central South region have mobilized a large number of government personnel to go to the countryside. Teachers and students from universities, various parties, and people from all walks of life in the Central South region have also expressed their firm support for the peasants' anti-feudal struggle and enthusiastically signed up to participate in the land reform movement.

    The peasants in Hongdong Township, Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, obtained more fruits of victory in the land reform than other townships. They carried forward class friendship and voluntarily took out a part of it to give to the peasant brothers in other townships. The peasants in Hubian Township went to greet them.

    After the land reform, the peasants' political awareness increased. The liberated peasants in Qingping Town, Lushan County, Guizhou Province, voluntarily signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteers. The local people warmly saw off the young people who joined the army.

    西北西南中南一亿人口地区
    土地改革运动已经逐步展开
    西北区今冬明春实行土地改革的地区，土地改革运动已逐渐展开。这次实行土地改革的地区，比原计划略有增加，计有：陕西省的安康、南郑、商雒三个专区三十个县（市），关中山区三十个乡和榆林专区长城内外的新区五十六个乡，甘肃省的六十五个县（市），宁夏省的十二个县（市），和青海省的六个县（市）。以上共六千零一十三个乡，人口约一千五百四十多万。
    参加这次土地改革工作的干部共有三万多人。在运动开展以前，各地已有二百多个乡试办了土地改革。现在，土地改革运动正由这二百个乡逐渐展开，预计明年春节以前，将有三千个乡完成分配土地的工作，明年五月前六千多个乡就可全部结束。这次土地改革完成后，陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省，除甘肃省玉门关以西地区，甘肃、宁夏、青海三省蒙、藏人民聚居地区，和青海省正实行减租的六个县以外，四省农业地区的土地改革就可全部完成。
    西北这次实行土地改革的地区，包括一部分回汉杂居的农村和回民农村。一年来，各地回族农民要求实行土地改革很迫切。在过去的减租运动中，这些回汉杂居的农村和回民农村都已实行了减租，农民觉悟提高，参加农民协会的很多。在过去的各项农村工作中，人民政府都正确地执行了民族政策，提拔和培养了大批回族干部，并加强了回汉人民的团结。今年，西北宣布实行土地改革的地区后，各地回民无不热烈拥护。（新华社）
    西南区第三期土地改革运动已于十月间开始。这一期实行土地改革的地区计有：川东区铜梁、永川等十四个整县，和武隆、石柱等五县的各一部分；川西区新都、华阳等三十二县的各一部分；川南区简阳、内江等二十五县的各一部分，和泸州、自贡、五通桥三市郊区的各一部分；川北区宣汉、通江等十五个整县，和巴中县的一部分；云南省昭通等三十九个整县，和宣威等二十二县的各一部分；贵州省雷山、普安等二十三个整县，和惠水、镇远等三十五县的各一部分；西康省盐源、盐边等四个整县，和越嶲等两县的各一部分。以上九十五个整县，一百二十二县和三个市郊区的各一部分，农业人口共三千八百余万。这些地区的土地改革将于今冬明春两季内完成。
    这一期土地改革完成后，四川地区和西康省汉人地区的土地改革就基本完成了，贵州省将有百分之八十九的地区完成土地改革，云南省将有百分之四十五以上的地区大体完成土地改革。为发动第三期土地改革运动，西南军政委员会土地改革委员会和各地人民政府、各地中国共产党领导机关，都曾认真地总结第二期土地改革的经验，并训练了参加土地改革的干部七万人（包括各地大学、中学师生和参加土地改革工作的民主人士）。（新华社）
    中南区今冬明春要在五千万人口的地区进行土地改革运动，在六千万人口的地区进行土地改革复查。目前，各地正在积极进行土地改革和土地改革复查的准备工作。
    中南区农民经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革等运动后，政治觉悟逐步提高，大批干部都已受到多次锻炼；地主阶级已受到严重打击，发生了新的分化。这是中南区今冬明春进行土地改革和土地改革复查的有利条件。但是，在有些群众工作基础薄弱、农民发动不充分、未进行土地改革的地区，农民群众虽急于要求分田，而他们的政治觉悟和组织性都还很差，农村基层组织还存在着不同程度的不纯现象。在已实行土地改革的地区，按土地改革工作完成的情况来说，又有基本彻底、比较彻底和不彻底三种类型的乡存在。其中第一类乡比例小，而且还有一些遗留问题。但是有不少农村工作干部和农民群众因胜利而发生麻痹松懈思想。因此，地主阶级就乘机破坏。在退租退押、反恶霸和土地改革不彻底的地区，地主阶级的破坏活动就更加嚣张。针对这一情况，中南区各省人民政府和中共党委从八月份以来，相继总结了过去农民运动工作，布置了今冬明春土地改革和土地改革的复查工作。各省人民政府和中共党委，都根据具体情况确定了今冬明春进行土地改革和复查的步骤，强调充分做好准备工作继续放手发动群众和深入彻底完成土地改革，并坚持土地改革必须按清剿土匪反恶霸、退租退押，划阶级、没收征收，分配、复查等三个阶段来进行。之后，各省就积极进行各项准备工作。有些省召开了各界人民代表会。到八月初止，江西全省已训练干部一万四千人，河南省淮阳专区已训练干部六千八百多人。湖北省荆州专区所属京山等县，七月到九月训练干部二千零四十四人，另外还培养了乡村干部、农民积极分子四万八千一百四十六人。广西省各县也集中训练了县区干部。各地的训练内容，主要是通过总结工作，肯定成绩和好的工作方法，批判某些干部的麻痹松懈思想，并根据当前农村情况，研究今后怎样贯彻土地改革政策。广西省许多县的人民政府在训练干部时，注意引导一些新参加工作的知识分子干部认识地主阶级的罪恶和农民的痛苦，同时检查和批判自己的错误思想，很有成效。针对干部和农民群众的麻痹松懈思想，中南区各地人民政府和中共党委注意了思想教育工作。例如新湖南报曾开展关于
    “李四喜思想”的讨论批判，河南日报、江西日报、湖北日报、湖北农民报也曾相继以雷玉、王水盛、王承英、李太明等作为典型，展开思想批判。这些教育工作都得到显著效果。
    为了创造经验，训练干部，中南区各省都先后进行了土地改革和复查的重点实验。河南省三十多个县的重点复查工作正在开展，有些地区已经结束。湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西等省不少地区的土地改革重点实验工作，有的已经结束，有的正在重点开展。广西省目前正在进行土地改革实验的有二百四十六个村。
    为了大力支援今冬明春的土地改革运动，同时也为了提高干部的革命觉悟，中南区各地人民政府都已动员大批机关工作人员下乡。中南区各地大学师生、各党派、各界人士，也都表示坚决支援农民的反封建斗争，热烈报名参加土地改革运动。
