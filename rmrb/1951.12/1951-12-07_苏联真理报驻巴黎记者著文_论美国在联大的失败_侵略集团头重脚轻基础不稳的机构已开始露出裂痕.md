Xinhua News Agency, December 4th. TASS, Moscow, December 3rd: "Pravda" today published an article by its Paris correspondent, Zhu Kov, entitled "The Defeat of the Warmongers," which analyzes the work of the Sixth UN General Assembly.

Zhu Kov said: American diplomats knew from experience that the Soviet delegation would put forward concrete proposals at the Assembly, expressing the hopes of the peoples of all countries, and aimed at preventing another world war. Therefore, they desperately tried to preempt it, at least this time. They put forward a completely false plan and included it in the agenda under the hypocritical name of "regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments."

Zhu Kov said: They hoped to confuse public opinion and paralyze public vigilance. However, American diplomats were ultimately unable to prevent a substantive discussion of the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Finding themselves unable to defend their false and hypocritical proposals in the face of the profound and well-documented refutations of the Soviet and People's Democratic countries' delegations, they were finally forced to vote in favor of the proposal by the delegations of Iraq, Pakistan and Syria to organize a subcommittee; the task of this subcommittee was to consider the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons, reduce armaments and establish the strictest international control to ensure the implementation of these measures, together with the proposals of Acheson, Eden and Schuman.

Analyzing the discussions in the United Nations, Zhu Kov said: First of all, the words and actions of the American delegation and its more loyal servants (such as the representatives of Australia) at the meeting were as if they were attending the San Francisco Conference, not the Paris meeting. In the end, besides creating an embarrassing situation for themselves, they did not gain any other benefits.

Acheson delivered a shallow, arrogant speech on the first day of the debate, wantonly slandering and attacking the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. But soon after, he realized that many things had changed in the world since his performance at the San Francisco Opera House this summer.

Zhu Kov pointed out: First, during this period, the peace camp has become stronger and its strength has increased. Second, the aggressor bloc's top-heavy, unstable structure has begun to show cracks, which could be seen at the Ottawa meeting of the Atlantic Alliance, and which were more evident at the Rome meeting. Third, the national liberation movements in the vassal states of the United States, Britain, and France are rapidly growing in scope and magnitude. Acheson was able to do whatever he wanted in the United Nations not long ago, all thanks to the votes of these vassal states. The representatives of these countries to the UN General Assembly, no matter how loyal they themselves are to the United States, have to take into account the growing national liberation movement in their own countries.

Zhu Kov said: Everyone knows that at the last UN General Assembly, despite the United States using all means of threats and pressure, twelve Arab and Asian countries began to organize a "neutral" core within the United Nations, which opposed the American policy of aggression and specifically demanded peaceful negotiations to end the Korean War. This time, the call against the policy of the American adventurers who are leading to a new world war is even louder.

Zhu Kov continued: Even within the Latin American bloc, signs of discord have appeared; the twenty votes of this bloc were originally stored in the safe of the American delegation. Representatives of Latin American countries have had to pay attention to the growing anger of the people of all countries, and therefore, they have spoken out more and more frequently against the arrogance of the imperialists.

Zhu Kov said: Understanding all this, it is not difficult to understand the difficult situation of the American delegation. At meetings of the Political Committee, delegations from various countries have repeatedly demanded to find a solution to the issue of disarmament that can be accepted by all countries, including the Soviet Union.

Zhu Kov finally said: Needless to say, the American delegation can still command everything in the United Nations. Although its mechanical majority has weakened and is about to disintegrate, this majority is still able to pass resolutions favorable to Mr. Truman and his men. But as time goes by, things will become more and more difficult. This is the general trend. More and more people around the world who support Stalin's policy of peaceful coexistence and friendship among nations; the future of the world belongs to this policy.

    苏联真理报驻巴黎记者著文
    论美国在联大的失败
    侵略集团头重脚轻基础不稳的机构已开始露出裂痕
     【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”今日登载了该报驻巴黎记者朱可夫的一篇文章，题为“战争贩子的失败”，其中分析了第六届联合国大会的工作。
    朱可夫说：美国外交家根据经验，知道苏联代表团将在大会上提出具体建议，表达各国人民的希望，并具有阻止另一次大战的目的。因此，他们就拼命设法先发制人，至少这一次是如此。他们提出了一个彻头彻尾的虚假的计划，以“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的虚伪名目列入议程。
    朱可夫说：他们希望迷惑舆论，麻痹公众的警惕性。然而美国外交家们终究不能够阻止讨论裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的实质。
    他们发现自己在苏联和人民民主国家代表团的深刻的、证据确凿的批驳之前无法为他们的虚假而伪善的提案辩护，而终于被迫投票赞成伊拉克、巴基斯坦和叙利亚代表团所提出的组织小组委员会的建议；这个小组委员会的任务是把苏联所提出的禁止原子武器、裁减军备并建立最严格的国际管制以保证实施这些措施的建议，与艾奇逊、艾登和舒曼所提出的提案一同考虑。
    朱可夫在分析联合国的讨论情况时说：首先，美国代表团和它的比较忠实的仆从们（如澳大利亚的代表们）在会上所表现的言语行动，好像不是在参加巴黎会议，而是在参加旧金山会议。结果除了造成自己的狼狈情况以外，并没有获得其他好处。
    艾奇逊在辩论的头一天就发表了浅薄、傲慢的演说，对苏联和各人民民主国家恣意诽谤攻击。但是不久以后他就了解到：自从今年夏天他在旧金山歌剧院登台表演后，世界上已有许多事情发生变化了。
    朱可夫指出：第一，在这个期间，和平阵营更壮大了，它的力量更增加了。第二，侵略集团头重脚轻、基础不稳的机构已开始露出裂痕，这种裂痕在大西洋联盟渥太华会议上已经可以看到，在罗马会议上就表现得更为显著。第三，美、英、法三国的附属国家内的民族解放运动，在范围和程度上都在迅速增长，艾奇逊不久前在联合国之所以能够为所欲为，全靠这些附属国家的投票。这些国家驻联合国大会的代表们，不管他们本人对美国是如何忠心，但都不得不考虑到他们国内民族解放运动正在增长的这个事实。
    朱可夫说：大家都知道，在上一届联合国大会上，尽管美国使用一切威胁手段，并设法使用压力，但十二个阿拉伯和亚洲国家却开始在联合国之内组织一种“中立”核心，这个核心反对美国的侵略方针，特别要求举行和平谈判来结束朝鲜战争。这一次，反对美国冒险家导向发动新世界大战的政策的呼声更响亮了。
    朱可夫接着说：甚至在拉丁美洲集团内部，也已出现不和的迹象；这个集团的二十票本来是储存在美国代表团的保险箱里的。拉丁美洲国家的代表不得不注意各国人民日益增长的愤怒，因此，他们已愈来愈频繁地发言反对帝国主义者的蛮横行为。
    朱可夫说：明了了所有这些，就不难了解美国代表团的处境为难了。在政治委员会会议上，各国代表团已接二连三地要求设法为裁减军备问题找出能为包括苏联在内的一切国家所接受的解决办法。
    朱可夫最后说：不消说，美国代表团现在仍能在联合国内指挥一切。它的机械多数虽然是削弱了，快要瓦解了，不过，这个多数现在还能够通过有利于杜鲁门先生和他手下人物的决议。但是随着时间的消逝，事情就越来越难办了。大势所趋，就是如此。世界各地拥护斯大林的各国人民和平、友好共处的政策的人越来越多了；世界的前途是属于这个政策的。
