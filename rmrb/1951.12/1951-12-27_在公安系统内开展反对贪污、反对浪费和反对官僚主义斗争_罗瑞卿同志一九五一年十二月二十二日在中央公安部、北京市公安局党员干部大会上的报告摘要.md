Comrades:

    Today we are holding this meeting of Party member cadres because we want to mobilize the broad masses to launch a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. To achieve this goal, we must first clarify the ideological issues related to this struggle among Party member cadres so that this struggle can be victoriously launched and completed.

    Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the call for "Increase production and practice thrift" and "Oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy," many places across the country have successively launched large-scale and serious struggles against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Judging from the materials from many places, the phenomena of corruption, extravagance, and bureaucracy are indeed very serious. Therefore, to thoroughly overcome these phenomena, we must launch a struggle as large as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and we must launch a broad and profound mass movement to carry this struggle through to the end; only then can we thoroughly eliminate the residual influence of the past reactionary rulers and resist the bourgeoisie's encroachment upon and influence on our Party. This struggle has already achieved great results in the Northeast and other places where it was launched earlier: it has severely cracked down on various corrupt behaviors; eliminated various bad phenomena of extravagance and waste; and exposed various forms of bureaucracy in our work. As a result, this struggle has not only greatly reduced the expenditures of state organs but also greatly enhanced the political consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and strengthened our work in all aspects.

    Our people's public security organs are one of the important pillars of the people's democratic dictatorship, a power organ for safeguarding national interests and the interests of the people, and one of the important links between the Party and the people's government and the broad masses of the people. Therefore, we must stand at the forefront of this struggle, vigorously and swiftly eliminate the erroneous tendencies and criminal behaviors existing within our organs and among some public security personnel. That is to say, we must thoroughly eliminate the influence of all exploitative classes' selfish ideologies on us and the influence of Kuomintang style on us in the struggle against corruption and waste, and against bureaucracy. Our people's public security organs must always ensure that they are the people's loyal servants and prevent and overcome the tendency of public security personnel to become detached from the masses with a serious and resolute attitude; and the serious phenomena of corruption, violation of laws and discipline by some public security personnel are a concentrated manifestation of this tendency at the present time. This is the fundamental reason why we must carry out this struggle so resolutely.

    Within our people's public security organs, why can the phenomena of corruption, extravagance, and waste exist and grow so seriously? What is the basic reason?

    First, within our public security organs, especially within the public security bureaus of large and medium-sized cities, there are a large number of former Kuomintang police officers and former police elements. These people are stained with the strong bad habits and styles of the old ruling class, and therefore, they have brought us the encroachment and influence of hostile classes, damaging the political health and purity of our people's public security organs. Many of them have accepted a lot of revolutionary education and transformation and have made some progress; and some of them have fundamentally changed and truly become revolutionary public security personnel. However, some others among them, due to being too deeply influenced by the old ruling class, are habitually corrupt and even degenerate to an incorrigible degree. They adopt a double-dealing approach towards us, pretending to be progressive in an attempt to win our trust. They say they will not be corrupt or do bad things in front of us, but they still engage in corruption and bad deeds behind our backs. They come up with many ways to extort and blackmail the people, just like in the past. Some of them reflect during the day but still do bad things at night. These people's corrupt and degenerate roots are very difficult to eliminate at once. They do not consider corruption to be shameful but rather think it is a sign that they have the means and the ability. In order to cover up their crimes, they not only engage in corruption themselves but also entice others to do so. Some of our cadres and personnel with weak wills accept their enticement and are dragged down.

    Second, the national bourgeoisie are our friends in the people's democratic united front. The proletariat and its party must adhere to the policy of unity towards all industrialists and businessmen who abide by the Common Program and government decrees, but at the same time, they must resist all the wrong things coming from the bourgeoisie. In particular, behaviors that violate government decrees and the influence of corrupt habits must be firmly resisted. Only in this way can we avoid being corrupted and maintain the high purity of the proletariat and its party. However, the influence of these corrupt habits is still very large and can be encountered everywhere. It still has a great temptation for some people with weak wills. Among the bourgeoisie, there are also some unscrupulous merchants who, in order to achieve their selfish goals of smuggling, evading taxes, engaging in illegal businesses, and defrauding state assets, even plan to bribe some of our cadres and entice them to fall into the trap. This is also an important reason why some people fall into the quagmire of corruption and cannot extricate themselves.

    Third, we have a large number of new personnel who have joined the work, many of whom are pure and trustworthy, and even if they have some shortcomings, they are easy to correct. However, there are also some who come from landlord and bourgeois families. They have already been somewhat infected by the bad habits of the landlord and bourgeois classes, and therefore, they have brought a fairly strong exploitative class ideology and style. In addition, they have not undergone very good transformation, so they fall into the quagmire of corruption under the influence and enticement of the old personnel and the bourgeoisie.

    Fourth, there is a small group of Party members within our Party who have weak wills and have degenerated and deteriorated politically and ideologically. Some of them were good cadres in the past, but they are immersed in pride, complacency, and a lack of desire for progress politically. They do not think that the national victory is "just like finishing the first step of the Long March," but rather think that the revolution has ended. They have forgotten Chairman Mao's instructions at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party not long ago, only two years and eight months before: "Because of victory, pride, complacency, stagnation, a reluctance to make progress, and a desire for enjoyment and aversion to continued hard living may grow within the Party. Because of victory, the people are grateful to us, and the bourgeoisie will also come out to offer flattery. It has been proved that the enemy cannot conquer us. The bourgeoisie’s flattery, however, may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks. There may be some Communists, who were not conquered by enemies with guns and were worthy of the name of heroes in the face of these enemies, but who cannot withstand sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated by sugar-coated bullets." Those who have been defeated by sugar-coated bullets are the targets of enticement and corruption by the bourgeoisie and the remaining reactionary forces. The collusion between illegal bourgeois elements and these degenerated elements is the content and essence of many corruption cases.

    However, comrades, the above four points are only one aspect of the reasons why corruption, extravagance, and waste can exist and grow in our public security system. On the other hand, and more importantly, it is inseparable from the serious bureaucratic style in our leadership. With the national victory, public security agencies at all levels have been established for almost three years, but we do not know much about the above-mentioned serious phenomena; we know some of them, but due to ideological paralysis, we have not taken effective measures to resolutely sanction and deal with them. The leadership of the Central Public Security Ministry has a certain degree of vigilance about the above situation, and has made some criticisms and struggles against some phenomena of corruption and waste. However, this criticism and struggle is far from being profound and forceful enough. We have not deeply understood Chairman Mao's instructions at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, so we have not been able to universally and systematically examine the already discovered erroneous tendencies, and punish those corrupt elements who must be punished. We have not earnestly mobilized the masses to launch a vigorous and resolute struggle against the phenomena of corruption and waste, so we have not solved many problems. As for the leadership of people's public security organs at all levels across the country, their vigilance against this erroneous tendency may be better than that of the Central Public Security Ministry in some cases, but mostly it is worse. Some leading organs or leading comrades not only did not prevent the occurrence of erroneous tendencies such as corruption and waste, but also did not check or investigate them after these tendencies occurred, and adopted a bad attitude of appeasement, tolerance, or even indulgence. Some people who "harm the public interest for personal gain" and engage in corruption and waste have received support from responsible personnel in one way or another. As everyone knows, if the bureaucracy in our leadership is not overcome, the situation of corruption, extravagance, and waste will never stop. Therefore, while carrying out the struggle against corruption and waste, we must resolutely launch a struggle against bureaucracy. In addition, bureaucracy has many other manifestations. For example, some people are high above, do not inspect work, do not investigate and analyze the situation, do not proceed from reality, but rely solely on imagination or false reports from some subordinates, and neither raise problems nor solve them, and are satisfied with empty so-called principled leadership. Our documentalism is also very serious. Some official documents travel through eleven handling units (departments, bureaus, divisions, sections, etc.), are reviewed and handled by twelve people (directors, bureau chiefs, division chiefs, section chiefs, clerks, staff members, etc.), go through thirty-six receiving and dispatching procedures, and take sixty-three days to resolve a small matter. The abuse of forms is also very serious. For example, the Central Public Security Ministry issued a total of forty kinds of forms in the past year that required the lower levels to fill out. When they reached the East China Public Security Department and the Shandong Provincial Public Security Department, they expanded to eighty-eight kinds, and when they reached the Changwei Prefectural Public Security Office, they ballooned to one hundred and thirty kinds. Of course, the lower levels cannot implement them. It should be said that the lower-level organs' attitude of rejecting this bureaucracy, documentalism, and formalism, and adopting an attitude of ignoring it is completely justifiable. This struggle must also settle and overcome the manifestations of bureaucracy in this regard, in order to improve the quality of our work and improve the efficiency of solving problems. But the most important thing at present is to overcome the bureaucratic tendencies in the anti-corruption and anti-waste phenomena.

    Here, I should also talk about the issue of political leadership and ideological leadership. Some of our public security leading organs or leading comrades not only have too weak political leadership but also have a tendency to neglect politics and not ask about politics. Those who neglect politics and do not ask about politics are either bureaucrats or pragmatists. In many links of our national public security system, there are such bureaucrats and pragmatists. In the places they lead, the atmosphere of political principles is very thin, and the life of the Party is also very unsound. It should be pointed out that within our public security system, there are still a large number of retained personnel who have not been thoroughly reformed, and some petty-bourgeois elements within our Party whose thinking has not been thoroughly reformed. It is not in all aspects that the Communist Party influences them and leads them, but in some aspects, they are still influencing the Communist Party members and influencing our style. Or both influences exist at the same time, coexisting peacefully, "non-aggression." Therefore, in many aspects, the ideological boundaries are not clear, and the political right and wrong are not understood. This is a dangerous phenomenon, and therefore it is an intolerable phenomenon. The reason why corruption can occur on a large scale in our public security system and has not been greatly hindered and cracked down on is a fundamental reason. We have repeatedly said that in the public security system, we must emphasize politics, Party members must emphasize Party spirit, emphasize the education of Marxism-Leninism, and emphasize the education of Mao Zedong Thought. We must strictly place the ideology and work of the public security department under the leadership of the proletariat, that is, the Communist Party, and must overcome all reactionary influences from hostile classes and all other aspects of ideological encroachment and influence that are not conducive to the people. I have indeed said a lot about this point. Some comrades present here may have heard it several times, but I still want to repeat it today.

    How do we launch and conduct this struggle?

    First, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, launch a mass democratic movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy within the organs, so that the broad masses of cadres and personnel both inside and outside the Party thoroughly realize that corruption is illegal and shameful, and extravagance and waste are also illegal and shameful. Both are affected and corrupted by the exploitative class's selfish ideology. It is necessary to refute all excuses for engaging in corruption and waste, and to draw a clear line between all comrades and corrupt elements. Create a serious political atmosphere and strong public opinion in our public security system against corruption and extravagance, so that corrupt elements and extravagant and wasteful behaviors have nowhere to hide.

    Second, the launch of this movement must be the responsibility of the top leaders, who must lead it personally, mobilize the entire Party, mobilize the masses, promote democracy and mutual inspection, and organize economy inspection committees and inspection teams, so that the struggle against corruption and waste becomes a widespread and profound mass movement. All personnel should be called upon to boldly report and expose, report all corrupt elements, and expose the bad styles of extravagance, waste, and bureaucracy. On the one hand, it is necessary to oppose liberalism and oppose those who know that something is wrong but do not come out to report it, or who still adopt an attitude of "minding their own business" even though they know something is wrong. On the other hand, it is necessary to oppose suppressing democracy, and anyone who dares to suppress the masses' reports and the democratic movement among the masses must be severely sanctioned. At the same time, it is necessary to call on those who have corruption and waste errors or crimes to confess voluntarily. Anyone who confesses voluntarily can be given a lighter sentence or a lighter punishment. We must concentrate our efforts to crack down on corrupt elements, especially major embezzlers, but we must never relax the struggle against extravagant and wasteful behaviors, especially those waste caused by dereliction of duty due to bureaucracy or irresponsibility, and especially the phenomenon of waste caused by abusing one's power solely for personal enjoyment, which must be struggled against. Because this kind of so-called waste is essentially corruption, or at least very close to corruption.

    Third, all public security organs, especially urban public security organs, must also boldly mobilize the people from all walks of life in society to report and expose, in order to thoroughly expose the extortion, violation of laws and discipline, bribery, kickbacks, false accounts, acceptance of gifts from merchants, helping merchants smuggle and evade taxes, engaging in illegal businesses, colluding with merchants to do business, taking shares, etc. of public security personnel, police personnel, or other staff members. It is impossible to make the movement thorough with internal democratic movement alone without the reports and exposures of the broad masses of the people.

    Fourth, serious attitude must be taken to punish those who have been reported and exposed to have solid evidence of corruption, bribery, extortion, and violation of laws and discipline. The punishment should be determined specifically according to the amount of corruption, the severity of the crime, voluntary confession or exposure by others, and other circumstances. Major corruption, or the release and shielding of counter-revolutionary elements due to bribery, which has seriously damaged the interests of the state, or the causing of great losses to the people due to extortion, must be severely punished, even to the point of execution. Medium and small corrupt elements should be given lighter criminal and administrative penalties or given criticism and education after confessing and repenting, but they must not commit the crime again. If they commit the crime again, they must be severely punished. Those who are reported and exposed by others and firmly refuse to confess should also be severely punished.

    Fifth, in the movement, with the criticism and exposure of extravagance, waste, and bureaucratic style, we should also start to improve our work system and establish our new style at the same time. In terms of streamlining and saving, things that can be done or not can definitely not be done; institutions that can be set up or not can definitely not be set up; personnel that can be used or not can definitely not be used; and all expenses that can be saved must be saved. And a mass movement of saving should be launched under the conditions of not harming health and not hindering work. In terms of the work system, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of work, strengthen investigation and research, go deep into the lower levels, strengthen inspection, overcome blindness and bureaucratic style, and earnestly review and "revolutionize" the unreasonable work system, cumbersome procedures, and documentalism that exist in the current work. Only in this way can we improve the quality of work and the efficiency of work. In terms of lifestyle and work style, it is necessary to cultivate a pragmatic work style and a hardworking and simple lifestyle. The state's financial system and the principles of streamlining institutions must be resolutely implemented. It is inappropriate, wrong, and must be strictly corrected to try to catch up with the bourgeois lifestyle, not starting from the life of the working people; to compete for "generosity" and "grandeur", not considering the long-term interests of the country, harming the public interest for personal gain; not paying attention to improving the work ability of cadres, but blindly demanding to increase staffing; and arbitrarily making extra expenditures outside the supply standards of the state financial system.

    Sixth, in the struggle against corruption, attention should be paid to grasping the following key points. According to the current situation, the first key point should be the sub-bureaus and police stations of urban public security bureaus, especially the police personnel in them. The second is the personnel in the investigation work departments, especially those who are engaged in secret investigation work and those who have business expenses in their hands, or those who have many convenient conditions to use to do bad things. The third is some personnel in the prison management and labor reform departments, because these personnel also have many convenient conditions for corruption and bribery if they want to do bad things. The fourth is the personnel of the border defense organs, mainly those in the border defense bureaus, sub-bureaus, and police stations in the border areas. They have power, and they are one of the important targets for unscrupulous merchants to entice and buy off, and they are also a place that the enemy pays close attention to. We already know that some border defense organs in the border areas have serious phenomena of corruption and bribery. The fifth is the personnel of administrative, affairs, general affairs, production, and other units. Some personnel in these units are the closest to money and materials, and they are also the most easily affected, encroached, and corrupted by unscrupulous merchants. Judging from the existing materials, the phenomenon of corruption of some personnel in the administrative affairs departments is also extremely serious.

    In order to make this movement develop rapidly and deeply, it is also necessary to break through some ideological obstacles:

    In the public security system, will openly, swiftly, and vigorously carrying out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and openly exposing and criticizing some bad phenomena within the public security organs, lower our prestige? Our answer is: No. The Tianjin Public Security Bureau's open handling of the Feng Jingquan infringement of human rights incident is the most obvious example. Only those who dare not openly admit their mistakes in front of the people, and dare not earnestly examine and correct their mistakes, will the people distrust them, and thus truly lose their prestige. Stalin said: "It is said that victors should not be judged, criticized, or inspected. This is not right. Victors can and must be judged, criticized, and inspected. This is not only beneficial to the cause, but also beneficial to the victors themselves: then they will be less proud and more humble... If our Communist Party is afraid of criticism and inspection, then it will not be of much value..." Chairman Mao said that Chinese Communists "are always ready to give up their lives for our cause, do we still have any erroneous ideas, viewpoints, opinions, or methods that are not suitable for the needs of the people and are reluctant to discard? Do we still welcome any political dust or political microorganisms to contaminate our clean faces and corrode our healthy bodies? ...Do we still have any personal interests or mistakes or shortcomings that cannot be sacrificed?" Comrades! If we want to be responsible for the cause of the people, we must dare to admit and correct our mistakes in front of the people, and admit and correct our mistakes under the supervision of the people. Only those who do not give priority to the cause of the people but give priority to personal interests are unwilling or dare not to expose and criticize their shortcomings and mistakes, but such people will definitely be spurned by the people.

    In the public security system, will launching the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy affect the current central work of thoroughly eliminating counter-revolutionaries? Our answer is also that it will not affect it. Because if corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are thoroughly defeated, it will only be conducive to implementing and strengthening the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. For example, the Tianjin First Sub-bureau has serious corruption and bribery, to the point of shielding and releasing counter-revolutionary elements. If it is not thoroughly rectified and allowed to develop, will our sub-bureau not deteriorate? How can we talk about thoroughly suppressing counter-revolutionaries?

    Comrades, my report is coming to an end. But I would like to ask everyone to recognize that if the tendency of corruption is allowed to exist and develop in our public security system, and we do not oppose, criticize, or stop this tendency, and do not punish corrupt elements, then where does its danger lie? In terms of the overall situation, Chairman Mao once said that if the tendency of corruption is not stopped or overcome, there is a danger of the Party and the country perishing. This of course applies to us as well. In terms of the specific situation: If the public security system has a serious tendency of corruption, and there are a large number of corrupt elements, where does its danger lie? Its danger lies in the fact that if this is the case, it may cause our people's public security organs to become detached from the people, or even endanger the people; it may give the enemy a great gap, allowing the enemy to sneak into our interior and sabotage from within, causing us to be defeated in front of the enemy.

    Why do we say this? What is the basis for saying this?

    As everyone knows: If the people's public security organs have a serious tendency of corruption, it is impossible not to arouse the opposition of the people. In fact, this is the case now. The people are full of praise for our resolute suppression of counter-revolutionary elements; but they are very dissatisfied with the corruption of some of our public security personnel and police personnel, and even their extortion from the people. Everyone can also imagine: A public security personnel or police personnel uses the power in his hand to extort from the people. Does this play a role in protecting the people? Or does it play a role in harming the people? As for those who collude with unscrupulous merchants, or even collude with counter-revolutionary elements, accepting bribes and engaging in corruption, on the surface it seems that no money has been squeezed out of the people, but the interests of the state and the interests of the people have suffered unknown losses. Does this still need to be explained further?

    In addition, our enemies are always watching us with wide eyes, watching all the weaknesses inside our people's public security organs, looking for all the gaps that can be sneaked in, in order to give us a fatal blow. If there is a serious tendency of corruption and serious bureaucracy in our public security system, will our enemies not seize on these and use them? Are our enemies all lazy people, all fools, or all asleep? No, comrades! They are not asleep or lazy in opposing the people, opposing the revolution, and opposing the Communist Party. They have tried every means to entice our personnel to be corrupted, so that after being corrupted, they are forced to serve them. Are there few such examples, whether in China or abroad? This spring, in one of our local public security organs, two senior cadres at the time brought a large number of Chinese and foreign special agents into our interior due to their corruption, which caused us great harm. If it hadn't been discovered early and resolute measures had been taken, it is not known how much harm it would have caused us! Think about it, how can those corrupt elements and degenerated elements guarantee that they will not fall into the enemy's trap?

    If some of our public security organs are essentially playing a role in harming the people due to the corruption of some of their personnel; if some of our public security organs have brought counter-revolutionary elements into our interior due to the corruption of some of their personnel, then think about what the result will be? Can such a public security organ still be one of the important pillars of the people's democratic dictatorship? Can it still belong to the people and be used to defeat the enemy and protect the people?

    Therefore, the tendency of corruption cannot be allowed to exist in the public security system, and corrupt elements, especially major embezzlers, must be severely punished. Is this not clear enough?

    Comrades, let us unite, let all the personnel of our national public security system unite, concentrate our firepower, and follow Chairman Mao's instructions to fire on corruption, fire on degeneration, fire on extravagance, fire on bureaucracy, and be sure to carry this great struggle through to the end!

    在公安系统内开展反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义斗争
    ——罗瑞卿同志一九五一年十二月二十二日在中央公安部、北京市公安局党员干部大会上的报告摘要同志们：
    今天我们召开党员干部大会，是因为要动员广大群众开展一个反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的斗争。为此目的，就必须首先在党员干部中把有关这一斗争的思想问题弄清楚，才能使这一斗争胜利的开展和完成。
    自从党中央和毛主席提出：“增加生产、厉行节约”和“反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义”的号召以来，全国许多地方，已经陆续展开了大规模的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的严重斗争。从许多地方的材料来看，贪污腐化、铺张浪费和官僚主义的现象，确实是十分严重的。因此，要彻底克服这些现象，必须发动一场同镇压反革命一样的大斗争，必须发动一个广泛而又深刻的群众运动，才能把这场斗争进行到底；才能彻底扫除过去的反动统治者的残余影响和反对资产阶级对于我们党的侵蚀和影响。这个斗争在东北和其他开展得较早的地方，已经收到了很大的效果：严重地打击了各种贪污腐化的行为；清除了各种铺张浪费的恶劣现象；揭发了我们工作中各式各样的官僚主义；因而这个斗争的结果，不仅大大紧缩了国家机关的开支，而且大大提高了干部、群众的政治觉悟和革命积极性，加强了我们各方面的工作。
    我们人民公安机关是人民民主专政的重要支柱之一，是保卫国家利益和保卫人民利益的权力机关，是党和人民政府联系广大人民群众的重要纽带之一。因此，我们必须站在这个斗争的前面，大张旗鼓地雷厉风行地肃清我们机关内部和一部分公安工作人员中存在着的错误倾向和犯罪行为。这就是说：我们必须在反对贪污浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争中，彻底肃清一切剥削阶级损人利己思想对于我们的侵蚀和影响，肃清国民党作风对于我们的侵蚀和影响。我们人民公安机关，任何时候都必须保证自己是人民的忠实的勤务员，并以严肃的坚决的态度，来防止和克服公安人员中的脱离群众的倾向；而若干公安人员贪污腐化、违法乱纪的严重现象，则是目前时期这种倾向的集中表现。这就是我们之所以必须这样坚决地来进行这一斗争的根本理由。
    在我们人民公安机关内，贪污腐化和铺张浪费现象，为什么能够这样严重的存在和滋长呢？其基本原因是什么呢？
    第一、在我们公安机关内部，特别在大、中城市的公安局内部，有大批的原国民党警察机关的旧人员和旧警察成份。这些人的身上，沾染着浓厚的旧统治阶级的恶习和作风，因此，也就给我们带来了敌对阶级的侵蚀和影响，损害着我们人民公安机关政治上的健康和纯洁。他们中间，有不少人已经接受了不少的革命教育和改造，有了一些进步；并且有一些人已经有了根本的改变，真正变成了革命的公安人员，但是，他们中间的另一些人，则由于受旧统治阶级影响太深，贪污成性，甚至腐化堕落到无可救药的地步。他们对我们采取两面手法，伪装进步，企图骗取我们的信任。他们当面说不贪污、不作坏事了，背后却依然贪污和作坏事。他们像过去一样，想出许多办法，敲诈、勒索人民。他们有的白天反省，夜里还是照样办坏事。这些人的贪污腐化的劣根性，是很难于一下肃清的。他们并不以贪污为可耻，反以为这是表示他们有办法有本事。为了掩盖自己的罪行，他们不仅自己贪污，还勾引别人贪污。我们有一些意志薄弱的干部和人员，就接受了他们的勾引，被他们拖下水去。
    第二、民族资产阶级是我们人民民主统一战线中的朋友，无产阶级及其政党对于一切遵守共同纲领和政府法令的工商业者，必须坚持团结方针，但同时，必须抵抗来自资产阶级的一切错误的东西。特别是违犯政府法令的行为和腐化习气的影响，更必须予以坚决的抵抗。这样才不致受到腐蚀，才能保持无产阶级及其政党的高度纯洁性。可是，这种腐化习气的影响，还是很大，还是到处都可以碰到的。对于一些意志薄弱的人，它还有很大的引诱力。在资产阶级中，还有一部分奸商，为了达到他们走私漏税、经营非法买卖、骗取国家资财的自私自利的目的，竟至有计划地向我们若干干部行贿，勾引他们上当，这也是若干人堕入腐化泥坑而不能自拔的一个重要原因。
    第三、我们内部有大批新参加工作的人员，其中很多都是纯洁的，可以信任的，即使有一点毛病，也是容易改好的。但也有一些出身于地主、资产阶级家庭的人，他们对于地主、资产阶级的恶劣习气，已经有了一些习染，因而也就带来了相当浓厚的剥削阶级的思想和作风；再加上还没有经过很好的改造，因此，他们在旧人员和资产阶级的影响和引诱面前，也就堕入了贪污腐化的泥坑。
    第四、我们党内有一小批意志薄弱、政治上思想上堕落蜕化的分子，他们之中有的过去还是好干部，但是他们沉醉在骄傲居功和政治上不求进步的情绪中，他们不认为全国胜利“只不过像万里长征走完了第一步”，而是认为革命已经完结了。他们忘记了还过去不久，即只在两年零八个月以前，毛主席在党的二中全会上的指示：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者，可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”这些在糖弹面前打了败仗的人，就是资产阶级和残余的反动势力引诱、腐化的对象。不法的资产阶级分子和这些堕落蜕化的分子相勾结，就是许多贪污案件的内容和实质。
    但是，同志们，以上四条仅是贪污腐化、铺张浪费在我们公安系统中得以存在和滋长的一个方面的原因，而另一方面，也是更加重要的原因，则是和我们领导上的严重的官僚主义作风分不开的。随着全国的胜利，各级公安机构已经建立快三年了，但是对于上述的严重现象，我们是不大了解的；其中有一些我们是了解的，但由于思想上的麻痹，也没有采取有力的措施，加以坚决地制裁和处理。中央公安部领导方面对于上面这些情况，是有一定程度的警惕的，对于若干贪污浪费现象，也作过一些批评和斗争，但是，这种批评和斗争，远远不够深刻有力。我们没有深刻体会二中全会时毛主席的指示，因此，对于已经发现的错误倾向，就没有能够普遍地系统地加以检查，并惩办那些必须惩办的贪污分子。我们没有认真地动员群众，大张旗鼓地向贪污浪费现象进行坚决的斗争，因而就没有解决了多少问题。至于全国各地各级人民公安机关的领导方面，对于这种错误倾向的警惕，有的可能比中央公安部好一些，但多半比中央公安部还差一些。有些领导机关或者领导同志，不仅没有预防贪污、浪费等错误倾向的发生，而且在这些倾向发生之后，也是不加检查，不加追究，采取了姑息、容忍、甚至放纵的恶劣态度。有些“损大公肥小公”并从中实行贪污浪费的人，有形无形地得到负责人员的支持。大家知道，如果我们领导上的官僚主义不加克服，贪污腐化、铺张浪费的情况，也就永远不会停止。因此，在开展反对贪污、反对浪费的同时，必须坚决展开反对官僚主义的斗争。此外，官僚主义还有许多表现形态，例如，有些人高高在上，不检查工作，不调查分析情况，不从实际出发，专凭想像或从某些下级人员的假报告出发，既不提出问题，也不解决问题，满足于空空洞洞的所谓原则领导。我们的文牍主义也很厉害，有的公文旅行十一个承办单位（厅、局、处、科等），经过十二个人批办（主任、局长、处长、科长、科员、办事员等），经过三十六道收发手续，历时六十三天，才算解决了一件小事。滥发表格的事也很严重。例如，中央公安部一年来共发出要求下面填报的表格四十种，到了华东公安部和山东省公安厅，就扩大到八十八种，到了昌潍专区公安处，就膨胀到一百三十种，下面当然不能执行。应当说：下级机关对于这种官僚主义、文牍主义、表格主义采取拒绝的态度，采取置之不理的态度，是完全应该批准的。这次斗争，对于官僚主义在这方面的表现，亦必须加以清算和克服，以便提高我们工作的质量和提高解决问题的效率。但目前最主要的是克服反贪污、反浪费现象中的官僚主义倾向。
    在这里，我还应该说到政治领导和思想领导的问题。我们有一些公安领导机关或者领导同志，不仅政治领导太弱，而且存在忽略政治、不问政治的倾向。这些忽略政治、不问政治的人，如果不是一个官僚主义者，便是一个事务主义者。我们全国公安系统的许多环节上，是存在着这种官僚主义者和事务主义者的。在他们领导的地方，政治原则空气是十分稀薄的，党的生活也是很不健全的。应当指出：我们公安系统内，还有大批没有经过彻底改造的留用人员，我们的党内还有一些思想没有经过彻底改造的小资产阶级分子，不是在所有方面，都是共产党影响他们，领导他们，而是在某些方面，他们还在影响共产党员，影响我们的作风。或者两种影响同时存在，和平共居，“互不侵犯”。因而在许多方面，思想上的界限是不清楚的，政治上的是非是不明白的。这是一种危险的现象，因而也就是一个不能容忍的现象。贪污腐化在我们公安系统内所以能够大量发生，所以没有受到大的阻碍和打击，这乃是一个带根本性质的原因。我们曾再三再四地说：在公安系统内必须强调政治，党员必须强调党性，强调马克思、列宁主义的教育，强调毛泽东思想的教育，必须把公安部门的思想、工作严格放在无产阶级即共产党的领导之下，必须战胜一切来自敌对阶级的反动影响和其他一切方面不利于人民的思想的侵蚀和影响。这一点我的确说的很多了，在座的有些同志，也许听过了好几次，但是我今天还是要重复地再说一遍。
    我们怎样来开展和进行这个斗争呢？
    第一、按照中央的指示在机关内开展一个群众性的反贪污、反浪费和反官僚主义的民主运动，使我们党内党外的广大干部和人员，都彻底认识：贪污腐化是犯法的，可耻的，铺张浪费也是犯法的，可耻的。这两者都是受了剥削阶级损人利己思想的影响和腐蚀。要驳斥一切进行贪污浪费的藉口，要使所有同志和贪污腐化分子划清界限。在我们的公安系统内，造成反对贪污腐化、反对铺张浪费的严肃的政治气氛，和强硬的群众舆论，使贪污腐化分子和铺张浪费行为没有藏匿之所。
    第二、这个运动的展开，必须是首长负责，亲自领导，全党动员，群众动员，发扬民主互相检查，组织节约检查委员会和检查小组，使反贪污反浪费的斗争，成为广泛深刻的群众运动。要号召所有人员大胆检举，大胆揭发，检举一切贪污腐化的分子，揭发铺张浪费和官僚主义的恶劣作风。在这里一方面要反对自由主义，反对那些明知不对也不出来揭发，或者明知不对仍然采取“事不关己高高挂起”的态度。另一方面，又要反对压制民主，对于一切敢于压制群众的检举和群众中的民主运动的人，都必须给予严厉的制裁。同时，要号召有贪污、浪费错误或者罪行的人自动坦白，凡是自动坦白的都可以从轻治罪或从轻处罚。我们必须集中力量打击贪污分子特别是大贪污犯，但绝不能放松对于铺张浪费行为的斗争，对于那些因官僚主义失职或者因不负责任所造成的浪费，尤其对于假借职权仅为了个人享乐所造成的浪费现象，必须进行斗争。因为这一种所谓浪费，实质上就是贪污，至少也同贪污很接近。
    第三、一切公安机关，特别是城市公安机关，还必须放手发动社会上的各界人民群众进行检举和揭发，以便彻底暴露公安人员、警察人员或其他工作人员中的敲诈勒索、违法乱纪、收受贿赂、吃回扣、报假账、收受商人礼物、帮助商人走私漏税、经营非法买卖、和商人勾结作生意、吃好汉股等等的贪污行为。光有内部的民主运动，没有广大人民群众的检举和揭发，也是不可能把运动搞彻底的。
    第四、对于检举和揭发出来的证据确凿的贪污受贿、敲诈勒索、违法乱纪的分子，必须采取严肃态度，加以惩办。应分别贪污大小，罪恶轻重，自动坦白或别人揭发等情况具体处理。大贪污，或因受贿而放走、包庇反革命分子，以致严重地损害了国家利益的，或因敲诈勒索以致使人民遭受很大损失的，都须要严加惩办，直至枪决。中小贪污分子坦白反省以后，则给以比较轻一点的刑事、行政处罚或给以批评教育，但以后不得再犯，再犯时必严加惩处。经过别人检举、揭发坚决不坦白的，亦应从严惩处。
    第五、在运动中，应随着对于铺张浪费和官僚主义作风的批判和揭发，同时就应当着手改进我们的工作制度，建立我们的新的作风。就精简节约来说，凡是可办可不办的事情，一定不办；可设可不设的机构，一定不设；可用可不用的人员，一定不用；凡是可以省的经费，一定要省；并在不损害健康，不妨碍工作的条件下，发动一个广大群众性的节约运动。就工作制度来说，必须加强工作的计划性，加强调查研究，深入下层，加强检查，克服盲目性和事务主义作风，切实审查并“革”掉目前工作中存在的不合理的工作制度、繁冗手续和文牍主义，只有如此，才能提高工作质量和工作效率。就生活作风和工作作风来说，必须养成实事求是的工作作风和艰苦朴素的生活作风。对于国家的财政制度和精简机构的原则，必须坚决执行。那种企图向资产阶级生活看齐，不从劳动人民生活出发；企图向“阔绰”“大方”比赛，不为国家长远利益打算，损大公肥小公；不注意提高干部工作能力，一味要求增加编制；随意在国家财政制度供给标准之外，额外开支的现象，都是不妥当的，错误的，必须严加纠正。
    第六、在反对贪污腐化的斗争中，应当注意掌握以下几个重点。根据目前情况看，第一个重点应该是城市公安局的分局、派出所，特别是其中的警察人员。其次是侦察工作部门的人员，特别是那些从事秘密侦察工作和那些手上掌握有事业费，或者要作坏事有很多便利条件可资利用的人员。第三是监狱管理和劳动改造部门中的某些人员，因为这些人员中如果要作坏事，也有许多贪污受贿的便利条件。第四是边防机关的人员，主要是那些在边疆地带的边防局、分局、派出所中的人员，他们手里有权，他们是不法商人引诱收买的重要对象之一，也是敌人非常注意的地方。我们已经知道边疆地带的某些边防机关，目前发生了贪污受贿的严重现象。第五是行政、事务、总务、生产等等单位的人员，这些单位中的若干人员，他们是最接近钱、接近物资的，也是最容易受不法商人的影响、侵蚀、腐化的。从现有材料看，行政事务部门中的若干人员的贪污腐化的现象，也是极端严重的。
    为了使这一运动迅速深入地开展起来，还必须打破若干思想认识上的障碍：
    在公安系统中，公开地、雷厉风行地、大张旗鼓地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，公开揭露和批判公安机关内部的某些恶劣现象，是否会降低我们的威信呢？我们的答复：不会的。天津市公安局公开处理冯景泉侵犯人权事件，就是最明显的例证。只有那些不敢在人民面前公开承认自己的错误，并且不敢认真地进行检讨和改正错误的人，人民才会不信任他们，因而也才会真正丧失了自己的威信。斯大林说：“据说，对于胜利者是不应裁判，不应批评，不应检查的。这话不对。对于胜利者可以而且必须加以裁判，可以而且必须加以批评和检查。这不仅对于事业有益处，而且对于胜利者本身也有益处：那他们就会少骄傲一点，而多谦逊一些。……若是我国共产党害怕批评和检查，那它就会没有多大价值了。……”毛主席说，中国共产党人“随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道我们还有什么错误的不适合人民需要的思想，观点，意见，办法，舍不得丢掉吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘、政治的微生物来点污我们的清洁的面貌与侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？……难道我们还有什么个人利益或错误、缺点，不能牺牲吗？”同志们！如果我们要对人民事业负责，我们就要在人民面前勇于承认和改正自己的错误，并在人民的监督之下，来承认和改正错误。只有那种不以人民事业为重而以个人私利为重的人，才不愿或不敢揭发批判自己的缺点和错误，但是这种人，是一定会为人民所唾弃的。
    在公安系统内展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，是否会影响当前彻底肃清反革命的中心工作呢？我们的答复也是不会影响的。因为贪污浪费和官僚主义如被彻底打倒，只会有利于贯彻和加强镇压反革命的工作。例如天津一分局发生了严重贪污受贿，以至包庇、放走反革命分子的现象，如果不加以彻底的整顿，任其发展下去，我们这个分局不是就要变质了吗？还谈什么彻底镇压反革命呢？
    同志们，我的报告快完了。但我最后还想请大家认识：贪污腐化的倾向如果让它在我们公安系统内存在下去，发展下去，我们对于这种倾向不加反对，不加批判，不加制止，不对贪污腐化分子实行惩办，那末，它的危险性在什么地方呢？就全体情形来说，毛主席曾经讲过：贪污腐化的倾向如果不加制止，不加克服，就有亡党、亡国的危险。这当然对于我们也是适用的。就具体情形来说：如果公安系统有严重的贪污腐化的倾向，有大批的贪污腐化的分子，它的危险性何在呢？它的危险性就在于：如果这样，就有可能使我们人民公安机关脱离人民群众，甚而危害人民群众；就有可能给敌人以很大空隙，使敌人钻进我们内部来，从内部进行破坏，使我们在敌人面前打败仗。
    我们为什么这样说呢？有什么根据这样说呢？
    大家知道：如果人民公安机关，存在着严重的贪污腐化的倾向，就不可能不引起人民群众的反对。事实上，现在就是这样。人民群众对于我们坚决镇压反革命分子，是称赞备至的；但对于我们若干公安人员、警察人员的贪污腐化，甚至向人民进行敲诈勒索，则甚为不满。大家又可以设想：一个公安人员、警察人员，利用自己手上的权力，向人民敲诈勒索，这是起保护人民的作用呢？还是起危害人民的作用呢？至于那些和奸商勾结，甚而和反革命分子勾结，收受贿礼，实行贪污，这在表面上看，似乎并未在人民身上挤出钱来，但国家利益和人民利益，则不知受了多大的损害，这难道还用得着多加解释吗？
    此外，我们的敌人，随时都在睁大着眼睛注视着我们，注视我们人民公安机关内部的一切弱点，寻找一切可以钻进来的空隙，以便给我们以致命的打击。我们公安系统内，如果有严重的贪污腐化的倾向，如果有严重的官僚主义，难道我们的敌人不会抓住这些加以利用吗？难道我们的敌人个个都是懒汉，都是傻瓜，或者个个都睡觉了吗？不是的，同志们！他们在反对人民，反对革命，反对共产党这一点上，并未睡觉，也并不懒惰。他们曾经千方百计地企图勾引我们的人员腐化，以便在被腐化以后，强迫为他们服务。这样的例子，不管在中国也好，在外国也好，难道还少吗？今年春天，在我们的某一个地方公安机关中，曾经有两个当时的高级干部由于他们的贪污腐化，就把大批中外特务分子引进到我们内部来了，给了我们极大的危害。如果不是发觉得早，并采取了坚决的措施，还不知会给予我们多大的危害！你们想想，那些贪污腐化了的分子，堕落蜕化了的分子，怎么能够保证他们不落入敌人的圈套呢？
    如果我们的公安机关有一部分人员由于他们的贪污腐化，在实质上起着危害人民的作用；如果我们的公安机关有一部分人员由于他们的贪污腐化，把反革命分子引进我们内部来了，那末，你们想想，其结果会怎样呢？这样的公安机关，还能成为人民民主专政的重要支柱之一吗？还能属于人民所有并用以战胜敌人和保护人民吗？
    因此，在公安系统内，不能容许贪污腐化的倾向存在，必须严惩贪污腐化的分子，特别是那些大贪污犯，这难道还不明白吗？
    同志们，让我们大家团结起来，让我们全国公安系统所有人员都团结起来，集中火力，遵照毛主席的指示，向贪污腐化开火，向堕落蜕化开火，向铺张浪费开火，向官僚主义开火，一定要把这一场大斗争进行到底！
