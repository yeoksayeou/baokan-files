    The Entire Cotton Farmers of Tunli Village, Yuxiang, Shanxi, Accept the Challenge from the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team
    and Actively Sell and Store Cotton
    To launch the patriotic production increase campaign, all the cotton farmers in Tunli Village, Yuxiang County, Shanxi Province, responded to the challenge of the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team in late November, and also challenged all the cotton farmers in the county. In this challenge-response-competition, all the cotton farmers in the village carefully and strictly divided the cotton into bottom bolls, middle bolls, and top bolls, selling them to the state according to grade, and ensuring that they were picked, dried, and sold promptly. They have already sold 65,000 jin of seed cotton. Village cadres and activists also mobilized the well-to-do households, which account for 30 percent of the village, to collectively store 4,000 jin of ginned cotton for the state, in order to accumulate funds and expand reproduction.
