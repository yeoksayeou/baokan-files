Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 19th: At the nineteenth meeting of the Korean Armistice Talks' sub-committee on agenda item three, our representative continued to refute the opposing side's absurd insistence on interfering in our internal affairs by restricting facilities within Korea and conducting inspections throughout the country, while simultaneously insisting on the unrestricted rotation and replenishment of military forces and weaponry from outside Korea. The opposing side's representative still refused to offer any reasonable solutions to this major obstacle hindering the progress of negotiations, and even arrogantly claimed that our efforts to seek reasonable solutions were merely a waste of time. Our representative sternly pointed out that it was the opposing side that was delaying the armistice negotiations and wasting time. When agenda item three was first discussed on November 27th, our side put forward five sufficient and reasonable principles for resolving agenda item three, but the opposing side expressed fear of our military strength and insisted on conducting rear-area inspections. Therefore, on December 3rd, our side suggested inviting neutral nations to establish supervisory bodies to conduct necessary inspections at agreed-upon ports to prevent any military forces or weaponry from entering Korea from outside. However, the opposing side delayed for nine days; initially refusing to express any attitude towards our suggestion, and then, when it put forward its so-called revised plan on December 12th, it insisted on the rotation and replenishment of military forces and weaponry from outside Korea during the armistice. On December 14th, our side agreed to rotation within reasonable limits. However, for six days, the opposing side has consistently insisted on its absurd demands to interfere in our internal affairs and conduct unrestricted rotation and replenishment, and has even unreasonably refused to consider our opposition or adopt a consultative attitude. Our representative pointed out that after the agreement on agenda item two, the vast number of soldiers on the Korean battlefield and the people of the world all expected the armistice negotiations to be completed within thirty days. The opposing side's arrogant and unreasonable attitude has wasted sixteen precious days, causing the negotiations on agenda item three to proceed for twenty-two days without reaching an agreement. Now there are only eight days left until the thirty-day deadline. If the opposing side continues its absurd attitude and insists on its absurd demands to interfere in our internal affairs, then the opposing side must bear all responsibility for delaying the armistice negotiations.

    在十九日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上
    我方代表严斥美方拖延谈判浪费时间
    【新华社开城十九日电】在十九日的朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方一方面坚持干涉我内政，限制朝鲜境内的设备，并在朝鲜全境进行视察，另一方面却又坚持无限制地从朝鲜境外输入军事力量和武器弹药的轮换和补充的荒谬主张。对方代表对于这一阻碍谈判进展的主要症结仍然拒绝提出任何合理解决的建议，而竟狂妄地声称我方寻求合理解决的努力只是浪费时间。我方代表严词指出拖延停战谈判浪费时间的正是对方。十一月二十七日第三项议程开始讨论时，我方提出了解决第三项议程的充分而合理的五项原则，但对方表示畏惧我军力，坚持进行后方视察。因此十二月三日，我方又建议邀请中立国家成立监察机构在双方同意的口岸进行不得自朝鲜境外进入任何军事力量和武器弹药的必要视察。但对方却拖延了九天之久；始则拒绝对我方建议表示态度，至十二月十二日提出所谓修正方案时，却又坚持在停战期间自朝鲜境外输入军事力量和武器弹药的轮换和补充。十二月十四日，我方又同意了合理限度内的轮换。但六天以来，对方却始终坚持其干涉我内政并进行无限制的轮换和补充的荒谬要求，更蛮横无理地拒绝考虑我方的反对意见，拒绝采取协商态度。我方代表指出：第二项议程达成协议后，朝鲜战场上的广大士兵和全世界的人民全期待着停战谈判能在三十天的期间完成。对方蛮横无理的态度已经浪费了十六天的宝贵时间，使第三项议程的谈判进行了二十二天而仍未能达成协议。如今只有八天时间即到三十天的期限，如果对方继续其荒谬的态度，坚持其干涉我内政的荒谬主张，则对方必须担负一切拖延停战谈判的责任。
