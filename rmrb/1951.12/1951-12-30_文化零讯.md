	Cultural News Briefs

	▲ The documentary film "Resist America, Aid Korea" Part One, produced by the Beijing Film Studio, has been simultaneously released in 265 cinemas across 42 cities nationwide since the 28th. In order to enhance the film's promotional effect, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has dispatched over 20 film workers, including Xu Xiaobing, who went to the Korean front, to various cities showing the film to report on the frontline situation to the audience in cinemas.
	▲ The Northeast Film Studio's new feature film "Gate No. 6" has begun preparations for filming. This film is adapted from the collective creation of Tianjin dockworkers, the stage play "Gate No. 6," which depicts the dockworkers' struggle against feudal foremen. The Northeast Film Studio's feature film "Fighting for Peace" has also begun preparations for filming; "People's Warrior" is being filmed intensively.
	▲ More than eighty kinds of New Year pictures for 1952 in Shanghai began to be issued on the 20th.
	Among the New Year pictures for 1952, those that reflect the theme of resisting America, aiding Korea and defending world peace include Ding Hao's "The Powerful Peace Camp", Min Xiwu's "Welcome the Chinese People's Volunteers" and Gao Menghuan's "Resisting America, Aiding Korea is the Most Glorious, and a Glorious Family is the Most Glorious," etc. Those that reflect the construction of the motherland and the new atmosphere of cities and villages after liberation include Shao Keping's "Harnessing the Huai River and Benefiting Generations," Cai Zhenhua's "Farmers Visit the Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference" and Shen Roujian's "Labor Heroes Return Home with Awards and Honors," all of which are relatively successful. These New Year pictures all give play to the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures in the picture.
	In order to strengthen the leadership of the creation of New Year pictures, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Cultural Bureau and Shanghai's various art groups formed the Shanghai Color Printing Picture Creation Promotion Committee as early as June this year. More than sixty new and old painters participated in the creation. They carefully collected materials and worked diligently on the creation, and held more than ten symposiums and three work observation meetings successively. Finally, the Shanghai Color Printing Picture Creation Promotion Committee selected more than twenty excellent works from more than eighty works, together with the New Year pictures of last year that have been reviewed and sorted out, and printed a total of more than eighty kinds.
	The publication of the New Year pictures for 1952 adopted the principle of "fine paintings and more printing." The distribution of the New Year pictures will strive to go deep into the countryside, so that every household can buy New Year pictures. According to the estimate of the East China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, more than 10 million New Year pictures can be distributed in the entire East China region, which will be an increase of eight times compared with the number issued last year.

    ▲北京电影制片厂出品的文献纪录片“抗美援朝”第一部，已自二十八日起在全国四十二城市二百六十五家影院同时映出。中央文化部电影局为增强这一影片的宣传效果起见，已派出曾去朝鲜前线的电影工作者徐肖冰等二十多人分赴各映出该片的城市，在影院中向观众报告前线情况。
    ▲东北电影制片厂的新故事片“六号门”，已开始了拍摄的准备工作。这部影片是根据天津搬运工人描写搬运工人反封建把头斗争的集体创作“六号门”舞台剧本改编的。东北电影制片厂的故事片“为和平而战”也开始了拍摄的准备工作；“人民的战士”正在加紧拍摄中。
    ▲上海市一九五二年新年画八十多种已在二十日开始发行。
    一九五二年的新年画，在反映抗美援朝和保卫世界和平方面，比较出色的有丁浩的“强大的和平阵营”，闵希文的“欢迎中国人民志愿军”和高孟焕的“抗美援朝最光荣，光荣人家最光荣”等作品；在反映祖国的建设和解放后城市和农村的新气象方面，邵克萍的“修治淮河、造福万代”，蔡振华的
    “农民参观城乡物资交流大会”和沈柔坚的“劳动英雄，得奖荣归”也都比较成功。这些年画在画面上都发挥了民间年画的优良传统。
    为加强新年画创作的领导，早在今年六月，上海市人民政府文化局就和上海市各美术团体组成了上海彩印图画创作推进委员会。参加创作的新旧画家有六十多人。他们精心地搜集材料认真地从事创作，并先后举行了十多次座谈会和三次作品观摩会。最后，上海彩印图画创作推进委员会才从八十多件作品中评选出二十多种优秀的作品，连同经过审查整理的去年的年画共八十多种一起付印。
    一九五二年新年画的出版，采取了“精画多印”的原则。新年画的发行工作，将力求深入农村，作到每家每户都能买到新年画。根据新华书店华东总分店的估计，华东全区新年画可发行到一千多万张，比去年发行数将增加八倍。
