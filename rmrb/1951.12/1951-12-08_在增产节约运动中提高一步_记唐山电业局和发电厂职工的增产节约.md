Taking a Step Forward in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
——On the Increase Production and Practice Economy of the Staff and Workers of the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and Power Plant
Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Wang Tianzhang

    The staff and workers of the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant completed 168% of their fourth-quarter increase production and practice economy plan by November 30th, creating wealth equivalent to 839 tons of millet for the country. This significant achievement is the result of them overcoming certain conservative ideas at the beginning of the campaign, improving technology, tapping potential capabilities, and continuing to improve business management.

    Over the past year, the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and Power Plant have maintained a new national coal consumption record every month in the safety and coal-saving competitions between factories and bureaus in North China and East China; they have also won the safety operation competition three times and received the silver shield award from the Ministry of Fuel Industry's Electricity Management Bureau of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the China Electricity Industry Union. However, the simple safety competition also generated a tendency among leading cadres and workers to only pay attention to safety and not to increase production. Therefore, when the CPC Committee of the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and Power Plant proposed at a meeting of party member cadres on October 21st to implement the resolution of the electricity industry meeting, tap potential capabilities, and increase production as the working policy for the fourth quarter, the chairman of the power plant's trade union said, "The electricity sector is all about safety, how can we increase production?" The CPC branch committee members of the boiler workshop and the steam turbine workshop also said, "The power generation capacity has reached the nominal quota, and coal consumption has dropped to the saturation point. Safety is increase production." Under these circumstances, the CPC Committee of the Bureau and the Plant organized everyone to study and research the increase production and practice economy movement in the Northeast electricity industry. In this way, the conservative idea that the electricity sector cannot increase production began to change among the workers. On October 24th, Chairman Mao's call for increase production and practice economy reached the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and Power Plant. The CPC Tangshan Municipal Committee also specifically pointed out that "patriotic increase production, consolidating safety, and practicing strict economy are the directions for increase production and practice economy in the electricity industry." However, at this time, the staff still felt that "increase production is not our business, but we can still practice economy." The idea that "safety is increase production" still existed among some technicians. The leading organizations of the Electricity Bureau and the Plant again organized all the staff and workers to study Chairman Mao's opening speech at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Li Fuchun's report, and combined this study with work inspections to find loopholes. In this way, the workers' thinking on increase production gradually became clear. For example, He Zhilin, a technician in the power supply section, was originally an activist, but at the beginning of this time, he always said, "Safety is increase production." The workers criticized him for having conservative ideas, but he couldn't understand it. After studying and inspecting the work, the staff of the power supply section discovered that the maintenance time this year could be shortened. However, because they only cared about safety, the maintenance time was too long. They calculated that more than 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were generated less this year due to this reason. After such an inspection, He Zhilin's thinking changed, and he immediately cooperated with the workers to find tricks and researched methods to adjust distribution transformers, increasing equipment utilization by 17%. In addition to the value of saving materials, the power supply section set a plan to increase production and practice economy by 220 tons of millet in the fourth quarter. A member of the CPC branch committee who once thought that "coal consumption had dropped to the saturation point" also cooperated with the workers to find a way to reduce coal consumption as long as the load distribution was economical.

    After the ideological obstacles were resolved, the increase production and practice economy campaign had clear goals. The enthusiasm of the workers to use their brains and find tricks was also greatly improved. They put forward the slogan "Everyone should contribute to increase production and practice economy." Each person also made an "Increase Production and Practice Economy Dedication Book." Each workshop also designated a patriotic increase production and practice economy statistician. Each workshop spread the new achievements of increase production and practice economy on the same day to each other, bringing the workers' patriotic labor enthusiasm to a new climax. After receiving the new task of drying the transformer, Feng Ziting, an old worker in the electrical department, stood next to the transformer and thought: Using a hot air furnace for drying would take four people a month and ten days to complete this task alone; he suddenly remembered the eddy current drying method introduced by Soviet experts, but he forgot how to do it. He went to the section chief to study it, and the section chief said, "Hot air drying is an old method that has been used for many years, so it's better not to make unnecessary trouble." So he found the booklet introduced by the Ministry of Fuel Industry on the Soviet eddy current drying method and experimented with it, and it was successful. According to the new method, it only took ten days, and only two workers were used per day to complete the transformer drying work. This method can save 5,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity each time compared with using hot air drying in the past. After Zhou Kaifa, a technician from the Hangu Substation, accepted the task of installing three 5,000 kVA transformers and one 10,000 kVA transformer, he and the workers inspected the lines. They found that the utilization rate of the existing transformers in the places where three 5,000 kVA transformers were to be installed was only over 20%, so they decided to adjust the lines and tap the potential, and no longer install new transformers. The Hangu Theater needed a capacity of 10,000 watts, so a 10,000 kVA transformer had to be installed, but the existing transformer could only solve the need for 7,000 watts of capacity even if its performance was brought to the extreme. Many people felt that there was no way to do this. The technician Zhou Kaifa calculated the wattage of each lamp in the theater with the theater manager, and it turned out that a capacity of 7,000 watts was enough for the theater, so the problem was solved. The above two items saved 22.25 million yuan. The total value of this kind of technological improvement and potential development by the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and Power Plant in the past two months accounted for about 50% of the total savings in improving business management, reducing coal consumption, saving basic construction funds, and saving materials. The utilization rate of power generation equipment has increased from the quota of 42% to 47.92%. The utilization rate of power supply equipment has also increased from 25% to 37.7%.

    Another gain of the increase production and practice economy campaign was that the Electricity Bureau and the Power Plant improved their business management work during the campaign. For example, the accounting section initially only had a plan to save one ton of rice in stationery expenses in November and December. After studying, they realized that accelerating capital turnover was the "big deal" in increase production and practice economy. They calculated that the material costs of the entire bureau accounted for 80% of the working capital, so they started by reducing material costs and practicing strict economy. In order to overcome the waste of using large materials for small purposes and using whole materials for parts, they established material value vouchers, so that every worker who received materials knew the price of the materials, which played a great role in educating workers to save materials. For example, once two workers went to get 10,000 meters of 1.2 cm rubber wire, and the warehouse keeper said, "We don't have it, use 1.6 cm." The workers who received the materials looked at the price and found that 1.6 cm rubber wire cost 1,300 yuan more per meter than 1.2 cm. They cooperated with the warehouse keeper to find it in the warehouse, and as a result, the 1.2 cm wire was found. This time alone, 13.2 million yuan was saved. The workers of the maintenance team of the power supply section proposed to "be merciful under the pliers," and saved more than 9.6 million yuan in materials in November. The material section also sold 30 tons of cement that had been in stock for a long time. The material cost in November was also reduced by 20% compared with before. When Li Guiqing, a staff member of the business section, was flipping through old accounts page by page to find "tricks," he also found that an installation fee of more than 7,000 catties of millet two years ago had not been cleared, and the Qinghe Farm had not paid the 200 million yuan project fee owed since September last year. The clearing of these old accounts greatly increased revenue. The original monthly fee collection system has now been changed to a bi-monthly fee collection system.

    This surge of patriotic labor enthusiasm is not only reflected in the workshops and management departments, but even the cooks are studying and improving the methods of cooking and delivering meals, reducing the number of cooks from seven to six. The members of the guard team also carried baskets everywhere to find scrap iron when they were not on duty, and did a good job of cleaning up the factory.

    After nearly two months of efforts, everyone felt that they had received the best education in the actual movement. The view that no further progress could be made in the past has been corrected; the problems that were considered impossible to solve in the past have been solved. Where does this power come from? When summarizing the achievements of these two months, the workers said: "The increase production and practice economy policy proposed by Chairman Mao is really good, it has become the driving force for our factory to move forward."

    在增产节约运动中提高一步
    ——记唐山电业局和发电厂职工的增产节约
    新华社记者  王天章
    唐山电业局和唐山发电厂职工在十一月三十日已完成了第四季度增产节约计划百分之一百六十八，为国家创造了八百三十九吨小米的财富。这一巨大成就是他们克服了运动开始时的某些保守思想和提高技术发挥潜在能力继续改进经营管理的结果。
    一年来，唐山电业局和发电厂在华北、华东厂际、局际的安全、省煤竞赛中，每月都保持了全国煤耗新纪录；安全运转方面也三次都得到优胜，并得到了中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局和中国电业工会全国委员会的银盾奖。但是，单纯的安全竞赛，也在领导干部和职工中产生了只注意安全、不注意增加生产的偏向。因此，当唐山电业局和发电厂的中共党委在十月二十一日的党员干部会上提出贯彻电业会议决议、发挥潜在能力增加生产为第四季的工作方针后，发电厂工会主席就说：“电业部门就是安全，怎么能增产呢？”锅炉车间和汽机车间的中共支部委员也说：“发电能力已达到名牌定额，煤耗降到了饱和点，安全就是增产。”在这种情况下，局和厂的中共党委便组织大家学习，研究东北电业中的增产节约运动。这样，职工中认为电业部门不能增产的保守思想开始有了转变。十月二十四日，毛主席增产节约的号召传到了唐山电业局和发电厂。中共唐山市委也具体指出“爱国增产、巩固安全、厉行节约，就是电业中增产节约的方向”。但是，这时职员们还是觉得“增产不是咱的事，节约还可以”。某些技术人员“安全就是增产”的思想也仍然存在。电业局和厂的领导机构又组织全体职工学习人民政协全国委员会第三次会议上毛主席的开会词和李富春的报告等，并结合着这一学习检查工作，寻找漏洞。这样，职工们增产的思想才逐渐明确起来。如供电科技术员贺志麟，原是个积极分子，但这次开始时他总说“安全就是增产”。工人们批评他有保守思想，但他想不通。经过学习和工作检查，供电科职工发现今年检修的时间还可缩短。但是因为只顾安全，检修时间就过长了。他们计算出由于这一原因今年就少发电三万多度。经过这样的检查，贺志麟的思想才转变过来，马上就协同工人找窍门，研究出调整配电变压器的办法，提高设备利用率百分之十七，加上节约材料的价值，供电科订出了在第四季内增产节约二百二十吨小米的计划。曾经认为“煤耗降到了饱和点”的中共支部的一位委员，也协同工人找到了只要负荷分配经济，煤耗还可以降低的办法。
    思想障碍解决以后，增产节约就有了明确的目标。职工们动脑筋、找窍门的积极性也大大提高。他们提出“增产节约人人要有贡献”的口号。每人还作了一个“增产节约献礼本”。每个车间还指定一个爱国增产节约统计员。各车间每天互相传播着当天增产节约的新成绩，使职工们的爱国主义的劳动热情达到新高潮。电气股老工人冯禔庭接到了干燥变压器的新任务后，站在变压器旁边想：用热风炉干燥，四个人光干这件活就得一个月零十天；他忽然想起苏联专家介绍涡流干燥法，但是如何作他却忘了。他去找股长研究，股长说：“热风干燥是多年的老办法，还是不要节外生枝。”于是他就找出中央燃料工业部介绍苏联涡流干燥法的小册子，进行试验，结果成功了。按新办法做，只用十天时间，每天只用两个人工，变压器的干燥工作就完成了。这一办法较过去用热风干燥每次可省电五千六百度。汉沽变电站技工周开发接受了要装五千伏安变压器三台和十千伏安变压器一台的任务后，就和工人检查了一遍线路。他们发现要安装五千伏安变压器三台的地方，现有变压器的利用率仅达百分之二十多，他们就决定调配线路，发挥潜力，不再安装新的变压器。汉沽戏院要一万瓦容量，须安装十千伏安变压器，但现有变压器效能发挥到顶点也只能解决七千瓦容量的需要。好些人感到这可没有办法了。技工周开发就找戏院经理计算戏院中每盏灯的度数，恰巧七千瓦容量足够戏院用，这样，问题也就解决了。以上两项节约就有二千二百二十五万元。唐山电业局和发电厂两个月来这种提高技术发挥潜在能力的总值，就占改善经营管理、降低煤耗、节约基本建设资金、节约材料等方面的节约总值约百分之五十。发电设备利用率已由定额百分之四十二提高到了百分之四十七点九二。供电设备利用率也由百分之二十五提高到了百分之三十七点七。
    增产节约运动的另一收获是电业局和发电厂在运动中改进了经营管理工作。如会计科开始只有十一、十二两个月节约文具费一吨米的计划。经过学习，他们知道了加速资金周转就是增产节约中的“大头”。他们计算出全局材料费占流动资金百分之八十，因此他们就从降低材料费着手，厉行节约。为克服大材小用、整材零用的浪费，他们建立了材料代价券，让每个领料职工都知道材料的价钱，对教育职工节约材料起了很大作用。如有一次两个工人去领一点二糎的胶皮线一万公尺，管库员说：“没有了，用一点六糎的吧。”领料工人看了看价钱，用一点六糎的胶皮线每公尺要比一点二糎的多用一千三百元。他们就协同管库员去仓库找，结果一点二糎线找到了，只这一次就节约一千三百二十万元。供电科维护班工人提出“钳子下边要留情”，十一月份就节约材料九百六十余万元。材料科把积压很久的三十吨洋灰也卖出去了。十一月份的材料费较以前也降低百分之二十。营业科职员李贵卿在一页一页地翻阅旧帐找“窍门”时，也查出了两年前一笔七千多斤小米的安装灯费尚未清理，清河农场去年九月欠下的两亿元工程费也未交。这些旧帐的清理使收入大增。原来每月一次的收费制现也改为两次收费制。
    这种爱国主义劳动热情的高涨，不仅表现在车间和管理部门，连炊事员也研究改进作饭、送饭办法，使炊事人员由七人减到六人。警卫队的队员们在不是值班的时间内也抬着筐子到处找烂铁，作好了清理厂容的工作。
    经过近两个月努力，大家都觉得在实际运动中受到了一次最好的教育。过去认为不能再进步的看法被纠正了；过去认为已经无法解决的问题解决了。这个力量是从那里来的呢？职工们在总结这两个月的成绩时说：“毛主席提出来的增产节约方针真是好，它已经成为我们工厂前进的推动机了。”
