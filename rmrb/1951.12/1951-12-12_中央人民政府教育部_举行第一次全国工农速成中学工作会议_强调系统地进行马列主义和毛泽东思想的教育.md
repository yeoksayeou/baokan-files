    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened the First National Work Conference on Worker-Peasant Short-Course Middle Schools from November 20th to 29th to summarize the experiences of establishing worker-peasant short-course middle schools across the country over the past year and to further advance the work of these schools.

    The conference studied the development of worker-peasant short-course middle schools across the country over the past year. Currently, 40 worker-peasant short-course middle schools have been established in various regions, with 10,744 students. Worker-peasant short-course middle schools in various regions have accumulated some experience and achieved considerable success in areas such as enrollment and teaching. In terms of teaching, teachers in worker-peasant short-course middle schools in various regions have been able to grasp the characteristics of students, connect with their practical revolutionary struggle experiences, and continuously improve teaching methods, focusing on key points in their lectures. Students have made significant progress in their academic performance, especially in language and mathematics. When students first enrolled, it generally took them five hours to write two to three hundred words, but now they can generally write relatively coherent articles of about a thousand words in two to three hours. When they first enrolled, their mathematics level was below that of upper primary school, but now they have been studying algebra and geometry. When most students first enrolled, they were not settled in their studies, but after more than a year of education, they have generally recognized the great significance of the state training them to become construction backbones, and have therefore established the determination to overcome difficulties and study for the long term.

    The conference conducted in-depth discussions on the guidelines and tasks of worker-peasant short-course middle schools. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that worker-peasant short-course middle schools are not only to meet the cultural needs of worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers, but also to adapt to the needs of national construction and prepare to train worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers to become various high-level construction talents. Therefore, the nature of worker-peasant short-course middle schools is different from that of general cadre schools or Party schools, and also different from that of general middle schools. Worker-peasant short-course middle schools are preparatory schools for training worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers to enter universities in a relatively short period of time. Based on the trial implementation in various regions over the past year, the conference decided that the length of schooling for worker-peasant short-course middle schools would temporarily remain at three to four years, and two teaching plans would be drafted and implemented simultaneously on a trial basis. However, the conference believed that it was necessary to streamline the curriculum and teaching materials, pay attention to the connection of course arrangements, and appropriately increase class hours and reduce self-study time. Regarding the issue of teachers, the conference believed that at present, only more outstanding teachers can be drawn from ordinary middle schools to solve the problem. Regarding teaching materials, the conference decided to invite some teachers from worker-peasant short-course middle schools during this year's winter vacation to compile teaching outlines for each subject based on their actual teaching experience, and to study and revise the teaching materials that have already been compiled. Regarding the recruitment of students, political conditions must be strict, and the cultural level should not be too low. The conference believed that it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of worker-peasant short-course middle schools, and to systematically conduct education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as well as current affairs and policies.

    中央人民政府教育部
    举行第一次全国工农速成中学工作会议
    强调系统地进行马列主义和毛泽东思想的教育
    中央人民政府教育部为了总结一年多以来全国创办工农速成中学的经验，进一步推进工农速成中学的工作，在十一月二十日至二十九日召开了第一次全国工农速成中学工作会议。
    会议研究了一年多以来全国工农速成中学发展的情况。各地现已创办工农速成中学四十所，学生有一万零七百四十四名。各地工农速成中学在招生、教学等工作方面，都创造了一些经验，有不少成绩。在教学方面，各地工农速成中学的教师们都能掌握学生特点，联系学生实际革命斗争经验，不断地改进教学方法，进行有重点的讲授。学生们的学业成绩，特别是语文和数学的成绩，有显著的进步。学生初入学时，一般要花五小时才能写二、三百字，现在他们一般在二、三小时内，便能写出一千字左右较通顺的文章了。他们初入学时数学程度还不到高小水平，现在已学习代数、几何。多数学生在初入学时，不安心学习，经过一年多的教育，他们已经普遍地认识到国家培养他们成为建设骨干的重大意义，因而树立了克服困难，长期学习的决心。
    会议对工农速成中学的方针和任务，进行了深入的讨论。到会代表一致认为工农速成中学不仅是为了满足工农干部和产业工人对于文化的要求，而且是为了适应国家建设的需要，准备培养工农干部和产业工人成为各种高级建设人才。因此，工农速成中学的性质，和一般干部学校或党校不同，也和一般中学不同。工农速成中学是在较短的时间内培养工农干部和产业工人升入高等学校的一种准备学校。会议根据一年来各地试行的情况，决定工农速成中学的修业年限暂时仍定为三年到四年，并拟订两种教学计划同时试行。但会议认为必须精简课程和教材，并注意课程排列的联系，适当地增加上课时数和减少自习时间。关于师资问题，会议认为目前只能从普通中学抽调较优秀的教师来解决。关于教材，会议决定在今年寒假期间，约请一部分工农速成中学教师，根据他们实际教学经验，编订各科教学大纲，并研究和修改已经编出的教材；关于招收学生，政治条件必须严格，文化水平不应过低。会议认为必须加强工农速成中学的政治思想教育，有系统地进行马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想以及时事政策的教育。（新华社）
