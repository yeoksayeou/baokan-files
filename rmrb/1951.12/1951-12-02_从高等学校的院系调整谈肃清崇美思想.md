    On Eliminating Pro-American Ideology from the Perspective of the Reorganization of Departments in Institutions of Higher Education
    Zhou Peiyuan
    Our motherland must industrialize. Our construction endeavors in industry, agriculture, and healthcare require a large number of senior technical cadres. However, the existing organizational structure of institutions of higher education makes it impossible to complete the arduous task of cultivating a large number of technical personnel in a relatively short period. Therefore, reorganizing departments is a crucial task in the current reform of higher education.
    The majority of institutions of higher education led by the Central People's Government and the major administrative regions are legacies left over from the old society. There is duplication of departments and groups between schools, talent is dispersed, and the teaching effectiveness is very low. In June 1950, the Central Ministry of Education proposed organizational regulations for institutions of higher education at the National Higher Education Conference. From these regulations, one can see the Ministry of Education's intention to reorganize the departments of institutions of higher education nationwide. However, most of the representatives present at the conference adopted a bystander attitude towards the reorganization of departments, neither approving nor disapproving. At that time, the professors at Tsinghua University were also unwilling to talk about their own problems, always believing that the organizational regulations for institutions of higher education only applied to other schools and had nothing to do with Tsinghua. Only Dalian University understood the significance of department reorganization and, after the Higher Education Conference, voluntarily submitted a request to the Central Ministry of Education to be reorganized into Dalian Institute of Technology and Dalian Medical College—two new types of institutions of higher education.
    Why couldn't most intellectuals accept the department reorganization plan a year and a half ago, so as to better serve national construction? The reason is simple; the main reason is ideological, with pro-American ideology as the main factor. The vast majority of intellectuals have national self-esteem and may not consciously promote imperialist culture and education subjectively. But in fact, because China's old intellectuals have directly or indirectly received bourgeois education, many intellectuals are returned students who have been deeply influenced by education in capitalist countries, especially by American imperialist education. They unconsciously believe that what they learned in the past is immutable and are unwilling to give it up. Some even use English to lecture in universities and are unwilling to humbly learn from the advanced experience of socialist countries. In capitalist countries, it is an undeniable fact that higher education serves the rulers. Engineering students only learn some basic courses in school; after graduation, students must enter factories for internships for a certain period of time. Only after proving that they can be tools for monopoly capitalists can they acquire practical knowledge. Undergraduate training in British and American universities is just very ordinary training, which is beautifully named "higher general education." However, intellectuals worship this set of educational methods. I used to think that it was enough to give students basic knowledge in school, and specialized knowledge could be learned in factories after graduation. This kind of thinking is undoubtedly a remnant of capitalist countries' educational thinking and is not suitable in a new democratic society. We can look at the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's teaching policy in institutions of higher education is to cultivate young people based on the principle of combining theory with practice at a high theoretical level. Students must learn very detailed and specialized knowledge so that they can immediately enter factories after graduation and be able to take on certain tasks. The teaching methods of higher education in New China must move in this direction.
    The organization of British and American institutions of higher education also mixes arts, law, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, education, and finance. Its development is actually unplanned and is a product of liberalism. The basic theory of such an organization is: teachers and students of various colleges live together and can influence each other, which can improve the existing cultural level. The reason why most senior intellectuals could not accept the department reorganization a year and a half ago was that they hoped that colleagues and students in arts, law, science, engineering... would be confined within the walls of institutions of higher education, living a gentlemanly life, isolated from the broad masses of people outside the walls. In addition, sectarianism, individualism, departmentalism, old lifestyles, etc., are all factors that hindered the reorganization of departments to varying degrees.
    In the past twenty-six months, New China's brilliant achievements in various fields—especially the three major movements in the past year or so—have definitely convinced intellectuals that the policies of the People's Government are correct and have eliminated many previously unnecessary ideological concerns. The Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the American imperialist invading army, which awakened intellectuals who had pro-American and fear-of-America ideas. The political studies of teachers in Beijing and Tianjin higher education institutions over the past month have undoubtedly further raised the political awareness of teachers. Therefore, the Ministry of Education's call for department reorganization at this National Conference of Engineering College Presidents has been enthusiastically supported by all representatives, which is completely different from the atmosphere at the Higher Education Conference a year and a half ago.
    The success of this department reorganization, on the one hand, proves that intellectuals recognize that department reorganization is one of the prerequisites for China's industrialization; recognize that New China needs a new type of institution of higher education that can cultivate senior technical personnel with both ability and integrity and a healthy body; and need students in arts, law, science, engineering... to maintain regular contact with the people outside the school during their studies, rather than being confined in their rooms like monks in a monastery to conduct super-social and super-political "academic research." On the other hand, this is also a great victory on the front of eliminating pro-American ideology. We hope that this victory can be consolidated and expanded.

    从高等学校的院系调整谈肃清崇美思想
    周培源
    祖国一定要工业化。我们的工业、农业和医药卫生等建设事业，需要大批高级技术干部，但现有的高等学校的组织形式，决不可能在比较短的时间内完成培养大批技术人材的艰巨任务。因此，调整院系是目前改革高等教育中的一项重要工作。
    中央人民政府和各大行政区所领导的高等学校，绝大多数是旧社会留下的遗产。校与校之间系组重复，人材分散，教学效果很低。中央教育部在一九五○年六月全国高等教育会议中，提出了高等学校组织规程。从这规程里可以看出教育部要调整全国高等学校院系的意图。但大部分到会的代表们，对于调整院系都抱旁观态度，不加可否。当时清华大学的教授们，也不愿意谈到自己的问题，总以为高等学校的组织规程只是应用到旁的学校，而与清华无涉。只有大连大学体会到院系调整的意义，在高等教育会议之后，自动地呈请中央教育部，改为大连工学院和大连医学院——两个新型的高等学校。
    一年半以前，为什么一般大知识分子不能接受院系调整计划，以便更好地为国家建设服务呢？理由很简单，主要的原因是思想问题，其中尤以崇美思想为主要因素。绝大部分的知识分子是有民族自尊心的，主观上或许决不有意识地宣传帝国主义的文化教育。但事实上，因为中国的旧知识分子直接间接地受过资产阶级的教育，许多大知识分子都是留洋学生，受资本主义国家教育的影响，特别是美帝国主义教育的影响特别深，不自觉地以为过去学得的一套是天经地义，不愿意放弃，甚至在大学里讲书都要用英文，也不肯虚心学习社会主义国家的先进经验。在资本主义国家里，高等教育为统治者服务，是不能否认的事实。工学院学生在学校里所学的，只是些基本课程；学生毕业之后必须进入工厂实习若干时日，证明他能做垄断资本家的工具后，方能获得实际知识。英美大学本科的训练，只是极普通的训练，而美其名曰“高等普通教育”。可是大知识分子却崇拜这一套教育方法。我以前也认为，在学校内只要给学生基本的知识就够了，专门知识可在毕业后到工厂内去学习。这种思想，无疑的是资本主义国家的教育思想残余，在新民主主义的社会中是不适合的。我们可以看看苏联的先进经验。苏联的高等学校教学方针是以在高度理论基础上结合实际的原则来培养青年，学生所学的必需分得很细很专，以便毕业之后，可即刻进入工厂，能担负一定的工作。新中国的高等学校的教学方法，一定要朝着这方向走。
    英美高等学校的组织，也是文、法、理、工、农、医、教育、财经混合在一起。它的发展实际上是无计划的，是自由主义的产品。这样一个组织的基本理论是：各学院的教师同学住在一起，可以彼此影响，对于现有文化水平可起提高作用。一年半以前大部分的高级知识分子不能接受院系调整的理由，也就是希望文、法、理、工……的同事同学圈在高等学校的围墙内，过着绅士式的生活，而与围墙以外的广大群众隔绝。此外如宗派主义、个人主义、本位主义、旧的生活习惯等等，多多少少都是阻碍院系调整的一些因素。
    过去二十六个月内，新中国在各方面的辉煌成就——尤其是一年多以来的三大运动——肯定地说服了大知识分子，使他们了解到人民政府各项政策的正确性，消除了许多以前不必要的思想顾虑。中国人民志愿军击败了美国帝国主义的侵略军队，使原有崇美、恐美思想的知识分子清醒过来。一个月来京、津各高等学校教师们的政治学习，无疑地更提高了教师们的政治觉悟。因此教育部在这一次全国工学院院长会议里号召院系调整，获得了全体代表们的热烈拥护，与一年半以前高等教育会议时的气氛迥乎不同。
    这一次院系调整的成功，一方面证明了知识分子认识到院系调整是我国工业化的先决条件之一；认识到新中国需要能培养出才德兼备、体魄健全的高级技术人员的新型高等学校；需要文、法、理、工……的同学们在学习期间经常与校外的人民群众取得联系，而不是像修道院里的僧侣一样，关在房内作超社会、超政治的“学术研究”。另一方面，这也是在肃清崇美思想战线上的一个伟大胜利。我们希望这个胜利能获得巩固和扩大。
