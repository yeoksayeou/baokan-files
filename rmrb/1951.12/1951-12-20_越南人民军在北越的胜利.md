International Commentary

    The Vietnamese People's Army launched a series of proactive attacks in various parts of North Vietnam in early December, capturing several important strongholds of the French invading forces, including Tu Phu in Hoa Binh Province, North Vietnam. They annihilated a large number of enemy troops and seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies. This victory, achieved by the Vietnamese People's Army with the active support of the entire Vietnamese people, demonstrates the growing strength of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary armed forces. This is the most reliable guarantee for the Vietnamese people to achieve victory in the war against imperialist aggressors.
    Under the strong pressure of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French invaders, in order to continue to occupy the occupied areas in northern Vietnam, tried their best to hold on to the "pocket-shaped position" from Hanoi to Haiphong. French invading forces commander Tassigny not only transferred troops from France and North Africa for reinforcements, but also forcibly conscripted Vietnamese youth in Vietnam with the vicious plan of "using Vietnamese to kill Vietnamese" to solve the serious loss of personnel suffered in the war of aggression. At the same time, they gathered the forces in central and southern Vietnam to the north, built fortifications, and vainly attempted to resist the offensive of the Vietnamese People's Army. It is clear that these struggles of the French invading forces cannot save them from failure and death in Vietnam. The victorious offensive of the Vietnamese People's Army in North Vietnam is a clear proof.
    As President Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said in a congratulatory telegram to the commanders and fighters of the People's Army at the front: "These victories are due to the unity of our army and people, and their determination to fight and win." As long as the Vietnamese People's Army and the entire Vietnamese people further strengthen their unity under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, they will surely strike the enemy more heavily and finally completely drive out the French invaders.

### 越南人民军在北越的胜利

    越南人民军在北越的胜利
    越南人民军本月初旬连续在北越各地主动出击，攻克了北越和平省内图富等法国侵略军的重要据点多处，歼灭大量敌军，并缴获了大批武器弹药和军需物资。越南人民军在全越人民积极支持下所得到的这一胜利，说明了越南人民革命武装力量的日益增长和强大。这是越南人民在反对帝国主义侵略者的战争中，取得胜利的最可靠的保障。
    在越南人民军强大压力下，法国侵略者为了继续盘据在越南北部的侵占区，曾竭尽力量企图固守从河内到海防的“袋形阵地”。法国侵略军总司令塔西尼一面从法国和北非调兵增援，一面在越南以“利用越南人杀害越南人”的恶毒计划强征越南青年，来解决它因在侵略战争中遭受到的严重的兵员的损失，同时并将越南中部和南部的兵力聚集到北部，修筑工事，妄图借此抵抗越南人民军的进攻。很明显，法国侵略军的这种种挣扎，都不能挽救它们在越南的失败和死亡。越南人民军在北越的胜利攻势就是一个明证。
    正如越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席在给前线人民军指战员祝捷电报中所说的：“取得这些胜利，是由于我们军民的团结一致，以及他们对战斗和胜利的决心。”越南人民军和全越人民只要在越南劳动党和胡志明主席领导下更进一步地加紧团结，就必能更沉重地打击敌人，并最后将法国侵略者完全驱逐出去。
