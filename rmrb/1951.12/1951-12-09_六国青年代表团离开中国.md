Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: The youth delegations from Australia, Ceylon, Cuba, Argentina, Chile, and South Africa, totaling forty-two people, who were invited by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, left Beijing in early November and traveled south to visit the cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Hankou. The delegates visited factories, rural areas, schools, exhibitions, workers' sanatoriums, and other places, and were warmly welcomed by the Chinese youth. The delegation witnessed the brilliant achievements of the new China in the past two years, the great enthusiasm of the Chinese people and youth in building their motherland, and their firm will to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend world peace. At the Hangzhou Railway Workers' Sanatorium, the delegates heard an elderly worker tell how he sent his two beloved sons to join the Volunteer Army, and how he himself volunteered to serve in Korea, which moved many delegates to tears. The youth representatives from the six countries all expressed that they would strengthen the publicity of the new China, strengthen the peace movement, oppose the US imperialist aggression against Korea, and oppose the arming of Japan after they return home. Some of the representatives of the Australian and Ceylonese youth delegations returned home via Hong Kong from Guangzhou on November 26. The other representatives of the six-nation delegation returned to Beijing at the beginning of this month and left China by plane on the 7th.

    六国青年代表团离开中国
    【新华社八日讯】应中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国民主青年联合总会邀请来中国访问的澳大利亚、锡兰、古巴、阿根廷、智利、南非等六国青年代表团共四十二人，在十一月初离京南下，访问了南京、上海、杭州、广州、汉口等城市。代表们在各地参观了工厂、农村、学校、展览会、工人休养所等，受到中国青年的热烈欢迎。代表团看到了新中国二年来的辉煌成就，中国人民与青年建设祖国的巨大热情，以及抗美援朝、保卫世界和平的坚强意志。在杭州铁路工人休养所代表们听到一位老年工人讲述自己怎样把两个心爱的儿子送去参加志愿军，而自己又怎样报名志愿去朝鲜服务，不少代表被感动得流泪。六国青年代表都表示回去后要加强宣传新中国，加强和平运动，反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，反对武装日本。澳大利亚和锡兰青年代表团的一部分代表已在十一月二十六日由广州经香港回国，六国代表团的其他代表在本月初回到北京，七日搭机离开中国。
