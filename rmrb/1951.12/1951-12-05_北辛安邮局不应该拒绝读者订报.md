    Beixin'an Post Office Shouldn't Refuse Readers' Newspaper Subscriptions
    To the People's Daily Circulation Department: A certain unit of the North China Military Region has been negotiating with the Beixin'an Post Office and its postmen since July to subscribe to a copy of the People's Daily. However, after discussing it with them three times, they were refused, the reason being that they didn't have time to deliver it. Having no other option, we asked a friendly unit at a certain bus station to subscribe on our behalf. The bus station is twelve li away from our station, and we rely entirely on finding someone to bring it to us. As a result, we receive the newspaper very late, sometimes it takes three to five days to arrive, which affects our political study and delays our understanding of the country's economic, cultural development, and the international situation. We hope this can be resolved.

    北辛安邮局不应该拒绝读者订报
    人民日报发行科：华北军区某部从七月份就向北辛安邮局及该局邮递员同志交涉订一份人民日报，但是和他们商量了三次，都被他们拒绝了，理由是没有时间送。我们没有办法，就托某部友军在某地汽车站给代订。该汽车站离我们驻地有十二里路远，全依靠找便人给捎来。这样，我们看报纸就很不及时，有时过三五天才能捎到，既影响了我们的政治学习，更延迟了对祖国经济、文化各方面发展及国际形势的了解。我们希望能予以解决。
