    Shop Assistants Should Actively Report the Bribery of Unscrupulous Merchants
    Editor: In the corruption cases reported in the newspaper, many involve unscrupulous private merchants colluding with ideologically backward cadres to steal state property. I used to be a shop assistant, and over the past two years, I have deeply felt that the lives of shop assistants and workers are improving day by day. This happiness is given by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Therefore, I believe that to be a shop assistant in this new era, the first thing is to recognize ideologically that bribery and corruption are base and shameful and are greatly detrimental to the interests of the state. I suggest that shop assistants must resolutely expose the bribery of illegal merchants and the corruption and bribery of certain cadres, and actively participate in this large-scale anti-corruption movement. This is an effective way to eliminate private merchants' bribery of cadres, and it is also a concrete manifestation of shop assistants loving the motherland.

    Editor's Note: Reader Zhang Rong's suggestion is entirely correct. Shop assistants actively reporting the bribery of unscrupulous merchants and the acceptance of bribes by certain cadres is a concrete manifestation of patriotism. The first letter published in this column today speaks of shop assistant Hou Jiaqin exposing the facts of corruption and extortion by cadres of the Electricity Administration. Shop assistants everywhere should do the same.

    店员应积极检举奸商的贿赂行为
    编辑同志：报上所刊载的贪污事件中，有很多是无耻私商勾结思想落后的干部来窃盗国家财产的。我过去是一个店员，两年来，我深深感到店员工人的生活一天比一天改善了，这种幸福是毛主席和共产党给的。因此，我认为做一个新时代的店员，首先要在思想上认清贿赂、贪污行为是卑鄙可耻的，是对国家利益有很大损害的。我建议：店员们必须坚决地来揭发不法奸商的行贿和某些干部的贪污受贿行为，积极参加这次大张旗鼓的反贪污运动。这是消除私商贿赂干部的一种有效办法，也是店员们热爱祖国的具体表现。    章    荣
    编者按：读者章荣的建议是完全正确的。店员积极检举奸商行贿和某些干部受贿的行为，是爱国的具体表现。今天本栏登载的第一封信，就是说的店员侯家勤揭发了电业管理局干部的贪污勒索的事实。各地店员都应该这样作。
