    The Third Congress of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Exposes the Huge Embezzlement Case of Liu Qingshan and Others from the Tianjin Prefectural Committee
    The Meeting Clears Away the Corrosion and Influence of Bourgeois Ideology on the Party Since Entering the City

    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Third Congress of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which began on November 21st and concluded on December 1st, was an extremely important and successful meeting.  During the discussion of Chairman Mao's call for increased production and practicing economy, this meeting exposed the huge embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This exposure provided a profound education to all the representatives, cleared away the corrosion and influence of bourgeois ideology on the Party since entering the city, and paved the way for implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy.

    A total of 638 representatives attended this Congress. After listening to Comrade Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, convey Chairman Mao's call for increased production and practicing economy and the instructions of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, everyone agreed that Chairman Mao's call was wise and timely, and the North China Bureau's instructions provided them with many specific methods.  Some representatives said, "In the past, we thought that increasing production and practicing economy was only a means to solve temporary difficulties. Now we realize that this is the fundamental policy for the industrialization of New China, and also a necessary method to accumulate funds, gain experience, and accelerate national economic construction."  All representatives further realized that in order to carry out a large-scale movement for increased production and practicing economy, it is necessary to resolutely oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy at the same time.

    The illegal embezzlement of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan was fully exposed under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after the representatives had initially discussed Chairman Mao's policy of increasing production and practicing economy.  The fact that Liu and Zhang deducted disaster relief funds and local grain funds, invested in illegal business operations in the name of government agencies for personal gain, and embezzled public funds for their own enrichment had already been met with dissatisfaction by some Communist Party members who understood the situation half a year ago.  Although Liu and Zhang usually practiced the method of deceiving those above and oppressing those below, as well as patriarchal rule within the Party, and retaliated against those who dared to raise opinions to them, and engaged in various kinds of deception and concealment from superiors, this huge embezzlement case was not publicly exposed for a long time.  However, due to the continuous struggle and resistance of the comrades in Tianjin, and the actual investigation conducted by the leadership, when the Hebei Provincial Party Committee submitted the facts of Liu and Zhang's crimes to the Congress for discussion, all representatives were plunged into this serious and heated struggle.  In their speeches, everyone further exposed the criminal behavior of the major embezzlers Liu and Zhang, their essence, and the ideological roots of this criminal behavior, distinguished between right and wrong, drew a clear ideological line, and at the same time focused on criticizing the bureaucracy of the leadership and examining the liberalistic tendencies of some cadres.

    The representatives from the Tianjin Prefectural Committee pointed out that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan had long abandoned the interests of the people for their own enjoyment. Liu Qingshan used the excuse of illness to recuperate in Tianjin, devoting all his energy to speculation and personal enjoyment.  Even the spending of ordinary capitalists in Tianjin City may not be able to catch up with them. The name of the Production Management Office of the Prefectural Committee was well-known in Tianjin. In order to oppress those below and block those above, they had to strike at some people, win over some people, give money and gifts, and carry out anti-Party small-group activities. The comrades below were doing their work with trepidation.  Li Kecai, Deputy Commissioner of the Tianjin Special District, said, "I raised objections to Liu and Zhang's wrong behavior several times. In August, Zhang Zishan wanted to misappropriate river construction grain, and I refused three times, but it was not effective.  He also talked to me about fraudulently obtaining loans from the bank, and I refused.  Zhang Zishan gave me money four times, and I did not accept it. I heard many complaints from the cadres below, and insisted on reporting them to the superiors, but I was afraid that Zhang would pull in some and strike at others, making it impossible to work, so I did not fully convey my opinions to the province several times, but instead asked to be transferred.  This attitude of mine was wrong.  A comrade from the Commissioner's Office once told me sadly: 'If this problem is not dealt with, the Tianjin Prefectural Committee is in danger of degeneration.'  The comrades insisted on fighting."  The representatives from the Tianjin Prefectural Committee felt during the discussion that this great struggle had saved the Party organization in the Tianjin area, and pointed out that this was an important victory under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.

    In their speeches, everyone also pointed out that it was a serious lesson that the Liu and Zhang incident was not fully exposed and dealt with until today.  The rumors of extravagance and waste by the Tianjin Prefectural Committee in utilizing "agency production" had long been widespread. The serious disunity within the Prefectural Committee had also been constantly reported to the province, and some comrades had also given opinions to the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government directly or indirectly, but the leadership did not conduct timely inspections or did not conduct thorough inspections, which was wrong.  Because of this, major events such as the disintegration of the staff of the Anshan Construction Company were easily glossed over by Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, which further increased the concerns of the comrades below, who were afraid of "not being able to bring them down, but instead harming themselves," and afraid that "money can communicate with the gods," so they adopted a liberalistic and erroneous attitude.  Comrades who had made liberalistic mistakes also made self-criticisms at the Congress, pointing out that "this is a compromise with wrong tendencies."  Individual comrades even thought: "You make things bigger, and when they are bigger, the Provincial Party Committee will know."  This attitude is very wrong.

    During the discussions, the delegations from various regions unanimously recognized the seriousness of this incident. If there had not been a loud call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the strong guidance from the North China Bureau, and the thorough inspection by the Party Congress, it is unknown how many more Liu Qingshans and Zhang Zishans would have emerged, and the harm to the Party and the people would have been unimaginable. If the ideological corrosion of the bourgeoisie is not cleared away, it will be impossible to conscientiously implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. Representatives from various regions generally compared themselves to the Liu and Zhang incident and examined their own erroneous ideas of extravagance and waste, comparing "wealth" and comparing "ostentation."  The Xingtai Prefectural Committee delegation said in its self-examination: "We are satisfied when the superiors solve problems for us, and dissatisfied when they don't. Liberalism, small broadcasting, this kind of thinking and behavior is completely incompatible with the proletarian stance."  Cui Yun, Secretary-General of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee, said in his speech to the Congress: "In leading agency production, I had the idea of 'taking a chance to grab a handful,' and as a result, I grabbed and grabbed and did a lot of illegal things. I must conduct a comprehensive investigation of my work."

    Comrade Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, conducted a serious self-criticism when announcing the news that the Provincial Party Committee had suggested that the Hebei Provincial People's Government arrest Liu and Zhang according to law, and in the conclusion of the Congress. He pointed out that the incident showed that there were serious bureaucratic work styles in the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, and that the Provincial Party Committee should conduct strict self-examination from ideological and political leadership to organizational leadership and even cadre work, and request the North China Bureau to give them punishment. The exposure and criticism of the Liu and Zhang incident can be used as a mirror for the entire Party, which can educate the entire Party, transform its thinking, and improve itself. This is an extremely important gain of this Congress, and it is also the most significant driving force for us to implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy.

    All representatives fully supported the Hebei Provincial People's Government's measures to arrest Liu and Zhang and bring them to justice, and put forward the following opinions to the Congress:

    (1) Expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party, and publicize their crimes to educate the entire Party and fight against the decaying bourgeois influence reflected in the Party.

    (2) The Party organization and the people of the Tianjin area are heroic and good, but a comprehensive inspection should be carried out on the work of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee to thoroughly eliminate the erroneous influence of Liu and Zhang and the bureaucracy and liberalism within the Party.

    (3) All cadres who have accepted bribes and gifts from Liu and Zhang should conduct in-depth self-examination, write a statement to the Party, and await the Party's review.

    The Congress finally passed the Hebei Province's Work Outline for 1952 and two resolutions on carrying out increased production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy. All representatives believed that it is necessary to take immediate action and launch a vigorous struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This is a serious step in realizing the plan for increasing production and practicing economy. If this step is done well, then the task of achieving increased production and practicing economy by 500 million jin of rice in state-owned factories and mines and at all levels of government agencies, led by Communist Party members throughout the province, and carrying out the movement of thousands of villages and ten thousand groups of high-yield in the countryside, will be even more guaranteed.

    中共河北省党的第三次代表会议
    揭发天津地委刘青山等巨大贪污案
    会议清算了入城以来资产阶级思想对党的腐蚀和影响
    【本报讯】由十一月二十一日开始至十二月一日闭幕的中共河北省党的第三次代表会议是一个极为重要的和成功的会议。这次会议在讨论毛主席的增产节约号召时，揭发了中共天津地委刘青山、张子善的巨大贪污案，使全体代表从揭发这个事件中受到了深刻的教育，清算了入城以来资产阶级思想对党的腐蚀与影响，为增产节约方针的贯彻铺平了道路。
    参加此次代表会议的代表共六百三十八人。当他们听取了省委副书记马国瑞同志传达关于毛主席增产节约的号召和中共中央华北局的指示后，大家都认为：毛主席的号召是英明而及时的，华北局的指示告诉了他们许多具体办法。有的代表说：“过去以为增产节约只是解决临时困难的手段，现在才认识到这原来是新中国工业化的根本方针，也是积累资金、取得经验、加速国家经济建设所必须采取的办法。”全体代表并由此进一步认识到：为了开展大规模的增产节约运动，必须同时坚决反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义。
    刘青山、张子善的非法贪污行为，就是在代表们初步讨论了毛主席的增产节约方针后，在中共河北省委领导下被全部公开揭发出来的。刘、张二人克扣救灾粮款与地方粮款、投入机关生产作非法经营、贪污自肥的事实，早在半年以前，就已经为部分了解其中情况的共产党员所不满。虽然由于刘、张二人平时在党内实行欺上压下与家长统治的办法，对于敢于向他们提意见的人进行排挤与打击，对于上级则多方进行欺骗与隐瞒，因而，此项巨大贪污案很长时期未被公开揭发。但由于天津地方的同志们不断斗争，不断反抗，领导上又进行了实际调查，因此，当此次会议中，河北省委将刘、张二人犯罪的事实提交大会讨论以后，全体代表就卷入到这个严肃热烈的大斗争中来。大家在发言中，进一步揭发了大贪污犯刘、张的罪恶行为及其实质和这种罪恶行为的思想根源，分清了是非，划清了思想界线，同时着重地批评了领导上的官僚主义，并检查了某些干部的自由主义倾向。
    天津地委区的代表们指出：刘青山、张子善为了自己的享受，早已把人民利益丢在脑后，刘青山藉口有病，在天津市休养，把全副精力都用到投机买卖和个人享乐上去。天津市普通资本家的花销也可能赶不上他们。地委生产管理处的牌子在天津市是有名的。他们为了对下欺压，对上封锁，就要打击
    一些人，拉拢一些人，送钱送礼，进行反党的小组织活动，下边同志们做工作都是提心吊胆。天津专区副专员李克才说：“我对刘、张的错误行为，是几次提过意见的。八月份张子善要挪用河工粮，我拒绝三次，都未生效。向银行骗取贷款时，也和我谈过，我拒绝了。张子善曾经四次送钱给我，我都未收受。我听到下面干部很多不满意见，坚持向上反映，又怕张拉上打下，无法工作，所以几次往省里提意见都没有讲透，反提出要求调动工作，我这种态度是不对的。专署一个同志曾经沉痛地对我讲过：‘这个问题不处理，天津地委有蜕化的危险。’同志们是坚持斗争的。”天津地委区的代表们在讨论中都感到这次大斗争是拯救了天津地区的党组织，指出这是在毛主席英明领导下的一个重要胜利。
    大家在发言中同时指出：刘、张事件迟至今天才被全部揭发并加以处理，是一个严重的教训。天津地委利用“机关生产”铺张浪费的风声早已很大，地委会内部严重不团结，也曾经不断地有人到省里反映过一些情况，有的同志还向省委和省政府正面地或侧面地提过意见，但领导上未作及时的检查或虽检查而不深入，这是错误的。正因为这样，像瓦解鞍山建筑公司工作人员那样的重大事件都被刘青山、张子善轻轻淌过去，就更助长了下边同志们的
    一些顾虑，怕“弄不倒，反累了自己”，怕“钱财通神”，因此采取了自由主义的错误态度。犯了自由主义错误的同志，此次在大会上也作了检讨，指出“这是向错误倾向讲妥协”。个别同志甚至这样想：“你们把事情弄得更大些罢，大了，省委会知道。”这种态度是很不对的。
    各地代表团在讨论中都一致认识到此次事件的严重性，如没有毛主席和党中央的大声号召，华北局的有力指导和党代表会议的彻底检查，发展下去不知道要再出多少个刘青山、张子善，对党对人民的危害将是不堪设想的。对于资产阶级的思想腐蚀，如不加以清算，就不可能认真贯彻增产节约方针。各地代表普遍对照刘、张事件检查了自己的铺张浪费、比“阔气”、比“排场”的错误思想。邢台地委区代表团的检查中说：上级给解决问题就满意，不解决就不满意，自由主义、小广播，这种思想行为是完全不能和无产阶级立场相容的。石家庄市委秘书长崔运在大会发言中说：“我在领导机关生产中有‘钻空子抓一把’的思想，结果是抓了又抓，办了不少违法事，我必须对自己的工作做全面的清查。”
    中共河北省委副书记马国瑞同志在宣布省委已建议河北省人民政府依法逮捕刘、张二犯的消息时和在大会结论中，都进行了严肃的自我批评。指出：从此次事件中可以看出省委领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，省委应从思想政治领导到组织领导以至干部工作上进行严格检讨，并请求华北局给以处分。刘、张事件的揭发与批评可以作为全党的镜子，可以使全党受到教育，借以改造思想，提高自己。这是此次会议极为重要的收获，同时也是我们贯彻增产节约方针的一个最重大的推动力量。
    全体代表完全拥护河北省人民政府逮捕刘、张予以法办的措施，并向会议提出以下意见：
    （一）开除刘青山、张子善的党籍，并公布他们的罪行，教育全党，向反映到党内的腐朽的资产阶级影响进行斗争。
    （二）天津地区的党组织和人民群众是英勇的，好的，但对天津地委的工作应做全面检查，彻底肃清刘、张的错误影响和党内的官僚主义和自由主义。
    （三）所有接受刘、张贿赂礼物的干部，均应进行深刻检讨，向党写出申明书，听候党的审查。
    会议最后通过了河北省一九五二年工作纲要和关于开展增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的两项决议。全体代表认为：必须立即行动起来，雷厉风行地大张旗鼓地开展反对贪污反对浪费反对官僚主义的斗争。这是实现增产节约计划的严重步骤。这一步做好了，那么在全省范围内由共产党员带头，在公营厂矿企业和各级机关中实现增产节约五亿斤米的任务及在农村中开展千村万组的丰产运动就更加有保证了。
