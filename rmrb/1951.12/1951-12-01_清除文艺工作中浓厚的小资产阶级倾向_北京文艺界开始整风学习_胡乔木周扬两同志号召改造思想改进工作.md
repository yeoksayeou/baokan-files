Xinhua News Agency, 30th - In accordance with the call for ideological transformation made by the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has decided to first organize rectification and study in Beijing's literary and art circles, calling on literary and art workers in Beijing to study with the aim of achieving ideological transformation and work improvement. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles also plans to use the experience of this Beijing study movement to further launch this study movement universally in the national literary and art circles.

This decision of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles was passed at an enlarged meeting on the 17th of this month. When reviewing the current state of literary and art work, the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles pointed out that although the national literary and art undertaking has made certain achievements in the past two years, especially after the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, literary and art workers have played a certain role in carrying out patriotic and internationalist propaganda and education, these achievements are far from meeting the requirements of the country and the people. Generally speaking, literary and art work lags behind the development of reality. The Standing Committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles believes that the ideological root of this backwardness in literary and art work is the tendency to neglect ideology, divorce from politics, divorce from the masses, and cater to bourgeois and petit-bourgeois sentiments. In order to overcome this tendency, it is necessary to adopt the method of rectification and study.

On November 24th, Beijing's literary and art circles held a study mobilization meeting, attended by more than 800 literary and art workers. At this meeting, Hu Qiaomu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhou Yang, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, made reports explaining the significance of this literary and art circle study movement.

In his report, Hu Qiaomu focused on criticizing the shortcomings in the leadership of literary and art work and the methods for correcting them. He said that there is a considerable and strong petit-bourgeois tendency in current literary and art work, which hinders the progress of literary and art work. The petit-bourgeois masses are also working people, but they cannot lead the country forward, and therefore cannot lead the literary and art movement forward. The petit-bourgeois masses can only exert their strength and have a bright future under the leadership of the working class. Our literature and art should not be reduced to the ideological level of the petit-bourgeoisie to "serve" them, but should educate and improve them with the ideology of the working class. Only in this way can our literature and art serve both the working class and the petit-bourgeois masses, and be welcomed by both the working class and the petit-bourgeois masses. In short, our literary and artistic works should make the people of the whole country look forward rather than backward. In order to improve our leadership, Hu Qiaomu pointed out: First, we should use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to carry out study, distinguish right from wrong, and determine our position. Second, we should fully publicize Marxist literary and artistic thought, make literature and art a fighting weapon of the working class, and make literary and art institutions and organizations fighting institutions and organizations. Third, we should rectify the leadership of literary and art circles, oppose the vulgar, perfunctory, and shirking responsibility styles, as well as liberalism and pragmatism, reduce and strengthen administrative leadership, and expand and strengthen creative and critical leadership. Fourth, we should rectify literary and art groups to make them truly responsible for organizing literary and art workers to create, criticize, study, and participate in actual struggles, and supervise literary and art workers to abide by labor discipline and strive to create works needed by the people like other laborers. Fifth, we should rectify literary and artistic publications and oppose the style of shoddy work. Finally, Hu Qiaomu emphasized that Party literary and art workers should become learning models and labor models in the literary and art circles, and should resolutely eliminate any undisciplined phenomena among Party members in the literary and art circles.

Zhou Yang's report detailed that due to the leadership's relaxation or abandonment of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line, a chaotic phenomenon with unclear ideological boundaries has emerged on the ideological front of literature and art. Non-working-class ideology occupies a leading position in some literary and art institutions. Some leaders have lost their due vigilance against various non-working-class ideas. The lack of organization and leadership of political study and ideological transformation work for literary and art workers, the failure to oppose the serious tendency of detachment from politics and life and the serious liberalist style existing in literary and art circles, the failure to oppose the production and screening of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the praise of "The Life of Wu Xun," and the failure to launch a struggle to criticize bourgeois and petit-bourgeois ideas in literary and art work are all concrete manifestations of this fact. Regarding the improvement of leadership methods, Zhou Yang pointed out: (1) We must establish ideological leadership and oppose pragmatic leadership; (2) We must establish collective leadership and oppose individual leadership; (3) We must transform literary and art institutions and groups so that they can effectively undertake the task of uniting and organizing literary and art workers to carry out study and creation.

Those who continued to speak at the meeting included Ding Ling, Ouyang Yuqian, Lao She, Li Bozhao, Huang Gang, Qu Xixian, Hua Junwu, and Li Guangtian. Ding Ling criticized the shortcomings of several national literary and art publications: unclear direction and tasks, undeveloped criticism and self-criticism, and lack of leadership and inspection in editing work. She first conducted self-criticism on the shortcomings of "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette): the direction of "Wenyi Bao" is not specific, and it has not assumed the responsibility of leading literary and artistic thought. Then she criticized "Renmin Wenxue" (People's Literature). The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles or the All-China Association of Literary Workers has never discussed the direction of "Renmin Wenxue." The inaugural speech of "Renmin Wenxue" copied the six guidelines of the All-China Association of Literary Workers as the magazine's guidelines, but did not mention a word about how to achieve these guidelines. "Renmin Xiju" (People's Drama) has never mentioned its own direction and tasks, has no characteristics of the times, and it is not even clear when it was founded. Due to this situation, literary and art publications often publish dispensable articles, and even publish harmful works. The editors of certain literary and art publications are afraid of criticism, and some even have a clique style, unwilling to offend their friends, and recommend bad works. This kind of situation must not be allowed to continue in the future, and the decision of the Standing Committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles on adjusting Beijing's literary and art publications must be resolutely implemented to adjust the existing literary and art publications and concentrate efforts to run several major publications well.

Ouyang Yuqian and Lao She both expressed their enthusiastic support for this study, believing that criticism and self-criticism must be carried out. Veteran writers should also study documents seriously, link them with reality, and transform their ideology like young writers. Ouyang Yuqian made a self-criticism on the work of the Central Academy of Drama. The Central Academy of Drama has not created good works in the past year, because it has not put ideological leadership in the first place. There is a liberalist style among leading cadres. For example, he and Comrade Zhang Geng lack criticism from each other, seemingly "harmonious," but in fact very empty. Lao She criticized the conceited and complacent problems of certain literary and art workers, and reviewed the tendencies in his past works. He believes that humor without principles makes people laugh at everything, which actually promotes a perfunctory and complacent attitude, and a live-one-day-at-a-time attitude, which is harmful to the people.

Li Bozhao reviewed the literary and art work in Beijing. She criticized her own habit of only liking to hear others talk about achievements and not wanting to hear others talk about shortcomings. She said that a Party cadre responsible for leading literary and art work should, in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, not conceal his shortcomings, and promptly review his mistakes. Violation of this provision of the Party Constitution is not permitted.

Huang Gang criticized the ideological situation in the film industry. He said that the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism in the film industry is very weak. Many film workers still lack understanding of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line. The film field still lacks strong proletarian leadership, and as a result, some films with blurred class views and even propaganda of reactionary ideas have appeared. And some leading comrades in the film field can tolerate this phenomenon, which is serious. He suggested that the film field, starting with the leading comrades, should conduct a practical and in-depth review. Qu Xixian's speech pointed out many serious problems in the music field: First, there is no ideological leadership, and no criticism has been launched against the bourgeois creative ideas that are detached from life and supreme in technology; there is no clear direction in music education: there is a tendency to despise national heritage; there is formalism in singing art that does not proceed from life; "Renmin Yinyue" (People's Music) and the Music Association have not played a leading role, and are blind to the problems existing in the music field. The second is that music workers have a serious tendency to be detached from life and politics. Some people think that they can ignore politics when engaging in music, and even develop the idea of treating listening to political reports as a public errand; some people are unwilling to go to the masses to experience life, and only compose music behind closed doors. Therefore, many works replace the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers with the feelings of the petit-bourgeoisie, and such works are naturally not welcomed by the masses. Hua Junwu's speech criticized the tendency of certain art workers to ignore politics and produce shoddy work. Li Guangtian criticized and self-reviewed the shortcomings in literary and art teaching in universities.

The spirit of bravely exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings of the above speakers at the meeting greatly moved the literary and art workers attending the meeting, and their emotions were always enthusiastic. They unanimously believed that this rectification and study in the literary and art circles was timely and necessary, and they were full of confidence in its success.

Those participating in this study include literary and art workers from the following institutions, schools, and groups: the Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government; the Film Bureau; the Central Academy of Drama; the Central Academy of Fine Arts; the Central Conservatory of Music; the Chinese Opera Research Institute; the China Youth Art Theater; the People's Literature Publishing House; the People's Fine Arts Publishing House; the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles; "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette); "Renmin Wenxue" (People's Literature); the Central Literary Research Institute; the Beijing People's Art Theater; the Beijing People's Fine Arts Studio; the Beijing Music Troupe; the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, etc. The study method decided by the conference is to listen to reports and read documents, launch criticism and self-criticism, link with oneself to examine one's thoughts and style, and discuss ways to improve work. Study documents include: Chairman Mao's "On Practice," Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Stalin's Letter to Bedny" (published in the People's Daily on August 12), Chairman Mao's "Combat Liberalism," the four decisions of the Central Committee of the CPSU on literary and art issues, and Zhdanov's "Report on the Magazines 'Zvezda' and 'Leningrad'," and the People's Daily editorial "It is Necessary to Pay Attention to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'."

In order to unify the leadership of this study movement, the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles resolved to organize the "Beijing Literary and Art Circles Study Committee," with Ding Ling as the chairman, and Shen Yanbing, Zhou Yang, Ouyang Yuqian, Yang Hansheng, Chen Yi, Shakoff, Tian Han, Yuan Muzhi, Li Bozhao, Cai Chusheng, Ma Sicong, Lü Ji, Lao She, Jiang Feng, Mei Lanfang, Li Guangtian, Lin Mohan, Yan Wenjing, Wu Xue, and Zhu Dan as members. Each literary and art institution, school, and group established a study committee group to lead the literary and art workers of each unit to carry out study. After the mobilization meeting, each study unit formulated a study plan, convened a mobilization meeting, and has begun reading documents.

    清除文艺工作中浓厚的小资产阶级倾向
    北京文艺界开始整风学习
    胡乔木周扬两同志号召改造思想改进工作
    【新华社三十日讯】根据中国人民政协全国委员会第三次会议关于改造思想的号召，中华全国文学艺术界联合会常务委员会决定，首先在北京文艺界组织整风学习，号召北京市的文学艺术工作者进行学习，以期达到改造思想和改进工作的目的。全国文联并准备利用此次北京学习运动的经验，进一步在全国文艺界普遍展开这一学习运动。
    全国文联常务委员会的这个决定，是在本月十七日的扩大会议上通过的。文联常务委员会的扩大会议在检讨目前文艺工作状况时指出：两年多来，全国文学艺术事业虽有一定的成就，特别是在抗美援朝运动开展以后，文学艺术工作者在进行爱国主义国际主义的宣传教育方面起了一定的作用，但是这些成绩远不能够满足国家和人民的要求。一般地说，文艺工作是落后于现实的发展的。文联常务委员会认为文艺工作的这种落后的思想根源，就是忽视思想、脱离政治、脱离群众、迎合资产阶级小资产阶级的倾向，而为了战胜这种倾向，就必须采取整风学习的方法。
    十一月二十四日北京文艺界举行了学习动员大会，到文艺工作者八百余人。在这个大会上，中共中央宣传部副部长胡乔木和中华全国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬作了阐明此次文艺界学习运动的意义的报告。
    胡乔木在报告中着重批评了文艺领导工作中的缺点和纠正的方法。他说，在目前文艺工作中存在着相当浓厚的小资产阶级倾向，以致妨碍了文艺工作的前进。小资产阶级的群众也是劳动人民，但它不能领导国家前进，因此也不能领导文艺运动的前进。小资产阶级群众只有在工人阶级的领导下才能够发挥它的力量，才有光明的前途。我们的文艺不应该降低到小资产阶级的思想水平来为他们“服务”，而应该用工人阶级的思想来教育他们，提高他们。只有这样，我们的文艺才是既为工人阶级服务，也为小资产阶级群众服务，既受工人阶级的欢迎，也受小资产阶级群众的欢迎。总之，我们的文艺作品应该使全国人民都向前看而不是向后看。为了改进我们的领导，胡乔木指出：第一，应该运用批评和自我批评的武器来进行学习，分清是非，确定立场。第二，应该充分宣传马克思主义的文艺思想，使文艺成为工人阶级的战斗的武器，使文艺机关团体成为战斗的机关团体。第三，应该整顿文艺界的领导工作，反对庸俗的敷衍了事的推诿责任的作风和自由主义、事务主义的作风，缩小和加强行政的领导，扩大和加强创作和批评的领导。第四，应该整顿文艺团体，使成为切实负起组织文艺工作者进行创作、批评、学习和参加实际斗争的任务，并监督文艺工作者像其他劳动者一样，遵守劳动纪律，努力创作为人民所需要的作品。第五，应该整顿文艺出版物，反对粗制滥造的作风。最后，胡乔木强调指出党的文艺工作者应该成为文艺界的学习模范和劳动模范，应该坚决消灭文艺界党员中的任何无纪律现象。
    周扬的报告详细说明了由于领导上的放松或放弃毛泽东同志的文艺路线，文艺思想战线上产生了思想界限不清的混乱现象。非工人阶级的思想在某些文艺机关中居于领导地位。有些领导者对于各种非工人阶级的思想失去了应有的警惕。没有组织和领导文艺工作者的政治学习与思想改造工作，没有反对文艺界存在着严重的脱离政治、脱离生活的倾向和严重的自由主义作风，没有反对“武训传”的制作、放映和对“武训传”的赞扬，没有展开批判文艺工作上的资产阶级小资产阶级思想的斗争，都是这种事实的具体表现。对于领导方法的改进，周扬指出：（一）要树立思想领导，反对事务主义的领导；（二）要树立集体领导，反对个人领导；（三）要改造文学艺术机关和团体，使它们有效地担负起团结和组织文艺工作者进行学习和创作的任务。
    在大会上继续发言的有丁玲、欧阳予倩、老舍、李伯钊、黄钢、瞿希贤、华君武、李广田等八人。丁玲批评了若干全国性文艺刊物的缺点：方针任务不明确，批评与自我批评不发展，编辑工作缺乏领导和检查。她首先就“文艺报”的缺点进行了自我批评：“文艺报”的方针不具体，没有负起领导文艺思想的责任。接着她批评了“人民文学”。全国文联或全国文协都未讨论过“人民文学”的方针，“人民文学”的发刊词上把全国文协的六条方针照样抄上作为刊物的方针，而关于如何实现这个方针却只字未提。“人民戏剧”从未提过自己的方针任务，毫无时代特点，甚至连那一年创刊都看不出来。由于这种情况，文艺刊物上就常常发表一些可有可无的文章，甚至发表了有害的作品。某些文艺刊物的编辑害怕批评，有的甚至有小集团的作风，对自己的朋友不愿得罪，坏作品也加以推荐。这类情形今后决不能容许继续存在，必须坚决执行文联常委会关于调整北京文艺刊物的决定，把现有的文艺刊物加以调整，集中力量办好几个主要的刊物。
    欧阳予倩和老舍都表示热烈拥护这次学习，认为必须展开批评与自我批评，老作家也应该和青年作家一样认真学习文件，联系实际，改造思想。欧阳予倩就中央戏剧学院的工作提出了自我批评。中央戏剧学院一年来没有创作出好的作品来，这是由于没有把思想领导放在第一位。领导干部中存在着自由主义的作风，例如他和张庚同志相互间缺乏批评，表面上“一团和气”，骨子里却很空虚。老舍批评了某些文艺工作者骄傲自满的毛病，并检讨了他过去作品中的倾向。他认为：没有原则的幽默，使得人们凡事都付之一笑，实际上就是助长了敷衍苟安，混过一天是一天的生活态度，对于人民是有害的。
    李伯钊就北京市的文艺工作进行了检讨。她批评了自己向来只喜欢听别人说成绩，不愿意听别人说缺点的毛病。她说，一个负责领导文艺工作的党员干部，应该按照党章的规定，不掩盖自己的缺点，及时检讨自己的错误，违反党章的这个规定是不许可的。
    黄钢针对电影界的思想状况提出了批评。他说，电影界的批评与自我批评的空气很淡薄，许多电影工作者对毛泽东的文艺路线还缺乏了解，电影方面还缺乏坚强的无产阶级的领导，因之出现了好些阶级观点模糊甚至于宣传反动思想的影片。而电影方面的某些领导同志竟可以容忍这种现象，这是严重的。他提议电影方面自领导同志起，应当做一次切实的深入的检查。瞿希贤的发言，指出了音乐界的许多严重问题：第一是没有思想领导，对于脱离生活、技术至上的资产阶级创作思想没有展开批判；在音乐教育上没有明确的方向：存在着轻视民族遗产的偏向；在演唱艺术上存在着不从生活出发的形式主义；“人民音乐”和音协都没有发挥领导作用，对音乐界所存在的问题熟视无睹。第二是音乐工作者存在着严重的脱离生活、脱离政治的倾向，有的人以为搞音乐可以不问政治，甚至发展到把听政治报告当作派公差；有的人不愿到群众中去体验生活，只关起门来作曲，因此，很多作品是用小资产阶级的感情代替了工农兵的感情，这样的作品自然不为群众所欢迎。华君武的发言批评了某些美术工作者忽视政治和粗制滥造的倾向。李广田就大学文艺教学方面的缺点进行了批评与自我检讨。
    大会对于以上发言者的勇敢揭发错误批评缺点的精神，出席大会的文艺工作者，都表示很大的感动，情绪始终热烈。他们对此次文艺界的整风学习，一致认为是及时的，必要的，并且，充满了成功的信心。
    参加这次学习的包括下列各机关、学校、团体中的文艺工作者：中央人民政府文化部艺术事业管理局、电影局、中央戏剧学院、中央美术学院、中央音乐学院、中国戏曲研究院、中国青年艺术剧院、人民文学出版社、人民美术出版社、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、“文艺报”、“人民文学”、中央文学研究所、北京市人民艺术剧院、北京市人民美术工作室、北京市音乐工作团、北京市文学艺术界联合会等。大会所决定的学习方法是通过听报告和阅读文件，展开批评和自我批评，联系自己检查思想与作风，讨论改进工作的办法。学习文件包括：毛主席著“实践论”、毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”、“斯大林给别德内依的信”（载八月十二日人民日报）、毛主席著“反对自由主义”、联共中央关于文艺问题的四个决定和日丹诺夫“关于
    ‘星’与‘列宁格勒’两杂志的报告”、人民日报社论“必须重视电影武训传的讨论”。
    为了统一领导这一学习运动，中华全国文学艺术界联合会常务委员会决议组织了“北京文艺界学习委员会”，由丁玲任主任委员，沈雁冰、周扬、欧阳予倩、阳翰笙、陈沂、沙可夫、田汉、袁牧之、李伯钊、蔡楚生、马思聪、吕骥、老舍、江丰、梅兰芳、李广田、林默涵、严文井、吴雪、朱丹等二十人为委员。各文学艺术机关、学校、团体成立学委小组，分别领导各单位的文艺工作者进行学习。动员大会后，各学习单位都定出了学习计划，召开了动员大会，并已开始阅读文件。
