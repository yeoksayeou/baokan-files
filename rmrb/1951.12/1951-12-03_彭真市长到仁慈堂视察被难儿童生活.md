    [By Our Newspaper] Mayor Peng Zhen Inspects the Life of Distressed Children at the Benevolence Hall
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the Beijing Municipal People's Government announced the takeover of the Benevolence Hall, it received warm support and welcome from all walks of life in the capital. One morning, Mayor Peng Zhen visited the Benevolence Hall to meet with the distressed children and inspect their meals, accommodation, and living conditions. He instructed the management staff to ensure that the children's meals are well-prepared and their health is improved so that they can live and study better.
    Hundreds of liberated children deeply felt the warmth of the motherland. When they learned that Mayor Peng was personally coming to see them, they swarmed forward, warmly holding Mayor Peng's hand. Older children recounted the suffering they had endured in the past and the joy they felt today. Children who had been starving, freezing, and beaten in the past, but now returned to the embrace of the motherland, said "I am happy!" and "I am full!", which had never happened at the Benevolence Hall before.
    Mayor Peng accepted everyone's request and spoke to the children, staff, and nuns, telling them that the imperialist forces had been driven out of China, and the children would never be mistreated again. He said, "Now you are your own masters. Under the guidance of teachers, you manage your own affairs. If you have families, the government can post notices on your behalf to find them." Mayor Peng said, "The People's Government guarantees freedom of religious belief. Anyone who wishes to believe in a religion cannot interfere with another's freedom to believe. However, anyone who does not wish to believe cannot be forced to believe."
    Then, Lan Wucai, who had been persecuted by imperialist elements, came to the stage despite her illness to thank Chairman Mao and Mayor Peng. She said, "We can have today because of the People's Government. Only the Communist Party and the People's Government can stand up for us. We are orphans without parents, and the Communist Party is our own parents."

    彭真市长到仁慈堂视察被难儿童生活
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府宣布接管仁慈堂后，得到了首都各界人民热烈的拥护和欢迎。彭真市长在一日上午到仁慈堂和被难儿童见面，视察了他们的膳食、住宿和生活情况，并指示管理人员务必切实办好儿童伙食、改善儿童健康，使他们能更好地生活和学习。
    数百个被解放的孩子，深深感到祖国的温暖，当他们知道彭市长亲自来看望他们时，便蜂拥而上，亲热地拉着彭市长的手。大一些的儿童诉说他们过去所受的痛苦和今日的欢欣。过去一直挨饿、挨冻、挨打，今天回到祖国怀抱的儿童，说出了“我高兴！”“吃饱了！”的话，这在仁慈堂是从来没有的。
    彭市长接受大家的请求，向儿童们、工作人员和修女们讲了话，告诉他们帝国主义势力已被赶出中国，以后儿童们永远不会再受虐待了。他说：“现在你们自己作主人了，自己的事在教师领导下自己管，有家庭的，政府可以代为登报找寻。”彭市长说：“人民政府是保障宗教信仰自由的，愿信教的任何人不能干涉他信教的自由；但是，不愿信教的任何人也不能强劝他信。”
    接着，曾遭帝国主义分子迫害的兰武才，抱病上台感谢毛主席，感谢彭市长。她说：“我们能有今天，都是靠着人民政府得来的，只有共产党和人民政府才能为我们出气，我们是无父母的孤儿，共产党就是我们的亲生父母。”
