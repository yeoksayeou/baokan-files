    The Reactionary Crime of the Mossadegh Government in Slaughtering Patriotic Iranian Students
    On the morning of December 6th, students from Tehran University and middle schools in Iran held a demonstration, demanding the release of students arrested for "political reasons" and the reinstatement of students who had been expelled for engaging in progressive activities. This legitimate action by the students of Tehran was met with bloody suppression by the Mossadegh government. The occurrence of this incident fully exposed the consistently reactionary face of the Mossadegh government.
    In March of this year, under the pressure of the broad masses of the Iranian people, the Mossadegh government submitted the "Oil Nationalization Bill" to the Iranian Parliament. Subsequently, as the Iranian people's struggle for oil nationalization surged, the "Nationalization Bill" was implemented. However, the path taken by the Mossadegh government in the struggle for oil nationalization had nothing in common with the demands of the Iranian people. On the one hand, it used cruel means to suppress the patriotic movement of the Iranian people, and on the other hand, it allowed the American imperialist agents Harriman and former US Ambassador to Iran, Grady, to interfere arbitrarily in Iran's internal affairs, attempting to take Iran's oil treasure from the British with one hand and give it to the American oil tycoons with the other. This behavior of the Mossadegh government, which betrayed the interests of the Iranian nation, aroused increasingly strong opposition from the Iranian people.
    The Mossadegh government's suppression of the Iranian people's patriotic movement and its atrocities in massacring the Iranian people have become increasingly rampant. On July 15th of this year, the Mossadegh government opened fire on the people of Tehran who were demonstrating against Harriman's interference in Iran's internal affairs, causing serious casualties; recently, it has intensified its persecution of peace advocates. This time, the Mossadegh government has massacred patriotic students in Tehran on an even larger scale. This series of facts proves that the Mossadegh government is a despicable accomplice of US imperialism in plundering Iranian oil and an enemy of the Iranian people.
    The Mossadegh government's bloody suppression of the Iranian people's patriotic movement has made the patriotic people of Iran increasingly aware of its reactionary face. Obviously, this will inevitably arouse wider resistance from the Iranian people against the Mossadegh government's policy of national betrayal and compromise, and further raise the Iranian people's vigilance against the collusion and conspiracy of imperialism and domestic reactionaries.

### 摩萨台政府屠杀伊朗爱国学生的反动罪行

    摩萨台政府屠杀伊朗爱国学生的反动罪行
    伊朗德黑兰大学和中学的学生，在本月六日早晨举行了示威游行，要求释放因“政治理由”被捕的学生，并要求因从事进步活动而被开除的学生能够复学。德黑兰学生这种正当的行为，竟受到摩萨台政府的血腥镇压。这一事件的发生，充分暴露了摩萨台政府一贯的反动面目。
    今年三月间，在伊朗广大人民的压力下，摩萨台政府向伊朗议会提出了“石油国有化法案”，并在此以后，随着伊朗人民争取石油国有化斗争的高涨而实行了“国有化法案”。但是摩萨台政府在石油国有化斗争中所采取的路线，与伊朗人民的要求是毫无共同之处的。它一面以残酷的手段对伊朗人民的爱国运动施以镇压，一面任凭美国帝国主义的代理人哈里曼及前任美国驻伊朗大使格拉第对伊朗的内政横加干涉，企图用一只手把伊朗的石油宝藏从英国手中拿过来，而用另外一只手把它送给美国的石油大王们。摩萨台政府这种出卖伊朗民族利益的行为，引起了伊朗人民日益强烈的反对。
    摩萨台政府镇压伊朗人民爱国运动，残杀伊朗人民的暴行已愈演愈烈。今年七月十五日，摩萨台政府曾向反对哈里曼干涉伊朗内政的示威游行的德黑兰人民开枪射击，造成了严重的伤亡；最近又加紧对和平拥护者的迫害。这次，摩萨台政府更大规模残杀德黑兰的爱国学生。这一连串的事实证明了：摩萨台政府是美帝国主义掠夺伊朗石油的可恶的帮凶，是伊朗人民的敌人。
    摩萨台政府对伊朗人民爱国运动的血腥镇压，使伊朗爱国人民日益认清了它的反动面目。显然的，这必然激起伊朗人民对摩萨台政府卖国妥协政策的更加广泛的反抗，并进一步提高了伊朗人民对帝国主义和国内反动派勾结阴谋的警惕。
