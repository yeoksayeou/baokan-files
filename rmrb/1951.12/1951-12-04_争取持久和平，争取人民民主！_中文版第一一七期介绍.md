    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition No. 117 has been published.
    This issue is a special issue celebrating the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Soviet Union is an Indestructible Fortress of World Peace."
    The editorial first pointed out: The great October Revolution pointed out to the proletarians and oppressed people of all countries the way to get rid of enslavement and poverty; it opened a new era in human history—the era of the demise of capitalism and the victory of communism. The years since the October Revolution have been years of victory for the Soviet regime and years of victory for invincible Marxism-Leninism. Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people have transformed their country from a backward country into an advanced country in a short period of time. The Soviet Union's world-historic victory in World War II and the early completion of the Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan further proved the strength and vitality of the Soviet social system and state system, and proved that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system.
    The editorial then stated: The imperialists' attempts to destroy the Soviet state and prevent it from advancing victoriously towards socialism are futile. The facts are quite the opposite of their wishes. Because the Soviet Union defeated fascist Germany and militarist Japan, the imperialist camp suffered a serious defeat. The working people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, have established people's democratic systems in their countries and are now successfully building socialism.
    The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved victory over imperialism and reactionary forces. This is another major blow to the imperialist camp. For two years, the Chinese people have used their liberated energy for economic and cultural construction, and have achieved achievements that old China did not have and could not have.
    The German people have established the German Democratic Republic and are fighting for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.
    The heroic Korean people have taken up arms and are defending their freedom and independence. Together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, they are constantly inflicting heavy blows on the US interventionist forces and causing them heavy losses.
    The editorial emphasized that the October Revolution, as well as the achievements of the Soviet Union and the achievements of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, have had and will continue to have a major impact on the working class in capitalist countries. The working class in France, Italy, Britain, the United States, and other countries is strengthening its struggle for peace, freedom, and democracy day by day. The movement of the people of colonies and dependent countries against imperialist enslavement and for freedom and national independence is growing stronger. The national liberation movement of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries is now merging with the struggles of the working people in capitalist countries. This movement is shaking the rear of imperialism and seriously striking the world imperialist system.
    The editorial then discussed the Soviet Union's peace policy and the imperialists' policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and pointed out that the people of all countries do not want war. Under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, they are resolutely rising up to oppose the aggressive plans of the US and British imperialists. The editorial concluded by saying that when the working people of all countries celebrate the October Revolution Day, they all look up to the Soviet Union and look up to Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the people of all countries. They shouted: Long live the great Soviet Union, the indestructible fortress of world peace!
    The articles commemorating the October Revolution published in this issue include: "For Peace, Democracy and Socialism" by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, "The Brotherly Alliance between People's Democratic Countries and the Soviet Union Guarantees Their Development Towards Socialism" by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, "The Historical Paradigm of the October Revolution and the Middle Class" by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, "Striving for a Unified, Independent, Peace-Loving and Democratic Germany" by Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, "The Great October Socialist Revolution and the National Liberation Struggle of the Korean People" by Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, "Leninism's Great Victory over Social Democracy in the World Workers' Movement" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and "Soviet Communist Construction Inspires the Struggle of People of All Countries for Freedom and Independence" by Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain.
    This issue also publishes a statement by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of India. The statement said that the Communist Party of India held a national conference in October. After making several revisions to the draft program and policy statement prepared by the Central Committee and the Political Bureau a few months ago, the conference unanimously adopted them. The conference unanimously elected a new Central Committee, which in turn elected a Political Bureau consisting of seven people. Ajoy Ghosh was elected General Secretary of the Party.
    This issue also published news of people from various countries celebrating the October Revolution Day under the general title of "People from All Countries Warmly Celebrate the 34th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution." (Xinhua News Agency)

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一一七期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一一七期已经出版。
    本期是庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年专号。本期发表了题为“苏联是不可摧毁的世界和平堡垒”的社论。
    社论首先指出：伟大的十月革命向一切国家的无产者和被压迫者指出了怎样摆脱奴役和贫困的道路；它在人类历史上开辟了一个新纪元——资本主义灭亡的纪元，共产主义胜利的纪元。十月革命以后的这些年月，是苏维埃政权胜利的年月，是无坚不摧的马克思—列宁主义胜利的年月。在列宁—斯大林党的领导下，苏联人民在短短的时期内就把自己的国家从落后国家变成了先进国家。苏联在第二次世界大战中所获得的世界历史性胜利，苏联战后五年计划的提前完成，进一步证明了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的力量和生命力，证明了社会主义制度远比资本主义制度优越。
    社论接着说：帝国主义要想毁灭苏维埃国家，阻止它向社会主义胜利进军，这些企图都是徒然的。事实与它们的愿望恰恰相反。由于苏联打败了法西斯德国和军国主义日本，帝国主义阵营遭到了严重的失败。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，在共产党和工人党领导下，依靠着苏联兄弟般的帮助，在国内建立了人民民主制度，现在正在顺利地建设社会主义。
    伟大的中国人民在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，取得了对帝国主义和反动派势力的胜利。这是给帝国主义阵营的又一次大打击。两年以来，中国人民把他们解放了的精力用于经济和文化建设，取得了旧中国所没有也不能有的成就。
    德国人民已经建立了德意志民主共和国，并且正在为争取统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国而斗争。
    英勇的朝鲜人民已经拿起了武器，正在保卫他们的自由和独立。他们和中国人民志愿军一道，正在不断地给美国干涉军以沉重的打击，并使它受到重大的损失。
    社论强调说：十月革命以及苏联的成就和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的成就，对于资本主义国家的工人阶级已经产生而且还将继续产生重大的影响。法、意、英、美和其他国家的工人阶级，正在一天天加强争取和平、自由和民主的斗争。殖民地和附属国人民反对帝国主义奴役、争取自由和民族独立的运动正在日益壮大。殖民地和半殖民地国家人民的民族解放运动现在正和资本主义国家的劳动人民的斗争汇合起来，这个运动动摇了帝国主义的后方，严重地打击了世界帝国主义的体系。
    社论接着论述了苏联的和平政策和帝国主义的扩军备战政策，并指出各国人民都不要战争，他们在共产党和工人党的领导下，坚决地起来反对美英帝国主义者的侵略计划。社论最后说：世界各国的劳动人民在庆祝十月革命节的时候，都仰望着苏联，仰望着各国人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志。他们高呼：不可摧毁的世界和平堡垒——伟大的苏联万岁！
    本期刊载的纪念十月革命节的文章包括：波兰统
    一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特的“为了和平、民主与社会主义”、罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治的“人民民主国家与苏联的兄弟同盟保证了它们向社会主义发展”、法国共产党书记杜克洛的“十月革命的历史范例和中间阶层”、德国统一社会党中央委员会总书记乌布利希的“为统一、独立、爱好和平与民主的德国而奋斗”、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成的“伟大的十月社会主义革命与朝鲜人民的民族解放斗争”、英国共产党总书记波立特的“列宁主义在世界工人运动中对社会民主主义的伟大胜利”和西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽的“苏联共产主义建设鼓舞各国人民争取自由与独立的斗争”等。
    本期还刊载了印度共产党政治局的声明。声明说，印度共产党在十月召开了一次全国代表会议。代表会议对于党中央委员会及政治局在数月前所拟订的纲领草案和政策声明作了若干修正之后，一致加以通过。代表会议一致选出新的中央委员会，中央委员会又选出了由七人组成的政治局。阿约艾·高士当选为党的总书记。
    本期还在“世界各国人民热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年”的总标题下，发表了各国人民庆祝十月革命节的消息。（新华社）
