    Tangshan Electric Power Bureau, Hangu Line Work Area
    Completes Power Supply Task for Irrigating 110,000 Mu of Rice Paddies

    Editor: Our Tangshan Electric Power Bureau's Hangu Line Work Area this year completed the task of supplying electricity for the irrigation of 110,000 mu of rice paddies. June was the time when the surrounding farmland was most in need of water, so our electricity load increased day by day. At that time, the main transformer showed signs of overheating, and if we didn't find a way to correct it, the main transformer would inevitably fail. Thanks to the efforts of all the staff in our area, we used manpower and water hoses to splash water on the main transformer, which finally solved the problem temporarily. However, at that time, we still could not supply the electricity demand of all parties. Not many days later, after the static capacitor arrived, everyone rushed to install it overnight, raising the voltage to the rated standard. In this way, we not only fully supplied electricity for agriculture, but also supplied industrial electricity for the Tianjin Chemical Plant and other small factories. When the farmers were harvesting their crops, they happily said, "This year we had enough electricity, which is why we have such good production results. No wonder everyone says that workers and farmers are one family. We will definitely repay the working class elder brothers by increasing production."

### 唐山电业局汉沽线路工区  完成十一万亩稻田灌溉供电任务

    唐山电业局汉沽线路工区
    完成十一万亩稻田灌溉供电任务
    编辑同志：我们唐山电业局汉沽线路工区今年完成了供应十一万亩稻田灌溉的电力的任务。六月份是附近农田需水最迫切的时候，因此，我们的电力负荷也一天天地增加起来。当时，主变压器有了过热的现象，如果不设法纠正，主变压器势必要发生障碍。由于我区全体职工的努力，用人力、用水龙向主变压器泼水，终于临时解决了这个问题。但是，当时我们仍不能供给各方用电的需要量。没有几天，静电蓄电器运到后，大家就连夜赶装，将电压提高到定额标准。这样，非但充分供应了农业的用电，而且也供应了天津化工厂及其他小型工厂的工业用电。当农民们在收割农作物时，他们快乐地说：“今年我们有了足够的电，才有这么好的生产成绩，怪不得大家说工农是一家。我们一定用增加生产来报答工人老大哥。”        严以谨
