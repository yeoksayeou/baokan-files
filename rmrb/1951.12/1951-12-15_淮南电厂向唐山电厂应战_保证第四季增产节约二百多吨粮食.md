    Huainan Power Plant Accepts Challenge from Tangshan Power Plant
    Guaranteeing Increased Production and Savings of Over 200 Tons of Grain in the Fourth Quarter
    After seeing the news that the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and Power Plant employees had proposed a production increase and savings competition to all electricity industry employees nationwide, the employees of the Huainan Power Plant under the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Electricity Management Bureau immediately proposed conditions to accept the challenge. Combining the inspection of savings and waste from the past three quarters, each workshop put forward plans to increase production and save resources. According to preliminary statistics, the entire plant can increase production and save wealth equivalent to 225 tons of grain in the fourth quarter. Among these, the excess electricity generated by flattening the load, after accounting for costs, can increase production by 120 tons of grain. In terms of savings: the first priority is to reduce coal consumption, striving to achieve a reduction of 5.13% below the coal consumption quota approved by the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Electricity Management Bureau for the fourth quarter, and ensuring that the plant's power consumption rate is reduced by 10.87% compared to the fourth quarter quota. In addition, efforts will be made to save raw materials and reduce management expenses. In terms of business management: 1. Ensure that the capital turnover rate is increased to 3.72 times per year by the end of the year. 2. Increase equipment utilization rate by 4.93% compared to the fourth quarter quota. 3. Ensure that the work of clearing assets and verifying funds is completed before December 7th. In terms of safety: all employees of the plant unanimously guarantee to strive for the continued victory of the patriotic inter-factory safety power generation and safe power supply labor competition. The entire plant is currently racing against time to complete the annual overhaul work plan.
    Currently, each workshop is formulating specific production increase and savings plans, and will incorporate these plans into patriotic pacts, unanimously striving to overfulfill the production increase and savings plans. (Huangfu Yan)

    淮南电厂向唐山电厂应战
    保证第四季增产节约二百多吨粮食
    中央燃料工业部电业管理总局淮南电厂职工看到了唐山电业局和发电厂职工向全国电业职工提出增产节约竞赛的消息后，马上提出条件应战。结合检查过去三季中的节约和浪费，各车间纷纷提出增产节约计划。据初步统计，第四季中全厂可增产节约价值相当于二百二十五吨粮食的财富。其中由于压平负荷的超额电量，除应付的成本外，可增产一百二十吨粮食。在节约方面：首先要降低煤耗，努力做到比中央燃料工业部电业管理总局第四季度批准的煤耗定额再降低百分之五点一三，厂用电率保证较第四季度定额降低百分之十点八七。此外并努力节约原材料和减少管理费用。在经营管理方面：一、保证到年底把资金周转率提高到每年三点七二三次。二、设备利用率较第四季度定额提高百分之四点九三。三、保证在十二月七日前做好清理资产、核定资金工作。在安全方面：全厂职工一致保证争取爱国主义厂际安全发电以及安全供电劳动竞赛的继续胜利。现全厂正在争取时间完成全年大检修工作计划。
    目前各车间正拟订具体增产节约计划，并将把这一计划订入爱国公约，一致为超额完成增产节约计划而努力。　（皇甫炎）
