Shanghai Communication: Rich Harvest of Shanghai's Weapon Donation Movement
　　Han Shan

Shanghai's donation of weapons by people from all walks of life has been completed and greatly exceeded the announced donation goal of three hundred and thirty-four aircrafts in early July. By November 26th, the donation payment of people from all walks of life in the city has exceeded 626.5 billion yuan, which can buy 417 fighter planes. This is exciting. This is the glory of the people of Shanghai. Although the completion of the donation plan still varies between groups and between industries, the development of the movement as a whole is as enthusiastic and surging as in other parts of the country. Under the "June 1st" three major calls of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and based on the patriotic education and Resist America and Aid Korea movement over the past year, this donation of aircraft and artillery movement is magnificent, lasting, and practical. In Shanghai, this movement has the following four main characteristics:

First, the development of the movement is planned, step-by-step, and led. June is generally a stage for extensive and in-depth publicity and deliberation of donation plans. At that time, the leadership accepted the experience of last year's promotion of public bonds, and saw that a few active masses adopted some inappropriate donation methods after the "June 1st" three major calls of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea were issued. Therefore, they emphasized the need to publicize and educate the significance and methods of donation; and emphasized that the donation plan should be formulated on the basis of revising the patriotic pact. During this period, people from all walks of life and people's organizations held many discussions, seminars, and study classes, and checked the patriotic pacts of grass-roots units, which was very helpful for the development of the movement. July and August generally entered the stage of formulating donation plans. Especially around July 1st, in order to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, people's organizations successively formulated their respective donation plans: the trade union donated 50 aircraft and one cannon, the Democratic Women's Federation and the Family Women's Federation donated 7 aircraft, the cultural and educational circles donated 2 aircraft, the suburban peasants donated 1 aircraft, young students donated 1 aircraft, organ staff donated 2 aircraft, and other people's organizations donated a total of 1 aircraft; the industrial and commercial circles had reached a consensus at this time and announced the donation of 270 aircraft. By the end of August, 248 industries in the industrial and commercial circles had formulated donation plans, with a total amount of about 400 billion yuan. Now the donation plan of 276 industries of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce has reached 500 billion yuan, which greatly exceeds the original plan of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. There are three main ways to formulate donation plans: first, the combination of top-down and bottom-up; second, consultation between labor and management and mutual encouragement and assistance between collectives; and third, the mutual combination and mutual guarantee of patriotic pacts and donation plans. In this way, the donation plan is formulated quite universally and accurately. September entered the stage of collective payment. Although the various groups had made voluntary payments in July and August, the methods were disorganized. In September, payment methods were established with the People's Bank, and donation payments entered a more organized stage. In short, after three stages of development and promotion, the movement is steady and powerful.

Second, the donation movement showed the rich creativity of the masses. Donation is mass-based. Relying on the infinite wisdom and high patriotic consciousness of the people, there will inevitably be various good methods. The donation methods in the industrial and commercial circles adopt the "basic donation" method, which generally donates 1% to 2.5% of the business volume of each enterprise, and a few donate up to 4% or 5%. Two hundred trade associations mainly use this method. In addition, there are plans to adopt one or two or three kinds of donation methods such as surplus donation, saving donation, increasing production donation, personal donation and other methods. On the employee side, there are: (1) wage donation, one to two or three days of wages per month, or even five or six days of wages, and some people want to donate like this until the end of the Korean War; (2) donation of part or all of the bonus; (3) donation of wages for voluntary labor overtime; (4) saving raw materials donation; (5) signing a contract with the employer to increase production donation; (6) others, such as improving technology or estimating work or guaranteeing no accidents for 100 days or 200 days to donate bonuses, or contracting work in their spare time, etc. Higher education employees and the scientific community closely combine the three tasks of compiling popular science books, manufacturing, and service with their own business, and donate the income. The art world uses the proceeds from charity performances as donations.

Third, donation payments showed organization and enthusiasm. Before August 27, the voluntary payment of the industrial and commercial circles was only 11.7 billion yuan, which was not as much as the trade union paid. After September 1, the Federation of Industry and Commerce organized the first collective payment, and 104 industries paid 89 billion yuan. Then, under the promotion of the Second Congress of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the second collective payment was held; when celebrating the first anniversary of the Resistance to America and Aid Korea, the third collective payment was generally called for. By November 9, the industrial and commercial circles had paid more than 415.4 billion yuan, and the number of payment households had reached more than 100,000. Individual industries have paid 200%, and four industries such as cement and fruit have paid off at once. In addition, the trade union has paid 90%, students, suburban peasants, and women have all paid more than 100%, organ staff have paid 162%, and the cultural and educational circles have paid 225%. Up to this point, except for the suburban farmers' association, the promise of timely payment has generally been fulfilled. However, in the units under the various groups, there are still some imbalances, which still need to be overcome.

Fourth, the combination of donation and increasing production and saving has created preliminary experience, proving that the combination of donation and increasing production and saving is the best way to mobilize the enthusiasm of employees and employers, do a good job in production, benefit both labor and capital, and support the front line. In the past four months, under the promotion of the Chinese Communist Party's grass-roots organizations and trade unions, 168 to 200 large, medium and small factories in the city have signed donation contracts for increasing production and saving excess profits through labor-management consultation meetings. In these factories, although there was a period of controversy and stalemate due to the production quota and the proportion of excess profit donation allocation, after the Municipal Consultative Conference convened an enlarged labor-management consultation meeting and determined the principles and standards, the road to increasing production, saving and donation was quickly opened up. At present, the method of formulating donation for increasing production and saving generally includes three aspects: (1) income increased due to saving raw materials, main machinery and materials, water and electricity, fuel and other materials; (2) income increased due to improving quality and reducing defective products; (3) increased excess income due to increased output. Because

Generally, private factories often have no production plans, incomplete production records, and a wide variety of products, which makes it difficult to convert and set accurate scientific quotas in a short period of time. At present, the production quota is generally stipulated in the contract as the average quota for the three months before June, or the average quota for one to six months. The distribution of excess profits in the contract is generally 70% or 60% or 75%, and labor and management each voluntarily donate half; 15% or 10% is used as employee bonuses or employee collective welfare; 10% or 15% is used as the employer's working capital or "machine maintenance fund"; 5% or 10% is used as the fund for preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs. All those who sign contracts in this way have greatly improved production quality, greatly saved materials, greatly reduced defective and substandard products, and increasingly increased rationalization proposals and technological improvements. For example, the tire department of Zhengtai Rubber Factory produces 106 pieces per day (the average daily output of the three months of April, May and June is 96 pieces); after signing the donation contract, it produces 123 to 150 pieces per day; after the nine female workers in the cutting tire department pay attention to saving, they can save 400 million yuan in six months; the production savings and excess profits of the whole factory can be converted into more than two aircraft. For example, the original defective products of Mei Ya Silk Factory accounted for 50% of the finished products. In the second month after signing the donation contract, the defective products were reduced to 10%. With a 22% increase in production in November last year as the quota, and a 34% increase in production as the goal, the goal was achieved in the second month. Therefore, the plan to increase production and donate 120 million yuan in three months was completed in two months. Another example is Zhou Longquan, a worker in the pharmacy room of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory No. 1, who has successfully reduced the amount of important raw material carbon black when testing the manufacture of automobile tire lining tires, reducing each one from 15 and a half pounds to 5 pounds of carbon black; the whole factory saves more than 1,000 pounds of carbon black per month, and can save about 4.5 billion yuan throughout the year. Not only will it contribute to donations, but it is also a valuable contribution to the production of the rubber industry. In addition, if the trade union of the Heping Machine Factory launches a campaign to strive for excess production, Li Guihua alone improved six kinds of tools in September, which increased the output by 30% to 100%, and the quality was also doubled compared with before. The output of each paper mill generally exceeded the original quota by more than 20%. The Great China Paper Mill exceeded 60%. Each light bulb factory reduced the scrap rate from an average of 10% in May to an average of 0.4%, with the least reaching 0.2%. Large factories such as Shenxin and Yong'an also have similar achievements. Even the China Industrial Liquefied Gas Company, which has only 57 employees, has paid a total of 100.954 million yuan due to the monthly increase in production and wage donation, exceeding the original plan by 210%. There are so many examples of increasing production, saving and donating that it is impossible to list them all. This shows that the banner of patriotic increasing production, saving and donating weapons is glorious and great. It is a true and unbreakable truth to rely on the working class to do a good job in production.

The successful development of this weapon donation movement should not be viewed in isolation only from the donation mobilization, but should be regarded as a concrete manifestation of the patriotic political consciousness of the broad masses of the people, and is also inseparable from the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the past year, as well as striving for financial and economic improvement and the efforts of employees to increase production. In the past year, people from all walks of life in Shanghai have launched a vigorous campaign to resist America and aid Korea, using various methods to conduct patriotic and internationalist education, and have more universally and deeply formulated and revised patriotic pacts. Students and shop assistants who signed patriotic pacts accounted for 90% to 95% of their total number, while industrial workers and industrial and commercial circles accounted for 70%, and lane residents accounted for 60%. A lot of work has also been done on preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and condolences to the wounded and sick soldiers. For example, in helping to solve the practical difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs, 1,220 families of revolutionary martyrs have been introduced to obtain employment, and more than 7,890 children of revolutionary martyrs have been able to enter school through means such as reducing or waiving tuition and miscellaneous fees. In addition, before the "June 1st" call of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the people of Shanghai donated more than 24 billion yuan for bullet payments, condolences to the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers, and relief to Korean refugees. In the movement to defend world peace, the people of Shanghai responded to the call of the World Peace Council and signed the Stockholm Peace Declaration with 4.65 million people. The number of people who signed in favor of concluding a peace treaty between the five major powers and voted against the United States rearming Japan was also more than 4.05 million. In addition, hundreds of thousands to millions of people visited the Shanghai-held exhibitions on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, resisting America and aiding Korea, street exhibitions, native product exchange exhibitions, land reform exhibitions, and other cultural and educational exhibitions. These have greatly helped to improve the patriotic and internationalist ideology of people from all walks of life.

All of these fully prove that under the leadership of the great Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, the spirit of patriotism and internationalism of the Shanghai people is becoming increasingly high, gathering a strong force, and responding to all the calls of the motherland. At the same time, it also fully proves that the banner of new patriotism can attract and unite the broad masses of the people, has a great impetus for all work, and the patriotic pact movement is the best way to lead the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to a regular and lasting one.

In short, the patriotic donation movement in this period is steadily upward. However, it still has many shortcomings, the most important of which is the unbalanced state and some formalism in the movement. For example, there are still more than 30,000 households in the industrial and commercial circles that are lagging behind, and have not yet expressed their willingness to donate, let alone donate a penny; some factories have not vigorously developed the combination of increasing production, saving and donating weapons. This requires us to accept the experience of this period and carry out the movement to increase production and save on a larger scale; we must never be complacent and slack because the overall donation goal has been completed. We must still seize every political link (such as conveying the various reports and resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), continue to deeply carry out patriotic education, formulate and revise patriotic pacts; strengthen the internal inspection and consultation of various groups; implement consultation between labor and management, and timely adjust labor-management relations in increasing production, saving and donation, and other major issues; mobilize everyone to further respond to the call in the resolution on resisting America and aiding Korea work of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "Continue to mobilize our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front." This is an exceptionally glorious job, which will make the Chinese People's Volunteers even more powerful, make our production and construction more secure, and make the future large-scale national construction work have a more solid foundation.

　　上海通讯上海市捐献武器运动的丰富收获
　　含山
    上海市各界人民的捐献武器计划，以七月初各界所宣布的捐献目标（三百三十四架飞机）来说，那是已经完成而且大大超过了；到十一月二十六日止全市人民缴纳献款已经在六千二百六十五亿元以上，可购战斗机四百一十七架。这是令人兴奋的。这是上海人民的光荣。虽然团体与团体之间、各行业单位之间的完成捐献计划的情形仍然是不平衡的，但总的来说，运动的开展像全国各地一样是热烈的、汹涌澎湃的。在中国人民抗美援朝总会“六一”三大号召之下，和一年来的爱国主义教育与抗美援朝运动的基础上，这一次捐献飞机大炮的运动波澜壮阔，而且持久、实际。在上海，这次运动有如下四个主要特点：
    第一、运动的发展是有计划、有步骤、有领导的。六月份一般是广泛深入宣传和酝酿捐献计划的阶段。那时，领导方面接受了去年推销公债运动的经验，并且看到抗美援朝总会“六一”三大号召发出后少数积极群众采用了一些不妥当的捐献方式，因此强调指出对于捐献意义和捐献方式要普遍进行宣传教育；并强调指出要在修订爱国公约的基础上来酝酿制订捐献计划。各界人民、各人民团体在这一时期举行了许多次讨论会、座谈会、学习班，并对基层单位的爱国公约进行了检查，这对于运动的开展是很有帮助的。七、八月份一般是进入订立捐献计划的阶段。尤其在七月一日前后，各人民团体为了庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年纪念，都先后订出了各自的捐献计划：工会捐献飞机五十架、炮一门，民主妇联与家庭妇联捐献飞机七架，文教界捐献飞机二架，郊区农民捐献飞机一架，青年学生捐献飞机一架，机关工作人员捐献飞机二架，其他人民团体共捐献飞机一架；工商界在这时已经酝酿一致，宣布捐献飞机二百七十架。八月底，工商界已有二百四十八个行业订出了捐献计划，金额共约四千亿元。现在上海工商联二百七十六个行业的捐献计划已达五千亿元，大大超过了工商联原定的计划。捐献计划的订立有三种主要方式：首先是自上而下与自下而上相结合；其次是劳资双方协商与集体间的互励互助；再其次是爱国公约与捐献计划互相结合和互相保证。这样，捐献计划就订得相当普遍而且准确。九月份进入了集体缴款的阶段。各团体虽在七、八月间即有自动缴款的，但办法零乱。九月，和人民银行订立了缴款办法，捐献缴款走上了更有组织性的阶段。总之，经过三个阶段的发展和推动，运动是稳步而有力的。
    第二、捐献运动的方式表现了群众的丰富的创造性。捐献是群众性的，依靠人民群众无限的智慧和高度的爱国主义自觉，就必然会有各种各样的好方式出现。工商界各行业中的捐献方式有采用“基本捐献”方式的，是按照各该企业的营业额一般捐出百分之一至百分之二点五，也有少数捐至百分之四或五。有二百个同业公会主要是采用这种方式的。此外也有采用盈余捐献、节约捐献、增产捐献、个人捐献及其它方式订立一种或二、三种捐献方式的计划。在职工方面有：（一）工资捐献，每月一工至二、三工，甚至有五、六工，还有的要这样捐到朝鲜战争结束；（二）奖金一部或全部捐献；（三）义务劳动加班加点工资捐献；（四）节约原料捐献；（五）与资方订立增产捐献合同；（六）其它，如改进技术或估工或保证一百天、二百天不出事故捐献奖金，或利用业余时间包揽工作等。高等教育员工和科学界则以编译科学普及书籍及制造、服务三者与自己的业务密切结合，把所得捐献出来。艺术界则以义演所得作为捐献。
    第三、捐献缴款表现了组织性和积极性。在八月二十七日前，工商界自动缴款仅为一百一十七亿元，还不如工会缴得多。九月一日以后，工商联组织了第一次集体缴款，缴款行业一百零四业缴了八百九十亿。随后又在工商联第二次代表会议推动之下，举行了第二次集体缴款；庆祝抗美援朝一周年时，又普遍号召了第三次集体缴款。到十一月九日止，工商界已缴了四千一百五十四亿元以上，缴款户数已达十万多户。个别行业已缴款百分之二百，水泥、水果等四个行业已一次缴清。此外，工会已缴百分之九十，学生、郊区农民、妇女都已缴了百分之百以上，机关工作人员已缴了百分之一百六十二，文教界已缴了百分之二百二十五。到这时为止，除郊区农会外，一般都实现了按期缴款的诺言。但在各界团体所属单位，还有一些不平衡的现象，仍然须要努力克服。
    第四、捐献与增产节约相结合，创造了初步的经验，证明了捐献与增产节约相结合是发挥职工和资方的积极性、搞好生产、劳资两利、支援前线最好的方式。四个月来，在中国共产党基层组织和工会推动下，全市已经有大中小一百六十八个工厂至二百个工厂，通过劳资协商会议，订立了增产节约超额利润的捐献合同。在这些工厂中，虽然曾经因生产定额和超额利润捐献分配的比例问题发生过一度的争论和僵持，但经过市协商会议召开了扩大的劳资协商会议，确定了原则与标准之后，就很快地打开了增产节约捐献的道路。目前订立增产节约捐献的办法，一般包括三个方面，即：（一）节约原料、主要机物料、水电、燃料及其他物料等而增加的收入；（二）由于提高品质减少废品次品而增加的收入；（三）提高产量而增加的超额收入。由于
    一般私营工厂往往是生产无计划，生产记录不全以及产品种类繁多，折算困难，短期间难以订定精确的科学定额。目前生产定额一般在合同中规定了六月以前的三个月平均定额，或一月至六月六个月的平均定额。超额利润的分配在合同中大体是以百分之七十或六十或七十五，由劳资双方各半自愿捐献；以百分之十五或百分之十作为职工奖金或职工集体福利；以百分之十或十五作为资方流动资金或“机器保养金”；以百分之五或百分之十作为优抚烈军属基金。凡是这样订立合同的，生产质量都大大提高，物料大大节省，次货废品大大减少，合理化建议和技术改进也日益增多。如正泰橡胶厂轮胎部定额每天生产一百零六只（四五六三个月平均每天出产九十六只）；订立捐献合同后，每天出产一百二十三只至一百五十只；剪胎部九个女工注意节约后，六个月可节省四亿元；全厂生产节约超额利润折两架飞机有余。如美亚绸厂原有次货占成品百分之五十，订立捐献合同后第二个月则次货减少至百分之十。以去年十一月生产量增加百分之二十二为定额，并以增产百分之三十四为目标，结果第二个月就达到了目标。因此三个月增产捐献一亿二千万元的计划，两个月就完成了。又如大中华橡胶一厂配药间工人周龙泉，在试验制造汽车胎衬胎时，减少重要原料墨灰的用量已试验成功，每只由十五磅半减少到五磅墨灰；全厂每月节省墨灰一千余磅，全年约可节省四十五亿元。不仅对捐献将有所贡献，而且在橡胶工业生产上是极有价值的贡献。此外如平和机器厂工会发动争取生产超额后，只李桂华师傅一人在九月份就改进了六种工具，使产量提高了百分之三十至百分之一百，而且品质也较前提高了一倍。造纸业各厂产量普遍超过原来定额百分之二十以上。大中华造纸厂则更超过百分之六十。灯泡业各厂使废品率由五月份平均百分之十减少到平均千分之四，最少的达到千分之二。大厂如申新、永安也有类似的成绩。甚至像仅有五十七名职工的中国工业炼气公司，因为生产逐月提高，加工资捐献一共已缴款一亿零九百五十四万多元，超过原定计划百分之二百一十。像这样增产节约捐献的例子，真是不胜枚举。这说明爱国增产节约捐献武器的旗帜是光荣的、伟大的。依靠工人阶级搞好生产是千真万确牢不可破的真理。
    这次捐献武器运动所以能胜利地开展，自然不应该孤立地只从捐献动员上去看，而应看作是广大人民群众爱国主义政治觉悟的具体表现，也是和一年来抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动以及争取财政经济好转、职工努力提高生产分不开的。一年来上海各界人民展开轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，运用了各种各样方式进行了爱国主义与国际主义的教育，并且比较普遍深入地订立与修订了爱国公约。学生、店员签订爱国公约的占其总人数的百分之九十至九十五，产业工人与工商界也都各占百分之七十，里弄居民占百分之六十。对于优待烈军属和慰劳伤病员，也进行了不少工作。例如在帮助解决烈军属的实际困难上，已有烈军属一千二百二十人经介绍获得职业，七千八百九十多个烈军属子弟经过减免学杂费等办法，得以升学入学。此外，上海人民在抗美援朝总会“六一”号召以前，还捐献了子弹代金、慰劳中朝人民战士和救济朝鲜难民的捐款共二百四十多亿元。在保卫世界和平运动中，上海人民响应世界和大号召，在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的有四百六十五万名，签名拥护缔结五大国和平公约和投票反对美国重新武装日本的人数也有四百零五万人以上。此外，参观上海举办的镇压反革命展览会、抗美援朝展览会、各街道展览会、土产交流展览会、土地改革展览会，及其他文化教育展览会的群众都有数十万以至数百万。这些对于各界人民的爱国主义与国际主义思想的提高都有很大的帮助。
    所有这些，都充分地证明了上海人民在伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席领导之下，爱国主义与国际主义的精神日益昂扬，团聚了雄厚的力量，响应祖国的一切号召。同时，也充分地证明了新爱国主义的旗帜最能吸引与团结广大群众，对于一切工作具有极大的推动力，爱国公约运动是把广大人民爱国热情引向经常持久的最好的方法。
    总之，这一时期爱国捐献运动是步步向上的。但是，也还带着不少缺点，最主要的还是运动中有不平衡状态和某些形式主义。例如，工商界中还有三万多户是落后的，还没有表示他们要捐献，更无分文捐献；有些工厂增产节约与捐献武器相结合还没有大力开展。这就需要我们接受这一时期的经验，把增产节约运动更大规模地开展起来；绝不能因为总的捐献目标已经完成而有丝毫自满自骄和松懈。仍然要抓紧每一个政治环节（如传达人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议各项报告和决议），继续深入进行爱国主义教育，订立与修订爱国公约；加强各界团体内部的检查与协商；贯彻劳资双方协商，及时调整增产节约捐献中的劳资关系等等主要问题；动员大家进一步响应中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议关于抗美援朝工作的决议中的号召，“继续动员我们的人力、物力和财力，支援朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军”。这是异常光荣的工作，这会使中国人民志愿军更有威力，使我们的生产建设更有保障，使将来更大规模的国家建设工作得到更坚实的基础。
