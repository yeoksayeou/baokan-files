Everyone Rise Up Against Corruption and Waste

I. Corruption and Waste are the Enemies of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

The acts of corruption and waste are the greatest enemies of the current patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy. As everyone knows, since the national liberation, the Chinese Communist Party's style of hard work and plain living has had a transformative impact. The People's Government is the most honest and efficient government in Chinese history. However, we cannot assume that the ugly things left over from the Kuomintang's reactionary rule have been completely eradicated today. Because there are many staff members in our government and economic organs who worked in the old society, a few of them have not changed their corrupt and degenerate Kuomintang style. A large proportion of those found to have committed corruption are these people. In addition, there are a very few staff members who, although they did not work in the old society, and some have even done revolutionary work for many years, but because they have selfish and self-interested individualistic thoughts, they cannot withstand the test of money and material life, and they have accepted the influence of the bad style left over from the Kuomintang and the bad style of the bourgeoisie, and therefore, corruption and waste have also occurred. The continued existence of corruption and waste is like roundworms in our bodies, sucking our blood all the time. Some corruption cases cause great losses to the people. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Supervisory Committee cracked the collective corruption case of Li Yu-chao, deputy manager of the China Oils and Fats Company's Zhejiang Provincial Company, and others in June of this year. Before liberation, Li Yu-chao worked in Kuomintang bureaucratic enterprises. When Hangzhou was liberated, he concealed, dispersed, and swallowed up the bureaucratic capital property that should have been taken over. After liberation, he colluded with private merchants to embezzle state funds, stealing a total of 1.06 billion yuan of state property.

In many of the corruption incidents that have been discovered in various places, many are caused by collusion with bad elements in the industrial and commercial circles. These kinds of corruption incidents harm the interests of the people the most. For example, the major corruption case in Wuhan, where Cui Ming-qing, chief of the business section of the Municipal Department Store, and others colluded with private merchants, the cadres embezzled more than 140 million yuan, while the private merchants evaded taxes, causing a loss of more than 1.29 billion yuan to the state. Where there are such corrupt elements, the tax revenue work and the entire financial and economic work will suffer great losses.

Wasteful incidents also cause great losses to the country. The East China Textile Administration made an estimate: Shanghai state-owned textile factories, from June 1949 to June of this year, in two years, due to waste of cotton and machinery and materials, substandard products, etc., lost a total of 150 billion yuan. This money could buy a hundred fighter planes. Our country is so big, and there are so many people, that all the large and small wastes add up to be astonishingly large.

Now, the people of the whole country are working hard and trying every means to increase production and practice economy, accumulating wealth for the country bit by bit. If we do not eliminate corruption and waste, it will be like a leaky bucket, pouring water into the bucket, and then leaking all the water into the soil. We say that corruption and waste are the greatest enemies of increasing production and practicing economy, this is a very clear principle.

II. Corruption and Waste Must be Eliminated by the Power of Everyone

Some people think this way: Corruption and waste are hateful, but what can I do? I work in the office every day; work in the factory; work in the fields; or busy with doing business; busy with managing household affairs... how do I know who is corrupting and wasting? How can I manage these things? In fact, if we all wake up, pay attention at all times, and be careful everywhere, no matter how cunning the corrupt elements are, they cannot deceive the eyes of the people. Many of the corruption cases that have been cracked in various places have been reported and exposed by the masses. For example, the corruption case mentioned above in Wuhan, where Cui Ming-qing, chief of the business section of the Municipal Department Store, and others colluded with private merchants, was reported by the employees of the department store. For example, Gu Yu-shang, an employee of the Supreme People's Court, solicited bribes from Liu Feng-xiang, a shareholder of the Beijing private Wen Tongxiang Iron Factory. Liu Feng-xiang's son, Liu Bing-sheng, wrote a letter to the People's Daily exposing Gu Yu-shang's corruption. Zhang Zong-xian, a citizen of Jintang District, Andong City, Liaodong Province, saw his neighbor Shi Ji-qing (a tax bureau employee) accepting gifts from merchants, and reported him at the city's People's Representative Conference. The people who care about the interests of the country and report corrupt elements have been praised by the people. The people of the whole country are worth learning from them.

Similarly, to overcome waste, we must also rely on the joint efforts of everyone. For example, waste in production work and basic construction can be first discovered and proposed by our workers, technicians, and staff. For example, if the warehouse is not well managed and damages state materials, who can know better than our workers who guard the warehouse? We should not let go of even a little bit of small waste, because many small wastes add up to be a lot of waste. For example, we often think that throwing away a few waste papers and wasting one or two taels of grain is nothing. However, a reader named Li Wen from the Northeast Daily suggested collecting used waste paper to make paper. The Northeast People's Government accepted this suggestion and formulated a method for recovering waste paper. In this way, if all the waste paper in the Northeast region can be recovered, it can be used to make 200,000 reams of paper a year. 200,000 reams of paper can buy more than twenty fighter planes. In addition, the Northeast Grain Bureau's laboratory has to take out two taels from each cart of grain as a sample in order to inspect the grain. In the past, this little bit of grain was always thrown away after inspection. This year, after the Northeast launched the movement to increase production and practice economy, they sent someone to collect this grain. Statistics show that 370,000 catties of grain can be saved from waste within a year. If we all use our brains to think of ways to overcome waste, how great this power is!

III. Break Down Concerns, Resolutely Report Corrupt Elements and Expose Waste

In order to turn the work of opposing corruption and waste into everyone's own business, we must overcome some ideological concerns of our own. For example, some people think that "opposing corruption and waste is only the business of the leading organs." The leading organs certainly bear a great responsibility, but it is not enough to rely solely on the power of the leaders. We must all rise up to report corruption, expose waste, and at the same time actively think of ways to prevent these phenomena from happening, so that this work can be done well. Opposing corruption and opposing waste must also fight against bureaucracy. If we encounter some leading cadres who are bureaucratic in the anti-corruption and anti-waste struggle, and ignore or suppress our reports or suggestions, then everyone must not be discouraged, but must resolutely fight. If the lower level does not pay attention, report it to their superiors, as long as it is beneficial to the country and the people, we must strive to pursue it. Some people are afraid that reporting corruption and waste will offend people. This idea is even more wrong. Those who are corrupt and wasteful are not afraid of harming the interests of the people of the whole country, and are not afraid of offending the people of the whole country, so why should we be afraid of offending them? Moreover, for those who have committed minor acts of corruption, exposing them earlier is to help them correct their mistakes and save them from falling into the quagmire. In addition, some people are unwilling to report corrupt elements because they are afraid of retaliation. This is also an unnecessary concern. Those who correctly report corrupt elements have the support of the people of the whole country and the support of the People's Government. Article 18 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates: "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must strictly implement a clean, simple, and revolutionary style of work that serves the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic style of work that is divorced from the masses of the people." Whoever is reported and wants to retaliate will be severely punished by the law.

In order to support the volunteer army in winning greater victories, in order to strengthen our national defense construction and economic construction, everyone should participate in the struggle against corruption, against waste, and against bureaucracy, and defeat the enemies of increasing production and practicing economy! We must make corrupt elements have nowhere to hide, and make waste gradually reduce until it is completely eliminated.

### 人人起来反对贪污浪费

专栏：宣传员讲话

    人人起来反对贪污浪费
    一、贪污浪费是增产节约的敌人
    贪污浪费的行为，是目前开展爱国增产节约运动的最大敌人。大家知道，自从全国解放以来，中国共产党艰苦朴素的作风，已经发生了移风转俗的影响；人民政府是中国自古以来最廉洁、最有效率的政府。但是，我们也不能以为国民党反动统治遗留下来的丑恶东西，今天已经一干二净了。由于我们政府机关和经济机关里，有许多工作人员是在旧社会里做过事的，他们里面的少数人还没有改掉国民党的贪污腐化作风。已发现的犯贪污案的人，有很大一部分是这些人。另外，还有极少数工作人员，他们虽然没有在旧社会里做过事，有的还做了好多年革命工作，可是由于他们存在自私自利的个人主义思想，经不起金钱和物质生活的考验，他们接受了国民党遗留下来的坏作风和资产阶级坏作风的影响，因而也发生了贪污浪费的现象。贪污、浪费现象继续存在，就像我们身体内的蛔虫，时时刻刻在吸我们的血一样。某些贪污案件，给人民的损失是很大的。浙江省人民监察委员会今年六月破获了中国油脂公司浙江省公司副经理李郁超等人的集体贪污案。李郁超解放前在国民党官僚企业里面作事，他在杭州解放时隐匿、分散、侵吞应被接管的官僚资本财产，解放后又勾结私商套用国家资金，共计窃盗国家财产达十亿零六百十三万元。
    在各地已经发现了的贪污事件中，有很多是勾结工商界中的坏分子搞鬼的。这种贪污事件，危害人民的利益也最大。例如武汉市破获的市百货公司业务科长崔明卿等人勾结私商的大贪污案，干部贪污了一亿四千多万元，而私商搞鬼、偷税给国家的损失就有十二亿九千多万元。那儿有这种贪污分子，那儿的税收工作和整个财政经济工作就遭受很大的损失。
    浪费事件给国家的损失也是很大的。华东纺织管理局作了一个估计：上海国营各纺织厂，从一九四九年六月到今年六月的两年中，因为浪费棉花和机物料、产品不合规格等损失，总共有一千五百亿元。这笔钱，可以买一百架战斗机。我们的国家这样大，人这样多，一切大大小小的浪费，加起来就大得惊人。
    现在，全国人民都在辛辛苦苦，千方百计地想办法增产节约，一点一滴地为国家积累财富，如果不把贪污浪费事件消灭掉，那就会造成像漏水的桶一样，把水盛在桶里，又把水都漏到泥土里去了。我们说，贪污浪费是增产节约最大的敌人，这个道理是很明白的。
    二、贪污浪费要靠大家的力量才能肃清
    有的人这样想：贪污浪费是可恨的，可是我有什么办法呢？我每天在办公室里办公；在工厂里做工；在田里干活；或者忙着做买卖；忙着管家务……那儿知道谁在贪污浪费？那儿管得着这些事情呢？事实上，如果我们大家都警醒起来，时时注意，处处留心，贪污分子无论怎样狡猾，是瞒不过人民的眼睛的。各地已经破获的贪污案子，有许多是群众检举、揭发的。例如上面说过的武汉市百货公司业务科长崔明卿等人和私商勾结的贪污案，就是百货公司的职工检举出来的。又如最高人民法院一个职员顾裕尚向北京私营文同祥铁工厂股东刘凤翔等索取贿赂。刘凤翔的儿子刘炳生就写信给人民日报揭发顾裕尚的贪污行为。辽东省安东市金汤区市民张宗显，看到他的邻居石积庆（税务局职员）接受商人的送礼，就在市各界人民代表会上把他检举出来。上述这些关心国家利益，检举贪污分子的人，都受到了人民的称赞。全国人民都值得向他们学习。
    同样，要克服浪费现象，也要依靠我们大家共同的努力。比如，生产工作中和基本建设上的浪费，我们工人、技术人员和职员都可以首先发现并提出克服的办法。又如，那儿的仓库保管得不好，损坏了国家的物资，有谁能比我们看守仓库的工人知道得更清楚呢？我们每个人应该看到一点点小浪费也不要放过，因为许多小浪费加起来就是很大的浪费。比如，我们常常以为扔掉几张废纸，蹧踏一二两粮食不算什么。可是东北日报有位名叫李文的读者，他建议把用过的废纸收集起来造纸。东北人民政府接受了这个建议，订出了废纸收回的办法。这样，东北区内的废纸如果能够全部收回，一年可以用来造纸二十万令。二十万令纸可以买二十多架战斗机。另外，东北粮食局化验室为了检查粮食，要在每一小车粮食里取出二两做样子。这点粮食，过去总是检查之后就丢了。今年东北开展了增产节约运动之后，他们派专人把这些粮食收集起来。统计一年内可使粮食三十七万斤免于浪费。如果我们大家都动脑筋来想办法克服浪费，这力量是多么大啊！
    三、打破顾虑，坚决检举贪污分子和揭发
        浪费现象
    为了把反对贪污浪费的工作变成我们每一个人自己的事情，我们就要克服自己一些思想上的顾虑。比如，有人以为“反对贪污浪费只是领导机关的事”。领导机关当然负有很大的责任，但是，光靠领导上的力量是不够的，必须我们大家起来检举贪污，揭发浪费，同时积极想办法防止这些现象的发生，才能把这个工作作好。反对贪污，反对浪费，还必须和官僚主义作斗争。如果我们在反贪污浪费斗争中，逢上有的领导干部犯了官僚主义，对于我们的检举或建议置之不理或压起来不处理，这时候，大家千万不要泄气，要坚决斗争。下级不重视，报告他的上级，只要对国家和人民有利，一定努力追下去。也有人怕检举揭发贪污浪费，会得罪人。这种想法更不对。贪污、浪费的人不怕损害全国人民的利益，不怕得罪全国人民，我们为什么怕得罪他呢？而且对于贪污情节轻微的人，早些揭露出来，正是帮助他改正错误，挽救他不落泥坑。另外，也有人不愿意检举贪污分子，是怕报复。这也是不必要的顾虑。正确地检举贪污分子的人，有全国人民撑腰，有人民政府撑腰。人民政协共同纲领第十八条明文规定：“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”谁要是被检举了而想报复，会受到法律的严厉制裁。
    为了支援志愿军取得更大的胜利，为了加强我们的国防建设和经济建设，人人都起来参加反对贪污，反对浪费，反对官僚主义的斗争，打倒增产节约的敌人！我们要使贪污分子无处藏身，使浪费现象，逐渐减少直到全部消灭。第四十七期中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会编
