New-style Plows are an Effective Tool for Increasing Yield Per Unit Area
Li Zihua Ma Wenhua

The 1951 comparative experiments between new-style plows and old-style plows demonstrated that new-style plows are an effective tool for increasing yield per unit area. According to preliminary test results from nine provinces and regions using new and old plows to cultivate eleven crops, it was proven that under the same cultivation conditions, plowing with new-style plows increased production by an average of 16.8%, and improved cultivation efficiency by 36.8%. If new-style plows were used nationwide, approximately 7 billion jin of millet could be saved in labor and animal power alone. More importantly, the new-style plow has a great role to play in increasing production. Based on the results of this trial for five crops—cotton, corn, millet, wheat, and sorghum—and the cultivated area of these five crops across the country, the total value of the increased production each year using new-style plows can be converted to 16 billion jin of millet.

In the past year or so of use, new-style plows have aroused widespread enthusiasm among the masses. Various regions have demonstrated through concrete examples and field trials that cultivation with new-style plows is highly efficient, pulverizes the soil well, covers weeds thoroughly, reduces pests and diseases, and promotes good crop growth, with a significant effect on increasing production. The 1949 wheat trial at Keshan Farm in Heilongjiang Province showed that new-style plows (Soviet-style) increased production by 22.3% compared to old-style plows; the 1950 cotton trial in Mujiazhai Village, Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, showed an increase of 17.5% with new-style plows; the corn trial at the Jinghui Farm showed an increase of 7.66% with new-style plows; and the corn trial at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory's experimental farm in 1950 saw a 42.5% increase in yield in the new-plow area. These actual experimental figures demonstrated the effectiveness of new-style plows and increased farmers' confidence in using them. To more broadly compare the impact of new and old-style plows on crop yields and to test the role of new-style plows in agricultural production, the Central Ministry of Agriculture instructed major administrative regions and provinces this spring to direct local agricultural experiment stations and farm implement stations to conduct careful and thorough comparative experiments. By the end of November of this year, most of the trials in various regions had concluded. Here, the materials received are compiled and published as follows:

Comparative Trials of New and Old Plows Under the Same Conditions

These trials compared new-style plows and old-style plows under the same conditions. The new-style plows used in the trials were mostly 7-inch plows manufactured by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, with a few being 5-inch plows, No. 166 plows from the same factory, and 6-inch plows manufactured by the Northwest Farm Implement Factory. The old-style plows were all local old plows; in Gansu and Ningxia, the "two-ox beam plows" were used. In the trials in various regions, both the new-style and old-style plows were pulled by equally strong livestock, and comparisons were made under ordinary customary depths and pulling forces. Other conditions were basically the same. The land for the trials was selected from adjacent plots with the same environment and soil quality, or a large piece of land was divided into two cultivated areas; after plowing, harrowing, compaction, sowing, fertilization, and cultivation, irrigation, etc. were the same.

Comparison of Plowing Efficiency Between New and Old Plows

In this trial, due to the lack of dynamometers, stopwatches, and other tools and instruments, and the fact that the experimental farmers in various regions had not yet mastered this type of scientific technology, precise measurements of the efficiency of new-style plows were generally not made. The speed of the livestock and the pulling force of soil per unit area were not carefully compared. However, one thing we can be certain of is that the masses are very accurate in calculating the plowing area. According to records from various regions, with one person and two animals (donkeys, cattle, horses, mules), a new-style plow can plow an average of 6.76 mu per day, while an old-style plow can only plow an average of 4.94 mu per day. The new-style plow can improve efficiency by 36.8%. According to tensile tests in Beijing, Handan, Daming, and other places, the pulling force of the new-style plow is reduced by an average of 38.7% compared to the old-style plow at the same depth and width.

Comparison of Crop Growth

The scope of this trial was quite extensive. The materials summarized here include the results of a total of forty sets of trials covering nine provinces and regions and eleven crops. These trials, through specially contracted experimental farmers and contact with the local masses, educated the masses with practical examples and increased their trust in new-style plows. Some areas also organized discussions and evaluations by the masses. In the experimental plot of Sun Huanchang, a specially contracted farmer in Liuyi Village, Shandong, the millet in the new-plow area grew tall, the color was deep, and the ears were large. Many people were surprised and asked Sun Huanchang, "How is it that in one piece of land, one side is fed and the other side is not?" After Sun Huanchang's explanation, they truly recognized the benefits of the new-style plow. In the cotton trial in Dongliu Village, Anyi County, Shanxi Province, the seedlings in the new and old plow areas did not have much difference at the beginning due to the dry weather and uneven emergence of cotton seedlings. At this time, some people said, "The new plow is useless; the cadres are just selling hot air." By July, the cotton plants in the new-plow area were 50 cm tall (100 cm equals 1 meter, 1 meter equals 3 Chinese feet), with an average of 20 cotton bolls per plant, and the leaves were dark green; however, the cotton plants in the old-plow area were only 43 cm tall, with an average of 17 cotton bolls per plant, and the cotton leaves were yellow and listless. The visiting masses all said in unison: "After all, it's much better than our plow (referring to the old plow)!" In this trial, field observations were made many times in various regions, and measurements and comparisons were made of the strength of seedlings, the height of plants, and the size of ears. From the perspective of crop growth, the seedlings in the area cultivated with new-style plows were neat, vigorous, tall, and had large ears; in the area cultivated with old-style plows, the seedlings grew unevenly, the leaves were yellow and withered, and pests and diseases were more serious. In the tobacco trial in Pangzhuang Village, Xuchang, Henan, the field observation record on August 13 stated: the seedlings in the new-plow area were neat, with few weeds, large leaves, and tall plants. The tallest plant was 144.7 cm, and the longest tobacco leaf was 81.2 cm; the seedlings in the old-plow area were of varying heights, with more weeds, the tallest plant was 129.5 cm, and the longest leaf was 71.1 cm. In the millet trial in Tai'an County, Shandong Province, the field observation on August 20 showed that the stalks in the new-plow area were 154 cm tall and the ears were 17.6 cm long, while the stalks in the old-plow area were 141 cm tall and the ears were 17.4 cm long. In the wheat trial in Xieli Zhao Village, Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, the average plant height in the new-plow area was 88.7 cm, the ear length was 5.8 cm, the ear had 9 pairs of nodes, the number of grains per ear was 36, the weight per 100 grains was 8.34 cm (500 cm equals 1 Chinese catty), the effective tillers were 5.3, the number of fibrous roots was 18.5, and the length was uniform; the average plant height in the old-plow area was only 62.3 cm, the ear length was 4.3 cm, the ear had 7.7 pairs of nodes, the number of grains per ear was 24.5, the weight per 100 grains was 6.15 cm, the effective tillers were 2.3, and the number of fibrous roots was 14.3, and the length of the fibrous roots was uneven.

Comparison of Yields

The yield figures were mostly obtained from actual harvesting and weighing. For example, in the cotton trial in Anyi, Shanxi, the amount of cotton picked each day was recorded. In the tobacco leaf trial in Xuchang, Henan, the number of stalks was recorded and the weight was weighed separately for each harvest. In this cotton trial, there were four groups, and the trial areas included Shanxi, Henan, and Beijing; the average yield of seed cotton per mu in the land cultivated with new-style plows was 234 jin, and the average yield of seed cotton per mu in the land cultivated with old-style plows was 210.5 jin. The new-style plows increased production by 11.1%. In the corn trial, there were a total of six groups, and the trial areas included Pingyuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Beijing; the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with new-style plows was 505.5 jin, and the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with old-style plows was 463.1 jin. The new-style plows increased production by 9.1%. In the millet trial, there were a total of thirteen groups, and the trial areas included Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Beijing; the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with new-style plows was 292 jin, and the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with old-style plows was 254.5 jin. The new-style plows increased production by 14.7%. In the sorghum trial, there were a total of five groups, and the trial areas included Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan; the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with new-style plows was 333.6 jin, and the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with old-style plows was 275.4 jin. The new-style plows increased production by 21.1%. In the wheat trial, there were a total of five groups, and the trial areas included Shanxi and Shaanxi; the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with new-style plows was 198.5 jin, and the average yield per mu in the land cultivated with old-style plows was 157.2 jin. The new-style plows increased production by 26.3%.

The average increase in yield for the five crops of cotton, corn, sorghum, millet, and wheat cultivated with new-style plows is 16.4%.

In addition, the results of trials on six crops including soybeans, naked oats, rice, tobacco, hyacinth beans, and foxtail millet in Shaanxi, Chahar, Ningxia, Henan, and Gansu showed that new-style plows can increase production by an average of 6.32%.

From an overall perspective, in this trial of forty groups, the number of groups that increased production using new-style plows was thirty-six, and the number of groups that decreased production was four. Calculated as an average based on the number of trial groups, the total average increase in production with new-style plows is 16.8%.

Why Cultivation with New-Style Plows Can Increase Production

First, new-style plows can improve soil fertility. The most important condition for maintaining the fertility of the soil is to form and maintain a granular structure in the soil. The so-called granular structure of the soil refers to the soil aggregates of various sizes and shapes formed by the combination of soil particles. This granular structure is mixed with humus colloid, allowing many micropores to retain nutrients and absorb water; and ensuring the propagation of "aerobic bacteria" (bacteria that can only survive in the presence of sufficient air), which decompose organic matter into inorganic compounds to supply plants for absorption. The main function of plowing is to form a granular structure in the cultivated layer of the soil. New-style plows can achieve this in terms of turning, breaking, and loosening the soil. New-style plows have appropriate turning and crushing actions, which can break up large clods and form granules. The moldboard and share of the old-style plow do not have a certain curvature, which causes greater damage to the granular structure of the soil, and at the same time cannot form a granular structure in the soil very well, so the fertility of the soil will be reduced, and the crop growth will be poor.

Second, new-style plows cultivate the soil to a consistent depth, leaving no ridges. The share point of the old-style plow is triangular. The land cultivated by the old-style plow has ridges at the bottom, and the cross-section is serrated. For land cultivated to a width of 5.5 inches, the tooth shape is as high as 1.5 inches. The depth of ordinary old-style plows is generally around 5 inches from the bottom of the furrow to the surface. After harrowing, the distance between the top of the ridge and the surface (that is, the depth at the ridge) is actually only 3.5 inches. At the same time, the soil ridge part does not retain as much moisture as the bottom of the furrow, and the retention time is shorter. In this way, the water-soluble inorganic nutrients in the soil ridge part are not as much as in the bottom of the furrow, and plants growing in the ridge part will grow poorly due to difficult root development and insufficient nutrients. This is why the seedlings in the land cultivated with old-style plows generally appear uneven.

Third, new-style plows can reduce weeds and mitigate pests. New-style plows plow deeper and cover the soil more tightly, which can bury weeds, weed seeds, plant remains, pests, etc. deep in the soil, and expose the eggs and larvae of underground pests, which die after being exposed to the sun and frost. Old-style plows cannot properly turn and crush the soil, the weed cover is not tight, and pests are not easily killed. This is why there are more weeds, poorer crop growth, and more severe pest damage in the land cultivated with old-style plows. (Attached pictures)

    新式犁是提高单位面积产量的有效工具
    李自华    马文华
    一九五一年新式犁和旧式犁的比较试验，说明了新式犁是提高单位面积产量的有效工具。根据九个省区用新犁旧犁耕地种植十一种作物的初步试验结果，证明在同样的栽培条件下，用新式犁耕作比用旧式犁耕作平均可增加产量百分之十六点八，并且可以提高耕作效率百分之三十六点八。如果在全国范围内全部改用新式犁，那么，仅人工畜工一项，就可以节省小米约七十亿斤。更值得注意的是新式犁对于增产的伟大作用。按这次对棉花、玉米、谷子、小麦、高粱五种作物试验的结果和这五种作物在全国各地的栽培面积计算，用新式犁耕作，这五种作物每年增产的总值，可折合小米一百六十亿斤。
    新式犁在最近一年多的使用过程中，已引起广大群众的热烈爱好。各地区通过各种具体事例和实地试验，证明用新式犁耕作，效能高，碎土好，盖草严，病虫害少，作物生长良好，对提高产量有显著效能。一九四九年黑龙江省克山农场小麦试验结果，用新式犁（苏联式）耕作，较旧式犁增产百分之二十二点三；一九五零年陕西省武功县穆家寨棉花试验，用新式犁增产百分之十七点五；泾惠农场的玉米试验，用新式犁增产百分之七点六六；一九五零年华北农业机械总厂试验农场的玉米，新犁区增产量达到百分之四十二点五。这些实际试验数字，表现了新式犁的效用，增加了农民使用新式犁的信心。为了更广泛地比较新式犁和旧式犁对作物产量的影响，并测验新式犁在农业生产中所起的作用，中央农业部今年春季曾指示各大行政区及各省，转令各地农事试验场、农具站，进行审慎周密的比较试验。到本年十一月底为止，各地的试验已大部结束。这里就已收到的材料整理发表如下：
    新旧犁在同样条件下进行比较
    这次试验是在同样的条件下，用新式犁和旧式犁进行比较。试验所用的新式犁，绝大部分是用华北农业机械总厂制造的七吋犁，也有少数是这个厂制造的五吋犁、一六六号犁和西北农具厂制造的六吋犁。旧式犁都是用的当地的旧犁，在甘肃、宁夏是用的“二牛抬杠犁”。各地试验时，新式犁和旧式犁都是用同样强壮的牲口，在普通的习惯深度和拉力下进行比较。其他各种条件基本上也都是相同的。试验的土地是选择环境相同土质一样的邻近地块，或将一大块地分成两个耕作区；耕地以后，耙、镇压、播种、施肥、中耕、灌溉等情况都相同。
        新旧犁耕地效率的比较
    这次试验，因为缺乏拉力仪、马表及其他工具和仪器，各地试验农户对这一类的科学技术也还不会掌握，所以对于新式犁的效率，大都没有作精密的测量。如牲口行进的速度，土壤单位断面的拉力，都没有作仔细的比较。但是有一点我们可以相信，就是群众对耕地面积的测算是很确实的。根据各地的纪录，用一个人工两头牲口（驴、牛、马、骡都有），新式犁平均每天可耕六点七六亩，旧式犁平均每天只能耕四点九四亩。新式犁可提高效率百分之三十六点八。又根据在北京、邯郸、大名等地的拉力试验，新式犁耕同样深度，同样宽度，拉力比旧式犁平均减轻百分之三十八点七。
        作物生长情况的比较
    这次试验的范围是相当广泛的。现在所总结的材料，包括九个省区，十一种作物，共计四十组试验的结果。这些试验，通过特约试验农户，和当地群众取得联系，用实际事例教育了群众，提高了群众对新式犁的信任。有些地区还组织群众进行了讨论和评议。山东留衣庄特约农户孙焕昌的试验地，新犁区的谷子长得高，颜色又深，穗又大，很多群众都很奇怪，问孙焕昌说：“怎么在一块地里，一边喂了，一边没喂？”经过孙焕昌的解释，他们真正认识了新式犁的好处。山西省安邑县东留村的棉花试验，开始时因为天气干旱，棉苗出土不齐，新旧犁区的苗株，并没有多大区别。这时有些人就说：“新犁不顶事，干部尽卖嘴。”到了七月间，新犁区的棉株有五十公分高（一百公分等于一公尺，一公尺合三市尺），平均每株有二十个棉桃，叶色黑绿；可是旧犁区的棉株，这时只有四十三公分高，平均每株只有十七个棉桃，棉叶发黄，萎靡不振。参观的群众都一致地说：“到底比咱那犁
    （指旧犁）强得多哩！”这次各地的试验，大都作过多次的田间观察，并且就幼苗的强弱、植株的高矮以及穗的大小，作了测量和比较。从作物的生长情况来看，新式犁耕作的地区，幼苗整齐，生长旺盛，株高，穗大；旧式犁耕作的地区，苗株生长高低不齐，叶色黄萎，病虫害也比较严重。河南许昌庞庄村的烟草试验，根据八月十三日的田间观察记载：新犁区苗株整齐，杂草少，叶大株高，最高的一株有一百四十四点七公分，最长的烟叶八十一点二公分；旧犁区苗株高低不一，杂草较多，最高株一百二十九点五公分，最长的叶七十一点一公分。山东省泰安县的谷子试验，在八月二十日田间观察时，新犁区秆高一百五十四公分，穗长十七点六公分，旧犁区秆高一百四十一公分，穗长十七点四公分。陕西省泾阳县斜里赵村的小麦试验，新犁区平均株高八十八点七公分，穗长五点八公分，穗节九对，每穗粒数三十六粒，每百粒重量八点三四公分（五百公分等于一市斤），有效分蘖五点三条，须根数十八点五根，长短整齐；旧犁区平均株高仅六十二点三公分，穗长四点三公分，穗节七点七对，每穗粒数二十四点五粒，每百粒重量六点一五公分，有效分蘖二点三条，须根数十四点三根，而且须根长短不齐。
    产量的比较
    产量数字的记录，绝大部分是从实际收获秤量得来。如山西安邑的棉花试验，摘花量每天都有记载。河南许昌的烟叶试验，每次收获，都曾分别记录秆数，秤出重量。这次棉花试验，共有四组，试验地区包括山西、河南、北京三地；新式犁耕作的地每亩平均产籽棉二百三十四斤，旧犁耕作的地每亩平均产籽棉二百一十点五斤，新式犁增产百分之十一点一。玉米试验，共计六组，试验地区包括平原、陕西、山西和北京；新式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量五百零五点五斤，旧式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量四百六十三点一斤，新式犁增产百分之九点一。谷子试验共计十三组，试验地区，包括河南、山东、山西、平原、北京等地；新式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量二百九十二斤，旧式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量二百五十四点五斤，新式犁增产百分之十四点七。高粱试验共计五组，试验地区包括山西、陕西、河南等地；新式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量三百三十三点六斤，旧式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量二百七十五点四斤，新式犁增产百分之二十一点一。小麦试验共计五组，试验地区包括山西和陕西；新式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量一百九十八点五斤，旧式犁耕作的地每亩平均产量一百五十七点二斤，新式犁增产百分之二十六点三。
    以上棉花、玉米、高粱、谷子、小麦等五种作物用新式犁耕作的平均增产量是百分之十六点四。
    此外，大豆、莜麦、稻、烟草，扁豆、糜子等六种作物，在陕西、察哈尔、宁夏、河南、甘肃等地的试验结果，新式犁平均可增加产量百分之六点三二。
    从总的情况来看，在这次四十组试验中，使用新式犁增产的占三十六个，减产的占四个。按试验的组数为单位来平均计算，新式犁总平均增产量是百分之十六点八。
    为什么用新式犁耕作能够增产
    第一，新式犁耕地可以增进土壤的肥力。使土壤经常保持肥沃的一个最重要的条件，就是使土壤形成和保持团粒结构。所谓土壤团粒结构，就是土壤中由土粒结合而成的各种大小不同形状的土团。这种团粒结构混杂着腐植质胶状体，使许多微气孔能保持养料和吸收水分；并保证“好气性细菌”
    （这种细菌在空气充足时才能生存）的繁殖，使这种细菌分解有机质成为无机化合物，供给植物吸收。耕地的主要作用，就是要使土壤的耕作层里形成团粒结构。用新式犁耕地，在翻土、碎土和松土方面都能作到这一点。新式犁有适当的翻碎作用，可使大土块分碎形成团粒。旧式犁的犁铧和犁镜，因为没有一定的曲度，对土壤的团粒结构破坏较大，同时也不能很好地使土壤形成团粒结构，所以土壤的肥沃性就会减低，作物生长情况就会不好。
    第二，新式犁耕地，深度一致，不留沟埂。旧式犁的铧尖是三角形。经过旧式犁耕作的土地，底部都有沟埂，横断面呈锯齿状。耕宽五寸五分的地，齿形高达一寸五分。普通旧式犁所耕的深度，从沟底至地面，大都在五寸左右，经耙平以后，土埂顶部和地面的距离（即土埂处的深度）实际上只有三寸五分。同时土埂部对于水分的保持，也不及沟底部多，保持的时间也较短。这样，土埂部分的水溶性无机质养料，也没有沟底多，生长在土埂部位的植株，就会因为根部发展困难和养料不足而生长不良。这就是为什么旧式犁耕地的苗株，普遍呈现高低不齐的原因。
    第三，新式犁耕地能减少杂草，减轻虫害。新式犁耕得深，盖土严，可以把杂草、杂草的种子、植物的残骸、害虫等深埋在土壤里，并且把地下害虫的卵和幼虫暴露出来，经日晒冰冻而死亡。旧式犁不能适当地翻土和碎土，盖草不能严实，害虫不易死亡。这就是旧式犁耕作的地杂草多、作物生长不良、虫害较重的原因。（附图片）
