    Xu Penglai, Treasurer of Shijiazhuang Water Company, Colluded with Unscrupulous Merchants to Embezzle and Steal Company Equipment and Was Dismissed and Brought to Justice

    Xu Penglai, treasurer of the Shijiazhuang Water Company in Hebei Province, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to embezzle and steal company equipment and has been dismissed from his post and brought to justice.

    Xu Penglai lived a corrupt life on weekdays, satisfying his shameless desires by embezzling and stealing company equipment. This spring, when the company purchased 5,000 catties of cement, Xu Penglai colluded with iron merchant Liu Wanyin to issue false receipts, embezzling more than one million yuan, of which Liu Wanyin received a share of 100,000 yuan. In April, Xu Penglai stole a batch of the company's "elbows" and other equipment, which Li Tianjin (a worker of the company) delivered to Liu Wanyin for sale. Xu Penglai received 1.4 million yuan, Li received a share of 250,000 yuan, and Liu received a share of 80,000 yuan. In July, Xu Penglai stole seven sets of the company's "dies," which he handed over to Liu Wanyin for resale to the company. Xu Penglai received 3.6 million yuan, of which 200,000 yuan was given to Liu. The company equipment stolen by Xu Penglai, which was taken out by Li Tianjin, included more than 5,870 catties of mixed millet stored in Liu Wanyin's home; more than 2,800 catties of mixed millet stored in the home of iron merchant Liu Jianzhang; more than 1,600 catties of mixed millet that had been stolen and "privately stored" in the company; and six dozen "saw blades" that had been stolen and resold to the company, resulting in more than 260,000 yuan; in addition, he also stole five "dies," two "bead plates," and one "iron joint door," etc. The above-mentioned stolen and sold equipment totaled more than 22,000 catties of mixed millet. The accomplice Li Tianjin had also independently stolen iron pipes, flour sacks, and other items for sale and squandered the money. For example, during the Longquanchi bathhouse project, he stole more than 30 parts and stored them in Liu Jianzhang's home.

    Xu Penglai has now been dismissed from his post and handed over to the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court for punishment according to law. The relevant criminals have also been sent to the People's Court for punishment.
