    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. The South Korean People's Guerrillas, with the active support of the broad masses of people, are constantly striking blows against the American-Syngman Rhee bandit gangs with heroic and resourceful struggles. The Jiri Mountain People's Guerrillas, active in the areas around Jeolla South Province and Gyeongsang South Province, liberated the counties of Jangheung and Gwangyang on September 29th and October 5th respectively, annihilating six small teams of puppet police. A unit of the People's Guerrillas annihilated several companies of puppet police in Jeolla North Province on October 6th. The People's Guerrillas active in Chungcheong South Province cleared out hundreds of reactionaries and puppet police in the Nonsan County area on October 9th. A unit of the People's Guerrillas attacked Okcheon County in Chungcheong North Province on October 19th, burning over twenty rooms of enemy military supplies and achieving the brilliant result of annihilating over two companies of puppet police.
    The guerrillas who operate around Gangneung and Samcheok on the east coast frequently use scattered attacks to achieve the goal of annihilating the enemy. Many guerrilla detachments active in Jeolla North and South Provinces have organized joint forces, penetrating into the Mokpo area, and constantly achieving victories in surprise attacks on enemy strongholds. They not only tie down many enemy troops in the enemy's rear, but also have begun to continuously shoot down and damage enemy aircraft in anti-aircraft fire.
    The heroic struggle of the People's Guerrillas has gained the enthusiastic support of the South Korean people under the iron heel rule of the American-Syngman Rhee bandit gangs. The broad masses of people usually risk danger to supply the guerrillas with food and clothing, and when necessary, they step forward to support the guerrillas in battle. Many young people from various places have flocked to join the guerrillas. The names of the People's Guerrilla captains are respectfully and widely spread among the local men, women, and children.

    朝鲜南部人民游击队
    连续打击美李匪军
    智异山游击队解放长兴等县城
   【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜南部人民游击队在广大人民的积极支援下，正以英勇机智的斗争不断予美李匪帮以打击。活跃在全罗南道和庆尚南道一带地区的智异山人民游击队，曾于九月二十九日及十月五日先后解放了长兴、光阳两个县城，全歼伪警六个小队。人民游击队某部在十月六日围歼了全罗北道好几个中队的伪警察。活跃在忠清南道的人民游击队在十月九日肃清了论山郡一带的数百名反动分子和伪警察。人民游击队某部在十月十九日袭击忠清北道的沃川郡，烧毁了敌人的二十余间军用物资，取得了歼灭伪警两个中队以上的光辉战果。
    出没在东海岸江陵、三陟一带的游击队即常以分散的袭击，达到歼敌的目的。活动在全罗南北道的许多游击支队组织了联合部队，深入到木浦一带，不断取得了奇袭敌人据点的胜利。他们不但在敌人后方牵制着敌人的许多兵力，而且开始在对空射击中不断地击落、击伤敌机。
    人民游击队的英勇斗争，获得了在美李匪帮的铁蹄统治下的朝鲜南部人民的热烈支持。广大人民平时冒着危险以粮食和衣物接济游击队，必要时就挺身而出支援游击队作战。各地很多的青年纷纷投奔游击队。人民游击队队长的名字都被当地的男女老少尊敬地广泛地传诵着。
