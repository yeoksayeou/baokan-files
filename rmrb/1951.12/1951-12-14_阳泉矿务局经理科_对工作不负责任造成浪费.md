To the Editor:

    The Yangquan Mining Bureau's Managerial Section transferred 151 coal cars to the Third Mine two months ago. Recently, they transferred these same coal cars, untouched, from the Third Mine to the Xiaonankeng Mine. These coal cars were not used at all, resulting in a wasted freight charge equivalent to 1,812 catties of millet. Last year, the Third Mine excavated 938.2 square meters of sandstone, and the Mining Bureau's Managerial Section intended for the Third Mine to use it. However, because the cost of this sandstone was too high, exceeding the market price, the Third Mine, fearing it would affect their costs, suggested that the Mining Bureau's Managerial Section calculate the price according to market rates. At that time, the Mining Bureau's Managerial Section, failing to consider the overall interests and harboring a departmentalist fear of losing money, left the sandstone unused for nearly a year. Over the year, most of the sandstone deteriorated into small pieces due to sun and rain, rendering most of it unusable, resulting in a loss of 580.2 square meters. Calculated at the original price of 14 catties of millet for labor per square meter, the 580.2 square meters of sandstone are equivalent to over 8,120 catties of millet. The total loss from these two items amounts to over 9,930 catties of millet. I believe this loss could have been avoided, and the Yangquan Mining Bureau should investigate responsibility.

    阳泉矿务局经理科
    对工作不负责任造成浪费
    编辑同志：山西阳泉矿务局经理科在两个月前，调拨一百五十一辆煤车到三矿，最近又把这些辆煤车原封不动地由三矿调拨到小南坑矿。这些煤车丝毫没有使用，徒然损失了一千八百十二斤小米的运费。去年，三矿开下沙石头九百三十八点二平方公尺，矿务局经理科准备叫三矿使用。但因这些沙石头成本太高，超过了市价，三矿怕影响成本，所以向矿务局经理科提出意见，要求按照市价计算。当时，矿务局经理科不从整体利益出发，有怕赔钱的本位主义思想，结果把这些沙石头放了将近一年没有用。一年来，大部分沙石头因日晒雨淋成了小石块，大部分不能使用了，共损失了五百八十点二平方公尺。按原价每平方公尺的工资小米十四斤计算，五百八十点二平方公尺的沙石头折合小米八千一百二十余斤。这两项损失共达九千九百三十余斤小米。我认为这种损失是可以避免的，阳泉矿务局应追查责任。　张为耘　姚步堂
