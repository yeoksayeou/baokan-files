Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 5th: At the Korean armistice talks on the 3rd, our side put forward two supplementary proposals regarding the third agenda item. We proposed that during the armistice period, neither side should bring any military forces or weapons and ammunition into Korea from outside Korea under any pretext, and we proposed that both sides invite neutral countries to form a supervisory body responsible for conducting necessary inspections of the aforementioned proposals at rear ports agreed upon by both sides. For the past two days, our representatives have answered the 40 written questions raised by the other side regarding our principled proposals in detail in writing, and have provided detailed explanations on the questions raised by the other side in the subcommittee. However, at the subcommittee meeting on the 5th, the other side's representatives still avoided expressing their attitude towards our principled proposals and repeatedly raised questions that our side had already answered fully, thereby delaying time. Our representatives made it clear at the subcommittee meeting on the 5th that the other side's intention in doing so was solely to delay the negotiations. If the other side continues to use this tactic, then the responsibility for delaying the armistice negotiations rests entirely with the other side.

    美方避免对我建议表示态度
    我指责美方拖延谈判
    【新华社开城五日电】在三日朝鲜停战谈判会议上，我方提出对于第三项议程的两项补充建议，提议双方在停战期间不应从朝鲜境外以任何藉口运进任何军事力量与武器弹药，并提议双方邀请中立国家组成监察机构，负责到双方同意的后方口岸对于上述提议进行必要的视察。两天以来，我方代表详细地书面答复了对方对于我方原则建议所提出的四十个书面问题，并在小组委员会上就对方所提出的问题进行了详细的解释。但对方代表在五日的小组会上，却仍然避免对我方原则建议表示态度，而反复提出已经我方充分答复了的问题，拖延时间。我方代表在五日的小组会上明白指出：对方这种做法其目的仅在于拖延谈判，如果对方继续使用这种技俩，则拖延停战谈判的责任全在对方。
