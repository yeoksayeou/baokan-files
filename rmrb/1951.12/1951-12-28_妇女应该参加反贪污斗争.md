    Women Should Participate in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    To the Editor: I believe that we women should actively participate in the anti-corruption struggle. Comrade He Yuzhen, a representative of the women's circles in Shanghai, said it well: "It is incorrect to think that corruption has nothing to do with women, because wives always know about the corrupt acts of their corrupt husbands. Therefore, women must participate in the anti-corruption movement and report corrupt husbands." This is completely correct and necessary. A small number of women, due to the influence of old society habits—love of vanity and extravagance—have not completely changed, so they always hope that their husbands' "income" is as high as possible. This cannot but be one of the factors that contribute to the corruption of some people. Therefore, this group of women should carry out self-reform and further help their corrupt husbands to reform. As for the family members of non-cadres and non-businessmen, they should also fulfill their responsibility to supervise and report corrupt elements at all times and in all places.

    We women should, under the leadership of the local women's federations, strive for the anti-corruption struggle. In the anti-corruption movement, let us take a step further in our thinking. I am willing to work hand in hand with my sisters! Huang Lianghuai

    妇女应该参加反贪污斗争
    编辑同志：我认为我们妇女应该积极参加反贪污斗争。上海市妇女界代表何宇珍同志说得好：“认为贪污和妇女没有关系是不正确的，因为，许多贪污的丈夫的贪污事实，妻子总是会晓得的。因此妇女一定要参加反贪污运动，并且要检举贪污的丈夫。”这是完全正确的、必要的。有很少数妇女，由于旧社会带来的作风——爱虚荣、铺张浪费——还没有完全改掉，所以她们总希望丈夫的“收入”越多越好。这不能不是促成某些人贪污的因素之一。所以，这一部分妇女应该进行自我改造，并进一步帮助贪污的丈夫改造。至于非干部的家属们、非商人的家属们，也要随时随地尽监督、检举贪污分子的责任。
    我们妇女应该在各地妇女联合会的领导下，为反贪污斗争而努力。在反贪污运动中，使我们在思想上更提高一步。我愿意和姊妹们携手并进！黄亮怀
