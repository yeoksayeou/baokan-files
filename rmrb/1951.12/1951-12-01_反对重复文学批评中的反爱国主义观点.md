    Oppose Repeating Anti-Patriotic Views in Literary Criticism
    *Pravda* Editorial
    Editor's Note: This *Pravda* editorial criticizes the anti-patriotic erroneous views of Soviet literary critic A. Gurvich. A. Gurvich's essay "The Power of Positive Examples," published in the ninth issue of *Novy Mir*, is filled with anti-patriotic views of the great heritage of Russian classical literature, ignoring the driving role of many great works from Chernyshevsky to Gorky in Russian history, believing that "great Russian writers did not create fully valuable characters with the power of positive examples." In analyzing and evaluating positive character images in Soviet literature, A. Gurvich also dismisses the Soviet positive character images that are now cited as excellent examples by people all over the world; he attempts to show that, apart from Azaev's "Far from Moscow," there are no outstanding or meaningful works in Soviet literature; he attempts to diminish and belittle the achievements of Soviet literature. A. Gurvich's arguments on certain aesthetic issues are also wrong, such as reducing the object of art merely to some abstract "inner world of man."
    This *Pravda* editorial strictly criticizes these erroneous arguments. The editorial forcefully points out that these errors and shortcomings show that the recurrence of anti-patriotic views in literary criticism is caused by taking a non-caring attitude towards Soviet literature.
    This *Pravda* editorial is well worth our attention. It is very enlightening for our literary criticism work. We should pay attention to strengthening vigilance in our work to prevent similar anti-patriotic ideological tendencies criticized in this editorial. In some of our critical articles, there are erroneous arguments that attempt to obliterate the brilliant achievements of our classical literary heritage and new worker-peasant-soldier literature. Although these arguments are individual, they should still attract our attention. At the same time, from a positive point of view, we should further strengthen our understanding and research of our great cultural heritage. This editorial also gives us a great help in this regard.
    The important task before literary criticism is: to study the issues of socialist realism, to promote the prosperity of Soviet literature by various methods, and to improve its role in communist education. Every major attempt to theoretically explain the important issues of Soviet literature, every speech that discusses the content-rich creations of Soviet writers, receives the concern and approval of our readers.
    The ninth issue of *Novy Mir* published A. Gurvich's essay "The Power of Positive Examples," which discusses the important issue of creating positive character images in art and literature.
    In the first part of his essay, the critic affirms that great Russian writers did not create fully valuable character images with the power of positive examples. If there were "undeniable positive images," they were "almost all women." Yes, these images—according to the critic himself—"expressed their virtues only in one relationship...in love." If we are to believe the critic, then Russian reality did not give writers enough material to create images of "the most advanced figures of the era," and the protagonists of Russian reality were all types of "lazy people."
    Such is the first argument put forward by this critic.
    The task of the second part of the essay is to point out how to solve the problem of creating positive character images in Soviet literature. If the critic in the first part of the essay tried his best to cite classical literature in its entirety to support his conclusions, then in the second part—the main part of the essay—he actually only took one work from the entire Soviet literature—V. Azaev's novel "Far from Moscow." When comparing Azaev's book with other works of art, Gurvich asserted: "This novel is the most important, the pivotal position on the labor front in Soviet literature today. It has opened up an epic avenue leading to the great communist construction."
    Such is the second argument put forward by this critic.
    The critic bases his assertions on the aesthetic requirements that determine the method of literary analysis, saying: "The aesthetic form of consciousness has its own object. Its unique and all-encompassing object is the inner world of man." Whether there is some "reserve force of the human soul" in a work is the main criterion of artistry.
    Such is the third argument put forward by this critic. When discussing Russian classical literature, the author asserted that Russian literature did not seem to be able to include the advanced figures of the time into its main protagonists. According to his opinion, Russian classical literature "depicted individual characteristics of new figures in various forms, often distortedly, but the complete character was never grasped by the writer's hand."
    Anyone who knows a little about Russian literature understands that this critic's argument is contrary to historical truth. Belinsky, more than a hundred years ago, wrote in his essay "Notes on Ideas and Russian Literature": "For our society, literature is even a living source of realistic moral concepts." And in his famous letter to Gogol, he proudly said that Russian society "regards Russian writers as its only leaders, the protectors and saviors who escape Russian autocracy"...
    Who doesn't know that advanced Russian writers developed noble patriotism and liberation ideals. And isn't it clear that these ideals are specifically expressed in certain images? It is very important that when Lenin talked about the role of advanced revolutionary theory, in 1902, he mentioned "the world significance that Russian literature currently has..."
    The advanced Russian writers, who were very sensitive to the demands of life, created a series of positive character images in their works, and the noble examples of these characters actively influenced the progressive forces of society and educated these forces. We cannot use the same scale to measure the characters of our Soviet era to measure the characters of the past. Living in specific historical conditions put forward the typical figures of a certain advanced era. Only from the perspective of historical conditions can we correctly judge the characters in one or another literature. In the works of Griboyedov [1] and Pushkin, the Decembrist writers, in the works of Turgenev, Ostrovsky, Herzen, Chernyshevsky, Nekrasov and many other writers, the positive figures of the time were described.
    And how does the author of the "Novy Mir" essay view Russian literature? He actually even denies the power of the image of the revolutionary Rakhmetov as an example. According to the critic's argument, Rakhmetov, the protagonist of Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?"—"is not only an interlude, but also a forcibly added character... He did not participate in practical actions, that is, he did not participate in the movement of life itself"... In other words, the conclusion is that Rakhmetov is not a living, not a real character.
    In fact, the image of Rakhmetov embodies the characteristics of a professional revolutionary trained by the Russian revolutionary democratic movement in the 1860s. Everyone knows how highly Lenin evaluated Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?" This book educated generations of proletarian revolutionaries. "...Never has a literary work," Dimitrov wrote, "influenced my revolutionary education as strongly as Chernyshevsky's novel... What I particularly loved was Rakhmetov. I made it my goal to be a courageous and persevering person, to temper my will and character in the struggle against difficulties and hardships, and to subordinate my personal life to the interests of the great cause of the working class—in a word, to be a flawless protagonist of Chernyshevsky as I imagined."
    Even in Chernyshevsky's creation, who, as Lenin called him, was good at realizing the revolutionary ideals of the peasants through all obstacles, the critic did not find a clear typical image of a positive hero. To avoid talking about this outstanding achievement of classical literature—is to disregard the revolutionary tradition of the Russian people embodied in classical literature, a tradition that every Soviet person cherishes.
    The Russian people, who were the first in the world to complete the socialist revolution and build a socialist society, have the right to be proud of their revolutionary traditions. They also deserve to be proud of Russia's classical literature, which stands out for its advanced ideas in world literature.
    Stalin pointed out: "The leaders of the revolutionary workers all over the world are tirelessly studying the most educational history of the Russian working class, the past of the working class, the past of Russia, and at the same time know that besides the reactionary Russia, there was also a revolutionary Russia, the Russia of Radishchev [2] and Chernyshevsky, Seryakov [3] and Ulyanov, Khalturin [4] and Alekseyev [5]. These will plant (cannot but plant!) in the hearts of the Russian workers the revolutionary national pride that can move mountains and create miracles."
    Realistic Russian literature—in its excellent works, correctly portrayed many characteristics of the activists of revolutionary Russia. Socialist realism literature—is a new stage in the development of artistic creation that is inextricably linked to the proletarian revolutionary movement and socialist construction. On the one hand, Soviet literature is qualitatively superior to the literature of critical realism, and on the other hand, it inherits and creatively develops the excellent traditions of Russian and world classical literature.
    The creator of socialist realism literature, the genius writer Gorky, highly evaluated the noble tradition of Russian classical literature, creatively developed this tradition, and increased the honor of our motherland's literature. Even before the October Revolution, he saw heroes in the proletariat—the transformers of the world—and made them the central figures of his works. Gorky was the first in world literature to create, with outstanding artistic power, the image of the Russian revolutionary worker, the fighter for freedom, the builder of new life.
    Therefore, the fact that the author of the article "The Power of Positive Examples," when studying the problems he raised in the historical plan, said nothing about Gorky's artistic creation, the great social significance of the immortal image of the revolutionary warrior he created with great positive exemplary power, cannot but encounter resolute opposition.
    From this, it seems that Gurvich is dragging anti-patriotic views into the great heritage of Russian classical writers in his essay, trying to imagine Soviet writers as strangers. How does this critic analyze and evaluate the positive character images in Soviet literature?
    In his essay, the critic avoids talking about all the richest experiences of Soviet writers in creating positive character images. As a result, it seems that in the development of Russian literature, between Chernyshevsky and Azaev, there was neither Gorky, nor Mayakovsky, Serafimovich, Alexei Tolstoy, Sholokhov, Fadeev, Ostrovsky, Gladkov and other people's works, nor a large army of Soviet writers who created the positive character images of our time. The author of the essay actually does not recognize such images, such as Chapayev in Fumanov's novel "Chapayev", Davidov in Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned", Levinson and Morezko in Fadeev's "The Rout", Telegin in A. Tolstoy's "The Road to Calvary", Zhdalkin in Panfilov's "Bruski", Vorobayev in Pavlenko's "Happiness", Sergei Tutarinov in Babayevsky's "The Golden Star Knight", Izvekov in Fedin's novel, and many other character images.
    But how does this critic sometimes mention some of these images? He makes these writers and their works clash and oppose each other. He treats Pavlenko's novel "Happiness" and Azaev's novel "Far from Moscow" in this way. The first novel seems to only reflect "the inspiration of the Soviet people", while the second only reflects "the will of the Soviet people." In order to "elevate" Batmanov's image by every means possible, the critic actually reduces the significance of Vorobayev—the protagonist of the novel "Happiness", one of the successful Bolshevik images—to nothing.
    The critic described "Vorobayev's creative impulse", but immediately asked sarcastically: "Can he stay in this state for a long time?" And following is: "Vorobayev's image is released to such an extent in the writer's lyrical excitement that the boundary between the subjective and the objective disappears." What is contained in these two not-so-easy-to-understand assertions? If we believe the critic, then the lyrical beginning makes Vorobayev's image a non-typical image. "Therefore, why," the critic writes, "do we want to see a clear image of a communist leader in literature next to Vorobayev, this image is not only the embodiment of the inspiration of the Soviet people, but also typical, and at the same time has very distinct characteristics, an independently existing image... Then Batmanov appears."
    When continuing his policy of opposing the works of Soviet writers, the critic is not limited to distorting the facts. For example, when comparing Batmanov's image with the image of Gai in Pogodin's early drama "My Friend", he exclaimed:
    "How great is the difference between Batmanov and the typical commanders in the first few five-year plans before the war, and Gai in Pogodin's drama 'My Friend' is a vivid embodiment of these commanders... Think about how Gai educates his assistants: cheat, steal, destroy, no matter what—as long as you complete the task and give the country a new and powerful enterprise. Then we will analyze it!..."
    First of all, there is obvious malice here: there is no such preaching by Gai as the critic wrote in Pogodin's play "My Friend", these words were not said by Gai, but by another person. It is even more strange that the critic tried to say that the person who worked according to the principle of "cheat, steal, no matter what" was the typical representative of the commanders in the first few five-year plans before the war, that is, those who built the DneproHES, the city of Magnitogorsk, and the Stalin Tractor Factory, creating a powerful socialist industry.
    The essay also uses Azaev's novel to oppose Panova's works. Here again, it reveals that the critic is not concerned about the development of Soviet literature, and does not take a principled and at the same time comradely criticism of the shortcomings in the creation of this or that writer, but tries to say the problem is that, except for the novel "Far from Moscow", there is no outstanding or meaningful work in Soviet literature. The essay also made an unfounded accusation against Panova, saying that her talent "bears the mission of maintaining the old to exclude the new, which is incompatible with talent."
    No, what is expressed in Gurvich's essay is not concern for the growth of Soviet literature, but on the contrary, it is an attempt to make Soviet writers conflict with each other, reducing and lowering the achievements of the entire Soviet literature. Three Gurvich's discussion of several aesthetic issues has aroused major rebuttals. When the critic reduces the object of art to some abstract "inner world of man", he reaches an open opposition to the basic requirements of Marxist aesthetics.
    Lenin wrote in a letter to Gorky: "When you don't understand the actual, you can't help but only understand the...appearance of man." When describing characters, we cannot separate their inner world from their practice, their social, political and labor practice.
    Everyone knows that socialist realism is the basic method of Soviet art and literature and literary criticism, and it also requires artists to correctly and historically specifically describe the reality in revolutionary development. At the same time, the correctness and historical specificity of describing reality should be combined with the task of ideologically transforming and educating laborers in the communist spirit. Correctness, ideological guidance—these are the most important standards that socialist realism puts forward for artistic creation. But the critic advocates something directly opposite. "The unknown quantity studied by poets," he wrote, "is the reserve force of the human soul. No matter what form this force is expressed in, everyone understands it. It connects people who are separated by space, time, different levels of culture, and different professions." Under such an argument, any representative of bourgeois aesthetics can sign it.
    The critic uses this ugly point of view to analyze Azaev's novel "Far from Moscow". He does not answer the main questions: What special phenomena in national life are reflected in the novel? What kind of life truthfulness and artistic clarity does the writer use in his works to describe these phenomena? How did the Party's instructions on ideological issues help the writer to more deeply understand the development of our country's reality and more correctly reflect these developments in the novel? These questions are not of interest to the critic.
    Most of the analysis of the characters in the novel is based on academic inferences. Batmanov is only regarded as the embodiment of will, while Chalkin is the embodiment of wisdom and philanthropy. The critic initially raised Batmanov above all the positive figures in Soviet literature, but now, when he compares him with Chalkin, he overthrows this figure. "...There is a realm of emotion and communication," the critic writes, "Chalkin's understanding of this realm is far deeper than Batmanov's." "Batmanov repeats intelligently, but only repeats, while Chalkin touches people's hearts..."
    When comparing these protagonists in an artificial way, the critic also violates facts and reason, trying to make people accept his ugly proposition, that is, the difference between Chalkin and Batmanov's personalities, their work style, behavior and attitude towards people—this is a "unique conflict." This is the conflict between the "'father' and 'mother' who are thinking about how to cultivate 'loyal children'."
    The critic correctly pointed out that the collective in the novel is well written. But when analyzing the work, he does not explain what method the writer uses to creatively solve this task. Everyone knows that communists and party organizations are the soul and leading force of any Soviet collective. This is also expressed in the novel "Far from Moscow". However, the critic did not touch on this most important issue for our literature in his lengthy essay. The overuse of academic discussions that are divorced from reality has resulted in the content of the novel "Far from Moscow" being distorted.
    Of course, this essay we are discussing also contains correct views and fair comments, but they cannot change the basic bad nature of this essay.
    If there were only individual deviations and partial errors in the article "The Power of Positive Examples", then it would not have been necessary to discuss it in such detail. But the content of the essay shows that we are facing a repetition of the anti-patriotic views in literary criticism that have been condemned by the Party.
    Are the errors of the critic Gurvich accidental? No, not accidental. Everyone knows that Soviet public opinion in 1949 exposed and condemned the activities of the anti-patriotic theater critic—the cosmopolitan group, which also included Gurvich.
    In his previous essays, this critic compared Soviet literature with classical literature in order to lower the most advanced phenomena of Soviet literature. In his book "Looking for Protagonists", he promoted the idea that Soviet literature has not created real characters. He tried his best to find the double and incomplete consciousness and character in the character images of Soviet literature, and tried his best to slander Soviet people.
    In this essay, of course, the critic uses a different form, using Soviet literature to oppose Russian classical literature. He needs to do this in order to distort and obliterate the great classical heritage that the Soviet people are proud of. When the critic praised the novel "Far from Moscow" without measure, he was also trying to lower the achievements of the entire Soviet literature. The critic is also digging in the "depths" of the subconscious with the same position, still returning to the old notorious double-layeredness in finding the character of Soviet people.
    The appearance of Gurvich's essay in *Novy Mir* once again reminds us that we must never take a liberal attitude towards attempts to drag incompatible anti-patriotic views into literary criticism.

    反对重复文学批评中的反爱国主义观点
    苏联真理报专论
    编者按：苏联真理报的这篇专论，批判了苏联文艺批评家阿·古尔维奇的反爱国主义的错误观点。阿·古尔维奇在第九期“新世界”杂志上所发表的论文“正面范例底力量”中，充塞着对俄国古典文学伟大遗产的反爱国主义观点，无视于从车尔尼雪夫斯基到高尔基的许多伟大作品对俄国历史的推动作用，认为“伟大的俄国作家们没有创造出具有正面范例底力量的有全部价值的人物形象”。在分析和评价苏联文学中正面人物形象时，阿·古尔维奇把今天全世界人民都引为优秀范例的苏维埃正面人物形象也一笔勾消；力图说明除了阿札耶夫的“远离莫斯科的地方”外，苏联文学中再没有出色的、有意义的作品；力图缩小、贬低苏维埃文学的成就。阿·古尔维奇对于某些美学问题的论点，也是错误的，如把艺术对象仅仅归结于某种抽象的“人底内心世界”。
    真理报的这篇专论对于这些错误论点，都进行了严格的批判。专论有力地指出：这些错误和缺点表明着，文学批评中反爱国主义观点的复发，是由于对苏联文学采取非关怀态度而造成的。
    真理报的这篇专论是十分值得我们重视的。它对于我们的文艺批评工作有很大的启发。我们应该注意在自己的工作中加强警惕，防止该专论所批评的类似的反爱国主义的思想倾向。在我们的某些批评论文中，存在着企图抹杀我国古典文艺遗产和新的工农兵文艺的辉煌成就的错误论点，这种论点虽是个别的，但仍应引起我们注意。同时，从积极的一方面，我们应该进一步地加强认识与研究我国伟大文化遗产，这篇专论在这方面也给了我们很大帮助。
    文学批评面前的重大任务是：研究社会主义的现实主义问题，用各种方法促进苏维埃文学底繁荣，提高它在共产主义教育中的作用。每一个想从理论上阐明苏维埃文学紧要问题的重大尝试，每一论述苏维埃作家创作的内容丰富的发言，都得到我国读者底关心和赞同。
    “新世界”杂志第九期发表了阿·古尔维奇底一篇论述重大问题——创造艺术文学中的正面人物形象——的论文“正面范例底力量”。
    这位批评家在论文第一部分中肯定说，伟大的俄国作家们没有创造出具有正面范例底力量的有全部价值的人物形象。如果也有“无可争辩的正面形象”，那也“几乎全是女性”。是的，这些形象——据批评家自认——“仅仅在一种关系方面……在恋爱中”表现了自己的美德。如果相信这位批评家的话，那就是俄国现实生活没有给作家们足够的材料以创造“该时代最先进的人物”形象，俄国现实生活底主人公乃是各种类型的“懒散人”。
    这位批评家所提的第一个论点就是如此。
    论文第二部分的任务是：指出如何解决苏维埃文学中创造正面人物形象的问题。如果说这位批评家在论文底第一部分中为了自己的结论竭力整个地引用古典文学，那么在第二部分——论文底主要部分中，他实际上只从整个苏维埃文学中取了一本著作——维·阿札耶夫底长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”。古尔维奇把阿札耶夫底书同其它的艺术作品比较时断言说：“这部长篇小说才是现在苏维埃文学底最重要的，劳动战线上的枢纽阵地。它开辟了一条走向伟大共产主义建设的史诗底康庄大道。”
    这位批评家所提出的第二个论点就是如此。
    这位批评家把他的论断建立在决定文学分析方法的美学要求基础上说：“意识底美学形式有自己的对象。它底特有的和无所不包的对象，就是人底内心世界。”作品中有无某种“人的灵魂底后备力量”，乃是艺术性底主要标准。
    这位批评家所提出的第三个论点就是如此。一论到俄国古典文学时，该文作者断言似乎俄国文学没有能够把当时的先进人物包括进自己主要的主人公内。按照他底意见，俄国古典文学中“用各种形式，常常歪曲地刻划了新的人物底个别特征，但整个的人物却没有为作家底手所掌握过”。
    每一个稍微知道一点俄国文学的人都明白，这位批评家底论断是与历史的真实相违背的。伯林斯基早在百多年前就在他底论文“思想和俄国文学的笔记”中写过：“对于我们社会来说，文学甚至是现实道德观念底活的源泉。”而在给果戈里的著名的信中，他骄傲地说，俄国社会“把俄国作家看作自己的唯一的领袖，逃避俄国专制的保卫者和救星”……
    谁不知道，先进的俄国作家发展了高尚的爱国主义与解放的理想。而且这些理想具体表现在一定的形象中，这难道不明明白白吗？非常重要的是：列宁在谈到先进革命理论底作用时，一九○二年曾提到“俄国文学目前所具有的世界意义……”。
    对生活底要求非常锐敏的先进的俄国作家，曾在其作品中创造了一系列正面人物形象，这些人物底高尚的范例曾积极地影响了社会的前进力量，教育了这些力量。不能用衡量我们苏维埃时代的人物的同一尺度来衡量已往的人物。生活在具体的历史条件中提出了自己时代底一定的先进人物的典型。只有从历史条件的观点出发，才能正确论断这一或另一文学中的人物。在格里巴叶托夫〔一〕和普希金、十二月党人作家们底作品中，在屠格涅夫、奥斯特洛夫斯基、赫尔岑、车尔尼雪夫斯基、涅克拉索夫和其他许多作家底作品中，都描写了当时的正面人物。
    而“新世界”的论文底作者是怎样看俄国文学呢？他实际上甚至否认革命家拉赫麦托夫这一形象范例底力量。根据这位批评家底论断，车尔尼雪夫斯基底长篇小说“何为”底主人公拉赫麦托夫——“不仅是一个插话式的，而且是一个硬加进去的人物……他没有参加实际行动，也就是没有参加生活本身的运动”……换言之，结论就是拉赫麦托夫不是一个有生命的，不是现实的人物。
    实际上，拉赫麦托夫底形象体现了六十年代俄国革命民主运动所锻炼出来的一个职业革命家底特征。大家知道，列宁把车尔尼雪夫斯基底长篇小说“何为”评价得多高。这本书教育了无产阶级革命家底后代。“……从来没有一本文学著作——季米特洛夫写道，——像车尔尼雪夫斯基底长篇小说这样强烈地影响过我的革命教育……我所特别喜爱的是拉赫麦托夫。我抱定目的作一个果敢的、坚忍不拔的人，在同艰难和困苦的搏斗中锻炼自己的意志和性格，使自己个人生命服从于工人阶级伟大事业的利益，——一句话，作一个我所想像的车尔尼雪夫斯基底毫无瑕疵的主人公那样的人物”。
    甚至在如列宁所称的那善于穿过一切障碍实现农民革命理想的车尔尼雪夫斯基的创作中，这位批评家也没有发现正面英雄人物底鲜明的典型形象。对于古典文学底这一出色成就避而不谈——就是对于体现在古典文学中的俄国人民底革命传统，每一个苏联人所珍贵的传统弃置不顾。
    首先在世界上完成了社会主义革命和建设了社会主义社会的俄国人民，有权以其革命传统而自豪。他也理当以俄国的古典文学为骄傲，这个文学以其在世界文学中的先进思想而超群出众。
    斯大林指出：“全世界革命工人底领袖们都无厌地在研究俄国工人阶级底最富教育意义的历史，工人阶级底过去，俄国底过去，同时知道，除去反动的俄国外，还存在过一个革命的俄国，拉季雪夫〔二〕和车尔尼雪夫斯基、席尔雅鲍夫〔三〕和乌里雅诺夫、哈尔图林〔四〕和阿列克谢叶夫〔五〕底俄国。这些便在俄国工人底心中种下（不能不种下！）能排山倒海，能创造奇迹的革命的民族骄傲的感情。”
    现实主义的俄国文学——在其优秀作品中正确地刻划出了革命俄国的活动家们底许多特征。社会主义的现实主义文学——乃是同无产阶级革命运动，同社会主义建设有不可分的联系的艺术创作发展底新阶段。苏维埃文学一方面在质量上优于批判的现实主义的文学，一方面又继承着与创造地发展着俄国与世界古典文学底优秀的传统。
    社会主义的现实主义文学底创建者，天才作家高尔基高度地评价了俄国古典文学底高贵传统，创造性地发展了这一传统，增加了我们祖国文学底荣誉。还在十月革命前，他便在无产阶级中看见了英雄——世界底改造者，并把他们作了自己作品底中心人物。高尔基在世界文学中第一个以超群的艺术力量创造了俄国革命工人、争自由的斗士、新生活的建设者底形象。
    因此，这一事实，即“正面范例底力量”一文底作者，在研究他所提的历史计划中的问题时，对高尔基艺术创作、他所创造的有巨大正面范例力量的革命战士的不朽形象底巨大社会意义一点一声不响，不能不遭遇到坚决的反对。
    由此看来，古尔维奇在他的论文中正把反爱国主义的观点拖进俄国古典作家底伟大遗产中来，企图把苏维埃作家设想为一些六亲不认的张三李四。二这位批评家对苏维埃文学中的正面人物形象是怎样分析和估价的呢？
    批评家在其论文中，对苏维埃作家在创造正面人物形象方面的全部最丰富的经验避而不谈。结果是，仿佛俄国文学底发展中，在车尔尼雪夫斯基与阿札耶夫之间，既没有过高尔基，也没有过马雅珂夫斯基、绥拉菲摩维奇、阿历克赛·托尔斯泰、萧洛霍夫、法捷耶夫、奥斯特洛夫斯基、格拉特珂夫等人底作品，没有过创造了我们时代底正面人物形象的苏维埃作家大军。论文作者实际上是不承认这样的形象，如富曼诺夫底长篇小说“夏伯阳”中的夏伯阳，萧洛霍夫底“被开垦的处女地”中的达维多夫，法捷耶夫底“毁灭”中的莱奋生和木罗式加，阿·托尔斯泰底“苦难的历程”中的杰列金，潘菲洛夫底“伯鲁斯柯夫”中的日达尔金，巴甫连柯底“幸福”中的伏罗巴耶夫，巴巴也夫斯基底“金星骑士”中的谢尔盖·图塔里诺夫，斐定底长篇小说中的伊斯魏柯夫，以及其他许多人物形象。
    但是，这位批评家有时也提到这些形象中的某几个形象，但他是怎样提的呢？他使这些作家们及其作品冲突和对立。他是这样对待巴甫连柯底长篇小说“幸福”和阿札耶夫底长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”的。其中头一部小说似乎只反映了“苏联人民底灵感”，而第二部只反映了“苏联人民底意志”。为了想尽办法“抬高”巴特马诺夫底形象，批评家实际上把伏罗巴耶夫——长篇小说“幸福”底主人公，成功的布尔什维克形象之一——底形象的意义归结到一文不值。
    这位批评家叙述了“伏罗巴耶夫底创作冲动”，但即刻就嘲讽地问道：“能长久处在这种状态中吗？”而跟着是：“伏罗巴耶夫底形象在作家底抒情的激动中放开到如此程度，以致使主观与客观之间的界线在消失。”这两句不大好懂的断语里面包含什么意思呢？如果相信这位批评家的话，那就是抒情的开端使伏罗巴耶夫底形象成了不是典型的形象了。“因此为什么，——批评家写道，——我们这样想在伏罗巴耶夫旁边看见文学中的领导者的共产党人底鲜明的形象，这形象不仅是苏维埃人民底灵感的化身，而且是典型的，同时又是个性突出的，具有非常明确特征的形象，独立存在的形象……于是出现了巴特马诺夫”。
    这位批评家在继续其反对苏维埃作家底作品的方针时，并不仅限于歪曲事实。例如，他在把巴特马诺夫底形象同波果金底早期戏剧“我的朋友”中的加依底形象比较时，赞叹道：
    “在巴特马诺夫与战前头几个五年计划时期中的指挥员底典型之间，有多么巨大的不同，而波果金底戏剧‘我的朋友’中的加依就是这些指挥员的鲜明的化身……想一想，加依是怎样教育他底助手的：欺骗吧，偷窃吧，毁坏吧，不管怎么吧——只要完成任务和给国家以新的强大的企业就成。然后我们再分析吧！……”
    首先，这儿表现了显明的恶意：波果金底剧本“我的朋友”中没有批评家所写的加依底那类说教，这些话不是加依，而是另一个人说的。还更奇怪的是批评家企图把那位照“欺骗吧，偷窃吧，不管怎么吧”原则工作的人说成是战前头几个五年计划时期的指挥员，也即是那些建设德涅泊水电站、马格尼托果尔斯克城、斯大林拖拉机工厂的人，创建强大的社会主义工业的人底典型代表。
    论文中也用阿札耶夫底小说来反对潘诺娃底作品。这里又表露出批评家不是关怀苏维埃文学底发展，对这一或另一作家创作中的缺点不是采取原则的而同时是同志的批评，而是力图把问题说得这样，即似乎除去长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”外，苏维埃文学中毫无出色的、有意义的作品。论文中对潘诺娃也作了毫无根据的非难，说她底才能“担负着同才能不相容的维护旧的来排斥新的的使命”。
    不，古尔维奇论文中所表现的不是对苏维埃文学的成长的关怀，而相反，是力图使苏维埃作家之间互相冲突，减少和降低整个苏维埃文学底成就。三古尔维奇对几个美学问题的论述引起了重大的反驳。这位批评家在把艺术底对象，归结成某种抽象的“人底内心世界”时，即达到对马克思主义美学底基本要求的公然反对。
    列宁在致高尔基的信中写道：“不明白实际时，也就不能不是只了解人底……表象。”在描写人物时，不能把他们的内心世界同他们的实际、他们的社会、政治与劳动的实践分开。
    大家知道，社会主义的现实主义是苏维埃艺术文学和文学批评底基本方法，同时又要求艺术家正确地、历史地具体描写革命发展中的实际。同时，描写实际的正确性与历史的具体性应当同用共产主义精神从思想上改造与教育劳动者的任务相结合。正确性，思想指导性——这就是社会主义的现实主义对艺术创作所提的最首要的标准。这位批评家却主张一种直接对立的东西。“诗人们所研究的未知量，——他写道，——是人的灵魂底后备力量。这力量无论表现在那种形式中，他都是谁都理解的。他联结着被空间、时间、不同文化程度、不同职业所分开的人们”。在这样的论点下面，任何资产阶级的美学代表都可署名的。
    这位批评家就是以这种丑恶的观点分析阿札耶夫底长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”的。他不回答主要问题：长篇小说中反映了国家生活中的什么特异现象？作家在其作品中是以何种生活真实性与艺术明确性描写了这些现象？党关于思想问题的指示如何帮助了作家更深刻认识我国现实生活的发展和更正确地在小说中反映了这些发展？这些问题对批评家是不感兴趣的。
    大部分对小说中人物的分析是建立在学院式的推论上。巴特马诺夫只是被看作意志底化身，而查尔金特是智慧与博爱底化身。批评家最初是把巴特马诺夫提到苏维埃文学底一切正面人物之上，但现在，当他把他同查尔金特比较时，又推倒了这个人物。“……有一种感情和交往的境界，——批评家写道，——查尔金特对这境界的认识远比巴特马诺夫为深”。“巴特马诺夫聪明地重复着，但仅只重复着，而查尔金特却感人心腑……”
    批评家在矫揉造作地比较这些主人公时，同时违背事实与理性，企图令人接受他的这一丑恶的命题，即查尔金特和巴特马诺夫性格的不同、他们工作作风、行为和对人态度的不同——这是“独特的冲突”。这是想着如何培养“忠实的孩子”的“‘父亲’与‘母亲’的冲突”。
    批评家正确地指出小说中的集体写得很好。但在分析作品时，他不阐明作家用什么方法创造性地解决了这一任务。大家知道，共产党员、党组织乃是任何苏维埃集体底灵魂和领导力量。这也表现在长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”中。但是，批评家在他底冗长的论文中没有触及这一对我国文学最重要的问题。对于脱离实际的学院式的议论的滥用，结果使得长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”底内容也成了变态的了。
    当然，在我们所论述的这篇论文中，也含有正确的看法和公正的评语，但是它们不能改变这篇论文底基本的不良性质。
    如果在“正面范例底力量”一文中只是个别的偏差和部分性的错误，那就不会有必要来这样详细论述它了。但是论文底内容表示出我们面前是早被党所谴责过的文学批评中的反爱国主义观点的重复。
    批评家古尔维奇底这些错误是不是偶然的呢？不，不是偶然的。大家知道，苏维埃舆论在一九四九年曾揭露与谴责过反爱国主义的剧院批评家——世界主义者小组底活动，这小组中也包括古尔维奇。
    这位批评家在其先前的论文中以古典文学对比苏维埃文学，为了降低苏维埃文学底最先进的现象。他在“寻找主人公”一书中宣传这一思想，仿佛苏维埃文学没有创造出真实的人物。他竭力在苏维埃文学底人物形象中寻找双重的与不完备的意识和性格，竭力对苏维埃人进行诽谤。
    在现在这篇论文中，当然，批评家是用另一种形式，是用苏维埃文学来反对俄国古典文学。他需要这样作，以便歪曲地提出和抹杀苏维埃人民以之自豪的伟大的古典遗产。批评家在无分寸地夸赞长篇小说“远离莫斯科的地方”时，同时也就是企图降低整个苏维埃文学底成就。这位批评家又以同样的立场在潜意识的“深处”挖掘，仍旧归在寻找苏维埃人底性格中的老样的臭名昭著的双层性。
    古尔维奇底论文在“新世界”杂志中的出现，又一次提醒我们：对想把不相容的反爱国主义观点拖进文学批评中来的企图绝对不能采取自由主义的态度。
