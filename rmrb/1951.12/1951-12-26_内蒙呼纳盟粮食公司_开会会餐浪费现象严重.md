    Inner Mongolia Hulunbuir League Grain Company
    Serious Waste in Meeting Meals
    Editor: In order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, the whole country is enthusiastically carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The drought in some areas of Inner Mongolia is severe, and increasing production and practicing economy is even more necessary. However, the leading cadres of some enterprises and institutions in Inner Mongolia do not pay enough attention to this work. They think corruption is shameful, but they do not know that waste is also shameful. Therefore, a serious phenomenon of extravagance and waste has formed. For example, in early December, when the Hulunbuir League Grain Company held a meeting on grain requisition and purchase at the Hailar City Industry and Commerce Department, one meal for 64 people cost more than 4.8 million yuan; the miscellaneous expenses also exceeded the regulations by one and a half times. Such shocking waste did not attract the attention of the company's leading cadres; instead, they approved the reimbursement. The Industry and Commerce Department is the leading organ of the various companies, and it should not take the lead in destroying the system (because the banquet was arranged by the Industry and Commerce Department). I think this behavior of not cherishing state property should be stopped. The purpose of our meeting is to better complete our work tasks, not to eat and drink extravagantly. I hope that all agencies will pay attention to avoiding similar extravagance and waste when holding meetings.

    内蒙呼纳盟粮食公司
    开会会餐浪费现象严重
    编辑同志：为了支持中国人民志愿军，全国各地正在热烈地开展增产节约运动。内蒙部分地区旱灾严重，增产节约更是十分必要。可是内蒙有些企业机关的领导干部，对这项工作还不够重视。他们认为贪污可耻，而不知道浪费也是可耻的。因此形成严重的铺张浪费现象。例如：十二月上旬，呼纳盟粮食公司在海拉尔市工商处召开征、购粮食会议时，六十四个人会了一次餐，就花掉四百八十多万元；杂支费开支，也超过规定一倍半。像这样惊人的浪费，并没有引起公司领导干部的注意，他们反而批准报销。工商处是领导各公司的机关，不应该带头破坏制度（因为宴席是工商处代办的）。我认为这种不爱护国家财产的行为，是应当加以制止的。我们开会的目的是为了更好地完成工作任务，而不是为了大吃大喝。希望各地机关在举行会议时，注意避免类似的铺张浪费现象。    刘  伟
