    The Xiamen Post Office Should Quickly Change the Phenomenon of Stockpiling Newspapers
    Comrade Editor: I have some opinions on the Xiamen Post Office's untimely distribution of the People's Daily. The Xiamen Post Office does not deliver the People's Daily on time. Instead, they deliver it five or six times a month, sometimes with five or six days without a newspaper, and sometimes five or six copies arrive together. For example, on October 15th, I received five days' worth of newspapers from October 1st to 5th at once. I don't think this is a matter of postal distance, but a specific manifestation of not valuing our Party Central Committee's organ newspaper.
    We very much need the People's Daily to guide our work and study, especially those who work in the newspaper industry, who need the timeliness of the newspaper even more, but the post office's distribution has turned the People's Daily into a historical magazine. This needs to be quickly improved.
                Staff Member of the Xiamen Daily Business Department, Lu Xianhe

    厦门邮局应迅速改变积压报纸的现象
    编辑同志：我对厦门邮局发行人民日报不及时有意见。厦门邮局投递人民日报不是按期送，而是一个月送五六次，有时隔五六天不见报，有时五六份
    一齐来。例如十月十五日就一次收到十月一日至五日的五天报纸。我认为这不是邮程远近的问题，而是对我们党中央的机关报不重视的具体表现。
    我们很需要人民日报指导我们的工作和学习，特别是做报纸工作的人，需要报纸的时间性更强，而邮局的发行却将人民日报变成了历史杂志。这是需要迅速改善的。
