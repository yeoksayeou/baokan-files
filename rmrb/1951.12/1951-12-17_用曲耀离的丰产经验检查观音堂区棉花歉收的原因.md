    Using Qu Yaoli's Experience in High Yields to Investigate the Reasons for Cotton Crop Failure in Guanyintang District
    Henan Shangqiu Cotton Planting Guidance Station Huang Dian

    Guanyintang District is a key cotton-growing area in the Shangqiu Special Zone of Henan Province. Last year, the yield of seed cotton per mu was 100 jin. This year, the cotton harvest is not yet complete, but the highest estimate is that each mu will yield a maximum of 60 jin of seed cotton, a reduction of 40 jin per mu compared to last year.

    Why the yield reduction?

    Inspection reveals the following four reasons:

    (1) Insufficient attention to timely sowing and ensuring full seedling emergence. Around the Grain Rain period this year, there was no thorough rain for a long time, and the masses of farmers did not have the habit of carrying water to plant seeds or seizing the opportunity to plant seeds while the soil was still moist. Some reluctantly sowed seeds, but because the soil lacked sufficient moisture, seedlings could not emerge well, resulting in missing plants. Others delayed for a long time before adopting the method of carrying water to plant seeds, but because of a lack of experience, they did not master the technique of using "watering the kiln" water for planting. As a result, moisture easily evaporated outward, the soil dried and solidified, and cotton seedlings could not emerge smoothly, resulting in missing seedlings. This shows that Qu Yaoli's experience of "preserving soil moisture and preventing drought to ensure full seedling emergence" is correct and should be rapidly promoted in this area.

    (2) Cotton field planting density was too low. This year, the planting density in Guanyintang District was mostly between 800 and 1,000 plants per mu, and some even had only 600 plants per mu. This is far from the 3,160 plants per mu achieved by Shanxi Province labor model Qu Yaoli. This again shows that Qu Yaoli's dense planting experience is the direction for increasing cotton yield per unit area.

    (3) Very little fertilizer was applied, and continuous cotton planting has led to insufficient soil fertility. Local cotton farmers have a customary saying: "Plant beans in fertile land, cotton in barren land," and "Newly cultivated land is not good for cotton flowering." Therefore, although Guanyintang District plants more than 20,000 mu of cotton, most of it is in second, third, or even fifth-class alkaline land. Farmers also believe that applying more fertilizer to new cotton land makes it easy for the cotton to develop stiff bracts, so they apply at most one cart of grass manure (equivalent to 1,500 jin) or 50 jin of bean cake per mu. Because little fertilizer is applied, cotton is prone to boll shedding; even if it does not shed, only the fruit branches at the base of the main stem have large bolls. Most of the fruit branches at the top of the cotton plant do not produce bolls, and even if they do, the bolls are very small, which is obviously due to insufficient nutrients. Looking at Qu Yaoli's cotton fields, he applied 12,000 jin of sheep manure and mule manure per mu, and also used 16 jin of ammonium sulfate as topdressing. His yield was more than 900 jin of seed cotton per mu, and he did not have stiff bracts. This proves that the saying "plant flowers in barren land" is incorrect, and farmers should be educated with the fact that Qu Yaoli applies more manure to change this old habit.

    (4) Pest control was not timely. Last year, when Guanyintang District was preventing and controlling aphids, the government promoted insecticidal equipment (cotton oil soap, sprayers) to farmers, but many people were unwilling to use it, believing that "aphids don't need to be treated, they will be gone after a rain." In early May of this year, aphids had already appeared before the cotton had grown true leaves. Although the leading organs repeatedly called for "treating small infestations, treating them early, and treating them thoroughly," and conducted key experiments in Changlou Township, the publicity was not carried out vigorously, and it still did not attract the attention of farmers. As a result, aphids continued to develop, and farmers only became anxious and began to accept the leadership of the Party and the People's Government to fight against pests when the cotton leaves were curled and withered. However, because they acted one step too late, the cotton plants were only the size of fists by early July. By the time they grew into plants and formed peaches, the frost season had arrived, resulting in an increase in frost-damaged flowers, and some young peaches could not even open frost-damaged flowers. This is an important reason for this year's yield reduction. This shows that Qu Yaoli's use of Ceresan for seed dressing, and continuous and timely pest control with tobacco water, "666" powder, and cotton oil soap, is also worth learning.

    Based on the above inspection, I would like to put forward a few suggestions on how to improve cotton planting techniques in various places in the future:

    (1) Seize the opportunity for winter plowing. Winter plowing is one of the effective methods to retain moisture, weather the soil, activate soil fertility, and eliminate or prevent pests and diseases. People's governments in various places should lead farmers to deep plow once in a timely manner after pulling up the stalks, and then harrow finely once to preserve moisture and remove weeds, while paying attention to killing underground insects and insect eggs. It is hoped that cotton-growing areas in various places will carry out winter plowing at least once or twice.

    (2) Advocate dense planting. It is more difficult to make one cotton plant produce one hundred peaches, but it is more likely to make two cotton plants produce one hundred peaches. Dense planting can increase yield, as proven by the Soviet experience and Qu Yaoli's experience. Therefore, we should widely publicize the benefits of dense planting to farmers in order to increase the yield of cotton per unit area.

    (3) Advocate applying more base fertilizer and supplementing with topdressing. Publicize Qu Yaoli's cotton high-yield experience and his fertilization methods and amounts to dispel farmers' concerns that applying too much fertilizer will cause excessive vegetative growth and stiff bracts, and strive not to plant "white bar" flowers (i.e., flowers planted without applying manure). Relevant leading organs and cooperatives should supply farmers with a large amount of fertilizer (mainly bean cake, cottonseed cake, and ammonium sulfate, etc.) in a timely manner to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for farmers.

    Qu Yaoli comprehensively improved technology and brought into play the role of various yield-increasing factors, which is why he achieved high yields. Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned points, experience in variety selection, irrigation, and other aspects should also be given great importance in research and study.

    用曲耀离的丰产经验检查观音堂区棉花歉收的原因
    河南商邱植棉指导站　黄　电
    观音堂区是河南省商邱专区的植棉重点区。去年每亩地产籽棉一百市斤；今年棉花还未收完，据较高估计，每亩最多能收六十斤籽棉，和去年相比，每亩减产四十斤。
    为什么会减产？
    检查起来有以下四个原因：
    （一）没有注意作到及时播种和保证全苗。今年谷雨前后，很长时间没有下透雨，农民群众又没有担水点种和趁墒借墒抢种的习惯，有的勉强下种，因土壤中水份不足，不能很好出苗，形成缺株；有的拖了很长时间，才采用担水点种的办法进行点种，但又因为缺乏经验，没有掌握好用“浇窑”水点种的技术，因此使水分容易向外蒸发，土壤干涸凝结，棉苗不能顺利出土，结果还是缺苗。这说明了曲耀离的“保墒防旱，保证全苗”的经验是正确的，是应该在这个地区迅速推广的。
    （二）棉田植株密度过稀。观音堂区今年植棉密度，每亩多在八百棵到一千棵之间，甚至有的每亩只有六百棵。这和山西省劳动模范曲耀离每亩三千一百六十棵相比，相差太远了。这又说明了曲耀离的密植经验是提高棉花单位面积产量的方向。
    （三）施肥很少，又连年种棉，地力不足。当地棉农的习惯说法是：“厚地种豆，薄地种棉花”，
    “生茬棉花，不好开花”，因此观音堂区虽种棉花两万多亩，大部分是二、三等地或五等碱地。农民群众还认为在新花地上多施肥，棉花容易开僵瓣，所以每亩最多上草粪一车（合一千五百斤）或豆饼五十斤。因为上肥料少，棉花就容易落蕾；即使不落蕾，也只是主干根部的果枝铃大，棉棵尖端的果枝大多不结铃，就是结了铃也很小，这显然是养分不足的原故。再看曲耀离的棉田，每亩施羊粪和骡马粪一万二千斤，又用硫酸铔十六斤作追肥，每亩收籽棉九百多斤，也没有开僵瓣，这又证明所谓“薄地种花”的说法是不正确的，应该拿曲耀离多上粪的事实教育农民改变这种旧习惯。
    （四）防治虫害不及时。观音堂区去年防治蚜虫时，政府向农民推广治虫药械（棉油皂、喷雾器），许多人不愿意要，认为“蚜虫不用治，一下雨就完了”。今年五月初，棉花还没长真叶，蚜虫就已经发生。领导机关虽一再号召“治小、治少、治了”，并在常楼乡作重点试验，但是没有大张旗鼓地展开宣传，仍然没有引起农民的重视。结果蚜虫继续发展，直到棉叶卷缩枯萎时农民才着急，才开始接受党和人民政府的领导，向虫害作斗争。可是因下手晚了一步，到七月初旬，棉棵才像拳头大小；等到长成棵结了桃，霜期已到，结果增多了霜黄花，甚至有些嫩桃连霜黄花都不可能开了。这是今年减产的重要原因。这说明了：曲耀离用赛力散拌种，并用烟草水、“六六六”药粉、棉油皂连续及时地防治虫害，也是值得我们学习的。
    根据上面的检查，我对各地今后应怎样改进植棉技术提出几点意见：
    （一）要抓紧冬耕。冬耕是保持水分、风化土壤、活跃地力、消灭或防止病虫害的有效方法之一。各地人民政府应当领导农民拔秸后及时深耕一遍，并细耙一次，做到保墒除草，同时要注意杀死地下虫和虫卵。希望各地植棉区至少做到冬耕一次或两次。
    （二）提倡密植。要使一棵棉花结一百个桃比较困难，要使两棵棉花结一百个桃可能性就大了。密植可以提高产量，苏联的经验和曲耀离的经验都证明了这一点。因此，我们应该广泛向农民宣传密植的好处，以提高棉花单位面积产量。
    （三）提倡多施基肥，补施追肥。宣传曲耀离棉花丰产经验和他的施肥法施肥量，解除农民怕施肥多了会疯秧开僵瓣的顾虑，争取不种“白杠”花（即不上粪种的花）。有关领导机关和合作社应大量供应农民肥料（主要是豆饼、棉饼和硫酸铔等），适时解决农民缺肥问题。
    曲耀离是全面改进技术，发挥了各项增产因素的作用，才得到丰产的。所以，除了以上提出的几点外，对于选种、灌溉等方面的经验，也应该十分重视研究和学习。
