Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th—Our special correspondent reports: The US military radio station in Tokyo broadcast at 5:00 PM today, admitting that "More than half of the names of American POWs provided by the Communist side have been checked against the files. So far, no discrepancies have been found." However, the same broadcast arbitrarily declared: "There is currently no evidence to prove that the Communist side's list is correct, and the publication of the list does not mean that these people have been freed." This fully proves the US side's unreasonable attitude on the POW issue, and, like on other issues, has placed the US side in a state of extreme contradiction and confusion. After receiving the truly complete and sufficient POW data presented by our side, the US side issued a statement on the 18th, stating that it would "immediately make every effort to review this list." After a whole day, the US side, after "checking against the files," finally could not help but admit that "more than half" of the data submitted by our side "did not find any discrepancies." This is in stark contrast to the pile of useless POW data handed over by the US side that cannot help solve the problem. This made the US side feel very headache, so the US side immediately slapped itself in the face, denied the facts, and talked nonsense, saying that "there is no evidence to prove that the Communist side's list is correct." Such self-contradictory and arbitrary propaganda is a consistent trick of the US side. It reflects the consistently unreasonable attitude adopted by the US side in the negotiations. The people of the world and the prisoners of war in the Korean War can easily further recognize how much sincerity the US side has in achieving a truce in Korea from the US side's unreasonable attitude and contradictory and arbitrary propaganda.

### 我方提出真正完整而充分的战俘资料后  美方竟进行武断宣传矛盾百出自打嘴巴

    我方提出真正完整而充分的战俘资料后
    美方竟进行武断宣传矛盾百出自打嘴巴
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：美方东京军中电台今日下午五时广播承认“共方提出的美军战俘名册，有一半以上已根据档案予以查考。至此为止，并未发现不符之处。”但同一广播又武断宣称：“现在并无证据能证明共方的名单是正确的，并且名单的公布并不意味着这些人已获得自由。”这充分证明了美方在战俘问题上蛮横无理的态度，和在其他问题上一样，已经使美方自己陷于极端矛盾和混乱的状态。美方接到我方拿出真正完整而充分的战俘资料之后，曾于十八日发出声明，表示要“立即作人力所能及的一切努力，来审查这种名册”，经过一整天的时间，美方“根据档案予以查考”之后，终于不能不承认我方所交出的资料已有“一半以上”“并未发现不符之处”。这和美方所交出的一堆不能帮助解决问题的废纸似的战俘资料恰恰成了极鲜明的对照。这就使美方感到十分头痛，于是美方又马上自打嘴巴，抹煞事实，信口开河地说什么“并无证据能证明共方的名单是正确”的了。这样自相矛盾的武断宣传是美方一贯的伎俩。它反映了美方在谈判中一贯所采取的蛮不讲理的态度。全世界人民以及朝鲜战争中的俘虏们，从美方这样蛮不讲理的态度和矛盾百出的武断宣传中，不难进一步认清美方对于实现朝鲜停战究竟有多少诚意了。
