Party Life

    Editor's Note: The rectification and education work of the Party Branch of Xiliucheng Village, Jinghai County, CCP, has been successful. When conducting education on communism and the standards of a Communist Party member, this branch closely linked it with the ideological situation of the Party members for explanation and organized discussions. Therefore, after the rectification, the ideological level of the Party members has been raised a step further. This experience can be used as a reference for various localities.
    Xiliucheng Village, Jinghai County, Hebei, was liberated in 1948, and the Party organization was established in March 1949. Except for three Party members who have taken the lead in joining the army, there are currently thirteen Party members. There are the following problems in the ideological style of the Party members: (1) The level of awareness of the Party members is very low. Generally, they do not understand the nature and ultimate goal of the Party, and they think that "the revolution is successful after the land is distributed" and they can "breathe a sigh of relief." (2) There were originally sectarian struggles in the village, and coupled with the undemocratic working style of the branch secretary, Xin Pingfu, the Party is not united enough. (3) Militia Captain Liu Zhimin and branch secretary Xin Pingfu are both honorary veterans. They are arrogant and boastful, put on airs in front of the masses, and sometimes do not implement the decisions and instructions of the superiors, doing their own thing. (4) Party members have a coercive and commanding style. Some people believe that "as long as the work can be completed, coercion is also wholeheartedly serving the people."
    The rectification work in this village began on August 1st, and a total of eleven Party members participated (two who were away and on sick leave).
    I. Understanding the Situation and Preparing
    At the beginning of the rectification, the work team explained the principles and purpose of the rectification. Most Party members welcomed the rectification and requested it; however, they generally had some incorrect understandings or concerns.
    Branch secretary Xin Pingfu, militia captain Liu Zhimin, and four others have been very active in their daily work and are also responsible cadres. They believe that "after the rectification, all those who do not work will work." However, on the other hand, because they have some shortcomings and errors in their work, they also have some ideological concerns: they are afraid of retaliation from others and afraid of being punished. Yu Yunlai and five others have not been active enough in their daily work, but they do not have major shortcomings and errors, and they have no concerns. They believe that the rectification can help them learn some methods. Gao Yongshun and Zhang Qingnian have very low awareness and are passive in their work. They "cannot figure out" the rectification and are somewhat afraid. Based on the above situation, the work team first repeatedly explained the rectification policy, affirmed the achievements of Party member cadres in their work, and also pointed out their shortcomings and errors in their work; for the second type of people, it pointed out that it was good that they were willing to rectify, but they must participate in the rectification with a positive attitude; for the third type of people, it further explained the principles and purpose of the rectification to eliminate their concerns. In addition, the work team had individual talks with each Party member to solve their ideological problems. It also helped Party members with difficult living conditions to solve practical difficulties by organizing production. As a result, the Party members' attitude towards rectification was basically corrected. Eleven Party members unanimously proposed to actively participate in Party rectification and study. And to achieve "three no delays," that is: no delay in study, no delay in work, and no delay in production.
    II. Education on Communism and the Communist Party
        (1) The central purpose of conducting communist education is to enable Party members to recognize the bright and great prospects of the revolution, the basic characteristics of socialist and communist systems, and how China can move from new democracy to socialism and communism.
    (1) Conduct education on the prospects of the revolution. The focus of this education is to enable Party members to generally understand the laws of social development, recognize the inevitability of China's transition to a communist society, so as to further specifically solve the "fatalistic" thoughts of "relying on fate" and other confused thoughts that remain in some Party members' minds. When explaining, start with the development of productive forces and the changes in production relations, pointing out that this is the basic factor determining social development, and enabling Party members to recognize the benefits of large-scale machine production. After explanation and discussion, most Party members examined their past erroneous views of "rich and poor are destined" and "in Daomen, obey the law well, and go to heaven after death," and recognized that this was due to the deception of the reactionary ruling class. After explanation and discussion, they further recognized that "society is created by labor," and "imperialism must die, and communism must come." Xin Pingzhi said: "With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the unity of workers and peasants, society will definitely progress faster."
    (2) Conduct education on socialism and communism. The focus of this education is to point out the prospects of the revolution, enabling Party members to recognize the highly developed productive forces and the happy and fulfilling lives of the people at that time. After explanation and discussion, Party members generally recognized that socialism can only be realized with the high development of industry and agriculture. However, in the process of discussion, two erroneous ideas were discovered: some viewed socialism with an empirical perspective and did not quite believe in large-scale machine production. Zhang Qingnian said: "With tractors, backward tools cannot be eliminated." Some wanted to realize socialism quickly. Gao Fengwu and Xin Pingan proposed: "Raise thousands of catties of rice to buy tractors and implement socialism quickly." Based on the above situation, the work team introduced the real situation in the Soviet Union to dispel everyone's doubts about large-scale production. For comrades with blindly impetuous emotions, they focused on explaining that the realization of socialism depends on the development of productive forces and cannot be based on empty ideas. After repeated explanations and discussions, everyone's thinking became clear, and they expressed that they would work actively to create conditions for socialism.
    (3) The question of how China can move from new democracy to socialism is easy to understand because everyone has studied the above two basic questions. At the beginning of the discussion of this issue, eight Party members examined their past erroneous thinking that dividing the land was "the success of the revolution." Xin Pingan said: "I used to think that dividing the land was communism, and sharing the property was the end of the revolution." Now he recognizes: "To move towards socialism, in addition to taking the lead in overthrowing the three enemies, Party members must also organize labor cooperation and develop production." Kong Lanying said: "I will definitely work actively in the future to create conditions for socialism."
    After the education on communism, the ideological level of the Party members has been improved, and the actual work has immediately improved. Under the leadership of the branch, four mutual aid groups were immediately organized in the village. After this, education on the standards of Party members was carried out.
    (2) Before conducting education on the standards of Party members, the work team first explained the history of the Party and the important significance of raising the standards of Party members. The Party members understood that the Party is the product of the combination of the Chinese workers' movement and Marxism-Leninism, that the Party is glorious, great, and correct, but that there are still some problems, and therefore should strive for higher standards for Party members.
    (1) Education on the nature of the Party. If this issue can be resolved well, other issues will be easily resolved. Therefore, careful research must be conducted in advance, and in the process of education, the ideological changes of Party members must be grasped at all times, and everyone should be flexibly guided to argue, and the debate should be gradually deepened to seek final unity of understanding and improve the level of thinking.
    When explaining the nature of the Party, first compare the modernized machine's large-scale production that everyone has seen with the decentralized and backward small-scale individual economy, comparing the efficiency of machine production with the efficiency of handicraft production, comparing trains with ox carts, comparing collectivism with individualism, and comparing organization with dispersion, affirming the advanced nature of the working class and explaining that the Party is the political party of the Chinese working class. After this explanation, Party members began to verbally admit that the Party is "the political party of the working class," but they still "cannot get it" in their hearts. Zhang Qingnian said: "The Party has done things for the peasants, so it is the party of the peasants." Xin Pingfu said: "Although the working class is progressive, the number of people is still small; only when China is industrialized and there are more workers will there be a working-class party." In response to these erroneous ideas, the work team further conducted the following education: in addition to affirming the role of peasants in the revolution and in production and construction, it also educated Party members to recognize the fundamental reasons why peasants cannot become the leading class. Then, it organized Party members to repeatedly discuss this point, and Party members realized that the Party is the political party of the working class. Xin Pingfu said: "Peasants are individual producers. Without the leadership of an advanced class, no matter how many people there are, they will fail. The revolutions of Li Zicheng and Hong Xiuquan in history are like this." Xin Pingan said: "Like fighting a war, the working class is the commander, and the peasants are the troops. It is not good to have troops without a commander, or to have a commander without troops." Xin Pingzhi said: "If you don't follow the path of the working class, the peasants will not be able to use machines and will not get the final liberation." In this way, everyone roughly clarified the difference between the Party and mass organizations, Party members and non-Party masses, and vanguards and ordinary workers; they understood that the working class realizes leadership over the peasants through the Communist Party; and they corrected the erroneous concept of some Party members who acknowledged the leadership of the Party but did not acknowledge the leadership of the working class.
    (2) Education on the ultimate goal of the Party. The purpose of conducting this education is to further strengthen the revolutionary outlook on life of Party members and criticize the half-hearted revolutionary ideas. After study and discussion, Xin Pingan made a self-criticism. He said: "I thought it was over after the houses and land were divided. I didn't know that the big thing was still behind." Xin Pingfu said: "To realize communism, we must not be scattered, but must unite closely, do our work well, and stand firm." Finally, ten people expressed their determination to fight to the end for the cause of communism.
    (3) Education on the Party's stance. This started with the attitude that Party members should have towards the cause of communism, and at the same time, it was linked to checking everyone's thoughts. Experience has proven that this method is successful. Because the Party members of this branch have been relatively stable in the past, they have gained a deeper understanding during this education. After the education, Party members realized: "If you don't continue halfway, you can't be a Party member." "If you don't stand firm, you can't get to communism." Xin Pingzhi and Yu Wenzhong also recalled some problems in the past struggles with landlords, which further improved their vigilance against the enemy. They said: "In the past, the landlord Gao Fengxiang gave us gifts, but he didn't have good intentions; if we didn't refuse, we would have been fooled by him."
    (4) When conducting education on obeying the organization and observing discipline, the work team considered that most of the Party members in this village were related as uncles and nephews, so the focus was on clarifying the relationship between Party members and the branch, the branch and the superiors, how Party members should observe Party discipline, and what attitude they should have towards phenomena that endanger the interests of the Party. When explaining, start with the importance of Party discipline, and then organize everyone to start a discussion. In the discussion, Xin Pingfu said: "The Party has won victory in thirty years of struggle because the Party has unified leadership. It is impossible without unified leadership. It is not good for a family to live without being of one mind, let alone the Party!" Xin Pingzhi said: "Destroying discipline is harming the interests of the people." After Party members recognized the importance of Party discipline, the work team further explained the leading role of the branch, the leading relationship between the branch and Party members, etc. The understanding of Party members gradually improved, and most Party members examined their past erroneous thoughts and behaviors. Liu Zhimin said: "Once, the branch secretary asked me to do propaganda work, but I went to convene a militia meeting. I thought, we are both honorary veterans, why should I be led by him? Now I realize that this is not doing things from the Party's standpoint." Branch secretary Xin Pingfu also examined himself, saying: "Sometimes when I come back from meetings of the county party committee and district party committee, I do not act according to the instructions of the county party committee and district party committee, but think of another set. I often do what I want to do and use feelings instead of policies. This is behavior without organization and discipline."
    (5) The process of explaining and discussing the relationship between individual interests and the interests of the Party is the process of sharp struggle between communist ideology and individualism. Before the explanation, Party members believed that "doing work delays production, and they suffer losses." They mechanically opposed the interests of the Party and individual interests, and did not understand that only when the working class and the working people are liberated can there be individual liberation. In order to eliminate these confused ideas, the work team first clarified the correct relationship between the individual interests of Party members and the interests of the Party. In the discussion, the work team also educated Party members to conduct examinations using the methods of recollection and comparison. Gao Fengwu said: "When the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries were here, how badly did we suffer; how good is the current situation; such a good situation was exchanged for the lives of countless revolutionary martyrs." This method of comparison has a great enlightening effect on Party members. After comparison, most Party members consciously examined their past selfish and self-interested thoughts and expressed their determination to correct them in the future. For example, Liu Zhimin said: "I used to think that I had done meritorious service for being injured, and I did not lead the militia to protect the road. How can such selfishness be a vanguard member!" Xin Pingzhi examined that his livestock had never worked. He said that if Party members have selfish and self-interested thoughts, they will inevitably become separated from the masses, because "Party members are like locomotives, and the masses are like train cars. If the locomotive does not move, the train car does not move. If Party members are selfish and self-interested, they will not be able to connect with the masses."
    (6) When conducting education on criticism and self-criticism, the center determined by the work team was: to enable Party members to recognize that criticism and self-criticism are weapons to ensure Party unity and continuous progress of Party members. The work team believes that establishing a correct view and correct attitude towards criticism and self-criticism will lay the foundation for review and appraisal. Before explaining this issue, the ideological situation of Party members was roughly: the actively working ones, on the one hand, believed that criticism should be carried out because they wanted to criticize those Party members who did not work, so that these people would also work and "vent their anger"; but on the other hand, they were unwilling to mention their own shortcomings. Those who are passive in their work or have some errors and shortcomings are afraid of criticism and self-criticism. Generally, it is believed that "criticism and self-criticism is just finding faults." Based on the above situation, the work team clarified the significance of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, criticized the erroneous understanding that criticism is "reducing prestige and damaging status" and "losing face," and explained that a correct attitude of upholding truth, correcting errors, learning from past mistakes, and treating illnesses to save people should be established. Gao Fengwu said: "So, criticism is really good, it can make everyone unite and the masses support it." Kong Lanying said: "Criticism can find out the advantages and disadvantages in the work, the advantages can be developed, and the root of the disadvantages can be found, which is good for correction."
    (7) When conducting education on wholeheartedly serving the people, the work team focused on correcting the coercive and commanding style and learning how to follow the mass line, aiming at the main problems existing in this branch. After explaining the relationship between Party members and the masses, that Party members should strengthen their mass perspective, and wholeheartedly serve the people, they also explained how to be a good servant of the masses and criticized the erroneous idea of being a "master" of the masses. In the discussion, Party members had two opinions on this issue: three people believed that "the method of coercion and command cannot serve the people"; nine people believed that "coercion and command are done with the intention of serving the masses, it is just a matter of method." After the debate, everyone realized that coercion and command were wrong and made examinations. At the same time, the erroneous idea of "lying down and not doing anything" was further criticized, and it was recognized that this was not at all the same as the idea of "wholeheartedly serving the people." Doing this is very necessary, because if you simply criticize the coercive and commanding style, it will give Party members the illusion that "those who do the work have errors." After the above education, Party members all made examinations in connection with themselves. Gao Fengwu said: "I didn't wholeheartedly serve the people in the past, and I didn't even go to meetings. I am really the tail of the masses." After the examination, Party members all expressed that they would do their work well in the future.
    (8) After initially understanding the necessity of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially after understanding that they cannot coerce and command, nor can they commit the error of tailism, in order to follow the mass line and do their work well, Party members felt that they had to study hard. Xin Pingan plans to study culture and theory well this winter. Zheng Lianying expressed that he would study the Party Constitution well.
    After the education on the standards of Party members, Party member registration was carried out, and Party members all expressed their determination to be qualified Party members. After this, the review and appraisal work began. When carrying out this work, the work team first explained that criticism and self-criticism must be carried out, and that a loyal and honest attitude must be adopted towards the Party. Then, for three days, the work was checked and summarized to further lay the foundation for criticism and self-criticism; then, each Party member was reviewed, appraised, and conclusions were made. In the review, each Party member was specifically measured by the standards of Party members, their past achievements and advantages were affirmed, their shortcomings and errors were deeply criticized, so that they clearly recognized the direction of their future efforts. In addition, appropriate organizational handling was done.
    III. New Atmosphere of Xiliucheng Village Branch after Party Rectification
        After the Party Branch of Xiliucheng Village was rectified, the work has made significant progress, mainly reflected in:
    (1) The Party members who were active in the past have become more active, and the vast majority of Party members who were passive in the past have also become active. For example, Liu Zhimin led the masses to dig river soil and persisted in working in the heavy rain; Zhang Qingnian, who had never worked, is now working actively, taking the lead in organizing a mutual aid group, and leading the masses to carry out autumn harvest and river digging work. Due to the active work of the Party members, the work in the village has become active. In order to solve the contradictions between autumn harvest, autumn planting, and river management, Party members took the lead in organizing fifteen mutual aid groups, and women also organized twenty-one mutual aid groups to go to the fields to participate in production, making up for the shortage of male labor. Thanks to the leading role of Party members, the masses were guaranteed to carry out autumn planting and autumn harvest in a timely manner, and the area of wheat planting was expanded. Most of the masses have ordered wheat planting plans.
    (2) The working style of Party member cadres has changed. Now, when carrying out work, Party member cadres mostly adopt the method of persuasion and mobilization, and prepare early for some work that can be foreseen in advance. For example, during the autumn harvest, they called on the masses to prepare for the payment of public grain. In this preparatory work, Party members played an exemplary role. In particular, branch secretary Xin Pingfu, every time he assigned work to cadres, took a negotiating attitude. In this way, he won the support of the masses. Mass representative Yu Yunzhi said: "After the rectification, the Party members are like they are during the New Year, talking to the masses happily, unlike the big model in the past." Some masses said: "The cadres have changed, and we can't fall behind."

### 中共静海县西琉城村支部的整党教育

专栏：党的生活

    中共静海县西琉城村支部的整党教育
    编者按：中共静海县西琉城村支部的整党教育工作是有成绩的。这个支部在进行关于共产主义的教育和关于共产党员标准的教育时，都是紧密联系党员的思想情况进行讲解和组织讨论的，所以经过整党，党员的思想水平提高了一步。这一经验可供各地参考。
    河北静海县西琉城村是一九四八年解放的，一九四九年三月建立了党的组织。除三个党员已带头参军外，现有党员十三人。党员思想作风上有以下几个问题：（一）党员觉悟程度很低，一般的不了解党的性质和党的最终目的，认为“分了地就是革命成功”，可以“松口气”了。（二）村里原来有宗派斗争，加上支部书记信平福工作作风不民主，因而党内不够团结。（三）民兵队长刘志民和支部书记信平福都是荣誉军人，居功自傲，在群众面前摆老资格，有时不执行上级的决议和指示，自搞一套。（四）党员有强迫命令作风，一部分人认为“只要能完成工作，强迫命令也是全心全意为人民服务”。
    这个村的整党工作是八月一日开始的，共有十一个党员参加（外出和请病假的二人）。
    一、了解情况，作好准备
    整党开始时，工作组说明了整党的方针和目的，多数党员对整党抱着欢迎态度，要求整党；但一般还有些不正确的认识或顾虑。
    支部书记信平福及民兵队长刘志民等四人，在日常工作中，表现得很积极，又都是负责干部，他们认为“整一整，不工作的就都工作了”。但另一方面由于他们在工作中有些缺点和错误，思想上也有些顾虑：怕别人报复，怕受处分。于云来等五人，在日常工作中，表现得不够积极，但没有大的缺点和错误，没有什么顾虑，他们认为整党能学些办法。高永顺和张清年二人觉悟很低，工作消极，对整党“摸不着底”，有些恐惧。根据以上情况，工作组首先反复讲解了整党方针，肯定了党员干部在工作中的成绩，也指出了他们工作中的缺点和错误；对第二种人，指出他们愿意整党是好的，但必须用积极的态度参加整党；对第三种人则进一步说明整党的方针和目的，以消除他们的顾虑。另外，工作组和每一个党员进行了个别谈话，以解决他们的思想问题。并帮助生活困难的党员，通过组织生产，解决实际困难。这样一来，党员的整党态度基本上端正了。十一个党员一致提出要积极参加整党学习。并要作到“三不误”，就是：不误学习，不误工作，不误生产。
    二、关于共产主义和共产党
        的教育
    （一）进行共产主义教育的中心目的，是使党员认识革命前途的光明伟大，社会主义和共产主义制度的基本特点，及中国怎样由新民主主义走向社会主义和共产主义。
    （1）进行革命前途的教育。这种教育的重点是使党员大体认识社会发展规律，认识中国走向共产主义社会的必然性，以便进一步具体解决某些党员所残存的“凭天由命”的“宿命论”思想和其他糊涂思想。在讲解时，先从生产力的发展和生产关系的变化讲起，指出这是决定社会发展的基本因素，并使党员认识大机器生产的好处。经过讲解和讨论，多数党员检讨了过去“富和穷都是命该”、“在道门，好好地遵法，死后上天堂”的错误看法，认识了这是受了反动统治阶级的蒙蔽。又经过解释、讨论，进一步认识了“社会是劳动创造的”，
    “帝国主义一定死亡，共产主义一定要到来”。信平志说：“我们有了毛主席的领导，工农团结起来，社会一定进步得更快。”
    （2）进行社会主义和共产主义的教育。这种教育的重点是指明革命的远景，使党员认识到那时生产力的高度发展，人们生活的美满幸福。经过讲解和讨论，党员一般地认识到：只有工农业的高度发展，才能实现社会主义。但在讨论过程中，曾发现两种错误思想：有的用经验主义的眼光看社会主义，不太相信大机器生产。张清年说：“有了拖拉机，落后工具也不能取消。”有的则想很快实现社会主义。高凤五和信平安提出：“凑几千斤米去买拖拉机，赶快实行社会主义。”根据以上情况，工作组介绍了苏联实况，以打破大家对大生产的怀疑。对于有盲目急躁情绪的同志，则着重解释了社会主义的实现决定于生产力的发展，不能凭空想。经过反复的讲解、讨论，大家的思想明确起来，并且表示要积极工作，为社会主义创造条件。
    （3）对于中国怎样由新民主主义转向社会主义的问题，因为大家已经学习了上述两个基本问题，所以容易领会。一开始讨论这一问题时，就有八个党员检讨了过去认为分了地就是“革命成功”的错误思想。信平安说：“我过去认为分地就是共产，共了产就是革命到头了。”现在他认识了：“要想走到社会主义，党员除了带头打倒三个敌人以外，还要组织劳动互助，发展生产。”孔兰英说：“我以后一定积极工作，给社会主义创造条件。”
    经过了关于共产主义的教育，党员的思想水平提高了，实际工作也马上有了改进，在支部领导下，村里登时组织了四个互助组。这以后，接着进行了关于党员标准的教育。
    （二）在进行党员标准的教育以前，工作组先讲解了党的历史和提高党员标准的重要意义。使党员了解了党是中国工人运动和马克思列宁主义相结合的产物，党是光荣的、伟大的和正确的，但是还存在着一些问题，因此应该为更高的党员标准而奋斗。
    （1）关于党的性质的教育。这个问题能够很好地得到解决，其他问题也就容易解决了。因此，必须事先进行仔细的研究，在进行教育的过程中，并且要时时掌握党员的思想变化状况，灵活地引导大家争论，并使争论逐步深入，以求最后统一认识，提高思想水平。
    在讲解党的性质时，首先用大家亲眼见过的近代化机器的大生产，和分散落后的个体经济的小生产作比较，以机器生产的效率比手工业生产的效率，以火车比牛车，以集体比个体，以组织性比散漫性，肯定工人阶级的先进性，说明党是中国工人阶级的政党。经过这样讲解以后，党员开始在口头上承认了党是“工人阶级的政党”，但在内心里还是
    “搞不通”。张清年说：“党给农民办了事，就是农民的党。”信平福说：“工人阶级虽然进步，但是人数还少；等将来中国工业化了，工人多了，才能有工人阶级政党。”针对这些错误思想，工作组又进一步进行了如下的教育：除了肯定农民在革命中、在生产建设中的作用以外，同时教育党员必须认识农民不能成为领导阶级的根本原因。然后组织党员对这一点进行了反复的讨论，党员这才认识了党是工人阶级的政党。信平福说：“农民是个体生产，若没有先进阶级的领导，有多少人也得失败，历史上李自成和洪秀全的革命就是这样的。”信平安说：
    “像作战一样，工人阶级是指挥的，农民是部队，有部队没有指挥，有指挥没有部队都不行。”信平志说：“不按工人阶级的道走，农民使不上机器，得不到最后的解放。”这样大家就大体上弄清了党和群众团体、党员和非党群众、先锋队和普通工人的区别；了解到工人阶级是通过共产党对农民实现领导的；纠正了某些党员承认党的领导而不承认工人阶级领导的错误观念。
    （2）关于党的最终目的的教育。进行这种教育的目的是：进一步坚定党员的革命人生观、批判半截革命思想。经过学习、讨论，信平安作了自我检讨，他说：“我认为分了房子分了地就完事了，那知道大头还在后头呢。”信平福表示：“为实现共产主义，咱们大家不能散漫，要团结得紧紧的，作好工作，站稳立场。”最后有十个人表示坚决为共产主义事业而奋斗到底。
    （3）关于党的立场的教育。这是先从党员对共产主义事业应持的态度讲起的，同时联系检查每个人的思想。经验证明，这种讲法是成功的。由于过去这个支部的党员的立场较稳，因而这次进行教育时，他们领会得就比较深刻。经过教育以后，党员认识到：“半路上不干了，就不能当党员。”“立场站不稳，就不能走到共产主义。”信平志、于文仲还回忆了过去同地主斗争中的一些问题，更加提高了对敌人的警惕性。他们说：“过去地主高凤祥，给我们送礼，就没安着好心；我们要不拒绝，非上了他的当不可。”
    （4）在进行服从组织、遵守纪律的教育时，工作组考虑到这个村的党员多半有叔侄兄弟的关系，所以重点就放在了弄清党员和支部、支部和上级的关系，党员对党的纪律应怎样遵守以及对危害党的利益的现象应抱什么态度等问题上。在讲解时，先从党的纪律的重要性讲起，然后组织大家展开讨论。在讨论中，信平福说：“党在三十年的斗争中得到了胜利，这是因为党有统一的领导。没有统一的领导是不行的，一家子过日子不一条心还不行呢，何况党呢！”信平志说：“破坏了纪律就是危害了人民的利益。”在党员认识了党的纪律的重要性以后，工作组进而讲解了支部的领导作用，支部和党员的领导关系等，党员认识逐渐提高，多数党员检讨了过去的错误思想和行为。刘志民说：“有一次，支部书记叫我做宣传工作，我偏去召开民兵会议。我认为，俺俩都是荣誉军人，为什么我要受他领导呢？现在才知道，这不是站在党的立场上办事。”支部书记信平福也检讨了自己，他说：“有时我从县委、区委开会回来，不按县委、区委的指示办事，另想一套。常常想作什么就作什么，用感想代替政策，这就是无组织无纪律的行为。”
    （5）讲解和讨论个人利益和党的利益的关系问题的过程，就是共产主义思想和个人主义思想尖锐斗争的过程。讲解以前，党员认为“作工作就耽误生产，自己吃亏”，他们把党的利益和个人利益机械地对立起来，不了解只有工人阶级和劳动人民得到解放，才有个人的解放。为了扫除这些糊涂观念，工作组首先讲明了党员的个人利益和党的利益的正确关系。在讨论中，工作组又教育党员用回忆和比较的方法，进行了检讨。高凤五说：“日本鬼子和国民党反动派在这里的时候，咱们受气多厉害呀；现在的光景多么好呀，这样好的光景正是无数革命先烈拿生命换来的。”这种比较的方法对党员的启发作用很大。经过比较，党员多半自觉地检讨了过去的自私自利思想，并表示今后决心改正。如刘志民说：“我过去认为负了伤有功劳，民兵去护路，我也不带领。这样的自私自利，那能当先锋队员呢！”信平志检讨说，他的牲口从来就没有出过工。他说，党员要有自私自利的思想，就必然脱离群众，因为“党员好比火车头，群众好比火车皮。车头不走，车皮不动。党员自私自利，就和群众挂不上钩”。
    （6）在进行批评和自我批评的教育时，工作组确定的中心是：使党员认识批评和自我批评是保证党的团结和使党员不断进步的武器。工作组认为：树立批评和自我批评的正确观点和正确态度，将为审查和鉴定打下基础。在讲解这个问题以前，党员的思想情况大体是：工作积极的，一方面认为应当开展批评，因为他们想把那些不工作的党员批评一番，要这些人也都工作，“自己也出出气”；但另一方面对自己本身的缺点则不愿提。工作消极或本身有些错误缺点的，害怕批评和自我批评。一般的认为“批评和自我批评就是单找毛病”。根据以上情况，工作组讲明了进行批评和自我批评的意义，批判了认为批评是“降低威信，损害地位”、“丢脸”等错误认识，说明应树立坚持真理，修正错误，惩前毖后，治病救人的正确态度。高凤五说：“这么说，批评好处真大，又能使大家团结，群众还拥护。”孔兰英说：“批评能找出工作中的优缺点，对优点能发扬，对缺点能找出根子，好纠正。”
    （7）在进行全心全意为人民服务的教育时，工作组针对这个支部存在的主要问题，着重纠正强迫命令作风，学习如何走群众路线。在讲解了党员和群众的关系、党员应加强群众观点、全心全意地为人民服务等观点以后，又说明了怎样作群众的勤务员，批判了当群众的“老爷”的错误思想。在讨论中，党员对这一问题有两种意见：三个人认为“用强迫命令的办法，就不能为人民服务”；九个人认为“强迫命令，心是为群众服务，只是方式问题”。经过争论，大家认识了强迫命令是错误的，并作了检讨。同时进一步批判了“躺倒不干”的错误思想，认识了这和“全心全意为人民服务”的思想没有丝毫相同的地方。这样作是很必要的，因为如果单纯地批判强迫命令作风，就会给党员一种错觉，以为“干工作的就有错误”。经过了上述的教育，党员都联系自己做了检讨。高凤五说：“我过去没有全心全意为人民服务，甚至连开会也不到，真是群众的大尾巴。”经过检讨，党员都表示今后要好好干工作。
    （8）在初步懂得了学习马列主义和毛泽东思想的必要性以后，特别是懂得既不能强迫命令，又不能犯尾巴主义错误以后，为了走群众路线，做好工作，党员都觉得非好好学习不可。信平安计划今冬要好好学习文化和理论。郑连英表示要好好学习党章。
    经过了党员标准的教育，又进行了党员登记，党员都表示决心作一个够标准的党员，这以后，就开始了审查、鉴定工作。在进行这一工作时，工作组先讲解了必须开展批评和自我批评，必须对党采取忠诚老实的态度等问题，接着以三天时间，对工作进行了检查和总结，以进一步奠定批评和自我批评的基础；然后对每一个党员进行审查、鉴定，作出结论。在审查中，以党员标准具体地衡量了每一个党员，肯定了他们过去的成绩和优点，深刻地批判了他们的缺点和错误，使他们明确认识了今后努力的方向。另外，恰当地作了组织处理。
    三、整党后西琉城村支部的
        新气象
    西琉城村支部在整党以后，工作有了显著的进步，主要表现在：
    （一）过去工作积极的党员更积极了，过去工作消极的党员绝大多数也积极起来。如：刘志民带领群众去挖河土，在大雨中坚持工作；一贯不工作的张清年，现在也积极工作，带头组织了一个互助组，带动群众进行秋收和挖河工作。由于党员的积极工作，村里的工作活跃起来了。为了解决秋收、秋种和治河工作的矛盾，党员带头组织了十五个互助组，妇女也组织了二十一个互助组下地参加生产，弥补了男劳动力的不足。由于党员的带头作用，保证群众及时进行了秋种和秋收，并且扩大了种麦面积，大多数群众都订了种麦计划。
    （二）党员干部作风有了转变。现在，党员干部在进行工作时，大都采取说服动员的办法，一些事先能够预料到的工作，就早作准备。如在秋收中号召群众做好缴纳公粮的准备。在这种准备工作中，党员起了模范作用。特别是支部书记信平福，每次向干部布置工作，都采取商量的态度。这样就取得了群众的拥护。群众代表于云志说：“整党以后，党员像过年的时候一样，跟群众说话都是喜喜欢欢的，不像过去大模大样的了。”有的群众说：“干部有了转变，咱们也不能落后。”
