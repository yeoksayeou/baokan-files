    The Northeast Grain Company's Harbin office has made serious deviations in its policy of entrusting private oil mills with processing, causing significant losses to state property.

    In addition to the legitimate expenses of the capitalists plus a 15% profit, the Harbin office of the Northeast Grain Company also included the illegitimate expenses reported by the capitalists in the processing fees paid to them. Therefore, the higher the cost reported by the capitalists, the more profit they obtained proportionally. The Harbin office sat idly by as the capitalists encroached upon state property. From February to July 1951, the capitalists falsely reported that each bean cake required 5 to 5.5 jin of coal, 0.065 of cylinder oil, and 70 yuan for consumables. After checking the accounts, it was revised to 4.2 jin of coal, 0.0261 of cylinder oil, and 28 yuan for consumables per bean cake. From February to July 1951, the Harbin office lost over 2.43 billion yuan of people's currency to the state, of which coal alone accounted for a loss of 3,000 tons. Other items included: machine depreciation, which was recorded as 58,820 yuan per day, while the contract stipulated 124,850 yuan. The capitalists even added money donated for airplanes and cannons to the "cost" (according to Chen Zhenshan, manager of Yongshenghe). Seeing an opportunity to exploit, the capitalists sought to obtain illegal profits on the one hand, and desperately expanded the reactionary influence of the bourgeoisie on the other. The capitalists provoked the relationship between workers and the trade union and the company, creating an abnormal state of public-private and labor-capital relations. The capitalists often appeared under the guise of "caring" for workers' welfare, luring workers by saying, "As long as the company agrees, what's yours is mine." When the company criticized the capitalists, the capitalists would tell the workers, "Don't do that, the company has an opinion again." The capitalists used this method to make the workers dissatisfied with the company, while they pretended to be "good people." The capitalists also paid for the workers' transportation and meals to attend meetings; even if the trade union had already paid, the capitalists would pay again, and then include these expenses in the "cost." For example, the capitalists of Hengxiangdong demanded an increase in bonuses for the workers; the capitalists of Xingdong Oil Mill, the manager of Shuanghesheng, and the manager of Yichangxin, among others, took the lead in demanding an increase in wages for the workers, saying that the workers' wages were not high enough (although they were actually higher than those in state-owned enterprises); the capitalists gave the workers subsidies at the end of the year and also raised their wages. It was clear that the capitalists wanted to increase profits by raising costs, but they claimed that the trade union and the government were restricting the workers' demands. The capitalists squandered and wasted money on a large scale, raising the workers' monthly food expenses to 120 to 130 yuan, leaving a lot of leftovers that could not even be fed to pigs or dogs, and were even thrown into the toilet. Heju Public Oil Mill paid for the workers' families to eat and watch plays (in private boxes) during the National Day, and the money was included in the "cost"; the factory lights were left on day and night, and waste was rampant everywhere. In this situation, the capitalists only considered how to increase "costs," adopted a passive attitude towards business management, and did not care about production at all. For example, the manager of Tongchenghe used to be very concerned about production and had experience. The workers said, "He could tell what was wrong with the oil mill just by walking around. But now he hasn't been to the workshop once and doesn't ask about production." When the millstones broke, the capitalists did not try to repair them, resulting in a decrease in the oil yield; Tongjuxiang used the oil mill's warming room when not doing processing work, but not when doing processing work; Xingdong Oil Mill tightened the millstones when not doing processing work, but loosened them when doing processing work, fearing that they would be damaged (properly tightened millstones would produce more oil). In addition, the comrades in the Harbin office had a simple task-oriented view, and when the task was urgent, they reduced the pressing time, violating operating procedures (reducing it from the normal 12 hours to 6 hours), greatly reducing the oil yield. Just taking the 11,697 tons of soybeans processed from May 1950 to March 1951 as an example, 70,000 jin of soybean oil were lost.

    The Northeast Grain Company's Harbin office not only had a biased understanding of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, but also had a vague understanding of the view of relying on the masses of employees. Although the Harbin office also gave workers rewards when completing tasks, it actually only relied on the capitalists and the resident factory representatives to complete the processing tasks. The Harbin office dispatched resident factory representatives to each factory. Some resident factory representatives adopted passive monitoring methods, some directly managed production, and some even replaced the capitalists in managing production. For example, fearing that soybean oil would leak into the capitalists' oil tanks, the resident factory representatives did not discuss solutions with the workers, but took buckets to collect it themselves, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. As a result, the oil still leaked. In August, when nine oil mills that accepted processing cleaned their oil tanks, they found more than 310,000 jin of soybean oil, all of which had leaked in; some resident factory representatives got up in the middle of the night to shine electric batons on the stacks of oil grass, cutting off the tips (fearing that the oil would flow out), but forgot about relying on the masses; some resident factory representatives walked around in the factory, monitoring production. The workers said, "What's the use of putting on airs? It's better to talk to us." But the resident factory representatives believed: "We entrust private individuals with processing, so we look for the capitalists for everything and there's nothing to talk about with the workers." The workers wanted to move the presses slowly when loading, so that more oil would be produced, but the resident factory representatives told the workers to move them quickly. The workers said, "The resident factory representatives don't know anything, but they act like know-it-alls (act smart)." It can be seen that the resident factory representatives were seriously detached from the masses. The capitalists took this opportunity to provoke the relationship between the workers and the company, saying, "The company doesn't trust the workers anymore." In addition, the trade union did not provide enough education to the workers, causing the workers to have antagonistic emotions towards the company. Some individual workers even did not believe that the company and the workers were one family.

    The Northeast Grain Company's Harbin office's violation of processing policies and failure to rely on the working class resulted in great losses of state property. According to incomplete statistics, from February to July 1951, the capitalists' false reporting of costs resulted in a loss of 2.43 billion yuan of state property; shutdowns and waiting for materials due to untimely allocation of raw materials resulted in a loss of 160 million yuan; and leakage and reduced soybean oil due to improper management methods or a simple task-oriented view amounted to 380,000 jin. Other losses that cannot be verified and serious waste are even impossible to calculate. These losses could have been avoided. However, the Harbin office did not pay attention to these issues and adopted an indifferent attitude.

    From these problems, it can be seen that the Northeast Grain Company's Harbin office, in the implementation of processing policies and processing management, did not promote the active operation of private capital, increased production and conservation, avoided waste, and improved the old management system; instead, it trusted the capitalists without principle and did not rely on the working class, causing huge economic and political losses to state-owned enterprises.

    The Northeast Grain Company should inspect and improve this situation, strengthen the management of private enterprises' processing, and make private enterprises develop in the correct direction that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and serve the national economy.

    东北粮食公司哈尔滨办事处
    违反加工政策坐视奸商侵蚀国家财产
    有关机关应加强对私营企业的管理并纠正这种错误行为
    东北粮食公司哈尔滨办事处，在委托私营油坊业加工的政策上，发生严重的偏向，使国家财产遭受到很大的损失。
    东北粮食公司哈尔滨办事处给资方的加工费，除了按资方的正当开支加百分之十五的利润外，并把资方自报的不正当的开支也计算进去了。因此，资方自报的成本越高，按比例所得的利润就越多。哈尔滨办事处坐视资方侵蚀国家财产。从一九五一年二月到七月，资方虚报每片豆饼需煤五斤到五斤半，汽缸油六分五，消耗品合七十元。经查账修改，每片豆饼只需煤四斤二两，汽缸油二分六一；消耗品合二十八元。从一九五一年二月到七月，哈尔滨办事处共给国家损失了二十四亿三千三百多万元人民币，其中只煤一项就损失了三千吨。其他项目，如：机器折旧，账上一天合五万八千八百二十元，而合同则订十二万四千八百五十元。资方甚至把捐献飞机大炮钱也加在“成本”里（永生合经理陈振山谈）。资方看到有空子可钻，一方面设法取得非法利润，另一方面拚命扩大资产阶级的反动影响。资方挑拨工人和工会、公司之间的关系，使公私关系和劳资关系形成不正常的状态。资方常以“照顾”工人福利的面目出现，拉拢工人说：“只要公司同意，有你就有我。”公司向资方提出批评时，资方就对工人说：“别这样啦，公司又有意见啦。”资方就用这办法使工人对公司不满，自己装“好人”。工人去开会的车费、饭费，资方也给；甚至工会已给了，资方再给一份，然后把这些算在“成本”里。又如恒祥东的资方，要求给工人增加奖励金；兴东油坊的资方、双合盛的经理、义昌信的经理等，带头要求给工人增加工资，说工人工资不多（实际已高于公营企业）；资方在年关给工人津贴，又给工人加工资。明明是资方想从提高成本来增加利润，资方反而说：工会和政府限制工人的要求。资方大量挥霍浪费，把工人每人每月伙食费提高到一百二十分到一百三十分，剩下的饭菜很多，拿去喂猪喂狗都喂不了，甚至往厕所里扔。和聚公油坊国庆节请工人家属吃饭、看戏（包厢），用的钱都算在“成本”里；工厂电灯昼夜不闭，浪费现象到处可见。在这种情况下，资方只考虑怎样提高“成本”，对经营管理采取消极的态度，毫不关心生产。如：同成合的经理，过去对生产很关心，又有经验，工人说：“他到油坊走一圈，就知道少出油的毛病。可是现在他没有下过一趟车间，不问生产。”碾子坏了，资方也不设法修理，因而出油率降低；同聚祥在不做加工活时使用油坊暖豆室，做加工活时就不用；兴东油坊不做加工活时把碾子紧一紧，做加工活时就松一松，怕弄坏了碾子（碾子紧得适当就多出油）。加之哈尔滨办事处的同志有单纯任务观点，任务紧急时，就减少压饼时间，破坏操作规程（从正常状态十二小时，减少到六小时），油率大大减少。只拿一九五○年五月到一九五一年三月加工的一万一千六百九十七吨大豆来计算，就少出豆油七万斤。
    东北粮食公司哈尔滨办事处不但掌握公私兼顾政策有偏向，而且对于依靠职工群众的观点，也是认识模糊的。哈尔滨办事处虽然也在完成任务时给工人以奖励，但实际上是仅仅依靠资方和驻厂员来完成加工任务。哈尔滨办事处在各厂都派有驻厂员。有的驻厂员采取消极的监视方法，有的直接管理生产，有的甚至代替资方管理生产。如怕豆油漏在资方的油囤里，驻厂员不和工人商量办法，便自己拿桶去接，引起工人不满。结果，油还是漏了。八月份，九家接受加工的油坊清理油囤时，发现多了三十一万多斤豆油，都是漏进去的；有的驻厂员半夜起来用电棒照垛子，拿剪子剪油草尖（怕油流到外边），却忘掉了依靠群众；有的驻厂员在工厂里走来走去，监视生产。工人说：“拿臭架子干啥，倒不如和我们谈谈。”而驻厂员竟认为：“我们委托私人加工，一切找资方，和工人谈不上。”工人上榨时要慢点搬榨才能多出油，而驻厂员却叫工人快点搬。工人说：“驻厂员什么也不懂，硬充明公（自作聪明）。”可见驻厂员严重地脱离了群众。资方就趁此挑拨工人和公司之间的关系说：“公司不相信工人了。”加之工会对工人教育不够，使工人和公司有对立情绪。甚至有个别工人不相信公司和工人是一家人。
    东北粮食公司哈尔滨办事处违反加工政策和不依靠工人阶级，使国家财产损失很大。据不完全统计，自一九五一年二月到七月，由于资方谎报成本，损失国家财产二十四亿三千三百多万元；因调拨原料不及时而停工待料，损失一亿六千万元，因管理方法不当或单纯任务观点而漏掉和少出的豆油，就有三十八万斤。其他无凭据可查考的和严重浪费的损失，更是无法计算。这些损失都是可以避免的。而哈尔滨办事处对这些问题并没有注意，采取了漠不关心的态度。
    从这些问题看，东北粮食公司哈尔滨办事处在执行加工政策上和加工管理上，不是促进私人资本积极经营，增产节约，避免浪费，改善旧的管理制度；而是无原则地信任资方，不依靠工人阶级，使国家企业在经济上、政治上遭受了巨大损失。
    东北粮食公司应检查和改进这样的情况，加强对私营企业的加工管理，使私营企业向有利于国计民生的正确方向发展，为国家经济服务。
