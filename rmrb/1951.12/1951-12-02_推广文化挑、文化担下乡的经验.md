A Brief Review of the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea

    The "Culture Pick" and "Culture Carrier" created by the Department of Culture and Education of Zhejiang Province and the People's Cultural Center of Xing County, Shanxi Province, are good ways to carry out patriotic propaganda and education to the broad masses of peasants in the scattered rural areas. The staff of this "Culture Pick" or "Culture Carrier" provides the masses of peasants with popular and educational picture books, pictures, pictorials, and popular reading materials, and at the same time conducts current affairs propaganda to the masses. The "Culture Pick" of Zhejiang Province is also equipped with gramophones and slides, and the "Culture Carrier" of the Xing County Cultural Center in Shanxi Province also sells popular books and periodicals on behalf of the local Xinhua Bookstore. These are all unanimously welcomed by the masses of peasants.
    With the development of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, the demands of the masses of peasants for caring about current affairs, learning politics, and learning culture are very urgent. However, rural transportation is inconvenient, and the supply of spiritual food is relatively difficult. Especially in remote villages, it is difficult to buy, borrow, and see the books and periodicals needed. The "Culture Pick" and "Culture Carrier" are good ways to meet the needs of the masses of peasants. People's Cultural Centers in various places can hold this kind of work.
    The "Culture Pick" or "Culture Carrier" should closely cooperate with the central task of the local area at that time. The books and periodicals going to the countryside must be strictly selected, and the staff should also be trained to enable them to undertake the task of propaganda and education to the masses. Such a "Culture Pick" or "Culture Carrier" will be welcomed by local cadres and the masses of peasants. At the same time, this "Culture Pick" or "Culture Carrier" should contact the local state-owned bookstore to promote popular reading materials for the bookstore and help the bookstore understand the needs of the masses for book publishing and distribution, so that the work content of the "Culture Pick" or "Culture Carrier" can be enriched.

### 推广文化挑、文化担下乡的经验

    推广文化挑、文化担下乡的经验
    浙江省文教厅和山西省兴县人民文化馆所创造的“文化挑”和“文化担”，是在分散的农村中向广大农民群众进行爱国主义宣传教育的一种良好的方式。这种“文化挑”或“文化担”的工作人员，供给农民群众所喜爱的富有教育意义的连环画、图片、画报和通俗读物，同时向群众进行时事宣传。浙江的“文化挑”并备有留声机和幻灯，山西兴县文化馆的“文化担”并为当地新华书店代销通俗书刊，这些，都受到农民群众的一致欢迎。
    随着抗美援朝、镇压反革命和土地改革运动的开展，农民群众关心时事、学习政治、学习文化的要求非常迫切。但农村交通不便，精神食粮的供应比较困难，特别是在偏僻的乡村，很难买到、借到和看到所需的书刊。“文化挑”、“文化担”正是满足农民群众这种要求的好办法。各地的人民文化馆，都可以举办这种工作。
    “文化挑”或“文化担”，应该紧密地配合当地当时的中心任务展开活动。下乡的书刊必须经过严格的选择，工作人员也要加以训练，使之能担负起向群众进行宣传教育的任务。这样的“文化挑”或“文化担”，才会获得地方干部与农民群众的欢迎。同时，这种“文化挑”或“文化担”，应与当地的国营书店取得联系，为书店推销通俗读物并帮助书店了解群众对书刊出版发行工作的要求，使“文化挑”或“文化担”的工作内容丰富起来。
