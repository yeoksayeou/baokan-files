    East China Summarizes Donation Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 12th] All provinces, cities, and districts in East China have completed their semi-annual patriotic production and weapon donation plans ahead of schedule and with over-fulfillment. The East China General Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association issued a notice on the 11th regarding summarizing the donation campaign. The notice stated: As of November 30th, the actual donations collected in the East China region reached 1,679,662,200,000 yuan, enough to buy 1,119 fighter planes. The notice pointed out: The pledge work in all provinces, cities, and districts should be declared completed immediately. After rapidly completing the clearing of donation accounts, all localities should ensure that all donations are deposited into the People's Bank of China, investigate and hold accountable any instances of misappropriation and embezzlement. At the same time, all localities should, with grassroots organizations that have established patriotic pacts as units, conduct a mass summary of the patriotic production and donation campaign. In addition to paying attention to commending models who have completed their donation tasks, emphasis should be placed on commending examples of in-depth patriotic education and promotion of production increases, so as to once again encourage the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses and further develop the movement to increase production and practice economy through this summary.
