Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

The Soviet delegation believes that the work of the subcommittee has achieved some positive results. The subcommittee has helped to clarify the positions of each of the four delegations, helped to more clearly define their intentions and the goals they have set for themselves, and eliminated some differences, although these differences are relatively minor. But the Soviet delegation believes that this is a successful aspect of the subcommittee's work, and it would be incorrect not to mention this positive aspect of the subcommittee's work, just as it would be incorrect to overestimate the importance of the work completed by the subcommittee, because the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France on more important issues remain essentially the same, and the resolution of these issues can be said without exaggeration to be what the people of the world expect from us. This is the unsuccessful aspect of the subcommittee's work. But what the subcommittee has not been able to do must be completed by the Twelve-Nation Committee, the Political Committee, the United Nations General Assembly, and the entire United Nations.

Our lofty task is to overcome and eliminate the differences on major issues, and because of the importance and significance of these issues, they must in any case be elevated to their proper position. That is why the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to discuss these issues in detail. The Soviet delegation does not want to talk about everything that the subcommittee has studied, but believes it is necessary to talk about the most important things.

**The US-UK-France "Proposal" Stipulates "Disarmament" as the Goal, While the Three Countries' Military Power Becomes Increasingly Large**

I will start with the second paragraph of the memorandum, which talks about common goals. The memorandum states: The suggestions of both sides—here the suggestions refer to the suggestions made in the US, UK, and French proposal and in the Soviet delegation's amendments—are consistent in some of the common goals they strive to achieve. The memorandum cites the Soviet delegation's agreement with the first paragraph of the preamble to the "Three-Nation" proposal as evidence, which states: The General Assembly hopes "to relieve the people of all countries in the world from the burden of increasing arms expansion, eliminate the fear of war, and free new capabilities and resources for positive plans for revival and development."

In agreeing to this formulation, the Soviet Union fully understood its significance and recognized the responsibility placed upon it by the important obligation mentioned above—to relieve the people of all countries in the world from the burden of increasing arms expansion and to free new capabilities and resources for positive work of revival and development. This is an important obligation.

Similarly, every country that accepts this formulation must draw corresponding conclusions from it in terms of its entire foreign policy. The Soviet delegation, I believe, the delegations of all countries, those who sincerely undertake this obligation and are willing to resolutely fulfill this obligation to the end, have much work to do to help promote the lofty goal mentioned above and ensure that it is possible to achieve this goal.

There can be no contradiction between this goal and the methods that guarantee its achievement. If there is a contradiction here, it only shows that these methods are not suitable for achieving the above goals, and therefore, other methods must be found.

When people take on the obligation stated in the first paragraph of the preamble to the "Three-Nation" proposal to relieve the people of all countries in the world from the burden of increasing arms expansion and eliminate the fear of war, they must ask themselves: How can this task be completed—the task of relieving the people of all countries from the burden of arms expansion, especially the burden of increasingly expanding arms? How can the people of all countries eliminate the fear of war? How can new capabilities and resources be freed for the revival and development of countries? From this, it can also be concluded that if these questions are not answered, or if only ambiguous or even incorrect answers are given to these questions, then there will be no progress whatsoever.

But if correct answers are to be given to the above questions, then it is necessary to look at what is happening in the world—in today's world, military power is becoming increasingly large, and the burden that military power brings to the people of all countries is becoming increasingly heavy. How did this situation come about? What are the reasons for this phenomenon? What methods can and must be used to eliminate this phenomenon? We do not want to repeat the many facts that we have listed here, which have fully answered this question. We believe that it is only necessary to repeat the fact that the governments of the three countries that put forward this proposal have no facts, no materials, and therefore no basis to deny that they themselves and their allies in the North Atlantic Group are frantically expanding their military power in their own countries and expanding their military power on an ever-expanding scale. This situation will inevitably cause the people of these countries to bear a heavy burden, and will never reduce this burden in the slightest. On the other hand, they have no facts, no materials, and therefore no basis to say that it seems as if the Soviet Union and the countries friendly to the Soviet Union are engaging in arms expansion. Is it necessary to mention more? We can put forward many facts, because even in the period from the beginning of the work of the subcommittee to the end of the subcommittee and the resumption of work by the First Committee, many new facts have occurred that eloquently confirm my previous assertion.

Understanding this makes it easy to judge who should and must bear the responsibility for creating the current situation.

The first paragraph of the preamble is very important. The first conclusion that should be drawn from this paragraph is that we have a responsibility to take effective measures to stop the arms expansion movement, reduce armaments and armed forces, prohibit atomic weapons, and establish international supervision. In this way, the people of the world will be relieved from the burden of arms expansion. In this way, the people of the world can escape danger, or as the preamble to the three-nation proposal says, eliminate the fear of war.

But are the governments of the three countries that put forward the proposal on this issue really willing to put this into practice?

In the past, when we answered this question in the subcommittee, we were sincere, and here I must repeat this answer with the same sincerity: no, they are not willing. These three countries are not prepared to implement what they suggested in the preamble, in the first paragraph of the preamble to the "Three-Nation" proposal. The debates in the subcommittee and the efforts of the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to evade a positive solution to this problem particularly clearly prove this point. I am now going to talk about the most important differences, which, for the reasons we have pointed out earlier, and for the reasons I want to put forward later, were not resolved in the subcommittee.

**The Soviet Union's Proposal Puts Forward Specific Measures for Prohibiting Atomic Weapons, Establishing International Control, and Disarmament**

Currently, the most important issue in the entire problem is the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing an international supervision system. The subcommittee spent a lot of time and energy on this issue, analyzing the proposals of the three countries and our proposals in detail, but did not reach any agreement.

Yesterday, Mr. Lloyd temporarily changed his mind on this issue, and he advocated narrowing the entire issue down to one aspect—becoming an issue of prohibiting atomic weapons while also establishing international control agencies. Of course, this is an important issue, but when Mr. Lloyd spoke on behalf of the three delegations, he did not talk about anything in explaining these delegations' attitude towards this issue; this is undoubtedly unfaithful to the principle of objectivity, which he himself praised so highly when discussing the work of the subcommittee here.

In essence, the entire issue is very important, not just one aspect.

The Soviet Union demands, and firmly demands, that the General Assembly adopt a decision declaring an unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establishing strict international supervision to ensure the implementation of this prohibition; at the same time, it firmly demands that the General Assembly draft a draft convention stipulating the methods for implementing this decision and submit it to the Security Council for consideration before February 1, 1952. This demand is contained in the Soviet delegation's amendments to the second and third paragraphs of the preamble and in the third paragraph of this amendment—the Soviet delegation suggests that this be included in the three-nation proposal.

The Soviet Union suggests that the General Assembly adopt two proposals at the same time, or more correctly, take two decisions in one proposal: one is to ban atomic weapons and establish an international control agency; the other is to draft a convention stipulating practical measures to ensure the implementation of the General Assembly's resolution on banning atomic weapons and establishing strict international supervision. The Soviet Union's opinion is not limited to this, it also demands that armaments and armed forces be reduced immediately, and for this purpose it suggests implementing two measures:

The first measure: Within one year of the adoption of this resolution, the five major powers of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France should reduce their armaments and armed forces by one-third. The second measure: Convene a world conference of all countries (whether members of the United Nations or non-members) to review the issue of substantial reductions in armaments and armed forces, as well as to take practical measures to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international supervision to ensure the implementation of this prohibition.

Therefore, according to the Soviet Union's proposal, the following three issues must be resolved simultaneously:

1. Unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and establish an international control agency;
2. Reduce the armaments and armed forces of the five major powers;
3. Convene a world conference to enable all other countries to achieve this goal.

This is why Mr. Lloyd was absolutely wrong to insist yesterday that the Soviet Union wanted to separate the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons from the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces. The Soviet Union's amendments to the three-nation proposal illustrate the organic relationship between these measures. On this issue, Mr. Lloyd was also not objective in describing the Soviet Union's position on the issue of reducing armaments.

**The US-UK-France Oppose Banning Atomic Weapons, Absurdly Proposing to Establish International Control First**

The governments of the United States, Britain, and France do not agree with this suggestion. They oppose it, thinking that this suggestion is some kind of trap set by the Soviet Union. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France believe that in order not to fall into this trap, they must wait until the international control agency is established and begins to operate before banning atomic weapons. They believe that otherwise, the entire issue will become just a promise to ban atomic weapons without any possibility of determining whether this promise will be truly fulfilled.

This consideration cannot be considered convincing either. The resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, especially when they are unanimously adopted, cannot be regarded as worthless, nor can they be regarded as empty words; they cannot be said to be meaningless in the future. As for the Soviet Union, we believe, and we declare extremely firmly and clearly: even without any sanctions, we will consider this resolution to be completely binding on us, and such sanctions will be stipulated for those countries that do not want to implement or want to undermine this resolution.

But let us temporarily accept the viewpoint of the drafters of the three-nation proposal for the time being. Let us assume for the moment that everyone agrees that an international supervision agency must first be established, as suggested by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, and that it must be put into operation before the ban on atomic weapons and all matters arising therefrom can be implemented. We do not want to repeat that, from the Soviet Union's point of view, this decision is absolutely incorrect because it cannot achieve the goals we hope to achieve. However, if the General Assembly is to act exactly as the United States, Britain, and France insist, in this situation, the following question inevitably arises: what kind of international supervision system do the governments of the three countries (the United States, Britain, and France) suggest establishing? What do they think must be established and put into operation to ensure—as they say—an international supervision system for the prohibition of atomic weapons?

We know what answer this question can get, will get, and has already gotten now. We know that the answer is the Baruch Plan, which they are promoting as a United Nations plan, and which the governments of the three countries—the United States, Britain, and France—insist on, without budging an inch. True, they have said that if there is a better plan than the Baruch Plan, they are willing to study it. But they immediately added that there is no better plan, and they are unwilling to leave the so-called Baruch Plan one step.

We do not agree with this opinion. The shortcomings of this plan have been fully proven, and even those who have desperately defended this plan in the past have admitted these shortcomings. For example, on December 1 this year, "The Times" pointed out in an article entitled "Disarmament" that the benefits of this plan have not been proven, calling this plan a utopian plan, and not concealing such an important situation: in fact, the United States is as difficult to accept this plan as the Soviet Union. "The Times" said that in fact, the United States is as difficult to accept this utopian proposal as the Soviet Union. Is this not an irrefutable evaluation of whether this proposal is feasible? Or more precisely, is this not proof that this proposal has no practical significance? In this situation, the question naturally arises: even "The Times" believes that this plan is worthless, believes that it is utopian, and in fact even the United States itself, which put forward this plan, cannot accept it, then why do the governments of the United States, Britain, and France still support the Baruch Plan?

When talking about the Baruch Plan, people must also think about the specific characteristics of this plan, such as the famous phased system. The phased system is specifically designed to enable the United States to maintain the favorable conditions it believes it possesses for manufacturing atomic weapons in any situation, even after an international control agency has been established and this agency has begun to operate, and after the so-called ban on atomic weapons has been implemented. The significance of this phased system is that after a convention banning atomic weapons has been signed or a decision banning atomic weapons has been adopted in some other way, the secrets of someone are not immediately made public, the production of atomic weapons is not immediately prohibited, but this issue is dragged on to the later stage, dragged on to the final stage—it can be asserted, dragged on to the final final stage, dragged on to the time that will never come.

Only simple-minded people cannot see through the entire treacherous conspiracy of this phased system, the so-called system of gradually "reporting and reviewing." The governments of the United States, Britain, and France tirelessly talk about this system, but do not really hope to "report" and "review" the most important and most dangerous weapons of mass destruction of mankind.

In essence, the arguments put forward by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France against the immediate prohibition of atomic weapons are later left with only one, that is, the fear that a certain country will violate this decision, not implement this decision, and the fear that other well-intentioned countries will be in a position unfavorable to their three countries. However, fear often misleads people. In general daily affairs, it is easy to mislead people; in political issues, it misleads people even more. Fear makes people confused, leads people astray, and takes wrong actions.

However, they also tell us that we cannot listen to other people's words. However, the Soviet Union has not suggested that anyone listen to other people's words, and it itself will not listen to other people's words. It is precisely because of this that the Soviet Union believes that strict international supervision must be established. According to the Soviet Union's view, international supervision must truly be international, not like the view of the instigators of the Baruch Plan. Baruch clearly expressed the views of these people, saying that the personnel in this agency should be as international as possible!

The West is in a difficult situation because it refuses to agree to an immediate unconditional ban on atomic weapons, or at least refuses to agree in principle. In order to get rid of their difficult situation somewhat, they say that the ban can only be announced when international supervision has been established and formally implemented.

**The US's So-Called Control Plan is an Attempt to Buy Time to Accumulate More Heinous Weapons**

Mr. Lloyd said that the Soviet Union insists that there must be a period of time between the two tasks of banning atomic weapons and establishing international supervision. Yes, such a period of time is indeed necessary, and due to the nature of this matter, this period of time is inevitable. Even those who put forward the Baruch Plan themselves have admitted this. Baruch at least said on June 14, 1946, when talking about the so-called development stage, that after the regulations of the control agency are approved, there must be ample time to finally organize this supervision agency and supervision system and put this agency into operation. He also said that the production of atomic bombs can only be stopped after the system of supervising atomic energy is truly implemented.

Five years have passed since he said this, but the hope of establishing international supervision based on the Baruch Plan has completely vanished. The situation in this regard is completely hopeless to change, especially because, as we have already seen above, there are fewer and fewer supporters and sympathizers of the Baruch Plan. However, even at that time, five years ago, it was impossible to reach an agreement on the Baruch Plan's proposed solution to the atomic weapons problem, and his method was fiercely criticized and opposed by many countries. However, let us assume for the moment that one day, the convention banning atomic weapons and establishing international supervision is signed and ratified by all countries. At this time, it will immediately take effect, so the regulations prohibiting atomic weapons will also take effect, so it can be said to have become a fact, not to mention the moral and political consequences, but solely based on the various legal consequences arising therefrom.

What are these consequences?

The most important thing here is that all countries that have ratified this convention must immediately stop manufacturing atomic weapons, especially stop using this weapon; immediately use the atomic bombs that have already been manufactured only for civilian purposes. According to all international rules and international practices, these are the two consequences that arise after the convention banning atomic weapons and establishing international supervision has been signed, ratified, and taken effect. However, if we follow the views of the proposers of the three-nation proposal, even if this convention has been ratified and has taken effect, it still cannot be implemented because we still have to wait for the entire international control agency to be established, wait for the necessary personnel to be selected, and wait for the entire agency to begin to operate. But will this agency really begin to operate? If so, then when exactly? They are silent on this point. However, if it cannot be guaranteed that this agency can truly begin to operate within the prescribed time, then the entire convention and the prohibition of atomic weapons will be suspended in mid-air.

We have long asked everyone to pay attention to the fact that the so-called international control agency planned by Acheson, Baruch, and Lilienthal will essentially be an American atomic super-trust, and its policies will only conform to American policies, even regardless of the policies of Britain—according to the authoritative statements of the British Prime Minister, Britain has now become the main American atomic base—let alone take care of the policies of France. In a word, it only conforms to American policies. If the United States allows something else to happen, it will inevitably risk losing control over the entire atomic energy issue.

We remember that when objective people who did not need to use the international control agency for their own purposes analyzed the Baruch Plan, the unanimous conclusion was: in general, the purpose of the Baruch Plan is to hinder the solution of the entire issue of prohibiting atomic weapons.

Acheson's 1946 report on the international control of atomic energy can also confirm this conclusion. I have also pointed out before that he bluntly said in that attachment that even after the Baruch Plan is put into effect, it cannot be considered a promise to immediately prohibit atomic weapons, although this necessity may arise later. No matter when the decision to prohibit atomic weapons is adopted, it must be considered in conjunction with the highest policy related to American security, and it must be considered by the American government in light of all the facts of the international situation and go through constitutional procedures.

What does this mean? This means that if the Baruch Plan is adopted, if the Baruch Plan (which stipulates that the international control agency should be established in accordance with the methods it suggests) is implemented, the United States can not prohibit atomic weapons after this plan is implemented. In other words, even after international supervision begins to be implemented, if the interests of the United States, if the so-called highest interests of American policy do not require the prohibition of atomic weapons, or require a completely opposite decision, the United States can not announce the prohibition of atomic weapons.

What does it mean to put forward such a suggestion in the words I just quoted, which Acheson has neither denied nor corrected, and which is attached with such reservations as are contained in documents such as Acheson's letter to then-US Secretary of State Byrnes? What does it mean to make us believe that the Soviet Union's suggestion—which advocates prohibiting atomic weapons and instructing the Twelve-Nation Committee to draft a convention, which stipulates both international supervision and specific measures for implementing this prohibition—is utopian and unrealistic, while the suggestion that stipulates establishing international supervision first is realistic? This means: this plan must be based on the Baruch Plan. If this plan is adopted, it can really be said that all the good words have been said, but only one thing is not said, that is, this plan or this convention will immediately prohibit atomic weapons as soon as it takes effect. This point will not be mentioned in the American plan! In the official documents of the United States, the entire issue depends on considerations of the highest policy related to American security, depends on American constitutional procedures, and the international situation. According to Acheson's memorandum, this issue should be resolved with reference to the international situation.

However, this formula conceals certain reservations, which, even after the control agency has been established and begun to operate, will only make this agency embark on the road most likely to succumb to some kind of pressure. These reservations will make it possible for the United States to protect itself, using the highest policy and the international situation as excuses, and not be subject to any supervision by this so-called international control agency.

We put forward a clear and simple solution: prohibit atomic weapons.

Who has this weapon now? The United States and the Soviet Union.

We say clearly and firmly: "Prohibit atomic weapons." And we undertake the obligation to realize this point.

They tell us: "No, we cannot adopt your opinion, accept our plan—the Baruch Plan." However, the only reason they tell us this is that they know that the Baruch Plan they suggest will never allow atomic weapons to be prohibited. The only reason they say this is to buy time so that they can accumulate more and more of this heinous weapon!

They are presenting us with an absurd plan, the prestige of which has been damaged even among those who previously enthusiastically supported it, for example, "The Times," and is it only "The Times"?

Therefore, we say that although the "Three-Nation" proposal puts forward the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons, the entire issue of prohibiting atomic weapons depends on the establishment of an international control agency, and the start of this international agency's activities depends on the highest policy and the actual conditions of international relations. This formulation is just a smokescreen that can only be used to deceive the people. However, you say that you do not want to deceive. Then, let us turn these wishes into actions that everyone can see, so that, as the first paragraph of the preamble says, we can truly show the people the true situation, make them more and more calm, relieve them of the fear that they and their families, they and their children will be destroyed, and relieve them of the fear of war.

**The US, Britain, and France Will Actually Continue to Pursue Military Plans and Military Actions Regardless of Any Agreement**

We say that the way the US, Britain, and France propose the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and supervision is incorrect. On the one hand, the prohibition of atomic weapons depends on the establishment of an international control agency; on the other hand, a plan is proposed for the establishment of this agency that:
   (1) Has aroused great opposition and negative evaluations from some countries and from agencies and experts on atomic energy issues in the United States, Britain, and other countries;
   (2) Has been rejected by several countries, which disagree with this plan and firmly advocate a plan that can truly guarantee the establishment of an international supervision agency, guarantee compliance with the basic standards of international law, and guarantee that national sovereignty is respected.

Therefore, the work of prohibiting atomic weapons depends on the establishment of an international control agency, and the establishment of an international control agency depends on whether the Baruch Plan is adopted, and whether the Baruch Plan is adopted depends on the highest policy and other various reservations; this suggestion forms a true vicious cycle, and there is no way to escape this cycle.

However, a way out must be found. This way out may be for the United Nations General Assembly to immediately announce an unconditional ban on atomic weapons, establish an international control agency, and instruct the Twelve-Nation Committee (we have agreed in the subcommittee to establish this committee to replace the original two committees) to draft a convention stipulating measures to ensure the implementation of this ban. Refusing to adopt this suggestion is precisely refusing to break the deadlock, which, in some respects, is being deliberately created by people, and in some respects, has already been created. This deadlock has lasted for five years now, and it is now time to break this situation.

Our straightforward question is: Do the proposers of the "Three-Nation" proposal agree that the United Nations General Assembly should announce an unconditional ban on atomic weapons and establish strict international supervision to ensure the implementation of this ban? Mr. Lloyd did not answer this question, he only said a lot of ambiguous words, saying something like "The United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the three-nation proposal obviously also means announcing its advocacy of unconditionally banning atomic weapons through strict international supervision." The work of the subcommittee has shown that these ambiguous words are actually used to conceal the intention to refuse the suggestion to ban atomic weapons. Nevertheless, the work of the subcommittee is still useful because it has helped to expose the kind of thinking that Mr. Lloyd originally intended to conceal with diplomatic rhetoric.

We must face the truth and admit the facts.

The fact is this: even if the suggestion to ban atomic weapons and the detailed regulations on international supervision are contained in the same convention, international supervision cannot begin to take effect at the same time as the convention is signed, but will only take effect after a certain period of time. This period of time is necessary for a whole set of complex organizational work, and without this complex organizational work, this international control agency cannot operate. Those who have no intention of prohibiting atomic weapons have seized on the situation created by the nature of this matter itself, and their purpose is to delay the cessation of atomic weapons production and the ban on atomic weapons, delaying all of this until the control agency begins to operate. However, judging from the current situation of things, there is no sign that can make people believe that regulations will be made to guarantee that this control agency can generally begin to operate. They tell us that our suggestion means banning first and supervising later. This is wrong, because we say: a decision to prohibit atomic weapons and establish international supervision must be taken at the same time, and then all the moral and political obligations arising from this decision must be fulfilled. In fact, it is precisely the suggestion contained in the "Three-Nation" proposal that refuses to prohibit atomic weapons before the international supervision system begins to take effect. The meaning of this suggestion is: even if all countries agree that atomic weapons must be banned and international supervision must be established, they can still continue to produce atomic weapons regardless of this agreement, and even continue to use atomic weapons, while continuing to promote their military plans, and, more seriously, continue to carry out their military actions against the people of other countries.

It should also be added that their argument is: a decision to ban atomic weapons before the international control agency begins to work will create a loophole, and the result will be that banning atomic weapons will become a false and deceptive means. This argument is fundamentally illogical. Because, this deceptive means will definitely be exposed, and it will definitely bring eternal shame to the country that takes this unjust action.

**The Soviet Union's Suggestion That the General Assembly Announce a Ban on Atomic Weapons Conforms to the Inner Wishes of Hundreds of Millions of People**

There is another situation that must also be pointed out here, that is, although there is no convention banning the use of atomic weapons yet, countries that possess atomic weapons have not used atomic weapons in many places when launching military actions in accordance with their policies, although some madmen are instigating the use of atomic weapons now. If this is not out of moral considerations, then it is clearly out of considerations of common sense, prudence, and the psychology of fearing that the use of atomic weapons may cause irreparable consequences, which is restraining those who want to carry out dangerous adventures and preventing them from taking this step.

World War II has already provided examples showing that certain moral, political, and other—I would like to say—business considerations have even prevented those who are legally unbound by the Hague Convention from using poison gas against the enemy.

Why is all of this forgotten now when discussing the prohibition of atomic weapons? Why is it that now, when the General Assembly is about to announce the prohibition of atomic weapons and establish international supervision to fulfill its lofty responsibilities, someone is raising such strong objections on the pretext that this decision of the General Assembly may be used by some rash governments to achieve unjust purposes? This pretext is unfounded.

The British representative tried yesterday to portray the Soviet delegation's plan as also a phased plan, but his attempt completely failed. He listed three such stages. The reason why Lloyd opposes this plan is that it stipulates certain stages. Then, why does he agree with the stages of the plan proposed in the three-nation proposal? This is difficult to explain using the laws of logic generally accepted by people. But the problem lies in the fact that our plan does not stipulate any stages. It is not difficult to understand this if you consider the following fact. This fact is: the essence of the phased system is not to transition from one stage to another. If it is transitioning from one stage to another, this is extremely natural, because we cannot do several things at the same time immediately. The problem is: the reason why the phased system is unacceptable is that it stipulates that the transition from one stage to another depends on many prerequisites, which give the agency responsible for this work great leeway to act as it pleases.

Thus, according to the Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal plan, in terms of the prohibition of atomic weapons, the transition from the stage of controlling raw materials to the stage of controlling the production of atomic weapons depends on certain conditions. It is entirely within the scope of the leadership agency's authority to estimate whether these conditions are mature. Therefore, according to the Baruch Plan, the transition from one stage to another is not a natural and unobstructed transition from one state to another, or from one action to another, but is to be decided at will by those responsible for this work.

If the meaning of phasing is merely to complete this work in the necessary order determined by the material aspects of a work, then talking about phasing in this way is absurd and ridiculous. For example, according to Mr. Lloyd's argument yesterday, people can say that breakfast also has several stages, and count these stages, starting from setting the table to eating the last dish.

We believe that the above considerations undoubtedly prove that not only are there differences between the Soviet side and the American, British, and French sides regarding the methods of achieving the common goals mentioned in the memorandum, but the so-called "common goals" are by no means common and consistent. It is necessary to clearly understand the situation that has occurred. In order to make these "common goals" truly common and truly consistent, more work needs to be done, a lot more work needs to be done.

We have not lost hope that we can achieve this in the process of our further unremitting and patient work.

In order to justify our suggestion that the General Assembly should announce an unconditional ban on atomic weapons and establish international supervision, we have pointed out that this decision of the General Assembly will have special moral and political significance. We must also emphasize this point now. This decision of the General Assembly will not be a scrap of paper as some people think, nor will it be empty talk or a deceptive means. The reason why it will not be a scrap of paper, empty talk, or a deceptive means is that it conforms to the inner wishes of hundreds of millions of people, and it can objectively, must, and will definitely help to eliminate or at least ease international tensions, it will contribute to the cause of peace, and combat the policies of warmongers and war adventures.

**The US, Britain, and France's Unreasonable Demands on the Issue of Disarmament Are to Make the United Nations Follow in the Footsteps of the League of Nations**

The second disagreement between the governments of the United States, Britain, and France and the Soviet government is on the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces. The essence of the Soviet Union's suggestion is: the five major powers of the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union should reduce their total armed forces and armaments by one-third within one year. This suggestion has been opposed by the above three countries. However, it should be said that the reasons they have put forward for their opposition on this point are also not at all satisfactory to us. Indeed, they say that if only armaments are reduced, and others do not know what armaments the major powers are reducing and what level they intend to reduce to, then this reduction of armaments cannot be said to be conducive to peace. As for the issue of levels, we have already talked about it in considerable detail. We can simply review the most basic points of this matter. So far, those who have put forward suggestions on levels have not been able to say anything reasonable about the principles for determining levels. Mr. Acheson last tried to do this, but I have already explained last time that his speech was not at all satisfactory. Mr. Acheson then took the size of the national territory and the amount of the population as the basis, believing that these two points should be used as the criteria for determining the levels of each country. The larger the territory of a country and the larger the population, the more armaments and armed forces it should possess. However, Mr. Acheson also said that a certain limit, a certain maximum limit, must be set so that the level cannot exceed this maximum limit. This is equivalent to saying that if the principles on criteria put forward by Mr. Acheson are adopted, and the levels talked about by the American representative last time are adopted, then the quantity of armaments and the quantity of armed forces will be neither commensurate with the size of the territory nor commensurate with the population. Then, people will inevitably ask: what significance does this so-called level have? Moreover, if one starts from this so-called level, doing what the representatives of France, Britain, and the United States explicitly stated at the meeting of the four foreign ministers' assistants in Paris, the final result of this entire problem will not promote the reduction of armaments, but will instead promote the expansion of armaments. In this way, people will inevitably ask, if there will be no reduction of armaments in the end, what value does this level and the entire measure of so-called reduction of armaments have?

The second question raised by the British representative is that it is necessary to know the quantity of armed forces and armaments of each country. We have also fully explained this issue. We have pointed out that if the Soviet Union's suggested method of reducing armaments is adopted, then all the figures on armed forces and armaments can be made public at the conference table immediately. This point can also be seen very clearly from the seventh paragraph of the Soviet amendments. That paragraph says: After the United Nations General Assembly has adopted regulations prohibiting atomic weapons and reducing armaments and armed forces, no later than one month, all countries must submit a complete report to the international control agency, stating the details of their armed forces and all types of armaments (including atomic weapons) at the time of the adoption of the above regulations.

If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France really want to know precise information about Soviet armaments and armed forces, here is the simplest and most convenient way. In that way, Mr. Lloyd, as well as the representatives of the other two countries whom Mr. Lloyd represents together in his speech, will no longer need to cite information that even they themselves admit is not very precise (or, as I say, not at all precise).

Since this is the case, what other reasons do they have to oppose the Soviet Union's suggestion that the five major powers should reduce their armaments and armed forces by one-third? There are none. Perhaps they can still say that reducing armaments in this way will not create a "balance of power," but will leave the so-called Soviet military advantage untouched. However, if even Lloyd himself admits that the figures he cited on Soviet armaments and armed forces are not precise, then how can he talk about the Soviet Union's military advantage? Everyone knows that detailed materials on armaments and armed forces must first be available before it can be decided whether a certain country has a military advantage; without such materials, it is impossible to estimate the military strength of any country.

According to the speeches of the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, we can clearly know that their position on this issue is based on the so-called balance of power doctrine. However, this doctrine has never contributed anything to the cause of peace. What is especially bad is that the so-called "balance of power" has never

    关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器与建立国际管制
    ——维辛斯基一九五一年十二月十二日在联合国大会政治委员会上的演说主席先生，各位代表先生：
    苏联代表团认为小组委员会的工作已获得若干积极的成果。小组委员会帮助弄清楚了四国代表团中每一个代表团的立场是什么，帮助更清楚地确定了它们的意图和它们为自己规定的目标是什么，并消除了若干分歧，虽然这些分歧都是比较不大重要的。但是苏联代表团认为这是小组委员会工作的有成绩的一方面，如果不提到小组委员会工作的这一个积极方面，那将是不正确的，正像过高地估计小组委员会所完成的工作的重要性也是不正确的一样，因为苏联和美、英、法三国在比较重要问题上的分歧在实质上还是依然如故，而这些问题的解决可以毫不夸大地说是全世界人民对我们的期望。这就是小组委员会工作失败的一方面。但是小组委员会所没有能够做到的，必须由十二国委员会、政治委员会、联合国大会、整个联合国来完成。
    我们的崇高的任务就是要克服和消除在重大问题上的分歧，并且由于这些问题的重要性和意义，无论如何必须把它们提高到应有的地位。这就是为什么苏联代表团认为必须详细谈到这些问题的缘故。苏联代表团不想去谈小组委员会所研究的每一件事，但认为必须谈到最重要的事。
    美英法“提案”虽规定“裁军”
    目标而三国军备却越来越庞大
    我将从备忘录的第二段谈起，这一段讲的是共同目标。备忘录说：双方的建议——这里所谈的建议是指美、英、法三国提案中及苏联代表团的修正案中所提出的建议——在某些它们力求达到的共同目标上是一致的。备忘录举出苏联代表团已同意“三国”提案序言的第一段作为证据，这一段说：大会期望“使全世界各国人民免除日益增加的扩张军备的负担，消除战争恐惧，并解放新的能力和资源用在复兴和发展的积极计划上”。
    苏联在同意这种提法时是充分了解到它的意义的，是认识到上面所说的那样的重要义务——使全世界各国人民免除日益增加的扩张军备的负担，并解放新的能力和资源用在复兴和发展的积极工作上——所赋予它的责任的。这是重要的义务。
    同样地每个接受这种提法的国家在整个外交政策方面也必须由此得出相应的结论。苏联代表团，我相信，所有国家的代表团，凡是诚心诚意担当这个义务并愿意坚决地实现这个义务到底的，就有许多工作要做，以便有助于发扬上面所说的这个崇高目标并保证可能达到这个目标。
    在这个目标和那些保证达到这个目标的方法之间是不能有什么矛盾的。如果这里有矛盾发生的话，那只说明了这些方法是不适宜用来达到上述目标的，因此，必须找别的方法。
    人们在把“三国”提案序言第一段所说的使全世界各国人民免除日益增加的扩张军备的负担和消除战争恐惧的义务担当下来的时候，必须问问自己：如何能完成这个任务——使各国人民免除扩张军备的负担，特别是日益增加的扩张军备的负担的任务？如何使各国人民消除战争恐惧？如何解放新的能力和资源用在各国的复兴和发展上？从这里也可以得出结论：如果不答复这些问题，或者对这些问题只提出模棱两可或者甚至不正确的答复，那末，事情就不能有丝毫进展。
    可是如果要对上面的问题作出正确的答案来，那末就必须看一看世界上正在发生什么事情——在今天的世界里，军备是越来越庞大，军备给各国人民所带来的负担是越来越沉重了。怎样造成了这种情形呢？造成这种现象的原因是什么呢？要消除这种现象，可能而且必须使用什么方法呢？现在我们不想重提我们曾在这里列举出来的许多事实，这些事实已经充分地解答了这个问题。我们认为只须重提这个事实，就是：提出这个提案的三国政府根本没有任何事实、任何材料、因而也就没有任何根据使它们可以否认，他们自己和他们的北大西洋集团的盟国正在自己的国内疯狂地扩张军备，并在不断扩大的规模上扩张军备。这种情况当然不可避免地要使这些国家的人民担负沉重的负担，而绝不会使这种负担减轻一点。另一方面，它们没有任何事实、任何材料、因而也就没有任何根据来把事情说得好像是苏联以及与苏联友好的国家正在进行扩张军备。还有必要再提到一些吗？我们是可以提出很多事实来的，因为甚至在小组委员会开始工作到小组委员会结束和第一委员会恢复工作为止这一段时间内，就发生了许多新的事实，它们雄辩地证实了我前面所下的断语。
    明白了这一点，就容易判断究竟是谁才应该而且必须担负造成现在这种情况的责任了。
    序言的第一段是十分重要的。应该从这一段话里得出来的第一个结论就是：我们有责任采取有效的措施来停止扩张军备运动，裁减军备和武装部队，禁止原子武器并建立国际监督。这样，世界各国人民就会免除扩张军备的负担。这样，世界各国人民就可以脱离危险，或者像三国提案的序言上所说的，消除战争恐惧了。
    可是，提出关于这一问题的提案的三国政府真愿意把这一点付诸实行吗？
    过去我们在小组委员会上回答这个问题时，一向是真心诚意的，在这里我也必须以同样的诚意来重复这个回答：不，他们是不愿意的。这三个国家是不预备实行它们在序言中，在“三国”提案序言的第一段里所建议的事情的。小组委员会上的辩论与美、英、法代表的尽力规避以积极的方法来解决这个问题，就特别明白地证明了这一点。我现在要谈到最重要的问题上的分歧了，这些分歧由于我们在以前所指出的原因，由于我想在以后提出的原因，在小组委员会上没有得到解决。
    苏联建议提出了禁止原子武器
    建立国际管制和裁军的具体办法
    目前整个问题中最重要的，是禁止原子武器与建立国际监督制度的问题。小组委员会花了许多时间与精力在这个问题上，详细地分析了三国的建议和我们的建议，但并没有取得任何协议。
    昨天劳埃德先生在这个问题上临时又变了主意，他主张把整个问题缩小成为一个方面——成为一个禁止原子武器，同时又建立国际管制机构的问题。当然这是一个重要的问题，但是当劳埃德先生代表三国代表团发言时，在解释这些代表团对这个问题的态度方面，没有谈到别的；这无疑是不忠实于客观原则，而这个原则又是他在这里讨论小组委员会的工作时推崇备至的。
    实质上，这个问题整个都是非常重要的，不仅只有一方面。
    苏联要求，并且坚决要求大会采取决定，宣布无条件地禁止原子武器，并建立严格的国际监督以保证这项禁令的实行；同时坚决要求大会起草公约草案，规定实行这项决定的办法，并在一九五二年二月一日以前提交安全理事会考虑。这项要求包含在苏联代表团所提修正案中对于序言的第二段与第三段的修正以及这个修正案的第三段里——苏联代表团建议将此列入三国提案。
    苏联建议大会同时通过两个提案，或者更正确地说，在一个提案里采取两个决定：一个是禁用原子武器，建立国际管制机构；另外一个是起草一项公约，规定以实际办法保证实行大会关于禁用原子武器与建立严格的国际监督的决议。苏联的意见不限于这一点，它还要求立刻开始裁减军备与武装部队，并为此建议实行两项办法：
    第一个办法：在通过该决议的一年内，裁减中、美、英、苏、法五大国的军备与武装部队三分之一。第二个办法：召开一切国家（不论是联合国会员国或非会员国）的世界性会议，以审议大量裁减军备与武装部队的问题以及采取实际办法禁止原子武器并建立国际监督以保证实施这种禁令的问题。
    因此，根据苏联的建议，下述三个问题必须同时解决：
    一、无条件禁止原子武器和成立国际管制机构；
    二、裁减五大国的军备和武装部队；
    三、召开世界性会议，使所有其他国家都实现这个目标。
    这就是为什么劳埃德先生昨天硬说苏联要把禁止原子武器和裁减军备与武装部队这两个问题分开来的这种说法是绝对错误的缘故。苏联对于三国提案的修正案说明了这些办法之间的有机关系。在这个问题上，劳埃德先生在述说苏联对于裁减军备问题的立场时，也是不客观的。
    美英法反对禁止原子武器，竟提出先建立国际管制的荒谬主张
    美国、英国和法国的政府不同意这个建议。它们反对它，认为这个建议是苏联设下的某种陷阱。美、英、法三国政府认为：为了不落入这个陷阱，必须等到国际管制机构建立起来并且开始活动时再禁止原子武器。它们认为：否则，整个问题将变成只是禁止原子武器的诺言，而没有任何可能去确定这个诺言是否将真正实现。
    这种考虑也不能认为是令人信服的。联合国大会的决议，特别是在它被一致通过的时候，不能看作是没有价值的，也不能认为是空洞的词句；不能说它将来是毫无意义的。至于苏联，我们认为，并且我们极坚定而明确地宣布：即使没有任何制裁，我们也要认为这个决议对我们是完全有约束力的，而这种制裁将是为那些不想实行或者想破坏这个决议的国家规定的。
    但是我们姑且暂时接受三国提案起草人的观点。我们姑且假定，大家都同意首先必须像美国、英国、法国政府所建议的那样设立国际监督机构，并且使它工作起来，然后才能实施禁止原子武器的禁令以及处理由此而引起的一切事宜。我们不想重提，从苏联的观点来看，这种决定是绝对不正确的，因为它不能达到我们所希望达到的目标。但是，如果大会要完全像美国、英国、法国所坚持的那样去行动，在这样情况下，就不可避免地产生了这样的问题：三国（美国、英国、法国）政府建议成立的是怎么样的国际监督制度？他们认为必须建立并且使它工作起来以确保——像他们所说的那样——禁止原子武器的国际监督制度，又是怎样的呢？
    我们知道这个问题能够得到，将会得到，而且现在已经得到什么答案。我们知道这个答案就是巴鲁区计划，他们正在把这个计划宣传成联合国的计划，三国——美国、英国、法国——政府坚持这个计划，寸步不让。不错，他们曾说，如果有比巴鲁区计划更好的计划，他们愿意加以研究。但是马上他们又补充说，没有更好的计划了，他们不愿离开所谓巴鲁区计划一步。
    我们不同意这种意见。这个计划的缺点已经有了充分的证明，而且连那些在过去拚命为这个计划辩护的人们也承认了这些缺点。例如今年十二月一日“泰晤士报”在“裁减军备”一文中指出这个计划的好处没有得到证明，把这个计划叫做乌托邦的计划，并且毫不掩饰这样重要的情况：事实上，美国正像苏联一样难于接受这个计划。“泰晤士报”说，事实上，美国正像苏联一样难于接受这个乌托邦的建议。这不是对这个建议是否行得通这一点的颠扑不破的评价吗？或者更准确地说，这不是证明了这个建议没有任何实际意义吗？在这样情况下，自然产生了这样的问题：甚至“泰晤士报”也认为这个计划一无是处，认为它是乌托邦的，事实上连提出这个计划的美国自己都不能接受，那末，美国、英国、法国政府仍旧支持巴鲁区计划是什么缘故呢？
    在说到巴鲁区计划的时候，人们必须也想到这个计划的具体特点，像有名的分阶段制之类。分阶段制是特别提出来使美国能够在任何情况下，甚至在建立了国际管制机构和这个机构开始工作以后，在实行了所谓对原子武器的禁令以后，保持美国自认为拥有的制造原子武器的有利条件。这个分阶段制的意义，是要在签订了禁止原子武器的公约或者用某种其他方式通过了禁止原子武器的决定后，不立刻公布某人的秘密，不立刻禁止原子武器的生产，而是把这个问题拖到后来，拖到最后的一个阶段——可以断定，拖到最后最后的一个阶段，拖到永远不会来到的时候。
    只有头脑简单的人才看不透这个分阶段制，所谓逐步地“报告与审查”制的全部奸诈阴谋。美国、英国、法国政府不厌烦地谈到这个制度，然而并不真正希望“报告”和“审查”最重要和最危险的大批屠杀人类的武器。
    从本质上说来，美国、英国、法国政府所提出的反对立刻禁止原子武器的论据到后来只剩下一个，那就是恐怕某一国家会违背这种决定，不执行这个决定，恐怕其他善意的国家会处在对它们三国不利的地位。但是，恐惧常常误人。在一般日常的事情上，它固然容易误人；在政治问题上，则误人更甚。恐惧使人糊涂，使人走上迷途，而采取错误行动。
    然而，他们又对我们说，不能听从别人的话。可是，苏联并没有建议任何人听从别人的话，它自己也不会听从别人的话。正是因为这样，所以苏联才认为必须建立严格的国际监督。按照苏联的见解，国际监督必须真正是国际性的，不能像巴鲁区计划的授意者的见解那样。巴鲁区明白表达了这些人的见解，他说这个机构里的人员应该尽可能是国际性的！
    西方因为拒绝同意马上无条件地禁止原子武器，至少是拒绝在原则上同意，就处于为难的境地。为了多少摆脱一下他们这种为难的处境，他们就说，必须到国际监督已经建立，并且正式实行的时候，才能宣布禁令。
    美国的所谓管制计划是企图争取时间积存更多的凶恶武器
    劳埃德先生说，苏联主张在禁止原子武器和建立国际监督两个工作之间必须要有一段时间。是的，这样一段时间的确是必要的，由于这件事情的性质，这一段时间是免不了的。即使提出巴鲁区计划的人们自己也承认了这一点。巴鲁区至少曾在一九四六年六月十四日谈到所谓发展阶段时说过，在管制机构的章则被批准之后，必须要有一些充裕的时间，才能够最后组织起这个监督机构和监督制度，并使这个机构开始工作。他还说过，只有监督原子能的制度真正实行之后，才能停止原子弹的生产。
    自从他说过这句话之后，至今已经过了五个年头，然而以巴鲁区计划为基础建立国际监督的希望却完全破灭了。这方面的情况是完全没有希望改变的，尤其是因为，像我们上面已经看得出的，巴鲁区计划的支持者和同情者是愈来愈少了。但是，就是在当时，五年以前，也不可能对巴鲁区计划所建议的解决原子武器问题的办法取得协议，他这个办法受到许多国家的激烈指责和反对。但是，我们姑且假定，有一天，禁止原子武器和建立国际监督的公约由各国签字并获得批准。这时，它就立刻生效，因此禁止原子武器的规定也生效了，这样不用说道义和政治后果，单根据由此而产生的种种法律后果，这就可以说是成为一个事实了。
    这是些什么后果呢？
    这里面最重要的就是：一切批准了这个公约的国家必须马上停止制造原子武器，尤其是要停止使用这种武器；马上把已经制成的原子弹只用在民用目的。根据一切国际规则和国际惯例，这就是禁止原子武器和建立国际监督的公约经过签字、批准而生效之后所产生的两个后果。但是，假如我们根据三国提案提案人的见解，这个公约纵然已经批准并已经生效，但仍然不能付诸实行，因为仍然要等待整个国际管制机构设立起来，等待选出必要的人员，等待整个机构开始工作。但是这个机构真的会开始工作吗？如果会，那末，准确地说，要到什么时候呢？在这一点上，他们就一声不响了。然而，如果不能保证这个机构真正能在规定的时间内开始工作，那么整个公约和禁止原子武器都要悬在半空中了。
    我们早就请大家注意，艾奇逊、巴鲁区和李连塞尔所计划的所谓国际管制机构，实质上必然会是一个美国的原子超级托辣斯，它所执行的方针只符合美国的政策，甚至不顾英国——根据英国首相的权威发言，英国现在已成了美国主要的原子基地——的政策，更不用说照顾到法国的政策了。一言以蔽之，就是只符合美国的政策。美国要是容许发生别的情况，就一定有丧失在整个原子能问题上的操纵权之危险。
    我们记得，那些并不需要为一己的目的而利用国际管制机构的客观人士分析巴鲁区计划时，一致的结论是：一般说来，巴鲁区计划的目的在于妨碍整个禁止原子武器问题的解决。
    艾奇逊先生一九四六年关于国际管制原子能的报告的附件也可以证实这种结论。我以前也曾经指出过，他在那附件里露骨地说，在巴鲁区计划付诸实行以后，仍然不能认为是答应马上禁止原子武器，虽然以后可能产生这种必要。无论在什么时候采纳禁止原子武器的决定，总要结合着有关美国安全的最高政策来考虑，要由美国政府考虑到国际形势的一切事实，并经过宪法程序才成。
    这是什么意思呢？这就是说，如果通过了巴鲁区计划，如果巴鲁区计划（这个计划规定要按照它所建议的办法建立国际管制机构）实行了，美国就可以在这个计划实行后不禁止原子武器。换句话说，就是在国际监督开始实行后，如果美国的利益，如果美国政策的所谓最高利益不需要禁止原子武器，或者需要一个截然相反的决定，美国就可以不宣布禁止原子武器。
    用我刚才所引用的而艾奇逊既未否认又未更正的那种词句来提出这样的建议，而且又附有像艾奇逊致当时美国国务卿贝尔纳斯的信这样的文件中所包含的那种保留条件，这是什么意思呢？要使我们相信苏联的建议——这个建议主张禁止原子武器并训令十二国委员会拟订公约，而在这个公约中既规定国际监督，又规定实行这个禁令的具体办法——是空想的和不现实的，相反的，规定先建立国际监督的建议倒是现实的，这又是什么意思呢？这就是说：这个计划必须以巴鲁区计划为基础。这个计划如果获得通过的话，那可真是好话说尽了，但是只有一件事情不说，那就是这个计划或这个公约一生效，就立刻禁止原子武器。美国的计划中是不会谈到这一点的！在美国的官方文件中，整个问题都取决于对有关美国安全的最高政策的考虑，取决于美国的宪法程序以及国际形势，根据艾奇逊的备忘录说，这个问题是应当参照国际形势来解决的。
    但是，这种公式掩盖着某些保留，这种保留即使在管制机构已经建立并开始工作之后，也只会使这个机构走上最易向某种压力屈服的道路。这些保留会使美国有可能来保护它自己，以最高政策和国际形势为藉口，而不受这个所谓国际管制机构的任何监督。
    我们提出明确简单的解决办法：禁止原子武器。
    现在谁有这种武器呢？美国和苏联。
    我们明白而坚定地说：“禁止原子武器。”并且我们把实现这一点的义务担当起来。
    他们告诉我们说：“不，我们不能采纳你们的意见，接受我们的计划——巴鲁区计划吧。”可是，他们所以要这样告诉我们，唯一的原因就是他们知道他们所建议的巴鲁区计划永远不会使原子武器受到禁止。他们所以这样说，只是为了争取时间，以便能够积存起越来越多的这种凶恶的武器！
    他们向我们提出一个荒唐的计划，这个计划的威信，甚至在那些以前热烈支持它的人们中间，也已受到损害了，举例说，“泰晤士报”，而且难道只有“泰晤士报”吗？
    因此，我们说，“三国”提案中虽然提出了禁止原子武器的问题，但是整个禁止原子武器问题要取决于国际管制机构的建立，而这个国际机构的开始活动又要取决于最高政策与国际关系的实况，这种提法，不过是一种遮眼法，只能够用来欺骗人民罢了。可是，你们说你们并不要欺骗。那么，就让我们把这些愿望变成人人都可以看到的有血有肉的行动吧，这样就会像序言第一段中所说的，真正向人民表明真情实况，使他们越来越镇静，使他们免除他们以及他们的家属、他们以及他们的子女将要被毁灭的恐惧，使他们免除战争的恐惧。
    美英法实际上将不顾一切协定
    继续推行军事计划和军事行动
    我们说，美、英、法三国提案中那种对禁止原子武器与监督问题的提法是不正确的。一方面，禁止原子武器要取决于国际管制机构的建立；另一方面，却又提出了建立这个机构的这样一种计划，这种计划：
   （一）引起了某些国家以及美国、英国和其他国家关于原子能问题的机构与专家大大反对，并给予否定性的评价；
   （二）已受到若干国家的拒绝，它们不同意这种计划，坚决主张要有一种能够真正保证国际监督机构的建立、保证遵守国际法的基本标准以及保证国家主权受到尊重的计划。
    因此，禁止原子武器的工作要取决于国际管制机构的建立，国际管制机构的建立又要取决于巴鲁区计划之是否被采纳，而巴鲁区计划之是否被采纳又要取决于最高政策和其他各种各样的保留；这种建议形成一个真正的恶性循环，没有逃出这种循环的
    一条道路。
    可是必须找出一条出路才行。这一条出路，也许就是由联合国大会立刻宣布无条件禁止原子武器，成立国际管制机构并训令十二国委员会（我们已在小组委员会中同意成立这个委员会以代替原有的两个委员会），草拟一项公约，规定采取办法以保证这种禁令的执行。拒绝通过这种建议，正是拒绝打破僵局，这种僵局，在某些方面正在被人们故意地制造着，在某些方面是已经造成了。这种僵局到现在已经持续了五年，现在已经是打破这种局面的时候了。
    我们的直截了当的问题是：“三国”提案的提案人是否同意由联合国大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立严格的国际监督以保证这种禁令的执行呢？劳埃德先生并没有答复这个问题，他只说了一大套含糊其词的话，说什么“联合国大会通过三国提案，显然也就是宣布主张通过严格的国际监督无条件禁止原子武器。”小组委员会的工作表明了：这种含糊其词的话，实际上是用来掩盖拒绝禁止原子武器建议的心意的。虽然如此，小组委员会的工作仍然是有益的，因为它对于揭露劳埃德先生原打算用外交辞令掩饰过去的那种心思，是有帮助的。
    必须面对真理并且承认事实。
    事实是这样的：即使禁止原子武器的建议和关于国际监督的详细规定都包含在同一个公约里面，国际监督仍然不能在签订公约的同时开始生效，而是要经过一定的时间以后才能生效。为了要进行一整套复杂的组织工作，是必须有这一段时间的，而没有这种复杂的组织工作，这种国际管制机构就无法进行活动。无意禁止原子武器的人抓住了由于这种事情本身的性质而造成的情况，他们的目的是对于停止原子武器生产和禁用原子武器一事加以拖延，把这一切都拖延到管制机构开始活动的时候。可是照事情的目前情况看来，怎么也看不出有什么征兆，可以令人相信会作出规定来，保证这种管制机构大体上可以开始活动。他们对我们说，我们的建议的意思是先禁止，后监督。这话说错了，因为我们说：必须同时采取禁止原子武器和建立国际监督的决定，随后再履行由这种决定产生出来的一切道义上和政治上的义务。事实上拒绝在国际监督制度开始生效以前禁止原子武器的，恰恰是“三国”提案中所包含的建议。这个建议的意思是：即使各国都同意必须禁止原子武器并建立国际监督，它们仍然可以不管这种协定而继续生产原子武器，甚至仍然可以使用原子武器，同时继续推行他们的军事计划，而且，更严重的是，继续进行它们反对别国人民的军事行动。
    还应该补充一句，他们的论调是：在国际管制机构开始工作以前就禁止原子武器的决定会造成一个漏洞，结果会使禁止原子武器这件事成了虚假的骗人的手段。这种论调是根本不合逻辑的。因为，这种骗人的手段一定会被人揭穿，一定会使采取这种不义行动的国家永远蒙羞。
    苏联建议大会宣布禁止原子武器，符合亿万人民的内心愿望
    还有一个情况这里也必须指出，就是虽然现在还没有禁止使用原子武器的公约，但是拥有原子武器的国家依照其政策在许多地方发动军事行动时也没有使用原子武器，虽然有一些疯人正在煽动现在就要使用原子武器。这如果不是出于道义上的考虑，那就显然是常识上的考虑、谨慎以及恐怕使用原子武器可能造成不可挽救的后果的这种心理，在约束着那些想进行危险的冒险的人们，使他们不敢采取这种步骤。
    第二次世界大战已经提供了例子，说明某些道义上、政治上以及其他——我愿意说——生意上的考虑甚至使那些在法律上不受海牙公约约束的人们也没有对敌人使用毒气。
    为什么现在讨论禁止原子武器的时候把这一切都忘掉了呢？为什么现在大会要宣布禁止原子武器并建立国际监督以执行它的崇高职责的时候，却有人藉口大会这种决定可能被某些轻举妄动的政府利用来达到不义的目的，而提出这样强烈的反对呢？这种藉口是毫无根据的。
    英国代表昨天企图把苏联代表团的计划说成也是分阶段的计划，但是他的企图完全落空了。他列举了三个这样的阶段。劳埃德之所以反对这个计划就是因为它规定了某种阶段。那末，他为什么又同意三国提案中所提出的计划的那些阶段呢？这是很难用一般人所接受的逻辑法则来解释的。但是问题在于：我们的计划并没有规定任何阶段。如果考虑到下面这个事实，就不难了解这一点。这个事实是：分阶段制的实质并不是从一个阶段转入另一个阶段。如果是从一个阶段转入另一个阶段，这倒是极为自然的，因为我们不可能同时立刻做好几件工作。问题是在于：分阶段制之所以不能接受，是因为它规定了从一个阶段转入另一个阶段要取决于许多先决条件，这些先决条件使负责这件工作的机构大有随便行动的余地。
    这样，依照艾奇逊—巴鲁区—李连塞尔计划，在禁止原子武器方面，从管制原料阶段转入管制原子武器的生产的阶段是取决于若干条件的。估计这些条件是否成熟，完全是领导机构的职权范围以内的事。因此，依照巴鲁区计划，从一个阶段转入另一个阶段并不是自然无阻地从一个状态转入另一个状态，或者从一个行动转入另一个行动，而是要由负责这件工作的人们随意决定怎样做。
    如果分阶段的意义仅仅在于依照一件工作的物质方面所决定的必要顺序来完成这一件工作，这样来谈分阶段就是荒谬可笑的。例如，照劳埃德先生昨天的论调说来，人们可以说，早餐也有若干阶段，并且把这种阶段数一数，可以从布置餐桌数起一直到吃最后一道菜。
    我们认为，上述种种考虑都无可置疑地证明了不仅苏联方面和美国、英国、法国方面对于备忘录所说的达到共同目的的方法有着分歧，而且所谓“共同目的”也绝不是共同的和一致的。必须清楚了解已经发生的局势。为了要使这些“共同目的”成为真正共同的和真正一致的，还要做更多工作，要做很多很多工作。
    我们没有丧失希望，在我们进一步不屈不挠地和耐心地进行工作的过程中，是能够达到这一点的。
    为了辩明我们所提出的要求大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立国际监督的这个建议，我们曾经指出过，大会这种决定将有特殊的道德意义与政治意义。现在我们还必须强调这一点。大会的这种决定不会像某些人所想的那样是一张废纸，也不会是空话或骗人的手段。它之所以不会是废纸、空话或骗人的手段，是因为它符合亿万人民的内心愿望，在客观上能够、必须而且也一定有助于消除或者至少是缓和国际的紧张局势，它将有助于和平的事业，打击战争贩子和战争冒险的政策。
    美英法在裁军问题上的无理主张，是要联合国蹈国联的覆辙
    美、英、法三国政府和苏联政府之间的第二个分歧，是在裁减军备和武装部队的问题上。苏联建议的实质是：美国、英国、法国、中国和苏联五大国在一年内应把它们的全部武装部队和军备裁减三分之一。这个建议遭到了上述三国的反对。然而，应该说，在这一点上，它们提出的反对理由也是一点不能令我们满意的。的确，他们说，假如只是裁减军备，而别人不知道各大国正在裁减什么军备和打算裁减到什么水平，那末，这种裁减军备就不能说是有利于和平的。至于水平问题，我们已经相当详细地谈过了。我们可以简单地追述一下这件事最基本的要点。至今为止，提出关于水平的建议的人还不能对决定水平的原则说出什么合理的主张来。艾奇逊先生上一次曾经想这样做，然而我上次已经解释过，他的发言是一点也不能令人满意的。艾奇逊先生当时以国家领土的大小和人口的多少为基础，认为应该以这两点作为决定各国水平的准绳。一个国家的领土愈大，人口愈多，它所拥有的军备和武装部队也就愈多。然而，艾奇逊先生又说，必须定出某种限制，某种最高的限度，使水平不能超过这个最高限度。这就等于说，如果采纳了艾奇逊先生所提出的关于准绳的原则，又采纳了美国代表上次所谈到的水平，那末，军备数量和武装部队的数量就既不和国土大小相称，也不和人口相称了。那末，人们当然免不了要问：这个所谓水平到底还有什么意义呢？而且，如果从这个所谓水平出发，按照法、英、美三国代表在巴黎四国外长助理会议上所明确表示的那样做，这整个问题的最后结果就不会促成裁减军备，反而会促成扩张军备了。这样，人们当然免不了要问，如果最后不会裁减军备，这个水平和整个关于所谓裁减军备的措施到底又有什么价值呢？
    英国代表所提出的第二个问题是说，必须知道每一个国家的武装部队和军备的数量。我们也很充分地解释了这个问题。我们曾经指出：假如苏联所建议的裁减军备办法获得通过，那么关于武装部队和军备的一切数字就可以马上在会议桌上公开。这一点从苏联修正案的第七段里也可以很清楚地看到。那一段说：在联合国大会通过了禁止原子武器并裁减军备和武装部队的规定之后，无论如何不得晚于一个月，一切国家必须向国际管制机构提出完备的报告，说明在上述规定通过之时它们的武装部队和各类军备（包括原子武器在内）的详细情况。
    如果美国、英国和法国政府真是非常想知道关于苏联军备和武装部队的精确情报，这里就有一个最简捷便当的办法。那样，劳埃德先生以及劳埃德先生在发言中一并代表的其他两个国家的代表，就再也无须引用连他们自己也承认并不十分精确（或者，照我说，一点也不精确）的情报了。
    既然这样，他们还有什么理由反对苏联关于五大国裁减军备和武装部队三分之一的建议呢？没有了。也许他们还能说，这样裁减军备不会造成“均势”，而会让所谓苏联的军事优势不动分毫。但是，如果连劳埃德自己也承认，他所引用的关于苏联军备和武装部队的数字是不精确的，那末，他怎能谈什么苏联的军事优势呢？谁都知道，必须先有了关于军备和武装部队的详细材料，才能决定某一个国家是否有军事优势；如果没有这样的材料，就不可能估计任何国家的军事力量的。
    根据美、英、法三国代表的发言，我们可以很清楚地知道：他们在这个问题上的立场，就是以所谓均势学说为基础的。但是，这个学说从来不曾对和平事业有过什么贡献。尤其糟糕的是，所谓“均势”其实从来没有过实现的可能。例如，大家都知道，一九二一—二二年关于限制海军问题的华盛顿会议也规定了远东的均势，可是后来就没有能够实现，这件事成了要想取得均势和造成稳定形势而实际上却造成绝对不稳定的情况最好的例子。事实上，华盛顿协定不但没有保证远东的“均势”，反而巩固了日本在满洲南部的独占，使日本得到了战争发生时重要的战略保证，而日本在第二次世界大战中也的确利用了这个保证，用苏联政府元首斯大林生动的话来说，是把战后整个和平体系根本打乱了。
    这就使我们想起了一个英国政治领袖的问题，一个可以说是相当机智的问题。他问道：像英国这种海军国的需要，怎能和苏联那种大陆国的需要均衡呢？他又问道：步兵师怎能和原子弹或重轰炸机队比较呢，喷气式飞机怎能和普通螺旋桨推进的飞机比较呢，现代的潜水艇又怎能和战前的潜水艇比较呢？
    然而，西方不管过去的一切历史教训，不管还是不久以前的一切事实，不管希特勒德国、军国主义日本和法西斯意大利所发动的第二次世界大战的教训，另一方面却必恭必敬地记住国际联盟有损和平事业的行为，它们现在又企图使联合国组织走上以所谓“均势”来巩固和平的道路，而这条道路的恶果是大家已经知道了的。
    苏联不会走这条路。苏联要求联合国不要走这条路，如果它不打算重蹈国际联盟的覆辙，不打算重复过去悲惨的回忆的话。
    苏联对世界裁军会议提出明确办法，美英法则根本不想召开
    备忘录指出，显然大家都同意召开世界各国裁减军备会议，但是在这个问题上，对于召集会议的方法和时间存在着基本的分歧。不幸的是：存在着这种分歧是事实。但是分歧远不止是方法和时间的问题。
    苏联认真对待召开世界会议这件事，因此建议大会用完全清楚和毫不含糊的话通过下述决定：
    召开这种会议的方法：由大会决定向一切国家——包括联合国会员国和目前还不是联合国会员国的国家——的政府提出建议。
    时间：不得迟于一九五二年六月一日。
    世界会议的准备：建议安全理事会在三个月以内准备和提出实际可行的建议，以实施大会整个决议（我们正在讨论这个决议的草稿）中有关召开世界会议的部分。
    现在看来已经很清楚，每一个真心赞成世界会议的人都应该毫无保留地拥护这些建议。但是，美、英、法三国政府却提出不同的方法。他们仅仅限于建议大会宣布这种会议应该召开，甚至不规定召开这种会议的大概日期。他们仅仅限于表示会议召开的时间应该在十二国委员会的工作达到这个阶段的时候，这时，委员会认为它的计划的一部分已经准备好了可以提交给各国政府，因此可以召开会议了。这样，在这种情况下，整个问题就成了与任何实际可行的办法毫无关系的空洞的希望，也就没有多大意义了。
    把这两个建议比较一下，就十分清楚地看出两者之间的全部分歧。而且人们可以毫不怀疑地说：三国政府事实上一点也不想召开世界裁减军备会议，也不想在最短时间内真正裁减军备和武装部队。但是，这正是和平的利益，一切爱好和平的各国人民的利益所要求的。
    各国人民要求联合国采取积极
    措施结束美英法的扩军运动
    我已经谈过在苏联和三国之间引起分歧的那一些最重要的问题，谈得够详细了。遗憾的是：这种谈论比我所希望的还要详细。我这样作完全是想说明这些分歧是多么重要。这种分歧是由于苏联和美、英、法三国在某一特定问题上，也就是说在禁止原子武器、建立国际监督并裁减军备与武装部队这个问题上的政策所决定的。
    消除这些分歧对于改善国际关系的紧张状态这个重要问题，对于改善国际关系的问题，是有重大意义的。
    在小组委员会中，我们已经达成了某些重要的决定。这里有人说这是次要的决定，备忘录中也提到这是次要的决定，事实上也是次要的决定。但是即使这样，它却有着重要的意义。在消除我们之间的分歧方面每向前迈进一步，纵使目前是在次要的问题上，都会给我们一种希望：下一步就可以消除在较重要的问题上的意见分歧了。我们正在为此而奋斗，我们要这样，我们正在为这一点而努力。
    在小组委员会中达成了某些重要的决定，特别是关于把原子能委员会和常规军备委员会合并的决定，关于联合委员会的成份、委员人数以及工作程序的决定。表决问题和“否决权”的问题也获得了澄清。在这一切问题上都已经获得协议。我相信在我右边的邻座可以证实这一点。
    几乎无须强调这一切对和平事业是多么重要，对各国人民的福利是多么重要。各国人民正在要求联合国组织采取积极的决定性措施，以便结束疯狂的扩张军备运动，这种扩张军备运动对那些走这条路的国家的压力越来越大，使得大量的资源和精力都用在准备新的世界战争上面，而这些资源与精力本来可以用来减轻大西洋阵营中各国因扩张军备运动而遭受的痛苦，并改善被军事预算压得喘不过气来的人民的经济状况。
    联合国组织面临着巨大的任务：无条件禁止原子武器，裁减军备和武装部队，并建立严格的国际监督。为了加强和平，为了各国爱好和平的人民的利益，我们必须继续进行这一工作，朝着这个方向努力，并利用一切机会来完成上述任务。（新华社据塔斯社巴黎十三日电）
