    Jiangxi Pingxiang County Cultural and Educational Organs
    Should Lead Primary School Teachers in Ideological Remolding Studies
    Editor: Using criticism and self-criticism methods to conduct self-education and self-remolding is also urgently needed for us primary school teachers.
    Currently, there are many incorrect ideas among our primary school teachers: Some teachers believe that primary school teachers have no future, and therefore do not focus on their work, always wanting to find opportunities to transfer to other jobs. For example, Wen Zhenbin, a teacher at the Meizhao District Primary School in Pingxiang County, left his job mid-semester without the approval of his superiors and went to work at the Hengyang Railway Administration. Some teachers are lax in their work, believing that primary school teachers' salaries are low, and it doesn't matter whether they work hard or not. It should be admitted that it is a fact that primary school teachers' salaries are low. The People's Government is very concerned about this issue. As the country's economic situation improves, this problem will be gradually resolved. However, if the political awareness of primary school teachers is not gradually improved, how can primary education be consolidated and developed? I hope that the cultural and educational leading organs of Pingxiang County will quickly lead and organize primary school teachers to conduct ideological remolding studies.

    江西萍乡县文教机关
    应领导小学教师进行思想改造学习
    编辑同志：用批评和自我批评的方法进行自我教育和自我改造，对我们小学教师来说也是迫切需要的。
    目前，在我们小学教师中有许多不正确的思想：有些教师认为小学教师是没有前途的，因而不安心工作，总想找转业的机会。如萍乡县美昭区小学教师文振彬没有经过上级批准，就在本学期中途离职，考入衡阳铁路管理局工作。有些教师工作松懈，认为小学教师的待遇低，干不干也没有什么关系。应当承认，小学校教师待遇低是事实。人民政府对于这一问题是十分关怀的。随着国家经济情况的好转，这个问题将会逐步得到解决的。但是，如果小学教师的政治觉悟不逐步提高，那末，初等教育又如何能够巩固和发展呢？我希望萍乡县的文教领导机关迅速领导和组织小学教师进行思想改造的学习。
