    80% of the Children of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers in Chahar South Enrolled in School
    In their work of providing preferential treatment, cadres and teachers in various counties of the Chahar South Special District, Chahar Province, have included the task of ensuring that the children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers attend school in their patriotic pledges. The general public also attaches great importance to this work. To date, 10,069 children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers have been enrolled in schools throughout the Special District, accounting for slightly less than 80% of the total number of school-age children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In the Ganquan Central School District of the seventh district of Huailai County, there are 94 school-age children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in eight villages. Only 41 of them were enrolled last semester, but now all of them are enrolled. Before the "August 1st" Army Day, the Yuxian County Cultural Supply Cooperative distributed 1,247 textbooks free of charge to the children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the county who were facing difficulties. The Chicheng County Culture and Education Section consulted with the Civil Affairs Department and allocated 10,000 jin of millet from the preferential military grain supply as subsidies for books and stationery for the children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In order to ensure that all children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are enrolled, the teachers and students of the primary schools in Ganquan and other villages in Huailai County agreed with the village government that the schools would ensure that revolutionary martyrs' families lacking labor would have water and firewood (through extracurricular labor of teachers and students); village cadres would ensure that the work of substitute farming was well-led. Seeing that the children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the Northeast Jiang Primary School of Yuxian County lacked learning supplies, the teachers and students donated 110 large sheets of writing paper.
    Currently, the Chahar South Administrative Office is leading various counties to strive to get the out-of-school children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers back to school.

    察南烈军属子女百分之八十入学
    在优抚工作中，察哈尔省察南专区各县的干部、教师们都把如何使烈军属子女就学这一任务列入自己的爱国公约中。一般群众也很重视这一工作。到目前为止，全专区已有一万零六十九名烈军属的子女入了学，占烈军属子女中学龄儿童总数的百分之八十弱。怀来县第七区甘泉中心学区八个村，烈军属子女中的学龄儿童共九十四人，上学期只有四十一人入学，现已全部入学。蔚县文化供应社在“八一”节前曾免费发给全县较困难的烈军属的子女课本一千二百四十七册。赤城县文教科商请民政部门拨出优军粮一万斤小米，作为烈军属子女的书籍文具补助费。怀来县甘泉等村的小学校师生，为了保证烈军属子女全部入学，他们和村政府议定：学校保证供给缺乏劳动力的烈军属有水吃、有柴烧（师生课外劳动）；村干部保证把代耕工作领导好。蔚县东北江小学校师生，看到学校里烈军属同学缺乏学习用品，就捐募了学习纸一百一十大张。
    目前，察南专署正领导各县争取失学的烈军属子女继续就学。　蔡仁健　刘　康
