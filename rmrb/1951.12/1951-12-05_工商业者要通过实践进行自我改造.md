Industrial and Commercial Businessmen Must Remold Themselves Through Practice
Huang Yanpei

Chairman Mao instructed us in his opening address at the Third Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee: We must continue to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production and practice economy; we must educate and remold ourselves. At that time, the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was published, which is a good opportunity for everyone to educate and remold themselves. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's instructions, and we must earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought.

Learning must be combined with work practice to remold ourselves.

Generally, industrial and commercial entrepreneurs are studying, and their studies will affect their work. However, a few people still have some problems, which I would like to discuss here:

Under the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests as stipulated in the Common Program of the CPPCC, the People's Government will assist the development of private enterprises as long as they are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Only the pursuit of exorbitant profits is not allowed.

In the first half of 1950, the socio-economic situation was sluggish during the transition. The government launched effective financial and economic policies, accelerated the stabilization of prices and finance, and strived for the stabilization of the people's hearts. Next, the land reform work was launched. In the past ten months, the purchasing power of the rural areas has increased, and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has improved. The economic situation has gone from initial improvement to steady and high improvement. General daily necessities are sufficient for sale and are selling well, and some things are in short supply.

In this process, the thinking of entrepreneurs has undergone many changes, from great panic to no panic, and even from a little hope to great hope. Entrepreneurs are mostly sensitive. Some people imagined that certain daily necessities would be in great demand in the future and tried to perform the old tricks, such as privately raising prices, hoarding goods, and engaging in speculation. These were gradually and slightly discovered in big cities.

Of course, these are local and individual phenomena. Capitalists who have studied the various documents of the People's Government and new books and newspapers and whose thinking has already changed will not do it. But since there are facts happening like sprouts, we have to earnestly tell them these principles as soon as possible.

The principle is really very simple.

As a people of the People's Republic of China, under the People's Government, no matter which position you stand in, you should serve the people. If you serve the people, you are of course allowed to obtain the necessary supply for your own life. If you invest a sum of money in a certain industry or commerce, you are of course allowed to obtain a considerable profit under the New Democracy. These are all without problems, but you are absolutely not allowed to use any opportunity or any method to deceive or exploit people. The behaviors that were gradually and slightly discovered earlier, their purpose is only to seek exorbitant profits. It must be understood: if one person gets exorbitant profits here, many people will suffer harm there. Assuming that people don't have these things, and they can't get them even if they want to, and you raised the price to buy them, and you raised the price even higher, and further hoarded them, hid them, said I don't have them, so that people have to painfully suffer losses when they urgently need these things, and even painfully suffer losses, they still can't get them, isn't this deceiving people and exploiting people? The bullies and landlords were tried by the masses and ended up with a tragic end because they committed the crime of deceiving and exploiting people. Private enterprises are taken care of by the government under the New Democracy. As long as it is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as mentioned above, it is impossible to seek profit from deception and exploitation, benefiting oneself and harming others, under the People's Government.

We absolutely do not oppose industrialists and businessmen making profits, but we only hope that they do not seek illegal profits, do not seek exorbitant profits. This is absolutely dangerous, at least there are two major dangers that are likely to happen to them:

First, any industrial and commercial business, employees, and workers are all studying and their thinking is being transformed. If those behaviors are done, I guarantee that the employees and workers will expose the inside story one by one, how much was the price of a certain goods, where is a certain goods hoarded, then, the boss and manager will be in trouble.

Second, since liberation, young men and women have undergone new learning, and their thinking has been generally transformed. Recently, neighborhood education in some big cities has been developing rapidly, and women are all learning and are rapidly liberating. If the boss or manager does those behaviors, it will not immediately become the object of a family revolution, and they are likely to be severely criticized by their children and family members.

We admire those advanced and visionary entrepreneurs who recognized the truth of serving the people very early, who recognized the regularity of social development and class struggle very early, who integrated with employees and workers very early, and who opened up all the details of the factory and store very early. Here I would like to give a very obvious and correct example:

There is a large department store in Sichuan, with several factories attached, called "Baoyuantong," and there are branches in several places. As early as before 1940, these founders and organizers had already opened up their factory and store under the dark politics. Its core organization has long included employee representatives. If the system under the People's Government is compared, it is simply beyond the labor-capital consultation committee of private enterprises and close to the management committee of public enterprises (of course, not exactly the same). At that time, they showed me the organizational documents and humbly sought opinions. This group of entrepreneurs are truly worthy of being called advanced and visionary, and are truly worthy of our admiration. Today, there are naturally more such advanced and visionary entrepreneurs, needless to say.

Everyone is the master of the country, and everyone serves the people. The reason why these ideas are created is because there is a beautiful vision that powerfully attracts them. What is the vision? It is socialism. We have accepted Chairman Mao's instructions to move from New Democracy to Socialism. What is a socialist society like? If you want to read books, I will introduce two books that I have read. 1. "The New Life of the New Society," translated by Xu Jun, published by Xinhua Bookstore. 2. "The Continuously Improving Living Standards of the Soviet People," translated by Bi Shenfu, published by the 1950s Press. From these, you can very specifically and clearly understand the happiness of the Soviet people in socialist advanced countries. Perhaps everyone has read and seen these.

Learning must be combined with work practice. Each of us must combine Chairman Mao's instructions with our own work practice to remold ourselves. Industrial and commercial entrepreneurs, if you study like this, I dare to guarantee that you will absolutely not allow those exorbitant profit ideas to interfere with your minds.

### 工商业者要通过实践进行自我改造

    工商业者要通过实践进行自我改造
    黄炎培
    毛主席在人民政治协商会议全国委员会第三次会议开会词里指示我们：要继续加强抗美援朝，要增产节约；要自我教育，自我改造，就在那时，“毛泽东选集”发行了，这是每一个人教育自己，改造自己的好机会，我们要认真学习毛主席的指示，我们要认真学习毛泽东思想。
    学习必须和工作实践相结合来自我改造。
    一般工商企业家都在学习了，他们的学习都会影响他们的工作。但中间少数人还存在些问题，在这里愿说一说：
    人民政府在严肃执行政协共同纲领规定公私兼顾政策之下，对私营企业，只须于国计民生有利，没有不扶助它发展的。只不允许争取暴利。
    一九五○年上半年社会经济，在转变过程中，一度发现不景气情况，政府展开有效的财经政策，加速度从物价稳定，金融稳定，争取人心稳定，接下来土地改革工作展开了。最近十个月来农村购买力提高，城乡物资交流，经济情况早从初度的好转，稳步前进到高度的好转。一般日用品够销了，畅销了，有些东西供不应求了。
    在这一过程中，企业家的思想，起了不少演变，从大恐慌演变为不恐慌，更从稍有希望演变为大有希望。企业家大都是敏感的。中间有些人，想像到某些日用品今后会大大地供不应求，尝试地演出老的一套，如私抬价格，囤积居奇，投机取巧，这些渐渐地微微地发见在大都市。
    这些，当然是局部的个别的现象。凡学习过人民政府各种文件和新书新报而思想已在转变的资本家不会做出来的。但既有事实像萌芽般在发生，我们得恳切地把这些道理，趁早向他们说一下。
    道理实在简单得很。
    作为一个中华人民共和国的人民，在人民政府之下，不管你站在那一岗位，都应该为人民服务。你为人民服务，当然允许你取得自己所需求的一分生活必要的供给。你对某种工商业投下一笔资金，在新民主主义下，当然也允许你取得相当的利润。这些都是无问题的，只是绝对不许你利用某种机会，使用某种方法，去欺骗人，剥削人。前边说到渐渐地微微地发见那些行为，他们目的只是希图取得暴利。必须懂得：一个人在这里得到了暴利，同时就有许多人在那里受到了暴害。假定人家没有这些东西，要得也得不到，而你高抬了价格购到了，把价格更高抬起来了，进一步囤积起来了，藏起来了，说我没有，使人家急需这些东西时，不得不忍痛吃亏，甚至忍痛吃亏了，还得不到，这还不是欺骗人，剥削人，而是什么呢！恶霸、地主，受群众审判，落得一个悲惨的下场，就是犯了欺骗人剥削人的罪恶。私人企业在新民主主义下，政府对它是照顾的。只须于国计民生有利，上文说过的了，从欺骗上，剥削上图利，利己害人，在人民政府下，那些行为不行。
    我们绝对不反对工商业家图利，只希望他们勿图非法之利，勿图暴利。这是绝对危险的，至少先有两大危险，很可能发生在他们面前：
    第一、任何工商业、职员们、工人们都在学习了，思想都在改造了，那些行为干出来的话，我保证职员们工人们会把内幕一一揭发出来，某货是多少多少价格买进来的，某货囤藏在某处某处，到那时候，当老板的，当经理的，不得了。
    第二、解放以来，青年男女经过了新的学习，思想早已普遍改造，最近某些大都市里弄教育大踏步展开，妇女们都在学习，都在迅速解放，如果当老板的、当经理的，干出那些行为，就使一下子不致变成家庭革命对象，很可能遭受儿女们家人们严厉的批评。
    我们很钦佩那些先进的远见的企业家，他们很早认识了为人民服务的真理，他们很早认识了社会发展、阶级斗争的规律性，他们很早和职员们工人们打成一片，很早把厂店所有底子一切公开。在这里我愿举一个很显明很正确的例子：
    四川有一家很大的百货商业，附设若干工厂，叫做“宝元通”，若干地方都有分店。远在一九四○年以前，这几位创始者和组织者在黑暗政治之下，很早把他的厂店公开起来了。它的核心组织，很早就包括员工代表的，若把人民政府下制度比拟起来，简直是超过了私营企业的劳资协商委员会，而接近了公营企业的管理委员会（当然不完全一样的）。在那时候，他们曾把组织文件给我看。虚心地征求意见。这一群企业家真配称为先进的，远见的，真值得我们钦佩。到了今天，这一类先进的、远见的企业家自然更多，不用说了。
    人人是国家的主人翁，人人为人民服务，这些思想之所以造成，都为了有一幅美丽的远景，在那里强有力地吸引。是什么远景？是社会主义。我们接受了毛主席的指示，要从新民主主义前进到社会主义。社会主义的社会怎样的呢？愿读书的话，我就介绍我所读过的两本书。一、“新社会的新生活”，徐均译，新华书店出版。二、“不断提高的苏联人民生活水准”，毕慎夫译，五十年代社出版。从这些中间，可以很具体地很清楚地了解到社会主义先进国家苏联人民的幸福，这些也许大家读过看过的。
    学习必须和工作实践相结合。我们每一个人学习，须把毛主席的指示和自己的工作实践相结合来自我改造，工商企业家们，如果这样学习，我敢于保证绝对不会容许那些暴利思想，干扰到你们的脑海。
