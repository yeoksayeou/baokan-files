In the Changzhou City tax department of Southern Jiangsu, a collective corruption incident occurred because some personnel who had worked in Kuomintang agencies were not reformed, coupled with bureaucratic tendencies of leading cadres. This resulted in tax officials and illegal businessmen colluding to offer bribes and evade taxes for two years, escalating from small to large, and from secret to open. This incident was discovered by the leading authorities in April of this year, and some facts were immediately uncovered. In July, the People's Supervision Committee of the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office sent an inspection team. After more than two months of investigation, the entire case was clarified, revealing a total of 85 corrupt officials, involving a total of 243 million yuan in embezzled funds, 293 bribery-giving stores, and 1.054 billion yuan in evaded taxes, with the duration of corruption and bribery lasting for two years.

In order to handle this case cautiously, the People's Supervision Committee of the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office convened its fifth committee meeting. After detailed study, it made a decision on handling the collective corruption and malfeasance incident of tax cadres in Changzhou City. The decision pointed out that the incident of corruption and malfeasance by tax cadres and tax evasion by illegal businessmen in Changzhou City had lasted for nearly two years. The number of corrupt cadres had grown from four to 85, accounting for more than 37% of the city's tax cadres, including four section chiefs and heads, 79 tax officials, and two support staff members. The scope covered the Changzhou City Tax Bureau's secretariat, goods tax section, local tax section, direct tax section, inspection section, and its seven affiliated tax offices. Six people from the Changzhou Prefectural Tax Bureau were also involved in the case. They used main methods such as extortion and accepting bribes during audits, colluding with butchers to evade taxes and divide the tax money, altering payment slips and vouchers to embezzle public funds, and seeking excuses to borrow from merchants, embezzling a total of more than 243 million yuan. Among them, 58 directly colluded with illegal businessmen to solicit bribes, and 27 were corrupted by direct embezzlers and shared the spoils. Zhou Qian, the direct tax officer of the Shuanggui Lane Tax Office, was the most serious, embezzling more than 50 times in succession, amounting to more than 55 million yuan. Zhou Qian, Gu Borong, Zhang Jiasheng, and Shi Zhongxin (known by the masses as the "Four King Kongs of Corruption") instigated the formation of several small corruption groups, forming a serious incident of semi-open collective corruption and malfeasance.

A total of 293 industrial and commercial households in 55 industries were involved in bribery, including 15 trade associations that collectively offered bribes, and 11 representatives of the industrial and commercial sector of the Changzhou Municipal People's Congress also participated in bribery. After mobilizing confessions and conducting key spot checks on 27 businesses, it was discovered that they evaded business tax, temporary business tax, and stamp tax totaling 1.654 billion yuan by means of barter trade, setting up false accounts, and not registering purchases and sales.

This incident not only caused huge losses to the wealth of the state and the people, but also had a widespread and serious negative impact, especially politically. For example, some employees were dissatisfied with the government on this point. Some businessmen even thought that "as long as you have money, there is always a way to go." Tax cadres reacted by saying, "Corruption and malfeasance pay off." Some cadres said, "It's strange that the leadership doesn't know about such a serious corruption incident." This shows that this collective corruption and malfeasance incident has seriously damaged the political prestige of the People's Government, blurred the masses' understanding of the People's Government, greatly affected the mobilization of the masses and the implementation of various tasks in Changzhou City, and damaged the relationship between the People's Government and the people.

The reasons for this case are: first, the composition of tax cadres in Changzhou City is relatively complex. A group of people headed by Zhou Qian, who had previously served in Kuomintang agencies, were of poor character, habitually corrupt, and after liberation, they did not seek reform, were selfish and disregarded the law, and continued to engage in corruption and malfeasance, damaging the wealth of the state. Second, illegal businessmen used their old tricks of bribery and tax evasion to lure and corrupt tax cadres with weak will. Third, the leadership of the Changzhou City Tax Bureau suffered from serious paralysis, dereliction of duty, and bureaucracy. The system was not strict, there was a lack of supervision, and political education and ideological reform of tax personnel were neglected. They were satisfied with the familiarity with business and the pretense of activity of a few bad elements, and therefore blindly trusted them and relaxed leadership. They did not adopt a correct attitude towards the correct reactions of the masses and did not promptly check and handle the problems, allowing illegal elements to take advantage of the loopholes. In addition, the lifestyle of individual leading cadres was not serious enough, accepting invitations from illegal elements to eat and drink, and borrowing money and exchanging gifts with illegal elements, which also promoted the rise of evil tendencies and influenced and promoted the development of this incident.

The decision stated that in order to uphold the law, educate cadres and the people, and protect state property, a principle of separate treatment should be adopted based on the severity of the relevant crimes and the degree of confession and repentance during the inspection. In addition to instructing the Changzhou Municipal People's Government to handle illegal businessmen and recover the embezzled funds of corrupt cadres, the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office was requested to approve the following punishments for the personnel involved in the case:

(1) Zhou Qian, Gu Borong, and Zhang Jiasheng, direct tax officers of the Changzhou City Tax Bureau's tax office, and Shi Zhongxin, an officer of the city Tax Bureau's direct tax section, were all chief culprits of corruption. They had consistently extorted and blackmailed, and shielded illegal businessmen from tax evasion. They had the most number of instances of corruption and the largest amount of embezzled funds. During the inspection process, they were still unrepentant, especially Zhou Qian, who was cunning and denied everything, and insisted on their mistakes. Therefore, they were all given the punishment of dismissal from their posts and transferred to the judicial authorities for strict handling according to law.

(2) Wang Chunming, deputy section chief of the city Tax Bureau's direct tax section, officers Zhang Jin'yi, Sun Boyuan, Gao Qingshou, etc., were of poor character and colluded with illegal businessmen to engage in malfeasance. The amount of direct embezzlement was more than 9 million yuan each. They were able to confess during the inspection and had automatically reported the corruption of others. Officers Zhu Yun, Lu Tuo, Lang Jinsui, Yu Zhenliang, and Su Shizheng, etc., embezzled a total of more than 4.5 million yuan. After many times of education and enlightenment during the inspection, their confessions were not thorough enough, and some even insisted on their mistakes and obstructed others from confessing. Dai Yuguang, deputy section chief of the city Tax Bureau's goods tax section, and Zhuang Nuo, deputy section chief of the local tax section, did not stop the corrupt behavior when they discovered it, but instead followed them in embezzling and distributing the spoils, each receiving more than 1 million yuan. Zhuang Nuo also helped individual corrupt elements escape. Officer Zhou Qi embezzled 340,000 yuan, refused to confess himself, and sabotaged the confessions of others. Xu Canwen, deputy director of the Huaide Bridge Tax Office, was transferred to the city's suburban area as a township head, but still did not repent and continued to commit the mistakes of corruption and degeneration. Huang Xiuzhou, director of the Shuanggui Lane Tax Office, was a cadre who had participated in the revolution for a long time. Due to the growth of his capitalist ideology, he turned a blind eye to the corrupt behavior of Zhou Qian and others, and borrowed money, ate and drank, and accepted gifts from illegal businessmen, colluding with them. Afterwards, he also concealed and denied everything, and did not humbly examine himself. Therefore, all of the above fourteen people were given the punishment of dismissal from their posts.

(3) Officers Yao Yongnian, Lu Qiaochang, Shao Henian, Liu Hanmin, Pan Jie, Wang Shuming, etc., all directly colluded with businessmen to embezzle more than 2 million yuan, and their mistakes were also very serious. However, because they were able to accept education during the inspection and gradually recognized their mistakes, they were all given the punishment of recording two major demerits.

Officers Wu Minze, Sun Xinxia, Jiang Zhidong, Zhao Zhengjun, Tao Changlin, Yan Hongyuan, Wang Shouhuai, etc. embezzled more than 1.2 million yuan each, and their self-criticisms were better. Officers Tang Keyan, Zhang Chongyou, Geng Fusheng, Yu Jixiao, etc. embezzled more than 780,000 yuan each, and their confession spirit was poor, and they needed to continue to make deep self-criticisms. All of the above eleven people were given the punishment of recording one major demerit.

(4) Officers Zhu Qingchang, Liu Hongfa, Sun Dingzhi, etc. embezzled more than 500,000 yuan each. Although they made self-criticisms, their understanding of their mistakes was insufficient, and they were all given the punishment of recording a demerit.

(5) Officer Li Zhengqing embezzled 970,000 yuan, but he was able to seriously examine himself, sincerely confess his mistakes, and actively improve his work. Therefore, he was given a lighter punishment and given a warning. Officers Ma Rongkun and Shi Huinan embezzled less than 300,000 yuan each, but their performance was not frank enough, so they were each given a warning.

(6) Officer Zhao Guichan and 44 others were mostly indirectly involved in dividing the spoils, and the amount of embezzlement was relatively small. After education, they were all able to humbly and thoroughly examine themselves, face up to and actively correct their mistakes, and were all exempted from punishment.

(7) Wang Shihua, director of the City Tax Bureau, since taking office in June 1950, his main mistake was serious paralysis, dereliction of duty, irresponsible bureaucracy, failure to go deep into his work, undemocratic leadership style, neglect of ideological leadership of tax cadres, and tax cadres had repeatedly reflected on corruption and malfeasance, but Wang turned a deaf ear to it and failed to seriously investigate and deal with it. Although he was able to face up to his mistakes afterwards and made a relatively deep self-criticism, he should bear the main responsibility for the continued development of this serious incident and was given the punishment of dismissal from his post.

(8) He Yifeng, the former director of the City Tax Bureau, his main mistake was complacency and a one-sided business viewpoint, blindly trusting Zhou Qian and others, relaxing leadership. He failed to value the opinions of the masses and promptly correct the illegal behavior of tax cadres, showing a weak mass concept. At the same time, his life was not serious enough, and he should bear the main responsibility for the occurrence of the incident. He made a self-criticism afterwards and recognized his mistakes, and was given the punishment of recording one major demerit.

Chen Zhendong, the former deputy director of the City Tax Bureau, during his four months in office, was mainly ideologically paralyzed and emotional. He was not serious enough in his life, accepting invitations to drink from individual corrupt elements, and exchanging gifts with each other, which affected the willful corruption of some bad elements. Now, in addition to ordering him to continue to deeply examine himself and correct his mistakes, he was given a warning.

(9) Yu Yichao, the former deputy director of the Changzhou Prefectural Tax Bureau, his serious mistake was seeking personal gain, disregarding national discipline and leadership prestige, knowing the law and violating the law, entrusting the director of the tax office, Huang Xiuzhou, through his younger brother to transfer "opium" of 4 liang to corrupt elements for sale, and borrowing money from corrupt elements twice and accepting corrupt elements' invitations to eat and drink, which fueled the corruption of some tax personnel. However, his self-criticism afterwards was still deep, and it was decided to give him the punishment of recording three major demerits.

(10) The responsibility of the Changzhou Municipal People's Government's leadership was mainly that it lacked inspection, supervision, and concrete assistance to the work of the Tax Bureau on weekdays. After the incident occurred, its understanding was insufficient, and it neither handled it seriously nor promptly requested instructions and reports from the Southern Jiangsu leadership organs, which was extremely inappropriate. Now, Mayor Zhuge Shen has made a relatively deep self-criticism and is actively improving the work of the Municipal Tax Bureau. Therefore, he is exempted from punishment.

    苏南查办常州税务局集体贪污舞弊事件
    首犯周谦等已被撤职送人民法院依法惩处
    逃漏巨额税款的不法商人也已送政府处理
    苏南区常州市税务部门中因为有一部分曾在国民党机关工作的人员没有得到改造，加上领导干部的官僚主义，造成了两年来税务干部和不法商人共同勾结行贿逃税，并由小而大、由秘密而公开的集体贪污的事件。这一事件在今年四月份被领导机关发觉，当即查出部分事实。七月，苏南人民行政公署人民监察委员会派出检查团，经过两个多月的检查，案情全部弄清，计查出贪污干部八十五人。贪污款额二亿四千三百余万元，行贿商店有二百九十三家，逃税十亿五千四百多万元，贪污行贿时间连续达二年。
    为了慎重地处理这个案件，苏南人民行政公署人民监察委员会特召开了第五次委员会议，经过详细研究，作出关于处理常州市税务干部集体贪污舞弊事件的决定。决定指出：常州市税务干部贪污舞弊和不法商人行贿逃税事件，为时已近二年。贪污的干部从四人发展到八十五人，占全市税务干部的百分之三十七强；其中股长、所长四人，税务员七十九人，勤杂人员二人。其范围遍及常州市税务局秘书室、货物税股、地方税股、直接税股、检查股和所属七个税务所，常州专署税务局也有六人是这一案件的有关人员。他们采用了查账时敲诈受贿、勾结屠商逃税朋分税款、涂改缴款书凭证贪污中饱、找寻藉口向商人索借等主要方法，共计贪污人民币二亿四千三百多万元。其中，直接和不法商人勾结索贿的五十八人，受直接贪污分子腐蚀分肥的二十七人；内以双桂坊税务所直接税主办员周谦为最严重，竟连续贪污五十多次，贪污数额五千五百多万元；并以周谦、顾伯榕、张家声、石仲信四人（群众号称“贪污四大金刚”）主使结成若干贪污小集团，形成半公开的集体贪污舞弊的严重事件。
    行贿的工商业户共有五十五个行业，二百九十三家；其中有十五个同业公会集体行贿，并有该市各界人民代表会议工商界代表十一人参加行贿。经动员坦白并重点抽查了二十七家商号，发现他们采取以物易物、设置假账、进销货不登账等方法逃漏营业税、临商税、印花税款达十六亿五千四百多万元。
    这一事件不仅使国家和人民的财富受到巨大损失，特别是在政治上造成普遍的严重的坏影响。如某些职工就在这一点上不满意政府。部分商人甚至以为“只要有钱，就有路可走”。税务干部反应：
    “贪污舞弊吃得开。”有的干部说：“这种严重贪污事件，领导方面不知道，很奇怪。”这说明这一集体贪污舞弊事件，已严重地破坏了人民政府的政治威信，模糊了群众对人民政府的认识，极大地影响了常州市群众的发动和各项工作的贯彻，损害了人民政府和人民群众的联系。
    这一案发生的原因：一是由于常州市税务干部成员比较复杂，以周谦为首的一部曾在国民党机关任职的人员，品质恶劣，贪污成性，解放后不求改造，自私自利，目无法纪，继续贪污舞弊，损害国家的财富。其次是不法商人逞其行贿逃税故技，引诱、腐蚀意志薄弱的税务干部。再次是由于常州市税务局的领导方面存在着严重的麻痹失职不负责任的官僚主义，制度不严，缺乏检查，忽视对税务人员的政治教育和思想改造，满足于少数坏分子的熟悉业务和伪装积极，因而盲目信任，放松领导；并对群众的正确反应没有采取正确态度，及时检查处理，致使不法分子有隙可乘。加之个别领导干部生活作风不够严肃，接受不法分子的邀请吃喝，并向不法分子借钱、互相送礼，也促使邪气上升，影响和助长了这一事件的发展。
    决定称：为严肃法纪，教育干部和人民群众，保护国家财富，现根据有关案犯罪行的轻重和在检查中坦白改悔程度，采取分别处理的原则；除责成常州市人民政府处理不法商人及追缴贪污干部的贪污款项外，对本案有关的工作人员，报请苏南人民行政公署批准决定分别给予如下处分：
    （一）常州市税务局税务所直接税主办员周谦、顾伯榕、张家声，市税务局直接税股办事员石仲信，都是贪污主犯。一贯敲诈勒索，包庇不法商人逃税；贪污的次数最多，贪污数额最大；在检查过程中，他们仍执迷不悟，尤其是周谦，狡猾抵赖，坚持错误；因此，各予以撤职处分，并移送司法机关依法严办。
    （二）市税务局直接税股副股长王春明、办事员张晋翼、孙博渊、高庆寿等，品质恶劣，和不法商人勾结舞弊，直接贪污数额都在九百万元以上。在检查中还能坦白，并曾自动检举别人的贪污行为。办事员朱云、陆拓、郎金绥、虞振良、苏石正等，贪污总额都在四百五十万元以上；在检查中经过多次教育启发，坦白还不彻底，甚至有的还坚持错误，阻挠别人坦白。市税务局货物税股副股长戴玉光、地方税股副股长庄诺，发觉贪污行为不加制止，反而随同贪污分赃，各得款一百数十万元，庄诺并帮助个别贪污分子逃跑。办事员周琪贪污三十四万元，自己不肯坦白，并破坏别人的坦白；怀德桥税务所副所长徐灿文，现调任该市郊区任乡长后，还不悔悟，继续犯贪污腐化错误；双桂坊税务所所长黄秀洲，是参加革命较久的干部，由于其资本主义思想的滋长，对周谦等贪污行为熟视无睹，并向周谦等借款、吃喝、接受不法商人礼物，同流合污；事后还掩饰抵赖，不虚心检讨。因此对以上十四人都给以撤职处分。
    （三）办事员姚永年、陆洽常、邵鹤年、刘汉民、潘杰、王树明等，都直接和商人勾结贪污在二百万元以上，错误也很严重；但因他们在检查中还能接受教育，逐渐认识自己错误，故都给以记大过二次处分。
    办事员吴民泽、孙心侠、蒋之栋、赵正军、陶长林、严洪元、王寿槐等贪污都在一百二十万元以上，检讨较好。办事员唐克颜、张崇友、耿福生、虞济孝等贪污都在七十八万元以上，坦白精神差，须继续作深刻检讨。对上述十一人都给以记大过一次处分。
    （四）办事员朱庆昌、刘洪法、孙定之等贪污都在五十万元以上，虽作了检讨，但认识错误不够，都给以记过处分。
    （五）办事员李正清，贪污九十七万元，但能认真检讨，诚恳坦白错误，积极改进工作，故从轻议处，给以警告处分。办事员马荣坤、史惠南二人贪污都不足三十万元，但表现不够坦白，故各给以警告处分。
    （六）办事员赵桂蟾等四十四人大部是间接分肥，且贪污数字较少，经教育后，都能虚心彻底检讨，正视并积极改正错误，都免予处分。
    （七）市税务局局长王士华，自一九五○年六月任职以来，其主要错误是严重的麻痹失职，不负责任的官僚主义，工作不深入，领导作风不够民主，忽视了对税务干部的思想领导，干部群众多次反映税务干部有贪污舞弊行为，而王竟置若罔闻，未能严肃检查处理，事后虽能正视错误，作了比较深刻的检讨，但应负这一严重事件继续发展的主要责任，予以撤职处分。
    （八）市税务局前任局长贺一峰，其主要错误是麻痹自满，片面的业务观点，对周谦等盲目信任，放松领导。并未能重视群众的意见，及时纠正税务干部的违法行为，表现群众观念薄弱，同时生活上也不够严肃，应负事件发生的主要责任，事后作了检讨，认识了错误，予以记大过一次处分。
    市税务局前任副局长陈振东，在任职四个月期间，主要是思想麻痹，感情用事，表现在生活上不够严肃，接受个别贪污分子邀请吃酒，互送礼物，影响某些坏分子的恣意贪污；现除责令其继续深刻检查，改正错误外，予以警告处分。
    （九）常州专署税务局前任副局长余一超，其严重的错误是贪图个人利益，不顾国家纪律和领导威信，知法犯法，为其胞弟委托税务所所长黄秀洲转托贪污分子出售“鸦片”四两，并两次向贪污分子借钱，接受贪污分子请客吃喝，助长了某些税务人员的贪污气焰。惟事后检讨还深刻，决定给予记大过三次的处分。
    （十）常州市人民政府领导方面的责任，主要是平时对税务局的工作缺乏检查督促和具体帮助，事件发生后，认识不足，既未能严肃处理，又未及时向苏南领导机关请示报告，这是极不应该的。现市长诸葛慎已作了较深刻的检讨，并积极地改善市税局的工作，故免予议处。
