Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The summation of the "1951 Weaving Method" is a model of combining scientific theory with practical experience in improving China's industrial technology. This summation work points out the correct direction for our country's future work of summarizing and promoting advanced experience.

Before the National Weaving Method Conference held in November this year, the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union of China and the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government had successively received summaries of weaving methods from Qingdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, Northeast, Northwest, and Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory, Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory, and Shanxi Jinhua Yarn Factory. These summaries themselves are the products of concentrating the excellent experience of the masses by using the Kovalev method. For example, the automatic loom working method summarized in Qingdao is a conclusion drawn after measuring and comparing the operational advantages of seven workers including Jiang Aizhi, Wei Xiuying, and Sun Xiuzhen. These summaries made it possible for the National Weaving Method Conference to summarize the advanced experience of weaving workers across the country. The automatic loom working method in the 1951 Weaving Method is based on the Qingdao summary, plus Tianjin weaving model worker Pang Qingfu's understanding of the machine performance, and a comprehensive study of the individual operational advantages of weaving model workers in Tianjin, Northeast, Shanghai and other places. The ordinary loom working method is based on the combination of the operating methods of Jiang Shuying of Tianjin and Wang Jiande of Qingdao, plus a comprehensive study of the advantages of Wang Deshan of Tianjin, Wang Jiaxiang of Qingdao, and weaving model workers in Shanghai. Therefore, the 1951 Weaving Method is superior and more mature than the weaving methods of any region and the operating experience of individual weaving model workers.

The summary work of the 1951 Weaving Method shows that summarizing advanced experience must combine theory with practice, and manual labor with mental labor. This National Weaving Method Conference brought together more than 70 people, including national model weaving workers, engineers, technicians, and experts, and spent 16 days in a yarn factory in Tianjin conducting on-site performances, measurements, analysis, comparisons, research and other summary work. In the process of summarizing, due to the mastery of scientific measurement, many problems that were difficult to solve on the conference table relying solely on "theory" in the past have now been quickly resolved. For example, before the ordinary loom group conducted measurements, they believed that the working methods of Jiang Shuying of Tianjin and Wang Jiande of Qingdao were better, but they disagreed on which one was better. Later, the measurement results showed that Jiang's method involved 6% less walking than Wang's method; if Jiang Shuying used Wang Jiande's movements, the stop rate could be reduced by 0.37% compared to Wang Jiande; the ratio of active shuttle change to passive shuttle change was 4:1 for Jiang's method and 2:1 for Wang's method. This means that Jiang's method involves less walking, more initiative, and higher output than Wang's method. In this way, the question of which of the two working methods is more superior was resolved. Also, due to the mastery of scientific measurement, the advantages of various working methods can be fully preserved. Therefore, the 1951 Weaving Method summarized this time has become a weaving method that can be universally adopted nationwide, with initiative in work (regular patrolling or shuttle changes), high quality, material saving, and no increase in labor intensity.

The summary work of the 1951 Weaving Method also shows that technology and politics must be closely integrated. In the early stages of the conference, some representatives were not humble enough, and came to the meeting with the idea of "winning battles" and "competing". Later, representatives from various regions held group meetings separately, conducted self-criticism, and formulated patriotic covenants, promising to learn from each other with humility. This created an atmosphere of mutual learning at the conference. For example, engineers and workers from Qingdao learned the actions of dismantling broken cloth from Shanghai workers, and Shanghai workers learned the patrol rules from Qingdao. This created a solid ideological foundation for concentrating the operational advantages of weaving workers across the country, and ensured the smooth progress of the summary work. At the same time, the weaving worker representatives who attended the meeting gained rich results in the summary process. Hua Yanying, a weaving worker from the State-owned Shanghai Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, said after visiting and learning the 1951 Weaving Method: "In Shanghai, I used to look after twelve automatic looms, and I was so busy that I couldn't take care of them well and produced substandard cloth. After arriving in Tianjin, I have learned the new working method in just four days. Because the patrol has become regular, the ability to look after the machines has also improved. Now I can look after thirty-two looms without being flustered, and not a single piece of substandard cloth has been produced."

    “一九五一织布工作法”的总结工作
    指出了工业技术理论和实际经验相结合的正确方向
    【新华社二日讯】一九五一织布工作法的总结工作是在提高我国工业技术方面科学理论和实际经验相结合的典范。这一次的总结工作为今后我国总结和推广先进经验的工作指出了正确的方向。
    在今年十一月召开全国织布工作法会议以前，中国纺织工会全国委员会和中央人民政府纺织工业部就先后收到青岛、天津、上海、东北、西北和石家庄大兴纱厂、唐山华新纱厂、山西晋华纱厂的织布工作法的总结。这些总结的本身就是运用郭瓦廖夫工作法集中群众优良经验的产物。如青岛总结的自动布机工作法是测定、比较了江爱芝、魏秀英、孙秀贞等七个工人的操作优点后得出的结论。这些总结使全国织布工作法会议总结全国的织布工人的先进经验成为可能。一九五一织布工作法中的自动布机工作法，就是以青岛的总结为基础，加上天津织布模范庞庆福对机器性能的了解，以及天津、东北、上海等地织布模范们的个别动作上的优点综合研究出来的。普通布机工作法是以天津的姜淑英、青岛的王建德两人的操作法相结合为基础，加上天津的王德山、青岛的王嘉祥以及上海织布模范们的优点综合研究出来的。因此，一九五一织布工作法就比任何地区的织布工作法和个别织布模范的操作经验更加优越，更为成熟。
    一九五一织布工作法的总结工作说明：总结先进经验必须使理论和实际相结合，体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合。这次全国织布工作法会议集中了全国的模范织布工人、工程师、技师和专家等七十多人，花了十六天的时间在天津的纱厂里实地进行表演、测定、分析、比较、研究等总结工作。在总结过程中，由于掌握了科学测定，过去许多在会议桌上单靠“理论”不易解决的问题现在得到了迅速的解决。如普通布机组在没有进行测定以前，认为天津姜淑英的工作法和青岛王建德的工作法比较好，但究竟那一个更好，大家的意见就很不一致。后来测定的结果说明：姜法比王法少走百分之六的路；如果姜淑英用王建德的动作操作，停台率可比王建德减少百分之零点三七；主动换梭和被动换梭的比例，姜法是四比一，王法是二比一。这就是说姜法比王法走路少，工作主动，而且产量高。这样两个工作法那一个更优越的问题就解决了。也由于掌握了科学测定，各种工作法中的优点就能完全保存下来。因此，这次总结出来的一九五一织布工作法便成为工作主动（巡回或换梭有规律）、质量高、原料省、不增劳动强度的全国可以普遍采用的织布工作法。
    一九五一织布工作法的总结工作也说明技术和政治必须紧密结合起来。会议初期有些代表不够虚心，抱着“打胜仗”、“比赛”的思想来开会。后来各地区代表分别开了小组会，作了自我检讨，订立了爱国公约，保证互相虚心学习。这样就在会议中形成了一种互相学习的风气。如青岛的工程师、工人向上海工人学习拆坏布的动作，上海工人向青岛学习巡回规律等。这样就给集中全国织布工人的操作优点造成了稳固的思想基础，保证了总结工作的顺利进行。同时，到会的织布工人代表因而在总结过程中都有丰富的收获。国营上海第六棉纺织厂织布女工华雁英在参观和学习一九五一织布工作法后说：“我在上海原来看十二台自动布机，就忙得不得了，照顾不好就出了次布。到天津后，在短短的四天中，已经学会了新的工作法。由于巡回有了规律，看台能力也提高了。我现在看三十二台布机还是不慌不忙，一匹次布也没有。”
