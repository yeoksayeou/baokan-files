Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The Preparatory Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union North China Regional Committee issued a notice on the 1st of this month, calling on state-owned coal mine workers in North China to launch an emulation drive for increased production and thrift, complete this year's planned increase of 66,500 tons of millet's worth of production and thrift by the end of the year, and make all preparations to strive for wealth equivalent to an increase of 150,000 tons of millet in 1952.

The notice stated that in the past year, in the patriotic labor emulation drive to resist US aggression and aid Korea, state-owned coal mine workers in North China have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, achieving great results. For example, the Jingxing, Datong, and Jiaozuo coal mines not only completed their annual production tasks 40 to 70 days ahead of schedule, but also saved cost expenses equivalent to 10,000 tons of millet from January to October. Therefore, as long as all workers continue to work hard, use their brains, plug loopholes, find tricks, and calculate carefully, the glorious task of increasing production and practicing thrift given by Chairman Mao can be fully completed.

The notice put forward the specific goals of the North China state-owned coal mines' increased production and thrift campaign for 1952: coal production to exceed the state plan by 11%; costs to be reduced by 6%; basic construction investment to be saved by 7%; and 80 billion yuan to be saved in the management of working capital and fixed assets. The notice pointed out that the directions of effort for increasing production and thrift are: 1. Do a good job in safety work, avoid or reduce accidents, in order to produce more and spend less money. 2. Improve technology and give full play to the effectiveness of machinery and equipment. 3. Rectify and improve labor organization. 4. Design correctly and do a good job in basic construction work. 5. Improve the quality of underground engineering, save raw materials, and reduce costs.

The notice also made important instructions on the leadership of the increased production and thrift campaign. The notice pointed out that union cadres in each mine must strengthen the political education of workers, assist them in formulating specific plans for increasing production and practicing thrift, and revise the patriotic pledges of the groups. Union members responsible for technical and administrative management must clearly rely on the working class, go deep into the front lines, help workers solve problems in production, strengthen the organizational leadership of the rationalization proposal committees, and launch rationalization proposal campaigns; summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner. The notice pointed out that each mine should formulate reward methods, reasonably adjust quotas, and care for the workers' lives, in order to consolidate the workers' production enthusiasm.

    【新华社四日讯】中国煤矿工会华北区筹备委员会本月一日发出通知，号召华北国营煤矿职工开展增产节约竞赛运动，在年底以前完成今年六万六千五百吨小米的增产节约计划，并作好一切准备工作，争取在一九五二年增产节约十五万吨小米的财富。
    通知说，一年来在抗美援朝爱国主义劳动竞赛中，华北国营煤矿职工发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，取得了很大的成绩。如井陉、大同、焦作等三个煤矿不但提前四十天到七十天完成了全年生产任务，并且在一月至十月份共节省了价值一万吨小米的成本费用。因此，只要全体职工继续努力，动脑筋，堵漏洞，找窍门，算细账，毛主席所给的光荣的增产节约任务是完全能够完成的。
    通知提出了一九五二年华北国营煤矿增产节约运动的具体奋斗目标：煤的生产量超过国家计划百分之十一；成本降低百分之六；基本建设投资节省百分之七；流动资金与固定资产的管理方面节约八百亿元。通知指出了增产节约的努力方向是：一、搞好安全工作，不出或少出事故，以便多生产，少花钱。二、改进技术，充分发挥机器设备的效能。三、整顿和改进劳动组织。四、正确设计，做好基本建设工作。五、提高井下工程质量，节约原材料，降低成本。
    通知对增产节约运动的领导问题，也作了重要指示。通知指出各矿工会干部必须加强对职工的政治教育，协助他们制订具体的增产节约计划，修订小组爱国公约。负责技术和行政管理方面工作的工会会员，必需明确依靠工人阶级、深入现场、帮助工人解决生产中的问题；加强合理化建议委员会的组织领导，开展合理化建议运动；及时总结和推广先进经验。通知指出各矿应制订奖励办法，合理调整定额，关心工人生活，以巩固工人的生产热情。
