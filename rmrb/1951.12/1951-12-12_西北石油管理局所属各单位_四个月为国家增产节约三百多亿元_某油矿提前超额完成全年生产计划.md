Northwest Petroleum Administration Affiliated Units
Four Months of Increased Production and Savings Totaling Over 30 Billion Yuan for the Nation
A Certain Oil Mine Completes the Annual Production Plan Ahead of Schedule and Exceeds the Target

The units affiliated with the Northwest Petroleum Administration launched an increase production and conserve campaign starting in July this year. By the end of October, in four months, they had increased production and saved a total of 30,160 million yuan for the country, completing 86% of the originally planned half-year increase production and conserve plan.

When the Northwest Petroleum Administration initially proposed the increase production and conserve plan, many cadres lacked confidence in completing it. They felt that the original production tasks were already very high and the financial plans were very precise, making further increase production and conservation impossible. In addition, some cadres had a simplistic task-oriented view that only focused on numbers. Therefore, at the beginning of the campaign, the units did not pay enough attention to fully mobilizing the masses, and the increase production and conserve campaign failed to develop vigorously. In early August of this year, the Northwest Petroleum Administration convened an expanded bureau meeting to educate cadres at all levels, determine the specific goals for each oil mine and marketing department, and clearly state the need to mobilize workers to formulate increase production and conserve plans and use their brains to find solutions. After this in-depth mobilization at the meeting, various units launched rationalization proposal campaigns. Workers put forward many good methods for increasing production and conserving resources, solving many problems that were previously considered unsolvable, thereby increasing the confidence of many cadres in completing the increase production and conserve plans. The distillation plant of a certain oil mine suffered from corrosion of the condenser tubes, and each furnace could only be operated for 20 to 30 days. This time, after workers’ research, they injected an appropriate concentration of alkaline water into the condenser to neutralize the acid in the oil. As a result, the furnace operation time was extended to 58 days. In the cracking plant, coking of the furnace tubes used to affect the furnace operation time. Now, the workers have adopted the method of steadily increasing the temperature, creating a new record of continuous furnace operation for 39 days and 15 hours. In the past, the temperature at the top of the vacuum distillation plant fractionation tower was always difficult to control. Some engineering technicians thought that since it was designed by Americans, there would be no errors. However, after the workers researched, they changed the drip-type fractionation plates to bubble cap-type fractionation plates. Not only was the temperature easier to control, but the reflux rate was also greatly reduced.

Due to the various methods for improving production researched by the workers, the output of oil mines affiliated with the Northwest Petroleum Administration increased month by month. Gasoline production exceeded the plan by 11% in July and by 19% in October. Kerosene production exceeded the plan by 40% in four months. The workers in the transportation department affiliated with the Petroleum Administration also came up with many ways to increase vehicle utilization and increase truck payload. The total mileage in July was 3.21 million ton-kilometers, and in October it increased to 4.58 million ton-kilometers. In addition, the workers saved on tires, gasoline, steel plates, and other materials. In four months, the transportation department increased production and conserved a total of 15.8 billion yuan.

A certain oil mine under the Northwest Petroleum Administration has already completed its annual production plan by 6.2% in early November. Currently, all the workers in the mine are striving to complete an additional increase production plan equivalent to 14.6% of this year's production plan before the end of the year.

Over the past year, the workers of the mine have greatly improved their level of awareness through patriotic education. They have conscientiously implemented the patriotic pact movement and carried out patriotic labor competitions, thereby ensuring the completion of the production plan. In the competition, the workers put forward more than 60 rationalization proposals and strengthened the maintenance work, so that the operating rate from January to September this year increased by more than 10% compared with last year. A major department of the mine greatly shortened the downtime for repairs, broke the previous highest record for furnace operation time, and increased productivity by 54% compared with last year.

Currently, various units of the mine are formulating contact contracts with the core content of ensuring the completion of the production plan and doing a good job in maintenance, and production will be further improved. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached photos)

    西北石油管理局所属各单位
    四个月为国家增产节约三百多亿元
    某油矿提前超额完成全年生产计划
    西北石油管理局所属各单位，从今年七月份起开展增产节约运动，到十月底止，四个月内共为国家增产节约了三百零一亿六千多万元，已完成原订半年增产节约计划的百分之八十六。
    西北石油管理局开始提出增产节约的计划时，很多干部对完成这项计划缺乏信心。他们觉得原来的生产任务已经很高，财务计划已很精确，不可能再增产节约。另外有些干部存在着单纯追求数字的任务观点。所以运动开始时各单位都没有注意充分发动群众，增产节约运动也未能蓬勃开展。今年八月初，西北石油管理局召开了扩大局务会议，对各级干部进行了教育，并确定了各油矿、运销部门的具体奋斗目标，明确地提出要发动职工订增产节约计划，开动脑筋想办法。经过这次会议的深入动员，各单位随着就展开合理化建议运动。职工们提出了许多增产节约的好办法，解决了许多过去认为无法解决的问题，从而提高了许多干部完成增产节约计划的信心。某油矿蒸馏厂因冷凝管腐蚀，每次开炉不过二、三十天，这次经过职工研究，在冷凝器内注入适当浓度的碱水，以中和油中的酸，结果使开炼时间延长到五十八天。裂炼厂过去因炉管结焦，影响开炼时间；现在职工们采取了稳步提高温度的办法，创造了连续开炼三十九天又十五小时的新纪录。真空蒸馏厂过去分馏塔顶温度总是不好控制，某些工程技术人员以为是美国人设计的，不会有错误。但经过工人研究，把淋滴式分馏板改为泡帽式分馏板以后，不但温度易于控制，而且回流量较前大大减少。
    由于职工们研究出各种改进生产的办法，西北石油管理局所属油矿的产量逐月增加。汽油产量七月份超过计划百分之十一，十月份就超过计划百分之十九。煤油产量在四个月内超过计划百分之四十。石油管理局所属运输部门的职工，也想出很多办法提高车辆利用率和提高汽车载重量，七月份总计行车三百二十一万吨公里，十月份就增加到四百五十八万吨公里；再加上职工们在轮胎、汽油、钢板等方面的节约，四个月中运输部门共增产节约了一百五十八亿元。（新华社）
    西北石油管理局某油矿已在十一月上旬超额百分之六点二完成了全年生产计划。现全矿职工正争取在年底前再完成等于今年生产计划百分之十四点六的增产计划。
    一年来，该矿职工经过爱国主义教育，觉悟程度大大提高。他们认真地推行了爱国公约运动，开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛，从而保证了生产计划的完成。在竞赛中，职工们提出了六十多件合理化建议，加强了检修工作，使今年一月至九月的运转率比去年提高了百分之十以上。该矿某主要部门，由于大大缩短了停炉修理时间，开炉时间突破了以往最高纪录，生产率较去年提高了百分之五十四。
    目前，该矿各单位正在订立以保证完成生产计划和做好检修工作为中心内容的联系合同，产量将更加提高。（新华社）（附图片）
