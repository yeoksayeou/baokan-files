Plagiarism is an Extremely Bad Practice
Correspondent Wu Yunxing Must Reform

To the Editors: Authenticity is the basic element of news. Without this element, news becomes unfounded rumors. As a correspondent for a Party newspaper, one should strictly adhere to this principle when reporting situations.

However, four articles written by Wu Yunxing, a correspondent for the Southern Anhui Daily (a cadre in the Culture and Education Section of the Southern Anhui Xuancheng Prefecture), have caused dissatisfaction among the masses because some of the content and facts were inconsistent. Readers Mao Fengzhu, Wei Junfu, Chen Youqin, and others criticized this dishonest writing attitude, and Comrade Wu Yunxing also made a "preliminary self-criticism for inaccurate news reporting" in the Southern Anhui Daily on November 10th. However, just a few days after his self-criticism, Wu Yunxing plagiarized and rewrote the news item "Workers of the Wuhu City People's Cultural Center's Film Education Work Team Successfully Experimented with Single-Line Broadcasting," which was published in the Southern Anhui Daily on November 10th, and submitted it to the People's Daily (see "Letters from Readers" page of this newspaper on December 5th). This again caused dissatisfaction among comrades at the Wuhu City Cultural Center. Wu Yunxing not only continued to plagiarize but also copied certain facts incorrectly. For example, the Southern Anhui Daily report stated that after the comrades of the Film Education Work Team successfully experimented with single-line broadcasting, they replaced all (including the previously used rubber) rubber wires in Wuhu City with single wires, saving a total of 8,000 yards of rubber wire. However, Comrade Wu Yunxing mistakenly changed this to "Now the city has added four loudspeakers, saving a total of 8,000 yards of rubber wire..." Comrade Wu Yunxing's behavior of continuing to plagiarize while also conducting a self-criticism is extremely bad. I sincerely point out his mistake again, hoping that he will thoroughly eradicate this bad practice.

    抄袭稿件是极恶劣的作风
    通讯员吴运兴必须改过
    编辑同志：真实性是新闻的基本要素，失去了这个要素，新闻就成了无中生有的造谣。作为一个党报的通讯员，在反映情况时，应该切实遵守这一原则。
    可是皖南日报的通讯员吴运兴同志（皖南宣城专署文教科干部）写给皖南日报的四个稿件，都因为其中有些地方和事实不符，引起了群众的不满。对这种不老实的写作态度，读者毛凤翥、韦俊甫、陈友琴等同志曾提出批评，吴运兴同志在十一月十日皖南日报也作了“对报道新闻不真实的初步检讨”。可是吴运兴同志检讨后没有几天，又把十一月十日皖南日报刊登的“芜湖市人民文化馆电影教育工作队工作人员，研究改用单线广播已经试验成功”的消息，抄袭改写后投寄给人民日报（见十二月五日本报“读者来信专页”），又引起芜湖市文化馆同志们的不满。吴运兴不但继续抄袭而且把某些事实抄错了。例如皖南日报这篇报道中说，电影教育工作队的同志们利用单线广播试验成功后，把全芜湖市所有（包括以前用的皮线）的皮线都改用单线，一共节省了八千码皮线；而吴运兴同志却错误地改为“现该市增设了喇叭四处，共节省皮线八千码……”。吴运兴同志这样一边检讨，一边又继续抄袭的行为，是极其恶劣的。现在我再次诚恳地指出他的错误，希望他彻底根除这种恶劣的作风。
