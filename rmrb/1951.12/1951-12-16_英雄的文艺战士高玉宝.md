    A heroic literary warrior has emerged from the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. His name is Gao Yu Bao. He is a file clerk in a certain infantry regiment, and he has written a novel of 300,000 words.
    Gao Yu Bao's educational level is very low; he has to ask people about seven or eight words for every ten he writes. He overcame all kinds of difficulties to write this book, and it took him one year and five months to complete it. This is an autobiographical novel that begins two years after the "September 18th Incident" when the Northeast fell, and continues until the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Guangxi. The protagonist is Gao Yu Bao himself and his family.
    Gao Yu Bao is from Sunjiatun, Fuxian County, Liaodong Province. He is twenty-five years old and grew up in a poor peasant family. He joined the People's Liberation Army in 1947, and the Chinese Communist Party in 1948. He has worked as a communication soldier, guard, military postman, and file clerk. Because he is active in his work, brave in combat, and unites with the masses, he is a people's hero who has been awarded six major merits and two minor merits.
    How did Gao Yu Bao start writing novels? His writing process is very moving.
    Gao Yu Bao only attended school for a little over a month, but he loved listening to stories, storytelling, and reading old novels since he was a child. He can recount all the books he has read. However, he couldn't write until he joined the People's Liberation Army. In August 1949, the troops were stationed north of Changsha City. At this time, he worked hard to learn to read and write, and he could write a hundred or so characters, but he still didn't know how to use most of the characters. On the morning of the 25th, Gao Yu Bao was learning to write when he suddenly saw someone reading the comic strip "Young Mao Zedong." After he borrowed it to read, Mao Zedong's childhood learning story deeply moved him. Especially when he read these words: "One day, Mao Zedong suddenly had a question: Why are the protagonists in the novels he has read always civil and military officials, talented scholars and beautiful women, and never a farmer?" Gao Yu Bao recalled the novels he had read before, and it was the same. So he burned the old novels he had kept with him and decided to read more new books. A few days later, the troops distributed a copy of "The Case of Wrongful Injustice" (describing the story of peasants overturning their situation). Gao Yu Bao associated the oppression suffered by the protagonist in the book with the oppression he had suffered before, and thought to himself: "Can't I write a book about my own sufferings and let all the poor brothers know about it?" He thought of the vicious faces of the Japanese devils, traitors, and landlords, and felt very hateful; he thought of his grandfather, mother, uncle, brother, and those who suffered, who died unjustly, and felt very sad. So he decided to write a book. He ordered a notebook, took out the old pen his second uncle had given him before he died, and began to write. Because his educational level was low, he didn't know how to write seventy or eighty percent of the words. He wrote a few lines of large characters, and a page was filled. But his will to write the book was firm. He said: If I can't write it in a year, I'll write it in two years; if I can't write it in two years, I'll write it in five years. I must write it. One is to let the poor brothers all over the country read it, remember the evil enemies, and hold their guns tighter, liberate all of China, and build a happy country in the future; or send the book home to my father and brother, and let them remember who our enemies are and who our relatives are, so as not to forget their roots.
    At this time, he was working as a military postman in the regiment. Every day, after distributing newspapers and letters, he buried himself in writing. If he didn't know how to write a word, he would either use a wrong character to replace it, or draw various graphic symbols to replace it. As for the words that he couldn't even draw, he simply drew a circle. He wrote and drew like this, and after writing a paragraph, he would ask someone about it, and then copy the whole paragraph clearly into another large notebook. Sometimes he had a lot of thoughts in his mind, but few words came out of his pen; sometimes he couldn't write it this way or that way, which forced him to sweat profusely and walk around the room. However, he always had to write it out before he could finish. He often stayed up very late at night writing.
    During the campaign to liberate Guangxi, the troops marched and fought continuously. Gao Yu Bao not only actively completed his work tasks, but also kept squeezing time to write. By December 1949, when the troops were suppressing bandits in Guangxi, Gao Yu Bao's book had already been written for more than a dozen chapters. A section chief named Chi from the Propaganda Section wrote two lines on his notebook to encourage him: "I hope you can continue to write it and make it like the novel 'How the Steel Was Tempered'." Comrade Sun Fengzhang, the regimental commander, knew that Gao Yu Bao was writing a book and often encouraged and helped him. The other comrades in the regimental headquarters knew about this, and no one did not encourage him, which gave Gao Yu Bao even greater courage.
    In June 1950, Gao Yu Bao was transferred to the regimental headquarters as a file clerk. In June, the weather was sultry. Gao Yu Bao lived in a small house of a rural villager, with the kitchen just outside the house. The small house was as stuffy as a steamer. He was afraid of losing documents, so he didn't go out of the house to enjoy the cool. In addition, he rushed to write day and night, and he fainted many times. However, he still insisted on writing during his lunch break, and he often wrote until one or two o'clock in the night when others were resting. When he wrote about his mother's death, he was too sad to continue writing, and he wrote for more than ten days that time.
    In January 1951, Gao Yu Bao completed the first draft of his autobiographical novel in Xijiao Village, Chao'an County, Guangdong. The sixth issue of the first volume of "Liberation Army Literature," published in November, published the first and last three sections of Gao Yu Bao's novel.
    We hope that Comrade Gao Yu Bao will continue to work hard, improve his cultural and various aspects of knowledge, and prepare to write better works in the future. We hope that more Gao Yu Bao-style heroes can emerge on our literary and art front.

    英雄的文艺战士高玉宝
    人民解放军第四野战军出现了一个英雄的文艺战士，名叫高玉宝。他是步兵某团的收发员，写了一部三十万字的长篇小说。
    高玉宝的文化水平很低，写十个字就得问人家七八个字。他写这本书克服了种种困难，经过一年零五个月才写成。这是一本自传小说，从“九一八”东北沦陷后两年写起，一直写到中国人民解放军解放广西为止，主人公就是高玉宝自己和他的家庭。
    高玉宝是辽东省复县孙家屯人，现年二十五岁，生长在一个贫农家庭里。一九四七年参加解放军，一九四八年加入了中国共产党，做过通讯员、警卫员、军邮员、收发员的工作。因为他工作积极，作战勇敢，团结群众，是一位立了六个大功两个小功的人民功臣。
    高玉宝是怎样写起小说来的？他的写作过程很动人。
    高玉宝只上过一个多月学，但自幼儿爱听故事，爱听说书，爱看旧小说。看过的书他都能说出来。可是直到参加解放军以前，还不会写字。一九四九年八月，部队住在长沙市北面。这时，他努力学习文化，能写上百来个字了，但大部分的字还不会使用。二十五日上午，高玉宝正在学写字，忽然看见别人在看连环画“少年毛泽东”，他借来看后，毛主席幼年学习的故事，使他深深地受了感动。特别是读到这几句话：“毛泽东有一天忽然发生了一个疑问：他所读过的小说中，主人公为什么总是文臣武将、才子佳人，永远看不见一个耕田汉？”高玉宝回想起自己从前看过的小说，也是如此。于是他把保存在身边的几本旧小说烧掉，决心要多看新书。不几天，部队里发下来一本“沉冤记”（描写农民翻身的故事），高玉宝从书中主人公所受的压迫，联想到自己从前受的压迫，心里想：“难道我就不能把自己的苦处写本书，叫穷哥们全知道吗？”他想起日本鬼子和汉奸、地主们的凶恶面孔，非常痛恨；想起屈死的爷爷、母亲、叔叔、弟弟和那些受难的人，心里非常难过。于是他下决心写一本书。他订上个本子，拿出他二叔临死时给他的旧钢笔，就开始写书了。因为他文化水平低，十分之七八的字都不会写，斗大的字，写上几行，
    一页书就写满了。但他写书的意志是坚定的。他说：一年写不成，写它两年，两年写不成，写它五年。一定要写出来。一方面叫全国穷哥们看了，记住万恶的敌人，枪杆子能握的更紧，解放了全中国，将来建设一个美满的国家；再不然把书寄回家去，给父亲和弟弟看，叫他们牢牢记住，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的亲人，免得他们忘本。
    这时，他在团里当军邮员，每天把报纸信件分发好了，就埋头写书。不会写的字，除写别字代替外，只得画各种图形符号来代替，至于连画也画不出的字，就干脆画个圆圈。他这样连写带画地写下去，写好一段，问人家一段，把整段的字全问清了，然后把这段誊清在另一个大本子上。他有时心里想的话多，笔下写出来的话少；有时这样写不行，那样写也不行，逼得他满头大汗，在房子里转来转去。可是，他总要把它写出来，才算完事。他常常晚上很晚还不睡觉，还在写书。
    在解放广西战役中，部队连续行军，连续战斗。高玉宝不仅积极完成工作任务，还一直在挤时间写书。当一九四九年十二月，部队在广西剿匪的时候，高玉宝的书已写了十几回了。宣教股一位姓迟的股长在他本子上题了两行字来鼓励他：“希望你能继续写下去，把它写成像‘钢铁是怎样炼成的’小说一样。”团长孙凤章同志知道高玉宝写书，经常鼓励他帮助他，团部的其他同志知道这事，没有一个不鼓励他的，这给高玉宝更大的勇气。
    一九五○年六月，高玉宝调到团司令部当收发员，六月天气，暑气熏人，高玉宝住在一个农村老百姓的小房里，房外就是厨房，小房闷热得像蒸笼一样。他怕丢失文件，也不出房乘凉，加上白天黑夜赶着写书，他昏迷过好多次。可是，他还是午睡不睡坚持写书，晚上别人休息了，他常常写到深夜一两点钟。写到母亲死的时候，他难过的写不下去了，那一回就写了十几天。
    一九五一年一月，高玉宝在广东潮安县西郊村完成了他的自传小说的初稿。十一月份出版的“解放军文艺”第一卷第六期，发表了高玉宝长篇小说中的前后三段。
    我们希望高玉宝同志继续努力，提高文化和各方面的知识，准备将来写出更好的作品，希望我们的文艺战线上能产生更多的高玉宝式的英雄。
