    The Worker's Hospital of the Jingxi Mining Area in Mentougou
    Should Not Neglect Patient Safety
    To the Editor: Responsible cadres at the Worker's Hospital of the Jingxi Mining Area in Mentougou, Beijing, do not value patient safety and display serious bureaucratic work styles. Qi Zongxian, a worker at a private coal mine in Mentougou, fell ill and was introduced by the trade union to the Worker's Hospital of the Jingxi Mining Area for treatment. The hospital could not diagnose the illness and asked Qi Zongxian to transfer to another hospital for treatment. The trade union sent Qi Zongxian to Beijing, but could not find a hospital that day, so he was carried back to the Worker's Hospital of the Jingxi Mining Area and requested temporary accommodation. However, the hospital refused to accept him, leaving Qi Zongxian freezing in the corridor for five hours before finally admitting him. On November 14th, a worker's family member, Yan Yan, attempted suicide and was seriously injured. The Civil Affairs Section of the district mobilized two nearby workers to carry her to the Worker's Hospital of the Jingxi Mining Area. At the time, Dai Quanxi, a cadre from the Civil Affairs Section, explained to the hospital that the Civil Affairs Section would be responsible for the hospitalization costs, and the People's Government of the district provided a supplementary letter of certification. However, the hospital did not prepare a ward for her, leaving her in a cold, empty room for a total of eight and a half hours. The hospital's excuse was: without a deposit, she could not stay in a ward. This problem was only resolved when the district People's Government sent an official letter. At 9:00 AM on December 12th, Zhen Enrong, an elderly woman in her sixties (a worker's family member), was hit by a coal transport train and seriously injured. The Mentougou Public Security Sub-bureau carried Zhen Enrong to the hospital for emergency treatment. At the time, the hospital did not want to admit Zhen Enrong because she did not have a guarantor. At 5:00 PM, the head of the Security Section of the Public Security Sub-bureau volunteered to act as guarantor, but the hospital still refused to allow it. The patient, Zhen Enrong, was frozen from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM and was still forced to be carried back. This hospital is specifically designed to provide medical care for coal miners, but in the four months since it opened, many such incidents have occurred. Relevant departments should immediately investigate and handle this matter.

### 门头沟京西矿区工人医院  不应忽视病人安全

    门头沟京西矿区工人医院
    不应忽视病人安全
    编辑同志：北京市门头沟京西矿区工人医院的负责干部，不重视病人安全，有严重的官僚主义作风。门头沟私营煤矿工人齐宗显得了病，经工会介绍到京西矿区工人医院治疗。这个医院诊断不了，要求齐宗显转院诊治。工会把齐宗显送到北京，当天没有找到医院，又抬回京西矿区工人医院，要求暂住，但这个医院竟拒绝接受，让齐宗显在走廊下一直冻了五小时，才收下了。十一月十四日，工人家属阎阎氏自杀未遂，伤势很重。这个区的民政科动员附近两个工人，把她抬到京西矿区工人医院。当时，民政科干部戴全锡向医院说明，住院治疗费用由民政科负责，并由这个区的人民政府补开了证明信。但这个医院不给她预备病房，把她放在一间冰冷的空屋子里，共放了八个半小时。医院的理由是：没有保证金，就不能住病房。这个问题直到区人民政府送去了正式的公函，才解决了。十二月十二日上午九时，六十多岁的甄恩荣（工人家属）被运煤火车撞倒，伤势很重。门头沟公安分局把甄恩荣抬送到这个医院急救。当时，医院因甄恩荣没有铺保，不想收留。下午五时，公安分局保安股股长自愿作保，医院还不允许。病人甄恩荣从上午九时冻到下午五时，仍旧被迫抬回去。这个医院专为医疗煤矿工人而设，但开业四个月以来，像这种事件已发生很多，有关部门应该立刻检查处理。
