    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition No. 118 has been published.
    This issue prominently features the report by Beria, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at the meeting in Moscow celebrating the October Revolution Day on November 6th: "The Thirty-Fourth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution," and publishes the article by Chipicka, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, celebrating the October Revolution Day, "The Victory of True Democracy."
    This issue publishes an article by Spahiu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, "Albania is Laying the Foundation for Socialism," celebrating November 8th - the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labor Party. Spahiu said: The Labor Party is the organizer of all the victories of the Albanian people, the true leader of the working masses, and a resolute fighter for the construction of socialism. This is because the Labor Party was established based on the organizational principles of the Bolshevik Party; it is because the Party chose Marxism-Leninism as its theoretical weapon, defeated "right" and "left" opportunists and Trotskyites; it is because the Party has taken the experience of the Bolshevik Party and the wise opinions of the great Stalin as its guide, whether in the national liberation struggle or in laying the foundation for socialism. Spahiu pointed out: During World War II, the Soviet army liberated Albania. After the attempts of the Anglo-American imperialists and their lackeys to sabotage the Albanian national liberation struggle completely failed, they did their best to obstruct Albania's recovery. However, the enemy could not suppress the development of the people's revolution. Under the leadership of the Labor Party, the masses carried out fundamental reforms in the economic, social, and cultural fields. The working class became the collective owner of the means of production. Land reform enabled peasants to obtain land. These reforms prepared the way for planned economy and laying the foundation for socialism, and stimulated the great enthusiasm of the masses. Spahiu then described how, under the leadership of the Labor Party and with the valuable assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the Albanian people smashed the sabotage conspiracy of the Tito fascist bandits, lackeys of American and British imperialism, and achieved major achievements in politics, economy, and culture. Spahiu finally emphasized: The American and British imperialists and their servants are preparing for another war. The Albanian Labor Party represents the interests of the working masses, so it opposes war and supports peace, opposes imperialism and supports the freedom of all peoples. The Party will always remember these words of the great Stalin: If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace, peace can be maintained and consolidated.
    This issue publishes an article by Lalmand, General Secretary of the Belgian Communist Party, "The Belgian Communist Party at the Combat Post," commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Party. Lalmand said: When the Belgian Communist Party was founded in September 1921, it had only a few hundred members. The enemy contemptuously called it the "517-man camp" and spared no effort to destroy this team of warriors dedicated to the cause of the working people. However, the heroic struggle of the Party won the growing sympathy of the working people. Cadres were tempered like steel in the struggle, and a large number of new members joined this team. For thirty years, the Party has experienced periods of progress and setbacks, but it has never given up the task of the vanguard of the working class for a minute. Lalmand then pointed out: The Belgian Communists are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Party under the conditions of extremely sharp struggles. People all over the world who are enthusiastically dedicated to the cause of peace are opposing the imperialist warmongers. In order to prepare for a new world war, American imperialism has rapidly turned Belgium into an aggression base for warmongers. The Belgian government's policy of preparing for war has increasingly worsened the lives of the working people. The people of the middle class have also felt the bad consequences of this policy. Increasingly widespread popular dissatisfaction is growing. Despite the violence, intimidation, and provocation of the reactionaries, the influence of the Communist Party is growing, and more and more people are enthusiastically supporting the Party's slogans. All this shows that the Belgian Communist Party's struggle against the warmongers and those who cause poverty in recent years has had an effect. Lalmand emphasized: We must do everything possible to establish closer ties with the masses and more closely integrate the struggle for bread and freedom with the great struggle for peace. The Party will strive to enable all Party members to master the theories of Marxism-Leninism more thoroughly, improve the ideological level within the Party, and make it easier for the Party to fight against opportunist and sectarian tendencies. Lalmand finally said: In celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party, the Belgian Communist Party guarantees that it will redouble its efforts to fight in order to achieve their primary task - to unite all the patriotic people and democrats in Belgium to strive for the independence of the motherland and the victory of the cause of peace.
    This issue also reported on the meeting of the World Peace Council in Vienna, and published news of the Belgian Communist Party commemorating the 30th anniversary of its founding and the Finnish and Austrian Communist Parties convening their congresses. This issue also continued to report on the grand occasion of the people of various countries celebrating the 34th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一一八期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一一八期已经出版。
    本期以显著地位刊载了苏联部长会议副主席贝利亚十一月六日在莫斯科庆祝十月革命节大会上的报告：“伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年”，并登载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团委员契皮茨卡的庆祝十月革命节的文章“真正民主制度的胜利”。
    本期发表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会书记斯巴休的“阿尔巴尼亚在奠定社会主义基础”一文，庆祝十一月八日——阿尔巴尼亚劳动党建党十周年纪念日。斯巴休说：劳动党是阿尔巴尼亚人民的一切胜利的组织者，是劳动群众的真正领袖，是为建设社会主义而斗争的坚决战士。这是由于劳动党是根据布尔什维克党的组织原则建立的；是由于党选择了马列主义作为理论武器，打败了“右”倾和“左”倾机会主义者及托洛茨基分子；是由于党不管在民族解放斗争中还是在为社会主义奠定基础的时候，都以布尔什维克党的经验和伟大斯大林的英明意见为指南。斯巴休指出：在第二次世界大战期间，苏联军队解放了阿尔巴尼亚。英美帝国主义者及其走狗想破坏阿尔巴尼亚民族解放斗争的企图完全失败以后，就竭尽全力来阻挠阿尔巴尼亚的复兴。但是，敌人却抑制不了人民革命的发展。劳动党领导群众在经济、社会和文化方面进行了根本的改革。工人阶级变成了生产手段的集体所有者。土地改革使农民获得了土地。这些改革给计划经济和奠定社会主义基础的工作作了准备，激发了人民群众的巨大热情。斯巴休接着叙述了阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，在苏联和人民民主国家的宝贵援助下，粉碎美英帝国主义走狗铁托法西斯匪帮的破坏阴谋，在政治、经济、文化各方面获得了重大成就。斯巴休最后强调说：美英帝国主义者及其仆从正在准备另一次战争。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表着劳动群众的利益，因此它反对战争、拥护和平，反对帝国主义、拥护各族人民的自由。党永远记得伟大斯大林的这些话：如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，和平就能够保持和巩固。
    本期刊载了比利时共产党总书记拉尔曼的“在战斗岗位上的比利时共产党”一文，纪念党的三十周年。拉尔曼说：比利时共产党在一九二一年九月成立时，只有几百个党员。敌人轻蔑地称之为“五百一十七人营”，并且不遗余力地破坏这一支献身于劳动人民事业的战士的队伍。但是，党的英勇斗争赢得了劳动人民日渐增加的同情。干部们在斗争中锻炼得像钢铁一般坚强，大量新党员参加了这支队伍。三十年来党经历了前进和挫折的时期，但是一分钟也没有放弃过工人阶级先锋队的任务。拉尔曼接着指出：比利时共产党人是在伟大的斗争异常尖锐化的条件下庆祝党的三十周年的。热烈献身于和平事业的全世界人民，正在反对帝国主义战争贩子们。美帝国主义为了准备新的世界大战，已迅速地变比利时为战争贩子的侵略基地。比利时政府准备战争的政策已使劳动人民的生活日益恶化。中间阶层的人民也感受到了这种政策的恶果。越来越广泛的人民的不满情绪正在增涨。尽管有着反动派的暴力、恫吓和挑衅手段，共产党的影响越来越大，愈来愈广大的人民热烈拥护党的口号。这都表明了比利时共产党近几年来反对战争贩子和那些造成贫困现象的人们的斗争，已经产生了效果。拉尔曼强调说：我们必须尽一切力量和群众建立更为密切的联系，把争取面包和自由的斗争与争取和平的伟大斗争更紧密地结合起来。党将努力使所有的党员愈益透彻地精通马恩列斯的学说，提高党内思想水平，使党便于对机会主义和宗派主义偏向进行斗争。拉尔曼最后说：在庆祝我党成立三十周年时，比利时共产党保证将加倍努力进行斗争，以便实现他们的首要任务——团结比利时所有的爱国人民和民主人士，以争取祖国的独立及和平事业的胜利。
    本期还报道了世界和平理事会在维也纳举行会议的情况，并刊载了比利时共产党纪念建党三十周年和芬兰、奥地利共产党召开代表大会的消息。本期还继续报道了各国人民庆祝十月革命节三十四周年的盛况。                （新华社）
