    Heroic Nurse An Yu’ai
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Pu
    In a Korean People's Army unit, commanders and soldiers alike are praising the immortal deeds of the heroic nurse An Yu'ai with boundless reverence.

    An Yu'ai was a twenty-two-year-old girl, an excellent member of the Labor Party. At the start of the war last year, she joined the work of a field hospital of the People's Army.

    One clear day in May this year, An Yu'ai was working in the ward. Four enemy planes suddenly flew over the village, firing wildly with machine guns at this tranquil place. In the ward were seven People's Army soldiers severely wounded and unable to move. At the time, a gasoline bomb was already burning in the adjacent room. The strong smell of gasoline and thick black smoke poured into the ward, and the wounded soldiers groaned in pain from the fumes. An Yu'ai calmly said to the wounded soldiers: "Comrades, it doesn't matter, I will carry you out quickly!"

    She immediately carried a wounded soldier on her back and ran towards an air-raid shelter not far from the house, sending him there and immediately returning to carry another; nobody knew where she got such great strength, but she carried six severely wounded soldiers back and forth in succession.

    When she returned to carry the last wounded soldier, the ward was already roaring with flames, half of the roof was burned away, and sparks were constantly falling. She walked to the door, the raging fire burned her face like a knife, and a cloud of thick smoke almost suffocated her. She held her breath and rushed into the house. In a corner, she felt for the last wounded soldier who had lost consciousness from the burns, quickly carried him on her back, and desperately rushed out of this blazing ward, running towards the air-raid shelter.

    An enemy plane swooped down at her with a piercing shriek, and there was nowhere to hide on the road, so she immediately put the wounded soldier on the ground and shielded him with her body. The wounded soldier anxiously pushed her and said, "Don't worry about me, hide yourself quickly!" But An Yu'ai did not move, shielding the wounded soldier tightly with her body. At this moment, the sinful enemy plane continued to strafe, and three American machine gun bullets hit the body of the heroic nurse An Yu'ai. She trembled for a moment, and then fainted.

    When she was rescued and woke up, many comrades-in-arms surrounded her. Her first words were, with difficulty, "How is the wounded soldier?" Her comrades told her the wounded soldier was safe. A smile immediately appeared on her pale face. Then she took out her Labor Party membership card and all her money from her pocket, handed them to the deputy political instructor, and then said in a weak voice: "This is my last party membership fee."

    The doctor did everything possible to give her emergency treatment, but her breathing gradually became shorter. Her comrades-in-arms stood silently by her side, listening to her intermittently shouting: "Long live the Labor Party!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!"

    This young heroic nurse, who gave her life for the motherland, will live forever in the hearts of all soldiers. All the People's Army soldiers who knew An Yu'ai expressed with grief and indignation: "We will avenge An Yu'ai!"

    英雄护士安玉爱
    新华社记者　赵　普
    在一个朝鲜人民军的部队里，指挥员和战斗员们都怀着无限崇敬的心情，颂扬着英雄护士安玉爱的不朽事迹。
    安玉爱是一位二十二岁的姑娘，优秀的劳动党党员。在去年战争开始时，她参加了人民军某战地医院的工作。
    今年五月的一个晴朗的日子，安玉爱正在病房里工作。四架敌机突然飞到村子的上空，用机枪疯狂地扫射这个静谧的村庄。病房里有七个不能动弹的人民军重伤员。当时，一个汽油弹已经在隔壁的房间里燃烧起来。强烈的汽油味和浓烈的黑烟冲进了病房，伤员们被熏得发出了痛苦的呻吟。安玉爱镇定地对伤员们说：“同志们，不要紧，我很快地把你们背出去！”
    她立即背起一个伤员向离房子不远的一个防空洞跑去，送到后马上返回来再背另一个；也不知从那里来的那么大的劲，她接连地来回背出了六个重伤员。
    当她回来背最后一个伤员时，病房已经呼呼地吐着火苗，房顶烧去了一半，火星不时地掉落下来。她走到门口，烈火灼得她脸上像刀割似的，一团团浓烟直逼得她几乎透不过气来。她屏住呼吸，猛冲进屋去。在一个角落里，她摸到了已经被烧得失去知觉的最后一个伤员，赶紧把他背到背上，拚命地冲出了这间大火熊熊的病房，向防空洞跑去。
    一架敌机带着尖啸声向她俯冲下来，路上无处可躲，她立即把伤员放在地上，用自己的身体掩护着他。那位伤员急得推着她说：“你不要管我，自己快隐蔽去吧！”但是安玉爱一动也不动，把自己的身体紧紧地掩护着伤员。这时，罪恶的敌机继续扫射，三颗美国机关枪子弹打中了英雄护士安玉爱的身体，她颤动了一下后，就晕过去了。
    当她被抢救后苏醒过来时，许多战友们围着她。她第一句话就吃力地问道：“伤员怎样了？”战友们告诉她伤员很安全。她苍白的脸上立即露出了笑容。接着她从衣袋里掏出了劳动党的党证和所有的钱，交给了副政治指导员，然后，用微弱的声音说：“这是我最后的一次党费。”
    医生全力地对她施行急救，但她的呼吸却渐渐地短促起来。她的战友们静肃地站在她身边，听着她断断续续地喊着：“劳动党万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”
    这位年青的为祖国献出了自己生命的英雄护士，将永远活在所有战士们的心里。所有知道安玉爱的人民军将士们都悲愤地表示：“我们要给安玉爱报仇！”
