    The Propaganda Work of Party Organizations in State-Owned Enterprises in Northeast China During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    By Our Special Correspondent Fu Zhensheng
    The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in state-owned and public-owned enterprises in the Northeast region, under the correct leadership of Comrade Gao Gang and the Northeast Bureau, and thanks to the active efforts of all cadres and the working class, has achieved tremendous results. The region's plan for increased production and practicing economy has exceeded more than ten million tons of grain. Currently, various localities are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, continuing to expand and deepen the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, and striving for greater achievements.
    To complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's political work. Propaganda and education work is one of the most important elements of the Party's political work. Therefore, how to further strengthen the Party's propaganda work in enterprises to more effectively promote the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign is a very urgent issue. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in its "Resolution on the Party's Leadership of State-Owned Enterprises," pointed out: "The political work of Party organizations in factories and mines must serve economic tasks and must be correctly combined with economic work." "Strengthen the political education of cadres and Party members, combine it with the central tasks of each period and the specific ideological trends of employees, and conduct propaganda and mobilization work at any time to make all employees understand the consistency between developing production and improving life, combine production tasks with political tasks, and transform the realization of the Party's resolutions and the completion of factory and mine plans into the practical actions of the broad masses. Organize cadres and Party members to study economic work, technology, and the science of managing production and organizing labor, so that they become experts in managing enterprises." This is completely correct and is the Party's basic task and basic policy in enterprises.
    After the Northeast Bureau announced this instruction, it aroused great attention from Party committees at all levels and greatly enhanced their understanding of the importance of the Party's propaganda work. However, this does not mean that everyone has understood the importance of this issue. For example, in the early stages of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, some units juxtaposed the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda, the promotion of Patriotic Compacts, and the Quality Inspection Campaign. They focused on the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea propaganda (which was correct), but did not pay enough attention to the propaganda for increasing production, practicing economy, and the quality inspection campaign, resulting in the isolation of the Patriotic Compacts promotion. For example, some units failed to grasp the actual production situation well and conduct specific propaganda targeting the ideological situation of employees, but instead gave general lectures on patriotism; therefore, their propaganda was dry and hard to resonate with people. Some comrades did not have enough understanding of the ideological and political nature of the Party's propaganda work, so that they failed to raise the current economic tasks to a certain political height and carry out propaganda and mobilization. In view of this situation, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, in order to further implement the spirit of the May Northeast Bureau Urban Work Conference, held a work conference on propaganda in factories and mines on August 8. The conference, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, reviewed some of the shortcomings of the Party's propaganda work in factories and mines in the past. It emphasized that enterprise propaganda work must serve the Party's central tasks in each period and must be correctly combined with the current production tasks. This conference also promoted the typical experience of a certain factory in combining political work with economic work. This conference played a certain role in widely carrying out the propaganda for the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign.
    In the past few months, thanks to the attention of Party committees at all levels, the joint efforts of administrative departments, trade unions, and youth league organizations, enterprise propaganda work has made some new progress and shown new vitality. Some advanced factories and mines have created some relatively mature experiences. At present, enterprise propaganda work in the region is still developing unevenly. The degree of attention varies from place to place, so the speed of progress is also inconsistent. In order to exchange experiences and further improve the level of enterprise propaganda work, it is necessary for us to initially organize the past experiences and point out some of the laws of enterprise propaganda work.
    (1) Combine with the central tasks of each period and the specific ideological trends of employees, carry out propaganda work in a timely manner, combine production tasks with political tasks, raise the awareness of the working class, unify ideological understanding, and transform the realization of the Party's resolutions and the completion of factory and mine plans into the practical actions of the broad masses.
    Whenever a central task for a period comes down, the Party committee and the Party's propaganda department should first take the initiative to conduct political work among leaders and cadres at all levels, find out the key production problems and ideological obstacles in all aspects through studying the instructions of the higher authorities, organizing reports in a timely manner, launching discussions, and checking the specific situation of the unit, and conduct propaganda according to this specific ideological situation. Only propaganda work carried out in this way is realistic and "directed at the target." For example, when a factory started quality inspection, it first identified six key quality issues and four ideological obstacles through studying documents and specifically inspecting the factory's production situation and problems. The four ideological obstacles are: First, leaders, cadres, and technical personnel do not have a clear understanding of the key to improving quality, that is, strengthening technical management and improving technology. Specifically, Party, administrative, trade union, and youth league cadres at the factory level do not pay attention to technical improvement work; the Party committee does not pay attention to the ideological leadership of technical personnel; technical personnel lack the spirit of combining theory with practice and being serious and responsible, and do not pay attention to workers' opinions, "talking about soldiers on paper"; some workers do not comply with or deliberately violate technical operating procedures, and do not pay attention to learning and improving technology; Second, they do not have a strong sense of responsibility to the country. Each unit shirks responsibility when encountering problems. Some work group leaders protect workers in their group who produce defective products, and many workers conceal defective products; Third, complacency. Comparing with the production results during the puppet Manchurian period, comparing with the period of Kuomintang rule, comparing with the early days of liberation. Many people said, "At that time, defective products were hauled by carts, and now they are carried by hand"; Fourth, empiricism. Old workers with complex operating techniques use their naked eyes instead of scientific instruments; lathe and fitter workers use their hands instead of micrometers. After the factory's leading cadres studied the current key production issues and ideological obstacles, they carried out extensive propaganda through various organizations and using various propaganda tools. They focused on criticizing the views of neglecting quality and neglecting technical management, and established the concept of quality. For another example, the Rubber Factory No. 4 has many new workers. Their morale often fluctuated in the early stages of increasing production and practicing economy; they did not have a clear understanding of the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and two workers had already left the factory to make shoes in the city. After careful investigation and research, the leading cadres believed that there were still petty-handicraft and small-peasant ideologies among the workers. These people did not have a clear understanding of the working class's class status and bright future, and did not have a clear understanding of the relationship between developing production and improving personal life. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the typical examples among the workers, criticize the petty-handicraft workers' thinking of "mending broken shoes," and criticize the small-peasant thinking of "feeling sorry for losing a chicken heart, but not feeling sorry for losing a donkey" (meaning caring about personal interests but not caring about national interests) to establish the working class's thinking of "knowing the cost of firewood and rice when in charge." They conducted extensive propaganda work among the workers through propagandists, explaining the working class's leading position today, the working class's bright future, and explaining that today's construction is precisely for the future communist society. On the basis of this ideological education, education was carried out to carefully calculate and "tap potential." As a result, the working class's production enthusiasm was greatly enhanced, and great achievements were made in increasing production and practicing economy.
    Therefore, in the central task of each period, in addition to publicizing the political and economic significance of this central task, explaining the current situation, and explaining the significance of this economic task for national construction and for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to inspire the political awareness and production enthusiasm of all employees, technical personnel, and the working class, the Party's propaganda work must also conduct in-depth and meticulous propaganda work based on the specific ideological situation of workers in the production movement. Only ideological education work carried out so deeply and realistically can thoroughly solve problems. Only in this way can the Party's propaganda work truly serve production and can the political work and economic work be correctly combined. If the propaganda work is only satisfied with the general propaganda of current affairs and policies, only explains general principles, but does not touch or rarely touches the specific ideological obstacles existing among employees, then this kind of propaganda will be like "floating clouds passing over the moon," unable to truly penetrate the hearts of the people and unable to produce practical results.
    In terms of specific practices, some factories and mines also have some relatively good experiences. Their leaders have formed a pattern. Whenever a movement arrives, they always first carry out deliberation and discussion among the factory-level cadres to achieve complete ideological unity, and then conduct investigation and research among technical personnel and veteran workers; and conduct deliberation among the masses; and pay attention to obtaining accurate experience through pilot projects. After the factory-level cadres have deliberated and have a preliminary plan, they expand the scope of deliberation through various meetings, from factory-level cadres to propagandists, to employees and technicians, to workshop-level cadres, and then to team leaders (through team leader training classes) and all workers. This method of combining leadership deliberation with mass deliberation fully demonstrates the idea of relying on the working class and promotes the creativity of the working class, and avoids commandism. Only after such steps, first seeking ideological unity among leaders at all levels, can a reliable foundation be prepared for carrying out extensive propaganda among workers and technicians. From the surface, this approach seems to be very slow (sometimes their preparatory work takes half a month to twenty days), and it also seems that it is not "vigorous," but their work is indeed done very practically and step by step. They are advancing with positions, and their propaganda work truly penetrates the hearts of the people.
    (2) The whole Party does propaganda work, unifies steps, gives play to the enthusiasm of various organizations, and concentrates the use of propaganda forces.
    In state-owned and public-owned enterprises, the basic tasks of the Party organization, the administrative organization, the trade union organization, and the Youth League organization are to improve production and complete the state production plan. Only by working together through these systems, making efforts from various different aspects, actively improving the political awareness of the working class, mobilizing and organizing the working class, and striving to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, improve technology, and accelerate capital turnover, can we achieve the state's production, financial, and technical plans. Therefore, to do a good job of the Party's propaganda work and ensure the completion of the state's economic tasks, in addition to the propaganda department actively making efforts and taking the initiative to carry out work, there must also be the unified leadership of the Party committee, the active participation and support of administrative cadres, and the active cooperation of the trade union and the Youth League to mobilize the forces from all aspects and carry out propaganda work on an extremely large scale to exert the great power of propaganda work.
    However, to mobilize the whole Party to do propaganda work in a central task, there must be a series of organizational work and an in-depth process of ideological preparation. Otherwise, the so-called whole Party doing propaganda work will fall through. In the current situation, this organizational work and ideological preparation work are mainly in two aspects: on the one hand, mobilizing cadres and organizations at all levels of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League to carry out propaganda work; on the other hand, consciously using the propaganda network in each movement and constantly improving the level of reporters and propagandists. In these two aspects, some factories and mines have gained some relatively good experience. As mentioned above, in each central task, the leaders in some of the mentioned factories and mines, from the factory-level cadres to the workshop-level cadres (including propagandists), have fully deliberated, clarified the key issues of the current situation, grasped various ideological situations, and determined the main content of the propaganda. This process of ideological deliberation is also the process of organizing propaganda forces and mobilizing the whole Party to do propaganda work. After this preparation, once the order is given, propaganda work can be carried out with "thousands of troops and horses," and the momentum is extraordinary. For example, in carrying out large-scale propaganda, the fifth workshop of a certain factory concentrated the use of all the workshop's propaganda tools and propaganda forces, all unified in propagating the content stipulated by the Party branch. Each Party member and League member made a plan to ensure that they would carry out propaganda to a certain target. The branch checks the work at any time according to these plans. All the workshop's propagandists are assigned "contracted responsibilities" for propaganda according to each person's strengths and work posts. Foremen, group leaders, employees, and technicians are mobilized to do propaganda to workers. All the blackboards, reading groups, cartoons, charts, and all meetings in the workshop focus on the established content as the propaganda center. In this way, a strong atmosphere can be created in the workshop, making everything the workers see and hear related to this matter. This kind of propaganda has a strong appeal to workers, and the propaganda effect is relatively prominent. Secondly, we should always pay attention to using the propaganda network and training propagandists. The Party Committee of Northeast China Pharmaceutical Factory attaches great importance to the propaganda network and greatly exerted the role of propagandists. In the first half of the year, propagandists who were frequently effective accounted for only 21.5%, those who were not frequently effective accounted for 66.6%, and those who were completely ineffective accounted for 11.8%. The situation in the second half of the year was completely different. Those who were frequently effective rose to 54.8%, those who were not frequently effective fell to 45.2%, and those who were completely ineffective disappeared. Their experience in leading the propaganda network is mainly: First, the Party committee attaches importance to it. The Party committee regards the propaganda network as an important tool for realizing its ideological leadership and carries this point of view throughout the workshop. They found two different typical examples (one that attaches importance to the propaganda network and one that does not), and launched discussions among the workshop cadres to improve their understanding of the propaganda network; Second, implement a propagandist diary system, regularly check and help the work of propagandists; Third, let the propagandists meet with the masses (announced to the masses), prepare conditions for the propagandists to conduct activities among the masses; Fourth, hold a good propagandist meeting chaired by the branch secretary. For another example, the leading cadres of the Dongcai Coal Mining Section of the Fushun Open-pit Mine have established a relatively sound system for leading the propaganda network. A propagandist conference is held once a month to summarize and arrange work; three team leader joint meetings are held to study and check work, and a team meeting is held every week to report work and reflect the situation. In addition, every morning from 7:00 to 8:00 is fixed as propagandists' study time. Each propagandist has a specific division of labor, and the propaganda area and target are fixed, so the propaganda activities are very regular. Secondly, the reporters and propagandists cooperate more closely. The reporter of the Party's general branch reports to the propagandists three times a month, specifically explains the tasks of each period, instructs the propagandists on the guiding principles, purposes, and steps of the work, helps analyze the masses' thinking, solves work difficulties, and guides the work methods. The propagandists are responsible for reflecting the production situation, the ideological trends and requirements of the masses. Due to the close combination of reporters and propagandists in work, the Party's general branch grasps the situation, discovers and solves problems more quickly; because the propagandists have the help of the reporters, many difficulties have been solved. Therefore, we believe that if the Party's leading cadres can always pay attention to using the forces of all aspects to carry out large-scale propaganda, so that the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League cooperate from all aspects, and at the same time can always train and use the propaganda network, then the requirement of the whole Party doing propaganda work will definitely be realized, and the Party's propaganda work will inevitably usher in a new situation.

    东北国营企业党组织在增产节约运动中的宣传工作
    本报特约记者　富振声
    东北区国公营企业的增产节约运动，在高岗同志和东北局的正确领导下，由于全体干部和工人阶级的积极努力，已获得了巨大的成绩。全区增产节约计划，已超过一千余万吨粮食。目前各地正热烈响应毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的号召，继续扩大和深入增产节约运动，为争取更大的成绩而奋斗。
    为了完成增产节约任务，必须加强党的政治工作。而宣传教育工作，是党的政治工作的重要部分之一。因此，如何进一步加强党在企业中的宣传工作，以便更有力地推动增产节约运动，便是一个十分迫切的问题。中共中央东北局在“关于党对国营企业领导的决议”中指出：“厂、矿中党组织的政治工作，必须服务于经济任务，必须与经济工作正确地结合。”“加强干部和党员的政治教育，结合每个时期的中心工作及职工具体思想动态，随时进行宣传鼓动工作，使全体职工懂得发展生产与改善生活的一致性，将生产任务与政治任务结合起来，将实现党的决议与完成厂矿的计划，变为广大群众的实际行动。组织干部和党员学习经济业务，学习技术，学习管理生产与组织劳动的科学，使自己成为管理企业的内行。”这是完全正确的，这是党在企业中的基本任务和基本方针。
    东北局这一指示公布后，引起了各地党委极大的重视，大大提高了各地党委对于党的宣传工作的认识。但是，这并不是说，所有的人都已经理解了这个问题的重要性。比如，在增产节约运动初期，有的单位把抗美援朝宣传、推行爱国公约运动和质量检查运动对立起来。他们抓紧了抗美援朝宣传（这是对的），但对增产节约和质量大检查的宣传，则注意的很不够，结果使爱国公约的推行陷于孤立。又如有些单位未能很好地掌握生产实际情况，并针对职工的思想情况，具体地进行宣传，而是泛泛地讲述爱国主义；因此，他们的宣传是干巴巴地，不易深入人心。有些同志，对党的宣传工作的思想性、政治性认识不足，以致未能把当前的经济任务，提高到一定的政治高度，进行宣传鼓动。东北局宣传部鉴于这种情况，为了进一步贯彻五月东北局城市工作会议的精神，在八月八日召开了工矿宣传工作会议。会议以批评自我批评精神，检讨了过去工矿中党的宣传工作的若干缺点。强调指出：企业宣传工作必须为各个时期党的中心任务服务，必须和当前生产任务正确结合。这次会议，并推广了某厂政治工作与经济工作结合的典型经验。这次会议，对于广泛开展增产节约运动宣传上，起了一定的作用。
    几个月来，由于各级党委的重视，行政部门，工会和青年团组织的共同努力，企业宣传工作已获得了一些新的进展，出现了新的气象。某些先进厂矿已创造了一些比较成熟的经验。目前，全区企业宣传工作，仍然是发展不平衡的。各地重视程度不同，因此，进展的速度也不一致。为了交流经验，进一步提高企业宣传工作水平，我们把过去的经验加以初步整理，并指出企业宣传工作的某些规律，这是十分必要的。
    （一）结合每个时期的中心任务和职工具体思想动态，及时进行宣传工作，把生产任务和政治任务结合起来，提高工人阶级觉悟，统一思想认识，把实现党的决议和完成厂矿的计划，变为广大群众的实际行动。
    每当一个时期的中心任务下来时，党委和党的宣传部门，首先应即主动地在各级领导干部中进行政治工作，通过学习上级指示、及时组织报告、展开讨论、检查本单位具体情况等方法，找出生产的关键问题和各方面的思想障碍，并根据这种具体思想状况，进行宣传。只有这样进行的宣传工作，才是实事求是和“有的放矢”的。如某厂在质量检查开始时，首先通过学习文件和具体检查本厂生产情况及问题，找出了质量上的六个关键问题和四种思想障碍。这四种思想障碍是：一、领导干部和技术人员对提高质量的关键，即，加强技术管理，提高改进技术，认识不清楚。具体表现在厂一级党、行政、工会、青年团干部，不重视技术改进工作；党委不重视对于技术人员的思想领导；技术人员缺乏结合实际和认真负责的精神，不重视工人意见，“纸上谈兵”；有些工人不遵守或故意违犯技术操作规程，不注意学习和提高技术；二、对国家的责任心不强。各单位遇到问题，互相推诿。有的工组长包庇本组造成废品的工人，很多工人隐瞒废品；三、自满思想。和伪满时的生产成绩比，和国民党统治时期比，和解放初期比。许多人说：“那时废品用大车拉，现在用手棒”；四、经验主义。操作技术复杂的老工人，不用科学仪器，而用肉眼；车钳工不用千分尺而用手摸。这个厂的领导干部研究了当前的生产关键和思想障碍之后，即通过各种组织，利用各种宣传工具，进行广泛宣传。着重批判轻视质量和轻视技术管理的观点，树立质量观点。又如橡胶四厂，新工人很多，他们在增产节约初期，情绪常有波动；他们对增产节约的意义认识不清，而且有两个工人已离厂到市上掌鞋去了。领导干部经过仔细调查研究，认为在工人中还存在小手工业思想和小农思想。这些人对工人阶级的阶级地位和远大前途认识不清，对发展生产和改善个人生活的关系认识不清。因此，必须抓住工人中的典型事例，批判小手工业者的掌破鞋思想，并批判丢鸡心疼、丢驴心不疼的小农思想（意即关心个人利益，不关心国家利益），以树立工人阶级的“当家要知柴米贵”的思想。他们通过宣传员，在工人群众中进行了广泛的宣传工作，说明工人阶级今天的领导地位，说明工人阶级的远大前途，说明今天的建设正是为了将来的共产主义社会。在这种思想教育的基础上，进行了算细账“挖潜力”的教育。结果，大大提高了工人阶级的生产积极性，使增产节约获得很大成绩。
    因此，在每一时期的中心工作中，党的宣传工作，除了应该宣传这一中心工作的政治的经济的意义，说明当前的形势，说明这一经济任务对国家建设和对抗美援朝的意义，以启发全体职员、技术人员和工人阶级的政治觉悟及生产积极性外，还必须根据生产运动中工人所发生的具体思想情况，进行深入细腻的宣传工作。只有这样深入地切合实际地进行思想教育工作，才能彻底解决问题。也只有这样地进行党的宣传工作，才是真正为生产服务，才是政治工作和经济工作的正确结合。如果宣传工作只满足于一般时事政策宣传，只讲解一般的道理，而对职工中存在的具体思想障碍，却毫不接触或很少触及，那么，这种宣传便如“浮云掠月”一样，不能真正深入人心，不能发生实际效果。
    在具体做法上，某些厂矿也有一些比较好的经验。他们的领导已形成一种规律。每当一个运动到来时，他们总是首先在厂一级干部中，进行酝酿讨论，取得思想上的完全一致，再向技术人员和老工人进行调查研究；并在群众中进行酝酿；注意通过试点，取得确切经验。在厂级干部酝酿成熟并有了初步计划之后，就通过各种会议，扩大酝酿范围，由厂级干部扩大到宣传员，扩大到职员、技术人员，扩大到车间一级干部，再扩大到班组长（通过班组长训练班）和全体工人。这种领导干部酝酿同时结合广大群众酝酿的方法，充分发挥了依靠工人阶级的思想，发扬了工人阶级的创造力，而且避免了命令主义。只有经过这样的步骤，首先求得各级领导在思想上的一致，才能为在工人和技术人员中进行广泛宣传，准备可靠的基础。这种做法，从表面看来，好像是很缓慢（有时他们的准备工作要半月到二十天），也好像是不够“轰轰烈烈”，但是，他们的工作确实做的很踏实，很有步骤，他们是有阵地地前进，他们的宣传工作是真正地深入人心。
    （二）全党做宣传工作，统一步骤，发挥各个组织的积极性，集中使用宣传力量。
    在国公营企业中，党的组织、行政组织、工会组织和青年团的组织，其基本任务都是为了提高生产，完成国家生产计划。只有经过这些系统，从各个不同方面，努力配合工作，积极提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，动员和组织工人阶级，为增加产量、提高质量、降低成本、改进技术、加速资金周转而奋斗，才能实现国家的生产、财务、技术计划。因此，要做好党的宣传工作，保证国家经济任务的完成，除了宣传部门应该积极努力，主动地进行工作外，还必须有党委的统一领导，行政干部的积极参加和支持，和工会、青年团的积极配合，把各方面的力量动员起来，在极广大的规模上开展宣传工作，发挥宣传工作的极大威力。
    但是，要在一个中心任务中，动员全党做宣传工作，必须有一系列的组织工作和深入的思想准备过程。否则，所谓全党做宣传工作，便会落空。这种组织工作和思想准备工作，在目前情况下，主要是两个方面：一方面是发动党、行政、工会、青年团各级干部和各级组织进行宣传工作；另一方面则是在每一运动中，有意识地使用宣传网，和经常提高报告员和宣传员的水平。在这两方面，有些厂矿已获得了一些比较好的经验。如上面所指的某些厂矿，他们在每一个中心任务中，从厂级干部直到车间一级干部（包括宣传员），都经过充分酝酿，明确了当前的关键问题，掌握了各种思想情况，确定了宣传的主要内容。这种思想酝酿过程，同时也是组织宣传力量的过程，动员全党做宣传工作的过程。经过这个准备之后，号令一下，就可以“千军万马”地展开宣传工作，其声势之大是异乎寻常的。如某厂第五车间，在展开大规模的宣传中，集中使用了车间所有的宣传工具和宣传力量都统一宣传党的支部所规定的内容。每个党员、团员都做出计划，保证向一定对象进行宣传。支部随时根据这些计划检查工作。全车间的宣传员都按每个人的特长和工作岗位，实行“包干制”的宣传。动员了工长、组长、职员、技师向工人做宣传。车间内所有的黑板报、读报组、漫画、图表以及一切会议，都以既定的内容为宣传中心。这样，可以在车间内造成一种强烈的气氛，使工人所见所闻都是这件事。这种宣传，对工人的感染力很强，宣传的效果也比较突出。其次，应该经常注意使用宣传网和培养宣传员。东北化学制药厂的党委十分重视宣传网，大大发挥了宣传员的作用。上半年经常起作用的宣传员，仅占百分之二十一点五，不经常起作用的占百分之六十六点六，完全不起作用的占百分之十一点八。下半年的情况完全不同了。经常起作用的上升到百分之五十四点八，不经常起作用的降到百分之四十五点二，完全不起作用的，已经没有了。他们领导宣传网的经验，主要是：第一、党委重视。党委把宣传网看成是自己实现思想领导的重要工具，并把这种观点一直贯彻到车间。他们找到两个不同典型（一个是重视宣传网的，另一个是不重视宣传网的），在车间干部中展开讨论，提高干部对宣传网的认识；第二、实行宣传员日记制，经常检查和帮助宣传员的工作；第三、使宣传员和群众见面（在群众中公布），为宣传员准备在群众中活动的条件；第四、开好由支部书记主持的宣传员会议。又如，抚顺露天矿东采煤段的领导干部，建立了比较健全的领导宣传网的制度。每月召开一次宣传员大会，总结和布置工作；召开三次小组长联席会议，研究和检查工作，每周举行一次小组会，汇报工作和反映情况。另外，每早七至八时，固定为宣传员学习时间。每个宣传员都有具体分工，固定了宣传地区和对象，因此，宣传活动就很经常。其次，报告员和宣传员配合的比较紧密。党总支的报告员每月向宣传员作三次报告，具体交代每个时期的工作任务，指示宣传员工作的方针、目的和步骤，帮助分析群众思想，解决工作疑难，指导工作方法。宣传员则负责反映生产情况、群众的思想动向和要求。由于报告员和宣传员在工作上的密切结合，党总支掌握情况、发现和解决问题比较及时；宣传员因有报告员的帮助，许多困难都得到了解决。因此，我们认为，如果党的领导干部能经常注意使用各方面的力量，进行大规模的宣传，使党、行政、工会、青年团从各个方面配合起来，同时又能经常培养和使用宣传网，那么，全党作宣传工作的要求便一定能够实现，而党的宣传工作也必定会出现新的局面。　（未完）
