Xinhua News Agency, December 19th—The United States' stubborn attitude of insisting on unreasonable demands and delaying the conclusion of an agreement in the Korean armistice negotiations has aroused opposition from the broad masses of the British people. Even within the British ruling group, it has caused increasing doubts and dissatisfaction.

As early as November 16, Daniel, the "New York Times" correspondent in London, admitted in a dispatch from London: "The British people are beginning to doubt whether the British government's trust in General Ridgway, commander of the United Nations forces, and his negotiators is appropriate. ...Some suspect that the United States wants to prolong the war for some ulterior motive." Daniel also said: "Whether in Parliament or in the newspapers, there are more and more signs that the British people are feeling anxious because the negotiations have not been able to achieve a ceasefire in Korea. They solemnly ask: Is this due to the United States' unwillingness to reconcile, or the Communists' unwillingness to reconcile?" According to Daniel, "The people who raise such questions are not limited to the left-wing pacifist groups within the Labor Party who always say that the United States has ulterior motives... Even Conservatives are beginning to feel distressed by this issue."

As the US negotiators continued to delay day after day in the Panmunjom negotiations, British suspicion of the United States has greatly increased. A month ago, according to Daniel, "Labor members in the British Parliament have repeatedly suggested that a British representative or a Commonwealth representative should participate in the negotiating committee. Recently, it has been suggested that while the ceasefire negotiations are still in progress, the British government should not allow its troops in Korea to engage in any offensive combat other than defensive combat." Now the dissatisfaction in the British Parliament is even more obvious. According to a French Press Agency (AFP) dispatch from London on December 11: "In the past few days, Foreign Secretary Eden has had to appease the anger of several members of parliament. ...The closer the deadline of December 27 approaches, the more impatient these politicians become."

Even the British authorities have begun to subtly complain about the US's arbitrary actions in the Korean negotiations. AFP said: "London officials said on the evening of the 11th that they did not know more about the situation of the Korean armistice negotiations than journalists. Behind these words, a certain agitation can be felt." AFP then said: "The fact is: the British government has not been able to make the public and themselves jointly trust the US commander. Therefore, British officials have to consider the domestic uneasiness about the Korean issue." Not only that, "The public does not have much trust in the methods used by the delegation attending the United Nations, the principles on which it conducts its debates, and even the war aims of the Western governments." On the same day, the British bourgeois newspaper "Manchester Guardian" published an editorial, expressing dissatisfaction with the US representatives' deliberate refusal to accept our fair and reasonable proposals in the Panmunjom negotiations. Referring to the six plans proposed by our representatives on the 14th to resolve the third item on the agenda, the newspaper said:

    "Although technically the Allied forces' inspection plan may be more comprehensive than the Communist side's, the Communist side's plan seems quite reasonable."

According to a special dispatch from Paris by the "Observer's" correspondent in Paris, Belloff, published on December 2, dissatisfaction with the US delaying tactics has not only appeared in the United Kingdom, but has also been reflected among the representatives of many countries attending the United Nations General Assembly in Paris. This situation has alarmed the United States. Belloff said: Anti-American rhetoric "is surprisingly loud and bold in the lounges of the General Assembly. The unpopularity of the Korean War and the feeling that the United States has not done enough to stop the war are the main factors driving the 'neutralist' movement in the United Nations." Belloff said: In this situation, "Americans are anxious to overcome others' suspicions of them - suspicions that they are not interested in peace. This reflects their growing discouragement with the undercurrent of anti-American sentiment among the United Nations representatives."

    美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判
    激起英国广大人民反对  英统治集团也感到苦恼
    【新华社十九日讯】美国方面在朝鲜停战谈判中坚持无理要求、延不达成协议的顽固态度，已经激起英国广大人民的反对。甚至在英国统治集团内部也已引起了日益增加的疑虑和不满。
    美国“纽约时报”驻伦敦特派记者但尼尔早在十一月十六日从伦敦发出的电讯中即已承认：“英国人民已在开始怀疑英国政府对联合国军总司令李奇微将军和他的谈判代表的信任是否适当。……有人怀疑美国为了某种不可告人的理由，希望延长战争。”但尼尔又说：“无论在议会中或者报纸上，都可以看到有愈来愈多的迹象表明，由于谈判没有能够在朝鲜促成停火令，英国人民感到焦躁不安。他们郑重地发问：这究竟应当怪美国不肯和解，还是怪共产党不肯和解？”据但尼尔说：“提出这样一种问题的，已不限于老是说美国有卑鄙动机的工党内部左翼非战主义集团……甚至连保守党人也开始因为这个问题而感到苦恼了。”
    随着美国谈判代表在板门店谈判中日复一日的拖延，英国方面对美国的怀疑已经大大增长。一个月以前，据但尼尔透露，英国国会中的“工党党员有好几次认为应当有一个英国代表或联邦代表参加谈判委员会。最近有人建议，在停火谈判仍在进行的时候，英国政府应当不让它在朝鲜的部队进行防御战斗以外的任何攻势战斗。”现在英国国会中的不满是更加明显了。据法新社伦敦十二月十一日电透露：“在过去几天里，外交大臣艾登不得不平息若干议员的火气。……十二月二十七日的最后期限越接近，这些政界人士就越等得不耐烦。”
    甚至英国官方都已在开始含蓄地抱怨美国在朝鲜谈判中的独断专行。法新社说：“伦敦官方人士十一日晚间说，关于朝鲜停战谈判的情况，他们并不比新闻记者知道得更多。在这种话后面，可以感到某种激动情绪。”法新社接着说：“事实是：英国政府方面没有能够使公众和他们共同信任美国的统帅。所以，英国官员就不得不考虑国内对于朝鲜问题的不安情绪。”不仅如此，“公众对于出席联合国的代表团所使用的方法，它进行辩论时所根据的原则，甚至西方各国政府作战的目的都不大信任。”就在同一天，英国资产阶级的“曼彻斯特卫报”发表社论，对美方代表在板门店谈判中故意拒绝接受我方公平合理的主张表示不满，该报在谈到我方代表于十四日提出的解决第三项议程的六项方案时说：
    “虽然在技术上联军的视察方案也许比共方的周全一点，但共方的方案似乎也很够合理了。”
    据英国“观察家报”十二月二日发表的该报驻巴黎特派员贝洛夫的专电透露，对于美方拖延手法的不满不仅已在英国出现，而且也已在出席巴黎联合国大会的许多国家的代表中间反映出来。这种情况已使得美国感到惊慌。贝洛夫说：反美言论“在大会的休息室里响亮和大胆得惊人。朝鲜战争的不得人心，以及觉得美国停止战争的努力做得不够的感觉，是推动联合国中‘中立主义’运动的主要因素。”贝洛夫说：在这种情况下，“美国人焦急地要克服别人对他们的怀疑——怀疑他们是对和平不感兴趣的。这反映出他们对于联合国代表中间反美情绪的暗流，正愈益感到气馁。”
