    Henan Xinyang Prefecture
    Relevant Leaders Should Handle Individual Township Cadres Embezzling Mass Donations
    To the Editor: In the Henan Xinyang Prefecture, during the campaign to increase production and practice economy, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, the behavior of individual township cadres embezzling donations from the masses was discovered. Among them, township cadres in Runan County embezzled more than 10.01 million yuan of donations; township cadres in Zhengyang County embezzled more than 300,000 yuan; and Gao Fengyin, the township head of Wangzhai Township in the Sixth District of Xiping County, embezzled 320,000 yuan alone. In addition, there were also instances of diverting donations for other purposes. For example, Zhang Zhentian, a public security officer from Zhangzhai Township in the Second District of Xincai County, privately used 2 million yuan of donations from the masses for other purposes.
    In order to powerfully support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the people tightened their belts, participated in voluntary labor, and donated the money they saved, but it was pocketed by these lawless elements. This is an intolerable criminal act, and I hope that the relevant leading authorities mentioned above can quickly handle this matter.

    河南信阳专区
    个别乡干部贪污群众捐款有关领导方面应予以处理
    编辑同志：河南省信阳专区在开展增产节约，反对贪污，反对浪费，反对官僚主义运动中，检查出个别乡干部贪污群众献款的行为。其中汝南县乡干部贪污的献款达一千零一十多万元；正阳县乡干部贪污三十多万元；西平县六区王砦乡乡长高奉印一人私吞献款三十二万元。另外，也有挪用献款作其他工作的现象。如新蔡县二区张砦乡公安员张振田，私自把群众献款二百万元用于其他地方。
    为了有力地支援人民志愿军，人民省吃俭用，参加义务劳动，把省下来的钱捐献出来，但却被这些不法分子吞入私囊。这是一种不可容忍的犯罪行为，我希望上述有关领导机关能迅速处理这件事。
