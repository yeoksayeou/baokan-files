    Shanghai Railway Administration Should Not Neglect the Health of Train Attendants
    Editor: The bureaucratic work style of leading cadres at the Shanghai Railway Administration is seriously harming the health of the train attendants at the Nanjing Locomotive Depot. For example, the Liang Lijin locomotive crew worked continuously for thirty hours from 22:57 on November 15th, undertaking three train duties. Workers in the Shao Bingliang and Shen Boguang locomotive group also said: the locomotives needing cleaning had to make two round trips between Nanjing and Shanghai, working continuously for about forty hours. Ji Qingrong, the director of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot, and Da Yingsong, the chairman of the trade union, have reported this situation to the Shanghai Railway Administration in writing, and the Shanghai Railway News has also published critical articles. However, this situation has not been corrected. I hope that the Shanghai Railway Administration will investigate and correct this phenomenon.

    上海铁路管理局不应忽视乘务员健康
    编辑同志：上海铁路管理局领导干部的官僚主义作风，严重地损害了南京机务段行车乘务员的健康。比如，梁立金机车班自十一月十五日二十二时五十七分起，连续工作了三十小时，共担负了三次出车任务。邵炳良和沈波光机车组的工人也说：洗炉的机车第二班曾两次往返南京和上海之间，连续工作约四十小时。南京机务段段长姬庆荣和工会主席达应松曾向上海铁路管理局书面报告了这种情况，上海铁道报也刊登过批评文章。但这种情况，始终没有改正。我希望上海铁路管理局检查纠正这种现象。        邹楚君
