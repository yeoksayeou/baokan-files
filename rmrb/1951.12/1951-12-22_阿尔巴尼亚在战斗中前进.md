    Albania Advances in Battle
         Che Yun
    November 8th of this year marked the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labor Party (The Albanian Communist Party changed its name to the Albanian Labor Party based on a resolution passed at the First Congress of the Albanian Communist Party in 1948 - Editor). I accompanied Comrade Huang Zhen, representative of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to Tirana, the capital of Albania, to attend the Labor Party's celebration conference.
        I. The Heroic People
    The past of the Albanian people was like a pitch-black night. The Albanian people have always lived in endless bitterness and suffering under the shackles of various foreign invaders. But the Albanian nation is heroic and unconquerable. The freedom-loving Albanian people have never ceased their struggle against foreign aggression. In 1939, although Italian fascists forcibly occupied Albanian territory, the Albanian people were not intimidated. They resolutely stood up and launched an armed struggle against the invaders. Since 1941, thanks to the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party, the resistance movement quickly turned into a people's liberation war for Albanian freedom and independence. After a four-year long and cruel war, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the assistance of the heroic Soviet army, finally victoriously achieved national liberation.
    The period of the German and Italian fascist occupation of Albania was a bloody reign of terror. When visiting the exhibition for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Labor Party and the National Liberation Museum, you can see from the pictures: staunch communists and people's fighters being tortured and subjected to heinous punishments in prisons; patriotic people and guerrilla fighters being hanged on the gallows; masses of people being slaughtered by German and Italian fascist bandits; Quislings and puppet troops grinning menacingly at a group of people being shot; houses being set on fire by the enemy, smoke filling the sky, several orphans weeping on nearby mounds, and numerous cities and villages reduced to scorched earth and ruins; more than 40,000 people (more than 3% of the national population) were killed or injured in the war. The terrible disaster that the fascist occupation forces brought to the Albanian people is difficult to describe in words.
    Although the ferocious enemy could destroy towns, damage farms and fields, slaughter people and livestock, they could never thwart the Albanian people's indomitable fighting spirit and confidence in victory. From the pictures and other exhibits, you can see the heroic Albanian people resolutely taking up arms and waging a tenacious struggle against the enemy. After a call from the Party, guerrilla teams sprang up all over the mountains and plains. You can see guerrilla teams marching in snowy mountains and jungles, with workers, farmers, clerks, students, and women among them. The guerrilla teams developed and expanded from a team of 3,000 people to a People's Liberation Army of more than 70,000 people. You can see the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army firing fiercely at the enemy from rooftops, buildings, and barricades, and attacking the enemy's strongholds. The glittering medals and badges symbolize the victories of the People's Liberation Army in countless battles.
    Naturally, the heinous imperialists are extremely unwilling to accept the existence of the young People's Republic of Albania. They have colluded with all the reactionary forces around Albania—the Tito gang, Greek royalist fascists, and bandits and spies fostered by the reactionary Italian and Turkish governments—to harm Albania, attempting to overthrow the Albanian people's regime.
    However, the conspiracies of US and British imperialists to harm the People's Republic of Albania thousands of times have been and will continue to be shamefully defeated. Albania is not isolated; it is a component part of the powerful world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union. The Albanian people, who have a glorious tradition of resolutely resisting foreign aggressors, will, as in the past, stand firmly on the Adriatic coast and hold the banner of freedom and independence even higher.
        II. Tenaciously Engaging in Construction
    Albania was originally a backward, semi-colonial agricultural country. Before liberation, its productive forces were extremely low. Eighty-five percent of the national population was illiterate. The living standards of the working people were the lowest in Europe. It was also the only country in Europe without railways, and there were only one or two highways built by the Italian fascists for strategic purposes. During the war, it suffered another extremely tragic catastrophe: 40 towns and 1,561 villages were destroyed, the limited industrial equipment was also damaged, most of the highways, bridges, and wharves were blown up, and most of the livestock was looted and killed. The total loss exceeded 1.6 billion US dollars. After liberation, because Tito's elements infiltrated the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party and attempted to implement a plan to colonize Albania, the Albanian people were greatly hindered and harmed in their construction work. The Albanian comrades often said: "To know the real beginning of our construction work, it was after the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties published the resolution on the issue of the Yugoslav Communist Party in 1948 and our Party carried out the work of purging counter-revolutionaries."
    Albania's construction began on such a broken foundation and under such heavy obstacles. But the Albanian people did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties and obstacles, but instead threw themselves into the construction undertaking more tenaciously. Let's look at the amazing achievements they have already made:
    In the first half of this year, Albania's industrial production has increased more than threefold compared with the pre-war period. In 1950, the output of Albania's mining industry was 373.4 percent of the pre-war level. The output of the manufacturing industry reached 301 percent of the pre-war level. The country already has three railways with a total length of 145 kilometers. Around November 8th of this year, three major socialist enterprises were also put into operation one after another. The sugar refinery named "November 8th" after the founding date of the Party produces 10,000 tons of sugar annually, which not only fully meets the needs of the country, but can also be exported. The Stalin Textile Factory produces 20 million meters of textiles annually, solving the country's need for cloth. The establishment of the Lenin Hydropower Station has solved the power and water needs of Tirana and its surrounding areas. Many other enterprise projects are also nearing completion.
    In agriculture, the area of cultivated land in 1950 increased by 52.2 percent compared with the pre-war period. The area of industrial crops has expanded tenfold. State farms and agricultural production cooperatives now account for more than 22 percent of the country's cultivated land, and their output is 10 to 25 percent higher than that of individually operated farms. During the two-year plan, a huge agricultural project was completed, draining the Malique Lake marsh, which was often flooded and bred epidemics, and building a canal. This created more than 4,000 hectares of beautiful land and permanently freed more than 4,000 hectares of surrounding land from the disaster of flooding.
    In cultural and educational undertakings, the nationwide campaign to eliminate illiteracy and the network of primary, secondary, and higher education are spreading to every remote corner. The welfare of the working people has also made great progress. The national income in 1950 was 19 times that of the pre-war period.
    Voluntary labor has already become a very common expression of the Albanian people's high level of enthusiasm for labor. Albania produces a large amount of olives, and the collection of olives is mostly done by women's voluntary labor teams. The three railways, totaling 145 kilometers in length, were all built by 63,000 young men and women through voluntary labor.
    In the cause of building their motherland, the Albanian people have shown selfless enthusiasm for labor, and the number of shock workers among the workers is increasing rapidly at an astonishing rate. At the end of 1946, there were only 78 shock workers in the country, but at the end of 1950, there were 6,323. Among workers in the transportation, manufacturing, construction, and agricultural industries, shock workers even reached a proportion of more than half of the total number of workers. It is precisely because of this selfless enthusiasm for labor and the tenacity to overcome difficulties that the Albanian people have been able to achieve brilliant achievements in their construction undertakings. The infinite power of the victorious people will undoubtedly lead the construction of the new Albania to even more glorious and brilliant victories.
        III. The People Celebrate Their Holiday
    What a day of great historical significance November 8, 1941, is in the hearts of the liberated Albanian people! The people will never forget this day ten years ago, when the Albanian Communist Party was founded in a simple little house in Tirana. For ten years, the Party has created all the prerequisites for the happy future of the people. It has written the most glorious chapter in the history of the Albanian people. The people will not forget the organizers and leaders of all these victories they have achieved—their Party and their beloved leader Enver Hoxha.
    The Albanian people know how to commemorate their holiday with action. As early as April of this year, the workers in various factories and production enterprises and the farmers in various places launched a wave of labor competition to present gifts for November 8th, and put forward guarantees to strive to complete the annual production plan before November 8th. In the days before November 8th, the workers and farmers wrote letters to their Party and leader to report good news. The three major projects of the "November 8th" sugar refinery, the Stalin Textile Factory, and the Lenin Hydropower Station were all completed before November 8th. The Pogradec Canned Candy Factory completed 123 percent of the original plan 26 days ahead of schedule. The farmers in the Kolonjë District completed all the grain handover work three months ahead of the government-stipulated deadline.
    In the days approaching November 8th, the entire city of Tirana was filled with a special atmosphere of joy before the arrival of the holiday. It was as if every day was a holiday. After dusk, young people, girls, and children formed lines of cheers and songs and paraded through the streets. On the eve of the holiday, the Lenin Hydropower Station officially started operating and began transmitting electricity at dusk. The entire city of Tirana became a sea of light due to the addition of 1,800 street lights. Rows of buildings shone with slogans composed of neon lights: "Long Live the Albanian Labor Party!", "Long Live Enver Hoxha!", "Long Live Stalin!" Everyone deeply felt that today was an extraordinary day, it was the anniversary of the October Revolution. And tomorrow was the 10th anniversary of the founding of their own Party. Everyone remembered Stalin and Hoxha with infinite love and gratitude, remembering that these two dear names connected together had brought victory to Albania, and had brought the freedom and independence that had been longed for for centuries.
    At any mass gathering, you could hear the masses cheering "Enver, Enver!" so enthusiastically. At the activist conference celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Party, representatives of workers, farmers, youth, and border guards enthusiastically embraced their leader after reading the congratulatory message. At a reception of more than 1,000 people, outstanding people's representatives frequently raised their glasses to toast their leader. A shock worker named Alasbei drank large glasses of wine, and he said to me with great excitement: "Enver is our dearest relative! You see, I cut off my thumb while working in the factory of the Italian fascists in the past, and the factory fired me because of this. Now I still lack this finger, but I have won the glorious title of shock worker and lead a work team of more than 60 people. All this is thanks to our Enver!"
    The Albanian people not only love their own motherland and leader, but also love our big family of 800 million people united and friendly. They often say: "Although we are small, we belong to the great world peace and democracy camp of 800 million people." At the mass meeting in Tirana, the crowds of people held countless portraits of the leaders of fraternal parties of various countries. When the representatives of fifteen fraternal parties of various countries spoke one by one, the masses very familiarly cheered the names of the leaders of the fraternal parties of various countries in turn. When Comrade Huang Zhen, the representative of our Party, walked in front of the ranks of the masses, when he stepped onto the rostrum and waved to the masses, when he talked about the glorious achievements of our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side on the Korean front to annihilate the enemy... how excited the masses were! They enthusiastically cheered "Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong!" wave after wave, and the sea-like applause could not stop for a long time. At the reception, model workers and mothers of martyrs were very excited and warmly embraced the representative of our Mao Zedong. At the evening party celebrating the October Revolution, the Albanian chorus sang our Chinese songs in Chinese pronunciation in an extremely moving way. As soon as the singing stopped, the entire venue burst into warm applause, and people cheered "Mao—Ze—Dong" repeatedly. This made me excitedly recall that on the day we arrived in Tirana, an Albanian comrade who greeted us said: "When the Albanian people talk about 'China,' they connect it with the word 'our'." All this fully demonstrates how loved our great motherland and Chairman Mao are in our distant brother country.
    In the National Liberation Museum, there is a bottle of soil. This bottle of soil was brought by Comrade Hoxha from Mamaev Kurgan in Stalingrad. When he presented this bottle of soil to the museum, he said: "This soil from Stalingrad is sacred soil to our people. Because the fate of the Albanian people and their future generations is determined on this sacred land." When the people of the whole country celebrated the glorious festival of the 10th anniversary of the founding of their party, the Albanian people deeply understood the profound meaning of their leader's words. Today they understand even more that it is precisely because of the existence of the Soviet Union and precisely because they live in the great Stalin era that they have gained liberation and enjoyed freedom and independence. After liberation, without the large-scale selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the support of fraternal countries, Albania would not only have many difficulties in all aspects of its development; and the freedom won at the cost of great bloodshed and sacrifice in the struggle against the fascist aggressors would also be in great danger. On every occasion of mass gatherings, as long as the speaker mentioned the name of Stalin, the entire venue would immediately erupt with cheers that shook the houses and echoed through the valleys—"Sta—lin!" "Sta—lin!" Storm-like applause continued to boom. When I visited the factory, I encountered workers pointing at the names of Soviet factories on the machines several times in the workshop. Their faces showed infinite happiness and grateful smiles, and they said words that I did not understand, but I clearly heard one word—"Stalin."
    We celebrated their glorious holiday with the Albanian people with joy and excitement. Heroic Albanian people, continue to move forward bravely! I wish you greater and more brilliant victories on the road to building socialism.

    阿尔巴尼亚在战斗中前进
         车澐
    今年十一月八日，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党（一九四八年阿尔巴尼亚共产党第一届代表大会通过决议，将阿尔巴尼亚共产党改名为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党——编者）成立十周年纪念日。我随中共中央代表黄镇同志前往阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那参加了劳动党的庆祝大会。
        一、英勇的人民
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的过去像一个漆黑的夜。阿尔巴尼亚人民始终在不同的外国侵略者的枷锁下过着无限辛酸和苦难的日子。但是阿尔巴尼亚民族是英勇的，是不可征服的。热爱自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民，从来没有停止过反抗异族侵略的斗争。一九三九年，意大利法西斯虽然用武力强占了阿尔巴尼亚的国土，但是阿尔巴尼亚人民并没有被吓倒，他们坚决地挺身而起，向侵略者进行了武装斗争。自一九四一年起，由于有了阿尔巴尼亚共产党的领导，抵抗运动很快地就转而成为争取阿尔巴尼亚自由和独立的人民解放战争。经过四年之久的残酷战争，阿尔巴尼亚人民在共产党领导下，并借助于英勇苏军的援助，而终于胜利地获得了全国的解放。
    德意法西斯军队占领阿尔巴尼亚的期间，是一个血腥的恐怖时期。参观劳动党成立十周年的展览会和民族解放博物馆时，从图片中你可以看到：不屈的共产党人和人民斗士在监狱中遭受着折磨和毒刑，爱国人民和游击战士被绞死在绞架上，群众大批大批地被德意法西斯匪徒屠杀了，吉斯林分子和伪军面对着一批被枪杀的群众而持枪狞笑；房屋被敌人纵火焚烧了，烟雾弥漫着天空，几个孤儿在附近的土邱上号泣，许许多多的城市和乡村化为一片焦土和废墟；四万多人（占全国人口的百分之三以上）在战争中伤亡了。法西斯占领军给阿尔巴尼亚人民带来的惨重灾害，是难以用言语形容的。
    凶残的敌人虽然可以毁灭城镇，破坏农庄和田地，残杀人口和牲畜，但是他们永远挫折不了阿尔巴尼亚人民不屈的斗志和胜利的信心。从图片和其他的展览品中，你可以看到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决地拿起武器和敌人进行顽强的斗争。在党的一个号召发出后，就漫山遍野地出现了游击队。你可以看到游击队在雪山和丛林中行进，游击队中有工人、农民、职员、学生和妇女。游击队从一支三千人的队伍，发展扩大而成为数达七万以上的人民解放军。你可以看到人民解放军的战士在屋顶上，楼房里，街垒边向敌人猛烈射击，向敌人的据点进袭。金光灿烂的奖章和勋章，象征着人民解放军全体指战员无数次战斗的胜利。
    穷凶极恶的帝国主义，对于年轻的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的存在，自然是极不甘心的。他们纠集了阿尔巴尼亚周围的一切反动势力——铁托匪帮、希腊保皇法西斯分子、反动的意大利和土耳其政府豢养的匪徒和间谍等——来危害阿尔巴尼亚，妄图推翻阿尔巴尼亚的人民政权。
    然而，美英帝国主义者千百次危害阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的阴谋，已经遭到而且还要继续遭到可耻的失败。阿尔巴尼亚并不是孤立的，它是以伟大苏联为首的强大世界和平民主阵营中间的一个组成部分。有着坚决抵抗外国侵略者的光荣传统的阿尔巴尼亚人民，一定会像过去一样，坚强地屹立在亚得里亚海畔，将自由和独立的旗帜举得更高。
        二、顽强地进行着建设
    阿尔巴尼亚原是一个落后的半殖民地的农业国。解放以前，生产力极低。全国人口百分之八十五是文盲。劳动人民的生活水平在欧洲各国中是最低的。它又是欧洲唯一没有铁路的国家，公路也只有意大利法西斯为战略目的而修筑的一两条。战争期间又遭受了一次极其惨重的浩劫：四十座城镇和一千五百六十一个乡村被破坏了，仅有的一些工业设备也被破坏了，公路桥梁码头绝大部分被炸毁了，牲畜也大部分被抢走和被杀死了。总计损失在十六亿美元以上。解放以后，由于铁托分子钻入了阿尔巴尼亚共产党的领导机构，力图实行使阿尔巴尼亚殖民地化的计划，致使阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设工作中又受到了莫大的阻碍和危害。阿尔巴尼亚的同志们常说：“要知道我们建设工作的真正开始，还是在
    一九四八年共产党和工人党情报局发表了关于南斯拉夫共产党问题的决议，我们党进行了肃清反革命分子工作之后啊。”
    阿尔巴尼亚的建设，就是在这样破碎不堪的根底上和受着重重阻碍的情况下开创起来的。但是阿尔巴尼亚人民并没有在困难和障碍的面前低头，而是更加顽强地投身在建设事业中。我们且看他们已经取得的惊人的成就吧：
    本年上半年阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产量，同战前相比已经增加了三倍多。一九五○年阿尔巴尼亚采矿工业的产量已为战前水平的百分之三七三·四。制造工业产量已达战前的百分之三○一。全国已有总计一百四十五公里长的三条铁路。今年十一月八日前后，三大社会主义企业也都连续开工了。以党的成立日“十一月八日”命名的炼糖厂年产一万吨糖，这不但足供全国之需，而且还可以输出。斯大林纺织厂年产两千万公尺的纺织品，解决了全国布匹的需要。列宁水电站的建立，解决了地拉那及其附近各地的动力和用水的需要。还有许多其他企业工程也将近完成了。
    在农业方面，一九五○年的耕地面积较之战前已增加了百分之五二·二。工业作物面积扩大了十倍。国营农场和农业生产合作社的土地已占全国耕地的百分之二十二以上，在产量上则比个体经营的农场高百分之十至二十五。两年计划期间曾完成了一件农业方面的巨大工程，把经常泛滥为害而且滋生疫疠的马里克湖沼的积水排泄掉，并且修好了一条运河。这样就出现了四千多公顷的美好的土地，并且使周围的四千多公顷的土地永远免除了泛滥之灾。
    在文化教育事业上，全国消灭文盲的工作和初等、中等、高等学校网正向每一个偏僻角落里伸展。劳动人民福利事业也有了巨大的进展。一九五○年的国民收入已是战前的十九倍了。
    志愿劳动已经是阿尔巴尼亚人民高度劳动热情的非常普遍的表现了。阿尔巴尼亚出产大量的橄榄，而橄榄的采集工作绝大部分是妇女志愿劳动队来完成的。总计一百四十五公里长的三条铁路，全部是志愿劳动的六万三千多名青年男女修建起来的。
    在建设祖国的事业中，阿尔巴尼亚人民表现了忘我的劳动热情，工人中突击队员的数量以惊人的速度飞快地增加着。一九四六年年底全国还只有七十八名突击队员，而一九五○年年底就有六千三百二十三名了。运输业、制造业、建筑业和农业工人中，突击队员甚至达到了占全部工人人数的一半以上的比例。正是由于这种忘我的劳动热忱和顽强地克服困难的毅力，阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设事业中才能取得辉煌的成就。胜利了的人民的无穷力量，无疑地将把新阿尔巴尼亚的建设事业导向更光荣更辉煌的胜利。
        三、人民欢庆自己的节日
    一九四一年十一月八日，在解放了的阿尔巴尼亚人民心中是一个具有多么重大历史意义的日子呵！人民永远不会忘记十年前的这一天，在地拉那一所简陋的小房子里，成立了阿尔巴尼亚共产党。十年来，党为人民幸福的未来创造了一切先决条件。在阿尔巴尼亚人民的历史中写下了最光辉的篇章。人民不会忘怀他们所取得的这一切胜利的组织者和领导者——他们的党和敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民知道怎样用行动来纪念他们的节日。早在今年四月，各个工厂和生产企业中的工人们，各地的农民们就掀起了为十一月八日献礼的劳动竞赛的热潮，纷纷提出争取在十一月八日以前完成全年生产计划的保证。十一月八日前几天，工人们、农民们就都纷纷向他们的党和领袖来信报喜了。“十一月八日”炼糖厂，斯大林纺织厂，列宁水电站三大工程，都在十一月八日以前完工了。波格拉狄斯罐头糖果工厂提前二十六天完成原订计划的百分之一百二十三。柯隆尼亚区的农民较政府规定期限提前三个月全部完成了缴粮工作。
    临近十一月八日的这几天，地拉那全城洋溢着节日到来之前的一种特有的欢乐气氛。好像每天都在过着节日一样。傍晚以后，青年们，少女们，儿童们组成欢呼、歌唱的行列穿行于街道上。节日前夕，列宁水电站正式开工，黄昏时候开始送电了。地拉那全城由于增加了一千八百盏街灯而成了光亮的海。一排排的楼房上闪耀着霓虹灯组成的口号： “阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”，“恩维尔·霍查万岁！”，“斯大林万岁！”每个人都深深地感觉到今天是一个非同寻常的日子，是十月革命节。而明天又是自己的党的成立十周年纪念日。每一个人都以无限的热爱和感激的心情想起了斯大林和霍查，想起了这两个连在一起的亲爱的名字给阿尔巴尼亚带来了胜利，带来了多少世纪以来所长久缅怀的自由和独立。
    在任何群众集会上都可以听到群众那样热烈地连声欢呼着“恩维尔，恩维尔！”在庆祝党成立十周年的积极分子大会上，工人、农民、青年、边防军的代表，在兴奋地读了祝辞之后，就和他们的领袖热情地吻抱。在一千多人的招待会上，优秀的人民代表们，都频频举杯向他们的领袖敬酒。一位名叫阿拉斯贝的名突击队员大杯大杯地喝着酒，他万分激动地和我说：“恩维尔是我们最亲的亲人呵！你看，我过去在意大利法西斯的工厂里干活把大拇指切掉了，工厂就因此把我开除了。现在我仍然缺着这个指头，可是我已经获得了突击队员的光荣的称号，带领着六十多人的工作队。这一切都是由于我们的恩维尔呵！”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民不但热爱自己的祖国和领袖，而且热爱着我们八万万团结友爱的大家庭。他们经常说：“我们虽然小，但我们是属于八万万的伟大的世界和平民主阵营的。”在地拉那的群众大会上，人山人海的群众们，举着数不清的各国兄弟党的领袖像。当十五个各国兄弟党的代表一一讲话时，群众们就非常熟悉地依次欢呼着各国兄弟党的领袖的名字。当我们党的代表黄镇同志从群众的行列面前走过时，当他登上主席台向群众招手时，当他讲到我们的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩在朝鲜前线歼灭敌人的辉煌战绩时……群众是多么兴奋呵！他们
    一阵又一阵地热烈欢呼着“毛泽东！”“毛泽东！”海潮似的掌声好久好久也不能止息。在招待会上，工农模范们，烈士的母亲们曾十分激动地和我们毛泽东的代表热烈的吻抱。在庆祝十月革命节的晚会上，阿尔巴尼亚的合唱团极其动人地用中国字音唱着我们中国的歌曲。歌声一止，全场就轰然爆发了热烈的掌声，人们连连欢呼“毛—泽—东”。这使我兴奋地联想起我们到达地拉那的那一天，迎接我们的一位阿尔巴尼亚同志曾说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民讲到‘中国’就和‘我们的’这个词儿连在一起。”这一切都充分地说明了我们伟大的祖国和毛主席在我们远方的兄弟国家那里是怎样地被热爱着。
    在民族解放博物馆中放着一瓶子土。这瓶土是霍查同志从斯大林格勒的玛迈·库尔干山带来的。当他将这瓶土赠给博物馆时曾说：“这从斯大林格勒来的土，对于我们人民是神圣的土。因为阿尔巴尼亚人民以及他们未来的世世代代的命运，都是在这块神圣的土地上决定的。”当全国人民欢庆自己的党成立十周年的光荣节日时，阿尔巴尼亚人民是深深地体会到了他们领袖的这句意味深长的话。今天他们更十分懂得，正是由于苏联的存在，正是由于他们生活在伟大的斯大林时代，他们才获得了解放，享受到自由和独立。解放以后，如果没有伟大苏联大规模的无私的援助和各兄弟国家的支持，那么阿尔巴尼亚不但在各方面的发展上将有很多困难；而且以莫大流血牺牲的代价在反对法西斯侵略者的斗争中所赢得的自由，也会陷于极大的危险。在每一次群众集会的场合，只要讲话人一提到斯大林的名字，全场马上就会爆发出震撼屋宇、响彻山谷的欢呼声——“斯大—林！”“斯大—林！”狂风暴雨似的鼓掌声不断地轰响着。当我参观工厂时，在车间里好几次都遇到工人们给我指着机器上苏联工厂的名字，他们的脸上显出无限幸福和感激的笑容，热情地说着我所不懂的话，但是我清晰地听到了一个字——“斯大林”。
    我们以欢欣鼓舞的心情同阿尔巴尼亚人民在一起庆祝了他们的光荣节日。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，继续向前猛进吧！祝你们在建设社会主义的道路上取得更大更光辉的胜利。
