    Some Landlords in Beijing Arbitrarily Increase Rent – Suggest Relevant Departments Handle it Reasonably
    To the Editor: The Beijing Municipal People's Government promulgated the "Amended Provisional Rules for Private Housing Leasing in Beijing" as early as August 17th this year, which clearly stipulates that the rental amount should be freely negotiated between the landlord and tenant according to the principles of fairness and reasonableness, and should not be excessively high or low. However, a few speculative landlords, only caring about personal interests, violate government decrees and arbitrarily raise rents to unreasonable levels. For example, Chang Jin'ying, the landlord of No. 12 Jia, Qianluoquan Hutong, Fourth District, rented four northern tile-roofed rooms and one small eastern platform room in this courtyard to tenant Yu Lianxi on October 3rd this year, demanding 330 jin of millet per month. These houses have lights but no water, yet the rent is much higher than the general rent. Yu Lianxi had no choice but to rent it painfully because it was not easy to find a house. Tian Shuzhen, the landlord of No. 10 Wenshuguan, Fifth District, rented a small western tile-roofed room in this courtyard to garment worker Gao Caiping, demanding a monthly rent of 90 jin of millet, calculated at the retail price of "Volt Dimeter" brand. Gao Caiping's life was already very hard, and bearing such a high rent made her feel even more distressed. Bao Wenpei, the sub-landlord of No. 35 Fangjiayuan, First District, took advantage of Ding Huimin's urgent need to find a house and transferred five rooms to him, demanding 140,000 yuan per room and illegally collecting half a year's rent in advance. Such excessive rents not only violate the leasing regulations and increase the burden on tenants, but also, if developed, will affect other normal leasing relationships. I suggest that the relevant departments in Beijing Municipality promptly deal with these landlords who seek high profits reasonably and re-determine the rent according to the principles of fairness and reasonableness to solve the difficulties of the tenants.　Ze Hui
    Editor's Note: According to the Land Administration Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, they are dealing with this matter.

    北京某些房东随便提高房租  建议有关部门作合理的处理
    编辑同志：北京市人民政府早在今年八月十七日就公布了“修正北京市私有房屋租赁暂行规则”，其中明确规定房屋租额依公平合理的原则，由主客双方自由议定，不宜过高过低。但是竟有少数投机房东，只顾个人利益，违反政府法令，任意把房租提到不合理的高度。如：第四区前罗圈胡同甲十二号房东常进英把这座院内北瓦房四间、东小平台一间在今年十月三日租给房客于连希，每月索租小米达三百三十斤。这些房子有灯无水，房租却较一般房租高出很多。于连希因为找房不易，只好忍痛租下。第五区文书馆十号房东田树贞，把这座院的西瓦房一小间出租给成衣工人高彩萍，每月索租金达小米九十斤，而且按伏地米零售价计算。高彩萍本来生活很苦，负担这样高的房租，更感觉十分困窘。第一区芳嘉园三十五号二房东鲍文佩乘丁惠民急需找房的时候，匀出五间房子转租给他，每间竟索租金十四万元，并违法预收半年租金。像这样的索取过高房租，不只违反了租赁条例，加重了房客的负担，而且发展下去，将要使其他正常的租赁关系受到影响。我建议北京市有关部门迅速对这些贪图高利的房东作合理的处理，并根据公平合理的原则重订租金，以解决房客的困难。　泽　惠
    编者按：据北京市人民政府地政局说，他们正在处理这件事情。
