    Plays Violating the Marriage Law Should Not Be Performed
    Comrade Editor: The People's Cultural Center of Xixian County, Henan Province, has a seriously irresponsible style in its social publicity and education work. On November 27th, the Zhengyang County People's Troupe came to Xixian to perform "Women's Emancipation." The Cultural Center and the troupe jointly issued playbills in advance, and the masses and cadres thought it must be a good play, so many people went to see it. Coincidentally, the local Democratic Women's Federation was holding a county and district women's work conference, and many female comrades went. Unexpectedly, "Women's Emancipation" depicted content like "being afraid of one's wife, holding up lamps, and holding up bricks," full of errors. When judges were adjudicating marriage problem cases, they even ordered women to stand on men's bodies. The audience was dissatisfied and dispersed in a burst of protest, reflecting that this was a distortion of the Marriage Law and an insult to the People's Court.
    Yu Yongxiang, the person in charge of the Xixian County People's Cultural Center, participated in the first district-level representative meeting of literary and art workers and was elected as a member of the district-level Federation of Literary and Art Workers, yet he allowed such a play to be performed. The responsible comrades of the Cultural Center and the comrades of the troupe should all conduct self-criticism, strengthen their study, and improve their sense of political responsibility.

    Editor's Note: We have also received a letter from Comrade Li Guanzhong, who also criticized this incident. Please have the relevant parties inspect this performance.

    不应当演违反婚姻法的戏
    编辑同志：河南息县人民文化馆对社会宣传教育工作，有严重的不负责任的作风。十一月二十七日，正阳县人民剧团到息县演出“妇女翻身”。事前文化馆和剧团联名出戏报，群众、干部以为一定是好戏，去看的人很多。恰巧当地民主妇女联合会正在召开县区妇女工作会议，女同志去了不少。没想到“妇女翻身”演的是“怕老婆，顶灯，顶砖”的内容，错误百出。法官在判处婚姻问题案件时，竟叫妇女站在男人身上。观众不满意，一轰而散，纷纷反映：这是糟塌了婚姻法，有辱人民法院。
    息县人民文化馆负责同志郁永祥参加过专区首届文艺工作者代表会，并当选为专区文学艺术工作者联合会委员，竟放任这种戏演出。文化馆负责同志和剧团同志们都应该进行检讨，加强学习，提高政治责任心。

    编者按：我们还接到李贯中同志的来信，也批评了这一事件。请有关方面对这次演出加以检查。
