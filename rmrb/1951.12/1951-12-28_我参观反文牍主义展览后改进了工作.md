    I Improved My Work After Visiting the Anti-Bureaucracy Exhibition
    Comrade Editor: After visiting the "Anti-Bureaucracy Official Document Exhibition" held by the central political and legal departments, I made preliminary reforms based on the specific situation of our department. The results of the implementation of this reform have been very effective. I would like to make a brief introduction here for the reference of relevant departments.
    Our method is: First, for general official documents, we switched to using an "Original Document Approval Return Registration Book." The person in charge signs their opinion on the original document and submits it to the superior for approval, extracts the case details and registers them in the book, and then returns the original document to the original unit according to the original number. This eliminates the procedures of drafting, reviewing, copying, proofreading, stamping, etc., making it simple and timely. Checking is both based and quick, and there is no trouble of filing and storage. Second, establish a "Telephone Follow-up Book." In the past, it often took two or three months to get a reply to a document. Sometimes even the original document was forgotten where it was placed. Since the establishment of the "Telephone Follow-up Book," in addition to reminding urgent matters in advance and urging replies within the time limit, general matters are followed up by telephone every seven days. Since its implementation, replies have been reported and returned in a timely manner, overcoming the problems of delay, missed deadlines, and official documents sleeping outside for extended periods. After switching to the new method, work efficiency has increased. The paperwork that used to overwhelm three people can now be handled by two people with time to spare, and a lot of office supplies have been saved.
    Our reform is the result of the inspiration of this anti-bureaucracy exhibition. Therefore, I suggest that governments at all levels universally hold such exhibitions to create a nationwide anti-bureaucracy movement. Wei Wen

    我参观反文牍主义展览后改进了工作
    编辑同志：我参观了中央政法部门举办的“反文牍主义公文展览会”后，根据我们部门的具体情况，作了初步的改革。这种改革实施的结果，很有成效，我特在这里作简单介绍，供有关部门参考。
    我们的办法是：第一，一般公文，改用“原件批回登记簿”。由主办人员在原件上签注意见，呈经上级批准，把案由摘登在簿子上，然后把原件按原号发回原机关。这样，就省掉了拟稿、核稿、缮校、用印等等手续，简便、及时；查对起来，既有底，又快当，还没有归档、保管等的麻烦。第二，建立“电话催复簿”。以前查复一件文件，交下去，常常两三个月没有回音。有时候连原件都忘记放在什么地方了。自从建立了“电话催复簿”，除急件提前提醒，按限催复外，一般的每七日用电话催复一次。施行以来，都能及时查报复出，克服了拖延、误期和公文常期在外睡觉的毛病。改用新办法后，工作效率增高了。从前三个人忙不过来的案牍工作，现在两个人办还有剩余时间，并且节省了不少的办公用品。
    我们的改革，是这次反文牍主义展览会启发的结果。所以，我建议各地政府普遍举办这种展览会，以造成全国性的反文牍主义运动。    魏文
