    More Than 700 Shanghai Literary and Art Workers Participate in Land Reform and Huai River Harnessing Work

    In the past month, more than 700 literary and art workers and young people studying the arts in Shanghai have gone to the countryside in succession to participate in land reform and the Huai River harnessing work. The first group, organized by the East China Military and Political Committee's Culture Department, consisted of more than 600 people, who departed in batches in late October. This included literary and art professors, experts, directors, actors such as Xiang Kun, Ding Shande, Xiong Foxi, Mo Pu, Zhang Mei, Chen Yanqiao, Tang Xiaodan, Qin Yi, etc., and students from specialized schools of music, fine arts, and drama. In late November, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Workers organized another 68 people to participate in the Huai River harnessing work and 88 people to participate in land reform work. This included literary and art experts and directors, actors such as Gu Zhongyi, Yang Cunbin, Qu Baiyin, Wang Renmei, etc., and some Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) workers (such as Pingtan and local opera actors). In addition, more than 60 people participated in the democratic reform work of local factories in Shanghai. This group of literary and art workers' organized participation in land reform, Huai River harnessing, and factory work to experience life and transform their ideology will have a significant impact on the ideological remolding movement in Shanghai's literary and art circles in the future.
