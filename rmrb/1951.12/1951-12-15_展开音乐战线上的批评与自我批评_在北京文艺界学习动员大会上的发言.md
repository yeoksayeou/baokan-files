    Unfold Criticism and Self-Criticism on the Music Front
    ——Speech at the Beijing Literary and Art Circles Study Mobilization Meeting
  　Qu Xixian
    After listening to the reports of the leading comrades and the speeches of several veteran figures in the literary and art circles, I would like to say a few words as a young music worker.
    Since Chairman Mao published "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," new music has had a clear direction. It should be affirmed that our work has been successful in the main aspects. The mass singing movement has developed considerably, and it has played a role in serving the revolutionary war, publicizing policies, cooperating with movements, and carrying out patriotic education in combination with reality. However, these achievements are far from meeting the current needs of the people for musical culture. The masses have opinions about our work. Hundreds of songs are produced every month across the country, but the masses still feel that there are no songs to sing. Among so many film songs, radio music programs, and concert performances, only a very few are truly loved by the masses and truly remembered by the masses. These situations reflect that we have not well implemented Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, and our work is still very poor with many problems. Today, I would like to make a preliminary review of our music work based on some opinions usually exchanged with comrades in the music field. This review is very incomplete and very superficial, and it is only an attempt to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism at the beginning of the literary and art circles' study; therefore, the discussion will focus on the shortcomings in the work, and the achievements in the work will be omitted.
    I would like to talk about the current tendencies among music workers and the leadership of music work:
    The main tendencies among music workers are: detachment from politics, detachment from life, using petty-bourgeois sentiments to replace the sentiments of the working people, neglecting ideology, technocracy, despising national traditions, and blindly worshiping the West. Here are some examples to illustrate:
   (1) The tendency to detach from politics—Even now, some people think that doing music does not require studying politics, that singing is a matter of the vocal cords, playing the piano is a matter of ten fingers, and has nothing to do with politics. In one place, it has even developed to the point where listening to political reports is treated as a public errand, with one representative being pushed out each time to "serve the errand," and the rest automatically "exempted." Have these comrades already graduated in politics? It is also these comrades who, even when the Resist America and Aid Korea movement has already been launched, do not know the difference between North Korea and South Korea, and do not know who Kim Il-sung and Syngman Rhee are. This tendency to detach from politics is also reflected in the disregard for mass songs that are closely combined with politics. They believe that mass songs are too simple, too rough, without harmony, without accompaniment, and without artistic value, which are the things that popularization workers do; as for them, they have to engage in large works and large choruses; as if engaging in mass songs would lower their status.
    (2) The tendency to detach from life—Recently, several composers have been writing the Resist America and Aid Korea opera "Eliminate the Aggressors." Some of these comrades have worked in the army for a long time, and several others, although they have not been to the army in the past, have also experienced life, collected materials, and visited relevant parties; this is correct. However, there is also a comrade who puts life experience aside and creates alone behind closed doors: anyway, war is just rumbling, climbing mountains is always a step-by-step process, paving roads and building bridges is always humming, and missing the motherland is always using a folk tune... This kind of creation method is equivalent to saying: there is no need to experience life, as long as there is a technically omnipotent machine tool, one can close the door and imagine and manufacture notes out of thin air. However, the ears of the masses are the fairest, and musical creations that are detached from life sound wrong and are not moving.
    In the art of singing, formalistic singing that does not start from real life and does not start from content is also a serious problem. For example, when singing about the joy of liberated peasants, the laughter of Chaliapin in the "Song of the Flea" actually appeared. Singing without life is often not intimate; creation without life is often pale; what is worse is that it even distorts the characters and distorts reality.
    Detachment from politics and detachment from life are often two biases that are combined together. People who are detached from politics are bound to be detached from life; or cannot correctly understand life. People who are detached from life often lack political enthusiasm, or make political feelings lose rich and vivid content.
   (3) Using petty-bourgeois feelings to replace the feelings of the working people—There are such problems in creation and performance. Starting from petty-bourgeois tastes to describe the struggle, it is clear that the great Resist America and Aid Korea struggle, which is earth-shattering and full of heroism, is sometimes reflected by our creations on its trivial and affectionate side. For example, the "Flying Tiger Mountain" chorus, at first we all felt it was quite good, and even quite moving. It was also very popular among students when it was performed in Tianjin. This work does have its successes. However, when it was tested among the soldiers, the effect was not the same. Some soldiers were impatient to listen. They said: "You don't sing the praises of so many heroic deeds we have created; you just sing about a trivial matter for a long time." When performing in the Northwest troops, the soldiers were particularly dissatisfied with the singing of the sentence "Three days without dry food" so weakly. The leading comrades said: "It is common for our soldiers to go without food for three days, and they are still vigorous when they go to war even if they go without food for a few more days...." Why can the soldiers hear these problems as soon as they hear them, while we are often easily confused by the formal beauty of music, the so-called harmonic effect, chorus effect, drama, and other external phenomena and cannot penetrate into its essence? This shows that we still have very strong petty-bourgeois feelings and incorrect artistic tastes of the petty-bourgeoisie.
    (4) Neglecting ideology, technocracy—In a certain group, there was such a thing: someone said to comrades who emphasized that music creation should have ideology: "I don't talk about ideology with you, if you want to talk, come and talk about technology." He even said arrogantly: "Forget it, you should learn the ABCs of harmony before you come and talk to me." This view of neglecting ideology and technocracy is also quite common among vocal workers. What is more serious is among instrumental performers. I will not give examples here.
    (5) Despising national traditions, blindly worshiping the West—How to treat the classics and traditions, there are still incorrect attitudes in the music field. Although there are biases in various departments, it should be pointed out that the more serious one is despising the traditions of one's own nation and blindly worshiping the West. For example, some vocal workers believe that storytelling music like the drum is not music, but speaking; it is a low-level art, so they demand that the words and sentences be clearly explained. As for their singing, it is "high art," and it doesn't matter if the words and sentences are not clear, as long as the voice is "beautiful" enough. Another saying vulgarizes the national style in singing to "just grasping the articulation." In creation, some people reduce the creation of national style music language to the problem of mastering a few folk song forms, as if being able to write "folk song style" tunes, regardless of whether it can express the feelings of the people today, is called "national style." In short, in the eyes of these comrades, even if there are still things to learn from the inherent musical art of our nation, it is very simple and easy to solve. Therefore, they do not bother to seriously learn from the rich folk music and national heritage.
    Despising the traditions of one's own nation is often combined with the tendency to blindly worship the West. This view is particularly popular among professors. At a piano graduate's recital, even all the programs were Western works, without a single Chinese work.
    This tendency is also often combined with purely technical views. They believe that China has no music at all, and the new music since Nie Er has no value because of its "low technology." In singing, they also believe that traditional singing has no technique. Only Western music has technique. Therefore, those who advocate technocracy are also those who advocate Western music.
    However, the vast people who grow up on the land of the motherland have a flesh-and-blood relationship with their own artistic traditions; and our people have a high culture, and our people are politically awakened, advanced people who are proud of their motherland, and they are good at distinguishing the true good and bad of art. Ignoring the traditions and ignoring the people can only lead to one consequence: that is, the people's indifference to us. Not respecting what the people like will not get the people's love.
    The above talked about the various tendencies in the music field, and below I will talk about some problems in the leadership.
    Do we have leadership? We should have it. The All-China Musicians Association should be a leading institution, and "People's Music" should be a publication responsible for the ideological leadership of the music movement. But in fact, there is a serious phenomenon of drift lacking leadership:
    (1) No ideological leadership—The various tendencies mentioned above are all harmful to the work, but the leadership has not launched a frontal struggle against these erroneous views. Although it has been mentioned in some articles to some extent, there has not been a planned and led serious ideological struggle against these tendencies.
    The All-China Musicians Association has done some work through "People's Music." But if we demand it to the height of ideological leadership, we have not seen a few powerful editorials. No weighty opinions have been expressed on some of the most important issues. The debate between the "earthy voice" and the "foreign voice" is just a collection of opinions from all sides, without a summary or an introduction. Some readers wrote to ask: What is right and what is wrong? Some people even said: "The more I read, the more confused I become!" It is good to have discussions, but discussing without a conclusion can be said to be too objectivist leadership.
   (2) Bureaucratism in leadership style—The All-China Musicians Association often adopts the method of issuing forms and asking for figures to lead the local music associations and important music groups. As for what difficulties they have in their work, they rarely consult them, let alone help them solve problems.
   (3) There is no clear policy in music education, and the training of cadres lacks a certain purpose—In addition to the Central Conservatory of Music, there are also music departments in normal universities, art colleges, and general universities across the country. It is not clear how these colleges and departments should divide their work and how they should cooperate with each other. There are four music education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin, and the curriculum content is similar. Now, colleges and universities across the country are making appropriate adjustments, some are merging, and some are developing specialized areas. However, music education is still decentralized and each does its own thing. In terms of the exchange of teaching experience, there is little contact even between the two most important music education institutions, the Tianjin Central Conservatory of Music and the Shanghai branch. The curriculum reform work has not been done well enough. In terms of literary style, blindly worshiping the West and purely technical views are still quite popular. Many students who study composition still look down on mass songs. In terms of the school system, it is unreasonable to keep students with poor grades in the three-year class to do education work in the future, and those with good grades study for five years to become experts, and the so-called good or bad grades depend on whether the technical courses are good or not; therefore, it further promotes the tendency among students to worship technology and despise mass work and education work.
    (4) No criticism and self-criticism has been launched—The music field is outwardly harmonious, but in literary and artistic thought, ten people have ten ideas. Serious criticisms have not been launched on important creations. Comrade Li Bozhao also mentioned just now: everyone has opinions on Mr. Ma Sicong's works, but no discussions have been launched. Such an important opera creation as "The Long March" is just "informally discussed" and a record is published in "People's Music," supplemented by a written discussion. Even in informal discussions, the attitude is not sincere enough. They don't say it in person, but they talk nonsense behind their backs. As a result, literary and artistic thought cannot be unified, and solidarity work cannot be truly done well. The various erroneous tendencies mentioned above have also damaged the work because no criticism has been launched, and at the same time, those comrades who hold erroneous views cannot be corrected in time. Therefore, they have blocked their own path forward.
    The various situations mentioned above tend to explain the tendencies and problems existing in music work from the phenomenon. As for how to further explore its ideological roots, how to correct biases, and solve problems, it remains to be discussed in this study movement. I believe that as long as we can grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and adhere to Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art, we will surely advance victoriously.

    展开音乐战线上的批评与自我批评
    ——在北京文艺界学习动员大会上的发言
  　瞿希贤
    刚才听到了领导同志们的报告和几位文艺界老前辈的发言，现在我以一个年轻的音乐工作者的身份也来说几句话。
    自从毛主席发表了“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”之后，新音乐已有了个明确的方向。应该肯定：我们的工作在主要方面是有成就的。群众歌咏运动已经有了相当大的发展，结合着现实，在服务于革命战争、宣传政策、配合运动、进行爱国主义教育等等方面都起过一些作用。但是这些成就还远不能和目前人民对音乐文化的需要相适应。群众对我们的工作是有意见的。现在全国各地每月生产几百首歌曲，可是群众还觉得没有歌唱。那么多的电影歌曲、广播音乐节目和音乐会的演出，真正为群众所喜爱的、真正为群众挂在嘴上记在心头的只是极少数。这些情况反映出我们没有很好地执行毛主席的文艺方针，工作还做得很差，问题还很多。今天我想根据平常和音乐界同志们交换的一些意见来对我们音乐工作做一个初步的检讨。这个检讨是很不全面、很不深刻的，只是想在文艺界学习的开始尝试运用批评与自我批评的武器；因此，所谈的将偏重在工作上的缺点，至于工作上的成绩就略去不谈了。
    我想从目前存在于音乐工作者之间的倾向与音乐工作的领导这两方面来谈：
    存在于音乐工作者之间的倾向，主要的是：脱离政治、脱离生活、用小资产阶级的感情来代替劳动人民的感情、忽视思想性、技术至上、轻视民族传统、盲目崇拜西洋。下面举些实例来说明：
   （一）脱离政治的倾向——直到现在还有人以为搞音乐可以不学政治，以为唱歌是声带的事，弹琴是十个手指的事，与政治无关。在某处竟发展到把听政治报告当作派公差来处理，每次推一代表去“应差”，其余的人就自动“免役”了。是不是这些同志在政治上已经毕业了呢？也正是这些同志，甚至在抗美援朝运动已经开展的时候还不知道北朝鲜与南朝鲜有什么分别，也不知道金日成与李承晚是谁。这种脱离政治的倾向也表现在轻视密切结合政治的群众歌曲方面，他们认为群众歌曲太简单、太粗糙、没有和声、没有伴奏、没有艺术价值，是普及工作者做的事；至于他们呢，非得搞大作品、大合唱不可；似乎搞群众歌曲会降低身份似的。
    （二）脱离生活的倾向——最近有好几位作曲者在写抗美援朝歌剧“消灭侵略者”。其中有些同志曾长期在部队工作，也有几位虽然过去未下过部队，这次也去体验了生活、搜集了材料、访问了有关方面；这是正确的。可是也有一位同志把生活体验撇在一边，独自关门创造：反正战争就是轰隆隆，爬山来个一步一停顿，铺路修桥总是这么哼呀嗨，想念祖国就用上个民歌小调……这样的创作方法无异说：不需去体验生活，只要有了一架技术万能的工作母机，就能关起门来凭空想像地制造音符。可是群众的耳朵是最公正的，脱离生活的音乐创作听上去就是不对劲，就是不动人。
    在演唱艺术上，不从实生活出发，不从内容出发的形式主义的演唱，也是个严重的问题，譬如说，在歌唱翻身农民的欢乐时居然出现了夏里亚宾在“跳蚤歌”中的笑声。没有生活的歌唱，时常是不亲切的；没有生活的创作，时常是苍白的；更坏的是甚至歪曲了人物、歪曲了现实。
    脱离政治与脱离生活，常是结合在一起的两种偏向。脱离政治的人，必然脱离生活；或不能正确地理解生活。脱离生活的人也时常缺乏政治上的热情，或是使政治感情失去了丰富生动的内容。
   （三）用小资产阶级的感情代替了劳动人民的感情——在创作上演奏上都有这样的问题。从小资产阶级的趣味出发来描写斗争，明明是惊天动地的充满着英雄气概的伟大的抗美援朝斗争，我们的创作有时却反映了它琐细的、温情的一面。譬如说“飞虎山”大合唱，起先我们听了都觉得相当好，甚至相当受感动。在天津演出时也很受学生的欢迎。这作品的确是有它成功之处。但是拿到战士中去一考验，效果却不大相同，有些战士听得不大耐烦。他们说：“我们创造了那么多的英雄事迹你们都不歌颂；就是拿屁大点事来唱了半天。”在西北部队中演出时，战士们特别对“三天没有吃干粮”一句演唱得如此软弱无力表示不满。领导同志说：“我们的战士三天不吃饭是常有的事，再多几天不吃饭也还是生龙活虎地去作战……。”为什么这些毛病战士们一听就听出来了，而我们就往往容易为音乐的形式美，所谓和声效果、合唱效果、戏剧性等等外在的现象所迷惑而不能深入其本质？这表示我们还有很浓的小资产阶级感情和小资产阶级的不正确的艺术趣味。
    （四）忽视思想性，技术至上——在某团体有过这样的事：有人对强调音乐创作要有思想性的同志说：“我不和你谈思想，要谈就来谈技术。”甚至于嚣张地说：“算了吧，你先把和声学的ABC念会了再来和我谈吧。”这种忽视思想性，技术至上的观点在声乐工作者中，也相当普遍存在。更严重的是在表现器乐演奏者中间。这里就不再一一举例了。
    （五）轻视民族传统，盲目崇拜西洋——如何对待古典、对待传统，音乐界还存在着不正确的态度。虽然在各部门各有所偏，但是应该指出，较严重的是轻视自己民族的传统和盲目崇拜西洋。比如有些声乐工作者认为说唱音乐像大鼓之类不是音乐，是说话；是一种低级的艺术，所以要求把字句交代清楚。至于他们的歌唱则是“高级艺术”，字句听不大清楚没有关系，只要声音“优美”就够了。另一种说法则又把演唱上的民族风格，庸俗化到“只要掌握住咬字就行了”。在创作上则有人把民族风格音乐语言的创造问题降低到掌握几首民歌形式的问题，好像能写“民歌风”的曲调，不管它能不能表现今天人民的感情，就叫做“民族风格”了。总而言之，在这些同志看来，即使我们民族固有的音乐艺术中尚有可以学习之处，也是很简单的、很容易解决的。因此就不屑于认真地向丰富的民间音乐和民族遗产学习。
    轻视自己民族的传统，常和盲目崇拜西洋的倾向结合着出现。这种观点特别在教授中相当流行。在某一位钢琴毕业生的演奏会上，甚至全部节目都是西洋作品，连一个中国作品都没有。
    这种倾向也常和纯技术观点结合着出现的。他们认为我们中国根本没有音乐，聂耳以来的新音乐，也因为“技术太低”而没有什么价值。在演唱上也认为传统的唱法毫无技术。只有西洋音乐才有技术。所以技术至上论者同时也是西洋音乐至上论者。
    但是生长在祖国土地上的广大人民和自己的艺术传统有着血肉的关系；而且我们的人民是有高度文化的，我们的人民是政治上觉醒了的、以自己祖国为骄傲的先进人民，他们善于辨别艺术的真正好坏。无视传统、无视人民的倾向只能造成一种后果：就是人民对我们的冷淡。不尊重人民所喜爱的也就得不到人民的喜爱。
    上面谈了音乐界的各种倾向，下面谈谈领导上的一些问题。
    我们有没有领导呢？应该是有的。中华全国音乐工作者协会就应该是个领导机构，“人民音乐”就应该是负起音乐运动思想领导责任的刊物。但是事实上却存在着严重的缺少领导的自流现象：
    （一）没有思想领导——前面所讲的各种倾向都是对工作有害的，但是领导上没有对这些错误观点展开正面的斗争。虽然在有些文章里也多少提过一下，但是尚未有计划有领导地对这些倾向作严肃的思想斗争。
    中华全国音乐工作者协会通过“人民音乐”是做了一些工作的。但是提到思想领导的高度来要求的话，我们还没有看到几篇有力的社论。对于一些最重要的问题都还没有发表过有分量的意见。对于土嗓子和洋嗓子的论争只是把各方面的意见排列在一起，既没有个总结也没有个介绍。有些读者来信问道：到底什么是对的，什么是错的呢？甚至有人说：“我愈看愈糊涂了！”展开讨论是好的，但是讨论而无结论真可以说是太客观主义的领导了。
   （二）领导方式上的事务主义——全国音协对各地音协和各重要音乐团体的领导常采用发表格、要数字的方式。至于它们在工作上有些什么困难却很少顾问，更不要说帮助他们解决问题了。
   （三）在音乐教育上没有明确的方针，培养干部缺乏一定的目的性——全国除中央音乐学院外，尚有师范大学，文艺学院及一般大学的音乐系。这些院系如何分工、如何互相配合，都不明确。京津两地就有四个音乐教育机构，课程内容大同小异。现在全国的高等学校已经在作适当的调整，有的合并，有的专门发展。可是在音乐教育上还是分散的和各自为政的。在教学经验的交流方面，就在天津中央音乐学院与上海分院这两个最重要的音乐教育机构之间也很少联系。课程改革工作做得很不够。文艺作风方面盲目崇拜西洋和纯技术观点还相当流行。学作曲的同学中还有很多看轻群众歌曲。在学制上，不合理地把功课不好的同学留在三年制班上，将来做教育工作，功课好的读五年制做专家，而所谓功课好不好就是技术课好不好；因此更助长了同学中崇拜技术，轻视群众工作、教育工作的倾向。
    （四）没有展开批评与自我批评——音乐界表面上是一团和气，在文艺思想上却十个人有十个想法。对重要的创作没有展开过认真的批评。刚才李伯钊同志也提到：大家对马思聪先生的作品有意见，但是并没有展开讨论。就像“长征”那样重要的歌剧创作也只是“漫谈”一下，在“人民音乐”上发表个记录，补上个笔谈就算完事了。就是在漫谈的时候态度也不够诚恳。当面不说，背后乱说。结果是文艺思想既不能统一，团结工作就不能真正做好。前面所讲的种种错误倾向也因为没有展开批评而使工作受到了损害，同时也使那些抱着错误观点的同志们不能及时得到纠正。因此堵塞了自己前进的道路。
    以上所举各种情况偏于从现象上来说明音乐工作中存在的倾向和问题。至于如何更深入地挖掘其思想根源、如何纠正偏向、解决问题，还有待于在这次学习运动中展开讨论。我相信：只要我们能掌握住批评与自我批评的武器，坚持毛主席的文艺方向，我们一定能胜利前进。（原载文艺报第五卷第四期）
