    My Thoughts on the Yu Mingchuan Incident

    The Yu Mingchuan incident is an event concerning the ideological problems of each and every one of us. It is a major ideological lesson for me. I have fully realized that this is a ruthless struggle against enemy ideology. We should not think that we can stand firm just because we have not shielded counter-revolutionaries. The important question is whether we can withstand the test when encountering similar situations, and whether we will also stand on the side of the people's enemy. This is the fundamental reason why we intellectuals who are not of worker-peasant origin must undergo thorough ideological remolding.

    我对俞铭传事件的感想
    俞铭传事件是关乎我们每一个人的思想问题的事件。他对我是一堂思想的大课。我已完全认识到这是一场对敌人思想的无情斗争。我们不要以为自己没有包庇过反革命分子而觉得能站稳立场，重要的问题是在于当遇到同一类事情时，我们能不能经得住考验，会不会也站到反人民的立场上去。这是我们这一班非工农出身的知识分子之所以必须进行彻底思想改造的基本原因。
