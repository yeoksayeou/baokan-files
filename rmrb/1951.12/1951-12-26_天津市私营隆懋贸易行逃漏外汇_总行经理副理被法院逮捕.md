The Tianjin private Longmao Trading Firm has consistently evaded foreign exchange and engaged in black market exchange activities. After investigation and verification, the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution with the Municipal People's Court, and the case is currently under trial.

Longmao Trading Firm is an import and export trading company jointly organized by Lin Kengsheng, Chen Buhe, and Zhang Shulin. The head office is located in Tianjin, with branches in Hong Kong and Qingdao. Since its establishment, this trading firm has consistently engaged in speculation and opportunism. When exporting goods, they underreported the value of the goods, causing residual foreign exchange to flow to Hong Kong. On March 18, 1951, Longmao Trading Firm applied to the North China Trade Administration to export 300 tons of bran, falsely reporting the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price as HK$225 per ton, totaling HK$67,500. The North China Trade Administration and Tianjin Customs, considering the price to be too low, ordered them to provide a guarantee, releasing the goods only after confirming the accuracy of the price. Later, after inspection by the Guangzhou Trade Administration, the actual selling price of this bran was HK$93,048, resulting in an evasion of HK$25,548. Longmao Trading Firm systematically engaged in foreign exchange evasion activities, and had even published a repentance statement for such activities in November 1950.

Longmao Trading Firm also frequently used coded telegrams to purchase black market Hong Kong dollars. For example, on June 22, 1950, the Hong Kong branch of Longmao Trading Firm sent a telegram stating: "Xinhua five four, ○○元补妥. 港窘, 祈配汕糖." (Xinhua five four, ○○ yuan replenished. Hong Kong tight, please allocate Shantou sugar.) Longmao Trading Firm did not conduct any business in Shantou sugar, making this telegram very suspicious. After repeated questioning by the Financial Takeover Office of the Tianjin Military Control Commission, Longmao Trading Firm admitted to the black market exchange activities. The word "sugar" in the telegram was a code word for Hong Kong dollars. The black market Hong Kong dollars purchased by Longmao Trading Firm, as far as has been investigated, amounted to more than HK$513,913. In order to punish illegal merchants, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court has arrested and brought to justice Lin Kengsheng, the general manager of Longmao Trading Firm, and Zhang Boxiang, the deputy manager.

    天津市私营隆懋贸易行逃漏外汇
    总行经理副理被法院逮捕
    天津市私营隆懋贸易行一贯逃漏外汇、捣买黑汇，经调查属实，已由天津市人民检察署向市人民法院提起公诉，现正审理中。
    隆懋贸易行是由林铿生、陈步我和张书林三人共同组织的进出口商行。总行设在天津，香港、青岛设有分行。这个商行自开业以来，一贯投机取巧。在货物出口时，他们少报货价，使余汇逃往香港。一九五一年三月十八日，隆懋贸易行向华北贸易管理局申请出口麸皮三百吨，假报起岸价格每吨港币二百二十五元，共计港币六万七千五百元。华北贸易管理局和天津海关因其价格过低，责令具保保证，报价确实后才予放行。后经广州贸易管理局检查，这
    一项麸皮真实售价共为港币九万三千零四十八元，逃汇港币二万五千五百四十八元。隆懋贸易行有计划地进行逃汇活动，在一九五零年十一月间曾经因为这种活动登报悔过。
    隆懋贸易行又经常用暗语电报购买黑市港汇。如隆懋贸易行香港分行在一九五零年六月二十二日来电称：“新华五四、○○○元补妥。港窘，祈配汕糖。”隆懋贸易行本不做汕糖生意，这个电文很使人疑惑。天津市军事管制委员会金融接管处再三追讯，隆懋贸易行才承认了黑汇的事实，电文中的
    “糖”字就是港汇暗语。隆懋贸易行买得的黑市港汇，只是已经查出的，就有港币五十一万三千九百
    一十三元多。为了惩戒不法商人，天津市人民法院已将隆懋贸易行总行经理林铿生和副理章柏香逮捕归案。天津市人民检察署
