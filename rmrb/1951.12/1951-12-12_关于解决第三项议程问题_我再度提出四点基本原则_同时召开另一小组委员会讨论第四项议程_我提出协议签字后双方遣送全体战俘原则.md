Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th – On the morning of the 11th, our delegation to the Korean armistice talks informed the other side that it agreed to their suggestion to convene another subcommittee to discuss the fourth agenda item concerning the arrangement of prisoners of war. Our representatives attending the subcommittee for the fourth agenda item are General Li Xiangchao and Staff Officer Colonel Chai Chengwen. Our representatives attending the subcommittee for the third agenda item have been changed to General Xie Fang and Staff Officer Zhang Chunshan. During the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item on the 11th, the other side continued to refuse to express its attitude towards our supplementary proposal made on December 3rd, which stated that neither side should introduce any military forces and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea, and that neutral countries should be invited to establish a supervisory body. Our representative reiterated the four basic principles for resolving the third agenda item:

	(1) Non-interference in internal affairs. Neither side has the right to interfere with or inspect the construction of any facilities within Korea.
	(2) The armed forces of both sides should withdraw from the other side's rear and coastal islands and waters within a set time limit in accordance with the existing agreement on the military demarcation line.
	(3) No military forces, weapons or ammunition shall continue to be imported from outside Korea during the armistice period.
	(4) Any necessary inspections of rear ports agreed upon by both sides outside the demilitarized zone must be carried out by a supervisory body composed of neutral countries.

	In the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, our representative proposed the principle of the speedy repatriation of all prisoners of war by both sides after the signing of the armistice agreement. However, the other side also refused to express a clear attitude towards this principle proposed by our side, and claimed that the prisoners of war of both sides should be released in exchange on the basis of so-called fairness and equality, and that one side should not be given so-called unilateral military benefits. Our representative sternly questioned the other side as to whether it was necessary to release some prisoners of war and detain others after the armistice, and demanded that the other side give a positive answer at the meeting on the 12th.

    关于解决第三项议程问题
    我再度提出四点基本原则
    同时召开另一小组委员会讨论第四项议程
    我提出协议签字后双方遣送全体战俘原则
    【新华社开城十一日电】十一日上午朝鲜停战谈判的我方代表团通知对方，同意对方的建议，召开另一小组委员会讨论第四项议程关于俘虏的安排问题。我方出席第四项议程的小组委员会的代表是李相朝将军，参谋柴成文上校。我方出席第三项议程的小组委员会代表改为解方将军与参谋张春山上校。十一日的第三项议程的小组委员会中，对方对我方在十二月三日提出的双方不得从朝鲜境外进入任何军事力量与武器弹药，邀请中立国家成立监察机构的补充建议，继续拒绝表示态度。我方代表再度提出解决第三项议程的四点基本原则：
    （一）不得干涉内政。对于朝鲜境内的一切设备的修建，双方均无权干涉和视察。
    （二）双方武装力量应按照已有的军事分界线的协议，限期撤出对方的后方与沿海岛屿和海面。
    （三）停战期间一切军事力量与武器弹药不得自朝鲜境外继续输入。
    （四）非军事区以外的双方同意的后方口岸的任何必要视察，必须由中立国家所组成的监察机构进行。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表提出双方在停战协议签字后迅速遣送全体战俘的原则。但对方对我方所提的这一原则亦拒绝表示明确的态度，而声称双方俘虏应在所谓公平与平等的基础上进行交换的释放，不应给予一方以所谓片面的军事利益。我方代表严词质问对方是否必须在停战后释放一部分俘虏而扣留另一部分俘虏，并要求对方在十二日的会上给予正面的答复。
