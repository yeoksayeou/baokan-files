　　Commander of British Forces in Korea Complains to British Government
    Dissatisfied with US Delaying Korean Armistice Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 20th] Reuters, London, December 18th: A Reuters reporter has learned that General Bridgeford, Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Forces in Korea, recently wrote a report to the British Minister of Defence. This report describes the sharp decline in the morale of the British Commonwealth forces in Korea and puts forward his suggestions on the attitude that Britain should adopt in future Korean peace negotiations.
    After the two sides in the Korean armistice negotiations reached an agreement on the military demarcation line, the United Nations forces once actually ceased fire, but at that time, Washington ordered a resumption of combat, which caused a situation of nervousness and ideological confusion among the soldiers at the front. Bridgeford believes that the decline in troop morale is related to their nervousness and ideological confusion. Bridgeford said: Soldiers have never been so ideologically confused as they have been during the current armistice negotiations.
    Bridgeford said in his report that the chief representative of the United Nations Command armistice negotiation delegation, Joye, had previously received instructions from the State Department to delay the ceasefire negotiations until the spring of 1952. Bridgeford pointed out that, because of this, the possibility of launching new attacks is expected in the future, which will create new difficulties in resolving the Korean issue.
    Bridgeford said that under these circumstances, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Forces cannot assume the responsibility of maintaining morale and maintaining order at the front if the contradictory orders of the United States continue to cause confusion at the front.
    Bridgeford asked the British Ministry of Defence to take a firmer stand. According to Bridgeford, the British Ministry of Defence has been overly reliant on the Americans in the Korean negotiations in the past. Bridgeford said in the report that, in terms of the loss of materials and personnel, Britain is one of the most important countries participating in the Korean War. He believes that the British government must designate an authoritative plenipotentiary as soon as possible, with the same status as the US representative, to represent the Commonwealth countries in the armistice negotiations.

　　侵朝英军司令向英政府诉苦
    不满美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社二十日讯】电通社伦敦十八日讯：电通社记者获悉，英联邦国家侵朝军队总司令布利治佛德，最近给英国国防大臣写了一个报告。这个报告叙述了在朝鲜的英联邦军队的士气急剧低落的情况，并就英国在今后朝鲜和平谈判中应采取的态度，提出他的建议。
    当朝鲜停战谈判双方在军事分界线问题上取得协议以后，联合国军曾一度实际上停火，但是在那个时候，华盛顿却下令恢复战斗，因而引起了前线士兵们神经紧张和思想混乱的情况。布利治佛德认为军队士气的低落是与他们神经紧张和思想混乱的情况有关系的。布利治佛德说：士兵从来没有象他们在目前的停火谈判期间被人弄得这样思想混乱。
    布利治佛德在他的报告中说：联合国军停战谈判代表团首席代表乔埃前此曾接到国务院的训令，叫他把停火谈判拖延到一九五二年春天。布利治佛德指出：由于这个缘故，预料今后有发动新攻击的可能，那样就会在解决朝鲜问题方面制造新的困难。
    布利治佛德说：在这种情况之下，英联邦军总司令部不能担负保持前线士气和维持秩序的责任，如果美方前后矛盾的命令继续在前线上引起混乱的话。
    布利治佛德要求英国国防部采取较为坚决的立场，据布利治佛德说：在朝鲜谈判中，英国国防部过去是过于信赖美国人了。布利治佛德在报告中说：以物资和人员的损失而论，英国是参加朝鲜战争的最主要的国家之一，他认为，英国政府必须刻不容缓地指定一个有权威的全权代表，具有和美国代表相同的地位，代表英联邦国家参加停战谈判。
