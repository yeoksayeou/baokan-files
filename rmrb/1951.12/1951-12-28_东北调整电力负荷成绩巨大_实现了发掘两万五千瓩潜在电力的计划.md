Northeast China has achieved great success in the comprehensive adjustment of electrical load. As of November 26th, the entire region had realized its plan to tap 25,000 kilowatts of potential power, equivalent to saving the nation electrical equipment investment worth 250,000 tons of grain. The load factor for the entire region has now reached an unprecedented high of 91.4 percent. The daily amount of electricity sold by power plants has increased by 550,000 kilowatt-hours compared to before the load adjustment.

The work of adjusting electrical load has been done better in the Lüda and Anshan areas. Factories in the Lüda area changed intermittently operating machinery to run during the lowest load times and adopted measures such as rotating Sundays off for factory workers, which raised the load factor in November from 71.4 percent in October to 87.8 percent. This allows an average of 8,374 kilowatts of power to be adjusted each month, with a maximum of over 12,000 kilowatts. This is equivalent to saving the nation electrical equipment investment worth more than 100,000 tons of grain. The Anshan Electricity Bureau also adopted the same method, reducing the peak electrical load by 3,000 kilowatts. The local problem of winter power supply difficulties was also resolved as a result.

Currently, the potential power of the Northeast electricity industry has not been fully tapped. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government has decided to continue striving to tap 25,000 kilowatts of power in the future. The methods are: to carry out a campaign to conserve electricity throughout the region, to reduce waste in electric heating, power consumption, and lighting. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北调整电力负荷成绩巨大
    实现了发掘两万五千瓩潜在电力的计划
  东北区全面调整电力负荷已获得巨大成绩。到十一月二十六日止，全区已实现了发掘两万五千瓩潜在电力的计划，等于为国家节约了二十五万吨粮食的电力设备投资。全区的负荷率现已达到百分之九十一点四的空前未有的高度。电厂每日的卖电量已比调整负荷前增多五十五万度。
    东北各地调整电力负荷的工作，以旅大、鞍山两地做得较好。旅大地区各工厂把不连续运转的机械设备改在最低负荷时间开动，并采取星期日工厂工人轮流休息等办法，使十一月份的负荷率由十月份的百分之七十一点四提高到百分之八十七点八。这样平均每月可调整出电力八千三百七十四瓩，最高时可以达到一万二千瓩以上。这就等于给国家节约了等于十多万吨粮食价值的电力设备投资。鞍山电业局也采取同样的办法，使电力最高负荷降低了三千瓩。当地冬季电源困难的问题也因此得到解决。
    目前东北电业的潜在力量还没有完全挖掘出来。东北人民政府工业部决定在今后继续争取挖掘两万五千瓩电力。办法是：在全区开展节约用电运动，以减少电热用电、电力用电和照明用电等方面的浪费现象。（新华社）
