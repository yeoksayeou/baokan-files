Representatives of all circles attending the Third Session of the Third Beijing People's Representative Conference yesterday (30th) during the general discussion, 41 representatives spoke. They all agreed with and endorsed Chairman Peng Zhen's report, and pointed out that the remnants of the rampant corruption prevalent during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, especially the bad habits of some retained personnel, have not only not been eliminated, but are continuing to entice and infect good people. Some young people and even veteran cadres who have recently started working have been dragged into the mire by them. Therefore, they all unanimously praised Chairman Mao's instructions as timely and wise. Everyone believes that launching a large-scale anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is of extreme importance to strengthening the struggle against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and developing national construction.

Public Sector Industrial and Mining Enterprise Worker Representatives Advocate:

	Incorporate Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste into Patriotic Pledges
	
When representatives of public sector industrial and mining enterprises spoke, Zhou Jiahua, Director of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Li Guanglu, Deputy Director of Beijing Railway Sub-bureau, Wang Wenbin, Deputy Director of Shijingshan Power Plant, Li Yan, Director of Beijing Electric Power Bureau, Feng Peizhi, Deputy Director of Jingxi Mining Bureau, Li Yukui, Deputy Director of Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, Qiu Fangyu, Chairman of the Construction Bureau Trade Union, and Li Guorui, Chairman of the Waterworks Trade Union, reported the tremendous achievements of these industrial and mining enterprises in increasing production and practicing economy. The workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have overfulfilled the super-profit plan equivalent to 25 fighter planes this year, and plan to increase production and practice economy by more than 200 billion yuan next year. Beijing Railway Sub-bureau has increased production and practiced economy by 100 billion yuan this year. The cost of coal at Jingxi Mining Bureau has been reduced by more than 7% compared to the plan. On the other hand, the representatives also used specific facts to illustrate the widespread and serious corruption and waste in industrial and mining enterprises. Since liberation, Beijing Railway Sub-bureau has wasted more than 130 billion yuan in basic construction. Shijingshan Power Plant has wasted more than 5 billion yuan due to bureaucracy and poor planning on the part of the leadership. Regarding corruption, 576 people have confessed or been reported at Beijing Railway Sub-bureau, and the amount of embezzled money is about 90 million yuan. The representatives cited many examples to illustrate the criminal behavior of illegal merchants enticing cadres and workers to engage in corruption and threatening them not to confess. Representative Li Yukui said that a corrupt cadre wanted to confess and went to consult with the bribing奸商 (unscrupulous merchant), who actually threatened him with meeting in "阎王殿" (the underworld). The奸商's wife also said: "Don't confess. If you confess, our whole family will suffer." But later this cadre confessed. He said, "If I don't confess, I can't stand it!" The representatives unanimously advocated that anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy should be carried out on a large scale, corrupt elements should be mobilized to confess, the masses should be mobilized to report, and the content of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy should be incorporated into the patriotic pledge.

Peng Zefang, Director of the Central Government Engineering Office, and Zhong Sen, Manager of Beijing Architectural Design Company, spoke, explaining the serious waste in construction projects. They said that many construction departments do not conduct thorough investigations and research before designing, do not carefully check drawings after designing, and do not have sound management systems during construction. Many engineers have "杰作思想" ("masterpiece" mentality), "雇佣观点" ("hired hand" mentality) and are irresponsible to the people, thus causing great waste. The Beijing Construction Bureau sent people to investigate a construction site with relatively little waste and found that the construction cost was wasted by 8.5%. Based on this figure, at least 200 billion yuan or more of the city's construction costs are wasted. China Construction Company lost 30,000 to 40,000 drawing sheets, worth about 200 million yuan, because the owners wanted to change the drawings. Representative Peng Zefang said, "The construction industry has serious problems. It is wasteful and causes deaths. I hope to establish a city-wide management organization to strengthen leadership." Representative Zhong Sen said, "Engineers transforming their thinking, removing the influence of the bourgeoisie, and owners not easily changing drawings are important conditions for eliminating waste in construction projects."

Suburban Farmers Representatives Say:

	Only the People's Government Can Completely Eliminate Corruption
	
When suburban farmer representatives spoke, they all cited many examples to illustrate the necessity of anti-corruption and anti-waste. Zhang Jizong, a member of the Farmers' Association of Dongbeiwang Village in the 13th District, said: Some village cadres are now embezzling public funds and even donations for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, "already having the bad habits of Kuomintang 保长 (village chiefs)." For example, a public security committee member in Diaoyutai Village in the 13th District embezzled 520,000 yuan in donations; Li Xing, a people's representative in Luozhuang Village, embezzled 300,000 yuan in donations to build his own house. These corrupt acts are really hateful, and we should mobilize the masses to report them. Gao Shuzhen, a Farmers' Association group leader in Nangong Village in the 11th District, said: We farmers still have a lot of waste, such as extravagant spending on weddings, funerals, and baby full-month celebrations. When Wang Ruian of Ruihezhuang married his daughter-in-law, he spent all the more than 50 shi (a unit of dry volume) of old corn he had saved since the land reform, leaving his family with no food to eat. A year later, the daughter-in-law divorced his son. Liang Shitong of Yinghaizhuang spent more than 2,000 jin (a unit of weight) of grain on his wedding, and as a result, he couldn't make a living and couldn't repay the bank loan. His brother died of anxiety. Such wasteful phenomena should be opposed. Bai Yushan, Deputy Director of the Farmers' Association of Dajiaoting Village in the 10th District, said: "Such an anti-corruption and anti-waste movement has never happened in history. Only the People's Government led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party would do such a good thing." Regarding the increase in production in suburban rural areas, Zhang Jizong said: Mayor Peng called on us to increase production by 50% to 100% this year, and now we have almost exceeded 100%, and some have exceeded 200%. Next year we must increase production and practice economy better to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Representatives of the Industrial and Commercial Circles Unanimously Express:

	We Must Eliminate Corruption and Bribery
	
The representatives of the industrial and commercial circles unanimously expressed that the industrial and commercial circles must eliminate corruption, bribery, and all bad habits and malpractices. Fu Huating, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: There are many lawless elements in the industrial and commercial circles who harm the public to benefit themselves, bribe and entice working cadres, and harm the interests of the country and the people. Legitimate industrialists and businessmen are very hateful of their illegal behavior. We in the industrial and commercial circles must mobilize as a whole to fight for the complete elimination of corruption and bribery. We have held 1,596 mobilization meetings of various sizes, with 45,268 participants. In the past two days, 26th and 27th, more than 400 people have confessed and reported. However, some industrialists and businessmen do not have a sufficient understanding of this movement. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to carry out widespread and in-depth publicity and mobilization to make it known to every household. All industrialists and businessmen in the city must truthfully and thoroughly confess the facts of corruption and bribery and bravely report them. If the members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the members of the trade associations in various industries are not clean themselves, they should confess first. Ma Lanting, Chairman of the Pastry and Confectionery Industry, said: For the sake of the country's economic construction and the development of legitimate industry and commerce, we in the industrial and commercial circles must encircle and suppress the lawless merchants who offer bribes! Le Songsheng, Deputy Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Liu Yuanjing, Chairman of the Construction Industry, and Chang Zijiu, Chairman of the Grain Industry, further exposed the illegal acts of bribery and buying off staff in the industrial and commercial circles in their speeches. Le Songsheng said: According to the confessions of industrialists and businessmen in various industries in the past few days, bribery and malpractices are widespread. According to people in the radio industry, there are more than 100 members in the industry, and about 80 of them have these phenomena. The first joint group of the knitting industry processed 6,500 dozen sweaters for department stores. According to "regulations": each piece of yarn was exchanged for 103 taels of绒布 (flannel), but in fact, they produced more than these finished products, but they only delivered the goods according to the "regulations". Recently, after the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement was launched, they returned 426 dozen sweaters, worth more than 200 million yuan. Many industrialists and businessmen have also confessed their bad habits and bribery behaviors, and reported the corruption behaviors of some government officials. For example: a certain organization bought goods worth more than 200 million yuan from Lulin Trading Company, and added more than 20 million yuan in "kickbacks"; Chuqi Paper Mill sold 2,500 orders of gray newspaper to a certain organization in December last year, at 138,000 yuan per order, but the invoice was issued at 140,000 yuan per order, and the handlers received a total of 5 million yuan in "kickbacks". Representative Le Songsheng said: "Now, our industrial and commercial circles are actively carrying out this movement, and we hope that all circles in the city, especially our worker friends, will actively help us to completely eliminate corruption, bribery, and bad habits and malpractices." Representative Liu Yuanjing said: The phenomenon of bribery in the construction industry is very common. As a result of bribery, the country's basic construction projects have suffered serious losses. In the past few days, more than 50 construction companies have confessed their bribery behavior. We must work hard to transform our construction industry in this movement. Representative Chang Zijiu said: We in the grain industry have a bad habit, that is, whenever government agencies and organizations come to buy things, they first talk about the base price with the purchasing agent. The shopkeeper always tells the apprentice: "As long as he eats one, we can get at least two." Meaning that his corruption is beneficial to us. After liberation, although we have also met good cadres who refused this set, we have not completely realized the harm of this bad habit to the country and the people. Now I realize that enticing cadres to be corrupt will affect our country's construction. Only by eliminating this shameful bad habit can industry and commerce develop properly. I will definitely convey the spirit of the conference to industrialists and businessmen, so that the industry can eliminate concerns and bravely confess and report the facts of corruption and bribery. Wang Minsheng, Chairman of the New Medicine Industry, pointed out the path of self-renewal for the industrial and commercial circles in his speech. He said: Now some people who have offered bribes have various concerns and are unwilling to confess. This is a big mistake! People from all walks of life have already moved, setting up a net, and it is impossible to侥幸 (seek luck); confessing and admitting mistakes is the way to self-renewal. Wang Chun, Director of the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative, used many facts to illustrate the corrupt behavior of some people who had worked in the Kuomintang military and political organs and the enticement of illegal merchants. He said: The "skills" of the corrupt elements in the cooperative are very high, with more than 20 ways of corruption. They said: "This is the old method used in a new way, with some differences." Originally, corruption was public in the old society, but now it has to be done secretly. At the same time, the collusion of illegal merchants with cadres is even more ingenious. For example, when a cadre in a cooperative货栈 (warehouse) was discussing business with a private merchant, he scratched his back, and the merchant immediately sent medicine to treat the itching; the manager of a certain soap factory saw the deputy director of the district联社 (united cooperative) going to the hospital, and he followed behind to ask what medicine he wanted to buy; if the cadre's bicycle light was not working, he would send a磨电滚子 (dynamo roller); if you are a Hui cadre, he bought snacks and specifically told you that it was halal; he said: "There is no one who can't be hooked by me"! Illegal merchants are so shamelessly enticing cadres. Recently, when cadres wanted to confess their corruption, they even tried to threaten them, saying: "A certain cadre embezzled less, I told him to embezzle a lot, and as a result, the court asked him to undergo labor reform." After a certain shop assistant reported the collusion between the manager and the retail company cadres in corruption and bribery, he received a letter saying: "I want to go in with a white knife and come out with a red knife (a threat of violence)". Director Wang Chun suggested that a city-wide conference should be held to bring these people who resisted the movement to the stage and suppress them! Finally, Director Wang Chun said: After this movement was launched, the masses were very welcome, and the credibility of the cooperative was immediately improved. The wife of the corrupt cadre Lei Hongkang said: "This is great, the government is disciplining him!"

Representatives of Workers in Private Enterprises Speak:

	Resolve to Strengthen Labor-Capital Unity, Increase Production and Practice Economy
	
Liu Zhengzong, Chairman of the New Medicine Industry Trade Union, Gao Fu, Chairman of the Oil, Salt and Grain Industry Trade Union, Gao Jinduo, Vice Chairman of the Iron Industry Trade Union, Cui Haicheng, Vice Chairman of the Construction Trade Union, Shi Yuren, Chairman of the Supplies Repair and Manufacturing Industry Trade Union, Ma Jinghe, Chairman of the Hardware Industry Trade Union, and other worker representatives from private enterprises, pointed out in their speeches that the situation of illegal merchants colluding with cadres, evading taxes, and stealing state property is serious. Representative Liu Zhengzong said: "The hardware industry workers held four forums, and the more than 150 participants reported more than 50 bribery and acceptance cases. New medicine industry workers also reported more than 30 cases at a forum of 40 to 50 people. A capitalist in the hardware industry evaded a large amount of taxes, and after being investigated, he immediately asked someone to 'mediate' and offer bribes. He gave more than 7 million yuan to the 'mediator' alone, and the bribes to the corrupt elements were of course even more." Representative Cui Haicheng said: "The private Dongsheng Construction Company and Haifeng Construction Company used means such as eating out and dancing to entice Zhi Zhenbin, Deputy Manager of the Construction Department of a certain military region, and bribed him tens of millions of yuan to let Zhi sell them the bid price." The representatives explained that some capitalists are still obstructing and undermining this movement. Representative Liu Zhengzong said: "They are evasive in their confessions. Some describe their bribery as cadres borrowing money; some only say that they invited guests to dinner, but do not mention the large amount of bribery; some only say that the cadres are corrupt, but do not say that they steal taxes and steal. Some capitalists also hold forums with workers, wanting to get to the bottom of the workers and block their mouths." Representative Shi Yuren said: "Li Xipeng, manager of Huadong Electric Material Store, repeatedly sold inferior goods to the public at high prices. After the clerk Li Yuan reported it, he found fault and beat Li Yuan. Zhou Xiangpu, manager of Dachina Watch Store, underreported more than 300 million yuan in turnover last year and bribed a cadre with a watch. Fearing that the workers would report it, he tried every means to dismiss the workers. However, no matter how the illegal merchants obstruct and undermine, we workers still have to report boldly." Representative Cui Haicheng said: "Siming Electric Material Store contracted for public projects, colluded with cadres, overreported the number of workers, and wasted materials. The worker Xia Delong reported the capitalists, and the capitalists dismissed him. The government should quickly punish the capitalists according to the law and commend such workers." The representatives pointed out that in the past year, private enterprises have made great achievements in increasing production and practicing economy. However, a small number of capitalists arbitrarily extend working hours, reduce wages, and lower food standards under the pretext of increasing production and practicing economy, which is not in line with the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. The representatives also expressed that they must correct this erroneous behavior of the capitalists, strengthen labor-capital unity, and actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy.

Representatives of the Cultural, Educational, Youth and Women's Circles Express:

	Actively Participate in This Movement to Change Social Mores
	
Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University, Qi Kaizhi, Professor of Beijing Normal University, Wang Youfan, student of Beijing University School of Medicine, Ling Ruiji, student of Tsinghua University, Zheng Yun, representative of primary and secondary school educators, Qiao Yong, student representative, Ding Yannong, school worker representative, and other representatives of teachers, students and staff above the college level all pointed out in their speeches that corruption and waste and bureaucracy also exist in schools. At the same time, they criticized the "清高" ("lofty") thinking that educators "don't manage money, don't manage accounts, and have no corruption to embezzle." Zheng Yun said: Since last year, more than 20 corruption cases have been discovered in primary and secondary schools. Ling Ruiji pointed out that corruption has been found in Tsinghua University Cooperative and Beijing University. The phenomenon of waste is also widespread and serious in schools. Qi Kaizhi said: The waste of time in schools is worth noting. Ling Ruiji said: Tsinghua University has damaged instruments worth more than 20 million yuan in the past six months, and the library has lost more than 1,000 books and magazines. As for the waste of water and electricity and damage to desks and chairs, the phenomenon is common in various schools. Therefore, the representatives unanimously believed that it is necessary to strengthen ideological transformation among teachers and students and vigorously carry out education on "protecting public property" for students. Through this movement, new morals and new mores will be established in schools.

Yang Bozhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, expressed that he would definitely mobilize the youth of the city to actively participate in this movement. He said: Now there are cases of sons reporting their fathers for corruption and young women reporting their husbands for corruption. This movement has also saved many young people. At the same time, after this movement, like getting a vaccination, young people will no longer suffer from the disease of corruption and bribery.

Wang Yaping, Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, representing literary and art and news workers, spoke on behalf of the literary and art circles. He said: The representatives all expressed their willingness to use various literary and artistic forms and news reports to publicize this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

Qian Lingjuan, Deputy Minister of the Women and Children's Welfare Department of the Municipal Women's Federation, Wang Bochao, a military family member who was invited as a representative, and Zhong Luxiang, a regional representative, all expressed in their speeches that they would vigorously publicize and resolutely eliminate corrupt and wasteful elements after returning.

Zhang Jiejie, Secretary-General of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, a women's representative, said: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is closely related to us women. All the women in our city should immediately take active action, mobilize husbands, fathers, sons and daughters who have corrupt behaviors to confess voluntarily. If they resolutely refuse to confess, they should bravely report them to the People's Government. Wang Wanzhen, a staff member of the Beijing Taxation Bureau, a women's representative, said: Since the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement in the Taxation Bureau, more than 900 people have confessed their corruption facts, involving a large number of industrial and commercial households. She hopes that the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles will actively mobilize the industrial and commercial households to bravely confess the facts of bribery to the tax workers after they return, and boldly expose and report the extortion and indebtedness of the tax workers.

    北京各界人民代表会议代表发言
    一致拥护开展反贪污反浪费运动
    北京市第三届第三次各界人民代表会议，昨日（三十日）进行大会讨论时，发言的各界代表共有四十一人，他们一致同意和拥护彭真主席的报告，并指出：国民党反动统治时代猖獗的贪污风气的残余，特别是一部分留用人员的恶习，现在不但没有肃清，而且在继续勾引和传染好人。一部分新参加工作的青年甚至老干部，都被他们拖下了泥坑。因此，他们一致异口同声地称赞毛主席指示的及时和英明。大家认为现在大张旗鼓地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，对于加强抗美援朝斗争和发展国家建设，具有极端重要的意义。公营工矿企业职工代表主张
    把反对贪污浪费订入爱国公约
    公营工矿企业职工代表发言时，石景山钢铁厂厂长周家华、北京铁路分局副局长李光禄、石景山发电厂副厂长王文斌、北京电业局局长李岩、京西矿务局副局长冯佩之、北京电信局副局长李玉奎、建设局工会主席仇方域、自来水公司工会主席李国瑞等，报告了这些工矿企业增产节约的巨大成绩。石景山钢铁厂职工，今年超额完成了相当于二十五架战斗机的超额利润计划，明年计划要增产节约二千亿元以上。北京铁路分局今年增产节约了一千亿元。京西矿务局煤的成本比计划降低了百分之七以上。另一方面，代表们还用具体事实说明工矿企业中存在的普遍而严重的贪污、浪费现象。从解放到现在，北京铁路分局在基本建设方面浪费了十三亿元以上。石景山发电厂因为领导方面的官僚主义和计划不周，曾经浪费了五十亿元以上。关于贪污问题，北京铁路分局现在已经有五百七十六人坦白或被检举，贪污的钱约在九千万元以上。代表们举了很多例子说明不法商人引诱干部、工人来贪污，并威胁他们不许坦白的罪恶行为。李玉奎代表说，一个贪污的干部想坦白，跑去找行贿的奸商商量，那个奸商居然以到“阎王殿”相见来恐吓。奸商的老婆也说：“你可别坦白。你要坦白了，我们一家子都受不了。”可是后来这个干部还是坦白了。他说，“我要不坦白，我也受不了呵！”代表们在发言中一致主张应该大张旗鼓来反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义，动员贪污分子坦白，发动群众检举，并把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的内容订到爱国公约上。
    中直工程处处长彭则放代表和北京市建筑设计公司经理钟森代表发言时，说明了在建筑工程中的严重浪费现象。他们说，很多建筑部门设计前不好好调查研究，设计后不好好检查图样，施工时又没有健全的管理制度，很多工程师有“杰作思想”，雇佣观点，对人民不负责任，因此造成很大浪费。北京市建设局派人到一个浪费比较少的工地去调查，发现建筑费浪费了百分之八点五。按这个数字推算，全市的建筑费浪费掉至少在两千亿元以上，中国建筑公司因为业主们要改变图样，损失了三四万张图样纸，合两亿元左右。彭则放代表说，“建筑业问题严重，既浪费，又死人，希望建立全市性的管理机构，加强领导。”钟森代表说，“工程师们改造思想，去掉资产阶级的影响，业主们也别轻易改变图样，这是消灭建筑工程中浪费的重要条件。”郊区农民代表说
    只有人民政府才能彻底肃清贪污
    郊区农民代表在讲话时，都举了很多例子，说明反贪污、反浪费的必要。第十三区东北旺村农会会员张继宗说：现在有些村干部挪用公款，甚至贪污抗美援朝捐献款，“已经有国民党保长那样的坏习气了”。像第十三区钓鱼台村一个公安委员，贪污捐献款五十二万元；罗皂庄村人民代表李兴挪用捐献款三十万元盖自己的房子。这些贪污行为实在可恶，我们应该发动群众来检举。第十一区南宫村农会小组长高淑珍说：我们农民还有很多浪费的地方，像婚丧嫁娶、小孩满月，就有很多人讲究铺张。瑞和庄王瑞安娶儿媳妇，把土地改革后积攒的五十多石老玉米都花光了，弄得家里没饭吃，一年后，儿媳妇也和儿子离了婚。瀛海庄的梁世同，结婚时花了两千多斤粮食，结果生活没办法，银行的贷款也还不了，他哥哥活活急死了。像这样浪费的现象真是应该反对。第十区大郊亭村农民协会副主任白玉山说：“这样的反贪污、反浪费运动是历史上没有过的事，只有毛主席、共产党领导的人民政府，才会办这样好事。”关于郊区农村的增产，张继宗说：彭市长号召我们今年增产半成到一成，现在我们差不多超过了一成，有的超过二成多。明年我们一定要更好地增产节约，支援中国人民志愿军。工商界代表一致表示
    一定消灭贪污行贿现象
    工商界代表在发言中一致表示：工商界一定要消灭贪污、行贿现象和一切恶习陋规。工商联合会主任委员傅华亭说：工商界有许多不法分子，损公利己，行贿勾引工作干部，损害国家和人民的利益。正当工商业者对他们这种犯法行为，非常痛恨。我们工商界一定全体动员起来，为彻底消灭贪污行贿现象而奋斗。我们已开过大小一千五百九十六次动员会，参加人数四万五千二百六十八人，在二十六、七两天，坦白和检举的人已有四百多。不过，有些工商业者对这个运动的认识还很不够。因此必须继续进行普遍深入的宣传动员，作到家喻户晓。全市工商业者对贪污行贿事实，要忠诚彻底地坦白，勇敢地检举。工商联合会和各行业同业公会的委员如果自己不干净的，应该首先坦白。糕点糖果业主任委员马兰亭说：为了国家经济建设和正当工商业的发展，我们工商界一定向行贿的不法商人进行围剿！工商联合会副主任委员乐松生、营造业主任委员刘元敬和粮食业主任委员常子久，在发言中更进一步揭发了工商界中行贿和收买工作人员的不法行为。乐松生说：根据最近几天各行业的工商业者的坦白材料，行贿、陋规，普遍存在。据无线电业的人说，全业会员有一百多户，约有八十多户有这些现象。针织业联营第一组替百货公司加工做绒衣六千五百打，按照“规定”：每块纱交绒布一百零三两，实际上不止出这些成品，但他们只按“规定”数交了货。最近，展开反贪污、反浪费运动后，他们才交回绒衣四百二十六打，价值两亿多元。还有很多工商业者坦白了自己的恶习和行贿行为，检举了一些机关工作人员的贪污行为，例如：某机关在鲁麟商行前后共买两亿多元的货，就加了两千多万元的“回扣”；初起造纸厂去年十二月间卖给某机关灰报纸二千五百令，每令十三万八千元，发票上却开成每令十四万元，经手人员共得“回扣”五百万元。乐松生代表说：“现在，我们工商界正在积极开展这一运动，希望全市各界，特别是工人朋友们，积极帮助我们，彻底肃清贪污、行贿和恶习陋规。”刘元敬代表说：营造业行贿的现象是很普遍的。行贿的结果，使国家的基本建设工程遭受严重的损失。这几天，已经有五十多个营造业单位，坦白了自己的行贿行为。我们一定要在这个运动中努力改造我们营造业。常子久代表说：我们粮食业有
    一种恶习，就是凡是机关团体来买东西，先和采买人讲底子钱。掌柜的总是告诉学徒说：“只要他吃一个，我们就能至少得两个。”意思是说他贪污对我们就有利。解放后，虽然也碰到好的干部，拒绝这一套。但是我们还没有彻底认识这种恶习对国家和人民的危害。现在我认识到勾引干部贪污，会影响我们国家的建设。只有把这可耻恶习消灭，工商业才会有正当发展。我一定把大会的精神传达给工商业户，使同业消除顾虑，勇敢地坦白和检举贪污行贿事实。新药业主任委员王敏生在发言中指出工商界的自新之路，他说：现在有些行贿的人存在各种顾虑，不愿坦白。这是大错特错的！各界人民都已经动了起来，布置下天罗地网，希图侥幸是不行的，坦白承认错误，才是自新之路。北京市供销合作总社主任王纯在发言时，用很多事实说明一部分曾在国民党军政机关工作的人员的贪污行为和不法商人的勾引。他说：合作社贪污分子的“技巧”很高，有二十多种贪污方式。他们说：“这是旧法新用、有所不同。”原来在旧社会里贪污是公开的，现在要偷偷摸摸。同时不法商人的勾结干部，更是千方百计。比如合作货栈一干部和私商讲买卖，在背上抓了一下痒，这商人马上就送来治痒的药；某肥皂厂经理，看见区联社副主任上医院，他在后面跟着追问要买什么药；干部自行车上灯不亮，他就送磨电滚子；假若你是回族干部，他买了点心特意告诉这是清真的；他说：“没有上不了我的钩的人”！他们说勾引干部有五部曲：先请吃香烟，然后到街上转一转，碰上小馆吃便饭，洗个澡，上戏院，最后再问“同志，有没有困难”。不法商人就这样无耻地勾引干部。最近，干部要坦白贪污事实，他们竟又设法威胁干部，说：“某干部贪污的少，我给他说贪污很多，结果法院叫他劳动改造去了。”某店员检举了经理和零售公司干部勾结贪污行贿以后，接到一封信说：“我要白刀子进去，红刀子出来”对这样抗拒运动的不法分子，王纯主任建议全市召开大会，把这些人拉到台上，镇压他！最后，王纯主任说：这运动开展后，群众非常欢迎，合作社的信誉马上提高了。贪污干部雷鸿康的老婆说：“这回可好了，政府管教他去了！”私营企业工人代表发言
    决加强劳资团结增产节约
    新药业工会主席刘政宗、油盐粮业工会主席高福、铁工业工会副主席高金铎、建筑工会副主席崔海澄、用品修造业工会主席施雨人、五金业工会主席马景和等私营企业工人代表，在发言中指出：不法商人勾引干部，偷漏税款，盗窃国家财产的情况是严重的。刘政宗代表说：“五金业工人开了四次座谈会，参加的一百五十多人，就检举了行贿、受贿事件五十多起。新药业工人在一个四、五十人的座谈会上，也检举了三十多起。五金业有个资本家大量漏税，被查出后，马上托人‘说合’行贿，光给‘说合人’就给了七百多万元，贿赂贪污分子的当然更多。”崔海澄代表说：“私营东生营造厂和海丰营造厂用下饭馆、跳舞等手段，勾引某军区建筑部副经理支振斌，又行贿几千万元，让支把标底卖给他们。”代表们说明了有些资方还在阻挠、破坏这个运动。刘政宗代表说：“他们坦白时避重就轻。有的把自己行贿说成干部借钱；有的只说请客吃饭，不说大量行贿；有的只说干部贪污，不说自己偷税盗窃。还有些资方找工人座谈，想摸工人的底，堵工人的嘴。”施雨人代表说：“华东电料行经理李锡朋屡次把劣货高价卖给公家。经店员李源告发后，他就找岔把李源打了一顿。大中华钟表店经理周香璞，去年少报流水三亿多，贿赂干部一个手表，怕工人告发，就想尽办法，非要解雇工人不可。但是，不管不法商人怎样阻挠、破坏，我们工人还是要大胆检举的。”崔海澄代表说：“四明电料行包做公家工程，勾结干部，多报工数，浪费器材。工人夏德龙检举了资方，资方就把他解雇了。政府应该迅速将资方法办，并表扬这样的工人。”代表们指出：一年以来，私营企业中增产节约成绩很大。但是少数资方，却以增产节约为藉口，任意延长工时，降低工资，降低伙食标准，这都是不合劳资两利的政策的。代表们并表示：一定要纠正资方这种错误行为，加强劳资团结，积极开展增产节约运动。文教界和青年、妇女代表表示
