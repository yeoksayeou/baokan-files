Ninth Paragraph Ellipsis

Ellipsis in quotations. An ellipsis consists of six dots, taking up the space of two characters; some people like to put a long string of them, which is unnecessary.

The usage of ellipsis can be discussed separately according to the occasions where it is applied. The first is when quoting existing words. For example:

　　(1) "Down with the great powers..." This song, the
　　　　kids on the street of course almost everyone knows
　　　　how to sing, even the kids in the countryside also
　　　　know how to sing it. (Mao)

　　(2) Butler also said: If the current situation continues,
　　　　"We will not be able to buy what we need. ...
　　　　In fact, we will go bankrupt, have no work to do, and no food
　　　　to eat."

　　(3) Therefore, they would tell their families: "...You
　　　　must have heard that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers
　　　　will kill the prisoners. Don't believe these words...." (Newspaper)

Example (1) only quotes the first sentence of the song lyrics, and the rest is omitted, indicated by an ellipsis. In example (2), there are omissions within the quotation, and in example (3), there are omissions before and after the quotation, all indicated by an ellipsis.

Ellipsis outside quotations. The second is when writing one's own words. Here, the ellipsis represents a list, and its function is equivalent to "etc." or "and so on." For example:

　　(4) If there really is such a day, then monks, Taoists, wizards,
　　　　astrologers, feng shui masters... will all yield their thrones to
　　　　scientists, and we will no longer have to see gods and ghosts all year round. (Lu)

The ellipsis is now used too much, and in many places it would be better to use "etc." or "and so on." The "or..." in the following sentence is very awkward; there is no such usage:

　　(5) Although it is not about production, or... it seems that it does not have a major relevance to the current work, but it is still useful for people's minds. (Education)

If it is writing one's own words and not used to represent "etc.," the ellipsis has no meaning. For example:

　　(6) Jin Doushe called on the tank soldiers, saying: "The time has come for the motherland and the people!
　　　　The tanks are the property of the people; we must live and die with the tanks!" They then picked up rifles and hand grenades and fought the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. ... (Newspaper)

"Usage of Punctuation Marks" says it well: "Ellipsis should not be used casually. Meanings that must be known by the other party should definitely not be omitted, and naturally there is no need to use ellipsis. Meanings that do not need to be known by the other party should not be said at all, and there is also no need to use ellipsis."

Ellipsis in dialogue. The third is when recounting other people's words. This is a situation that falls between the previous two, neither writing one's own words nor copying existing records. Ellipsis here has several functions. For example:

　　(7) A deputy battalion commander named Jin Songwan stood up and said: "I
　　　　want to report to the dear Chinese comrades in Chinese...".
　　　　(Newspaper)

The ellipsis here indicates a real omission, similar to the situation in (1) and (2). It is said that recounting other people's words is different from copying existing records, and it is inherently difficult to record every word without any omissions; there are always some omissions. If ellipsis were used to indicate everything, the page would be full of dots. Therefore, the general habit is to not use ellipsis, regardless of whether what is recorded is complete. However, (6) is somewhat different; what is recorded is clearly just the beginning of a speech. But the author only needs to record that this Korean comrade wanted to report to the Chinese comrades in Chinese; the words below are not important and do not need to be written out. Therefore, ellipsis must be used to indicate this. However, many authors really like to use this ellipsis, and we often encounter it in plays and novels, but it is not always necessary. The two sentences quoted earlier are still worth remembering: write out what the reader needs to know, and do not write out what the reader does not need to know. Using ellipsis too much can confuse the reader.

　　(8) I’m… I’m sorry! I… I probably went to the wrong door. (Cao Yu)
　　(9) One meter, two meters, three meters… eight, deep enough. (Education)
　　(10) That’s right. Let me think… we met in 1928. (Mao Dun, translation)
　　(11) When couples fight, they might even divorce… Uh, see, I forgot again, is… is it called divorce? Sigh! That’s what it is! You… Lao Kang, you don’t know how unlucky I am! (Kang Zhuo)

The ellipsis in these four sentences does not indicate omissions. (8) describes someone who is flustered and stutters. (9) indicates that after "three meters," the numbers "one," "two," "three" to "seven" were not counted out, and only when it was finished as "three meters eight" was "eight" said.

(10) describes "thinking." (11) also describes thinking while speaking, speaking intermittently. The ellipsis in these sentences,

on the one hand, indicates a pause in the words, and on the other hand, indicates the prolongation of the sound; the words are broken but not completely interrupted. Some people use a dash here, which is not wrong. But if you want to distinguish between these two symbols, then you can say: anything that "ends abruptly" is suitable for a dash, and anything that is "lingering" is suitable for an ellipsis. Like this sentence:

　　(12) Little Tang said: "Get ready, the stupid cow is com..." The
　　　　word "com" had just come out of his mouth when he was hit in the left arm by the enemy's machine gun, and fresh blood flowed down his sleeve. (Newspaper)

is an example of using an ellipsis when a dash should have been used.

Earlier, it was said that ellipsis indicates the prolongation of the sound, but in fact, the ending of the previous word does not necessarily extend to the beginning of the next word; there may be a moment of silence in between. Therefore, ellipsis is also used to indicate silence. For example:

　　(13) Is this the manufacturing bureau? Please let Ji Xifu Siqi listen to the phone.
　　　　…Hello, is this Sergey? What’s wrong with you? … No,
　　　　no one has come yet. (Newspaper)

Ellipsis and commas. Finally, we must also talk about the commas before and after the ellipsis. The general trend is: if there is a complete sentence before the ellipsis, use a period after it, then add an ellipsis, such as in example (2) and the second instance of example (3), indicating that what is omitted is another sentence (or several sentences), not part of a sentence. If there is not a complete sentence before, even though you could use a comma or enumeration comma, don't, as in example (1) and example (4). In example (10) and the first instance of example (11), there is also a complete sentence before the ellipsis, but no period is used because, as mentioned above, the ellipsis here does not represent omission but indicates the prolongation of the sound. In example (7), a period is added outside the quotation marks. According to general custom, the period of a quotation after a colon should be inside, but now, presumably because the end of the quotation is an ellipsis, it is moved outside. In fact, this period can be omitted. There are also cases where a period is used after the ellipsis, such as:

　　(14) I congratulated him and said: "Comrade! Congratulations on your
　　　　achievements! A tall building rises from the ground; this is your achievement
　　　　….” (Newspaper)

If the above sentence is complete (this example seems to be the case), the period should be before the ellipsis; if the above sentence is incomplete and the second half of the sentence has been omitted, there is no need to use a period to end it.

Tenth Paragraph Separation Mark,
　　　　Hyphen,
　　　　Proper Name Mark, Book Title Mark,
　　　　Emphasis Mark

Separation mark. The separation mark is a dot, used in between the surname and given name of foreigners. For example:

　　(1) Joseph·Vissarionovich·Stalin. If an enumeration comma is used here, it will cause people to misunderstand that there are three people.

Hyphen. The hyphen is a short dash. In European languages, the main use of the hyphen is to indicate a certain type of compound word (combining two words into one). Our current writing system does not leave a space between words, so of course we do not need a hyphen. It is only useful when proper names are combined with proper names. For example:

　　(2) Joliot-Curie.

　　(3) The 1908 Root-Takahira Agreement, the 1917
　　　　Lansing-Ishii Agreement. (Newspaper)

　　(4) Pictured is the construction site of the No. 13 lock
　　　　of the Volga-Don Canal. (Newspaper)

(2) is a person's compound surname. (3) are two people, and (4) are two rivers, but here they all become a unit of meaning. The meaning of “—” here is “and,” but the meaning of this “and” cannot be expressed by an enumeration comma.

This hyphen is also sometimes used improperly, such as:

　　(5) In recent years, American monopoly capitalists have been "aiding"
　　　　Britain and other Western European capitalist countries. Churchill—
　　　　Attlee—Bevin are all grateful to them. (Newspaper)

There is only a common parallel relationship between the three names here, and an enumeration comma is sufficient. Below is an example of where a hyphen should have been used but was not:

　　(6) Despite saying that Indian Buddhism indirectly brought about the influence of "Greco-Buddhist
　　　　art"… (Journal)

There should be a hyphen between "Greek" and "Buddhist" here to indicate that this art is the result of a combination of Greek art and Buddhist art. Without a hyphen, it is easy to raise the reader's question: does Greece have Buddhism? (According to the example of "Volga-Don Canal," if we do not use the abbreviation "Jinghan Road" and instead use "Beijing Hankou Railway," then a hyphen should also be used between "Beijing" and "Hankou.")

The hyphen is usually printed as a long dash in general books and periodicals, which is indistinguishable from a dash. Perhaps it is because the short dash is not obvious; if it cannot be changed, it can only be considered another usage of the dash. In our opinion, the basic functions of these two symbols are different: the dash is "break," and the hyphen is "connect." If there are no special technical difficulties, it would be better to distinguish them.

Proper name mark, book title mark. The proper name mark is a straight line, added to the left or right of the names of people, places, and various organizations. The book title mark is a wavy line, added to the left or right of the titles of books, articles, and publications.

Now, except in textbooks, these two symbols are rarely used in general books and periodicals. The main reason is naturally that typesetting is laborious, but the use of these two symbols often involves difficult problems, which also makes people reluctant to use them. For example, it is very inconsistent whether the proper name line is only drawn next to the proper name or all the way to the side of words such as "country," "province," "county," "continent," and "Mr." under the proper name. Also, names such as "North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition" and "Readers' Letters Group" are not always consistently underlined. There are really many such ambiguous situations; not only is the format of one bookstore not completely the same as that of another bookstore, but the format of one book in the same bookstore is not completely the same as that of another book. Therefore, if these two symbols are to be applied, a very detailed regulation is needed.

In books and periodicals that do not use these two symbols, book titles are replaced with quotation marks, and the names of people and places are not marked with symbols. Proper names other than names of people and places are also sometimes enclosed in quotation marks. See the sixth paragraph above.

Emphasis mark. Important sentences or words in an article can use emphasis marks. Sentences that are not important in meaning but have a special reason to draw the reader's attention can also be marked with an emphasis mark, as in example (5) in the seventh paragraph above.

Emphasis marks are generally dots, added on the right. If it is only one or two words, most people use quotation marks instead of side dots. Sometimes, two types of emphasis marks need to be used at the same time, and the second type is circled on the side; wavy lines or straight lines can also be used (especially in books and periodicals that do not use proper name marks and book title marks). In horizontally arranged books and periodicals, often only one type of emphasis mark is also used: wavy lines or straight lines, and the use of dots is relatively rare.

　　语法、修辞讲话（第六讲）
　　吕叔湘、朱德熙
　　第九段    省略号
    引文中的省略号。省略号一共六个圆点，占两个字的地位；有人喜欢点上一长串，那是不必的。
    省略号的用法可以就它应用的场合来分别讨论。第一是在引用现成的言辞的时候。例如：
    （一）“打倒列强……”这个歌，街上的小孩子
        固然几乎人人晓得唱，就是乡下的小孩子也
        有很多晓得唱了的。（毛）
    （二）巴特勒还说：目前的情况如果继续下去，
        “我们将不能购买我们所需要的东西。……
        事实上，我们将要破产，无工可做，也无饭
        可吃。”
    （三）因此他们才会告诉他们的家属：“……你
        一定听到朝鲜人民军与中国志愿军要把俘虏
        杀掉。不要相信这些话。……”（报）例（一）只引用歌词的第一句，底下都省略了，用省略号表示。例（二）的引文当中有省略，例（三）的引文前后有省略，都用省略号表示。
    引文外的省略号。第二是在写自己的话的时候。这里的省略号代列举，作用等于“等等”或“之类”。例如：
    （四）假如真有这一日，则和尚、道士、巫师、
        星相家、风水先生……的宝座就都让给了科
        学家，我们也不必整年的见神见鬼了。（鲁）这个省略号现在有用得太多的趋势，有许多地方不如用“等等”或“之类”。下面这句的“或……”很别扭，没有这样的用法：
    （五）它虽然不是写生产，或……仿佛对目前的工作没有大的相关，可是对于人的头脑仍是有用的。（教）如果写自己的话，而不是用来代“等等”，那个省略号就没有意义。如：
    （六）金斗燮号召坦克手说：“为祖国为人民的
        时候到了！坦克是人民的财产，我们要与坦
        克共存亡！”他们便拿起步枪和手榴弹跟敌
        人肉搏。……（报）“标点符号用法”里说得好：“省略号不该随便用。必须让对方知道的意思，决不能省略，那自然不需用省略号。不必让对方知道的意思，不说就算了，也不需用省略号。”
    对话中的省略号。第三是在记述别人的话的时候。这是介乎前两种情况之间的一种情况，既不是写自己的话，也不是抄录已经有过记录的话。这里的省略号有好几种作用。例如：
    （七）一个叫金松万的副大队长站起来说：“我
        要用中国话向亲爱的中国同志报告……”。
        （报）这里的省略号表示真正的省略，跟前面（一）（二）的情形相同。按说，记述别人的话跟抄录现成的记录不同，本来很难得一字不漏地记下来，总是多多少少省略一些。如果全都用省略号来表示，必定满纸都是点子。所以一般习惯是不管记下来的是否完全，不用省略号。可是（六）不同些，记下来的显然只是一番话的一个起头。但是作者只要记下这位朝鲜同志要用中国话向中国同志报告这一点，底下的话倒无关重要，不必写出来。因此不得不用省略号来表示。可是有许多作者非常喜欢用这个省略号，我们在剧本和小说的对话里常常遇到，并不都有必要。前面引的两句话还是值得记住：要让读者知道的就写出来，不必让读者知道的就不写出来。多用省略号反而叫读者迷惑。
    （八）对……对不起！我……我大概是走错门
        了。（曹禺）
    （九）一米，二米，三米……八，够深了。（教）
    （十）对啦。让我想一想……我们是一九二八年
        认识的。（茅盾，译文）
    （十一）两口子闹不好，也兴休了……呃，你看
        我又忘了，是……是兴离婚吗？唉！就是这
        么个事！你……老康，你不知道我是好命苦
        哟！（康濯）这四句的省略号都不表示省略。（八）是形容一个人心里慌了，说话结结巴巴的。（九）是表示“三米”之后“一”“二”“三”到“七”都没有数出来，直到数完了是“三米八”，才说出个“八”。
    （十）是形容“想一想”。（十一）也是形容一边说着一边想着，说得断断续续的。这几句省略号，
    一方面表示词语的停顿，一方面又表示声音的延长，说的话断而未断。有人在这里用破折号，那也不能算错。不过假如要区别这两个符号，那末可以说：凡是“戛然而止”的宜于用破折号，凡是“余音袅袅”的宜于用省略号。像这一句：
    （十二）小唐说：“准备好，笨牛来……”“来”
        字刚出口，就叫敌人的机枪打中左膀子，鲜
        血顺着袖口流了出来。（报）就是应该用破折号而用了省略号的例子。
    前面说，省略号表示声音的延长，事实上也不见得当真前一个字的尾声一直延长到后一个字开始，中间可能有静默的时候。因此又有用省略号表示静默的。例如：
    （十三）是制造局吗？请纪席夫斯基听电话。
        ……喂，是谢尔盖吗？你怎么啦？……不，
        暂时还没有谁来。（报）
    省略号与句逗号。最后还得谈一谈省略号前后的句逗号。一般的趋势是：省略号的前面是个完整的句子，后面用句号，然后加省略号，如例（二）和例（三）的第二处，表示省略的是另一句（或几句），不是一句的一部分。如果前面不是个完整的句子，虽然可以用逗号或顿号也不用，如例（一）和例（四）。例（十）和例（十一）第一处的省略号前面也是完整的句子，但是不用句号，因为上面已经说过，这里的省略号不代表省略而表示声音的延长。例（七）在引号外面加句号。按一般的习惯，冒号之后的引文的句号应该在内，现在大概是因为引文末了是省略号，所以移在外面。其实这个句号是可以不用的。还有在省略号之后用句号的，如：
    （十四）我向他致贺说：“同志！庆贺你们的
        成就！万丈高楼从地起，这是你们的功绩
        ……。”（报）假如上面句子已完（这个例子好像是这样），句号应该在省略号前；假如上面句子未完，下半句已经省略，也无需用句号来结束了。
    第十段    分读号、连读号、
                专名号、书名号、
                着重号
    分读号。分读号是一个圆点，用在外国人的姓和名的中间。例如：
    （一）约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林。这里如果用顿号，会叫人误会是三个人。
    连读号。连读号是一个短划。在欧洲文字里，连读号的主要用处是表示某一类型的复合词（合两个词为一个词）。我们现在的文字根本不在词和词中间留空白，当然用不着连读号。只在专名和专名结合的时候用得着。例如：
    （二）约里奥—居里。
    （三）一九○八年的罗脱—高平协定，一九一七
        年的蓝辛—石井协定。（报）
    （四）图为伏尔加河—顿河运河的第十三号水闸
        建筑工程现场。（报）
    （二）是一个人的复姓。（三）是两个人，（四）是两条河，但在这里都成了一个意义单位。这里的“—”的意义是“和”，但是这个“和”的意义不是顿号所能表示。
    这个连读号也有用得不得当的，如：
    （五）几年来，美国的垄断资本家们在“援助”
        着英国和其他西欧资本主义国家。邱吉尔—
        艾德礼—贝文们对之都是感激涕零的。（报）这里的三个人名之间只有一种普通的并列关系，用顿号尽够了。底下是一个该用连读号而没有用的例子：
    （六）尽管说印度的佛教间接带来了“希腊佛教
        艺术”的影响……（期）这里的“希腊”和“佛教”之间应该有连读号，才能表示这个艺术是希腊艺术和佛教艺术结合的结果。没有连读号，很容易引起读者的疑问：难道希腊也有佛教吗？（照“伏尔加河—顿河运河”的例子，假如我们不用“京汉路”这个简称，而用“北京汉口铁路”，那末“北京”和“汉口”之间也要用连读号的。）
    连读号在一般书刊里都印成一长划，跟破折号没有区别。也许是因为短划不显，如果不能改过来，那就只能算作破折号的另一种用法。我们的意思，这两种符号的基本作用不同，破折号是“断”，连读号是“连”，假如技术上没有特殊困难，还是有分别好些。
    专名号、书名号。专名号是直线，加在人名、地名、以及各种机关团体的名称的左边或右边。书名号是波浪式的线，加在书名、篇名、刊物名的左边或右边。
    现在除教科书里还用外，一般书刊很少用这两种符号的。主要的原因自然是排印费工，可是这两种符号使用时常常有疑难问题，也使人不大愿意用。例如专名线只划在专名旁边还是一直划到专名底下的“国”“省”“县”“洲”“先生”等字的旁边，很不一律。又如“华北区城乡物资交流展览会”“读者来信组”这些名称，加线不加线也不很一律。诸如此类的游移两可的情形实在不少，不但这一个书店跟那一个书店的格式不完全相同，同一书店的这本书和那本书也不完全相同。所以，如果这两种符号还要应用，需要有一个很详细的规定。
    不用这两种符号的书刊里，书名改用引号，人名、地名不加符号，人名、地名以外的专名也有加引号的。参看前面第六段。
    着重号。文章中有重要的语句或字眼，就用得到着重号。不是意义重要的语句，但是有特殊理由要读者注意的，也可以加着重号，如前面第七段例
    （五）。
    着重号一般是用圆点，加在右边。如果只是一两个字，多数人不用旁点而用引号。有时候同时要用到两种着重号，第二种就用旁圈；也可以用浪线或直线（尤其在不用专名号和书名号的书刊里）。在横行的书刊里，往往只有一种着重号也用浪线或直线，用圆点的反而较少。
                     （本段完，全文未完）
