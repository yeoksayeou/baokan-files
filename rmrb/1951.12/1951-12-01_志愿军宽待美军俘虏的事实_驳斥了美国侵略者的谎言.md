    The Fact That the Chinese People's Volunteers Treated American Prisoners of War Generously
    Refutes the Lies of the American Aggressors
    Comrade Editor: I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers. When I saw the news in the People's Daily on November 17th about the American imperialists fabricating lies about the "murder of prisoners" by the Chinese and Korean People's forces, I felt extremely angry. The lenient policy of the Chinese People's Volunteers towards American and British invading army prisoners is one of the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Army. I am now going to write down the situation in which we treated prisoners generously on the Korean battlefield, so that people all over the world can know.
    During the Fourth Campaign, our unit pursued the American invading army and crushed one of their mechanized units ten kilometers away from Wonju. A very small unit of ours captured more than seventy American wounded soldiers. At that time, the troops were advancing very quickly, and they were far away from the rear transportation station, so the supply of materials was relatively difficult. We could only eat one meal a day, and medicines were also in short supply. However, we still did our best to treat the prisoners generously and treated the invading army, who had already laid down their weapons, with humanitarian spirit, giving them food and drink, and applying medicine to their wounds one by one. For those who were seriously injured, we specially transferred some stretchers that were used to carry our own wounded soldiers to carry them. Some prisoners had their cheeks pierced by bullets, or their hands were hit by four or five bullets, and they could not eat by themselves, so we personally and patiently fed them spoonful by spoonful, and also asked the translation comrades to explain our army's prisoner policy to them and tell them to rest assured. Some of these injured prisoners were moved to tears by our actions. They said they were unwilling to go back and be cannon fodder for the warmongers. Some prisoners were afraid that American planes would come and kill them, and they also said: even if they had to grit their teeth and endure the pain, they would follow the Chinese People's Volunteers to a safe place.
    This specific example proves that the shameless lies of the American warmongers cannot deceive the people of the world at all.

    志愿军宽待美军俘虏的事实
    驳斥了美国侵略者的谎言
    编辑同志：我是中国人民志愿军的一个战士。当我看到了十一月十七日人民日报登载的美帝国主义捏造所谓中朝人民部队“杀害俘虏”的谎言的消息后，真是感到气愤万分。中国人民志愿军对待美英侵略军俘虏的宽大政策，是中国人民军队的优良传统之一。我现在要把我们亲自在朝鲜战场上宽待俘虏的情形写在下面，让全世界人民都来知道。
    在第四次战役中，我部追击美国侵略军，在离原州十公里的地方打垮了他们的一个机械化部队。只是我们一个很小的单位就俘虏了七十多个美国伤兵。那时部队前进得很快，和后边的运输站离得较远，物资供给是比较困难的。我们一天只能吃上一顿饭，药品也很不充裕。但是我们仍旧尽最大的力量来宽待俘虏，用人道主义的精神来对待已经放下武器的侵略军，给他们吃喝，还给他们一个个地换上了药。对于伤重的，我们还特地抽调出一部分抬自己伤员的担架来抬他们。有的俘虏脸上的腮部被子弹打穿了，或者手上中了四、五颗子弹，自己不能吃饭，我们就亲自拿小勺耐心地一勺勺往他们的嘴里喂，并且还请翻译同志向他们解释我军的俘虏政策，叫他们安心。这些受伤的俘虏们有的被我们的行动感动得哭了。他们表示不愿回去再当战争贩子的炮灰了。有些俘虏怕美国的飞机来杀害他们，还说：咬着牙、忍着痛也要紧跟着中国人民志愿军走到安全的地方去。
    这个具体的例子，证明了美国战争贩子们的无耻谎言，是完全欺骗不了全世界人民的。中国人民志愿军某部战士    李萍
