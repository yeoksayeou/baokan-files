My Ideological Transformation
Director of the Technical Office of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, Jin Baoshan

From Depression to Activism

In the autumn of 1949, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was officially established. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, everyone was contributing their share to jointly build a prosperous and strong people's China. In early 1950, I returned to the embrace of the motherland with full enthusiasm. At that time, the friends in the medical and health circles I came into contact with showed an abnormal attitude. On the one hand, they praised the spirit of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army serving the people wholeheartedly, while on the other hand, some buried themselves in their specialized academic work, ignoring politics; others became discouraged and pessimistic because their suggestions were impractical and unworkable.

At the time, I was very surprised why some friends were not very happy in such a promising environment. Soon, I joined the work of the Central Ministry of Health and began to come into contact with new working methods and new work content. On the one hand, I felt that from the leadership down, cadres at all levels worked diligently and loyally, which was admirable; on the other hand, I was also not used to what I saw and heard. My own set of ideas starting from the individual also did not work, and I began to feel depressed, which made me understand why some friends had such a depressed mindset. Later, through continuous study, reading books on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, I slowly began to understand the Communist Party's correct propositions. The series of heroic patriotic movements such as Resisting America and Aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, as well as the unprecedented great achievements of New China in politics, economy, national defense, culture, and education, gave me the most practical and profound education. I deeply felt: why can't I muster the courage to serve the people wholeheartedly with a selfless spirit like my Communist Party friends? After all, at the age of sixty, I have too many old things in my mind and not enough new understanding. I must study hard and transform my thinking to eradicate the root of the disease. This also explains that what makes me depressed is nothing else but the heavy root of my own disease; if I don't eradicate the root of the disease, I will definitely not be able to absorb new things and work well in the new environment, and depression will occur. It wasn't until I participated in land reform work this summer, from studying land reform documents to participating in actual struggles, witnessing the landlord class's vicious exploitation and the peasants' oppression in the newly liberated rural areas, that I understood the significance of land reform, which gave me a deeper education in social revolution. I realized that land reform is a movement for peasants to stand up, a fierce class struggle. If the landlord class's feudal exploitation system is not abolished, rural productive forces cannot be liberated, agricultural production cannot be developed, and New China's industrialization cannot be realized. After this practical experience and training, my thinking has undergone a profound change. I regret that I took the wrong path for decades and did not properly use my potential to serve the people. In order to compensate for my mistakes, I am determined to follow the Communist Party and serve the people wholeheartedly.

	A Lifetime on the Wrong Path

I studied medicine in Japan, researched public health in the United States, and then worked for more than thirty years. At first, I taught in schools and made serum vaccines in laboratories. Later, I transferred to the Kuomintang government and did more than twenty years of health administration work. I prided myself on being "upright" and hardworking, but I had no people's standpoint in politics, and I only knew how to follow those pro-American elements and climb up. I asked the reactionary ruling class for funds, accepted subsidies sent by the American imperialists with ulterior motives, and established some medical and health institutions. I thought that by doing this, I could "benefit" society. In fact, these "beneficial" undertakings were just decorations for the reactionary ruling class. Later, seeing that the Kuomintang was completely corrupt, I thought that there was nothing to be done for the country, so I re-entered the education field in the first half of 1948. In the autumn, the United Nations Children's Fund asked me to be a consultant. At that time, I could not see the power of the people, and I blindly went to serve American imperialism. Judging from these facts, it fully shows that I lived a confused life, and more than thirty years of effort were only used by the reactionary government and imperialism, and there was no benefit to social progress at all, which is really shameful! The Chinese nation, under long-term feudalism and imperialism, must carry out a thorough revolution and move from new democracy to socialism. This is the only way to save the Chinese nation and the path I am determined to strive for in my later years.

	Some Experiences at Work

I have participated in the work of the Central Ministry of Health for a year and a half, and I have been greatly transformed by my work. Here, I will only give the following two examples to illustrate.

Last year, in order to implement the policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine, the Central Ministry of Health established a Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Studies School. I thought that it would be difficult for Chinese and Western medicine to unite and that it would not be easy to achieve the expected results. However, the facts of the past two years have proved that my thinking is wrong and that the purely technical viewpoint is at work. According to incomplete statistics for the first half of 1951, 940 cities and counties had Chinese and Western medical personnel jointly organizing medical workers' associations and Chinese medicine societies. Ten Traditional Chinese Medicine Advanced Studies Schools and thirty-four advanced study classes have been established nationwide. The traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who participated in the advanced studies worked hard to learn technology. During the advanced study process, Western medicine doctors from various medical colleges and major hospitals sincerely cooperated with traditional Chinese medicine doctors, and many specialized professors went to evening classes tirelessly. Due to their joint work, collective strength was brought into play, enabling various regions to complete many epidemic prevention and medical tasks. When I was engaged in land reform work, I personally saw the Chinese and Western doctors in the joint clinics working together to solve rural medical problems. Chinese and Western medicine has begun to embark on the road of "scientification of Chinese medicine and popularization of Western medicine." This was unimaginable in the era of the reactionary government.

In terms of medical education, according to the decision of the National Health Conference, senior medical colleges shortened the length of schooling and greatly increased the number of intermediate medical schools. At first, I was very skeptical, always thinking that medicine must have a profound scientific foundation and a long period of study in order to solve practical medical problems. But in fact, during the land reform period, I saw that many medical workers in rural joint clinics had not received formal medical training, and they could also use simple techniques and medicines to treat many patients. This proves that rural medical problems cannot be solved solely by specialized talents with profound knowledge. After land reform, there will be unprecedented prosperity in rural areas, and the demand for medical and health care will greatly increase. A large number of intermediate medical personnel and primary medical cadres must be trained in order to meet the urgent needs of the peasants. All ideas that do not start from the urgent needs of the broad masses of the people will hinder the progress of the country.

	More Effort Must Be Made to Study in the Future

Facts like these are testing me, educating me, and correcting many of my wrong views in my thinking. This makes me unable to thank the leading comrades for their enthusiasm and love for me. Facts have proved that only under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can everyone unite closely and move forward! As far as the current situation is concerned, the thinking of the general old medical workers has undergone many changes and progress, but the old things still remain more or less. If the old is not removed, the new cannot be put in. If the standpoint is not firm and the mass viewpoint is not established, it will unconsciously harm the interests of the people and hinder the development of the country in the work.

Therefore, we medical workers must redouble our efforts in the future, actively participate in the study movement of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and launch a more tenacious struggle on the ideological front, so that we can better strive for the construction of New China.

    我的思想变迁
    中央人民政府卫生部技术室主任  金宝善
    从苦闷到积极
    一九四九年秋天，中华人民共和国中央人民政府正式成立了。在共产党领导下，每个人都在贡献自己的一份力量，共同建设富强的人民中国。一九五○年初，我抱着满腔热忱，从国外回到祖国的怀抱。当时我所接触的医学卫生界的朋友，表现着一种不正常的态度。他们一方面颂扬人民政府和人民解放军全心全意为人民服务的精神，而另一方面有的只埋头于自己的专门学术，不问政治；有的因为自己所提意见不合实际，行不通而消沉、悲观。
    当时我很奇怪，为什么在这样前途很有希望的环境里，有些朋友们的情绪却不太愉快呢？不久，我参加了中央卫生部的工作，开始接触到了新的工作方法和新的工作内容。一方面觉得从领导方面起，各级干部忠心耿耿地苦干，令人佩服；另一方面，对所见所听的也感到不习惯。我的那一套从个人出发的想法也行不通，而开始了苦闷，由此也就体会到了
    一些朋友们为什么会有那样沉闷的思想。后来经过继续不断的学习，阅读关于马列主义和毛泽东思想的书籍，才慢慢地开始了解共产党的正确主张。抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等一连串轰轰烈烈的爱国主义运动和新中国在政治上、经济上、国防上、文化教育上的空前伟大的成就，给了我以最实际也最深刻的教育。我深深地感到：自己为什么不能鼓起勇气，像共产党的朋友们那样以忘我的精神，全心全意为人民服务呢？毕竟是六十岁的我，脑子里陈旧的东西太多了，新的认识不够，必须努力学习，改造思想，才能拔除病根。这也就说明使我苦闷的不是别的，完全是自己的病根太重；不拔除病根，就一定不能吸收新的事物，在新的环境中好好工作，而发生苦闷。一直到今年夏天参加土地改革工作，由学习土地改革文件到参加实际斗争，目睹新解放区农村中地主阶级的凶恶剥削、农民的被压迫，才明白了土地改革的意义，使我更深一步地得到了社会革命的教育。我认识了土地改革工作，是农民翻身的运动，是剧烈的阶级斗争。地主阶级封建剥削的所有制不废除，农村生产力无从解放，农业生产不能发展，新中国的工业化就不能实现。经过了这次实际的体验和锻炼，我的思想起了很深刻的变化。我后悔自己走了几十年的错路，没有把自己所能发挥的力量，正当地使用在为人民服务的方面。我为了补偿自己的过失，我决心要跟着共产党走，全心全意为人民服务。
        一生走了错路
    我在日本学医，在美国研究公共卫生，以后工作了三十多年。起初在学校教书，在实验室里制造血清疫苗。后来转入国民党政府，做了二十多年的卫生行政工作。自恃“清高”、肯干，但在政治上毫无人民立场，只知跟着那些亲美分子跑，往上爬。我请求过反动统治阶级拨经费，接受了别有用心的美帝国主义送来的补助，办过一些医药卫生机关。以为这样做，就可以为社会“造福”。其实这些为社会“造福”的事业，不过是为反动统治阶级装饰门面而已。后来看到国民党腐败透顶，以为国事无可为矣，便在一九四八年上半年从新转入教育界。到了秋天，联合国儿童基金会约我去当顾问，我当时看不见人民力量，竟盲然地去为美帝国主义服务。由这些事实看来，十足地说明了我糊里糊涂地混了一生，三十多年的努力，不过是为反动政府和帝国主义所利用，对于社会的进步没有丝毫的补益，真令人惭愧无已！在长期封建主义和帝国主义压迫下的中华民族，必须彻底革命，从新民主主义走向社会主义，这是救治中华民族的唯一的道路，也是我晚年决心竭力奋斗的道路。
        在工作上的一些体验
    我参加中央卫生部工作一年半，从工作中得到了莫大的改造。这里，我仅举出以下两个例子来说明。
    去年中央卫生部为贯彻团结中西医的政策，创办中医进修学校。我以为中西医很难团结，不容易得到预期的效果。但是两年来的事实表现，证明我的思想是错误的，是纯技术观点在作祟。根据一九五一年上半年不完全的统计，已有九百四十个市和县，中西医务人员共同组织了医务工作者协会和中医学会。全国建立了十个中医进修学校和三十四个进修班。参加进修的中医，都努力学习技术。在进修过程中，各医学院和各大医院的西医都真诚地和中医合作，许多专门的教授都不辞劳苦地去上夜课。由于他们共同工作，发挥了集体力量，使各地区完成了许多防疫医疗的任务。我在从事土地改革工作时，曾亲眼见到联合诊所的中西医士团结合作解决农村的医药问题，中西医已开始走上了“中医科学化，西医大众化”的道路。这是在反动政府时代，所不能想像的。
    在医学教育方面，根据全国卫生会议的决定，高级医学院校缩短修学年限，大量增设中级医士学校。起初我很怀疑，总以为医学必须有高深的科学基础和较长的修学时间，方能解决实际的医疗问题。但事实上，我在土地改革时期，看到许多乡村联合诊所的医务工作者，都未受过正规的医学训练，也能运用简单的技术和药品，救治了很多病人。这证明了农村医药问题，并不是光靠有高深知识的专门人才才能解决。在土地改革后，农村中将有史无前例的繁荣，对于医药卫生的要求，必将大大增加，必须培养大量中级医士和初级医务干部，才能适应农民的迫切需要。一切思想如不从广大人民迫切的需要出发，是会阻碍国家进步的。
    今后更须努力学习
    像以上这样的事实，一件一件地在考验着我、教育着我，也改正了我在思想上的许多错误观点。这使我不能不感谢领导同志对我的热诚和友爱。事实证明：只有在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下，大家才能紧密地团结在一起，向前迈进！就目前情况来说，一般旧的医务工作者的思想，已有了不少的转变和进步，但旧的东西依然或多或少地存留着。旧的不除掉，新的是装不进去的。立场不坚决，群众观点不树立，就会不知不觉地在工作中损害人民的利益，阻碍国家的发展。
    因此，我们医务工作者今后必须加倍努力，积极参加马克思列宁主义与中国革命具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习运动，在思想战线上展开更坚韧的斗争，使自己更好地为新中国的建设而努力。
