The Fifth National Cadre Conference of the Party decided to cease absorbing party members and developing the organization, actively rectify the Party, and strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of this correct policy for the past two years, the party affairs reorganization work of organizations across the country has been basically completed and has achieved certain results.

In December 1950, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee submitted a proposal to the entire party on developing the organization. Over the past year, this proposal has been carefully studied by comrades throughout the party, and it has been unanimously agreed that as the people's revolutionary cause is developing day by day, the tasks of the democratic parties are becoming more arduous, and it is necessary to develop the organization. At the same time, the Party has also possessed the necessary conditions for developing the organization after rectification and after being tempered by the three major movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, this conference agrees with the proposal of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee to develop the organization and makes the following decisions:

I. Developing the organization is for the purpose of expanding and consolidating the people's democratic united front; therefore, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it is necessary to further connect and unite the broad urban petty bourgeoisie in accordance with the Common Program and strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves, improve our political level, and strive to realize New Democratic construction and move towards socialism.

II. Developing the organization must be combined with mass movements, strengthen mass work, closely connect with the masses, and discover, cultivate, and absorb activists from the petty bourgeoisie in the actual struggle of the revolution and the practice of national construction.

III. Developing the organization must be based on middle and lower-level elements, with progressive elements as the backbone, while also absorbing some upper-level elements to achieve the purpose of developing unity and progress.

IV. Developing the organization must be combined with consolidating the organization. Seek development on the basis of consolidation. An important aspect of consolidating the organization is to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, strengthen ideological education, and strengthen organizational life.

V. Developing the organization should adopt a serious and cautious active attitude, oppose the unprincipled indiscriminate recruitment of party members, and prevent speculators or counter-revolutionaries from infiltrating the organization; at the same time, oppose passive closed-doorism, because this will cause the organization to stagnate, reduce the party's influence on the masses, and fail to complete its historical tasks.

VI. The steps for developing the organization should be planned and focused. At present, we should mainly concentrate our efforts on cultivating and developing backbone elements who are politically progressive and tend to be progressive, and who have shown positive performance in various movements. At the same time, attention should be paid to absorbing young male and female intellectuals to increase the Party's fresh blood. Regions where party affairs reorganization has not yet been completed will not be developed for the time being; those with unsound leadership institutions will not be developed for the time being.

VII. The development areas are large and medium-sized cities. The development targets should be determined according to the existing foundation, the specific conditions and possible conditions in various places. Basically, the focus is on middle and lower-level public and educational personnel, experts, technicians, and small industrialists and businessmen, and at the same time, pilot development should be carried out in economic construction departments. Party members will not be developed and organizational activities will not be carried out in the People's Liberation Army, public security forces, military organs, military schools, military enterprises, intelligence agencies, diplomatic departments, and revolutionary universities and old personnel training classes. Party members will also not be developed among ethnic minorities. The railway system will be postponed for development.

VIII. The issue of cross-membership in developing organizations. Members of democratic parties can have cross-membership with each other. However, for the sake of division of labor and cooperation in the united front, except for existing party members who already have cross-membership, in the new development, the general principle is not to have cross-membership. However, if cross-membership is necessary due to work needs, it shall be decided through consultation between the two organizations. Members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League should be encouraged to join the Party in appropriate numbers to strengthen the Party's leadership.

    中国农工民主党关于发展组织的决议
    （一九五一年十二月二日第六次全国干部会议第六次大会通过）
    本党第五次全国干部会议，曾决定停止吸收党员发展组织，积极整党和加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习，两年以来在这个正确的方针指导下，全国各地组织的党务整理工作，基本完成，并获得了一定的成绩。
    一九五○年十二月，中央执监委员会议，曾向全党提出了发展组织的建议案。这个建议案，一年来，经全党同志慎审研究，一致认为在人民革命事业日在发展当中，各民主党派的任务更加繁重，发展组织是必要的。同时，本党经过整理、经过抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的锻炼，亦已具备了发展组织的必要条件。因此，本会议同意中央执监委员会的发展组织的建议，并作如下决定：
    一、发展组织是为着扩大和巩固人民民主统一战线；因此，必须在中国共产党领导下，根据共同纲领，进一步联系和团结广大的城市小资产阶级并加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习，以改造自己，提高政治水平，为实行新民主主义建设并走向社会主义而奋斗。
    二、发展组织必须与群众运动相结合，加强群众工作，密切联系群众，从革命的实际斗争中和国家建设的实践中去发现、培养、和吸收小资产阶级中的积极分子。
    三、发展组织必须是以中下层分子为基础，进步分子为骨干，同时吸收部分上层分子以达成发展团结、进步之目的。
    四、发展组织必须与巩固组织相结合。在巩固的基础上求发展。巩固组织的重要环节，是在于运用批评与自我批评的武器，加强思想教育，加强组织生活。
    五、发展组织要采取严肃谨慎的积极态度，反对无原则的滥收党员，免使投机分子或反革命分子混入组织；同时也反对消极的关门主义，因为这会使组织停滞，减低党对群众的影响，不能完成历史任务。
    六、发展组织的步骤，要有计划地重点地发展，目前主要地要集中力量培养、发展在政治上进步和倾向进步，并在各种运动中表现积极的骨干分子。同时应注意吸收男女青年知识分子，以增加本党的新鲜血液。党务整理还没有完毕的地区暂不发展；领导机构还不健全的，暂不发展。
    七、发展地区为大中城市。发展对象，应根据现有基础，视各地具体情况和可能条件确定之。基本上以中下级的公教人员、专家、技术人员、小工商业者为主，同时向经济建设部门作试行发展。在人民解放军、公安部队、军事机关、军事学校、军事企业、情报机关、外交部门、以及革命大学与旧人员训练班之中不发展党员，不进行组织活动。少数民族中亦不发展党员。铁道系统，暂缓发展。
    八、发展组织的交叉问题。民主党派的成员可以互相交叉。但为统一战线的分工合作起见，除现有党员已交叉者外，在新发展中，一般以不交叉为原则，但因工作需要必须交叉时，由双方组织协商决定。中国共产党员、青年团员则尽量争取适当数量参加本党以加强本党领导。
