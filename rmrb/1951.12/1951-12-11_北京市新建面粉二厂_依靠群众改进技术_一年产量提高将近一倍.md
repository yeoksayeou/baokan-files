Beijing New No. 2 Flour Mill
    Relies on the Masses to Improve Technology
    Annual Output Increases by Nearly Double

    The workers of Beijing New No. 2 Flour Mill have been continuously improving their political consciousness for more than a year, actively improving technology, and increasing production by nearly double.

    In February 1950, when this factory started producing "August 1st" flour, the five sets of milling machines produced only 1,200 bags of flour per day. Later, the workers improved the sifter bottom, increasing the daily output to 1,300 bags. In November of last year, a production competition was launched, and the daily output increased to 1,400 bags. In August of this year, the flour path was improved again, and the daily output reached 1,500 bags. In particular, in October of this year, all employees took advantage of the maintenance opportunity to improve the machine flour path, grinding roller speed, etc., so that the daily output reached a new record of 2,000 bags, exceeding the original technical quota (200 bags) of each grinding machine by one time, reducing indirect costs by 20.5%. At the same time, due to the increase in the flour extraction rate, the state saved 30,000 catties of wheat per month. The two combined saved more than 500 million yuan for the whole year.

    The reasons for their achievements, in addition to the education and encouragement of patriotism in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, are mainly:

    First, attaching importance to technology and improving work. Technicians also became involved in the movement to improve production. Many employees stipulated in the patriotic pact to "break technical conservatism, learn technology, and exchange experience," making technological improvement a mass movement. Among the 24 technicians and technical workers in the factory, 15 proposed technical improvement suggestions.

    Second, the workers' experience and the technicians' theory were combined. For example, technician Yan Zhengyi believed that to increase the flour extraction rate, the scraping rate of less than 15% of the first grinding process must be increased to more than 30%. Therefore, he tried to tighten the first grinding mill. However, it was not successful. At this time, workers Zhang Zhenhai and Yu Shengfa, who were watching the plansifter, pointed out that the first grinding mill could not be tightened because it was restricted by the plansifter; they suggested changing the plansifter first. At the same time, worker Cao Baoshan also discovered that one plansifter grid was idle and unused. In this way, with the help of the workers, technician Yan Zhengyi, after careful study, finally changed the first grinding process, which originally used one gear, to two gears, and used the unused plansifter grid. In this way, the flour from the first grinding process was unrestricted in the plansifter, so that the scraping rate was truly increased to more than 30%. In addition, changing the original top-fine and bottom-coarse plansifter bottom to top-coarse and bottom-fine increased the flour extraction rate.

    Third, leading cadres promptly and clearly put forward requirements for increasing production, flour extraction rate, and grinding roller speed, pointing out the direction of efforts for the masses and inspiring the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Leading cadres also planned and organized research seminars, so that employees actively used their brains to propose rationalization proposals such as improving equipment during machine maintenance.

    After this practical education, the factory's employees reversed the past conservative thinking that "there is nothing to change in the machine, and these five machines cannot be changed," or "production cannot be improved," and improved the workers' confidence in improving the machine. Now the factory's employees are continuing to work hard to study technology, improve production, and strive to create more wealth for the country. (Han Bin)

### 北京市新建面粉二厂  依靠群众改进技术  一年产量提高将近一倍

    北京市新建面粉二厂
    依靠群众改进技术
    一年产量提高将近一倍
    北京市新建面粉二厂职工，一年多以来政治觉悟不断提高，积极改进技术，使产量提高将近一倍。
    一九五○年二月，这个厂开始制“八一”面粉的时候，五部磨每天仅生产一千二百袋面粉。后来职工改进了箩底，把每天产量提高到一千三百袋。去年十一月展开了生产竞赛，每天产量增加到一千四百袋。今年八月又改进了粉路，每天产量达到一千五百袋。特别是今年十月，全体职工利用检修机会，改进机器粉路、磨辊转速等，使每天产量达到二千袋的新纪录，超过了原来每部磨的技术定额（二百袋）的一倍，使间接成本降低了百分之二十点五。同时，由于出粉率的提高，每月又给国家节省小麦三万斤。两者合计，全年节约了五亿元以上。
    他们做出这些成绩的原因，除抗美援朝爱国主义的教育与鼓舞以外，主要是：
    第一，重视技术，改进工作。技术人员也卷入了改进生产的运动。很多职工在爱国公约中都规定要“打破技术保守，学习技术，交流经验”，使改进技术形成群众性的运动。全厂二十四个技术人员和技术工人中，提出改进技术建议的就有十五人。
    第二，工人的经验和技术人员的理论结合了起来。例如：技术员严正仪认为要提高出粉率，就必须把第一道磨不及百分之十五的刮粉率提高到百分之三十以上。因此，他就试验把第一道磨子加紧。可是，没有成功。这时，看平筛的工人张振海、于盛发指出：第一道磨不能加紧，是受平筛的限制；他们提议先改平筛。同时工人曹宝珊又发现一个平筛格闲着没有利用。这样，在工人的帮助下，技术员严正仪经过精心钻研后，终于把原来走一档格的头道磨改走两档格，并且把那个没有用的平筛格利用起来。这样，就使头道磨下来的粉在平筛里不受限制，使刮粉率真正提高到百分之三十以上。加以把原来上细下粗的平筛箩底改为上粗下细，就增加了出粉率。
    第三，领导干部及时明确地提出增加生产量、出粉率及磨辊的转速的要求，给群众指出了努力的方向，鼓舞了职工们的积极性及创造性。领导干部并且有计划地组织了研究会，使职工们在检修机器中，纷纷开动脑筋，提出改进设备等合理化建议。
    该厂职工经过这次实际教育之后，扭转了过去总认为“机器没啥改，再变变不了这五部机器”，或“生产提高不了”的保守思想，提高了职工改进机器的信心。现在该厂职工正在继续努力钻研技术，提高生产，争取为国家创造更多的财富。（汉斌）
