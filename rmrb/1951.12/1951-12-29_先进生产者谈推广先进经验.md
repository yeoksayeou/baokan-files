Our Industrial Group
On December 17th, we invited active elements from six state-owned and public enterprises in Beijing to discuss how to promote advanced production experience.

From everyone's speeches, we found that each factory and mine has advanced experience worth promoting; there are even more rationalization proposals. Peng Xingde, national railway labor model and worker at the Xizhimen Engineering Machinery Repair Plant, said that the turnout production team he leads has improved 113 tools since responding to the challenge from the Ma Hengchang team on February 8th. Peng Xingde's team proactively united with technical personnel to create a method of welding shaped rails that can save fishplates, and a method of welding bottom joints. If these two methods are promoted within the national railway system, they could save the country wealth worth 140 billion yuan a year. Hu Jinsheng, a worker in the tool workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, said that they originally used files to file hexagonal screw waste edge punches and square screw nut punches, spending two and a half to three hours on each one; now they use milling machines to file them, which only takes fifteen minutes for each one. Since June, their workshop alone has improved six tools. As a result, they completed the annual plan of increasing production and saving 300 jin of millet per person in November. The productivity of the screw workshop has also increased by two to three times due to the workers' tool improvements.

Hu Shaoliang, production committee member of the No. 1 Maintenance Depot of the Beijing Public Bus Company, said that they have strengthened automobile maintenance, improved coal addition methods and filtration work, reducing the average failure time per 100 kilometers from 35 minutes to 8 minutes, with the best reduction to just over a minute. But other maintenance depots have not achieved this.

From everyone's speeches, we can also learn that the administrative and trade union leaders of various factories and mines attach different degrees of importance to summarizing and promoting advanced experience, and handling workers' rationalization proposals:

First, they truly value advanced experience and rationalization proposals, and summarize them in a timely manner and promote them in a planned way. At present, there are very few cases like this. Judging from the speeches at the symposium, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has done a relatively good job. After the Ministry of Railways learned that Peng Xingde had created a method of welding shaped rails and a method of welding bottom joints, it held a training class, transferring technical cadres from various railway administrations to learn from Peng Xingde, so that Peng Xingde's advanced experience could be promoted throughout the national railway system in the future. This training class ended on December 21st.

Second, some cadres do not pay enough attention to advanced experience and rationalization proposals. They only reward them, without summarizing and promoting them, or they summarize them untimely and do not promote them in a planned way. This type of situation is the most common. Zhang Jizhen, a worker in the fifth shift of the first sewing department of the Beijing Garment Factory, said that there is a sewing machine operator in their shift named Zheng Zhikun, who has particularly good skills and operating methods. When others are working, they all use their hands to hold the sewing machine wheel, and they get flustered when they are busy; only Zheng Zhikun does not hold the wheel, and she is always organized no matter how busy she is; she has a half-month work plan and a daily work plan. Therefore, her production efficiency is higher than others. The workers often hold meetings to study her experience, but they cannot find the trick. Zheng Zhikun herself cannot explain the reason. The cadres of the grassroots trade union did not help the workers study and summarize Zheng Zhikun's experience well, they just drew Zheng Zhikun's production achievements into cartoons and praised her. The grassroots trade union cadres and administrative leaders of the Beijing Public Bus Company are also like this. They have rewarded advanced producers and held worker symposiums, calling on workers to learn from advanced experience, but they have not seriously summarized advanced experience and promoted it in a planned way. The leading cadres of the Shijingshan Power Plant pay close attention to cultivating advanced production teams, but they have not summarized and promoted the experience of advanced production teams in a timely manner. Therefore, the experience of the Liang Fengchang team in uniting technical personnel, improving operating techniques, and creating a record of 2,400 hours of continuous boiler operation without extinguishing the fire has not been summarized and promoted.

Third, some leading cadres do not pay attention to advanced experience and rationalization proposals at all. Of course, this situation only accounts for a minority. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant is like this. Because the workers improved the tools, the tool workshop improved production efficiency in August. The people in the planning office said that the workers had miscalculated the work. The workers handed over the rationalization proposals to the trade union, and the trade union transferred them to the administrative side for review; but the administrative side did not deal with them for a long time. The administrative leaders sometimes gave bonuses to people who made rationalization proposals, but they and the trade union never publicly praised the people who won the bonuses. Therefore, no one knows who made what suggestions, let alone promote advanced experience.

Because the leading cadres, especially the trade union cadres, have not summarized and promoted advanced experience in a timely manner, the role of advanced experience in production is not
big. This is a problem that deserves serious attention.

    先进生产者谈推广先进经验
    本报工业组
    十二月十七日，我们邀请了北京市六个国营、公营企业的积极分子，座谈怎样推广先进生产经验的问题。
    从大家的发言中，发现各厂矿都有值得推广的先进经验；合理化建议更多。全国铁路劳动模范、西直门工务机械修配厂工人彭兴德说，他领导的道岔生产小组，自二月八日向马恒昌小组应战后，改进工具一百十三件。彭兴德小组主动地团结技术人员，创造了可节省鱼尾板的焊接异型钢轨方法，和焊底接头方法。如果把这两个方法在全国铁路系统内推广起来，一年就可以给国家节省价值一千四百亿元的财富。华北农业机械总厂工具车间工人胡金声说，他们原来用锉刀锉六方螺丝废边冲头和四方螺丝母冲头，每锉一只就用二小时半到三小时；现在他们改用铣刀来锉，每铣一只只要十五分钟。六月份以后，仅他们一个车间，就改进了六件工具。因此，他们在十一月份就完成了每人增产节约三百斤小米的全年计划。螺丝车间的生产率，也由于工人改进了工具，提高了二倍到三倍。
    北京市公共汽车公司第一保养场生产委员胡绍良说，他们加强了汽车保养工作，改进了加煤方法和滤清工作，使每辆车平均每走一百公里的故障时间，从三十五分钟减到八分钟，最好的减到一分多钟。但别的保养场却没有做到这样。
    从大家的发言中还可以知道：各厂矿的行政、工会领导干部，在总结和推广先进经验，以及处理工人合理化建议的工作上，重视的程度是不同的：
    一、真正重视先进经验和合理化建议，及时地加以总结和有计划地推广。在目前，像这类的情况还很少。从座谈会上的发言来看，中央人民政府铁道部做得是比较好的。铁道部知道彭兴德创造焊接异型钢轨方法和焊底接头方法以后，就举办了一个训练班，调各铁路管理局的技术干部来向彭兴德学习，以便将来在全国铁路范围内推广彭兴德的先进经验。这个训练班已于十二月二十一日结束。
    二、有些干部对先进经验和合理化建议重视不够。他们只管奖励，而不加以总结和推广，或者总结得不及时和没有有计划地推广。这类情况是最普遍的。北京被服厂第一缝纫部第五班工人张继珍说，她们班里有个叫做郑志坤的车工，她的技术特别好，操作方法也好。别人干活时全用手扶缝纫机车轮，工作忙时就乱起来；唯独郑志坤不扶车轮，工作再忙也有条不紊；她有半月的工作计划，有每天的工作计划。因此，她的生产效率比别人的都高。工人们常常开会研究她的经验，但都找不出窍门来。郑志坤自己也说不出其中道理来。基层工会的干部没有很好地帮助工人研究和总结郑志坤的经验，他们只是把郑志坤的生产成绩画成漫画，表扬一番了事。北京市公共汽车公司的基层工会干部和行政领导干部也是这样。他们曾经奖励先进生产者，曾经召开工人座谈会，号召工人学习先进经验，但是，他们没有认真地总结先进经验，并加以有计划地推广。石景山发电厂的领导干部很注意培养先进生产小组，但没有及时总结和推广先进生产小组的经验。所以，梁凤昌小组团结技术人员、改进操作技术、创造二千四百小时锅炉不灭火的纪录的经验，没有得到总结和推广。
    三、有些领导干部是根本不重视先进经验和合理化建议的。当然这种情况也只占少数。华北农业机械总厂就是这样。由于工人改进了工具，工具车间在八月份提高了生产效率。计划室的人反说是工人估工错了。工人把合理化建议交给工会，工会就把它转给行政方面审查；但行政方面很久都不处理。行政领导干部有时候也发奖金给提合理化建议的人，但他们和工会从来没有公开表扬过得奖金的人。因此，到底谁提过什么建议，别人都不知道，更谈不上推广先进经验了。
    由于领导干部，特别是工会干部，没有及时地总结和推广先进经验，先进经验在生产上的作用就不
    大。这是值得严重注意的问题。
