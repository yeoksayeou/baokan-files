　　The propagandists' propaganda work changes the face of Zhongzhou Township
       Wang Yuncong

    Since Zhongzhou Township in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, established propagandists, they have played a promoting and organizing role in various tasks, enabling rapid progress in the work of the entire township. The township, originally relatively backward, has now become a vibrant and advanced township.

    Zhongzhou Township has four natural villages, 416 households, and more than 1,900 people. It has not yet established a Party organization. The work of the propagandists is established through the Communist Youth League branch under the direct leadership of the Party's district committee. Eleven of the township's twenty-four propagandists are members of the League. The propagandists are divided into four groups according to the four natural villages, controlling four broadcasting stations, four blackboard newspapers, seven reading groups, and a rural theater troupe.

    Before April this year, Zhongzhou Township had not yet established propagandists, the masses were not highly aware, and there was a general sense of laxity and paralysis. Cadres wanted to switch shifts and return home to production, and the militia organization was disintegrating. In production, they worried about floods and droughts, were unwilling to cultivate carefully, relied on the weather, and believed in ghosts and gods. The propagandists initially targeted these backward ideological situations and began to work.

    First, the propagandists publicized the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and carried out patriotic education. They closely integrated patriotic education with the land reform review work, mobilized the masses to speak out about their suffering, exposed the criminal conspiracy of the reactionary secret society "Thirteen Taibaos" to organize fake farmers' associations, and at the same time, linked it to the past reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to arm Japan. They denounced the atrocities of the Japanese invaders in Wannian County in the past, in order to stimulate the masses' hatred of imperialism and reactionaries. The propagandists proposed: "After turning over, shoulder the gun, defeat the American wolf, and defend the homeland!" At that time, nineteen young people in the township voluntarily signed up to join the army. After this period of patriotic education, the masses throughout the township generally understood the simple truth of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and 80% of them could explain it to others. On "May Day," more than 1,200 people in the township held demonstrations carrying farm implements such as hoes, rakes, and sickles. The masses' patriotic enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high.

    In terms of production, the propagandists organized the masses throughout the township to overcome natural disasters. In June, a drought occurred, and the masses pessimistically said, "The seedlings are still very small, how long can they last!" The propagandists analyzed the root cause of the masses' thinking and proposed: "Don't rely on luck, don't rely on heaven, prepare well to prevent drought!" "Intensify drought prevention, do a good job in production, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and support the front!" "As long as everyone is willing to work hard and unite, we can overcome the sky!" At that time, the township government organized the masses, established a drought resistance committee for unified leadership, concentrated seventy-three reservoirs throughout the township, and 119 people participated in water lifting. They used gongs as signals and bamboo tubes to drip water to measure time (because there were no clocks and watches locally), and shifted water lifting in shifts, with people taking turns and the water wheels never stopping. Next to the water lifting team, there was a blackboard newspaper that praised and criticized in a timely manner. During breaks, the propagandists read news from the newspapers about victories over droughts in various places to encourage everyone's emotions. Finally, they overcame the drought and saved 1,555 acres of paddy fields. But then a flood occurred. At this time, the propagandists again used the broadcasting station to call on everyone: "Don't disperse the drought resistance preparations, rise up to fight the danger and go to the embankment line! Everyone with one heart, united like one person!" They broke the backward thinking of some people who only cared about their own harvesting and were unwilling to fight the disaster and repair the dikes. Finally, under the leadership of the township government and the promotion of the propagandists, they overcame the flood, so that 5,000 acres of land in the Zhongzhou area was preserved, and even the lake fields, which had been difficult to harvest for decades, also had a bumper harvest.

    After the General Association for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea issued three major calls, the propagandists of Zhongzhou Township exposed the rumors fabricated by reactionary elements, and correctly proposed: "Farmers need farm tools to farm, and the volunteer army needs weapons to fight. We must donate airplanes and cannons to support them!" "Donate early, and the American devils will be defeated early!" "Donate quickly, and the American devils will be defeated early!" Therefore, when the masses' thinking was cleared, the donation movement quickly unfolded, and within two days, the entire township delivered all 15 million yuan of pledged donations to the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea branch.

    In addition, under the impetus of the propagandists, some of the masses in Zhongzhou Township formulated patriotic covenants, effectively carried out the work of tilling land on behalf of military families, breaking superstitions, and learning culture.

    Why can propagandists play these roles?

    (1) Under the leadership of the Party's district committee, the League branch attached importance to and strengthened the regular leadership of the propagandists. The League branch often studied the work of the propagandists, proactively established close contact with the farmers' association and the township government, and adhered to the propagandists' meeting system and learning system. The League organization also often educated the League members who served as propagandists to set an example in order to promote the work of the entire propagandist group.

    (2) Propagandists often study the ideological situation of the masses, concentrate the advanced experience of the masses and specific examples from the masses to educate the masses. They often guide farmers to recall the painful days of the past, compare them with today's life, enlighten the farmers' class hatred and class consciousness, and point out the future prospects and goals of struggle. Facts have proved that the methods of "recollection" and "comparison" are effective ways to educate farmers. When the farmers' awareness is raised and the work is promoted, the propagandists' confidence is also strengthened.

    (3) Propaganda work can be regularized. Since Zhongzhou Township has had propagandists, the League branch has led them to adhere to various systems, thus enabling the work of the propagandists to be regularized. The propagandists have played a significant role in various tasks, and have gradually become an indispensable force for promoting work. Whenever a task is assigned, the propagandists proactively cooperate with the administration, first carry out propaganda, and create favorable conditions for the work. Therefore, the cadres of Zhongzhou Township call the propagandists "pioneers."

    The propagandist work in Zhongzhou Township has become a model for the entire county. And the facts tell us that in places where the Party has not yet established a branch, the League branch, under the direct leadership of the district committee, can assist the Party in establishing and leading the propaganda network.

### 宣传员的宣传工作改变了中洲乡的面貌

　　宣传员的宣传工作改变了中洲乡的面貌
       王云从
    江西省万年县中洲乡自从建立了宣传员以后，宣传员在各项工作中都起了推动和组织作用，使全乡的工作有了迅速的进步。该乡原来是比较落后的，现在已成为一个生气勃勃的先进乡。
    中洲乡共有四个自然村，四百一十六户，一千九百多人，还没有建立党的组织，宣传员的工作是在党的区委的直接领导下通过青年团支部去建立的。全乡二十四名宣传员中有十一个是团员。宣传员按四个自然村分成四个小组，掌握了四座广播台，四块黑板报，七个读报组和一个农村剧团。
    今年四月以前，中洲乡还没有建立宣传员，群众觉悟不高，普遍存在着松劲、麻痹思想，干部想换班回家生产，民兵组织涣散；生产上顾虑水灾、旱灾，不愿精耕细作，靠天吃饭，迷信鬼神。宣传员一开始就针对着这些落后的思想情况展开工作。
    首先，宣传员向群众宣传了抗美援朝，进行了爱国主义教育。使爱国主义教育和土地改革复查工作紧密结合，发动群众诉苦，揭露反动会道门“十三太保”组织假农会的罪恶阴谋，同时，联系蒋匪过去的反动统治，和美帝国主义武装日本的阴谋，控诉从前日寇在万年县的暴行，借以激发群众对帝国主义和反动派的仇恨。宣传员提出：“翻了身，扛起枪，打垮美国狼，卫国保家乡！”当时，全乡就有十九名青年自动报名参军。经过这一段爱国主义教育，全乡群众普遍懂得了抗美援朝的简单道理，其中有百分之八十的人还能讲给别人听。“五一”劳动节全乡有一千二百多人扛着锄头、铁耙、镰刀等农具举行了示威游行。群众爱国主义热情空前高涨。
    在生产方面，宣传员组织全乡群众战胜了自然灾害。六月间发生旱灾，群众悲观失望地说：“禾还小得很，抗得几时去！”宣传员分析了群众思想根源，提出：“不靠运气不靠天，作好准备来防旱！”“加紧防旱，搞好生产，抗美援朝，支援前线！”“只要大家肯努力，团结起来就能战胜天！”当时乡政府把群众组织起来，成立抗旱委员会统一领导，全乡集中了七十三个水库，参加车水的一百一十九人，以打锣为号，用竹筒滴水计时（因为当地无钟表），换班车水，人停车不停。车水队旁边设有黑板报，及时表扬、批评，休息时宣传员就读报上登载的各地战胜旱灾的消息来鼓舞大家的情绪，终于战胜了旱灾，救活了一千五百五十五亩田禾。但是紧接着又发生了水灾，这时候宣传员又利用广播台号召大家：“抗旱准备不要散，起来抢险上圩线！大家一条心，团结象一人！”打破了一部分群众只顾自己抢收，不愿抢险修堤的落后思想，终于在乡政府的领导和宣传员的宣传推动之下，战胜了洪水，使中洲一带五千亩田地得到保全，使几十年来很难丰收的湖田也丰收了。
    抗美援朝总会发出三大号召以后，中洲乡的宣传员揭穿反动分子制造的谣言，正确地提出：“农民作田要农具，志愿军打仗要武器，我们一定要捐献飞机大炮来支援他们！”“捐献送得早，美国鬼子早打倒！”“捐献送得快，美国鬼子就早败！”因此群众思想通了，捐献运动也就很快展开，两天内全乡就把认捐的一千五百万元全部送到抗美援朝分会。
    此外，在宣传员的推动下，中洲乡的一部分群众订了爱国公约，有效地开展了军属代耕，破除迷信，学习文化等工作。
    宣传员为什么能起到这些作用呢？
    （一）在党的区委的领导下，团支部重视和加强了对宣传员的经常领导。团支部经常研究宣传员工作，和农会、乡政府主动取得密切联系，并坚持了宣传员的会议制度和学习制度。团的组织并经常教育担任宣传员的团员，要以身作则来推动整个宣传员的工作。
    （二）宣传员经常研究群众的思想情况，集中群众的先进经验和群众中的具体事例来教育群众。他们经常引导农民回忆过去的痛苦日子，对比今天的生活，启发农民的阶级仇恨和阶级觉悟，并指出将来的前途和奋斗的目标。事实证明，“回忆”和“打比方”这种方式是教育农民的有效方式。农民觉悟提高了，工作推动起来了，宣传员的信心也更加强了。
    （三）宣传工作能经常化。中洲乡自从有了宣传员以后，由于团支部领导他们坚持了各种制度，因而，使宣传员工作能够经常化起来。宣传员在各种工作中起了显著的作用，就逐渐成为推动工作的不可缺少的力量，无论什么任务布置下来时，宣传员就主动配合行政，首先展开宣传，给工作创造了有利的条件，因此，中洲乡的干部们都把宣传员称为“开路先锋”。
    中洲乡的宣传员工作已成为全县的模范。并且事实告诉我们，在党还没有建立支部的地方，团支部在区委的直接领导下是可以协助党建立和领导宣传网工作的。
