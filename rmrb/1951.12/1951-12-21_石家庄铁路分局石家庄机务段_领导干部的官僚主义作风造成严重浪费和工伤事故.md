    Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres Causes Serious Waste and Industrial Accidents

    Editor: Certain leading cadres of the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot, Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau of the Tianjin Railway Administration, have a serious bureaucratic work style. They hinder workers from giving play to their enthusiasm and creativity. On October 24th, Lu Wenjun, the head of the first section, ordered foundry workers to produce 332 heating pipes and 393 flanges within seven days. This production task would normally take two months to complete. Although the workers worked hard overtime, they still extended the time twice. Section Chief Lu decided to implement an assembly line method, but did not give it to the workers for discussion beforehand, only assigned it to the foremen, and set a deadline for implementation the next day. Many foremen said it wouldn't work, but Section Chief Lu did not consider it. After the assembly line method was implemented, the phenomenon of overtime work increased even more. Many workers worked continuously for up to twenty-four hours. The workers called it the "sweatshop assembly line method." When workers raised opinions about overtime work, the foremen said: "This is an order from above, it won't work if you don't complete it!" Due to too much overtime work, industrial accidents continued to occur. Worker Liu En'yuan's hand was injured by a tool, and the tool was also damaged. Foreman Cai Qiuyu said: "It's already good enough that you don't have to pay for the tool, why are you even reporting an industrial injury!" When workers had accidents at work, the director and foremen, in addition to asking them to reflect, also used "labor reform" to punish them. Section Chief Lu also has a serious privileged mentality. The locomotive depot stipulates that people riding bicycles must get off their bikes at the entrance of the depot, but Section Chief Lu does not comply with the regulations. When public security personnel sometimes ask him to comply with the rules, he says: "Who doesn't know me, Section Chief Lu? Who gave you the regulations to tell me to get off my bike?" Afterwards, he also said that he should have political priority. Once, Zhang Ying of the economic accounting work group disagreed with Section Chief Lu on the issue of determining working hours. Zhang Ying took out the "People's Railway Accounting System" to discuss it with him, but he slammed the book down and said: "Good, you're giving me a lesson." In the end, he also asked Zhang Ying to examine his mistakes. The bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the locomotive depot has affected the depot's production efficiency, which cannot be improved. In October, the entire depot wasted more than 650 tons of coal; the affiliated factory workshops had 99 reworked parts, and 36 defective products were indirectly produced; 18 employees in the factory workshops were injured on duty, with 198 days of injury leave.

    石家庄铁路分局石家庄机务段
    领导干部的官僚主义作风造成严重浪费和工伤事故
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局石家庄分局石家庄机务段某些领导干部，有严重的官僚主义作风，他们阻碍工人发挥积极性、创造性。十月二十四日，第一段长卢文俊限翻砂工人在七天内生产三百三十二根暖气管和三百九十三个法兰盘。这个生产任务，在平常需要两个月才能完成。工人们虽然拚命加班生产，但仍两次延长了时间。卢段长决定实行流水作业法，事先并没有交给工人讨论，只向工长们布置了一下，就限定在第二天实行。很多工长都说不行，卢段长也不加考虑。实行了流水作业法以后，更增加了加班加点的现象。许多工人连续工作到二十四小时。工人们都叫它“流汗作业法”。工人对加班的事情提出意见，工长们说：“这是上面的命令，完不成不行！”由于加班加点太多，工伤事故不断发生。工人刘恩元被工具砸伤了手，工具也坏了，工长蔡秋玉说：“不让你赔工具已是好事，还报工伤哪！”工人在工作中出了事故，主任、工长除了叫他们反省外，还用“劳动改造”来罚他们。卢段长还有严重的特权思想。机务段规定，骑车子的人到段门口必须下车，卢段长却不遵守规定。公安人员有时叫他遵守规章，他说：“谁不认识我卢段长，谁给你们规定叫我下车？”事后还说，他应该有政治优先权。有一次，经济核算工作组的张英，在查定工时的问题上，和卢段长的意见不一致，张英拿出“人民铁路的铁路核算制”和他研究，他把书一摔，说：“好，你倒给我上起课来了。”最后，他还要张英检讨错误。机务段领导干部的官僚主义作风，影响了段里的生产效率不能提高。十月份全段机煤浪费六百五十多吨；所属工厂车间返工活有九十九件，间接组出废品三十六件；工厂车间因公负伤的职工有十八人，工伤假一百九十八天。    梁怡石戈    狄翔
