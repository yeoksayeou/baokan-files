    Central Trade Department Stipulates That National Department Stores and Retail Companies
    Reduce Prices to Supply Goods Before the New Year and Spring Festival
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th—In order to meet the needs of the masses during the New Year and Spring Festival, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has stipulated that national department stores and retail companies will reduce prices for five days during the New Year and seven days during the Spring Festival, and this should be done before the New Year and before the Festival. During the price reduction period, the retail price will be sold at a uniform 5% discount (wholesale business will not reduce prices). If cooperatives (limited to the ten major cities) also implement New Year and Festival price reductions for their members, the materials supplied by state-owned trading companies will be priced according to the usual preferential prices, and then further reduced by 2% based on the wholesale listed price. The same price reductions will apply to all minority areas. The price reduction methods for the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions can be determined independently.
