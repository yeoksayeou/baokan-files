The North China Military Region Logistics Department Quartermaster Department
Self-criticism Regarding Losses of State Property from Customized Raincoats

Last year, on December 4th, our department negotiated with private merchants to customize raincoats. Due to a lack of political responsibility and careless work, the state suffered significant property losses.

When accepting the task of producing raincoats, we relied on the higher authorities—the General Logistics Department Quartermaster Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Ministry of Light Industry—holding the view of "passing things down" when encountering problems. Therefore, after accepting the task, we did not conduct thorough research on material standards and actual costs. We believed that the higher authorities and the Ministry of Light Industry had already negotiated with the manufacturers, so there was no need for us to conduct further research. As a result, when private merchants proposed unreasonable material standards and actual costs, we only relayed them to the General Logistics Department Quartermaster Department of the Military Commission. After accepting the task, although we felt the responsibility was unclear, we did not promptly request instructions, and instead assumed that our department was responsible for acceptance and storage.

In this task, our department neither understood the business (technology) nor paid enough attention to detail, demonstrating a serious bureaucratic work style. For example, regarding the fabric dyeing issue, our department's dyeing factory could have solved it, and the dyeing price per bolt would have been 9,000 yuan lower than that of the private merchants. Furthermore, it is common-sense cost calculation that each bolt of Zhongfang cloth could be stretched by about 1.5 yards after dyeing, but we did not pay attention to any of this. In addition, regarding the use of cadres, Qu Jianguo, who was directly responsible for drafting the contract, had no knowledge of this work and was not conscientious; Gao Chong, who was responsible for allocating funds and materials, had unhealthy thoughts, poor character, accepted bribes in disguised forms, and lost his principles on certain issues. This also illustrates the serious bureaucracy in our work.

The above points are sufficient to prove that our department lacked political responsibility in the matter of customizing raincoats, giving unscrupulous merchants opportunities to exploit us, resulting in state losses amounting to as much as 10 billion yuan. Although objectively limited by personnel and technical conditions, the bureaucratic work style of the leadership, the failure to study the business, and the careless approach that led to the huge loss of people's property is a responsibility that our department should bear.

### 华北军区后勤部军需部  关于定制雨衣损失  国家财产的检讨

    关于定制雨衣损失
    国家财产的检讨
    本部去年十二月四日与私商接洽定制雨衣，由于政治责任心差，工作粗枝大叶，致使国家财产遭受巨大损失。
    在接受承办雨衣任务时，我们由于存在着依赖上级——人民革命军事委员会总后勤部军需部和轻工业部的思想，抱着遇事“承上转下”的观点；所以在接受任务后，对于用料标准和实际成本，均未进行周密的研究。认为上级与轻工业部已与厂商议妥，自己不必再去研究。因此，当私商提出不合理的用料标准实际成本时，我们向军事委员会总后勤部军需部仅仅做了转达的工作。在接受任务后，虽曾感到责任不明，但未及时请示，便自以为本部是负验收保管之责。
    本部在此项工作上，既不懂业务（技术），又粗枝大叶，表现了严重的官僚主义作风。如染布问题，本部染厂可以解决，染价每匹并低于私商九千元；每匹中纺布染后可伸长一·五码左右，是很普通的成本计算常识，却都未加注意。另如使用干部，直接负责订立合同的屈建国，对此项工作既无知识，又不认真负责；拨款拨料的高冲，则思想不健康，品质不良，变相受贿，并在某些问题上失掉立场。这也说明了我们工作上的严重官僚主义。
    以上几点，足以证明我部对于定制雨衣问题，缺乏政治责任心，多方给奸商以可乘之机，致造成国家损失竟达一百亿元。在客观方面虽为人材及技术条件所限，但领导方面的官僚主义作风，不钻研业务，马虎从事，使人民财产遭受巨大损失是我部所应担负的责任。
