Severely Punish Corrupt Elements

He Zhanjun Zhang Sizhi

From March 1, 1949, to November 30 of this year, the Beijing People's Court has accepted a total of 537 corruption cases. The occurrence of such cases is not decreasing, but increasing: 110 cases were accepted in the ten months of 1949, 196 cases were accepted throughout 1950, and 231 cases were accepted in the eleven months of 1951. In the past ten months, 351 corrupt officials have been convicted. Seven people with serious crimes were sentenced to death. Even among judicial cadres, incidents of corruption and bribery have occurred. For example, Gu Yushang, a clerk of the Supreme People's Court, impersonated the head of the trial team, swaggered and swindled everywhere, and embezzled 59.6 million yuan in succession (Gu has been sentenced to death). According to statistics, nearly 100 units in Beijing (including central-level) agencies, organizations, and schools have experienced corruption incidents. Most of the incidents occurred in financial departments, accounting for slightly less than 60% of the total; those occurring in political and legal departments accounted for slightly more than 15%; and those occurring in cultural, educational, military, and other departments accounted for 25% in total. Most of the cadres who committed corruption were new cadres (most of whom had worked in the Kuomintang government), accounting for slightly less than 90%. Among the old cadres, some have also committed corruption crimes. In the corruption cases we have accepted in the past ten months, the direct loss of state property due to corruption has reached 1.624 billion yuan. Sun Baozong, a clerk of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Enterprise Company, and Cui Jiaqing, a technician, were ordered to purchase wood in the Northeast. They colluded with private merchants to embezzle 3.7 billion yuan in Northeast currency (both criminals were sentenced to death). Liu Zhenyao, a salesman of the China Department Store Beijing Branch, absconded with 50 million yuan of public funds (he has been arrested and brought to justice). Huo Zenglun and other nine staff members of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government colluded with private merchants to steal public property from inventory and sell it for profit. Preliminary investigations show that they have embezzled more than 10 million yuan. If we do not severely punish these criminals and resolutely launch the anti-corruption struggle, the development of the increase production and practice economy movement will undoubtedly be adversely affected.

The methods used by these criminals to steal state property generally include absconding with funds, misappropriating public funds, forging accounts, altering receipts, accepting bribes, demanding kickbacks, embezzling and stealing, inflating reports and intercepting funds, and colluding with private merchants to sell targets. The main reasons for these crimes are as follows:

First, many cadres who worked in Kuomintang agencies have not yet eradicated the Kuomintang's ideology and work style, and have not yet established a revolutionary outlook on life and a "clean, simple, and revolutionary work style of serving the people" (Common Program, Article 18); or, although they have been revolutionary for many years, they have not been sufficiently tempered politically and ideologically, and cannot withstand the temptation of the corrupt life of the exploiting classes, and have wavered. Yang Zhan'ao, a staff member of the Production Section of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central Government, who participated in the revolution for many years, absconded with 23 million yuan of public funds to travel and engage in prostitution in Shanghai and Suzhou, which is a clear example.

Second, some agencies and organizations have not yet established sound organizational structures and systems for managing the economy, especially accounting systems and inspection systems. This greatly facilitates corrupt officials in stealing state property. The Qinghe Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not even have account books, and Cen Zhendong and others embezzled and wasted 10 million yuan of public funds.

Third, leniency and indulgence towards corrupt elements, and light sentences for serious crimes, make some cadres feel that corruption is not a big deal, and they become even more unscrupulous. For example, Li Jiachen, a cadre of the International News Bureau, abused his power to embezzle 12.85 million yuan of public funds, a serious crime, but was only sentenced to four years in prison (the case will be retried).

How should we fight against these criminal acts and how should we prevent these criminal acts?

First, mobilize all the people to fight against all corrupt acts, and relentlessly expose and denounce illegal elements who undermine national economic construction and engage in corruption and bribery. Comrade Stalin taught us that we should universally "create a spiritual atmosphere among the masses of the people, an atmosphere that excludes the possibility of theft, so that thieves who steal people's property, whether 'happy' or 'unhappy', cannot live and exist." (Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction, Liberation Press Edition) In this regard, we need to do a great deal of education and organization work.

Second, all agencies and organizations, especially financial and economic agencies, should severely correct the view of neglecting state property. Establishing sound accounting systems and inspection systems is an urgent task. The No. 4 Sub-bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau suffered huge losses because the cadre in charge of fine income, Zhao Xikang, misappropriated more than 10 million yuan of public funds to privately purchase stocks due to the lack of a sound system. This should be taken as a lesson.

Third, we should resolutely correct leniency and indulgence towards corrupt elements and light sentences for serious crimes. Some "well-meaning" people defend corrupt elements by saying: "Cadres live too hard! How can they survive on a hundred or so kilograms of millet? When salaries are increased in the future, corruption will naturally disappear!" This statement shows a lack of responsibility for national property and the interests of the people, and is wrong. In addition, some people wrongly cite the maxim of "treating illnesses and saving people" as a basis for light sentences or no sentences for serious crimes. They do not understand that leniency and indulgence cannot cure illnesses or save people. Severely punishing corrupt elements is precisely to prevent other cadres from embarking on the dead end of degeneration. Lenin said: "Not shooting bribe-takers, but giving such a jokingly weak and light sentence, is a shameful act for Communists and revolutionaries." We should keep these profound teachings in mind.

    严厉惩办贪污分子
    贺战军  张思之
    北京市人民法院自一九四九年三月一日起，至今年十一月三十日止，一共受理了五百三十七件贪污案。这类案件的发生不是日趋减少，而是日益增多：一九四九年的十个月中受理了一百一十案，一九五○年全年受理了一百九十六案，而在一九五一年的十一个月中就受理了二百三十一案。最近十个月来，有三百五十一名贪污犯被判了罪。罪行严重、被判处死刑的有七名。甚至在司法干部中也发生贪污受贿事件。如最高人民法院办事员顾裕尚冒充审判组长，四出招摇撞骗，连续贪污五千九百六十万元（顾已被判处死刑）。据统计，北京市（包括中央级）各机关、团体、学校发生贪污事件的单位近一百个。事件发生在财经部门的最多，占总数的百分之六十弱；发生在政法部门的占百分之十五强；发生在文教、军事等部门的共占百分之二十五。干部贪污的以新干部居多（大部分是曾在国民党政府中工作过的人员），占百分之九十弱。在老干部中，也竟有人犯了贪污罪。在我们十个月来受理的贪污案件中，国家财产因贪污而受到的直接损失达十六亿二千四百多万元。北京市人民政府公营企业公司科员孙宝琮、技师崔家庆奉命去东北采购木材，竟勾结私商合谋贪污公款达东北币三十七亿元（两犯均被处死刑）。中国百货公司北京市分公司业务员刘振尧，竟拐带公款五千万元潜逃（已捕获归案）。中央人民政府铁道部总务处职员霍曾纶等九人集体勾结私商，盗取库存公物，变卖得利，先后有好几十次，贪污款额初步查明的有一千多万元。如果我们不严肃地制裁这些罪犯，并坚决地展开反贪污的斗争，那么，增产节约运动的开展无疑将受到不利影响。
    这些罪犯窃取国家财产的方法，一般地是拐款潜逃、挪用公款、伪造账目、涂改单据、收受贿赂、索取回扣、侵占盗卖、浮报截留、勾结私商出卖标的等。产生这些罪行的主要原因，有下列几种：
    第一，许多曾在国民党机关工作的干部还没有根除国民党的思想和作风，尚未建立起革命的人生观和“廉洁的、朴实的、为人民服务的革命工作作风”（共同纲领第十八条）；或者是虽然革命多年，但因政治上思想上锻炼不够，经不起剥削阶级腐化生活的诱惑，发生了动摇。中央公安部生产科科员杨占鳌参加革命多年，竟拐带公款二千三百万元，去上海、苏州一带游山玩水、宿娼嫖妓，就是显明的事例。
    第二，有些机关、团体还没有健全的管理经济的组织机构和一定的制度，首先是会计制度和检查制度。这就大大地便利了贪污犯窃取国家财产。清河镇供销合作社就是因为连账簿都没有，被岑振东等贪污、浪费公款达一千万元。
    第三，对贪污分子姑息放纵，重罪轻判，使一部分干部觉得贪污并没有什么了不起，更加肆无忌惮。如国际新闻局干部李嘉尘利用职权，贪污公款达一千二百八十五万元的严重罪行，仅判了四年徒刑（将重新审判）。
    应该怎样和这些犯罪行为做斗争，怎样防止这些犯罪行为呢？
    第一，发动全体人民和一切贪污行为作斗争，对破坏国家经济建设、贪污受贿的不法分子进行无情的检举，揭发。斯大林同志教导我们：在人民群众中普遍地“造成一种精神的气氛，这种气氛排斥偷盗的可能性，使偷窃人民财物的盗贼，不论‘快乐的’或‘不快乐的’，都不能生活与存在。”（列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设，解放社版）在这一方面，我们需要做巨大的教育工作和组织工作。
    第二，各机关、团体，特别是财政经济机关，应该严厉地纠正轻视国家财产的观点。把会计制度和检查制度健全起来，乃是当前急务。北京市人民政府税务局内四分局就是因为没有健全的制度，而被掌管罚金收入的干部赵锡康挪用了公款一千余万元私购股票，造成国家巨大损失。应该引为教训。
    第三，应该坚决纠正对贪污分子的姑息放纵和重罪轻判。有些“善意”的人替贪污分子这样辩护：“干部生活太苦呀！一百多斤小米怎么能过活呢？将来薪资提高了，贪污现象自然就没有了！”这种说法，是只顾个人利益、对国家财产和人民利益缺乏责任感的表现，是错误的。另外有一些人，错误地引用“治病救人”的格言，作为重罪轻判或不判的根据。他们不懂得：姑息放纵是既不能治病，也不能救人的。严惩贪污分子，则正是为了其他干部不致走上蜕化的死路。列宁这样说：“不把受贿者枪毙，而给了这样开玩笑似的软弱而轻微的判决，这对于共产党人及革命者乃是可耻的行为。”这些深刻的教言，我们应当牢记心头。
