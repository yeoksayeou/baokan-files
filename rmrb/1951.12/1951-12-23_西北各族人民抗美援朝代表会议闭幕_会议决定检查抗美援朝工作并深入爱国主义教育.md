Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 22nd: The Northwest Ethnic Groups People's Resist-America Aid-Korea Representative Conference, lasting seven days, victoriously concluded on the 19th. After summarizing the Resist-America Aid-Korea work in various parts of the Northwest over the past year, the conference, based on Chairman Mao's instructions and combined with the specific conditions of the Northwest, discussed and passed a resolution to continue strengthening the Resist-America Aid-Korea work. The conference also elected the chairman, vice-chairmen, and 121 members of the Northwest Resist-America Aid-Korea General Sub-Committee, formally establishing the Northwest Resist-America Aid-Korea General Sub-Committee.

The conference believes that to ensure the realization of Chairman Mao's instructions, everyone must participate in the patriotic production increase competition movement: workers should strive to improve production technology, save raw materials, reduce waste, improve quality, and increase production; farmers should strive to improve farming methods, promote cooperative mutual aid organizations, and increase yield per unit area; herdsmen should improve breeding methods, prevent livestock epidemics and disasters, and actively develop animal husbandry. The conference also called on everyone to practice strict economy, save money to develop production, resolutely oppose corruption, oppose waste, and cultivate a new social atmosphere of diligence and simplicity.

The conference pointed out that establishing regular and systematic patriotic propaganda and education work, and strengthening the leadership of patriotic pacts, are the keys to carrying out the patriotic production increase and economy movement. The conference decided to launch a general inspection of the Resist-America Aid-Korea work throughout the ethnic groups in the next three months. During this period, all localities should convene Resist-America Aid-Korea representative meetings at the township level to carefully inspect, revise, and formulate patriotic pacts. In rural areas, factories, and mines, patriotic pacts should be formulated and revised according to grassroots production units, and a regular inspection system should be established, gradually working towards inspections and evaluations on a quarterly basis.

In order to strengthen the patriotic education of the people of all ethnic groups, the conference believes that all localities should formulate plans for the Resist-America Aid-Korea work in 1952 while inspecting patriotic pacts. In particular, plans should be made to conduct patriotic education for the people of all ethnic groups, organize several propaganda groups to go deep into various places to carry out propaganda work, and further popularize and deepen patriotic education.

The conference heard reports from Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, on the Resist-America Aid-Korea and the world situation, and from Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee, on the current domestic and Northwest situation and the production increase and economy movement. The conference also heard and approved the summary report of Yang Mingxuan, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Resist-America Aid-Korea General Sub-Committee, on carrying forward the people's patriotic spirit and continuing to strengthen the Resist-America Aid-Korea work. The conference was filled with an atmosphere of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation among all ethnic groups. Before the closing of the conference, representatives of all ethnic groups presented ethnic songs and dances to the conference to celebrate the success of the conference. Zhang Jiafu, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Resist-America Aid-Korea General Sub-Committee, pointed out in his closing speech that representatives of all ethnic groups should use their leading and bridging roles to mobilize and organize the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups to work together to realize Chairman Mao's instructions to the conference: "Further unite the people of all ethnic groups, increase production, practice strict economy, and carry out patriotic propaganda and education work to support the Chinese People's Volunteers."

    西北各族人民抗美援朝代表会议闭幕
    会议决定检查抗美援朝工作并深入爱国主义教育
    【新华社西安二十二日电】西北各族人民抗美援朝代表会议历时七天，已于十九日胜利闭幕。会议在总结了西北各地一年来抗美援朝工作后，根据毛主席的指示，结合西北具体情况，讨论和通过了继续加强抗美援朝工作的决定。会议并选出了西北抗美援朝总分会的主席、副主席和委员等一百二十一人，正式成立了西北抗美援朝总分会。
    会议认为：要保证实现毛主席的指示，必须人人参加爱国增产竞赛运动：工人努力提高生产技术，节省原料，减少废品，提高质量，增加生产；农民努力改进耕作方法，推广合作互助组织，提高单位面积产量；牧民改善饲养方法，防止畜疫灾害，积极发展畜牧事业。会议还号召人人厉行节约，省出钱来发展生产，坚决反对贪污，反对浪费，养成勤劳朴素的新的社会风气。
    会议指出：建立经常而系统的爱国主义的宣传教育工作，加强爱国公约的领导，是开展爱国增产节约运动的关键。会议决定：在最近三个月内，发动各族人民普遍地进行一次抗美援朝工作的大检查。在此时期内，各地应以乡为单位召开抗美援朝代表会议，认真地检查、修改和订立爱国公约。农村、工矿应按基层生产单位订立和修订爱国公约，并建立经常的检查制度，逐渐作到按生产季度进行检查和评比。
    为了加强各族人民的爱国主义教育，会议认为各地应在检查爱国公约同时，制订一九五二年的抗美援朝工作计划。特别要制订向各族人民进行爱国主义教育的计划，组织若干宣传团，深入各地进行宣传工作，进一步地普及和深入爱国主义的教育。
    会议曾听取了西北军政委员会副主席张治中关于抗美援朝与世界形势的报告、西北财政经济委员会副主任贾拓夫关于目前国内及西北形势和增产节约运动的报告。会议还听取和通过了西北抗美援朝总分会筹备委员会主席杨明轩关于发扬人民爱国精神、继续加强抗美援朝工作的总结报告。会议充满了各民族团结、友爱、互助、合作的气氛。在会议闭幕以前，各民族代表纷纷向大会献演本民族的歌舞，庆贺大会的成功。西北抗美援朝总分会副主席张稼夫在致闭幕词时指出：各民族代表应以自己的带头作用和桥梁作用，把广大的各族人民发动和组织起来，共同为实现毛主席给大会的指示：“进一步团结各族人民，增加生产，厉行节约，开展爱国主义的宣传教育工作，以支持中国人民志愿军。”而斗争。
