    Anti-Bureaucracy Exhibition Educated Us
    Hope All Government Staff Visit

    Comrade Editor: The anti-bureaucracy public document exhibition held by the central political and legal departments has greatly educated us. Comrades from our organization participated in the preparation work for the exhibition and also inspected the handling of public documents in our organization during the preparation period. After visiting the exhibition, we conducted further inspections and discovered even more instances of bureaucracy. The exhibition displayed the matter of filing admission tickets; our organization also received many promotional advertisements from state-owned enterprises, which were all registered and numbered according to the procedures for handling official documents. How serious is this bureaucracy!

    Based on the education we received at this exhibition, I hope that every government staff member will visit it, at least those who handle public documents on a daily basis, so that they can conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of bureaucracy in conjunction with the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and thoroughly eliminate all corrupt working styles in the organization.

    反文牍主义展览教育了我们
    希望机关工作人员都去参观
    编辑同志：中央政法部门举办的反文牍主义公文展览会，对我们的教育很大。我们机关的同志参加了展览会的筹备工作，并在筹备期间对本机关公文处理情况进行了检查。参观展览会后，又作了进一步的检查，发现了更多的文牍主义现象。展览会上展出了将入场券归档的事，我们机关曾接到许多公营企业的宣传广告，也都按处理正式公文手续登记、编号了。这是多么严重的文牍主义！
    根据我们在这个展览会上所受到的教育，我希望每个机关工作人员都去参观一下，至少日常处理公文的同志要去看一下，以便结合反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动对文牍主义进行一次普遍深入的检查，彻底肃清机关中一切腐朽的工作作风。
