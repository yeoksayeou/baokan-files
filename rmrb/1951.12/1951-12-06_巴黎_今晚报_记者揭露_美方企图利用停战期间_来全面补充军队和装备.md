Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: Paris "Ce Soir" reporter Pierre Béguin reported from Kaesong on the 5th: The US side's 180-degree turn in its attitude towards the third agenda item reveals the true intentions of the US negotiators. Just days ago, US delegation spokesman Nokes and American newspapers were clamoring that the Korean-Chinese side refused to prohibit the gathering of personnel and supplies in Korea and that the Korean-Chinese side did not allow inspections. Now, after the Korean-Chinese side expanded and elaborated on the original proposal, United Press reporters reported from Panmunjom: The Korean-Chinese side wants to use the method of prohibiting "replenishing new personnel, weapons, and ammunition" to "strangle" the United Nations Army. The US side complained that even new planes were not allowed to be transported in. US negotiator Joye once boasted that he was wholeheartedly hoping to prevent the possibility of a resumption of hostilities. According to his statement, the Korean-Chinese side's hope to prohibit all reinforcements and replenishment of troops and weapons, including aircraft, should make the US side feel infinitely happy. However, judging from the US side's reaction to the Korean-Chinese side's proposal, they obviously hope to use the armistice period to fully replenish all kinds of troops and weapons. The main reason the US side ostensibly opposes the new plan is that the plan affects the "rotation system." They have already announced that two divisions of the National Guard currently in Japan are scheduled to replace the two divisions of troops in Korea. The US side says that they only have seven divisions of troops in Korea. It can be clearly seen that "rotation" has become a convenient term for the Americans, and they can use this term to replenish troops and equipment during the armistice, possibly for the purpose of launching another military adventure.

    巴黎“今晚报”记者揭露
    美方企图利用停战期间
    来全面补充军队和装备
   【新华社五日讯】法国巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌五日自开城报道：美方宣传对第三项议程的态度有了一百八十度的转变，这样就揭露了美方谈判代表的真正意图。几天以前，美方代表团发言人纳科斯和美国报纸还大事叫嚣说，朝中方面不肯禁止在朝鲜集结兵员和物资，朝中方面不允许视察。此刻，在朝中方面把原来的建议加以扩充和阐述以后，合众社记者自板门店报道：朝中方面想用禁止“补充新的兵员、武器和弹药”的办法来“扼杀”联合国陆军。美方抱怨说，连新飞机也不准运入。美方谈判代表乔埃曾大吹大擂说，他一心希望防止恢复敌对行动的可能性，照他这种说法，朝中方面希望禁止关于军队和包括飞机在内的武器的一切增援和补充，应当使美方感到无限高兴。但是，从美方对朝中方面的建议的反应看来，他们显然希望利用停战期间来全面补充一切种类的军队和武器。美方表面上反对新计划的主要理由是这个计划影响了“轮换制”。他们已经宣布，此刻在日本的两师国民警卫队预定将替换在朝鲜的两师军队，美方说他们只有七师军队在朝鲜。可以清楚地看得出来，“轮换”已经成为美国人的一个方便的字眼，他们可以利用这个字眼在停战期间补充军队和装备，目的可能为的是再发动一次军事冒险。
