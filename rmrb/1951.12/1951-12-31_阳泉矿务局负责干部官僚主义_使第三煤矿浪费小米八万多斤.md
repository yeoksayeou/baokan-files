    Yangquan Mining Bureau Responsible Cadres' Bureaucratic Style
    Causes Third Coal Mine to Waste Over 80,000 Jin of Millet

    To the Editor: The bureaucratic work style of responsible cadres at the Yangquan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province has resulted in significant waste at the Third Coal Mine. This mine has two pits, new and old. The new pit was excavated the year before last. Last year, the Mining Bureau decided to concentrate production and abruptly halted production at the well-performing New Third Pit. Over ninety workers spent twenty-four days moving machinery, rails, electrical wiring, etc., from the new pit to the old pit, a distance of over half a kilometer. This involved over two thousand one hundred workdays, equivalent to over 31,500 jin of millet. In May of this year, the old pit developed gas, and the Mining Bureau ordered a halt to production. Subsequently, the Mining Bureau decided to reopen the new pit. Over one hundred workers then moved the machinery, rails, electrical wiring, etc., back to the new pit. This time, it involved over three thousand workdays, equivalent to over 45,000 jin of millet. Furthermore, before the new pit was reopened, the mine continued to pay workers for eleven days despite the lack of work. These items resulted in a waste of over 82,500 jin of millet at this mine. The primary reason for this waste is that the Mining Bureau did not adequately inspect the Third Coal Mine and failed to heed the opinions of the masses, rashly deciding to cease operations at the new pit. This is a serious bureaucratic work style, and the responsible cadres of the Mining Bureau should conduct a self-examination.

    阳泉矿务局负责干部官僚主义
    使第三煤矿浪费小米八万多斤
    编辑同志：山西阳泉矿务局负责干部的官僚主义作风，造成了第三煤矿的很大浪费。这个矿共有新旧两个坑，新坑是前年开掘的。去年，矿务局决定集中生产，突然把生产得很好的新三坑停止了。从新坑到旧坑有一里多路，九十多个工人把新坑的机器、铁轨、电线等搬到旧坑，用了二十四天才搬完、装好，共用二千一百多个工，折合小米三万一千五百多斤。今年五月，旧坑有了煤气，矿务局命令停止生产。接着，矿务局又决定重开新坑。一百多个工人，再把机器、铁轨、电线等搬到新坑，这次共用三千多个工，折合小米四万五千斤。另外，在新坑未开前，因工人没有工作，矿里照发十一天工资。以上几项，使这个矿浪费了小米八万二千五百多斤。这些浪费的主要原因是矿务局对第三煤矿检查得不正确，又不倾听群众的意见，草率决定了新坑的停采。这是严重的官僚主义作风，矿务局负责干部应进行检查。                郁    竹
