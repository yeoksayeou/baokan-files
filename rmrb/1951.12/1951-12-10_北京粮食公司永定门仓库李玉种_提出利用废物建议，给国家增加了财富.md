    Li Yuzhong of Yongdingmen Warehouse of Beijing Grain Company
    Proposes Suggestions for Utilizing Waste, Adding Wealth to the Country
    Comrade Editor: Comrade Li Yuzhong, personnel secretary of the Yongdingmen Warehouse of the Beijing Grain Company, used his brain during the movement to increase production and practice economy and oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and put forward rationalization proposals for utilizing waste materials, saving a great deal of wealth for the country. The Yongdingmen Warehouse of the Beijing Grain Company originally stored 1,675 pieces of scrap sackcloth and sack skin prepared for sale. After Comrade Li Yuzhong discovered these items, he inspected them and believed that they could still be used after some repair. He then made a suggestion to the management. This suggestion was accepted by the management department, and the old sackcloth pieces and sack skin were repaired into 1,339 complete patching sacks. This repair, after deducting the cost of labor and materials, increased the country's wealth by 11,065,280 yuan. I suggest that all state-owned enterprises conduct a detailed inventory of stored waste products during the movement to increase production and practice economy, and use all possible materials.

        Director of Yongdingmen Warehouse, Beijing Grain Company    Li Tinggui
                            Deputy Director    Wang Shiying

    北京粮食公司永定门仓库李玉种
    提出利用废物建议，给国家增加了财富
    编辑同志：北京市粮食公司永定门仓库人事秘书李玉种同志，在增产节约反对贪污、浪费运动中，开动脑筋，提出利用废物的合理化建议，给国家节省了很大一笔财富。北京粮食公司永定门仓库原存准备出售的残废麻袋片和麻袋包皮一千六百七十五条。当李玉种同志发现这些东西后，经过检查，认为整修一下还可以使用，便向管理人员提出建议。这项建议被管理部门接受，把破旧麻袋片和麻袋包皮整修成一千三百三十九条完整的修补袋。这次整修，除去所用工料等费外，给国家增加了一千一百零六万五千二百八十元的财富。我建议各国营企业在增产节约运动中，把储存的废品进行详细清查，使用一切可能使用的物资。
