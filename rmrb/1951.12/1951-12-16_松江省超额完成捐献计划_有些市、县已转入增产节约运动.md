    Songjiang Province Exceeds Donation Plan;
    Some Cities and Counties Have Shifted to Production Increase and Thrift Movement
    [Reported by this newspaper] The people of Songjiang Province have exceeded their donation plan. As of the 4th, the province's payments have reached over 75.6 billion yuan (statistics from two counties are missing), enough to purchase 50 fighter planes, exceeding the original donation plan (71.7 billion yuan) by 5 percent. The payment amounts of some cities and counties far exceeded their original donation plans. For example, Yilan County's payment exceeded its original plan by 74 percent. These cities and counties have concluded their donation work and shifted to the production increase and thrift movement. Other cities and counties are continuing to strive to complete their donation plans. The entire province is striving to conclude the donation work before the end of December and fully shift to the production increase and thrift movement. (Wang Shuangye)
