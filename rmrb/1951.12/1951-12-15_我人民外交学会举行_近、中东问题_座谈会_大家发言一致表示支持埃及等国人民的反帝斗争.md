Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs held a symposium on "Near and Middle East Issues" on the evening of the 13th. The meeting was presided over by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. More than 130 people attended the symposium, including Zhou Gengsheng, Shao Lizi, Hu Yuzhi, Qian Duansheng, Mei Ru'ao, Ji Chaoding, Zhou Peiyuan, Tu Yuntan, Zhang Jiongbo, Liu Zerong, Lei Jieqiong, Huang Yaomian, Liao Mengxing, Qu Wu, Xu Shouxuan, Feng Binfu, Liang Chunfu, Meng Xianzhang, Gao Ji, and Wu Maosun. After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, Ma Jian, a professor at Peking University who had studied in Egypt, briefly introduced the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa. In his speech, he emphasized the encouraging effect of the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the victory of the Chinese revolution, and the victory of the Chinese people's resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea on the Egyptian people and the people of the Near East and Middle East in their struggle for national independence and liberation.

Zhou Gengsheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and an expert in international law, then spoke. After briefly recalling the history of the successive plundering of Egypt by French and British imperialists, he said: The Egyptian people's struggle against British imperialist enslavement is closely related to the entire Near and Middle East issue. This struggle will inevitably promote the struggles of the people of Arab countries, uniting them closely to fight together to overthrow imperialism and achieve national independence and freedom.

Shao Lizi, a director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, pointed out in his speech: The struggle of the people of the Near and Middle East is a just struggle. We Chinese people have unlimited sympathy and concern for the anti-imperialist struggles of all oppressed nations. We fully support the struggles of the people of these countries. The struggle of the Egyptian people is only a beginning, and serious tasks of struggle are placed before the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people must prepare to overcome all difficulties and persevere for a long time. We firmly believe that they will achieve final victory.

Hu Yuzhi and Qian Duansheng, Vice Presidents of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, spoke successively. They unanimously pointed out that the new upsurge of the anti-imperialist movement of the people of the Near and Middle East is taking place at a time when the U.S. and British imperialist war blocs are stepping up preparations for war in the East and West, especially in the Mediterranean and Middle East, attempting to organize the so-called "Middle East Command," turning Middle Eastern countries into bases of aggression, and driving the Middle Eastern people to serve as cannon fodder. Its significance is enormous. This struggle is undoubtedly a serious blow to the imperialist war plan and a contribution to the cause of world people's struggle for peace and democracy. We should take all measures to provide them with assistance, especially introducing the successful experience of China's anti-imperialist struggle and the specific situation of religious freedom in New China. This will more effectively expose imperialist deception and incitement, thereby strengthening the unity of the forces of peace and democracy.

Mei Ru'ao, a member of the World Peace Council, also spoke at the meeting. Mei Ru'ao introduced the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council on the Near East and Middle East.

Finally, Chairman Zhang Xiruo emphasized in his concluding remarks that the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa has strengthened the forces of the world peace and democracy camp. Although the struggle is arduous, the future is bound to be victorious. The Chinese people fully sympathize with and support their just actions.

    我人民外交学会举行“近、中东问题”座谈会
    大家发言一致表示支持埃及等国人民的反帝斗争
    【新华社十四日讯】中国人民外交学会在十三日晚举行“近、中东问题”座谈会。会议由中国人民外交学会会长张奚若主持。参加座谈会的有：周鲠生、邵力子、胡愈之、钱端升、梅汝璈、冀朝鼎、周培源、涂允檀、张絅伯、刘泽荣、雷洁琼、黄药眠、廖梦醒、屈武、徐寿轩、冯宾符、梁纯夫、孟宪章、高集、吴茂荪等一百三十多人。主席宣布开会后，首先由曾经留学埃及的北京大学教授马坚扼要地介绍了近、中东和北非各国人民的反帝斗争概况，他在发言中强调伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和中国革命的胜利以及中国人民抗美援朝的胜利，对于埃及人民和近、中东各国人民争取民族独立解放斗争的鼓舞作用。
    中国人民外交学会副会长、国际法专家周鲠生继起发言，他在简要地回溯法、英帝国主义者相继掠夺埃及的历史后说：埃及人民反对英帝国主义奴役的斗争与整个近、中东问题有密切的关系。这一斗争必然会推动阿拉伯国家人民的斗争，使他们紧密地团结起来，共同为打倒帝国主义，实现民族的独立与自由而斗争。
    中国人民外交学会理事邵力子在发言中指出：近、中东人民的斗争是正义的斗争，我们中国人民对一切被压迫民族的反帝斗争，都寄予无限的同情与关怀。我们完全支持这些国家人民的斗争。埃及人民的斗争还只是一个开端，严重的斗争任务正摆在埃及人民的面前。埃及人民今后还须准备克服一切困难，长期地坚持下去。我们深信他们必将取得最后的胜利。
    中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之、钱端升相继发言，他们一致指出：近、中东人民反帝运动的新高涨，是发生在美英帝国主义战争集团正在东西两方加紧准备战争，特别是在地中海和中东方面企图组织所谓“中东司令部”，把中东各国变为侵略基地，并驱使中东人民充当炮灰的时候，其意义是非常巨大的。这一斗争对帝国主义的战争计划无疑地是一个严重的打击，对世界人民争取和平民主的事业是有贡献的。我们应采取一切方法给他们以援助，特别是介绍中国反对帝国主义斗争的胜利经验以及新中国宗教信仰自由的具体情况。这将更有效地揭穿帝国主义的欺骗宣传和挑拨，从而更加强和平民主力量的团结。
    在会上发言的还有世界和平理事会理事梅汝璈等，梅汝璈介绍了世界和平理事会第二次会议关于近东和中东的决议。
    最后，主席张奚若在总结发言中着重指出：近、中东和北非人民的反帝斗争，增强了世界和平民主阵营的力量，斗争虽然艰苦，但前途必然是胜利的；中国人民完全同情并支持他们的正义行动。
