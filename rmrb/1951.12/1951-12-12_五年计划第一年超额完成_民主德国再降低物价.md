    First Year of the Five-Year Plan Exceeds Target
    East Germany Further Reduces Prices
   [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th] According to a report from the German News Agency in Berlin on the 10th, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Henry Rau, announced at a press conference on the 8th that the German Democratic Republic had decided to further reduce the retail prices of certain goods. Starting from December 8th, the prices of food and industrial products will be reduced by 10 to 79 percent. Meat will be reduced by 25 percent, cheese by 20 percent, fats and oils by 16 percent, beverages by 50 percent, boots and shoes by 30 percent, and light bulbs by 50 percent.
    Deputy Prime Minister Henry Rau pointed out that the reason prices can be reduced is that the working people of the German Democratic Republic have completed and exceeded the economic plan for 1951 (the first year of the Five-Year Plan).
    At the same time, the West German Bonn Parliament recently passed a law allowing unlimited price increases. This law is part of the so-called aid to the arms industry investment law. In addition, in order to enable the development of the war industry, taxes on small businesses and consumers have been increased, and this new law will cause further price increases in the coming days.

    五年计划第一年超额完成
    民主德国再降低物价
   【新华社十一日讯】据电通社柏林十日讯：德意志民主共和国副总理亨利·劳八日在记者招待会上宣布，德意志民主共和国决定再次减低若干货物的零售价格。从十二月八日起，食品和工业品的价格减低百分之十到百分之七十九。肉类减低百分之二十五，乳酪减低百分之二十，油脂减低百分之十六，饮料减低百分之五十，靴鞋减低百分之三十，电灯泡减低百分之五十。
    亨利·劳副总理指出：物价所以能够减低是由于德意志民主共和国的劳动人民已经完成了，并且超额完成了一九五一年（五年计划的第一年）的经济计划。
    与此同时，西德波恩议会在前几天却通过了一项允许物价无限制上涨的法律。这条法律是所谓援助军火工业投资法的一部分。此外，为了使战争工业得以发展，对小企业和消费者所课的税又增加了，这一条新法律又将在今后几天之内引起进一步的物价上涨。
