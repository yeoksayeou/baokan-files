    To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:
    On the occasion of the upcoming New Year 1952, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the working people of the entire Soviet Union on behalf of the Chinese working people. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet working class has achieved remarkable successes in building a communist society, greatly strengthening the confidence of the world's people in defending peace. The Chinese working class is learning from the valuable experience of the Soviet working class, and under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, is victoriously carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country. We are launching a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy to build our motherland and consolidate our national defense to defend peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese working people and the Soviet working people will further consolidate our friendship, giving a powerful guarantee for the victory of the struggle of the people of the world to defend world peace.
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions, December 27, 1951
