When Chairman Kim Tu-bong of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea personally pinned the "Second Class Warrior Honor Medal" on Comrade Sun Yongchang's chest, Comrade Sun Yongchang was so excited that his face turned red, and his eyes were full of tears. In that instant, many things from the past year flashed before his eyes.

He seemed to suddenly see an old Korean woman with swollen red eyes standing before him again. It was back in November of last year, shortly after our Volunteer Army crossed the Yalu River. Comrade Sun Yongchang was serving as the political instructor of the Third Company in a certain unit. He led his entire company in blocking the frenzied northward advance of the enemy, who were attempting to bring the flames of war to our motherland, in the Yuefeng Mountain area. They crawled and rolled forward in the icy mountains and snowy fields, and Comrade Sun Yongchang's cotton coat was already tattered. One day, after driving away the enemy, they stayed in the home of an old woman named Kim. The old woman's son and daughter-in-law had just been killed by the American invading army, and their bloody corpses were still lying in the house. The old woman cried day and night, and her eyes were already swollen and red. When she saw the ragged cotton coat that Sun Yongchang was wearing, she insisted on mending it for him, but how could Comrade Sun Yongchang bear it? The old woman Kim held Comrade Sun Yongchang tightly, sewing stitch by stitch, thread by thread, while recounting the tragic events that had befallen her family. The old woman's hot tears dripped onto Sun Yongchang's chest, and she stroked Sun Yongchang's shoulder with her withered hand, gesturing for him to "take good care of himself and kill more enemies." From then on, the old woman Kim's hopes, like the stitches and threads that mended the cotton coat, were imprinted in Sun Yongchang's heart.

During the arduous defensive battle on the south bank of the Han River, Comrade Sun Yongchang's stomach ailment flared up again. He couldn't eat even a bowl of rice at each meal, and he would vomit soon after eating. His comrades advised him to rest. They only saw his weak body, but they didn't see the patches on his clothes, which were encouraging him and supporting him.

On February 12th, the heroic company (Third Company) led by Comrade Sun Yongchang was holding the beachhead position on the south bank of the Han River, on Hill 350.3. This was the nineteenth day, and the fighting was exceptionally fierce, with enemy artillery shelling them all day long. His stomach ailment also became severe, and he was in so much pain from morning till night that he could hardly stand up straight, but he was still so active. Wherever there was an emergency, he appeared there, inspiring the soldiers' will to kill the enemy. When the enemy desperately launched continuous attacks on their position, he suggested to the company commander that he lead the reserve team to counterattack the enemy from the flanks. However, when he went down the hill to issue orders to the reserve team, he couldn't walk upright, so he had to grit his teeth and roll down the gully. He led his troops to drive back the enemy from the flanks. In that battle, their company repelled seven fierce attacks by half a regiment of the US 1st Cavalry Division, supported by fifty-two tanks and twenty-four aircraft. More than three hundred enemy corpses lay before them. But in the final battle, he was wounded.

Although he returned to the front lines as a second-class disabled soldier, and it was unlikely that he could work on the front lines again, he resolutely requested to return to his unit and continued his work as usual.

When the Second Class Warrior Honor Medal was pinned on his chest, he was thinking:

"My responsibility is not yet over. How many old woman Kims are there still in Korea! The medal is an encouragement for me to work even harder!"

    当勋章挂在他胸前的时候
      若云
    当朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会金枓奉委员长把“二级战士荣誉勋章”亲手挂在孙永昌同志胸前的时候，孙永昌同志兴奋得满面发红，两眼饱含了热泪。在那一霎时，一年来许许多多的事情掠过了他的眼前。
    他仿佛忽然又看到一个双眼红肿的朝鲜老大娘站在他的眼前。那还是去年十一月间，我志愿军刚跨过鸭绿江不久，孙永昌同志在某部三连担任政治指导员。他带领全连在岳风山一带阻击疯狂北犯、企图把战火烧向我们祖国的敌人。他们在冰山雪地里，匍匐滚进，孙永昌同志的棉衣已破烂了。这一天他们赶走了敌人，住在一个姓金的老大娘家里。老大娘的儿子和儿媳被美国侵略军刚刚杀死，血肉模糊的尸体还停放在家里，老大娘日夜哭泣，眼睛已经红肿了。当他看到孙永昌穿的破棉衣时，她一定要给他缝补，孙永昌同志怎么能忍心。金老大娘紧紧地拉着孙永昌同志，一针针，一线线，边缝边叙述她家中悲惨的经过，老大娘的热泪一滴滴洒在孙永昌的胸前，她用枯瘦的手抚摸着孙永昌的肩膀，比划着要他“千万保重身体，多杀敌人”。从此，金老大娘的希望，便像那一针一线缝补的棉衣一样，刻印在孙永昌的心里。
    在汉江南岸艰苦的阻击战中，孙永昌同志的胃病偏偏又发了，每顿吃不到一碗饭，吃过停不多久又吐了出来，同志们劝他休息。同志们只看到他身体弱，那里看出他身上一块块的补丁，在鼓舞着他，在支持着他。
    二月十二日，孙永昌同志率领的英雄连队（三连）坚守在汉江南岸的滩头阵地，三五○·三高地上。这一天已是第十九天了，战斗空前猛烈，敌人炮火一天到晚地轰击。他的胃病也重起来了，从早到晚痛得简直不能直腰，但他仍是那样活跃。那里紧急，他出现在那里，鼓舞着战士们的杀敌意志。当敌人拚命连续围攻他们阵地时，他建议连长，让他带预备队从侧背反击敌人。可是，他下山向预备队下达命令时，他不能直腰走，只得咬着牙滚下山沟，他带领部队从侧背把敌人反击下去。就在这个战斗里，他们的连队打退了敌人五十二辆坦克、二十四架飞机配合下的美军骑一师半个团的七次猛攻，三百多个敌尸摆在了他们的面前。但在最后的战斗中，他负了伤。
    虽然他重返前线时，已经是二等残废，已不大可能再在前线工作。但他坚决要求回到他的部队，照样坚持着他的工作。
    当二级战士荣誉章挂在他胸前的时候，他在想：
    “我的责任还没有完，朝鲜还有多少个金老大娘！勋章是激励我更加努力的！”
