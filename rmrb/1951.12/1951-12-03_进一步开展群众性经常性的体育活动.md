    Further Develop Mass and Regular Sports Activities

    The 1951 National Football Tournament opened in Tianjin on December 1st. This is the second national sports competition since the founding of New China (the first was the National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament held in May this year). Participating in the competition are eight units, including the six major administrative regions of North China, East China, Northeast China, Central South China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese Railway Trade Union. This conference is a sign that the people's sports activities in New China are flourishing.

    Sports are an indispensable part of national construction. Because the broad masses of the people, especially the youth, participate in scientific physical exercise, they can improve their health, develop strong physiques and abundant energy, improve labor efficiency, better carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strengthen national defense forces.

    In the past, during the reactionary rule, sports were only activities for a few people. After liberation, sports activities have been greatly developed under the strong advocacy of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the broad masses of people from all walks of life have gradually realized the importance of sports. However, today, the mass participation and regularity of sports activities are still extremely insufficient and far from meeting the needs of the people and the country. This situation must be actively changed to make sports a regular activity for the broad masses of people and youth. Only in this way can sports play its contribution to the motherland's national defense, production and construction, and the people's health; at the same time, only in this way can the level of sports be continuously improved and excellent sports records appear. Today, it is necessary to resolutely prevent the phenomenon of sports work simply cultivating a few athletes who are detached from the masses.

    At present, the state cannot use a large amount of funds for sports construction. We should use the spirit of combat that does not cost money or costs less money to popularize various sports activities familiar to the masses and military sports activities closely related to national defense among the broad masses in various regions. The recent broadcast calisthenics is the best form of mass sports activity, and everyone can participate; at the same time, in addition to various ball games, there are also track and field, equipment, weightlifting, mountain climbing, shooting, martial arts, rope skipping, shuttlecock kicking, horse riding, skating, etc., which are all good ways to exercise the body. All forms of sports activities should be fully utilized in order to develop mass and regular sports activities.

    进一步开展群众性经常性的体育活动
    一九五一年全国足球比赛大会于十二月一日在天津开幕了。这是新中国诞生以来第二次全国性的体育比赛会（第一次是今年五月举行的全国篮、排球比赛大会）。参加比赛的有华北、华东、东北、中南、西南、西北六大行政区和中国人民解放军、中国铁路工会等八个单位。这次大会是新中国的人民体育活动正日益蓬勃发展的标志。
    体育是国家建设不可缺少的一项事业。因为广大的人民特别是青年参加了科学的体育锻炼，才能改进健康状况，锻炼出坚强的体格和充沛的精力，提高劳动效率，更好地开展增产节约运动，加强国防力量。
    过去反动统治时期的体育只是少数人的活动。解放后，体育活动在共产党和人民政府的大力倡导下已得到极大的发展，各阶层的广大人民逐渐认识到了体育的重要。但是在今天来说，体育活动的群众性和经常性还是极其不够的，还远远赶不上人民和国家的需要，这种情况必须积极加以改变，使体育成为广大人民和青年的经常活动。只有这样，体育才能发挥它对于祖国的国防生产建设和人民健康的贡献；同时，也只有这样，体育的水平才能不断地提高，优秀的运动纪录才会出现。今天必须坚决防止体育工作中单纯培养少数运动选手的脱离群众的现象发生。
    目前，国家尚不可能用大量的经费从事体育建设，我们应当以不花钱或少花钱的战斗的精神，在各种不同地区的广大群众中普及各种各样为群众所熟悉的体育活动和与国防有密切关系的军事性体育活动。最近的广播体操就是一项最好的群众性的体育活动形式，人人都可以参加；同时，除了各种球类以外，还有田径、器械、举重、爬山、射击、国术、跳绳、踢毽子、骑马、滑冰等等都是很好的锻炼体魄的方式。一切体育活动的方式，都应当加以充分利用，以便开展群众性和经常性的体育活动。
