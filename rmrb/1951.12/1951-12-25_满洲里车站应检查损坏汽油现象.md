    Manzhouli Station Should Inspect Damaged Gasoline Phenomenon
    Comrade Editor: The 44,328 kilograms of tractor oil purchased by the China Petroleum Company arrived in Manzhouli, Northeast, on November 6th. Yang Taibai, a weigher from the Manzhouli Station Goods Department of the China Changchun Railway Administration, and Wang Hanwen, the foreman of the oil depot transfer team, were responsible for supervising the receipt and transfer of this batch of gasoline. They did not inspect the oil tankers but poured the oil into three tank cars. The next morning, when customs supervisors inspected, they saw that one of the oil tankers had very little oil, and more than eleven or twelve tons of oil had leaked onto the ground. The supervisors immediately notified Yang Taibai and others. After Yang and the others arrived, they carelessly scooped up more than four tons of oil mixed with dust and dirt and poured it back into the tank car, causing the non-leaked oil inside the car to also deteriorate and become unusable. Afterwards, the station's car inspection section did not pay attention to this matter and even wanted to use the oil sludge from brushing the tank cars to make up for the missing oil. This irresponsible attitude towards the people's property should be investigated.

    满洲里车站应检查损坏汽油现象
    编辑同志：中国石油公司所买的四万四千三百二十八公斤拖拉机油，在十一月六日运抵东北满洲里。这批汽油由中长铁路管理局满洲里车站货物处司磅员杨太百和油库换装工长王汉文负责监收和装换。他们没有检验油车，就把油灌入三辆油槽车内。第二天早晨，海关监管员查验时，看见其中一辆油车储油很少，而地上漏的油有十一、二吨之多。监管员立刻通知杨太百等。杨等来了以后，胡乱地连灰土泥沙盛起了四吨多油，仍灌入油车内，以致使车内没有漏出的机油也变了质，不能应用。事后，车站检车段也没有重视这件事，竟要用刷槽车的油底子来弥补已缺的油量。这种对人民财产不负责任的态度，应该加以检查。    朱宽夫
