Xinhua News Agency Report from Kaesong, December 23rd: According to observations from the December 22nd meeting of the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee, were it not for the urging of the Korean and Chinese side, the US representatives would not be in a hurry to reconvene this subcommittee. Libby said: “Even if we reach an agreement on the Fourth Agenda tomorrow, that fact alone does not mean there will be a swift armistice or that there will be an armistice, as other issues have not progressed!”

It is generally estimated that the insufficient information provided by the US side and the unwillingness to discuss the principle of releasing prisoners of war are clearly tactics to delay the meeting; and the two requests put forward by the US side, to release seriously wounded and sick prisoners of war in advance and to have representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross visit the prisoner-of-war camps, are also excuses used to evade discussion of principles.

The Korean and Chinese side has always believed that the issue of rapidly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice is more important than exchanging prisoner information and sending representatives to visit prisoner-of-war camps. This point of view stems from a truly humanitarian concern for the well-being of the prisoners and their families. In order to make smooth progress in the discussion of the fourth agenda item, the Korean and Chinese side has made another effort and exchanged prisoner information. The information provided by the Korean and Chinese side is complete and sufficient, while the information submitted by the US side is a list of unverifiable names spelled in English, with errors such as blurred handwriting, messy and disordered arrangement of prisoner numbers, and repeated erasures abound. The serious extent of omissions and disordered sequences in the US data can be illustrated by the following example. For example, the prisoner numbers from 706550 to 706800 cannot be found throughout the entire list, while number 706790 appears after number 706489. According to the preliminary examination results of the prisoner data submitted by the US side, a total of 1,456 people are missing. If this information is compared with the prisoner lists sent by the International Committee of the Red Cross over the years, a total of 44,259 people are missing. General Li Xiangchao questioned Libby at the subcommittee meeting on the 22nd, asking where these more than 44,000 prisoners had gone? The other party's answer was vague.

Even though such significant loopholes were discovered in the data submitted by the US side and must be investigated, the Korean and Chinese side still believes that immediately entering into a discussion of principles is an important and pressing issue. There are only four days left in the thirty-day deadline. The American people and prisoners are eager to end the war by Christmas, but the American generals are still using delaying tactics. They will not escape responsibility for their delaying of the negotiations.

### 新华社记者报道  美方闪避讨论释放战俘原则将无法逃脱拖延谈判的责任

    美方闪避讨论释放战俘原则将无法逃脱拖延谈判的责任 【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者报道：从二十二日第四项议程小组委员会的结果观察，如果不是朝中方面的催促，美方代表并不急于使这个小组委员会复会。利比说：“纵使我们明天在第四项议程上达成协议，但仅仅那一事实，并不是就有迅速的停战或就会有了停战，还有别的问题没有得到进展呢！”
    一般人估计，美方所提出的极不充分的资料和不愿讨论释放俘虏的原则，显然是拖延会议的手段；而美方提出的提前释放重伤、重病俘虏及由红十字国际委员会代表访问俘虏营的两个要求，也是用来闪避讨论原则的藉口。
    朝中方面始终认为在停战后迅速释放和遣送全体战俘这个问题，比交换俘虏资料和派代表到俘虏营访问，更为重要。这种观点乃是出于关怀俘虏及其家属们的幸福的真正人道主义。朝中方面为了使第四项议程的讨论获得顺利进展，已经作了再次的努力，交换了俘虏资料。朝中方面所提出的资料是完整的、充分的，美方交来的则是用英文拼写的无法核对的名字，其中字迹模糊、杂乱无章、俘虏号码编排的次序颠倒掉漏、重复涂抹等错误情形，不一而足。美方资料编号掉漏和次序颠倒的严重程度，只要举出下面这个例子就足可说明了。譬如，从七零六五五零至七零六八零零的俘虏编号，找遍全册都找不着，而其中七零六七九零号则在七零六四八九号后边出现了。根据美方交来的俘虏资料的初步检查结果，总计就有一千四百五十六人不知下落。若将这一资料与红十字国际委员会历次送来的俘虏名册核对，则共有四万四千二百五十九人，不知下落。李相朝将军在二十二日的小组委员会上曾质问利比，这四万四千多名俘虏到那里去了？对方的答复却是含糊其词。
    即使在美方交来的资料上，发现了这样重大的漏洞必须追究清楚，但是，朝中方面仍认为立即进入原则的讨论是重要而迫切的问题。现在距离三十天的期限只剩下四天，美国人民及俘虏们渴望着在圣诞节结束战争，而美国将军们却仍在使用着拖延战术。他们对于他们拖延谈判的责任，将是无法逃脱的。
