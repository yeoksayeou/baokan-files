Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 28th. At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 28th, our representative vehemently denounced the other side for insisting on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs under the guise of not increasing military strength. Our representative pointed out that, because the other side repeatedly expressed fear of the growth of our air force strength, our plan of December 24th has clearly stipulated that neither side shall import combat aircraft from outside Korea during the armistice period, and agreed that when either party of the Military Armistice Commission requests an investigation by the neutral nations' Supervisory Commission into incidents violating the armistice agreement, the Supervisory Commission shall be responsible for conducting the investigation. The other side should not use any further pretexts to insist on restricting facilities within Korea and conducting aerial reconnaissance over the entire territory of Korea. In fact, if the other side's purpose is indeed to seek a stable and effective armistice, the other side has no reason to continue to insist on this demand to interfere in our internal affairs, and even less reason to insist on continuing to import military forces and ammunition without restriction from outside Korea under the guise of rotation and replenishment during the armistice period.

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side again refused to determine the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice, under the pretext of requesting further specific materials from our side regarding individual personnel on their side. Our representative pointed out that our side is fully prepared to provide further materials regarding prisoners of war on the other side as much as possible, but the other side must hand over the materials on more than 44,000 of our captured personnel, which the other side has not yet submitted. Under these circumstances, the other side has no reason to use further exchange of prisoner of war materials as a pretext to evade determining the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war.

    在朝鲜谈判两项议程小组委员会上
    我方代表痛斥美方藉口坚持无理要求
    指出对方必须交出四万四千余我方被俘人员的材料
     【新华社开城二十八日电】在二十八日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程小组委员会上，我方代表痛斥对方假借不增加军事力量之名，坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求。我方代表指出：由于对方一再表示畏惧我方空军力量的生长，我方十二月二十四日的方案，已经明确规定双方不得在停战期间，自朝鲜境外输入作战飞机，并同意当军事停战委员会的任何一方向中立国所组成的监察机构提出调查违反停战协议事件的请求时，监察机构即须负责进行调查。对方不应该再用任何藉口坚持限制朝鲜境内的设备，并在朝鲜全境进行空中侦察。事实上如果对方的目的确是在于求得稳定与有效的停战，对方就没有任何理由继续坚持这种干涉我方内政的要求，更没有任何理由坚持在停战期间，在轮换和补充的名义下，继续自朝鲜境外无限制地输入军事力量与武器弹药。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方再次藉口要求我方提供有关对方个别人员的进一步的具体材料，仍然拒绝确定停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则。我方代表指出我方完全准备尽可能地进一步提供有关对方战俘的材料，但对方必须交出四万四千余名我方被俘人员的材料，这种材料对方至今尚未交来。在此种情况下，对方没有任何理由以进一步交换战俘材料为藉口，逃避确定迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则。
