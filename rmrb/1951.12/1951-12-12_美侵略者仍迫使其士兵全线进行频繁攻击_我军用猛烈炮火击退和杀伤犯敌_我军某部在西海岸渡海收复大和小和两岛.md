Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 11th. Our frontline correspondent reports: In recent days, the American aggressors have continued to force their American soldiers and accomplice countries' soldiers, who are eager for a ceasefire, to carry out frequent small-scale attacks along the long and cold front. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, on all positions along the entire front, used the firepower of various artillery pieces and automatic weapons to repel and inflict casualties on the attacking enemy.

	On the eastern front, on the morning of the 3rd, more than 500 enemy soldiers attacked Height 510 east of the Bukhan River twice, but were repelled by the fierce artillery fire of a unit of our army. At 5:00 p.m., an American company attacked Height 1052 north of Yanggu. The defending soldiers of our army bravely counterattacked, inflicted more than 40 casualties on the enemy, and forced them to retreat. Another group of more than 100 enemies attacking a height east of Shisi-ri were bombarded by our army's artillery fire while advancing, resulting in more than 30 deaths. On the 5th, enemy troops successively attacked an unnamed height east of the Bukhan River with forces ranging from a platoon to two platoons, but were also repelled by our army, with the enemy suffering more than 30 casualties. On the same day, two platoons of enemy troops attacked our position east of Shatuo-ri and retreated after suffering heavy casualties.

	In the eastern part of the central front, on the 2nd, an enemy platoon that infiltrated the vicinity of Kimhwa was bombarded by our army's artillery fire, scattering the enemy and forcing them to flee back. On the same day, enemy troops attacked Heights 290, 414.4, and 300 near Kimhwa with one platoon each, but were all repelled by our army's dense firepower. On the 3rd, about 50 enemy soldiers attacked Height 472.7 north of Keho-ri, east of Kimhwa, and fled south after our army inflicted casualties on many of them. On the morning of the 4th, more than 100 enemy soldiers gathered on an unnamed height south of Zuoshou-dong, east of Kimhwa, preparing to attack our army's position. Our army immediately bombarded the area with artillery fire, inflicting casualties on more than half of the enemy. On the morning of the 5th, an enemy company attacked the northeast of Jiaoyan Mountain, the west and northwest of Shuangling-dong, and an unnamed height southeast of Kimhwa; at the same time, an enemy company also attacked our height west of Songshi-ri, but were all repelled by our army, with the enemy suffering dozens of casualties.

	On the western front, on the afternoon of the 3rd, more than 30 enemy infantry, under the cover of two tanks, attacked a certain height west of Tieyuan, but were repelled by our artillery fire. At the same time, more than 20 enemy soldiers infiltrated Shangpu Fangdong Mountain, but were also repelled by our army.

	In order to coordinate their small-scale attacks, the invading army has been shelling our army's positions in various places for days, and our army has also retaliated with artillery in various places.

	Our army launched counterattacks against the invading enemy in local areas. On November 30th, a unit of our army, in coordination with powerful artillery fire, launched a sea-crossing counterattack against the enemy forces on Dahe Island and Xiaohe Island on the west coast. After fighting fiercely until the afternoon of the next day, they annihilated more than 140 enemies occupying the two islands and recovered the two islands. At 11:50 p.m. on the 1st, a unit of our army counterattacked the enemy position seven kilometers northwest of Kimhwa and occupied the area 40 minutes later, annihilating most of two platoons of the defending enemy, the Lee Syngman puppet army's 6th Division. On the 2nd, a unit of our army counterattacked an unnamed height southeast of Height 1211 north of Yanggu, inflicting casualties on more than 30 enemies.

    【新华社朝鲜前线十一日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略者连日仍迫使其渴望停战的美国士兵及帮凶国的士兵沿着漫长而寒冷的战线进行频繁的小规模攻击。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在全线各个阵地上，用各种火炮和自动武器的火力击退和杀伤进攻的敌人。
    在东线，三日晨，五百多个敌军两次进犯北汉江以东五一零高地，都被我军某部猛烈炮火击退。到下午五时，美军一个连又向杨口以北一零五二高地进攻。守卫该地的我军英勇迎击，杀伤敌四十多人后迫敌后退。另一股向石寺里以东高地进犯的一百多个敌人，在前进时遭到我军炮火的轰击，死亡三十多人。五日，敌军先后用一个排到两个排的兵力进犯北汉江以东的一个无名高地，也被我军击退，敌伤亡三十多人。同日，敌军两个排攻击我沙汰里以东阵地，遭到严重杀伤后溃退。
    在中线东部，二日，敌军一个排窜扰到金城附近时，遭我军炮火轰击，打得敌人四散逃回。同日，敌军各以一个排分别进犯金城附近的二九零、四一四点四、三零零等高地，也都被我军密集的火力击退。三日，敌军约五十人进犯到金城以东科湖里以北四七二点七高地，被我杀伤多人后向南逃去。四日晨，敌军一百多人集结在金城以东座首洞以南无名高地，准备向我军阵地进犯。我军立即用炮火轰击该地，敌人被杀伤过半。五日晨，敌一个连分别进犯金城东南轿岩山东北、双岭洞以西及西北无名高地；同时，敌军一个连又攻击我松室里以西高地，都被我军击退，敌伤亡数十人。
    在西线，三日下午，敌军步兵三十多人在两辆战车掩护下向铁原以西某高地进攻，被我炮火击退。同时，敌军二十多人窜犯上浦防东山，也被我击退。
    侵略军为配合其小规模的攻击，在各处连日炮击我军阵地，我军在各处也用大炮还击。
    我军在局部地区向进犯的敌人发起反击。十一月三十日，我军某部在强大炮火配合下，在西海岸渡海反击大和岛、小和岛的敌军，奋战到次日下午，歼侵占该两岛的敌人一百四十多名，收复该两岛。一日夜十一时五十分，我军某部反击金城西北七公里处的敌军阵地，四十分钟后占领该地，歼灭守敌李伪军第六师的两个排大部。二日，我军一部反击侵占杨口以北一二一一高地东南的一个无名高地，杀伤敌三十多人。
