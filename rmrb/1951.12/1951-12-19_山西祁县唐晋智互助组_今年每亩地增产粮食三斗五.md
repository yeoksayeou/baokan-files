The 169 mu of cultivated land of the Tang Jinzhi Mutual Aid Team in Shenling, Qixian County, Shanxi Province, produced a total of 219 shi and 8 dou of grain this year, an increase of 3.5 dou per mu compared to last year. The main reason for the increased production of this mutual aid team is the collective production through organization. This mutual aid team has nine households and fifteen laborers. Under the leadership of Tang Jinzhi, they formulated a production increase plan in the spring according to the season, and then used labor and animal power uniformly according to the number of mu of cultivated land. One full laborer was left to sell labor outside, two half laborers, and four donkeys specialized in sideline transportation. In terms of cultivation, because they paid attention to technology and did more work on the land, the crops grew exceptionally well. The skilled people in the team specialized in plowing, and the wheat fields were plowed four times. All the cultivated land was tilled inside and padded outside, with edges dug and dikes built, with one more hoeing and one more plowing than last year. Last year, when they worked individually, they averaged eleven workdays per mu. This year, organized, they achieved thirteen workdays per mu. The seeds were also treated with medicine soaking and warm water soaking, so they grew fully. As a result, the yield per mu increased by 3.5 dou compared to last year. They paid special attention to intensive cultivation of the 12 mu of land cultivated for military dependents. The expected output of the 12 mu of land was 9 shi, but the actual output was 19 shi and 7 dou, more than double the yield. This autumn, they have accumulated 270 shi of fertilizer for military dependents, ready for use on the land next year. Now, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy, they are planning to expand the sheep and cow herds according to the specific conditions of the mountainous areas to develop animal husbandry, and are striving to engage in transportation this winter.

    山西祁县唐晋智互助组
    今年每亩地增产粮食三斗五
    山西省祁县一区神岭唐晋智互助组的一百六十九亩耕地，今年共产粮食二百十九石八斗，每亩地比去年增产了三斗五。这个互助组所以能增产，主要是因为组织起来集体生产的缘故。这个互助组共九户，有十五个劳动力。他们在唐晋智的领导下，在春天按季节订出增产计划，然后根据耕地亩数统一使用劳畜力，剩余一个全劳力出去卖工，两个半劳力，四头毛驴专搞副业运输。在耕作方面，因为他们讲究技术，又在地上多作了工作，所以庄稼长得分外好。组里有技术的人专门撑犁，麦地耕到四次，全部耕地做到里切外垫，刨边垒堰，比去年多锄多耕各一次；去年他们单干时每亩地平均做十一个工，今年组织起来，在每亩地上做到了十三个工；种子又经过药剂浸拌、温汤浸种，所以充分生长了。结果，每亩地比去年增产了三斗五。他们给军属代耕的十二亩地，特别做到了精耕细作。十二亩地的应产量是九石，结果产了十九石七斗，增产一倍以上。他们在今年秋天已给军属积下二百七十石肥料，准备明年上地用。现在他们为了响应毛主席增加生产，厉行节约的号召，正计划按山地的具体情况扩大羊群和母牛以发展畜牧业，并在今冬努力搞运输。
