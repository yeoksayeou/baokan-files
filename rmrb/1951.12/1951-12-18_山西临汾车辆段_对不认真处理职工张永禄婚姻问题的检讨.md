    Self-Criticism for Not Seriously Addressing Employee Zhang Yonglu's Marital Problems

    To the Editor: The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on November 27th by comrades Zhao Genshan and Jin Xiushan regarding our depot's failure to seriously address employee Zhang Yonglu's marital problems, which led to an injury incident, is correct. After investigation, we realize that the reason for this incident was due to: (1) our insufficient education of Zhang Yonglu in normal times;
    (2) failure to earnestly implement the Marriage Law; (3) holding a "conciliatory" attitude towards Zhang Yonglu's egregious behavior; (4) insufficient concern for employees' family life. We have learned from this incident, launched a heated discussion among employees, and criticized the bad habit of some employees beating their wives. During the discussion, employees also voluntarily donated over 200,000 yuan as living allowances for Duan Aizhen.

    山西临汾车辆段
    对不认真处理职工张永禄婚姻问题的检讨
    编辑同志：十一月二十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载赵艮山、靳秀山同志对我段不认真处理职工张永禄婚姻问题酿成伤人事件的批评，是正确的。经过检查后，我们认识到，这一事件所以发生，是由于：（一）我们平时对张永禄教育不够；
    （二）没有认真地贯彻婚姻法；（三）对张永禄的恶劣行为抱着一种“调和”态度；（四）关心职工家庭生活不够。我们接受了这一事件的教训，在职工中发动了热烈地讨论，并批评了某些职工打骂自己老婆的恶劣习气。在讨论中，职工们还自动捐出了二十多万元，作为段爱贞的生活补助费。
