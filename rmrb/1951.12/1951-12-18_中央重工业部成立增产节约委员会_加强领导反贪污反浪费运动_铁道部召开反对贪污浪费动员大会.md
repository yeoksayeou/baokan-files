    [News from this newspaper] The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government and its subordinate bureaus have universally launched a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In order to lead and deepen this movement effectively, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has decided to form a Production Increase and Economy Committee composed of fifteen people, including Acting Minister He Changgong, Vice Minister Zhong Lin, and Liu Ding. Each industrial bureau (group) and cadre school will establish a branch, and each office, division, and section will establish a central group. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the committee, branches, and groups will designate full-time personnel to form a secretariat separate from their current positions to handle daily organizational work. At the same time, they will organize strong inspection teams to conduct in-depth key inspections in coordination with the mass movement. The Ministry of Heavy Industry issued instructions on launching this movement on the eighth of this month. The instructions pointed out that the purpose of carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is to enhance the political awareness of all staff and workers and strengthen their sense of responsibility and initiative. Therefore, it requires leading cadres at all levels to personally take action, set an example, carry out self-criticism, and boldly mobilize the masses to expose ideas and behaviors of corruption and waste, while also exposing bureaucracy, creating a mass movement. Through concrete examples, it is necessary to educate the masses, raise their awareness, and implement the results of this movement into future long-term production and construction work.

    After the Ministry of Heavy Industry and its subordinate bureaus made mobilization reports to all staff and workers, most of them recognized that carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is the current main political task. While studying the documents, some people have begun to conduct self-examination in connection with their own thinking, and have exposed corrupt elements within the agency, as well as serious waste and bureaucratic styles. Some individuals who have engaged in bribery have confessed to the organization. For example, a technician from the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, after listening to the mobilization report, wrote a report to the leadership, confessing that he had accepted bribes of four million yuan from a foreman in a certain construction project. However, some people still have insufficient understanding of this movement, with various erroneous ideas and resistance emotions. For example, some people believe that there is no corruption in the leading organs. Because these people have these erroneous understandings of the movement, they talk more about other people's affairs in their studies and less about their own thoughts; they talk more about the waste of paper and stationery and less about major waste. In order to correct these erroneous ideas, the Production Increase and Economy Committee of the Ministry of Heavy Industry decided to make another mobilization report and required leading cadres at all levels to personally take the lead in conducting self-criticism to enlighten the masses.

    Xinhua News Agency, seventeenth dispatch: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government convened a mobilization meeting against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the Ministry of Railways organs on the fourteenth, and also held a telephone conference for cadres from various railway system administrations and sub-administrations across the country. Minister Teng Daiyuan made a mobilization report at the meeting. Teng Daiyuan emphasized that if corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are not resolutely eradicated, the production increase and economy movement cannot be carried out smoothly and effectively. He pointed out that acts of corruption and waste, as well as bureaucratic work styles, still exist seriously in the national railway system. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has decided to first launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to lay a solid foundation for carrying out the production increase and economy movement. Teng Daiyuan also pointed out that leading cadres at all levels should personally grasp this movement, formulate specific plans based on local conditions, and quickly mobilize the masses to carry out this movement. Teng Daiyuan strictly criticized various erroneous ideas of not resolutely fighting against, but instead tolerating, acts of corruption and waste at the meeting. He called on railway workers across the country to launch a vigorous and swift struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    中央重工业部成立增产节约委员会
    加强领导反贪污反浪费运动
    铁道部召开反对贪污浪费动员大会
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部及所属各局，已普遍展开了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。重工业部为了有领导地深入展开这个运动，特决定由代部长何长工、副部长锺林、刘鼎等十五人，组成增产节约委员会，各工业局（组）、干部学校成立分会，各厅、司、室成立中心小组；在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动期间，委员会、分会、小组之下指定专人脱离现职组成秘书室办理日常组织工作，同时组织强有力的检查小组，配合群众运动作重点深入检查。重工业部于本月八日发出关于开展这个运动的指示。在指示中指出，开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的目的，在于提高全体工作人员的政治觉悟，加强工作人员的责任心与积极性。因此要求各级领导干部必须亲自动手，以身作则，开展自我批评，放手发动群众，号召大胆地揭发贪污、浪费的思想与行为，同时揭发官僚主义，造成一种群众性的运动；并通过具体事例，教育群众，提高群众觉悟，并将这一运动的成果贯彻到今后长期生产建设工作中去。
    重工业部及所属各局分别在全体职工中作动员报告以后，大部分职工都认识了开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动是当前的主要政治任务。在学习文件中，有些人已开始联系着自己的思想作检讨，并揭发机关内部的贪污分子，揭发严重的浪费现象和官僚主义作风。个别有过受贿行为的人，已向组织上进行了坦白。如钢铁工业局有一个技术人员，听了动员报告以后，便给领导上写了一个报告，坦白他在某一项建设工程中曾接受把头四百万元的贿赂行为。但是，仍有一部分人对于这个运动认识不足，有着各种的错误的思想和抵抗情绪。如有的人认为领导机关没有什么贪污，由于这些人对运动有这些错误认识，所以他们在学习中说人家的事多，联系自己思想的少；说浪费纸张文具的事多，谈大的浪费少。为了纠正这些错误思想，重工业部增产节约委员会决定再作一次动员报告，并要求各级领导干部亲自带头作检讨，启发群众。
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府铁道部在十四日召开铁道部机关反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的动员大会，同时举行了全国铁路系统各管理局、分局干部电话会议。会议由滕代远部长作动员报告。滕代远着重指出：如不坚决铲除贪污、浪费和官僚主义，就不能顺利地有效地开展增产节约运动。他指出贪污、浪费行为和官僚主义作风，在全国铁路系统中仍严重地存在着。因此，铁道部确定首先展开反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的运动，打下开展增产节约运动的巩固基础。滕代远又指出：各级领导干部，应亲自掌握这一运动，根据当地情况，订出具体计划，迅速发动群众，开展这一运动。滕代远在会上严格批判了对贪污、浪费的行为不进行坚决斗争反而容忍的各种错误思想。他号召全国铁路职工，大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地展开反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的斗争。
