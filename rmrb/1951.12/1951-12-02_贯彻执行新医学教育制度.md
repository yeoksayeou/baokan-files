A Brief Commentary on Cultural Life

    Implementing the new medical education system is an important task in China's health construction. It is a key to cultivating a large number of medical and health personnel to develop grassroots health organizations and ensure people's health.
    In the past two years, the promotion of the new medical education system has been successful, but this achievement is not satisfactory, because the new medical system has not been universally adopted. Some people emphasize "regularity" and adopt a passively resistant attitude towards this new system; some health administrative leaders only focus on higher medical education and ignore the development of secondary medical education; some believe that shortening the length of study will greatly reduce the students' level. This understanding is one-sided, and they do not understand that although the length of study has been shortened, the new teaching materials, new teaching organization and teaching methods, and new teaching attitudes will greatly improve the quality of medical education. The achievements made by the China Medical University in Shenyang in adopting the new system are a clear example. The above-mentioned erroneous ideas also show that many medical workers do not understand the current needs of New China, or they still retain the views of the European and American bourgeoisie. They want to run medical schools using so-called "regular" methods that are divorced from reality. This is wrong. The broad masses of the Chinese people urgently need a large number of medical personnel, hoping that they will prevent and eliminate various epidemics, endemic diseases, and common diseases. Therefore, all medical workers should earnestly understand the urgent demands of the masses, strive to promote the new medical education system, and quickly cultivate more medical personnel to meet the needs of the masses.

    贯彻执行新医学教育制度
    推行新医学教育制度，是我国卫生建设事业中的一件重要工作。它是培养大量医药卫生人材，以发展卫生基层组织，保障人民健康的重要关键。
    两年来，新医学教育制度的推行是有成绩的，但是这个成绩是不能令人满意的，因为新医学制度尚未被普遍采用。一部分人强调“正规”，对这个新制度采取消极抵抗的态度；有的卫生行政领导机关，仅仅着眼于高级医学教育，而忽视了中级医学教育的发展；有的认为缩短学习年限，将大大地降低学生的程度。这种认识是带有片面性的，他们不了解：学习年限虽然缩短了，但是新的教材、新的教学组织和教学法，新的教学态度，将使医学教育的质量大大提高。沈阳中国医科大学采取新制度所得到的成绩便是一个明显的例子。上述错误思想也说明，许多医务工作者不了解新中国的目前需要，或者在思想上还残留着欧美资产阶级的观点，他们想用脱离实际的所谓“正规”的方法来办医学校。这是不对的。中国广大人民迫切需要大批的医务人材，希望他们去预防和消灭各种流行病、地方病以及多发病等。因此，全体医务工作者都应该切实了解群众的迫切要求，努力推行新的医学教育制度，迅速培养更多的医务人材，以满足群众的需要。
