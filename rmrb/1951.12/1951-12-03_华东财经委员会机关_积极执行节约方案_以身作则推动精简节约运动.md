Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th: The organs of the East China Military and Political Committee's Financial and Economic Committee, under the personal leadership of the Committee's Director, Zeng Shan, are actively launching a streamlining and savings campaign.

The streamlining and savings work of the committee organs was mobilized relatively early, and a cadre meeting was convened on the 3rd of this month. At the meeting, Zeng Shan pointed out that the organs of the Financial and Economic Committee, by setting an example and first implementing the instructions on streamlining and savings and increasing production and practicing economy, can more forcefully and rapidly promote the streamlining and savings and increased production and economy movement in all financial and economic organs and enterprise departments in the region.

The committee organs' streamlining and savings committee was established on November 20th. Prior to its establishment, all members of the organs went through full deliberation and research, discussed issues such as saving expenses, streamlining institutions, and improving work methods, and formulated a preliminary plan for organ savings. The implementation of this plan will save the organs 20% of the original standard for five items of expenditure, including water, electricity, telephone, public miscellaneous expenses, and temporary special expenses, and 60% of the average actual expenditure in the past four months. In formulating the savings plan, the mass line method was adopted, and all members of the organs conducted research and discussion. First, the general affairs department provided the actual expenditure materials for the past four months, and calculated which expenses exceeded the standard and which expenses were still below the standard according to the standards approved by the finance department. Then everyone conducted inspection and research to find out the reasons, and finally formulated specific savings methods. In the inspection and discussion, the organ personnel focused particularly on public miscellaneous expenses, which accounted for more than half of the expenses for water, electricity, telephone, public miscellaneous expenses, and temporary special expenses, and meticulously proposed realistic savings goals and methods. For example, paper expenses accounted for more than a quarter of the public miscellaneous expenses, so everyone proposed methods such as strictly regulating the number of copies of documents printed, the quality of paper used, and advocating the use of more waste paper. In addition, by paying attention to saving stationery, public property repairs, and other expenses, monthly expenses could be reduced by about 3.8 million yuan. After everyone's research, the plan stipulated an effort target of saving 30% more than the original standard. For other expenses, such as temporary special expenses, which were already lower than the standard, it was found that if cigarettes were not served at meetings, more than 500,000 yuan could be saved each month, so everyone stipulated an effort target of saving 50% more than the original standard. In addition, in response to the phenomena discovered in the inspection, such as not cherishing public property, arbitrarily discarding old items and replacing them with new ones, using electric stoves privately, privately replacing large light bulbs, and not turning off water taps and lights at any time, the savings plan stipulated practical and feasible specific methods.

The savings work of the East China Financial and Economic Committee organs, due to the personal involvement of the responsible persons of the organs and the early mobilization, has now mobilized all members of the organs to actively implement the savings plan. Cooks and workers carefully studied the water consumption in the kitchen and when cleaning the rooms, and nannies also discussed how to save water and electricity in the dormitory. Workers automatically used waste paper to make envelopes. The general affairs section cleaned out many unused old stationery and paper. At present, in addition to implementing the savings plan, the organs are continuing to streamline institutions, study ways to improve work methods and the use of houses and cars, so as to gain experience in a timely manner and promote the streamlining and savings movement in other financial and economic organs and enterprise departments.

    华东财经委员会机关
    积极执行节约方案
    以身作则推动精简节约运动
    【新华社上海二十五日电】华东军政委员会财政经济委员会机关，在该会主任曾山亲自领导下，积极开展精简节约运动。
    该会机关的精简节约工作动员较早，本月三日便召开了干部大会。曾山在会上指出：财政经济委员会机关以身作则，首先贯彻执行精简节约和增产节约的指示，可以更有力、更迅速地推动全区各财政经济机关和企业部门的精简节约和增产节约运动。
    该会机关精简节约委员会已在十一月二十日成立。在成立以前，机关全体人员经过了充分的酝酿研究，讨论了节约开支、精简机构、改进工作方法等问题，订出了机关节约的初步方案。这一方案的实行，将使机关的水、电、电话、公杂费和临时特别费等五项开支比原定标准节省百分之二十，比过去四个月的平均实际开支节省百分之六十。拟订节约方案时，采取了走群众路线的方法，全机关人员进行了研究讨论。首先，总务部门提供过去四个月的实际开支材料，以财政部门核准的标准，计算那些开支超过标准，那些开支还低于标准。然后大家进行检查和研究，找出原因，最后订出具体节约办法。机关人员在检查讨论中，特别以水、电、电话、公杂费和临时特别费等项开支中占半数以上的公杂费为重点，精打细算地提出各项实事求是的节约目标和办法。如公杂费用中，纸张的开支占四分之一以上，大家就提出严格规定文件的打印份数、用纸质量和提倡多用废纸等办法。再加上注意节约文具、公物修配等费用，每月就可减少开支约三百八十多万元。经过大家这样研究后，在方案中就规定了比原标准节约百分之三十的努力目标。其他费用，如临时特别费的开支原已比标准低，但如实行开会不招待香烟，每月可节省五十多万元，于是大家就规定了比原标准节省百分之五十的努力目标。此外，大家还针对检查中所发现的不爱护公物、随便弃旧换新、私用电炉、私换大灯泡、不随时关水龙头和电灯等浪费现象，在节约方案中规定了切实可行的具体办法。
    华东财政经济委员会机关的节约工作，由于该机关负责人亲自动手和动员较早，现在机关的全体人员都已行动起来，积极贯彻执行节约方案。炊事员、工友们都仔细研究伙房和打扫房舍的用水量，褓姆们也座谈如何节约宿舍水电。工友们自动利用废纸糊信封。总务科清理出了许多废置不用的旧文具、纸张。目前，该机关除执行节约方案外，正继续进行精简机构，研究改善工作方法和使用房屋、汽车的办法，以便及时取得经验，推动其他财经机关和企业部门的精简节约运动。
