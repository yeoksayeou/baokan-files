    Bengbu Medical Personnel
    Achieve Results in Ideological Remolding Study
    Editor: The Bengbu Medical Workers' Union has conducted political and ideological education for local medical workers and has achieved certain results. The ideological situation of medical workers in Bengbu was quite complex. Medical workers here had many factions and differing opinions. There was discrimination and mutual attacks between Chinese and Western medicine. Many doctors had strong purely technical viewpoints and ideas of being "above politics" and "above class." After the establishment of the Medical Workers' Union, it opened a workers' spare-time school in the first half of this year, mobilizing 343 medical workers to participate in learning, and systematically conducted political education and professional education for them.
    Through learning, the medical workers' political understanding has been greatly improved. They have basically eliminated erroneous ideas such as "above politics," "above class," and purely technical viewpoints. They have realized that technology cannot be separated from politics and should serve the people. An elderly doctor of traditional Chinese medicine said: "I have been a doctor all my life, only knowing how to prescribe medicine and ask for money. Now, I realize that traditional Chinese medicine should move towards a scientific path to better serve the people." In the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they formulated patriotic pacts, enthusiastically donated, and established measures to give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. When the summer epidemic prevention injection work began this summer, Western medicine proposed the slogan of "guaranteeing to teach Chinese medicine injection methods." The city's Chinese medicine practitioners organized an epidemic prevention brigade, enabling the city's cholera prevention injection work to be completed in four days. Due to the improvement of political understanding, Chinese and Western medicine have united. They have created collective diagnosis and Chinese-Western medicine consultation methods, thereby improving their medical technology and raising their professional level.

    蚌埠市医务人员
    进行思想改造学习收到效果
    编辑同志：蚌埠市医务工会对当地的医务工作者进行政治思想教育，已取得一定成绩。蚌埠市医务工作者的思想情况，本来是相当复杂的。这里的医务工作者派别多，意见分歧；中、西医之间，彼此歧视，相互攻击；许多医师的单纯技术观点和“超政治”、“超阶级”的思想很浓厚。医务工会成立后，在今年上半年开办了一所职工业余学校，动员了三百四十三个医务工作人员参加学习，系统地向他们进行了政治教育和业务教育。
    通过学习，医务工作人员的政治认识大大地提高了。基本上清除了“超政治”、“超阶级”、单纯技术观点等错误思想；认识了技术是不能脱离政治的，它应该为人民服务。有一位年老的中医说：“我当了一辈子医生，只知道开方子，要钱；现在，我认识到中医应该走向科学化的道路，更好地为人民服务。”在抗美援朝的爱国运动中，他们订立了爱国公约，踊跃捐献，并且定出了优待烈属、军属的办法。今夏防疫注射工作开始时，西医提出“保证教会中医注射方法”的口号。全市中医组织了防疫大队，使全市霍乱预防注射工作在四天内完成。由于政治认识的提高，中医和西医团结起来了。他们创立了集体诊断和中西医会诊等办法，因此也就改进了自己的医疗技术，提高了业务水平。
