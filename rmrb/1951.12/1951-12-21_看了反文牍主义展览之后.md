    After Seeing the Anti-Bureaucracy Exhibition
      Xie Juezai
    At the anti-bureaucracy exhibition in the central political and legal departments, misdirected documents are called "kicking the ball." In fact, official document journeys are also kicking the ball, kicking it back and forth. In order to show that someone has "kicked" it, they sign the ball (official document), filling it with ink; and some people are required to serve the "kick," with the job title of receiver and sender. In addition to general external and internal receivers and senders, there are also division receivers and senders, section receivers and senders, or receivers and senders with other names. Receivers and senders do not sign the ball, they have a separate book to record it. Someone calculated that a document has to be "kicked" at least thirty times from the time it comes in to the time it goes out.

    Our bureaucrats sometimes feel that the "field" is too small and want to kick the ball to another agency. This is not simple, it requires preparing an official document. After going through drafting, reviewing, signing, copying, proofreading, stamping, registration and other procedures to kick it out, naturally there are also people familiar with the ball game there, who kick it back according to the same procedures, ignoring the modern telephones already on their desks.

    Two adjacent counties in two large administrative regions need to discuss some simple matters, which could have been done by writing a letter, or if there was a telephone line, by making a phone call. They don't do this, but instead make it into an official document (ball), kick it to the province, the province kicks it to the large administrative region, the large administrative region kicks it to the central government, the central government kicks it to another large administrative region, another large administrative region kicks it to another province, another province kicks it to another county, where the situation is inquired about, and then according to the procedures, it is kicked back along the original route. Such things, although "individual," are unfortunately not very
    "individual."

    Bureaucrats also have a characteristic: in the city, they look down on modern telephones; as soon as they leave the city, they complain that the postal service is backward and want to use modern telegrams. It doesn't matter if a document is delayed for dozens of days or months, but when they finally get it done, they not only have to send a telegram, but also mark it "urgent" or "express." The telegrams are never concise, they don't seem to know that telegrams are charged by the word, and urgent telegrams cost twice as much, anyway, it has nothing to do with them.

    Suppose a worker in an agency works eight hours a day and spends four hours on such "ball-kicking" procedures, and suppose this worker, if engaged in constructive work, generates a minimum value of 5,000 yuan per hour, then the loss per day would be 20,000 yuan. If there are 100,000 such workers in the country (probably more than this number), then the loss per day would be 2 billion yuan, and the loss per year would be a lot. The savings could be used to buy many machines or airplanes.

    The paper, pens, and ink consumed by bureaucrats are also not a small amount, especially the cost of sending telegrams. If those savable figures are calculated, I don't know how many more machines or airplanes could be bought.

    Useful agency publications should be published. Some publications are published for the sake of publishing, and a collection of newspapers, essays, and already issued documents is one issue. No one buys them, they are given away; those who receive them often don't open them. In a time when the people need cultural nourishment and paper and printing are lacking, doing this should not be allowed.

    This is one aspect.

    On the other hand, isn't everyone on various construction fronts now shouting about the lack of talent? We are putting some cultured or experienced people who can be trained into the pit of bureaucracy, which is a great waste.

    Some people say: I am too busy here to streamline. Yes, it is very busy. But part of it is busy "kicking the ball," and sometimes they don't know where it has been "kicked," and they have to rush to find it. Others say: If there are fewer people and less spending, work efficiency will decrease. But you must know that more people, more levels, more procedures, and more spending cause people to be unclear in their minds, which is precisely one of the reasons for low work efficiency.

    Bureaucracy and streamlining and saving are incompatible. It is hoped that an anti-bureaucracy movement will be launched simultaneously with the streamlining and saving movement.

    看了反文牍主义展览之后
      谢觉哉
    在中央政法部门的反文牍主义展览会上，称错送文件为“踢皮球”。实则公文旅行也是踢皮球，踢过来，踢过去。为了表示某人已经“踢”过，在皮球（公文）上签个字，签得满黑的；还要些人伺候“踢”，职名叫收发。除一般的外收发、内收发之外，还有司收发、科收发、或其他名义的收发。收发不在皮球上签字，他们另外有个本本记载。有人计算：一个文件从进来到出去，至少要“踢”三十次。
    我们的文牍主义者有时嫌“球场”小了，要把球踢到另一个机关去。这可不简单，要备公文。经过起稿、核稿、签发、誊写、校对、盖章、登记等手续踢出去，自然那里也有熟悉球艺的人，依照同样的手续把它踢回来，他们放着已有的放在桌上的现代化的电话机不用。
    两个大行政区相邻的县，有些简单事要商量，本来可以写个信，如有电话线，打个电话就得。他们不这样，却把它制成公文（球），踢到省，省踢到大行政区，大行政区踢到中央，中央再踢到另一大行政区，另一大行政区踢到另一省，另一省踢到另一县，在那里问了情况，然后依照手续，照原路踢回来。这样的事，虽然是“个别”，但可惜并不很
    “个别”。
    文牍主义者还有个特点，在本城内，看不起现代化的电话机；一出城，就嫌邮递落后，要用现代化的电报。一件文件压几十天或几个月不算回事，等到他办好了，那不仅要打电报，还要“急”或“加急”。电文又绝不简洁，他们似乎不知道电报要按字算钱，急电要加倍的钱，反正和他们无关。
    假定一个机关工作者每天八小时工作，在这样“踢球”的手续上花了四小时，又假定这一工作人员若去搞建设性的工作，每小时最低产生五千元的价值，那末，一天要损失二万元。全国若有十万个这样的工作者（恐不止此数），那末，一天就要损失二十亿元，一年就损失很多，节约下来就可买很多机器或者飞机。
    文牍主义者消耗的纸张笔墨，也不是一个小数，尤其是打电报的费用。如果把那些可以节约的数字计算出来，不知道又可以买多少机器或者飞机。
    有作用的机关刊物是应该出的。有些刊物则是为出而出，把报纸论文已印发的文件汇集起来就是一期。没人买，赠送；受赠送的也常不打开看。在人民需要文化食粮，纸张印刷又缺乏的今天，这样做，是不应当允许的。
    这是一个方面。
    另外一个方面，现在不是各个建设战线上都喊人才缺乏吗？我们却把一些有文化或经验、可造就的人，放在文牍主义的坑里，这是一件很大浪费的事。
    有人说：我这里工作忙，精简不得。是的，是很忙。但有一部分是忙于“踢皮球”，有时不知“踢”到那处了，还得忙着去找。又有人说：人少了，花费少了，工作效率会降低。但要知道人多了，层次多，手续多，花费多，弄得人头脑不清醒，恰恰是工作效率不高的原因之一。
    文牍主义和精简节约，是不相容的。希望在精简节约运动中同时展开反文牍主义的运动。
