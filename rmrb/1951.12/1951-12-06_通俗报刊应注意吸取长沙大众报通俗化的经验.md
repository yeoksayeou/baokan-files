    Popular Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Drawing on the Popularization Experience of Changsha Mass Newspaper
    Editor: After reading the article "Introduction to the Experience of Changsha Mass Newspaper, a Popular Newspaper" published in the People's Daily on April 15th, I have constantly paid attention to reading Changsha Mass Newspaper in order to draw on the experience of running a popular newspaper to improve our work. After a period of reading, it helped us solve a problem. This is a problem that exists in the current affairs news section: should it focus on news reports or current affairs explanations? If it focuses on current affairs news reports, farmers are not accustomed to this kind of fragmented reporting without beginning or end; if it focuses on current affairs explanations (speeches, explanations, etc.), it will take up a lot of space and may even miss some important news. The Changsha Mass Newspaper adopted a combination of the two methods, which initially solved this problem. For example, the article "The People's Government's Planes Did Three Major Things for Farmers" on the fourth page of the July 9th issue is only a little over six hundred words long, but it not only explained the three major things, but also pointed out how two essentially different governments treat farmers differently with airplanes. Therefore, for popular newspapers, this is a news format worthy of promotion and development. In addition, the newspaper has also been relatively successful in strengthening ideological content and using mass language. It is hoped that popular newspapers in various regions will pay attention to drawing on the popularization experience of Changsha Mass Newspaper to better run popular newspapers. Tang Xiyang

### 通俗报刊应注意吸取长沙大众报通俗化的经验

    通俗报刊应注意吸取
    长沙大众报通俗化的经验
    编辑同志：我阅读了四月十五日人民日报所载“通俗报纸长沙大众报经验介绍”一文后，就经常不断地注意阅读长沙大众报，以吸取办通俗报纸的经验，来改进我们的工作。经过一个时期的阅读，帮助我们解决了一个问题。这就是时事新闻版中存在的一个问题，以新闻报道为主呢，还是以时事解说为主呢？如以时事新闻报道为主，农民又不习惯于这种有头无尾的零碎报道法；如以时事解说为主
    （讲话、解说等），则又占去很多篇幅，甚至会遗漏一些重要新闻。长沙大众报采用两者相结合的方法，就初步解决了这一问题。如该报七月九日第四版“人民政府的飞机帮农民做了三件大事”一文，只不过短短六百多字，不仅说明了那三件大事，并且指明了两种本质不同的政府是怎样不同地用飞机来对待农民。所以，在通俗报刊来说，这是一种值得提倡和发展的新闻形式。另外，该报在加强思想性和运用群众语言上，也是做得比较有成效的。希望各地通俗报刊注意吸取长沙大众报通俗化的经验，更好地办好通俗报刊。    唐锡阳
