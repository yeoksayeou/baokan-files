China Department Store Beijing Company

Poor Management Leads to Blind Stockpiling of Goods

After inspection by higher authorities, the "supply system mentality" is now being corrected.

At the end of September, the state-owned China Department Store conducted a spot check of the warehouses of its Beijing Company and discovered a very serious phenomenon of stockpiling. The value of goods purchased in 1949 and 1950 alone that were still stockpiled in the warehouses was 5.96683 billion yuan. The leading cadres of the Beijing Company usually do not understand their own assets, do not calculate capital turnover, and do not treat seasonal, fast-selling, and slow-selling goods differently, nor do they appropriately control inventory. They do not pay attention to studying daily inventory reports, always believing that industrial products are insufficient, that it is easy to sell off inventory, and difficult to buy more. They believe that they cannot control prices if they have too little inventory. When formulating the sales plan for the fourth quarter of this year, they did not include the actual inventory at the end of the third quarter, but only planned to purchase as much as they planned to sell. During the peak sales season of the fourth quarter, the Beijing Company still purchased more than it sold. In the sales plan, some major materials could have been sold more, and there was a lot of inventory, so they should have been sold more, but the plan was made too small. For example, 30,000 boxes of glass could have been sold, but the plan only called for 20,000 boxes. Also, goods that had to be sold out of inventory and this season's purchases during this peak season were not sold out. In operation, they only focused on completing the sales amount task, regardless of the specific sales situation of the goods; leading cadres only knew how much money was sold in total, but did not know what was sold. They also did not care about the accumulation of miscellaneous goods. They believe: buying and selling is for the public, if they can sell it, they will sell it; if they can't sell it, they will send it to the warehouse, anyway, they didn't embezzle it; the main materials belong to the head office, it doesn't matter if they occupy more materials; the number of occupied miscellaneous goods is not large, the amount of money occupied is not large, it doesn't matter if they are not sold. Of the 5.96683 billion yuan worth of goods purchased by the Beijing Company in 1949 and 1950 now in stock, 5.27 billion yuan worth of stockpiled goods could have been sold but were not vigorously promoted. Hundreds of kinds of goods, such as 135 boxes of "Era" double-sided carbon paper, 5,120 "Yongzi 32" erasers, 90 tubes of "Triangle" stencil paper, and 860 sticks of ink purchased in 1949, can be sold at any time.

After this inspection, everyone clearly realized ideologically that to overcome blindness in operation, it is necessary to correct the "supply system mentality" in operation and management, keep accounts frequently, clarify assets, appropriately control inventory in a planned way, expand sales in a planned way, and replenish goods in a planned way.

Now the leading cadres of the Beijing Department Store have begun to change their past practices, and have begun to achieve results in expanding sales and improving operation and management, but they should continue to work hard to thoroughly eliminate the "supply system mentality" and lay the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system next year.

    中国百货公司北京市公司
    不会经营管理盲目积压商品
    经过上级抽查，“供给制思想”现已开始纠正。
    国营中国百货公司九月底抽查所属北京市公司仓库，发现北京市公司积压商品现象非常严重，仓库中仅一九四九年和一九五○年买进而现在仍积压着的商品就值五十九亿六千六百八十三万元。北京市公司的领导干部，平日不了解自己的家当，不计算资金周转，不能根据生产、消费的季节性以及顺销滞销商品分别对待，适当掌握库存。他们对库存日报不注意研究，总认为工业品不足，存货销出是容易的，再买进来是不易的，库存少了无法掌握物价。在制订今年第四季度进销计划的时候，也不把第三季度末实有库存计划在内，只是计划销多少就进多少。在第四季度的旺销季节，北京市公司还是进货大于销货。在销货计划上，有些主要物资本来能够多卖，还有库存多，应该多销的，但计划做小了。如玻璃是可以销三万箱的，计划却只订了两万箱。还有是在这个旺季必须把库存和本季进货都应卖完的而不把它卖完。在经营上，只着重完成销货金额任务，而不管具体商品推销情况；领导干部只知道一共卖了多少钱，但不知道卖了些什么。他们对零星商品的积压也不关心。他们认为：买卖是公家的，能卖就卖掉；卖不了，送进仓库，反正又没贪污；主要物资是总公司的，多占压些物资没有关系；占压的零星商品数目不大，压钱数不大，没卖掉，没什么关系。北京市公司现在库存一九四九年、一九五○年买进的价值五十九亿六千六百八十三万元的货物中，有价值五十二亿七千万元的积货是能销售而没有尽力推销的。像库存一九四九年买进的“时代”双面复写纸一百三十五盒、“永字三十二”的橡皮五千一百二十块、“三角”腊纸九十筒、墨八百六十块等数百种货物都是随时可以推销的。
    经过这次检查，大家在思想上明确地认识了：要克服经营上的盲目性，必须纠正经营管理上的“供给制思想”，经常算账，弄清家当，有计划地适当掌握库存，有计划地扩大推销，有计划地补进商品。
    现在北京百货公司领导干部已开始转变了过去的作法，在扩大推销和改善经营管理上已开始收到成效，但还应继续努力，彻底肃清“供给制思想”，给明年实行经济核算制打下基础。（冬）
