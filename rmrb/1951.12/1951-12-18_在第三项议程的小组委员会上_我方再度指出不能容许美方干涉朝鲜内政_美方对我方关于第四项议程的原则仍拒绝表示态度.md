Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th. Because the other side in the Korean armistice negotiations continued to insist on its unreasonable proposals and demands in the two subcommittees on the third and fourth agenda items, the meeting on the 17th failed to make any progress. In the subcommittee on the third agenda item, our representative reiterated that our side absolutely cannot allow the other side to interfere in our internal affairs, restrict equipment within Korea, and conduct inspections throughout Korea. In our proposal on December 14th, we reasonably accommodated the other side's request regarding the rotation of military personnel, agreeing to rotate 5,000 military personnel per month during the armistice period. However, the other side insisted on its claim to interfere in our internal affairs and insisted on unlimited rotation of military personnel and replenishment of weapons and ammunition during the armistice period. In the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, our representative once again requested the other side to express its position on the principles we put forward on December 11th regarding the rapid release and repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice, and suggested that once the principles are determined, both sides immediately exchange all relevant materials on all prisoners of war. However, the other side still refused to express its position. Therefore, both subcommittees on the 17th failed to make any progress.

    在第三项议程的小组委员会上
    我方再度指出不能容许美方干涉朝鲜内政
    美方对我方关于第四项议程的原则仍拒绝表示态度
    【新华社开城十七日电】由于朝鲜停战谈判的对方在第三项议程与第四项议程的两个小组委员会上继续坚持其无理建议与要求，十七日的会议未能获得任何进展。在第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表再度指出我方绝对不能容许对方干涉我内政，限制朝鲜境内的设备，并在朝鲜全境进行视察，我方在十二月十四日的提案中，合理地照顾了对方关于轮换军事人员的要求，同意在停战期间每月轮换军事人员五千人，但对方却坚持其干涉我内政的主张，并坚持在停战期间无限制地进行军事人员的轮换与武器弹药的补充。在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表再度要求对方对我方在十二月十一日提出的停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则表示态度，并建议原则一经确定后，双方立即交换所有有关全体战俘的材料。但对方却仍然拒绝表示态度。十七日的两个小组委员会因而均未能获得任何进展。
