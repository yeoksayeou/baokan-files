    Seriously Promote Li Xikui's Advanced Shunting Method

    The new shunting method created by the Li Xikui shunting team increases shunting efficiency by more than 60%, accumulating a large amount of wealth for the country. This advanced working experience is worthy of attention and promotion.

    In order to improve station technical operations, unleash the potential of railway transportation, and strive to overfulfill the state transportation tasks, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government instructed all railway administrations across the country in August this year to vigorously promote the Li Xikui shunting method. This instruction from the Ministry of Railways has attracted the attention of transportation workers across the country. Major stations across the country have successively begun to study, focus on trial implementation, and fully implement this advanced working experience throughout the station. The results of learning and applying the Li Xikui shunting method at various stations have universally improved the shunting work efficiency of each station; this has accelerated vehicle turnaround time and ensured the completion of more state transportation tasks with existing vehicles and equipment. Experience has proven that whichever railway administration or station has attached importance to and earnestly implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, the shunting work efficiency there has improved, and the transportation tasks have been completed or overfulfilled. Conversely, the shunting work efficiency has not improved significantly, and the transportation tasks have been affected.

    It should be pointed out that in the process of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method, some cadres have adopted an erroneous attitude of resistance. They believe that "we have had these systems here before," "they are not suitable for our specific circumstances," and so on. These comrades' thinking is conservative. They lack sensitivity to new things, have not seriously studied and understood the essence of the Li Xikui shunting method; they have not fully recognized the important role of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method for the people's railway transportation work, and therefore have not seriously promoted the Li Xikui shunting method. This is obviously wrong and must be immediately corrected and overcome.

    The Li Xikui shunting method is a scientific and complete set of shunting operations, a product of the combination of the advanced experience of Soviet railway construction and advanced work in Chinese railways. Therefore, railway transportation cadres across the country must seriously and earnestly promote the Li Xikui shunting method. It is necessary to widely publicize the specific content of the Li Xikui shunting method, organize employees to conduct in-depth study, and inspire employees' creativity so that they can apply it flexibly in light of specific circumstances. It is necessary to frequently go deep into the field, check the implementation situation, and solve problems in a timely manner. It is necessary to consciously attract technical personnel to participate in the organization and leadership so that shunting work can continuously develop and improve. Strict criticism must be given to those who refuse to promote the Li Xikui shunting method. Only in this way can the Li Xikui shunting method be widely promoted within the national railway system, fully unleash the potential of national railway transportation, and increase production and conserve more wealth for the country.

### 认真推广李锡奎先进调车法

    认真推广李锡奎先进调车法
    李锡奎调车组创造的新调车法，提高调车效率百分之六十以上，为国家积累了大批财富。这种先进工作经验，是值得重视和推广的。
    为了提高车站技术作业，发挥铁路运输的潜在能力，争取超额完成国家运输任务，中央人民政府铁道部于今年八月指示全国各铁路管理局，大力推广李锡奎调车法。铁道部的这一指示，已引起了全国运输工作人员的注意。全国各主要车站，已先后开始学习、重点试行并全站推行这一先进工作经验。各站学习和运用李锡奎调车法的结果，普遍使各站的调车工作效率得到提高；这样就加速了车辆周转时间，保证以现有车辆和设备完成更多的国家运输任务。经验证明：那一个管理局或车站重视了并认真推行了李锡奎调车法，那里的调车工作效率就提高了，运输任务就完成或超额完成了。反之，调车工作效率就没有显著的提高，运输任务也受到影响。
    应当指出，在推广李锡奎调车法过程中，有一部分干部，采取了错误的抵抗的态度。他们认为：“这些制度我们这里也都有过”，“不适合我们的具体情况”，等等。这些同志的思想是保守的。他们对新鲜事物缺乏敏感，没有认真学习和了解李锡奎调车法的精神实质；没有充分认识推广李锡奎调车法，对于人民铁道运输工作的重要的作用，因而也就没有认真推广李锡奎调车法。这显然是错误，必须立即加以纠正克服。
    李锡奎调车法是一套科学而完整的调车作业法，是苏联铁路建设的先进经验和中国铁路先进工作相结合的产物。因此，全国铁路运输干部必须严肃地认真地推广李锡奎调车法。必须广泛地宣传李锡奎调车法的具体内容，组织职工进行深入的学习，并启发职工的创造性，使能结合具体情况，加以灵活运用。必须经常深入现场，检查推行情况，及时解决问题。必须有意识地吸引技术人员，参与组织领导，使调车工作不断地发展和提高。对于那些拒绝推广李锡奎调车法的现象，必须给以严格的批评。只有这样，才能使李锡奎调车法在全国铁路范围内广泛地推广开来，充分发挥全国铁路运输的潜在能力，为国家增产节约更多的财富。
