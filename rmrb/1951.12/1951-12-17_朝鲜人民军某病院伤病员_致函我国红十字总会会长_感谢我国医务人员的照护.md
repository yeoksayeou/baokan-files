    Wounded and Sick Soldiers of a Certain Hospital of the Korean People's Army
    Send a Letter to the President of the Red Cross Society of China Thanking Chinese Medical Personnel for Their Care
    President of the Red Cross Society of China: We are wounded and sick soldiers of the Korean People's Army who, thanks to the warm care of the comrades of the First Detachment of the Chinese International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team, are about to fully recover our health. Countless outstanding sons and daughters of China have displayed the same high degree of internationalism on our land as Dr. Bethune. Today, we are seeing them off with reluctance.
    Comrade Li Weiying, the head nurse of the Seventh Squad of the First Detachment, has given us motherly love. On August 13th and 14th, hundreds of enemy planes frantically and indiscriminately bombed peaceful residents in the suburbs of Pyongyang. Comrade Li Weiying braved the enemy's bombing to rescue many seriously wounded patients. Usually, she would share the biscuits, bread, cigarettes, etc., that the superiors gave her with the wounded and sick and the farmers in the village. She repeatedly used her own living expenses to buy towels and soap for us. In daily life, she is most able to abide by mass discipline and patiently does environmental sanitation work. In addition, Comrade Li Weiying often provides us with spiritual food. She actively reported the current political situation and the situation of the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to the wounded and sick and all the farmers in the village through interpreters. She also created literary works such as "A Disabled Soldier" and "Take Care," singing or reciting them to the wounded and sick.
    The comrades who worked with Comrade Li Weiying in our ward all displayed a high degree of internationalism. Their serious work style, amiable attitude, and kind words moved every comrade. We would like to express our most sincere respect to all the Chinese people and to you!
        Representatives of the Wounded and Sick in the Tenth Ward of a Certain Hospital of the Korean People's Army, Li Caiyuan

    朝鲜人民军某病院伤病员
    致函我国红十字总会会长  感谢我国医务人员的照护
    中国红十字总会会长：我们是在中国国际医防服务队第一大队的同志们热诚救护下，将要完全恢复健康的朝鲜人民军伤病员。中国的无数优秀儿女，在我们的国土上发挥了像白求恩大夫一样的高度国际主义精神。今天，我们正以依依不舍的心情来欢送他们。
    李伟英同志，是第一大队第七小队的看护长，从她的身上，我们得到了慈母般的爱。八月十三、十四两天，敌机数百架疯狂滥炸平壤城郊和平居民，李伟英同志冒着敌机的轰炸，抢救了许多的重伤病员。平常，上级配给她的饼干、面包、香烟等，她都分给伤病员和村中农民。她好几次用自己的生活费买毛巾和肥皂送给我们。在日常生活中，她最能遵守群众纪律，并耐心地作环境卫生工作。另外，李伟英同志还经常供给我们精神食粮。她主动地通过翻译员向伤病员和全村农民，报告目前的政治形势和中国人民抗美援朝运动的情形。她还创作了“一个残废的战士”、“保重”等文艺作品，给伤病员歌唱或朗诵。
    和李伟英同志共同在我们病栋工作的同志，都发挥了高度的国际主义精神。他们认真的工作作风、和蔼的态度、亲切的语言，感动了每一个同志。我们谨以挚诚的心情向全中国人民和您致以最崇高的敬礼！
        朝鲜人民军某病院第十病栋伤病员代表　李裁远
