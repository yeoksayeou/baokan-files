    Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Electromechanical Depot
    Allows Important Machinery to Rust and Deteriorate

    To the Editor: The Electromechanical Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau stores dozens of kinds of valuable machines, including locomotives and other costly equipment, with a total value of approximately 500 million yuan. These machines were shipped from Shanghai in April of the year before last. For more than two years, the Electromechanical Depot has neither used these machines nor transferred them elsewhere, but has left them in the open air, exposed to wind and rain. Now, a layer of rust has formed on the machines, and many parts are unusable. This is a significant waste, and I suggest that the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau promptly address this matter.

### 郑州铁路局机务处电力所  任凭重要机器生锈损耗

    郑州铁路局机务处电力所
    任凭重要机器生锈损耗
    编辑同志：郑州铁路管理局机务处电力所存放着数十种贵重机器，其中有机关车等贵重机器，价值共约五亿元。这些机器是在前年四月从上海运来的。两年多来，电力所一直不使用这些机器，也不调往他处，却放在露天的地方，任凭风吹雨淋。现在，机器上已生了一层铁锈，很多零件都不能使用了。这是一种很大的浪费，我建议郑州铁路管理局迅速处理这件事。    　王庆五
