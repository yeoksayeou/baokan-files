A Striking Example of Disregard for Workers' Lives
    ——The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Failure to Address Workers' Toilet Problems for Two Years

    I. The Pressing Toilet Problem for Workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant

    The issue of building more toilets is one of the most pressing demands that has not been resolved for all workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant for the past two years. Currently, on average, over 300 people share one toilet, and over 80 people share one pit. How is this sufficient? Moreover, the distribution of toilets is very uneven. The area near the factory director's office occupies about one-sixth of the total, so the toilets in each workshop are even more "burdened." Due to the scarcity of toilets, workers have nowhere to go for defecation and urination. They have to go to the side of the railway tracks, the side of the cart road, on the ore, scrap steel, cinder, and in small pits everywhere… to defecate and urinate. This situation is particularly serious in departments with large numbers of people and very few toilets. The General Power Section has several hundred people, but only one toilet with four pits, which is also used by people from nearby departments. Therefore, the vast majority of them, from the section chief to the apprentices, defecate and urinate on the cinder and in the pits about 50 steps away from the workshop. Before and after work every day, there are often one or two dozen workers in that area. What’s more, the vast majority of our toilets are very dirty. Take the General Power Section as an example: the feces in the latrine pits are piled up and no one manages them. Workers have to put two bricks under their feet to defecate. In the past, comrades in the General Power Section came up with a method: whoever made a mistake, such as fighting, would be punished by cleaning the toilet. This method kept their toilets clean for a period, and they even whitewashed the walls this summer. However, the Movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and the democratic reforms have made workers' consciousness increase day by day, and no one fights or quarrels anymore. This method no longer works. In the steelmaking department’s toilets, on average, over 100 people use one pit. When the feces are full, the workers have to poke it with a stick. As for hygiene, there is no way to talk about it. There is also a toilet in the assembly department, located next to the road, without a door or screen wall. People and vehicles pass by all day, so no one can go during the day. This situation has a great impact on production and the health of workers. It has begun to snow, it is very cold outside, and the workshop is warm. To save time, workers sometimes run out in thin clothes to defecate and urinate in the wind and snow. The situation is even worse in the summer. On sunny days, it smells unbearable; on rainy days, people who go to the toiltes without roofs are rained on, and the toilets are filled with water. The toilets are so dirty, but except for those used by staff, the vast majority of workers’ toilets have no electric lights. The reason is that in the past, individual backward workers stole light bulbs, so the administration simply stopped installing them. What kind of attitude is this towards the workers? For one or two years, several thousand of us have been groping in and out of the toilets in the dark.

    II. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Handling of the Toilet Problem

    The serious toilet problem at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is not a recent occurrence; it is an old problem that has existed for two years. Because it has caused many difficulties for workers, they have been constantly raising concerns since last spring. At the two employee representative conferences in July and September last year, the representatives also raised this issue, demanding the rapid construction of more toilets. Some workshops have even written several written reports to the factory about this matter. But none of them had any practical effect. At first, the administrative leaders of the factory said: The toilet problem needs to be solved through a unified plan, and the construction of toilets can only begin after the factory's long-term plan is decided. Otherwise, it would be a waste to build them and then demolish them in the future. Later, because the problem was not resolved, workers still often raised concerns. Workers said, "It's really outrageous to always defecate and urinate in the corners and by the side of the road. We must build toilets no matter what. We can't stop people from defecating and urinating!" At the employee representative conference in September last year, the administrative leaders of the factory accepted everyone's opinions. He said to the representatives: Comrades' opinions are correct, the toilet problem must be resolved. Everyone was very happy to hear this, but the problem was still not resolved afterwards. It is said that it was because there was no money. This spring, there was a real hope for a solution to the toilet problem: the Iron and Steel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry approved a budget of 200 million yuan to build four large toilets. However, so far, only one toilet has been built, and it is located far from the central area of the factory, next to the newly built factory building. With money, why can't toilets still be built? Comrades in the Engineering Section said: At first, it was because they couldn't find a place to start construction; later, they asked the Planning Office to "plan" the location, but they never "planned" it out; finally, because the budget for building a building and installing heating was insufficient, the money for building toilets was diverted. Building a few toilets for the workers is not a complicated problem. This request from the workers is also a reasonable and basic request. But the workers raised concerns for two years, and the higher authorities approved 200 million yuan, but the problem has still not been resolved. Now the money is gone, and there is no sign of a solution.

    III. Why Has the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Toilet Problem Not Been Resolved for Two Years?

    Why has the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's toilet problem not been resolved for two years? Is it, as mentioned earlier, because "the factory's long-term plan has not been determined," "there is no money," or "there is no place"?

    No, it is not. First of all, it is not a matter of "the factory's long-term plan has not been determined." Using this as an excuse not to build toilets is simply a lack of common sense. Workers have to defecate and urinate every day, which absolutely cannot wait for the "long-term plan." Second, it is not a matter of "no money." As mentioned earlier, this year there is already a toilet construction fee of more than 200 million yuan, which should be considered "having money"! The toilets still haven't been built, have they? Even going back to last year, it was not a matter of "no money." Workers only ask for a "place" to defecate and urinate, which can be solved without spending a lot of money. There are a lot of broken bricks and tiles in the factory. Picking them up can build some toilets, and even if they are demolished in the future, there will be no "waste." The problem is that some cadres have not considered the toilet problem from the perspective of quickly solving the actual difficulties and demands of the workers. Third, it is not a matter of "no place." The workers said it well: "Each family in the newly built high-level staff dormitory has a flush toilet. Can't a toilet be squeezed into such a large workshop?" There is a lot of open space around some workshops. For example, outside the General Power Section, where the problem is most serious, many toilets can be built. People who make plans and draw pictures work in the room based on imagination, without considering the actual situation of the factory and the demands of the vast number of workers, and they made unrealistic large plans, which also increased the difficulty of the location problem.

    Therefore, I believe that there is no reason why the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's toilet problem has not been resolved for two years. This can only be said to be the result of the factory's relevant cadres seriously not caring about the workers' lives. Because in reality, in action, they have forgotten the simplest truth: workers also need a place to defecate and urinate. I hope this situation can be corrected quickly.

    不关心工人生活的一个显著的例子
    ——太原钢铁厂两年来没有解决工人的厕所问题
    太原钢铁厂劳动模范  王贵英
    一、太原钢铁厂存在迫切的工人厕所问题
    增建厕所问题，是我们太原钢铁厂全体工人两年来未得解决的最迫切的要求之一。现在厂里平均三百多人用一个厕所，八十多人用一个坑。这那里够用呢？而且，厕所的分布又很不平衡。厂长办公室附近就占去了约六分之一，因此，各车间的厕所，“负担”就更多了。由于厕所太少，工人大、小便就没了去处。他们只好到铁路旁边、马车路旁边、矿石上、废钢上、灰渣上，各处的小土坑里……去大、小便。这种情况，尤其在那些人多厕所特别少的部门，更加严重。总动力科有几百人，仅有一个厕所、四个坑，同时还有附近其他部门的人也来使用。因此，他们绝大部分人，从科长到学徒，都是到离工房约五十步远的灰渣上和土坑里大、小便，每天上、下班前后，在那一带常常有一、二十个工人。这还不算，我们的绝大多数厕所都是十分肮脏的。还以总动力科为例吧：茅坑里的粪便堆满了没人管，工人要在两脚下各垫两块砖才能大便。过去总动力科的同志们曾经想了这样一个办法：谁犯了错误，如打了架等，便罚他扫厕所。这个办法，曾经使他们的厕所干净了一个时期，而且在今年夏天，还把墙粉刷了一番。但是，抗美援朝运动和民主改革，使工人同志的觉悟一天天提高，谁也不打架吵嘴了。这个办法便不起作用了。炼钢部的厕所，平均一百多人用着一个坑，粪便满了，工人只好用棍子通一通，至于卫生，是根本谈不到的。还有装配部的一个厕所，设在大路旁边，没有门，也没有影壁，成天人来车往，白天不能去人。这种情况，对生产和工人的身体都有很大影响。现在已开始下雪，外边很冷，工房很暖，工人同志为了节省时间，有时穿着单薄的衣服跑出去，在风天雪地里大、小便。夏天时，情况更恶劣。在晴天，臭得没办法；在雨天，去没有顶子的厕所大便的人，被雨淋着，厕所里又都灌满了水。厕所这样脏，但是除了职员用的以外，工人的厕所绝大多数没有电灯，原因是过去曾有个别落后工人偷了灯泡，行政上就干脆不安了。这对工人算是什么态度呢？我们几千人就这样在黑夜里摸索着进出厕所一、两年了。
    二、太原钢铁厂处理厕所问题的经过
    太原钢铁厂厕所问题的严重情况，并不是最近才发生的，这是两年之久的老问题了。因为它给工人造成了许多困难，所以从去年春天开始，工人就不断地提意见。在去年七月、九月的两次职工代表会上，代表们也都曾提出这个问题，要求迅速增建厕所。有的车间还曾为此事向厂里写过数次书面报告。但都没有发生实际效果。开始，厂的行政负责同志说：厕所问题，需统一计划解决，要等整个厂的长远计划决定后，才能着手修建厕所，否则修好后将来又拆，是一种浪费。后来，因为问题没解决，工人还是常常提意见，工人说：“老是这样在墙角道边大、小便，实在不像话，无论如何要修厕所，不能不叫大、小便呀！”去年九月职工代表会上，厂的行政负责同志接受了大家的意见，他向代表们说：同志们的意见是对的，厕所问题一定要解决。大家听了，都很高兴，但事后仍未解决。据说是因为没有钱。今年春天，厕所问题曾经有了真正的解决希望：中央重工业部钢铁局批准了修四个大厕所的预算——两亿元。但是，到现在仅仅修了一个厕所，而且在离厂的中心区很远的新建的厂房旁边。有了钱，为什么还不能建厕所？工程科的同志说：开始，是因为找不到地方，不能动工；后来让计划室“计划”地点，但始终也没有“计划”出来；最后，因为修建一座楼房和安装暖气等的预算不够，就把修厕所的钱挪用了。给工人修几个厕所，这不是什么复杂的问题。工人的这种要求，也是合理的最起码的要求。但是工人提了两年意见，上级批给了两亿元人民币，却始终没有解决。现在钱也没有了，更看不出什么头绪来了。
    三、太原钢铁厂厕所问题为什么两年未得解决？
    太原钢铁厂的厕所问题，为什么两年未得解决？是不是如前边所讲的，是因为“全厂长远计划未定”、“没有钱”、“没有地方”呢？
    不是的。首先，不是什么“全厂长远计划未定”的问题。用这一点作藉口而不修厕所，简直是缺乏常识。工人大、小便，是天天必有的事，是绝对不能等待“长远计划”的。第二，也不是“没有钱”的问题。如前所述，今年已经有了两亿元之多的厕所修建费，应该算“有钱”了吧！厕所不是照样没有修起来吗？就是退到去年说，也不是“没有钱”的问题。工人只是要求有个大、小便的“去处”，这是不用花很多钱就可以解决的。厂里有很多碎砖烂瓦，拾一拾就可以垒起些厕所，将来假使拆掉的话，也没啥“浪费”。问题是有些干部，没有从迅速解决工人的实际困难和要求出发来考虑厕所问题。第三，也不是“没有地方”的问题。工人说得好：“新修的高级职员宿舍里，每一家有一个抽水马桶，这样大的工房里反而按不下个厕所吗？”有些工房四周空地是很多的。如问题最严重的总动力科的外边，多少厕所都修得下。作计划和画图的人，坐在屋子里凭想像办事，不考虑厂子的实际情况和广大工人的要求，定了不合实际的大计划，也给地点问题增加了困难。
    因此，我认为太原钢铁厂的厕所问题两年未得解决，是没有任何道理的。这只能说是厂的有关干部严重地不关心工人生活的结果。因为他们在实际上、在行动上，忘记了一条最简单的真理：工人也需要有大、小便的地方。我希望这种情况能够很快地改正过来。
