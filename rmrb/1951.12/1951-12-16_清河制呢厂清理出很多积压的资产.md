    Qinghe Woolen Mill Clears Out Many Accumulated Assets
    Editor: In July of this year, our Qinghe Woolen Mill conducted an asset inventory and capital verification. We cleared out a lot of accumulated materials. For example, the preparation workshop had accumulated more than 6 million yuan worth of 40-count cotton rope over the past three years, but the dyeing workshop bought another batch of cotton rope this spring; the combing and spinning workshop had enough combing machine brackets to last ten years; the materials section warehouse had more than three tons of paint in stock, worth nearly 1 billion yuan. Most of these phenomena are due to unsound systems and the lack of planning in material usage. This inventory pointed out a path for our workers to manage the factory. I believe that doing a good job in asset inventory can not only make many accumulated materials be used to their full potential, but is also a prerequisite for implementing the economic accounting system.

    清河制呢厂清理出很多积压的资产
    编辑同志：今年七月，我们清河制呢厂进行了清理资产核定资金的工作。我们清理出很多的积压材料。例如，准备车间三年来已经积压了价值六百多万元的四十号棉绳，但整染车间在今年春季又买进了一批棉绳；梳纺车间储备了足够十年用的梳毛机支架；材料股仓库里积压了三吨多颜料，价值将近十亿元。这些现象，大部是由于制度不健全，以及用料没有计划造成的。这次清点，给我们工人指出了一条管理工厂的道路。我认为：作好清理资产工作，不但能使许多积压的材料，作到物尽其用，而且是实施经济核算制的先决条件。　周宏才
