China Native Produce Company's Branches in Various Regions Improve Business Management, Saving 80 Billion Yuan in Ten Months

The various branches of the China Native Produce Company have improved their business management and saved approximately 81 billion yuan in various expenses over the past ten months.

The local native produce companies have carried out the following tasks in improving business management:

	I. Accelerating capital turnover: The Southwest District Company adopted a method of circulating and calling funds, using surpluses to make up for shortages, thereby reducing capital backlog. The average capital inventory of the district decreased by 16% in July compared to June, and by 41% in August compared to June. The Northeast District Company implemented a three-level settlement system, promoting operational enthusiasm, and the capital turnover in the second quarter was 0.06 times faster than in the first quarter. The Henan Province Company implemented an inventory quota system, and the average inventory in the province in August decreased by 50% compared to July. The Hunan Province Company adopted a policy of small profits and quick turnover to accelerate commodity circulation.

	II. Reducing commodity circulation costs: In the East China District Company, circulation costs accounted for 13.94% of the circulation volume in June, but fell to 7.84% in July, and further to 5.91% in August. The Shandong Province Company purchased a batch of timber from the Coal Industry Building Materials Company and transported it to Qingxian and Tai'an, using sidetrack loading, saving more than 4 million yuan in transportation costs. The Southern Anhui Branch Company changed the transport of hemp skin to Shanghai from joint transportation by wooden sailboats to self-employed shipping, saving more than 1.4 million yuan in transportation costs. The Northwest District Company transported 300 tons of goods from Qinghai and Xikang to Xi'an, switching from trucks to horse-drawn carts, also saving more than 37 million yuan in transportation costs. In the past, the Hunan Province Company mostly entrusted transportation firms to handle railway freight, incurring huge handling fees and escort fees; now it has switched to self-handling, saving more than 75 million yuan in expenses in three months. When transporting four batches of green hemp and scrap copper, the provincial companies in the Southwest region, due to solid packaging, could ship them directly without warehousing, saving 23 million yuan in handling, weighing, lifting, and barging costs. Last year, the Heilongjiang Province Company in Northeast China transported an average of 9 tons of flax per vehicle; this year, it has generally increased to 11 tons, also saving a large amount of transportation costs.

	III. Emphasizing the improvement of packaging specifications: The Pingyuan Province Company changed the packaging of red dates to cloth bags and reduced the volume of vermicelli packaging, reducing transportation costs. The Southwest District Native Produce Company processed and repackaged green hemp, Chinese gall, cordyceps, and other products at the place of origin, creating brands and directly exporting and selling them, without the need for repackaging at the port. The packaging of Chinese gall was changed from bamboo mats to bamboo baskets, saving 2% in packaging costs. Some also changed round packages to square packages, reducing the volume of materials of the same weight by one-third.

In addition, companies in various regions launched patriotic labor competitions among all employees to improve work efficiency, also saving a considerable amount of expenses.

    改善经营管理十个月节省八百亿元
    中国土产公司所属各地分支公司，改善了经营管理，十个月来，共节省各种费用约八百一十亿元。
    各地土产公司在改善经营管理上，进行了以下工作：
    一、加速资金周转：西南区公司采用了资金巡回调用办法，以有余补不足，减少了资金积压。该区资金平均库存量七月份较六月份减少百分之十六，八月份较六月份减少百分之四十一。东北区公司推行三级结算制，促进了经营积极性，第二季度资金周转较第一季度快○·○六次。河南省公司执行了库存限额制，八月份全省平均库存较七月份减少百分之五十。湖南省公司采用薄利广销的方针，加速了商品流转。
    二、减低商品流转费用：华东区公司六月份流转费占流转额的百分之十三点九四，七月份流转费降到占流转额的百分之七点八四，八月份流转费又降到占流转额的百分之五点九一。山东省公司购入煤业建筑器材公司木料一批，运往青县、泰安，改用岔道装车，节省运费四百多万元。皖南分公司往上海运麻皮由木帆船联运改为自雇船运，节省运费一百四十多万元。西北区公司从青海、西康向西安运货三百吨，由汽车改用马车，也节省运费三千七百多万元。湖南省公司过去在铁路货运方面，多委托运输商行代办，花费手续费和押运费巨大；现改为自办托押，三个月内节省费用七千五百余万元。西南区各省公司在运输四批青麻和废铜时，由于包装结实，可以直接运出，不用进仓，节省搬运、过秤、提装、驳船等费用二千三百万元。东北黑龙江省公司去年运线麻每车平均装九吨，今年普遍提高为十一吨，也节省了大量运费。
    三、重视改善包装规格：平原省公司把红枣改用布包，把粉丝的包装压小体积，减低了运输成本。西南区土产公司把青麻、五棓子、虫草等在产地加工改装，创出牌号，直接出口外销，无须在口岸改装。五棓子由篾包改用竹篮，节省包装费用百分之二。还有的把圆包改为方包，使同一重量的物资体积缩小三分之一。
    此外，各地公司发动全体职工开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，提高工作效率，也节省了不少费用。
