Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: According to a TASS report from Paris: The Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the proposal forced upon the UN General Assembly by the United States, Britain, and France to establish a UN committee to investigate whether free all-German elections could be held in Germany.

Since the Special Political Committee passed a resolution on the 4th, inviting representatives from West Germany and the German Democratic Republic to express their opinions, the representatives of the West German puppet government spoke on the 8th, trying their best to slander the German Democratic Republic, distort the situation in Germany, and defend the plans of the US, British, and French imperialists to divide Germany.

The delegation of the German Democratic Republic, composed of Deputy Prime Minister Bolz, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, Mayor of Greater Berlin Ebert, and State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ackermann, attended the meeting on the 11th. Bolz and Ebert spoke at the meeting, explaining the views of the German Democratic Republic.

Bolz first explained that the delegation of the German Democratic Republic was speaking at this meeting on behalf of the new, peace-loving, and democratic Germany that had risen from the ruins of the Hitler regime. He said that the German Democratic Republic was laying the foundation for a new, peace-loving Germany in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. Its propositions and policies conform to the wishes of the vast majority of the German people in both the East and the West. Bolz emphasized that the German people longed to restore the unity of Germany, conclude a peace treaty, and withdraw the occupying forces. The Soviet Union, which suffered the most from German aggression, supports these legitimate demands of the German people, but the countries that play a leading role in the North Atlantic bloc do not. Bolz pointed out that since its establishment, the government of the German Democratic Republic has consistently regarded the unification of Germany and the guarantee of peace as its basic tasks. Its government and People's Chamber have repeatedly proposed convening all-German conferences to discuss holding all-German elections and accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. These proposals have been supported by the peace-loving people in East and West Germany, but have been rejected by the Western occupying powers and the West German puppet government. Their position is determined by the overall political line of the Western occupying powers towards Germany. The United States, Britain, and France are strengthening their armed forces in West Germany and are implementing a policy of remilitarizing West Germany. As a result of this policy, the economic burden on the people of West Germany is becoming heavier and heavier.

Bolz said that the suggestion of establishing a UN committee to investigate the conditions for free elections in Germany is to prevent the holding of all-German elections and to prevent the unification and peaceful development of Germany. However, the German people, who long for the unification of their motherland, have no doubt about the necessity and possibility of holding free all-German elections.

Bolz finally stated on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic: Holding free elections for the all-German People's Assembly is an internal affair of the German people themselves. Establishing a UN investigation committee is an interference in the internal affairs of the German people. This not only violates the interests and wishes of the German people, but also contradicts the principles of the United Nations. The peace-loving German people will never allow anyone to interfere in the holding of all-German elections, and they firmly oppose the establishment of a UN investigation committee.

In his speech, Ebert also denounced the policies of the Western three powers in dividing Germany and harming the fundamental interests of the German people. He pointed out that the people of West Berlin live a life of hardship and oppression, while the people in the democratic districts of Berlin freely engage in peaceful and constructive labor. He said: The residents of the German capital and the vast majority of the German people believe that all-German elections are not only possible, but also necessary and should be held as soon as possible. There is no need for a UN committee to conduct any investigation; what is needed is the unity of the Germans in order to hold all-German elections that guarantee unity and peace in accordance with the will of the German people.

After hearing the opinions of the representatives of West Germany and the German Democratic Republic, the Special Political Committee continued its general debate on the 12th. The Czechoslovak representative said in the general debate: By following the path pointed out by the representative of the German Democratic Republic, the German people can guarantee peace and security for the whole of Europe. He expressed his opposition to the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France, and pointed out that the proposals of the three countries are to force the United Nations organization to illegally prevent the German people from deciding their own destiny against the Charter of the United Nations, with the aim of deepening the division of Germany in order to use the German people to realize the United States' plan to invade Europe.

At the meeting on the 14th, five Latin American countries, including Brazil, put forward a "new" proposal in order to cover up the attempts of the United States, Britain, and France to obstruct German unification. The Swedish representative also put forward another proposal at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 15th: The delegation of the German Democratic Republic, which was invited to Paris by the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to express its views to the Special Political Committee on the organization of the so-called international committee to investigate whether all-German elections could be held, left Paris on the 14th to return to its country. Among those who went to the airport to see them off were: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly, Pavlov, a member of the delegation, Podecherov, the secretary-general; members of the Ukrainian, Belarusian, Polish, and Czechoslovak delegations to the UN General Assembly; and the diplomatic representatives of Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to France.

    德意志民主共和国代表团在联大特别政委会上
    痛斥美英法三国分裂德国的罪恶政策
    主张举行全德选举，反对建立联合国调查委员会
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会继续讨论美英法三国强迫联合国大会接受讨论的所谓组织联合国委员会以调查德国能否举行全德自由选举的提案。
    自从特别政治委员会在四日通过邀请西德及德意志民主共和国的代表表示意见的决议以后，西德傀儡政府代表于八日在会上发言，竭力诽谤德意志民主共和国，歪曲德国情况，为美英法帝国主义分裂德国的计划辩护。
    由德意志民主共和国副总理博尔茨、副总理努舍克、大柏林市长艾伯特、外交部国务秘书阿克曼组成的德意志民主共和国代表团，于十一日出席会议。博尔茨和艾伯特在会上发言，说明德意志民主共和国的观点。
    博尔茨首先说明，德意志民主共和国代表团在这次会议上讲话，是代表从希特勒政权的废墟上兴起的、新的、爱好和平的、民主的德国。他说，德意志民主共和国正在按照波茨坦协定的原则给新的爱好和平的德国奠定基础。它的主张和政策符合于东西两部绝大多数德国人民的愿望。博尔茨强调，德国人民渴望恢复德国的统一、缔结和约与撤退占领军。曾经遭受德国侵略之害最重的苏联支持德国人民的这些合法要求，但是，在北大西洋集团中起领导作用的国家却不是这样。博尔茨指出，德意志民主共和国政府自成立以来，就一贯认为统一德国和保证和平是它的基本任务。它的政府和人民议会曾屡次提出召开全德会议讨论举行全德选举和加速缔结对德和约的建议。这些建议获得东西德爱好和平的人民的支持，但是却为西方占领国家和西德傀儡政府所拒绝。它们的这种立场是西方占领国家对德国的总的政治路线所决定的。美英法三国正在加强它们在西德的武装力量，正在实行使西德重新军国主义化的政策。由于实行这个政策的结果，西德人民的经济负担越来越沉重。
    博尔茨说，成立联合国委员会以在德国调查有无举行自由选举的条件的建议，是为了阻止举行全德选举，阻止德国的统一与和平发展。但是，渴望祖国统一的德国人民一点也不怀疑举行全德自由选举的必要和可能。
    博尔茨最后代表德意志民主共和国政府声明：举行全德国民议会自由选举，是德国人民自己的内部事务。建立联合国调查委员会是对德国人民内部事务的干涉。这不仅违反德国人民的利益和愿望，而且也和联合国的原则相矛盾。爱好和平的德国人民决不容许有人干涉全德选举的举行，他们坚决反对建立联合国调查委员会。
    艾伯特在发言中也痛斥西方三国分裂德国、损害德国人民根本利益的政策。他指出西柏林人民过着困苦和受压迫的生活，而柏林民主区的人民却自由地从事和平的建设性劳动。他说：德国首都的居民和绝大多数德国人民都认为，全德选举不仅是可能的，而且是必要的，应该尽速举行。用不着联合国委员会来进行任何调查，所需要的只是德国人的团结，以便依照德国人民的意志举行保证统一与和平的全德选举。
    在听取了西德代表和德意志民主共和国代表的意见以后，特别政治委员会于十二日继续进行一般辩论。捷克斯洛伐克代表在一般辩论中发言说：照着德意志民主共和国代表所指出的大道前进，德国人民就可以保证全欧洲的和平与安全。他表示反对美英法三国提案，并指出三国提案是强使联合国组织违背联合国宪章非法地阻止德国人民自行决定自己的命运，其目的在加深德国的分裂，以利用德国人民来实现美国侵略欧洲的计划。
    在十四日会议上，巴西等五个拉丁美洲国家为了掩饰美、英、法三国阻挠德国统一的企图，提出了一个“新”提案。瑞典代表也在会上提出了另一个提案。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：应联合国大会特别政治委员会的邀请赴巴黎就组织所谓国际委员会以调查能否举行全德选举一事向特别政治委员会发表意见的德意志民主共和国代表团，已于十四日离巴黎返国。到机场欢送的有：苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基，团员巴甫洛夫，秘书长波得切罗夫；乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克等国出席联合国大会代表团团员；阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克驻法国的外交代表。
