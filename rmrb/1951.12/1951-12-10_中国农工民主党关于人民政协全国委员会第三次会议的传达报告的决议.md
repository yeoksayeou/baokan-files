    The Sixth National Cadre Conference of our party fully agrees with the report on the transmission of the various reports and resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made at the conference.

    The conference believes that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, New China has achieved unprecedented great achievements and victories in politics, economy, national defense, culture, and education over the past two years. These achievements and victories demonstrate the superiority of the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship and prove that the strength of the Chinese people cannot be defeated by any enemy.

    The conference fully accepts and unanimously supports the various reports and resolutions of the National Committee, and designates the three central tasks pointed out by Chairman Mao at the conference: continuing to strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, promoting and promoting the patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift, and widely launching the ideological remolding movement, as the three central tasks of the party. We call on party organizations at all levels to immediately launch a report on the transmission within the party, organize comrades to discuss and study documents, and earnestly promote this movement among the masses, and strive to complete the three central tasks.
