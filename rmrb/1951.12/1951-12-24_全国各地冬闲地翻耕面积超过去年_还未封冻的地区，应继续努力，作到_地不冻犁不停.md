The area of winter fallow land tilled this year across the country has exceeded that of last year, and the tillage is deeper and more meticulous than last year. This is an important step in striving for a bumper harvest next year.

In North China, the area of autumn tillage has exceeded that of last year. As of the end of November, the autumn tillage in Chahar Province had completed more than 90% of the cultivatable land, exceeding last year by 8%; Hebei Province had completed 91%; Shanxi Province had completed 75%; and most areas of Suiyuan Province had completed the autumn tillage task. In East China, winter tillage has become widespread in vast rural areas, with a surge in some areas, and winter tillage in Shandong Province is nearing completion. In Central South, Northwest, and Southwest China, winter tillage work is being intensified. In Northeast China, Liaoxi and Rehe provinces have reversed the conservative thinking of farmers who believe autumn tillage is not beneficial and are seizing the opportunity to actively till the land.

The characteristics of this year's autumn tillage movement are: (1) In many areas, leading organs have formulated autumn tillage plans and dispatched cadres to supervise and inspect, which has powerfully promoted autumn tillage. For example, leading organs at all levels in Shanxi Province dispatched more than 1,000 cadres to go deep into rural areas to inspect, reversing the thinking of separating autumn harvest and autumn tillage and emphasizing sideline occupations over autumn tillage, so that the autumn tillage movement quickly unfolded. (2) Strengthen patriotic education, implement preferential treatment policies, and solve the difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, families of revolutionary workers, and households without labor or livestock who cannot carry out autumn tillage. This year, the slogan "Soldiers' families first, then ourselves" was universally put forward in autumn tillage, solving the difficulties of martyrs' and soldiers' families lacking labor to carry out autumn tillage, thus expanding the area of autumn tillage. For example, according to statistics from five counties in Hebei Province, including Hejian and Jiaohe, there are more than 1,800 households of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, with more than 19,000 mu of uncultivated land, all of which have been cultivated once, and 20% of the land has been cultivated twice. Moreover, many farmers voluntarily provide voluntary labor to help martyrs' and soldiers' families with autumn tillage. (3) Autumn tillage is closely combined with pest control. This year, various places have attached importance to mobilizing the masses to dig up eggs and pick up pupae during autumn tillage. For example, the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province has organized and planned to hire 23,700 head of livestock to help with autumn tillage in areas affected by locust plagues in Wen'an, Ninghe, Wuqing, and other counties. Huanghua County formed a locust egg digging headquarters, and the deputy county head personally led many cadres to lead and mobilize more than 6,000 farmers to dig locust eggs in locust areas; among them, more than 4,700 people dug more than 400 jin of locust eggs in two days. This has played a considerable role in preventing insect plagues next year.

According to the current winter tillage situation in various places, the following issues should also be paid attention to:

First, in some areas, leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of carrying out the winter tillage movement, and have not grasped leadership tightly, limiting themselves to general appeals and lacking specific organization and in-depth inspection. As a result, winter tillage has not been carried out very well. Leading organs in various places should realize that doing a good job in winter tillage is an important link in increasing yield per unit area and ensuring a bumper harvest next year, seize the time, overcome various difficulties, and resolutely strive to complete the task of universal tillage once. Areas that have not completed their winter tillage plans should strive to complete them all, and must adhere to the spirit of "Plow without stopping while the ground is not frozen," "If it freezes early and is difficult to plow, plow at noon," and "Cadres do not leave the township until winter fields are completely tilled," and resolutely complete the requirements of universal tillage and deep tillage.

Second, in some areas, insect pests were serious this year; however, the mobilization of farmers to pull cotton stalks, dig eggs, and pick up pupae for pest control has not yet become a widespread movement. Therefore, the leading organs in these areas must grasp the central link of winter tillage, use concrete accounting methods to publicize the benefits of winter tillage, and make the movement quickly and comprehensively unfold.

National Wheat Planting Area Expanded
This year's national wheat planting area has exceeded that of last year. At present, wheat planting has ended across the country. According to preliminary statistics, the winter wheat planting area has expanded by about 6% compared with last year.

This year, the main wheat-producing areas in the country, such as Hebei Province and Pingyuan Province in North China, Shandong Province, Subei District, and Wanbei District in East China, Henan Province in Central South China, and Shaanxi Province in Northwest China, have all completed their wheat planting plans. In Shandong's Dezhou Special District and Huimin Special District, some cultivated land was flooded and could not be planted with wheat, but the province's wheat planting area still expanded by 9% compared with last year. Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan in the Southwest also planted a lot of wheat this year. Jiangxi's winter planting area expanded by about 100% compared with last year. Chahar, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, and other provinces mostly planted spring wheat in the past. Some places successfully tried planting winter wheat last year, and this year they have also expanded the planting area of winter wheat. In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, farmers in various places have generally paid attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation, increased fertilizer application, selected fine varieties, and implemented seed disinfection this year. For example, in Shanxi Province this year, more than 60% of the wheat fields have been plowed three times; in Laiyang Special District, Shandong Province, the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields this year has exceeded one-quarter more than before the war.

### 全国各地冬闲地翻耕面积超过去年  还未封冻的地区，应继续努力，作到“地不冻犁不停”

    全国各地冬闲地翻耕面积超过去年
    还未封冻的地区，应继续努力，作到“地不冻犁不停”
    今年全国各地冬季休闲地的翻耕面积已超过去年，而且比去年耕得深，耕得细致；这是争取明年丰收的重要环节之一。
    华北各地秋耕的面积已超过了去年，到十一月底为止，察哈尔省秋耕已完成应耕地的百分之九十以上，超过去年百分之八；河北省已完成百分之九十一；山西省完成百分之七十五；绥远省大部地区已完成秋耕任务。华东区各地广大农村已普遍冬耕，部分地区形成热潮，山东省冬耕接近完成。中南区、西北区和西南区冬耕工作正在加紧进行。东北区辽西、热河两省扭转了农民认为秋耕无益的保守思想，也正抓紧时机积极翻耕。
    今年秋耕运动的特点是：（一）很多地区的领导机关都拟定了秋耕计划，并抽派干部督促检查，有力地推动了秋耕。如山西省各级领导机关抽派一千多个干部深入农村检查，扭转了秋收和秋耕脱节以及重副业轻秋耕的思想，使秋耕运动很快地开展了起来。（二）加强爱国主义教育，贯彻优抚政策，解决革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属和无劳力畜力户不能秋耕的困难。今年秋耕中各地普遍提出“先军属后自己”的口号，解决了烈、军属缺劳力不能秋耕的困难，因而扩大了秋耕面积。如河北省河间、交河等五个县统计，共有烈属军属工属一千八百多户，白地一万九千多亩，已全部耕过一遍，并有百分之二十的地耕了两遍。且有不少农民自动出义务工帮助烈属军属秋耕。（三）秋耕和除虫密切结合。今年秋耕中各地重视发动群众挖卵、拾蛹。如河北省天津专区有组织有计划地征雇两万三千七百头牲口，到文安、宁河、武清等县蝗灾地区帮助秋耕。黄骅县组成了挖卵指挥部，副县长亲自带领许多干部领导发动六千多个农民到蝗区挖蝗卵；其中有四千七百多人，两天就挖蝗卵四百多斤。这对预防明年虫灾起了相当大的作用。
    根据目前各地冬耕情况，还应该注意解决以下几个问题：
    一、有些地区，领导干部对开展冬耕运动的重要性认识不够，没有抓紧领导，多限于一般号召，缺乏具体组织和深入检查，因之冬耕还没有很好地进行。各地领导机关应当认识到作好冬耕是提高单位面积产量保证明年丰收的重要环节，抓紧时间，克服各种困难，坚决为完成普耕一遍的任务而努力。没有完成冬耕计划的地区，应争取全部完成，必须坚持“地不冻，犁不停”，“早冻难犁晌午犁”，和“冬田不耕完，干部不离乡”的精神，坚决完成普耕、深耕的要求。
    二、有些地区，今年虫害严重；但目前发动农民拔棉柴、挖卵、拾蛹等防虫工作，还没有普遍形成运动。因此，这些地区的领导机关必须抓住冬耕这个中心环节，用具体算账的方法宣传冬耕的好处，使运动迅速地全面地开展起来。
                （中央人民政府农业部办公厅）全国种麦面积扩大
    今年全国的种麦面积已超过了去年。目前全国各地种麦已经结束。据初步统计，冬麦播种面积比去年扩大了百分之六左右。
    今年，全国的主要产麦区，如华北的河北省和平原省，华东的山东省、苏北区和皖北区，中南的河南省，西北的陕西省等省区，都已完成了种麦计划。山东的德州专区和惠民专区有些耕地积水没有退，不能种麦，但全省种麦面积还是比去年扩大了百分之九。湖南、江西和西南的四川地区今年种麦也不少，江西的冬种面积比去年扩大了约一倍。察哈尔、绥远、新疆等省过去大都种春小麦，去年有些地方试种冬麦成功，今年也扩大了播种冬麦的面积。各地农民为争取明年小麦丰收，今年种麦大都注意深耕细作和增施肥料，选用良种和实行种子消毒的也很普遍。例如：山西省今年种麦，百分之六十以上的麦田是耕过三次的；山东省莱阳专区的麦田，今年的施肥量超过战前四分之一以上。
