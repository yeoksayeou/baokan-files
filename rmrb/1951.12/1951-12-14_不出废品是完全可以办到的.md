    It is completely possible to produce no rejects
    The experience of the Northeast No. 3 Cement Plant in fighting against rejects shows that as long as conservative ideas are broken, it is completely possible to produce no rejects.
    After liberation, the output and quality of this cement plant exceeded the level during the Japanese occupation, and the production capacity of the large kilns reached 90% of the designed capacity. As a result, some cadres and workers became complacent. They said: During the Japanese occupation, the actual production capacity was only 80% of the designed capacity, which is much better now. At that time, the kilns were constantly "flowing yellow noodles" (cement was not fully fired, flowing out, and becoming waste), and now it only "flows" for two or three hours a day, isn't this much better? They believed that "a mixture of good and bad makes a good thing." They believed that the kiln was not good, and the production of rejects was inevitable. They believed that to produce no rejects, production had to be reduced and costs increased. Therefore, when they saw rejects, they acted as if nothing had happened. Although the leading cadres also tried their best to improve production and put in a lot of effort to improve the capacity of the large kilns, they did not pay attention to the issue of rejects. As a result, workers and technicians did not pay attention to quality. Later, the leading cadres made a decision and proposed "prohibiting the production of rejects." With the help of Soviet experts, they clearly realized that as long as everyone pays attention to improving quality, rejects can be avoided even with the existing equipment. After they realized this and acted accordingly, it immediately took effect, and the reject rate dropped from 20% to 4% in one month. Later, they carefully studied the characteristics of the kiln, mastered its laws, broke the conservative ideas in operating methods, accelerated the speed of kiln rotation, increased the number of revolutions of the exhaust fan, and made full use of the existing equipment. They also absorbed the correct opinions of the workers and formulated scientific operating procedures. In this way, output and quality were further improved. Soon after, they achieved the goal of producing no rejects at all, and the output exceeded the designed capacity and could be further increased.
    This process shows that to increase production and practice economy, we must first break conservative ideas and complacency. Leading cadres must not compromise on the phenomenon of rejects in the slightest and must treat it as an enemy of production, mobilize the masses, and find every means to eliminate it. The idea that "a mixture of good and bad makes a good thing" is a typical idea of compromise and reconciliation, which is extremely harmful.

    不出废品是完全可以办到的
    东北第三水泥厂和废品作斗争的经验，说明了只要打破保守思想，不出废品是完全可以办到的。
    这个水泥厂在解放后，产量质量都超过了日寇统治时的水平，大窑的生产能力达到了设计能力的百分之九十。于是部分干部和工人产生了自满情绪。他们说：日寇统治时期，实际生产能力不过达到设计能力的百分之八十，现在好多了。那时成天“淌黄面”（水泥烧不熟，淌出来，成为废品），现在一天淌两、三个钟头，这还不是好多了么？他们认为“好坏一掺合，就是好家伙”。他们认为窑不好，出废品是不可避免的。他们认为要不出废品，就得减少产量，增加成本。所以他们看到出了废品，就像没那回事似的。领导干部虽然也尽力改进生产，下了不少工夫，提高大窑能力，但却不重视出废品这件事。这样，工人和技术人员也就不重视质量了。后来，领导干部下了决心，提出“禁止生产废品”。他们在苏联专家的帮助下，明确认识了：只要大家重视提高质量，用现有的设备，也可以不出废品。他们这样认识了也这样做了之后，果然立刻见效，废品率一个月里就由百分之二十降到百分之四。后来他们又细心研究窑的特性，掌握了它的规律，打破了操作方法上的保守思想，加快转窑的速度，增加排风机的转数，把原有的设备尽量利用起来；并且吸收工人的正确意见，制定了科学的操作规程。这样，产量、质量就更加提高了。不久之后，就做到了完全不出废品，产量突破了设计能力，而且还可以再提高。
    这个过程说明：要增产节约，首先要打破保守思想和自满情绪。领导干部对于出废品的现象不能有丝毫妥协，必须把它当作生产上的仇敌，发动群众、想尽办法消灭它。“好坏一掺合，就是好家伙”的思想，是一种典型的调和、妥协思想，它是极端有害的。
