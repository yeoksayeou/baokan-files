    Opposing the Profiteering Mentality of Certain Industrialists and Businessmen

    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, private industrialists and businessmen have successively established and implemented patriotic covenants. They have shown many positive developments in paying national taxes, donating weapons, improving operations, and increasing production. This is welcome. However, since the market tended towards a new prosperity in the first half of this year, with the emergence of a situation where "the off-season is not weak, and the peak season is even stronger," a profiteering mentality has emerged among private industrialists and businessmen. This mentality has led some industrialists and businessmen to take unpatriotic actions. According to my current understanding, such phenomena have occurred in cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou.

    The manifestation of this profiteering mentality is, first of all, that some industrialists and businessmen are unwilling to accept the leadership of the state-owned economy and refuse to accept state processing orders. For example, the owner of a machine factory in Shanghai openly stated at a meeting convened by a government agency: "Processing orders are to assist industries and businesses in overcoming difficulties. Now that the difficulties are gone, there is no need for processing." The flour industry in Qingdao collectively refused to accept state processing in order to demand high profits; some factories, although accepting processing, prioritized their own production over government processing, resulting in failure to deliver on time. More seriously, a certain leather shoe cooperative in Tianjin, when undertaking military orders, actually used horse leather to pass off as cow leather; a certain paper merchant in Wuhan secretly replaced 280 reams of processed paper belonging to the state-owned trading department, stealing and selling them for profit.

    Secondly, they violate the government's policy of stabilizing prices, raising prices, snapping up materials, hoarding, and creating black markets. For example, a certain pipe manufacturing plant in Tianjin purchased a batch of 3.5-inch black iron pipes from merchants at a price of 27 million yuan per ton, and immediately resold it to a certain department that urgently needed this item, demanding 39 million yuan per ton. The paper industry in Qingdao raised factory prices by 10% to 23% in order to seek a 35% profit. Some factories in the aluminum foil industry in Shanghai snapped up aluminum foil in large quantities, causing the black market price of aluminum foil to soar.

    These thoughts and behaviors undoubtedly violate the Common Program and national financial and economic policies, and harm the interests of the entire people and the private industrialists and businessmen themselves. While continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, in order to completely defeat the aggression of American imperialism, such unpatriotic thoughts and behaviors are intolerable to our entire people and patriotic industrialists and businessmen. It is hoped that the relevant leading organs will pay attention to this, and that patriotic industrialists and businessmen will supervise each other and conscientiously report such behaviors.

                                                                                                Fang Xing

### 反对某些工商业者的暴利思想

    反对某些工商业者的暴利思想
    抗美援朝运动开展以来，私营工商界纷纷订立和执行了爱国公约。在缴纳国税、捐献武器以及改善经营、增加生产等方面，有了许多良好的表现。这是值得欢迎的。但是，自从今年上半年市场趋向新的繁荣，随着“淡季不淡，旺季更旺”情况的出现，在私营工商界中，就产生了一种暴利思想。这种思想使某些工商业者采取了非爱国主义的行动。根据我现在了解，在上海、天津、武汉、广州等城市，都发生了这样的现象。
    这种暴利思想的表现，首先是某些工商业者不愿意接受国营经济的领导，拒绝国家的加工订货。如上海某机器厂主在一个政府机关召开的会议上，曾公开表示：“加工订货是为了协助工商业克服困难，现在困难没有了，用不着加工了。”青岛的面粉业为了要求厚利，集体不接受国家的加工；有的工厂虽然接受加工，但先替自己生产，后替政府加工，以致不能按期交货。更严重的如天津某皮鞋联营社，承做军用订货，竟用马皮冒充牛皮；武汉某纸商竟偷换国营贸易部门的加工纸张二百八十令，盗卖图利。
    其次是违反政府稳定物价的政策，高抬物价、抢购物资、囤积居奇及制造黑市等等。如天津某制管厂在行商手中购进三吋半黑铁管一批，原价每吨二千七百万元，立即转卖与急需此项货物的某部门，索价每吨三千九百万元。青岛造纸业将厂盘价格抬高百分之十至二十三，以谋取百分之三十五的暴利。上海铝纸业的某些厂大批抢购铝纸，使铝纸黑市价格猛涨。
    这些思想和行为，毫无疑义，违反了共同纲领和国家财政经济政策，损害了全体人民和私营工商界自己的利益。在继续加强抗美援朝运动的时候，为了彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略，对于这种非爱国主义的思想和行为，是我们全体人民和爱国的工商业家们所不能容忍的。希望有关领导机关予以注意，并希望爱国的工商业家们互相监督和认真检举。
