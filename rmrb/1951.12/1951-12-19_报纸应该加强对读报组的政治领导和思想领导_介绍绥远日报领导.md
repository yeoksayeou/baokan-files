    Newspapers Should Strengthen Political and Ideological Leadership Over Reading Groups
    -- Introducing the Experience of the Leadership of Suiyuan Daily Reading Groups

    How newspapers can provide political and ideological leadership to the vast number of reading groups is an important issue that must be addressed. Currently, in addition to our newspaper, the following newspapers have dedicated columns on their pages to guide reading group activities: Shanghai Liberation Daily, Suiyuan Daily, Qinghai Daily, Hebei Daily, Shanxi Daily, Chahar Daily, Nanjing Xinhua Daily, New Hunan Daily, Qingdao Daily, Yunnan Daily, Wanbei Daily, Xichuan Daily, and South Sichuan Daily. Some newspapers, such as Shanghai Liberation Daily and Suiyuan Daily, have provided timely and planned leadership to reading groups. The experience of Suiyuan Daily is worth promoting.

    Every other day, Suiyuan Daily dedicates six columns on page three to a "Letters from Reading Groups" column, exclusively publishing letters from reading groups. The "Letters from Reading Groups" column mainly provides political and ideological leadership to reading groups in the following four aspects:

    (1) "Notices" issued by the editorial department to reading groups. This is the most important method for the editorial department to lead reading group activities politically and ideologically. An average of five notices are issued each month. Its main function is to explain the political significance of current central movements, guide reading groups to conduct activities closely related to the central movements, and identify and criticize various incorrect ideas from the letters of the reading groups. This year, Suiyuan Province suffered from drought and frost disasters, and some people's thinking became chaotic. Based on this situation, the "Notice" explained the People's Government's responsible attitude towards the people and the principle of "Man will conquer nature," guiding reading groups to lead the masses in carrying out the production and disaster relief movement. The "Notice" also raises questions at any time in connection with the central work to organize reading groups to discuss. This approach can not only understand the people's thinking but also organize manuscripts in a timely manner. The "Notice" has played a significant role in guiding and inspecting reading group activities. For example, the model reading group, Li Liang Small Reading Group in Wudong County, challenged reading groups across the province. After the editorial department organized the challenge through the "Notice," nearly seven hundred reading groups responded to Li Liang Small Reading Group. After the movement was launched, the editorial department promptly issued "Notices" addressing formalism and certain ideological issues in the movement, providing specific guidance.

    (2) The editorial department compiles and publishes the report materials from the local Party committees of the CCP at the prefectural and county (city) levels (the Provincial Party Committee stipulates that local Party committees at the prefectural and county (city) levels report to the newspaper once a month) in the form of "Monthly Newsletter of Reading Groups." The content of this "Newsletter" includes: the development or reduction of reading groups in various places (number of groups, number of people, number of newspaper subscriptions), activity status, what major work the leadership organizations at all levels have done (such as running training courses for reading group leaders, convening representative meetings of reading group leaders), what major problems exist in the reading groups, how many letters (or manuscripts) the reading groups have written to the newspaper, and how they have been handled. The "Newsletter" commends good reading groups and criticizes leadership organs that do not pay attention to the work of reading groups. Through this activity, the newspaper office grasps the general situation and problems of reading groups throughout the province.

    (3) The editorial department summarizes and comments on a large number of letters from reading groups that are not suitable for separate publication in the newspaper, and publishes them in the newspaper. These processed letters are very ideological. Local Party committees at the prefectural and county (city) levels sometimes also use this method to send summarized letters from reading groups to the newspaper for publication. But overall, this form still accounts for very little weight on the newspaper.

    (4) The editorial department consciously promotes the experience of advanced reading groups through the newspaper to drive the general reading groups. The Li Liang Small Reading Group in Wudong County is a model reading group that pays attention to ideological leadership, and the Zhuanjingzhao Village Reading Group in Longsheng County is a group with strong organizational leadership. The newspaper's editorial department's introduction of the experiences of these typical groups has played a great role in promoting other reading groups.

    Vigorously developing the work of reading groups to strengthen the political and ideological education of the broad masses of the people is a major political task. The facts in many areas prove that regular reading and learning can improve the patriotic enthusiasm of the people and powerfully promote various tasks. In order to better lead the activities of reading groups, in addition to relying on the assistance of Party committees, governments, trade unions, and relevant leading departments at all levels, newspapers should assume the main responsibility for political and ideological leadership.　Reader's Letters Group of this Newspaper

    报纸应该加强对读报组的政治领导和思想领导
    ——介绍绥远日报领导
    读报组的经验
    报纸如何对广大读报组进行政治领导和思想领导，是一个值得重视和必须解决的问题。目前，各地报纸在报面上辟出专栏，以领导读报组活动的，除本报外，有：上海解放日报、绥远日报、青海日报、河北日报、山西日报、察哈尔日报、南京新华日报、新湖南报、青岛日报、云南日报、皖北日报、川西日报和川南日报。有些报纸，如上海解放日报、绥远日报，对读报组进行了及时的和有计划的领导。绥远日报的经验，是值得推行的。
    绥远日报每隔一天，在第三版上辟出六栏地位为“读报组来信”栏，专刊读报组的来信。“读报组来信”栏主要从以下四个方面，对读报组进行政治和思想领导：
    （一）编辑部发给读报组的“通知”。这是编辑部从政治上、思想上领导读报组活动的一个最主要的方法。每月平均发出五件。它的主要作用是阐述当前中心运动的政治意义，指导读报组紧密结合中心运动进行活动；并从读报组的来信中，发现和批判各种不正确的思想。今年绥远省遭受旱灾、冻灾，若干群众思想发生混乱。“通知”就根据这个情况，向大家说明人民政府对人民负责的态度和“人定胜天”的道理，指导读报组领导群众，开展生产救灾运动。“通知”并结合中心工作，随时提出问题，组织读报组进行讨论。这种作法，既能了解群众的思想情况，又能及时组织稿件。“通知”在指导和检查读报组活动方面，起了很大的作用。如模范读报组武东县李亮小读报组，向全省读报组提出挑战，经过编辑部“通知”的组织，有近七百个读报组向李亮小读报组应战。运动开展后，编辑部又针对运动中的形式主义和某些思想问题，及时发出“通知”，给以具体指导。
    （二）编辑部根据中共各地委县（市）委的汇报材料（中共省委规定各地委县（市）委每月向报社汇报一次），加以整理，用“每月读报组通报”的形式，在报上发表。这个“通报”的内容包括：各地读报组发展或减少情况（组数、人数、订报份数）、活动情况、各级领导机构做了那些主要的工作（如开办读报组长训练班、召开读报组长代表会议）、读报组中有些什么重大的问题、读报组向报社写了多少信（或稿）和处理情况等。“通报”表扬好的读报组，批评不重视读报组工作的领导机关。通过这种活动，报社掌握了全省读报组的一般情况和问题。
    （三）编辑部把不宜单独在报纸上发表的大批读报组来信，加以综合并提出意见，在报上发表。这种加工后的来信，思想性很强。各地委县（市）委有时也采用这种方式，把综合了的读报组来信，寄给报社发表。但整个说来，这种形式在报面上还只占很少的分量。
    （四）编辑部有意识地通过报纸，推广先进读报组的经验，以带动一般读报组。武东县李亮小读报组是一个注意思想领导的模范读报组，龙胜县转经召村读报组是一个组织领导很强的小组，报社编辑部介绍这些典型组的经验，对其他读报组起了很大的推动作用。
    大力开展读报组的工作，以加强广大人民的政治和思想教育，是一个重大的政治任务。不少地区的事实证明：经常地进行读报学习，可以提高人民群众的爱国热情，有力地推动各项工作。为了更好地领导读报组的活动，除了依靠各级党委、政府、工会和有关领导部门的协助外，报纸应当担负起政治和思想领导的主要责任。　本报读者来信组
