Combat Heroes in Czechoslovakia
箴　煜

At the invitation of the Ministry of National Defense of the Czechoslovak government, the delegation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which went to Czechoslovakia to participate in the celebration of the Czechoslovak Army Day, toured major cities throughout Czechoslovakia for a short period of more than twenty days in October, with the enthusiastic hospitality of the government, army, and people of the Czechoslovak Republic. From the Czechoslovak-Soviet border in the east to Pilsen in the west, from Bratislava in the south to Ostrava in the north, whether visiting factories, schools, rural areas, or touring scenic spots, the Czechoslovak people we saw were all working hard and burying themselves in the construction of their motherland. Red slogans encouraging labor enthusiasm were everywhere. When they learned that it was a delegation from the Chinese People's Army, they all ran over to shake hands and exchange greetings, shouting "Long live, Mao Zedong!" The innocent young Pioneers tied their red scarves, one by one, around the necks of the delegates, jumping and laughing. The most popular members of the delegation were the combat heroes. These model figures, who had won honors in battle, were cared for and loved everywhere they went. Wherever they went, the crowd flowed there.

On a clear, sunny morning, with the red sun rising and the air humid and warm, the delegation arrived in Ostrava. After getting off the plane, they were warmly received by local government, Party, army, workers, students, and citizens. At the welcome meeting, a factory manager introduced the many model workers and outstanding shock workers in the Stakhanovite movement from their factory to the delegation, including steelworkers who had completed their five-year plan in three years, excellent engineering designers, elderly lathe operators with graying temples, and young female production experts with bright eyes and white teeth. They all smiled serenely, displaying joy and glory. When the delegation introduced the combat heroes to them, all the arms in the audience were raised, and cheers and applause merged into one. Thousands of eyes were focused on the few people in the front row, and the medals hanging on their chests shone with a silver light. Heroes from different languages, different skin colors, and different positions had met! In the sunlit square, they hugged and shook hands, exchanged commemorative badges, and exchanged autographs. They laughed and talked heartily. Although they could not understand each other's words, their eyes were telling each other: "Close unity is strength, and we will surely be victorious." This was a common language, a common belief, and they all understood and smiled knowingly as they held hands tightly. The atmosphere at the meeting was so lively and full of friendship.

At the press conference held by the delegation in Prague, in addition to reporters from people's democratic countries, there were also many reporters from progressive newspapers in capitalist countries. After listening to the answers given by the head of the delegation, Liu Daosheng, they also interviewed the combat heroes in the delegation separately. The Greek journalist, a lean man with a rectangular face and brown hair, slightly myopic, wearing silver-rimmed glasses, was enthusiastic and gentle, and expressed great affection for Comrade Jiang Xueshan, head of the Tower Hill Hero Regiment. At the end of their formal conversation, the journalist took a notebook out of his coat pocket very carefully and asked Comrade Jiang Xueshan to write a few words. His tone was somewhat mournful as he spoke. He said that he had an old comrade, a progressive journalist, who had been arrested and imprisoned by the reactionary rulers in his country. He was very excited to be able to meet the heroes of the victorious Chinese People's Army today, but he could not help but think of this old comrade-in-arms, this indomitable warrior for peace, who was still living in the dark days of prison in his country. He said to Comrade Jiang, "Comrade, please express your feelings! For him, and for our cause." Then he handed over the notebook with both hands.

"Comrade!" Comrade Jiang wrote in his commemorative book: "As a soldier of the Chinese People's Army, I sympathize greatly with your plight.

An excellent soldier would rather die than surrender. We will use the resistance against America and aid to Korea to support you. The victors are not them, but us. I wish you good health." When the translator told him, the young man's eyes were filled with tears, and he hugged Comrade Jiang so tightly, and refused to separate for a long time.

The visit to Rovejo Vecese was also unforgettable. As soon as the delegation got out of the car, they were surrounded by young men and women from the army, government agencies, factories, and schools, as well as Young Pioneers. At a glance, there were green military uniforms, blue shirts, or white shirts and red scarves, and friendly smiles. In the warm early autumn sunset, everyone strolled up the mountain arm in arm, walking in neat steps, singing "How vast and wide is our motherland," "The Internationale," and "The March of the World's Democratic Youth" together. The songs in different languages floated in the clear sky, so harmonious and so powerful. They walked straight to the top of the mountain before sitting down to rest. The heroes and the male and female study models and excellent shooters of the Czechoslovak army exchanged souvenirs and signed autographs for each other, chatting in groups of three or five on the grass. Under the willow trees, young men and women from factories and schools and members of the delegation gathered together to dance Czech folk dances. Because the Chinese comrades did not know how to dance, they danced awkwardly, making everyone laugh. Later, several Chinese comrades danced the Yangko dance, and the Czech comrades followed suit. The hilltop was filled with enthusiasm, as if the distant peaks were also laughing.

On the way to Warsaw, the delegation visited Ostrava for the second time and visited the steel center under construction in Czechoslovakia's Five-Year Plan. When the delegation entered the factory, a man in his forties with a slight beard greeted them warmly, holding a newspaper in his hand, looking for someone everywhere, looking at this person, looking at that person. It turned out that the newspaper had already published Comrade Jiang Xueshan's photo and heroic deeds, and he was looking for him. Comrade Jiang's gaunt face was easy to find. When he found him, he held Comrade Jiang's hand very tightly, just smiling. Later, he raised a thumb and took out a pen and gave it to him. He didn't say a word the whole time. Until the delegation was about to leave, from the car window, you could still see this silent, seemingly stubborn man, standing at the door, staring motionless at the delegation. In the car, the translator said: He used to be an excellent steel worker. After February 1948, he became the head of a factory. Last winter, he was worried about the fate of the Korean people. It wasn't until the Chinese People's Volunteers went abroad and won the victory with the Korean People's Army that he smiled. When the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army advanced to near the 38th parallel this year, he was simply overjoyed. Although he did not say a word, he was extremely kind to the fighting Chinese people and army.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the respect and love that the victorious Chinese people and their army received abroad is indescribable. The people we came into contact with in Czechoslovakia, whether soldiers, workers, students, citizens, whether old ladies or little girls, gave us such a strong and kind impression. As the Air Force combat hero Yu Fuxiang said: "From the East to Prague, we traveled more than 20,000 miles, and everywhere we went, red flags were flying, everywhere people were building their happy future, everywhere we were greeted with smiles, and everywhere we were treated as family. With so many diligent, brave, and closely united people, who dares to come and mess with us? Let those robbers who are trying to launch a war dream on! Victory will always be ours."

    战斗英雄在捷克斯洛伐克
    箴　煜
    应捷克斯洛伐克政府国防部的邀请，赴捷参加捷陆军节庆祝典礼的中国人民解放军代表团，在捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府、军队和人民的热情款待下，在十月间短短的二十多天内游历了捷克斯洛伐克全国主要城市。代表团从东边捷苏国境线直到西部的比尔森，从南部的布拉的斯拉发到北方的俄斯特拉发，无论是参观工厂、学校、农村或是游览名胜古迹，所见到的捷克斯洛伐克人民，无一不是在努力工作，埋头于祖国的建设事业，到处都是鼓舞劳动热情的红色标语。当他们一知道是中国人民军队的代表来临时，都跑着围拢来，握手寒暄，高呼着“万岁，毛泽东！”天真的少年儿童队员把自己的红领巾，一条条拴在代表们的脖子上，蹦着笑着。代表团中最受人欢迎的是几位战斗英雄，这些在战斗中赢得荣誉的模范人物，到处都被人殷切地关怀和热爱着。他们走到那里，人潮就流向那里。
    在一个晴空万里，红日初升，潮湿而又温暖的早晨，代表团到达了俄斯特拉发。下飞机以后，受到当地政府、党、军队、工人、学生及市民的亲切接待。在欢迎大会上，一个工厂经理向代表团介绍了他们工厂的许多模范工作者和斯塔哈诺夫运动中的出色的突击队员，其中有三年完成五年计划的炼钢工人，有优秀的工程设计师，有双鬓斑白的老年镟工，有明眸皓齿的青年女生产能手，他们都安详地微笑着，表现出愉快和光荣。当代表团把几位战斗英雄向他们介绍时，全场的手臂都举了起来，欢呼声和掌声联成一片，成千双眼睛都集中在前排几个人的身上，挂在他们胸前的奖章在闪耀着银色光芒。不同语言、不同肤色、不同岗位上的英雄们会师了！在充满阳光的广场上，他们互相拥抱握手，交换纪念章，交换签字。他们纵情地谈笑，虽然说话听不懂，可是彼此的眼睛都在告诉对方：“紧密团结就是力量，我们一定能够胜利”。这是一句共同的语言，一个共同的信念，他们都明白，都紧握着手会心地笑了起来。会场显得那么活跃，那么充满了友爱的气氛。
    在布拉格代表团举行的记者招待会上，参加的除了人民民主国家的记者外，也有好多资本主义国家进步报纸的记者。他们在听完刘道生团长解答问题之后，又分别访问了代表团中的战斗英雄。希腊的新闻记者，是一个长方脸、棕色头发的削瘦的人，眼稍微有点近视，带着一付银框眼镜，热情恬静，对塔山英雄团团长江雪山同志表示非常亲切。在他们正式谈话结束时，这位记者同志很慎重地从大衣袋内拿出一个本子，要求江雪山同志题几个字。他说话时声调有些悲怆，他说他有一个老伙伴，进步的新闻工作者，被国内反动统治者逮捕入狱。他今天能和胜利了的中国人民军队的英雄们会面，感到非常兴奋，但却不由得想起这位老战友来，这位不屈不挠的和平战士，仍在国内过着暗无天日的铁窗生活。他向江同志说：“同志，请发表你的感想吧！为了他，也为了我们的事业。”接着双手把笔记簿递了过来。
    “同志！”江同志在他的纪念本上写道：“我作为一个中国人民军队的战士，非常同情你的遭遇。
    一个优秀的战士是宁死不屈的，我们将用抗美援朝来支援你。胜利者不是他们，而是我们。祝你健康。”当翻译讲给他听时，这位青年人眼里充满了泪珠，和江同志拥抱起来，是那么有力，好久好久不肯分开。
    在罗威乔维塞的访问，也是令人难以忘记的。代表团刚出车门，就被军队、机关、工厂、学校的男女青年团员和少先队员包围了。一眼望去都是碧绿的军装、蓝衬衣或是白衬衣和红领巾和亲切的笑容。在温暖的初秋的夕阳下大家联臂游山，踏着整齐的步伐，一齐唱“我们祖国多么辽阔广大”、“国际歌”、“世界民主青年进行曲”，语言不同的歌声，飘荡在晴空，是那么谐和，那么有力量。这样直走上山顶，才坐下来休息。英雄们和捷克斯洛伐克部队的男女学习模范、优秀射击手在交换纪念品，互相签字留念，三五成群在草地上谈笑着。柳荫下，工厂学校的男女青年和代表团员围拢来，一块跳捷克的民间舞蹈，因为中国同志不会跳，一歪一扭，惹得全场都大笑起来。后来有几个中国同志扭起秧歌舞来，捷克同志也就跟着扭，山顶上洋溢着热情，好像远处的山峰也在欢笑。
    在去华沙的途中，代表团二次访问了俄斯特拉发，参观了捷克斯洛伐克五年计划建设中的钢铁中心。当代表团进入工厂时，一个四十来岁微有胡须的人，热情地招呼着，手里拿着一张报纸，到处找人，看看这个，看看那个。原来报纸上已把江雪山同志的照片和英雄事迹登出来了，他在找他。江同志削瘦的面孔很好找，他找到时把江同志的手握得很紧，只是笑，后来跷了一个大拇指，并把自己的一枝钢笔拿出来送了他。他始终没说一句话，直到代表团临走时，在车窗里还可以看见这位沉默的看来有些倔强的人，站在门口，一动不动地望着代表团。在车上翻译同志说：他原来是一个优秀的钢铁工人，在一九四八年二月后，他成为一个厂的负责人。去年冬天，他曾为朝鲜人民的命运忧虑过，直到中国人民志愿军出国和朝鲜人民军一起打了胜仗，他面上才挂了笑容。当今年中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军推进到三八线附近时，他简直乐得手舞足蹈了。他虽然没有说一句话，但对战斗着的中国人民和军队是异常亲切的。
    在毛主席领导下，胜利了的中国人民及其军队，在国外所受到的尊敬和热爱，是无法形容的。在捷克斯洛伐克接触过的人们，无论是军人、工人、学生、市民，无论是老太太和小姑娘，给人的印象都是如此强烈，如此亲切。正如空军战斗英雄于福祥同志所说：“我们从东方直到布拉格，行程两万多里，到处都飘扬着鲜红的旗帜，到处都在建设自己的美满将来，到处对我们都是笑脸相迎，到处都亲如家人。我们有这么多勤劳勇敢紧密团结的人，谁敢来我们头上动土？让那些企图发动战争的强盗做梦吧！胜利永远是我们的。”　（新华社）
