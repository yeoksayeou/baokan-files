[Beijing News Agency News] The Third Session of the Third Beijing People's Representative Conference opened yesterday (28th) at 9:00 AM in Zhongshan Hall, Zhongshan Park. The main content of this meeting is to discuss increasing production and practicing thrift, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy. Through this meeting, the people of the city will be further mobilized to vigorously and swiftly carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

After the meeting began, Chairman Peng Zhen of the Municipal Consultative Committee gave a report. Chairman Peng Zhen first reported on the city's achievements in increasing production and practicing thrift this year. He said: The people of the city have responded to Chairman Mao's call and have already made many achievements in the production increase and thrift campaign. According to statistics from only twenty public factories and mines, a total of 363.5 billion yuan of wealth has been saved for the country. The increase in production of private industries is also more than 300 billion yuan. In the suburbs, agricultural production has generally increased by 5 to 10 percent compared to last year. Regarding the launching of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Chairman Peng Zhen said: Beijing's mass anti-corruption and anti-waste movement has initially begun. Some staff members with corrupt practices have confessed in their own units, and the Municipal People's Government has received many letters reporting corruption. The business community has begun to launch a movement against corruption and bribery. The scale of the movement is very large. However, as a large-scale mass movement, this movement is not deep or widespread enough at present. In his report, Chairman Peng Zhen also analyzed the causes of corruption and pointed out the correct attitude to be taken towards corruption. He said: We must never condone corruption; we can only resolutely eliminate it. Regarding how to further develop the movement, Chairman Peng Zhen put forward the principle of combining leadership with the masses, as well as methods such as mutual inspection by organs at the same level and mobilizing the masses from all aspects to report corruption. Chairman Peng Zhen said: With the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, with a large number of cadres who have been tempered for a long time and are honest and dedicated as the backbone, and with the support of the broad masses of the people, we will definitely be able to eradicate corruption. In addition, Chairman Peng Zhen also analyzed the dangers of waste and bureaucratic style. He said: Extravagance and waste in life are close to corruption, and the bureaucratic style is a breeding ground for corruption and waste, and must be eliminated in this movement. Chairman Peng Zhen called on those with corruption, waste, or bribery to confess and examine themselves. He called on the people of the city to expose corrupt elements and assist the People's Government in completely eliminating corruption and waste.

After Chairman Peng Zhen's report, Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Federation, gave a report on the Beijing Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country Movement. He said: More than 90 percent of the people in the city have received patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. 1,695,538 people signed in support of the Five Great Powers concluding a peace pact. 1,694,563 people voted against the United States arming Japan. 1,402,485 people signed patriotic pacts. The weapon donation plan of people from all walks of life has been overfulfilled. As of December 25, the actual payment reached 127.1 billion yuan, which can buy 84 fighter planes, exceeding the original subscribed amount by more than 22 percent. Chairman Zhang Xiruo announced at the meeting that the donation work has been successfully completed. He hoped that all units would conscientiously summarize this work and learn from experience in order to actively carry out the production increase and thrift campaign. He said: In order to continue to strengthen resistance against the US and aid to Korea, and to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, it is necessary to continue to conduct patriotic education extensively and deeply; to review and revise patriotic pacts; and to do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers; the most important thing is to launch a large-scale production increase and thrift campaign.

Wu Han, Chairman of the Fourth People's Representative Conference Representative Election Committee, gave a "Report on Preparing for the Election of Representatives to the Fourth Beijing People's Representative Conference." He said: After the Municipal Election Committee was established on December 23, it has already started working. Based on the experience of the representative election work last year, it was decided: First, to prepare for the election work early, to establish election committees at all levels before the New Year, and to allow all units to conduct election work calmly according to their specific circumstances in about a month; second, election committees at all levels should establish propaganda agencies, and use newspapers, radio broadcasts, and reports to vigorously promote the powers of the representative conference and the tasks of the representatives in a planned and systematic manner, combined with the central tasks of the country and the construction work of the capital; election committees at all levels should not only do a good job in the election work, but also further improve the political awareness of the broad masses of citizens and strengthen their love for the motherland and their concern for the construction of the people's capital through this work; third, to improve election committees at all levels and strengthen leadership, and to promptly discover and solve problems, and establish a regular reporting system and inspection system.

Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Consultative Committee, gave a "Report on Proposal Review." He said: In order to review the proposals more meticulously and save the time of the conference, this conference adopted the method of collecting proposals before the meeting and organizing special groups by the Consultative Committee to prepare review opinions. This conference received a total of 901 proposals, which were merged into 294 cases after merging cases of the same nature. When reviewing the proposals, the special groups of the Consultative Committee and the Review Committee repeatedly consulted with the competent departments, and then put forward review opinions. Regarding the handling of proposals, the Review Committee suggested: cases involving major issues should be submitted to the conference for discussion; cases that should be handled and can be handled should be sent to the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Consultative Committee for verification; cases that should be handled but cannot be handled immediately should be sent to the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Consultative Committee for attention and reference; cases that cannot be handled should not be sent to the Municipal People's Government.

    讨论开展增产节约反对贪污浪费运动
    京各界人民代表会议开幕
    彭真主席号召全市人民检举贪污分子
    【北京市新闻处讯】北京市第三届第三次各界人民代表会议昨（二十八）日上午九时在中山公园中山堂开幕。这次会议内容，主要是讨论增产节约，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义问题；经过这次会议，进一步动员全市人民大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    大会开始后，由市协商委员会主席彭真作报告，彭真主席首先报告了今年全市的增产节约成绩。他说：全市人民响应毛主席的号召，已经在增产节约运动中做出很多成绩。仅据二十个公营工厂和矿场的统计，共已为国家节约了三千六百三十五亿元的财富。私营工业增产数量也在三千多亿元以上。市郊农产一般较去年多收了半成到一成。关于开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的问题。彭真主席说：北京市群众性反对贪污、反对浪费运动已初步展开，有些有贪污行为的工作人员已在本单位坦白，市人民政府已经收到不少检举贪污的信件；工商界已开始发动反贪污、反行贿的运动。运动的规模是很大的。但是做为一个大规模的群众运动来说，这个运动在目前还是不够深入和普遍的。彭真主席在报告中并分析了产生贪污现象的原因，指出了对于贪污现象应抱的正确态度。他说：我们决不能纵容贪污，我们只能坚决消灭它。关于如何进一步开展运动，彭真主席提出了领导和群众相结合的原则，以及同级机关互相检查和发动各方面群众检举等办法。彭真主席说：有毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导，有大批久经锻炼、廉洁奉公的干部作骨干，有广大人民群众的支持，我们是一定能够把贪污现象铲除的。此外，彭真主席还对浪费现象和官僚主义作风的危害性进行了分析。他说：生活上的铺张浪费是接近于贪污的，而官僚主义作风就是产生贪污、浪费现象的温床，都必须在这次运动中加以肃清。彭真主席号召有贪污浪费现象或行贿行为的人，自己坦白，自己检讨。他号召全市人民检举贪污分子，协助人民政府，彻底消灭贪污浪费现象。
    彭真主席报告之后，市抗美援朝分会主席张奚若作了关于北京市抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告。他说：全市已有百分之九十以上的人民受到了抗美援朝爱国主义的教育。签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约的有一百六十九万五千五百三十八人。投票反对美国武装日本的有一百六十九万四千五百六十三人。签订爱国公约的有一百四十万二千四百八十五人。各界人民的武器捐献计划已经超额完成。到十二月二十五日为止，实际缴款的已达一千二百七十一亿元，可买战斗机八十四架，超过原来认捐数目百分之二十二强。张奚若主席在会上宣布：捐献工作已胜利结束。他希望各单位认真总结这一工作，吸取经验，以便积极开展增产节约运动。他说：为了继续加强抗美援朝，支持中国人民志愿军，必须继续广泛与深入进行爱国主义教育；检查修订爱国公约；做好优待烈属、军属等工作；最主要的是大规模地展开增产节约运动。
    第四届各界人民代表会议代表选举委员会主任委员吴晗在会上作了“关于筹备北京市第四届各界人民代表会议代表选举工作的报告”。他说：市选举委员会在十二月二十三日成立后，已经开始工作，根据去年代表选举工作的经验，决定：第一，要提早准备选举工作，在新年以前，普遍建立各级选举委员会，各单位在一个月左右的时间内，可以按照自己的具体情况，从容地进行选举工作；第二，各级选举委员会都要建立宣传机构，运用报纸、电台广播和报告会等方式，结合国家的中心任务和首都的各项建设工作，有计划有系统地大力宣传代表会议的职权和代表的任务；各级选举委员会不但要做好选举工作，而且要通过这项工作，进一步提高广大市民的政治认识，加强对祖国的热爱和对人民首都建设事业的关怀；第三，健全各级选举委员会，加强领导，要求做到及时发现问题和解决问题，建立定期的汇报制度和检查制度。
    市协商委员会副主席钱端升在会上作了“关于提案审查的报告”。他说：为了更缜密地审查提案和节省大会时间，这次会议采取了会前征集提案、由协商委员会组织专门小组准备审查意见的办法。这次会议共收到提案九百零一件，将性质相同的案件合并后，成为二百九十四件。审查提案时，协商委员会的各专门小组和审查委员会均与主管部门反复协商，然后提出审查意见。对于提案的处理，审查委员会建议：凡涉及重大问题的案件，提交大会讨论；应当办又可能办的案件，分别送请市人民政府、市协商委员会核办；应当办而不能即办的案件，分别送请市人民政府、市协商委员会注意、参考；不能办的案件即一律不送交市人民政府。
    接着，由北京市都市计划委员会副主任委员梁思成提出了关于首都建设计划的初步意见，在他发言之后，大会即休会。下午举行分组讨论。今日上午继续分组讨论，下午举行大会。
    昨日大会出席代表共三百九十三人，大会执行主席为聂荣臻、刘仁、余心清、林汉达、林砺儒、陈垣、朱长江、杨蕴玉。来宾有中央人民政府政务院政务委员邵力子等。
