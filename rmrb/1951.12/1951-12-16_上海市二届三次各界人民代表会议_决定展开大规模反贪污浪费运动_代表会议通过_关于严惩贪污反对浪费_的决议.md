Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 15th: A large-scale, vigorous anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign is about to be launched throughout Shanghai. This was decided by the Third Session of the Second Shanghai People's Representative Conference.

The Third Session of the Second Shanghai People's Representative Conference was held from December 10th to 15th. During the conference, Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, attended and gave a speech. More than 800 representatives, in small group discussions and plenary speeches, discussed how to implement the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai. The representatives unanimously pointed out that continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, and carrying out the ideological remolding movement are the major current tasks of the Shanghai people, and expressed full confidence in mobilizing the city's people to do a good job in the three central tasks in the future.

This conference focused on the issue of anti-corruption and anti-waste. Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi, in his opening speech, called for launching a vigorous anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign throughout the city. Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, pointed out in his speech to the conference: The Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting arduously on the Korean front to defend the motherland, workers and peasants across the country are working day and night in production and construction, and our People's Liberation Army and government personnel are serving the people wholeheartedly. They – the people in various work positions in our motherland – absolutely cannot allow these pests – corrupt elements – to steal our national wealth and undermine our national construction.

The call of Chairman Rao Shushi and Mayor Chen Yi was warmly supported by representatives from all walks of life, who unanimously agreed that anti-corruption and anti-waste is the central link in the current increase production and practice economy movement. In two days of small group discussions and two days of plenary speeches, the representatives exposed many facts of corruption and waste. The representatives unanimously agreed that corruption and waste are the deadly enemies of increasing production and practicing economy; only by eliminating corruption and waste can we ensure that the wealth generated from increasing production and practicing economy is fully used to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and national construction. All representatives present at the meeting put forward their specific methods and opinions on doing a good job in the three central tasks in their speeches. Representative Hu Zongyao said: Waste is very serious in our factory, and there is also corruption, but administrative personnel are unaware of it, so while opposing corruption and waste, we must also oppose bureaucracy. Representatives from industry and commerce, Wu Zhenshan and Zhao Tirun, sharply pointed out: We must oppose the dregs of industry and commerce, who use various methods to entice government officials into engaging in corruption and bribery. This issue aroused serious attention from representatives from all walks of life during the discussion. Because some corruption cases exposed at the meeting and some corruption cases that have been punished by the Shanghai People's Court, such as the corruption case of Lu Xingyuan, former director of the technical department of the East China People's Broadcasting Station, powerfully demonstrate that much of the corruption of government officials is related to illegal businessmen, and much of it is caused by the enticement and bribery of illegal businessmen. Therefore, the representatives believe that today's anti-corruption movement must also fight against illegal businessmen and must punish those illegal businessmen who entice government officials to engage in corruption according to law. Some representatives also suggested that in the anti-corruption movement, we must draw a clear line between us and corrupt elements who steal national wealth, mobilize the masses throughout the city to report corrupt elements, and ensure that corrupt elements are punished by law and not allowed to go unpunished. Regarding the issue of reporting corrupt elements, women's representative He Yuzhen pointed out: It is incorrect to think that anti-corruption has nothing to do with women, because wives always know about many of the corruption facts of their corrupt husbands. Therefore, women must participate in the anti-corruption movement and report corrupt husbands.

The conference finally passed the "Resolution on Severely Punishing Corruption and Opposing Waste," deciding to launch a vigorous anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign throughout the city. The conference called on the people of the city to actively participate in this movement, report and expose corrupt elements, expose and oppose extravagance and waste, and strive for victory in the fight against corruption and waste!

    上海市二届三次各界人民代表会议
    决定展开大规模反贪污浪费运动
    代表会议通过“关于严惩贪污反对浪费”的决议
    【新华社上海十五日电】一个大规模的大张旗鼓的反对贪污、反对浪费运动，即将在上海市普遍展开。这是上海市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议决定的。
    上海市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议在十二月十日至十五日举行。会议期间，华东军政委员会主席饶漱石曾到会讲话。八百多位代表在小组座谈、大会发言中，讨论了怎样在上海市贯彻中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议决议的问题。代表们一致指出：继续加强抗美援朝运动、开展增产节约运动、开展思想改造运动是上海人民的当前的重大任务，并对今后动员全市人民做好三大中心工作有充分信心。
    这次会议着重地讨论了反对贪污、反对浪费的问题。上海市长陈毅在开会词中号召要在全市大张旗鼓地开展反贪污反浪费运动。华东军政委员会主席饶漱石在向大会讲话时指出：中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线艰苦作战保卫着祖国，全国工人和农民在日以继夜地进行生产建设，我们的人民解放军和机关工作人员在全心全意地为人民服务，他们——我们祖国各种工作岗位上的人民，绝不能够容许这些害虫——贪污分子盗窃我们国家的财富，破坏我们国家的建设。
    饶漱石主席和陈毅市长的号召获得了各界代表的热烈的拥护，大家一致认为反贪污浪费是当前增产节约运动的中心环节。代表们在两天的小组讨论和两天的大会发言中揭发了许多贪污浪费的事实。代表们一致认为：贪污浪费是增产节约的死敌；只有消灭了贪污浪费现象，才能保证增产节约来的财富完全用在支持中国人民志愿军和国家建设上。到会的所有代表在发言中，都提出了自己对于做好三大中心工作的具体办法和意见。代表胡宗耀说：我们工厂中浪费现象很严重，贪污现象也有，但行政人员却心中无数，所以在反贪污反浪费的同时，必须反对官僚主义。工商界代表吴振珊、赵体润都尖锐地指出：我们要反对工商界的败类，他们以各种办法勾引政府机关工作人员进行贪污舞弊的行为。这一问题在讨论中引起了各界代表的严重注意。因为在会议上揭发的一些贪污案件及上海市人民法院已经惩办的一些贪污案件，如前华东人民广播电台机务主任路星元贪污案等，都有力地说明：政府机关工作人员的贪污很多是与不法商人有关系，很多是由于不法商人的勾引、贿赂所造成，因此，代表们认为今天反贪污运动也必须与不法商人做斗争，必须以法律惩办那些勾引机关工作人员进行贪污的不法商人。还有的代表提出在反贪污运动中必须与盗窃国家财富的贪污分子划清界线，在全市范围内发动群众检举贪污分子，务须使贪污分子受到法律制裁，不让他逍遥法外。对于检举贪污分子问题，妇女界代表何宇珍指出：认为反贪污与妇女没有关系是不正确的，因为许多贪污的丈夫的贪污事实，妻子总是会晓得的。因此妇女一定要参加反贪污运动，并且要检举贪污的丈夫。
    会议最后通过了“关于严惩贪污、反对浪费”的决议，决定在全市大张旗鼓地开展反贪污反浪费运动。会议号召全市人民积极参加这一运动，告发与检举贪污分子，揭发与反对铺张浪费现象，争取反贪污浪费斗争的胜利！
