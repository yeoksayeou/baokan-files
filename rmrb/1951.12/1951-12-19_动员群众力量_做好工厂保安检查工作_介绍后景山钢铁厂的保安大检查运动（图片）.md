    Mobilizing the Power of the Masses to Do a Good Job in Factory Security Inspection Work
    -- Introducing the Security Inspection Campaign at the Houjingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    In order to implement the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government on eliminating accidents and ensuring safe production in factories, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant launched a comprehensive security inspection campaign throughout the plant starting in the fall of this year. The results and practical education obtained through this campaign have greatly improved the workers' production enthusiasm. For example, the production volume of pipes in the foundry workshop increased by 30% compared to before the security inspection campaign. This is the scene of Director Zhou giving an ideological mobilization report to all employees at the security inspection mobilization meeting.
    In the course of the campaign, the method of recalling accidents with real people and real events was used to educate the masses, so that workers could more clearly understand the importance of security inspection work ideologically. This is a worker (whose left leg has been fitted with an artificial leg) recounting the details of his past injury in an accident at the accident recollection meeting.
    Fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the strength of the masses is the basic key to solving the problem of safe production in factories. The entire factory inspected and workers actively put forward more than 10,000 safety issues that needed to be improved, which provided extremely favorable conditions for doing a good job in factory safety and labor protection. This is the scene of workers carefully checking and discovering that the screws of the cast pipe machine base were disengaged, thus avoiding a major accident.
    Responsible personnel from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League often go deep into the front lines to conduct investigations and research together with the workers in order to understand the specific situation and discover problems, so as to discover and deal with problems in a timely manner. This is the scene of responsible personnel from the administration and trade union studying problems with the workers on the spot.
    In this security inspection campaign, the installation of safety protection equipment on all machines in the factory has been basically resolved, depending on the severity and urgency of the situation and under possible economic conditions. This is the scene of workers performing safe operations after the gear cover has been installed. Workers can better exert their labor enthusiasm when operating under such improved equipment conditions.
    The areas around machines that did not have railings in the past have been fitted with iron railings using waste materials through the efforts of the workers during this campaign, protecting the safety of workers' lives.
    In the past, the quarry often had unfortunate accidents in which quarry workers were injured or killed because there were no good safety devices. In this campaign, after research, the workers created a method of attaching safety ropes when working on high mountains (drilling a hole in the stone, inserting an iron bar, and then tying one end of the rope to the iron bar and the other end to the person), eliminating the danger of operating at heights. This is the scene of quarry workers attaching safety ropes and quarrying on the mountainside. (Photo by Cai Yuli of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant)
    In the past, cooperation between technical personnel and workers was not close enough, so many of the various operating systems formulated by technical personnel in the past could not meet the actual situation, were reduced to formalities, and could not be implemented well. After this campaign, technical personnel often went deep into the front lines to study and revise with the workers and establish practical technical operating procedures, safety technical operating procedures and other systems, making safety work a regular task. This is the scene of technical personnel and workers in the foundry workshop discussing and revising and establishing systems.
    Most of the locomotives in the factory did not have lighting equipment, so not only were traffic accidents prone to occur, but work efficiency was also very low. However, after this security inspection campaign, the workers used the steam of the locomotives to install generators, solving the locomotive lighting problem that had not been solved for many years.
    Workers in the benzene production (coking by-product) workshop are easily harmed by benzene volatilization, which can damage their health. Workers also took the initiative to propose improvement measures in this security inspection campaign, installing glass tubes on the iron lids of benzene containers, and then installing floats inside the glass tubes. This seals the containers and basically solves the problem of benzene poisoning for workers.
    In this security inspection campaign, cleaning and sanitation work was also done well, and the roofs of blast furnaces and other remote places that had not been cleaned for a long time were thoroughly cleaned. In this cleaning, more than 120 tons of dust were swept down from the roofs of only two blast furnaces. This is the scene of workers cleaning dust on the roofs of blast furnaces more than 20 meters high.
    During the campaign, workers throughout the factory enthusiastically launched a "eliminate American Imperialism and remove red cards" competition, giving full play to the workers' high creativity and enthusiasm. Under the principle of making full use of waste materials and not affecting normal production work, the workers themselves solved more than 50% of the problems related to machine safety and protective equipment throughout the factory. This is the scene of workers enthusiastically removing red cards after thinking of solutions to problems.
    In order to take care of the nutrition of workers engaged in work that is harmful to their health, the factory gives each person one pound of soy milk every day. This is the scene of workers working at high temperatures drinking soy milk.
    After wage adjustments and security inspections, the lives and safety of workers throughout the factory have been guaranteed. Therefore, the workers eliminated their ideological worries about being unemployed, sick, or injured and no one caring for them, and voluntarily handed over the valuable equipment they had collected in the past. This is the scene of a worker handing over a theodolite that had been buried underground for many years to the workshop management cadre.
    In the past, because the factory's equipment was incomplete, workers often ate cold food, which had a great impact on their health. This time, the workers used broken and leaky oil drums to make steamers after repairing them, and then used the steam from water furnaces and boilers to steam rice, so that all the workers could eat hot meals.
    In order to thoroughly do a good job in safe production, the workers also tried their best to solve some minor problems. This is the method of improving the switch for high-altitude steam cutoff valves, avoiding the danger of climbing operations in the past.
    In order to take care of the traffic safety of workers on the night shift, the factory decided to install street lights on all traffic routes. In order to assist the factory in completing this task, the electrical workers installed 325 street lights in two days without affecting normal production work, saving the country equipment worth more than 100 million yuan.

    动员群众力量  做好工厂保安检查工作
    ——介绍后景山钢铁厂的保安大检查运动
    石景山钢铁厂为了贯彻中央人民政府重工业部消灭事故、做好工厂安全生产工作的指示，从今年秋季起全厂展开了保安大检查运动。通过这一运动所获得的成果和实际教育，大大地提高了工人们的生产情绪，其中如铸造车间的管子生产量即比较保安大检查以前提高了百分之三十。这是周厂长在保安大检查动员大会上向全厂职工进行思想动员报告时的情形。
    在运动进行中并利用真人真事回忆事故的办法来教育群众，使工人们在思想上更明确地认识到保安检查工作的重要性。这是某工人（左腿已安装了假腿）在回忆事故大会上讲述自己过去因事故受伤经过的情形。
    充分发动群众和依靠群众的力量，是解决工厂安全生产问题的基本关键。全厂经过检查和工人们踊跃提出需要改进的安全问题共达一万余件，使做好工厂安全及劳动保护工作获得了极有利的条件。这是工人们认真检查出铸管机座螺丝脱扣，因而避免了发生重大事故的情形。
    党、行政、工会、青年团的负责人员为了了解具体情况和发现问题，经常深入现场和工人们共同进行调查研究，以便及时发现和处理问题。这是行政和工会的负责人员在现场和工人们互相研究问题时的情形。
    在这次保安大检查运动中，全厂所有机器上的安全防护设备的装置工作，分别轻重缓急和在可能的经济条件下，基本上都已得到解决。这是工人在已经装置好牙轮罩子后进行安全操作时的情形。工人们在这种设备已经改善的条件下进行操作，就可以更好地发挥他们的劳动积极性。
    过去没有装置栏杆的机器周围，在这次运动中，经过工人们的努力，也都利用废料装起了铁栏杆，保护了工人生命的安全。
    采石场过去因为没有很好的安全设备，所以时常发生采石工人摔伤或摔死的不幸事故。在这次运动中，工人们经过研究后，创造了高山工作时拴上安全绳的办法（在石上凿一孔，插一铁棍，然后用绳的一端缚在铁棍上，另一端缚在人身上），解除了高处操作的危险。这是采石工人拴上安全绳正在山腰进行采石时的情形。（石景山钢铁厂蔡毓礼摄）
    过去技术人员和工人之间的合作是不够密切的，因而技术人员过去所拟订的各种操作制度，很多不能切合实际，流于形式，不能很好地贯彻实行。经过这次运动后，技术人员经常深入现场与工人进行研究修订和建立了切合实际的技术操作规程、安全技术操作规程等制度，使保安工作成为一项经常性的工作。这是铸造车间技术人员和工人在讨论修订及建立制度时的情形。
    全厂大部分机车没有照明设备，因此不但容易发生车祸，而且工作效率也很低，但是经过这次保安大检查运动以后，工人们利用机车的蒸汽安装上发电机，解决了多年来没有解决过的机车照明问题。
    制苯（炼焦的副产品）工场工人，因苯的发挥容易使工人的健康遭受损失。工人们在这次保安大检查运动中也主动地提出了改进办法，从苯的容器铁盖上装置了玻璃管，再从玻璃管内加装浮标，这样可以使容器密封，基本上解决了工人因苯中毒的问题。
    在这次保安大检查运动中，同时也做好了清洁卫生工作，使长期没有清扫过的高炉棚顶和其它偏僻地方也都打扫得干干净净。在这次清扫中仅仅在两个高炉棚顶上就扫下了一百二十多吨灰尘。这是工人们正在二十多公尺高的高炉棚顶上清扫灰尘的情景。
    全厂工人在运动中，热烈地展开了“消灭美帝摘红牌”竞赛，发挥了工人们高度的创造性和积极性，在尽量利用废料和不影响正常生产工作的原则下，由工人们自己解决了全厂百分之五十以上的有关机器安全及防护设备等问题。这是工人们想到了问题的解决办法之后正在热烈地摘取红牌时的情形。
    厂方为了照顾有害身体健康工作工人的营养，每人每天发给豆浆一磅。这是高温作业工人在喝豆浆时的情形。
    全厂工人经过调整工资及保安大检查后，生活和安全都得到了保障。因此，工人们消除了思想上怕失业、生病、受伤后无人理会的顾虑，自动把过去收藏的珍贵器材献交出来。这是工人把埋藏在地下已经多年的经纬仪一架献交给工场主管干部时的情形。
    过去因为工厂设备不齐全，工人时常吃冷饭，对于身体健康的影响很大。这次工人利用破漏油桶经过修补后做成蒸锅，再利用水炉和锅炉的蒸汽蒸饭，使工人们都可以吃到热饭。
    为了彻底做好安全生产工作，工人们对于一些细小问题也尽力想办法来解决。这是工人改进了开关高处蒸汽截门的方法，避免了过去登高操作的危险。
    厂方为了照顾夜班工人的交通安全，全厂各交通路线决定安装路灯。电气工人们为了协助厂方完成这个任务，在不影响正常生产工作的条件下，两天内就装好了三百二十五盏路灯，给国家节省了价值一亿余元的器材。
