Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 21st: At the staff officers' meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks on the 21st, in order to dispel all concerns and excuses of the other party on the rotation issue, our side proposed to amend the fourth principle in our December 14th proposal as follows: "In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice and facilitate the high-level political conference between the two sides, both sides guarantee that no military forces, military personnel, war equipment, and ammunition will enter Korea from outside Korea during the armistice period. The rotation within the limits agreed by both parties shall be reported to the Armistice Commission so that the neutral nations supervisory and inspection agencies can conduct supervision and inspection at the rear ports agreed by both parties." However, the other party still insisted on interfering in our internal affairs, restricting the restoration and construction of our equipment during the armistice period, and conducting aerial reconnaissance over our airspace. Our staff sternly pointed out: Our representative has repeatedly stated in the general assembly and in the subcommittee that how our side handles all equipment within Korea is an internal matter, and the integrity of the airspace is an inviolable sovereignty of an independent country, which cannot be trifled with, interfered with, or undermined by anyone. Our side will absolutely not accept any agreement that includes interference in our internal affairs. Unless the other party abandons its unreasonable demand for interference in our internal affairs, the meeting cannot make any progress. The staff officers' meeting, at the suggestion of the other party and with the consent of our side, is scheduled to continue at 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd. The third agenda item subcommittee has been postponed to 2:00 p.m. on the 22nd. Furthermore, the other party notified that the fourth agenda item subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 11:00 a.m. on the 22nd.

    在第三项议程双方参谋人员会议上
    我方建议把我方第四项原则加以修正美方竟仍坚持干涉我内政的无理要求
    【新华社开城二十一日电】在二十一日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程双方参谋人员会议中，我方为解除对方在轮换问题上的一切顾虑和藉口，建议将我方十二月十四日方案中的第四项原则修正如下：“为保证军事停战的稳定，以利双方高一级的政治会议的进行，双方保证在停战期间不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事部队、军事人员、战争装备和弹药。双方协议限度内的轮换，应报告停战委员会，以便委托中立国监督视察机构在双方同意的后方口岸，进行监督与视察。”但对方却仍然坚持干涉我内政，坚持在停战期间限制我方设备的恢复与修建，并在我方领空进行空中侦察。我方参谋严正指出：我方代表已在大会中与小组委员会中一再声明，我方如何处理朝鲜境内的一切设备都属于内部问题，领空的完整更是独立国家不可侵犯的主权，不容任何人玩弄、干涉与破坏。我方绝对不会接受任何包含干涉我方内政的协定。除非对方放弃其干涉内政的无理要求，则会议不能有所进展。参谋人员会议经对方建议我方同意定于二十二日上午十时继续举行。第三项议程小组委员会，延期至二十二日下午二时再行召开。又对方通知第四项议程小组委员会定于二十二日上午十一时举行。
