    Blind Development of Rice Processing Plants in Linchuan County Leads to Waste
    To the Editor: Linchuan County, Fuzhou Special District, Jiangxi Province, has blindly developed rice processing plants, resulting in wasted idle machinery. Linchuan County has fourteen rice processing plants, nine of which are state-owned and five of which are privately owned. According to statistics, Linchuan County currently has a total of 288 horsepower of processing machinery, producing 167,000 jin of rice daily, and approximately 5 million jin per month. However, due to insufficient raw material supply, many factories are shut down for ten days or half a month each month. The main reason for this phenomenon is the departmentalism of the relevant units. They believe that processing themselves can bring some surplus, and some even do it to solve the problem of bran and broken rice feed for raising pigs. I believe that the relevant departments of Fuzhou Special District should make reasonable adjustments to the rice processing plants under their jurisdiction based on the supply of raw materials, in order to improve the utilization rate of existing machinery and equipment.

    临川县盲目发展加工米厂造成浪费
    编辑同志：江西省抚州专区临川县盲目发展加工米厂，造成了机器闲置的浪费现象。临川县有十四家加工米厂，其中公营的有九家，私营的有五家。根据统计，临川县现有的加工机器共二百八十八匹马力，每天出产九二米十六万七千斤，每月可出产五百万斤左右。但因原料供应不上，很多工厂一个月里停工十天或半个月。产生这种现象的主要原因，是各有关单位的本位主义思想。他们认为自己开厂加工，可有一部分盈余，个别的甚至是为了解决养猪的糠、碎米等饲料问题。我认为抚州专区有关部门应根据原料供给情况，对所属各单位的加工米厂作一合理调整，以便提高现有机器设备的利用率。
