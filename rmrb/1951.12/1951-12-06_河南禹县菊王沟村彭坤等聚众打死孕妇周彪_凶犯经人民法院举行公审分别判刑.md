In Jukanggou Village, Yuxian County, Henan Province, on September 8th, a case occurred where twenty-one people collectively beat pregnant woman Zhou Biao to death. On September 30th, the Yuxian County People's Court held a public trial and sentenced the principal offenders Yuan Xirong and Peng Kun to death. Other criminals were also sentenced to imprisonment for varying terms.

The victim, Zhou Biao, was twenty years old this year and from Sangudong Township, Yuxian County. Since childhood, her parents arranged a marriage with Peng Yong (a poor peasant) from Jukanggou Village, Xingshanpo Township, Ninth District of the same county. She was forced to marry him last winter. Before her marriage, Zhou Biao was an active participant in the land reform movement and had a very progressive mindset. Peng Yong's thinking, however, was very backward. After marriage, the couple's relationship was disharmonious, and Zhou Biao was often beaten and scolded by her mother-in-law and husband, and was restricted from going out or participating in any social activities. Zhou Biao felt very distressed and had several times proposed to Wang Dian, the peasant representative of Jukanggou Village, that she wanted to divorce Peng Yong. Wang Dian never paid attention to it. On September 7th this year, the old revolutionary base area visiting delegation held a mass meeting in Sangudong Township. Zhou Biao secretly ran to the meeting place, wanting to complain to the district cadres and request a divorce. However, she was afraid of being seen by the Peng family, which would cause trouble. Therefore, she sat in front of the stage and did not dare to go on stage. Halfway through the meeting, it rained heavily, and as a result, she was unable to voice her grievances. This time, Zhou Biao's participation in the meeting was seen by members of the Peng family clan, who went back and told her mother-in-law Yuan Xirong, her husband Peng Yong, and her husband's elder brother Peng Kun. Yuan Xirong and her two sons discussed, saying, "Zhou Biao is definitely going to divorce us. Once she gets to the district, we won't have a say!" Then, they found Peng Tongtai and Peng Tieliang from their clan and discussed it together. Yuan Xirong incited them, saying, "This daughter-in-law is lawless, she's gone crazy, she even ran up to the stage at the meeting! It's a real disgrace to the Peng family! Can we not beat her? Even if we beat her to death, we can't let her divorce! Even in death, she must be buried in our graveyard!" These words made the Peng family even angrier. Peng Kun then went to consult with Wang Dian, the village peasant representative, about "disciplining" Zhou Biao. Wang Dian was initially hesitant, but Yuan Xirong and Peng Kun repeatedly approached Wang Dian, insisting on giving Zhou Biao a thorough "discipline." Wang Dian finally agreed. The next day (September 8th), Wang Dian convened two so-called "peasant representative meetings," attended by Peng Kun, Peng Yong, Peng Ji, Peng Dong, Peng Tieliang, Peng Sanjiang, Peng Quancheng, Peng Xiu, Peng Tongtai, Peng Liang'an, Peng Suo, Peng Heng, etc., all of whom wanted to beat Zhou Biao. At the meeting, Peng Kun proposed and passed a resolution to "beat Zhou Biao in order to prevent such incidents from happening again in Jukanggou Village in the future." Wang Dian himself did not dare to decide, and Peng Tongtai, Peng Tieliang, Peng Sanjiang, Peng Yong, and others went to consult with Wang Shixin, a member of the township government. Wang Shixin initially disagreed with the beating. But after many people insisted on requesting it, he finally agreed. Wang Dian and Peng Suo were still afraid it was unreliable, so they went to consult again in person, and Wang Shixin agreed. After Wang Dian consulted, he went back and asked everyone, "Who will be responsible after the beating?" Peng Tieliang said, "Our two groups will be responsible." Yuan Xirong said, "You can beat her as you please! If the flesh is damaged, the bones are mine." Peng Kun said, "I'll be responsible for the beating!" After discussing it, all twenty-one people prepared weapons such as white wax sticks and leather ropes and, led by Wang Dian, went to beat Zhou Biao. Wang Dian also borrowed two guns and ordered Peng Ken'an, Wang Gaizhi, and Peng Suo to stand guard at the entrance of Peng Yong's house, saying, "If anyone comes to rescue her, shoot!" Everything was arranged, and the murderers tied Zhou Biao up and subjected her to severe torture. Zhou Biao was beaten until her skin and flesh were bruised and purple, and she was covered in blood, constantly begging for mercy. But the murderers beat her even harder. Peng Kun said, "I must beat you to death to pay for my life!" To make it easier to beat her, they later hung Zhou Biao on the east wall to beat her. When the rope broke, they hung her on the west wall to beat her. Several times she was beaten unconscious, and they revived her with cold water. They beat her until dawn, beating Zhou Biao to death. Wang Shixin, upon learning of this, knew that he was responsible for this case and, fearing being implicated, quickly gathered the militia to arrest the criminals (Peng Xiu fled in fear of punishment) and sent them to the higher-level government.

In order to vigorously promote and implement the Marriage Law, on September 30th, the Yuxian County People's Court, in collaboration with the Yuxian County Democratic Women's Federation, held a women's representative meeting in the Ninth District of Yuxian County to publicly try the murderers in this case. Representatives from the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the CCP, the Xuchang Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate, and the Women's Federations of the special zone, county, and district participated as jurors. The representatives unanimously agreed that the murderers should be severely punished. The Yuxian County People's Court, in accordance with Article 26 of the Marriage Law and the "Order on Implementing the Marriage Law" issued by the Central and South Military and Political Committee, sentenced the principal offenders Yuan Xirong and Peng Kun to death, Wang Dian and Peng Tieliang to life imprisonment, and Peng Yong to twenty years of imprisonment. Wang Shixin was sentenced to two years of imprisonment (suspended for two years). Other criminals were also sentenced to imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes, or released after education. It is now being submitted to higher authorities for approval according to judicial procedures.

    河南禹县菊王沟村彭坤等聚众打死孕妇周彪
    凶犯经人民法院举行公审分别判刑
    河南省禹县九区菊王沟村于九月八日发生二十一人集体打死孕妇周彪案。同月三十日该县人民法院举行公审，将主犯袁绣荣、彭坤判处死刑。其他凶犯也分别判处徒刑。
    被害妇女周彪今年二十岁，禹县三股洞乡人。从小被父母包办与同县九区杏山坡乡菊王沟村彭永（贫农）订婚。去年腊月被强制结婚。周彪未出嫁前，是土地改革中的积极分子，思想很进步。彭永的思想却非常落后。结婚后夫妇感情不合，周彪常受婆母和丈夫的打骂，被管制着不许出门，不许参加任何社会活动。周彪感到十分痛苦，曾几次向菊王沟村村农民代表王殿提出要和彭永离婚。王殿一直没管。今年九月七日，老根据地访问团在三股洞乡开群众大会，周彪偷着跑到会场，想找区干部诉苦并请求离婚。可是又怕被彭家的人看见，惹出祸来。所以坐在台前，不敢上台。大会开到中间下了大雨，结果她的苦没有诉成。这次周彪参加开会被彭家的族人看到了，回去就告诉了她的婆婆袁绣荣、丈夫彭永和丈夫的哥哥彭坤。袁绣荣和两个儿子商量说：“周彪准是要和咱离婚。到了区上，可就没咱们说的话啦！”接着又把本族的彭同太、彭铁梁找来，共同商量。袁绣荣鼓动说：“这媳妇可没天啦，要疯啦，要跑到会场台上去啦！真丢咱彭家的人！这不打还行？打死也不能叫她离婚！死也要埋在咱茔地里！”这一席话，说得彭家的人更有气了。彭坤就去找村农民代表王殿商量要“管教”周彪。王殿最初犹疑不定，袁绣荣、彭坤又三番两次找王殿，一定要痛痛地“管教”周彪一番。王殿最后也同意了。第二天（九月八日），王殿召开了两次所谓“农民代表会”，参加会议的有彭坤、彭永、彭记、彭东、彭铁梁，彭三江、彭全成、彭秀、彭同太、彭良安、彭锁、彭恒等，都是要打周彪的人。会上经彭坤提议，通过了“殴打周彪，以保持菊王沟村今后不再发生这种事件”的决议。王殿自己不敢决定，当场彭同太、彭铁梁、彭三江、彭永等人去请示乡政府委员王世鑫。王世鑫起初不同意打。但在许多人坚持请求下，最后也应允了。王殿和彭锁还怕不可靠，又亲往请示，王世鑫答应了。王殿请示以后，回去问大家：“打了以后谁负责？”彭铁梁说：“咱两组负责。”袁绣荣说：“您请打啦！肉打坏了，骨头是我的。”彭坤说：“打了我负责！”商量好以后，全体二十一人准备了白腊条、皮绳等凶器，在王殿率领下前往殴打周彪。王殿又借枪两枝，命彭恳安、王改芝、彭锁三人在彭永家门口站岗，并说：“有人来救就开枪！”一切都布置好了，凶手们就把周彪绑起来，严刑拷打。周彪被打得皮肉青紫，鲜血淋漓，不断地哀呼饶命。但凶手们却越打越狠。彭坤说：“非打死你给你抵命不可！”为了打起来省力，他们后来把周彪吊在东墙上打。绳子被打断了，又吊在西墙上打。几次打死，都用凉水喷活。一直打到天亮，活活将周彪打死。王世鑫得悉，知道此案自己负有责任，怕受连累，连忙集合民兵把凶犯（彭秀畏罪逃跑）逮捕，送交上级政府。
    为大张旗鼓地宣传并贯彻执行婚姻法，九月三十日，禹县人民法院协同禹县民主妇女联合会在禹县九区召开妇女代表会对该案凶手进行公审。参加陪审的有中共许昌地委纪律检查委员会、河南省人民检察署许昌分署以及专区、县、区妇联等单位的代表。代表们一致认为必须严惩杀人凶犯。禹县人民法院乃根据婚姻法第二十六条及中南军政委员会发布的“贯彻执行婚姻法的命令”，判处该案主犯袁绣荣、彭坤以死刑，王殿、彭铁梁处无期徒刑，彭永处有期徒刑二十年。王世鑫判处徒刑二年（缓期二年）。对其他罪犯也按情节轻重分别判处徒刑，或教育后释放。现正按司法程序呈请上级批准。
