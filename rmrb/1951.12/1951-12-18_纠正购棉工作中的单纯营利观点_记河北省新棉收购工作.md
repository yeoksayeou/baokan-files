    Correcting the Purely Profit-Driven Viewpoint in Cotton Purchasing
    —A Record of New Cotton Purchasing Work in Hebei Province
    Ren Jiaji

    Hebei Province’s new cotton purchasing work is among the best in the North China region. The province overfulfilled its purchasing and transfer tasks for new cotton in September and October. The total amount of ginned cotton purchased exceeded the original plan by 7.99 percent, and the total amount of raw cotton transferred exceeded the plan by 3.97 percent.

    The reason why Hebei Province's cotton purchasing work was able to achieve the above results, in addition to the farmers' high enthusiasm for selling cotton patriotically, the importance attached to cotton purchasing work by the Party committees and people's governments at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party, and the implementation of the method of cooperative societies contracting for cotton purchases, an important reason was the correction of the purely profit-driven viewpoint and departmentalism of some cadres in the cotton purchasing work.

    Some cadres in Hebei Province originally lacked sufficient understanding of the serious political significance of this year's cotton purchasing work, and carried out cotton purchasing work with a purely profit-driven viewpoint. In their work, they were quite lacking in an overall perspective.

    In terms of seed cotton processing: some cooperatives regarded seed cotton processing as a sideline production of their members, planning to increase income for their members through "trickle down" methods, and did not actively organize cotton gins for rapid processing; or, in order to earn more processing profits, they attempted to monopolize the processing; and if they could not gin the seed cotton they collected themselves, they did not well implement the instructions of the higher authorities to transfer the seed cotton externally. As a result, some cooperatives accumulated large quantities of seed cotton, while some small towns' power-driven cotton gins had no cotton to gin. In addition, some county financial departments simply emphasized "power first, then manpower" and "public first, then private." In order to take care of the state-owned power-driven cotton ginning factories, they cancelled the processing contracts for human-powered cotton gins that had already been signed with cooperative members, but the state-owned cotton ginning factories could not complete the processing tasks in a timely manner. This not only hindered the timely transfer of raw cotton, but also accumulated funds, hindering continued cotton purchasing. From September to early October, the funds that could not be turned over due to the accumulation of seed cotton throughout the province amounted to about 300 billion yuan. As a result, many cotton purchasing stations at that time had to "buy cotton for two days and stop weighing it for three days."

    In terms of the supply of materials: some state-owned trading companies in some areas were unwilling to establish a consignment sales relationship with cooperatives in order to avoid bearing business taxes (the tax on goods sold on consignment is paid by the company; if the company sells on credit, the tax is paid by the cooperative). This made it impossible to sign sales contracts for a long time. Some trading companies simply emphasized that the specifications of materials were not suitable for the habits of the masses, or that they were afraid of high freight costs, or that the goods could not be sold if they were transported to the countryside, and did not actively establish material supply organizations or allocate materials to the countryside. For example, the Handan Special District branch of the China Grain Company originally planned to establish 114 supply stations, but only more than 60 had been established by mid-October; of the grain planned to be allocated to the countryside in October, only 2.5 percent was transported. As a result, on the one hand, farmers could not buy grain after selling cotton, and on the other hand, large quantities of grain were piled up in warehouses, and the task of withdrawing currency could not be completed on schedule.

    In terms of implementing the policy of paying higher prices for better cotton: some cooperative societies' graders favored friends and relatives, treating lower-grade cotton as higher-grade cotton. Some cooperative societies were unable to deliver cotton at the original grade and lost money due to the poor technical skills of their graders. After losing money, they deliberately lowered the purchase price to make up for the losses, thereby dampening the enthusiasm of cotton farmers to sell cotton and creating opportunities for some private merchants to rush to purchase. In some areas, this caused a disconnect between cotton prices and market prices, affecting the completion of purchasing tasks.

    After the above-mentioned deviations in cotton purchasing work occurred, the relevant leading departments at all levels in Hebei Province immediately made great efforts to correct them. In early October, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Hebei Provincial People's Government organized an inspection team headed by Dai Jinong, Director of the Provincial Department of Commerce, to go to Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xingtai and other places to assist local leading departments in solving problems in cotton purchasing work. The special districts and counties in key cotton producing areas all convened meetings of cadres for cotton purchasing work in mid-to-late October (county-level meetings were attended by grassroots cooperative cadres and other relevant grassroots cadres). After the meetings, cotton purchasing work groups were organized to go to the countryside to correct the thinking of cadres on the one hand, and to supervise and solve the problems that had already occurred on the other. Through this series of measures, the deviations in cotton purchasing work in Hebei Province were generally corrected. For example, the processing contracts between the Handan Special District Cooperative and the state-owned power-driven cotton ginning factories, which had been unable to be signed for a long time due to disputes over processing profits, were signed in late October under the education and supervision of the Special District Financial and Economic Committee and the Provincial Inspection Team. After the conclusion of the Handan Special District's cotton purchasing work cadre meeting in mid-October, grain, department store and other trading companies in Handan Special District immediately established consignment sales contracts with cooperatives and actively organized transportation forces to transport goods to the countryside. In late October, cooperatives in Linzhang, Wu'an and other counties with more accumulated seed cotton organized 90 percent of the county's human-powered cotton gins and began to allocate seed cotton to power-driven cotton ginning factories in other places for processing. In order to implement the policy of paying higher prices for better cotton, the cotton purchasing stations of the Shulu County Cooperative established cotton grading committees in mid-October. Before starting work each day, the graders met once to check for shortcomings and exchange work experience.

    纠正购棉工作中的单纯营利观点
    ——记河北省新棉收购工作
    任家骥
    河北省新棉收购工作，是华北区各省中做得较好的。全省九、十两月份新棉收购和调运任务都超额完成，计皮棉收购总数超过原订计划百分之七点九九，原棉调运总数超过计划百分之三点九七。
    河北省购棉工作所以能获得以上成绩，除了因为农民爱国售棉热情高涨、中共各级党委和各级人民政府重视购棉工作、实行合作社包收棉花的办法以外，一个重要的原因是纠正了某些干部在购棉工作中的单纯营利观点和本位主义思想。
    河北省某些干部原先对今年购棉工作的严重政治意义认识不足，曾以单纯的营利观点来进行购棉工作，他们在工作中，曾经相当缺乏整体观念。
    在籽棉加工方面：有些合作社把籽棉加工当作社员的一种副业生产，打算用“细水长流”的办法为社员增加收入，不积极组织轧车迅速加工；或者为了多赚加工利润，企图包办加工；自己收的籽棉轧不了，也不很好地执行上级将籽棉外调的指示。因此，某些合作社积压大量籽棉，而有些小城镇的动力轧车却无棉可轧。另外，有的县财经部门单纯强调“先动力后人力”、“先公后私”，为了照顾公营动力轧花厂，取消和合作社社员已订的人力轧车的加工合同，而公营轧花厂又不能及时地完成加工任务。这样不但妨碍原棉及时地调运，而且还积压了资金，妨碍继续购棉。全省九月份到十月上旬因积压籽棉而不能周转的资金有三千亿元左右。因而不少收棉站当时只得“收两天棉花，停三天秤杆”。
    在物资供应方面：有些地区的国营贸易公司为了避免担负营业税，不肯和合作社建立代销关系（代销的货物由公司纳税；公司要赊销，由合作社纳税）。这就使销货合同长期订不起来。有的贸易公司单纯强调物资规格不适合群众习惯，或怕运费大，怕货物运下乡销不掉，而不积极设立物资供应机构，调拨物资下乡。如邯郸专区中国粮食公司分公司原计划设立一百一十四个供应站，到十月中旬只设立了六十多个；十月份计划调拨下乡的粮食，也只运走百分之二点五。结果，一方面农民卖棉后买不到粮食，另一方面大批粮食堆在仓库里，回笼任务不能按期完成。
    在贯彻优棉优价政策方面：有些合作社的分级人员恩赐亲朋，把次级棉当作高级棉收。有的合作社因分级人员技术不好，收的棉花交不上原级，赔钱。赔钱后，就故意降价收购，弥补亏空；因而打击了棉农售棉的热情，并且给部分私商制造了抢购的机会。部分地区曾因此造成棉花牌价和市价脱节的现象，影响收购任务的完成。
    上述购棉工作中的偏向发生后，河北省各级有关领导部门立即大力进行纠正。河北省人民政府财政经济委员会十月上旬组织了以省商业厅厅长戴冀农为首的检查团，分赴石家庄、邯郸、邢台等地，协助当地领导部门解决购棉工作中的问题。重点产棉区的专区、县都在十月中、下旬召开了购棉工作干部会议（县级召开的会议，有基层合作社干部及其他有关基层干部参加），会后又组织了购棉工作组下乡，一面纠正干部思想，一面督促解决已发生的问题。经过这一系列的措施，河北省购棉工作中的偏向，一般地得到了纠正。如邯郸专区合作社和公营动力轧花厂的加工合同，过去因争执加工利润，长期订不起来，这次在专区财政经济委员会和省检查团的教育和督促之下，已于十月下旬订立了。邯郸专区粮食、百货等贸易公司，在十月中旬该专区的购棉工作干部会议结束后，立即和合作社建立了代销合同关系，积极组织运输力量运货下乡。积压籽棉较多的临漳、武安等县合作社，在十月下旬，都把全县百分之九十的人力轧车组织起来，并开始调拨籽棉给外地动力轧花厂加工。束鹿县合作社各收棉站，为了贯彻优棉优价政策，十月中旬都成立起棉花评级委员会，在每天开始工作前，分级人员碰头一次，检查缺点，交流工作经验。
