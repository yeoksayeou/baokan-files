Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: London "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 28th: The real purpose of the US proposal on supervising the armistice is to delay the ceasefire—to prolong the state of war indefinitely, or in their own words: to seek a "lasting armistice." What is now hindering the resolution of this agenda is the US proposal that goes far beyond the scope of the Military Armistice Conference. The essence of the US proposal is to keep the troops in Korea at their current level in a state of war indefinitely. The essence of the Korean-Chinese side's proposal is to eliminate the war as quickly as possible through a ceasefire and military armistice, and then promptly hold a high-level peace conference to resolve the Korean issue. According to the US proposal, anything imported into Korea, any new building, the restoration of a factory, or even the repair of a truck could be interpreted as a build-up of military strength. For North Korea, this would paralyze it. For South Korea, this would be to condone the destruction of the remaining Korean industry and legalize the massive dumping of every kind of American consumer product into Korea. The Korean-Chinese side opposes this "permanent armistice" approach of the US. The Korean-Chinese side's proposal safeguards the interests of the people of North Korea and equally safeguards the interests of the people of South Korea.

The US propagandists, who are now making a big fuss about the inspection issue, are trying to make the public ignore the significant fact that the main issue at present is to decide what to inspect and then decide how to inspect it. One aspect of the US conspiracy at present is to try to mix up the questions of what to inspect and how to inspect, as if they were the same thing. The attitude of the Korean-Chinese side is that the supervisory body should have the power necessary to ensure the implementation of the armistice terms. As for the issue of preventing the build-up of armed forces that the US is now raising in the negotiations, the Korean-Chinese side told them today: "If all foreign troops are withdrawn from Korea, then there will actually be no question of military supplies, equipment, and facilities exceeding the level at the time of the armistice." Nam Il also told them, "In order to quickly reach an agreement on the third agenda item, we believe that your side should not insist on this inappropriate and unworkable proposal." Because, after all, the US plan is actually impractical and will only cause endless entanglements and prevent a peaceful resolution from being achieved here.

    伦敦工人日报记者魏宁顿揭露
    美方无理建议的罪恶目的
    是使战争状态无限期延长
    【新华社三十日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十八日自板门店报道：美方关于监督停战的建议的真正目的，是拖延停火——使战争状态无限期地拖延下去，或者用他们自己的话来说：求得“持久的停战”。现在妨碍这项议程的解决的东西，是美方提出的远远超过军事停战会议范围以外的办法。美方建议的实质，是使在朝鲜的军队在目前水平上无限期地处于战争状态。朝中方面的建议的实质，是以尽快的停火和军事停战的办法消除战争，然后迅速举行高级和平会议，以解决朝鲜问题。根据美方的建议，输入朝鲜的任何东西，任何新建筑物，恢复一个工厂，乃至修理一辆卡车，都可以被解释为集结军事力量。对朝鲜北部来说，这样做将会使它陷于瘫痪状态。对朝鲜南部来说，这样做就是认可破坏残存的朝鲜工业，并使美国的每一种消费品向朝鲜大量倾销合法化。朝中方面反对美方的这种“永久停战”的办法。朝中方面的建议既保障了朝鲜北部人民的利益，也同样保障了朝鲜南部人民的利益。
    现在对视察问题大吹大擂的美方宣传家正试图使公众忽视一个显著的事实，即目前的主要问题是决定视察什么，然后再决定怎样进行视察的问题。而目前美方阴谋的一个方面，是想要把视察什么和怎样进行视察的问题搞在一起，就好像它们是一件事一样。朝中方面的态度是：监督机构应握有保证监督停战条款的实施所必需的权力。至于美方现在在谈判中提出的防止集结武装力量的问题，朝中方面今天告诉他们说：“假如一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退，那么，实际上就没有军事供应品、装备和设施超过停战时的水平的问题了。”南日并告诉他们说：“为了迅速对第三项议程达成协议，我们认为你方不应坚持这种不适当的和行不通的建议。”因为，归根结底说来，美国的计划实际上是无法实行的，只会引起无休止的纠葛，并阻止在这里获得和平解决。
