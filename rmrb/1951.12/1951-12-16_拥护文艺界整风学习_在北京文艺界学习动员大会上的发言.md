    Supporting the Rectification and Study in Literary and Art Circles
    ——Speech at the Mobilization Meeting for Study in Beijing's Literary and Art Circles
    Ouyang Yuqian
    What do we urgently need? It is to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. I think we should sincerely support this rectification and study in literary and art circles and be determined to study it well.

    Study should be carried out for a long time, but because of overemphasizing the long-term nature of ideological remolding, it inevitably becomes somewhat lax. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out a short-term, focused study in a certain stage to conduct an ideological examination and push the study forward more effectively.

    We ourselves are constantly learning, but it can be faster and more effective to combine it with an organized and led collective study. From the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the criticism of Comrade Xiao Yemu's creation until now, although some ideological struggles have been unfolded, there has been no systematic study. The phenomenon of ideological confusion in literary and art circles still exists, and this study has a clarifying effect.

    What I find most difficult in learning is the inability to connect with reality. I deeply feel that you cannot connect with reality by closing the door. I gained a lot from the study of reviewing cadres, and my political understanding has improved a lot. In particular, based on specific examples, I clarified the interaction between struggle and unity—struggle will not only not destroy unity, but can also consolidate unity. Recently, the Central Academy of Drama rehearsed "Eliminate the Invaders" and invited several volunteer soldiers to help us rehearse. Taking this opportunity, I approached them, listened to their conversations, watched their actions, and appreciated their qualities. I felt that they were lovely. Usually, I read Korean dispatches and listened to the reports of volunteer army heroes, and I was very moved. I respected and admired the volunteer soldiers, but only when I actually approached them did I truly love them from the bottom of my heart and clearly feel that they are the most lovable people. If I could be with them on the Korean battlefield, my feelings would definitely be deeper. Therefore, to connect learning with reality, we must clarify our position and participate in the struggle.

    Regarding leading literary and artistic institutions, the fundamental issue is ideological leadership. I am in a leading position. Because my revolutionary practice is not enough and my theoretical foundation is not enough, I cannot help but feel nervous in my work for more than two years. Although my desire to progress is very strong, my pace in pursuing the truth is often slow and difficult to move forward. Because the petty-bourgeois consciousness unconsciously comes out, the judgment of works inevitably has a bias starting from technology and form. The Central Academy of Drama also often pays attention to learning. The shortcoming is that it has not put proletarian ideology in the first place, and has not been able to carry out resolute and ruthless struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology and consciousness. At first, when I saw some things being handled improperly, I did not think it was an ideological problem, but later I realized that the handling of any matter must be based on ideology.

    Some plays or films, I feel wrong after watching them, but I can't say what is wrong, so I haven't carefully studied and repeatedly thought about affirming or denying them. For example, when I watched "The Life of Wu Xun", I was very unhappy at the time, I didn't like the expression of servility and the idea of ​​accepting things lying down. At that time, I decided to write a letter to Comrade Zhou Yang to oppose the screening of the film, but I did not write it; a few days later, when I saw Mr. Sun Yu, I didn't say anything. This is obviously a petty-bourgeois liberal attitude.

    When I came to the Central Academy of Drama, I only knew Comrades Zhang Geng and Cao Yu, but I got along very well with the comrades in the academy and cooperated quite happily, but because of the lack of mutual criticism, there was a feeling of harmony, and the content was empty. The Central Academy of Drama has not produced good works in the past two years, nor has it performed plays of representative value, which is still due to problems in the ideological aspect.

    We must properly reform our ideology, like practicing thrift, "vigorously" reform our ideology, and we must truly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism in our hands. I hope that the Party comrades will lead us seriously. I have learned too little, and I hope to be able to make a more in-depth review in this study.

    拥护文艺界整风学习
    ——在北京文艺界学习动员大会上的发言
    欧阳予倩
    我们迫切的需要是什么？是要学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。我想我们应当诚诚恳恳拥护这次文艺界的整风学习，下决心把它学好。
    学习是应当长期进行的，但因为过于强调思想改造的长期性，就不免或多或少流于疲塌，因此就某一阶段进行一个短期的、有重点的学习，来作一次思想检查，把学习更有效地向前推进一步，我认为是非常必要的。
    我们自己也不断地在学习，可是要和一种有组织有领导的集体学习相配合，方可以更快，收到更大的效果。从“武训传”的批评和对萧也牧同志创作的批评，一直到现在，虽然展开了一些思想斗争，但还没有进行过有系统的学习。而文艺界思想混乱的现象依然存在，这一次的学习，是有澄清作用的。
    我在学习中所最感到困难的是不能联系实际。我深深感到：关起门来联系实际是联系不起来的。在审查干部的学习中我得到不少的东西，政治认识提高不少，尤其是，根据具体的事例，明确了斗争与团结相互的作用——斗争非但不会破坏团结，而且可以巩固团结。最近中央戏剧学院排演“消灭侵略者”，请了几位志愿军的战士来帮我们排练，趁这个机会，我接近了他们，听他们的谈话，看他们的行动，体会到他们的品质，我感觉他们可爱。平常我读朝鲜通讯，听志愿军英雄们的报告，我很感动。对志愿军战士，我尊敬他们，佩服他们，及至实际接近了他们，才从我心眼儿里爱他们，明确地感觉他们是最可爱的人。倘若我能在朝鲜战场上和他们一处，感情必定会更加深厚。所以学习联系实际，必定要明确立场，参加斗争。
    关于领导文艺机构，根本问题是思想领导。我处的是领导地位，自己因为革命的实践不够，理论基础也不够，两年多以来在工作当中，不能不感觉紧张，希望进步的心虽然很切，追随真理的步伐往往迟重难前。由于小资产阶级的意识不自觉地会钻了出来，对作品的判断也就不免存在着从技术、从形式出发的偏向。中央戏剧学院也经常注重学习。缺点是没把无产阶级思想放到第一位，没有能对资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想意识作坚决的、无情的斗争。最初我看见有些事处理得不得法，我并不以为是思想问题，后来才明确处理任何一件事都要以思想为依据。
    有些戏或影片，我看了感觉不对，但是说不出那里不对，也就没有为着要肯定或否定加以细心的研究和反复的思考。例如我看了“武训传”，当时我很不高兴，我不欢喜那种奴颜婢膝的表现和逆来顺受的思想。当时我决定写信给周扬同志反对那个片子的上映，可是我没有写；过几天见着孙瑜先生，我也没有说什么。这显然是小资产阶级的自由主义态度。
    我到中央戏剧学院，只认识张庚同志和曹禺同志两个人，可是我和学院内的同志们相处得都很好，合作得相当愉快，但因互相缺乏批评，颇有一团和气，内容空虚之感。中央戏剧学院两年来没有产生出好的作品，也没有演出有代表价值的戏，也还是由于思想方面存在着问题。
    我们必须好好地改造思想，像厉行节约那样，“厉行”思想改造，我们要把批评与自我批评的武器真正掌握在我们手里。希望党的同志认真领导我们。我学得太少，希望能在这次的学习中能作比较深入的检讨。（原载文艺报第五卷第四期）
