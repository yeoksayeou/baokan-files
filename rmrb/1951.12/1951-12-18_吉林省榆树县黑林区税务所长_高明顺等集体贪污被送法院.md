    Gao Mingshun, Director of the Tax Office in Heilin District, Yushu County, Jilin Province, and Others Sent to Court for Collective Embezzlement

    Gao Mingshun, Director of the Tax Office in Heilin District, Yushu County, Jilin Province, and others have been sent to court for punishment for collectively embezzling tax money.

    Beginning in August 1950, Gao Mingshun and Wang Qihua began colluding with backward cadres Wang Dianzhen and Huang Guoqi in the Heilin District trading market, using methods such as underestimating taxes and fines during tax collection, extortion, or not issuing tax receipts to systematically embezzle funds. Gao Mingshun sent Wang Dianzhen to collect taxes from an oil mill in Sandao Village, Heilin District. On three occasions, he embezzled more than 1.9 million yuan by not issuing tax receipts. In November 1950, Wang Qihua "sealed" a sugar workshop and said he would impose a fine of 1.1 million yuan, and then Wang Dianzhen feigned intercession and "fined" them 150,000 yuan, which they also embezzled. Using these methods to embezzle, by April 1951, they had embezzled more than 10.06 million yuan in eight months, while also causing the state to lose 30 million yuan in tax revenue.

    Gao Mingshun and the other three have been submitted to the court for punishment by the People's Procuratorate of Yushu County, Jilin Province, and this case has been notified to the tax authorities and other business departments.　People's Procuratorate of Yushu County, Jilin Province

    高明顺等四人已经被吉林省榆树县人民检察署提交法院惩办，并且把这个案件通报税务机关和其他企业部门。　吉林省榆树县人民检察署
