To the Editor: The Kaifeng City private Zhenda Tobacco Factory, driven by greed for exorbitant profits, engaged in speculation and trickery by adulterating raw materials with red soil and miscellaneous tobacco stems, leading to sluggish sales and factory shutdown. During the labor-capital consultation to dismiss workers, Du Jiawu, the manager of Zhenda Tobacco Factory, used methods such as wining and dining to buy off grassroots union cadres like Wang Fengying. At that time, he and Wang Fengying and others agreed that Wang and others would receive the dismissal compensation stipulated in the contract, while other workers would only receive 60% of the stipulated amount. After the agreement, Du Jiawu convened a labor-capital consultation meeting, where Wang Fengying took the lead in advocating that 60% of the contractually stipulated amount be paid to the workers as dismissal compensation. The workers, unaware of the inside story, agreed to this proposal and formally signed a labor-capital agreement with the capitalists. However, the workers eventually discovered the deception by the capitalists and Wang Fengying and others. Everyone reported the matter to the Kaifeng City Labor Bureau, which, after investigation, jointly handled the matter with relevant units such as the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. Currently, Du Jiawu and Wang Fengying and others have been punished. Based on the factory's situation, the dismissal compensation is now being paid by the capitalists at 70% of the contractually stipulated amount.

    开封市私营振大烟厂资方
    收买工会干部欺骗工人受到应得处分
    编辑同志：开封市私营振大烟厂贪图暴利，投机取巧，在原料中掺入红土和杂烟梗，产品因而滞销，工厂被迫停工。在劳资协商解雇工人的过程中，振大烟厂经理杜甲午用请客喝酒等手段，收买工会基层干部王凤英等。当时，他和王凤英等议定：王等得到按合同规定数的解雇金，其他工人只给规定数的百分之六十。商定后，杜甲午就召开劳资协商会议，在会议上，王凤英带头主张合同规定数的百分之六十，发给工人解雇金。工人因为不知内幕，也同意这个建议，正式和资方签订了劳资协议书。但是，资方和王凤英等欺骗工人的事情，终被工人们发觉。大家把这件事告诉了开封市劳动局，劳动局调查后，就会同市工商局、市工商联等有关单位，共同处理这件事。现在，杜甲午和王凤英等已受到处分。解雇金根据厂内情况，按合同规定数的百分之七十由资方照发。
