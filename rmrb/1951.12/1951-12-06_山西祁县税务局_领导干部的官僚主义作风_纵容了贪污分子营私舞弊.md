    Shanxi Qixian County Tax Bureau
    Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres
    Connivance with Embezzlers in Engaging in Malpractice
    Editor: Zhao Shan, the director of the Chengguan Tax Office of the Qixian County Tax Bureau in Shanxi Province, and Wu Youcheng, the deputy director, and others have become ideologically degenerate, using their positions to embezzle more than 2.3 million yuan of public funds. They have now been sent to the Qixian County Judicial Section for legal punishment.

    From January to May of this year, Zhao Shan, Wu Youcheng, and others used their positions to repeatedly forge the names of tax evaders who were found, privately carve seals, and fraudulently collect bonuses on four occasions. At the same time, Zhao and Wu, disregarding the government's reputation, even stole the bonuses obtained from the masses for reporting tax evasion for their own personal gain. The main reason for the above embezzlement is the serious bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Qixian County Tax Bureau. They do not pay attention to publicizing policies to the masses, but rely solely on punishment. For example, Hao Faming, a small stall merchant (selling peanuts, cigarettes, fruits, etc.) in Dongjie, Qixian County, was fined 552,000 yuan for evading stamp tax. This fine accounts for 46 percent of all his funds. However, some merchants could reduce their taxes by inviting people from the tax bureau to dinner. These phenomena have caused dissatisfaction among the masses, but the leadership of the bureau turned a blind eye. They neither conducted in-depth inspections of the work nor trusted the masses. Some comrades had previously reported to the tax bureau that Wu Youcheng and others had committed embezzlement and corruption, but Wu denied it and threatened the leading cadres and whistleblowers with suicide. The leading cadres of the tax bureau, fearing that something might happen, adopted a conciliatory attitude without principle, which actually supported the embezzlers. This is a manifestation of a serious bureaucratic work style.

    山西祁县税务局
    领导干部的官僚主义作风
    纵容了贪污分子营私舞弊
    编辑同志：山西省祁县税务局城关税务所所长赵山、副所长吴有成等思想堕落，利用职权贪污公款共二百三十多万元。现已被送往祁县司法科依法惩办。
    赵山、吴有成等在今年一月至五月间，曾利用职权连续四次假造查获漏税人名，私刻图章，骗领奖金。同时赵、吴等不顾政府信誉，竟将群众告密漏税所得奖金窃为私有。造成以上贪污的主要原因是祁县税务局领导干部官僚主义作风严重所致。他们不注意向群众宣传政策，却单凭惩罚办事。如祁县东街小摊商人郝发明（卖花生、纸烟、水果等），因为漏了印花税，就被罚了五十五万二千元。这项罚款占他所有资金的百分之四十六。但有的商人因请税务局的人吃了饭，就可减轻税收。这些现象曾经引起群众的不满，但该局领导方面却熟视无睹。他们既不深入检查工作，又不相信群众。有些同志以前曾向税务局报告吴有成等有贪污腐化事实，但吴不承认，反以自杀来威胁领导干部和告发者。税务局领导干部因怕出事，就无原则地采取了和事态度，这实际上是给贪污分子撑了腰，这是一种严重的官僚主义作风的表现。    胡兰生  杨润生
