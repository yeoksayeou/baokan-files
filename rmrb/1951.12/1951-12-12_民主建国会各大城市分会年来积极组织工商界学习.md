Following the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the China Democratic National Construction Association is summarizing its 1951 propaganda and education work experience in order to assist the industrial and commercial circles in launching a broad ideological remolding movement.

In the past year, the China Democratic National Construction Association organized members and the general industrial and commercial circles to study current political affairs in order to carry out the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, which was warmly welcomed by the industrial and commercial circles. The study of the industrial and commercial circles generally took the form of lectures, seminars, current affairs study sessions, and summer training courses, in addition to regular group studies. Some branches have recently jointly organized cadre training classes or night schools with other parties or independently, to conduct systematic political and ideological education for their members.

The work of the China Democratic National Construction Association in organizing the industrial and commercial circles to study has achieved many results. The Chongqing branch sent many members to serve as instructors in the study groups of the Federation of Industry and Commerce during the organization of current affairs studies in the industrial and commercial circles. As a result of the efforts of these instructors, seventeen study groups were quickly consolidated and developed into one hundred and thirteen groups. As a result, the industrial and commercial circles in Chongqing quickly recognized the reactionary and erroneous nature of pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American ideas, and enhanced their national self-esteem and self-confidence. The Chongqing branch also held eleven seminars during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement. Many industrialists and businessmen who had always had the idea of "protecting themselves by being wise" became enlightened after participating in the seminars. They were able to quickly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and bravely expose the counter-revolutionary elements in their industries. For example, Zhou, who worked in the Chinese medicinal materials industry, accused Zhou Maozhi, a special agent who had controlled the industry for more than 20 years; Shi Xiaokuan, who worked in the dried vegetable industry, accused Tan Shaobin, a local tyrant in the industry. They dared to raise these issues only after being inspired at the seminar and breaking through their ideological concerns.

The Beijing branch has held "New Knowledge Seminars" (actually lecture meetings) since September 3, 1949, and has held 132 sessions to date. More than 70% of the listeners are industrialists and businessmen, with a cumulative total of 27,479 people. Many of those who regularly attended the "New Knowledge Seminars" later joined the China Democratic National Construction Association and played a leading role in various patriotic movements. For example, Zhao Yitang, who works in the grain industry, is already 60 years old. After studying, he understood the policies of the People's Government, greatly increased his enthusiasm for management, and developed unlimited love for the new China.

The "New Century Symposium" (also actually a lecture meeting) held by the Tianjin branch was hosted by Li Zhuchen, Zi Yaohua, and others, with more than 1,000 people attending each time. It also played a role in improving the thinking of the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles.

The "New Era Study Group" and the "Industrial and Commercial Study Group" held by the Shanghai branch also helped members and the industrial and commercial circles to study. In order to promote the work of donating airplanes and cannons and improve public-private relations, they convened two industrial and commercial symposiums and one symposium on improving public-private relations, enabling the industrial and commercial circles to have a correct understanding of public-private relations. Liu Nianyi (member of the China Democratic National Construction Association) of the match industry vividly introduced at the meeting the situation of the smooth development of the match industry after accepting the leadership of the state-owned economy, and many industrialists and businessmen therefore abandoned their wrong ideas about the issue of public-private relations.

After continuous study, the members and industrialists and businessmen of the Wuhan branch have generally improved their political awareness.

Li Yushu, a member of the Jinan branch, and her sister, have become unprecedentedly enthusiastic about patriotism after participating in the China Democratic National Construction Association and conducting studies. In the peace signature movement, they mobilized 1,543 people to participate in the signature and voting movement.

    民主建国会各大城市分会
    年来积极组织工商界学习
    在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议后，民主建国会为帮助工商界展开广泛的思想改造运动，正在总结一九五一年的宣传教育工作经验。
    民主建国会在过去一年中，为开展抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，曾组织了会员及一般工商界的时事政治学习，获得了工商界的热烈欢迎。工商界的学习，除经常的小组学习外，一般地采取了演讲会、座谈会、时事学习会及夏令讲习会等方式。有些分会最近还联合其他党派或单独举办了干部训练班或夜校，对会员进行有系统的政治思想教育。
    民主建国会组织工商界学习的工作，已经获得许多成绩。重庆分会在组织工商界时事学习中，曾派很多会员担任工商联合会各学习小组的辅导员。经过这些辅导员努力的结果，十七个学习小组很快就巩固起来，并且发展到一百一十三个小组。重庆的工商界便因此在很短时间内认识了亲美、崇美、恐美思想的反动性和错误性，提高了民族自尊心和自信心。重庆分会在镇压反革命运动中还举行了十一次座谈会，许多向来就有“明哲保身”思想的工商业者，在参加座谈以后搞通了思想，便能够迅速分清敌我，勇敢地检举自己同业中的反革命分子。例如中药材业周某控诉了把持该业二十多年的特务周懋植；干菜业石效宽控诉了该业中的恶霸谭绍彬等，都是在座谈会中得到了启发，打破了思想顾虑才敢提出的。
    北京分会从一九四九年九月三日起，举办了“新知识座谈会”（实际上是演讲会），到现在止已举办了一百三十二次。听讲的百分之七十以上是工商业者，累计已达二万七千四百七十九人。经常到“新知识座谈会”听讲的人后来有许多参加了民主建国会，在各种爱国运动中起了带头作用。如粮食业的赵宜堂，已经六十岁了，经过学习，了解了人民政府的政策，经营的积极性大大提高，对新中国发生了无限的热爱。
    天津分会举办的“新世纪座谈会”（实际上也是演讲会），由李烛尘、资耀华等主持，每次听讲的人都在一千人以上。对天津工商界思想的提高也发生了作用。
    上海分会举办的“新时代学习会”和“工商学习会”，对会员及工商界的学习也有帮助。为推动捐献飞机大炮工作和改善公私关系，他们召集了工商座谈会两次，改善公私关系座谈会一次，使工商界对公私关系有了正确的认识。火柴业的刘念义（民主建国会会员）在会议上生动地介绍了火柴业接受国营经济领导而得到顺利发展的情形，许多工商业者因而放弃了对公私关系问题的错误想法。
    武汉分会的会员和工商业者经过不断的学习，政治觉悟都普遍提高了。
    济南分会会员李玉淑姊妹两人，在参加民主建国会和进行学习后，爱国热情空前提高。在和平签名运动中，她俩发动了一千五百四十三人参加签名及投票运动。
