Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 13th to discuss the proposal by Arab states to include their complaint against France for violating the principles of the UN Charter and the principles of the Declaration of Human Rights in Morocco on the agenda. At the meeting, colonial countries headed by the United States, Britain, and France, like in the General Affairs Committee, continued to stubbornly demand that the General Assembly postpone the discussion of this proposal, but this attempt was sharply criticized by representatives of many countries. In the long discussion, many representatives of Arab countries, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Abyssinia, as well as the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries spoke successively, severely condemning France's and other colonial countries' national oppression policies, making the colonial countries feel extremely embarrassed. They once instructed Bolivia to move for adjournment, but it was rejected by a majority. Finally, although the colonial countries gathered twenty-eight votes and barely passed a resolution to "postpone" consideration of this proposal, twenty-three delegations voted against it, and seven delegations abstained. This situation clearly indicates a significant trend in the current international situation, namely: the position of US, British, and French imperialism in the United Nations is becoming increasingly isolated, and the majority voting machine they control is becoming increasingly disobedient.

According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 15th: When the UN General Assembly plenary session began discussing this issue on the 13th, the audience at the venue was extremely crowded. The Iraqi representative was the first to speak. He pointed out: The Moroccan people fought against fascism in the last World War and suffered considerable losses; the Moroccan people hoped that they would gain freedom and independence after the war. However, the Moroccan people still have no rights.

The Iraqi representative emphasized: If France had complied with the principles of the UN Charter, Morocco would have become an independent country long ago. But that is not the case. The Iraqi delegation firmly demanded that the United Nations discuss the Arab countries' complaint.

In his speech, the Syrian representative mentioned the statement made by French Foreign Minister Schuman on November 13. Schuman's words meant that he had no reason to feel ashamed of the work France had done in Morocco to educate the people. The Syrian representative asked: If that is the case, why is France so stubbornly unwilling to let the world know the current situation in Morocco? Why doesn't France agree to discuss this issue in this General Assembly? It is said that Morocco enjoys the grace of freedom, but it makes me ashamed when I know that the French authorities in Morocco have forbidden the publication of articles written by Schuman himself. The Syrian representative continued: Schuman once told us that it is impossible to forcibly implement democracy. However, we are not complaining that France is forcibly implementing democracy in Morocco; of course, even forcibly implementing democracy is better than maintaining the current regime. I even find it embarrassing to give the current regime a truly appropriate name. We ask the General Assembly to come out and defend the Moroccan people.

Pakistan's representative, Foreign Minister Zafarullah Khan, said: The General Affairs Committee has no right to recommend to the General Assembly to "postpone" the discussion of this issue, because the General Affairs Committee only has the right to recommend whether to include a certain issue on the agenda or not. He also said: Obviously, someone has ulterior motives and does not want a decision to be reached on this issue. Zafarullah Khan emphasized that the Moroccan people have every right to demand autonomy and independence. He said: France has said that it has successfully completed its mission in Morocco. If France wants to prove that its words are correct, then it must admit that the Moroccan people have every right to demand autonomy and independence. In conclusion, Zafarullah Khan suggested changing the title of this motion. He said: Since the French delegation stated that it was an insult to say that France violated the principles of the UN Charter and the principles of the Declaration of Human Rights, this motion could be included on the agenda with the title "The Question of the Independence and Sovereignty of Morocco." Zafarullah Khan said that if France and other delegations still disagree with including this motion on the agenda, it means that those who talk louder than others about freedom are actually against freedom.

Egypt's representative, Foreign Minister Salah al-Din, said: If the General Assembly does not agree to include the Morocco issue on the agenda, it will cause small countries to lose confidence in the United Nations and further damage the organization's prestige. Salah al-Din emphasized: The French authorities in Morocco are not working for the benefit of the Moroccan people but for the benefit of certain powerful groups in France. The French colonists entrenched in Morocco fear any reform proposals that would deprive them of their privileged status.

The Iranian representative said: The recommendation of the General Affairs Committee should be rejected; the Morocco issue should be included on the agenda.

The Polish representative said: All the facts indicate the extremely serious and appalling situation within Morocco. The French authorities' response to the legitimate demands of the Moroccan people is the brutal suppression of the national movement. France's attempt to delay the discussion of the Morocco issue exposes its intention to cover up the actual situation within Morocco.

The Indonesian representative also demanded that the recommendation of the General Affairs Committee be rejected, and emphasized that hundreds of millions of people have expressed their solidarity with the Moroccan people.

The representatives of India, Ecuador, Yemen, and Lebanon also demanded that the Morocco issue be included on the General Assembly's agenda. The Abyssinian representative said: There is no provision in the UN Charter that prohibits the General Assembly from discussing this issue.

Next to speak was the Soviet representative, Yarujian, who said: The complaint against France's policy towards Morocco is a serious matter. If the United Nations does not want to continue to lose its credibility as an international organization, then the General Assembly cannot and should not ignore this complaint. He said: The Soviet delegation supports the proposal of Egypt and other Arab countries to include the Morocco issue on the General Assembly's agenda.

The Afghan representative also supported the proposal of Egypt and other Arab countries in his speech.

The US representative defended France's colonial policy in Morocco in his speech. He said: Discussing the Morocco issue would hinder France from finding a solution to this issue outside the United Nations.

The Czechoslovak representative spoke in support of the Arab countries' proposal. He said: Western countries are establishing military bases on the territory of Morocco, which is the main reason why colonial countries are trying to prevent the discussion of the Morocco issue. But that is also why the Morocco issue must be discussed at this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Some representatives revealed the reign of terror by the French authorities in Morocco in their speeches. Judging from the facts they listed, the claim by the head of the French delegation, Schuman, to depict the situation in Morocco as a scene of peace and prosperity is despicable and unconvincing. None of the facts cited by Schuman could refute the speeches of the vast majority of representatives in this meeting's debate. In order to appease the anger towards France's colonial policy in Morocco and to alleviate the resentment demanding that this issue be submitted to this General Assembly for discussion, Schuman vaguely promised to implement some reforms in the future "to enable Morocco to achieve autonomy."

The Iraqi representative responded to Schuman by saying: Arab countries do not want Morocco to implement reforms or establish an autonomous government. What they want is for Morocco to become a free and independent country. He said: The French representative did not even dare to mention the word "independence," but we hope that he is talking about Morocco becoming an independent country.

The Egyptian representative also spoke out against Schuman, saying: The French delegation did not even express its attitude towards changing the title of the proposal, because the title contained the two words "independence."

The representatives of the colonial countries were a little afraid because they saw that this discussion was unfavorable to them, so they sent the Bolivian representative to the podium. The Bolivian representative moved for adjournment so that the colonial countries would have time to exert pressure on some delegations that favored including the Morocco issue on the agenda.

But the colonial countries' trick failed. Twenty-eight delegations voted against Bolivia's proposal. Seven delegations abstained, and only twenty-two delegations voted in favor.

Next, Pakistan's representative Zafarullah Khan delivered a long speech. He said: We have heard a lot about the representatives of Western countries talking endlessly about freedom here. But when it comes to the independence and freedom of a certain nation, they usually abandon their previous words. But Eastern European countries support us, we must remember this and be very grateful for this support. Zafarullah Khan pointed out: The representatives of the United States and France demanded that the Morocco issue not be discussed, insisting that this would further aggravate the current tension. He said: We have also heard for the first time that if the situation is tense, it is best not to discuss it.

After the French representative Schuman made a second speech, the colonial countries again tried to obstruct the discussion of this important issue.

The Uruguayan representative, on the orders of the colonial countries, suggested that no vote be held at this meeting, but that the discussion be postponed to the next meeting. This suggestion was obviously inconsistent with the decision on the General Assembly to continue the discussion, so the chairman immediately rejected the suggestion.

Then, a roll-call vote was taken on the recommendation of the General Affairs Committee. The recommendation requested the General Assembly to temporarily not discuss the issue of including the complaint of Egypt and other Arab countries on the General Assembly's agenda.

The delegations of twenty-three countries, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Burma, Ecuador, Egypt, Abyssinia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Mexico, and Yugoslavia, voted against the recommendation of the General Affairs Committee, and in favor of including the Morocco issue on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. Seven delegations abstained. Due to the votes of the colonial countries, some countries in Latin America, and Western European countries (a total of twenty-eight votes), the General Assembly was forced to accept the illegal recommendation of the General Affairs Committee.

The Egyptian representative said at the end of the meeting: Because the resolution passed only stipulates that the Morocco issue will not be discussed temporarily, the Egyptian delegation believes that it has the right to raise this issue again at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, and will raise this issue at an appropriate time.

    联大全体会议讨论把阿拉伯国家控诉案列入议程问题
    许多国家代表斥美英法殖民政策
    美英法帝国主义处境十分孤立狼狈不堪
    【新华社十九日讯】联合国大会于十三日举行全体会议，讨论阿拉伯国家要求把它们控诉法国在摩洛哥违反联合国宪章原则和人权宣言原则的提案列入议程的问题。会上，以美、英、法为首的殖民国家，像在总务委员会内一样，继续硬要大会延缓讨论这个提案，但是这种企图遭到了许多国家代表的尖锐抨击。在漫长的讨论中，各阿拉伯国家、印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、阿比西尼亚、以及苏联和各人民民主国家的许多代表连续发言，严辞斥责法国和各殖民国家的民族压迫政策，使各殖民国家大感狼狈。它们曾一度指使玻利维亚动议休会，然而竟被多数否决。最后，虽然殖民国家纠集了二十八票，勉强使大会通过了“延缓”考虑这个提案的决议，但是投反对票的达二十三个代表团，另有七个代表团弃权。这种情况清楚地指明了目前国际形势中一个有意义的趋势，即：美、英、法帝国主义在联合国中的处境也愈来愈孤立，它们所控制的多数表决机器已越来越不听指挥了。
    据塔斯社巴黎十五日电报道：在联合国大会全体会议十三日开始讨论这个问题时，会场听众极为拥挤。伊拉克代表第一个发言。他指出：摩洛哥人民在上次世界大战中和法西斯主义作战，受到相当重大的损失；摩洛哥人民希望在战争结束后他们将能获得自由和独立。但是，摩洛哥人民现在仍然没有权利。
    伊拉克代表强调说：如果法国遵守联合国宪章的原则，摩洛哥早就成为独立的国家了。但事情并不是这样。伊拉克代表团坚决要求联合国讨论阿拉伯国家的控诉案。
    叙利亚代表在发言中提到法国外交部长舒曼在十一月十三日所发表的声明，舒曼的话大意说，他没有理由对法国在摩洛哥所作的教化民众的工作感到羞愧。叙利亚代表问道：既然如此，法国为什么这样固执地不让世界知道摩洛哥目前的情形呢？法国为什么不同意在这里的大会上讨论这个问题呢？据说，摩洛哥享有自由的恩泽，但是在我看来，当我知道了摩洛哥的法国当局禁止发表舒曼本人所写的文章的时候，我不禁替它羞愧。叙利亚代表接着说：舒曼曾告诉我们，勉强实行民主是不可能的。但是，我们并不是抱怨法国在摩洛哥勉强实行民主，固然即使是勉强实行民主也还是比维持现政权好一点，要给这个现政权起一个真正合适的名字，是连我都觉得难为情的。我们要求大会出来为摩洛哥人民辩护。
    巴基斯坦代表、外交部长查弗鲁拉·汗说：总务委员会没有权利向大会建议“延缓”关于这个问题的讨论，因为总务委员会只有权建议把某一问题列入议程，或者不列入议程。他又说：显然，有人心怀鬼胎，不希望在这个问题上得出决定。查弗鲁拉·汗强调指出：摩洛哥人民完全有权要求自主与独立。他说：法国曾经说过，它已成功地完成了它在摩洛哥的任务，如果法国希望证明它的话是正确的，那么它就必须承认摩洛哥人民完全有权要求自主和独立。查弗鲁拉·汗在结语中建议改变这一议案的题目。他说：既然法国代表团表示：说法国违反联合国宪章原则和人权宣言原则是对它的侮辱，这个议案就可以用“摩洛哥的独立与主权问题”这样的题目列入议程。查弗鲁拉·汗说，如果法国与其他国家代表团还是不同意将这个议案列入议程，这就意味着那些谈论自由的声音比别人响亮的人实际上是反对自由的。
    埃及代表、外交大臣赛拉哈丁说：如果大会不同意把摩洛哥问题列入议程，这就会使小国对联合国丧失信心，并进而损害这个组织的威信。赛拉哈丁强调说：摩洛哥的法国当局并不是为摩洛哥人民的利益而是为法国某些有势力的集团的利益工作的。盘据在摩洛哥的法国殖民者害怕那种会剥夺他们特权地位的任何改革的主张。
    伊朗代表说：总务委员会的建议应该予以否决；摩洛哥的问题应该列入议程。
    波兰代表说：一切事实都说明了摩洛哥境内极端严重和骇人听闻的情况。法国当局对于摩洛哥人民的合法要求的回答，就是残酷地镇压民族运动。法国企图拖延讨论摩洛哥问题的举动，暴露了它打算掩盖摩洛哥境内实际情况的意图。
    印度尼西亚代表也要求否决总务委员会的建议，并且着重指出：数亿人民已表示他们对摩洛哥人民的声援。
    印度、厄瓜多尔、也门和黎巴嫩的代表也要求把摩洛哥问题列入大会议程。阿比西尼亚代表说：联合国宪章上没有那一条规定不准大会讨论这个问题。
    接着发言的是苏联代表亚鲁疆，他说：控诉法国对摩洛哥政策是一件严重的事。如果联合国不愿继续使自己丧失作为国际机构的威信，那末大会就不能而且也不应该对这件控诉置之不理。他说：苏联代表团支持埃及和其他阿拉伯国家把摩洛哥问题列入大会议程的建议。
    阿富汗代表在发言中也支持埃及和其他阿拉伯国家的建议。
    美国代表在发言中为法国在摩洛哥的殖民政策辩护。他说：讨论摩洛哥问题会妨碍法国寻找在联合国以外解决这个问题的办法。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表发言支持阿拉伯国家的建议。他说：西方国家正在摩洛哥的领土上建立军事基地，这就是殖民国家为什么设法阻止讨论摩洛哥问题的主要原因。但是也就是因为这样，摩洛哥问题必须在本届联合国大会上加以讨论。
    一些代表发言时揭露了摩洛哥法国当局的恐怖统治，从他们列举的事实来看，法国代表团团长舒曼想把摩洛哥情势描写成一片升平气象的说法是可鄙的，是不能令人信服的。舒曼举出的事实里面，没有一件能够驳倒这次会议的辩论中绝大多数代表的发言。为了要平息对于摩洛哥的法国殖民政策的愤怒，为了要缓和要求把这个问题交由本届大会讨论的愤愤不平的情绪，舒曼含糊其词地答应在将来实行一些改革，“使摩洛哥得以自治”。
    伊拉克代表回答舒曼说：阿拉伯国家并不是要摩洛哥实行改革或建立自治政府。他们要求的是摩洛哥成为自由和独立的国家。他说：法国代表甚至不敢提起“独立”这个字眼，而我们希望他讲的是摩洛哥将成为独立国家。
    埃及代表也发言驳斥舒曼说：法国代表团甚至对于改变提案的题目都没有表示态度。因为这个题目里有“独立”两个字。
    殖民国家的代表看到这次讨论对他们不利，心里有些害怕了，因此就派玻利维亚代表上讲台。玻利维亚代表动议休会，以使殖民国家有时间来对一些赞成把摩洛哥问题列入议程的代表团施压力。
    但是殖民国家的这个诡计失败了。二十八个代表团投票反对玻利维亚的建议。七个代表团弃权，只有二十二个代表团投赞成票。
    接着，巴基斯坦代表查弗鲁拉·汗发表了长篇演说。他说：西方国家的代表在这里滔滔不绝地谈论自由，我们已经听得很多了。但是一谈到某个民族的独立和自由时，他们照例就背弃前言了。而东欧国家却是支持我们的，我们必须记住这些，并且非常感激这种支持。查弗鲁拉·汗指出：美国和法国的代表要求不要讨论摩洛哥问题，硬说这样会使目前的紧张局势更加恶化。他说：我们还第一次听到说，如果局势紧张的话，最好是不要讨论它。
    在法国代表舒曼作了第二次发言之后，殖民国家又试图阻挠讨论这个重要问题。
    乌拉圭代表奉殖民国家的命令，建议在这次会议上不举行表决，而延期到下次会议上再继续讨论。这个建议显然和关于大会继续讨论的决定相矛盾，因此，主席立即拒绝了这个建议。
    于是，对总务委员会的建议进行唱名表决。该建议要求大会暂不讨论把埃及和其他阿拉伯国家的控诉案列入大会议程的问题。
    苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门、阿富汗、缅甸、厄瓜多尔、埃及、阿比西尼亚、危地马拉、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、墨西哥和南斯拉夫等二十三个国家的代表团投票反对总务委员会的建议，赞成把摩洛哥问题列入本届大会的议程中。七个代表团弃权。由于殖民国家、拉丁美洲的一些国家和西欧国家的投票（总共是二十八票），大会被迫接受了总务委员会的非法建议。
    埃及代表在会议结束时说：因为所通过的决议只规定暂不讨论摩洛哥问题，埃及代表团认为它有权在联合国大会本届会议上再把这个问题提出来，并且将在适当时间内提出这个问题。
