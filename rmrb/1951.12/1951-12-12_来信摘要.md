Summary of Letters to the Editor

    Shao Yiqiu, American Bishop of the Catholic Church in Xuzhou, and others
    Interference with Patriotic Actions of Catholics Arouses Anger from All Circles
    Shi Peiqing, a Catholic in Xuzhou, is the Director of the Xuzhou Patriotic Catholic Study Committee. Shao Yiqiu (American nationality), the Bishop of the Catholic Church in Xuzhou and an imperialist element, and his lackeys Xu Zongli and Jiang Jin'ao (Chinese nationality) hate our country's patriotic Catholics and have stopped the "divine work" of Shi Peiqing, Ding Pu, Cai Junhua and others. When Shi Peiqing and others questioned Shao Yiqiu, Shao Yiqiu actually said such absurd words: "This is a matter of your conscience, go back and think about it!" Jiang Jin'ao also shamelessly asked Shi Peiqing and others: "What is the purpose of your organizing the Study Committee?" People from all walks of life in Xuzhou are very angry about this matter and have launched a movement to support Shi Peiqing and others. Kong Xiaoqiu

    Chaling, Hunan Should Correct the Trend of Extravagant Eating and Drinking in Rural Areas
    The phenomenon of extravagant eating, drinking and waste among rural cadres and peasants in Chaling County, Hunan Province is very common. For example, Zhang Sigou, a farmer from Youlong Township in the First District, held fifteen or sixteen tables of banquets for his wedding; Tan Zhenbao from Huishan Township also held fifteen or sixteen tables of banquets for his mother's birthday; Chen Goucun from Minzhu Street in the county town held more than twenty tables of banquets for "recruiting a son-in-law"; Peng Guzhu, the chairman of Zuolong Township, held eighteen or nineteen tables of banquets for his wedding, and each guest gave gifts of at least eight thousand or ten thousand. They spent a total of seventy or eighty dan of grain on such extravagance. We suggest that the relevant leading organs quickly correct this phenomenon. Tan Yunzai

    来信摘要
    徐州市天主教美籍主教邵轶欧等
    干涉教徒爱国行动激起各界愤怒
    徐州市天主教徒史培清，是徐州市爱国教友学习委员会的主任委员。徐州市天主教主教、帝国主义分子邵轶欧（美国籍）和他的走狗徐宗礼、姜金鳌
    （中国籍）仇视我国爱国教徒，竟停止了史培清、丁璞和蔡俊华等人的“神功”。当史培清等质问邵轶欧时，邵轶欧竟说出了这样荒谬的话：“这是你们的良心问题，回去好好想想吧！”姜金鳌也无耻地问史培清等：“你们组织学习委员会的目的是什么？”徐州市各界同胞对这事非常愤怒，已展开了声援史培清等的运动。孔晓九
    湖南茶陵应纠正农村中大吃大喝
        风气
    湖南省茶陵县农村干部和农民大吃大喝、铺张浪费的现象非常普遍。如第一区右垅乡农民张四苟结婚，请吃了十五、六桌酒席；辉山乡谭珍保为母亲做寿，也请吃了十五、六桌酒席；县城里民主街陈苟存“招女婿”，请吃了二十多桌酒席；又左垅乡乡主席彭古珠结婚，请吃了十八、九桌酒席，每一客人起码送礼八千或一万。他们这样铺张，所花费的谷子总在七、八十担。我们建议有关领导机关迅速纠正这种现象。谭运仔
