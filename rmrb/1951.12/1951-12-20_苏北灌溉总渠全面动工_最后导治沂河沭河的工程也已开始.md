    Full-Scale Construction Begins on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal
    Final Project to Divert the Yi and Shu Rivers Also Underway

    The Subei Irrigation Main Canal project, a key component of the second year of the Huai River Harnessing effort in the lower reaches, began full-scale construction at the beginning of this month. Along a line stretching from Hongze Lake in the west to the coast of the Yellow Sea in the east, 500,000 laborers have begun intensive work. Nearly 10,000 farming households living within the canal zone are being relocated with the help of the People's Government, in the spirit of "one family's trouble for the peace of ten thousand families."

    The Subei Irrigation Main Canal is one of the major projects in the second year of Huai River harnessing. The canal is designed to start from Gaoliangjian on the east bank of Hongze Lake, and run eastward across the Grand Canal, passing through Huaiyin, Huaian, Funing, Binhai and other counties, until it reaches Biandang Port on the Yellow Sea coast, a total length of 170 kilometers. This canal will divert 700 cubic meters per second of the Huai River's flow, irrigating 2.5 million mu of farmland in Subei, reducing the Huai River's flow into the Yangtze River to 7,000 cubic meters per second. The entire project is large in scale, including the excavation of a 170-kilometer-long canal, the construction of an intake sluice gate and a control sluice gate on the Grand Canal, and a coastal tide barrier gate at the entrance to the sea, involving more than 70 million cubic meters of earthwork. It is expected to be completed in 1953. In 1952, 45 million cubic meters of earthwork will be completed, and the construction of the intake sluice gate and control sluice gate will begin.

    The Subei area was originally a fertile land of fish and rice. Since the Yellow River seized the Huai River's course, whenever the Huai River floods and the Grand Canal's water level rises, the area east of the Grand Canal relies entirely on the dykes on the east bank of the Grand Canal for protection. Before liberation, the Grand Canal dykes often breached, so the people of Subei often suffered from floods. In dry years, the Grand Canal lacked water, and the small rivers east of the Grand Canal (collectively known as the Lixia River) also lacked water, and the vast farmland in Subei could not be irrigated. The vast cotton reclamation area along the coast of Subei has also been unable to develop due to lack of irrigation water. After the completion of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, the flood threat in the area east of the Grand Canal will be eliminated, and agricultural production in the Lixia River basin and the coastal areas of Subei will be greatly developed.

    Xinhua News Agency:

    The final projects to divert the Yi River and Shu River in Shandong Province and the Subei area began in early and mid-November respectively. More than 190,000 laborers in Shandong Province have participated in the diversion project.

    The Yi River and Shu River diversion project began in 1949. The diversion project this winter and spring in Shandong primarily focuses on opening a diversion canal to divert the Yi River's water into the old Shu River, blocking the Chenghekou northeast of Pixian County, continuing the excavation of the new Shu River diversion canal and the Linhong River dyke construction project, and simultaneously completing the construction of the dam and spillway near Daguanzhuang in Linshu County on the Shu River. In Subei, the main tasks are to demolish the temporary Zaohe cofferdam on the Grand Canal, construct the Zaohe control gate, ship lock, and the spillway at the southern end of Luoma Lake, and continue to complete the Zhangshan Qieling project, excavate the new Yi River project, and dredge the drainage channels on both sides of the new Yi River. The two provinces and regions plan to complete a total of more than 18 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 900,000 cubic meters of stonework.

    The entire project will be completed before the flood season next year, with the aim of ensuring that when the Yi River discharges 6,000 cubic meters per second of floodwater and the Shu River discharges 4,500 cubic meters per second of floodwater during next year's flood season, there will be no further dangers, freeing more than 10 million mu of farmland in southern Shandong and northern Subei, which have suffered from floods for many years, from the threat of flooding.

### 苏北灌溉总渠全面动工  最后导治沂河沭河的工程也已开始

    苏北灌溉总渠全面动工
    最后导治沂河沭河的工程也已开始淮河下游的苏北灌溉总渠工程，已在本月初全面动工。在西起洪泽湖畔东到黄海海岸的一条线上，已有五十万民工开始了紧张的劳动。居住在渠道线内的近万户农民，本着“一家麻烦万家安”的精神，现在正在人民政府的帮助下迁移。
    苏北灌溉总渠是第二年度治淮中的主要工程之一。渠道设计是从洪泽湖东岸的高良涧起，向东穿过运河，经淮阴、淮安、阜宁、滨海等县，直到黄海边的扁担港，全长一百七十公里。这条渠道，将可分泄淮河的七百秒公方流量，灌溉苏北的二千五百万亩农田，使淮河入长江的流量减为七千秒公方。全部工程的规模很大，包括开挖一百七十公里长的渠道，修进水闸和运河上的节制闸，入海的地方还要修个滨海挡潮闸，土方达七千多万公方，预计一九五三年完成。一九五二年可完成四千五百万公方土工，开始修建进水闸和节制闸。
    苏北区原为丰饶的鱼米之乡，自黄河夺淮后，每当淮河洪水泛滥，运河水位上涨，运河以东地区全赖运河东岸的堤防保护。解放以前运河堤常常溃决，因此苏北人民常遭水灾。干旱的年月，运河缺水，运河以东的小河（通称里下河）便也缺水，苏北广大农田就得不到灌溉。苏北沿海的广大棉垦区，也始终因缺水灌溉得不到发展。苏北灌溉总渠完成后，运河以东地区的水患消灭，里下河流域和苏北沿海地区的农业生产将有极大的发展。    （新华社）
    山东省和苏北区导治沂河、沭河的最后工程，已在十一月上旬和中旬先后动工。山东省参加导治工程的民工已有十九万多人。
    导治沂河、沭河的工程是一九四九年开始的。今冬明春的导治工程，在山东方面主要是开辟分泄沂河水量入旧沭河的引河，堵塞邳县东北的城河口，继续进行新沭河的引河开挖工程和临洪河筑堤工程，并同时完成修筑沭河在临沭县大官庄附近的拦河大坝和溢洪道工程。在苏北方面主要是拆除运河上临时性的皂河束水坝，建筑皂河节制闸、船闸和骆马湖南端的泄水闸，并继续完成嶂山切岭工程、开挖新沂河工程和疏浚新沂河两岸的排水道。两省区计划共要完成土方一千八百多万公方和石方九十多万公方。
    此项工程的全部工程，将在明年汛期以前完成，以期在明年汛期内，沂河宣泄六千秒公方洪水和沭河宣泄四千五百秒公方洪水时不再出险，使山东南部和苏北北部常年遭受水灾的一千多万亩农田免除水患。    　（新华社）
