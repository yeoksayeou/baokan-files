Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 24th. Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, sent a reply to Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, on the 24th. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Commander-in-Chief Ridgway of the United Nations Forces:

We have received your letter of December 21.

For the sake of the interests of prisoners of war on both sides and their families, we believe that the most important thing at present is to quickly resolve the various issues in the negotiations so as to reach a ceasefire agreement as soon as possible. This will allow all captured personnel held in prisoner-of-war camps on both sides to return to their hometowns quickly after the agreement is signed and goes into effect, reunite with their long-separated and anxious relatives, and resume their peaceful lives. Several important issues in the current ceasefire negotiations are close to resolution, but the ceasefire agreement has not yet been reached because your side has repeatedly insisted on unreasonable demands to delay the negotiations, and the prisoners of war on both sides cannot be released, thus prolonging the pain of long-term expectations of thousands of families of captured personnel on both sides.

Our side, in the spirit and policy of leniency towards prisoners of war, has given them completely humane treatment in terms of food, clothing, shelter, and entertainment. Wounded and sick prisoners of war are able to receive effective treatment from the medical facilities and medical personnel arranged for them. The accurate list of prisoners of war provided by our side fully reflects our humane attention and concern for prisoners of war. Therefore, we believe that a visit by the International Committee of the Red Cross to the prisoner-of-war camps is unnecessary.

However, in order to facilitate the repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides, we suggest that immediately after the ceasefire agreement is signed and goes into effect, representatives of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of China, together with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, form a joint visiting group, set off in groups, conduct on-site visits to prisoner-of-war camps on both sides, and prepare to assist in the repatriation work at the centralized locations for the transfer of prisoners of war on both sides. If you agree, please forward this suggestion to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung

Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai

December 24, 1951

Ridgway's Letter

To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army

General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

Since the early days of the Korean conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross has repeatedly requested you and your government authorities to allow their representatives to enter North Korea solely to inspect prisoner-of-war camps in order to provide material and spiritual assistance to the United Nations prisoners of war and the Republic of Korea prisoners of war you are now holding. In addition, the United Nations Command Armistice Delegation has repeatedly proposed to your delegation that the same permission be granted, and pointed out that the United Nations Command has allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross to have this privilege for prisoners of war in its possession since the beginning of this war. To date, all these requests and suggestions have been rejected. Now, on behalf of the tens of thousands of soldiers concerned and on behalf of the family of every person captured by you, I personally ask you to reconsider this action. I see no justifiable reason why you should not allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to carry out this basic humanitarian work - work that all countries have certainly allowed the Committee to carry out in previous wars. With only the welfare of these people and the grief of their families in mind, I sincerely ask you to immediately permit properly credentialed representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to enter the country - they are now ready to assist you at any time.

Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, General of the Army, U.S. Army Ridgway
I suggest that after the ceasefire agreement comes into effect, representatives of the Red Cross Societies of Korea and China, together with representatives of the International Red Cross Committee, visit the prisoner of war camps and help with repatriation.

    美方一再节外生枝坚持无理要求拖延谈判
    金日成彭德怀两将军答复李奇微
    我建议停战协定生效后，由朝中红十字会代表，会同红十字国际委员会代表，分赴双方战俘营进行访问，并协助遣俘工作。【新华社开城二十四日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，二十四日以复函一件送交联合国军总司令李奇微。该函全文如下：联合国军李奇微总司令：
    我们收到了你十二月二十一日的来信。
    为了双方战俘和他们家属的利益，我们认为，当前最重要的事情，是迅速解决谈判中的各项问题，使之早日达成停战协议，以便使停留在双方战俘营中的全部被俘人员，得以在协定签字生效后，迅速回到他们的家乡去，和他们久别而悬念的亲人们团聚，恢复他们的和平生活。现在停战谈判中的几个重要问题，业已接近解决，只是因为你方一再节外生枝地坚持无理的要求来拖延谈判，以致停战协议尚未达成，双方战俘无从获释，双方万千被俘人员家属的长期悬望的痛苦也因此继续下去。
    我方对于战俘，无论是在饮食、被服、居所或娱乐方面，都本着宽待战俘的精神和政策，给予他们以完全合乎人道的待遇。伤、病战俘都能够从为他们安排的医疗设备和医务人员那里得到有效的治疗。我方所提出的关于战俘的精确名单，充分反映了我方对于战俘的人道的注意和关切。因此，我们认为红十字国际委员会对战俘营的访问是不必要的。
    但是，为了双方遣俘工作进行便利起见，我们建议，在停战协定签字生效之后，立即由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的红十字会的代表，会同红十字国际委员会的代表组成联合访问团，分组出发，到双方战俘营去进行就地访问，并准备在双方战俘交接的集中地点，协助遣俘工作。你如同意，请将我们这个建议转达给红十字国际委员会。朝鲜人民军最高司令官    金日成中国人民志愿军司令员    彭德怀
        一九五一年十二月二十四日李奇微的来信朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军：从朝鲜冲突的早期以来，红十字国际委员会曾几次请求你们以及你们的政府当局许可他们的代表进入北朝鲜，单单去视察战俘营，以便给你们现在羁留的联合国军战俘和大韩民国战俘以物质上和精神上的援助。此外，联合国军停战代表团已一再向你方代表团提出建议，要求给予同样的许可，并且指出，联合国军司令部从这场战争一开始时起就允许红十字国际委员会对它所拥有的战俘有这种特权。迄今为止，这一切请求和建议都被拒绝。现在我代表有关的成千上万的士兵并以被你们俘掳的每一个人的家庭的名义，我再亲自请求你们重新考虑这种行动。我丝毫看不出你们有任何正当的理由不允许红十字国际委员会执行这种基本的人道主义的工作——在以前的战争中各国都肯定允许该委员会进行的工作。我一心只想到这些人的福利和他们的家庭的哀痛，我诚恳要求你们，请求立即许可持有适当证件的红十字国际委员会代表入境——他们现在已准备好随时给你们以援助。联合国军总司令、美国陆军上将    李奇微
