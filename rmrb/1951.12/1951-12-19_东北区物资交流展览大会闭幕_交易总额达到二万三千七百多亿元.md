    Northeast Region Materials Exchange Exhibition Concludes
    Total Transaction Volume Reaches 23,700 Billion Yuan
    The Northeast Region Materials Exchange Exhibition concluded on the 15th. During the three-month exhibition period, there were more than 650,000 visitors, and the total transaction volume reached 23,777.6 billion yuan.
    Among the visitors to the conference were 216 delegations from various parts of Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall) and the Northeast region itself, including more than 1,000 agricultural labor models from various parts of the Northeast region. The conference, in conjunction with relevant departments, organized symposiums for agricultural labor models and invited them to visit textile, agricultural tool, and pesticide factories. After seeing the enormous productivity of the working class, the agricultural labor models deeply realized the great significance of the working-class leadership and the worker-peasant alliance. The broad masses of visitors, especially workers and peasants, recognized that improving production technology is the necessary way to improve production efficiency after visiting the exhibition. Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from Korea saw the rapid progress of the motherland's construction in the conference and were determined to better defend the motherland. Among the visitors to the conference were also international friends from the Soviet Union, Hungary, North Korea, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and other countries. After visiting, they unanimously praised the glorious achievements of the Chinese people in economic construction. The transaction activities of the conference promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in the Northeast region, further restored the commercial relations between the Northeast and Guannei, which had been interrupted for many years, and established new commercial relations led by the state-owned economy between the Northeast and the major administrative regions of Guannei.
