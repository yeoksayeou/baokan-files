    Interference with Sister's Freedom of Marriage: Tai Yongnian
    Receives Party "Removal from Position" Punishment
    To the Editor: The People's Daily published an article on October 23rd entitled "The Story of Tai Xiuying and Sun Tianjun's Free Marriage." In this article, Tai Yongnian (Communist Party Village Branch Secretary), who interfered with his sister's freedom of marriage, although having already been sanctioned by national law, has not received any disciplinary action from the Party. I feel this is incorrect. I hope the local higher Party organization will give Tai Yongnian appropriate punishment.
    Wen Yiyou
    To the Editor: Your letter has been received. The reply to Comrade Wen Yiyou's question is as follows: After the incident of Tai Yongnian interfering with his sister Tai Xiuying's freedom of marriage, in order to uphold Party discipline and educate both Tai Yongnian himself and all Party members, we gave Tai Yongnian the punishment of "removal from position" within the Party on June 15th of this year.

    干涉妹妹婚姻自由的邰永年
    受到党内“撤销工作”的处分
    编辑同志：十月二十三日人民日报刊登了“邰秀英孙田均自由结婚的故事”一文。在这篇文章中，干涉妹妹婚姻自由的邰永年（中共村支部书记），虽然已受到国家法律的制裁，但却没有受到党纪的处分。我觉得这是不对的。希望当地上级党组织给邰永年以适当处分。
