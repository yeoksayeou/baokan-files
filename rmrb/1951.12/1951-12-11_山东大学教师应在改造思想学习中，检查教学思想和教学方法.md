    Shandong University Teachers Should Examine Teaching Ideology and Teaching Methods in Thought Reform Studies

    Comrade Editor: The teachers of Shandong University have also launched a thought reform study movement. All of us students are very concerned about this movement, because we deeply realize that only when teachers establish correct teaching attitudes and improve unreasonable teaching methods can our learning be guaranteed.

    Since liberation, through the study of the Social Development History and the Trade Union Law, the teachers of Shandong University have indeed made some progress. Many teachers have changed their old teaching attitudes. They serve the people's education cause with a sense of ownership, incorporate patriotism into their courses, and can often humbly listen to students' opinions on teaching work. Therefore, they have won the love of the students. This is certainly a good phenomenon. However, some other teachers still have serious erroneous ideas. They refuse to improve teaching content and teaching methods. When students raised opinions to a certain professor, his reply was: "I have been teaching for more than twenty years, and it has always been like this." "I have been teaching for twenty-six years, and students have never criticized me. Now, after liberation, someone actually raises opinions about my teaching work. This is truly against the laws of nature and against scholarship..." This kind of self-imposed closure and unwillingness to improve teaching attitude should be resolutely opposed.

    Because some teachers do not have a clear understanding of today's teaching tasks and are unwilling to comprehensively improve teaching work, students suffer losses in their studies as a result. Our Mechanical Engineering Department still learns a set of "American specifications," always talking about "American standard" screws when discussing screws, and discussing American steel when discussing steel. As for the performance of domestic steel, we don't know anything about it. In fact, domestic factories not only do not use American steel, but now have almost completely switched to metric screws. Can this kind of learning be said to be detached from reality?

    Therefore, I hope that teachers can boldly carry out thought reform studies, overcome incorrect ideas, and carefully examine their teaching ideology and teaching methods, so as to better serve the higher education cause of New China and cultivate more construction talents.　Wang Zhengmin

### 山东大学教师应在改造思想学习中，检查教学思想和教学方法

    山东大学教师应在改造思想学习中，检查教学思想和教学方法
    编辑同志：山东大学的教师也开展了改造思想的学习运动。我们全校同学都非常关心这一运动。因为我们深深地体会到只有教师们树立了正确的教学态度，改善了不合理的教学方法，才能使我们的学习得到保证。
    解放后通过社会发展史和工会法等的学习，山东大学的教师们确实有了某些进步。有不少的教师已改变了旧的教学态度。他们用主人翁的态度为人民教育事业服务，在课程中贯穿爱国主义思想，并能经常虚心地听取同学们对教学工作的意见。因此他们都得到了同学们的爱戴。这当然是很好的现象。不过，另外一部分教师还有严重的错误思想。他们拒绝改善教学内容和教学方法。当同学们向某教授提出意见时，他的回答是：“我已经教了二十多年书，一向就如此。”“我教了二十六年书，同学从来没有批评过我，而解放后居然有人对我的教学工作提出意见来了，这真是反规律，反学术……”这种故步自封、不求进步的教学态度是应该坚决反对的。
    因为一部分教师对今天的教学任务没有明确的认识，不愿意全面地改进教学工作，结果使同学们在学习上受到损失。我们机械系到现在还学一套“美国的规格”，讲螺丝总是离不了“美国标准”的螺丝，讲钢铁时也是讲美国的钢铁，至于国产钢铁的性能怎样就不得而知了。事实上国内各工厂不但不用美国钢铁，而且现在差不多已全改用公制单位的螺丝了。这样的学习能说不脱离实际吗？
    因此，我希望教师们能大胆地进行思想改造的学习，克服不正确的思想，认真检查自己的教学思想和教学方法，以便更好地为新中国的高等教育事业服务，培养更多的建设人材。　王拯民
