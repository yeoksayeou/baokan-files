    "1951 Weaving Method" Training Class Concludes
    Graduates to Return to Various Locations to Promote the Method
    Qingdao "1951 Weaving Method" Training Class Begins
    The "1951 Weaving Method" training class, organized by the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, concluded on December 1st after ten days. The training class cultivated the first group of promoters of the advanced weaving method. A total of eighty-four outstanding weaving workers and experienced technicians from twelve regions, including Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Northeast, Central South, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern China, participated in the training. They are about to return to their respective regions to promote the "1951 Weaving Method."
    After ten days of study, all the trainees have basically mastered the "1951 Weaving Method." The trainees in the ordinary loom group have increased their watch from the original three or four looms to eight, with the highest reaching ten or twelve. Wang Lingdi, a female worker at the Qingfeng Yarn Factory in Wuxi, increased her watch from four looms to eight and achieved an outstanding record of 100% proactive shuttle changes. The average watch capacity of the trainees in the automatic loom group also increased from 17.77 looms to 24.1 looms, with many trainees able to watch 32 looms. Geng Chunmei and Guo Jinling, workers at the Tianjin Private Hengyuan Textile Factory, originally watched eight looms each, but now they can both watch 32 looms. Although the number of looms watched by the trainees has increased significantly, they have not produced any substandard cloth during their practice because they have mastered the segmented shuttle change and patrol patterns in the weaving method. Moreover, the intensity of labor has not increased; on the contrary, it is easier than before.
    The teaching of the training class implemented the principle of combining theory and practice, adopting methods such as lectures, worker-teacher demonstrations, internships, mutual observation, and group discussions. Worker trainees focused on hands-on practice, supplemented by lectures and group discussions, while technical personnel trainees focused on the opposite. The teaching promoted a system of guaranteed learning and teaching. Teachers were assigned to each group, with each teacher responsible for teaching two or three students. This strengthened the teachers' sense of responsibility and the students' enthusiasm. Rong Linyang, a technician at the Jin Hua Textile Factory in Shanxi, had not been on the loom for eight years. To be able to promote the new working method after returning to the factory, he also got on the loom and studied with the workers in this training. Now he can watch eight ordinary looms.

    The 1951 Weaving Method training class jointly organized by the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China has started on the first. The training class is headed by Ding Wen, the director of the Production Department of the Municipal Textile Workers' Union, with four engineers and technicians, including Yang Guangxu, as professors. Worker representatives such as Li Xianglan, who had attended the National Weaving Method Conference in Tianjin to demonstrate and learn the working method, are also serving as instructors. More than seventy outstanding workers and technicians from various state-owned cotton textile factories with automatic looms are participating in the training. The first phase of the training class is expected to conclude in one week, and a second phase will be held afterward.

    “一九五一织布工作法”训练班结束
    毕业学员即将返回各地进行推广工作
    青岛“一九五一织布工作法”训练班开课
    中国纺织工会全国委员会开办的“一九五一织布工作法”训练班，历时十天，已在十二月一日结束。训练班培养了第一批先进织布工作法的推广者。参加学习的有上海、青岛、天津、东北、中南、苏北、华北等十二个地区的优秀织布工人和富有经验的技术人员共八十四人。他们即将返回各地进行“一九五一织布工作法”的推广工作。
    经过十天学习，全体学员已基本上学会了“一九五一织布工作法”。普通布机组的学员已由原来看三、四台提高到八台，最高可看十台、十二台。无锡庆丰纱厂女工王玲弟的看台能力由四台提高到八台，并创造了主动换梭达百分之百的优越成绩。自动布机组的学员们，平均看台能力也由十七点七七台提高到二十四点一台，其中很多学员已能看三十二台。天津私营恒源纺织厂工人耿春梅、郭金玲原来看八台，现在都能看三十二台。学员们所看机台虽然增加很多，但由于他们掌握了织布工作法中的分段换梭和巡回规律，在实习中并没有出过次布，而且劳动强度也没有增加，反而比前轻松。
    训练班的教学，贯彻了理论与实际相结合的方针，采用了讲课、工人教师表演、实习、互相观摩、小组讨论等方法。工人学员以上车实习为主，讲课、小组讨论为辅；技术人员学员和这相反。教学中推行了包学包教制。教师分工到各小组去，每个教师负责教两三个学生。这就加强了教师的责任感和学员的积极性。山西晋华纺织厂的技术人员戎林扬已经八年不上车了，为了能够回厂后推行新工作法，这次学习中也上车和工人一道学习。现在他已经能看八台普通布机了。（新华社）
    华东纺织管理局青岛分局和中国纺织工会青岛市委员会共同举办的一九五一织布工作法训练班已在
    一日开课。训练班由市纺织工会生产部长丁文任主任，由杨光煦等四位工程师、技师任教授，并有曾去天津参加全国织布工作法会议表演和学习工作法的工人代表李湘兰等做教员。参加学习的有各国营棉纺织厂自动织布机的优秀工人和技术人员共七十余人。训练班第一期预计一周时间就可结束，以后再举办第二期。    （新华社）
