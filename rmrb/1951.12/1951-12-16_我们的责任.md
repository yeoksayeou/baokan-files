Our Responsibility
　　Tian Jian

　　A reporter who had been to the Korean battlefield, when he bid farewell to our volunteer soldiers, the heroic volunteer army told him:
　　"Reporter comrade, please prepare to report our new victories to the peace-loving people of the world."
　　The reporter comrade replied:
　　"We must also prepare another thing—a triumphal arch."
　　The heroic volunteer army said:
　　"Then, goodbye, motherland!"
　　Motherland, this is what the soldiers often say. In battle, they often think that they represent the motherland; they also often think of Chairman Mao and their own oaths.
　　In the era of Mao Zedong, the profound patriotism and internationalism of our motherland's people are growing day by day. It can be said that every undertaking, big or small, in the motherland is permeated with the ideas of patriotism and internationalism.
　　Some of our literary and art workers have also begun to enthusiastically sing about this new reality. "The Battle Hymn of the Chinese People's Volunteers" is one example. Comrade Wei Wei's "Who Are the Most Lovable People" is also one example. I don't want to say much about it here.

　　What I want to say is that among us, there are still quite a few people who lack the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. They are not enthusiastic about writing about heroes or writing about the bright side, or they write about it incorrectly, smearing black ash on the faces of heroes. However, when they describe a tree or a flower, they describe it so cleanly that they don't allow it to have a trace of dust. What is the reason for this? This is what Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:
　　"Deep in their souls, there is still a petty-bourgeois kingdom."
　　Some people even say this:
　　"The works I write are the most realistic. I am a petty bourgeois, and the heroic characters I write about naturally have petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings. If you are a petty bourgeois and write about proletarian thoughts and feelings, that is false."
　　This is a wrong statement. It is so wrong that it wants to stick to the petty-bourgeois kingdom. In their writing, they do not hesitate to sacrifice heroic figures and damage the image of heroic figures. Can the people of the motherland allow him to do this? Absolutely not!
　　Some people also say: "I am doing this for the sake of the twists and turns of the story, for the sake of artistry."
　　Is the twists and turns of the story more important than the political nature of the work? What is a story without correct political content? The person he wants to write about is clearly a patriot, but in his writing, he is given a backward label, and then a formulaic process of transformation is inserted, saying that he has changed from being indifferent to political tendencies to actively participating in political activities. -- This is called "for the sake of the twists and turns of the story." In this way, some people have turned the heroes of our motherland into clowns. Among us, there are indeed many such people who talk all day long about twists and turns, grandeur, greatness, beauty, etc., but they forget the worker-peasant-soldier masses, forget the people, forget our responsibilities, and also forget that the so-called artistry and political nature are completely inseparable. As a literary and art worker, without a high degree of political enthusiasm for serving the people, without rich practical experience in life, nothing good will be produced.
　　Therefore, I feel that we have a major responsibility. We must profoundly study patriotism and internationalism, and we must become ardent patriots. We should understand the meaning of "motherland" as profoundly as the volunteer soldiers, and understand the meaning of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea." We have a responsibility to sing the praises of the volunteer army, and we must implement the opinions of the volunteer army: report their victories. The great sons and daughters of Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Volunteers, when they first went abroad last year, with the sky on their heads and the snow under their feet, fought thousands of miles, braving death, showing lofty heroism. They said: "Every step we take forward, the victory of world peace takes a step forward." They are advancing day and night. After a year, a month, can't we take a step forward? They do not hesitate to shed their own blood, don't we still want to get rid of our own shortcomings?
　　We must become ardent patriots, which requires us to practice Chairman Mao's call to us: transform our thinking. The reason why our literary and art work has erroneous tendencies is not only due to being divorced from politics and life, but also because some people even lack basic political common sense. They see themselves as greater than the people, they do not go deep into the masses, do not go deep into the struggle, and therefore cannot truly understand the motherland, the people, and literature and art. The tendency to be indifferent to politics is serious in the literary and art circles, and some creations have violated the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. In the third volume and fourth issue of Northeast Literature and Art, there is a novel called "Chinese Guest," which completely distorts our volunteer army, distorts the Korean people, and also distorts the relationship between the Chinese and Korean people. Our volunteer army is eager for us to report their victories, but this author has not only failed to fulfill this glorious responsibility, but has instead damaged them. This is worthy of our vigilance.
　　I still remember myself, when I first went to Korea, as soon as I crossed the Yalu River, I felt very uneasy. I am also a literary and art worker, what gift am I bringing to meet the volunteer army? This uneasiness in my heart still exists now. Literary and art workers, we must transform ourselves well, we must study the spirit of patriotism and internationalism well, we must be patriots, we must sing the praises of heroes, sing the praises of the volunteer army!

    我们的责任
    田　间
    有一位记者，到过朝鲜战场，当他和我们志愿军战士告别时，英雄的志愿军对他说：
    “记者同志，请你准备好，向全世界爱好和平的人民报道我们新的胜利。”
    这位记者同志回答说：
    “我们还要准备另外一件东西——凯旋门。”
    英雄的志愿军说：
    “那末，祖国再见吧！”
    祖国，这是战士们常说的话。他们在战斗中，常常想到他们是代表祖国的；他们也常常想到毛主席，想到他们自己的誓言。
    在毛泽东的时代，我们祖国人民深厚的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，与日俱增。祖国的任何大小事业，可以说，没有一件不是贯串着爱国主义、国际主义的思想。
    我们文艺工作者，有的人也已经开始热情地歌唱这新的现实。“中国人民志愿军战歌”，是一个例子。魏巍同志的“谁是最可爱的人”，也是一个例子。这里我不想多说它。
    我想说的，在我们之中，也还有不少的人，他们还缺乏爱国主义和国际主义的精神。他们对写英雄、写光明，并不热情，或者是错误地写出来，在英雄的脸上抹上黑灰。可是，当他们描写一棵树、一朵花时，描写的是那样地干净，不让它有一丝灰尘。这是什么道理呢？这就是毛泽东同志所指出的：
    “他们的灵魂深处还是一个小资产阶级的王国。”
    有的人竟然这么说：
    “我写的作品是最现实主义的。我是小资产阶级，写出的英雄人物，当然带有小资产阶级的思想感情。你要是小资产阶级，写出无产阶级的思想感情，那才是假的。”
    这是错误的说法。错误到想要坚守小资产阶级的王国。在他们的笔下，不惜牺牲英雄人物，不惜损害英雄人物的形象。祖国的人民能够允许他这样做吗？决不会允许的！
    也有的人这么说：“我这是为了故事的曲折性，为了文艺性。”
    故事的曲折性比作品中的政治性还重要吗？没有正确的政治内容的故事，这算得是什么故事？他要写的人物，明明是一个爱国者，但在他的笔下，却被戴上一个落后的帽子，中间又公式地插上一个转变的过程，说他由不问政治倾向转变到积极参加政治活动。——这就叫“为了故事的曲折性”。这样一来，有的人就把我们祖国的英雄写成了丑角。在我们之中，确实还有许多这样的人，成天空谈什么曲折性、气魄、伟大、美妙等等，就是忘记了工农兵群众，忘记了人民，忘记了我们的责任，也忘记了所谓文艺性和政治性是完全分不开的。作为一个文艺工作者，没有高度的为人民服务的政治热情，没有丰富的生活实践，决不会产生什么好的技巧。    所以，我觉得我们有一份重大的责任。我们必须深刻地学习爱国主义、国际主义，我们必须成为一个热烈的爱国主义者。我们应该像志愿军战士那样深刻认识“祖国”的意义，认识“抗美援朝”的意义。我们有责任歌颂志愿军，我们要执行志愿军的意见：报道他们的胜利。毛泽东的伟大儿女们，中国人民志愿军，去年刚出国时，头上顶着天，脚下踏着雪，千里征战，出生入死，显示了崇高的英雄气概。他们说：“我们每前进一步，世界和平的胜利就前进一步。”他们日日夜夜在前进着。难道我们经过一年，一个月，还不能前进一步么？他们不惜把自己的鲜血洒出来，难道我们还不想把自己的缺点丢掉么？
    我们要成为一个热烈的爱国主义者，这就必须实践毛主席对我们的号召：改造我们的思想。我们的文艺工作之所以发生错误的倾向，不仅是由于脱离政治、脱离生活，同时也由于有的人甚至缺乏起码的政治常识。他们把自己看得比人民还伟大，他们不深入群众，不深入斗争，因而也就不能真正了解祖国、人民和文艺。不问政治的倾向，在文艺界中是严重的，已经有一些创作是违反了爱国主义国际主义精神的。东北文艺三卷四期上，有一篇名叫“中国客人”的小说，就完全歪曲了我们的志愿军，歪曲了朝鲜人民，也歪曲了中朝人民的关系。我们的志愿军，热望我们报道他们的胜利，这位作者不但没有尽到这光荣的责任，反而损害了他们。这是值得我们警惕的。
    我还记得我自己，刚到朝鲜去时，刚一过鸭绿江，心中就很不安。我也是一个文艺工作者，我带着什么献礼去和志愿军相见呢？这种心上的不安，直到现在，还是有的。文艺工作者们，我们一定要好好地改造自己，要好好地学习爱国主义国际主义的精神，我们一定要做爱国主义者，一定要歌颂英雄，歌颂志愿军！    一九五一年十二月
