The Chen Shengming group of seven people from the fine spinning machine maintenance and oiling group of the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, learned the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method in the patriotic shock increase production movement and created the round-robin cross-oiling method. The time they spent oiling a machine has been reduced from 45 minutes to 20 minutes, creating a new national record. The downtime they save each day by oiling ten machines allows them to spin 87 more pounds of yarn, which is equivalent to an annual increase of 65.25 pieces of yarn. If this work method is promoted throughout the factory, it will allow the factory to produce 228.12 more pieces of yarn per year, which is equivalent to increasing the nation's wealth by over 210 million yuan. If it is promoted in all public and private cotton mills in Shanghai, it can increase yarn production by 5,000 pieces per year.

The characteristics of the round-robin cross-oiling method are: (1) Regular and route-based round-robin crossing, which makes the work of the workers connect with each other, without wasting time and without unnecessary trips. (2) Precise scientific division of labor, which makes each person's work specialized and improves work proficiency. (3) The original individual labor of several people, which was mutually unrelated, has become collective labor like one person. (4) Because the oiling time is shortened, the maintenance and oiling workers can have sufficient time to carry out inspection work after oiling, extending the life of the machine.

The original oiling method of the Chen Shengming group, like other factories in Shanghai, was the segmented work method. That is, the circumference of a fine spinning machine is divided into several segments, and each person is responsible for a segment. From the frame to the foot, all parts are oiled by one person; each time a part is oiled, a tool must be taken, and many unnecessary trips are made; the people who work faster have to wait for the people who work slower, wasting a lot of time. After they implemented the round-robin crossing method, in addition to one person specializing in oiling the head of the machine, the remaining six people each took on several tasks. Before oiling, each person puts the tools they need in a fixed place, and they can take them easily when they need them, without making unnecessary trips. When oiling, the six people circulate sequentially in one direction. The first person does the first task, and the other people behind do the second and third tasks. For example, the first person specializes in pulling out the spindles, the second person specializes in adding spindle oil, and the third person specializes in putting the spindles back in place. When lifting the rollers (fine spinning machine parts), they perform a cross-operation, with four people divided into two groups working on both sides of the machine. When one group of workers walks to the other side to lift the rollers, they can also do other work at the same time, without making unnecessary trips. In this way, six people carry out work in an organized and regular manner throughout the entire oiling process, without wasting any time or energy, thus greatly improving oiling efficiency.

The round-robin cross-oiling method of the Chen Shengming group was created on the basis of the democratic unity movement. Through this movement, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers in the factory has been greatly improved, and the spirit of mutual assistance and unity has been brought into play. The technical personnel also realized that employees and workers must be closely united in order to do a good job in production. At the beginning of the shock increase production movement in early November, a skilled worker was transferred from the Chen Shengming group. In order to shorten the oiling time with one less person, they desperately strengthened the intensity of labor. However, everyone was sweating profusely, but the downtime was not shortened much. Xu Xiaochun, the intern assistant in the factory, suggested that they learn the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method, and everyone should cooperate and operate by division of labor. However, the results of the workers' trial implementation were basically no different from the original segmented work method. So the workers consulted with Xu Xiaochun again, and as a result, they came up with a preliminary improvement method: they used one person to manage the head of the machine, and six people divided into two groups to cooperate on both sides of the fine spinning machine, with the result that the time to oil each machine was reduced from 45 minutes to 25 minutes. The workers' confidence was greatly improved. Later, with the help of Pan Zhensan, the head of the maintenance section, they tried out the round-robin method. In this way, after a month of experimentation, they finally created the round-robin cross-oiling method at the end of November.

Currently, the round-robin cross-oiling method has quickly spread to cotton mills in Shanghai. After seeing this news, the Dai Kedu group of the maintenance department of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill immediately held a meeting to discuss it, believing that this work method was much stronger than their group's mutual assistance and cooperation method, and that they must learn it well and consider applying this work method to flat car work. The East China Textile Administration has studied this work method and decided to promote it in all public and private cotton mills in the city, and decided to award the Chen Shengming group a bonus of 2 million yuan.

    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂
    陈生铭小组创造巡回交叉揩车工作法
    节省停车时间每年可使全厂多生产二百多件纱
    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂细纱机保全揩车小组陈生铭等七人，在爱国主义突击增产运动中，学习了郝建秀工作法的精神，创造了巡回交叉揩车工作法。他们揩一台车的时间已由四十五分钟减到二十分钟，创造了全国新纪录。他们每天揩十台车所节省的停车时间，可多纺八十七磅纱，全年可增产六五点二五件纱。这一工作法如在全厂推广，每年可多生产二百二十八点一二件纱，等于为国家增产二亿一千多万元的财富，如在全上海公私营棉纺织厂推广，每年可增产五千件纱。
    巡回交叉工作法的特点是：（一）有规律的有一定路线的巡回交叉，使工人们的工作互相衔接，不浪费时间，不跑冤枉路。（二）精细的科学分工，使每个人的工作专职化，提高工作熟练程度。（三）原来几个人互不相关的个体劳动，变成像一个人一样的集体劳动。（四）由于揩车时间缩短，保全揩车工可以有充分时间进行揩车后的检查工作，延长机器寿命。
    陈生铭小组原来的揩车工作法，和上海其他厂一样，是分段工作法。就是把一台细纱机的周围长度分为几段，每人负责一段，从车架到车脚，上下各部分都由一个人来揩；揩一部分机件要拿一次工具，来回跑许多冤枉路；做得快的人还要等待做得慢的人，浪费许多时间。他们实行巡回交叉法后，除一个人专揩车头外，其余六人每人分担几项工作。揩车前各人把自己要用的工具放在一定的地方，用时顺手可拿，不要跑冤枉路。揩车时，六个人顺序地沿着一个方向巡回，第一个人作第一项工作，另外几个人在后面作第二第三项工作，如第一个人专拔锭子，第二个人就专加锭子油，第三个人专把锭子插回原位。到抬罗拉（细纱机部件）时，他们便进行交叉操作，四个人分成两组在车子两侧工作。当一组工人走向另一侧抬罗拉时，还可顺手做其他工作，不白跑路。这样六个人在整个揩车过程中有组织有规律地进行工作，不浪费一点时间和精力，因而使揩车效率大为提高。
    陈生铭小组的巡回交叉揩车工作法是在民主团结运动的基础上创造出来的。经过这个运动，厂内广大工人的生产积极性大大提高，发挥了互助团结精神，技术人员也认识到职员和工人必须亲密团结才能把生产搞好。十一月初突击增产运动开始时，陈生铭小组调走了一个熟练工人。他们为了在少一个人的情况下也要缩短揩车时间，就拚命地加强劳动强度。但是，大家累得满头大汗，停车时间却并没有缩短多少。厂里的实习助理员徐孝纯就向他们建议学习郝建秀工作法的精神，大家分工合作进行操作。但工人们试行的结果，基本上和原来的分段工作法并没有什么不同。于是工人们又找徐孝纯商量，结果想出了一个初步的改进办法：他们用一个人管车头，六个人分二组在细纱机两侧分工合作操作，结果每揩一部车的时间由四十五分钟减到二十五分钟。工人们信心大大提高。后来他们又在保全科科长潘震三的帮助下，试行巡回工作法。就这样，经过一个月的试验，他们终于在十一月底创造了巡回交叉揩车工作法。
    目前，巡回交叉揩车工作法已很快传播到上海各棉纺织厂。国营上海第二棉纺织厂保全部戴可都小组看到这个消息后，立刻开会讨论，认为这个工作法比他们小组的互助合作法强得多，一定要好好学习，并考虑把这一工作法运用到平车工作上去。华东纺织管理局已研究了这工作法，决定在全市各公私营棉纺织厂推广，并决定发给陈生铭小组奖金二百万元。　（新华社）
