    Beijing Private Fuhua Kiln
    Capitalist Exploitation of Workers' Wages - Relevant Departments Should Handle Promptly
    Editor: Jiang Zilong, the manager of the private Fuhua Kiln in the Tenth District of Beijing, deliberately withholds workers' wages. For example, worker Zhang Jinyu's wages from April to November this year were only paid more than 6 million yuan by Manager Jiang, and more than 1 million yuan is still owed. Worker Wang Youzhong has worked in this factory for fourteen months, but Manager Jiang only gave him some pocket money and still owes him more than 2.3 million yuan in wages. Wang Youzhong's hometown is a disaster area, and because he doesn't have money to send home, he can only watch his family go hungry. Cook Yang Fangcheng asked Jiang for 50,000 yuan to make cotton clothes because of the cold weather, but Jiang refused. There are many other similar examples. According to preliminary statistics, the capitalist of this kiln owes workers a total of 14 million yuan in wages. This situation cannot continue, and we request the relevant departments to handle it immediately.

    北京市私营复华窑
    资方克扣工人工资有关部门应迅速处理
    编辑同志：北京市十区私营复华窑经理姜子龙故意克扣工人工资。例如：工人张金玉自今年四月到十一月的工资，姜经理只付了六十多万元，还欠一百多万元。工人王有忠在这个厂干了十四个月的活，姜经理只给了些零用钱，共欠他工资二百三十多万元。王有忠家乡是灾区，因为没有钱汇到家里，只好眼看家里人挨饿。烧饭工人杨方成因为天冷，向姜支五万元做棉衣，但姜竟不答应。其他例子还很多。据初步统计，这个窑的资方共欠工人工资一千四百万元。这种情形不能再继续下去，请有关部门立即处理。
