    Transfer the Enthusiasm for Patriotic Donations to Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Donations of Airplanes and Cannons Strengthen the Fighting Power of the
        Volunteer Army
    The nationwide patriotic donation campaign will end in another week. This movement fully demonstrates the patriotic enthusiasm and great strength of the people across the country. As of December 21, the total donations and payments from the people nationwide have reached 46,178 billion yuan. This is enough to buy more than 3,000 fighter planes or more than 5,000 cannons.
    The results of our donation of airplanes and cannons are quickly seen on the Korean battlefield. From October 25 of last year, when the Volunteer Army went abroad to fight, to June 25 of this year, in eight months, the enemy forces on the Korean battlefield were annihilated by a total of more than 242,000 people, and 980 American aircraft were lost. These achievements are very great.
    Subsequently, the nationwide patriotic donation campaign further inspired the Volunteer Army's fighting enthusiasm and strengthened their firepower, enabling them to annihilate an even greater number of enemies. From June 26 to the end of November, in five months and five days, the enemy was annihilated by approximately 248,000 people, and 1,849 American aircraft were lost.
    The American aggressors, who used to boast about their "air superiority," are now expressing anxiety and unease. The American news agency, United Press, admitted: "Now the loss of American warplanes is greater than what it can replenish." The American magazine "Newsweek" said: "Ninety American jets are not enough to protect just eight bombers." An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on December 16 said despondently: "The facts of the Korean air war are not optimistic."
    American and British news agencies, which have always boasted about the ferocity of the American aggressor forces' artillery fire, have recently been forced to talk about the miserable conditions of the American and British troops after being hit by the Volunteer Army's fierce artillery fire. A British Reuters dispatch on November 18 said: The Volunteer Army's artillery fire is "unprecedentedly fierce," "artillery fire buried some British troops, blew the roofs off shelters, and filled the battlefield with smoke and dust."
    Those invading soldiers, who were originally low in morale, were terrified in the face of the Volunteer Army's fierce artillery fire. A British prisoner of war said, "Your shells come in groups, I squatted in the trench and didn't dare to lift my head or move."

    Launch a Patriotic Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to Continue Supporting the Volunteer Army
    The American aggressors' situation on the Korean battlefield is now even more difficult. On the one hand, they themselves know that continuing to fight will only lead to more disastrous defeats; on the other hand, they are afraid of peace, afraid of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue—when news of an agreement on the second agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations was released, American stocks immediately fell, which the American monopoly capitalists are unwilling to see. Their current approach is to play dead, continue to delay the Korean armistice negotiations, and prepare to delay the peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue in the future in order to maintain a state of "long-term tension." Therefore, the people across the country need to use even greater strength to support the Volunteer Army. Only in this way can we force the American aggressors to accept fair and reasonable negotiation conditions, achieve a Korean armistice, and continue to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. If the American imperialists dare to undermine the armistice negotiations, we will be able to strike them even more severely. Even if the armistice is achieved, only by continuing to strengthen our forces can we prevent the American aggressors from launching another war.
    Now, what methods can everyone use to continue supporting the Volunteer Army? The best way is to increase production and practice economy. The role of increasing production and practicing economy in supporting the front lines and consolidating national defense is just as important as donating airplanes and cannons. Everyone only needs to look at the figures for increased production and savings proposed by certain departments published in the newspapers to know. The national state-owned trading enterprises alone plan to increase production and save 11 trillion yuan next year. This amount is more than twice the total donations from the people across the country this year.

    Learn from the Experience of the Weapon Donation Movement and Do a Good Job in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    At the beginning of the donation movement in early June this year, the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association called on the people across the country to launch a movement to increase production and increase income. Many regions, many units, and many people did this during the donation movement, and achieved good results. For example, as a result of the increase production and donation movement launched by the workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in Shanxi Province this year, they not only overfulfilled the plan to donate a "Tai Steel" fighter plane, but also increased production for the country by 98 million catties of millet in four months. Farmers in the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province, because they did a good job in increasing production for donations, harvested 300 million catties more of agricultural crops. After many private factories in Shanghai signed labor-management contracts for increased production and donations, they improved production, improved management, and the output of paper mills generally exceeded the quota by more than 20 percent.
    These achievements deserve everyone's attention, and everyone should carefully summarize these successful experiences, which can help everyone do a better job in the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement.
    For example, many state-owned factories and enterprises proposed and implemented many rationalization proposals in this year's increase production and donation movement, improved output quality, saved raw materials, reduced costs, improved labor organization, and improved technology. If these units carefully summarize their experience, consolidate their original achievements, and expand their original achievements, it will be a solid foundation for launching the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement.
    For example, many rural areas this year developed mutual aid organizations, improved farming techniques, and strengthened fertilization, seed selection, drought resistance, and pest control in order to increase production for donations. These are still the tasks to be done in the current patriotic increase production and practice economy movement in rural areas to increase yield per unit area.
    For example, many private enterprises this year signed labor-management contracts for increased production and donations, in which labor and management agreed to find production quotas, and a portion of the income from exceeding the quota was donated to airplanes and cannons; another portion was used as bonuses for employees and to run employee welfare undertakings; and another portion belonged to the capitalists and was used to expand production. The labor and management of these enterprises should continue to negotiate and re-stipulate a reasonable method for distributing the increased income from increased production and savings, and launch a patriotic increase production and practice economy movement.
    During this year's patriotic donation movement, all parts of the country strengthened patriotic propaganda and education, raised the political consciousness of the people across the country, and established many regular propaganda organizations. Many people incorporated the goals of increasing production and donations into patriotic pacts, and strengthened current affairs studies and political studies, and established many newspaper reading groups and study organizations. These achievements should continue to be consolidated and expanded in the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement.
    In general, although the donation work is about to end, everything created by every place, every unit, and every person in the patriotic donation movement should continue to be adhered to and continuously improved. However, some people think this way: I am not an employee of a state-owned enterprise or a state agency, and now that I am not donating, increasing production and practicing economy is my personal business, and it doesn't matter whether I do it or not. Therefore, some people were very energetic in increasing production and practicing economy during the donation movement, but relaxed after the donation plan was completed. This is not right. People who do not work in state-owned enterprises and state agencies, if they do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy and increase their income, everyone can invest the accumulated funds in production, which also increases wealth for our motherland. This is beneficial to both the country and oneself. Moreover, in the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement, it is also necessary to oppose corruption, oppose waste, oppose bureaucracy, eliminate all behaviors that harm the interests of the country and the interests of the people, and establish a good atmosphere of everyone cherishing public property. This is the responsibility that every patriotic person should fulfill. For example, we should all rise up to expose corrupt elements and expose wasteful phenomena. For example, peasant comrades should respond to the government's various calls and do a good job in paying patriotic public grain, patriotic cotton sales, grain sales, and other tasks; the business community should oppose profiteering, oppose speculation, oppose tax evasion, and improve business management under the leadership of the state-owned economy. People from all walks of life across the country can participate in the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement, and have a responsibility to participate in this movement. This year, because everyone enthusiastically participated in the patriotic increase production and donation movement, the achievements of the donation movement were great. In the future, we should continue to carry forward the patriotic spirit and strive to achieve greater results in the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement.

### 把爱国捐献的热情转到增产节约上去

专栏：宣传员讲话

    把爱国捐献的热情转到增产节约上去
    捐献飞机大炮加强了志愿军的
        战斗威力
    全国人民的爱国捐献运动，再过一星期就要结束了。这个运动，充分地表现了全国人民的爱国热情和伟大力量。到十二月二十一日为止，全国人民的捐献缴款已经有四万六千一百七十八亿元。可以买三千多架战斗机，或者买五千多门大炮。
    我们捐献飞机大炮的成绩，很快就在朝鲜战场上看出来了。从去年十月二十五日志愿军出国作战开始到今年六月二十五日为止的八个月内，朝鲜战场上的敌军一共被歼灭了二十四万二千多人，美国飞机损失了九百八十架，这些战绩是很伟大的。
    接着，全国人民的爱国捐献运动，更加鼓舞了志愿军的战斗热情，同时也加强了志愿军的炮火威力，使他们歼灭敌人的数量更为增多。从六月二十六日到十一月底的五个月零五天里，敌人就被歼灭了二十四万八千人左右，美国飞机则损失了一千八百四十九架。
    曾经胡吹他们的什么“空中优势”的美国侵略者，现在已经在表示焦灼不安了。美国通讯社合众社承认：“现在美国作战飞机的损失比它能够补充的要多。”美国杂志“新闻周刊”说：“九十架美国喷气式机还不足以保护仅仅八架轰炸机。”美联社十二月十六日在汉城发出的电报里灰心丧气地说：“朝鲜空战的事实是很不令人乐观的。”
    一向吹嘘美国侵略军炮火厉害的美、英通讯社，近来也不得不说说美、英军队被志愿军猛烈炮火打击以后的惨状。英国路透社十一月十八日发出的电报里说：志愿军的炮火是“空前厉害的”，“炮火把一些英国军队埋起来，掀掉掩蔽壕的顶盖，把战场打得烟尘滚滚。”
    那些本来是士气低落的侵略军士兵，在志愿军的猛烈炮火面前丧魂失魄了。一个英军俘虏说：“你们的炮弹是一群一群飞来的，我蹲在壕沟里头也不敢抬，动也不敢动。”
    开展爱国增产节约运动，继续支援志愿军
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场的处境，现在是更加困难了。一方面，他们自己也知道继续打下去只有更惨重的失败；另一方面，他们又害怕和平，害怕朝鲜问题的和平解决——朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程取得协议的消息传出时，美国的股票马上就跌价，这是美国的垄断资本家所不愿意的。他们现在的办法就是耍死狗，继续拖延朝鲜停战的谈判，并准备在将来拖延整个朝鲜问题的和平解决，来维持“长期紧张”的局面。所以，全国人民需要用更大的力量来支援志愿军，只有这样，才能迫使美国侵略者接受公平合理的谈判条件，使朝鲜停战实现，并继续争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。如果美帝国主义敢于破坏停战谈判，我们就能够更严重地打击它。就是停战实现了，也只有继续加强我们的力量，才能使美国侵略者不敢再发动战争。
    现在大家用什么方法来继续支持志愿军呢？最好的办法就是增产节约。增产节约对于支援前线、巩固国防的作用，和捐献飞机大炮同样重要。大家只要看看报上发表过的某些部门提出来的增产节约的数目字就可以知道。单只全国国营贸易企业，就计划明年增产节约十一万亿元。这个数目就有全国人民今年捐献总数的两倍多。
    吸取捐献武器运动的经验，搞好增产节约
    今年六月初捐献运动刚刚开始的时候，抗美援朝总会就号召全国人民开展一个增加生产、增加收入的运动。许多地区、许多单位、许多人在捐献运动中这样做了，收到了很好的效果。例如山西太原钢铁厂的职工，今年开展增产捐献运动的结果，不独超额完成了捐献“太钢号”战斗机一架的计划，还在四个月里给国家增产了九千八百万斤小米的财富。河北省天津专区的农民，因为增产捐献工作搞得好，农业作物多收了三亿斤。上海许多私营工厂订出了劳资增产捐献合同之后，提高了生产，改善了经营管理，造纸业各厂产量普遍超过定额百分之二十以上。
    这些成绩是值得大家重视的，大家应该好好地总结这些成功的经验，这可以帮助大家把爱国增产节约运动搞得更好。
    比如，有很多国营工厂企业在今年的增产捐献运动中，提出和实行了许多合理化建议，提高了产量质量、节省了原料材料、降低了成本、改进了劳动组织、提高了技术。这些单位如果好好地总结经验，巩固原有的成绩，扩大原有的成绩，就是开展爱国增产节约运动的稳固基础。
    又如，许多农村今年为了增产捐献，发展了互助组织，改进了耕作技术，加强了施肥、选种、抗旱、治虫等工作。这些，仍是现在农村中开展爱国增产节约运动，提高单位面积产量所要做的工作。
    又如，许多私营企业今年订立了劳资增产捐献合同，由劳资双方协议，找出生产定额，把超过定额生产的收入，一部分捐献飞机大炮；一部分作为职工的奖金和用来举办职工福利事业；另一部分归资方，用来扩大生产。这些企业的劳资双方应该继续协商，重新规定合理地分配增产节约所增加的收入的办法，开展爱国增产节约运动。
    在今年的爱国捐献运动中，全国各地都加强了爱国主义的宣传教育工作，提高了全国人民的政治觉悟，并且建立了许多经常性的宣传组织。许多人把增产捐献目标订入了爱国公约，并且加强了时事学习和政治学习，成立了很多读报组和学习组织。这些成绩，在爱国增产节约运动中，应该继续巩固和扩大。
    总起来说，现在捐献工作虽然要结束了，但每个地方、每个单位、每个人在爱国捐献运动中的一切创造，都应该继续坚持下来，并且不断提高。可是，有的人这样想：我不是国营企业和国家机关的职工，现在不捐献了，增产节约是我个人的事，搞不搞都可以。所以，有的人在捐献运动中搞增产节约很有劲，捐献计划完成之后就松懈下来了。这是不对的。不在国营企业和国家机关里工作的人，搞好了增产节约，增加了收入，大家可以把积累起来的资金投入生产，这也是为我们的祖国增加了财富。这对国家，对自己都是有利的。而且在爱国增产节约运动中，还要反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义，要消灭一切损害国家利益、损害人民利益的行为，建立起人人爱护公共财产的风气。这是每
    一个爱国人民都要尽的责任。比如，我们大家都应该起来检举贪污分子，揭发浪费现象。又如，农民同志们应该响应政府的各项号召，做好缴纳爱国公粮、爱国售棉、售粮等工作；工商界应该反对暴利思想、反对投机、反对偷税漏税，并在国营经济的领导下，改善经营管理。全国各阶层人民都能够参加爱国增产节约运动，而且有责任要参加这个运动。今年，因为大家都热烈参加爱国增产捐献运动，所以捐献运动的成绩很大。今后我们应该继续发扬爱国精神，争取在爱国增产节约运动中取得更大的成绩。
