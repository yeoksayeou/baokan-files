    Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Paris Tonight reporter, Bertrand, reported from Kaesong on the 16th: The armistice negotiations in Panmunjom are now deadlocked on agenda items three and four. Analyzing the main points of disagreement and the reasons used by the US side to justify their delaying actions, it can be seen that the US side only wants a ceasefire agreement in the negotiations that allows them to resume hostilities at the time most favorable to them. The first major point of contention is the issue of troop rotation and arms replenishment. The US side originally demanded that military strength should not be increased. The Korean and Chinese side put forward a better proposal, suggesting a phased withdrawal of foreign troops. However, the US side rejected this proposal, so the Korean and Chinese side suggested that personnel and weapons should not enter Korea, and that neutral countries should supervise this. The US side, however, demanded the right to rotate troops. The Korean and Chinese side agreed to this suggestion and proposed that the number of rotations should be limited to 5,000 per month. But the US side believes that this number is not enough and demands the right to replace old weapons with new weapons, and replace empty ammunition boxes with full ammunition boxes. In other words, what they are demanding in the meeting tent every day now is exactly the opposite of what they originally demanded. They demand the right to increase their military strength during the armistice. Why is this? At the same time, they demand restrictions on military facilities in North Korea, including a complete ban on the construction of airports (a task that the US side admits it is currently stepping up and that they are unable to stop). The US side seems to be demanding the right to further bombard North Korea, which cannot be effectively defended, at a time that suits them - perhaps when aircraft production speeds are not as low as they are now and can cope with combat losses. In order to ensure that airports are not repaired and rebuilt, they also demand aerial reconnaissance. General Xie Fang believes that this is an unreasonable interference in the internal affairs of Korea. Tanner yesterday openly and arbitrarily replied: "Frankly speaking, we interfere in your internal affairs by cutting off your rear lines of communication and destroying your rear communication centers, and by conducting frequent aerial surveillance." Tanner's reasoning is that the armistice should not hinder this "right." General Xie Fang clearly told the US side that these two demands were absolutely unacceptable. He said: "You know very well that we have consistently and firmly opposed these demands in the past, but you have not shown any intention of abandoning these unreasonable demands. ... You have the right to take the attitude you want to take, but if you do not take a negotiating attitude, then the responsibility for delaying the negotiations should be borne by you."
    The US side has refused to discuss the substance of the fourth item on the agenda for a week now. They themselves have not put forward any proposal for the release of prisoners, and they refuse to discuss the very specific five-point plan put forward by the Korean and Chinese side (which stipulates that all prisoners should be released immediately upon the signing of the armistice agreement). Why is this? They do not want the Korean and Chinese side to gain "military advantages." They do not want to return "well-trained soldiers" if they return more than they receive. If the US side is not planning to re-launch the war, then why do they want to keep the prisoners? Even before discussing the principle of releasing prisoners, the US side demanded to know the number and names of the prisoners. Today, General Li Xiangchao said that the Korean and Chinese side can let the US side know the names, numbers, and nationalities of all the prisoners held by the Korean and Chinese side, as well as the addresses of the prisoner-of-war camps, and change this from the fifth point to the second point in the current proposal of the Korean and Chinese side. As soon as the representatives of the US side's subcommittee agree to the first point - determining the principle of releasing all prisoners detained by both sides - this material can be handed over to them immediately. But the US side refused this suggestion. General Li Xiangchao said: "All the prisoners and the people of the world are waiting for your reply to see if you want to release all the prisoners. The relatives and friends of the prisoners are also waiting for your reply." The American, Libby, could not answer this question. The reason is: "We don't want to buy a pig in a poke." The Korean and Chinese side told him that the Korean and Chinese side had no intention of buying or selling prisoners and would continue to insist on the release of all prisoners. According to people who have just visited the prisoner-of-war camp, the prisoners are wearing blue, warm winter cotton uniforms and are "as fat as butter."

    美方继续采取蛮横无理态度
    已使三四两项议程陷于僵局
    【新华社十七日讯】法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌十六日自开城报道：板门店的停火谈判现在已在第三、四两项议程上陷于僵局。把主要分歧点和美方用来为他们的拖延行动辩解的理由加以分析，就可以看出：美方在谈判中只是想求得一个使他们可以在对他们最有利的时间恢复敌对行动的停战协议。第一个大分歧点就是轮换军队和补充武器问题。美方原来要求不准增强军事力量。朝中方面提出了更好的建议，建议分阶段撤退外国军队。但美方拒绝这个建议，于是朝中方面建议不准人员和武器进入朝鲜，并由中立国进行监督。美方却要求有权轮换军队。朝中方面同意了这个建议，并主张应把轮换的人数限为每月五千人。但是美方认为这个数目不够，并要求有权把旧武器换成新武器，用满装的弹药箱来换掉空弹药箱。换句话说，现在他们每天在会议帐篷中提出的要求，和他们自己原来的要求恰恰相反。他们要求有权在停战期间增强他们的军事力量。这是为了什么呢？同时他们要求对朝鲜北部的军事设施加以限制，包括绝对禁止修建飞机场（这是美方自己承认目前正在加紧进行而且他们无力阻止的一种工作）。美方似乎是要求有权在对他们适合的时机——也许是当飞机生产速度已经不像目前这样低、并能应付战斗损失的时候——对无法进行有效防御的北朝鲜进一步滥施轰炸。为了保证飞机场不得修复和重建，他们并要求进行空中侦察。解方将军认为这是无理地干涉朝鲜的内政。滕纳昨天公然蛮横无理地答复说：“老实说，我们切断你们后方的交通线和破坏你们后方的交通中心，并经常进行空中监视，就是干涉你们的内政。”滕纳的推论是：停战不应使这种“权利”受到妨碍。解方将军明确地告诉美方说：这两个要求是绝对不能接受的。他说：“你们明明知道，过去我们一贯地坚决反对这种要求，但是你们丝毫没有放弃这种无理主张的意思。……你们有权采取你们愿意采取的态度，但是如果你们不采取协商的态度，那末，拖延谈判的责任就应该由你们来负。”
    美方拒绝讨论第四项议程的实质，到现在已经有
    一周了。他们自己并没有提出释放俘虏的建议，他们拒绝讨论朝中方面提出的很具体的五点计划（这个计划规定一俟停战协议签订就立即释放全部俘虏）。这是为什么呢？他们不希望让朝中方面得到 “军事利益”。他们不希望放回“训练有素的士兵”，如果他们放回的比他们所接受的为多的话。如果美方不是计划重新发动战争的话，那末他们为何要保留俘虏呢？甚至在讨论释放俘虏的原则以前美方就要求知道俘虏的人数和姓名。今天，李相朝将军说，朝中方面可以让美方知道朝中方面手中的一切俘虏的姓名、人数及国籍以及战俘营的地址，并把这一点由朝中方面现在建议中的第五点改为第二点。一俟美方小组委员会代表同意第一点——确定释放双方所拘留的全部俘虏的原则——，这项材料就立即可以交给他们。但是美方拒绝这一建议。李相朝将军说：“全体俘虏、全世界人民都在等待你方的答复、看你们是否要释放全部俘虏。俘虏们的亲属和友人也在等待你方的答复。”这个问题美国利比不能作答。理由是：“我们不要买装在袋子里的猪。”朝中方面告诉他说：朝中方面无意买卖俘虏并将继续坚持释放全部俘虏。据刚才访问过战俘营回来的人们说：俘虏们穿着蓝色的温暖的冬季棉制服，“胖得像牛油一样”。
