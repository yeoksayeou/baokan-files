To the Editor:

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, some employees in business departments in the Northeast region lack sufficient understanding of the movement. They believe: "We handle business matters, not cash, so what corruption could there be!" "We have systems for handling affairs, so where is the waste!" "We are all 'small' cadres, so even if there is bureaucracy, the waste is not significant..." The recent work inspection on anti-corruption and anti-waste at the Northeast Egg Products Company proved these arguments to be wrong. Comrade Gao Yi, an employee of the company's business office, once made a mistake in the number on a withdrawal slip, and the person responsible for reviewing it also failed to catch it. As a result, the bank refused payment, leading to a three-day delay in settlement, with a total loss of interest, telephone charges, and postage amounting to over 1.9 million yuan. On another occasion, employee Yang Xiexing took the wrong document, which was also not detected at the time, resulting in another three-day delay in settlement and a loss of over 1.6 million yuan. Furthermore, in another instance, the company manager and the business office director believed that the amount involved in an export should be settled in Beijing was not large. For convenience, they suggested to superiors that the settlement be transferred to Shenyang, but it took a month to resolve, resulting in a loss of over 27.5 million yuan in interest and an additional expenditure of over 35 million yuan in handling fees. Once, when receipts for exported goods were returned, they should have been forwarded from the business section to the export section, but Wang Ru'en, the head of the business section, sent them to the financial accounting section, resulting in an eight-day delay and a loss of over 2.6 million yuan in interest. The above four items totaled a loss of 69.4 million yuan. These facts, which may not be immediately apparent but actually cause significant waste, strongly refute the erroneous arguments that "business departments have no waste." In fact, anyone who is careless or lacks a sense of responsibility in their work will unknowingly cause waste of people's property.

### 在反贪污反浪费运动中  反对“业务部门没有浪费”的错误论调

    在反贪污反浪费运动中
    反对“业务部门没有浪费”的错误论调
    编辑同志：东北地区有些业务部门的职员对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动认识不足，他们认为：“我们是搞业务的，不管现金，有什么可贪污的！”“我们办事都有制度，又有什么可浪费的！”“我们都是‘小’干部，即便有官僚主义，浪费也不大……”。东北蛋品公司在最近反贪污浪费的工作检查中，证明了这些论调是错误的。该公司业务室职员高毅同志有一次曾将一个领款单据上的数目字点错了，负责复核的人也未检查出来，因此银行拒绝付款，结果晚结汇三天，共损失利息、电话费、邮费计一百九十多万元。另一次职员杨协行拿错了单据，当时也未被检查出来，结果又晚结汇三天，损失一百六十多万元。还有一次本来应到北京结汇，但公司经理和业务室主任认为数字不大，为了方便，向上级建议转沈阳结汇，但一直拖了一个月才得到解决，以致损失利息二千七百五十多万元；多花手续费三千五百多万元。有一次对外出口的货物收据返回，应当先由业务课交出口课，但业务课长王汝恩却交到财务会计课，以致压了八天，损失利息二百六十多万元。以上四项共损失人民币六千九百四十多万元。像这些一时看不出，但实际上却造成很大浪费的事实，都有力地回答了那些认为“业务部门没有浪费”等错误的论调。事实上，凡是在工作中存在着粗枝大叶，或责任心不够的人，都会无形中造成人民财产的浪费。    周锐武
