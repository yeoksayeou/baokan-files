To the Editor:

    With the increasing prosperity of the national economic market, the industrial and commercial circles of Suzhou are also facing a new situation of "the off-season is not weak, and the peak season is even more prosperous." However, many industrial and commercial households still have remnants of the "bad practices" of the old society, which affect the development of industry and commerce. At the Suzhou "Production Improvement Exhibition for Private Enterprises," I saw that some industrialists and businessmen, in order to pursue "exorbitant profits," used many methods to deceive customers. They adopted methods such as adulteration, haggling, secret language, large bushels and small scales, auction sales, and raffles. Among them, the "Rolling Dragon Lever Scale" could reduce 40 jin on the scale when buying 100 jin of real objects, and increase 60 jin when selling. One in and one out could exploit 100 jin. In addition to collecting internal and external commissions, the mountain product industry also used pretexts such as lifting power, warehouse fees, return shipping, and tips to harshly exploit farmers. This exhibition has greatly educated the industrial and commercial circles, and some industrialists and businessmen with bad practices have written letters of determination, expressing their determination to resolutely correct them.
    I believe that this kind of exhibition is a good method to help the industrial and commercial circles reform bad practices, establish new morals, and transform bad business methods. This kind of exhibition is worth promoting in various places.

    苏州举办私营企业生产改进展览会的方法值得提倡
    编辑同志：随着全国经济市场的日益繁荣，苏州市工商界也面临着一个“淡季不淡，旺季更旺”的新气象。但不少工商业户还残存着旧社会的“陋规”现象，影响了工商业的发展。我在苏州市“私营企业生产改进展览会”上，看到有些工商业者为了追求“暴利”，曾用很多方法来欺瞒顾客。他们采用了掺杂做假、讨价还价、切口暗语、大斗小秤、拍店大卖、摸彩等办法。其中如“滚龙机关秤”，可以使一百斤的实物，在买进时秤面上减少四十斤，卖出时增加六十斤。一出一进，就可以剥削一百斤。山货业除收内外佣金以外，还用吊力、栈力、回舱、小费等名目对农民进行苛刻的剥削。这次展览会给工商界以很大教育，某些有陋规行为的工商业者写了决心书，表示要坚决改正。
    我认为这种展览会，是帮助工商界改革陋规，树立新道德，改造不良经营方式的好方法。这种展览会在各地都值得提倡。    子飞
