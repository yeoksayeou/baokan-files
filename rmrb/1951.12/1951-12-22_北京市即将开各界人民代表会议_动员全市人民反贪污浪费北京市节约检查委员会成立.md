(Beijing News Agency Report) The Beijing Third People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held a joint meeting yesterday (the 21st), deciding to discuss and mobilize the city to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy at the upcoming Third Session of the Third People's Representative Conference. This movement will lead the city in exposing corrupt and wasteful elements and besieging corrupt phenomena. After the city's People's Representative Conference convenes, districts, villages, streets, factories, and government offices will hold representative conferences or mass meetings to launch this struggle.

    Mobilizing the city to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is the main topic of this meeting. After Chairman Peng Zhen of the Municipal Consultative Committee explained the above issues, the participating committee members enthusiastically expressed their opinions, exposing the phenomena of corruption and waste in various units and aspects. They unanimously agreed that the phenomena of corruption and waste are very serious, and it is very necessary to launch a large-scale anti-corruption and anti-waste movement throughout the city.

    Su Min, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee and Deputy Director of the Beijing Farmers Association, said: In the past, we did not lead farmers well in opposing waste and promoting new and simple ways of doing things, saving money to expand production. Therefore, there is a phenomenon of extravagance and waste among farmers in the suburbs. For example, a youth league branch secretary in the northern suburbs wasted 5,000 catties of corn for his wedding, and as a result, his wife had no food to eat after entering the house. The phenomenon of corruption is also serious in the suburbs. In the past, we have continuously punished it, but we have not yet thoroughly eliminated the phenomenon of corruption on a large scale. The phenomenon of corruption is not only present in government agencies; for example, four elementary schools in the northern suburbs have discovered corruption cases. Some people even embezzled the people's donations for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Some individual unit leaders are afraid of exposing corruption and waste incidents, fearing "losing face," so they suppress democracy and do not allow people to report corruption and waste incidents. These bureaucratic elements should be punished. Zhang Hongshun, Zhu Changjiang, Li Guorui, and others exposed the phenomena of corruption and waste in factories and enterprises. Zhang Hongshun said: The phenomenon of waste is very serious in factories and enterprises. There are also many corruption incidents, both in large and small factories. The funds of grassroots trade union organizations have also been embezzled. Therefore, we should concentrate our efforts on fighting corruption. We should start with cadres first, and then mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement. Zhu Changjiang said: "There is a lot of waste in electricity consumption in various factories and enterprises. For example, the utilization rate of power equipment in the Eastern Suburbs People's Paper Mill is less than 50% on average. After testing and research with the assistance of the Electricity Bureau, 300 kilowatts of transformers can be removed without affecting production at all, but 210 million yuan of transformers can be saved. In addition, more than 51,800 kilowatt-hours of electricity can be consumed less each year, saving more than 44 million yuan in electricity bills." Li Guorui said: "Last year, the Water Company made a batch of water pipes, which were reworked because the large and small mouths did not fit, wasting 20 million yuan. Therefore, the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement is also necessary in factories."

    Lei Jieqiong, Liang Sicheng, Xu Chubo, Tang Yongtong, Zheng Yun, Wang Zhixiang, and others pointed out that the phenomenon of waste is also very common in schools and other aspects. Lei Jieqiong said: "Many students sleep with the lights on and do not turn off the faucets... Students think that these are all 'minor details of life,' not politics, and can be ignored. We should strengthen their education on loving the motherland and protecting public property." Liang Sicheng said: Some students at Tsinghua University do not cherish the school's equipment, so that tables and chairs are often damaged, wasting a lot of repair costs. He also gave an example from his family to illustrate that small wastes can lead to large losses. Someone in his family always does not tighten the faucet when turning it off, always letting a thread of water flow. He calculated that he lived in Tsinghua University for four and a half years, and the wasted water was equivalent to more than 1,290 catties of millet. He also pointed out that there is a lot of waste in Beijing's construction projects, one is the tangible waste of building materials such as bricks and tiles; the other is the intangible waste of poor design. Xu Chubo reported on the recent anti-waste movement in the Municipal No. 1 Boys' High School. He said that some electricity and food have been saved in the past month. Tang Yongtong said: "This movement should be expanded and deepened. Every unit should not only eliminate internal corruption, but also jointly transform the social environment, so that corrupt elements have no loopholes to exploit."

    Shu Sheyu exposed the extravagance and waste in the literary and art circles, saying: "The extravagance and waste in the literary and art circles is very serious. A living newspaper play in Shanghai to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea used more than 200 people and 70 scenes, and lost more than 80 million yuan in two months. A certain troupe in Zhangjiakou spent 480,000 yuan on travel expenses to Beijing to buy a few paper flowers, which is a great waste. We should eliminate the extravagant and wasteful style on the stage." Chen Mingde also proposed to thoroughly correct the phenomenon of extravagance and waste and the idea of enjoyment, and promote the style of hard work and simplicity. Fu Huating, Le Songsheng, Liu Yifeng, and others, director, deputy director, and members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, explained that the industrial and commercial circles are preparing to mobilize all industrial and commercial households in the city on a large scale to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement. Fu Huating said: "The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce is preparing to hold a conference soon to mobilize the city's industrial and commercial circles to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement. Some people in our industrial and commercial circles often bribe staff members of government agencies. Bribery and accepting bribes are both criminal acts. We want to call on unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen who have offered bribes to confess their crimes and call on all industrialists and businessmen to report various crimes of bribery and accepting bribes." Le Songsheng said: "The industrial and commercial circles should vigorously publicize the policy that bribery and accepting bribes are equally punished, and those who confess will be treated leniently." Liu Yifeng said: "In the recent corruption cases, many are related to illegal merchants. These are scum in the industrial and commercial circles who seduce staff members of government agencies to commit corruption. Therefore, our industrial and commercial circles should generally mobilize the masses to report corrupt elements, and at the same time enlighten illegal merchants to confess the facts of bribery, so that the government can deal with them leniently. Through this movement, we can also eliminate the illegal and bad habits in our industrial and commercial circles."

    Next, the meeting discussed the re-election of representatives to the city's People's Representative Conference, and on the spot, Wu Han and 18 others were elected to organize an election committee to lead people from all walks of life to elect representatives to the Fourth People's Representative Conference after the term of the Third People's Representative Conference expires, using the election methods of last year.

    Finally, in a warm atmosphere, the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee commended the achievements of the city's public security personnel in consolidating the revolutionary order of the capital; at the same time, Comrade Peng Zhen, on behalf of the Municipal People's Government, awarded an honorary certificate to Shu Sheyu (i.e., Lao She), the author of the famous play "Dragon Beard Ditch," at which point the entire venue resounded with warm applause.

    北京市即将开各界人民代表会议
    动员全市人民反贪污浪费
    北京市节约检查委员会成立
    【北京市新闻处讯】北京市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会和北京市人民政府委员会，昨天
    （二十一日）举行联席会议，决定在最近即将召开的第三届第三次各界人民代表会议上，讨论并动员全市人民开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，领导全市人民检举贪污、浪费分子对贪污腐化现象进行围剿。市各界人民代表会议开会以后，区、村、街道、工厂、机关等处，都将召开代表会议或群众大会，展开这个斗争。
    动员全市人民开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，是这次会议的主要议题。市协商委员会彭真主席对上述问题作了说明后，到会各委员热烈发表意见，揭发了各单位各方面的贪污浪费现象。他们
    一致认为：贪污浪费现象是很严重的，在全市大张旗鼓地开展反贪污、反浪费运动，是非常必要的。
    市协商委员会委员、北京市农民协会副主任苏民说：过去我们没有很好领导农民反对浪费，提倡新事新办，省下钱来扩大生产。所以郊区农民有铺张浪费的现象。比如北郊有个青年团支部书记，结婚时浪费了五千斤玉米，结果老婆进门后，就没饭吃了。贪污现象在郊区也是严重的，过去，我们曾经不断惩处，但是，还没有大张旗鼓地肃清贪污现象。贪污的现象，并不只是政府机关有，例如北郊就有四个小学发现了贪污事件。有的人甚至贪污了人民群众的抗美援朝捐款。甚至有个别单位的负责人对于贪污、浪费事件，怕暴露出来，怕“丢脸”，因此压制民主，不许人检举贪污、浪费的事件。这种官僚主义分子，应该受到制裁。张鸿舜、朱长江、李国瑞等揭发了工厂企业中的贪污浪费现象。张鸿舜说：浪费现象在工厂企业中很严重。贪污的事件也不少，大、小工厂都有。工会基层组织的经费也有被贪污了的。所以我们应该集中力量来反贪污。先从干部中作起，然后再发动群众，大力开展反贪污、反浪费运动。朱长江说：“各工厂企业在用电上有很大的浪费。如东郊人民造纸厂的电力设备，平均利用率还不到百分之五十。经过电业局协助测验研究，可撤消三百瓩的变压器，对生产毫无影响，可是省了两亿一千万元的变压器。另外，一年还可少消耗五万一千八百多度电，省四千四百多万元的电费。”李国瑞说：“去年自来水公司做一批水管，因为大小口套不上，又反工，浪费了两千万元。因此，反贪污、反浪费运动在工厂中也是必要的。”
    雷洁琼、梁思成、徐楚波、汤用彤、郑芸、王之相等纷纷指出浪费的现象在学校等方面也很普遍，雷洁琼说：“许多学生开着灯睡觉，不关水龙头……学生们认为这些都是‘生活小节’，不是政治，可以不管。我们应当对他们加强爱祖国、爱护公共财物的教育。”梁思成说：清华大学有些同学不爱护学校的用具，以致桌椅常有损坏，浪费了不少修理费。他并举出他家里的一个例子，说明小的浪费也可以形成大的损失。他家里有人关水龙头时总不拧紧，老让像一条毛线细的水在流。他计算了一下，他在清华大学住了四年半，浪费的水就合一千二百九十多斤小米。他还指出北京市建筑工程中有不少浪费，一种是砖瓦等建筑器材的有形浪费；一种是设计不好的无形浪费。徐楚波报告了最近市立男一中开展反浪费运动的情况。他说一个月来已经节约了一些电力和粮食。汤用彤说：“这个运动应该扩大，应该深入。每一个单位不但要肃清内部的贪污现象，还应当合力改造社会环境，使贪污分子无孔可入。”
    舒舍予揭发了文艺界中的铺张浪费现象，他说：“文艺界的铺张浪费现象是很严重的。上海演个抗美援朝的活报剧，用了二百多人、七十个景，演两个月，赔了八千多万元。张家口某剧团到北京来买几朵纸花，就花了四十八万元的路费，这是一种很大的浪费。我们应该消灭舞台上的铺张浪费作风。”陈铭德也提出要彻底纠正铺张浪费的现象和享乐思想，提倡艰苦朴素的作风。 工商联合会主任委员、副主任委员、委员傅华亭、乐松生、刘一峰等说明工商界准备大张旗鼓地动员全市工商户，开展反贪污、反浪费运动。傅华亭说：“北京市工商联合会准备在最近召开大会，动员全市工商界开展反贪污、反浪费运动。我们工商界有些人常向机关工作人员行贿，行贿受贿同是犯罪行为。我们要号召行贿的不法工商业者，坦白自己的罪行，并号召全体工商业家检举各种行贿和受贿的罪行。”乐松生说：“工商界要大力宣传行贿、受贿同等治罪、谁坦白就从轻处理的政策。”刘一峰说：“最近发现的贪污案件中，有很多和不法商人有关系，这是工商界中的败类，勾引政府机关工作人员贪污。因此，我们工商界应普遍发动群众，检举贪污分子，同时也要启发不法商人自己坦白行贿的事实，这样政府可以从轻处理。经过这次运动，也可以肃清我们工商界中不法的坏作风。”
    接着，会议讨论了本市各界人民代表会议代表的改选问题，当场推选吴晗等十九人组织选举委员会，领导各界人民在第三届各界人民代表会议任期届满后，采用去年的选举办法，产生第四届各界人民代表会议的代表。
    最后，在热烈的气氛中市人民政府和市各界人民代表会议协商委员会，表扬了全市公安工作人员巩固首都革命秩序的功绩；同时，彭真同志代表市人民政府以荣誉奖状授予名剧“龙须沟”的作者舒舍予（即老舍），这时，整个会场响起了热烈的掌声。
