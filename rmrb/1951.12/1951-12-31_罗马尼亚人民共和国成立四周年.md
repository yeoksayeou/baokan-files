The Romanian people celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic on December 30 this year. Four years ago, under the leadership of the working class party, the working people overthrew the monarchy, which served as the agent of imperialism and the last bastion of reactionary forces, and established a new type of state—the Romanian People's Republic—a state belonging to the working people, whose power belongs to the working class in alliance with the working peasants.

The overthrow of the monarchy opened the way for the working people of Romania to build a strong, free, and independent people's republic, and opened the glorious road to socialism.

Significant political, economic, and social changes have taken place in Romania in the past four years. Now, power belongs to the working people. People's congresses at all levels have replaced the old organs of power, and their more than 110,000 members come from all strata of the working people. Through the people's congresses, the broad masses of the working people participate in the work of managing state affairs.

The Romanian people have gained the highest freedom and rights, national independence, the right to be masters of the country, and the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The entire country has now become a huge construction site for peaceful construction.

The nationalization of the main means of production has created the necessary conditions for implementing a planned economy.

Thanks to the fraternal and multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union, the economy of the Romanian People's Republic had already reached the pre-war production level of 1938 as early as 1948. During the period of implementing the first two-year plan (1949 and 1950), industrial production doubled the production volume of 1948.

Upon completion of the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), industrial production will be 2.44 times that of 1950. Simultaneously with the work of implementing Romania's first Five-Year Plan, the massive work of the electrification plan has also begun. According to the provisions of the electrification plan, in the next ten years, the total power generation capacity of the country will triple the total power generation capacity of the bourgeoisie in the past sixty years.

Due to the many achievements in production, the living standards of workers have also improved. For example, the average wage in the industrial sector increased by 30 percent in 1949; upon completion of the Five-Year Plan, the living standards of workers will increase by 80 percent compared to 1950.

There are many huge construction projects: the Danube-Black Sea Canal, the "Mars Mansion" printing factory, the "Lenin" hydroelectric center in the Begaz region, the chemical coking plant in Hengnidola, and many other projects.

In the struggle to build new industries, the attitude of workers and technicians towards labor has greatly improved. More and more workers are participating in socialist labor competitions. The movement of advanced workers and Stakhanovite workers is becoming more and more widespread.

Agriculture is also advancing along the socialist road. The state provides farmers with more machinery and agricultural implements in the form of machine and tractor stations. State farms also help working farmers use advanced agricultural production methods.

Countless poor and middle peasants have gradually realized the good achievements of collective labor using advanced agricultural technology methods, merged their land, and formed collective farms.

By the completion of the Five-Year Plan, agriculture will receive tens of thousands of new tractors, harvesters, threshers, and seeders manufactured in the country.

The cultural level of the Romanian working people has also rapidly improved. The number of secondary schools is now 80 percent higher than in 1938. In the 153 departments of higher education institutions across the country, there are a total of 54,000 students, while in 1938, there were only 26,500 students in 41 departments. The circulation of books and newspapers has greatly increased. In 1950, a total of 60.52 million books were published, four times more than in 1938.

The Romanian people are creating a free and happy life for themselves. That is why they love peace. They universally voted in favor of peace. More than 11 million men and women have signed the declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

The Romanian people are resolutely defending their new life against all those who attempt to hinder their progress. The Romanian people, freed from the enslavement of imperialism and the bourgeoisie-landlord clique, are determined to strike at all conspiracies by imperialism to undermine their country.

The working people of the Romanian People's Republic are working with unwavering confidence for a happy future. They know that the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, with the participation of the great Chinese people and the people of other people's democratic countries, is an unconquerable fortress that is resisting the evil clutches of US-British imperialists and guaranteeing the lives of children, family happiness, and peaceful and constructive labor.

In celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic, the Romanian people are determined to enthusiastically labor to achieve socialism in Romania, and to strengthen the national defense forces and thereby strengthen the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is fighting for peace.

    罗马尼亚人民共和国成立四周年
    罗马尼亚人民在今年十二月三十日庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国成立四周年。四年以前，在工人阶级的政党领导下的劳动人民，推翻了作为帝国主义的代理人和反动势力最后堡垒的君主政体，建立了新型的国家——罗马尼亚人民共和国——一个属于劳动人民的国家，它的政权属于和劳动农民结成联盟的工人阶级。
    推翻了君主政体，为罗马尼亚的劳动人民打开了建立一个强盛、自由和独立的人民共和国的道路，打开了建设社会主义的光荣道路。
    过去四年中，在罗马尼亚发生了重要的政治、经济和社会的变化。现在，政权属于劳动人民。各级人民会议代替了旧有的政权机构，它的十一万以上的成员来自劳动人民的各个阶层。通过人民会议，劳动人民的广大群众参加了管理国家事务的工作。
    罗马尼亚人民已经获得了最高的自由和权利，民族的独立，作为国家主人的权利，和享受他的劳动成果的权利。整个国家现在已经变成为一个进行和平建设的巨大建筑现场。
    主要生产手段的收归国有，为实行计划经济创造了必要的条件。
    由于苏联的兄弟般的和多方面的援助，罗马尼亚人民共和国的经济，早在一九四八年时就已达到了战前一九三八年的生产水平。在实行第一个二年的计划经济时期（一九四九年和一九五○年），工业生产量已两倍于一九四八年的生产量了。
    在五年计划（一九五一年——一九五五年）完成时，工业生产量将为一九五○年的二点四四倍。与进行罗马尼亚第一个五年计划的工作同时，电气化计划的巨大工作也已开始。按照电气化计划的规定，在今后十年内，全国电力的总发电量将三倍于资产阶级过去六十年来所有的总发电量。
    由于生产上获得了许多成就，工人的生活水平也提高了。例如，工业部门的平均工资在一九四九年增加了百分之三十；在五年计划完成时，工人的生活水平将较一九五○年提高百分之八十。
    巨大的建设工程是很多的：多瑙河——黑海运河、“火星大厦”印刷厂、卑加兹地方的“列宁”水电中心、恒尼多拉的化学炼焦厂与其他许多工程。
    在为建设新的工业的斗争中，工人和技术人员对劳动的态度是大大的进步了。愈来愈多的工人群众参加了社会主义的劳动竞赛。先进工人和斯塔哈诺夫式工作者的运动是愈来愈广泛了。
    农业也沿着社会主义的道路前进。国家用机器与拖拉机站的方式，供给农民更多的机器和农具。国营农场还帮助劳动农民使用先进的农业生产方法。
    无数的贫农和中农，逐渐认识到采用先进农业技术方法的集体劳作所获得的良好成就，合并了他们的土地，组成了集体农场。
    到五年计划完成时，农业将获得在本国制造的成万辆新的拖拉机、收割机、打禾机和播种机。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民的文化水平也迅速地提高了。现在中等学校的数目比一九三八年增加了百分之八十。在全国高等学校一百五十三个科系中，共有五万四千名学生，而在一九三八年的时候，四十一个科系中只有两万六千五百名学生。书籍报纸的流通量已经大为增加。在一九五○年，共出版了六千零五十二万册的书籍，较一九三八年增加了四倍。
    罗马尼亚人民正在为他们自己创造着一个自由与幸福的生活。这就是他们为什么热爱和平的原因。他们普遍投票拥护和平。一千一百万以上的男子和妇女已在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。
    罗马尼亚人民坚决地保卫他们的新生活，反对所有企图阻挠他们前进的人们。挣脱了帝国主义和资产阶级——大地主集团奴役的罗马尼亚人民，决心打击帝国主义破坏他们国家的一切阴谋。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民，怀着坚定不移的信心为幸福的将来而工作。他们知道，以苏联为首的、有伟大中国人民以及其他人民民主国家的人民共同参加的和平阵营，是一个不可征服的堡垒，它正在反对着美英帝国主义者的罪恶魔手，保障着儿童的生活、家庭的愉快、幸福和和平的建设性劳动。
    在庆祝罗马尼亚人民共和国成立四周年的时候，罗马尼亚人民决心要热情地为争取在罗马尼亚实现社会主义而劳动，为加强国防力量并因此而加强为和平而斗争的以苏联为首的民主阵营而努力。
