Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Paris "Ce Soir" reporter Bertrand reported from Panmunjom on the 29th: The Korean-Chinese representatives raised several sharp questions this morning regarding the "reasons" for points 3 and 4 of the American side's proposal on the third agenda item. After Joye stated that he could not answer these questions, the meeting was adjourned at 12:30 noon until the morning of the 30th. The Korean-Chinese representatives asked Joye to explain: How can maintaining the military status quo only in a state of war prevent the recurrence of hostile actions? Joye could not give a proper answer. General Nam Il stated that the concentration of troops and supplies is not the policy of the Korean-Chinese side. Even maintaining the current level of military strength is not the policy of the Korean-Chinese side. The policy of the Korean-Chinese side is to reduce the level of military strength. The Korean-Chinese side suggested discussing the complete withdrawal of foreign troops at the beginning of the negotiations for this reason. However, the American side was unwilling to discuss this issue, and for the sake of achieving an armistice as soon as possible, the Korean-Chinese side agreed to include this issue in the fifth agenda item. General Nam Il told Joye: "The Korean-Chinese side does not believe that both sides should continue to concentrate troops. On the contrary, we believe that foreign troops and their equipment must be withdrawn in order to truly reduce the military forces and supplies in Korea." General Nam Il pointed out that the five-point proposal of the Korean-Chinese side can fully and reasonably guarantee the armistice. Joye believes that he has the right to discuss the increase or decrease of military forces and supplies, but has no right to discuss the withdrawal or stationing of troops. The Korean-Chinese side exposed the contradiction in Joye's attitude. Joye wants to discuss measures to prevent the recurrence of hostile acts, but does not discuss this issue in conjunction with the issue of troop withdrawal. The Korean-Chinese side directly questioned Joye: "Do you want to reduce your troops?" Joye panicked and could not answer.

    我方在前天谈判中提出质问
    乔埃心慌意乱表示无法答复
    【新华社三十日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌二十九日自板门店报道：朝中代表今天上午就美方关于第三项议程的建议的第三点和第四点的“理由”，提出若干尖锐的问题。在乔埃表明他对这些问题不能回答之后，会议即在十二时三十分宣布休会到三十日上午。朝中代表要求乔埃说明：仅仅在战争状态中保持军事现状怎么可能防止敌对行动的再起？乔埃不能作出确当的回答。南日将军表明，集结部队与供应品不是朝中方面的政策。甚至维持军事力量的现有水平也不是朝中方面的政策。朝中方面的政策是要降低军事力量的水平。朝中方面在谈判开始时建议讨论完全撤退外国军队问题，就是因为这个缘故。但美方不愿讨论这一问题，为早日获致停战计，朝中方面同意将这一问题列入议程第五项。南日将军告诉乔埃说：“朝中方面不以为双方应继续集结部队。相反地，我们认为必须撤退外国军队及其装备，以便真正地减少朝鲜境内的军事部队与供应品。”南日将军指出，朝中方面的五点建议可以充分而合理地使停战得到保障。乔埃认为他有权讨论增加或减少军事部队与供应品的问题，但无权讨论撤退或留驻部队问题。朝中方面揭露了乔埃这种态度中的矛盾。乔埃要讨论防止敌对行为再起的措施，但却不把这一问题与撤退军队问题一并讨论。朝中方面直截了当地质问乔埃：“你究竟要不要减少你们的部队？”乔埃心慌意乱，无法答复。
