    Laiyang Prefecture Changshandao Special Zone Grain Depot
    Serious Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres
    Results in Large-Scale Grain Spoilage
    Editor: The grain depot in Changshandao Special Zone, Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, has experienced large-scale grain spoilage due to the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres and their failure to conduct thorough inspections.
    The Dakoudong Village branch warehouse of the Tuoji Island Grain Depot in Changshandao Special Zone stored more than 59,000 jin of corn in 1950. Because the collected grain contained too much moisture and was not regularly sun-dried after being put into the warehouse, it was very susceptible to spoilage. In late August of this year, the warehouse keeper, Comrade Li Qiming, discovered that the grain in the warehouse was heating up and reported it to the director of the Special Zone Grain Depot. The director of the Special Zone Grain Depot, Gao Xiquan, did not pay attention to this matter. It wasn't until early September when it rained continuously and the warehouse leaked that the Special Zone Grain Depot director sent someone to inspect, but more than 1,100 jin of grain had already rotted, and the remaining 57,000 jin had also deteriorated and discolored, making it inedible. After learning about this situation, the Laiyang Prefectural Grain Bureau sent personnel to conduct a general inspection and discovered that more than 600 jin of the 45,000 jin of corn stored in the Moshizui Village branch warehouse on Tuoji Island had rotted, and the remaining 40,000 jin had also developed a strange taste and deteriorated. Relevant authorities are now investigating and handling these incidents.
    We suggest that comrades in charge of grain storage learn from this lesson to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    莱阳专区长山岛特区粮库
    领导干部官僚主义作风严重
    造成霉烂大批粮食的事件
    编辑同志：山东省莱阳专区长山岛特区的粮库，由于领导干部有官僚主义作风，不深入检查，造成大批霉粮事件。
    长山岛特区粮库砣矶岛大口东村分仓，在一九五○年收储苞米五万九千多斤，因征收的粮食含水分过多，入仓后又没有经常曝晒，因此很容易霉坏。今年八月下旬，这个仓库的保管员李启明同志发现仓里粮食发热，就汇报给特区粮库主任。特区粮库主任高锡泉对这件事竟没有重视。直到九月上旬阴雨连绵，仓房漏水，区粮库主任才派人检查，但粮食已霉烂一千一百多斤，其余五万七千多斤也已经变质变色不能食用。莱阳专署粮食局了解这一情况后，就派员前往进行普遍检查，又发现砣矶岛磨石咀村分仓储藏的苞米四万五千多斤已霉烂六百多斤，其余四万多斤也都生味变质。现在有关机关，正检查处理这些事件。
    我们建议保管粮食的同志，接受这个教训，防止今后再发生类似事件。    　王树泉　马　骥
