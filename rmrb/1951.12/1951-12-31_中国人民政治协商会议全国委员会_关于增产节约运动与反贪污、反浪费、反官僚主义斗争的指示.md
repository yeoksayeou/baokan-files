To the Provincial and Municipal Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Continuing to strengthen the resistance against America and aid to Korea, advocating and promoting increased production and practicing economy, and promoting ideological remolding and study are the central political tasks of this conference at present. Instructions on the movement to increase production and practice economy and the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism are hereby issued as follows.

The slogan of "Increase production and practice strict economy," put forward under the current objective situation, has very significant meaning. At present, our country, on the one hand, shoulders the sacred task of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending the Far East and world peace, and on the other hand, must carry out arduous economic, cultural, and educational construction tasks on the basis of the original backwardness. The movement to increase production and practice economy was proposed to meet the needs of carrying out these two great historical tasks. The unfolding of this movement will inevitably enhance the strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people in winning the victory of the anti-aggression war, and will also inevitably accumulate national wealth and create the necessary conditions for industrialization.

National industrialization must accumulate funds. However, our method of accumulating funds cannot adopt the predatory methods used by capitalist countries, such as plundering colonies or obtaining "reparations" through wars of aggression. Basically, we can only rely on the internal strength of the people, which depends on the movement to increase production and practice economy. In this regard, the socialist construction of the Soviet Union has provided us with valuable experience. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy is by no means a measure to solve temporary difficulties, but a policy of constant importance related to national construction. We must promote it as a long-term, mass movement.

The promotion of the movement to increase production and practice economy must be closely integrated with the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism. Corruption and waste are the great enemies of increasing production and practicing economy. Their harm to the interests of the country and the people has developed to a considerably serious degree. If this serious phenomenon is not curbed and overcome, it will corrupt our newborn state organs. Bureaucratism is precisely the hotbed of corruption and waste. Wherever corruption and waste are most serious, bureaucratism is bound to be most serious. Therefore, without resolutely launching the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism, the movement to increase production and practice economy cannot be carried out smoothly. This struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism is precisely to pave the way for increasing production and practicing economy.

At present, governments at all levels are vigorously and swiftly launching the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism. Local consultative bodies must vigorously assist this movement through various democratic parties and people's organizations; it is necessary to develop this movement among the masses of all social strata, rely on the masses, assist the government, and boldly expose corruption and waste. At the same time, the masses should be mobilized to ruthlessly expose the criminal behavior of certain unscrupulous merchants who bribe working cadres and steal state wealth, thoroughly eliminate this decadent and selfish style of the exploiting class, eliminate the influence of all reactionary Kuomintang styles, and establish a new democratic social atmosphere to clear the way for the development of national construction.

It is hoped that after receiving this notice, all localities will assist in promoting this movement in a planned and step-by-step manner in accordance with the specific local conditions, and will report the work situation to the conference at any time.

    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会
    关于增产节约运动与反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的指示各省、市协商委员会：继续加强抗美援朝，提倡和推动增产节约，以及推动思想改造学习等三项工作，是本会当前的中心政治任务。兹就增产节约运动与反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争提出如下的指示。“增加生产，厉行节约”的号召，在今天这一客观形势下提出来，是有其非常重大的意义的。目前我们的国家，一方面担负抗美援朝及保卫远东与世界和平的神圣任务，同时又须在原有落后的基础上进行繁重的经济、文教建设任务。增产节约的运动就是为执行这两个伟大的历史任务的需要而被提出的。这一运动的展开，必然可以增强支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民的力量，以获得反侵略战争的胜利，同时也必然会积累国家财富，为工业化创造必要的条件。国家工业化，必须积累资金。而我们积累资金的方法，不能采用资本主义国家所用的掠夺殖民地或通过侵略战争取得的“赔款”等等强盗式的方法，基本地只能依靠人民内部的力量，这就有赖于增产节约运动。在这一方面，苏联社会主义的建设，已为我们提供了宝贵的经验。因此，增产节约决不是解决临时困难的措施，而是关系国家建设的有经常重要性的政策。我们必须把它作为一个持久的、群众性的运动来推动。推动增产节约运动，必须与反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争密切相结合。贪污、浪费是增产节约的大敌，它对于国家与人民利益的危害，已发展到相当严重的程度。如果对这种严重现象不加以制止和克服，就会腐蚀我们新生的国家机构。而官僚主义正是贪污与浪费的温床，凡是贪污浪费最严重的地方，必然是官僚主义最严重的地方。因此，不坚决地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，增产节约运动就不能顺利展开。这一反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，正是为增产节约铺平道路。目前各级政府正在大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。各地协商机关必须通过各民主党派、各人民团体，大力地协助这一运动；要把这一运动发展到社会各阶层群众中，依靠群众，协助政府，大胆地检举贪污浪费，同时也应发动群众，无情地揭发某些奸商贿赂工作干部、盗取国家财富的犯罪行为，彻底地肃清这种腐朽的剥削阶级损人利己的作风，肃清一切反动的国民党作风的影响，树立新民主主义的社会风气，为国家建设事业的发展扫清道路。希望各地接到这一通告后，按照当地具体情况，有计划、有步骤地来协助推动这一运动，并盼将工作情形随时报告本会。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会一九五一年十二月二十九日
