    The Savings System in Soviet Industrial Production
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

    Once, we were visiting the Serbakov Silk Weaving Factory in Moscow. When we reached the looms, the chief engineer of the textile factory asked a female worker to show us how to join broken threads. The worker quickly joined the thread at the break and removed the excess thread, which was less than an inch long, after joining. The chief engineer immediately picked up this thread from the floor and seriously criticized the worker, saying that the removed thread was too long. He then explained the principle of accumulating small savings and told the worker to pay attention to conservation. This incident left a deep impression on us, making us realize that even an inch of thread involves a matter of principle, and it also drew my attention to the Soviet system of conservation.

    Workers in Soviet economic enterprises, especially those in charge, regard conservation as a constant system to be observed at all times. This is the principle indicated by the great Stalin. As early as April 1926, when the Soviet Union was embarking on industrial construction, Stalin and Kuibyshev, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party, issued a letter to the whole party "On the Struggle for the Savings System." The letter emphasized: "In our situation where equipment is lacking, we must reduce all non-essential and dispensable expenses to the maximum extent, save every kopeck, and systematically accumulate funds for the needs of our industry." "The struggle for the savings system should become the cause of all leaders and managers of economic organs, especially all Communist Party members working in economic organs."

    Conservation is one of the fundamental methods by which the Soviet people manage enterprises

    Over the years, the Soviet people have established a savings system based on this principle. They regard the savings system as one of the fundamental methods for correctly operating and managing production enterprises. During the period of Soviet industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the savings system played a huge role in ensuring the accumulation of funds and ensuring the proper use of funds. During the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union, the savings system ensured an uninterrupted supply to the front lines; for example, although many factories, mines, and power stations fell into enemy hands at that time, the Soviet industry was still able to save millions of tons of iron, hundreds of thousands of tons of non-ferrous metals, and billions of kilowatt-hours of electricity by fully leveraging the power of every inch of iron, every piece of coal, and every unit of electricity. After the war, the Soviet Union attached even greater importance to the savings system in developing the national economy and intensifying communist construction. Various forms of savings competition movements emerged in production.

    When collectives or individuals on the Soviet production front look for possibilities for savings, they always pay special attention to raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity. Because these materials are the main components of the cost of industrial products: they account for an average of 70 percent of the cost (lower in the machinery manufacturing sector and higher in the metallurgical, chemical, logging, tanning, textile, food, and other industrial sectors). Therefore, the rational use of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, in order to reduce the consumption of these materials in each product, can reduce the cost of products and increase the accumulation of funds. People still cherish and adhere to the nationwide savings movement initiated successively by female worker Rozhnieva of the Kubavin Fine Fleece Factory in Moscow and female worker Kolabelnikova of the "Paris Commune" Shoe Factory in Moscow—a movement for comprehensive savings of materials and the production of surplus products with the saved materials. As a result of promoting this comprehensive savings movement, Soviet textile workers over-fulfilled the plan in 1950 by producing 24 million meters of cotton and linen fabrics, 3.25 million meters of woolen fabrics, and more than one million meters of silk fabrics; 153 Soviet shoe, fur, and felt enterprises over-produced 2.5 million pairs of leather shoes, 188,000 pairs of felt shoes, and many fur goods in 1950. This is the result of saving every inch of thread and every inch of leather. After the start of the great communist construction projects, the workers of the Kharkov Transportation Machinery Manufacturing Factory proposed a competition to save metal and materials to increase funds for the great communist construction projects. In the first quarter of 1951, they saved 110 tons of pig iron, 187 tons of heavy oil, 25 tons of gasoline, and about 20 tons of volatile oil. The total power generation in the Soviet Union in 1951 reached as high as 104 billion kilowatt-hours. The widespread use of electricity in industry makes saving electricity of great significance. In the first ten months of 1951, industrial and transportation enterprises in Moscow saved more than 182.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity; the electricity saved is enough to produce one million tons of steel, or 364 million pairs of leather shoes, or two billion meters of cloth.

    Cherishing existing equipment, reducing equipment repairs or downtime, extending the service life of equipment, and leveraging the potential of equipment – this is another aspect of the savings that Soviet Stakhanovite workers pay attention to. The movement initiated by female worker Nacharova of the Ural Automobile Factory to better protect equipment is still being promoted. At the beginning of 1951, 73 percent of the equipment in the First Ball Bearing Manufacturing Factory in Moscow and 68 percent of the equipment in the Leningrad Carburetor Factory adopted a responsible protection system. The Kharkov Tractor Manufacturing Factory's advanced workers are now promoting a competition in the Soviet machinery manufacturing industry - saving and effectively utilizing tools by repairing discarded tools many times. The rationalization proposers of this factory once organized mixed groups to solve technical problems in repairing and utilizing discarded tools. Repairing discarded tools enabled this factory to save 1.5 million rubles on tools in five months of 1951 and save eight tons of steel used to manufacture tools. The Soviet machinery manufacturing industry has made such rapid progress (more than 400 new types of machines and equipment were manufactured in 1951 alone), and still pays attention to savings; this fully demonstrates the responsible attitude and serious spirit adopted by workers toward state property in the Soviet Union, where the means of production are owned by society.

    Reducing product costs occupies an important position in the savings system

    In the Soviet savings system, the movement to reduce product costs occupies an important position. We know that the cost of each product is composed of the raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity, equipment depreciation, workers' wages, and factory administrative expenses spent in producing it. Therefore, reducing product costs is a concentrated manifestation of savings in various production indicators. To reduce product costs, we must strive to reduce the consumption of materials and labor, increase labor productivity, reduce defective products, improve quality, and improve the operation and management of enterprises. The lower the cost of the product, the higher the profit of the enterprise, and the faster the accumulation of funds. The movement to reduce product costs has a direct impact on increasing production and expanding reproduction.

    In 1948, the Soviet Union saw a movement to strive for surplus accumulation. Originally, the Soviet factory director's fund was composed of enterprise profits and state bonuses. In December 1946, the Soviet Council of Ministers made a decision, pointing out that the source of the factory director's fund "is enterprise profits, and for enterprises that do not obtain profits according to the plan, it comes from savings in reducing product costs." This decision prompted many enterprises to improve their operation and management. At the beginning of 1948, nine factories in Moscow initiated a movement to give up state bonuses and increase accumulation by saving expenses and reducing costs. In August of that year, the movement to strive for surplus accumulation became popular throughout the country. At the end of that year, the increased unplanned profits reached 6 billion rubles.

    At the beginning of 1951, the Rostov "Proletarian Hammer" factory conducted a comprehensive unplanned competition to reduce product costs. Workers strived to save in all aspects that constitute product costs, such as wages, materials, electricity, steam, water, equipment protection and small repairs, tool consumption, and transportation expenses; for example: one defective product inspector did the work of two inspectors; the distribution of machine oil was managed by one worker concurrently; partial repairs of machines were done by the production teams themselves; a responsible protection system was implemented for machine tools to reduce repair costs; materials were cut more economically; even work clothes were saved by repairing and wearing them again. As a result of implementing savings in all aspects, large and small, this factory will save more than one million rubles for the country in 1951. At the suggestion of the Central Committee of the Soviet Local Industry Trade Union, 129 enterprises in the Russian Federation's local industry have promoted this competition. In the first quarter of 1951, they reduced costs by 15 million rubles.

    In its resolution at the Sixth Plenary Session in July 1951, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions pointed out that reducing product costs as much as possible is one of the main tasks of the current competition. Since then, the movement to reduce product costs has become more active. The movement initiated by Levkinaka and Mukhanov of the Moscow "Petrel" Shoe Factory in August 1951 to reduce product costs in every operation continues to be promoted throughout the Soviet Union. The division of labor in machine production is very detailed. The production of each pair of shoes in the "Petrel" Shoe Factory requires 130 different operations. The competition to reduce product costs in each operation enables workers to analyze and understand the specific content of product costs in their own operations, thereby actively striving to save raw materials, materials, and electricity in their own operations, better use machines and tools, and improve product quality. This is a concrete guarantee for the movement to reduce product costs. This movement has produced amazing results. Taking the "Petrel" Shoe Factory as an example, in the three months from August to October when the competition was conducted, it saved a total of 1,887,000 square decimeters of face leather and more than 14 tons of rawhide, and used these materials to manufacture 78,000 pairs of leather shoes; due to over-fulfilling the reduction of costs, the increase in revenue reached 1,625,000 rubles; labor productivity increased by 6.9 percent, and the production plan was completed by 106.7 percent; in the third quarter competition, it won the Red Banner of Excellence from the Soviet Council of Ministers. These achievements are only preliminary achievements.

    In the Soviet Union, reducing product costs is not only an important source of increasing the accumulation of the national economy, but also an important condition for reducing prices. The achievements made by the Soviet people's labor enthusiasm in reducing product costs after the war have created favorable conditions for four price reductions, that is, for improving their living standards. And reducing prices and improving living standards in turn have prompted the people's labor enthusiasm to increase further, and product costs to be further reduced. This is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the socialist economic system. In 1951, the Soviet plan to reduce product costs will be over-fulfilled again, and the funds saved in the industrial sector alone will reach 26 billion rubles.

    Economic accounting can ensure the implementation of the savings system

    The Soviet savings system is guaranteed by economic accounting. Soviet factories and mines widely promote economic accounting for factories and mines, workshops, sections, and production teams. The purpose of economic accounting is to reduce costs and increase profits. Implementing economic accounting is the only way to statistically calculate, not estimate, the accurate figures of costs. Now, the competition for personal economic accounting is being promoted in Soviet enterprises. Personal economic accounting enables collectives and individuals to clearly know the situation of savings or waste, thereby more deeply understanding the necessity of savings and how to save. The initiator of personal economic accounting, Peter Chaik, a steelmaking worker at the Upper Isetsk Factory, saved materials and electricity worth 186,000 rubles in 1950. All steelmaking workers in the factory saved 2.25 million rubles in 1950 due to the implementation of personal economic accounting.

    苏联工业生产中的节约制度
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李何
    有一次，我们在莫斯科谢尔巴科夫丝织厂参观，当我们走到织布机跟前的时候，纺织厂的总工程师请女工接线头给我们看。女工在断线地方迅速地接了线，摘掉了接线后多余的不到一寸的线头。总工程师马上从地上拣起这根线头，严肃地批评了女工，说摘掉的线头太长了，并且向女工解释了积少成多的道理，叫女工注意节约。这件事留给我们深刻的印象，使我们认识到了一寸线头包含有原则问题，同时也引起我对苏联节约制度的注意。
    苏联经济企业的工作人员，尤其是主管人员，把节约看作时刻要遵守的经常的制度。这是伟大的斯大林所指示的原则。远在一九二六年四月，当苏联走向工业化大建设的时候，斯大林和古比雪夫代表布尔什维克党中央向全党发出一封“关于为节约制度而作的斗争”的信，信里强调指出：“在我们缺乏设备的情形下，最大限度地减缩一切非绝对必需的以及没有也过得去的开支，储蓄每一个小戈贝克，为我们工业的需要有系统地积累资金。”“为节约制度所作的斗争，应当成为经济机关的一切领导者和管理者的事业，尤其是在经济机关工作的一切共产党员的事业。”
    节约是苏联人民管理企业的根本方法之一
    多年来，苏联人民根据这个原则建立了节约制度，他们把节约制度当作正确地经营、管理生产企业的根本方法之一。在苏联进行国家工业化和农业集体化时期，节约制度在保证积累资金和保证资金的正当用途方面起了巨大的作用。在苏联进行伟大的卫国战争时期，节约制度保证了对前线的源源不绝的供给；例如，当时虽然许多厂、矿、电力站沦入敌手，但是由于充分地发挥每一寸铁、每一块煤、每一度电的力量，苏联工业仍能节省了几百万吨铁、几十万吨有色金属和几十亿瓩时电力。战后，苏联在发展国民经济和加紧共产主义建设当中，更加重视节约制度。在生产中出现了各种形式的节约竞赛运动。
    苏联生产战线上的集体或个人，在寻找节约的可能性时，总是特别注意原料、材料、燃料和电力。因为这些资料是工业产品成本的主要成分：它们平均占成本的百分之七十（在机器制造业部门低些，在冶金、化学、伐木、制革、纺织、食品等工业部门高些）。因此，合理地使用原料、材料、燃料和电力，以减低这些资料在每一件产品上的耗费，就能够使得产品成本降低和资金积累增高。人们至今还珍重和坚持着莫斯科库巴维因细绒厂女工罗日聂娃和莫斯科“巴黎公社”制鞋厂女工科拉贝尔尼科娃所先后发起的全国规模的节约运动——全盘节约材料并且用节约下来的材料生产超额产品的运动。由于推行这个全盘节约运动，苏联纺织工业工人在一九五零年超计划出产了二千四百万公尺的棉织品和麻织品，三百二十五万公尺的毛织品，百余万公尺的丝织品；苏联一百五十三个制鞋、制毛皮、制毡企业在一九五零年额外出产了二百五十万双皮鞋、十八万八千双毡鞋和许多毛皮货。这就是节约每一寸线、每一寸皮的结果。伟大的共产主义建设工程开始以后，哈尔科夫运输机器制造厂的工人提出了为增加伟大共产主义建设工程的资金而节约金属和材料的竞赛。他们在一九五一年第一季节约了一百一十吨生铁、一百八十七吨重油、二十五吨汽油、约二十吨挥发油。苏联一九五一年总发电量高达一千零四十亿瓩时，工业上广泛地使用电力，因此节约电力有巨大的意义。莫斯科的工业和运输企业一九五一年头十个月就节约了一亿八千二百万瓩时以上的电力；利用节约下的这些电力，足够生产一百万吨钢，或者三亿六千四百万双皮鞋，或者二十亿公尺布。
    爱护现有的装备、减少装备的修理或停顿、延长装备的使用期限、发挥装备的潜在能力——这是苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工作者所注意的节约的另一方面。乌拉尔汽车工厂女工纳查罗娃所发起的更好地保护装备的运动，还在推广。一九五一年初，莫斯科第一球轴承制造厂百分之七十三的装备，列宁格勒碳化器工厂百分之六十八的装备都采取了负责保护制。现在苏联机器制造业中正在推广哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂先进工人所发起的竞赛——用多次修复废置工具的办法，来节约地和有效地利用工具。这个工厂的合理化建议者曾经组织了混合组，以解决修复和利用废置工具中的技术问题。修复废置工具，使这个工厂在一九五一年五个月中在工具上节约了
    一百五十万卢布，并且节省了八吨制造工具用的钢。苏联机器制造业那样突飞猛进（仅在一九五一年就制造出四百多种新式的机器和装备），还这样讲求节约；这充分表现了在生产资料归社会所有的苏联，工人对于国家财产所采取的负责的态度和认真的精神。
    减低产品成本在节约制度中占有重要地位
    在苏联节约制度中，减低产品成本的运动占有重要地位。我们知道，每件产品的成本，是由生产它时所花费的原料、材料、燃料、电力、装备的折旧、工人的工资，以及工厂的行政开销等构成的。因此，减低产品成本是生产中各个指标节约的集中表现。要减低产品成本，就必须努力减低物资和劳动的消耗，提高劳动生产率，减少废品，提高质量，改进企业的经营和管理。产品的成本愈低，企业的利润就愈高，资金的积累就愈快。减低产品成本的运动对于提高生产和扩大再生产，是有直接影响的。
    一九四八年苏联曾出现了争取超额积累的运动。本来苏联的厂长基金是由企业利润和国家奖金组成的。一九四六年十二月苏联部长会议作出了决定，指出厂长基金的来源“是企业利润，而在按照计划得不到利润的企业，则从减低产品成本中节约”。这个决定促使许多企业改善它们的经营管理。一九四八年初，莫斯科九个工厂发起了放弃国家奖金的运动，用节省开支减低成本的办法来增加积累。当年八月，争取超额积累的运动普及到了全国。当年年底，增加的超计划的利润达到六十亿卢布。
    一九五一年初，罗斯多夫“无产者铁锤”工厂进行了全盘超计划减低产品成本的竞赛。工人们在工资、材料、电力、蒸气、水、装备的保护和小修理、工具的耗损、运输的费用等构成产品成本的各方面力求节约；例如：一个废品检查员做两个检查员的工作；机器油的分配由一个工人兼管；机器的部分修理由各生产组自己动手；对机床实行负责保护制以减少修理费；更经济地切裁材料；甚至于节约到把工作服修补再穿。由于大大小小各方面实行节约的结果，这一个工厂一九五一年将为国家节省一百多万卢布。在苏联地方工业工会中央委员会的提议之下，俄罗斯联邦地方工业已有一百二十九个企业推行这个竞赛。一九五一年第一季，它们减低了成本一千五百万卢布。
    全苏工会中央理事会在一九五一年七月第六届全体会议的决议中曾经指出尽量减低产品成本，是目前竞赛的主要任务之一。从这以后，减低产品成本的运动更形活跃。一九五一年八月莫斯科“海燕”皮鞋厂列甫秦卡和穆哈诺夫所发起的在每一个操作上减低产品成本的运动，继续在全苏联推广着。机器生产的分工是非常细密的。“海燕”皮鞋厂出产每一双鞋，要经过一百三十道不同的操作。在每一个操作上减低产品成本的竞赛，使工人分析和明白自己操作上产品成本的具体内容，从而积极地在自己的操作上力求节约原料、材料、电力，更好地使用机器和工具，提高产品质量。这是具体保证减低产品成本的运动。这个运动已经产生了惊人的成绩，拿“海燕”皮鞋厂来说，从八月到十月进行竞赛的三个月间，它总共节约了一百八十八万七千平方公寸面子皮和十四吨以上粗皮，用这些材料制造了七万八千双皮鞋；由于超额减低成本，增加收入达一百六十二万五千卢布；劳动生产率提高百分之六·九，生产计划完成百分之一零六·七；在第三季竞赛中获得了苏联部长会议的优胜红旗。这些成绩还只是初步的成绩。
    在苏联，减低产品成本不仅是增加国民经济积累的一个重要来源，而且是减低物价的一个重要条件。战后苏联人民劳动热情所取得的减低产品成本的成绩，为四次减低物价也就是为提高自己生活水平造成了便利的条件。而减低物价和提高生活水平反过来又促使人民劳动热情更加提高，产品成本更加减低。这就是社会主义经济制度优越性的一个具体表现。一九五一年苏联减低产品成本的计划又将超额完成，单在工业方面节约的资金就将达二百六十亿卢布。
    经济核算能保证节约制度贯彻执行
    苏联节约制度是靠经济核算来保证的。苏联厂矿广泛推行着厂矿、车间、分段、生产组的经济核算。经济核算的目的就是要减低成本和提高利润。实行经济核算，才能统计出，不是估计出，成本的准确数字。现在，苏联企业中正在推广着个人经济核算的竞赛。个人经济核算，使集体和个人清楚地知道节约或浪费的情形，因而更深刻地认识节约的必要和如何节约。个人经济核算的发起人，上伊设茨克工厂炼钢工人彼得·查伊克在一九五零年节约了值十八万六千卢布的材料和电力。全厂炼钢工人由于实行个人经济核算一九五零年节约了二百二十五万卢布。
