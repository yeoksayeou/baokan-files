Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th. Since our delegation to the Korean armistice talks suggested on the 3rd that both sides refrain from introducing military forces and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea during the armistice period, and suggested the establishment of a neutral nations supervisory organization, the other side has consistently refused to express an attitude. At the subcommittee meeting on the 6th, the other side not only continued to refuse to express any attitude towards our suggestions, but instead demanded that the subcommittee discuss the absurd and unreasonable suggestions put forward by the other side on November 27, allowing the continued introduction of armed forces and personnel, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under the pretext of rotation and replenishment, and allowing the other side to freely enter and exit the entire territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to conduct ground, sea, and air inspections. The other side also put forward a new additional suggestion that the so-called supervisory organization composed of the belligerent parties "shall not become effective until the armistice agreement has been organized, staffed, and prepared to begin performing its designated duties." Before the end of the meeting on the 6th, our representative pointed out: For three days, our side has answered in detail every question from the other side regarding our suggestions, but the other side has not expressed a single positive opinion on our suggestions, but instead put forward so-called formal schemes with no new opinions, resulting in a waste of three days, and the meeting has made no progress. Our representative once again requested that the other side express its attitude towards our suggestions at the subcommittee meeting on the 7th, so as to start a beneficial discussion.

    美方对我方建议始终不表示意见继续浪费时间
    我方再次要美方对我建议表示态度
    【新华社开城六日电】自从朝鲜停战谈判我方代表在三日建议双方在停战期间，不自朝鲜境外运进军事力量与武器、弹药，并建议成立中立国监察机构后，对方始终拒绝表示态度。六日的小组委员会上，对方不但继续拒绝对我方建议表示任何态度，更反而要求小组委员会讨论对方在十一月二十七日所提出的荒谬无理的建议，允许在轮换与补充的藉口下，从朝鲜境外继续运入武装部队和人员与武器、弹药，并允许对方自由出入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全境进行地面、海上与空中的视察。对方并提出新的附加建议，由交战双方所组成的所谓监察机构“未经组织与配备工作人员并准备开始执行其指定职司之前，停战协议不得生效”。我方代表在六日会议结束前指出：三天以来我方已经详尽地答复了对方对于我方建议的每个问题，但对方对我方建议，却没有发表一句正面的意见，却竟提出所谓正式的、而毫无新的意见的方案，以致浪费了三天的时间，而会议毫无进展。我方代表再次要求对方在七日小组会上，对我方的建议表示态度，以便展开有益的讨论。
