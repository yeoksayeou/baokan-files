Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 18th: At the beginning of the Subcommittee on the Fourth Agenda of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on December 11th, our representative proposed the principle of the rapid release and repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice. However, the other side has consistently refused to express its attitude towards this completely reasonable principle, insisting on first exchanging POW materials and allowing the International Red Cross to visit our prisoner-of-war camps, resulting in no progress in the meetings for seven days. In order to break the deadlock and eliminate all pretexts of the other side, our representative suggested at the Subcommittee on the Fourth Agenda on the morning of the 18th that both sides exchange all POW materials in the afternoon to quickly enter into the discussion and decision on the principles proposed by our side. Our representative pointed out that an agreement on the negotiations on the Fourth Agenda is impossible with only the efforts of our side alone. The progress of the meeting will depend on whether the other side seeks new pretexts to refuse discussion and accept the absolutely fair and reasonable principles proposed by our side.

In the afternoon of the 18th, our side handed over to the other side all the materials of all enemy POWs as of the end of November, categorized by nationality, military number, rank, department, and location of the prisoner-of-war camp, and compiled in Korean and English according to the Rhee Syngman army and US, British, and other foreign troops respectively. However, the POW materials submitted by the other side were only names spelled out in English letters and did not include the items necessary for identification. Our representative immediately requested the other side to submit materials compiled in Korean and Chinese, as well as the rank and department of each prisoner of war. The other side agreed to submit the Korean and Chinese materials on December 25th but claimed that the rank and department of each prisoner of war could only be submitted after the 25th. The other side also requested a recess to study the materials and then notify the resumption date temporarily. Our representative pointed out that no materials were needed to discuss our principles, and since the prisoner materials had already been exchanged, there was no reason to delay the discussion any further. Our side agreed to the recess but hoped that the other side would notify the resumption as soon as possible so that the negotiations could progress quickly.

At the Subcommittee on the Third Agenda on the 18th, our representative pointed out that the main crux of the current negotiations is that the other side insists on interfering in our internal affairs, attempting to restrict our facilities in North Korea, and conducting inspections throughout North Korea. On the other hand, they insist on the right to import military forces and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea during the armistice period, that is, to maintain their so-called rotation and replenishment. Our representative questioned the other side on their opinion on how to break this crux. The other side arrogantly claimed that our side could consult the previous meeting records and asked our side to propose a new plan again. Our representative sternly pointed out that since the Third Agenda began to be discussed, our side has repeatedly made significant efforts. Because the other side insisted on conducting rear inspections, our side proposed the suggestion of neutral countries inspecting specific rear ports agreed upon by both sides; because the other side insisted on rotating armed personnel, our side also agreed to rotation within reasonable limits. The progress of the meeting requires joint efforts from both sides. If the other side insists on our side making unilateral concessions, the meeting will not be able to make any progress, and the responsibility for delaying the armistice negotiations will rest entirely with the other side.

    为打破第四项议程小组委员会僵局解除美方藉口
    我方代表提议双方交换全部战俘材料
    我方材料当日交出，美方材料极不完全竟借词休会
    【新华社开城十八日电】在十二月十一日的朝鲜停战谈判的第四项议程的小组委员会开始时，我方代表就提出了停战后迅速释放与遣送全部战俘的原则，但对方对于这一完全合理的原则，始终拒绝表示态度，坚持首先交换战俘的材料，以及由国际红十字会访问我俘虏营，以致七天以来会议毫无进展。为了打破僵局，解除对方一切藉口，我方代表在十八日上午的第四项议程的小组委员会上建议双方在下午交换全部战俘的材料，以便迅速进入对我方所提原则的讨论与决定。我方代表指出：只有我方单方的努力，关于第四项议程的谈判，是不可能达成协议的。会议的进展，将决定于对方是否另寻新的藉口拒绝讨论，并接受我方所提出的绝对公平合理的原则。
    十八日下午，我方将截至十一月底为止的全体对方战俘，分别国籍、军号、级别、部别及俘虏营的地点，并按照李伪军与美、英等外国军队分别用朝文与英文编制的全部资料交给对方，但对方所交出的战俘材料，却只是用英文字母拼出的姓名，更未包括识别时所必需的项目。我方代表当即要求对方补交以朝文与中文编制的材料，以及各个战俘的级别与部别。对方同意在十二月二十五日交出朝中文的材料，但声称：各个战俘的级别与部别须在二十五日以后始能交出。对方并要求休会研究资料，以后再临时通知复会日期。我方代表指出：讨论我方原则本不需要任何资料，俘虏资料既已交换，更再无拖延讨论之理，我方同意休会，但希望对方尽早通知复会，使谈判得以迅速进展。
    在十八日的第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表指出：目前谈判的主要症结是对方坚持干涉我方内政，企图限制我朝鲜境内的设备，并在朝鲜全境进行视察；而另一方面，对其自己却坚持有权在停战期内，自朝鲜境外输入军事力量与武器弹药，亦即保持其所谓轮换和补充。我方代表质问对方对于打开这个症结有何意见，对方却傲慢地声称：我方可以查阅以往的会议记录，要求我方再次提出新方案。我方代表严词指出：自从第三项议程开始讨论以来，我方已经一再作了重大的努力。由于对方坚持进行后方视察，我方提出了中立国视察双方同意的特定后方口岸的建议；由于对方坚持轮换武装人员，我方也同意了在合理限度内的轮换。会议的进展要求双方共同努力，如果对方坚持我方作单方面的让步，则会议将不可能有所进展，而拖延停战谈判的责任，将完全在于对方。
