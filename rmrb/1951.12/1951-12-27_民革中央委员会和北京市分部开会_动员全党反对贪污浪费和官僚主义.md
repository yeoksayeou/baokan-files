    [This Newspaper] Report: The Central Committee and Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang jointly held a mobilization meeting against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism on the 25th.

    The meeting was presided over by Chairman Li Jishen. In his speech, he pointed out: "Corruption, waste, and bureaucratism are behaviors that violate the Common Program. Our party takes the Common Program as its program of action, and we must launch a merciless struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism. First of all, we should check the situation of corruption and waste within the party and resolutely eliminate the bureaucratic work style existing within the party." He called on "the entire party to take immediate and active action and promote the masses it is connected with to participate in this political movement of great significance." Finally, he said: "In a new democratic society, corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles are absolutely intolerable and can certainly be completely eliminated."

    Tan Pingshan, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He cited some facts to illustrate how seriously corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles damaged the wealth of the country and the people, and hindered the progress of our society. He emphasized that the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee is a member of the people's democratic united front, and is absolutely not allowed to adopt a laissez-faire attitude of standing idly by regarding the phenomenon of corruption and waste. All members of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee should assist the government in reporting corruption and waste anytime and anywhere.

    Then, Wang Kunlun, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, made a mobilization report. In the report, he pointed out that after preliminary understanding, there are not only quite serious bureaucratic work styles within the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, but also waste and individual corruption phenomena. The Central Committee and local organizations of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee will establish "Economy Inspection Committees" to conduct in-depth inspections. He also focused on criticizing some incorrect understandings and erroneous ideas about this movement, such as some people believing that democratic parties have small institutions and little corruption, and little waste; some people adopting a liberal attitude towards this movement, and some people attributing corruption and waste to objective reasons, etc.

    At the meeting, cadres and party members from the headquarters of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, the Beijing branch, and various agency groups spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their firm response to this call, and guaranteeing to play a leading and exemplary role in this movement. Chen Qiyuan, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the meeting.

    民革中央委员会和北京市分部开会
    动员全党反对贪污浪费和官僚主义
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会和北京市分部在二十五日联合举行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义动员大会。
    大会由李济深主席主持。他在讲话中指出：“贪污浪费和官僚主义是违反共同纲领的行为，本党是以共同纲领为行动纲领，必须对贪污浪费的现象和官僚主义展开无情的斗争。首先应该检查党内贪污浪费的情况，并坚决肃清党内存在着的官僚主义作风。”他号召“全党立即积极行动起来，并推动所联系的群众参加这一具有重大意义的政治运动。”最后他说：“在新民主主义社会中，对贪污浪费的现象和官僚主义的作风，是绝对不能容忍的，而且也是一定可以完全肃清的。”
    民革中央常务委员谭平山也在会上讲了话。他列举一些事实说明贪污浪费和官僚主义作风是如何严重地破坏了国家和人民的财富，阻碍着我们社会的前进。他并着重指出：民革是人民民主统一战线成员之一，对于贪污浪费现象绝对不容许采取袖手旁观的自由主义态度，民革全体党员应协助政府随时随地检举贪污浪费。
    接着由民革中央宣传部部长王昆仑作动员报告。在报告中，他指出：经过初步的了解，民革内部不仅存在着相当严重的官僚主义作风，而且也有浪费和个别的贪污现象，民革中央和各地组织都将成立“节约检查委员会”，进行深入检查。他并且着重批判了对于这一运动的若干不正确的认识和错误的思想，如有人认为民主党派机关不大，无可贪污，浪费也少；有人对这一运动采取自由主义的态度，有人把贪污浪费归之于客观的原因等等。
    会上，民革总部、北京市分部和各机关小组的干部、党员纷纷发言，他们一致表示坚决响应这个号召，保证在这一运动中起带头模范作用。民革中央常务委员陈其瑗也在会上讲了话。
