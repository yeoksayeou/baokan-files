	Drive On Time
		Jiali
	One night, at a railway station in Korea, a train loaded with supplies was about to head to the front. Twenty minutes before departure, the side plate screw support of the locomotive suddenly leaked, the heat dropped, and the steam immediately stopped rising. Seeing that the first train could not depart on time, all the other vehicles would be delayed. Asking the neighboring station for a rescue vehicle would take too much time, so the only way was to get into the firebox to repair it.
	The comrades were very anxious, and the dispatch station called: "Can you depart on time?" The comrade who answered the phone was the deputy driver, Xiang Kui, a member of the Youth League. He turned his head to ask for everyone's opinion. Comrade Guan Huicheng was the first to nod, indicating no problem, and then everyone agreed. So, Xiang Kui firmly replied: "No problem! Drive on time!"
	There were only fifteen minutes left before departure.
	Xiang Kui picked up a water bottle and poured water on himself, saying to everyone: "Comrades, no matter what, we must repair the locomotive within fifteen minutes so that the comrades at the front can use these supplies to eliminate more enemies!" Guan Huicheng also immediately rolled up three straw mats, soaked them in cold water, and opened the door of the firebox.
	As soon as the fire door opened, red flames burst out, and the heat was unbearable. Guan Huicheng, holding the soaked mats, rushed to the fire door and threw the mats into the firebox, and the fire began to weaken. The second and third mats were also thrown in. The firebox was filled with furnace ash, steam, and smoke...making it difficult to open one's eyes and choking one's breath. At this moment, Xiang Kui and Guan Huicheng, soaked all over, with wet towels covering their mouths, holding hammers, squinting their eyes, and bending over, jumped into the firebox to find the problem. The burning coal, the red-hot steel bricks, and iron walls burned their faces and hands, their whole bodies steamed with heat, and their breathing became very urgent. When they found the screw support, they already felt a headache. At this critical moment, Xiang Kui gritted his teeth, raised the hammer, and with a mighty blow, "Clang!" The hot coal dust on the steel wall was shaken down with a rustling sound. Then Guan Huicheng struck a few more times, and the side plate screw support returned to its normal position.
	The three straw mats were already charred yellow, and the flames were about to burn their clothes. Xiang Kui and Guan Huicheng completed their task and jumped out of the firebox nimbly. The crew cheered and warmly embraced these two "iron men."
	The whistle sounded, and the first loaded train departed. For the victory of the front line, whether it's going through fire or water, they will drive on time.

   准时开车
      加里
    一个夜晚，在朝鲜的铁道线某车站上，有一列火车，载着很多的物资，要开往前方。在发车的前二十分钟，机车的侧板螺撑突然漏气了，热力往下降，蒸气马上停止腾升。眼看第一趟车不能准时开出，其余的车辆就都要误点。向邻站要救援车，时间又太匆促，唯一的办法就是钻进火室里去修理。
    同志们正十分着急，调度所来电话了：“能准时发车吗？”接电话的是副司机青年团员向奎同志，他扭转头征求大家的意见，团员关惠承第一个点头表示没问题，接着大家都表示同意，于是，向奎坚定地回话：“没问题！准时开车！”
    距开车的时间只有十五分钟了。
    向奎提起了水筒往自己身上浇水，一面向大家说：“同志们，无论如何我们在十五分钟以内要把机车修好，让前方的同志拿这些物资更多地消灭敌人！”关惠承也马上卷起了三张草席子，浸到凉水里，一面打开火室的门。
    火门一开，通红的火苗顿时喷了出来，热气逼得人不敢近前。关惠承拿着浸湿的席子，一个箭步，冲到火门前，将席子扔进火室里，火势开始减弱下来，第二张第三张席子接着也扔了进去。火室里冒起了炉灰、蒸气、烟火……熏得人两眼难开，呛得人透不过气来。就在这时，向奎和关惠承满身湿淋淋的，嘴上蒙着湿手巾，拿着铁锤，眯着眼，弯着腰跳进了火室，寻找着出毛病的地方。燃烧的煤炭，烧红了的钢砖、铁壁，烤得他俩脸手发痛，浑身腾腾地冒热气，呼吸非常紧迫，当他俩找到螺撑时，已经感到脑袋胀痛了。就在这紧张的时刻，向奎把牙一咬，举起铁锤，猛力一下子，“光当”！钢壁上的热煤屑被震得刷刷地落下来。接着关惠承又连敲了几下，侧板螺撑便回复了正常位置。
    三块草席已烤得焦黄了，火舌快要烧着他俩的衣裳了。向奎、关惠承完成任务，敏捷地跳出了火室。乘务员们拍手欢呼，热烈拥抱着这两个“铁人”。
    汽笛一叫，第一列载重车开出去了。为了前线的胜利，不管是赴汤蹈火，他们都做到准时开车。
