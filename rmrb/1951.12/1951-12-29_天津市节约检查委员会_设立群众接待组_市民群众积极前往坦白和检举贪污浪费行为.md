    Tianjin Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination
    Establishes Mass Reception Group
    Citizens Actively Go to Confess and Report Embezzlement and Wasteful Behavior
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] To carry out a mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the Tianjin Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination established a mass reception group on the 21st. As of the 26th, it had accepted confessions and reports of 30 incidents from the masses. Most districts in the city, as well as government offices that have a lot of contact with the masses, have also established mass reception groups one after another.
    Those who went to the reception group to report included workers, students, shop assistants, housewives, teachers, engineers, district cultural and educational committee members, and residents' representatives. Their active reporting fully demonstrated their responsible attitude towards the property of the state and the people. Industrial and commercial figures in Tianjin also went to confess and report. They stated that after listening to the mobilization report by Mayor Huang Jing and the call by Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, they realized the sin of their colluding with and corrupting state cadres. The policy of "leniency for those who confess voluntarily" further dispelled their concerns. Therefore, they not only confessed to the government their crimes of colluding with cadres and defrauding the state of assets but also reported those embezzlers who took bribes and perverted the law. For example, the manager and staff of a certain iron factory reported a purchasing cadre of a certain state-owned factory. After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched throughout the city, this purchasing cadre not only did not confess but instead used suppression to separately establish conditions for keeping the "secret" with the manager and staff of the iron factory. However, after study, the manager and staff of the iron factory finally dispelled their concerns and confessed and reported to the Municipal Committee for Thrift Examination. The industrial and commercial households who went to confess and report also stated that they were willing to thoroughly transform their old operating style through this movement and actively mobilize their colleagues so that everyone could be transformed in this movement.

    天津市节约检查委员会
    设立群众接待组
    市民群众积极前往坦白和检举贪污浪费行为
    【新华社天津二十七日电】天津市节约检查委员会为开展群众性的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，在二十一日设立了群众接待组，截至二十六日已接受群众坦白、检举事件三十起。全市大部分的区、与群众接触较多的机关，也先后设立了群众接待组。
    前往接待组进行检举的有工人、学生、店员、家庭妇女、教员、工程师及区文教委员、居民代表等。他们积极的检举行为，充分表现了对国家和人民财产的负责态度。天津市工商业者也有前往坦白和检举的。他们表示：听了市长黄敬的动员报告和市工商联合会主任委员李烛尘的号召后，认识到自己拉拢和腐蚀国家干部的罪恶。“自动坦白从轻处理”的政策更打消了他们的顾虑。所以他们不仅向政府交代自己拉拢干部、骗取国家资财的罪行，更检举了那些贪赃枉法的贪污分子。例如某铁工厂的经理和职员就检举了某公营工厂的采买干部。该采买干部在全市展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，不仅不坦白，反而用压制手段和该铁工厂经理及职员分别订立保守“秘密”的条件。但经过学习，该铁工厂经理及职员终于打消顾虑，向市节约检查委员会坦白和检举。前往坦白和检举的工商业户并表示，愿意通过这一运动好好改造自己的旧经营作风，并积极动员同业，使大家都能在这一运动中得到改造。
