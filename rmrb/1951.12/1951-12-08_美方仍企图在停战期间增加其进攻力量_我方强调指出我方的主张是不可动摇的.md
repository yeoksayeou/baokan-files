Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. At the subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice talks on the 7th, under repeated questioning from our side's representatives, the other side stated that it insisted on continuing to transport military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under the pretext of rotating armed personnel and replenishing weapons and ammunition. They opposed our side's proposal that both sides should not transport any military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under any pretext. Regarding our side's proposal to jointly invite neutral countries to establish monitoring institutions to inspect rear ports agreed upon by both sides, the other side still claimed that it could not express agreement or opposition and continued to propose that personnel designated by the belligerent parties form so-called monitoring institutions and observation groups to freely enter and exit the entire Korean territory for so-called "free inspection." At the same time, the other side still insisted on its absurd demands and proposals to retain armed forces in our rear and restrict military equipment. Our side's representative sternly pointed out that the Korean people would never allow the other side to freely enter and exit the entire Korean territory for inspection. Any necessary inspection must be carried out by monitoring institutions composed of neutral countries, and the other side should express a clear and positive opinion on our side's proposal. The Korean people cannot allow the other side to obstruct our construction during the ceasefire, directly interfere in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, nor can they allow the other side to continue to retain armed forces in our rear after the ceasefire, directly threatening our rear. Our side's representative emphasized that since the other side claims to be willing to guarantee the stability of the military armistice and promptly convene a high-level political conference to completely peacefully resolve the Korean issue, there is even less reason to continue to transport military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea during the ceasefire. Our side firmly cannot agree to the other side's attempt to increase its offensive strength during the ceasefire under the guise of rotation and replenishment. Our side's proposal that both sides guarantee not to enter any military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under any pretext is unshakable.

    美方仍企图在停战期间增加其进攻力量
    我方强调指出我方的主张是不可动摇的
    【新华社开城七日电】七日的朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，在我方代表的一再质问下，对方表示坚持以武装人员的轮换与武器、弹药的补充为藉口，在停战期间继续自朝鲜境外运进军事力量、武器和弹药，而反对我方所提出的双方不从朝鲜境外以任何藉口运进任何军事力量与武器、弹药的主张。对于我方所提出的双方共同邀请中立国家成立监察机构到双方所同意的后方口岸进行视察的建议，对方则仍然声称不能表示同意或反对，而继续提出交战双方所指定的人员组成所谓监察机构与观察小组，自由出入于朝鲜全境进行所谓“自由视察”。对方同时仍然坚持其在我方后方保留武装力量及所谓限制军事设备的荒谬要求与主张。我方代表严词指出：朝鲜人民决不能容许对方自由出入朝鲜全境进行视察，任何必要的视察必须由中立国家所组成的监察机构进行，对方应该对我方的建议表示明确正面的意见。朝鲜人民更不能容许对方阻挠我方在停战期间的建设，直接干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政，亦不能容许对方在停战后继续在我方后方保留武装部队直接威胁我方的后方。我方代表强调指出：既然对方声称愿意保证军事停战的稳定，并迅速召开高级的政治会议，以彻底和平解决朝鲜问题，就更没有任何理由在停战期间继续自朝鲜境外运进军事力量与武器、弹药。我方坚决不能同意对方以轮换、补充为名在停战期间增加其进攻力量的企图。我方提出的双方保证不从朝鲜境外以任何藉口进入任何军事力量与武器、弹药的主张是不可动摇的。
