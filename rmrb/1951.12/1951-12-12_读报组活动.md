Reading Group Activities

    Reading and Learning at the Qingzhen Great Temple in Xining
    Experience Worth Promoting
    At the Dongguan Qingzhen Great Temple in Xining, Qinghai, there is a one-hour reading and learning session every day before "prayers." This reading and learning has continued uninterrupted since it began last July. According to statistics from the end of September this year, there have been a total of 340 reading sessions. The number of listeners is very common, increasing from more than 70 at the beginning to more than 200, and reaching more than 470 during Ramadan. Listeners are also frequent.

    Everyone Values Their Newspapers
    The reading work at the Qingzhen Great Temple has been consolidated and developed by overcoming many ideological obstacles. Initially, the problem was whether to believe the people's own newspapers. At the beginning, some people said: "The things in the newspaper, you can't not believe, but you can't completely believe either." What was the basis for this? "Just after liberation, Ma Bufang's red newspaper (special edition) was posted at the entrance of the Great Temple, saying that the People's Liberation Army had been defeated in Lanzhou. But he himself fled in a panic by plane." Therefore, they felt that newspapers could not be trusted. This change in understanding was gradually resolved in multiple reading sessions. In particular, when they saw the news of their reading activities published in the people's newspapers, and it was exactly the same as the actual situation, they came to the conclusion: the Communist Party's newspapers tell the truth.

    Recognizing That Reading Does Not Hinder Religious Belief
    The next question was: "Does reading the newspaper mean that we should not believe in religion? Is it to assimilate us with newspapers, or to replace religion with newspapers!" Over time, they felt that reading the newspaper did not affect chanting scriptures, the newspaper did not oppose their religious beliefs, and there was no slander of religion.

    The Imam had a correct understanding of the newspapers in his mind, and the board of directors of the Qingzhen Great Temple also sponsored the reading work, and stipulated that the newspaper fees of all Qingzhen temples should be paid uniformly by the Qingzhen Great Temple. On May 15th this year, the Qingzhen Great Temple held a symposium of 58 Ahongs to specifically discuss various issues in carrying out reading work. At present, of the ten Qingzhen temples in Xining, except for the two temples in Hebei and the one in Mojialu, the other temples have successively established reading groups.

    Reading and Learning Further Strengthened National Unity
    The most obvious gain is that ethnic unity has been strengthened through reading and learning. In the past, some people suspected: "Will the Communist Party's policies change? Are they coaxing us now?" There were even some vicious rumors, saying "kill the Hui and destroy religion," which greatly affected the emotions of the Hui people at the time. However, from the uninterrupted reading of newspapers and specific facts, everyone recognized the greatness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies. They said that these policies are "as immovable as mountains!" After reading the news of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, they said in a letter to the newspaper: "The Communist Party and the People's Government care for ethnic minorities." And they listed iron facts such as the establishment of a Hui Girls' Primary School by the People's Government in Xining, adding Awen to the school, respecting Hui religious beliefs and Hui customs to illustrate this point. At present, when there are occasional rumors, everyone asks: "Has it been published in the newspaper? If it hasn't been published in the newspaper, don't believe it." Due to the improvement of ideological understanding, their desire for ethnic unity is becoming more and more urgent. The Imam, Deputy Imam, and Changxue (higher teachers) not only participate in listening to the newspaper themselves, but also often urge the Hui people who come to "pray" to say: "Listen to the newspaper carefully. After listening to the newspaper, you can correctly understand the People's Government and the Communist Party. No rumors that sow discord can break up the unity of our nationalities." In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the Qingzhen Temple reading group formulated a patriotic convention to strictly prevent bandits and eliminate special agents, and oppose bad people from tarnishing religion.

    Reading and Learning Improved the Political Awareness of the Hui People,
    They Love the Motherland Even More
    In various political movements, the Qingzhen Great Temple reading group actively participated. They did the following work: 1. Launched a signature campaign of 1,084 people to support the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact, and held a vote against the United States arming Japan. Because they realized that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world, they automatically put forward the slogan: "Defending the motherland is defending Islam." 2. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, the Qingzhen Great Temple reading group organized a roving propaganda team to carry out propaganda in various temples. And wrote more than 30 letters to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and to express condolences to the volunteers. 3. Comforting the families of revolutionary martyrs. During the "August 1st" Army Day, the reading group organized a consolation team for the families of revolutionary martyrs, and the members also voluntarily donated many towels and refreshments, which made the families of revolutionary martyrs very grateful.

    From its establishment to the present, the Xining Qingzhen Great Temple reading group has made everyone realize such a truth: The Hui people must unite around the Communist Party and the People's Government in order to work hard for the construction of the motherland and for the development of the nation's politics, economy, and culture!　Qinghai Daily

    Editor's Note: The Qingzhen temples in Xining use the time of "prayers" to read newspapers, which not only does not hinder the freedom of religious belief, but also strengthens the political education of believers. This method is worth promoting everywhere.

    Freedom of religious belief is the free right of every citizen of the People's Republic of China, and the Common Program has clear provisions for this. However, true freedom of religion can only be obtained by living in a free motherland. Therefore, loving the motherland must be a public virtue that every citizen of the People's Republic of China should possess.

    The experience of the Qingzhen Temple in Xining tells us that regularly reading newspapers is an effective way to strengthen the patriotic concept of religious believers, so that they can care about national affairs and actively participate in various political activities. Their transformation from a state of suspicion and fear to genuine support for the People's Government and love for the motherland is the main gain of reading newspapers. It is hoped that churches in various places will accept the experience and practices of the Qingzhen Temple in Xining, and conduct reading and learning before and after religious activities to strengthen the political education of believers.

    Why I Attach Importance to the Reading Group's
    Leadership Work
    In the past, I did not pay much attention to leading the work of the reading group. I always emphasized that the central work was more important and that the central work was urgent. I did not realize that doing a good job in propaganda was a necessary condition for completing the central work. Therefore, when a reading group was established on the street, I did not intervene. Facts have educated me and made me change this incorrect attitude. In early June, the task of collecting real estate tax was assigned, and the higher authorities called for it to be completed within a week. At that time, most of the cadres in various streets were busy with another task, especially the head of the Sixth Street, because he had made a mistake and was transferred for training, and the work was even more disorganized. I was worried. After everyone's research, I thought that there were some reading groups in the Sixth Street that could be mobilized to help with the work. After the district government convened the reading group leaders to explain the intention, they immediately organized a Yangko dance team to promote and mobilize everywhere, and took the lead in paying 800,000 yuan in real estate tax. After their propaganda, the masses followed suit, and the tax collection work was successfully completed within three days. When the production increase and donation campaign began in late July, the Sixth Street reading group again played a leading role, and the members enthusiastically publicized what they had learned from the newspaper to the masses. These two things caused a change in my thinking. I thought that the reading group had such great enthusiasm, which was inseparable from their daily reading and learning and the improvement of their patriotic enthusiasm. The reading group is a powerful organization for mass, regular self-education, and the leadership of the reading group should be strengthened. On August 5th, we held a meeting of reading group leaders and readers, and rewarded the good reading groups separately, and promoted their experience among cadres and the masses. Since then, I have often gone to various streets to check the situation of the reading group, and many vivid facts have educated me again and again, strengthening my confidence in doing a good job in the reading group. For example, the two reading groups led by Li Xiuzhen in Fourth Street voluntarily donated fruits and vegetables to comfort military families before the Mid-Autumn Festival; Zhao Yuying, a member of the military family reading group, wrote a letter to thank the People's Government, and she also wrote a letter to her son, encouraging him to better serve the people. From August 5th to October 10th, we held six reading group leader meetings, exchanging the activity experience of each reading group at any time, and solving the problems raised by everyone.

    Now we have a total of 77 reading groups and 1,883 members in our district. In the future, we plan to do the following four tasks: (1) In response to the call of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to vigorously promote reading groups, our district will develop to 90 reading groups; (2) Systematically train readers, take out one hour every week to convene readers for collective study, and continue to improve and consolidate reading groups; (3) Stipulate that the situation of the reading groups in the whole district should be checked with emphasis every half month to prevent the occurrence of self-flow, and to educate all reading groups through good and bad typical reading groups; (4) Purposefully lead the reading group so that it becomes a force to promote various central tasks. Recently, we assigned the reading group to study the land reform policy and related materials, and preliminarily studied how to conduct propaganda to the masses.

### 读报组活动

专栏：读报组活动

    读报组活动
    西宁清真大寺的读报学习
    经验值得推广
    青海西宁东关清真大寺，在每天做“礼拜”以前，都有一点钟的读报学习。这种读报学习，从去年七月开始，到现在都没有间断过。据今年九月底的统计，共读报三百四十次。听报的人很普遍，从开始的七十多人，增加到二百多人，斋月时可达到四百七十多人。听报的人也经常。
    人人都重视了自己的报纸
    清真大寺的读报工作，是克服了不少思想障碍才巩固发展起来的。最初碰到的是相信不相信人民自己报纸的问题。开始时有人讲：“报上的事，不可不信，也不可全信。”根据是什么呢？“刚解放时，马匪步芳的红报（号外）贴在大寺门口，说在兰州把解放军打败了。但他自己却慌慌张张地坐飞机跑了。”这样，他们就觉得报纸是不能相信的。这个认识的转变，是在多次读报中逐渐解决的。特别是看到人民的报纸上登载的他们读报活动的消息，和实际情况一模一样时，他们就得出了结论：共产党的报纸是说真实话的。
    认识了读报并不妨碍信教
    紧接着来的一个问题是：“读报是不是叫我们不要信教呢？是要用报纸同化我们，或是用报纸代替宗教吧！”时间一长，他们感到读报并不影响念经，报纸上也不反对他们信教，更没有诬蔑宗教的事情。
    教长在思想上对报纸有了正确的认识，清真大寺董事会也赞助读报工作，并规定各清真寺的报费统一由清真大寺付给。今年五月十五日，清真大寺召开了一个五十八人的阿訇座谈会，专门讨论了开展读报工作中的各项问题。目前西宁的十个清真寺，除了河北两寺及莫家路一寺外，其他各寺都先后成立了读报组。
    读报学习更使民族团结加强了
    最显明的收获，是经过读报学习加强了民族团结。在过去，有些人怀疑：“共产党的政策该不会变吧？现在是不是先哄着我们哩？”更有些恶毒的谣传，说什么“杀回灭教”，当时很影响回民的情绪。但从不间断的读报和具体的事实里，大家认识了毛主席民族政策的伟大。他们说这些政策是“像山一样地动不了！”当读了和平解放西藏的消息后，他们给报社的信上说：“共产党和人民政府，对少数民族是爱护的。”并列举了人民政府在西宁设立回族女子小学，在学校里加授阿文，尊重回教信仰和回民风俗习惯等铁的事实来说明这一点。目前，偶而有些谣传，大家就问：“报上登过没有？报上没登，就不要信它。”由于思想认识的提高，他们要求民族团结的心情一天比一天迫切。教长、副教长、长学（高等教员）不但自己参加听报，还经常督促做“礼拜”的回族人民说：“好好听报，听了报，就可以正确地认识人民政府和共产党，一切挑拨离间的谣言都打不散我们各民族的团结。”在镇压反革命运动中，清真寺读报组订立了严防土匪、肃清特务的爱国公约，反对坏人来沾污宗教。
    读报学习提高了回族人民的
    政治认识，他们更加热爱祖国
    在各项政治运动中，清真大寺读报组都积极参加。他们做了下面的一些工作：一、发动了一千零八十四人签名，拥护缔结五大国和平公约，并举行了反对美国武装日本的投票。因为他们认识到美帝国主义是中国人民、世界人民的死敌，他们自动提出：“保卫祖国就是保卫伊斯兰教”的口号。二、为纪念中国共产党的三十周年，清真大寺读报组组织了巡回宣传队，到各寺进行了宣传。并写了三十多封信向毛主席致敬，向志愿军慰问。三、慰问烈军属。“八一”建军节时，读报组组织了烈军属慰问队，组员们还自愿捐出许多毛巾、点心，使烈军属非常感激。
    西宁清真大寺读报组从成立到现在，使大家认识了这样一个真理：回族人民要团结在共产党、人民政府的周围，才能很好地为建设祖国，为发展民族的政治、经济、文化而努力！　青海日报
    编者按：西宁市各清真寺利用做“礼拜”的时候读报，既不妨碍宗教信仰的自由，又加强了教徒们的政治教育。这种方法值得各地普遍推广。
    宗教信仰是每一个中华人民共和国人民的自由权利，共同纲领对这已有明文规定。但是，真正的信教自由，也只有生活在自由的祖国才能得到。因此，爱祖国就必须是每一个中华人民共和国的公民所应该具备的公德。
    西宁清真寺的经验告诉我们，经常读报是加强宗教信仰者的祖国观念，使他们关心国家大事并积极参加各种政治活动的有效方法之一。他们由怀疑、恐惧的心情转变到真心拥护人民政府、热爱祖国，这是读报的主要收获。希望各地教堂接受西宁清真寺的经验和做法，在进行宗教活动前后，作读报学习，以加强教徒们的政治教育。
    我为什么要重视读报组的
    领导工作
    我过去对领导读报组工作很不重视。我老是强调中心工作多，中心工作要紧，没有认识到做好宣传工作是完成中心工作的必要条件。所以，当街上成立读报组的时候，我就没有过问。事实教育了我，使我改变了这种不正确的态度。六月初，征收房地产税的任务布置下来了，上级号召在一个星期内完成。当时各街大部分干部都正在忙着另一件工作，特别是六街街长因为犯错误调去受训了，工作更没有头绪。我发了愁。经过大家研究，想到六街有一些读报组，可以发动他们帮助工作。当区政府召集读报组长说明意图后，他们立刻组织了秧歌队，到处宣传鼓动，并且带头交出八十万元的房地产税。经过他们的宣传，群众都跟着行动起来，征税工作在三天内就顺利完成了。七月下旬增产捐献运动开始时，六街读报组又起了带头作用，组员们热情地把自己从报纸上学得的东西，向群众进行宣传。这两件事引起了我的思想转变。我想，读报组有这么大的劲头，是和他们每天的读报学习，爱国热情的提高是分不开的。读报组是一个群众性的经常自我教育的有力组织，应该加强对读报组的领导。八月五日，我们召开了一个读报组长和读报员会议，对好的读报组分别奖励，并把他们的经验在干部群众中进行推广。从此以后，我自己经常到各街检查读报组情况，许多活生生的事实，一次又一次地教育了我，加强了我搞好读报组工作的信心。像四街李秀珍领导的两个读报组，在中秋节前夕，自动地捐出了瓜果、菜蔬来慰问军属；军属读报组员赵玉英写信感谢人民政府，她又写信给自己的儿子，鼓励他更好地为人民服务。从八月五日到十月十日的两个月间，我们召开了六次读报组长会议，随时交流了各读报组的活动经验，解决了大家提出的问题。
    现在我们区里共有七十七个读报组，一千八百八十三个组员。今后我们计划要做到下面四项工作：（一）响应中共青海省委大力推行读报组的号召，我们区上要发展到九十个读报组；（二）有计划地训练读报员，每周抽出一小时召集读报员进行集体学习，继续提高和巩固读报组；（三）规定每半月有重点地检查一次全区读报组的情况，以防止自流现象的发生，并通过好、坏典型的读报组来教育所有读报组；（四）有目的地领导读报组，使它成为推动各项中心工作的力量。最近我们给读报组布置了土地改革政策和有关材料的学习，并初步研究了如何向群众进行宣传等问题。
