    7. Parentheses

    Forms of parentheses. There are four types of parentheses: round brackets (()), square brackets ([]), angle brackets (〔〕), and curly brackets (【】). The most commonly used are round brackets. What follows, unless otherwise specified, refers to round brackets.

    Functions of parentheses. Parentheses indicate explanatory parts in an article. For example:

    (1) Executive Bureau Vice-Chairmen of the World Peace Council, Nenni (Italy), Guo Moruo (China), Executive Bureau Member Fage (France), Council Member Korneichuk (Soviet Union), and representatives from Britain and West Germany successively delivered speeches. (News)

    (2) Käthe Schmidt was born on July 8, 1867, in Königsberg, East Prussia. (Lu)

    (3) In trademark work, the Central Bureau of Private Enterprises is also preparing to ban trademarks in foreign languages nationwide (except for those permitted by law), regardless of whether such trademarks are registered (registered ones have already been banned, so there's no issue). (News)

    (4) When encountering such situations (which are frequently encountered), one feels at a loss for words. (Teaching)

    (5) As for eventually feeling disgust towards it, I think it's only natural and shouldn't be attributed to being misled by some place's things or some 'ski' theory. (These two sentences were changed to "not surprising" upon official instructions.) (Lu)

    Should parentheses be used? It is necessary to consider which words and phrases should or should not be placed in parentheses. The following sentence should not use parentheses:

    (6) All his nationalist ideas (expressed in poetry, prose, and actions) are based on this. (News) This sentence should be changed to "His nationalist ideas expressed in his poetry, prose, and actions..." The following is an example of where parentheses should have been used but were not:

    (7) Here, apprentices learn what they need to learn as soon as they enter the factory, and their learning is very focused. The apprenticeship period is also not so long or rigid. The apprenticeship period for complex lathe workers is only three months, and they can be promoted to formal workers immediately after mastering the skills. (Book)

    "The apprenticeship period for complex lathe workers is only three months" should be in parentheses; otherwise, the last clause would refer specifically to lathe apprentices, whereas the author seems to be referring to all apprentices.

    Parentheses and punctuation. If the words in parentheses are only commenting on a part of the sentence, they should be placed immediately after that part. If the main text should have a comma or period here, the comma or period should be placed after the parentheses, as in the format of examples (1), (3), and (4) above. This type of parenthesis can be called "intra-sentence parenthesis."

    If the words in parentheses are commenting on the entire sentence, the parentheses should be placed after the period, as in example (5). This type of parenthesis can be called "extra-sentence parenthesis."

    Intra-sentence parentheses can contain commas (as in the second instance of example 3) or semicolons, but not periods, even if it is already a sentence (as in the second instance of example 3 and example 4).

    Extra-sentence parentheses should have a period if it's a sentence, as in example (5). If it's not a sentence, a period is not necessary, as in (Issue), (News), etc., following the example sentences in this book. The punctuation inside and outside the parentheses in the following three sentences is inappropriate:

    (8) Some works portray the transformation of intellectuals as overly simple and easy. (Such as "ideological problems") There are also such works... (News)

    (9) "Tao" is Tao Yahui, (Tao Yahui died very early), and "Liu" is Liu Yazi. (Issue)

    (10) Due to the financial situation in Britain, Britain's food supply is in an extremely dangerous situation similar to that of 1941 (Note: 1941 was the year of the most severe food shortage in Britain during World War II, when British food imports were drastically reduced due to German submarine attacks.).

    In (8), the period should be placed after the parenthesis. (In fact, the parentheses can also be removed, with a comma before "such as" and a period after the quotation marks.) In (9), the comma before the parenthesis should be removed. In (10), the period inside the parenthesis should be removed.

    When citing a source after a quotation, if it is a partial quote, the comma or period would normally be outside the quotation marks. In that case, the parenthesis is placed immediately after the quotation marks, followed by the comma or period. For example:

    (11) This counterattack swiftly swept away the "confident official tone" of the arrogant U.S. military (Reuters). It gave the "United Nations forces" a stunning blow, causing it to "suffer a decisive defeat" (Associated Press), and "cut up" the U.S. military front line "like a rough wooden saw" (Reuters). (News)

    In the following sentence, the period should be placed after "(Associated Press)":

    (12) MacArthur personally flew to the Korean front line on the morning of November 24 and "ordered the Eighth Army to send 100,000 troops to attack the Yalu River." (Associated Press) According to the Associated Press's report from Tokyo... (News)

    If it is a full quotation, the period is inside, and the parenthesis is outside the quotation marks. There won't be any problems when the quotation is on a separate line or paragraph, or when the quotation happens to be at the end of a paragraph. But if the quotation is in the middle of a line, it will inevitably raise the question of whether the parenthesis belongs to the preceding or following text. For example:

    (13) "...terrible rumors are spreading that the enemy will soon completely defeat them." (Associated Press reporter Bao Yier, 28th dispatch) This pessimistic and disappointed mood has even "greatly increased" among military personnel in Tokyo. (News)

    (14) Before the Tang and Song dynasties, there was only "zaowan" (早晚). For example, "Is your father at home in the morning or evening?" (Yan's Family Instructions), "When will you build your houses?" (Book of Northern Qi), "When will we go down to the Three Bas?" (Li Bai), "When will you get an official position?" (Yinhua Lu), "When will you take the imperial exam?" (Zhiyan), "When will we be able to return together?" (Wei Zhuang). Only after the Yuan dynasty did "duo zaowan" (多早晚) exist.

    To avoid misunderstanding, a space should be left after the parenthesis. There are also alternative solutions: (13) Move the period inside the quotation marks to below the parenthesis (this format is used in Western books and periodicals), (14) Add a semicolon after the parenthesis (use a period for the last one). But using two periods like this, as in

    (15) Now they say: "Let's workers and peasants unite and unite with other classes to build the country better." (Words of a peasant representative from Pingshun). "We must break American aggression..." (News)

    is also not aesthetically pleasing. It would be better to remove the period inside the quotation marks.

    Correcting and supplementing words. Another use of parentheses is not to add a comment in terms of meaning, but to correct or supplement the words above. For example:

    (16) In mid-June, the Civil Affairs Department of the People's Government of Chahar Province convened a meeting of the heads of the Civil Affairs Sections (Bureaus) of all special districts (cities) to specifically discuss preferential treatment work. (News)

    (17) In modern writing, "zai...(zhi)xia" (在……（之）下) is used very extensively.

    In (16), the parenthesis equals "or" or "and." In (17), the parenthesis indicates that the word inside may or may not be used (optional).

    When using parentheses as "or" or "and," be careful, because parentheses often equal "i.e.," and you cannot let the reader be unable to decide your intention. For example:

    (18) Similar situations also exist among literary readers (audiences). (Issue)

    (19) Only more struggle (education, learning) can lead to greater consolidation. (Issue)

    The parenthesis in (18) means "or" or "and," but it can easily be misunderstood as "i.e." It would be better to simply use "or" or "and." As for whether the parenthesis in (19) means "or," "and," or "i.e.," only the author knows.

    Parentheses used in a similar way to (17) also appear in:

    (20) This nameless hill is located on the left side of the Lian(chuan) Yuan(shan) highway. (News) The word in the parenthesis is the word that has been abbreviated. This use of parenthesis is also worth considering. If this abbreviation is familiar to everyone, such as "Jinghan Road," there is no need to use parenthesis to supplement it. If these place names are very unfamiliar, they should not be abbreviated. It would be much better to use "Lianchuan Yuanshan Highway" here.

    The following example sentences only need to use parentheses when quoting other people's words:

    (21) "Be sincere and don't lie." (22) "Old songs still have (empty) hatred when listened to, and when returning to the old garden, there is (but) no home." (Lu) (23) "The red sun is like a fleeting colt, and white hair gradually fills with willow catkins. One [one] Weicheng hostel per day." (24) "[Guo Zhongtian's platoon] After twelve hours of running forward overnight, finally arrived at Sanli and Longyuanli, thirty li south of Junyuli, at eight o'clock in the morning on the twenty-eighth."

    The parenthesis in (21) corrects the misspelling above. Compare this with example (14) in paragraph 5. It cannot be decided whether the character "yuan" (远) there is a mistake for the character "rao" (绕), so a question mark is added; the character "zuo" (佐) here is certainly a mistake for the character "zuo" (做), so no question mark is added. The general meaning of the parenthesis in (22) is "variant version." Lu Xun quoted the "Iron Woman Poem" that was circulating in the world. This poem was actually a forgery by well-wishers who altered Fan Changqi's poem to deceive people. The original characters used in Fan's poem are in parenthesis. The parenthesis in (23) indicates that the original text is missing. The parenthesis in (24) indicates that the original text does not contain these four characters, but if only this sentence is quoted, without the context, it will not be clear without adding these four characters. The parentheses in the latter two examples are generally square.

    Item order. Another use of parentheses is to put them outside the numbers (and "A," "B") to indicate the order of items. This is common in chapters and articles of regulations, and examples will not be given here. The parentheses above the example sentences in this book also belong to this category.

    Numbers with parentheses are also used to indicate footnotes, which will be discussed in another paragraph below.

    Terms to be explained. In dictionaries and textbooks, the terms to be explained are often enclosed in curly brackets, for example:

    (25) 【Radium】Lu Hui cut, pronounced lei. One of the chemical metallic elements, symbol Ra, atomic number 88... (Dictionary) (End of this section, the full text is not finished)

    语法、修辞讲话（第六讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第七段括号
    括号的形式。括号有圆括（（）），方括（［］），六角括（〔〕），方头括（【】）四种。最常用的是圆括。下面谈到的，如果不特别说明，都指圆括。
    括号的作用。括号表示文章中注释的部分。例如：
    （一）世界和平理事会执行局副主席南尼（意）、郭沫若（中）、执行局委员法奇（法）、理事会理事考涅楚克（苏）和英国及德国西部的代表相继发表演说。（报）
    （二）凯绥·勖密特（Kaethe Schmidt）以一八六七年七月八日生于东普鲁士的区匿培克（Koenigs berg）。（鲁）
    （三）在商标工作上，中央私营企业局也准备在全国范围内取缔以外国文字为商标（除依法律规定准其使用者外），不论这种商标是不是注册的（注册的已经取缔，不成问题）。（报）
    （四）遇到这样的情形（这种情形是常常遇到的），就觉得无从下笔。（教）（五）对于它终于怀了恶感，我看也正是人情之常，不必指为拿什么地方的东西迷了什么斯基的理论的。（这两句奉官谕改为“不足怪的”。）（鲁）
    要不要括号？哪些词语应该或是不应该放在括号里面，是需要考虑的。下面这一句就不应该用括号：
    （六）他所有的（在诗文中以及在行为中所表现
    的）民族主义思想，就以此为其基础。（报）这句应改为“在他的诗文中以及行为中所表现的民族主义思想……”。下面这一句是应该用括号而未用的例子：（七）这里，学徒一入厂就学他要学的东西，而且学习很专一，学徒期限也不那样长，那样
    呆板，复杂的车床工人，学徒期限才规定三
    个月，学会了马上便可升为正式工人。（书）“复杂的车床工人，学徒期限才规定三个月”应该放在括号里，否则末了这个分句就专指车床学徒，而作者的意思好像是指所有的学徒的。
    括号和句逗号。如果括号里的词语只是注释句子的一部分的，就应该紧贴在这一部分之后。倘若正文在这里该用句逗号，句逗号应该放在括号之后，如上面（一）（三）（四）例的格式。这种括号可称为“句内括号”。
    如果括号里的词语是注释全句的，括号就应该放在句号之后，如例（五）。这种括号可称为“句外括号”。
    句内括号的内部可以有逗号（如例三的第二处）或分号，但不能有句号，尽管已经是一个句子（如例三的第二处和例四）。
    句外括号内部如果是一个句子，应该有句号，如例（五）。如果不成句子，可以不用句号，如本书例句后面的（期）（报）等。下面这三句括号内外的标点不妥：（八）有些作品则把知识分子的改造写得过分简单轻易。（如“思想问题”）也有这样的作品……（报）（九）“陶”是陶亚魂，（陶亚魂很早就死了），“柳”是柳亚子。（期）（十）由于英国的财政状况，英国的粮食供应已处于和一九四一年（按：一九四一年是英国在第二次世界大战中粮荒最严重的一年，当时的英国食物进口由于德国潜艇的袭击而剧烈减少。）情况相同的极端危险的境地中。（八）应该把句号放在括号后面。（其实括号也可取消，“如”字前面用逗号，引号之后用句号。）（九）括号前面的逗号应取消。（十）括号里面的句号应取消。
    在引文之后用括号注明出处，如果是局部引述，句逗号本来在引号之外，那末，括号紧贴引号，然后加句逗号。例如：
    （十一）这一反攻，迅速地使美军狂妄“自信的
        官方语调一扫而光”（路透社），它给了
        “联合国部队”一次打得目瞪口呆的打击，
        使它“遭到决定性的失败”（美联社），把
        美军部队的战线“打得像一把粗糙的木锯一
        样”（路透社）。（报）底下这一句应该把句号放在“（合众社）”之后：
    （十二）麦克阿瑟并于十一月二十四清晨亲自飞
        往朝鲜前线，“下令派遣第八军十万人向鸭
    绿江进攻”。（合众社）据合众社自东京报
        道……（报）如果是全部引述，句号在内，括号在引号之外。在引文另行或另段的时候，或引文恰好在一段末了的时候，都不会有什么问题。但是假如引文在一行的中间，就不免会引起括号属上抑属下的疑问。例如：（十三）“……恐怖的谣言在散布着，说敌人不
    久就要把他们完全打垮。”（美联社记者包
    义尔二十八日电）这种悲观失望的情绪，
    甚至在东京的军事人员中，也“大大地增
    加”。（报）（十四）唐宋以前只有“早晚”。例如“尊侯早
    晚顾宅？”（颜氏家训）“君等所营宅早晚
    当就？”（北齐书）“早晚下三巴？”（李
    白）“早晚得官？”（因话录）“贤弟早晚
        应举？”（摭言）“早晚得同归去？”（韦
        庄）元以后才有“多早晚”。为了避免误会，括号之后应空一格。还有变通的办法：（十三）把引号里的句号移到括号底下（西文书刊中有这种格式），（十四）在括号之后加分号
    （最后一个用句号）。但是像
    （十五）现在他们说：“咱们工人农民结成联
        盟，再团结好别的阶级，把国家建设得更好
        些。”（平顺农民代表语）。“我们必须打破
        美国的侵略……”（报）这样用两个句号也不好看，不如把引号里的句号取消。
    订正和补充词语。括号另外有一类用法：不是在意义方面加注释，而是对上面的词语作订正或补充。例如：
    （十六）察哈尔省人民政府民政厅于六月中旬曾
        召开各专署（市）民政科（局）长会议，专
        门讨论优抚工作。（报）
    （十七）在现代的文章里，“在……（之）下”
        用得非常广泛。
    （十六）的括号等于“或”或“及”。（十七）的括号表示里头的字或用或不用（可有可无）。
    当“或”或“及”用的括号用起来要小心，因为括号常常等于“即”，不能让读者决定不了你的用意。例如：
    （十八）类似这样的情形，在文艺读者（观众）
        中间也是存在着的。（期）
    （十九）也只有愈斗争（教育、学习）才能愈巩
        固。（期）
    （十八）的括号是“或”或“及”的意思，但很容易被人误会是“即”，不如干脆用“或”或“及”。（十九）的括号究竟是“或”或“及”还是“即”，那就只有作者知道了。
    类似（十七）的用法的括号又有：
    （二十）这座无名小山紧扼着涟（川）元（山）公路的左侧。（报）括号里面的字是被省略的字。这样用的括号也是值得考虑的。假如这个简称为大家所熟悉，如“京汉路”，就无须用括号来补充。假如这些地名很生疏，就不应该省略，像这里就大可用“涟川元山公路”。
    以下的例句的括号只在引用别人文字的时候才用得着：（二一）“实心儿待，休佐（做）谎话儿猜。”（二二）“旧曲听来犹（空）有恨，故园归去已
    （却）无家。”（鲁）（二三）“红日如奔过隙驹，白头渐满杨花雪，
    一日［一］个渭城客舍。”（二四）“［郭忠田排］经过一夜十二个钟头的
    跑步前进，终于在二十八日早晨八时到达军
    隅里以南三十华里的三所里和龙源里。”
    （二一）的括号订正上面的错字，可以跟第五段
    （十四）例比较。那里的“远”字是否“绕”字之误还不能决定，所以加个问号；这里的“佐”字必然是“做”字之误，所以不加问号。（二二）的括号的一般意义是“一本作”。鲁迅先生引的是世间流传的“铁女诗”，这首诗其实是好事者窜改范昌期的诗来骗人的，括号里是范诗原来用的字。（二三）的括号表示原文脱落。（二四）的括号表示原文没有这四个字，但单引这一句，不连上下文，就非加上这四个字不明白。后两例的括号通例用方形的。
    条目次序。括号的另一种用法是加在数目字（及“甲”“乙”）外面，表示条目次序，章则条例里常见，这里不另举例。本书的例句上面的括号也属于这一类。
    数字加括号又用来指示附注，下面另一段讨论。
    待解释词语。在字典和教科书里面，待解释的词语常用方头括号括起，例如：
    （二五）【镭】卢回切，音雷。化学金属原素之
        一，符号为Ra，原子序八八……（字典）（本段完，全文未完）
