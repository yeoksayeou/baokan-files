Health Workers Should Correctly Treat Tissue Therapy

Significant results have been achieved in various regions using tissue therapy. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government in early September this year, approximately 28,854 cases (excluding the Northeast) have used tissue therapy in various regions. Among 8,490 cases of twelve diseases, including ophthalmic diseases, bronchial asthma, peptic ulcers, skin diseases, skin ulcers, neurasthenia, lymph node tuberculosis, neuralgia, scar contractures, allergic reactions, and neuritis, the average treatment effectiveness was 75.34%, which is 11.06% lower than the average effectiveness of 86.4% achieved by Soviet doctor Filatov using tissue therapy.

Medical institutions in various regions have achieved significant results in using tissue therapy. For example, the China Medical University in Shenyang and its affiliated hospitals have performed nearly 3,000 cases. Under the direct leadership of the Health Department of the Northeast People's Government, they mobilized more than 150 people to devote themselves to research experiments on tissue therapy, established a central research group with literature, basic science, manufacturing, clinical, statistics, and liaison groups to conduct research experiments combining theory and clinical practice. Dr. Hu Zijie of the Puyang Prefectural People's Hospital in Pingyuan Province used tissue therapy in difficult rural environments to treat nearly 3,000 cases, which aroused the local people's trust in tissue therapy. These facts undeniably prove that tissue therapy is indeed a good treatment method, especially opening up new treatment directions for chronic diseases.

However, in the process of using tissue therapy, two situations have been found in some areas: One is that some senior physicians expressed doubts about tissue therapy and adopted a wait-and-see attitude, or even openly resisted and secretly obstructed it. Some said: "We have not received instructions from the Ministry of Health of the Central Government."

(Editor's note: The instructions of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government on actively promoting "Tissue Therapy" were issued on March 3 this year.) Some said: "We have not seen any news about tissue therapy in British and American magazines." A well-known ophthalmologist in Beijing even advised patients that it would be best to try tissue therapy sparingly. The other situation is that some physicians are perfunctory in using tissue therapy and lack a serious scientific attitude. For example, a hospital in Fujian sent old materials to another hospital, resulting in eight patients dying from tetanus. A medical clinic in Xi'an caused a patient to suffer from tetanus after using tissue therapy due to operational errors. Some hospitals caused suppuration in patients due to poor techniques. Some did not select cases and used it for all diseases. For example, for a child with pneumonia, the doctor did not use effective methods for treatment, but casually listened to the family's request and used tissue therapy, which killed the child. There was also a patient with retinal detachment who should have received early electrotherapy, but the doctor wanted to experiment with tissue therapy, which delayed the illness. Even worse, some pharmaceutical factories and doctors used tissue therapy as a gimmick for speculation. For example, a private pharmaceutical factory in Shanghai transported two bottles of 24 cc tissue lysate from Qingdao to Xi'an and sold them at a high price of over 60,000 yuan (should have been sold for over 20,000 yuan). A practicing doctor in Beijing even posted an advertisement: "Using tissue therapy to treat various diseases."

In order to effectively promote tissue therapy, local health and pharmaceutical departments should educate health workers in response to the above situations and correct their incorrect attitudes and misunderstandings about tissue therapy.

### 卫生工作人员应正确地对待组织疗法

    卫生工作人员应正确地对待组织疗法
    各地使用组织疗法已获显著效果。据中央人民政府卫生部今年九月初的不完全统计：各地使用组织疗法的病例约二万八千八百五十四例（东北不在内）。在治疗眼科疾病、支气管喘息、消化性溃疡、皮肤病、皮肤溃疡、神经衰弱、淋巴腺结核、神经痛、瘢痕挛缩、过敏反应和神经炎等十二种疾病的八千四百九十病例中，其治疗效果平均为百分之七十五·三四，与苏联费拉托夫使用组织疗法的百分之八十六·四的平均疗效相比，差百分之一一·○六。
    各地医疗机构在使用组织疗法方面都收到了显著的效果。如沈阳中国医科大学及其附属医院已施行了近三千病例之多，并在东北人民政府卫生部直接领导下，动员了一百五十余人致力于组织疗法的研究实验，成立中心研究组，下设文献、基础、制造、临床和统计、联络等组，进行理论与临床相结合的研究实验工作。平原濮阳专署人民医院胡子洁大夫在农村困难环境下，使用组织疗法，治疗了约近三千病例，引起了当地群众对组织疗法的信任。这些事实，无可争辩地证明了组织疗法确是一种良好的治疗方法，特别是为慢性疾病开辟了新的治疗方向。
    但有些地区在使用组织疗法的过程中，曾发现这样两种情况：一种是某些高级医师对组织疗法表示怀疑，并采取观望，甚至公然抵抗，暗中阻止的态度。有的说：“我们没有接到中央卫生部的指示。”
    （编者按：中央人民政府卫生部关于组织推行“组织疗法”的指示已于本年三月三日发布）有的说：“在英美杂志上没有见过组织疗法的消息。”北京某著名眼科医师且曾向病人宣传以少试组织疗法为妙。另一种情况是：有些医师对使用组织疗法草率从事，缺乏严肃的科学态度。如福建某医院把做成的旧材料寄给另一医院使用，有八个病人因此发生破伤风而死亡；西安某医务所因操作错误，有一病人在使用组织疗法后而患破伤风；有的医院因技术不良而使病人发生化脓现象；有的则对病例不加选择，什么病都使用，如对一个患肺炎的小孩，医师不给用有效方法治疗，随便听从家属要求，使用组织疗法，而把小孩弄死了；还有一个视网膜脱离的病人，本来应予早期电疗，但医师却要用组织疗法试验，结果反而把病耽误了。更坏的是某些药厂与医师，竟以组织疗法为招牌，进行投机，如上海某私营药厂，将两瓶二十四西西的组织浸液由青岛运至西安以六万余元的高价出售（应售二万余元）；北京某开业医生居然贴出广告：“使用组织疗法，治疗各种疾病。”
    为了有效地推广组织疗法，各地卫生医药部门应针对上述情况，向卫生工作人员进行教育，纠正对组织疗法的不正确态度和错误认识。
