Introducing "China Youth Daily"
		Chi Rong
	The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League officially published its official newspaper, "China Youth Daily," on April 27th of this year. This is the first national youth newspaper published in our country, and it is a major event in the political and cultural life of Chinese youth.
	"China Youth Daily" is a product of the development of the Chinese youth movement. Since the "May Fourth" Movement, the Chinese youth movement has maintained a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the China New Democratic Youth League is the heir to this glorious tradition. At present, there are more than five million Youth League members nationwide. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they have actively participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and various national construction projects, becoming an important force. The task of "China Youth Daily" is "to strengthen the guidance of the Youth League's work, to strengthen the propaganda and education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought within the Youth League and among the vast number of young people across the country, so that the League's organization can better play its role as an assistant and reserve force of the Party" (see the Youth League Central Committee's "Decision on Publishing 'China Youth Daily'"). For the past six months, "China Youth Daily" has been working in accordance with this policy and has developed its own distinct characteristics.
	The first characteristic of "China Youth Daily" is its guiding role in the youth movement in our country. "China Youth Daily," according to the working policy of the Youth League Central Committee, educates young people across the country to respond to every call of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and actively participate in the current revolutionary struggle and national construction work; at the same time, it constantly solves various problems existing in the minds of young people. The editorial commemorating "May Fourth" this year criticized the erroneous practice of separating propaganda work from the central task, pointing out to the vast number of young people that in the future, in the in-depth Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the patriotic education of Resist America, Aid Korea should be combined with actual work. In the propaganda to mobilize students to participate in military cadre schools, various types of articles such as editorials, news reports, newsletters, and Q&A were published in a planned manner, and all of them were permeated with a central idea, that is, to carry out education on strengthening national defense, collectivism, and revolutionary heroism among the vast number of young people, and to provide appropriate solutions to the problems that arise in each stage of the work, thereby cooperating with the progress of this movement.
	"China Youth Daily" frequently provides guidance to the work of the Youth League. It not only analyzes the problems in various practical works and points out clear directions, but also uses great efforts to concentrate the experiences of the masses and promote them. "China Youth Daily" has published commentaries and introduced some experiences on how the Youth League organizations play a role in patriotic labor competitions, democratic reforms, agricultural labor mutual aid, and land reform movements, as well as how the Youth League carries out work in schools. At the same time, from September, it reported more centrally and continuously on the working method created by Hao Jianxiu, a Youth League member of the Qingdao No. 6 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, and the situation of its promotion in various places, educating young people to learn Hao Jianxiu's work attitude and the quality of cherishing the property of the motherland, giving the young masses a deeper impression. The editorial on June 5, "Starting from the 'Learn from Zhang Haitao Movement'," criticized the "Learn from Zhang Haitao Movement" carried out in elementary schools in Shenyang City, and made a clear explanation on the issue of establishing banners among young people and children: "The highest model and banner for Youth League members and Young Pioneers is the long-tested Party leader, Chairman Mao, not others. We should not and cannot propose model figures for all-round learning from the ranks of Youth League members or Young Pioneers." In the recent period, it has further criticized the tendency of some local Youth League organizations to ignore politics, not pay attention to political work among League members and young people, and the phenomenon of grassroots League organization cadres holding multiple positions, having too many meetings, and being busy and chaotic in their work.
	How to report on the youth movement is a principled issue that a youth newspaper encounters first. The newspaper often publishes news and articles about youth movements at home and abroad, and focuses on introducing some advanced figures among young people to encourage their enthusiasm and creativity, which is absolutely necessary; but the youth movement is part of the mass movement, and it is wrong to report on the youth movement in isolation or excessively prominently. Therefore, in reporting, one should correctly grasp the position of the youth movement in the mass movement of the people. Young people need to learn from the youth movement and the examples of young people themselves, but they need even more to use the achievements of the entire country and the vast number of people to educate the younger generation. It is not difficult to see from the layout of "China Youth Daily" that it pays attention to reflecting the overall picture of national construction and mass movements. It uses rich materials from the people's revolutionary struggle and the great achievements of New China's construction to carry out patriotic education among the vast number of young people. On the one hand, it regards the central task of the Party and the government in each period as the central task and reporting policy of the youth movement for propaganda; on the other hand, from the perspective of education, it focuses on reporting the participation of young people in the current revolutionary struggle and national construction, and gives specific guidance according to the characteristics and requirements of young people, combining the two correctly.
	Guiding youth thinking and helping youth learn are the second extremely important tasks of "China Youth Daily," and also its second characteristic. That is to say, it must frequently explain various issues to the vast number of young people from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time criticize various incorrect ideas among the young masses, especially incorrect ideas that hinder the current struggle. For example, in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the young masses were educated to raise their vigilance and draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and the erroneous views of so-called "benevolence" and "having two positions" were criticized; recently, in the propaganda to implement the Marriage Law, a struggle against the remnants of feudal ideas was launched. In addition, many articles on the cultivation of youth thinking are frequently published to tell young people how to treat work, study, and life, and help them establish a revolutionary outlook on life and the universe.
	"China Youth Daily" strives for popular propaganda of communism and the Communist Party, educating League members and young people to completely trust the leadership of the Party and resolutely implement the Party's policies and guidelines. In order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party, from late June to late July, a series of essays, newsletters, and comic strips of Party history were published to illustrate that young people must study the great and glorious struggle history of the Chinese Communist Party; to illustrate that the Party and Chairman Mao have always cared about the lives and struggles of Chinese youth; to illustrate that the brilliant achievements of the Chinese youth movement are inseparable from the leadership and education of the Party. At the same time, it published articles introducing Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities in his youth and stories of the heroic struggles of many revolutionary leaders, revolutionary martyrs, and communists. Not long ago, "China Youth Daily" published an article calling on Youth League members to actively participate in the study of communism and the Communist Party to strengthen League members' understanding of communism, the Communist Party, and the future of the motherland, and to correctly understand the relationship between the Party and the League.
	"China Youth Daily" attaches great importance to the propaganda of current events and policies. It frequently educates young people to care about politics and study the various policies of the People's Government. It frequently provides popular explanations of the editorials of the "People's Daily" and the current commentaries of the "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue," making itself an assistant to the "People's Daily" in terms of current events and policy propaganda. It explains the Party's policies in a popular way, mainly through the "Propagandist's Speech Materials" in each issue. The issues discussed each time are focused, the reasoning is clear, the examples are vivid, and the writing is simple, which is generally loved by young people.
	The third characteristic of "China Youth Daily" is its accessibility. This is determined according to the needs of the vast number of Chinese youth today. It wants to make it so that young people with a cultural level of higher elementary school or above can generally understand it. In terms of popularization work, it has made some attempts, such as in the propaganda of current affairs, in addition to popularly rewriting Xinhua News Agency's telegrams, it also made popular propaganda through forms such as "Current Affairs Speeches," "News Briefs," "Current Affairs Mailbox," and "Materials." In this way, young people who lack knowledge can have a more comprehensive understanding of the development of the situation, and even historical background, geographical knowledge, etc. "China Youth Daily" pays great attention to using literary and artistic forms to educate young people. In addition to publishing some literary works on the third page of each issue, it also publishes two special literary and artistic issues on the fourth page every month. Among the literary and artistic works published in the above-mentioned editions, such as "Marriage," "Little Hu Jiu," and "Young People, Let Your Youth Be More Beautiful," have had a good impact on readers. In addition, in terms of form, the articles in "China Youth Daily" are short, the characters are large, and there are many illustrations, striving to achieve "pictures and texts together," with illustrations occupying about a quarter of each issue. Four pictorials are also published every month. These are welcomed by the vast number of young readers and some county and district cadres. Therefore, the circulation of the newspaper has increased to 200,000 copies in just over half a year.
	The shortcomings of "China Youth Daily" are mainly insufficient connection with reality, such as not doing enough in terms of cooperating with the current national construction and encouraging and educating young people to actively participate in various struggles; the incorrect ideas existing among young people cannot be systematically and profoundly analyzed and criticized; and in the implementation of popularization, much more effort will have to be made in the future. "China Youth Daily" is still in its initial stage, and we believe that these shortcomings can be overcome in future work.

    介绍“中国青年报”
    池荣
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在今年四月二十七日正式出版了自己的机关报——“中国青年报”。这是我国第一次出版的全国性的青年报纸，是我国青年政治生活和文化生活中的一件大事。
    “中国青年报”是我国青年运动发展的产物。自“五四”以来，中国青年运动一直保持着光荣的革命传统，中国新民主主义青年团就是这一光荣传统的继承者。目前，全国青年团员已达五百余万，他们在中国共产党的领导下，积极参加了抗美援朝运动和国家各项建设工作，成为一个重要的力量。“中国青年报”的任务，就是“为了加强指导青年团的工作，加强在青年团内及全国广大青年中进行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的宣传教育，使得团的组织更好地发挥党的助手作用与后备军作用”（见青年团中央“关于出版‘中国青年报’的决定”）。半年来，“中国青年报”正是遵循着这一方针进行工作的，并已具有自己的鲜明特点。
    “中国青年报”的第一个特点是对我国青年运动的指导作用。“中国青年报”根据青年团中央的工作方针，教育全国青年响应共产党和人民政府的每一号召，积极参加当前的革命斗争和国家建设工作；同时不断地解决青年思想中所存在的各种问题。今年纪念“五四”的社论，就批判了宣传工作和中心任务脱节的错误作法，给广大青年指出：今后在深入抗美援朝运动中，应使抗美援朝的爱国主义教育和实际工作结合起来。在动员学生参加军事干部学校的宣传中，则有计划地发表了社论、新闻报导、通讯、问答等各类文章，并且都贯穿着一个中心思想，即向广大青年进行加强国防、集体主义、革命英雄主义的教育，并针对每一工作阶段中所发生的问题，给以适当的解决，从而配合了这个运动的进行。
    “中国青年报”经常对青年团的工作进行指导。它不仅对各种实际工作中的问题经过分析，指出明确的方向；同时以极大的力量来集中群众的经验，加以推广。关于青年团组织在爱国主义劳动竞赛、民主改革、农业劳动互助、土地改革等运动中如何发挥作用，以及青年团在学校中如何进行工作，“中国青年报”都发表了言论，并介绍了一些经验。同时从九月起曾较集中地连续地报道了国营青岛第六棉纺织厂青年团员郝建秀所创造的工作法及各地推广的情形，教育青年学习郝建秀的劳动态度和爱护祖国财产的品质，给予青年群众以较深刻的印象。六月五日“从‘学习张海涛运动’说起”的社论中，对沈阳市小学开展的“学习张海涛运动”作了批判，并对在青年儿童中树立旗帜的问题，作了清楚的说明：“青年团员和少年儿童队员的最高典范和旗帜，是久经考验的党的领导者，是毛主席，不是别人。我们不应也不能从青年团或少年儿童队的队伍中，来提出团员和少年儿童队员的全面学习的典范人物。”最近一个时期，更对某些地方青年团组织忽视政治的倾向，不重视团员、青年中的政治工作，团的基层组织干部兼职、开会过多，工作忙乱等现象进行了批评。
    如何报道青年运动，这是一个青年报纸首先遇到的原则性的问题。该报经常刊载国内外青年运动的消息和文章，并着重地介绍过一些青年中的先进人物，以鼓舞青年们的积极性、创造性，这是完全必要的；但青年运动是群众运动的一部分，孤立地或过分突出地报道青年运动是错误的，因之在报道时就应该正确地掌握青年运动在人民群众运动中的位置。青年需要从青年运动和青年本身事例来学习，但更需要用整个国家和广大人民群众的成就，来教育青年一代。从“中国青年报”的版面上不难看出：它是注意反映国家建设和群众运动的全貌的。它运用丰富的人民革命斗争和新中国建设伟大成就的材料，对广大青年进行了爱国主义教育。它一方面把党和政府每一时期的中心任务，当作青年运动的中心任务和报道方针进行宣传；另一方面又从教育观点出发，着重地报道了青年参加当前革命斗争和国家建设的情况，根据青年的特点和要求，加以具体指导，把两者正确地结合了起来。
    指导青年思想，帮助青年学习，是“中国青年报”第二项极重要的任务，也是它的第二个特点。这就是说，它要以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的立场、观点、方法，经常向广大青年解释各种问题，同时批判青年群众中各种不正确的思想，特别是妨害当前斗争的不正确思想。比如在镇压反革命运动中，曾对青年群众进行了提高警惕、划清敌我界限的教育，批判了那种所谓“仁慈”、“可以有两个立场”的错误观点；最近又在贯彻婚姻法的宣传中，开展了反对封建思想残余的斗争。此外，还经常发表许多有关青年思想修养的文章，告诉青年如何对待工作、学习和生活，帮助他们建立革命的人生观和宇宙观。
    “中国青年报”努力于共产主义和共产党的通俗宣传，教育团员和青年完全信任党的领导，并坚决执行党的方针、政策。为了纪念党的三十周年，从六月下旬至七月底，发表了一系列的论文、通讯以及党史连环画，用以说明青年必须学习中国共产党伟大而光荣的奋斗历史；说明党和毛主席从来就关怀中国青年的生活和斗争；说明中国青年运动的光辉成就，是和党的领导教育分不开的。它同时刊载了介绍毛主席青年时期革命活动的文章和许多革命领袖、革命先烈以及共产党员的英勇斗争的故事。不久以前，“中国青年报”著文号召青年团员积极参加关于共产主义和共产党的学习，以加强团员对于共产主义、共产党的认识，对于祖国前途的认识，正确地理解党和团的关系。
    “中国青年报”很重视时事和政策的宣传。它经常教育青年关心政治，学习人民政府的各项政策。它经常对“人民日报”的社论和“抗美援朝专刊”的时评，加以通俗解释，使自己在时事和政策宣传方面，成为“人民日报”的助手。它通俗地解释党的政策，主要是通过每期的“宣传员讲话资料”去进行。每次所讲问题集中，说理清楚，举例生动，文字浅显，一般青年都很爱读它。
    “中国青年报”的第三个特点是通俗。这是根据今天广大中国青年的需要而确定的。它要使具有高小以上文化水平的青年大致都能看懂。在通俗化工作上，它曾努力作了一些尝试，如在时事宣传方面，除通俗改写新华社电讯稿以外，还通过“时事讲话”、“要闻简述”、“时事信箱”、“资料”等形式，作了通俗的宣传。这样使知识缺乏的青年，就能够较全面地了解时局的发展，以至历史背景、地理知识等。“中国青年报”很注意用文艺的形式去教育青年。它除每期在第三版上刊登一些文艺作品外，每月还要在第四版上出两期文艺专刊。上述各版所发表的文艺作品中，如“结婚”、“小胡久”、“年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧”等，在读者中都发生了很好的影响。另外，“中国青年报”在形式上，文章短小，字大画多，尽量做到“图文并载”，每期插画约占四分之一的篇幅。每一个月还要出四期画刊。这些都受到广大青年读者以及部分县区干部的欢迎。因此，报纸的销行量，只半年多时间就增加到二十万份。
    “中国青年报”的缺点，主要是联系实际不够，如在配合当前国家建设、鼓舞和教育青年积极参加各种斗争方面还做得不够；对于青年中存在的不正确思想还不能系统地深刻地进行分析批判；在贯彻通俗化方面今后也还得作很大的努力。“中国青年报”现在还是初创时期，我们相信，这些缺点在今后的工作中是能够克服的。
