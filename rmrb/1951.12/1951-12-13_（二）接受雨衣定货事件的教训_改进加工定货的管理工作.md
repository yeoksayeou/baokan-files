    (II) Learn a Lesson from the Raincoat Ordering Incident and Improve the Management of Processing Orders
    Today, this newspaper publishes an abstract of the circular issued by the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council regarding the handling of the military raincoat processing and ordering incident in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Beijing. State financial and economic departments and private industrialists and merchants in various regions should learn the lessons they should from this incident.
    For more than a year, state organs' entrusted processing and ordering work with private enterprises has been successful. The state has helped private enterprises overcome the difficulties they encountered in the initial stage of economic restructuring, strengthened the planning of private enterprise production and management, and made them subordinate to the needs of the state and the interests of the people, creating a large amount of wealth for the state and the people. At the same time, private enterprises that meet the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood have obtained legitimate benefits, and their production and business are thriving. However, there are also many shortcomings in the entrusted processing and ordering work, and some individual cases have even led to very serious errors, causing undue losses to state property and the interests of the people. The raincoat ordering incident is a prominent example.
    This incident shows that: Bureaucracy is the deadly enemy of all national construction undertakings and the interests of the people. The fact that unscrupulous merchants such as Qiao Mingxun dared to boldly display their deceptive skills and were able to carry out their deceptive activities is precisely because some staff members of certain financial and economic departments have serious bureaucratic work styles. They have long been unfamiliar with matters within the scope of their duties entrusted by the people, lack a serious and responsible spirit for state property and the interests of the people, neither understand nor learn, and are also careless and indifferent. They believe whatever the unscrupulous merchants say. Even though it had been discovered in the past that private manufacturers had falsely reported the specifications and standards of waterproof cloth, the responsible cadres in charge of this entrusted processing and ordering work were still not vigilant. These cadres were completely ignorant of the equipment and production capacity of the private factories accepting the processing orders, and did not conduct investigations and research in advance, but arbitrarily "took responsibility" for arranging tasks and signing contracts. Although they later conducted "investigations," because bureaucrats do not want to rely on the worker masses and cannot see the worker masses, the investigations were not thorough, and they could not promptly discover the tricks played by the unscrupulous merchants. The unscrupulous merchants accurately identified and exploited the weaknesses of these staff members to achieve their despicable purpose of speculation and profiteering.
    This incident also revealed the chaos in the work system of certain financial and economic departments. Unclear responsibilities and mutual reliance and buck-passing among relevant agencies also allowed unscrupulous merchants to take advantage of loopholes. The Logistics Department of the North China Military Region relied on the General Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government; the industry and commerce administrative departments of Tianjin, Qingdao, and Beijing also relied on the Ministry of Light Industry and other higher-level leading organs, and adopted a bystander attitude towards this matter; the Ministry of Light Industry believed that it was only an "intermediary" and completed its task once the contract was signed. The serious situation exposed by this incident, in which there was no inspection, no supervision, unclear responsibilities, and no strict system, would have endless harm if it were not thoroughly eliminated.
    This incident also exposed the political paralysis of some cadres engaged in financial and economic work. They failed to fully and clearly grasp and implement the state's economic policies. The People's Government encourages and supports the development of private economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. We have done this, and generally speaking, we have done it well. However, at the same time, it is necessary to further strengthen the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy over private industry and commerce; it is even more necessary to be vigilant against a small number of degenerates in the private industrial and commercial sector who are deeply infected with the bad habits left over from the old society and have no patriotic ideas; they are unwilling to engage in legitimate production and management, but are wholeheartedly pursuing exorbitant profits, engaging in speculation and sabotage, and stealing state property. Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production, the completion of land reform in vast areas, the increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural people, and the strengthening of national defense construction, the demand for industrial products exceeds the supply, and illegal manufacturers are more likely to take the opportunity to seek exorbitant profits. If we blindly and unreservedly trust all private industrialists and merchants, and neglect or relax the necessary prevention and struggle against illegal elements among them, we will be deceived, and the interests of the state and the people will be harmed. Recently, in processing and ordering, phenomena such as private factories skimping on materials, using fake materials to pass off as genuine, falsely reporting costs, refusing to deliver goods, and defrauding money without goods have continued to occur. For example, the Communications Department of the Southwest Military Region ordered flat-nose pliers from the Chongqing Private Fuxing Iron Factory, which actually only cost 40,000 yuan per piece, but the factory estimated the price at 75,000 yuan per piece; when the Zhenjiang Private Taifeng Rice Mill processed rice for the China Grain Company, it actually replaced public rice by mixing in inferior rice and stone powder; when the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee ordered louver blades for tea machines from private factories, the price quoted by the Shanghai Private Machinery Industry Third Joint Venture was more than twelve times the transaction price. The Shanghai unscrupulous merchant Liu Guangfa and others even disregarded the safety of the lives and property of the people on both sides of the Huai River, defrauded the Huai River Management Committee of huge bid funds, but did not deliver the contracted stones. The Chongqing Private Yuanchang Metal Sheet Factory falsely claimed to have 100 tons of goods and defrauded the Industrial Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee of 60% of the total price of 100 tons of goods. There are also some private factories that even resist the state's entrusted processing and ordering. When they encountered difficulties, the government helped them overcome the difficulties by means of processing and ordering; now processing and ordering still gives them reasonable profits. But they are ungrateful and disregard the interests of the state and the people. Some private manufacturers shamelessly declared: "Last spring, when we were in difficulty, the government's entrusted processing and ordering was 'sending charcoal in the snow,' which we welcomed; now there is no need for 'icing on the cake.'" They are afraid that they will not earn enough money and always want to escape the normal track of the New Democratic economy. They are unwilling to accept processing orders, or after accepting them, they resort to various shameless means to make trouble, trying to take advantage of loopholes and seek exorbitant profits. They think that the cadres of the People's Government are deceiving, and they think that the People's Government can do nothing about them. But they are wrong! The People's Government will never allow them to do whatever they want. If they do not repent, please let them see the fate of unscrupulous merchants such as Qiao Mingxun!
    The departments in charge of processing and ordering in various regions should learn from the painful lessons of these incidents, conduct serious inspections of the problems in their work, systematically summarize good experiences, tighten up systems, clarify responsibilities, and in the movement to increase production and practice economy, effectively improve their working conditions, maintain correct public-private relations, and avoid losses to state property and the interests of the people.
    Unscrupulous merchants such as Qiao Mingxun are completely guilty of deserving the punishment of state law. Some manufacturers have adopted an attitude of mutual cover-up towards Qiao Mingxun and others. They should earnestly recognize their mistakes and mend their ways. All legitimate private industrialists and merchants should regard the behavior of Qiao Mingxun and others as the most shameful thing, be determined to change their speculative thinking of seeking exorbitant profits; abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, cherish the property of the people of the motherland, stand with the broad masses of the people, and resolutely fight against all speculative and opportunistic thoughts and behaviors that pursue exorbitant profits!

### （二）接受雨衣定货事件的教训  改进加工定货的管理工作

    （二）接受雨衣定货事件的教训  改进加工定货的管理工作
    今天本报发表了政务院人民监察委员会关于处理天津、青岛、北京三市军用雨衣加工定货事件的通报摘要。国家财政经济部门的工作人员和各地私营工商业者都应当从这个事件中取得应有的教训。
    一年多以来，国家机关对私营企业的委托加工和定货工作，是有成绩的。国家曾帮助私营企业解除了在经济改组初期所遭遇到的困难，加强了私营企业生产和经营的计划性，并使它们服从国家的需要和人民的利益，为国家和人民创造了大量的财富。同时，适合国计民生需要的私营企业得到了合法的利益，生产和营业日益欣欣向荣。但是，委托加工定货工作也有许多缺点，个别的甚至发生了很严重的错误，使国家财产和人民利益遭受了不应有的损失。雨衣定货事件就是一个显著的例子。
    这个事件说明了：官僚主义是国家各种建设事业和人民利益的死敌。奸商乔铭勋等敢于大胆地施展他们的欺骗本领而且能够遂行他们的欺骗活动，正是因为某些财政经济部门的某些工作人员有严重的官僚主义作风。他们对人民委托给自己的职务范围以内的事情长期不熟悉，对于国家财产和人民利益缺乏认真负责的精神，既不懂又不学习，还又马马虎虎，满不在乎。奸商说什么，他们就听信什么。甚至过去就已发现过私营厂商中有谎报防雨布规格标准的情形，主持这次委托加工定货工作的负责干部还是毫无警惕，这些干部对于接受加工定货的私营工厂的设备情况和生产能力茫然无知，事先也不进行调查研究，就擅自“负责”布置任务、签订合同。后来虽也作过“调查”，但因为官僚主义者是不想依靠工人群众也看不见工人群众的，所以调查得很不深入，对于奸商耍的鬼把戏不能及时发现。奸商看准了并且利用了这些工作人员的弱点，以达他们投机取巧攫取暴利的卑鄙目的。
    这个事件也表现了某些财经部门工作制度上的混乱。责任不明确，各有关机关互相依赖，互相推诿，也就使奸商有机可乘。华北军区后勤部军需部依赖人民革命军事委员会总后勤部和中央人民政府轻工业部；天津、青岛、北京三市工商行政部门也依赖轻工业部等上级领导机关，对此事采取旁观态度；轻工业部认为自己只不过是“中介人”，签订了合同就完成了任务。这个事件暴露出来的这种既无检查、又无督促、责任不分明、制度不严密的严重情况，如果不彻底肃清，贻害是无穷的。
    这个事件并且暴露出了某些做财经工作的干部政治上的麻痹，他们没有能够完整地清醒地掌握和执行国家的经济政策。凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，人民政府是鼓励它们经营的积极性并扶助它们发展的。我们这样做了，而且一般地说做得不错。但是，同时还必须进一步加强人民政府和国营经济对于私营工商业的领导；更必须警惕私营工商业界仍有一小部分败类，他们深染旧社会所遗留的坏习气，毫无爱国思想；他们不愿作正当的生产和经营，而一心追逐暴利，进行投机破坏，窃取国家财产。由于工农业生产的发展，土地改革在广大地区的完成，城乡人民购买力的提高，国防建设的加强，工业品供不应求，不法厂商就更要乘机牟取暴利。如果我们盲目地一味信赖所有的私营工商业者，而忽视或放松了对于其中不法分子进行必要的防范和斗争，我们就会上当，国家人民的利益就会受到损害。近来，在加工定货中，私营工厂偷工减料、以假混真、谎报成本、拒不交货、无货骗款等现象不断发生。如西南军区通讯处向重庆私营复兴铁工厂定制平头钳子，实际每把只需四万元，该厂却把每把估价为七万五千元；镇江私营泰丰碾米厂给中国粮食公司加工时，竟用掺和次稻和石粉的办法盗换公稻；华东军政委员会工业部向私营工厂定制茶叶机零件百叶板时，上海私营机器业第三联营所所报价格竟超过成交价格十二倍之多。上海奸商刘光法等甚至不顾淮河两岸人民生命财产的安全，诈骗治淮委员会的巨额标款，而不交承包的石块。重庆市私营元昌金属制片厂谎称有货百吨，向西南军政委员会工业部骗去一百吨货的全部价款的百分之六十。还有些私营工厂甚至抗拒国家的委托加工和定货。当他们发生困难的时候，政府以加工定货的方式援助他们克服了困难；现在加工定货，也仍给他们以合理的利润。而他们却忘恩负义，不顾国家和人民的利益了。有的私营厂商竟无耻地宣称：“去年春天我们在困难中，政府委托加工定货是‘雪中送炭’，我们是欢迎的；现在不需要‘锦上添花’了。”他们唯恐赚钱不够多，总想脱出新民主主义经济的正常轨道。他们不愿接受加工定货，或者接受之后用种种无耻的手段捣鬼，贪图为所欲为地投机取巧，牟取暴利。他们以为人民政府的干部是可欺的，他们以为人民政府对他们是莫可奈何的。可是，他们想错了！人民政府是决不会听任他们为所欲为的。他们如果还不悔改，就请他们看看奸商乔铭勋等人的下场吧！
    各地有关加工定货工作的部门，应该接受这些事件的痛心的教训，并对于工作中的问题进行认真的检查，对于好的经验加以系统的总结，严密制度，划清责任，在增产节约运动中，切实改进自己的工作状况，维护正确的公私关系，避免国家财产和人民利益的损失。
    奸商乔铭勋等受到国家法律的制裁，是完全罪有应得的。若干厂商对乔铭勋等曾采取互相包庇的态度，他们应该切实认清自己的错误，改邪归正。一切正当的私营工商业者应当把乔铭勋等的行为认为是最可耻的事，下定决心改变贪图暴利的投机思想；要遵守人民政府的法令，爱护祖国人民的财产，和广大人民群众站在一起，坚决同一切投机取巧追逐暴利的思想行为进行斗争！
