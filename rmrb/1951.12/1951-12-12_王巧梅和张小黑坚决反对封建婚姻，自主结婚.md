Wang Qiaomei and Zhang Xiaohei are both from Wangjiazhuang, District One, Jie County, Shanxi Province. Their families lived across from each other and have been good friends since childhood. Last year, Qiaomei was eighteen and Xiaohei was twenty. They often heard people say that parents can no longer arrange marriages, so they decided to marry freely.

Last December, their neighbor Song Xiaoan told both sets of parents about Xiaohei and Qiaomei's marriage plans. Qiaomei's parents objected. This year, on the ninth day of the sixth lunar month, Qiaomei's uncle came to visit Qiaomei's family. Qiaomei's mother asked her uncle, "Qiaomei wants to find her own partner, what do you think we should do?" Qiaomei's father interjected, "Let her stay at her uncle's house for a few days, and cool her heart down." That night, Qiaomei's father, mother, and uncle discussed and decided to betroth Qiaomei to Li Kuishan from Lijiafen Village. They hoped to get twelve *shi* of wheat, four bolts of cloth, half a *jin* of silver jewelry, and forty *jin* of cotton as betrothal gifts. The next day, Qiaomei was forced to go to her uncle's house. She stayed there for two months. Her uncle tried everything to trick Qiaomei into marrying Li Kuishan, and finally even threatened her, saying, "If you don't marry Li Kuishan, you can't go home. If you firmly disagree, your parents will wish they were dead." Qiaomei was forced to agree. On the tenth day of the eighth lunar month, her uncle sent her home. Passing by Lijiafen Village, he insisted that Qiaomei stay overnight at Li Kuishan's house. Li Kuishan's family took this opportunity to give Qiaomei a pair of bracelets, which Qiaomei reluctantly accepted. After returning home, her parents were very happy, thinking the matter was settled, and secretly prepared Qiaomei's dowry. However, on August 24th, Qiaomei quietly went to the district government with Xiaohei to register their marriage. No one stopped them, and on October 24th, Qiaomei and Xiaohei were successfully married.

    王巧梅和张小黑坚决反对封建婚姻，自主结婚
    王巧梅和张小黑，都是山西省解县一区王家庄人。他俩家住对门，从小就是好朋友。去年，巧梅十八，小黑二十。他俩常听人说，现在父母不能包办婚姻，就拿定主意，要自由结婚。
    去年十二月间，邻居宋小安把小黑、巧梅的婚事告诉了双方的父母。巧梅的父母反对。今年夏历六月初九，巧梅的舅父来巧梅家探亲。巧梅的娘问她的舅父说：“巧梅要自找对象，你说该怎么办？”巧梅的父亲插嘴说：“叫他到舅舅家住上几天，冷冷她的心再说。”那天夜里，巧梅的父、母、舅父三人商量好，把巧梅许给了李家坟村的李奎山。他们想从中得到麦子十二石、布四匹、银器半斤、棉花四十斤的聘礼。第二天，巧梅被迫到了舅父家。一直住了两月。她舅父想尽一切办法，诱骗巧梅和李奎山结婚，最后更威胁她说：“你不嫁给李奎山就回不了家。你要坚决不同意，你父母就要死的不要活的。”巧梅被迫答应了。夏历八月初十，舅父送他回家。路过李家坟村，硬叫巧梅在李奎山家住了一宿。李奎山家里借这机会，给巧梅一付镯子，巧梅勉强地收下了。回家后，她父母认为事情已办好，很高兴，便暗地里准备巧梅出嫁的东西。巧梅却在八月二十四日悄悄地和小黑到区政府办理了结婚登记手续。谁也没有阻止了她们，十月二十四日，巧梅和小黑胜利结婚了。
