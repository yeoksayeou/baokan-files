In accordance with the "Several Decisions on Ethnic Affairs" issued by the Government Administration Council on February 5, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government convened the National Ethnic Health Conference from August 23 to 30 this year. The general health situation in minority areas and the issues resolved at the conference are reported separately as follows:

	I. The Severe Situation of Population Decline

The situation of population decline among ethnic minorities is extremely serious. For example: In Heshan County, Xinjiang, there were more than 5,000 Mongolian households 20 or 30 years ago, but now only about 600 households remain; Simao County, Yunnan, had a population of 30,000 to 40,000 a decade ago, but now only has just over a hundred people; the Guoluo tribe of Tibetans in Haiyan County, Qinghai, originally had more than 200 households, but now only about 30 households remain; the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan Province had a population of 400,000 during the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, but now has less than 100,000 people. According to a survey by the Sui-Mongolia Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Team, one-third of the 568 women from the Yikezhao and Ulanqab Leagues had never given birth. It is estimated that half of the families in the entire league do not have children. As a result, the saying "more people die than are born" has spread among ethnic minorities.

	II. Major Diseases

The most harmful diseases in minority areas are the following three categories:

	A. Venereal Diseases: Among ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, Kang, Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, venereal disease patients account for about 50% of the total population. Due to the lack of medical facilities during the reactionary rule period, the spread has widened. In individual areas, the rate has reached over 90% of the population, which greatly affects the health of the local people and is a major cause of miscarriages, premature deaths, and population decline.

	B. Malaria and Other Infectious Diseases: The most serious disease among ethnic minorities in Southwest and South Central China is malaria. According to the Yunnan Province 1950 Health Work Summary Report, 64% to 94% of children in Simao, Puer, Yunxian, Shunining, Zhefang, Yuanjiang, and Hekou counties have enlarged spleens, and 39% have malaria parasites in their blood. The sharp decline in the population of Simao County is mainly caused by malaria. In the Southwest and South Central regions, the majority of ethnic minorities have had malaria and still carry the parasites. During the summer and autumn, entire villages often lose their labor force. Residents of southwestern Yunnan once had a saying due to the fear of malaria: "If you want to go to Mengding Dam, marry off your wife first; if you want to go to Gengma, buy a coffin first." The next most prevalent are dysentery, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, relapsing fever, etc., which are also infectious diseases with extremely high mortality rates. Although plague is declining year by year in Inner Mongolia, it has not yet been eradicated.

	C. Obstetric and Pediatric Diseases: Minority women do not have assistance during childbirth, and working women often give birth in the wild. People in the pastoral areas of Xinjiang believe that childbirth is an unclean thing and cannot be done at home. Before labor, they must go to the wild. During childbirth, they lay grass or old felt underneath, or even some sand and cow dung. The umbilical cord is often cut with broken pieces of bowls, bamboo, or bitten off with teeth. There are also cases of death due to bleeding because the umbilical cord is not tied off. The mortality rate of infants with tetanus, measles, and smallpox is very high. In some areas of Xinjiang, it is as high as 60% to 70%. In one district of Wuwei, Gansu, 2,700 children died of measles in one year. In a survey of 999 children in Baicheng, Xinjiang, 233 died of smallpox. Therefore, the saying "You only see the mother carrying the child, but you don't see the child walking" is prevalent among ethnic minorities.

The above are the most harmful diseases. In addition, eye diseases, parasitic diseases, rheumatism, etc., are also very common among all ethnic groups.

	III. On the Health Work in Minority Areas and Future Plans

Over the past year, the Ministry of Health has gradually begun to establish health work in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, including health institutions newly built specifically for ethnic minorities. In Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, there are 94 health centers and 24 hospitals. In Suiyuan, Northwest, Southwest, and Inner Mongolia, there are 40 medical teams. Due to the strengthening of prevention work, the incidence of plague in Inner Mongolia has been greatly reduced. The incidence rate in 1950 was only about 1.3 per thousand of the rate in 1947. The venereal disease prevention and treatment work in Inner Mongolia has achieved results in individual areas, and the birth rate is increasing. Wherever health personnel go, they are greatly welcomed by the local ethnic brothers. For example, ethnic minorities in western Yunnan repaired roads 30 to 40 li long and covered them with leaves to welcome health personnel to work. After the Tibetan people in Qinghai were cured of their illnesses, they said with emotion: "Chairman Mao's leadership has changed people's hearts for the better." However, due to limited funding and insufficient cadres, it is still impossible to carry out work universally and systematically.

In the future, the Ministry of Health plans to concentrate its main efforts on eradicating venereal diseases in the Mongolian and Tibetan regions, malaria and women and children's diseases in the ethnic minority areas of Southwest and South Central China. Based on the discussions at this ethnic health conference, we plan to take the following measures to strengthen health work in minority areas:

	1. Gradually establish health institutions: Health institutions in minority areas are extremely lacking. It is planned to gradually establish grassroots health organizations below the county level as the basis for health work. The establishment of county-level grassroots health organizations should be basically completed in 1952. Due to the scattered or mobile nature of ethnic minority settlements, it is necessary to simultaneously organize mobile medical and prevention teams or health work teams. Regarding the prevention and treatment of major diseases, it is planned to establish four malaria prevention and treatment centers in Southwest and South Central China in 1952 (each currently has one), and the central government will send two malaria prevention and treatment teams; one venereal disease prevention and treatment station will be set up in each of Xikang, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, and the work of the prevention and treatment stations in Xinjiang and Suiyuan will be strengthened.

In areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, in order to strengthen the leadership of health work, it is planned to set up specialized management agencies to strengthen leadership, and under the leadership of local administrative leaders, to organize mass organizations for the prevention and treatment of major diseases, such as venereal disease prevention associations, anti-malaria associations, etc., and to strengthen ethnic-style health propaganda work.

	2. Equip and train health cadres: Ethnic minorities mostly live in border areas, and there is an extreme shortage of health cadres. In addition to deciding to mobilize a group of health cadres from the inland to work in ethnic minority areas, and to recruit ethnic minority youth to study in higher and intermediate medical colleges in the inland, it is planned to establish short-term training courses for primary health cadres and a few higher and intermediate medical colleges in ethnic minority areas with the necessary conditions. The specific plan will be reported separately.

	3. Implement charging, fee reduction, or free treatment based on the actual conditions of different regions and diseases: Due to the long-term extortion and devastation of ethnic minority areas by reactionary rule, certain classes have special difficulties in their lives. Therefore, at present, health agencies in various ethnic areas must, according to the economic conditions of the local people, consult with political power organs and people's representatives to determine specific methods for charging, fee reduction, and free treatment. For syphilis treatment, free treatment must be the main focus in order to gradually achieve universal treatment and better results.

	4. Require leaders to be responsible: Health work is one of the primary tasks in ethnic minority areas. Administrative leaders in ethnic minority areas must personally take the lead in order to first stop the serious phenomena of population decline and disease spread.

     中央人民政府卫生部关于全国少数民族卫生会议的报告
    （一九五一年十一月二十三日贺诚副部长在政务院第一百一十二次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    遵照政务院二月五日发布的“关于民族事务的几项决定”，中央卫生部在本年八月二十三日至三十日召开了全国民族卫生会议。兹将少数民族地区的一般卫生情况和在会议上解决的问题，分别报告如下：
        一、人口减少的严重情况
    少数民族人口减少的状况极端严重，如：新疆河山县二、三十年前原有蒙族五千余户，现在只剩六百余户；云南思茅县城十余年前有三、四万人口，现在只有一百余人；青海海晏县藏族的果洛部落原有二百余户，现在只剩三十余户；绥远省伊克昭盟在清乾隆时代有四十万人口，现在不足十万人。据绥蒙性病防治队调查：五六八名伊克昭、乌兰察布两盟妇女，其中三分之一没有生育过，估计全盟一半的家庭没有小孩。因而在少数民族中流传出“生的没有死的多”的话。二、主要的疾病
    在少数民族地区危害最烈的疾病为下列三类：
    甲、性病：性病患者，在内蒙、康、藏、青海、新疆地区民族中，约占全人口百分之五十左右。由于反动统治时期，几乎毫无医药设施，以致蔓延日广，个别地区有高达人口百分之九十以上者，影响当地人民的健康甚大，为流产、夭折以致人口减少的主要原因。
    乙、疟疾和其他传染病：在西南、中南少数民族中最严重者为疟疾。据云南省一九五○年卫生工作总结报告：思茅、普洱、云县、顺宁、遮放、元江、河口等县儿童有脾肿者占百分之六十四至九十四，血液中含疟原虫者占百分之三十九。思茅县人口之急剧下降主要为疟疾所致。西南与中南地区，少数民族中患过疟疾并保有原虫者占人口的大多数，夏、秋季中常使整个村庄失去劳动力。滇西南区居民因恐惧疟疾曾流传一句俗语：“要下孟定坝，先把老婆嫁；要到耿马，先把棺材买下”。其次为痢疾、流行性脑脊髓膜炎、白喉、猩红热、伤寒、回归热等，也都是死亡率极大的传染病。鼠疫在内蒙地区虽然在逐年缩减中，但仍未消灭。
    丙、产妇科和小儿科的疾病：少数民族妇女产期没有人助产，劳动妇女常在野外生孩子。新疆游牧区人民习惯，认为生产是不干净的事情，不能在家里生产，临产前必须到野外去，产时下面铺草堆或旧毡子，甚至铺些沙子牛粪，脐带多用碎碗片、竹片或用齿咬断，亦有因不结扎脐带而流血致死的。婴儿患破伤风、麻疹和天花的死亡率很大。在新疆某些地区高达百分之六十到百分之七十。甘肃武威一个区的小孩，一年内患麻疹而死亡的，就有二千七百名。新疆拜城城乡调查九百九十九名儿童死亡中，有二百三十三名死于天花。故少数民族中流传出“只见娘怀儿，不见儿走路”的话。
    以上是危害最大的疾病，此外如眼病、寄生虫病、风湿病等，在各族同胞中亦甚普遍。
        三、关于少数民族地区的
        卫生工作情况和今后计划
    一年来卫生部在少数民族居住地区已逐步的开始建立了卫生工作，计专为少数民族恢复和新建的卫生机构。在青海、内蒙、新疆地区有卫生院九十四所、医院二十四所；在绥远、西北、西南、内蒙地区有医疗队四十队。由于预防工作加强，内蒙的鼠疫发病率已大为减少。一九五○年的发病率，约只等于一九四七年的千分之一·三。内蒙的性病防治工作在个别地区，已收得成效，生育率已在增加。卫生人员所到之处，大受当地兄弟民族的欢迎，如滇西少数民族曾将三、四十里长的道路修好，铺上树叶，欢迎卫生人员前往工作；青海藏民在病治好之后，感动的说：“毛主席领导得人心都变好了。”但因限于经费和干部的不够，还不能普遍地、有系统地进行工作。
    今后卫生部拟集中主要力量扑灭蒙藏地区的性病，西南、中南各少数民族地区的疟疾及妇幼疾病。根据这次民族卫生会议讨论，我们拟采取以下办法来加强少数民族地区的卫生工作。
    一、逐步地建立卫生机构：少数民族地区卫生机构极端缺乏，拟逐步建立县级以下的卫生基层组织，作为卫生工作的基础。县一级卫生基层组织应在一九五二年内基本完成，由于少数民族居住分散或流动不定，必须同时组织巡回医防队或卫生工作队。关于主要疾病的防治，准备一九五二年在西南与中南各成立疟疾防治所四所（现各有一所），并由中央派遣两个疟疾防治队；在西康、甘、宁、青、内蒙各设一性病防治站，并加强新疆、绥远防治站工作。
    在少数民族聚居地区，为加强卫生工作的领导，拟设专门的管理机构，以便加强领导，并在当地行政首长领导之下，组织防治主要疾病的群众团体，如性病防治协会、防疟协会等，加强民族形式的卫生宣传工作。
    二、配备与培养卫生干部：少数民族多聚居边疆地区，卫生干部异常缺乏。除决定即由内地动员一批卫生干部去少数民族地区工作，并招收少数民族知识青年到内地高、中级医学院校学习外，拟在有条件的少数民族地区创办初级卫生干部的短期训练班及少数高级、中级的医学院校。其具体计划另报。
    三、分别地区及疾病的实际情况，实行收费、减费、或免费治疗：少数民族地区由于长期受反动统治的敲诈、摧残，某些阶层在生活上有其特殊的困难，因此，目前各民族地区卫生机关得根据当地人民的经济状况，协同政权机关、人民代表商定收费、减费及免费的具体办法，对于梅毒治疗，则必须以免费为主，以便于逐渐普遍治疗，更好地收到成效。
    四、要求首长负责：卫生工作是少数民族地区首要工作之一，少数民族地区行政首长，必须亲自加以领导，以期首先停止人口减少疾病蔓延的严重现象。
