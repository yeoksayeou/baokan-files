    The Experience of Anti-Bureaucracy Should Be Promoted Nationwide

    After seeing the anti-bureaucracy document exhibition, we have a deeper understanding and vigilance regarding the harm of bureaucracy. We realize that this problem is prevalent in various organizations, seriously affecting the improvement of work efficiency and causing great losses to the people's cause. Based on some examples revealed in the exhibition, we believe that the reasons for the emergence of bureaucracy in organizations are the inappropriate work style of leaders, the organizational structure, and the division of responsibilities. If the work style of the leaders is bureaucratic, the organizational structure is overly complex, and the responsible cadres at all levels do not divide responsibilities, the time it takes for official documents to circulate will be delayed to an intolerable length.

    We fully agree with the instructions given by Vice Premier Dong in his inscription for the exhibition, and we support the simplification of official document procedures in government organizations. We will resolutely wage a relentless struggle against bureaucracy and strive to fully implement this convention. We hope that through this exhibition, in coordination with the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the heads of various organizations will personally take action to conduct an in-depth inspection, reduce unnecessary official document procedures and organizational levels, so that organizations, systems, and staff can be rationally arranged and utilized, and government organizations can function like factories, unleashing their work potential. For government organizations, improving work efficiency is equivalent to increasing production. We also hope that the experiences of this exhibition will be summarized and introduced to major administrative regions and key cities, launching a widespread anti-bureaucracy movement.

    应该把反文牍主义的经验推广到全国去
    看过反文牍主义公文展览会后，我们对文牍主义的害处，有了进一步的认识和警惕。我们认识到这一问题是在各机关中普遍存在着的，它严重地影响工作效率的提高，给人民事业带来很大的损失。根据展览会中揭露的一些例子，我们认为：机关中产生文牍主义的原因，是领导者的工作作风、编制的层次以及分层负责这三方面有不妥当的地方。如果领导者的工作作风有官僚主义，编制的层次过分复杂，各级的负责干部不分层负责，就会使公文的旅行时间，拖延到不可容忍的长度。
    我们完全同意董副总理在给展览会的题词中所作的指示，拥护机关简化公文的手续。我们将坚决向文牍主义作无情的斗争，为彻底实现这个公约而努力。我们希望通过这次展览会，配合反贪污浪费，反官僚主义运动，由各机关首长亲自动手，来一次深入检查，减少那些不必要的公文手续、不必要的组织层次，使组织、制度和工作人员得到合理的安排和运用，使政府机关像工厂一样，能够发挥工作的潜力。就政府机关来说，提高工作效率就是增产。我们并希望把这次展览会的经验加以总结，介绍到各大行政区及重点城市，掀起一个广泛的反文牍主义的运动。
