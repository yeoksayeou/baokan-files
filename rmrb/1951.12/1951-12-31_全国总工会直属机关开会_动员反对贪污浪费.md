Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: The directly subordinate organs of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a mobilization meeting on December 23rd to oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Vice-Chairman Liu Ningyi delivered a mobilization report at the meeting.

Liu Ningyi pointed out: Some people think that there is only waste and bureaucracy in the trade union, not corruption. This is not right. Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are interrelated. Judging from the facts that have been revealed so far, the phenomenon of corruption and waste in the national trade union system is very serious. According to current incomplete statistics, losses caused by corruption amount to as much as 5.99587 billion yuan.

Liu Ningyi emphasized: We must first set an example in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and earnestly and thoroughly examine ourselves. Then, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we must mobilize the workers of the whole country to rigorously rectify our ranks in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. He then proposed that in order to smoothly carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, everyone should abide by the following principles: 1. Leaders take responsibility and take action personally; 2. Speakers are not guilty, accusers are not investigated, and those who suppress democracy must be punished; 3. For corrupt elements who confess voluntarily, serious crimes can be reduced, minor crimes can be exempted, and those who do not confess and are exposed by others will be punished more severely; 4. Organize inspection teams to inspect each other, and lower levels can inspect higher levels; 5. Those who are honest and upright, consistently simple in their style, and who insist on fighting against corruption and waste should be commended, and those who boldly expose and report corrupt and wasteful elements in the movement should be encouraged.

Finally, Liu Ningyi called on everyone to carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to the workers across the country, making it a broad mass movement.

    全国总工会直属机关开会
    动员反对贪污浪费
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华全国总工会直属机关在二十三日举行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义动员大会，刘宁一副主席在会上作了动员报告。
    刘宁一指出：有的人以为工会中只有浪费和官僚主义，没有贪污，这是不对的。贪污、浪费、官僚主义是相互关联的。就目前已揭发出的事实看来，全国工会系统中贪污浪费现象是十分严重的。根据现在不完全的统计，因贪污而造成的损失即有人民币五十九亿九千五百八十七万元之多。
    刘宁一强调说：我们首先要在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中以身作则，认真地彻底地检查自己；然后在共产党的领导下，把全国工人动员起来，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中严格地整顿自己的队伍。他接着提出，为了顺利地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，大家要遵守下面几条：一、首长负责、亲自动手；二、言者无罪，告者不究，压制民主者必办；三、对自动坦白的贪污分子，重罪可以减轻，轻罪可以免罪，不坦白被人揭发者加重处分；四、组织检查队相互检查，下级可以检查上级；五、对于廉洁奉公、一贯作风朴素、并坚持与贪污浪费行为作斗争的人，应予以表扬，对在运动中大胆揭发检举贪污浪费分子的应予以鼓励。
    最后，刘宁一号召大家要把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动贯彻到全国工人中去，使它成为广泛的群众性的运动。
