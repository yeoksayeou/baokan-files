    Taiyuan Worker Accommodation Problems Are Still Very Serious Today. What is the Main Reason?
    Chang Jiang
    I. The Terrible Situation of Worker Accommodation in Taiyuan
    Taiyuan is an expanding industrial city. In the past two years, factories and workers have continued to increase. The city's population was 240,000 in 1949 and has now increased to over 500,000, with workers and their families accounting for about 200,000, including more than 40,000 industrial workers, and about 100,000 including their families. After two years of work, especially after the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the adjustment of wages and democratic reforms, the restoration and transformation of industry has made great achievements, and the workers' political sentiment is very high, and their enthusiasm for production is great. The workers' material life, in terms of food and clothing, has improved significantly. However, the housing situation of industrial workers is still very bad today. Solving the minimum housing problem is the most urgent demand of the majority of workers in Taiyuan today.
    According to a survey at the end of November this year, the dormitories originally owned and newly built by various factories and mines in Taiyuan generally only solved about 20% to 30% of the accommodation needs of the workers in each factory and mine. The vast majority of the remaining workers rely on renting private houses. The quality of rented private houses is generally very bad, and the quantity is extremely lacking.
    I once investigated a mixed residential area of heavy industrial workers outside the North and South Gates of Taiyuan. Most of the houses here are dilapidated small adobe houses. The workers describe them like this: "It rains heavily outside the house, and it drizzles inside the house; when it stops raining outside, it still rains inside!" Therefore, collapses occur frequently; some are barely maintained, and there is also a danger of collapse from time to time. For example, Zhang Runyao, an old fitter and miller at a factory with 26 years of service, now lives in a house that is barely supported by a few pieces of wood. During the rainy season, if it rains, many workers cannot concentrate on production in the factory. They are worried about their homes leaking, wetting the quilts, and some are afraid that the house will collapse and crush their wives and children. Comrades from the Taiyuan Beiguan Public Security Sub-bureau told me that some houses were so bad and dirty that some public security personnel with a weak mass perspective were unwilling to enter these workers' houses to carry out household registration work in the past. But now, the bad condition of the houses is not the biggest problem. The bigger problem is that such bad houses are still very scarce. Therefore, even more terrible phenomena are appearing everywhere. For example, Zhang Hongjiang, a locomotive worker at a railway factory with nine years of service, lives in a small room with his mother, wife, and daughter. Two couples, including Xu Fusuo, a raw material worker at a steel factory, live in a small room, separated only by paper. A small toilet now houses six people, including Zhang Zhenyuan from the riveting department of a factory. It is a common phenomenon for dozens of single workers to squeeze into one room. In addition to two horses, a stable houses three workers from the 647 Factory, including Zhao Youfu, and Ma Chaoxiang's family of four, who drives a cart. In addition, some small restaurants also accommodate workers at night, and factory workers often stay in small inns. Is the accommodation situation for workers better outside Beiguan? According to the survey, the situation for workers who do not live in factory dormitories is similar. Even workers who already live in their own factory dormitories face difficult situations because of the shortage of dormitories. For example, in a broken bathroom in the Guchengcun dormitory of a steel factory, four couples, including steelworker Zhang Zhongxiu, and their children live there. The bathroom is ten meters long and six meters wide, with two doors and one window. The four families have divided the bathroom, and one family enters and exits through the bathroom window. For example, in room 11 of dormitory No. 8 in Guchengcun, the coke worker Hu Meiguang's family of three lives there, and seven other single male workers also live in this room. At a coal mine, 250 pairs of worker couples live in 123 rooms. In other words, there are many families where two couples or even other members live in one room, and some where three couples live in one room. The above does not include construction workers living in temporary shacks, whose situation is even worse. Some factory and mine workers cannot find accommodation near the urban area, so they are assigned to live in villages ten, twenty, or even thirty miles away; this makes it even more inconvenient to go to and from work, and greatly hinders production and learning.
    II. Extravagance and Waste are the Main Reasons Why the Taiyuan Worker Accommodation Problem is Still Serious
    Given the country's still difficult financial situation, it is impossible to completely solve the worker dormitory problem now. However, the fact that the Taiyuan worker accommodation problem is still so serious in the winter of 1951 is, for the most part, that the state's investment in this area in the past two years has been largely wasted by extravagance and waste. Therefore, the newly built dormitories can only solve the problems of a very small number of people. Secondly, for local factories and mines, some are still economically difficult, and some still do not pay enough attention to this issue. When local factories and mines build dormitories,
    Generally relatively simple. However, with further savings, more dormitories can be built.
    Most of the newly built dormitories in various state-owned factories and enterprises in Taiyuan are too extravagant, except for a few that are relatively simple and suitable for the northern climate. These dormitories are basically built according to the ideal of "garden bungalows." Generally, each family has one bedroom, one living room, and one kitchen; slightly higher-level dormitories have two bedrooms, one living room, one toilet, one storage room, and one kitchen, and even prepare a single bathroom. Generally, there are very large and many glass windows, beautiful paint, and some houses use very thick Northeast pine wood for the floor, and other parts of the house also use a lot of very high-grade wood. Outside these houses, there is generally a wide open space for planting flowers and trees. In the situation of such housing difficulties, except for the relatively low-level dormitories that have been occupied, some of the higher-level dormitories that have been completed are still empty. Because on the one hand, the rent is too expensive, with each family having to bear a burden of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per month, and another important reason is that many people cannot afford to install so many stoves in a dormitory in winter. In this way, not only ordinary workers, but also many higher-level staff cannot afford to live there. The construction cost of these houses is generally very high. If the materials used for these houses (including allocated timber) and labor are calculated at current market prices, how much money will the state have to spend to solve the housing problem of an employee's family? Taking only the seven types of dormitories completed in the four state-owned factories in Taiyuan City, the first type of dormitory costs 114 million yuan, the second type costs 106 million yuan, the third type costs 78 million yuan, the fourth type costs 52 million yuan, and even the more economical type costs 14 million yuan.
    Is it necessary to spend so much money in Taiyuan to solve the worker dormitory problem? The fact is not so. A very economical and practical employee dormitory has emerged in the state-owned enterprises in Taiyuan. This is the ordinary "bungalow" in the rural areas of Hebei and Shanxi, basically similar to the houses lived in by the Party Central Committee in Xibaipo Village, Jianping County, northwest of Shijiazhuang in 1948. The cost of building a bungalow is 3.48 million yuan per room. Assuming that an average of one family lives in one room, the cost per family is one-thirtieth of the first type of house. In the atmosphere of the "garden bungalow" prevailing, Comrade Chen Xin, director of the Taiyuan Engineering Office of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, is the one who advocated building this economical dormitory and has initially implemented it within his jurisdiction. If the "garden bungalows" in Taiyuan were converted into bungalows according to Comrade Chen Xin's method, how many employee dormitories could be solved? I don't have the materials for the construction cost of all the new dormitories and other ancillary equipment in Taiyuan. Based only on the materials of the seven types of dormitories completed in the above-mentioned four state-owned factories (excluding other ancillary equipment), only 1,782 families can live according to their original way of living; if these investments are used to rebuild "bungalows," one family per room, 18,329 families can live, which is more than ten times the former. Of course, some families with large populations need to live in two or three bungalows, but in any case, using economical dormitories is much better than the past. According to the materials of the Taiyuan Municipal Construction Bureau, in addition to the approximately 12,700 rooms originally owned, purchased, and newly built for industrial worker dormitories in Taiyuan, there is still a shortage of 28,000 rooms. Therefore, if most of the investment in newly built dormitories and factory ancillary equipment in the past two years had been used to build "bungalows," plus the construction costs that can obviously be saved in other aspects of Taiyuan, the hardship endured by the Taiyuan workers (especially the industrial system) would have been largely resolved.
    Therefore, there is a struggle between two lines in the construction of Taiyuan worker dormitories. One is a fundamentally extravagant and wasteful approach, and the other is an economical approach. Because the extravagant and wasteful approach has not been criticized and stopped, it has prevailed in the past two years, thus prolonging the suffering of the Taiyuan workers in terms of accommodation. III. Criticism of Various Erroneous Ideas
    On the issue of worker accommodation in Taiyuan, many comrades do not advocate the economical approach that can quickly solve the problem, but in essence, adopt an extravagant and wasteful approach, which has its ideological basis.
    Some people misunderstand the so-called "century-long plan" thinking. Their request to achieve the "socialist standard" in the worker dormitory problem under the current conditions is an unrealistic view. Because, the urgent problem for the broad masses of workers today is not to live in "villas," but to have "ordinary houses" that can shelter from the wind and rain and prevent two or three couples or parents-in-law and daughters-in-law from living in one room. As it is now, a small number of people live in good dormitories, and the majority of workers live in dilapidated small adobe houses, stables, toilets, small restaurants, and small inns, with hundreds of couples living together in one room, which is a shocking and backward life, where is the "socialism"? Taking the workers who have already moved into villas, many lack sufficient bedding and curtains, etc., which makes them very difficult. So some workers say: "It's good, but it's too cold and too bright." Of course, in the construction of factory buildings and important production equipment, the "century-long plan" policy should be implemented, but some of our comrades have not yet considered this aspect thoroughly.
    Some people also say that building bungalows is "uneconomical" and "unaesthetic." The reason for "uneconomical" is that these houses have a short lifespan; the reason for "unaesthetic" is that they are incompatible with large factory buildings and the situation after the victory of the revolution, and that they have some "retro" flavor. These reasons are untenable. First, let's talk about aesthetics. Is it "unaesthetic" for workers to have "bungalows" to live in? Is it "aesthetic" for two or three couples to live in one room? Is it a "reformer"? As for "economic" or "uneconomic," it is also a one-sided view. Bungalows can at least be lived in for ten or eight years. Now that the workers are living well, and everyone is happily producing and learning, the national economic situation will improve in ten years, and it will not be uneconomical to demolish and rebuild them? Is it "economic" for workers to hinder production because of poor accommodation?
    Some people also say: "If the dormitories are not good, Shanghai employees will not be willing to come." There is some truth in this, but it is not the fundamental reason. First of all, in Shanghai, ordinary workers and junior staff do not generally live in garden bungalows. A small number of senior technicians can of course be taken care of better. In terms of living habits, Shanghai workers and northern workers are certainly different, and Shanghai workers cannot be required to sleep on heated kang beds. However, the main conditions for mobilizing Shanghai workers to Shanxi are suitable work, appropriate wages, and full political mobilization, and dormitories are not the decisive factor. Taiyuan has five months of cold weather every year, and cold protection is a major issue. Many Shanghai workers in Taiyuan now understand this truth. I once visited the families of Shanghai carpenters Huang Shengting and bricklayers Shen Jinsheng in the "bungalow" residential area of the Taiyuan Engineering Office of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry outside Xiaodongmen, and asked them what they thought of the "bungalows" they lived in. They said: "It's very warm here, much better than on the construction site!"
    IV. Suggestions for Improvement
    So what should be done in the future? I think it should be like this:
    First, the relevant ministries of the central government should stipulate that from 1952, factories and mines in Taiyuan can no longer arbitrarily build "garden bungalow" style dormitories and other ancillary equipment; the state's new investment in worker dormitories and ancillary equipment should be strictly built according to the principle of frugality. Factories and mines with the conditions to build adobe kilns should promote the construction of more adobe kilns, and strive to meet the needs of worker accommodation as much as possible. The dormitories for a small number of senior engineering and technical personnel can be better.
    Second, the currently allocated dormitories and unaccommodated dormitories should be used as much as possible. Except for a small number of senior technicians, senior factory managers, and employees with large families, who should live in two or three rooms, it should be advocated that two or three families live together in dormitories with two or three rooms. In fact, the workers themselves have created this method. For example, in a dormitory of eight families in a steel factory, the workers have automatically changed six of them into twelve families.
    Third, some provincial-owned factories and mines should allocate certain funds under the conditions of production development to solve the problem of worker dormitories. The worst phenomena should be improved within a time limit.
    Fourth, a responsible attitude should also be taken towards the accommodation of temporary workers, and certain conditions should be guaranteed.
    Fifth, the Shanxi and Taiyuan local party and government organs should inspect the worker accommodation situation of various factories and mines in Taiyuan, and implement policy guidance and supervision on the construction and distribution of worker dormitories in various factories and mines.

    太原工人住宿问题今天仍然十分严重的主要原因在那里？
    长江
    一、太原工人住宿问题的恶劣情况
    太原是正在扩大的工业城市。两年来，工厂和工人不断增加。全市人口一九四九年是二十四万，现在已增加到五十万以上，工人及其家属约占二十万，其中产业工人计四万多人，连家属约十万人。在两年工作之后，特别在抗美援朝、镇压反革命以及调整工资和民主改革之后，工业的恢复和改造有很大成绩，工人的政治情绪很高，生产积极性很大。工人物质生活中的吃穿两项，有了显著的改善。但产业工人住宿状况，现在仍十分恶劣。解决最低限度的住宿问题，是今天太原大多数工人最迫切的要求。
    根据本年十一月底调查，太原各厂矿自己原有和新修的宿舍，一般说来，只解决了各厂矿工人住宿需要的百分之二十至百分之三十左右。其余的工人绝大多数依靠租赁民房住宿。出租民房的质量一般很坏，而且数量万分缺乏。
    我曾经调查过太原大小北门外城关一带的重工业工人混合居住区。这里的房子大半是些破烂不堪的小土屋，工人们这样地形容它们：“屋外下大雨，屋里下小雨；屋外停了雨，屋里还下雨！”因而经常发生坍塌事故；有些勉强维持，也时有坍塌危险。例如有二十六年工龄的某厂老钳工和铣工张润耀现在住的房子，就是用几根木头勉强撑着的。在雨季里，如果天下雨，许多工人在工厂内就不能安心生产，他们顾虑家里漏雨，打湿被子，有些又怕房子倒，压坏自己的老婆孩子。太原北关公安分局的同志告诉我：有些房子实在太坏、太脏，过去曾有个别群众观点不强的公安人员不愿进这些工人住房内去进行户籍工作。但是，现在，房子坏还不是最大的问题，更大的问题，是这样的坏房子还很缺。因而更恶劣的现象，就到处出现了。例如有九年工龄的铁路工厂的铁路机关车工人张鸿江，他和母亲、妻子、女儿住在一个小房里。有一个小房里住了某钢铁厂原料工续福锁等两对夫妇，中间仅用纸隔开。有一间原来的小厕所，现在住着某厂铆工部张振远等六个人。十几二十个单身工人挤在一间房内是普遍的现象。一家马房里，除两匹马外，住着六四七厂的赵有福等三个工人，还有赶大车的马超祥一家四口。此外，有些小饭馆晚上也住工人，小客栈里也常住工厂工人。北关外，工人住宿情形是不是好一些？据调查，没有工厂宿舍住的工人，情形是差不多的。就是已经住在自己厂矿宿舍里的工人，因宿舍不足，有些处境也很困难。例如某钢铁厂古城村宿舍一个坏了的浴室里，住着炼铁工人张忠秀等四对夫妇和他们的子女。这个浴室十公尺长、六公尺宽，计有两个门，一个窗。四家人把浴室分割了，有一家是从浴室窗上进出的。又如古城村八号宿舍十一号房内，住有炼焦工人胡美光夫妇一家三口人，同时另外有七个单身男工人也住在这个房内。某煤矿，有二百五十对工人夫妇共住一百二十三间房子。换句话说，就是有许多家庭是两对夫妇甚至还有其他成员住在一间房内的，还有些是三对夫妇住在一间房内的。上面还没有算在临时工棚内住宿的建筑工人在内，他们的情形还更糟。有些厂矿工人在城区附近实在找不到住宿的地方，就分到四周一二十里甚至三十里以外的乡村居住；这样，上下工更不方便，生产和学习都受极大妨害。
    二、铺张浪费是太原工人住宿
        问题仍然严重的主要原因
    在国家财政还很困难的情形下，要求在现在完满解决工人宿舍问题是不可能的。但是，太原工人住宿问题到一九五一年冬季还这样严重，就主要部分、即国营工厂来说，基本上已不是因为国家财政困难，无力投资于工人宿舍，而主要是国家两年来在这方面的投资，大部分被铺张浪费掉了。因而新建宿舍只能解决很少一部分人的问题。就次要部分说、即就地方厂矿说，有些是经济还很困难，有些也还是不够重视这个问题。地方厂矿建筑宿舍时，
    一般比较朴素。不过，再加以节约，还可以多修一些宿舍。
    太原各国营工厂企业新建的宿舍，除少数比较朴素并合于北方气候条件外，大多数都太铺张了。这些宿舍基本上是按“花园洋房”的理想来修建的。普通是，每家有一间卧室、一间客室、一个厨房；稍高一级的，并有两间卧室，一个客室、一个厕所、一个储藏室、一个厨房，甚至还准备有单人浴室。一般是很大很多的玻璃窗、漂亮的油漆，有些房屋用了很厚的东北松木作地板，房屋的其他部分，也用了很多很高级的木料。这些房屋外面，一般留有很宽的空地，作为种花木之用。在房屋这样困难的情形下，除比较低级的宿舍已住人外，现在有些已完工的较高级宿舍还空着没有人去住。因为一则房租太贵，每家每月要十几万元至二十几万元的负担，另一个重要的原因，是许多人在冬天在一个宿舍内安不起这样多的火炉子。这样，不仅是一般工人，有些较高级的职员也有很多人住不起。这些房子的建筑费用一般是很大的，如果把这些房屋所使用的材料（包括调拨木材）、人工、按现行市价计算，则国家要花多少钱才能解决一个职工家庭的住宿问题呢？仅就太原市内四个国营工厂内已完工的七种宿舍来说，第一种宿舍要一亿一千四百万元，第二种要一亿零六百万元，第三种要七千八百万元，第四种要五千二百万元，比较节约的也得一千四百万元。
    是不是在太原一定要花这样多的钱才能解决工人宿舍问题呢？事实不是这样。太原的国营企业中已经出现了一种十分节约而且合用的职工宿舍。这就是河北山西农村中普通的“平房”，基本上和党中央一九四八年在石家庄西北的建屏县西柏坡村所住的房子差不多。平房的造价每间是三百四十八万元。平均以一间房住一个家庭计，则每家的费用，为第一种房子的三十分之一。在“花园洋房”空气流行的情况下，主张建筑这种节约的宿舍，而且在自己管辖范围内已经初步实行起来的是中央重工业部基本建设局太原工程处主任陈新同志。如果按陈新同志的办法，把太原的“花园洋房”都折算成平房，可以解决多少职工的宿舍问题呢？我现在还没有太原全部新建宿舍及工厂其他附属设备的建筑成本的材料，仅根据上述四个国营工厂中已完工的七种宿舍（其他附属设备未计入）的材料计算，照他们原来的住法，只可以住一千七百八十二家；如用这些投资改建“平房”，每房一家，可住一万八千三百二十九家，等于前者的十倍以上。当然，有些人口多的家庭，要住两三间平房，但是，无论怎样，用节约宿舍，比过去那样要好得很多。据太原市政府建设局的材料，太原产业工人宿舍，除原有、购置和新建共约一万二千七百间外，现尚欠二万八千间。所以，如果两年来大部新建宿舍及工厂附属设备投资都修成“平房”，再加上太原其他方面显然可以节约的建筑费用，太原工人群众（首先是产业系统）现在所忍受的那种艰苦的情况，至少已经大部分得到解决了。
    所以，在修建太原工人宿舍问题上，是存在着两条路线的斗争的。一种实质上是铺张浪费的方针，一种是节约的方针。由于铺张浪费方针没有受到批判和制止，它在两年来占了上风，因而延长了太原工人群众在住宿问题上的痛苦。三、各种错误思想的批判
    在太原工人住宿问题上，许多同志之所以不主张用节约的能迅速解决问题的方针，而实质上采取了铺张浪费的方针，是有他们的思想基础的。
    有些人误解了所谓“百年大计”的思想。他们在现在条件下要求在工人宿舍问题上实现“社会主义的标准”，是脱离实际的看法。因为，广大工人群众今天迫切的问题，不是要“洋房”住，而是要有可蔽风雨不至于两三对夫妇或公公媳妇住在一间房内的“普通房子”住。照现在这样，少数人住了好宿舍，大多数工人住在破烂的小土屋、马棚、厕所、小饭铺、小客栈里，成百对夫妇过着两对甚至三对共住一间房的生活，这是惊人的落后的生活，那里是什么“社会主义”呢？就拿已经住到洋房的工人说，很多人缺乏足够的被褥和窗幔等，弄得十分为难。所以有些工人说：“好是好，就是太冷、太亮。”当然，在工厂的厂房建筑及重要生产设备上，是应实行“百年大计”方针的，而我们有些同志在这方面却考虑得还不周到。
    又有人说：修平房“不经济”，且“不雅观”。“不经济”的理由是：这种房子寿命短；“不雅观”是说：和大的厂房和革命胜利以后的形势不相称，认为有些“复古”的味道。这种理由，都是站不住脚的。先说雅观不雅观，工人有“平房”住，叫作“不雅观”，难道两三对夫妇住在一间房内，反而“雅观”？反而是“革新派”？至于“经济”不“经
    济”，也是片面的观点。平房至少也能住上十年八年。现在能把工人住好，大家高高兴兴地生产和学习，十年之后，国家经济情况好转了，拆了再修，有什么不经济？难道工人因住宿不好，妨害了生产，反而“经济”？
    还有些人说：“宿舍不好，上海职工不肯来。”这个话有一部分的道理，不是根本的道理。首先因为，在上海，普通工人和下级职员并不是一般都住花园洋房的。少数高级技术人员当然可以照顾好一些。在生活习惯上，上海工人和北方工人当然不同，不能要求上海工人睡热炕。但是，动员上海工人到山西的主要条件是适当的工作，适当的工资和充分的政治动员，宿舍不是决定的因素。太原每年有五个月的冷天，防寒是一个大问题，现在太原的上海工人有不少已经懂得这一条真理了。我曾经到前述小东门外中央重工业部基本建设局太原工程处的“平房”住宅区去访问上海木工黄圣亭和瓦工沈金生等的家属，问他们对于所住“平房”有什么感想，他们说：“这里很暖和，比在工地里好得多！”
    四、改善情况的建议
    那么以后应当怎样办？我以为应当这样：
    第一、中央有关各部应规定：一九五二年起，太原各厂矿不能再随便修“花园洋房”式的宿舍及其他附属设备；国家对于工人宿舍及附属设备的新的投资，应严格按节约原则来修建。有打土窑条件的厂矿，应提倡多打土窑，争取尽可能多地满足工人住宿的需要。对少数高级工程技术人员的宿舍，可以好一些。
    第二、现在已分配的宿舍和未住宿舍，应尽量调剂使用。除少数高级技术人员、高级工厂管理人员及家庭人口众多的职工，应住二间或三间房屋外，对于有两间或三间房屋的宿舍，应提倡两家或三家人合住。事实上，工人群众已自己创造了这种办法。例如某钢铁厂有一处八家宿舍，工人已自动地把其中六家改为十二家了。
    第三、某些省营厂矿应在生产发展的条件下，拨付一定的资金，来解决工人宿舍问题。太恶劣的现象，应限期加以改善。
    第四、对临时工的住宿问题，亦应采取负责态度，保证其一定的条件。
    第五、山西和太原地方党政机关，对于太原各厂矿的工人住宿状况应加以检查，对各厂矿工人宿舍兴建及其分配，应实行方针性的领导和监督。
