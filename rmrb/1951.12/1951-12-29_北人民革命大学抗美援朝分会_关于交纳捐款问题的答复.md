    North China People's Revolutionary University Resist America, Aid Korea Branch
    Reply Regarding Donation Payment Issues

    Based on the commentary "Pay Attention to the Work of Paying and Receiving Donations for Weapons" in the 36th issue of the People's Daily's Resist America, Aid Korea special edition on September 23, we inspected our school's payment work and found some problems that require the following explanation:

    Because we did not study in advance the instructions of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China regarding the dedication of funds to be "promptly concentrated and quickly used," we only paid attention to strictly verifying the figures in the payment work. After some units made payments, the bank immediately issued receipts; other units used passbook forms in the name of small units within the school or the Resist America, Aid Korea organization to submit the funds to the bank (according to inquiries with our school's bank, these funds have been actually used and reported to the higher-level bank). This is not completely appropriate in terms of procedures. This is our shortcoming. However, in our minds, it is clear that this is a donation for Resist America, Aid Korea, not an ordinary deposit. Both the People's Bank and our school's Resist America, Aid Korea branch believe that the donation was paid into the bank, has no interest, and has been actually used. Therefore, the statement in the commentary that our school's donations "were not submitted in a timely manner, but deposited in the bank in our own name" is likely to cause misunderstanding.

    北人民革命大学抗美援朝分会
    关于交纳捐款问题的答复
    我们根据九月二十三日人民日报三十六期抗美援朝专刊“重视捐献武器的交款收款工作”的时评，检查了我校的交款工作，发现一些问题，须作如下说明：
    我们由于事先没有研究抗美援朝总会和中国人民银行总行关于献款“及时集中，迅速使用”的指示，因而在交款工作中，只注意了严格核对数字。有的单位交款后，银行即给予收据；有的单位则以校内小单位或抗美援朝组织的名义，使用了存折的形式，把款送交银行（据询问我校银行，这款项已实际使用，并向上级银行报告过），这在手续上是不够完全妥善的。这是我们的缺点。但是，在我们思想上都明确这是抗美援朝的献款，而不是普通的存款，人民银行和我校抗美援朝分会双方都认为是交入银行的献款，是没有利息的，并已实际使用。因此，时评中说我校献款“没有及时上缴，而用自己的名义存入银行。”的说法，就容易使人发生误会了。
