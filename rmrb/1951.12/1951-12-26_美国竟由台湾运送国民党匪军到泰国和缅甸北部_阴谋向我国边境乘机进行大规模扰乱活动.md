Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: U.S. imperialism is continuing to transport Kuomintang bandit troops from Taiwan to Thailand and northern Myanmar, plotting to take the opportunity to carry out large-scale disturbances on our border. To arrange troop transport matters, on November 13th, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Thailand, Kerr, flew to Taiwan to hold a meeting with the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Taiwan, Chase, and several representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Ministry of National Defense. According to a special report in the Bangkok Xing Siam Daily on November 13th, "Kerr's visit to Taiwan is related to the situation of Li Mi's troops on the border of Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Yunnan." It also said, "Li Mi's troops are urgently awaiting reinforcements."

Not long before this, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins suddenly flew to Bangkok on October 21st to meet with Kerr, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Thailand, and also visited Luang Phibunsongkhram and Thai military authorities. On October 26th, Collins hurriedly flew to Taiwan again. According to a United Press International report from Taipei on the same day, U.S. officials in Taiwan had "studied the military and diplomatic issues of Taiwan in detail" with Collins. A few days later, Chiang Kai-shek's acting representative in Thailand, Sun Biqi, and Consul General in Bangkok, Sun Bingqian, flew to Taiwan on the same plane. This series of activities shows that a new conspiracy is brewing between the Thai reactionary authorities and the Taiwan bandit gang under the auspices of the United States.

It is reported that in the meeting held in Taipei on November 13th by Chase and Kerr, with the participation of representatives from Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense, they discussed how to implement Collins' instructions to Chase at the end of October. These instructions required them to discuss in detail the issue of assembling Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in the northern regions of Thailand and Myanmar.

At the meeting, Chase explained that because the Myanmar government had once expressed concern about the gathering of Kuomintang remnant bandits in northern Myanmar territory, the work of reinforcing the bandit troops had to be suspended for a while. However, now that the Myanmar government and Myanmar public opinion have reduced their attention to this issue, Washington believes that the established plan to transfer bandit troops to the region must be completed in the near future.

It is reported that the meeting decided that the method of transporting troops in the future will still be the responsibility of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which will first transport the bandit troops from Taiwan to Bangkok, and then from Bangkok and Chiang Mai to their garrisons. According to Collins' instructions, the work of transporting Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Taiwan to Thailand is the responsibility of Chase, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Taiwan, while the transit and stationing of troops after they arrive in Thailand is the responsibility of Kerr, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Thailand. It is expected that the work of transporting the first batch of 70,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops will be completed by the end of 1951.

The collusion between the Thai reactionary government and the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique is a well-known fact. The Bangkok Chung Yuan Evening News acknowledged that Kerr's visit to Taiwan this time will enable "Thailand and Taiwan to obtain closer cooperation in times of emergency." The newspaper also admitted that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops currently entrenched in the border areas of Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam are receiving "assistance" from various parties. Recently, the Luang Phibunsongkhram government's decision to build a strategic highway in northern Thailand is also part of this conspiracy. On November 28th, the Bangkok Quan Min Bao reported that the U.S. aid technical team stationed in Thailand recently surveyed the strategic highway from Lampang to Chiang Rai, and the Thai authorities have included the construction cost of the line in next year's budget. The Chung Yuan Daily also reported on November 30th that the Thai government has decided to allocate 10 million baht for the construction of the strategic highway in Chiang Rai Province. Chiang Rai is in the northernmost part of Thailand, adjacent to the Myanmar border and our Yunnan, and is an important base for U.S. imperialism to supply Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops through Thailand. There are roads there leading to Kengtung in Myanmar, which is now occupied by Li Mi's remnant bandits.

    美国竟由台湾运送国民党匪军到泰国和缅甸北部
    阴谋向我国边境乘机进行大规模扰乱活动
     【新华社二十五日讯】美帝国主义正在继续将国民党匪军由台湾运到泰国和缅甸北部，阴谋向我国边境乘机进行大规模的扰乱活动。为布置运兵事宜，十一月十三日美驻泰军事顾问团团长柯尔飞赴台湾，和美驻台军事顾问团团长蔡斯及蒋匪国防部代表多人举行会议。据曼谷星暹日报十一月十三日特讯说：“柯尔此次访台，系与在泰、缅、越、滇边界之李弥部情况有关。”又说：“李弥部现正急待增援”。
    在这以前不久，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯在十月二十一日突然飞到曼谷，和美驻泰军事顾问团团长柯尔会谈，并曾访问銮披汶和泰国军事当局。十月二十六日柯林斯又匆匆飞到台湾，据当日合众社台北消息，驻台美国官员曾和柯林斯“详细研究台湾的军事和外交问题”。不几天，蒋匪驻泰代办孙匪碧奇和驻曼谷总领事孙匪秉乾，又同机飞赴台湾。这一连串活动表明，在美国主持下，一个新的阴谋正在泰国反动当局和台湾匪帮之间酝酿中。
    据悉，十一月十三日有蒋匪国防部代表参加的蔡斯和柯尔在台北所召开的会议中，曾讨论了如何执行柯林斯十月底给蔡斯的指示，这个指示是要他们详细讨论在泰、缅两国北部地区集结蒋匪部队的问题。
    会中蔡斯说明：由于缅甸政府对国民党残匪集结在缅甸国土北部曾一度表示不安，增援匪军的工作不得不一度停顿。但现在缅甸政府和缅甸社会舆论，已减少对这一问题的注意，华盛顿方面认为，必须在最近期间内完成向该地区调运匪军的既定计划。
    据悉，会议决定今后运兵的办法，仍由美国第七舰队负责，先由台湾将匪军运到曼谷，然后再经由曼谷和清迈开赴驻地。根据柯林斯的指示，蒋匪军队由台运泰的工作由美驻台军事顾问团团长蔡斯负责，而到达泰国后的军队过境和军队驻扎问题，就由美驻泰军事顾问团团长柯尔负责。预计运输第一批蒋匪军七万人的工作，将在一九五一年年底结束。
    泰国反动政府和美蒋勾结，已是尽人皆知的事实。曼谷中原晚报承认：此次柯尔访台将使“泰国与台湾在时局紧急时，获得更密切之配合”。该报并承认：现盘据在泰、缅、越边境地带的蒋匪军受到各方的“资助”。最近銮披汶政府又决定修筑泰国北部战略公路，也正是这种阴谋计划的一部分。十一月二十八日曼谷全民报消息说：驻泰国的美援技术团最近调查了喃邦至清莱的战略公路，泰当局已将该线修筑费列入明年预算中。中原报十一月三十日也报道：泰政府已决定拨出一千万铢作为建筑清莱府战略公路的费用。清莱在泰国最北部，邻近缅甸国境和我国云南，为美帝国主义通过泰国接济蒋匪军的重要基地，那里有公路通向缅甸境内现为李弥残匪盘据的景栋。
