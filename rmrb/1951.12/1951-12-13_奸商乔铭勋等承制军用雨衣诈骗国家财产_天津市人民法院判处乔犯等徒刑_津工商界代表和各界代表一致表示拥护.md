Qiao Mingxun, Director of the Tianjin Rubber Industry Trade Association and Deputy Manager of the privately-owned Zhengzhong Rubber Factory, and Li Bingjia, Deputy Manager of the privately-owned Dongchang Rubber Factory, defrauded the state of eighty billion yuan by fraudulent means in undertaking the production of military raincoats. After the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court opened a court session on December 11 and announced the verdict, sentencing the defendant Qiao Mingxun to three years in prison and the defendant Li Bingjia to one year in prison according to law.

The criminal facts of Qiao and Li are as follows: Last winter, Qiao Mingxun, in his capacity as a member of the Tianjin Rubber Industry Trade Association and a representative of the contractor, signed a contract with the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region to manufacture military raincoats. The certifier was the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government. The raw materials for the raincoats (cloth, rubber, gasoline) were all supplied by the military, and all payments were made in advance. In addition to guaranteeing that the quality of the goods met the specifications and delivering them on time, the contractors did not bear any operational risks. At the time of signing the contract, both parties agreed and clearly stipulated in the contract that the profit margin was 5%. However, Qiao committed fraud by raising the cost of the raincoats by fraudulent means. Before signing the contract, Qiao did not solicit the opinions of his peers, but privately colluded with Li Bingjia, the deputy manager of the privately-owned Dongchang Rubber Factory, to conspire to deceive the government and raised the cost of the raincoats (including the cloth, rubber, gasoline supplied by the military, all factory expenses, and profits) from over 114,000 yuan per piece to 141,000 yuan. The biggest fraud was that Qiao deliberately falsely reported the amount of gasoline used for rubberizing the cloth, and defrauded a large amount of gasoline. There are two methods for rubberizing raincoats: manual scraping and three-roll calendaring. The former consumes more gasoline (a reasonable amount is three and a half gallons per piece of cloth), while the latter consumes very little (one gallon per piece of cloth). Qiao and Li concealed the number of rubber factories in Tianjin that had three-roll calendaring equipment at the ordering meeting, and took advantage of the weakness of some cadres in state organs to set the gasoline consumption standard using the manual scraping method, in order to reap huge profits. In fact, 91.66% of all products were manufactured using the three-roll calendaring method. According to the contract, 4.5 gallons of gasoline (later changed to 4.3 gallons) were used for each piece of cloth, Qiao and Li raised the price by 3.3 to 3.5 gallons per piece of cloth. In addition, Qiao also raised dyeing fees, sewing fees, business expenses, and other various material costs. For example, the original contract stipulated that the dyeing fee for each piece of cloth was 45,000 yuan, but the actual cost was only 32,500 yuan. During the production process, Qiao also cut corners, using inferior cloth to steal and replace the Wufu cloth and Shuanglong cloth supplied by the military, resulting in poor quality raincoats, with defective products accounting for more than one-third of the total.

Qiao and Li also violated the contract by repeatedly failing to deliver the goods on time, delaying military needs. According to the contract, the goods were to be delivered in four installments, but nothing was delivered after the first deadline; after the second deadline, only a small portion of the first installment was delivered, and only one-third of the second installment. The main reason for the delay in delivery was that Qiao had deposited the payment in the bank to earn interest for himself. After the contract was signed, Qiao received 7,897,700,000 yuan in auxiliary material fees for raincoats from the ordering party, the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, and deposited it in the bank to earn interest for himself. He also colluded with individual manufacturers and squeezed out other manufacturers, resulting in delays and hindering production. Due to the fraudulent behavior of Qiao and Li, according to the contract price and reasonable cost, and calculated based on the original material prices, the state's tangible losses amounted to approximately 80 billion yuan. If the intangible losses such as a large number of defective products, delayed delivery, which affected the supply of military needs, and serious waste in production are included, the state's losses would be even greater.

After the contractors started work, problems such as excessive gasoline consumption and high cost estimates were gradually exposed. When the ordering party ordered the contractors to report the actual amount of gasoline required, Qiao and Li even instigated the factories to over-report the amount of consumption, continuing to deceive the government. Later, when the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government sent personnel to investigate the actual amount of oil consumption, Qiao and Li secretly convened a meeting and issued a unified cost sheet in order to deal with the investigation, and fabricated dialogues in advance in order to achieve the purpose of defrauding illegal profits. Based on the reports from the public and the above-mentioned situation, the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate, with the assistance of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, conducted an in-depth investigation, confirmed the criminal facts of Qiao and Li, and filed a lawsuit with the Tianjin Municipal People's Court on April 16 this year. The Tianjin Municipal People's Court then arrested Qiao and Li.

The Tianjin Municipal People's Court opened a court session on December 11 and announced the verdict, sentencing the defendant Qiao Mingxun to three years in prison and the defendant Li Bingjia to one year in prison. According to the judgment, the part of the cost book in the raincoat manufacturing contract signed by Qiao, representing the Tianjin Rubber Industry Trade Association member manufacturers, with the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, where the gasoline was calculated at a higher rate, was abandoned. The amount of gasoline used for calendaring was calculated at 1.5 gallons, and the amount of gasoline overspent should be recovered and turned over to the state treasury. The gasoline used for scraping will be leniently exempted from recovery. Qiao, representing the member manufacturers of the Tianjin Rubber Industry Trade Association, should fulfill the contractual obligations for delayed delivery, including the penalties for late delivery.

More than 300 people, including representatives of the Tianjin business community and representatives of various agencies and organizations, attended the sentencing hearing. Everyone unanimously expressed their support for the judgment of the Municipal People's Court. Wang Guangying, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "The Municipal People's Court's legal sanctions against Qiao Mingxun and others for raising costs to seek exorbitant profits, damaging state property, and affecting the supply of military needs is completely correct. I represent the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce in expressing my full support." Liu Yuming, Director of the Tianjin Educational Supplies Business Trade Association, said: "In the national patriotic movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, Qiao Mingxun, as the Director of the Rubber Industry Trade Association, actually took advantage of the urgent need for raincoats for military needs to deceive the government. This is a violation of the interests of our people. Our industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin must take the Qiao Mingxun incident as a good lesson in the future."

Qiao Mingxun and Li Bingjia fully admitted their criminal facts and expressed their obedience to the judgment of the Municipal People's Court. (Xinhua News Agency)

    奸商乔铭勋等承制军用雨衣诈骗国家财产
    天津市人民法院判处乔犯等徒刑
    津工商界代表和各界代表一致表示拥护
    天津市橡胶工业同业公会主任委员、私营震中橡胶厂副经理乔铭勋和私营东昌橡胶厂副经理李炳甲，在承制军用雨衣中以欺骗手段牟取暴利，使国家财产损失八十亿元案，经天津市人民检察署提起公诉后，已在十二月十一日由天津市人民法院开庭宣判，依法判处乔犯铭勋有期徒刑三年，李犯炳甲有期徒刑一年。
    乔、李两犯的犯罪事实如下：去年冬天乔铭勋以天津市橡胶工业同业公会会员、承制商代表人身份，与华北军区后勤部军需部订立承做军用雨衣合同。鉴证人是中央人民政府轻工业部。雨衣原料（布匹、橡胶、汽油）都由军方供给，各项价款也都先期拨付。各承制厂商除保证货品的质量合于规格并按时交货外，不担负任何经营上的风险。在签订合同时，双方商妥并在合同中明文规定利润为百分之五。但乔犯却用欺诈手段抬高雨衣成本。在订立合同前，乔犯不征求同业意见，私自拉拢私营东昌橡胶厂副经理李炳甲，合谋欺骗，把雨衣成本（包括军方供给的布、胶、汽油、厂方一切费用和利润）由每件十一万四千余元提高到十四万一千元。其中，欺诈最大的是乔犯蓄意谎报胶布上胶的汽油用量，骗取了大量汽油。雨衣上胶分手工刮胶和三联滚贴胶两种方法。前者费汽油较多（合理用量是每匹布用油三加仑半）后者费油极少（每匹布用一加仑）。乔、李两犯在定货会议上隐瞒天津有三联滚设备的橡胶厂的家数，利用国家机关某些干部工作上的弱点，以手工刮胶方法订定用油标准，从中牟取暴利。实际上全部制品的百分之九十一点六六都是用三联滚贴胶方法制造的。按合同规定每匹布上胶用汽油四点五加仑（后改为四点三加仑）计算，乔、李两犯每匹布即抬高了三点三到三点五加仑。此外，乔犯并把染费、缝纫费、业务费和其他各种材料费用抬高。如原合同中规定每匹布染费为四万五千元，但是实际只需三万二千五百元。在制作过程中，乔犯又偷工减料，用粗劣布匹盗换军方所供给的五福布和双龙布，以致制出雨衣质量低劣，次品占总数量三分之一以上。
    乔、李两犯又违犯合同规定，一再不按期交货，贻误军需。根据合同规定共分四期交货，但第一次到期后一件未交；第二次到期后，除补交第一期应交数外，只交了第二期应交数的三分之一弱。延误交货的主要原因是乔犯曾把货款存入银行生息肥己。在合同订立后，乔犯即向定货人——华北军区后勤部军需部领得雨衣副料费七十八亿九千七百万元，私自存入银行生息，并拉拢个别厂家，排挤其他厂家，致延误时日，妨碍了生产。由于乔、李两犯的欺诈行为，根据合同价格和合理成本并按原物料价格计算，国家有形损失约达八十亿元。如将大量次品、交货误期以致影响军需供应和生产中严重浪费等无形损失计入，那么国家的损失更为巨大。
    各承制厂商开工以后，陆续暴露了汽油用量过多、成本价格估计过高等问题。当定货人令各承制厂商实报所需汽油用量时，乔、李两犯竟仍唆使各厂多报用量，继续欺骗政府。其后，中央人民政府轻工业部派员调查实际用油量时，乔、李两犯为了对付调查，竟秘密集会，印发统一成本表，事先编造对话，以图达到诈取非法暴利的目的。天津市人民检察署根据市民群众反映和上述情况，在最高人民检察署协助下，深入调查，证实乔、李两犯的犯罪事实，在今年四月十六日向天津市人民法院起诉。天津市人民法院即将乔、李两犯先后逮捕。
    天津市人民法院在十二月十一日开庭宣判，判处乔犯铭勋有期徒刑三年，李犯炳甲有期徒刑一年。依照判决，乔犯代表天津市橡胶工业同业公会会员承制厂与华北军区后勤部军需部订立的承制雨衣合同中成本书内汽油抬高计算部分废弃，贴胶汽油用量，按一加仑半计算，超支汽油用量，应追回交入国库。刮胶所用汽油，从宽免予追交。乔犯代表天津市橡胶工业同业公会会员各承制厂交货误期，应按合同所订分期交货及误期罚款办法履行。
    到庭旁听宣判的有：天津市工商界代表和各机关、团体代表等三百多人。大家对市人民法院的判决一致表示拥护。天津市工商业联合会秘书长王光英说：市人民法院对乔铭勋等抬高成本牟取暴利，损害国家财产，影响军需供应的罪行，给予法律上的制裁，是完全正确的。我代表天津市工商业联合会表示完全拥护。天津市教育用品商业同业公会主任委员刘玉铭说：在全国人民热烈开展抗美援朝的爱国运动中，乔铭勋身为橡胶工业同业公会主任委员，竟利用军需上对雨衣迫切需要的机会，欺骗政府，这是违反了我们全国人民利益的行为。我们天津市工商业者今后一定要把乔铭勋的事件作为很好的教训。
    乔铭勋、李炳甲对他们的犯罪事实表示全部承认，并表示服从市人民法院的判决。　（新华社）
