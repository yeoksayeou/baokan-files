Due to the fact that the national wage system has not yet been fully adjusted and unified, and many public and private enterprises in various regions have not yet established reasonable wage and bonus systems; and the workers actually calculate the year-end double pay or year-end bonus as part of their wages. Therefore, in public and private enterprises with the original year-end double pay or year-end bonus system, it is difficult and unreasonable to abolish the old year-end double pay or year-end bonus before a new and reasonable wage system and bonus system are established. For this reason, the Committee hereby gives the following instructions on the handling of the issue of old year-end double pay or year-end bonuses for public and private enterprises in 1951.

1.  All state-owned enterprises shall be handled in accordance with the "Measures for Handling the Issue of Original Year-End Double Pay or Bonuses for Certain State-Owned Enterprises" issued by this Committee on December 11, 1949. Those who made reasonable adjustments last year may still be handled according to last year's methods.

    The measures announced by the Committee in 1949 are as follows:

    (1) All state-owned enterprises that originally did not issue year-end double pay or bonuses shall continue not to issue them.

    (2) All state-owned enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses not exceeding half a month's wages shall be issued according to the original amount.

    (3) All state-owned enterprises that originally issued year-end double pay or bonuses exceeding half a month's wages shall, in addition to issuing half a month's wages as double pay or bonuses, issue half of the excess, but the maximum shall not exceed two months' wages (including the aforementioned half month's wages), and may be issued in installments.

2.  All ministries, administrations, and banks directly under the Central People's Government shall not issue year-end double pay from this year onwards, regardless of whether there were old practices of year-end double pay or similar year-end double pay in the past.

3.  Private enterprises shall issue year-end double pay in accordance with the standards of their respective enterprises last year. If this year's profits are particularly high, in addition to issuing double pay to workers and staff in accordance with last year's standards, the labor union and the employer may negotiate and handle the matter in accordance with the provisions of "Article 25 of the Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises." If the business situation is not good and there is no ability to issue double pay, labor and management may negotiate to reduce or not issue it. If no year-end double pay or bonus was issued last year due to business losses, but this year's business does have profits, and there is an old practice of issuing year-end double pay, the labor union and the employer may negotiate and decide whether or not to issue it or how much to issue based on the actual situation. If the collective contract or agreement originally signed by labor and management already has provisions, it shall be issued in accordance with the provisions.

4.  The method of issuing year-end double pay or similar year-end double pay is an imperfect and unreasonable subsidy system from the principle of wage system or bonus system. With the continued recovery and development of production, the shortcomings of this system will become more apparent. Therefore, this Committee plans to require public and private enterprises across the country to take active steps from 1952 onwards to combine the reform of the wage system and the implementation of a reasonable bonus system to replace the old system of year-end double pay or bonuses.

    中央人民政府政务院财经委员会
    关于一九五一年度公私企业旧有的年终
    双薪或年终奖金问题的处理办法的指示
    由于全国工资制度尚未完全调整和统一，很多地区的公私企业尚未建立起合理的工资制度和奖励制度；而工人实际上又是把年终双薪或年终奖金计算在工资内的。因而在原有年终双薪或年终奖金制度的公私企业中在新的合理的工资制度和奖励制度未确立以前，取消旧有的年终双薪或年终奖金是困难的，也是不合理的。为此，本委对一九五一年度公私企业旧有的年终双薪或年终奖金问题的处理办法，特作如下指示。一、所有公营企业单位，一律照本委一九四九年十二月十一日“关于某些公营企业原有年终双薪或奖金问题的处理办法”处理，去年曾作合理调整者，可仍按去年办法处理。
    一九四九年本委公布的办法如下：
    （1）所有公营企业单位，原来不发年终双薪或奖金者，一律照旧不发。
    （2）所有公营企业单位，原来发年终双薪或奖金不超过半个月工资者，按原规定数目发给。
    （3）所有公营企业单位，原来发年终双薪或奖金超过半个月工资者，除发给半个月工资的双薪或奖金外，其超过部分折半发给，但最高不得超过两个月的工资（包括上述半个月工资在内），并可分期发给。
    二、中央人民政府所属各部、署、行，不问过去有无年终双薪或类似年终双薪的旧例，今年起一律不发年终双薪。
    三、私营企业一律按照各该企业去年标准发给年终双薪，如今年盈余特多者，除按去年标准发给工人职员双薪外，还可由工会和资方经过协商，按照“私营企业暂行条例第二十五条”的规定办理。如营业情况不好，无力发给双薪者，可由劳资双方协商，酌量减低或不发。如去年因营业亏本未发年终双薪或奖金，但今年营业确有盈余，而又有发给年终双薪旧例者，可由工会和资方经过协商，根据实际情况决定发给与否或发多少。如劳资双方原来订立的集体合同或契约中已有规定者，按规定发给。
    四、发给年终双薪或类似年终双薪的办法，从工资制度或奖励制度的原则上讲是一种不完全合理的津贴制度，随着生产的继续恢复和发展，此种制度的缺点亦将更加暴露出来，因此，本委拟议从一九五二年起，要求全国公私企业采取积极步骤结合改革工资制度和推行合理的奖励制度，以代替年终双薪或奖金的旧制度。主任    陈    云一九五一年十二月八日
