    China Department Store Northeast Company
    Inspects Serious Obstruction Phenomena in Commodity Circulation
    The company is adjusting its organization, inventorying stock, and improving commodity supply work.
    The Northeast District Company of China Department Store has recently inspected the serious obstruction phenomena in the commodity circulation process. The company has taken some measures to address this situation and is working to completely change it.
    From the third quarter of this year, the Northeast District Department Store has successively purchased a large number of commodities. However, according to statistics at the end of October, 58% of the commodities controlled by the Northeast District Department Store system were in the warehouses of the Northeast District Department Store and various wholesale stations (including industrial production raw materials), while the city and county companies engaged in sales and promotion only controlled a little less than 42%; forming an unreasonable phenomenon of commodity backlog on one hand and incomplete commodity supply on the other.
    The basic reason for the obstruction of commodity circulation is that the Northeast District Department Store only focused on organizing sources of materials and relaxed the work of commodity distribution and sales. Some people believe that "the completion of the procurement task means the completion of the entire task." Therefore, when factories and mines notified them to pick up goods, they immediately bought them, but did not consider how to distribute them to various wholesale stations and how to organize city and county department stores to promote sales. In July, the Northeast District Department Store purchased more than 2 billion yuan worth of saccharin. Some business personnel, fearing that it would affect the sales of granulated sugar, kept the batch of saccharin in backlog for two months. However, a certain department requested to purchase saccharin from the Shenyang Department Store several times but failed to buy it. For example, the Northeast District Department Store allocated a batch of watches to the Shenyang Department Store, but there was no incoming price. The cadres in charge of commodities did not promptly find a way to resolve the pricing issue, so they could not sell them. In addition, when distributing commodities, they did not understand the inventory and sales situation of the grassroots companies, but only distributed them according to "contracts." Therefore, commodities purchased by the district company according to market development needs outside the supply contract cannot be quickly distributed. At the same time, the general grassroots companies do not have a sufficient understanding of the overall supply and sales situation, and only see the shortage of industrial products (because the goods cannot reach them), resulting in conservative thinking. In October, inventory commodities in the district company and wholesale stations accounted for 58%; forming a situation of "more at the top and less at the bottom," which affected the completion of the sales plan. In October, the sales volume of Northeast District department store commodities only completed 19.30% of the quarterly plan.
    Some comrades in the wholesale stations also lack the idea of accelerating commodity circulation. For example, after the Harbin area wholesale station signed a contract with the city and county companies, they did not seriously and conscientiously urge the city and county companies to implement it. They adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the ideological bias of some grassroots companies that one-sidedly emphasized famous brands and did not promote non-famous brands and unpopular, backlogged, and defective goods in many ways. For example, the department stores in Acheng, Bin County, and Bayan in Songjiang Province adopted the "zero-take, zero-sell" method, only selecting good-selling commodities, so that they only picked up goods eight times a month, and the total value of each pickup was sometimes only 2 million yuan.
    Secondly, the business departments of the department store system lack strict planning and organization. For example, the paper sent by the Northeast District Department Store to Guan Nei was sometimes "there are cars but no goods," and sometimes "there are goods but no cars," so the plan could not be completed. The business department signed a regular repayment contract with the provincial and municipal companies, but the finance department could not recover the arrears on time, resulting in large outstanding debts and a shortage of funds for procurement. The chaotic procedures in transportation and allocation also seriously affected commodity circulation. Materials sent from Guan Nei to Dalian were mixed with goods from different units, and the cargo bills and tax bills were not sent along with the goods. It took nearly a month to sort them out before they were sent to Shenyang and other parts of Northeast China. However, when this batch of materials was sent from Dalian to Shenyang again, there was a phenomenon of "cargo bills and tax bills not following the goods" and confusion in receiving goods. A large number of commodities needed to be re-sorted. Among them, the woolen cloth that was suitable for the season alone took half a month to sort out in Shenyang and could not be distributed in time.
    In addition, due to incomplete allocation procedures and the irresponsibility of some staff members, many unnecessary backlogs have also been created.
    The above problems have attracted the attention of the leading cadres of the Northeast District Department Store. At present, they are organizing personnel to carry out inventory sorting and distribution work, and are urging various regional wholesale stations to improve the commodity supply work to city and county grassroots companies. The inventory of the Shenyang wholesale station has been cleared out, and on-site distribution is being carried out. The Northeast District Department Store is also adjusting its organizational structure, clarifying the division of labor and connections between various business departments, and thoroughly reforming certain systems and allocation procedures to improve the commodity distribution and supply work of the department store system.

### 中国百货公司东北区公司  检查商品流转过程中的严重阻滞现象  该公司正调整组织、清点库存、改进商品供应工作

    中国百货公司东北区公司
    检查商品流转过程中的严重阻滞现象
    该公司正调整组织、清点库存、改进商品供应工作
    中国百货公司东北区公司，最近检查了商品流转过程中的严重阻滞现象。该公司已针对这种情况作了一些措施，着手彻底改变这一情况。
    从今年第三季度起，东北区百货公司曾陆续采购了大量商品。但是根据十月末的统计，东北区百货系统所掌握的商品，有百分之五十八存在东北区百货公司和各批发站的仓库里（包括工业生产原料），而经营推销业务的各市、县公司却仅仅掌握着百分之四十二弱；形成了一方面商品积压、一方面商品不全的不合理现象。
    产生商品流转阻滞的基本原因，首先是东北区百货公司只重视了组织物资来源，放松了商品分拨和推销的工作。有人认为：“采购任务完成了，就算完成了全部任务。”所以，厂矿一通知提货，立即买入，但并不考虑如何分拨给各批发站和如何组织市、县百货公司推销。东北区百货公司七月中购进了价值二十多亿元的糖精，某些业务人员怕影响砂糖销路，竟把这批糖精积压两月之久。但某部却几次向沈阳市百货公司求购糖精而未买到。再如：东北区百货公司拨给沈阳市百货商店一批手表，没有来货价格，主管商品的干部也不及时设法解决作价问题，没法销售。另外，分配商品时不了解基层公司的库存和销售情况，只根据“合同”分拨。因此，在供应合同之外，区公司根据市场发展需要而采购进来的商品，就不能迅速分拨下去。同时一般基层公司对整个供销情况了解不足，只看到工业品不足（因货到不了手），产生了保守思想。十月份库存商品在区公司、批发站的占百分之五十八；形成“上多下少”，影响销售计划的完成。十月份东北区百货商品的卖钱额仅完成全季度计划的百分之十九点三零。
    某些批发站的同志，同样缺乏加速商品流转思想。如哈尔滨地区批发站与市县公司签订合同后，不严肃认真地督促市县公司执行，对某些基层公司片面强调名牌货，不从多方面推销非名牌货和冷货、背货、残货的思想偏向，采取放任态度。如松江省阿城、宾县、巴彦等百货公司采取“零取零卖”办法，只选好销的商品，以致一个月仅取货八次，每次取货总值有时才二百万元。
    其次，百货公司系统的业务部门，缺乏严密的计划性与组织性。如东北区百货公司发往关内的纸张，一时是“有车没货”，一时又“有货没车”，因而不能完成计划。业务部门与各省市公司签订定期偿付合同，但财务部门不能按期收回欠款，使往来欠款很大，采购用款呈现支绌现象。在运输、调拨方面的手续混乱，也严重地影响了商品流转。自关内发到大连的物资，由于不同单位的商品混在一起，以及货票和税票未跟随货物一块发到，清点了近一个月，才发往沈阳及东北各地。但这批物资从大连再发到沈阳时，又出现了“货票、税票不随货走”以及收货上的混乱现象，大批商品又需要重新清点一番。其中正适合季节需要的呢子，仅在沈阳就清点了半个月不能及时分拨出去。
    此外，由于调拨手续不周密，以及某些工作人员不负责任，也造成很多不应有的积压现象。
    以上问题，已引起东北区百货公司领导干部的重视。目前，他们正组织人员进行库存的清点分拨工作，并督促各地区批发站改善对市县基层公司的商品供应工作。沈阳批发站的库存已经清出一部，执行现场分拨。东北区百货公司也正调整组织机构，划清各业务部门的分工联系，彻底改革某些制度和调拨手续，以改进百货系统商品分配供应工作。
