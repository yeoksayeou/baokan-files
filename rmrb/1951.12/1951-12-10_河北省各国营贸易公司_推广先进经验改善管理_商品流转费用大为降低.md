Hebei Province State-Owned Trading Companies
Promote Advanced Experiences and Improve Management
Commodity Circulation Costs Greatly Reduced

Hebei Province's state-owned trading companies have made considerable achievements in increasing production and practicing economy. Since the beginning of this year, state-owned grain, general merchandise, cotton yarn, oil, and salt companies in Hebei Province have improved their management, greatly reducing commodity circulation costs. According to statistics from the first half of this year alone, savings exceeded the standards set by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government by more than 65 billion yuan.

Strengthening planning and harnessing the patriotic enthusiasm of workers are the main experiences of state-owned trading companies in Hebei Province in vigorously practicing economy and reducing commodity circulation costs. Workers at the Hebei Province State-Owned Grain Company created circular, ventilated grain stacks for storing grain, which allows grain with a moisture content of 17 percent to be stored without turning or becoming moldy. The company's workers also converted grain stacks with a capacity of 60,000 catties in the past into large stacks with a capacity of 120,000 catties. According to statistics from the 1,800 large stacks that had been converted by the end of May, the materials saved, such as sleepers and mats, were worth more than 6.2 billion yuan. In the past, the Hebei Province General Merchandise Company mechanically allocated goods according to the administrative system, wasting a lot of freight costs. After repeated research by the workers, direct transportation was implemented, which accelerated the speed of goods transfer and reduced loading, unloading, and handling costs.

Hebei Province's state-owned trading companies have paid attention to promoting advanced experiences in vigorously practicing economy, which has achieved remarkable results. For example, the Hebei Province Grain Company and its branch company warehouse managers have organized inspection teams to visit each branch company in turn to exchange experiences in grain storage management. The Hebei Province General Merchandise Company organized staff from its affiliated branches to learn methods of processing local sugar and granulated sugar, and converted a large amount of sugar, turning previously slow-selling sugar into fast-selling sugar. In addition, state-owned trading companies in Hebei Province also paid attention to the rational use of funds, and implemented a system of fixed cash inventory and fixed commodity inventory, thereby accelerating the turnover of funds. For example, in the first half of this year, the capital turnover rate of the Hebei Province Cotton Yarn Company accelerated by 63.64 percent compared to the second half of last year.

Currently, nine companies in Hebei Province, including state-owned grain, general merchandise, cotton yarn, and native products companies, have formulated a plan to save 50 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter. To ensure the completion of the plan, each company and its workers have formulated specific plans to vigorously practice economy and reduce commodity costs in the labor competition of increasing production and practicing economy.

    河北省各国营贸易公司
    推广先进经验改善管理
    商品流转费用大为降低
    河北省各国营贸易公司在增产节约方面已有相当成绩。今年以来，河北省国营粮食、百货、花纱布、油脂、盐业等公司改善了经营管理，使商品流转费用大为降低。仅据今年上半年的统计，就较中央人民政府贸易部规定标准节省了六百五十多亿元。
    加强计划性和发挥职工的爱国热情，是河北省各国营贸易公司在厉行节约、减低商品流转费用工作中的主要经验。河北省国营粮食公司的职工们创造了存粮用的圆形透风垛，能使含水份百分之十七的存粮不翻晒也不致霉烂。该公司职工又将过去容量六万斤的粮垛改制为容量十二万斤的大垛，仅据一月到五月底已改制好的一千八百个大垛统计，节省的枕木、席子等材料就值六十二亿多元。河北省百货公司过去机械地按行政系统调拨货物，浪费了很多运费；经过职工们多次研究后，实行了直线运输，因而加速了调货速度，减少了装卸、搬运等费用。
    河北省各国营贸易公司在厉行节约中，注意推广先进经验，已得到显著成效。如河北省粮食公司和分、支公司的管库人员，曾组织参观检查团轮流到各分、支公司交流粮食保管工作方面的经验。河北省百货公司组织所属分、支机构的工作人员学会土糖、砂糖加工方法，改制了大量食糖，使过去滞销的糖转为畅销。此外，河北省各国营贸易公司还注意合理地使用资金，并且实行了现金库存定额和商品库存定额的制度，因而加速了资金的周转。例如今年上半年河北省花纱布公司的资金周转率就比去年下半年加速了百分之六十三点六四。
    现在，河北省国营粮食、百货、花纱布、土产等九个公司，已订出了第四季度节省商品流转费用五百亿元的计划。为保证完成计划，各公司和职工在增产节约的劳动竞赛中，都订出了厉行节约、减低商品成本的具体计划。    （据新华社消息）
