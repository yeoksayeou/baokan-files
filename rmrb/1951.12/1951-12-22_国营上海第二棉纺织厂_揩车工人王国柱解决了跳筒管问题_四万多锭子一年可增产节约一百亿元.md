State-run Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill
Reeling Frame Operator Wang Guozhu Solves the Problem of Jumping Bobbins
Over 40,000 Spindles Can Increase Production and Save 10 Billion Yuan Per Year
Reeling frame operator Wang Guozhu of the state-run Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill came up with a solution to the problem of jumping bobbins. After implementing this method throughout the factory, it is estimated that 10 billion yuan can be increased in production and saved each year.

During the production surge last year, the output of the state-run No. 2 Cotton Mill increased, setting the highest spindle draft record in the country. However, after the spindles rotated faster, a serious phenomenon of jumping bobbins occurred, which not only hindered the continuous increase in output but also increased repair costs. The factory mentioned this problem at every production meeting.

Wang Guozhu is a reeling frame operator who started to be responsible for repairing bobbins during the major overhaul in June this year. At the mobilization meeting for the production surge, he, like other workers, pledged to improve production. In the workshop, he felt unspeakably sad when he saw bobbins filled with yarn jumping to the ground, making the snow-white cotton yarn dirty and messy. He took these jumped bobbins back to the workshop for testing, but could not find any problems with the bobbins themselves. "Where exactly is the problem?" "How can it be cured?" He repeatedly conducted experiments. At first, he tried to install a rubber band on the bobbin, but it didn't work much, and the bobbin still jumped out. Later, he used iron sheets to clamp the broken rubber band and install it on the lower part of the spindle. In this way, the bobbin did not jump, but it was inconvenient to remove the bobbin. Once, he saw a pair of broken sneakers at a secondhand stall, and when he touched them, the rubber on the sneakers was very soft. He thought: Soft rubber has great elasticity, maybe it will work. So he bought the broken sneakers, cut a piece, and installed it on the spindle for testing. As a result, the bobbin did not jump, and it was not difficult to remove the spindle either.

On November 25th, this method was tested throughout the factory. As a result, the spindles with rubber rings installed did not have a single bobbin jumping out, and only 69 ends were broken on a machine with 400 spindles. However, 79 bobbins jumped out and 95 ends were broken on the 260 spindles without rubber rings installed. If all of the factory's more than 40,000 spindles are equipped with rubber rings, the front roller can be accelerated by ten revolutions, and 2,400 more pieces of 20-count yarn can be produced each year, and the reduced waste cotton can spin 48 pieces of yarn. In addition, saving labor and electricity can increase production and save the country wealth worth 10 billion yuan per year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国营上海第二棉纺织厂
    揩车工人王国柱解决了跳筒管问题
    四万多锭子一年可增产节约一百亿元
    国营上海第二棉纺织厂揩车工人王国柱想出解决跳筒管问题的办法。全厂实行这个办法后，预计每年可增产节约一百亿元。
    在去年突击增产时，国营第二棉纺织厂产量提高，曾创全国锭扯最高纪录。但锭子转动加快后，发生了严重的跳筒管现象，不但妨碍产量继续提高，而且还增加了修理费用。厂里每次开生产会议，都提到这个问题。
    王国柱是揩车工人，在今年六月大检修时开始负责修筒管。在突击增产的动员大会上，他和其他工人一样曾提出保证把生产搞好。在车间里，他看到络满纱的筒管跳到地上，雪白的棉纱弄得又脏又乱，心里说不出的难过。他把这些跳下来的筒管拿回工作室试验，但又查不出筒管有什么毛病。“毛病究竟在那里呢？”“怎样把它治好呢？”他反复地进行试验。起先他在筒管上试装了一个橡皮圈，但作用不大，筒管还是要跳出来。后来他用铁片把破橡皮圈夹住装在锭子下半部。这样，筒管不跳了，但拔筒管又不便当。有一次他在旧货摊上看到一双破球鞋，过去一摸，球鞋上的橡皮很软，他想：软橡皮的弹力大，也许能行。于是他就把破球鞋买回来，剪了一块装在锭子上试验，结果筒管不跳了，拔锭子也不费力。
    十一月二十五日，这个办法在全厂试验。结果，装了橡皮圈套的锭子，一个筒管也没有跳出来，一台车四百个锭子只有六十九根断头。而没有装橡皮圈套的二百六十个锭子，就有七十九个筒管跳了出来，有九十五根断头。如果全厂四万多个锭子全部装上橡皮圈套，前罗拉可以加快十转，一年可以增产二十支纱二千四百多件，减少的回丝可纺四十八件纱，加上节省的人工和电力，一年可给国家增产节约价值一百亿元的财富。（新华社）
