To mobilize minority peoples to do a good job in regional autonomy and launch production campaigns:
Guangxi Holds First Conference of Cadres on Minority Work.
The Oroqen Banner People's Government Has Been Established in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
Guangxi Province held its first conference of cadres on minority work in late November. The conference determined that the central tasks of the province's minority work for the coming year are: to mobilize minority peoples to do a good job in regional autonomy work and to universally launch production campaigns.

Before the meeting, some cadres in the province did not sufficiently recognize the importance of implementing ethnic regional autonomy and developing production. A small number of Han cadres mistakenly believed that implementing ethnic regional autonomy was dispensable. Some cadres also believed that "production cannot be developed in minority areas without carrying out anti-landlord, rent reduction, and deposit refund or land reform work." The meeting examined and criticized these erroneous ideas, further improving the ideological understanding of the cadres attending the meeting.

Based on the regulations on political construction work in minority areas of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central South Military and Political Committee and the joint instructions of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangxi Provincial People's Government on political construction work in minority areas, the meeting discussed and determined that ethnic regional autonomy should be implemented in all townships, districts, and counties where minority peoples live in concentrated communities; ethnic democratic united governments should be established in all townships, districts, and counties where minority populations live in mixed communities; and that in townships, districts, and counties with smaller minority populations, appropriate representatives should be elected from the minority people to participate in the local people's representative conferences. The meeting decided to strive to establish the Dayao Mountain Yao Autonomous Region in the spring of next year; strive to establish ethnic democratic united governments in the mixed areas of Miao, Yao, Dong, and Zhuang peoples in counties such as Xilong, Xilin, and Sanjiang before the autumn harvest of next year; and strive to complete the political construction work in other districts and counties with partial minority populations in the winter of next year.

Regarding the development of production, the meeting decided: to vigorously publicize the people's government's production policies and mobilize minority peoples to actively engage in production. Governments at all levels and relevant departments should thoroughly understand the specific conditions of minority areas, combine the needs of the local masses with the needs of the country's long-term production and construction, and formulate specific production plans. At present, emphasis should be placed on restoring grain production, strengthening the export of local and specialty products, so that their local and specialty products can be quickly exchanged for daily necessities such as salt and cloth. In addition, appropriate places should be selected to restore or establish market fairs (a type of trading place), and state-owned trading organizations should be established with a focus, especially organizing more mobile purchasing and sales teams to conduct purchasing and sales work in minority areas.

The meeting believed that implementing ethnic regional autonomy and developing production are two complex and arduous tasks that must be carried out with leadership and planning; especially the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy, sufficient preparations must be made in advance, and minority peoples must be earnestly mobilized to consciously participate in this work, and work should begin quickly to cultivate a large number of minority cadres and do a good job in publicity.

The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region conscientiously implemented the policy towards minority nationalities, accepted the request of the Oroqen people's representative meeting in the area to establish the Oroqen Banner People's Government. After submitting the request to the State Council of the Central People's Government for approval, the Oroqen Banner People's Government was established on November 1st.

On November 1st, the banner held a grand celebration. More than 300 representatives were sent by the Oroqen people scattered in the Hulunbuir League to participate in the celebration. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, the People's Government of Heilongjiang Province, and the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also sent silk banners to express their congratulations. At the celebration meeting, the head of the banner, Baisgulang, called on the people of the Oroqen Banner to learn from the advanced experiences of all fraternal ethnic groups under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and Chairman Ulanhu of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and to strive to build a great motherland and develop the economy and culture of the Oroqen people. Representatives of the Oroqen people also unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China for their deep concern for minority nationalities in their speeches, and promised to fulfill the various calls of the Communist Party and the People's Government with practical actions in the future. In order to express their love and respect for Chairman Mao and Ulanhu, the representatives specially gave the self-made leather boots, leather gloves, leather backpacks embroidered with patterns, leather mats and other special products to the conference for forwarding to Chairman Mao and Ulanhu.

The Oroqen people are one of the minority nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, scattered along the Dobukuer River, Nomin River, Namen River, Kuile River, Gan River and other rivers in the eastern Hinggan Mountains within the Hulunbuir League of the region. The people of this ethnic group make a living by hunting. Before the Japanese surrender, the Oroqen people suffered greatly under the persecution of the Manchu rulers, warlords, and Japanese imperialism, and large numbers of people died from poverty and disease. The ethnic group originally had more than 4,000 people in Inner Mongolia, but by the time the Soviet Red Army liberated the Northeast, only more than 1,000 people remained. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Oroqen district and village people's governments and cooperatives were established in the areas where the Oroqen people lived in concentrated communities, and Oroqen primary schools were opened. Hulunbuir League Middle School also specially set up classes for the children of the Oroqen people. The People's Government also treated the people of this ethnic group for diseases such as smallpox and trained many junior health workers. In addition, the People's Government also organized them to hunt, protect forests, and prevent fires, so that the lives of the Oroqen people gradually improved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    发动少数民族人民做好区域自治工作和开展生产运动
    广西举行第一次少数民族工作干部会议
    内蒙古自治区已成立鄂伦春旗人民政府
    广西省在上月下旬举行了第一次少数民族工作干部会议。会议确定了广西省今后一年少数民族工作的中心任务是：发动少数民族人民做好民族区域自治工作和普遍开展生产运动。
    会前，该省有些干部对实行民族区域自治和发展生产这两项工作的重要性认识不足。有少数的汉族干部错误地认为实行民族区域自治是可有可无的事。也有少数干部认为“在少数民族地区不进行反恶霸、退租退押或土地改革等工作就不能发展生产”。会议针对这些错误思想进行了检查和批判，使到会干部的思想认识提高了一步。
    会议依据中南军政委员会第四次全体会议关于少数民族地区建政工作的规定和中共广西省委员会、广西省人民政府关于少数民族地区建政工作联合指示的精神，讨论并确定了凡是少数民族聚居地区的乡、区、县都应实行民族区域自治；凡少数民族人口杂居的乡、区、县都应成立民族民主联合政府；凡少数民族人口较少的乡、区、县，应由少数民族选出适当代表，参加当地的各界人民代表会议。会议决定：争取在明年春季成立大瑶山瑶族自治区；西隆、西林、三江等县苗族、瑶族、侗族、僮族杂居区争取在明年秋收前建立民族民主联合政府；其他区、县部分少数民族杂居区的建政工作，争取在明年冬季完成。
    关于发展生产，会议决定：要大力宣传人民政府的生产政策，发动少数民族人民积极生产。各级政府和有关部门应切实了解少数民族地区的具体条件，把当地群众的需要和国家长期生产建设的需要结合起来，制订具体的生产计划。目前应着重恢复粮食生产，并加强土产和特产的外销，使他们的土产特产能迅速地换到食盐和布匹等日用必需品。此外，应选择适当的地方恢复或建立墟场（一种交易场所），并有重点地设立国营贸易机构，特别是应多组织流动购销组，深入少数民族地区进行购销工作。
    会议认为：实行民族区域自治和发展生产是两件复杂而艰巨的工作，必须有领导、有计划地进行；特别是实行民族区域自治，事先必须充分准备，认真地发动少数民族人民自觉地参加这个工作，并应迅速着手大量培养少数民族干部，做好宣传工作。

    内蒙古自治区人民政府认真贯彻执行少数民族政策，接受该区鄂伦春族人民代表会议决议成立鄂伦春旗人民政府的请求，经呈请中央人民政府政务院批准后，已在十一月一日成立了鄂伦春旗人民政府。
    十一月一日，该旗举行了盛大的庆祝会。散居在呼纳盟境内的鄂伦春族人民，推派了三百多名代表参加庆祝，中央人民政府内务部，黑龙江省人民政府、内蒙古自治区人民政府等单位，也送了锦旗致贺。在庆祝大会上，该旗旗长白斯古郎号召全旗鄂伦春族人民在中央人民政府毛主席、内蒙古自治区人民政府主席乌兰夫的领导下，学习各兄弟民族的先进经验，为建设伟大的祖国，发展鄂伦春族人民的经济和文化而奋斗。鄂伦春族人民代表在讲话中也一致表示感谢中央人民政府和中国共产党对少数民族的深切关怀，并保证今后要以实际行动完成共产党和人民政府的各种号召。为了表示对毛主席和乌兰夫的敬爱，代表们特将自制的皮靴子、皮手套、绣有花纹的皮制背包、皮褥等特产，交大会转送毛主席和乌兰夫。
    鄂伦春族是内蒙古自治区内的少数民族之一，散居在该区呼纳盟境内东兴安岭一带的多布库尔河、诺敏河、纳门河、奎勒河、甘河等河流两岸。该族人民以狩猎为业。日本投降以前，鄂伦春族在满清统治者、军阀和日本帝国主义的迫害下，人民因贫病而大批死亡。该族在内蒙古境内原有四千多人，到苏联红军解放东北时，只剩下一千多人。内蒙古自治区人民政府成立后，在鄂伦春族人民聚居地区，都成立了鄂伦春族区、村人民政府、合作社，开办了鄂伦春族小学。呼纳盟中学还为鄂伦春族人民的子弟特设了班次。人民政府又为该族人民医治天花等疾病，培养了许多初级卫生人员。此外，人民政府还组织他们打猎、护林、防火等，使鄂伦春族人民的生活逐渐得到改善。（新华社）
