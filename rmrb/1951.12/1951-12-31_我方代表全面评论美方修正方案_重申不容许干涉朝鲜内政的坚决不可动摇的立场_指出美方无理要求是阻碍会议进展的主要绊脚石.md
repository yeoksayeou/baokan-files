Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th. At the subcommittee meeting on the third item of the agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 30th, our representative made a comprehensive comment on the proposal put forward by the other side on December 29th. Our representative pointed out: After the realization of the Korean armistice, it is our consistent position to promptly convene a higher-level political conference to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops and other related matters, so as to thoroughly and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The previous proposal of the other side had declared that the goal of convening a higher-level political conference would be included in the articles of the principle agreement; this time it was cancelled again, and our side cannot agree to it.

In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice, our side suggested that both sides should guarantee that no military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition enter from outside Korea, but the other side's proposal only suggested that no reinforcement military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition enter from outside Korea. The other side obviously intends to retain the right to supplement war equipment and weapons and ammunition during the armistice period, that is, to increase its military strength from outside Korea, and our side cannot agree to it. In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice and to dispel the other side's fear of the growth of our air force strength, our December 24th proposal has agreed to explicitly state in the fourth principle that both sides guarantee that no combat aircraft will enter from outside Korea during the armistice period, and on the issue of supervision, it is agreed that when one or both parties in the Military Armistice Commission proposed by the other side to the neutral nations supervisory body requests an investigation of violations of the agreement, the neutral nations supervisory body shall be responsible for conducting inspections. The other side should no longer insist on its unreasonable demands to restrict our airport equipment and interfere in our internal affairs under the pretext of preventing the increase of military strength. However, this time, the other party's proposal still retains this requirement that our side firmly opposes and absolutely cannot accept. Our side has explained countless times the firm and unshakable position of not allowing interference in internal affairs. Whether or not our side carries out the restoration and construction of certain equipment in Korea is entirely a matter of our internal affairs. The military armistice conference has no right to discuss our internal affairs, and our side will never allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs. Our representative pointed out that this unreasonable demand that interferes in our internal affairs is the main stumbling block currently hindering the progress of the meeting. This stumbling block was moved out by the other side, and whether the meeting makes progress and the speed of progress completely depends on whether the other side removes this stumbling block, and when it removes it. At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth item of the agenda, the other side once again requested our side to provide materials on all prisoners of war ever captured by our side. Our representative pointed out: Our side has made a full explanation of the difference between the prisoners of war ever captured by our side and the prisoners of war currently held by our side, but in order to resolve the fourth item of the agenda as soon as possible, our side is fully prepared to provide the materials requested by the other side as much as possible. However, the other side must provide the information about the whereabouts of more than 44,000 of our prisoners of war and other relevant information that our side has already requested. And the exchange of materials should never affect the discussion of the principle of the speedy release and repatriation of all prisoners of war by both sides. The other side can no longer use this as an excuse to continue to delay the confirmation of this principle.

    我方代表全面评论美方修正方案
    重申不容许干涉朝鲜内政的坚决不可动摇的立场
    指出美方无理要求是阻碍会议进展的主要绊脚石 【新华社开城三十日电】三十日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表对对方在十二月二十九日提出的方案进行了全面的评论。我方代表指出：朝鲜停战实现后，迅速召开高一级的政治会议，讨论撤退一切外国军队及其他有关事项，以彻底和平解决朝鲜问题，乃我方一贯的主张。前此对方方案已声明将召开高一级的政治会议的目标，列入原则协议的条文中；此次又将其取消，我方不能同意。
    为保证军事停战的稳定，我方建议双方应保证不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，但对方方案却只建议不从朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。对方显然意图保留在停战期间进行战争装备与武器弹药的补充之权，亦即从朝鲜境外增加其军事力量，我方不能同意。为保证军事停战的稳定，并解除对方对我方空军力量生长的畏惧，我方十二月二十四日方案已同意在第四项原则规定中明文列出，双方保证在停战期间，不从朝鲜境外进入任何作战飞机，并在监察问题上，同意对方所提出的军事停战委员会中的双方或一方向中立国监察机构提出调查违反协议事件的请求时，中立国监察机构，即应负责进行视察的规定。对方再不应藉口防止军事力量的增加，坚持其限制我方机场设备的干涉我方内政的无理要求。但此次对方方案却仍然保留着这一我方坚决反对，绝对不能接受的要求。我方已经无数次地说明了不容许干涉内政的，坚决的，不可动摇的立场。我方在朝鲜境内进行或者不进行某种设备的恢复与修建，完全是我方的内政问题。军事停战会议无权讨论我方内政问题，我方亦绝不容许任何人干涉我方内政。我方代表指出这个干涉我方内政的无理要求，是目前阻碍会议进展的主要绊脚石。这个绊脚石是对方搬出来的，会议有无进展及进展的快慢，完全要看对方是否搬开，以及何时搬开这个绊脚石而定。第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方再度要求我方提供我方所曾经俘获的全部战俘的材料。我方代表指出：对于我方所曾经俘获的及我方目前所收容的战俘间的差额问题，我方已作了充分的解释，但为尽快解决第四项议程，我方完全准备尽量提供对方所要求的材料。但对方必须提供我方所早已提出的关于四万四千余我方战俘下落及其他有关资料。而材料的交换，决不应该影响双方迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则的讨论。对方不能再以此为藉口，继续拖延这一原则的确定。
