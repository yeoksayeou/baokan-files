    Zhoukoudian Lime Factory, Under the Construction Engineering Department of the Central Railway Ministry, Ceases Quarrying Work
    Self-Criticism of the Construction Engineering Department of the Central Railway Ministry
    Last autumn, with the approval of the Fangshan County People's Government, our department opened a lime factory in Zhoukoudian for quarrying and lime production. On November 9th of this year, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government forwarded a letter from the General Office of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, pointing out that the quarrying and lime production activities of our lime factory in Zhoukoudian were damaging cultural relics. Our department considered the matter serious and immediately notified the Zhoukoudian Lime Factory to stop quarrying. At the same time, we sent personnel to contact the Chinese Academy of Sciences to explain the quarrying process and express our regret over the matter. The occurrence of this incident shows that we did not pay enough attention to this historically significant cultural site. During the quarrying, we did not consider whether it would damage cultural relics, and therefore did not conduct further investigation and research. Now, our lime factory has found a suitable new mining area and is in the process of relocating the factory.

    周口店石灰厂停止采石工作
    中央铁道部建筑工程处的检讨
    我处在去年秋季，经房山县人民政府批准，在周口店开设石灰厂，采石炼灰。今年十一月九日中央人民政府铁道部转来中央人民政府文化教育委员会办公厅来函，指出周口店我处石灰厂的采石炼灰行为损及文化遗迹。我处认为问题严重，就一面紧急通知周口店石灰厂立刻停止开采；一面派员和中国科学院联系，说明开采经过，对这件事表示遗憾。这一事件的发生，说明我们对这一有历史意义的文化遗迹是不够重视的，在开采时，没有考虑到是否有损文物古迹的问题，因而没有作进一步的调查研究。现在我处石灰厂已经觅妥新矿区，正在进行迁厂工作中。
