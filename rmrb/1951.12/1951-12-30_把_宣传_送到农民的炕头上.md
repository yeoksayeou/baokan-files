     Bringing "Propaganda" to the Farmers' Kang
     Sun Qizhi
    Miao Kunyuan, the women's committee member of the Zainan Village branch of the Communist Party of China in Suning County, Hebei Province, is a party propagandist and is 43 years old this year. She only attended half a year of primary school, and she knows that without hard work, she cannot be a good propagandist. She goes to the people's school every day, and she also takes one or two hours from work and production to read newspapers, propaganda manuals, and study cultural lessons, quickly disseminating what she learns to the masses. When the movement to popularize and deepen the Resistance Against America and Aid Korea was launched in the village, she and propagandists Wang Darui and Han Yulan discussed and mobilized seven female cadres and activists among the masses to form a propaganda team and go deep into the women's masses to carry out propaganda. In a day and a half, they held twenty-two small-scale discussion meetings, educating two hundred and seventeen households and two hundred and eighty-two women about Resistance Against America and Aid Korea. Twelve women had special reasons for not participating in the discussion meetings, so Miao Kunyuan went deep into each house for door-to-door visits, bringing "propaganda" to the farmers' kang. Even Zhang Pan, who had just given birth and could not go out, and the family of Lü Shouchun, who was suffering from a cold, heard her propaganda and understood the principles of Resistance Against America and Aid Korea. In this way, the vast majority of women in the village received two to five rounds of patriotic education on Resistance Against America and Aid Korea.
    Miao Kunyuan is also good at conducting propaganda based on the ideological situation of the masses. In September, new cotton was on the market, and the people's government, in order to purchase cotton, prohibited private merchants from stealing and buying at high prices. Some people were unclear about this matter. For example, Wang Heshun said, "If the state wants to buy cotton, who wouldn't sell if they offer a high price!" There were also individual households who were afraid of revealing their wealth and secretly hoarded cotton without selling. Miao Kunyuan conducted propaganda targeting these ideas. She first started with the comparison between the new and old societies to arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of the farmers, and then used accounting methods to explain the price ratio of grain and cotton, clarifying that this year's cotton price was even higher than last year's. If private merchants were not prohibited from stealing and buying at high prices, it would cause prices to rise, and farmers would suffer. After propaganda in people's schools, on the streets, and in various occasions, the masses' concerns and misconceptions were dispelled. Wang Shunhe and others enthusiastically sold cotton to the state. Miao Kunyuan then convened twenty women's meetings in different areas, mobilizing them by linking them to the women's vital interests. She also introduced the situation of her visit to textile factories in Tianjin to the women. The women were very enthusiastic about selling cotton. Elderly woman Li Min said, "After listening to your propaganda, I've gained new knowledge. Everyone should love the country, and workers and peasants are one family!"

     把“宣传”送到农民的炕头上
     孙启智
    中共河北省肃宁县寨南村支部妇女委员苗坤元，是党的宣传员，今年四十三岁啦。她只上过半年小学，她知道不努力学习，就不能做个好宣传员。她每天都去上民校，还要从工作和生产中挤出一两个钟头的时间，看报、看宣传员手册和学习文化课，把学习的东西，很快地向群众进行宣传。在村里开展普及深入抗美援朝运动的时候，她和宣传员王大瑞、韩玉兰研究好，动员了七个妇女干部和群众中的积极分子，组成宣传队，深入到妇女群众中去宣传。一天半的功夫就召开了二十二个小型座谈会，使二百一十七户，二百八十二个妇女受到抗美援朝的教育。有十二个妇女有特殊原因没有参加座谈会，苗坤元就深入到各家挨门访问，把“宣传”送到农民的炕头上。连刚生了孩子不能出门的张畔，患感冒的吕寿春家，也听到她的宣传，明白了抗美援朝的道理。这样，使全村广大妇女都受到两次到五次抗美援朝爱国主义的教育。
    苗坤元还善于根据群众的思想情况作宣传。九月里，新棉花上了市，人民政府为了收购棉花，禁止私商高价偷买。有些群众对这件事认识不清，比如王和顺说：“国家要买棉花，出大价钱，谁还不卖啊！”还有个别户怕露富，明存着棉花不卖。苗坤元就针对这些思想去进行宣传。她先从新旧社会的对比说起，激发农民的爱国热情，又用算账的办法讲清粮棉比价，说明今年比去年棉价还高，若不禁止私商高价偷买，会使物价上涨，农民吃亏。在民校里、街头上，及各种场合宣传后，解除了群众顾虑和错误想法。王顺和等踊跃把棉花卖给国家。苗坤元又分片召开了二十个妇女会，联系着妇女的切身利益，进行了动员。并把她在天津参观纺织工厂的情况，向妇女们作了介绍。妇女们售棉很踊跃。老年妇女李敏说：“听了你的宣传，长了新知识，人人应爱国，工农是一家啊！”
