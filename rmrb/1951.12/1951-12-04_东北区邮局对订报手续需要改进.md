    Northeast District Post Office Needs to Improve Newspaper Subscription Procedures
    The post offices (current business offices) in the Northeast District cannot directly request newspapers from the post offices that publish them. Each month, they must report the number of subscriptions to the Administrative Bureau before the 20th, and then the Administrative Bureau will uniformly request the newspapers from the publishing post offices. This requires the current business offices to request newspapers five or six days in advance. The post offices in various cities and counties are generally dissatisfied with this system, feeling that going through the Administrative Bureau is both troublesome and inconvenient for readers. The director of the Jilin City Post Office stated: Each month, the number of subscriptions and subscription fees must be submitted to the Administrative Bureau before the 20th; if either is missing, the newspapers will not be issued. The head of the distribution section of the Dalian City Post Office said: Each month, because the number of subscriptions and subscription fees must be submitted to the Administrative Bureau before the 20th, subscription fees must be collected in advance. However, most employees have not yet received their salaries and do not have money to pay the subscription fees, so they have to suspend their subscriptions and resubscribe after they receive their salaries. This makes the employees very dissatisfied with the work of the post office.
    At the same time, many post offices still have unreasonable restrictions on subscription periods. The Anshan City Post Office stipulates that regardless of when a subscription is placed, newspapers can only start being delivered on the 5th, 15th, or 25th of the month. The Jiaohe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Jilin Province subscribed to the People's Daily, but the post office stopped delivering the newspaper when the subscription expired without collecting the fee. Because there was a fixed subscription period, the newspaper was not delivered until the 15th of the following month. A reporter from the Northeast Daily stationed in Jilin wanted to subscribe to the People's Daily, but because it was past the 20th, he could not subscribe to the next month's newspaper.
    In the above-mentioned areas, readers need to wait a long time to see the newspaper after subscribing to it from the post office. On the post office's side, adding a subscription requires several layers of procedures, which is not only a waste of time but also inconvenient in terms of work. In particular, prematurely collecting subscription fees from readers or restricting readers to subscribe within a certain period has a great impact on the development of distribution work. It is hoped that the Northeast District Postal and Telecommunications Administration Bureau can study and improve this.   Zhao Wei

### 东北区邮局对订报手续需要改进

    东北区邮局对订报手续需要改进
    东北区各邮局（现业局）不能直接向发报的邮局要报，每月必须在二十日以前将报数报到管理局，再由管理局统一向发报的邮局要报。这样各现业局须提前五、六天要报。各市、县的邮局普遍对这种制度不满，觉得经过管理局手续既麻烦，同时对读者又不方便。吉林市邮局局长表示：每月须在二十日以前把报数和报费一同交到管理局，缺一项就不发报。大连市邮局发行股长说：每月因为要在二十日以前把报数和报费交到管理局，必须提前收报费，但一般职工都还没有发工资，没钱交报费，只好停报，到发了工资以后再订。这样，就使职工们对邮局的工作很不满意。
    同时，很多邮局还存在着限期订报的不合理现象。鞍山市邮局规定：无论何时订报只能从五日、十五日、二十五日开始发报。中共吉林省蛟河县委订的人民日报，邮局到期没去收费，就把报纸给停了；因为订报有一定的期限，一直到下月十五日才把报纸送到。东北日报驻吉林记者想订一份人民日报，因为过了二十日，就订不到下月的报了。
    上述各地读者向邮局订一份报纸，需要等待很长时间才能看到报纸。这在邮局方面，增加一份报纸要转办几层手续，不仅浪费时间，而且在工作上也不方便。尤其是过早地向读者预收报费，或限期让读者订报，这对发行工作的开展是有很大影响的。希望东北区邮电管理局能研究改进。    赵伟
