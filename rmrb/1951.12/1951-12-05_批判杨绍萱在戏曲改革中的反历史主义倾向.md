A Summary of Readers' Letters to the Editor

    Since this newspaper published Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's article "On the Harmfulness of 'Literature for Literature, Art for Art'" on November 3rd, readers from all over the country have put forward their opinions. As of December 3rd, this newspaper has received 273 submissions from readers, including 67 from government cadres, 67 from school faculty and staff, 48 from the People's Liberation Army, 14 from literary and art workers, 10 from factory workers, 6 from journalists, 6 from medical workers, and 55 from others.

    With the exception of one reader, all other readers unanimously pointed out that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's artistic ideas and his attitude towards criticism are wrong.

    Regarding his artistic ideas, readers' opinions mainly focus on three points:

    Using mythology to allude to reality violates historical truth and fails to educate the people

    I. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan advocates that mythology can and should be used to allude to reality. He believes that alluding to Resist America, Aid Korea, and defend world peace in mythology meets the demands of the people today. This idea of confusing the lives of ancient people with our lives today violates historical materialism. It cannot give the characters and plots depicted in historical dramas a sense of reality, and the educational effect of the drama will inevitably be reduced. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's advocacy directly contradicts the State Council's instructions on opera reform work issued on May 5th. The instruction stated: "When revising old scripts, attention should be paid to avoiding violations of historical truth and the educational effect on the people." On May 7th, this newspaper's editorial "Pay Attention to Opera Reform Work" also clearly pointed out: "Historical events and figures should be evaluated according to the historical conditions at the time. We should not force the ancients to have the thoughts of modern people and do the things of modern people; nor should we make inappropriate comparisons between historical events and the people's revolutionary struggle today. If so, it would be a violation of history and incorrect." However, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's approach is a "lose-lose" method that ruins mythology and reduces the seriousness of real-world issues; it violates historical truth and fails to educate the people.

    Mythology is a product of humanity's infancy,
    and today's society cannot produce mythology

    II. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan advocates turning ancient myths into new democratic myths because he does not understand the origin and characteristics of mythology. Mythology is a product of humanity's infancy. It is impossible to create mythology today. Does Comrade Yang Shaoxuan believe that there can be myths of new democratic society, myths of socialist society, and even myths of communist society in the future? Myths reflecting the struggle lives of ancient people have certain uses for today's reality and can play a certain educational role for the people engaged in today's political struggle. We should cherish these simple and beautiful artistic creations of ancient people, modify them appropriately, develop their advantages, eliminate their shortcomings, and make them serve the people today. But it cannot replace all the literature and art that the people need today. Mythology cannot be a "cure-all"; mythology cannot become what Comrade Yang Shaoxuan envisions, merely a form that can be filled with any content without regard to historical conditions. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan compares Lu Xun's "Old Tales Retold" with his own "New Heavenly River Marriage" because he has not understood that the past and present are different in terms of conditions. Writers using mythological dramas or historical dramas to allude to reality was a forced method of combat during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and they once played a certain progressive role. However, today's social conditions have completely changed, so continuing to adopt outdated methods is not only meaningless but will also be harmful to the people.

    The root cause of Yang Shaoxuan's artistic errors is
    underestimating the artistic creation ability of working people

    III. One of the root causes of Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's artistic errors is the idea of underestimating the artistic creation ability of the working people. He believes that ancient working people did not have the opportunity to receive cultural education, so there is no need to talk about high literary and artistic levels. Therefore, he lacks due respect for the artistic creation ability of ancient working people. This is a concrete manifestation of a lack of mass perspective and patriotism.

    Yang Shaoxuan's attitude towards criticism is bad
    and he should deeply examine his thinking

    Regarding the attitude towards criticism, readers' opinions mainly focus on four points:

    I. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said that Comrade Ai Qing is "incompetent and ignorant," "lying through his teeth," "pointing the gun inward, helping the enemy," and "attacking anti-US and Aid Korea opera workers, helping the US imperialist Truman," etc. all demonstrate that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan is "not considering calmly, but maliciously retaliating." He is "bitter and sarcastic, scolding and cursing, in a shrewish manner." "[He] has lost the spirit of revolutionary comrades researching and discussing issues."

    II. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's statement that "people with a sense of justice dare not speak out even if they know it. Those who sail with the wind will naturally praise it" is a statement that loses its stance. It is an unreasonable resistance to criticism and a slander against serious literary and artistic ideological struggle.

    III. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's bad attitude towards criticism is due to his "high and complacent emotions, resulting in using emotion to replace policy and treating friends as enemies." "He is arrogant and self-important, believing that his adaptation of 'New Heavenly River Marriage' is a masterpiece, so he does not allow anyone to criticize it."

    IV. "Our era is no longer an era of 'mutual contempt among writers.' What we need is criticism and self-criticism with a correct attitude and viewpoint." "Comrade Xiao Yemu's attitude towards criticism is correct. He humbly made a self-criticism and expressed his willingness to earnestly correct his mistakes. This attitude is an attitude that a revolutionary literary and art worker should have. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's attitude is bad." Therefore, readers
    unanimously believe that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan must make a deep self-criticism. "If he is a senior cadre or joined the revolution before liberation, he should examine himself more deeply."

### 批判杨绍萱在戏曲改革中的反历史主义倾向
本报读者来信综述

专栏：

　　批判杨绍萱在戏曲改革中的反历史主义倾向
　　本报读者来信综述
    本报自十一月三日发表杨绍萱同志的“论‘为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术’的危害性”一文后，各地读者纷纷提出意见。截至十二月三日止，本报已收到读者来稿、来信二百七十三件。其中来自机关干部的六十七件，学校教职员的六十七件，人民解放军四十八件，文艺工作者十四件，工厂职工十件，新闻工作者六件，医务工作者六件，其他五十五件。
    除了一位读者外，其他读者都一致指出杨绍萱同志的艺术思想和他对待批评的态度都是有错误的。
    在艺术思想方面，读者们的意见主要有三点：
    用神话影射现实既违背历史真实，
    又收不到教育人民的效果
    一、杨绍萱同志主张可以用神话影射现实，而且也应该如此。他认为在神话中影射抗美援朝、保卫世界和平，是符合今天人民的要求的。这种把古人的生活和今天我们的生活混淆起来的思想，是违反历史唯物主义的。这样并不能使历史剧中所表现的人物和情节具有真实感，戏剧的教育效果必然减低。杨绍萱同志的这种主张刚好是和政务院五月五日对戏曲改革工作的指示相违反的。该指示说：“在修改旧有剧本时，应注意不违背历史的真实与对人民的教育的效果。”五月七日，本报社论“重视戏曲改革工作”也明确指出：“对历史事件和人物应根据当时的历史条件予以估价，既不应强使古人有今人的思想，做今人的事；更不应将历史事迹与今天人民的革命斗争作不适当的比拟。如果那样，就是违反历史的，不正确的。”而杨绍萱同志的做法却是一种“两败俱伤”的办法，既毁坏了神话，也降低了现实问题的严肃性；既违背历史的真实，又不能收到教育人民的效果。
    神话是人类幼年时期的产物，
    今天的社会不可能产生神话
    二、杨绍萱同志主张把古代神话故事变成新民主主义的神话故事，这是因为他不懂得神话的起源和特性。神话是人类幼年时期的产物。今天不可能再产生神话。难道杨绍萱同志认为今天可以有新民主主义社会的神话、社会主义社会的神话，将来还有共产主义社会的神话吗？反映古代人民斗争生活的神话，对于今天的现实是有它的一定的用处的，是能够对从事今天的政治斗争的人民，起一定的教育作用的。我们应该珍视这些古代人民的朴素美丽的艺术创造，加以适当的修改，发挥它的优点，剔除它的缺点，使它也能服务于今天的人民。但是它不能代替今天人民所需要的全部文艺。神话不可能是“万应散”，神话不可能成为杨绍萱同志所设想的那样，仅仅是一个形式，可以在里面装进任何内容，而不必顾到历史条件。杨绍萱同志把鲁迅先生的“故事新编”拿来和自己所写的“新天河配”相比，这是因为他没有弄清过去和现在的时代条件不同。作家用神话剧或历史剧影射现实，在国民党反动统治时期是一种不得已的战斗的方式，它们曾经发挥了一定的进步作用。但是今天的社会条件已经完全改变了，因此，继续采取过时了的方法，不但没有意义，而且会成为对人民有害的了。
    杨绍萱艺术思想错误的根源是
    轻视劳动人民艺术创作的才能
    三、杨绍萱同志的艺术思想错误的根源之一，是具有一种轻视劳动人民艺术创作才能的思想。他以为古代劳动人民没有受文化教育的机会，谈不到多么高的文学艺术水平，因此，他对古代劳动人民的艺术创作能力缺乏应有的尊重。这是一种缺乏群众观点和爱国主义精神的具体表现。
    杨绍萱对待批评的态度是恶劣
    的，应该深刻检查自己的思想
    在对待批评的态度方面，读者们的意见主要有四点：
    一、杨绍萱同志说艾青同志“低能无知”，“瞪着眼睛说瞎话”，“枪口对内，帮助敌人”，“打击的是抗美援朝戏曲工作者，帮助的是美帝国主义杜鲁门”等等，都说明了杨绍萱同志“不是冷静考虑，而是恶意报复”。他“尖酸刻薄，讽刺谩骂，是泼妇骂街姿态”。“已失去革命同志研究讨论问题的精神”。
    二、杨绍萱同志所说的“有正义感的人虽知之而不敢说。看风行船的人那自然为它吹嘘”，是失掉立场的话，是对于批评的一种无理的抗拒，也是对严肃的文艺思想斗争的一种诬蔑。
    三、杨绍萱同志对待批评的态度不好，是由于他“具有高傲自满情绪，结果以感情代替政策，把朋友当做敌人”。“他自高自大，认为他自己改编的‘新天河配’是杰作，因此不允许任何人对它批评”。
    四、“我们的时代，已不是‘文人相轻’的时代，我们需要的是态度端正、观点正确的批评和自我批评”。“像萧也牧同志对待批评所采取的态度是正确的，他虚心地作了检讨，并表示要切实改正错误，这种态度是一个革命的文艺工作者应有的态度。杨绍萱同志的态度则是恶劣的。”因此，读者们
    一致认为杨绍萱同志必须深刻检讨，“如果他是高级干部，或解放前参加革命的，就更应该深刻检讨自己”。
