Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, December 7th: TASS reports that the Executive Bureau of the All-India Peace Council held a meeting in Bombay from November 17th to 21st. The meeting passed a resolution on a campaign to collect signatures for the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a five-power peace pact.

The resolution stated: The vast majority of Indian residents have expressed their support for the World Peace Council and the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. To date, 1.5 million Indians have signed the World Peace Council's declaration, which is only a small portion of the vast population that supports the conclusion of this pact. The Executive Bureau of the All-India Peace Council decided to instruct the Secretariat to concentrate its efforts and intensify this movement. The Executive Bureau of the All-India Peace Council pointed out that wherever the World Peace Council's declaration reaches the people, it is always warmly welcomed. Therefore, the Executive Bureau is confident that it is possible to collect tens of millions of signatures for this noble cause.

In another resolution, the Executive Bureau of the All-India Peace Council called on all parties and social organizations to support the peace movement and to intensify the signature collection campaign before the parliamentary elections. The "Resolution on the Need to Expand the Peace Movement" pointed out: The measures implemented since the All-India Peace Conference, especially after the recent meeting of the Executive Bureau, have achieved extremely positive results. The achievements in expanding the peace committees in various provinces, as well as the preparations for the International Economic Conference, the All-India Cultural Circles' Conference for the Defense of Peace, the World Youth and Student Peace Festival, and the International Physicians' Conference for the Defense of Peace, are all proof.

After pointing out the difficulties encountered by peace advocates in their activities, the Executive Bureau suggested that the Secretariat immediately take measures to overcome them.

    决议说：绝大部分的印度居民纷纷表示支持世界和平理事会，支持缔结五大国和平公约。到现在为止，印度人在世界和平理事会的宣言上签名的已有一百五十万人，这不过是拥护缔结这一公约的广大居民中不大的一部分。全印和平理事会执行局决定责成秘书处集中力量，加紧这个运动。全印和平理事会执行局指出，凡是世界和平理事会的宣言能够达到人民手中的地方，这个宣言总是受到热烈的欢迎，因此执行局深信，为这个崇高的要求征集数千万个签名是可以办到的。
    全印和平理事会执行局在另一个决议中号召各党派和社会团体支持和平运动，在议会选举到来之前加紧进行征集签名的运动。“关于必须扩大和平运动的决议”指出：在全印和平大会以后、特别是在执行局最近的一次会议以后所实行的措施，获得了极其积极的成果，在扩大各省和平委员会方面所获得的成就，以及为国际经济会议、全印文化界保卫和平大会、世界青年与学生和平联欢节和国际医师保卫和平大会而进行的筹备工作，都是证明。
    执行局指出和平拥护者在活动中碰到的困难后，建议秘书处立即采取办法予以克服。
    全印和平理事会执行局会议通过下列各项决议：关于巩固各省和平委员会的决议、关于举行分会代表会议的决议、关于国际经济会议的决议、关于全印文化界保卫和平大会的决议、关于全印青年保卫和平大会的决议、关于全印妇女保卫和平大会的决议、关于国际医师保卫和平大会的决议、关于世界和平理事会决定的决议。
     【新华社十日讯】印度和巴基斯坦人民欢迎于一九五二年四月在莫斯科召开国际经济会议。据塔斯社讯：全印和平理事会执行局在十一月十七日到二十一日举行会议并通过决议，决议说：国际经济会议筹备委员会十月间所通过的关于召开国际经济会议的决议，已得到印度全国著名人士特别是加尔各答和孟买的工商界人士的支持。执行局欢迎这个决议，这个决议对印度的筹备工作将是有帮助的。执行局希望全印筹备委员会采取适当的措施，广为宣传这个决议。
    巴基斯坦许多商业家纷纷表示要参加这个会议。巴基斯坦制宪议会议员伊夫提卡鲁丁最近在喀喇蚩工商界举行的会议上演说，他说：这次会议的目的是扩大各国的和平合作与贸易关系。会议将规定新的合作方式，对于确立贸易关系有所贡献。伊夫提卡鲁丁说：巴基斯坦必须和其他国家发展这种贸易，因为这对我们是有益的。
