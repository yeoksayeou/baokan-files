Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 8th: Our front-line reporter reports: Soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently discovered the bodies of our captured soldiers who had been murdered by the enemy army when they recovered an unnamed height west of Keho-ri and east of Kinjo. The soldiers' bodies had many wounds, and their hands and feet were bound and tied to a tree. The dark purple blood had congealed with the tightly bound ropes. Soldier Yan Guihu and others recognized that these were soldiers of the Sixth Company of the same unit, who had been captured on November 7 when the enemy invaded the area.

Our captured personnel who escaped from the U.S. military and Rhee's "prisoner of war camps" angrily accused the enemy of atrocities in torturing and killing our captured personnel. Fan Chengsi, a soldier of a certain unit, said: "The enemy treats our captured personnel like beasts. After I was captured, I personally witnessed many soldiers being killed by the enemy. Liu Gaotang, the artillery squad leader of a certain unit of our army, who was captured in February of this year, was shot and killed by the 32nd Regiment of the Rhee army after being subjected to the enemy's torture." Soldiers Sun Shuai and Pan Shulin, who were captured and returned, said: "During the Second Battle, we witnessed with our own eyes that our comrade Kuang Defu was killed alive after being captured in the battle of Xia Tuanli."

Many Rhee soldiers captured by our army also confirmed that our captured personnel were subjected to inhuman killings by the enemy. Choi Jin-shin, a soldier of the 3rd Platoon, 7th Company, 2nd Battalion, 32nd Regiment of the Rhee Second Division, confessed that his platoon leader, Liu Han-yi, had told his subordinates: "All battlefield prisoners who cannot be taken down in time will be shot." He personally witnessed the atrocities of the American invaders collectively shooting our captured personnel. On November 6th last year, on the highway in Xiajieyuli, the U.S. Marine Corps First Division fiercely drove more than 100 of our captured personnel to a large tree, and then an American officer immediately issued an order to shoot, and several machine guns madly swept the crowd. Then they inspected, and if there were any who had not completely died, they would shoot them again with carbines. Kim Jae-ryong, a private second class of the 7th Company, 2nd Regiment, 6th Division of the Rhee army, confessed that on November 13, he personally saw two captured Volunteer Army soldiers tied with thick ropes in the southwest of Keho-ri. They were used as live targets by the Rhee army. On the 17th, when the enemy attacked the unnamed height west of Keho-ri, he saw another Volunteer Army soldier being tortured and killed. The Rhee army beat this soldier in every way, and then shot him with a rifle. The Volunteer Army soldier fell down, and the Rhee army went up and kicked his body until the soldier was completely dead. Wu Chenglong, a sergeant and guide of the 1st Platoon, 11th Company, 3rd Battalion, 31st Regiment of the Rhee Second Division, confessed that at 12:00 on July 30th this year, the reconnaissance team of the 3rd Battalion, 31st Regiment of the Rhee Second Division, dragged a captured Volunteer Army soldier to a mountain ditch 20 miles southeast of Jinhua. The Rhee army dug a pit there first, and then dragged the Volunteer Army soldier to the front of the pit and shot him. On October 4th this year, at a place 10 kilometers south of Kinjo, the reconnaissance team used the same method to brutally kill another Volunteer Army soldier.

    美李匪帮凶残无耻
    虐杀我军被俘人员
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本社前线记者报道：志愿军某部第三连的战士们最近在收复金城以东科湖里以西一个无名高地上，发现敌军残杀我军被俘战士的尸体。战士的身上有许多伤痕，手脚都被捆绑，并被拴在一棵树上。黑紫色的血已和绑得紧紧的绳子凝结在一起。战士阎贵虎等认出这是该部第六连的战士，他是在十一月七日敌人侵占该地时被俘的。
    从美军和李伪军的“俘虏营”里逃出来的我军被俘人员，都愤怒地控诉敌人虐杀我军被俘人员的暴行。某部战士范成思说：“敌人像野兽一般地对待我军被俘人员。我被俘后，曾亲眼看到许多战士被敌人杀害。在今年二月被俘的我军某部炮兵班长刘高堂，在受尽敌人的拷打后，被李伪军三十二联队枪杀。”被俘后逃回来的战士孙率、潘守林说：“第二次战役时，我们亲眼看见战友匡德福在下团里战斗中，在被俘掳后就被活活杀死。”
    许多被我军俘掳的李伪军士兵，也证实我军被俘人员遭到敌人惨无人道的杀害。李伪军第二师第三十二联队第二大队第七中队第三小队士兵崔珍槙供认他的小队长刘汉毅曾告诉他的部下说：“战场俘虏来不及带下来的一律枪杀。”他曾亲眼看到美国侵略军集体枪杀我军被俘人员的暴行。去年十一月六日在下碣隅里的公路上，美国侵略军海军陆战队第
    一师凶恶地将一百多个我军被俘人员赶到一座大树下以后，一个美军军官立即发出射击的命令，几挺机关枪就对着人群猛烈扫射。然后他们再进行检查，如有还没有完全断气的，就再用卡宾枪射击。李伪军第六师第二联队第七中队二等兵金再龙供称：十一月十三日，他在科湖里西南亲眼看到两个被俘的志愿军战士身上捆着粗粗的绳子。他们被李伪军当作活靶。十七日敌人进攻科湖里以西无名高地时，他又看到一个志愿军战士被虐杀。李伪军把这个战士百般殴打，接着用步枪射击。志愿军战士倒下去了，李伪军便走上去用脚踢他的身体，直到那个战士完全气绝。李伪军第二师第三十一联队第三大队第十一中队第一小队向导中士吴成龙供称：今年七月三十日十二时李伪军第二师第三十一联队第三大队的侦察队，曾在金化东南二十里处把被俘的一个志愿军战士拖到山沟里。李伪军在那里先挖了一个坑，然后把志愿军战士拖到坑前枪杀了。今年十月四日在金城以南十公里处，该侦察队以同样的办法残杀了另一个志愿军战士。
