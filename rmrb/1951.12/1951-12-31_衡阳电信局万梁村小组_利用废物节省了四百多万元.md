    Hengyang Telecommunications Bureau Wanliang Village Team
    Saves More Than Four Million Yuan by Utilizing Waste Materials

    Comrade Editor: The Wanliang Village Team of the Hengyang Telecommunications Bureau has achieved remarkable results in the production increase and economy campaign. Once, worker Gong Yunfeng and others said in the team, "We use more than one hundred catties of card tacks for each project. Now there are many waste iron wires piled up in the material warehouse. If we use them to make card tacks, can't we save a lot of money?" This suggestion reminded everyone. They went to the waste pile in the material warehouse and found a large number of four-millimeter waste iron wires and waste telephone outer wires, and used their spare time every day to manufacture card tacks. Within fifteen days, they manufactured more than sixty catties of card tacks. These card tacks are of good quality and as durable as new card tacks. Calculated at 30,000 yuan per catty, they saved the country more than 1.8 million yuan of wealth. They also sorted out that batch of waste telephone outer wires, which is estimated to save more than 3 million yuan. Now, this team is planning to save 40 million yuan in card tack expenses in 1952 to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    衡阳电信局万梁村小组
    利用废物节省了四百多万元
    编辑同志：衡阳电信局万梁村小组在增产节约运动中，创造了显著的成绩。有一次，工人龚云峰等在小组里说：“我们做一次工程，要用一百多斤卡钉。现在材料库里堆着很多废铁线，如果用它制成卡钉，不是可以节约一大笔钱吗？”这一个建议把大家提醒了。他们到材料库废料堆里，找出了大批四公厘的废铁线和废电话皮线，利用每天的工余时间，制造卡钉。十五天内，他们制造了六十多斤卡钉。这些卡钉质量很好，和新的卡钉一样耐用。若以每斤三万元计算，就替国家节省了一百八十多万元的财富。他们并整理好那批废电话皮线，估计又可以节省三百万元以上。现在，这个小组正在计划一九五二年度要节省卡钉费四千万元，支持中国人民志愿军。        曹洪增
