In the Asset Clearance Work
    Nanjing Wired Electrical Plant Carried Out an Ideological Struggle Against Waste
    By our special correspondent Ji Yin
    The work of clearing assets and verifying funds has greatly advanced the business management of most state-owned and public enterprises in Nanjing. The Nanjing Wired Electrical Plant is one of these enterprises.
    The Wired Electrical Plant is a relatively advanced factory in Nanjing. In the past two years, the plant's production has continuously improved. Last year's annual task was completed in ten months, and this year's annual task was completed in nine months. The production volume for the first nine months of this year is equivalent to the total production volume of the past ten years. The plant has developed greatly in the past two years, and the number of workers has more than doubled. However, due to the supply system mentality of many cadres and workers, there is serious waste in production. A large number of machines, tools, and materials have become stagnant, there is a lot of waste of raw materials, many defective products and substandard goods, and extremely serious rework. According to the statistics in this asset clearance, a total of 10.5 billion yuan of funds have been tied up.
    In August, the Wired Electrical Plant began to carry out the work of clearing assets and verifying funds. By early October, the inventory work was basically completed. Through this work, many serious problems in business management were exposed. The entire plant, from top to bottom, was shocked, and the serious complacency was basically eliminated. Everyone began to know their "family property" and found the problems in production and the direction for improvement. Through this work, the masses were mobilized once again. After the inventory work was completed, the entire plant's employees launched a movement to eliminate waste. In just over twenty days, employees put forward 134 rationalization proposals and came up with various ways to eliminate waste. All employees actively handled the accumulated waste materials piled up like mountains. So far, they have sold waste materials worth more than 600 million yuan. The plant's "small warehouses" have basically been eliminated. Various new systems required in production, some have been established and are already effective; others are being established. In short, the successful completion of the inventory stage has laid a good material and ideological foundation for the Wired Electrical Plant to correctly carry out appraisal and valuation and fund verification work.
    Fully prepare ideologically, organizationally, and technically
    Clearing assets and verifying funds is a very complicated task. Therefore, doing a good job of preparation is a decisive link in doing this work well. The Wired Electrical Plant's inventory work lasted for one and a half months, most of which was preparation work, and the actual inventory time was very short. The preparation work mainly consists of three parts: ideological preparation, organizational preparation, and technical preparation.
    After the work of clearing assets and verifying funds began, it encountered various ideological obstacles. The basic problem was that many cadres and workers did not pay attention to this work. Therefore, the Wired Electrical Plant launched a study on clearing assets and verifying funds. This study was divided into three stages. The first stage was a study by all members of the Fund Verification Committee, mainly studying the People's Daily editorials "Fund Verification Requires Ideological Struggle" and "Clearing Assets and Verifying Funds is the First Step in Implementing Economic Accounting System" and the two provisional measures on fund verification work issued by the Government Administration Council. The second stage was a study by the forty-eight cadres participating in the inventory in each group. The third stage was a widespread mobilization and study throughout the plant. In this way, from top to bottom, step by step, the ideology was cleared, and various ideological obstacles were eliminated. In terms of organizational preparation, the Wired Electrical Plant established a tightly stratified leadership organization, implemented the principle of major administrative cadres taking action personally, and selected engineers, accounting section chiefs, and forty-eight experienced workers to participate in the work of clearing assets and verifying funds. After completing the organizational preparation, a detailed work plan was drawn up, and various technical preparations were completed.
    Break through the "fortress," summarize experience, and promote the entire plant
    In order to prevent the inventory work from taking detours, the Wired Electrical Plant selected the Fifth Workshop as a typical example for experimentation while launching the study. The Fifth Workshop is the last step in the telephone production process, and the parts from each workshop are finally concentrated here for assembly, so waste is also the most concentrated and prominent. The "small warehouse" of this workshop is known as the "fortress" of tied-up funds in the entire plant, with 380,000 single components tied up, of which 280,000 were qualified, with a total tied-up fund value of 684.48 million yuan; the loss of waste materials and fund interest was 200.8 million yuan in nine months. Therefore, the problems of the Fifth Workshop have universal significance for each workshop.
    Before the inventory work began, the plant director and chief engineer mobilized the Fifth Workshop. The entire workshop's workers enthusiastically studied. At the same time, under the leadership of the plant's Asset Clearance and Fund Verification Committee, a clearing team for the Fifth Workshop was established. The Fifth Workshop has a particularly large number of equipment parts. To avoid confusion during the inventory, a streamlined operation method was adopted - division of labor and cooperation according to the original work nature. For example, the winding group workers organized enameled wire, and the finished product group organized finished products. In this way, the organizers were experts, both fast and accurate. The inventory was carried out during the workers' spare time in the evening. More than ninety workers in the entire workshop participated, with extremely high enthusiasm. As a result, the workers cleaned up all 380,000 single components in the entire workshop in four nights. Then, the plant held a small anti-waste exhibition, exhibiting the serious waste phenomena such as the backlog of more than 600 million yuan of funds found in the inventory with real objects and pictures and texts, and inviting workers from each workshop to visit during their spare time every night.
    After the inventory of the Fifth Workshop was completed, the leading cadres summarized the experience and launched the inventory work throughout the plant. In this way, the work progressed quickly, and the entire plant basically completed it in just one week.
    Closely combine anti-waste education and launch ideological struggle
    Clearing assets and verifying funds is not a purely technical work, it is a sharp ideological struggle between socialist thought and various conservative thoughts in the enterprise. Only by fully launching this ideological struggle and raising all the plant personnel ideologically can the work of clearing assets and verifying funds be done well. The Wired Electrical Plant closely combined anti-waste education in the clearing work, and the asset clearing work truly became a mass battle against conservative and backward thinking, so the problems were excavated more deeply, and the gains were greater.
    The Wired Electrical Plant successively held two anti-waste exhibitions, using vivid facts to make a comprehensive and powerful exposure of various harmful thoughts. The exhibition pointed out: The supply system mentality is the biggest cause of waste, which has turned a large number of machines, tools, and materials into stagnant materials. The exhibition pointed out: The lack of a sense of ownership of workers and technicians also causes waste. In the past ten months, due to the large number of defective products, substandard goods, and rework, the loss was more than 430 million yuan; many good materials were found in the waste pile, and the good enameled wire alone was worth 37.338 million yuan. The exhibition pointed out: The disconnection between technology and labor also causes waste. Technicians do not consult with workers, and workers do not make suggestions, resulting in design errors and waste of more than 190 million yuan. The exhibition pointed out: A pure task viewpoint also causes waste. Workers only want to exceed their personal plans, work hard, and do not care about the damage to materials; the busier the production task, the faster the number of parts to be repaired and defective products in the "small warehouse" increases. As a result, the small warehouse of the Fifth Workshop alone tied up more than 600 million yuan of funds. Workers are creating wealth on the one hand, but wasting wealth on the other! The exhibition pointed out: The backward thinking of conservative quotas also causes waste. For example, the Li Yongheng team has actually polished 8,000 screws; but when the manufacturing department set a quota of 2,000 for them, they still called it "heavy work"; the actual capacity they used was less than a quarter, resulting in a waste of 44.4 million yuan in three months. The exhibition pointed out: Disunity also causes waste. For example, the eight masters in charge of painting used to be disunited and unwilling to lend spray guns (painting tools) to each other, so each had to buy one. Now that unity has been improved, three guns are enough, and the remaining five have become stagnant materials.
    Anti-waste studies were universally held in various workshops throughout the plant, and a fierce ideological struggle was launched. Many workshops carried out digging roots and calculating accounts to check the ideological roots that caused waste. Female worker Qian Suzhen said sadly: "I spent 50,000 yuan to make a new cheongsam, and I felt pain for a long time when I accidentally tore a hole; I broke a transmitter-receiver in my work, worth 58,000 yuan, and I didn't feel any pain. What kind of thinking is this!" Worker Li Shiqing said: "I thought that waste was always inevitable in large-scale production, so I relaxed ideologically. Today, I calculated that I have wasted 1.5 billion yuan!" Many workers examined that their past sense of ownership was vague, and they also thought that "the public is the big boss." Originally, workers were unwilling to hand over extra tools, but after anti-waste education, they also handed them over. The attitude of employees has been significantly improved, and the concept of cost has also been established. In the past, it was considered okay to lose small things, but now when a piece of copper falls on the ground, they immediately think that it is worth more than 2,000 yuan and hurry up to pick it up. Defective products, substandard goods, and rework have also been greatly reduced. In short, various conservative ideas and practices have completely lost ground among the masses. In this way, the clearing work not only made a major reversal of stagnant materials and waste materials throughout the plant, but also made a major reversal of the thinking of all employees.
    Combine asset clearing with work improvement
    The work of clearing assets is not just a simple inventory work, it should not only use the problems found in the inventory to educate workers in a timely manner, but also further point out the active direction of eliminating waste to workers and further organize workers to avoid losses. After the Wired Electrical Plant discovered a large number of waste phenomena in the asset clearing, it organized everyone to deal with it while taking inventory. For example, more than 25,000 boxes for microphones were cleared out. In the past, when they piled up too much, they would hire people to burn them. This time, they were sold for 200 yuan each, with an income of more than 5 million yuan; in the past, the wooden shafts of enameled wire were also discarded in large quantities, and now they are sold for 600 yuan each, with an income of more than 6 million yuan. The waste materials piled up for years have now been sold for more than 600 million yuan. Many things that can be repaired have been repaired. More than 400,000 pieces to be repaired collected from various "small warehouses" are now being contracted by the trade union and the administrative side, and all employees will be mobilized to handle them.
    After the inventory was completed, the anti-waste exhibition in the entire plant also specially set up a "Waste Material Utilization Hall" and a "Technical Improvement Hall." The "Waste Material Utilization Hall" displayed all the types of waste materials in the plant, with a large character hanging on it: "Think about how to turn waste materials into useful materials?" The "Technical Improvement Hall" exhibited the great achievements of all the plant's employees in proposing rationalization suggestions and improving production in the past two years, guiding workers and technicians to study and improve their work. Workers often gathered in the hall all night for heated discussions. On the first day of the exhibition, 22 suggestions for utilizing waste materials were received from 12 workers. In less than a month, workers and technicians put forward a total of 134 rationalization proposals, and put forward many valuable opinions on how to save raw materials and improve working methods. Many suggestions have been adopted, of which the 17 suggestions adopted by the Jiang Hanmin team alone can save 15.94 million yuan in one month. The rest are now being reviewed and evaluated.
    The close combination of asset clearing and anti-waste education in the Wired Electrical Plant has basically cleared the way for the next appraisal and valuation and fund verification work of the plant. Now, the plant has started the appraisal and valuation work on this basis.

    在清理资产工作中
    南京有线电厂开展了反浪费的思想斗争
    本报特约记者　季　音
    清理资产核定资金工作使南京大部分国营和公营企业的经营管理工作前进了一大步。南京有线电厂就是这些企业中的一个。
    有线电厂是南京一个比较先进的工厂。二年来，这个厂的生产不断提高。去年全年任务十个月完成，今年全年任务九个月就完成了。今年九个月的生产量，相当于过去十年的总生产量。二年来，这个厂有很大的发展，工人增加了一倍以上。但是由于不少干部和工人有着供给制思想，生产中有严重的浪费现象。大量的机器、工具、材料变成呆料，原材料的浪费很大，废品、次货很多，返工现象也极严重。据这次清理资产中的统计，共积压资金一百零五亿元。
    八月间，有线电厂开始进行清理资产核定资金工作。到十月上旬，基本结束了清点工作。经过这个工作，暴露了企业经营中的许多严重问题。全厂从上到下，人人震惊，基本上扫除了严重的自满情绪。大家开始知道了自己的“家底子”，摸到了生产中的问题所在和改进的方向。通过这个工作，又一次发动了群众。清点工作结束后，全厂职工掀起了消灭浪费运动。二十几天中，职工们提出了一百三十四件合理化建议，想出了各种消灭浪费的办法。全厂职工积极处理积压经年堆积如山的废料。到目前为止，他们已售出了价值六亿多元的废料。全厂“小仓库”基本上已被消灭。各种生产中所需的新制度，有的已订立并已行之有效；有的正在订立。总之，清点阶段的顺利完成，已给有线电厂正确地做好鉴定估价和核定资金工作打下了良好的物质和思想基础。
    充分地做好思想上组织上和技术上的准备工作
    清理资产核定资金工作是一个十分繁复的工作。因此，作好准备工作，是做好这个工作的决定性的一环。有线电厂的清点工作共进行了一个半月，其中大部分时间是准备工作，实际清点时间很短。准备工作主要是三部分：思想准备，组织准备，技术准备。
    清理资产核定资金工作开始后，就遇到种种的思想障碍。基本问题是许多干部和工人对这个工作不重视。因此，有线电厂便展开了关于清理资产核定资金的学习。这个学习分三个阶段。第一阶段是核定资金委员会全体委员学习，主要是学习人民日报
    “核定资金要展开思想斗争”和“清理资产核定资金是实行经济核算制的第一步”两篇社论和政务院两个关于核定资金工作的暂行办法。第二阶段是参加清点的各组的四十八个干事学习。第三阶段是全厂普遍动员展开学习。这样从上到下，一步步地打通思想，扫除各种思想障碍。在组织准备方面，有线电厂建立了严密分层的领导机构，贯彻了主要行政干部亲自动手的方针；并抽调工程师、会计课长和四十八个有经验的工人，参加清理资产核定资金工作。在完成组织准备之后，就拟出周密的工作计划，完成各种技术准备。
    突破“堡垒”，总结经验，推动全厂
    为了使清点工作不走弯路，有线电厂在展开学习的同时，就选择了第五工场作为典型进行试验。第五工场是电话机生产过程的最后一关，各工场的零件最后都集中到这里来装配，因此浪费也最集中突出。这个工场的“小仓库”被称为全厂积压资金的
    “堡垒”，积压了单组件三十八万件，其中合格的就有二十八万件，积压资金总值六亿八千四百多万元；废料和资金利息的损失，九个月就有二亿零八百多万元。因此，第五工场的问题对各工场都有普遍的意义。
    清点工作开始前，厂长和总工程师都对第五工场作了动员。全场工人热烈地进行了学习。同时在厂的清理资产核定资金委员会领导下成立了第五工场的清理小组。第五工场器材零件特别多，为避免在清点时混乱，便采取了流水作业办法——按照原来工作性质分工合作。如绕线组工人就整理漆包线，成品组就整理成品。这样，整理的人内行，既快又准确。清点是在工余的晚上进行的。全场九十多个工人都参加，情绪极高。结果，工人用四个晚上就把全场三十八万件单组件清理完毕。接着，这个厂举办了一个小型反浪费展览会，把清点中发现的六亿多资金的积压等严重浪费现象一一用实物和图片文字展览出来，每晚工余时间招待各工场工人参观。
    第五工场清点结束后，领导干部总结了经验，便在全厂展开清点工作。这样，工作进展很快，仅一星期全厂就基本结束了。
    紧紧结合反浪费教育，展开思想斗争
    清理资产核定资金工作不是单纯的技术工作，它是社会主义思想和企业中各种守旧思想的一场尖锐的思想斗争。只有充分地展开这种思想斗争，把全厂人员从思想上提高一步，才能把清理资产核定资金工作做好。有线电厂在清理工作中紧紧结合反浪费教育，清理资产工作真正成了群众性的向保守落后思想的一场交战，因而问题就发掘得比较深刻，收获也就比较大。
    有线电厂先后举行了两次反浪费展览会，用活生生的事实给各种有害思想作了全面的有力的揭发。展览会指出了：供给制思想是造成浪费的最大原因，它使大量的机器、工具、材料变成了呆料。展览会指出了：工人和技术人员主人翁思想的缺乏，也造成浪费。十个月来，由于废品、次货和返工活多，损失四亿三千多万元；废料堆里找出了许多好材料，仅找出的好漆包线一项就值三千七百三十八万元。展览会指出了：技术和劳动脱节也造成浪费。技术人员不和工人商量，工人也不提意见，结果设计错误，浪费一亿九千多万元。展览会指出了：单纯任务观点也造成浪费。工人们只图超出个人计划，拚命赶活，不管材料的损坏；生产任务越忙，“小仓库”里的待修件和废品增加得越快。结果仅第五工场的小仓库就积压了六亿多资金，工人一面在创造财富，一面却在浪费财富！展览会指出了：定额保守的落后思想也造成了浪费。例如李永衡小组做车螺丝抛光，实际已经做到八千只；但当制造部门给他们定额二千只时，他们还叫“工作重”；他们实际用出的能力还不到四分之一，结果三个月工时浪费就是四千四百多万元。展览会指出了：不团结也造成浪费，例如负责喷漆的八个老师傅过去闹不团结，互相不肯借喷漆枪（喷漆的工具），结果只好每人买一杆。现在团结搞好了，三把枪足够用了，剩下五把就成了呆料。
    全厂各车间普遍举行反浪费学习，展开了激烈的思想斗争。许多车间进行了挖根算账，检查造成浪费的思想根源。女工钱素贞沉痛地说：“我花五万元做了件新旗袍，不小心挂破一个洞，心痛了半天；我在工作中跌坏一只传受话器，值五万八千元，心里一点也不痛。这是什么思想！”工人李士清说：“我以为在大生产中浪费总是难免的，思想上就松懈了。今天算算竟浪费了十五亿元！”许多工人检查出自己过去主人翁的思想模糊，还认为“公家是大亨们的”。原来工人不肯交出多余的工具，经过反浪费教育后，也交出来了。在清点时最初管库房的人不肯收废品，现在也收了。职工们的工作态度显著改进，成本观念也树立了。过去认为丢些小东西无所谓，现在地上掉一片铜片，立刻想到它价值二千多元，赶快拾起来。废品、次货和返工活也大为减少。总之，各种守旧的思想和做法已完全在群众中失去阵地。这样，清理工作不仅使全厂呆料废料大翻身，而且使全厂职工思想大翻身。
        清点资产和改进工作相结合
    清点资产工作不只是一个单纯的点验工作，它不仅应该用点验中发现的问题及时教育工人，更应该进一步向工人指出消灭浪费的积极方向，进一步组织工人去避免损失。有线电厂在清理资产中发现大量浪费现象后，就组织大家一面清点一面处理。例如清点出来的二万五千多只装话筒的盒子，过去堆得多了就雇人烧掉，这次以二百元一只的价钱卖了，收入五百多万元；过去漆包线的木轴也是大量遗弃的，现在以六百元一只卖出，收入了六百多万元。堆积经年的废料，现已陆续卖了六亿多元。许多可修的东西都被修理了起来。从各“小仓库”集中起来的四十多万件待修件，现在正由工会和行政方面订立合同，就要发动全厂职工动手处理。
    清点结束后，在全厂反浪费展览会上，又专门设立了“废料利用馆”和“技术改进馆”。“废料利用馆”里陈列了厂里所有的废料种类，上挂一幅大字：“想想看，怎样变废料为有用之料？”“技术改进馆”里展览了全厂职工二年来提出合理化建议改进生产的巨大成就，引导工人和技术人员研究改进工作。工人们常整晚聚集在馆内热烈讨论。展览会第一天，就收到了十二个工人提出的二十二件利用废料的建议。不到一月，工人和技术人员共提出了一百三十四条合理化建议，对如何节约原材料、改进工作方法等提出了许多宝贵意见，有不少建议已被采用，其中仅蒋汉民小组被采用的十七件建议一个月内就能节省一千五百九十四万元。其余的现在正在加紧审查评议中。
    有线电厂的清点资产和反浪费教育的紧紧结合，基本上已给这个厂下一步的鉴定估价和核定资金工作扫清了道路。现在，这个工厂已在这基础上开始鉴定估价工作。
