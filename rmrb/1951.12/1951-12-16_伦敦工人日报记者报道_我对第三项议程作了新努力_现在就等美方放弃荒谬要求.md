Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," reported from Panmunjom on the 14th: The Korean and Chinese side made a new effort today to expedite the resolution of the third agenda item, agreeing to rotate troops, but not exceeding 5,000 people per month. Today's proposal also contains several points that could help achieve a decision and ceasefire at an early date. The proposal stipulates that the ceasefire should take effect within 24 hours after the signing of the armistice agreement. The US side vaguely stated that the ceasefire should take effect when the Armistice Commission has sufficient staff and is ready to start work. The Korean and Chinese side suggested that the neutral nations' "supervisory commission" should be an independent body, and suggested giving it various powers, unlike the US side's vague plan to have the neutral nations' inspection teams act as errand boys for the belligerent parties. The neutral nations' inspection teams should also have the right to investigate violations of the agreement outside the demilitarized zone. Now we await the US side to abandon their obviously unacceptable demands to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea, and to abandon their demands to strengthen their military forces under the pretext of replenishing equipment. Today, Hodge clearly demonstrated the absurdity of this demand. When cornered, Hodge said that withdrawing 40 unusable T-34 tanks and bringing in 40 usable T-34 tanks is not strengthening forces. It is very clear that withdrawing unusable tanks and bringing in usable tanks is strengthening forces. On the issue of prisoners of war, the US side still refuses to discuss the issue, and is willing to conduct discussions only after the Korean and Chinese side agrees to their demand to allow the Red Cross to inspect prisoner-of-war camps and provide them with technical materials. The Korean and Chinese side reiterated to them that the agenda does not stipulate that any party has the right to refuse to discuss substantive issues and principles before determining details. Therefore, because the US side refuses to state whether they agree to the Korean and Chinese side's proposed immediate release of all prisoners of war, and refuses to state what they want to do if they disagree - due to this situation, the issue of prisoners of war - along with the entire agenda - is at a standstill. In the past few days, negotiations have been conducted under very heavy artillery fire in the Panmunjom area. Even Ridgway admitted that this recent attack met with "considerable resistance." The fact is that a battalion of Syngman Rhee's bandit troops, which crossed the Sagawon River to attack, was repulsed with heavy losses. If the US side still doesn't know that they cannot use such means to influence the negotiations, then their allies should now order them to stop fooling around and seek peace here before Christmas.

    我对第三项议程作了新努力
    现在就等美方放弃荒谬要求
    【新华社十五日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿十四日自板门店报道：朝中方面今天为了加速解决第三项议程作了一次新的努力，同意轮换军队，但每月不得超过五千人。今天的建议中尚有可以帮助早日获致决定和停火的几点。建议规定，在停战协议签字后二十四小时内就应停火。美方含糊地说道，停火应在停战委员会有了充分的工作人员、准备好开始工作时生效。朝中方面建议，中立国的“监察委员会”应为独立的机构，并建议赋予它各种权力，而不像美方的那种含糊计划那样让中立国视察小组作交战方面的跑差的。中立国视察小组也应有权调查在非军事区外违反协议的事件。现在就等美方放弃他们干涉朝鲜内政的显然不能接受的要求，和放弃在补充装备的藉口下增强他们军事力量的要求了。今天霍治清楚表明了这种要求的荒谬性，霍治在被逼得毫无办法时说道，撤出四十辆不能用的T三十四型坦克，输进四十辆能用的T三十四型坦克，并不是增强力量。很清楚，撤走不能用的坦克而输进能用的坦克，这是增强了力量。在战俘问题上，美方仍拒绝讨论问题，要等朝中方面答应他们的要求准许红十字会视察俘虏营并交给他们技术材料后才愿进行讨论。朝中方面再度告诉他们说，议程上并没有规定任何一方面有权拒绝在确定细节问题以前讨论实质问题和原则。因此，由于美方拒绝说明他们是否同意朝中方面提出的立即释放全部战俘的要求，拒绝说明假如他们不同意的话他们想怎么办——由于这种情况，战俘问题——连同整个议程——正陷于停顿。过去数天，谈判是在板门店地区炮火非常猛烈的情况下进行的。甚至李奇微也招认最近这次攻击遭到“相当大的抵抗”。事情是，渡过此间砂川河进攻的李承晚匪军一个营被击退，损失惨重。假如美方还不知道他们不能施展这种手段来影响谈判，那么他们的盟国现在似乎应该吩咐他们不要再胡闹，而要在圣诞节前在这里求得和平了。
