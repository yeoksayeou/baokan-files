    Jiangxi Nanchang Jianchang Sawmill
    Illegal Timber Trading Should be Investigated
    Editor: The Jianchang Sawmill in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, is a joint venture between the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and businessman Zhou Chongyuan (Zhou accounts for slightly less than a quarter of the capital). From July to September of this year, the sawmill illegally purchased more than two thousand taels of timber in Ji'an and transported it to Shanghai for sale. At that time, the government was strictly managing the timber market, and the Finance and Economic Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government also issued "Regulations on Several Issues Concerning Timber Management," prohibiting state-owned enterprises or organizations from rushing to purchase timber on the market, and private merchants were also prohibited from transporting and selling it outside the province. However, the Jianchang Sawmill took the lead in purchasing and transporting large quantities in Ji'an, opening the way for private merchants and creating instability in market prices. It is understood that from April to September of this year, the Jianchang Sawmill was not subject to the People's Bank's cash management, which is one of the reasons why the Jianchang Sawmill could freely purchase timber. I believe that this practice of the Jianchang Sawmill is in violation of government decrees. I suggest that relevant authorities conduct an investigation into the Jianchang Sawmill, deal with those who violate the law, and reorganize the institution.

### 江西南昌市建昌锯木厂  违法买卖木材应作检查

    江西南昌市建昌锯木厂
    违法买卖木材应作检查
    编辑同志：江西省南昌市建昌锯木厂是江西省商业厅、农林厅和商人周重远合资经营（周占资金四分之一弱）的加工制材厂。这个锯木厂从今年七月到九月，违法在吉安购买了两千多两木材运往上海出售。当时正是政府对木材市场严格管理时期，而且江西省人民政府财政经济委员会也发布“关于木材经营几个问题的规定”，不准公营企业或机关团体在市场上抢购木材，私商也不能往外运销。而建昌锯木厂竟带头在吉安大量采购运销，给私商打开道路，同时并造成了市场价格的不平稳。据了解，建昌锯木厂自今年四月份到九月，就没有受到人民银行的现金管理，这也是使建昌锯木厂可以自由采购木材的原因之一。我认为建昌锯木厂这种作法是违反政府法令的。我建议有关机关对建昌锯木厂进行检查，处理违法人员，整顿机构。		丘邑
