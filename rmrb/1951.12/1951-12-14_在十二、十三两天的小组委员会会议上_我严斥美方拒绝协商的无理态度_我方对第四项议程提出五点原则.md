Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 13th: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks on the 13th, our representative sternly refuted the unreasonable attitude of the other side in refusing to negotiate to resolve differences of opinion between the two sides. Our representative pointed out that our side has consistently advocated convening a high-level political conference quickly after the armistice to completely peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Therefore, our side originally believed that there was no need for inspections in the rear of both sides during the armistice. However, because the other side feared our military strength and insisted on rear inspections, our side made major efforts to break the negotiation deadlock and formally proposed on December 3rd to invite neutral countries to establish a monitoring agency to conduct necessary inspections at rear ports agreed upon by both sides. However, the other side delayed for nine days and, on December 12th, put forward a so-called revised plan that still insisted on interfering in our internal affairs, demanding restrictions on the handling of facilities within Korea, conducting inspections throughout Korea, insisting on threatening our rear, and demanding the maintenance of armed forces on our coastal islands and sea areas. What is particularly unreasonable is that while the other side attempts to interfere with our right to handle facilities within Korea, it also attempts to continue importing military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under the pretext of rotation and replenishment. Our representative emphasized that any suggestion that interferes with our internal affairs is intolerable. Once the military demarcation line is determined, both sides must completely withdraw all their armed forces from the other side's rear, and only on this basis can a reasonable solution to the differences of opinion between the two sides be sought.

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side's representative refused to express a clear attitude towards our side's principle of rapidly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice and attempted to detain a portion of the prisoners of war after the armistice. On the other hand, they insisted on first exchanging prisoner information and inviting the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoner-of-war camps before entering into a discussion of the basic principles of prisoner release, even saying that if our side did not accept their preconditions, they would refuse to discuss the fourth agenda item. Our representative pointed out that the other side's unreasonable attitude is intolerable. In this meeting, neither side has the right to force the other side to accept any of its demands, but can only obtain the other side's agreement to its proposition by reasoning and logic. If they want to conduct serious negotiations, the other side must first abandon this barbaric and unreasonable attitude. Our representative pointed out that prisoner materials must be exchanged, but the principle of both sides releasing all their prisoners must be determined before the exchange. If this principle is not determined, what is the necessity of exchanging the complete list of prisoners of war? The other side used the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War as an excuse and insisted on deciding on the issue of inviting the Red Cross to visit prisoner-of-war camps before discussing the subject of the fourth agenda item. Our representative pointed out that our side's principled proposal is absolutely reasonable. Even the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War clearly stipulates that once actual hostilities cease, the belligerents shall release and repatriate all prisoners of war without delay. The other side, as a signatory to the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, is unwilling to abide by even this basic principle. What qualifications does it have to invoke the Geneva Convention to evade the discussion of this absolutely fair and reasonable principled proposition put forward by our side? Our representative insisted and emphasized that this principle must be discussed and determined first because it is the most reasonable proposition.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 12th: At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks on December 12th, the other side proposed a new plan, proposing that neutral countries form observer groups under the control and command of the armistice committee composed of the belligerent parties, stationed at the rear land, sea, and air import ports and transportation centers agreed upon by both sides, freely travel on the main transportation lines throughout Korea, and conduct regular aerial reconnaissance and photographic flights. In the other side's new plan, the other side still insists on importing military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under the pretext of rotation and replenishment during the armistice, while at the same time advocating prohibiting the restoration, expansion, and construction of airfields and aviation equipment within Korea. Regarding the issue of all armed forces of both sides withdrawing from the other side's coastal islands and sea areas, the other side proposed limiting it to territorial waters and islands within territorial waters, and openly advocated maintaining its armed forces on some islands and sea areas in our rear during the armistice. Our representative pointed out that the other side's so-called new plan still contains unreasonable suggestions and demands that have long been thoroughly refuted by our side. Our side will never tolerate the other side interfering in our internal affairs, interfering in our handling of any facilities within Korea, while at the same time increasing its military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea under the pretext of rotation and replenishment. Our side also cannot consider the other side continuing to maintain its armed forces in our rear during the armistice, directly threatening our rear. As for the monitoring agency composed of neutral countries, in order to effectively supervise that neither side imports military forces, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea during the armistice, it should be an agency parallel to the armistice committee, responsible for conducting necessary inspections at the rear ports agreed upon by both sides and reporting the results of its inspections to the armistice committee, rather than a subsidiary agency under the control and command of the armistice committee composed of the belligerent parties. On the other hand, in order to carry out its clear mission, it should not, and more importantly, has no need to go beyond the scope of conducting inspections at the rear ports. At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side's representative still refused to express a clear attitude towards our side's principle of both sides rapidly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement. Our representative proposed five principles for rapidly resolving the fourth agenda item at the meeting. The full text of the proposal is as follows:

One, Determine the principle that both sides release all prisoners of war currently held.

Two, Agree that within the shortest possible period after the signing of the armistice agreement, both sides will release and repatriate all prisoners of war they hold in batches, and determine the principle that seriously wounded and sick prisoners of war should be released and repatriated in the first batch.

Three, Suggest that the location for the exchange of prisoners of war between the two sides be set at Panmunjom, Kaesong.

Four, Suggest that under the armistice committee, each side send an equal number of personnel to form a prisoner repatriation committee, responsible for handling the handover of prisoners in accordance with the above agreement.

Five, Once the above items are agreed and determined by both sides, exchange the existing list of all prisoners of war of both sides immediately.

　　在十二、十三两天的小组委员会会议上
　　我严斥美方拒绝协商的无理态度
    我方对第四项议程提出五点原则 　【新华社开城十三日电】十三日的朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表严词驳斥对方拒绝协商解决双方意见分歧的无理态度。我方代表指出：我方一贯主张在停战后迅速召开高级政治会议，彻底和平解决朝鲜问题，因此我方原认为停战期间无需在双方后方进行视察，但由于对方畏惧我军力量，坚持后方视察，我方为打开谈判僵局作了重大努力，在十二月三日正式提议邀请中立国家成立监察机构在双方同意的后方口岸进行必要的视察。但对方却拖延了九天之久，在十二月十二日提出了所谓修正方案，仍然坚持干涉我内政，要求限制朝鲜境内的设备的处理，并在朝鲜全境进行视察，坚持威胁我后方，要求在我沿海岛屿与海面保持武装力量。尤其不合理的是对方一方面企图干涉我方处理朝鲜境内设备之权，另一方面却又企图以轮换与补充为藉口，继续自朝鲜境外输入军事力量与武器弹药。我方代表强调指出：任何干涉我方内政的建议是不能容忍的。军事分界线既经确定，双方必须自对方的后方完全撤出其一切武装力量，只有在这个基础上才能求得双方分歧意见的合理解决。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方代表一方面对于我方所提出的停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则拒绝表示明确态度，并企图在停战后扣留一部分战俘，另一方面则坚持必须首先交换俘虏资料，并邀请红十字会国际委员会访问俘虏营，然后才能进入释放俘虏的基本原则的讨论，甚至谓如我方不接受其先决条件，即拒绝讨论第四项议程。我方代表指出对方这种无理态度是不能容忍的。在这一个会里，任何一方都无权强制对方接受其任何要求，而只能凭说理与逻辑取得对方对其主张的同意。如要认真地进行谈判，对方就必须首先抛弃这种横蛮无理的态度。我方代表指出俘虏材料是要交换的，但在交换之前必须确定双方释放其全部俘虏的原则。如这一原则不予确定，有何必要交换全部战俘名单。对方以日内瓦战俘公约为藉口，坚持在讨论第四项议程的主题之前就决定邀请红十字会访问战俘营的问题。我方代表指出我方的原则建议是绝对合理的，即使是日内瓦战俘公约，也明确规定实际的敌对行为一经停止，交战双方即应毫不迟疑地释放与遣回所有战俘。身为日内瓦战俘公约之签字国的对方，连这一个基本原则都不愿遵守，更有何资格援用日内瓦公约来逃避对于我方提出的这一绝对公平合理的原则主张的讨论。我方代表坚持和强调这个原则必须首先讨论，并予以确定，因为这是最合理的主张。
    【新华社开城十二日电】十二月十二日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的小组委员会上，对方提出新方案，提议在交战双方所组成的停战委员会控制与指挥下，设中立国家组成的观察小组，驻在双方同意的后方陆海空进口口岸及交通中心，在朝鲜全境的主要交通线上自由来往，并定期进行空中侦察与摄影飞行。在对方的新方案中，对方仍然坚持在停战期间以轮换与补充为藉口，自朝鲜境外输入军事力量与武器弹药，而同时又主张禁止朝鲜境内的飞机场和航空设备的恢复、扩充与修建。对于双方一切武装力量撤出另一方的沿海岛屿与海面的问题，对方提议仅限于领海与领海之内的岛屿，并公然主张在停战期间，在我方后方的一部分岛屿和海面上保持其武装力量。我方代表指出：对方的所谓新方案中，仍然包含了早为我方所彻底驳斥的无理建议与要求，我方决不能容忍对方干涉我内政，过问我方对朝鲜境内的任何设备的处理，而同时却又以轮换与补充为藉口自朝鲜境外增加其军事力量和武器、弹药。我方亦不能考虑对方在停战期间继续在我后方保持其武装部队直接威胁我方的后方。至于中立国家所组成的监察机构，为了确实监督双方在停战期间不自朝鲜境外输入军事力量和武器弹药，它一方面应该是与停战委员会平行的机构，负责在双方同意的后方口岸进行必要的视察，向停战委员会报告其视察的结果，而不应该是在交战双方所组成的停战委员会的控制与指挥下的附属机构。另一方面为了执行其明确的任务，它不应该更没有必要超出在后方口岸进行视察的范围。第四项议程的小组委员会上，对方代表对于我方所提出的停战协议签字后双方迅速释放与遣送全部战俘的原则，仍然拒绝表示明确的态度。我方代表在会上提出了迅速解决第四项议程的五点原则，建议全文如下：
    一、确定双方释放现在收容的全部战俘的原则。
    二、商定在停战协议签字后最短可能的期间内，双方分批释放及遣送完毕其所收容的全部战俘，并确定重伤、病战俘应先在第一批内释放及遣送的原则。
    三、建议双方交接战俘的地点，定在开城板门店。
    四、建议在停战委员会下，双方各派同等数目人员组成遣俘委员会，遵照上述协议负责处理俘虏的交接事宜。
    五、上述各项一经双方同意确定后，即行交换双方现有全部战俘名单。
