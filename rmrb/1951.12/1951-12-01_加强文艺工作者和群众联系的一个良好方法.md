    A Good Method to Strengthen the Connection Between Literary and Art Workers and the Masses
    Recently, the Beijing Youth Service Department and the Beijing Library have been regularly holding reader symposiums on literary and artistic works to promote the reading of excellent literary and artistic works by the masses and to strengthen the ideological education of patriotism and internationalism.
    The Beijing Youth Service Department has held nine symposiums from April to now, discussing works such as "Flames of the Plains," "Forty Years by the Blower Furnace," and "Daughter Dan." The Beijing Library has held three symposiums from August to now, discussing "Flames of the Plains," "New Children's Heroes," and "Heroes of Lüliang." Readers participating in the symposiums include workers, students, soldiers, and government cadres. The authors and translators of these works are also invited to attend. Participants unanimously believe that this kind of symposium is a good method to carry out ideological education among the masses and strengthen the close connection between writers and the masses. Writers and readers both welcome it. On the reader's side, they can not only talk about the education they have received from the works and directly put forward their opinions on the works to the writers at the meeting, but also directly understand the creation process and creation experience of the works from the writers, helping themselves to understand the works more deeply; on the writer's side, they can directly meet with the readers of their works and listen to the opinions of the masses, so that creation can be improved. This method is to learn the advanced methods created by Soviet libraries and other cultural institutions. The Beijing Youth Service Department and the Beijing Library have adopted this method and have received some good results, which are worthy of emulation and promotion. This method is not only applicable to literary works, but also to dramas and movies. Regularly holding symposiums for writers, playwrights, directors, actors, and readers and audiences to meet and exchange opinions is beneficial to strengthening the connection between literary and art workers and the masses, helping literary and art workers absorb the opinions of the masses, and is one of the effective methods to enable the people's art cause to be continuously improved with the assistance of the masses.

    加强文艺工作者和群众联系的一个良好方法
    北京青年服务部和北京市图书馆近来分别经常召开文艺作品读者座谈会，借以推动群众阅读优秀的文艺作品，加强爱国主义与国际主义的思想教育。
    北京青年服务部从四月起到现在，已经举行了九次座谈会，讨论了“平原烈火”“鼓风炉旁四十年”“丹娘”等作品。北京市图书馆从八月起到现在，召开了三次座谈会，讨论了“平原烈火”“新儿女英雄传”“吕梁英雄传”。参加座谈的读者有工人、学生、战士、机关干部等。这些作品的作者和译者也同时被邀出席。参加者一致认为这种座谈会是对群众进行思想教育和加强作家与群众密切联系的一种良好方法，作家和读者都表示欢迎。在读者方面，不但可以在会上谈一谈自己从作品中获得的教育，和向作家直接提出对该作品的意见，而且可以直接从作家方面了解作品的创作过程和创作经验，帮助自己更深一步地去理解作品；在作家方面，可以直接和他的作品的读者见面，听取群众意见，使创作提高一步。这种办法是学习苏联图书馆和别的文化事业机关所创造的先进方法。北京青年服务部和北京市图书馆采用这种方法，收到了一些好的效果，是值得仿效和提倡的。这种方法不但适用于文学作品，也适用于戏剧和电影。经常召开作家、剧作家、导演、演员和读者、观众见面交换意见的座谈会，对于加强文艺工作者和群众的联系，帮助文艺工作者吸收群众意见，是有益的，是使人民的艺术事业能够经常在群众的协助下不断提高的有效方法之一。
