    To the Editor: After reading the article "Accusation by Korean People's Army Soldier Kim Jun-geun: American Aggressors Slaughter Our Captured Personnel," published in the People's Daily on November 26th, the students of our Normal University unanimously expressed boundless anger and hatred towards the bloody crimes of the American bandits. Comrade Lü Naijun, who represented the All-China Student Federation on the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to extend慰问 (condolences or appreciation) this past April, shared with everyone what he personally witnessed in Korea regarding our army's lenient treatment of American and British prisoners of war, in order to contrast it with the atrocities of the American invading forces. He said: "On the evening of May 3rd this year, we saw about five hundred invading enemy prisoners of war being escorted to the rear. The Volunteer Army comrades responsible for escorting the prisoners treated them very kindly and even gave each prisoner a rice sack filled to the brim, ensuring their material well-being. Later, we also saw the living conditions of the prisoners in the prisoner-of-war camp. They lived free and secure lives and had freedom of religious belief. The prisoners themselves made crosses out of branches, and there were Catholic priests and Christian pastors among them. The Volunteer Army treated the prisoners with such leniency, but the American aggressors used electric fences, gasoline drenching, steam prisons, burning, killing, and other cruel and bloody means to deal with our captured personnel."
    Many students have expressed their determination to respond to the atrocities of the American aggressors with practical actions such as studying diligently, exercising, and helping teachers transform their thinking.    Normal University Correspondence Group

    对待俘虏的一个显明对照
    编辑同志：我们师范大学的同学们读了人民日报十一月二十六日所刊的朝鲜人民军战士金俊根“控诉美国侵略者屠杀我军被俘人员”一文后，一致对美国强盗的血腥罪行表示无限的愤怒和仇恨。今年四月间曾代表中华全国学生联合会参加中国人民赴朝慰问团到朝鲜去的吕乃君同学，把他在朝鲜亲眼看到的我军宽待美英俘虏的情形告诉大家，来与美国侵略军的暴行作一对比。他说：“今年五月三日的晚上，我们在公路上看到了正被押往后方的约五百名侵略军俘虏。负责押送俘虏的志愿军同志十分和善地对待他们，并且还发给俘虏们每人一个装得满满的米袋，使他们在生活上获得了物质的保证。后来我们又在俘虏营里看到了俘虏们的生活情形。他们过着自由而安全的生活，并有宗教信仰的自由。俘虏们自己用树枝做成了十字架，他们中间还有天主教神父与基督教牧师。志愿军对待俘虏是这样的宽大，但美国侵略者却用电网、灌汽油、蒸汽监、烧杀等残忍的血腥手段来对付我军的被俘人员。”
    许多同学都表示要用努力学习、锻炼身体与帮助老师改造思想的实际行动来回答美国侵略者的暴行。    师范大学通讯组
