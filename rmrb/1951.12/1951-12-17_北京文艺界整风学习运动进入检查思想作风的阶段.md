Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: The rectification study movement in Beijing's literary and art circles, after undergoing ideological mobilization and document reading, has now entered the stage of using criticism and self-criticism to examine ideology and work style.

    Since the mobilization meeting for the rectification study on November 24th, various literary and art units in Beijing have launched enthusiastic rectification studies. Some units temporarily suspended or reduced their daily work to concentrate on the rectification study. At the beginning of the study, literary and art workers from various units conscientiously read the study documents designated by the "Beijing Literary and Art Circles Study Committee." The Study Committee also invited Zhou Wen and He Qifang to give lectures to the literary and art workers participating in the rectification study on "On Practice" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," respectively.

    Simultaneous with reading documents, each unit, in light of its own situation, put forward key points for examining ideology and work, and made specific rectification mobilization reports. At the Central Academy of Drama's rectification mobilization meeting, President Ouyang Yuqian and Vice President Zhang Geng reviewed the academy's serious tendency to deviate from politics in its artistic work, blindly worship the West, and improve skills behind closed doors, as well as the bureaucratic work style of the leadership that was detached from the masses. After this mobilization report, the confidence of all teachers and students in transforming their thinking and improving their work greatly increased. The Central Conservatory of Music's Music Work Troupe, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, and other units also had their leaders make self-criticisms first, thereby promoting the rectification study in their units.

    By mid-month, the vast majority of units participating in the rectification study had completed document reading and entered the stage of using criticism and self-criticism methods to examine ideology and work style. In examining ideology and work style, various units used two different methods: one was to start with the individual and examine their stance, viewpoint, literary and artistic thought, and work attitude; the other was to focus on problems in work, and connect them to each individual's ideology and work for examination. In the examination, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government adopted the method of ideological mutual assistance: members of each rectification study group voluntarily formed mutual assistance groups, and each person's problems were first freely discussed in the mutual assistance group, mutually enlightening each other. After carefully exchanging opinions and having a relatively clear understanding, they then reported and discussed it in the group. This method effectively helped each person to deeply reflect on themselves and realize the root cause of their erroneous thinking.

    In the ideological mobilization and document reading stages of the rectification study movement, literary and art workers exposed many incorrect ideas. Some literary and art workers doubted that literature and art must be led by the ideology of the working class; many music workers and art workers held purely technical views that did not ask about politics; some literary and art workers also mistakenly believed that the literature and art of the working class did not require technique, and that technique would be dimmed in the face of politics; some literary and art workers separated popularization and improvement, believing that popularization was a short-term matter, and if they engaged in popularization for a long time, it would be difficult for them to do improvement work in the future; and some literary and art workers blindly worshipped the West, fundamentally doubting the existence of a national classical heritage in literature and art.

    In order to clarify these confused ideas, the "Beijing Literary and Art Circles Study Committee" decided to first conduct serious research, criticism, and examination of these issues themselves. The Study Committee decided to conduct examinations separately according to the five departments of film, drama, literature, fine arts, and music, so that appropriate conclusions could be drawn after the debate was unfolded. In addition, regarding the issue of the rectification of literary and art organizations, the Study Committee also decided to put forward a specific rectification plan in the near future.

    北京文艺界整风学习运动进入检查思想作风的阶段
   【新华社十六日讯】北京文艺界整风学习运动经过了思想动员和阅读文件，现在已进入运用批评和自我批评检查思想、作风的阶段。
    从十一月二十四日整风学习动员大会以后，北京各文艺工作单位就展开了热烈的整风学习。有的单位为了集中力量进行整风学习，暂时停止了或减少了日常业务。各单位的文艺工作者在学习开始时认真阅读了“北京文艺界学习委员会”所指定的各项学习文件。学习委员会并约请周文、何其芳分别向参加整风学习的文艺工作者作了关于“实践论”和“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的讲演。
    和阅读文件同时，各单位针对本身情况提出了思想和工作的检查重点，并作了具体的整风动员报告。在中央戏剧学院的整风动员大会上，院长欧阳予倩和副院长张庚检讨了该院艺术工作上严重脱离政治、盲目崇拜西洋、关门提高技术的错误倾向，和领导上脱离群众的官僚主义作风。经过这一次动员报告，全院师生对改造思想、改进工作的信心大为增加。中央音乐学院音乐工作团、北京市文学艺术工作者联合会等单位都由领导人员首先作了检讨，因而推动了本单位的整风学习。
    到本月中旬，绝大部分参加整风学习的单位，都已经结束了文件阅读，进入运用批评和自我批评方法来检查思想和作风的阶段。各单位在检查思想、作风中，分别用了两种不同的方式：一种是从个人开始，检查立场、观点、文艺思想、工作态度；另一种是以工作中的问题为主，联系各人的思想、工作，进行检查。在检查中，中央人民政府文化部电影局采取了思想互助的办法：每一整风学习小组内的成员，自愿结成互助组，每个人的问题都先在互助组内自由漫谈，互相启发，经过仔细交换意见，有了比较明确的认识后再到小组上去报告和讨论。这种办法，有效地帮助了各人深刻反省自己，认识到自己错误思想的根源。
    在整风学习运动的思想动员、阅读文件两个阶段中，文艺工作者暴露了许多不正确的思想。有的文艺工作者怀疑文艺必须受工人阶级的思想领导；很多音乐工作者和美术工作者抱着不问政治的纯技术观点；也有文艺工作者错误地认为工人阶级的文艺是不要技术的，技术在政治面前将黯然无光；有的文艺工作者把普及和提高截然分开，认为普及是短时期的事，自己如果搞普及的时间长了，将来作提高工作就有困难；还有的文艺工作者盲目崇拜西洋，根本怀疑在文艺上有民族的古典遗产存在。
    为了澄清这些混乱思想，“北京文艺界学习委员会”决定对这些问题自己先进行认真的研究、批判和检查。学习委员会决定按电影、戏剧、文学、美术、音乐五个部门分别进行检查，以便展开争论后作出适当的结论。此外，关于文学艺术团体的整顿问题，学习委员会也决定在最近提出具体的整顿方案。
