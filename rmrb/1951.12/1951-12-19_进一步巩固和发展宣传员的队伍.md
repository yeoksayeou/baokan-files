    Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People's Masses Throughout the Party" on January 1 this year, Chinese Communist Party organizations across the country have devoted great efforts to establishing and developing propaganda worker ranks. Now propaganda workers have seen significant development in many places. According to statistics up to October, there are now more than 1.5 million propaganda workers nationwide. This means that propaganda workers have now become a propaganda force of considerable size nationwide.

    Facts over the past year have proven that establishing propaganda workers is the most important link in strengthening the Party's propaganda work among the people's masses. Wherever propaganda workers have been earnestly established, the face of the Party's mass propaganda work has undergone tremendous changes, with greatly enhanced regularity and organization. The enormous role of propaganda workers in mass propaganda work has been clearly demonstrated in many places. Thanks to the help of propaganda workers, and relying on the propaganda work of propaganda workers, the progress of various practical tasks has become exceptionally smooth and more vibrant, and the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses has become closer. In this regard, the situations in Daming County, Hebei, and Xuchang area, Henan, are two of the most prominent examples. After establishing propaganda workers, the work in these two places completely changed. In these places, many tasks that were previously difficult to carry out are now easier, those that were previously lifeless are now vibrant, and those that previously required great effort to do well can now be done well with little effort. For example, the grain requisition work in Daming County used to require repeated mobilization to complete, but now, with just a call from the government, the peasants deliver the grain in less than a day. Why has the work in these places changed like this? It is because the leaders in these places have attached importance to the work of propaganda workers, regularly used propaganda workers to carry out propaganda, and based all work on the foundation of propaganda work. With propaganda workers constantly carrying out propaganda work, the masses can clearly understand the significance of various tasks in a timely manner, thus greatly enhancing their awareness and enthusiasm in responding to and implementing the government's calls. In this way, the various tasks of the Party and the government naturally become easier to carry out. These facts vividly demonstrate that propaganda workers have become indispensable assistants for the Party and the government in carrying out various tasks, and that using propaganda workers to conduct in-depth and widespread propaganda among the masses is an important condition for ensuring the smooth progress and successful completion of various tasks.

    The Party's propaganda worker work has achieved significant results, which is evident to everyone. However, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, but must continue to improve and strengthen propaganda worker work so that it can better serve the various tasks of the Party and the government. Currently, our people across the country are facing a major political task, which is to implement increased production and thrift, oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, in order to strive for greater victory in the anti-aggression struggle and greater victory in building our great country. To successfully complete this task, the people across the country must be actively mobilized, and the propaganda front must be especially actively mobilized. Only when the propaganda front is fully mobilized first, and propaganda work is further strengthened, penetrating every corner of the country, can the broad masses of the people consciously and actively rise up to fight for the great task of increasing production and practicing thrift. To widely and deeply publicize increasing production and practicing thrift, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy, and to penetrate this propaganda to every place and every person, is the glorious and arduous task that the propaganda front should undertake at present. And in order to undertake and complete this task, it is necessary to further consolidate and strengthen the propaganda ranks, especially to further consolidate and strengthen the propaganda worker ranks.

    At present, the propaganda worker ranks, on the one hand, have seen significant development, but on the other hand, they still partially exhibit formalism. A large proportion of propaganda workers have not yet been consolidated in terms of systems, their work is not carried out regularly, and a small number even play no role at all. In the past, some local Party organizations have paid attention to overcoming this phenomenon. To this end, they have rectified the propaganda worker ranks and have achieved results. In the future, we should continue to carry out this rectification work. The method of rectification is to establish various leadership systems for propaganda workers. In the past, the reason why propaganda workers in many places did not play a role, or could not play a role regularly, was mainly due to the lack of sound leadership systems. Some individual propaganda workers even collapsed after being established due to lack of leadership. Therefore, in the future, Party committees at all levels should attach great importance to the establishment of regular leadership systems for propaganda workers.

    The leadership systems for propaganda workers that are currently effective in various places mainly include the following: (1) Branches hold propaganda worker meetings on time, where propaganda workers report on their work and experience, study and discuss propaganda materials issued by higher Party committees and in newspapers, and formulate future propaganda tasks and methods based on the actual situation of their units. Such propaganda worker meetings are generally held every two weeks, and sometimes they can be held in conjunction with branch meetings. Holding propaganda worker meetings should be the most important method for branch leaders to lead propaganda workers' work, and it should also be an important content of the entire branch work. (2) Party committees at the county, city, and factory levels regularly convene propaganda worker representative meetings or propaganda worker conferences. The content of the meetings should be to exchange experiences in propaganda work, with good propaganda workers making typical reports, and responsible comrades of the Party committee summarizing work experience and reporting on the situation and tasks. Experience in various places has proven that such meetings, if held well, can greatly enhance and encourage propaganda workers. To reduce the difficulty of propaganda workers traveling long distances to attend meetings, such meetings do not need to be held too frequently, generally once every two months. In cities and factories with more convenient conditions, more meetings can be held as needed. (3) Establish propaganda worker transmission stations in rural areas. Many places have already established such transmission stations, but unfortunately, the work of transmission stations is not frequent enough in many places. In the future, the work of transmission stations should be regularized. To this end, a dedicated person (preferably a member or reporter of the district committee or county committee) should be appointed to be responsible for the transmission work of the transmission station, requiring them to regularly come to the station to report on the situation and tasks. The content of the reports should be as popular as possible and closely integrated with the actual situation of the local area. In addition to reporting to propaganda workers, the transmitter should also preside over propaganda workers' discussions on the content of the reports, be responsible for answering various questions raised by propaganda workers, and maintain certain contact with the branches to which the propaganda workers belong, providing them with necessary guidance in their work at any time. When district committees, county committees, or reporters go to the countryside to make reports, they should, as far as possible, conduct on-site inspections of the propaganda effects of propaganda workers, so as to help propaganda workers improve their work. Establishing transmission stations should be an important link for the Party committees of counties and districts to regularly lead the work of propaganda workers. (4) Hold training classes to provide propaganda workers with general training. There are two types of training classes: one is a training class detached from production, organized by the county, with a training time generally of three to five days. This type of training class can be held in places where conditions permit. The other is a part-time training class organized by districts or several villages (or townships), using the propaganda workers' spare time for training. This type of training class is easier to hold widely. The content of the training should include: the basic principles and methods of mass propaganda work, the Party and government's current policies, and common knowledge of domestic and international current events. Policies and production knowledge can vary depending on the propaganda worker's job position. For example, factories can focus on the Trade Union Law, the Labor Insurance Regulations, the democratic reform of industrial and mining enterprises, and methods for improving production. Rural areas can focus on agricultural production policies, common knowledge of agricultural production, and the Marriage Law. In areas where land reform is being carried out, the focus can be on explaining the Land Reform Law. At present, the issue of increasing production and practicing thrift, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy should be universally explained. In addition to lectures by teachers, the training methods should also allow propaganda workers to learn from summarizing their own propaganda work experience. These training classes should be organized by the municipal committee, county committee, and factory Party committee. Members and reporters of the county, city, and factory Party committees can serve as teachers in these training classes. The training of propaganda workers can also be held in conjunction with the training of general Party members and worker-peasant activists. (5) Divide propaganda workers according to their propaganda targets and propaganda tools, and appropriately fix their work positions. Dividing according to propaganda targets means that each propaganda worker is responsible for conducting propaganda among a certain group of people. The advantage of this division of labor is that it is convenient for propaganda workers to understand the ideological trends of the masses and strengthen their connection with the masses. Dividing according to propaganda tools means that propaganda workers are responsible for one or more propaganda tools according to their specialties, such as some are responsible for blackboards, some are responsible for reading groups, some are responsible for radio broadcasting, and some are responsible for loudspeakers. The advantage of this division of labor is that it can enable propaganda workers to act as the backbone of various mass propaganda organizations, so that the work of propaganda workers is directly combined with the propaganda activities of various mass propaganda organizations. The method of dividing according to propaganda targets and dividing according to propaganda tools can be implemented in an overlapping manner, that is, a propaganda worker is responsible for propaganda among a certain group of people and is also responsible for a propaganda tool.

    Experience in various places has proven that as long as the above leadership systems are established, the work of propaganda workers will naturally be greatly strengthened and will gradually tend to be regularized. In this way, the occurrence of formalism can be avoided, and the ranks of propaganda workers can develop along a sound path.

    In addition to continuing to consolidate the existing propaganda worker organizations, the future is to enable the ranks of propaganda workers to achieve greater development. Although we now have more than 1.5 million propaganda workers, firstly, the development of propaganda workers is not yet widespread nationwide. Many places have not yet established propaganda workers, and in places where propaganda workers have been established, the development of propaganda workers is mostly extremely inadequate. Secondly, according to the scale of the Party's mass propaganda work and the tasks it undertakes at present and in the future, the existing number of propaganda workers is small and far from meeting the needs. Our country is a large country with a population of 500 million, so the scale of the Party's mass propaganda work is extremely large. To make our propaganda work regularly penetrate the entire mass of the people, it is impossible without a larger-scale, organized propaganda worker force. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the existing number of propaganda workers, but must continue to devote great efforts to further developing propaganda workers. We now have more than 5.8 million Party members, 5.5 million Youth League members, and a large number of revolutionary activists among the masses. Based on these conditions, it is entirely possible to gradually achieve greater development of the propaganda worker ranks nationwide. By the end of next year, we should strive to establish propaganda workers in all places where there are Party branches (except for places where the branches are particularly poor), initially reaching the goal of 4 million to 5 million propaganda workers, and then continue to develop steadily on this basis.

    To enable the ranks of propaganda workers to achieve greater development and gradually reach higher goals is a major task of the Party's construction work, and Party organizations in various places should make earnest efforts to complete this task. Party committees at all levels should immediately formulate plans to develop propaganda workers by the end of next year in accordance with the actual situation, and deploy this plan to the Party's grassroots organizations. In the process of implementing the plan, Party committees at all levels should provide regular leadership to this work. Past experience has proven that the importance and leadership of Party committees at all levels to the work of propaganda workers is the key to enabling propaganda workers to achieve rapid development. As long as Party committees at all levels attach importance to and lead the work of propaganda workers, the further development of propaganda workers is fully guaranteed. In the newly liberated areas where land reform has not yet been completed, the focus can be on developing and strengthening various mass propaganda organizations, but in places where the leadership of the Party's district committees is strong, some propaganda worker organizations can be established by the Youth League branches under the leadership of the district committees, and propaganda work can be carried out under the leadership of the district committees and Youth League branches. In areas where land reform has been completed, the ranks of propaganda workers should be gradually established with the establishment and development of the Party and Youth League organizations.

    In developing propaganda workers, on the one hand, we must avoid the hasty phenomenon of absorbing propaganda workers without following the conditions and procedures stipulated in the Central Committee's decision, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to preventing and overcoming conservatism and closed-doorism, which are afraid of developing on a small scale. In the past, some places lowered the conditions for propaganda workers too much, and even transferred all members of mass propaganda organizations into propaganda workers; some places did not pay attention to the political conditions of propaganda workers, but only paid attention to the level of education, so that they absorbed some people with poor qualities or even politically very bad people to become propaganda workers; some places used the method of election by the masses to develop propaganda workers. On the other hand, in the past, some places raised the conditions for propaganda workers too high, so that although there were many Party members, Youth League members, and mass activists, propaganda workers were still established very little; some places did not dare to absorb non-Party revolutionary activists and poor intellectuals to become propaganda workers; some places did not announce the list of propaganda workers to the masses, so that the activities of propaganda workers were in a secret state. All these phenomena are wrong, violate the provisions of the Central Committee's decision, and hinder the normal development of propaganda organizations, and should be thoroughly corrected.

    The work of establishing and developing propaganda workers should be closely combined with the local central work and mass movements. In the past, many places carried out the work of establishing and developing propaganda workers in combination with mass movements such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and production competitions. In the future, we should continue to do so, especially to develop propaganda workers in combination with the movement to increase production and practice thrift. The advantages of establishing and developing propaganda workers in combination with central work are: this can make the work of establishing and developing propaganda workers directly serve the current central work, and it is also convenient to discover and cultivate activists in propaganda work and absorb them as propaganda workers. The specific method of establishing and developing propaganda worker organizations in combination with central work is: when Party committees at all levels deploy central work to the lower levels, they should also deploy the propaganda work on these central works, as well as the task of establishing and developing propaganda worker organizations in these propaganda works. When inspecting and summarizing these central works, we should focus on inspecting and summarizing propaganda work, and combine this inspection work to establish propaganda worker organizations. Any central work is inseparable from propaganda work, and requires large-scale mass propaganda work to serve it, and these large-scale mass propaganda works are the best conditions for establishing and developing propaganda workers. Experience in various places has proven that in places where this method is adopted to establish propaganda workers, the development of propaganda workers is faster, and the quality of the propaganda workers established is also better; and in places that do not know how to adopt this method, the development of propaganda workers is slower. The reason why the Party organizations in many places often mistakenly believe that the work of establishing and developing propaganda workers is an "extra burden" and a work that contradicts the central work is mainly because they do not know how to combine the work of establishing and developing propaganda workers with the central work and other practical work. Therefore, Party organizations in various places must pay attention to adopting this method to establish and develop propaganda workers in the future. Only in this way can the ranks of propaganda workers achieve rapid and smooth development.

    进一步巩固和发展宣传员的队伍
    自从中共中央于今年一月一日发布“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”以来，全国各地中国共产党的组织都用了很大的力量去建立和发展宣传员的队伍。现在宣传员在很多地方已有了较大的发展，截至十月间为止的统计，全国已共有一百五十多万宣传员。这就是说，宣传员现在已在全国范围内成为一支数量相当庞大的宣传队伍。
    将近一年来的事实证明，建立宣传员，是加强党对人民群众的宣传工作的最重要的一环。凡是已认真地建立起宣传员的地方，党的群众宣传工作的面貌都已有了极大的改变，其经常性和组织性都大大加强了。宣传员在群众宣传工作中的巨大作用，已在很多地方明显地表现出来。很多地方由于有了宣传员的帮助，由于依靠了宣传员的宣传工作，各种实际工作的进行都变得格外顺利，变得更加有生气了，党和政府与群众之间的关系也变得更加密切了。在这方面，河北大名县和河南许昌地区的情形，就是两个最突出的例子，这两个地方，在建立了宣传员后，工作完全变了一个样子。在这些地方，有许多工作，原来不好进行的，现在好进行了，原来没有生气的，现在有生气了，原来要费很大力气还做不好的，现在花很少的力量就可以做得很好了。例如大名县的征粮工作，原来是需要三番五次的动员才能全部完成的，现在只要政府一声号召，农民不到一天的时间就把粮食送齐了。这些地方的工作为什么能有这种改变呢？就是因为这些地方的领导者重视了宣传员工作，经常地运用宣传员进行宣传，把一切工作都建立在宣传工作的基础上的缘故。由于有宣传员经常地在进行宣传工作，群众对各种工作的意义都能及时地认识清楚，因而大大地提高了他们响应和实行政府号召的自觉性和热情，这样，党和政府的各项工作自然就容易进行了。这些事实，生动地证明了宣传员已成为党和政府进行各项工作的不可缺少的助手，证明了运用宣传员对群众进行深入而普遍的宣传，就是保证各项工作能够顺利进行和圆满完成的重要条件。
    党的宣传员工作已取得重大成绩，这点已为大家所看到了。但是我们绝不能满足于现有的成绩，而必须继续改进和加强宣传员工作，使它为党和政府的各项工作更好地服务。目前我们全国人民正面临着一个重大的政治任务，这个任务就是实行增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义，以便争取反侵略斗争的更大胜利，争取建设我们伟大国家的更大胜利。为了胜利地完成这一任务，全国人民必须积极动员起来，而宣传战线尤其要积极动员起来。只有宣传战线首先充分动员起来，进一步加强了宣传工作，把宣传工作深入到全国每一角落中去，然后才能使广大人民自觉地积极地起来，为增产节约的伟大任务而奋斗。广泛而深入地宣传增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义，把这一宣传深入到每处每人，这就是目前宣传战线所应担负起来的一个光荣而艰巨的任务。而为了担负和完成这一任务，就必须进一步巩固和加强宣传队伍，特别是要进一步巩固和加强宣传员的队伍。
    目前宣传员的队伍，一方面是已有较大的发展，但另一方面也还部分地存在着形式主义的现象，有很大一部分宣传员尚未从制度上巩固起来，他们的工作进行得很不经常，有很少数甚至根本不起作用。过去有些地方的党的组织已经注意了克服这种现象，为此，他们曾对宣传员的队伍进行了整顿，并已收到了成效。今后我们应继续进行这种整顿工作。整顿的方法，就是要建立起对宣传员的各种领导制度。过去有许多地方的宣传员所以不起作用，或者不能经常起作用，其主要原因就是缺少健全的领导制度。有个别地方的宣传员甚至因为缺少领导，在建立起来以后无形中又垮台了。所以今后各级党委应该十分重视对宣传员的经常领导制度的建立。
    现在各地行之有效的对宣传员的领导制度主要有这样一些：（一）支部按时召开宣传员会议，由宣传员在会上汇报工作情况和经验，学习和讨论上级党委发下的及报纸上的宣传材料，并根据本单位实际情况规定出以后的宣传任务和办法。这样的宣传员会议，一般以每两星期召开一次为宜，有时也可和支部会议合并举行。召开宣传员会议，应该是支部领导宣传员工作的最重要的一项办法，也应该是整个支部工作的一项重要内容。（二）由县和市及工厂的党的委员会定期召开宣传员代表会议或宣传员大会。会议的内容应该是交流宣传工作经验，由好的宣传员作典型报告，并由党委负责同志作工作经验总结及关于形势与任务的报告。各地经验证明，这样的会如开得好，对于提高和鼓励宣传员有很大作用。为减少宣传员远程赴会的困难，这样的会议可不必过多召开，一般每两个月召开一次即可。在条件较方便的城市和工厂中，可视需要多召开一些。（三）在农村中建立宣传员传授站。现在很多地方已经建立了这样的传授站，但可惜传授站的工作在许多地方还不够经常。今后应使传授站的工作经常化。为此应该指定专人（最好是区委和县委的委员或报告员）担任传授站的传授工作，要他们按时到站作关于形势与任务的报告，报告的内容应该力求通俗，并应密切结合当地的实际情况。传授者除了向宣传员作报告外，并应主持宣传员关于报告内容的讨论，负责解答宣传员提出的各种问题，平时还应与宣传员所属的支部保持一定的联系，随时给他们的工作以必要的指导。区委、县委或报告员下乡做报告时，应尽可能对宣传员的宣传效果加以实地考察，以便据以帮助宣传员改进工作。建立传授站，应该是县和区的党委员会经常领导宣传员工作的一个重要环节。（四）举办训练班，将宣传员加以普遍的训练。训练班有两种，一种是以县为单位举办的脱离生产的训练班，训练时间一般以三、五天为宜。这种训练班，可在有举办条件的地方举办。另一种是以区或几个村（或乡）为单位举办的业余训练班，利用宣传员的业余时间进行训练。这种训练班较易普遍举办。训练的内容应该包括：群众宣传工作的基本原则和方法，党和政府当前的各种政策，国内外时事常识等。政策和生产知识方面，可以因宣传员工作岗位的不同而有所不同，例如工厂可着重工会法、劳动保险条例、工矿企业民主改革及关于改进生产的办法等，农村可着重农业生产政策、农业生产常识及婚姻法等，在进行土地改革的地方，可着重讲解土地改革法。在目前则应普遍讲解增产节约、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义问题。训练的方式，除了由教员讲授外，并应让宣传员从总结他们自己的宣传工作经验中学习。这些训练班以由市委、县委和工厂党委主办为宜，县、市及工厂的党委委员及报告员都可充当这些训练班的教员。对宣传员的训练，也可和对一般党员及工人、农民积极分子的训练合并举行。（五）使宣传员按照宣传对象和宣传工具分工，适当地固定他们的工作阵地。按照宣传对象分工，就是要使每一个宣传员负责对一定的群众进行宣传。这样分工的好处是便于宣传员了解群众的思想动态，加强自己同群众的联系。按照宣传工具分工，就是要使宣传员按照自己的特长负责一种或一种以上的宣传工具，如有的负责黑板报，有的负责读报组，有的负责广播收音工作，有的负责喇叭筒等。这样分工的好处是可以使宣传员充当各种群众宣传组织的骨干，从而使宣传员的工作与各种群众宣传组织的宣传活动直接结合起来。按宣传对象分工和按宣传工具分工的办法可以交叉实行，即一个宣传员既担任对一定的群众的宣传，同时又负责一种宣传工具。
    各地的经验证明，只要建立了上面这些领导制度，宣传员工作自然就会大大加强起来，并逐渐趋于经常化。这样，就可避免形式主义现象的发生，使宣传员的队伍沿着一条健全的道路发展。
    除了要继续巩固现有的宣传员组织以外，今后就是要使宣传员的队伍获得更大的发展。现在我们虽然已有了一百五十多万宣传员，但是第一，宣传员目前在全国的发展还是不普遍的，有很多地方至今仍未建立宣传员，而在已经建立起宣传员的地方，宣传员的发展也多是极不充分的。第二，按照党的群众宣传工作的规模和它在目前及将来所担负的任务来说，宣传员现有的数目还是少的，还是远不能满足需要的。我国是一个有五万万人口的大国，因而党的群众宣传工作的规模是异常庞大的，要使我们的宣传工作经常地深入到全体人民群众中去，没有一个更大规模的有组织的宣传员队伍，是办不到的。因此，我们决不能满足于现有的宣传员的数目，而必须继续用很大的力量去进一步发展宣传员。我们现在有五百八十多万党员，有五百五十万青年团员，此外还有广大的群众革命积极分子，根据这些条件，逐步地使宣传员的队伍在全国获得更大的发展，是完全可能的。在明年年底前，应该争取在所有有党的支部的地方建立起宣传员（支部特别差的地方可除外），初步达到四百万到五百万宣传员的目标，然后再在这一基础上继续稳步发展。
    使宣传员的队伍获得更大的发展，使它逐步达到更高的目标，这是党的建设工作的一项重大的任务，各地党的组织都应为完成这一任务而进行认真的努力。各级党委应即按照实际情况制订出在明年年底以前发展宣传员的计划来，并把这一计划深入布置到党的基层组织中去。而在计划的执行过程中，各级党委应对这一工作予以经常的领导。过去的经验证明，各级党委对宣传员工作的重视和领导，是使宣传员获得迅速发展的关键。只要各级党委对宣传员工作予以重视和领导，宣传员的进一步发展是完全有保障的。在尚未完成土地改革的新解放区，可着重发展和加强各种群众宣传组织，但在党的区委员会领导较强的地方，可在区委领导下，由团支部建立一部分宣传员组织，在区委和团支部的领导下进行宣传工作。在已经完成土地改革的地区，就应随着党和青年团的组织的建立和发展，逐步地把宣传员的队伍建立起来。
    在发展宣传员中，一方面要避免不按中央决定所规定的条件和手续吸收宣传员的草率现象，另一方面也要注意防止和克服小手小脚不敢发展的保守主义及关门主义现象。过去有些地方把宣传员条件降得太低，甚至把群众宣传组织的成员全部转为宣传员；有的地方不注意宣传员的政治条件，只注意文化水平，以至吸收了一些品质不好的甚至政治上很坏的人当宣传员；有的地方用由群众选举的方式去发展宣传员。另一方面，过去也有一些地方把宣传员的条件提得过高，以至党、团员和群众积极分子虽然都很多，但宣传员仍然建立得很少；有的地方不敢吸收非党的革命积极分子和贫苦知识分子当宣传员；有的地方不将宣传员名单向群众宣布，以至使宣传员的活动处于秘密状态。所有这些现象都是不对的，都是违反中央决定的规定的，都是妨碍宣传组织的正常发展的，应该彻底纠正。
    建立和发展宣传员的工作，应该密切地结合着当地各项中心工作和群众运动去进行。过去许多地方建立和发展宣传员的工作，就是结合了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革、生产竞赛等群众运动进行的。今后应继续这样做，特别是要结合着增产节约运动去发展宣传员。结合中心工作去建立和发展宣传员的好处是：这样既可使建立和发展宣传员的工作直接服务于当前的中心工作，又便于发现和培养宣传工作中的积极分子，吸收他们为宣传员。结合中心工作建立和发展宣传员组织的具体办法是：各级党委在向下面布置中心工作时，同时应布置关于这些中心工作的宣传工作，及在这些宣传工作中建立和发展宣传员组织的任务。在检查和总结这些中心工作时，应着重检查和总结宣传工作，并结合这一检查工作，把宣传员组织建立起来。任何中心工作都是离不开宣传工作的，都是需要大规模的群众宣传工作为其服务的，而这些大规模的群众宣传工作，就是建立和发展宣传员的最好条件。各地的经验证明，凡是采取这样的办法去建立宣传员的地方，宣传员的发展就快些，建立起来的宣传员的质量也比较好些；而不懂得采取这种办法的地方，宣传员的发展就慢些。许多地方的党的组织之所以常常错误地认为建立和发展宣传员的工作是一项“额外负担”，是与中心工作相矛盾的一种工作，主要就是由于不懂得把建立和发展宣传员的工作与中心工作及其他实际工作互相结合起来的缘故。所以今后各地党的组织一定要注意采用这样的办法去建立和发展宣传员。只有这样，宣传员的队伍才能获得迅速的和顺利的发展。
