    Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, issued the following written statement in Beijing on December 23 upon receiving the "Promoting Peace Among Nations" Stalin International Peace Prize:
    The "Promoting Peace Among Nations" Stalin International Prize, established to commemorate the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin, is the highest international honor today. Among the six recipients in the second annual awards for 1951, I am one, and I naturally feel extremely honored. Because of this overwhelming honor, I genuinely feel some trepidation in accepting it. Based on my individual work performance, I am not worthy of such a high honor. Please allow me to understand it this way: this is not being given to me personally, but to all the Chinese people who, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, are striving to "strengthen international peace." The victory of our Chinese people's revolution, the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, and the victories in various construction endeavors have contributed to the cause of "strengthening international peace." I am merely acting as a representative, accepting this highest honor on behalf of the Chinese people, an honor that should belong to the entire nation. This is a great encouragement to all of us Chinese people, and especially an encouragement to me personally that is beyond measure. Encouraged, we Chinese people must work even harder to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, increase production and practice economy, and strengthen our resistance to America and aid to Korea, which is the most effective action we can take today to "strengthen international peace." I, in particular, must redouble my efforts so that my work can have more practical results in all aspects.
    The other five winners this time—Mr. Nenni of Italy, Professor Ikuo Oyama of Japan, Mrs. Felton of Britain, Ms. Seghers of Germany, and Mr. Amado of Brazil—have all made excellent contributions to the cause of defending peace, whether through outstanding activities or excellent works. They are all very appropriate choices, and I extend my sincere congratulations to them and express my highest respect to the people they represent.
    The greatest contribution to the cause of "strengthening international peace" has been made by the great Soviet people. Under the direct leadership of Marshal Stalin, the greatest teacher of the working people of the world and the greatest leader in defending the cause of world peace, the Soviet people are implementing an unwavering policy of peace and displaying an unparalleled spirit of creativity, making the Soviet Union the strongest fortress of world peace and the brightest lighthouse of world culture. All good people around the world have gained and increased their confidence in the inevitable victory of peace because of the existence of the Soviet Union, and they are all grateful to the Soviet people and are learning from them. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet people are even more qualified to receive this highest honor prize bearing the great name of Stalin. I hope that from the third awards onward, more Soviet friends will be recommended. I believe this is not only my hope but also the hope of all the Chinese people, and the common hope of all peace-loving people around the world.
    With heartfelt enthusiasm, I wish the forces of peace victory over war. May the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people develop eternally, and may Marshal Stalin live a long life!

    为荣获斯大林国际和平奖金
    郭沫若在京发表书面谈话
     【新华社二十三日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席、中国科学院院长郭沫若为荣获“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金，于二十三日在北京发表书面谈话如下：
    为纪念斯大林大元帅七十寿辰而设置的“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金，是今天国际上最高的荣誉奖金。在第二届一九五一年度的六人获奖者中有我，在我当然是光荣绝顶的事了。因为过分的光荣，使我接受起来认真感觉着有些惶恐。论我个人的工作表现，是不足以膺受这样最高荣誉的。请允许我作这样的了解：这并不是给予我个人，而是给予我们在英明领袖毛主席领导之下为“加强国际和平”而奋斗的全中国人民。我们全中国人民的人民革命的胜利、抗美援朝的胜利以及各方面建设事业的胜利，对于“加强国际和平”的事业是有着贡献的，我只是作为一个代理者，代替中国人民接受了这一次应该属于全国人民的最高荣誉。这对于我们全中国人民是很大的鼓励，而对于我个人尤其是大到无以复加的鼓励。我们中国人民得到鼓励，更要努力遵循着毛主席的指示，增产节约，加强抗美援朝，这正是我们今天“加强国际和平”的最有效的行动。我个人尤其要加倍努力，使得自己的工作在各方面能有更实际的成效。
    这次得奖者的其他五位：意大利的南尼先生、日本的大山郁夫教授、英国的费尔顿夫人、德国的西格斯女士、巴西的亚马多先生，他们或以卓越的活动，或以优秀的作品，对于保卫和平事业都有了很好的贡献，他们都是很适当的当选者，我向他们表示诚恳的庆贺，并对他们所代表的人民力量表示崇高的敬意。
    对于“加强国际和平”事业最有贡献的是伟大的苏联人民。苏联人民在全世界劳动人民最伟大的导师、保卫世界和平事业最伟大的领导者斯大林大元帅的直接领导之下，贯彻着坚定不移的和平政策，发挥着卓越无比的创造精神，使苏联成为了世界和平最坚强的堡垒、世界文化最明亮的灯塔。全世界善良的人们都因有苏联的存在而获得了并增加了和平必胜的信心，都在感谢苏联人民，而向着苏联人民学习。苏联人民的优秀儿女才更有资格获得这有伟大的斯大林名号的最高荣誉奖金。我希望自第三届以后，要多推荐苏联朋友。我相信这不仅是我一个人的希望，而是我们全中国人民的希望，全世界爱好和平的人民共同的希望。
    我怀着满腔的热诚，祝和平力量战胜战争。祝中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊永恒发展，祝斯大林大元帅万寿无疆。
