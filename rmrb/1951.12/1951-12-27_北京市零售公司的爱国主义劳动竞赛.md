    Patriotic Labor Competition in Beijing Retail Company
      Wang Jing
    Since the state-owned Beijing Retail Company implemented democratic management and launched a patriotic labor competition in September, the entire company has taken on a new look. In September and October, the company made a net profit of 2.6 billion yuan and saved more than 2.6 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs. The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the China Store Employees' Union jointly called on trade departments across the country to learn from their experience.
    Before September, the administrative leaders of the state-owned Beijing Retail Company did not have a clear understanding of relying on workers, only emphasizing the "manager responsibility system," believing that "democratic management" was a matter for factories and should not be implemented in trade enterprises. Therefore, everything was decided unilaterally by the administration. Employees did not establish a sense of ownership, and many employees had a strong "official-run business" style in management and lacked enthusiastic service to customers. As a result, the company's tasks could not be completed. From January to August of this year, on average, only about 70% of the sales target was completed each month. After the establishment of the Retail Company's trade union at the end of July this year, although the labor attitude of employees had changed somewhat under patriotic education, the old administrative management system remained, and the red flag competition movement called for by the trade union in August also yielded no results.
    At the end of August this year, administrative and trade union cadres realized that in order to manage business well, a patriotic labor competition must be launched. Therefore, the company's Patriotic Labor Competition Management Committee was established. (The committee includes the manager, trade union chairman, heads of various departments, and employee representatives, etc.) The establishment of this democratic body changed employees' understanding of the company. They said, "Worker representatives are also participating in discussions on company matters." The specific work of the Competition Management Committee is to discuss and decide all issues in the competition movement. Resolutions passed by the Competition Management Committee are handled by the administration if they concern business, finance, planning, and personnel; if they concern employee mobilization, education, and welfare, they are handled by the trade union. In this way, unified arrangements, division of responsibilities, and coordination between the administration and the trade union were achieved.
    The Competition Management Committee put forward the competition slogan of "expanding sales and reducing commodity circulation costs," and the administration and the trade union signed a collective contract. The content of the contract was repeatedly discussed by all employees. Some said, "In the past, the administration did not guarantee the quality of goods, could not supply the needs of the stores in time, and could not repair transportation tools and processing machines immediately when they broke down. These must be stipulated in the contract and guaranteed by the administration." Some said, "Our work attitude was also too bad in the past! We must ensure that we not only abide by the rules, but also use our brains to find ways to improve business." Therefore, all employees identified the problems that had hindered business in the past, studied solutions, and included them in the collective contract. The contract stipulated reward measures: including material rewards, honorary awards, group awards, and individual awards. The source of the bonuses was 5% of the total wages of all employees, proposed by the administration, and increased progressively when the task was overfulfilled, up to a maximum of 15% of the total wages of all employees. In the discussion and signing of the collective contract, the workers' sense of being masters of their own affairs was inspired.
    Various departments of the company also signed contact contracts and supply and sales contracts with various brother companies. In the past, there was a lack of contact and cooperation between departments. For example, the business office and the grain processing plant were not coordinated in production and sales. The processing plant needed raw materials, but the business office did not supply them; the business office needed finished products, but the processing plant did not have them. The same was true for the business section and the truck team: the business section did not hand over the delivery slips to the truck team on time, and the truck team did not follow the prescribed time for loading and unloading. As a result, retail stores often experienced shortages of goods. Now, the signing of contact contracts and supply and sales contracts has enabled every link in the company to be closely connected. On this basis, the entire company was mobilized: all departments revised their patriotic pledges, formulated personal work plans, and various groups and departments challenged each other, making the entire competition movement unfold enthusiastically.
    In the competition, all employees fully demonstrated their enthusiasm and creativity. They tried their best to expand sales and reduce commodity circulation costs. Some employees took the initiative to visit citizens' homes and held discussions with the canteens of institutions to expand the sales of goods as much as possible. Some took the initiative to deliver goods to customers; customers said with satisfaction, "The cadres of the retail company have changed!" Tang Jiaoxuan, a female worker at the No. 16 retail store, drove a cart herself to deliver grain to the western suburbs. On her way back, she promoted sales and contacted customers. All employees paid attention to saving, paid attention to the storage of goods, and worked diligently to turn over, dry, prevent mold, and prevent rats.
    Statistics at the end of October showed that in the two months of the competition movement, goods worth more than 52.2 billion yuan were sold, completing 176% of the original plan, with a net profit of more than 2.6 billion yuan. Commodity circulation costs were reduced by more than 2.6 billion yuan in two months; and capital turnover was accelerated: from once every forty days to once every nineteen days, reducing the backlog of funds by more than 980 billion yuan in two months.

    北京市零售公司的爱国主义劳动竞赛
      王敬
    国营北京市零售公司，自从九月份实行了民主管理，开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛后，整个公司面貌一新。九、十月份两个月里，公司获纯利二十六亿元，节省商品流转费二十六亿多元。中央人民政府贸易部和中国店员工会联合号召全国各地贸易部门学习他们的经验。
    在九月份以前，国营北京市零售公司行政领导干部对依靠工人的思想不明确，只强调“经理负责制”，认为“民主管理”是工厂的事，在贸易企业里不应实行民主管理。因而凡事都是行政上独断独行。职工没有树立主人翁感觉，很多职工在经营上“官办买卖”的作风很浓，对顾客缺乏热情招待。因而使公司的任务不能完成。今年一月到八月，每月平均只完成推销任务的百分之七十左右。今年七月底，零售公司工会成立后，虽然职工在爱国主义教育下劳动态度有所改变，但因行政管理还是老一套，八月份工会号召展开红旗竞赛运动也没有结果。
    今年八月底，行政方面和工会干部认识到要把业务经营好，必须开展爱国主义劳动竞赛。于是，成立了公司的爱国主义劳动竞赛管理委员会。（委员有经理、工会主席、各科科长和职工代表等。）这个民主机构的成立，改变了职工对公司的认识，他们说：“公司大事，也有咱工人代表参加商量了。”竞赛管理委员会的具体工作，就是讨论和决定竞赛运动中的一切问题。竞赛管理委员会通过的决议，属于业务、财政、计划、人事等问题，由行政方面办；属于职工的动员、教育、福利等问题，由工会办。这样，统一布置，分工负责，行政方面和工会的步调统一起来了。
    竞赛管理委员会提出了“扩大卖钱额、减少商品流转费”的竞赛口号，行政方面和工会签订集体合同。合同的内容，经过全体职工反复讨论。有的说：“从前行政不保证商品的质量、不能及时供应门市的需要，运输工具和加工机器坏了，也不能马上给修好。这些都要订在合同上，叫行政方面保证。”有的说：“从前咱们的工作态度也太坏啦！咱们一定保证：不但遵守制度，也要开动脑筋，想法儿把营业搞好。”于是，全体职工把过去搞不好营业的毛病都找了出来，研究出解决的办法，订到集体合同里面。合同里制订了奖励办法：包括物质奖、荣誉奖、团体奖和个人奖。奖金来源，是由行政上按全体职工工资总额提出百分之五，超额完成任务时实行逐级累进，最多增到全体职工工资总额的百分之十五为止。在讨论和签订集体合同中间，启发了工人当家作主的思想。
    公司各部门之间也订立了联系合同，并和各兄弟公司之间订了供销合同。从前，各部门之间缺乏联系和配合。比如：营业处和粮食加工厂，从前产销不协调，加工厂要原料，营业处不供给；营业处要成品，加工厂没有。业务股和大车组也是这样：业务股到时间不把提货单交给大车组，大车组在装运上也不按照规定时间，这样，零售店时常发生缺货的现象。现在，联系合同和供销合同的订立，使公司每个环节都能紧密衔接。在这个基础上，全公司都动了起来：各部门都修订了爱国公约，订立了个人工作计划，各小组、各部门互相挑战应战，使整个竞赛运动火热地展开。
    全体职工在竞赛中，充分地发挥了他们的积极性和创造性。他们想尽方法扩大卖钱额和减少商品流转费。有的职工主动到市民家进行访问，和机关伙食团座谈，尽量扩大商品销路。有的主动给顾客送货；顾客们满意地说：“零售公司的干部可变了样儿了。”十六零售店女工唐教宣，自己赶着大车到西郊送粮食，回来时一边宣传，一边联络主顾。全体职工都注意节约，注意了商品的保管，作到勤倒、勤晒、防霉、防鼠。
    十月底统计，九、十两个月在竞赛运动中共卖出商品值五百二十二亿多元，完成了原计划的百分之一百七十六，得纯利二十六亿多元。两个月降低商品流转费二十六亿多元；并且加速了资金流转：从四十天周转一次缩短为十九天周转一次，两个月少积压资金九千八百多亿元。
