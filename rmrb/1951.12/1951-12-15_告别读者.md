    Farewell to Readers
    It has been half a year since we began this series of talks in early June and met with our readers. Now that the talks are finished, we must put down our pens. We have a few words to say to our readers and some feelings we want to share on this occasion.
    Since the People's Daily editorial on June 6th called for "Correctly using the motherland's language and striving for the purity and health of the language!" the issue of language has received widespread attention and a learning movement has unfolded among the broad masses. When we were initially invited by the People's Daily to write "Talks on Grammar and Rhetoric," we did not expect that readers would pay so much attention to it, far exceeding its intrinsic value. We have also heard people say: In the early days of our people's national construction, there are so many pressing tasks that require our constant and unremitting efforts. Imperialism and reactionaries have not yet been eliminated, and the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries are in full swing. Where is there time to "nitpick over words"? Yes, if it were merely "nitpicking over words," it would indeed be unnecessary. The fact that this issue has received such attention precisely shows that everyone has a correct understanding of the nature of language and a correct understanding of the truth revealed by Stalin: Language is a tool for exchanging thoughts. "Without the exchange of ideas, it is impossible for people to coordinate their common activities in the struggle against the forces of nature and in the production of necessary material wealth... In this sense, language is both a tool of communication and a tool of social struggle and development." Because of this understanding, readers are willing to patiently read these sometimes inevitably dry talks. It is also because of this understanding that we dared to write these talks, even though we were not up to the task, and occupy so much space in the People's Daily. To be honest, writing nearly 200,000 words of talks in half a year was quite exhausting (especially because we also had teaching work), but we finally persevered, also because of this understanding.
    The help readers have given us is immeasurable. In the past half year, we have received about 300 letters from readers. We have tried to reply to all the letters we received, except for those that did not require a reply. There were also a few that were put aside because we were too busy with other work at the time, and after a long time, we felt they were no longer timely, so we did not reply. We apologize for this. Some letters discussed grammatical systems and theoretical issues with us, and we gained a lot of inspiration from them. Unfortunately, these talks focused on practical aspects, which limited us from fully developing the discussion in this area. Some letters pointed out our mistakes and provided suggestions on style, from which we benefited the most. For example, in the eighth paragraph of the fifth talk, "Incompatible with Facts," we quoted a sentence: "In the Jiangnan area, due to excessive rainfall, attention should be paid to drainage work. After the rain, farmers should be mobilized to weed, in order to maintain soil moisture and make the soil loose and dry," and added a comment saying: Grass can maintain moisture, so how can weeding maintain moisture? Later, within ten days, we received letters from three readers explaining that weeding after rain, loosening the topsoil, does have the effect of maintaining underground moisture. (However, the original text did not specify "topsoil" but generally said "soil quality," and it mentioned "drainage" above and then maintaining moisture below, which was really a bit unclear, so in the separate edition, we moved it to the "Incomprehensible" section.) Another example is a sentence quoted in the first paragraph of the second talk, which contained the name of a vulgar American film. Two sentences in the exercises attached to the second talk's separate edition were: "American fruit merchants must lower the price of American fruit and do more advertising to break into the Chinese fruit market"; "Therefore, it is advocated that there is no need to go through fierce struggles with landlords, nor to overemphasize class struggle, believing that peaceful land reform is possible." Readers pointed these out in their letters. When we extracted example sentences from publications, we were also concerned about the danger of taking things out of context and interpreting them arbitrarily, but we were not vigilant enough, resulting in this type of example sentence slipping through. However, the readers' letters arrived too late, so we can only apologize here and correct them in the collected edition in the future. Several readers also wrote to say that the explanations were too brief and that the coordination with the example sentences was not obvious. This was something we had thought of long ago. We originally planned to emphasize the relevant words in each example sentence, but later we had to omit them because they took up too much space in the newspaper, which was indeed a bit inconvenient for readers. We have re-added them when printing the separate editions.
    The most numerous letters were those asking for answers to questions. Some were related to the content of these talks, such as the difference between "的," "底," and "地." There were twenty or thirty people who asked about this question. The third paragraph of the third talk discussed these three characters, but the examples were not sufficient. Let us take this opportunity to answer in general: "Please refer to the Chinese translation of 'The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course,'" which contains numerous examples differentiating these three characters. There were also some letters that were not directly related to the content of the talks: some asked whether a certain character was a misspelled word, some asked whether a certain sentence was incomprehensible, and some sent articles for revision. We think that local language publications and educational publications can set up a "Questions and Answers" column to take on this task (in fact, some publications are already doing so). At the same time, if there were a dictionary suitable for the requirements of the times, it could also solve many problems and avoid the need to write letters to ask people. This is really a very urgent need at present.
    The problems we have discussed in these talks are not few, but it is still not a comprehensive work. It has a specific target audience—general working cadres. This limits its content. It focuses on practical writing and takes few examples from literary works, this is one. In terms of grammar, it focuses on areas that actually have problems; in terms of rhetoric, it is more passive than active, this is two. The scope is limited to words and sentences; the arrangement of paragraphs and the structure of entire articles are not discussed, this is three. Supplementation and coordination depend on other books and publications.
    In the past, when friends parted, there was a custom called "parting words." Some readers may hope that we will say one last word. We are often asked: How can we write good articles? It is difficult to say what "good" means. Our own articles are still far from being "good." How to write something that is not too bad, this may be easier to answer. These talks are an attempt to answer this question. If we were to summarize it in one sentence, to point out a guiding principle in one sentence, then we would like to propose: "Do not forget your readers!" Speaking and writing should both be purposeful; however, some people forget their audience when speaking, and even more people forget their readers when writing. If every time you pick up a pen, you imagine that there is a reader standing behind you, watching every word you write, every sentence you write, and if they don't understand, they will say "Huh?" If they are impatient, they will say "Um!" You will definitely be more careful when writing, and carefully revise after writing. Even if it is not well written, at least it will not be too bad.
    "Do not forget your readers!" Please remember this sentence.

专栏：

    告别读者
    从六月初这个讲话开始和读者相见，已经半年过去了。现在讲话已经完毕，我们的笔就要放下来，有几句话要向读者交代，也有几点感想要借这个机会说一说。
    自从人民日报六月六日的社论号召“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”以来，语文问题已经受到普遍的重视，并且在广大群众中展开了学习的运动。当初我们应人民日报之约来编写“语法修辞讲话”，也没想到读者给予它的注意会这样远超过它本身的价值。也曾经听到有人说：在我们的人民国家建设的初期，有多少迫切的工作需要我们时刻不懈地努力，帝国主义和反动派还没有消灭，抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命这三大运动正在轰轰烈烈地进行，哪有闲工夫来“咬文嚼字”？是的，假如仅仅是“咬文嚼字”，的确是大可不必的。这个问题之能受到大家的重视，正足以表示大家对于语言的性质有了正确的认识，对于斯大林所揭示的真理有了正确的认识：语言是交流思想的工具，“没有思想交流，便不可能使人们在与自然力的斗争中，在为生产必需的物质财富中调协其共同活动……在这个意义上说，语言既是交际的工具，同时也就是社会斗争和发展的工具。”因为有这个认识，读者才肯耐心阅读这个有时不免枯燥的讲话。也是因为有这个认识，我们才敢不自量力编写这个讲话，占去人民日报这么多的篇幅。说实话，在半年里写下近二十万字的讲话是相当吃力的（尤其因为我们同时还有教学的工作），但是我们终于坚持下来，也还是因为有了这个认识。
    读者给我们的帮助是说不尽的。半年之中，我们收到读者的来信在三百封左右。所有来的信，除了不要回信的，我们尽可能都回复了。也有少数因为当时手上的工作放不下而搁下来，日子一久，觉得失了时效，因而没有复信的，在此谢罪。来信里面有些跟我们讨论语法体系以及一些理论上的问题的，从这里面我们得到不少启发，只可惜这个讲话偏重在实用方面，因而限制我们在这方面充分展开讨论。有些来信是指点我们的错误以及在体例方面提供意见的，从这里面我们得益最多。举一个例，在第五讲的第八段“不合事实”节，我们引了一句——“江南地区因雨水过多，要注意排水工作，雨后要发动农民锄草，以保持土中水分，使土质疏松干燥”——并且加以按语，说：草可以保持水分，锄了草怎么还能保持水分？后来在先后十天之内接到三位读者的来信，说明雨后锄草，疏松表土，确有保持地下水分的作用。（但是原文没说明是“表土”而泛说“土质”，又上面说“排水”，下面又说保持水分，实在有点交代不清，所以在单行本里把它移在“费解”节内。）又如第二讲第一段里引了一个例句，里面有美国下流影片的名字。第二讲单行本所附习题里有两句是“美国水果商人必须降低美国水果的价钱，并且多做广告，来打破中国的水果市场”；“所以主张对地主们不必经过激烈的斗争，也不要过分强调阶级斗争，认为和平土改是可以做到的”。都蒙读者来信指出。我们在刊物上摘取例句的时候也曾顾虑到脱离上下文有断章取义的危险，但是还是警惕不够，以致有这一类例句漏过。只是读者来信已晚，只能先在这里引咎，将来再在合订本里改正了。又曾有好几位读者来信，嫌说明过于简略，与例句的配合不显。这一点倒是早就想到的。原来打算每个例句里的有关词语都加着重点，后来因为在报纸上太占篇幅，不得已而省去，对于读者的确有点不便。印单行本的时候都重行加上了。
    来信最多的是要求回答疑问的。其中有跟这个讲话的内容有关的，例如“的”“底”“地”的区别，来问这个问题的就有二三十位。第三讲第三段里谈到这三个字，可是举例不够多。借这个机会总回答一句：“请参考联共（布）党史简明教程”的中译本，那里面区分这三个字，例子极多。另外有一些来信跟讲话的内容没有直接关系：有问某一个字是不是白字的，有问某一句是不是不通的，有寄文章来修改的。我们想，各地的语文刊物和教育刊物都可以设立“问题解答”栏，担当起这项任务（事实上有些刊物已经这样做）。同时，要是有一本适合时代要求的字典，也能解决好些问题，免得写信去问人。这实在是当前十分迫切的需要。
    我们这个讲话谈到的问题不算少，但仍然不是一个全面性的东西。它有特定的读者对象——一般工作干部。这就限制了它的内容。偏重实用文，在文艺作品里取例很少，此其一。在语法方面，着重实际上有问题的地方，在修辞方面，消极多于积极，此其二。范围不外乎词和句，段落的安排和整篇的结构都不在讨论之列，此其三。补充和配合，有待于别的书刊。
    从前，朋友离别的时候，有所谓“临别赠言”。读者之中也许有希望我们最后说一句话的。我们常常被人询问：怎样把文章写好？写好很难说，我们自己的文章就还离“好”字远得很。怎样就能写得不太糟，这也许还比较容易回答，这个讲话就是回答这一问题的一个企图。假如要我们用一句话来概括，用一句话来指出一个指导原则，那末，我们想提出：“不要忘记你的读者！”说话和写文章都应该有的放矢；可是有些人说话忘记听众，更多的人写文章忘记读者。倘若每回拿起笔来，都想像有一位读者站在你的背后，你写一个字他看一个字，你写一句他看一句，他不懂就要“嗄？”他不耐烦就要“唔！”必定写起来加倍小心，写过后用心修改，即使写得不好，至少不至于太糟。
    “不要忘记你的读者！”请记住这一句。
