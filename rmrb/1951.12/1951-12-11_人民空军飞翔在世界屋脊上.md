    People's Air Force Flies Over the Roof of the World

    Tibet has been peacefully liberated. The Tibetan people are marching from darkness and suffering towards brightness and happiness.

    Last year, when the ground forces of the People's Liberation Army marched into Tibet to liberate the frontier of the motherland, traversing the muddy and humid grasslands and climbing the snow-capped peaks of the sparsely populated Kang-Tibet Plateau, the People's Air Force also created an unprecedented miracle.

    The Kang-Tibet Plateau, thousands of feet above sea level, has always been known as the roof of the world. Because of its towering peaks, misty clouds, and frequent large air currents and vortices, the Kang-Tibet Plateau has always been regarded as a "no-fly zone." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, American aerial bandits attempted to open a route to India through here to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang prepare for a counter-revolutionary war. After several trial flights, the planes crashed into the mountains and were destroyed. In the end, they had to detour through the Hump, where China, Burma, and India meet. The young People's Air Force, with its infinite loyalty to the motherland, overcame all difficulties, opened up a new air route over the Kang-Tibet Plateau, successfully completed the arduous airdrop mission, and provided powerful support to the ground forces.

    The first and second test flights both returned due to bad weather. The young pilots were not discouraged and continued to explore and advance relentlessly.

    For the third test flight, the weather was still warm and breezy, with clear skies, before takeoff. But halfway there, the weather gradually deteriorated, and everything was covered in clouds and mist. "What should we do? Are we going to fail again?"

    "Since we're here, we have to see this through and climb higher!" The airmen clearly knew that it was very dangerous to pass through this area of high altitude with clouds and mist. But Tibet must be liberated, and if the airdrop mission could not be completed, it would affect the progress and victory of the troops. "Keep going!" So they increased the throttle and pulled the plane two thousand feet out of the clouds, flying forward at lightning speed. The closer they got, the more the continuous high mountains blocked their way like city walls. The brave and calm pilots aimed for a mountain pass and entered the valley. At this time, the air vortices were even greater, and the plane was out of control, rising and falling hundreds of meters at a time. Everyone felt dizzy due to lack of oxygen. Five minutes later, the terrain was a little flatter, but below was still a vast sea of clouds. Looking up, there was a blue sky. The only thing that could be identified was a certain peak of more than 24,600 feet, standing beside them like a giant wearing a white summer hat. Judging from the terrain and time, the destination was below. So they flew in low circles overhead for a few laps and flew back the way they came.

    As soon as the plane landed, the comrades at the airport said, "The ground troops have sent a telegram saying that they heard the plane circling overhead, but they didn't see it go down." This news gave the air force personnel infinite strength. The door to entering the Kang-Tibet Plateau from the air was finally opened. Everyone jumped up with joy for the successful test flight. The airmen all checked their planes, equipment, and airdrop supplies, and prepared to take off the next day.

    The next day, the plane soared at an altitude of 20,000 feet, flew over the snow-capped mountains and valleys, and headed southwest. When they reached the destination, the pilots were extremely excited. Below were the brother troops who had traveled a long distance! The white markers on the drop zone were also laid out, and everyone immediately became nervous and dropped the military supplies in order. Parachutes, like flowers, floated in the air, shining with silvery white light.

    As the troops entering Tibet progressed westward, the air transport line also had to extend westward. The further west they went, the worse the flight environment became. After three more test flights, finally, under the leadership of Air Force hero Comrade Wang Hongzhi, with tenacious perseverance, they eliminated various obstacles and dangers, and continuously transported supplies to the advancing troops entering Tibet.

    The success of the airlift gave the ground troops great encouragement. Whenever the comrades in front carried dozens of pounds of luggage and marched on the alpine grasslands, they would look up and cheer incessantly when they saw our aircraft formation flying by. This deep combat friendship, from the sky to the ground, encouraged each other, making everyone forget their fatigue and take heroic steps forward. They had only one common will:

    "Plant the victorious red flag on the Himalayas" and close the door for imperialist aggression on our western border.

    人民空军飞翔在世界屋脊上
    孔繁根
    西藏和平解放了。西藏人民正从黑暗和痛苦中向着光明和幸福迈进。
    去年，当人民解放军地面部队为了解放祖国边疆，在罕见人烟的康藏高原上穿过泥泞潮湿的草地，爬过终年积雪的高峰，向西藏进军的时候，人民空军部队也创造了史无前例的奇迹。
    康藏高原拔海一呎，一向被称为世界的屋脊。因为峰峦突起，云雾迷漫，高原上经常发生巨大的气流漩涡；康藏高原一向被人视为“航空禁区”。在抗日战争时期，美国空中强盗曾企图由这里开辟通往印度的航线，帮助蒋介石匪帮进行反革命战争的准备。数次试航，飞机都撞山焚毁。最后只得绕道中缅交界的驼峰。年青的人民空军，以自己对祖国的无限忠诚，克服了一切困难，开辟了康藏高原的新航线，胜利地完成了艰巨的空投任务，给陆地部队以有力支援。
    第一次，第二次试航，都因气候不好而回航了。年青的飞行员们并没有泄气，仍然不屈不挠地探索前进。
    第三次试航，起飞前还是日暖风轻、万里无云的好天气。但是到达中途，气候就渐渐变坏，满目都是云雾了。“怎么办？是不是又完不成任务了？”
    “既然来了，这一次总得看个究竟，往上爬！”航空员们清楚地知道，冒云雾通过这一带的高空，是非常危险的。但西藏一定要解放，如果空投任务不能完成，就要影响部队的进展与胜利。“继续前进！”于是加大油门，把飞机拔出云层两千呎，风驰电掣地向前飞去。越飞越近，像城墙一样连绵的高山迎面挡住了去路。英勇沉着的驾驶员们就对准
    一山口驶去，进入了山谷。这时候气流漩涡更大，飞机不由人操纵，一升一降数百公尺。每个人都因缺乏氧气，感到眼睛发花。五分钟之后，地势比较平坦了些，但是下面仍是茫茫的云海。仰望上边，是蔚蓝色的天空。唯一可以识别的，就是二万四千六百余呎的某高峰，像戴着白色夏帽的巨人屹立在旁边。以地形、时间判断，目的地就在下面。于是在上空低飞盘旋了几个圈子，就从原路飞回来了。
    飞机刚着陆，机场上的同志们就说：“地面部队已来电报，他们说听到了飞机在上空兜圈子，就是不见下去。”这个消息给了空军人员无限的力量，从空中进入康藏高原的大门终于打开了。大家都为试航成功而高兴得跳起来。航空员们都检查了自己的飞机、装备、空投物资，准备明天起飞。
    第二天，飞机翱翔在二万呎高空，掠过了终年积雪的高山幽谷，向着西南飞去。当到达目的地上空时，飞行员们都兴奋极了。下面就是长途跋踄的兄弟部队啊！空投场上的白色标志也摆出来了，大家立刻紧张起来，把军用物资顺次的投下去了。飘在空中如花朵一样的降落伞，闪耀着银白色的光芒。
    随着入藏部队的向西进展，空运线也必须向西延伸。越往西，飞行环境越恶劣。又经过了三次试航，最后在空军英雄王洪智同志的带领下，以坚韧不拔的毅力排除了各种阻碍和危险，终于把物资不断运送到前进中的入藏部队手里。
    空运的成功，给了地面部队很大鼓舞。每当前方的同志们背着几十斤重的行囊在高山草地上行进时，一看到我们的机群列队飞过，就仰起头来欢呼不息。这种深厚的战斗的友谊，从天空到地面，互相鼓舞着，使大家忘记了疲劳，向前迈着英勇的步伐。他们只有一个共同的意志：
    “把胜利的红旗插在喜马拉雅山上”，把帝国主义侵略我国西部边疆的大门关闭起来。
