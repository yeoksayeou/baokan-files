    Serious Waste in the Dormitory Project of the People's Bank of China, Chahar Province Branch

    To the Editor: The People's Bank of China, Chahar Province Branch, is building a new project in Zhangjiakou, which is being completed in two phases. In the first phase of constructing dormitories, serious extravagance and waste occurred. For example, the toilet partitions, dormitory kang edges, chairs and tables are all made of red pine, consuming a total of 27,600 cai (300 cai equal one cubic meter), costing 15,000 yuan per cai, totaling 414 million yuan. If poplar wood were used instead of red pine, each cai would only cost 5,000 yuan, saving 276 million yuan. The dormitory windows are double-layered, and if one layer is removed, red pine materials worth more than 86 million yuan can be saved. In terms of material management, due to their carelessness, more than 10,000 jin of white ash were blown away by strong winds, and the damage to bricks and tiles resulted in a total loss of more than 60 million yuan. Due to sloppy construction, the cement floors (3,000 square meters) in the rooms and corridors have cracks and need to be reworked, which is estimated to result in another loss of 110 million yuan. There are also many other aspects of waste. According to statistics, the total loss is about 680 million yuan.

    中国人民银行察哈尔省分行
    宿舍工程有严重浪费现象
    编辑同志：中国人民银行察哈尔省分行在张家口新建工程一处，分两期完成。在第一期建筑宿舍的工程中，发生严重铺张浪费现象。比如厕所的隔离板、宿舍的炕沿、椅桌等都用红松，共用去二万七千六百才（三百才合一立方公尺），每才以一万五千元计算，共费四亿一千四百万元。这些红松如代以杨木，每才只要五千元，可节省二亿七千六百万元。宿舍的窗户都是双层的，如减去一层，可节省红松材料等价值八千六百多万元。在材料管理方面，由于他们粗枝大叶，竟被大风吹走白灰一万多斤，加上砖瓦损坏等共损失六千多万元。因施工马虎，室内和走廊的洋灰地（三千平方公尺）都有了裂缝，需要返工，估计又要损失一亿一千万元。其他方面的浪费也很多。据统计，总共损失约六亿八千多万元。    　卢　起
