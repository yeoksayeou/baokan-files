    We Must Strive to Develop the Motherland's Petroleum Treasures
    ——Reflections on the National Petroleum Exhibition

    Editor: We visited the National Petroleum Exhibition and received a profound patriotic education. On our vast territory, there are extremely rich petroleum resources. However, imperialist-hired experts once said that China had no oil. The Kuomintang reactionary government only worked to promote American imperialist oil, causing the petroleum industry to wither away. Now, only two years after the national liberation, we have transformed the dilapidated mess we inherited into a thriving people's petroleum industry. Oil wells and refineries are being restored or newly built one after another, and oil production has exceeded the highest historical level. These achievements are the result of the working class fully utilizing its potential capabilities under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Special mention should be made of the Soviet Union's selfless assistance. They helped us overcome the imperialist blockade, provided us with the necessary equipment, and introduced us to advanced experiences, enabling China's petroleum industry to develop rapidly. Our motherland has so many treasures, and the development of these treasures requires a large number of cadres. We are all determined to work hard to improve our political awareness and study technology to meet the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the people.

### 我们要为开发祖国石油宝藏而奋斗——全国石油展览会观后感

    我们要为开发祖国石油宝藏而奋斗
    ——全国石油展览会观后感
    编辑同志：我们参观了全国石油展览会，受到了深刻的爱国主义教育。在我国辽阔的国土上，本来蕴藏着极其丰富的石油，但帝国主义御用专家却曾说我国没有石油。国民党反动政府只做了推销美帝国主义石油的工作，使石油事业萎缩不堪。现在，全国解放不过两年，我们就把接过来的破烂摊子，变成欣欣向荣的人民石油事业。油井精炼厂一个又一个修复或新建起来，产油量已经超过历史最高水平。这些成就是在共产党和毛主席的领导下，工人阶级充分发挥了潜在能力的结果。特别应当提出的是苏联大公无私的援助。他们帮助我们战胜帝国主义的封锁，供给我们必需的设备，介绍给我们先进经验，使我国石油事业迅速发展起来。我们祖国有这样多的宝藏，这宝藏的开发需要大量干部。我们都决心努力提高政治觉悟，钻研技术，来迎接人民交给我们的光荣任务。
