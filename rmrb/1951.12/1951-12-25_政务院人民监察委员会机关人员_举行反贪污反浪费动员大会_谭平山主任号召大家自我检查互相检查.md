    Organs of the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council Hold Mobilization Meeting Against Corruption and Waste
    Director Tan Pingshan Calls on Everyone to Self-Examine and Mutually Examine
    [By Our Newspaper] The People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government held a mobilization meeting on the 17th for its staff to oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The meeting began with a report by Director Tan Pingshan. Director Tan said: A large-scale production increase and economy drive will soon be launched nationwide. To increase production and practice economy, we must oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, because if there is corruption and waste, we cannot practice strict economy, and if there is bureaucracy, corruption and waste will occur at any time. Director Tan pointed out: The phenomena of corruption and waste are now very serious. They have harmed the interests of the country and the people, hindered the connection between the government and the people, and created adverse effects. It would be very dangerous if we let it develop. Director Tan called on all staff members of the organs to self-examine, mutually examine, examine from top to bottom, correct shortcomings, and improve further. This was followed by a speech by Deputy Director Liu Jingfan. Deputy Director Liu first explained the significance of launching the current movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. At the same time, he cited cases of corruption and waste handled by the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council to illustrate the seriousness of the current phenomenon of corruption and waste. He said that not only other organs have corruption and waste, but our supervisory organs also have them. Deputy Director Liu called on the working cadres of the organs to take immediate action, actively carry out economy inspections, and create conditions for carrying out a large-scale production increase and economy drive. He instructed the cadres to study documents, raise awareness, promote democracy, launch criticism and self-criticism, conduct extensive inspections, expose facts of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, overcome the bad habits of the old society, and serve the people perfectly. Finally, Deputy Director Pan Zhenya spoke. He encouraged adopting the attitude of "knowing everything and saying everything" to participate in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
