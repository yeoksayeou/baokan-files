Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: TASS Moscow, December 3rd dispatch: TASS issued the following statement: A few days ago, a U.S. military transport plane intruded into Romanian territory near the town of Resita, then flew over Romanian territory and intruded into Hungarian territory in the area of Giula, attempting to fly over Hungarian territory. However, the plane crossed into the Soviet Air Force zone stationed in Hungary according to Article 22 of the peace treaty and was forced to land at the Baba area airfield by a Soviet fighter on duty at the time. After interrogating the flight crew, it was determined that the personnel on the invading aircraft were: Captain Henderson, the pilot; Captain Swift, the co-pilot; Sergeant Duff, the aviation mechanic; and Sergeant Albert-Iliam, the radio operator. The invading military transport plane belonged to the 85th Wing of the 12th Air Force of the U.S. Air Force. An inspection of the aircraft proved that its flight instruments, communication equipment, and other equipment were intact and undamaged, allowing it to fly in adverse weather conditions and at night. All of the above, as well as a study of the flight route, coupled with the fact that the plane had some skilled personnel, indicated that this U.S. military transport plane deliberately intruded into the Romanian and Hungarian borders for a specific purpose. The items found on the U.S. aircraft illustrated the purpose of this premeditated border violation.

After inspecting the aircraft, the following items were found:
	(1) Military operational maps of the most important regions of the Soviet Union – including the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Volga River region – as well as maps of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Hungary.
	(2) A lightweight radio transceiver, soft-padded and packaged, with a device for dropping by parachute. The transceiver was not for use on the aircraft but was specifically designed for use in field conditions.
	(3) Six parachutes. Based on their number and placement inside the aircraft, it can be judged that they were not intended for use by the crew but for other purposes.
	(4) Several packages ready to be dropped from the aircraft, including twenty blankets.

The intrusion of the U.S. military transport plane into the Hungarian and Romanian borders, the length of time the plane flew over these two countries, the type of aircraft and landing equipment, and the operational maps of the aforementioned countries found on board, all prove that the plane was dispatched by the U.S. military and bore the sinister mission of dropping spies and saboteurs into people's democratic countries and Soviet territory.

It is obvious that the aforementioned items are not needed for a normal flight. However, if the aircraft was flying with sinister intentions, with the aim of spreading spies and saboteurs for the U.S. espionage agency and providing them with supplies, then the presence of these items is understandable.

In this regard, the confessions of the invading aircraft personnel are noteworthy. They stated that the route drawn up for them by the U.S. military included a visit to Yugoslavia. Authoritative sources in the Soviet Command believe that the results of the investigation into the facts and related circumstances of the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into Hungarian territory give every reason to conclude that the aircraft's mission to visit Yugoslavia was to carry Yugoslav spies and saboteurs, and then drop them into Soviet and People's Democratic countries to carry out sabotage activities.

According to information obtained by TASS, the U.S. military aircraft that was forced to land on Hungarian territory and its personnel have been handed over by the Soviet military to the Hungarian authorities.

    美国军用运输机一架侵入罗匈国境
    阴谋投下间谍从事破坏活动
    这架美机已被苏联战斗机强迫降落；机上人员已移交匈牙利当局
  【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日电：塔斯社发表声明如下：几天以前，美国军用运输机一架在列西塔镇附近侵入罗马尼亚国境，接着飞越罗马尼亚领土，在朱拉镇地区侵入匈牙利国境，并企图飞越匈牙利领土。然而，该机越入了根据和约第二十二条而驻留在匈牙利的苏联空军驻区，被当时值勤的苏联战斗机强迫在巴巴地区的机场着陆。对机上飞行人员进行讯问之后，确定入侵飞机的人员为：机长亨德逊上尉、副驾驶员斯微夫特上尉、航空机械士杜夫上士、无线电报务员阿尔伯—伊廉中士。入侵的军用运输机隶属于美国空军第十二航空队第八十五联队。对该机加以检查之后，证明机上的飞行仪器、通讯设备和其他设备均完整无损，可以在恶劣的气候情况下和在夜间飞行。上述种种以及对飞行路线的研究，再加上机上有些熟练人员的事实，都说明了这架美国军用运输机是为了一定的目的而故意侵入罗马尼亚和匈牙利国境的。在该美国飞机上发现的物品，说明了这次蓄意侵犯边界事件的目的。
    在检查该机之后，计发现了：（一）苏联各最重要地区——包括乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国和伏尔加河地区——的军用作战地图，以及捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和匈牙利的地图。
    （二）轻便无线电收发报机一部，软垫包装，附有以降落伞投下的装置。该收发报机并非飞机上使用的，而是专门设计来在野外情况下使用的。
    （三）降落伞六个。根据其数目和在机内放置的位置，可以判断不是准备供机上人员使用，而是另有用途的。
    （四）准备从机上投下的包裹数个，其中有二十条毯子。
    美国军用运输机的侵入匈牙利和罗马尼亚国境、该机在这两国飞行的时间、飞机的类型和着陆设备、以及在机上发现的上述各国的作战地图，这些事实证明了该机是由美国军方派出，负有把间谍和破坏者投入人民民主国家和苏联领土的罪恶使命。
    很明显，飞机作正常飞行时是不需要上述物品的。但是，如果飞机是怀着罪恶的目的在飞行，怀着替美国间谍机关散布间谍和破坏者以及给他们以供应的目的在飞行，那么，所以有这些物品也就可以理解了。
    在这方面，入侵飞机人员的供述是值得注意的。他们说到，美国军方给他们拟定的路线包括访问南斯拉夫。苏联司令部的权威人士认为，对美国飞机侵入匈牙利国境的事实和有关情况调查的结果，使人完全有理由断定，该机访问南斯拉夫的任务是载运南斯拉夫间谍和破坏者，然后把他们投入苏联和人民民主国家境内，以进行破坏活动。
    据塔斯社获得的消息，这架被强迫在匈牙利领土降落的美国军用飞机和机上人员，已由苏联军方移交给匈牙利当局。
