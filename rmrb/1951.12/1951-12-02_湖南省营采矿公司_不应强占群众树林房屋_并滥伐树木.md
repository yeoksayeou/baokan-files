    Hunan Provincial Mining Company
    Should Not Forcibly Occupy People's Forests and Houses
    and Indiscriminately Fell Trees

    To the Editor: Since the establishment of the Hunan Provincial Mining Company in Ai'an Township, Fifth District, Luxi County, Hunan Province, it has done several things that damage the interests of the people. For example, the company, without the consent of poor peasant Liu Cilian or contacting the local farmers' association, occupied Liu Cilian's tung tree forest as a dormitory for the company's mine. It also felled 52 tung and fir trees belonging to Liu Cilian and three others. Later, in order to open up mine tunnels, it arbitrarily felled more than 1,000 tung trees belonging to Liu Cilian and others. At the same time, the company forcibly occupied a small house that poor peasant Wang Zhixing had obtained during the anti-despot struggle, without compensating for the losses. Therefore, the local farmers are extremely dissatisfied with the company. After discovering this, Shi Heiyi and Jiang Yonglu, staff members of the Fifth District, raised their opinions to the company, but the company ignored them. I believe that the company has seriously damaged the interests of the masses and greatly damaged the prestige of the People's Government among the people. I suggest that the leading body of the company: 1. Promptly investigate and deal with the matter, urge the company to compensate the masses for their losses, make a public self-criticism, and earnestly correct its mistakes; 2. Supervise the company to create a plan for the timber needed for the construction of mines, houses, and roads, submit it to the forestry authorities for approval, and then go to the designated location for logging, so as to avoid arbitrary and indiscriminate felling of trees and damage to forests.
                                                                                                                              Peng Zaide

    湖南省营采矿公司
    不应强占群众树林房屋
    并滥伐树木
    编辑同志：湖南省营采矿公司在湖南省泸溪县第五区爱安乡成立以来，做出了好几桩损害人民利益的事。例如：该公司不经贫农刘次连同意，也未与当地农会联系，就占用了刘次连的桐林，作为该公司矿场宿舍，并且还砍伐了属于刘次连和其他三人的桐树、杉树共五十二株；后来为了开辟矿道，又擅自砍伐刘次连等的桐树一千余株。同时该公司又强迫占用了贫农王之兴在反恶霸斗争时分得的一所小房子，也没有赔偿损失费用。因此，当地农民对该公司极不满意。第五区工作人员石黑义、蒋永禄发觉后，向该公司提出意见，该公司竟置之不理。我认为该公司严重地损害了群众利益，大大损害了人民政府在人民群众中的威信。我建议该公司的领导机关：一、迅速检查处理，督促该公司赔偿群众损失，并公开检讨，切实改正错误；二、对该公司修建矿场、房屋、道路所需木材，应督促其造出计划，送呈林业机关批准后，到指定地点采伐，以免任意滥伐树木破坏森林。  彭载德
