    Nanjing Radio Factory Discovers Serious Backlog of Funds During Asset Inventory

    Editor: The Nanjing Radio Factory discovered serious waste during its asset inventory. The factory has enough woodworking saw blades in storage to last for five years. The factory purchased a batch of motors for use with drilling machines, but because the specifications were not clearly stated, they found that they were too large to use after they were purchased, but they could not be returned, resulting in a loss of 15 million yuan. In 1950, the factory submitted 13 tons of soft lead sheeting, but then, fearing that this material would be unavailable, they requisitioned it back from the central government. According to the production plan, this item was not needed at all, resulting in a backlog of 140 million yuan. In the material warehouse, the factory has vacuum tubes worth 6 billion yuan, various types of wire worth 3.25 billion yuan, hardware materials (copper sheets, iron sheets, etc.) worth 949 million yuan, insulation materials worth 3.8 billion yuan, clear transformer oil worth more than 100 million yuan, and idle machinery and generators worth 2.49 billion yuan. Based solely on the above known figures, the Nanjing Radio Factory has a backlog of funds totaling 18 billion yuan. The factory also experiences serious waste during the production process. Recently, the factory lost 100 kilograms of copper wire due to using the wrong materials. The factory also frequently experiences rework waste, with wasted man-hours often reaching tens or hundreds of hours. The main causes of this waste are poor design, chaotic systems, and the factory leadership's focus on production to the neglect of management. Through this asset inventory and anti-waste exhibition, the leading cadres and workers of the Nanjing Radio Factory have initially eliminated parochialism and the idea of relying on materials for a living, but implementing an economic accounting system will require a great deal of effort.

    南京无线电厂在清理资产中发现严重积压资金现象
    编辑同志：南京无线电厂在清理资产中，发现严重的浪费现象。这个电厂贮存木工锯条可供五年用。电厂购置过一批供钻床配用的马达，因为没有详细开明规格，买回来后才发现太大不能使用，但又不能退货，以致损失了一千五百万元。电厂在一九五○年曾上缴软性铅皮十三吨，后来又怕买不到这种货，就又从中央调拨回来。按生产计划，这项东西根本用不着，以致积压资金十四亿元。在材料库中，电厂存着真空管值六十亿元，各种类型线值三十二亿五千万元，五金材料（铜皮铁皮等）值九亿四千九百万元，绝缘器材值三十八亿元，清变压器油值一亿多元，搁置的机器设备和发电机值二十四亿九千万元。只拿以上所知数字来说，南京无线电厂积压资金已达一百八十亿元。电厂在生产过程中的浪费也很严重，最近曾因用错材料，损失紫铜线一百公斤。电厂也经常发生返工浪费现象，浪费工时常达几十几百小时。造成这种浪费的主要原因是设计不周密和制度混乱，以及电厂领导方面只顾生产不问经营的作风。通过这次清理资产和反浪费展览会，南京无线电厂领导干部和工人已初步消除了本位主义思想和喜新厌旧靠材料吃饭的观点，但要实行经济核算制，还需要很大的努力。
