    At the beginning of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the administrative leaders of the Transportation Division of Fushun Coal Mine believed that the task of increasing production and practicing economy mainly relied on saving materials and utilizing waste materials. Therefore, they focused all day on asking the material clerks to calculate how much could be saved from this material and how much from that material. In September, although the idea of simply saving materials and utilizing waste materials was criticized at the mine-wide cadre meeting, and it was proposed that the task of increasing production and practicing economy should be approached from the perspective of tapping the potential of machinery, after this meeting, the leaders of the Transportation Division still did not fully understand the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, they only held a meeting of division-level cadres and technical personnel, put forward fifteen methods for exploiting potential capabilities, and printed them into a booklet for distribution to cadres, without thinking of mobilizing the masses to tap the potential of machinery. As a result, many grassroots cadres said, "I will do whatever the higher-ups tell me to do!" Some also said:
    "Our potential capabilities have already been tapped!" Therefore, they did not go on to mobilize the masses to engage in increasing production and practicing economy.
    The Party General Branch of the Transportation Division also limited its leadership of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to putting forward empty slogans. Although the cadres of the trade union and the Communist Youth League talked to the workers every day about tapping potential, they did not know how to start. After hearing the news of the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the workers were in high spirits, but they did not know in which direction to make efforts, and they just picked up brake shoes and screws everywhere; some teams and groups even launched competitions for this. In this way, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in the Transportation Division did not actually unfold.
    In response to the above situation, the working group of the Fushun Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out to the Party General Branch of the Transportation Division: this approach is not correct; the key to carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement lies in mobilizing the masses and providing rationalization proposals. According to this instruction, the Party General Branch suggested that the administrative leaders of the division convene a division-level cadre meeting to study the mine director's report on carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement and relevant documents. Everyone unanimously believed that the Transportation Division had potential, for example, the utilization rate of electric locomotives was only 53 percent. In this way, everyone realized that mobilizing the masses to provide rationalization proposals and tapping potential was an urgent problem to be solved.
    Then, the administrative side convened a meeting of grassroots cadres, explained in detail the great significance of using the tapping of potential to complete the increase of production and economy, and announced to everyone the potential situation initially calculated by the leadership. The grassroots cadres discussed while putting forward their own rationalization proposals. At this time, the Party organization emphasized that everyone must mobilize the masses to discuss together, so that every employee can understand the meaning and direction of this movement. Therefore, the cadres were assigned to each shift to discuss and study with the masses. At the same time, the Party General Branch put forward three tasks for Party members and League members: in addition to actively putting forward rationalization proposals themselves, Party members and League members should mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals and publicize and explain the purpose of the rationalization proposal movement to every worker. Party members, League members, and propagandists immediately responded to the Party's call and carried out publicity and education to the workers. Party member Tian Fushui mobilized the entire group to put forward several rationalization proposals; Kang Yulian studied technical problems with the veteran workers and mobilized all the workers in the group to put forward rationalization proposals. However, many workers still had such concerns in their minds: "If you make suggestions, no one will solve them, it's a waste of time." In order to solve this problem, the Party General Branch also suggested that the administrative leaders of the division decide that the division-level cadres and technical personnel should be responsible for handling rationalization proposals. And a discipline was established, and cadres who intentionally suppressed workers' suggestions would be criticized and punished. In addition, it assisted the trade union in convening a forum for technical personnel, so that they could understand that this movement was a good opportunity for the combination of technical personnel and workers. It mobilized technical personnel to also go to each group to review rationalization proposals: for those that are reasonable, they should be analyzed, affirmed, and their value calculated; for those that are half-reasonable, they should be studied and supplemented with the workers to make them reasonable; for those that are unreasonable, they should explain to the workers the reasons why they are unreasonable. So as to do a good job of technical appraisal.
    After the above ideological mobilization and preparation, the whole division set off a warm rationalization proposal movement. The workers' emotions were particularly high. Everyone rushed to make suggestions, fearing that they would be too late. The enthusiasm of the technical personnel was also increased, and they were responsible for analyzing and studying the workers' rationalization proposals. Starting from October 4th, in just two weeks, the entire division received 479 rationalization proposals. Except for 41 pieces that still need to be studied, the others are all reasonable. Some have already been implemented and have yielded great benefits. For example, there are ten electric picks below the fifth section in the pit, which can produce six or seven trips of cars per hour, but it takes ten minutes for one trip from the fifth section to the fourth section; that is to say, the fifth section can only produce six trips per hour, which results in the phenomenon of car congestion in the fifth section. One suggestion was to put a block signal in the middle of the fourth and fifth sections, so that the fifth section can send out a train every five minutes, which improves the transportation cycle and yields benefits equivalent to 365 tons of grain.
    In this way, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in the Transportation Division has truly unfolded.

### 中共抚顺煤矿运输股总支怎样发动群众提合理化建议的？

    中共抚顺煤矿运输股总支怎样发动群众提合理化建议的？
    增产节约运动刚开始的时候，抚顺煤矿运输股的行政领导干部曾认为：增产节约的任务，主要是依靠节约材料利用废料来完成。因此他们整天抓住材料员计算从这种材料里节省多少，从那种材料里节省多少。九月间，虽曾在全矿的干部会议上，批判了这种单纯节省材料利用废料的思想，提出应该从发掘机械的潜在能力着眼来完成增产节约任务。但在这次会议以后，运输股的领导干部仍然没有很好地领会增产节约的精神；所以只是召开了股一级干部与技术人员会议，提出了十五条发挥潜在能力的方法，并印成小册子分发到干部中去，还没有想到发动群众挖掘机械的潜在能力。这样，很多基层干部就说：“上级叫我作什么就作什么！”也有的说：
    “我们的潜在能力早就发掘出来啦！”因之就不再去发动群众搞增产节约了。
    运输股的党总支对于增产节约工作的领导也只限于提一些空洞的口号。工会、青年团的干部虽则天天向工人群众讲挖掘潜在力，但也不知道应怎样着手去挖掘。工人群众听到开展增产节约运动的消息后，情绪很高，但也不知道向什么方向努力，只是到处检闸瓦、拾螺丝；有些队与队、小组与小组之间为此还展开了竞赛。这样运输股的增产节约运动实际上没有展开。
    中共抚顺煤矿委员会工作组针对上述情况，向运输股党总支提出：这种作法不对，开展增产节约运动的关键是在于发动群众，提供合理化建议。根据这一指示，党总支建议股的行政领导方面召开了股
    一级的干部会议，研究了矿长关于开展增产节约运动的报告和有关文件，大家一致认为运输股是有潜在力的，例如电车的运用率只达百分之五十三。这样，大家认识了发动群众提供合理化建议，发掘潜在力量，是当前急待解决的问题。
    接着行政方面召开了基层干部会议，详细地讲解了用挖掘潜在力来完成增产节约的重大意义，并把领导上初步计算出的潜在力的情况向大家宣布。基层干部就一面讨论，一面提出自己的合理化建议。这时党的组织强调指出，大家必须发动群众一起讨论，使每个职工都能了解这一运动的意义和方向。于是干部分工到各班去和群众一起讨论研究。同时党总支向党员、团员提出三项任务：党员、团员除自己积极提合理化建议外，应动员群众提合理化建议，向每个工人宣传解释合理化建议运动的目的。党员、团员、宣传员马上响应了党的号召，向工人进行宣传教育。党员田福水发动全组提出了几条合理化建议；康玉连与老工人一齐研究技术问题，并把全组工友发动起来提合理化建议。但是不少工人思想上还存在这样的顾虑：“提了意见，没有人给解决，白提。”为了解决这一问题，党总支又建议行政领导方面决定股一级的干部和技术人员分工负责处理合理化建议。并订出纪律，对有意打击工人建议的干部要给予批评与处分。此外，协助工会召开了技术人员座谈会，使他们懂得这个运动是技术人员与工人结合的好机会。发动技术人员也分工到各组去审查合理化建议：对于合理的，就要加以分析，予以肯定并计算出它的价值；半合理的，和工人去研究补充，使之合理；对不合理的要向工人说明不合理的理由。以便作好技术鉴定工作。
    经过上述的思想动员和酝酿，全股掀起了热烈的合理化建议运动。工人的情绪特别高涨。大家抢着提建议，怕晚了提不上。技术人员的积极性也提高了，负责地分析研究工人的合理化建议。从十月四日开始，只两个星期，全股就收到合理化建议四百七十九件。这些建议除四十一件尚须研究外，其他都是合理的。有些已经实行，收益很大。例如坑内五段以下有十台电镐，每小时可出六七趟车，但由五段到四段一趟就须要十分钟；也就是说，五段每小时只能出六趟车，这样结果就造成五段压车的现象。有一条建议就是在这个四段到五段中间放一个闭塞信号，五段就可以五分钟出一趟车，这样就提高了运输周期，收益折合粮食三百六十五吨。
    这样运输股的增产节约运动真正展开了。
