    Firmly Stand on the Party's Position in the Struggle Against the Enemy
    In all struggles against the enemy, a Communist Party member must soberly stand firm on the Party's position, first distinguish right from wrong from a class viewpoint, and never blur the line between the enemy and ourselves because of family relationships. Otherwise, it will inevitably waver, and even embark on a shameful path like Yu Mingchuan.
    The great land reform and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries have affected some Communist Party members' families. Under these circumstances, some Communist Party members could not withstand the test. Instead of clearly drawing a line between themselves and their landlord class families, they became prisoners of the landlords or counter-revolutionaries. Some of them, even though they clearly knew that their family members were landlords or counter-revolutionaries, racked their brains to find excuses and ways to exonerate the landlord or counter-revolutionary families. Thus, rumors such as "the crime is not big," "the humanity is still good," "can be reformed," "started with labor, should not be struggled against," etc., were all brought before the People's Government and the masses who were engaged in a tense struggle with the enemy. Some even used their positions and adopted some rogue tactics—threatening and intimidating the masses—in order to achieve the purpose of shielding landlords or counter-revolutionaries.
    Some of these people's actions are fundamentally not up to the standards of a basic Communist Party member; some have even more seriously thrown themselves into the anti-Party, anti-people counter-revolutionary position. Such people are essentially class aliens who have sneaked into the Communist Party, and such elements should of course be purged from within the Communist Party. This is exactly what Party organizations in various places are doing. We fully support the decision to expel Yu Mingchuan from the Party. We demand that every Party member who has ties with landlord families must firmly stand on their class position and soberly wage an irreconcilable struggle against the class enemy in order to uphold the Party's principles.

### 在对敌斗争中站稳党的立场

    在对敌斗争中站稳党的立场
    一个共产党员，在一切对敌斗争场合，必须清醒地站稳党的立场，首先从阶级观点分清是非，决不能因为亲属关系而模糊了敌我界线。否则，就不可避免地会动摇起来，以致走上像俞铭传这样的可耻道路。
    伟大的土地改革和镇压反革命运动，曾经波及到一部分共产党员的家属。在这种情况下面，有些共产党员，经不起考验，他们不是首先同自己的地主阶级的家庭划清明确的敌我界线，而是作了地主或反革命分子的俘虏。他们有的虽然明明知道自己的家属是地主或反革命，却偏偏挖空心思地找藉口，想办法，为地主或反革命的家属排解开脱。于是“罪恶不大”，“人性还好”，“能够改造”，“劳动起家，不该斗争”等等谰言，就一股脑儿地搬到了人民政府的面前，搬到了正在同敌人进行紧张斗争的群众面前。他们有的甚至利用职位，采取一些流氓手段——威胁、恫吓群众，借以达到包庇地主或反革命分子的目的。
    这些人的行动，有的根本不够一个起码的共产党员的条件；有的更严重地投到反党反人民的反革命立场上去。这种人实质上是混到共产党内的阶级异己分子，这种分子当然应该从共产党内部清除出去，各地的党组织也正是这样作了。俞铭传就是最近被清除的一个。我们完全拥护开除俞铭传党籍的决定。要求每一个同地主家庭有着联系的党员必须站稳自己的阶级立场，清醒地为坚持党的原则去同阶级敌人进行不调和的斗争。
