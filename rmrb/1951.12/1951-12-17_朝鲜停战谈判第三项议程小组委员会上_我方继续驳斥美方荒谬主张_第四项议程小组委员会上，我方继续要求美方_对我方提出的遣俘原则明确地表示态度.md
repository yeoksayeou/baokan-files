Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: At the Third Agenda Subcommittee of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 16th, our side's representative continued to refute the other side's absurd claims that on the one hand, they attempt to interfere in our internal affairs, obstruct the construction of facilities within Korea, and conduct inspections throughout Korea, while on the other hand, they attempt to import unlimited military forces and weapons and ammunition for rotation and replenishment during the armistice. At the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee, our side's representative continued to demand that the other side express a simple and clear attitude towards the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice, as proposed by our side. Our representative pointed out that once the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war is determined, both sides can exchange all prisoner of war information and enter into discussions on the specific arrangements for the prisoner of war issue.
     Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 15th entitled "The U.S. Side's Unreasonable Claims Regarding the Prisoner of War Issue are Absolutely Intolerable," stating that in the discussion on the issue of handling prisoners of war, the U.S. side, as in the past, has rejected our side's reasonable suggestions, creating various obstacles to delaying the negotiations.
    The commentary said: The principle of our side's reasonable suggestion is to enable prisoners of war on both sides to return to their home countries and reunite with their families in a short period of time, which is in line with the spirit of humanitarianism. This reasonable suggestion also reflects the demands of American and British prisoners of war, who are all eager to return home and rejoice with their families. Therefore, they have expressed resentment towards the American warmongers' deliberate delays in the armistice negotiations.
    The commentary said: World public opinion demands that the prisoner of war issue be handled correctly and reasonably to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The entire Korean people will examine the U.S. side's sincerity in the discussion on the prisoner of war issue based on the U.S. side's words and deeds.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程小组委员会上
    我方继续驳斥美方荒谬主张
    第四项议程小组委员会上，我方继续要求美方
    对我方提出的遣俘原则明确地表示态度
    【新华社开城十六日电】十六日的朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方一方面企图干涉我内政，阻挠朝鲜境内设备的修建，并在朝鲜全境进行视察，而另一方面又企图在停战期间无限制地输入军事力量和武器弹药的轮换和补充的荒谬主张。第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续要求对方对我方提出的停战后迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则，简单而明确地表示态度。我方代表指出：迅速释放与遣送全部战俘的原则一经确定，双方即可交换全部战俘的资料，并进入战俘问题具体安排的讨论。
     【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜中央通讯社在十五日以“美方关于俘虏问题的无理主张是绝不能容忍的”为题，发表评论说：美方在关于处理战争俘虏问题的讨论中，和过去一样，拒绝了我方的合理建议，制造着拖延谈判的种种障碍。
    评论说：我方合理建议的原则，在于使双方的战俘能在短期内回到本国和其家人团聚，这是合乎人道主义的精神的。这一合理的建议也反映了美英战俘的要求，他们都急盼回家和其家属欢聚，因此，他们对于美国战争贩子们故意拖延停战谈判的行为，都表示愤恨。
    评论说：世界舆论要求正确合理地处理战俘问题，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决。全朝鲜人民将在关于俘虏问题的讨论中，根据美方的言行来考察美方的诚意。
