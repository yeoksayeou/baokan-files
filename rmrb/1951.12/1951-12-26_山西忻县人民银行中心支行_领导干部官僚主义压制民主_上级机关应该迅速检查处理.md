To the Editor: The leading cadres of the Xin County People's Bank Central Branch in Shanxi Province have a serious bureaucratic style, and individual leading cadres also exhibit phenomena of suppressing democracy. As a result, the enthusiasm of the staff cannot be brought into play, which affects the development of the work. These comrades have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the shortcomings of the subordinate branches. For example, the former head of the Wutai branch once embezzled public funds, engaged in malfeasance, and built houses privately three times without the approval of higher authorities, resulting in a great waste. However, the central branch neither dealt with these wrongdoings nor reported them to the sub-branch. In addition, in the recent selection of model workers, the leading cadres used their own subjective opinions to replace the opinions of the masses, and arranged to elect a person who had no prestige among the masses as a model worker, which aroused great resentment among the masses. During the "May Day" holiday this year, the leading cadres forced all the female comrades to participate in the Yangko dance. Among them, three female comrades were already pregnant, but they dared not refuse because they were afraid of being labeled as ideologically backward. As a result, one female comrade had a miscarriage. After the incident, the leading cadres not only did not pay attention to it, but only allowed the female comrade to rest for two days, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Also, because the leading cadres' work style is undemocratic, many cadres in this central branch have requested to be transferred. One comrade from this branch talked to a comrade sent by the provincial branch to inspect the work, and was actually summoned by the leading cadres to question him: "What did you talk about with the comrades from the sub-branch? Are there any problems that cannot be resolved within our internal organization?"

I believe that the bureaucratic style of the leading cadres of the Xin County People's Bank Central Branch is serious. I hope that the Shanxi Provincial Branch will promptly investigate and handle it, so as to improve the work.

    山西忻县人民银行中心支行
    领导干部官僚主义压制民主
    上级机关应该迅速检查处理
    编辑同志：山西省忻县人民银行中心支行领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，个别领导干部还有压制民主的现象。因此，工作人员的积极性不能发挥，影响了工作的开展。这些同志对所属支行工作人员的缺点，采取了放任自流的态度。如五台支行前任行长曾挪用公款，营私舞弊，并且不经上级批准，私自修建房屋三次，造成很大浪费。但中心支行对这些错误行为既不处理，又不向分行报告。另外，中心支行在最近评选模范时，领导干部用自己主观主义的意见，代替群众的意见，布置评选一个在群众中没有威信的人当模范，引起了群众的极大反感。今年“五一”节时，领导干部强迫女同志全部参加扭秧歌，其中有三个女同志已经怀孕，但因怕戴思想不进步的帽子，不敢不扭。有一个女同志因此小产了。事情发生后，领导干部不但不重视这件事，反而只准那位女同志休息了两天，引起群众极大不满。又因为领导干部作风不民主，这个中心支行有不少干部要求调动工作。这个支行的一个同志和省分行派去检查工作的同志谈了一次话，竟被领导干部叫去质问：“你和分行同志谈什么来？有啥问题在咱内部解决不了？”
    我认为忻县人民银行中心支行领导干部的官僚主义作风是严重的。希望山西省分行迅速加以检查处理，以便改进工作。侯应邦
