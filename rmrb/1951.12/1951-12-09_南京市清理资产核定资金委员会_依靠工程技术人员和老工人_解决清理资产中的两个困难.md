Nanjing Municipal Assets Clearance and Capital Verification Committee
Relies on Engineering Technicians and Veteran Workers
To Solve Two Difficulties in Asset Clearance
Xinhua News Agency

The Nanjing Municipal Assets Clearance and Capital Verification Committee relied on engineers, technicians, and veteran workers to solve the difficulties in machine appraisal and asset valuation.

Machine appraisal and asset valuation are very complex tasks. The Nanjing Municipal Assets Clearance and Capital Verification Committee received over a hundred inquiries from various factories and mines regarding these issues during this process. Some of these issues had solutions already prescribed by the central and East China Assets Clearance and Capital Verification Committees, but others were not addressed in those regulations. For example, the enterprise's main equipment catalog lacked numbering for transportation equipment, and some other equipment either lacked prices or had no specified service life. To standardize the specifications, prices, and service life of various enterprise equipment in Nanjing, the Nanjing Municipal Assets Clearance and Capital Verification Committee mobilized engineers, technicians with professional skills, and experienced veteran workers from various factories and mines to form eleven specialized groups, including working machine tools, power equipment, civil engineering and construction, and transportation equipment. These groups specifically studied the relevant issues raised by each factory and, based on the actual situation, resolved various difficulties in appraisal and valuation. For example, when determining registration units, factories universally faced the question of whether attachments, accessories, and machines should be considered a single registration unit. The power group and machine group jointly studied each case to make a determination. For example, the specification of an electric lathe is that a lathe comes with a motor; the motor and the lathe are a single registration unit. However, for a line shaft lathe (where one motor drives several lathes through a line shaft and belts), the motor is not an accessory of the lathe and should be registered separately: the lathe is entered under the machine equipment category, and the motor is entered under the power equipment category. Once the registration unit is determined, the scope of valuation becomes clear. Another example is the unit of calculation for timber, which varies in Nanjing, including feet, double yards, bundles, and loads. To standardize the unit of calculation, the professional group researched and developed a conversion table to convert all calculation units to cubic meters.

    南京市清理资产核定资金委员会
    依靠工程技术人员和老工人
    解决清理资产中的两个困难
    南京市清理资产核定资金委员会依靠工程师、技术人员和老工人解决了机器鉴定和资产估价的困难。
    机器的鉴定和资产的估价是很复杂的工作。南京市清理资产核定资金委员会在进行这一工作中，收到各厂矿提出的关于这一方面的困难问题共有一百多件。其中有些问题的解决办法，中央和华东的清理资产核定资金委员会已有规定，但有些问题是规定中没有解决的。如企业主要设备目录中就没有运输设备的编号，其他设备又有的没有价格，有的没有耐用年限。为了把南京市各种企业设备的规格、价格和使用年限统一起来，南京市清理资产核定资金委员会就发动各厂矿有专业技术的工程师、技术人员和有丰富经验的老工人，组成工作母机、动力设备、土木建筑、运输器材等十一个专业小组，分别具体研究各厂提出的有关问题，并根据实际情况，解决了鉴定和估价的各种困难。例如：确定登记单位时，各厂普遍存在着附件、配件和机器是否为一个登记单位的问题。动力小组和机器小组就会同逐一研究，加以确定。如电动车床的规格是一部车床带有一只马达，马达和车床就是一个登记单位，天轴车床（一只马达通过天轴和皮带带动几部车床）的马达不是车床的附属设备，这样就应分开登记：车床填入机器设备项内，马达填入动力设备项内。登记单位确定以后，估价的范围也就明确了。再如木料的计算单位，南京市流行的就有英尺、两码、捆、担等。专业小组为了统一计算单位，就研究出一种换算表，把各种计算单位一律折算为立方公尺。（新华社）
