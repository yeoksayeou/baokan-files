    Chaotic Financial Work in Cooperatives at All Levels in Hebei Province
    Serious Accumulation and Waste of Funds
    Preliminary Correction After Asset Clearance
    The Hebei Provincial Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Cooperative, through asset clearance in the first half of the year, exposed serious accumulation and waste of funds and initially reversed the chaotic state of financial work. According to incomplete statistics from the provincial general cooperative, various special district cooperatives, and twenty-four county cooperatives, the total value of accumulated goods reached 17.4536 billion yuan, including 688.77 million yuan worth of accumulated cotton in Wu'an County and 17,000 jin of accumulated wheat in Shenze County. In addition, serious arrears were also one of the reasons for the accumulation and waste of funds. Before the clearance, debts between upper and lower levels in the province amounted to 42.6 billion yuan, and unrecovered loans amounted to 11.179 billion yuan.

    During the asset clearance, the phenomenon of embezzlement and misappropriation of funds by a few cadres of the cooperatives was also exposed. For example, cadres of the Ningtun Cooperative in Yongnian County embezzled more than 1.2 million yuan; the director of the Lianggang Village Cooperative embezzled more than 1.26 million yuan; cadres of the Beiliudian Village Cooperative in Daming County occupied more than 3.84 million yuan of the cooperative's funds, accounting for more than 90% of the cooperative's total funds of 4.23 million yuan. The Xihuayuan Village Cooperative in Cang County collapsed because the director took the lead in collective embezzlement of huge sums of money.

    During the asset clearance, the chaos in the financial work of the primary cooperatives was also exposed. For example, the Qing County Cooperative had more than 7 million yuan of accounts that could not be found; the Duzhai Village Cooperative in Jing County did not know who had deposited 20,000 jin of wheat; the Qing County Cooperative borrowed 200 jin of millet to private merchants, which was delayed for two years without being recovered. When the Qing County Cooperative sought payment from the debtors, it discovered that the debtors held receipts for repayment.

    Through the asset clearance, the chaotic financial phenomena were exposed, reversing the initial idea of some cadres that "there is nothing to clear." Most units also established asset clearance committees in their respective departments to promote the progress of this work.

    The Hebei Provincial Cooperatives at all levels have gradually solved the problems discovered in the asset clearance and have achieved preliminary results. For example, most of the accumulated slow-moving and unpopular goods in most cooperatives have been sold. 65% of the debts between upper and lower-level cooperatives have also been settled. The more than 10 billion yuan of unrecovered loans have been processed by means of recovery, deferred repayment, and exchange of contracts. However, the establishment of sound financial and accounting systems to consolidate the results of the clearance, following closely the clearance work, has not been done adequately in general.

    河北省各级合作社财务工作混乱
    积压和浪费资金现象严重
    经过清理资产已经初步纠正
    河北省合作供销总社，通过上半年的清理资产，揭发了严重的积压、浪费资金现象，初步扭转了财务工作上的混乱状况。根据该省总社、各专区社及二十四个县社不完全的统计，积压货品总值达一百七十四亿五千三百六十余万元，其中武安县积压皮棉价值六亿八千八百七十余元，深泽县积压一万七千斤小麦。另外，严重的拖欠现象，也是积压浪费资金的原因之一。该省上下级在未清理以前，往来欠款有四百二十六亿元，未收回的贷款有一百一十一亿七千九百余万元。
    在清理资产中，同时揭发了合作社少数干部贪污、挪用资金的现象。如永年县宁屯合作社干部贪污一百二十余万元；两岗村社主任贪污一百二十六万余元；大名县北刘店村合作社干部占用合作社的资金三百八十四万余元，占该社全部资金四百二十三万余元的百分之九十以上。沧县西花园村合作社因社主任带头集体贪污巨款，而使合作社垮台。
    在清理资产中，还揭发了基层社财务工作的混乱。如青县合作社有七百多万元的账款查不出来；景县杜桥村合作社有二万斤小麦不知是谁存的；井陉县社借给私商的二百斤小米，竟拖延二年没有索还。青县县社在向欠方索取欠款时，才发现欠户持有归还收据。
    经过清理资产，揭发了财务上的混乱现象，扭转了部分干部在开始时认为“没什么可清的”思想。多数单位并且成立了各该部门的清理资产委员会，以推动这一工作的进行。
    河北省各级合作社对清理资产中发现的问题，已逐步解决，并获得初步成绩。如多数合作社积压的冷、背货大部已推销出去。上下级社相互间的欠款也清结了百分之六十五。未收回的百余亿元贷款，分别采用收回、延期偿还、换约等办法，加以处理。但紧接清理工作之后，建立健全的财务会计制度，以巩固清理的成果，则普遍地做得不够。（毕子文）
