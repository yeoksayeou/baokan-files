    Prevent Extravagance and Waste in Holiday Entertainment Activities

    Comrade Editor: The New Year and Spring Festival are approaching. The vast majority of liberated peasants are overjoyed after a bumper harvest this year. In many areas, peasants have begun to prepare "overturn the body" plays, buy portraits of Chairman Mao, and draw up plans for increasing production and practicing economy in preparation for celebrating the New Year.

    The broad masses of peasants have an urgent need for cultural and recreational activities. In order to ensure that cultural and recreational activities are carried out effectively, I believe that the following matters must be paid attention to: First, the content of cultural and recreational activities must have political significance and be easy to understand, so as to carry out patriotic ideological education through this activity, inspire the political enthusiasm of the peasants, and lay a good foundation for next year's production; Second, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and prevent extravagance and waste. Recently, there have been instances of extravagance and waste in some areas. For example, the rural troupe in Zhugou Town, Er District, Queshan County, Henan Province, has already sold more than 1,000 catties of grain to buy satin clothes, hats, beards, broadswords, etc.; Gaozhuang Township, Si District, spent a lot of money to buy nine gas lamps; Wanglou Township used more than 1,500 catties of wheat to hire a teacher (old artist) to teach opera. There are even individual township and village cadres who force the masses to donate money to buy entertainment supplies, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. All of this should be strictly noted and prevented.

    年节文娱活动要防止铺张浪费
    编辑同志：年节和春节就要到来。广大翻身农民在今年获得丰收以后，莫不欢欣鼓舞。不少地区的农民已在着手编排翻身剧、买毛主席像、订立增产节约计划，准备庆贺新年。
    广大农民对文化娱乐活动的要求是迫切的。为了使文化娱乐活动开展得好，我认为必须注意下面几件事：一、文化娱乐活动的内容必须要有政治意义，要通俗易懂，以便通过这一活动来进行爱国主义思想教育，鼓舞农民的政治热情，给明年生产打下良好基础；二、坚决响应毛主席关于增产节约的号召，防止铺张浪费。最近部分地区已经有铺张浪费现象发生。如河南省确山县二区竹沟镇的农村剧团已经卖了一千多斤粮食，拿卖得的钱买缎子衣服、帽子、胡子、大刀等；四区高庄乡花不少钱买了九个汽灯；王楼乡用一千五百多斤小麦请一个教师
    （旧艺人）教戏。甚至还有个别乡、村干部强迫群众捐钱买文娱用品，引起了群众的不满。这都是应当严加注意和防止的。    段世宇
