    Heavy Waste in Construction by the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau Engineering Section
    To the Editor: The Beijing Railway Sub-bureau Engineering Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration has incurred substantial waste in its construction projects. For example, due to a lack of prior investigation and planning by leading cadres, they mistakenly believed that the Nanyuan branch line bridge project could be coordinated with the Public Health Bureau's project, resulting in a waste of 100 million yuan. When repairing the Xibianmen line, the responsible cadres of this section also failed to examine the types of locomotives that would be using the line and laid 16 kg rails. Only after completing two kilometers did they realize that this type of rail was not suitable for the MK-type locomotives, and they had to replace them with 32 kg rails, wasting over 600 man-days, equivalent to more than 7 million yuan. The bridge project for the Dongbianmen short connecting line, as well as the Xibianmen line project, both had inaccurate material estimates. As a result, after the projects were completed, large quantities of sand, cement, shovels, etc., were left over, estimated to be another 60 to 70 million yuan wasted. The main reason for this waste is the bureaucratic style of the leading cadres in this section. Whenever they assign tasks, they convene employee representative meetings or foreman meetings, hand down the tasks, and consider it done. They do not carry out specific organizational work or inspection work. The leading cadres of the Engineering Section should correct this bureaucratic style.
                                                                                   Sun Zhonglian

    北京铁路分局工务段在工程建设上有很大浪费
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局北京铁路分局工务段在工程建设上有很大浪费。例如：领导干部因为事前没有调查和计划，误以为南苑支线桥梁工程可以配合公共卫生局的工程，结果浪费了一亿元。修西便门线路时，这个段的负责干部也不考查要通行什么类型的机车，就铺了十六公斤的钢轨。一直到完成两公里以后，才知道这种钢轨不适合ㄇㄎ型机车的行驶，只好改铺三十二公斤的钢轨，浪费了六百多人工，合七百多万元。东便门短联络线的桥梁工程，以及西便门线路工程，在材料方面都估计得不正确，致工程结束后，还剩大批沙土、洋灰、铲子等，估计又浪费了六、七千万元。产生这种浪费的主要原因，是这个段的领导干部有官僚主义作风。他们每逢布置任务时，便召开职工代表会议或工长会议，把任务交代下去，就算完了。他们并没有具体地进行组织工作和检查工作。工务段领导干部应纠正这种官僚主义作风。                孙仲连
