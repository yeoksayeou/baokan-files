    Pingyuan Province Resist America, Aid Korea Branch
    Should Not Hoard Comfort Bags for the Volunteer Army
    Comrade Editor: On December 9th, when I went to the Pingyuan Province Resist America, Aid Korea Branch, I saw a lot of comfort bags for the Volunteer Army piled up in Comrade Fu Jimin's dormitory. These comfort bags have been piled up since August until now, and nothing has been covered on them, as if no one has cared about them at all. I asked Comrade Fu Jimin: Why not send them to the Korean front line immediately? He said: There are too many at the front line already, and it would require a lot of freight to transport these things to the front line.
    I think this statement is incorrect. The comfort bags sent by the masses to the Volunteer Army are not only material support, but each comfort bag represents the sender's love for the Volunteer Army. It is wrong to hoard these comfort bags for a long time. I hope the relevant departments will pay attention to this and handle it quickly.　Li Yiping

### 平原省抗美援朝分会  不应积压给志愿军的慰问袋

    平原省抗美援朝分会
    不应积压给志愿军的慰问袋
    编辑同志：十二月九日我到平原省抗美援朝分会时，看到傅济民同志的宿舍里，堆了很多群众送给志愿军的慰问袋。这些慰问袋，从八月份一直堆到现在，上面什么也没有盖，好像根本没有人管过。我问傅济民同志：为什么不把它马上送到朝鲜前线去？他说：前线已经太多了，把这些东西运到前线需要很多运费。
    我以为，这种说法是不正确的。群众送给志愿军的慰问袋，不只是物质上的支援，而且每一个慰问袋，都代表着赠送者对于志愿军的热爱。这样把慰问袋长期堆积下来，是不应该的。希望有关部门引起注意，迅速处理。　李逸萍
