    After two years of recovery, our country's agricultural production has, in most areas, approached the pre-war production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan; in some areas, it has exceeded or greatly exceeded this level; only in a small number of areas that have suffered from continuous disasters and those severely damaged during the war will continued efforts be needed to restore this level. This means that the recovery phase of our country's agricultural production is about to pass, and a new development phase is about to begin. For the past two years, we have mobilized and organized all forces on the agricultural production front with the slogan "Restore pre-war production levels." In 1952, for the country as a whole, although the focus will still be on recovery, some areas have already begun to develop, and most areas will develop during recovery. In the new situation, the policy for continuing to develop agricultural production should be to concentrate efforts on increasing unit area yield.
    In the old liberated areas that have already recovered to or exceeded pre-war agricultural production levels, farmers are no longer satisfied with the current production situation; they demand to break through pre-war production levels and expand reproduction. Farmers in the newly liberated areas who have completed land reform will soon have the same demands. Because our country has a large population and the currently cultivated land area is not large, each agricultural person has an average of only three or four mu of land, so labor is generally surplus. According to surveys in Changzhi, Shanxi, under the current labor technology, a full laborer can cultivate fifteen mu of land, but the actual land available averages only about six mu. How to utilize a large number of surplus laborers to increase production is a problem that must be solved. Current industry and transportation businesses cannot accommodate too many people for the time being; reclaiming wasteland to expand cultivated land area is one way to increase production. In our country's border areas, there are still large areas of wasteland that can and must be reclaimed. However, immigration and land reclamation are not easy to organize on a large scale at present; as for the few mountain wastelands and steep slopes in mountainous areas, they must be forbidden to be cultivated. Therefore, guiding farmers to focus on increasing unit area yield has become the central issue of current agricultural production.
    Increasing unit area yield is entirely possible. Our country's agricultural production has great potential, and after land reform, the vast number of farmers will and have already begun to unleash this potential. Increasing unit area yield can currently be achieved by farmers using production technologies they are already familiar with, such as deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and increasing fertilizer application. If production technology is further improved, yields will increase even more. If dry land is transformed into paddy fields, yields can be increased by one or even several times, and selecting superior varieties can increase yields by 10% to 15%. Comprehensively improving all production technologies will further increase yields. Under the leadership of our Party and the People's Government, giving farmers strong guidance and support politically, economically, and technically will undoubtedly more effectively promote the release of agricultural production potential and greatly increase unit area yield.
    In the production campaigns of the past few years, especially in this year's patriotic bumper harvest campaign, tens of thousands of bumper harvest models have emerged. They have created unprecedented new records in Chinese agricultural history. Their unit area yields have exceeded pre-war yields by four, five, or even ten times or more. Many vivid bumper harvest examples have developed from one household or group to one village, and have even spread to several villages or a region. This fully demonstrates the possibility of increasing unit area yield and points out the direction for increasing production to farmers across the country, setting a good example.
    However, our existing bumper harvest records are not "production to the limit." Agricultural productivity will continue to develop. The advanced agriculture of the Soviet Union has fully confirmed this. In 1950, the highest yields per mu in the Soviet Union were: cotton at 1889 jin, wheat at 1350 jin, corn at 2818 jin, and rice at 1975 jin, all exceeding the average yield from 1909 to 1913 before the October Revolution by thirteen to twenty times or more. This exceeds our country's highest bumper harvest records by a great deal, in some cases by more than double. These undeniable facts show that increasing unit area yield has a bright future.
    Of course, the Soviet Union's unit area yields are produced under mechanized and collectivized production conditions, but this does not mean that unit area yields cannot be increased further under our current production conditions. Many of our bumper harvest models have achieved outstanding bumper harvest results not because they have particularly superior production conditions. Take cotton bumper harvest expert Qu Yaoli as an example. His family has a total of fourteen people and cultivates more than sixty mu of land, with only two main laborers, and the rest are women and children; his bumper harvest cotton field is medium-fertile loamy soil with slight alkalinity, and the well water for irrigation is also bitter water. It can be seen that his labor force and production conditions are not superior to those of ordinary people, and even Qu Yaoli himself has never achieved such high yields in the past. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan and during the period of enemy and puppet rule, his annual yield was 270 to 330 jin per mu, and the highest year only reached 400 jin. The reason why he was able to create such outstanding bumper harvest results of 745 jin of seed cotton per mu last year and 912 jin of seed cotton per mu this year is because he responded to the call of the Party and the People's Government, organized mutual aid groups, improved labor efficiency, ensured timely cultivation, and carried out a series of production technology improvements from tillage, moisture conservation, and rational fertilization to continuous seed selection, close planting, pruning, rational irrigation, and prevention and control of pests and diseases. The farming methods he created in long-term exploration conform to scientific principles, and various yield-increasing factors are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, resulting in a cumulative yield-increasing effect. Take Liu Changwen, a model of rice bumper harvest in the Bohai area, as another example: this year, he achieved a high yield of 1400 jin of rice per mu, but farmers in the local area and his with the same soil, water conservancy, and labor conditions generally have a yield of only about 500 jin. His own yields in the past years have also been no different from everyone else's. From this, we can draw the conclusion: since the production conditions of Qu Yaoli, Liu Changwen, etc., are not better than those of ordinary people; since the yields of Qu Yaoli and Liu Changwen were also the same as those of ordinary people before comprehensively improving farming techniques, it is certain that the typical experience of these bumper harvests can and should be promoted. They can achieve high yields, and everyone can naturally achieve high yields. The key to the problem lies in learning from their bumper harvest experience.
    Seriously summarizing and promoting the typical experience of bumper harvests is the basic link in increasing unit area yield. Summarizing the existing bumper harvest experience, we believe that to increase unit area yield, we must lead and help farmers carry out the following work.
    1.  Increase the accumulation and application of fertilizer. As the saying goes, "With plenty of manure and diligent watering, you don't need to ask anyone." The experience of all bumper harvest models has also proved that increasing fertilizer application is the primary condition for increasing yield. For this reason, on the one hand, state-owned trade departments and cooperatives should supply farmers with bean cake, sesame cake, and chemical fertilizers to the extent possible; on the other hand, and most importantly, we must mobilize farmers to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. It is necessary to increase and breed livestock, promote pig and sheep raising, accumulate a lot of manure, and make good use of human waste and urine. According to local conditions, promote the planting of green manure and the pressing of green manure into the soil, using all possible methods to increase fertilizer.
    2.  Solve the problem of agricultural implements and livestock, and implement deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. In addition to continuing to restore old agricultural implements, new agricultural implements, especially new-style walking plows and cultivators, should be vigorously supplied to farmers. Each major administrative region and province should, to the extent possible, establish new agricultural implement manufacturing plants. Special districts and larger counties should focus on establishing agricultural implement repair plants, and increase draught animals and prevent and control animal epidemics to ensure deep plowing and increase production.
    3.  Build water conservancy projects and fight against water and drought disasters. It is necessary to widely open ditches, dig wells, chisel springs, build small reservoirs, promote waterwheels and pulleys and other water-drawing tools, and strengthen irrigation management to expand the irrigated area. It is necessary to promote autumn plowing and winter plowing, pay attention to soil moisture conservation, implement autumn water storage and winter irrigation, and conserve water. Widely spread the various drought prevention and flood resistance experiences of the masses to overcome water and drought disasters.
    4.  Actively prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, and continue to implement the policy of "prevention is more important than cure." Methods such as warm water seed soaking, seed dressing with pesticides, aphid control, locust control, and rice borer control should be vigorously promoted and popularized. For underground pests that are still difficult to completely eliminate, their damage should be reduced year by year. For yellow rust, rice gall midge, and other pests, effective prevention and control methods should continue to be studied. Fully prepare insecticides and equipment (sprayers, cotton oil soap, 666, etc.), and train village cadres, labor models, and mutual aid group leaders to widely disseminate control methods and prevention and control experience to the masses.
    5.  Carry out a seed selection campaign and promote superior varieties. Encourage every household to select seeds and keep seeds, and universally mobilize the masses to carry out field ear selection to cultivate the masses' habit of selecting and keeping seeds. Complete the evaluation work on a county basis in a planned and step-by-step manner to realize the plan for popularizing improved varieties. Mutual aid groups and production cooperatives should delineate small plots of land as improved seed trial plots, continuously select seeds, breed seeds, continuously propagate and promote them, and continue to strive to discover high-quality and high-yielding superior seeds. Newly promoted improved varieties must undergo cultivation trials to overcome the phenomenon of blind promotion and large-scale long-distance transfer.
    The Party and the People's Government must strengthen the technical leadership of agricultural production, and each province, special district, and county should directly run a farm well. Technical research associations, technical groups, etc., that have been established in rural areas should be strengthened in leadership and vigorously promoted, in order to promote the spirit of mass research and creation, and under the premise of patriotism, set off a high tide of improving production technology in rural areas.
    Organizing is the basic way to develop rural productive forces. Cooperation and mutual assistance are far superior to individual farming, and it can effectively overcome the many weaknesses that exist in individual and decentralized small-scale agricultural production. The yields of long-term stable mutual aid groups have all increased significantly. In the future, mutual aid groups must be developed in large numbers under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit; temporary seasonal labor mutual aid groups should be guided to develop into long-term stable mutual aid groups in a planned way; agricultural production cooperatives should be appropriately promoted under the conditions of complete voluntariness, mutual benefit, and active elements as the backbone. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions and organize most farmers into agricultural production cooperative mutual aid groups within a few years and make it a habit, then production efficiency will be strengthened and the unit area yield will be greatly increased.
    All areas that have completed land reform should convene labor model representative conferences this winter as much as possible to implement the policy of organizing, promote bumper harvest experience, and seriously reward bumper harvest experts. Launch extensive publicity, clear the minds of farmers and cadres, and break down some conservative ideas among them. Under the education of patriotism, coordinate with the work of surveying fields and determining production to improve farmers' enthusiasm for production. At the same time, make all preparations for next year's bumper harvest this winter, mobilize the bumper harvest competition of millions of mutual aid group model villages, promote revolutionary heroism, set off a vigorous patriotic production increase movement, and under the general policy of increasing unit area yield, strive for a greater bumper harvest next year.

### 提高单位面积产量，争取一九五二年的丰收

    提高单位面积产量，争取一九五二年的丰收
    我们国家的农业生产，经过两年来的恢复工作，在大部地区已经接近于抗日战争以前的生产水平；在一部分地区已经超过或大大超过了这个水平；只有在一小部分连年遭灾地区和战争中破坏严重的地区，还需要继续努力，才能恢复到这个水平。这就是说，我们国家的农业生产的恢复阶段即将过去，而新的发展阶段就要到来。两年来，我们曾以“恢复战前生产水平”的口号，动员和组织了农业生产战线上的一切力量。一九五二年，就全国范围来说，虽然仍以恢复为主，但是部分地区已走向发展，大部分地区要在恢复中发展。在新的情况下，继续发展农业生产的方针，应该是集中力量，力求提高单位面积产量。
    在已经恢复到或超过了战前农业生产水平的老解放区，农民已经不满足于目前的生产状况，他们要求突破战前的生产水平，要求扩大再生产。已经完成土地改革的新区农民，也将很快会有同样的要求。由于我国人口众多，目前已耕的土地面积还不大，每一农业人口平均只有三、四亩地，所以，劳动力一般是有敷余的。据山西长治一带调查，按照目前的劳动技术，一个全劳动力可以种地十五亩，但实有土地平均只有六亩左右。如何利用大批剩余劳动力来增加生产，这是必须解决的问题。目前的工业和交通事业，暂时还不可能容纳太多的人；开荒扩大耕地面积，是增加生产的一个方法，在我国边疆，还有大片荒地，可以而且必须开垦，但是，移民垦荒等在目前还不容易大规模举办；至于山区仅有的一些山荒陡坡，则是必须禁垦的。因此，引导农民致力于提高单位面积产量，就成为目前农业生产的中心问题了。
    提高单位面积产量是完全可能的。我国农业生产的潜在力还很大，土地改革以后，广大农民就会而且已经开始把这些潜力发挥出来。提高单位面积产量，在目前，是农民用他们已经熟悉的生产技术，如深耕、细作、增加肥料等，就能达到的。如果对生产技术再加改进，则产量更会提高。如果把旱地变为水田，可以提高产量一倍乃至数倍，选用优良品种，可以提高产量百分之十到百分之十五。把各项生产技术全盘加以改进，则产量将更增加。在我们的党和人民政府的领导下，从政策上、经济上和技术上，用大力对农民加以指导和扶植，今后无疑将会更有力地促使农业生产的潜在力发挥出来，使单位面积产量大大提高。
    在几年来的生产运动，特别是今年的爱国主义丰产运动中，已经出现了成千成万的丰产模范。他们已创造了在中国农业史上空前的新纪录。他们的单位面积产量已经超过战前产量的四、五倍以至十倍以上。许多生动的丰产事例，从一户、一组发展到
    一村，甚至已经发展到几个村或一个地区。这充分说明了提高单位面积产量的可能性，并且给全国农民指明了增产的方向，做出了良好的榜样。
    但是，我们已有的丰产纪录，也并不是“生产到顶”的产量。农业生产力还会继续发展。苏联的先进农业已经充分地证实了这一点。一九五○年，苏联每亩地的最高产量是：棉花产一八八九斤，小麦产一三五○斤，玉蜀黍产二八一八斤，水稻产一九七五斤，都超过了十月革命前一九○九年到一九一三年平均产量的十三倍到二十倍以上。这又比我国的最高丰产纪录超过许多，有的超过一倍以上。这些不可否认的事实，说明提高单位面积产量是有远大前途的。
    当然，苏联的单位面积产量是在机械化和集体化的生产条件下产生的，但这决不是说，在我们目前的生产条件下，单位面积产量就不能再提高了。我们的许多丰产模范，所以创造了突出的丰产成绩，并不是由于他们独具了特殊优越的生产条件。以棉花丰产能手曲耀离为例，他家中共有十四口人，种着六十多亩地，只有两个主要劳动力，其余人口都是妇女和小孩；他的丰产棉田是中等肥度带轻碱性的壤土，浇地的井水又是苦水，可见他的劳动力和生产条件并不比一般人优越，而且就是曲耀离本人，在过去从来也没有获得过这样高的产量。在抗日战争以前和在敌伪统治时期，他的常年产量每亩是二百七十斤到三百三十斤，最高的一年才达到四百斤。他所以能够在去年创造了每亩七百四十五斤籽棉、在今年又创造出每亩九百十二斤籽棉这样突出的丰产成绩，是由于他响应了党和人民政府的号召，组织了互助组，提高了劳动效率，保证了及时耕作，并且从耕地、保墒、合理施肥，到连续选种、密植、整枝、合理灌溉、防除虫害等进行了一系列的生产技术的改进。他在长期摸索中创造的耕作方法，符合于科学原理，各项增产因素相依相成，因此获得了累进增产的效果。再以渤海区水稻丰产模范刘长文为例：他今年每亩水稻获得一千四百斤的高额产量，但是当地和他的土壤、水利、劳力等条件相同的农民，一般产量却只有五百斤左右。他自己过去历年的产量，也和大家没有差别。从这里我们就可以得出结论：既然曲耀离、刘长文等的生产条件并不比一般人好；既然曲耀离、刘长文在没有全面改进耕作技术以前，产量也和一般人相同，那么，肯定地说，这些丰产典型经验是可以而且应该推广的。他们能够获得高额产量，大家自然也都可以获得高额产量，问题的关键，就在于学习他们的丰产经验。
    认真地总结和推广丰产典型经验，是提高单位面积产量的基本环节。综合现有的丰产经验，我们认为要提高单位面积产量，必须领导和帮助农民进行以下工作。
    一、增积和施用肥料。农谚说：“粪大水勤，不用问人。”所有丰产典型的经验也都证明：增施肥料是增加产量的首要条件。为此，一方面国营贸易部门和合作社，应在可能条件下供应农民以豆饼、麻饼和化学肥料；另方面，也是最主要的方面，我们要发动农民，大量增积肥料。要增加和繁殖牲畜，提倡养猪养羊，多积圈肥，很好地积存和利用人粪人尿，并根据各地条件提倡种绿肥、压绿肥，用一切可能的方法来增加肥料。
    二、解决农具牲畜问题，实行深耕细作。除继续恢复旧农具外，应大力供应农民新式农具，尤其是新式步犁和中耕器。各大行政区和省，应在可能条件下，建立新农具制造厂，专署和较大县份，应有重点地建立农具修理厂，并增加耕畜，防治兽疫，以保证深耕，增加产量。
    三、兴修水利，和水旱灾害作斗争。要广泛地开渠、打井、凿泉、修筑小水库、推广水车和辘轳等汲水工具，并加强灌溉管理工作，扩大浇地面积。要提倡秋耕冬耕，注意保墒，实行秋汇冬浇，涵蓄水分。并广泛地传播群众的各种防旱抗涝经验，以战胜水旱灾害。
    四、积极防除病虫害，继续贯彻“防重于治”的方针。温汤浸种、药剂拌种、治蚜虫、治蝗、除螟等办法，要用大力加以推广普及。对于尚难完全消灭的地下害虫，应逐年减轻其为害程度。对于黄锈病、吸浆虫害等，应继续研究有效的防治办法。充分准备杀虫药械（喷雾器、棉油皂、六六六等），并训练村干部、劳动模范、互助组长，向群众广泛传播除治办法和防治经验。
    五、开展选种运动，推广优良品种。提倡家家选种，户户留种，普遍发动群众实行田间穗选，以养成群众选种、留种习惯，有计划、有步骤地完成以县为单位的评选工作，实现良种普及计划。互助组、生产合作社应划出小块土地做为良种试验地，连续选种、育种，连续繁殖和推广，继续努力发现品质高产量多的优良种子。新推广的良种，一定要经过栽培试验，克服盲目推广和远程大量调剂的现象。
    党和人民政府必须加强对农业生产的技术领导，各省、各专区、各县都应直接办好一个农场。对于农村中已经建立起来的技术研究会、技术小组等，要加强领导，大力推广，借以发扬群众钻研创造的精神，在爱国主义的前提下，掀起农村中改进生产技术的热潮。
    组织起来是发展农村生产力的基本办法。合作互助比之单干要优越的多，它能有效地克服个体分散的小农生产所存在着的许多弱点。凡长期定型的互助组，其产量都有显著提高。今后必须在自愿互利的原则下，大量发展互助组；有计划地引导临时的季节性的劳动互助组发展成为长期定型的互助组；在完全自愿两利并有积极分子做骨干的条件下，适当地提倡农业生产合作社。只要我们按照毛主席的指示，在几年之内使大多数农民都组织在农业生产的合作互助组里面，并且成为习惯，那么，生产效能就会加强，单位面积产量就会大大提高。
    一切完成了土地改革的地区，今年冬季都要尽可能地召开劳动模范代表会议，贯彻组织起来的方针，推广丰产经验，认真奖励丰产能手。展开广泛的宣传，打通农民和干部的思想，打破他们中间的某些保守思想。在爱国主义的教育下，配合查田定产工作，提高农民的生产积极性。同时要在今冬作好明年丰产的一切准备工作，发动起千百万互助组模范村的丰产竞赛，发扬革命的英雄主义，掀起轰轰烈烈的爱国增产运动，在普遍提高单位面积产量的方针下，争取明年更大的丰收。
