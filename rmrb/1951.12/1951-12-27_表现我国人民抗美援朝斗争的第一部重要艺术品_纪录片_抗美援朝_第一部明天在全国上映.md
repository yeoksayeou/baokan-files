Xinhua News Agency, December 26th -- The first part of the documentary film "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea," recently produced by the Beijing Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau, will be screened in forty-four large cities across the country, as well as in factories, military units, and rural areas, starting on December 28th.

This film, collaboratively shot by Xu Xiaobing and thirteen other photographers who followed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, is the first important artwork reflecting the Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The film vividly narrates the close relationship between China and North Korea, the liberation of the people of northern Korea with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the main experiences of the U.S. imperialists instigating their running dogs to launch an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the various moving scenes of the Korean people and the Chinese people fighting side by side against the invaders and achieving victory.

"Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea" is a major success in the history of Chinese documentary films. This is not only because of the greatness of its subject matter, but also because of its artistic excellence. The production of this film is the result of the heroic struggle on the battlefield by its director, screenwriter, and photographer, Stalin Prize winner Xu Xiaobing, and all other war correspondents. One of the photographers, Yang Xuzhong, sacrificed his life in the line of duty. The explanatory text written by the poet Ai Qing for the film is beautiful and passionate, and worthy of the struggle depicted in the film.

    表现我国人民抗美援朝斗争的第一部重要艺术品
    纪录片“抗美援朝”第一部明天在全国上映
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央电影局北京电影制片厂最近出品的文献纪录影片“抗美援朝”第一部，即将于本月二十八日在全国四十四个大城市及工厂、部队、农村中放映。
    该片为随中国人民志愿军摄影师徐肖冰等十三人合作摄制，是表现中国人民抗美援朝斗争的第一部重要艺术品。影片生动地叙述了中朝两国唇齿相依的关系，叙述了朝鲜北部人民在苏联红军的援助下得到解放和美帝国主义指使其走狗发动对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻的主要经历，叙述了朝鲜人民和中国人民对侵略者并肩作战并取得胜利的各种动人的场景。
    “抗美援朝”在中国纪录影片的历史上是一个重大的成功。这不但是因为它的题材的伟大，也因为它的艺术上的优异。该片的制作是它的编导兼摄影者、斯大林奖金获得者徐肖冰和其他所有战地摄影人员在战场上英勇奋斗的结果。摄影师之一杨序忠在工作中献出了生命。诗人艾青为该片所写的说明词优美而热烈，与片中所表现的斗争也可以相称。
