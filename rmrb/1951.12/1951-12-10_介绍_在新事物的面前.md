Introducing "In the Face of New Things"
By our reporter, Zǐ Gāng

The four-act play "In the Face of New Things," written by Dù Yìn, Liú Xiàngrú, and Hú Líng, has been performed in some cities. This time, after several months of experiencing life in factories, the comrades of the China Youth Art Theater earnestly performed this play in the capital.

In the two or three years after liberation, many plays reflecting revolutionary struggles, exposing the dark rule of the old society, and praising new people and new things in the new society appeared on the Beijing stage. Some Soviet translated scripts were also performed, but the play that we have been anticipating, which positively reflects our country's industrial construction, has only appeared now, which cannot but bring a new atmosphere to the Beijing stage.

Xué Zhìgāng, the manager of the Third Steel Company in the play, although he only attended elementary school for four years, is an excellent Communist Party member from a printing worker background who has been tempered for a long time. He is not afraid of any difficulties, has a tireless spirit of research in his work, and is good at grasping the regularity of the development of objective things to achieve victory in his work. In the early days of the Northeast industrial recovery in 1949, Xue Zhigang collected and studied books on economic construction, paying particular attention to absorbing the Soviet Union's experience in this area. He took out a bullet that had been lodged in his body for four or five years during the War of Resistance Against Japan in the hospital; his health was not good enough, but in order to prepare for participating in industrial construction in the future, he used even his rest time to study. At this time, he not only studied books on economic construction thoroughly, but also actively learned Russian. When he was assigned to the Third Steel Company, he overcame difficulties in the construction project with high political enthusiasm, using scientific thinking methods and working methods, and increased the production plan, so that iron production exceeded the 300 tons per day during the puppet Manchukuo period. This play also vividly illustrates the process of economic recovery and development in Northeast China. The audience can feel a lot of new things from this play:

First: The play focuses on promoting the leading role of the working class. After the workers became the masters of the country, what they showed in the Third Steel Company was not just handing over many valuable equipment, turning scrap piles around; but also their wisdom and enthusiasm were fully utilized, and the face of the company was renewed, so that the chief engineer Gù Chénglín kept shouting "miracle". Here, the superiority of the New Democracy system has been fully demonstrated.

Second, the play also tells us that to do a good job in industrial production, we must strengthen the unity of workers and technical experts. An old worker pondered in the factory for thirty-two years and drew the drawings that should have been drawn by the construction engineer. Although he did not calculate the "expansion coefficient" of the iron-making furnace hearth, he drew it very practically, which made the chief engineer praise him. It is precisely because Xue Zhigang correctly implemented the policy of relying on the working class and uniting technical personnel that he can overcome difficulties and successfully complete production tasks. This illustrates the importance of unity within the working class and the necessity of mutual respect and mutual learning between workers and technical personnel.

Third, the play also makes us realize that the steel industry is a joint large-scale industry. Not only can steel not be made without coke ovens, but it is also difficult to move if a machine is missing a part. This is indeed one aspect of the problem; however, this is ultimately a technical issue; but Deputy Manager Gāo Quán regards this as the main problem, but Xue Zhigang's view is different. He believes that the key is to unite technical personnel on the basis of mobilizing the masses of workers, thereby solving key problems.

This play sharply raises a ideological problem, which is the contrast and conflict between a positive and enterprising ideological style and a conservative empiricist ideological style. The former will definitely win, and will definitely always maintain ideological youth, a keen sense of new things, and great interest, so new miracles will be created. As for those who stubbornly stick to empiricism, they will decay, be more than losers, and unable to accomplish increasingly important tasks, even though they want to be responsible to the country and are conscientious. And strictly speaking, the problems committed by people like Gao Quan are not limited to empiricism. His blind respect for the authority and ability of Chief Engineer Gu and his refusal to listen to the opinions of experienced workers and Engineer Zhao are also the result of petty-bourgeois and bourgeois thoughts at work.

The whole play is permeated with the revolutionary spirit of optimism. The audience follows the activities of the Communist Party cadres, technical personnel, and worker masses in the play to accept new things, and follows Xue Zhigang's spirit of research to care about the large-scale industry in Northeast China and the construction plan of the Third Steel Company. When they hear that the No. 4 coke oven can be repaired and used, the audience feels like they have won a battle in their own work. And when the coking fails again and again, and the workers carry trays of coke powder on stage, how disappointed the audience is. After that, everyone learns Xue Zhigang's spirit of getting to the root of the problem. Finally, the workers carry out good coke covered with red paper cutouts, and they sincerely give gifts to the factory leaders - three copper-cast small iron-making furnaces, and the workers of each department express their determination. The iron-making plant construction team also studied some of the Soviet Union's experience in rushing to repair iron-making furnaces during the war, and planned to repair the third iron-making furnace within that year.

When the characters of the Third Steel Company on stage raise their glasses to wish for the victory of China's new industry, the audience is filled with the revolutionary spirit of optimism. People are not watching a play, but taking a lesson that is just right for the problem. Everyone encounters some new things, big and small, every day. How should we treat them? How should we study all new things? People feel more and more closely the happiness of living in the Mao Zedong era and the solemn and great historical mission.

There is no villain in this play, but it solemnly criticizes the diligent clerical workers of the type of Deputy Manager Gao Quan, whose style is to emphasize "centralized unity," so much so that even the list of cadres requesting milk must be approved by him. He is afraid of taking responsibility. The play describes in detail the process of educating him, persuading him, and convincing him with facts, so that the audience also loves him, regrets his mediocrity, and is especially happy to see his awakening.

"In the Face of New Things" is a beneficial play. The reason why it has achieved such good performance results is undoubtedly inseparable from the repeated tempering of the script and the actors' in-depth experience of life. The shortcomings of the performance have been mentioned in Comrade Liao Chengzhi's article (see the third page of the China Youth Daily on the 7th of this month), which will not be repeated here.

### 介绍“在新事物的面前”

    介绍“在新事物的面前”
    本报记者  子冈
    由杜印、刘相如、胡零合写的四幕话剧“在新事物的面前”曾经在一些城市中上演过。这次中国青年艺术剧院的同志们经过几个月的下厂体验生活，认真地把这个戏在首都演出了。
    在解放后的二三年中，北京的话剧舞台上出现过不少以反映革命斗争、暴露旧社会黑暗统治和表扬新社会新人新事为题材的戏，也演过一些苏联的翻译剧本，但是我们所企盼着正面反映我国工业建设的戏，一直到现在才出现，这不能不给北京的话剧舞台带来一种新的气象。
    剧中第三钢铁公司经理薛志钢，虽然只读过四年小学，但他是印刷工人出身、久经锻炼的优秀的共产党员。他不怕任何困难，对业务有不知疲倦的钻研精神，善于掌握客观事物发展的规律性，来取得工作的胜利。在一九四九年东北工业恢复初期，薛志钢就搜集并研读经济建设的书籍，尤其注意吸取苏联在这方面的经验。他在医院里从身上取出一颗四五年前抗日战争中打进去的子弹，身体是不够健康的；但他为了准备今后参加工业建设的条件，他连休养的时间也用在学习上了。这时他不只熟读经济建设的书籍，而且还积极学习俄文。当他被派到第三钢铁公司的时候，他以高度的政治热情，运用科学的思想方法、工作方法，克服了修建工程中的困难，提高了生产计划，使铁的生产超过了伪满时期每天三百吨的产量。这个剧本也形象地说明了东北经济恢复发展的过程。观众是能从这个剧里感受到不少的新鲜东西的：
    第一：剧本着重宣传了工人阶级的领导作用。工人作了国家的主人翁以后，在第三钢铁公司所表现的，不只是把许多贵重器材献交出来，使废铁堆翻了身；而且他们的智慧和积极性也得到充分的发挥，公司的面貌为之一新，以致总工程师顾成林一连喊叫“奇迹”。在这里，新民主主义制度的优越性得到了充分的证明。
    第二，剧本也告诉我们，要搞好工业生产，必须加强工人和技术专家的团结。老工人在厂子里琢磨了三十二年，画出了应该是修建工程师画的图纸，虽然他没有算入炼铁炉炉缸的“膨胀系数”，但是他画得很实际，使得总工程师也赞美不已。薛志钢正是由于正确地执行了依靠工人阶级、团结技术人员的政策，才能克服困难，胜利地完成生产任务。这里说明了工人阶级内部团结的重要性，工人和技术人员互相尊重，互相学习的必要。
    第三，剧本也使我们认识了钢铁工业是一个联合性的大工业，不独没有炼焦炉炼不了钢，就是机器缺少一个零件也难动弹。这的确是问题的一个方面，不过，这总归是技术方面的问题；但副经理高泉却把这看作是主要问题，薛志钢的看法却不一样，他认为关键是在发动工人群众的基础上，团结技术人员，从而解决关键问题。
    这个戏尖锐地提出一个思想问题，就是一种积极进取的思想作风和一种保守的经验主义的思想作风的对比和冲突，前者一定获得胜利，也一定永远保持思想上的年青、对新鲜事物敏锐的感觉和极大的兴味，因此新的奇迹就会被创造出来。而死抱住经验主义不放的人呢，他们会腐朽下去，成事不足，败事有余，他们想对国家负责，兢兢业业，事实上是不能完成愈来愈重大的工作任务的。而且严格分析起来，高泉一类人物所犯的毛病还不止于经验主义，他之盲目尊重顾总工程师的权威和能力，不肯听取有经验的工人和赵工程师的意见，也是小资产阶级的、资产阶级的思想在作祟。
    全剧里贯穿着乐观主义的革命精神，观众们随了剧中的共产党的干部、技术人员和工人群众的活动接受着新事物，随了薛志钢的钻研精神而关心东北的大工业，关心第三钢铁公司的修建计划。当听到四号炼焦炉可以修复使用的时候，观众们就像是在自己工作中打了一个胜仗。而一次次炼焦失败，工人们托了一盘盘焦粉上场的时候，观众们又是多么失望，之后，大家又学习了薛志钢的摸根精神，最后工人们托着覆盖了红纸剪花的好焦子出来了，而且他们诚心地给工厂的领导方面送礼——三座铜铸的小炼铁炉，并且各部门的工人表示了他们的决心，炼铁厂修建队还学习了苏联在战争时期抢修炼铁炉的一些经验，打算在那一年年内修复第三座炼铁炉。
    当台上的第三钢铁公司的人物们举杯预祝中国新工业的胜利的时候，观众们充满了革命的乐观主义的精神。人们不是在看戏，而是上了对症下药的一课。每个人每天都遇到些大大小小的新事物，如何对待它们呢？如何钻研一切新事物呢？人们愈加亲切地感觉到生活在毛泽东时代的幸福和庄严伟大的历史任务。
    这个戏里没有一个反派人物，只是郑重地批评了高泉副经理这一类型人的辛辛勤勤的事务主义者，他的作风是强调“集中统一”，甚至于干部要求牛奶的名单，也要经过他批准。他畏首畏尾地怕负责任。剧本里对教育他、劝说他、以及由事实说服他的过程是很仔细地描写了的，让观众们也爱他，为他的庸庸碌碌惋惜，尤其高兴看到他的觉悟。
    “在新事物的面前”是一个有益的戏，它所以得到这样好的演出效果，无疑地和剧本的经过多次的锤炼和演员同志们的深入体验生活是分不开的。演出的缺点在廖承志同志一文（见本月七日中国青年报第三版）中已涉及，这儿不重复了。
