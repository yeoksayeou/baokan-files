    Baoding No. 1 Middle School Embezzler,
    Dai Hongzhen, Detained by People's Court
    Editor: Dai Hongzhen is the food administrator of Baoding No. 1 Middle School. In the past year, he embezzled over 14 million yuan of the students' food expenses. Due to his embezzlement, the students' health has been greatly damaged.

    Since Dai Hongzhen took over the food service, the food has been very poor, and the students often do not have enough to eat, which has aroused suspicion among some students. However, the school leaders blindly trusted him because he came from the old liberated areas. At the end of last semester, according to the accounts submitted by Dai Hongzhen, the surplus was only over 320,000 yuan. His accounts were false, the income and expenditure did not match, and they were arbitrarily altered, which everyone could not believe. Therefore, the school leaders decided to investigate the accounts for the first half of this year. During the inspection, his embezzlement was discovered. Dai Hongzhen has now been detained by the Baoding Municipal People's Court.

    I believe that Dai Hongzhen should be severely punished. At the same time, I believe that the teachers and students in our school should wage a resolute struggle against embezzlers.

    保定市一中贪污分子
    戴鸿振被人民法院拘押
    编辑同志：戴鸿振是保定市第一中学的伙食管理员，他在过去一年中，贪污学生的伙食费一千四百多万元。由于他的贪污，同学们的健康受到了很大的损害。
    我校自戴鸿振接管伙食工作以来，伙食办得很坏，同学们常有吃不饱的情形，因此引起了一部分同学对他的怀疑。但学校领导方面却认为他是从老解放区来的，因而盲目信任。上学期结束时，据戴鸿振交出的账目，节余只有三十二万多元。他的账目是假的，收支不符，随便涂改，大家不能相信，因此，学校领导方面决定清查今年上半年的账目。在检查中，发现了他的贪污行为。现在戴鸿振已被保定市人民法院扣押。
    我认为戴鸿振应该受到严厉的制裁，同时，我认为我们学校中的老师和同学应该和贪污分子进行坚决的斗争。保定市第一中学学生  徐木
