    Blindly Organising Disaster Victims to Work Elsewhere Causes Serious Waste
    Editor: Recently, in order to solve the livelihood difficulties of disaster victims, Longguan, Yanggao, Zhangbei, and other counties in Chahar Province successively organized 2,375 disaster victims to work in Mentougou. Organizing disaster victims to work elsewhere is a good thing in itself. However, because the higher-level cadres lacked planning and publicity when assigning this task, the lower-level cadres developed a purely task-oriented viewpoint and a commandist style of work. For example, Xu Wanrui, the Secretary of the Longguan County Second District Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to complete the task, insisted on "making up the numbers" by sending three sick disaster victims (one with an eye ailment, one with a backache, and one with asthma). As a result, they were "introduced" back after arriving in Mentougou. In Mazhan'an Yingzi, Sixth District of Shangyi County, the disaster was relatively light, with four or five years' worth of harvest, and life was not difficult, but eighteen people were mobilized to go, and eight of them returned the same day. A disaster victim in Deyuan Village, Second District, brought 800,000 yuan and took advantage of the work opportunity to transport and sell goods before running back. Some counties and districts said when mobilizing disaster victims, that those who had enough to eat did not have to go, and those who did not have enough to eat had to go regardless of age, weakness, illness, or disability; Yanggao, Chongli, and other counties also deceived disaster victims during mobilization, saying, "There is all kinds of work there, if you can't carry coal, you can do something else," or saying that they would only go to Xiahuayuan and not Mentougou. As a result, many of the disaster victims who went were ran back. As of November 19, statistics from Zhangbei, Yanggao, Shangyi, and Guyuan counties alone showed that 549 people had returned home from Mentougou, with those returning from Yanggao and Zhangbei counties accounting for almost 40% of those who went. Calculating that it costs at least 100,000 yuan for a round trip from Yanggao or Zhangbei to Mentougou, the 549 people spent 54.9 million yuan on travel expenses, which could provide one month's living expenses for 1,300 disaster victims. In this way, not only was state property wasted, but also the production of the disaster-stricken masses was delayed. It is hoped that the relevant departments will pay attention to correcting this phenomenon.　Wei Zetong

### 察哈尔省龙关阳高等县  盲目组织灾民外出工作造成严重浪费

    察哈尔省龙关阳高等县
    盲目组织灾民外出工作造成严重浪费
    编辑同志：察哈尔省龙关、阳高、张北等县最近为了解决灾民生活困难，曾先后组织了二千三百七十五个灾民到门头沟去做工。组织灾民出外做工，本是一件好事。但由于上级干部布置这一任务时缺乏计划和宣传，下级干部就产生了单纯任务观点和强迫命令作风。如龙关县二区中共区委书记徐万瑞为了完成任务，把三个有病的灾民（一眼痛、一腰痛、一喘病）都硬叫“凑数”去了，结果到门头沟后又被“介绍”了回来。尚义县六区马占鞍营子受灾较轻，有四、五成年景，生活不算困难，但也被动员去了十八人，结果当天就回来了八人；二区德元村一个灾民带了八十万元，借做工机会贩了一趟货又跑回来了。有的县、区动员灾民时说，够吃的不去，不够吃的不分老弱病残都得去；阳高、崇礼等县在动员时还欺骗灾民说：“那里什么活都有，背不了煤可作别的”，或说只去下花园不去门头沟。这样动员去的灾民很多都跑了回来。到十一月十九日止，只张北、阳高、尚义、沽源四县统计，从门头沟回家的已达五百四十九人，其中阳高、张北两县回来的差不多占出去的百分之四十。计算一下，从阳高或张北到门头沟，往返一趟至少需旅费十万元，五百四十九人就花去旅费五千四百九十万元，可供一千三百个灾民一个月的生活费用。这样，不只浪费了国家财产，还耽误了灾民群众生产，希望有关部门注意纠正这种现象。　魏泽同
