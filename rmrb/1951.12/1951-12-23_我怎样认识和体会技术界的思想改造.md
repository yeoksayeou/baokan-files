Some intellectuals who grew up in the old society's technical field believe that those who study technology should focus on technology and not be concerned with politics. Therefore, they do not value ideological remolding and do not actively engage in study. This is obviously wrong. I am a technical worker in the railway department and grew up in the old society, heavily influenced by capitalism and feudalism in my thinking, which led to many mistakes. However, I did not pay attention to or correct these mistakes in the past. Only after liberation, through work and study, did I re-evaluate myself and realize the urgent need for personal ideological remolding. Here, I would like to write down these understandings and experiences, in fragments, for the reference of technical workers.

First is the issue of standpoint. Initially, I did not know what "standpoint" was at all. Later, after reading some documents, I understood the meaning of "standpoint," but then I thought that as long as technical personnel do their technical work well, they are serving the people, and the issue of standpoint can be disregarded. This May, I went to the Southwest to participate in land reform work. Under the leadership of the local work team, I felt hatred for the cruel exploitation by the landlord class and gained a deeper understanding of the peasants' enthusiasm for struggle, their hard work in production, and their wisdom. Most importantly, I initially grasped the correct standpoint. Before participating in the land reform work, I often heard some people talking about how the land reform work in the Southwest had "deviations," was "excessive," and was "a mess." However, during my two months of work in the rural areas of the Southwest, I felt that if one measures the treatment of landlords today by peasants against the past cruelty of landlords' exploitation and oppression of peasants, it can be said that the peasants are too lenient. Therefore, I further realized that the so-called "deviations," "excessiveness," and "a mess" were all broadcast by the landlords' "megaphones." Those who act as voluntary "megaphones" are either connected to the landlords in terms of interests or feelings, or they themselves are from landlord families, sympathizing with the landlords. Therefore, they only see the interests of the landlords and do not see the suffering of the peasants. So, when the landlords' interests are harmed and they clamor everywhere, they consciously or unconsciously clamor for the landlords. From this, we can see that those who stand on the side of the feudal landlord exploiting class will inevitably consciously or unconsciously serve the landlord class; only by standing on the side of the exploited can one recognize the cruelty of the landlord class, sympathize with the suffering of the peasant class, support the peasant movement, and judge what is truly right and wrong. Therefore, all right and wrong must be judged based on standpoint; if the standpoint is not firm, the judgment of right and wrong will be mistaken. After this land reform movement and repeated reflection, I deeply felt that in my decades of work in the technical field, I had no people's standpoint. On the surface, it was purely technical work, but in reality, it was only faithfully serving the reactionary class. All my efforts for decades were essentially working for my own fame and gain, never thinking about what the work had to do with the immediate interests of the broad masses of working people, never thinking about which standpoint I was working from. After this experience and learning, I realized that only by standing on the side of the working class can I correctly establish a worldview of serving the people; if the standpoint is not correct and right and wrong are not clear, then empty talk of serving the people is simply deceiving.

Second is the issue of the mass line. Intellectuals with strong petty-bourgeois consciousness, especially intellectuals in the technical field, have the strongest sense of superiority and are the most arrogant and self-important. They believe that their theories are superior, their creations are better, so they do not humbly learn or humbly accept the opinions of others, and they are detached from the masses. I remember when repairing a railway bridge on the Yuehan Line in the winter of 1949, it was necessary to cut steel beams underwater, but there was no "underwater gas cutter" at the construction site, and I and several engineers were at a loss. Later, at the suggestion of a working comrade, we convened all the staff to discuss solutions, and as a result, a non-engineering staff member came up with the idea of making a waterproof wooden barrel, tightly enclosing the steel beam, and then pumping the water out of the barrel to cut the steel beam with an ordinary gas cutter. This idea solved the problem that the engineers could not solve and enabled the Yuehan Line to be opened to traffic on schedule. This greatly moved me and made me realize that the masses have unlimited wisdom. If we intellectuals in the technical field do not rely on the masses, do not unite with the masses, and are arrogant and self-important, it is impossible to serve the masses. Currently, a nationwide movement to increase production and practice thrift is being launched to accumulate wealth for the country for large-scale construction. We intellectuals in the technical field must be closely united with the working masses to undertake this work.

Third is the issue of method. The method of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is the scientific method of materialist dialectics, which is a method of improving understanding and solving problems through investigation and research from practice. However, the thinking methods of intellectuals who grew up in the old society, at least in part, are detached from reality and based on subjective assumptions. For example, in recent years, many national basic construction projects have been started without proper design, resulting in repeated changes in design and waste of manpower and materials. Is this not because we technical intellectuals have made the mistake of relying on subjective assumptions and being detached from reality? In 1950, when the Ministry of Railways discussed the transportation volume and route standards of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, I only inferred the transportation volume after the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway based on past surveys and with reference to the progress of agriculture, industry, and commerce in various parts of old China. It was not until I participated in land reform this year and saw the development of productivity after the liberation of the countryside, and the development of industry and commerce caused by the increase in peasants' purchasing power, that I began to understand that the transportation volume after the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway could no longer be based on the figures of old China. We must analyze problems based on new facts and new situations; empiricism and dogmatism are both unacceptable. This shows that our technical field's method of thinking must be the dialectics of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and must be a scientific method based on the development of facts, combined with investigation and research for analysis. We can no longer use the old, impractical, subjective methods.

In the two years since liberation, I have combined learning with practical problems in my work. Although I have gained some small insights, I still feel that the gains are not great and the progress is not fast. The times require us technical personnel from the old society to accelerate ideological remolding. To remold our thinking is to remold our old standpoints, change our old views, change our old methods, and firmly stand on the side of the working class to become technical intellectuals of the people. To achieve this goal, we must seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Only by using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly transform and improve ourselves can technical workers combine their technology with the masses, undertake the task of increasing production and practicing thrift, and complete the country's production and construction.

To carry out ideological remolding, we must make good use of the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. Whether we dare to point out the shortcomings in our work and the problems in our thinking, whether we dare to criticize others and be willing to accept the criticism of others, this is a test. Let each of us technical intellectuals earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism, redouble our efforts to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so as to do a good job in the great work of China's industrialization.

    我怎样认识和体会技术界的思想改造
    中央人民政府铁道部设计局局长  林诗伯
    有些从旧社会技术界成长起来的知识分子，认为学技术的人，最好是钻研技术，不必过问政治。因此，他们对思想改造不重视，不积极主动地进行学习。这显然是错误的。我是铁道部门的一个技术工作者，是从旧社会中成长起来的，在思想上受资本主义封建主义的影响很大，因而所犯的错误也很多。但是我过去并不注意，也不纠正这些错误。直到解放后，在工作和学习中，我才重新认识了自己，并体会到我个人的思想实有迫切改造的必要。这里，我愿意把这些认识和体会，片断地写出来，供技术工作者参考。
    第一是关于立场问题。我最初根本不知道“立场”是什么。后来阅读了些文件，才了解了“立场”的意义，但又认为技术人员只要把技术工作做得好，也就是为人民服务了，立场问题可以不必重视。今年五月，我到西南去参加土地改革工作，在当地工作队领导之下，才对地主阶级的残酷剥削觉得可恨，对农民的斗争积极性、农民的努力生产以及对农民的智慧也有了更深的认识，最重要的是初步地掌握了正确的立场。我在没有参加土地改革工作以前，常常听到一部分人，说起西南土地改革工作如何发生“偏差”，如何“过火”，如何“搞得很糟”。但是我在西南农村两个多月的工作当中，觉得如把过去地主对于农民的剥削压迫的残酷情况来衡量今日农民对于地主的待遇，可以说农民是太宽大了，因而我才进一步认识到所谓“偏差”、“过火”、“很糟”等问题，原来都是由地主的“传声筒”广播出来的。那些做义务“传声筒”的人由于在利害上或感情上和地主发生联系，或者他们本人就是地主出身，对地主表同情；所以他们只看见地主的利益，而看不到农民的痛苦；所以当地主的利益受到损害，到处叫嚣的时候，他们也就自觉地或不自觉地为地主叫嚣。从这里，我们可以看出来，站在封建地主剥削阶级立场的人们必然自觉地或不自觉地替地主阶级服务；惟有站在被剥削者的立场，才能认识到地主阶级的残酷，才能同情农民阶级的痛苦，才能支持农民的运动，判别真正的是非。所以一切是非都要根据立场来判断；立场不稳，是非的判断就会发生差误。经过这次土地改革运动和反复思考，我深感我在技术界数十年的工作，毫无人民立场，表面上是纯技术工作，实际上只是忠实地为反动阶级服务。数十年的一切努力，实质上是为了自己的名利而工作，从没想到那些工作对广大劳动人民有什么切身的利害关系，从没想到我是站在那个立场来工作。经过这次锻炼和学习，我才认识了我自己只有站在工人阶级的立场，才能正确地建立为人民服务的人生观；立场不正，是非不清，而空谈为人民服务，那简直等于骗人。
    第二是群众观点问题。小资产阶级意识浓厚的知识分子，尤其是技术界的知识分子，优越感最强，最是自高自大、自命不凡。理论是自己的高，创作是自己的好，因而不虚心学习，也不虚心接受别人的意见，脱离群众。记得一九四九年冬抢修粤汉线某铁路大桥的时候，因为须在水下锯断钢梁，但工地无“水底气切器”，我和若干工程师就都束手无策了。后来经一位工作同志提议，召集全队工作人员商量解决办法，结果由队中的一个非工程人员想出主意，制造不透水的木制长桶，把那段钢梁紧紧套着，然后将桶中水抽干，用普通的气切器将钢梁切断。这个主意解决了工程师们不能解决的问题，使粤汉全线如期通车。这使我大大地感动了，并使我体会到群众有无限的智慧，我们技术界知识分子，若不依靠群众，不结合群众，自高自大，是不可能为群众服务的。目前全国正在开展增产节约运动，为国家积累财富，以便大规模进行建设。我们技术界知识分子，必须和工人群众紧密地团结在一起，才能担当起这项工作。
    第三是方法问题。马列主义、毛泽东思想的方法，是唯物辩证法的科学方法，是经过调查研究从实践中来提高认识，解决问题的方法。但是从旧社会中成长起来的知识分子的思想方法，至少有一部分是脱离实际、闭门造车的。例如数年来国家基本建设，很多都是不做好设计就行施工，结果一再变更设计，浪费了人力物力，难道不是因为我们技术界知识分子犯了闭门造车、脱离实际的错误吗？我在一九五○年铁道部讨论成渝铁路的运量和路线标准时，只是根据过去的调查，参照旧中国各地农业及工商业发展的进度，来推断成渝铁路通车后的运量。直到今年参加土地改革，看到农村生产力解放后的发展，看到农民购买力提高后所引起的工商业的发展，我才开始了解到成渝铁路通车后的运量，已经不能用旧中国的数字作根据了。我们必须根据新的事实、新的情况来分析问题，经验主义、教条主义都是要不得的。这就说明我们技术界的思想方法必须是马列主义、毛泽东思想的辩证法，必须是根据事实的发展，结合调查研究来进行分析的科学方法，再不能用老一套的、不切合实际的、闭门造车的方法了。
    解放后两年来，我结合了工作中的实际问题进行学习，虽然有些小小的体会，但仍觉收获不大，进步不快。时代要求我们从旧社会来的技术人员，加速进行思想改造。改造思想就是改造旧的立场，改变旧的观点，改变旧的方法，坚决地站在工人阶级的立场，做人民的技术知识分子。要达到这个目的，我们必须认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想。技术工作者惟有用马列主义、毛泽东思想来彻底地改造自己、提高自己，才能使自己的技术和群众结合，才能担当起增产节约的任务，完成国家的生产建设。
    进行思想改造，必须好好地运用批评和自我批评的武器。我们是否敢于指摘我们工作中的缺点和思想上的问题，是否敢于批评别人，勇于接受别人的批评，这就是一个考验。让我们每一个技术界的知识分子认真展开批评和自我批评，加倍努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，以做好中国工业化的伟大工作吧。
