    Clerk Chen Jing of the Accounting Section of the Finance Department of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office,
    Conducts Conscientious Investigation and Research, Demonstrating Strong Responsibility, Saving the Country Over Seventy Million Yuan
    Editor: Last year, Chen Jing, a clerk in the Second Section of the Accounting Office of the Finance Department of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office, while working in the Finance Department's Management Office, conscientiously investigated and researched problems, saving the country a large amount of wealth.
    When Chen Jing distributed winter clothing last autumn, in addition to allocating 10,000 sets of winter clothing inventory and 30,000 to 40,000 sets of winter clothing lining fabric, he was also responsible for dyeing 2,400 bolts of fine white cloth. At that time, the dyeing fee was nearly 100,000 yuan per bolt. Chen Jing calculated the cost of dyes and labor in detail with the owner of the dyeing factory, and researched the color and dyeing methods with the workers, resulting in a reduction of the dyeing fee to 65,000 yuan per bolt; moreover, the dyed cloth color was very good. A total of 2,400 bolts of fine white cloth were dyed, saving a total of over 70 million yuan in dyeing fees. In his work, Chen Jing also continuously improved working methods and increased work efficiency, such as suggesting centralized accounting and merging accounts. This not only simplified procedures and brought into play the potential abilities of each staff member, but also saved a lot of accounting books and forms expenses. Xu Yunju

    苏北行署财政处会计室科员
    陈竞认真调查研究责任心强
    给国家节省了七千多万元
    编辑同志：去年，苏北行署财政处会计室第二科科员陈竞在财政处经管室工作时，认真调查研究和钻研问题，替国家节省了大量的财富。
    陈竞去年秋天发放冬衣时，除了调配一万套冬衣存货和三、四万套冬衣里子布外，并负责染制二千四百匹白细布。当时每匹染费约近十万元。陈竞和洗染厂老板详细计算颜料、人工，又和工人研究成色、染法，结果使染费减为每匹六万五千元；而且染的布色都很好。计染制二千四百匹白细布，共节省染费七千多万元。陈竞在工作中，还不断地改进工作方法，提高工作效率。如建议会计集中办公，合并账册等。这样，不但简化了手续发挥了每个工作人员的潜在能力，还节约了不少账册、表格费用。    徐云驹
