    Supreme People's Court Holds Cadre Meeting
    Mobilizing Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign
    President Shen Junru Calls for a Ruthless Struggle Against Corruption

    [Report from this newspaper] The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government convened a cadre meeting on the 3rd of this month to mobilize all cadres to launch an anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign. President Shen Junru made a call to all cadres to oppose corruption, carry out ideological remolding, and ensure the purity of the people's judicial work.

    President Shen Junru said: "Recently, our court has successively experienced the corruption incidents of three cadres, Gu Yushang, Shi Jinghou, and Hu Zhongjin, which we cannot ignore. We must recognize the seriousness of corrupt behavior. It harms the interests of the people and also damages the prestige of the People's Government and the People's Court. Therefore, we must launch an anti-corruption movement and wage a ruthless struggle against corruption." He also said: "In this study, we must make everyone ideologically realize the shamefulness of corrupt behavior. Every staff member should deeply detest corrupt behavior, treating it as an enemy. Any cadre who has engaged in corruption or disguised corruption should eliminate all concerns and frankly confess their crimes of corruption to the organization. Do not think that what you have done is very confidential, that the organization will not know, and that you can hide it. This idea is wrong. You must know that if you don't want others to know, don't do it. Didn't Gu Yushang and the other two think that they had done it very confidentially, but in the end they could not escape the giant palms of the people? It should be known that the awareness of the people and cadres is constantly improving. If you don't say it yourself, it will eventually be exposed. Moreover, sincere repentance and voluntary confession can be treated leniently. Conversely, if it is reported, then it will only be severely punished. The cadres in our court should launch self-exposure and mutual reporting. Everyone must expose all the materials they know about corruption or disguised corruption behaviors without reservation, without any concerns, and boldly report and expose with a spirit of responsibility to the people." President Shen Junru finally emphasized: "We must also call on the broad masses of people across the country to report corrupt elements among our national judicial cadres, and carry out an anti-corruption campaign nationwide. Because the corrupt behavior of lawbreakers cannot be hidden from the masses of the people, only the accusations and reports of the masses can fully and thoroughly expose the phenomenon of corruption and eliminate it."

    Vice President Wu Gaizhi then reported. Vice President Wu stated that the People's Government is different from any reactionary government of the past. Reactionary governments oppress, deceive, and swindle the people; the People's Government and every one of its staff members must have a revolutionary work style of integrity, simplicity, and service to the people. Some people say: "High salaries can foster integrity. Life is too hard. There is no way not to be corrupt." This statement is wrong. Of course, we are still in the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and government staff members are on a low-salary system, so life will not be comfortable, and some may even have some difficulties. But our government has not neglected us. In such a period, it has also made salary increases to appropriately solve the living difficulties of some staff members. Under the overall political task of increasing production and practicing economy, salary adjustments are still being made, and half a ton of coal is being distributed to subsidize the winter. This shows that our government is taking care of us. To be honest, our lives are much better than those of poor workers and peasants. Those who are corrupt are due to their bad character, not because of any living difficulties. Facts have proven that corruption is inseparable from corruption. In order to satisfy their own desires in life, they unscrupulously extort and blackmail, and pervert justice for bribes. Gu Yushang is like this, Shi Jinghou is also like this, and Hu Zhongjin is no exception. Vice President Wu went on to clarify that judicial staff should resolutely oppose all illegal behavior and stand at the forefront of the struggle against corruption and waste. They must assume important responsibility in completing the political task of anti-corruption and anti-waste. For this reason, our judicial cadres should be clean and self-respecting, and abide by laws and disciplines. Vice President Wu said: The discovery of three corrupt officials in our court has caused some unease among some old staff, who are afraid that the organization will reduce its trust in them in the future and resent these bad apples. These concerns and resentments are natural. Corrupt behavior is due to the bad habits left over from the old society. Even old cadres who have participated in the revolution for many years have individually been infected with this bad habit and have been eroded and degenerated. Conversely, among the old staff, there are also a large number who are good, have made significant progress in their studies, and are actively and responsibly in their work. Although their lives are difficult, they are still honest. This proves that Chairman Mao's policy of retaining and transforming old staff is correct. Therefore, the organization will never reduce its trust in all old staff members because a few old staff members have engaged in corrupt behavior. We must now use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to launch a struggle against corruption and waste, so as to transform all our staff and ensure the honest, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style of judicial cadres.

    Gu Yushang was a staff member of the Supreme People's Court, formerly a corrupt and insatiable judge of the pseudo-court. In April of this year, after the court received reports from the masses about his corrupt acts, he was escorted to the Beijing Municipal People's Court, and after a public trial on October 22, he was sentenced to death.

    Shi Jinghou was a clerk in the Civil Division of the Supreme People's Court, and in the past served as a guard in the Japanese puppet Beiping Detention Center, an employee of the Japanese puppet Beiyunhe River Affairs Bureau, a train conductor of the Shimen Railway, an inspector, and a clerk of the puppet High Court. He has always been corrupt and degenerate.

    Hu Zhongjin was a clerk in the Criminal Division, formerly a clerk in the puppet Hebei High Court, and was retained after the liberation of Beijing. This time, after being reported by someone, he admitted to four acts of corruption.

    最高人民法院召开干部大会
    动员开展反贪污反浪费运动
    沈钧儒院长号召向贪污现象作无情的斗争
    【本报讯】中央人民政府最高人民法院于本月三日召开干部大会，动员全体干部展开反贪污反浪费运动。沈钧儒院长向全体干部提出了反对贪污，进行思想改造，保证人民司法工作纯洁性的号召。
    沈钧儒院长说：“最近本院连续地发生了顾裕尚、史静侯、胡忠锦等三个干部贪污的事件，我们是不能忽视的。我们必须认识到贪污行为的严重性。它损害了人民的利益，也损害了人民政府和人民法院的威信。因此，我们必须展开反贪污运动，与贪污现象作无情的斗争。”他又说：“在这次学习里，必须使大家从思想上认识到贪污行为的可耻。每个人员对于贪污行为，应该深恶痛绝，如同对待敌人一样。凡是有贪污或变相贪污行为的干部，应消除一切顾虑，向组织上坦白出自己贪污的罪行。不要以为自己作的很机密，组织上不会知道，可以隐瞒过去，这种想法是错误的。要晓得若要人不知，除非己莫为。顾裕尚等三个人何尝不以为他自己做得很机密，但结果还是逃不出人民的巨掌。须知人民和干部的觉悟都在不断地提高，你自己不说，终久要被揭发出来的。而且真诚悔过，自动坦白，在处理时是可以从宽的。反之，如果是被检举出来了，那就只有严加惩办。我们法院里的干部应该展开自我揭发和互相检举，大家必须把自己所知道的贪污或变相贪污行为的材料，毫无保留地揭发出来，不要怀着什么顾虑，要以对人民负责的精神，大胆地来告发检举。”沈钧儒院长最后着重地指出：“我们还要号召全国的广大人民来检举我们全国的司法干部中的贪污分子，要在全国范围内开展反贪污运动。因为违法分子的贪污行为是瞒不了人民群众的，只有群众的告发、检举，才能全面地、彻底地揭破贪污现象，并把它消灭。”
    继由吴溉之副院长报告。吴副院长申述人民政府不同于任何反动时期的政府。反动政府是欺压、蒙蔽、诈骗人民的；人民政府和它的每个工作人员，必须具有廉洁、朴素、为人民服务的革命工作作风。有人说：“厚薪才能养廉，生活太苦了，不贪污没有办法。”这种说法是不对的。当然，我们现在还处在抗美援朝时期，政府工作人员是低薪制，生活不会优裕，有的或者还有些困难。但是我们的政府不是没有照顾，在这样的时期，还作过增薪的调整，适当地解决了某些工作人员生活上的困难。在整个增产节约的政治任务下，还在作增薪调整，并发半吨煤补助过冬，这说明我们的政府，对我们是有所照顾了。老实说，我们的生活比贫苦的工人和农民是要好的多了。贪污的人是由于他们的品质恶劣，而不是什么生活困难。事实证明，贪污是和腐化分不开的。为着满足自己生活上的欲望，无耻地敲诈勒索，贪污枉法，顾裕尚是如此，史静侯也是如此，胡忠锦也何尝不是如此。吴副院长接着更阐明，司法工作人员应当坚决反对一切犯法行为，要站在反贪污反浪费斗争的最前列。在完成反贪污反浪费的政治任务上要负起重要的责任。为此，我们的司法干部应该廉洁自爱，遵守法纪。吴副院长说：本院发现三个贪污案犯，都是旧人员，因此，引起某些旧人员的不安，恐怕组织上今后对他们减少信任，而愤恨这些害群之马。这些顾虑和愤恨是很自然的。贪污行为是由于旧社会遗留下来的恶习惯，参加革命多年的老干部，也有个别的沾染了这种恶习而被侵蚀蜕化。反过来说在旧人员中，也有很大数量是好的，在学习上有显著的进步，在工作上积极负责，虽然生活困难，还是廉洁的。这证明毛主席对于旧人员的留用与改造的政策是正确的。因此，组织上绝不因为少数旧人员发生了贪污行为，便减低了对所有的旧人员的信任。我们现在要运用批评与自我批评的武器，展开反贪污反浪费斗争，来改造我们的全体工作人员，这样才能保证司法干部廉洁的朴素的为人民服务的革命的工作作风。
    按顾裕尚是最高人民法院职员，原是贪赃无厌的伪法院推事。今年四月法院接到了群众对他的贪污事实的检举后，便把他押送到北京市人民法院，十月二十二日经过公审判决死刑。
    史静侯是最高人民法院民庭书记员，过去历充日伪北平看守所看守，日伪北运河河务局雇员、石门铁路列车长、稽查员、伪高等法院书记官等职。一贯贪污腐化。
    胡忠锦是刑庭书记员，前伪河北高等法院书记官，北京解放后被留用。此次经人告发，承认有过四起贪污的事实。
