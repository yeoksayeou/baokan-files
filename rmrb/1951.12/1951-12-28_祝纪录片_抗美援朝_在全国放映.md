    Congratulations on the Nationwide Screening of the Documentary "Resist America, Aid Korea"
    The first part of the documentary film "Resist America, Aid Korea" will be screened in forty-four major cities and many factories, troops, and rural areas across the country starting today. This is a welcome event.
    This film is a moving work of art that faithfully captures the great reality of the Chinese people's resistance to America and aid to Korea. Its outstanding achievement is primarily due to the unprecedented just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people; secondly, it is due to the fact that the writers, directors, and more than fifty photographers of this film, like the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers, went to the forefront of the struggle. Therefore, they were able to create such a moving work of art. In the history of China's young people's cinema, this documentary undoubtedly occupies a glorious position.
    In recent years, China's documentary films have achieved many valuable successes, and this documentary film "Resist America, Aid Korea" is the most important achievement among them. It has a high degree of generalization and demonstrates excellent editing and directing skills; its commentary is like a long poem, in tune with the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people. These all mark the advanced level of China's documentary films. From the beginning of filming to the completion of printing, all staff members demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalist revolutionary enthusiasm. Without this enthusiasm, this work could not have been produced.
    The screening of this film will further set off a high tide of patriotism and internationalism among the Chinese people. When people see the heroic posture of our "most beloved people," see the flesh-and-blood, interdependent relationship between China and Korea, and see the bloody crimes of imperialist aggressor bandits, we cannot help but feel our blood boiling. We must participate more enthusiastically in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and contribute more to defeating imperialist aggressors, rescuing our neighbors, and defending our motherland.
    In short, this is a film with great educational significance. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, wrote an inscription for the screening of this film: "Everyone should learn from the Volunteers and strive for the security of the motherland and the peace of the world with a high degree of self-sacrifice!" Vice Chairman Peng Zhen praised this as "a very good film," pointing out that "it uses ironclad and vivid facts to expose the bloody crimes and outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of the imperialist aggressors; it promotes the justice of the Chinese people's struggle to resist America and aid Korea and the heroic and skillful fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers. It can strengthen the will of peace-loving people all over the world and extinguish the 'prestige' of imperialist warmongers. It is a thoughtful and faithful historical record, and it is a militant and powerful educational weapon." Undoubtedly, this film will receive a widespread and enthusiastic welcome from the people of the whole country and the righteous people of the world.

    祝纪录片“抗美援朝”在全国放映
    文献纪录片“抗美援朝”第一部，今天起在全国四十四个大城市和许多工厂、部队、农村中放映，这是一件值得欢迎的事。
    这部影片是忠实地摄取了中国人民抗美援朝的伟大现实的动人的艺术品。它的杰出成就，首先是由于中朝人民的正义斗争是史无前例的；其次是由于这部影片的编导者和五十多位摄影师们，同人民志愿军的英雄们一样，走上了斗争的最前线，因此，他们才创造了这样动人的艺术作品。在年轻的我国人民电影的历史上，这部纪录片显然是占有辉煌的地位的。
    近几年来，我国纪录影片已经获得了许多宝贵的成绩，而这部“抗美援朝”的纪录影片则是其中最重要的成就。它具有很高的概括能力，表现了优秀的编辑和导演的手法；它的说明词像一首长诗，和中朝人民正义的斗争相合拍。这些都标志了我国文献纪录影片的高级水平。影片从开始摄制到洗印完成，全体工作人员都表现出高度的爱国主义和国际主义的革命热情。没有这种热情，这部作品是不可能产生的。
    这部电影的放映，将进一步掀起我国人民爱国主义和国际主义的高潮。当人们看到我们的“最可爱的人”的英勇姿态，看到中朝两国血肉相联、唇齿相依的情景，看到帝国主义侵略强盗的血腥罪行，我们就不禁热血沸腾起来，不能遏止。我们一定要更加热烈地参加抗美援朝的运动，为战胜帝国主义侵略者，救援我们的邻人，保卫我们的祖国而贡献更大的力量。
    总之，这是一部具有巨大教育意义的影片。中国人民抗美援朝总会郭沫若主席为这部影片的放映题词说：“人人向志愿军学习，以高度的自我牺牲精神，为祖国安全与世界和平的争取而奋斗！”彭真副主席赞美这“是一部很好的影片”，指出“它用铁一般的生动的事实，揭露了帝国主义侵略者的血腥罪恶和外强中干；宣扬了中国人民抗美援朝斗争的正义性和中国人民志愿军的英勇善战。它可以长全世界爱好和平的人民的志气，可以灭帝国主义战争贩子们的‘威风’。它是有思想性的忠实的历史记载，它是有战斗性的有力的教育武器。”无疑的，这部电影将获得全国人民和全世界正义人民的广泛的热烈的欢迎。
