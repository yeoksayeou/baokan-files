    Self-Criticism of Wang Mutian, Former Manager of the Beijing Branch of Zhonghua Book Company

    Editor: After reading the opinion raised by Comrade Cheng Xu in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on November 29th, "Dongfang Limin and other comrades from Jixian Middle School should not have accepted the 'hospitality' of Zhonghua Book Company," I also conducted a self-examination. As the person in charge of Zhonghua Book Company, I should be responsible for this incident. In the past, my understanding of this kind of thing was very vague. I always thought that it would be good to do more business, so I used the method of "entertaining" customers to achieve the purpose of doing business. This is an old society consciousness. Zhonghua Book Company joined the China Book Distribution Company in July of this year, and with correct leadership, we believe that such things will not happen again in the future.

    前中华书局北京分局经理的自我检讨
    编辑同志：在十一月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏内看到程序同志所提“蓟县中学东方立民等同志不该接受中华书局的‘招待’”的意见后，我也作了检讨。我是中华书局的负责人，这一事件我应当负责。过去，对这类事，我的认识是很模糊的。我总想到多做生意就好，所以就用“招待”顾客的方法，达到做生意的目的。这是一种旧社会的意识。中华书局已经在本年七月加入了中国图书发行公司，有了正确的领导，我们相信今后不会再有这类事情发生了。
