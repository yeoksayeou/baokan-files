    Improve Tunneling Efficiency, Preparing Conditions for Implementing New Coal Mining Methods
    ——Introducing the Advanced Experience of the Ma Liuhai Group of Datong Coal Mine
    Jiang Zhen
    The Ma Liuhai tunneling group of Datong Coal Mine in Chahar Province uses the "two and a half heading cyclical tunneling" method to improve tunneling efficiency, reduce material consumption, and create favorable conditions for implementing new coal mining methods. This is an advanced experience worthy of vigorous promotion in the production increase and economy campaign.
    The Datong Coal Mine Third Mine (Tongjialiang Mine), where the Ma Liuhai group is located, is a mine that was drained and restored in 1950. In August of the same year, this mine promoted new coal mining methods. At that time, this mine still used old-style roadway tunneling methods. The old-style roadway tunneling method was extremely inefficient, with a monthly progress of only thirty to forty meters, and the coal mining faces were opened very slowly, far from meeting the requirements of coal mining work. In order to solve this problem, in March of this year, Datong Coal Mine began to train the Ma Liuhai group to conduct rapid tunneling experiments. The Ma Liuhai group experimented with various rapid tunneling methods such as "multi-heading", "dual-heading", and "single-heading", and finally proved that the organizational form of "two and a half heading cyclical tunneling" was the most reasonable. The Ma Liuhai group used this method to continuously improve labor organization and operational techniques. By the end of September, they had continuously created three new records: 187 meters tunneled in May, 318 meters tunneled in June, and 479.88 meters tunneled in September. The leaders of Datong Mine summarized the experience of the Ma Liuhai group and opened the "Ma Liuhai Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" to vigorously promote the advanced experience of the Ma Liuhai group. In August, fifteen tunneling groups in Datong Coal Mine launched a production competition centered on "promoting advanced experience and improving production efficiency." In September, among the nineteen tunneling groups, thirteen groups had a progress of more than 200 meters, seven groups exceeded 300 meters, and four groups exceeded 400 meters. The tunneling efficiency in September increased by an average of 45.9 percent compared to April; gunpowder consumption per ton decreased by 3.05 percent; detonator consumption per ton decreased by 6.83 percent. However, the work of the Ma Liuhai group also had shortcomings. In their group, the speed of the transport workers could not keep up with the speed of the tunneling workers, and at the same time, the holes were not drilled deep enough. Therefore, their potential strength had not been fully exploited.
    The advanced experience of the Ma Liuhai group in improving tunneling efficiency and reducing material consumption is composed of the following parts:
    Adopting the method of two and a half heading cyclical operations to avoid wasting man-hours and improve the utilization rate of the working face and machinery. At present, many coal mines use the "single-heading tunneling method." The "single-heading tunneling method" not only wastes manpower, but also fails to fully utilize the working face and machinery. Tunneling workers using the "single-heading tunneling method" must wait for the smoke from the blasting to dissipate, the transport workers to load and transport the coal that has collapsed, and the working face to be cleaned before they can continue working. With the current operation methods, it takes at least an hour to load and transport the coal that has collapsed from an ordinary working face. The time it takes for advanced tunneling workers to drill holes is only about ten minutes on average each time, plus loading explosives, blasting, and other auxiliary work, it only takes about twenty minutes. That is to say, the actual working time of tunneling workers only accounts for about 20 percent of the total working hours. The "two and a half heading cyclical operation" implemented by the Ma Liuhai group is completely different. Tunneling workers excavate a parallel ventilation roadway while excavating the main roadway, with a distance of eight to ten meters between the two roadways. When the tunneling workers advance about 20 meters in the roadway, they then open a cross passage connecting the two parallel roadways for ventilation. Therefore, after the tunneling workers have blasted in the main roadway, they do not have to wait and immediately go to the ventilation roadway to drill holes, leaving the main roadway for the transport workers to load coal. This operation method eliminates the previous waste of time and greatly improves production efficiency and the utilization rate of tools and equipment. At the same time, because the work is orderly, it is conducive to adopting a scientific chart management system. Currently, some coal mines or tunneling groups still believe that adopting the cyclical operation method is very troublesome for tunneling workers to run back and forth; or they emphasize that the roadway specifications of the main roadway, ventilation roadway, and cross passage are different, and the same labor organization cannot be adopted. Therefore, some coal mines have adopted the method of tunneling two and a half headings simultaneously in form, but have equipped each working face with two or three drilling and blasting tunneling workers. In essence, this is still two or three single headings operating simultaneously, and there is still a waste of time.
    Clear division of labor is also one of the basic conditions for the success of the Ma Liuhai group. The Ma Liuhai group has a total of three people (including the group leader). Each person's work has a clear and detailed division of labor. After going to work, one person handles the handover procedures and checks the electric drill cotter pins, cables, and roadway specifications; one person collects explosives and tamping material and bundles the explosives; and another person sharpens the drilling bits. When the person handling the handover procedures has completed the formalities, the person preparing the explosives also arrives, and the two immediately go to the working face to drill holes with an electric drill. When the person sharpening the drill bits has sharpened the drill bits, the work of the drilling workers is also completed. The three people then immediately load the explosives. After the explosives are loaded, the other roadway is cleaned up, and at this time the two people who were originally drilling holes switch to this other roadway to drill holes. The person sharpening the drill bits stays in the original roadway to blast. After the blasting, the transport workers switch to this roadway to load coal and push the carts, and the blaster runs to the roadway where the holes are being drilled to help load explosives. Due to the clear division of labor, each worker understands their own responsibilities, and after going to work, they can each do their own work according to the division of labor, without having to ask anyone, and it is also easy to improve technology. Scientific division of labor also creates favorable conditions for implementing a piecework wage system. In other mines, mixed operations are generally still used, without a clear division of labor. In order to avoid wasting man-hours, some tunneling groups' tunneling workers also do the work of brushing the sides, shoveling coal, and cleaning the working face after blasting. This method violates the principle of dividing work types and hinders the implementation of advanced wage systems.
    Another characteristic of the Ma Liuhai group is that they solved the problem of unity and mutual assistance on the basis of strengthening the overall concept. The Datong Coal Mine has a three-shift system day and night. Tunneling workers are divided into three groups, working in the early, middle, and late shifts each day. There is no contact between the groups, and there is no unified leadership. When handing over shifts, the later shift does not understand the work situation of the previous shift, which often takes a lot of time. In May, after the Ma Liuhai group discovered this unreasonable situation, they united with two other tunneling groups to form a "round-the-clock" group, with Ma Liuhai as the group leader. The workers in the group formulated a patriotic pact and stipulated a handover system. Their handover system is: using ten minutes before work to hold a meeting, where the group from the previous shift tells the group taking over the shift in detail about the specific conditions in the roadway; the previous shift leaves a working face that has been cleared of coal and five sharpened drill bits for the next shift, so that the group taking over the shift has work to do immediately after going to work. Therefore, the three tunneling shifts formed a whole, allowing work to be carried out continuously.
    Tunneling work requires the cooperation of transport work. The Ma Liuhai group further united three transport groups, proposing that "completing the tunneling task is the common glory of the transport workers and the tunneling workers"; and distributing part of the group's bonus to the transport workers. They and the transport workers signed a contact contract, and each made guarantees to each other. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the transport workers has been greatly improved, and they quickly transport the coal stored on the working face, facilitating drilling and blasting work.
    The members of the Ma Liuhai group have a very high level of political awareness. They often use the heroic struggle of the Volunteers to encourage themselves to overcome difficulties. Their group is very united, and everyone can use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to help and supervise each other. In the past, the workers in this group only worked an average of fifteen times per month; now the attendance rate has reached over 95 percent.
    The Ma Liuhai group can also take the initiative to unite with technicians and humbly learn technology from them. The group holds technical meetings every week to review work shortcomings and study how to improve technology. Therefore, the Ma Liuhai group has had a series of technical improvements. This is also a reason why the Ma Liuhai group has continuously created new records.

    提高掘进效率，为实行新采煤法准备条件
    ——介绍大同煤矿马六孩小组的先进经验
    姜桢
    察哈尔省国营大同煤矿马六孩掘进小组运用“两个半孔道循环掘进”方法，提高掘进效率，降低材料消耗，为实行新采煤方法创造了有利的条件。在增产节约运动中，这是一个值得大力推广的先进经验。
    马六孩小组所在的大同煤矿第三矿（同家梁矿厂），是一九五○年排水恢复的矿井，同年八月，这个矿推广新式采煤法。当时这个矿仍然采用旧式巷道掘进方法。旧式巷道掘进方法效率极低，每月进度不过三十到四十公尺，采煤场子开辟得很慢，远不能适应采煤工作的要求。为了解决这个问题，今年三月，大同煤矿开始培养马六孩小组进行快速掘进的试验工作。马六孩小组试验了“多孔道”、“双孔道”、“单孔道”等多种快速掘进方法，最后证明以“两个半孔道循环掘进”的组织形式为最合理。马六孩小组运用这个方法，不断地改进劳动组织和操作技术，到九月底为止，连续创造了三次新纪录：五月份掘进一八七公尺，六月份掘进三一八公尺，九月份掘进四七九点八八公尺。大同矿的领导方面总结了马六孩小组的经验，开办了“马六孩先进经验传播班”，大力推广马六孩小组的先进经验。八月份大同煤矿有十五个掘进小组以“推广先进经验，提高生产效率”为中心，展开了生产竞赛。九月份，十九个掘进小组中，有十三个小组的进度超过了二○○公尺，七个小组超过了三○○公尺，四个小组超过了四○○公尺。九月份的掘进效率较四月份平均提高了百分之四五点九；火药吨耗降低了百分之三点○五；雷管吨耗降低了百分之六点八三。但是，马六孩小组的工作也还是有缺点的。在他们组里，运搬工的速度还赶不上掘进工的速度，同时，打眼打得还不够深。因此，他们的潜在力量还没有充分发挥出来。
    马六孩小组提高掘进效率，降低材料消耗的先进经验是由以下几部分组成的：
    采用两个半孔道循环作业的办法，避免浪费工时，提高工作面和机械的利用率。目前，不少煤矿都采用“单孔道掘进办法”。“单孔道掘进办法”不但浪费人力，并且不能充分运用工作面和机械。采用“单孔道掘进法”的掘进工，每放完一遍炮之后，必须等到炮烟消散，搬运工把崩下来的煤炭装运出去，并且清理了工作面之后，才能继续工作。普通一个工作面所崩下来的煤，以现在的作业方式，最快也需要一个多钟头才能装运完毕。而先进的掘进工打眼的时间每次平均不过十多分钟，加上装药、放炮以及其他辅助工作，也不过二十多分钟。这就是说，掘进工正式作业的时间，不过占全工时的百分之二十左右。马六孩小组实行的“两个半孔道循环作业”就根本不同了。掘进工人在开凿正巷的同时，又开凿一个平行风巷，两巷相距八公尺到十公尺。掘进工在巷道每进二十公尺左右时，再开一个横巷贯通两平行巷道，以便通风。因此，掘进工在正巷放完一遍炮后，不必等待，马上到风巷打眼，留下正巷让搬运工装煤。这种作业方法，消灭了过去的窝工浪费，大大提高了生产效率和工具设备的利用率。同时，因为工作有秩序，有利于采用科学的图表管理制。目前有些煤矿或掘进小组，仍然认为采用循环作业的办法，掘进工人跑来跑去非常麻烦；或者强调正巷和风巷、横巷的巷道规格不同，不能采用同样的劳动组织。因此有些煤矿形式上采用了两个半孔道同时掘进的办法，但是却给每个工作面配备两三个打眼放炮的掘进工。这样，实质上还是两三个单孔道同时作业，仍然有窝工浪费现象。
    分工明确，也是马六孩小组成功的基本条件之一。马六孩小组共有三个人（连组长在内）。每个人的工作都有明确详细的分工。上班之后，一人办理交接班手续，检查电钻插梢、电缆和巷道规格；一人领炮药、炮土，捆药；另一人磨打眼的钎子。当交接班的人办清手续之后，准备炮药的人也来了，两人马上就到工作面用电钻打眼。等到磨钎子的人磨好钎子时，打眼工人的工作也就完成了。三个人便紧接着装炮。炮药装好之后，另一巷道也就清理出来了，这时原来打眼的两个人就转入这另一巷道打眼。磨钎子的人留在原巷道内放炮。炮放完之后，运搬工人就转入这个巷道装煤推车，放炮人又跑到正在打眼的巷道内去帮助装药。由于分工明确，每个工作者都明了自己的专责，上班后，就可以按照分工各干各的活，谁也不必问谁，同时也容易提高技术。科学分工也给实行计件工资制度创造了有利条件。在其他矿山里，一般都还采用混合作业的办法，而没有明确的分工。为了怕浪费工时，有些掘进小组的掘进工在放完炮之后又去做刷帮、攉煤和清理工作面的工作。这种办法违背了工种划分的原则，并且妨碍实行先进工资制度。
    马六孩小组的另一个特点是在加强整体观念的基础上解决了团结互助。大同煤矿是日夜三班制。掘进工每天三小组，分为早中晚三班工作。各组之间互不联系，也没有统一领导。交接班时，后班不了解前班的工作情况，往往因此花费很多时间。五月间，马六孩小组发现了这种不合理的情况后，便团结另外两个掘进小组，组成一个“圆班”大组，由马六孩担任大组长。大组中的工人订立了爱国公约，并且规定了交接班制度。他们的交接班制度是：利用上班前十分钟举行碰头会，前班的小组把巷道内的各种具体情况，详细地讲给接班的小组；前班给后班留出一个运清煤炭的工作面和五根磨好的钎子，使接班的小组上班后马上就有工作做。因此，三个掘进班就结成了一个整体，使工作得以连续进行。
    掘进工作是需要搬运工作配合的。马六孩小组更进一步地团结了三个搬运小组，提出“完成掘进任务，是运搬工和掘进工共同的光荣”；并把组里的奖金，分一部分给运搬工。他们和运搬工订立了联系合同，彼此提出保证。因此，运搬工的积极性大大地提高了，他们把工作面上的存煤很快地运出，便利了打眼放炮工作。
    马六孩小组的组员，政治觉悟是很高的。他们经常以志愿军英勇奋斗的情形来鼓励自己克服困难。他们的小组团结得很好，大家能够运用批评与自我批评的武器，互相帮助、互相监督。过去这个小组的工人平均每人每月只上十五次班；现在出勤率已达到百分之九十五以上。
    马六孩小组还能够主动地团结技术人员，虚心地向他们学习技术。小组里每星期开技术会，检讨工作缺点，研究如何提高技术。因此，马六孩小组有了一连串的技术改进。这也是马六孩小组连创新纪录的一个原因。
