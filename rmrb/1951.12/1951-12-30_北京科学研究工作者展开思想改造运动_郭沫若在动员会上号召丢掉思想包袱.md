    Beijing Scientific Researchers Launch Ideological Remolding Movement
   Guo Moruo Calls for Shedding Ideological Burdens at Mobilization Meeting
    Beijing's scientific research workers have launched an ideological remolding study movement starting in early December. Participants in this study include 320 research and technical personnel from various Beijing-based units affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences; 100 researchers from the Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government are also participating. The purpose of the study is to remold the thinking of scientific workers, to enable them to understand the times, distinguish between friend and foe, criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois erroneous thinking, and establish a revolutionary stance of serving the people, in order to improve scientific research work. The study period is set for four months. In order to lead this study movement, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established the "Chinese Academy of Sciences Research Personnel Study Committee" on November 22, with President Guo Moruo as the chairman and Vice Presidents Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, etc., as the vice chairmen.
    On December 18, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a mobilization meeting for the ideological remolding study movement. At the meeting, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Shao Quanlin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, delivered reports.
    In his report, Guo Moruo first explained the importance of ideological remolding from the perspective of the laws of social development and the future of national construction. Intellectuals, especially scientists, shoulder very important tasks in today's national industrial, agricultural, and defense construction, and in improving the people's living standards. However, there are still many serious erroneous ideas among intellectuals. First of all, these ideological burdens must be shed, and they must arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism in order to shoulder the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the state. Therefore, intellectuals, especially scientists, must first transform their own thinking. He then made a detailed analysis and criticism of some of the erroneous ideas that currently exist among scientific workers, pointing out that in today's society, liberalism, individualism, and supra-class, supra-political thinking are detrimental to national development and individual progress, and should be resolutely abandoned. Guo Moruo pointed out: Now some people are singing the "revolutionary division of labor theory," saying: "You be your revolutionaries, and I'll be my scientist." Some also say that China's political level is already high enough, but its scientific level is not high, and now we mainly need to improve the scientific level rather than the political level. This kind of view is one-sided. Although science and technology themselves have no class character, scientists and technicians must belong to this or that class; just as weapons themselves have no class character, the people who use weapons can use them for revolution or counter-revolution. Here, he also emphatically criticized the muddled thinking of not distinguishing between friend and foe, such as sending scientific papers to imperialist countries for publication and feeling honored for it. He also pointed out that due to these erroneous ideas, many scientists are indifferent to the calls of the country and the needs of the people, and are indulging in aimless research, making useful manpower and material resources a waste. Guo Moruo called on scientific workers to study hard with love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and love for the useful manpower and material resources of the country, to correct their erroneous thinking, and to overcome the shortcomings in scientific research work.
    In his report, Shao Quanlin pointed out the tasks of scientific and technological workers in the process of the country gradually moving towards industrialization. He pointed out that as people's scientists, they must combine with the working class and serve the working people in order to give play to the role of science in serving the people; and to combine with the working class, and to be able to serve the vast working people well, they must first transform themselves with the thinking of the working class.

### 北京科学研究工作者展开思想改造运动 郭沫若在动员会上号召丢掉思想包袱

    北京科学研究工作者展开思想改造运动
   郭沫若在动员会上号召丢掉思想包袱
    北京的科学研究工作者已从十二月上旬起展开了思想改造学习运动。参加这次学习的有中国科学院所属在京各单位的研究技术人员三百二十人；中央人民政府铁道部铁道研究所的研究人员一百人也参加学习。学习的目的是为了改造科学工作者的思想，使他们认清时代，划分敌我，批判资产阶级和小资产阶级的错误思想，确立为人民服务的革命立场，以改进科学研究工作。学习时间定为四个月。为了领导这次学习运动，中国科学院在十一月二十二日成立了“中国科学院研究人员学习委员会”，由郭沫若院长任主任委员，副院长李四光、陶孟和、竺可桢、吴有训等任副主任委员。
    十二月十八日，中国科学院举行了思想改造学习运动的动员大会。会上，中国科学院院长郭沫若和中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副秘书长邵荃麟作了报告。
    郭沫若在报告中首先从社会发展的规律和国家建设的前途说明了思想改造的重要性。知识分子，特别是科学家在今天国家工业、农业和国防建设上，在提高人民生活水平上担负着非常重大的任务。但在知识分子中间还存在着许多严重的错误思想，首先要把这些思想包袱丢掉，用马克思列宁主义来把自己武装起来，才能担负起国家所赋予的光荣的任务。因此知识分子特别是科学家必须首先改造自己的思想。他接着对当前科学工作者中所存在的一些错误思想作了详细的分析和批判，指出自由主义、个人主义、超阶级、超政治的思想，在今天的社会里面是有碍国家发展和个人进步的，应该下决心抛弃。郭沫若指出：现在有人唱着“革命分工论”，他们说：“你做你的革命家，我做我的科学家。”也有人说，中国的政治水平已经够高，科学水平不高，现在我们主要是提高科学水平而不是政治水平。这一类看法是片面的。科学技术本身虽没有阶级性，但是科学家和技术家一定属于这个或那个阶级；正如武器本身无阶级性，而用武器的人可以用来革命，也可以用来反革命一样。在这里他还着重地批判了把科学论文送到帝国主义国家去发表而自以为光荣的那种敌我不分的糊涂思想。他并且指出，由于上述这些错误思想，有好些科学家对国家的号召、人民的需要漠不关心，而沉缅于无目的的研究，使有用的人力物力形同浪费。郭沫若号召科学工作者以对祖国的热爱，对人民的热爱，对劳动的热爱，对科学的热爱，对于国家有用的人力物力的热爱，来努力学习，纠正自己的错误思想，克服科学研究工作中的缺点。
    邵荃麟在报告中指出了科学技术工作者在国家逐步走向工业化过程中的任务。他指出，作为人民的科学家必须与工人阶级结合，为劳动人民服务，才能发挥科学服务于人民的作用；而要和工人阶级结合，要能很好地为广大的劳动人民服务，首先就要用工人阶级的思想来改造自己。
