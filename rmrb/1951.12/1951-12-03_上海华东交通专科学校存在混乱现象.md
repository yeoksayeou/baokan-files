    Chaotic Phenomena at Shanghai East China Transportation Vocational School

    To the Editor: Our East China Transportation Vocational School is severely plagued by chaotic phenomena: In terms of departmental divisions, there are one-year Transportation Management and Civil Engineering departments, two-year Mechanical and Civil Engineering departments, and five-year Management, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering departments. Our school site is small and the equipment is rudimentary. We have no library, no practice workshop, and a lack of machines for experiments. However, instead of trying to improve the teaching equipment, the school leadership spent twenty billion RMB to build a large auditorium, and engaged in extravagant waste during the opening ceremony. Due to the laxity of the school's administrative leadership, our school has not yet established a patriotic pact. Many teachers still lecture in English, which the students cannot understand. The school administration also does not care about students' withdrawals and transfers.

    We hope that relevant departments will pay attention to the chaotic situation in our school. In the future, when carrying out the work of adjusting departments and faculties, we hope the school will be appropriately adjusted, or that our school will be entirely merged into the engineering college of a university (our school is very close to Jiaotong University). This will not only save national education funds but also concentrate efforts to run vocational education well.

### 上海华东交通专科学校存在混乱现象

    上海华东交通专科学校存在混乱现象
    编辑同志：我们华东交通专科学校严重地存在着混乱现象：在分科方面，有一年制的交通运输管理科、土木工程科，有二年制的机械、土木两科和五年制的管理、土木、机械等科。我校的校址狭小，设备简陋，没有图书馆，没有实习工场，缺少供实验用的机器。但学校领导方面不去设法改善教学上的设备，却化了二十亿元人民币盖了一座大礼堂，在开学典礼时，并大事铺张浪费。由于学校行政领导的松懈，我校至今还没有订立爱国公约。有很多教师仍用英文讲课，使同学们听也听不懂。学校行政方面对学生的退学、转学事宜亦不加过问。
    我们希望有关部门注意我校的混乱情形，将来在进行院系调整工作的时候，对我校加以适当的调整，或把我校全部归并入大学的工学院（我校离交通大学是很近的）。这样不但可以为国家节省教育经费，并且可以集中力量办好专科教育。
