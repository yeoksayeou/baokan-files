Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The Central People's Government's Trade Department, in view of the completion of land reform in vast areas of the country, the rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, and the increased purchasing power of urban and rural working people, anticipates a significant increase in the demand for staple foods, non-staple foods, and general merchandise during the New Year period compared to previous years. Therefore, on November 29th, it issued instructions to national trade departments to stabilize prices during the New Year period.

    The instructions first require local trade administrative departments and specialized companies to make preparations for materials in advance, with planning and organization. There should be a sufficient supply of major materials (such as rice, flour, sugar, oil, salt, etc.) and general merchandise in both wholesale and retail markets. Supply disruptions are not permitted, and price increases are not allowed. For non-staple foods, fish, meat, chicken, eggs, vegetables, fresh and dried fruits, etc., state-owned trading companies should prepare a force sufficient to stabilize wholesale prices; organize private merchants and cooperatives to jointly prepare materials. The specialized companies operating the above-mentioned commodities should be fully responsible for controlling and ensuring timely supply.

    Secondly, the instructions require trade departments in various locations to resolutely stabilize prices and maintain reasonable regional price differences and wholesale-retail price differences to encourage private merchants to transport goods with appropriate profits, taking into account the interests of production, transportation, and sales.

    Thirdly, the instructions require various regions to strengthen market management during the New Year period. Trade administrative departments at all levels should convene industry associations, call for the practice of patriotic covenants, refrain from raising prices, avoid disrupting the market, and work together with state-owned companies to complete the task of regulating supply and demand. For commodities that are necessary for the general public but for which the state has not yet stipulated list prices, meetings should be held with private merchants to negotiate prices, and the agreed prices should be published in newspapers to encourage public supervision and the reporting of profiteers who do not comply with the negotiated prices. Individual unscrupulous merchants who disrupt the market and raise prices must be severely punished. Feudal habits must be opposed, and barbershops and bathhouses are not allowed to raise prices. Administrative departments at all levels should organize a certain number of cadres to strengthen inspections of market prices.

    Fourthly, the instructions require various regions to strengthen publicity work. Through newspapers and radio stations, publicize the state's material preparations for the New Year period and price control measures, explaining the People's Government's determination to guarantee supply and stabilize prices, so as to reassure the public and curb speculation.

    The instructions finally require trade administrative departments and specialized companies at all levels to immediately study and implement the arrangements.
