    New Life Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative under the North China Military Region
    Self-Criticism on Illegal and Irregular Coal Sales
    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published a letter from Li Nansheng, manager of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, in the "Letters from Readers" column on November 6, exposing the illegal and irregular coal sales of the New Life Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the political department of the North China Military Region, the superior authority of the New Life Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, together with the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, sent personnel to conduct a serious inspection and strictly criticized the mistakes made by the New Life Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative. The New Life Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has made a self-criticism of this matter. An abstract of this self-criticism is published below.
    According to the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council regarding the scope of coal supply and sales by the Logistics Production Department of the North China Military Region, we have indeed violated the principle of "limited to internal supply within the North China troops." In the past ten months, there have been many instances of the cooperative exceeding the scope of supply and sales. The Beijing General Cooperative, Baoding Branch, Kouquan Branch, and Shide Railway Line Branch have all sold large quantities of coal to public and private enterprises. In September, upon receiving a letter from the Supply Department of the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, we even shipped 5,000 tons of coal to a certain unit in Shanghai. However, there were no instances of selling at high prices or hoarding for speculation.
    The China Coal Industry Building Materials Company pointed out the above issue of exceeding the scope of coal sales in letters during July and August. At that time, we also made a self-criticism and stopped supplying some subscribers. However, we did not completely stop supplying certain fuel users because their contracts had not yet expired, and we continued to supply them even after the contracts expired. What was particularly serious was exceeding the North China region and shipping coal to a certain unit in Shanghai, which was even more inappropriate. The main reason for the above errors was our lack of an overall perspective and our purely profit-oriented viewpoint, which showed insufficient respect for the instructions of higher authorities. We only saw the local needs and seized on some one-sided bases, thinking that there was nothing wrong with exceeding the scope a little. Therefore, when troops were transferred or when local government letters requested coal sales, we arbitrarily made decisions to sell coal without first asking for instructions or reporting afterwards, which led to the above more serious errors after the August self-criticism.
    After inspecting the above errors, we believe that the public exposure and criticism by Manager Li Nansheng of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in the People's Daily has indeed given us a great education. In addition to making a profound self-criticism and expressing sincere acceptance, we immediately convened a meeting of Beijing municipal public enterprise fuel users on November 8, explaining the reasons why we could not supply them, and transferred the list along with the contracts to the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company for supply and sales. We also sent personnel to the Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Kouquan branches to terminate supply and sales relationships with all fuel users who were outside the scope of supply and sales, starting from November 10.

### 华北军区所属新生煤炭供销社  对违法乱售煤炭的检讨

    华北军区所属新生煤炭供销社
    对违法乱售煤炭的检讨
    编者按：本报十一月六日“读者来信”栏发表了中国煤业建筑器材公司经理李南生揭发新生煤炭供销社违法乱售煤炭的来信以后，新生煤炭供销社上级机关华北军区政治部就会同军委后勤部，派员认真检查，并对新生煤炭供销社所犯错误，进行了严格批评。新生煤炭供销社对这件事作了检讨。现把这一检讨摘要发表在下面。
    根据政务院财政经济委员会给华北军区后勤生产部供销煤炭范围的批示，我们的确是违背了“只限华北部队内部供应”的原则的。十个月来本社超出供销范围的事有很多起。北京总社、保定分社、口泉分社、石德线分社等都曾卖给公、私企业大量煤炭，九月份经军委总后勤部供应处来信，并曾运给上海某部煤炭五千吨。但并没有高价出售，或囤积投机等情事。
    上述超出售煤范围的问题，虽经中国煤业建筑器材公司在七、八月间来信指出，当时我们也曾做了检讨，并停止了一部分订户，但对某些燃户因合同期还没满，就没有全部停止，并在合同期满后还是继续供应了。尤其严重的，是超出华北区，运煤给上海某部，更是不应当。产生以上错误的原因，主要是因为我们缺乏整体观念和有单纯的营利观点，表现了对上级的指示尊重不够，只看到局部需要和抓住一些片面根据，就认为超出些范围也没有什么。因此，当军队调动或有当地政府公函要求售煤时，就擅自作主卖煤，事先既不请示，事后也没有报告，以致八月份检讨后，又犯了上述更为严重的错误。
    经过对上述错误的检查，我们认为中国煤业建筑器材公司李南生经理在人民日报的公开揭发与批评，确实给了我们很大教育。我们除作深刻检讨，并表示诚恳接受外，随即在十一月八日召开了北京市公营企业燃户会议，说明不能供应理由，并列表连同合同一并转给中国煤业建筑器材公司供售；又派员到保定、石家庄、口泉各分社，对超出供销范围的燃户，从十一月十日一律停止供销关系。
