    Central-South District Tax Bureau
    The Wuxi Town Tax Office's Unauthorized Reduction of Tax Rates Has Been Dealt With
    Comrade Editor: After the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column published reader Yang Xiling's criticism on August 31st regarding the Wuxi Town Tax Office under the jurisdiction of Luxi County, Hunan Province, for not collecting business tax according to the prescribed tax rate, this bureau dispatched personnel to form an inspection team together with the Hunan Provincial Tax Bureau, the Yuanling Special District Tax Bureau, and the Luxi County Tax Bureau, for a detailed inspection. The inspection results and proposed handling measures are written below:

    In the first half of 1951, six commercial firms in Wuxi Town, including Tongyi and Zheng Lichang in the oil and salt industry and Fucheng and Dafeng in the cotton cloth industry, had a total sales volume of 18.12 million yuan for tung oil. They were all taxed at a rate of 2% based on the business volume of their respective industries, instead of being taxed separately as required by tax law (tung oil should be taxed at 3%), resulting in an undercollection of 181,000 yuan. Regarding the Trade Company: From January to June of this year, a total of 147,840 catties of tung oil were allocated. According to tax law, internal transfers between the head, branch, and subsidiary companies of an organization do not constitute business transactions and are not subject to business tax. (Note: Reader Yang Xiling's reflection that the Wuxi Town Tax Office undercollected 6 million yuan from the Trade Company is inaccurate.) However, for a portion of the tung oil sales amounting to 25.18 million yuan, the Wuxi Town Tax Office also taxed it at a rate of 2%, resulting in an undercollection of 251,000 yuan. In addition, the Wuxi Town Tax Office also undercollected 921,000 yuan in tung oil business tax last year. The total undercollection amounted to 1,353,000 yuan.

    The main reasons for the above errors are the Wuxi Town Tax Office cadres' insufficient study of policies, their irresponsibility in their work, and their serious careless work style. In addition, the Luxi County Tax Bureau should also bear considerable responsibility (they have made a self-criticism) for its lax supervision of the work of its subordinate tax offices. This bureau has initially decided: From 1951 onwards, taxes will be supplemented in accordance with the results of this inspection. To take care of the economic situation of private businesses, taxes before 1951 will not be supplemented. The personnel of the Wuxi Tax Office should strengthen their policy and business studies in the future to improve their political and professional level. At the same time, tax authorities at all levels should pay attention to the inspection of work in remote areas in the future, strengthen the education of tax cadres, so as to gradually improve their political and professional level, and reduce or eliminate deviations in tax work.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中南区税务管理局
    对武溪镇税务所擅自降低税率已作处理
    编辑同志：八月三十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了读者杨西伶对湖南泸溪县所属武溪镇税务所不按规定税率征收营业税的批评以后，本局曾经派员会同湖南省税务局、沅陵专区税务局和泸溪县税务局，组成检查小组，详细检查。现在把检查结果和处理意见写在后面：
    一九五一年上半年，武溪镇油盐业同益、郑立昌和棉布业复诚、大丰等六家商号，共计本销桐油营业额一千八百一十二万元，都按本业营业额并用百分之二税率课征，而没有按税法规定分别课征（桐油应征百分之三），因而少征税款十八万一千元。贸易公司方面：在今年一月到六月共拨出桐油十四万七千八百四十斤，按税法规定，总、分、支公司机构内部调拨不算营业行为，不课征营业税。（按：读者杨西伶反映武溪镇税务所少收贸易公司税款六百万元不确。）但有一部分本销的桐油营业额二千五百十八万元，武溪镇税务所也按百分之二税率课征，计少征税款二十五万一千元。此外，武溪镇税务所在去年还少征桐油营业税九十二万一千元。以上共计少征税款一百三十五万三千元。
    造成以上错误的主要原因是武溪镇税务所的干部对政策学习不够，对工作不负责任和严重的粗枝大叶作风。此外，泸溪县税务局对所属税务所工作疏于检查，也应负相当责任（已作检讨）。现在本局已初步决定：自一九五一年起，一律按这次检查结果补税。为照顾私营商业的经济情况，一九五一年以前的不再补税。武溪税务所人员今后应加强政策和业务学习，提高自己的政治和业务水平。同时各级税务领导机关今后也应注意对边远地区工作的检查，加强对税务工作干部的教育，以逐渐提高他们的政治和业务水平，使税收工作少出或不出偏差。
