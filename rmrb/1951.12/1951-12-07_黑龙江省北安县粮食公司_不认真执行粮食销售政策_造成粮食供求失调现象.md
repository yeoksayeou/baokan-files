    Beian County Grain Company, Heilongjiang Province,
    Fails to Implement Grain Sales Policies Diligently,
    Causing Imbalance Between Grain Supply and Demand
    Editor: The Beian County Grain Company in Heilongjiang Province lacks operational planning and does not diligently implement grain sales policies, arbitrarily dumping grain, causing an imbalance between grain supply and demand and creating opportunities for private merchants to engage in speculation. The local people are very dissatisfied with the company. For example, the Fourth Quarter grain needs of a certain factory's worker cooperative is 345,000 jin per month, but the grain company only allocates 140,000 jin, which cannot meet the needs of the workers, causing the workers to think that as soon as they get money, they immediately store grain to avoid a famine. Another example: in October, the grain company sold a large amount of grain in the retail department but did not allocate it to the cooperatives for sale, which made the workers dissatisfied with the cooperatives. Some people say: "We can't buy grain even if we join the cooperative, so what's the point of joining?" Sometimes, in order to buy grain, citizens line up early in the morning at the gate of the grain company, but they are not guaranteed to be able to buy it, which causes public dissatisfaction with the grain company. The leading comrades of the company should immediately check and correct their mistakes.

    黑龙江省北安县粮食公司
    不认真执行粮食销售政策
    造成粮食供求失调现象
    编辑同志：黑龙江省北安县粮食公司缺乏经营计划，不认真执行粮食销售政策，任意抛售粮食，造成粮食供求失调，私商投机取巧现象。当地群众对该公司甚为不满。如某厂职工合作社第四季度每月需粮食三十四万五千斤，而粮食公司仅拨给十四万斤，不能满足职工们的需要，使职工们产生了一拿到钱就马上存粮，以免发生粮荒的想法。又如在十月份有一次粮食公司在门市部大量抛售粮食，而不拨给各合作社卖，这又使职工们对合作社不满。有些人说：“咱们加入合作社也买不到粮食，那何苦加入？”有时市民为了要买到粮食，一早就到粮食公司门口去站队，但还不一定能买到，因而引起群众对粮食公司的不满。该公司领导同志应即检查改正错误。
