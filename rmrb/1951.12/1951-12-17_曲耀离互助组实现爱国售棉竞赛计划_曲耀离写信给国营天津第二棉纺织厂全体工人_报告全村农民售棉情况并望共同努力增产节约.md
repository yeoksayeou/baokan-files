    The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group Achieves Patriotic Cotton Sales Competition Plan
    Qu Yaoli Writes to All Workers of State-Owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory
    Reporting on the Cotton Sales Situation of the Whole Village and Hoping to Work Together to Increase Production and Practice Economy
    The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group has realized the patriotic cotton sales challenge competition plan proposed to mutual aid groups and cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country. This year, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group picked a total of 26,344 jin of seed cotton. Except for 3 jin of batting cotton retained per person, the remaining more than 26,000 jin of seed cotton has been sold to the state. From the end of September, when they sold the first 200 jin of seed cotton picked to the state cotton ginning factory, to the end of November, when the last truckload of cotton was sent to the cooperative, each member of the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group was working hard to fulfill their competition plan for sixty days. This autumn, there was a lot of rain in southern Shanxi, and the cotton matured relatively late, but because they organized all 24 people in the group who could work, and carried out appropriate division of labor according to each person's physical strength, they finally picked, dried, and ginned the cotton in time, quickly sold it to the cooperative, and ensured the grading and quality of the cotton. This group has four children aged seven to eleven, who can also pick 40 jin of cotton per day. Qu Yaoli's 74-year-old mother also turns and dries cotton in the yard every day. She said: "I am always careful, for fear of mixing the top cotton and waist cotton and ruining the specifications."
    At present, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group is actively preparing for increasing cotton production next year. They have bought a mule, two waterwheels, and dug two new wells, and plan to buy another 25 pieces of large and small farm tools, two carts, and a mule, as well as fertilizer. The whole group also deposited 7 million yuan from cotton sales into the state bank, preparing to expand reproduction next year. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Qu Yaoli wrote a letter to the workers of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, reporting on the patriotic cotton sales situation, and hoping that workers and peasants will unite closely and strive to increase production and practice economy. The following is the original text of the letter: To Comrade Wang Deshan and Comrade Sun Guilan, model workers of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and forwarded to all workers:
    When I visited Tianjin, I am extremely grateful for your warm welcome and hospitality. Now that we have been separated for more than a month, I often think of you and your production. I think that the yarn factory is so big, there are so many spindles, and the machines are running so fast that if the cotton cannot be supplied in one minute, it will delay production and cause great losses to the country. Therefore, after I came back, I emphasized the importance of selling cotton to the state in a timely manner at various cadre or mass meetings. Our mutual aid group did just that. However, because of a rain, the cotton opened a few days late, and the group members were very anxious. Later, after picking the cotton, we quickly used the cotton ginning machine to gin it day and night. By November 6, the whole group had ginned 22,296 jin. After paying public grain, pre-purchases, and donations totaling 1,417 jin, the rest has been sold to the state. We were slightly relieved after selling this large amount of cotton. Now our cotton has been harvested, and by November 27, 25,404 jin have been sold. We are now mobilizing the whole village to continue selling cotton. Currently, the whole village has sold 50 percent of the cotton production.
    The cotton harvested this autumn is not as good as before, so our group separated the good from the bad for sale, and mobilized the whole village to do the same. You told us to make the cotton clean to prevent damage to the machines, and we have paid attention to doing so. I hope you spin well and send it to the front for the most beloved people to wear!
    This year, our whole village has had a bumper harvest of cotton. I think you have seen it in the newspapers, right? I think that the reason why our village can have such a bumper harvest is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I hope that our workers and peasants will unite more closely, do a good job in industrial and agricultural production next year, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." I myself plan to create a new record of producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu next year. I hope you will also tell us about your production situation.
    I wish you a victory in production!
                             Qu Yaoli, November 30

    曲耀离互助组实现爱国售棉竞赛计划
    曲耀离写信给国营天津第二棉纺织厂全体工人
    报告全村农民售棉情况并望共同努力增产节约
    曲耀离互助组已实现了向全国产棉区互助组和棉农提出的爱国售棉挑战竞赛计划。今年，曲耀离互助组共摘籽棉二万六千三百四十四斤，除每人留三斤絮棉外，其余的二万六千多斤籽花已全部卖给国家。从九月底他们把第一次摘下的二百斤籽花卖给国家轧花厂起，到十一月下旬把最后一车皮棉送到合作社止，先后六十天中，曲耀离互助组的每个组员都紧张地履行着自己的竞赛计划。晋南今秋多雨，棉花成熟较晚，但他们由于把全组可以劳动的二十四个人全部组织起来，根据各人体力进行了适当的分工，终于把棉花及时摘下、晒干、轧出，很快卖给合作社，并保证了棉花的分级和质量。他们这个组有四个七岁到十一岁的小孩，每天也能摘棉四十斤。曲耀离七十四岁的母亲，每天也在院子里翻晒棉花。她说：“我时刻在小心，怕把梢花和腰花混起来坏了规格。”
    目前，曲耀离互助组正积极进行明年增产棉花的准备工作。他们已买回骡子一头，水车两部，新打水井两眼，并计划再购买大小农具二十五件、大车两辆、骡子一头，此外还有肥料。全组还把卖棉收入的七百万元存进了国家银行，准备明年扩大再生产。　（新华社）
    曲耀离写信给国营天津第二棉纺织厂工人，报告爱国售棉情况，并希望工农紧密团结，努力增产节约。下面就是这封信的原文：国营天津第二棉纺织厂劳动模范王德山、孙桂兰同志并转全体工人同志：
    在天津参观时，蒙你们热烈欢迎和招待，我实在感谢不尽。如今分别已有月余，我时时惦念着你们和你们的生产。我想，纱厂那么大，纱锭那么多，机器转动那么快，要是一分钟接不上棉花，耽误了生产，对国家损失就很大。因此，我回来后在各个干部或群众大会上都着重地宣传了及时把棉花卖给国家的重要。我们互助组就是这样做了的。但是，因为下了一场雨，棉花迟开了几天，组员们都着急得不行。后来摘下花来，赶紧用轧花机白天黑夜不断地轧。到十一月六日，全组已轧好二万二千二百九十六斤。除缴了公粮、预购、捐献共一千四百十七斤外，其余已全部卖给国家。把这一大宗棉花卖了后，我们才稍稍放心。现在我们棉花已收完了，到十一月二十七日已卖了二万五千四百零四斤，现在正动员全村继续卖棉，目前全村已卖棉花占产量的百分之五十。
    今秋收的花不如前时的好，我组便分出好坏出售，并且动员全村都这样做。你嘱咐我们要把花弄得干干净净的，以防把机器弄坏，我们已注意作到了。希望你们好好纺织，送到前方给最可爱的人穿！
    今年我们全村棉花都丰收了，想你们已经在报纸上看到了吧？我想我村所以能够这样丰产，都是共产党、毛主席领导的结果。我希望咱们工人农民要团结得更紧，搞好明年工业农业生产，为实现毛主席的号召“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”而努力。我自己计划明年要创造每亩产一千斤籽棉的丰产新纪录。希望你们也把你们的生产情况告诉我们。
    祝你们生产胜利！
                             曲耀离　十一月三十日
