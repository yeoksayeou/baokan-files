Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 4th: Our frontline reporter reports: Around the time the second item on the agenda of the Panmunjom armistice talks reached an agreement, the American aggressors forced American soldiers and soldiers of their puppet states, who were eager for a quick ceasefire, to continue attacking on the winter battlefield spanning over 200 kilometers. Under the strong blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, many of these forced-to-attack enemy soldiers lost their lives in vain or became crippled.

	On the Western Front, from the 26th to the 28th, enemy forces, ranging from dozens to hundreds of soldiers, continuously invaded the Lichiandong (栗串里) area, one to two kilometers south of the Panmunjom neutral zone. Our army heroically resisted, killing and wounding over 200 enemies. During the battle, our army withdrew from two positions twice, but ultimately recaptured them in counterattacks. The enemy also launched multiple attacks on an unnamed hill seven kilometers northwest of Gaolangpo (高浪浦里), and were forced to retreat after suffering heavy casualties.

	On the Eastern Front, our army also killed and wounded large numbers of invading enemies for days. From the 26th to the 29th, enemy forces, ranging from a battalion to a regiment, continuously attacked the 572.4 height and the heights east of it on the east bank of the North Han River under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft. Our army fired fierce artillery fire, knocking down large numbers of invading enemies on the howling, snowy mountains. Later, when the enemy had just entered several positions from which our army had proactively withdrawn, they were immediately counterattacked by our army. In hand-to-hand combat, another group of enemy soldiers were killed and wounded. According to incomplete statistics from the four days, our army annihilated over 1,300 enemies in this area. On the 30th, when an enemy battalion advanced towards our army's positions in the Neidonggou (内洞沟) area west of Wendengli (文登里), they were bombarded by our army's fierce artillery fire, suffering heavy casualties.

	On the Central Front, on the 26th, our army counterattacked the enemy on an unnamed height northeast of Jinhua (金化) and the 424.2 height, killing and wounding over 120 enemy soldiers in one hour. On the 30th, a group of enemy troops invaded the Zhicun (芝村) area northwest of Jinhua, but were repelled by our fierce artillery fire.

    美侵略者强迫士兵继续进攻遭坚强打击
    我军连日杀伤大批犯敌
    北汉江东岸我军四天歼敌一千三百多人
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社前线记者报道：板门店停战谈判第二项议程达成协议时的前后，美国侵略者强迫渴望迅速停战的美国士兵及其仆从国的士兵，在二百多公里的冬季战场上继续进攻。在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的坚强打击下，这些被迫进攻的敌军士兵又有许多无谓地丧失性命或变成了残废者。
    在西线，二十六日至二十八日，敌军用几十人到几百人不等的兵力，不断进犯板门店中立区以南一、二公里的栗串里地区。我军某部英勇阻击，杀伤敌二百多人。在战斗中我军曾两度撤出两个阵地，最后仍在反击中把它们夺回，敌军也曾向高浪浦里西北七公里的一个无名高地发起多次攻击，在遭受重大伤亡后被迫撤退。
    在东线，我军也连日杀伤大批犯敌。从二十六日至二十九日，敌军曾以一个营到一个团的兵力在炮火、飞机的掩护下不断向北汉江东岸五七二点四高地及其以东高地进攻。我军某部发射出猛烈的炮火，把犯敌大批击倒在寒风呼啸的雪山上。后来，敌军刚刚进入我军主动撤退的几个阵地时立即又受到我军的反击。在短兵相接的搏斗中，敌军又被击毙击伤了一批人。据四天中不完全的统计，该地我军歼敌在一千三百人以上。三十日，敌军一个营向文登里以西内洞沟我军阵地前进时，遭到我军猛烈炮火的轰击，伤亡惨重。
    在中线，二十六日我军某部反击金化东北一个无名高地及四二四点二高地之敌，在一小时内毙伤敌军一百二十多人。三十日，敌军一股向金化西北芝村地区进犯，被我猛烈炮火击退。
