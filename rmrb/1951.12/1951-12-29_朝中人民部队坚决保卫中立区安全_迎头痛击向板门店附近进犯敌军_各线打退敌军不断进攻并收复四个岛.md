Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 27th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have continued to repel successive attacks by the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army in many places along the entire front, especially in the area near Panmunjom, achieving victories in annihilating the enemy's effective strength. On the eastern front, an enemy platoon advanced towards a height west of Mundung-ri at 3:00 AM on the 16th, launching four consecutive charges, all of which were repelled. At 9:00 PM that night, more than two enemy platoons attacked three heights on the east bank of the Bukhan River in separate routes, but were forced to flee after suffering dozens of casualties. On the 18th and 19th, two to three enemy platoons continued to attack a height in that area, but were all repelled, with the enemy suffering more than 50 casualties. On the central front, two enemy companies launched a fierce attack on a height west of Jujahyundong, northeast of Kimhwa, at 5:30 AM on the 16th, launching eight charges in succession, all of which were repelled by our army's fierce firepower. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 100 casualties. On the 17th, more than one American company, under the cover of several tanks, attacked several heights east and southeast of Kimcheng, but were also repelled by our army, with the enemy suffering more than 50 casualties. On the western front, on the night of the 18th, an enemy company advanced towards our army's position north of Changdan, but collapsed after suffering a heavy blow from our army. The next morning, an enemy platoon again attempted to sneak into that area, but was quickly repelled by our army. In recent days, the enemy has continued to launch provocative attacks near the Panmunjom neutral zone. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies, resolutely defending the safety of the neutral zone for the armistice negotiations, continue to strike at the invading enemy. On the morning of the 16th, two enemy companies attempted to sneak into our army's position west of the Sajon River, and launched two fierce attacks on our army's position in Cangnae-ri, south of Panmunjom, but were severely damaged by our dense firepower and fled in panic. At 2:00 AM on the 18th, an enemy platoon advanced towards our army's position in Ryongdae-ri, about eleven kilometers south of Panmunjom. Our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, and the enemy fled in panic. On the west coast, a unit of our coastal defense forces also cleared out the enemy entrenched on Yukdo and Chudo, south of Haeju, annihilating more than 150 enemies. Cheongyang Island and Woong Island at the mouth of the Daedong River have also been recovered by our army.
