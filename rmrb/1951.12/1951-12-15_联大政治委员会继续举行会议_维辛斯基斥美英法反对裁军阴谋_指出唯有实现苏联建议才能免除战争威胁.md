Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 14th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee, after a seven-day recess, continued its meeting on the 11th and 12th to discuss the proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, and France for “regulation, limitation, and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments” and the Soviet Union’s amendments to this proposal.

Since the Political Committee passed a resolution on November 30th to establish a subcommittee composed of the President of the General Assembly and the representatives of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to consider the three-nation proposal and the Soviet amendments, the subcommittee held multiple meetings over ten days from December 1st to 10th. The President of the General Assembly and Chairman of the subcommittee, Nasrollah Entezam, presented a memorandum to the Political Committee meeting on the 11th, summarizing the work of the subcommittee, stating that the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France had reached some agreement on certain points in their proposals, but the differences on the most important issues remained unresolved. The memorandum pointed out that both sides agreed on certain general objectives and agreed to establish a new Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission under the Security Council to replace the original separate Atomic Energy Commission and Conventional Armaments Commission. The two sides also reached some agreement on the tasks of this new commission, but there were significant differences of opinion on the principles and methods to be followed by the new commission in completing these tasks.

According to the memorandum, the three nations continued to adhere to their original proposals in the subcommittee, attempting to replace disarmament with determining armament "levels" and indefinitely delaying the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union expressed its disagreement with the three nations' position in the subcommittee and reiterated its clear and concrete plan, stipulating that the United Nations General Assembly immediately declare an unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establish international supervision for the implementation of this ban. The Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission must formulate measures in a very short period of time to ensure that the United Nations General Assembly's decisions on the prohibition of atomic weapons, the cessation of atomic weapons production, the use of already manufactured atomic bombs solely for civilian purposes, and the establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of these regulations are implemented.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, made a lengthy speech at the meeting on the 12th, summarizing the work of the subcommittee. He pointed out that the work of the subcommittee had achieved some positive results, eliminating some differences of opinion on less important issues. However, on some of the most important issues, on issues that people all over the world are waiting for decisions to be made on, the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France remain fundamentally the same. Vyshinsky pointed out that the reason why the three nations oppose the Soviet proposal, oppose the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international supervision for this ban, and oppose the five major powers each reducing their armaments and armed forces by one-third within a year is because they hope to continue the arms expansion movement. This explains why they are actually unwilling to convene a world disarmament conference.

Vyshinsky compared the Soviet proposals with the recommendations in the three-nation proposal and criticized the arguments used by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to justify their positions. He proved once again that only by implementing the Soviet proposals is it possible to effectively free the people of all countries from the threat of war and guarantee the security of all countries and their peaceful cooperation.

In the meetings on the 11th and 12th, only the representatives of Britain and France among the countries of the US-British bloc spoke to defend the positions of the three countries, and no representatives of other countries requested to speak.

    联大政治委员会继续举行会议
    维辛斯基斥美英法反对裁军阴谋
    指出唯有实现苏联建议才能免除战争威胁
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会经过七天休会后，于十一、十二日继续举行会议，讨论美英法三国所提出的“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的提案以及苏联对这个提案所提出的修正案。
    自从政治委员会在十一月三十日通过成立由大会主席和美英苏法四国代表组成的小组委员会来考虑三国提案和苏联修正案的决议以后，小组委员会在十二月一日到十日十天中举行了多次会议。大会主席兼小组委员会主席纳孚十一日向政治委员会会议提出了一项备忘录，总结小组委员会的工作说，苏联和美英法三国之间已就它们建议中的某些点取得某些协议，但在最重要的问题上的分歧仍然没有消除。备忘录指出，双方同意某些总的目标，同意在安全理事会下设立一个新的原子能与常规军备委员会，以代替原来分立的原子能委员会和常规军备委员会。双方并就这个新委员会的任务取得了某些协议，然而对于新委员会完成这些任务时所应遵守的原则和方法，双方的意见有很大的分歧。
    根据备忘录，三国在小组委员会中继续坚持它们原来的建议，企图以确定军备“水平”来代替裁减军备，并无限期地拖延禁止原子武器。苏联在小组委员会中表示不同意三国的立场，并再度提出它的明确而具体的计划，规定联合国大会立即宣布无条件地禁止原子武器并对这项禁令的实施建立国际监督，原子能与常规军备委员会必须在很短时间内拟定措施，确保联合国大会关于禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、把已经制成的原子弹只用于民用目的以及建立严格的国际管制以监督这些规定的执行情形的各项决定得以执行。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十二日会议上作了长篇发言，综述小组委员会的工作。他指出，小组委员会的工作取得了某些积极成果，消除了在比较不重要的问题上的某些意见分歧。然而，在一些最重要的问题上，在一些全世界人民都在期待作出决定的问题上，苏联和美英法三国双方之间的分歧基本上依然如故。维辛斯基指出，三国之所以反对苏联的建议，反对禁止原子武器并对这项禁令建立严格的国际监督，反对五大国在一年之内各裁减军备和武装部队三分之一，是因为它们希望继续进行扩张军备运动。这就说明了他们实际上是不愿召开世界裁减军备会议的。
    维辛斯基对苏联的建议和三国提案中的建议加以比较，并批评美英法三国代表用来为他们的立场辩解的论据。他再次证明了，唯有实现苏联的建议，才有可能事实上使各国人民免除战争的威胁，保证各国的安全和它们之间的和平合作。
    在十一、十二日会议中，美英集团国家中只有英法二国代表发言为三国的立场辩解，其他国家代表都没有要求发言。
