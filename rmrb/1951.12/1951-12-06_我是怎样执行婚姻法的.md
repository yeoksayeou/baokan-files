How I Implemented the Marriage Law
    As told by Song Yuzhi, Written by Ai Fang

    My mother was forced to hang herself by my father. When I was nine, my father sent me to the Wang family to be a child bride. I deeply understood the suffering of women. Later, in the struggle against the local bullies, I joined the Communist Party. After everyone elected me as the chairman of the Sha Wangdian Township Farmers' Association (Sha Wangdian Township belongs to Minquan County, Henan Province). Wherever I went to work in a village, I always thought about women's affairs.

    Our township has twelve villages, with over two thousand two hundred people. After inspection, from liberation (autumn of 1949) until now, no woman has been forced to death or beaten to death. However, there are still constant quarrels and instances of anger, which we blame on our insufficient propaganda.

    After the Marriage Law was issued, several of us township cadres studied it first. The township finance and grain committee member read it out, and everyone discussed it clause by clause. We also talked about the Marriage Law at mass meetings. Most people said it was good to implement the Marriage Law: mutual consent, equality between men and women, no arguing, no getting angry. Some people didn't understand it, but since the Marriage Law was issued and women were organized, no one dared to oppress women like in the past. Some mothers-in-law and husbands still try to upset their daughters-in-law; this must be resolved, otherwise small matters can escalate. For example, the mother-in-law of Li Kejian's family in Benzhuang (Qu Zhuang) abused her daughter-in-law. Two years ago, her daughter-in-law jumped into a well but was saved. At that time, the daughter-in-law went back to her mother's home to complain, but her mother said: "You are a member of the Li family in life, and a ghost of the Li family in death." Look how feudal! Now, more than two years later, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are still not getting along. We criticized the mother-in-law at their family meeting. We also consulted with the whole family and separated their households so they could live in peace from then on.

    The brother's wife of Wang Huali's family in Li Yue Village is a widow. Her son is already grown up and is a member of the Communist Youth League and has already married. However, this widow gave birth to a child. The son and daughter-in-law both have opinions about this matter, and if it is not handled well, it could involve two lives. We explained it to her son and also educated her, helping her to give the child she gave birth to to someone else to raise, so that neither the adult nor the child would have any problems.

    We also helped the masses solve some marriage and divorce problems. Li Chuanqin and his wife were not getting along and both wanted a divorce, and they registered in the district. At that time, the woman's family didn't want the child, fearing it would be a burden. Both parties agreed to give both children to the man's family. But after the woman left, she missed her children so much that she became mentally unstable. We discussed it with Li Chuanqin and gave a little girl to the woman, and the woman's illness improved. Li Chuanqin then fell in love with Wang Yuzhong. Wang Yuzhong is a young woman from the village. Both of them were interested in each other. But Wang Yuzhong's mother was unwilling. Because this old woman was alone and wanted her daughter to work for her. Can we stop a daughter from getting married because of work? We talked to her again and again, and since she had no reason, she made up a story, saying: "There are also party members and Youth League members in the village, why not choose a party member or Youth League member to marry, but only Li Chuanqin?" Although Li Chuanqin is not a party member or Youth League member, he is very active in his work and has done a great job in helping with broadcasting and propaganda in the village. Later, the old woman agreed. After Li Chuanqin and Wang Yuzhong got married, they were even more energetic in their work and production.

    Those who forced people to death or beat people to death should be killed or punished according to the law. No women in our township have been abused to death, but during the Party rectification in the county, everyone reflected and heard comrades from other places talk about many such things. In Huatoumiao Village, a woman committed suicide last year. In Qin Jinying's family in Niu Zhai, the mother-in-law and Qin Jinying abused the daughter-in-law, beating, scolding, not giving her food or drink, and locking her in the room for two years, torturing her to death. Can such cases be put aside? Some people said:

    "We've seen thousands upon thousands of daughters-in-law die, but we haven't seen a mother-in-law go to jail." This is really not right, we should show some examples to everyone.

    Cadres must think of many ways to liberate women. Women must work actively and strive for production. In the past, the women in our township contributed a lot of strength, in anti-hegemony, rent reduction, land reform, land investigation, and production quotas, everything was inseparable from women. In many of these tasks, women were always in the lead. Even in production, women don't let anyone else take the lead. Women go to the fields. Things like hoeing, women are a little behind; but things like picking cotton and harvesting cotton branches, men are not as good as women. In our village's mutual aid groups, two groups are led by women, and they lead very well. I think women elsewhere are the same. Women have put in so much effort, why are they still being abused? They are being abused, why not help them liberate?

    In the past, the women in our township were active in their work and diligent in production. In the future, they must be even more active and diligent, striving for equality and striving for liberation.

    我是怎样执行婚姻法的
    宋玉芝口述  艾方记
    我母亲是被我父亲逼得吊死的。我九岁那年，父亲把我送到汪家当童养媳。我很知道妇女的痛苦。以后在反对恶霸的斗争中，我加入了共产党。大家又选我当沙王店乡农民协会主席（沙王店乡属河南省民权县）。无论到那个村去工作，我总想着妇女的事。
    我们这个乡，十二个村，二千二百多人。检查了
    一下，从解放（一九四九年秋）到现在，没有一个妇女被逼死、打死。就是打架、生气的事，还不断有，这还是怨我们宣传的不到。
    婚姻法下来以后，我们几个乡干部，先进行了学习。乡财粮委员念，大家一条一条地讨论。在群众会上，也都讲了婚姻法。多数人都说实行婚姻法好：双方自愿，男女平等，不吵嘴，不生气。有的思想不通，可是婚姻法下来了，妇女组织起来了，谁也不敢像过去那样压迫妇女了。有些婆婆、丈夫，总还想法给媳妇点气吃；这得解决，要不，小事就能越来越大。像本庄（曲庄）李克俭家的婆婆虐待儿媳妇，两年以前，她儿媳妇跳过井，又救活了。当时儿媳妇受了婆婆的气，到娘家去诉诉冤，谁知她娘说：“你活是李家的人，死是李家的鬼。”你看，多么封建！现在二年多了，婆媳还是不和。我们在她们的家庭会上批评了婆婆。又和她们全家商量，给她们分开家，以后都安生了。
    李岳村王化礼家的兄弟媳妇是寡妇。儿子已经很大了，是个青年团员，已经娶了媳妇。可是，这寡妇又生了小孩。对这件事，儿子、媳妇都有意见，要是搞不好，关系着两条人命。我们给她儿子解释了解释，也向她本人进行了教育，帮助她把生下的孩子送给别人养活，这样大人孩子都没有出毛病。
    我们也帮助群众解决些结婚和离婚的问题。李传勤和她媳妇，两口子不好，都愿意离婚，也到区里登记了。当时女家不愿要小孩，怕赘脚，双方协议，把两个孩子都给了男家。可是女的走了以后，想她的小孩，直想得疯疯颠颠的。我们就和李传勤商量，把一个小女孩送给了女方，女方的病也好了。李传勤又和王裕中恋爱。王裕中是本村的闺女。两个人，你有心，我有意。可是王裕中的母亲不愿意。因为这老婆婆没有人，想叫闺女跟她做活。还能因为做活的事，挡住闺女结婚吗？我们一次又一次地和她讲，她没有理讲，就编了一套，说：“全村也有党员，也有团员，怎不选个党员、团员结婚，单选个李传勤？”李传勤虽说不是党员、团员，工作很积极，在村里帮助广播宣传工作，很有成绩。后来老婆婆同意了。李传勤和王裕中结婚以后，工作、生产都更带劲了。
    那些逼死人、打死人的，该杀的杀，该办罪的办罪。我们乡里没有被虐待死的妇女，可是在县里整党的时候，大家反省，听别处的同志讲出了不少这样事。花头庙村，去年有一个妇女自杀。牛砦秦金营家，婆婆和秦金营虐待媳妇，打、骂、不给吃、不给喝，关在房里，一关二年，活活把媳妇折磨死了。像这样的案子搁起来行吗？有的人就说啦：
    “只见媳妇死了上千上万，没见婆婆坐牢坐监。”这真是不行，应该拿些样子给大家看看。
    干部要想很多办法，解放妇女。妇女要积极工作，努力生产。过去我们乡的妇女出的力很大，反霸、减租、土地改革、查田、定产，样样离不了妇女。不论在那个工作当中很多妇女都是跑到头里。就是生产，妇女也不让人，妇女都下地。像锄地这样活，女的还差点；像拾花、打花杈，男的不如女的了。我们村上的互助组，有两个组都是妇女当组长，她们领导得很好。我想别处的妇女一样。妇女出了这么大的力，为什么还虐待她们？她们受了虐待，为什么不帮助她们解放？
    过去我们乡的妇女，工作积极，生产努力，今后还要更加积极，更加努力，争取平等，争取解放。
