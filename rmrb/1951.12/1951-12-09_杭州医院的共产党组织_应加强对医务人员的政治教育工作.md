    The Communist Party Organization of Hangzhou Hospital
    Should Strengthen the Political Education of Medical Personnel

    Editor: The phenomenon of the Communist Party organization of Hangzhou Hospital neglecting the political education of the masses is very serious. During the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the Party organization completely handed over the political education work to the study groups. Although medical personnel also put forward slogans of increasing production and making donations, and established patriotic covenants, most of the donation plans fell through, and the patriotic covenants were just empty clauses and did not play a role. There are still "factional divisions and sectarian biases" among medical personnel. They do not discuss treatment with each other. For the same disease, Doctor A uses a new method of treatment, and Doctor B uses an old method of treatment. The effect is obviously different, but neither is willing to learn from the other. Some medical personnel even retaliate against patients who dare to offer opinions by stopping medication. The Communist Party organization of Hangzhou Hospital is turning a blind eye to these phenomena and letting them go unchecked. The Communist Party organization of Hangzhou Hospital has also relaxed its leadership over the trade union and the Communist Youth League. The trade union has no study system or recreational activities for a long time. It has the name of a trade union but not the substance. The Communist Youth League has a tendency towards closed-doorism, and there is not a single member among the young doctors and nurses. The Communist Party organization of Hangzhou Hospital has done very little to educate and help the labor models of the hospital. As a result, the Communist Party organization of the hospital has also shown weakness and a lack of combat effectiveness.

    I suggest that the Communist Party organization of Hangzhou Hospital strengthen the political education of medical personnel and correct this chaotic phenomenon.

### 杭州医院的共产党组织  应加强对医务人员的政治教育工作

    杭州医院的共产党组织
    应加强对医务人员的政治教育工作
    编辑同志：杭州医院的共产党组织，忽视群众政治教育工作的现象很严重。在抗美援朝运动中，党的组织把政治教育工作，完全交给学习小组去作。当时医务人员中虽然也提出增产捐献口号，订立爱国公约，但捐献计划大部落空，爱国公约也只是空洞的条文，不起作用。医务人员中仍有“学派之分、门户之见”。他们在治疗上互不研讨。同样一种病，甲医生用新法治疗，乙医生用旧法治疗，效果显然不同，但都不愿彼此学习。有的医务人员甚至对敢于提意见的病人施行报复——停药。对这些现象，杭州医院的共产党组织，竟然熟视无睹，听之任之。杭州医院的共产党组织对工会、青年团也放松领导。工会长期没有学习制度，没有文娱活动，有工会之名，无工会之实。青年团有关门主义倾向，在青年医生和护士中间就没有一个团员。杭州医院的共产党组织对于医院的劳动模范的教育和帮助很少。这样，医院的共产党组织也就表现了软弱无力，缺乏战斗性。
    我建议杭州医院的共产党组织，加强对医务人员的政治教育工作，纠正这种混乱现象。    汤话实
