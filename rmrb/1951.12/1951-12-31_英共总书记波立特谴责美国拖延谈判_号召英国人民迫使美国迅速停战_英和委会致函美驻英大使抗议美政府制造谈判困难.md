Xinhua News Agency, December 29th Dispatch from London by Telecommunications Agency: British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt called on the British people, under the leadership of the working class, to "unite and use their great strength to bring the Korean War to an immediate end, without further delay." In a conversation with a Telecommunications Agency reporter on the 28th, Pollitt pointed out that unless the people take this action, "the American warmongers will continue to delay the armistice, and even after the armistice agreement is signed, they will carry out new acts of aggression against the Korean and Chinese people." Pollitt said, "This is the lesson learned from the negotiations so far." He said, "If the American side had even a little desire for peace, a ceasefire could have been achieved before Christmas. The representatives of Korea and China have repeatedly strived for an agreement, but on every issue, the arrogant and belligerent American generals have acted as if victors were trying to force the vanquished to accept their terms." Pollitt continued, "If this tactic continues, a peaceful resolution is impossible, because the Korean people have not been defeated. On the contrary, they have demonstrated unparalleled heroism in the face of all the terrible killing weapons of modern warfare and all kinds of brutal and barbaric acts; they have defeated the attempt to conquer Korea and use Korea as a base for war against China." Pollitt said, "It is a sin to send British children to fight and die for the American capitalists' war of aggression. It is also a sin that the United States refuses to agree to reasonable ceasefire terms, causing British prisoners of war to be delayed in returning home." Pollitt concluded, "For the sake of the prisoners of war, for the sake of the children in Korea far from their families facing the harsh winter, for the friendship between the British people and the people of Korea and China, and for world peace, the British people must take action to strive for an armistice, bring the British children home, and seek a just and lasting peace based on the principle of recognizing the Korean people's right to determine their own destiny."

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th Dispatch from London by TASS on December 27th: The Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee published a letter to the US Ambassador to London on the 25th. The letter was signed by Jones, the Secretary of the British Peace Committee, and its content is as follows:

"I am instructed by our Executive Committee to bring to your attention the growing anxiety throughout our country about the prolonged and unsuccessful conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations. Our committee immediately convened a meeting to discuss the Korean issue after the news of the exchange of prisoner-of-war lists was published.

"After studying the current situation and the reports from branches across the country, the British Peace Committee deeply feels that people from all walks of life now deeply believe that the difficulties in failing to achieve a Korean armistice for so long are almost entirely caused by the attitude of the American negotiators.

"The American representatives have repeatedly made capricious new or far-fetched demands during the negotiation process, and whenever the situation seems to be closer to an agreement, they raise new or far-fetched demands with a very overbearing and unreasonable attitude. All of this obviously leads many people to believe that the United States hopes to maintain the tension and use violence to force others to listen to its will. According to the information we have received, especially from industrial areas, this is causing a significant increase in anti-American sentiment throughout Britain, because people generally believe that Britain is not participating in the negotiations, but for the sake of the United States' policies, Britons are losing their lives unnecessarily and British prisoners of war are being prevented from returning home.

"I am instructed by our committee to ask you to report this situation to the US government and to the President himself, urging them to pay attention. I ask you to explain to them that only if the US government changes its attitude towards the issue of peaceful negotiations; only if the US government is willing to discuss all issues in the spirit of mutual concession and allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of these issues; only if the US government realizes that its forcing our country to accept policies and burdens that directly violate our national interests will ultimately backfire on the United States itself – only in this way can the relationship between our two peoples be improved. As long as the United States continues to attempt to force Britain to accept the various policies it advocates, good relations between the two countries will be impossible.

"Whether the Korean armistice negotiations can succeed and whether the five major powers can hold negotiations to resolve overall issues, a large part of the British people will judge the intentions of the United States based on these two points. This is a current test. The policies of a Korean armistice and holding five-power negotiations will conform to the sincere wishes of the British people, and we firmly believe that this must also conform to the wishes of the American people."

    英共总书记波立特谴责美国拖延谈判
    号召英国人民迫使美国迅速停战
    英和委会致函美驻英大使抗议美政府制造谈判困难
    【新华社二十九日讯】据电通社伦敦讯：英国共产党总书记波立特号召英国人民在工人阶级领导下“团结起来，用他们伟大的力量来使朝鲜战争立刻结束，不再拖延”。波立特二十八日在对电通社记者谈话时指出：除非人民采取这种行动，“美国的战争贩子都会继续拖延停战，而且在停战协定签订以后，他们也会对朝鲜和中国人民进行新的侵略行动”。波立特说：“这是从迄今为止的谈判中所得到的教训。”他说：“只要美国人方面有一点点谋求和平的愿望，早就可以在圣诞节前实现停火了。朝鲜和中国的代表几次三番竭力要谋取协议，但是在每一个问题上，傲慢好斗的美国将领们的一举一动，都表现得好像战胜者在企图强迫战败国接受他们的条件似的。”波立特接着说：“如果这种策略继续下去，是不可能获得和平解决的；因为朝鲜人民并没有被打败。相反地，他们在现代战争的一切可怕的杀人武器之前、在各种残暴野蛮的行为之前表现了无比的英勇；他们已击败了妄想征服朝鲜并用朝鲜作为对中国作战的基地的企图。”波立特说：“把英国孩子派去为美国大资本家的侵略战争打仗、送命，是一个罪恶。美国拒绝同意合理的停火条件、使英国战俘到现在还迟迟不能回家，这也是一个罪恶。”波立特最后说：“为了战俘们，为了那些身在朝鲜、远离亲人、面临严冬的孩子们，为了英国人民和朝中两国人民之间的友谊，为了世界和平，英国人民必须行动起来，力争停战，使英国的孩子们回家，并根据承认朝鲜人民自行决定他们自己的命运的原则谋取公正而持久的和平。”
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十七日讯：英国和平委员会执行委员会二十五日发表了致美国驻伦敦大使的信。这封信由英国和平委员会书记琼斯署名，内容如下：
    “我奉我们执行委员会之命，请你注意，朝鲜停战谈判拖了这样久一直没有能够圆满结束，已引起我们全国越来越大的焦虑。当双方交换战俘名单的消息发表之后，我们的委员会马上召集了会议，讨论朝鲜问题。
    “英国和平委员会研究了目前的局势和全国各地分会的报告之后，深深感觉到现在社会各阶层人民都深信，朝鲜停战迟迟没有能够实现，其中的困难几乎完全是美国谈判代表一向的态度所造成的。
    “美国代表在谈判过程中反复无常地提出新的或牵强附会的要求，每当情形看来好像比较接近协议的时候，他们就提出新的或牵强附会的要求，而且态度非常横蛮，不讲道理。这一切显然使得许多人认为，美国希望维持紧张局面，并以暴力叫别人听从它的意旨。根据我们所接到的消息，特别是工业地区的消息，这正在使英国全国的反美情绪显著增长，因为人们普遍地认为，英国没有参加谈判，而为了美国的政策的利益，英国人却在无谓地丢掉性命，英国战俘被阻不能回家。
    “我奉我们委员会之命，要求你把这种情况转告美国政府，并转告总统本人，促请他们注意。我要求你向他们说明，唯有美国政府改变对谈判和平问题的态度；唯有美国政府方面愿意本着互相让步的精神讨论一切问题，让中华人民共和国的代表参加这些问题的讨论；唯有美国政府认识到，它强迫我国接受直接违反我国民族利益的政策和负担，最终必将使美国自食其果——唯有这样，才可能改善我们两国人民之间的关系。只要美国一天仍然企图迫使英国接受它所主张的种种政策，两国之间也就一天不可能产生良好的关系。
    “朝鲜停战谈判是否能成功，五大国是否能为解决全面问题举行谈判，很大一部分英国人将根据这两点来判断美国的意图，这是当前的一个考验。朝鲜停战和举行五大国谈判的政策将符合英国人民的衷心愿望，我们深信这也一定符合美国人民的愿望。”
