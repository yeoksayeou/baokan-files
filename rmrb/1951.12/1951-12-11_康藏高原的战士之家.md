    The People's Liberation Army soldiers living on the Kangzang Plateau, more than 3,000 meters above sea level, have built their own happy homes in a land where the air is thin and the wind, snow, rain, and hail are capricious.
    These happy homes are composed of hundreds of cave dwellings arranged in rows. In front of each row of cave dwellings is a clean and flat sidewalk. Some sidewalks are also planted with many small trees. The soldiers compare it to a neat and clean residential area in an inland city, and they praise it with a thumbs-up as the first-class residence on the Kangzang Plateau.
    Soldiers of a certain unit built an eight-story building on a mountain. The entire mountain was dug into cave dwellings by the soldiers, with a total of eight floors from bottom to top. This building has stairs, sidewalks, clean bedrooms and dining rooms, well-lit clubs and offices, and spacious courtyards. Inside and outside the courtyards, the soldiers also planted flowers and plants unique to the Kangzang Plateau. The soldiers love the fruits of their labor and affectionately call it the "Kangzang Plateau Building."
    The soldiers planted many trees on the mountains around the residential area. There are also many vegetable gardens in the residential area. When the soldiers came to the Kangzang Plateau from the interior of the motherland, they brought various vegetable seeds in a planned way. Now, the soldiers' vegetable gardens have achieved a bumper harvest. A radish weighs twelve pounds, a spinach plant weighs four pounds, and a potato weighs two pounds.
    Each cave dwelling has a mud-made kang (heated platform bed) and a square table. The soldiers whitewashed the four walls, windows, and both sides of the gate of the cave dwellings with the bluish-white soil of the plateau. The cave dwellings are well-lit, clean and tidy. The soldiers' backpacks, picks, bowls, chopsticks, etc. are neatly placed in designated places. The soldiers write the conditions of the patriotic labor competition, the study plan, and the code of conduct neatly in red soil on the bluish-white walls. On both sides of the entrance to the cave dwellings, the soldiers wrote couplets in various colors of soil, such as "Strengthen Resistance Against America and Aid Korea, Build the Border of the Motherland," "Defend the Border of the Motherland, Build the Kangzang Plateau," and "Unite with the Tibetan People, Complete the Construction Task." On the lintels, they wrote horizontal inscriptions such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Love the Motherland," and "Build Tibet."
    Every morning, the soldiers leave their homes, carrying picks and other production tools, and head to the construction areas. On the plateau, the weather sometimes changes several times a day. Often, on a clear noon, patches of dark clouds will fly over, and the mountains will immediately be raging with strong winds and heavy snow. The soldiers persevere in building roads, bridges, and other projects in this unpredictable climate. When soldiers build roads on snow-capped mountains, their hat brims are often covered with an inch of ice. They also often drive bridge piles in the cold current of minus ten degrees Celsius. The soldiers are determined to turn the Kangzang Plateau into a place as beautiful as Soviet Siberia. When they see colorful pictures of Siberia printed in Soviet pictorials, they encourage each other: "The past Siberia was also desolate. Look, now on the Stalin Highway in Siberia, there are trucks carrying goods and beautiful coaches every day." Siberia, transformed from desolation to prosperity, has become the soldiers' vision for building the Kangzang Plateau.
    In the evening, the soldiers return home from the construction area. Some go to the club or outdoor stage to participate in cultural and recreational activities, while others go to the stadium to play basketball, jump on the wooden horse, or do single-bar exercises. After engaging in sufficient recreational activities, the soldiers return to the clean and warm kang to sleep comfortably.
    On festivals and holidays, the soldiers invite Tibetans to their homes for a get-together. The Tibetan people and the soldiers are already as close as a family. In the soldiers' homes, they play musical instruments, dance various dances, and sing Tibetan songs to their heart's content, praising Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army. The Tibetans take the soldiers' hands and teach them to dance the String Dance, the Tibetan Dance, and the Arrow-leading Dance; the soldiers also enthusiastically teach the Tibetans to dance the Construction Dance, the Pick Dance, the Red Flag Dance, and the Resist-America-Aid-Korea Dance. At ordinary times, the Tibetans often bring bouquets of wildflowers picked from the wild to the soldiers' homes to help them decorate their homes. The soldiers also give tea brought from the interior of the motherland to the Tibetans.
    "Defend the border of the motherland, build the border of the motherland!" The People's Liberation Army soldiers are full of boundless confidence and are determined to work with the Tibetan people to turn the border of the motherland into a happy paradise. (Xinhua News Agency)

    康藏高原的战士之家
    生活在拔海三千公尺以上康藏高原上的人民解放军战士们，在空气稀薄，风、雪、雨、雹变化无常的天地里，建设了自己的快乐家园。
    这快乐的家园是成百个一排一排的窑洞组成的。每一排的窑洞面前，都有一条清洁而平坦的人行道。有些人行道的两旁，还栽着很多小树。战士们把它比做内地城市里的整齐而又清洁的住宅区，他们翘起大拇指把它夸耀为康藏高原上第一等的住宅。
    某部战士们在一座山上修建了一座八层大楼。整个一座山，都被战士们挖成窑洞，从底到顶共有八层。这座大楼有楼梯，有人行道，有清洁的寝室和饭厅，有光线充足的俱乐部和办公室，还有宽敞的院子。院子里外战士们还种植了康藏高原上特有的花草。战士们热爱自己的劳动果实，亲切地称它为“康藏高原大楼”。
    住宅区周围的山上，战士们栽上了许多树。住宅区里还有很多菜园。战士们从祖国内地到康藏高原来的时候，有计划地带来了各种菜种。现在，战士们的菜园已经获得了丰收。一个萝卜有十二斤重，一棵菠菜有四斤重，一个马铃薯有两斤重。
    每一个窑洞里，有一个泥做的炕和一张方桌。战士们用高原上青白色的土粉刷了窑洞的四壁、窗口和大门两旁。窑洞里光线充足，清洁整齐。战士们的背包、洋镐、碗筷等都整齐地放在规定的地方。战士们把爱国主义劳动竞赛的条件、学习计划和生活公约，用红色的土端正地写在青白色的墙壁上。在窑洞门口两旁，战士们用各种颜色的土写着“加强抗美援朝、建设祖国边疆”“捍卫祖国边疆、建设康藏高原”“团结藏族人民、完成修建任务”等对联。在门头上，他们写上“毛主席万岁”“热爱祖国”“建设西藏”等横额。
    每天早上，战士们走出自己的家，扛着洋镐和其它生产工具，奔向修建工程区。高原上有时一天之内晴雨变换数次，往往在万里晴空的正午，突然会有一片片的黑云飞卷过来，山上马上就狂风怒号，大雪纷飞。战士们就在这种气候变化无常的情况下坚持着修建公路、桥梁和其它工程。战士们在雪山上修建公路时，帽檐上常常结了一寸长的冰。他们也往往在零下十度的寒流中去打桥桩。战士们决心把康藏高原变为像苏联西伯利亚一样美好。他们看到苏联画报上印有西伯利亚的五彩图片，就互相鼓舞着：“过去的西伯利亚也很荒凉。大家看，现在西伯利亚的斯大林公路上，天天走着载货汽车和漂亮的客车。”从荒凉变为繁荣的西伯利亚，成为战士们建设康藏高原的远景。
    晚上，战士们从修建区回到家里，有的到俱乐部里或露天舞台上去参加文化娱乐活动，有的到体育场上去打篮球、跳木马或翻单杠。战士们在进行了充分的娱乐活动后，就回到清洁温暖的炕上舒适地睡觉。
    战士们在节日和假日，都邀请藏民到自己的家里来联欢。藏族人民和战士们已经亲热得像一家人了。他们在战士的家里，奏着乐器，跳着各种舞蹈，尽情地高唱藏曲，歌颂毛主席和解放军。藏民们拉着战士们的手，教战士们跳弦子舞、西藏舞、引箭舞；战士们也热情地教藏民们跳修建舞、洋镐舞、红旗舞、抗美援朝舞。平时，藏民时常把一束束从野外采来的鲜花送到战士们的家里，帮助他们装饰家园。战士们也把从祖国内地带去的茶叶送给藏民。
    “捍卫祖国边疆，建设祖国边疆！”解放军战士们充满了无限的信心，决心和藏族人民一起把祖国边疆变为幸福的乐园。（新华社）
