Beijing Retail Company Dispatcher
Ba Yushi Embezzles by Selling Public Property
Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Files Public Prosecution

The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution against Ba Yushi, a dispatcher at the Beijing Retail Company, for illegally selling state assets. Ba Yushi previously served as a lieutenant staff officer, adjutant in the puppet army, as well as a clerk in the "Beiping Garrison Telecommunications Inspection Section" of the Kuomintang secret service organization, puppet army battalion commander, deputy regiment commander, regimental chief of staff, and leader of a commando team. He was extravagant and led a corrupt life, deeply influenced by bad habits. After the liberation of Beijing, Ba Yushi infiltrated the Beijing Retail Company as a dispatcher. He did not change his bad habits, led a corrupt life, womanized, and used his position to steal and sell public property for embezzlement. Since June of this year, Ba Yushi has been stealing new hemp sacks from the company and selling them to street "drum beating" peddlers for 12,000 yuan, 15,000 yuan, or 35,000 yuan each, profiting from the sales. On the other hand, he bought back old and broken hemp sacks for about 5,000 yuan each to make up for the number of stolen sacks. By early September, Ba Yushi had stolen and sold a total of 200 public sacks, and also pocketed 88,900 yuan of union welfare funds.

In order to ensure state property, the interests of the people, and to restore the prestige of the People's Government, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, after repeated inspections, confirmed that Ba Yushi's crimes were irrefutable and has filed a public prosecution according to law. The defendant Ba has been handed over to the Beijing Municipal People's Court for handling.

    北京零售公司调拨员
    巴雨时盗卖公物进行贪污
    北京市人民检察署提起公诉
    北京市人民检察署对盗卖国家资财的北京市零售公司调拨员巴雨时依法提起公诉。巴雨时过去曾当过伪军中尉参谋、副官及国民党特务组织“北平行营电讯检查科”文书、伪军营长、副团长、团参谋长、突击队队长等职。他挥霍浪费，生活腐化，受恶习气熏染极深。北京解放后，巴雨时混入北京市零售公司任调拨员，恶习不改，生活腐化，玩弄妇女，利用职位盗卖公物，进行贪污。自今年六月起，巴雨时一方面把公司的新大麻袋偷出，用每条一万二千元、一万五千元，或三万五千元的价格卖给过街“打鼓”小贩，从中谋利，另一方面又用每条五千元左右的价格买回破旧麻袋来补足盗卖的数目。到九月初，巴雨时前后共盗卖公家麻袋二百条，还把工会福利金八万八千九百元吞入私囊。
    北京市人民检察署为确保国家的财产、人民的利益，和挽回人民政府的威信，经过反复检察，证实巴雨时罪证确凿，已依法提起公诉。巴犯已被移交北京市人民法院处理。    李　谢
