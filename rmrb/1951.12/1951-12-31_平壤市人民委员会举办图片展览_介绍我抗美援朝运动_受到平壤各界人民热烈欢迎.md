Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th. The Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee held "China's Resistance Against US Aggression and Aid Korea Photo Exhibition" in 98 locations on city streets in November and December. The photos are mainly divided into two parts: one part shows the magnificent unfolding of the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, including the entry of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army into Korea for combat and the Chinese people's enthusiastic support for the front lines through increased production and donations; the other part shows how the Korean people's leader, General Kim Il-sung, and countless Korean patriots engaged in heroic struggles against the Japanese invaders alongside the Chinese people in Chinese territory in the past. The democratic propaganda offices in various neighborhoods of Pyongyang convened meetings of residents to explain the content of the pictures in detail, in order to deeply publicize the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people.

The exhibition was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the Pyongyang area. Thousands upon thousands of Pyongyang's soldiers and civilians, regardless of enemy air raids and the cold weather, flocked to visit. When they saw photos of the Chinese people enthusiastically supporting the front lines and the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting the enemy bravely side by side, they praised the internationalist spirit of the Chinese people.

Tang Yunshi, a model female worker at a state-owned factory in Pyongyang, said after seeing the exhibition: "The spirit of the Chinese worker brothers 'taking the factory as a battlefield' deeply moved me. I am determined to learn from the Chinese worker brothers, step up production with all my strength, support the front lines, and force the enemy to accept a just peace." Choi Nam-san, a soldier of the People's Army, said with confidence while looking at the pictures: "We and our Chinese brothers defeated the Japanese devils together in the past. Today, our strength is even greater, and kind people all over the world support us. We will definitely achieve final victory." All the students in the propaganda instructor training class in Lilli San-ri, Dong District, Pyongyang City, wrote a letter to the people of our country to pay their respects after seeing the exhibition. The letter said: "Seeing the photos of the Volunteer Army comrades and the People's Army fighting bravely side by side, and the Chinese brothers working hard for the resistance against US aggression and aid Korea, our determination to overcome difficulties and support the front lines and our confidence in winning the final victory have been further strengthened. We are determined to do a good job in internationalist propaganda work, to consolidate the friendship and solidarity between the Korean people and the Chinese people, as well as the people of other brotherly countries."

    【新华社平壤三十日电】平壤市人民委员会于十一月、十二月先后在市区街头九十八处举办“中国人民抗美援朝图片展览会”。图片主要分两部分：一部分是中国人民轰轰烈烈地展开抗美援朝运动的情形，其中包括中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜作战和中国人民以增产捐献等行动热烈支援前线的情形；另一部分是朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军和无数朝鲜爱国志士过去在中国境内，和中国人民一起与日寇进行英勇斗争的情形。平壤市各里的民主宣传室为了深入宣传朝中人民的友谊，分别召集居民开会，详细讲解图片的内容。
