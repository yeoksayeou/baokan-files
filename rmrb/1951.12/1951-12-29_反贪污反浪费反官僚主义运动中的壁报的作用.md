The wall newspaper of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, I rarely looked at it; today I was attracted by the "Increase Production and Practice Economy Special Issue" and read it through.

Oh my! So many things:

　　The National Day Reception Office spent 1.25 million yuan to buy five reams of oil paper for wiping bowls and chopsticks, cut into 180,000 pieces, but only used one-third, leaving 120,000 pieces;

　　Also, renting three old cars from private merchants and painting them for appearance cost 2.8 million yuan, but we only used them for eighteen days;

　　Also, buying large quantities of fruit, unable to finish eating, 300 jin rotted;

　　Also, the Second Reception Office built a bathhouse, costing 1.4 million yuan, which was never used;

　　The fruit bought for the urban relief and welfare work conference was forgotten in the warehouse, and more than a box rotted.

　　Six electric light lines connected to the neighboring auto repair shop, for two years, no one noticed;

　　Some comrades used newspaper clips as fire pokers;

　　Building a flower room, the wood was our own, but the labor cost alone was 11 million yuan;

　　Small and medium-sized canteens separated by a thin wall cost 8 million yuan;

　　For a dormitory to repair a sewer, instead of using iron pipes, chimney pipes were used, which broke three times, penny-wise, pound-foolish;…………

　　Many of these things, I had never heard of, nor had I imagined. The bureaucracy of the leadership should first examine itself. Saying a few words about economy and cherishing public property at a staff meeting will not be effective if not followed by actual inspection. There are many ways to inspect, the most thorough and effective is to mobilize the masses to inspect. The masses write their opinions into articles and post them on the wall newspapers for everyone to see, which is more practical and powerful than general speeches at meetings. The wall newspaper is the concentration of public opinion in the organ, a place for improving work - criticism and self-criticism, we must pay attention to it; to form a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the organ, it is indispensable.

　　The editorial board of the wall newspaper should be strengthened to become an important driving force for the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Make all the facts of corruption and waste, and all kinds of bureaucracy at all levels, appear on the wall newspaper.

　　The wall newspaper should learn from the People's Daily, and everything revealed on the wall newspaper must be answered on the wall newspaper. If it is incorrect, there is freedom to clarify; if it is correct, a self-criticism should be made. Leaders must often look at the wall newspapers to understand the situation and promptly decide on methods for improvement.

　　The editorial board of the wall newspaper of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government is urging relevant parties to respond, and the General Office is also cooperating with the General Affairs Section to inspect the reports in the wall newspaper, and has decided to reorganize the Life Committee, giving the Life Committee certain powers, and all expenditures of more than a certain number of yuan must be inspected and discussed by the Life Committee before they can be used, and more important ones must be reported to the head of the department for approval, to stop the disorganized and irresponsible phenomenon of spending money.

　　This method is good, I hope everyone will stick to it.

    反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中的壁报的作用
     谢觉哉
    中央人民政府内务部的壁报，我很少去看它；今天为“增产节约专号”所吸引，把它看了一遍。
    哎呀！有这么多的事：
    国庆招待处为擦碗筷花一百二十五万元买五令油光纸，裁成十八万块，只用了三分之一，剩下十二万块；
    又，租用私商三部旧汽车，为好看，刷上漆，化二百八十万，但我们只用了十八天；
    又，大批买水果，吃不清，烂掉三百斤；
    又，招待处二所修澡塘，花一百四十万，根本没有用；
    城市救济福利工作会议买的水果，放在库房忘掉了，烂了一箱多。
    六条电灯线通到隔壁汽车修理厂，两年了，没有人察觉；
    有的同志以报夹子当火通条用；
    盖花房，木料是自己的，只工钱即花一千一百万；
    小、中灶食堂隔一个薄薄的墙，花了八百万；
    给一个宿舍修下水道，不用铁管而用烟筒代替，坏了三次，因小失大；…………
    这些事，好多是我没有听到过，且没有想像过。领导方面的官僚主义，应该首先检讨。在工作人员大会上讲几句要节约，要爱护公家财产的话，如果不接着有实际的检查，是不会发生效力的。检查的方法颇多，最能深入与有效的是发动群众检查。群众把意见写成文章贴在壁报上，让大家看，又比一般的会上的发言要来得实在些，有力些。壁报是机关里的民意集中所在，是改进工作——批评与自我批评的园地，我们要重视它；要把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义在机关里形成运动，更非有它不可。
    壁报的编辑委员会要加强，使成为反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重要的推动机。使贪污浪费的大小事实，各层次的各式各样的官僚主义都在壁报上现形。
    壁报，应学习人民日报的样，凡在壁报上揭露的，必须在壁报上答复。不对呢，有辨明的自由；对呢，应作检讨。领导人员必须时常看壁报，以了解情况，及时决定改进的方法。
    中央人民政府内务部壁报编辑委员会正在催促有关方面作答复，办公厅也正在协同总务科检查壁报上所载的各项报道，并决定改组生活委员会，给生活委员以一定权利，凡开支在若干万元以上的，必须经过生活委员会检查、讨论，才能使用，较重要的须报告部首长批准，停止那种无组织，不负责任的用钱的现象。
    这办法是好的，希望大家坚持下去。
