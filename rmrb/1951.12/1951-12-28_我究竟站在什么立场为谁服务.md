What Stand Do I Really Take and Whom Do I Serve?
Luo Changpei, Director of the Institute of Arts, Peking University, and Professor of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature

Since liberation, I have also made some remarks or written some articles on the ideological remolding of myself and intellectuals in general. At first, I thought I held a "supra-class" ideology and did not understand the issue from a developmental perspective. I only knew how to stick to the so-called "academic freedom" and "freedom of thought" of the "Peking University tradition," and I was simply ignorant of the basic spirit of the Chinese Communist Party and the New Democratic Revolution. Later, through mass education and diligent study of preliminary political theories, I thought I understood the laws of social development, established a mass perspective, and understood issues such as democratic centralism and the united front. Since learning that mental laborers are part of the working class, I even shamelessly said, "I have restored class consciousness and confirmed my class stand." In fact, the ideological remolding of old intellectuals is neither that easy nor that quickly accomplished. This time, teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities and colleges launched a political study campaign, listened to sincere and profound reports from Premier Zhou and Comrade Peng Zhen, and read Chairman Mao's opening speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which made me realize that in the past two years, I had only been talking about it and writing about it, and had not truly transformed myself by realistically linking my actions and specific work. Upon careful examination, there are still many serious problems in my past and present ideology.

A year before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese knew I was Manchurian and wanted to use narrow nationalism to surround me and make me a traitor. My class was full of graduates from schools like the Japanese Colonization University, who tried every means to lure me, but I did not betray the Chinese nation. Shortly after the fall of Beijing, I followed Peking University to Hengshan, Changsha, Kunming, and Mengzi. At that time, I thought I had patriotic ideas and a national stance. However, a truly patriotic person with a national stance should not only oppose Japanese imperialism but also all imperialism; not only oppose traitors who surrender to Japan but also all national thieves who collude with imperialism to sell out the country. I certainly abandoned my wife and children and broke away from the rule of the Japanese puppets, but I also confusedly threw myself into the circle of the reactionary Kuomintang government. After suffering for seven years, I was happily invited by an American university and thought I had received "international honor," but in reality, I ran to the base camp of imperialism, benefited from the surplus exploitation of American workers by the Rockefellers, and even fantasized about seeking "democracy" there. This shows that I have a confused idea of ​​distinguishing between friend and foe.

Only those who can strictly distinguish between friend and foe can have a clear people's stand. In the past, I always thought that I had been teaching or doing research work in schools and had not been involved in the political vortex. In fact, all education and academics are inseparable from politics. Working in schools or research institutions under the reactionary government, except for a few who participated in the revolution, directly or indirectly played a counter-revolutionary role. Taking myself as an example, in Beijing and Kunming, I always touted myself as having an attitude of "academics for academics' sake." On the one hand, I encouraged students to compete in examinations for government-funded overseas study, and on the other hand, I advised Communist Party members with ten years of party membership to read more books and meddle less in "idle affairs"! Moreover, in 1942, I took Gu Yuxiu's car to Dali for a survey of minority languages. Later, the puppet Ministry of Education appointed me as a member of the "Oriental Language Specialized School." Although I did not participate in any preparatory work, Zhu Jiahua's party members in Kunming were afraid that I would be taken away by the C.C. Clique and used the title of Deputy Director of the Frontier Education Committee of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters to lure me and persuade me to join the Kuomintang. I scolded him away at the time. Subsequently, Zhu Jiahua wrote repeatedly to persuade me to join the Kuomintang, using the weakness of the petty bourgeoisie who liked to be flattered. After his repeated compliments, I acted insincerely. Later, although I did not fill out a form, take an oath, pay party dues, participate in any activities, or ever register, and did not agree to Zhu Jiahua's bait of using minority language surveys to lure me to Xinjiang, I did not publicly and sternly refuse to join the party. Undeniably, after the Southern Anhui Incident, when the struggle was very acute, in 1942 and 1943, I gave two lectures on literature and history to the Kuomintang branch of the Southwest Associated University. Although I put forward conditions to them: 1. Do not propagandize for the Kuomintang; 2. Do not interfere with the content of the lecture; 3. Do not restrict the choice of lecturers, I also called on some young people to listen to the lectures, playing a supporting role.

In the spring of 1943, ten professors from various universities in Kunming were invited by Mr. Li Genyuan to give lectures at the "Yunnan-West Wartime Work Cadre Training Corps" in Dali, and I was among them. Most of these ten people have now joined the ranks of the people, but one of them, Cai Weifan, a Central Statistics Bureau secret agent, is now missing. Looking at the essence of the so-called "Yunnan-West Wartime Work Cadre Training Corps," the head of the corps was concurrently held by the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, and Song Xilian concurrently served as the Director of Education. It was completely a military secret service organization under the rule of the reactionaries. Although my purpose was to take the opportunity to investigate minority languages, and the scope of the lectures did not go beyond my profession, I once again strengthened the momentum of the reactionaries in effect. Therefore, before liberation, I did play a supporting role for the reactionary ruling class several times. Since I could not be considered "supra-class," I should not have claimed to be "noble"!

Not long after liberation, I thought I understood the meaning of the people's democratic dictatorship, but without practical experience in struggle, I would show my true colors when I encountered specific problems. Now let me give two examples: First, before the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was officially launched, two comrades came to ask for my opinion. At that time, on the one hand, I did not understand the situation of the enemy and us, and did not have firm revolutionary optimism; on the other hand, I quoted Chairman Mao's past words, "We will not attack unless we are attacked," completely failing to stand on the internationalist stand, promote new patriotism, and somewhat containing "fear of America" emotions and a desire for "peace." Second, I used to know that reactionary foreign missionaries were the vanguards of imperialism, but when I reviewed the preface to Ma Xueliang's "Study of Sani Yi Language," I turned a blind eye to the serious errors in it and allowed it to be printed, so that both of us made a big mistake! Not only that, just when that book was about to be published, I also used the Jesuit priest He Dahua's document defending Tang Ruowang to write a "Supplement to the Jesuits' Contribution to Phonology." The word "contribution" in the title was inappropriate, and the article called the document "Document clearing Tang Ruowang of guilt," and the process of Yang Guangxian's struggle against Tang Ruowang was entitled "Outline of Yang Guangxian's Frame-up of Tang Ruowang Case"... In particular, I made the mistake of treating the enemy as a friend. Although that article was not publicly published, it can clearly show a glimpse of my own ideological confusion. If I had a clear people's stand and clearly distinguished between friend and foe, such results as mentioned above would not have occurred no matter how I handled things or used materials.

As for the working class's stand, which is the goal of our study this time, it can only be achieved through strict ideological struggle and long-term practice and training, and cannot be accomplished overnight. Before liberation, I did not have this kind of ideological consciousness at all. After liberation, I thought that since I had been using the income from my mental labor as my main source of livelihood since I was eighteen years old, I therefore seemed to be a member of the working class. In fact, classifying class components does not equal changing class consciousness. Because the working class should be selfless, help each other, and love each other, not deceive or suspect each other. In the past two years, I was very dissatisfied with Mr. Tang Yongtong's attitude of self-preservation and his perfunctory and delaying style that did not demonstrate planning or initiative during his tenure as chairman of the Peking University Preparatory Committee. However, instead of taking a mutual assistance attitude, speaking my mind frankly, and giving advice face to face, I criticized him behind his back. This is completely an old habit of liberalism and has absolutely no cultivation of the working class. I think that if the old intellectuals who are being reformed take the mirror of Marxism-Leninism and look at themselves, many people will surely find faces similar to mine, or even uglier. In addition, Mr. Qian Duansheng and I jointly organized a Peking University Faculty and Staff Union and a Peking University Trade Union. Not only did we not develop class friendship, but we also reduced our old friendship. The reason is that he was subjective, and I was arrogant, and we could not persuade or help each other, so that for two years, except for meeting in public places, we have not visited each other or made a single phone call. How can such an uncooperative chairman and secretary-general run the trade union well? As for my work in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature at Peking University, I was dissatisfied with Professor Tang Lan's past work style in handling departmental affairs, but instead of criticizing and helping him with a kind attitude, I used frivolous language to attack him, especially in unprincipled disputes, committing the error of being narrow-minded and intolerant.

The working class should subordinate personal interests to collective interests. However, when I was recommended by the Peking University Faculty and Staff Union to be the Minister of Welfare, I repeatedly refused. Later, although I was persuaded by the masses to reluctantly take the position, I did not do anything about the interests of this class. One of the main tasks of the trade union is to safeguard the interests of the working class in all aspects and by all means. The Welfare Department is precisely the institution that can exert this great role. The reason why I insisted on refusing was simply because I was afraid that taking on this work related to collective interests would hinder my personal business and affect my personal health. This is purely a concrete manifestation of starting from the individual and lacking organizational concepts.

The working class should have lofty revolutionary ideals, great minds, and boldness. They see clearly the future of social development, pursue the bright future of mankind, and are not afraid of any difficult struggles in order to build a new democratic society and prepare for the transition to socialist and communist society; at the same time, their ideals are lofty, but their work is very practical; when they encounter difficulties, they find ways to overcome them; when they have problems, they calmly analyze and solve them. There is absolutely no problem with fanaticism, impatience, discouragement, or disappointment. As for personal status, reputation, immediate gains and losses, and trivial matters, how can a well-cultivated working class have time to care about them? However, my main problem is self-importance and individual heroism. This was the case before liberation, and it has not been eliminated after liberation. I like others to flatter me, so I went astray before liberation; I am unwilling to humbly accept criticism, so I cannot get the real opinions of the masses. I like to compare myself with others, due to the influence of personal desires for position; I like to show off my ability, due to the unrooted evil of fame. I am complacent when I have made some achievements; I am arrogant when I am slightly dissatisfied. I have the style of a feudal patriarch and an old-fashioned teacher towards young cadres, and can only force orders, with little persuasion and education. I often "use criticism as honesty" to my colleagues, hurting people with harsh words, and cannot help them overcome their weaknesses and correct their mistakes in principle. As for teaching and doing things, on the surface, it seems that I am quite serious and responsible; upon careful examination, I have not been able to forget myself everywhere. Because I teach phonology and linguistics, I always want to teach better than others. Because I lead the Institute of Arts of Peking University and the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences, I always want to have more achievements than others. Recently, I heard someone criticize me, saying: "If Peking University has conflicts with other institutions, he will definitely stand on the side of Peking University; when the Institute of Arts has conflicts with other units of Peking University, he will definitely stand on the side of the Institute of Arts; once the Institute of Linguistics has conflicts with the Institute of Arts, he will stand on the side of the Institute of Linguistics." I have not yet overcome this selfish desire of departmentalism. The dispute I had with Director Ji Xianlin of the Department of Oriental Languages ​​of Peking University in 1950 during the National Day for recording the languages ​​of various ethnic minorities is a concrete example. If everyone's goal of work is to serve the people, how can there be misunderstandings between each other? In addition, impatience and narrow-mindedness are my second serious problems, and this problem is manifested in all aspects of speaking, writing, doing things, and dealing with people; even the symptoms of high blood pressure are both the cause and effect of impatience. People with the cultivation of the working class have a long-term vision and a broad mind. They can use historical materialism and dialectical materialism to observe, analyze, and solve problems. How can they be impatient and narrow-minded?

The working class should continuously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to improve their theories and abilities at any time for the revolutionary cause. As for me, I only took a political course at Peking University for one year. Under the teaching method of "teachers and students helping each other and learning from each other," I read some preliminary political theory books and made several enlightening reports that recited dogmas and could not be related to reality. Since then, because business has taken up most of my time, I have not been able to continue to study political theory. Until now, not only have I not dared to touch classic works such as Das Kapital, Anti-Dühring, and Dialectics of Nature, but I have not even been able to carefully and thoroughly read the basic Marxist-Leninist works, such as the Short Course of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), in conjunction with various documents! If you want to transform yourself but cannot systematically study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and always relate them to your own thoughts and work, how can you predict the education of the next generation or lead research work?

Because the position is unstable, one will naturally not serve the people wholeheartedly. According to the analysis of Vice Minister Qian Junrui of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, I should belong to the category of "being a teacher for personal life." In the past, I occasionally had some sense of justice and was dissatisfied with the reactionary rule and my own situation, but I did not have the determination to resist, and objectively promoted the Kuomintang's reactionary education to some extent. Sometimes, in order to maintain my own survival status, I would unconsciously maintain the old system. This is just as Stalin said in his conversation with Wells: "The old system has many highly educated people standing on its side and serving it. These highly educated people support the old system and oppose the new system." This type of intellectual may sometimes show considerable resistance to the extent that the reactionary ruling class is not fundamentally overthrown. Once the reactionary regime is about to be overthrown and affects the individual's survival status, they will hesitate and no longer show resistance. Mr. Tang Yongtong also specifically pointed out this point in his self-examination, which shows that this is a common problem among our old intellectuals. The period when I was in Kunming, on the one hand, I was close to and distanced myself from the Kuomintang reactionaries, and on the other hand, I led the May Fourth Literary and Art Evening with Mr. Wen Yiduo and others, which promoted a progressive atmosphere. This can just show my extremely contradictory ideological consciousness. Engels said: "At any time, no one can cover up contradictions for a long time. Contradictions must be resolved by struggle." Since the launch of this study campaign, I have constantly reflected on myself, accused myself, and carried out ideological struggle. Now that I have frankly exposed it, I hope to get help from the masses so that I can move forward a step.

Ideological consciousness is inseparable from class character. Among the many ideological consciousnesses I have revealed, such as individualism, liberalism, wavering, impatience, and fear of serious struggle—all belong to the petty bourgeoisie's class character; as for selfishness, arrogance, and individual heroism, that is the class character of the exploiting class. In the past, I always thought that since I was eighteen years old, I had been maintaining the life of myself and my family by working as a shorthand technician, and later I had been teaching in middle schools or universities. Now I am still a city dweller without a house or a field, and all three generations have been "eating grain money" soldiers and have not been high officials. According to the division of class components, I consider myself to be a mental laborer, even if I have been a professor for many years and lived a relatively prosperous life, I am at most a petty bourgeoisie, where did the consciousness of the exploiting class come from? If you analyze it calmly, it is not the case. In the past, Manchurians called grain money "iron crops," because farmers were still afraid of drought, flood, and locusts, while the bannermen could receive salaries and rice every month and every quarter, regardless of the harvest. This proverb can fully express that my ancestors once lived without working. The remaining ideological consciousness of the exploiting class that I have is derived from this source. For forty years, I was oppressed by feudal warlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries' Han chauvinism, and I always had a sense of inferiority in my youth. At that time, I once wrote to people saying: "I have the intention of a lone minister and an illegitimate son, and I always have the ambition to strive to go upstream." This is enough to show my mood of trying my best to climb up because of being oppressed. Later, I relied on some knowledge that had nothing to do with improving people's lives and climbed to a considerable position, and that sense of inferiority changed into a sense of self-esteem. In this way, it further promoted self-importance and individual heroism! This kind of ideological consciousness is definitely not what the working class should have.

If we cannot firmly establish a revolutionary position and thoroughly clarify the above-mentioned non-working-class ideological consciousness with positive revolutionary actions, not only will we not be able to serve the people well and be a good people's teacher or scientific worker, but even this study campaign may not be able to go deep. If we want to be determined to transform ourselves, we must first bravely admit our mistakes, ruthlessly expose our shortcomings, deny the past without any nostalgia, and discard our burdens; then systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, deeply experience the lives of working people among the masses, rely on the organization, approach the revolutionary people, and firmly establish a revolutionary outlook on life and worldview, so that we can guide the next generation to a more developed future in teaching and cooperate with the construction of new democracy in scientific research at any time, and have a foresight to welcome socialism and communism. We should not fantasize about being Nietzsche's hypothetical "superman," nor should we fantasize about being Ibsen's "enemy of the people"; we should only learn from the masses and be an "anonymous cell" that obeys the organization and abides by discipline in the great cause of revolution. Only in this way can our mental laborers truly be transformed into the working class. However, this study is only a turning point for us to get rid of the old and bring forth the new. To completely transform, we still have to rely on many practical works in the future to test for a long time. If someone cannot stand the test in practice, it shows that he has not studied seriously and has not completed the task of ideological remolding!

    我究竟站在什么立场为谁服务
    北京大学文科研究所所长兼中国语文学系教授  罗常培
    解放以来，我对于自己和一般知识分子的思想改造问题也曾发表过一些言论或文字。起初，我曾经自己以为抱着“超阶级”的思想，并且丝毫不懂从发展看问题。只知道故步自封地保守着所谓“学术自由”和“思想自由”的“北大传统”，对于中国共产党和新民主主义革命的基本精神，简直是茫昧的。后来经过群众的教育和黾勉，学习初步的政治理论，又自以为了解了社会发展的规律，建立了群众观点，懂得了民主集中制和统一战线等问题。自从知道了脑力劳动者是工人阶级的一部分以后，更大言不惭地说：“恢复了阶级意识，确认了阶级立场。”其实，旧知识分子的思想改造问题，既不是这么容易，也不能这样速成。这次京津高等学校教师展开政治学习，先后听到了周总理和彭真同志诚恳、深刻的报告，又读了毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的开会词，越发使我觉得过去两年只是口头说说，笔下写写，并没能实事求是地联系自己的行动和具体的工作来切实改造自己。认真检讨起来，我过去和现在的思想意识中还存在着许多很严重的问题。
    抗日战争前一年，日本人知道我是满洲人，想利用狭隘的民族主义包围我作汉奸。在我的班上充满着日本拓殖大学一类学校的毕业生，千方百计地引诱我，可是我并没有背叛了中华民族。北京沦陷后不久，我就随着北京大学迁到衡山、长沙、昆明、蒙自，在当时我很以为有了爱国思想和民族立场。但是真正有民族立场的爱国主义者不但要反对日本帝国主义，而且要反对一切帝国主义；不但要反对投降日本的汉奸，而且要反对一切勾结帝国主义出卖祖国的民贼；我固然抛妻弃子地脱离了日伪的统治，可是又糊里糊涂地投入了国民党反动政府的圈子；苦熬了七年之后，一经美国大学邀请，又高高兴兴地自以为得到“国际荣誉”，实际却跑到了帝国主义的大本营，沾润了洛克菲勒剥削美国劳动人民的余沈，并且妄想在那里寻求“民主”。这就说明了我存在着敌我不分的糊涂思想。
    能够严格分清敌我的人才会有明确的人民立场。我过去总以为一向在学校教书，或者作研究工作，并没有陷入政治的漩涡。其实一切教育和学术是离不开政治的，在反动政府主持下的学校或研究机关工作，除了少数参加革命的以外，直接间接都起了一些反人民的作用。拿我自己来说，在北京，在昆明，一向对自己标榜着“为学术而学术”的态度；对学生一方面鼓励他们竞争官费留学生的考试，一方面劝告有十年党龄的共产党员多念书少管“闲事”！况且，一九四二年我为调查少数民族语言曾经搭顾毓琇的便车到过一次大理，后来伪教育部又发表我作“东方语文专门学校”的委员，我虽然没参加过任何筹备工作，可是昆明的朱家骅党徒恐怕我被C·C·拉去，曾经拿国民党中央党部边疆教育委员会副主任委员的头衔来引诱我，劝我入国民党，当时被我骂退了。随后，朱家骅又接二连三地写信劝我入国民党，利用小资产阶级喜欢受人奉承的弱点，经他百般恭维，我就虚与委蛇。以后，我虽然没填表，没宣誓，没交党费，没参加过任何活动，也从来没登记，又没答应朱家骅拿调查少数民族语言作饵，引诱我到新疆，但是，对于入党的事并没公然地严词拒绝。无可讳言地，我在皖南事变后，当斗争很尖锐的时候，在一九四二、一九四三两年我还给西南联大国民党支部办过两次文史讲演会。我对他们虽然提出了条件：一、不给国民党作宣传；二、不得干涉讲演内容；三、不得限制讲员人选。但也替他们号召一部分青年来听讲，起了帮闲的作用。
    一九四三年春天，昆明各大学的十位教授应李根源先生的邀请到大理“滇西战时工作干部训练团”去讲演，我也在内。这十个人现在大部分参加了人民的行列，可是其中也有一个现在不知去向的中统特务蔡维藩。再从所谓“滇西战时工作干部训练团”的本质来看，团长由蒋匪介石自兼，宋希濂兼教育长，完全是一个反动派统治下的军事特务机构。我的目的虽然想借机会调查少数民族语言，讲演的范围也没出了本行以外，可是在作用上又一次给反动派壮大了声势。所以在解放前，我确乎给反动统治阶级起了几次帮闲的作用，既然不能算是“超阶级”，更不该自命“清高”！
    解放以后不久，我颇以为懂了人民民主专政的意义，不过没有实际斗争的经验，一遇到具体的问题就会露出马脚。现在让我举两个例子：第一、在抗美援朝运动还没有正式揭开的时候，曾有两位同志来问我的意见。我当时一方面不了解敌我的情况，没有坚决的革命乐观主义；一方面搬出毛主席过去所说的“人不犯我，我不犯人”的几句话，完全没能站在国际主义的立场，发挥新爱国主义，并且多少含有“恐美”的情绪，和希望“太平”的思想。第二、从前我也晓得反动的外国传教士是帝国主义的先遣队，可是，当我审查马学良所作“撒尼彝语研究”序文时，对于其中的严重错误竟自熟视无睹，让它照样付印，以致两人同样犯了很大的错误！不但如此，正在那部书快要出版的时候，我还利用耶稣会教士何大化替汤若望辩解的文件作了一篇“耶稣会士在音韵学上的贡献补”，题目中的“贡献”两字既不妥当，文章里又把那份文件叫做“昭雪汤若望文件”，对于杨光先斗争汤若望的经过又题作“杨光先诬陷汤若望案的概略”……尤其犯了认敌作友的错误。那篇文章虽然没有公开发表，可是由此很可以看出我自己思想混乱的一斑。假若我有明确的人民立场，划清敌我界限，无论处理事情，运用材料，都不会发生上面所说的那样结果。
    至于工人阶级的立场是我们这次学习的目标，更要经过严格的思想斗争，长期的实践、锻炼才可以达到，并不能一蹴而及的。解放以前我根本就没有这种思想意识，解放以后又自以为从十八岁起就以脑力劳动所得作主要生活的来源，因而俨然以工人阶级自居。其实，划分了阶级成份不等于改变了阶级意识。因为工人阶级应该大公无私，互助互爱，不应该尔诈我虞，互相猜嫉。过去两年来，我对于汤用彤先生主持北京大学前校务委员会时期所表现的明哲保身的态度，不能发挥计划性、积极性的敷衍、拖延的作风，心里很不满意，可是并没抱着互助的态度，知无不言，言无不尽地当面劝告，却在背后乱批评他。这完全是自由主义的旧习气，绝对没有工人阶级的修养。我想正在改造中的旧知识分子如果拿马克思、列宁主义的镜子自己照一照，一定有好些位可以发现和我有类似的面孔，或许更丑恶一点儿。此外，我和钱端升先生共同办过一次北京大学教职员联合会，一次北京大学工会，我们俩不单没发生过阶级友爱，反而减低了旧日的交情。原因是他既主观，我也自大，而又不能彼此说服、帮忙，以致两年来除在公共场所见面外，没有互相访问过，也没通过一次电话。这样不合作的主席和秘书长，如何能搞好工会呢？至于我在北京大学中国语文系，对于唐兰教授过去处理系务的作风不满意，但是不能抱着与人为善的态度来批评他，帮助他，反而用轻薄的口吻去打击他，尤其是无原则的纠纷，犯了狭隘不能容人的错误。
    工人阶级是应该以个人利益服从集体利益的。但是我经北京大学教职员联合会推举作福利部长的时候，却一再坚辞，后来虽经群众说服，勉强担任，终于没做出什么有关本阶级利益的事情来。工会的主要任务之一，就是从各方面，尽一切方法，维护工人阶级的利益，福利部正是可以发挥这种巨大作用的机构，而我所以要坚辞，无非怕因为担任这件有关集体利益的工作，妨碍了个人的业务，影响了个人的身体。这纯粹是从个人出发，没有组织观念的具体表现。
    工人阶级应该具有崇高的革命理想，伟大的胸怀和气魄。他们看清楚了社会发展的前途，追求着人类光明的远景，为着建设新民主主义社会，并且准备着过渡到社会主义社会和共产主义社会，不怕任何艰难困苦的斗争；同时，他们的理想虽然远大，工作却非常切实；遇到困难设法克服，有了问题冷静地分析、解决，绝没有狂热、急躁、灰心、失望的毛病。至于个人的地位、名誉，眼前的鸡虫得失，微末的身边琐事，在有修养的工人阶级哪里还有功夫计较呢？但是，我自己主要的病根就是自高自大的个人英雄主义。解放以前如此，解放以后还没消除。我喜欢别人奉承，因此解放前曾经误入歧途；不肯虚心接受批评，因此得不到群众的真正意见。好跟别人计较高低，由于地位的私欲作祟；好逞能、好表现，由于好名的孽根未拔。稍有所得，就沾沾自喜；小不如意，便盛气凌人。对于青年干部有封建家长和旧式塾师的作风，只能强迫命令，很少说服教育。对于一般同事往往“以讦为直”，恶语伤人，而不能从原则上帮助他们去克服弱点，改正错误。至于教书和办事，从表面上看，好像是颇能认真负责；仔细检讨起来，却处处没能忘我。因为是我教音韵学、语言学，所以总想比别人教得好，因为是我领导北京大学文科研究所和科学院语言研究所，所以总想比别人有成绩。最近听见有人批评我说：“如果北大跟别的机构有矛盾时，他一定站在北大一边；文科研究所跟北大其他单位有矛盾时，他一定站在文科研究所一边；一旦语言研究所跟文科研究所发生矛盾时，他就会站在语言研究所一边了。”这种本位主义的私心，我的确还没克服掉。一九五○年国庆节为了各少数民族语言录音事，我跟北京大学东方语文学系季羡林主任发生争执，就是一个具体的例子。假如大家工作的目标都是为人民服务，又何至于彼此误会呢？还有急躁、褊狭是我第二个严重病根，无论在说话、作文、处事、接物的哪一方面都表现着这种毛病；就是高血压的病征也是跟褊急的性情互为因果的。有了工人阶级修养的人，眼光远，胸襟宽，遇事对人可以应用历史唯物论和辩证唯物论去观察、分析、解决，哪里会急躁褊狭呢？
    工人阶级应该继续不断地研究马列主义和毛泽东思想，为了革命事业随时增进自己的理论和能力。我呢，只有在北京大学担任政治课的一年，在“师生互助，教学相长”的教学方法下，读了一些初步的政治理论书，作了几次背诵教条、不能联系实际的启发报告；以后总因为业务占了大部分时间，没能继续不断地研究政治理论。直到现在，不单像资本论、反杜林论、自然辩证法一类的经典著作还没敢摸，连马列主义的基本著作联共（布）党史简明教程，也没能结合各种文件去仔细精读！要想改造自己，而不能有计划地研读马列主义的基本理论，随时联系到自己的思想和工作，那怎么能够有预见地教育后一代或领导研究工作呢？
    因为立场站不稳，自然就不会全心全意地为人民服务。照中央人民政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长所分析，我应该属于“为着个人的生活，而为人师”的一类。过去也偶尔发生一些正义感，不满意于反动统治和自己的境遇，但是没有反抗的决心，并且多少在客观上推行了国民党的反动教育。有时为了自己的生存地位还会不知不觉地维护旧制度。这正如斯大林与威尔斯的谈话中所说：“旧制度有很多受过高等教育的人站在自己方面，给自己服务，这些受过高等教育的人拥护旧制度，反对新制度。”这一类的知识分子在不至于根本推翻反动统治阶级的限度内，有时也许表示相当的反抗，一到反动政权快要推翻，影响了个人的生存地位的时候，反到有所顾惜，不再表示反抗。汤用彤先生作自我检讨时也特别指出了这一点，足见这是我们旧知识分子的通病。我在昆明的一段，一方面跟国民党反动派若即若离，一方面也跟闻一多先生等领导五四文艺晚会，推动了进步的空气，这正可以表现我极端矛盾的思想意识。恩格斯说：“在任何时候，没有谁可以把矛盾长期掩蔽起来。矛盾须由斗争来解决。”这次展开学习以来，我不断地反省、自讼、实行思想斗争，现在坦白地暴露出来，更希望得到群众的帮助，使我可以向前推进一步。
    思想意识是跟阶级性分不开的。在我所揭发的许多思想意识中，像个人主义、自由主义、动摇、急躁、惧怕严重的斗争——都属于小资产阶级的阶级性；至于自私自利、自高自大和个人英雄主义那就是剥削阶级的阶级性了。从前我总以为从十八岁起就靠作速记技士维持个人和家庭的生活，后来也一直在中学或大学教书，到现在还是一个房无一间，地无一垅的市民，而且三代以内都是“吃钱粮”的军人，并没作过大官；照阶级成份来划分，自认可以算是一个脑力劳动的工人，即使作过多年的教授，生活比较优裕，顶多也不过是个小资产阶级，哪里来的剥削阶级的意识呢？要是冷静地分析一下，就不然了。从前满洲人管钱粮叫做“铁杆儿庄稼”，因为农民的收获还怕旱涝蝗虫，而旗人不论年成好坏，都可以按月有饷，按季有米。这句谚语充分可以表现我的上辈曾经是不劳而获的。我所残余的剥削阶级的思想意识就是从这个根源孳衍出来的。四十年来受了封建军阀和国民党反动派大汉族主义的压迫，在我的青年时代老存着自卑心理。那时曾经给人写信说：“余以孤臣孽子之意结，时存力争上游之壮志”。这足以表现我因为受压迫而极力想往上爬的情绪。及至后来靠着一些跟改善人民生活无关的知识，爬到了相当的地位，那种自卑心理又一变而为自尊心理，这样一来，更助长了自高自大的个人英雄主义！这种思想意识绝对不是工人阶级所应有的。
    我们如果不能坚定革命的立场，以正面的革命行动来彻底澄清以上这些非工人阶级的思想意识，不单不能很好地为人民服务，作个很好的人民教师或科学工作者，就连这次学习也恐怕不能深入。要想决心改造，我们就先得勇敢地承认自己的错误，无情地揭露自己的缺点，毫无留恋地否定过去，丢掉包袱；然后有系统地研读马列主义和毛泽东思想，深入群众中体验劳动人民的生活，依靠组织，接近革命人民，坚定地建立革命的人生观和世界观，使我们在教学上引导下一代走上更发展的前途，在科学研究上随时配合着新民主主义的建设，并且要有迎接社会主义和共产主义的预见。我们不要妄想作尼采所假设的“超人”，也不要妄想作易卜生所描写的“人民公敌”；我们只应该向群众学习，在革命的伟大事业中作一个服从组织、遵守纪律的“无名的细胞”。必须如此，我们脑力劳动者才可以名副其实地转换成工人阶级。不过这次学习只是我们除旧更新的转捩点，要想彻底改造还得靠着以后许多实际工作来长期考验。假若有人在实践上经不起考验，那就表明他并没认真学习，并没完成思想改造的任务！
