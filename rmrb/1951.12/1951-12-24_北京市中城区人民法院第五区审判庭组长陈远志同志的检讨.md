    Comrade Chen Yuanzhi, Head of the Fifth Tribunal of the People's Court of Zhongcheng District, Beijing, Self-Criticism

    Regarding the suicide of Zhai Zhongting by poisoning, the Fifth Tribunal convened self-criticism meetings on November 14th and 15th consecutively. In the past, I felt under a lot of work pressure and always wanted to push work outwards. I have said more than once to the comrades in charge of receiving and dispatching documents and to the police comrades: "Do not answer questions casually. If the comrades in the trial work have no time, for citizens who have not submitted a formal complaint, they can be referred to the Municipal Court to answer questions or to write a complaint on their behalf." Although this tribunal does not have a regulation of "no case will be accepted without a formal complaint," in fact, except for urgent cases where both parties are present, or cases where organs send criminals under arrest for immediate processing, generally, the complainants are asked to go back and write a complaint and then notified at a fixed time. The occurrence of the suicide of Zhai Zhongting by poisoning shows that we have bureaucratic work styles of not caring about the lives of the masses and lacking enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility for the interests of the people. I should bear the main responsibility for this incident. Through the examination of this incident, we have clearly stipulated: from now on, whenever citizens verbally file a lawsuit, after asking clearly about the relevant names, addresses, and what the matter is, we will number and register it, and then assign the case for processing.

    北京市中城区人民法院第五区审判庭组长陈远志同志的检讨
    对翟中亭服毒事件，第五区审判庭连续在十一月十四日、十五日召开了检讨会。过去，我感到工作压力大，对工作总想往外推。我不止一次地对负责收发的同志和警士同志们讲：“不要随意解答问题。如审判工作同志无时间，对没有呈文的市民，可介绍到市法院代为解答或代写呈文。”本庭虽然没有规定“无呈文不受理”，但是，事实上，除双方都到的紧急案件，或机关送有押犯的案件马上进行处理外，一般的是让申诉人回去写呈文后再定期通知。翟中亭服毒事件的发生，说明了我们有不关心群众生活、对人民利益缺乏热情和责任心的官僚主义作风。对这一次事件，我应该负主要责任。通过这一事件的检查，我们明确规定：今后凡市民口头起诉的，问清楚有关姓名、住址、什么事，编号、登记后，就分案进行处理。    陈远志
