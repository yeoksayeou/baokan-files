To the Editor:

    Cadres Participating in Land Reform in Xiangxiang County Should Not Eat Meals or Accept Gifts from the Masses
    We oppose the phenomenon of cadres casually eating and drinking at the expense of the masses and accepting gifts from them.
    After the land reform review was completed in Baiyu Township, Third District, Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, village cadres led dozens of men and women, playing musical instruments, lighting firecrackers, and holding a banner embroidered with "Hard Struggle, Happiness for the People," to send the review team cadres back to the county. Recently, Xiangxiang County held a cadre conference to deploy the review, and after inspection, it was found that similar situations were numerous. For example, after the land reform review was completed in Xishan County, First District, the masses treated the cadres to wine and meals, and some even gave them toothbrushes and toothpaste. Another example is Hu Zili, a cadre of the Seventh District, who participated in land reform in Jinping Township. The masses gave him
    some things, which were called "Glorious Couplets," "Glorious Doves" (peaceful white doves), "Glorious Shoes," "Glorious Meat," and so on. This phenomenon is quite common.
    We believe that all regions should pay attention to correcting and preventing these phenomena.

    湘乡县参加土地改革的干部不应该吃群众酒饭接受礼物
    编辑同志：我们反对干部随便吃群众酒饭、接受群众礼物的现象。
    湖南省湘乡县三区白圫乡土地改革复查完成后，乡村干部领着几十个男女群众，敲着乐器，燃着鞭炮，举着绣上“艰苦奋斗，为民幸福”的锦旗，把复查组干部送到县里。最近，湘乡全县开了布置复查的干部大会，经过检查，发现类似的情况很多。如一区溪山县土地改革复查完成后，群众请干部吃了酒、饭，有的还送了牙刷、牙膏。又如七区区干部胡自立在锦屏乡参加土地改革，群众送了他
    一些东西，这些东西被称为“光荣对联”、“光荣鸽子”（和平白鸽）、“光荣鞋”、“光荣肉”等等。这种现象是相当普遍的。
    我们认为各地应注意纠正并防止这些现象。
