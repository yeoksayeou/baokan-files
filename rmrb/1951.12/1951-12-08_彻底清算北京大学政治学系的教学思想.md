Professor Qian Duansheng said: "Not long ago... I thought that seven or eight years ago, I had abandoned old democracy and individualism." Now he "suddenly realized" that he "was wrong, greatly wrong." He also said: "An old intellectual like me is by no means so easy to transform. If the old is not removed first, the new cannot come in. And what is old and bad is often unclear to oneself." (See People's Daily, November 6th) Mr. Qian is the Dean of the Law School of Peking University and also a professor in the Department of Political Science. The question he raised is not just his own problem, but also my problem, and also the common problem of the teachers of the Law School. Therefore, I would like to express some personal opinions on the questions raised by Mr. Qian. Today, I will only reveal some of the shortcomings of the Department of Political Science as an introduction, hoping that everyone will launch serious criticism and self-criticism on these and other related issues.

	The Department of Political Science Before Liberation

In China under the rule of the Kuomintang, the Departments of Political Science at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools were monopolized by British and American bourgeois democrats. There, people learned Plato's "Republic," Locke's and Rousseau's "Social Contract," Montesquieu's, Bentham's, and Mill's "Parliamentary System," and the reactionary bourgeoisie of England, the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland’s "Party Politics," "Constitution," "Administration," and "Diplomacy," etc. As far as the Department of Political Science is concerned, the so-called "old democracy" refers to these.

Twelve years ago, Wang Tieya, Lou Bangyan, Wu Enyu, and I returned from studying in the United Kingdom. That was the most acute period of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in China, that is, the most rampant period of crazy fascism. Like our teachers, we only knew how to "swallow foreign things whole." We brought the lies of the Labour Party's Raski, a running dog raised by imperialism, from England to semi-colonial and semi-feudal China. We promoted the kind of "socialism" and "cosmopolitanism" that the British and American monopoly bourgeoisie used to deceive the proletariat and the colonial people. We imprisoned many potentially progressive young intellectuals in the so-called formula of "economic equality; political freedom." In this way, we completed a shameful task for imperialism and its running dogs: that is, under the banner of that fake "socialism" and false democracy, we "comforted" and paralyzed the wavering, revolution-fearing petty bourgeoisie; "pulled them backward" to face the side of imperialism and the side of the reactionaries with us. We also trained a group of bureaucrats and secret agents for the Kuomintang reactionaries in this way. The education of the Department of Political Science thus embodied the imperialist cultural and ideological aggression against the Chinese people more concretely with each generation.

We peddled fake goods and "opium" from the West to poison young people, which was inseparable from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal political economy of old China. Take me as an example. I was born into a Christian family, and my parents were hired laborers in the city and countryside. I suffered from feudal oppression in my childhood. Two paths were placed before me: one was the path prepared by advanced elements, that is, the path to liberate all the exploited and oppressed people, and also to liberate oneself; the other was the path prepared by imperialism and the Kuomintang, that is, to "first mold oneself into a great talent" and then exploit and oppress people. I chose the second path. The so-called "first mold oneself into a great talent," as I understood it at the time, meant "to stand out from the crowd." The so-called "stand out from the crowd," as I understand it now, is nothing more than climbing on the heads of the people, becoming the ruler of the people, and using exploitation and oppression to solve my own poverty and satisfy my own "peace, wealth, and honor." From this starting point, I was captured by imperialism and its running dogs in China: I relied on the American church and studied hard at a church school; I was admitted to the Department of Political Science at Tsinghua University; I passed the "Boxer Indemnity Scholarship"; I turned to the reactionary ruling class; I once served as a bureaucrat of the reactionaries. At this point, I was completely consistent with imperialism and its running dogs. I changed from an exploited and oppressed person to an exploiter and oppressor. Thus, I completely lost my future.

There are not a few people like me. What they say is "democracy" and "socialism," but in reality, they serve imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Everything for oneself—individualism. This is the formula of thought and life for many returned students. This formula embodies the thinking of the professors of the Department of Political Science before liberation.

	The Two Years Since Liberation

The founding of the People's Republic of China has opened up broad prospects for the development of the Chinese people's cultural and educational undertakings. For two years, the people have been expecting us to wake up, and the students have also made new demands on us—curriculum reform. We ourselves also feel the need to relearn.

After liberation, our teaching content could not and should not be that deceptive "democracy" and "socialism" anymore, but should be Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which have brought victory and happiness to the Chinese people. This is what everyone understands. Therefore, under the leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the school, the curriculum of the Department of Political Science has undergone some reforms.

But what kind of reforms have we carried out in the past two years?

First, the names of the courses have been changed, but the content of the courses has basically not changed or has changed very little. "History of Western Political Thought" has been changed to "History of State Theories," but what is still being taught are the stories of Plato, Aristotle, and Rousseau; "Comparative Government" has been changed to "Capitalist Countries," but what is mainly being taught is still the party politics and government organizations of Britain, France, and the United States, and the essence of monopoly capitalism and fascism built on this economic foundation has not been revealed; "Public Administration" has been changed to "Administrative Organization and Management," but what is still being taught are some fragmentary and one-sided knowledge about organization, personnel, documents, and materials. Other courses such as "International Law" and "Constitution" still maintain the old set of content.

Second, in teaching, we can only mechanically copy a little bit of things from books, and what we copy is also pitifully small and unsystematic. Sometimes, we even use the writings of right-wing social democrats such as Raski, the enemy of the people, to do the so-called work of "criticizing capitalist countries."

Third, in the process of curriculum reform, we have opened a lot of new courses, such as "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," "Socialist Countries," "Local People's Governments," etc. But these courses are either not taught by anyone, or the people who teach them have not conducted good research on them.

The reform work of the Department of Political Science has been carried out so slowly and so little, and there is a reason for it. It is inseparable from the old historical tradition of Peking University.

But some professors are unwilling to admit this fact. They believe that our reforms have been carried out quite quickly and quite a lot, and that we have made good achievements. I don't think this is in line with the actual situation. I think that if this ideological obstacle is not removed, we will not be able to move forward. We should admit that we are unfamiliar with scientific socialism, that the education we received in the past was thoroughly bourgeois, and that we still more or less adhere to bourgeois reactionary ideas. We should admit that we still lack the analytical ability of dialectical materialism and historical materialism for the status quo, for history, and for new things. The methods we use are generally still bourgeois methods of thinking. We should admit that the reform work we have done in the past two years is only some formalistic reforms. What the people need is not this kind of reform, but a thorough reform.

A person who treats dialectical materialism and historical materialism solemnly should be humble and cautious. But some professors in our department have an incorrect attitude towards their so-called "foreign knowledge." They believe that although they do not have revolutionary struggle experience and do not understand Chinese issues, they have "foreign knowledge" and have ways to deal with foreign issues. Therefore, they regard themselves as "theoreticians" of international issues and advocate so-called "British experts" and "French experts" among the students. The people do not want "theoreticians" like us. What the people want are real theoreticians, theoreticians who combine Marxism with Chinese reality.

Chairman Mao long ago pointed out a way for people engaged in theoretical work: "Return to practical research." (See "Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing," page 7) In the past two years, we have had many opportunities to connect with reality, but because of being satisfied with that formalistic reform, some professors do not pay attention to the assistance given to us by government departments over the past year; they also adopt an indifferent attitude towards the issue of how to train cadres for state power work, believing that it is the task of short-term training courses.

They say in words that theory should be consistent with practice, but in action, they adhere to that basic principle of the bourgeoisie: the separation of theory and practice. This is the ideological status quo of the professors in the Department of Political Science.

	Where is the Key to the Problem?

The key to the fact that the teaching work of the Department of Political Science has improved so slowly and so little is definitely not "the lack of teaching materials." The treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is extremely rich in theories about the state, theories about class struggle, and strategies and tactics of the Chinese revolution. The same is true for the work of political power. The problem is that we do not like to learn new things, or we are not good at learning, or we do not learn hard enough.

The key to the problem is definitely not "the lack of professorship to hire" (there are many revolutionaries who have been tempered for a long time in our country), but that we overestimate our own "academic authority" and underestimate the experience of revolutionary struggle. Except for Dean Qian Duansheng, Professor Xu Deheng, and Professor Wu Zhichun, the rest of the professors in the department are all graduates of Tsinghua University, have all studied in the United Kingdom, and are all students of Raski. In this way, we have formed a small clique. We do not welcome people from outside the school and new forces to join our department. We look down on people. We shut ourselves up to read our own books, hoping to have "only one branch, no other stores." At the same time, it must also be pointed out here that within our small clique, there have been long-term unprincipled disputes, each with their own "thoughts," which have affected the work. On this point, each of us must take responsibility.

The key to the problem is definitely not "the lack of opportunities to connect with reality." The People's Government has prepared various conditions for us. For example, in the report "On the Situation and Current Tasks of Political and Legal Work" by Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government on May 11, 1951, there is a clause: "Assistance should be given to the curriculum reform of the political and legal departments of various universities." Therefore, I oppose the idea of "waiting for the government to unite us, and we do not take the initiative to contact it," which is actually rejecting reform.

The key to the problem is not, as Dean Qian Duansheng of the Law School said: "If the old is not removed first, the new cannot come in." We are not mechanical stage theorists. Old things will not simply disappear on their own, and new things will not simply grow spontaneously. The key to the problem is whether we can carry out ideological transformation from the standpoint of the people.

The fundamental problem is our ideological problem. Therefore, I completely agree with the opinion of Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Education of the Central People's Government. He said: "If the teachers of colleges and universities still adhere to the reactionary ideas of the British and American bourgeoisie, still stubbornly adhere to their own individualism, objectivism, and sectarian views, and cannot be truly transformed, then all reforms of higher education, such as the adjustment of departments, the reform of curriculum, the improvement of teaching methods, etc., will be difficult to carry out and implement, and all decisions and regulations on reforming higher education will inevitably become empty words." (See Study, Volume 5, Issue 1) The experience of the Department of Political Science at Peking University in the past two years fully proves this point.

    彻底清算北京大学政治学系的教学思想
    北京大学政治学系教授  龚祥瑞
    钱端升先生说：“不久以前……我自以为在七八年前，我已经抛弃了旧民主主义和个人主义。”现在他“恍然大悟”，知道“错了，大大地错了”。他又说：“像我这样的一个旧知识分子决不是这样的容易改造得过来的。旧的不先除掉，新的是进不来的。而什么是旧的、坏的，自己往往是模糊不清的。”（见十一月六日人民日报）钱先生是北京大学法学院院长，同时是政治学系的一个教授。他所提出的问题不仅仅是他一个人的问题，也是我的问题，也是法学院教师们共同的问题。因此，我想就钱先生所提出的问题来发表一点个人的意见。今天我就只揭露一些政治学系的缺点，当作引子，希望大家在这些问题及其他有关的问题上，展开认真的批评和自我批评。
    解放前的政治学系
    在国民党统治下的中国，北京大学、清华大学等校的政治学系，为英美资产阶级民主主义者所垄断。在那里，人们学了柏拉图的“理想国”，洛克、卢梭等的“契约论”，孟德斯鸠、边沁、弥尔等的“议会制度”，英、美、法、德、瑞（士）等国反动资产阶级的“政党政治”、“宪法”、“行政”和“外交”等等。就政治学系来说，所谓“旧民主主义”，指的就是这些。
    十二年前，王铁崖、楼邦彦、吴恩裕和我从英国留学回来，那正是国内革命与反革命的斗争最尖锐的时期，即是疯狂的法西斯主义最猖獗的时期。我们和老师一样，只知“生吞活剥地搬外国”。我们把帝国主义所豢养的走狗工党拉斯基的漫天谎话从英国搬到半殖民地半封建的中国。我们宣传了那种英美垄断资产阶级用来欺骗无产阶级和殖民地人民的“社会主义”和“世界主义”。我们使不少可能进步的青年知识分子禁闭在所谓“经济—平等；政治—自由”的公式里。就是这样，我们替帝国主义和它的走狗完成了一个可耻的任务：就是以那冒牌的“社会主义”与假民主主义为旗帜，“安慰”了、麻痹了动摇的、惧怕革命的小资产阶级；“拉着他们倒退”，和我们一道面向帝国主义一边，面向反动派一边。我们也就这样替国民党反动派培养了一批官僚、特务走狗。政治学系的教育就这样一代比一代更为具体地体现了帝国主义对中国人民文化思想的侵略。
    我们从西洋贩了假东西和“鸦片烟”回来，毒害青年，这是和旧中国半殖民地、半封建的政治经济分不开的。拿我来说吧。我出生在一个基督教徒的家庭里，父母是城厢的雇工，我幼年受到了封建主义的压迫。在我面前摆着两条道路：一条是先进分子所预备的道路，就是解放一切被剥削被压迫的人们、同时也解放自己的道路；一条是帝国主义和国民党所预备的道路，就是“先把自己铸成大器”、然后去剥削和压迫人们的道路。我选择了第二条道路。所谓“先把自己铸成大器”，依我当时的了解就是“出人头地”。所谓“出人头地”，依我现时的了解无非就是爬到人民的头上，做人民的统治者，用剥削和压迫的方法来解决我一己的贫困，满足我一己的“安富尊荣”。由此出发，我就被帝国主义和他在中国的走狗所俘掳了：我依赖美国教会，苦苦求读于一个教会学校；我考入清华大学政治学系；我考取了“庚子赔款留学”；我投靠过反动统治阶级；我曾一度充当反动派的官僚。至此，我和帝国主义和他的走狗完全一致了，我从一个被剥削、被压迫者变成一个剥削者、压迫者。于是我完全迷失了自己的前途。
    像我这样的人是不算少的，他们口头上说的是“民主主义”、“社会主义”，实际上是替帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义服务。一切为了自己——个人主义。这是很多留学生从思想到生活的公式。这公式体现了解放以前的政治学系教授的思想。
        解放以来的两年
    中华人民共和国的成立，为中国人民文化教育事业的发展开辟了广阔的道路。两年来，人民期待着我们的觉醒，学生也向我们提出了新的要求——课程改革，我们自己也感到有重新学习的必要。
    解放以后我们的教学内容东西不可能也不应该再是那个骗人的“民主主义”“社会主义”了，而应该是这个给中国人民带来了胜利和幸福的马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想。这是大家都明白了的。因此，在中央人民政府教育部和学校的领导下，政治学系的课程有了一些改革。
    但两年来，我们进行了一些什么样子的改革呢？
    第一，课程的名称改了，而课程的内容基本上没有变革或者很少变革。“西洋政治思想史”改为“国家学说史”，但所讲的仍旧是柏拉图、亚理斯多德、卢梭的故事；“比较政府”改为“资本主义国家”，但所讲的主要部分仍旧是英国、法国、美国的政党政治和政府组织，而对于垄断资本主义以及建筑在这个经济基础上的法西斯主义的本质没有加以揭露；“行政学”改为“行政组织与管理”，但所讲的仍旧是关于组织、人事、文书、物料的一些零碎的片面的知识。其他的课程如“国际公法”、“宪法”，在内容上仍然保持着旧的一套。
    第二，在教学上我们只能从书本上生吞活剥地搬用一点东西，而所搬的也是可怜得很，没有系统。有时，甚至拿人民的敌人拉斯基等右翼社会民主党人所写的东西来做所谓“批判资本主义国家”的工作。
    第三，在课程改革的进行中，我们开列了不少新课程，如“马列主义基础”、“社会主义国家”、“地方人民政府”等等。但这些课程，不是没有人来教，就是教的人对它没有很好地进行过研究。
    政治学系的改革工作进行得这样的慢和这样的少，是有原因的，它和北京大学旧的历史传统分不开的。
    但是有些教授却不愿意承认这个事实。他们认为我们的改革已经进行得相当的快，相当的多，并且有了很好的成绩。我以为这是不符合实际情况的。我以为这个思想障碍如不去除，我们是不能前进的。我们应该承认我们对于科学的社会主义是陌生的，我们过去所受的教育彻头彻尾是资产阶级的，我们至今或多或少地还服膺着资产阶级反动思想。我们应该承认，我们对于现状，对于历史，对于新鲜事物还缺乏辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的分析能力。我们使用的方法一般地还是资产阶级的思想方法。我们应该承认，两年来我们所做的改革工作仅仅是一些形式主义的改革。人民所需要的不是这样子的改革，而是彻底的改革。
    一个郑重地对待辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的人，应该是谦虚的谨慎的。但是我们系里的有些教授对自己的所谓“外国知识”却抱有一种不正确的态度。他们认为自己虽然没有革命的斗争经验，对中国问题不了解，但是却有“外国知识”，搞外国问题是有办法的。因此以国际问题的“理论家”自居，并在同学中提倡什么“英国专家”、“法国专家”……。人民不要像我们这样的“理论家”。人民所要的是真正的理论家，是马克思主义与中国实际相结合的理论家。
    毛主席早就对从事理论工作的人指出了一个办法：“回到实际研究中去。”（见“整顿学风、党风、文风”第七页）两年来我们联系实际的机会是很多的，但是由于满足于那种形式主义的改革，有些教授对政府业务部门一年来所给予我们的协助是不加以重视的；对于如何培养国家政权工作干部的问题也采取置之不理的态度，他们认为那是短期训练班的任务。
    口头上说理论要和实际一致，而在行动上却服膺着那条资产阶级的基本原则：理论和实际分离。这便是政治学系教授的思想现状。
    问题的关键在那里
    政治学系的教学工作改进得这样的慢和这样的少，关键决不在于“没有教材”。关于国家的学说，关于阶级斗争的理论，关于中国革命的战略和策略，在马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的宝库里是丰富极了。关于政权工作也是这样。问题在于我们对新东西不喜欢学习，或者不善于学习，或者学得不够努力。
    问题的关键决不在于“没有可聘的教授”（久经锻炼的革命家在我们的国家里是很多的），而在于我们把自己的“学术权威”估计得过高，把革命斗争经验估计得过低。系里除钱端升院长、许德珩教授和吴之椿教授外，其余教授都是清华大学毕业生，都曾到过英国留学，又都是拉斯基的门生。就是这样，我们结成了一个小小的宗派。我们不欢迎校外的人士和新力量加入到我们系里来。我们看不起人家。我们关起门来读自己的书，希望“只此一家，别无分店”。同时，这里还必须指出，在我们这个小小的宗派里，曾长期存在着无原则的纠纷，各怀“心思”，影响了工作。在这一点上，我们每个人都是要负责任的。
    问题的关键决不在于“得不到联系实际的机会”。人民政府已为我们准备了种种条件。例如，一九五
    一年五月十一日中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会彭真副主任在“关于政法工作的情况和目前任务”的报告中，就有“对各大学政法学系课程改革，应予以协助。”一条。因此，我反对“等待政府来团结我们，我们不主动与之联系”的那种实际上是拒绝改革的思想。
    问题的关键也不在像法学院钱端升院长所说：
    “旧的不先除掉，新的是进不来的。”我们不是机械的阶段论者。旧东西是不会简单地自行消灭的，新东西也不是简单地自流自发生长的。问题的关键就在于我们能不能站在人民的立场上进行思想改造了。
    根本问题是我们的思想问题。因此，我完全同意中央人民政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长的意见。他说：“如果高等学校的教师们还是服膺着英美资产阶级的反动思想，还是固执着自己的个人主义、客观主义和宗派观点，而得不到确实的改造，那么一切高等教育的改革工作，诸如院系的调整、课程的改革、教学法的改进等等，都是难于进行和贯彻的，一切关于改革高等教育的决定和规章就难免成为具文。”（见学习第五卷第一期）两年来北京大学政治学系的经验完全证明了这一点。
