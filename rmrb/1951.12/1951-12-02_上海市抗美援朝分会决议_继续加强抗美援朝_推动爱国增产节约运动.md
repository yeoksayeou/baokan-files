Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th: The Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch passed a resolution on continuing to strengthen Shanghai's Anti-American and Aid-Korea work at its fifth expanded meeting held on the 27th. More than 120 people attended the meeting, including members of the Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch and representatives of anti-American and aid-Korea branches from various districts and sectors of the city. At the meeting, Ma Yinchu, a representative of the Chinese people who attended the Second Session of the World Peace Council, and Jin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch, conveyed the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council and the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, respectively. Then the meeting began to discuss the continued strengthening of anti-American and aid-Korea work. Chen Yisheng, Shen Han, Lu Yudao, Wu Yun Chu, Xie Renbing and other members and representatives spoke successively. They unanimously agreed that the people of all circles in Shanghai have achieved great success in the anti-American and aid-Korea movement. Four hundred and seventeen fighter planes alone have been donated. However, the people of Shanghai must not be satisfied with the victories they have achieved and become complacent. They must make persistent efforts to consolidate and develop the struggle against America and aid Korea. The meeting passed a resolution on strengthening the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The resolution stipulates that, in addition to continuing to mobilize manpower, materials and financial resources to support the Korean front, and continuing to deepen the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch will jointly promote a large-scale patriotic production increase and economy practice movement and ideological remolding movement with the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and summarize the experience of the city's weapon donation movement and evaluate and commend activists in the donation movement. The resolution also stipulates that mass comfort activities will continue to be carried out around the New Year and Spring Festival, and patriotic pacts will be universally checked and revised around the end of the year. Patriotic pact exhibition will be used to continue to deepen the patriotic pact movement. The resolution also stipulates that we will continue to assist the people's government in implementing the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and assist the Three-Self Reform and Anti-Imperialist Patriotic Movement of the religious circles, in order to thoroughly eliminate all special agent spies of U.S. imperialism in China.

In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of the Shanghai Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch, the meeting also re-elected the leading body, electing Liu Changsheng as chairman, and Sheng Pihua, Xia Yan, Ba Jin, Jin Zhonghua, Liu Hongsheng, and Wang Yunsheng as vice chairmen. Finally, the meeting passed telegrams to the Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association and the Chinese People's Volunteers, reporting the achievements of the people from all walks of life in Shanghai in overfulfilling the original donation plan, and reporting that the people of the city are now implementing their patriotic enthusiasm into various tasks centered on "increasing production and practicing economy."
