    Comrade Panchen Erdeni and all friends of the Panchen Kampus:
    I am ordered by Chairman Mao to represent Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and the Northwest Military and Political Committee to bid farewell to Panchen Erdeni on his return to Tibet. I feel particularly excited and happy.
    Panchen Erdeni, like the Dalai Lama, enjoys high respect among the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people have been constantly missing Panchen during the twenty-eight years he has been away from Tibet. Panchen's return to Tibet this time will surely be warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people. This is the inevitable result of the Central People's Government reaching an agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and another great joyous event following the peaceful liberation of Tibet. This shows that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni have united; and all the people of Tibet have united. From now on, all ethnic groups in our motherland will be closely united. Not only the Tibetan people are jubilantly celebrating this situation, but the people of the whole country are also jubilantly celebrating it.
    The territory of Tibet is an inseparable part of the motherland's beautiful mountains and rivers, and the Tibetan people are an inseparable part of the flesh and blood of the people of the motherland. But do not forget the painful lessons of how the reactionary ruling class of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, imperialism and their running dogs—the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—exhausted all means to create disunity within the Tibetan people and disunity between the Tibetan nationality and other nationalities in the interior. It was precisely because of the above-mentioned disunity that imperialism was given an opportunity to invade our motherland. Although the past history will never return, imperialism still exists in the world, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has not been completely eliminated. This requires us to continue to closely and constantly be vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage activities.
    The agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet is the only correct path for the Tibetan people to begin to get rid of darkness and suffering and move towards light and happiness. I hope and believe that after Panchen Erdeni returns to Tibet, he will be able to unite more closely with the Dalai Lama under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, faithfully implement all the provisions of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, so as to eradicate imperialist influence, consolidate the national defense, promote the continuous development and progress of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture, and strive to build a glorious and splendid new Tibet!
    I wish you all a safe journey!
    I wish Panchen Erdeni good health!

    在青海省各族各界欢送班禅返藏大会上
    习仲勋同志的讲话班禅额尔德尼先生并班禅行辕全体朋友们：
    我奉毛主席命令，代表毛主席和中央人民政府并代表西北军政委员会前来欢送班禅额尔德尼先生回藏。我感到特别兴奋和愉快。
    班禅额尔德尼先生如同达赖喇嘛一样，在西藏人民中的信仰是很高的，班禅先生离藏二十八年间，西藏人民时刻在怀念着。班禅先生此次返回西藏，一定会受到西藏人民的热烈欢迎。这是中央人民政府对和平解放西藏取得了协议的必然结果，是接着和平解放西藏之后的又一件大喜事。这说明西藏在毛主席和中央人民政府正确领导下，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼两位先生已经团结起来了；全西藏的人民团结起来了。从此，我们祖国的各民族都亲密地团结起来了。对于这种情形，不仅西藏人民在欢欣鼓舞地祝贺着，全国人民同样在欢欣鼓舞地祝贺着。
    西藏领土是祖国锦绣山河不可割裂的一部分，西藏人民是祖国人民血肉不可分离的一部分。但是不要忘记满清反动统治阶级、帝国主义及其走狗——蒋介石匪帮，曾用尽许多办法来制造西藏人民内部不团结、制造西藏民族同内地其他各民族间不团结的惨痛教训。正由于有了上述不团结现象，才给了帝国主义侵略我们祖国以可乘之隙。过去的历史虽然一去不复返了，可是帝国主义在世界上还存在，蒋介石反动派尚未彻底消灭，这就要求我们仍然要继续严密地、经常地警惕敌人的阴谋破坏活动。
    和平解放西藏办法的协议，是西藏人民开始摆脱黑暗和痛苦、走向光明和幸福的唯一正确道路。我希望并且相信：班禅额尔德尼先生回藏后，一定能够在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，同达赖喇嘛更加紧密团结，并在人民解放军协助下，忠实地执行和平解放西藏办法的协议全部规定，为根除帝国主义影响，为巩固祖国边防，为促进西藏政治、经济、文化各方面不断获得发展和进步，为建设一个辉煌灿烂的新西藏而奋斗！
    祝各位一路平安！
    祝班禅额尔德尼先生身体健康！
