(Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 5th) TASS dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee held an afternoon meeting on December 4th to discuss the appointment of the United Nations Commission on Germany. Soviet Representative Malik made the following speech during the discussion:

When discussing the proposal by the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, to include the issue of Germany on the agenda of the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation opposed including this proposal on the agenda, both in the General Committee and in the plenary session of the General Assembly. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the suggestion to establish a so-called international commission to conduct investigations under United Nations supervision in West Germany, Berlin, and the German Democratic Republic to determine the practical possibilities of holding free elections under the existing conditions in these regions was hypocritical and far-fetched.

In doing so, we pointed out that the superficial efforts for a unified Germany mentioned in the explanatory memorandum of the three countries were absolutely unconvincing and untenable. They said that for this purpose, a so-called international commission would be established to investigate the conditions for holding all-German elections. We have also cited many examples proving that the overall policy of the three countries towards Germany is to keep Germany in a state of long-term division. This division was initiated by them several years ago, violating the interests of the German people and violating the interests of strengthening peace and the security of all nations, and they are still persisting in implementing it.

    **The US, Britain, and France are undermining international agreements, implementing policies of dividing Germany and rearming West Germany**

Correctly speaking, the day after the Potsdam Agreement was signed, the three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, began to adopt a policy of undermining the Potsdam Agreement and preparing for a new war with the participation of West Germany. It should be mentioned that the Potsdam Agreement was violated as early as 1946 when the Saar region was made an economic part of France. They continued to adopt this policy, and then the Anglo-American "Joint Zone" was established, West Germany was brought into the Marshall Plan in 1947, and in the summer of 1948, the three countries put forward the London Recommendations on the West German issue, and in June 1948, a separate currency was issued in West Germany.

This indicated the division of Germany and a serious violation of the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements by the Western countries. The next step in dividing Germany was the decision made by the three countries in Frankfurt to establish a separate West German government, promulgate the Ruhr Statute, and implement the Occupation Statute.

In 1950, the separate state of West Germany joined the so-called European Parliament—an auxiliary political organization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finally, as indicated in the communiqué issued on September 19, 1950, the issue of organizing the West German army and re-militarizing West Germany became the main issue at the meeting of the foreign ministers of the US, Britain, and France held in New York in the autumn of 1950.

Considering the importance of fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism, the Soviet government proposed that the foreign ministers of the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union meet to discuss the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism.

The meeting of foreign ministers' deputies held from March to June 1951 to formulate the agenda for the four-power foreign ministers' meeting showed that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, were not trying to ease the situation in Europe, but were trying to further deteriorate it by stubbornly refusing to include the Soviet proposal on eliminating German militarism and preventing German re-militarization and other proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation on the agenda of the foreign ministers' meeting.

Everyone knows that the representatives of the three countries disrupted the work of the foreign ministers' deputies meeting. They attempted to force the Soviet delegation to accept their conditions, not to include any important issues on the agenda, and attempted to pass regulations that would allow them to implement the policy of rearming West Germany and preparing for a new war in the future without any restrictions.

The Ruhr issue—the main base of German arms production, an important industrial base of German militarism—occupies a special position in the Western countries' policy towards Germany. The Soviet Union had proposed establishing four-power control over the Ruhr industrial area to use the Ruhr's resources to develop German civilian industry and meet the needs of the people of European countries that had been invaded by Germany. Based on their policy of dividing Germany and rearming West Germany, the three countries included the Ruhr area in the so-called Schuman Plan.

According to this plan, the Ruhr area will be economically separated from Germany, the sovereignty of the German people over this extremely important area will be deprived, and the Ruhr resources will be controlled by American monopoly capital and the headquarters of the US military stationed in Europe. This completed the policy of separating the Ruhr that the United States began to implement after the implementation of the so-called Ruhr Statute.

The Western three countries' participation of West Germany in the "Schuman Plan" seriously violated the Potsdam Resolution on establishing a unified, democratic, and non-militarized Germany, because the purpose of this plan is to accelerate the re-militarization of West Germany and establish a war industrial base in Europe for the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

These are some undeniable facts about the policy of division and rearmament of Germany that the three countries are implementing. The reason why the US, Britain, and France raised the issue of Germany in the United Nations is to prevent the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and independent Germany.

    **The US, Britain, and France's forcing the UN to discuss the German issue is a serious violation of the UN Charter**

The Western proposal to establish a United Nations Commission on Germany is completely unfounded, because this issue is not within the jurisdiction of the United Nations and cannot be discussed by the United Nations General Assembly.

It should be pointed out that many international agreements signed by representatives of major powers clearly stipulate that in order to consider and resolve the German issue, it must be done in accordance with the procedures stipulated in these agreements. These agreements include: the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements on the German issue, the resolutions of the European Advisory Commission on the German occupation zone, the agreement on the German Control Mechanism, the declaration of the four governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on defeating Germany and assuming supreme power over Germany, and other decisions reached by the Allied Control Council for Germany.

All these international agreements have determined that the post-war resolution of the German issue is within the jurisdiction of the four countries, and they are responsible for the fate of Germany.

It should be particularly pointed out that, according to the resolution of the Potsdam Conference, the countries occupying Germany "will agree among themselves on other necessary measures that are currently or will be taken in the future to ensure that Germany will never again threaten its neighbors or global peace."

The Potsdam Resolution also stipulates: "In accordance with the agreement on the organization for the control of Germany, the exercise of supreme power within Germany shall be granted to the commanders-in-chief of the four countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France within their respective occupation zones, in accordance with the orders of their respective governments; ... jointly handle general matters related to the entire Germany. (I particularly emphasize joint handling)."

The declaration of Germany's surrender signed by the representatives of the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on June 5, 1945, stated that the governments of the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France "assume supreme power over Germany." In order to exercise these powers, the above-mentioned four governments "will take measures that they deem necessary for future peace and security, including completely disarming Germany and eliminating militarism." Similar provisions are also included in other international agreements on the German issue. Therefore, according to these special international agreements and agreements of the four countries, the entire German issue must be resolved by the countries responsible for the occupation of Germany, and it can only be considered in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the existing international agreements signed by the representatives of the four major powers, and cannot be considered in any other procedure.

This is not the first time that the West has intended to have the United Nations discuss the German issue. The three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, did so at the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly in the autumn of 1948. At that time, regardless of the agreement between the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on Germany and the procedures stipulated by the UN Charter for considering the German issue, they attempted to force the Security Council to adopt their proposals on the German issue. Although they made every effort to distort the clear provisions of Article 107 of the UN Charter that limit the UN's jurisdiction over such issues as Germany, their attempts ultimately failed.

Putting the German issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly according to the suggestions of the three countries will openly and seriously violate Article 107 of the Charter, and thus violate the obligations undertaken in the UN Charter, an international treaty. By forcing the General Assembly to discuss this issue, the three countries violated the obligations they undertook in the Potsdam Agreement and several other agreements related to Germany.

    **The German people support the People's Chamber's proposal to convene an all-German conference to unify the country**

The proposal to appoint an international commission to investigate the conditions for holding elections for the All-German National Assembly under the supervision of the United Nations shows that the governments of the US, Britain, and France consider Germany to be an uncultured, rightless, backward colony, and that it has never had political parties or held elections. The drafters of this proposal believe that the German people are a backward nation, and an international commission must be in charge of them, and this commission must teach the German people how to hold parliamentary elections. This attitude towards Germany can only hurt the national self-esteem of the German people. Needless to say, the Soviet delegation cannot agree with the three countries treating Germany and the German people in this way.

On this point, it should be emphasized that the national movement to strive for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, to oppose the militarization of West Germany, to oppose its incorporation into the North Atlantic aggressive group, and to strive for the early conclusion of a peace treaty is growing stronger day by day in Germany. The German people unanimously support the letter from the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to the Bonn Federal Assembly on September 15 this year—suggesting that an all-German conference be convened with representatives from the German Democratic Republic and representatives from West Germany to discuss two issues: holding free elections for the National Assembly in all of Germany to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany; and speeding up the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

The proposal of the People's Chamber also pointed out that before this, an all-German round table meeting should be convened in order to reach an agreement between West Germany and East Germany; and pointed out that free and democratic elections for the German National Assembly will accelerate the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic pointed out that such elections must be held on the basis of mutual equality throughout Germany; the personal freedom and equality of all citizens must be guaranteed, and all democratic parties and organizations must have equal freedom of activity. The proposal also stipulates that democratic parties and organizations should have the right to propose their own lists of candidates, draw up joint lists, and freely organize election alliances.

Almost two weeks later, on September 27, the Bonn government issued a statement proposing fourteen conditions for accepting the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. The People's Chamber replied that most of the conditions for holding all-German elections proposed by the Federal Assembly were acceptable.

At the special meeting of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on November 2 this year, the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, once again stated that the people of eastern and western Germany are working hard to take the most resolute measures to end the division of Germany and stop the re-militarization of West Germany, so that the people of East and West Germany can embark on the road of vigorous development and strive for a better future—at that time, no country in the world will be threatened by Germany's aggressive ambitions.

The government of the German Democratic Republic suggested that a German election law should be formulated at the all-German conference. At the same time, the People's Chamber authorized the government of the German Democratic Republic to establish a committee to draft the law on free elections for the German National Assembly, so that this law could become the basis for the formulation of the election law at the all-German conference held by representatives of West Germany and East Germany.

According to newspaper reports, the committee established by the German Democratic Republic to draft the election law for free elections for the All-German National Assembly recently held its first meeting. As pointed out in the communiqué of the first meeting of this committee on November 26 this year, representatives of all parties, mass organizations, and groups that make up this committee unanimously stated that the vast majority of people in all parts of Germany believe that the all-German election aimed at rebuilding a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany is the most important and urgent task.

The communiqué then pointed out that the joint statement issued by Adenauer and the foreign ministers of the US, Britain, and France in their Paris meeting was against the will of the German people. The statement said that the United Nations General Assembly must ascertain whether free elections can be held simultaneously in the Federal Republic, Berlin, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.

The German people believe that there is no room for debate on the issue of holding all-German elections, and, as pointed out in the communiqué, the only issue is for representatives of West Germany and East Germany to reach an agreement on the conditions and election law for the election at the all-German conference.

The committee established by the government of the German Democratic Republic believes—as pointed out in the communiqué issued by this committee—that, as for the election law, the election law of the Weimar Republic of March 6, 1924, should be taken as the basis for formulating the election law for all-German elections in order to promote an agreement between the representatives of East and West Germany at the all-German conference. Free, universal, equal, secret, and direct elections must be held on the basis of proportional representation. Elections must be held throughout Germany on an equal footing and with respect for the basic democratic rights of the people. The freedom of all citizens to engage in political activities must be guaranteed. All democratic parties, organizations, and groups must have the same freedom to carry out their activities. They must have the right to nominate candidates for the National Assembly, and candidates have full freedom to campaign. The freedom of the people to express their opinions in words and writing, in images, and in other ways must be guaranteed throughout Germany. The communiqué said: No one should be arrested or persecuted because of his political views, or discriminated against in his career. The freedom of political activity and personal freedom of every candidate for the National Assembly must be guaranteed. After the election law is passed at the all-German conference, all restrictions on citizens' travel between the occupation zones and Berlin must be lifted.

It is clear that if the Bonn government and the three Western occupying countries accept the proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic, it will be an important step towards German unification.

The Bonn government and the three Western occupying countries are implementing a policy of dividing Germany, and they are using all kinds of excuses to reject the just and legitimate proposals of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

It should be pointed out that the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic wrote to the Bonn government on October 10, suggesting that representatives from East and West Germany hold an all-German conference as soon as possible to discuss the issue of holding all-German elections and speeding up the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. However, Adenauer and the Bonn Parliament rejected the proposal of the People's Chamber on October 16 and October 17, respectively.

In a letter to the President of West Germany on November 2, the President of the German Democratic Republic suggested that, in order to seek the peaceful unification of Germany and speed up the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, they should meet to discuss various issues related to convening an all-German conference. In the letter, he also expressed the willingness of the government of the German Democratic Republic to have the Germans themselves investigate the preconditions for holding free elections throughout Germany. This investigation would be carried out by a committee composed of representatives from East and West Germany, under the supervision of representatives from the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France.

The President of West Germany rejected this proposal of the President of the German Democratic Republic.

    **The Soviet Union supports the demands of the German people, advocates the realization of German unification, and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible**

The Soviet government agrees with and supports the proposal put forward by the democratic forces in Germany: to hold all-German elections, elect a National Assembly to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, realize the unification of Germany; and to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, and then withdraw all occupying forces. The Soviet Union believes that the various obstacles preventing the German people from electing representatives should have been eliminated long ago, so that they can hold meetings together to discuss the important issues of Germany: the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany and the issue of concluding a peace treaty as soon as possible.

It should also be reminded that the Soviet government had suggested at the fifth session of the London Council of Foreign Ministers in the autumn of 1947 that the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany should be started immediately. The Soviet delegation firmly opposed the continued delay of this issue, and said that it was unacceptable to deprive the German people of the right to peaceful and independent existence, and that the issue of a peace treaty with Germany was not only important for Germany, but also important for the people of European countries who are striving to establish lasting peace. The Soviet Union suggested that the governments of the four countries should submit a draft peace treaty with Germany to the Council of Foreign Ministers within two months. However, the Soviet proposal was not supported by the delegations of the US, Britain, and France. The position taken by the US, Britain, and France at the London Conference made it impossible to make any progress on the issue of restoring German unification. In addition, as I have said before, the governments of the three countries have implemented the occupation statute of West Germany, the purpose of which is to replace the peace treaty and extend the occupation system indefinitely.

It must be stated that the Soviet government once again raised the issue of drafting a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference in 1949. The Soviet delegation suggested that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France should submit a draft of the peace treaty with Germany to the Council of Foreign Ministers within three months, and stipulate in the draft that all occupying troops stationed in Germany should be withdrawn within one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty.

The Soviet delegation also suggested that the work of preparing the procedure for the peace treaty with Germany should be completed at that Paris conference. A large part of this work had been completed before. But the Soviet proposal was once again met with stubborn opposition from the three Western countries.

All these facts are sufficient to prove that the three countries are using every means to obstruct the establishment of a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany, and to obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

The fact is very obvious that the reason why the three countries raised the issue of establishing a committee to conduct investigations in Germany at the General Assembly is to obstruct the democratic forces in Germany from establishing a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and to obstruct them from striving for the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The fact is very obvious that the three countries' plan does not stipulate the establishment of a unified Germany. They are urgently re-militarizing West Germany, rebuilding the German regular army commanded by Hitler's generals, and starting to use West Germany's human and material resources to prepare for a new war.

The ruling groups of the US, Britain, and France have already embarked on the road of piecing together aggressive blocs and using the revanchist elements and militarist elements in West Germany for this purpose. Therefore, they are afraid of the unification of Germany, afraid of holding free all-German elections, and unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. The reason why the three countries raised the issue of Germany in the United Nations is to indefinitely delay and obstruct the convening of all-German conferences and the holding of free all-German elections, so that the German people will accept the fait accompli of West Germany joining the North Atlantic aggressive group.

In this regard, I can also recall the words of the West German newspaper "General News Daily" of Lautringer, which said that Chancellor Adenauer never hides in private conversations that he believes that it is harmful to restore the unification of Germany before West Germany is re-militarized and participates in the Western defense system (that is, the North Atlantic aggressive group system).

Mr. Eden has the same idea.

According to a Reuters report on November 21, British Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden concluded the debate on foreign policy in the House of Commons on November 20 in a speech on the German issue: We do not want to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

Obviously, this opinion of Mr. Eden and the British government is the common opinion of the "three countries"—the United States, Britain, and France—because British representatives have repeatedly reiterated in their speeches that they are speaking on behalf of the three countries.

It is very obvious that the reason why the governments of the US, Britain, and France want to establish an international committee on the German issue is to use the United Nations to cover up their aggressive militarist purposes, that is, to prevent German unification, prolong the occupation system, and delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    **The Soviet Union believes that the United Nations has no right to discuss the absurd proposals of the US, Britain, and France**

The Soviet delegation firmly opposes placing the German people under the jurisdiction of an international commission, because this is against the will of the German people and ignores existing international agreements on Germany. The Soviet delegation believes that the establishment of such a committee is an insult to the German people.

For many years, the Soviet government has consistently advocated the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the subsequent withdrawal of all occupying troops from Germany. Because the Soviet government believes that no one can deprive the German people of the right to peacefully unify their country, convene all-German conferences, and hold free elections throughout Germany, as well as their right to sign a peace treaty.

The Soviet government believes that if the Germans think it is necessary, then it is best for the Germans themselves to investigate and decide whether free elections can be held throughout Germany. A committee composed of representatives from East Germany and West Germany should conduct this matter under the supervision of the four occupying countries. The Soviet delegation believes that the United Nations General Assembly is not qualified to discuss this issue, but in fact, the General Assembly is discussing this issue in violation of the UN Charter and existing international agreements. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that it is not possible to support the proposal of the Pakistani representative, because this proposal is directly derived from the proposal of the three countries. Since the proposal of the three countries has been proven to be illegal, neither the General Assembly nor the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly has the right or qualification to discuss this proposal.

As for the proposal of the British and Pakistani representatives to invite representatives of the Bonn government here, the reason why the drafters of the proposal of the three countries (the delegations of the US, Britain, and France) insisted on this invitation is also very obvious. The main reason for intending to invite representatives of the Bonn government is that those who put forward the suggestion to establish the German committee hope to influence the discussion of this issue—this issue was illegally raised by them in the committee and the General Assembly—and hope to use this method to make the discussion more powerful. They intend to use this method to cover up the illegality of this issue, to cover up the serious violation of the UN Charter, the violation of Article 107 of the UN Charter, and the violation of the existing international agreements on the German issue by the Western three countries. That is precisely why they are asking to invite representatives of the Bonn government. Needless to say, such a suggestion is unacceptable.

The Soviet delegation believes that it is best to let the Germans themselves judge whether the preconditions and conditions for holding elections exist; they themselves are able to reach an agreement on the conditions and election law for holding elections. If they think it is necessary, they can even establish a committee. They can judge whether the preconditions for holding elections in Germany exist with the assistance of the four countries responsible for occupying Germany. The Soviet delegation believes that the United Nations General Assembly is not qualified to discuss this issue, but in fact, the General Assembly is discussing this issue in violation of the UN Charter and existing international agreements. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that it is not possible to support the proposal of the Pakistani representative, because this proposal is directly derived from the proposal of the three countries. Since the proposal of the three countries has already proven to be illegal, neither the General Assembly nor the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly has the right or qualification to discuss this proposal.

    在联大特别政委会讨论任命联合国德国问题委员会问题的会议上
    苏联代表马立克关于德国问题的发言
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎五日电：联合国大会特别政治委员会十二月四日下午会议讨论任命联合国德国问题委员会的问题。苏联代表马立克在讨论中发言如下：
    在讨论英、美、法三国提出的把关于德国的议案列入联合国第六届大会议程的问题时，苏联代表团无论在总务委员会或大会全体会议上，都反对把这个议案列入议程。苏联代表团指出，把设立所谓国际委员会在联合国监督下在西德、柏林和德意志民主共和国进行调查以确定在这些地区的现存条件下举行自由选举的实际可能性问题列入议程的建议，是虚伪的和牵强附会的。
    在这样作时，我们曾指出过，三国的说明性的备忘录里所谈到的它们争取统一的德国的那种表面努力，是绝对不能令人信服的，而且是绝对不能成立的。它们说，为了这个目的，就要成立所谓国际委员会以调查举行全德选举的条件。我们也曾列举过许多例子，证明三国对德国的全盘政策就是使德国长期陷于分裂，这种分裂是几年前由它们违反着德国人民的利益，违反着加强和平与各国人民的安全的利益而开始实行，并且现在还在坚持实行着的。
    美英法破坏国际协议，执行分
    裂德国和重新武装西德的政策
    正确地说来，在波茨坦协定签订的第二天，美、英、法三国就开始采取了破坏波茨坦协定的方针，采取了分裂德国并且在西德的参与下准备新战争的方针。应该提一下，早在一九四六年把萨尔区变成法国经济的一部分的时候，波茨坦协定就被破坏了。它们继续采取着这种方针，于是后来就成立了英美“联占区”，一九四七年把西德拉入了马歇尔计划，一九四八年夏天三国提出了关于西德问题的伦敦建议，一九四八年六月在西德单独发行了货币。
    这就表明了德国的分裂，并且是西方国家对雅尔塔与波茨坦协定的严重破坏。下一个分裂德国的步骤就是在法兰克福通过的三国决定，成立西德分裂政府，颁布鲁尔法规，实行占领法规。
    一九五○年，西德分裂国家加入了所谓欧洲议会——北大西洋侵略公约的辅助政治组织。最后，据一九五○年九月十九日发表的公报表明：组织西德军队与把西德重新军国主义化问题成了一九五○年秋天在纽约举行的美、英、法外长会议上的主要问题。
    考虑到履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定的重要性，苏联政府提出了建议美、英、法、苏外长开会讨论履行关于肃清德国军国主义的波茨坦协定的问题。
    一九五一年三月到六月举行的拟定四国外长会议议程的外长助理会议表明：英、美、法三国不是想缓和欧洲局势，而是力图使它进一步恶化，办法就是顽固地拒绝把苏联关于肃清德国军国主义与防止德国重新军国主义化的建议以及苏联代表团提出的其他建议列入外长会议议程。
    大家都知道，三国代表破坏了外长助理会议的工作。他们企图迫使苏联代表团接受他们的条件，不让议程中包括任何重要问题，并企图通过有利于他们的规定，以让他们在将来也能丝毫不受约束地实施重新武装西德和准备新战争的政策。
    鲁尔问题——德国军火生产的主要基地、德国军国主义的重要工业根据地的问题，在西方国家的对德政策中占着特别位置。苏联曾提议对鲁尔工业区建立四国管制，以把鲁尔的资源用来发展德国的民用工业，并满足欧洲曾遭德国侵略的各国人民的需要。三国根据它们分裂德国及重新武装德国西部的政策，把鲁尔区列入了所谓舒曼计划。
    按照这个计划，鲁尔区将在经济上割离德国，德国人民对这个异常重要的地区的主权将被剥夺，鲁尔资源将由美国垄断资本和驻欧美军总部控制。这就完成了美国从实施所谓鲁尔法规之后便开始的割裂鲁尔的政策。
    西方三国使西德参加“舒曼计划”，严重地违反了关于建立统一的、民主的、非军国主义化的德国的波茨坦决议，因为这个计划目的在于加速西德的重新军国主义化，并为北大西洋侵略集团在欧洲建立战争工业基地。
    这便是关于三国正在实行的分裂和重新武装德国的政策的一些无可争辩的事实。美、英、法三国把德国问题在联合国提出，就是企图阻止建立统一的、爱好和平的、独立的德国。
    美英法强使联大讨论德国问题
    是严重违反联合国宪章的行为
    西方建议成立联合国德国问题委员会，是完全没有根据的，因为这个问题不在联合国权限之内，是不能由联合国大会讨论的。
    应该指出，有许多由各大国代表签订的国际协定就明白地规定，要考虑和解决德国问题，必须按照这些协定所规定的程序。这些协定包括：雅尔塔和波茨坦关于德国问题的协定，欧洲顾问委员会关于德国占领区的决议，关于对德管制机构的协定，苏美英法四国政府关于战败德国并担当对德最高权力的宣言，以及对德管制委员会取得协议的其他一些决定。
    这一切国际协定都确定了，德国问题的战后解决在四国权限之内，它们对德国的命运负有责任。
    应该特别指出，按照波茨坦会议的决议，占领德国的国家“将一致协议于目前或未来采取其他确使德国永不再威胁其邻邦或全球和平之必要措施。”
    波茨坦决议又规定：“依照管制德国机构之协定，德国境内最高权力之执行，系由美英苏法四国总司令遵本国政府命令，分别授与各占领区内者；……共同处置有关全德国之一般事件。（我特别强调共同处置这一点）”
    一九四五年六月五日苏美英法四国代表签署的德国投降宣言说，苏美英法四国政府“担当德国的最高权力”，为了行使这些权力，上述四国政府“将采取它们认为未来的和平与安全所必需的措施，包括彻底解除德国武装和肃清军国主义”。在关于德国问题的其他国际协议里也有同样的规定。因此，根据四国这些特别国际协议和协定，整个德国问题必须由负占领德国责任的国家来解决，而且只能按照四大国代表签署的现存国际协议所规定的程序来考虑，不能以任何其他程序来考虑。
    西方打算让联合国也来讨论德国问题，这已经不是第一次了。在一九四八年秋天联合国第三届大会上，美、英、法三国就这样做过。当时，它们不顾美英法苏四国关于德国的协议以及联合国宪章所规定的考虑德国问题的程序，企图强使安全理事会通过它们在德国问题上的建议。它们虽然尽了一切力量，想歪曲联合国宪章第一○七条限制联合国对德国这类问题的权限的明白规定，可是它们的企图终归失败了。
    按照三国建议把德国问题列入联合国大会议程，将公然严重违反宪章第一○七条，因而就违反了在联合国宪章这种国际条约里承担的义务。强迫大会讨论这个问题，三国就违反了它们在波茨坦协定和若干其他和德国有关的协定里承担的义务。
    德国人民拥护人民议会的建议
    要求召开全德会议统一国家
    任命一个国际委员会在联合国监督下调查举行全德国民议会选举的条件的建议，说明美、英、法三国政府认为德国是没有文化的、没有权利的、落后的殖民地，认为它没有过政党，也从来没有举行过选举、这个建议的起草人认为德国人民是落后的民族，非要有一个国际委员会来管他们不可，非要由这个委员会来教德国人民如何举行议会选举不可。这种对待德国的态度只能伤害德国人民的民族自尊心。不用说，苏联代表团是不能同意三国这样对待德国和德国人民的。
    关于这一点，应该强调这个事实：争取建立一个统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国的全国运动，反对西德军国主义化、反对把它并入北大西洋侵略集团、争取尽早缔结和约的运动，正在德国一天一天地壮大起来。德国人民一致拥护今年九月十五日德意志民主共和国人民议会致波恩联邦议会的信件——建议召开有德意志民主共和国代表与西德代表参加的全德会议，讨论两个问题：在全德举行自由的国民议会选举，以建立统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国；加速缔结对德和约。
    人民议会的建议同时指出，在此以前，应该召开全德圆桌会议以便西德与东德间获致协议；又指出举行德国国民议会的自由与民主的选举将加速建立统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国。
    德意志民主共和国人民议会指出，这种选举必须在全德国相互平等的情况下举行；必须保证全体公民的个人自由与平等，保证一切民主党派与组织有同等的活动自由。这个建议同时规定民主党派与组织应有权提出它们自己的候选人名单，拟定联合的名单，并任意组织选举联盟。
    差不多两星期以后，九月二十七日，波恩政府发表声明，提出了接受德意志民主共和国人民议会建议的十四个条件，人民议会回答说，联邦议会提出的举行全德选举的条件，大多数是可以接受的。
    在今年十一月二日德意志民主共和国人民议会的特别会议上，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥再一次表示，德国东部与西部人民正努力采取最坚决的措施来结束德国的分裂，制止西德的重新军国主义化，以便东西德人民能够踏上蓬勃发展的道路，争取美好的未来——到那时，世界上没有国家再会受到德国的侵略野心的威胁了。
    德意志民主共和国政府建议应该在全德会议上拟定德国选举法。同时，人民议会授权德意志民主共和国政府设立委员会以起草举行德国国民议会自由选举的法律，以便这个法律能够成为西德与东德代表举行的全德会议上制定选举法的张本。
    据报纸消息，德意志民主共和国设立的起草全德国民议会自由选举的选举法的委员会，最近举行了第一次会议。像这个委员会今年十一月二十六日第一次会议的公报所指出的，组成这个委员会的一切党派、群众组织和团体的代表曾经一致声明：德国各地绝大多数人民认为目的在于重建统一的、民主的、爱好和平的、独立的德国的全德选举是最重要、最紧急的任务。
    公报然后指出：阿登纳和美、英、法三国外长在他们的巴黎会议公报里所发表的联合声明，是违背德国人民的意志的，那个声明说，联合国大会必须查明能否同时在联邦共和国、柏林、德国苏占区举行自由选举。
    德国人民认为：举行全德选举的问题是没有争辩的余地的，并且，像公报所指出的那样，唯一的问题是西德和东德代表在全德会议上就选举的条件和选举法达成协议。
    德意志民主共和国政府所设立的这个委员会认为——在这个委员会发表的公报里就曾经指出——，至于选举法，应以魏玛共和国一九二四年三月六日的选举法为制订全德选举的选举法的基础，以促使东西德代表在全德会议上取得协议。必须在比例代表制的基础上举行自由的、普遍的、平等的、秘密的和直接的选举。必须在平等的基础上和尊重人民
    一切基本的民主权利的情况下在全德国举行选举。必须保证全体公民有进行政治活动的自由。一切民主党派、组织和团体必须有同样的自由来进行它们的活动。它们必须有权提名国民议会候选人，候选人有充分自由进行竞选。必须在全德保障人民有以口头和文字，以形象的方式和其他方式表示意见的自由。公报说：任何人都不应该因为他的政治观点而受到逮捕或迫害，或者在职业上受到歧视。必须保证国民议会每一个候选人有政治活动自由和人身自由。在全德会议通过了选举法后，必须取消对公民在各占领区和柏林之间来往的一切限制。
    很明白，如果波恩政府和三个西方占领国家接受德意志民主共和国政府的建议，就会是走向德国统
    一的重要的一步。
    波恩政府和三个西方占领国家实行分裂德国的政策，用尽各种藉口拒绝德意志民主共和国政府的公正而合法的建议。
    应当指出的是，德意志民主共和国人民议会十月十日写信给波恩政府，建议东德和西德的代表尽快举行全德会议，以讨论举行全德选举和加速缔结对德和约的问题，可是阿登纳与波恩议会又分别在十月十六日和十月十七日拒绝了人民议会的建议。
    德意志民主共和国总统在十一月二日写给西德总统的信中建议，为了求得德国的和平统一和加速缔结对德和约，他们来开会讨论有关召开全德会议的各项问题。他在信中又表示德意志民主共和国政府愿意由德国人自己来调查在全德国举行自由选举的先决条件，这种调查由东德和西德代表组成的委员会来进行，这个委员会受苏、美、英、法四国代表的监督。
    西德总统拒绝了德意志民主共和国总统的这项建议。
    苏联支持德国人民的要求，主
    张实现德国统一，尽速对德缔和
    苏联政府同意并支持德国民主力量所提出的建议：举行全德选举，选出国民议会以建立统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国，实现德国的统一；以及尽速缔结对德和约，随后并撤退一切占领军。苏联认为阻止德国人民选出代表的种种障碍早就该消除了，以便使他们能够在一起举行会议，讨论德国的重要问题：建立统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国和尽早缔结和约的问题。
    还应该提醒大家，苏联政府曾在一九四七年秋季伦敦第五次外长会议上，建议立即开始草拟对德和约。苏联代表团坚决反对继续拖延这个问题，并且曾说，剥夺德国人民和平独立生存的权利是不可容许的，而且对德和约问题不仅对于德国是重要的，对于为建立持久和平而奋斗的欧洲各国人民也是重要的。苏联建议四国政府应在两个月以内向外长会议提出对德和约草案。可是苏联的建议却没有得到美、英、法三国代表团的支持。美、英、法三国在伦敦会议上所采取的立场，使得关于恢复德国统一的问题无法获得任何进展。另外，正如我曾经说过的，三国政府又实行了西德的占领法规，这个占领法规的目的是代替和约而无限期地延长占领制度。
    必须说明：苏联政府在一九四九年巴黎外长会议上再次提出了尽速草拟对德和约的问题。苏联代表团建议由苏、美、英、法四国政府在三个月内向外长会议提出对德和约的草案，并在草案上规定在和约缔结后一年内撤退驻在德国的一切国家的占领军队。
    苏联代表团又建议在那次巴黎会议上完成准备对德和约的程序的工作。这项工作以前已完成了一大部分。但是苏联的建议那一次又遭到了西方三国的顽固反对。
    这一切事实都足以证明，三国正在用一切办法阻挠建立统一的、民主的、爱好和平的、独立的德国，阻挠缔结对德和约。
    事实十分明显，三国之所以在大会上提出设立委员会以在德国进行调查的问题，是为了要想阻挠德国民主力量建立统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国，阻挠他们争取迅速缔结对德和约。事实十分明显，三国政府的计划中没有规定建立统一的德国，它们正在火急地把西德重新军国主义化，重建由希特勒将领统率的德国正规军，着手利用西德的人力与物质资源准备新战争。
    美、英、法三国的统治集团既已走上了拼凑侵略集团和为了这个目的利用西德的复仇主义分子与军国主义分子的道路，因此害怕德国的统一，害怕举行全德自由选举，不愿意缔结对德和约。三国之所以在联合国中提出德国问题，是要想无限期地拖延并且阻挠召开全德会议和举行全德自由选举，这样使德国人民接受西德加入北大西洋侵略集团的既成事实。
    在这一方面，我还可以追述一下西德报纸劳特林格“一般新闻报”的话，该报说，阿登纳总理私下谈话时从来不隐瞒，他认为在西德重新军国主义化起来之前，在它参加西方防御体系（即北大西洋侵略集团体系）之前，德国恢复统一是有害的。
    艾登先生的想法是一样的。
    据路透社十一月二十一日报道，英国外交大臣艾登先生于十一月二十日在关于德国问题的演说中总结下院外交政策的辩论说：我们不想与德国缔结和约。
    显然，艾登先生和英国政府的这种意见是“三国”——美国、英国、法国——的共同意见，因为英国代表们在他们的演说中屡次重申他们是代表三国发言的。
    这是十分明显的，美、英、法三国政府之所以要成立德国问题国际委员会，是为了用联合国来掩盖它们侵略性的军国主义的目的，也就是为了阻止德国统一，延长占领制度和拖延对德和约的缔结。
    苏联认为联合国无权讨论美英
    法三国的荒谬提案
    苏联代表团坚决反对把德国人民置于国际委员会管辖之下，因为这是违反德国人民的意志和漠视现存的关于德国的国际协定的，苏联代表团认为建立这种委员会是对于德国人民的侮辱。
    许多年来，苏联政府一贯主张建立统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国，早日缔结对德和约及所有占领军队随后撤出德国，因为苏联政府认为没有人能够剥夺德国人民和平统一他们的国家、召开全德会议和在全德国举行自由选举的权利以及他们签订和约的权利。
    苏联政府认为，如果德国人认为必要的话，那末，在全德国是不是能够举行自由选举最好由德国人自己来调查决定，由东德和西德代表组成的委员会在四个占领国家监督下来进行这件事。
    至于三国建议和它们关于成立所谓在联合国监督下的国际委员会在西德、柏林和德意志民主共和国境内进行调查以便判明这些地区的现在局势是否可能举行选举的提案，苏联代表团已经说过，这个建议是毫无理由的，因为这个问题不在联合国各机构管辖权限之内，不能作为联合国大会讨论的题目。
    看一看三国提案，一个人就不得不注意到提案的序文中所指出的三国是根据波恩总理，就是说，根据阿登纳的建议而提出这个提案的。但是阿登纳并不就是德国。阿登纳提出了许多建议并且也承担了好些义务。例如，从报纸上消息来看，他已把德国的重新军国主义化和成立十二师军队的义务担当下来了，这就是说，他已答应把德国炮灰交由美国将军艾森豪威尔指挥。可是，这并不是说这就是德国的意见，德国人民的意见。因此，序言一开始就是有毛病的，因为仅提到某一个波恩总理的建议是不足以在联合国来倡议讨论这个总理的建议的。
    序言又说：鉴于联合国的宗旨和原则。
    “三国”提案的起草人甚至不愿指出他们所指的究竟是一些什么原则，因为联合国的原则和联合国宪章并不容许讨论这个问题。可是，“三国”提案的起草人了解到：他们强使联合国大会讨论这个问题是违反了整个的联合国宪章、特别是宪章第一○七条的。
    序言上又说：……适当地考虑到四国对于德国所应负的义务……。
    这是没有意义的空话。美、英、法三国如果真正是依照现有国际协定，根据联合国宪章第一○七条，适当地考虑了四国对于德国的义务，那末它们就不会把这个问题提交联合国大会讨论了。
    这一切都证明：三国把这个问题提交联合国大会讨论，是没有理由的。
    苏联代表团要反对并且要投票反对通过主张成立侮辱德国人民的非法的国际委员会的任何提案。
    至于英国和巴基斯坦的代表们所提出的主张邀请波恩政府派代表到这里来的提案，三国提案的起草人（美、英、法三国代表团）所以坚持主张这种邀请的原因，也是十分明显的。打算邀请波恩政府代表的主要原因是，提出主张成立德国委员会的建议的人们希望影响这个问题的讨论——这问题是他们在委员会和大会上非法地提出来的——，并希望用这种办法来使得讨论更有力量。他们打算这样来掩饰这个问题的非法性，掩饰西方三国严重破坏联合国宪章、破坏联合国宪章第一○七条、破坏现有关于德国问题的国际协定的行为。他们所以要求邀请波恩政府的代表，正是为了这个缘故。不用说，这样的建议是让人无法接受的。
    苏联代表团认为：最好让德国人自己来判断举行选举的前提和条件是否存在；他们自己是能够在举行选举的条件和选举法上取得协议的。如果他们认为必要，甚至还能够成立委员会。他们能够在负责占领德国的四国的协助下，判断在德国举行选举的先决条件是否存在。苏联代表团认为联合国大会没有资格讨论这个问题，而事实上大会却正在违反联合国宪章和现有国际协定来讨论这个问题，因而苏联代表团认为没有可能支持巴基斯坦代表的提案，因为这个提案是由三国提案直接引伸出来的。三国提案既然已经证明是非法的了，无论大会和大会特别政治委员会，都是没有权利、没有资格讨论这个提案的。
