Scientific Workers Must Stand Firmly on the People's Standpoint
Zhang Jingyue, Provost and Head of the Botany Department of Peking University

    On the anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement in 1950, I wrote a short article for the Peking University commemorative special issue. I began it this way:

    "The May Fourth Movement brought forward 'Mr. Science' along with 'Mr. Democracy.' After some advocacy, practical scientific work began to sprout in Peking University…taking root in this garden."

    After this article was published, it did not receive criticism; on the contrary, some people praised it. This shows that in the school, many people at the time agreed with this view. But today, after a short period of political study, I took this article to the group discussion, and everyone thought that the view of "taking root" was wrong.

    Yes, we did some scientific research. It was done by our own people in our own laboratories. In geology and biological sciences, the materials we used for research were also domestic. But can we say that science has taken root in China? If it had indeed taken root and grown on Chinese soil, it should have become the science of the Chinese people, a part of the people's lives. Our broad masses of people would inevitably enjoy the benefits of this science.

    But what is the reality? We ran to Europe and America, learned some scientific knowledge and technology, and bought a lot of instruments and books from Europe and America to carry out our so-called scientific research. The research results we boast about are irrelevant to the people. They only added some examples to the European and American scientific systems, and most of the works are trivial and insignificant. This kind of work can only be seen as decorating a few flowers on someone else's tree. To be more honest, it is just setting off a few green leaves under other people's flowers. We have not yet planted the seeds of science in Chinese soil, so there is no question of taking root. This kind of science is colonial science, science that serves imperialism.

    The above conclusion can be drawn not only from scientific work in physics, chemistry and the like, but also from scientific work with a high degree of locality. Taking botany as an example, Mr. Qian Chongshu once pointed out that we also served imperialist countries. He said:

    "In recent decades, imperialist countries have successively sent many people to China to investigate plants, using many violent methods to gradually penetrate the inland from the coastal areas. Investigation is the name, but finding out about China's situation is the reality. These situations can be seen in Cox's 'Plant Collecting in China'. Later, when China had botany workers, imperialism spent some money to hire Chinese people to investigate plants, and we ourselves also gave whole batches of plant specimens to foreign countries as gifts. Isn't this serving imperialist countries?" (See "Chinese Botanical Magazine" Volume 6, Issue 1)

    In the past, some plant specimens in China had labels with place names and personal names written in Western phonetic spellings, making it difficult to find out who collected the specimens and where. This matter is absurd from the perspective of independent science, but it is very natural from the point of view of serving European and American imperialists.

    In the two years since liberation, many scientific workers—including myself—still sometimes stand on the side of imperialism in thought and emotion. As a result, we do not distinguish between enemies and friends, and even reverse enemies and friends. To this day, some of us are still obsessed with Europe and America and doubt the Soviet Union. We always find it difficult to accept the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union. On the surface, we say that scientists should not easily believe. In reality, it is resisting acceptance, using excuses to cover up. Otherwise, why do we easily accept European and American science, but do not take the same skeptical attitude? The slow acceptance of the theories of the great Soviet scientists such as Michurin and Lysenko in the Chinese biological science community is a clear example. In the past, I was also one of those who resisted accepting Soviet scientific experience. Through recent ideological remolding study and criticism, I have realized my mistakes.

    We can all understand the truth that science must serve the people. But in actual actions, we often consciously or unconsciously deviate from the people and stand on the side of the enemy. We must work hard to study, improve our political awareness, transform our thinking, and be able to stand firmly on the people's stand in actual actions in order to become true people's scientific workers.

### 科学工作者要站稳人民的立场

    科学工作者要站稳人民的立场
    北京大学教务长兼植物系系主任  张景钺
    一九五○年“五四”周年纪念日，我曾为北京大学纪念特刊写了一篇短文，我是这样开始的：
    “五四运动将‘赛先生’同时和‘德先生’抬
    出来。经过一番提倡，科学实际的工作也就在北
    大萌蘖……在这块园地生了根。”
    这篇文章登出以后，没有受到批评，相反地有人称赞过。足见在学校中，有不少人当时同意这种看法。但在今天，经过短期的政治学习，我把这篇文章拿到小组讨论会上，全体都认为“生根”的看法是错误的。
    是的，我们做了一些科学研究工作。是我们自己人在我们自己的实验室做的。在地质和生物科学中，我们用作研究的材料，也是本国的。但是这样是不是就可以说科学在中国生了根呢？若果然是在中国土地上生了根并滋长起来，就应当成为中国人民的科学，成为人民生活的一部分。我们广大的人民也必然享受到这种科学的益处。
    但实际是怎样呢？我们跑到欧美，学些科学的知识和技术，又向欧美购买了不少的仪器和图书，进行我们的所谓科学研究。我们所夸耀的研究成果，是与人民无关的东西。它们只不过在欧美科学的体系上增加了一些实例，并且大多数的作品是琐碎的无足轻重的。这种工作只能看作在别人的树上点缀了几朵花。若说的更老实些，只是在别人的鲜花下衬托了几片绿叶。我们还不曾将科学的种子种在中国土壤里，当然谈不到生根。这种科学是殖民地的科学，是给帝国主义服务的科学。
    不仅是从物理、化学一类的科学工作中可以得出上述的结论，即是具高度地方性的科学工作也是一样。以植物学为例，钱崇澍先生曾指出我们也是为帝国主义国家服务的。他说：
    “在近几十年来，帝国主义国家陆续派了许多人到中国来调查植物，用了许多强暴方法渐自沿海区域深入内地。调查其名，探听中国情形是实。这些情形自考克斯著的中国植物采集记一书中可以看出。其后中国有了植物学工作者，帝国主义花了些金钱雇佣中国人调查植物，而我们自己也把整批植物标本向外国赠送。这不是为帝国主义国家服务么？”（见“中国植物学杂志”六卷一期）
    过去我们中国有些植物标本上的标签，地名和人名是用西文拼音写的，以致现在难以查出标本是什么人在什么地方采集的。这件事从自主的科学看去是何等荒谬，但从为欧美帝国主义者服务的观点看去，却又是很自然的。
    在解放两年多的今天，许多科学工作者——包括我自己在内，在思想上、情感上有时仍然站在帝国主义的一边。以致敌友不分，甚至敌友颠倒。至今，我们仍有些人迷恋欧美，怀疑苏联。我们对苏联的科学成就总觉不易接受。表面上我们说，科学家不应轻易置信。实际上是抗拒接受，借词掩饰。不然的话，为什么我们对欧美的科学就很容易接受，而不取同样的怀疑态度呢？米邱林、李森科等苏联伟大科学工作者的学说，在中国生物科学界中的接受情形是如此迟缓，就是鲜明的例子。在抗拒接受苏联科学经验的人中，以往我也是一个。经过最近思想改造的学习和批评，使我认识到了我的错误。
    科学要为人民服务，这个真理我们都能理解。但在实际行动中，往往会自觉地或不自觉地脱离人民，站在敌人一边。我们必须努力学习，提高自己的政治觉悟，改造自己的思想，在实际行动中能站稳人民的立场，方可成为真正的人民科学工作者。
