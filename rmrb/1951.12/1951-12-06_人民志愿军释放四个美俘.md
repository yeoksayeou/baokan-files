Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 4th: Our front-line reporter reports: Twenty-two days before Hanley, Chief of the Military Law Department of the U.S. Eighth Army, slandered our army for "killing prisoners," on the evening of October 23rd, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army released four more American prisoners. The four prisoners were Private Smelcer (military ID 56144329), Private Hort (military ID 17267697), Private First Class Radio Operator Park (military ID 12318462), and Corporal Deputy Squad Leader Boyles (military ID 53000866) from the 9th Company of the 35th Regiment of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division.

These four American soldiers were captured during the battle of Western Hill on the central front on September 6th. In the fierce battle, Smelcer broke his right collarbone, Hort and Park suffered severe injuries to their feet and hands, and Boyles suffered severe injuries to his right leg and back. When the American invading army retreated from there, they abandoned them on the battlefield without any pity.

After they were captured, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sent them to the field hospital. In the hospital, they received proper treatment.

Before they were released, they all received cigarettes and a release fee of three U.S. military dollars each. At the time of release, in order to avoid them being killed or injured by the artillery and gunfire of the American invading army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army took them along a safer route and sent them to the area where both the enemy and our side frequently operated; and gave them a white flag to allow them to safely pass through the front lines. The American prisoners of war who remained in the Volunteer Army prisoner camp wrote many letters home and asked them to take them back.

The revolutionary humanitarian prisoner policy of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army deeply moved these four prisoners. Smelcer said: "I am very happy to be able to go home. After I return to my country, I must tell the American people that the Chinese people are friends of the American people, that they are a peace-loving nation, and that they do not want war. At the same time, I must also tell my friends what I know about the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and how kindly they treat prisoners." Boyles said: "You saved my life, and I will never forget it."

    人民志愿军释放四个美俘
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社前线记者报道：在美国第八军军法处处长汉莱污蔑我军“杀害俘虏”的二十二天前，即在十月二十三日的晚上，中国人民志愿军又曾释放了四个美军俘虏。这四个俘虏是美军第二十五师三十五团九连二等兵斯末色尔
    （SMELCER、军号五六一四四三二九）、荷特（HORT、军号一七二六七六九七）、一等兵无线电员派克（PARK、军号一二三一八四六二）和下士副班长波义尔斯（BOYLES、军号五三零零零八六六）。
    这四个美军士兵是在九月六日的中线西方山战斗中被俘的。在激烈的战斗中，斯末色尔被打断了右锁骨，荷特和派克的两足和手部，波义尔斯的右腿及背部都受了重伤。美国侵略军在那里退却时，毫不怜惜地把他们丢弃在阵地上。
    在他们被俘以后，中国人民志愿军的战士把他们送到了战地医院。在医院里，他们得到了妥善的治疗。
    他们在被释放前，都领到了卷烟和每人三元美国军用币的释放费。释放时，中国人民志愿军为了避免他们遭受美国侵略军炮火和枪火的杀伤，带他们沿着较安全的路线，把他们送到敌我双方经常活动的地区；并给他们一面白旗，使他们安全地通过了火线。留在志愿军俘虏营中的美军俘虏写了很多家信，托他们带回去。
    中国人民志愿军的革命人道主义的俘虏政策使这四个俘虏很受感动。斯末色尔说：“我能回家去非常高兴。我回国后一定要告诉美国人民，中国人民是美国人民的朋友，他们是一个爱好和平的民族，他们不要战争。同时，我也一定要把我所了解的中国人民志愿军和他们如何宽待俘虏的情形告诉我的朋友们。”波义尔斯说：“你们救了我的性命，这我是一辈子也忘不了的。”
