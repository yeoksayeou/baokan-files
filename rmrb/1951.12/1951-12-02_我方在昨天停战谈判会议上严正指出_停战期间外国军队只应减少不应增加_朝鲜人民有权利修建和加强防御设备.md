　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st – At the meeting of the delegations of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations on December 1st, our side continued to refute the other side's so-called suggestion of allowing foreign troops to be replaced on a one-for-one basis during the ceasefire, the so-called suggestion of prohibiting the increase of military equipment, the so-called suggestion that the supervisory body has the right to freely enter and leave all parts of Korea, and the other side's absurd demand to retain armed forces on islands in our rear during the ceasefire. Under repeated questioning from our representative, the other side admitted that the so-called suggestion of allowing foreign troops to be replaced during the ceasefire was the rotation system of the US military, which the other side had repeatedly promoted before the ceasefire negotiations in order to continue the war, and that the so-called suggestion of prohibiting the increase of military equipment was to restrict the construction of our airfields. Our representative sternly pointed out that during the military armistice, all foreign troops should not only not increase, but should only decrease. All foreign troops only have the reason to withdraw from Korea, and no reason to enter Korea. During the military armistice, in order to prevent the other side from carrying out indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns in Korea again, the Korean people have every right to build and strengthen defense facilities, including the construction of airfields, and no one is allowed to interfere in the slightest. Our representative continued to point out that the other side's so-called suggestion that the supervisory body has the right to freely enter and leave all parts of Korea is only aimed at directly interfering in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the other side's request to retain armed forces on islands in our rear directly violates the agreement on the military demarcation line in the second agenda item, making hostile acts possible to break out again at any time. The other side avoided directly answering the accusations made by our representative, but insisted on its unreasonable suggestions and demands. Our representative once again suggested that the delegation meeting quickly reach a principled agreement based on our full and reasonable five-point principled suggestions for the third agenda item, and agree on detailed regulations, so as to enter the discussion of the issue of prisoners of war as soon as possible.

　　我方在昨天停战谈判会议上严正指出
　　停战期间外国军队只应减少不应增加
　　朝鲜人民有权利修建和加强防御设备
　　【新华社开城一日电】十二月一日的朝鲜停战谈判的双方代表团会议上，我方代表继续驳斥对方所谓允许外国军队在停战期间在一对一的基础上进行替换的建议，所谓禁止军事设备的增加的建议，所谓监督机构有权自由出入朝鲜一切部分的建议，以及对方在停战期间保留武装部队在我方后方的岛屿上的荒谬要求。在我方代表的一再质问之下，对方承认所谓允许外国军队在停战期间进行替换的建议就是对方在停战谈判前所一再宣传的为了继续进行战争的美军的轮换制度，所谓禁止军事设备的增加的建议就是限制我方飞机场的修建。我方代表严词指出：在军事停战期间，一切外国军队不仅不应增加，而且只应减少。一切外国军队只有撤出朝鲜的理由，而没有任何进入朝鲜的理由。在军事停战期间为了防止对方对朝鲜的和平城镇再度施行狂轰滥炸，朝鲜人民有一切的权利修建和加强防御的设备，包括飞机场的修建在内，而不容许任何人加以丝毫的干涉。我方代表继续指出对方所谓监督机构有权自由出入朝鲜一切部分的建议，其目的只是在于直接干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政，而对方保留武装部队在我方后方的岛屿上的要求更直接地违反了第二项议程关于军事分界线的协议，使敌对行为随时可以再度爆发。对方对于我方代表所提出的指责始终避免正面答复，但却坚持其不合理的建议和要求，我方代表再次建议代表团会议在我方对于第三项议程的充分而合理的五项原则建议的基础上迅速达成原则协议，并商定细节规定，以便早日进入俘虏问题的讨论。
