To uphold the law and earnestly implement the Marriage Law, the Shandong Provincial People's Government recently issued a circular, giving Zhu Shuren, Deputy President of the Feng County People's Court, who maintained the feudal marriage system, a dismissal punishment. The circular stated: Zhu Shuren, Deputy President of the Feng County People's Court, has often used "old age and illness" as an excuse since joining the revolution, neglected study, and harbors serious remnants of feudal ideology. In April of this year, when Zhu Shuren handled the case of Chen Shouduan from Chen Shuanglou in the ninth district of the county and his concubine, Ms. Hu, seeking to dissolve their relationship, he stood on the position of maintaining the feudal marriage system. He not only failed to provide due legal support for Ms. Hu's just act of resisting concubinage, oppression, and abuse in her desperate struggle for survival but falsely accused Ms. Hu of "eloping" and illegally detained her. He not only failed to properly encourage Chen Zhengsheng, who helped Ms. Hu escape from the fire pit, but abused his power and detained him for more than a month. He not only failed to legally protect Ms. Hu's due property but falsely accused Ms. Hu of "stealing" when she left, and recovered some of her belongings, ruling that they belonged to Chen Shouduan. He not only failed to properly handle the infant daughter, Lun Ni, born to Ms. Hu, in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law to protect the legitimate interests of children, but supported Chen Shouduan's feudal consciousness of "marrying a young wife to have children," and ruled that the child belonged to Chen Shouduan. He not only failed to help Ms. Hu and Yang Zuoying with their free marriage registration procedures but considered it "marrying a married woman without authorization" and forced the two to examine themselves at a mass meeting. This series of illegal acts actually maintained the feudal marriage system, deprived women of their right to strive for freedom of marriage, undermined the laws of the new democratic country, and damaged the new democratic country's marriage system. To ensure the correct implementation of the Marriage Law, support the masses' struggle against the feudal marriage system, and further educate all cadres, it is decided to give Zhu Shuren a dismissal punishment. The circular concluded: Judicial workers in all localities should learn from this lesson, strengthen their study, earnestly abide by the decrees of the Central People's Government, strive to improve their policy concepts and policy levels, thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants, and vigorously implement the new Marriage Law.

    山东省人民政府发出通令
    撤销丰县法院副院长朱树人的职务
    为严肃法纪，切实贯彻执行婚姻法，山东省人民政府顷发出通令，予维护封建婚姻制度的丰县人民法院副院长朱树人以撤职处分。该通令称：丰县人民法院副院长朱树人，参加革命后经常以“年老多病”为藉口，忽视学习，严重地存在着封建残余思想。今年四月间，朱树人处理该县第九区陈双楼陈守端与其妾胡氏脱离关系一案时，竟站在维护封建婚姻制度的立场，对胡氏反纳妾、反压迫、反虐待死里求生的正义行为，不仅未予以应有的法律支持，反诬胡氏为“私奔”，非法予以扣押。对帮助胡氏逃出火坑的陈正升，不仅未予以适当鼓励，反滥用职权，将其扣押月余之久。对胡氏应得财产，不仅未予合法保障，反诬胡氏出走时携带财物一节为“偷窃”，并将其随身携带的一些衣物，追回判归陈守端。对胡氏所生幼女伦妮，不仅未根据婚姻法保护子女合法利益的精神，妥善处理，反支持陈守端所谓“娶小纳妾，就是为了生儿养女”的封建意识，将小孩判归陈守端。对胡氏与杨作营的自由结婚，不仅未帮助其进行结婚登记手续，反认为是“擅娶有夫之妇”，迫令二人在群众大会上反省。这一系列的违法行为，实际上是维护了封建婚姻制度，剥夺了妇女争取婚姻自由的权利，破坏了新民主主义国家的法律，损害了新民主主义国家的婚姻制度。为保证婚姻法的正确贯彻执行，支持群众反封建婚姻制度的斗争，并进而教育全体干部，特决定予朱树人以撤职处分。通令最后指出：各地司法工作人员，应记取这一教训，加强学习，切实遵守中央人民政府法令，努力提高政策观念和政策水平，彻底肃清封建残余思想，大力地贯彻新婚姻法。（转载山东大众日报）
