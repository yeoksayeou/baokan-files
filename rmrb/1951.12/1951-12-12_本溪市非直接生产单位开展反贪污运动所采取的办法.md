Methods Adopted by Non-Direct Production Units in Benxi City to Carry Out the Anti-Corruption Campaign

A comprehensive report from our newspaper.

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in various non-direct production units in Benxi City, Northeast China (including various departments and sections of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, municipal government organs and municipal enterprises, and city-level Party and mass work departments), has gained considerable experience, which is worth referring to by other regions in carrying out this campaign.

Before the start of the campaign, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party determined that the issues to be resolved in all non-direct production units mainly included opposing corruption, degeneration, extravagance and waste, and bureaucratic work styles. It started with anti-corruption and gradually deepened the campaign. Various departments, according to their business nature and schedule, focused on the central tasks separately, and finally achieved the goal of solving all problems. The focus of anti-corruption was on the Finance Section of the Municipal Government, municipal enterprises, the Bureau of Commerce, cooperatives, the management offices, administrative offices, capital construction offices, and health offices of the Coal and Iron Company, as well as police stations and prisons of the Public Security Bureau. The planned steps were: first, study documents; second, confess and report; finally, clearly stipulate systems, rectify organizations, formulate savings plans, and handle cases. The method was to strengthen ideological education to strive for conscious confession on the one hand, and to mobilize mass reporting and exposure on the other.

On October 16, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of more than 40 leading cadres in charge of the anti-corruption campaign to study the Municipal Committee's plan and leadership methods. On October 17, a conference of 700 Party member cadres was convened, where a mobilization report was made on anti-corruption, anti-degeneration, and anti-bureaucracy, calling for the anti-corruption struggle to be launched first. On October 18, general cadre and staff meetings were held in six locations throughout the city, where mobilization reports were made separately. Large and small units held Party branch meetings and group meetings to discuss ways to ensure the victorious development of the campaign. Then, the stage of studying documents began (studying for about ten days). After studying the documents, everyone could first express their attitude, that is, whether they had any problems and whether they had the determination to confess, which could promote everyone's ideological struggle. Then, the stage of confession and reporting began. In the early stage of the campaign, mass reporting was not necessarily carried out publicly, because the masses were not yet sufficiently aware. People with corrupt behavior should organize the confessed facts into writing after confessing, sign and seal them, indicating that they are responsible for the confessed materials. This material serves as the basis for the final review by the higher authorities. This can prompt the confessing person to confess better.

The experience of Benxi City proves that without the firm attitude of the leadership and the magnificent momentum of the masses acting, the campaign cannot be carried out smoothly, and all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy cannot be thoroughly exposed. The so-called firm attitude of the leadership is by no means simply expressing a determination, but to realistically organize forces and conduct leadership. Without this, the determination will become empty talk. In leading this campaign, the Benxi Municipal Committee not only expressed its determination, but also organized all leading cadres to participate in the leadership of this campaign. For example, from the first day of the campaign, all responsible cadres of the Party, administration, and trade union personally participated in the leadership work of one department each. During the typical breakthrough, they personally talked to people and participated in group meetings. In addition, inspection teams were organized, and a system was stipulated for each department to report once a day, and all organs and the Coal and Iron Company in the city to report once every two days. This ensures that the established determination is guaranteed by organizational forces. As for the magnificent momentum of the masses, it is necessary to rely on repeated ideological education of the masses to improve their political consciousness, so that they can actively defend national interests with utmost sincerity and fearlessly examine themselves and expose all corrupt and wasteful behaviors of others. The experience of Benxi City proves that without the masses rising up, it is impossible to defeat the resistance of corrupt elements; conversely, once the masses rise up, any resistance will immediately become ineffective. For example, some corrupt elements put a kitchen knife under the bedding before the masses acted, saying that whoever reports them would be killed. But after the masses rose up, exposed their corrupt facts, and confiscated their kitchen knife, they had no ability at all, and only honestly confessed their corrupt facts. The reason why corrupt elements are unwilling to confess is mainly because they are afraid of losing face, returning stolen goods, and being punished. The general public initially did not dare to report, mainly because they were afraid of being held responsible if they made mistakes, offending people, and suffering revenge in the future. Therefore, the main responsibility of the leaders in the campaign is to use all means to accelerate the process of mass awareness and quickly mobilize the masses. The methods are: repeatedly conducting education, giving the masses the guarantee of not being retaliated against, strictly restricting all illegal activities of corrupt elements, and providing the masses with various conveniences for exposing corrupt behavior.

In order to evade guilt, corrupt elements have exhausted all kinds of methods to cover up their bad deeds. When they first heard the news of the anti-corruption campaign, they said, "We are mainly bureaucratic," "We don't have any problems," trying to shift the target of the masses. They tried to change slips, burn account books, fabricate reasons, and deceive the public. After in-depth study, the masses began to move, and corrupt elements were afraid that the struggle would unfold, so they discussed nouns in empty words, and even tried to suppress democracy and prevent the masses from speaking. Some even formed groups to secretly act. When they were forced to, they said a little lightly, pretending to have "completely confessed." Or, after confessing for only two days, they said, "Is it almost done!" Or, after saying a little, they immediately pretended to be activists, aggressively exposing others for taking a small knife from the public. Even more, some created some absurd corruption "theories," saying that "people have selfish desires, and selfish desires want to be rich, and to be rich, they must be corrupt"; "people are private animals, and corruption is human nature"; "revolution is for a better life, and corruption is also for a better life." Timely leading the masses to criticize this wrong attitude and "theory" is an important task to ensure the smooth development of the campaign. But only this aspect of work is not enough, the most important thing is to educate them from the front, so that they can truly recognize their mistakes and confess automatically. Otherwise, relying only on mass reporting and higher-level investigations cannot ideologically save those who can be saved. Benxi City's experience in this regard is: 1. Leading comrades should hold small meetings, give small lessons, or conduct individual talks with corrupt elements more often during a certain period to enlighten their political consciousness. Don't just say to them, "Confess! The organization will reduce your punishment if you confess!" Because we have a responsibility to ideologically save those who can be saved. 2. Organize the masses to educate them, especially organize awakened corrupt people to educate unawakened corrupt people. This method is more effective. 3. For those who have confessed, the masses should be educated not to blame them too harshly, so that they cannot hold their heads up everywhere; but should welcome their confession and awakening. 4. Those who are really stubborn must be strictly dealt with, otherwise they will not be able to defeat the evil spirits and get the campaign going. It should be noted here that, except for issues that will hinder the development of the campaign if not dealt with immediately, general issues should not be dealt with immediately, otherwise it will affect the in-depth development of the campaign.

Benxi City's experience also proves that the three contents of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign cannot be mechanically separated, nor can they be brought out all at once regardless of the importance. In general, no matter what department it is, it should start with anti-corruption first, and then gradually deepen and expand the campaign, so that all problems can be solved. Here, three issues need to be explained:

1. Why should general departments start with anti-corruption? In the past, some people thought that technical departments, Party and mass organizations, and general administrative management departments did not have much problem, and only financial departments had problems. This is not right. The facts in Benxi City prove that corrupt elements are everywhere, and even people who prescribe prescriptions in hospitals can be corrupt. Moreover, some corrupt elements are precisely using the unrealistic statement mentioned above, emphasizing "We don't have much corruption, we should quickly oppose bureaucracy," in an attempt to fool everyone. Some comrades in the administrative office of Benxi Coal and Iron Company said "there is nothing," but as soon as the campaign started, the corruption figures of just one person exposed greatly exceeded the prior estimate of all corruption in the administrative office. Since corrupt behavior is the result of the invasion of landlord and bourgeois ideology, it is entirely necessary to draw a clear line between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology through the anti-corruption campaign, and lay the ideological foundation for carrying out the anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy campaign. The facts of many units in Benxi City prove that the anti-corruption campaign is carried out thoroughly, and the struggle against waste and bureaucracy is carried out well. For example, after the anti-corruption campaign in the production department of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, many technical personnel automatically examined their bureaucracy, and asked the higher authorities to give them more work, and automatically studied how to go to the factories to carry out work.

The second question is that all departments start with anti-corruption, but this does not mean that they start at the same time regardless of the importance, end at the same time, and then turn to a unified center at the same time. For example, technical departments should not be the same as financial departments. Financial departments can use a longer time to carry out the anti-corruption campaign, while technical departments should quickly turn to the anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy campaign after clarifying the general corruption issues.

The third question is that anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy cannot be strictly separated. Because after the masses are mobilized, they often want to raise all the problems to be solved. The first center of Benxi City in this campaign was anti-corruption, but many problems raised by the masses exceeded the limits of anti-corruption. For example, someone came to work late, and the masses said, "Corruption and waste are harmful to national interests, isn't it harmful to national interests to work carelessly?" When the masses exposed someone's corrupt behavior, they often said, "He is not only corrupt, but also bureaucratic!" The leadership should not prevent the masses from doing this, nor should they let it go, but should timely guide the masses' progressive demands to the current central issues under discussion.

Should the anti-corruption campaign be carried out among the workers? The leading organs of Benxi City considered this issue for a long time, and only recently came to the conclusion: it should. The workers of the capital construction office of Benxi Coal and Iron Company saw that the cadres were doing a good job in anti-corruption, and some workers raised the issue:

"After the cadres fight corruption, they will work hard, and we should also clean up." So they held a confession meeting during the study time, and one by one came forward to confess the facts of private use of public property. In the end, everyone said, "It's too troublesome to confess one by one, let's raise our hands to see who still wants to confess!" As a result, more than one hundred workers raised their hands except for two who just came. This illustrates two things: 1. It shows that we have not done a good job in educating the workers to love national property in the past, so the phenomenon of workers using public property casually is very serious. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out this campaign among the workers. 2. It shows that this campaign can be carried out among the workers. According to this situation, the leading organs of Benxi City recently launched this campaign in refractory material factories, iron factories, and other places one after another, and achieved great results. The workers reviewed very simply and happily, and after the review, they made an agreement with each other: "We will never do that ugly thing again!" However, it should be noted when carrying out this campaign among the workers that the time should not be too long, generally four or five days to six or seven days is appropriate. After this, it should quickly turn to improving technology, improving quality and output, and opposing waste. Because the workers' problems are generally simpler, and their main task is to increase production.

    本溪市非直接生产单位开展反贪污运动所采取的办法
    本报综合稿
    东北区本溪市各个非直接生产单位（包括本溪煤铁公司各处及各厂矿科股，市政机关及市政企业单位，市级的党和群众工作部门）的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，获得不少经验，值得各地在开展这一运动时参考。
    中共本溪市委在运动开始前，就确定了在全部非直接生产单位中解决的问题，主要是反对贪污现象、蜕化现象、铺张浪费和官僚主义作风。先从反贪污开始，逐步深入。各部门按照业务性质，进度先后，分别抓住中心进行，最后达到解决全部问题。反贪污的重点是市府财务科、市政企业单位、商业局、合作社、煤铁公司的经理处、行政处、基本建设处和卫生处，公安局的派出所和监狱。预定的步骤是：首先学习文件，其次进行坦白和检举，最后明确地规定制度，整顿机构，制订节约计划，处理案件。方法是一方面加强思想教育，争取自觉坦白；另方面发动群众性的检举、揭发。
    十月十六日，中共本溪市委召集领导反贪污运动的主要负责干部四十多人开会，研究了市委的计划和领导方法。十月十七日召集了七百人的党员干部大会，作了反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义的动员报告，号召首先开展反贪污斗争。十月十八日，全市分六处召开一般干部和工作人员大会，又分别作了动员报告。大小单位都召开了党的支部会和小组会，讨论了保证胜利开展这一运动的办法。然后进入学习文件的阶段（学习十天左右）。学习文件之后可以先让各个人表示态度，即自己有没有问题，有没有坦白的决心，这样可以促进大家的思想斗争。然后进入坦白和检举阶段。运动初期，群众的检举不一定公开进行，因为群众的觉悟还不够高。有贪污行为的人，在坦白之后，应将坦白事实整理成文，签名、盖章，表示自己对坦白材料负责。这份材料作为上级最后审查的根据。这样作可以促使坦白的人坦白得更好。
    本溪市的经验证明：没有领导方面的坚定的态度和群众行动起来的宏伟气势，运动便不能顺利开展，一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，便不可能得到彻底的揭发。所谓领导上的坚定态度，决不是简单地表示一下决心，而是要踏踏实实地组织力量，进行领导。没有这一条，决心就会变成空喊。本溪市委在领导这一运动中，不但表示了决心，而且组织了所有领导干部，参加这一运动的领导。如从运动的第一天开始，党、行政、工会的所有负责干部，便每人亲自参加了一个部门的领导工作。在典型突破的时候，他们亲自找人谈话，参加小组会议。另外并组织了检查小组，规定各部门每天汇报一次、全市各机关及煤铁公司两天汇报一次的制度。这样便使得既定的决心，获得组织力量的保证。至于群众的宏伟气势，必须依靠对群众进行反复的思想教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们出于至诚地积极保卫国家利益，无畏地检查自己和揭发别人的一切贪污浪费行为。本溪市的经验证明：群众不起来，便不可能击破贪污分子的抗拒，反之，群众一起来，则任何抗拒都立即失效。譬如有的贪污分子在群众没有行动起来以前，在铺底下放了菜刀，说是谁检举他就杀谁。但在群众起来以后，揭发了他的贪污事实，没收了他的菜刀，他什么本领也没有了，只有老老实实地坦白了贪污事实。贪污分子之所以不愿意坦白，主要是怕丢人，怕倒赃，怕受处分。一般群众最初不敢检举，主要是怕弄错了要负责，怕得罪人，怕将来遭受报复。因此，领导者在运动中的主要责任就是用一切办法加速群众的觉悟过程，迅速把群众发动起来。办法是：反复地进行教育，给群众以不受报复的保证；严格限制贪污分子的一切非法活动，给群众以各种揭发贪污行为的便利。
    贪污分子为了逃避罪责，曾用尽各种方法来掩盖自己的劣迹。他们在刚刚听到反贪污的风声时就说：“我们主要是官僚主义”，“我们没有什么问题”。企图以此转移群众的目标。他们设法改条子，烧账本，捏造理由，蒙蔽众人眼目。经过深入学习，群众开始动起来了，贪污分子怕斗争展开，就空话连篇地讨论名词，还企图压制民主，不叫群众讲话。有的甚至结成集团暗中活动。迫不得已时，他们就避重就轻地说一点，假装已经“彻底坦白”。或是刚刚开始坦白了两天，他们就说：“差不多了吧！”或说出一点之后，马上装成积极分子，气势汹汹地揭发别人曾拿了公家的一把小刀之类的事情。更有的制造一些荒谬的贪污“理论”，说什么“人有私欲，私欲要富，要富必贪污”；“人就是私有动物，贪污就是人性”；“革命是为了生活好，贪污也是为了生活好”。及时地领导群众批判这种错误的态度和“理论”，是保证运动顺利开展的重要工作。但仅有这一方面的工作还不够，最主要的还是从正面教育他们，使他们真正认识自己的错误，自动地坦白。否则，只靠群众的检举，上级的调查，还不能从思想上挽救那些可以挽救的人。本溪市在这一方面的经验是：一、领导同志在一定时期多给贪污分子开小会，上小课，或进行个别谈话，启发他们的政治觉悟。不要只向他们说：“坦白吧！坦白了组织上会减轻对你的处分！”因为我们有责任从思想上挽救那些可以挽救的人。二、组织群众来教育他们，特别是组织觉悟了的贪污者去教育还没有觉悟的贪污者，用这种方式收效更大。三、对坦白了的人，应当教育群众不要过苛地责备他们，使他们处处抬不起头来；而应当欢迎他们的坦白和觉悟。四、对那些实在顽固的人，则必须进行严格处理，否则就不能打倒邪气，使运动开展起来。这里要注意的是：除了不立即处理即会妨害运动开展的问题以外，一般的问题不要立即处理，否则会影响运动的深入开展。
    本溪市的经验还证明：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的三个内容不能机械地分开，也不能不分轻重地一齐端出来。在一般情况下，不管任何部门都应当先从反贪污开始，然后逐步深入、扩大，以便使全部问题得到解决。这里要说明三个问题：
    一、为什么一般部门都要从反贪污开始？过去有人认为：技术部门、党和群众团体及一般行政管理部门没有多大问题，只有财务部门才有问题。这是不对的。本溪市的事实证明：贪污分子是无孔不入的，连医院开药方的人都能贪污。而且有些贪污分子，正是利用上述那种不切实际的说法，强调“我们在贪污方面没啥，应当快反官僚主义”，以图蒙混大家。本溪煤铁公司行政处的某些同志说“没有啥”，但是运动刚一起来，只揭发了一个人的贪污数字，就大大超过了事先对行政处全部贪污的估计数字。由于贪污行为是地主、资产阶级思想侵袭我们的结果，因而通过反贪污运动，把资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想之间划一条鲜明的界限，打下开展反浪费、反官僚主义运动的思想基础，是完全必要的。本溪市许多单位的事实证明，那里的反贪污运动进行得彻底，那里的反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争就进行得好。比如本溪煤铁公司生产处在反贪污运动以后，许多技术人员便自动检查自己的官僚主义，并要求上级多给工作，自动研究怎样下厂进行工作。
    第二个问题，所有部门都从反贪污开始，但这并不是说不分轻重主次地同时开始，同时结束，同时再转向统一的中心。比如技术部门就不应和财务部门一样。财务部门可以用较长的时间来进行反贪污运动，而技术部门在把一般贪污问题弄清以后，就应迅速转入反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
    第三个问题，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义不可能严格地分开进行。因为群众动起来以后，往往什么问题都想提出来解决。本溪市在这一运动中第一个中心是反贪污，但群众提出来的许多问题都超出了反贪污的界限。比如有人上班来晚了，群众就说：“贪污、浪费是损害国家利益，工作马马虎虎不是损害国家利益吗？”群众在揭发某人贪污行为的时候，也往往说：“他不但贪污，还有官僚主义！”群众这样作，领导方面不应阻止，也不应任其自流，而应当及时地把群众这种进步要求导向当前讨论的中心问题。
    在工人群众中应不应当开展反贪污运动呢？这一问题，本溪市的领导机关曾考虑了很久，直到最近才得出结论：应当。本溪煤铁公司基本建设处的工人看到干部反贪污做得很好，有的工人就提出来：
    “干部反贪污以后就好好工作了，咱们也应该清理清理。”于是就在学习时间开了个坦白会，一个个起来坦白私用公物的事实。最后大家都说：“一个个坦白太麻烦了，现在先举手看看谁还想坦白吧！”结果一百多个工人除了两个刚来的以外，都举了手。这说明了两件事：一、说明我们过去对工人没有很好地进行爱护国家财产的教育，因而工人随便动用公物的现象很严重。所以，在工人中间开展这一运动是必要的。二、说明这一运动在工人中间可以开展起来。本溪市领导机关根据这一情况，最近先后在耐火材料厂、铁厂等处发动了这一运动，收效都很大。工人检讨得很干脆，很痛快，并在检讨以后互相定约：“今后再不干那丑事了！”但在工人中开展这一运动时应当注意，不要时间太长，一般的以四、五天至六、七天为适宜。在这以后，应迅速转向改进技术，提高质量、产量和反对浪费方面去。因为工人的问题一般都比较简单，而他们的任务主要是增加生产。
