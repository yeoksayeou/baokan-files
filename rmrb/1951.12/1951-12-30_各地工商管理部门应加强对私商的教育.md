    Local Industrial and Commercial Administrative Departments Should Strengthen Education for Private Merchants
    To the Editor: In handling the embezzlement case of truck driver Zhang Yunlong recently, our department discovered that some unscrupulous private merchants were engaging in despicable bribery of staff members of state organs. In November of last year, when Zhang Yunlong went to the Juhe Automobile Repair Factory on Xisi Avenue in Beijing to repair a truck, the repair cost was only 800,000 yuan, but the manager of this factory, a Mr. Wang, bribed him with 200,000 yuan. In July 1950, this driver went to the Beijing Juhe Automobile Repair Factory again, and Mr. Wang further courted him, inviting him to dinner and bribing him again with 1,000,000 yuan. Mr. Wang also said to Zhang Yunlong:
    "Take it back and distribute it to the fellows (referring to the personnel who went with Zhang to repair the car). Contact me more often if there is work in the future."
    In June of last year, Zhang Yunlong repaired a truck at the Wenshan Automobile Repair Factory on Xiguan Avenue in Baoding. The manager of this factory, Guo Wenshan, even encouraged Zhang Yunlong to jointly steal 25 jin of gasoline stored in the jeep, and afterwards divided 180,000 yuan to Zhang. We suggest that the local industrial and commercial administrative departments strengthen the patriotic education of private merchants, mobilize the masses to report unscrupulous merchants at any time, and eliminate this illegal behavior of using despicable means to win over staff members of state organs and steal state property.

    各地工商管理部门应加强对私商的教育
    编辑同志：我部最近处理汽车司机张云龙的贪污案件时，发现有些不法私商，卑鄙地向国家机关工作人员行使贿赂。去年十一月间，张云龙去北京西四大街聚合汽车修理厂修理汽车时，修理费仅八十万元，而这个厂的经理王某就贿赂了他二十万元。一九五○年七月，这个司机又去北京聚合汽车修理厂修理汽车，王某更进一步地拉拢他，请他吃饭，并再一次贿赂他一百万元。王某还向张云龙说：
    “回去给伙计们分，（指随张去修车的人员）今后有活多联系。”
    去年六月，张云龙在保定西关大街文山汽车修理厂修理汽车，这个厂的经理郭文山竟怂恿张云龙共同窃取吉普车内蓄存的二十五斤汽油，事后分给张十八万元。我们建议各地工商行政管理部门，加强对私商的爱国主义教育，并发动群众，随时检举奸商，消灭这种用卑鄙手段拉拢国家机关工作人员，盗窃国家财产的违法行为。
