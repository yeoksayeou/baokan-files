The achievements of the Second Session of the World Peace Council
Guo Moruo

(I)
The Second Session of the World Peace Council opened in Vienna on November 1st. With the participation of 239 council members and special representatives from 58 countries, the meeting lasted for six days, resulting in ten important resolutions, and concluded at 2:00 AM on the 7th.

The session discussed two reports: one was political, "On the Possibility and Methods of Concluding a Peace Pact"; the other was cultural, "On Developing Cultural Exchange Between Peoples of Various Countries."

The task of the meeting focused on the political side; therefore, out of the ten resolutions, eight were political and two were cultural.

(II)
The most important of the political resolutions was the resolution on disarmament. The formulation of this resolution can be said to be the central task of this session.

The imperialist aggressive bloc has recently become increasingly frantic in clamoring for and engaging in arms expansion. In particular, U.S. imperialism is using the Korean War to deliberately create a tense situation and pass huge military budgets. From July of this year to the end of June next year, the military expenditure for this new fiscal year is 81.8 billion U.S. dollars, plus the so-called "special expenditure" for the Korean issue will exceed 90 billion U.S. dollars.

The aggressive bloc is engaging in war preparations so frantically, naturally aiming to satisfy the greedy desires of a few big capitalists, but they also have a set of excuses to deceive the people. They slander our China as an "aggressor" in Korea, and even more frequently slander the Soviet Union as an aggressive country, whose military power is particularly strong, threatening their so-called "free world." Therefore, they must expand their armaments to prevent "aggression," or at least maintain an armed peace of equilibrium through an arms race. This is a consistent deceptive tactic of "the thief crying 'stop thief.'" Relying on this deceptive tactic, they reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong on a large scale, deceiving a portion of simple people, thus giving the warmongers capital to increase their tense atmosphere. Therefore, trying our best to expose the deception of the warmongers, reducing their excuses for creating tension, and smashing their absurd theories, inevitably becomes the central task of this session. To accomplish this task, the Council put forward a proposal for general disarmament, requesting the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France, to conclude a disarmament pact. The five major powers must agree to gradually and supervisedly reduce all kinds of armaments, reducing all open and hidden armaments by one-third to one-half by the end of 1952, and abolish atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. The proportions and timetables for disarmament among countries should be determined according to the existing levels of armaments, troops, and military production, population size, length of borders, and transportation systems of the countries concerned. To achieve the goals of such disarmament and the abolition of atomic weapons, a comprehensive investigation and strict supervision must be carried out.

This resolution is very fair and reasonable and represents a great step forward compared with the resolution of the Warsaw Conference last year. The Warsaw Conference called for "gradual, simultaneous, and proportional disarmament," while now the timetable and proportions are not required to be uniform, but should vary according to the actual situation of each country. This can reduce the opponents' excuses, and if it is to be implemented, it can reasonably formulate specific implementation plans.

(III)
Parallel to the disarmament issue is the resolution to strengthen the signature campaign to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. This resolution is only a supplement to the Berlin resolution. The First Session of the World Peace Council, held in Berlin in February of this year, proposed a signature campaign to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. Since the launch of this movement worldwide, by the time this session opened, more than 562 million signatures had been collected. However, since we China accounted for more than 344 million, and the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries accounted for about 200 million, it is necessary to continue to promote it in other countries.

The basic intention of the demands for disarmament and the conclusion of a peace pact is to expose the deceptive propaganda of the warmongers and reduce their excuses for creating tension. The warmongers slander our China and the Soviet Union as "aggressive forces" and believe that the Soviet Union's military power is particularly strong, threatening them. Well, today our Chinese and Soviet people both support the conclusion of a peace pact, and the Soviet Union is an active advocate of disarmament, so what will the governments of your U.S., Britain, and France do? If you agree, you must abandon your aggressive policies; if you disagree, then the excuse of the aggressive bloc will be exposed. Their excuse is nothing more than deceptive propaganda that reverses black and white. Exposing the deception of the aggressive bloc is to expose the essence of the aggressive bloc. In this way, the broad masses of the people can be rescued from the enemy's deceptive propaganda, gradually defeat the enemy's aggressive policies, eliminate the war crisis, and make it possible for the peace pact to be finally concluded. This positive effect cannot be underestimated, and therefore, the struggle to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact must indeed be further strengthened worldwide.

(IV)
Among the eight political resolutions, in addition to the disarmament resolution and the resolution to strengthen the peace pact movement, five are resolutions on regional issues, namely, the issues of Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and Vietnam, the Middle East, Near East and North Africa, and Germany. These five resolutions on regional issues are based on two principles: national self-determination and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Under these two principles, the Council advocates that all international disputes be resolved through peaceful negotiations.

The eighth political resolution is the "Letter to the United Nations and the People of the World." This is a summary of the seven political resolutions, and it can also be said to be a preface. However, there are also issues mentioned in this letter that are not mentioned in the seven resolutions, and appropriate supplements are made. For example, among the five issues requiring the United Nations to "pay special attention," the first one, "the Government of the People's Republic of China must be allowed to join the United Nations," is not included in the various resolutions, but is specifically mentioned.

For example, in the third item, "The right of the people of Asian countries to independence and territorial integrity without foreign interference should be guaranteed," the words "territorial integrity" are also not included in the various resolutions. The intention of adding these words is to include the Taiwan issue, but needless to say, issues such as the Ogasawara Islands of Japan are also included.

After these resolutions were passed at the conference, the Executive Bureau authorized Chairman Joliot-Curie to take them back to Paris and negotiate with the Sixth General Assembly of the United Nations, which was meeting in Paris on the 7th, and organize a delegation nearby to request a meeting with the United Nations. If the United Nations grants a meeting, it will of course be a victory for the peace movement. If the United Nations still refuses to grant a meeting, it will once again expose that the United Nations is merely a tool manipulated by the aggressive bloc to cover up aggression.

(V)
There are two resolutions on cultural exchange.

The first is the "Resolution on the Organization of Cultural Exchange," which has already been published in full domestically. The focus of this resolution is to require the Cultural Exchange Committee established under the Executive Bureau to pay attention to various specific designs to promote this work, and to suggest that the national peace associations also establish similar organizations to engage in the design and promotion of specific plans.

The second is the "Resolution on Setting Up Peace Holidays and Great Cultural Anniversary Celebrations for 1952." On the one hand, it wants to use the summer vacation next year to invite students, scholars, and writers from other countries to spend their holidays in their own country. On the other hand, it wants to use the anniversary of some great figures in cultural history (such as the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great French novelist Hugo next year, the 500th anniversary of the birth of the great painter Da Vinci during the Italian Renaissance, the 100th anniversary of the death of the great Russian novelist Gogol, etc.) to invite countries to launch commemorative meetings to enhance the importance of culture and the friendship between the people of different countries.

(VI)
What kind of evaluation should we give to these resolutions? I think this issue should be examined from three aspects.

First, the current international situation. The confrontation between the peace camp and the aggressive camp in the international arena is more acute at present than it was at the Berlin Conference in February. On the one hand, the strength of the peace camp has become stronger. Due to the Soviet government's firm and unswerving peace policy and the heroic achievements of the Soviet people in peaceful construction, the post-war five-year plan has been overfulfilled, making the Soviet Union an even stronger peace fortress. Moreover, with the strong support of the Soviet Union, the Eastern European new democratic countries and our People's Republic of China have also made brilliant achievements in peaceful construction.

Also, due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, especially the common great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in the Korean War over the past year, the oppressed people all over the world have been encouraged. The flames of national liberation and resistance to imperialism have spread throughout the Far East, and even from the Far East to the Middle East, the Near East, and even North Africa. The people of colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries all over the world have almost universally risen up to fight for their national independence and freedom, which is also to fight for lasting world peace.

But on the other hand, the crisis of war is also continuing to intensify. First of all, U.S. imperialism, in order to satisfy the desires of the eight major financial groups, adheres to its aggressive policy and war policy, and intends to create a "decade of tension." Military spending for 1951-52 exceeded 90 billion U.S. dollars. In Europe, although Eisenhower's plan to organize a "European Army" has suffered repeated setbacks, the heinous plan to destroy Germany's unity and rearm West Germany is still being accelerated. In the East, due to the conclusion of the illegal Treaty of Peace with Japan in San Francisco on September 8 and the so-called "U.S.-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty," U.S. imperialism has removed all disguises and is further arming Japan, preparing to expand its aggression against Asia. British and French imperialism also stand with U.S. imperialism in terms of war policy.

Such a tense confrontation is the current international situation. What kind of goals should our peace movement pursue under such a situation? Our goal is to strike at the warmongers' plans, deprive them of all excuses for preparing for war, expand the peace movement, encourage the strength of the peace camp, and encourage the national liberation movement. For example, the disarmament resolution, the resolution to strengthen the peace pact movement, and even the resolution on the Korean issue, are mainly aimed at expanding the peace struggle and depriving the warmongers of any excuses for creating tension. The other resolutions on regional issues adhere to the principles of national self-determination and the withdrawal of foreign troops, which are also important contributions to the peace movement and the national liberation struggle.

(VII)
Second, we should look at the issue from the nature of the peace movement.

The peace movement is a kind of international united front work, and its task is to unite all peace-loving forces and isolate the warmongers.

Marshal Stalin, in his conversation with a reporter from Pravda on February 17 of this year, that is, the fourth day before the Berlin Conference, made a very clear statement on the essence of the peace movement:

"If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persist in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the warmongers are able to entrap the masses of the people with a web of lies, deceive the masses of the people, and drag the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable.

"That is why the broad movement to maintain peace, as a tool to expose the criminal conspiracies of the warmongers, is now of the utmost importance."

The purpose of the peace movement is to prevent "another world war," its policy is to "expose the criminal conspiracies of the warmongers," and its object is the masses of the people of all countries. Its movement must be as broad as possible. Since the object is the masses of the people, and the masses of the people under the enemy's deceptive forces, to win over the broad masses of the people from the enemy's "web of lies," it is necessary to adopt a persuasive attitude as much as possible in order to achieve results.

If we can win over the broad masses of the people from the enemy's deceptive forces, we will of course strengthen the peace camp and isolate the opposing camp. Constantly and skillfully doing this in this direction, making the contrast between the strengths of the two camps more and more disparate, we are likely to achieve our goal—eliminating another world war. Even if this war cannot be eliminated in the end, at least the outbreak of the war can be delayed and the suffering can be shortened.

Looking at the issue from this perspective, this session is indeed a successful one. The various resolution documents are very principled, very persuasive, and in terms of textual expression, it seems that the enemy has no way to criticize them. Not only are the documents like this, but many important speeches at the conference revealed this spirit, which is worthy of attention.

(VIII)
Third, we should look at the issue from the period of this session.

This session was convened after the illegal San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan and before the United Nations Paris Conference. Therefore, the conference mobilized world public opinion to give a comprehensive denial to the illegal San Francisco conference, and held a demonstration for the United Nations Paris Conference. The conference expressed full support for the just positions of China and the Soviet Union. From this perspective, this session was a great success.

(IX)
The conference was a success. This goes without saying that it is the result of the joint efforts of all the staff of the Executive Bureau, the result of the joint efforts of all the representatives present, and the result of the joint efforts of the people of all countries around the world.

We should thank the Austrian people, the working class of Vienna, the vanguard of the working class, and the friends of the Austrian Committee for the Defense of Peace for their help. In particular, it must be considered that Vienna is a city jointly managed by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and the Austrian government is a government in which the Social Democratic Party and the Catholic Party exercise power. This pro-British and American government is hostile to the peace movement. In fact, it did its best to obstruct this session. Many representatives could not attend because they could not obtain visas. Mr. Nenni, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Council, was also obstructed after arriving at the border, and only arrived at the venue on the evening of the 2nd. Under such a regime, the support of Austrian friends for the conference was even more difficult. Taking the means of transportation as an example, during the conference, many friends drove their own cars and served as drivers to serve the representatives attending the conference. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Austrian Committee for the Defense of Peace organized a demonstration of 100,000 people, which greatly enhanced the momentum of the World Peace Council. The strictness of the organization, the grandeur of the scale, and what was seen in the people's democratic countries were almost comparable.

We should especially thank the strong peace fortress, the Soviet Union, for its firm and unswerving consistent peace policy. It is this policy that has encouraged the people all over the world and increased the belief in victory in the peace camp. The outstanding efforts of the Soviet representatives were also obvious to all. Their tireless struggle was an important factor in enabling the conference to achieve success.

(X)
The conference closed victoriously. The various resolutions have been widely supported worldwide. Our Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression also issued a statement on November 16: "Believes that the resolutions of this session of the World Peace Council and the various propositions in the Letter to the United Nations and the People of the World are fully in line with the peace aspirations of the Chinese people, and therefore decides to accept them all and firmly support them."

The Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression further called on "all people's organizations and the people of the whole country to unite as one, and to unite as one with the people of all countries in the world, to strive to realize the various decisions of this session of the World Peace Council, and first of all to strive to achieve a peaceful and just resolution of the Korean issue, the Japanese issue, and other important issues in the Far East, the Middle East, and North Africa. In order to achieve this goal, the people of the whole country must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, increase production, practice strict economy, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and carry out the struggle to resist America and aid Korea until a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue is achieved."

This statement is correct and resounding. Standing at the forefront of defending peace, we Chinese people, in addition to fully supporting the general action program for defending world peace decided by the World Peace Council, must also resolutely implement our special action program for defending world peace.

Our movement to resist America and aid Korea is in fact the best way for us to defend world peace. Not only is the movement to resist America and aid Korea inseparable from the cause of defending peace, but also the construction cause of our great motherland is inseparable from the cause of defending peace. If we build our great motherland into an indestructible peace fortress like the Soviet Union, then will not the cause of defending world peace have a more solid guarantee? Work hard, comrades! Let us fight to eliminate the danger of another world war and strive for lasting world peace!

Long live the World Peace and Democracy Camp!
Long live the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

    世界和平理事会第二届会议的成就
    郭沫若
    （一）
    世界和平理事会第二届会议是十一月一日在维也纳开幕的。在五十八个国家，二三九位理事和特邀代表的参加之下，经过了六天的会议，得到了十项重要的决议，于七日晨二时闭幕了。
    本届会议讨论了两个报告：一个是政治性的“关于缔结和平公约的可能性与办法”；另一个是文化性的“关于发展各国人民之间的文化交流”。
    会议的任务是侧重在政治性一边的，因此十项决议中，政治性的是八项，文化性的是两项。
    （二）
    政治性的决议中最重要的是关于裁减军备的决议，这项决议的制定可以说是本届会议的中心任务。
    帝国主义侵略阵营，近来是愈见疯狂地在叫嚣着并从事着扩充军备。特别是美帝国主义利用朝鲜战争，故意造成紧张局势，通过了庞大的军事预算。从本年七月起至明年六月底止，这一新年度的军事费用为八一八亿美元，再加上关于朝鲜问题的所谓“特别支出”将超过九百亿美元。
    侵略阵营这样疯狂地从事战争准备，目的自然在满足少数大资本家们的贪婪欲望，但它们也有一套欺骗人民的藉口。它们诬蔑我们中国是在朝鲜的“侵略者”，更经常诬蔑苏联是具有侵略性的国家，苏联的军事力量特别强大，使它们的所谓“自由世界”受着威胁。因此，它们必须扩充军备，防止“侵略”，至少要以军事竞赛来保持势均力敌的武装和平。这就是“贼喊捉贼”的一贯的欺骗技俩。靠着这种欺骗技俩，大规模地颠倒黑白、淆乱是非，使一部分单纯的人们受了蒙蔽，因此战争贩子们也就有了资本来增加它们的紧张的气焰了。因此，尽力揭露战争贩子们的欺骗，减少它们制造紧张局势的藉口，击破它们的荒谬理论，也就不能不成为本届会议的中心任务。为了达成这项任务，理事会提出了普遍裁军的建议，要求中、苏、英、美、法五大国缔结裁军公约。五大国必须同意逐渐而有监督地裁减各种军备，到一九五二年底要把公开的和掩蔽的一切军备裁减三分之一至二分之一，并废除原子弹及其它大量杀人的武器。各国之间的裁减军备的比例数和时间表要依照有关各国的军备、军队和军需生产的现有水平、人口多寡、国境线长短和交通系统的情况而决定。为了实现这样裁减军备和废止原子武器的目的，必须进行全面的调查和严密的监督。
    这一决议是很公平而合理的，比去年华沙大会时的决议是大大地推进了一步。华沙大会时所号召的是“逐渐的同时的同比例的裁军”，现在是在时间表和比例数上并不求其划一，要依各国的实际情况而有所不同。这就可以减少敌对者的推诿，如果要见诸实施，也就可以合情合理地拟出具体的实施方案来了。
    （三）
    和裁军问题平行的是加强要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动的决议。这个决议只是柏林决议的增补。本年二月在柏林召开的世界和平理事会第一届会议提出了要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动。这个运动在全世界范围内发动以来，到本届会议开幕时，已经征集到五亿六千二百万人以上的签名。但因为在这里面我们中国就占了三亿四千四百多万，苏联和其它新民主主义国家占两亿左右，在其他国家就还需要继续推进。
    裁减军备和缔结和平公约的要求，基本上的用意就是在揭破战争贩子们的欺骗宣传而减少它们制造紧张局势的藉口。战争贩子们既诬蔑我们中苏两国为“侵略势力”，而且认为苏联的军事力量特别强大，使它们受着威胁，那吗好，今天我们中苏两国人民都赞成缔结和平公约了，而苏联更是裁减军备的积极主张者，那末你美英法的政府将怎样呢？同意吧，那就必须放弃侵略政策，不同意吧，那就戳穿了侵略集团的藉口，它们的藉口不外是颠倒黑白的欺骗宣传。戳穿侵略集团的欺骗便是暴露侵略集团的本质。这样就可以把广大的人民群众从敌人的欺骗宣传的天罗地网中救出，逐步击破敌人的侵略政策，消灭战争危机，而使和平公约有终于得到缔结的可能。这一积极的作用是不可低估的，因而要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名斗争，在全世界范围内，确实是有更进一步加强的必要。
    （四）
    八项政治性的决议中，除掉裁军决议与加强和平公约运动的决议之外，有五项是区域问题的决议，便是关于日本问题，朝鲜问题，东南亚和越南问题，中东近东北非问题，德国问题。这五项区域问题的决议是以两项原则为骨干的，便是民族自决与撤退外国军队。在这两个原则之下，理事会主张一切国际上的纠纷以和平谈判的方式来解决。
    第八项政治性的决议便是“告联合国与世界各国人民书”。这是七项政治性决议的总结，也可以说是一篇序言。但在这封信里面也有在七项决议中所没有提到的问题，而作了适当的补充的。例如在要求联合国“特别注意”的五项问题中，第一项里面所说的“必须允许中华人民共和国政府加入联合国”，便是各项决议中所没有，而特别提到的。
    又如第三项“亚洲各国人民不受外国的干涉而独立和领土完整的权利应得到保证”这一句话里面，“领土完整”这几个字也是各项决议中所没有的。加入了这几个字的用意是想包括着台湾问题，但如日本的小笠原群岛等问题不用说也是包括着的。
    这些决议在大会上通过之后，由执行局授权给约里奥—居里主席，由他带回到巴黎去，向七日在巴黎开会的联合国第六届大会交涉，可以就近组织代表团要求联合国接见。假如联合国接见了，当然是和平运动的一项胜利。假如联合国依然拒绝接见，那是又一次暴露了联合国只是侵略集团所操纵的掩饰侵略的工具而已。
    （五）
    文化交流的决议是两项。
    第一项是“关于文化交流的组织的决议”，这在国内已经全文发表了。这项决议的重点是在要求执行局下所成立的文化交流委员会注意各种具体的设计来推进这项工作，同时并建议各国和平分会也成立同样的组织，以从事具体计划的设计和推进。
    第二项是“关于一九五二年度设置和平休假及文化上的伟大周年纪念的决议”，一方面想利用明年的暑假互相邀请别国的学生们、学者们和作家们到自己的国土来度过休假，另一方面想利用文化史上一些伟大人物的周年纪念（如明年是法国大小说家雨果的诞生百五十周年，意大利文艺复兴期的大画家达文齐的诞生五百周年，俄国大小说家果戈里逝世百周年等），请各国发动纪念会以增进对于文化的重视和国与国之间的人民的情谊。
    （六）
    对于这些决议，我们应该给予怎样的评价呢？我觉得这个问题该从三方面来加以检讨。
    首先是当前的国际形势。国际上和平阵营和侵略阵营的对立在当前比起二月柏林会议时是更加尖锐化了。一方面是和平阵营的力量更加壮大了起来。由于苏联政府坚定不移的和平政策和苏联人民在和平建设中的英雄业绩，战后五年计划超额完成了，使苏联成为了更加坚强的和平堡垒。而且在苏联的大力支援之下，东欧新民主主义国家和我们中华人民共和国在和平建设方面也都有了辉煌的成就。
    又由于中国人民革命的胜利，尤其是一年来在朝鲜战争中中朝人民的共同的伟大胜利，鼓舞了全世界被压迫的人民，民族解放的烽火、反抗帝国主义的烽火，燃遍了远东，更由远东燃到中东近东，更燃到了北非。全世界殖民地、半殖民地和附属国的人民差不多全面地起来了，为本民族的独立自由而奋斗，也就是为世界持久和平的争取而奋斗。
    但在另一方面，战争的危机也是在继续加重。首先是美帝国主义，为了满足八大财阀集团的欲望，它坚持着它的侵略政策、战争政策，存心制造“十年的紧张局势”。一九五一—五二年度的军事费用超过了九百亿美元。在欧洲，艾森豪威尔组织“欧洲军”的计划虽然屡次遭受挫折，但破坏德国的统一、重新武装西德的罪恶计划仍在加紧进行着。在东方，则由于九月八日旧金山对日非法和约和所谓
    “美日双边安全条约”的缔结，美帝国主义已经揭去了一切的掩饰，更进一步武装日本，准备扩大对亚洲的侵略。英法帝国主义在战争政策方面也和美帝国主义站在一边。
    这样紧张的对立就是当前的国际形势。我们的和平运动在这样的形势之下应当追求怎样的目标呢？我们的目标就是要打击战争贩子的计划，剥夺他们一切准备战争的藉口，扩大和平运动，鼓励和平阵营的力量，鼓励民族解放的运动。例如裁军决议、加强和平公约运动的决议、乃至关于朝鲜问题的决议，主要的目的都是为了扩大和平斗争，剥夺战争贩子们制造紧张局势的任何藉口。其它各项区域问题的决议，坚持了民族自决与撤退外国军队的原则，这些也都是对于和平运动和民族解放斗争的重要贡献。
    （七）
    第二，我们当从和平运动的性质来看问题。
    和平运动是一种国际性的统一战线工作，它的任务是团结一切爱好和平的力量，孤立战争贩子。
    斯大林大元帅在本年二月十七日，也就是在柏林会议之前的第四日，对真理报记者所发表的谈话里面，有一段话很明白地说明了和平运动的本质：
    “如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末，战争就可能变得不可避免。
    “就是因为这个缘故，广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，现在具有最重大的意义。”
    和平运动的目的是要防止“另一次的世界大战”，它的方针是要“揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋”，它的对象是各国的人民群众。它的运动面要尽力求其广泛。对象既是人民群众，而且是在敌人欺骗势力之下的人民群众，要从敌人的“谎言的罗网”中把广大的人民群众争取过来，那就必须采取一种尽情尽理的说服态度，才能收到效果。
    我们如能从敌人的欺骗势力之下争取到广大的人民群众，当然也就加强了和平阵营而孤立了敌对阵营。不断地向着这个方向巧妙地做去，使两阵营的力量对比愈见悬殊，我们是有可能达到我们的目的——消灭另一次的世界战争。即使这一战争不能终归消灭，至少可以延迟战争的爆发而缩短痛苦。
    从这一个角度来看问题时，本届会议也确实是一项成功的会议。各项决议文件，原则性很强，说服力很大，在文字表现上，似乎使敌人也无从非难。不仅文件是这样，大会上好些重要的发言都表露了这种精神，这是值得重视的。
    （八）
    第三，我们当从本届会议的时期来看问题。
    本届会议的召开是在旧金山非法对日和会之后、联合国巴黎大会之前。因此，会议动员了世界舆论对于旧金山非法和会给予了全面否认，而对于联合国巴黎大会则举行了示威。会议对于中国和苏联的正义立场表示了全面支持。从这一个角度来看，本届会议有很大的成功。
    （九）
    会议是有成就的。这不用说是执行局全体工作人员共同努力的结果，是全体到会代表和全世界各国人民共同努力的结果。
    我们应该感谢奥地利人民、维也纳的工人阶级、工人阶级的先锋队，和奥国保卫和平委员会的朋友们的帮助。特别要考虑到维也纳是英美法苏四国共管的城市，奥国政府是社会民主党和天主教党派执行政权的政府。这个亲英美的政府对于和平运动是敌视的。它对于本届会议事实上尽了阻挠的能事。好些代表得不到签证不能到会。理事会副主席之一的南尼先生到达国境后也遭受到阻挠，到二日的晚上才赶到了会场。在这样的政权下边，奥国朋友们对于会议的支持是更加费力的。单拿交通工具一项来说，在开会期间，有好些朋友是把自己的汽车开来，而且自己充当司机，为与会的代表们服务的。三日的下午，奥国保卫和平委员会组织了一个十万人的示威游行，为世界和平理事会大壮声势。那组织的严密，规模的宏大，和在人民民主国家所见到的几乎不相上下。
    我们特别应该感谢坚强的和平堡垒苏联的坚定不移的一贯的和平政策，是这政策鼓励了全世界人民，使和平阵营增加了必胜的信念。苏联代表们特出的努力也是有目共睹的，他们的不辞劳瘁的奋斗，是使会议能够获得成就的重要的因素。
        （十）
    会议是胜利的闭幕了。各项决议在全世界范围内已经得到广泛的拥护。我们中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，在十一月十六日也早就有了声明：“认为，世界和平理事会本届会议的各项决议和告联合国与世界各国人民书中的各项主张完全符合中国人民的和平愿望，因此决定予以全部接受和坚决支持。”
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会更号召“各人民团体和全国人民团结一致，并与世界各国人民团结一致，为实现世界和平理事会本次会议的各项决定而奋斗，首先要为达成朝鲜问题、日本问题及远东，中东及北非其他各项重要问题的和平公正解决而奋斗。为了达到这个目的，全国人民必须坚决执行毛主席的指示，继续加强抗美援朝运动，增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，把抗美援朝的斗争一直进行到朝鲜问题的公平合理解决为止。”
    这声明是正确而响亮的。站在保卫和平最前哨的我们中国人民，除掉全面支持世界和平理事会所决定的保卫世界和平的一般的行动纲领之外，必须还要坚决执行我们在保卫世界和平上的特殊的行动纲领。
    我们的抗美援朝运动，事实上就是我们保卫世界和平的最好的方法。不仅抗美援朝运动和保卫和平事业是分不开来的，就是我们伟大祖国的建设事业都和保卫和平事业是分不开来的。如果我们把我们的伟大祖国建设成了像苏联一样的不可摧毁的和平堡垒，那末，保卫世界和平的事业不是有了更坚实的保障吗？努力吧，同志们！我们为消灭另一次的世界战争的危险，争取世界的持久和平而奋斗！
    世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！
    抗美援朝胜利万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！    　（新华社）
