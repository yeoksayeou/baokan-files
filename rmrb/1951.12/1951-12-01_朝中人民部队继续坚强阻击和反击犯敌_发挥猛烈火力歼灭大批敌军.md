Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th. Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to resolutely block and counterattack the invading enemy forces on the front lines, achieving victories in eliminating many enemy troops.

On the 21st, an enemy battalion invaded our army's positions at Mukkwan-dong northwest of Cheorwon, and Highlands 395.8. Our unit met them with fierce firepower, killing or wounding over 160 enemy soldiers, and forced the enemy to retreat. On the night of the same day, a unit of our army counterattacked the enemy forces that had occupied Seokyeon-dong, north of Yeoncheon. They annihilated two platoons of the 6th Company of the 8th Regiment of the U.S. Cavalry Division, as well as most of a fire support platoon. On the morning of the 23rd, an enemy regiment attacked Highland 890.2, southeast of Byeonam-dong, northwest of Yanggu, encountering stubborn resistance and heroic positional counterattacks from a unit of our army. By dusk, the enemy forces, having suffered losses, retreated. In this battle, the unit annihilated the entire 6th Company, and most of the 5th, 7th, and 8th Companies of the 5th Regiment of the 7th Division of the ROK army, killing or wounding over 600 enemy soldiers. Over 200 ROK army corpses were left abandoned in front of our army's positions alone.

On the afternoon of the 23rd, another unit of our army launched a counterattack against the enemy forces occupying the Gowangsan area southwest of Cheorwon. After a brief but intense battle, they successively captured the main peak of Gowangsan and the nearby Highlands 100, 200, and 240, annihilating the entire 5th Company and another fire support platoon of the 7th Regiment of the U.S. 3rd Division, and part of the 4th and 6th Companies. On the morning of the 24th, two enemy battalions, supported by more than a dozen aircraft and numerous artillery pieces, launched a frenzied counterattack against the area. After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy with fierce firepower, our army proactively withdrew from the main peak of Gowangsan. On the morning of the 24th, a unit of our army counterattacked the enemy on Highlands 351 and 208.3 east of Wolbisan, south of Goseong, and occupied both highlands in just over an hour of fighting. The unit also repelled an enemy counterattack, killing or wounding over 600 enemy soldiers in total. At 4 p.m., the enemy concentrated a battalion of troops to counterattack Highland 351. Our army temporarily and proactively withdrew. That night, our army, with a small force, launched a surprise attack on the enemy forces there, killing or wounding over 100 more enemy soldiers.

In addition, our army also repelled invading enemies in certain areas. In the Juao-dong area on the east bank of the Imjin River, enemy forces, with four tanks coordinating with infantry loaded on thirteen trucks, crossed the river to invade. A unit of our army bombarded them fiercely with long-range artillery fire, destroying all four enemy tanks, destroying seven of their trucks, and killing or wounding over 150 enemy infantrymen on the vehicles.
