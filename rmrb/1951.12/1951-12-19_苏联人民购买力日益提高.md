Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: TASS Moscow reports: The 14th marks the anniversary of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party announcing the resolution on currency reform and the abolition of the rationing system for food and industrial products after the war in 1947. In the past four years, the prices of goods in the Soviet Union have been reduced four times, benefiting the people by a total of 301.5 billion rubles, and the people's living standards have been greatly improved. For example, in 1949, the volume of retail trade increased by 20 percent compared to 1948, and in 1950 it increased by another 30 percent. By the end of the first post-war five-year plan, the volume of retail trade had greatly exceeded the pre-war level. All kinds of goods flow into cities and villages in large quantities through state-owned and cooperative trading organizations. Comparing the sales volume of goods in 1950 with the pre-war year of 1940, meat and meat products increased by 38 percent, fish products increased by 51 percent, butter increased by 59 percent, sugar increased by 33 percent, and various fabrics increased by 47 percent. Comparing current prices with prices after the first price reduction, bread prices have fallen by more than 40 percent, meat has fallen by more than 30 percent, and butter has fallen by 45 percent. Taking Leonov, a worker at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Moscow, as an example, several price reductions have increased his purchasing power by almost 50 percent. In addition, Leonov's monetary wage has increased by 25 percent, and his income is not only sufficient for his family of five to purchase good food and clothing and meet cultural needs, but also allows him to purchase various valuables.

    苏联人民购买力日益提高
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十四日是一九四七年苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会公布关于战后实行币制改革和取消粮食及工业品的配给办法的决议的纪念日。四年来苏联的物价曾经减低了四次，前后使人民得益三千零十五亿卢布，人民生活水平已大大提高。举例来说：一九四九年，零售贸易额比一九四八年增加了百分之二十，一九五○年又增加了百分之三十。在第一个战后五年计划结束时，零售贸易额就已大大地超过了战前水平。各式各样的货物经过国营的和合作社的贸易机构大量地流入城市和乡村。如以一九五○年货物销售量和战前一九四○年比较，肉类和肉类产品增加了百分之三十八，鱼产品增加百分之五十一，奶油增加百分之五十九，糖增加百分之三十三，各种织物增加百分之四十七。如以现在的物价和第一次减低物价之后的物价比较，面包价格下降了百分之四十以上，肉类下降了百分之三十以上，奶油下降了百分之四十五。以莫斯科“锤子与镰刀”工厂的工人里奥诺夫为例，几次降低物价使他的购买力增加了几乎百分之五十，加以里奥诺夫的货币工资增加了百分之二十五，他的收入不仅足够给他的五口之家购买良好的食物和衣着，足够供应文化的需要，而且已能购置各种贵重物品。
