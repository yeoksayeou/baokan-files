    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 5th: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on November 28th, welcoming the agreement reached on the ceasefire line issue in the Korean armistice negotiations. The "Daily Worker" said: "This first step towards an agreement should be attributed to the unyielding attitude of the Korean-Chinese negotiators towards various provocative actions, and to the expression of opinions by the American and foreign people, as well as the soldiers themselves."

    However, the "Daily Worker" warned: "There are still unresolved issues, and those who fear peace can still create thousands of new obstacles on these issues. In addition, although the ceasefire line has been drawn, the blind slaughter is still going on."

    The "Daily Worker" then emphasized: "Only if the American people speak out more forcefully than before can they guarantee peace before Christmas. Christmas has never had such great significance for the American people. Let the American people shout with all their might: Stop the slaughter immediately! Conclude the final armistice agreement before Christmas!"

    Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: TASS, London, December 4th: The Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee issued a circular calling on all peace organizations to make the greatest efforts to put pressure on the government to seek a satisfactory conclusion to the Korean armistice negotiations. The British Peace Committee warned that there is now a great force that is not only trying to prolong the Korean War, but also wants to expand the war to China. "There may be a danger that American generals, faced with the difficulty of fighting another winter war in Korea, may think they can delay negotiations and launch a full-scale offensive when the weather improves. Supplies for launching a full-scale offensive have been stockpiling." The British Peace Committee called on the British people to pass resolutions, hold rallies, and send delegations to the government and parliament to ensure peace in Korea.

    争取朝鲜在圣诞节最后停战
    英和平委员会呼吁迫使英政府结束侵朝战争
    【新华社布拉格五日电】纽约“工人日报”在十一月二十八日发表社论，欢迎在朝鲜停战谈判中就停火线问题所获得的协议。“工人日报”说：“这走向协议的第一步应该归功于朝中方面谈判代表对于各种挑衅行动的坚忍不拔的态度，这应该归功于美国和国外人民以及士兵自己表示了他们的意见。”
    但是，“工人日报”警告说：“现在还有没有解决的问题，害怕和平的人仍然可以在这些问题上制造成千的新障碍。此外，停火线虽然已经划定，盲目的屠杀还仍然在进行。”
    “工人日报”接着强调指出：“唯有美国人民比以前更有力地大声疾呼，才能保证在圣诞节前获得和平。对美国人民来说，圣诞节从来不曾有过这样重大的意义。让美国人民全力高呼：马上停止屠杀！在圣诞节前缔结最后停战协议！”
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社伦敦四日讯：英国和平委员会执行委员会发出通报，号召一切和平团体尽最大的努力，对政府施压力，以求朝鲜停战谈判圆满结束。英国和平委员会警告说：现在有一股很大的力量，它不但力图拖长朝鲜战争，还想把战争扩大到中国。“可能会有这样一种危险：美国的将领们面临着在朝鲜再打一次冬季战争的困难，所以他们认为可以拖延谈判，等到气候好转时再发动一个全面攻势，为了发动全面攻势的物资一直都在囤积。”英国和平委员会号召英国人民通过决议、举行集会、推派代表团前往政府和议会，以确保朝鲜得到和平。
