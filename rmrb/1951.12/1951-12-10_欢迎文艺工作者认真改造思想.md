    Welcome Literary and Art Workers to Conscientiously Reform Their Thinking
    Comrade Editor: As an enthusiast of literature and art, I was very excited when I saw the news that the literary and art circles in Beijing had begun rectification and study. I believe that it is very necessary for literary and art workers to carry out the struggle between the working class ideology and non-working class ideologies on the ideological front, and to conduct studies to resolutely implement Mao Zedong's line on literature and art. From this news, I saw that some literary and art workers have realized the necessity of self-reform and have begun to examine themselves and their work through criticism and self-criticism. This spirit of being responsible to the people is welcome. All literary and art workers should use this spirit to bravely expose and criticize the errors and shortcomings in their work. I hope that all literary and art workers will conscientiously reform themselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, criticize the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois tendencies in literary and art work, so that literature and art can truly become a powerful fighting weapon of the working class, and that they can create more works needed by the people, and transform themselves into truly being able to shoulder the glorious title of "writers are engineers of the human soul" as Comrade Stalin said.

    欢迎文艺工作者认真改造思想
    编辑同志：我是一个文艺爱好者，当我看到北京文艺界开始整风学习的消息后，非常兴奋。我认为文艺工作者在思想战线上开展工人阶级思想与非工人阶级思想的斗争，进行坚决贯彻毛泽东文艺路线的学习，是很必要的。从这个消息里，我看到了有些文艺工作者已经认识自我改造的必要，开始以批评和自我批评的方法来检查自己、检查工作。这种对人民负责的精神是值得欢迎的。一切文艺工作者都应该以这种精神，勇敢地揭露和批判自己工作中的错误和缺点。希望一切文艺工作者都用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想来认真改造自己，批判文艺工作中的资产阶级和小资产阶级的倾向，使文艺能够真正成为工人阶级有力的战斗武器，使自己能更多地创作出为人民所需要的作品来，改造成为真正能够担当起斯大林同志所说的“作家是人类灵魂的工程师”的光荣称号。    石明
