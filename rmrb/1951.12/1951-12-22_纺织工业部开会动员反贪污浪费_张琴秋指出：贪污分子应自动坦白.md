Ministry of Textile Industry Convenes Meeting to Mobilize Against Corruption and Waste
    Zhang Qinqiu Points Out: Corrupt Elements Should Confess Voluntarily

[This newspaper report] This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government convened a meeting of all staff members on the 19th, at which Vice Minister Zhang Qinqiu made a mobilization report on launching a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

Vice Minister Zhang Qinqiu pointed out the characteristics of the textile industry sector, saying: Many of the staff members of the Ministry of Textile Industry were transferred from the original China Textile Corporation, and some institutions were taken over intact. However, the Kuomintang's China Textile Corporation was a well-known corruption system, always referred to as "White Tigers" and "Black Tigers" ("White Tigers" referring to those who engaged in corruption in cotton transactions, and "Black Tigers" referring to those who engaged in corruption in machinery and material transactions). In the two years since liberation, the staff members of textile institutions at all levels have generally been clean and hardworking, but the phenomenon of corruption has not been completely eliminated, and the exploitative ideas of the bourgeoisie, such as hedonism, corruption, and bending the law for personal gain, are eroding our cadres like poison. The phenomenon of corruption is developing. Bureaucracy is the nest where corruption and waste can hide and thrive. Among the corruption cases that have already been exposed, there is the case of Chen Xianfan, Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, and others colluding with private merchants to collectively embezzle 3 billion yuan worth of raw materials. Kang Shengsan, the "three-dynasty veteran" chief of the personnel section of the Shenyang Textile Factory of the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau, colluded with private merchants to steal and resell good cotton back to the factory, causing the state to lose 15 billion Northeast yuan. In addition, there are several corruption cases that have been discovered but not yet dealt with. The phenomenon of waste is also very serious. According to preliminary estimates by the East China Textile Administration Bureau in May of this year, the total value of waste in various factories in one year will reach 150 billion yuan. These facts show that it is necessary to launch a vigorous movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, just like suppressing counter-revolutionaries, to thoroughly eliminate the corrupt and exploitative ideas left over from the Kuomintang era and those that have been infiltrated by the bourgeoisie, establish new morality, and create new work styles from the ideological and practical perspectives.

Vice Minister Zhang emphasized that it is necessary to adopt the method of rectification to carry out this movement to the end. As long as we thoroughly eliminate these phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we can build several new factories for the country. This will have a significant effect on strengthening the power to resist America and aid Korea, and accelerating the country's industrialization process. All comrades must attach importance to and actively participate in this movement, and through this movement, test themselves and improve their ideological understanding.

Vice Minister Zhang requested all comrades to fully promote democracy. Leading cadres, in particular, must support the opinions of the masses and not allow anyone to suppress criticism. Anyone who suppresses criticism must be punished. Those who have engaged in corruption should confess voluntarily. Those who confess voluntarily will be given lenient punishment. In the movement, those model workers who are honest and devoted to their duties, abide by Article 18 of the Common Program, have a high degree of dedication, creativity, and create wealth for the people should be commended. At the same time, through this movement, systems should be rectified and improved, and work efficiency should be improved.

Vice Minister Zhang also summarized the study of increasing production and practicing economy from November 12 to the 18th of this month, pointing out that all staff members, due to their enthusiastic response to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, have initially exposed four corruption cases, including taking kickbacks, misappropriating public funds, and falsely reporting travel expenses, and exposed 27 waste cases, including waste in repairs, purchases, and conference receptions. In addition, bureaucratic and red tape styles are also quite serious. Due to carelessness in work, official documents were sent incorrectly, and long-distance telephone calls were used to notify corrections, which cost 14 telephone fees in one instance. In another instance, official documents notifying meetings in various places were sent late, and 80 telegrams were sent to supplement them. Of the 1,080 documents received in July, 590 required official action, of which 117 were backlogged, including one that had been backlogged for more than four months, six for more than three months, 65 for more than two months, and 47 for more than one month, accounting for 20% of all documents that needed to be processed. As a result of this preliminary study, in November alone, the cost of postage and telecommunications was reduced by 3.6 million yuan compared with October; individual departments also formulated specific numerical plans for increasing production and practicing economy.

Vice Minister Zhang pointed out that this study has achieved results, but in the later stage of the study, the National Textile Industry Conference was held, and most of the responsible cadres devoted all their energy to the conference, so the study needs to be continued in depth. In particular, the fight against corruption has not yet been deepened. Corruption is a shameful and despicable act of stealing state wealth, and a serious struggle is needed against this phenomenon.

    纺织工业部开会动员反贪污浪费
    张琴秋指出：贪污分子应自动坦白 【本报讯】中央人民政府纺织工业部在十九日召开了全体工作人员大会，张琴秋副部长在会上作了关于开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的动员报告。
    张琴秋副部长指出纺织工业部门的特点说：纺织工业部不少的工作人员，是从原中纺公司转来的，有些机构更是原封不动地接收过来。而国民党的中纺公司恰恰是有名的贪污系统，一向有所谓“白老虎”“黑老虎”之称（“白老虎”是指在棉花买卖中进行贪污的分子，“黑老虎”是指机料物料买卖中的贪污分子）。解放两年来，各级纺织机构工作人员，总的说是清廉刻苦的，但贪污的现象并未完全清除，而资产阶级的享乐腐化、贪污枉法的剥削思想，正像毒素一样侵蚀到我们的干部中来。贪污现象在发展中。而官僚主义正是贪污浪费得以藏身和滋长的巢穴。就已经揭发的贪污案件中，即有华东纺织管理局计划处副处长陈贤凡等，勾结私商，集体贪污染料三十亿元的事件。东北纺织管理局沈阳纺织厂人事科长“三朝元老”康省三等勾结私商，盗卖好棉花又转卖给工厂，使国家损失东北币一百五十亿元。此外，尚有已经发觉但未处理的贪污案数宗。浪费现象亦非常严重，据华东纺织管理局今年五月初步估计，一年中各厂浪费总值将达一千五百亿元。这些事实说明了必须像镇压反革命一样，大张旗鼓地展开一个反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，从思想上行动上肃清国民党时代残留下来的和资产阶级侵入进来的贪污腐化的剥削思想，树立新道德，建立新作风。
    张副部长强调指出，必须采取整风的方式，把这个运动进行到底。只要我们彻底地肃清这些贪污浪费及官僚主义现象，就可以给国家多建设几个新厂。这对于加强抗美援朝力量，加速国家的工业化过程，将有重大的作用。全体同志要重视和积极地参加这一运动，通过这一运动，考验自己，从思想认识上提高一步。
    张副部长要求全体同志，充分发扬民主，领导干部尤其要支持群众意见，不允许任何人压制批评。凡压制批评者，必须受处分。有贪污行为的分子，应自动坦白。凡是自动坦白的，从轻处分。在运动中，对于那些廉洁奉公、遵守共同纲领第十八条规定、具有高度事业心、创造性、为人民创造财富的模范工作人员，应给予表扬。同时通过这一运动，整顿与健全制度，提高工作效率。
    张副部长也总结了从十一月十二日开始，至本月十八日止的增产节约的学习，指出全体工作人员，由于热烈响应毛主席的增产节约号召，初步揭发了贪污事件四宗，包括吃回扣，挪用公款，虚报车费等事实，暴露了浪费事件二十七宗，包括修检、购置、会议招待等等浪费。此外，官僚主义文牍主义作风也相当严重。因工作粗心大意，公文错发，以长途电话通知修改，一次即花了十四次电话费。另一次通知各地开会公文迟发又补发电报八十封。七月份收文一千另八十件，需办公文五百九十件中，积压一百十七件，其中积压四个月以上者一件，三个月以上者六件，两个月以上者六十五件，一个月以上者四十七件，占全部需要处理的公文百分之二十。由于进行了这一初步学习，十一月份内，单是邮电费用一项，即比十月份减少三百六十万元；个别部门并且订出了具体的增产节约的数字计划。
    张副部长指出这一学习是有成绩的，但学习后期适逢召开全国纺织工业会议，大部分负责干部将全部精力投入于大会中，因此学习有待继续深入。特别是在反对贪污这方面还远没有深入下去。而贪污行为正是盗窃国家财富的可耻可卑的行为，需要向这种现象作严重的斗争。（俞鲤庭）
