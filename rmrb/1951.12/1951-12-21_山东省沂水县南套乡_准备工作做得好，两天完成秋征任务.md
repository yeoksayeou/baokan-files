    Good Preparatory Work Leads to Autumn Grain Collection Completion in Two Days

    Comrade Editor: In Nantao Township, Eleventh District of Yishui County, Shandong Province, the autumn grain collection task was completed by the farmers in two days due to good preparations. Some handed in cotton, and some handed in grain. The entire autumn grain collection task was completed. Before the autumn grain collection, the township repeatedly checked and collectively evaluated the amount of cotton and grain to be handed in by each household; and according to the amount to be handed in, made detailed plans according to the labor situation and grain transportation tools, while also taking care of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and disabled veterans without labor power, with mutual aid teams helping them with delivery.

    In order to ensure orderly grain delivery to the granary, the township also formed grain delivery brigades based on villages before the grain delivery, divided into teams and groups, and democratically elected team leaders and group leaders. Therefore, although a large number of young and middle-aged people in the township participated in the diversion of the Yi and Shu rivers, because the villages had made full preparations and organizational work for the autumn grain collection in advance, and under the leadership of Party members and cadres, many women in literacy classes also actively participated in the grain delivery, the cotton and grain warehousing work was completed in two days, and the specifications met the requirements of being dry, clean, and uniform.

    山东省沂水县南套乡
    准备工作做得好，两天完成秋征任务
    编辑同志：山东省沂水县十一区南套乡，由于秋征准备工作做得好，农民在两天内就完成了秋征任务。有的交棉花，有的交粮食。全部完成了秋征任务。还在秋征以前，这个乡就把各户应缴的棉、粮，进行了反复的检查和集体评比；并根据应缴的数目，按照劳力情况和送粮工具，作了精密的计划，同时还照顾到无劳动力的烈、军属和荣誉军人，以代耕组为单位给他们代送。
    为了做到有秩序地送粮入库，这个乡在送粮以前，还以村为单位，成立了送粮大队，下分小队和组，民主选出队长和组长。因此，虽然这个乡有大批青壮年参加了导沭工作，但因为村里事前对秋征作了充分的准备和组织工作，同时在党员、干部带头下，不少识字班的妇女也都积极参加到送粮行列里去，所以在两天的时间内就完成了棉、粮入仓工作，并且在规格上都能达到干、净、匀的要求。
