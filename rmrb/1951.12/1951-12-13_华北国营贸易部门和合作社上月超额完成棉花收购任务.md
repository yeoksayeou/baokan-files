Strengthen Cotton and Grain Purchase Work
North China State-Owned Trading Departments and Cooperatives
Exceeded Cotton Purchase Tasks Last Month
    North China's state-owned trading departments and cooperatives overfulfilled the November new cotton purchase and transfer tasks. The total amount of ginned cotton purchased in the region in November exceeded the purchase plan by 5.55 percent, with Shanxi Province exceeding the plan by 20.46 percent and Hebei Province exceeding the plan by 10.64 percent; the regional raw cotton transfer task exceeded the original plan by 8.57 percent.
    The main problems in the cotton purchase work in North China are the localism and purely profit-oriented viewpoints of some cooperative cadres, which have affected the timely processing of seed cotton in individual areas. For example, the Wangdu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, has stockpiled 1.8 million jin of seed cotton due to insufficient ginning capacity. When the Baoding Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperative wanted to allocate a portion of it to be processed by other counties, the Wangdu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative reported that it only had 1.3 million jin of seed cotton, and reported only 230 cotton gins when they actually had 320, thus causing a large amount of seed cotton to be stockpiled and unable to be processed in time.

    加强棉粮收购工作华北国营贸易部门和合作社
    上月超额完成棉花收购任务
    华北区国营贸易部门和合作社超额完成十一月份新棉收购和调运任务。全区十一月份收购皮棉总数超过收购计划百分之五点五五，其中山西省超过计划百分之二十点四六，河北省超过计划百分之十点六四；全区原棉调运任务超过原订计划百分之八点五七。
    华北区目前收棉工作中的主要问题，是某些合作社干部的本位主义思想和单纯营利观点，影响了个别地区籽棉的及时加工。例如河北省保定专区望都县供销合作社因轧花能力不足，积压籽棉一百八十万斤，当保定专区供销合作社要调拨其中的一部分由外县加工时，望都县供销合作社却报告只有籽棉一百三十万斤，把仅有的二百三十辆轧车报成三百二十辆，这样使大量籽棉积压下来，不能及时加工。    　（新华社）
