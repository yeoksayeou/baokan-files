Editorial Note: Our newspaper has received more than sixty letters to Chairman Mao from the people in the disaster areas of Taolin County and other places in Suiyuan Province. In these letters, the people in the disaster areas express their gratitude to Chairman Mao for his concern and sympathy. They pledge to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, organize themselves, engage in production for self-relief, and ensure that no one goes hungry or cold. Below are three of these letters.

Respected Chairman Mao:
\tOur county has suffered severe disasters this year, and many villagers who were unable to make a living have received relief from the government. However, you are still concerned and have sent a delegation to express your sympathy on your behalf.
\tDear Chairman Mao, please rest assured! Although our county has suffered severe disasters, we will certainly act according to your instructions to ensure that no one goes hungry or cold. Now, many workers who cannot work in the winter have joined the work of opening coal mines, and their living difficulties have been resolved. In Taolin County, which has been severely affected by the disaster, there is no sound of hunger or cold. The workers in our county were moved to tears by your visit. You are truly our savior. We will definitely follow your call, overcome the disaster, and lay the foundation for next year's production.
\t\tAll Workers of Taolin County, Suiyuan

Respected Chairman Mao:
\tThe delegation you sent has arrived in our village. You are truly concerned about us! Thinking back to before liberation, our village had 40 households with 180 people, but only 11 head of cattle, of which only eight could be used for work. We didn't have even a single donkey or sheep. The whole village cultivated about 600 mu of land, but the grain yield was very low, and most of it was taken away by the landlords.
\tNow everything is fine, we are liberated. Our poor peasants have social status and are no longer subject to the rule and exploitation of those feudal landlords and bullies. In terms of production, thanks to the relief from the people's government and various loans, production materials have also developed. This year, our village cultivated 2,415.7 mu of land, raised 52 head of cattle, 14 donkeys, and 72 sheep, as well as many chickens and pigs. These newly added things were all brought to us by you and the Communist Party.
\tThis year, we suffered a drought here, and you were worried that we would not be able to survive the famine, so you allocated a lot of relief clothing, food, and funds to us, and also sent people to express your sympathy, which we are very grateful for. A few days ago, every household in our village made a famine relief plan. We must use the spirit of "man will conquer nature" and mutual assistance and love, and consolidate the five different types of disaster relief groups that have been organized, according to your call. This winter, we will exchange another 20 shi of grain, and next spring, we will try our best to spare time for afforestation, road construction, transportation, medicinal herb digging and other work to overcome the famine.
\t\tAll members of the Reading Group of Shizita, Qingshuihe County, Suiyuan Province

Respected Chairman Mao:
\tToday we have turned over and gained freedom and happiness. Although our area has suffered a disaster this year and the lives of the general public are relatively difficult, under the leadership of the People's Government, we have come up with many ways to engage in production for self-relief. The government gave us loans, and we organized ourselves to engage in transportation. Some places opened canals and dug wells to engage in sideline production. In this way, we solved the problem of food shortages for two or three months, and were able to save some grain to prepare for next spring's seeds. We have already done these things specifically, so the general poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed and say that if it were not for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we would not be able to overcome this year's disaster. Our only hope is that the government will lead us to solve the problem of seed shortages next year. Our central task now is to welcome the land reform, which is a great happy event for us.

    绥远灾区人民纷纷写信感谢毛主席的关怀和慰问
    编辑部说明：本报接到绥远省灾区陶林县等地人民给毛主席的六十多封信。灾区人民在这些信中，感谢毛主席对他们的关怀和慰问。他们保证执行毛主席的指示，组织起来，生产自救，不让一个人挨饿受冻。下面是其中的三封来信。敬爱的毛主席：我县今年灾情严重，许多无法生活的老乡们，都得到了政府的救济。但您还不放心，又派了慰问团，代表您来慰问我们。
    亲爱的毛主席，请您放心吧！虽然我县灾情严重，但我们一定要按照您的指示行动起来，保证不让一个人挨饿受冻。现在许多在冬天不能工作的工人，都参加了开煤窑的工作，生活困难都得到了解决。在灾情严重的陶林县，听不到饥寒的声音。我县工人，这次得到您的慰问，都感激得流出泪来。您真是我们的救星。我们一定依照您的号召，把灾荒度过，并打下明年的生产基础。
   绥远陶林县全体工人
    敬爱的毛主席：您派来的慰问团，已经到了我们村上。您真是太关心我们啦！回想在没有解放以前，我们村四十户人家，一百八十人，只养着十一条牛，里面只有八头是能使唤的，毛驴和羊一只也没有。全村共种了六百来亩土地，打粮食很少，可是这些粮食差不多都给地主占去了。
    现在好了，我们解放了。咱贫苦农民有了社会地位，再也不受那些封建地主、恶霸的统治和剥削了。在生产方面，由于人民政府的救济和各种贷款的帮助，各种生产资料也发展起来了。今年我们村就种了二千四百一十五亩七分土地，养了五十二头牛，十四头驴子，七十二只羊，还有不少的鸡和猪。这些新增加的东西，都是您和共产党给我们带来的。
    今年我们这里闹了旱灾，您又不放心，怕我们度不过荒去，给我们拨来了好多的救济衣、救济粮和救济款，还派人来慰问我们，真使我们感激。前几天我们家家户户都订了度荒计划。我们一定要用人定胜天、互助友爱的精神，依据您的号召，靠山吃山，把已经组织起来的五个不同种类的救灾小组巩固下去。我们今冬要再往回打换二十石粮食，到明年春季，尽量抽空植树造林、修公路、跑运输、刨药材和作其他工作，来战胜天荒。绥远省清水河县狮子塔读报组全体组员
    敬爱的毛主席：我们今天翻身了，得到自由幸福。我们这个地方今年虽然受灾，一般群众的生活比较困难，但是在人民政府的领导下，我们想出好多办法生产自救。政府贷给我们款，我们组织起来跑运输。有的地方开渠打井搞副业。这样，我们解决了两三个月的口粮困难，并且能节省下一部分粮食，准备明年春天的籽种。这些事我们已经具体地做到了，所以一般贫雇中农都是欢天喜地地说，要不是毛主席共产党，我们今年的灾荒就无法度过。我们唯一的希望，就是要政府来领导我们解决明年籽种的困难。我们现在的中心工作，就是迎接土地改革了，这是我们的大喜事。阳湾子村民    刘二厚生
