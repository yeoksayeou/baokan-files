    Struggle to Increase Yield Per Unit Area
    Farmers in Chuandi Village Organize to Improve Techniques
    Increasing Grain Production by Forty-Four Jin Per Mu This Year
    Chuandi Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has had a bumper harvest this year. Grain production increased by an average of forty-four jin per mu, exceeding the original production increase plan by 76 percent. The average yield per mu in the village this year is 384 jin, exceeding last year's output by 21.9 percent and exceeding the output before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 90 percent. In particular, the Guo Yu'en high-yield group averaged 432 jin of grain per mu. Guo Yu'en himself also created a record of producing 840 jin of corn on eight fen (high-yield experimental plot) of land.

    Why such a high yield? Mainly because of the organization to improve farming techniques. Chuandi Village is a small village in a mountain valley with only ninety-four households, of which eighty-eight households have formed ten mutual aid groups. Each mutual aid group has a technical team that continuously studies and improves farming techniques. This year, they have 605 mu of autumn land, which they hoed three times, applying 95 dan of fertilizer per mu. They also promoted improved varieties and universally implemented seed soaking and seed dressing. For example, Guo Yu'en's eight fen high-yield experimental field was planted with the improved variety "Golden Queen." In addition, they also used new agricultural tools, such as using a five-inch walking plow to till the land, a chaff cutter to cut grass, and a thresher to thresh corn. This not only saved labor but also increased production by 120 shi of grain. They saved more than 2,000 workdays and used them for sideline production, increasing income by another 285 shi.　Liu Shengquan

    为提高单位面积产量而斗争
    川底村农民组织起来改进技术
    今年每亩地增产四十四斤粮食
    山西平顺县川底村今年丰收了。每亩地平均增产四十四斤粮，超过原来增产计划百分之七十六。这个村今年每亩地的平均产量是三百八十四斤，超过去年产量百分之二十一点九，超过抗日战争前的产量百分之九十。特别是郭玉恩丰产组，每亩平均产粮食四百三十二斤。郭玉恩本人还创造了八分地（丰产试验田）产玉茭八百四十斤的纪录。
    为什么会这样丰产呢？主要是因为组织起来改进农作技术的缘故。川底村是一个山沟小村，只有九十四户人家，其中有八十八户组成了十个互助组。每个互助组内都有技术小组，他们不断研究提高耕作技术。今年秋地六百零五亩，他们把这些地普遍锄到三遍，每亩施肥达九十五担。他们还推广了优良品种，全部做到了浸种、拌种。如郭玉恩的八分丰产试验田就是种的优良品种金皇后。另外，他们还使用了新式农具，如用五吋步犁耕地，用铡草机铡草，用脱粒机脱玉茭，这样不但省工，还增产了一百二十石粮食。他们省下共两千多个工用到副业生产上去，又增多收入二百八十五石。　刘生泉
