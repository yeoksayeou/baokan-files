    The Zhonghua Brick Factory Blindly Trusted a Foreman, Causing a Chimney Collapse Accident

    To the Editor: The Zhonghua Brick Factory, belonging to the Supply Department of the General Logistics Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission, built a new rotary kiln and chimney in August of this year. Due to improper design and blindly relying on the foreman's construction, the chimney collapsed, causing a great waste. This project, from design to construction, was contracted by foreman Zhao Zideng. The factory did not study whether his design drawings conformed to local conditions before deciding to start construction. After construction began, it was discovered that the groundwater level was high and the soil quality was poor, necessitating a reduction in the chimney's original planned height. However, Zhao Zideng did not change the chimney height. Moreover, when building the chimney, he did not prepare rope scaffolding or equipment to check verticality, allowing workers with poor skills to work carelessly. The chimney became increasingly crooked as it was built. Although factory cadres had seen the danger, they still believed Zhao Zideng's lie that he could hire skilled workers to straighten the chimney. Soon, the upper half of the crooked chimney collapsed, damaging part of the rotary kiln. According to post-incident statistics, the incident resulted in a loss of more than 58.74 million yuan in material costs and 50 million yuan in labor costs. The factory has now conducted a review, but is still attempting to repair two more zhang (a Chinese unit of length), so that the rotary kiln body can barely be lit to fire bricks, and then completely demolished and rebuilt next year. We believe this method of failing to take decisive measures is wrong.

    中华制砖厂盲目相信把头造成烟囱倒塌事故
    编辑同志：中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总后勤部供应处所属中华制砖厂，在今年八月新建了转盘窑和烟囱。由于没有正确设计，盲目地依靠把头施工，以致烟囱倒塌，造成很大浪费。这个工程，从设计到施工，都是由工头赵子登承包的。厂方不研究他的设计图样是否合乎当地情况，就决定动工。开工后发现地下水位较高，土质也不好，必须减低烟囱原定高度。但赵子登并不改变烟囱高度，而且，当砌烟囱时，也不备绳杆架木和检查垂直的设备，任凭手艺很差的工人，马马虎虎地施工。烟囱越砌上去越歪，厂里干部虽然已看出有危险，但仍然相信赵子登说的能请技术好的工人把烟囱修直的谎话。不久，歪烟囱的上半截塌了下来，砸坏了转盘窑的一部分。事后统计，这次事件共损失材料费五千八百七十四万多元，工价五千万元。这个厂现在已做了检讨，但还企图再接修两丈，使转盘窑身勉强能点火烧砖，到明年再全部拆除重修。我们认为这种不能采取断然措施的方法是错误的。
