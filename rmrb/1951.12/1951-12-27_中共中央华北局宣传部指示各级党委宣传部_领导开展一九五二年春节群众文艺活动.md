    The Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on December 17th regarding mass cultural activities for the 1952 Spring Festival. It called on propaganda departments of party committees at all levels to launch a broad, mass-based propaganda campaign based on Chairman Mao’s great call to "Increase Production and Practice Economy to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers" and the work tasks of North China in 1952.

    The instructions require propaganda departments of party committees at all levels to establish a temporary guidance committee in conjunction with local cultural and educational departments and art troupes, responsible for leading, reviewing, and evaluating the work. Local propagandists should participate in guiding mass cultural activities. Art leadership organizations should mobilize and organize artists – writers, artists, musicians, playwrights, and some members of art troupes – to go to factories, rural areas, and military companies before the Spring Festival to guide the masses, learn from the masses, and discover unknown authors among the masses to cultivate them; oppose standing idly by and adopting a guest-like attitude when going to the countryside.

    The instructions require local cultural and educational leadership departments, in addition to mobilizing the masses to create and perform various programs themselves, to promptly supply the masses with singing materials through newspapers and periodicals. To better carry out mass cultural activities for the Spring Festival, the instructions require all localities to summarize past experiences in cultural activities and mass creations, promote the healthy and positive elements in artistic creation and cultural activities, and oppose backward, decadent, superstitious, pornographic, and vulgar elements; oppose extravagance and waste, disregard for content, and a focus only on form; oppose the vilification of the working people and a failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; oppose a failure to distinguish between ancient and modern times, using old opera costumes and methods to perform new people and new events, or forcing modern ideas into historical dramas, or deliberately distorting history to insinuate modern times and other anti-historical tendencies. In minority areas, attention should be paid to harmony and unity among all ethnic groups, and performances of operas that may harm ethnic feelings and friendship should be prevented.

    领导开展一九五二年春节群众文艺活动
    中共中央华北局宣传部在本月十七日发出关于一九五二年春节群众文艺活动指示，号召各级党委宣传部根据毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召和华北一九五二年工作任务，开展一个广泛的群众性的宣传运动。
    指示要求各级党委宣传部，结合当地文教部门和文艺团体，组织一个临时性的指导委员会，负责领导、审查和评选工作。各地宣传员应参加对群众文艺活动的领导。文艺领导机关应动员和组织文艺工作者——作家、美术家、音乐家、戏剧家和文工团的一部分力量，在春节前下厂、下乡、下连队，辅导群众，向群众学习，发现群众中的无名作者，加以培养；反对袖手旁观，下乡作客的态度。
    指示要求各地文教领导部门除发动群众自编自演各种节目外，必须通过报纸刊物，及时供应群众演唱材料。为更好地开展群众的春节文艺活动，指示要求各地总结过去文艺活动的经验和群众创作，发扬文艺创作和文艺活动中健康的、积极的因素，反对落后的、颓废的、迷信的、色情的和低级趣味的因素；反对铺张浪费、不重内容、只顾形式的作风；反对丑化劳动人民，敌我不分；反对古今不分，用旧戏的服饰和方法来表演新人新事及以现代的思想硬装到历史剧中去，或故意歪曲历史来影射现代等的反历史主义倾向。在少数民族地区，应注意各民族间的和睦团结，防止有伤民族感情和友谊的戏曲的演出。    （新华社）
