Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 28th: The latest issue (No. 52) of New Era magazine published an editorial reviewing the international situation in 1951, stating: 1951 was an eventful year. In the past year, the US imperialists declared a national emergency at home and expanded the rearmament plan to an unprecedented scale. They have torn off all pretenses in their relations with Western Europe and frankly demanded that Western Europe arm itself endlessly, turning itself into a US military base and a bridgehead for aggression. The United States has been creating new centers of conflict and bloodshed; the United States openly wants to use aggressive pacts to ensnare the entire capitalist and colonial world, making it dense with a network of military bases. As a result, the past year has been a year of further economic chaos in capitalist countries, a year of increasing inflation, soaring prices, increased taxes, and a sharp decline in the living standards of workers. This year, the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, was divided and disintegrated due to internal discord and contradictions. The US imperialists face the hatred of the people not only in countries threatened with aggression, but also in their puppet states.

    The armed attack on the Korean people has proven to be a hopeless adventure. The ordinary people of the world have deep sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers against the barbarous aggressors.

    The editorial continued: In the peace and democracy camp, 1951 was marked by many noteworthy events, which proved that the efforts of the people of all countries to prevent a new war are becoming increasingly strengthened.

    In February 1951, the great Stalin's talk on the current international situation resounded throughout the world. He said, "Peace can be maintained and consolidated if the people of all countries take up the cause of defending peace and defend it to the end." The World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peace pact between the five major powers has been endorsed by hundreds of millions of people; these signatures demonstrate their firm determination not to allow a new world war to occur, and constitute another stern warning to warmongers. The powerful world peace movement is growing stronger, uniting the progressive humanity of the world and supported by the people of all countries.

    In the past year, the socialist economy and culture of the Soviet Union have continued to develop. The report for the first ten months of this year has clearly demonstrated that, as in previous years, the Soviet national economic plan for 1951 will be overfulfilled. Soviet science, art, and literature have also achieved remarkable achievements.

    In the people's democracies of Europe, the main industries had completed their 1951 production plans before the year came to an end. News of great progress in peaceful construction labor also came from the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic.

    However, for the imperialist camp, the first year of the second half of the twentieth century was a year of disappointment. Atomic diplomacy suffered one setback after another. The efforts of American diplomats and generals to establish the West German defense force as the basis of the so-called European army have been resolutely opposed by the people of all countries, resulting in increasing distrust of the United States in Western Europe.

    The plan to establish a Middle East Command, a subsidiary of the Atlantic Group, has proven to be stillborn; not a single Arab country is eager to join this plan.

    The imperialists have been unable to thwart the national liberation movement in Malaya, to conquer heroic Vietnam, or to force Korea to its knees; on the contrary, the anti-imperialist movements in colonial and dependent countries are constantly growing in scale and strength.

    The struggle against imperialist oppression may take different forms in different countries depending on the circumstances. For example, Egypt and Iran are fighting in their own ways. However, it is an undeniable fact that imperialism cannot thwart this movement, cannot rebuild its rule, and cannot restore its original position. The only way out that imperialism can see is to rashly launch another world war; but this will only make it sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of unsolvable internal and external contradictions.

    The class struggle in the capitalist world is becoming increasingly tense. When workers go on strike to defend their rights, they also protest against the policies of war, poverty, and hunger. They demand an end to the expansion of armaments and a peace pact between the five major powers.

    The imperialists have also suffered defeats on the diplomatic front. The United States continues to operate the voting machine in the United Nations, but this machine is no longer as handy as it used to be. Soviet representatives and representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia have effectively exposed the tricks of the United States in the United Nations.

    The editorial emphasized that the Soviet Union's policy of promoting international peace and friendship exposes the true colors of the warmongers. This policy is reflected in the close ties between the Soviet people and people's organizations and the people and people's organizations of other countries (whether capitalist or non-capitalist). In 1951, several thousand men and women from all walks of life with different political views visited the Soviet Union. They saw that the Soviet people were calm, confident, and not intimidated by threats, and that everyone was doing their best for peace in their own positions.

    The editorial concluded: The Soviet people calmly bid farewell to 1951, because this year was a year of brilliant achievements in domestic peaceful construction labor, and a year of expansion and development of the international peace movement.

    新时代杂志发表社论综述一九五一年国际形势
    过去的一年是国际和平运动扩展的一年
    对帝国主义阵营说来是四分五裂和处处遭受挫败的一年
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：最近一期（第五十二期）新时代杂志发表社论综述一九五一年的国际形势说：一九五一年是多事的一年。在过去一年内，美帝国主义者在国内宣布了全国紧急状态，并且把重整军备计划扩展到了空前的规模。他们在对西欧的关系上已撕下了一切假面具，而直率地要求西欧永无休止地武装起来，变成美国的军事基地和侵略的桥头堡垒。美国一直在制造纠纷和流血的新中心；美国公开要用侵略公约把整个资本主义和殖民地世界网罗起来，使它密布军事基地网。结果，过去一年是资本主义国家的经济进一步混乱的一年，是通货日趋膨胀、物价飞涨、赋税大增、工人生活水准急剧下降的一年。这
    一年内，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营内部由于充满不和与矛盾而四分五裂。美帝国主义者不仅在以侵略相威胁的国家里，而且在它的仆从国家里也一样面临着人民的憎恨。
    武装进攻朝鲜人民已证明是无望的冒险。全世界普通人民对于朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军反抗野蛮的侵略者的英勇斗争，都寄予深切的同情。
    社论接着说：在和平民主阵营中，一九五一年是以许多值得注意的事件为标志的，这些事件证明了各国人民防止新战争的努力越来越增强了。
    一九五一年二月，伟大的斯大林关于目前国际形势的谈话响彻了全世界，他说：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”世界和平理事会发表的要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，已获得了数亿人民的签名拥护；这些签名表现了他们不容许新的世界战争发生的坚定决心，而构成了对战争贩子的又一个严峻的警告。强大的世界和平运动正在日益发展壮大，它团结了全世界的进步人类，并得到了各国人民的支持。
    在过去的一年中，苏联社会主义经济和文化在继续发展。今年头十个月的报告已经明白地证明，正如往年一样，一九五一年苏联国民经济计划将会超额完成。苏联科学、艺术和文学的各部门也获得了卓越的成就。
    在欧洲各人民民主国家，各主要工业在一年将近结束以前就已完成了它们的一九五一年生产计划。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国也传来了和平建设劳动获得巨大进展的消息。
    但是，对帝国主义阵营说来，二十世纪后半期的第一年则是失望的一年。原子外交接二连三地遭到挫败。美国外交官和将领们要建立作为所谓欧洲军基础的西德国防军的努力，遭到了各国人民的坚决反对，结果使西欧越来越不信任美国。
    建立大西洋集团附属机构中东司令部的计划已经证明流产了；没有一个阿拉伯国家急于要想置身于这个计划中。
    帝国主义者无法挫败马来亚的民族解放运动，无法征服英勇的越南，或迫使朝鲜屈膝；相反地，殖民地和附属国家反帝国主义运动，不论在规模上和力量上都在不断地发展壮大着。
    反抗帝国主义压迫的斗争，可能根据情况而在不同的国家中采取不同的方式，例如埃及和伊朗都在以它们自己的方式进行斗争，但是，帝国主义不能挫败这种运动，不能重建它的统治和恢复原来的地位，则是无可争辩的事实了。帝国主义所能看到的唯一出路就是贸然发动另一次世界大战；但是这只有使它在无法解决的内外矛盾的泥淖中愈陷愈深。
    资本主义世界中的阶级斗争愈来愈趋紧张。当工人们举行罢工保卫他们的权利时，他们也对战争、贫穷和饥饿的政策表示了抗议。他们要求停止扩张军备，要求五大国缔结和平公约。
    帝国主义者在外交战线上也处处失利。美国继续在联合国中开动表决机器，但是这个机器不再像以前那样得心应手了。苏联代表和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的代表们在联合国中有效地揭露了美国的诡计。
    社论强调说：苏联的促进国际和平与友好的政策，暴露了战争贩子的本色。这个政策表现在苏联人民和人民团体与其他国家（不论是资本主义国家还是非资本主义国家）的人民和人民团体的紧密联系上。在一九五一年内，有好几千政见不同的外国各界男女访问了苏联。他们看到苏联人民是镇静的，有信心不会为威胁所吓倒，并且每个人都在自己的岗位上尽力为和平而努力。
    社论最后说：苏联人民镇静地向一九五一年告别，因为这一年是国内和平建设劳动获得辉煌成就的一年，是国际和平运动扩大和发展的一年。
