Several Han Dynasty tombs have been discovered in the suburbs of Beijing. In the eastern suburbs: In 1948, a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army discovered a Han tomb south of Gaobeidian Village, fifteen li southeast of Chaoyangmen. In April of this year, the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government organized an excavation team to carry out excavations, first excavating north and south at the brick tomb site discovered in the western part of Nangang, three li south of Gaobeidian Village (namely Tomb No. 1), and discovered the main chamber, front chamber, and rear chamber. At the same time, trial excavations were carried out on its east side, and another tomb was discovered, with a front chamber, rear chamber, and side chambers (namely Tomb No. 2). In total, the excavated items include bronze mirrors, Han Wuzhu coins, Xin Huo Quan coins, iron remnants, glass ear ornaments, pottery, and funerary objects. From observing the images of the artifacts and further verifying them with the unearthed currency, it can be determined that these two tombs are relics of the Xin Dynasty (9-23 AD) or the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD).

In the northern suburbs of the capital, a Han Dynasty tomb was discovered in April of this year, two li northwest of Qinghe Town. To the west of the Han tomb, southeast of the Qinghe Grand Building, ancient tombs were also discovered, and the excavation of these tombs began in June of this year. After completion, the tomb of Yang Shixian and Zhang, the prefect of Weizhou in the sixth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty, was excavated nearby. At the same time, tile coffin clusters and a Han Dynasty residential site near a brick factory north of Zhufang Village were also excavated. During the excavation of the ancient tomb southeast of the Qinghe Grand Building, a skull and a set of bones (the order of which was disordered, proving it had been looted) were discovered, as well as many Wuzhu coins, bronze knives, daggers, writing knives, bronze mirrors (fragments), silver bracelets, cicada-shaped jade mouth pieces, jade pigs, pottery figurines, pottery, funerary objects, iron remnants, lacquer coffins, and fragments of lacquerware. After expert research, these were determined to be items from the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD), and possibly artifacts from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC - 25 AD). From the unearthed artifacts, one can see the living conditions of the people at that time, the development of the lacquer industry, and the skills of construction.

More than half a li north of Zhufang Village, during soil excavation, a layer of gray soil was discovered, containing many fragments of pottery tiles, stone mortars, and iron tools. Nearby, four brick wells were also discovered, which, judging from their shape, are all artifacts from the Han Dynasty. To its north is a pottery well; north of the pottery well is a cluster of tile coffins, in which an infant skull was discovered. The finds here are also pre-Qin (at the latest, Han Dynasty) artifacts. To the east of the tile coffin excavation site, two supine burials were excavated, one of which had a "Da Quan Wu Shi" coin on the ear, which may be the burial site of commoners in the Western Han Dynasty.

The cultural relics unearthed in the suburbs of Beijing mentioned above are all displayed in the Beijing History Museum. These artifacts illustrate that the culture of our great motherland's capital has a reliable history of at least two thousand years.

### 北京近郊发见汉代古墓多处

    北京近郊发见汉代古墓多处
    北京近郊发见汉代古墓多处。在东郊：一九四八年中国人民解放军某部于朝阳门东南十五里高碑店村南，发见了汉墓。今年四月间中央人民政府文化部文物局组织发掘队从事发掘，先就高碑店村南三里的南岗西部发见的圹砖处向南北开掘（即一号墓），发见主室及前后室。同时在它的东边也试行开掘，又发见了一处墓葬，有前室后室和两侧室
    （即二号墓）。综计全部发掘的东西，有铜镜、汉五铢、新货泉、残铁、琉璃耳瑱、陶器、明器等。从古物的形象观察，更证以出土的货币，可断定这两个墓葬是新莽（公元九年至二十三年）或东汉
    （公元二十五至二百二十年）的遗迹。在首都的北郊，今年四月在清河镇西北二里的地方发见汉代墓葬一处。汉墓的西面，清河大楼的东南，同时也发见古墓，该墓的发掘在今年六月间开始。完毕以后，又发掘了它近旁的清雍正六年蔚州知州杨实显张氏墓。同时还发掘了朱房村北某砖厂附近的瓦棺群和汉朝居住址。清河大楼东南古墓的发掘中，发见头骨一具、骨骼一具（次序已紊乱，足证曾被盗掘过），又有很多的五铢和铜刀、匕首、书刀、铜镜（残）、银钏、蝉形玉琀、玉豚、陶俑、陶器、明器、残铁、漆棺和漆器残片。经过专家研究，断为汉代（公元前二百○六至公元二百二十年）的东西，也可能是西汉（公元前二百○六至公元二十五年）的古物。从出土的古物可以看到当时人民生活的情形，髹漆工业的发达，和营造的技巧。朱房村北半里多路地方，挖土时曾经发见灰土层，其中有不少的陶瓦残片、石臼、铁制工具，附近又发见了砖井四处，从形制上看，都是汉代的古物。它的北边又有陶井一处；在陶井的北面，有瓦棺群，在内发见有婴儿头骨。这里的发见品，也是先秦的（至晚不过汉代）古物。瓦棺出土地点的东边，发掘出两个仰身葬的尸体，其中一个尸体的耳部有“大泉五十”一枚，这可能是西汉平民埋葬的场所。
    以上北京近郊出土的文物，都陈列在北京历史博物馆。这些古物，说明了我们伟大祖国首都的文化，至少已有二千年的可靠的历史。
