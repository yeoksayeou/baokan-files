Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 5th: Our frontline reporter reports: The Korean people, who have been brutally massacred and had their property destroyed by the American armed aggressors and their accomplices, and the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army, who are fighting bravely to defend their homeland, have expressed extreme anger and resolute opposition to the unreasonable suggestions and demands put forward by the US side in the discussion of the third item on the armistice negotiation agenda.

    Old man Jin Huande, whose leg was broken by the butt of a gun by the American invading army, said angrily: "The reason why we must resolutely oppose the unreasonable suggestions and absurd demands of the American aggressors can be understood simply by looking at a debt of blood in our small town. More than a hundred houses in the town have been completely bombed and burned by the American devils. A small part of it was burned by the American devils after they crossed the 38th parallel last year after pouring gasoline on it, and most of it was bombed by American planes. The town originally had a population of more than three hundred people, but now there are only nearly two hundred people left. More than forty people were killed by American soldiers and the Syngman Rhee puppet army last year, more than ten young women were raped to death, and more than seventy elderly people, women, and children were killed by American planes. The peaceful people in most of the towns and villages in northern Korea have also suffered such inhuman massacres and destruction by the American devils."

    Another elderly man, Li Jingu, said firmly: "Numerous bloody facts tell us that under no circumstances can we allow the American aggressors to keep their barbaric troops on the islands behind us during the armistice period, and we absolutely cannot allow the United States to freely enter and leave all of Korea in the name of the armistice supervision team to interfere in the internal affairs of our Korean people. In order to prevent the American aggressors from carrying out indiscriminate bombing and armed aggression against our towns and villages again, and to ensure our post-war reconstruction work, the Korean people have the independent right to build and strengthen defenses on their own land, and this is absolutely not allowed to be interfered with by the American aggressors. We, the Korean people, fully support the seven reasonable proposals put forward by our delegation."

    Kim Ho-kwan, the leader of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, said: "The enemy proposed that they should continue to occupy the coastal islands of our northern part and restrict us from building airports on our own land during the war. The purpose of these demands of the American aggressors is to make our Korean people lose their power of self-defense, so that the United States can launch armed aggression again whenever it wants. But we, the Korean people, are by no means cowards. With the support of the great Chinese People's Volunteers, we will be able to continue to defeat any attacking enemy. We resolutely oppose such shameless suggestions and barbarian demands from the enemy."

    Li Guoxian, a soldier of a certain unit of the People's Army, said: "It can be seen from the discussion of the third item on the agenda that the enemy, like in the past when discussing the second item on the agenda, does not forget to invade our country for a moment. The unreasonable demands put forward by the enemy this time make us see this even more clearly. Now the enemy is delaying the negotiations again and continuing to direct his troops to attack us. We should continue to heighten our vigilance, shatter the conspiracies of the barbaric and cunning enemy, and resolutely strike at any enemy who dares to attack us."

    美方对第三项议程提出无理要求妄图干涉朝鲜内政
    朝鲜人民和人民军指战员表示极度愤怒
    【新华社朝鲜前线五日电】本社前线记者报道：受到美国武装侵略者及其帮凶者残酷屠杀和破坏的朝鲜人民和为保卫祖国而英勇战斗的朝鲜人民军的指挥员战斗员们，对美方在停战谈判第三项议程的讨论中所提出的无理建议和要求，表示极度的愤怒和坚决的反对。
    曾被美国侵略军用枪托打断了腿的老人金焕德愤怒地说：“我们所以要坚决反对美国侵略者的无理建议和荒谬要求，只要看一看我们小镇上的一笔血债就知道了。镇上的一百多间房子已经全部被美国鬼子炸毁和烧毁了。其中一小部分是去年美国鬼子越过三八线时浇上汽油烧掉的，大部分是美国飞机炸掉的。这个市镇原来有三百多人口，现在只剩下了近二百口人。去年被美国兵和李承晚伪军杀死的有四十几个，被他们强奸致死的青年妇女有十多个，被美国飞机炸死的老年人、妇女和儿童有七十多个。朝鲜北部的极大部分城镇和农村里的和平人民也都遭到了美国鬼子这种惨无人道的惨杀和破坏。”
    另一老年人李金谷坚决地说：“许许多多血的事实告诉我们，无论如何是不能允许美国侵略者在停战期间把他的野蛮部队保留在我们后方的岛屿上，也绝对不能允许美国借着停战监督小组的名义，自由出入全部朝鲜，来干涉我们的朝鲜人民的内政。为了防止美国侵略者再对我们城镇和乡村进行绝灭人性的轰炸和进行武装侵略，为了保障我们的战后恢复工作，朝鲜人民有在自己国土上修建和加强防御的自主权利，这也是绝对不允许美国侵略者来干涉的。我们朝鲜人民是完全拥护我们的代表团提出的七项合理建议的。”
    朝鲜人民军某部分队长金虎宽说：“敌人提出在作战期间仍要占领我国北部沿海岛屿和限制我们在自己国土上修建飞机场。美国侵略者这些要求的目的，是要使我们朝鲜人民失去自卫的力量，美国要什么时候再发动武装侵略，就在什么时候发动武装侵略。但是我们朝鲜人民决不是懦夫，在伟大的中国人民志愿军的支援下，我们是能够继续击败任何进攻的敌人的。我们是坚决反对敌人这种无耻建议和野蛮人的要求的。”
    人民军某部战士李国宪说：“从第三项议程的讨论中可以看出，敌人和在过去讨论第二项议程时一样，一刻也不忘记对我们国家的侵略。敌人这次提出的无理要求更使我们明白地看出这一点。现在敌人又在把谈判拖延下去，并且在继续指挥他的部队向我们进攻，我们应当继续提高警惕，粉碎野蛮而狡猾的敌人的阴谋诡计，坚决打击敢于向我们进攻的敌人。”
