[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to eliminate narcotics, improve the health of the people, enhance social productivity, and maintain social order, today (the 10th) issued a notice stipulating measures for strictly prohibiting opium and narcotics. In order to rapidly and effectively complete the work of prohibiting opium and narcotics, the Municipal People's Government and relevant units have formed the "Beijing Municipal Committee for the Prohibition of Opium and Narcotics," with Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu as the chairman, and Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau Dong Ruqin, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau Zhang Minghe, and Deputy Director of the Public Health Bureau Zhang Wenqi as vice-chairmen.

The full text of the notice from the Beijing Municipal People's Government is as follows:

It has been found that opium and narcotics – opium, morphine, cocaine, heroin, and similar poisonous substances and compounds – damage the health of the people and destroy social productivity, causing enormous harm. Since the liberation of this city, due to the increasing awareness of the people, most of those who manufactured, trafficked, sold, and smoked opium and narcotics have already changed their professions or quit; however, there are still a few unscrupulous elements who continue to secretly manufacture, traffic, sell, and smoke them. In order to implement the "Circular on Strictly Prohibiting Opium and Narcotics" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, it is hereby decided:

一、From the date of this notice, no one shall manufacture, traffic, or sell opium or other narcotics. Those who possess opium and narcotics and their manufacturing equipment shall immediately report and surrender them in their entirety to the local public security sub-bureau.

二、Those who smoke opium and narcotics must, from the date of this notice, immediately register at the local public security police station and quit within a prescribed period.

三、Hospitals, factories, schools, government agencies, etc., that possess narcotics specifically for medical or laboratory use must register with the local public security sub-bureau and await notification for handling.

Those who violate these regulations will be severely punished!
