Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Lê Đình Thám, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and head of the Vietnamese delegation to the Second World Peace Council, met with a Vietnam News Agency reporter stationed in Beijing on his way home from Vienna. Lê Đình Thám, in response to the questions raised, said: The Second World Peace Council has more closely linked the struggle of people all over the world for peace with the national liberation movement. The resolutions of this meeting on Vietnam and Southeast Asia, as well as the resolutions on the Near East and the Middle East, have strengthened the confidence of the oppressed people and enabled them to intensify the struggle for national independence and the defense of world peace.

Lê Đình Thám explained the Vietnamese delegation's attitude towards the Second World Peace Council's resolution on Vietnam and Southeast Asia, saying: When the Vietnamese representative explained at the meeting the attitude of the Vietnamese people towards defending world peace, condemned the crimes committed by the French colonialists and American interventionists in Vietnam, and described the enthusiasm of the Vietnamese people in engaging in a long-term resistance war and demanding independence and peace, the participating representatives stood up and cheered three times. We believe that the resolution of this meeting on Vietnam and Southeast Asia is an important resolution on the issue of peace in the Far East. Due to the adoption of this resolution, a peaceful solution to the Vietnam issue and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Vietnam will become the slogan of struggle for hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world. This fact greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people.

Lê Đình Thám finally stated: After returning home, the Vietnamese delegation will report in detail to the Vietnamese government and people on the Second World Peace Council and the situation of people all over the world striving for peace. They will also report on the powerful movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea, the great construction achievements of the Soviet Union, and the moving scenes of the Vietnamese representatives meeting with representatives from France and North Africa. The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace will formulate specific plans to widely disseminate the resolutions of the World Peace Council and strengthen the movement to sign the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact.

    黎廷探在京发表谈话
    认为关于越南和东南亚的决议
    加强了越南人民斗争的信心
    【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南保卫世界和平委员会主席、越南出席世界和平理事会第二次会议代表团团长黎廷探在由维也纳返国途经北京时，曾接见越南通讯社驻北京的记者。黎廷探答复他所提出的问题说：世界和平理事会第二次会议已把全世界人民争取和平的斗争和民族解放运动更紧密地结合起来。这次会议关于越南和东南亚的决议以及关于近东和中东的决议，加强了被压迫人民的信心，并使他们加紧争取民族独立和保卫世界和平的斗争。
    黎廷探说明越南代表团对于世界和平理事会第二次会议关于越南和东南亚的决议的态度说：当越南代表在会议中说明越南人民对于保卫世界和平的态度，谴责法国殖民者和美国干涉者在越南所制造的罪行，并叙述越南人民从事长期抗战和要求独立与和平的热情之后，与会代表曾起立欢呼三次。我们认为这次会议关于越南和东南亚的决议，是关于远东和平问题的重要决议。由于此项决议的通过，和平解决越南问题和所有外国军队撤离越南，就将成为全世界亿万爱好和平的人民的斗争口号。这个事实大大地鼓舞了越南人民。
    黎廷探最后表示：越南代表团回国后，将详尽地向越南政府和人民报告世界和平理事会第二次会议和全世界人民争取和平的情形。他们并将报告中国人民抗美援朝的强大运动，苏联的伟大建设成就，以及越南代表和法国、北非代表晤见时的动人情景。越南保卫世界和平委员会将拟订具体计划，广泛传达世界和平理事会的决议，并加强在要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名的运动。
