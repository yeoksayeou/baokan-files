Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th - TASS: The statement made in Paris by the US representative to the United Nations, Austin, states that a US military aircraft under the command of General Ridgway, on a "reconnaissance flight" over the Sea of Japan on November 6th of this year, did not return to base. The statement said that the aforementioned aircraft was attacked by Soviet fighter planes over international waters without warning.

In view of this statement by the US representative to the United Nations, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers it necessary to state the following:

On November 7th of this year, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Gromyko, handed a note to the US Chargé d'Affaires, Ko Ming. The content of the note is as follows:

"The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics considers it necessary to declare to the Government of the United States of America as follows:

"According to confirmed materials received by the Soviet government, at 10:10 AM Vladivostok time on November 6th of this year, a US twin-engine 'Neptune' bomber intruded into Soviet territory in the area of Cape Ostrovnoi.

"At that time, two Soviet fighter planes approached the American aircraft, intending to force the plane, which had already intruded into Soviet territory, to land at a Soviet airfield, but the American aircraft opened fire on them. Thereupon, the Soviet aircraft were compelled to return fire, after which the American aircraft turned and flew out to sea, disappearing from sight.

"The Soviet government hereby informs the US government of this matter, strongly protesting this further serious violation of the Soviet border by US military aircraft, firmly demanding strict punishment of those responsible for this intrusion, and hoping that the US government will immediately take appropriate measures to prevent future intrusions into Soviet territory by US aircraft."

To date, this note has not received a reply from the US government.

    就美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境事
    苏联外交部发表声明
    苏联政府曾照会美政府提出抗议
   【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀致安全理事会的声明已在巴黎发表，其中说，李奇微将军统率下的美国军用飞机一架于本年十一月六日在日本海上空作“侦察飞行”，没有返回基地。那个声明说，上述飞机在公海上空未接到警告就受到苏联战斗机的攻击。
    鉴于美国驻联合国代表的这个声明，苏联外交部认为必须声明如下：
    本年十一月七日，苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯把照会一件交给美国代办柯明。照会内容如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为必须向美利坚合众国政府声明如下：
    “根据苏联政府接获的已经证实的材料，本年十一月六日海参崴时间十时十分，美国双引擎‘海王星’式轰炸机一架在奥斯特洛夫诺伊角地区侵入苏联国境。
    “当时两架苏联战斗机即飞近该美国飞机，打算迫使这架已经侵入苏联国境的飞机在苏联飞机场降落，但美国飞机竟向它们开火。于是苏联飞机便不得不开火还击，此后美国飞机便掉头向海外飞去，消失了踪迹。
    “苏联政府特将此事通知美国政府，坚决抗议美国军用飞机又一次严重地侵犯苏联国境的行为，坚决要求严格处分应对此次侵犯事件负责的人员，并希望美国政府立即采取适当的措施，以防止美国飞机将来再侵犯苏联国境。”
    至今为止，这个照会仍未获得美国政府的答复。
