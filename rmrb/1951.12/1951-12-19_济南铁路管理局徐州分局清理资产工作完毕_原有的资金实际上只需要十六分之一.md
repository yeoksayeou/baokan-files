Jinan Railway Administration, Xuzhou Railway Branch, discovered severe waste of funds during its asset inventory and capital verification work. According to statistics, the total amount of funds cleared out this time was 30.669 billion yuan, while the total quota was only 1.9288 billion yuan, exceeding the quota by 28.741 billion yuan. In other words, the funds accumulated by this branch could supply nearly sixteen branches of the same size.

Some Materials Sufficient for Several Decades

Materials were the most heavily overstocked items among the funds. The actual stock of materials in some units exceeded the quota by 114 times; even the least exceeded the quota by more than six times. The rolling stock section originally had 4,623 kilograms of asphalt oil, exceeding the quota (5 kilograms) by 924 times, enough for seventy-seven years of use. According to statistics, this branch cleared out 47 types of surplus materials sufficient for more than five years of use, 27 types sufficient for more than ten years of use, and six types sufficient for more than twenty years of use.

Many "Small Warehouses" and Off-the-Books Materials

During this inventory, many "small warehouses" were discovered. The Xuzhou Engineering Section cleared out 4,574 bolts and 3,500 fishplates, worth nearly 110 million yuan. A repair team in the locomotive section cleared out 37 different types of milling cutters, enough to equip a repair team. The off-the-books materials cleared out this time amounted to 2.975 billion yuan, accounting for 9.7% of the total actual stock. In other words, 9.7% of the materials were not recorded in the books and could be used at will. This not only accumulated funds but also made the financial system very chaotic. Many unsuitable materials were also cleared out. The Xin'anzhen Engineering Section had 324 types of materials in stock, of which 193 types were unsuitable, accounting for 71.65% of the total value of the materials in stock. Because these unsuitable materials could not be used, they had been stored in the warehouse for a long time, resulting in a great waste.

The Reasons: Incorrect Planning and Departmentalism

The reasons for the accumulation and waste of funds are mainly incorrect production plans, financial plans, and departmentalism. When preparing plans, there were no correct material consumption standards, and they were only based on old experiences and habits. In addition, some cadres had the idea that "the bigger the plan, the better, as it is more convenient to use," so the plan was large and unrealistic. The supply units issued materials according to the budget proposed by the material-using units, neglecting the review work. The material-using units rushed to collect materials, believing that having more materials would "strengthen their courage." Because the materials purchased by the supply units were overstocked, they were afraid of affecting the turnover of funds, so they distributed them to various material-using units. As a result, a large amount of materials accumulated in the material-using units.

Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Strengthened the Overall Concept and Sense of Responsibility of Cadres and the Masses

The asset inventory and capital verification work of this branch began on August 15 and ended on November 13. After nearly three months of investigation and review, it is now over. Because the preparations for the asset inventory and capital verification work were relatively good in advance, education on the working class being the leading class of the country was carried out among the broad masses of workers, and a series of organizational work was done, the results were relatively large. Through this inventory, the departmentalism and supply system mentality of cadres in various departments have begun to be eliminated, the political awareness of cadres and workers has been improved, and the overall concept and sense of responsibility for protecting state assets have been strengthened. Many employees turned in some tools and materials that they had taken home from the factory during the Kuomintang rule. They believed that this was the only way to fulfill their responsibility as masters of the country. Some workers said: After this inventory, the tools and materials are all accounted for, and everyone should be responsible for them, and we must not be as careless and casual as in the past! The previously widespread "small warehouses" have now been basically eliminated. They have initially achieved that there are signs for materials, accounts for signs, and materials for accounts. The leading cadres of the branch have begun to have a clear idea of the situation, laying the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system.

    济南铁路管理局徐州分局清理资产工作完毕
    原有的资金实际上只需要十六分之一
    济南铁路管理局徐州铁路分局，在清理资产核定资金工作中，发现浪费资金的现象十分严重。据统计：这次清理出来的资金，总额是三百零六亿六千九百多万元；而定量总额只有十九亿二千八百余万元，超出定额二百八十七亿四千一百余万元。也就是说，这个分局积压的资金可以供给将近十六个同样的分局用。
    有些材料够用好几十年
    在资金中，材料积压得最多。有个别单位材料实存量比定量多一百一十四倍；最少的也比定量多六倍以上。车辆段原存沥青油四千六百二十三公斤，比定量（五公斤）多了九百二十四倍，足够七十七年之用。据统计：这个分局这次清查出的多余材料，足够五年以上用的有四十七种；足够十年以上用的有二十七种；足够二十年以上用的有六种。
    “小仓库”和账外物资很多
    在这次清查当中，发现“小仓库”很多。徐州工务段清查出螺拴四千五百七十四个，夹板三千五百块，价值将近一亿一千万元。机务段一个包修组，就清查出各式不同的错刀三十七把，足够配一个包修组之用。这次清查出的账外材料，就有二十九亿七千五百多万元，占实存量总额的百分之九点七；换句话说，就是有百分之九点七的材料不在账内，可以随便使用。这样不仅积压了资金，而且使财务制度非常紊乱。清查出来的不适用的材料也很多。新安镇工务段库存材料三百二十四种，其中就有一百九十三种是不适用的，价额占库存材料总额的百分之七十一点六五。这些不适用的材料，因为没法使用，久在库内存放，成为极大的浪费。
    原因是计划不正确和本位主义作怪
    资金积压和浪费的原因，主要是生产计划财务计划不正确和本位主义思想作祟。在编造计划时，没有正确的材料消耗标准，只根据旧的经验和习惯办事；加上某些干部有“编的愈大愈好，使用时候方便”的思想，所以，计划庞大不切合实际。供应单位根据用料单位所提预算照发，忽视审核工作。用料单位抢着领料，认为料多可以“壮胆”。供应单位因为购来的材料积压过多，惟恐影响资金周转，所以就派发给各用料单位。因此，用料单位的材料就大批积压起来。
    经过清理资产核定资金加强了干部和群众的整体观念和责任心
    这个分局的清理资产核定资金工作，从八月十五日开始，到十一月十三日止，经过近三个月的清查和复查，现在已经结束。因为事先对清理资产核定资金工作的准备较好，在广大职工中进行了工人阶级是国家的领导阶级的教育，并且做了一系列的组织工作，所以收效较大。通过这次清查，已开始消除各部门干部的本位主义和供给制思想，提高了干部和工人群众的政治觉悟，加强了整体观念和爱护国家资产的责任心。许多职工把多年埋藏的国民党统治时代从工厂中拿回家去的一些工具、材料缴了出来。他们认为只有这样才算是尽了国家主人翁的责任。有的工人说：经过这次清查，工具和材料都有数啦，各人都应该好好地负责，可不能像过去那样马虎随便啦！从前普遍存在的“小仓库”，现在已基本上取消了。他们已经初步做到了有料就有牌、有牌就有账、有账就有料。分局领导干部开始作到了心中有数，为实行经济核算制打下了基础。
