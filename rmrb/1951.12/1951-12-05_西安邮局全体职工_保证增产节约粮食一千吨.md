    Xi'an Post Office Employees Guarantee to Increase Production and Conserve 1,000 Tons of Grain
    In response to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and conservation, all employees of the Xi'an Post Office are committed to increasing production and conserving 1,000 tons of millet for the state by the end of the year. At the mobilization meeting on November 18th, Wang Jing and Duan Wenyou's groups from the Business Section took the lead in issuing a challenge. In terms of increasing production, they guaranteed to organize mobile service teams to go out and develop business every Sunday; in terms of conservation, they guaranteed to make full use of waste paper to make envelopes and save electricity. Zhang Xiwu's advanced group also put forward specific conditions to challenge the various groups in the Business Section. The Ordinary Mail Group is currently brewing plans to use their rest time, in coordination with the Distribution Section, to promote books and periodicals in every corner of the city, solicit newspaper subscriptions, and strive to obtain the Red Banner of Excellence. Employees of other groups are also racking their brains to come up with many conservation methods. Now, this increase production and conservation movement has been deeply unfolded in the bureau, and every employee regards the completion of the established task as the biggest thing every day.

    西安邮局全体职工
    保证增产节约粮食一千吨
    西安邮局全体职工为了响应毛主席的增产节约的号召，保证至年底要为国家增产节约小米一千吨。在十一月十八日的动员大会上，营业股王荆、段文友两小组首先带头提出挑战，在增产方面，他们保证每星期日组织流动服务组出外发展业务；在节约方面，保证尽量利用废纸糊制信封以及节省用电。张锡五先进小组也提出具体条件向营业股各小组应战。平邮组在会后正酝酿着利用休息时间，配合发行股到本市各个角落推销书刊，揽订报纸，争取得到优胜红旗。其他各小组职工也都在开动脑筋，想出很多节约办法。现在，这个增产节约运动已在该局深入展开，每个职工都把完成既定任务，看为每天最大的事情。    何修  董昌达
