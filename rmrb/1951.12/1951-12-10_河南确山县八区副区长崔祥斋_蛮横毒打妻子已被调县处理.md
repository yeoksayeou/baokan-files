    Cui Xiangzhai, Deputy Head of the Eighth District of Queshan County, Henan Province,
    Barbarously Beat His Wife and Has Been Transferred to the County for Handling
    Cui Xiangzhai, Deputy Head of the Eighth District of Queshan County, Henan Province, and a Communist Party member, discriminated against women and beat his wife. He has been transferred to the county people's government for handling. On October 29th of this year, Cui Xiangzhai went to participate in the democratic reform work in Ren Dian Town. When he walked to the entrance of the cooperative in Ren Dian Town, he saw his wife talking to a male cadre from the cooperative (his wife works in the cooperative). He became furious, ordered his wife to kneel down, and beat her severely. Comrades from the cooperative tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. Later, he dragged his wife to the street and beat her. When the masses tried to pull them apart, Cui Xiangzhai said barbarously and unreasonably: "No one is allowed to interfere. Women are like 'broken carts,' they need to be beaten!" He beat her six times in a row. The masses reflected, "The government promotes the Marriage Law every day, prohibiting the abuse of women, but the district head still beats his wife. What is this!" Cui Xiangzhai is a Communist Party member and the deputy head of the people's government, yet he does not abide by state laws and regulations, disregards the Party's influence, discriminates against women, and beats his wife. This is intolerable. The Queshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Queshan County People's Government have transferred Cui Xiangzhai to the county for handling. Duan Shiyu

    河南确山县八区副区长崔祥斋
    蛮横毒打妻子已被调县处理
    河南省确山县第八区副区长、共产党员崔祥斋歧视妇女，毒打妻子，已被调到县人民政府处理。今年十月二十九日，崔祥斋去参加任店镇的民主改革工作。当他走到任店镇合作社门口时，看到他的妻子和合作社的一个男干部在谈话（他妻子在合作社工作），他就大发雷霆，叫他妻子跪下，并毒打她。合作社的同志加以劝阻，也没有结果。后来他又把他妻子拉到大街上打，群众去拉架时，崔祥斋蛮横无理地说：“谁也不许拉，女人就是‘属破车’的，不打不行！”就这样一连打了六次。群众反映说：“政府天天宣传婚姻法，不叫虐待妇女，可是区长还打老婆，这算什么！”崔祥斋是个共产党员，又是人民政府的副区长，竟不遵守国家法纪，不顾党的影响，歧视妇女，毒打妻子，这是不能容许的。中共确山县委员会和确山县人民政府已把崔祥斋调到县里处理。段世宇
