    British People Oppose the War in Malaya
    The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party recently issued a statement on the situation in Malaya, expressing its support for the Malayan people's struggle for independence and freedom, and demanding that the British government end the Malayan war. This statement by the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party is entirely in line with the interests and aspirations of the British and Malayan people.
    The evil war waged by the British government in Malaya, in order to continue to plunder and oppress the Malayan people and for British capitalists to continue to extract excess profits, is of no benefit to the British people. On the contrary, it has brought even deeper disasters to the British people. Countless British soldiers have needlessly lost their lives in the colonial war in Malaya. At the same time, the huge military expenditure spent by the British government each year to suppress the Malayan people has continuously increased the tax burden on the British working people, causing their already low living standards to continue to decline. The British ruling clique is accustomed to shamelessly shouting about "defending British interests in Malaya," but everyone knows that the real interests of the British people lie in resolutely stopping the war of plunder in Malaya and establishing peaceful and friendly relations with a free Malaya.
    The British Conservative government has apparently not learned a lesson from the failures suffered by the Labour government in Malaya over the past three years, and wants to continue to intensify its offensive against the Malayan people. The statement recently made by the British Colonial Secretary Lyttelton before leaving Singapore fully proves this point. However, Lyttelton's so-called "six-point plan" will likewise certainly not be able to save British imperialism's dire situation in Malaya. We believe that the heroic Malayan people will use their more resolute struggle to counterattack the new aggressive conspiracies of British imperialism and continue to inflict shameful defeats upon it.

    英国人民反对在马来亚的战争
    英国共产党执行委员会最近就马来亚局势发表声明，表示支持马来亚人民争取独立自由的斗争，并要求英国政府结束马来亚战争。英国共产党执行委员会的这一声明是完全符合于英国人民和马来亚人民的利益和愿望的。
    英国政府在马来亚所进行的罪恶战争，是为了继续掠夺和压迫马来亚人民，为英国的大资本家继续榨取超额的利润，对于英国人民是没任何好处的，相反的却为英国人民带来了更为深重的灾难。无数的英国士兵已在马来亚的殖民战争中白白地送了性命，同时英国政府每年为镇压马来亚人民而支出的巨额军费，则又不断地加重了英国劳动人民的赋税负担，使他们已经很低的生活水平继续下降。英国统治集团惯于无耻地叫喊要“保卫英国在马来亚的利益”，但是谁都知道，英国人民的真正利益是坚决地制止掠夺马来亚的战争，并与自由的马来亚建立和平友好的关系。
    英国保守党政府显然还没有从工党政府三年多来在马来亚所遭受的失败中取得教训，而要继续加紧对马来亚人民的进攻。英国政府的殖民大臣里特尔顿最近在离新加坡前所发表的声明，就充分证明了这一点。但是，里特尔顿的所谓“六点办法”，同样也一定不能挽救英帝国主义在马来亚的恶劣处境。我们相信，英勇的马来亚人民一定会用他们更加坚决的斗争来反击英帝国主义的新的侵略阴谋，并使它继续遭受到可耻的失败。
