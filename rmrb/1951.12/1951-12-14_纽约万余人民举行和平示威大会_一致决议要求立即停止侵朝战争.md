In the spirit of Christmas, please arrange a ceasefire and stop the shooting immediately. We want our dear sons, husbands, and brothers to return and celebrate the New Year with us and their families. Ordinary people all over the world, like us, and heads of governments are already suggesting a conference of major powers to prevent further bloodshed and negotiate peace. I urge you to arrange such a meeting in order to offer peace guarantees and ensure that all differences are resolved peacefully. May 1952 be a year in which we and our children can attain world peace."
