Mobilize and Fulfill the Glorious Task of the Second Phase of Huai River Harnessing!
Zhou Pu

The second phase of the Huai River harnessing project began in full swing on November 20th.

The main achievements of the first phase of the project were the construction of the main dikes of the main streams and tributaries, the construction of some reservoirs and lake depression storage projects, and the dredging of tributaries and ditch projects in some areas. Therefore, the threat of huge floods was initially eliminated, and the problem of waterlogging in some areas was solved. The goal of the second phase of the project is to build more reservoirs and lake storage projects on this basis to further reduce flood peaks, to carry out large-scale tributary dredging and consolidation projects to solve the problem of waterlogging in most areas; and at the same time to start irrigation projects in the middle and lower reaches to lay the foundation for preventing drought.

Compared with the first phase of the project, the second phase has the following characteristics: First, the scale of the project is larger than the first phase. The total amount of earthwork is estimated to be 400 million cubic meters, which is about twice as large as the first phase. The projects with more difficult conditions and more complex technologies are larger and more numerous than the first phase. Two larger reservoirs are to be completed, three larger reservoirs are to be started, and the project of diverting internal and external water is to be started, separating some tributaries below Zhengyangguan from the Huai River and flowing directly into Hongze Lake. Secondly, there are more difficulties in the organization and mobilization of migrant workers than in the first phase. Last year, in most areas of the Huai River Basin, land reform was postponed in order to give priority to harnessing the Huai River. The land reform in these areas must be completed this winter. The simultaneous progress of two huge tasks will cause certain difficulties in the allocation of cadres and mass forces. However, if more work cannot be completed in the winter and most of the project is left to be carried out in the spring, it will conflict with spring agricultural production.

How can we accomplish this huge historical task?

First, we must conscientiously do a good job in propaganda, mobilization, and organization. Relying on the masses is the only guarantee for completing the task of harnessing the Huai River. Therefore, we must do a good job in propaganda, mobilization, and organization of the masses. After the completion of the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project, the masses have felt the direct benefits. Therefore, the masses' understanding of the Huai River harnessing has been improved; in the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project, both cadres and the masses have gained a lot of experience; these are all favorable conditions for the second phase of the Huai River harnessing project. However, we must never think that the future work will be smooth sailing. We must estimate the various ideological situations that may arise among the masses and study solutions in advance. For example, this year the Huai River Basin has generally had a bumper harvest, and some of the masses may become paralyzed, thinking that the Huai River has been repaired, and therefore only care about their own production and are unwilling to work on the project again. Due to the simultaneous progress of land reform and Huai River harnessing, some of the masses may be worried about the quality of the land they should be allocated, and are willing to participate in land reform but not in the Huai River harnessing project. As for the contradiction between Huai River harnessing and agricultural production, it is even more necessary to solve it. In response to these possible situations, we must pay close attention to the ideological situation of the masses before and after the start of construction, and conduct in-depth publicity at any time; at the same time, we must carry out huge organizational work and earnestly solve the actual difficulties felt by the masses. The leading organs in various places must, according to the actual situation, unify leadership, appropriately allocate forces, and completely do a good job in these three tasks of land reform, Huai River harnessing, and agricultural production in a planned way. The masses who are working on the project should be educated to do the project well and ensure everyone's safety; the masses at home should be educated to take good care of the masses working on the project in the allocation of land and spring plowing production, so that the masses working on the project can work with peace of mind.

Second, we must strengthen the planning of our work. The first phase of the project was carried out after a huge flood occurred in the Huai River Basin, and it was necessary to immediately eliminate the threat of severe floods. Therefore, all the work was carried out with extreme haste and passivity. This was unavoidable at the time. It is precisely because we completed the unprecedentedly huge project in a short period of time that we were able to obtain the general bumper harvest of agricultural products in the Huai River Basin in 1951. Although the second phase of the project is even larger than the first phase, in terms of survey, measurement, and construction preparation, we have more time than the first phase, so it is possible to make all work more planned. For example, the allocation of funds and food, the ordering and transportation of engineering materials, the organization and use of transportation forces, and the arrangement of migrant workers' living and health work, etc., if they can be done in a more orderly and planned way, they can improve efficiency, save manpower, and reduce waste, both for the Huai River harnessing itself and for all production and transportation departments related to the Huai River harnessing. The most important of these is the project itself. In the first phase of the project, the leading organs at all levels generally adopted a cautious and meticulous attitude towards various engineering designs. Each project was studied in detail. However, individual shortcomings still existed. For example, in the Huai River dredging project, due to insufficient research on flow, water level, riverbed cross-section, and terrain conditions, the key was not grasped. Therefore, the main stream dredging project in the Zhengyangguan section lacked a clear role. Another example is the Laowangpo depression storage project in the upstream flood storage project. Due to the carelessness and irresponsibility of the designers, about 20,000 mu of farmers' land was flooded before the time for water release. Therefore, in the second phase of the project, all cadres should be more careful and responsible, eliminate all the shortcomings of plans that are divorced from reality and blind construction without mature plans, so that each project has a clear benefit, and achieve the most economical and frugal under the condition of ensuring safety. For projects with higher technical requirements, construction should absolutely not be carried out if the plan is not mature. In all projects, the leading organs should pay more attention to leading the most critical projects; within a specific project, the leaders should pay more attention to leading the most critical parts. Because not making mistakes in the main project or in the main part of a project can ensure that the entire project basically does not make mistakes.

Third, summarize and promote the experience of the first phase of the project, and further improve work efficiency. The task of the Huai River harnessing project is large, the time is short, and the mobilization of the masses is subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, the main key to completing the task is to further improve work efficiency. According to the experience of the first phase of the project and the experience of water conservancy projects in other regions, we should affirm our understanding that improving work efficiency is entirely possible. In terms of earthwork, the average efficiency of the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project and the national water conservancy projects in 1951 was about two cubic meters of digging and transporting earth per person per day; however, there were several outstanding areas in the country in 1951, where the average efficiency far exceeded this standard. In North China, the migrant workers in Pingyuan Province repairing the Yellow River created a record of an average of four cubic meters of digging and transporting earth per person per day. In East China, the average efficiency of migrant workers in Guanyun County, Northern Jiangsu, in the Daoyi Project reached 3.99 cubic meters. On the Huai River, there were also individual units that reached the same high standard. According to the on-site calculation of the leading organs of the Daoyi Project, each cubic meter of earth weighs about 3,150 catties, which can be loaded into 14 to 18 small carts. The soil transportation distance is calculated at 120 meters, and each cart takes four minutes for a round trip, and each cart takes one minute to dig the soil. Each migrant worker works nine hours a day, and after one and a half hours of rest, the actual working time is seven and a half hours, which is 450 minutes in total, and a total of 90 carts of soil can be pushed, which is equivalent to five cubic meters. Therefore, even if the conditions of difficult work and insufficient labor are taken into account, it is entirely possible to increase the average efficiency of general earthwork to more than three cubic meters. What will happen if the earthwork efficiency in the entire Huai River harnessing project is increased from two cubic meters to three cubic meters? Taking 400 million cubic meters of earthwork as an example, the original 200 million man-days of work can be reduced to more than 130 million man-days, in other words, it can reduce 70 million people's one working day. This is a huge change. We must affirm this possible change and use all methods to move towards this goal. In the water conservancy projects in the two years since the founding of New China, many fairly mature experiences have been created in terms of earthwork. For example: implementing the method of free combination of migrant workers, scoring and recording work, and implementing the wage policy of "more work, more pay" to stimulate the enthusiasm of migrant workers. In terms of tools, we check the tools before starting work so that everyone's tools can be used smoothly. In terms of soil transportation methods, under normal circumstances, carrying soil is better than lifting soil, and handcarts are better than carrying baskets. Before starting work, we must first test the soil quality and repair the soil transportation roads. Dredging projects should unify the digging of drainage ditches. Such experiences are available everywhere. We must pay attention to this experience and summarize and promote this experience in order to strive for a general improvement in average work efficiency. As for the engineering aspects of using machinery, because we have insufficient experience, especially the cadres and technicians who manage machinery in the water conservancy department are relatively lacking, there are still more shortcomings. That is to say, there is still a greater possibility to improve mechanical efficiency. How to summarize and promote the existing experience, and how to create more experience, is a glorious mission for all our cadres and migrant workers.

The Huai River harnessing project is the first huge water conservancy project in New China. Every cadre and mass who participates in the Huai River harnessing should regard winning the victory of this project as their greatest glory. At the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao put forward the call to increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers. The cadres and masses who participate in the Huai River harnessing should first respond to this call, and on the basis of the first phase of the project, under the call of increasing production and practicing economy, strive to move forward and create greater and more brilliant achievements.

    动员起来，完成第二期治淮的光荣任务！
    周朴
    根治淮河的第二期工程，从十一月二十日起，就全面开工了。
    第一期工程的主要成就，是修筑了干支流的主要堤防，兴建了一部分水库和湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，并在部分地区，进行了支流疏浚和沟洫工程，因此，初步地解除了巨大洪水的威胁，并解决了部分地区的内涝问题。第二期工程的目标，是在这个基础上，修建更多的水库和湖泊蓄洪工程，以进一步削减洪水峰，大规模举办支流疏浚整理工程，以解决大部地区的内涝问题；同时在中下游开始兴办灌溉工程，为防止旱灾，建立基础。
    第二期工程和第一期工程相比，具有以下的特点：首先是工程的规模比第一期更为巨大。土工总量约计四亿立方公尺，比第一期工程约大一倍。条件较为困难和技术较为复杂的工程，比第一期工程更大更多，要完成两个较大的水库，开始兴建三个更大的水库，要开始兴办内外水分流的工程，使正阳关以下的一些支流，和淮河分开，直接流入洪泽湖。其次，在民工的组织动员上，比第一期工程存在着更多的困难。去年淮河流域的多数地区，因为尽先治淮，推迟了土地改革。这些地区的土地改革，都要在今年冬季进行完成。两个巨大的工作同时进行，在干部和群众力量的分配上，就发生了一定的困难。但是，如果不能在冬季完成较多工作，而把大部工程留待明年春季进行，又要和春季的农业生产发生矛盾。
    怎样才能完成这个巨大的历史任务呢？
    第一，要认真做好宣传动员和组织工作。依靠群众是完成治淮任务的唯一保证，因此，必须做好对群众的宣传动员和组织工作。第一期治淮工程完成后，群众已感受到直接的利益，因此，群众对治淮的认识，已经提高；在第一期治淮工程中，干部和群众都已获得很多经验；这都是第二期治淮工程的有利条件。但是，我们绝不能认为今后的工作就会一帆风顺，我们必须估计群众中可能产生的各种思想情况，预先研究解决的办法。比如，今年淮河流域普遍丰收，可能有部分的群众会发生麻痹情绪，认为淮河已经修好，因而只顾自己生产，不愿再作工程。由于土地改革和治淮同时进行，部分群众可能顾虑自己应分的田地的好坏，愿意参加土地改革，不愿参加治淮工程。至于治淮与农业生产的矛盾，更是必须解决的问题。针对这些可能发生的情况，我们必须在开工前后，密切注意群众的思想情况，随时进行深入的宣传；同时必须进行巨大的组织工作，切实解决群众所感到的实际困难。各地领导机关，必须根据实际情况，统一领导，适当配备力量，有计划地把土地改革、治淮和农业生产这三项工作完全做好。应该教育出工的群众，把工程切实作好，使大家的安全得到保障；教育在家的群众，在分配土地和春耕生产上，切实照顾出工的群众，使出工的群众能够安心工作。
    第二，要加强工作的计划性。第一期工程，是在淮河流域发生巨大水灾之后，是在必须立即免除严重洪水威胁的情况下进行的，所以全部工作带着极大的仓促性被动性。这在当时是不可避免的。正因为在短促的时间内完成了空前巨大的工程，我们才能得到了淮河流域一九五一年农产的普遍丰收。第二期工程虽然比第一期工程更为巨大，但就查勘、测量、施工准备各方面说来，已经有了比较第一期工程远为充裕的时间，因此也就有可能使一切工作获得更大的计划性。比如资金与食粮的调配，工程器材的订购调运，运输力量的组织使用，以及民工生活与卫生工作的布置等，若能做得更有条理、更有计划，无论对治淮本身来说，或者对与治淮有关的一切生产运输部门来说，都能够提高效率，节省人力，减少浪费。其中最重要的还是工程本身。在第一期工程中，各级领导机关，对于各种工程设计，一般是采取了谨慎细密的态度。每件工程都经过详细研究。但是，个别的缺点还是存在的。比如淮河疏浚工程，因为对流量、水位、河床断面及地形条件研究不足，未能掌握关键，所以正阳关段的干流疏浚工程，就缺乏明确的作用。又如上游蓄洪工程中的老王坡洼地蓄洪，由于设计人员的粗枝大叶、不负责任，还未到放水的时间，就淹没了农民二万亩左右的土地。因此，在第二期工程当中，所有干部，应该更细心，更负责，消灭一切计划脱离实际，以及计划不成熟就盲目施工的缺点，使每个工程都有明确的效益，并且在保证安全的条件下，做到最经济、最节约。技术性较高的工程，计划若不成熟，绝对不应施工。在全部工程中，领导机关要更多地注意领导最有关键性质的工程；在一个具体工程里面，领导人员要更多地注意领导最有关键性质的部分。因为在主要的工程上，或者在一个工程的主要部分上不犯错误，就能保证全部工程基本上不犯错误。
    第三、总结并推广第一期工程的经验，进一步提高工作效率。治淮工程任务大，时间短，动员群众又受着一定条件的限制，因此，完成任务的主要关键，是进一步提高工作效率。根据第一期工程的经验，和其他地区水利工程的经验，应该肯定认识，提高工作效率是完全可能的。就土工来说，第一期治淮工程和一九五一年全国水利工程的平均效率，是每人每日挖土运土两立方公尺左右；可是一九五
    一年全国有几个突出的地区，平均效率远超过这个标准。在华北，平原省修治黄河的民工，创造了每人每日挖土运土平均四立方公尺的纪录。在华东，苏北灌云县民工在导沂工程中，平均效率达到三点九九立方公尺。在淮河上，也有个别单位达到同样高的标准。根据导沂工程领导机关的实地计算，每立方公尺土，约重三一五○市斤，可装十四至十八小车，运土距离按一二○公尺计算，每车往返用四分钟，每车挖土用一分钟，每个民工每天工作九小时，除去一小时半休息，实做工七小时半，合四百五十分钟，总共可推土九十车，合五立方公尺。因此，即便把难工和劳力不齐等条件计算进去，把一般土工的平均效率提高到三立方公尺以上，是完全可以作到的。如果能够在全部治淮工程中，把土工效率从二立方公尺提高到三立方公尺，将会发生什么效果呢。以四亿立方公尺土工计算，原来需做二亿工日，就可减少到一亿三千余万工日，换句话说，就是可以减少七千万人的一个工作日。这是一个何等巨大的变化。我们必须肯定这个可能的变化，用一切方法，向这个目标努力迈进。在新中国两年以来的水利工程中，在土工方面，已经创造了许多相当成熟的经验。例如：实行民工自由组合、评分记工的办法，贯彻“多做多得”，激发民工工作热情的工资政策。在工具方面，实行到工以前检查工具，使每人的工具都能得心应手。运土方法，在一般情况下，挑土优于抬土，手推车又优于挑筐。开工以前，先要试验土质，修好运土的道路。疏浚工程要统一挖好排水的沟道。这类经验，各地都有。我们必须重视这种经验，并总结推广这种经验，以争取平均工作效率的普遍提高。至于使用机械的工程方面，因为我们经验不足，特别是水利部门管理机械的干部和技工比较缺乏，因此，还存在着较多的缺点。也就是说，提高机械效率，还存在着更大的可能。怎样总结推广已有的经验，怎样创造更多的经验，是我全体干部、民工一个光荣的使命。
    治淮工程是新中国第一个巨大的水利工程。参加治淮的每个干部、群众，就应该把赢得这个工程的胜利，引为自己的最大的光荣。在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上，毛主席提出了增加生产，厉行节约，支持中国人民志愿军的号召。参加治淮的干部和群众，应当首先响应这个号召，在第一期工程的基础上，在增产节约的号召下，努力迈进，以创造更巨大更光辉的成就。（附图片）
