    Beijing Film Studio Accepts Criticism
    Punishes Chen Zhining, and Decides to Transfer Purchased House to the Liquidation Bureau

    To the Editor: The opinion in the "Letters from Readers" on the November 25th People's Daily and the People's Daily's criticism of our studio are completely correct. This incident shows that the leading cadres of our studio have a bureaucratic work style. Our studio usually does not provide enough education to cadres, and lacks timely inspection of some work, resulting in cadres violating government laws and regulations, and creating a bad impression of our studio among the masses.

    When the problem occurred, after the People's Daily sent people to investigate, our studio immediately conducted an inspection by the Secretary-General, Deputy Director of the Management Office, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch, and Head of the General Affairs Section, and first made a self-criticism. In addition to focusing on reviewing this mistake, the General Affairs Section conducted a comprehensive ideological review of external relations, especially the mass viewpoint, and carried out strict criticism and education of Comrade Chen Zhining. Our studio immediately decided to transfer the house at No. 48, Beida Street, Xinjiekou to the Liquidation Bureau.

    Our studio has given the following punishments to the personnel involved in this incident:

    1.  Comrade Chen Zhining violated policies, infringed on the interests of the masses, dismantled water and electricity and toilets for tenants, and threatened the masses to move. In addition to requiring him to publicly review his mistakes in the newspaper, our studio will also give him a major demerit.

    2.  Comrade Wang Zhi, Head of the General Affairs Section, also had wrong ideas in handling housing and other issues, which had a great impact on the thinking of cadres in the section. After this incident occurred, although he tried to solve it, he did not immediately report it to the higher authorities, and he lacked inspection, which led to delays and adverse consequences. Our studio decided to give Comrade Wang Zhi a major demerit.

    3.  Comrade Peng Hourong, Secretary-General and Director of the Management Office, and Comrade Liu Jiezhi, Deputy Director, although they corrected the incident in a timely manner and apologized to the masses, allowing residents to use water, electricity, and toilets again, they lacked ideological education for cadres on a regular basis, and lacked prior inspection of this incident. Our studio decided to give them a criticism.

                                                                                                   Beijing Film Studio

    Chen Zhining's Self-Criticism

    I am willing to humbly accept the criticism from the masses and the People's Daily. I should be personally responsible for the full responsibility of forcing tenants to move. When I started buying the house at No. 48, Beida Street, Xinjiekou, I did not pay good attention to the issue of tenants moving, thinking that this was a matter between the landlord and the tenants. I ignored the government's relationship with the masses and held the simple view of completing the task, and did not pay enough attention to the interests of the masses in my thinking.

    After the government announced the decision to resolve housing issues, not only did I not immediately stop the house purchase work to await instructions from higher authorities, but I intensified it, which shows that I did not have a deep understanding of the government's policies. I thought that our studio's house purchase was approved on August 21st and was not within the September 1st regulation; I also misunderstood the third article of the municipal government's decision on special handling, which led to the development of errors, replacing the electric meter, dismantling the water pump and toilets, and consciously threatening tenants to move as soon as possible. This behavior violates the government's decision, and I am willing to make a deep review.

    The above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and behaviors are the toxins left to me by the old society. I am willing to apologize to the masses, request strict punishment from the organization, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

### 北京电影制片厂接受批评  处分陈治宁，并决定将所购房屋移交清管局

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京电影制片厂接受批评
    处分陈治宁，并决定将所购房屋移交清管局
    编辑同志：十一月二十五日人民日报“读者来信”的意见及人民日报对我厂的批评是完全正确的。这件事说明我厂领导干部有官僚主义作风。我厂平时对干部教育不够，对有些工作又缺少及时的检查，以致造成干部违反政府法令的错误，造成群众对我厂的不良印象。
    当问题发生，人民日报派人来调查后，我厂立即由秘书长、管理处副处长、中国共产党支部书记、总务科长进行检查，并首先作了自我检讨。总务科除着重地检讨这一错误外，并进行全面对外关系尤其是群众观点的思想检查，对陈治宁同志展开严格的批评教育。我厂并立即决定将新街口北大街四十八号房移交清管局。
    我厂对这一事件的有关人员给了以下的处分：
    一、陈治宁同志违反政策，侵害群众利益，拆除房客水电、厕所，威胁群众搬家，我厂除要他在报上公开检讨错误外，并给他记一大过。
    二、总务科长王峙同志对处理房屋等问题，平时亦有错误思想存在，对科内干部思想影响甚大。这
    一事件发生后，他虽曾设法解决，但没有立即向上级报告，自己又缺少检查，以致拖延，造成不良后果。我厂决定给王峙同志记一大过。
    三、秘书长兼管理处长彭后嵘同志、副处长刘介之同志，在这一事件发生后虽及时予以纠正，并向群众道歉，重新让住户使用水电及厕所，但平时对干部缺少思想教育，对这一事件事先又缺少检查，我厂决定给他以批评。        北京电影制片厂
    陈治宁的检讨
    我愿虚心接受群众和人民日报对我的批评。强迫房客搬家的全部责任应由我个人负责。我在开始买新街口北大街四十八号房子时，就没很好注意房客搬家问题，认为这是房东与房客的事情。我忽略了政府对群众的关系，抱着单纯完成任务的观点，对群众利益在思想上不够重视。
    在政府公布解决房屋问题的决定后，我不但没有立刻停止购房工作听候上级处理，相反的还加紧进行，这说明我对政府的政策理解不够深刻。我以为我厂购房是八月二十一日就被批准的，不在九月一日规定之内；又误解了市人民政府决定中关于特殊处理第三条的规定，以致造成错误的发展，将电表更换、压水机、厕所拆除，有意识地威胁房客早日搬家。这种行为是违反政府决定的，我愿作深刻检讨。
    上述错误思想和行为是旧社会给我的遗毒，我愿向群众道歉，请求组织严格处分，并保证今后不再发生类似事情。
