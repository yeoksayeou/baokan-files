    Li Wentou Infringes on Women's Rights
    Submits Self-Criticism to Beijing People's Court
    The case of Yu Wen, personnel section cadre of the Dongjiao Health Clinic in Beijing, Li Wentou, chairman of the labor union, and Lu Jingdai, director of the clinic, infringing upon human rights has already been sentenced by the Beijing People's Court on the 17th of last month. The Beijing People's Court ordered Li Wentou to publish a self-criticism in the newspaper. Li Wentou complied with the judgment and submitted a copy of his self-criticism to the Beijing People's Court on the 21st of last month.
    In his self-criticism, Li Wentou first admitted that the illegal detention of midwives Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi was an infringement on personal freedom and a violation of the Common Program. He admitted that although the Beijing People's Court did not impose criminal sanctions on him, the mistakes he committed were undeniable.
    In his self-criticism, Li Wentou said that due to his feudal thinking, he considered the interactions between Ma Jingcheng, Wang Lizhi, and Li Huajie to be an improper relationship between men and women, and even participated without principle in the "self-criticism meeting" presided over by Yu Wen, which interfered with the freedom of Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi. At the meeting, he not only failed to correct Yu Wen's erroneous behavior of infringing upon the freedom of Ma Jingcheng and others, but instead encouraged her erroneous behavior. When Yu Wen suspended Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi from their work and infringed upon their personal freedom, he failed to stand firmly on the position of the labor union to protect the legitimate rights of its members. Regarding the revocation of Ma Jingcheng's qualifications as a representative of the district democratic women's federation, although he did not participate in any comments, when Yu Wen instigated female comrades to re-elect women's representatives, he did not actively object, thereby encouraging the erroneous behavior of infringing upon Ma Jingcheng's political rights.
    Li Wentou concluded in his self-criticism that although the government had leniently handled him this time and did not impose criminal sanctions on him, he felt that his mistakes were serious. In addition to publishing a self-criticism in the newspaper, he also requested punishment from the Health Bureau and the District Labor Union Office.

    李文斗侵犯妇女人权
    向北京人民法院呈交检讨书
    北京市东郊卫生所人事科干事郁文、工会主席李文斗、所长鲁景岱等侵犯人权一案，已由北京市人民法院于上月十七日宣判。北京市人民法院判令李文斗登报检讨。李文斗遵判于上月二十一日将检讨书一份呈交北京市人民法院。
    李文斗在检讨书中首先承认：非法拘禁助产士马静承与王立志一事是侵犯人身自由、违反共同纲领的错误行为。他承认北京市人民法院虽然没有给他以刑事处分，但是他所犯的错误是无可掩饰的。
    李文斗在检讨书中说：由于他存在着封建思想，以致把马静承、王立志与李华杰的交往认为是不正确的男女关系，甚至无原则地参加了郁文主持的干涉马静承与王立志自由的“检讨会”。在会上，他不但没有纠正郁文侵犯马静承等自由权利的错误行为，相反地还助长了她这一错误行为。当郁文停止马静承、王立志的工作，并侵犯了她们的人身自由的时候，他未能坚定地站在工会的立场上，维护会员的合法权利。对取消马静承的区民主妇联代表资格一事，他虽未参加任何意见；但是，当郁文主使女同志们重新改选妇女代表时，他也没有积极地提出反对意见，以致助长了侵犯马静承的政治权利的错误行为。
    李文斗在检讨中最后称：这次，虽然政府对他从宽处理，没有给他刑事处分，但他觉得他的错误是严重的，除登报作自我检讨外，并向卫生局及区工会办事处请求处分。
