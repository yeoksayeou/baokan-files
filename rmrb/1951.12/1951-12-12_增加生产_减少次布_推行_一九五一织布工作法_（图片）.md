    Increase Production, Reduce Defective Cloths
    Promote the "1951 Weaving Method"
    (1) The 1951 Weaving Method is based on the summary of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, using the Kovalev Work Method, and summarizing the advantages of the exemplary operating methods of weaving from various regions through twenty days of demonstration, observation, measurement, analysis, and research. The 1951 Weaving Method includes both automatic loom work methods and ordinary loom work methods, suitable for promotion throughout the country. The characteristics of this work method are preventing yarn breakage, reducing defective cloths, and increasing productivity, making work regular and planned, which can strengthen the initiative of workers. This is the venue of the general meeting of the 1951 Weaving Method Summary Conference and the opening ceremony of the training class.
    (2) The work of automatic loom workers is multi-machine operation, generally seeing more than sixteen looms, so there must be a set of patrol rules for managing multiple machines in order to properly manage the machines. The main work during the patrol is to check the cloth surface, warp beams, and handle downtime. A large patrol is divided into two small patrols, and the average time for each large patrol is six minutes, with a maximum of no more than eight minutes, so that yarn defects and defective cloths can be detected and properly handled in a timely manner. This is a scene of workers on duty patrolling.
    (3) According to the provisions of the 1951 Weaving Method, the automatic loom workers on duty always patrol according to a certain route to manage the work of each loom. A large patrol includes two small patrols. In each large patrol, the cloth surface of all machines should be checked twice and the warp beams once. The patrol starts in front of machines (1) and (7). After checking twelve cloth surfaces, turn into the fourth alley and check another twelve cloth surfaces. Exit the fourth alley and turn left into the third alley to check the warp beams on the right. Then turn right into the first alley to check the warp beams and return to the original starting point, thus ending a small patrol. Then start the second small patrol, check twenty-four cloth surfaces and the warp beams on the right side of the fifth and third alleys, and return to the original starting point, thus ending a large patrol. Afterwards, continue patrolling according to this route repeatedly.
    (4) Although automatic loom workers on duty must patrol according to a certain route, they must still be flexible and prioritize according to the urgency and importance, leaving the patrol route to handle downtime and other tasks. For example, if downtime is found at machine (9) when patrolling to the fourth alley (see Figure (1)), the worker should immediately go through the machine-side alley closest to machine (9) to handle the downtime, and return to the original patrol route to continue forward after completion. If multiple machines are found to be stopped during the patrol, they should be handled according to the order of downtime and the difficulty (see Figure (2)). If machines (11) and (5) are found to be stopped at the same time when patrolling to the fifth alley, the worker should immediately go through the machine-side alley closest to machine (5) to handle the downtime. If machines (12) and (4) are found to be stopped successively during the handling, they should continue to be handled before returning to the original patrol route to move forward. When handling multiple downtime situations, the patrol cycle of the cloth surface should be taken into account, and even the inspection of the warp beams can be reduced once.
    (5) Vigorously doing a good job of inspection is one of the important tasks for preventing downtime and reducing defective cloths. When checking the cloth surface, use your hands to feel the cloth surface. If you find a defective cloth, stop the machine immediately and put up a defective cloth signal. If the defective cloth is a phenomenon such as weft breakage, weft shrinkage, thick weft, or sparse dents, check the weft yarn, shuttle, and three-finger hook for any problems and deal with them in time to avoid continuous production of defective cloths. This is a scene of using hands to feel the cloth surface to check for defective cloths.
    (6) When checking the warp beam, use your fingers to lightly pluck the warp yarn to help find defects in order to deal with bad warp yarns such as hairy yarn, large knots, and multiple ends in time. Small defects should be corrected with scissors, and large defects should be broken off and replaced with joint yarn, so that the warp yarn can pass through the heddle and reed smoothly without causing yarn breakage and producing defective cloths. This is a scene of workers on duty checking the warp beams.
    (7) Sectional shuttle changing is the central link in the operation of ordinary looms. The 1951 Weaving Method adopts the method of two sections and four segments for exchanging shuttles on the platform, according to the principle of reasonable operation, which is the most suitable for the actual situation of general textile factories at present. If conditions are good, two sections and eight segments of shuttle changing can be adopted to keep shuttle changing regular. This is a scene of workers on duty adding small weft yarns to adjust the shuttle changing sequence, so as to prevent the shuttle changing work from becoming chaotic.
    (8) In order to suit the actual situation of general factories, the shuttle changing rule of ordinary looms should currently be mainly in the form of two sections and four segments for shuttle changing. In eight looms, every four looms are a large section, and each pair of looms is a small segment. The shuttle changing work is carried out in the order of segments (see figure), but the shuttle changing sequence in each small segment can be carried out in different orders according to the situation. The advantage of this shuttle changing method is that it can concentrate the shuttle changing time as much as possible and strive for initiative, so that there is not only enough time to do a good job of checking the cloth surface and handling yarn breakage, but also less time wasted.
    (9) In the past, ordinary loom workers on duty could not grasp the shuttle changing time, and were worried about passive shuttle changing, so they were not at ease to go out of the alley for patrol work. Therefore, they could not prevent yarn breakage as much as possible, which increased the chance of producing defective cloths. Now that the shuttle changing work is concentrated in a shorter period of time, before the second shuttle change, the cloth surface can be checked in front of the machine to find the defective cloth as early as possible, and the warp beam can be checked behind the machine to remove the defects on the warp yarn, preventing yarn breakage and producing defective cloths. This is a scene of workers on duty checking the cloth surface during a patrol on an ordinary loom.
    (10) The patrol work of ordinary looms is also carried out according to a certain route and a certain cycle. After the weft is changed and loaded on each segment (i.e., two looms), the cloth surface of the two looms is checked. After the weft is changed and loaded on the last two looms, the warp beam is checked behind the even-numbered machines (see the black line in the figure) and returned to the original starting point. Then, the weft is changed and loaded again, the cloth surface is checked, and the warp beam of the odd-numbered machines is checked (see the dotted line in the figure). During the patrol, downtime can be handled dynamically. This regular patrol can greatly improve the output and quality of the cloth.
    (11) In addition to doing a good job of checking the cloth surface and warp beam during the patrol, attention must also be paid to the inspection of machine parts, and this work should be appropriately distributed in each patrol. If abnormal phenomena are found in machine parts such as stretchers, three-finger hooks, dragon gate baffles, sparse dent needles, and heddle frames during the patrol, the worker should adjust what they can adjust themselves. If they cannot adjust themselves, they should immediately put up a machine repair signal, which can directly prevent the production of defective cloths. This is a scene of workers on duty checking the shuttle.
    (12) Multi-machine management must rationally grasp the working time, distinguish priorities, and work dynamically. The 1951 Weaving Method takes a patrol as a work unit, and all the work of the worker on duty should be appropriately distributed in each patrol. For example, if there is more downtime to handle in a certain patrol, the walking speed should be faster, and even the inspection of the warp beam can be reduced once, in order to strive to take care of the cloth surface in time, so that the cloth surface patrol cycle does not exceed four minutes, which can change the past chaotic phenomenon. This is a scene of the worker on duty reducing the inspection of the warp beam once to handle the downtime after finding that there is more downtime.
    (13) Weaving work is mostly a series of repeated actions. The 1951 Weaving Method makes every action regular and shortens the time of each action. If downtime is found during the patrol and should be handled, first take a brief look at whether there are any defects on the cloth surface of the opposite loom, and at the same time take out the hook and put it on the cloth surface of the downtime loom together with the scissors in hand for easy access, and then carry out shuttle insertion, heddle leveling, find the broken end and connect it, and then put on the heddle and reed to start the machine. After the machine is started, take a brief look at the operating conditions, and then return to the original place to carefully check the cloth surface of the opposite loom and continue to move forward. This is a scene of shuttle insertion.
    (14) During the patrol, the scissors are always held in the right hand (the scissors head does not protrude from the hand). When scissors are needed to inspect the warp beam or handle cloth surface floss, they can be used immediately, unlike in the past when the scissors were placed in the pocket, wasting time putting them in and taking them out. (However, ordinary loom workers on duty must hold the scissors in their right hand only when checking the warp beam.)
    (15) If bad warp yarn is found between the drop wire and the heddle wire that needs to be threaded and joined, the drop wire can be pierced with a hook, and then the bad yarn strip can be broken off and replaced with a joint yarn, so that it can be handled without stopping the machine. This is a scene of the worker on duty piercing the drop wire with a hook and then threading and joining the yarn.
    (16) If the bad warp yarn has reached near the heddle wire, the warp yarn should be broken between the back beam and the drop wire, and the cloth surface yarn tail should be tightened to prevent the drop wire from falling. Join the joint yarn to the cloth surface yarn tail and the warp beam yarn tail, put down the yarn strip, stop the machine, and then go around to the front of the machine to pull out the yarn strip and start the machine. This can not only save the action of threading the heddle and reed, but also reduce the downtime. This is a scene of tightening the yarn strip and joining the end.
    (17) If the broken end is in the middle of the drop wire and the back beam, and the cloth surface yarn tail can be found, if it is necessary to go around to the back of the machine to join the end, the joint yarn can be joined at the front of the machine first, the yarn strip can be picked up and the machine started, and then the worker can go around to the back of the machine to find the warp beam tail yarn and join the end, which can also shorten the downtime. This is a scene of going around to the back of the machine after pulling up the yarn strip and starting the machine.
    (18) A reasonable weft loading method and shuttle throwing method can make the weft loading work light and reduce floss. In the weft loading action, the pulled out weft yarn does not exceed fifteen inches. When introducing the weft yarn into the shuttle mouth, gently press the top of the weft tube with the left thumb, so that the weft yarn is not continuously pulled out when the weft yarn is drawn out of the shuttle mouth. When throwing the shuttle, quickly press the yarn tail on the cloth in front of the weaving mouth with your hand, so that the yarn does not curl in the shuttle mouth, and the yarn tail is no more than five inches long, which can improve the quality of the cloth and reduce the waste of weft yarn. This is a scene of the worker on duty on an ordinary loom throwing the shuttle into the shuttle box when changing the shuttle.

### 增加生产  减少次布  推行“一九五一织布工作法”（图片）

    增加生产  减少次布
    推行“一九五一织布工作法”
    （一）一九五一织布工作法是在总结郝建秀工作法的基础上，运用郭瓦廖夫工作法，经过二十天表演、观察、测定、分析和研究，集中了各地区织布模范操作方法上的优点而总结出来的。一九五一织布工作法包括自动布机工作法和普通布机工作法两部分，适合在全国各地推行。这个工作法的特点是预防断头、减少次布、提高生产率，使工作有规律有计划，这样可以加强工人工作的主动性。这是一九五一织布工作法总结大会暨训练班开学典礼时的大会会场。
    （二）自动布机工人的工作是多机台操作，一般要看到十六台布机以上，因此就必须要有一套管理多机台的巡回规律，以便适当地去管理机台。巡回中的主要工作是检查布面、经轴和处理停台。一个大巡回分成两个小巡回，每个大巡回的平均时间为六分钟，最多不超过八分钟，这样就能及时发现和适当处理经纱疵点和次布。这是当车工人进行巡回工作时的情形。
    （三）依照一九五一织布工作法的规定，自动布机的当车工人总是依着一定的路线巡回，进行管理每台布机的工作。一个大巡回包括两个小巡回，在每次大巡回中应该检查两次全部机台的布面和一次经轴。巡回从（1）和（7）号车前开始，检查十二台布面后，即转入第四弄又检查十二台布面，出第四弄向左转入第三弄检查右边的经轴，再右转入第一弄检查经轴后返回原来起点，这样一个小巡回即告结束。接着开始第二个小巡回，进行检查二十四台布面和第五弄、第三弄右边的经轴后返回原起点，这样一个大巡回即告结束。以后即周而复始地依着这样的路线继续巡回。
    （四）自动布机当车工人虽然必须依着一定的路线巡回，但必要时仍须灵活运用，分清轻重缓急，机动地离开巡回路线去进行处理停台等工作。例如巡回到第四弄时发现（9）号车停台（见图（一）），就应立即通过（9）号最近的机侧车弄去处理停台，完毕后仍返原巡回路线继续前进。在巡回中如发现多台停车时，即应依照停台先后及难易分别处理（见图（二））。巡回到第五弄时如发现（11）与（5）号车同时停台时，应即通过（5）号车最近机侧车弄去处理；如在处理完毕时又发现（12）与（4）号车先后停台，就应继续处理后再返回原巡回路线前进。处理多台停车时应照顾到布面的巡回周期，甚至可以少验一次经轴。
    （五）大力做好检查是预防停台、减少次布的重要工作之一。检查布面时应用手抚摸布面，发现次布时应立即停车，立起拆布信号牌。如次布是脱纬、纬缩、粗纬、稀弄等现象时，应即检查纬纱、梭子、三指钩等有没毛病，及时加以处理，避免连续产生次布。这是用手抚摸布面检查次布时的情形。
    （六）在检查经轴时，应用手指轻拨经纱，帮助发现疵点，以便及时处理羽毛纱、大结头、多头等不良经纱。小疵点应用剪刀修正，大疵点应该摘断换上接头纱，这样可以使经纱能顺利地通过综筘而不致引起断头和产生次布。这是当车工人在检查经轴时的情形。
    （七）分段换梭是普通布机操作上的中心环节。一九五一织布工作法依照合理操作的原则，采用了两段四节对台换梭的方法，是最适合目前一般纺织厂的实际情况。如条件好时，可以采取两段八节换梭，使换梭经常保持有规律。这是当车工人正加进小纬纱来调节换梭顺序，以便使换梭工作不致混乱。
    （八）为了适合一般工厂实际情况，普通布机的换梭规律在目前应以两段四节换梭为主要形式。在八台布机中每四台为一大段，每对台为一小节，依节顺序进行换梭工作（见图），但在每小节内的换梭顺序可以分别情况先后进行。这个换梭办法的优点就是可以尽量集中换梭时间，争取主动，这样不但可以有充分时间做好检查布面和处理断头的工作，同时也可以少走冤枉路。
    （九）以前普通布机当车工人因换梭时间不能掌握，担心被动换梭，所以就不放心走出车弄做巡回工作，因此不能尽量防止断头，使产生次布的机会增加。现在换梭工作集中在较短的时间内，在还没有到第二次换梭以前，能够在机前检查布面使次布及早发现，在机后检查经轴，把经纱上的疵点去掉，预防断头和产生次布。这是普通布机当车工人在巡回中检查布面时的情形。
    （十）普通布机的巡回工作也是依照一定路线和一定周期进行的。在每节（即两台）布机换梭装纬完毕后，就检查该两台布机的布面，依次至最后两台布机的换梭完毕后，即在双号机台后（见图内黑线）巡回检查经轴后返回原起点，再次进行换梭、检查布面，并检查单号机的经轴（见图内虚线），在巡回中并可机动地处理停台。这种有规律的巡回，可以大大提高布的产量和品质。
    （十一）在巡回中除了做好布面、经轴的检查工作以外，并须注意机件的检查，将这一工作适当地分配在每一巡回中进行。巡回中如发现伸幅器、三指钩、龙门挡、稀弄针、综框等机件有不正常现象时，能调整的就自己调整，如自己不能调整时应即立起修机信号牌，这样可以直接预防次布的产生。这是当车工人在检查梭子时的情形。
    （十二）多机台管理必须要合理地掌握工作时间，分别轻重缓急，机动地进行工作。一九五一织布工作法是以一个巡回作为一个工作单位的，当车工人的各项工作都应该适当地分配在每一个巡回中进行。如在某一个巡回中处理停台较多时，行走速度就应较快，甚至可以少验一次经轴，以便争取及时照顾布面，使布面巡回的周期不超过四分钟，这样可以改变过去的忙乱现象。这是发现停台较多后当车工人就少验一次经轴处理停台的情形。
    （十三）织布工作多半是一连串的重复动作。一九五一织布工作法使每一个动作都有规律性，缩短了每一个动作的时间。在巡回中如发现停台应该处理时，应先略看对面台车的布面有无疵布，同时取出钩子，连同手中的剪刀放在停台的布面上，便利即时取用，然后进行纳梭、平综、找出断头接好后，再穿综筘开车。车开后略看运转情况，即返回原地仔细验看对台车的布面继续前进。这是纳梭时的情形。
    （十四）当车工人在巡回中，剪刀总是握在右手的（剪刀头不露出手外）。在检验经轴或处理布面回丝需用剪刀时，就可即时使用。不像过去把剪刀放在口袋内，放进拿出浪费时间。（但普通布机当车工人是必须在检查经轴时，才把剪刀握在右手。）
    （十五）在落片与综丝中间如发现不良经纱需要理纱接头时，可以用钩子穿住落片，再摘断不良纱条换上接头纱，这样可以不停车处理。这是当车工人用钩子穿住落片后理纱接头时的情形。
      （十六）不良经纱如已到综丝附近时，就应该在后梁与落片中间摘断经纱，拉紧布面纱尾，不让落片掉下。在布面纱尾和经轴纱尾上，接上接头纱，放下纱条停车，然后再绕到车前拉出纱条后开车。这样不仅可以省去穿综筘的动作，又可减少停台时间。这是拉紧纱条接头时的情形。
      （十七）遇到断头在落片及后梁中间，而又能找到布面纱尾时，如必须绕到车后去接头，可先在车前接上接头纱，提起纱条开车，然后再绕到车后去找到经轴尾纱接头，这样也可以缩短停车时间。这是拉起纱条开车后绕到车后去的情形。
    （十八）合理的装纬方法与投梭方法能使装纬工作轻捷和减少回丝。在装纬动作上，拉出的纬纱不超过十五吋，把纬纱引入梭口时，用左手母指轻轻压住纬管顶端，以便使纬纱引出梭口时，不致把纬纱继续拉出来。投梭时，迅速用手压纱尾在织口前布上，可使纱在梭口内不蜷曲，纱尾又不长过五吋，这样可以改善布的品质和减少纬纱的浪费。这是普通布机当车工人在换梭时投梭入梭箱时的情形。
