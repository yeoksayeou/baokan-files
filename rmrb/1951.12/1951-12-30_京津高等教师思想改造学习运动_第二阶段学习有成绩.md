Beijing and Tianjin Higher Education Teachers' Ideological Remolding Study Movement has entered the second stage since Comrade Peng Zhen made a report on "Some Ideological Issues Related to the Three Major Movements" on November 18th. The main purpose of this stage of study is to draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy internationally and domestically, and to eliminate the reactionary remnants of imperialist and feudalist thinking. In order to more effectively promote this study movement, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council held its 29th committee meeting on November 28th, focusing on strengthening the leadership of the study movement. At the meeting, Hu Qiaomu, Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee, pointed out, in response to the shortcomings of the previous stage of study: In the future, the study committees of each school must take practical responsibility for leading the teachers' study, and the heads of each school must lead by example, take the initiative, and earnestly take on the responsibility of leadership. He emphasized that teachers should strengthen their study of documents in the future to master theoretical weapons and engage in criticism and self-criticism in connection with their own ideological reality. According to Hu Qiaomu's instructions, the Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Teachers' Study Committee of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, in addition to specifically stipulating the steps of study, formulating outlines for document discussion, and urging the study committees of each school to earnestly organize document study, also hired more than 20 reporters, more than 10 instructors and liaison officers to give auxiliary reports to various schools and assist the study committees of various schools in carrying out their work.

Since entering the second stage of study, teachers in various schools have generally strengthened their study of documents. On average, more than 80 percent of teachers in each school have seriously read the documents and made study notes. The heads of many schools have also made reports on studying the documents. Teachers generally spend 12 to 15 hours a week studying documents. After carefully studying the documents, they have gained a lot and solved many ideological problems. In order to help teachers study the documents, the Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Teachers' Study Committee of the Ministry of Education invited Deng Tuo, Minister of Propaganda of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, to give a report on "The Purpose and Method of Studying Documents" on December 16th. His report was very enlightening and helpful to teachers in further studying the documents.

In this stage of study, thanks to the strengthening of ideological leadership and organizational leadership by the study committees of various schools, teachers' study has been further developed. Most schools have established regular meeting and reporting systems. Many school leaders personally listen to reports and guide group work. The members of the study committees of many schools have also organized groups to seriously study documents, study problems, grasp the ideological situation of teachers, arrange and plan work, and pay attention to using the "Study Newspaper" held by various schools for teachers' study to guide learning. Many members of the study committees of some schools have also made reports on their experiences in studying documents. Schools where the previous stage of study progressed slowly have mostly made up lessons, and each group has carried out inspections of their study attitudes, changing the "half-baked" phenomenon that existed in some schools in the past.

In order to give teachers sufficient and complete study time, and at the same time not affect teachers' teaching plans and other work in the next semester, the Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Teachers' Study Committee of the Ministry of Education decided at its third committee meeting held on December 21 that teachers should concentrate their time and energy on studying during the winter vacation.

    京津高等教师思想改造学习运动
    第二阶段学习有成绩
    北京、天津高等学校教师思想改造学习运动，自十一月十八日彭真同志作了“有关三大运动的一些思想问题”的报告后，已进入第二阶段。这一阶段学习的主要目的是从国际和国内方面划清敌我界限，清除帝国主义和封建主义的反动残余思想。为了更有效地推动这一学习运动，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会曾在十一月二十八日召开第二十九次委务会议，会上着重讨论了加强学习运动的领导问题。会上，文化教育委员会秘书长胡乔木针对过去一阶段学习中的缺点，明确地指出：今后各校分学习委员会要切实负责领导教师们的学习，各校负责人必须以身作则，亲自动手，切实担负起领导责任来。他着重指出，教师们今后要加强对文件的学习，以掌握理论武器，联系自己的思想实际，展开批评和自我批评。中央人民政府教育部京津高等学校教师学习委员会根据胡乔木的指示，除具体规定学习步骤，拟定文件讨论提纲，督促各校分学习委员会认真组织文件学习外，并聘请了报告员二十多人，辅导员和联络员十多人，分别到各校作辅助报告，并协助各校分学习委员会进行工作。
    各校教师在进入第二阶段学习以来，普遍地加强了对文件的学习。各校平均有百分之八十以上的教师，认真阅读了文件，并作出心得笔记。许多学校的负责人还作了有关学习文件的报告。教师们每星期学习文件的时间一般为十二小时到十五小时。他们在认真学习文件以后，都有很大收获，并解决了许多思想问题。为了帮助教师们研究文件，教育部京津高等学校教师学习委员会在十二月十六日请中共北京市委员会宣传部长邓拓作了“学习文件的目的和方法”的报告。他的报告对教师们进一步学习文件有很大的启发和帮助。
    在这一阶段的学习中，由于各校分学习委员会加强了思想领导和组织领导，教师们的学习有了进一步的开展。大部分学校都建立了经常的会议和汇报制度。许多学校的负责人都亲自听取汇报，指导小组工作。许多学校分学习委员会的委员也组织了小组，认真学习文件，研究问题，掌握教师思想情况，布置和计划工作，并注意运用各校为教师学习举办的“学习报”来指导学习。不少学校的分学习委员会的委员还作了学习文件心得的报告。在前一阶段学习进展较慢的学校，大都进行了补课，各小组进行了学习态度的检查，改变了过去某些学校存在的“夹生饭”现象。
    为了使教师们有充分的完整的学习时间，同时又不致影响下学期教师们教学计划和其他工作，教育部京津高等学校教师学习委员会在十二月二十一日举行的第三次委员会议上决定教师们在寒假期内集中时间和精力进行学习。    （新华社）
