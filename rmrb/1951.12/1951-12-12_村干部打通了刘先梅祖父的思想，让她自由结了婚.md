Liu Xianmei of Pandao Village, Fourth District, Fencheng County, Shanxi Province, lost her parents early and lived with her grandfather. As Xianmei grew up day by day, people in the village were concerned about who she would marry in the future.

Cao Runsheng, a member of the Communist Youth League in the village, lived very close to Xianmei's house. They often met and talked and laughed together. Some people in the village, seeing that the two of them were very close and had reached marriageable age, mentioned marriage to them. They were both willing. Later, someone mentioned this to Xianmei's grandfather, but the old man said, "Only if you give me seven stones of wheat." In order to get grain, Xianmei's grandfather found her another suitor. Xianmei firmly opposed this, saying to her grandfather, "You can marry whoever you like!" After the village cadres understood the situation, they repeatedly persuaded and educated her grandfather, and finally convinced the old man.

Xianmei and Runsheng were the first couple in the village to marry freely. Many people came to watch the wedding. Everyone said, "Free marriage is good." The old ladies also said, "I have never seen anything like this in my life. It saves money and is lively. Everyone knows each other, so there's no chance of anger." After the marriage, the two became even more active in production. Xianmei came back from the fields every day to cook and tidy up the house, and she also spun cotton at night. Now, they not only do a good job in their own fields, but also cultivate Xianmei's grandfather's fields well. Xianmei's grandfather happily said to everyone he met, "I have a good granddaughter and a good grandson-in-law. Free marriage is really good."

    村干部打通了刘先梅祖父的思想，让她自由结了婚
    山西省汾城县四区盘道村刘先梅，父母早死，跟着祖父过日子。先梅一天天地长大了，村里的人都关心她将来要和什么人结婚。
    本村青年团员曹润生，和先梅家住得很近。两人经常见面，有说有笑。村中有些人，看他们两人很要好，又都到了结婚的年龄，就向他俩提起婚事。他俩都很愿意。后来，有人向先梅的祖父提起了这件事，老汉却说：“只要给七石麦子就可以。”为了得粮食，先梅的祖父给她另外找了一个婆家。先梅坚决反对，向祖父说：“你喜欢谁家，你去！”村干部了解这种情况后，便向她祖父再三进行说服教育，最后把老汉的思想打通了。
    先梅和润生是村中第一对自由结婚的。结婚时，来看的人特别多。大家都说：“自由结婚就是好。”老太太们还说：“一辈子没见过这事情，又省钱，又热闹。谁都知道谁，保险不生气。”结婚后，两人生产更积极了，先梅每天下地回来，就做饭、整理家务，夜间还纺花。现在，他们不但把自己地里的活弄得很好，而且把先梅祖父的地也种得好好的。先梅的祖父见人就高兴地说：“有了好孙女，也有好孙女婿，还是自由结婚好。”
