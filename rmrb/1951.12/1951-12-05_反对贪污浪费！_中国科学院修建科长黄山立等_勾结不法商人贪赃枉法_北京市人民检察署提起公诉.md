    Oppose Corruption and Waste!
    Huang Shanli, Construction Section Chief of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Others Collude with Illegal Merchants to Embezzle Public Funds; Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Files a Public Prosecution
    Huang Shanli (formerly a puppet town mayor), Construction Section Chief of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xie Yuyuan (formerly an officer in the reactionary army), staff member of the Beijing Branch of the China Construction Corporation, assistant engineer Xu Dunyan, and Ma Youmin, staff member of the China Construction Corporation, had previously jointly stolen and sold cement belonging to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. During the bidding process for construction projects at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, they abused their authority, colluded with Wang Decun, manager of the privately-owned Yifeng Iron Factory in Beijing, and Liu Fengtu, manager of the privately-owned Dachunghua Brick and Tile Company, to engage in private gain and embezzle public funds, seriously damaging the interests of the country. At the time, Huang Shanli, under the pretext of accepting a "reasonable bid," deceived his superiors and designated Yifeng Iron Factory to contract the A-level project and Jianye Iron Factory to contract the B-level project. In these two projects, Huang Shanli embezzled a total of 60.59 million yuan, Xie Yuyuan embezzled 14.45 million yuan, Xu Dunyan embezzled 11.85 million yuan, Ma Youmin embezzled 17.25 million yuan, and Liu Fengtu illegally obtained 17 million yuan. After verifying the illegal acts of the above-mentioned criminals, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution on behalf of the state, and the Beijing Municipal People's Court will impose sanctions according to the law.

    反对贪污浪费！
    中国科学院修建科长黄山立等
    勾结不法商人贪赃枉法
    北京市人民检察署提起公诉
    中国科学院修建科科长黄山立（曾任伪镇长）、中国建筑企业公司北京分公司职员谢遇元（曾任反动军队的官员）、助理工程师徐敦衍及中国建筑企业公司职员马友民等，过去曾共同盗卖过中国科学院的水泥。他们在中国科学院建筑工程招标期间，利用职权，勾结北京市私营亿丰铁工厂经理王德村和私营大中华砖瓦行经理刘凤图等，共同营私舞弊，侵蚀公款，严重地损害了国家的利益。黄山立当时以接受“合理标”为藉口，欺骗上级，圈定亿丰铁工厂承包甲标工程，健业铁工厂承包乙标工程。在这两项工程中，总计黄山立从中贪污六千零五十九万元，谢遇元贪污一千四百四十五万元，徐敦衍贪污一千一百八十五万元，马友民贪污一千七百二十五万元，刘凤图则非法取得一千七百万元。北京市人民检察署对上述各犯违法行为检察属实后，已代表国家提起公诉，将由北京市人民法院依法予以制裁。 李金
