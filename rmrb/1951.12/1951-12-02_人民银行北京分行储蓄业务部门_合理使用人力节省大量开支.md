    People's Bank of China Beijing Branch Savings Department:
    Rational Use of Manpower Saves Significant Expenses
    The department handling savings business at the People's Bank of China, Beijing Branch, has fully leveraged the potential capabilities of its staff. From January to October this year, they saved an average of 46.3% in manpower, saving the state 2.17 billion yuan in expenses. Simultaneously, by adopting publicity methods that reached deeply into the masses, they saved the state 1.89 billion yuan in publicity expenses during the ten months, with actual publicity expenses accounting for only 8.3% of the budgeted amount.
    The patriotic labor emulation drive has promoted the development of the bank's savings business. The savings staff have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. For example, in June, the branch stipulated that the task for the entire month was to open 6,300 new accounts and absorb 21.7 billion yuan in deposits. After the tasks were assigned, everyone voluntarily increased the targets, increasing the number of accounts by 400 over the original plan and the amount by 7 billion yuan. The internal staff engaged in "three-fast movements" (fast abacus calculation, fast slip writing, and fast money counting), which significantly improved work efficiency. Most units' internal staff could ensure same-day posting. The external staff, under the slogan of "fear no hardship, fear no trouble," worked actively. Some external staff left early and returned late, actively seeking out blank savings accounts and organizing savings groups. Most external staff also used Sundays, holidays, or lunch breaks to automatically go to parks, Beihai, and other places or to various government agencies and enterprises to collect savings. At the same time, all staff members came up with many new working methods to solve the difficulty of having few personnel but many tasks. They generally adopted a group responsibility system (with three people in a group, including one for bookkeeping, one for cashiering, and one for review). Since its implementation, the time spent processing each savings transaction has been reduced by half.

    人民银行北京分行储蓄业务部门
    合理使用人力节省大量开支
    中国人民银行北京分行办理储蓄业务的部门，充分发挥了工作人员的潜在能力，今年一至十月，平均节省了百分之四十六点三的人力，为国家节约开支二十一亿七千余万元。同时，由于采用了深入群众的宣传方法，十个月中为国家节约宣传费用十八亿九千余万元，所用宣传费用仅占规定额的百分之八点三。
    爱国主义劳动竞赛，推动了该行储蓄业务的开展。该行储蓄业务人员发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。如六月份分行规定全月开展储蓄业务的任务是开户六千三百户，吸收存款二百十七亿元。任务分配下去以后，大家自动增加任务，户数照规定增多四百户，金额照原规定增加七亿元。各单位储蓄工作内勤人员通过“三快运动”（算盘打得快，传票开得快，钞票点得快），工作效率有显著提高。多数单位的内勤人员都能保证当日入账。外勤人员在“不怕劳苦、不怕麻烦”的口号下，积极工作。有的外勤人员早出晚归，积极寻找空白储蓄户和组织储蓄小组。多数外勤人员并利用星期日、节日、或中午休息时间，自动到公园、北海等地或各机关、企业进行收储工作。同时全体工作人员在工作中想出许多新的工作方法，解决了人员少业务多的困难。他们普遍地采用了小组负责制（以三人为一组，内有记帐一人、出纳一人、复核一人），实行以来，处理每笔储蓄的时间比以前快了一倍。
