    The Decision to Reduce National Gauze Prices
    Further Strengthened My Confidence in Building the Motherland
    Comrade Editor: After reading the "Decision to Reduce National Gauze Prices" published in the People's Daily on November 30th, I felt extremely happy. I remember that in the first half of this year, American imperialism, manipulating its puppet states, passed a "ban proposal" against China, attempting to undermine our economic construction. However, the American imperialist "embargo" went bankrupt. Now, not only do we have an abundance of cotton, but we have also reduced the price of gauze. This fully demonstrates that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, no matter what methods American imperialism uses to obstruct our construction, are able to overcome all difficulties. Through this fact, I deeply feel the loveliness of our great motherland, and it has further strengthened my confidence in the construction of the motherland.

### 降低全国纱布价格的决定  更加强了我建设祖国的信心

    降低全国纱布价格的决定
    更加强了我建设祖国的信心
    编辑同志：读了十一月三十日人民日报刊载的关于“降低全国纱布价格的决定”以后，我感到万分的高兴。记得在今年上半年，美帝国主义曾操纵它的仆从国家通过了一个对中国的“禁运提案”，企图破坏我国的经济建设。但是，美帝国主义的“禁运”破产了，现在我们不但有了充裕的棉花，并且还降低了纱布的价格。这充分说明了中国人民在伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，不管美帝国主义用什么办法来阻挠我们的建设，一切困难都是能够克服的。通过这一事实，我更深切地体会到我们伟大祖国的可爱，也更加强了对祖国建设的信心。
