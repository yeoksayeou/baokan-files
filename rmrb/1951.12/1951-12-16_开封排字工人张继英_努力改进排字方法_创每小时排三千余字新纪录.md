Kaifeng Typesetter Zhang Jiying
    Strives to Improve Typesetting Methods
    Sets New Record of Over 3,000 Characters Per Hour
    Zhang Jiying, a typesetter at the state-owned Henan Dazhong Printing Factory in Kaifeng City, has created an outstanding record in lead typesetting efficiency. In the sixteen months from July of last year to October of this year, his typesetting volume reached an average of more than 2,600 characters per hour, with a maximum of 3,400 characters per hour, and a error rate of only 0.13% (the ordinary rate is 1,500 characters per hour with an error rate of 0.2%). Zhang Jiying was able to create such an outstanding production record because, under the education of the Party, he gradually established a new attitude towards labor. This is the result of his willingness to use his brain and strive to learn and study his work. When Zhang Jiying came to work in the typesetting room of Dazhong Printing Factory in 1949, the average typesetting speed of workers was 1,300 characters per hour. He studied the reason for the slow typesetting speed and found that the type case was too large (a total of 24 trays), and moving left and right during typesetting wasted time. He suggested adopting the type case style of Zhengzhou Xinhua Bookstore Printing Factory (a total of 18 trays) and the new typesetting order of Shandong Xinhua Bookstore Printing Factory (arranged according to the relationship between characters). As a result of this improvement of the type case, the work efficiency of the entire typesetting room increased by 30% compared to before. Zhang Jiying's speed increased from 2,000 characters per hour to 2,200 characters per hour. After successfully transforming the type case, Zhang Jiying continued to study and created new methods to save working time. He shortened the time for his right hand to help his left hand pull out the manuscript a lot. At the same time, whenever a section was about to be completed, he would pick up characters while reading the following text. He also prepared commonly used nouns and phrases in advance, and took them all at once when needed. This greatly improved work efficiency. Several typesetters at Dazhong Printing Factory have already learned Zhang Jiying's advanced working methods and have increased their typesetting rate to over 2,000 characters per hour.

    开封排字工人张继英
    努力改进排字方法
    创每小时排三千余字新纪录
    开封市国营河南省大众印刷厂排字工人张继英在排铅字的效率上创造了优异的纪录，从去年七月到今年十月的十六个月中，排字数量达到平均每小时二千六百多个，最高时达到每小时三千四百个，错字率只占千分之一点三（普通则为每一小时排字一千五百，错字率为千分之二）。张继英所以能够创造出这样优异的生产纪录，是因为在党的教育下他逐渐地树立了新的劳动态度，这是他肯开动脑筋、努力学习钻研业务的结果。一九四九年张继英到大众印刷厂排字房工作时，工人排字平均每小时一千三百字，他研究出排字慢的原因是字架子太大（总字数二十四盘），排字时左右移动，浪费时间。他建议采用郑州新华书店印刷厂的字架样式（总字数十八盘）和山东新华书店印刷厂新的排字次序（按照字与字的关系排列），这样改进字架子的结果，全工房工作效率较前提高了百分之三十。张继英由每小时两千字上升为两千二百字。把字架子改造成功后，张继英又继续钻研，创造了节省工作时间的新方法，他把右手帮助左手往外拉稿的时间缩短了许多，同时每当一段快排完时他就一边拣字一边看下文，他又把常用的名词和短语事先预备好，需用时一次取来。这样便大大地提高了工作效率。大众印刷厂的排字工人已经有好几位学习了张继英的先进工作方法，并已将排字率提高到每小时二千字以上。
