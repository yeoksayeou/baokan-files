Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 8th: According to TASS, after a two-week strike by 100,000 American copper mining and smelting workers in August, the US Wage Stabilization Board, after a long period of delay, recently approved a 15% hourly wage increase. The majority of the workers participating in this strike were members of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, an independent progressive union that led this strike against the wage freeze. A small portion of the striking workers were members of the AFL and CIO affiliated unions, as well as independent railway workers' unions, involved in copper, lead, and zinc mining and smelting industries in the southwestern states. The Wage Stabilization Board's decision applies to workers at three major companies, "Kennecott Copper Corporation," "Phelps Dodge Corporation," and "American Smelting and Refining Company," and nine smaller companies. However, the Wage Stabilization Board did not similarly approve wage increases for workers at "Anaconda Copper Mining Company," the largest copper smelting company in the United States.

    反对美政府冻结工资
    美国铜矿工人罢工斗争获胜
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约八日讯：十万美国采铜和炼铜工人自从八月间举行了两星期的罢工以后，美国工资稳定委员会经过长时期的拖延，在最近才批准了每小时增加工资百分之十五。参加这次罢工的工人大多是领导这次反对冻结工资罢工的美国国际开采冶炼工会的会员，这是一个独立的进步的工会。罢工工人中有一小部分是与西南部各州铜、铅、锌的开采和冶炼业有关系的劳联和产联所属的工会以及独立的铁路员工工会的会员。工资稳定委员会的决定适用于“肯奈柯特铜公司”、“菲尔普斯·道奇公司”、“美国熔炼公司”这三个大公司和九个小公司的工人。但是，工资稳定委员会没有同样地批准增加“安那康达铜矿公司”这家美国最大的炼铜公司的工人的工资。
