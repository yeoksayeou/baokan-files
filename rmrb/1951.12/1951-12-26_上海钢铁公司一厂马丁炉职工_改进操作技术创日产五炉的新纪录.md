    Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant Martin Furnace Workers
    Improve Operating Techniques, Setting New Record of Five Heats Per Day
    To the Editor: The Martin furnace at the smelting department of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant set a new record of smelting five heats on December 15th. The smelting time per heat was reduced from eight hours to five and a half hours. This is the result of improved operating techniques. In the past, it took one hour to discharge the slag floating on the surface of the molten steel after the raw materials were placed in the furnace. Now, the workers at the Martin furnace workshop have improved the charging procedure, mastered the properties of the raw materials, and can completely eliminate the slag on the surface of the molten steel, thus shortening the smelting time.

    上海钢铁公司一厂马丁炉职工
    改进操作技术创日产五炉的新纪录
    编辑同志：上海钢铁公司第一厂冶炼部马丁炉，在十二月十五日创造了冶炼五炉的新纪录；每炉冶炼时间，从八小时缩短到五小时三十分。这是改进了操作技术的结果。过去把原材料放入炉中，浮在钢水面上的沫渣，需要一小时才能排泄完。现在，马丁炉工场工人，改进了加料程序，掌握了原材料的性能，能使钢水面上的沫渣完全消灭，因而缩短了冶炼时间。顾振武
