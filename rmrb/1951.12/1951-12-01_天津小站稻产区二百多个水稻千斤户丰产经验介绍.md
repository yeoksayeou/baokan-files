The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

In the patriotic bumper harvest movement this year, more than two hundred thousand-jin rice farmers (producing over a thousand jin per mu) emerged in the Xiaozhan area near Tianjin. This is the highest rice yield in Chinese history. In order to summarize and promote these bumper harvest experiences, the Ministry dispatched Wang Zhimin and Mo Dingsen, Deputy Directors of the Grain Production Department, to lead a working group to investigate. The investigation report is published below. It is hoped that the various experiences will be discussed; and that all regions will follow this method to carefully investigate and summarize local typical experiences of bumper harvests, and promote them in order to universally increase the yield per unit area next year.

The Xiaozhan area near Tianjin is a famous rice-producing area in North China. This area has more than 19,000 farming households, more than 94,000 people, and more than 260,000 mu of paddy fields. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, a large-scale production movement was launched, and the yield per unit area of paddy fields increased year by year. In the past, during the rule of Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, the rice yield in this area was only 250 to 350 jin per mu. In the third year after liberation, that is, in 1950, the average rice yield of some villages and mutual aid groups reached 600 to 700 jin. The highest rice yield per mu of Chen Chunshu and other five households reached 1,000 jin. This year, in the patriotic bumper harvest movement, a thousand-jin competition was launched in this area. During the movement, the yield per unit area of more than 200 households reached 1,000 jin. Among them: Liu Changwen, a labor model in Ninghe, created the highest record of 1,400 jin of rice per mu in China; Liu Shude of Zhang Guizhuang and Yutian of Xiaomiao County created a record of 1,300 jin of rice per mu. There were 28 households with a yield of 1,200 jin per mu, 55 households with 1,100 jin, and 114 households with 1,000 jin. There were 20 households of farmers who participated in mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, with a rice yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. Their main experiences in achieving bumper harvests are as follows:

	Apply more fertilizer, and apply it at the right time
    
    1. Sufficient fertilization. Local farmers believe that the main reason for obtaining a bumper rice harvest is sufficient fertilizer. Their experience is: apply as much fertilizer as is needed. Neither too little nor too much. Lack of fertilizer will not achieve high yields; too much fertilizer will also lead to reduced production. At the same time, it is necessary to provide sufficient fertilizer when crops need it most. The method of fertilization should be determined according to soil fertility, rainfall, planting density, and crop growth. Bumper harvest households apply 250 to 300 jin of bean cake and 15 to 20 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu. Those who apply less fertilizer have poor plant growth and greatly reduced production. In fields with poor soil quality or infertile land, more fertilizer is needed. Yang Jinqi had a sandy land that used to yield only 200 to 300 jin per mu without fertilization. In 1950, he applied 450 jin of bean cake, which seemed insufficient; this year, he applied 500 jin of bean cake per mu, and the yield reached over 1,000 jin. The rational fertilization method: apply fertilizer three times within 40 days after transplanting, and stop applying fertilizer after 60 days after transplanting. Because the types of fertilizer are different, the timing and amount of fertilization should also be different. After harrowing the field, Jiang Deyu applied 2,250 jin of dried human manure as base fertilizer; 20 days after transplanting, he applied 140 jin of bean cake as top dressing; after another 15 days, he applied
    20 jin of ammonium sulfate. He said: "Fertilization depends on the weather. Because the rainfall was small this year, I added 20 jin of fertilizer powder at the end. If the rainfall was heavy this year, I would not have used this 20 jin of fertilizer powder." Zou Yubin applied 200 jin of bean cake per mu 7 or 8 days after transplanting, and after 25 or 26 days, when harrowing the seedlings for the second time, he applied 100 jin of bean cake as top dressing; at 37 or 38 days, he applied ammonium sulfate top dressing again, 18 to 25 jin per mu. Rice needs different amounts of fertilizer at each stage of development, so it is necessary to adopt the method of applying fertilizer in stages in order to supply the nutrients needed by the crop in a timely and sufficient manner. The base fertilizer applied before sowing has two functions: one is to cultivate soil fertility, and the other is to supply the nutrients needed by the seedlings from transplantation, seedling revival to tillering. The top dressing applied when harrowing the seedlings for the first time is to supply the nutrients needed by the seedlings from tillering to flowering. This is when rice needs the most fertilizer, so bumper harvest farmers mostly advocate applying all the fertilizer within 40 days. This is completely in line with scientific principles. The specific time for applying top dressing is somewhat different, mainly considering how to make the fertilizer effect continue to catch up with the needs of the crop. The second top dressing should be applied 15 or 16 days after transplanting. Jiang Deyu used dried human manure as base fertilizer, and the fertilizer effect can last longer, so he applied the second fertilizer 20 days after transplanting. Zou Yubin did not apply base fertilizer, but applied the first bean cake 7 or 8 days after transplanting; he applied the second top dressing 25 or 26 days after transplanting; when the third fertilization was applied, it was the time when the rice was flowering and bearing fruit, and the nitrogen fertilizer needed was very small, so he used a small amount of ammonium sulfate to supplement it. The soil in this area lacks nitrogen and organic matter, so it is more rational to combine manure, bean cake and ammonium sulfate and apply them three times. However, in the later stage of rice growth, if the rainfall is too heavy and the temperature drops, the light and heat needed by the rice cannot be fully supplied, and nitrogen fertilizer should not be applied too much. Applying more nitrogen fertilizer under this condition will not only not increase production, but the seedlings will easily lodge, resulting in reduced production. Labor model Wang Guilin has successfully experimented with using *Amorpha fruticosa* (a perennial shrub, which can increase yield and improve soil when used as green manure) as base fertilizer. In 1949, he heard at a meeting of the Bohai Reclamation Bureau that *Amorpha fruticosa* was the best fertilizer. After returning to the village, he began to plant it for application. According to his experience, under the same conditions, rice fertilized with *Amorpha fruticosa* is two or three inches taller than rice fertilized with other fertilizers. Applying 700 jin of *Amorpha fruticosa* per mu can yield 1,300 jin of rice. According to his experiment, the fertilizer effect of 100 jin of *Amorpha fruticosa* is equivalent to 34 jin of bean cake or 15 baskets
    (80 jin per basket) of dried human manure. According to the experiment of Junliangcheng Farm, rice fields continuously applied with *Amorpha fruticosa* for three years increased production by 195 jin per mu in the first year, 249 jin in the second year, and 358 jin in the third year. This situation proves that using *Amorpha fruticosa* as green manure not only has a great fertilizer effect, but also can maintain and increase soil fertility, stabilize and increase yield, which is worth promoting.

    Deep plowing and dense planting to improve cultivation techniques
    
    2. Deep plowing and dense planting. The soil in this area is mostly loose in the surface layer and mostly firm in the lower layer. Therefore, deep plowing has a significant effect on increasing production. In the past, Xiaozhan farmers mostly used hoes to plow the land (hoes can only plow three inches deep), but now more than 50% of the land is plowed with iron shovels or new-style walking plows. Jiang Deyu, a labor model in Qianying, experimented with the different effects of hoeing and plowing. Under the same land and same treatment, rice cultivated by hoeing yielded 890 jin per mu; rice cultivated by plowing yielded 1,100 jin per mu; rice cultivated by new-style walking plows yielded more than 1,200 jin per mu. He believes that deep plowing, turning up the raw soil, has a great effect on washing alkali and rice development; it also greatly helps eliminate weeds. His experience is: deep plowing more than six inches has very few weeds, while plowing only three inches has many weeds. In the Xiaozhan area, the plant spacing and row spacing of indica rice used to be about one foot. After changing to planting Yinbang rice, it was changed to eight or nine inches; in the past two or three years, due to deep plowing and increased fertilization, the plant spacing and row spacing have gradually been changed to six or seven inches. According to the experiment of Junliangcheng Farm, planting 20,000 seedlings per mu, with five seedlings per hill, about 100,000 seedlings per mu, the yield is very high. However, local bumper harvest households plant 15,000 seedlings per mu, with seven or eight seedlings per hill, about 105,000 to 120,000 seedlings, and the yield exceeds the farm. Because each hill plants seven or eight seedlings, each seedling averages one tiller, and each hill can be increased to sixteen or seventeen tillers. This cultivation method has neat panicles, consistent maturity, which can not only increase yield, but also facilitate field work. In cultivation, in addition to deep plowing and dense planting, the most important thing is leveling the land. Li Yujie, a bumper harvest household, emphasized this very much. He said, "If it's deep in one place and shallow in another, it will never grow well." Pay attention to irrigation and drainage

    3. Pay attention to irrigation. Mastering the timing and depth of irrigation has the effect of controlling rice growth. Therefore, alkali washing, irrigation, and drying need to be appropriate. Before transplanting, alkali must be washed first. The first irrigation should be five or six inches deep to submerge the mud and soak it thoroughly. After that, each irrigation should be three or four inches deep. Generally, alkali needs to be washed two or three times. The number of alkali washings in newly reclaimed land should be more. The land in Xinli Village has a high alkali content. Labor model Wang Guilin washes it every ten days after transplanting; after harrowing the seedlings for the second time, he washes it every twenty days. Although fertilizer is lost by doing this, it is better than not washing alkali. In short, the number of alkali washings depends on the salt content of the soil. Too many washings will easily lose the fertilizer stored in the soil; too few washings will not be able to wash the alkali clean. How do you know if the alkali has been washed clean? The local farmers' experience is: as long as the mud doesn't stick to your feet, it means the alkali has been washed well. Secondly, master irrigation techniques. When transplanting, the water should be shallower, as it is inconvenient to plant if it is too deep. After planting, release a lot of water to reduce evaporation from the seedling leaves and promote seedling revival. The depth of the water should be based on the size of the seedlings. Generally, it needs to be irrigated about two inches, but the principle is not to submerge the seedlings. After harrowing the seedlings for the first time, the irrigation should be shallow to promote tillering. After harrowing the seedlings for the second time and applying top dressing, the irrigation depth needs to be increased, preferably to two inches, to prevent ineffective tillering. From tillering to the booting stage, it is the vigorous growth period of rice, and the evaporation is large. Irrigation must be increased to a depth of two to two and a half inches to provide sufficient water. Do not cut off the water during the heading and flowering period. Reduce the water during the yellow ripening period. Stop draining water ten days before harvest.

    The growth of rice is closely related to drainage. Therefore, drainage channels should be smooth. Drainage ditches should be set around the paddy fields. Field drainage ditches are usually set on both sides of each section of land, and irrigation ditches are set in the middle of each section for irrigation in the middle and drainage on both sides. Field drainage ditches should be five inches to one foot deeper than field irrigation ditches, and drainage ditches should be two or three feet deeper than field drainage ditches. This will allow the salt in the field to be drained away with the water. The depth of irrigation is also closely related to weeding. For example, if weeds grow again after harrowing the seedlings, dry the field for one or two days to three or four days before irrigating again, which can inhibit weed growth. In addition, special attention should be paid to removing barnyard grass. According to Liang Fengtong's experience, one barnyard grass can affect four rice seedlings, so barnyard grass should be removed twice fifteen to twenty days after transplanting. The time should not be too early or too late. If it is too early, the rice roots have not yet been established; if it is too late, the barnyard grass will grow vigorously and affect rice growth.

    Select good seeds and cultivate strong seedlings

    4. Seed selection and seedling cultivation. Paying attention to seed selection has a great effect on bumper harvests. Farmers in this area used to have no habit of saving seeds. Even the best improved variety, Yinbang rice, is quite mixed. In the past two years, yield and quality have gradually improved due to the promotion of annual panicle selection. Liang Fengtong in Qianying attaches great importance to seed selection. His rice is completely selected from single panicles, grows particularly neatly, has high yield and good quality. His rice seedlings can all emerge neatly in seven or eight days, maturing a few days earlier than the rice of ordinary households. This year, Ninghe bumper harvest model Liu Changwen selected the "Three Hundred Grain" good rice variety and achieved a bumper harvest of 1,400 jin under good cultivation conditions (Three Hundred Grain is a superior variety selected from Yinbang rice, with an average of about 150 rice grains per panicle, and the most reaching more than 300 grains). Xu Baozhen also selected a "Three Hundred Grain" from Shuiyuan rice. There were only three panicles originally, and after three years of propagation, it can now be planted on 200 mu. The glutinous rice planted by Zou Yu'an in Huangjiaying has tall stalks and large panicles, with a yield per mu exceeding Yinbang rice, with an average of about 200 grains per panicle, and individual panicles having as many as 400 grains.

    Seedling cultivation. Generally, seeds are sown during Grain Rain and seedlings are transplanted during Grain Full. Late rice is sown during the Beginning of Summer and transplanted during芒种(Mangzhong). Seedling fields should be selected in high and sunny places, and windbreaks should be set up during the spring cold. Seedling fields are cultivated with hoes, and hoes can be used to cultivate three inches deep. This way, the seedlings have shallow roots and are easy to pull. The land must be harrowed and raked well after plowing. Seedling fields generally use *kang* soil (that is, fire bed soil bricks) as base fertilizer. Soil bricks from one *kang* can be applied to one mu of land. Because *kang* soil is warm and easy to germinate, and can prevent red threadworm damage, it can also prevent the phenomenon of dry tips on seedlings. Before sowing, it is necessary to carry out seed soaking and Ceresan seed dressing to prevent rice inferior seedling disease (moose seedlings). Germination: Soak in clean water for three days, take out and spread on the ground, cover with sacks, after one night, when the buds are slightly exposed, sow. Seedlings should be slightly sparse. Sow 270 to 280 jin per mu of seedling field. Generally, labor models are good at using fertilization and irrigation methods to control seedling growth and ensure that the seedlings do not exceed six inches high when transplanting. After sowing, put three inches of water to provide the seeds with sufficient moisture and maintain temperature. After four or five days, dry the field during the day to allow the seedlings to get sunlight, and put more than one inch of water at night. If the weather is cold, you can put more water. After that, keep one and a half inches of water and dry it once every three or four days to make the seedling roots and stems strong. Fertilization method: seven or eight days after sowing, apply half a jin of bean cake per jin of seeds. When the seedlings are one inch high, apply half a jin of bean cake per jin of seeds again. When the seedlings are 27 or 28 days old, if the seedlings are found to be weak, apply 20 to 30 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu as top dressing, which can accelerate the germination and help the growth of fibrous roots; it is easy to revive after transplantation. If early seedlings are transplanted late, you can use the method of applying fertilizer late and drying frequently to inhibit their growth.

    The above various bumper harvest factors are interconnected and coordinated. As mentioned earlier, changing to planting Yinbang rice, a good variety, requires sufficient fertilizer. With sufficient fertilizer, it is also necessary to implement deep plowing and dense planting and good technical management to obtain high yields. Therefore, bumper harvest labor models do not relax on any technology. From years of cultivation experience, they have found the law of rice growth and development and created a set of scientific management systems. At each stage of development, they can adopt all measures to control seedling growth. For example, in the seedling stage, the temperature is low, and the light and heat required by rice are insufficient, so they use all heat preservation technologies to promote seedling development and health, and control their growth to a height of six inches. When tillering begins until before booting, it is the vigorous growth period of rice, and the temperature is high, so they adopt the combined operation technology of fertilization, water seedlings, irrigation, and weeding to fully supply the nutrients and water they need, and control the number of tillers. They believe that only when all the bumper harvest factors are brought into play can the yield continue to increase. Because they correctly grasped all the factors needed for rice growth and development at each stage, they were able to actively use all measures to strive for a bumper harvest.

    The bumper harvest of Xiaozhan rice shows
    
    The superiority of the New Democratic system
    
    The emergence of more than two hundred thousand-jin households in the Xiaozhan rice production area of Tianjin shows that increasing the yield per unit area is not just something that a few labor models can do on a small amount of land, but that it is entirely possible to become a mass movement. The fact that the Xiaozhan rice production area has achieved a universal bumper harvest fully demonstrates the superiority of the New Democratic social system. There are three reasons why the yield per unit area can be rapidly increased in this area:

    (1) Before the Anti-Japanese War, the average yield per mu of paddy fields in this area was 256 jin; during the Japanese occupation, the average yield per mu was 350 jin. After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government led farmers to carry out a large-scale production movement, and gave farmers various support in economic and technical aspects, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for production and rapidly increased the yield per unit area. (2) The policy of organizing was implemented. In the past two years, a total of 725 mutual aid groups and 87 cooperative groups have been organized; the fastest growing are agricultural production cooperatives, which have increased more than tenfold compared with last year. After the farmers were "organized," labor efficiency was greatly improved. Zhang Quanchun, a member of the Luo Fuxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinli Village, created the highest record of plowing 20 mu of land per day. This year, the average yield per mu of the land planted by the group reached 1,000 jin, an increase of 450 jin per mu compared with when they were working individually in 1950. This autumn, the group added two more draught animals, a cart, three sections of powered threshers, and developed sideline businesses, raising pigs and ducks, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, promoting the planting of *Amorpha fruticosa*, and continuing to expand the investment in reproduction. (3) The advanced experiences of the masses were concentrated and implemented, and the wisdom and creativity of the masses were fully utilized. Technical research and promotion groups were generally established in mutual aid groups and cooperative groups, and technology was universally improved. For example, the Jiang Deyu Mutual Aid Group uses irrigation expert Guo Pengshun, plowing expert Jiang Baolin, transplanting expert Zhao Xinqiao, pest and disease prevention expert Jiang Deyu, and fertilization expert Zhao Yutian as the core of technical leadership, and uses brainstorming sessions and seminars to gather members for discussion in a timely manner. After making a decision, everyone unanimously implements it, and stipulates a quarterly model reward method to promote the patriotic bumper harvest movement. Now the whole group has generally implemented warm soup seed soaking, unified seedlings are cultivated in one piece of land, alkali washing is unified by a dedicated person, deep plowing, fertilization, transplanting, harrowing, irrigation, weeding, harvesting, etc., can be completed in a timely manner in accordance with technical requirements.

    Can continue to improve one step
    
    According to the current situation analysis, it is very possible to further improve the yield per unit area in this area on the existing basis. (1) Local rice has diseases such as rice blast and moose seedlings, as well as pests such as rice stem borers and rice leaf rollers. If they are thoroughly controlled, production can be increased. (2) Although Yinbang rice is a good variety, it is quite mixed. If annual panicle selection is implemented to improve the variety, yield and quality can be improved. (3) At present, most bumper harvest households adopt the method of combining bean cake and chemical fertilizers. If *Amorpha fruticosa* can be universally promoted and *Amorpha fruticosa*, bean cake, and ammonium sulfate are combined and applied, the yield can be increased year by year. (4) In terms of deep plowing, farmers now mostly use iron shovels to plow the land in spring, lacking the habit of autumn plowing. If the masses are mobilized to jointly purchase draught animals and new-style walking plows to improve farming methods, the yield can also be improved. In fact, local farmers are not satisfied with their existing achievements, and many thousand-jin households have proposed a 1,500-jin plan as the goal for next year. (Attached pictures)

    Zou Yubin, the leader of the Huangjiaying Thousand-Jin Group in Xiaozhan, Tianjin County, is observing the rice he planted.

    Appropriate dense planting is one of the main methods to increase the yield per unit area. This is the situation when the comrades of the Bohai Reclamation Bureau and Zou Yubin, the leader of the Huangjiaying Thousand-Jin Group in Xiaozhan, Tianjin County, measured the plant spacing and row spacing in the paddy field.

    Timely and appropriate phased fertilization is one of the main experiences of Zou Yubin, the leader of the Huangjiaying Thousand-Jin Group in Xiaozhan, Tianjin County, in achieving a bumper harvest. This is the situation when the comrades of the Bohai Reclamation Bureau who study rice and Zou Yubin measured the height of the rice.

    天津小站稻产区二百多个水稻千斤户丰产经验介绍
    中央人民政府农业部
    天津附近小站一带，在今年的爱国丰产运动中，出现了二百余户水稻千斤户（每亩产量千斤以上），这是我国历史上水稻的最高产量。为总结与推广这些丰产经验，本部特派粮食生产司副司长王志民、莫定森，率领工作组前往调查。兹将调查报告发表如下。其中各项经验希望展开讨论；并望各地区都仿照这样的办法，仔细地调查与总结当地的丰产典型经验，加以推广以便在明年普遍的提高单位面积产量。
    天津小站一带，为华北著名的稻米产区。这一带共有一万九千余农户，九万四千余人，二十六万余亩稻田。解放以后，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，开展了大生产运动，稻田单位面积产量逐年提高。在过去日寇和国民党统治时期，这一带水稻，每亩产量仅二百五十斤到三百五十斤。解放后的第三年，即一九五○年，有些村和互助组的水稻产量，平均已达六、七百斤。陈春述等五户，每亩水稻最高产量达到了一千斤。今年在爱国丰产运动中，这一带又发动了千斤竞赛运动。在运动中，有二百多户的单位面积产量达到了一千斤。其中：宁河劳动模范刘长文，创造了我国水稻每亩丰产一千四百斤的最高纪录：张贵庄刘树德、小苗县玉田创造了每亩产稻一千三百斤的纪录。每亩产量一千二百斤的有二十八户，一千一百斤的有五十五户，一千斤的有一百一十四户。参加互助组、生产合作组的农民，每亩产水稻一千斤以上的，就有二十户。他们获得丰产的主要经验有如下各项：
    要多施肥，而且要施在火候上
    1、施肥充足。当地农民认为获得水稻丰产的主要原因是肥料充足。他们的经验是：应施多少肥料，就施多少肥料。既不过少，也不过多。肥料缺少，不能达到高产量；肥料过多，也会招致减产。同时，要在作物最需要施肥的时候，予以充分供给。施肥办法，要看土壤肥瘠，雨量大小，栽植密度和作物生长状况来决定。丰产户每亩地施豆饼二百五十斤到三百斤，硫酸铔十五斤到二十斤。施肥少的，植株生长不良，减产颇多。在土质较差或地力瘠薄的田中，需多施肥料。杨金起有一块沙土地，过去不施肥，每亩只收二、三百斤。一九五○年施豆饼四百五十斤，看样子还不够充足；今年每亩施豆饼五百斤，产量达到一千斤以上。合理的施肥方法：在栽秧后四十天之内，分三次施肥，在栽秧六十天后，即不能再施肥。因为肥料种类不同，所以施肥时期和数量也应有不同。姜德玉在耖地后，施用二千二百五十斤人粪干做基肥；栽秧后二十天，施用一百四十斤豆饼做追肥；再过十五天，又施用
    二十斤硫酸铔。他说：“施肥要看天气，因为今年雨水小，所以末后又上了二十斤肥田粉。如果今年雨水大，我这二十斤肥田粉就用不上了。”邹玉彬在栽秧七、八天后，每亩施二百斤豆饼，过二十五、六天，挠二遍秧时，施用一百斤豆饼做追肥；在三十七、八天，又上了一次硫酸铔追肥，每亩十八斤至二十五斤。水稻在各个发育阶段，需要不同数量的肥料，所以必须采取分期施肥的方法，才能适时、充分供给作物需要的养料。播种前所施基肥，有两个作用：一是培育地力，一是供给秧苗从移植、还苗到分蘖前所需用的养料。挠第一遍秧时所施追肥，是为了供给秧苗从分蘖到开花前需用的养料。这是水稻最需要肥料的时候，所以丰产农民多主张在四十天以内，把肥料全部施上。这是完全合乎科学道理的。施用追肥的具体时间所以有些区别，主要是考虑如何使肥效能继续赶上作物的需要。第二次追肥，以插秧后十五、六天施用为宜。姜德玉用人粪干做基肥，肥效可以持久一些，所以他在插秧后二十天才施第二次肥料。邹玉彬没有施基肥，而在插秧后七、八天，施了第一次豆饼；在插秧二十五、六天后，施了第二次追肥；第三次施肥时，正值水稻开花结实，所需氮肥很少，所以用了少量硫酸铔来补充。这一带的土壤中，缺乏氮素和有机质，所以把粪肥、豆饼和硫酸铔配合起来，分三次施用，是比较合理的。但在水稻生育后期，如果雨量太大，气温降低，水稻所需要的光热不能充分供应，氮素肥料就不能多施。在这种情况下多施氮肥，不但不能增产，株苗反而容易倒伏，以至减产。劳动模范王桂林用紫穗槐（紫穗槐为一种多年生灌木，用做绿肥可以增加产量，改良土壤）做基肥，已经试验成功。一九四九年，他在渤海区农垦管理局开会时，听说紫穗槐是最好的肥料。回村以后，他便开始栽植，以便施用紫穗槐。根据他的经验，在各种条件相同的情况下，施用紫穗槐的水稻，比施用其他肥料的水稻，植株高出二、三寸。每亩施用七百斤紫穗槐，即可收稻谷一千三百斤。根据他的试验，一百斤紫穗槐的肥效，等于三十四斤豆饼或十五筐
    （每筐八十斤）人粪干的肥效。又据军粮城农场试验：水稻地连续三年施用紫穗槐，第一年每亩增产一百九十五斤，第二年增产二百四十九斤，第三年增产三百五十八斤。这种情况证明，用紫穗槐做绿肥，不但肥效大，并且可以保持与增加地力，稳定并提高产量，值得提倡。
        深耕密植，改进栽培技术
    2、深耕密植。这一带土壤，表层多疏松，下层多坚实。因此，深耕对于增产的效果很显著。过去小站农民多用耠子耕地（按耠子耕地只能耕三寸深），现在已有百分之五十以上的土地，用铁锨翻地或用新式步犁耕地。前营劳动模范姜德玉，曾试验了耠地和耕地的不同效果。在同样土地、同样待遇下，用耠地办法培植的水稻，每亩产八百九十斤；用翻地办法培植的水稻，每亩产一千一百斤；用新式步犁耕地的水稻，每亩产一千二百斤以上。他认为，实行深耕，把生土翻上来，对于洗碱及水稻发育，有很大作用；对于消灭杂草，也有很大帮助。他的经验是：深耕六寸以上，就很少有杂草，而只耕三寸的，杂草就很多。小站一带过去种的籼稻，株行距为一尺左右，自改种银坊稻后，改为八、九寸；最近二、三年来，由于深耕和增加施肥的关系，株行距又逐渐改为六、七寸。据军粮城农场试验：每亩栽秧二万墩，每墩五株，每亩约合十万株，产量很高。但当地丰产户每亩栽秧一万五千墩，每墩七、八株，约合十万零五千株至十二万株，产量则超过农场。因为每墩植七、八株，每株平均发一个杈子，每墩可增殖至十六、七株或十七、八株。这种栽培方法，穗头整齐，成熟一致，产量既可提高，又便于田间工作。在耕作栽培中，除深耕密植外，最重要的是平地工作。丰产户李玉阶很强调这一点。他说：“深一片，浅一片，什么时候也长不好。”讲究灌溉、注意排水
    3、讲究灌溉。掌握灌水时期和灌水深浅，有控制水稻生长的作用。因此，洗碱、灌水、落干都需适当。在插秧前，首先要洗碱。头一次灌水，深可五、六寸，要淹没泥块，并需浸透。以后每次灌水，深三、四寸。一般要洗碱二、三次，新开荒地的洗碱次数，要更多一些。新立村的土地含碱量较多，劳动模范王桂林在插秧后，隔十天洗一次；挠二遍秧后，隔二十天洗一次。这样作，肥料虽然流失一些，但比不洗碱还好。总之，洗碱次数要看土壤盐分而定。次数太多，土壤中蓄存的肥料容易流失；次数太少，不能把碱洗净。怎样才算把碱洗净呢？当地农民的经验是：只要泥不粘脚，就表示洗好碱了。其次，掌握灌水技术。在插秧时，水要浅一些，过深即不便栽植。栽好后，要放大水，以减少秧苗叶面蒸发，促进还苗。水的深度以秧的大小为准。普通须灌水二寸左右，但以不淹没秧苗为原则。在挠第一次秧以后，灌水要浅，以促进分蘖。在挠第二遍秧并施追肥以后，需增加灌水深度，最好增到二寸，以阻止无效分蘖。自分蘖至孕穗前，是水稻发育旺盛时期，蒸发量较大，必须增加灌水，要有二寸至二寸半深，以供给足够的水分。在抽穗开花期，千万不要断水。至黄熟期应放小水。在收获前十余日，即停止放水。
    水稻生长情况，与排水有极大关系。因此，排水渠道要通畅。排水干沟，应设于水田外围。田间排水沟通常设于每段地两侧，引水沟设于每地段的中部，中间引水，两面排水。田间排水沟应比田间引水沟深五寸至一尺，排水干沟比田间排水沟要加深二、三尺。这样才能使田间盐分随水排掉。灌水深浅和除草也有很大关系。如挠秧后杂草再生，要落干一、二日至三、四日再灌水，这样可以抑制杂草生长。此外，要特别注意拔除稗子。根据梁凤桐的经验一株稗子可以影响四墩稻苗，故在插秧后十五天至二十天，要拔稗子二次。时间不能过早，也不能过迟。过早稻根还没有扎好，过迟则稗子发育旺盛，影响水稻生长。
        选用良种，培育壮秧
    4、选种育秧。注意选种，对丰产有很大作用。这一带地区的农民，过去没有留种习惯。以最好的改良种银坊稻来说，也已相当混杂。近两年来由于提倡连年穗选，才逐渐提高了产量和品质。前营梁凤桐对选种非常重视，他的稻子完全由单穗选出，长的特别整齐，产量高，品质好。他的稻秧，在七、八天内能全部抽齐，比一般户的稻子早熟几天。今年宁河丰产模范刘长文选用了“三百粒”良种稻，在良好的耕作条件下，获得了一千四百斤的丰收（三百粒系从银坊稻中选出的优良品种，每穗平均有稻粒一百五十粒左右，最多的达三百粒以上）。徐宝珍从水原稻中也选出一个“三百粒”，原来只有三个穗子，经过三年繁殖，现在已可栽二百亩了。黄家营邹玉安所种的糯稻，秸高穗大，每亩产量超过银坊稻，每穗平均有二百粒左右，个别有多至四百粒的。
    培育秧苗。一般在谷雨播种，小满栽秧。晚稻是立夏播种，芒种插秧。秧田应选择高亢向阳的地方，在春寒时，应插风障。秧田耕地用耠子，耠三寸深即可。这样幼苗根浅，容易拔秧。耕地后一定要耖平耙好。秧田一般以炕土（即火炕土坯）做基肥，一个炕的土坯可以施一亩地。因炕土性暖，易于发苗，且能防治红线虫为害，也能防止幼苗干尖的现象。播种前要实行浸种和赛力散拌种，防止稻劣秧病（马鹿苗）。催芽：先在清水中浸三日，捞出摊在地上，盖以麻袋，一夜后，微露芽尖，即可播种。秧苗以稍稀为佳。每亩秧田播种二百七十斤到二百八十斤。一般劳动模范均善于用施肥和灌水方法来控制秧苗生长，保证到栽秧时，秧苗不超过六寸高。播种后要放三寸深水，以供给种子充足水分及保持温度。四、五天后白天要落干，使幼芽得到日照，晚上放一寸多深的水。若天气较冷，可多放一些水。此后，保持寸半深水，三、四天落干一次，使秧苗根茎粗壮。施肥方法：在播种后七八日，每斤种子使豆饼半斤。在苗高一寸时，再按每斤种子施豆饼半斤。在二十七、八天的时候，如发现秧苗较弱，每亩补施硫酸铔二十斤至三十斤做追肥，这样可以加速催苗，帮助须根生长；移植后便于还苗。如早秧晚栽，可用晚施肥、勤落干的办法，抑止其生长。
    以上各种丰产因素，都是互相连系、互相配合的。如前所说，改种银坊稻良种，就必须有充足的肥料。有了充足的肥料，还必须实行深耕密植和良好的技术管理，才能获得高额的产量。所以，丰产劳动模范对于每一样技术都不放松。他们从多年的栽培经验中，找到了水稻生长和发育的规律，创造了一套科学的管理制度。在每一个发育阶段，均能采用一切措施，控制秧苗生长。如在育秧阶段，气温较低，水稻所需光、热不够，他们就运用一切保温的技术，以促进秧苗发育健壮，并控制其生长到六寸高的程度。到了开始分蘖至打苞前，正是挠稻生长旺盛时期，气温较高，他们便采取施肥、水秧、灌水、拔草等联合操作的技术，以充分供给其需要的养料和水分，并控制其分蘖的数目。他们认为只有使全部丰产因素都发挥作用，产量才能不断提高。因为他们正确地掌握了各个阶段水稻生长发育中所需要的一切因素，所以就能够经常主动地运用一切措施，争取丰收。
        小站水稻丰产成绩，显示了
    新民主主义制度的优越性
    天津小站稻产区二百多个千斤户的出现，说明了提高单位面积产量，绝不只是少数劳动模范在少量土地上所能作到的，而是完全可能成为群众性的运动的。小站稻产区普遍丰产的事实，充分显示了新民主主义社会制度的优越性。这一带地区能够迅速提高单位面积产量，有以下三个原因：
    （一）抗日战争以前，这一带稻田每亩平均产量二百五十六斤；日寇侵占时期，每亩平均产量三百五十斤。解放后，由于共产党和人民政府领导农民开展了大生产运动，在经济、技术方面，给予农民各种支持，因而大大地鼓舞了群众生产积极性，迅速提高了单位面积产量。（二）贯彻了组织起来的方针。二年来共组织互助组七百二十五个，合作组八十七个；发展最快的是农业生产合作组，约比去年增加十倍以上。农民“组织起来”之后，劳动效率大大提高了。新立村罗福祥农业生产合作组组员张全春，创造了每天耙地二十亩的最高纪录。今年该组所种田地，每亩平均产量达到一千斤，较一九五○年单干时每亩增产四百五十斤。今年秋后，该组又添置役畜两头，大车一辆，动力脱粒机三节，并发展副业，养猪、养鸭，大量积肥，推广种紫穗槐，继续扩大再生产投资。（三）集中并贯彻了群众中的先进经验，充分发挥了群众的智慧和创造，在互助组和合作组内，普遍建立了技术研究推广组，普遍提高了技术。如姜德玉互助组，以灌溉能手郭鹏顺、扶犁能手姜宝林、插秧能手赵欣桥、防治病虫害的能手姜德玉、施肥能手赵玉田等人为技术领导核心，利用碰头会和座谈会的方式，及时召集组员进行研讨，做出决定后，大家一致推行，并规定四季评选模范奖励办法，推进爱国丰产运动。现全组已普遍实行温汤浸种，秧苗统一在一块地里培育，洗碱统一由专人负责，深耕、施肥、栽秧、挠秧、灌水、除草、收割等，都能按照技术要求及时完成。
        还可继续提高一步
    根据目前情况分析，这一带地区单位面积产量，在现有基础上再提高一步，还有很大可能。（一）当地的水稻有稻热病，马鹿苗等病害，亦有二化螟、稻苞虫等虫害，如果彻底加以防治，还可增产。（二）银坊稻虽然是优良品种，但已相当混杂，如实行连年穗选，改良品种，还可提高产量及品质。（三）目前一般丰产户多采用兼施豆饼和化学肥料的办法，如能普遍推广紫穗槐，把紫穗槐、豆饼、硫酸铔配合起来施用，产量还可以逐年提高。（四）在深耕方面，现在农民多在春季采用铁锨翻地的办法，缺乏秋耕习惯，如发动群众合伙购买耕畜和新式步犁，改进耕种方法，产量也还可提高。事实上当地农民并不满足他们已有的成就，有不少千斤户已提出一千五百斤的计划，作为明年奋斗的目标。（附图片）
