    Our Great Motherland
    The first of the documentary films "Resist America, Aid Korea" will be screened in forty-four major cities, factories, troops, and rural areas across the country starting today. This film faithfully reflects the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers and is an extremely valuable work of art. This is a shot of Comrade Yang Xuzhong, the photographer who gave his life for this film, shooting the film at the front line.
