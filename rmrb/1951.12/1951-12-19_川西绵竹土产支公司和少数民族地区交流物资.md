    Mianzhu Native Products Branch Company, Western Sichuan,
    Exchanges Goods with Minority Areas
    To the Editor: During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, feudal despots and bandits set up checkpoints at the key passes between Mianzhu and Maoxian in western Sichuan, frequently robbing, extorting, and massacring minority brothers and traveling merchants. In addition, the frequent devaluation of counterfeit currency seriously affected the development of trade in the area, and many merchants stopped or changed their businesses for fear of being robbed or killed. After the liberation of Sichuan, the local social order became increasingly stable after various mass movements. In order to help ethnic minorities develop production and prosper the economy, the Mianzhu County Branch of the China Native Produce Company, with the strong help of the Mianzhu County, District, and Township People's Governments, mobilized laborers on September 28th to cross mountains and transport a large number of materials to the ethnic minority areas of Maoxian. As of October 27th, the following had been transported: 254,970 catties of rice, 17,820 catties of wine, 24 cases of cigarettes, and 1,964 bolts of cloth. In addition to exporting large quantities of native products such as medicinal materials, animal skins, prickly ash, and musk, the ethnic minority brothers in Maoxian also exported 17,988 catties of wool. This has also driven private merchants. At present, organized private merchants have jointly operated a Mian (zhu) Mao (xian) mule transport station with the Mianzhu Native Products Branch Company. Now the exchange of materials between the two places is becoming increasingly active, and ethnic minority brothers can be seen at any time driving mule carts loaded with wool or other native products to Mianzhu county towns and villages for trading. The ethnic minority brothers said: "Only when the Communist Party and Chairman Mao come can we be liberated, able to freely buy and sell things that could not be bought and sold for thirty years, and meet relatives we have been separated from for a long time."　Xu Zhongwen

    川西绵竹土产支公司
    和少数民族地区交流物资
    编辑同志：国民党反动派统治时期，封建恶霸和土匪在四川西部绵竹、茂县之间的要口上设立关卡，对少数民族弟兄和来往商人经常进行抢劫、勒索和屠杀。再加上伪币经常贬值，因而严重地影响了这个地区贸易的发展，不少商人也因怕被抢劫和杀害而纷纷停业或转业。四川解放后，经过各种群众运动，当地社会秩序日趋安定。中国土产公司绵竹县支公司为了帮助少数民族发展生产，繁荣经济，在绵竹县、区、乡人民政府的大力帮助下，九月二十八日动员民工翻山越岭，背、挑大批物资前往茂县少数民族地区。到十月二十七日止，计已运去：大米二十五万四千九百七十斤，酒一万七千八百二十斤，纸烟二十四箱，布一千九百六十四匹。茂县兄弟民族除大量输出药材、兽皮、花椒、麝香等土产外，并输出羊毛一万七千九百八十八斤。这样一来，也带动了私商。目前有组织的私商已和绵竹土产支公司合营了一个绵（竹）茂（县）骡运站。现在两地物资交流已日趋活跃，随时都可看见少数民族弟兄赶着骡车装运羊毛或其它土产来绵竹县城、乡进行交易。少数民族弟兄们说：“只有共产党毛主席来了，我们才能得到解放，能自由买卖三十年来所不能买卖的东西，并会见了阔别已久的亲人。”　徐钟文
