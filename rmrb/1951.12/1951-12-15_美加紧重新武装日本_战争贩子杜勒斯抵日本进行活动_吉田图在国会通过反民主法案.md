Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: Following Dodge, Rusk and others, the warmonger Dulles arrived in Tokyo from the United States on the 10th. According to a TASS report on the 12th: Tokyo media sources pointed out regarding the arrival of US State Department Advisor Dulles in Japan: Dulles's trip is related to the rearmament of Japan. Therefore, Tokyo Radio predicted that Dulles would demand Japan to rearm more actively. At the same time, judging from news from Tokyo, Dulles's mission is not only to rearm Japan according to the scale planned by the United States, but also to suppress the movement against rearmament within Japan. It is no coincidence that Dulles first emphasized the stability of the domestic situation in Japan when he held a press conference in Tokyo. As everyone knows, what American warmongers mean by stabilizing the domestic situation is to suppress every action resisting American plans in the countries under their rule.

Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: According to a Dentsu News Agency report from Washington on the 11th: US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Rusk, in his report to the State Department after returning to the United States from Japan and before submitting his resignation, largely discussed the serious opposition to the US-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan. Rusk reported to the State Department that in Japan, not only public opinion, but also a large number of Diet members opposed the "Security Treaty," especially the parts stipulating the stationing of American armed forces in Japan and the increase of Japanese military equipment.

Rusk reported that Ridgway Headquarters has ample evidence that the vast majority of the Japanese people firmly believe that neither now nor in the future is anyone threatening Japan's security, and that only increasing Japan's military equipment will endanger peace. Rusk concluded that this is the basic belief of the majority of the Japanese people. He also said that even prominent Japanese figures and Diet members believe that the "Security Treaty" and the expansion of armaments it brings are extremely detrimental to Japan's national interests.

Rusk pointed out in his report that under these circumstances, even prominent figures in Japanese political circles believe it is difficult to conduct effective propaganda among the broad masses of the people to ask them to recognize the necessity of close US-Japan military cooperation.

Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: Tokyo News: The 13th session of the Japanese Diet opened in Tokyo on the 10th. The Yoshida government is attempting to pass during this Diet session some reactionary bills that failed to be submitted to the Diet during the recently concluded previous session due to opposition from the Japanese people, including bills on amending and abolishing laws formulated in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Proclamation, bills amending laws related to the dissolution of Japanese financial cliques, the "Revised Labor Standards Law Bill" which deprives Japanese workers of democratic rights, and the "Organizations Regulation Ordinance Bill" which suppresses democratic groups. The Yoshida government is also attempting to require this Diet session to pass the 1952 budget, which serves the American aggression policy.

According to TASS, Tokyo sources point out that the purpose of the Yoshida government's attempt to pass all these bills is to make it easier for Japanese reactionaries to restore Japanese militarism and further suppress democracy and freedom.

    美加紧重新武装日本
    战争贩子杜勒斯抵日本进行活动
    吉田图在国会通过反民主法案
    【新华社十四日讯】继道奇、鲁斯克等人之后，战争贩子杜勒斯在十日又从美国抵达东京。据塔斯社十二日消息：东京新闻界人士就美国国务院顾问杜勒斯抵达日本一事指出：杜勒斯此行和重新武装日本有关。因此，东京电台预测，杜勒斯将要求日本更积极地重新武装起来。同时，从东京消息来判断，杜勒斯的使命不仅在于按照美国所计划的规模重新武装日本，而且要把日本境内反对重新武装的运动镇压下去。杜勒斯在东京举行招待记者会时首先强调日本国内形势的稳定，这不是偶然的。大家知道，美国战争贩子们所说的稳定国内形势，意思就是要镇压在他们统治下的国家里面的每一个反抗美国计划的行动。
    【新华社十四日讯】据电通社华盛顿十一日讯：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿鲁斯克在自日本返美后和在向国务院提出辞呈以前所作的报告，很大一部分谈到美日“安全条约”在日本所遭受到的严重反对。鲁斯克向国务院报告说：在日本，不仅是舆论，就是国会里也有一大批议员反对“安全条约”，特别是其中规定美国武装部队留驻日本和增加日本军备的部分。
    鲁斯克报告说：李奇微总部有充分证据表明，广大的日本人民深信：不论现在或将来，都没有人在威胁日本的安全，只有增加日本军备才会危害和平。鲁斯克得出结论说：这是大多数日本人民的基本信念。他又说：甚至日本的知名人士和议员也认为“安全条约”和它所带来的扩张军备对日本的民族利益极有损害。
    鲁斯克在他的报告里指出：在这种情况下，甚至日本政界显要人士也认为很难在广大的人民群众中进行有效的宣传，要求他们承认紧密的美日军事合作的必要。
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本第十三届国会会议十日在东京开幕。吉田政府企图在本届国会会议中通过在不久以前结束的上届国会会议中因为遭到日本人民的反对而未能向国会提出的一些反动法案，其中包括关于修改和废除依照波茨坦公告原则而制订的法令的法案、修改有关解散日本财阀的法令的法案、剥夺日本工人民主权利的“修改劳工法规法案”以及镇压民主团体的“团体等规正法令案”等。吉田政府也企图要求本届国会会议通过为美国侵略政策服务的一九五二年度预算案。
    据塔斯社称，东京人士指出：吉田政府企图通过所有这些法案的目的，都是要使日本反动派能更容易地恢复日本军国主义和进一步压制民主自由。
