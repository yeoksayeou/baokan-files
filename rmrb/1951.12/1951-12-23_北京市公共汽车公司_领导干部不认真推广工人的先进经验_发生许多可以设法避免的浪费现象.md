Beijing Public Transportation Company
Leaders Fail to Seriously Promote Workers' Advanced Experience
Resulting in Many Avoidable Wasteful Phenomena

The leading cadres of the Beijing Public Transportation Company have not seriously promoted advanced experience and do not value the rationalization proposals of the workers. Since the democratic reform carried out by the company in August this year, the Party committee has frequently conducted political education among the employees, and the political consciousness of all employees has continuously improved. In late October, the Party, administration, and trade union, with increased production and frugality as the central content, led the employees in revising the patriotic convention. Under the slogan of "saving raw materials, utilizing waste materials, and creating wealth for the country," the employees actively took action. By the end of November, the amount of increased production and frugality had exceeded 600 million yuan. However, because the leading cadres did not seriously promote advanced work experience and did not value the rationalization suggestions of the workers, the movement to increase production and practice frugality could not be carried out comprehensively and in depth. According to the statistics of Route 1, Route 2, and suburban routes of the company's First Maintenance Depot, there were a total of 471 vehicle failures in November, wasting 447 hours and 5 minutes of driving time; among them, 315 failures occurred due to poor coal stove technology and poor filter cleaning, wasting 292 hours and 14 minutes of driving time. According to statistics, from March to October, each vehicle stopped for 15 minutes due to failure for every 100 kilometers traveled.

On the other hand, the Zhang Jutao group of suburban bus number 89 had very good experience in reducing vehicle failures. They regularized their daily work, arranged work time in a step-by-step and orderly manner, and had advanced experience in the use of coal stove technology and filter cleaning. Therefore, from March to October, this group only stopped for 1 minute and 18 seconds on average per 100 kilometers. In addition, the Li Qichang group of bus number 93 eliminated failures in November. In the past, although the company's leading cadres had rewarded these advanced groups, held seminars, and called on everyone to learn from them, they did not systematically summarize their experience, did not seriously organize everyone to learn, and did not promote it in a planned and step-by-step manner. After the seminar was over, the matter was also over. Therefore, many workers who wanted to make progress had the feeling of "not knowing where to start learning."

There are also many shortcomings in the company's labor organization. Workers have made many suggestions and methods, but they have not been valued by the leading cadres; workers feel that "it is useless to make rationalization proposals." Many rationalization proposals that could increase driving time have not been adopted.

Why do the leading cadres of this company not seriously promote advanced work experience and not value the workers' rationalization proposals? This is because they do not deeply understand the production situation and do not know the significance of advanced experience in production. When they called on everyone to learn from the experience of bus number 89, some workers said: "Who doesn't know this? Their achievements are because the car is good and the maintenance team helps them." The leading cadres not only did not correct this conservative thinking, but instead accommodated this thinking and said: "The main thing is to call on everyone to think of their own methods and learn their spirit." In essence, they negated the advanced experience of the workers. They want to complete the task, but they do not understand the production situation, so they do not value the rationalization proposals that are very helpful for completing the task. For example, the route leader of Route 1 suggested reducing the stopping time of buses at both ends of the route, and reducing the interval time between each bus from eight minutes to seven or six minutes, which could reduce engine oil, reduce accidents (the longer the car stops in the middle, the more likely it is to fail), and facilitate passengers. However, the leading cadres did not adopt it because they were afraid that after increasing the driving time, the average fare per 100 kilometers would be reduced and the task would not be completed. In fact, the more driving time is increased, the more likely it is to complete the task. Their failure to adopt opinions for improving production is due to conservative thinking. (Ning Yuan Tao)

    北京市公共汽车公司
    领导干部不认真推广工人的先进经验
    发生许多可以设法避免的浪费现象
    北京市公共汽车公司的领导干部没有认真推广先进经验，不重视工人群众的合理化建议。这个公司今年八月份进行民主改革以后，党委经常在职工中进行政治教育，全体职工的政治觉悟不断提高。十月下旬，党、行政、工会以增产节约为中心内容，领导职工修订了爱国公约。职工们在“节省原料，利用废料，为国家创造财富”的口号下，积极地行动起来，到十一月底止，增产节约数字已有六亿元以上。但是，由于领导干部没有认真地推广先进工作经验，不重视工人群众的合理化建议，增产节约运动就不能全面而深入地开展。根据这个公司第一保养场一路、二路、郊区各路的统计，十一月份汽车发生故障共四百七十一次，浪费行车时间四百四十七小时零五分钟；其中因使用煤炉技术不好和滤清工作做得不好而发生故障的有三百十五次，浪费行车时间二百九十二小时零十四分钟。据统计，从三月到十月，平均每辆车走一百公里就因故障停车十五分钟。
    另一方面，郊区八九号车张菊涛小组在减少汽车故障方面却有着很好的经验。他们把每天经常的工作规律化，有步骤有秩序地安排工作时间，在使用煤炉的技术和滤清工作方面都有先进的经验。所以，这个小组从三月到十月，平均每走百公里只停车一分十八秒钟。另外，九三号汽车李其昌小组在十一月份已经消灭了故障。过去，公司的领导干部虽然曾奖励过这些先进的小组，曾经举行过座谈会，并号召大家向他们学习，但是，没有系统地总结他们的经验，没有认真地组织大家学习，没有有计划有步骤地推广。座谈会完了，事情也就完了。所以，许多要求进步的工人都有“不知道从那里学起”的感觉。
    这个公司在劳动组织上也有很多缺点。工人们曾提过很多意见和办法，都没有被领导干部重视；工人们感到“提合理化建议没有用”。很多合理化建议，都是可以增加行车时间的，也没有被采纳。
    为什么这个公司的领导干部不认真推广先进工作经验、不重视工人的合理化建议呢？这是因为他们不深入了解生产情况，不知道先进经验在生产上的意义的缘故。他们号召大家学习八九号车的经验时，有的工人说：“谁不知道这一套？他们的成绩是因为车子好，保养组对他们有帮助。”领导干部不仅不纠正这种保守思想，反而迁就这种思想说：“主要是号召大家自己想办法，学习他们的精神。”实质上，他们是否定了工人的先进经验。他们想完成任务，但不了解生产情况，因而对于那些对完成任务很有帮助的合理化建议不重视。像一路路长建议减少汽车在路线两端的停车时间，把每辆车开出的间隔时间由八分钟减到七分或六分钟，可以减少机油，减少事故（汽车在中间停得越久，越容易发生故障），便利乘客。但领导干部没有采纳，因为他们怕增加行车时间后，每百公里的平均票款减少，完不成任务。实际上，越增加行车时间，越能完成任务。他们不采纳改进生产的意见，是保守思想在作怪。（宁源涛）
