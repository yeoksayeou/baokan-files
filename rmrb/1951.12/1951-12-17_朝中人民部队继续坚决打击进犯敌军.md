	Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th. Our front-line reporter reports: In addition to carrying out bloody massacres of the people in southern Korea and intensifying their attacks on the heroic and unyielding people's guerrillas, the American invading army and the Li puppet army continue to attack our army's positions with forces ranging from a platoon to a company on all fronts. Our army continues to resolutely打击 attack the invading enemy forces.
	
	On the western front, on the 7th, more than 200 enemy troops, aboard nine wooden boats, attempted to cross the river and invade Taohyun on the north bank of the Han River under the cover of artillery fire. Our army repelled several enemy incursions in succession, killing or wounding more than 40 enemy troops. At 8:00 a.m. that day, two platoons of enemy troops attacked a high ground three kilometers south of Wutingli, but were also repelled by our army's guarding troops.

	On the central front, on the 6th, a company of American invading troops attacked our army's outpost position northwest of Songshili, southeast of Kimhwa, many times, but was repelled by our army, with dozens of enemy casualties. On the 7th, when a company of American invading troops sneaked near Kimhwa, a squad of the enemy's advance troops was completely annihilated by our ambush troops. At 8:00 a.m. that day, enemy troops again used two companies to attack our army's positions on nameless high grounds east of Kimhwa and near Kho-ri respectively, but were repelled, with more than 20 enemy killed or wounded. On the 10th, a company of enemy troops again attacked a certain high ground north of Cheorwon, but was also repelled by our army.

	On the eastern front, on the 6th, two platoons of enemy troops attacked a nameless high ground on the east bank of the Bukhan River, but were forced to retreat southward after our army killed or wounded 16 of them.

	In the western part of the central front, on the night of the 8th, our army used a small number of troops to counterattack Hill 391 northeast of Cheorwon, and recovered this position in only one hour of fighting, killing or wounding more than 70 enemy troops.
