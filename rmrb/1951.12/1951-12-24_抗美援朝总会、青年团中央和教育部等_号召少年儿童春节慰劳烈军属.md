    Call on Children to Comfort Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel during the Spring Festival
[Our Newspaper] The China Anti-American and Aid Korea Headquarters, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and the Broadcasting Bureau of the News Administration of the Central People's Government, in order to launch a movement for children nationwide to comfort the families of martyrs and military personnel during the Spring Festival, issued a letter to children across the country on the 22nd. The original letter is as follows: Dear children across the country:
    The joyous Spring Festival is approaching. We hope that during the Spring Festival, you will work hard to do one thing: comfort the families of our revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary military personnel.
    Children: You all know that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our motherland is becoming stronger and stronger, and our lives are becoming happier and happier. The upcoming Spring Festival will surely be happier than in previous years. At this time, we will naturally think of who created such a happy life for us, and who is protecting our happy life. We will naturally think of the revolutionary martyrs, the People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Children, how should we thank them? How should we comfort them and support them?
    Children: There are many things you can do. Now we only ask you to work hard to do one thing during the Spring Festival, which is to comfort the families of our revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary military personnel. You should organize yourselves, either as a group or as a team. In addition to wishing the families of martyrs and military personnel a happy new year, you should also think of ways together to investigate what difficulties they have and what needs they have for help. Then, pick the things you can do and do them well for them. You should at least do one thing well for them. In this way, you will not only comfort the families of martyrs and the families of military personnel, but also encourage the soldiers of our People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    Children: You are all patriotic children, and we believe you will do this well. If you have any difficulties, you can ask the local Anti-American and Aid Korea branch, the Bureau of Culture and Education, the Young Pioneers headquarters, or the radio station to help you. After you have done it well, report it to the local radio station orally or in writing. The central and local People's Radio Stations will also broadcast the work of the best among you, so that the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary military personnel, the People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers abroad can all know about your activities.
    We wish you success in your work!

    快乐的春节就要到了。我们希望你们在春节期间，努力做好一件事，就是慰劳我们的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属。
    小朋友们：你们都知道，在毛主席领导下面，我们的祖国一天比一天强盛，我们的生活一天比一天快乐。快要到来的春节，一定比往年更加快乐。在这个时候，我们自然而然地会想起谁给我们创造了这么幸福的生活，谁保卫着我们这幸福的生活。我们自然而然地会想到革命烈士们，想到人民解放军，想到人民志愿军。小朋友们，我们应该怎样感谢他们呢？应该怎样慰劳他们，支援他们呢？
    小朋友们：你们能够做的事情是很多的。现在我们只要求你们在春节中努力做好这样一件事，就是慰劳我们的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属。你们最好组织起来，或者是一个小组、或者是一个小队，除开给烈属、军属拜年以外，还应该一块儿想办法，调查他们有什么困难，有什么需要帮助的地方，然后拣你们能够做的，给他们做好。你们至少要给他们做好一件事情。这样，你们就不但慰劳了烈士的家属和军人的家属，而且鼓励了我们的人民解放军和人民志愿军的战士。
    小朋友们：你们都是爱国的少年儿童，我们相信你们会把这件事办好的。如果你们有什么困难，你们可以请当地的抗美援朝分会、文教局、少年儿童队队部或是广播电台帮助你们。你们做好之后，就向当地的广播电台作口头的或书面的报告。中央的和各地的人民广播电台，还要把你们中间工作得特别好的，广播出去，使全国的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，人民解放军和国外的人民志愿军，都能知道你们的活动。
    祝你们工作顺利！
