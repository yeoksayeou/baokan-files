Following the unfolding of the rectification and study movement in Beijing's literary and art circles, it has been met with a response from literary and art workers in Tianjin.

The Communist Party member cadres of Tianjin's various cultural and art troupes held a mobilization meeting for study on December 7th. Huang Songling, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report. He pointed out that since Tianjin's liberation, literary and art work has failed to keep up with objective needs, mainly because after entering the city, in the new working environment, the petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness of literary and art workers began to revive and develop, leading to ambiguity and wavering regarding Chairman Mao's literary and art policies. Tianjin's literary and art cadres have a serious tendency to become divorced from reality and politics. Some comrades are peddling petty-bourgeois goods under the banner of working-class literature and art; under the slogan of "bringing forth the new from the old," they are uniting with, making concessions to, or accommodating old literature and art without principle. Some literary and art cadres have serious liberalism, lack organization and discipline, and even have shameful degenerate behavior of literati without morals. Literary and art troupes are like empty shells, and literary and art organizations are busy with administrative matters. Some comrades are idle and do no work year-round, and are not ashamed of it; a few have completely lost the temperament of Communist Party members. Finally, he called on all Party member cadres engaged in literary and art work to strictly examine themselves from the Party's standpoint, eliminate all petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies and bourgeois ideological influences, first rectify the Party's literary and art ranks, establish proletarian leadership thinking, and lead the city's literary and art workers to improve Tianjin's literary and art work a step further. Then, Meng Bo conveyed the various reports and situations of the Beijing literary and art circles' rectification mobilization meeting. Fang Ji and Lu Li made criticisms and self-criticisms. Fang Ji first made a further review of his novel "Let Life Become Better," believing that it glorified unrestrained and frivolous love-supremacism from a petty-bourgeois perspective. Secondly, he criticized several poems by Lu Dian and Lu Li, and criticized many literary and art workers in Tianjin for coexisting peacefully with some erroneous ideas, such as openly defending A Long's erroneous literary and art ideas; taking an unserious attitude towards the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun"; and the editorial staff of "Tianjin Literature and Art" taking a dismissive attitude after being criticized by the "People's Daily." Finally, Li Huasheng, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, concluded that the thinking of Tianjin's literary and art cadres has developed to the serious point of almost forgetting who they serve. All Party's literary and art cadres must seriously treat this rectification movement. More than forty Party member literary and art cadres participated in this rectification movement and are now organized into groups under the leadership of the Culture and Education Committee for study. In the future, various literary and art departments will submit summary reports, which will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion and approval, and then appropriate conclusions will be drawn on the relevant guidelines and ideological issues in Tianjin's literary and art work.

Cao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Literary and Art Writers Association, Kong Fang, Head of the Shenyang Municipal Cultural Troupe, and other literary and art workers also expressed their views in the "Northeast Daily," believing that a rectification and study movement in literary and art circles should also be launched in the Northeast. In late November, the Northeast had just held a music work conference, which criticized the petty-bourgeois tendencies in music work, the failure of many works to truly express the thoughts and feelings of the working people, or the unsuitability of the melodies to the masses' appreciation habits; music workers' preference for grand styles and Western musical instruments; and some people going to factories and slacking off because there was no piano. This conference specifically pointed out that in order to overcome the current shortcomings in music work in the Northeast, music workers should first criticize purely technical viewpoints and individualism, strengthen political study, go deep into life, and learn from Chinese national and folk music; everything should proceed from the needs of the masses, and the creation of mass songs should be placed first, and the creation of large-scale works should be placed second.

    文艺界的整风运动在天津和东北的反应
    北京市文艺界整风学习展开后，已得到天津的文艺工作者的响应。
    天津各文化艺术团体的共产党员干部在十二月七日举行学习动员大会，由中共天津市委宣传部部长黄松龄作报告。他指出：天津解放以后的文艺工作跟不上客观需要，主要是因为进城以后，在新的工作环境下，文艺工作者当中的小资产阶级的思想意识开始复活和发展，对毛主席的文艺方针发生了模糊动摇。天津文艺干部中有严重脱离实际、脱离政治的倾向。有些同志在工人阶级文艺的招牌下贩卖小资产阶级的货色；在“推陈出新”的口号下，对旧文艺无原则地团结、让步或迁就。有些文艺干部中有严重的自由主义，无组织无纪律，以至文人无行的可耻的堕落行为。文艺团体如同虚设，文艺机关忙于事务。有些同志游手好闲，常年不做工作，不以为耻，个别的人已完全失掉共产党员的气质。最后他号召全体作文艺工作的党员干部，必须站在党的立场严格检查自己，肃清一切小资产阶级的思想倾向和资产阶级的思想影响，首先整顿党的文艺队伍，树立无产阶级的领导思想，好带领全市文艺工作者把天津的文艺工作提高一步。接着由孟波传达了北京文艺界整风动员大会的各项报告和情况。方纪、鲁藜等作了批评和自我批评。方纪首先对自己的小说“让生活变得更美好罢”作了进一步的检讨，认为这是用小资产阶级观点歌颂了放任轻浮的恋爱至上主义。其次，他批评了芦甸和鲁藜的几首诗歌，批评了天津不少文艺工作者竟与一些错误思想和平共居，如公开为阿垅的错误的文艺思想辩护；对电影“武训传”的讨论采取不严肃的态度；“天津文艺”受“人民日报”批评后，编辑人员竟采取了置之不理的态度。最后由中共市委宣传部李华生副部长作结论，他说，天津文艺干部的思想已经发展到几乎忘记了为谁服务的严重地步，全体党的文艺干部必须严肃地对待这一整风运动。参加此次整风运动的党员文艺干部一共四十多人，现已在文教委员会领导下分别编组，进行学习，将来由各文艺部门提出总结报告，交由大会讨论批准，然后对天津文艺工作中有关方针和思想性的问题，作出适当的结论。
    东北文艺作家协会副主席草明、沈阳市文工团团长孔方以及其他文艺工作者也在“东北日报”上发表意见，认为东北也应该开展一个文艺界整风学习运动。十一月下旬东北刚举行过一次音乐工作会议，批判了音乐工作中的小资产阶级倾向，许多作品不能真正表现劳动人民的思想感情；或曲调不适合群众的欣赏习惯；音乐工作者喜欢大气派和西洋乐器；有人下工厂去，因为没有钢琴就开小差。此次会议特别指出：为克服目前东北音乐工作中的缺点，音乐工作者首先应该批判单纯技术观点和个人主义思想，加强政治学习，深入生活，并向中国民族的、民间的音乐学习；一切从群众需要出发，把创作群众歌曲放在第一位，大型作品的创作放在第二位。
