[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 24th] At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 24th, in order to eliminate all concerns and excuses of the other party regarding rear area inspections, and taking into account the other party's proposal of December 23rd, our side again proposed amendments to the fourth, fifth, and sixth articles of our six-principle proposal of December 14th, which had not yet been agreed upon. Our representative reiterated our side's unwavering position of not allowing interference in internal affairs, and requested the other party to seriously consider and accept our proposal. The full text of our amended proposal is attached.

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative continued to demand that the other party explain the whereabouts of 44,259 of our personnel on the list of prisoners of war submitted by the other party through the International Committee of the Red Cross, and thoroughly refuted the other party's argument of demanding prisoners of war from our side based on the prisoner numbers we had previously announced. Our representative pointed out that, according to our side's consistent policy of leniency towards prisoners of war, our side released a large number of prisoners of war during the war, which is a universally known fact, and our side is now prepared to quickly release all prisoners of war still in custody. However, the other party not only detained 44,259 people after formally notifying our side that they had captured a total of 176,733 prisoners of war from our side, but also openly stated that they would further detain 16,243 prisoners of war. The fact and attempt of the other party to detain prisoners of war is disgraceful. Our policy on prisoners of war truly conforms to humanitarianism. At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item on the 24th, our representative handed over to the other party the letter from home of Dean, the commander of the U.S. 24th Division, who was a prisoner of war held by our side, and declared that our side would continue to forward letters from home to the other party's prisoners of war, and requested the other party to also forward letters from home to our prisoners of war.

	Attachment: The full text of our amended proposal is as follows:

	(IV) In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice and facilitate the holding of a higher-level political conference between the two sides, both sides guarantee that no military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, or ammunition will enter Korea from outside Korea after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement. The rotation of military personnel within the limits agreed upon by both sides shall be reported to the Military Armistice Commission for on-site supervision by a neutral nations supervisory body, and shall be conducted at rear ports agreed upon by both sides.

	(V) Each side shall appoint an equal number of commissioners to form a Military Armistice Commission, which shall be responsible for supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement and negotiating the handling of any violations of the armistice agreement. The execution of the supervisory and inspection tasks stipulated in the armistice agreement shall be handled in accordance with the following two provisions:

	(A) Within the demilitarized zone, the Military Armistice Commission shall be responsible through its directly dispatched joint teams.

	(B) At rear ports agreed upon by both sides outside the demilitarized zone, and at locations reported to have violated the armistice agreement, a supervisory body composed of representatives of neutral nations shall be entrusted with the responsibility. When either side or one side of the Military Armistice Commission requests the neutral nations supervisory body to investigate incidents violating the armistice agreement, the supervisory body must be responsible for conducting inspections.

	(VI) Both sides agree to invite neutral countries that have not participated in the Korean War, with their consent, to send an equal number of representatives to form a supervisory body, which shall be entrusted by the Military Armistice Commission to be responsible for the supervision and inspection tasks stipulated in Article IV and Article V (B) of this agreement. When either side or any party of the Military Armistice Commission requests the execution of this task, the neutral nations supervisory body shall dispatch inspection teams to rear ports agreed upon by both sides, or to locations outside the demilitarized zone where violations of the armistice agreement have been reported, to conduct the supervision and inspection tasks stipulated in the armistice agreement, and report the results of the supervision and inspection to the Military Armistice Commission. The two sides shall provide full convenience on the main traffic and transportation lines agreed upon by both sides when the neutral nations inspection teams are carrying out the above tasks.

    我方对第三项议程再次提出修正案
    重申我方不容许干涉内政的立场
    我在第四项议程小组委员会上彻底驳斥美方论点
    【新华社开城二十四日电】二十四日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方为解除对方对于后方视察问题的一切顾虑与藉口，照顾了对方十二月二十三日的方案，再次提出我方十二月十四日的六项原则建议中尚未达成协议的第四、第五、第六条的修正案。我方代表重申我方不容许干涉内政的不可动摇的立场，要求对方郑重考虑并接受我方这一方案。我方修正方案全文见附件。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续要求对方解释对方经由红十字国际委员会交来战俘名单中我方人员四万四千二百五十九名的下落，并彻底驳斥对方根据我方曾经宣布过的俘虏数字向我方索取战俘的论点。我方代表指出，根据我方一贯的对于俘虏的宽大政策，我方在战时释放了大批俘虏是举世皆知的事实，而我方现又准备迅速全部释放尚在收容的全部战俘。但对方不仅于正式通知我方一共俘虏我方十七万六千七百三十三名战俘后，扣留了四万四千二百五十九名，而且还公开声称，将再扣留一万六千二百四十三名战俘。对方这种扣留俘虏的事实与企图是见不得人的。我方的俘虏政策是真正符合于人道主义的。我方代表在二十四日第四项议程的小组委员会上，将我方收容的战俘美军二十四师师长迪安的家书转交对方，并声明我方将继续收转对方战俘家信，要求对方亦转交我方战俘的家书。
        附件：我方修正方案全文如下：
    （四）为保证军事停战的稳定，以利双方高一级的政治会议的进行，双方保证于停战协议签字并生效后，不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。双方协议限度内的军事人员的轮换，应报告军事停战委员会，以便委托中立国监察机构进行实地督察，并应在双方同意的后方口岸进行。
    （五）双方各指定同等数目的委员，组成军事停战委员会，负责监督停战协议的实施，及协商处理任何违反停战协议的事件。停战协议中所规定的监督与视察任务的执行，应按照下列两项规定办理：
    （甲）在非军事区以内由军事停战委员会利用其直接派遣的联合小组负责。
    （乙）在非军事区以外的双方同意的后方口岸，及报告发生违反停战协议事件的地点，则委托中立国代表组成的监察机构负责，军事停战委员会中双方或一方向中立国监察机构提出调查违反停战协议事件的请求时，监察机构即须负责进行视察。
    （六）双方同意邀请未曾参加朝鲜战争的中立国家，在得其同意后，派出同等数目的代表组成监察机构，接受军事停战委员会的委托，负责执行本协议第四条及第五条（乙）项所规定的监督与视察的任务，军事停战委员会中双方或任何一方提出关于执行此项任务的请求时，中立国监察机构即应派遣视察小组至双方同意的后方口岸，或非军事区外报告发生违反停战协议事件的地点，进行停战协议中所规定的监督与视察任务，并将监督与视察的结果，报告军事停战委员会。中立国视察小组在进行上述任务时，双方应给以双方协议的主要交通线与运输线上的充分便利。
