    "Year-end" Should Be Renamed "New Year Holiday"
    Comrade Editor: Earlier this month, newspapers across the country successively published a Xinhua News Agency dispatch entitled "The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government Issues Instructions on Stabilizing Prices at the New and Old Year-End." We feel that the term "Year-end" used in it is very inappropriate.
    The reason why the New Year holiday was called "Year-end" in the past was because in the old society, the broad masses of working people suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the ruling class, and their lives were extremely poor. Whenever the New Year approached, landlords and usurers would press for debts. Therefore, the working people regarded the New Year as passing a "barrier." For example, in the movie "The White Haired Girl," the farmer Yang Bailao was so frightened that he dared not spend the New Year at home because the landlord Huang Shiren fiercely pressed him for debts. This shows that the New Year holiday in the old society was not a joyous festival for the working people, but a life-or-death "barrier." Now, the rule of landlords and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie in our country has been overthrown, and the working people have become the masters of the country. They will never again regard the New Year as passing a "barrier," but as a happy festival. We suggest that propaganda organs in various regions should best use New Year propaganda to explain to the masses that "Year-end" should be renamed "New Year Holiday," and they should explain why this is done to improve the people's level of awareness.

### “年关”应该改称“年节”

    “年关”应该改称“年节”
    编辑同志：本月上旬，各地报纸先后刊载了新华社播发的“中央人民政府贸易部发出稳定新旧年关物价的指示”。我们觉得其中“年关”二字，用得很不妥当。
    过去所以把年节称作“年关”，是因为在旧社会里，广大劳动人民受着统治阶级的剥削压榨，生活极端贫困，每逢过年，地主、高利贷者就要逼债讨债，因此，劳动人民视过年如过“关”。例如电影
    “白毛女”中的农民杨白劳，因为地主黄世仁凶恶地向他逼债，他吓得不敢在家里过年。这就说明，年节在旧社会对于劳动人民并不是什么可欢庆的节日，而是一个生死“关”。现在，我国的地主、官僚资产阶级的统治已被打倒，劳动人民成为国家的主人，他们永远再不会把过年当作过“关”了，而是把它当作快乐的节日了。我们建议各地宣传机关，最好通过新年宣传，向群众说明，应该把“年关”改称“年节”，并且应该说明为什么这样作，以提高人民群众的觉悟水平。
