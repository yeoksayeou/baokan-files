Shanxi Province's state-run farms have largely achieved bumper harvests this year, with many farms setting record high per-unit area yields for crops such as cotton and corn. These farms have demonstrated a model role for state-run farms in the movement to increase per-unit area yields. The more than 830 mu of cotton fields in the Yuncheng Special District farm this year, even the lowest-yielding dry land, yielded twice as much as local farmers. One 1.8 mu high-yield plot averaged 928 jin of seed cotton per mu. The 14 mu of Golden Queen corn at the Yangqu County farm averaged 1,073 jin per mu, exceeding the highest local corn yield by 2.6 times. Among them, three mu of high-yield land averaged 1,353 jin of corn per mu. The yields of sorghum, millet, kenaf and other crops planted by the Yangqu County Farm also greatly exceeded the yields of local farmers. In addition, the provincial farm harvested 960 jin of rice per mu from rice planted on a saline-alkali land this year.

The bumper harvest of state-run farms has had a huge impact on local farmers. Seeing that the farms use new-style agricultural tools and scientific farming methods to grow crops with yields several times higher, farmers have gradually changed their conservative thinking and become very interested in new-style agricultural tools and scientific farming techniques, and have asked the farms for guidance. There are nearly one hundred state-run farms in Shanxi, spread throughout the province. These farms have established technical guidance relationships with local model laborers, technical experts, village technical committees and technical research groups, and specially invited farmers. In this way, Shanxi Province has formed a vast agricultural technology extension network centered on these farms. This year, there are 731 specially invited improved seed extension farmers in Shanxi Province who are carrying out demonstration work in planting improved seeds under the guidance of the farms. There are 1,729 village technical committees and technical research groups, and more than 350 mutual aid teams' small farms, all of which have planted improved crop varieties promoted by the farms.

    山西国营农场创造棉花等作物丰产纪录
    在提高单位面积产量运动中发挥了示范作用
    山西省各地的国营农场今年大部丰收，有许多农场创造了棉花、玉蜀黍等作物的单位面积产量的最高纪录，发挥了国营农场在提高单位面积产量运动中的示范作用。运城专区农场今年的八百三十多亩棉田，其中产量最低的旱地，收获也比当地农民多一倍。有一亩八分丰产地，每亩平均产量是籽棉九百二十八斤。阳曲县县农场今年的十四亩金皇后玉蜀黍，每亩平均产一千零七十三斤，超过当地玉蜀黍最高产量二点六倍。其中有三亩丰产地，每亩平均产玉米一千三百五十三斤。阳曲县县农场所种的高粱、谷子、洋麻等作物的产量，也都大大超过了当地农民的产量。另外，省农场今年在一块碱地上所种的水稻，一亩地收了九百六十斤稻子。
    国营农场丰收在当地农民中所起的影响极大。农民看见农场用新式农具，和科学的耕作方法种庄稼，收成高几倍，他们便逐渐改变了自己的保守思想，对新式农具和科学的耕作技术大感兴趣，纷纷要求农场指导。山西的国营农场近一百个，遍布全省各地。这些农场，都和当地农民中的劳动模范、技术能手、村技术委员会和技术研究小组、特约农户等，建立有技术指导的关系。这样，山西省便形成了一个以这些农场为中心的庞大的农业技术推广网。今年，山西全省有七百三十一个特约的良种推广农户，在农场的指导下进行种植良种的示范工作，有一千七百二十九个村技术委员会和技术研究小组、三百五十多个互助组的小农场，都种了农场推广的优良作物品种。    （新华社）
