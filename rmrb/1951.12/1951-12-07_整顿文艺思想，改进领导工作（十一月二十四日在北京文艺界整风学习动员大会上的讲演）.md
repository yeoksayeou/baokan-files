Comrades! Qiao Mu has just made profound and pertinent criticisms of the serious phenomena existing in literary and art circles.

The state of ideological confusion in literary and art work has reached a point where it can no longer be tolerated and must be clarified. In literary and art work, and even in some parts of the leadership of literary and art work, a rather strong petty-bourgeois ideological tendency is manifested; if this tendency is not corrected, Mao Zedong's line on literature and art cannot be implemented, and the cause of people's literature and art cannot advance. Because the leadership of literary and art work has relaxed or abandoned the leadership of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, and abandoned the work of criticizing, struggling against, and transforming all non-working-class ideologies, it has given bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies a large gap to occupy the leading position in literary and art work. The seriousness of the problem lies here. This is also the root cause of why the film "The Life of Wu Xun" was able to be filmed, screened, and once blindly praised.

Our literature and art are an important part of the people's cause led by the working class. Our country is led by the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, has become the leading ideology of our country. Our writers, artists, and literary and art leading personnel bear the important responsibility of educating all the people with the advanced working-class ideology, Mao Zedong Thought. We should strive to become, as Gorky said, "the eyes, ears, and voice of the class," "the sensory organs of the class." If we do not arm ourselves with the working-class ideology to educate the people, but allow non-working-class ideologies, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, to educate the people; if we do not make every effort to combine literature and art with the politics of our class and the broad masses of the people, but allow literature and art to be divorced from politics and the people; if we do not develop criticism and self-criticism in literary and art work, but allow liberalism to develop; then it cannot be said that the leadership aspect of literary and art work has committed serious errors. Even if this error is committed not on all issues, but on some issues, it is serious. As one of the main leaders of literary and art work, I should bear a great responsibility.

Rectifying literary and art thought and improving leadership work is an urgent task on the current agenda of literary and art work. We must complete this task in this rectification study.

We often talk about the ideological nature of literature and art. What is ideological nature? That is, literature and art should be combined with the ideology of the most progressive class, the working class, their worldview, and their outlook on life. Without this combination, such literature and art are not needed by the people and cannot guide the people forward; such literature and art cannot play an active role in social life. In class society, literature and art always express the consciousness of a certain class, either the consciousness of this class or the consciousness of that class. Therefore, we have a task before us to conduct a class analysis of the various thoughts and emotions expressed in literary and artistic works, as well as the various literary and artistic viewpoints that appear in society, and distinguish which are the thoughts of the working class and which are the thoughts of the petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie, or even the feudal class.

Revolutionary writers, critics, and especially literary and art leading personnel, must possess this ability to distinguish ideas, otherwise ideological confusion will inevitably be caused in the field of literature and art. The working class must not only draw a clear ideological line with imperialism and feudalism, and eliminate all ideological remnants of imperialism and feudalism, but also draw a clear ideological line with the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie within the people. As early as in "On New Democracy," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the culture of new democracy can only be led by the proletariat and only by communist ideology, and cannot be led by any other class or ideology. In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," he clearly pointed out: "The things that truly belong to the masses of the people must now be led by the proletariat; things led by the bourgeoisie cannot belong to the masses of the people." If the leadership of working-class ideology is abandoned in literary and art work, then bourgeois ideology is allowed to lead; then literature and art are not the people's. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out in "On New Democracy" that the cultural thought of the Chinese bourgeoisie is more backward than its political things. The bourgeoisie has long been unable to play a leading role on the cultural front. The literary and art workers of the petty bourgeoisie have the greatest influence in literary and art circles. They are inclined to revolution in politics, but before they have undergone ideological transformation, their thoughts and artistic styles are basically bourgeois. Of course, they cannot become the leading force on the cultural front. However, due to the position of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie in the state power, and due to the existence of private capitalist elements and small producer individual economic elements in the economy, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology still has a considerable social foundation. These ideas cannot but tenaciously manifest themselves in all aspects of the people's cause (including the literary and art aspect), and take various "revolutionary" forms. Therefore, it is a long-term task on the ideological front for the working class to draw a clear ideological line with the bourgeoisie, especially the petty bourgeoisie, and to criticize and overcome the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology with its own advanced ideology.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship":

"The people's state protects the people. With the people's state, the people have the possibility, on a national scale and on a total scale, to educate themselves and transform themselves by democratic methods, so that they can get rid of the influence of internal and external reactionaries (this influence is still very great now, and will exist for a long time, and cannot be quickly eliminated), transform the bad habits and bad ideas they got from the old society, not let themselves go into the wrong path guided by the reactionaries, and continue to move forward, towards socialist society and communist society development."

This passage is extremely important. It points out the most central and fundamental task of literary and art work and the entire ideological work. Literature and art must use the ideas of the working class to help the country educate the people, help the people grow up, and lead the people towards socialism and communism. Can the bourgeois, urban petty-bourgeois ideology, or the peasant class ideology accomplish this great historical task? That is absolutely impossible.

We have learned about bourgeois ideology in the film "The Life of Wu Xun." It promotes reactionary reformism and the route of individual struggle in politics. Is this compatible with the people's democratic revolutionary thought and the collectivist heroism that we want to promote?

We have also learned about urban petty-bourgeois ideology in the novel and film "Between Husband and Wife." It distorts the image of working people with the eyes and tastes of intellectuals, indulging in the bad ideas and habits brought from the old society, and vulgarizing politics. Is this compatible with what we advocate in creation, to correctly express new people and new ideas in the people, and to seriously express the requirements of political themes?

Is the peasant class ideology okay? It is true that many literary and art works in the Liberated Areas were about peasants, about their production and struggle, but that was not peasant literature and art. Some professors regard the literature and art in the Liberated Areas as peasant literature and art, which is wrong. They wrote about peasants, but they did not write about peasants from the standpoint of ordinary peasants, but from the standpoint of the working class. They used the eyes of the working class to observe the fate of peasants and expressed the process of peasants' awakening under the leadership of the working class. So these works are the literature and art of the working class. If it were not such literature and art, it would not have had such a huge effect in the people's movement as the scripts of "The White-Haired Girl" and "Liu Hulan" have had. There are also works that express peasant ideas, such as some works that simply promote "getting rich," which is expressing peasant ideas, and in fact, is promoting capitalist ideas. Therefore, it is very clear that we cannot use bourgeois or petty-bourgeois ideology, nor can we use peasant ideology, to educate the people, but only the advanced working-class ideology.

Shortly after the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the literary and art circles in Shanghai raised the question of whether it is possible to write about the petty bourgeoisie. Comrade Mao Zedong had already said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that the first is for workers, the second for peasants, the third for soldiers, and the fourth for urban petty bourgeoisie, and this position has been determined. The question is: how to do it? Is it to teach them to move forward, that is, to raise the petty bourgeoisie to the level of the working class, or to teach them to fall behind, that is, to lower the level of the working class to cater to the petty bourgeoisie? Some people say that the audience of movies is mainly petty citizens, so more attention should be paid to petty citizens. Should we pay attention to petty citizens? Of course, we should. The question still remains: is it to lower the level of the working class to cater to the tastes, thoughts, and hobbies of the petty citizens, or to raise the tastes, thoughts, and hobbies of the petty citizens to the level of the working class? Our state-owned film industry has implemented the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and has not adopted the practice of catering to and pandering to petty citizens, which is correct.

For a considerable period of time after the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, literary and art circles were "calm," with no ideological struggle or ideological criticism. It was not until the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" that the atmosphere of ideological struggle in cultural and art circles was opened up. During this period, "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) did some useful criticism work. The struggle on the literary and art front is mainly to adopt the methods of ideological criticism and literary and art criticism, and use Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and its theory on literature and art to criticize all erroneous literary and art thoughts and works, so as to consolidate and expand the leading position of Marxist-Leninist literary and art thought. Naturally, there is another equally important or even more important method, which is the competition of works, using works that combine advanced thinking and high technology to exclude and replace all works with erroneous thinking and poor technology. The advanced literature and art of the working class can only truly grow up in free competition and in the strict identification and test of the broad masses. Therefore, we must oppose the phenomena of shoddy work and slowdown in literary and artistic creation, because that is to weaken and reduce the position of working-class literature and art and damage the cause of people's literature and art.

We emphasize ideological struggle and ideological criticism, not to weaken the people's democratic united front in literature and art, but to make this united front more consolidated. Since the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, the relationship between literary and art workers in all aspects, and between party and non-party literary and art workers, has generally been cooperative. A fundamental shortcoming is the lack of mutual criticism, the lack of truly sincere, frank, and heart-to-heart criticism, and the lack of mutual supervision and encouragement in the cause. We have more contact with non-party comrades in daily work, but less contact in ideology. Non-party comrades feel that party comrades do not help them enough. Where is it not enough? I think the main thing is that there is too little help in politics. Non-party comrades can also help us, and we also need their help, and we need to learn from them. They have much richer social experience and artistic experience than many of our party members, and there are many places where they can help the people and young people. If we do a good job in helping them politically, they will also better help us. Only through this mutual help, mutual criticism, and mutual supervision can our relationship be closer and better; it is truly good, not superficially good.

To achieve true and better unity, ideological transformation is necessary. Comrade Mao Zedong especially emphasized the great significance of launching a movement of self-education and self-transformation on the cultural and educational front and among various intellectuals at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction, this meeting put forward the task of widely launching ideological transformation movement and systematically organizing the study of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, as one of the central tasks of the people of the whole country at present. This task is especially important for literary and art workers. Because the duty of literary and art workers is to educate the people and transform the people's thoughts through their works. To educate and transform others, one must first educate and transform oneself. Comrade Mao Zedong solved many basic problems in literature and art in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." For example, the relationship between literature and art and politics, the relationship between popularization and improvement, etc., but one of the most fundamental problems is ideological transformation. In that speech, Comrade Mao Zedong used very vivid and popular language to sharply ask all literary and art workers a question: on which side is your "butt" sitting? If it is sitting on the side of the petty bourgeoisie, then "you must move your butt over" to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the key to the problem. If this key problem is not solved, the relationship between art and politics, the relationship between popularization and improvement, etc., cannot be solved. If they are "solved," they are all fake. The question of which side the "butt" is sitting on is also the question of standpoint. Once this question is solved, other questions can be easily solved. Many literary and art workers do not recognize the importance and necessity of ideological transformation. If we abandon the work of ideological transformation of literary and art workers, that is to remove the revolutionary content of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and reduce this speech to the extent that all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois liberals can accept it; abandoning ideological transformation is abandoning the communist principle standpoint. Therefore, every comrade should adopt a conscious attitude towards ideological transformation. Without consciousness, it cannot be transformed. Comrades who have undergone transformation in the old liberated areas should not think that they have undergone rectification and study in Yan'an, so there is no problem. Aren't there also comrades in the old liberated areas who have undergone rectification, who, when they arrived in a new environment, surrounded by the influence of various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, revealed their petty-bourgeois tails again? There are always thousands of threads between intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins and the petty bourgeoisie, which are not easy to break, while their connection with the workers and peasants is often loose and easy to break. As for comrades in the newly liberated areas who have not undergone transformation, their thoughts and feelings have not changed at all in reality. Although they also talk about workers, peasants, and soldiers, what they like in their hearts is still the petty bourgeoisie. Some old left-wing literary and art workers also have
    a self-proclaimed very "revolutionary" burden (I also had this burden), which greatly hinders their progress; this burden must be dropped. Today, the vast majority of literary and art workers in the country need to be transformed. Without this transformation, asking them to improve the ideological nature of literature and art, if not empty talk, can only improve their petty-bourgeois ideological nature. Only through rectification study and ideological transformation will a new atmosphere emerge among the vast number of literary and art workers and the literature and art they create.

At present, there is a serious tendency in literary and art work to be divorced from politics and the masses of the people. This tendency makes literary and art work lack vigorous vitality, and creation is not vigorous enough. Quite a few literary and artistic works lack full emotion.

In the past two years, our country has experienced tremendous changes and progress - resisting the United States and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and the patriotic production increase movement of workers and peasants. Among literary and art workers, many have participated in these great people's movements; but there are still many who have not participated, and they are far away from these great storms of people's struggle. Even those who have participated in these movements are not in-depth, and some simply hold a simple attitude of "visiting," "interviewing," or "collecting materials." Many literary and art workers lack a constant exploration and pursuit of new things; they lack a high degree of enthusiasm for expressing new life and new people. Why are the several short Korean communications written by Comrade Wei Wei, such as "Who are the Most Beloved People?" "Young People, Let Your Youth Be More Beautiful!" "Soldiers and the Motherland," so warmly welcomed by the vast readers, and aroused such a strong emotion in them? This is because the author conveyed in his works a kind of inspiring class enthusiasm and mass enthusiasm that is lacking in the works of many other authors. He truly explored the depths of the hearts of the heroes, and he gained inspiration and strength from there, so he used all his life's strength and enthusiasm to sing the praises of those heroes. Comrade Wei Wei is familiar with the soldiers, those "most beloved people," and he truly loves them. This is the secret of why his works can be so touching.

We often emphasize that literature and art should express new life and new people, and express revolutionary optimism and heroism, which is very necessary. But if we do not wage a resolute struggle against the tendency of literary and art workers to be divorced from the people, then they cannot create heroic images of new people. There have been various erroneous arguments advocating the tendency to be divorced from the people, for example, life is everywhere, and the important thing is personal experience, thus shutting themselves in the narrow little world of personal experience and being self-satisfied, living what they call the life of a "true artist." Some authors became muddled in their minds in this comfortable living environment. In their midst, the political atmosphere gradually became thin. Political enthusiasm began to decline. They also go to the lives of the masses, but they do not actively participate in the activities and struggles of the masses, and they do not care about the fate of the people with full enthusiasm. What they care about is only their own creation. They do not express life according to the laws of life itself, but according to the laws of books, such as "dramaturgy." They are meticulous in finding "dramatic" materials in life. In this way, how can they discover and express new people and new heroes in the lives of the people? Therefore, when they deal with political themes in their works, they vulgarize politics, and when they describe workers, peasants, and soldiers, they distort the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They lost the source of life for their creation. The failure of the creation room of the Central Academy of Drama came about in this way, which is the inevitable result of being divorced from politics and the people in literary and art work.

Another most serious phenomenon of the separation of literature and art from the people is that some high-level literary and art institutions and literary and art specialists have not paid enough attention to and given enough guidance to the vigorous and vibrant literary and art activities that are developing among the broad masses of workers and peasants. The tendency to despise popularization work still exists and has not been effectively corrected.

The tendency to be divorced from politics is also manifested in the relationship between political and technical learning. In our art schools, there is a bias of neglecting political learning and unilaterally emphasizing technical learning. They mistakenly understand improving artistry as simply improving technology, without understanding that improving the artistry of works cannot be separated from improving the ideological and mass nature of works. At the same time, they mistakenly believe that learning technology is simply learning some technical methods. Technical methods should be learned. But learning these methods does not mean solving all or even the main problems in technical learning. The main problem is still to cultivate the ability of literary and art apprentices to observe and express life, especially the ability to observe life politically. Thinking that technology plus politics is a good work is completely the view of a simple craftsman who does not understand politics and does not understand art. Everyone knows that to create truly living artistic works, the author must observe life widely and deeply, and only the life of the people is the real basis of artistic works. This is the fundamental principle of the realistic creation method. Unilaterally emphasizing technical learning is also combined with the erroneous tendency of blindly worshiping the West. This tendency occupies a considerable position in our art schools. Some experts believe that learning technology is learning the West, and there is no technology to learn in China. They despise the Chinese national art heritage and do not place the organization and research of their own national heritage in an important position in teaching and research work. All these manifestations are anti-people and anti-patriotism.

As a result of relaxing or abandoning the leadership of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, and because of the tendency to be divorced from politics and the people in literary and art work, a serious liberal style is bound to arise in literary and art work. There is almost no criticism and self-criticism among literary and art workers. Some comrades have begun to openly express their aversion to criticism. Where there is no criticism, the literary and art work there is actually in a state of stagnation and inevitably suffers serious failures. Learning among literary and art workers is very poor; there is little study of Marxist-Leninist theory and little study of their professions. Literary and art workers are mental laborers whose task is to produce literary and artistic works, a kind of spiritual food that is closely related to the broad masses of the people. They should have labor discipline. If a literary and artistic creation organization or a literary and artistic author does not produce works for one or two years, or the works produced are unusable, then he has not completed the production task, which is not allowed according to labor discipline. Now, the concept of labor and the concept of discipline among our literary and art workers are very poor, or it can simply be said that they have not been established yet. Since the literary and artistic ranks have no concept of combat, no concept of labor, and no concept of discipline, they will naturally be scattered, lose their combat goals and combat effectiveness, and lose a strong leading core and backbone, and literature and art will not become a front.

I have said above many serious shortcomings and errors in literary and art work, especially in literary and art leadership thinking. Comrades should not think that the leadership of the entire literature and art is a mess. Whether in the leadership of literary and art work or among the vast number of literary and art workers, correct and healthy factors exist and play a role, otherwise it cannot explain the achievements we have made in the past two years. The problem is that the leadership has not well mobilized and organized this correct force to fight against those erroneous tendencies, and to overcome the erroneous things with the correct things, so that the direction of the leadership has become unclear and unstable, and the advancement of the literary and artistic cause has been hindered.

If we want to rectify literary and art leadership thinking, we must improve the specific work of literary and art leadership. The literary and artistic cause is not an individual cause, but a collective cause. The literary and artistic cause, as I said earlier, is an important part of the people's cause of the country. The literary and artistic cause cannot have any other interests except the interests of the country and the people. Therefore, our party and our country attach great importance to this cause. The literary and art workers' own organizations should do well to promote this cause.

To improve leadership work methods, we must establish ideological leadership and oppose bureaucratic leadership; we must establish collective and scientific leadership methods and oppose personal inspiration and handicraft-style leadership.

The so-called thoughtless leadership does not mean that the mind is truly in a state of vacuum, but only lacks the leadership thinking of the working class and lacks Mao Zedong Thought that combines Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Since there is a lack of thinking in this area, petty-bourgeois thinking and all other non-working-class thinking can conveniently sneak into the leading position. Any leadership work should be ideological, not to mention that literary and art work itself is an ideological work related to the education of hundreds of millions of people, which requires a highly ideological leadership even more. Now, our literary and artistic cause has become a cause with a broad mass nature. The number of movie viewers will be close to the number of the national population. In the past, literary and art publications sold only a few thousand copies, but now they sell hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of copies. Our literature and art have become an important part of the world's progressive literature and art. The people of the East and the world are paying attention to all aspects of our country's cause, and they are also paying attention to our literary and artistic cause. Our country, thanks to Chairman Mao's correct leadership and the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country under his leadership, has already won such a lofty and glorious position in the world. Our country has achieved so many new and great achievements and victories in military, political, and economic terms. The achievements in our literature and art seem too disproportionate compared with these. We must make every effort to make it more proportionate. We must treat such an important ideological work as literature and art with a high degree of seriousness and political responsibility. We cannot allow the phenomenon of shoddy work in literature and art, and we cannot reduce our ideological requirements for literary and artistic works in the slightest. Because the masses have grown up politically, ideologically, and culturally, they often put forward critical opinions on literature and art. Mass criticism is a new phenomenon in the field of literature and art, a phenomenon that deserves great attention and is applauded. This indicates that the relationship between the people and literature and art is completely different from that of the past. They regard literature and art as their own cause and often put forward criticisms and demands. If we lower the requirements for literature and art ourselves and allow shoddy work, we will make our literary and artistic cause divorced from the needs of the people and the country. We cannot do that. The leading personnel in all aspects of literature and art must regard reviewing film scripts and films, reviewing theatrical and musical performance programs, and reviewing publications as a major political responsibility.

Now we are all criticizing bureaucracy, and it seems that we have done too much administrative work, so we have relaxed ideological work. This is one reason, but not a comprehensive reason, and not even the main reason. If you can always grasp the ideological trends in the work process and foresee the development of things, then any administrative work you do will be ideological; if you lack this ideological ability, then even if there is less administrative work, your leadership may not be able to guarantee ideology and foresight. Rather than saying that there is too much administrative work, which hinders ideological work, it is better to say that it is precisely because ideological leadership has not been grasped that we have fallen into the circle of administrative affairs.

Of course, the more streamlined the administration, the better. We must advocate streamlining the administration and simplifying the administration in literary and art administrative work, and require discipline and efficiency in literary and art administrative work. We must resolutely oppose the dangerous tendency in many places to transfer the main creative forces to literary and art administrative work, which is a method of putting the cart before the horse and killing the chicken to get the eggs. Without writers and without works, what is the service object of literary and art administrative work and literary and art organizational work, and what is the necessity of existence? But in any case,
    All personnel engaged in literary and art administrative work cannot use the excuse of too much administrative work to relax their responsibility for ideological work. The cause of the country is developing day by day, and our work tasks will always become heavier and heavier day by day, and the demands of the masses will also increase and improve day by day. It will not work if we do not strive to improve the quality of our work and improve our work methods.

Secondly, we must establish collective and scientific leadership methods. Now our leadership is inspirational and handicraft-style. The main manifestation of this kind of leadership is the lack of planning and inspection, the chaotic work order, and the problems are solved one by one, piece by piece, passively, instead of actively and systematically. Literary and art workers are more accustomed to this kind of personal inspiration work method. We should honestly admit that those of us who are chairmen of literary and art groups, and those who are ministers and bureau directors in cultural institutions, are not very good at using state organs, using mass organizations, using social forces, and adopting scientific methods to do work through the mass line. We still have to learn hard and seriously.

Finally, we must effectively strengthen the work of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations. Now the working conditions of these literary and art groups are extremely abnormal, and there is a widespread phenomenon of being nominal rather than real. In the future, we must make the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations truly become the center of organizing literary and art workers to create and study. These groups should regularly organize literary and art workers to go to the actual struggles of the people, organize the creation and study of literary and art workers, organize extensive creative research and discussions, and boldly launch criticism and self-criticism. Publications must be well run, so that they have a clear combat direction and lively content.

Through this rectification study, let us overcome all the erroneous ideological tendencies in literary and art work, carry forward all the correct and healthy factors, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and art line, make our literary and artistic ranks become a truly combative and strong team!

    整顿文艺思想，改进领导工作
    （十一月二十四日在北京文艺界整风学习动员大会上的讲演）
    周扬
    同志们！关于目前文艺界存在的严重现象，刚才乔木同志已有深刻的、中肯的批评。
    文艺工作中存在的思想混乱的状况，是到了不能再容忍下去，必须加以澄清的时候了。在文艺工作中，以至在文艺领导工作的某些部分中，表现出一种相当浓厚的小资产阶级的思想倾向；如果不纠正这种倾向，毛泽东文艺路线就不能够贯彻，人民文学艺术的事业就不能够前进。由于文艺工作的领导上，放松或放弃了毛泽东文艺思想的领导，放弃了对一切非工人阶级的思想批判、思想斗争和思想改造的工作，这就给了资产阶级、小资产阶级思想以很大的间隙来占领文艺工作的领导地位。问题的严重性就在这里。这也就是电影“武训传”所以能够拍摄、放映以及一度受到盲目赞扬的根源。
    我们的文艺是工人阶级所领导的人民事业的一个重要部分。我们的国家是由工人阶级及其先锋队共产党所领导的，马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想已成为我们国家的领导思想。我们的文学家、艺术家、文艺的领导工作人员，负有以先进的工人阶级的思想、毛泽东思想去教育全体人民的重大的责任，我们应当努力使自己成为像高尔基所说的“阶级的眼睛、耳朵和声音”，“阶级的感觉器官”。如果我们不用工人阶级的思想去武装自己、教育人民，而允许非工人阶级的思想，资产阶级、小资产阶级思想去教育人民的话；如果我们不以一切努力使文艺和自己阶级的政治和广大人民相结合，而允许文艺脱离政治、脱离人民的话；如果我们在文艺工作中，不发展批评与自我批评，而允许自由主义发展的话；那末就不能不说文艺工作的领导方面是犯了严重的错误。即使不是在全部的问题上，而是在部分的问题上犯了这种错误，都是严重的。我，作为文艺工作的主要领导人之一，应当负很大的责任。
    整顿文艺思想，改进领导工作，这就是摆在目前文艺工作日程上的一个迫切的任务。我们必须在这次整风学习中来完成这个任务。
    我们常常讲文艺的思想性。什么叫思想性呢？这就是，文艺应当和最进步的阶级，即工人阶级的思想，他们的世界观、人生观相结合，如果没有这个结合，那末，那样的文艺就不是人民所需要的，就是不能引导人民前进的；那样的文艺就不能在社会生活中起积极的作用。在阶级社会中，文艺总是表现一定阶级的意识，不是表现这一阶级的意识，就是表现那一阶级的意识。因此，在我们前面就有一个任务，必须对文艺作品中所表现的各种不同的思想、情感，以及社会上出现的各种不同的文艺观点，进行一番阶级分析的工作，区别其中那些是工人阶级的思想，那些是小资产阶级、资产阶级甚至封建阶级的思想。
    革命的文艺家、批评家，特别是文艺的领导工作人员，必须具备这种思想辨别的能力，否则就必然会在文艺领域内引起思想的混乱。工人阶级不但要与帝国主义、封建主义划清思想界线，肃清一切帝国主义、封建主义的思想残余，同时也要和人民内部农民阶级、小资产阶级、资产阶级划清思想界线。毛泽东同志早在“新民主主义论”中，就已指出，新民主主义的文化，只能由无产阶级领导，只能由共产主义思想领导，而决不能由任何其他阶级其他思想领导。他在“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中又明确地指出：“真正人民大众的东西，现在一定是无产阶级领导的，资产阶级领导的东西，不可能属于人民大众。”如果在文艺工作中放弃了工人阶级思想的领导，那末，就是容许资产阶级思想的领导；那末，文艺就不是人民的了。毛泽东同志在 “新民主主义论”中曾经指出，中国资产阶级的文化思想比它政治上的东西更落后。资产阶级是早已不能充当文化战线上领导的角色的。在文艺界影响比较最大的是小资产阶级文艺家，他们在政治上是倾向革命的，但是在他们没有经过思想改造以前，他们的思想和艺术作风基本上是属于资产阶级的。他们当然也不可能成为文化战线的领导力量。但是由于资产阶级、小资产阶级在国家政权中的地位，由于在经济上私人资本主义成分和小生产者个体经济成分的存在，资产阶级、小资产阶级思想就还有它相当广大的社会基础，这些思想就不能不在人民事业的各方面（包括文艺方面）顽强地表现出来，而且采取各种“革命”的形式表现出来。因此，工人阶级与资产阶级，特别是小资产阶级划清思想界线，用自己先进的思想去批判、去克服资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想，这就是思想战线上一个长期的斗争的任务。
    毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中说：
    “人民的国家是保护人民的。有了人民的国家，人民才有可能，在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展。”
    这一段话是极端重要的，它指出了文艺工作以及整个思想工作的最中心的、最根本的任务。文艺必须用工人阶级的思想帮助国家来教育人民，帮助人民成长，领导人民向着社会主义和共产主义方向前进。用资产阶级、城市小资产阶级思想，或者用农民阶级思想，能不能够完成这个伟大的历史性的任务呢？那是绝对不能的。
    资产阶级思想嘛，我们在电影“武训传”中领教过了，它宣传的是政治上的反动的改良主义和个人奋斗的路线。这难道和我们所要宣传的人民民主革命思想和集体主义的英雄主义的思想是相容的吗？
    城市小资产阶级思想嘛，我们在小说和电影“我们夫妇之间”中也领教过了，它以知识分子的眼光和趣味歪曲劳动人民的形象，玩味着从旧社会带来的坏思想和坏习惯，把政治庸俗化。这难道和我们在创作上所提倡的，要正确地表现人民中的新的人物和新的思想，要严肃地表现政治主题的要求是能够相容的吗？
    农民阶级思想行吗？不错，解放区的许多文艺作品都是写农民的，写他们的生产和斗争的，但那并不是农民文艺。有些教授把解放区的文艺看成农民文艺，那是错误的。它们写农民，但是它们不是从普通农民的立场，而是从工人阶级的立场来写农民的，它们是用工人阶级的眼光来观察农民的命运，并且表现农民在工人阶级领导下的觉悟过程的。所以这些作品是工人阶级的文艺，如果不是这样的文艺，就不会在人民的运动中发生像“白毛女”“刘胡兰”等剧本所已发生的那样巨大的作用了。表现农民思想的作品也有的，例如有的作品中简单地宣传“发家致富”，就是表现农民思想的，实际上就是宣传资本主义的思想。因此，很明白，我们要教育人民是既不能用资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，也不能用农民思想，而是只能用先进的工人阶级的思想的。
    前年全国文学艺术工作者代表大会开过不久，上海的文艺界就提出了一个可不可以写小资产阶级的问题。毛泽东同志在“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中早就讲过，第一是为工人，第二为农民，第三为士兵，第四为城市小资产阶级，这个地位是摆定了的。问题是在：如何为法？是教他前进呢，就是说，把小资产阶级提高到工人阶级水平呢，还是教他落后，就是说，降低工人阶级的水平去迁就小资产阶级呢？有的人说电影的观众主要是小市民，所以就应该更多地注意小市民。要不要注意小市民呢？当然要的。问题仍然是在：是降低工人阶级的水平去迁就小市民的趣味、思想、爱好呢，还是把小市民的趣味、思想、爱好提高到工人阶级的水平来？我们的国营电影事业，执行了文艺为工农兵服务的方针，没有采取迁就和迎合小市民的做法，那是正确的。
    全国文代大会以后，相当长一个时期，文艺界是“平静”的，没有思想斗争，思想批判。直到“武训传”的讨论，这才打开了文化界，艺术界思想斗争的风气。这一时期，“文艺报”做了一些有益的批评的工作。文艺战线上的斗争，主要就是采取思想批评，文艺批评的方法，用马列主义毛泽东思想及其关于文艺的学说来批评一切错误的文艺思想和作品，以巩固和扩大马列主义文艺思想的领导地位。自然，还有同样重要甚至更重要的一个方法，就是作品竞赛，用前进思想和高度技术相结合的作品去排挤和代替一切思想错误、技术低劣的作品。工人阶级的先进的文艺只有在自由竞赛中，在广大群众的严格的鉴别和考验中才能真正地成长出来。因此，我们必须反对文艺创作上粗制滥造和怠工的现象，因为那样就是削弱和缩小工人阶级文艺的阵地，使人民文学艺术的事业受到损害。
    我们强调思想斗争，思想批判，不是为了削弱文艺上的人民民主统一战线，而正是为了使这个统一战线更加巩固。全国文代大会以来，各方面的文艺工作者之间，党与非党的文艺工作者之间的关系，一般的说是合作的。一个根本缺点是相互间缺少批评，缺少真正诚恳的、坦白的、推心置腹的批评，缺少事业上的相互督促和勉励。我们和非党同志之间，日常工作上的接触多，思想上接触就比较少。党外同志感觉党的同志对他们的帮助不够。什么地方不够呢？我想主要就是在政治上的帮助太少。党外同志也可以帮助我们，我们同样需要他们的帮助，需要向他们学习。他们有比我们许多党员同志更丰富得多的社会经验和艺术经验，他们可以帮助人民和青年的地方是很多的。如果我们在政治上帮助他们的工作做好了，他们也就会更好地来帮助我们的。只有经过这种相互帮助，相互批评，相互督促，才能使我们的关系更亲密更好；是真正好，而不是表面好。
    要达到真正的更好的团结，没有思想改造是不行的。毛泽东同志在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上特别强调地指出了在文化教育战线和各种知识分子中广泛开展自我教育和自我改造的运动的重大意义。根据毛泽东同志的这个指示，这次会议提出了广泛展开思想改造运动，有系统地组织对于马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习作为当前全国人民的中心任务之一。这个任务，对于文艺工作者说来，是格外地重要的。因为文艺工作者的职责就是通过自己的作品去教育人民和改造人民的思想。要教育和改造别人，首先就得教育和改造自己。毛泽东同志在“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，解决了文艺上的许多基本问题。例如文艺与政治的关系，普及与提高的关系等等问题，但是其中一个最根本的问题，就是思想改造。毛泽东同志在那个讲话中用了很形象化的、通俗的语言向所有文艺工作者，尖锐地提出了一个问题：你的“屁股”坐在那一面，如果是坐在小资产阶级方面，就“一定要把屁股移过来”，移到工农兵这方面来。这就是问题的关键。这个关键问题没有解决，什么艺术与政治的关系，普及与提高的关系等等问题，都是不能解决的，如果“解决”了，那都是假的。“屁股”坐在那一方面的问题，也就是立场的问题，这问题解决了，其他的问题也就都可以迎刃而解。许多文艺工作者没有认识思想改造的重要性和必要性。如果我们放弃对文艺工作者的思想改造的工作，那就是去掉“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的革命内容，使这个讲话降低到一切资产阶级、小资产阶级的自由主义者都可以接受的程度；放弃思想改造，就是放弃共产主义的原则立场。因此，每个同志对待思想改造，都应该采取自觉的态度，缺少自觉，是改造不了的。老解放区的经过改造的同志，不要以为自己在延安经过了整风学习，就没有问题了。不是也有老区的经过整风的同志，到了新的环境，在各种资产阶级、小资产阶级思想影响的包围之下，就又露出了自己小资产阶级的尾巴吗？小资产阶级出身的知识分子和小资产阶级之间总是有千丝万缕的联系，不是容易断的，而他们和工农群众之间的联系，却是常常松懈的，容易断的。至于新解放区的没有经过改造的同志，他们的思想感情实际上是根本没有改变的。他们虽然口头上也讲工农兵，心里喜欢的却依然是小资产阶级。一部分老的左翼的文艺工作者还有
    一个自以为很“革命”的包袱（这个包袱我也曾有过的），这就大大地妨碍了他们的进步；必须丢掉这个包袱。今天，全国的文艺工作者绝大部分都是需要改造的。不经过这个改造，向他们要求提高文艺的思想性，如果不是空谈的话，就只能提高他们小资产阶级的思想性。只有经过整风学习，经过思想改造，广大文艺工作者和他们所创造的文艺才会有一个崭新的气象产生出来。
    在目前文艺工作中，存在有一种脱离政治，脱离人民群众的严重倾向。这种倾向，使得文艺工作缺乏蓬勃生气，创作不够旺盛，相当多的文艺作品缺少饱满的情绪。
    两年来，我们的国家经历了巨大的变化和进步——抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革、工人农民的爱国增产运动。对于这些伟大的人民的运动，文艺工作者中，有不少人是参加了的；但也还有许多人没有参加，他们离开这些人民斗争的大风雨远远的。就是参加了这些运动的，很多也都是不深入的，有的简直就是抱着一种单纯的“访问”、“采访”或“搜集材料”的态度。许多文艺工作者对新事物缺乏一种不断地探索和追求的努力；他们对于表现新的生活和新的人物缺乏高度的热情。为什么魏巍同志所写的几个短篇朝鲜通讯，如“谁是最可爱的人？”、“年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧！”、“战士和祖国”等，受到了广大读者的那样热烈的欢迎，引起了他们那样强烈的感动？这就是因为作者在他的作品中传达出了为许多别的作者的作品中所缺少的那样一种鼓舞人心的阶级的热情、群众的热情。他真正探寻了英雄们的心灵深处，他从那里获得了灵感，获得了力量，于是他就用全部生命的力量和热情来歌颂那些英雄们。魏巍同志对于战士们，那些“最可爱的人”们，是熟悉的，他真正爱他们，这就是他的作品能够那样打动人的秘诀。
    我们经常强调文艺应当表现新的生活和新的人物，表现革命的乐观主义和英雄主义，这是十分需要的。但是如果我们不对文艺工作者脱离人民的倾向，进行坚决的斗争，那末，他们是不可能创造出新的人物的英雄形象来的。曾经有各种提倡脱离人民的倾向的错误议论，譬如说，生活是到处都有的，重要的是个人体验，就这样把自己关在个人体验的狭窄的小天地里而自满自足，过着他们所谓的“真正艺术家”的生活。有的作者就在这种安逸生活环境中使自己的头脑迷迷糊糊起来了。在他们中间政治空气渐渐稀薄起来。政治热情开始衰退。他们也到群众的生活当中去，却不是积极地去参加群众的活动和斗争，满腔热情地去关心人民的命运，他们关心的只是自己的创作。他们不是按照生活本身的法则，而是按照书本的法则，如像“剧作法”之类，去表现生活。他们斤斤于在生活中去寻找“戏剧性”的材料。这样，他们怎么能够发掘和表现人民生活中新的人物、新的英雄呢？因此他们在自己作品中处理政治主题的时候把政治庸俗化，描写工农兵，就把工农兵的形象歪曲。他们丧失了他们创作的生命源泉。中央戏剧学院创作室的失败就是这样来的，那正是在文艺工作上脱离政治，脱离人民的必然结果。
    文艺与人民脱离的另一个最严重现象，是一些高级文艺机关和文艺专门家对广大工农群众中蓬勃发展，充满生命力的文艺活动没有加以足够的重视和指导。轻视普及工作的倾向依然存在，没有受到有力的纠正。
    脱离政治的倾向还表现在政治和技术学习的关系上。在我们艺术学校里，有一种忽视政治学习而片面地强调技术学习的偏向。他们把提高艺术性，错误地了解为就是单纯地提高技术，没有了解，提高作品的艺术性是同提高作品的思想性、群众性不能分开的。同时他们又错误地以为学习技术只是单纯学习一些技术的方法。技术的方法是应该学习的。但学习了这些方法，并不等于解决了技术学习中的全部问题甚至主要问题。主要问题，还是在培养文艺学徒一种观察和表现生活的能力，特别是从政治上观察生活的能力。以为技术加上政治就是好作品，这就完全是一种既不懂政治，又不懂艺术的单纯匠人的观点。谁也知道，要创造真正有生命的艺术作品，作者必须广泛地深刻地观察生活，只有人民的生活，才是艺术作品的真实基础。这是现实主义创作方法的根本原则。片面地强调学习技术，又是和盲目崇拜西洋的错误倾向结合着的。这种倾向在我们的艺术学校里是占据相当地位的。一些专家们认为学习技术就是学习西洋，中国是没有什么技术可学的，他们轻视中国民族艺术遗产，没有把对自己民族遗产的整理和研究摆在教学和研究工作的重要地位，这一切表现，都是反人民的、反爱国主义的。
    由于放松或放弃了毛泽东文艺思想的领导，由于文艺工作中存在脱离政治、脱离人民的倾向，其结果，就必然在文艺工作中产生出一种严重的自由主义的作风。在文艺工作者中间几乎没有了批评和自我批评。有些同志开始公开表露厌恶批评的情绪。没有了批评的地方，那里的文艺工作实际上就陷入了停滞状态，并且不可避免地遭到了严重失败。文艺工作者中间的学习很差；既少马列主义理论的学习，又少对业务的钻研。文艺工作者是一种精神劳动者，他们的任务是生产文艺作品这么一种与广大人民有密切关系的精神食粮，他们应当是有劳动纪律的。一个文艺创作机关，或一个文艺作者一年两年没有产生作品，或产生的作品是不能用的，那他就是没有完成生产任务，按劳动纪律讲，就是不允许的。现在我们的文艺工作者中间，这种劳动观念和纪律观念是很差的，或者简直可以说是还没有建立起来的。文艺的队伍，既然没有了战斗观念，劳动观念，纪律观念，就自然而然地涣散起来，失去了战斗目标和战斗力，失去了坚强的领导核心和骨干，文艺也就不成为一条战线了。
    我在以上说了文艺工作中，特别是文艺领导思想上许多严重缺点和错误，同志们也不要以为整个文艺的领导都是一团糟的。无论是在文艺工作领导上，或广大文艺工作者中间，正确的、健康的因素是存在着的，而且起作用的，否则就不能说明两年来我们所已经取得的成绩。问题是领导方面没有很好地发动和组织这个正确的力量，去同那些错误的倾向进行斗争，并以正确的东西去克服错误的东西，因而使得领导的方向成为不明确的，不稳定的，使文艺事业的前进受到了障碍。
    我们要整顿文艺领导思想，就不能不改进文艺领导的具体工作。文艺事业不是个人的事业，而是集体的事业。文艺事业，正如我前面所说的，是国家的人民事业的一个重要部分。文艺事业，除了国家和人民的利益以外，再也不能够有其它任何的利益。所以我们的党，我们的国家，十分注重这个事业。文艺工作者自己的团体应当很好来推动这个事业。
    要改进领导工作方法，就要建立有思想的领导，反对事务主义的领导；就要建立集体的、科学方法的领导，反对个人灵感式的、手工业式的领导。
    所谓无思想的领导，并不是思想上真正成了真空状态，只是缺少工人阶级领导的思想，缺少马列主义与中国革命具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想。既缺少了这一方面的思想，那末，小资产阶级思想及其它一切非工人阶级的思想，就可以很方便地窜到领导的地位来。任何领导工作都应该是有思想的，何况文艺工作本身是关系对千百万人民教育事业的一种思想工作，就更需要具有高度思想性的领导了。现在，我们的文艺事业已经成为具有广大群众性的事业。电影观众已将接近全国人口的数目。文艺刊物过去销行不过几千份，现在十几万、几十万份了，起码也是几万份。我们的文艺已经成为全世界进步文艺的一个重要组成部分了。东方和世界的人民注视我们国家的各方面事业，也注视着我们文艺的事业。我们的国家，由于毛主席的正确领导和在他领导之下全国人民同心协力的奋斗，已经在世界上赢得了这么一种崇高的光荣的地位。我们的国家在军事上、政治上、经济上已经取得了那么多的新的巨大的成就和胜利。我们文艺上的成就和这些一比起来，就显得是太不相称了。我们必须以一切努力使得它更相称一些。我们必须以高度的严肃性和政治责任心来对待文艺这样一种重要思想工作。我们不能容许文艺上粗制滥造的现象，不能丝毫降低我们对于文艺作品的思想要求。由于群众在政治上、思想上和文化上成长了，群众对文艺经常提出批评意见。群众批评，这是文艺领域内的一个新的现象，一个值得十分重视，拍掌欢迎的现象。这表示，人民对文艺的关系和过去的时代完全不同了，他们把文艺当作他们自己的事业，经常提出批评，提出要求。如果我们自己降低对文艺的要求，允许粗制滥造，那就使我们的文艺事业脱离人民和国家的需要。我们是不能够那样的。各方面文艺的领导工作人员，必须把审阅电影剧本和影片，审阅戏剧音乐上演节目，审阅刊物，当作一个重大的政治责任。
    现在我们大家都在批评事务主义，似乎行政事务做得多了，所以就放松了思想工作。这是一方面的理由，但不是全面的理由，甚至不是主要的理由。你如果能够在工作过程中经常掌握思想动态，预见事情的发展的话，那末你做任何行政工作都会是有思想的；如果你缺乏这种思想能力，那末，即使行政工作少，你的领导也不一定能保证具有思想性和预见性的。与其说行政事务多，妨碍了思想工作，不如说，正因为没有抓住思想领导，所以才陷入了行政事务的圈子。
    行政当然是愈简化愈好，我们必须提倡文艺行政工作上的精兵简政，要求文艺行政工作中的纪律性和效率。我们必须坚决反对目前很多地方把主要的创作力量移用到文艺行政工作方面去的危险倾向，这是一种喧宾夺主、杀鸡求卵的办法。没有作家，没有作品，文艺行政工作和文艺组织工作还有什么服务的对象，还有什么存在的必要呢？但是无论如何，
    一切担任文艺行政工作的人员却不能藉口行政事务多而放松了他们对于思想工作的责任。国家的事业是一天一天发展的，我们的工作任务总会一天天繁重的，群众的要求也会一天天增多和提高。我们不努力提高自己工作的质量，改善自己工作的方法，是不行的。
    其次，就是必须建立集体的、科学方法的领导。现在我们的领导是灵感式的、手工业式的。这种领导的主要表现，就是缺乏计划和检查，工作秩序凌乱，问题来了，一个一个零碎地、被动地去解决，而不是主动地、系统地去解决。文艺工作者是比较习惯于这种个人灵感式的工作方法的。我们应当老老实实承认，我们这些在文艺团体做主席的，在文化机关做部长局长的，都还不大会运用国家机关，运用群众团体，运用社会力量，经过群众路线，采取科学方法去做工作。我们还得好好地认真地来学。
    最后，必须切实地加强全国文联和各个协会的工作。现在这些文艺团体的工作情况，是极不正常的，普遍地存在着有名无实的现象。今后必须使得文联和各个协会真正成为组织文艺工作者创作和学习的中心。这些团体应当经常组织文艺工作者到人民的实际斗争中去，组织文艺工作者的创作和学习，组织广泛的创作研究和讨论，大胆展开批评和自我批评。刊物必须办好，要使它们具有明确的战斗方向和生气勃勃的内容。
    经过这次整风学习，让我们克服文艺工作中一切错误的思想倾向，发扬一切正确的、健康的因素，在毛泽东文艺路线的指导之下，使我们文艺的队伍变成为真正具有战斗力的坚强的队伍吧！
