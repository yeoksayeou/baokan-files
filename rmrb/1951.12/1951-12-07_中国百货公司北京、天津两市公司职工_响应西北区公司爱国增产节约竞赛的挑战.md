    Beijing and Tianjin Company Employees of China Department Store Respond to the Northwest District Company's Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Competition Challenge
    The entire staff of the Beijing Company of the State-run China Department Store, based on their own business situation, responded to the challenge of the patriotic labor competition of the Northwest District Company of China Department Store. Their main conditions for accepting the challenge are: (1) Guarantee the completion of the December sales plan, and strive to exceed it by 15%, completing the entire fourth quarter sales task; (2) Guarantee that the commodity circulation cost for the fourth quarter will be reduced by 1.752% compared to the third quarter (a further reduction of 0.74% compared to the originally approved plan), saving the state more than 800 million yuan. To achieve these two conditions, in terms of expanding sales volume: the retail departments mainly overcome the "officialdom" mentality and bureaucratic work style, strengthen publicity and explanation work to customers, and vigorously promote inventory and non-brand-name goods; the wholesale departments mainly reverse the old work style of sitting and waiting for customers, strengthen external contacts, and develop mail-order business, ensuring that sales through these methods account for one-third of wholesale sales. In terms of reducing commodity circulation costs: mainly strengthen the sense of responsibility of employees and carry out the struggle against corruption and waste. Storage and transportation departments should make planned shipments, use various vehicles according to the grade of the goods and the distance of transportation; allocate goods at the station in a planned manner to save handling costs; and at the same time strengthen the management of loading and unloading goods to reduce the loss of goods.
    In order to promote this patriotic labor competition, the company's administration and trade union have signed collective contracts and contact contracts based on the group's patriotic production increase and thrift plans, and mobilized employees to "find tricks" and make rationalization proposals. Now the company's patriotic labor competition has gradually shifted from challenge and response to in-depth development, and many units and individuals have made achievements. For example, the cosmetics department of the First Retail Department had a toothpaste that was not a famous brand but of reasonably good quality. In the past, it could only sell a dozen tubes a day. After the employees of the department studied it, they marked the price and placed it in a prominent position, and sold more than 100 tubes a day; the employees of the silk and satin group of the First Retail Department saw a customer come to buy bedding fabric, and told him where to buy cotton and where to buy lining fabric, which was very convenient for the customer, and they ordered 40 quilts there; the accounting section of the Fourth Retail Department rationally adjusted manpower, and drew one person from the eight people to strengthen external contacts and sales business; the towel group and socks group of the production exchange section of the business section used to collect towels and socks at the same time, and always felt that there was not enough manpower; now the two groups concentrate their efforts, collect towels every other day, and collect socks every other day, the work efficiency has been greatly improved, and they no longer feel that there are fewer people.

    The entire staff of the Tianjin Company of the State-run China Department Store responded to the patriotic labor competition proposed by the staff of the Northwest District Company of China Department Store, and proposed the following conditions for accepting the challenge based on their own business situation: (1) Guarantee the completion of the fourth quarter sales task, and strive to exceed it by 10% (according to the company's fourth quarter task, the actual sales volume will increase by 82% compared with the third quarter), and plan to reduce the inventory figures by 22.22%; (2) Practice strict economy, do not be extravagant or wasteful, reduce the commodity circulation cost in the fourth quarter from the original quota of 3.813 to 3.55, and strive to create a lower quota; (3) Do a good job in clearing property and verifying funds, ensuring that the valuation is correct and the property is true. Complete the final accounts on schedule and lay a solid foundation for next year's economic accounting; (4) Establish internal contact contracts to strengthen the connection between procurement, storage and transportation, customs declaration, sales and other departments, and ensure that there are no delays in reporting, inspection, or sales.
    The employees of the Tianjin Company of the China Department Store launched a patriotic labor competition centered on reducing commodity circulation costs in October. After the efforts of all employees, by the end of October, the commodity circulation cost had been reduced to 3.55% of the commodity turnover, which was 1.08 percentage points lower than the standard of 4.63 approved by the higher authorities. The company's employees have created many effective methods in improving business management and saving expenses. For example, the transportation department of the company sent people to guard the station to handle cargo transfer procedures, and used the method of "changing the order for allocation, and transferring the original vehicle" to avoid the previous eight procedures of inspection, loading and unloading, warehousing, and delivery. Recently, by taking the above-mentioned methods to handle 40 cars of imported goods, it saved more than 60,000 jin of millet in various expenses such as loading and unloading, handling, stacking rent, and insurance. At the same time, the time for transferring goods has also been greatly shortened. The transfer procedures that used to take 15 days or even more than 20 days can now be completed in only 6 hours. Employees have strengthened contact in various business tasks and established mutual assistance groups, which greatly improved work efficiency. The company inspected its inventory once in October, grasped the situation of the inventory goods, and vigorously promoted goods such as printed cloth and cigarettes, as well as the cold and unpopular goods that were cleared out, so that the sales plan for October, which was already 76% higher than that of September, was overfulfilled by 12%. In November, the company, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, checked the brand prices of various commodities and successively lowered the brand prices of more than 90 kinds of wholesale commodities and more than 430 kinds of retail commodities, and vigorously promoted non-brand-name goods and slow-selling goods, so that it completed the sales plan for November ahead of schedule on November 21.

    中国百货公司北京、天津两市公司职工
    响应西北区公司爱国增产节约竞赛的挑战
    国营中国百货公司北京市公司全体职工，根据本身业务情况，响应中国百货公司西北区公司爱国主义劳动竞赛的挑战。他们主要的应战条件：（一）保证完成十二月份的销货计划，并争取超额百分之十五，完成第四季度全部销货任务；（二）保证第四季度商品流转费比第三季度降低百分之一点七五二（较原批准的计划再降低百分之零点七四），为国家节约八亿多元。为实现这两个条件，在扩大销货量方面：门市部主要是克服“官字号”思想与机关化作风，加强对顾客的宣传解释工作，大力推销库存，推销非名牌货；批发部门主要是扭转坐等客上门的旧作风，加强对外联系，开展函购业务，要作到经过这些方法的销货占批发销货额三分之一。在减少商品流转费用方面：主要是加强职工的责任心，开展反贪污反浪费斗争。储运部门要作到有计划地调货，按货品的等级及输送里程使用各种车辆；有计划地在车站分配货物，节省转手费用；同时加强起卸货管理工作，减少商品的损耗量。
    为了推进这次爱国主义劳动竞赛，该公司行政和工会已经在小组爱国增产节约计划的基础上，签订了集体合同和联系合同，并发动职工“找窍门”，提合理化建议。现在该公司的爱国劳动竞赛已由挑战应战逐渐转向深入，不少单位和个人都作出了成绩。例如第一门市部化装部有一种不是名牌而质量不很差的牙膏，过去一天只能卖十几枝，经该部职工研究，标上价钱摆在显要的位置上，一天便卖了一百多枝；第一门市部绸缎组职工看到一位顾客来买被面，便告他说那里可以买棉花，那里可以买被里布，顾客极感方便，就在那里定做了四十条被子；第四门市部会计股合理地调整人力后，从八个人里抽出一个人去加强对外联系和销货业务；营业科生产交换股的毛巾组和袜子组，过去同时收毛巾和袜子，老是感到人力不足；现在两组把力量集中起来，隔一天收毛巾，隔一天收袜子，工作效率大大提高，不再感到人少了。（新华社）
    国营中国百货公司天津市公司全体职工响应中国百货公司西北区公司职工提出的爱国主义劳动竞赛，并根据自己的业务情况提出下列应战条件：（一）保证完成第四季度销货任务，并争取超额百分之十（按该公司第四季度任务比第三季度实销量增大百分之八十二），有计划地将库存数字缩小百分之二十二点二二；（二）厉行节约，不铺张、不浪费，把第四季度商品流转费用由原定额三点八一三降到三点五五，并争取创造更低的定额；（三）作好清理财产、核定资金的工作，保证估价正确、财产真实。按期作好决算工作，打好明年经济核算的基础；（四）订立内部联系合同，加强采购、储运、报关、销售等各个部门的联系，保证不发生滞报、滞验、滞销等现象。
    中国百货公司天津市公司的职工们，在十月份就展开了以减低商品流转费为中心的爱国主义劳动竞赛，经过全体职工的努力，到十月底止，商品流转费已降低到占商品流转额的百分之三点五五，比上级批准的四点六三的标准还低一点零八。该公司职工们在改善经营管理、节约开支等方面已创造了很多有效办法。例如该公司运输部派人驻守车站，办理货物接调手续，用“换单分拨，原车转运”的办法免除了过去检关装卸、入库、出库等八道手续，最近就因为采取上述办法处理四十车进口货物，就节省了装卸、搬运、栈租、保险等各项费用合小米六万多斤。同时，调运货物的时间也大大缩短，过去十五天甚至二十多天才能办完的接调手续，现在只要六小时就可办完。职工们在各种业务工作上都加强了联系，建立了互助小组，工作效率大大提高。该公司在十月份检查了一次库存，掌握了库存货物的情况，大力推销了花布、纸烟等货品和清查出的冷背货，因而使十月份本来就比九月份数量增加了百分之七十六的推销计划，又超额百分之十二完成。十一月份，该公司又根据中央人民政府贸易部的指示，检查了各项商品牌价，先后降低了九十多种批发商品和四百三十多种零售商品的牌价，大力推销了非名牌货和滞销货，因而在十一月二十一日就提前超额完成了十一月份的推销计划。（新华社）
