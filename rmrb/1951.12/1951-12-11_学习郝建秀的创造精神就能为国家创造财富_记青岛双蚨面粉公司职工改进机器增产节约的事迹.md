    The employees of the Qingdao Public-Private Joint Shuangfu Flour Company all admire Hao Jianxiu's creation of advanced work methods that accumulate wealth for the country. However, they generally share a common thought: "Hao Jianxiu is a textile worker, we are flour workers, what is there for us to learn from her?"
    In late June, Xiu Yan, the Chinese Communist Party Branch Secretary of the Shuangfu Flour Mill, addressed the ideological situation of the employees. He explained to all employees at the employee meeting that learning from Hao Jianxiu means primarily learning her spirit of creating advanced work methods. He said, "We must learn Hao Jianxiu's ability to use her brain and her perseverance; and learn from her grasping the main links in her work, researching and improving technology, thereby improving operations." He further emphasized: Advanced workers like Hao Jianxiu can also emerge in the Shuangfu Flour Mill.
    After all the employees clearly recognized that "the spirit of creation of Hao Jianxiu can also be learned in flour mills, and wealth can be created for the country," Kuai Jicheng, the deputy head of the milling workshop's technology team, thought deeply. It turned out that after receiving education through "democratic makeup lessons," he wanted to improve the machines and increase production, but lacked confidence. This time, he held a technical research meeting with the head of the technology team, Wang Zhenye, the acting factory director, Zhou Qintang, and the chairman of the trade union, Wang Mengling, etc., to study how to improve technology based on the actual situation of the factory. At this meeting, everyone spoke freely and earnestly reviewed the main shortcomings of the factory's entire production. Zhou Qintang, who was very familiar with the entire production process of the factory, said: "The most important shortcoming in our production is too much bran, which affects the output of flour." Everyone agreed with his opinion. After the meeting, Kuai Jicheng repeatedly considered the performance of the machines and studied how to reduce bran and increase flour production under the existing conditions. At the second technical research meeting, he said: "If the number of teeth on the mill is reduced and the slope is increased, it may be effective, because this will increase the friction of the mill and increase production efficiency." Everyone thought it could be tested. For the sake of caution, Kuai Jicheng and Wang Zhenye visited the Qilu Flour Mill and recorded the number of teeth and slope of their mill rollers to bring back for reference.
    All the employees of the factory hoped and encouraged Kuai Jicheng and others to improve the mill rollers to succeed as soon as possible. However, Kuai Jicheng was afraid that modifying them badly would cause losses to the country, and he hesitated before the modification. At this time, the CCP branch secretary, Xiu Yan, encouraged them and said: "Go ahead and modify them; to improve machines, you can't get results without practice!" Acting factory director Zhou Qintang also said: "If it is modified badly, it can still be used for grinding corn." With the encouragement and support of the Party and the administrative departments, Kuai Jicheng began to work. After several experiments, he successfully transformed the mill roller in early August. He changed the fourteen teeth of the first pass mill to twelve teeth, and changed the tooth slope of the first, second, third, and fourth pass mills from one and a half inches to three inches. This increased the friction of the mill rollers, which greatly increased the output. According to the September statistics: the monthly flour production increased by 22% compared to the previous month, an increase of 16,800 bags; at the same time, due to the reduction of bran, half a jin more flour was produced per hundred jin of wheat, and the monthly output of flour increased by 25,740 jin; and the monthly task was completed four days ahead of schedule, and electricity and sifting silk, etc. could also be saved.
    The creativity of Kuai Jicheng and others has inspired the production enthusiasm of all the employees of the factory. Now they are fully responding to Chairman Mao's call to continue to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement.

    学习郝建秀的创造精神就能为国家创造财富
    ——记青岛双蚨面粉公司职工改进机器增产节约的事迹
    新华社记者　门宏
    青岛公私合营双蚨面粉公司的职工，都很羡慕郝建秀创造先进工作法给国家积累财富的事迹。可是他们普遍有一个共同的想法：“郝建秀是纺织工人，咱们是面粉工人，向她学习什么呢？”
    六月下旬，中国共产党双蚨面粉厂支部书记修岩，针对着职工们的思想情况，在职工大会上向全体职工说明：向郝建秀学习，首先是学习她的创造先进工作法的精神。他说：“我们要学习郝建秀善于开动脑筋和她的坚毅不挠的精神；并学习她在工作中抓住主要环节，研究和提高技术，从而改进操作。”他又强调提出：在双蚨面粉厂里也能出现像郝建秀那样的先进工人。
    全体职工明确认识了“在面粉厂也可以学习郝建秀的创造精神，也能为国家创造财富”以后，磨粉车间副技术组长蒯基成就左思右想。原来，他经过
    “民主补课”的教育以后，就想改进机器、提高生产，但信心不大。这次，他就和技术组长王振业、代厂长周芹堂、工会主席王梦龄等，开了一个技术研究会，根据厂里的实际情况，研究怎样改进技术。在这个会上，大家你一言、我一语，很热烈地检讨了全厂生产的主要缺点。周芹堂对于厂子里全部生产过程非常熟悉，他说：“咱们生产中最主要的缺点是麸皮多，影响了面粉的产量。”大家都同意他的意见。会后，蒯基成就反复地考虑机器的性能，研究怎样在现有条件下减少麸皮，提高面粉产量的办法。在第二次技术研究会上，他说：“如果将磨的齿数改少、斜度改大，可能有效，因为这样会增加磨的磨擦力，生产效率就会提高。”大家认为可以试验看看。为了慎重起见，蒯基成和王振业等又到齐鲁面粉厂去参观了一次，并把人家的磨辊的齿数和斜度记下来，带回参考。
    全厂职工都热望和鼓励蒯基成等改进磨辊能早日成功。可是蒯基成怕改坏了反而给国家造成损失，临改以前反而犹豫起来。这时中共支部书记修岩就鼓励他们说：“你们改吧，要改进机器，不实践是得不到成果的！”代厂长周芹堂也说：“如果改坏了，还可以留着磨苞米用。”蒯基成在党和行政方面的鼓励和支持下，开始动手，经几次试验，到八月初果然改造成功。他把头道磨十四个齿改为十二个齿，把第一、二、三、四道磨的齿斜度，由一寸半改为三寸，这样就增加了磨辊的磨擦力，因而产量大为提高。据九月份统计：全月面粉产量较前增加百分之二十二，即增加了一万六千八百包；同时因麸皮减少，每百斤小麦多出半斤面，全月多出面粉二万五千七百四十斤；并且一个月的任务提前四天完成，还能节约用电和箩绢等。
    蒯基成等的创造鼓舞了全厂职工的生产热情，现在他们正在全力响应毛主席的号召，继续开展增产节约运动。
