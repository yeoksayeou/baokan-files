Eighth Section Dashes

Interrupted speech. The function of the dash can be divided into several categories. The first category indicates interruption and pause in speech. Examples of interrupted speech:
    (1) Me, Li Shiqing, a real man, I—(lowers his head and says nothing) (Cao Yu)
    (2) (Mrs. Li) You're using your fur coat as a— (Li)
        Don't shout so loud! (Cao Yu)
    (3) You—who told you it was mortgaged? (Cao Yu)
    (4) (Manager Pan to Chen Bailu) It's a pity you didn't see me
        when I was young, at that time—(suddenly to Fu) You have
        nothing to do, what are you doing here, get out! (Cao Yu) (1) and (2) are of one type, the speech stops and does not continue; the difference is that (1) is a voluntary stop, and (2) is interrupted by the other party. (3) and (4) are of one type, the speech stops and then continues; there is also a difference, (3) is speaking to the same person, but the sentence is not finished and another sentence is started, (4) is not finishing speaking to one person and then turning to speak to a second person.

Pause in speech. Using dashes to indicate pause in speech, the most common is: a sentence is already finished, suddenly thinking of something, adding another sentence to limit or supplement the above. For example:
    (5) However, no matter how muddle-headed the writer, listening to him speak,
        it is generally clear, not to the point of being incomprehensible—except
        for lectures that deliberately show off one's abilities. (Lu)
    (6) In ancient times there may have been more, now there is experience, not
        much belief, so fewer people follow suit. —But this
        is my personal guess. (Lu)
    (7) In the past year, we have published nearly two million words, and in terms of content, the most reflects the troops, followed by the countryside, and the least reflects the workers—a total of fifteen pieces. (Qi)

There are other examples where the dash does not indicate additional speech, but rather a pause to build momentum. For example:
    (8) Another period, then—it's possible. But currently—not possible. (Mao Dun, translated)
    (9) This can all be considered true words. However—not entirely. (Lu)
    (10) So watching the young female roles sing, watching the old male roles sing, watching unknown characters sing, watching a large group of people fight chaotically, watching two or three people fight each other, from nine o'clock to ten o'clock, from ten o'clock to eleven o'clock, from eleven o'clock to eleven-thirty, from eleven-thirty to twelve o'clock—but the star is still not here. (Lu)

In these two types of examples, the dashes indicate a longer pause than a comma, but the nature is different from a period, without the effect of separation. If a comma is used, the discontinuity of the tone cannot be expressed; if a period is used, the continuity of the meaning cannot be expressed (examples 8 and 9 cannot even consider using a period). In such places, the dash is the most appropriate symbol. If these conditions are not met, dashes cannot be used indiscriminately. For example:
    (11) To put it indirectly—he is considered a relative of mine. (Book)
    (12) These few battles were so coincidental, as if intentionally giving us a workout in various aspects: the first and second battles—worked out our ability to annihilate the enemy through movement; the third battle worked out our ability to attack fortified positions; the fourth battle gave us a blocking action. (Newspaper)
    (13) ...I stuck my head out of the car window to take a look, I saw a team of Korean women, they—were not wearing pure white skirts, but gray-green military uniforms, their ranks were not very neat, but I saw them—in this cold night, advancing so heroically, some carrying guns, some carrying luggage, they—moved aside to let our car pass, I saw their faces, from their faces I saw not the suffering of war, but a great peace and composure, I understand this composure, only strong and brave people, tempered in war, after the initial shock of the war—hatred has made people resolute, even more resolute. (Newspaper)
    (14) From the above facts, the new literature of thirty years ago—the young era served politics very well. (Education)

There is no reason to use dashes in these sentences. (11) only needs a comma. In (12), after the three "battles", a dash is used in one place, a comma in another, and no punctuation in another. It is not clear why there should be this difference. According to common practice, no punctuation is necessary in these three places. (13) has three places where a dash is used between the subject and the verb, and one place where a dash is used between the verb and the object, and it is impossible to think of any reason for this. If such usage were followed, there would be at least four or five more places in this sentence where a dash could be added, which would only confuse the reader. (This sentence is very long, with sixty-six words before the quoted section. Just considering the portion quoted here, there are already six places where the comma should be changed to a period or semicolon. The "only" in "only strong and brave people" is also not grounded.) (14) Removing the dash still does not solve the problem, perhaps it can be changed to "Thirty years ago, the young era of new literature...".

Hints and Summaries. The second type of usage of the dash is the same as the usage of the colon: to hint at the following text, to summarize or explain the above text.
    (15) The situation at the time, the Jin History Biography of Wang Ruoxu says this—“In the first year of Tianxing, Emperor Aizong fled to Guide…” (Lu)
    (16) (I) Industrial Production (1) State-owned Industry—(omitted below) (2) Private Industry—(omitted below) (II) Commerce (1) Urban-Rural Exchange—(omitted below) (2) Foreign Trade—(omitted below) (Newspaper)
    (17) We are defeating the many with the few—we say this to the entire Chinese ruler. We are also defeating the few with the many—we say this to the various local enemies fighting on the battlefield. (Mao)
    (18) In their articles, you can see people talking to each other—this is the most important thing. (Newspaper)
    (19) What headache, what homework to do, what appointments with people—in short, there is a reason for his absence. (Writing)

(15) and (16) are hinting at the following text, (17) and (18) are explaining the above text, (19) is summarizing the above text. Except for (17), all can be changed to colons. In situations like (15), some people use a colon and then quotation marks, the horizontal arrangement (:—) is not so bad, the vertical arrangement (:—) is very unsightly, and in terms of practical use, there is no need for repetition.

Annotations and Interjections. The annotated parts of an article can also be indicated by dashes, which is the third type of usage of the dash. First, examples using a pair or a single dash:
    (20) The Communist Party must work even harder to win over the working class—the basic force for independence and peace, the pillar of the future France—to united action. (Newspaper)
    (21) The world's new war instigators, who had not yet obtained Berlin at the time, chose the people's democratic countries—including Czechoslovakia—as the target for carrying out their sinister plans. (Newspaper)
    (22) I actually don't like writing new poetry—but I also don't like writing ancient poetry—only because the poetry scene was lonely at that time, so I played along and joined in the fun. (Lu)
    (23) When a bad reporter writes an article—I'm talking about a bad reporter—does he see the readers he wants to move as if they were in front of him? (Newspaper)
    (24) I want to talk a little about my reading as a pastime—just flipping through. (Lu)
    (25) China has long been in two acute fundamental contradictions—the contradiction between imperialism and China, the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of the people. (Mao)

The annotated part should be separated from the main text by a pair of dashes (just as parentheses should also be used in pairs), (24) and (25) only use one dash, because the annotated part is already at the end of the sentence. Do dashes and parentheses, both indicating the annotated part, have different usages? Generally speaking, there is some difference. The annotated part is more important, without which the meaning of the sentence is incomplete, use a dash; less important annotations, just a supplementary explanation, use parentheses. This distinction is not paid much attention to by the general public, so the usage of these two symbols seems a bit chaotic.

But taking (22) and (23) as examples, the part between the dashes is not essential for the completeness of the meaning, so why use dashes instead of parentheses? The middle part of these two sentences is not really a general "annotation", but an "interjection", and interjections are usually indicated by dashes rather than parentheses. Sometimes two commas are also used, see the example in Section 8 of Lecture 4.

When using a dash to indicate the annotated part, it is best to attach it to a place where there can be a pause, so that it is easier to read, as in the example (25), the "imperialism..." is not inserted after "contradiction", because in that case, another dash would have to be used below, plus a lonely "in" or "within", which is not only difficult to read, but also very unsightly. Another example is the two translations of the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace treaty:
    (26a) In order to realize the hopes of hundreds of millions of people around the world—regardless of their views on the causes of the danger of world war—to consolidate peace and ensure international security, we demand that the five major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Britain, and France—conclude a peace treaty. (People's Daily, 1951-02-28)
    (26b) In order to meet the hopes of tens of millions of people around the world, regardless of what views they hold on the causes of the danger of world war, in order to consolidate peace and ensure international security, we demand... (same as above, according to the Usage Examples of Punctuation Marks formulated by the General Administration of Publications, No. 23)
The second one is easier to read. (Changing to two commas may be because there is another pair of dashes below, to avoid confusion.)

Next, we want to talk about the examples where a dash is used before and a comma is used after, such as:
    (27) Countless hordes of slaves—farmers, overturning their man-eating enemies there. (Mao)
    (28) In France, all freedoms—freedom of belief, parade, association, publication, scientific research, etc., have been trampled on without exception. (Newspaper)
This can only be used when a noun annotates a noun (i.e., forming an appositive relationship). Even in this kind of place, a pair of dashes or two commas can still be used. If the annotated part is a sentence or phrase, it is absolutely inappropriate to use this format, as this is prone to causing confusion in meaning. For example:
    (29) ...if Pakistan gets greater benefits from trade with China—experience has proven that this is actually the case, then under no circumstances should this boycott plan be supported. (Newspaper)
    (30) As for those "continental kings"... in the large areas they rule—they occupy most or part of a dozen to dozens of hamlets, stretching for dozens of miles, the peasants are their slaves, allowing them to rob and kill. (Education)

In (29), after "this is actually", and in (30), after "dozens of miles", a dash should be used. If even the comma after is omitted, then it is even more unacceptable. For example:
    (31) They can make weapons, but cannot make—to put it more precisely, cannot control people's minds. (Newspaper)

There should be a dash after "control". It is best to omit the comma after "point", and use two commas after "make" and "control", because strictly speaking, this is not an annotation, but a "split-combine type" (see Section 8 of Lecture 4).

Even if the dash is preceded and followed by nouns, whether the dash is used properly should still be considered. For example:
    (32) I transported his remains back and buried them in his hometown—Moscow, next to Suya's grave. (Periodical)
    (33) But the largest city in the Far East—Shanghai, is still ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the running dogs of American imperialism. (Newspaper)

In these two sentences, rather than saying that the part after the dash is an annotation of the part before, it is better to say that the part before is a description of the part after. The general custom is not to use a dash to express this relationship, because there is no pause when speaking. For example: "The philosopher Zhu Xi of the Song Dynasty wrote many books..." (Mao), there is no dash between "philosopher of the Song Dynasty" and "Zhu Xi". There should also be no dashes in the above two sentences. If it is said that there can be a slight pause before and after "Shanghai" in (33), then only two commas can be used.

Next, we want to discuss examples similar to the situations in (27) and (28) but without a comma after. Such as:
    (34) Chairman of the conference—Director Lin Kengsheng of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's Beijing Office delivered the opening remarks. (Newspaper)
    (35) This labor insurance regulation, like the trade union law, is one of the major revolutionary victories achieved by the Chinese working class under the leadership of its own political party—the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, after a long and heroic struggle. (Newspaper)

In the past, two commas, one before and one after, were generally used in this kind of place. Now, a dash is used before, and no symbol is used after due to concerns about structural coherence. In fact, when speaking, if there is no pause, there is none before and after; if there is a pause, there is one before and after. We feel that it is better to consider the situation and use two commas, or no symbol at all.
    (36) More than 6,000 monks, laypeople, and People's Liberation Army soldiers in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, which has returned to the embrace of the motherland—held a rally in the square in front of the Potala Palace on the 1st to warmly celebrate National Day. (Newspaper)
    (37) When driving out for the first time after the internship period, because of the negligence of another companion—Feng Xiaomei, who was complacent and panicked in the face of the situation, the car was delayed. (Periodical)
The relationship between the dash and the words before and after it in these two sentences is the same as in (32) and (33), and there is a "的" character continuing on, so it is appropriate to use no symbol.
    (38) He works for the people—the welfare of all creators and owners of material and spiritual values. (Newspaper)
    (39) These plans fully illustrate how different socialist countries—the Soviet Union and capitalist countries—the United States are. (Periodical)

The relationship between the dash and the words before and after it in these two sentences is the same as in (27) and (28), but the subsequent structure cannot be separated. However, using a single dash is ultimately not a good solution, especially (39), because two dashes can lead people to misunderstand that it is a pair. If we only think about the symbol, (38) can add a dash after "owner" (making it purely a written thing, as in example (20) above), and (39) can only use commas before and after "Soviet Union" and "United States". But these two sentences can be solved in ways other than just the symbol: (38) can be changed to "He works for the people, for all..." (39) can be changed to "...illustrates how different the Soviet Union, as a socialist country, and the United States, as a capitalist country, are." Don't think that sentences cannot be changed once they are written down. If there are difficulties with punctuation, you can think about sentence construction.
    (40) A bad reporter does not strive to use his own words to speak, but uses some kind of language that he considers polite—formal, vulgar, and rigid. (Newspaper)

The dash in this sentence does not express what the author wants to say and should be changed to ", but is actually". This example illustrates one thing: don't ask punctuation marks to perform tasks they cannot perform.
    
To summarize this section: the dash is a very prominent punctuation mark and should not be overused. If a comma can be used, use a comma; if no symbol is needed, then no symbol should be used. What needs to be dispelled in particular is the misunderstanding that if two words before and after refer to the same thing (appositive relationship), a dash should be used in the middle. This is a very incorrect view. The function of the dash should be recognized as "breaking" and not "connecting," the same as a general sentence comma.
    
Other uses of dashes. The dash is also used in: 1. Before and after a subtitle, or only before. For example: (41) On the People's Democratic Dictatorship—In Commemoration of the Twenty-Eighth Anniversary of the Communist Party of China—(Mao) (42) History in Battle—Commenting on Feng Xuefeng: Village Style and City Style (Zhu Ziqing)

Subtitles do not necessarily have to have dashes. For example, Mao Zedong's "On Practice" subtitle "On the Relationship Between Knowledge and Practice—The Relationship Between Knowing and Doing" does not have a dash before it.
    
2. Indicate the source after a quotation. For example:
    (43) Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death.
                                    —Du Fu.

Here, the dash has the same function as parentheses. The dash is probably used when the quotation is in a separate paragraph and the source is on a separate line, otherwise parentheses are used.
    
3. To explain the annotator, after the annotation. For example:
    (44) Later, these malpractices were more firmly influenced by Western European scholars of the idealist school of thought, such as Green (T.H. Green, the founder of the British Neo-Kantian and Neo-Hegelian schools—translator). (Periodical)
    
4. To replace quotation marks. For example:
    (45) —Ah, Caesar, when did you arrive? —Auntie, mom asked you to go. (Guo Liangfu)

In French and Russian publications, although quotation marks are also used, dashes are generally used as quotation marks. In our publications, quotation marks are still used more often and dashes are used less often.
    
5. Used between two numbers, to mean "to". For example: (46) There was Feng Dao's (882-954 AD) carved woodblock of the Nine Classics, and then Bi Sheng's invention of movable type between 1041-1048. (Periodical)
    
Commas and periods before dashes. Should there be a comma or a period before the dash? If a dash is used, should these commas and periods still be there? Checking the example sentences above, there are two examples where a comma is used (7, 8), and one example where a period is used (6). Contrary to these three examples, there are ten places where a comma could be used but is not (5, 10, 11, 21-25, 29, 30), and there are also two places where a period could be used but is not (17, 18). This shows that the general understanding is that commas and periods can be omitted if there is a dash. The period in example (6) may have been intentionally used to more clearly express the "additional" nature of what comes after the dash. In example (44), the annotation is placed in parentheses and inserted in the middle of the article, so there is no period. If the annotation is attached to the end of the article, without parentheses, then there should be a period after "creator" and "translator". (End of this section, full text not completed)

    语法、修辞讲话（第六讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第八段    破折号
    说话中断。破折号的作用可以分做几类来说。第一类表示说话的中断和停顿。说话中断的例子：
    （一）我，李石清，一个男子汉，我——（低头不语）（曹禺）
    （二）（李太太）你又把你的皮大衣当——（李）
        你不要这么大声嚷嚷！（曹禺）
    （三）你——谁跟你说押给人了？（曹禺）
    （四）（潘经理对陈白露）可惜，你没有瞧见我
        年青的时候，那时——（忽然向福）你没有
        事，在这儿干什么，出去！（曹禺）（一）（二）是一类，中断之后不再说下去；所不同者，（一）是自动地不说下去，（二）是被对方打断。（三）（四）是一类，中断之后又说下去；也有分别，（三）是对同一个人说话，不过一句未了又另起一句，（四）是对一个人的话没说完又转过来对第二个人说话。
    说话停顿。用破折号表示说话停顿，最常用的是：一句话已经完了，忽然想起，再找补一句，对于上文加以限制或补充。例如：（五）然而无论怎样的胡涂文作者，听他讲话，
    却大抵清楚，不至于令人听不懂的——除了
    故意大显本领的讲演之外。（鲁）（六）古时候也许还要多，现在是有了经验，不
    大相信了，于是照办的人也少了。——但这
    是我个人的推测。（鲁）（七）一年来，我们发表作品的字数近两百万，内容比重，则反映部队的最多，反映农村的次之，反映工人的最少，——共十五篇。
    （期）另有一些例子，那里面的破折号不是表示追加说话，乃是表示顿挫取势。例如：（八）另一个时期呢，——可以。可是目前—— 不能。（茅盾，译文）（九）这都可以算是真实话。然而——也不尽然。（鲁）（十）于是看小旦唱，看老生唱，看不知什么角色唱，看一大班人乱打，看两三个人互打，从九点多到十点，从十点到十一点，从十一点到十一点半，从十一点半到十二点——然而叫天竟还没有来。（鲁）这两类例子里面的破折号，都表示比逗号更长的停顿，可是跟句号的性质又不同，没有隔断的作用。如果用逗号，就不能表示语气的不连贯；如果用句号，又不能表示意思的连贯（八、九两例根本不能考虑到用句号）。这种地方，破折号是最适当的符号。如果不具备这种条件，就不能乱用破折号。例如：（十一）转弯抹角算起来——他算是我的一个亲戚。（书）（十二）这几次战役是这么巧，好像有意地在各方面锻炼我们一下：第一、二次战役——锻炼了我们的运动歼敌，第三次战役，锻炼了攻坚，第四次战役又来了一个阻击。（报）（十三）……我从车窗上伸出头来看了看，我看到一队朝鲜妇女，她们——穿的不是洁白的裙子，而是灰绿色的军装，她们的行列不算怎样整齐，但是我看见她们——在这寒夜之下，向前行进着是那样豪迈，她们有的背着枪，有的就肩着行囊，她们——向公路一边让开我们的车，我看见她们的脸，从她们的脸上我看见的不是战争的苦难，而是十分安详与镇定，我懂得这种镇定，只有坚强勇敢的人们，在战争的锻炼下，他们经过了——战争开始突然袭击之下的震惊，仇恨使人们变得坚决、更坚决了。（报）（十四）从上面事实看来，三十年前的新文学——年轻的时代是为政治服务得非常好的。（教）这几句都没有理由用破折号。（十一）只要用逗号。（十二）的三个“战役”之后，一处用破折号，一处用逗号，一处不用标点号。看不出为什么要有这个分别。照通常的习惯，这三处都不必用标点号。（十三）有三处在主语和动词之间用破折号，有一处在动词和宾语之间用破折号，都想不出有什么道理。要照这样的用法，这一句里至少还有四五处可以加破折号，结果会使读者十分迷惑。（这一句非常长，在引文之前已有六十六个字。单就这里所引的一部分说，已经有六处的逗号应该改用句号或分号。“只有坚强勇敢的人们”的“只有”也没有着落。）（十四）取消破折号还是不能解决问题，也许可以改做“三十年前，新文学年轻的时代，”。
    提示和总结。破折号的第二类用法跟冒号的用法相同：提示下文，总结或说明上文。
    （十五）当时的情状，金史王若虚传这样说——“天兴元年，哀宗走归德。……”（鲁）（十六）（一）工业生产（1）国营工业——（下略）（2）私营工业——（下略）（二）商业（1）城乡交流——（下略）（2）对外贸易——（下略）（报）（十七）我们是以少胜多的——我们向整个中国
    统治者这样说。我们又是以多胜少的——我
    们向战场上作战的各个局部的敌人这样说。
    （毛）（十八）他们在文章后面，可以见到人与人在讲
    话——这是最重要的。（报）（十九）什么头疼啦，什么有习题要做啦，什么跟人有约会啦——总之，他的不到会是有理由的。（作）（十五）（十六）是提示下文的，（十七）（十八）是说明上文的，（十九）是总结上文的。除（十七）外，都可以改用冒号。像（十五）的情形，还有人用了冒号又用引号，横行（：——）还不怎么样，直行（：——）非常难看，而就实用说，也没有重复的需要。
    注释和插说。文章中的注释的部分也可以用破折号来表示，这是破折号的第三类用法。首先是用一对或一个破折号的例子：（二十）共产党就必须更加努力，争取工人阶级——独立与和平的基本力量，未来法国的支柱——的行动统一。（报）（二一）世界上的新战争挑拨者们，当时还没有得到了柏林，他们就选择了人民民主国家——包括捷克斯洛伐克在内——作为进行自己罪恶计划的目标。（报）（二二）我其实是不喜欢做新诗的——但也不喜欢做古诗——只因为那时诗坛寂寞，所以打打边鼓，凑些热闹。（鲁）（二三）当一个坏的记者写文章的时候——我说的是坏的记者——他是不是看到他所要感动的读者如在面前呢？（报）（二四）我想讲一点我的当作消闲的读书——随便翻翻。（鲁）（二五）中国很久以来就是处在两种剧烈的基本的矛盾中——帝国主义和中国之间的矛盾，封建制度和人民大众之间的矛盾。（毛）注释的部分应该用一对破折号跟正文分开（犹之括号也要用一对），（二四）（二五）只用一个破折号，那是因为注释的部分已在句子末了。破折号和括号都表示注释的部分，用法有分别没有呢？一般说来，有点分别。注释的部分比较重要，少了它句子的意思不完整的，用破折号；比较不重要的注释，只是一种附带说明，用括号。这个区别，一般人不很注意，所以这两种符号的用法显得有点乱。
    可是以（二二）（二三）这两句而论，破折号中间的部分，对于意思的完整并非必不可少，为什么用破折号不用括号呢？这两句的中间部分实在不是一般的“注释”，而是一种“插说”，插说照例不用括号而用破折号。有时也用两个逗号，参看第四讲第八段的例句。
    用破折号表示注释的部分，最好凑在能停顿的地方，读起来才方便，如（二五）例的“帝国主义……”就没有插在“矛盾”之后，因为那样一来，下面又得用个破折号，再加上个孤零零的“中”或“之中”，不但不好读，而且很难看。又如世界和平理事会关于缔结和平公约的宣言的两种译文：（二六甲）为了实现全世界亿万人民——不论他们对世界战争危险发生的原因所持的见解如何——所怀抱的希望，为了巩固和平与保障国际安全，我们要求五大国——美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国及法国——缔结和平公约。（人民日报，五一、二、二八）（二六乙）为了符合全世界千千万万人们的希望，不论他们对于造成世界战争危险的原因抱什么见解，为了巩固和平与保障国际安全，我们要求……（以下同前，据出版总署订定的标点符号用法例二十三）第二种就好读些。（改用两个逗号，也许是因为底下又有一对破折号，避免混淆。）
    其次要说的是前用破折号后用逗号的例子，如：
    （二七）无数万成群的奴隶——农民，在那里打
        翻他们的吃人的仇敌。（毛）
    （二八）在法国，一切自由——信仰、游行、结
        社、出版、科学研究等自由，都被蹂躏无
        遗。（报）这只能用在以名词注释名词（即构成同位关系）的时候。就是在这种地方，也还是可以用一对破折号或两个逗号。假如注释的部分是句子或短语，绝对不宜于用这种格式，这是容易引起意义的混乱的。例如：（二九）……如果由于与中国贸易，巴基斯坦得到更大的好处——经验证明实际上是这样的，那末，在任何情况下，绝不应支持这种抵制计划。（报）
    （三十）至于那些“洲土大王”……在他们所统治的大块地区上——他们都霸占着十几个到几十个垸子的大部或一部土地，延绵达数十里，农民就是他们的奴隶，任他们抢掠和屠杀。（教）
    （二九）“这样的”之后，（三十）“数十里”之后，都应该用破折号。如果连后面的逗号也省了，那就更加要不得。例如：
    （三一）他们能够制造武器，但不能制造——说
        的更确切一点，是不能控制人的思想。（报）“控制”之后该有破折号。最好是把“一点”之后的逗号省掉，在“制造”之后和“控制”之后用两个逗号，因为这里严格说并不是注释，而是一种“分合式”（参看第四讲第八段）。
    就是破折号的前面和后面都是名词，这个破折号是否用得得当，也还是应该考虑的。例如：
    （三二）我把他的遗体运回，安葬在故乡——莫
        斯科，和苏雅的墓并列。（期）
    （三三）但远东最大的城市——上海，还在被美
        帝国主义的走狗蒋匪帮统治着。（报）这两句里边，与其说破折号后面的部分是注释前面的，不如说前面的部分是形容后面的。这种关系，一般的习惯是不用破折号来表示，因为说话的时候没有停顿。例如：“宋朝的哲学家朱熹，写了许多书……”（毛），“宋朝的哲学家”和“朱熹”中间就没有破折号。上面这两句里边也是不应该有破折号的。假如说，（三三）的“上海”前后说起来也可以有小小停顿，那末，也只能用两个逗号。
    再其次要讨论一下和（二七）（二八）的情形相似而后面没有逗号的例子。如：
    （三四）大会主席——台湾民主自治同盟驻京办
        事处主任林铿生致开会词。（报）
    （三五）这个劳动保险条例，也与工会法一样，
        是中国工人阶级在自己的政党——中国共产
        党和毛主席的领导之下，经过了长期的英勇
        斗争，所获得的重大的革命胜利果实之一。
        （报）从前，这种地方一般是用一前一后两个逗号。现在前面改用破折号，而后面因为顾虑到结构上的连贯性，没有用任何符号。事实上，说话的时候，如果没有停顿，前后都没有；如果有停顿，前后都有。我们觉得不如还是斟酌情形，用两个逗号，或是不用符号。
    （三六）回到祖国怀抱的西藏首邑——拉萨的僧
        俗人民及人民解放军六千余人，于一日在布
        达拉宫前的广场上举行集会，热烈庆祝国庆
        节。（报）
    （三七）在实习期满第一次驾车出去的时候，因
        为另外一个由于骄傲自满而临事惊惶失措的
        同伴——冯小妹的疏忽，使车子误了点。
        （期）这两句破折号前后的关系和（三二）（三三）相同，而后面又有“的”字连下去，以不用符号为宜。
    （三八）他是为人民——一切物质和精神价值的
        创造者和所有者的福利而工作。（报）
    （三九）这些计划充分说明了社会主义国家——
        苏联与资本主义国家——美国是怎样的不
        同。（期）这两句破折号前后的关系和（二七）（二八）相同，但后面的结构割不断。可是用一个破折号终归不是好办法，（三九）尤其不好，因为两个破折号会使人误会是一对。如果只在符号上想办法，（三八）可以在“所有者”后面加个破折号（让它成为纯属书面的东西，前面（二十）例就是如此），（三九）只能在“苏联”和“美国”前后各用逗号。但是这两句是可以在符号以外想办法的：（三八）可以改做“他是为人民，为一切……而工作”，（三九）可以改做“……说明了苏联这样的社会主义国家与美国这样的资本主义国家是怎样的不同”。不要以为句子写下来就不能改，如果标点上有为难的地方，可以再在造句上想想法子。
    （四十）不好的记者并不努力于使用自己的话语
        来讲话，而是用某种他认为是彬彬有礼的—
        公式的，庸俗的，刻板的语言来讲话。（报）这一句的破折号并不能表示作者要说的意思，应该改做“，而实在是”。这个例子说明一件事：不要叫标点符号担任它所不能担任的职务。
    总结这一节的意思：破折号是个很突出的标点符号，不宜多用。可以用逗号，不如用逗号；可以不用符号，不如不用符号。尤其需要破除的误会是：如果一前一后的两个词语所指相同（同位关系），中间要用破折号。这是很不正确的看法。要认清破折号的作用是“断”不是“连”，跟一般句逗号相同。
    破折号的其他用途。破折号又用在：一，副标题的前面和后面，或只用在前面。例如：（四一）论人民民主专政——纪念中国共产党二十八周年——（毛）（四二）历史在战斗中——评冯雪峰：乡风与市风（朱自清）副标题也不是非加破折号不可，如毛主席“实践论”的副标题“论认识和实践的关系——知和行的关系”前面就没有破折号。
    二，引文后面注明出处。例如：
    （四三）朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨。
                                    ——杜甫。这里的破折号的作用跟括号相同。大概引文另段并且出处另行的用破折号，否则用括号。
    三，注释后，说明注释者。例如：（四四）而后来这些弊病受了唯心论气派的西欧
    学者们如格林（T·H·Green，英国新康
    德学派和新里格尔派的创始者——译者）给
    他的影响，是更形牢固了。（期）四，代引号。例如：（四五）——啊，凯萨，你们什么时候来的？——阿姨，妈妈叫你去呢。（郭良夫）法文和俄文书刊里，虽然也有用引号的，一般都是拿破折号作引号用。在我们的书刊里，还是用引号的多，用破折号的少。五，用在两个数目字中间，代“到”。例如：（四六）前有冯道（纪元八八二——九五四）之雕刻九经木版，后有毕升在一○四一——一○四八年间之发明活版。（期）破折号前面的句逗号。破折号的前面原来该有句逗号，用了破折号之后，这些句逗号是不是还要呢？在前面这些例句里检查，有两个例子是用了逗号的（七、八），有一个例子是用了句号的（六）。跟这三个例子相反，可用逗号而不用的有十处（五、十、十一、二一——二五、二九、三十），可用句号而不用的也有两处（十七、十八）。可见一般的了解是有了破折号就可以省掉句逗号。像例（六）的句号也许是有意用上的，这样就把破折号以后的“追加”性质表示得更清楚。（四四）例的注释放在括号里，插在文章的中间，所以没有句号。如果这个注释是附在文章后面，不用括号，那末，“创造者”之后和“译者”之后都应该有句号。（本段完，全文未完）
