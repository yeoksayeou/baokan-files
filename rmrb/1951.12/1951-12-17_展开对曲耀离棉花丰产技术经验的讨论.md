    Expand the Discussion on Qu Yaoli's Cotton High-Yielding Technology Experience

    Since this newspaper published Qu Yaoli's cotton high-yielding technology experience, it has attracted the attention of agricultural production leading cadres and the broad masses of farmers in various regions. All localities should appropriately absorb these experiences in light of their specific local conditions and strive to increase the unit area yield of cotton fields.

    Some of Qu Yaoli's high-yield technology experiences can be universally promoted. For example, Qu Yaoli's experiences in preserving soil moisture and preventing drought, ensuring full seedling emergence, applying large amounts of organic fertilizer, implementing light and frequent irrigation, and appropriately implementing close planting can all be promoted on a wide scale. However, some of Qu Yaoli's special high-yield experiences, such as his land preparation methods, are not suitable for universal promotion. This is because this method was created by Qu Yaoli to improve the nature of his slightly alkaline soil. This method cannot be used for land that is not slightly alkaline.

    Promoting Qu Yaoli's advanced technical experience requires an ideological struggle. We must use advanced experience to overcome some conservative and backward habits. For example, appropriately implementing close planting is an important factor for Qu Yaoli to obtain high yields. However, some areas have in the past vigorously advocated sparse planting; promoting Qu Yaoli's high-yield experience in these areas will inevitably encounter widespread ideological resistance. As far as we know, some cadres and the masses in some areas have expressed resistance and doubt about this. Therefore, it is now very necessary to launch a discussion on Qu Yaoli's high-yield experience. Otherwise, Qu Yaoli's advanced experience cannot be smoothly promoted in these areas.

    This research and discussion should not be limited to the agricultural leadership organs in various regions, but must be widely carried out in agricultural technology training classes and winter schools in various cotton-producing areas, and among the broad masses of cotton-producing areas. We must thoroughly open up the minds of cadres and the masses, so that the broad masses of cadres and the masses can consciously learn and accept these advanced technical experiences. It is hoped that all localities will promptly inform this newspaper of the various controversies and doubts that occur in the discussion; this newspaper is willing to cooperate with relevant agencies to be responsible for answering them.

### 展开对曲耀离棉花丰产技术经验的讨论

    展开对曲耀离棉花丰产技术经验的讨论
    本报发表了曲耀离的棉花丰产技术经验后，已引起各地农业生产领导干部和广大农民的重视。各地应当结合当地具体情况，适当地吸收这些经验，为提高棉田单位面积产量而斗争。
    曲耀离的若干丰产技术经验，是可以普遍推广的。例如：曲耀离的保墒防旱、保证全苗，大量施用有机肥料，实行轻浇勤浇的灌溉方法，适当地实行密植等经验，都是可以在广大范围内推广的。但是，曲耀离的若干特殊的丰产经验，例如他的整地方法，却不适宜普遍推广。因为这种方法，是曲耀离为了改善他的轻碱性土地的性质而创造出来的。凡不是轻碱性的土地，都不能采用这种方法。
    推广曲耀离的先进技术经验，需要进行一番思想斗争。必须用先进经验，战胜若干保守的落后的习惯。例如，适当地实行密植，是曲耀离获得丰产的重要因素。但是，有些地区，过去曾经极力提倡稀植；在这种地区推广曲耀离的丰产经验，一定会遭到广泛的思想抵抗。据我们所知，有些地区的干部和群众，对这已表示抵抗和怀疑。因此，展开一个关于曲耀离丰产经验的讨论，现在是十分必要的。否则，曲耀离的先进经验，就不可能在这些地区顺利推广。
    这种研究和讨论，不能仅仅限制在各地的农业领导机关，必须在各产棉区的农业技术训练班和冬学中，在广大的产棉区群众中广泛进行。务求彻底打通干部和群众的思想，使广大干部、群众自觉地学习和接受这些先进技术经验。希望各地及时把讨论中发生的各种争论和怀疑之处，告诉本报；本报愿协同有关机关，负责予以解答。
