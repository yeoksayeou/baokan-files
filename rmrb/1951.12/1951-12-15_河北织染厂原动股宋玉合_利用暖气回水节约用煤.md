    Song Yuhe of the Hebei Textile and Dyeing Factory's Power Section
    Saves Coal by Utilizing Radiator Return Water
    Comrade Editor: Song Yuhe (a Communist Party member), the deputy section chief of the Power Section of the Hebei Textile and Dyeing Factory, after reading Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy in the newspaper, suggested to the administration that return water pipes be installed to utilize the factory's radiator return water. At the time, although he had a stomach ailment, he still successfully installed the return water pipe in seven days. In the past, the radiator water in the factory flowed into the underground passage through the drain pipes. He blocked all the drain pipes and added a water pipe connecting to the water collection pool in the boiler room, and then used a water pipe to connect the water collection pool to the boiler. In this way, the boiler's steam is used to drive the machine to automatically pump the water from the collection pool into the boiler. Before utilizing the return water, the workshop's radiator consumed 110 jin of coal per hour; after utilizing the return water, it consumed 90 jin of coal per hour. This saves 480 jin of coal per day and 14,400 jin of coal per month. Based on the assumption that the radiator is used for five months of the year, it can save 72,000 jin of coal. In addition, because the return water is pure, it can extend the service life of the boiler. Zhu Fushen Huang Yi

    河北织染厂原动股宋玉合
    利用暖气回水节约用煤
    编辑同志：河北织染厂原动股副股长宋玉合（共产党员），在报上看到毛主席增产节约的号召后，就向行政方面建议，要安装回水管来利用工厂的暖气回水。当时他虽有肠胃病，但他仍在七天内把回水管装置成功。过去，工厂内的暖气流水，顺着放水管流往地道。他把各处放水管堵死，增加一个水管通到锅炉房的积水池，再用水管由积水池通往锅炉。这样，利用锅炉的蒸汽，带动机器自动使积水池的水打入锅炉。利用回水前，工场暖气每小时用煤一百一十斤；利用回水后，每小时用煤九十斤。每天可以节约煤四百八十斤，每月节约煤一万四千四百斤。按全年用暖气五个月计算，就能节约煤七万二千斤。另外，因回水质量纯洁，可以延长锅炉使用年限。　朱福申　黄　毅
