    The Industry Section of the General Affairs Department of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau
    Should Examine Bureaucratic Work Styles
    To the Editor: The Industry Section of the General Affairs Department of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau established a surveying team in November of last year. When the surveying team members measured the roadbed, they did not use scientific surveying instruments, relying only on visual estimation. They wrote down whatever number of meters they estimated. Yu Huaiyou, the head of the Industry Section, allowed them to work in this manner. During the selection of model teams in February of this year, it was discovered that 30% of their roadbed measurements were incorrect, requiring re-examination and rework. The roadbeds of the Linmi Line and Donghai Station, among others, were still not accurately measured after rework and are still under review. Our initial calculations show that over the past year, more than 90 million yuan has been wasted on wages and production costs, and more than 5 million yuan has been wasted on drafting paper and other materials. These losses are due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Industry Section. The Qiqihar Railway Bureau should investigate this matter.

    齐齐哈尔铁路局总务处产业科
    应检查官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：齐齐哈尔铁路管理局总务处产业科，在去年十一月成立了一个测量队。测量队人员测量路基时，不使用科学的测量仪器，只凭眼睛估计。他们估计多少公尺，就写上多少公尺。产业科长于怀有，听任他们用这种方法工作。今年二月评选模范组时，发现他们测量的路基，有百分之三十都错了，必须复查返工。林密线、东海站等路基，返工后仍然没有测准，到现在还在复查。我们初步计算了一下，一年来在工资和生产费上面，共浪费了九千多万元，在绘图纸等材料方面，浪费了五百多万元。这些损失都是因为产业科领导干部的官僚主义作风造成的，齐齐哈尔铁路管理局应检查这件事。
