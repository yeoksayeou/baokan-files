Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 14th: On December 14th, the delegation of our side in the Korean armistice negotiations, in the spirit of reasonably resolving the differences between the two sides on the third agenda item, proposed six proposals (attached below) at the subcommittee on the third agenda item, suggesting that the subcommittee carefully consider and accept this proposal as a principle agreement to resolve the third agenda item. At the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, our representative continued to refute the other side's unreasonable attitude of insisting on exchanging prisoner-of-war information and inviting the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoner-of-war camps as preconditions for discussing the fourth agenda item, and refusing to discuss our side's principled proposal for the prompt release and repatriation of all prisoners of war. Our representative pointed out that our side is fully prepared to exchange all information related to prisoners of war, but the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice must first be determined, because this is the most important and fundamental issue of the fourth agenda item, and the only reasonable principle. Our representative continued to question the other side: If the principle of both sides releasing all prisoners of war is not determined, what is the need to exchange the names of all prisoners of war? Even the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War clearly stipulates that all prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after the cessation of hostilities, without any delay. If the other side is unwilling to abide by this basic principle, what qualifications does it have to invoke the Geneva Convention to insist on its demand for the International Red Cross to visit prisoner-of-war camps? The main task of the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item is to determine the principle that both sides will immediately release and repatriate all prisoners of war after the armistice is realized, and to negotiate specific steps based on this principle, so that prisoners of war can return home as soon as possible and enjoy peaceful lives. Our representative sharply questioned the other side: Is it more important to determine the principle of releasing all prisoners of war and specifically arranging for prisoners of war to return home as soon as possible, or is it more important to not determine the principle of releasing all prisoners of war and letting them stay in prisoner-of-war camps to be visited? Our side firmly believes that the former issue is undoubtedly more important and should be discussed first. In order to ensure that the fourth agenda item can be quickly agreed upon without further delay, our representative pointed out that the other side should express its attitude towards our principled proposal and conduct discussions to lay the foundation for resolving the fourth agenda item.

The full text of our side's six proposals is as follows:

	(1) All armed forces under the control of both sides, including regular and irregular forces and armed personnel of the army, navy, and air force, shall cease all hostile actions within twenty-four hours after the signing of the armistice agreement.

	(2) All armed forces under the control of both sides shall withdraw from the demilitarized zone within seventy-two hours after the signing of the armistice agreement. Except for police armed forces specifically agreed upon by both sides, all armed forces of both sides shall not enter the demilitarized zone thereafter, nor shall they carry out any armed actions in the area. In accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement, both sides shall administer the administrative affairs of their respective sides of the demilitarized zone, which is bounded by the military demarcation line.

	(3) The land, sea, and air armed forces under the control of both sides shall withdraw from the other side's rear areas and coastal islands and sea areas within five days after the signing of the armistice agreement; if they fail to withdraw after the deadline and there are no agreed-upon and valid reasons for extending the withdrawal, the other side shall have the right to take all necessary actions to maintain order for such armed personnel.

	(4) In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice and facilitate the higher-level political conference between the two sides, both sides shall guarantee that no military troops, military personnel, war equipment, and ammunition will enter Korea from outside Korea after the signing of the armistice agreement. However, if either party needs to rotate its military personnel in Korea, it should submit a request to the Military Armistice Commission and obtain approval. The number of such rotations shall not exceed 5,000 people per month and shall be subject to on-site supervision by a neutral nation's inspection agency at the rear ports agreed upon by both sides.

	(5) Both sides shall each appoint an equal number of members to form a Military Armistice Commission, which shall be responsible for supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement and negotiating and handling incidents that violate the armistice agreement. The execution of this supervision and inspection task shall be handled in accordance with the following two provisions:
		A. Within the demilitarized zone, the Military Armistice Commission and its directly dispatched joint teams shall be responsible.
		B. Outside the demilitarized zone, at the rear ports agreed upon by both sides and at the locations where incidents violating the armistice agreement occur, the Military Armistice Commission shall entrust the inspection agency composed of representatives of neutral countries to be responsible.

	(6) Both sides agree to invite neutral countries that have not participated in the Korean War to send an equal number of representatives to form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission after obtaining their consent. This Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission shall accept the entrustment of the Military Armistice Commission and be responsible for dispatching neutral nation inspection teams, via transportation routes agreed upon by both sides, to the rear ports agreed upon by both sides to carry out the supervision tasks stipulated in Article 4, as well as to conduct necessary inspections at the scene of the incident when violations of the armistice agreement occur outside the demilitarized zone, and to submit reports on the results of the supervision and inspection to the Military Armistice Commission. Both sides shall provide full convenience when the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams are performing the above tasks.

    本着合理解决双方分歧点的精神
    我方对第三项议程提出六条方案
    在第四项议程小组委员会上我续斥美方无理态度
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日朝鲜停战谈判的我方代表团本着合理解决双方在第三项议程上分歧点的精神，在第三项议程的小组委员会上提出六条方案（附后），建议小组委员会郑重考虑并接受这一方案作为解决第三项议程的原则协议。在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方坚持以交换战俘资料，并邀请红十字会国际委员会访问俘虏营作为讨论第四项议程的先决条件，而拒绝讨论我方所提出的迅速释放与遣送全体战俘的原则建议的无理态度。我方代表指出我方完全准备交换一切有关战俘的资料，但停战后迅速释放与遣送全部战俘的原则必须首先确定，因为这是第四项议程的最主要的最基本的问题，也是唯一的合理的原则。我方代表继续质问对方：如不确定双方释放全部战俘的原则，有何必要交换全部战俘的名单？即使日内瓦战俘公约也明确规定：敌对行为停止后应立即释放与遣送全体战俘，不得有任何迟延。对方连这一基本原则都不愿遵守，更有何资格援用日内瓦公约以坚持其由国际红十字会访问俘虏营的要求？目前第四项议程的小组委员会的主要任务是确定停战实现后双方立即释放并遣回全部战俘的原则，并以此为根据商定具体步骤，使战俘得以早日回家，享受和平生活。我方代表尖锐质问对方：确定释放全部战俘的原则，并具体安排战俘早日回家的问题重要呢，还是不确定释放全部战俘的原则，而让他们留在俘虏营里被人访问的问题重要呢？我方坚决认为前一个问题毫无疑问是更重要的，应该首先得到讨论。为使第四项议程得以迅速达成协议而不再有所拖延，我方代表指出对方应该对我方的原则建议表示态度，并进行讨论，以奠定解决第四项议程的基础。
    我方的六条方案全文如下：
    （一）双方控制下的一切武装力量，包括陆、海、空军的正规与非正规部队和武装人员，应在停战协议签字后的二十四小时内，停止一切敌对行动。
    （二）双方控制下的一切武装力量，应在停战协议签字后的七十二小时内，自非军事地区撤出。除双方具体协议的警察性的武装力量以外，双方一切武装力量嗣后均不得进入非军事地区，亦不得对该地区进行任何武装行动。按照停战协议的规定，双方各自管理以军事分界线为界的本侧非军事地区的行政事务。
    （三）双方控制下的陆、海、空武装力量，应在停战协议签字后的五天内，自对方的后方和沿海岛屿及海面撤走；如逾期不撤，又无双方同意的和有效的延期撤走的理由，则对方为维持治安，对于此类武装人员有权采取一切必要的行动。
    （四）为保证军事停战的稳定以利双方高一级的政治会议的进行，双方应保证在停战协议签字后不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事部队、军事人员、战争装备和弹药，但双方的任何一方如需要对其在朝鲜的军事人员进行轮换，应向军事停战委员会提出请求，取得批准。此项轮换的人数，每月不得超过五千人，并应经过中立国监察机构的实地监督，在双方同意的后方口岸进行。
    （五）双方各指定同等数目的委员，组成军事停战委员会，负责监督停战协议的实施及协商处理违反停战协议的事件。关于这一监督及视察任务的执行，应照下列两项规定办理：
    甲、在非军事地区以内，由军事停战委员会及其直接派遣的联合小组负责；
    乙、在非军事地区以外的双方同意的后方口岸及发生违反停战协议事件的地点，由军事停战委员会委托中立国代表所组成的监察机构负责。
    （六）双方同意邀请未曾参加朝鲜战争的中立国家，在得其同意后，派出同等数目的代表，成立中立国监察委员会。这一中立国监察委员会接受军事停战委员会的委托，负责派遣中立国视察小组，经由双方协议的交通路线，到双方同意的后方口岸，执行对第四条规定的监察任务，以及当违反停战协议的事件在非军事地区以外发生时，到该肇事地点进行必要的视察，并向军事停战委员会提出有关监督和视察的结果的报告。在中立国视察小组执行上述任务时，双方应予以充分的便利。
