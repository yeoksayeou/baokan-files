    Tianjin Municipal Hospital Cadre Jin Zhixue and Wife
    Embezzle Public Funds and Face Legal Sanctions
    Jin Zhixue and Xu Yihe, cadres of Tianjin Municipal Hospital, have been handed over to the court for punishment for embezzling public funds.
    Jin Zhixue was the head of the cashier section of the hospital. In his work,
    he was consistently perfunctory and irresponsible. Taking advantage of the loopholes in the chaotic accounting system, he engaged in a series of embezzlements. In February 1949, he colluded with Kui Timin of the personnel office and Wang Songnian of the accounting office to embezzle and divide the hospital's original stock of 400 catties of rice. In May of the same year, Jin Zhixue embezzled 40,000 yuan of the hospital's cash reserves (enough to buy 1,800 catties of corn flour at that time). Later, Jin Zhixue, in his capacity as section chief, transferred his wife Xu Yihe from the inpatient department to the cashier section as a cashier without the approval of his superiors, and the two colluded to commit fraud. From then on, the couple often embezzled by not issuing receipts to patients for payments or by altering receipts. For example, citizen Yang Xinsheng paid 80,000 yuan for an "X-ray" fluoroscopy fee, but the receipt only showed 8,000 yuan, and 72,000 yuan was swallowed by the Jin Zhixue couple. In the month of May 1950 alone, they altered receipts as many as 25 times.
    In August 1950, the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau conducted a random inspection of the hospital. In just over a month, it found 487 outpatient prescription slips without receipts and 315 outpatient payment notices without receipts, totaling more than 12.2 million yuan.
    The Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution against the embezzlement of Jin Zhixue and his wife. After trial by the Tianjin Municipal People's Court, Jin Zhixue was sentenced to three years imprisonment and Xu Yihe to one year imprisonment in accordance with the law.

    天津市立医院干部金志学夫妇
    侵吞公款受到法律制裁
    天津市市立医院干部金志学、徐一禾夫妇侵吞公款，已被送交法院惩办。
    金志学是这个医院的出纳股股长。他在工作中，
    一贯敷衍塞责。他乘会计制度混乱的空隙，进行一系列的贪污。一九四九年二月，他和人事室魁体民，会计室王松年等勾结，贪污平分了医院原存的四百斤大米。同年五月间，金志学侵吞医院库存现金四万元（当时可买玉米面一千八百斤）。后来，金志学以股长资格，没有经过上级同意，就私自把他的爱人徐一禾从住院部调到出纳股任收费员，两人串通舞弊。从此，夫妇二人经常用不给病人缴费收据、涂改收据等方式进行贪污。如市民杨新生付“爱克司光”透视费八万元，但是在收据上只开了八千元，被金志学夫妇吞没了七万二千元。在一九五○年五月份内，他们涂改的收据就有二十五次之多。
    一九五○年八月间，天津市卫生局到这个医院抽查，一个多月，就查出门诊处方笺无收据的有四百八十七件，门诊缴费通知单无收据的有三百十五件，合计一千二百二十多万元。
    对金志学夫妇的贪污事件，天津市人民检察署已提出公诉，经天津市人民法院审理，依法判处金志学徒刑三年，徐一禾徒刑一年。		天津市人民检察署
