The Supreme People's Court, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government jointly issued a "Directive on Correcting Several Errors Concerning Marriage Issues" to all levels of People's Governments, judicial organs, and civil affairs departments on the 25th. The full text of the directive is as follows:

Since the implementation of the Marriage Law, women in various localities have launched a resolute struggle against the unreasonable feudal marriage system, which is a good phenomenon. However, some county, district, township, and village cadres have not only failed to actively support the legitimate struggles of women but have instead adopted a bureaucratic attitude, failing to care about the interests of women, and even using "procedures" as an excuse to obstruct or suppress women's struggles. In order to correct several errors that have occurred in the handling of marriage issues by courts, district, township, and village cadres, and marriage registration authorities, this directive is jointly issued.

I. Some courts, upon receiving divorce cases, often refuse to accept them because they lack a letter of introduction from district or village cadres. Some district and village cadres still harbor remnants of feudal ideology, believing that women seeking divorce are indecent and refusing to provide letters of introduction, thus arbitrarily restricting women's right to litigation. This behavior of restricting women's divorce litigation without any legal basis must be thoroughly corrected. The system of letters of introduction should, of course, be abolished for all other lawsuits as well.

II. Some courts consider the format of the complaint (some limit it to ten lines of paper) as a condition for accepting divorce applications filed by women. Under the current circumstances where the general level of education among women has not yet been universally raised, it is already difficult to find someone to write a complaint on their behalf, and it may even cost a lot of money to have a complaint written. If the court refuses to accept it because the complaint does not meet the requirements, this not only violates the general principles of litigation procedure but also seriously restricts women's legitimate demands regarding marriage issues. This unnecessary restriction should be immediately abolished, and oral complaints should be accepted as much as possible, or writing services should be established to solve the difficulties faced by illiterate women in marriage litigation.

III. In some localities, courts dealing with divorce cases push them to the district if they have not undergone district or village mediation, and the district pushes them to the village; sometimes the village pushes them back to the district, and the district pushes them back to the court; there is mutual buck-passing, and the cases cannot be resolved for a long time. Some district and village cadres still have strong remnants of feudal ideology and abuse their power to restrict women's divorce requests. It is incorrect to regard district and village mediation as a necessary procedure before a divorce can be granted, and this must be corrected and prevented.

IV. Some courts, when handling women's divorce cases, believe the reports from district and village cadres without investigation or research, and reject women's legitimate divorce requests without reason. This bureaucratic style of the courts and the lack of attention to women's interests by district and village cadres must be thoroughly corrected.

V. Some district and village cadres adopt an attitude of indifference towards incidents of abuse and killing of women; some do not report them, and some file false reports. Some courts also adopt a similar attitude of indifference towards incidents of abuse and killing of women. These are all serious errors that cannot be tolerated. Cadres of people's courts at all levels must clearly recognize that it is an important task of the courts to protect all legitimate rights and interests of the people, and they should attach importance to incidents that infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of individuals. District and village cadres must also report incidents of abuse and killing of women in a timely manner and must not neglect them.

VI. Some marriage registration authorities charge excessively high fees for marriage certificates, leading many men and women to simply get married without registering, which is very harmful to the implementation of the Marriage Law. In the future, fees must be charged moderately based on the cost of materials (no fees should be charged for divorce certificates) to facilitate the execution of marriage registration. In addition, some registration authorities include the officiant and introducer on the marriage certificate and regard it as a condition for marriage; if there is no officiant or introducer, registration is not allowed, which is inconsistent with the principle of free and voluntary marriage in the Marriage Law. Article 6 of the Marriage Law stipulates that marriage only requires both the man and woman to personally go to the local (district, township) People's Government for registration, and a marriage certificate should be issued if it complies with the provisions of the Marriage Law. As for whether the marriage has an officiant or introducer, it is entirely up to the marrying parties to decide, and the registration authority must not restrict the marriage registration of the marrying parties on this basis.

The above six points are to be strictly checked and earnestly implemented by the People's Governments, judicial, and civil affairs organs at all levels; and the People's Governments of all cities and counties shall inform the district, township, and village-level units to comply accordingly.

### 最高人民法院、司法部、内务部联合发布  关于“纠正几个有关婚姻问题的错误”的指示

    最高人民法院、司法部、内务部联合发布
    关于“纠正几个有关婚姻问题的错误”的指示
    中央人民政府最高人民法院、司法部、内务部在二十五日联合向各级人民政府及司法机关和民政部门发出“纠正几个有关婚姻问题的错误”的指示。指示全文如下：
    自婚姻法施行以来，各地妇女对不合理的封建婚姻制度已经展开了坚决的斗争，这是一个好的现象。但是有些县、区、乡、村干部不但未予妇女的合法斗争以积极的支持，反而以官僚主义的态度，不关心妇女的利益，甚至藉口“手续”，横加阻挠或压制妇女的斗争。兹为纠正法院、区、乡、村干部及婚姻登记机关在处理婚姻问题中所发生的几种错误，特联合发布本指示。
    一、有些法院在收到离婚案件时，往往以没有区、村干部的介绍信而不予受理。而有些区、村干部还存在着封建思想残余，认为要求离婚的妇女不正派，不给介绍信，这样就凭空地限制了妇女的诉讼权利。这种毫无法令依据而限制妇女离婚诉讼的行为，必须彻底加以纠正。其他一切诉讼，当然也同样要取消介绍信的制度。
    二、有些法院对于妇女提出离婚，以起诉书的格式（有的限用十行纸）作为受理与否的条件。在目前一般妇女文化程度尚未普遍提高的情况下，托人代写诉状就已感到困难，甚至花了很多钱，才托人写到一件诉状，法院以诉状不合规定，不予受理，这不仅与一般诉讼程序的原则不合，而且严重地限制了妇女对于婚姻问题的合法要求。这种不必要的限制，应该立即取消，并尽可能地受理口头起诉或设立代书处，解决不识字妇女关于婚姻问题诉讼的困难。
    三、有些地方的法院，对离婚案件，以未经过区、村调解，就推到区里，区又推到村里；有时村又推回区里，区又推到法院；上下推诿，很久不能解决。有些区、村干部还有浓厚的封建思想残余，滥用职权，限制妇女离婚要求。这样把区、村调解看做判决离婚的必经程序，是不对的，必须加以纠正和防止。
    四、有些法院在处理妇女的离婚案件时，对区、村干部的反映，不经调查研究，就信以为真，把妇女正当的离婚要求无故予以驳回。法院这种官僚主义的作风和区、村干部不重视妇女利益的表现，必须彻底加以改正。
    五、有些区、村干部对虐杀妇女的事件抱着熟视无睹的态度，有的不报，有的虚报。而有些法院对虐杀妇女的事件，也同样采取不闻不问的态度。这都是不能容忍的严重错误。各级人民法院工作干部必须明确认识保卫人民的一切合法权益是法院的重要任务，对于侵害个人合法权益的事件，应予重视。区、村干部对虐杀妇女事件，亦必须及时呈报，不得忽视。
    六、有些婚姻登记机关对结婚证收费过高，致使很多男女索性就不登记而结婚，这对贯彻执行婚姻法是非常有害的。今后必须根据工本费酌量收费
    （离婚证不得收费），以利婚姻登记的执行。还有某些登记机关的结婚证上载有主婚人、介绍人，并把它看作结婚的条件，如无主婚人、介绍人，即不准登记，这与婚姻法自主自愿的原则不合。婚姻法第六条规定结婚只须男女双方亲到所在地（区、乡）人民政府登记，凡合于婚姻法的规定者，即应发给结婚证。至结婚有无主婚人、介绍人，则完全由结婚人自行决定，登记机关不得以此限制结婚人的婚姻登记。
    以上六点，希各级人民政府、司法、民政机关均予严格检查，认真执行；并由各市及县人民政府转知区、乡、村级单位遵照。    （新华社）
