    American Captives' Accounts of the "Pusan POW Camp"

    During World War II, we were outraged by the heinous crimes of the Nazi German invaders who slaughtered prisoners of war in concentration camps such as Treblinka and Auschwitz. But today, the American aggressors have restored these hells on earth in Korea, and the American military's "Pusan POW Camp" is one of these living hells.
    In January and February of this year, the American aggressors had a total of five POW camps in Pusan. Later, in order to experiment with bacteriological weapons and to kill our captured personnel with other more violent and barbaric inhuman atrocities, the American warmongers transferred some of our captured personnel to the southern Korean islands. The remaining captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese forces and a large number of innocent Korean people were still imprisoned in the "Pusan POW Camp." According to American captive Private Wunder Caul of the 38th Regiment of the Second Division, "The 'Pusan POW Camp' was surrounded by brick walls ten to fifteen meters high, with electric fences on the walls. The POW camp was surrounded by guard posts, and prisoners were not allowed to pass through at will. The prisoners had no houses to live in and slept on the muddy ground under open-air tents. At that time, the weather was very cold, and the prisoners were wearing thin, tattered clothes and shivering with cold. The prisoners ate coarse food and were often not full. The prisoners were forced to do hard labor all day long, such as loading and unloading goods and building barracks. American soldiers could arbitrarily shoot and beat prisoners. Once I saw an American soldier casually shoot and kill a prisoner."
    American captive Private Schiller said, "Once, I saw many wounded prisoners lying on the muddy ground under a tent. Some of the prisoners had been blinded, and some had had their arms or legs broken. Each of them was seriously injured, and many insects were crawling on their wounds, but they did not receive medical treatment."
    Inside the "Pusan POW Camp," there was a special torture chamber. Captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese forces were often taken to this torture chamber to be subjected to various tortures such as electric shock, flogging, and pouring cold water. Outside the chamber, the sound of flogging and the angry curses of the victims were often heard.
    American captive Corporal Caulmiff of the 8th Cavalry Regiment of the First Cavalry Division said, "Once, I saw an American major and five or six South Korean military police interrogating a Korean People's Army soldier. They forced this People's Army soldier to reveal information about his unit, but this People's Army soldier was very strong and did not say a word. Later, a South Korean soldier pressed an electrified wire against his body. Instantly, the People's Army soldier's face turned pale and he stood stiffly, as if frozen. Later, the military police released the wire, but the People's Army soldier still did not reveal any information about his unit. The South Korean soldiers then beat him mercilessly with wooden sticks, beating him until he was covered in blood and fainted."
    The American butchers also came up with various cruel methods to torture and kill captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese forces. According to American captive Private Schiller, "Once, I saw several South Korean military police, under the command of American officers, force a group of prisoners to strip naked and then lock them in wire cages on cars. The military police then drove the cars quickly, and the prisoners were pricked and torn to pieces by the wire barbs in the wire cages."
    The American invading army is not only a group of barbaric butchers, but also a group of the most shameless bandits. American captive Private Pisap said, "I have seen American and South Korean military officers and soldiers knock out the gold teeth of the prisoners they killed many times and exchange them for money on the black market for their own pleasure."
    The above are just some of the bits and pieces of material confessed by some captured American ordinary soldiers about the atrocities committed by the American military against our captured personnel that they personally witnessed. Although the American murderers have forgotten the just noose of Nuremberg, the towering crimes of the American butchers in slaughtering our captured personnel cannot escape the just sanctions of the people of the world.

### 美俘口中的“釜山战俘营”

    美俘口中的“釜山战俘营”
         新华社记者    王殊
    在第二次世界大战中，我们曾经为纳粹德寇在特烈勃林卡、奥斯威辛等集中营内残杀战俘的令人发指的暴行所震怒。但是在今天，美国侵略者又把这些人间地狱在朝鲜恢复了，美军的“釜山战俘营”就是这些活地狱中的一座。
    今年一、二月间，美国侵略者在釜山共有五个战俘营。后来，美国战争贩子们为了实验细菌武器及用其他更暴戾和更野蛮的非人兽行来残杀我方的被俘人员，又迁移了一部分我方被俘人员到朝鲜南部海岛上去。留下的一部分朝中部队的被俘人员和大批无辜的朝鲜人民，仍被囚禁在“釜山战俘营”内。据美俘第二师第三十八团士兵文德考尔说：“在‘釜山战俘营’四周，都是十公尺到十五公尺高的砖墙，墙上装有电网。俘虏营四周布满了岗哨，不准俘虏随便通行。俘虏们没有房子住，都睡在露天帐篷下的泥地上。那时天气很冷，俘虏们都穿着单薄破烂的衣服，冻得直发抖。俘虏们吃的是粗糙的食物，经常吃不饱。俘虏们整天被迫做着装卸货物、建造营房等苦工。美国士兵可以任意枪杀和打骂俘虏。有一次我就看见一个美国士兵随便地开枪打死了一个俘虏。”
    美俘士兵席勒说：“有一次，我看见很多负伤的俘虏躺在一个帐篷下的泥地上。俘虏中有的眼睛已被打瞎，有的手臂或腿已被打断，他们每个人都负了重伤，很多虫子在他们的伤口上爬，但是，他们得不到医药的治疗。”
    在“釜山战俘营”内，设有专门刑室。朝中部队的被俘人员经常被押到这个刑室里来遭受电刑、鞭挞、灌凉水等种种毒刑，在室外，经常听到鞭挞声和被难者的怒骂声。
    美俘骑兵第一师第八骑兵团士兵考尔密夫说：“有一次我看见一个美国少校和五、六个南朝鲜宪兵，审问一个朝鲜人民军士兵。他们逼迫这个人民军士兵供出自己部队的情况，但是这个人民军士兵很坚强，一个字也不讲。后来，一个南朝鲜士兵就把通电流的电线按在他的身上。顿时这个人民军士兵脸色铁青，直挺挺地站着，像是僵硬了；后来宪兵们放开了电线，但是这个人民军士兵还是不讲自己部队的情况。南朝鲜士兵就用木棍狠命地打他，打得他血流满脸地昏了过去。”
    美国屠夫还想出各种残酷的方法来虐待和杀害朝中部队的被俘人员。据美俘席勒说：“有一次，我看见几个南朝鲜宪兵，在美国军官指挥之下，强迫一群俘虏脱光了衣服，再把俘虏们关在汽车上的铁丝笼里。宪兵们就飞快地开动汽车，汽车颠动着，战俘们在铁丝笼里被铁刺刺得皮开肉烂。”
    美国侵略军不仅是一群野蛮的屠夫，而且也是一群最无耻的盗匪。美俘皮沙普说：“我好几次看到美国和南朝鲜军队的官兵，把被他们杀死的战俘的金牙齿敲下来，到黑市去换成钱，供自己寻欢作乐。”
    以上仅是一些被俘的美军普通士兵所供述的他们亲眼所见的美军虐杀我方被俘人员的点滴材料。虽然，美国杀人犯忘记了纽伦堡的正义的绞索，但是，美国屠夫们残杀我方被俘人员的滔天罪行，是逃不脱世界人民的正义制裁的。
