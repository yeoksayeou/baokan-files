Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in cooperation with relevant departments, formed a Democratic Reform Committee in July this year and dispatched work teams to factories and mines. In an organized and orderly manner, they mobilized the masses to carry out democratic reform in more than 40 public factories and mines in Taiyuan.

The Need for Supplementary Democratic Reform

Since liberation, Taiyuan's public factories and mines have carried out a series of tasks, including arresting special agents, cleaning up and reviewing files, conducting major inspections, registering reactionary party and league members and special agents, reviewing key departments, implementing preliminary quotas, establishing responsibility systems, adjusting wages, and launching production competitions. Mass movements were launched in these tasks. At the same time, democratic reform was implemented, factory management committees and employee representative assemblies were universally established, and the body search system and the "foreman" system in coal and iron mines were abolished. Some unreasonable old organizations and redundant personnel were also adjusted and reduced. Production quickly recovered to pre-war levels. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the masses were further relied upon to report, expose, and arrest a group of counter-revolutionaries hidden and mixed in the enterprises. However, the democratic reforms carried out in the past were generally conducted from top to bottom. Although some problems had been solved, the remnants of bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism were not completely and thoroughly eliminated. Many factories had not seriously mobilized the masses to draw clear lines, and appropriate measures were not taken against some counter-revolutionaries and criminals mixed into the factories. Within the working class, some people had been captured by the reactionary ruling class in the past and had committed mistakes in the ranks of our own class. Some of them have undergone significant changes since liberation, but a few have not yet repented and are actually still suppressing the masses. Old skilled workers were not well mobilized. Among engineers and technicians, many did not care about politics, or even considered themselves "aloof," and had more serious purely technical viewpoints; some leading cadres adopted a liberal attitude towards them and did not actively help them improve and transform themselves politically. Some factory and mine cadres even developed a one-sided view of production and technology, lacked vigilance against feudal reactionaries, and did not reform the old, unreasonable systems. For example, Li Jintang, the head of the maintenance team and transportation team of the sizing workshop of Jinsheng Textile Factory, colluded with counter-revolutionaries to sabotage production and bribe inferior sizing paste, causing the state to lose more than 130 million yuan in one year. Workers made several suggestions for improvement, but the leading cadres of the factory failed to check and never dealt with it. Similar situations also occurred in other factories and mines, affecting the enthusiasm of the workers. In addition, the remnants of sectarian relations and feudal remnants in master-apprentice relations left to the workers by the reactionary ruling class are still quite common. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to boldly mobilize the masses and launch a guided, bottom-up democratic reform movement to eliminate the remnants of bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism.

Overcoming Ideological Obstacles and Fully Mobilizing the Masses

The first key to fully mobilizing the masses is to correct the erroneous understanding of some cadres regarding democratic reform. In the process of carrying out supplementary democratic reform in Taiyuan's public factories and mines, many cadres had varying degrees of resistance. Leading cadres repeatedly conducted education on the general line and general policy within the Party, and repeatedly explained specific policies, educating cadres to understand the nature and tasks of the democratic reform supplementary work from the perspective of the policy line, and gradually overcome various forms of conservative thinking. Some cadres were afraid that carrying out democratic reform would delay production or cause accidents. Facts completely shattered these erroneous ideas; production in various factories and mines not only did not delay after democratic reform, but also improved compared to the past. Some cadres were afraid that the democratic reform movement would harm technicians and staff. Leading cadres promptly pointed out that whether democratic reform would attack technicians and staff depends on whether the policies are correctly grasped and whether the distinction between the enemy and us is clear. At the same time, leading cadres also emphasized mobilizing technicians and staff in the movement. As a result, democratic reform not only did not harm them in the slightest, but also improved their class consciousness. Some cadres were also afraid that democratic reform would disrupt the ranks of workers. The experience of implementing democratic reform in Taiyuan's public factories and mines proves that after fully mobilizing the masses and conducting democratic review and handling, the ranks of the working class were not disrupted, but became stronger and more consolidated; 98% of the masses were involved in the movement; and 96.9% of all employees were approved to enjoy labor insurance.

Mobilizing Old Skilled Workers is a Sign of Fully Mobilizing the Masses

To fully mobilize the masses, it is also necessary to enlighten and educate old skilled workers to become active participants in the movement. Old skilled workers have the longest history in the factories, and they have the deepest experience of how the reactionary classes oppressed and devastated the workers, the greatest class sympathy for the oppressed and devastated working brothers, the greatest hatred for the reactionary elements, and the most affection for the factories where they shed blood, sweat, and toil. Therefore, once old skilled workers are mobilized, they are the most responsible for the factory, the most resolute in fighting the remnants of bureaucratic capitalism, and the most deeply aware of the policy of differentiated treatment. There are two keys to mobilizing old skilled workers: one is whether the leadership regards them as the main force to rely on; the other is whether they dare to let them struggle against those evil elements they hate so much. In the democratic reform movement in Taiyuan's public factories and mines, the mobilization of old skilled workers, like the mobilization of the general masses, went through the following steps and methods: First, through labor insurance card registration, the masses were mobilized to compare and recall, and to draw a clear line between the enemy and us; second, the masses were mobilized to democratically review and handle politically problematic elements. At this time, the leading cadres should express their determination to support the just demands of the masses. After the worker masses received support, their fighting spirit was very high, and they joined the picket team, looked for materials in all aspects, and carried out mass struggles and reasoned accusations. The mobilization of old skilled workers is a sign of fully mobilizing the masses. When old skilled workers are mobilized, it means that the masses have been mobilized to the fullest.

The Class Consciousness of Workers and Technicians is Greatly Enhanced in the Movement

After the masses were fully mobilized, many vivid and moving examples of class struggle emerged. Bai Ruxin, a female worker at the Weaving Factory, exposed the crimes of her own brother; Lou Liangfan accused his father of his crimes. During the reasoned accusations at the Paper Mill, 80% of the people spoke; at the Cement Plant, 92% spoke. In the past, when reactionary elements spread rumors, the workers did not pay attention, saying, "That's just talking nonsense, that person has a bad mouth." Now they realize that those were rumors from the reactionaries, not a matter of "bad mouth." The 1,500-member worker picket team at the Steel Plant played a huge role; being a member of the picket team became a glorious title among the masses. A fugitive who ran from Baoding entered the Xishan Coal Mine; when the workers saw that he had handcuff marks, they immediately reported him and sent him to the government. The workers were highly vigilant against those under surveillance, believing that they could not let their guard down. In the past, under the oppression of feudal reactionary elements, the workers' thoughts were reflected in the following: "A thousand years of hatred pressed in the bottom of my heart, the world changes and people are red in three dynasties (referring to feudal reactionary elements being red during the Japanese puppet regime, red during Yan Xishan's rule, and still red after liberation)," "When the Communist Party came, the people (referring to the feudal reactionary elements) had a layer of red skin on the white radish"; after carrying out supplementary democratic reform, the workers were very excited and said: "The stone slab on our heads has been removed, and from now on, we will be the masters of our own house!" Workers at the People's Shoe Factory said: "In the past, we only cared about reaching out for millet, opening our mouths for millet; we didn't care about the quality of the products, as long as we got the millet. Now we know that only when production develops and the factory is run well can the workers have a way out." In the past, when the whistle blew, some workers would drop their tools and go home; now they have turned into "watching the work before clocking out." Some workers said: "Since the Communist Party came, how come the days have become shorter!" Workers at the No. 2 Power Plant voluntarily handed over washing machine tubes. Many workers asked to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

Through this mass movement, the erroneous ideological viewpoints of many engineering and technical personnel were fundamentally transformed, creating excellent conditions for more detailed ideological transformation in the future. The democratic reform of Taiyuan's public factories and mines proves that it is necessary to resolutely strike at counter-revolutionaries who have committed heinous crimes and to conduct appropriate struggles against politically dissident elements in order to appease popular anger and give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of engineering and technical personnel. After launching struggles against those criminal elements, many engineering and technical personnel reflected: "Good and bad people are distinguished." "The big feudal stone has been moved away, we have raised our heads, and we have more energy for production work." In the struggle against some criminal elements, all engineering and technical personnel must be mobilized to participate in this movement; and they must be given class education to oppose the supra-class views and the idea of technology being separated from politics of some people. The existence of this idea has always hindered their progress; in their work, it is manifested as a perfunctory attitude or a lack of courage to take responsibility. Some senior staff members, after this mass movement, realized: "In the past, I thought there was no class struggle, but now I know that there is indeed class struggle in the world, the question is which side we are on." Many staff members and technicians felt that the workers were progressing quickly politically, and that they were lagging behind. Therefore, the saying that "politics cannot replace millet" has changed greatly, and many people feel that they must change their minds and strive to study Marxism-Leninism. The broad masses of engineering and technical personnel have deep hatred for the reactionary elements who oppressed them in the past. After this movement, the distinction between the enemy and us became clear, and their class consciousness improved relatively quickly. A few people who had been stained in history also put down their burdens and improved their work enthusiasm after self-criticism. Many people felt: "Democratic reform saved us."

Strengthening Internal Unity Through Criticism and Self-Criticism

After fully mobilizing the workers, we should "strike while the iron is hot" and solve the problem of internal unity. The important point in resolving the internal problems of the workers is that the leading cadres should first make self-criticisms (as the People's Shoe Factory, Weaving Factory, and Waterworks did); the other is to encourage employees who have made mistakes to make self-criticisms. For example, when the Repair and Maintenance Department of Jinsheng Textile Factory solved the sectarian small group of the third shift workers, everyone reviewed that the reason for these disunities was that the reactionary ruling class created internal divisions among the workers in order to rule and oppress them. They said: "In the future, we should no longer divide by region or small group, but distinguish each other from the perspective of class and revolutionary interests." Six workers at the People's Shoe Factory who had beaten and scolded workers in the past took the initiative to apologize to everyone this time. The workers said: "This is a matter within our own brothers, as long as they admit their mistakes and correct them, that's enough." Some staff members and technicians realized that they had been deceived in the past, and that loyalty to the reactionary ruling class was harmful to the people, so their attitude changed and they became closer to the workers. In short, class consciousness has been improved, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism has been unfolded, and all feudal and backward personnel relations have gradually been replaced by new relations of democratic unity. The whole process of mobilizing the masses is a mass self-education movement, a vivid and practical lesson in Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

The Achievements of Democratic Reform are Concentrated in the Leap Forward in Production

After the implementation of democratic reform in Taiyuan's public factories and mines, a completely different scene appeared in production. The steelmaking department of the Steel Plant overfulfilled its task by 22.604% in August and completed 114% of its plan in September. After the downfall of the foreman Zhao Zhongshan in the wire rod department of the Taiyuan Machine Factory, production exceeded the quota by 88.88% in August. Employees of various factories actively put forward rationalization proposals and improved technology and operating methods. The Taiyuan Machine Factory gave full play to the collective wisdom of workers and technicians and successfully created a 65-horsepower coal cutter. The original daily output of the 200-horsepower single-hook hoisting machine in the Xishan Coal Mine was at most 800 tons; after adopting the workers' suggestion to change it to a double-hook hoisting machine, the efficiency increased by nearly one time. The No. 2 Power Plant combined a 15-kilogram pressure and a 17-kilogram pressure into one ventilation pipe, so that the pressure was no longer high and low, ensuring the effectiveness of continuous load, saving No. 5 spare pressure, saving three tons of coal per day, and reducing coal consumption to 1.1427 kilograms.

After democratic reform, the consciousness of the employees was improved, and they consciously improved and consolidated the attendance system. The bad tendencies of being late, leaving early, and being lazy were greatly reduced. The attendance rate of various factories and mines has generally increased. The attendance rate of Xishan Coal Mine increased from 74% in April to 83% in August; the attendance rate of the riveters in the Taiyuan Machine Factory reached 99% in September, and the attendance rate of the entire factory reached 98% in August. The attendance rate of the No. 2 Power Plant also reached 99% in September. Because the sectarian concepts within the working class were overcome, it facilitated the establishment and consolidation of the shift handover system. In the past, the three shifts of the steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Machine Factory were not united; after the downfall of the foreman Qin Yiren (feudal foreman), the relationship between the three shifts became close, and the shift handover system was improved. The No. 2 Power Plant also implemented a three-shift handover system: the people on the shift arrived ten minutes early, went to the workshop to understand the situation first, and wrote down any shortcomings of the people on the outgoing shift in the opinion book; the people on the outgoing shift also wrote down their opinions on the work they handed over in the opinion book; the two sides cooperated closely. Through the democratic reform movement, safety committees and workshop safety groups were generally established in Taiyuan's public factories and mines, and began to play a role.

The management system of various factories and mines has also been improved in the democratic reform. Many factories and mines have overcome the phenomena of inaccurate accounting, backlog of statements and reports, untimely transfers, incomplete procedures, delays in not being trustworthy, and irresponsibility. For example, the accounting department of the Taiyuan Machine Factory accumulated three months of statements, reports, and documents, which greatly hindered cost accounting. In the democratic reform, the political awareness of the accounting staff was unprecedentedly improved, a sense of political responsibility was established, the work accumulated for three months was completed, and all procedures for September were completed on time. The Flour Company inventoried the warehouse and sold the backlog of equipment and materials at a price, accelerating the turnover of funds.

Through this movement, various factories and mines promoted some activists among the workers and staff to take on leadership responsibilities, replenishing the leadership structure of the factory with new blood; therefore, it is also changing the old habits and gradually cultivating a new leadership style. A worker in the Tobacco Company has a lot of technical experience and was promoted to acting production management section chief this time; with the active support and support of the worker masses, coupled with his own efforts, he led the production very well. They also promoted 18 people from workers, work police, workmen, and trainees to be cadres, and formulated a plan to train cadres in the second half of the year. In the democratic reform of 41 units, a group of cadres were promoted from the group to the workshop, section, and department. This has consolidated the leadership of the factory and strengthened the relationship between the leadership and the masses.

    太原市公营厂矿补行民主改革把旧企业彻底改造成人民企业
    韩纯德
    中共太原市委员会在今年七月协同有关部门组成民主改革委员会，并派遣工作组深入厂矿，在太原市四十多个公营厂矿有计划有秩序地发动群众补行了民主改革。
    补行民主改革是十分必要的
    解放以来，太原市公营工厂矿山，曾经进行了逮捕特务、清理审查、大检查、登记反动党团会门特务、审查要害部门、实行初步定额、建立责任制度、调整工资、开展生产竞赛等一系列的工作，并在这些工作中开展了群众运动。在运动中，同时贯彻了民主改革，普遍地建立了工厂管理委员会、职工代表会，废除了抄身制及煤矿铁矿中的把头制。对某些不合理的旧机构和冗员，也进行了调整和裁汰。生产迅速恢复到战前水平。在镇压反革命运动中，更进一步依靠群众检举、揭发、逮捕了隐藏和混入企业中的一批反革命分子。但是，过去所进行的民主改革，一般是自上而下进行的；虽然已经解决了若干问题，但没有全面地彻底地清除官僚资本主义和封建主义的残余势力。许多工厂还没有认真地发动群众划清界限，对于混入工厂的一些反革命分子和过去有罪恶的分子分别加以适当处理。在工人阶级内部，有些人过去曾作了反动统治阶级的俘虏，曾经在本阶级队伍中犯了过失。其中有些人在解放以后已经有显著的转变，但有少数人仍然没有表示悔改，实际上仍然压制着群众。老的技术工人没有很好地发动起来。在工程师和技术人员中，许多人不问政治，甚至自鸣“清高”，有比较严重的单纯技术观点；某些领导干部，对于他们采取了自由主义的态度，没有积极地从政治上帮助他们提高和改造。某些厂矿干部甚至还滋长了一种片面的生产观点和技术观点，对封建反动分子缺乏警惕性，对旧的不合理制度也不进行改革。如晋生纺织厂浆纱间保全组长兼运输组长李金堂，勾结反革命分子破坏生产，贿买劣品浆纱膏，一年多使国家损失一亿三千多万元。工人因此几次提出改进的建议，但该厂领导干部失于检查，始终未作处理。类似情况也在其他厂矿发生，影响了工人们生产积极性的发挥。此外，反动统治阶级遗留给工人内部的宗派关系和师徒关系上的封建残余，也还相当普遍地存在着。因此，放手发动群众，开展一次有领导的自下而上的民主改革运动，肃清官僚资本主义和封建主义的残余势力，是十分必要的。
    克服思想障碍，充分发动群众
    充分发动群众的第一个关键，是纠正某些干部对民主改革的错误认识。太原市公营厂矿在补行民主改革的过程中，许多干部曾经有程度不等的抗拒心理。领导干部在党内反复进行了总路线总政策的教育，反复交代了具体政策，教育干部从政策路线上理解民主改革补课工作的性质和任务，逐步克服了各种形式的保守思想。有些干部曾经害怕进行民主改革会耽误生产或者出事故。事实完全打破了这些错误的想法；各厂矿的生产经过民主改革不但没有耽误，而且比过去提高了。有些干部怕在民主改革运动中伤害技术人员和职员。领导干部及时指出：民主改革是不是会打击技术人员与职员，问题在于掌握政策是否正确，敌我界限是否清楚。同时，在运动中，领导干部也强调了发动技术人员和职员。结果，民主改革不但丝毫不曾伤害他们，而且把他们的阶级觉悟提高了。还有一些干部怕民主改革搞乱了工人队伍。太原市公营厂矿实行民主改革的经验证明，充分发动了群众，进行了民主审查处理之后，工人阶级队伍不但没有搞乱，而且变得更加坚强和巩固了；群众卷入运动的有百分之九十八；被通过享受劳动保险的职工，占全体职工的百分之九十六点九。
    老技术工人的发动是充分发动群众的标志
    要充分发动群众，还必须启发和教育老技术工人成为运动中的积极分子。老技术工人在工厂中是历史最久的，他们对反动阶级如何压迫摧残工人体验得最深刻，对工人弟兄受压迫摧残具有最大的阶级同情心；他们对反动分子有最大的仇恨，对自己在那里流血流汗辛勤劳动的工厂最有感情。因之，老技术工人一旦发动起来，他们对工厂最负责，对官僚资本主义残余势力斗争最坚决，对分别对待的政策体会得也深刻。发动老技术工人的关键有两点：一个关键是领导上是否把他们作为主要的依靠力量；另一个关键是敢不敢让他们斗争那些他们十分痛恨的罪恶分子。太原市公营厂矿在民主改革运动中，对老技术工人的发动和一般群众的发动一样是经过下列这些步骤和方法的：第一步，通过劳动保险卡片登记，发动群众对比回忆，划清敌我界限；第二步，发动群众民主审查处理政治上有问题的分子。这时，领导干部应表明决心，支持群众的正义要求。工人群众得到支持以后，斗争情绪十分高涨，参加纠察队，到各方面找材料，纷纷进行大会斗争和说理控诉。老技术工人的发动，是充分发动群众的标志。老技术工人发动起来了，也就是群众发动到了最饱满的时候。工人和技术人员的阶级觉悟在运动中大大提高
    在群众充分发动之后，出现了不少生动的可歌可泣的阶级斗争的范例。织造厂女工白如信揭发了她的胞兄的罪行；娄良范控诉了他的父亲的罪行。造纸厂说理控诉时，发言的有百分之八十；洋灰厂有百分之九十二。过去反动分子造谣，工人不注意，说“那是说二话哩，那人嘴不好”。现在觉悟到那是反动派的谣言，不是“嘴不好”的问题。钢铁厂
    一千五百人的工人纠察队起了极大作用；纠察队在群众中成为一种光荣的称号。从保定跑来一个逃犯，进了西山煤矿；工人见他有手铐印子，立即检举了他，把他送到政府。工人对被管制分子警惕很高，认为不能松气。过去，在封建反动分子的压迫下，工人们的思想反映是：“千年仇恨心底压，世变人在三朝红（指封建反动分子在日伪统治时期红，在阎匪锡山统治时期红，在解放后仍然红）”，
    “共产党来了，人家（指封建反动分子）白萝卜上长了一层红皮”；补行民主改革后，工人们都很兴奋地说：“把顶在头上的石板揭掉了，以后就是如何当家作主啦！”人民鞋厂工人说：“过去只管伸手要小米，张口要小米；不管产品质量好坏，弄到小米就算。现在才知道：生产发展了，工厂搞好了，工人才有办法。”过去一拉汽笛，有些工人扔下工具就回家，现在变成了“看活下工”。有的工人说：“共产党来了，怎么天变得短了！”发电二厂工人自动交出洗器管机。许多工人要求加入共产党和青年团。
    经过这次群众运动，许多工程技术人员的错误思想观点获得一次根本性的改造，给今后更细致的思想改造创造了极好的条件。太原市公营厂矿的民主改革证明：必须对罪大恶极的反革命分子给以坚决打击，对政治上的异己分子进行适当斗争，才足以平民愤，才能够发挥广大工程技术人员的积极性。经过对那些罪恶分子开展了斗争以后，许多工程技术人员反映：“好坏人分清了。”“搬掉封建大石头，我们抬了头，生产工作有劲头。”在对一些罪恶分子进行斗争中，必须发动所有工程技术人员参加这个运动；并对他们进行阶级教育，反对某些人的超阶级观点和技术脱离政治的思想。这种思想的存在，一直障碍着他们的进步；表现在工作上则是应付态度或不敢大胆负责。某些高级职员经过这次群众性的运动，认识到：“过去我认为没有阶级斗争，现在才知道了世界上确有阶级斗争，问题是我们站在那方面。”许多职员和技术人员感到工人在政治上进步快，自己是落后了一些。因而“政治顶不了小米”的说法大为改变，许多人感到必须换换脑筋，努力学习马克思列宁主义。广大工程技术人员，对过去欺压过他们的反动分子，有极深的仇恨。经过这次运动，敌我界限分明了，因而阶级觉悟提高较快。少数历史上曾染有污点的人，经过自我批评以后，也放下了包袱，提高了工作积极性。许多人感到：“民主改革挽救了我们。”
        用批评和自我批评的方法
    加强内部团结
    充分发动了工人之后，就应当“趁热打铁”，解决内部团结问题。工人内部问题的解决，重要的一条是领导干部首先作自我检讨（如人民鞋厂、织造厂、自来水厂等都是这样做的）；另外是启发有过错的职工作自我检讨。如晋生纺织厂修保部解决三班工人的宗派小集团时，大家检讨出这些不团结的原因是反动统治阶级为了统治压榨工人所造成的工人内部分裂。他们说：“今后不应该再分地区、小集团，要从阶级上革命利益上分清彼此。”人民鞋厂有六个工人过去打骂过工人，这次主动向大家道了歉。工人说：“这是自己弟兄内部的事，只要认错改正也就算了。”某些职员、技术人员认识到过去受了骗，知道了对反动统治阶级的忠实正是对人民的危害，因而态度变了，和工人接近了。总之，阶级觉悟提高了，批评与自我批评的空气展开了，一切封建的落后的人事关系逐渐被民主的团结的新关系所代替了。发动群众的整个过程，是一个群众性的自我教育运动，是一课生动的实际的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的教育。
    民主改革的成果集中表现在生产上的跃进
    太原市公营厂矿实行民主改革后，生产上出现了完全不同的景象。钢铁厂炼钢部八月份超额完成任务百分之二十二点六○四，九月份完成计划百分之一百一十四。太原机器厂线材部门倒把头赵忠山后，八月份生产超额达百分之八十八点八八强。各厂职工积极提出合理化建议，改进了技术和操作方法。太原机器厂发挥了工人和技术人员的集体智慧，创制六十五马力截煤机成功。西山煤矿二百马力单钩提升机原来每天产量最高八百吨；采纳工人建议改为双钩提升机后，效率提高将近一倍。发电二厂把一座十五公斤气压和一座十七公斤气压并进一个通气管子，使气压不再忽高忽低，保证了持续负荷的效能，节省了五号备用气压，每天省煤三吨，使煤耗降低到一点一四二七公斤。
    民主改革后，职工觉悟提高，自觉地健全和巩固了考勤制度。迟到早退和偷懒的不良倾向大大减少。各厂矿出勤率普遍提高。西山煤矿出勤率由四月份百分之七十四上升到八月份的百分之八十三；太原机器厂铆工部九月份出勤率达到百分之九十九，全厂八月份的出勤率达到百分之九十八。发电二厂九月份出勤率也达到百分之九十九。由于克服了工人阶级内部的宗派观念，就便利了交接班制度的建立和巩固。太原机器厂炼钢部，过去三班互相不团结；把工长覃乙人（封建把头）斗倒后，三个班的关系密切了，健全了交接班制。发电二厂也实行了三班交接制：上班的人早到十分钟，先到车间了解情况，看到下班的人有什么不周到之处，写在意见簿上；下班时把自己工作交代的意见也写在意见簿上；双方密切配合。经过民主改革运动，太原市公营厂矿普遍建立了安全委员会和车间安全小组，并开始发挥作用。
    各厂矿的经营管理制度在民主改革中也有改进。许多厂矿克服了过去会计计算不准确、积压表报不按时转账、手续不周密、拖延不讲信用以及不负责任的现象。如太原机器厂会计科积压下三个月的表报、单据，大大地阻碍了成本计算。在民主改革中，会计工作人员政治觉悟空前提高，树立了政治责任心，把三个月积压的工作做完，并且使九月份的一切手续按时完成。面粉公司清点了仓库，把积压的器具、器材作价售卖，加速了资金周转。
    经过这次运动，各厂矿都提拔了一些工人、职员中的积极分子担负领导责任，使工厂的领导机构补充了新的血液；因而，也改变着旧的习气，逐步培植起新的领导作风。烟草公司一个工人很有技术经验，这次被提升为代理生产管理科长；在工人群众的积极支持和拥护下，加上自己的努力，把生产领导得很好。他们并从工人、工警、工务员、练习生中提拔了十八个人做干部，并订出了后半年培养干部的计划。四十一个单位在民主改革中，从小组到车间、科、部，都提拔了一批干部。这样便巩固了厂的领导，密切了领导方面和群众的关系。
