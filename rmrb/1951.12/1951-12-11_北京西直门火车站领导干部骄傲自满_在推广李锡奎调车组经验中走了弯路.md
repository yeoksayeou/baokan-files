    Leading Cadres of Beijing Xizhimen Railway Station Are Complacent and Arrogant
    Taking a Detour in Promoting Li Xikui's Shunting Team Experience
    When the Beijing Xizhimen Railway Station began to promote the advanced working experience of Li Xikui's shunting team, it took a detour due to the serious complacency of the administrative leading cadres. They did not consult with the Party branch, the trade union, or the Communist Youth League branch beforehand, and announced that they would study the advanced working experience of the Li Xikui shunting team from November 1st to 15th, and fully promote it from the 16th. They did not report to the Party branch committee afterwards. Although they stipulated a study time, they did not mobilize the workers ideologically and did not organize the workers to study well, so when the study phase was about to end, many workers were still "at a loss" and could not promote it.
    The reason why the promotion work at Xizhimen Railway Station took a detour was that they believed that their work had a foundation, that the cadres were strong, and that the workers were highly aware, so there was no need to do ideological mobilization, and there was no need for key experiments. In fact, their view is unfounded. For example, they did not complete the transportation task this year: the transfer time of transit vehicles at the station exceeded the prescribed 0.3 hours; the stop time of stopping vehicles exceeded 0.6 hours. If calculated at 500 vehicles per day (actually more than this number), more than 10,000 catties of millet would be wasted every day. How can this be called "work with a foundation"? After nearly half a month of promotion, the workers still haven't been mobilized. How can this be called "workers with high awareness"? This is just blind complacency.
    Why does this blind complacency arise? Because Xizhimen Railway Station learned the new shunting method from the Northeast last year, the work was once very good, and it won the title of "Model Station" from the Tianjin Railway Administration. The administrative leading cadres have developed a serious sense of complacency since then. In August this year, when the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government instructed to promote the advanced working experience of the Li Xikui shunting team, they believed that "Li Xikui's shunting method is nothing" and did not promote it. In October, after the Tianjin Railway Administration criticized them, they realized the importance of promoting the advanced working experience of the Li Xikui shunting team.
    With the help of the Party and the trade union, their mistakes have been corrected. On November 14th, a general meeting of Party members and Youth League members was held to revise the promotion plan. From November 15th, the Zhang Liande shunting team was taken as the focus, and the promotion was tested. After more than 20 days of testing, the work of the shunters has changed from passive to active. However, because the work of the entire station lacks planning (there is no daily work plan), the shunting work still often has the phenomenon of "returning the train" halfway. In order to do a good job in promotion in the future, in addition to completely overcoming the complacency of the administrative leading cadres, it is also necessary to strengthen the planning of the work.

    北京西直门火车站领导干部骄傲自满
    在推广李锡奎调车组经验中走了弯路
    北京西直门火车站开始推广李锡奎调车组先进工作经验时，因为行政领导干部有严重的自满情绪，走了弯路。他们事先没有和党支部、工会、青年团支部商量，就宣布十一月一日到十五日学习李锡奎调车组先进工作经验，十六日起全面推广。事后也没有报告党支部委员会。他们虽然规定了一个学习时间，但因为没有把工人从思想上发动起来，没有很好地组织工人学习，所以学习阶段快完结了的时候，许多工人仍然“摸不着底”，推广不起来。
    西直门火车站的推广工作所以走弯路，是因为他们认为自己的工作有基础，干部硬，工人觉悟高，所以用不着做思想动员，用不着重点试验。实际上，他们这种看法是没有根据的。譬如，他们今年没有完成运转任务：中转车在车站停车时间超过规定零点三小时；停站车超过零点六小时。如果每天以五百辆车计算（实际上并不止这个数目），每天就浪费小米一万斤以上。这怎能叫做“工作有基础”呢？推广了将近半个月，工人仍然没有发动起来。这怎样叫做“工人觉悟高”呢？这只是盲目的骄傲自满。
    为什么产生这种盲目的自满情绪呢？因为西直门火车站去年学习了东北的新调车法，工作一度很好，获得天津铁路管理局“模范站”的称号。行政领导干部从那时起便产生了严重的骄傲自满情绪。今年八月，中央人民政府铁道部指示推广李锡奎调车组先进工作经验时，他们认为“李锡奎调车法没有什么”，没有推广。十月，天津铁路管理局提出批评以后，他们才认识了推广李锡奎调车组先进工作经验的重要。
    在党和工会的帮助下，他们的错误已经纠正。十一月十四日召开了党、团员大会，修正了推广计划。从十一月十五日起，以张连德调车组为重点，试验推广。试验了二十多天，调车员的工作已经由被动转为主动。但是，因为整个车站工作缺乏计划性（没有每日工作计划），调车工作仍常常发生中途“返车”现象。今后要做好推广工作，除了彻底克服行政领导干部的自满情绪外，还得加强工作的计划性。（超祺）
