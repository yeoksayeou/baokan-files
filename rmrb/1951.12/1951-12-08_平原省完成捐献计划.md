    Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang, 7th. The people of Pingyuan Province have exceeded their donation plan. As of December 5th, the province's actual donations reached more than 48.6 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan to donate 30 fighter planes by 8 percent. With this, all five provinces in North China have completed their weapon donation plans.
    Under the slogan "Sweat more in the rear, bleed less at the front," the people of Pingyuan Province enthusiastically threw themselves into the donation movement. Although some areas of the province suffered disasters this year, due to the high patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, many disaster areas still completed their donations during production and self-rescue. For example, the Huxi Special District of the province suffered a relatively severe disaster, but it still overfulfilled its donation task of 3.687 billion yuan.

    平原省完成捐献计划
    【新华社新乡七日电】平原省人民已超额完成捐献计划。截至十二月五日，该省实缴献款已达四百八十六亿多元，超过原订认捐三十架战斗机计划的百分之八。至此，华北五省全部完成了捐献武器的计划。
    平原省广大人民在“后方多流一滴汗，前方少流一滴血”口号下，踊跃投入了捐献运动。该省今年虽有部分地区遭灾，但由于群众爱国热情高涨，不少灾区在生产自救中仍然完成了捐献。如该省湖西专区受灾较重，但也超计划完成到三十六亿八千七百多万元的捐献任务。
