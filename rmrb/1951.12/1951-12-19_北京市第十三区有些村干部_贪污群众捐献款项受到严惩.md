To the Editor:

    In late October, we specially assigned a group of cadres to conduct in-depth investigations in rural areas regarding the payment of donations. We discovered that some leading cadres in individual villages had embezzled and misappropriated donations from the masses. Hou Zhenhe, a public security officer and militia platoon leader in Diaoyutai Village, embezzled more than 5 million yuan in donations from the masses, of which more than 3 million yuan were the fruits of the farmers' labor in digging rivers. At a village cadre meeting in Diaoyutai Village, someone asked him if he had any deposits that had not been handed over to the bank. He said, "There is only overpayment, how could there be underpayment!" But now the facts prove that he underpaid. Zhao Mingxian, a village people's representative, militia platoon leader, and head of the people's school in Diaoyutai Village, also embezzled and misappropriated 380,000 yuan in donations from the masses. Huang Degui, a people's representative and militia company commander in Luodaozhuang Village, used more than 1 million yuan in donations from the masses to add equipment to the people's school, and embezzled 250,000 yuan from it. In addition, Zhang Dequan, a village government committee member, militia squad leader, and member of the village Communist Youth League branch in Laoyingfang Village, embezzled more than 600,000 yuan in donations paid by farmers.

    The above facts were exposed by the masses and discussed at village people's representative meetings. With the approval of the leading authorities, in addition to recovering the embezzled donations in full and giving them dismissal punishments, Hou Zhenhe and Zhao Mingxian were handed over to the People's Court for legal action. Huang Degui, with the approval of the Luodaozhuang Party branch and the Thirteenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was given a punishment of probation within the Party. Zhang Dequan has been expelled from the Communist Youth League.

    北京市第十三区有些村干部
    贪污群众捐献款项受到严惩
    编辑同志：十月下旬，我们专门调配了一部分干部，深入农村调查各地缴纳献款的情况，发现个别村的领导干部有贪污和挪用群众献款的现象。钓鱼台村公安员、自卫队分队长侯振和，私吞群众献款五十多万元，其中三十多万元都是农民挖河的劳动果实。在钓鱼台村一次村干部会议上，有人问他是否还有存款未缴银行，他说：“只有多缴，那有少缴！”但现在事实证明他是少缴了。钓鱼台村村人民代表、自卫队分队长、民校负责人赵明贤，也贪污和挪用群众献款三十八万元。罗道庄村人民代表、自卫队中队长黄德贵，先后把群众献款一百多万元用来添设民校校具，并从中贪污了二十五万元。另外，老营房村村政府委员、民兵班长、村青年团支部委员张德全，先后贪污农民缴纳的献款六十多万元。
    上述事实经群众检举，村人民代表会议讨论，领导机关批准，除如数追回贪污献款并给以撤职处分外，侯振和、赵明贤送交人民法院依法处理；黄德贵经罗道庄党支部通过，中共十三区区委会批准，予以留党察看的处分；张德全已被开除团籍。
