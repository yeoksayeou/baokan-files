(Beijing News Agency) To implement the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various units in Beijing have been making preparations, drafting specific plans, and launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to combat corruption and waste for the past month.

On the 1st of this month, the Beijing Municipal Third People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee held an expanded joint meeting. The main topic was how to launch an anti-corruption campaign throughout the city.

At the meeting, Chairman Peng Zhen first explained the importance of launching the anti-corruption campaign. He pointed out that the People's Government is a clean government, but the corruption of a few staff members is still serious. Since the liberation of Beijing, the city's units have conducted two major inspections and rectification study movements, and have discovered and dealt with a total of 650 corrupt elements. The number of those who have not yet been discovered will be higher than this. In order to further eliminate corruption and establish a solid clean atmosphere, leading comrades of all units must take effective measures to conduct systematic and in-depth inspections, and mobilize the masses from the bottom up to carry out mass reporting, vigorously launching an anti-corruption campaign throughout the city.

The members of the Municipal Consultative Committee, the Municipal People's Government Committee, and the responsible cadres of various units who attended the meeting listened to Chairman Peng Zhen's speech and successively expressed their opinions, unanimously supporting the launch of the anti-corruption campaign. Zheng Yun, a member of the Municipal People's Government Committee, said, "Now that we are launching an anti-corruption campaign, the people will trust their government even more." Shu Sheyu, a member of the Municipal Consultative Committee, believed that to eliminate corruption, one is that the system must be strict, and the other is that some people have heavy family burdens and should be taken care of. Fu Huating said, "Our industrial and commercial circles will definitely enthusiastically participate in this movement. There is still a phenomenon of bribery and enticement of staff by our industrial and commercial circles. We believe that Mayor Peng's pointing out that bribers and bribe-takers should be punished equally is very correct. Our Federation of Industry and Commerce is willing to educate ourselves and overcome this bad phenomenon." Lei Jieqiong, Chen Mingde, Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Duansheng, Zhu Changjiang and others all advocated launching the anti-corruption struggle vigorously. Liang Sicheng expressed his warm support for launching the anti-corruption campaign. He said, "Doing so will not only not damage the prestige of the People's Government and the Communist Party, but will precisely further enhance the prestige of the government and the Party." Zhang Xiruo pointed out that corruption is a bad phenomenon left over from the old society, and the People's Government cannot tolerate its existence. He said, "There are two guarantees that the People's Government will not be corrupt or engage in corruption: pre-education and strict handling afterwards." Chen Yuan proposed four methods to make corrupt people dare not be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, do not have to be corrupt, and do not need to be corrupt. He said, "Strict handling makes them dare not; the system makes them unable; education prevents them from being corrupt; and some people have heavy family burdens and difficult lives, and appropriately adjusting their treatment can make them not need to be corrupt."

In order to oppose corruption and waste, the units under the Municipal People's Government have recently made some preparations. In their speeches, the heads of various departments all believed that it is very necessary to launch the anti-corruption campaign at present, and they promised to do this work conscientiously and responsibly. Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, said, "This movement is particularly needed in the financial and economic departments. The responsible cadres of the financial and economic departments must recognize the political significance of this anti-corruption movement, effectively lead the movement, mobilize the masses to report and strictly inspect within the organs, and eliminate all corrupt elements." Wang Chun, Director of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, reported on the preliminary inspection of the cooperative system recently. He said, "The corruption phenomenon in the cooperatives is very serious. According to the recent inspection materials, among the 132 staff members of the Ninth District Union Cooperative, 39 corrupt elements of all sizes were found, and among the 150 staff members of the Sixth District Cooperative, 34 were corrupt. This is due to our lack of education and lack of inspection. It is hoped that in this anti-corruption campaign, we can get the reporting and supervision of the masses to help us transform the staff of the cooperatives and truly establish the work style of serving the people." Jia Xingwu, President of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, and Zhang Jincheng, Deputy Director of the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, both said that in addition to internally mobilizing staff to confess and report, they also hope that the broad masses of people will assist and report corruption. Feng Jiping, Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, said, "We welcome the broad masses of citizens to report the corruption of public security personnel without any concerns." Wang Feiran, President of the Municipal People's Court, analyzed the 153 corruption cases handled by the court, and found that only one case was due to the misappropriation of public funds due to financial difficulties, and the others were due to corrupt lifestyles, being seduced, and colluding with bad elements in industry and commerce to engage in corruption.

Finally, Chairman Peng Zhen summarized everyone's opinions and made a concluding speech. He said: Today we have initially exchanged views on the issue of anti-corruption, and everyone has put forward many good suggestions. In a few days, our Municipal Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee will hold another joint meeting to formulate a specific plan for launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy and combat corruption and waste, and the Municipal People's Representative Conference will make overall arrangements. We believe that through this vigorous anti-corruption struggle, a fatal blow will be dealt to corrupt elements, the clean work style of the People's Government will be more fully established, and the bad habits remaining in society will be further transformed.

    北京市协商委员会和市人民政府委员会举行联席会议
    讨论开展全市规模反贪污运动
    彭真同志号召发动群众大张旗鼓铲除贪污现象
    【北京市新闻处讯】北京市属各单位，为了贯彻执行人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的决议，一个月来，正分别进行准备工作，拟订具体计划，展开一个增产节约和反贪污浪费的运动。
    本月一日，北京市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会和市人民政府委员会举行扩大联席会议，主要议题是讨论如何在全市展开反贪污运动的问题。
    会议首先由彭真主席说明开展反贪污运动的重要意义。他指出：人民政府是廉洁的政府，可是少数工作人员的贪污现象仍然是严重的。从北京解放到现在，市属各单位经过两次大检查和整风学习运动，已经发现和处理的贪污案犯共有六百五十人，尚未发现的会比这个数目多。为了进一步铲除贪污现象，树立巩固的廉洁的风气，各单位领导同志必须采取有效的办法进行系统深入的检查，并发动群众自下而上的进行群众性的检举，大张旗鼓，在全市范围内展开反贪污运动。
    到会的市协商委员会委员、市人民政府委员会委员和各单位负责干部听了彭真主席的发言，即相继发表意见，一致拥护开展反贪污运动。市人民政府委员会委员郑芸说：“现在我们来开展一个反贪污运动，就会使人民更加信任自己的政府。”市协商委员会委员舒舍予认为要杜绝贪污，一是制度要严，二是有些人家庭负担重，应当设法照顾他们。傅华亭说：“我们工商界一定热烈参加这个运动。我们工商界还有向工作人员行贿引诱的现象，我们认为彭市长指出行贿人和受贿人一样治罪是非常对的。我们工商联愿意来自己进行教育，克服这种恶劣现象。”雷洁琼、陈铭德、曾昭抡、钱端升、朱长江等均主张大张旗鼓地展开反贪污斗争。梁思成对展开反贪污运动表示热烈赞同，他说：“这样作，不但不会损害人民政府和共产党的威信，正好是更加提高政府和党的威信。”张奚若指出贪污是旧社会所留下的不良现象，人民政府是不能容许这种现象存在的。他说：“保障人民政府不腐化、不贪污的是两条：事前教育，事后严办。”陈垣提出使贪污的人不敢贪污、不能贪污、不至于贪污和不必要贪污的四条办法，他说：“严办，使他不敢；制度，使他不能；教育，使他不至于贪污；还有些人家庭儿女负担重，生活困难，适当的调整他们的待遇，就可以使他们不必要贪污了。”
    为了反对贪污浪费，市人民政府所属各单位最近都已作了一些准备工作。各部门负责人在发言中，都认为目前开展反贪污运动是十分必要的，他们保证认真地、负责地做好这个工作。市财经委员会副主任程宏毅说：“这个运动，在财经部门特别需要。财经部门的负责干部，一定要认识这个反贪污运动的政治意义，切实把运动领导起来，发动群众检举和机关内部严格检查，清除一切贪污分子。”市供销合作总社主任王纯报告合作社系统最近进行初步检查的情况，他说：“合作社中的贪污现象是很严重的。据最近检查的材料，第九区区联社一百三十二个工作人员中，就发现了三十九个大大小小的贪污分子，第六区合作社一百五十个工作人员中，就有三十四人贪污。这是由于我们缺乏教育，缺乏检查。希望在这次反贪污运动中，能得到群众的检举和监督，帮助我们改造合作社的工作人员，真正树立起为人民服务的作风。”中国人民银行北京分行行长贾星五、市工商局副局长张锦城都说：除了内部发动工作人员坦白、检举以外，还希望广大人民协助，大家来检举贪污。市公安局副局长冯基平说：“我们欢迎广大市民对公安人员的贪污行为进行检举，不要有任何顾虑。”市人民法院院长王斐然分析法院处理的一百五十三件贪污案，其中只有一件是因为生活困难而挪用公款，其他都是因为生活腐化、被人引诱和勾结工商业中的坏分子进行贪污。
    最后，彭真主席综合大家的意见作了总结性的发言，他说：今天我们对反贪污的问题初步交换了意见，大家提出了许多很好的意见。过几天，我们市协商委员会和市人民政府委员会将再开一次联席会议，来订出一个关于开展增产节约反贪污浪费运动的具体计划，经过市各界人民代表会议来作全面布置。我们相信，经过这次大张旗鼓的反贪污斗争，将给予贪污分子以致命打击，更圆满地树立人民政府廉洁的作风和进一步转变社会上残留的坏风气。
