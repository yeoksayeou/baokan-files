The majority of the sixteen or seventeen cotton textile factories in the Sunan district that are focused on promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method have misunderstood its significance. They mistakenly believe that the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method is simply the so-called "three diligences and three quicks," which amounts to purely increasing labor intensity. As a result of promoting it in this way, the rate of lap waste did decrease for a very short time; however, it was not long before the workers could not keep up and opposed the promotion of this "three diligences and three quicks" work method. Naturally, it is difficult to continue the promotion work. According to preliminary understanding, this error was caused by the fact that the Party, administration, and trade union in each factory did not pay enough attention to the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method. At the same time, the Chinese Textile Trade Union's Sunan District Committee did not promptly inspect the progress of the promotion work. The Sunan District Committee should mobilize the masses to conduct an inspection in a timely manner, and thoroughly expose all phenomena of not paying attention to the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method.

    中国纺织工会苏南区委员会
    应检查在推广郝建秀工作法中的各种错误作法
    苏南区已经重点推广郝建秀工作法的十六、七个棉纺织厂中，大多数都把郝建秀工作法的意义理解错了。他们错误地认为郝建秀工作法的精神，就是单纯增加劳动强度的所谓“三勤三快”。这样推广的结果，在开始的很短时间内，皮辊花也曾一度降低；但是，为时不久，工人就坚持不下去，而反对推广这种“三勤三快”的工作法了。推广工作自然很难继续下去。据初步了解，这种错误的造成，是由于各厂的党、行政和工会对郝建秀工作法的推广工作不够重视，同时，中国纺织工会苏南区委员会对推广工作的情况，也没有及时进行检查。苏南区委员会应该及时发动群众进行检查，彻底揭发各种不重视推广郝建秀工作法的现象。
