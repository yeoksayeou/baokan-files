    Waste of Electricity Should Be Corrected
    Comrade Editor: I have seen some government departments and organizations still wasting electricity when using lights. For example, some offices only have two or three people working, but they turn on all the lights, and even leave the lights on when nobody is in the room. Now that we have entered winter, it gets dark very early, so we should pay even more attention to saving electricity. When I worked at the Taiyuan Public Security Department, I saw many comrades playing poker and billiards under strong electric lights, playing until one or two o'clock in the morning, and some even didn't turn off the lights when they went to sleep. If this serious waste of electricity continues, it will cause great losses to national property. I calculated that a 60-watt light bulb used for five hours a night will consume more than fifteen units of electricity on the meter in a month. If one unit of electricity is calculated at 1,500 yuan, then fifteen units would be 22,500 yuan. If the Taiyuan Public Security Department wasted the electricity of an average of five lights per month in the past, then it would waste 112,500 yuan of national property; three months of winter would be more than 337,000 yuan. I think this waste of electricity must also exist in other government agencies and organizations throughout the country. Therefore, I hope
    that all agencies will pay attention to this matter to reduce public expenditure and use the saved electricity for production. Wang Ze

    应该纠正浪费电力现象
    编辑同志：我见到有些机关单位在使用电灯上，还有浪费现象。例如有的办公室里只有两三个人工作，竟把全部电灯都开着，甚至屋里没人也开着电灯。现在已经进入冬季，天黑得很早，因此，就更应当注意节省电力。我在太原公安处工作时，曾看到有许多同志在强度的电灯光下玩扑克、打克郎球，一玩就玩到夜里一、二点钟，甚至有的人睡觉都不熄灯。如果这种严重的浪费电力现象再继续下去，将会使国家财产遭到很大的损失。我算了一下：一个六十度的灯每晚用五小时，一个月在电表上要走十五个字以上；一个字的电力如以一千五百元计算，十五个字就是二万二千五百元。如果过去太原公安处每月平均以浪费五个灯的电力计算，那么就要浪费国家财产十一万二千五百元；冬天三个月就是三十三万七千多元。我想这种浪费电力现象在全国其他机关、团体也一定会有的。因此我希望
    各机关对这事加以注意，以减少公家的开支，把节约的电力用在生产事业上。　王　则
