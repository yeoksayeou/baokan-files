The Xiaoxiao River Dam, the second modernized water conservancy project in Shanxi Province after the Hutuo River Dam, and the Minfeng and Minsheng Canals have been completed. Next spring, 450,000 mu of farmland in 122 villages along the river will be irrigated.

The Xiaoxiao River originates from Douquan Ridge in the southwest of Pindging County, Shanxi Province, flows through Shouyang, Yuci, Xugou, Jinyuan, Qingyuan and five other counties, and flows into the Fen River. It is a major tributary of the Fen River. The climate in the area along the river is dry, and the average rainfall between July and August each year is only 90 millimeters, and the evaporation is greater than the rainfall, so the crops are in great need of irrigation. On the other hand, the Xiaoxiao River has been in disrepair for many years, and whenever mountain torrents break out, the lower reaches are always flooded. In order to promote benefits and eliminate harm, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau sent personnel to measure, survey, and plan to build the Xiaoxiao River Dam in 1949. The dam construction project officially started in September last year with the help of Soviet experts.

The Xiaoxiao River Dam is located in Yuanguo Town, five miles east of Yuci County. The main parts of the dam, such as the spillway, sand flushing gate, and water inlet gate, are all built with cement and reinforced concrete. The spillway is 347.2 meters long, and canals are opened from both ends of the dam; the one on the right is called the Minfeng Canal, which can irrigate 200,000 mu of land; the one on the left is called the Minsheng Canal, which can irrigate 250,000 mu of land.

The Hutuo River Dam was completed and released water on May 26 this year.

The machine wells dug in the suburbs of Beijing are using mechanical power to pump water to irrigate rice fields.

The "Liberation" style waterwheel, in a well thirty feet deep (from the water surface to the wellhead), uses a donkey to pull it, and can irrigate four mu of land for ten hours a day.

### 山西潇河大坝完工  四十五万亩地可得到灌溉

    山西潇河大坝完工
    四十五万亩地可得到灌溉
    继滹沱河大坝筑成后，山西省第二个近代化的水利工程潇河大坝和民丰、民生两渠已经完工。明春沿河一百二十二个村的四十五万亩耕地就可得到灌溉。
    潇河发源在山西省平定县西南的陡泉岭，经寿阳、榆次、徐沟、晋源、清源等五县流入汾河，是汾河一大支流。沿河地区气候干燥，每年七八月间平均雨量只有九十公厘，蒸发量比雨量大，田禾极需灌溉。另一方面，潇河多年失修，每当山洪暴发，下游总要淹没耕地。为了兴利除害，一九四九年山西省人民政府水利局就派员测量，勘察，计划修潇河大坝。修坝工程在苏联专家的帮助下，在去年九月正式动工。
    潇河大坝坝址在榆次县城东五里的源锅镇，坝的主要部分滚水坝、冲沙闸、进水闸等，都是用水泥钢筋筑成的。滚水坝全长三百四十七点二公尺，从坝的两端开渠；右边的叫民丰渠，可浇地二十万亩；左边的叫民生渠，可浇地二十五万亩。

    滹沱河大坝今年五月二十六日落成放水。
