Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. At the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the morning of the 20th, our representative refuted the opposing side's untrue argument that our December 14th proposal was no different from our December 3rd proposal on the issue of rotating armed personnel.

The other side repeatedly attempted to deny our concession to them in the December 14th proposal by citing the provisions that the maximum limit for the rotation of armed personnel during the armistice period was 5,000 people in and out each month, and that the rotation in Korea had to be approved by the Military Armistice Commission. Our representative pointed out that if this argument from the other side was not intentional, then their suspicion was also unfounded. We believe that the rotation of 5,000 armed personnel per month can generally meet the needs of the other side. If the rotation that the other side will conduct during the armistice period is indeed based on a one-in, one-out basis as they claim, and the number of rotations is indeed within the limit agreed upon by both sides, then the Military Armistice Commission has no reason to disagree, and approval will only be a matter of formality.

But the other side once again arrogantly claimed that they have sufficient military power to interfere in all our internal affairs, that their agreement to negotiate an armistice was a concession to our side, and that only requesting restrictions on our airport facilities after the armistice was a major concession to our side.

Our representative denounced the other side's arrogant and shameless attitude of overestimating their capabilities and attempting to threaten our side, pointing out that if the other side actually considers themselves victors and refuses to negotiate in a fair and equal manner, then they are welcome to leave the meeting and announce the termination of the armistice negotiations. Our side has always kept the door to negotiations open, but the other side must abandon their victor's attitude and abandon all their absurd demands to interfere in our internal affairs. We have repeatedly made reasonable concessions to the other side on the issue of rear area inspections and the issue of rotating armed personnel, but fair and equal negotiations cannot be achieved solely through the efforts of our side. Only seven days remain in the thirty-day deadline. If the warmongers on the other side deliberately sabotage the armistice negotiations and insist on interfering in our internal affairs, then the other side will have to bear all the responsibility for delaying and sabotaging the armistice negotiations.

In the afternoon of the 20th, the other side suggested that staff officers from both sides tentatively rewrite the principle proposals put forward by both sides. Based on our consistent attitude of not rejecting any efforts by the other side to break the deadlock, we agreed. However, at the staff officers' meeting from 4:00 PM to 5:50 PM, the other side still insisted on its absurd demands to interfere in our internal affairs without any change.

The staff officers' meeting between the two sides will continue at 10:00 AM on the 21st, and the subcommittee meeting is scheduled to be held at 1:00 PM on the 21st.

Before the end of the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item on the 20th, our representative, on the orders of our chief representative, proposed to the other side to reconvene the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item as soon as possible, and pointed out that since prisoner of war information has been exchanged for three days, the other side should no longer delay the discussion and arrangement of the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war.

    美方继续坚持干涉我方内政的荒谬要求
    我痛斥美方不自量力的无耻态度
    我方代表奉命提出早日重开第四项议程小组委员会的建议
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日上午朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表驳斥了对方所谓我方十二月十四日的方案在轮换武装人员的问题上，与我方十二月三日的方案并无不同的不符事实的论点。
    对方一再企图藉口我方十二月十四日的方案中对于停战期间武装人员的轮换每月以进出口五千人为最高限额，以及在朝鲜的轮换须经军事停战委员会批准的规定，否定我方这一方案对于对方的让步。我方代表指出如果对方的这一论点并非出之于故意，则对方的这种怀疑也是毫无根据的。我方认为每月五千武装人员的轮换大体上是可以满足对方的需要的。如果对方在停战期间所将进行的轮换确如对方声称的是在一人进一人出的基础上进行的，而其轮换人数又确在双方同意的限额内，则军事停战委员会就没有不同意的理由，批准将只是一个手续问题。
    但对方却又一次狂妄地自称，他们有充分的军事力量干涉我一切内政，其同意谈判停战就是对我方的一个让步，而在停战后仅要求限制我方的机场设备，则更为对我方的一大让步。
    我方代表痛斥对方这种不自量力妄图威胁我方的狂妄无耻的态度，指出：如果对方竟然以战胜者自居，拒绝以公平对等的态度进行谈判，则对方尽可走离会场，宣布终止停战谈判。我方始终敞开谈判之门，但对方必须放弃其战胜者的态度，放弃其一切干涉我方内政的荒谬要求。我方在后方视察问题上，在轮换武装人员的问题上，已经一再地对对方作了合理的让步，但公平对等的谈判，不可能由于我方单方面的努力而达成协议。三十天的期限仅余七天，如果对方的好战分子蓄意破坏停战谈判，坚持干涉我内政，则对方将必须担负拖延与破坏停战谈判的一切责任。
    二十日下午，对方建议由双方参谋人员试行改写双方所提出的原则建议，我方本着不拒绝对方打开僵局的任何努力的一贯态度，予以同意。但在下午四时至五时五十分的参谋人员的会议上，对方仍然毫无变更地坚持其干涉我内政的荒谬主张。
    双方参谋人员会议将在二十一日上午十时继续举行，小组会议定于二十一日下午一时举行。
    在二十日第三项议程的小组委员会结束前，我方代表奉我方首席代表之命，向对方提出早日重行召开第四项议程的小组会的建议，并指出俘虏资料既已交换三日，对方不应再拖延释放与遣送全部战俘的讨论与安排。
