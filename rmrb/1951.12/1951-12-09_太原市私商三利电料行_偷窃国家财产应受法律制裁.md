    Taiyuan City Private Merchant Sanli Electrical Material Store
    Should Be Punished by Law for Stealing State Property
    To the Editor: The Taiyuan City Tax Bureau's inspection of tax evasion revealed that the private merchant Sanli Electrical Material Store had engaged in acts of stealing state property. In September of last year, when Yongmao Construction Company contracted to build a building and dormitory project for a certain Railway Bureau, the electrical materials portion was subcontracted to Sanli Electrical Material Store. At that time, it was stipulated that all labor and materials must be reported and calculated accurately. During construction, Sanli Electrical Material Store delivered materials to the construction site every day. These materials were inspected by the person in charge of the construction site before being used and settled. Because the person in charge of the construction site was negligent, Sanli Electrical Material Store took the opportunity to under-report and over-report twice, stealing a total of eighty-nine iron pipes and more than eighty coils of wire, estimated to be worth more than 18 million yuan. I believe that this illegal behavior of Sanli Electrical Material Store should be punished by law, and relevant departments should handle it quickly. Responsible cadres of Yongmao Construction Company should also conduct a good inspection and investigate responsibility.

    太原市私商三利电料行
    偷窃国家财产应受法律制裁
    编辑同志：太原市税务局检查漏税，发现私商三利电料行有窃取国家财产的行为。去年九月间，永茂建筑公司包揽某铁路局修建大楼和宿舍工程时，把电料部分转包给三利电料行。当时规定凡工料必须实报、实算。在施工中，三利电料行每天往工地运送材料，这些材料经工地负责人检验后，再行使用和结算。因为工地负责人麻痹大意，三利电料行竟趁机两次以少报多，共窃取了铁管八十九条，电线八十多盘，估计值一千八百多万元。我认为三利电料行这种非法行为，应受到法律制裁，有关部门应迅速处理。永茂建筑公司负责干部也应很好地检查，并追究责任。    李全喜  程长庆
