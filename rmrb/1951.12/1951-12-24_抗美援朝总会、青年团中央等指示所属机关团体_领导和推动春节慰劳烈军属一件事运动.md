(Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd) The China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and the Broadcasting Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government News Administration, issued a joint instruction to their subordinate organs and groups on the 22nd to quickly launch the "National Children's Spring Festival Comfort for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers Movement". The instructions require all subordinate units to quickly establish a unified organization to promote and lead this movement, and stipulate that the mobilization target of this movement should mainly be students in grades 4 to 9 of primary and secondary schools in large and medium-sized cities, and other organized children of the same age. The activity format should be mainly collective (i.e., in groups or teams) comfort. The activity time should be uniformly from January 20 to February 10, 1952 throughout the country. The instructions point out that the basic spirit of this movement lies in educating and exercising patriotism and social activities among children across the country through Spring Festival comfort activities. Therefore, in the movement, all subordinate units should guide children to collectively find ways based on the actual needs of the specific comfort targets, and solve some difficulties for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with practical methods. At the same time, they should also carry out propaganda on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and increasing production and practicing economy to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and do not emphasize material comfort, or ask them to do things that children cannot afford, such as heavy physical labor. In order to give play to the enthusiasm of children and exchange mutual experience, the instructions require that after the children's comfort, they should make written or oral reports to the local radio stations, and outstanding reports should be selected from the children's reports and broadcast on the People's Broadcasting Station. At the same time, local families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers should be invited to speak. The Central People's Broadcasting Station will, starting from February 1952, successively broadcast outstanding reports or recordings sent from all parts of the country, and distribute the most outstanding reports or recordings to People's Broadcasting Stations throughout the country for broadcasting.

    领导和推动春节慰劳烈军属一件事运动
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中央人民政府教育部和中央人民政府新闻总署广播事业局，为迅速展开“全国少年儿童春节慰劳烈、军属一件事运动”，二十二日发出给所属机关、团体的联合指示。指示要求各所属单位，应迅速成立一统一组织，以推动和领导这一运动，并规定这一运动的动员对象，以大、中城市的小学四年级到中学三年级的学生和同等年龄和其他有组织的少年儿童为主，活动形式以集体的（即以小组或小队为单位）慰劳为主。活动时间全国一律自一九五二年一月二十日到二月十日为止。指示指出这一运动的基本精神，在于通过春节慰劳活动，使全国少年儿童受到爱国主义的教育和社会活动的锻炼。因此在运动中，各所属单位应指导少年儿童根据具体慰劳对象的实际需要，集体想办法，以切实可行的办法为烈、军属解决某些困难，同时并向烈、军属进行关于抗美援朝、增产节约的宣传，而不要强调物质的慰劳，或是叫他们去做非少年儿童所能负担的事情，如强烈的体力劳动等。为着发挥少年儿童的积极性和交流相互的经验，指示要求在少年儿童慰劳之后，要他们向当地的广播电台作书面或口头的报告，并应从少年儿童的报告中挑选出优秀的报告在人民广播电台广播，同时邀请当地烈、军属讲话。中央人民广播电台将从一九五二年二月起，陆续播送全国各地送来的优秀者的报告或录音，并将最优秀者的报告或录音分送全国各地人民广播电台播送。
