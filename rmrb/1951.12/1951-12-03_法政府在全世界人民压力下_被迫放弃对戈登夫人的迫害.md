    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch – The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently received a letter dated November 5th from Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, reporting that under pressure from people worldwide, the French government has been forced to abandon its unreasonable persecution of Mrs. Gordon, Chairwoman of the Women's International Democratic Federation and Chairwoman of the French Women's Union. In May 1950, the French judicial authorities, on the pretext that the French Women's Union had printed and distributed propaganda posters against the massacre of the Vietnamese people, brought "charges" against Mrs. Gordon for "undermining morale and attempting to obstruct national defense." Subsequently, in November of the same year, they illegally handed the case over to a military tribunal for trial. However, this act of persecution by the French government was met with strong protests from people all over the world and the French people. Under this protest, the French judicial authorities had no choice but to change their plans and transfer the case to an ordinary criminal court for handling in December of the same year. Encouraged by this initial victory, the protest movement of people worldwide and the French people developed even more vigorously. On the occasion of Mrs. Gordon's 70th birthday in October 1951, people all over the world sent tens of thousands of letters and telegrams in support of Mrs. Gordon. Thus, this powerful movement finally forced the French judicial authorities to announce the withdrawal of the unreasonable charges against Mrs. Gordon on October 26th. In her letter, Vaillant-Couturier pointed out that this is a victory for people worldwide. It proves that "whenever we act in unison, our strength is even greater."

    法政府在全世界人民压力下
    被迫放弃对戈登夫人的迫害
    【新华社一日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会最近收到了国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦扬—古久里十一月五日的来信，报告法国政府在全世界人民的压力下，已被迫放弃对国际民主妇女联合会主席和法兰西妇女联盟主席戈登夫人的无理迫害。一九五○年五月，法国司法当局藉口法兰西妇女联盟曾印发反对屠杀越南人民的宣传画，对戈登夫人以“败坏士气及企图妨害国防”的罪名提出了“控诉”，接着又在同年十一月把这个案件非法交给军事法庭审理。但是，法国政府这种迫害行动受到了全世界人民和法国人民的强烈抗议。在这种抗议下，法国司法当局不得不改变计划而在同年十二月又把该案移交给普通刑事法庭处理。全世界人民和法国人民的抗议运动受到了这个初步胜利的鼓舞，因此更加蓬勃开展。一九五一年十月戈登夫人七十寿辰时，全世界人民曾发出了成千成万封支援戈登夫人的信件和电报。这样，这个声势浩大的运动终于迫使法国司法当局在十月二十六日宣布撤销对戈登夫人的无理控诉。瓦扬—古久里夫人在信里指出：这是全世界人民的一个胜利。它证明：“每逢我们一致行动起来，我们的力量就更加强大。”
