    Northern Jiangsu Yancheng Prefecture
    Launches Mass Anti-Waste Campaign

    Editor: The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Northern Jiangsu Yancheng Prefectural Committee has attached great importance to the extravagance and waste of some cadres, and has decided to use typical cases of corruption and waste to educate party members and cadres in various counties of Yancheng Prefecture, and launch a mass anti-waste campaign. For example, when Shen Yun, the public security assistant of Yongfeng District, Jianhu County, arranged a wedding for his son, he held forty-eight tables of banquets and collected a large amount of gifts, totaling 3.86 million yuan. After discovering this, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Jianhu County Committee made the following decisions: 1. Give Shen Yun a warning within the Party; 2. Deduct the cost of the banquet from the gifts received, and return the rest to the masses; 3. Shen Yun should conduct a profound self-criticism at the district cadre meeting and village mass meeting. At the same time, the handling of this matter was circulated to all branches in the county for education.

    The CPC Yancheng County Committee also adopted this method to correct the wasteful behavior of party members and cadres. I think the method of launching a mass anti-waste campaign by combining typical cases in Yancheng Prefecture is very good and worthy of reference by other regions.　Yuan Yinong

    苏北盐城专区
    展开群众性反浪费运动
    编辑同志：中共苏北盐城地委纪律检查委员会对某些干部的铺张浪费现象已引起极大的重视，决定在盐城专区各县用某些贪污浪费的典型事例教育党员干部，展开群众性的反浪费运动。如建湖县永丰区公安助理员沈云给儿子办理婚事时，办了四十八桌酒席，大收人情，共收礼三百八十六万元。中共建湖县委纪律检查委员会在发现这事后，便作如下处理：一、给沈云以党内警告处分；二、所收礼金扣除酒席用费外，其余退还群众；三、由沈云在区干部会和乡村群众会上进行深刻检讨。同时并把这事处理情形通报全县各支部进行教育。
    中共盐城县委也采用这种办法，纠正党员干部的浪费现象。我认为盐城专区这种结合典型事例展开群众性反浪费运动的办法是很好的，值得其他地区参考。　袁一农
