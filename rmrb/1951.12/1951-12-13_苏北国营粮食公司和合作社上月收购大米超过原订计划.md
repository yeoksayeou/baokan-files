    The state-owned grain company and cooperatives in Northern Jiangsu Province exceeded the original plan for rice procurement by 20 percent in November. Currently, the company and cooperatives are continuing to expand their procurement efforts. After the new grain came on the market, the state-owned grain company in Northern Jiangsu Province, in addition to entrusting more than 500 cooperatives in various grain-producing areas to purchase on its behalf, also organized 75 mobile teams to go deep into the countryside for procurement. The Taizhou City State-owned Grain Company specifically established a farmer service center to provide farmers who come to the city to sell rice with convenient food and lodging. The industrial and commercial administrative departments of governments at all levels in Northern Jiangsu Province paid attention to organizing joint purchases by public and private forces, organizing joint operations of grain shops and grain stores, and strengthening market management, so that grain prices in the entire region remained stable. These are the factors that enabled the smooth completion of the procurement task.

    苏北国营粮食公司和合作社上月收购大米超过原订计划
    苏北区国营粮食公司和合作社十一月份收购大米数量超过原计划百分之二十。目前，该公司和合作社正继续扩大收购中。苏北区国营粮食公司在新谷上市后，除委托各产粮区五百多个合作社代购外，又组织了七十五个流动小组深入农村收购。泰州市国营粮食公司专门设立了农民服务所，给进城出售大米的农民以食宿便利。苏北区各级人民政府工商行政部门注意组织公私力量联购，组织粮行、粮店联营，加强市场管理，使全区粮价保持平稳。这些都是使收购任务顺利完成的因素。（新华社）
