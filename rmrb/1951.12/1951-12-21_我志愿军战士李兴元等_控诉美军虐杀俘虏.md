Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 17th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers Li Xingyuan, Yu Youxiu, and Xu Yinfu angrily accused the American aggressor troops and the Li puppet army of bloody atrocities in mistreating and killing captured personnel of our army.

They were captured on November 26th of last year in the battle south of the Cheongcheon River. They said: "After we were captured, the American aggressor troops wanted to send us from Gunuri to Cheonggok-ri. We all refused to go, and the bandits violently beat us with their rifle butts. Three people were beaten until their skin was torn and bleeding all over. On the 30th, when the American aggressor troops were fleeing, they drove the three of us and more than fifty other comrades, as well as more than five hundred Korean civilians, into a mountain gully southwest of Cheonggok-ri, Gasan County. They forcibly blindfolded us with cloth and then beat us as we walked with the butts of their guns. Before we had gone far, all kinds of bullets were shot at us. After the three of us fell down, several other people fell on top of us. When the enemy left, we took off the cloth and saw that the people who had fallen on us had all died. Looking around, many comrades and civilians had also been killed. Among these civilians were teenagers, young women who had been raped by the enemy, and elderly men in their seventies and eighties. Such atrocities are even worse than the atrocities committed by the Japanese devils in China. We must avenge this!"

Liu Zejun, a squad leader of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, also accused the enemy army of atrocities based on facts he witnessed, saying: "During the battle of Unsan last year, when our troops recovered a position, we found the bodies of captured soldiers Chen Zhensheng and Zhu Tiansheng lying on the rice field, blood flowing all over the ground. Their bodies were covered with holes stabbed by bayonets, and long cuts were made all over them. It was obvious that the enemy killed them when they were retreating."

The enemy's atrocities against captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies continue to be confirmed by the confessions of enemy prisoners. According to a corporal of the U.S. aggressor army's Second Infantry Division, "In a certain battle, we captured a Korean People's Army soldier. Because he was very stubborn, the company commander ordered him to be shot." A soldier of the medical squad of the Second Battalion, Thirty-first Regiment of the Li puppet army also confessed that in September of this year, near Cheonbul Mountain, southeast of Kimhwa, He Xiangdao, the squad leader of the squad, shot and killed a captured member of the Volunteer Army with a carbine. Another Li puppet army prisoner also confessed to the enemy's killing of prisoners. He said: "In early November of this year, I personally saw the director of the regiment headquarters and three American advisors mutter a few words, and then ordered his liaison officer to drag two captured personnel of the North Korean army to the hill and shoot them."

　　我志愿军战士李兴元等
    控诉美军虐杀俘虏
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】中国人民志愿军某部战士李兴元、于有秀、徐银福愤怒地控诉美国侵略军和李伪军虐待和残杀我军被俘人员的血腥暴行。
    他们是去年十一月二十六日在清川江以南地区的战斗中被俘的。他们说：“我们在被俘之后，美国侵略军要把我们从军隅里送到青谷里去。我们都不肯走，匪兵们就狠命地用枪柄打我们，有三个人被打得皮开肉烂，满身是血。三十日下午，美国侵略军在溃逃的时候，就把我们三个人和其他五十多个同志，五百多个朝鲜老百姓，都赶到价川郡青谷里西南的一个山沟里去。他们强横地用布蒙住了我们的眼睛，然后用枪柄打着我们走，走不多远，各种枪弹就向我们打来了。我们三个人倒下去以后，接着有几个人跌在我们的身上。等敌人走了，我们把布揭开一看，倒在我们身上的人都已经死去，再向四周一看，许多同志和老百姓也都被打死了。这些老百姓中有十几岁的小孩子，有被敌人糟蹋过的青年妇女，还有七、八十岁的老大爷。象这样的暴行，实在比日本鬼子在中国的暴行还要厉害，我们一定要报这个仇！”
    志愿军某部班长刘泽君也以亲眼看见的事实控诉敌军的暴行，他说：“在去年云山战斗中，当我们部队收复一个阵地的时候，我们发现被俘战士陈振生、朱田生的尸体倒在稻场上，鲜血流了一地，身上尽是被刺刀戳的窟隆，还有被割开的一条一条的长口子。这显然是敌人在退走时把他们杀死的。”
    敌军残杀朝、中人民军队被俘人员的暴行也继续为敌军俘虏的口供所证实。据美国侵略军步兵第二师的一个伍长供称：“在某一次战斗中，我们俘虏了一名朝鲜人民军，因为他很倔强，连长就下令把他枪毙了。”李伪军第二师三十一联队二大队医务中队的士兵也供认在今年九月间在金化东南千佛山附近，该中队中队长何相道用卡宾枪打死了一个志愿军的被俘人员。另一个李伪军俘虏也供出了敌军残杀俘虏的事实。他说：“今年十一月上旬，我亲眼看见联队部的主任和三个美国顾问咕噜了几句话之后，就命令他的联络员把北朝鲜军队的两个被俘人员，拉到山岗上打死了。”
