    Guangshan County Grain Bureau Builds Warehouses Against Higher Authority Regulations, Leading to Collapses and Waste

    To the Editor: The Guangshan County Grain Bureau in Henan Province does not pay enough attention to warehouse construction projects, resulting in warehouse collapses and waste. Before the construction of open-air warehouses, the Huangchuan Special District Grain Bureau stipulated that the design should be circular, with thirty-four wooden pillars erected around the perimeter, buried in the ground, and then a two-foot-high, one-foot-eight-inch-wide brick wall built around the wooden pillars. This summer, when the Guangshan County Grain Bureau built warehouses, they violated this regulation by not burying the wooden pillars in the ground. Instead, they first built the brick wall, then inserted the thirty-four wooden pillars into the holes of the short timbers on top of the surrounding wall, making the foundation unstable. On October 18th, as soon as one open-air warehouse was erected, the entire roof frame collapsed, injuring fourteen carpenters. The other three open-air warehouses, two of them were already tilting when they were being erected.

    In terms of material usage, there was also significant waste. For example, the Huangchuan Special District Grain Bureau originally stipulated that each open-air warehouse should use eighty pieces of timber, but they used one hundred and forty-one pieces, exceeding the quota by seventy-six percent. In addition, without obtaining approval from higher authorities, they privately sold 200,000 jin of public grain (wheat). At the time, the selling price was 540 yuan per jin, but the next day, the price of wheat rose to over 600 yuan per jin, resulting in a loss of over 40,000 jin of wheat.

    光山县粮食局建仓不依上级规定
    发生仓库倒塌和浪费现象
    编辑同志：河南光山县粮食局不重视建造仓库工程，造成仓库倒塌和浪费现象。在建造露天仓以前，潢川专区粮食局规定图样为圆形，周围立木柱三十四根，栽入土内，再砌二尺高、一尺八寸宽的砖墙夹着木柱。今年夏天，光山县粮食局建仓时，违反这个规定，不把木柱栽入土内，而是先砌好砖墙，再将三十四根木柱插在周围墙顶上短木的眼内，使基础不稳。十月十八日，一座露天仓刚架好，屋架全部倒塌，跌伤和打伤木工十四人。另三座露天仓，其中二座仓库正上架时已告歪斜。
    在使用材料方面，也有很大浪费。比如潢川专区粮食局原规定每座露天仓用木料八十根，他们却用一百四十一根，超过了百分之七十六。另外，他们没有经过上级支拨，私自变卖公粮（小麦）二十万斤，当时卖价每斤五百四十元，卖后第二天，小麦就涨到六百多元一斤，计亏损小麦四万余斤。
