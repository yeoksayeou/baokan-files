    Criticizing My Old Thoughts
    Wang Jiaji, Director of the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    I am a scientific worker who was entirely educated in the old society. In the past, I confined myself to the laboratory and considered myself "pure." Now, looking back and carefully examining myself, I find that the mistakes I made in the past were too numerous. I committed almost every fault that a petty-bourgeois intellectual is prone to. The following is my own example, and I am very willing to present it so that everyone understands that someone like me is not worthy of being a servant of the people if I do not change my mindset.
    I grew up in a typical feudal family, and since entering elementary school, my mind has been filled with thoughts of climbing upward. When I was in elementary school, my father once hired a fortune teller. After arranging my birth chart, the fortune teller respectfully said, "This young master's birth chart is the 'Double Flying Butterflies' pattern, an exceptionally noble configuration. Once he dedicates himself to study, he will surely be famous." My father was, of course, extremely excited. I was only seven or eight years old at the time, standing beside him, and couldn't help but smile with joy. After graduating from university in my twenties and before going abroad to study, I would still look at my fortune chart during summer and winter vacations, taking pleasure in it. At that time, I was already a budding biologist and had some understanding of Darwin's theory, but I was still pitifully deluded by this nonsense about "fate." In the old society, undoubtedly, my ideology only concerned my personal future, and I always put personal interests first; otherwise, I would never have been deluded by this nonsense about "fate." Later, I even mocked those who climbed faster, climbed higher, or climbed all the way on top of the people, saying that they were opportunistic, base, and despicable. But now, thinking back, wasn't I also in the process of climbing at the time? It was just that the rate and manner of climbing were somewhat different.
    Since entering Nanjing Higher Normal School, I have not used a penny from my hometown. At that time, I felt very satisfied with myself, thinking that I could be worthy of my hometown. I didn't know that the money from my hometown was all squeezed from the peasants. The white rice I ate at the Higher Normal School and the four or five thousand US dollars in Jiangsu provincial funds I used for studying abroad for four years were also the blood and sweat of the people. In short, I have been using the blood and sweat of the people to study all my life. After returning from studying abroad, although I taught at Central University for five years, the students I taught were all children of landlords, the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie; I never taught a worker or peasant child. Although I also did some research work, it was all circling within my own small scope, without any planning. On a whim, if I wanted to study amoebas today, I would study amoebas; if I wanted to work on ciliates tomorrow, I would work on ciliates. I didn't ask whether the things I did and worked on would benefit the people. Until liberation, for nearly thirty years, my work was almost all divorced from reality, and my style was consistently free and undisciplined. At that time, in the field of protozoology, which I specialized in, no one in the country was more senior or more renowned than I was. If I published a few more papers domestically this year, I could raise my status somewhat; if I published a few more papers in foreign journals next year, I could greatly enhance my status. When people complimented me, I was superficially humble, but in my heart, I felt really good. I had a strong sense that "now, in China, who else is there in protozoology but me?" At that time, I also hoped to do my work well, but the purpose of hoping was: the better the work, the more firmly I could stand in the scientific community, and I could also rely on my seniority to consolidate my position. The slogan of serving the people was only heard after liberation.
    The former Central University was developed and changed from Nanjing Higher Normal School and Southeast University. Therefore, a small group within Central University was later referred to as the "Nangao Dongda" group. This small group was full of the conservatism of cherishing the old and the narrowness of sectarianism. I was a product hatched very early within this small group, and the general ideological situation of the small group greatly influenced my ideological situation. When the May Fourth Movement had just begun, Peking University advocated using vernacular Chinese, and Nanjing Higher Normal School rose up to oppose it. At that time, the "Lunheng" published by Nanjing Higher Normal School was a tool for opposing vernacular Chinese. Although I had not published articles in "Lunheng," I was one of those who vocally opposed vernacular Chinese. It wasn't until after my daughter started school that, after studying for less than two years, she could pick up a pen and write letters that I stopped opposing it. The reason I stopped opposing it was only for the sake of my children's ease of studying; I myself was still fascinated by classical Chinese. Sometimes, when writing scientific articles, I even wanted to imitate the style of the Tongcheng School. I never asked myself whether the broad masses could understand such articles. During the Anti-Japanese War, when I was in Beibei, Sichuan, for at least two or three years, I spent most of my time writing classical poetry; I did very little professional work. I "cultivated my temperament," but the working people on the front lines and in the rear were being trampled on by Japanese imperialism and the reactionary government every day. What was their temperament like? By comparison, how could I be worthy of the people?
    From its beginning to the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the presidents of Central University, such as Zhu Jiahua, Luo Jialun, and Gu Mengyu, all came from Peking University or had close relations with Peking University. The "Nangao Dongda" group was always full of displeasure. The reason for the displeasure was not because these people were all ringleaders of counter-revolution; otherwise, even the bandit Chiang Kai-shek had once served as president, so why did no one come out to oppose him? The main reason for the displeasure was a sectarian concept. Central University put on a very large front, but the people high up on this large front were not from their own group, and the same "old enemies" were being rotated in and out, which they felt was improper. Not only was it bad for face, but they were also uncomfortable in their hearts. On the one hand, when Zhu Jiahua and others were presidents, they oppressed the teachers and students of the entire school in many ways; but on the other hand, this small group was also brewing the game of "Nangao, Dongda, Zhongda" being purebred within a college or department. No matter how bad their own students were, they would still be treated differently because they were their own. After I went to the Academia Sinica, when hiring young people, sometimes I hired more students who graduated from other universities and fewer or no students who graduated from Central University, I would be severely criticized for not taking care of my alma mater and department and forgetting my own place of origin. Sometimes, when hiring older people who could lead research, if I consulted with people in the group, the person who was ultimately recommended was none other than my own classmates. This group particularly regarded Fu Sinian and Wang Jingxi of Peking University as enemies. Their vision was not bad; these two were not only academic bullies in the past but had also embarked on the path of counter-revolution one after another. However, there were also counter-revolutionary elements within their own ranks, such as Zhang Qiyun. Not long after liberation, Central University was renamed Nanjing University, and many people felt very unnatural. Why didn't the People's Government change Central University back to the original Southeast University? Obviously, this was entirely due to the traditional thinking of sectarianism still at work.
    Now, all universities in New China, regardless of their name, should be controlled by the people and not be dominated by a small group. We must break down sectarian concepts, abandon small groups, and stand on the great position of wholeheartedly serving the people.
    In the past, I was not accustomed to collective life; I was afraid of organization and discipline. What I liked was a solitary life and a solitary working environment. I was very alienated from the masses. In 1934, I entered the Academia Sinica, which really suited my taste. Until liberation, for a full fifteen years, I served as a vase for the reactionary government, and I could not see the power of the masses. What about the masses for me? Not to mention a vase in the "Hanlin Academy" of the reactionary government, even a vase in a wealthy family, placed safely in the living room, the working people could hardly see. Even if they occasionally saw it, they would not dare to look at it more than once, let alone approach it and touch it with their hands? I still remember that when the bandit Chiang Kai-shek was about to become president, the puppet government was reorganized, and the Academia Sinica, led by Zhu Jiahua and Fu Sinian, seized the opportunity to be directly subordinate to the puppet presidential palace. Thus, the value of the vase increased a hundredfold. Eighty or ninety percent of the people in the whole institute also took it as a pleasure. I also remember that after the liberation of Shanghai in 1949, friends from the former Academia Sinica held several meetings to discuss how the new Chinese Academy of Sciences should be organized. Some people still wanted to consider the so-called issue of subordination, hoping to be subordinate to a higher level. But the main problem now is not the height of subordination but that each of us must establish a new position, new viewpoints, and new methods so that academic research is closely integrated with the actual needs of the broad masses of the people. Whether the subordination is high or low, we must wholeheartedly serve the people in the same way. The People's Government will no longer use us as vases. We should exert our strength as much as possible.
    Localism and closed-doorism were the consistent styles of the Academia Sinica in the past. The more funds a director of an institute fought for, the higher his administrative authority was considered. The more books and instruments a researcher bought, the greater his research ability was considered. Everyone only cared about expanding their own territory. With a large territory, they could boast to others. They had no time to take care of the overall situation of the entire institute, let alone take care of whether the people were suffering. They believed that their work was always superior to other people's work; the people they trained were always better than the people trained by others. Although they did not offend each other on the surface, they often spoke ill of each other behind their backs. There were often many gaps between researchers and researchers, institutes and institutes. Especially between the various institutes, there was very little interaction, and it was difficult to borrow instruments and medicines. The entire ivory tower was, of course, tightly closed. If it was like this internally, there was even less contact with the outside world. Moreover, with such a self-important attitude, people would retreat three houses when they saw us. How would they dare to approach us? In the past, people scolded the Academia Sinica for closed-doorism, but I always thought it had nothing to do with me. It was not Fu Sinian who was being scolded, but Wang Jingxi. It wasn't until the Chinese Academy of Sciences held its first council meeting in 1950, when the tasks and work plans of each institute were presented in group meetings for outside experts and representatives of industrial departments to provide opinions and criticisms, that I had never seen before, that I realized that I had also committed the mistake of closed-doorism in the past.
    After liberation, I suddenly heard the term "comprador scientist." I felt very strange; why would a scientist become a comprador? Later, after analyzing it, I found that there were indeed many scientists in the Academia Sinica who had comprador thoughts and styles. The most outstanding was Wang Jingxi. He looked down on every scientist in China. His colleagues around him were not in his eyes. If he was slightly dissatisfied, he would fly into a rage and curse wildly. But he was respectful to scientists in the United States, Britain, and other imperialist countries; his attitude was completely different. In his mind, only he in China was worthy of being a scientist. The other real scientists all grew up in American and British imperialist countries. China was not qualified to produce them. Only the work done by people in American and British imperialist countries could be done better than his. How could other Chinese people compare to him? Isn't this kind of behavior and thinking like a comprador in a foreign firm? Of all the secretaries-general of the Academia Sinica, the two I admired most were Ding Wenjiang and Sa Bendong. Their minds were also full of comprador thoughts. No matter what they said, they always said that the things in American and British imperialist countries were better than those in China. The two of them thought that I was not bad in every way, except for one thing they thought was a deficiency: my English was not very fluent when spoken, and it was not very good when written. But at that time, I wrote every one of my research papers in English. I said that I wrote in English to exchange with foreign scientists, but in my heart, I really had another thought: if I wrote in Chinese, I was afraid that it would lower the value of my paper. At that time, I strongly supported the Anglo-American policies implemented by Ding and Sa in the Academia Sinica. They were big compradores of Chinese science; I was also a small comprador of Chinese science, and I didn't even realize it! In the era of the reactionary government, whenever the Academia Sinica held a council meeting, if Hu Shi did not attend, it would be disappointing. Whoever could shake Hu Shi's hand for a few more seconds and talk to him for a few more minutes would feel honorable, and others would be jealous when they saw it. And Hu Shi, like the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, was a concubine of American imperialism!
    At the end of 1949, when the Chinese Academy of Sciences reorganized the former Academia Sinica, Peiping Research Institute, and other institutions, I was emotional for a long time and went through many intense ideological struggles. At that time, the mistakes everyone made were nothing more than two: one was unwilling to abandon the small circle, and the other was unwilling to change one's interests. The small circle is the small group, which can no longer exist and must be broken. Personal interests are, of course, very important. If one is not interested in the work one is doing, it will be difficult to do it well. But the needs of the people are especially more important than personal interests. If we can truly stand on the people's position, learn from the masses, and thoroughly understand the current urgent needs of the country, I think new interests will also emerge. We will also unconsciously be willing to change our original direction of work to match the work that the country urgently needs. We must understand that China has reached an unprecedentedly great new era, and everything belongs to the people. Science is no exception and also belongs to the people. Therefore, the starting point of our work is also unconditionally for the people, solving problems for the people, and seeking benefits for the people. We can no longer follow the example of American and British scientists who serve the bourgeoisie. We can no longer emphasize personal interests. We must learn from Soviet scientists and emulate their spirit and methods of serving the broad masses of the people.
    The shortcomings and mistakes of the past are endless. But if we can humbly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, abandon all selfish and self-serving old ideas, accept the leadership of the proletariat's ideology, have the courage to learn from the masses, actively carry out criticism and self-criticism, change our old attitudes, and eliminate our old styles, I think every one of our scientific workers has the potential to become a servant of the people and can exert our greatest strength to build a new China.

    批判我的旧思想
    中国科学院水生生物研究所所长  王家楫
    我是一个科学工作者，完全是从旧社会里教养出来的人，过去关在实验室里，自命“清高”。现在回过头来仔细检查一下，觉得以前所犯的错误，实在太多，差不多一般小资产阶级知识分子所容易犯的毛病，我没有一样没有犯过。下面就是我自己的例子，很愿意提出来讲讲，使得大家明了，像我这样的人，如果不把脑筋改换过来，是不配当人民的勤务员的。
    我生长在一个典型的封建家庭，自从进了初等小学，脑袋里就充满着向上爬的思想。在小学的时候，父亲曾经请了一位算命先生，这位先生将我的八字排好之后，恭恭敬敬地说：“这位小少爷的八字，是双飞蝴蝶格，格局高贵异常，一旦矢志攻书，定许名题雁塔。”父亲当然兴奋得不亦乐乎。那时我只有七八岁，站在旁边，也不禁笑逐颜开，说不尽的高兴。等到二十多岁大学毕业以后，出洋留学以前，暑假寒假回到家中，还要翻翻我的命书，引以为快。那时我已经是一个初入门径的生物学工作者，对于达尔文的学说，也有了一些认识，但还是很可怜地为这个“命运”的胡说所迷惑。在旧社会里，无疑地，我的思想意识里，只有一个个人的前途，时时把个人的利益放在第一位，否则决不会为这个“命运”的胡说所迷惑。到后来我还要讥笑比我爬得快、爬得高、或者一直爬到人民头上的人，说他们投机取巧，卑陋龌龊。但现在反过来想一想，当时自己也何尝不在爬的过程之中呢？不过爬的速率和方式，有一些不同而已。
    自从进了南京高等师范，我就没有用过老家一文钱。那时我自己觉得很满意，以为可以对得起老家。不知道老家的钱，都是从农民身上剥削得来的；在高等师范所吃的白饭，出洋留学四年，用江苏省官费四五千美金，也同样是人民的血汗。总之我一生都是用人民的血汗来念书的。等到留学回来，虽然在中央大学教了五年书，但所教的学生，都是地主、资产阶级和小资产阶级的子弟，没有教过一个工农的子弟。虽然也做过一些研究工作，但都是在自己一个很小的范围内兜圈子，并无计划性。心血来潮，今天愿意做变形虫，就做变形虫；明天愿意干纤毛虫，就干纤毛虫。不去问问做出来、干出来的东西，究竟对人民有什么利益？一直到解放为止，将近三十个年头，我的工作差不多都是脱离实际的，我的作风是一贯自由散漫的。当时我所专门研究的一个范围——原生动物学，在国内没有第二个人的资格比我还老，而且很享盛名。今年在国内多发表几篇论文，可以提高我一些地位；明年在外国杂志上再发表几篇论文，更可以大大地提高我的地位。人家恭维我，我表面上虽则谦虚，心里头着实好过。大有“而今中国的原生动物学舍我其谁哉”的感觉。那时我也希望把我的工作搞好，但希望的目的是：工作搞得愈好，我在科学界中的地位，可以站得愈稳，还可以倚老卖老，巩固自己的地位。为人民服务的口号，是到解放以后才听到的。
    过去的中央大学，是南京高等师范、东南大学发展改变而成，因此后来中央大学的一个小集团，旁人就称之谓“南高东大”集团。这个小集团充满着陈旧崇古的保守性和宗派主义的狭隘性。我是从这个小集团内很早孵化出来的产物，小集团的一般思想情况，也就大大地影响了我的思想情况。五四运动刚才开始的时候，北京大学提倡做白话文，南京高等师范起而反对。当时南京高等师范所出的“论衡”，就是反对白话文的工具。我虽没有在“论衡”上发表过文章，但也是口口声声反对白话文的一人。等到我女儿上学之后，读书不到两年，就会提起笔来写信，我才不反对了。不反对的原因，也只是为我子女容易读书起见，自己还醉心于古文。有时写科学的文章，还想套袭桐城派的章句。从未自己问一问，这种文章写出来，广大的群众是否能看得懂呢？当抗日战争期间我在四川北碚的时候，至少有两三年为了做好古诗费了我大部分的时间；业务工作，做得很少。我自己“陶冶了我的性灵”，但前方后方的劳动人民，天天在被日本帝国主义和反动政府蹂躏践踏之中，他们的性灵是什么样呢？相形之下，如何对得起人民呢？
    中央大学从开始到抗日战争末期，历任的校长如朱家骅、罗家伦、顾孟余等，都自北京大学出身，或者是和北京大学很有关系的人。“南高东大”的集团，始终是满肚子里不高兴。不高兴的原因，并非因为这些人都是反革命的头目，否则像蒋匪介石也居然一度做过校长，为什么并没有人出而反对呢？不高兴的原因，主要的还是一个宗派观念。中央大学的架子是摆得很大的，但高高在这个大架子上面的人，并非自己集团出身的人，而且换来换去，还是一个“老冤家”，感到不成体统。面子上既不好看，心里头更不舒服。一方面朱家骅等做校长的时候，对于全校师生，有很多压迫的地方；但另一方面，这个小集团也在一院之内，一系之中，尽量酝酿着“南高、东大、中大”清一色的把戏。自己的学生尽管糟得很，癞痢头儿子亲生的，终是要另眼看待。我到中央研究院以后，添聘年轻的人，有时多聘了别的大学毕业的学生，少聘了或者不去聘中央大学毕业的学生，就要受严重的批评，说我没有照顾到母校母系，忘怀了自己的根本发祥之地。有时要添聘年纪较大、能领导研究的人，如果和集团中人商议，说来说去，被推荐的终不外乎是自己的同学。这一个集团特别把北京大学一个集团中的傅斯年、汪敬熙当作敌人，眼光很不差，这两人不但是过去学术界的恶霸，而且已经先后走上了反革命的道路。但在自己阵容里面，也有反革命分子如张其昀其人者。解放后不久，中央大学改名南京大学，有好些人感觉得很不自然，人民政府为什么不把中央大学改成原来的东南大学呢？很明显，这完全由于宗派主义的传统思想还在作祟。
    现在新中国所有的大学，不论什么名称，都应该由人民掌握的了，不能为一个小集团所支配了。我们必须打破宗派观念，放弃小集团，站到全心全意为人民服务的一个伟大的立场上。
    从前我是不习惯于集体的生活，怕组织，怕纪律。我所欢喜的是单独的生活和单独的工作环境。同群众是非常隔膜的。一九三四年进了中央研究院，真是适合我的胃口。直到解放为止，整整有十五个年头，做了反动政府当点缀用的一只花瓶，更看不见群众的力量。群众对于我呢？不要说反动政府“翰林院”内的花瓶，就是一个大户人家的花瓶，安安稳稳放在客厅里面，劳动人民也是难以看见的，即使偶尔看到，望也不敢多望一望，还敢去亲近他用手摸一摸么？我还记得当蒋匪介石要做总统的时候，伪政府进行了改组，以朱家骅、傅斯年为首的中央研究院，争取了直接隶属于伪总统府的机会，于是花瓶声价，更增高了百倍。全院的人，十之八九，也都引以为喜。我又记得在一九四九年上海解放以后，前中央研究院的朋友们开了好几次会，讨论关于新中国的科学院应该如何组织，有好些人对于所谓隶属问题，还想考虑，希望要隶属得高一些。但现在的主要问题，不在乎隶属的高低，而在乎要我们每一个人，必须建立新的立场、新的观点和新的方法，使学术研究，和广大人民的实际需要密切相配合。隶属得高，隶属得低，都一样地要全心全意为人民服务。人民政府决不再把我们当作花瓶用了。我们应该尽量发挥我们的力量了。
    本位主义和关门主义，是过去中央研究院一贯的作风。一个所长经费争得愈多，表示他的行政权威愈高，一个研究员图书、仪器买得愈多，表示他的研究能力愈大。大家只管扩充自己的地盘，地盘大了，可以夸耀于人。那里有闲工夫照顾整个院的全面，更没有闲工夫照顾人民有没有痛苦。认为自己的工作终要比人家的工作高出一层；自己训练出来的人终要比人家训练出来的好得多。表面上虽然互不得罪，但背后头彼此常说坏话。研究员和研究员之间，所和所之间，时常存在着不少的隔阂。特别是各所之间，大家很少来往，仪器药品也难得借用一下，整个的象牙塔，当然也关得紧紧的了。内部尚且如此，对外更谈不上有联系。而且自高自大的态度，人家望见了还要退避三舍，如何敢来亲近我呢？过去人家骂中央研究院关门主义，我终是以为与我无关，被骂的不是傅斯年，就是汪敬熙。等到一九五○年中国科学院举行第一次院务会议的时候，各所的任务和工作计划，都在小组会议上请院外专家及产业部门的代表提供意见，加以批评，真是见所未见，我方才觉得自己在从前也犯过关门主义的错误。
    解放以后，我忽然听到了“买办的科学家”这个名称，我觉得很奇怪，科学家为什么会变成买办呢？后来分析分析，过去即在中央研究院中，就有不少科学家的确有买办的思想和作风。最特出的是汪敬熙。他对于中国国内研究科学的人，没有一个瞧得起的。在他周围的同事，都不在他的眼中。少不如意，还要大发雷霆，肆口谩骂。但是对于美国英国以及其他帝国主义国家的科学家，恭而敬之，态度完全两样。在他脑筋里面，在中国只有他是可以配得上做科学家的，其他真正的科学家，都生长在美英帝国主义国家，中国是没有资格生得出来的。只有美英帝国主义国家的人做的工作，可以做得比他还好，其他的中国人，如何能及得来他。这种行径和想法，还不像洋行里的买办么？中央研究院历任的总干事，我所最佩服的有两人：一是丁文江，一是萨本栋。这两人脑袋里也是充满着买办的思想。无论什么东西，说来说去，终是美英帝国主义国家的要比中国的好。二人对于我觉得样样都不差，只有一样他们认为美中不足，就是我的英文说起来不很流利；写起来也不十分高明。但是我在当时写研究论文，篇篇都是用英文写的。嘴里头说，用英文写因为要和国外科学家交换；心里头实在另有一种想法，用中文来写，恐怕要降低我的论文的价值。丁、萨两人后在中央研究院所执行的英美式的政策，当时我都非常拥护，他们做了中国科学的大买办；我也做过中国科学的小买办，自己还不觉得呢！在反动政府时代，中央研究院每逢举行评议会，假如没有胡适之来出席，就觉得扫兴。谁能够同胡适之多握几秒钟手，多谈几分钟话，就会觉得体面，人家看见了还要眼红。而胡适之和蒋匪介石一样，同是美帝国主义的臣妾呢！
    一九四九年的年底，中国科学院把以前中央研究院、北平研究院等机构重新调整的时候，我的情绪闹了许久，经过了许多剧烈的思想斗争。当时大家所犯的毛病，不外乎两个：一个是不肯放弃小圈子，
    一个是不肯改变自己的兴趣。小圈子就是小集团，现在不能再存在，必须打破。个人的兴趣，当然很重要，对于自己所做的工作，不感兴趣，做起来就很难做得好。但是人民的需要，比较个人的兴趣，尤其重要。如果真正能够站在人民的立场，向群众学习，彻底了解目前国家的迫切需要，我想新的兴趣，也会产生出来。自己也会不知不觉地愿意改变原来的工作方向，以配合目前国家所迫切需要的工作。我们必须了解中国已经到了一个空前伟大的新时代，一切的一切，都属于人民。科学不能例外，当然也属于人民。因此我们工作的出发点，也是无条件地为了人民，为人民解决问题，为人民谋福利。我们不能再效法为资产阶级服务的英美式的科学家了。我们不能再强调个人的兴趣了。我们必须向苏联科学家学习，效法他们为广大人民服务的精神和方法。
    过去的缺点和错误，是说不尽的。但我们如果能够虚心学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，抛弃一切自私自利的旧思想，接受无产阶级思想的领导，有勇气向群众学习，积极开展批评和自我批评，改变旧的态度，革除旧的作风，我想我们每一个科学工作者，都有可能成为人民的一个勤务员，都能够为建设新中国而发挥我们最大的力量。
