    Lushan County Labor Model Su Dianxuan Mutual Aid Team
    Leads the Masses in Formulating Production Increase and Thrift Plans
    I had the honor of participating in the National Day celebration for the second anniversary of the founding of New China in the capital, attended the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and also visited factories and farms. I also listened to reports from various leaders.
    When I returned to Lushan, Henan, more than three thousand people greeted me and surrounded me. I conveyed to them Chairman Mao's speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC and the state of Chairman Mao's health. They cheered with joy and shouted slogans. After returning home, I successively participated in the Shishi District's meeting to send off Huai River workers, the Chengguan District mass meeting, and the county-wide expanded cadre meeting, and conveyed Chairman Mao's call for "increasing production and practicing thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." I will continue to convey this message in the future.
    The mutual aid team I lead unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call. The team has now revised its patriotic production plan for this winter: 1. Agriculture: Wheat fields should be weeded once before the lunar New Year, and two carts of fertilizer should be applied per mu. Spring land (land prepared for planting tobacco, cotton, and ginger next year) should be plowed twice and harrowed four times before the end of the year, and ginger land should be dug once, while ensuring the accumulation of 150 carts of fertilizer. 2. Sideline Occupations: The existing flour mill should grind 30 jin more of beans per day, and the tofu shop should make one more batch. A shed for carts should also be built. 3. Cultural Learning: All team members should participate in people's schools. Our team consists of ten households, and we have held family meetings to implement Chairman Mao's call for thrift by carefully calculating accounts. Everyone decided to set aside a portion of their income from increased production and thrift this winter to continue donating airplanes and cannons for resisting America and aiding Korea. My whole family guarantees to save one jin of grain per day and donate 100 jin of grain by the end of the year; the other nine households guarantee to save and donate 100,000 yuan. Everyone also decided that the team's flour mill will donate 100,000 yuan for each batch of pigs raised. Under the leadership of our team, the thrift movement is flourishing throughout the township. Currently, thirteen mutual aid teams have formulated production increase, thrift, and donation plans for this winter, just like our team.

    鲁山县劳动模范苏殿选互助组
    带领群众订出增产节约计划
    我在首都光荣地参加了新中国成立二周年的国庆典礼，列席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，还参观了工厂、农场，又听了各首长的报告。
    我回到了河南鲁山，有三千多个群众迎接我并围住了我，我向他们传达了毛主席在政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的讲话，和毛主席的健康情况，他们高兴得高呼口号。回到家后，我连续参加了释寺区欢送治淮民工大会、城关区群众大会、全县扩大干部会议等，先后传达了毛主席关于“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，今后我还要继续传达。
    我领导的互助组，大家一致表示要坚决响应毛主席的号召。现在组内已修订了今冬爱国生产计划：一、农业：麦地在夏历年内要普遍锄草一次，每亩地再施肥二车，春地（准备明年种烟、棉、姜的地）在年内要犁二耙四，姜地刨一遍，并保证积肥一百五十车。二、副业：原有粉坊一座，每天要多磨三十斤豆，豆腐坊一座要多做一作；并盖车棚一所。三、文化学习：要做到全组参加民校。俺组共十户，已开了家庭会，用算细账的办法，把毛主席的节约号召贯彻到了各家。大家决定今冬在增产节约中要抽出一部分收入继续捐献飞机大炮、抗美援朝。我全家保证每天节约一斤粮，到年底捐献一百斤粮食；其他九户保证节约捐献十万元。大家又决定组内的粉坊每养一批猪即捐献十万元。在俺组带领下，全乡节约运动正在蓬勃展开，目前已有十三个互助组和俺组一样订出了今冬增产节约捐献计划。
