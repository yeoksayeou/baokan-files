    CCP Central Committee East China Bureau Issues
    Instructions on Rural Work Tasks After Land Reform

    I.
    After the completion of land reform, the central tasks of rural work are to enhance agricultural production, raise the political consciousness of peasants, and strengthen democratic governance on the basis of continuing to expand and deepen the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, so as to consolidate the victory of land reform and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

    II.
    After peasants have been allocated land, they have been freed from feudal bondage and have the possibility of developing production in a free hand, but some peasants have developed concerns about "standing out," which hinders the unleashing of production enthusiasm. Therefore, all localities should widely and deeply publicize the Ten Policies for Developing Agricultural Production and earnestly implement them, so that peasants clearly understand that the People's Government resolutely protects the economic interests of peasants, the land and property originally owned by peasants and allocated in the land reform, and the labor income and other legitimate gains of peasants, and that no one is allowed to infringe upon them.

    At present, in order to effectively eliminate the concerns of peasants, mobilize peasants to actively engage in production, and strengthen patriotic education among peasants, it is necessary to combine the slogan of "getting rich through labor" with the slogan of "increasing production for patriotism." Peasants should understand that being able to engage in labor production under conditions of freedom and equality today is the result of national liberation, the victory of land reform, and the abolition of feudal bondage; at the same time, peasants should understand that in the future, it is necessary to actively defend the motherland and consolidate and develop the people's victory, so that getting rich through labor will be guaranteed. The idea of only caring about personal labor to get rich without considering the interests of the country is wrong and incorrect.

    Because land reform only abolished feudal land ownership and did not abolish capitalist private property, and to some extent cleared the way for the development of capitalism, the existence and certain degree of development of the rich peasant economy is unavoidable in the stage of new democracy. At the same time, because the people's power of New China is under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and the people's power controls the economic lifeline of the country, the existence and certain degree of development of the rich peasant economy is not to be feared. Therefore, the policy adopted by our Party today of allowing the existence of the rich peasant economy is correct.

    However, our Party does not allow the rural economy to develop spontaneously along the old capitalist road. The direction of our Party's leadership and promotion of the rural economy today is the direction indicated by Chairman Mao: the direction of "organizing," the direction of "gradually moving from individual to collective," and the direction of helping peasants "gradually organize themselves into agricultural production cooperatives and other cooperatives on the principle of voluntariness," which is "the only way to change from poverty to wealth." Therefore, on the one hand, resolutely protect and encourage the productive enthusiasm of peasants, and on the other hand, patiently educate and guide peasants to organize themselves and gradually lead them to the road of cooperative development. This is the starting point of our Party's rural policy in the stage of new democracy.

    III.
    Party committees at all levels should actively organize and lead the patriotic production increase movement of the broad masses, starting from the actual conditions of the locality, to ensure the increase in production of grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods, and strive to approach, reach, or exceed the pre-war level of agricultural production. In addition to requiring better completion of this year's agricultural production tasks, full preparations should be made this autumn and winter for the major agricultural production movement next year, and strive for a bumper harvest in 1952. To achieve this goal, the following specific measures must be taken:

    First, all work in rural areas must take into account the production season, not miss the farming season, and ensure that not a single acre of land is left uncultivated. In organizing and leading agricultural production, it is necessary to first help the poor and landless peasants who have obtained land in the land reform, while closely uniting the middle peasants and earnestly protecting the interests of the middle peasants; it is necessary to earnestly help the families of martyrs and soldiers with cultivation on their behalf and find ways to solve the labor difficulties of poor workers' families, and ensure that widowers, widows, orphans, and the disabled are able to cultivate in a timely manner; it is necessary to urge landlords and idlers to actively engage in production; the rich peasants should also be well educated to reassure them in production; for the difficulties of poor peasants in obtaining seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, draught animals, and rations after the land distribution, solutions should be sought from encouraging peasants to save on their own, promoting free lending, and using government loans.

    Second, strengthen production guidance in economic crop areas. Ensure the production of economic crops such as cotton, flax, tobacco, tea, and silk, as well as commodity grains such as rice, wheat, and soybeans. The central government's policy of rewarding the production of major industrial raw material crops must be resolutely implemented, ensuring reasonable parity, simplifying procurement procedures, ensuring procurement and marketing, implementing price grading, and prohibiting downgrading for procurement. Trade companies and cooperatives should promptly supply the daily necessities and means of production needed by peasants in these areas. Leadership at all levels should provide different guidance to different crop areas. In areas where people make a living by engaging in forestry, fishery, and salt industry, the local Party and People's Government should also focus their guidance on this.

    Third, strengthen technical guidance in agricultural production. For example, guiding peasants to improve farm tools, develop water conservancy, select and breed good varieties, cultivate intensively and meticulously, accumulate and apply fertilizer, develop animal husbandry, prevent and control animal epidemics and pests, and protect and cultivate forests. In particular, leading peasants to fight against natural disasters such as water, drought, insects, and diseases, and planned supply of fertilizers, farm tools, and pesticides, summarizing and promoting the experience of peasants in increasing production, are the basic links to improve agriculture and achieve increased production. Various agricultural exhibitions of different scales should be encouraged. Rewarding labor models and organizing production competitions should be promoted according to the situation. Local farms should maintain regular contact with local labor models and labor mutual aid groups to help them summarize experience and improve agricultural science knowledge.

    Fourth, water conservancy must be planned and vigorously carried out, and flood control and irrigation work must be vigorously carried out. Rivers that are frequently affected by disasters and areas that are prone to waterlogging after rain should continue to be governed to gradually eliminate floods. In areas where water sources are available, irrigation should be vigorously developed, and wells and ponds should be dug extensively to prevent drought. Dikes, dams, and other projects should be effectively protected to prevent damage.

    Fifth, great importance should be attached to the promotion of local products, regular local product conferences should be held, and methods such as vigorously purchasing and selling through cooperatives, trade companies, and state-owned stores, and encouraging private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase and sell should be adopted to promote local products.

    Sixth, in order to meet the needs of rural people for daily necessities, production tools, and agricultural product processing, various handicrafts should be restored, developed, and transformed in a planned and guided manner, with special attention to supporting ironworkers, carpenters, and bamboo workers who manufacture farm tools, and planned guidance should be given to sideline production by peasants.

    Seventh, in order to implement the central government's instructions on land survey and production determination work, and to encourage peasants' production enthusiasm, old areas should complete fixed output within one or two years, and new areas should strive to initially verify acreage and determine output within one year, and strive to fix output within two or three years to ensure the implementation of the rational burden policy.

    Eighth, provincial and county bank work should focus its main efforts on developing rural finance, developing rural credit business, helping peasants solve funding difficulties in all aspects, promoting agricultural production, and vigorously assisting the development of cooperative undertakings.

    IV.
    The principles of Chairman Mao's instructions on "cooperatives" and "organizing" must be resolutely implemented, labor mutual aid groups should be universally organized, and various cooperative organizations with the task of promoting local products should be established. Organizing labor mutual aid and developing cooperatives is the basic way to develop rural productivity, improve labor efficiency, and enrich the broad masses of peasants under today's conditions. However, the organization of peasants today is still based on individual private economy, so it does not negate or limit peasants' private property, but protects peasants' private property in order to encourage their active labor production. The practice of forced orders that deviate from the masses is incorrect and dangerous. At the same time, it must be recognized that the organization of peasants today is also preparing conditions for future agricultural collectivization in terms of developing production and enabling peasants to recognize the superiority of collective labor. Therefore, it is also incorrect and wrong to adopt a passive and waiting attitude towards mutual aid and cooperation undertakings. We must "cautiously, gradually, and actively lead peasants to organize themselves," opposing any hasty methods that deviate from the masses and preventing the waiting view of allowing things to drift. In order to implement and realize the direction of organizing, the following work must be carried out:

    First, labor mutual aid groups should be universally organized according to local conditions, production needs, and mass habits, in a step-by-step manner and in accordance with the principles of voluntary combination, equivalent exchange, and democratic management. The basic methods of organizing mutual aid and cooperation are "patient persuasion" and "typical demonstration," and forced orders are absolutely not allowed. It is necessary to create examples of increased production in mutual aid to influence peasants, so that peasants understand that mutual aid can increase production better and more than working alone, and can enable everyone participating in the labor mutual aid group to become rich faster. The development process of mutual aid groups should be from small to large, from low-level to high-level, and from temporary to fixed. It should start with the main labor mutual aid during the busy farming season, and gradually combine it with overcoming natural disasters, developing sideline occupations, improving production technology, and preparing for the busy farming season during the slack farming season, so as to gradually overcome the seasonal restrictions of rural production mutual aid and gradually consolidate and expand the mutual aid groups into long-term and fixed organizations. In areas where mutual aid movement has a foundation, the masses have rich mutual aid experience, and there are relatively strong leading backbones, agricultural production cooperatives should be established under leadership and with emphasis on the basis of the masses' voluntary participation.

    Second, cooperative organizations at all levels with the task of promoting local products as the central task should be established. In new areas, cooperatives should continue to focus on economic crop areas and develop forward in an organized manner. The cooperatives in the old areas should be reorganized and improved with emphasis. The existing cooperatives in general agricultural areas should continue to be reorganized and developed. Efforts should be made to ensure that most or all of the important industrial raw materials and export goods are purchased through cooperatives and directly handed over to the state. Cooperatives should pay special attention to serving the entire process of agricultural production, providing members with the means of production they need and promoting local products, actively organizing trust deposit and lending businesses, and conducting typical experiments in establishing handicraft production cooperatives. The following principles must be implemented for the construction of grass-roots societies: serving the masses wholeheartedly; freedom of joining and withdrawing from the society; implementing democratic management and improving the leadership of the Party. Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over cooperatives and earnestly help them solve various difficulties.

    Third, rural Party members should be educated to actively and selflessly lead peasants to work hard in production, and play an exemplary role in organizing labor mutual aid and developing cooperative undertakings. All rural Party members should understand that not taking the old road of exploiting others in the old society, but taking the new road of organizing labor mutual aid groups and organizing cooperatives can not only better improve production, so that themselves and everyone can become rich faster, but also can avoid adopting the method of hiring workers to exploit others, so as to maintain the purity of Communist Party members. If individual Party members want to continue to work alone, they should not be forced to participate in mutual aid organizations; if individual Party members have surplus funds, they should be guided to add and improve farm tools to improve agricultural production; if individual Party members want to hire workers, they should be persuaded to participate in labor mutual aid groups to solve the difficulties of labor shortage. They should be told that as a people, the government allows him to hire workers, but as a Communist Party member, if he exploits hired workers and turns himself into a direct exploiter, it is a violation of the principles of the Party. As for individual Party members in the old areas whose farmer composition has risen and who have become new rich peasants after land reform due to rising labor production, they should be dealt with in accordance with the principles stipulated by the Organization Department of the Central Committee and according to the specific situation.

    Fourth, in order to educate peasants and make them understand the superiority of collective management and advanced technology, state-owned demonstration farms of different scales should be established in each province (region), each special region, and each county. Provinces (regions), special regions, and counties should also strengthen their leadership over existing farms with the nature of technology promotion.

    V.
    In order to adapt to the rapidly growing cultural demands of the peasant masses after land reform, rural cultural and educational work should be systematically carried out with patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and promoting agricultural science knowledge and gradually eliminating illiteracy as the center. Guidance should be strengthened for existing people's schools, literacy classes, blackboards, and rural theater troupes in various places. Winter school textbooks should be compiled and winter school teachers trained in advance in various places, so as to universally launch the winter school movement this winter. Primary schools in various districts and townships, and county middle schools should plan to enroll children of workers and peasants. The educational policy of agricultural schools should be combined with the actual needs of developing agricultural production at present. Training courses for labor models should be planned to be held during the slack farming season to facilitate the dissemination of production experience and the promotion of agricultural science knowledge. Rural health work should be gradually promoted, and health education for disease prevention should be carried out among the masses. For serious regional diseases and acute infectious diseases in rural areas, Western medicine should be guided, Chinese medicine should be united, and medical teams should be organized to carry out prevention and treatment. Health centers at the district level and medical cooperative societies should be planned to be established to gradually solve the difficulties of the masses in disease prevention and drug supply.

    VI.
    Democratic governance work should be planned and carried out. In order to facilitate the People's Government to contact the masses and the people to manage political power, districts and townships should be divided into smaller units in various places during the autumn and winter agricultural gaps. County people's representative conferences and district and township people's representative conferences based on farmer representative conferences should be held regularly to make them a regular system. A large number of farmer cadres should be absorbed to participate in government work, and the People's Government committees at the county, district, and township levels should be improved. Township People's Governments should especially widely absorb farmer cadres to participate in the work of various regular and temporary special committees. The People's Government committees in districts and townships should be re-elected regularly, and work reports should be made to the people regularly in order to accept the people's criticism and carry out self-criticism, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. Attention should be paid to reorganizing and developing the militia, and strengthening the work of mass organizations such as farmers' associations, youth, and women to consolidate the mass base of the people's democratic dictatorship.

    VII.
    District and township cadres and the broad masses of peasant activists who have emerged in the land reform movement should be trained in a planned manner, and grass-roots leadership backbones in rural areas should be cultivated and united in a planned manner. Communist and Communist Party education should be widely conducted among peasant activists, and then those who meet the conditions for Party membership should be systematically examined and absorbed into the Party to establish rural Party branches in the new areas. In areas where there are already Party branches, Party rectification work should be carried out in accordance with the decision of the Central Committee.

    VIII.
    All areas where land reform has not yet been completed should continue to carry out land reform in accordance with the planned plan, so as to fully shift to developing agricultural production after the end of land reform.

    IX.
    After the completion of land reform, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and develop rural work, so the leadership of Party committees at all levels over rural work should not be weakened, and the existing rural work cadres should be gradually transferred after local cadres have been trained and can replace the work, so as to avoid disconnection. The agricultural committees of Party committees at all levels above the prefectural committee should be strengthened so that the Party committee can take into account rural work while strengthening the leadership of urban work.

    中共中央华东局发布
    关于土地改革后农村工作任务的指示
    一
    土地改革完成后，农村工作的中心任务，是在继续扩大和深入抗美援朝保家卫国运动的基础上，提高农业生产，提高农民政治觉悟，加强民主建政，以巩固土地改革的胜利，巩固人民民主专政。二    农民在分得土地之后，摆脱了封建束缚，有了放手发展生产的可能，但在部分农民中曾产生怕“冒尖”的顾虑，阻碍着生产积极性的发挥。因此，各地应广泛深入宣传发展农业生产的十大政策，并切实予以贯彻，使农民明确认识人民政府对于农民的经济利益，对于农民原有的及在土地改革中分得的土地财产，对于农民的劳动所得及其他合法利得是坚决保护的，是不容许任何人侵犯的。
    目前在农村中为了有效地消除农民的顾虑，动员农民积极生产，并加强农民中的爱国主义教育，必须将“劳动发家”的口号与“爱国增产”的口号结合起来。应使农民了解：今天能够在自由平等的条件下进行劳动生产，是全国解放、土地改革胜利及取消了封建束缚的结果；同时，应使农民了解：今后必须积极保卫祖国和巩固发展人民的胜利，劳动发家才有保障，那种只顾个人劳动发家而不顾国家利益的思想是错误的、不正确的。
    因为土地改革只是废除了封建的土地所有制，并未废除资本主义的私有财产，并在某种范围内还为资本主义的发展扫除了障碍，因此，在新民主主义阶段，富农经济的存在和一定程度的发展是不可免的。同时，因为新中国的人民政权是在工人阶级和共产党的领导之下，人民政权掌握了国家的经济命脉，因此，富农经济的存在和一定程度的发展也是不可怕的。所以今天我党采取允许富农经济存在的政策是正确的。
    但我党不是听任农村经济随着老的资本主义道路去自流发展。我党今天对农村经济的领导和提倡的方向，乃是毛主席所指示的：“组织起来”的方向，是“由个体逐步走向集体”的方向，是帮助农民“在自愿原则下，逐渐地组织在农业生产合作社及其他合作社之中”的方向，这乃是“由穷变富的必由之路”。因此，一方面，坚决保护和鼓励农民的生产积极性，另一方面，又耐心地教育和引导农民组织起来，逐步地引向合作社方向发展的道路，这就是新民主主义阶段我党农村政策的出发点。三    各级党委应从当地实情出发积极组织和领导广大群众的爱国增产运动，保证粮食、工业原料以及外销物资的增产，力求接近、或达到、或超过战前农业生产水平，除要求更好地完成今年的农业生产任务外，应利用今年秋、冬两季充分完成有关明年农业大生产运动的一切准备，为争取一九五二年的丰收而奋斗。为达到此目的，必须采取下列各种具体措施：
    第一、农村中一切工作都必须照顾生产季节，不误农时，作到不荒一亩地。在组织和领导农业生产中，必须首先帮助在土地改革中获得土地的贫雇农，同时要紧密地团结中农，切实保护中农的利益；必须切实帮助烈、军属代耕及设法替贫苦工属解决劳力困难，并使鳏、寡、孤、独户能够适时耕种；必须督促地主、二流子积极生产；对于富农也应很好地教育他们，使他安心生产；对于贫苦农民在分得土地后关于种籽、肥料、农具、耕畜、口粮等困难，应从鼓励农民自身节约、提倡自由借贷及运用政府贷款等方法中去求得解决。
    第二、加强经济作物区的生产指导。保证棉、麻、烟、茶、丝等经济作物及稻谷、小麦、大豆等商品粮食的生产。应坚决贯彻中央奖励主要工业原料作物生产的政策，保证合理比价，简化收购手续，保证收购和运销，实行按级给价，禁止压低等级收购。贸易公司和合作社应及时供应这些地区农民所需的生活资料及生产资料。各级领导机关对不同作物地区应进行不同指导。凡人民以经营林业、渔业、盐业为生的地区，当地党与人民政府也应以此为主进行指导。
    第三、加强农业生产的技术指导。例如领导农民改进农具、发展水利、选育良种、精耕细作、积肥施肥、发展牧畜、防除畜疫与病虫害、护林育林，特别是领导农民与水、旱、虫、病等自然灾害作斗争，有计划地供应肥料，农具和防治病虫害的药械，总结与推广农民增产的经验，则是改进农业达到增产的基本环节。各种不同规模的农业展览会应提倡举办。奖励劳动模范及组织生产竞赛应据情推广。各地农场应与当地劳动模范、劳动互助组进行经常联系，帮助他们总结经验，提高农业科学知识。
    第四、必须有计划地兴修水利，大力进行防洪与灌溉工作。对屡为灾害的河流及雨后易成涝灾的地区，应继续贯彻治理，以逐渐消灭水灾。对有水源可资利用的地区，应大力发展灌溉事业，普遍进行打井、挖塘，以防旱灾。对堤防闸坝等工程应加以切实保护，以防破坏。
    第五、应十分重视推销土产工作，定期召开土产会议，并采取通过合作社、贸易公司、国营商店大力购销及鼓励私商下乡购销等方法去推销土产。
    第六、为了满足农村人民的生活必需品、生产工具及农产品加工等等方面的需要，应有计划地、有领导地恢复、发展和改造各种手工业，特别应注意扶持制造农具的铁工、木工、竹工等手工业及有计划地指导农民副业生产等。
    第七、为了贯彻中央查田定产工作的指示，及鼓励农民的生产情绪起见，老区应在一、二年内完成固定产量，新区应争取在一年以内初步查实田亩订定产量，并争取在二、三年内固定其产量，保证合理负担政策的贯彻。
    第八、省、县银行工作应以主要力量开展农村金融工作，发展农村信贷业务，帮助农民从各方面解决资金困难，推进农业生产，并大力协助合作社事业的发展。四
    必须坚决贯彻毛主席“论合作社”、“组织起来”等指示的原则，普遍地组织劳动互助组，建立以推销土产为中心任务的各种合作社组织。组织劳动互助和发展合作社，是在今天条件下发展农村生产力，提高劳动效率，使广大农民富裕的基本办法。但今天农民的组织起来，还是以个体私有经济为基础的，因此不是否定和限制农民的私有财产，而是保护农民的私有财产，以便鼓励其积极劳动生产。那种强迫命令脱离群众的做法，是不正确的、危险的。同时又必须认识今天农民的组织起来，在发展生产并使农民认识集体劳动的优越性等方面又是为将来农业集体化准备条件的。因此对互助合作事业采取消极等待态度，也是不正确的、错误的。我们必须“谨慎地逐步地而又积极地领导农民组织起来”，既要反对任何脱离群众的急性办法，又要防止听任自流的等待观点。为了贯彻实现组织起来这个方向，必须进行下列工作：
    第一、应根据当地条件、生产需要、群众习惯，有步骤地按照自愿结合、等价交换、民主管理等原则，普遍地组织劳动互助组。组织互助合作的基本方法是“耐心说服”和“典型示范”，绝对不许强迫命令。要在互助中做出增产的实例去影响农民，使农民懂得互助比单干能更好更多地增加生产，能使一切参加劳动互助组的人更快地走向富裕。互助组的发展过程应是从小到大，从低级到高级，从临时性到固定性。应从农忙时主要劳动互助做起，并逐步结合战胜自然灾害，发展副业，提高生产技术，及利用农闲为农忙进行准备等，以逐渐克服农村生产互助的季节限制，使互助组逐步巩固扩大成为长期的固定的组织。在互助运动已有基础、群众已有丰富的互助经验、而又有比较坚强的领导骨干的地区，在群众自愿条件下，应有领导地、有重点地建立农业生产合作社。
    第二、应建立以推销土产为中心任务的各级合作社组织。新区合作社应继续以经济作物区为重点，有阵地地向前发展。对老区的合作社，应有重点地加以整理和提高。对一般农业区已有的合作社，应继续整理和发展。对重要工业原料及外销物资，力求大部以至全部经过合作社收购，直接交给国家。合作社应特别注意为农业生产的全过程服务，供给社员群众所需的生产资料及推销土产的工作，积极举办信托存实业务，并进行建立手工业生产合作社的典型试验。对基层社的建设，必须贯彻下列原则，即：全心全意为群众服务；入社退社自由自愿；实行民主管理及健全党的领导。各级党委必须加强对合作社的领导，并切实帮助其解决各种困难。
    第三、应教育农村中的党员，积极地、大公无私地领导农民努力生产，并在组织劳动互助和发展合作社的事业中起模范作用。应使农村全体党员了解：不走旧社会剥削他人的老路，而走组织劳动互助组和组织合作社的新路，这不但可以更好地提高生产，使自己和大家都能更快地富裕起来，而且也可以不要采取雇工剥削他人的办法，以保持共产党员的纯洁。如个别党员要继续单干，亦不应强迫他们参加互助组织；如个别党员有多余资金，应指导他们添置和改进农具，以提高农业生产；如个别党员要雇工，应说服他们参加劳动互助组，以解决劳动力不足的困难。应向他们说明：作为一个人民，政府是允许他雇工的，但作为一个共产党员，如果剥削雇工，把自己变成一个直接剥削者，则是违反党的原则的。至于在过去土地改革后因劳动生产上升而雇工成为新富农的个别老区农民成份的党员，应按照中央组织部规定的原则，根据具体情况处理。
    第四、为了教育农民，使其了解集体经营和进步技术的优越性，各省（区）、各专区、各县均应举办不同规模的国营示范农场。各省（区）、专区、县对现有的技术推广性质的农场亦应加强领导。五
    为适应土地改革后农民群众迅速增长的文化要求，应以抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，及提倡农业科学知识与逐步扫除文盲为中心，系统地展开农村文化教育工作。对各地现有的民校、识字班、黑板报及农村剧团等，应加强指导。各地应提早编订冬学教材，训练冬学师资，以便今冬普遍开展冬学运动。各地区、乡小学，县中学应有计划地吸收工农子弟入学。农业学校的教育方针应与当前发展农业生产的实际需要相结合。应利用农闲季节有计划地开办劳动模范训练班，以利传播生产经验，推广农业科学知识。应逐步推广农村的卫生工作，向群众进行预防疾病的卫生教育。对于农村中严重的地区性的疾病和急性传染病，应指导西医，团结中医，组织医疗队，进行预防和治疗。应有计划地建立区一级的卫生所和组织医药合作社，逐步解决群众对疾病的预防及药品供应的困难。六
    应有计划地进行民主建政工作。为便于人民政府联系群众及人民管理政权，各地应利用秋冬农隙，实行划小区、乡。应定期召开县人民代表会议和召开以农民代表会议为基础的区、乡的人民代表会议，使之成为经常制度。应吸收广大农民干部参加政权工作，并健全县、区、乡各级人民政府委员会，乡人民政府尤应广泛吸收农民干部参加各种经常的与临时的专门委员会的工作。应定期改选区、乡人民政府委员会，并定期向人民作工作报告，以便接受人民的批评和进行自我批评，改善干部与群众的关系。应注意整理和发展民兵，加强农民协会、青年和妇女等群众团体的工作，以巩固人民民主专政的群众基础。七
    应有计划地训练区、乡干部和土地改革运动中所涌现出来的广大农民积极分子，有计划地培养和团结农村基层领导骨干。对农民积极分子应广泛进行共产主义与共产党的教育，然后经过系统考查并吸收其中适合党员条件的分子入党，建立新区农村党的支部。在已有党的支部的地区，则应按照中央决定进行整党的工作。八
    一切尚未完成土地改革的地区，仍应依照预定计划继续进行土地改革，以便在结束土地改革后全面转向发展农业生产。九
    在土地改革完成后，必须继续巩固和发展农村工作，因此各地党委对农村工作的领导不应削弱，对现有农村工作干部应在当地干部已经培养出来并能代替工作后，采取陆续抽调办法，以免脱节。地委以上各级党委的农委应当加强，以便党委在加强城市工作领导时，同时能兼顾农村工作。中共中央华东局
