A Bright Banner

Li Xikui, a shunting worker at the Shenyang Station of the China Changchun Railway Administration, and his shunting team, have created advanced work experience in the process of promoting the new shunting method, improved work efficiency, and accumulated a large amount of wealth for the country. Therefore, at the National Railway Labor Model Representative Conference held in September this year, Li Xikui was recognized as the most outstanding shunting worker in the country, becoming a bright banner in the national railway shunting work.

Li Xikui and his shunting team not only increased their work efficiency by more than 60%, but also influenced and promoted other shunting teams at Shenyang Station, increasing their work efficiency by more than 50%. The time vehicles spent at Shenyang Station was significantly shortened. From May 1950 to August this year, a total of 187,052 vehicle-hours were saved. According to Shenyang Station's calculation, each vehicle-hour is equivalent to 47,000 yuan, totaling 87.9 billion yuan, equivalent to the value of 58 fighter jets. In the national railway workers' production increase and economy campaign, Li Xikui and his shunting team also proposed a specific plan to increase production and save 15 tons of grain per month.

The Old Shunting Method Lacked Coordination; the New
Shunting Method Has a High Degree of Planning and Organization

Shunting is one of the main links in railway transportation work. In order to transport goods from various places to various destinations, railways must carry out a large amount of complex shunting work at stations, compiling freight cars into complete trains and sending them to designated arrival stations. In the past, railway shunting work had long followed the old working method, in which a planning car number clerk made a plan for shunting work and handed it to the shunting worker to allocate vehicles. The planning car number clerk himself had limited ability and it was difficult to grasp the overall situation on the ground, so the shunting work plan was often not in line with the actual situation. The shunting worker could only mechanically execute the plan, and even if he found the plan to be wrong, he did not dare to change it without authorization. This formed the phenomenon of "the planning car number clerk being responsible but not handling, and the shunting worker working passively," which restricted the enthusiasm and creativity of the shunting workers, affecting the improvement of shunting work efficiency, so that trains at the station often could not be compiled in time and depart on schedule, and it was easy to cause accidents of vehicle congestion, affecting the full play of railway transport capacity. Since 1949, when the Northeast Railway learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promoted the "New Shunting Method," the old face of shunting work has been completely changed. The New Shunting Method implemented the spirit of the responsibility system, established a scientific organization and system in shunting work, canceled the planning car number clerk and the shunting work plan, and changed the station dispatcher to uniformly grasp the whole station's train compilation and decomposition plan; the shunting worker was responsible for organizing the shunting work and specifically realizing the train compilation and decomposition plan. This fully utilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the shunting workers, overcame the waste in shunting work, the late compilation of trains, and the phenomenon of vehicle congestion, and greatly improved the efficiency of shunting work.

In the process of promoting the New Shunting Method, Li Xikui, a shunting worker at Shenyang Station, not only led the station's shunting teams to implement the New Shunting Method, but also created a set of scientific work systems and methods in the practice of the New Shunting Method, which not only ensured the rapid progress of the work, but also ensured the safety of the work.

Cherish Every Second, Do a Good Job of Communication
and Coordination

Li Xikui's shunting team's advanced experience was accumulated through long-term efforts. Li Xikui's shunting team's work is very planned. They cherish every second, and they are good at grasping the situation. When they go to work every day, they record the work plan arranged by the duty stationmaster as the goal of their work, which is the so-called "work record system." They use the time on the way to the shunting yard to discuss the work plan and formulate specific measures to complete the plan, which is called the "walking meeting system." When passing through the shunting yard, they also separately understand the vehicle situation on the shunting yard lines, which is called the "line inspection system." After finishing work every day, they also use the walking time back from the shunting yard to hold a review meeting, summarize the work, and carry out criticism, which is called the "work completion review meeting." They seize time to do preparatory work and take the opportunity to understand the situation, thus reducing non-productive time and ensuring uninterrupted work.

Li Xikui's shunting team's division of labor is very clear, and each small matter is assigned to a specific person. The whole team, one shunting worker, four connecting workers, all carried out a specific division of labor according to their abilities and expertise. This is what they call the "division of labor responsibility system." When inspecting the lines after going to work every day, they also stipulate in advance who is in charge of which lines, responsible for understanding the destination of the vehicles, and which vehicles are restricted when compiling the train, which is the so-called "line-package system," "area-package system," and "restricted car-package system." Because the spirit of the responsibility system is truly implemented, not only is each matter grasped by a specific person, but also the work enthusiasm and creativity of each person is brought into play.

Li Xikui's shunting team's communication and coordination work is also done very well. Shunting work is a complex and complicated work, and it must be closely connected and coordinated with all relevant parties to ensure speed and safety. They have established systems with station dispatchers, drivers, reporters, and other relevant personnel, guaranteeing close cooperation with each other so that the work can proceed smoothly. These systems are called the "communication system." The communication system effectively guarantees that the personnel participating in the shunting work, under the unified leadership of the shunting worker, carry out the work in an orderly manner.

With the help of Soviet expert Engineer Kravitz at Shenyang Station, Li Xikui's shunting team adopted the Goryachev's working method, concentrated the advanced working methods of several excellent Soviet shunting workers, such as the "flexible line use method," "gravity shunting method," "continuous gravity shunting method," and "decomposition considering compilation," which constituted the Li Xikui shunting method. This shunting method solved many technical problems in shunting operations, thus greatly improving work efficiency.

Li Xikui's shunting team's work system and working methods are a set of scientific shunting work methods, and also a complete set of advanced work experience. It learns from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, concentrates advanced working methods, and has further creation and development in specific application, thus significantly improving the efficiency of shunting work, reducing waste in work, and accumulating a large amount of wealth for the country. This is a vivid and concrete example of the combination of the creativity of the Chinese working class and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

Li Xikui's Shunting Team's Advanced Experience
Was Promoted After Overcoming Various Conservative Ideas

Like other countless model figures, Li Xikui's shunting team created today's achievements after overcoming various conservative ideas. In August 1949, when the Shenyang Station Li Xikui shunting team was established, in addition to shunting worker Li Xikui who had worked as a connecting worker at this station, the other four connecting workers were newly transferred from other stations. At that time, Li Xikui was still a member of the Communist Youth League. Under the rule of Japanese devils and the Kuomintang, these five young workers who had suffered torment and pain deeply experienced the warmth and light that the Communist Party brought to them after liberation, and were very diligent in both work and study. Li Xikui often said to everyone: "When the Japanese devils left, they said: You Shenyang Station will not be managed well for thirty years. What about after liberation? There are fewer people, but we do more work than before. We workers are in charge, so we have strength. Our youth shunting team must work hard and study hard!" From the day Li Xikui's shunting team was established, the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union sent people to help them, improve their political, cultural, and professional level, and educate them to unite the masses, unite technical personnel, and humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Not long after the shunting team was established, Li Xikui gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Due to the influence of Li Xikui's active work, the work of the whole team became more energetic, and the study became more diligent. Half a year later, the four young people successively became members of the Communist Youth League.

In March 1950, the leaders of Shenyang Station called for a trial implementation of the New Shunting Method. Most of the workers in the station generally resisted the New Shunting Method in their thinking. They thought: "In the past, we worked according to the notification slip of the planning car number clerk, and we still made mistakes. This time, it will be a mess." "We have been doing this for so many years, how can there be mistakes?" "We have a low level of education, we can't do it!" Some workers also thought: "The New Shunting Method is both brain-intensive and labor-intensive, and we have to take responsibility for mistakes." Most of the middle-level cadres at the station also had no confidence: "See how you can do it!" At this time, all the workers of Li Xikui's shunting team, after discussion and research, automatically requested the leaders to try it out. Soviet expert Engineer Kravitz from the station personally came to teach them. More than a week later, Li Xikui's shunting team began to work independently using the New Shunting Method. At first, they were not skilled and very busy and confused, not only compiling trains slowly, but also often making mistakes and reworking. Sometimes the locomotive stopped on the side waiting. The longest time to compile a train was three hours. Four or five tenths of the trains that had already been compiled had to be reworked. The daily tasks were always not completed. In order to study ways to overcome difficulties, Li Xikui could not eat for more than ten days. At that time, a force supported him: "Communists have no difficulties that they cannot overcome!" He mobilized connecting worker Li Zhongxin and others to move their homes to Shenyang, live together, and use their time off to practice and concentrate on studying train compilation methods. They also took the initiative to request help from Chinese and Soviet engineers at the station to establish a division of labor responsibility system at work, and brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of all the workers in the team, so that the work of the whole team improved. They gradually overcame the phenomenon of being busy and confused, and began to be able to complete the daily tasks on time.

Under the influence of Li Xikui's shunting team, last year some workers and cadres began to change their past thinking that the New Shunting Method would not work, and were also willing to try it out themselves. The leaders of Shenyang Station decided to universally promote the New Shunting Method throughout the station from May. However, some old workers were still unconvinced, thinking: "What are these children? They will collapse in a few days!" Li Xikui and all the workers in the team, on the one hand, humbly united the surrounding masses and took the initiative to find old workers to ask for advice, solicit their opinions, and learn from their strengths in their off-duty time; on the other hand, they continued to study shunting work. Through continuous discussions in the group, they also established some work systems and learned several advanced working methods, so that the efficiency of shunting work continued to improve. In this way, the views of the old workers gradually changed, and many shunting teams began to adopt the work experience of Li Xikui's shunting team.

At the end of November 1950, the Shenyang Station Trade Union called on the whole station to learn from Li Xikui's working methods. But because some workers at that time still felt that "it's about the same, nothing special," the new working method was not widely promoted in time. In March of this year, Shenyang Station summarized Li Xikui's advanced experience, and the trade union organized a short-term training class, where Li Xikui reported and demonstrated. Through practical work, all the workers in the station further realized the superiority of Li Xikui's shunting team's work experience. From this time on, the Li Xikui shunting method was widely promoted not only in Shenyang Station, but also within the jurisdiction of the China Changchun Railway Administration.

In order to further improve the national railway shunting work and ensure the completion of the national transportation tasks, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government issued instructions in August this year to comprehensively promote the advanced work experience of Li Xikui's shunting team. At present, Li Xikui and his shunting team have become a bright banner among more than 500,000 railway workers across the country. Under the call of this banner, railway workers across the country will more humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, create new working methods, and accumulate wealth for the country.

    李锡奎调车组的先进经验
    吴风
    一面鲜明的旗帜
    中国长春铁路管理局沈阳站调车员李锡奎和他的调车组，在推行新调车法过程中，创造了先进的工作经验，提高了工作效率，为国家积累了大量财富。因此，在今年九月所召开的全国铁路劳动模范代表大会上，李锡奎被公认为全国最优秀的调车工作者，成为全国铁路调车工作中一面鲜明的旗帜。
    李锡奎和他的调车组，不仅把自己的工作效率提高了百分之六十以上，而且影响和推动沈阳站其他调车组，把工作效率提高了百分之五十以上。车辆在沈阳站停留的时间，显著地缩短了。从一九五○年五月到今年八月止，共计节约了十八万七千零五十二车小时。按照沈阳站计算，每车小时折合四万七千元，共计节约了八百七十九亿元，相当于五十八架战斗机的价值。在全国铁路职工的增产节约运动中，李锡奎和他的调车组又提出了每月增产节约十五吨粮食的具体计划。
    旧调车法工作脱节，新调车
    法有高度计划性与组织性
    调车是铁路运输工作中的主要环节之一。铁路为着将各地货物运输到各个不同的目的地，必须在车站进行大量而复杂的调车工作。将货车编成整列列车，开到指定的到达站。过去铁路调车工作，长期沿用着旧的工作方法，由计划车号员作出调车工作的计划，交调车员调配车辆。计划车号员本身能力有限，而且很难掌握现场全面情况，调车工作计划常常不切合实际情况。调车员只能机械执行计划，虽然发现计划不对，也不敢擅自改变。这就形成了“计划车号员包而不办，调车员消极工作”的现象，束缚了调车工作人员的积极性、创造性，影响调车工作效率不能提高，以致车站上的列车经常不能及时编成和正点开出，而且容易造成车辆拥塞的事故，影响铁路运输能力的充分发挥。一九四九年，东北铁路学习苏联先进经验，推行“新调车法”以来，完全改变了调车工作上的旧面貌。新调车法贯彻负责制的精神，建立了调车工作上的科学的机构和制度，取消了计划车号员和调车工作计划，改由车站调度员统一掌握全站列车编组和解体计划；由调车员负责组织调车工作，具体实现列车编组和解体计划。这就充分发挥了调车工作人员的积极性、创造性，克服了调车工作上的浪费、列车编组晚点和车辆拥塞的现象，大大提高了调车工作的效率。
    在推行新调车法过程中，沈阳站调车员李锡奎不但带动全站调车组，实行了新调车法，而且在新调车法实践中，创造了一套科学的工作制度和工作方法，不仅保证了工作进展迅速，而且保证了工作的安全。
    珍惜每一秒钟，做好联系
    和配合的工作
    李锡奎调车组的先进经验，是经过长期努力，积累起来的。李锡奎调车组的工作是十分有计划的。他们珍惜每一秒钟，他们善于掌握情况。在每天上班时，他们将值班站长所布置的工作计划记录下来，作为工作的目标，这就是所谓“上班记录制度”。他们利用去调车场的途中，一边走一边讨论工作计划，并订出完成计划的具体措施，这就叫做“走道会议制度”。经过调车场时，他们又分别地了解了调车场线路上的车辆情况，这被称为“线路检查制”。在每天工作完了后，同样地又利用由调车场返回的走道时间开检讨会，总结工作，开展批评，这个会议叫做“工作完了的检讨会”。他们就是这样地抓紧时间做准备工作，利用机会来了解情况，因而减少了非生产时间，保证了不间断的工作。
    李锡奎调车组的分工非常明确，每一件细小的事都指定专人负责。全组一个调车员，四个连结员，都按照各人的能力和专长，进行了具体的分工。这就是他们自己所说的“分工负责制”。每天上班后经过调车场检查线路时，他们也是事先规定好某人掌管某几条线路，负责了解车辆目的地，以及那些车辆在编车时受限制等情况，这就是所谓“包线制”“包地带”和“包限制车”。由于真正贯彻了负责制的精神，不但每一件事都有专人掌握，而且发挥了每一个人的工作积极性和创造性。
    李锡奎调车组的联系配合工作，也做得非常好。调车工作是一件错综复杂的工作，必须与有关各方面密切联系配合，才能保证迅速和安全。他们与车站调度员、司机、报道员以及其他有关工作人员，都订立了制度，相互保证密切配合，使工作能够顺利进行。这些制度，叫做“联系制度”。联系制度有力地保证了参与调车工作的工作人员，在调车员的统一领导下，有条不紊地进行工作。
    李锡奎调车组在沈阳站苏联专家克拉维茨工程师的帮助下，采取了郭瓦廖夫的工作方法，集中了几个优秀苏联调车员的先进工作方法，如“活用线路法”“溜放调车法”“连续溜放调车法”以及“解体照顾编成”等，构成了李锡奎调车法。这个调车法解决了调车作业上的许多技术问题，因而大大提高了工作效率。
    李锡奎调车组的这些工作制度和工作方法，是一套科学的调车工作法，也是一套完整的先进工作经验。它学习了苏联先进经验，集中了先进的工作方法，在具体运用上，并有着进一步的创造与发展，因而显著地提高了调车工作的效率，减少了工作上的浪费，为国家积累了大量财富。这正是中国工人阶级的创造性与苏联先进经验相结合的生动、具体的范例。
        李锡奎调车组的先进经验，
    是在战胜各种保守思想后推广
    起来的
    如像其他无数的模范人物一样，李锡奎调车组也是战胜了各种保守的思想之后创造了今天这样的事迹。一九四九年八月，沈阳站李锡奎调车组成立时，除了调车员李锡奎曾在本站做过连结员工作外，其余四个连结员都是新从别的车站调来。那时李锡奎还只是个青年团员。在日寇和国民党统治下，这五位饱受了折磨和苦痛的青年工友，在解放以后，深深体验到共产党给自己带来了温暖和光明，无论在工作上或学习中，都是非常努力。李锡奎经常对大家说：“日本小鬼子临走时说过：你们沈阳站三十年也管不好。解放后怎么样？人少了，活还干得比以前多。咱们工人当了家，就是有力量。咱们青年调车组更得好好干，好好学习呀！”从李锡奎调车组成立那天起，党、青年团和工会就派人帮助他们，提高他们的政治、文化、业务水平，教育他们团结群众，团结技术人员，虚心学习苏联先进经验。在调车组成立的不几天，李锡奎光荣地参加了中国共产党。由于李锡奎积极工作的影响，全组工作更起劲了，学习也更努力了。半年以后，四个青年都先后地成为青年团员。
    一九五○年三月，沈阳站领导方面号召试行新调车法。全站大多数工友，在思想上普遍抵抗新调车法。他们认为：“过去凭计划车号员的通知单干活，还要出错，这一来非得乱头不可。”“多少年来就这样干，哪还有错？”“咱们文化低，干不了！”也有一部分工友认为：“新调车法又费脑筋又费劲，出错还得负责任。”车站上的中层干部也多没信心：“瞧你们怎么干得了！”这时候，李锡奎调车组的全体工友，经过商量研究，自动向领导方面要求试行。车站上的苏联专家克拉维茨工程师亲自来教他们。一个多礼拜后，李锡奎调车组开始单独用新调车法进行工作。起初不熟练，也很忙乱，不但编组列车慢，而且常出错返工。有时机车停在一边等着。编组一列车最长用过三小时。已经编成的列车有十分之四、五要返工。每天的任务总完不成。为了研究克服困难的办法，李锡奎曾经十多天吃不下饭。当时有一股力量支持着他：“共产党员没有克服不了的困难！”他动员连结员李忠信等，把家搬到沈阳，住在一起，利用休班时间，进行演习，专心钻研编车方法。他们又主动请求车站中、苏工程师帮助，建立工作上的分工负责制，发挥全组工友的积极性创造性，使全组工作有了好转。他们逐渐克服了忙乱的现象，每天的任务，开始能够按时完成了。
    在李锡奎调车组的影响下，去年有一部分工友和干部开始改变了过去认为新调车法行不通的想法，也愿意亲自试试看。沈阳站领导方面决定自五月份起，全站普遍推行新调车法。但是，还有一部分老工友不服气，觉得：“这些小孩子有什么？过几天就会垮台！”李锡奎和全组工友一方面虚心团结周围群众，主动在下班时间找老工友请教，征求他们的意见，学习他们的优点；另一方面又继续钻研调车工作。经过小组不断的讨论，又建立了一些工作制度，学会了几种先进的工作方法，使调车工作效率不断提高。这样，渐渐地改变了老工友们的看法，许多调车组开始采用了李锡奎调车组的工作经验。
    一九五○年十一月底，沈阳站工会号召全站学习李锡奎的工作方法。但由于当时仍有部分工友感到
    “差不多，没什么出奇”，以致未能及时把新工作法广泛推广出去。今年三月，沈阳站总结了李锡奎的先进经验，工会又组织了短期训练班，由李锡奎报告并示范。通过实际工作，使全站工友进一步认识到李锡奎调车组工作经验的优越性。从这时候起，李锡奎调车法不仅在沈阳站，而且在中长铁路局管内广泛地推广了。
    为了进一步提高全国铁路调车工作，保证完成国家运输任务，中央人民政府铁道部已于今年八月间发布指示，全面推广李锡奎调车组的先进工作经验。目前李锡奎和他的调车组，在全国五十余万铁路职工中，已经成为一面鲜明的旗帜。在这一面旗帜的号召下，全国铁路职工更将虚心学习苏联先进经验，创造新的工作方法，为国家积累财富。（附图片）
