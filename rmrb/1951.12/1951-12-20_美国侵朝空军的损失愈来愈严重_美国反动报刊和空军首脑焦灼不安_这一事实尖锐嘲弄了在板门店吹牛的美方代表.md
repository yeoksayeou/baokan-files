Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The increasingly severe losses of the US invading air force in Korea have caused great concern and anxiety among the US bourgeois press and air force chiefs.

The "New York Times," in an article on November 4 specifically discussing the air situation in Korea, cited a serious example: In an air raid "covered by jets as usual," "most of our (US) bombers were shot up by attacking jets," and the casualties of the US Air Force alone reached sixty-two, "These numbers caused great commotion in the Far East Air Force Command." The newspaper then concluded: "It immediately became clear that the United Nations could no longer sustain such losses for long without seriously weakening the air force."

The next day, the "New York Times" published another article by military reporter Baldwin on this issue, complaining about the US Air Force's vague war reports. Baldwin pointed out that the air force and air defense forces of the Chinese and Korean People's forces "have now become a major threat, even for the United Nations air force's current shallow incursions into North Korea." As for deeper bombing activities, they "have had to be carried out at night."

The facts are so stark that the US Air Force chief in Korea, Fifth Air Force Commander Major General Everest, recently openly admitted that the US military's so-called "air supremacy" is under "real threat"; and Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg even admitted that the US Air Force no longer possesses complete air supremacy, leaving only the so-called "air initiative." Vandenberg also said that in order to cope with the increasing threat, the United States must "bring out more aircraft, which were originally intended to be used for air defense in the US mainland, for other overall obligations, and for gradually building up our entire air force strength." Vandenberg's words show that the huge losses of the US Air Force on the Korean battlefield have seriously affected the US Air Force's entire aggression plan.

In the face of relentless facts, even the United States Information Service could not but admit that "some American editors, like the 'San Francisco Chronicle,' expressed concern about 'our (US) air combat in Korea not going very well.'" The "Washington Star" frankly stated in its editorial on the 13th: "The losses of the US Air Force in Korea have made Americans greatly uneasy." The newspaper acknowledged that the losses of US aircraft were "far greater" than those admitted in the US military communiqués, which deliberately "conceal bad news." The newspaper's editorial "protested against the optimistic reports on air combat issued in Tokyo."

The anxiety of the US newspapers and officials regarding the huge losses of the US invading air force in Korea is a sharp mockery of those US representatives like Turner, who are still boasting about US military power in the Panmunjom armistice talks.

### 美国侵朝空军的损失愈来愈严重  美国反动报刊和空军首脑焦灼不安  这一事实尖锐嘲弄了在板门店吹牛的美方代表

    美国侵朝空军的损失愈来愈严重
    美国反动报刊和空军首脑焦灼不安
    这一事实尖锐嘲弄了在板门店吹牛的美方代表
    【新华社十八日讯】美国侵朝空军愈来愈严重的损失，已引起美国资产阶级报界和空军首脑的极大忧虑和不安。
    “纽约时报”在十一月四日一篇专门讨论朝鲜空中局势的文章中举出情况严重的一个例子：在一次“像平常一样地由喷气机掩护着”的空袭中，“我们（美方）大部分的轰炸机都被进攻的喷气机击伤了”，仅这一次美国空军人员的损伤就达六十二名，“这些数字在远东空军司令部里引起了极大的骚动”。该报于是得出结论：“事情立刻变得很明显，联合国不能再长期地遭受这种损失而不严重地削弱空军的力量。”
    第二天，“纽约时报”又登载军事记者鲍尔温的关于这个问题的一篇文章，抱怨美国空军发表含糊其辞的战报。鲍尔温指出，中朝人民部队的空军和防空部队，“即使是就联合国空军目前浅近地伸入北朝鲜的空袭而言，现在也已经成为一个重大的威胁”。至于比较深入的轰炸活动，就“已经不得不在夜间进行”了。
    事实是如此冷酷，以致美国在朝鲜的空军首脑、第五航空队司令爱佛莱斯特少将最近公开承认，美军的所谓“制空权”已受到“真正的威胁”；而空军参谋长范顿伯更承认：美国空军已不再掌握完全的制空权，只剩下所谓“空中的主动权”的东西了。范顿伯又说，为了应付日益加大的威胁，美国必须“拿出更多的飞机来，这些飞机原来是要用在美国大陆的空防，用在其他的全盘义务和用在有步骤地建立我们全部空军力量上的。”范顿伯的话表明，美国空军在朝鲜战场上的巨大损失，已经严重地影响了美国空军整个的侵略计划。
    在无情的事实的面前，连美国新闻处也不能不承认：美国“若干编辑与‘旧金山纪事报’一样，对‘我们（美方）在朝鲜的空战进行得不很顺利’一点，表示忧虑。”“华盛顿明星报”在十三日的社论中坦白地说：“美国空军在朝鲜的损失，已使美国人大为不安。”该报承认，美国飞机的损失，比故意“隐瞒坏消息的”美国军事公报中所承认的要“多得多”。该报社论“对东京发表的关于空战的乐观报告，提出抗议。”
    美国报纸与官方人士对于侵朝美国空军巨大损失的焦灼，对于那些仍在板门店停战谈判中吹嘘美国军事力量的美方代表滕纳之流，正是一个尖锐的嘲弄。（附图片）
