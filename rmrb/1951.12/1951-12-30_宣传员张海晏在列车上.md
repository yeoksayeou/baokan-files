    Propagandist Zhang Haiyan on the Train
      Hao Hao
    Zhang Haiyan, a public security officer on the Beijing-Hankou Railway (now working at the Xuchang Railway Station Public Security Office), was originally a model train propagandist of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration. In early March, he proposed to complete the task of conducting patriotic propaganda and education to 50,000 passengers within three months.
    "How can 50,000 passengers be educated in patriotism?" He considered this question every day. Although he had a low level of education and no experience in propaganda, he achieved excellent results due to his high enthusiasm for work and diligent study. After each lecture, he would patiently ask passengers for their opinions, asking them: "Do you understand?" The answer was: "Give more practical examples and use fewer difficult-to-understand terms."
    After obtaining this key, Zhang Haiyan collected relevant propaganda materials from the masses at any time and place, and carried out propaganda to passengers in various forms. Once, he explained the significance of "opposing the United States' arming of Japan" to passengers, which was warmly welcomed by the masses because the materials he collected in advance were mostly based on the personal experiences of the passengers, and the language was simple and easy to understand. After mobilizing the masses, he organized some of the train staff and passengers who volunteered to participate in a "train parade." The "parade" team gave speeches to the passengers in each carriage and led everyone in shouting slogans. After the parade, many passengers who had suffered persecution from the Japanese invaders automatically stood up to make accusations.
    When Comrade Zhang Haiyan was conducting propaganda, he paid great attention to studying the preferences of the masses. He often compiled clapper talks according to the passengers' ideological situation and preferences to promote to everyone. His clapper talks were simple, powerful, and combined with his individual visits and explanations to the passengers. The audience was convinced and said: "Comrade Zhang is very thorough!"
    In this way, Comrade Zhang Haiyan completed the task of conducting patriotic propaganda to 50,000 passengers in two and a half months, and achieved good results. Passengers who had heard his propaganda said: "The new China led by Chairman Mao has changed everywhere. Even taking a train, we have learned a lot about national affairs!" He was often pulled to another carriage by passengers from another carriage after giving a lecture in one carriage. The passengers said: "Go quickly! We all welcome you to tell us about national affairs!"

    宣传员张海晏在列车上
      浩浩
    京汉铁道上的列车公安员张海晏（现在已调许昌车站公安所工作），原是郑州铁路管理局的一个模范列车宣传员。他在三月初即提出，要在三个月内完成向五万旅客进行爱国主义宣传教育的任务。
    “怎样才能使五万旅客受到爱国主义的教育呢？”他每天在考虑这一问题。虽然他文化水平低，没有宣传经验，但由于他工作热情高，努力学习，终于获得了很好的成绩。在每讲完一个问题后，他都耐心地向旅客征求意见，问他们：“听得懂吗？”回答是：“多举一些实际例子，少用不好懂的名词。”
    张海晏得到这个窍门后，便随时随地向群众收集有关的宣传材料，用各种宣传形式向旅客进行宣传。有一次他向旅客讲解“反对美国武装日本”的意义，受到群众热烈欢迎，因为他事前搜集的材料多是旅客的亲身经历，而且语言通俗易懂。群众发动起来后，他又组织一部分车上的工作人员和自愿报名参加的旅客在车上举行“列车游行”。“游行”队伍每到一个车厢，就向旅客作讲演，并带领大家呼口号。游行后，很多曾遭受日寇迫害的旅客都自动起来控诉。
    张海晏同志在宣传的时候，很注意研究群众的喜好，他常常根据旅客的思想情况和爱好，编成快板向大家宣传。他的快板通俗有力，再加上他向旅客进行个别访问和解释，听众口服心服地说：“张同志说的头头是道！”
    就是这样，张海晏同志在两个半月里就完成了向五万旅客进行爱国宣传的任务，并且收到良好效果。听过他宣传的旅客说：“毛主席领导的新中国，到处变了样。坐趟火车，还知道了很多国家大事！”他在一个车厢里宣传，经常被另一车厢的旅客拉去。旅客们说：“快去吧！我们都欢迎你去给讲讲国家大事！”
