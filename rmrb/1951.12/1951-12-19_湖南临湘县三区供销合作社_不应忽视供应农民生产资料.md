    The No. 3 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Linxiang County, Hunan Province
    Should Not Neglect the Supply of Agricultural Production Materials to Farmers
    To the Editor:
    The No. 3 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Linxiang County, Hunan Province, has more than 10,000 members and a capital of more than 130 million yuan. However, because the cooperative's business policy is not clear, it has only focused on the supply of consumer goods to its members in its business operations, while neglecting the supply of production materials. Therefore, it cannot serve its members well. For example, the goods operated by this cooperative are mostly consumer goods, especially various kinds of cloth (which is of course also needed). However, the production materials needed by the members, such as plows, hoes, harrows, and other agricultural implements, are not prepared at all. In addition, this cooperative has not done enough to promote the sales of agricultural and sideline products of its members.
    I believe that the main task of the supply and marketing cooperative should first be to supply farmers with production materials to develop agricultural production, and at the same time to supply daily necessities and promote the sales of agricultural and sideline products of its members to improve their living standards. The No. 3 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Linxiang County must clarify this policy, orient its business operations towards production, and change its practice of simply operating consumer goods.

### 湖南临湘县三区供销合作社  不应忽视供应农民生产资料

    湖南临湘县三区供销合作社
    不应忽视供应农民生产资料
    编辑同志：湖南省临湘县三区供销合作社有社员
    一万多人，资金一亿三千多万元。但因为这个社的经营方针不明确，所以在业务上只注意了对社员生活资料的供应而忽略了对生产资料的供应，因此不能很好地为社员服务。例如这个社经营的货物大都是消费品，尤其是各种布匹很多（这当然也需要）。但社员所需要的生产资料如犁、锄、耙和其他农具却一点也没有预备。此外，这个合作社对社员的农、副产品的推销也做得很不够。
    我认为供销合作社的主要任务，首先应该是供给农民生产资料，以发展农业生产，同时供应生活必需品和推销社员的农、副产品来提高他们的生活水平。临湘县三区供销合作社必须明确这一方针，使业务经营面向生产，改变单纯经营消费品的作法。
