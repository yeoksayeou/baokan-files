Summary of Shanghai's Pilot Promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China Tang Guifen

In early September, the representatives who attended the Qingdao fine yarn conference returned to Shanghai. The East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China jointly decided that all representatives should go to the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory to focus on promotion. After the key team in the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory gained typical experience, eight "Hao Jianxiu Work Method Study Classes" were held in the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory and Shenxin No. 1 Factory. Seventy public and private cotton textile factories in Shanghai sent representatives to participate in the study. The study classes trained a total of 898 fine yarn workers, technicians, and trade union cadres. Currently, in addition to the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory and Shenxin No. 1 Factory, each of which has a workshop that has been fully promoted, 36 other cotton textile factories are in the process of promotion, and 34 cotton textile factories are preparing for promotion.

	Achievements of the Pilot Promotion Work

(1) Reduced roller laps, improved the output and quality of cotton yarn. The roller laps of the key promotion team in the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory have been reduced from 0.715% to 0.394%. The roller laps of the key promotion team in Shenxin No. 1 Factory have been reduced from 1.513% to 1.108%. Other factories that have already started promotion have also achieved good results. During the study classes, the average roller lap rate during the operation of students from various factories was 0.835%. Compared with the city's average roller lap rate of 1.5% (incomplete statistics), it was reduced by 44%. If all factories in the city can reach the level of the study classes, the monthly output of cotton yarn can be increased by 944 pieces, and the annual output can be increased by 11,328 pieces. After the implementation of the Hao Jianxiu work method, the quality of cotton yarn has also been improved. The "tight twist yarn" and "thick section yarn" caused by unreasonable operation methods in the past, and the increase in waste, have now been eliminated.

(2) Corrected the "three diligences and three quicks" bias that occurred in some yarn factories during the pilot promotion work. Before the organized and comprehensive promotion, some factories had already tried to promote it, and some workers were learning it automatically. However, most workers did not understand the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method. They simply increased the intensity of labor and learned "three diligences and three quicks." The so-called "three diligences and three quicks" means that when they see a broken end, they immediately piece it together, piecing the ends together as if in a race. Female workers in the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory did all the cleaning preparations before going to work, and then concentrated on piecing the ends together after work; the ends broke quickly, and people ran quickly. Individual factory leaders even one-sidedly called on workers to learn Hao Jianxiu's "three diligences and three quicks." As a result of this kind of learning, the number of sick workers increased, and a serious phenomenon of activists becoming detached from the masses occurred. For example, when Yang Xiaozhen of Yong'an No. 2 Factory learned "three diligences and three quicks," she was often so tired that she couldn't eat, and the backward workers even ridiculed her. A small number of students participating in the study class also had concerns at the beginning, fearing that their bodies would not be able to bear it. However, when they saw the little teachers' performance, it was not a "cat-and-mouse" style race, but a steady progress according to certain rules, plus their own experience of practicing on the machines, they completely changed their incorrect views on the Hao Jianxiu work method. Qian Liumei, an old worker from the state-owned Shanghai No. 20 Cotton Textile Factory, said: "When I saw comrades learning in our factory, they were so diligent that I was really scared; later I tried it myself, and I could do it too. I feel like I'm twenty years younger." Learning the Hao Jianxiu work method can indeed reduce the intensity of labor and increase the ability to watch the machines. Yi Shijuan of the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory ran 5,201 steps in two hours before learning, but only 2,000 steps after learning. Her ability to watch the machines has also increased. A worker in Shenxin No. 1 Factory originally watched 252 spindles in the factory, but after going to the study class, she could watch 384 spindles.

(3) Reformed some unreasonable systems and improved production. For example, the cleaning inspection system was mechanically stipulated to be inspected in the morning. When the female workers were busy doing cleaning work, they could not take care of the broken ends. Now, the method of combining several tasks adopted by Hao Jianxiu has gradually changed the past bad habits. Secondly, the division of labor between doffers and end piecers was unreasonable in the past, but now it has been improved. In the past, some factories did not have a system of separately weighing roller laps, and could not calculate the amount of roller laps for each person. Now, a system of separate weighing has been established. Improvements have also been made in tools and labor protection.

In the process of promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, many equipment and technical shortcomings have also been improved. For example, the state-owned Shanghai No. 11 Cotton Textile Factory improved the machine equipment, so that the end breakage rate was reduced from 360 times per thousand spindles per hour to 280 times. The capitalists of Shenxin No. 1 Factory took out all the new spindle bases and new bobbins for use, which improved the serious phenomenon of jumping bobbins and crooked spindles. The winding and warping workers of Shenxin No. 1 Factory wiped the machines while piecing the ends together, which increased production.

(4) Created a model of combining labor and technology. At the beginning of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method, some technicians still believed that this was "just increasing the intensity of labor" and "reducing a few taels of roller laps is nothing special." Some people even thought that this was asking workers to do more manual labor and was a "Communist Party's way of managing workers." After the work method was promoted, achievements were made, and after the enlightenment and education of leading cadres, the conservative and complacent thinking of some technicians has been basically reversed. In the past, they did not pay attention to workers' creations, and stopped female workers from combining sweeping and end piecing. They thought that "if two tasks are done together, neither will be done well." They themselves felt that they had technology, but had nowhere to use it, so-called "heroes have no place to use their talents." Now they know how to combine labor and technology to improve and increase production.

(5) In the key experiments and promotions, the Hao Jianxiu work method has been enriched and enriched. In addition to the method of checking roving, bad bobbins, and yarn guides created by Gu Xiuying of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, and the method of reversing knots created by Tian Afeng, the following are currently in common use and are sufficient to enrich the Hao Jianxiu work method: 1. Xiang Fengqi of the state-owned Shanghai No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory reduced the number of steps running when making turns during patrol. The turning method improved by Xiang Fengqi reduces the number of patrol steps by about one-tenth. At the same time, it can also take care of broken ends. 2. Some workers combine several cleaning tasks. When cleaning the roller lap frames, the original cleaning of the yarn guide plate and the rear plush roller spring, which was divided into three times, is combined and carried out, which can save time and do more other cleaning work.

	Several Experiences in Pilot Promotion

(1) The promotion work should be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, and various parties should be mobilized to cooperate. Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, said: "The Hao Jianxiu work method is an innovation movement in textile production." Therefore, the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method must become a mass movement. Facts have proved that only under the unified leadership of the Party Committee and with the close cooperation of all parties can the promotion work form a mass movement. When promoting, most factories established promotion committees including leading cadres and old worker technicians from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, as the leading core to solve many problems.

(2) Do a good job in political mobilization and ideological education. The Hao Jianxiu work method is a scientific work method that improves labor organization and increases labor productivity. It must be promoted after the working class has a high degree of political awareness and establishes a sense of ownership of labor. The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method still increases the intensity of labor for workers with a relatively poor attitude towards labor. For these workers, sufficient political education must be carried out so that they can consciously carry out labor with the attitude of masters, and should not simply emphasize reducing the intensity of labor. The workers' ideological concerns about the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method are first of all "fear of hardship." At the beginning of the promotion, many workers reflected that "it's unbearable not to leave the alley all day long" and "this work method can be learned by young people, but it's hard for old workers to 'learn to play musical instruments at eighty'." Some were worried that "I can bear it during the day, but I can't bear it at night." Secondly, there are complacency and conservative ideas. Cadres feel that "we also have work methods, but we haven't summarized them"; old workers reflect that "what can a little girl do? I've been doing it for decades, and I'm not as good as her!" Seeing the little teachers not leaving the alley, they say that unless they make a few more pairs of shoes and put a commode in the alley, they can't not come out. After watching the little teachers' performance, they said that their bones were hard and they couldn't learn it. Administrative managers are afraid that after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method, the system will be broken and it will be impossible to manage. This is the main obstacle in promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method. In response to these ideas, we have carried out patriotism and internationalism education through various publicity methods, such as blackboards, broadcasts, comics, slogans, and plays, to politically enlighten the masses, explain the great significance of promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and educate workers to establish a new attitude towards labor; and we have used the method of calculating detailed accounts to tell the masses the economic value of the Hao Jianxiu work method. After these publicity and education, and the workers' experience in actual work, everyone can now generally recognize the value and significance of the Hao Jianxiu work method and actively learn it. They said that learning the Hao Jianxiu work method is like eating olives, the good taste is behind.

(3) The promotion work should become one of the central tasks of each factory, and it should be combined with other central tasks. The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method is not only the work of one department in the fine yarn workshop, nor is it a purely technical training work, but it is necessary to mobilize the masses to form a broad mass movement. Private factories are currently actively carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy and donate, and some factories have flexibly combined donation with promotion work. By promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, reducing roller laps, and saving waste, they have completed the donation plan. Doing so not only has no impact on the donation work, but has promoted the increase in production and donation.

(4) The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method can make trade union work further oriented towards production. This is what we have deeply realized in the promotion work. In the past, when tasks came, we only had general appeals, but no specific and in-depth work. Therefore, the work had no foundation. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method, our trade union work took a step forward, and we discovered many problems in production. In the future, we will continue to work hard to enlighten the wisdom of the workers and masses, promote the good experience of the workers, enrich and enrich the Hao Jianxiu work method, and make the Hao Jianxiu work method a complete work method.

	Future Work

(1) Strengthen the leading organization, promote the Hao Jianxiu work method from point to surface, with leadership and in a planned way. After the students participating in the study class return to the factory, some have already carried out promotion work. In the process of promotion, they will encounter various ideological, institutional, and equipment obstacles, and the relevant leading cadres must promptly grasp the situation and help solve them. We plan to organize inspection teams, regularly convene meetings of promoters from various factories, exchange experiences, introduce typical examples, and provide specific assistance to factories with more difficulties, so that the promotion work can be carried out throughout the city.

(2) Combine the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy with the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method, so that the Hao Jianxiu work method becomes one of the important methods for doing a good job in increasing production and practicing economy and completing the increase in production and donation. At present, some administrative and trade union leading cadres in some factories do not pay enough attention to the promotion work, and are afraid that they will not be able to complete it if there are too many tasks. Individual private factory directors emphasize that they are too busy, so they are unwilling to participate in the work of the promotion committee. Some trade union chairmen are afraid of affecting the central work when promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, and on the other hand, they believe that "there are no achievements to show yet, so it is not good to promote it." In fact, if the promotion work is carried out in combination with the movement to increase production and practice economy, the promotion work can be carried out smoothly and greater achievements can be made in increasing production and practicing economy. In October, the state-owned Shanghai No. 11 Cotton Textile Factory increased the output of cotton yarn by five and a half pieces after promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method in Shenxin No. 1 Factory, it saved the equivalent of eleven pieces of yarn waste in the first half of November.

(3) In factories that have already been promoted, carry out publicity, establish systems, and consolidate the Hao Jianxiu work method. We will mobilize the masses to add the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method to the patriotic convention, so that the promotion and consolidation of the Hao Jianxiu work method becomes a patriotic action of the masses. At the same time, it is recommended that the administration establish a reward system and a yarn weighing system to overcome ideological and institutional obstacles. And mobilize the doffers, maintenance workers, roller lap workshop, and workers in the front spinning and other departments to cooperate with the promotion work, ensure that semi-finished products are made well, and repair the machines, so that the promotion work can be carried out smoothly.

    上海市试行推广郝建秀工作法的总结
    中国纺织工会上海市委员会主席  汤桂芬
    九月初，出席青岛细纱会议的代表回到上海。华东纺织管理局和中国纺织工会上海市委员会共同决定全体代表到国营上海第三棉纺织厂作重点推广。在国营上海第三棉纺织厂重点小组取得典型经验后，又在国营上海第三棉纺织厂和申新一厂举办了八期“郝建秀工作法学习班”。上海七十家公私营棉纺织厂都派代表参加学习。学习班共计培养了细纱工人、技术人员及工会干部八九八人。目前除了国营上海第三棉纺织厂和申新一厂已各有一个车间完全推广之外，另有三十六家棉纺织厂正在推广，三十四家棉纺织厂准备推广。
        试行推广工作的收获
    （一）减少了皮辊花，提高了棉纱的产量和质量。国营上海第三棉纺织厂重点推广小组的皮辊花，已从百分之○·七一五降低到百分之○·三九四。申新一厂的重点推广组的皮辊花，已从百分之一·五一三减至百分之一·一○八。其他已经开始推广的厂子，也已获得很好的成绩。在学习班举办期间，各厂学员操作时的平均皮辊花率是百分之○·八三五，与全市平均皮辊花率百分之一·五（不完全的统计）比较，减低了百分之四四。如果全市各厂都能达到学习班的水平，则每月可增产棉纱九四四件，一年可增产一一、三二八件。推行郝建秀工作法后，棉纱质量也有改进。过去因为操作方法不合理而造成的“紧撚纱”、“粗节纱”和增加回丝的情况，现在都消灭了。
    （二）纠正了部分纱厂在试行推广工作中发生的“三勤三快”的偏向。在有组织的全面推广之前，一部分工厂已经试行推广，有些工人在自动学习。但大多数工人并不了解郝建秀工作法的基本精神，她们只是增加劳动强度，学习“三勤三快”。所谓
    “三勤三快”，就是看见断头就接，接头好像赛跑。国营上海第五棉纺织厂女工在上班以前，做好了全部清洁准备工作，上班以后就集中精神接头；头断得快，人跑得快。个别厂的领导干部还片面地号召工人学习郝建秀的“三勤三快”。这样学习的结果，就使得病号增加，并且发生了积极分子脱离群众的严重现象。如永安二厂杨小珍学习“三勤三快”时，常累得吃不下饭去，落后工人还讽刺她。参加学习班的少数学员，在开始时也有顾虑，怕身体吃不消。但是，当着她们看到小先生表演时，并不是“猫捉老鼠”式的赛跑，而是照一定的规律稳步前进，再加上她们自己上车实习的体验，便完全改变了对郝建秀工作法的不正确看法。国营上海第二十棉纺织厂老工人钱六妹说：“我在本厂看同志们学习时，那么勤快，实在害怕；后来我试了试，也能行。我的年纪就像减少了二十年。”学习郝建秀工作法，确能减低劳动强度，增加看台能力。国营上海第三棉纺织厂裔式娟，在学习前，二小时跑五千二百零一步，学习以后只跑二千步。她的看台能力也增加了。申新一厂的一个工人，原来在厂里看二五二锭，到学习班后，能看三八四锭。
    （三）改革了某些不合理的制度，改进了生产。如清洁检查制度，过去机械地规定为上午检查。当女工们忙着做清洁工作时，便照顾不了断头。现在采取了郝建秀把几种工作结合起来的办法，逐渐改变了过去的陋习。其次，过去落纱工与接头工的分工不合理，现在也改进了。有些厂子过去没有皮辊花分别过磅的制度，不能计算每人的皮辊花数量，现在已建立了分别过磅制度。在工具和劳动保护方面，也都有所改进。
    在推广郝建秀工作法过程中，也改进了许多设备和技术上的缺点。如国营上海第十一棉纺织厂改进了机器设备，使断头率从每小时每千锭三百六十次减至二百八十次。申新一厂资方把所有的新锭胆和新筒管都拿出来使用，改善了严重的跳筒管、歪锭子现象。申新一厂络经机工人揩车时同时接头，增加了产量。
    （四）创造了劳动与技术相结合的范例。在开始推广郝建秀工作法时，有些技术人员还认为这“只不过是增加劳动强度”、“少出几两皮辊花，没啥稀奇”。有些人甚至认为这是叫工人多做生活，是“共产党管理工人的办法”。工作法推广以后，有了成绩，再经领导干部的启发教育，已经基本上扭转了一部分技术人员的保守自满思想。他们过去不重视工人创造，看见女工把扫地和接头两项工作结合在一起，就加以阻止。认为“两样工作放在一起做，都做不好”。他们自己觉得自己有技术，但没处使，所谓“英雄无用武之地”。现在知道了怎样使劳动与技术结合，来改进和提高生产。
    （五）在重点试验与推广中，充实和丰富了郝建秀工作法，除了国营上海第一棉纺织厂古秀英创造的检查粗纱、坏筒管和导纱眼工作法，田阿凤创造的反结头工作法以外，目前已经普遍用，足以充实郝建秀工作法的还有：一、国营上海第六棉纺织厂湘凤琪减少巡回转弯时所跑步数。湘凤琪改进的转弯方法，大约减少了十分之一的巡回步数。同时，还可以照顾断头。二、有的工人把几项清洁工作结合进行。清洁皮辊架子时，把原来分为三次做的清洁导纱板和后绒辊弹簧，结合在一起进行，可以节省时间，多做其他清洁工作。
        试行推广中的几点体会
    （一）推广工作要在党委的统一领导下，发动各方面配合进行。中国纺织工会全国委员会陈少敏主席说过：“郝建秀工作法是纺织生产上的革新运动”，因之，推广郝建秀工作法，一定要成为群众运动。事实证明，只有在党委的统一领导下，各方面密切配合，才能使推广工作形成群众运动。各厂在推广的时候，大部分成立了包括党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部和老工人技术人员的推广委员会，作为领导核心，解决了很多问题。
    （二）要做好政治动员和思想教育工作。郝建秀工作法是改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率的科学工作法。它一定要在工人阶级有了高度的政治觉悟，树立了主人翁的劳动态度之后才能推广。推广郝建秀工作法，对于劳动态度较差的工人来说，还是要增加劳动强度的。对于这些工人，必须进行充分的政治教育，使他们自觉地以主人翁的态度进行劳动，而不应单纯强调减低劳动强度。工人对推广郝建秀工作法的思想顾虑，首先是“怕吃苦”。开始推广时，不少工友反映“一天到晚不出弄堂吃不消”、“这工作法年轻人能学，老工人是‘八十学吹打’，难了”。有的发愁“白天吃得消，晚上吃不消”。其次是自满及保守思想。干部觉得“工作法我们也有，就是没有总结”；老工人反映“小姑娘能做出啥来？我做了几十年了，还不如她！”看见小先生不出弄堂，就说，除非多做几双鞋子，弄堂里放下马桶，才能不出来。看了小先生表演后，又说自己骨头硬了，学不来。行政管理人员则怕郝建秀工作法推广以后，打烂了制度，没法管理。这是推广郝建秀工作法中的主要障碍。我们针对这些思想，通过各种宣传方式，如黑板报、广播、漫画、标语及演戏等，进行爱国主义与国际主义教育，从政治上启发群众，说明推广郝建秀工作法对于抗美援朝的重大意义，教育工人树立新的劳动态度；并用算细账的方式，把郝建秀工作法的经济价值告诉群众，经过了这些宣传教育，以及工人在实际工作中的体会，现在大家大都能认识到郝建秀工作法的价值和意义，而积极学习。她们说，学习郝建秀工作法好像吃橄榄，好滋味在后头。
    （三）推广工作要成为各厂中心工作之一，并且要和其他中心工作结合起来。推广郝建秀工作法并不单是细纱间一个部门的工作，也不是单纯技术性的训练工作，而须要发动群众，形成广泛的群众运动。私营厂目前正在积极进行增产节约捐献运动，有些厂就灵活地把捐献与推广工作结合起来，通过推广郝建秀工作法，减少皮辊花，节省回丝，完成捐献计划。这样做对捐献工作非但没有影响，反而推动了增产捐献。
    （四）推广郝建秀工作法，可使工会工作进一步面向生产。这一点是我们在推广工作中深深体会到的。过去，任务一来，我们只有一般号召，而没有具体深入的工作。因此，工作没有基础。推广郝建秀工作法以后，我们的工会工作深入了一步，发现了许多生产上的问题。今后我们还要继续努力，启发工人群众的智慧，发扬工人中的好经验，来充实和丰富郝建秀工作法，使郝建秀工作法成为完整的工作法。
        今后的工作
    （一）加强领导机构，由点到面，有领导、有步骤地推广郝建秀工作法。参加学习班的学员回厂以后，一部分已经进行推广工作。他们在推广过程中，将会遇到各种思想上及制度、设备上的障碍，有关领导干部必须及时掌握情况，帮助解决。我们准备组织检查小组，定期召集各厂推广工作者举行会议，交流经验，介绍典型，并对困难较多的厂进行具体帮助，使推广工作能在全市范围内展开。
    （二）结合爱国主义增产节约运动，推广郝建秀工作法，使郝建秀工作法成为搞好增产节约完成增产捐献的重要方法之一。目前有一部分厂的行政及工会领导干部对推广工作还不够重视，害怕任务多了完不成。个别私营厂长强调工作太忙，因此不愿参加推广委员会工作。有的工会主席在推广郝建秀工作法时，一方面怕影响中心工作，一方面认为“还没有成绩表现，不好宣传。”事实上，如果结合增产节约运动，展开推广工作，则推广工作既能顺利展开，增产节约也能获得更大成绩。十月份国营上海第十一棉纺织厂，在推广郝建秀工作法后增产棉纱五件半。申新一厂推广郝建秀工作法以后，十一月上半月节省了相当十一件纱的回花。
    （三）在已经推广的工厂里，展开宣传，建立制度，巩固郝建秀工作法。我们将动员群众把推广郝建秀工作法增订到爱国公约中去，使推广和巩固郝建秀工作法成为群众的爱国行动。同时建议行政建立奖励制度和成纱过磅制度，以克服思想上及制度上的障碍。并发动落纱工、保全工、皮辊间及前纺等各部工人配合推广工作，保证做好半制品，修好机器，使推广工作顺利进行。
