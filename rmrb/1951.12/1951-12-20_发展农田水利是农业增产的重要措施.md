    Developing Farmland Irrigation is an Important Measure for Increasing Agricultural Production
    Zhang Zilin, Director of the Farmland Irrigation Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

    The farmland irrigation work in 1951 achieved great results. Across the country, more than 90 large-scale canals, 1,394,966 small-scale canals, ponds, and dams were built and repaired; 95,209 iron waterwheels were loaned; 150,000 new and repaired wells were dug; the power for mechanical irrigation and drainage increased to 8,000 horsepower; 67,591 other water-lifting tools were added; the newly built and repaired projects expanded the cultivated land's benefited area by 9,020,000 mu; and the repaired projects guaranteed and improved the cultivated land's benefited area by more than 71,500,000 mu, achieving greater results than in 1950 (according to 1950, the irrigated area was expanded by 7,760,000 mu, and the guaranteed and improved benefited area was more than 29,700,000 mu), increasing grain production by an estimated minimum of 5 billion jin. This enormous achievement is inseparable from the popularization and deepening of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the completion of land reform in most areas, and the importance and support given by the people's governments and the Communist Party at all levels to water conservancy work related to the vital interests of farmers. At the same time, it is also an important achievement of the patriotic production increase movement of farmers.

    In 1952, mass farmland irrigation work will continue to be carried out under the policy of patriotic production increase and vigorous drought prevention, and the irrigation management of existing water conservancy facilities will be strengthened, and the quality of engineering construction will be further improved. We believe that as long as we earnestly unite and rely on the vast number of workers and peasants, we can not only achieve drought and flood prevention and increase the unit area yield of agricultural production in the generally high patriotic production increase movement, but also lay a good foundation for the country's long-term construction in farmland irrigation in the future.

    What experiences in this year's farmland irrigation work should be valued and promoted? This can be discussed in three issues:

    I. Relying on the Masses and Adapting to Local Conditions are the Main Keys to Carrying Out Mass Farmland Irrigation Work

    Promoting waterwheels, digging and repairing wells are the most reliable ways to solve drought problems in the North and ensure bumper harvests of crops. Since the founding of New China, thanks to the attention of the central and local people's governments, the waterwheel and well industry has developed rapidly; especially the newly designed, lightweight, and liberated tube waterwheel has been warmly welcomed by farmers all over the country. At present, the areas where waterwheels are used for irrigation are no longer limited to the provinces of North China and Shandong; in provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Liaoxi, Yunnan, and even Guangdong and Xinjiang, where waterwheels have never been used or rarely used, they have all expressed that they will promote them in large quantities in the future; Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces have achieved remarkable results in large-scale promotion, which has played a great role in the restoration and improvement of local agricultural production. From the end of 1949 to the present, a total of about 210,000 new and repaired waterwheels have been added across the country, which is equivalent to two-thirds of the total number of waterwheels before the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is one of the most practical help the people's government has given to the emancipated peasants in a short period of two years. Therefore, farmers in various places unanimously thank the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the people's government for their concern. The main problems in waterwheels this year are untimely production and insufficient investigation and research work before lending, which should be paid attention to by various places in the future. In terms of digging and repairing wells, the work has generally been carried out well this year. In several areas of Pingyuan, Shaanxi, and northern Anhui, well-digging for drought resistance has achieved significant results. In Guan County, Pingyuan Province, out of 256 households in a village, 250 households participated in the well-digging campaign and completed 19 new wells. Other prefectures and counties in Pingyuan Province also took Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members as the backbone, and separately linked neighboring organizations to form well-digging mutual aid groups. Many places also organized well-digging technical committees at the county level to solve specific technical difficulties. Under the leadership of the main responsible comrades of the Northwest Administrative Region and the provincial Party and government, Shaanxi Province organized "Cotton Field Bumper Harvest Drought Prevention Committees" at all levels, and completed the task of digging more than 50,000 wells in a sudden attack in just over a month. Under the leadership of the flood prevention and drought resistance headquarters in Fuyang Prefecture, northern Anhui Province, one prefecture alone dug 57,227 wells, which played a decisive role in drought prevention. The cement cylinder wells in Shandong Province, which have long achieved good results, cost less than brick cylinder wells, and other regions can also test and promote them next year. The main problems in digging and repairing wells this year are that the leadership organs at all levels in some areas do not pay enough attention, and no full-time cadres and institutions have been established, so the work is still in a laissez-faire state.

    In the areas of ponds and dams for irrigation in Jiangnan, all provinces have implemented the policy of relying on the peasant masses to build water conservancy, and have overfulfilled their tasks. The Southwest Region originally planned to repair small water conservancy projects this year to expand the irrigated area by 1 million mu, but it completed 2.01 million mu. The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects in the Central South Region accounted for 99.7 percent of all farmland water conservancy projects. In Hunan Province alone, farmers contributed 37,590,000 workdays, excavated 100 million cubic meters of earth, and repaired more than 500,000 ponds and dams, resulting in a bumper harvest of rice throughout the province. The projects undertaken by the masses of peasants in East China on their own also accounted for 98.4% of the total number of projects. The main difficulty at present is that some leading organs do not have a good understanding of the situation, and therefore often lag behind the demands of the peasant masses, and the work is passive. This year, Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, convened a meeting of active members from various townships who were familiar with the local water conservancy situation, clarified the county's water conservancy situation, and laid a good foundation for future development. The Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau also recently convened a provincial water conservancy representative meeting. Because the representatives attending this meeting were all elected by the peasant masses in various counties, this meeting was a meeting that truly connected with the masses. This method of convening water conservancy expert representative meetings can be vigorously promoted next year. In terms of strengthening the grass-roots organizations of the peasant masses, the Anhui South Administrative Region and Zhejiang Province have widely established organizations such as farmland water conservancy committees or pond and dam engineering committees in districts, townships, and villages. Facts have proved that this is an effective measure to carry out work and solve organizational leadership problems. A common phenomenon in this year's farmland irrigation work is the low quality of projects. At present, the scope of mass water conservancy work is gradually expanding, and individual areas have even formed joint actions of several villages, several townships, and even the entire county. Under such circumstances, how to quickly organize and lead the peasants, how to make technology keep up with the needs of the peasant masses in a timely manner, and improve the quality of projects (including increasing water storage capacity) have become issues that should be seriously considered by all regions in the future.

    In short, under the current economic situation, it is completely appropriate and completely necessary to vigorously lead the peasants in various regions to carry out various mass farmland irrigation work in accordance with local conditions. The farmland irrigation leading organs in various regions should regard this as one of the priorities of their work.

    II. Strengthening Irrigation Management and Giving Play to the Potential Capacity of Existing Water Conservancy Facilities are the Basic Measures to Expand Irrigated Area and Increase Production

    Since the central government began to pay attention to reforming the irrigation management system last spring, a democratic reform has generally been carried out in irrigation areas in various places, which is a necessary prerequisite for improving the irrigation management system. Only by doing this work well can we talk about establishing democratic institutions, eliminating disputes, expanding the irrigated area, and finally achieving the goal of rational irrigation. While carrying out the central tasks of rent reduction and interest reduction, suppressing bandits, eliminating special agents, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, Suiyuan Province paid attention to the reform of the management system in the irrigation area. In the past, all water conservancy management organizations in this province were completely controlled by landlords and despots, and water conservancy disputes emerged one after another every year, even causing hatred between the Han and Mongolian peoples; this year, the province strengthened ideological education for farmers and mobilized the peasant masses to overthrow the old management organizations controlled by the landlord class, and changed to management by the water conservancy committee elected by the people themselves. After implementing the democratic reform of the irrigation area, Shanxi Province elected more than 4,000 water conservancy representatives in the major river systems and 23 key water conservancy counties, and used the form of representative meetings to lead and promote the overall work, changing the various unreasonable systems remaining from the old days and expanding the irrigated area by 1,840,000 mu. Xinxiang Prefecture in Pingyuan Province paid attention to the political and ideological mobilization of farmers, improved canal management, and distributed water according to the season, according to the mu of land, and according to the appropriate amount of crops, resulting in each cubic meter of water per second being able to irrigate 26,000 mu of land. Shaanxi Province's public canals reorganized the personnel in charge of water management, and irrigation committees were established by agricultural water conservancy organs and mass representatives. Individual canals also established irrigation demonstration areas, and some branch canals of the Jinghui Canal also adopted the method of supplying water "according to ingredients and times" according to the types of crops and planting areas, which was enthusiastically supported by the peasant masses and ensured the harvest of cotton and wheat this year. The Northeast Region paid attention to training a group of canal management personnel, and individual counties also specially added water conservancy assistants. Some areas implemented "shallow water irrigation" and began to pay attention to improving farming methods and crop water demand experiments, achieving preliminary results in expanding the irrigated area and saving water. In the management of ponds and dams, the provinces of Jiangnan have also begun to pay attention to saving water, reducing water use disputes, and improving water storage efficiency. Southern Jiangsu Administrative Region improved the management of pumping machines, organized private water-drawing merchants, eliminated the intermediate exploitation of feudal water heads, and guaranteed the production of 2.5 million mu of rice fields, which is also a harvest in management. In addition, Guangdong Province has also made many achievements in the development and management of mechanical irrigation.

    Although the farmland irrigation work this year has achieved the above results, there are still serious problems at present. First, although some farmland irrigation organs and workers have begun to change their thinking of emphasizing engineering and neglecting management and the water use system, how to improve and give play to the utilization rate of various existing irrigation facilities is still a major issue. Second, many cadres in irrigation areas still have serious departmentalism. Some district, village, and even county and prefecture cadres are often influenced by the backward, conservative, and selfish ideas of some farmers, and act as the tail of the masses, and cannot correctly distinguish the overall interests from the partial interests, so that water conservancy work cannot be further developed. In the future, we must strengthen the education of mutual assistance and concession of "farmers all over the world are one family" and "overall perspective," and conduct a general survey of all irrigation areas, thoroughly eliminate the old water use regulations of feudal remnants, thoroughly transform the original management personnel, and strictly correct sectarian departmentalism ideas and practices. Third, the view that water use management is completely separated from agricultural production technology must also be corrected. This year, some paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province benefited less than dry land, which is unreasonable. Many areas do not have a good understanding of the basic theory of irrigation, and a large amount of water is used, leading to an increase in alkali and alkalization of the land. These must be seriously improved in the future. Fourth, some areas do not adopt the principle of enterprise management for canal management, and charge less water fees, and have a simple view of giving alms, which also hinders the normal development of the farmland irrigation industry.

    In the future, we should address the above problems and do this work well in accordance with the joint instructions on irrigation management issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government, so as to lay the foundation for the management and use of large-scale modern farmland water conservancy projects in the future.

    III. Focusing on and Prudently Constructing Large-Scale Irrigation Projects is an Important Guarantee for Gradually Increasing Agricultural Production

    This year, more than 90 large-scale irrigation and drainage projects have been built across the country, and the expected benefited area can reach 3 million mu. The Northeast Region continued to restore the four major irrigation areas of Dongliao River, Chahayang, Guoqian Banner, and Panshan, and the projects of small irrigation areas such as Ping'an and Shuanghe in Heilongjiang Province. After a year of efforts, the two major projects of the Hutuo River and Xiahe River in Shanxi Province have completed projects that can irrigate 300,000 mu of land. The area silted by the Sanggan River siltation irrigation project in Chahar Province reached 180,000 mu before and after this year, exceeding the original plan of 150,000 mu of siltation this year. Chahar Province suffered from wind, hail, drought, freezing and other disasters this year, and the average annual yield was only about 30%, while although the irrigated area also suffered from freezing disasters, it was not less than 50% of the annual yield. Therefore, the peasant masses said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we can build water canals well, and our children and grandchildren will not suffer poverty." The state-owned Hangu Farm completed 12,000 mu of water conservancy projects this year. The Luohui Canal in Shaanxi Province paid attention to the work of digging bucket canals, and completed 450 kilometers of canals and more than 600 large and small buildings in two months, so the irrigated area increased from 50,000 mu last year to 240,000 mu. The Yitaiwei mechanical drainage project (operated by public-private joint venture) built in Anhui South Administrative Region this year played a huge role in the severe waterlogging in July, ensuring the perennial output of more than 30,000 mu of rice fields, and it is estimated that it will increase rice production by at least 3 million jin per year in the future. The Taishan Hequebei Irrigation Project in Guangdong Province was built and destroyed three times during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the entire irrigation system was abandoned; now, under the leadership of the people's government, with correct planning and design, close cooperation between administration, technology, and the masses, the task has been successfully completed. This year, the famous Dujiangyan Annual Repair Project in western Sichuan excavated more than 1.2 million cubic meters of river soil, which is equal to the total amount of river soil excavated in the past ten years; in addition, it filled 530,000 cubic meters of earth, installed more than 200,000 bamboo cages, and mobilized nearly 370,000 workers. After such a large-scale renovation, the bumper harvest of 3 million mu of fertile land was guaranteed.

    In the future, the issue of how to do a good job in the overall planning of the irrigation system is a problem that deserves widespread attention in engineering construction. Many areas only pay attention to the research on water intake facilities, but ignore the plans related to water distribution, water use, and coordinated farming. Therefore, the irrigation area cannot fully benefit and quickly benefit, and at the same time, it is easy to cause waste in engineering. In addition, the phenomena of unsound planning and design, low standards, and excessive waste of labor and materials that generally exist in this year's large-scale projects need to be further improved.

    The farmland irrigation engineering construction in 1952 should be carried out more prudently to improve the quality of existing projects. Our leaders and technicians should receive the education that "construction is impossible without correct engineering design," correct our shortcomings and mistakes, and strive to expand the irrigated area and ensure the increase of the unit area yield of agricultural production in order to meet the expectations of the country and the people.

    发展农田水利是农业增产的重要措施
    中央人民政府农业部农田水利局局长　张子林
    一九五一年的农田水利工作有很大成绩。全国共计兴修了大型渠道九十余处，小型渠道塘坝一百三十九万四千九百六十六处，出贷铁制水车九万五千二百零九辆，新打和修复水井十五万眼，机械灌溉和排水的动力增加到八千马力，其他提水工具增加到六万七千五百九十一架，新建和修复工程共计扩大耕地受益面积九百零二万亩，整修工程保障和改善耕地受益面积七千一百五十多万亩，作出了比一九五○年更大的成绩（按一九五○年扩大灌溉面积七百七十六万亩，保障和改善受益面积二千九百七十余万亩），增加粮食产量估计最少有五十亿斤。这巨大的成绩，和抗美援朝爱国运动的普及深入，大部地区土地改革的完成，各级人民政府和共产党对于关系农民切身利益的水利工作的重视和扶助分不开的，同时也是农民的爱国增产运动的一个重要收获。
    一九五二年，将继续在爱国增产和大力防旱的方针下，开展群众性的农田水利工作，并加强现有水利设施的灌溉管理并进一步提高工程建设的质量。我们相信，只要认真团结和依靠广大工人农民，不但可以在普遍高涨的爱国增产运动中做到防旱防涝，提高农业生产的单位面积产量，并且可以打好今后国家在农田水利方面长期建设的良好基础。
    今年的农田水利工作有那些经验应该重视和推广呢？可分三个问题来谈：
    一、依靠群众、因地制宜是开展群众性农田水利工作的主要关键
    推广水车、开挖和整修水井是北方解决干旱问题保障农作物丰产的最可靠的办法。新中国成立两年来，由于中央及各地人民政府的重视，水车水井事业已经迅速发展；特别是新设计的、轻便的解放式管子水车，已受到全国各地农民的热烈欢迎。目前水车灌田的地区，已不限在华北各省及山东；在陕西、甘肃、辽西、云南以及广东、新疆等省，从来没有使用或很少使用水车的地区，都表示今后要大量推广；河北、平原、山东、山西等省，大量推广已有显著成绩，对当地农业生产的恢复与提高，作用极大。从一九四九年末到现在，全国新添的和修复的水车共约二十一万辆，相当于抗日战争以前原有水车总数的三分之二。这是人民政府在短短两年时间内，对翻身农民的最切实的帮助之一。因此，各地农民异口同声感谢共产党、毛主席和人民政府对他们的关怀。今年在水车方面的主要问题是生产不及时和出贷以前的调查研究工作不够，这是各地今后必须注意的。在开挖和整修水井方面，今年一般进行得还好。在平原、陕西、皖北几个地区，打井抗旱得到了显著成效。平原省冠县有一个村庄，全村二百五十六户中，有二百五十户参加了打井运动，共打成新井十九眼。平原省其他专署和县也都以共产党员、青年团员为骨干，分别串连地邻组织打井互助组。很多地方还以县为单位组织打井技术委员会，解决具体的技术困难。陕西省在西北大行政区和省的党和政府主要负责同志领导下，组织了各级“棉田丰产防旱委员会”，在一个多月的时间内完成打井五万多眼的突击任务。皖北行政区阜阳专区在防汛抗旱指挥部领导下，一个专区就打井五万七千二百二十七眼，对防旱起了决定性作用。山东省早已获得良好成效的洋灰筒井，成本比砖筒井低，明年其他地区也可以试验推广。今年在开挖和整修水井方面的主要问题，是某些地区的各级领导机关重视不够，没有设立专职干部和机构，因而工作还呈现自流状态。
    在江南塘坝灌溉地区，各省贯彻了依靠农民群众兴修水利的方针，都超计划地完成了任务。西南区今年原计划修整小型水利扩大灌溉面积一百万亩，结果完成了二百零一万亩。中南区今年兴修小型水利占全部农田水利工程的百分之九十九点七，仅湖南一省农民就出工三千七百五十九万个，挖掘土方一亿立方公尺，修好塘坝五十多万处，因而全省稻谷得到丰收。华东区农民群众自力兴办的工程也占工程总数的百分之九十八点四。目前主要困难是某些领导机关对情况了解不够，因之往往落后于农民群众的要求，工作被动。今年浙江省余姚县召集了各乡熟悉当地水利情况的积极分子开会，弄清了全县的水利情况，打好今后发展的基础。山西省水利局最近也召开了全省水利代表会。因为参加这个会的代表都是由各县农民群众选举的，所以，这个会是真正联系群众的会议。这种召开水利能手代表会议的方式，明年可以大力推行。在加强农民群众基层组织方面，皖南行政区和浙江省都已广泛建立起区乡村的农田水利委员会或塘坝工程委员会等组织。事实证明，这是开展工作解决组织领导问题的有效措施。在今年农田水利工作中普遍发生的现象是工程质量不高。目前，群众性水利工作范围日渐扩大，个别地区甚至已形成数村数乡甚至全县的联合行动。在这种情况下，怎样很快地把农民组织和领导起来，如何使技术及时赶上农民群众的需要，提高工程质量（包括加大蓄水量），就成了今后各地应该严重注意的问题。
    总之，在目前的经济情况下，大力领导各地农民，因地制宜地开展各种群众性的农田水利工作是完全适宜的，也是完全必要的。各地农田水利领导机关应把这当作工作重点之一。
    二、加强灌溉管理、发挥现有水利设施的潜在能力是扩大浇地面积提高产量的基本措施
    从去年春天中央开始注意改革灌溉的管理制度以后，各地灌溉区一般都进行了一次民主改革，这是改善灌溉管理制度的必要前提。只有把这个工作做好，然后才能说到建立民主机构，消除纠纷，扩大浇地面积，最后达到合理灌溉的目的。绥远省在进行减租减息、剿灭土匪、肃清特务和镇压反革命等中心工作的同时，注意了灌溉区管理制度的改革工作。这个省过去所有的水利管理组织完全掌握在地主恶霸手里，每年水利纠纷层出不穷，甚至还引起汉族蒙族人民间的仇恨；今年这个省加强了对农民的思想教育，并发动农民群众把旧的为地主阶级所掌握的管理机构推翻，改由人民群众自己选举的水利委员会来管理。山西省在实行灌溉区的民主改革后，又在各大河系和二十三个水利重点县选举了水利代表四千多人，用代表会议的形式来领导和推动全盘工作，改变了旧日残存的多种不合理制度，扩大了浇地面积一百八十四万亩。平原省新乡专区注意了对农民的政治思想动员，改善渠道管理，按季节、按地亩、按田禾适量配水，结果使每一秒立方公尺的水量浇到二万六千亩土地。陕西省各公营渠道改选了管理用水的人员，并由农业水利机关和群众代表成立灌溉委员会，个别渠道还成立灌溉示范区，泾惠渠的某些支渠并采用了按农作物种类和种植面积“按成分次”给水的办法，得到农民群众热烈拥护，保障了今年棉麦的收成。东北区注意培养了一批渠道管理人员，个别县还专门添设了水利助理员，部分地区实行了“浅水灌溉”，开始注意了改进耕作法和作物需水量的试验，收到了扩大浇地节约用水的初步成效。江南各省在对管理塘坝中，也开始注意节省水量，减少用水纠纷，提高蓄水效能。苏南行政区改善了对抽水机的管理，组织了私营戽水商，消除了封建水头的中间剥削，保障了二百五十万亩稻田的生产，也是管理上的一项收获。此外，广东省机械灌溉的发展和管理也有很多成绩。
    今年的农田水利工作虽有了以上的成绩，但是目前仍有严重的问题。首先是某些农田水利机关和工作人员重工程轻管理的思想和用水制度虽然开始有些改变，但是如何提高和发挥原有各种灌溉设施的利用率仍是一个大问题。第二，不少灌溉区的干部还有严重的本位主义思想。有些区村以至县、专区的干部，往往受一部分农民落后的保守的自私思想的影响，作了群众的尾巴，不能正确地分清整体利益和部分利益，以至使水利工作无法进一步发展。今后我们要加强“天下农民是一家”和“全面观点”的互助互让教育，并对一切灌溉地区做一次普查，彻底肃清封建残余的旧有用水规章，彻底改造原有的管理人员，严格纠正宗派主义的本位主义的思想和作法。第三，对用水管理与农业生产技术截然分割的观点也必须纠正。今年黑龙江省有些水田受益反而低于旱田，这是不合理的。许多地区对于灌溉的基本理论了解不够，大量用水，引碱上升，使土地碱化。这些都要在今后认真改善。第四，有些地区对渠道管理不采取企业经营的方针，少收水费，有单纯恩赐观点，这也妨碍了农田水利事业的正常发展。
    今后，我们应该针对以上问题，按照中央人民政府农业部和水利部发布的关于灌溉管理的联合指示，把这项工作做好，为将来大规模的近代化的农田水利工程的管理与使用打下基础。
    三、有重点地审慎地兴修大型灌溉工程是逐步增加农业生产的一个重要保证
    今年全国各地一共兴修了大型灌溉、排水工程九十多处，预计受益面积可以达到三百万亩。东北区今年仍继续恢复东辽河、查哈阳、郭前旗、盘山四大灌溉区，及黑龙江省的平安、双河等小型灌溉区的工程。山西省滹沱河、潇河两大工程，经过一年的努力，已完成的工程，可浇地三十万亩。察哈尔省的桑乾河淤灌工程，今年前后淤灌总面积达十八万亩，超过本年原计划淤灌十五万亩的任务。察哈尔省今年连遭风、雹、旱、冻等灾害，平均年景只有三成左右，而灌溉区内虽然也受了冻灾，却不下五成年景。所以农民群众都说：“我们在共产党领导下办好水渠，子子孙孙不会受穷了。”国营汉沽农场，今年做好了一万二千亩的水利工程。陕西省的洛惠渠注意了挖斗渠工作，在两个月的时间内完成了四百五十公里的渠道和六百多座大小建筑物，因之从去年灌田面积五万亩增加到二十四万亩。皖南行政区今年兴办的易太圩机械排水工程（公私合资经营的），在七月间严重内涝的情况下，起了极大作用，保证三万多亩稻田的常年产量，估计今后每年至少增产稻谷三百万斤。广东省的台山禾雀陂灌溉工程，在国民党反动统治时期曾三建三毁，整个灌溉系统荒废；现在在人民政府领导下，有了正确的规划设计，行政、技术、群众密切配合，顺利地完成了任务。川西著名的都江堰岁修工程，今年挖河土方一百二十多万立方公尺，等于十年来挖河土方的总数；另外增填土方五十三万立方公尺，装竹笼二十多万条，动员人工将近三十七万。这样大规模地整修之后，保障了三百万亩良田的丰收。
    今后在工程建设上，值得普遍注意的问题，是如何做好灌溉系统的整体规划问题。不少地区还只是注意取水设施的研究，而忽视了有关配水、用水和配合耕作等问题的计划。因此就使灌溉区不能充分受益和迅速受益，同时又易于造成工程上的浪费。另外，在今年大型工程上普遍存在的规划设计不周密、标准低以及过分浪费工料的现象，需要继续改进。
    一九五二年的农田水利工程建设，更应审慎从事，提高现有工程的质量。我们的领导人员和技术人员；更应接受“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”的教育，改正我们的缺点和错误，为满足国家和人民的期望，为扩大灌溉面积、保证提高农业生产的单位面积产量而努力。
