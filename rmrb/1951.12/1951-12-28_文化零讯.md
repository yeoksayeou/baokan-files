    ▲ The People's Government of Xikang Province and the People's Administrative Office of Southern Sichuan organized medical teams to go to the Greater and Lesser Liangshan areas to treat the Yi people. From May to November this year, the medical teams have successively treated approximately 20,000 people.

All special districts, except for Zhenyuan and Zunyi, have established ethnic medical and epidemic prevention teams, specializing in the prevention and treatment of epidemics for ethnic minority people. Hospitals in various special districts and counties have also begun to provide free medical treatment to ethnic minority people. Zhenyuan, Bijie and other special districts have also opened training classes for ethnic minority health personnel, helping various ethnic groups train a large number of health cadres. This autumn, the Guizhou Province Land Reform Health Work Team also helped various regions train more than 1,540 ethnic minority primary health workers and midwives.
    ▲ The news and publishing undertakings of various ethnic minorities in Northwest China have greatly developed. Over the past two years, Northwest China has planned and focused on establishing and improving newspapers in seventeen ethnic minority languages, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Tibetan, Mongolian, Xibe, and Russian, at the levels of the Greater Administrative Area, the province, and the special district. According to incomplete statistics, the total circulation of newspapers in various ethnic minority languages has reached more than 200,000 copies. Various localities have also published a large number of Chairman Mao's works and various policies and regulations promulgated by the Central People's Government in various ethnic minority languages. In Xinjiang Province alone, more than 800,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works and various policy and regulatory books have been published in ethnic minority languages.
