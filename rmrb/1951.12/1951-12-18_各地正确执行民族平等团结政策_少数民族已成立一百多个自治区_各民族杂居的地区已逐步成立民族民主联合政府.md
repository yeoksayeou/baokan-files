Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: In the past two years, local people's governments have correctly implemented the policy of ethnic equality and unity. Some minority ethnic areas have initially implemented ethnic regional autonomy or established ethnic democratic united governments.

As of now, in addition to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was established earlier, ethnic autonomous regions have been established in the Northwest, Southwest, and Central South regions. In the eastern part of Xikang Province, a Tibetan Autonomous Region encompassing twenty counties has been established. Vast areas inhabited by Mongolians, such as the Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League in Suiyuan Province, have also implemented regional autonomy. The Yi people of the Greater Liang Mountains, who were isolated from the outside world during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, have also begun to establish an ethnic autonomous region in the Zhaojue area. In addition, a Hui Autonomous Region has been established in the city of Gui Sui. In total, more than 100 ethnic autonomous regions, ranging from the special district level to the township level, have been established throughout the country. The ethnicities in the autonomous regions include Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Miao, Yi, Yao, Dongxiang, and sparsely populated ethnicities such as the Oroqen.

Ethnic democratic united governments have been gradually established in areas with mixed ethnic populations. According to recent statistics, there are eleven special district-level ethnic democratic united governments, fifty-three county (city)-level governments, twenty-seven district-level governments, and seventy-two township-level governments in the Southwest region. In the Northwest region, it is very common for minority ethnic representatives to participate in government work and hold important positions in places with mixed ethnic populations. In the Central South region, the Longsheng County of Guangxi Province has established an ethnic democratic united government. In addition, the people's government also gives special consideration to people of minority ethnic groups scattered throughout various areas, paying attention to absorbing their representatives to participate in local governments, and earnestly ensuring their equal rights.

When establishing ethnic regional autonomous governments and ethnic democratic united governments in various regions, people's representative conferences are generally held first. Combining these with the central tasks of the area, the ethnic policy of unity and cooperation is promoted, democracy is developed, and translation work is done well so that representatives of all ethnic groups can reflect the hopes and demands of all ethnic people as much as possible. In the election of government committee members, all aspects such as ethnicity, region, population, and occupation are generally taken into account, and special consideration is given to ethnic groups with small populations, so that repeated deliberation and consultation are carried out to ensure that the opinions of all ethnic groups are consistent. The ethnic autonomous governments and ethnic democratic united governments established through such procedures have a foundation of democratic cooperation.

Experience has shown that in areas where ethnic regional autonomy has been implemented and ethnic democratic united governments have been established, the political consciousness of the local minority people has been significantly improved, thereby strengthening ethnic unity and promoting various tasks. For example, after the establishment of the Xichang Special District Ethnic Democratic United Government and the Zhaojue County Yi Autonomous Region in Xikang Province, the "revenge killings" that had occurred within the Yi ethnic group for many years were basically stopped. More than 1,700 disputes were mediated, and old enemies from several generations reconciled. After the establishment of the Xinping County Ethnic Democratic United Government in Yunnan Province, local production work was greatly promoted. In a short period of time, the people of all ethnic groups in the county repaired 74 ditches, built 9 dams, and planted more than 1,200 mu of cotton. In the Tianzhu Autonomous Region of Gansu Province, although the entire region has a population of only over 30,000 people, it completed the plan of donating an aircraft six months ahead of schedule in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. In areas where ethnic regional autonomy has been implemented and ethnic democratic united governments have been established, minority ethnic cadres are constantly increasing due to the development of work.

    各地正确执行民族平等团结政策
    少数民族已成立一百多个自治区
    各民族杂居的地区已逐步成立民族民主联合政府
    【新华社十四日讯】两年来，各地人民政府正确执行民族平等团结的政策，若干少数民族地区已初步实行民族区域自治或建立了民族民主联合政府。
    截至目前止，除内蒙古自治区早已建立外，西北、西南、中南各地区都已成立了民族自治区。西康省东部成立了包括二十个县的藏族自治区。绥远省伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟等蒙族聚居的广大地区，也实行了区域自治。在国民党反动统治时代，和外界隔绝的大凉山彝族人民，也已开始在昭觉地区建立了民族自治区。此外，在城市中，归绥市成立了一个回民自治区。总计，全国各地已成立少数民族自治区的，从专区级到乡级，共有一百多个。自治区的民族包括蒙、藏、回、苗、彝、瑶、东乡和人口很少的鄂伦春等民族。
    各民族杂居的地区，已逐步成立民族民主联合政府。据最近统计，西南区专区级的民族民主联合政府有十一个，县（市）级的有五十三个，区级的有二十七个，乡级的有七十二个。在西北区，各民族杂居的地方少数民族人士参加政府工作、担任重要职务的非常普遍。在中南区，广西省龙胜县已建立了民族民主联合政府。此外，人民政府还特别照顾散居在各处的少数民族成分的人民，注意吸收他们的代表人物参加当地政权，切实保障他们的平等权利。
    各地在建立民族区域自治政府和民族民主联合政府时，一般都先召开人民代表会议，结合当地的中心工作，宣传团结合作的民族政策，发扬民主，并做好翻译工作，使各族代表能尽量地反映各族人民的希望和要求。在选举政府委员的工作上，一般都照顾了民族、地区、人口、职业等各个方面，并特别照顾到人口很少的民族，做到反复酝酿协商，使各民族的意见一致起来。通过这样的程序建立起来的民族自治区人民政府和民族民主联合政府，便都有了民主合作的基础。
    经验证明：凡是实行了民族区域自治和建立了民族民主联合政府的地区，当地少数民族人民的政治觉悟都显著提高，从而加强了民族团结，推动了各种工作。如西康省西昌专区民族民主联合政府和昭觉县彝族自治区成立后，基本上停止了彝族内部多年来的“打冤家”事件，调解了一千七百多件纠纷案件，几代的老冤家也和好了。云南省新平县民族民主联合政府成立后，大大地推动了当地的生产工作。在短时期内，该县各民族人民共修理沟渠七十四条，建筑堤坝九座，植棉一千二百亩以上。甘肃省天祝自治区，全区人口虽只有三万多人，在抗美援朝运动中也提前完成了半年捐献战斗机一架的计划。在已经实行民族区域自治和建立了民族民主联合政府的地区，由于工作发展，少数民族干部也正不断地增加。
