    The Entire Staff of the Steelmaking Department of Northwest Steel Company
    Enthusiastically Challenge to Launch a Production Increase and Economy Drive
    The entire staff of the Steelmaking Department of Northwest Steel Company enthusiastically responds to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." During the democratic reform movement, the staff of the Steelmaking Department of Northwest Steel Company proposed 84 rationalization suggestions, more than 30 of which received bonuses, saving the country wealth worth 540 million yuan.
    Recently, Comrade Wang Guiying, a labor model in the Steelmaking Department, returned to the factory after attending the Shanxi Provincial Labor Model Conference, conveying to everyone the significance of increasing production and practicing economy and the situation of the production increase and economy drive across the country. The staff launched a heated discussion on this communication. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would actively respond to Chairman Mao's call and maintain the glorious title of the Steelmaking Department in the past. The comrades in charge of the gas furnace launched a furnace repair movement, completing the task, which was expected to take half a month, victoriously in twelve days, saving more than 8 million yuan. The Steelmaking Department’s groups have also successively launched challenges, formulated specific production increase and economy plans, and ensured that they would complete the 1951 production tasks ahead of schedule as a gift to Chairman Mao for the 1952 New Year's Day.

    西北钢铁公司炼钢部全体职工
    热烈挑战开展增产节约运动
    西北钢铁公司炼钢部全体职工，热烈响应毛主席关于“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召。西北钢铁公司炼钢部职工在民主改革运动中，曾提出合理化建议八十四条，其中有三十多条都获得奖金，为国家节省了价值五亿四千万元的财富。
    最近，炼钢部劳动模范王贵英同志，参加山西省劳动模范大会后回到厂内，向大家传达了增产节约的意义和全国各地开展增产节约运动的情况。职工们对这一传达展开了热烈的讨论。大家一致表示要积极响应毛主席的号召，保持炼钢部过去的光荣称号。负责煤气炉的同志，展开了修炉运动，预计半月完成的任务，十二天就胜利完成，节省了八百多万元。炼钢部各组又纷纷展开挑战，拟订具体的增产节约计划，并保证提前完成一九五一年的生产任务，作为一九五二年元旦给毛主席的献礼。
