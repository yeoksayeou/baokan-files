The "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries of the People's Republic of China," published by the East China People's Publishing House, achieved a new record of nine million copies printed in three months (from May to August of this year); in the East China region alone, approximately 5.7 million copies were distributed during this period. (Editor's Note: According to the 30th issue of the "Publishing Weekly" of the East China People's Publishing House, as of November 29th, the total number of copies printed had reached 10,425,000). The experience of publishing and distributing this book is worthy of attention and learning from all regions.

The tremendous success of this popular booklet is primarily due to its publication being closely linked to the central tasks of the nation. When the book was published in late May, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was being vigorously carried out throughout East China, and the book precisely met the urgent needs of the broad masses. Secondly, the publication and distribution of the book were carried out under the leadership and with the assistance of local Party committees and governments, through careful planning, close reliance on the masses, extensive organization of social distribution forces, and full mobilization of working cadres. In the process, a series of good methods were created.

The serious and conscientious nature of the editing work is a characteristic of this book. In early May, the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CCP instructed the East China People's Publishing House to compile a popular reading material explaining the Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries. The specific requirements were: each article should be followed by an explanation as simple as possible, and should include illustrations. The East China People's Publishing House completed the book on May 12th and submitted it for review. In order to review and revise the original manuscript, the East China Bureau Propaganda Department convened a special meeting, inviting comrades from the East China Military and Political Committee's Public Security Department, People's Court, Culture Department, and the East China People's Publishing House to participate. The meeting conducted a clause-by-clause discussion. More than half of the initial draft was rewritten based on the opinions raised during the meeting. After the revisions, the draft was submitted to the responsible comrades of the Propaganda Department for review, and revised again before being sent for typesetting. Before printing, the responsible comrades of the Propaganda Department reviewed the proofs. This spirit of seriousness and responsibility on the part of the local Party committee guaranteed the correctness of the book's political content and improved the work of the local publishing house. An editorial in the Soviet Union's Pravda on August 18th of this year pointed out: "The publishing workers of the Soviet Union's publishing bureaus are carrying out huge and important political tasks. They have the right to obtain constant help and concrete leadership from the Party organization. Local Party organizations should always lead the activities of the various publishing bureaus, guiding their work..." The East China Bureau Propaganda Department's assistance in the editing of this book provides an example in this regard, which should be emulated by Party committees and publishing houses in all regions.

The editors and illustrators of this book included three institutions: the East China People's Publishing House, the Liberation Daily, and the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Association of Fine Arts Workers. The experience of bringing together the strength of several institutions to collectively compile key reading materials is also important. Local publishing houses can identify several key reading materials in each period of work and organize forces from all aspects to jointly compile them. This will ensure the quality of the key reading materials.

This book not only achieved complete political correctness but also met the requirements of being popular in terms of content and form. After each article of the Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, the book first provides a general and concise explanation, pointing out the central meaning of the article; then comes a clear "definition of terms," with phonetic transcriptions for relatively unfamiliar words; and finally, illustrations are drawn according to the content of the article. This method of compilation can reduce the reading difficulties of people with limited literacy skills and help them understand the central content and basic spirit of the regulations. This is indeed a successful experience in compiling popular reading materials. After the book was published, it was immediately enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses. They responded that the book was good in both meaning and illustrations. Some farmers who did not originally recognize or understand certain words and phrases in the Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries (such as "unrepentant despite repeated offenses") found answers after reading this book.

The publication of a good book, of course, does not mean that all the work is completed. If the distribution work is not done well, it will not be able to fulfill its due role. In this regard, "proactive distribution, focusing on key areas" is an important experience. This is the final central link in publishing work. This link also relied on the promotion of Party committees at all levels and the cooperation and assistance of various social forces. The East China Bureau Propaganda Department specifically sent a telegram to notify Party committees at all levels to assist in the promotion. In addition to cooperating with the industry, post offices, and sales agents, Xinhua Bookstore branches throughout East China mobilized cadres at all levels in districts and villages and various rural organizations in rural areas through local Party committees, and in cities through trade unions, public security bureaus, Communist Youth League, Democratic Women's Federation, Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other organizations, schools, groups, libraries, and reading groups, forming a large army of propaganda and sales. The working cadres of the Xinhua Bookstore branches also displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, using various methods to carry out sales. Jiang Chiqian of the Shanghai Branch Service Section went deep into the neighborhoods on Sundays to promote and sell, selling more than 1,000 copies in one morning, and mobilized her mother to sell about 100 copies in the neighborhood. In Zhangzhu District, Yixing, most of which is mountainous, comrades from the branch carried books up the mountains, staying overnight in grass sheds. In some places, the water flooded to their knees, but it did not affect their work, and their enthusiasm was very high.

In addition, attention was paid to publicity work in the distribution of this book. Many salespersons correctly explained the political significance of reading the book to the masses, resulting in large sales. The low price also helped the book's sales. (After careful calculation, the East China People's Publishing House set the price very low, only eight hundred yuan per copy.) The masses responded: "I only need to smoke one less pack of cigarettes to buy a copy." Some women said: "As long as my chickens lay two more eggs, it will be enough."

Due to the above reasons, the number of copies sold reached such a high record. In some cities, on average, one copy for every five people; in the southern Jiangsu region, on average, one copy for every eleven people; in two townships in the Chengnan District of Feixi County in northern Anhui, some families bought one copy for every two families, and some families bought one copy for each family, averaging less than one copy for every three families.

The political effect of this book can be seen from the following responses. A rural woman said: "In the past, when I saw the People's Liberation Army (referring to the People's Government) killing special agents, I would say that the People's Liberation Army is good at everything, but killing people is not good. After reading this book, I felt that they had to be killed, because the special agents are too bad." Chen Kuaiying, a learning model in Tang Village, Ninth District, Nanling County, southern Anhui, said: "After reading this booklet, I understood the policies and learned some culture; the People's Government is really serving the people." Cadres also said that the book was helpful to them, such as Wu Zhiping, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Chaohe Village, Chengnan District, Feixi County, northern Anhui, who said: "In the past, I did not understand the national laws. Only after reading this book did I understand, and only then did I dare to publicize to the masses."

The distribution work of this book was not carried out in isolation, but was linked to the political tasks of the Party and the government and the political activities of mass organizations. This not only popularized the political education power of this book to the broad masses, but also expanded the regular distribution relations of the distribution organizations and opened up many new distribution routes, thereby also arousing the masses' concern and demand for the popular reading publication industry. A woman in northern Jiangsu bought this book and went to the bookstore the next day, clamoring for an illustrated version of the Marriage Law (Editor's Note: The East China People's Publishing House has now published an "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law"). Farmers requested that agricultural production policies, production knowledge, and health knowledge be compiled into illustrations, and requested the publication of textbooks such as "Picture Reading and Literacy." Some women requested the publication of "Women's Letters," to help them learn to write letters so that they would no longer have to ask others to write for them when corresponding with their husbands who had joined the army.

All of this proves that the future of the popular reading publication work for workers and peasants is extremely broad. The idea of ​​looking down on this work, thinking that the publication of popular reading materials is not worth the effort, thinking that books on policies and laws are not easily accepted by the masses, or emphasizing "peasants have low culture, peasants have no money, peasants have no reading habits" and therefore unwilling to face the countryside is wrong. The distribution results of this book are the most powerful evidence. (The most prominent example is: Fujian initially only planned to distribute 20,000 copies, but later sold more than 600,000 copies.) Today, the publication of popular reading materials is far behind the needs of the masses. The national publishing and distribution institutions should pay attention to studying how to compile publications with correct content and popular forms, how to maximize the effectiveness of illustrations in popular reading materials, how to make the text simple and easy to understand, how to proactively deliver publications that the masses can accept and are happy to accept to the masses, and how to establish regular and close contact with the masses in key distribution work. In local publishing houses, it is particularly necessary to make the publication of popular reading materials a top priority.

    一本创造发行新纪录的通俗读物
    ——介绍“惩治反革命条例图解通俗本”的编辑发行经验
    华东人民出版社出版的“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例图解通俗本”一书，在三个月（本年五月至八月）之内，总印数达到了九百万册的新纪录；单是华东区在此期间内就发行了约五百七十万册（编者按：据华东人民出版社“出版周报”第三十期载，截至十一月二十九日止，本书总印数已达一千零四十二万五千册）。这本书的出版发行工作的经验，值得各地重视和学习。
    这本通俗的小册子能够获得这样巨大的成绩，首先是由于它的出版密切地结合了国家的中心任务。当五月下旬这本书出版的时候，镇压反革命运动正在华东各地大张旗鼓地进行，这本书就正好适应了广大群众的迫切需要。其次，是由于这本书的出版发行工作都是在地方党委和政府的领导与帮助下，经过周密的布置，紧密依靠群众，广泛地组织了社会发行力量，充分动员了工作干部来完成的，在工作过程中并创造了一系列的好的方法。
    编辑工作的严肃认真，是这本书的特色。五月初，中共中央华东局宣传部要华东人民出版社编写一本关于解释惩治反革命条例的通俗读物。具体的要求是：在每一条条文后面要有尽可能通俗的说明，并且要有图解。华东人民出版社在五月十二日把这本书编好送审。为了审查和修改原稿，华东局宣传部特地召开了一次专门会议，邀集华东军政委员会公安部、人民法院、文化部和华东人民出版社的同志参加，在会上作了逐条逐句的讨论。初稿中一半以上的篇幅，根据会议中提出的意见，重新改写过。改写以后，再送给宣传部负责同志审查，又重新改过一道，然后付排。在付印之前，又由宣传部负责同志看了清样。地方党委机关这种严肃负责的精神保证了这本书的政治内容的正确，提高了地方出版社的工作。苏联真理报今年八月十八日的一篇社论曾经这样指出：“苏联各出版局的出版工作者执行着巨大的、重要的政治任务。他们有权取得党组织方面的经常帮助和具体领导。地方党组织应该时刻领导各个出版局的活动，指导它们的工作……。”华东局宣传部帮助本书的编辑工作，在这方面提供了一个范例，各地党委机关和出版社都应该学习。
    本书的编绘者包括了华东人民出版社、解放日报社、中华全国美术工作者协会上海分会三个机构。集合几个机构的力量来集体编写重点读物，这一经验也很重要。各地出版社在每一时期的工作中，都可以定出几种重点读物，组织各方面的力量来共同编写。这样就可以保证重点读物应有的质量。
    这本书不但在政治上做到了完全正确，也在内容形式上达到了通俗的要求。书中在惩治反革命条例的每一条条文后面，先作总的扼要的说明，指出本条的中心意思；然后是浅明的“字义解释”，较生僻的字还有注音；再后是按照条文内容绘制的图画。这样的编法，是可以减少识字不多的人的阅读困难，帮助他们了解条例的中心内容和基本精神的。这确是编写通俗读物的成功经验。这本书出版后，立刻受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。他们反应：这本书不但意思好，图画也好。有一些农民原来不认识、不懂得惩治反革命条例中的某些字和辞（如“怙恶不悛”），看了这本书之后，也得到解答了。
    一本好书出版了，当然不等于一切工作都完成了。若不做好发行工作，还是不能尽到它应有的作用的。在这方面，“主动发行，重点发行”是重要的经验。这是出版工作最后的一个中心环节。这一个环节也是依靠了各级党委的推动和各种社会力量的配合协助的。华东局宣传部曾特地发出电报，通知各级党委协助推广。新华书店华东各地分支店除了联合同业、邮局、代销处外，在城市就通过工会、公安局、青年团、民主妇联、工商联合会及其他机关、学校、团体、图书室、读报组，在农村就通过地方党委动员区乡村各级干部和各种农村组织，组成了一支宣传推销大军。新华书店各分支店的工作干部也发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，利用各种方式进行推销。上海分店服务科蒋炽倩在星期日深入里弄宣传推销，一个上午销出一千余册，并动员她母亲在里弄中推销了约一百册。宜兴的张渚区大部分是山路，支店同志们挑着书爬山，夜里宿在草棚里，有的地方水淹到膝盖，都没有影响工作，热情很高。
    此外，在本书的发行工作中，注意了宣传工作。许多推销员向群众正确地说明了阅读本书的政治意义，收到了大量销行的效果。而定价低廉也帮助了本书的销行。（华东人民出版社经过仔细计算，把价格定得很低，每册仅八百元。）群众反应：“我只要少抽一包烟就能买一本。”有的妇女说：“只要我的鸡多生两个蛋就行了。”
    由于上面这些原因，这本书的发行数量才达到了如此高的纪录。有些城市，平均五人有一本；苏南区平均每十一个人有一本；皖北肥西县城南区的两个乡，有的两家买一本，有的一家买一本，平均起来不到三家也有一本。
    这本书所起的政治作用，可以从下面一些反应中看出来。一个农村妇女说：“过去我看到解放军
    （指人民政府）杀特务，我就说解放军什么都好，就是杀人不好。这次看完这本书，觉得是要杀，因为特务太坏了。”皖南南陵县第九区塘村的学习模范陈快英说：“看了这个小本子，懂了政策又学了文化；人民政府真会替人民办事。”干部也说这本书对他们有帮助，如皖北肥西县城南区巢河村农会主席吴志平说：“过去自己对国家法律不了解，看到这本书才懂了，自己才敢向群众宣传。”
    这本书的发行工作，不是孤立进行而是同党和政府的政治任务，群众团体的政治活动相联系的，这就不但使这本书的政治教育力量普及到广大群众中，而且也使发行机构扩展了经常的发行关系，开辟了许多新的发行路线，从而也引起群众对通俗读物出版事业的关心和要求。苏北一个妇女买了这本书后，隔了一天就到书店去，吵着要求编一本婚姻法图解（编者按：华东人民出版社现已出版了一本“婚姻法图解通俗本”）。农民要求把农业生产政策、生产知识、卫生常识编成图解，要求出版“看图识字”一类的课本。有的妇女要求出版“妇女尺牍”，帮助自己学习写信，以便在跟参军的丈夫通信时，不再请人代笔。
    这一切都证明了工农群众通俗读物出版工作的前途是极其广阔的。那种看不起这种工作，认为通俗读物的出版工作不值得费大力气去做，认为属于政策法令方面的书不易为群众所接受，或强调“农民文化低，农民没有钱，农民没有读书习惯”因而不愿面向农村的想法是错误的。这一本书的发行成绩就是最有力的证据。（最突出的例子是：福建最初只打算发行二万册，后来却销售了六十万册以上。）今天通俗读物的出版工作，是远远落后于群众的需要的。国家的出版机构和发行机构，应该注意研究怎样编写内容正确、形式通俗的出版物，怎样在通俗读物中尽量发挥图画的效用，怎样使文字浅显易懂，怎样把群众所能接受而且乐于接受的出版物主动地送到群众手里，怎样在重点发行工作中建立起经常的、密切联系群众的发行关系。在地方出版社中，尤须把做好通俗读物的出版工作列为首要任务。
