    We Must Pay Attention to Workers' Rationalization Proposals

    The administrative leaders of the Beijing Tap Water Company and the Tap Water Plant do not value the rationalization proposals of the workers, hindering the in-depth development of the production increase and economy campaign in the Tap Water Plant. The reason they do not value the rationalization proposals of the workers is that they have two erroneous ideas: one is a purely task-oriented view of work, so they turn a blind eye to new things coming from the masses. They believe that only the work of clearing assets and verifying funds is important at present, and it doesn't matter if they ignore the rationalization proposals of the masses. In fact, the purpose of clearing assets and verifying funds is completely consistent with the purpose of the workers' proposals on economy, and there is no contradiction at all. Clearing assets and verifying funds is a specific task stipulated by the higher authorities, so it should naturally be completed with all efforts. However, it should be pointed out that carefully studying and accepting the rationalization proposals of the workers is also an important task for production leaders, and it is a task that should be paid attention to regularly. If they don't even care about the rationalization proposals actively put forward by the workers, how can they talk about "relying on the working class to run the people's enterprises well"? Can administrative leaders do a good job in clearing assets and verifying funds if they ignore the power of the masses in this way? Obviously impossible.

    Another wrong idea is that they think their technology is high, so they look down on the rationalization proposals of the workers. Where is this high technology? It is just a stumbling block that hinders the progress of the masses and the development of production. Some workers in the Tap Water Plant have already put forward very meaningful rationalization proposals, but the administrative leaders ignore them, which is a prominent example of blocking the wisdom of the masses and hindering production improvement.

    Both of the above attitudes toward rationalization proposals will hinder the development of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The Party organizations, trade unions, and administrative leaders in the factory must launch an uncompromising struggle against these two erroneous ideas!

### 必须重视工人的合理化建议

    必须重视工人的合理化建议
    北京市自来水公司和自来水厂行政领导干部，不重视工人的合理化建议，妨碍了自来水厂增产节约运动的深入开展。他们不重视工人的合理化建议的原因，是他们有两种错误的思想：一是对工作有单纯任务观点，因此，对来自群众中的新东西熟视无睹。他们认为当前只有清理资产核定资金工作要紧，对群众的合理化建议不管不问也没关系。其实，清理资产核定资金的目的和工人群众提出关于节约的合理化建议的目的是完全一致的，一点矛盾也没有。清理资产核定资金是上级具体规定的任务，自然应当尽力完成。可是，应当指出：认真研究和接受工人群众的合理化建议，也是生产领导者的一项重要任务，而且是要经常注意的任务。如果连工人积极提出的合理化建议都不关心，还谈什么“依靠工人阶级办好人民企业”呢？行政领导干部这样忽视群众的力量，能不能把清理资产核定资金工作做好呢？显然是不可能的。
    另外一种错误思想，是认为自己的技术高，因而瞧不起工人的合理化建议。这种技术高在那里呢？只不过是一种阻碍群众进步、阻碍生产发展的绊脚石而已。自来水厂有的工人已经提出了很有意义的合理化建议，行政领导干部却不理睬，这就是闭塞群众智慧、妨碍生产改进的一个突出的例子。
    以上两种对待合理化建议的态度，都会阻碍群众积极性和创造性的发挥。工厂里的党组织、工会和行政领导干部，都必须对这两种错误思想展开不妥协的斗争！
