The Beijing construction industry has greatly improved work efficiency by promoting the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method," which has rationally solved labor organization problems and implemented a scientific division of labor and responsibility system. In the past, a master worker (skilled worker) could lay 400 to 700 bricks a day; now, a master worker and a helper (non-technical worker assisting skilled workers) can lay 1,800 to 2,800 bricks. If a helper is considered equivalent to a master worker, the efficiency is equivalent to 200% of the original efficiency. If two helpers are considered equivalent to one master worker, the efficiency is equivalent to 280% of the original efficiency, while ensuring the quality of the project.

    Promoting the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method" on the Basis of Overthrowing the Feudal Foreman System

When Beijing's construction industry began to promote the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method" in September of this year, there were huge new construction tasks, a shortage of skilled workers, and unreasonable labor organization and utilization. Moreover, most construction companies had not completely abolished the feudal foreman system, and the city was launching a large-scale mass struggle against foremen. A few companies that had basically abolished the feudal foreman system had not yet fully established new production systems due to the lack of in-depth work by administrative and trade union cadres, and workers had conservative guild ideas. Therefore, mass production competitions had not yet been fully launched. Based on this situation, the Construction Trade Union Work Committee decided to first promote the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method" in eight construction sites belonging to the Construction Office directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the China Construction Enterprise Company, and the Renmin University Construction Institute, which had basically abolished the feudal foreman system, to pave the way for production work after the anti-foreman struggle. To this end, the Construction Office directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the China Construction Enterprise Company, and the Renmin University Construction Institute invited Su Changyou, a model worker representative from the Northeast region who participated in the National Day observation ceremony, to give five reports and three guidance exercises successively in the new urban area, Yuquan Mountain, and the Cultural Palace. This was supported by the broad masses of workers, praised by engineering technicians, and supported by leading cadres. However, a few technicians and some workers expressed doubts. They believed: "The walls in Guanli are narrow and the shapes are complex, so this method may not be applicable." Some people also said: "It's good, but it's not easy to use." A few old skilled workers with more conservative ideas even said contemptuously: "How old is he, how much experience does he have? Who wouldn't know this method!" In response to these ideological situations, the Construction Office directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the China Construction Enterprise Company, and the Renmin University Construction Institute all held meetings of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League to study promotion methods and establish specialized organizations to promote the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method." On the basis of workers' conscious voluntarism, the leadership adopted methods of calling for, signing up, reviewing, and approving to organize the first batch of Su Changyou-style bricklaying groups. They also conducted in-depth ideological education for the group members and stipulated the work steps of learning, mastering, and creating records. Some units even introduced the engineering structure and practice in detail before the experiment, so that each worker clearly knew his task and responsibilities and had a clear understanding. The results of the first day of the experiment were: the Construction Office directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, one master worker and one helper laid 1,500 bricks; the China Construction Enterprise Company, two master workers and two helpers laid 5,120 bricks; the Renmin University Construction Institute, one master worker and two helpers laid 2,700 bricks. They not only ensured the quality standards, but also exceeded the original work efficiency by about one and a half times in terms of quantity. As a result, workers' production enthusiasm was very high. That night, the leadership held a meeting to review the advantages and disadvantages of the work and plan, deploy, and improve the work for the next day. Later, this meeting became a system. Each group formulated a group patriotic pact, and some groups also signed master-apprentice contracts, presenting a new atmosphere in production. The kind of words that used to ridicule workers who worked actively were no longer heard. What is heard now is: "Why don't you organize us? Are we not active in our work?" The successful facts broke the original incorrect views of some technicians that "this method is only applicable to Guanwai, not to Guanli; only applicable to simple-shaped projects, not to complex-shaped projects," etc., giving everyone enough confidence to carry out this movement. Those master craftsmen with conservative technical ideas who were not very convinced of this method gradually learned to try this method. In these construction sites, there are now sixty-one groups using this new bricklaying method.

The results of these groups promoting the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method" prove the superiority of the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method."

    Achievements in Promoting the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method"

First, a system of scientific division of labor and dedicated responsibility was implemented in labor organization. In the past, workers in a shift were assigned to work in three or four places, and work was assigned temporarily, doing scattered individual work; laying bricks here today and there tomorrow. The workers did not have a clear understanding, listened to the team leader's instructions, and worked blindly. There was no production quota, doing as much as possible, and there was no concept of being responsible for the project. Some master workers and helpers waited for each other, and some work types competed in slowing down. Skilled workers operated non-technical labor (non-technical labor occupies two-thirds of a skilled worker's labor time), wasting manpower and time. After fixing the work location and work tasks, the workers had a clear understanding, and everyone could work consciously. Masters and apprentices helped each other, and work types promoted each other. Skilled workers do not do non-technical labor, and everyone is repeating simple work, reducing non-production time, and making it easier to improve proficiency. Therefore, a project originally planned to be completed by 170 master workers in two months, and still fearing that the task could not be completed, can now be guaranteed to be completed by only 40 master workers in the same time. According to preliminary statistics, a project of 750,000 bricks can save wages of 18.75 million yuan. Projects that used to require 1,735 helpers and 781 master workers can now be completed with 456 helpers and 152 master workers, while ensuring the quality of the project.

Second, the use of materials is saved. In the past, no one cared about the ash troughs being kicked down from the upstairs, and the ash and sand were greatly wasted; some bricklayers did not pick half-bricks, and some picked them but did not use them, and the loss rate of bricks was as high as 5% to 15%; now, according to the covenant, it has been achieved that "no ash is dropped, no broken bricks are left, the ground is clean, and it is guaranteed not to waste a shovel of ash or a brick." According to preliminary investigations, a project of 100,000 bricks can save one load of ash, and the loss rate of bricks is reduced to 1% to 5%.

Third, the relationship between masters and apprentices has been improved. In the past, there was no fixed master-apprentice relationship, and everyone was not responsible. Apprentices relied entirely on their own exploration, "unable to get on the wall for the first two years," and it took "three years and one season" to become a master. Now, after the formation of groups, apprentices are assigned to masters to lead them; this not only eliminates the old feudal relationship, but also enables apprentices to learn from masters at any time, help each other, and guarantee each other. They divide the bricklaying craft into one hundred types, and the master guarantees to teach the apprentice three types of crafts in ten days, and cares for the apprentice; the apprentice guarantees to learn, remember, work actively, and respect the master. As one apprentice said: "In the past, I couldn't learn one skill in two months, but now, in more than half a year, I can take a shovel and do work." In this way, the relationship between masters and apprentices has been improved, and the unity between workers and technicians has been strengthened.

Fourth, the trade union work has found a way to face production. In the past, trade union work could not grasp the center and was often busy in a mess. Group meetings were not held frequently, and the content was very monotonous, and workers were not interested in attending meetings; some administrative cadres felt that the trade union was dispensable, and workers reflected that "the trade union did not play a role." Now, trade union groups are established according to production groups, the trade union faces production, establishes a trade union work system, and enriches the content of trade union group life (such as reviewing the work of the day, discussing how to complete the work tasks for the next day, checking the implementation of master-apprentice contracts and safety issues, revising patriotic covenants, etc.). Workers come to the trade union for solutions when they have problems, and administrative cadres discuss matters with the trade union.

    Doing a good job of preparation is the key to smoothly promoting the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method"

Beijing's construction industry has gained preliminary experience in promoting the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method."

First, abolishing the foreman system and raising the awareness of the working masses are the basic conditions for the successful implementation of the "Su Changyou Work Method." If the foreman system exists, workers are in a state of oppression and cannot develop their labor enthusiasm and creativity. This is a problem that must be solved first in order to promote any innovative working method. The success of Beijing's promotion of the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method" this time is due to the selection of construction sites that have abolished the foreman system as pilot projects; in the process of promotion, the old labor organization was further changed, and the foundation of the foreman system was completely eradicated.

Second, to promote the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method," it is necessary to combine it with patriotic education, conduct full ideological mobilization and brewing, so that it becomes the masses' own requirements, and enable the masses to establish full confidence and determination to overcome difficulties and achieve victory. The facts of this promotion experiment tell us that groups that have been well mobilized and brewed have always been full of production enthusiasm, not afraid of external ridicule, blows, and difficulties in objective conditions, and have created new records. However, some administrative cadres only emphasized learning this working method and neglected to carry out labor education and political education for workers, and were eager for quick results. As a result, the quality and efficiency of the formed groups were not high enough, and some even collectively slowed down.

Third, leading cadres attach importance, personally take action, and absorb technicians to participate. Because the promotion of the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method" is a reform of labor organization in the construction industry, difficulties and problems will inevitably be encountered in the process of work; especially among construction workers with relatively serious guild conservative ideas, various ideological concerns and resistance will arise. In this promotion, the leading cadres of some units did not pay enough attention at the beginning, and as a result, they took detours and even failed. The leading cadres of some units attached importance to it at the beginning, but relaxed their leadership when it was universally promoted, and the results were not good. Therefore, it is necessary to have the active support of leading cadres from all aspects of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and personally take action and absorb technicians to participate, and promptly solve some new problems that occur in technology, in order to promote it smoothly.

Fourth, do a good job of preparing in all aspects, so that all work types can be organically coordinated. This is the key to the smooth promotion of the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method." Some units' administrative cadres did not plan enough and did not cooperate well, so after the efficiency of the bricklayers was improved, the raw materials could not be supplied; the scaffolders could not climb up, and some bricklayers built their own scaffolds, resulting in injuries; some could not find technicians and used shoulder poles instead of rulers to measure windows, resulting in rework after the masonry was completed; even more, some administrative cadres did not fully prepare plans and did not dare to sign engineering contracts with the groups, but only asked the workers to write guarantees, which hindered the smooth progress of the work.

Fifth, rationally solve the problem of labor rate and rewards, and care about the workers' lives in order to consolidate the workers' production enthusiasm. In some units that implement piece-rate wages, the original quota was very low, 550 ordinary bricks per worker, and the salary was 18,000 yuan. In addition to the basic salary, the average bricklayer can receive a bonus of 20% to 40% per day. Since the implementation of the new bricklaying method, a worker can earn 53,000 yuan by laying 1,600 bricks per day. In this way, the bonus exceeds twice the basic salary. This not only does not conform to the principle of considering both public and private interests, but also affects the production enthusiasm of other industrial workers. In contrast, in some units that implement time-based wages, workers' work efficiency has more than doubled, creating a large amount of wealth for the country, but the workers' wages remain the same, which does not conform to the principle of "more work, more pay," which has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among group members, and even some workers have withdrawn from the group, hindering the promotion of this advanced experience. Therefore, it is necessary to rationally solve the problem of quotas and rewards in order to consolidate and improve workers' production enthusiasm.

Sixth, in key promotion, the selection of group members and the selection of construction sites are also very important. When selecting group members, attention must be paid to their political quality and technical level; and construction sites with more brick work should be selected for experiments in order to fully demonstrate the superiority of the "Su Changyou Bricklaying Method." This time, some units did not pay enough attention when selecting group members, and they were not well educated. Some group members could not withstand the ridicule and suffering of the outside world, and dropped out of the scene halfway and changed shifts. Some units selected construction sites that had no brick work after three days, and there was no way to continue the experiment. Although the problems were not very serious, they all more or less hindered the progress of the pilot work. This should be paid attention to.

    北京建筑业推广“苏长有砌砖法”的经验
    中华全国总工会建筑工会工作委员会
    北京市建筑业推行“苏长有砌砖法”以后，合理地解决了劳动组织问题，实行了科学的分工负责制度，大大提高了工作效率。过去一个大工（技术工人）一天能砌四百块到七百块砖，现在一个大工一个小工（辅助技术工人工作的非技术工人）能砌一千八百块到二千八百块砖。如果以一个小工顶一个大工计算，相当原来效率的百分之二百。如果以两个小工顶一个大工计算，则相当原来效率的百分之二百八十；而且保证了工程质量。
        在推翻封建把头制度的基础
    上推广“苏长有砌砖法”
    今年九月北京市建筑业开始推行“苏长有砌砖法”时，新建工程任务很大，技术工人缺乏，劳动力的组织和使用不够合理。而且，大部分建筑公司封建把头制度没有彻底废除，全市正在发动群众进行大规模的反把头斗争；少数已经基本上废除了封建把头制度的公司，因为行政干部和工会干部工作不够深入，工人有行帮保守思想，因此，新的生产制度还没有完全确立，群众性的生产竞赛还没有全面展开。根据这个情况，建筑工会工作委员会决定首先在已经基本上废除了封建把头制度的中共中央直属机关修建办事处、中国建筑企业公司、人民大学施工所三个单位的八个工地，推行“苏长有砌砖法”，给进行了反把头斗争以后的生产工作开辟道路。为了这，中共中央直属机关修建办事处、中国建筑企业公司、人民大学施工所曾经约请参加国庆节观礼的东北区劳动模范代表苏长有亲自到新市区、玉泉山、文化宫等地，先后作了五次报告，举行了三次指导演习，得到了广大工人群众的拥护、工程技术人员的称赞和领导干部的支持。但也有少数技术人员和部分工人表示怀疑。他们认为：“关里墙窄，造型复杂，这方法恐怕用不上。”也有些人说：“好是好，就是不顺手。”少数保守思想较大的老技术工人甚至轻蔑地说：“他总共有多大年纪，有多少经验，这法儿谁不会！”针对这些思想情况，中共中央直属机关修建办事处、中国建筑企业公司、人民大学施工所都召开了党、行政、工会、青年团的会议，研究了推广的办法，成立了专门推广“苏长有砌砖法”的组织机构。在工人群众自觉自愿的基础上，领导方面采取了号召、报名、审查、批准的方法，组织了第一批苏长有式的砌砖小组；并对组员进行了深入的思想教育，规定了学会、熟练、创造纪录的工作步骤。有的单位并且在实验前夕，详细介绍了工程构造和做法，使每个工人明确地知道了自己的任务和职责，心里有了数。第一天试验的结果是：中共中央直属机关修建办事处一个大工、一个小工砌了一千五百块；中国建筑企业公司二个大工、二个小工砌了五千一百二十块；人民大学施工所一个大工、二个小工砌了二千七百块。他们不仅保证了质量标准，而且在数量上超过原来工作效率的一倍半左右。这么一来，工人生产情绪非常高涨。当晚领导方面就开会检讨工作中的优点和缺点，并计划、布置和改进明天的工作。以后，这种会议便形成了制度。各小组都订立了小组爱国公约，有的小组还订立了师徒合同，在生产上呈现了一种新气象。过去那种讽刺积极干活的工人的话再听不到了。现在听到的是：“为什么不把我们组织起来，难道我们干活不积极吗？”成功的事实打破了一些技术人员原来认为“这个办法只适用于关外，不适用于关内；只适用于造型简单的工程，不适用于造型复杂的工程”等等不正确的看法，使大家对开展这个运动有了足够的信心。那些有技术保守思想，对这方法不大服气的老师傅，也逐渐地学习试用这个方法了。在这些工地里，现在采用这种新的砌砖法的已经有六十一个小组。
    这些小组推行“苏长有砌砖法”的结果，证明了
    “苏长有砌砖法”的优越性。
        推行“苏长有砌砖法”的成果
    首先，在劳动组织上实行了科学分工、各负专责的制度。过去，一个班的工人分到三四个地方做工，都是上班临时派活，零散个体做工；今天砌这里，明天砌那里。工人心里没有数，听组长吩咐，盲目做工。生产没有定额，做多少算多少，也没有对工程负责的观念。有的大工和小工互相等待，有些工种比赛磨洋工。技术工人操作非技术劳动（非技术劳动要占用一个技术工人三分之二的劳动时间），浪费了人力和时间。在固定了工作地点和工作任务以后，工人心里有了数，大家都能自觉地工作。师徒之间互相帮助，工种之间互相推动。技术工人不作非技术劳动，每个人都在重复着单纯的工作，减少了非生产时间，而且容易提高熟练程度。因此，原计划用一百七十个大工、在两个月完工，还怕完不成任务的工程，现在同一时间内，只要四十个大工就可以保证完成任务。据初步统计，七十五万块砖的工程可以节省工资一千八百七十五万元。过去需用一千七百三十五个小工、七百八十一个大工的工程，现在用四百五十六个小工、一百五十二个大工就可以完成，而且保证了工程质量。
    其次，使用材料节省了。过去有的灰槽子从楼上踢下来没人过问，灰沙浪费很大；有的挑砖不挑半截砖，有的挑来了也不用，砖的损耗率有的高达百分之五到百分之十五；现在按照公约，作到了“不掉灰、不剩碎砖、地下干净，保证不浪费一铲灰、一块砖”。据初步调查，有的十万块砖的工程，即可省灰一担，砖的损耗率降低到百分之一至百分之五。
    第三，改善了师徒关系。过去没有固定的师徒关系，大家都不负责。徒弟全靠自己摸索，“前二年上不了墙”，要出师是“三年零一季”。现在编组后，就把徒弟分配给师傅带领；不仅消除了旧的封建关系，而且使徒弟随时可向师傅学习，互相帮助，互相保证。他们把瓦工手艺分成一百样，师傅保证十天教会徒弟三样手艺，爱护徒弟；徒弟则保证学会、记住，工作积极，尊敬师傅。正如一个学徒工说的：“过去两个月也学不会一样活，现在这样，半年多就可以拿铲做活了。”这样，也就改善了师徒关系，密切了工人和技术人员之间的团结。
    第四，工会工作找到了面向生产的门径。过去工会工作抓不住中心，常常乱忙一顿。小组会议不经常开，内容也很单调，工人对开会兴趣不高；有些行政干部感到工会可有可无，工人反映“工会没起作用”。现在是按生产小组建立工会小组，工会面向生产，建立了工会工作制度，充实了工会小组生活内容（如检讨当天工作，讨论怎样完成明天工作任务，检查师徒合同、安全问题的执行情况，修订爱国公约等等）。工人有事就来找工会解决，行政干部有事就和工会商讨办理。
    做好准备工作是顺利推广 “苏长有砌砖法”的关键
    北京市建筑业推广“苏长有砌砖法”已取得了初步经验。
    第一，废除把头制度、提高工人群众的觉悟是胜利推行“苏长有工作法”的基本条件。把头制度存在，工人处在被压迫的地位，便无从发扬劳动积极性和创造性。这是推行任何革新的工作方法所必须先解决的问题。北京这次推行“苏长有砌砖法”成功，就是由于选择废除了把头制度的工地作为试点；在推行过程中，更进一步改变了旧有劳动组织，彻底铲除了把头制度的基础。
    第二，推行“苏长有砌砖法”，必须结合着爱国主义的教育，进行充分的思想动员、酝酿，使它变成群众自己的要求，使群众树立克服困难取得胜利的充分信心和决心。这次推广实验的事实告诉我们：凡是动员得好、酝酿成熟的小组，他们的生产情绪就始终饱满，不怕外界的讽刺、打击和客观条件的困难，而创造了新纪录。但有些行政干部只强调学习这种工作方法，而忽视了对工人进行劳动教育和政治教育，急于求成，结果组成的小组的质量、效率都不够高，有的甚至集体磨洋工。
    第三，领导干部重视，亲自动手，并吸收技术人员参加。因为推行“苏长有砌砖法”是建筑业劳动组织上的改革，在工作的过程中必然会遇到困难和问题；尤其是在行帮保守思想比较严重的建筑工人中，更会产生各种各样的思想顾虑和抵抗。这次推行中，有些单位的领导干部，开始时重视不足，结果走了弯路，甚至失败。有的单位的领导干部在开始时重视，而后来普遍推广时放松了领导，成绩也就不好。因此，必须有党、行政、工会、青年团各方面领导干部的积极支持，并亲自动手，吸收技术人员参加，及时地解决在技术上发生的一些新的问题，才能够顺利地推行。
    第四，做好各方面的准备工作，使各个工种都能有机地配合起来。这是“苏长有砌砖法”顺利推广的关键。有的单位行政干部计划不够，没有很好地配合，因而瓦工工作效率提高之后，原料供应不上；架子工翻不上去，有些瓦工自己搭架子，结果摔伤了；有的找不到技术员，用扁担代替尺子量窗口，结果砌成后返了工；更有的行政干部，没有充分地准备计划，不敢给小组订工程合同，只叫工人写保证书，结果妨碍了工作的顺利进展。
    第五，合理地解决工率和奖励问题，关心工人生活，才能巩固工人的生产情绪。有些实行计件工资制的单位，原来定额很低，每工砌普通砖五百五十块，工资一万八千元。一般瓦工除得基本工资外，每天可分红利百分之二十到百分之四十。自实行新的砌砖法以来，一个工人以每天砌一千六百块砖计算，可得五万三千元。这样，分红就超过了基本工资的二倍。这不仅不合乎公私兼顾的原则，而且影响了其他产业工人的生产情绪。和这相反，有的实行计时工资制的单位，工人工作效率提高了一倍多，为国家创造了大批财富，但工人的工资依然照旧，不合乎“多劳多得”的原则，因而引起组员的普遍不满，甚至有的工人退出了小组，妨碍了这一先进经验的推广。因此，必须合理地解决定额和奖励问题，才能巩固和提高工人的生产情绪。
    第六，在重点推广时，小组成员的选择和工地的选择，也是非常重要的。选择小组成员时，必须注意他们的政治质量、技术程度；并且要选择砖活比较多的工地实验，才能充分表现出“苏长有砌砖法”的优越性。这次有的单位，选择小组成员时，没有很好注意，而且对他们教育不够，一些组员经不起外界的讽刺和困难的折磨，而中途退场换班。有的单位选择的工地干了三天就没有砖活了，没法继续试验。虽然问题不很严重，但也都或多或少地妨碍了试点工作的进行。这是应该加以注意的。
