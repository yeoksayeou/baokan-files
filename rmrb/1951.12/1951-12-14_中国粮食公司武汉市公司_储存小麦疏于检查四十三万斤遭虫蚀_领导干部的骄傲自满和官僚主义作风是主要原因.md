    Stored Wheat Neglected Due to Lack of Inspection, 430,000 Jin Damaged by Insects
    Arrogance, Complacency, and Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres are the Main Reasons
    The arrogance, complacency, and bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Company of the China National Grain Corporation have resulted in a serious loss of 430,000 jin of wheat damaged by insects. The amount of loss is equivalent to the output of 2,171 mu of good land, the harvest of 181 farmers for a whole year, and enough for 8,686 people to eat for a month.

    According to inspection, in the wheat storage warehouses of Fuxin and Wufeng Flour Mills under the Wuhan Municipal Grain Corporation, stacks were as high as fifteen sacks, and as wide as eight to ten sacks. Insect webs were dense between the stacks, and handfuls of scattered grain and dead and live insects could be grabbed from the ground. In the most severely infested areas, there were more than 2,500 insects per kilogram of grain. Wheat grains that were completely empty, half-empty, and partially eaten by insects accounted for 40 percent of the total stored wheat.

    After discovering this phenomenon, the Grain Corporation not only did not take effective measures to deal with it, but also processed a large amount of insect-infested wheat without determining the gross wheat flour extraction rate, in an attempt to prevent people from checking the exact amount.

    The main reason for the loss due to insect infestation is the blind arrogance and complacency of the leading cadres of this company. They had achieved some success in previous grain protection work. Once the plum rain season was over, they believed that the task of "not spoiling a single grain" had been completed. In fact, as early as May of this year, the Central South Region Grain Corporation had raised the issue of insect infestation in stored grain to them; specific instructions were also given at the Second Storage and Transportation Conference held in August. However, these did not attract the attention of the leading cadres of this company. The manager, section chiefs, department heads, warehouse directors, and resident inspectors rarely went to the warehouse for inspection. On October 8th, Wufeng Mill requested the Municipal Company to handle the insect infestation, but the leading cadres only "approved" it on the official documents, without sending anyone to investigate or take any measures. The Regional Company sent people to inspect for seven or eight days, but the Municipal Company was unaware of it, and the manager, Niu Yutian, did not even take a look. The Municipal Company had overlapping organizations and unclear division of labor, resulting in mutual buck-passing when problems arose. For example, Fuxin Mill was originally under the management of the First Warehouse, but after the organizational adjustment in August, it was decided to transfer it to the First Branch Company; however, the handover procedures were delayed until October. Therefore, for a period of time, neither party was responsible for the warehouse operations. The warehouses of the two mills were managed by the Municipal Company and the First Warehouse, but the allocation of stored grain and accounting were controlled by the Storage and Transportation Section. When problems arose, they passed the buck to each other, creating a "three-no-one-cares" situation. In addition, unclear work assignments from the leadership were also one of the reasons for the loss.

    储存小麦疏于检查四十三万斤遭虫蚀
    领导干部的骄傲自满和官僚主义作风是主要原因
    中国粮食公司武汉市公司领导干部的骄傲自满、官僚主义作风，造成了虫蚀四十三万斤小麦的严重损失。损失量等于好地二千一百七十一亩的产量，等于一百八十一个农民全年劳动的收获，足够八千六百八十六人吃一个月。
    据检查，武汉市粮食公司在福新、五丰面粉厂的存麦仓库，堆垛高达十五个麻袋，宽八个至十个麻袋，垛间虫网密布，地下的散粮和死虫活虫，伸手就可以抓一大把。虫害最严重的，每公斤粮食中有二千五百多只虫。被虫吃得全空、半空及吃去一部的麦粒，要占总存量的百分之四十。
    粮食公司发现这个现象以后，不但没有作有效的处理，反而在未定毛麦粉率的情况下就大量把虫麦加工，企图使人检查不出确切的数目。
    虫蛀损失的主要原因是这个公司的领导干部有盲目的骄傲自满情绪。他们在过去的护粮工作中，曾有过一些成绩。黄梅季节一过，他们就认为“不坏一粒粮”的任务已经完成。其实，早在今年五月，中南区粮食公司就向他们提出存粮生虫问题；在八月间举行的第二届储运会议上又作了专门指示。但是，这些都没有引起这个公司的领导干部的注意。经理、科长、股长、仓库主任、驻厂检查员都很少去仓库检查。十月八日，五丰厂请求市公司处理虫害事件，领导干部只是在公文上“批办”了，但并没派人去了解，也没采取任何措施。区公司派人去检查了七、八天，市公司还不知道，经理牛玉田也没去看一看。市公司机构重叠，分工不明，有了问题彼此推诿。像福新厂，原属第一仓库管理，八月调整机构，决定划归第一分公司；但一直拖到十月还没办交代手续。所以有一个时期，仓库业务双方都不管。两厂仓库是由市公司及第一仓库管理，但存粮调拨及账目却又由储运科掌握。有了问题，互相推诿，形成三不管的局面。另外，领导上对工作布置不明确，也是造成损失的原因之一。
