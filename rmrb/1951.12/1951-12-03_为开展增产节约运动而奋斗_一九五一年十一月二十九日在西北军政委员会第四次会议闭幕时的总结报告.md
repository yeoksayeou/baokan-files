Comrades and Members:

The Fourth Meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee is about to close. Our meeting has been very successful. Based on the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we summarized our work over the past eight months and discussed in detail the issues of launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement and strengthening the work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. The reason our meeting was successful is that everyone considered issues and offered opinions with a responsible attitude towards the people's cause, which ensured our unity and consistency in our work. This shows that we are cooperating even better. Our better cooperation is a guarantee for continuing to do a good job in the future.

Since the Third Meeting, during these eight months, we have carried out work in various aspects and achieved great results. The Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Patriotic Movement has been popularized in areas with 80% of the population, and it has also been carried out in various ethnic minority areas. This is the largest and most profound education for the masses. In areas where this movement has been deeply carried out, the political consciousness of the people has generally improved. The movement to donate weapons has been launched and closely combined with increasing production, paying grain, paying taxes, and preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, becoming the driving force for promoting all work. In the future, it is still necessary to continue to deepen this movement in all areas and pay attention to promoting it in some areas where it has not yet been popularized. After completing land reform in the Guanzhong, Longdong, and other areas with a population of 8 million this spring, we actively prepared and have started land reform in areas with a population of 15 million in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. In Xinjiang, rent reduction is being carried out in areas with a population of 4 million. This meeting approved the plans of the provinces. This is the most arduous and intense task at present, and we must learn from last year's experience, boldly mobilize the peasant masses, unite all peasants, expand the anti-feudal united front, and strive to do this work well. A small number of ethnic minority areas that have not undergone land reform will be completed later. Areas where land reform has already been carried out are concentrating their efforts on further organizing and educating peasants and developing agricultural production. In June and July, we began to carry out the Democratic Reform Movement in some factories, mines, and enterprises. Through mobilizing and relying on the worker masses, we eliminated counter-revolutionaries, overthrew the remaining feudal forces, and improved administrative management and trade union work. Employees are more united, and production has generally increased. This movement is now being continued to be promoted to public and private factories, mines, and transportation departments and other enterprises and certain industries. This work should be done well throughout the region next year. Our cultural and educational undertakings have generally recovered and developed. The broad masses of intellectuals have generally made progress, but they are still far from the standards required by our national construction. We must strengthen our leadership over cultural and educational undertakings and continue to carry out a large-scale ideological remolding movement. The basic method is to organize and guide various intellectuals to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and, on a completely voluntary basis, carry out criticism and self-criticism in light of the various incorrect thoughts and viewpoints that actually exist, in order to achieve the goal of self-education and remolding. In the future, over a long period of time, it will be necessary to use great efforts to guide this movement. In addition, we have made achievements and progress in promoting the system of people's representative conferences at all ethnic groups and all circles, in organizing and educating workers, peasants, women, youth, and other mass work, in training ethnic minority cadres, and in various financial and economic work. This year's grain and cotton production has exceeded the pre-liberation level. Industrial production has also generally exceeded the pre-liberation level. Animal husbandry has also largely approached recovery. In terms of railway transportation, the Northwest Railway Trunk Line project has begun to overcome bureaucratic work styles and waste phenomena, greatly saving state resources and shortening the project time limit. With the active efforts of all employees, the task of striving to open the Lanzhou line to traffic next year has been determined. In short, the work of these eight months has been arduous and intense. Next year's work will inevitably be even more arduous and intense. But our hard work will surely be exchanged for a bright future. It is now clear that, after about one year of work next year, we may be able to enter large-scale planned economic construction in the year after next.

Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country to launch a movement to increase production and practice economy. We warmly respond to this call, which is the biggest political task before us. The launch of this movement will surely accumulate a large amount of wealth for the country, increase national defense strength, support the Chinese People's Volunteers in winning the victory in the struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and will surely greatly promote our work in all aspects, especially economic construction work. Both increasing production and practicing economy are positive. Increasing production must practice economy, and practicing economy is for the sake of increasing production. If we want to build industry, we must constantly accumulate a large amount of funds. The source of these funds mainly relies on all of our people to solve through the method of increasing production and practicing economy. It is impossible and should not rely on other methods. In this sense, increasing production and practicing economy is not a temporary means to solve some kind of difficulty, but a fundamental method for building our country, and a policy with constant importance in our national construction. Some people say: "The Northwest economy is backward, and the possibility of increasing production is not great." "The Northwest is poor, and not much can be saved." "Waste in the Northwest is not serious, corruption is less, and there is no way to oppose it." These statements are incorrect and do not conform to the facts. This is a conservative view with a complacent mood. The equipment utilization rate of the Northwest mechanical industry system is only 29.3%. Doesn't this show that there is a great possibility of increasing equipment utilization rate? During the four months from July to October, the units under the Northwest Petroleum Administration have increased production and saved 30.16 billion yuan for the country; the Northwest Electric Power Administration and its directly affiliated units in Xi'an have proposed a plan to guarantee an increase in production and savings of 700 tons of grain before the end of the year. Aren't these great achievements? After repeated inspections, the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau found that the average surplus of various project budgets was more than 10%, and some key projects even had a surplus of 50%, and it has already saved the country several hundred billion yuan from revising plans and budgets. Isn't this a fact? The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has involved more than a thousand Communist Party members in the inspection and handling of corruption and degeneration cases in the past year and a half; and in state organs, there are some personnel who have transferred from the old military and political organs with a strong Kuomintang style and have not yet been seriously reformed. The phenomenon of corruption and dereliction of duty among them is more than that found among Communist Party members. Are there not more reasons to estimate it? Although we launched a rectification movement against extravagance and waste and against bureaucracy last year, and it also achieved great results, the house must be cleaned frequently, and the face must be washed every day. Today, we propose: Continue to oppose bureaucracy, oppose corruption, and oppose waste, in order to clear the obstacles to carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement. Isn't it equally timely? Starting from the relatively backward economic development situation in the Northwest region, it should be concluded that: precisely because we are backward, we must work harder to increase production and practice economy, develop our economy as soon as possible, improve the people's lives, and catch up with other advanced regions in the country. Starting from the fact that economic work in the Northwest region is still relatively backward, it should be concluded that: precisely because we have less experience in doing economic work, we don't manage industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry much, and there are many loopholes in our work, the possibility of increasing production and practicing economy is still very, very large, and we must actively carry out the increase production and practice economy movement. Isn't this estimate and conclusion more correct? Isn't it more in line with reality and the interests of the people?

Regarding the direction and methods of launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in the Northwest region, Deputy Director Jia Tuofu has already given a detailed report, and after discussions in the general meeting and group discussions, everyone has put forward many good opinions. The most important thing is to implement the following six points:

1. The people's governments of the provinces should shift their attention to leading industrial production and economic undertakings, manage existing enterprises well, and strive to learn. All state-owned factories, mines, and local enterprises must, on the basis of existing equipment and original production plans, start from improving equipment utilization rates, promoting advanced experience, improving operating methods, clearing assets, saving funds and raw materials, reducing management costs, and fully exploiting all potential forces, increasing production quantity and quality, and reducing defective products and losses, etc., to study and formulate an increase production and practice economy plan for the entire year of next year, report to the Northwest Military and Political Committee for approval by mid-December at the latest, and mobilize and rely on all employees to strive to complete the plan. The construction of new mines and the addition of equipment to existing mines must ensure that construction starts on schedule, and the increase production and practice economy movement must be promoted in the same way. The increase production and practice economy movement should also be launched in private enterprises. Encourage private investment in industry and mining and provide guidance. A positive development policy should be adopted for local enterprises, but blindness must be prevented, a plan must be formulated, and then it should be done. The period of planned economic construction in our country is coming soon. The Northwest will be one of the important bases for national economic construction. We must more actively strengthen resource exploration, investigation and statistics in the Northwest region, and earnestly do a good job in planning, so as to be fully prepared and accurately plan to start the economic construction work of the Great Northwest.

2. Developing agriculture to increase grain production and developing animal husbandry and forestry production are still important aspects of our long-term efforts. In agriculture, we will generally no longer increase wasteland reclamation. We will strive to increase grain production by 1 billion jin and cotton by 600,000 dan by increasing the yield per unit area next year. The competent departments at all levels should immediately make specific plans and do more work in guiding the masses' mutual aid in labor exchange, accumulating and applying fertilizer, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and improving and developing water conservancy, to ensure the completion of this task. In terms of animal husbandry, we will strive to increase the number of draught animals by 350,000 head and sheep by 2.5 million next year; in terms of forestry, we plan to afforest 210,000 mu and close mountains for afforestation by 2 million mu next year. The competent departments of the Northwest Military and Political Committee should make specific plans to guide and assist various places in implementation. And attention should be paid to promoting farmers to raise sheep and pigs for fertilizer accumulation, and planting field protection forests in agricultural areas, so that agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production can be combined with each other.

3. Financial and trade work must be closely integrated with production and serve production. In particular, the state-owned trade system, in order to meet the needs of the development of public and private economies, must ensure that the total value of purchases next year increases by 50% compared with this year's completion, and the total value of sales increases by 100%. It should be combined with the business operations of supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, and vigorously support their development, so that the cooperatives can achieve a doubling of membership and a doubling of share capital next year. The targets of purchase and promotion are mainly the main and sideline products and daily necessities and means of production of the broad rural and pastoral areas. The experience of this year's exchange of local products should be summed up, and the new situation should be taken into account, and correct guidance should be given to the sideline production of the masses in various places, so that it can be combined with market needs and overcome blindness. Strengthen guidance to private commerce and strengthen market management to stabilize prices more effectively.

4. Strengthen financial work. Ensure the completion of the tasks of public grain and taxation. Strictly manage various warehouses and strive to reduce or even eliminate losses. Conscientiously implement the budget and final accounts and various financial systems. Ensure the necessary expenses for national defense construction, market stability, and economic construction, and other undertakings should be carried out according to their capabilities, and affairs that can be postponed or not done should be postponed or not done. Resolutely overcome the egalitarianism that does not distinguish between priorities and secondary, and starts everything at the same time.

5. Adjust institutions and improve work efficiency. According to our specific situation here, we must implement the principle of reasonable adjustment, streamlining the upper levels, and strengthening the lower levels. After appropriate adjustment and streamlining, the greater area can reduce one-fifth of the personnel, the provinces and cities can reduce one-tenth of the personnel, and the special area level should also be reduced in accordance with the national staffing regulations, but the levels below the county should generally not be reduced, but should be reasonably adjusted and strengthened. The number of levels should be reduced, the procedures for handling affairs should be simplified, and the enthusiasm and creativity of staff should be brought into play to improve work efficiency. In this way, not only will the waste of manpower and financial resources caused by overlapping and bloated institutions be greatly reduced, but also the existing bureaucratic work style will be organizationally resisted. It must be ensured that the personnel reduced are filled into grassroots organizations as much as possible, and that enough cadres are successively transferred to effectively strengthen economic construction work.

6. Practice strict economy and launch a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The first is to manage capital construction well. Learn from the experience of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, send cadres deep into the lower levels, go to the construction site in person, mobilize and rely on the worker masses, unite technical engineering personnel, repeatedly inspect, promote democracy, reward creativity, break down conservative views, expose and overcome corruption and waste phenomena, and fight for improving work efficiency and saving national resources. The second is to strengthen the financial management of various business institutions. On the one hand, it is to use money rationally and ensure that the existing money is used for the most necessary undertakings; on the other hand, it is to save expenses and advocate using the minimum amount of money to do the maximum amount of things. Criticism must be launched and corrected against the irresponsible bureaucratic work style of wasting money and not doing a good job. The third is that, in addition to giving necessary attention to the lives of those on the supply system and salary system to prevent them from declining, the living and office expenses of the institutions should be saved as much as possible, and our fine tradition of hard work and plain living should be promoted. Stop building and buying houses, streamline meetings, abolish unnecessary banquets, gift-giving, and other complicated rituals, strictly implement various systems, and greatly promote the cherishing of public property. The corruption cases discovered in various aspects must be thoroughly investigated, seriously handled, and necessary struggles must be carried out to educate cadres. Severe punishment must be given to elements who seriously damage state property.

After this meeting, all localities should conduct a rectification and study movement with the main content of continuing to oppose bureaucracy, oppose corruption, and oppose waste, combined with inspection work, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, promote advantages, correct shortcomings, and solve outstanding problems, in order to improve the ideology of cadres, enforce state laws and regulations, improve work styles, and promote work. This rectification should be carried out in a concentrated manner in a short period of time in all localities, with a maximum of no more than one month. The time can generally be chosen from December this year to January next year, and cannot be delayed any longer.

In the midst of this rectification movement, and on the ideological basis of this rectification movement, actively and comprehensively launch the increase production and practice economy movement. In launching the increase production and practice economy movement, the leading organs must grasp several key aspects, deeply mobilize the masses, and frequently inspect and guide, make significant achievements, and gain experience. But it must gradually promote this movement to the broadest masses of the people, guide mass organizations such as trade unions, peasant associations, women, and youth to work together to develop the increase production and practice economy movement, so that this movement becomes the content of life for the broad masses and a new social atmosphere, so that this movement can develop enthusiastically, intensely, and persistently. We believe that when this movement is launched, we will surely achieve great results, and we will surely learn many things, and we will achieve new and greater victories.

    为开展增产节约运动而奋斗
    ——一九五一年十一月二十九日在西北军政委员会第四次会议闭幕时的总结报告
    习仲勋各位委员、各位同志：
    西北军政委员会第四次会议就要闭幕了。我们的会议开得很好，依据中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的决议，总结了我们八个月的工作，详细讨论了开展增产节约运动，加强抗美援朝工作的问题。我们会议所以开得好的原因，是大家都以对人民事业负责的态度，考虑问题，提出意见，这就保证了我们在工作上团结一致。这表明我们是合作得更好了。我们更好地合作，又是继续做好今后工作的保证。
    自第三次会议以来，这八个月期间，我们开展了各方面的工作，有很大成绩。抗美援朝爱国主义运动在百分之八十人口的地区普及了，在各少数民族地区也开展了。这是对群众一次规模最大的深刻的教育。凡是这个运动深入进行了的地区，人民群众的政治觉悟普遍提高，开展了捐献武器运动，并与增加生产、缴粮、纳税、优抚烈军属各项工作密切结合，成为推动一切工作的动力。今后仍须在一切地区继续深入这个运动，并注意向一部分尚未普及的地区去推行这个运动。经过大张旗鼓地镇压反革命，群众发动起来，严重打击了土匪、恶霸、特务、反动党团和反动会道门五类反革命分子，地方治安业已巩固；但是这个斗争仍然存在不彻底的地区和不彻底的方面，必须坚决执行第四次全国公安会议的决定，继续深入这个斗争。在今年春季完成了关中、陇东等处八百万人口地区的土地改革之后，我们就积极准备并已在陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省一千五百万人口的地区着手进行土地改革。在新疆四百万人口的地区进行减租。这次会议批准了各省的计划。这是当前最繁重最紧张的一项工作，必须好好地吸收去年的经验，放手发动农民群众，团结全体农民，扩大反封建统一战线，努力做好此项工作。尚有一小部分少数民族地区未经土地改革，则留待以后完成之。已经土地改革的地区，正集中力量进一步组织和教育农民，发展农业生产。六、七月间，我们开始在一些工厂、矿山及企业内进行民主改革运动，经过发动和依靠工人群众，清除了反革命分子，打倒了残余的封建势力，行政管理工作和工会工作都有改进，职工更加团结，生产普遍提高。现在正向公、私工厂、矿山和交通部门等企业及某些行业继续推行这个运动，要在明年内在全区普遍做好此项工作。我们的文化教育事业已普遍恢复并且有了发展。广大的知识分子一般地都有进步，但距离我们国家建设所需要的标准还很远。我们对文化教育事业的领导必须加强，必须继续开展一个大规模的思想改造运动，基本方法，就是组织和引导各种知识分子学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，在完全自觉的基础上，针对实际存在的各种不正确的思想、观点，开展批评与自我批评，以达到自我教育改造之目的。今后在一个长时期内，须要用很大力量去指导这个运动。此外，我们在推行各族各界人民代表会议制度方面，在组织和教育工人、农民、妇女、青年等群众工作方面，在培养民族干部方面，在各项财政经济工作方面，均有成绩，也都有进步。今年的粮食、棉花产量已超过了解放前的水平。工业生产也一般地超过解放前水平。畜牧业也大体接近恢复。在铁路交通方面，西北铁路干线工程，开始克服了官僚主义作风和浪费现象，大大节约了国家资财，缩短了工程时限，在全体员工积极努力之下确定了争取明年通车兰州的任务。总之，这八个月的工作，是繁重的、紧张的。明年的工作也必然是更加繁重的、紧张的。但是我们的辛苦，必将换来光明的前程，现在已经可以看明白，大体上再经过明年一年的工作，到后年我们就有可能进入大规模的有计划的经济建设了。
    毛主席号召全国人民开展增加生产、厉行节约的运动，我们热烈响应这个号召，这是我们面前最大的政治任务。这个运动开展了，必将给国家积累大量财富，增加国防力量，支援中国人民志愿军获得抗美援朝斗争的胜利，也必然会大大推进我们各方面的工作，特别是经济建设工作。增产和节约都是积极的。增产必须节约，节约就是为了增产。我们要建设工业，就必须不断地积累大量的资金，这个资金的来源，主要的依靠我们全体人民用增产节约的办法来解决，不可能也不应该依靠别的办法解决。从这个意义上说，增产节约并不是解决某种困难的临时手段，而是建设我们国家的根本方法，是我们国家建设中一个有经常重要性的政策。有人说：“西北经济落后，增产可能性不大。”“西北地方穷，节约不出多少东西。”“西北浪费不严重，贪污少，没有反头。”这些说法，都是不正确的，也不合乎事实的。这是表现了一种带有自满情绪的保守观点。西北机械工业系统的设备利用率只达百分之二十九点三，这不是说明还有提高设备利用率的很大可能性吗？西北石油管理局所属单位从七月到十月的四个月期间，已经给国家增产节约了三百零一亿六千万元；西北电业管理总局及西安各直属单位，已经提出保证年底前增产节约粮食七百吨的计划。这些岂不都是很大的成绩吗？西北铁路干线工程局经过反复检查，发现各项工程预算平均剩余百分之十以上，有的重点工程竟达剩余百分之五十，并已从修改计划和预算中给国家节约几千亿元，这难道不是事实吗？中共中央西北局纪律检查委员会一年半来，在检查和处理贪污蜕化案件中，涉及到共产党员的数目即达千余人；而在国家机关中，有一部分从旧的军政机关转来的带有浓厚国民党作风又尚未认真改造的人员，在他们中间存在的贪污渎职现象，比共产党员中发现的还会更多些，更严重些，岂不是很有理由的估计吗？虽然去年我们曾开展了反对铺张浪费、反对官僚主义的整风运动，也有很大成效，但房子是要时常打扫的，脸是天天要洗的，今天提出：继续反对官僚主义、反对贪污、反对浪费，以清除开展增产节约运动的障碍，岂不是同样很切合时宜吗？从西北地区经济发展比较落后的情况出发，应当得出结论说：正因为我们落后，就更要努力增产节约，尽快发展我们的经济，改善人民的生活，向全国其他先进地区看齐。从西北地区经济工作也还比较落后的情况出发，应当得出结论说：正因为我们做经济工作经验还少，对工业、农业和畜牧业都还管得不多，我们工作中的漏洞还很多，增产节约的可能性就还很大很大，我们就更要积极地开展增产节约运动。这样的估计和结论，岂不是更正确些吗！岂不是更合乎实际，更合乎人民的利益吗！
    关于在西北地区开展增产节约运动的方向和办法，贾拓夫副主任已有详细的报告，又经过大会讨论和分组讨论，大家提出了很多很好的意见。最主要的就是实行以下六条：
    一、各省人民政府应当把自己的注意力转到领导工业生产及经济事业上，管好现有企业，努力学习。各国营工厂、矿山及地方企业，都要在现有设备及原生产计划的基础上，从提高设备利用率，推广先进经验，改进操作方法，清理资财，节约资金和原料，减少管理费用，充分发挥一切潜在力量，提高生产数量和质量，减少废品和损耗等等方面，加以研究，订出明年全年的增产节约计划，至迟于十二月中旬报告西北军政委员会批准，并发动和依靠全体职工为完成计划而奋斗。新建矿厂及原有矿厂的增加设备，须保证按期开工，并同样地推行增产节约运动。私营企业中也要开展增产节约运动。鼓励私人投资工、矿业，并给以指导。对地方企业应持积极发展的方针，但须防止盲目性，订出计划，然后去做。我们国家的有计划的经济建设时期很快就要到来了。西北将是国家经济建设重要基地之一，我们必须更加积极地加强西北区资源勘察、调查统计并切实做好计划工作，以便有充分准备和精确计划的开始大西北的经济建设工作。
    二、发展农业增产粮食，发展畜牧业、林业生产，仍然是我们长期努力的重要方面。在农业上，一般不再增开荒地。从提高单位面积产量，争取明年增产粮食十亿斤，棉花六十万担。各级主管部门，应即做出具体计划，并从指导群众的变工互助，积肥施肥，防治病虫害，改进和发展水利等几个方面，多做工作，保证这一任务的完成。畜牧业方面，明年争取增殖役畜三十五万头，羊子二百五十万只；林业方面，明年计划造林二十一万亩，封山育林二百万亩，均由西北军政委员会主管部门做出具体计划，指导并协助各地实行。并须注意在农业地区，提倡农户养羊养猪积肥，种植护田林，使农、牧、林业生产互相结合。
    三、金融贸易工作必须紧紧地与生产结合，为生产服务。特别是国营贸易系统，为适应公、私经济发展的需要，须保证明年收购总值较今年完成数增加百分之五十，销货总值增加一倍。应与各地供销合作社经营业务相结合，并大力扶助其发展，使明年合作社能达到发展社员两倍扩大股金一倍。收购和推销的对象，主要的是广大农村和游牧区人民的主、副产品及其生活必需品和生产资料。应当总结今年交流土产的经验，并照顾新的情况，给各地群众的副业生产以正确指导，使之与市场需要相结合，克服盲目性。加强对私营商业的指导，并加强对市场的管理，更有力地稳定物价。
    四、加强财政工作。保证公粮、税收任务完成。严格管理各种仓库，力求减少以至消灭损失。认真执行预决算和各项财务制度。保证国防建设，稳定市场和经济建设方面的必需费用，其他各项事业则量力举办，凡可不办或缓办的事务即应不办或缓办。坚决克服不分轻重缓急、百废俱兴的平均主义思想。
    五、调整机构，提高工作效能。依我们这里具体情况，必须实行合理调整，精简上层，加强下层的原则。经过适当地调整和精简，大区可以缩减五分之一的人员，各省、市可以缩减十分之一的人员，专区一级也应按照全国编制规定加以缩减，但县以下则一般不应减少，而应合理调整并加强之。应减少层次，简化办事规程，发挥工作人员的积极性、创造性，以提高工作效能。这样，不但将大大减少由于机构重叠、臃肿所形成的人力、财力的浪费，而且对于尚存在的官僚主义作风，也将从组织上给以抵制。必须做到将缩减下来的人员，尽量充实基层组织，并保证陆续抽调足够的干部，切实加强经济建设方面的工作。
    六、厉行节约，开展反对贪污浪费，反对官僚主义的斗争。首先是管好基本建设，学习西北铁路干线工程局的经验，分派干部深入下层，亲到工地，发动和依靠工人群众，团结技术工程人员，反复检查，发扬民主，奖励创造，打破保守观点，揭发并克服贪污、浪费现象，为提高工作效率和节约国家资财而斗争。其次，是加强各事业机关财务管理工作，一方面是合理用钱，保证将现有的钱，用到最必需的事业上去；另方面是节约开支，提倡以最小限度的钱，办最大限度的事。对于那种浪费金钱又办不好事业的不负责任的官僚主义作风，必须开展批评并加以纠正。再次，是除对供给制、薪金制人员的生活给予必要关注不使下降外，机关生活、办公费用，力求节约，发扬我们艰苦朴素的优良传统。停止修建和购买住房，精简会议，废除不必要的请客、送礼等繁礼俗仪，严格执行各项制度，并大大提倡爱护公物。对于各个方面发现的贪污案件，必须彻底查清严肃处理开展必要的斗争，用以教育干部。对于严重损害国家财产的分子，必须给以严厉惩处。
    我们这次会议后，各地都应进行一次以继续反对官僚主义、反对贪污、反对浪费为主要内容的整风学习运动，结合检查工作，发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，发扬优点，纠正缺点，解决突出的问题，以提高干部思想，严肃国家法纪，改进作风，推动工作。这次整风，各地都应在短时期内集中力量进行，最多不超过一月。时间大体都可选择在今年十二月到明年一月之内，不可再迟。
    在这个整风运动中间，并在这个整风运动的思想基础上，积极地、全面地开展增产节约运动。在开展增产节约运动中，领导机关必须抓住几个重点方面，深入发动群众，经常检查、指导，做出显著的成绩，取得经验。但又必须逐渐地将这个运动推广到最广泛的人民群众中去，指导工会、农会、妇女、青年等群众团体，共同为开展增产节约运动而努力，使这个运动成为广大群众自己的生活内容，成为新的社会风气，这样，这个运动才能够热烈地、紧张地、持久地发展下去。我们相信：这个运动开展起来，我们一定获得很大的成绩，我们也一定学会很多的东西，我们将得到新的更大的胜利。
