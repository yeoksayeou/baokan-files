The Broad Masses of Farmers Urgently Demand New-Style Farm Implements

In the past two years, the promotion of new-style farm implements has achieved preliminary results. According to available statistics, up to now, a total of 77,269 new-style farm implements have been promoted nationwide (according to incomplete statistics). Considering that farmers in various regions mostly borrow and use new-style farm implements together, it is estimated that at least 100,000 households are now using new-style farm implements. Among the various farm implements promoted, walking plows account for 68%, cultivating implements (shovel cultivators and weeding hoes) account for 17%, Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements account for 12%, and processing implements (rice threshers, straw cutters, corn shellers, etc.) account for 2%. In addition, there are a small number of other farm implements. The promotion area is relatively widespread in the Northeast, and in Guannei (areas south of the Shanhaiguan Pass) there are more than 480 counties. This year, the area has expanded by more than 170% compared to last year. In various promotion areas, new-style farm implements have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. For example, at the Henan Provincial People's Representative Conference this year, there were more than 80 proposals related to new-style farm implements, accounting for 25% of the total number of proposals related to agricultural production. Although more than 10,000 new-style farm implements have been lent out in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, it is still felt that the supply is insufficient. Farmers in Zhangye County, Gansu Province, who borrowed new-style farm implements, felt that "happiness has come to their door." When new-style farm implements were transported to the village, farmers beat gongs and drums to thank the People's Government. In one spring, Chahar Province lent out all the farm implements that were prepared for promotion throughout the year. In the third district of Wu'an County, Hebei Province, 1,000 walking plows were lent out. Many regions have been unable to meet the farmers' urgent demand for new-style farm implements.

Using New-Style Farm Implements is an Important Factor in Improving Productivity

The use of new-style farm implements can improve agricultural productivity, which has been proven by the personal experience of farmers in the past two years. Deep plowing can make full use of the fertile soil below the surface layer, which is an important condition for increasing agricultural production. New-style walking plows generally plow two or three inches deeper than old plows; that is to say, plowing with a new-style walking plow can make use of the fertility of two or three more inches of soil. New-style walking plows turn the soil completely, which can completely bury the topsoil below, which can not only cover weeds and rot the grass, but also completely turn underground insects and insect eggs to the ground, destroying them by exposure to the sun and freezing. New-style walking plows have a good soil crushing effect, which can make the soil contain an appropriate amount of moisture and make the soil easier to absorb moisture, playing a role in resisting drought and flood. According to the experience of many farmers and the comparison of old and new plows by the appraisal group of the Farm Implements Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government among 36 specially invited households, it has been proven that using a 7-inch walking plow can increase production by an average of 16.8%, with a higher increase of 45% and a minimum of more than 5%. The use of 7-inch walking plows can increase the production of various grain crops. According to statistics on the increase in production after the adoption of 7-inch walking plows in various regions: wheat in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, can increase production by 45.4%; Shen Yuqin, a labor model in Licheng County, Shanxi, harvested 3 more dou of wheat per mu, an increase of 31%; corn in Yan'an County, Shaanxi, increased production by 39.4%; sorghum in Fugou County, Henan, increased production by 15%; and millet in Puyang, Pingyuan, increased production by 37.6%. Regarding the increase in production of economic crops, according to statistics: after using 7-inch walking plows, cotton in Qiuxian County, Hebei, increased production by 20%; cotton in Anyi, Shanxi, increased production by 31.3%; and tobacco in Xuchang, Henan, increased production by 12.4%. At the same time, the 7-inch walking plow is light and labor-saving, and its efficiency is about one-third higher than that of the old plow, and it can plow two to three more mu of land per day; and semi-laborers and women can use it. Therefore, the 7-inch walking plow is the farm implement that farmers—especially farmers in the plains areas of Guannei—most urgently need.

After the successful trial production of the integrated shovel cultivator in the Northeast this year, it has been widely promoted in rural areas. The integrated shovel cultivator is not only a good cultivating implement, but also an excellent plowing implement, which can increase the yield per unit area like a plow. In the mutual aid groups that use the integrated shovel cultivator, the old plows are all idle. Some farmers said: "Don't think that it costs a lot to buy an integrated shovel cultivator, it saves labor and produces more grain, so using it for one year is equivalent to picking up one for nothing." In the Ruan Xueshun mutual aid group in Wenfu Village, Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, shoveling and cultivating 9 hectares of corn land with the integrated shovel cultivator saved 25 workdays; in the Sun Qingbai mutual aid group in Shengouzi Village, a suburb of Shenyang, one person and one horse shoveled and cultivated 1.8 hectares of land a day, saving 3 workdays per hectare compared to the old plow, and shoveling and cultivating 6 more mu of land per day than the old plow. Because of the use of integrated shovel cultivators, the lending households and mutual aid groups have increased the number of shoveling and cultivating times, and have more confidence in completing the bumper harvest plan. In addition, in the plains areas of the Northeast, due to the large plots of land and strong livestock power, the promotion of Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements has also achieved considerable results in the past year. One hundred and four mutual aid groups using Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements initially only used them to reclaim wasteland; after recognizing the benefits of horse-drawn farm implements in land reclamation, they have further used them to cultivate mature land. The Li Kun mutual aid group in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, in addition to using horse-drawn farm implements to reclaim more than 70 hectares of wasteland, also used them to cultivate 14 to 15 hectares of mature land. Ninety percent of the mature land in the He Fengshan mutual aid group in Yushu County, Jilin Province, is cultivated with Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements, achieving intensive cultivation and increasing production. After the Han En mutual aid group in Bao'an Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, cultivated with horse-drawn farm implements, the average yield per hectare increased by 480 jin of grain, and 10.75 workdays were saved, leaving surplus labor. During the busy farming season, some labor can also be drawn out to engage in sideline production, greatly increasing income.

In addition, among the new-style farm implements promoted this year, there are also some three-tooth light weeding hoes and processing implements. The efficiency of these new farm implements is higher than that of old farm implements, and this has been fully confirmed. The three-tooth light weeding hoe is small, light, and easy to operate, saving labor, and can be pulled by a donkey, and semi-laborers can also use it. Two people and one donkey can hoe 20 to 30 mu of land per day, which is 6 to 10 times more efficient than the old-style hoe. The width of the hoeing can also be adjusted (from 11 inches to 21 inches), and it is suitable for general crops. The small straw cutter cuts the grass neatly, the length can be adjusted, and it is light and labor-saving. It can cut about 1,500 jin of straw per day, which is about 3 times more efficient than the old-style straw knife. The rice thresher is durable, labor-saving, and threshes cleanly. One person can thresh about 3,000 jin per day, which is 6 times more efficient than the old-style threshing method. Corn shellers are divided into large and small types. The large ones can shell 1,500 jin to 2,000 jin of corn per day, and the small ones can also shell more than 500 jin. Farmers believe that these new-style farm implements can indeed reduce the fatigue they feel when using old farm implements.

Using New-Style Farm Implements, Developing and Improving Rural Cooperative and Mutual Aid Organizations, and Improving Cultivation Methods

Because new-style farm implements are precisely manufactured and of good quality, their prices are higher than those of old farm implements; under the current rural economic conditions, one farmer cannot purchase them alone, and they are mostly purchased and used jointly by several households. In this way, new-style farm implements have played a certain role in consolidating and developing rural cooperative and mutual aid organizations. After the Xie Youhe mutual aid group in Xingjia Village, Seventh District, Qixia County, Shandong Province, borrowed a new-style plow, five individual households requested to join their mutual aid group. Gao Village in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, originally did not have a mutual aid group. After the walking plow was promoted in the village, farmer Yang Mingzhang first raised shares to buy it jointly, promoting the entire village. In less than a month, 13 mutual aid groups were established in the village, and 13 walking plows were borrowed. Eighty percent of the walking plows in Chahar Province are lent to mutual aid groups, most of which are organized because of the joint use of plows. Some mutual aid groups have consolidated and improved because they used new-style plows and harvested more grain. For example, the Wang Yongzhen mutual aid group in Lusheng Village, Seventeenth District, Hailun County, Northeast, changed its organizational form this spring due to the use of new-style farm implements, from the "horseback land" group (this type of group is based on horses, stipulating how much land a horse takes care of as one share, and people and horses cannot exchange work) in the form of primary mutual aid, to a mutual aid group where both people and horses are scored and recorded workdays; the number of members also increased from six households to eleven households. The Han En mutual aid group in Jiaohe County has improved labor efficiency due to the use of Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements, making agricultural and sideline industries more complete in professional division of labor. In order to give full play to the efficiency of new-style farm implements, the cultivated land of seven households in this group broke the boundaries, so that the land of the mutual aid group can be used centrally, the labor force is more organized, and it is convenient to develop into a more advanced agricultural production cooperative.

The use of new farm implements can not only promote the development, consolidation, and improvement of rural labor mutual aid organizations, but also change backward cultivation methods. For example, after using new-style farm implements, the He Fengshan mutual aid group in Yushu County, Jilin Province, changed most of its cultivated land from ridge cultivation to flat cultivation. Last year, the average yield of soybeans per hectare was 4,200 jin, an increase of 23.5% compared to the past. After using new-style farm implements, farmers in Aksu District, Xinjiang Province, changed broadcasting to strip sowing, which not only saved a lot of seeds, but also made the emergence of crops neat; more importantly, it directly promoted a series of improvements in cultivation methods, making it easier to weed and harvest.

Absorb Farmers' Opinions, Improve Manufacturing Technology, and Promote the Work Smoothly

The main reason why new-style farm implements have been successfully promoted in the past two years is that, on the one hand, attention has been paid to absorbing farmers' opinions in the promotion work, so that the design work and manufacturing technology of new-style farm implements have been improved, and the quality and efficiency have gradually improved, meeting the needs of farmers; at the same time, factories manufacturing new-style farm implements and farm implement promotion stations have increased significantly, providing a considerable material basis for the promotion work. On the other hand, farmers have realized in the two years of trial use that the use of new-style farm implements can indeed save labor and produce more grain.

In terms of design and manufacturing, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, which produces the most new-style farm implements, has accepted farmers' opinions and improved the 7-inch walking plow with the largest promotion volume. The walking plow initially manufactured by this factory had high cost and poor quality. Farmers complained that it was expensive, bulky, and not durable, so difficulties occurred during promotion. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory aimed at these shortcomings and made improvements, changing the material of the plow beam from elm wood to dried oak wood (the quality of oak wood is better than that of elm wood, and it is not easy to deform after drying), shortening the length, changing the material of the plow column to Ma steel, and thinning and reducing the size of the plow adjustment mechanism, namely the depth adjustment plate and the left and right adjustment plates (the material is Ma steel). This reduced the cost by 40% and made it lighter and more durable. At the same time, the specifications of the parts were marked so that the parts of each plow could be interchanged; and a foxtail-style safety hook was added to the depth adjustment plate at the front of the plow beam. This reduced the difficulty of matching and replacing parts and extended the service life of the plow. The Northwest Farm Implement Research Institute simplified the structure of the 5-inch walking plow, reducing the cost to one-fourth of the original 5-inch walking plow, which is very suitable for the purchasing power of farmers in the Northwest. This year, the Northeast Region summarized the advantages and disadvantages of various styles of shovel cultivators, learned from each other's strengths and created an integrated shovel cultivator, which can be adopted by rural areas throughout the Northeast. These improvements in design and manufacturing work have made new-style farm implements more suitable for the needs of farmers and facilitated the development of promotion work.

Farm Implement Factories and Farm Implement Promotion Stations are the Foundation for Manufacturing and Promoting New-Style Farm Implements

This year, the number of new-style farm implement manufacturing factories has increased to more than 160 nationwide (some of which are private factories). In addition to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the Shenyang Farm Implement Factory in the Northeast, the Heilongjiang Farm Implement Factory, the Jiamusi Farm Implement Factory, and the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory, etc., which can already supply various new-style farm implements in large quantities, the Kaifeng Machinery Factory in Henan, and the three manufacturing factories in Datong, Xuanhua, and Zhangyuan in Chahar have all successfully copied the 7-inch walking plow. Currently, many regions are building farm implement factories. These farm implement factories have prepared a strong force for future manufacturing work.

Within this year, the number of farm implement promotion stations has increased to 88, doubling the number last year. There are 33 stations in North China, 23 stations in Northwest China, 13 stations in Shandong Province and Subei District in East China, 10 stations in Henan Province in Central South China, and 9 stations in Northeast China. In addition to setting up farm implement promotion stations, the Northeast has also specially selected some advanced agricultural production mutual aid groups, lent them new-style farm implements, and taught them how to use the technology, so that they can play a demonstrative role. There were 39 such mutual aid groups using new-style farm implements last year, and this year the number has increased to 104. The farm implement promotion stations and mutual aid groups using new-style farm implements in various regions have now become bridges for promoting new-style farm implements. According to available statistics, more than 45,000 new-style farm implements have been promoted this year through farm implement promotion stations and mutual aid groups.

Several Issues that Should be Paid Attention to in the Work of Manufacturing and Promoting New-Style Farm Implements

Because the efficiency of new-style farm implements has been proven, farmers' demand for new-style farm implements is becoming more and more urgent. Doing a good job in promoting new-style farm implements is an important issue in the current development of agricultural production. In order to complete this task well, attention must be paid to solving the following issues:

First, the manufacturing of new-style farm implements should be planned and expanded to solve the supply problem of new-style farm implements. Although many factories have manufactured many new-style farm implements in the past two years; however, because they have not been well organized, these factories have not been able to exert their potential production capacity; and some factories have suffered losses in production because they cannot master manufacturing technology. Therefore, to solve the supply problem of new-style farm implements next year, it is necessary to: (1) Organize the factories that already have manufacturing capabilities and divide the work and cooperate. Those who have the conditions to manufacture walking plows should concentrate their efforts on manufacturing walking plows; other factories can produce cultivating, processing, and other farm implements according to their specific conditions. This division of labor and manufacturing can make manufacturing technology more skilled, so as to increase production and improve quality. (2) Systematically promote the manufacturing experience of advanced factories, and introduce the experience of all production processes from drawing blueprints to making samples. Advanced factories should help factories with poorer conditions train technical personnel. At the same time, attention should also be paid to supplementing the necessary equipment for these factories with poorer conditions. (3) Each province should establish farm implement manufacturing factories according to needs and possible conditions, so as to obtain materials locally, manufacture locally, and promote locally, so as to meet the needs of farmers more quickly.

Second, establish an inspection system to strictly prevent shoddy manufacturing. Although the product quality of farm implement manufacturing factories in the Northeast, Northwest, and North China has gradually improved, most of them have not marked the specifications, and the quality is still not high. After the farm implements are lent out, damage often occurs; and it is also very difficult to repair and replace parts. The general farmers reflected: "New farm implements are easy to use but not easy to repair, and there is no place to replace the parts when they are broken." Therefore, strict inspections must be carried out to ensure the specifications and quality of the products; and some repair equipment should be equipped in the existing promotion stations to carry out the repair work of new-style farm implements.

Third, strengthen business management and reduce the cost of farm implements. In order to do this, it is necessary to use raw materials rationally, organize the labor force appropriately, accelerate capital turnover, improve tools, improve manufacturing technology, reward savings, and give full play to the labor enthusiasm of employees, so as to reduce the cost of farm implements and reduce the burden on farmers.

Fourth, strengthen design work. The design departments of each factory should divide the work and cooperate under unified leadership. At present, the design work of each factory has very few people, is scattered, and does not cooperate with each other. In the past two years, although more than 50 kinds of new-style farm implements have been designed, most of them are duplicated, and there is no exchange of experience, so the results are not great. Farmers' understanding of new-style farm implements is increasing day by day, and the types of requirements are increasing day by day; and the requirements vary from region to region. Therefore, the design institutions in various regions must strengthen contact, unify plans, divide the work and cooperate, and at the same time pay more attention to understanding the needs of farmers, listen to farmers' opinions, distinguish between urgency and locality, and carry out design work according to local conditions.

Fifth, the promotion work must be improved. In this year's promotion of new farm implements, in some areas, because farmers are in urgent need, there is a phenomenon of relaxing the focus and "blooming everywhere," so that the promoted farm implements have not fully played their role due to unsuitable soil quality or insufficient technical guidance. Although the promotion quantity will increase next year, the farm implement stations in various regions should still effectively grasp the focus, pay attention to studying the soil quality and farmers' purchasing power, and determine the promotion areas and scope according to the strength of the cadres. Attention should also be paid to organizing and mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, cooperating with various relevant departments, doing a good job in publicity, demonstration work, and technical instruction, so that the lent farm implements can play their role and achieve the purpose of increasing production. This winter, each station must seize the time to carry out technical inspections universally and deeply, solve the problems in the promotion, and prepare a more favorable foundation for the promotion work next year.

    大力供应农民新式农具提高农业生产力
    王大明  杨茂武
    广大农民迫切要求新式农具
    两年来新式农具的推广工作，已有了初步成绩。据已有材料统计，到目前为止，据不完全的统计，在全国范围内推广新式农具七万七千二百六十九件。按照各地农民对新式农具多是伙贷伙用的情况推算，现在使用新式农具的农民，起码已有十万户以上。在推广出去的各种农具中，步犁占百分之六十八，中耕农具（铲趟机和耘锄）占百分之十七，苏联式马拉农具占百分之十二，加工农具（打稻机、铡草机、玉米脱粒机等）占百分之二。此外，还有少量其他农具。推广地区，除东北比较普遍外，在关内约有四百八十多县。今年比去年扩大了百分之一百七十多。在各推广地区，新式农具受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。如今年河南省一次人民代表会议上，关于新式农具的提案计有八十多件，占农业生产方面的总提案数的百分之二十五。陕西省关中地区虽然已贷出了一万多件新式农具，仍然感到不敷分配。甘肃省张掖县的农民贷到了新式农具，认为是“喜气临门”，当新式农具运到村时，农民敲锣打鼓，感谢人民政府。察哈尔省在一个春季，就把准备全年推广的全部农具贷放完了。河北省武安县第三区一个区，就贷出了步犁一千张。许多地区，都已无法满足农民对于新式农具的迫切要求。
    使用新式农具是提高生产力的
    重要因素
    使用新式农具可以提高农业生产力，两年来已为农民的切身经验所证明。深耕可以充分利用地层下面的肥沃土壤，是农业增产的重要条件。新式步犁一般比旧犁能深耕二、三吋；也就是说，用新式步犁耕地，可以多利用二、三吋土的肥力。新式步犁翻土完全，可以把表土整个压在下面，既能掩盖杂草，把草沤烂，又可把地下虫和虫卵完全翻到地面上来，经日晒冰冻将其消灭。新式步犁碎土作用良好，可使土壤中含蓄适量水分，和使土壤易于吸收水分，发生抗旱抗涝作用。根据许多农户的使用经验，和中央人民政府农业部农具处鉴定组的三十六个特约户比较新旧两种犁的结果，证明使用七吋步犁，平均可增产百分之十六点八，较高的可增产百分之四十五，最低的也在百分之五以上。使用七吋步犁对于各种粮食作物都能起增产作用。据各地采用七吋步犁后的增产情况统计：陕西省泾阳县小麦可增产百分之四十五点四；山西黎城县劳动模范申玉芹的小麦每亩多收三斗，增产百分之三十一；陕西延安县玉米增产百分之三十九点四；河南扶沟县高粱增产百分之十五；平原濮阳谷子增产百分之三十七点六。对于经济作物的增产作用，据统计：使用七吋步犁后，河北邱县的棉花增产百分之二十；山西安邑棉花增产百分之三十一点三；河南许昌烟叶增产百分之十二点四。同时，七吋步犁轻便省力，较旧犁效能约高三分之一，每天能多耕地二亩到三亩；并且半劳动力、妇女都能使用。因此，七吋步犁是农民——特别是在关内平原地区的农民所最迫切需要的农具。
    东北今年试制综合号铲趟机成功后，已在农村大量推广。综合号铲趟机不仅是一种良好的中耕农具，也是一种优良的耕地农具，和犁一样可以提高单位面积产量。在使用综合号铲趟机的互助组内，旧犁都闲起来了。有的农民说：“别看买综合号铲趟机要钱多，凭它省工出活多打粮，使一年就等于白检一个。”辽东省东丰县文富村阮学顺互助组，九垧玉米地用综合号铲趟机铲趟一遍，就省了二十五个工；沈阳市郊深沟子村孙庆柏互助组一人一马，一天铲趟一点八垧地，每垧比旧犁省工三个，每天比旧犁多铲趟六亩地。各贷用户和互助组因为使用综合号铲趟机，增加了铲趟次数，对于完成丰产计划更有了信心。另外，在东北的平原地区，因地块较大，畜力较强，一年来推广苏联式马拉农具也有不少成绩。一百零四个使用苏联式马拉农具的互助组，最初只是用它开荒；在开荒中认识了马拉农具的好处后，已进一步使用它耕种熟地。黑龙江省讷河县李坤互助组，除用马拉农具开荒七十多垧外，又用它耕种了十四、五垧熟地。吉林省榆树县何凤山互助组百分之九十的熟地，都是用苏联式马拉农具种的，达到了精耕细作，增加了生产。吉林省蛟河县保安屯韩恩互助组用马拉农具耕种后，平均每垧地增产四百八十斤粮食，并且节省了十点七五个工，有了剩余劳力。农忙时，也能抽出部分劳力出外进行副业生产，大大增加了收入。
    此外，今年推广的新式农具中，还有部分三齿轻便耘锄和加工农具。这些新农具的效能比旧农具高，也已经得到充分的证实。三齿轻便耘锄小巧轻便，操作省力，一头毛驴就拉得动，半劳力也能使用。二人一驴，每天可锄二、三十亩地，比旧式锄效率高六倍到十倍。锄地的宽度也可以调节（从十一吋到二十一吋），一般作物都能适用。小铡草机切草整齐，长短可以调节，并且轻巧省力，每天可以铡草一千五百斤左右，比旧式铡刀的效率约高三倍。打稻机坚固耐用，省力省工，脱粒干净，一人一天能脱粒三千斤左右，比旧式打稻法的效率提高了六倍。玉米脱粒机分大小两种，大型的每天能打玉米一千五百斤到两千斤，小型的也能打五百斤以上。农民认为这些新式农具的确能减轻他们在使用旧农具时所感到的劳累。
    使用新式农具，发展和提高了
    农村合作互助组织，改进了耕作
    方法
    新式农具因为制造精密，质料也好，所以价格比旧农具高；在目前农村的经济条件下，一个农民不能单独购买，大都是几家合起来伙置伙用。这样，新式农具对于农村的合作互助组织的巩固和发展，也就起了一定作用。山东栖霞县七区邢家庄谢佑何互助组贷到一部新式犁后，便有五户单干户要求参加他们的互助组。山西定襄县高村原来没有一个互助组，在村里推广了步犁后，农民杨明章首先集股伙买，推动了全村，不到一个月的期间，这个村就成立了十三个互助组，贷了十三张步犁。察哈尔省百分之八十的步犁都是贷给互助组的，其中大部分组是因为共同用犁而组织起来的。有的互助组因为使用了新式犁，多打了粮食，于是巩固和提高了。如东北海伦县十七区禄生村王永珍互助组，今春因为使用新式农具，改变了组织形式，由初级互助形式的“马背地”组（这种组以马为主，规定一匹马带多少地算一份，人马不能换工），提高为人、马都评分记工的互助组；成员也由六户扩大到十一户。蛟河县韩恩互助组，由于使用了苏联式马拉农具，提高了劳动效率，使农业和副业有了比较完备的专业分工。为了发挥新式农具的效能，这个组有七户的耕地打破了地界，这样就使互助组的土地可以集中使用，劳动力更加有组织，便于发展成为更高级的农业生产合作社。
    使用新农具，不仅可以促进农村的劳动互助组织的发展、巩固和提高，并且可以改变落后的耕作方法。如吉林省榆树县何凤山互助组，使用新式农具后，大部耕地由垅作改为平作，去年平均每垧产大豆四千二百斤，比过去增产了百分之二十三点五。新疆省阿克苏区的农民使用新式农具后，把撒播改为条播，不仅节省了大量种籽，而且使农作物出苗整齐；更重要的是直接推动了一系列耕作法的改良，便于锄草和收割。
        吸取农民意见，改进制造
    技术，推广工作顺利开展
    这两年来，新式农具能够顺利推广的主要原因，一方面是在推广工作中注意吸取了农民的意见，使新式农具的设计工作和制造技术有了改进，因而质量、效能已逐步提高，适合了农民的需要；同时制造新式农具的工厂和农具推广站已有显著增加，使推广工作有了相当的物质基础。另一方面，是农民在两年间的试验使用中，已认识到了使用新式农具，的确能够省工出活，多打粮食。
    在设计制造方面，生产新式农具最多的华北农业机械总厂接受了农民的意见，改进了推广量最大的七吋步犁。这个厂最初制造的步犁，成本高，质量差，农民嫌贵、笨重、不结实，因此推广时发生了困难。华北农业机械总厂针对这些缺点加以改进，把犁辕的质料由榆木改成烘干的柞木（柞木的质量比榆木好，经过烘干，不易变形），又把长度改短，把犁柱的质料改成马钢，把犁的调节机构即深浅调节板和左右调节板改薄、改小（质料是马钢），这样就降低了成本百分之四十，而且轻便、结实。同时，又标定了零件的规格，使各个犁的零件可以互换；又在犁辕前方的深浅调节板上加了狗尾式的保险钩。这样，就减少了配换零件的困难，延长了犁的使用年限。西北农具研究所简化了五吋步犁的构造，使成本降低到原五吋步犁的四分之一，很适合西北农民购买力的情况。东北区今年总结了各种式样的铲趟机的优缺点，取长补短地创造了综合号铲趟机，使东北各地农村都能采用。这些在设计和制造工作上的改进，使新式农具更加适合农民的需要，便利了推广工作的开展。
    农具工厂和农具推广站是制造
    和推广新式农具的基础
    今年全国各地新式农具制造工厂已增加到一百六十多个（其中有一部分是私营工厂）。除华北农业机械总厂、东北的沈阳农具厂、黑龙江农具厂、佳木斯农具厂和西北农业机器制造厂等已能大量供应各种新式农具外，河南开封机械厂，察哈尔的大同、宣化、张垣三个制造厂，仿制七吋步犁都已经成功。目前还有许多地区正在建立农具工厂。这些农具工厂，给今后的制造工作准备了雄厚的力量。
    今年一年内，农具推广站已发展到八十八个，比去年增加了一倍。计华北有三十三个站，西北有二十三个站，华东的山东省、苏北区共有十三个站，中南的河南省有十个站，东北有九个站。东北除设立了农具推广站以外，还特别选定一些先进的农业生产互助组，贷给新式农具，并教会使用技术，让他们起示范作用。这种使用新式农具的互助组，去年有三十九个，今年增加到一百零四个。各地的农具推广站和使用新式农具的互助组，现在已成为推广新式农具的桥梁。据现有材料统计，今年通过农具推广站和互助组推广的新式农具，共有四万五千多件。
    制造和推广新式农具工作中
    应注意解决的几个问题
    因为新式农具的效能已被证实，所以农民对新式农具的要求越来越迫切。作好推广新式农具的工作，已是当前发展农业生产中的一个重要问题。为了很好地完成这个任务，必须注意解决以下几个问题：
    第一、应当有计划地组织和扩大新式农具的制造工作，解决新式农具的供应问题。两年来虽有不少工厂已制造了不少新式农具；但因为没有很好地加以组织，这些工厂还未能发挥生产上的潜在能力；还有一些工厂，因为不能掌握制造技术，在生产上受了损失。因此，要解决明年新式农具的供应问题，就必须：（一）把已有制造能力的各厂组织起来，分工合作。凡有制造步犁条件的，集中力量制造步犁；其他各厂可根据本身具体条件，生产中耕、加工等农具。这样分工制造，可以使制造技术更加熟练，达到增加产量和提高质量的目的。（二）系统地推广先进厂的制造经验，从绘制蓝图到制出样板的所有生产过程的经验，都应加以介绍。先进厂应帮助条件较差的各厂训练技术人员。同时，对于这些条件较差的厂，还须注意充实必要的设备。（三）各省应根据需要和可能条件，建立农具制造厂，以便就地取材，就地制造，就地推广，更快地满足农民的需要。
    第二、建立检验制度，严防粗制滥造。东北、西北、华北各地农具制造厂的产品质量，虽已逐步改进，但多未标定规格，质量仍然不高。农具贷出之后，常发生折损现象；零件的修配也很困难。一般农民反映：“新农具好使不好修，零件坏了没处换。”因此，必须严格进行检验，以保证产品的规格、质量；并应在现有的推广站配备一些修理器械，以便进行新式农具的修补工作。
    第三、加强经营管理，减低农具成本。为了这，就要合理使用原材料，适当组织劳动力，加速资金周转，改进工具，提高制造技术，奖励节约，发挥职工的劳动积极性，以降低农具成本，减轻农民负担。
    第四、加强设计工作。各工厂的设计部门，应在统一领导之下分工合作。目前各厂的设计工作，人很少，又分散，并且互不配合。两年来，虽设计了新式农具五十多种，但多数重复，又没有交流经验，成果不大。农民对于新式农具的认识日益提高，要求的种类日益增多；而且地区不同，要求也各不相同。因此，各地设计机构必须加强联系，统一计划，分工合作，同时更要注意了解农民的需要，倾听农民的意见，分清缓急，因地制宜地进行设计工作。
    第五、推广工作必须提高一步。今年的新农具推广工作，在部分地区，因为农民迫切需要，有放松重点、“遍地开花”的现象，使推广出去的农具，或因土质不合，或因技术指导不够，没有充分发挥作用。明年虽然推广数量增加，各地农具站仍应切实掌握重点，注意研究土质和农民购买力等情况，并要根据干部力量，确定推广地区和范围。还应注意组织、发动群众，依靠群众，配合各有关部门，做好宣传、示范工作和技术传授工作，使贷出的农具都能发挥作用，达到增加生产的目的。今年冬季，各站更要抓紧时间，普遍深入地进行技术检查，解决推广中的问题，为明年的推广工作准备下更有利的基础。（附图片）
