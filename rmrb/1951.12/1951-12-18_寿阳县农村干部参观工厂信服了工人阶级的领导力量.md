    Rural Cadres of Shouyang County Visit Factories and Are Convinced of the Leading Power of the Working Class

    We, twenty-eight rural cadres (all Party branch secretaries and branch committee members) from Shouyang County, Shanxi, visited many factories in Taiyuan and were convinced of the leadership of the working class.

    Originally, we had many muddled ideas, thinking: "During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the three years of the War of Liberation, who provided the grain, enlisted in the army, and supported the front lines if not the peasants? And what raw materials for the workers' production, their food, and clothing, can be separated from the peasants? How can it be said that the working class leads?" This time, we visited the steel plant, the spinning mill, and the flour mill in Taiyuan and saw such large machines turning so fast, producing so many things in just a few minutes. Compared with our peasants' production, it is really many times higher. We also saw pictures of tractors and Soviet collective farm peasants using machines for production. We realized that to move towards socialism and communism, we really cannot do without the working class.

    We must introduce the situation of large-scale machine production and the production and living conditions of Soviet collective farm peasants to the masses in the village, so that they can broaden their horizons and be convinced of the leadership of the working class. We must also mobilize everyone to organize and participate in cooperatives, strengthen the planning of agricultural production, improve production techniques, and increase the yield per unit area, so that under the leadership of the working class, we can build our China as prosperous as the Soviet Union.

    寿阳县农村干部参观工厂信服了工人阶级的领导力量
    我们山西寿阳县的二十八个农村干部（都是党支部书记和支部委员），到太原参观了很多工厂，信服了工人阶级的领导。
    原来我们有很多糊涂观念，认为：“八年抗日战争，三年自卫战争，出粮、参军、支援前线，那一样不是农民？工人生产用的原料，吃的和穿的，又那样能离开农民？怎么能说工人阶级领导？”这次到太原参观了钢铁厂、纺纱厂、面粉厂，看到那么大的机器，转得那么快，不到几分钟，就生产出那么多的东西，和我们农民的生产相比，真不知要高多少倍。我们还看了拖拉机和苏联集体农场农民使用机器生产的图片，我们认识了要走向社会主义、共产主义，离开工人阶级真不行。
    我们一定要把大机器生产的情况，和苏联集体农场农民生产、生活的情形，介绍给村里的群众，让他们开开眼界，信服工人阶级的领导。我们还要发动大家组织起来，参加合作社，加强农业生产的计划性，改进生产技术，提高单位面积产量，在工人阶级领导下，把咱中国建设得和苏联一样。
