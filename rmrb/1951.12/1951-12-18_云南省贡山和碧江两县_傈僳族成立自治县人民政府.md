Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 16th: Kunming News: The Gongshan and Bijiang counties in northwestern Yunnan Province, on the southwestern border of China, have successively established the Lisu Autonomous County People's Government.

　　Gongshan and Bijiang counties are both areas where the Lisu people live in concentrated communities, and there are also some Nu, Qiu, Tibetan, and Minjia people. The vast majority of Lisu and Nu people believe in Christianity. Before liberation, American imperialist elements, under the guise of religion, carried out long-term activities here. They provoked ethnic sentiments and created ethnic disputes, making it difficult for the minority peoples of the two counties to unite. After liberation, the People's Government correctly implemented the ethnic policy, and solved the historical disputes among the ethnic groups through consultation, mediation, and other methods, and the people of all ethnic groups have united. At the same time, the People's Government also distributed a large amount of relief grain and agricultural loans to assist the local people of all ethnic groups in restoring production. The state-owned trading company also organized trade teams to purchase local products, which greatly improved the lives of the people of all ethnic groups.

　　Due to the specific implementation of the ethnic policy of the Central People's Government, the political understanding of the Lisu, Nu, and other ethnic groups has been raised. After the religious reform movement was launched across the country last winter, the Christian believers of various ethnic groups in Gongshan, Bijiang, and Fugong counties also participated in this movement. They successively held symposiums to accuse the crimes of imperialist elements. The preachers and deacons in the church also organized themselves for study. Pei Aqian (Lisu, Christian), the deputy head of Bijiang County, personally led a work team to the countryside to promote religious reform. At present, 5,000 believers of all ethnic groups in the area have signed the reform declaration. Believers of all ethnic groups have unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely cut off ties with imperialism, work hard to produce, and build a great motherland for the people of all ethnic groups.

　　On the basis of the unity and cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups, after nine months of preparation, Gongshan and Bijiang counties successively convened people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life in September, and the Lisu Autonomous County People's Government of Gongshan and Bijiang counties were established at the conferences. After the meeting, the representatives of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life who participated in the people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups in the two counties wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. The letter said: Our people of all ethnic groups must be more united in the future, resolutely smash any new conspiracies of imperialism, and consolidate the frontier of the motherland.

    云南省贡山和碧江两县
    傈僳族成立自治县人民政府
    【新华社重庆十六日电】昆明讯：我国西南边疆、云南省西北部的贡山、碧江两县，已先后成立了傈僳族自治县人民政府。
    贡山、碧江两县都是傈僳族人民聚居地区，并有部分的怒族、俅族、藏族和民家族人民。绝大多数的傈僳族人民和怒族人民都信奉基督教。解放前，美帝国主义分子曾披着宗教外衣在这里进行过长期活动。他们挑拨民族感情，制造民族纠纷，使两县的少数民族人民互不团结。解放以后，人民政府正确地执行了民族政策，采用协商、调解等办法解决了各民族间的历史纠纷，各族人民已团结起来。同时，人民政府还发放了大批的救济粮和农业贷款，协助当地各民族人民恢复生产。国营贸易公司也组织了贸易小组收购当地的土产，大大地改善了各民族人民的生活。
    由于中央人民政府民族政策的具体实施，傈僳族、怒族等各民族人民的政治认识提高了。去年冬天全国各地展开宗教革新运动以后，贡山、碧江和福贡等县信基督教的各民族教徒也参加了这个运动。他们相继举行了控诉帝国主义分子罪行的座谈会。教会中的传教师和执事还组织起来进行学习。碧江县副县长裴阿欠（傈僳族，基督教徒）曾亲自带领工作队下乡宣传宗教革新。现在该地区已有五千名各民族教徒在革新宣言上签名。各民族教徒一致表示要坚决割断和帝国主义的联系，努力生产，建设好各民族人民的伟大祖国。
    在各民族人民团结合作的基础上，经过九个月的筹备工作，贡山、碧江两县在九月间先后召开了各民族各界人民代表会议，在会上分别成立了贡山、碧江两县傈僳族自治县人民政府。会后，参加两县各民族各界人民代表会议的各民族代表写信给毛主席。信中说：我们各族人民今后一定要更加团结，坚决粉碎帝国主义任何新的阴谋活动，巩固祖国的边疆。
