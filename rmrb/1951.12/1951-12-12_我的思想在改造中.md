    My Thoughts Undergoing Transformation
    Sun Enzhao, Director of the Industrial Raw Materials Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    My Past Erroneous Thoughts
    After graduating from Tsinghua School in Beijing at the age of twenty-two, I went to the United States to study agriculture. My initial goal was to serve the country and society in the field of agricultural science. However, I did not clarify the object of service, nor did I recognize the reactionary essence of the Northern Warlord government, which represented feudal landlords and colluded with imperialism at the time. The paths of service I envisioned were becoming a professor, an official, or an agricultural capitalist; in short, I planned to climb above the people. When I wrote my autobiography after the liberation of Nanjing, I said that I studied agriculture to help tenant farmers improve their lives. But now I must honestly admit that my purpose in studying agriculture was to climb up, and my attitude when writing the autobiography was dishonest.
    My study of agricultural science lacked a foundation in practical farming experience. I was originally a student from a landlord family, who neither toiled nor knew the five grains. Studying agriculture at an American university was also theoretical and impractical. After returning to China, I felt that continuing in this way would not have any effect, so I began to value gaining practical experience. While teaching at the school, I took students to work in the fields and often went to the countryside to learn from the peasants. However, I did not recognize the greatness of the working people at that time, nor could I live and work with them. Therefore, I could only gain some piecemeal experience and could not learn their complete set of skills. But this made me proud, thinking that my agricultural science foundation was very good, and coupled with some experience, I had become an agricultural expert with practical knowledge.
    Since I considered myself extraordinary, I looked down on everything. I thought that farmers only had experience but no theory, while general agricultural science workers only had theory but no experience; neither of them could solve problems; only I, with both theory and experience, could create everything. I styled myself as a cotton expert and took it upon myself to improve China's cotton production. This kind of thought, which disregards the object of service and is imbued with strong personal heroism, fills me with shame today.
    Two Years of Ideological Transformation
    I have been working in the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for nearly two years, combining study with practical issues in my work, and transforming my thinking, which has benefited me greatly. The first issue that struck my mind was the personnel system in the department. When the Ministry of Agriculture transferred me from Nanjing to Beijing, they did not inform me of my position or treatment. Although I did not say anything at the time, I could not help but have some doubts in my heart. It was not until I started working and studying at the Ministry of Agriculture that I realized that the People's Government employs people entirely based on the needs of the people and requires everyone to abandon individualistic ideas. Whether we can wholeheartedly serve the people is tested first by whether we obey the government's assignment of work and whether we talk about treatment. From this, I also realized that when personal interests conflict with the interests of the people, personal interests should be sacrificed and the interests of the people should be obeyed. In my work, because I value personal interests, I often have a bias towards valuing cotton and neglecting other industrial raw materials. This is also inconsistent with the task assigned to me by the people.
    The new records of peasants increasing cotton yield per unit area is another issue that struck my mind. In the past, I thought that only agricultural research institutions could improve cotton varieties and cotton cultivation methods. Only after improved varieties and methods were researched and then farmers were guided to do as they were told could the increase in yield per unit area be realized. Farmers could only be "made to follow, not made to understand," and it was impossible for them to find solutions themselves. I looked down on the working people in this way because I myself had not participated in labor. It was not until I saw cotton-planting labor models Qu Yaoli, Liang Jiarui, and others create bumper harvest records unprecedented in Chinese history that I truly realized the greatness of the working people. People once praised me as the only authoritative cotton expert in the country, and I used to think so myself; but the twenty-four mu of Tuozi cotton I planted in the Quanye Farm of Southeast University in Nanjing in 1924 only produced an average of 300 jin of seed cotton per mu using the old scale, equivalent to 338 jin of the current market scale, which is only a little less than 37 percent of Qu Yaoli's bumper harvest of 920 jin per mu this year. From then on, I dared not call myself a cotton expert anymore. I am really ashamed! I should continue to learn technology and strive to combine theory and experience so as to help improve the experience of farmers.
    There is also the issue of working methods. I have been the head of agricultural agencies for many years and have developed a habit of handling affairs arbitrarily and being self-centered. I did not have enough understanding of the ability of the masses. I always thought that my wisdom surpassed others, especially my students and assistants. But after working in the Ministry of Agriculture, I gradually realized that the wisdom of the masses is stronger than mine. This spring, I wrote an article on cotton pruning. I tried to use the mass line working method that I had newly learned and presented the article to my comrades for comments. The comrades also, in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, put forward many valuable opinions, which encouraged me to study the issue more deeply and also prevented me from publishing immature papers. Now I realize that whoever says that the masses are not as good as me will be separated from the masses and will inevitably make mistakes.
    In the future, I should make redoubled efforts to study and
    transform my thinking
    My thinking has undergone some changes in the past two years, but the progress is not great and cannot keep up with the requirements of the times. The times require us scientific workers who came from the old society to play a scientific role in production and construction and serve the people well. All the scientific knowledge we have has been cultivated by the people. The people have now forgiven our past sins and are also encouraging us to work actively. How should we repay the good intentions of the people and serve the people wholeheartedly and willingly! Every one of us scientific workers must make redoubled efforts to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly transform our own thinking, and change our past selfish and self-interested wrong thinking into selfless thinking of serving the people.

    我的思想在改造中
    中央人民政府农业部 工业原料司司长  孙恩?
    过去的错误思想
    我二十二岁在北京清华学校毕业以后，就到美国去学农。当初的目的是要在农业科学方面为国家社会服务。但对服务的对象没有搞清楚，也不认识当时代表封建地主并勾结帝国主义的北洋军阀政府的反动本质。服务的途径是想当教授，做官或做农业资本家；总之，都是打算爬到人民的头上。南京解放以后我写自传时，曾说我因为要帮助佃农改善生活才学农。但现在我应该老老实实地承认：学农的目的是要向上爬，写自传时的态度是不老实的。
    我学习农业科学，是没有农事经验做基础的。我原是一个出身于地主家庭，四体不勤、五谷不分的学生。在美国大学里学农，也是纸上谈兵，不切实际。回国以后我感觉到长期这样搞下去，不会发生任何作用，于是开始重视吸取实地经验。我在学校里一面教课，一面带学生到田间工作，并时常下乡向农民学习。虽然如此，我当时并不认识劳动人民的伟大，也不能和他们在一起生活和工作。因此，只能得到一些零碎的经验，不能学会他们的整套本领。但是这就使我骄傲起来了，以为自己的农业科学基础很好，又加上一些经验，已经成为有实学的农业专家了。
    我既自命不凡，也就看轻一切。以为农民单有经验，没有理论；而一般农业科学工作者只有理论没有经验，他们都不能解决问题；惟有理论经验齐全的我，才能创造一切。我自命为棉作专家，并以改进我国棉产为己任。这种不择服务对象，和浓厚的个人英雄主义的思想意识，在今天看来，真使我惶愧万分。
    两年来的思想转变
    我参加中央人民政府农业部工作将近两年，结合着工作中的实际问题进行学习，改造思想，得着很多的好处。头一个打动思想的问题是机关中的用人制度。农业部从南京调我到北京工作时，并没有告知职务和待遇。当时我虽不言语，心中不免有些疑虑。直到到农业部工作和学习后，才知道人民政府用人，完全根据人民的需要，并要求各人放弃个人自由主义的思想意识。我们能不能诚心诚意地为人民服务，第一个考验，就看我们是不是听从政府分配工作，讲不讲待遇。从此我也体会到个人利益和人民利益发生冲突时，应该牺牲个人利益，服从人民利益。我在工作中因为重视个人兴趣，常发生重视棉花，轻视其他工业原料的偏向。这也是不合乎人民所分配给我的任务的。
    农民提高棉花单位面积产量的新纪录，是打动我的思想的又一问题。过去我以为只有农业研究机关才能改良棉花品种和改良棉花的栽培方法。只有在良种和良法研究出来以后，指导农民照做，才能实现单位面积产量的提高。农民只“可使由之，不可使知之”，他们是不可能自己找出办法来的。我这样看不起劳动人民，是因为我自己没有参加过劳动的原故。直到看到植棉劳动模范曲耀离、梁家瑞等创造了我国历史上从来没有过的丰产纪录以后，才使我真正认识到劳动人民的伟大。人家推崇过我为全国仅有的棉花权威专家，我过去也曾这样自许的；而我一九二四年在南京东南大学劝业农场内所种的二十四亩脱字棉，每亩平均仅出产籽棉老秤三百斤，折合市秤三百三十八斤，才及曲耀离今年每亩九百二十斤丰产的百分之三十七弱。从这以后，我不敢再自居为棉花专家了。实在惭愧得很！我应当继续学习技术，努力于理论和经验的结合，俾能帮助农民经验的提高。
    还有一个工作方法的问题。我做过多年的农业机关的负责人，已经养成了一种独断独行唯我独尊地处理事务的习惯，对于群众的能力认识不够。我总以为我的智慧超过别人，特别是我的学生和佐理人员。但是到农业部工作以后，渐渐地认识了群众的智慧比我强。今春我写过一篇关于棉花整枝的文章，试用我新学会的走群众路线的工作方法，把这文章提出来请同志们提意见。同志们也本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，提出很多的宝贵意见，鼓励了我更加深入地研究问题，也阻止了我去发表不成熟的论文。现在我体会到：谁说群众不如我，谁就会脱离群众，也就必然地会犯错误。
    今后应当加倍努力学习，
    改造思想
    两年来我的思想已经有了些转变，但是进步不大，赶不上时代的要求。时代要求我们从旧社会出来的科学工作者，在生产建设中发挥科学的效能，好好为人民服务。我们所有的一些科学知识，都是人民培植出来的。人民现在宽恕了我们过去的罪恶，还鼓励我们积极工作，我们应该怎样地报答人民的好意，衷心悦服地为人民服务！我们每一个科学工作者都必须加倍努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，彻底改造自己的思想，把自己过去的自私自利的错误思想，改变为大公无私的为人民服务的思想。
