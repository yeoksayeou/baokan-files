Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: British "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom: At the meeting of both delegations on November 29th, the Korean and Chinese representatives made a righteous and stern speech, refuting the U.S. representatives to the point where they were left speechless. The Korean and Chinese representatives suggested reducing the level of military forces in Korea after the signing of the armistice agreement. They told the U.S. side that the hypocritical phrases of "maintaining the status quo" and "lasting armistice" were used to mask the U.S. side's true intention - to facilitate their resumption of hostile actions at an appropriate time. The Korean and Chinese representatives posed a straightforward question to Joy: "Do you want to reduce your military forces?" Joy failed to answer this question. The Korean and Chinese representatives refuted the U.S. arguments completely. They told Joy that the basic issue of preventing the recurrence of war was not mentioned in the wording of the agenda. What was the reason for this? Because when the Korean and Chinese side wanted to discuss such issues - including the withdrawal of all foreign troops - the U.S. side insisted on "only discussing military armistice issues." Therefore, this issue was listed in the fifth agenda item - making recommendations to the governments of both sides. Now the U.S. side feels that it is appropriate for them to raise certain aspects of this issue, so they have put forward a set of self-contradictory proposals at the meeting. They demanded the right to discuss the increase or maintenance of the status quo of military forces and supplies, but claimed that they had no right to discuss the withdrawal of their troops. They unreasonably demanded the expansion of the discussion on "measures to prevent the recurrence of war," but were unwilling to discuss the decisive measures to prevent the recurrence of war - the withdrawal of troops.

The Korean and Chinese side told Joy that the U.S. proposals were unworkable, first of all because it is impossible to prevent the recurrence of war by maintaining the military status quo in a state of war. Steps must be taken to eliminate the state of war. To achieve this goal, military forces must be reduced. Nam Il told Joy, "We do not believe that both sides should continue to increase military forces and supplies. On the contrary, we believe that foreign troops and equipment should be withdrawn in order to truly reduce military forces and supplies in Korea."

In the past few days, many United Nations reporters have reported from the front lines that U.S. soldiers are eager to know if they will have to fight for another thirty days. There are now many signs that the morale of the U.S. military is about to drop to zero.

　　英国工人日报记者报道：
　　二十九日会议上我方的发言
    把美方的论据驳得体无完肤
　 【新华社一日讯】英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿自板门店报道：十一月二十九日朝中代表在双方代表团会议上作了义正词严的发言，驳斥得美方代表理屈词穷。朝中代表建议在停战协议签字后减低在朝鲜的军事力量的水平。他们告美方说，虚伪的
    “维持现状”和“持久停战”的词句，是用来掩饰美方的真正意图——便利他们在适当时候重新采取敌对行动。朝中代表向乔埃提出一个直截了当的问题：“你想不想减少你们的军事力量呢？”乔埃未能答复这个问题。朝中代表把美方的论据驳斥得体无完肤。他们告乔埃说：议程的措辞中没有提到防止战争再起的这个基本问题。这是由于什么原因呢？因为当朝中方面想要讨论这种问题——包括撤退一切外国军队在内——时，美方坚持“只讨论军事停战问题”。因此，这个问题被列在第五项议程——向双方有关各国政府提出建议。现在美方感到把这个问题的某些方面提出来对他们合适，因此就又在会议上提出一套自相矛盾的建议。他们要求有权讨论军事部队和供应品的增加或维持原状的问题，但又声称他们无权讨论他们的军队的撤退问题。他们无理地要求扩大讨论“防止战事再起的措施”，但又不愿讨论防止战事再起的决定性措施——撤退军队。
    朝中方面告乔埃说，美方的建议是行不通的，这首先是因为，想要在战争状态中保持军事现状，那是无法防止战事再起的。必须采取步骤消除战争状态。为了达到这个目的，那就必须减少军事力量。南日告乔埃说，“我们不认为双方应继续增加军事力量和供应品。相反，我方认为，外国军队和装备应该撤退，以便确实减少在朝鲜的军事力量和供应品。”
    过去数天，许多联合国记者从前线报道说：美军急于知道他们是不是要再打三十天。现在有许多迹象证明，美军士气已快低落到零度了。
