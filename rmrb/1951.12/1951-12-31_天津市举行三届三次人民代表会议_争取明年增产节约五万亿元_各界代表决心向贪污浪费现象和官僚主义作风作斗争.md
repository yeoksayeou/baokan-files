Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 30th: The Tianjin Municipal Third Session of the Third People's Representative Conference concluded on the 30th after four days. The main focus of this conference was to discuss how to launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, and to oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

The conference heard Mayor Huang Jing's report on "Problems of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, and Opposing Corruption, Opposing Waste, and Opposing Bureaucracy." Huang Jing pointed out that in the nearly three years since the liberation of Tianjin, state-owned factories in the city have made considerable achievements through democratic reform and improved management. However, there are still many shortcomings, mainly unbalanced progress; emphasis on production but neglect of management; a lack of reliance on the working class and insufficient implementation of the mass line; and insufficient attention to safety and health education and equipment. In carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, we must make full use of existing conditions and overcome these shortcomings. Huang Jing also put forward five requirements for future work: 1. Fulfill and exceed the targets for increasing production and practicing economy, and decide that state-owned and public industrial, trade, financial, and transportation units in the city will increase production and practice economy by 5 trillion yuan in 1952. 2. Improve operation and management systems and lay the foundation for economic accounting. 3. Conscientiously improve safety and health equipment to reduce accidents to a minimum, and even eliminate them completely. 4. Establish a factory fund system and a production bonus system, and carry out necessary worker welfare programs. 5. Consolidate the democratic management system and conscientiously implement the working method of following the mass line. Huang Jing also hoped that private enterprises would learn from the experience of state-owned enterprises in improving operation and management, formulate plans to increase production and practice economy, save working capital, and put production surpluses as much as possible into expanded reproduction, and transfer social idle funds and all stagnant funds to industrial production. Regarding the launch of the movement to oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy, Huang Jing said: At present, all units have made arrangements, established organizations for economy inspection committees, and have begun to study documents and carry out ideological preparation. Many people have confessed and reported some corruption incidents, and some people in the business community have also confessed and reported bribery. However, some people still do not fully understand the great significance of this movement, thinking that corruption is a minor matter and that launching such a large-scale movement is "making a mountain out of a molehill"; some people express surprise, wondering why the staff of the people's government would also be corrupt; some units have suppressed democracy; and some people have adopted a liberal attitude. He criticized these erroneous ideas and incorrect attitudes, and called on everyone to actively participate in this movement. Representatives from all walks of life launched a serious discussion on Huang Jing's report, and unanimously agreed that the movement to increase production and practice economy and to oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy should be launched immediately throughout the city. Worker representatives expressed full confidence in completing the 1952 plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and resolved to wage a relentless struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Bian Jieqing, a representative of the business community and chairman of the private Hengyuan Yarn Factory, said: We should immediately respond to the government's call and participate in this movement. He said: Hengyuan has already formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy by 1,001 billion yuan, and will strive for greater achievements in the future.

    天津市举行三届三次人民代表会议
    争取明年增产节约五万亿元
    各界代表决心向贪污浪费现象和官僚主义作风作斗争
    【新华社天津三十日电】天津市第三届第三次各界人民代表会议进行四天，已在三十日闭幕。这次会议主要是讨论了如何开展增产节约和反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动。
    会议听取了市长黄敬“关于增产节约及反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的问题”的报告。黄敬指出：天津解放将近三年来，全市国营工厂经过民主改革和改进管理，已有了相当成绩。但还有不少缺点，主要是进度不平衡；重生产，轻经营；缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想，群众路线贯彻得不够；对安全卫生教育和安全卫生设备重视不足。在开展增产节约运动中，我们要充分利用已有的条件，克服这些缺点。黄敬并提出今后工作的五项要求：一、完成和超过增产节约数字，决定全市国营、公营工业、贸易、金融、交通等单位在一九五二年增产节约五万亿元。二、健全经营和管理制度，奠定经济核算制的基础。三、切实改善安全卫生设备减少事故到最低限度，以至完全消灭。四、建立工厂基金制度和生产奖励制度，举办必要的工人福利事业。五、巩固民主管理制度，认真贯彻走群众路线的工作方法。黄敬并希望私营企业学习国营企业各种改善经营管理的经验，订出增产节约计划，节约流动资金，把生产盈余尽量放在扩大再生产上，把社会游资和一切呆滞的资金也转到工业生产上来。关于开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，黄敬说：目前各单位都作了布置，建立了节约检查委员会的组织，并已开始学习文件和进行思想酝酿，更有不少人已坦白和检举了一些贪污事件，工商界也有些人坦白和检举了行贿的行为。但是仍有些人对这一运动的重大意义认识不足，以为贪污是小事情，开展这么大规模的运动是“小题大作”；有些人表示很惊讶，觉得为什么人民政府的工作人员也会有贪污；有些单位有压制民主的现象；有些人采取自由主义的态度。他对这些错误思想和不正确的态度作了批判，并号召大家积极参加这一运动。各界代表对黄敬的报告展开了认真的讨论，一致认为应立即在全市范围内展开增产节约和反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动。工人代表们表示有充分的信心完成一九五二年的增产节约计划，并坚决向贪污、浪费、官僚主义作无情的斗争。工商界代表、私营恒源纱厂董事长边洁清表示：应该马上响应政府号召，参加这一运动。他说：恒源已经订出了一千零一亿多元的增产节约计划，今后还要争取更大的成绩。
