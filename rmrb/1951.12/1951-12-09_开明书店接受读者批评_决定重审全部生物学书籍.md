    Kaiming Bookstore Accepts Readers' Criticism
    Decides to Re-examine All Biology Books
    Editor: The letter from Comrade Liu Baoxiang, "Eliminate Idealistic Viewpoints in Biology," published in the People's Daily on November 22nd, raised very correct points.  In the past, when checking old books in stock, our bookstore also paid attention to this aspect, but our work was not thorough enough, so that such errors still existed in "Insect Tales." We have now decided to re-examine all published biology books so that we can revise them in time for reprint. We hope readers will give us more guidance and criticism.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    开明书店接受读者批评
    决定重审全部生物学书籍
    编辑同志：十一月二十二日人民日报发表了刘宝祥同志“清除生物学中的唯心论观点”的来信，其中所提意见很正确。我店过去在检查旧存书籍的时候，对这方面虽也曾加注意，可是我们的工作还做得不够周密，以致“昆虫漫话”里还存在着这样的错误。我们现在决定再一次检查已经出版的所有生物学书籍，以便在重版时及时加以修正。希望读者多给我们指教和批评。    开明书店总管理处
