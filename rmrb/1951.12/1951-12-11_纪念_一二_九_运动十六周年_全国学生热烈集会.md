    Youth and students in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing and other cities also held grand commemorative gatherings. At these meetings, the heads of the local Communist Youth League work committees and student federations made reports, calling on young students from all walks of life to respond to the call of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and strive to continue to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, expand production and practice economy, and carry out ideological transformation. Some meetings also invited young combat heroes from the People's Liberation Army or young combat heroes from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who had returned home, and young worker role models to speak.
