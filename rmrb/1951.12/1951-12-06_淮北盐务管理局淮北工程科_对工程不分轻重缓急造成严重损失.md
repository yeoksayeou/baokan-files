    Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau Huaibei Engineering Section
    Disregards Urgency of Projects, Causing Serious Losses
    To the Editor: The Huaibei Engineering Section of the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau planned to repair the tide barrier dam project of the Huaibei Guanxi Salt Field in late April this year, and had decided to have more than 1,000 migrant workers from Yangji District undertake the work. However, Zhang Shuyi, the section chief of the Engineering Section, did not carry out the project construction according to the urgency of the projects, but instead assigned the batch of migrant workers to repair the highway project from Yangqiao to Dade Seven Embankment. At that time, the responsible cadre of the Engineering Section allowed the highway project to continue because the migrant workers had already set up sheds and started working. The highway project took half a month to complete. By this time, it was approaching the wheat harvest season, coupled with rain and tides, so the dam project of the Guanxi Salt Field was delayed. Later, despite several attempts to rush the repairs, the project ultimately could not be completed during the mid-July lunar calendar high tide season. From August 19th, strong winds blew for five consecutive days, and the tide did not recede due to the wind. On the evening of the 23rd, Guanxi Salt Field, lacking the tide barrier dam, saw all but 476 salt pans, which were spared due to their higher elevation, flooded, and the embankment (Dawei River and depressions) project was completely destroyed, with a silted area reaching more than 22,000 zhang. I believe that these losses were caused by the Engineering Section's failure to prioritize urgent projects. I hope the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau will seriously handle this matter and give the responsible cadres of the Engineering Section and Zhang Shuyi the punishment they deserve.

    淮北盐务管理局淮北工程科
    对工程不分轻重缓急造成严重损失
    编辑同志：淮北盐务管理局淮北工程科，于今年四月下旬准备修补淮北灌西盐场挡潮大堆工程，并已决定由杨集区一千余名民工担任该项工作。但工程科工程段长张树艺，没有根据工程的轻重缓急进行工程修建，却将洋桥至大德七圩的公路工程交给该批民工修筑。当时，工程科负责干部因民工已经搭棚做工，所以就听任修筑公路工程继续下去。公路工程经过半个月才修筑完成。这时，由于已接近收麦时期，加以天雨潮汛，因此灌西盐场的大堆工程遂耽搁下来。以后，虽经几次极力赶修，但该工程在夏历七月半大潮汛期终于未能完成。自八月十九日起连刮了五天大风，潮水因风吹未退，至二十三日晚上，灌西盐场因无挡潮大堆，除四百七十六份盐滩因地势较高幸免外，其余四百六十份盐滩都被潮水冲成了一片汪洋，并将圩洼（大圩河和洼地）工程全部冲毁，淤塞面积竟达二万二千多丈。我认为造成这些损失，是工程科不重视急办工程的结果。希望淮北盐务管理局郑重处理，对工程科负责干部和张树艺给予应得的处分。
