To the Editor:

The leading cadres of the Jinan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau do not delve deeply into their work, and they lack political education for cadres in ordinary times. Therefore, between January and October of this year, the bureau experienced seventeen cases of embezzlement and corruption. Wang Renping, an inspector in the Jinan Taxation Bureau's Direct Tax Section, colluded with private merchants soon after taking office last June, accepted bribes, and shielded private merchants from smuggling and tax evasion. Sometimes, he also acted high-handedly, arbitrarily punishing and beating merchants. Such serious incidents occurred for several months, but the leading cadres of the Taxation Bureau were unaware. They mistakenly believed that "with the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, cadres will not have problems." Most of the seventeen embezzlement and corruption cases that occurred this year were reported by the masses, and very few were discovered by the Taxation Bureau itself. Even more serious is that the leading cadres of the Taxation Bureau have never held a meeting to use these examples to educate the cadres in a timely manner, and eleven cases of embezzlement and corruption were suppressed for more than half a year before being dealt with. Therefore, this tolerant attitude towards embezzlement and corruption has created a very bad influence among the general cadres. Some reflected that: "Committing a mistake is like staying in a sanatorium; not working, but still receiving supplies." I believe that the long-standing bureaucratic work style and disregard for political tendencies of the leading cadres of the Jinan Municipal Taxation Bureau are important reasons for the continuous occurrence of embezzlement and corruption among the bureau's staff. The responsible cadres of the Jinan Municipal Taxation Bureau must conduct a profound review of their leadership style in order to improve their work and eliminate embezzlement and corruption.

    济南市税务局
    发生贪污腐化事件十七起  领导干部官僚主义应作检讨
    编辑同志：济南市人民政府税务局领导干部工作不深入，平时对干部缺乏政治教育，因此，今年一月到十月间这个局曾经先后发生贪污、腐化事件十七起。济南税务局直接税科检查员王仁平，去年六月到职不久，就和私商勾结，接受贿赂，并包庇私商走私漏税，有时还作威作福，任意处罚打骂商人。像这样严重的事件，虽然发生了好几个月，但税务局领导干部并不知道，他们错误地认为“抗美援朝了，干部不会有问题。”今年发生的十七起贪污、腐化事件，大都由群众告发，很少是税务局发现的。更严重的是税务局的领导干部从来没有召开过一次会议，拿这些事例及时对干部进行教育，并且有十一件贪污、腐化案件压了半年以上才处理。因此，这种宽容贪污、腐化的行为，在一般干部当中，造成了很坏的影响。有的反映说：“犯了错误等于住休养所；不工作，还拿供给。”我认为济南市税务局领导干部长期存在的官僚主义作风和不问政治倾向，是造成这个局的工作人员连续发生贪污、腐化事件的重要原因。济南市税务局的负责干部必须对自己的领导作风进行深刻的检讨，以便改进工作，杜绝贪污、腐化的现象。    　牧　向
