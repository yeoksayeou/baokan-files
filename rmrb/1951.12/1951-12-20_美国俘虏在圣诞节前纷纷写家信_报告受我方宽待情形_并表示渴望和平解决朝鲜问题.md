Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 19th: Our correspondent reports: Christmas is approaching, and American prisoners of war in the prisoner of war camps of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in northern Korea are sending letters home to their families in America, reporting the kind treatment they receive from the Korean and Chinese People's forces and expressing their desire to return home and reunite with their loved ones soon.

Prisoner Dunham wrote to his parents, saying: Our life here is not bad. We often have meat, canned food, and sugar to eat, and we also receive various daily necessities, warm cotton clothing, and blankets. Everyone is very satisfied with this humanitarian treatment. He continued: "We often play games and sing, which shows that we are also happy in spirit. We had a feast on Thanksgiving. Now we are preparing for Christmas."

Another prisoner, Eaton, wrote to his parents: "Our generals said that if we were captured by the Chinese, we would be killed. But the opposite is true. They (referring to the Korean and Chinese forces) are trying their best not to let us die or get sick. Because I weakened my physical strength in that cursed war, I got sick in the battle in which I was captured, and the illness seemed very serious for a while. After the kind Chinese captured me, they sent me to the hospital for treatment for three months, and I received good medicine and diet. The enthusiastic Chinese doctors took care of me day and night until I was out of danger of death. I am very grateful to them for saving my life."

Many prisoners unanimously urged their relatives and the people at home to immediately demand that the US government show genuine sincerity in the armistice negotiations so that the Korean armistice negotiations can be successful as soon as possible. A prisoner who did not want to be named wrote in his letter: "I hope dear Dad and Mom can write to the congressmen and question them why they don't let us go home sooner. We Americans have no reason to interfere in the affairs of the Koreans. The people of China and Korea are as peace-loving as the people of the United States. They have not and will never use warships and planes to invade our country. I am increasingly aware that this war launched by our government far away from our country is too dirty and hateful. I believe that as long as the majority of the American people wake up and express their opinions, this bloody war that slaughters human beings will stop immediately."

D'Loda also wrote to his friend: "I hope you will loudly appeal to the government that as long as our government and generals are sincerely willing to stop this hopeless war, then the war can be stopped immediately. Let us pray to God that peace in Korea will come quickly with Christmas!"

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: TASS, Pyongyang, December 15th: "Labor News" published some letters from American prisoners of war, in which the prisoners of war described their humane treatment and expressed their desire for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

George Klein, a soldier of the US Second Division, wrote to his mother in California, saying: "I am in good health and living in peace. Contrary to what our officers said, people treat us very well. We eat three meals a day, sleep on warm Korean kangs, and doctors come to see us every day."

Soldier George Glenn wrote to his mother: "The American soldiers here all hope that the ceasefire negotiations will be completed smoothly. The end of the war will bring us happiness."

Some American prisoners of war mentioned the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea in their letters home. For example, Sergeant Krone of the US Seventh Division said in a letter to his wife: "The Americans ruthlessly destroy Korean cities and villages and massacre the people. This is really sinful. The United States should not fight this war that brings misfortune to mankind again."

    美国俘虏在圣诞节前纷纷写家信
    报告受我方宽待情形
    并表示渴望和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社平壤十九日电】本社记者报道：圣诞节快要到了，在朝鲜北部朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军俘虏营里的美国俘虏们纷纷向他们在美洲的家属发出平安家信，报告他们受到朝中人民部队的宽待，和他们渴望早日回家和亲人团聚的心情。俘虏邓哈姆写信告诉他的父母说：我们在这里的生活很不坏，常常有肉类、罐头食品和糖吃，并且还领到了各种日用品、温暖的棉衣和毯子；无论是谁，对这种人道的待遇都是万分满意的。他继续说：“我们还常常做游戏和唱歌，这表现出我们在精神上也是愉快的。在感恩节那天，我们会了餐。现在我们正准备着过圣诞节。”另一个俘虏伊顿给他的父母的信上写道：“我们的将军们曾说，假使被中国人捉去是要被杀死的。但事实完全相反，他们（指朝中部队）正努力不使我们死亡或生病。因为我在该诅咒的战争中削弱了体力，在我被俘的那次战斗中就生了病，并且病情一时显得很严重。好心的中国人俘掳了我以后就把我送到医院里治疗了三个月，我得到了良好的医药和饮食。热心的中国医生日夜看护着我，直到我脱离了死亡的危险。我十分感谢他们救活了我的性命。”许多俘虏们在信上一致敦促自己的亲人和国内人民立即要求美国政府拿出真正的诚意来进行停战谈判，使朝鲜的停战谈判早日成功。一个不便公布姓名的俘虏在他的信上写道：“我希望亲爱的爸爸、妈妈能给国会议员写信，质问他们为什么不让我们早一天回家来。我们美国是毫无理由来干涉朝鲜人的事情的。中国、朝鲜的人民和美国的人民一样是爱好和平的。他们并没有、也决不会用军舰和飞机来侵犯我们的国家。我愈来愈认识到我们政府发动的这个远离本国的战争是太肮脏太可恨了。我相信只要美国多数人民觉醒起来，并表示他们的意见，这个屠杀人类的血腥战争便会马上停止。”德罗达也在给朋友的信中写道：“希望你们向政府大声呼吁，只要是我们的政府和将军们真心愿意停止这个毫无前途的战争，那么战争是马上可以停止的。让我们向上帝祈祷朝鲜的和平快快随着圣诞节光临吧！”
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社平壤十五日讯：“劳动新闻”发表了美国战俘的一些信件，战俘们在信中叙述了他们受到人道待遇的情形，并表示渴望和平解决朝鲜问题。
    美国第二师士兵乔治·克莱因写信去加利福尼亚，对他的母亲说：“我身体健康，生活平安。和我们的军官说的恰相反，人家待我们很好。我们一天吃三顿饭，睡在朝鲜的暖和的炕上，每天有医生来看我们。”
    士兵乔治·格伦写信给他的母亲说：“这里的美国士兵都希望顺利完成停火谈判。战争的结束，将带给我们幸福。”
    有些美国战俘在家信中提到美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行。例如：美国第七师中士克隆在写给他的妻子的信中说：“美国人无情地破坏朝鲜的城市和村庄，屠杀人民。这实在是罪恶。美国不应该再打这个给人类带来不幸的仗。”
