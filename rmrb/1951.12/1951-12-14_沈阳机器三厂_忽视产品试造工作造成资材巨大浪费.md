    Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 3
    Neglecting Product Trial Manufacturing Leads to Huge Waste of Resources

    Leading cadres of the Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 3 treated the trial manufacturing of six new products with an attitude of pretending to understand when they didn't. They manufactured while trial-manufacturing; they even mass-produced without trial manufacturing at all. This practice caused the plant to lose 2.39 billion yuan and incur debts of 4.1 billion yuan in half a year (from April to September this year).

    After accepting a new product assignment, the leading cadres only wanted to start mass production as soon as possible, so they ordered the technical staff to design tools for mass production before the trial manufacturing work was completed. The workers had opinions about this practice and did not work hard. Instead of studying these problems, the leading cadres criticized the workers for not working hard enough. The result of manufacturing and producing simultaneously was that not only was the trial manufacturing work not done well, but also the production work suffered great losses. Forty-six parts (about 71% of the total) were modified nine times, with a total of 84 kinds of problems corrected. More than half of the tools that had been produced became useless. Moreover, because mass production was started before the trial manufacturing was successful, a total of 29,070 parts were scrapped due to drawing changes, worth more than 285.63 million yuan in RMB. At the same time, work hours were wasted, the production process was prolonged, and the unit cost was twice as high as the selling price on the order contract, causing the factory to lose more than 2.06864 billion yuan. When producing bench drills, the technical department of the plant did not complete the task, and the leading cadres ordered the manufacturing department to manufacture while trial-manufacturing. It was not until 120 units had been manufactured that it was discovered that the trial-manufactured product was the same as the waste product. The total loss amounted to approximately 218 million yuan in RMB. In addition, more than 60 scrapped parts have not been included in the calculation.

    When manufacturing the orders for four types of master machines, production began without trial manufacturing. The leading cadres believed that the quantity was small, and if the trial manufacturing was successful, the task would be completed, so trial manufacturing work could be omitted. However, during assembly, the workers discovered errors in the design drawings. The drawings had to be changed by the client, which took time, and production was often interrupted as a result. The production time was prolonged, and there was a loss of 32.017 million yuan between the selling price and the cost.

    The reason for the failure of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 3 in manufacturing six new products was mainly that the leading cadres had a blind sense of complacency and were unwilling to learn honestly. When producing bench drills, the leading cadre of the manufacturing department first believed that the bench drills could definitely be made well. The workshop director also believed: "With such a large factory and such good equipment, our workshop guarantees completion." With such a dishonest attitude towards the trial manufacturing of new products, failure was inevitable. (Liu Xing)

    沈阳机器三厂
    忽视产品试造工作造成资材巨大浪费
    沈阳机器三厂领导干部，以不懂装懂的态度对待六种新产品的试造工作。他们一面试造，一面制作；甚至不经试造就大量制造。这种做法使这个厂半年来（今年四月到九月）赔损二十三亿九千万元，负债四十一亿元。
    领导干部在接受某种新产品任务以后，只想早一天大量生产，在试造工作还没有完成的时候，就叫技术人员设计大量生产时用的工具。工人们对这种做法有意见，就不使劲生产。领导干部不仅不研究这些问题，反而批评工人不努力生产。一面试造和一面生产的结果，不但试造工作没有搞好，生产工作也受到了很大损失。有四十六件部件（约占全数的百分之七十一）经过九次修改，共改了八十四种毛病。已生产出来的工具，有一半以上都失去了效用。更因为在没有试造成功的时候就大量生产，所以生产出来的部件因改图而报废的总计有二万九千零七十件，值人民币二亿八千五百六十三万多元。同时，浪费了工时，拖长了生产过程，单位成本较定货合同上的出售价格增高一倍，使工厂亏损二十亿六千八百六十四万多元。生产台钻时，这个厂的技术科没完成任务，领导干部又命令制造科一面试造一面生产。直到已经制造出了一百二十个，才发现试造出的成品和废品一样。总计损失约合人民币二亿一千八百万元。另外，报废的六十几件部件，还没有计算在内。
    在制造四种母机的定货时，没有经过试造就开始生产。领导干部认为：数量少，试造成功了，也就完成任务了，可以不进行试造工作。可是在装配时，工人发现了设计的图纸有错误。改图纸得由货主来改，这就需要耽误一些时间，生产常常因为这而间断。生产时间拖长了，在出售价格和成本上，又亏损了三亿二千零一十七万元。
    沈阳机器三厂制造六种新产品工作失败的原因，主要是领导干部有盲目自满情绪，不肯老老实实地学习。在生产台钻时，制造科的负责干部首先认为台钻一定可以做好。车间主任也认为：“我们这样大的厂子，这样好的设备，我们车间保证完成。”用这样不老实的态度来对待新产品的试造工作，当然是要失败的。（柳星）
