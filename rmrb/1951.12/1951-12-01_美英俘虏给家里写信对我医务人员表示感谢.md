Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th: The Guangzhou Team of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service recently brought back two letters from American and British prisoners of war from a war hospital in Korea. One letter was from an American prisoner of war to be forwarded to his family by members of the team, and the other was a thank-you letter from a British prisoner of war to the medical staff of the team. The American prisoner of war wrote in his letter home: "I hope you are not worried about me because I am being treated very well. I have spent six weeks in a hospital run by the Chinese. They have indeed done a great job in treating my leg injuries. They treat me very well and give me all the medicine I need. All these people are very good to me, so don't believe any lies that anyone says about the Chinese mistreating prisoners of war. The sooner this war ends, the sooner I can be with you again. Therefore, you should do your best in America to stop this war." The British prisoner of war's letter of thanks said: "I am writing this letter to express my gratitude to Dr. Lin, Dr. Zeng, and the nurses for treating me in the hospital. I received the best care and treatment, which a prisoner of war could not have expected. I can walk freely around the hospital grounds. I will take back many pleasant memories and tell the British people how well I was treated, and tell the British people about the noble character and goodwill of the Chinese people."

    美英俘虏给家里写信
    对我医务人员表示感谢 【新华社广州三十日电】中国红十字会国际医疗防疫服务队广州队最近从朝鲜战地医院带回来两封美英俘虏的信件。一封是美国俘虏托该队队员转给他的家人的信，另一封是英国俘虏写给该队医务工作人员的感谢信。美国俘虏在家信里写道：“我希望你们不要为我担心，因为我受到很好的待遇。我已经在一个中国人办理的医院里过了六个星期。他们确实尽了很大的职责来治疗我的腿伤。他们待我很好，给我一切我所需要的药物。所有这些人对我都很好，因此你们不要相信有人说中国人虐待俘虏的任何谎话。这个战争越快完结，我就可以越快地跟你们再在一起。因此，你们应该在美国尽力制止这场战争。”英国俘虏的感谢信说：“我写这封信是表示我对林医生、曾医生和护士们在医院中医治我的谢意。我得到了最好的照顾和治疗，这是一个战俘所不能期望得到的。我可以在医院场地四周自由行走。我将把许多愉快的回忆带回去，告诉英国人民我曾受得多么好的待遇，并且把中国人民高尚品德和善意告诉英国人民。”
