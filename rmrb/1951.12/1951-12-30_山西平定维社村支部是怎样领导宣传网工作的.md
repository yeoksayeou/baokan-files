How the Weishe Village Branch in Pingtung, Shanxi, Leads Propaganda Network Work
中共山西省委宣传部

The Party's propaganda network in Weishe Village, Pingtung First District, was established this year. Thanks to the active efforts of propagandists, the masses' awareness has greatly improved, and all kinds of work have been done well. This village has become an advanced village. The village's Party branch has the following five outstanding good experiences in leading the propaganda network work:

First, discover the ideological problems of the masses and the problems in the work at any time, study and solve them. For example, when promoting the patriotic donation movement, the masses in the village did not understand the meaning and method of donation. Some said, "The country can issue more money; why donate?" Some women did not focus on increasing production, thinking, "To donate, we have to take money from home." In response to this situation, the branch decided to focus on publicizing why and how to donate, explaining that the country cannot print money casually, donation is everyone's patriotic expression, and it should start with increasing production. After the propagandists' publicity, the above ideological problems were quickly resolved, and a warm donation movement was launched. When the news of the Korean armistice negotiations came, many people said, "That's great, there's no need to donate anymore!" The families of soldiers thought that their loved ones would be back soon. This kind of paralysis and relaxation was common and serious. The branch immediately studied this issue and asked the propagandists to widely publicize it, emphasizing: "The United States now agrees to negotiate with us because they can't stand the fighting, not willingly. We should be vigilant. Chairman Mao said that as long as imperialism exists in the world, there will be war. Of course, we hope for peace, because peace is beneficial to us, and we should strive for it as long as there is a possibility. But no matter what, resisting America and aiding Korea must not be slackened." As a result, the problem of the masses breathing a sigh of relief was resolved, and the work of resisting America and aiding Korea was not affected. Liu Si Hai, a military family member, also wrote a letter to his son on the front line in Korea, telling him to fight well and not to be fooled by American imperialism.

Second, lead the propaganda work, closely serving production and the central work. For example, during this year's spring plowing, it happened to be dry. The branch mobilized the masses to plant seeds, persuading them not to adopt the old method of "going down to the kiln before it rains" (many farmers in the village also work in coal kilns). During the planting, badgers ate the seeds, greatly hindering the farmers' confidence in planting. At this time, they asked the village's Agricultural Technology Committee to research and find a solution, which the propagandists experimented with and publicized. As a result, the planting work was successfully completed. When mobilizing the masses to hoe four times, many people held old views, saying, "One hoe in the first heat, a bowl of oil; two hoes in the second heat, half a bowl of oil; three hoes in the third heat, for no reason," and were unwilling to do it. The branch asked the Technical Committee to research the benefits of hoeing four times: "The first hoe should be deep, the second hoe should be pitted, the third hoe should be all over, and the fourth hoe should pull the grass roots to save labor after autumn." The propagandists publicized this, and 90% of the autumn fields were hoeed four times. They also used specific examples from the village, using summary and evaluation methods, to publicize organizing and improving technology, and mobilized the propagandists to take the lead themselves, so that 72% of the village's labor force and 91% of animal power participated in mutual aid teams, and 100% of seed soaking was achieved, and meticulous farming was also achieved.

Third, lead the masses' "Patriotic Day" activities. This is the most powerful and regular method to educate the masses and promote work, and it is also an outstanding creation of theirs. "Patriotic Day" is held every half month, and it has been adhered to from May this year to the present. Its content is mainly to conduct patriotic education to the masses and check and revise patriotic covenants. All important work in the village is publicized through "Patriotic Day." The activity method of "Patriotic Day" is relaxed and pleasant: using about two hours in the evening, first engage in cultural entertainment (storytelling,快板, Yangko dance, performing small plays or small flower dramas), and then the branch secretary or village chief reports on current affairs and work, and then conducts a check or revision of the patriotic covenant. The establishment of "Patriotic Day" has promoted various tasks and achieved great results. It has become an important method for the branch and the village people's government to contact the masses. Together with the propaganda network and the village people's congress, it can enable the Party's various policies to meet directly with the people, and all work can be carried out smoothly.

Fourth, use various propaganda tools and organize various propaganda forces to carry out propaganda. Commonly used propaganda tools include loudspeakers and blackboards, and propaganda organizations include reading groups, people's schools, and entertainment teams. In order to use and lead these tools and organizations well, five groups were established: material (collecting propaganda materials), writing, reading newspapers, broadcasting, and culture, which are uniformly led by the branch to carry out their work. The heads of each group are propagandists. Each group has also united many activists, and more than 70 activists can regularly participate in the work. This unifies the propaganda power and enables the propaganda network to exert greater combat effectiveness.

Fifth, established the necessary and appropriate propagandist work system. They stipulated that a propagandist meeting should be held once every half month to study and arrange propaganda work, and propagandists should study once every five days, so the propagandists can continuously improve, be competent for their work, and have high enthusiasm. The propagandists also have clear divisions of labor. Several methods are used for division of labor: one is to assign them to various groups according to their abilities; the other is to assign them to various organizational systems according to each person's job duties; and the third is to assign them to areas and households according to their residence to be responsible for publicity (also called the contract system). The branch cares about the difficulties in the propagandists' work and often helps them solve them, especially by regularly providing them with propaganda materials. They can also hold meetings to study and specifically arrange the propaganda content transmitted by the transmission station each time, instead of rigidly publicizing it in a doctrinaire manner.

The Weishi branch leads the Party's propaganda network work in this way, so the various tasks in the village are done very well. Taking the work of giving preferential treatment to military families as an example, the land of all nine military families in the village has achieved fixed contracted cultivation, and five of them have achieved contracted cultivation and contracted production. They stipulated that they should communicate with the soldiers in the Korean front line in the village every three months to report on the situation of giving preferential treatment to military families. Now they have established direct communication with a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army in Korea. The headquarters once told them: "Your letters have inspired all the soldiers in our regiment and educated and consolidated the troops." Taking the autumn grain tax as an example, this year's autumn grain tax task was completed in only two hours. These many achievements are due to the branch's correct leadership of the propagandist work and "Patriotic Day" activities, so that the policies of the Party and the government can constantly meet with the masses, and the awareness of the masses has been greatly improved. The peasants said, "Without propagandists, our ears will be deaf, our eyes will be blind, and production will not be good." They gave the propagandists a glorious title, called "Chairman Mao's spokespersons."

    山西平定维社村支部是怎样领导宣传网工作的
      中共山西省委宣传部
    平定一区维社村的党的宣传网，是今年建立的。由于宣传员的积极活动，群众觉悟大大提高了，各种工作都搞好了。这村已经成了先进村。这村的党的支部在领导宣传网工作上，有如下五点突出的好经验：
    第一，随时发现群众的思想问题和工作中的问题，加以研究和解决。比如在推行爱国捐献运动时，村里群众不大了解捐献的意义和办法，有的说“国家多出些票子就行了，何必捐献”，有些妇女不从增产着眼，认为“要捐献得家里拿钱”。支部针对这种情况决定着重宣传为啥要捐献，怎样捐献，说明国家不能随便印票子，捐献是每个人的爱国表现，并要从增产做起。经过宣传员的宣传，迅速解决了上述的思想问题，掀起了热烈的捐献运动。在朝鲜停战谈判消息传来时，许多人说：“这下可好啦，用不着捐献啦！”军人家属则以为自己的亲人不久就可回来了。这种麻痹松懈的情绪普遍而且严重。支部当下研究了这个问题，让宣传员广泛展开宣传，着重地指出：“美国现在答应和我们谈判，是打的他受不了啦，并非心甘情愿，我们应提高警惕。毛主席说过，只要世界上还有帝国主义存在，就有战争。我们当然是希望和平的，因为和平对我们有利，只要有一点可能，我们就应争取。可是不管怎样，抗美援朝决不能松劲。”结果，群众中的松一口气的思想问题解决了，抗美援朝工作没受影响。军属刘四海还给他在朝鲜前线的儿子写信，要他好好打仗，不要上美帝国主义的当。
    第二，领导宣传工作，紧紧为生产服务，为中心工作服务。如今年春耕时，恰遇天旱，支部就发动群众点种，说服群众不要采取“天不下雨先下窑”
    （该村农民兼当煤窑工人的很多）的老办法。在点种时，獾吃种子，大大阻碍了农民群众点种的信心。这时他们就请这村的农业技术委员会研究出办法来，由宣传员作了实验并进行了宣传，结果顺利完成了点种工作。发动群众普遍锄四遍苗时，许多人抱着老观点，说是“一伏锄，一碗油，二伏锄，半碗油，三伏锄，没来由”，不愿动手。支部就请技术委员会研究出锄四遍的好处：“头锄要深，二锄要坑，三锄要遍，四锄要拉到草根，秋后耕地省工。”宣传员根据这作了宣传，秋田锄四遍的达到百分之九十。他们又以本村的具体实例，用总结评比的方法，宣传组织起来和改进技术，并发动宣传员自己带头，使全村劳力的百分之七十二、畜力的百分之九十一参加了互助组，百分之百做到浸种，还做到精耕细作。
    第三，领导群众的“爱国日”活动。这是教育群众，推动工作最有力、最经常的方法，也是他们的一个突出的创造。“爱国日”是每半月一次，自今年五月建立以来，一直坚持到现在。它的内容主要是对群众进行爱国主义教育、检查修订爱国公约。凡是村中的重要工作，都通过“爱国日”去宣传。“爱国日”的活动方式，是轻松愉快的：利用晚上的两个钟头左右的时间，先搞文化娱乐（说鼓书、快板，扭秧歌，演小剧或小花剧），然后由支部书记或村长报告目前的时事和工作，接着再进行爱国公约的检查或修订。“爱国日”的建立，推动了各种工作，成绩很大。它已经成为支部和村人民政府联系群众的一个重要方法。再加上宣传网和村人民代表会，就能使党的各项政策和人民群众直接见面，一切工作都能顺利进行。
    第四，运用各种宣传工具，组织各种宣传力量去作宣传。常用的宣传工具有广播筒、黑板报等，宣传组织有读报组、民校、文娱队等。为了把这些工具和组织很好地运用和领导起来，成立了材料（收集宣传材料）、编写、读报、广播、文化五个股，统一由支部领导进行工作。各股股长都由宣传员担任。各股又都团结了许多积极分子，能经常参加工作的积极分子有七十多人。这样就统一了宣传力量，使宣传网发挥了更大的战斗力。
    第五，建立了必要的适用的宣传员工作制度。他们规定半个月开一次宣传员会议，研究布置宣传工作，五天领导宣传员学习一次，因此宣传员能不断提高，工作都能胜任，积极性也高。宣传员也都作了明确分工。分工的方法兼用几种：一是按能力分到各股；二是按每人工作职务分到各组织系统；三是按居住地区，分片分户，负责宣传（也叫包干制）。支部很关心宣传员工作上的困难，经常帮助他们解决，特别是经常把宣传资料供给他们。对传授站上每次传授的宣传内容，他们也能作到开会研究，具体布置，而不是原封不动地教条式地去宣传。
    维社支部就是这样领导党的宣传网工作的，所以村中的各项工作都做得很出色。以优军代耕工作来说，全村九户军属的土地都做到了固定包耕，其中五户作到包耕包产。他们规定每三个月跟本村在朝鲜前线的战士通信一次，报告优军情况。现在他们已和在朝鲜的志愿军某团取得直接通信联系。团部曾告诉他们说：“你们的来信鼓舞了我们全团的战士，教育和巩固了部队。”以秋征来说，今年秋征任务，只两小时即全部完成。这许多成绩，都是由于支部正确地领导了宣传员工作和“爱国日”活动，使党和政府的政策可以不断和群众见面，群众的觉悟大大提高的缘故。农民们说：“没有宣传员，耳就要聋，眼就要瞎，生产也搞不好。”他们给宣传员一个光荣的称呼，叫做“毛主席的传话人”。
