    Oppose Bureaucracy and Establish a Scientific Work Style!
    To the Editor: After reading the news "Central Political and Legal Departments Hold Anti-Bureaucracy Document Exhibition" and related short commentaries published in the People's Daily on November 30, I further realized that bureaucracy is an irresponsible and bureaucratic work style. Its harm to work is very serious. Recently, a leading comrade from the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry personally inspected work at a factory and exposed and severely criticized this bureaucratic work style. For example, a department of a factory requested a 100-horsepower motor from a certain place. The factory actually used three signed reports, five receipts, and fourteen slips, which were approved by three deputy factory directors, two section chiefs, one department director, one office director, and ten section heads, going through a total of twenty-two official document procedures, stamped with seventy seals, and it took four months and four days to transfer the motor.
    Opposing bureaucracy is a serious ideological struggle, a struggle between the new and old work styles. In this struggle, I believe that administrative leaders at all levels should personally conduct inspections, expose, and criticize bureaucracy to eliminate this undesirable work style and establish a scientific work style.	Wan Fanghui
    To the Editor: The anti-bureaucracy document exhibition recently held by the central political and legal departments to simplify official procedures and improve work efficiency is of great significance. Today, the nation is carrying out an increase production and practice economy movement. We should not only save in material aspects but also save time. Because saving time and improving work efficiency will further promote the entire increase production and practice economy movement.	Long
    To the Editor: I believe that the anti-bureaucracy document exhibition recently held by the central political and legal organs is very necessary and timely. If all organs can also conduct thorough inspections and display various types of documents that have committed bureaucracy through exhibitions and propose reform methods, it will greatly save manpower and material resources and improve work efficiency. Therefore, I hope that government organs at all levels across the country can hold an anti-bureaucracy exhibition.	Deng Tinghuan
    Editor's Note: We ask cadres of all organs and organizations to expose the bad work style of bureaucracy. Comrade Wan Fanghui's letter is very good. We hope everyone will write letters to report and criticize various similar bureaucratic phenomena.

### 反对文牍主义，树立科学的工作作风！

    反对文牍主义，树立科学的工作作风！
    编辑同志：看了十一月三十日人民日报刊登的“中央政法部门举办反文牍主义公文展览会”的消息和有关短评以后，我进一步认识了文牍主义是不负责任的官僚主义作风。它对工作的危害性是很严重的。最近中央重工业部一位领导同志亲自到某厂检查工作，就对这种文牍主义的作风进行了揭发和严厉的批评。比如：某厂某部曾要求由某地调用一个一百马力的马达。某厂竟用了三个签呈，五个单据，十四个签条，经过三个副厂长、两个处长、一个部主任、一个室主任、十个课长的批示，共经过二十二道公文手续，盖了七十个图章，过了四个月零四天，才把马达调来。
    反对文牍主义是一个严肃的思想斗争，是新的工作作风和旧的工作作风的斗争。在这个斗争中，我认为各级行政首长应亲自动手进行对文牍主义的检查、揭发和批评，以肃清这种不良作风，树立科学的工作作风。    万方惠
    编辑同志：最近中央政法部门为了简化公文手续、提高工作效率而举办的反文牍主义公文展览会，是有重大意义的。今天全国正在开展增产节约运动，我们不只应在物质方面节约，同时也要节约时间。因为节约了时间，提高了工作效率，就会更加推进整个增产节约运动。        珑
    编辑同志：我认为中央政法机关最近举办的反文牍主义公文展览会，是非常必要而适时的。各机关如果也能够进行彻底检查，通过展览会的方式，把犯了文牍主义的各式各样公文陈列出来，并提出改革的办法，那将会大大节省人力物力，提高工作效率。因此，我希望全国各级政府机关都能举办一次反文牍主义的展览会。            邓庭焕
    编者按：我们要求各机关团体干部都来揭发文牍主义的恶劣作风。万方惠同志的来信很好。希望大家都写信来检举和批判各种类似的官僚主义的现象。
