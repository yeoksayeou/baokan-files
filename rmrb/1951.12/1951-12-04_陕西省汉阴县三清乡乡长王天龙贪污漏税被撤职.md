    Wang Tianlong, Head of Sanqing Township, Hanyin County, Shaanxi Province, Dismissed for Embezzlement and Tax Evasion
    Wang Tianlong, head of Sanqing Township in the Eighth District of Hanyin County, Shaanxi Province, has been dismissed for embezzlement and tax evasion. Wang Tianlong pretended to be active in his work and gained the trust of the masses. He became the township head in March of last year. After becoming the township head, he did whatever he wanted. When urging the payment of public grain, Wang Tianlong not only did not pay for his meals, but also demanded one liter of rice as "labor money" from the farmers each time. The People's Government, in order to promote rural sideline production, stipulated that all pigs raised for self-consumption would be exempt from taxation. However, Wang Tianlong notified the farmers that anyone who slaughtered pigs would have to hand over the pig bristles to the township office as "office expenses." Wang Tianlong himself slaughtered and sold three pigs without paying taxes, and embezzled 191,000 yuan in pig taxes paid by the farmers. In May of this year, Wang Tianlong distilled oil himself without paying taxes, and also privately distilled liquor with Hu Yanming, the head of the first neighborhood in the township. This matter was discovered by a militiaman who wanted to report it to the government, but Wang Tianlong detained him overnight. The masses said, "After liberation, it is the township head who has turned over, but we poor people have not truly turned over." At present, in addition to deciding to recover the funds embezzled and extorted by Wang Tianlong, the superior government has also submitted a request to the County People's Government for approval to give him a dismissal punishment.

    陕西省汉阴县三清乡乡长
    王天龙贪污漏税被撤职
    陕西省汉阴县第八区三清乡乡长王天龙贪污、漏税，已受到撤职处分。王天龙在工作中假装积极，骗得群众的信任，于去年三月当了乡长。他当乡长后，即为所欲为。催缴公粮时，王天龙不但吃饭不给钱，每次还要向农民索取一升大米的“工钱”。人民政府为了提倡农村的副业生产，规定凡是自己养了供自己食用的猪，概不上税。王天龙却通知农民：凡杀了猪的，要把猪鬃交到乡公所作为“办公费用”。王天龙自己杀了出卖的三口猪没有上税，并贪污了农民缴纳的猪税十九万一千元。今年五月，王天龙自己打油不上税，并和该乡第一闾闾长胡延明私自烧酒。这事被一民兵发觉，要向政府报告，王天龙就把他扣了一夜。群众说：“解放了，翻身的是乡长，咱穷人还没有真正翻身。”目前，上级政府除决定追回王天龙所贪污、勒索的款项外，并已呈请县人民政府批准，给予撤职处分。
