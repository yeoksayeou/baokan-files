Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: The governments of Bulgaria and Hungary have separately revealed the consistent aggressive activities of the United States against Bulgaria and Hungary. According to a TASS report:

    On December 3rd, the Bulgarian government released a memorandum to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, addressing President Truman's signing of the so-called "Mutual Security Act of 1951." The memorandum pointed out that this act openly declares the U.S. government's intention to support and dispatch spies or armed groups to Bulgaria to carry out sabotage and subversion. It demonstrates that the U.S. government has brazenly disregarded the UN Charter and the most basic principles of international law, and shamelessly interfered in Bulgaria's internal affairs. The memorandum listed various nefarious activities by the U.S. government over the seven years since the establishment of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, aimed at obstructing Bulgaria's political and economic development.

    On December 6th, the Hungarian government published a "White Paper." The "White Paper" listed various heinous policies and activities of the United States against Hungary, such as protecting spies and agents operating within Hungary, organizing sabotage activities, interfering in Hungary's internal affairs, and discriminating against Hungary in trade. The "White Paper" included many evidentiary documents, such as diplomatic notes regarding U.S. interference in Hungary's internal affairs, court records and defendant testimonies from the trials of Hungarian traitors Rajk, Mindszenty, and Gratz. The "White Paper" has been submitted to the United Nations Secretariat and the governments of countries that have established diplomatic relations with Hungary, and has been released to public opinion circles in various countries.

    揭露美国的间谍破坏活动
    【新华社十日讯】保加利亚和匈牙利的政府分别揭露美国对保、匈两国一贯的侵略活动。据塔斯社消息：
    保加利亚政府三日公布了致联合国大会第六届会议的备忘录，备忘录是针对美国总统杜鲁门签署所谓“一九五一年共同安全法”而提出的。备忘录指出：这个法案公开表示美国政府要支持和派遣间谍分子或武装团体到保加利亚，进行破坏和颠覆活动，它表明了美国政府已悍然不顾联合国宪章和国际法最基本的原则，无耻地干涉保加利亚的内政。备忘录中列举了美国政府在保加利亚人民政权成立七年来阻挠保加利亚的政治和经济发展的种种罪恶活动。
    匈牙利政府六日发表了一项“白皮书”。“白皮书”列举美国针对匈牙利的各种罪恶的政策与活动，例如包庇在匈牙利境内活动的间谍和特务、组织破坏活动、干涉匈牙利内政、在贸易方面歧视匈牙利等等。“白皮书”中附有许多证明文件，例如美国干涉匈牙利内政的照会、匈牙利叛国犯拉伊克、明曾蒂、格拉兹审判案中法庭的记录和被告的口供等。“白皮书”已送交联合国秘书处和与匈牙利建立外交关系的各国政府，并已向各国舆论界公布。
