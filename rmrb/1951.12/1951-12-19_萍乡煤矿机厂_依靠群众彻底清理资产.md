    Relying on the Masses to Thoroughly Clear Assets

    The Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Plant, in its work of clearing assets and verifying capital, fully conducted ideological education and relied on the masses to carry out inventory. It successfully completed the asset clearing work despite extremely chaotic management systems.

    Past Production System Was Extremely Chaotic

    The plant's production management system was originally extremely chaotic. Some machines in the plant were idle, neither returned to the warehouse nor managed by anyone. Various working machine tools and engines were covered in dust. Several large lathes that were not frequently used were rusty. The plant had no machine maintenance system; machines were only repaired when they broke down. Among the fourteen commonly used lathes, only four rarely malfunctioned, and workers were very concerned about burning out the engine or breaking the gears when using them. In June, when the administrative side wanted to implement a machine responsibility system, old technician Chen Shibin said, "If we implement a responsibility system, the machines often have problems, and I can't be responsible." However, no one knew exactly what problems the machines had or what their capabilities were, and it was often the case that "large lathes were used for small jobs." The management system for materials and tools was also extremely unsound. Those using materials took them at will, and the material warehouse manager "issued materials upon seeing a requisition slip." The phenomenon of "only taking and not returning" was common; almost everyone had a "small warehouse," and some individual workers even took tools home. Some unused materials were thrown into the scrap pile. The scrap pile was full of good materials; when someone accidentally found good materials in it and used them, it was called "utilizing waste."

    Conducting Ideological Mobilization to Engage the Masses as Masters

    In mid-July, the machinery plant prepared to carry out asset clearing work. At that time, there were several ideological obstacles among the masses. Some said, "Whether we clear it or not, it's all public materials for public use; we haven't wasted anything." Some said, "Isn't clearing just checking to see who lost something so they can be compensated?" Some said, "The machines are not good and often have problems; there's nothing we can do." In response to these ideological situations, the leadership mobilized the masses to visit other factories. The real-world education gave the masses great enlightenment. Everyone believed, "Other people's factories are even bigger than ours, but they manage them in an orderly manner; we really should rectify ourselves." To further make the masses realize the significance and purpose of clearing assets and verifying capital, leading cadres made multiple mobilization reports to the masses, and at the same time, mobilized the masses to launch study and discussions and carried out publicity and education in various ways. After the masses understood the importance of this work, they actively took action. Everyone said, "Democratic reform has made workers truly masters; clearing assets and verifying capital is about us being masters of our own house." "How can we be masters if we don't know our own possessions?" In early August, the machinery plant established five groups for machines, materials, tools, furniture, and comprehensive verification to carry out inventory work separately.

    Relying on Worker Masses to Analyze and Test Machines

    Thoroughly analyzing and testing the performance and problems of each machine and appraising the machine's capabilities is a major and complex task in asset clearing. To fully utilize the workers' operational experience and to make the workers more familiar with their machines, the foreman and operator of the machine were made the main appraisers, with only two technical cadres from the machine group responsible for technical guidance. At the beginning of the inspection, some workers were afraid that increasing the machine's utilization rate would damage the machine. Fitter Song Runhua said, "If the engine burns out during the test, I can't be responsible." In response to this ideological situation, the leadership immediately made it clear to the workers that the administrative side would be fully responsible if there was any damage. After the workers' concerns were dispelled, they conducted tests one by one, and some even disassembled the machines for inspection. During the inspection, the performance, service life, and problems of each machine were carefully recorded on a card, and the card was hung on the machine. When encountering difficult problems during the inspection, everyone used their brains to come up with solutions. A fifteen-horsepower large lathe could previously only exert five horsepower of its power; this time, after thorough analysis and research by the masses and disassembling inspection, it was found that some parts in the gear box were malfunctioning, and after repair, the potential power was fully utilized. After the machine appraisal work, the technical personnel and workers thoroughly understood the machine's problems, accurately made a maintenance plan, and at the same time accurately grasped the machine's performance, dared to fully exert the machine's capabilities, and eliminated the distress of being afraid that increasing efficiency would damage the machine and therefore not daring to use the machine boldly. Turner Yang Xiangqi said, "Before, the administrative side always said that our machines only exerted half of their capabilities, and we didn't know how to exert it; now that we understand the machine's capabilities, we know what kind of work each machine should do, and we can fully exert the machine's capabilities." With the potential capabilities of the machine fully exerted, production efficiency was greatly improved. The highest record for turning coal car axles was previously seven and a half per shift, but now it can be turned twelve; the average number of cutting drill bits per shift was previously forty-five, but now it averages one hundred and twenty; the highest number of inserting bucket wheel tenon slots in eight hours was previously only one hundred and ten, but now one hundred and twenty-eight can be inserted in six hours; the efficiency of milling bucket wheel shaft tenon slots has increased by two times compared to before; the efficiency of other work such as cutting, turning the outer skin, and turning threads has also increased by two times compared to before. In conjunction with the machine appraisal work, the machine responsibility system was also implemented. The workers were familiar with the performance of their machines, repaired them immediately when they found problems, and wiped them down and oiled them whenever they had time. During shift changes or when someone borrowed the machine, everyone checked each other carefully and explained everything carefully. Everyone said, "After everyone is familiar with their own machine, they must each take responsibility, and the machine will not have problems."

    During the inventory and inspection, employees found machine tools that they could not use and returned them to the warehouse in a timely manner, including two lathes, one gantry planer, one set of jackshafts, and a seventy-five-horsepower gasoline air compressor, which was sent to the factory last year for repair; all the mines urgently needed air compressors, but this machine had been stored in the machinery plant for more than a year without anyone paying attention to it.

    Relying on Worker Masses to Inventory Materials and Tools

    The inventory of materials and tools in the machinery plant was also an arduous task. However, thanks to the high sense of responsibility of the employees as masters, the inventory work also achieved great results. The material group was composed of all employees responsible for material management, as well as veteran technicians, model workers, and activists from various workshops. The working principle of the material group was "count the materials as they are seen, and count everything," regardless of whether they were in or out of the warehouse, or whether they were on or off the books, carefully inventorying and carefully identifying them. Through the active efforts of the masses, the inventory not only eliminated the phenomenon of "discrepancies between accounts and materials" but also solved some problems that had always been difficult and had not been dealt with. For example, the material warehouse had more than one thousand sets of ball bearings. Previously, because there was no way to determine the new and old components, old ball bearings were often taken and installed on high-speed engines. The engine would break down as soon as it was started, greatly hindering production. This time, they wiped each set of ball bearings with oil, rotated them for alignment, and carefully inspected them, identifying the specifications and components of the ball bearings. All the material warehouse managers of the Pingxiang Coal Mine learned this method of precision inspection and identification, and they identified more than ten thousand sets of ball bearings. Previously, the iron, low-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, and high-speed steel in the material warehouse were all mixed up, and workers often used steel as iron. This time, the veteran technicians distinguished them one by one based on the sparks rubbed on the grinding wheel. Everyone was very serious and careful about the inventory and identification of waste materials, and a large number of good materials were cleared from the waste materials. More than three thousand kilograms of five different specifications of steel were cleared from the waste materials, and more than two hundred and eighty kilograms of precious alloys, steel, lead, and other materials urgently needed by the mine were cleared. After the material inventory, the material requisition and return system was improved in a timely manner, overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of "random material requisition" and "issuing materials upon seeing a requisition slip" that had existed before.

    In early September, the asset clearing work of the machinery plant was successfully completed. The staff and technicians of the plant were all moved and said, "To do a good job in asset clearing, we can only rely on the masses!" (Central South Industrial Department Communications Group)

    依靠群众彻底清理资产
    萍乡煤矿机厂在清理资产核定资金工作中，充分进行思想教育，依靠群众进行清点，在管理制度极其混乱的情况下，胜利地完成了清理资产工作。
    过去生产制度十分混乱
    这个厂的生产管理制度原来十分混乱。厂里有些机器被闲置着，既不退库，也没人管理。各种工作母机和发动机上满布尘垢。几台不常用的大车床都上了锈。厂里没有机器维护制度，机器不坏就不修。常用的十四台车床中只有四台不常发生故障，工友们在使用时，又怕烧坏发动机，又怕打坏牙轮，顾虑很大。六月份行政方面要实行机器专责制，老技工陈诗斌就说：“要实行专责制，机器常出毛病，我负责不了。”而机器究竟有些什么毛病，能力究竟有多大，大家也都搞不清楚，经常是“大车床做小活”。材料、工具的管理制度也极不健全。用料的人随意领取，材料库管理人“见单发料”。“只领不退”的现象普遍存在，差不多每个人都有“小仓库”，甚至还有个别工人领了工具，存在自己家里。有些没有用完的材料，就被抛到废料堆里去了。废料堆里堆藏着大批好料；有人偶然在其中发现好料拿来用上了时，就叫做“利用废物”。
    进行思想动员发动群众当家
    七月中旬，机厂准备进行清理资产工作。当时在群众中有几种思想障碍。有人说：“清点不清点，反正是公料公用，我们又没有浪费。”有的说：“清点还不是查一下，看谁遗失了东西，好叫赔偿。”有的说：“机器不好，常出毛病，我们也没有办法。”领导方面针对着这些思想情况，发动群众去参观别的工厂。现实的教育，给群众很大的启示。大家认为：“人家的工厂比我们的还要大，搞得有条有理，我们确实应该整顿一下。”为了进一步使群众认识清理资产核定资金的意义和目的，领导干部多次向群众作启发动员报告，同时发动群众展开学习讨论，并用各种方式进行宣传教育。群众明白了这个工作的重要意义后，就积极地行动起来。大家说： “民主改革让工人真正作了主，清理资产核定资金是要我们来当家了。”“不清楚自己的家当，还算什么主人。”八月初，机厂成立了机器、材料、工具、家具、综核等五个小组，分别进行清点工作。
    依靠工人群众分析检验机器
    彻底分析检验每台机器的性能和毛病，鉴定机器的能力，是清理资产中一项主要的而且复杂细致的工作。为了充分利用工人的操作经验，为了使工人更熟悉自己的机器，鉴定机器时就让这台机器的领工、操作人等做主要鉴定者，机器小组仅有两位技术干部负责技术指导。开始检验的时候，有些工人还怕提高了机器的利用率会损坏机器，钳工宋润华就说：“作试验要烧坏了发动机，我可不负责。”领导方面针对这种思想情况，立即向工友们讲清楚：如果有损坏，由行政方面完全负责。工人的顾虑被打消了以后，就逐台进行试验，有的还作了解体检验。在检验中，把每台机器的性能、使用年限和问题，都用卡片仔细登记下来，把卡片挂在机器上。检验中遇到了困难问题，大家开动脑筋，想办法。一台十五马力的大车床，以前最高只能发挥五马力的效力；这一次经过了群众彻底分析研究，作了解体检验，发现牙轮箱内部分配件失灵，修理后潜在的能力就得以充分发挥。机器鉴定工作后，技术人员和工人彻底弄清了机器的毛病，准确地作出了检修计划，同时正确地掌握了机器性能，敢于充分发挥机器能力，消除了怕提高效率会损坏机器，因而不敢大胆使用机器的苦闷。车工杨祥起说：“以前行政方面老说我们的机器只发挥了一半能力，我们也不知道如何发挥法；现在搞清楚了机器的能力，就知道什么机器应该做什么样的活，就可以充分发挥机器能力了。”机器的潜在能力发挥了，生产效率随之大大提高。以前车煤车轴最高的纪录是每班车七根半，现在可车十二根；以前切风钻头平均每班切四十五个，现在平均每班切一百二十个；以前插吊斗轮梢子槽八小时最高只能插一百一十个，现在六小时就可插一百二十八个；铣吊斗轮轴梢子槽的效率比以前提高了两倍；其他像切削、车外皮、车丝扣等工作效率都比以前提高了两倍。结合着机器鉴定工作，还贯彻执行了机器专责制。工人们熟悉了自己的机器的性能，发现毛病就立刻修理，有空就擦洗上油。在交接班或别人借用时，大家都要互相检查，仔细交代。大家说：“各人熟悉了自己的机器后，就要各负各的责，机器就不会出毛病了。”
    清点检验中，职工发现自己可以不用的工作母机，都及时地退到仓库里，计车床两台、龙门刨床
    一台、天轴一套，还有一台七十五匹马力汽油压风机，是去年送到这个厂来修理的；各矿场都迫切需要压风机，而这台机器却存放在机厂一年多没人过问。
    依靠工人群众清点材料工具
    机厂材料和工具的清点也是一件繁重的任务。但是，由于职工群众发挥了主人翁的高度的责任感，清点工作也做出了很大的成绩。材料小组是由负责材料管理的全体职工，以及各车间的老技工、劳动模范、积极分子等组成的。材料小组的工作方针是“见料就点，有一算一”，不分库内库外，不分账内账外，仔细清点，仔细鉴别。经过群众的积极努力，在清点中不仅消灭了“账料不符”的现象，而且解决了一些向来感到困难而终于没有处理的问题。像料库里存着一千多套滚珠，以前因为没法弄清新旧成份，经常把旧滚珠领去装上了高速度发动机。发动机一开动就坏了，妨碍生产很大。这次，他们每套滚珠用油漫擦，旋转校对，仔细检验，把滚珠的规范和成份都鉴别清楚。萍乡煤矿所有的料库管理人都学习了这种精密检验鉴定的办法。鉴别清楚了一万多套滚珠。以前料库中的铁、低炭钢、中炭钢和高速钢都混杂不清，工人经常把钢当作铁来用。这次老技工们根据砂轮上擦出的火花，逐一区别清楚。大家对废料的清点鉴别十分认真仔细，从废料中清出了大批好料。从废料中清出的五种不同规范的钢铁就有三千多公斤，矿山急需用的贵重合金、钢、铅等有二百八十多公斤。材料清点后，及时地健全了领料退料制度，克服了以前“随意领料”与“见单就发”的混乱现象。
    九月上旬，机厂清理资产工作胜利完成。厂里的职员和技术人员都很感动地说：“要搞好清理资产工作，只有依靠群众！”（中南工业部通讯组）
