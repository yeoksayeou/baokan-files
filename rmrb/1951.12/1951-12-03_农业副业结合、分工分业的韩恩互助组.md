    The Han En Mutual Aid Team: Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations, with Division of Labor and Specialization
    Bai Cun, Luo Yingmin, Ren Xuesong
    The Han En Mutual Aid Team in Baotun Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, is a mutual aid team with the characteristics of an agricultural production cooperative.
    Before the land reform in 1947, Baotun Village was a very poor village. All twenty-one households in the village were poor peasants. The majority of the land they cultivated belonged to landlords from other villages. After the land reform, they were allocated land and some means of production, and the entire village was organized into a mutual aid team. After several years of economic development, all twenty-one poor peasant households in the village have risen to the level of middle peasants, and fifteen of them have even reached the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants. The three refugee families who moved in last year can also rise to the level of middle peasants by the end of this year. Currently, the village has a total of twenty-four households with one hundred and four people.
    The Han En Mutual Aid Team now has thirty-two male and female laborers, cultivating fifty-seven hectares of land (each hectare equals fifteen Chinese mu). It has twenty-four horses, thirty-seven cattle (including those raised as sideline production), nine rubber-wheeled carts, four iron-wheeled carts, a set of Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements, and a cultivator. Han En serves as the leader of the mutual aid team. The entire team is divided into four groups according to the nature of the operations: old farm implements, new farm implements, paddy fields, and sideline occupations. Each group has two group leaders, whose work is fixed; group members are assigned according to their individual strengths, but the team leader can flexibly adjust assignments according to work needs.
    The Han En Mutual Aid Team has developed from a low-level, simple agricultural production small mutual aid team into a relatively advanced mutual aid team combining agriculture and sideline occupations, with division of labor and specialization. It has accumulated some public property (new farm implements and sideline funds are all publicly owned by the team), and some land has broken boundaries, jointly cultivated with new farm implements.
    The Han En Mutual Aid Team has the following characteristics:
        I. Rational use of labor – from small-
    scale mutual plowing to division of labor and specialization.
    The development process of the Han En Mutual Aid Team can be roughly divided into three stages: the first stage was from 1947 to the summer of 1948, when the organizational form was only small-scale mutual plowing; the second stage was from the summer of 1948 to the end of 1949, when the small-scale mutual plowing was changed to "fixed groups with flexible adjustments," that is, a mutual aid form with unified allocation of labor; the third stage was from 1950 to 1951, when new farm implements were used, and agriculture and sideline occupations had a relatively complete division of labor.
    (1) Rational reorganization of labor organization, so that all the village's labor force is mutually adjusted under unified leadership, improving labor efficiency. When the village was first organized in 1947, there were four small-scale mutual plowing groups. Except for three households, all the farmers in the village participated in the groups. The organization at this time had two main shortcomings: first, the division of labor was rigid, with each group as a unit, without contact with each other, taking turns to cultivate the land, finishing this piece and then planting that piece, wasting both people and work; second, violating the principle of mutual benefit, livestock and labor were not distinguished by strength, and work points were calculated equally, and farm implements and carts were used without compensation. Despite these shortcomings, the superiority of the mutual aid team was demonstrated in the first year of organization. Not only was all the cultivated land planted in a timely manner, but also five hectares of wasteland were opened up. Due to more manure and timely cultivation, more grain was harvested. The three individual farmers saw the benefits of the mutual aid team and also joined the mutual aid team in winter. In the summer of 1948, in order to overcome the above shortcomings, it was changed to a large group leading small groups, that is, a "fixed group with flexible adjustments" (labor was carried out on the basis of small groups, and the labor force was adjusted by the large group when necessary) mutual aid form. The evaluation and recording of work was conscientiously implemented, and human and animal power were scored according to strength; work points were divided according to the work of the day, and accounts were settled once after a production stage, and a convention for the use of farm implements was established. The benefit of this form is that manpower can be flexibly allocated, avoiding waste. When planting, each group generally has three sets of plows, and people and livestock move with the plows. When cultivating, the group meeting negotiates and determines the order, calculates the required work points, and the large group leader uniformly allocates, overcoming the phenomenon that the labor force frequently moves with the land, thus often delaying work; it also avoids the phenomenon of wasteland due to untimely cultivation. The result of rational use of labor is that labor efficiency is greatly improved. In the past, it took thirty-eight work points per hectare of land from planting to harvesting, but at this time, twenty-nine work points were enough. Because livestock and carts are all evaluated according to strength and quality, farmers are more willing to add livestock and carts, so the entire village bought four carts in 1948.
    (2) The use of new farm implements promotes the division of labor and specialization, thus creating a surplus labor force. In 1950, after the group used Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements, agricultural division of labor began. It was divided into three groups: new farm implements, old farm implements (some mountain slopes cannot use new farm implements), and paddy fields. In 1951, a sideline occupation group was added. In order to facilitate the use of new farm implements, the land of seven households has broken boundaries. The benefits of using new farm implements are, first, labor-saving. This year, from spring plowing to summer cultivation, each hectare of land saved 10.75 work points. The second is that it can adjust leisure and busy periods. Using old farm implements, plowing and sowing must be carried out at the same time. The plow cannot be lowered until the time comes, so the work is crowded together, and it is too busy. Using new farm implements, the land is plowed quickly, and human and animal power are appropriately adjusted, and the busy farming season is shortened. This year, spring plowing was shortened by three days compared to 1949, and summer cultivation was shortened by ten days. Third, after using new farm implements, the land can be deeply cultivated by 1.5 to 2 inches, and the harrow is broken, and rainwater is easy to penetrate into the soil. Crops take root deeply and can resist drought and wind. Since the use of new farm implements, the average yield per hectare of land can be increased by about 480 catties of grain. Moreover, there is a surplus of labor, and some labor can be extracted during the busy farming season to carry out sideline production outside. In 1950, eight people, twelve horses, and four rubber-wheeled carts were drawn out to haul goods during cultivation.
    (3) The implementation of division of labor and specialization has greatly improved agricultural technology. The group carries out fixed division of labor according to the strengths of the group members, so that everyone can specialize in one kind of farming technology. This year, specialized personnel use new farm implements, and the operation is skilled. During spring plowing, each hectare of land saves two man-days and four animal-days compared to the same period last year. During summer cultivation, the new farm implement group not only overcame the problem of inaccurate row spacing last year, but also improved efficiency. One person and one horse can cultivate one hectare a day, which is two mu more than last year, and saves one man-day. Because the paddy field group has specialized technical guidance, all of them adopted advanced transplanting methods (in the past, seeds were scattered), and used new weeding machines to weed, so the seedlings were more robust than in previous years.
    Due to the rational reorganization of the labor organization, the use of new farm implements, and the implementation of division of labor and specialization, the planning of production has been improved, changing the passive situation of "people following the work" and achieving "people controlling the work," while improving labor efficiency. This year, in addition to extracting some labor to engage in sideline occupations, the group also extracted more manpower and animal power to plant cash crops and reclaim wasteland. This year, the area of soybeans and other special products in the whole group has reached more than 80% of the cultivated land area, an increase of 21% over last year. The cultivated land area of the whole group has expanded from 38 hectares in 1947 to 57 hectares, an increase of 19 hectares. The number of cultivations has also increased year by year. In 1947, it was generally two cultivations and three weedings. In 1950, most of the cultivated land was cultivated three times and weeded four times, and some were cultivated five times and weeded five times. The area of fertilizer application has also expanded significantly, from 66% in 1947 to 90.5% in 1950. The amount of fertilizer applied per hectare of land has also increased from 20 carts in 1947 to 55 carts in 1950. Due to the above reasons, agricultural output has increased year by year. In 1947, the average yield per hectare of land was 3,120 catties of raw grain; in 1948, it increased to 3,484 catties; in 1949, despite the drought, it still increased to 4,320 catties; and in 1950, it increased to 5,520 catties.
    II. The constant combination of agriculture and sideline occupations enables
    farmers' incomes to increase substantially, laying the
    foundation for expanded reproduction.
    After the group rationally used manpower and implemented division of labor and specialization, in addition to improving labor efficiency and improving farming techniques, it also freed up surplus labor and carried out year-round sideline production. After the organization in 1947, the entire village, young and old, was organized to engage in sideline production such as making shoes, weaving mats, and making tobacco rope grass. In winter, the entire village pooled shares to open a flour mill, which was also used for pig raising. After 1948, on this basis, it was organized to engage in transportation and sales. In 1949, the cooperative form of "inserting carts and hanging horses" was adopted, and several families inserted a cart to haul goods, and dividends were distributed according to shares; later, it was further changed to the large-scale sideline occupations of the entire village (flour mill, transportation, and the livestock cooperative established this year), which were uniformly operated. In 1948, sideline production earned more than 17 million yuan; in 1949, it earned 30 million yuan; in 1950, it was able to frequently haul goods during the busy farming season, earning 26 million yuan in half a year; this year, it earned more than 10 million yuan in hauling goods in preparation for spring plowing, and it is estimated to earn 120 million yuan by the autumn harvest, which is more than four times that of last year. Due to the substantial increase in income, the number of carts and horses in the whole group has also increased year by year. This year, four rubber-wheeled carts and seven horses were added. After the increase in carts and horses, the labor time for agricultural work such as sending manure and harvesting was greatly shortened. In preparation for spring plowing, the manure of the entire village can be sent to the fields in three or four days.
    The sideline production of the group is carried out under the unified leadership of the sideline group leader. When engaging in sideline occupations during the busy farming season, the large group leader calls a meeting of the group leaders to discuss and make a production plan for agriculture and sideline occupations, and uniformly allocate labor. The principle is that in addition to ensuring the carts and manpower for completing agricultural production, the remaining labor is extracted to haul goods. During the slack farming season, the sideline group leader makes unified plans, and the principle is to ensure that everyone has work to do and can increase income. The funds for operating sideline occupations are invested by each household in the whole group according to the population (one share per person), and the sideline funds are used as the public property of the group, and a property management committee is set up to uniformly plan and control them. The group now has 120 million yuan in public funds.
    The group also pays attention to mastering the principle of equivalent value and mutual benefit in operating sideline occupations. The land of the sideline group members is cultivated by the agricultural group, and wages are paid according to work points
    (paid by the people participating in sideline occupations). The profits obtained from sideline income, after deducting wage costs, are distributed according to capital and labor. Sideline funds are limited to one share per person (unmarried single men can invest one to three shares), and a portion of the profits from operating sideline occupations is divided equally according to shares. In this way, it avoids the phenomenon of having more capital and less labor, or being unwilling to work and simply using capital to reap profits. It enables these people to concentrate their surplus money, add carts and buy horses, and invest in agricultural and sideline production, so as not to use capital to exploit the labor of others and form unequal exchange. The method of distributing dividends according to labor is to distribute them in proportion to the labor and the wages for substitute cultivation between those who participate in sideline occupations and those who cultivate the land for the sideline group. In addition to hauling goods, operating flour mills, and livestock cooperatives, which are large-scale sideline occupations for the entire village, the group's male and female laborers also engage in other sideline occupations such as weaving mats, weaving grass bags, and cutting Ula grass, all of which are carried out in a free combination of labor, and there are methods for evaluating work points and equivalent value. Because sideline production is carried out under leadership and planning, and the principle of equivalent value and mutual benefit is mastered, and it is closely combined with agricultural production, the mutual aid team is becoming more and more consolidated.
        III. A production model, also a patriotic
    model, the Han En Mutual Aid Team is steadily advancing along the New Democratic path.
    The Han En Mutual Aid Team has not only achieved great results in organizing and developing production, but also actively responds to the call of the motherland and advances along the New Democratic path.
    (1) Actively respond to the call of the state. During the People's Liberation War in 1947, the People's Government mobilized young and middle-aged people to join the People's Liberation Army, and seven young people from the group voluntarily signed up to join the army. The farmers who did not join the army voluntarily organized stretcher teams and participated in war service work. In the Battle of Siping, the group also produced a war service model. Last year, when the war of aggression against Korea by US imperialism threatened the border of the motherland, Han En was the first to request to carry a stretcher to Korea, and wanted to send his son to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Chi Dianwen, the leader of the sideline group, and Zhang Jichen, a member of the group, sold their cattle and exchanged them for strong horses, preparing to participate in war service work. The whole group put forward the slogan "Feed the horses fat, prepare the carts well, and go whenever the motherland needs us." Last autumn, the group put canopies on the carts and formed a war service team, waiting for the call of the motherland. In September 1950, Han En participated in the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and accepted the advanced experience of industrial labor models using challenge competitions to improve production; in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, under the leadership of the Jiaohe County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Han En Mutual Aid Team launched a challenge competition to increase production and strengthen the strength to resist US aggression and aid Korea to farmers in Northeast China, promoting the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in rural areas of Northeast China. In March of this year, the group actively responded to the call of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to launch a patriotic bumper harvest movement, and launched a patriotic bumper harvest competition challenge to the mutual aid teams in Northeast China, and challenged Li Shunda. After the General Association for Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea issued three major appeals in June, the Han En Mutual Aid Team was the first to respond enthusiastically. The group donated a total of 5.07 million yuan to purchase airplanes and cannons, and guaranteed that the land of the families of revolutionary soldiers would be cultivated three times and weeded three times, and every household established a patriotic pact. Although they suffered a severe flood in late August and the crops were damaged, everyone's enthusiasm for production did not decrease. The whole group put forward the slogan of "self-reliance through production." Not only did they pay off the donation amount four months ahead of schedule at the end of August, but they also set out a plan to actively engage in sideline occupations to make up for the losses caused by the flood and increase the donation by 4 million yuan.
    (2) Strengthen ideological education and establish the correct view of getting rich through organized labor. When the Han En Mutual Aid Team was not organized, because the People's Liberation War had not yet ended, some farmers who had just turned over were afraid of "changing the sky," and their labor was not vigorous enough, and they had the idea of being content with poverty; some farmers who had livestock or strong labor were afraid of suffering losses if they helped each other. These wrong ideas hindered them from actively participating in the mutual aid team. At this time, Han En, Chi Dianwen and other village cadres persuaded them one by one, explaining to everyone the production policy and the principle of getting rich through organized labor, especially emphasizing the idea of "being content with poverty," and emphasizing the voluntary and mutually beneficial organizational principle, and the mutual aid team was organized. After the lives of the farmers in the entire village universally improved in 1949, the general farmers developed the idea of exploitation. In the spring of 1950, the group engaged in the matter of buying three dan of soybeans from other villages in the way of "approving green" (that is, buying green seedlings at a low price, harvesting grain in autumn and selling it, and reaping huge profits). After Han En returned from studying at the Jiaohe County Committee of the Communist Party of China during the autumn harvest, he realized that this was a form of usury exploitation, and immediately convened a meeting of all party members in the village to discuss the issue, and after everyone realized this problem, he convened a meeting of all group members to discuss the "approving green" issue. Group member Zhang Jichen told everyone at the meeting about the fact that he had suffered a lifetime of suffering from the landlord because of "approving green," which gave everyone a great education. Han En, Chi Dianwen and others further explained to everyone that only by following the Communist Party and taking the road of getting rich through organized labor would there be a future. After everyone understood, they decided to still pay the household that requested "approving green" the price of the three dan of soybeans according to the market price at the time of the autumn harvest. Although some group members still had such ideas afterwards, after continuous persuasion and education, no usury has occurred in the entire village until now.
    (3) Preparing to move towards a more advanced organizational form – an agricultural production cooperative, adapting to the needs of economic development, and finding a proper outlet for the group's public funds, the Han En Mutual Aid Team established a livestock cooperative this year, and everyone raised funds to buy cattle and collectively raise them. The whole group has also made a construction plan, preparing to transform all the houses in the village into brick and tile houses in three to five years (the original houses were all thatched houses), and preparing to build public farm implement warehouses (new farm implements), school buildings, public livestock pens, bathhouses, etc. In order to realize this plan, it was decided to open a brick kiln next spring, produce bricks in May, and start construction after autumn. The group is also preparing to turn the wasteland around the village into fertile land, and plans to reclaim ten hectares of wasteland in the near future.
    Now Han En, Chi Dianwen and other leading backbones of the mutual aid team and some activists are preparing to further improve the mutual aid team to the organizational form of a production cooperative. They believe that according to the actual situation of the group, it has the main conditions for moving towards a production cooperative: 1. The whole group has implemented the division of labor and specialization; 2. There are a large amount of public funds and public property; 3. New farm implements are used for cultivation; some cultivated land has broken boundaries; 4. There are strong leading backbones such as Han En and Chi Dianwen; 5. The masses have many years of mutual aid experience and mutual aid habits; and have a strong desire to develop production. Therefore, as long as all the group members are ideologically mature, an agricultural production cooperative with land shares can be realized.
    Because the Han En Mutual Aid Team correctly implemented Chairman Mao's instruction of "organizing and developing production" and made outstanding achievements, it was selected as the special model mutual aid team in Jilin Province for two consecutive years in 1949 and 1950. At the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers in 1950, the group won the collective award with the handwritten inscription of "Model on the Production Front" by Chairman Mao.
    The achievements of the Han En Mutual Aid Team are inseparable from the correct leadership of Han En and Chi Dianwen and other four village cadres. Han En is a member of the Communist Party of China. Under the training and education of the Party, he has gradually been tempered into an outstanding peasant organizer. He educates farmers with his own model labor behavior, promotes democracy in the group, solves problems in a timely manner, and all work has a thorough and appropriate plan, so he has achieved great results. Since 1947, Han En has been elected as a special labor model in the district and county, and in 1950, he was elected as a member of the Jilin Provincial People's Government and a representative to the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

    After hearing the three major appeals of the China People's General Association for Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Han En Mutual Aid Team immediately convened a meeting to revise the patriotic pact. Han En donated 1 million yuan on the spot to purchase weapons for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    The Han En Mutual Aid Team guarantees to cultivate and weed for military families first, completing four cultivations and four weedings. This is Han En expressing his willingness to do a good job in substitute cultivation to military families.

    农业副业结合、分工分业的韩恩互助组
    白村  罗颖民  任雪松
    吉林省蛟河县保安屯韩恩互助组，是一个带有农业生产合作社性质的互助组。
    保安屯在一九四七年土地改革以前，是一个很穷的屯子。全屯二十一户，都是贫农。他们耕种的土地，极大部分是外屯地主的。土地改革以后，他们分得了土地和一些生产工具，全屯组织成一个互助组。经过几年来经济的发展，全屯二十一户贫农，均已上升为中农，其中十五户且已达到富裕中农的生活水平。去年迁来的三户难民，到今年年底也可上升为中农。现全屯共二十四户，一百零四人。
    韩恩互助组现在共有三十二个男女劳动力，耕种五十七垧地（每垧等于十五市亩）。有马二十四匹，牛三十七头（作为副业生产的饲养牛在内），胶皮轮大车九辆，铁轮大车四辆，苏联式马拉农具一套，铲趟机一台。互助组组长由韩恩担任。全组按操作性质分为旧农具、新农具、水田、副业等四个小组。每一小组有两名小组长，小组长的工作是固定的；组员按个人特长分组，但又可以按工作需要由组长统一灵活调动。
    韩恩互助组是一个由低级的、单纯农业生产的小型互助组，发展成农业和副业结合的、分工分业的、较高级的互助组，积累了一些公共财产（新式农具、副业资金都是全组公有），有些土地已打破地界，共同以新式农具耕种。
    韩恩互助组有以下几个特点：
        一、合理使用劳力，——从小
    型插犋换工到分工分业。
    韩恩互助组的发展过程大体可分为三个阶段：一九四七年到一九四八年夏为第一阶段，这时的组织形式只是小型的插犋换工；一九四八年夏到一九四九年底为第二阶段，由小型插犋改成“死组活编”即统一调剂劳力的互助形式；一九五○年到一九五一年为第三阶段，这时使用了新式农具，农业和副业有了比较完备的专业分工。
    （一）合理整编劳动组织，使全屯劳力在统一领导之下互相调剂，提高了劳动效率。该屯一九四七年最初组织起来时，共有四个小型的插犋换工组，除三户外，全屯农户都参加了组。这时的组织有两个主要缺点：一是分工死板，以一个小组为单位，互不联系，轮流种地，种完这块种那块，人与活都有些耽误；二是违反两利原则，牲口、人工不分强弱，平均计工，农具大车无代价使用。虽有这些缺点，但在组织起来的第一年，就显示出互助组的优越性，不但适时地种上了全部熟地，还开了五垧熟荒。由于上粪多，铲趟及时，多打了粮食。三户单干农民看到了互助组的好处，在冬天也参加了互助组。一九四八年夏，为克服以上缺点，改为大组领导小组，即“死组活编”（以小组为基础进行劳动，必要时由大组调剂劳动力）的互助形式。认真实行了评工记账，人畜力均按强弱评分；每天按活计分，一个生产阶段结束后即结账一次，并订了使用农具公约。这种形式的好处，在于人力可以灵活调用，避免浪费。种地时每组一般有三付犁杖，人、畜随犁转移。铲地时由小组会协商，确定次序，计算出所需工数，由大组长统一调配，克服了劳力经常随地块移动，因而经常误工的现象；也避免了因铲趟不及时发生荒芜田地的现象。合理使用劳力的结果，使劳动效率大大提高。过去一垧地从种到收需要三十八个工，这时有二十九个工就够了。因牲口大车都按强弱好坏评工，农民就更愿意添置牲口大车，因此一九四八年全屯即买进大车四辆。
    （二）使用新式农具，促进分工分业，因而有了剩余劳力。一九五○年，该组使用苏联式马拉农具后，开始了农业分工。共分为新式农具、旧农具（有些山坡地不能使用新式农具）、水田三个组。一九五一年又增加了一个副业组。为了便于使用新式农具，有七户的地已打破地界。使用新式农具的好处，第一是省工。今年从春耕到夏锄，每垧地节省了十点七五工。第二是可以调剂闲忙。使用旧农具，连翻地带下种，得同时进行，不到时候不能下犁，因此活挤在一起，忙不过来。使用新式农具，地翻耕得快，人畜力得到适当的调剂，并缩短了农忙时间。这一年春耕比一九四九年缩短了三天，夏锄缩短了十天。第三，使用新式农具后，地能深耕一寸半到二寸，耙的碎，雨水易于渗入土内，农作物扎根深，能抗旱抗风。自使用新式农具后，平均每垧地约可增产四百八十斤粮食。而且有了剩余劳力，农忙时也能抽出部分劳力出外进行副业生产。一九五○年铲地时，抽出八个人，十二匹马，四辆胶轮车出外拉脚。
    （三）实行分工分业，农业技术很快提高了。该组按组员的特长进行固定分工，使每人都能专研一种耕作技术。今年由专人使用新式农具，操作熟练，春耕时每一垧地即比去年同期节省了两个人工和四个畜工，夏锄时新式农具组不但克服了去年趟垅宽窄不准的毛病，而且提高了效率，一人一马一天即可铲趟一垧，比去年多二亩，还省一个人工。水田组因有专人从事技术指导，全部采用了进步的插秧作法（过去是撒种），并使用新式除草机锄草，所以苗比往年茁壮。
    由于合理地整编了劳动组织、使用新式农具和实行了分工分业，提高了生产的计划性，改变了“人随活走”的被动状况，做到了“人支配活”，同时提高了劳动效率。今年该组除抽出一部分劳力去经营副业外，并抽出了更多的人力、畜力去种植经济作物和垦荒。今年全组大豆及其他特产作物面积，已达耕地面积百分之八十以上，较去年增加百分之二十一。全组耕地面积由一九四七年的三十八垧扩大到五十七垧，增加了十九垧。铲趟次数亦逐年增加。一九四七年一般为二铲三趟，一九五○年大部耕地做到三铲四趟，部分作到五铲五趟。施肥面积也显著扩大，一九四七年为百分之六十六，一九五○年增加为百分之九十点五。每垧地的施肥量也由一九四七年的二十车增加到一九五○年的五十五车。由于以上各种原因，农业产量逐年增加。一九四七年平均每垧地打原粮三千一百二十斤；一九四八年增加到三千四百八十四斤；一九四九年虽遭天旱，仍增加到四千零三百二十斤；一九五○年则增加到五千五百二十斤。
    二、农副业常年结合，农民
    收入大量增加，打下了扩大再
    生产的基础。
    该组合理使用人力，实行分工分业后，除提高了劳动效率，改进了耕作技术外，又腾出剩余劳力，进行了常年的副业生产。一九四七年组织起来后，即开始组织全屯男女老少进行做鞋、编席子、打烟绳草等副业生产，到冬天，全屯集股开了一座粉房，附带养猪。一九四八年后，在这一基础之上组织起来，从事运销。一九四九年采用了“插车挂马”的合作形式，好几家插起一台车来拉脚，按股分红；后进一步改成全屯的大宗副业（粉房、运输及今年成立起来的牧畜合作社等），统一经营。一九四八年副业生产共收入人民币一千七百余万元；一九四九年收入三千万元；一九五○年农忙时也能经常出车拉脚，半年中即收入人民币二千六百万元；今年在准备春耕中出车拉脚，收入一千余万元，到秋收时约收入一亿二千万元，等于去年四倍多。由于收入大量增加，全组车马也逐年增加。今年增加了胶皮轮大车四辆，马七匹。车马增加后，大大缩短了送粪、收获等农活的劳动时间。在准备春耕中，三、四天工夫全村的粪都可送到地里。
    该组的副业生产是在副业组长统一领导之下进行的。农忙时搞副业，则通过大组长召集各组组长协商，作出农副业生产计划，统一分配劳力。原则是除保证完成农业生产的车马及人力外，剩余劳力抽出去拉脚。农闲时由副业组组长统一计划，原则是使大家都有活干，都能增加收入。经营副业的资金是由全组各户按人口入股（一人一股），副业资金即作为组里的公共财产，设有财产管理委员会统一计划掌握。现该组已有公共资金一亿二千万元。
    该组在经营副业中，也注意掌握了等价两利的原则。副业组组员的土地由农业组耕种，按工付给工资
    （由参加副业的人付给）。副业收入除去工资成本外，所获利润，按资金和劳力分红。副业资金限定每口人只能入一股（尚未成家的单身汉可入一股至三股），经营副业所得利润的一部分，按股平分。这样，就避免发生资金多而劳力少、或不愿劳动而单纯用资金坐收利润的现象。使这些人能集中余钱，添车买马，投资农副业生产，不致以资金去剥削他人的劳动，形成不等价交换。按劳力分红的办法，是由参加副业的与给副业组耕种土地的，按脚力与代耕工资为比例分配。除拉脚、经营粉房和牧畜合作社等全屯的大宗副业外，组内各男女劳动力从事其他编席、编草袋、割靰鞡草等副业时，也都采取自由组合的变工方式进行，都有评工等价的办法。由于副业生产是有领导有计划地进行，并掌握了等价两利的原则，又和农业生产密切结合，这样就使互助组日趋巩固。
        三、是生产模范，也是爱国
    模范，韩恩互助组遵循着新民
    主主义的道路稳步前进。
    韩恩互助组不仅在组织起来，发展生产上获得巨大成绩，并且能积极响应祖国的号召，遵循着新民主主义的道路向前发展。
    （一）积极响应国家号召。在一九四七年的人民解放战争中，人民政府动员青壮年参加人民解放军，该组即有七个青年自动报名参军。未参军的农民自动组织担架队，参加了战争勤务工作。在参加四平战役中，该组并出现了战勤模范。去年美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争威胁到祖国边疆的时候，韩恩第一个要求抬担架到朝鲜去，并要送儿子参加人民志愿军。副业组组长迟殿文，组员张继臣都把牛卖了，换成壮马，准备参加战勤工作。全组提出了“把马喂肥，车准备好，祖国什么时候需要什么时候到”的口号。去秋该组把车上好了车棚，编了一个战勤队，等待着祖国的召唤。一九五○年九月，韩恩参加全国工农兵劳动模范代表大会，接受了工业劳动模范用挑战竞赛来提高生产的先进经验；在抗美援朝运动中，在中共蛟河县委员会的领导下，韩恩互助组向全东北农民提出增加生产，加强抗美援朝力量的挑战竞赛，推动了东北农村的抗美援朝运动。今年三月，该组又积极响应中央人民政府农业部开展爱国丰产运动的号召，向全东北互助组提出爱国主义丰产竞赛挑战，并向李顺达应战。今年六月抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，韩恩互助组首先热烈响应。该组共捐献购买飞机大炮的款项五百零七万元，保证革命军人家属的地做到三铲三趟，家家户户订立了爱国公约。八月下旬虽遭受严重水灾，庄稼遭受损失，但大家的生产热情并未降低，全组提出“生产自救”的口号，不但提前四个月在八月末缴齐捐献款数，又订出积极搞副业补救水灾损失，并增加捐献四百万元的计划。
    （二）加强思想教育，建立组织起来劳动致富的正确观点。韩恩互助组在未组织起来时，因人民解放战争尚未结束，一部分刚翻身的农民怕“变天”，劳动不够起劲，有安于贫困的思想；部分有牲口或劳动力强的农民，怕互助起来吃亏。这些错误思想，妨碍他们积极参加互助组。这时韩恩、迟殿文等村干部挨家劝说，向大家讲明生产政策和组织起来劳动致富的道理，特别着重批判了“安于贫困”的思想，又强调自愿两利的组织原则，互助组才组织起来。一九四九年全屯农民的生活普遍上升以后，一般农民滋生了剥削思想。一九五○年春天，该组发生了用“批青”（即以低价购买青苗，秋后收粮卖出，坐获厚利）方式向外屯买入三石大豆的事情。秋收时韩恩从中共蛟河县委员会学习回来后，认识了这是一种高利贷剥削方式，即召集全屯党员开会讨论，在大家认识这一问题以后，又召集全组组员开会讨论“批青”问题。组员张继臣在会上向大家诉说了他因“批青”给地主受了一辈子苦的事实，给大家很大教育。韩恩、迟殿文等又向大家进一步说明了只有跟着共产党，走组织起来劳动致富的道路，才有前途。当大家明白过来以后，决定仍按秋收时的市价，把三石大豆的价钱补给要求“批青”户。以后部分组员虽仍发生此类思想，但经过不断地说服教育，全屯直至现在还没有发生过一件放高利贷的事情。
    （三）准备走向更高级的组织形式——农业生产合作社适应着经济发展的要求，并给全组公共资金找到正当出路，韩恩互助组今年已成立了一个牧畜合作社，大家集资买牛，集体喂养。全组并订出了建设计划，准备在三、五年内将全屯房子改造成砖瓦房（原来的房子都是草房），并准备建筑公共的农具仓库（新农具），学校校舍、公共畜圈、澡塘等。为实现这一计划，决定明春开砖窑一座，五月出砖，秋后即可兴工。该组并准备把屯子周围的荒地变成沃土，计划最近一、二年内开荒地十垧。
    现在韩恩、迟殿文等互助组的领导骨干和一部分积极分子，正在准备将互助组进一步提高到生产合作社的组织形式。他们认为就该组的现实情况看来，已具备走向生产合作社的主要条件：1、全组已实行分工分业；2、有了大量的公共资金与公共财产；3、用新式农具耕种；部分耕地已打破地界；4、有韩恩、迟殿文等坚强的领导骨干；5、群众有多年的互助经验和互助习惯；有强烈的发展生产的要求。因此，只要全体组员在思想上酝酿成熟，土地入股的农业生产合作社即可实现。
    韩恩互助组因为正确地执行了毛主席的“组织起来发展生产”的指示，并作出了优异的成绩，一九四九年及一九五○年，两年被连选为吉林省的特等模范互助组。在一九五○年的全国工农兵劳动模范代表会上，该组荣获毛主席亲笔写的“生产战线上的模范”的集体奖状。
    韩恩互助组的成就，是韩恩及迟殿文等四个村干部的正确领导是分不开的。韩恩是中共党员。他在党的培养教育下，逐渐锻炼成为一个出色的农民组织者，他以自己的模范劳动行为教育农民，在组内发扬民主，发现问题及时解决，一切工作都有周密而恰当的计划，因而获得很大成绩。自一九四七年起，韩恩当选为区县特等劳动模范，一九五○年当选为吉林省人民政府委员和出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。（附图片）
    劳动模范韩恩
    这是韩恩互助组的畜力发动机
    韩恩互助组听到中国人民抗美援朝总会的三大号召后，马上召开会议，修订了爱国公约。韩恩当场捐献了一百万元，为中国人民志愿军购买武器。
    韩恩互助组保证给军属先铲先趟，完成四铲四趟。这是韩恩向军属表示做好代耕工作时的情形。
