An Example of Resolving Marital and Mother-in-Law/Daughter-in-Law Disputes Through Self-Criticism
    Miao Jing

Recently, cadres in Shahe County, Hebei Province, have been studying the Marriage Law. Some comrades have examined their feudal thoughts and practices based on the document. The following is a record of a typical report given by Kang Qinghe, a cadre from the Trust Company, at a meeting.

    My home is in Dukou Village, Shahe County. I only went to elementary school and then just did business. I had a wife before. Our relationship wasn't bad, but my mother's feudal patriarchal ideas were too strong. She often scolded her for no reason. Sometimes my wife argued back, and my mother would tell me to hit her. I was afraid people would say I was "unfilial," so I actually hit her. Later, my mother also hit her herself. She couldn't take it anymore and finally ran away with one of the children. At the time, I felt very sad and regretful. But my regret wasn't because I understood the principle of gender equality, but because I was worried that my family was poor and I wouldn't be able to find another wife.

    Not long after liberation, I joined the revolutionary work. Through a matchmaker and with the agreement of both parties, I married Chunfeng. Chunfeng lost her mother when she was young, works exceptionally hard, and is also the leader of the spinning group, with very progressive ideas. My family was allocated a house and land during the land reform, and our life improved. My mother's temper also improved a bit. They got along well for about half a year, then my mother's old habits returned. She started muttering and scolding Chunfeng. At first, Chunfeng was embarrassed to argue back; later, my mother became increasingly fierce. Chunfeng got angry and simply refused to tolerate it anymore. They started arguing.

    Because I had received revolutionary education, I couldn't stand it and constantly tried to persuade my mother. I said, "Mom, you're getting old. You should take a break from family affairs. Since we got the house and land, things have been much better than before. Chunfeng may not have a good temper, but she is thrifty and knows how to manage the household." Because I kept persuading her, my mother listened a little, but sometimes she would pout and say, "You always blame me for meddling, but a woman is always going to meetings, which is supposed to be for work. Look how stubborn she is! She dares to argue with her mother-in-law. When I was a daughter-in-law, who dared to talk back to their mother-in-law!"

    In the evening, I also persuaded Chunfeng. I mainly said, "No matter how Mom argues, just don't argue back with her." Chunfeng said, "I haven't argued back before, but I haven't been scolded any less. She scolds me for the slightest disagreement, will it ever end!"

    Once, when I was persuading Chunfeng, she argued back with me. I got angry and said, "No matter if she scolds you or not, you are not allowed to argue back!" She said, "I haven't done anything wrong, she can't scold me!" I said, "I won't allow you to argue back!" She said, "You won't allow it? Do whatever you want!" I got angry and, before she finished speaking, I punched her twice. She didn't make a sound, picked up a broom, and hit me hard twice. I jumped up without putting on my clothes and started fighting with her. Later, the neighbors heard us fighting and came, and we stopped.

    Chunfeng opened the door, picked up the child, and walked out. I was really worried, afraid she would run away too. Fortunately, the director of the Democratic Women's Federation came and stopped her. But she refused to come back no matter what. Finally, she was persuaded to go to the home of the Women's Federation director, and I was relieved.

    Chunfeng insisted on divorcing me. The director of the Women's Federation persuaded her all night. Finally, she proposed: either divorce, or we had to separate from my mother. I hesitated and didn't answer her, thinking she might get better after a couple of days. Who knew that she wouldn't come back if we didn't separate. After three or four days, I really had no choice but to persuade my mother to separate. At first, my mother didn't agree. She said, "I raised you, and now you want to separate from me! If we separate, then we separate. The house and land are mine, you can go wherever you want!" I repeatedly persuaded my mother: "She's so stubborn, the two of you really can't stay together. It's better to separate, and you'll have less trouble. Even if we separate, I can't not take care of you!"

    The family was finally separated. My mother chose three good rooms and was given two more acres of good land. From then on, Chunfeng felt more at ease. During the day, she still worked in the fields, and at night, she led women in spinning, and she was even more active than before.

    I returned to the office and didn't dare to mention anything about the family. But the higher-ups eventually found out that I had beaten my wife and criticized me. I also humbly admitted my mistake and realized that it was wrong to hit people and that I still had feudal ideas of "male superiority." I was determined to change.

    From then on, I thought my thinking had truly changed. But I still felt that my wife should serve me. Who knew that not examining and criticizing this point would cause trouble again.

    Once, I went to the countryside to purchase cotton and passed by my house. That day, Chunfeng was worried because she had asked someone to pull two carts of vegetables, didn't have money to buy oil, and couldn't feed them. When she saw me come in, she was in a bad mood, complaining that I didn't bring money home and gave all the money to my mother. We couldn't help but exchange a few words. I asked her to pour water, and she said, "Don't you have hands?" I got a little angry, but I didn't want to provoke her. I wanted to leave, so I asked her for clothes. She said, "You didn't buy cotton or cloth, I haven't made any clothes for you." It was so cold, and she hadn't made me cotton clothes, and she wouldn't even pour me water. I got so angry that I kicked the broken clay pot under the table. The bean seeds in the pot were scattered all over the floor. She got angry too and picked up the teapot on the table to throw it. I said, "You're rebelling!" and went up and snatched it away.

    The two of us couldn't resolve it, so we went to the district government and found Secretary Hou. Secretary Hou spent a lot of effort to persuade Chunfeng to go back. Then he came to persuade me, saying, "Old Kang, think about it carefully, what's wrong with Chunfeng? You're just practicing 'male chauvinism,' aren't you? The Marriage Law has been promulgated for several months, and you haven't studied it properly. Chunfeng poured out her grievances to me for a long time. You say you're busy with work, but she's no less busy at home. She's farming, spinning, cooking, and taking care of the children all day long, and she doesn't even have a moment to spare. And you still complain that she doesn't serve you well enough. Think about it, is that right? We're promoting the Marriage Law now, if we don't lead by example, how can we lead the masses? How can we promote it to others?" Then, Secretary Hou explained the spirit of the Marriage Law to me in detail, such as gender equality and freedom of marriage, and gave many examples to educate me. This made me feel deeply ashamed.

    When I got home, Chunfeng had just gone to sleep. I admitted my mistake to her. Chunfeng was embarrassed, she said happily, "The past is over, let's just live well from now on." Before she could say another word, she got up and went to make me dinner. I also went to help her, and we were both extremely happy. After dinner, we lay on the bed and talked until late at night, even more intimately than when we were newlyweds. I returned to the office, reported on my work, and talked about my family affairs and reviewed my mistakes. The higher-ups gave me a few days to study the Marriage Law in my spare time. I studied it every day in my spare time, and after studying for more than ten days, I felt more and more that my mother and I had been wrong in the past. After everyone's analysis, criticism and help, my understanding was further improved. I was determined to be a good husband in the new era. And I was determined to persuade my mother and wife in a planned and step-by-step manner, and I must make them reconcile as well.

    Every time I went home, I persuaded my mother during the day and my wife in the evening. When Chunfeng heard me talk about the Marriage Law, she stared at me with her eyes, listening intently. My mother didn't like to listen at first, but over time, she also liked to listen a little, but she was still unwilling to say that she had been wrong in the past.

    Once, my mother got sick. Because Chunfeng often listened to my persuasion and explanations of the Marriage Law, she automatically boiled soup and decocted medicine for my mother. When I heard that my mother was sick and bought some snacks and rushed home, my mother was already well. My mother said very moved, "Qiu's mother (referring to Chunfeng) is really good. A few days ago, my body was so hot that I couldn't get out of bed. She boiled soup and decocted medicine for me, and also bought me sugar and noodles..." I said, "This is the result of her receiving the Marriage Law education." My mother said, "If it were in the past, after the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law disagreed and separated, who would care about who?" I struck while the iron was hot and started talking about the Marriage Law again. My mother kept nodding in agreement. Sometimes she was so absorbed in listening that she forgot to spin the thread. What excited me the most was that my mother actually happily admitted that she had been wrong in the past and said that she must change in the future. She said, "Men and women should be equal; mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law should also be harmonious. Everyone is human, and everyone should be equal. In the past, it was all my feudal brain's fault, I must change in the future."

    That day, my mother made me noodles. After the meal, she opened the snacks, left half, wrapped the other half, and told me to take them to Chunfeng. She also served a large bowl of noodles and said, "Chunfeng has a child, let her drink more salty soup." I followed my mother's good intentions and did everything accordingly. When I was about to leave, Chunfeng made dumplings for me. As soon as they were cooked, she served two bowls first and personally sent them to my mother.

    This year, during wheat harvest, my mother had just put out the wheat to dry when it started to rain. She put on a sheet, and took a pitchfork and walked to the threshing ground. As soon as she went out, she met Chunfeng coming back from the field. Knowing that her mother was going to the threshing ground to collect the wheat, she gave the hoe to her mother and snatched the pitchfork, saying, "Mom, you go back quickly!" After she finished speaking, she turned around and ran. When Chunfeng came back, her clothes, shoes and socks were all wet. As soon as she entered the door, her mother handed her a set of dry clothes and wiped the water from her head. Chunfeng changed into dry clothes and was very happy, but when she turned around, she saw her mother crying. Chunfeng stepped forward and held her mother and said, "Mom, how are you? Are you feeling unwell? I'll make you some hot soup!" Her mother didn't answer, and kept crying. After a while, her mother said with remorse, "Chunfeng, it was all my fault in the past, I shouldn't have treated you like that, now I regret it so much!..." Chunfeng didn't know what to do at this time, and said repeatedly, "Mom, don't say that, the past is over, it's really my fault for having a bad temper." Since then, the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law has become better and better. Whenever it was time to hoe the fields, Chunfeng would help her mother hoe first. Her mother also often helped Chunfeng cook and take care of the children. When I learned about these things, I was so happy.

    Now I deeply realize that: The old society and old ideas caused my family to be broken and destroyed; the new society and new ideas have made my family live a happy and fulfilling life. I am grateful for the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and I am grateful for the Marriage Law. In the future, I am determined to promote the Marriage Law well, and I must make the spirit of the Marriage Law known to every household.

    用自我批评方法解决夫妻、婆媳纠纷的一例
    苗静
    河北省沙河县各机关干部最近学习婚姻法，有好些同志根据文件检查了自己的封建思想与作风。下面是信托公司干部康清和在一个会上的典型报告的记录。
    我家在沙河县渡口村。我只念过小学，以后就光做生意。早先我曾娶过一个老婆。两人感情本来不坏，可是母亲的封建家长统治思想太厉害，经常无故骂她。有时我老婆和她顶嘴，母亲就叫我打她。我怕别人说我“不孝顺”，就真的动手打她。以后母亲自己也打她。她受气不过，终于悄悄地带上一个小孩跑了。当时我心里很难过，很后悔。但那时我的后悔，并不是因为懂得了男女应当平等的道理，而是觉得家里穷，怕再寻不上老婆。
    解放不久，我参加了革命工作。经过媒人的说合和双方的同意，我另和春凤结婚了。春凤从小就没了娘，劳动特别好，又是纺织组的小组长，思想也很进步。我家在土地改革中分了房和地，生活好了，母亲的脾气也好了些。她俩在一块和好了有半年，母亲的旧病又犯了。她开始嘟囔着骂春凤。最初春凤不好意思还嘴；后来母亲越来越凶。春凤急了，索性一点也不受了。她们就吵闹起来。
    我因为受了革命的教育，看不下去，就不断地劝说母亲。我说：“娘，你这么大年纪了，以后咱家里的事情，你也该歇歇心了。自从咱分了房和地，光景比过去强多了。春凤虽然性子不好，可是会过日子，也很勤俭。”母亲因为我不断地劝说，倒也听一点，但有时候就把嘴一噘，说：“光说怨我多管闲事，可是一个女人家，成天光开会，这个不用说了，算是为了工作。你看看她的嘴有多硬！竟敢跟婆婆吵。俺当媳妇的时候，谁敢跟婆婆还嘴！”
    晚上，我也劝说春凤。大意说：“不管咱娘怎么吵，反正你别和她还嘴。”春凤说：“我以前可没有还过嘴，可是也没有少挨了骂。有一点不合意就骂，这还有个完没有！”
    有一次我劝春凤，她反跟我吵起来了。我急了，就说：“管她骂你不骂，反正不许你还嘴！”她说：“我没有过错，她骂我就不行！”我说：“你还嘴我就不依！”她说：“你不依？爱怎么办就怎么办！”我急了，还没有等她说完，就咚咚打了她两拳。她没有哼声，拿起个条帚就狠狠地打了我两下。我没顾得穿衣裳就跳起来和她打开了。后来邻居听见我们打吵都来了，我们才住了手。
    春凤开开门，抱起孩子就往外走。我心里真有点着急，生怕她也跑了。幸亏民主妇女联合会主任来了，拦住了她。可是她说什么也不回来。最后她被劝到妇联会主任家里去了，我才放了心。
    春凤非要和我离婚不行。妇联会主任劝了她一夜，最后她提出：要不离婚，就得和母亲分家。我支支吾吾地没有理她，心想呆两天也许就好了。谁知道不分家她就不回来，呆了三、四天，我实在没办法了，只得劝说我母亲分家罢。起初母亲不同意，她说：“我养活你这么大，现在跟我分家！分家就分家，房子地都是我的，你们愿意到那里就到那里！”我再三劝说母亲：“她那样倔强，你们俩在一块实在呆不下去，倒不如分开家，你也少生些闲气。就是分开家，我也不能不养活你！”
    家总算是分清了。让母亲挑了三间好房，又多给了她二亩好地。从此以后，春凤也舒心了。白天她照旧到地里劳动，夜里领导妇女纺织，并且比过去更加积极了。
    我回到机关，家里的事一点也没敢提。可是上级终于知道我打老婆了，把我批评了一顿。我自己也虚心地承认了错误，并认识到打人是不对的，自己还有“男尊女卑”的封建思想，我下决心要改过。
    从此以后，我自认为我的思想真正变新了。可是我总觉得老婆就必须侍候男人。谁知道这一点没有检讨出来加以分析批判，就又闯了祸。
    有一次我下乡收购棉花回来，路过我家。那天春凤因为请人家拉了两车菜，没钱买油，不能管人家饭，正在发愁。一见我进来就没好气，嫌我不往家里捎钱，把钱都给了母亲。我俩免不了又顶了几句嘴。我叫她给盛水，她说：“你自己没长着手？”我一听真有点火，可是也不愿意惹她。当时我就想走，向她要衣服。她说：“你也没给买棉花，也没给买布，我没有给你做好衣裳。”天这样冷了，棉衣还没有给我做，又连水都不给我盛，气得我一脚就把桌子底下的破砂锅踢坏了。砂锅里盛的豆种撒了一地。她也急了，拿起桌上的茶壶就要摔。我说：“你反了！”上去就夺了过来。
    两个人争持不下，就跑到区政府，找到了侯秘书。侯秘书费了好大力气，把春凤劝回去了。然后跑来劝我说：“老康，你自己好好想一想吧，人家春凤那一样差？你尽实行‘大男子主义’对不对？婚姻法颁布了好几个月了，你也不好好学习一下。春凤给我倒了半天苦水。你说你工作忙，人家在家也比你不闲一点。她一天到晚种地，纺花，做饭，看孩子，连一会儿都没有闲过。就这样你还嫌人家侍候你不周到。你想想对不对？现在正在宣传婚姻法，咱要不以身作则，怎能领导群众？怎能向别人宣传？”接着，侯秘书又给我详细地解释了婚姻法的精神，如男女平等，婚姻自由等。并举出许多例子来教育我。这使我深深感到惭愧。
    我回到家的时候，春凤刚刚睡下。我向她承认了我的错误。春凤倒不好意思起来，她快活地说：“过去的，不用提了，以后我们好好的就是了。”她二句话没说，就起来给我做饭去了。我也去帮着她，两人都高兴得了不得。饭后躺在炕上，我俩一直谈到夜深，比新婚时还亲热。我回到机关，汇报了工作，又谈了谈自己的家务，并检讨了自己的错误。上级给我几天时间，叫我抽空学习婚姻法。我每天抽空学习，一连学习了十几天，越学越感到自己和母亲过去的不对。又经过大家的分析批判和帮助，我的认识进一步提高了。我下定决心要做一个新时代的好丈夫。并决心有计划、有步骤地去劝解母亲和妻子，一定要叫她们也和好起来。
    我每回一次家，都是白天劝母亲，晚间劝妻子。春凤一听我讲婚姻法，就两眼望着我，凝神地听。我母亲起初不爱听，可是久而久之，她也有点爱听了，就是还不愿意说自己过去不对。
    有一次母亲病了，春凤因为时常听我劝说，听我讲解婚姻法，就自动地给母亲熬汤、煎药。当我听说母亲有病，买了些点心赶到家时，母亲的病已经好了。母亲很感动地对我说：“秋的娘（指春凤）可真不错。前几天我身上烧得不能下炕，她给我熬汤、煎药，还给我买糖，买挂面……。”我说：“这都是她受婚姻法教育的结果。”母亲说：“要像过去，婆媳不和分开家以后，谁还理谁？”我就趁热打铁，重新讲开婚姻法了。母亲不断地点头称是。有时听得入神，连线都忘记纺了。最使我兴奋的，是母亲竟愉快地承认了自己过去的不对，并说今后一定要转变。她说：“男女就是应该平等；婆媳也应该和和气气的。大家都是人，都应该平等。过去都怨我这个封建脑袋，今后可要转变转变了。”
    这天母亲给我做了面条。饭后，她把点心打开，留下一半，把另一半包好，叫我给春凤拿过去。还盛了一大碗面条，说：“春凤有小孩，让她多喝点咸汤好。”我遵照母亲的这番好意，一切照办了。在我临走时，春凤给我包的饺子，刚煮好，她就先盛了两碗，亲自给母亲送过去。
    今年麦天，我母亲刚晒上麦子，天就下起雨来。她披上个单子、拿着杈就往场里走。刚一出门，碰见春凤从地里回来。她知道母亲要去场里收拾麦子，就把锄给了母亲，夺过杈来说：“娘，你赶快回去罢！”说完扭回头就跑了。春凤回来的时候，衣裳鞋袜都湿了。她一进门，母亲递给她一套干衣裳，还给她擦头上的水。春凤换上干衣服，心里可愉快了，可是扭脸一看，母亲却正在一边流眼泪。春凤上前拉住母亲说：“娘，你身上怎么样了？不舒服吗？我给你做点热汤喝吧！”母亲没有回答，还是流泪。一会儿，母亲懊悔地说：“春凤，过去都是我的不好，我不该那样对待你，现在我后悔死了！……”春凤这时不知道怎样才好，连声说道：“娘，别这么说，过去的就算过去了，实在也怨我的性子不好。”从此以后，婆媳越来越好。每逢该锄地了，春凤就先帮母亲锄。母亲也经常帮助春凤做饭看孩子。我知道了这些事，真高兴得了不得。
    现在我深刻地体验到：旧社会，旧思想，害得我家破人亡；新社会，新思想，使我家过着美满和幸福的生活。我感谢共产党和人民政府的领导，我感谢婚姻法。今后我下定决心，要好好宣传婚姻法，一定要把婚姻法的精神叫家家户户都知道。
