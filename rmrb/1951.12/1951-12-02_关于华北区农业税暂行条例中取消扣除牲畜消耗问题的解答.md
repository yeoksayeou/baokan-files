Editor's Note: The Interim Regulations on Agricultural Tax in the North China Region, promulgated by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on October 25, 1951, did not include the content stipulated in Items 1 and 2 of Chapter 3, Article 14 of the former Interim Regulations on Agricultural Tax in the North China Region, which deducted 0.4 standard mu for each head of cattle and donkey, and 0.7 standard mu for each head of mule and horse. Many readers have written to inquire about the reasons. The answer from the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government is as follows:

When the former North China People's Government formulated the interim regulations on agricultural tax for the region, the area was in a state of war, and the burden of war service on animal power was quite heavy (at that time, transportation mainly relied on pack animals and human backs). In addition, the enemy frantically robbed and killed draft animals, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of draft animals. In order to develop agricultural production and support the People's Liberation War, the former North China People's Government specifically stipulated in the interim regulations on agricultural tax for the region that 0.4 standard mu would be deducted for each head of cattle and donkey, and 0.7 standard mu would be deducted for each head of mule and horse, to encourage the breeding of livestock, especially mules and horses. This played a certain positive role in developing agricultural production and supporting the war at that time. Therefore, deducting livestock consumption was correct at that time.

Why is the deduction of draft animal consumption now canceled? The reason is: The people's revolutionary war on the mainland has achieved victory. Except for cultivation on behalf of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, there is no war service burden in the North China region. Moreover, most of the North China region has completed land reform, the masses' production level has improved, and the number of agricultural tools and draft animals purchased by farmers has increased year by year. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to deduct draft animal consumption at present. Moreover, most households raising draft animals are currently those with higher incomes and better living standards, while households without draft animals are mostly poor peasants. If the deduction of livestock consumption continues, it will create an imbalance in the agricultural tax burden, resulting in those with higher incomes bearing less burden and those with lower incomes bearing a relatively heavier burden. Based on the above situation, canceling the deduction of draft animal consumption will not only not affect agricultural production, but will also make the farmers' burden more fair and reasonable.

    关于华北区农业税暂行条例中取消扣除牲畜消耗问题的解答
    编者按：中央人民政府政务院一九五一年十月二十五日颁布的华北区农业税暂行条例，没有包括前华北区农业税暂行税则中第三章第十四条一、二两项所规定的牛、驴每头扣除一个标准亩的十分之四，骡、马每头扣除一个标准亩的十分之七的内容。不少读者来信询问原因，现经中央人民政府财政部解答如下：
    前华北人民政府制定该区农业税暂行税则时，该地区正处于战争状态，畜力的战勤负担颇多（当时的交通运输主要是靠牲口驮和人背），加以当时敌人疯狂抢、杀耕畜，以致耕畜大量减少。为了发展农业生产和支援人民解放战争，前华北人民政府制定该区农业税暂行税则时，特规定牛、驴每头扣除一个标准亩的十分之四，骡、马每头扣除一个标准亩的十分之七，以奖励繁殖牲畜，特别奖励养骡、养马。这样作，对当时发展农业生产和支援战争起了一定的积极作用。因此当时扣除牲畜的消耗是正确的。
    现在为什么取消扣除耕畜的消耗呢？原因是：大陆上的人民革命战争已取得胜利，华北地区除了为烈、军、工属代耕之外，没有什么战勤负担了。且华北绝大部分地区已完成了土地改革，群众的生产水平已经提高，农民购买农具、耕畜的数量逐年增多。因此，目前扣除耕畜的消耗已无必要。而且目前一般养耕畜户多是收入较多，生活较好者，而无耕畜户又多系贫苦农民；如果再继续扣除牲畜消耗，又会产生农业税负担上的不平衡现象，形成收入多的少负担，收入少的相对多负担。根据上述情况，取消扣除耕畜的消耗一项，不仅不会影响农业生产，而且将使农民负担更加趋于公平合理。
