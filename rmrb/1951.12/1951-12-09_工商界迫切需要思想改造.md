    The Industrial and Commercial Sector Urgently Needs Ideological Remolding
    Zhu Jisheng, Vice-Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce
    At the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao, in addition to calling for increased production and strict economy to support the just war of resisting America and aiding Korea, also called on intellectuals of all kinds to actively launch a self-education and self-remolding movement. Now, people in cultural and educational circles have launched an ideological remolding movement in full swing. Many in the industrial and commercial sector are intellectuals, and they should also actively respond to this call, carry out in-depth ideological remolding work, so that we can move forward steadily and create conditions for realizing democratic reforms and implementing industrialization.
    Before liberation, living in that dark and corrupt society, it is undeniable that we industrialists and businessmen, including myself, almost all had more or less selfish and self-interested psychology, thinking of everything only for ourselves or for our own unit, and lacking a mass viewpoint and spirit of unity and mutual assistance; we also often looked down on labor, were arrogant and conceited, were neither democratic, nor did we know the greatness of the working class's strength and wisdom. Because we started from personal interests, we were hesitant, wavering, and unstable, without any revolutionary fighting will. On the one hand, we were subjected to the dual oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capital; on the other hand, in order to make profits, we relied on them, and even colluded with them.
    Since liberation, our industrialists and businessmen have indeed made a lot of progress. Especially after the patriotic education of the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we have a new understanding of our great motherland, greater confidence in the People's Government, and increased hatred for imperialism. In the donation movement, the industrial and commercial sector contributed its strength and demonstrated its patriotic enthusiasm. Although we did not understand the Communist Party very well in the early days of liberation, in the past two or three years, the improvement of international status and the rapid progress of domestic economic construction and cultural undertakings, especially the stability of prices and the smooth flow of materials, have made industrialists and businessmen deeply realize that the People's Government is indeed a government that serves the people, and the Chinese Communist Party is indeed a political party that seeks happiness for the people.
    However, in the vast industrial and commercial sector, some are advanced, some are relatively poor, and some are still backward. Therefore, there are still many complex ideological problems in the industrial and commercial sector, and we urgently need to organize ourselves and work together to overcome various ideological errors.
    First of all, the common problem of the general industrial and commercial sector is freedom and laxity. Although we have been studying for more than two years, this morbid state still exists to some extent, and I am no exception. When there are meetings, we come if we want to, leave if we want to, and are casually late or early. Some only want fame and fortune, but are not responsible for their work. For their own enterprises, they often operate in a careless and perfunctory manner. As for myself, in the past two or three years, because my Renli Industrial Company has been developing and its business has become increasingly complex, the old systems and institutions are not enough to cope with it. I have followed the old ways and sought temporary ease, failing to seize the time to mobilize the masses and change the organization and system, resulting in complacency, a lot of waste, and even underreporting tax amounts, bordering on deceiving the government. This kind of behavior urgently needs to be corrected, and only by studying the rectification documents of the Communist Party, deeply examining ourselves, and using the methods of criticism and self-criticism can we gradually achieve the effect of transformation.
    Secondly, in terms of labor-capital relations, enterprise leaders, especially managers and shopkeepers in small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, still do not understand the policy of labor-capital benefit and the significance of democratic management. Because they are unwilling to put down their airs, they still retain the old feudal system in management. As a result, labor-capital disputes continue to occur, production cannot be developed, and there are even cases of beating apprentices and insulting workers, all of which are due to the fact that the remnants of the old society's ideology have not been washed away. Of course, it is also wrong to take a negative attitude towards labor-capital relations.
    Thirdly, in terms of public-private relations, in the process of fulfilling contracts for processing, ordering, purchasing, and sales on commission, some industrialists and businessmen often cut corners, produce shoddy goods, and even fail to fulfill contracts in order to seek exorbitant profits. In addition, there are also cases of excessively low processing fees and prices, which require both parties to work hard to reasonably adjust public-private relations.
    There is also a very common wrong idea, to be honest, I used to have it too, that is: seeing the vigorous development of state-owned enterprises, I thought that private enterprises would be squeezed out and it would be difficult to have a future. The Common Program clearly instructs us that all private economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are encouraged and supported by the government, but all undertakings related to the national economic lifeline and sufficient to manipulate the people's livelihood should be operated uniformly by the state. It can be seen that the scope of private enterprises has been stipulated, and its direction is also very clear, that is, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, it cooperates with other social economic components, each performing its own functions, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy. Therefore, private industrialists and businessmen should not have the slightest doubt about the prospects for development.
    Finally, what we in the industrial and commercial sector should regard as a great shame is that even today, two or three years after liberation, many incidents of speculation and profiteering have occurred in big cities in an attempt to make exorbitant profits. For example, the case of unscrupulous merchants deceiving the government in the ordering of military raincoats in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, and the case of Ren Haiqi, manager of the Shanghai Manufacturers' North China Joint Office, illegally seeking exorbitant profits. This kind of profiteering ideology harms the interests of the state and also harms the interests of the industrialists and businessmen themselves. In the past two years, the government and the people together have used great efforts to achieve price stability, so that the lives of the people across the country can be guaranteed, and industry and commerce can develop smoothly. Therefore, those who speculate, hoard goods, and deceive the government to seek exorbitant profits are not in line with the interests of the people. The Chinese people are engaged in a difficult struggle with the American imperialist aggressors. If we disrupt the market in the rear and damage the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, wouldn't we be losing our conscience and betraying the soldiers who are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves in the frozen and snowy land to defend the motherland?
    In short, many ideological problems in our industrial and commercial sector urgently need to be overcome. These ideological problems are mostly due to the mischief of individualism. If we want to transform our thinking, we must voluntarily learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When learning, we must also combine it with our own thinking at any time, and use the new thinking to examine our own old thinking. We must use the methods of criticism and self-criticism to carry out a thorough transformation, so that our selfish and self-interested consciousness can be changed into a world outlook of serving the people. This is a great struggle, and it may also be a painful process. In addition, in practical work, we must also learn with an open mind in order to obtain various practical experiences.
    Comrades in the industrial and commercial sector! In the past, we made very little contribution to the revolutionary cause. On the contrary, intentionally or unintentionally, tangibly or intangibly, we may have even been accomplices of imperialism. Since liberation, we have participated in the regime and become the masters of the country. This is the time for us to repay the motherland. We must catch up and carry out self-education and self-transformation, so that we can unite with people of other classes and move forward together to jointly implement the central task given to us by Chairman Mao—increasing production and practicing economy to support our Chinese People's Volunteers.

    工商界迫切需要思想改造
    天津市工商业联合会副主任委员  朱继圣
    毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上，除号召增加生产，厉行节约，以支援抗美援朝的正义战争外，又号召了各种知识分子积极展开一个自我教育和自我改造运动。现在文教界人士已经轰轰烈烈地掀起了思想改造运动。工商界中很多是知识分子，也应该积极响应这个号召，深入地进行思想改造工作，使我们能够稳步前进，为实现民主改革及实行工业化创造条件。
    解放以前，生活在那个黑暗腐朽的社会里，不可否认的，我们工商业者包括我个人在内，几乎个个存有或多或少的自私自利心理，一切非为个人着想，就为本位着想，同时缺乏群众观点和团结互助的精神；又往往轻视劳动，自高自大，既不民主，更不知工人阶级的力量和智慧的伟大。因为从个人利益出发，瞻前顾后，动摇不稳，毫无革命斗争的意志。一方面受着帝国主义和官僚资本的双重压迫；另一方面为了有利可图，就依靠他们，甚至与他们勾结在一起。
    解放以来，我们工商业者确实进步了不少。尤其经过抗美援朝，土地改革及镇压反革命三大运动的爱国主义教育，我们对伟大的祖国有了新的认识，对人民政府有更大的信心，对帝国主义加强了仇恨。在捐献运动中，工商界贡献了自己的力量，发挥了爱国的热忱。虽在解放初期对共产党确实不甚了解，但两三年来，国际地位的提高和国内经济建设与文化事业的突飞猛进，尤其是物价的稳定和物资的畅流，使工商业者深深地体会到人民政府确是为人民服务的政府，中国共产党确是为人民谋幸福的政党。
    但是在广大的工商界中，一部分虽是前进的；一部分就比较差一些；又一部分还是落后的。所以工商界里还存在着好些复杂的思想问题，我们迫切需要组织起来，共同努力来克服种种思想上的错误。
    首先，一般工商界的通病是自由散漫，虽学习了两年有余，这个病态多少还是存在着，我个人也不是例外。开会的时候，爱来就来，爱走就走，随便迟到早退。有的只要名利，做事则不负责任。对自己的企业，往往也就粗枝大叶马马虎虎地来经营。就我个人来说，两三年来，因我仁立实业公司在发展中业务日繁，旧有的制度和机构不够应付，我乃因循求事，不抓紧时间来发动群众，改变组织和制度，以至麻痹大意，发生很多的浪费，甚至漏报税额，迹近欺骗政府。这类作风，急需痛改，也只有学习共产党的整风文件，深刻检讨自己，展开批评与自我批评的方法，才能得到逐渐改造的效果。
    其次，在劳资关系方面，企业负责人尤其是中小工商业的经理和掌柜们，还有好些不甚了解劳资两利的政策和民主管理的意义。因为不肯放下架子，管理上还保存了旧的封建制度。结果，劳资纠纷不断地发生，生产也无法发展，甚至有殴打学徒侮辱工人的，这都由于旧社会思想的残余还未洗净的缘故。当然，对劳资关系抱消极主义的态度也是不对的。
    再次，在公私关系方面，工商业者在履行加工、订货、代购、代销等合同过程中，有的往往偷工减料，粗制滥造，甚至不履行合同，以谋暴利。另外，也有工缴费与价格过低的，需要双方努力合理地调整公私关系。
    还有一个很普遍错误的思想，老实说，我从前也曾经有过，就是：见了国营企业的蓬勃发展就以为私营企业将被挤垮，难有发展的前途。共同纲领明确地指示我们，凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业均受政府的鼓励和扶助，但凡属有关国家经济命脉和足以操纵国民生计的事业，均应由国家统一经营。可见私营企业的范围已有规定，其方向也甚明确，即在国营经济领导之下与其他社会经济成分，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。所以私营工商业者对发展的前途不应有丝毫疑虑。
    最后，我们工商界应引以为奇耻的，解放两三年后的今天，在大城市里还发生了好些投机倒把企图暴利的事件。例如北京、天津、青岛三市军用雨衣定货奸商欺骗政府，上海厂商华北联合办事处经理任海岐等非法牟取暴利等案。这种暴利思想损害了国家利益，也损害了工商业者自己的利益。两年来，政府和人民一起，用了很大的力量，才得到了物价的稳定，使全国人民的生活能有保障，工商业也得以顺利发展。所以投机取巧，囤积居奇，欺骗政府牟取暴利之徒，是与人民的利益不相符合的。中国人民正和美帝国主义侵略者作着艰苦的斗争，我们如在后方扰乱市场，损害抗美援朝的力量，岂不是丧失良心，辜负了在冰天雪地中为保卫祖国而流血牺牲的战士们么？
    总而言之，我们工商界里好些思想问题是急待克服的。这些思想问题多由于个人主义的作祟。我们要改造思想，必须自动自愿地来学习马列主义和毛泽东思想。在学习的时候，还要随时结合自己思想，用新思想检讨自己的旧思想。用批评与自我批评的方法来进行彻底的改造，使我们自私自利的意识改变为为人民服务的人生观。这是一个伟大的斗争，也可能是一个痛苦的过程。此外，在实践工作当中，我们还要虚心学习以求得种种实际的体会。
    工商界同志们！我们在过去对革命事业很少贡献，相反地，有意无意，有形无形地我们或者还做过帝国主义的帮凶。解放以来，我们参与了政权，做了国家的主人，这是我们报效祖国的时机，我们应急起直追，进行自我教育和自我改造，庶几乎能与其他阶层人民团结一起齐头前进，共同实行毛主席给予我们的中心任务——增产节约以支持我们中国人民志愿军。
