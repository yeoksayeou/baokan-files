Tian Yonglin of Fengrong Village, Ninth District, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, harvested a total of thirty-three shi of wheat from his three qing and three mu of land, averaging ten shi per qing (each shi is calculated as 500 jin, totaling 5,000 jin), setting a new record for high yield on a large area of land. Tian Yonglin's three qing and three mu of wheat land yielded five shi of wheat per qing last year, more than one shi per qing more than others. This year, he paid special attention to improving technology, selecting "Kehua" wheat seeds with a purity of over 90%, and disinfecting them with copper oxychloride. He also applied twenty cartloads of soil fertilizer per qing of land (the same amount as last year and the year before). Sowing began on April 1st, half a month earlier than last year, using the method of small ridges pressing against large ridges (that is, planting with closer ridge spacing than usual), with uniform spacing between plants. After sowing, he rolled the land once, and the seedlings emerged vigorously, resisting the spring drought. The harvest was also timely this year, starting on July 28th when the wheat was yellow and ripe, avoiding the loss of grain from harvesting during the dry and ripe period. Therefore, Tian Yonglin achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. According to an investigation by the Hailun County Agricultural Science Department, the key to Tian Yonglin's increased production lies in his ability to continuously fertilize the land, constantly improving soil fertility, combined with the improvement of other technologies.

    黑龙江海伦丰荣村田永林
    创小麦丰产新纪录
    黑龙江省海伦县第九区丰荣村田永林，今年种植的三垧三亩小麦共收获三十三石，每垧平均产量十石（每石按五百斤计算，合五千斤），创大片土地丰产的新纪录。田永林的三垧三亩麦地，去年每垧就曾收获五石小麦，比别人每垧多打一石多。今年他特别注意改进技术，选择“克华”小麦种籽，纯度在百分之九十以上，而且用王铜消毒，每垧地上二十车土粪（去年、前年也都是上这么多粪）。在四月一日播种，比去年早半月，采用小垄压大垄办法（即比一般地垄距离密些）种植，株间距离均匀，种后又用磙子压了一遍，小苗出来时很旺，抗过了春旱。今年收割也较适时，在七月二十八日小麦黄熟期开镰，避免了枯熟期收割落粒的损失。因此田永林今年得到了空前的丰收。根据海伦县农业科调查，田永林的增产关键，在于能够连年施肥，不断增进地力，再加其他技术的提高。
