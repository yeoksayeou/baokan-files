    Doing a Good Job of Drought Prevention Preparation in Winter

    The construction of farmland water conservancy is one of the important conditions for increasing agricultural production. According to past experience, this work should be prepared as early as possible in winter.

    China has a vast territory, and the natural conditions vary greatly from place to place. Therefore, the construction of farmland water conservancy should be carried out separately according to the specific situation. In North and Northwest China, a winter watering (including spring watering) and water storage and ice cultivation campaign should be launched from now on. Years of experience have shown that winter watering has a great effect on preventing drought and protecting seedlings for crops in the coming year. Local governments must attach importance to leading this work. Peasants in areas where winter watering is not a custom should be educated and organized to ensure that all possible winter-watered fields are winter-watered. The method of storing water and cultivating ice was created by Li Hewang, a water conservancy labor model in Chahar Province. The so-called water storage and ice cultivation is to try to block the flow of water in winter, so that it gradually forms thick ice, which can be used for irrigation of farmland after it melts in the coming spring. This drought prevention method is simple and easy to implement and should be vigorously promoted. Local governments should convene representative conferences on farmland water conservancy during the winter slack season to formulate plans for the construction of farmland water conservancy, summarize experience in irrigation management, repair channels and sluice dams, check the production status of waterwheels, and make specific preparations for the large-scale promotion of waterwheels and well digging.

    In the Jiangnan and Southwest regions, it is currently the season for building ponds and dams. Local governments should rely on the grassroots water conservancy organizations of townships or villages to mobilize sufficient manpower to carry out this work as soon as possible. And should send technical personnel to assist farmers to improve the quality of ponds and dams and expand the amount of water storage. In areas where windmills, bucket wheels, and dragon-bone waterwheels are used in large quantities, necessary repairs and supplements should be carried out during the slack winter time for farmers. In areas that are frequently flooded, attention should be paid to the cultivation and repair of dikes and the dredging of ditches.

    We believe that, after this serious preparation in the coming winter, local governments and the broad masses of peasants will certainly be able to make the farmland water conservancy work next year better than this year, and overcome possible droughts to a certain extent, and ensure the increase of yield per unit area.

    在冬季做好防旱准备工作
    兴修农田水利是增加农业生产的重要条件之一。根据历年经验，这一工作应在冬季及早准备。
    我国地区辽阔，各地自然条件差异极大，因此，兴修农田水利，应该按照具体情况，分别进行。在华北、西北地区，应从现在起，展开一个冬浇（包括春浇）和蓄水养冰运动。几年来的经验说明，冬浇对来年农作物的防旱保苗，有极大作用。各地政府必须重视领导这一工作。对没有冬浇习惯地区的农民，应进行教育和组织工作，务使一切可能冬浇的田地，一律实行冬浇。蓄水养冰方法，是察哈尔省水利劳动模范李河旺创造的。所谓蓄水养冰，就是在冬天设法阻塞住流水的去路，使它逐渐结成厚冰，以供来春融化后灌溉田地。这种防旱方法，简单易行，应该大力推广。各地政府应在冬闲期间，召开农田水利代表会议，制订兴修农田水利计划，总结灌溉管理经验，整修渠道和闸坝，检查水车生产状况，做好大量推广水车和打井的具体准备工作。
    在江南和西南地区，目前正是兴修塘坝季节。各地政府应该依靠乡或村的基层水利组织，动员足够的人力，早日进行这一工作。并应派遣技术人员，协助农民，提高塘坝质量，扩大蓄水量。在大量使用风车、筒车和龙骨水车的地区，应该抓紧农民冬闲时间，进行必要的修理和补充。在经常受涝灾的地区，应该注意堤圩的培修和沟洫的疏浚。
    我们相信，各地政府和广大农民，经过今冬这一次认真的准备，一定可以使明年农田水利工作比今年作得更好，并在一定程度内克服可能发生的旱灾，保证单位面积产量的提高。
