    Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory's Certain Cadres
    Undemocratic Work Style Affects Production
    Comrade Editor: The People's Daily published an article on December 8th regarding the wasteful situation at the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory. The main reason for the waste is that some cadres in the factory have an undemocratic work style, and most workers are afraid to offer opinions to the leadership. For example, Wang Chengjun, the director of the personnel section, routinely summons workers to the personnel section for self-criticism. He sometimes even uses salary suspensions to intimidate workers. The personnel section only punishes and never rewards when enforcing regulations. Over the past year, many people have received demerits and warnings, but no one has received an award. In fact, it is not that there are no people who deserve rewards. For example, after implementing the Kovalev work method in the rolling mill's Group B, productivity increased by 20%, but the personnel section did not pay attention to it. When workers are occasionally late, the personnel section does not educate and persuade them but scolds them as if they were being interrogated. Most workers have the idea of "eat more, talk less," which reduces their enthusiasm for production. I believe that the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory should carry out a democratic reform movement to lay a good foundation for launching the campaign to increase production and practice thrift.

### 天津钢铁配件厂某些干部  作风不民主影响了生产

    天津钢铁配件厂某些干部
    作风不民主影响了生产
    编辑同志：关于天津钢铁配件厂的浪费情况，十二月八日的人民日报上已刊载了。产生浪费的主要原因是厂里有些干部作风不民主，大部分工人不敢向领导方面提意见。像人事股主任王承君，动不动就把工友喊到人事股去反省。他有时更用停薪来吓唬工人。人事股在执行制度上是光惩不奖。一年来，记过、受警告的人很多，得奖的人却一个也没有。事实上并不是没有应奖励的人，如压延间乙班实行郭瓦廖夫工作法后，生产率提高百分之二十，人事股却不加重视。工人们偶然迟到时，人事股不是教育说服，而是像审问似的训斥。工人们大都有
    “多吃饭、少说话”的思想，生产情绪因而降低。我认为天津钢铁配件厂应搞好民主改革运动，为开展增产节约运动打好基础。    杨恩庆
