    Increase Production and Practice Economy to Support Our Most Beloved People
    Labor Model Wang Deshan
    The workers of each group in our state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory's No. 2 and No. 3 Weaving Workshops are actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call to increase production and practice economy. Our group took the lead in proposing that in November and December, the rate of first-class cloth should reach 96.65% (the administrative plan was 94%). Other groups have also put forward their own standards. Some groups have proposed to save shuttles, and some have proposed to save picking sticks. The second group of the third workshop plans to save eighty leather hammers in two months. As a result of everyone's calculations in all aspects, our No. 2 and No. 3 Weaving Workshops have decided to save 260 million yuan in November and December.

    We have sufficient strength to increase production and practice economy. Take October as an example, our No. 2 and No. 3 Weaving Workshops saved more than 170 million yuan for the country from reducing substandard cloth, saving labor, and saving machinery and materials in order to donate weapons. We have full confidence in completing the production increase and economy plan for November and December. At the recently concluded National Weaving Work Method Conference, led by Comrade Chen Shaomin, we summarized the "1951 Weaving Work Method." I guarantee to quickly promote this new working method to the entire factory, increase production and practice economy even better, and support our most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    增产节约支援我们最可爱的人
    劳动模范 王德山
    我们国营天津第二棉纺织厂二、三织布场每一个小组的职工，都在积极响应毛主席增产节约的伟大号召。我们小组首先提出在十一、十二两月份，正布率要达到百分之九十六点六五（行政计划为百分之九十四）。别的小组也都提出了自己的标准。有的小组还提出要节省梭子；有的提出要节省打梭棍。三厂第二组计划两个月要节省八十个皮鎯头。大家从各方面计算的结果，我们二、三织布场在十一、十二两个月内，决定要节约两亿六千多万元。
    我们有着充分的力量进行增产节约。就拿十月份说吧，我们二、三织布场为捐献武器，就从减少次布、节省人工、机物料等方面，为国家节约了一亿七千余万元。十一、十二月份的增产节约计划，我们更是有充分的信心来完成它。在最近闭幕的全国织布工作法会议上，由陈少敏同志领导着我们总结出了“一九五一织布工作法”。我保证迅速把这个新的工作方法推广到全厂，更好地增产节约，支援我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。（附图片）
