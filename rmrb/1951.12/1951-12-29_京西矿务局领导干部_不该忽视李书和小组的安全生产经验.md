Leading Cadres of the Jingxi Mining Bureau
Should Not Neglect the Safety Production Experience of Li Shuhe's Team

    The production team of Li Shuhe, a labor model from the Chengzikuang mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, has worked in unity and mutual assistance, eliminated ideological obstacles, established various safety systems, and improved technology. As a result, they have had no work-related injuries in twenty-seven months. However, the Jingxi Mining Area has not promoted their advanced experience. The main reason is that the leading cadres of the Party, administration, and trade union of the Jingxi Mining Bureau have not paid attention to these advanced experiences.
    The Jingxi Mining Area Trade Union has not summarized the experience of Li Shuhe's team very well. Although they once hastily "summarized" the experience of Li Shuhe's team and published it in the "Jingxi Miner" newspaper; and also invited Li Shuhe to make a typical report at the mining area's labor model conference and the all-mine employee representative conference; however, they have never seriously and systematically summarized the experience of Li Shuhe's team, let alone formulated specific promotion plans and methods, and proactively asked the Party committee and administrative leading cadres for help. They simply mimeographed the hastily summarized experience and distributed it to the grassroots trade unions of each mine. When distributing, they neither explained the important significance of promoting advanced experience, nor told the lower-level trade unions how to organize workers to study, and did not conduct inspections afterward. After reading this material, some grassroots trade union cadres read it aloud at the employee congress, while others simply shelved it without mentioning it at all. The Heishan mine is only a little over a mile away from the Chengzikuang mine (where Li Shuhe's team is located), but the workers only know that Li Shuhe is a labor model, and few know what his model deeds are. Before May of this year, several serious injury accidents occurred in the mining area. At most, the leading cadres would broadcast one or two times to draw everyone's attention, and then it was over. No one thought of promoting the safety production experience of Li Shuhe's team to eliminate work-related injuries.
    The Party committee and the administrative leading cadres of the mining bureau also did not pay attention to promoting advanced experience. The Party committee neither helped the trade union promote advanced experience, nor urged the trade union to do it conscientiously. They completely abandoned their leadership and supervision responsibilities. In February of this year, the administrative cadres of the Chengzikuang mine said that there was no work to do and assigned Li Shuhe's team to do odd jobs such as repairing sidewalks, digging ditches, and blocking air doors. Other workers said: "Is this what the model team does!" Li Shuhe's team originally had forty-five people, and now two-thirds of the old workers have been transferred away. The mining area party committee and the administrative leading cadres of the mining bureau have turned a blind eye to this phenomenon of not attaching importance to the cultivation of advanced teams. This is very wrong. (Liu Zhiheng)

### 京西矿务局领导干部  不该忽视李书和小组的安全生产经验

    京西矿务局领导干部
    不该忽视李书和小组的安全生产经验
    京西矿务局城子矿劳动模范李书和的生产小组，团结互助，扫除了思想障碍，建立了各种安全制度，提高了技术。因此，他们在二十七个月内没出过工伤事故。但是，京西矿区并没有推广他们的先进经验。主要的原因是京西矿务局的党、行政和工会的领导干部没有重视这些先进经验。
    京西矿区工会没有很好地总结过李书和小组的经验。他们虽然曾经潦草地“总结”了一下李书和小组的经验，发表在“京西矿工”报上；也请李书和在矿区劳动模范大会和全矿职工代表会上作了典型报告；可是，他们从来没有认真地系统地总结过李书和小组的经验，更没有订出具体的推广计划和方法，主动地要求党委和行政领导干部帮助。他们只是把潦草地总结出来的经验油印以后，发给各矿基层工会。分发时，他们既没有说明推广先进经验的重要意义，也没有告诉下级工会怎样组织工人学习，事后也没有作检查。基层工会干部看了这份材料后，有的在职工大会上宣读一遍，有的根本没有提，就把它高高地搁起来。黑山矿离城子矿（李书和小组所在的矿）才一里多地，可是工人只知道李书和是个劳动模范，究竟他的模范事迹是什么，知道的人就不多了。今年五月以前，矿区发生了好几次重伤事故，领导干部顶多广播一两次，引起大家注意就完了。谁也没有想到要推广李书和小组的安全生产经验，消灭工伤事故。
    矿区党委和矿务局的行政领导干部也没有重视推广先进经验。党委既不帮助工会推广先进经验，也不督促工会认真地去做。他们完全放弃了领导和监督的任务。今年二月，城子矿的行政干部说没活干，把李书和小组分配去做修人行道、挖水沟、堵风门等杂活。别的工人说：“模范组就干这个呀！”李书和小组原有四十五人，现在已有三分之二的老工人被调走了。像这种不重视培养先进小组的现象，矿区党委和矿务局的行政领导干部都漠然视之。这是很不应该的。    （刘志恒）
