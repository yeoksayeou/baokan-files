Excavation and Protection of Cultural Relics in the Suburbs of Beijing
     Zheng Zhenduo
    Beijing is a very ancient city. Tracing back to remote antiquity, the site where the Peking Man was discovered—Zhoukoudian—is located on the plain surrounding Beijing. Scholars have named this Chinese ape-man "Peking Man." These were the primitive humans living near present-day Beijing 500,000 years ago. Subsequently, primitive people living in this area, such as the Upper Cave Man, continued to create their history and culture, leaving behind some remains, artifacts, and daily necessities. The legendary battle between the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou in the Wilderness of Zhuolu took place on this plain. The first relatively credible record in recorded history is the enfeoffment of Duke Zhao of Shao in the State of Yan by King Wu of Zhou more than 3,000 years ago. Since then, feudal lords of successive dynasties have been very active in the vicinity of present-day Beijing. About 1,000 years ago, Emperor Taizong of Liao elevated Youzhou to Nanjing. Eight hundred years ago, Emperor Hailing of Jin established the capital in Yanjing. The formal history of Beijing began during this period. The Yuan Dynasty made Beijing its capital, Dadu. During the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty, Beijing was extensively built, and the capital was moved from Nanjing. The scale of today's Beijing was determined during the Yongle era (1403-1424 AD). The current style of Beijing has a history of 545 years.

    For countless ages, the people have lived and struggled on this fertile plain, creating countless tools of production and weapons with their wisdom and diligence to fight against nature and feudal lords; creating countless works of art to enrich their lives. They were born here, active here, singing and dancing here, performing countless moving stories of joys and sorrows. They died here and were buried here. Countless people and people's heroes, even feudal lords, were buried in the wilderness, along with their beloved works of art, daily necessities, and the immortal creations of the people. After many years, their tombs and the cultural relics buried in them were occasionally discovered under the plows of farmers. When we see those cultural relics, it is as if we are seeing the lives and activities of the people of that era. Here, what is unearthed is several pages of forgotten history, and several kinds of works of art created by the forgotten wisdom and diligence of the people. This is exciting and can make us feel close to them, and make us have infinite love for the creations of the ancient ancestors and the motherland that contains so many treasures. Through those cultural relics, it is not only enough to explain the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and thousands of years of history of Beijing, the capital of our people today, and the process of "social development" of the people who have been active on this fertile plain, but also enough to explain the process of social development of the entire China.

    In the past, no one paid attention to those unearthed cultural relics; some people only regarded them as objects of appreciation; no one linked them with the past social life, let alone sorted out and studied them; gradually, they forgot their place of origin and the various things unearthed with them, and looked at them one by one in isolation; completely lost their due value and the important meaning they contained.

    Since the founding of the Central People's Government, it has promulgated decrees on excavation and decrees on the protection of ancient cultural relics and mausoleums, attaching great importance to the cultural and artistic heritage of the nation. Not only is it passively protected, but also planned and systematic excavation work is carried out in order to obtain more and more sufficient information, which is sorted out, studied, and publicly displayed to explain various problems and to show the history of social development in China. The excavation work in the suburbs of Beijing is one example.

    Near Tangshan City (although Tangshan City is not in the suburbs of Beijing, it is also on the plain surrounding Beijing), we have discovered some bronzes similar to those unearthed in Liyu, and many bricks, tiles, and other pottery similar to those unearthed in Yixian. These are the earliest cultural relics discovered near Beijing in recorded history. This proves that in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there was a city with a large population near Beijing, and its cultural level was very high. In Gaobeidian Village in the eastern suburbs of Beijing and Zhufang Village in Qinghe Town in the northern suburbs, we have discovered some Han tombs. The Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Central Bureau of Cultural Relics, and the Beijing History Museum jointly organized an excavation team, which worked in those places for a period of time and obtained some Han Dynasty cultural relics, mainly pottery figurines, pottery houses, etc. The pottery figurines were made with molds and are somewhat similar to the Han figurines unearthed in Pengshan County, Sichuan. This also proves that in the Han Dynasty, the vicinity of Beijing was also a densely populated city, and the artistic style popular at that time was very similar to that of Sichuan and the Central Plains.

    Yangfang Village in Fengtai District has a cemetery area from the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and the Qinglongqiao and Hongshankou areas in the Western Hills are cemetery areas of the Ming Dynasty. We have not yet worked in Fengtai District, and we are working in Qinglongqiao District—in cooperation with the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Central Bureau of Cultural Relics—and have discovered many cultural relics with historical and artistic value. In that area, we once discovered a tomb of a concubine of Emperor Wuzong of the Ming Dynasty; she died during the Jiajing period. Her phoenix crown and her daily necessities were found in the tomb, including gold rings, bracelets, earrings, wine glasses, kettles, water trays, etc., some of which were gilded and silver. The production dates were as early as the sixth year of Zhengde. Some producers were titled: "Sui Jia Yu Yong Jian", and some were titled: "Silver Workshop." The production technology is very sophisticated. We also discovered some tombs of eunuchs from the early Ming Dynasty. One eunuch from the Yongle period, named Chen Han, was from Annam; there were no precious works of art in his tomb; but he worshiped Taoism, and some of the things may be related to the Taoism at that time. The discovery of such a large number of gold and silver utensils from the early Ming Dynasty is an important news. This proves once again that since the Six Dynasties, Sui and Tang Dynasties, the vicinity of Beijing was still a very prosperous city. If our excavation work continues, the entire history of Beijing can be written, and there can be various physical objects to prove it. As for the buildings of the Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, we have also discovered many in the suburbs of Beijing, and we are doing survey work. These should also be protected and repaired as much as possible. The buildings of the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties that have survived are not many and should all be protected; the buildings of the Ming Dynasty that have survived are still many (but gardens and residential houses are rarely seen), and the important ones should be protected; the buildings of the Qing Dynasty are everywhere and should be selected for their representativeness and cultural and historical value, and should be protected with emphasis.

    The suburbs of Beijing are still an "untouched" archaeological area, and we must devote all our efforts to investigation and excavation work. This is not something that a few government agencies and research institutions can do well by "fighting alone." It is hoped that all citizens of Beijing will cooperate and will tell us about the ancient sites, ancient tombs, and even antiquities they know, have seen, or have accidentally discovered at any time. We must rely on the power of the masses. We will display the ancient cultural relics discovered in the past in a scientific way, gradually expand the scale of the display, and enrich the Beijing History Museum. Let the citizens of the capital see the antiquities of the Spring and Autumn, Warring States, and Han Dynasties, know the long history of Beijing and its glorious achievements in culture and art, and understand the necessity of protecting them, and the necessity of systematically sorting out and studying them. Everyone has a responsibility to protect them, so that they are not in danger of being damaged. Loving the cultural and artistic heritage of the motherland is one of the obligations of the people of New China, and it is also one of the concrete manifestations of the people of New China loving the motherland.

    北京近郊文物的发掘与保护
     郑振铎
    北京是一个很古老的城市。如果追溯到远古时代，则中国猿人的发现地点——周口店就在围绕着北京的这个平原上。这中国猿人，学者们就定名为“北京人”。这是五十万年以前的住在今日的北京附近的原始人类。此后，住在这一代的原始人，如山顶洞人等，也陆续不绝地在创造他们的历史和文化，遗留下若干遗迹和工艺品，日用品等等。传说中的黄帝和蚩尤在涿鹿之野的大战就在这个平原上。有史以来，第一个比较可信的记载，是离今三千多年周武王封召公于北燕的事。此后，历代的封建主们都很活跃地在今日的北京附近活动着。离今一千年左右，辽太宗升幽州为南京。离今八百年前，金海陵王奠都燕京。北京城的正式历史当开始于这个时期。元以北京为大都，明永乐时，大规模地营建北京城，从南京迁都于此。今日北京城的规模，都还是永乐时代（公元一四○三、一四二四年）所规定下来的。现在式样的北京城，是有五百四五十年的历史了。
    无数年代的人民，在这个肥沃的平原上，生活着，斗争着，以他们的智慧和勤劳，创造了无数的生产工具，以及种种武器，和自然界作斗争，和封建主作斗争；创造了无数的艺术品，丰富了他们的生活。他们生于此，活动于此，歌舞于此，演出了无数的悲欢喜乐的动人的故事，他们死于此，葬于此。在荒烟蔓草中，埋藏了无数的人民和人民英雄乃至封建主；随同埋藏下去的是他们的心爱的艺术品，日用品，是人民创造的不朽的创作。经历了许多年代，偶然的在农人的耕犁下，发现了他们的墓坟和墓坟中所藏的文物。我们见到了那些文物，就仿佛见到那个时代的人物的生活和他们的活动情况。在这里，被掘出的是若干页已被遗忘的历史，是若干种被遗忘了的人民的智慧和勤劳所创作的艺术品。这是足令我们兴奋的，且能使我们发生亲切之感，使我们对于古老的祖先的创作和蕴藏着这许多的宝藏的祖国，发生无限的热爱。通过那些文物，不仅足以说明今天我们人民的首都北京的几十万年，几万年，几千年的历史和活动在这个肥沃的平原上的人民的“社会发展”的过程，且也足以说明整个中国的社会发展的过程。
    过去，没有人重视那些出土的文物；有好些人只是把他们当作了玩赏之物；没有人把他们和过去的社会生活联系起来，更不想去整理、研究他们；渐渐的，便遗忘了他们的出土地点和伴同出土的各种东西，把他们一件件的孤立起来看；完全失去了他们的应有的价值和其所含有的重要的意义。
    中央人民政府成立以来，颁布了关于发掘的法令，保护古文物、陵墓的法令，十分重视民族的文化、艺术遗产。不仅是消极的保护，还要有计划地有系统地从事于发掘工作，以期获得更多、更充足的资料，经过了整理、研究，公开地陈列出来，用以说明种种的问题，并用以表现中国的社会发展的历史。北京近郊的发掘工作，就是一个例子。
    在唐山市附近（唐山市虽非北京近郊，但也是在围绕着北京的这个平原上），我们曾经发现了类似李峪出土的若干铜器，和类似易县出土的许多砖瓦和其他陶器。这是有史时代的最早的北京附近所发见的文物。这可证明在春秋战国时代，北京附近曾经是一个人口很多的城市，且其文化程度是很高的。在北京东郊高碑店村和北郊清河镇朱房村，我们曾发现了若干汉墓。北京市人民政府、中央文物局和北京历史博物馆共同组织发掘队，在那些地方工作了一个时期，很得到些汉代的文物，主要的是陶俑，陶屋等。陶俑是用模子印制的，有点像四川彭山县出土的汉俑。这又可证明，在汉代，北京附近曾经也是人烟稠密的一个城市，那时所流行的艺术作风，和四川、中原是很相同的。
    丰台羊坊村有汉魏六朝迄隋唐的墓葬区，西山青龙桥、红山口一带是明代的墓葬区。丰台区我们还没有去工作，青龙桥区我们正在工作着——由中国科学院考古研究所和中央文物局合作——发见了很多有历史、艺术价值的文物。在那个区域里我们曾经发现过一座明武宗的一个妃子的坟墓；她死在嘉靖时候。坟里发现了她的凤冠和她的日用的东西，有黄金的戒指、臂镯、耳环、酒杯、水壶、水盘等等，有的是镀金的和银制的。制作的年代，有早到正德六年的。制作者有题着：“随驾御用监”，也有题着：“银作局”的。制作的技术很精工。我们还发现了若干明初的太监墓，有一个永乐时代的太监，名叫陈漌，是安南人；在他的墓里没有什么珍贵的艺术品；但他是崇拜道教的，有一部分东西，可能是和当时的道教有关的。这样大批的明代初期金银用具的发现，乃是一个重要的消息。这又可证明：六朝隋唐以来，北京附近仍是很繁盛的一个都市。我们的发掘工作如继续下去的话，北京的全部历史便可以写出来，且可以有种种的实物来证明。至于辽、金、元、明以及清代的建筑物，在北京近郊也被我们发见了不少，我们正在做着调查的工作。这也是应该尽量地设法保护、修整的。辽、金、元的建筑物，所存留的已经不多，应该全部加以保护；明代的建筑物，所存留的还多（但像庭园民居的已极少见），应该择其重要的加以保护；清代的建筑物，则到处皆是，应该选择其有代表性的，有文化、历史上的价值的，有重点地加以保护。
    北京近郊还是一个“处女地”似的考古地区，我们必须以全力从事于调查和发掘的工作。这不是几个政府机关、研究机构“孤军作战”所能够做好的。希望北京的全体市民能够合作，能够随时把他们所知的，所见的或所偶然发见的古迹、古坟墓以至古物告诉我们。我们必须依靠群众的力量。我们将把历次所发见的古代文物，用科学的方法陈列出来，逐渐发展陈列的规模，充实北京历史博物馆。使首都的市民见到了那些春秋、战国和汉代的古物，知道北京历史的悠久和它的文化、艺术的辉煌成就，明白其有保护的必要，有加以有系统地整理和研究的必要。人人有责任来保护它们，不令它们有遭受破坏的危险。爱祖国的文化、艺术的遗产，乃是新中国人民的义务之一，也就是新中国人民爱祖国的具体表现之一。（附图片）
