    Wasteful Phenomenon in the People's Government of the 16th District of Beijing
    Editor: There are formalism and waste in the work of the People's Government of the 16th District of Beijing, which should be corrected.
    Last winter, the district people's government used the profits from the production (coal mining) of the agency to purchase a car. After using it for a short time, it was stored in the workshop. It has been there for a year now, and no one has managed it, allowing the car to be damaged. There are many coal miners in this district, and they are distributed in various mining areas, and they urgently need a considerable number of toilets. However, this district only built two "model toilets" on the street, spending 20,000 catties of millet. If this money was used to build simpler toilets, it would be enough for all the workers in the district to use.
    The "model toilets" are also not managed, and they are very dirty, with sewage flowing out, and nearby residents are expressing dissatisfaction.
    I hope these things can attract the attention of relevant departments.

### 北京市第十六区人民政府有浪费现象

    北京市第十六区人民政府有浪费现象
    编辑同志：北京市第十六区人民政府工作中有形式主义和浪费的现象，应该纠正。
    去年冬季，区人民政府把机关生产（采煤）所得利润购买小汽车一辆，使用不久，就存放车间，到现在已经一年，一直没有人管理，任凭汽车损坏。这个区的煤矿工人很多，并且分布在各矿区，急需要相当数量的厕所。这个区却只在大街上修建了两个“模范厕所”，用去小米二万斤。如果把这笔费用修建比较简单的厕所，足够全区工人使用。
    “模范厕所”也没有人管理，弄得很肮脏，臭水往外流，附近居民都表示不满。
    我希望这些事能引起有关部门的注意。
                                 牛　虎
