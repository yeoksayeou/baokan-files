Editor's Note: The author of this article is an art worker who came from a military background. Before joining the Eighth Route Army, he worked as an apprentice, worker, and coolie. During the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, he created some comic strips that served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which were very popular among the masses. After entering the city, he was captured by the art ideology of the bourgeoisie, unilaterally emphasized technique, and seriously separated himself from politics and the masses. It was not until the current rectification study movement began that he suddenly woke up. Comrade Ren Qianqiao's self-criticism at the Central Academy of Fine Arts moved many art workers and promoted the study movement. We believe that such self-criticism is good, so we are publishing it for the reference of art workers in various places.

    In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, I was a soldier. In the combat life, I was inspired by propaganda posters, which made me even braver. Once, on the side of the road to the front line, we saw a huge cartoon with the title: "Warriors, are you willing to let the enemy trample on our land?" I was so moved that I shed tears. Farmers came to give us water to drink, and we said, "We'll drink it after we win the battle!" At that time, I thought: How great is the contribution of pictures to the Anti-Japanese War! I will study painting well in the future and use pictures to educate soldiers to bravely kill the enemy. From then on, I learned to paint whenever I had time. At first, I drew small comic strips on wall newspapers, and later I was able to draw propaganda posters on walls. At this time, the superiors prepared to send me to the Shandong Lu Xun Academy of Arts to study. I thought it would be better to stay in the army to fight and paint at the same time. Also, the war situation was very tense, so I did not go to the Lu Xun Academy of Arts to study.

    In 1944, I was sent to the countryside to participate in rent reduction and interest reduction work. The leading comrades explained to me the great political significance of this movement for the liberation of the masses and the support of the Anti-Japanese War. I felt the importance of the responsibility and gladly accepted the task. Through the grievances of the masses, I more deeply understood the inhumanity of the feudal system. Therefore, I decided to use my paintings to awaken the broad masses of peasants to fight against the feudal system. At that time, I lived with the work team. In the morning, I studied policies, and from after breakfast to before dinner, I mobilized and organized the masses. In the evening, I created comic strips, sometimes sleeping until midnight. When I drew about the oppression of the masses, my eyes were filled with tears, and I wiped them with my hands before continuing to draw. In this way, in less than twenty days, I created a set of fifty comic strips called "Emancipation." Before publication, in order to ensure that there were no problems, I posted all the paintings on the wall and asked the masses for their opinions. They all said: This comic book is very good. Many tenant farmers also asked me to draw a set for themselves. These masses also educated me: they not only pointed out the inappropriateness of the proportions, seasons, and clothing of the characters, but also offered many useful suggestions. One of the comic strips depicted a tenant farmer's woman being raped by a landlord. The woman ran to the rich man's door in resentment and died from poisoning. Her husband picked up the body, expressing anger and grief. The masses said: "This is not very appropriate, people will laugh when they see it." I accepted this valuable opinion and revised it.

    After the comic strip was published, it received good results. One soldier hated the landlords so much that he dug out the eyes of the landlords in each picture. A farmer who had previously been afraid to reason with the landlord, after reading this comic book, slapped the table and said: "I want to settle accounts with the landlord!" He later actively participated in the struggle.

    After that, I lived among the peasant masses for a long time, living, working, and fighting with the masses, thereby absorbing materials and creating. At that time, I knew: to create, I must understand the policies, otherwise, my works would have errors. Therefore, when I wanted to create a picture album, I always obtained policy books related to the creation from the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, or consulted the responsible comrades of relevant departments. They all helped me thoughtfully, giving me instructions from principles to specific issues, so that I had confidence in understanding the actual situation and absorbing images for creation.

    During these times, I knew very clearly: my creation was to serve the people, not for other purposes. When I was creating the "Emancipation" comic strip, a landlord who had studied at some art school said sarcastically: "Sir, which school does your painting belong to?" I replied: "I don't understand any schools, as long as it is beneficial to the masses!" In this way, under the cultivation and guidance of the Party, and with the encouragement and education of the masses, I created a total of seventeen comic strip albums. These albums were also well received by the masses. After the publication of the "Emancipation" comic strip, the Minister of Propaganda of the District Party Committee encouraged this creative direction in the newspaper. The "Hell on Earth" comic strip won a first-class literary and artistic prize.

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, a large number of new intellectuals entered the liberated areas. They also had two different evaluations of my works. Some comrades affirmed that my direction was correct and encouraged me to carry forward my past achievements and continue to move forward, and believed that technical problems could be solved in continuous creation and learning. Another group of people believed that although my works were popular among the masses, they could not be regarded as works of art. They said:
    "When the masses are hungry, chaff is also a good thing." "Comic strips are okay in the countryside, but in the city, they are the most despised thing. The revolution is about to win, and the big cities are about to be liberated. To be a true painter, you must be able to paint oil paintings." After hearing these words, I began to waver about my artistic career. I thought: I have been in the revolution for so many years, and I have accomplished "nothing," which made me very unhappy. Sometimes I thought: I might as well change careers, but after thinking about it, I couldn't bear to give it up. I went to consult a "painter" again and asked him if I could continue to work. He said: "To be honest, without five years of basic sketching, don't even think about creating." After hearing his words, I hardened my heart and made up my mind: I would not create for five years, and would focus on improving my technique. At that time, I had a struggle in my mind. I thought: In the past, the masses loved my works so much, and when they saw me, they were so affectionate. Can I abandon them? But I explained to myself: Improving my technique is also to better serve the people! So I shut myself in and painted plaster statues or carried a notebook and sketched everywhere, enthusiastically implementing other people's suggestions and looking for so-called "curvilinear beauty." I was unwilling to do the organizational work of the Fine Arts Association, and I was unwilling to study politics and policies. I was not interested in anything, and I thought that everything except improving my technique was an extra burden.

    In order to unilaterally pursue technique, I negated my past achievements. I wrote such comments on my past works: "Technically inferior, naive and ridiculous." It was as if these works were something disgraceful. In this way, I gradually separated myself from the masses and deviated from the correct path ideologically. During this period, some masses and comrades asked me: Why haven't you created anything in the past few years? Yao Dama, a model of supporting the army in Junan County, wrote to me and said: "Child, I haven't seen you for several years, you must have painted a lot of paintings, please send me a few to see!" This shows how much the masses hope that I will move forward on the right path. However, I did not adopt any of these opinions, and these words went in one ear and out the other. I thought: My main problem now is how to improve my technique, and I will not worry about anything else for the time being. Especially since entering the city, the thought of enjoyment has arisen, which has made me even more detached from the masses. Several times I wanted to go to the factory or the countryside, but I gave up because I was afraid of poor living conditions. Although I had been to the factory and the countryside several times, it was just a "trip" to see the flowers.

    In order to improve my technique, I was not at ease in my work and asked to leave my job to study technique full-time. The purpose of coming to the Central Academy of Fine Arts was to simply improve my technique. Therefore, after coming here, I was unwilling to take on any work other than learning technique. Whenever I was selected to take on any position, I always tried to shirk it. I was very active in drawing sketches, and even did not rest on Sundays. I felt great distress when I attended a two-hour meeting for the school's affairs.

    When others criticized me for having a purely technical viewpoint, I would say: "Improving technique is also preparing to serve the people!" In fact, my idea was the opposite. I thought that studying at the Central Academy of Fine Arts for two years may not achieve the goal of truly improving my technique. After studying for two years, I would ask to stay in Beijing to work. Because there are many talents in Beijing, I can continue to improve my technique. In this way, personal achievement will be greater. As for whether the things I have learned can well serve the people, I have not thought about it very well.

    These purely technical viewpoints and individualistic tendencies have only begun to waver recently. A few days ago, after watching the Soviet movie "Happy Life," I felt that Wu Ya had many similarities with me: due to complacency, not studying politics, and losing sensitivity to new things. I began to feel that if I insisted on mistakes, it would hinder my progress. Soon, the school held a current affairs test, and I failed. This incident gave me a great stimulus. I felt that I knew nothing, or only had a superficial understanding of these major events related to the country and all mankind. Isn't this backwardness? Later, after listening to the reports of Comrades Qiao Mu and Zhou Yang at the mobilization meeting for the literary and art circles in Beijing, I felt very ashamed. I felt that every sentence was pointed at me. Therefore, I recognized the seriousness of my wrong thoughts.

    I had once walked on the correct path, so why did I later go down the wrong path? This cannot be attributed to objective reasons. The main reason is that the petty-bourgeois individualistic thoughts have not been completely eliminated, and later they have made a comeback, and even developed. In my childhood, I was influenced by the old society. I was dissatisfied with the status quo of family life and fantasized that I could be promoted and become rich in the future, and glorify my ancestors. But the opposite was true. Not only did I not climb up, but I fell down. After hitting a snag, I was dissatisfied with the old society, and therefore I demanded revolution. That is to say: On the one hand, I participated in the revolution with a certain degree of awareness, but on the other hand, I also had some individualistic components. In the revolutionary ranks, I did not study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought well, and therefore did not overcome individualistic thoughts. When the interests of the revolution and the individual's requirements are consistent, I can also do some things that are beneficial to the people, without separating myself from politics and the people. When the interests of the revolution and individual interests conflict, this essence will be exposed. The past achievements are mainly the result of the Party and the people's education and encouragement to me. And I, at that time, was only satisfied with my own achievements, and did not strictly examine my thoughts, so that they developed to the current serious extent. Now I want to resolutely transform myself and bravely correct my mistakes. I know that technique should be learned, but only under the correct premise and with the correct method to learn, this learning is meaningful. I know that unilaterally emphasizing the importance of technique and separating myself from politics and the masses will certainly be spurned by the people, and as a result, it is impossible to truly learn technique.

    我走了弯路
    任迁乔
    编者按：本文作者是一位战士出身的美术工作者，参加八路军前曾作过学徒、工人、苦力。在抗日战争时期和解放战争时期，他创作了一些为工农兵服务的连环画，很受群众欢迎。进入城市以后，他被资产阶级的艺术思想所俘掳，片面强调技术，严重地脱离政治，脱离群众。直到此次整风学习运动开始以后，他才猛醒过来。任迁乔同志在中央美术学院作这个检讨的时候，感动了许多美术工作者，推动了学习运动。我们认为这样的检讨是好的，所以刊登出来，给各地美术工作者参考。
    抗战初期的时候，我是一个战士，在战斗生活里，受到宣传画的鼓动，使我更加勇敢。有一次，我们在开赴前线的路旁，看到一张巨幅的漫画，标题是：“勇士们，你甘心让敌人蹂躏我们的国土吗？”我被感动得流下泪来，农民来送水给我们喝，我们说：“打了胜仗再喝！”当时我想：图画对抗战的贡献多么大啊！我将来要好好地学画，用图画教育战士勇敢杀敌。从此以后，我有空就学画。起先是在墙报上画些小连环画，后来也能在墙壁上画宣传画了。这时上级准备送我到山东鲁迅艺术学院学习，我想，还是留在部队上一面作战一面作画好一些，同时战争情况也很紧张，所以没有去鲁迅艺术学院学习。
    一九四四年，我被派到乡下去参加减租减息工作，领导同志向我说明了这个运动对群众的解放和支援抗日战争的伟大政治意义，我感到责任的重大，愉快地接受了这个任务。通过群众诉苦，使我更深刻地了解到封建制度的惨无人道，因此我决定，要用我的图画唤起广大农民，向封建制度作斗争。那时我和工作队在一起生活，早上学习政策，早饭后到晚饭前就动员组织群众，晚上创作连环画，有时直到半夜才睡。画到群众受压迫的时候，眼睛含着泪水，用手擦擦再画。就这样不到二十天的工夫，创作了一册五十幅的连环画，名字叫“翻身”。出版以前，为了使它不出毛病，我把所有的画幅贴在墙上请群众提意见，他们都说：这画本很好。许多佃农还要求我给他自己画一套。这些群众同时也教育了我：他们不仅指出人物的比例、季节和服装的不恰当之处，而且提出许多有益的意见。这套连环画有一幅描写佃户的女人被地主强奸，这个女人愤恨地跑到财主的门口服毒而死，她的丈夫把尸体抱起来，表示愤恨和悲痛。群众说：“这样不大合适，人家看了会笑。”我接受了这个宝贵意见，把它修改了。
    这册连环画发行以后，收到很好的效果。有个战士恨得把每幅画上的地主的眼睛挖了去。有一个农民开始不敢和地主讲理，看了这本连环画后，拍了一下桌子说：“我要和地主算账！”他以后积极地参加了斗争。
    以后我就长时期生活在农民群众中，和群众一起生活，劳动和战斗，从而吸取材料，进行创作。那时我知道：要创作必须了解政策，不然，我的作品就会发生错误。因此，当我要创作一本画册的时候，总要向区党委宣传部取得和创作有关的政策书籍，或者请教有关部门的负责同志。他们都很周到地帮助我，从原则到具体问题，给我指示，使我在了解实际情况和吸取形象进行创作时有了把握。
    这些时候，我很明确地知道：我的创作是为人民服务的，而不是为了其它目的。我在创作“翻身”连环画的时候，有个曾在一个什么艺术学校学习过的地主，用讽刺的口吻说：“先生，你的画算是那
    一派呢？”我回答说：“我不懂得什么派别，只要对群众有好处就成了！”就这样，我在党的培养和指导下，在群众的鼓励、教育下，前后共创作了十七本连环画册。这些画册也得到了群众的好评。“翻身”连环画出版后区党委宣传部长曾在报纸上鼓励这种创作方向。“人间地狱”连环画曾得到一等文艺奖金。
    抗战胜利后，大批新的知识分子进入解放区，他们对我的作品也有两种不同的评价，有些同志肯定我的方向是正确的，并鼓励我发扬以往的成绩，继续前进，并认为技术问题在不断的创作和学习中可以得到解决。另外一部分人认为：我的作品虽然受群众欢迎，但不能作为艺术作品看待。他们说：
    “当群众饿着肚子的时候，粗糠也是好东西。”“连环画在农村是可以的，但在都市里是最使人看不起的一种东西。革命眼看要胜利了，大城市眼看就要解放，要作一个名符其实的画家，非会画油画不可。”我听了这些话以后，开始对我的艺术事业动摇了。我想：我革命这些年，弄了个“一事无成”，很不高兴。有时想：不如改行算了，但想来想去还是舍不得丢开它。我又去请教一位“画家”，问他我是否还能继续工作下去？他说：“老实告诉你，没有五年的素描基础，就别想创作。”我听了他的话以后，狠狠心，拿定主意：五年之内不创作，专门提高技术。当时我思想上曾作过一番斗争。我想：过去群众对我的作品是那样的热爱，当他们看见我的时候，又是那样的亲热。我能抛弃他们吗？可是我又为自己解释：我提高技术也是为了更好地为人民服务啊！于是我就关着门画石膏像或挟着本子到处乱画速写，热心执行别人的建议，寻找所谓“曲线美”。我既不愿意作美术协会的组织工作，也不愿意学习政治和政策，对一切事物都不发生兴趣，认为除了提高技术之外，别的事情都是额外的负担。
    为了片面追求技术，把过去的成绩否定了。我曾把我过去的作品写上这样的评语：“技术低劣，幼稚可笑。”好像这些作品是一些不光彩的东西。就是这样从思想上逐渐脱离群众，脱离了正确的道路。这时期，有些群众和同志都问我：这几年为什么不创作了呢？莒南县拥军模范姚大娘写信给我说：“孩子，几年不见了，你一定画了很多的画，你给我捎几张来看看吧！”这说明群众多么希望我在正道上前进。但是，这些意见我一点没有采纳，这些话成了耳边风。我想：我现在的主要问题是如何提高技术，别的暂时不管它。特别是自从进入城市以后，产生了享乐思想，使我更加脱离群众。几次想下工厂或者下农村，都因怕生活条件不好而作罢。虽然曾经到过工厂和农村几次，但不过是走马观花地“旅行”一趟而已。
    为了提高技术，我就不安心工作，要求离开工作专门学习技术。来中央美术学院的目的，就是为了想单纯提高技术。因此，来此以后，除学习技术之外什么工作都不愿担任。选我担任什么职务，总想办法推诿。画素描很积极，甚至星期日都不休息。为了全校的事情参加两小时的会，却感到很大的苦恼。
    别人批评我有单纯的技术观点，我就会说：“提高技术也是准备为人民服务！”其实我的想法是相反的。我想，在中央美术学院学习二年，不一定能达到真正提高技术的目的，学了二年以后，要求留在北京工作。因为北京的人材多，可以继续提高技术。这样，个人成就就更大。至于学习到的东西是不是能够很好地为人民服务，我却没有很好去想。
    这些纯技术观点和个人主义倾向，到最近才开始动摇。前些日子看苏联电影“幸福的生活”，我觉得吴雅这个人有很多地方和我相像：由于自满自足，不学习政治而失去了对新鲜事物的敏感。我开始觉得：如果坚持错误，就会阻碍自己的进步。不久，学校举行了一次时事测验，我没有及格。这件事给了我很大的刺激。我觉得这些有关国家和全人类的大事，我竟一无所知，或者是一知半解，这不是落后是什么呢？后来听了乔木和周扬等同志在北京文艺界学习动员大会上的报告，心里非常惭愧，我觉得每句话都是指着我说的。因此我认识了自己错误思想的严重性。
    我曾经走过正确的道路，为什么后来又走入错误的道路呢？这不能推到客观原因。主要由于小资产阶级的个人主义思想没有彻底清除，在后来就死灰复燃，甚至发展起来。我在少年时代，受了旧社会的影响，不满家庭生活的现状，幻想将来也能升官发财，光宗耀祖。但事实相反，不但没有爬上去，反而掉下来。碰了钉子之后，对旧社会不满意，因而又要求革命。这就是说：我参加革命一方面有一定的觉悟，另一方面却也多少带有个人主义的成分。在革命队伍中，没有很好地学习马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，因而没有克服个人主义思想。当革命利益和个人的要求一致的时候，也可以作出一些有益于人民的事，没有脱离政治，没有脱离人民。当革命利益和个人利益相矛盾的时候，这种本质就原形毕露了。过去的成绩，主要是党和人民对我的教育、鼓励的结果。而我呢，当时只满足自己的成绩，而没有去严格地检查思想，以至使它发展到现在的严重程度。现在我要坚决改造自己，勇敢地改正错误。我知道技术是应当学习的，但是只有在正确的前提下，用正确的方法去学习，这种学习才是有意义的。我知道，片面强调技术的重要性而脱离政治，脱离群众，一定会被人民唾弃，结果也不可能真正学到技术。（原载“文艺报”五卷五期）
