    CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee Holds Meeting of Enterprise Cadres to Mobilize Continued Implementation of the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Struggle

    The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of various factories and enterprises on the 19th of last month to mobilize the continued implementation and development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. At the meeting, Xue Guangjun, Deputy Director of the Industrial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, reported on the situation and existing problems in the anti-corruption, anti-degeneration, anti-extravagance, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Shenyang's factories and enterprises over the past month. He pointed out that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Shenyang's factories and enterprises was a step behind that of the government organs; with the exception of a few factories, most factories have not yet taken action.

    Xue Guangjun pointed out that the ideological situation of the leadership in these factories that have not yet taken action can be divided into the following types: Some are afraid of implementing this movement because they themselves have serious problems, and therefore try to "delay" it or deal with it perfunctorily. For example, the director of a certain factory is unwilling to even look at the opinions raised by the masses. Some have complacency and think that their work is already "almost there" and have been praised, so there is nothing to "rectify"; therefore, they use the excuse of being too busy to conduct serious inspections. Some lack the spirit of self-criticism and one-sidedly emphasize the need to raise "constructive" opinions or "grasp the key" issues, making it unclear to the masses whether their opinions are considered "key" issues, and they dare not raise them, which is a disguised form of suppressing democracy. Others have no idea what problems need to be solved in their factories during the movement, and only make general self-examinations; therefore, they cannot concentrate their efforts on solving the main problems and cannot combine it with improving current work. Due to the lack of self-criticism on the part of the leadership, most middle-level cadres (section chiefs, site directors) adopt a laissez-faire attitude and are indifferent to this movement. In addition, some Party branches unconditionally accommodate the shortcomings of the administrative leadership and cannot seriously wield the weapon of criticism and self-criticism.

    Then, Xue Guangjun emphatically pointed out that the implementation of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is a major political task, and leading cadres of all factories and enterprises must attach great importance to it; and the following points must be achieved: First, make all employees clearly realize that corruption and waste are shameful, and bureaucratic work style is harmful, violating the interests of the state and the people. Second, eliminate corruption, oppose extravagance and waste, criticize bureaucratic work styles, and strengthen the viewpoint of relying on the working class. Third, solve the long-term unresolved problems in production. Fourth, the opinions raised by employees (regarding production, labor insurance, welfare, etc.) should be resolved as much as possible if they can be resolved; if they cannot be resolved immediately, plans should be made to gradually resolve them within a certain period; and if they cannot be resolved, the employees should be given explanations. Fifth, establish and improve various necessary systems.

    After Xue Guangjun's report, Guan Zhanxian, Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Third Clothing Factory, introduced the factory's gains and experiences in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Since the factory exposed corrupt and bribery-taking elements, the production enthusiasm of the employees has increased. The tailoring workshop originally planned to increase production and save a net profit of seventeen tons of grain in October (one month), but the result reached thirty-seven tons. The whole factory exceeded the plan for increasing production and saving by 94.1 percent in October.

### 中共沈阳市委召开企业干部会议  动员继续贯彻反贪污浪费斗争

    中共沈阳市委召开企业干部会议
    动员继续贯彻反贪污浪费斗争
    中共沈阳市委员会于上月十九日召开各工厂、各企业的党、行政、工会、青年团负责干部会议，动员继续贯彻开展反贪污浪费、反官僚主义斗争。会上，中共沈阳市委工业部副部长薛光军报告了沈阳市各工厂、企业一个月来开展反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况及存在的问题。他指出：沈阳市工厂、企业开展反贪污蜕化、反铺张浪费、反官僚主义运动，比机关迟了一步；除了少数工厂外，多数工厂至今尚未行动起来。
    薛光军指出：这些尚未行动起来的工厂领导方面的思想情况，可分为以下几种：有的是由于本身有严重问题，因此害怕贯彻这一运动，企图“拖”过去，或马马虎虎应付一下。如某厂厂长对群众提的意见连看都不愿看一下。有的是有自满情绪，认为工作已经“差不多”，已受到表扬，没有什么“风”可整了；因此藉口工作太忙，不认真进行检查。有的是缺乏自我批评精神，片面地强调要提“建设性”意见或“抓住关键”的问题，使群众弄不清自己的意见究竟是否算“关键”问题而不敢提意见，这是变相的压制民主。有的则是对本厂在运动中要解决那些问题，心中无数，只是泛泛地检讨；因而不能集中力量解决主要问题，不能和改进当前工作结合起来。由于领导方面缺乏自我批评精神，使一般中级干部（科长、现场主任）采取自由主义态度，对这一运动漠不关心。此外还有些支部对行政领导方面的缺点无原则地迁就，不能严肃地掌握批评与自我批评的武器。
    接着薛光军着重地指出：贯彻反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动是一个重大的政治任务，各工厂、企业的领导干部必须予以充分重视；而且要作到以下几点：一、使全体职工明确认识贪污浪费是可耻的，官僚主义作风是有害的，是违反国家与人民利益的。二、肃清贪污腐化现象，反对铺张浪费，批判官僚主义作风，加强依靠工人阶级的观点。三、解决生产中长期拖延不能解决的问题。四、对职工提出的意见（关于生产、劳动保险、福利等），能解决的应尽量予以解决；不能马上解决的，要订出计划，在一定时期内逐步解决；对不可能解决的应向职工进行解释。五、建立与健全各种必要的制度。
    薛光军报告后，被服三厂党总支书记关占先介绍了该厂在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中的收获与经验。该厂自检举了贪污受贿分子后，职工生产热情提高，裁剪车间十月份（一个月）原订增产节约纯利益十七吨粮食，结果达到三十七吨。全厂十月份超过增产节约计划百分之九十四点一。
