    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 24th: The Sendai High Court in Japan was forced on the 20th to decide to retry the so-called "Matsukawa Incident." This is a preliminary victory achieved by all twenty innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" after nearly two months of heroic court struggle with the support of the Japanese people and the people of the world.
    Since the Fukushima District Court unreasonably sentenced the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" to death and long-term imprisonment on December 6 last year, the defendants have appealed to the Sendai High Court, requesting the revocation of the judgment and the restoration of their freedom. The Sendai High Court opened a hearing on their appeal on October 23. During the appeal, the defendants and their defense lawyers waged a heroic struggle in prison and in court, ruthlessly exposing the prosecuting authorities' fabricated "charges."
    At the same time, the Japanese people also launched various forms of struggle to rescue the innocent defendants. They launched a campaign to raise one million yen in relief funds and a million-signature campaign demanding the release of the defendants. The people of the world also extended a helping hand to the persecuted Japanese patriots. Many trade union organizations, led by the World Federation of Trade Unions, have expressed their support for the just struggle of the "Matsukawa Incident" defendants. Workers and other people from China, Romania, Bulgaria, India, and other countries have sent many letters and telegrams of protest to the Japanese authorities. Under the pressure of the Japanese people and the people of the world, the Sendai High Court has now been forced to decide to retry the "Matsukawa Incident." However, until it declares all innocent defendants not guilty, the Japanese people and the people of the world, who are deeply concerned about the innocent defendants, will undoubtedly continue to provide strong support to these Japanese patriots.

    日本和世界人民积极声援日本爱国者仙台裁判所被迫决定重审“松川事件”
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：日本仙台高等裁判所已在二十日被迫决定重审所谓“松川事件”。这是“松川事件”全体二十名无辜被告在日本人民和世界人民的支援下，英勇地进行将近两个月的法庭斗争后所取得的初步胜利。
    自从去年十二月六日福岛地方裁判所对“松川事件”无辜被告无理地分别判处死刑和长期徒刑后，被告即向仙台高等裁判所提出上诉，要求撤销这一判决，恢复他们的自由。仙台高等裁判所在十月二十三日开庭处理他们的上诉。在上诉期间，被告和他们的辩护律师在监狱中、在法庭上进行了英勇的斗争，无情地揭穿检察当局的伪造“罪状”。
    与此同时，日本人民也展开了各种方式的斗争来援救无辜被告。他们发动了募集一百万日元救援基金运动和要求释放被告的一百万人签名运动。世界人民也向遭受迫害的日本爱国者伸出了支援之手。以世界工会联合会为首的许多工会组织，纷纷表示支援“松川事件”被告的正义斗争。中国、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和印度等国的工人和其他阶层的人民，都向日本当局发出了许多抗议的函电。在日本人民和世界人民的压力下，仙台高等裁判所现已被迫决定重审“松川事件”，但是，在它没有宣告全体无辜被告无罪以前，深切关怀无辜被告的日本人民和世界人民，无疑将会继续给这些日本爱国者以有力的支援。
