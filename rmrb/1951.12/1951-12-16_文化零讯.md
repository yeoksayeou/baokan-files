Cultural Snippets

　　▲ Winter schools in most areas of Henan Province have started in early December. More than 3 million farmers are attending winter schools.

　　Various regions in Henan Province made full preparations before the opening of the rural winter schools. All special districts and counties held short-term training courses for winter school teachers, training more than 60,000 winter school teachers throughout the province. Many of them were learning models and active members in farmers' spare-time schools. When training winter school teachers, various regions also summarized the experience of combining past winter school teaching work with local central tasks, and required that this year's winter school movement achieve "no delay in learning, work, and production."

　　This year, Henan Province's winter schools will strengthen political and current affairs education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and increasing production and practicing economy. The Cultural and Educational Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government has compiled winter school political teaching materials, which are published in the Henan Mass Daily. In order to carry out the winter school movement on a large scale, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Cultural and Educational Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government have jointly formed three winter school work teams to assist the local winter school work in key areas. Each special district and county has also selected key areas to cultivate typical examples, create experience, and promote them in a timely manner.

　　▲ The Shanghai Municipal People's Government streamlined internal publications and decided to issue only one type of internal mimeographed publication, the "Shanghai Municipal Gazette." Publications distributed externally will all be enterprise-based, with subsidies or disguised subsidies being canceled.

　　Before July of this year, the units under the Shanghai Municipal People's Government compiled and published more than 240 kinds of books and periodicals. According to preliminary statistics from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, from liberation to March of this year, in nearly two years, the expenses for compiling and printing internal books and periodicals by units under the Shanghai Municipal People's Government reached more than 30 billion yuan. In July of this year, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government conducted a preliminary review of publications from all levels of organs under its jurisdiction, reducing the number to only 16 types. Recently, it was further decided that the entire municipal-level organ would only issue one type of internal mimeographed publication. Public publications distributed externally will all be enterprise-based; those that cannot be enterprise-based will be discontinued.
