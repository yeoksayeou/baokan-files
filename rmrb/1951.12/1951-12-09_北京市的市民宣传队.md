    Beijing's Citizen Propaganda Teams
    By the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    I.

    In April of this year, during the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, focusing on the Fourth District of Beijing and taking the police station as the unit, experimented with establishing mass-based citizen propaganda teams. Based on the experience gained, such propaganda teams were established successively in various districts within the city after May. Currently, except for the Second District, which only has citizen propaganda teams established in two police stations, the remaining districts have universally established them. The city now has a total of 139 citizen propaganda teams with 6,826 members.

    Citizen propaganda teams were established on the basis of the organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Democratic Women's Federation, cultural and educational organizations, health organizations, housing repair committees, and fire brigades. Propaganda team members were selected from these mass organizations and active participants in the work of the police stations. The criteria for selecting these members were: (1) politically reliable, supporting the Party and the People's Government; (2) having propaganda ability and willing to do propaganda work; (3) having a decent work style and good relations with the masses. The districts generally were cautious when selecting members, conducting careful research with the police stations and various mass organizations, with the police stations responsible for the review. Consideration was also given to ensuring that each hutong had a certain number of propaganda team members, who must be representative and have connections with various strata of the masses, enabling them to go deep into all levels of the population to conduct propaganda. In the process of establishing citizen propaganda teams, in order to enable the masses to consciously and voluntarily participate in this work, sufficient deliberation and mobilization were first carried out among the activists, and the significance and tasks of establishing propaganda teams were explained to them.

    The organization of the propaganda team is as follows: propaganda team members from each police station form a large team, divided into groups or detachments according to one or several hutongs. Propaganda team members in each hutong are mainly responsible for conducting propaganda to the masses in their own hutong or courtyard. The propaganda team is under the leadership of the Resist America, Aid Korea branch in each section, with the Party providing political and ideological leadership through its organization's propaganda officers and Party members serving as police station chiefs. Some organization propaganda officers and police station chiefs participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea branch as members or directors/vice-directors, or are hired by the Resist America, Aid Korea branch as instructors for the propaganda team. Organization propaganda officers and Party members serving as police station chiefs are uniformly under the leadership of the district Party committee's propaganda department.

    II.

    After the establishment of the citizen propaganda teams, the face of propaganda work changed. In the past, our propaganda work for the citizens was not frequent or universal, because the Party's street branch was weak. Propaganda to the citizens mainly relied on students and cadres, and therefore could only be carried out in a concentrated manner during large movements, making it difficult to make it a regular activity, let alone be popularized and deeply rooted in every household and individual. Once the citizen propaganda teams were established, we had a force that we could rely on and use regularly: First, it made propaganda work gradually regular. For example, since April, citizen propaganda teams have conducted propaganda on major current events, policies, and work tasks such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the three major calls of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch, the Korean armistice talks, and the Marriage Law. Second, it gradually popularized and deepened citizen propaganda work. During the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda movement in April, more than 90% of the masses received propaganda, basically eliminating the blank areas in propaganda work; because every hutong had propaganda team members who adopted a door-to-door visiting approach, the scope of propaganda was greatly expanded. Because propaganda team members are familiar with the lives of the masses and understand the situation, they are good at targeting the masses' ideological situation and using popular language to conduct propaganda, making the propaganda work more effective.

    Over the past few months, the work of the citizen propaganda teams has achieved great results, raising the awareness of the masses, implementing the policies of the Party and the People's Government among the masses, promoting various tasks, strengthening the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, and making the masses increasingly close and united. Many people who did not understand the reasons for resisting America and aiding Korea now understand; reactionary rumors have lost their market among the masses and are not easily spread; many women who used to stay at home all the time are now coming out to participate in social and political activities. During the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in April, the number of people who signed and voted reached more than 90% of the city's total population; nearly 900,000 citizens signed patriotic covenants. Many hutongs and large courtyards that were backward and disunited in the past have now become progressive, united families. This is even more evident in the donation work, such as in Xiaoshaguo Hutong in the Second District. After the three major calls of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch were issued, propaganda team members continued to conduct propaganda. When the donation work began, the masses pledged to donate 4.01 million yuan within two or three days, and by the beginning of November, they had paid 4.78 million yuan ahead of schedule and in excess. Other tasks such as supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, preventing spies, preventing theft, preventing fire, and cleaning and sanitation have all been better done than before as a result of the activities of propaganda team members.

    Propaganda team members not only do propaganda work, but also frequently report social and mass situations to the police station, enabling the Party and the People's Government to better understand the needs of the masses. Many police station chiefs said: "The masses' awareness has been raised, there are more activists, and the work is easier to do." Backward masses who used to satirize and ridicule activists have now changed their attitudes and are very respectful and affectionate towards activists, and some even help activists who are busy with work take care of household affairs. Activists are therefore more motivated to work.

    III.

    Citizen propaganda team members generally adopt methods such as home visits, convening small gatherings, reading newspapers, holding exhibitions and explaining pictures, organizing listening to the radio, and running blackboards for propaganda. Because the cultural level of propaganda team members is generally not high, and the targets of propaganda are mostly working people and housewives, many of whom are illiterate, citizen propaganda teams mainly rely on oral propaganda. Propaganda team members of the Ninth Police Station in the Second District created the activity mode of "Resist America, Aid Korea Day." Resist America, Aid Korea Day is a weekly gathering held on a regular basis with the hutong as the unit, at which propaganda team members or invited specialists explain current events, policies, and work tasks, review patriotic covenants, and conduct commendations and criticisms, and sometimes there are cultural and entertainment activities. The advantages of this method are: (1) As long as the meeting is well held and the masses participate in "Resist America, Aid Korea Day" as a conscious habit, propaganda work can be regularized. (2) The propaganda activities of various mass organizations and the propaganda of various work tasks can be concentrated on "Resist America, Aid Korea Day," which can not only unify the pace and make propaganda work more planned, but also save time and reduce the phenomenon of too many meetings for activists and the masses. In addition to the Second District, other districts are also promoting the propaganda method of "Resist America, Aid Korea Day."

    In addition, some police stations, with the help of cultural centers, have established cultural stations relying on the strength of the masses. Although the activities of cultural stations have not yet been greatly developed and there are few books and periodicals in the cultural stations, this is a noteworthy task. Because the cultural station can become a stronghold for citizen propaganda teams' activities. Doing a good job in the work of cultural stations will greatly help citizen propaganda work. We plan to find one or two key points for experimentation in the future to learn from experience.

    IV.

    Based on the work of citizen propaganda teams in this stage, we have gained the following experiences:

    1. In cities with concentrated residents, forming citizen propaganda teams by district is an appropriate organizational form for regularly conducting propaganda to the vast number of citizens, a way for leading organs to cultivate and educate mass activists, the main reliance for regularizing urban mass propaganda work, and the core organization for further deepening patriotic education to urban residents. Establishing such citizen propaganda teams in cities is needed for mass propaganda work, and it is also conditional and possible to achieve.

    2. To consolidate and persist in the work of citizen propaganda teams, it is first necessary to strengthen the leadership of citizen propaganda teams. To this end, in addition to the district Party committee's propaganda department providing regular and specific leadership to the citizen propaganda teams, it is also necessary to fully use the power of the organization's propaganda officers and police stations. The branches of each organization should, according to the specific situation and conditions of their own units, assign a portion of the organization's propaganda officers to guide the work of the citizen propaganda teams in a fixed area under the direct leadership of the district Party committee, explaining current events, policies, and current central tasks to citizen propaganda team members once a week or every two weeks; the police station is the government organ that is most closely in contact with the masses and has prestige among the residents, so the police stations in each district should provide specific assistance and leadership to the citizen propaganda teams, and the public security sub-bureau should attach importance to this work. Facts have proven that after the police station leaders participate in the propaganda work of the masses, they can make security work and all other work better and gain the support and assistance of the broad masses.

    3. The district Party committee's propaganda department should always pay attention to improving the political and ideological level of citizen propaganda team members, regularly carry out education on ideological work style, working methods, and basic political common sense, regularly provide propaganda materials, cultivate typical examples and key members, and establish a leadership system.

    4. We should always pay attention to rectifying and consolidating the ranks. The composition of citizen propaganda team members is relatively complex, and some team members also hold too many concurrent positions, are too busy with work, and have a large degree of mobility. Therefore, the Party's propaganda department should continuously rectify the citizen propaganda teams, absorb new activists to participate; adjust concurrent positions, regularly check work progress, and immediately correct any shortcomings and deviations that are discovered.

    5. The work of citizen propaganda teams must be coordinated with the propaganda work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Democratic Women's Federation, and cultural centers. The Party committee should provide unified leadership so that these propaganda forces can divide their labor and cooperate, each giving full play to their strengths.

    6. Citizen propaganda team members are all masses who do not leave production, and the leading organs must take care of their production and life, do not assign too many tasks, so that they are exhausted; and should regularly give appropriate praise and encouragement to improve their work enthusiasm.

    北京市的市民宣传队
    中共北京市委宣传部
    一
    今年四月，在普及和深入抗美援朝运动中，中共北京市委宣传部以北京市第四区为重点，以派出所为单位，试验建立群众性的市民宣传队。根据所得的经验，五月以后在城内各区陆续建立了这种宣传队。现在除第二区还只有两个派出所建立了市民宣传队以外，其余各区都已普遍建立起来了。全市现在共有市民宣传队一百三十九个，队员六千八百二十六人。
    市民宣传队是在中苏友好协会组织、民主妇女联合会组织、文教组织、卫生组织、房屋修缮委员会、防火队的基础上建立的，宣传队员就是从这些群众组织和参加派出所工作的群众积极分子中挑选出来的。我们选择这些队员的条件是：（一）政治上可靠，拥护党和人民政府；（二）有宣传能力，愿意作宣传工作；（三）作风正派，和群众关系较好。各区选择队员时一般很慎重，大都同派出所和各群众组织作了审慎研究，并由派出所负责作了审查。同时也考虑到使每个胡同都有一定数量的宣传队员，队员必须具有代表性，和各阶层群众有联系，能深入各阶层群众中去进行宣传。在建立市民宣传队的过程中，为了使群众能够自觉自愿地参加这一工作，首先在积极分子中进行了充分的酝酿和动员，并把建立宣传队的意义和任务给他们作了讲解。
    宣传队的组织是：每个派出所的宣传队员组成为一个大队，按一个胡同或几个胡同划分为小组或分队。每个胡同的宣传队员主要负责向本胡同或本院子的群众进行宣传。宣传队受各段抗美援朝支会的领导，党通过机关宣传员和担任派出所长职务的党员进行政治思想领导。有的机关宣传员和派出所长参加抗美援朝支会为委员或正副主任，或由抗美援朝支会聘为宣传队的指导员。机关宣传员和担任派出所长职务的党员统一受区委宣传部领导。
    二市民宣传队建立以后，改变了宣传工作的面貌。过去我们对市民的宣传工作是作得不经常、不普遍的，因为党的街道支部力量很弱，对市民进行宣传，主要是依靠学生和干部，因此只能在大的运动中突击一阵，很难作到经常化，更不可能普及深入到每一户每一人。市民宣传队一经建立，我们就有了可以经常依靠和使用的力量：第一，使宣传工作逐渐经常化。如从四月以来，市民宣传队进行了关于镇压反革命、抗美援朝总会三大号召、朝鲜停战谈判、婚姻法……等重大的时事、政策和工作任务的宣传。第二，使市民宣传工作逐渐普及深入。在今年四月间的抗美援朝宣传运动中，百分之九十以上的群众都受到了宣传，基本上消灭了宣传工作的空白区；由于每个胡同都有宣传队员，并采取挨户访问的方式，宣传面是大大地扩大了。由于宣传队员熟悉群众的生活，了解情况，因而善于针对群众的思想情况，用通俗的群众的语言进行宣传，使宣传工作收效更大。
    几个月来，市民宣传队的工作有很大的成绩，提高了群众的觉悟，把党和人民政府的政策贯彻到群众中去，推动了各项工作，密切了党和人民政府同群众的关系，并使群众日益亲密团结。许多人原来不明白抗美援朝的道理的，现在懂得了；反动谣言在群众中失去了市场，不容易传播了；过去许多大门不出二门不迈的妇女，现在都出来参加社会活动和政治活动了。在四月份普及深入抗美援朝运动中，签名、投票的人数达全市总人口的百分之九十以上；市民订立爱国公约的人数近九十万人。许多过去落后和不团结的胡同和大杂院，现在都变成了进步、团结的大家庭了。在捐献工作上表现得更明显，如二区小沙果胡同，在抗美援朝总会三大号召发出以后，宣传队员就不断进行宣传，到捐献工作开始时，群众在两三天内就认捐了四百零一万元，到十一月初即提前超额交纳了四百七十八万元。其他工作如拥军优抚、防特务、防盗、防火、清洁卫生等工作由于宣传队员活动的结果，都比以前好作了。
    宣传队员不单做宣传工作，还经常向派出所反映社会和群众的情况，使党和人民政府更能了解群众的要求。许多派出所所长说：“群众觉悟提高了，积极分子也多了，工作好做了。”过去讽刺、嘲笑积极分子的落后群众，现在也改变了态度，对积极分子很尊敬、很亲热，有的还帮助工作忙的积极分子料理家事。积极分子因此工作劲头更大了。
    三市民宣传队的队员一般采取家庭访问、开片儿会、读报、举办展览和讲解图片、组织收听广播、办黑板报等方式进行宣传。由于宣传队员文化水平一般都不高，同时宣传的对象大都是劳动人民和家庭妇女，不识字的居多，因此市民宣传队以口头宣传为主。第二区第九派出所的宣传队员创造了“抗美援朝日”的活动方式。抗美援朝日即是以胡同为单位，每周定期举行集会一次，在会上由宣传队员或请专人讲解时事、政策和工作任务，检查爱国公约，进行表扬批评，有时并有文化娱乐活动。这种方式的优点是：（一）只要把会开好，使群众参加“抗美援朝日”成为一种自觉的习惯，就能使宣传工作经常化。（二）可以把各种群众组织的宣传活动和对各种工作任务的宣传都集中在“抗美援朝日”来进行，这一方面既可统一步调，使宣传工作更有计划，一方面又可节省时间，减少积极分子和群众开会过多的现象。除第二区以外，现在各区也正在推广“抗美援朝日”的宣传方式。
    此外有的派出所在文化馆的帮助下，依靠群众力量建立了文化站。目前文化站的活动虽然还没有很大的开展，文化站的书籍、报刊还很少，但这是值得注意的工作。因为文化站可以成为市民宣传队的一个活动据点。把文化站的工作做好了，对市民宣传工作将有很大的帮助。我们今后拟找一两个重点作试验，以吸取经验。四
    根据这一阶段市民宣传队工作的情况，我们得到下列几点经验：
    一、在居民集中的城市里，以地段为单位组成市民宣传队，是对广大市民经常进行宣传的一种适当的组织形式，是领导机关培养和教育群众积极分子的一种方式，是城市群众宣传工作经常化的主要依靠，是进一步深入向城市居民进行爱国主义教育的核心组织。在城市中建立这种市民宣传队是群众宣传工作所需要的，也是有条件和可能作到的。
    二、要把市民宣传队的工作巩固起来、坚持下去，首先要加强对市民宣传队的领导。为此，除各区区委宣传部要对市民宣传队加以经常、具体的领导以外，还应当充分使用机关宣传员和派出所的力量。各机关支部应根据本单位的具体情况和条件，分出一部分机关宣传员，在区委直接领导下，固定在一个地区指导市民宣传队的工作，每周或每两周给市民宣传队员讲解一次时事、政策和当前的中心任务；派出所是和群众接触最密切的政府机关，它在居民群众中是有威信的，因此各区派出所应给市民宣传队以具体帮助和领导，公安分局应重视这个工作。事实证明，派出所领导和参加了群众的宣传工作之后，就可使治安工作和其他一切工作做得更好，取得广大群众的拥护与协助。
    三、区委宣传部要经常注意提高市民宣传队员的政治思想水平，经常进行思想作风的教育、工作方法和基本政治常识的教育，经常供给宣传材料，培养典型和骨干分子，建立领导的制度。
    四、应经常注意整顿和巩固队伍。市民宣传队员的成分是比较复杂的，还有些队员兼职过多，工作过忙，流动性很大。因此党的宣传部对市民宣传队应不断地加以整顿，吸收新的积极分子参加；调整兼职，经常检查工作情况，发现了缺点偏向，立即加以改正。
    五、市民宣传队的工作必须和中苏友好协会组织、民主妇女联合会组织以及文化馆的宣传工作配合起来。由党委统一领导，使这些宣传力量分工合作，各尽所长。
    六、市民宣传队员都是不脱离生产的群众，领导机关必须照顾他们的生产和生活，不要分配过多的任务，以致弄得他们疲于奔命；并应经常给以适当的表扬和鼓励，以提高他们的工作积极性。
