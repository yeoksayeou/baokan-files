(Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi) The full text of the speech given by Ding Xilin, head of the People's Republic of China Cultural Delegation, at a farewell banquet held by the Indian government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 28th is as follows:

    The schedule for the stay of the People's Republic of China Cultural Delegation in the Republic of India is coming to an end. Today, our delegation is honored to be formally invited to a banquet by the Indian government. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to bid farewell to the Indian government and the Indian people and express our sincere gratitude. During our visit to India, whether it was to large cities, small towns, schools, research institutes, factories, or historical sites, we received proper arrangements and warm welcomes from local governments, local people, professors, scholars, and people from all walks of life. We believe that this is extremely meaningful and is the most significant expression of international friendship between China and India. We, the Chinese people, excitedly accept this expression of friendship, taking it as a result of the efforts of cultural workers in India and China, as a noble concern of the Indian people for the new achievements of New China, and also as a reliable guarantee for the cause of Asian peace. There is no doubt that this will make the friendship between our two great nations closer and more solid, and will play a significant role in today's and tomorrow's world. You and we have mentioned Faxian and Xuanzang, as well as Zhu Falan and She Moteng, and even more so Tagore and Kotnis. These are extremely valuable historical proofs of our Sino-Indian friendship. Both the Indian and Chinese peoples value and cherish this history. This is precisely because these great figures are the best examples of promoting Sino-Indian friendly relations; they instruct us on how to understand each other and how to be friends.

    I can cite a recent example to illustrate the continued existence of this historical tradition. That is the visit of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China, which recently returned from Beijing. Although we did not meet on the road, my colleagues and I were fortunate to be able to pay our respects to many representatives of the delegation in India, including their leader, Mr. Sundarlal. They were welcomed by the Chinese people during their stay in China and aroused great attention from the people of your country after their return home. Judging from these circumstances, I must say, and I dare to assert that you will agree with me, that they have successfully completed their mission, and they have made a great contribution to the friendship between China and India.

    In any case, China and India have a shared historical and practical background for completing Sino-Indian friendship, and the Chinese and Indian peoples have a common demand to enhance this friendship to maintain world peace.

    Therefore, when we came to India from China two months ago, we brought with us nothing else but the Chinese people's infinite care, deep respect, and friendship for the Indian people. When we arrived in India and were with our Indian friends, we believed that we had already conveyed this care and respect to the Indian people. Our delegation is honored to be able to undertake this task, which, of course, was completed with the help of the Indian government and the Indian people.

    The Indian architecture, sculptures, paintings, dances, and music that we have seen here have made us deeply aware that the Indian people have created such great and magnificent examples for human culture with their high degree of diligence and wisdom. Various universities, research institutes, and water conservancy projects all have their own achievements. All of this shows that the Indian people are striving forward.

    We have been to Chiggor in the north and Trivandrum in the south. Some places are recorded as having been visited by Faxian and Xuanzang, which made us have infinite admiration for the historical achievements of Chinese scholars and travelers in Sino-Indian relations. Although our contact with people in Indian academic, cultural, and artistic circles was very short, we believe that every meeting has increased mutual understanding. We value this very much because true friendship comes from sincere understanding. We also felt the warmth of the welcome from university students. The awarding of honorary degrees by Delhi University to Dr. Feng Youlan and myself, and the awarding of an honorary Doctor of Laws degree to me by Osmania University in Hyderabad, undoubtedly added new records to the history of Sino-Indian cultural relations.

    Friendly associations between India and China are being widely established in major cities and are doing good work in the friendship between India and China. This made a deep impression on us, and our response is that we will similarly strengthen our efforts for Sino-Indian friendship in China.

    Naturally, due to limitations of time and region, it is impossible to make a general visit to such a large country in six weeks. We have received letters and telegrams of invitation from various educational and cultural organizations. Although we were unable to accept all of these invitations, we fully understood the goodwill and friendship of these organizations. We express our apologies and gratitude to them here.

    During our visit, our Chinese Cultural Delegation introduced some issues of cultural development in New China to our Indian friends, and we did our best to answer the questions raised by our Indian friends about the cultural activities and social life of New China. This clearly demonstrates the Indian people's friendly feelings towards New China and their great interest in the achievements of New China over the past two years. When we see such a surge of friendly feelings and the breadth of that practical interest, we certainly feel that the work of our delegation in this regard has only made a preliminary contribution to the great cause of enhancing cultural friendship between China and India. We will never be satisfied because we have a long history of relations. The new friendship developed for the sake of peace in Asia and the world should be like the rising sun. It requires the cultural circles of India and the cultural circles of China to make continuous efforts. We came here for this purpose. At the same time, for the same purpose, our government has invited an Indian Cultural Delegation to our country.

    The new China is a people's China that has overthrown one hundred years of imperialism and more than two thousand years of feudalism and has gained independence and liberation, but the foundation of this new China is still the original China, an agricultural China. The efforts of all Chinese people are not only to seek independence and liberation but also to seek prosperity and strength, and to demand the industrialization of China. It is, of course, very obvious that the Chinese people sincerely demand world peace for the industrialization and construction of the country. The Chinese people, of course, thank the Indian people for their sympathy for our struggle and their concern for our achievements.

    Tomorrow we will set off for Benares, Patna, and finally Calcutta. In another ten days, we will bid farewell to our Indian friends and leave the borders of the Republic of India, which has treated us so kindly. Although we are leaving the borders of the Republic of India, we do not think that the work of our delegation is over. We will continue to introduce regular contacts between domestic universities and Indian universities, introduce regular contacts between research institutions and Indian research institutions, introduce regular contacts between Chinese literature, art, film, and music organizations and Indian literature, art, film, and music groups; and more importantly, report to our Chinese people on the living conditions and cultural undertakings of the Indian people. At the same time, we will also report on the Indian people's sympathy and broad interest in our New China's struggles and achievements. This sympathy and broad interest is the precious friendship of the Indian people, which will surely inspire and encourage us to strive for the common cause of world peace.

    Finally, we repeat: the Chinese people have always been peaceful and friendly to the Indian people. The days spent in India are important and happy days for us, and we will always remember them.

    Thanks to the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru for their concern for Sino-Indian friendship and for inviting the Chinese Cultural Delegation to visit India and for providing great assistance.

    增进中国人民和印度人民的文化友谊
    ——我国文化代表团团长丁西林在印度外交部欢送宴会上的讲话
    【新华社讯】新德里消息：中华人民共和国文化代表团团长丁西林十一月二十八日在印度政府外交部举行的欢送该代表团的宴会上的讲话全文如下：
    中华人民共和国文化代表团在印度共和国停留的日程快要结束了。今天本团承印度政府的正式宴请，本团特借此向印度政府及印度人民告别并表示诚挚的谢意。本团在访问印度时期内，访问的地方不论其为大城市、小集镇、学校、研究所、工厂或名胜古迹，都得到当地政府、当地人民、教授、学者和其他各方人士的妥善的安置与热烈的欢迎。我们以为这是极有意义的，这是中印间的国际友谊最显著的表示。我们中国人民兴奋地接受这种友谊的表示，把它当成印度与中国的文化工作者的努力的结果，把它当成印度人民对新中国的新的成就的高尚关怀；同时也把它当成亚洲和平事业可靠的保证。这无疑问地将使我们两大民族的友谊更亲密与巩固起来，而对现实世界的今天及未来起着重大的作用。你们和我们都提到法显与玄奘，也提到竺法兰和摄摩腾，更提到泰戈尔与柯德华，这是我们中印友谊极可宝贵的历史的证明。印度人民与中国人民都是看重和爱护这个历史的。这正是因为这些伟大的人物是促进中印友好关系的最好的榜样，他们指示我们如何去互相了解与怎样做朋友之道。
    我可以举最近的一个例子，说明这个历史传统的继续存在。那就是不久以前从北京回国的印度亲善访华团的事情。虽然我们没有在路上相遇，我和我的同事们很幸运，能够在印度向访华团的很多位代表，其中还有他们的团长森德拉尔致敬。他们在逗留中国期间受到了中国人民的欢迎，在回国以后又引起了贵国人民的很大注意。从这些情况看来，我必须说，而且我敢断定你们一定会同意我这样说，他们是圆满地完成了他们的任务；他们对于中印两国的友谊作了很大的贡献。
    无论如何，中国和印度有完成中印友谊的历史的与现实的共同背景，中国人民与印度人民有增进这种友谊来保持世界和平的共同要求。
    因此，我们两个月以前从中国来的时候，带到印度的不是别的什么东西，正是中国人民对印度人民无限的关怀与深切的敬意和友谊。当我们到达印度和印度朋友们在一起的时候，我们相信已经把这种关怀与敬意交给印度人民了。本代表团以能够担当这一任务为光荣，自然这一任务是在印度政府与印度人民的帮助之下完成的。
    我们在这里访问时所见到的印度建筑、雕刻、绘画、舞蹈和音乐，使我们深刻地认识到印度人民以其高度的勤劳与智慧为人类文化创造了如此伟大与壮丽的范例。各个大学、各个研究所以及水利工程均各有它们本身的成就。这一切说明印度人民正在努力前进。
    我们北面到过纸格尔，南面到过垂卧抓姆，有些地方纪录上载明是法显与玄奘停留过的地方，更使我们对于中国的前辈学者与游历家在中印关系上所完成的历史伟迹发生无限的敬仰。我们与印度学术界、文化界、艺术界的人士，虽然接触时间很短，但相信每一次的会晤都曾增加了相互的了解，我们非常重视，因为真诚的友谊是会从真诚的了解上得来的。各大学学生对我们的欢迎，我们同样感到亲切。德里大学给冯友兰博士和我以荣誉学位，海得拉巴的奥斯马尼亚大学授给我以法学博士的名誉学位，无疑地这都使中印文化关系的历史增加了新的纪录。
    在各大城市印中友好协会在广泛地建立，并在印度与中国的友谊关系上做了很好的工作。这使我们得到深刻的印象，我们的回答是我们要在中国同样地加强中印友好的努力。
    自然为时间所限，为地区所限，在如此大的国家要想在六个星期普遍访问也是不可能的。我们收到各教育组织和各文化组织的函电邀请，虽然我们不可能接受所有的这些邀请，但对这些组织的善意和友谊是完全领会的。我们在这里对他们表示歉意和感谢。
    在访问期间，我们中国文化代表团曾把新中国的文化发展的若干问题介绍给我们的印度朋友，我们并尽了自己的可能来回答印度朋友对我们所提出的新中国文化活动与社会生活的那些问题，这里明显地表现印度人民对新中国的友好的感情与对新中国的两年来的成就感到极大的兴趣。当我们看到这种友好感情的洋溢与那种实际兴趣的广泛的时候，我们当然感觉到本代表团在这方面的工作，对增进中国与印度的文化友谊这一巨大事业，只是作了初步的贡献，我们绝不因我们有了悠久的历史关系而感到满足，为了亚洲与世界和平而发展的新的友谊，应当如同东升的太阳，它要求印度的文化界与中国的文化界还要作不断的努力。我们到这里来就是为了这个目的。同时，为了同样的目的，我国政府邀请印度文化代表团到我国去。
    新的中国是推翻了一百年的帝国主义与二千多年的封建主义而获得了独立与解放的人民的中国，但这个新的中国的基础还是原来的中国一个农业的中国。我们全中国人民的努力不仅在于求得独立与解放，并且在于求得富强与繁荣，要求中国的工业化。中国人民为了国家的工业化及建设，诚实地要求世界和平，这一点当然是非常明显的，中国人民当然感谢印度人民对我们斗争的同情与其成就的关切。
    明天我们就要动身到贝拿勒斯、巴特那去，最后到加尔各答去。再过十天以后，就要与我们的印度朋友们告别了，就要离开款待我们的印度共和国的国境了。我们虽然离开印度共和国的国境，但我们不认为本代表团的工作就完毕，我们还要继续介绍国内各大学与印度的各大学建立经常联系，介绍各研究机关与印度的各研究机关建立经常联系，介绍中国的文学、艺术、电影、音乐的组织与印度的文学、艺术、电影、音乐的团体建立经常联系；而更重要的是向我们中国人民报告印度人民的生活情况与文化事业，同时也将报告印度人民对我们新中国的斗争与成就的同情与广泛兴趣。这种同情与广泛兴趣就是可宝贵的印度人民的友谊，它定会启发和鼓励我们去为世界和平的共同事业而努力。
    最后我们重复地说：中国人民对印度人民一贯是和平友好的。留在印度的日子，对我们来说是重要而快乐的日子，我们将永远记忆着它。
    向关切中印友谊、并邀请中国文化代表团访问印度而给以巨大协助的印度政府和尼赫鲁总理致谢。
