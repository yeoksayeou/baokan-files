    State-run Pingxiang Coal Mine
    Poor Planning in Purchasing Machines for Ventilation Shaft Construction Causes Waste
    Editor: There is waste at the state-run Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi Province. The Quanjin Power Plant, which belongs to the Pingxiang Coal Mine, bought twelve electric fans this year, intending to install them on the large boilers to reduce the boiler heat. However, the staff responsible for planning were careless and miscalculated the size of the electric fans, rendering them unusable. This resulted in a loss of more than six million yuan. They also bought an oil filter, but due to incorrect planning, it could not be used after purchase, wasting over ten million yuan for nothing. Recently, Pit 1 of the Longhu Mine dug a stone gate ventilation shaft underground. The engineering staff did not consult with the workers and insisted that the workers carry out the construction according to their plan. The workers knew that the ventilation shaft was being dug in the wrong place and asked the administrative side to reconsider. The administrative side did not study the matter carefully and insisted on continuing. After digging seventeen meters, the administrative side realized that it was impossible to continue and stopped. This useless ventilation shaft wasted more than 250 man-days, 400 detonators, and more than 400 cartridges of explosives, estimated to be worth over fifteen million yuan. I believe Pingxiang Coal Mine should correct this wasteful phenomenon.

### 国营萍乡煤矿  买机器筑风巷计划不周造成浪费

    国营萍乡煤矿
    买机器筑风巷计划不周造成浪费
    编辑同志：江西省国营萍乡煤矿有浪费现象。萍乡煤矿所属泉江电厂在今年买了十二部电风扇，打算装在大锅炉上，以便减低锅炉热度。但做计划的工作人员太不注意，把电风扇的尺码都估计错了，因而这些电风扇都不能用。这一项就损失了六百多万元。他们又买了一部滤油机，也是因为计划不正确，买回来后不能使用，白白花了一千多万元。龙虎矿一坑最近在井下打了一条石门风巷，工程人员也不和工人商量，就要工人照他的计划施工。工人们知道这条风巷打错了，要行政方面重新考虑。行政方面并不好好研究，坚持非打不可。打了十七公尺，行政方面眼看实在不能再打了，才停下来。这
    一条无用的风巷共浪费人工二百五十多个，雷管四百个、炸药四百多筒，估计价值一千五百多万元。我认为萍乡煤矿应纠正这种浪费现象。
