Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Paris "Tonight" reporter Bechet reported from Panmunjom on December 12th: The two subcommittees began working in the tents here this morning, and the Korean and Chinese representatives once again cleared the way for a quick agreement. But so far, the U.S. side has shown no willingness to abandon their delaying tactics. The U.S. side has recently done nothing but another round of bombing and strafing incidents. The current situation is that one side is working hard for an early peace, while the other side is only talking about an early peace. On the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, the U.S. side showed the same tendency yesterday, which is to avoid discussing matters of principle and only talk about details. The Korean and Chinese side's suggestion is clear and correct: "Send all prisoners of war home quickly after the armistice agreement is signed." General Lee Sang-cho told the U.S. side: "We are fully prepared to discuss the prisoner of war issue and are prepared to release prisoners of war after the armistice agreement is signed." The U.S. side put forward a vague plan of so-called "fair and just basis." According to the explanation made by Nacos, the spokesperson of the U.S. delegation, to American reporters, this plan means that during the armistice, the number of prisoners of war released by the U.S. side will not be more than the number of prisoners of war they receive. The U.S. representatives talked a lot about "humanitarianism" and allowing Red Cross personnel to enter the country, but General Lee pointed out that undoubtedly, the most humanitarian way to deal with this problem is to let all prisoners of war go home to live a happy life. General Lee directly asked the U.S. side if they intended to "release some prisoners of war and detain some prisoners of war after the armistice agreement is signed." The U.S. representatives did not answer this question. Just like when discussing the third agenda item, the U.S. side refused to state their position.
　　The U.S. side once again put forward their suggestions on the third agenda item, a total of seven points. These seven suggestions are just a replica of the suggestions they have made in the past, but with some slight changes in wording, the main differences still exist. They rejected the principle of establishing a neutral nations supervisory organization and proposed the establishment of inspection teams with neutral nations personnel participating. The U.S. side still insists that troops and weapons can be rotated, prohibits the construction of defensive equipment, and insists on conducting aerial reconnaissance. Regarding the issue of coastal islands, they only promised to withdraw from islands within "territorial waters." Their suggestion argued sophistically: The territory of a country only includes its mainland, and any island beyond three miles from the coast is not included in the territory of the country. This is truly the most absurd definition of "territorial waters" that has ever existed.
　　As long as the U.S. side continues to adopt this attitude, no progress can be made in the negotiations.

　　斥美方拖延谈判的新花样
　 【新华社十三日讯】法国巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌十二日自板门店报道：两个小组委员会十二日上午在此间帐篷中开始工作，朝中代表又一次为迅速获致协议扫清道路。但迄今为止，美方毫未表示愿意放弃他们拖延的态度。美方最近所做的事只是又一次的轰炸扫射事件。目前的情况是，一边正为早日获得和平而努力，而另一边却在空谈早日获得和平。在交换战俘问题上，美方昨天表现了同样趋向，那就是避免讨论原则问题，而一味谈论细节问题。朝中方面的建议是清楚而正确的：“在停战协议签字后迅速遣送全体战俘。”李相朝将军告诉美方：“我们完全准备讨论战俘问题，并准备在签订停战协议后释放战俘。”美方提出了所谓“在公平与公正的基础上”的含糊方案，按照美方代表团发言人纳科斯向美国记者所作的解释，这个方案的意思是：在停战期间，美方释放的战俘将不多于他们所得到的获释的战俘。美方代表侈谈什么“人道主义”，什么准许红十字会人员入境，但李将军指出，无疑，处理这个问题的最人道的方法是让全体战俘回家过幸福的生活。李将军直率地问美方是不是打算“在停战协议签字后释放一部分战俘而扣留一部分战俘”。美方代表对这个问题未作答复。就像在讨论第三项议程时一样，美方拒绝表明他们的态度。
    美方再度提出了他们对第三项议程的建议，建议共分七点。这七点建议，只是他们过去所提出的建议的翻版，不过在措词上稍微有一些变更罢了，主要的分歧仍然存在。他们拒绝了成立中立国监督机构的原则，提出了成立有中立国人员参加的视察小组的建议。美方仍然坚持军队和武器可以轮换，禁止修建防御设备，并坚持要进行空中侦察。关于沿海岛屿的问题，他们只答应从“领海”以内的岛屿撤退。他们的建议强词夺理地说：一国的领土，只包括它的大陆，距海岸三哩以外的任何岛屿，就不包括在这个国家的领土之内。这真是从来不曾有过的最荒谬的关于“领海”的定义。
    只要美方继续采取这种态度，谈判就不可能获得任何进展。
