Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 14th: Panchen Erdeni sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Peng Dehuai, Vice Chairmen Xi Zhongxun, Zhang Zhizhong of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and the leaders of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet before leaving Qinghai Province to return to Tibet. Chairman Mao replied with encouragement. In addition, Panchen Erdeni also sent telegrams to the officials and monks and lay people of the Zhaxilhunbu Monastery and all the monks and lay people of Xigaze.

The texts of the telegrams are as follows:

I. Telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong

Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise and correct leadership, the Tibetan issue, which had not been and could not be resolved for many years, has been resolved. This has not only brought about the victorious unification of the entire mainland but also rescued the Tibetan people and the Tibetan people from the sea of suffering, leading them to a bright and happy road. As Panchen leaves Qinghai to return to Tibet, I would like to extend my highest respect to you with the utmost sincerity, and express my sincere and firm determination: After returning to Tibet this time, I must closely unite with the Dalai Lama under your leadership, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, to discuss everything together, to strive for the thorough implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, to eliminate imperialist influence in Tibet, consolidate national defense, and build a new Tibet.

II. Telegram to Chairman Peng Dehuai, Xi Zhongxun, and Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairmen of the Northwest Military and Political Committee

Since the liberation of the Northwest, I have been cared for by you, and Panchen has received warmth that he has never experienced since living in the interior. Now that Tibet has been peacefully liberated, and the Dalai Lama has repeatedly sent telegrams urging Panchen to return, Panchen has decided to depart for Tibet on December 15th. I would like to express my highest gratitude to you, and I am willing to repay you by taking practical actions after returning to Tibet to promote the early and complete realization of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

III. Telegram to Commander Zhang Guohua, Political Commissar Tan Guansan, Commander Fan Ming, Political Commissar Mu Shengzhong, and all commanders and combatants of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet

You have endured untold hardships for the liberation of the Tibetan people and have successively and victoriously arrived in Lhasa, stationed in Xigaze City, and the important town of Gyantse. Your heroic and remarkable actions have demonstrated the sincerity in implementing the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, bringing infinite light and happiness to the Tibetan people, thereby the imperialist influence in Tibet will be quickly eliminated, and the construction of the Tibetan people's cause will be strongly guaranteed. As Panchen returns to Tibet, in addition to sending a telegram of respect, I also assure you that after returning to Tibet, I will do my best to help the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet strengthen the unity between the army and the people.

IV. Telegram to the officials and monks and lay people of the Zhaxilhunbu Monastery and all the monks and lay people of Xigaze

To the officials and monks and lay people of the Zhaxilhunbu Monastery and all the monks and lay people of Xigaze:

Nearly half a year has passed since the signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. I should have returned to Tibet earlier to build a new Tibet with you, but due to living far in the interior, the preparations were more complicated, which caused a delay. Now, with the active help of the Central People's Government, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and the Qinghai Provincial People's Government at all levels, the preparatory work has come to an end, and I will depart from Qinghai Province on December 15th (Tibetan calendar October 17th) to return to Tibet. I hope that all the people of Tibet will, in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, in close unity with the Dalai Lama and everyone, and with the assistance of the vast masses of people across the country, work together to thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, and lead the vast people of Tibet and all ethnic groups of the country towards a bright and great path to victory.

Chairman Mao's Reply

To Mr. Panchen Erdeni, via the Qinghai Provincial People's Government: Thank you for your telegram. I fully agree with your aspiration to closely unite with the Dalai Lama under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, to strive for the thorough implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, to eliminate imperialist influence in Tibet, consolidate national defense, and build a new Tibet. And I wish you a smooth arrival at your destination.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Mao Zedong

Panchen Erdeni's Telegram to the Dalai Lama

Dalai Lama: I have repeatedly received your telegrams. In order to build a new Tibet, you urged me to return to Tibet as soon as possible, prepared everything for me, and ordered the fifth generation Benhou to protect me. I am very grateful for these great kindnesses. Now I have decided to return to Tibet on December 15th of this year (October 17th of the Tibetan calendar Iron Rabbit year). I hereby send a telegram to inform you, and I sincerely assure you that after returning to Tibet this time, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, I will further strengthen the unity within our Tibetan ethnic group and closely cooperate with the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the country to strive together for the rapid and thorough implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the construction of a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Panchen Erdeni

    各电电文如下：
    一、致毛泽东主席电
    敬爱的毛主席：
    在您的英明正确领导下，使好多年来没有也不可能解决的西藏问题获得了解决。这不仅使全国大陆胜利统一，而且拯救了西藏民族与西藏人民于苦海，走向光明幸福的大道。现值班禅离青返藏之际，谨以至诚向您致以崇高的敬意，并以至诚坚决表示：这次返藏以后，一定要在您、中国共产党和中央人民政府领导之下与达赖佛紧密团结，共商一切，为彻底实现和平解放西藏办法的协议，驱除帝国主义在西藏的影响，巩固国防和建设新西藏而奋斗。二、致西北军政委员会彭德怀主席、习仲勋、张治中副主席电
    西北解放以后，敬蒙您们的关怀，班禅得到了自寄居内地以来从来没有过的温暖。现因西藏业已和平解放，达赖佛屡电促班禅返回，班禅已决定于十二月十五日动身返藏。兹特向您们致以崇高的谢意，并愿意返藏后以促成和平解放西藏办法的协议早日全部实现的实际行动来报答您们。
    三、致人民解放军入藏部队张国华司令员、谭冠三政治委员，

    和平解放西藏办法的协议的签订，迄今将近半年。我本应早日返藏与大家共同建设新西藏，但由于远居内地，准备较繁，以致拖延时日。现在在中央人民政府与西北军政委员会、青海省各级人民政府的积极帮助下，筹备工作已告结束，并于十二月十五日（藏历十月十七日）由青海省启程返藏。望全藏人民今后在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在达赖佛及大家亲密团结和全国广大人民群众的协助下，为彻底实现和平解放西藏办法的协议，建设一个繁荣幸福的新西藏，使西藏广大人民和全国各民族人民一道走向光明伟大的胜利途径而共同努力。毛主席复电
    青海省人民政府转班禅额尔德尼先生：感谢你的来电。我完全同意你的这种志愿，即在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，与达赖喇嘛紧密团结，为彻底实行和平解放西藏办法的协议，驱除帝国主义在西藏的影响，巩固国防和建设新西藏而奋斗。并祝你顺利地到达目的地。
                毛泽东

    达赖佛：屡奉电示。为了建设新西藏，你促我早日返藏，为我筹备一切，并令第五代本候命保护。这些盛情厚意，使我万分感谢。现我已决定于今年十二月十五日（藏历铁兔年十月十七日）返藏，谨电奉闻；并以至诚向您保证：这次返藏后，在毛主席、共产党与中央人民政府领导下，进一步加强我藏族内部的团结，并与国内各兄弟民族人民亲密合作，为迅速彻底实现和平解放西藏办法的协议，建设一个繁荣幸福的新西藏而共同奋斗。
