Stop the War
-- Speech at the Vienna World Peace Council
Soviet Writer Ilya Ehrenburg

A French radio commentator recently said with melancholy when discussing the international situation: "The November fog, like the July thunderstorm, is not worth fussing about." The meeting of the World Peace Council opened in dark and uneasy days. People all over the world are watching us with anticipation. We must point out the way out and speak words that can promote agreement. We must dispel the November fog and prevent the July thunderstorm.

People all over the world greeted the news of the start of the Korean negotiations with pleasure. They were happy because the people of this devastated country could finally spend their first peaceful night; they were happy because reason finally triumphed over ignorance after many long years. In principle, if a war in one place could turn into a world war every minute, then an agreement in one place would also give people reason to hope that it could lay the foundation for world peace. However, people soon saw that the negotiations were being obstructed by malicious people, and that the bombing of peaceful Korean cities was intensifying. The successors of the MacArthur spirit are determined to start fires everywhere. The "peace treaty with Japan," which cannot be called a peace treaty, is arming Germany, rearming many European countries, establishing new military bases on foreign territories, and attempting to force the Near East and Middle East countries to become war bases by force - this is what we see in the foggy days of late autumn.

Those who are preparing for a new war are sowing seeds of terror, hatred, and despair in the hearts of their compatriots. They are eliminating what is most important to mankind - confidence in tomorrow. Newspapers and radio stations are clamoring about new methods of mass murder every day. Of course, there is much exaggeration in these stories, and even much delirium, just as the ancient utopian believers depicted the pictures of the happiness of all mankind, now the utopian believers of the New World are depicting the destruction of all mankind. But, taking what already exists, it is enough to turn places full of flowers into ruins, enough to destroy cities created by centuries of labor.

A group of indiscriminate philosophers attribute all sins to science, believing that the greatest inventions have brought the greatest disasters to mankind. Prometheus stealing fire from heaven is a beautiful myth. He was therefore chained to a cliff, and eagles dug out his heart and liver. He could learn from the eagle's mouth that Grostratus (note) burned the Temple of Kana (Temple of the Greek Goddess - translator) or that the lackeys of Xerxes (Persian Emperor - translator) burned Athens, and self-condemned: Why did I give fire and fire to mankind? We are proud that the World Peace Council is led by a famous scholar who has helped mankind utilize atomic energy. Just as Prometheus cannot be held responsible for Grostratus, neither Joliot-Curie nor other scholars who devote themselves to analyzing the atomic nucleus can be held responsible for the sinful use of their inventions.

Hundreds of millions of men and women of different faiths around the world solemnly demand the prohibition of atomic weapons. However, those who are preparing for a new war still place their hopes on this weapon of mass murder. Almost every month, one or two members of the US Congress demand the immediate use of atomic bombs. For five years, mankind has been forced to live with demons with cruel, vicious, and terrifying hearts. They play with atomic bombs at every turn, calculating how many millions of innocent people can be killed. Perhaps thinking that the old tune of the atomic bomb is not loud enough, these conscienceless guys are clamoring about hydrogen bombs, poison gas, and germ warfare again.

It is reported that people in New Jersey are taking fingerprints of their children in order to identify their bodies after an atomic bombing. This method is really inexplicable. Any elementary school student will ask: Why does the atomic bomb blow up the faces beyond recognition, but it favors the fingers? Only one thing is clear here: the atomic bomb has already made many people frightened and even crazy before it explodes.

The Director of the New York State Education Bureau issued an instruction on school atomic bomb prevention drills. This madman wrote: "Like the habit of brushing your teeth every day, this drill should become a pleasant lesson to be done every day." We see the final stage of mental illness: an educator actually calls preparing for an atomic bomb bombing a pleasant lesson.

The United States is stepping up preparations for the use of atomic weapons, and there is plenty of evidence, such as supplementary budgets, atomic bomb exercises in Nevada, and the expansion of atomic bomb production. "Newsweek" magazine wrote: "We are approaching the era of inexhaustible atomic bombs." The New York correspondent of the "Manchester Guardian" wrote: "Now, people have come to regard the atomic arms race as inevitable as taxation and death." These words are indeed thought-provoking. Of course, there was taxation before the atomic bomb was invented, but the large amount of money handed over to the state today is used to manufacture weapons of murder. Needless to say, mankind had death before it learned to split the atomic nucleus, but now, mankind has the prospect of premature death - this is because of the atomic bomb.

The serious threat of using atomic weapons, created by the United States single-handedly for five years, has forced those countries threatened by the United States to also equip themselves with atomic weapons. On October 9 this year, London Radio admitted: "Now everyone is clear. The era when the United States alone possessed the atomic bomb as a means of intimidation is gone forever."

That's right, the guys who eat blackmail are still blackmailing. They want people to believe that the United States still has an advantage in atomic weapons. Atomic bomb fanatic William Laurence insisted: "The Soviet atomic bomb can only be called an old-fashioned hand-cranked car, while the American atomic bomb is the latest limousine." One thing must be reminded: fifteen years ago, British and German, American and French newspapers repeatedly proved to readers that Russian weapons were backward and that the Russians could not withstand a single blow. William Laurence's friends once wrote: "The Soviet Union - it's just a colossus with feet of clay." Everyone knows that later facts overturned this superficial argument: the "colossus with feet of clay" strode to Berlin. However, it was precisely this kind of fabricated slander about the Soviet Union's weakness that led Hitler to a sinful adventure. William Laurence and other atomic bomb blackmail experts are determined to push new adventurers to new sins.

London Radio opposed the prohibition of atomic weapons, saying that the Americans have more atomic bombs than the Russians. Well, even if the staff of the British Broadcasting Corporation has calculated the stock of atomic bombs clearly, he has forgotten one fact: in any case, these atomic bombs are enough to turn a country that once became an aircraft carrier for atomic bombers into a new Hiroshima.

Millions of people in Western Europe understand what an atomic war is. Regardless of who wins the war, it will bring rubble and death to their densely populated countries that pride themselves on their ancient cities. Ernest Lindley wrote in "Newsweek": What Americans now fear is not a Soviet attack, but propaganda in favor of banning atomic weapons, because America's European allies are able to take the path of international agreements banning the use of atomic weapons. The commentator of the "New York Post", Marcus Rener, also fears this, saying that the terror of the disaster of atomic war has strengthened the forces of neutral factions in Britain and Western European countries, the Near East and the Middle East, India and other countries in Asia. When the "New York Times" discussed Stalin's conversation with the reporter of Pravda, it wrote: The movement to strive for neutrality is growing in Europe, and said that "a simplest formula - banning the use of bombs has produced a strong psychological effect." The London "Economist" magazine pointed out that many politicians who participated in the Atlantic Treaty Organization have begun to shift to a position against atomic war. In this way, the loss of the US monopoly on atomic weapons is creating an atmosphere of international agreement to ban such weapons.

Last spring, I talked to a famous Belgian senator, a member of the Socialist Party, about the possibility of him supporting the Stockholm Declaration. The senator frankly told me that when the United States had a monopoly on atomic weapons, he was once a supporter of atomic weapons, and he believed that atomic weapons were a "humane weapon" because this weapon could end the war very quickly. But when he learned that the Russians had also mastered the secret of making atomic bombs, he changed his views and believed that atomic weapons were by no means a humane weapon. Some people demand the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons because they are truly humanitarians. Because they hate the plan of mass slaughter of civilians. Other people also come to make the same demands because they are worried about their homes, their children, and their lives. We don't need to analyze the reasons, even if they don't have any malicious intentions, if these intentions are all to promote mankind to do good. We must unite all enemies of atomic weapons, regardless of their motives.

Now various different voices are being spread in the United States, which can never be said to be the voice of negotiations for the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons advocated by our friends. I repeat, I don't want to pursue the roots of peace wishes. But when the "Atlanta Constitution" writes: After Stalin's statement, we must open the door to banning the use of atomic weapons and international control, I reply: We can find a common language with this newspaper.

However, the clamor of atomic bomb blackmail in the United States still drowns out the voices of sober-minded people. In recent weeks, Senators Frier, Johnson, Caine, and Lowes have all demanded the rapid use of atomic weapons in Korea. New York State Governor Dewey stated on October 14 that atomic bombs must be dropped on Manchuria. Many American newspapers infer that the question of dropping atomic bombs in Korea will be determined by the results of the experiment at the Las Vegas (a small town in Nevada, USA - translator) bombing range. Finally, the American radio station "Free Europe" recently transmitted the news that Washington is holding a secret meeting to discuss the possibility of using atomic weapons in Korea.

Before me is a recent issue of the best-selling American magazine "Collier's." This issue is a special issue describing the war against the Soviet Union. The contributors to this issue include famous American and British writers. "Collier's" described the scene of Moscow and other Russian cities being destroyed by atomic bombs. Needless to say, according to "Collier's," the Americans won, and American troops are stationed in the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe. "Collier's" described how the American occupation forces established the American way of life in Russia, especially staging the American operetta "Lazybones and Women" in the theaters of Moscow, and selling the "Collier's" magazine published in Russian in the newsstands of Moscow. According to these gentlemen, this is why it is necessary to destroy Moscow, London, and Paris with atomic bombs, and to destroy tens of thousands of innocent people. Even the French "Le Monde," which no one can point out has offended the Americans in the slightest, could not help but call this issue of "Collier's" a "provocation."

Faced with these facts, we - the World Peace Council, are required to take the current situation extremely seriously. The signatures of hundreds of millions of people who support the Stockholm Declaration have played a role. Since then, the movement to defend peace has been raised and expanded. We can say: The decision on the use of atomic weapons - whether in Korea, Manchuria, or elsewhere - is not the result of the experiment at the Las Vegas bombing range, but the vigilance and determination of all peoples who have enough power to prevent all evil crimes.

An international agreement prohibiting atomic weapons must be reached: without it, the peaceful life of mankind cannot be imagined. The five major powers must obtain a universally recognized formula that will end the expansion of armaments and prohibit the use of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass murder. This agreement will certainly be able to open an era of peaceful coexistence of various different systems. The resolution of the Warsaw Congress pointed out the possibility of genuine international control. This control can not only check the declared arms factories and arsenals in any country at any time, but also check the locations that feel dangerous to any country. International control can gradually eliminate mutual suspicion and help establish lasting peace.

Surrounding us with various suggestions on the prohibition of atomic weapons, we must unite all honest people, not only those who were with us yesterday, but also those who are still skeptical about the movement of world peace defenders today. I want to say to these people: To tell the truth, for men and women anywhere in the world, millions of peace defenders are much less dangerous than an atomic bomb!

We, the Soviet representatives of the World Peace Council, are not advocating the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons because we do not have the power and are afraid of American bombs, but because we wish all cities - whether they are Soviet, Chinese, or American - to be spared from destruction. We demand that the governments of the five major powers immediately begin negotiations on a peace treaty, first of all to negotiate disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

I call on those who are far away from our movement - followers of all parties, all philosophical theories, pacifists, non-resistanceists, "neutralists," supporters of "world government," and successors of Gandhi to discuss the most important issue: how to stop the war. I have heard more than once such an argument that different political opinions hinder the common struggle to defend peace. Someone said: "I cannot fight with you to defend peace because I do not like the Soviet system." I feel that these answers are either extremely naive or extremely cunning. If we, the Soviet peace defenders, only want to discuss with people who agree with us, then we would not be sitting here and attending the World Peace Council; but we are willing to consult with those who like the American economic system, the British monarchy, or the French political system. We are willing for the five major powers to sign a peace treaty based on negotiations and based on the desire to seek a form of peaceful coexistence that is unanimously accepted.

There are many things in the United States that we Soviets abhor from the bottom of our hearts. We can criticize American economic or moral habits, but we are willing to live in peace with the United States now.

I call on all those who look at our movement with skeptical eyes: Please come closer, please listen, let's talk! We are not looking for what divides us, but for what unites us. It is ridiculous to ask neighbors to produce certificates of conduct or political identity investigation forms when a house is on fire and people are fighting the fire. The most important thing is to put out the fire to avoid burning down the house. We will argue in the future about how to build the world. But the most urgent task before us now is: Stop the war!

    制止战争
    ——在维也纳世界和平理事会上的发言
    苏联作家　爱伦堡
    一位法国的无线电评论员，最近当谈论到国际形势时忧郁地说：“十一月的雾如同七月的雷雨一样，是值不得大惊小怪的。”世界和平理事会的会议就在阴暗的、不安的日子里开幕了。全世界的人民都以期待的眼光注视着我们。我们必须指出出路，讲出能够促进协议的言语。我们必须拨开十一月的雾，预防七月的雷雨。
    全世界的人们都曾以愉快的心情，迎接朝鲜谈判开始的消息。他们高兴是因为这一个横遭蹂躏的国家的人民，从此得以度过第一个恬静的夜；他们高兴是因为在漫长的岁月里，理智终于战胜了愚昧。按理说，如果一个地方的战争每一分钟都可能变成世界战争的话，那末，一个地方的协议，也使得人民有理由希望借以奠定世界和平。但是，人们一转眼就看到谈判遭到了坏心肠的人们的阻挠，看到对朝鲜和平城市的轰炸更加紧了。麦克阿瑟精神的继承者们，念念不忘要到处放起火来。不能称之为和平条约的“对日和约”，武装德国，重新武装欧洲许多国家，在别国领土上建立新的军事基地，企图以武力迫使近东与中东各国成为战争基地——这就是我们在深秋的大雾迷漫的日子里所看到的东西。
    准备新战争的人们，在自己的同胞的心里播下恐怖、仇恨和失望的种子。他们在消除对人类最关重要的东西——对明天的信心。报纸和广播电台天天在叫嚣新的大量杀人的方法。当然，在这些故事里有许多夸大，甚至有许多梦呓，如同古代的乌托邦信徒们描绘全人类的幸福的图画一样，现在的新大陆的乌托邦信徒们，在描绘着全人类的毁灭。但是，就拿已经有了的东西来说，就足够将开满鲜花的地方变成废墟，足够毁灭用几世纪的劳动所创造的城市了。
    有一批不分青红皂白的哲学家，他们将一切罪恶都推到科学身上，他们认为最伟大的发明给人类带来了最大的灾难。普罗米修斯盗取天火是一篇美丽的神话。他因此被锁在悬岩，老鹰挖去了他的心肝，他能够从这只老鹰的口里得知格罗斯特拉特（注）焚烧了迦那庙（希腊女神庙——译者）或色克斯（波斯皇帝——译者）的喽啰们焚烧了雅典的消息，而自我谴责：为什么我将火和火种交给人类呢？我们以世界和平理事会由一位大名鼎鼎的学者来领导而自豪，他曾经帮助人类利用原子能。正如普罗米修斯不能对格罗斯特拉特负责一样，约里奥—居里也好，其他献身分析原子核的学者也好，是不能够对罪恶地使用他们的发明负责的。
    全世界不同信仰的亿万男女郑重地要求禁止原子武器。但是，准备新战争的人们，却仍然把自己的希望寄托在这个大量杀人的武器上。差不多每月都有个把美国国会的议员要求立即使用原子弹。五年来，人类被迫同心怀残忍、恶毒、恐怖的妖道们生活在一起。他们动不动就玩弄原子弹，计算着能够杀害多少百万无辜的人民。怕是认为原子弹的老调子弹不响亮了吧，这些丧尽天良的家伙们，又在叫嚣起氢气弹、毒气、细菌战来了。
    据报载：新泽西州的人们在给孩子们捺指纹，以便在遭到原子弹轰炸后辨明尸体。这种办法实在是莫名其妙，任何一个小学生都会发问：为什么原子弹把面孔炸得一塌胡涂，却偏偏对手指留情呢？这里只有一件事情是一目了然的：原子弹还没爆炸就已经使许多人惊魂失魄，甚至发狂了。
    纽约州教育局局长发出了关于学校预防原子弹演习的训令。这个狂徒写道：“像每天要刷牙的习惯一样，这样演习应成为每天都进行的愉快的功课。”我们看到最末期的精神病了：一个教育工作者居然把准备原子弹轰炸叫做愉快的功课。
    美国正在加紧准备使用原子武器，证据多得很，又是补充预算，又是在内华达演习原子弹，又是扩大原子弹生产。“新闻周刊”杂志写道：“我们已接近到原子弹取之不尽、用之不竭的纪元了。”“曼彻斯特卫报”驻纽约记者写道：“现在，人们已经把原子武器竞赛看成同课税和死亡一样，是不可避免的事情了。”这番话，的确耐人寻味。当然，在原子弹未发明以前就有税，但如今交给国家的大量的金钱却用在制造杀人武器上面了。不消说，人类在学会分裂原子核以前就有死亡，但是，现在，人类却有过早的死亡的前途——这就是因为原子弹。
    五年来由美国一手制造的使用原子武器的严重威胁，迫使那些受到美国威胁的国家也备置起原子武器。今年十月九日伦敦广播电台承认：“现在大家都清楚了。单独美国一国拥有原子弹而作为恐吓手段的时代，是一去不复返了。”
    不错，吃讹诈饭的家伙们，仍然在讹诈。他们要人们相信：美国在原子武器方面照旧占着优势。原子弹狂维廉·劳伦斯一口咬定说：“苏联的原子弹只能叫做旧式手摇车，而美国的原子弹才是最新式卧车。”有一件事情必须提醒：在十五年以前，英国和德国的、美国和法国的报纸曾经喋喋不休地向读者们反复证明，说俄国武器落后，说俄罗斯人经不起一击。维廉·劳伦斯的朋友们，当时曾经写过： “苏联——这不过是一尊泥足的巨像罢了。”大家都知道，后来的事实推翻了这种浅薄的论断：“泥足的巨像”大踏步地跨到了柏林。但是，正是这一类假造的苏联的软弱性的谰言，才使希特勒走上了罪恶的冒险。维廉·劳伦斯以及其他原子弹讹诈专家们一心想推动新的冒险家走上新的罪恶。
    伦敦广播电台在反对禁止原子武器，他们说，美国人手头的原子弹比俄国人的多。好吧，就算英国广播公司的职员把原子弹的储存量已经计算得一清二白了，但他却忘记了一个事实：不管怎样，这些原子弹也足够将一个一旦成为原子弹轰炸机的航空母舰的国家变成新的广岛的。
    西欧的千百万的人民都懂得什么是原子战争。不管战争的结果是什么人胜利，它都会给他们的以自己的古老的城市而自豪的、人口稠密的国家带来瓦砾和死亡。爱尔聂斯特·林特列衣在“新闻周刊”上写道：美国人现在要惧怕的不是苏联的进攻，而是对禁止原子武器有利的宣传，因为美国的欧洲的同盟者是能够走上国际协议禁止使用原子武器的道路的。“纽约邮报”的评论员马科斯·雷奈尔也惧怕这桩事情，他说对于原子战争的灾祸的恐怖，加强了英国和西欧各国、近东和中东、印度和亚洲其他国家的中立派的力量。“纽约时报”当讨论到斯大林对真理报记者的谈话时写道：争取中立的运动正在欧洲增长着，并说“一个最简单的公式——禁止使用炸弹产生了强烈的心理作用。”伦敦“经济学人”杂志指出，有许多参加大西洋公约国家的政治家已开始转变到反对原子战争的立场上来了。如此说来，美国对原子武器的垄断权的丧失，正造成了国际协议禁止这种武器的气氛。
    去年春天，我曾同一位著名的比利时上院议员、社会党党员谈到他支持斯德哥尔摩宣言的可能性。这位上院议员坦白地对我讲，当美国握有原子武器的垄断权的时候，他曾经是一个原子武器的拥护者，而且他曾认为原子武器是一种“人道的武器”，因为这种武器能够很迅速地结束战争。可是当他知道了俄国人也掌握了制造原子弹的秘密以后，他就改变了自己的观点，并且认为原子武器无论如何也不是一种人道的武器了。有一些人要求禁止使用原子武器是因为他们真正是人道主义者。因为他们痛恨大量屠杀平民的计划。另外一些人也来提出同样的要求，是因为他们替自己的住宅担心，替自己的子女，替自己的生命担心。我们用不着分析原因，就算他们并没有任何不良的居心好了，如果这些居心都是为着推动人类做好事的话。我们必须团结一切原子武器的敌人，不管他们的动机是怎样的。
    现在在美国国内正在传播着各种不同的呼声，这绝不能说是我们的朋友们所主张的禁止使用原子武器的谈判的声音。我再重复一遍，我不愿意追究和平愿望的根源。可是当“亚特兰大宪法报”写出：在斯大林的声明以后，必须打开禁止使用原子武器和国际管制的大门的时候，我回答：我们同这个报纸是能够找到共同的语言的。
    但是，美国的原子弹讹诈的叫嚣仍然淹没了头脑清醒的人们的呼声。最近几周，参院议员弗里尔、约翰逊、凯恩、劳氏都提出要求要迅速在朝鲜使用原子武器，纽约州州长杜威在十月十四日声明：必须在满洲投原子弹。美国的许多报纸推断：在朝鲜投掷原子弹的问题，将由在拉斯·维加斯（美国内华达州的一个小镇——译者）投弹场实验的结果来决定。最后，美国的广播电台“自由欧洲”最近传出消息说，华盛顿正召开秘密会议，讨论在朝鲜使用原子武器的可能性问题。
    我面前是一本最近一期的、销路最大的美国杂志“柯里尔”。这一期的内容是描写对苏联作战的专号。本期撰稿人有美国和英国的著名作家。“柯里尔”描写了莫斯科和俄罗斯的其他城市遭受原子弹毁坏的情景。不消说，照“柯里尔”的说法，美国人是打胜了的，美国的军队驻防在苏联和东欧各人民民主国家里。“柯里尔”叙述了美国占领军怎样在俄罗斯建立美国的生活方式，特别是在莫斯科的戏院里上演着美国小歌剧“懒汉和女人”，而在莫斯科的书亭里出售用俄文出版的“柯里尔”杂志。按照这些绅士们的意见，这就是为什么必须用原子弹毁灭莫斯科、伦敦、巴黎，必须毁灭成千成万无辜人民的原因。甚至连无论谁都指不出有丝毫得罪美国人之处的法国“世界报”都忍不住了，称这一期“柯里尔”为“挑衅”。
    面对这些事实，就要求我们——世界和平理事会，要极其严肃地对待当前的局势，拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言的亿万人的签名是起了作用的。从那时起，保卫和平的运动就提高了，扩大了。我们可以说：决定原子武器的使用的——不管是在朝鲜、满洲或在其他地方也好——不是在拉斯·维加斯投弹场实验的结果，而是有足够的力量能阻止万恶罪行的各族人民的警觉和毅力。
    禁止原子武器的国际协议必须达成：没有它，人类的和平生活是不能设想的。五大强国必须获得一致公认的公式，这会结束军备的扩张，禁止使用原子武器以及其他大量杀人的武器。这种协议一定能够开辟一个各种不同的制度和平共处的纪元。华沙大会的决议指出了真正的国际管制的可能性。这种管制不仅能够在任何国家、任何时间检查已经宣布的军火工厂和军火库，而且能检查对任何一国感到危险的地点，国际管制能够逐渐消除相互的猜疑，帮助建立持久的和平。
    环绕着我们的关于禁止原子武器的各项建议，我们必须团结一切诚实的人们，不仅要团结昨天曾同我们在一起的人们，而且要团结今天还对世界和平保卫者的运动保持怀疑态度的人们。我要对这些人说：说老实话，对于世界上任何地方的男子和妇女来说，千百万个和平保卫者比起一枚原子弹的危险性来要小得多啊！
    我们，世界和平理事会的苏联代表并不是因为我们没有力量，怕美国的炸弹才拥护禁止使用原子武器的要求，而是因为我们愿望一切城市——无论它是苏联的，中国的，美国的——都免于毁灭。我们要求五大国政府立即开始谈判和平公约，首先要谈判裁减军备和禁止原子武器。
    我号召那些远离我们的运动的人们——一切党派，一切哲学理论的信徒，和平主义者，不抵抗主义者，“中立主义者”，“世界政府”的支持者，甘地的继承者商谈一个最关重要的问题：商谈如何制止战争。我不止一次听到这样一种论调，说政治见解不同妨害了保卫和平的共同的斗争。有人说： “我不能同你们一道进行保卫和平的斗争，因为我不喜欢苏联的制度。”我感到这些答案要不就是幼稚到家，要不就是狡猾透顶。如果我们，苏联的和平保卫者，只是想同和我们思想一致的人们商谈，那末，我们就不会坐在这里，出席世界和平理事会；但是，我们愿意同那些喜欢美国的经济制度、英国的君主制度或法国的政治制度的人们协商。我们愿意五大国根据谈判，依据寻求和平共处一致接受的形式的愿望来签订和平公约。
    美国有许多事情对于我们苏联人来说是从心眼里厌恶的。我们可以批评美国的经济或道德习惯，但是，我们却愿意同现在的美国和平相处。
    我号召一切用怀疑的眼光观察我们的运动的人们：请靠近一些吧，请听一听吧，大家谈谈吧！我们并不是在寻找使我们分裂的东西，而是在寻求使我们团结在一起的东西。当着住宅起火，人们在救火的时候，还要邻人拿出操行证书或政治面目调查表来是可笑的事情。最要紧的是扑灭火灾，免得烧毁住宅。我们将来会要争论该怎样建设世界的。但现在摆在我们眼前的最迫切的任务却是：制止战争！
