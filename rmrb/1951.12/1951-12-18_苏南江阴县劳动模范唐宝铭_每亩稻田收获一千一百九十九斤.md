    Labor Model Tang Baoming of Jiangyin County, Southern Jiangsu
    Harvests 1,199 Jin of Rice per Mu
    Tang Baoming, a labor model from Mazhen Township, Jiangyin County, Southern Jiangsu Province, inspired by patriotism, created a record of harvesting 1,199 jin of rice per mu this year. His rich rice-growing experience has spread throughout the Jiangnan region.
    This year, during the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, Tang Baoming demonstrated high enthusiasm for production. In May, he was already selected as a second-class agricultural labor model in Jiangyin County. At the county's labor model conference at that time, he proposed a patriotic production plan to guarantee a yield of 1,200 jin of rice per mu this year. After nearly half a year of effort, although his 16.5 mu of rice suffered typhoon damage in mid-August, the average yield still reached 915 jin per mu, exceeding the average yield of the entire township by 46 percent. Among them, 3.3 mu of rice fields achieved a yield of 1,199 jin per mu.
    Tang Baoming has rich experience in growing rice: First, he pays great attention to seed selection. The rice he grows is called "Yellow Shell Early 20th." To maintain the purity of the seeds, he selects ears every year or every other year for more than 30 years. This type of rice has large ears and thick stalks, which can resist wind and avoid damage from rice stem borers. Second, the fertilizers he uses are mainly grass ash (made from decomposed aquatic plants, river mud, pig manure, milk vetch, etc.) and bean cake. These fertilizers are very suitable for the local soil and have the effect of improving the soil. Third, he uses water effectively. To allow the sun to heat the field and promote rice growth, his rice fields only maintain a depth of two inches of water before the rice heads emerge. When the rice heads emerge, he increases the water depth to three inches. After heading, he often irrigates the rice fields at night and drains the water from the rice fields during the day, so that the soil hardens, making it easier for the rice roots to grow firmly and not fall over. In addition, he is also very meticulous in seedling cultivation, transplanting, weeding, and pest control. He cultivates and weeds a total of about five times, ensuring that there is no grass or hard soil in the field each time.
    Recently, Tang Baoming has also formulated a patriotic production plan for 1952. The plan stipulates: next year, he will strive to produce 1,250 jin of rice per mu on 3.8 mu of milk vetch fields, 950 jin of rice per mu on 2 mu of miscellaneous wheat fields, and 900 jin of rice per mu on 10.6 mu of wheat fields. He is determined to actively participate in mutual aid teams, continuously research and improve production techniques, and ensure the complete realization of this plan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏南江阴县劳动模范唐宝铭
    每亩稻田收获一千一百九十九斤
    苏南区江阴县马镇乡劳动模范唐宝铭，在爱国主义的鼓舞下，今年创造了水稻每亩收一千一百九十九斤的纪录。他的丰富的种稻经验已经在江南传扬开来。
    唐宝铭在今年抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动中，生产热情很高。今年五月，他已被评选为江阴县的二等农业劳动模范。当时他在全县劳动模范大会上提出了保证今年每亩稻田产稻一千二百斤的爱国生产计划。经过近半年的努力，他的十六亩五分稻子虽然在八月中旬曾遇到台风的侵袭，但平均每亩仍产九百一十五斤，超过全乡平均产量百分之四十六。其中有三亩三分稻田，每亩产量达到了一千一百九十九斤。
    唐宝铭种稻的经验很丰富：第一，他很注意选种。他种的水稻叫“黄壳早二十日”。为了保持种籽的纯度，三十多年来，他每年或隔年就要穗选一次。这种稻子穗大秆粗，能抗风和避免螟虫为害。第二，他所施用的肥料主要是草塘灰（由水草、河泥、猪粪、红花草等腐熟而成）和豆饼，这些肥料很适宜于当地的土壤，有改良土壤的作用。第三，他用水得法。为了让太阳把田晒热促使稻子生长，在稻子未抽穗以前，他的稻田只保持两寸深的水，当稻子抽穗时，才把水增加到三寸深。抽穗后，他经常在夜里把水灌进稻田，白天又把水放出稻田，使稻田泥土发硬，便于稻根长牢，不易倒伏。此外，他在育苗、插秧、中耕除草、防治害虫等方面也非常精细。他中耕除草总达五遍左右，每遍都要做到田无寸草和硬泥。
    最近，唐宝铭又订出了一九五二年的爱国生产计划。计划规定：明年争取三亩八分红花田每亩产稻一千二百五十斤，二亩多元麦田每亩产稻九百五十斤，十亩六分小麦田每亩产稻九百斤。他决定要积极参加互助组，不断研究和改进生产技术，保证彻底实现这个计划。　（新华社）
