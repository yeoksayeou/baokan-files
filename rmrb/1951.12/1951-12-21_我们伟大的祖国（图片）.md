    Our Great Motherland
    From the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang to the vast rural areas at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, a bumper harvest has been achieved this year. According to incomplete statistics from four special districts: this year's grain output increased by 330 million jin compared to last year, cotton output doubled, and the output of the superior Soviet "3173" cotton variety increased by two times. This is a scene of Uyghur farmers in Koshker Village, Turpan County, Xinjiang, picking cotton in the fields.
