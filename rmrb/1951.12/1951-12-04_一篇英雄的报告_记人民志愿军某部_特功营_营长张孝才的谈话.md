On February 9th, at 6:40 PM, I received an order from the regimental headquarters: Regardless of the enemy's strength or the intensity of their attack, you must block the enemy at the foot of Wuyin Mountain and prevent them from advancing even a single step.

After understanding the overall intent of the campaign and studying the terrain and intelligence, as a commander, I first recognized the military value of Wuyin Mountain, a claw-shaped terrain feature extending into the Hongchuan-Hengcheng highway, in this battle. Because with it, we could have a strong barrier to stop the enemy's advance, allowing our main force to strike the enemy more severely; if the enemy occupied it, they could drive straight in, seize Hongchuan, and put our army in a passive position.

Holding Wuyin Mountain was a glorious task, but also an arduous one. We were only a battalion equipped with light weapons, and here we had to stop the joint offensive of the US Army's 9th Regiment of the 2nd Division, the ROK Army's 8th Division, and the 5th Division.

Braving the heavy snow, I and all the cadres of the battalion surveyed the terrain and felt that to hold Wuyin Mountain, we must control its highest peak, the 500 Height. Obviously, the enemy had already seen this point at this time. They had already occupied the forward position of the 500 Height – the 320 Height – under the cover of the firepower of four howitzer battalions, and covered the 500 Height with intense artillery fire.

The battalion Party committee decided: to recapture the 320 Height. The company commanders of our battalion all asked me: "Let our company go and seize this height!"

When the company commanders talked to me about their plans and determination, I was deeply moved by their high level of courage and wisdom; they supplemented the problems I had not considered, and affirmed the plans I had not fully matured.

After making the decision to recapture the 320 Height, I ordered the 7th Company: "Conceal yourselves along the right side of the 320 Height, approach the enemy secretly, and raid the enemy's position."

It gradually got dark, and the comrades of the 7th Company climbed along the branches towards the 320 Height. When they climbed up the first hill and grabbed the enemy's hair, the enemies were still gathered there, roasting their leather shoes! They then climbed up the second hill, and it wasn't until they reached the front of the enemy's position that the enemy discovered them, but it was too late to resist. A row of our grenades had already been thrown into the enemy's fortifications, and in a burst of deafening noise, the enemies fell one by one. The enemies on the last hill, seeing the situation was not good, automatically retreated.

A colored signal flare was fired on the 320 Height – we had captured this height!

Obviously, our ability to capture the 320 Height was a victory, and it had to be done. But I had already anticipated that with this victory, a brutal battle would soon follow. The gap in time wouldn't even allow us to build fortifications there. So, I ordered the 7th Company: "After occupying the position, don't stop for a minute, immediately modify the enemy's existing fortifications, and be ready to meet the enemy's counterattack at any time." I also sent them a large number of ammunition.

At midnight, only half an hour after we occupied the 320 Height, the enemy's counterattack began as expected. Because it was night, the enemy had some difficulties in coordinating infantry and artillery fire, so they organized continuous infantry charges. Our warriors, guarding in the trenches, held grenades in their hands, and only sent these "rations" out when the enemy approached thirty meters, shouting, "Let you eat something hot!" In this way, they repelled seven consecutive enemy charges. Instructor He Hongxun said humorously: "The enemy's seven charges only got two results: one was 'roll back', and the other was 'can't roll back' (died)."

At dawn, more than twenty enemy planes repeatedly bombed and strafed this small hill until 11 AM. The mountain caught fire, and the fire burned the pine forest, making "cracking" sounds non-stop. There were no more complete fortifications on this hill. Then, under the coordination of various artillery fire, the enemy began to attack this hill again.

7th Company Deputy Commander Cui Futian was wounded, and blood was flowing from his face and arms, but his ever-shouting boke gun never stopped, and enemies fell in piles in front of him.

Political Instructor He Hongxun was wounded, and a bullet pierced his abdomen. He couldn't move. He bit the string of grenades in his mouth, his teeth tightly clenched. At this time, a group of enemies had already walked up to him. He struggled to pull the pins of two grenades together – our comrade He Hongxun – an excellent communist party member, died together with this group of enemies in this way.

The fortifications here had been completely destroyed by the enemy, and daytime was conducive to the enemy's artillery firepower. I ordered the comrades to temporarily evacuate the 320 Height so that it could be captured again at night.

At this time, the enemy had already left more than eighty corpses in front of our position.

The enemy's extending artillery fire constantly hit the bunker of our battalion headquarters, and fine sand flowed down "哗哗" from the cracks in the wood. I and the commanders were studying how to deal with the enemy's superior artillery firepower and reported our situation to the regimental headquarters.

Regiment Commander Jiang said on the phone: "First of all, on behalf of the regimental Party committee, I congratulate all of you comrades on your victory!"

I turned around and told the comrades: "Congratulations to us on our victory!"

The comrades said: "Tell the regimental commander, we will definitely win!"

Then I heard that familiar voice of Regiment Commander Jiang from the phone again: "Your temporary retreat is correct, but remember: the 320 Height cannot be lost, it is the gateway to Wuyin Mountain!"

After studying the characteristics and rules of the enemy's infantry-artillery coordination and artillery-air coordination, we decided to organize a commando team from the 8th Company, with 8th Company Commander Wang Xiheng as the captain, to recapture the 320 Height.

As soon as the commando team was mentioned, the soldiers of the 8th Company all asked to participate, and the 8th Company Commander had to use a designated method to select eighteen people. The commando team set off at 5 PM.

The enemy's artillery fire was shooting aimlessly. At this time, our warriors had already reached the front of the enemy's position.

The warriors each carried many grenades with the lids twisted open and submachine guns loaded with bullets. When these weapons yelled beside the enemy, the enemy panicked and resisted desperately. The enemy's artillery was finished at close range, just standing there like chimneys. Comrade Li Hai took his group and rushed up first. Our submachine guns seemed to be calling names, and the enemies fell in rows.

Finally, on a position, there was still an enemy machine gun hidden in the fortifications firing at us. Communist Party member Liu Wanfa saw that this was a great threat to us, so he climbed along the hiding place to the enemy's side, grabbed the machine gun with one hand, and grabbed the enemy's head with the other, saying, "I'll let you shoot!"

More than sixty enemy corpses and wounded soldiers lay scattered on the position. The 320 Height was back in our hands again.

The enemy was defeated miserably once again. Immediately afterwards, their long-range artillery fire attacked here again. I went to the 320 Height to personally inspect the terrain here and understand the situation here.

I ordered the 8th Company: "Send out a few sentries, concentrate your strength to dig shelter pits near the position, and be sure to complete it before dawn." And I instructed the 8th Company Commander: "These shelter pits must be able to defend against air and artillery attacks, reduce casualties, and must be easy to attack. In a word: you must be able to persist here tomorrow, and not allow the enemy to cross a step!"

The 8th Company Commander understood what I meant and conveyed my order to the soldiers. So, the soldiers started earthwork operations like a charge.

At dawn the next day, the enemy's twelve fighter planes and eight bombers, in coordination with the US Army's 2nd Division howitzer battalion, carried out fire destruction on Wuyin Mountain, and the focus of the artillery fire was the 320 Height.

Shells kept falling on our battalion headquarters, and our bunker was knocked down. The entire 320 Height was on fire, the ice and snow were melting, and flowing down the mountain. The entire hill was burned black.

The enemy really couldn't believe that there would still be living people on the 320 Height; only I knew, and the comrades of the 8th Company who persisted there knew, that the people there were still alive and strong.

From the phone, I asked the 8th Company Commander: "How is it?"

He replied: "It's nothing, only one or two comrades were slightly injured."

"Are you ready?"

"Ready!"

I saw from the binoculars that the enemy's infantry was about to come up. At this time, the enemy's artillery fire turned to our depth. Our warriors jumped out of the trenches and went up to meet them, first throwing a row of grenades, and then raised their submachine guns and rushed to the enemy. The enemies in the front fell, and those behind turned their heads and ran.

"So this is not a 'no-man's land'!" The enemy exchanged dozens of lives for such intelligence.

The enemy's four consecutive collective charges were repelled, so they became angry and concentrated all their artillery fire on the 320 Height. On this position where there was nothing left to burn, a cloud of black smoke enveloped; the gasoline bombs dropped by the enemy planes could only burn on the soil.

Near dusk, the enemy had already left four or five hundred corpses and wounded soldiers in front of our 320 Height, but the enemy was still attacking fiercely. Just as I was sending new troops to reinforce the 8th Company, our main force arrived. Our artillery fire, like overturning mountains and seas, was aimed at the enemy. The enemy was defeated miserably in front of our position.

On Wuyin Mountain, our troops wrote down their infinite loyalty and love to the people, to the motherland, and to the Party with blood and life, wrote down the glory of the Chinese people, and wrote down the name of our "Heroic Troops".

    一篇英雄的报告
    ——记人民志愿军某部“特功营”营长张孝才的谈话
    张志民
    二月九日下午六点四十分钟，我接到团部的命令：不管敌人有多大兵力及其攻击如何猛烈，一定要把敌人堵击在五音山下，不能让他们前进一步。
    当我了解了整个战役的意图，研究了地形和情报之后，作为一个指挥员，我首先认识到了这一座伸在洪川到横城的汽车路上的鸡爪形的五音山在这次战役中的军事价值。因为我们有了它，就可以作为阻止敌人前进的有力屏障，使我们的主力能够更严重地去打击敌人；敌人如果占领了它，就可能长驱直入，占领洪川，陷我军于被动作战的地位。
    扼守五音山是光荣的任务，也是艰巨的任务。我们是仅仅配备有轻型武器的一个营，在这里要阻止住美军第二师第九团、李伪军第八师和第五师的联合进攻。
    冒着大雪，我和全营的干部察看了地形，觉得要扼守五音山，必须要控制它的最高峰五○○高地。显然，这时敌人也已经看到这一点了。他们已在四个榴弹炮营的火力掩护下，占领了五○○高地的前卫——三二○高地，并且用强烈的炮火，把五○○高地掩盖起来了。
    营党委决定：夺回三二○高地。我营各连连长都向我提出请求：“叫我们连去夺这个高地吧！”
    当连长们向我谈到他们的计划和决心时，我为他们高度的勇敢和智慧深深地感动着；他们补充了我所没有考虑到的问题，并且肯定了我没有考虑成熟的计划。
    在下达了夺回三二○高地的决心后，我命令第七连：“沿着三二○高地的右侧，隐蔽着接近敌人，袭取敌人的阵地。”
    天渐渐地黑下来了，七连的同志们攀着树枝，向着三二○高地前进。当他们爬上第一个山头，扭住敌人的头发时，敌人还围在那里烤皮鞋哩！他们接着又爬上了第二个山头，直到他们到达敌人阵地的前沿，敌人才发觉，但是要抵抗已来不及了，我们的一排子手榴弹早已投进了敌人的工事里，在一阵震天的响声中，敌人一个个地倒下去。最后一个山头上的敌人见势不好，就自动地撤退了。
    三二○高地上打起一颗彩色的信号弹——我们把这个高地夺过来了！
    很显然，我们能把三二○高地夺过来，是一个胜利，而且也必须这样做。可是我早已估计到：随着这个胜利，很快要到来的就会是残酷的战斗。这个空隙的时间，甚至不可能让我们在那里筑工事。于是，我命令七连：“占领阵地后，一分钟也不能停，马上改造敌人现有的工事，随时准备迎击敌人的反扑。”我并且派人给他们送去了大批的弹药。
    半夜，我们占领三二○高地才半小时，果然敌人的反扑开始了。因为是夜间，敌人在步兵和炮火的协同上有些困难，所以他们组织了连续的步兵冲锋。我们的勇士们，守在战壕里，攒着手榴弹，直到敌人接近到三十公尺时，才把这些“干粮”送出去，并且喊着：“叫你吃个热火的吧！”就这样，连续打退了敌人的七次冲锋。指导员贺洪勋同志幽默地说：“敌人的七次冲锋只得到了两个结果：一个是‘滚回去’，一个是‘滚不回去’（死了）”。
    天明时，二十多架敌机对这个小山头反复地轰炸、扫射，直到上午十一时才停止。山被打着了火，大火烧得松树林“??啪啪”响个不停。这个山头上再没有一个完整的阵地了。接着，敌人在各种炮火的协同下，又开始向这个山头攻击。
    七连副连长崔福田同志负了伤，他的脸上和臂上鲜血直淌，可是他那支一个劲儿叫的卜壳枪却没停过，敌人在他的面前一堆堆地倒下了。
    政治指导员贺洪勋被打伤，子弹从他的腹部穿过，他不能行动了。他咬着满口的手榴弹弦，牙齿紧闭着。这时一群敌人已走到他的跟前，他挣扎着把两颗手榴弹一起拉响——我们的贺洪勋同志——优秀的共产党员，就这样的和这群敌人同归于尽了。
    这里的工事，已被敌人全部摧毁，而且白天是有利于敌人发挥炮火的威力的。我命令同志们暂时撤离三二○高地，以便夜间再去夺取。
    这时，敌人在我们阵地面前就已经丢下了八十多具尸体。
    敌人延伸射击的炮火，不断地打在我们营指挥所的掩蔽部上，细沙从木头缝里“哗哗”地流下来。我和指挥员们正在研究着如何对付敌人优势炮火的问题，并且向团部报告我们的情况。
    江团长在电话中说：“我首先代表团党委，祝你们全体同志胜利！”
    我反转头来告诉同志们：“祝咱们胜利！”
    同志们说：“告诉团长吧，咱们一定能胜利！”
    接着我又从电话里听到江团长那熟悉的声音：“你们暂时撤退是对的，可是要记住：三二○高地丢不得，那是五音山的门户！”
    我们研究了敌人的步炮协同、炮空协同的特点和规律后，就决定由八连组织突击队，由八连连长王希恒任队长，再去夺取三二○高地。
    一说组织突击队，八连的战士都要求参加，八连长只得用指定的方法，选出十八个人。下午五时突击队出发了。
    敌人的炮火毫无目标地射击着。这时，我们的勇士们已经到达了敌人阵地的前沿。
    勇士们每人带了许多扭开盖子的手榴弹和压满子弹的冲锋枪，当这些武器在敌人身边叫起来的时候，敌人慌乱了，他们绝望地抵抗着。敌人的大炮到了近距离就完蛋了，只像个烟囱似的呆在那儿。李海同志带着他的一组人首先冲了上去，我们的冲锋枪像在点名，敌人一排排地倒下了。
    最后，在一个阵地上，还有敌人的一挺机枪隐蔽在工事里向我们射击。共产党员刘万发看到这对我们威胁很大，就顺着隐蔽地爬到敌人身边，一手抓住机枪，一手揪住敌人的脑袋说：“我叫你打！”
    阵地上横七竖八地躺下了敌人的六十多具死尸和伤员。三二○高地又重新回到我们手里。
    敌人又一次地惨败了。紧接着，他们远距离的炮火，又朝着这里打来。我到了三二○高地上，亲自察看了这里的地形，了解了这里的情况。
    我命令八连：“派出少数警戒，集中力量在阵地附近挖蔽弹坑，天明以前一定要完成。”并且嘱咐八连长：“这种蔽弹坑一则要能防空、防炮、减少伤亡，再则必须便于出击。一句话：明天你们要能在这里坚持，不准敌人跨过一步！”
    八连长明白了我的意思，并向战士们传达我的命令，于是，战士们像冲锋一样地开始了土工作业。
    第二天拂晓，敌人的十二架战斗机、八架轰炸机，协同美军第二师榴弹炮营，对五音山实行火力摧毁，而炮火射击的焦点，就是三二○高地。
    炮弹不断地落到我们营指挥所，我们的掩蔽部被打塌了。整个三二○高地上都燃起了大火，冰雪被融化了，从山上流下来。整个山头被烧得变成了黑色。
    敌人真是不可能相信在三二○高地上还会有活着的人；只有我知道，我们坚持在那里的八连的同志们知道，那里的人还坚强地活着。
    从电话里，我问八连连长：“怎么样呀？”
    他回答说：“没什么，只有一两位同志负了轻伤。”
    “你们准备好了吗？”
    “准备好了！”
    我从望远镜里看到敌人的步兵就要上来了，这时，敌人的炮火转向了我们的纵深，我们的勇士们跳出战壕就迎接上去，先投过一排子手榴弹，接着就端起冲锋枪冲到敌人跟前。最前面的敌人倒下了，后边的扭头就跑。
    “原来这里不是‘无人区’！”敌人用几十条生命的代价，换得了这样一个情报。
    敌人连续四次的集体冲锋都被打退了，因此，他们老羞成怒地集中了所有的炮火，对三二○高地轰击。在这个再也没有东西可以燃烧的阵地上，笼罩着一片黑色的烟尘；敌机扔下的汽油弹，也只能在泥土上燃烧着。
    快到天黑的时候，敌人在我们三二○高地的前沿，已经丢下了四、五百具死尸和伤兵，可是敌人还在继续猛攻，正当我派遣新的兵力去增援八连时，我军的主力来到了，我军的炮火，像排山倒海一样倾向敌人，敌人在我们阵地前面惨败了。
    在五音山上，我们的部队，用鲜血和生命写下了他对人民、对祖国、对党的无限忠心和热爱，写下了中国人民的光荣，写下了我们“英雄部队”的名字。
