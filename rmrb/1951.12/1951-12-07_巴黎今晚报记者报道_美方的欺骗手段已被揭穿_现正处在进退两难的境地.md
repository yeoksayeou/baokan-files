Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: Paris "Ce Soir" reporter Pierre Béguin reported from Panmunjom on December 6th: Since the Korean-Chinese side proposed the prohibition of troop movements and inspection by neutral nations, the U.S. side has not commented on this proposal for four consecutive days. The specific proposals from the Korean-Chinese side seem to have left them breathless. This proposal can truly prevent the concentration of forces, truly reduce the possibility of renewed hostilities, and truly stipulate effective inspection by neutral nations agreed upon by both sides. The fact is, the U.S.'s deceptive tactics have been exposed. They don't know how to conceal their embarrassing situation. The thirty-day deadline is slowly running out, while the U.S. side is raising some naive questions to waste time and delay. They refuse to discuss serious matters. They refuse to comment on the Korean-Chinese side's very constructive proposals. Today, they have put forward eight proposals in addition to their own seven proposals, according to which the armistice agreement will only take effect after the establishment of the armistice commission. But they refuse to clarify whether they accept the principle of inspection by neutral nations. The U.S. representatives insisted on discussing old issues today, wanting to re-discuss the points in their own proposals that the Korean-Chinese side had already agreed to in principle. It seems very clear that they are in a dilemma. They are trying to prevent the world from knowing that what they call "preventing concentration" actually means concentrating enough personnel and materials during the armistice period to launch a large-scale war at the appropriate time. There can be no other explanation for their unwillingness to accept or even comment on the constructive proposals from the Korean-Chinese side.

    美方的欺骗手段已被揭穿
    现正处在进退两难的境地
    【新华社六日讯】法国巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌六日自板门店报道：自从朝中方面提出禁止开进军队并由中立国进行视察的建议以来，美方接连四天没有对这个建议表示意见。朝中方面的具体建议似乎已经使他们停止呼吸了，这个建议可以真正防止集结部队，真正减少敌对行为再起的可能性，真正规定由双方同意的中立国进行有效的视察。事实是，美方的欺骗手段已被揭穿了。他们不知道怎样来掩饰他们的狼狈情况。三十天的时限正慢慢消磨着，而美方却提出一些幼稚的问题来浪费时间，拖延时间。他们拒绝讨论正经事。他们拒绝对朝中方面的很有建设性的建议发表任何意见。今天他们又在他们自己的七点建议之外提出了八点建议，根据这建议，停战协议要在停战委员会成立后才能生效。但他们拒绝说明他们是否接受由中立国进行视察的原则。美方代表今天坚持讨论旧问题，想要再次讨论他们自己建议中的朝中方面已在原则上同意的各点。看起来很清楚，他们已处于进退两难的境地。他们想设法不让世界知道他们所说的“防止集结”的意思，实际是要在停战期间集结足够的人员和物资，以便在适当的时候发动大规模的战争。对于他们不愿意接受或甚至不愿意评论朝中方面的建设性建议一点，不可能有别的解释。
