Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Great progress has been made in the past year on the great communist construction projects being carried out on a large scale in the Soviet Union.

The construction of the Volga-Don Canal is nearing completion. This project includes the 101-kilometer-long navigable canal connecting the Volga and Don rivers, and the Tsimlyansk hydropower project in the lower reaches of the Don. Of the thirteen locks being built on the navigable canal, seven are nearing completion. The concrete pouring work has been completed, and many dams, reservoirs, and pumping stations have been finished. Workers are now assembling strong, automatically operated water gates and other equipment. In the main project of the canal—the Tsimlyansk hydropower project area—dozens of lock projects were completed in June. Construction workers have successfully excavated a new riverbed for the Don, and the construction of a large 13-kilometer-long earth dam across the Don is nearing completion. In order to complete the project ahead of schedule, construction workers are piling up the dam at a rate of 60 centimeters per day, breaking the convention of the world hydraulic engineering community's highest daily dam piling of 35 centimeters. By the time of the spring flood next year, the world's largest artificial reservoir, the "Tsimlyansk Sea," will appear near the earth dam. This reservoir will make the Don a deep-water navigable waterway, drive the generators of the Tsimlyansk hydropower station, and benefit 2.75 million hectares (equivalent to 41.25 million mu) of land in the Rostov and Stalingrad regions with irrigation and water supply.

Important foundation projects have been completed this year on the world's largest hydropower stations to be completed in 1955 and 1956—the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station. At the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, workers have successfully excavated the foundation of the power plant on the right bank of the Volga River. In order to reduce the flow velocity so as to build an embankment on the foundation of the power plant, workers have completed the project of piling stones on the riverbed. On the left bank of the Volga River, workers erected a 100-kilometer-long high-voltage power line in August, connecting Kuibyshev City and the construction site, and excavation of the downstream lock has begun. Construction workers excavated more than 1.7 million cubic meters of earth in a very short time. They piled 1 million cubic meters of mud into a water-repellent weir and built a 16-meter-high, 4-kilometer-long embankment to protect the foundation of the downstream lock. Huge cement factories and many other subsidiary enterprises have been established at the construction site. A beautiful city is being built near the hydropower station. At the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, construction workers completed the annual plan for the construction and assembly of auxiliary enterprises in August and are preparing to complete the next year's plan by the end of this year. Workers have begun to build the water-repellent weir of the hydropower station and a 600-kilometer-long irrigation canal (this hydropower station will irrigate 13 million hectares, equivalent to 195 million mu, of land after completion). By the end of this year, the total amount of earthwork will reach 4 million cubic meters, and more than 1,000 tons of metal plates will be sunk into the bottom layer of the water-repellent weir. In addition, a section of railway line and a section of highway have been built on the lock, and a workers' town has been built on the left bank of the Volga River.

The longest canal in the contemporary world, the 1,100-kilometer-long Turkmen Main Canal, which will be completed in 1957, has undergone route reconnaissance this year, and surveys on agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, horticulture, etc., have been carried out in the vast irrigation area of the canal. The topographic survey teams, starting from both ends of the Kara Kum Desert, met in the desert in August. The reconnaissance team, composed of geologists, topographers, soil and forest scientists, has completed the reconnaissance work in the West Turkmen Desert area, and the drawings of the Turkmen Main Canal will be made based on the reports of the reconnaissance team. While the survey work is in progress, preparations for the main project are also being carried out at the canal construction site. At the starting point of the canal, Takhta-Tash, many docks have been built, and the second power station has been completed. Auxiliary enterprises, new railways, and highways are now under construction.

In the past year, two auxiliary power stations have been built at the construction site of the Kakhovka Hydropower Station on the Dnieper River (scheduled for completion in 1956). High-voltage power lines are now being erected to the construction site, and new railways, highways, and apartment buildings are under construction. For the South Ukraine and North Crimean Canals, scheduled to be completed in 1957, hundreds of scientists and workers have conducted reconnaissance work on the main lines of the canal and in the irrigation areas along the lines this year. They have surveyed more than 1,000 square kilometers of land in South Ukraine and dug more than 600 test pits to investigate the geological conditions to determine the canal route. Preparations are now underway along the canal to begin construction of hydropower stations, embankments, and locks next year. 15,000 train cars of equipment and construction materials have been transported to the construction site. More than 700 workers are receiving special technical training in preparation for the glorious task of construction.

    苏联共产主义建设工程一年来有很大进展
    伏尔加河—顿河运河的通航河道和齐姆良水利工程将近完成
    古比雪夫水电站等世界最大水电站今年已完成重要基础工程
    【新华社二十六日讯】苏联大规模进行的伟大的共产主义建设工程，一年来已有了很大的进展。
    伏尔加河—顿河运河的建设工程已将近完成。这一项工程包括连接伏尔加河与顿河的全长一百零一公里的通航运河，和顿河下游的齐姆良水利工程。在通航运河上兴建的十三道水闸，已有七道接近完成。浇灌水泥的工程已经竣工，许多堤坝、水库和抽水站已经完成。现在工人们正在装配坚固的自动操纵的水门和其他设备。在运河主要工程——齐姆良水利工程地带，数十段水闸工程已经在六月间完成。建筑工人已胜利地开凿了顿河的一段新河床，横跨顿河的长达十三公里的大土堤的工程即将完工。为了提前完成工程计划，建筑工人每天堆堤高达六十公分，打破了世界水力技术工程界每天最高堆堤三十五公分的陈规。到明年春汛时期，土堤附近将出现世界上最大的人工水库——“齐姆良海”。这个水库将使顿河成为深水通航的河道，将推动齐姆良水电站的发电机，并使罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒两州二百七十五万公顷（合四千一百二十五万市亩）的土地得到灌溉和供水之利。
    将在一九五五和一九五六年修成的世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站，今年都完成了重要的基础工程。在古比雪夫水电站的工地，工人们已在伏尔加河右岸胜利地进行了挖掘电力厂地基的工作。为了减低水流速度以便在电力厂地基上建筑堤堰，工人们已完成了在河底上堆砌石块的工程。在伏尔加河左岸，工人们已在八月间架设了一百公里长的高压电线，把古比雪夫城和工地连接起来，下游水闸的挖掘工作已经开始。建筑工人在很短的时间内挖了一百七十多万土方。他们把一百万公方的泥土堆成拒水堰，并且建立了一道十六公尺高四公里长的堤堰，以保护下游水闸的基础。巨大的水泥工厂和其他许多附属企业已在工地建立起来。水电站附近正在建立一座美丽的城市。在斯大林格勒水电站工地，建筑工人在八月间完成了全年建筑和装配辅助企业的计划以后，准备在今年年底以前完成下一年度的计划。工人们已开始建造水电站的拒水堰和长六百多公里的灌溉运河
    （这个水电站完成后，将灌溉一千三百万公顷，合一亿九千五百万市亩的土地）。到今年年底，土工总量将达四百万土方，将有一千多吨金属板沉入拒水堰的底层。此外在水闸上已经建筑了一段铁路线和一段公路线，在伏尔加河左岸已兴建起一座工人的城镇。
    将在一九五七年修成的当代世界最长的运河——全长一千一百公里的土库曼大运河，今年已进行了线路的勘察工作，并在运河的广大灌溉区进行了关于农业、畜牧、造林、园艺等方面的调查工作。由卡拉·库姆沙漠两端出发的地形测量队，八月间已在沙漠中会合。由地质学家、地形学家、土壤和森林学家组成的勘察队，已完成了在西土库曼沙漠地带进行的勘察工作，土库曼大运河的图样将根据勘察队的各项报告制成。和勘测工作进行同时，运河工地上也进行了主要工程的准备工作。在运河的起点塔赫亚·塔什，许多码头已经建造起来，第二动力站已经竣工。现在正在建筑辅助企业、新的铁路和公路。
    一年来在第聂伯河上的卡霍夫卡水电站（预定一九五六年完工）的工地上已建立了两个辅助电力站，现在正向工地架设高压电线、新的铁路、公路和公寓房屋正在建筑中。预定在一九五七年修好的南乌克兰和北克里米亚运河，今年有数百科学家和工人在运河的主要干线和沿线灌溉地区进行了勘察工作。他们在南乌克兰已测量了一千多平方公里的地区，挖了六百多个调查地层情况的试验竖坑，以测定运河线路。现在运河沿线正在进行准备工作，以便在明年开始建造水电站、堤堰和水闸。一万五千火车皮的设备和建筑材料已经运到工地。七百多工人正在受特殊技术训练，准备迎接建筑工程的光荣任务。
