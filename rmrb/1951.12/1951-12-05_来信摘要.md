Letter Summary

Cotton farmers in Wu Huayuan Village, Gaotang County, Pingyuan Province,
Actively sell cotton and no longer "build platforms" to hoard cotton

Before the land reform, most of the cotton fields in Wu Huayuan Village, Gaotang County, Pingyuan Province, were controlled by landlords and rich peasants. Every year after the new cotton came down, they would specially clean up a room, spread mats and straw mats to build platforms, put the picked flowers on them, hoard them, and move them when they needed money or when the cotton price rose. After the land reform, farmers planted more cotton, and many people followed this method, building platforms to hoard cotton to wait for high prices.

This year, when the government called for the sale and storage of cotton, the cotton farmers understood a principle: If it weren't for the People's Government helping to control insect pests and floods, there would be no good harvest this year. Therefore, they unanimously expressed: Sell the cotton to the state as soon as it is harvested, and no longer "build platforms." Everyone also included this in the patriotic pact.	Yin Chengyi

Wuhu City People's Cultural Center studies and improves
Single-line broadcasting to meet people's needs

The wired broadcasting of the Wuhu City People's Cultural Center has been welcomed by citizens, who have repeatedly requested to add loudspeakers and expand the broadcasting coverage. However, the People's Government has limited funds, and the City People's Cultural Center cannot purchase a large number of insulated wires to add more loudspeakers. The entire team of the film crew of the center, in order to meet the needs of the people, discussed and studied the trial use of single-line broadcasting with radio professionals in Wuhu City to overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds. After many studies, it was found that using underground tap water pipes as current conductors can make the sound of single-line broadcasting loud and clear. Now the city has added four loudspeakers, saving a total of 8,000 yards of insulated wire, equivalent to approximately 21 million yuan in Renminbi.	Wu Yunxing

Film projection team welcomed by migrant workers at the Huai River construction site

Since the start of the Huai River project in Henan Province this winter, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions film projection team has been warmly welcomed by migrant workers at the construction site. All migrant workers of the Fifth Brigade of Queshan County, Banqiao Reservoir, wrote to them saying: "After watching the films 'Heroes of Lüliang' and 'Daughters of China', we immediately thought of the aggressive atrocities of the Japanese devils, and American imperialism is now following this old path. We will never allow it. Now we have all made plans to increase production and donate, donating 10% of our wages every month, and also donating three loads of earth every day. We have launched a patriotic competition movement to resolutely ensure the completion of the Huai River." In addition to showing movies, the projection team also photographed and enlarged various scenes of the migrant workers' work, and held photo exhibitions at the construction site. When the migrant workers saw the various scenes of their most familiar work, life, and study, especially when they saw themselves, they were so happy that they danced and expressed that they would work harder to complete the Huai River.

Worker Cao Chunrong returned the huge sum of money he found
returned it to the owner intact

Cao Chunrong, a cotton ginning worker from Dongguanwai Street, Chengguan District, Shan County, Pingyuan Province, went to his relatives' house to deliver gifts on the afternoon of July 19th in the lunar calendar this year. He found a large package on the road six or seven miles south of Shan County. The package was full of bundles of Renminbi. He remembered that two comrades riding bicycles had passed by earlier. He carried the large package and chased after them along the road. After running for more than two miles, he finally saw their shadows. He shouted loudly, asking the two comrades to stop. He returned the money to the two comrades intact. The two comrades were from the Huanggangji Exchange and had just received the money from the Huxi Grain Branch. They were very grateful to Cao Chunrong. Afterwards, the Huanggang Exchange presented Cao Chunrong with a banner and gifts for this matter. This matter spread quickly, and the people of Shan County all knew about it. The masses expressed that they would learn from Cao Chunrong's patriotism and new morality.	Dai Ming

Niu Guilin of the Transportation Section of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region
Assaulting district cadres should be punished

October 25th was the anniversary of the Volunteer Army's departure for the war. On this day, Guo Xiang, Minister of the Armed Forces Department of the Fourth District of Xuanhua County, went to Huashaoying Town to participate in a mass celebration meeting. In the afternoon, Guo Xiang went to the roof of resident Tian Zhaonian's house to notify the masses to attend the meeting. Unexpectedly, Xun, the section chief of the Transportation Section of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, and staff member Niu Guilin were living in Tian Zhaonian's house. When the two of them heard someone shouting on the roof, they came out and scolded without asking questions. Guo Xiang asked them which unit they belonged to and explained that he was notifying the masses to attend the meeting on the roof. Niu Guilin's attitude was very tough, and he reached out to snatch the gun. When Niu Guilin failed to snatch the gun, he slapped Guo Xiang in the face, hitting him for more than twenty minutes, swelling Guo Xiang's face. Section Chief Xun didn't express any attitude below. As far as we know, Niu Guilin has assaulted people more than once. We suggest that the relevant departments give Niu Guilin appropriate punishment. Section Chief Xun should also make a review.

Some rural cadres in Linxiang County
Ideological paralysis caused losses in work

After the land reform in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, some cadres became ideologically paralyzed and could not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, causing great losses to their work. Village cadres of Kantou Village, Diba Township, Ninth District, invited landlord Zhou Liusheng to be their secretary, on the grounds that: "The land reform has been completed, and landlords can also participate in revolutionary work." Zhou Liusheng was also called to be the chairman when the village held meetings, and Zhou Shouqing, chairman of the Township Farmers Association, also introduced Zhou Liusheng as a propagandist. Li Xiongbin, a cadre in the Seventh District, married the daughter of Yu Zechun, the former secretary of the Kuomintang Linxiang County Party Department, and was fooled by the enemy's honey trap. These have caused losses to the work. There are many similar phenomena. I hope the leading organs will educate the above-mentioned cadres so that they can be vigilant ideologically.

    来信摘要
    平原省高唐县武花园村棉农
    积极售棉不再“搭铺”囤棉
    平原省高唐县武花园村在土地改革前，大部棉田被地主富农所掌握。每年新棉下来后，他们就专门收拾一间房，铺上箔和席搭上铺，把摘的花放上去，囤起来，等用钱或棉价高涨时再动它。土地改革后，农民种棉花多了，不少人就沿用这种办法，搭起铺将棉花囤起来等大价钱。
    今年政府号召售、储棉花时，棉农们却明白了一个道理：要不是人民政府帮助治虫灾、水灾，今年就不会有好的收成。因此一致表示：收下棉花就快卖给国家，不再“搭铺”了。大家并把这一条订到爱国公约上。    尹承伊
    芜湖市人民文化馆研究改进
    单线广播满足人民要求
    芜湖市人民文化馆的有线广播，受到了市民的欢迎，他们曾屡次要求增设喇叭，扩大广播面。可是人民政府经费有限，市人民文化馆不能购买大量的皮线，增设更多的喇叭。该馆电影工作队全体同志，为了满足人民要求，和芜湖市无线电专业人员一起商讨、研究试用单线广播，以克服经费不足的困难。经过多次的研究后，发现利用地下自来水管做电流导体，可使单线广播的声音大而清楚。现该市增设了喇叭四处，共节省皮线八千码，约合人民币两千一百万元。    吴运兴
    电影放映队在治淮工地受到民工欢迎
    今冬河南省治淮工程动工后，全国总工会电影放映队在工地受到民工热烈欢迎。板桥水库确山县第五中队全体民工写信给他们说：“我们看了‘吕梁英雄传’和‘中华女儿’影片后，马上想到日本鬼子的侵略暴行，美国帝国主义现在又走这条老路，我们决不允许。现在我们都订了计划，增产捐献，每人每月要捐工资百分之十，另外每天还捐三挑土。我们已展开爱国主义的竞赛运动，坚决保证把淮河修好。”放映队除了放映电影之外，还把工地民工工作的各种场面加以摄影放大，在工地举行照片展览。当民工们看到自己最熟悉的工作、生活、学习等各种场面，尤其是看到自己本人的时候，都高兴得手舞足蹈，表示要更努力工作，把淮河修好。    黄石奇
    工人曹春荣把拾到的巨款原封
    归还了失主
    平原省单县城关区东关外街弹花工人曹春荣，今年夏历七月十九日下午到亲戚家去送礼，在单县城南六、七里路的大路上拾到一个大包袱。包袱里都是一捆捆的人民币。他记起前面曾过去两个骑自行车的同志。他扛起大包袱，顺着马路就往前面追。跑了二里多路，才算看到了影。他大声喊着，让那两个同志停下来。他把钱原封交给了那两个同志。那两个同志是黄岗集交易所的，刚从湖西粮食分公司领了钱回来。他们十分感激曹春荣。事后，黄岗交易所为此事赠送了曹春荣锦旗一面，还送了礼物。这事一传十、十传百，单县全城群众都知道了，群众纷纷表示要学习曹春荣的爱国精神和新道德。    戴鸣
    华北军区后勤部运输科牛贵林
    殴打区干部应受处分
    十月二十五日，是志愿军出国一周年纪念日。这天，宣化县第四区武装部部长郭祥到化稍营镇参加群众庆祝大会。下午，郭祥到居民田照年的房上通知群众开会。却不知华北军区后勤部运输科的勋科长、科员牛贵林正住在田照年家。他们两人听见房上有人叫喊，不问青红皂白，走出来就骂。郭祥问他们是那一部分的，并解释说他是在房上通知群众开会。牛贵林却态度十分强硬，伸手就要夺枪。牛贵林夺枪不成，便打郭祥的耳光，一连打了二十多分钟，把郭祥的脸都打肿了。勋科长在下面一直也没有表示态度。据我们所知，牛贵林打人已不止这一次。我们建议有关部门给牛贵林以适当处分。勋科长也应作检讨。

    临湘县某些农村干部
    思想麻痹使工作遭受到损失
    湖南省临湘县经过土地改革以后，有一些干部思想麻痹，敌我不分，使工作受到很大损失。九区圫坝乡墈头村村干部请地主周留生当他们的秘书，理由是：“土地改革完成了，地主也可以参加革命工作”。村里开会时还叫周留生当主席，该乡农民协会主席周寿清并介绍周留生当宣传员。七区干部李雄斌和前国民党临湘县党部书记余泽春的女儿结婚，上了敌人的美人计的当。这些都使工作受到了损失。类似现象还很多。我希望领导机关对上述干部进行教育，使他们从思想上警惕起来。
