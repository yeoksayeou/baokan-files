Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, December 18th: This reporter reports: Soldiers from the U.S., Britain, and other countries are increasingly eager to end the war before Christmas. According to American soldier Jordan, who was recently captured, soldiers in their unit are clamoring like a tidal wave, demanding that the American negotiators stop playing tricks and end this war before December 25th. Jordan gave an example to illustrate how eagerly American soldiers hope to go home for Christmas. He said that in early November, he and nine other soldiers were sent out on a reconnaissance mission. They had just climbed halfway up a mountain when five of them were wounded by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's machine guns. At that moment, one of the wounded soldiers suddenly burst out laughing and said, "Wish you all the same good luck as me, I can go home for Christmas!"

Another American prisoner, Pinagli, said that in his unit, even the company and platoon leaders told the soldiers directly: "Fighting this dirty war is too boring. Let's have a ceasefire quickly so we can go home and have a happy Christmas." The discussions among the soldiers were even more intense. Pinagli cursed, "Our American tycoons can dance with girls and drink happily during Christmas, but they leave us damned soldiers in the freezing cold of Korea."

British prisoner Cowey said that when British soldiers stood on the snowy mountains wearing winter clothes, they all cursed the American negotiators for messing things up. When Cowey heard the news that the U.S. side had refused to discuss the principle proposed by our representatives regarding the swift repatriation of all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement, he angrily cursed: "To hell with it, what good intentions do the Americans have? They just want to use this issue to play tricks. If British soldiers were the representatives, then we could have a ceasefire and go home for Christmas in a few days."

　　反对美方谈判代表再耍鬼把戏
    美英士兵渴望早日停战回家
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】本社记者报道：美英等国士兵愈来愈渴望在圣诞节前结束战争，据不久前被俘的美国士兵乔登供说，在他们的部队里，士兵们正象浪涛般地喧嚷着，要求美国的谈判代表不要再玩什么鬼把戏，要在十二月二十五日前结束这个战争。乔登举了一个例子来说明美国士兵们怎样迫切地希望在圣诞节时能回家。他说，十一月初，他和另外九个士兵被派出去侦察，刚爬到一座山的半腰就被志愿军的机关枪打伤了五个。正在这个时刻，有一个受伤的士兵忽然哈哈大笑起来，他说：“祝你们也有象我这样的好运气吧，我可以回家去过圣诞节了！”
    另一个美国俘虏品格里说，在他的部队里，甚至连长、排长也向士兵当面讲：“打这个肮脏的战争太无聊了，赶快停战，好回家去过快活的圣诞节。”在士兵们中间，谈论就更厉害了。品格里咒骂说：“我们的美国大亨们过圣诞节时可以搂着姑娘跳舞，痛快地喝酒，却把我们这些该死的士兵留在朝鲜的冰天雪地里。”
    英军俘虏考维说，当英国的士兵们穿着冬服站在风雪交加的山岭上时，他们都大骂美国的谈判代表在胡捣蛋。当考维听说美方拒绝讨论我方代表提出的关于双方在停战协议签字后迅速遣送全部俘虏的原则的消息时，他愤怒地骂了起来：“去他妈的，美国人会有什么好心眼？他只是想借这个问题来玩弄花样。假使由我们英国的士兵来当代表，那么，不用几天就可以停战回家去过圣诞节了。”
