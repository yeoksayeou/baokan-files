Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 19th: Our special correspondent reports: At 3 p.m. on the 18th, the Korean-Chinese side handed a complete and sufficient set of prisoner of war information to the American side, and accepted the information submitted by the other side. Our side believes that discussions on the principles of prisoner release can now proceed, but the other side believes that it needs time to study the information and proposed that the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee adjourn until it can reconvene "when both sides have completed their studies." Because the other side believed that it needed time to study the information, our side agreed to their proposal to adjourn.

Since our side accepted the other side's request to simultaneously hold discussions in the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee on the 11th of this month, our representatives have from the beginning put forward the basic principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement, and then put forward five specific proposals concerning the arrangement of prisoners. However, because the other side insisted on its unreasonable preconditions, demanding that prisoner information be exchanged first and then the principles be discussed, the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee was delayed for eight days without any progress. In order to break the stalemate in the meeting and eliminate the other side's excuse for delaying the meeting, and to promote the smooth development of the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee, our side made another major effort to agree to the other side's request and handed over information on American and Syngman Rhee army prisoners to the other side on the afternoon of the 18th.

The prisoner information that our side handed over to the other side was truly complete and sufficient. The list of prisoners opened by our side included not only prisoners from the Syngman Rhee puppet army, but also prisoners from the United States and its vassal states of Great Britain, Turkey, the Philippines, France, Australia, the Union of South Africa, Canada, Greece, and the Netherlands; in addition, it also included three prisoners, Yoshi Otani, Kiyoto Tsutsui (transliteration), and Tatsufumi Yasui, from defeated Japan, who were illegally used by the United States. This list of prisoners included all the prisoners detained by the Korean-Chinese side, who the Korean-Chinese side are prepared to promptly release and repatriate after the signing of the armistice agreement. Among these prisoners are captured soldiers and officers from the United States, Great Britain, and other countries, as well as American generals who have gone missing, such as Major General Dean, the commander of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, who was found by the Korean People's Army. It also included three prisoners, Park Deok-gi, Park Rae-ryang, and Kim Bong-deuk, armed personnel of the Syngman Rhee puppet army who were involved in the nine ground attack incidents in the Kaesong neutral zone during the Korean armistice talks. The above-mentioned information that our side handed over to the other side listed in detail the name, military number, unit number, rank, and prisoner of war camp of each prisoner, and the names of prisoners from various countries were also written in the language of each country.

Opening the information submitted by the other side, all that was provided was what were called prisoners' names spelled in English and prisoner numbers compiled by the other side; nothing else was included. This kind of information is almost worthless, because it is very difficult to verify based on Korean-Chinese names spelled in English without any other material. Since the day the two sides' delegations held a meeting on November 27, the US side has proposed exchanging prisoner information. Since the establishment of the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee, the other side has even unreasonably insisted on the unreasonable demand that there would be no further discussion without exchanging information, and repeatedly said at the meeting every day that they had prepared complete and sufficient information. In the past two days, the other side has even carried their so-called "complete and sufficient information" into and out of the conference tent, insisting that the Korean-Chinese side exchange information. Now that the Korean-Chinese side has produced truly complete and sufficient information for exchange, in order to break the stalemate and solve the problem, the US side has handed over such a pile of waste paper-like information that cannot help solve the problem. The people of the world and the prisoners of war in the Korean War will understand from this: How ridiculous and deceitful are the so-called humanitarian principles and concern for the welfare of prisoners, and not to mention the sincerity of achieving a Korean armistice as soon as possible, spoken of by American representatives.

Now that the Korean-Chinese side has handed over a truly complete and sufficient set of information, what will the American side do? The American representatives said: The list of prisoners in Korean and Chinese will be submitted on December 25th, and if the unit numbers and ranks of the prisoners need to be listed for the Korean-Chinese side, then more time is required. People want to ask: How long will this continue to be delayed? In any case, the people of the world have found an answer here: who is seriously and responsibly seeking an early agreement at the meeting, and who is perfunctorily and deliberately delaying the meeting.

    新华社记者评述双方交换俘虏资料经过
    我方交出完整而充分的资料以期打开僵局
    美方资料如同废纸敷衍塞责故意拖延会议
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：十八日下午三时，朝中方面以一份完整而充分的俘虏资料交给美国方面；并接受了对方交来的资料，我方认为即可进行讨论释放俘虏原则，但对方认为需要时间研究，提议第四项议程小组委员会休会到
    “双方研究完毕时”复会，由于对方认为需要时间研究，我方同意其休会提议。
    自从本月十一日我方接受对方要求同时举行讨论第四项议程的小组委员会以来，我方代表一开始就提出了在停战协议签字后迅速释放和遣送全体战俘的基本原则，接着又提出了有关俘虏安排问题的五项具体建议。但是，由于对方坚持其无理的先决条件，要首先交换俘虏资料然后讨论原则问题，使第四项议程小组委员会拖延了八天而毫无进展。我方为了打破会议的僵局并扫除对方拖延会议的藉口，促进第四项议程小组委员会的顺利发展，特再作一次重大努力，答应对方的要求，于十八日下午将美、李军俘虏资料交给对方。
    我方交给对方的俘虏资料，是名符其实地完整而充分的。在我方开列的俘虏名单中，除李承晚伪军的俘虏外，还包括美国及其仆从国英国、土耳其、菲律宾、法国、澳大利亚、南非联邦、加拿大、希腊及荷兰等国军队的俘虏；此外，也包括为美国非法利用的战败国日本的谷山义男、筒井清人（译音）、安井龙文等三名俘虏。这个俘虏名单包括了朝中方面所拘押的全部俘虏，他们是朝中方面准备在停战协议签字后即迅速予以释放和遣送的。在这些俘虏中，包括美、英等国被俘的士兵和军官，也包括美国失踪的将军、如为朝鲜人民军清查出来的美军第二十四师师长迪安将军。此外也包括与朝鲜停战谈判会议开城中立区九次地面袭击事件有关的李承晚伪军武装人员朴德基、朴来良、金凤得等三名俘虏。我方交给对方的上述资料详尽地开列了各该俘虏的姓名、军人号码、部队番号、级别、所在俘虏营等，各国俘虏的名字并均以各该国文字写明。
    翻开对方交来的资料一看，除了以英文拼写的所谓俘虏的名字和对方自编的俘虏编号外，其他一无所有。这种资料几乎是毫无价值的，因为根据用英文拼出的朝中姓名而没有其他材料，是很难查对的。从十一月二十七日双方代表团举行会议那天起，美方即提出要交换俘虏资料，而自第四项议程小组委员会成立以来，对方更无理地坚持不交换资料就不讨论下去的横蛮要求，并在会上天天说他们已准备好完整而充分的资料。最近两天，对方甚至把他们这个所谓“完整而充分的资料”从会议帐篷提进提出，坚持要朝中方面交换资料，现在等到朝中方面拿出真正完整而充分的资料来交换，以期打开僵局、解决问题时，美方又交出这样一堆不能帮助解决问题的废纸似的资料。全世界的人民以及朝鲜战争中的俘虏们将从这里了解：美国代表口中的什么人道主义原则，什么关心俘虏的福利等等，是何等可笑的欺人之谈，更不用说早日实现朝鲜停战的诚意了。
    朝中方面既然交出了一份真正完整而充分的资料，那么美国方面将怎么办呢？美国代表说：十二月二十五日将交出朝文和中文的俘虏名单，如果要向朝中方面开列俘虏所属部队番号和级别，则要更多的时间。人们要问：这究竟要继续拖多久呢？无论如何，全世界的人民已从这里找到了一个答案，就是：究竟是谁在认真而负责地求取会议早日达成协议，是谁在敷衍塞责故意拖延会议。
