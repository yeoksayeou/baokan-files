To Respected Chairman Mao:
    Since responding to your call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which requires increasing production and practicing strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," the patriotic enthusiasm of all our factory workers has been even more heightened. We convened a workers' representative conference on November 10th and 11th, and the conference resolved: "In addition to ensuring the completion of the winter shock production tasks, we will raise the original plan to increase production and conserve more than 25,000 tons of grain to 40,000 tons by the end of the year."

    Under the correct leadership of the Party, all our workers immediately took action, revised the patriotic pact, launched a vigorous and comprehensive red flag competition for excellent products, and promoted the Hao Jianxiu and Liu Xiuying work methods. From workshops to groups, from departments to canteens, dormitories, and nurseries, everyone worked very hard. In the past month, the entire factory has undergone a new transformation, and production efficiency has generally improved. Our yarn factory exceeded the state production plan by 25.3 percent in October, exceeding the task of increasing production and conservation by 0.99 percent; the cloth factory exceeded the task of increasing production and conservation by 20.99 percent. Because we actively studied and overcame various difficulties, and vigorously tapped potential strengths, to date, incomplete statistics show that we have found more than 140 large and small tricks and inventions, and many advanced workshops, teams, groups, and model figures have emerged. For example, the female winder Liu Xiuying, concerned about national wealth, improved her operating methods and saved the country 75 tons of grain a year. Wang Qingping eliminated the waste rate of winding thread, saving the country 108 tons of grain a year. We also produced 52 Hao Jianxiu-style workers and 44 Liu Xiuying-style workers, as well as 44 advanced groups. These are all our good examples.

    Respected Chairman Mao: You will be happy to hear that we have now victoriously completed the year's production tasks 20 days ahead of schedule.

    Today, all our workers held a victory celebration rally with great excitement. At this meeting, we summarized our experiences and rewarded many models.

    Respected Chairman Mao: All our workers would like to express to you: Although we have achieved the above results, we will never be arrogant or complacent. In the future, we will more humbly learn advanced experiences, create new production operating procedures, and use our working class's practical actions on the production front to more vigorously support our most beloved people - the Chinese People's Volunteers, and vigorously supply military and civilian needs, and strive to complete the glorious task of increasing production and saving 40,000 tons of grain in our factory by the end of the year.

    向毛主席保证努力增产节约
    锦州纺织厂职工保证到年底增产节约四万吨粮食敬爱的毛主席：自从响应您在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上发出的“继续加强抗美援朝工作，需要增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召以来，我们全厂职工爱国热情更加高涨。我们在十一月十日、十一日召开了职工代表大会，会议决议：“保证完成冬季突击生产任务外，并到年底把原来增产节约两万五千多吨粮食的计划提高到四万吨。”
    我们全体职工在党的正确领导下，立即行动起来，修订了爱国公约，展开了轰轰烈烈的全面的优良产品红旗竞赛，推广了郝建秀、刘秀英工作法。从车间到小组，从科室到食堂、宿舍、托儿所，每个人都非常努力。一个月以来，全厂面貌一新，生产效率普遍提高。我们的纱厂在十月份曾超过国家生产计划百分之二五·三，超过增产节约任务百分之○·九九；布场超过增产节约任务百分之二○·九九。由于我们积极钻研，克服了各种困难，大力地挖掘了潜在力量，到目前不完全的统计，已找到大小窍门和发明创造一百四十多起，并涌现出不少先进车间、班、小组和模范人物。如筒子机女工刘秀英，关心国家财富，改进了操作方法，一年给国家节省七十五吨粮食。王清萍消灭编线回丝率，一年可给国家节省一百零八吨粮食。又产生了五十二名郝建秀式工作者和四十四名刘秀英式工作者，四十四个先进小组。这些都是我们的好榜样。
    敬爱的毛主席：您听到一定会高兴，我们现在提前二十天胜利地完成了全年生产任务。
    今天我们全体职工怀着极兴奋的心情，召开了祝捷大会。在这会上，总结了经验，并奖励了很多模范。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们全体职工向您表示：我们虽然有了以上成绩，但我们决不骄傲自满，我们今后要更虚心地学习先进经验，创造新的生产操作规程，以我们工人阶级在生产战线上的实际行动，更有力地支援我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军，并大力供给军需民用，为到年底完成我厂增产节约四万吨粮食的光荣任务而奋斗。锦州纺织厂全体职工
