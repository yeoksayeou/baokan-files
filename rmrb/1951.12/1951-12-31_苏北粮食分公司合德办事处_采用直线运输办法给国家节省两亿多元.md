    He De Office of the Northern Jiangsu Grain Branch Saves the Country Over 200 Million Yuan by Adopting Straight-Line Transportation
    Editor: The He De Office of the China Grain Company's Northern Jiangsu Branch has saved the country over 200 million yuan in the past three months by adopting straight-line transportation methods. In May of last year, this company was ordered to establish an office in Hede Town, Sheyang County. At that time, when transferring and supplying grain, the grain was first transported to Hede Town, and then distributed by the Hede Town Office to the business offices and various sales agencies. Therefore, commodity circulation costs were high. This year, all employees, through the patriotic labor competition, have initially improved business management and strengthened the economic accounting system. This autumn, when purchasing and storing cotton and supplying grain, they made plans in advance and set up a supply station in Chenyang Town, adopting a straight-line transportation method. For example, grain from Yancheng, Jianhu, Yilin, and other places, after being transported to Chenyang Station, was directly sent to the business offices and various sales cooperatives. In this way, an average of 270 catties of rice are saved for every 10,000 catties of grain in transportation, loading and unloading, and losses. From September to November this year, a total of 10,430,000 catties of rice and wheat were transferred from Yancheng, Jianhu, Yilin, and other places. Except for 2,864,000 catties transported to Hede, the rest were transported directly to the business offices and various sales agencies using the straight-line transportation method. A total of 7,561,000 catties of grain were transported, saving an expenditure of more than 200,410 catties of rice. Calculated at 999 yuan per catty, this office saved the country over 200 million yuan.                            Chen Bin

    苏北粮食分公司合德办事处
    采用直线运输办法给国家节省两亿多元
    编辑同志：中国粮食公司苏北分公司合德办事处，采用直线运输办法，三个月来，共给国家节省两亿多元。去年五月间，这个公司奉令在射阳县合德镇成立办事处。当时调运供应粮时，都是先把粮食运到合德镇，然后再由合德镇办事处分送到营业处和各代销社。因此，商品流转费用较大。今年全体职工经过爱国主义劳动竞赛，初步改善了经营管理，加强了经济核算制度。他们在今年秋季，进行购棉储棉工作，并供应粮食时，预先做出计划，在陈洋镇设立供应站，采用了直线运输的方法。如盐城、建湖、益林等地粮食，运到陈洋站后，就直接发往营业处和各代销合作社。这样，平均每一万斤粮食就节省运输、装卸、损耗等费用共二百七十斤大米。今年九月到十一月三个月内，从盐城、建湖、益林等地调来大米、小麦共一千零四十三万斤，除运送合德二百八十六万四千斤外，其余都是采用直线运输的方法，直接运到营业处和各代销社。共计运了七百五十六万一千斤粮食，节省了二十万零四千一百多斤大米的开支。如以每斤九百九十九元计算，这个办事处就给国家节省了二亿多元。                            陈彬
