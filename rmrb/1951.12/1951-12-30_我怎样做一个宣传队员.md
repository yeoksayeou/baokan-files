    How I Became a Propaganda Activist
       Wang Lihua, Seventh District, Beijing
    I am a woman from an old-fashioned family. The first time I went out to promote Resist America, Aid Korea, I encountered difficulties. It was in April, in our Nanhe Cao Hutong No. 1 courtyard, the old ladies were all doing chores in the yard. As soon as I went in and opened my mouth, everyone gradually went back into their houses. I was really sad! I thought about going back. But then I thought, are the volunteers having difficulties at the front? If I can't overcome this little difficulty, how can I resist America and aid Korea? I saw an old lady stretching noodles there, so I moved a small stool and sat next to her. I asked, "Old lady, how much is a pound of noodles?" She told me the price. So we started chatting. From the price of noodles, we talked about how things aren't getting more expensive now, and from eating white flour now, we talked about the past. The old lady said, "That's right, when the Japanese devils were here, forget about eating white flour, we couldn't even get mixed flour, we were always eating sweet potato slices and soybean cakes!" I asked about her son's occupation. She burst into tears. It turned out that her eldest son had been conscripted by the Kuomintang and died. So I started talking from there, telling her that American imperialism is coming to invade us again, and if we don't stand up to resist America and aid Korea, we won't be able to live a good life. As we talked, the old ladies in the houses all came out and sat down to listen to me. I was really happy, and I suddenly became good at talking. After I finished speaking, the old ladies all saw me to the door, and嘱咐[zhǔ fù; to enjoin; to tell; to exhort; to give detailed instructions]: "Come again when you have time, come and tell us more often!"
    After the widespread propaganda in April, all 180 households in our hutong knew what Resist America, Aid Korea was all about. On "May Day," more than 150 people went to the parade—last "May Day," only a dozen people from our hutong went. Later, we promoted the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the donation of airplanes and cannons, the preferential treatment of the families of martyrs and soldiers, and sanitation. We were really happy, as long as we promoted it well, everyone was so enthusiastic about loving the country. Fewer people in our section failed to report their household registration, and the police station also received more than a dozen letters reporting counter-revolutionary elements. Our 180 families in Nanhe Cao Hutong donated a total of 6.3 million yuan to buy airplanes and cannons. Many housewives and old ladies came up with various ways to increase production. Take the No. 4 courtyard where I live as an example: Old Man Lu makes schoolbags and masks, and Uncle Wu takes them to the streets to sell. Old Lady Dong makes buttons. Mrs. Sun learned to pedal a machine to make clothes. It's really increasing production and donating! Our hutong's half-year donation plan was completed by November 2nd. The eight military families in our hutong didn't know each other before. Now, you sweep the courtyard, I fetch water and cook. When they see military families, everyone looks up to them. When there is news of victory at the front, our propaganda activists quickly go to the military families to tell them. If the military families have any difficulties, everyone helps to solve them. An elderly military family member, Chen Guifang, has suffered from eye disease for many years, and his left eye is blind, and his right eye is also sick. We discussed it: "Aren't the volunteers' parents the same as our parents? We have to help him cure his eyes." Everyone pooled together some money and helped Mr. Chen find an ophthalmologist to cure his eyes.
    After the propaganda, everyone's awareness has been raised, and many people want to learn. Our propaganda team established a small cultural station at No. 5 Nanhe Cao. The landlord, Old Man Wang, voluntarily donated a room. Our propaganda activists pasted it neatly. We borrowed photos, pictorials, and comic strips from the cultural center, and also subscribed to a newspaper. There are always one or two dozen people who come to see it every day. When there are many people, the two old gentlemen, Pang Chunquan and Lu Jihua, read the newspaper to everyone. Everyone heard that the volunteers were lacking books and magazines at the front, so they jointly subscribed to a copy of "China Youth" and a copy of "Current Affairs Handbook" and sent them to the front every month. Everyone heard that the volunteers missed the motherland at the front, so they wrote a letter to the volunteers about the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in our Nanhe Cao Hutong. Our hutong has a small cultural station, and it seems lively. This is not only a place for everyone to learn, but also where our propaganda activists hold meetings and check on the patriotic pact. This has also become our office for resisting America and aiding Korea.

    我怎样做一个宣传队员
       北京市第七区    王立华
    我是一个旧家庭的妇女。头一次出来宣传抗美援朝，就碰到了困难。那是四月里，在我们南河漕胡同一号大院里，老太太们都在院里做活。我一进去，刚一开口，大伙陆陆续续都回屋了。我心里真难过呀！心想回去。可又一想，志愿军在前方有没有困难呀？自己遇到这点儿困难就不能克服，还能抗美援朝吗？我看还有一个老太太在那儿伸面条，就搬个小板凳坐在她旁边。我问：“老大娘，面多少钱一斤啊？”她说多少多少钱一斤。我们就拉扯开了。从面价扯到这会儿东西不涨钱，从现在的吃白面扯到从前的生活。老太太说：“可不是，日本鬼子在这儿的时候，甭说吃白面，混合面还混不上呢，净吃白薯干、豆饼啊！”我问起老太太的儿子做什么。她掉下眼泪来了。原来她的大儿子被国民党抓去当兵死了。我就从这儿讲起来了，告诉她美帝国主义又要来侵略咱们，咱们要不起来抗美援朝，好日子可就过不了啦。我们谈着谈着，屋里的老太太们也就全出来了，都坐着听我讲。我心里真痛快，这会儿变得会说话了。讲完了，老太太们都把我送到门外，嘱咐着：“您有工夫再来，常来给我们讲讲啊！”
    经过四月份的普遍宣传，我们胡同里一百八十多户，家家都知道抗美援朝是怎么回事儿了。“五
    一”那天，有一百五十多人去游行——去年“五一”，我们胡同只去了十几个人。后来，我们宣传了镇压反革命，宣传了捐献飞机大炮，宣传了优待烈属军属，宣传了清洁卫生。我们真高兴，只要好好宣传，大伙都是那么热心爱国。我们段上漏报户口的人少了，派出所还接到了十几封检举反革命分子的信。我们南河漕胡同一百八十家，一共捐献了六百三十万元买飞机大炮。许多家庭妇女、老太太们想出了各种各样的增加生产的办法。就拿我住的四号大院来说：鲁老头做书包、口罩，吴大叔拿到街上去推销。董老太太做钮扣。孙太太学会了蹬机器做衣服。真是增产捐献呀！我们胡同里的半年捐献计划到十一月二日就完成了。我们胡同里八家军属，以前是大家不认识。这会，你给扫院子，我给挑水、做饭。见着了军属，都高看一眼。前线有什么胜利消息，我们宣传队员赶快到军属家里告诉他们。军属家里有什么困难，大伙帮助解决。有一位年老的军属陈桂方害了多年眼病，左眼瞎了，右眼又闹病。我们一商量：“志愿军的父母不是跟我们的父母一样吗？怎么也得帮着他把眼睛治好。”大伙一万两万凑了一些钱，帮着陈老先生找眼科大夫把眼睛看好了。
    经过宣传，大伙的觉悟提高了，很多人想学习。我们宣传队就在南河漕五号成立了一个小文化站。房东王老头自愿献出一间房子。我们几个宣传队员把它糊裱得干干净净的。从文化馆借来了照片、画报、连环画，又订了一份报纸。每天总有一二十个人来看。人多的时候，就由庞春泉、鲁季华两位老先生给大家读报。大家听说志愿军在前线缺少书刊，就合着订了一份“中国青年”、一份“时事手册”，按月寄给前线。大家听说志愿军在前线想念祖国的事情，就把我们南河漕胡同抗美援朝的工作情形写了一封信寄给志愿军了。我们胡同有了小文化站，可显得热闹了。这里不光是大伙学习的地方，我们宣传队员开碰头会呀，检查爱国公约呀，也都在这儿。这儿又成了我们抗美援朝的办公处了。
