The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to seriously implement the state's price policy, stipulated adjustments to the prices of grain, cotton cloth, and cooking oil at the end of November and the beginning of December. After inspecting the implementation in various regions, the following state-owned trading organizations were found not to have executed the adjustments according to the prescribed prices: The Northwest Trade Department adjusted cloth prices two days early and wheat prices four days early; the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce adjusted the price of Changsha Second Grade Rice ten days late, and the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce adjusted the price of Tianjin wheat one day late; the East China Trade Department adjusted the price of Shanghai raw oil three days late; the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce adjusted the price of Guangzhou raw oil three days late; the Zhengzhou Bureau of Industry and Commerce adjusted the price of corn one day late; the Pingyuan Provincial Department of Commerce adjusted the price of Xinxiang corn and sorghum one day late; and the Chahar Provincial Department of Commerce adjusted the price of Zhangjiakou No. 24 coarse sugar one day early.

Some of the above errors were caused by negligence on the part of the responsible authorities. For example, Chahar Province adjusted sugar prices one day early because the Provincial Department of Commerce issued the wrong notification; the Shanghai raw oil price adjustment was delayed by three days because the East China Trade Department forgot to include it in the notification. This kind of unnecessary negligence allowed profiteers to exploit loopholes, causing unwarranted losses to state property. The most serious case is that of the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce, which refused to implement the nationally unified price regulations because it disagreed with appropriately raising grain prices, and only implemented them after repeated urging from the Central-South Trade Department and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government. This is an act of being unorganized and undisciplined. They do not understand that in the current situation of complete national financial and monetary unification, the prices in any region must obey the unified command of the entire nation and must maintain reasonable price differences with other regions. No trade administration department in any region is allowed to determine prices based on its own wishes. The Central Ministry of Trade has now issued a circular to all parts of the country and has requested the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce to conduct a self-criticism.

    中央人民政府贸易部
    检查调整粮布价格
    部分地方未准时执行调整给奸商钻了空子，有关部门应进行检讨
    中央人民政府贸易部，为了严肃地贯彻国家的价格政策，在十一月底及十二月初规定调整粮食、纱布、食油价格。经检查各地执行情况后，查出下列国营贸易机关没有按照规定的牌价执行：西北贸易部对纱布价格提前两天调整，对面麦价格提前四天调整；湖南省商业厅对长沙二机米价格晚调整十天，天津市工商局对天津小麦价格晚调整一天；华东贸易部对上海生油价格晚调整三天；广州市工商局对广州生油价格晚调整三天；郑州工商局对玉米价格晚调整一天；平原省商业厅对新乡玉米、红粮价格晚调整一天；察哈尔省商业厅对张垣二四粗砂糖价格早调整一天。
    以上错误，有一部分是主管机关疏忽大意造成的。例如：察哈尔省把糖价提早一天调整，就是因为省商业厅通知错了；上海生油价格晚三天调整，是因为华东贸易部通知时遗忘了。这种不应有的疏忽大意，给奸商钻了空子，使国家财产遭到不应有的损失。最严重的是：湖南省商业厅因为不同意适当提高粮价，因而对全国统一的价格规定拒不执行，直到中南贸易部和中央人民政府贸易部再三督促后才执行，这是一种无组织无纪律行为。他们不了解在目前全国金融货币完全统一的情况下，任何一个地区的物价，都必须服从全国统一的指挥，必须和全国其他地区保持合理的差价，决不允许任何一个地区的贸易行政部门根据自己的愿望来决定价格。现中央贸易部已向全国各地发出通报，并要求湖南省商业厅进行检讨。（中央贸易部新闻报道组）
