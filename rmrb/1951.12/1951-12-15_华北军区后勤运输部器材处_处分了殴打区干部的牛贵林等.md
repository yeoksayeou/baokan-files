    Equipment Section of the Logistics and Transportation Department of the North China Military Region
    Disciplined Niu Guilin and Others for Beating District Cadres

    Editor: Regarding the matter raised by comrades Wang Rubin and Zhao Shujiang in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on December 5th, "Niu Guilin of the Transportation Section of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region (should be the Equipment Section of the Transportation Department) should be punished for beating district cadres," we have already handled it.

    After this incident occurred, the leadership sent me to investigate on November 17th. I, along with Comrade Gao Minglun, a staff officer from the Chahar South Military Sub-district, and Comrade Guo Zijing, the Armed Forces Minister of Xuanhua County, went to the place where the incident occurred to conduct an investigation and convened a meeting of local cadres, at which we apologized to the relevant cadres. Niu Guilin was wrong to hit people. However, Section Chief Xun Feixun, who was present at the time, should bear the main responsibility. In order to educate comrades Niu and Xun and other comrades, the Chinese Communist Party branch of our section decided to report to the higher party committee to give comrades Niu and Xun a public warning within the party and suggest that they be demoted administratively. In addition, Niu and Xun were ordered to write a written self-criticism so that they could thoroughly eliminate the remaining warlordism from their thinking. Through this incident, we have realized that we must earnestly strengthen the ideological leadership of the troops and strictly manage them in the future.

        Political Commissar of the Equipment Section of the Logistics and Transportation Department of the North China Military Region, Yang Guojing

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    华北军区后勤运输部器材处
    处分了殴打区干部的牛贵林等
    编辑同志：关于十二月五日人民日报“读者来信专页”所登载的王汝斌、赵树江两同志提出的“华北军区后勤部运输科（应为运输部器材处）牛贵林殴打区干部应受处分”一事，我们已经处理了。
    这件事发生后，领导方面在十一月十七日派我去了解。我就会同察南军分区参谋高明崙同志、宣化县武装部长郭子经同志到发生事情的地方进行调查，并召开了当地的干部会，在会上向有关干部道歉。牛贵林打人是错误的。但是，当时在场的寻非勋科长应负主要责任。为了教育牛、寻二同志及其他同志，我处中国共产党支部决定呈报上级党委给牛、寻二同志以党内当众警告处分，并建议行政上给他们以降职处分。另外责成牛、寻二同志作书面反省，使他们从思想上彻底肃清那种残余的军阀主义思想。经过这件事，我们认识到今后必须认真加强部队的思想领导，并严格管理。
        华北军区后勤运输部器材处政委　杨国敬
