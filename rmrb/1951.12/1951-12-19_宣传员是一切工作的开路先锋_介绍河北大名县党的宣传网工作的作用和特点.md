    Propagandists are the Pioneers of All Work
    —Introducing the Role and Characteristics of the Party's Propaganda Network in Daming County, Hebei
    Zhou Qingyu
    Since the establishment of the Party's propaganda network in Daming County, Hebei Province, it has proactively addressed the ideological issues of the masses, changed the work style of cadres, and strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses. Consequently, it has promoted and ensured the completion of various work tasks. Furthermore, the establishment of a mass propaganda team with propagandists as the backbone was created in the process of establishing the propaganda network, which laid a solid foundation for the regular conduct of mass propaganda work.
    The Party's propaganda network in Daming County was established on the basis of the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Patriotic Production Increase Movement. From the very beginning, the county Party committee grasped the key link of "establishing a propaganda network in the central task and ensuring the completion of the central task through the establishment of a propaganda network." It also implemented the patriotic and internationalist political education of Resist America, Aid Korea, so that the political enthusiasm of the broad masses was increased day by day with the development of various movements, and the Party's propaganda network and mass propaganda teams were also consolidated and developed with the development of various tasks. Daming County began to focus on establishing a propaganda network in the best branches in the urban area and the four districts at the end of February, while also absorbing comrades from neighboring branches to participate in learning. After April, the experience of focusing on establishing a propaganda network was extended to the second category of branches. The propaganda network was established in batches, step by step, under the principle of focusing on leadership and combining key points with the overall situation. By mid-November, the county's propaganda network had developed to 397 villages, with 7,416 Party propagandists, accounting for 2.3 percent of the county's population of 320,000. It also had 31,475 mass propaganda team members, including 2,018 broadcasters, 2,095 blackboard newspaper writers, and 2,046 rural theater actors. The Party's propaganda network has been established in most villages, and propaganda work has become the pioneer of all work. The calls of the Party and the government, through the activities of the mighty propaganda force, quickly turned into the actual actions of the masses.
    In the patriotic production increase movement, under the specific action slogan of learning from labor model Zhang Xishun, the propagandists mobilized the masses to carry out mutual aid in well-digging, variety improvement, technology improvement, and aphid extermination, giving full play to the masses' patriotic production enthusiasm and overcoming the masses' backward and conservative ideas. When Xiaohu Village in the four districts mobilized the masses to help each other dig wells, most people said that sandy land was not suitable for digging wells. The propagandists used the actual example of Zhang Xishun digging wells in sandy land to irrigate the land and harvesting more than 1,000 catties of grain per mu to inform the masses, which cleared up the masses' thinking. More than 80 mutual aid team leaders from the county went to Niangniang Temple to learn production experience from Zhang Xishun. When planting cotton, there was a drought, and some people prepared to plant cotton in bad land. The propagandists repeatedly explained the benefits of planting cotton and the truth of obeying the needs of the country by using specific accounting methods. At the same time, many clappers were compiled to encourage the masses to resist drought and plant cotton. For example, a clapper in Sun Gandian in the four districts describing Zhu Jiaxun's whole family participating in labor said: "Labor model Zhu Jiaxun, is really energetic in planting cotton. The mother carries the cotton seeds, Jiaxun carries the bucket, and the wife carries the basin. They planted more than half a mu during the day, and two or three tenths of a mu at night." Farmers in Daming, who had never had the habit of planting cotton in history, mobilized 180,000 men and women and used all the water-drawing equipment to complete the task of resisting drought and planting 150,000 mu of cotton fields through the activities of propagandists. In order to ensure the increase in cotton and grain production, the propagandists used all places to carry out propaganda activities. For example, when farmers were weeding, pruning, and spraying cotton aphids, the propagandists took advantage of the field breaks to explain the reasons for weeding, saying that farm tools are our guns, weeding and planting are our battlefields, and increasing production is a practical action to Resist America, Aid Korea. When farmers were weaving baskets, the propagandists explained the principles of organizing sideline production to them. Even ferries often had propagandists active on them, so that farmers could receive political propaganda everywhere.
    During flood prevention work, the propagandists encouraged the masses to block the breach in the Zhang River in four hours. The Zhang River is a major hazard in the three northern districts of Daming. In previous years, when floods occurred, the masses only cared about escaping. This year, the propagandists conducted flood prevention education for the masses, formulated flood prevention covenants, and proposed to protect crops from flooding. In August, mountain torrents broke out, and the riverbank breached 24 feet, and the flood poured down like a waterfall. At the moment when the riverbank breached, the masses along the river carried everything that could block water, such as door panels, sticks, branches, etc., and rushed to the riverbank. The propagandists also appeared on the river bank in a timely manner to carry out propaganda and mobilization work and commended the model of rushing to block the breach. In particular, the active participation of female propagandists in rushing to block the breach gave the masses great encouragement. The breach in the Zhang River, which had never been easily blocked in history, was blocked in just four hours, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of 110,000 people in the three districts along the river. When the leading comrades of the county Party committee talked about this matter, they deeply felt that only when the Party's propaganda work is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people can such miracles be created.
    The outstanding role of the Party's propaganda network is also manifested in the completion of the county's summer grain requisition task in one day. In previous years, summer grain requisition often took half a month or ten days from mobilization to collection, and even village-level cadres had to urge households, and there were still a few households that owed grain. This year, thanks to the full mobilization of the masses by the propagandists in advance, the enthusiasm of the masses to hand over grain was extremely high. The masses called public grain "patriotic grain" and ensured that it was "full," "dry," and "clean." When the government issued a notice on July 2 that the county would start collecting grain, the propaganda teams of various villages beat gongs and drums and sent grain into the warehouse. In less than a day, the county collected 3.8 million catties of public grain and exceeded the task by 300,000 catties. An old man in Zhao Village in the first district, who was 70 years old, originally had no public grain burden, but he also handed over 30 catties of wheat. The village cadre asked him not to hand it over, but he said: "We can't just call on young people to be patriotic. We old people must also do our part for the country." Some villages conducted political tests when handing over public grain. Almost all the masses could answer the political significance of handing over public grain: to Resist America, Aid Korea, protect the family and defend the country, and to defend Asian peace and world peace. The county finance and grain cadres said: "If we hadn't done propaganda work in advance, the collection would not have been so smooth."
    During the commemoration of National Day, 2,514 young people in Daming County enthusiastically signed up to join the National Defense Army in just seven days. At that time, propaganda activities were being carried out extensively. There were 41 reporters, 5,250 propagandists, and more than 23,000 propaganda team members in the county. They were distributed in every corner of the city and countryside, using various forms such as clappers, crosstalk, ditties, waist drums, flower sticks, Yangko dances, storytelling, street plays, slides, cartoons, blackboard newspapers, and broadcasting tubes. Based on the personal experiences of the masses, various small-scale symposiums, thinking meetings, old men's meetings, and women's meetings were held to conduct extensive and in-depth patriotic education. Yang Shikui, a propagandist from Longwang Temple, carried the news of his brother's meritorious service at the front and spread it everywhere, establishing a sense of honor among the masses that "everyone is responsible for defending the motherland." The masses recalled the facts that 301 people were forced to death by the Japanese invaders in Houying Village in the four districts during the Anti-Japanese War, all 120 households in Nanlizhuang were killed, and Jiuzhi Village was burned by the enemy five times, which they could never forget for generations, and they realized the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's motherland and themselves. Therefore, when the motherland called, many patriotic models of wives sending their husbands, mothers sending their sons, and sisters sending their brothers emerged. This enthusiastic enlistment situation fully demonstrated the great spirit of the Chinese people and fully demonstrated the power of the propagandists' work.
    The development of the Party's propaganda network has educated cadres, making them begin to understand the necessity of using propaganda to promote work and begin to develop the atmosphere of reasoning. Their slogan is that everyone must publicize and everything must be reasonable. Now they are full of work enthusiasm and confidence. They said: "In the past, we often committed the command style in our work. Now that we have more manpower, once we publicize and mobilize and assign people to take responsibility for different areas, the work will be easier to handle." The masses' reaction to the work style of the cadres is: "In the past, it was like adding chili peppers to honey, but now they are polite." Cadres at all levels, propagandists and propaganda team members in each village all agree on one truth: "Whether the work can be done well depends first on whether you publicize it or not." For example, the work of Li Erzhuang in the first district was much worse than that of Dong Luozhuang before the establishment of the propaganda network, but after Li Erzhuang established the propaganda network, the work progressed rapidly. However, Dong Luozhuang lagged behind because it did not establish a propaganda network. Li Erzhuang planted 630 mu of cotton and dug four wells, while Dong Luozhuang only planted 410 mu and said that digging wells was not energetic. More than 70 percent of the masses in Li Erzhuang understand the root cause and future of Resist America, Aid Korea, while only a few village cadres, Party members, and students in Dong Luozhuang understand it. Under such a comparison, the cadres in Dong Luozhuang said: "If our village doesn't establish a propaganda network, we won't be able to keep up!"
    Many facts prove that wherever there are propaganda activities, the face of the place is renewed. The propagandists of Daming County not only showed their great strength in patriotic production increase, well-digging and flood prevention, summer grain requisition, and military expansion, but also played a great role in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, implementing the Marriage Law, donating weapons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In the past, there was still a seasonal habit of burning incense and worshiping Buddha in rural areas. Now, only a few old men and old women are doing these things secretly, and the vast majority of the masses now advocate replacing old festivals with new ones. On May Day, the masses all put on new clothes, as lively as the Spring Festival. Seventy-six percent of the farmers in the county participated in mutual aid teams, and agricultural productivity exceeded the pre-war level by more than 50 percent. Everyone goes to the people's school to study every night, portraits of Chairman Mao are hung in every village and household, new houses are built everywhere, and free marriages are becoming more and more common.
    Why can the propaganda network work in Daming County play such a huge role in various tasks, and why can the Party's propaganda network continue to develop? This is because:
    First, the Party organizations in the county generally recognize that running a good propaganda network is an indispensable organization for promoting central work and strengthening ties between the Party and the masses, and they have established a relatively sound leadership system. Cadres at all levels from the county to the village realize that grasping the ideological problems of the masses and solving them is the key to all work. The county Party committee often tells cadres: "If you don't do a good job of propaganda, your work cannot be done well." Many cadres in districts and townships said: "Wood cannot be drilled through without drilling. Propaganda work is a splitting axe. Once the thinking is cleared, everything is easy to handle!" The county and district Party committees have effectively made propaganda work a part of work deployment, inspection, and summary, requiring "where people are, propaganda is there." After accepting the tasks from the higher authorities, the village branch first convenes a meeting of Party members and then a meeting of propagandists to study the thinking of the masses and propaganda methods. A total of 82 teaching stations have been established in the county, of which 71 can effectively carry out work in accordance with the prescribed system. For example, there are 54 administrative villages in the four districts, and a total of 11 teaching stations have been established. Each station is equipped with one station director and one deputy station director, who are selected from the propagandists in each village who have the ability and prestige. The district Party committee divides the entire district into three large villages based on the distribution of natural villages and assigns leaders to lead the work. A station is set up at the center of each large village to teach propaganda content. The district Party committee reports to all propagandists in the large villages once every half month. The propagandists of each village go to the central station to study once every first and fifteenth day of the month, and it has become a habit. In addition to reporting once every half month, the district Party committee also holds a meeting of station directors every seven days to listen to work reports and mass reactions and to teach new propaganda content. Later, the station directors gathered propagandists from small villages in rotation to listen to lectures at the station. After that, the duty propagandists conveyed the information to all the propagandists in the village, launched discussions, and conducted propaganda by zones and households. In this way, the station directors actually became assistants to the district reporters. Although there was one more layer of teaching, it solved the difficulties that the district was large, the district Party committee had insufficient manpower, and it could not take care of everything. Under the unified leadership of the Party, cultural and educational committees have been established from the county to the village since May of this year. The propaganda committee member of the village branch serves as the director or deputy director of the cultural and educational committee. In various tasks, the departments related to propaganda work are organized and fixed to ensure that the decisions of the Party and the government are implemented in a unified and rapid manner. Now, more than 80 percent of the branches in the county have established leadership systems for the propaganda network, such as meeting systems, learning systems, daily work systems, and inspection, summary, evaluation, and commendation systems. After each central task is completed, a summary is carried out, models are commended, and organizations are developed, so that the propagandists can always maintain vigorous vitality. These ensure the regularization of propaganda work.
    Second, serious and prudent attention has been paid to the selection and training of propagandists. The political quality and work ability of all 7,416 propagandists in the county meet the conditions stipulated by the central government. They have all been selected through the training and testing of various specific struggles. More than half of the propagandists in the county were produced after several propaganda competitions for central work. For example, Xingjiazhai in the first district developed 16 propagandists after five competitions in cotton planting propaganda. In addition to convening representative meetings of propagandists every month, the county Party committee also ran training courses for propagandists. A total of 1,680 people have studied in the training courses of the county Party committee. Secondly, the county Party committee instructed the district Party committees to hold rotational training courses. According to the distance of the villages where the propaganda network has been established, the propagandists of each village are designated to study at the central location, and the secretary of the district Party committee is responsible for explaining "Propagandist's Knowledge," requiring that it be established, trained, consolidated, and improved as it is established. All the propagandists in the county have undergone rotational training at the district level. In order to consciously expand the influence of establishing the propaganda network, the Daming County Party Committee has determined that each time it convenes representative meetings of propagandists and runs training courses, as well as when teaching stations give lessons, it should pay attention to absorbing the propaganda and education committee members of the village branches that have not established a propaganda network, Party members and activists who are qualified to be propagandists in the future to participate in learning, so as to prepare for the establishment of the propaganda network. In addition, the propagandists and propaganda team members under the leadership of the branch are mostly students of people's schools. Many propagandists not only improve their work ability under the education of training courses and teaching stations, but they can also obtain propaganda materials in the learning of people's schools, thereby ensuring the regular conduct of propaganda work.
    Third, under the leadership of the branch, a propaganda team with propagandists as the backbone was organized. The conditions for propaganda team members are: obeying leadership, working actively, and being politically pure. The propaganda team has organizational, propaganda, writing and painting, broadcasting, editing, reading newspapers, drama, and other sections. Propagandists often serve as section chiefs in these organizations. In this way, young people and artists in rural areas who love cultural and entertainment propaganda activities are brought together to carry out planned and regular activities. The Party's propagandists are scattered in the mass propaganda team, ensuring that the propaganda team can carry out work in an organized and led manner. The Party's propagandists are the backbone of the propaganda team, and the propaganda team members are the backbone of the broad masses. Therefore, the expansion of the mass propaganda team creates favorable conditions for the expansion of the Party's propaganda work. In addition, Daming County has also created a method of setting up assistants for propagandists. Each propagandist has two or three assistants, who are all excellent propaganda team members. And propagandist assistants are the reserve of propagandists.
    Fourth, in terms of propaganda form, attention is paid to diversity, and the propaganda form that is most universally loved by the local masses—the clapper form—is used for propaganda. This greatly exerted the creative wisdom of the masses, and many vivid, popular, and combative clappers appeared. According to incomplete statistics, since the establishment of the propaganda network, the masses have compiled more than 5,000 clappers and more than 300 ditties. Song Dianliang, a propagandist from Nan Erpu Village in Chengguan District, has become a writer recognized by the local masses under the cultivation of the Party and the government. Up to now, he has compiled a total of 321 clappers, crosstalks, songs, and new dramas. Many propagandists carry melon clappers in their pockets and can sing and speak everywhere. Once any work is deployed to the village, clappers that publicize the central work are compiled in less than two days. Secondly, the form of small-scale symposiums that the masses are accustomed to is widely adopted to mobilize the masses to recall the past, compare the present, and look at the future. This is an important method for deeply mobilizing the masses to carry out self-education. As long as the propagandists and propaganda team members are good at enlightenment, the masses will naturally say what is in their hearts.
    In general, the Party's propaganda network work in Daming County has achieved results. It proactively grasped the thinking of the masses, paid attention to the ideological education of the masses, and has a relatively sound leadership system. It carefully paid attention to the selection and training of propagandists. It created a propaganda team led by propagandists. At the same time, it also paid attention to adopting the propaganda forms that the masses most universally love. Therefore, it can promote the completion of central work and at the same time develop and consolidate the Party's propaganda network for the people. However, the development of the propaganda network is still uneven. Among the 517 rural branches in the county, there are still 23.7 percent, or 123 branches, that have not established propagandists and propaganda teams. In particular, the Party's propaganda work is still very weak in the flood-stricken areas along the Zhang River. The role played by the branches that have established a propaganda network also varies greatly: 233 branches regularly play a role, 135 branches play a role but not regularly enough, and 26 branches do not play a role. Secondly, the commandism work style of cadres has not been completely eliminated, and the remnants of feudal ideas among the masses still exist, which has become a major obstacle to the implementation of the Marriage Law. Individual propaganda teams still have a tendency to be extravagant and wasteful. Among the 640 cadres who have left production in the county, 204 are illiterate, and most of the propaganda team members are illiterate. According to statistics from the four districts, among the 1,520 propagandists, 1,200 are illiterate, so it is difficult for them to obtain materials directly from books.
    In order to improve the political and cultural level of propagandists and to consolidate and develop the Party's propaganda network, the Party's leading organs in Daming County must make greater efforts. (Attached picture)

    宣传员是一切工作的开路先锋
    ——介绍河北大名县党的宣传网工作的作用和特点
    周擎宇
    河北省大名县自建立党的宣传网以来，主动地解决群众思想问题，改变干部作风，更加密切了党和群众的联系，因而推动和保证了各项工作任务的完成。此外，在建立宣传网的过程中又创造了以宣传员为骨干的群众宣传大队，这样就为群众宣传工作的经常进行，打下了巩固的基础。
    大名县党的宣传网工作是在抗美援朝爱国丰产运动的基础上建立起来的。县委一开始就掌握了“在中心工作中建立宣传网，通过建立宣传网保证中心工作的完成”的环节；并贯彻抗美援朝的爱国主义和国际主义的政治教育，使广大群众的政治热情随着各项运动的开展日益提高，党的宣传网和群众宣传队也随着各项工作的开展得到了巩固和发展。大名县二月底开始在城区和四区的最好的支部中实行重点建立宣传网，同时吸收邻近支部同志参加学习。四月以后，将重点建立宣传网的经验推行到第二类支部去。在重点领导和点面结合的方针下分批建立宣传网，稳步前进；到十一月中旬，全县宣传网已发展到三百九十七个村，党的宣传员有七千四百一十六人，占全县三十二万人口的百分之二点三，并拥有群众宣传队员三万一千四百七十五名，其中有广播员二千零一十八名，黑板报书写员二千零九十五名，农村剧团演员二千零四十六名。党的宣传网在绝大部分村庄都已建立，宣传工作成为一切工作的开路先锋。党和政府的号召，通过千军万马的宣传队伍的活动，很快变成了群众的实际行动。
    在爱国丰产运动中，在学习劳动模范张希舜的具体行动口号之下，宣传员发动了群众进行互助打井、改良品种、提高技术、扑灭蚜虫等工作，发挥了群众爱国生产的积极性，克服了群众落后保守思想。四区小湖村在动员群众互助打井时，大多数人都说沙地不适于打井，宣传员就拿张希舜沙地打井浇地、每亩收谷子一千多斤的实际事例告诉群众，打通了群众的思想。全县有八十多名互助组长到娘娘庙张希舜那里去学习生产经验。种棉时，天旱不雨，有些人准备把棉花种在坏地里，宣传员用具体算账的方法反复地向他解释种棉花的好处和服从国家需要的道理。同时编了许多快板，鼓励群众抗旱点种。如四区孙甘店一篇描写朱家训全家参加劳动的快板说：“劳动模范朱家训，点种棉花真有劲。母亲扛着棉花种，家训担桶妻担盆。白天点了多半亩，月夜又点两三分。”大名历史上从来没有种棉习惯的农民，经过宣传员的活动，动员了男女十八万人，使用了所有的打水器具，完成了十五万亩棉田的抗旱点种的任务。为了保证棉粮增产，宣传员利用一切场所展开宣传活动。如农民在锄草、整枝、打棉蚜时，宣传员就乘着田间休息的时刻，讲解锄草的道理，说农具是我们的枪，锄草种地是我们的战场，提高产量就是抗美援朝的实际行动。农民在编筐子时，宣传员就向他们讲解组织副业生产的道理。甚至渡船上也经常有宣传员在活动。使农民到处可以受到政治宣传。
    宣传员在防汛工作中，鼓励了群众在四小时内堵住了漳河缺口。漳河是大名北部三个区的大害。往年发水，群众只顾各自逃难。今年，宣传员向群众进行了防汛教育，制订了防汛公约，提出保住庄稼不受水淹。八月间，山洪暴发，河堤决溃二十四丈，大水瀑布似地向下倾泻。在这河堤溃决的顷刻间，沿河群众扛着一切可以堵水的东西，如门板，棍棒，树枝等，蜂涌地奔上河堤。宣传员又及时地出现在河边，进行宣传鼓动工作，表扬抢堵模范；特别是女宣传员积极参加抢堵，给群众很大的鼓舞。历史上从来就难以堵住的漳河缺口，仅仅在四小时内就堵住了。保障了沿河三个区十一万人民生命财产的安全。县委领导同志一谈起这事，深深感到只有党的宣传工作深入人心，才能创造这样的奇迹。
    党的宣传网突出的作用还表现在一天完成了全县夏征任务。往年夏征，从动员到征收，常常拖延半月十天不能完成，甚至村级干部挨户催促，还不免有几家尾欠。今年夏征，由于宣传员事先向群众作了充分动员，因此群众缴粮的热情极高。群众都把公粮叫做“爱国粮”，保证做到“饱”、“干”、“净”。当政府发出七月二日全县开征的通知后，各村宣传大队，敲锣打鼓，送粮入仓，全县不足一天时间收齐公粮三百八十万斤，并且超过任务三十万斤。一区赵庄有个七十岁的老汉，原来没有公粮负担，也缴了麦子三十斤，村干部叫他不缴，他说：“可不能光叫青年人爱国，俺年老的也得对国家出一份力。”有些村庄在缴纳公粮时，进行政治测验，差不多所有群众都能答出交公粮的政治意义：为了抗美援朝，保家卫国，为了保卫亚洲和平和世界和平。县财粮干部说：“要不是事先做好宣传工作，征收一定不能这样爽快。”
    在纪念国庆节的时候，大名县仅仅在七天中就有两千五百十四名青年踊跃报名参加国防军。当时正是在宣传活动广泛展开的时候。全县有报告员四十一名，宣传员五千二百五十名，宣传队员两万三千余名，他们分布在城乡每个角落，运用各种各样的形式，如快板、相声、小调、腰鼓、花棍、秧歌、舞蹈、说书、街头剧、幻灯、漫画、黑板报、广播筒等，根据群众的亲身经历，召开各种小型座谈会、想想会、老头会、老婆会，进行广泛深入的爱国主义教育。龙王庙宣传员杨士奎拿着他兄弟在前方立功报喜的消息到处传播，在群众中树立了“保卫祖国人人有责”的荣誉感。群众回想抗日战争期间，四区后营村被日寇逼死三百零一口人，南李庄一百二十户全部死绝，旧治村被敌人连烧五次等祖祖辈辈永远不能忘记的事实，认识到人民祖国和自己的血肉关系。因此，祖国一声召唤，便涌现了许多妻送郎、母送子、姊妹送兄弟的爱国的模范事例。这种踊跃参军的情况，充分表现了中国人民的伟大气魄。同时充分表现了宣传员工作的力量。
    党的宣传网的发展，教育了干部，使他们开始懂得用宣传推动工作的必要，开始养成讲道理的风气。他们的口号是，必须人人宣传，事事讲理。现在他们充满了工作热情和信心。他们说：“过去干工作，常常犯了命令派，现在人手多了，一宣传动员，分片包干，工作就好办了。”群众对干部作风的反应是：“过去是蜜上沾辣椒，现在有礼气了。”各级干部、各村宣传员和宣传队员一致承认一个真理：“工作能不能作好，首先看你宣传不宣传。”如一区李二庄的工作在建立宣传网前比东罗庄差的很远，但以后由于李二庄建立了宣传网，工作就突飞猛进。而东罗庄因为没有建立宣传网反而落后了。李二庄种棉六百三十亩，打井四眼，而东罗庄只种了四百一十亩，还说打井没劲头儿。李二庄有百分之七十以上的群众懂得抗美援朝的根由和前途。而东罗庄只有少数村干部、党员、学生懂得。在这样的对比下，东罗庄的干部说：“俺村再不建立宣传网就跟不上趟啦！”
    许多事实证明：那里有了宣传员活动，那里的面貌就为之一新。大名县的宣传员不仅在爱国丰产、打井防汛、夏征、扩军中显示了他们的巨大力量，在镇压反革命、贯彻婚姻法、捐献武器、优待烈属军属等工作中也发挥了很大的作用。过去农村中还残存着季节性烧香拜佛的习惯，现在只有少数老头儿和老太婆躲躲藏藏地干着这些事，而绝大部分群众现在已经主张用新的节日代替旧的节日。五一劳动节群众都穿起了新衣，像春节一样热闹。全县有百分之七十六的农户参加了互助组，农业生产率超过了战前水平百分之五十以上。每晚大家到民校学习，村村户户都挂起了毛主席像，到处修造新房，自由结婚的事情也一天天多起来了。
    为什么大名县的宣传网工作能够在各项工作中发生如此巨大的作用，为什么党的宣传网能够一直发展呢？这是因为：
    第一、全县的党组织一般都承认办好宣传网，是推动中心工作密切党和群众联系不可缺少的组织，并建立了比较健全的领导制度。从县到村各级干部都认识到抓住群众思想问题并加以解决，是一切工作的锁钥。县委经常向干部讲：“如果不作好宣传工作，你的工作就不能做好。”区乡许多干部都说：“木不钻不透，宣传工作是劈心斧，打通了思想，啥事也好办！”县委区委已经切实做到把宣传工作列为工作布置、检查和总结的一个部分，要求“人在那里，宣传在那里”。村支部在接受上级任务后，首先开支部党员大会接着召开宣传员大会，研究群众思想和宣传办法。全县共建立传授站八十二处，其中能切实按照规定制度进行工作的共七十一处。如四区共五十四个行政村，一共建立了十一个传授站。各站设正副站长各一人，由各村宣传员中有能力有威信的担任。区委依据自然村分布情况，把全区分为三个大片村分工领导，在每个大片村的中心地点设站传授宣传内容。区委每半月向大片村的全体宣传员做一次报告。各村宣传员每逢初一十六就去中心站学习一次，并已成为习惯。区委除半月报告一次外，每七天又召开站长会议一次，听取工作汇报和群众反应，并传授新的宣传内容。以后各站站长即召集小片村宣传员轮流到站听讲，再以后由值班宣传员向全村宣传员传达，展开讨论，并分片分户进行宣传。这样，各传授站长事实上成为区报告员的助手，虽然多了一个传授层次，却解决了地区大、区委人手不足，不能处处照顾的困难。在党的统一领导下，从今年五月以后，从县到村都建立了文教委员会，村支部的宣传委员担任文教委员会的主任委员或副主任委员，在各种工作中，把有关宣传工作的部门有组织地固定地联系起来，保证了步调一致迅速地贯彻党和政府的决议。现在全县已有百分之八十以上的支部建立了对宣传网的领导制度，如会议制度，学习制度，日常工作制度，以及检查、总结、评比、表扬等制度。在每一中心任务完成后，再进行总结，表扬模范，发展组织，使宣传员经常保持蓬勃的朝气。这些就保证了宣传工作的经常化。
    第二、认真慎重地注意了对宣传员的选拔和培养。全县七千四百一十六名宣传员的政治素质和工作能力都符合中央规定的条件，他们都是经过各种具体斗争的锻炼和考验而被选拔出来的。全县有二分之一以上的宣传员是经过几次中心工作宣传竞赛以后产生的。如一区行家寨经过种棉宣传五次竞赛，才发展了十六名宣传员。县委训练宣传员的办法，除每月召开宣传员代表大会外，并开办了宣传员训练班，先后到县委训练班学习的共一千六百八十人。其次，县委并责成区委举办轮回训练班，根据已建立宣传网村庄的远近，指定各村宣传员到中心地点学习，由区委书记负责讲“宣传员须知”，要求做到随建立，随训练，随巩固，随提高。全县所有宣传员都经过区上轮训一遍。大名县委为了有意识地扩大建立宣传网的影响，确定每次召开宣传代表会议和开办训练班，以及传授站上课时，注意吸收未建立宣传网的村支部宣教委员、将来有条件当宣传员的党员和积极分子参加学习，以便做好建立宣传网的准备工作。此外，支部领导下的宣传员和宣传队员大多数是民校学员。许多宣传员不仅在训练班、传授站教育下，提高了工作能力，他们又可以在民校学习中获得宣传资料，从而保证了宣传工作的经常进行。
    第三、在支部领导下，组织了以宣传员为骨干的宣传大队。宣传队员的条件是：服从领导，工作积极，政治纯洁。宣传大队下设组织、宣传、写画、广播、编辑、读报、话剧等股，宣传员在这些组织中多任股长，这样，就把农村中爱好文化娱乐宣传活动的青年和艺人，汇集在一起，进行有计划的经常性的活动。党的宣传员分散在群众性的宣传大队里，保证了宣传队能够有组织有领导地进行工作。党的宣传员是宣传大队中的骨干，而宣传大队队员又是广大群众中的骨干。因此，群众宣传大队的扩展，就为党的宣传工作扩展创造了有利条件。此外大名县还创造了给宣传员设立助手的办法，每个宣传员都有两三个助手，他们都是优秀的宣传队员。而宣传员助手就是宣传员的后备。
    第四、在宣传形式上既注意了多样性，又善于运用当地群众最普遍爱好的宣传形式——快板形式进行宣传。这大大地发挥了群众的创作智慧，出现了许多生动的通俗的富有战斗性的快板。据不完全统计，建立宣传网以来，群众自编的快板有五千多首，小调三百多篇。城关区南二铺村宣传员宋殿良在党和政府的培养下，成为当地群众公认的作家。截至现在为止，由他编出的快板、相声、歌谣、新剧，共有三百二十一首。许多宣传员口袋里装有瓜得板，到处可以说唱。一切工作布置到村，不到两天，宣传中心工作的快板就编出来了。其次，普遍采用群众习惯的小型座谈会的形式，发动群众回忆过去，比比现在、看看将来，是深入发动群众进行自我教育的重要方法。只要宣传员和宣传队员善于启发，群众很自然地会说出心底的话。
    总的说来，大名县党的宣传网工作是有成绩的，它主动地掌握了群众思想，注意了对群众的思想教育，有着比较健全的领导制度。它慎重地注意了宣传员的选拔和培养。它创造了宣传员带领下的宣传大队。同时，它又注意了采取群众最普遍爱好的宣传形式。因此，它能够推动中心工作的完成，同时发展和巩固党对人民群众的宣传网。但是，宣传网的发展还是不平衡的，全县五百一十七个农村支部中还有百分之二十三点七，即一百二十三个支部没有建立宣传员和宣传队，特别是漳河沿岸的水灾地区，党的宣传工作还很薄弱。已建立宣传网的支部所起的作用也有大有小：经常起作用的支部二百三十三个，起些作用但不够经常的有一百三十五个，不起作用的有二十六个。其次，干部中的命令主义作风还未完全肃清，群众中的封建思想残余依然存在，因而成为贯彻对婚姻法的很大障碍，个别地方宣传队还发生铺张浪费的偏向。全县六百四十名脱离生产的干部，有二百零四名是文盲，而宣传队员大多数不认字。据四区统计：一千五百二十名宣传员中，文盲占有一千二百名，因而他们很难从书本上直接获得材料。
    为了提高宣传员的政治和文化水平，为了党的宣传网的巩固和发展，大名县党的领导机关还必须作更大的努力。（附图片）
