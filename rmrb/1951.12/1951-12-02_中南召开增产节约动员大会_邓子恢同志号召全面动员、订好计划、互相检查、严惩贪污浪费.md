Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th -- The Central-South Military and Administrative Committee convened a mobilization meeting for increased production and thrift this afternoon.  Nearly 2,000 people attended, including cadres at the section chief level and above from organizations directly under the Central-South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, as well as responsible persons from people's organizations, and economic, industrial, commercial, and personnel departments of various provinces and municipalities in the Central-South region and Wuhan. Zhang Zhiyi, Secretary-General of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, presided over the meeting. Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, delivered a mobilization report on launching the campaign for increased production and thrift. After elaborating on the significant political, economic construction, financial, and organizational aspects of carrying out the campaign for increased production and thrift in the Central-South region, Vice Chairman Deng proposed that in order to carry out the campaign for increased production and thrift in the Central-South region, industrial and mining enterprises should improve production efficiency and reduce costs; financial and trade departments should improve operations, reduce commodity circulation costs, and accelerate capital turnover; and in terms of basic engineering construction, wasteful behaviors such as poor design and blind construction should be opposed. Vice Chairman Deng especially emphasized that government agencies should do a good job in streamlining and economizing, and that all agencies should immediately tighten staffing, save all possible expenses, and transfer personnel to enrich production departments and grassroots organizations. Vice Chairman Deng pointed out that in order to make the increased production and thrift campaign a mass movement and achieve the goal of creating new systems and new morals, attention should be paid to: 1. Full mobilization; all levels of institutions should conduct widespread and in-depth mobilization. 2. Leading cadres should set an example, first conduct self-criticism, and then formulate plans; all departments in the Central-South region must formulate plans for increased production and thrift before the first half of December, and each province should formulate a provincial plan by the end of December. 3. Mutual inspection; the Central-South's supervisory committees and inspection teams will focus on inspecting corruption and waste. 4. Severe punishment for corruption and waste; serious cases must be investigated and punished; those who are honest and devoted to their duties should be rewarded. Vice Chairman Deng also proposed that the increased production and thrift campaign should be carried out in conjunction with rectification, party consolidation, and cadre review.
