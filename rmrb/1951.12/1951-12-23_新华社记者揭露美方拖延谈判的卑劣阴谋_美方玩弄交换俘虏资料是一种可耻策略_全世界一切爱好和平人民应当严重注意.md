Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd: A special correspondent for this agency reports: The shocking perfunctory, careless, and irresponsible attitude adopted by the U.S. side on the issue of exchanging prisoner-of-war data, and the U.S. side's shameful and malicious stance towards the accurate, detailed, and complete prisoner-of-war data submitted by our side, once again raises a serious question to the world: Does the U.S. side really want to resolve the Korean armistice issue, or does it want to indefinitely delay or even sabotage the armistice negotiations?

As is well known, as early as December 4th, the U.S. representative on the Third Agenda Subcommittee, while refusing to consider the fair and reasonable suggestions put forward by our side, made a suspicious request, saying that in order to "accelerate the progress of the negotiations," it suggested designating a subcommittee to discuss the Fourth Agenda. After this, the U.S. representative and its propaganda machine clamored daily about so-called "humanitarian principles," putting on a face of "great concern" for their captured personnel. On December 11th, based on the position of making every effort to reach an agreement, our side accepted the other side's request to establish a Fourth Agenda Subcommittee and put forward the true humanitarian principle: that both sides should quickly release all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement. On December 12th, our side also put forward five specific suggestions for the rapid resolution of the Fourth Agenda. The irrefutable reasonableness of our suggestions made it impossible for the U.S. representative to openly oppose them. However, they then created new complications, insisting at the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee on exchanging prisoner-of-war data as a prerequisite for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. U.S. representative Libby pretended to be willing to quickly reach an agreement on the Fourth Agenda, saying at the 16th Subcommittee meeting: "We are eager to begin discussing your suggestions and the Fourth Agenda immediately after receiving and studying the prisoner-of-war data we requested on November 27th."

On December 18th, in order to eliminate all excuses for the other side to obstruct negotiations, our side agreed to exchange prisoner-of-war data and submitted complete and sufficient prisoner-of-war data to the other side, including nationality, military number, rank, unit, and prisoner-of-war camp location. These data were compiled in Korean and English according to different situations.

Looking at the data submitted by the U.S. side, it was a pile of waste paper totaling more than two thousand pages and twelve inches high. In this data, in addition to the so-called prisoner's name spelled in English and the other side's self-compiled number, all other necessary materials—such as Korean and Chinese lists, unit designation, and rank—were completely missing. As for the accuracy of this data, it was not so much impossible to verify at all as it was deliberately designed so that you could not verify it. The U.S. side's adoption of such an intolerable and careless attitude towards the issue of exchanging prisoner-of-war data, which they first raised and insisted on for a long time, fully exposes that the U.S. side's repeated requests to exchange this data is just a despicable trick they are playing, using lies such as so-called "accelerating negotiations," "humanitarianism," and "caring for prisoners" as a fig leaf for their continued delay and obstruction of negotiations.

However, the absurdity of the matter goes far beyond this. The U.S. side's frivolous attitude towards negotiations is also reflected in the shameful attitude adopted by the U.S. side towards the complete and accurate data submitted by our side. Originally, the accuracy and completeness of our data was something that even some figures on the U.S. side and official representatives of its allied countries could not but acknowledge. For example, the Australian radio station broadcast on the 20th: "Commonwealth Division Commander Cassels said that the most encouraging thing is that the Communists claimed to have captured 919 British soldiers, because only 1,150 were initially declared missing." The broadcast also said: "Commonwealth Division officials said that the six Australian prisoners of war on the Communist list were also the six soldiers that the Australian government had formally declared missing in the past." On the French side, according to an Associated Press report on the 18th: "French military sources said tonight that all ten soldiers of the French battalion listed as missing in action were on the Communist prisoner-of-war list." Even some figures on the U.S. side had initially acknowledged the accuracy of our data. According to an Associated Press report from Tokyo on the 18th: "A reliable source" comparing "the military's estimate of the number of Allied soldiers in the hands of the Chinese Communists with the number handed over by the Chinese Communists" said: "I don't think there is much difference." International News Service Tokyo also admitted on the 19th: "Today, at least as far as the portion of the U.S. prisoner-of-war list submitted by the Communists that has been studied so far, the information on the list is accurate."

However, U.S. official figures have attempted to deny the accuracy and completeness of our data with arbitrary slander. Nokes, the so-called spokesman for the United Nations Command delegation, who specializes in spreading rumors and slander, said on the evening of the 18th, before checking the prisoner-of-war data submitted by our side, that "we have doubts about the details, reliability, accuracy, and completeness of the list." On the same day, the United Nations Command even issued a statement asserting that our "any information about prisoners of war is questionable."

However, this arbitrary denial of confirmed facts by U.S. officials not only cannot diminish the full value of our data, but instead puts the U.S. side in an extremely confused, contradictory, and embarrassing situation. Let alone the acknowledgment of officials of U.S. puppet states, even the acknowledgment of the U.S. Department of Defense after research gave Nokes and his ilk a resounding slap in the face. According to Agence France-Presse, the U.S. Department of Defense said on the 19th that "as of noon local time, about half of the names on the Communist American prisoner-of-war list have been checked, and there are very few errors." Although the U.S. Department of Defense did not have the courage to say that our data was completely accurate, officials in the military affairs department of Ridgway Headquarters in Tokyo, after studying one-third of our data, helplessly admitted that our "data is accurate" and that "the names, ranks, and numbers seem to be correct."

The U.S. official's foolish attempt to deny the accuracy of our data has put them in such an incurable state of confusion that even the statements of Ridgway Headquarters and the White House have come into sharp conflict. For example, according to the United States Information Service: Truman's press secretary Short, on Truman's orders, issued a statement on the 19th asking "everyone to treat this list (referring to our data) with suspicion." However, International News Service reported from Tokyo on the 20th: "General Ridgway's headquarters discovered today that the list of Allied prisoners of war submitted by the Communists is correct, at least as far as the names listed on the list are concerned." In this way, the world saw a dramatic and embarrassing scene, with Ridgway in the First Building in Tokyo and Truman in the White House in Washington slapping each other in the face. Why have the U.S. aggressors put themselves in such a confused and embarrassing position on this issue? This is because the U.S. side's strategy of using the exchange of prisoner-of-war data to delay negotiations is just a foolish trick. Reuters Tokyo revealed this ugly drama of the U.S. aggressors on the 18th. The dispatch expressed concern about the impact of the prisoner-of-war data submitted by the Korean and Chinese sides, believing that this "is bringing a heavy burden to the (U.S.) negotiators" and "carries the danger of creating new pressure. This pressure may limit the ability of the United Nations Command to freely negotiate the terms of a formal armistice agreement." The dispatch said: "If the relatives of the prisoners of war whose names have been announced now know that whether they can be released depends on a formal armistice agreement, then the command will be swayed by the opinions of these relatives when debating many other differences at Panmunjom." Obviously, it is precisely for this reason that a handful of war merchants in the United States had to hurriedly create this flawed farce after our side submitted the prisoner-of-war data, attempting to deceive the domestic people in order to continue delaying the armistice negotiations.

Why do the U.S. representatives and the White House authorities, on the one hand, adopt an absolutely irresponsible and careless attitude towards the data they themselves submitted, and on the other hand, adopt an arbitrary, black-and-white attitude towards the data submitted by our side, thus falling into an extremely confused and embarrassing situation? Isn't this the most full proof that the U.S. side lacks the most basic sincerity for negotiations? Isn't this the most full proof that the reason why the U.S. side was so eager to discuss the prisoner-of-war issue in the first place was a shameful strategy to delay and obstruct the rapid achievement of an agreement on the Third Agenda and all the remaining agenda items? All peace-loving people in the United States and the world should pay serious attention to the U.S. side's despicable conspiracy to delay negotiations.

    新华社记者揭露美方拖延谈判的卑劣阴谋
    美方玩弄交换俘虏资料是一种可耻策略
    全世界一切爱好和平人民应当严重注意
    【新华社开城二十二日电】本社特派记者报道：美方在交换俘虏资料问题上所采取的骇人的敷衍、草率和不负责任的态度，以及美方对我方提出的确实、详尽、完整的俘虏资料所采取的可耻的恶意立场，再一次向全世界提出了一个严重的问题：美方究竟是要解决朝鲜停战问题呢，还是要无限期地拖延以至破坏停战谈判呢？
    如所周知，早在十二月四日，美方代表在第三项议程小组委员会上，即一面拒绝考虑我方提出的公平合理的建议，一面提出一个可疑的要求，说是为了“加速谈判的进行”，建议指定一个小组委员会讨论第四项议程。在这以后，美方代表和它的宣传机构，即天天叫嚷所谓“人道主义的原则”，装出
    一副对他们的被俘人员“非常关怀”的面孔。十二月十一日，我方本着尽一切努力争取达成协议的立场，接受了对方成立第四项议程小组委员会的要求，并提出了真正人道主义的原则，即：双方在停战协议签字后迅速释放全部战俘。十二月十二日，我方又提出了迅速解决第四项议程的五点具体建议。我方这些建议不可辩驳的合理性，使得美方代表也不敢正面反对。但是，他们接着又横生枝节，在第四项议程小组委员会上坚持要求交换战俘资料，作为解决俘虏问题的先决条件。美方代表利比装作愿意迅速在第四项议程上达成协议的样子，在十六日的小组委员会上说：“我们亟愿在接到并研究了我们在十一月二十七日要求的战俘资料以后，立即开始讨论你们的建议和第四项议程。”
    十二月十八日，我方为了解除对方一切阻挠谈判的藉口，同意交换俘虏资料，并向对方提出了完整而充分的俘虏资料，其中包括国籍、军号、级别、部别及俘虏营地点。这些资料都是按照不同情况，分别用朝文和英文编制的。
    反观美方提出的资料，那是总共有二千多页、十二英寸高的一堆废纸。这种资料中除了用英文拚出的所谓俘虏姓名及对方自编的号码以外，其他一切必需的材料——如朝文、中文名单、所属部队番号及级别等，均一概缺如。这种资料的确实性如何，与其说是根本无法查考，毋宁说是立意不要你去查考。美方对于他们首先提出、并坚持很久的交换俘虏资料问题采取这种不能容忍的草率态度，这充分暴露了美方一再要求交换这种资料只是它们玩的一套可鄙的把戏，即以所谓“加速谈判”、“人道主义”、“关心俘虏”等等谎言来作为它们继续拖延和阻挠谈判的遮羞物。
    然而，事情之荒谬奇特者，远不止于此。美方对谈判采取的儿戏态度，还表现在美方对我方所提出的完整而确凿的资料所采取的可耻的态度上。本来，我方资料的确凿性和完整性，连美方某些人物及其同盟国家的官方代表，也不能不加以承认。例如，澳大利亚电台在二十日广播说：“英联邦师师长卡塞尔说，共方宣称俘有九百十九名英军士兵一事，最使人鼓舞，因为当初被宣布失踪的也不过只有一千一百五十人。”广播还说：“英联邦师官员说，共方名册中的六名澳大利亚战俘也便是澳政府过去正式宣布为失踪的六名士兵。”在法军方面，据美联社十八日电透露：“法国军方人士今晚说，法国营方面列入在战斗中失踪的十名战士全都登在共方的战俘名单上。”甚至美方某些人士，在最初也曾经承认我方资料的准确。据美联社东京十八日电透露：“一个可靠方面的人士”比较“军方对于在共军手中的联军士兵数目的估计和共军所交出的数目”说：“我觉得没有多大出入”。国际新闻社东京十九日电也承认：“今日，至少就迄今所研究的一部分共方提出的美军战俘名单看来，名单上的材料是准确的。”
    但是，美国官方人物，却妄图用武断的诽谤来否认我方资料的准确性和完整性。专门以散布谣言、诽谤为能事的所谓联合国军代表团发言人纳科斯，在对我方提出的俘虏资料尚未查对以前，即在十八日晚信口开河地说：“我们对于名单的细节、可靠性、准确性和完全性，都有怀疑的地方。”同日，联合国军司令部更发表一个声明，断言我方“关于战俘的任何资料，都是可疑的。”
    但是美国官方这种否认确凿事实的武断之辞，不但不能减少我方资料的全部价值，而且反使美方自己陷于极端混乱、矛盾和狼狈的境地。美国仆从国家官员的承认姑且不去说它，就是美国国防部经过研究后的承认，也给了纳科斯之流一记清脆的耳光。据法新社消息，美国国防部十九日说，“截至当地时间中午为止，共产党的美军战俘名单中有一半左右的名字已经核对过，错误是很少的”。美国国防部虽然没有勇气说出我方的资料是全部准确的，但是东京李奇微总部的军务处官员在研究我方资料的三分之一后，却无可奈何地承认，我方的“资料是准确的”，而且“姓名、级别及编号，似乎都很对头”。
    美国官方否认我方资料准确性的愚蠢企图，使得他们陷于如此不可救药的混乱当中，以致连李奇微总部和白宫的声明，也发生了尖锐的矛盾。例如，据美国新闻处说：杜鲁门的新闻秘书萧特奉杜鲁门之命，在十九日发表一项声明，要求“每个人以怀疑的态度来对待这项名单（按指我方资料）”。但是，国际新闻社二十日却从东京报道说：“李奇微将军总部今天发现：共方所提出的联军俘虏名单是正确的，起码就这项名单所开列出来的姓名而论是如此。”这样，全世界就看到了一个戏剧性的尴尬场面，东京第一大厦中的李奇微和华盛顿白宫中的杜鲁门互相打起耳光来了。美国侵略者为什么会在这个问题上使自己处于如此混乱和狼狈的地位呢？这是因为美方所玩弄的这个交换俘虏资料以拖延谈判的策略，只是一种愚蠢的伎俩。路透社东京十八日电就透露出了美国侵略者的这一丑剧。该电对朝中方面提出的俘虏资料所将发生的影响，表示忧虑，认为这“正给（美方）谈判代表带来一个沉重的负担”，“带有造成新压力的危险。这些压力可能限制联合国军司令部自如地谈判正式停战协议条件的能力。”该电说：“假如姓名已经公布的战俘的亲属现在知道他们是否能够得到释放要取决于正式停战协议的话，那么司令部在板门店辩论许多其他分歧的问题时，一定会为这些亲属的意见所左右。”显然地，正是由于这个原因，美国的一小撮战争贩子在我方提出俘虏资料后，才不得不慌慌张张地制造出这
    一套漏洞百出的戏法，企图以此来蒙蔽国内人民，以便继续拖延停战谈判。
    美方代表和白宫当局为什么一方面对他自己提出的资料采取绝对不负责任的马虎态度，另一方面又对我方提出的资料采取武断的、颠倒黑白的态度因而陷于极端混乱和尴尬的境地呢，这难道不是最充分地证明美方对于谈判缺乏起码的诚意吗？这难道不是最充分地证明美方当初之所以急于讨论战俘问题，乃是拖延、阻挠迅速地就第三项议程以及其余全部议程获致协议的一种可耻策略吗？美方这种拖延谈判的卑劣阴谋，美国和全世界一切爱好和平的人民应当严重注意。
