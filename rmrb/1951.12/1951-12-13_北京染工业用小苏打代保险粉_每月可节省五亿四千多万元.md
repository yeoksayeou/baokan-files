    Beijing Dyeing Industry Uses Baking Soda to Replace Hydrosulfite
    Monthly Savings Can Exceed 540 Million Yuan

    To the Editor: The experiment of using baking soda to replace hydrosulfite in the Beijing dyeing industry has been successful. The main function of hydrosulfite in dyeing cloth is to remove impurities from the cloth and maintain uniform and bright colors. Hydrosulfite is a foreign product and very expensive, costing 158,000 yuan per kilogram, while baking soda costs only 80,000 yuan per kilogram. Based on dyeing 70,000 bolts of cloth per month (using one kilogram of hydrosulfite or baking soda per ten bolts of cloth), the dyeing industry can save 546 million yuan, and also solve the difficulty of sourcing dyeing materials. In the past, when using hydrosulfite, the cloth had to be dyed and washed twice, which was prone to problems. After using baking soda instead, only one dyeing and one wash are required, and the quality remains bright and beautiful. This experiment was carried out with many difficulties. When baking soda was first used for dyeing cloth, many problems were discovered: dull luster, uneven coloring, excessive red and black edges, and frequent occurrence of streaks. The Beijing Dyeing Industry Technology Research Association convened technicians from various dyeing factories for research, and absorbed advanced experience from various sources. Through continuous experiments, everyone came up with many improvement methods, such as strengthening the concentration of mercerized caustic soda and the number of scouring washes, so that the luster would not become dull; according to the properties of baking soda, adding appropriate amounts of Turkish oil and glucose reduced the streaks. After many efforts by everyone, the experiment of replacing hydrosulfite with baking soda was finally successful.

    北京染工业用小苏打代保险粉
    每月可节省五亿四千多万元
    编辑同志：北京市染工业用小苏打代替保险粉的试验已经成功。保险粉在染布中的作用，主要是洗除布中杂质，保持染色均匀鲜艳。保险粉是外国货，价格很贵，一公斤要十五万八千元，而小苏打
    一公斤只要八万元。以每月染布七万匹计算（染十匹布用保险粉或小苏打一公斤），染工业就可节省五亿四千六百万元，而且解决了染料用料的来源的困难。过去使用保险粉时，必须一染两洗，容易发生毛病；用小苏打代替后，只要一染一洗，质量还保持鲜艳美观。这次试验是经过很多困难的。开始试用小苏打染布时，发现了不少毛病：光泽发暗，上色不匀，红黑边太多，常出花缕等。北京染工业技术研究会召集了各染厂技师进行研究，并多方面吸取先进经验。经过不断的试验，大家想出了许多改进的方法，如加强丝光烧碱的浓度和洗炼次数，使光泽不会发暗；根据小苏打的性质，渗入适当的土耳其油和葡萄糖，减少了花缕。经过大家多次的努力，小苏打代替保险粉的试验终于成功了。
