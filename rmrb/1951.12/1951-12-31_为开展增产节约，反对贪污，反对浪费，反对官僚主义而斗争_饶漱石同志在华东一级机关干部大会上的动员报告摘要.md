To carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and to fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
Excerpts from Comrade Rao Shushi's mobilization report at the conference of first-level cadres in East China
Comrade Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, delivered a mobilization report on "Struggling to Increase Production and Practice Economy, Opposing Corruption, Opposing Waste, and Opposing Bureaucracy" at the conference of first-level cadres in East China convened by the East China Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee on December 17th.

Chairman Rao Shushi first pointed out that since Chairman Mao put forward the great call to "Increase Production, Practice Strict Economy, to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers," people from all walks of life across the country are launching an increase production and practice economy movement with unparalleled enthusiasm. All departments in East China have established streamlining and economizing committees and have carried out preliminary arrangements and inspections; workers and staff in various factories, mines, and enterprises are also highly promoting patriotism and revolutionary heroism, and are looking for ways and methods to launch an increase production and practice economy movement to ensure the completion of the increase production and practice economy plan. Chairman Rao elaborated on the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy, explaining that increasing production and practicing economy is not only a policy to ensure the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and a basic method for accumulating funds and accelerating industrial construction, but also a key to changing customs and establishing a good atmosphere for the country and the people. He called on everyone to strive to implement the central task of increasing production and practicing economy put forward by Chairman Mao, and to work hard to implement the East China's plan for streamlining and economizing in organs, and the 1952 increase production and practice economy plan for financial and economic enterprises.

Chairman Rao then turned the topic to the main enemies of increasing production and practicing economy—corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. He said: "As everyone knows, the People's Government is the most honest government in Chinese history, and the staff of our People's Government (whether they are Communist Party members or non-Communist Party members) are generally honest. Precisely because of this, the People's Government and the staff of the People's Government enjoy a high prestige among the people. Even our enemies have to admit this. This is the main aspect of the ideology and work style of our People's Government and its staff. But we must see the other side, that is, with the victorious development of the revolution, a large number of staff from the old military and political organs have transferred to the People's Government organs to participate in various aspects of work. After more than two years, most of these people have undergone ideological transformation, their work style has changed somewhat, and they are determined to serve the people; however, the old ideas, old habits, and old work styles of some of them have not yet been eliminated. In addition, due to the victory of the revolution, some veteran cadres cannot withstand the test of the new environment and have become infected with bad ideas, bad habits, and bad work styles. The combination of these two types of people has created a bad side among the staff of the People's Government. Although it is not the main side, we can see that the bad habits of corruption, extravagance and waste, and bureaucracy are fiercely attacking the revolutionary ranks, and have infiltrated into the People's Government organs and enterprise organs in many places, and even into the organizations of the fighting Chinese Communist Party in individual places. This is an extremely serious problem and must be taken seriously by every Communist Party member, all staff of the People's Government, and all patriotic people."

Chairman Rao cited some figures and analyzed them. He said: "According to incomplete statistics, from January to November 1951, the corruption cases directly handled by the judicial and supervisory organs at the East China level reached 179, with a total of 28.8 billion yuan in Renminbi. According to the statistics of corruption cases handled by the East China People's Supervision Committee from June 1950 to November 1951, the loss of state property caused by individual corruption amounted to 124.2 billion yuan in Renminbi.

The perpetrators of corruption cases include those who newly joined the work after liberation, such as Wang Canwen, a technician from the business office of the East China Industrial Department, who colluded with private merchants, engaged in illegal trade, obtained materials, and embezzled 2 billion yuan; Li Yuchao, deputy manager of the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation, embezzled 1 billion yuan before and after. Chen Xianfan, deputy director of the planning department of the East China Textile Administration, used his authority to purchase inferior dyes at high prices, and collectively embezzled 3 billion yuan. The perpetrators of corruption cases also include those who participated in the revolution for a long time in the past, such as Lu Xingyuan, the former director of the engineering office of the East China Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, who is a typical example. In September 1950, he met the profiteer Li Dewei (manager of Shanghai Diantong Auction House) due to the purchase of equipment. Li frequently invited Lu to banquets, entered and exited dance halls, bribed him extensively, and induced Lu Xingyuan to get acquainted with another profiteer, Feng Ping, and even cohabit with her. In the collective corruption case of Zhou Qian and 85 others in the Changzhou Taxation Bureau, the discovered materials prove that 300 merchants bribed them, evading more than 1.6 billion yuan in taxes.

These examples are enough to prove that corrupt elements and profiteers are pests of the people's revolutionary cause, and thieves who steal the property of the state and the people."

Chairman Rao asked: "Think about it, everyone: Our heroic People's Volunteers are engaged in such arduous struggles on the Korean front, protecting the peace and security of our motherland, but these pests are stealing state property in the rear, can we all tolerate it? Our hardworking workers and peasants are working selflessly day and night, creating wealth for the country and the people, but these pests are stealing state property, can we all tolerate it? The vast majority of the staff of our People's Liberation Army and state organs and enterprise organs are still living a hard life, serving the motherland and the people wholeheartedly, but these pests are stealing state property, can we all tolerate it? Especially today, when the people of the whole country are practicing strict economy and increasing production, if we do not punish such criminals, how can we guarantee that the wealth we increase production and save will not be stolen by them for their own personal gain?"

Chairman Rao then spoke about the phenomenon of waste. He said: "Waste and corruption are somewhat different in nature, but the loss of state property due to waste is often greater than that due to corruption. According to the statistics of only four departments, the East China Textile Administration, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Health, and the East China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, the losses caused by waste of raw materials, production of defective products, substandard goods, and blind production amounted to 224.5 billion yuan in Renminbi. The loss of mildew and deterioration of warehouse materials is also extremely serious. For example, the mildew and deterioration losses of only five major materials in the materials stored in the first warehouse of the East China Branch of the National Warehouse Material Clearing and Allocation Committee are calculated to be more than 11 billion yuan. The Shanghai Grain Company had 11.8 million catties of rice deteriorate, resulting in a loss of 3.24 billion yuan. Waste also occurs in the personal lives of some senior cadres, as well as in meetings, banquets, and gift-giving in organs. Those cadres who pursue extravagance and waste in life have not yet developed to the point of being degenerate and embezzling state property like corrupt elements, but their ideology, work style, and lifestyle have been infected with the habits of landlords, compradors, and bureaucrats, and have been influenced by bourgeois ideology. They regard the habits of landlords, compradors, and bureaucrats as "generous" and "magnanimous," and regard the work style of the bourgeoisie as "ostentatious" and "generous"; they satirize the hard and simple work style of the working class and Communist Party members as "conservatism," "country bumpkins," and "rural views"; they think that they cannot express their "revolutionary friendship" without giving gifts or hosting banquets; their enthusiasm for work is not as enthusiastic as they are for sofas and cars. They do not feel ashamed that their ideology and work style are deviating from the people, the working class, and the Communist Party, and gradually approaching, getting close to, and assimilating with landlords, compradors, bureaucrats, and profiteers, but instead take it as an honor. These extravagant and wasteful elements, because they pursue personal enjoyment in life, have lost their ambition to move forward in their minds, lost their sense of responsibility for the people's cause, and lost their sensitivity to new things, and their political sense of smell is becoming increasingly dull. Therefore, they are increasingly separated from the masses and afraid of criticism and self-criticism. The feet of this kind of person have already stepped on the edge of degeneration and deterioration, and if they do not wake up quickly, there is a danger of falling into the mire of corruption and degeneration."

In terms of opposing bureaucracy, Chairman Rao pointed out: "Bureaucracy is the breeding ground for the existence and development of corruption and waste, so in order to completely eliminate the phenomena of corruption and waste, we must resolutely oppose bureaucracy."

Chairman Rao called on all staff in East China to resolutely take the following six measures in order to completely eliminate the influence of the reactionary thoughts of landlords, compradors, bureaucrats, and profiteers, maintain the purity of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and at the same time save all possible staff and cadres: (1) Conduct universal ideological education against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and expose and refute all incorrect ideas that hinder this struggle. (2) Launch a mass democratic inspection movement, adopt the methods of calling on corrupt elements to confess voluntarily, mobilizing the masses to report and accuse, and launching criticism and self-criticism to expose all phenomena of corruption, extravagance and waste, and bureaucracy. (3) Make full use of various propaganda tools to expose and criticize typical figures and events of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and introduce, commend, and reward model figures and deeds of integrity and public service, protecting the interests of the state and the people, and actively creating wealth for the state and the people. (4) Strengthen the leadership of the increase production and practice economy committees at all levels, and the heads of all organs and units must personally lead, rely on the masses, and promote democracy. (5) Mobilize the masses of people from all walks of life to report and expose corrupt elements and illegal merchants, and call on them to confess. (6) Conscientiously rectify the organizational structure of organs at all levels and establish a regular inspection system.

When talking about exposing and refuting various incorrect ideas, Chairman Rao refuted the erroneous ideas such as "the revolution has been successful, and we can enjoy life," "we should learn to be 'generous' and 'magnanimous' after entering the city," and "we have made contributions to the revolution in the past, and it is forgivable to embezzle a little." He said: "The so-called 'the revolution has been successful, and we can enjoy life' is precisely the ideology of the bourgeoisie, not the ideology of the working class and the Communist Party. Because the historical fact is that when the bourgeoisie seizes power, it immediately turns around and becomes the enemy of the working people and an obstacle to social development. But the working class is different. The proletariat, which takes the realization of socialism and communism as its own responsibility, is not at the end of the revolution after leading the people to seize power, but only at the beginning of the revolution. Chairman Mao said: The victory of our revolution is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles. The so-called learning to be 'generous' and 'magnanimous' after entering the city is openly asking the cadres of our party and the staff of the People's Government to abandon their fine traditions of hard work and simplicity, and to learn the decadent thoughts of the reactionary class. The so-called 'past revolutionary contributions can be forgiven' is also wrong. The contribution of a revolutionary cadre comes from the arduous revolutionary struggle to serve the people, and this contribution is worthy of reward and praise. But when he turns to corruption and degeneration and becomes a thief who steals the property of the people, what can he be rewarded and praised for? If we forgive corrupt elements, we are forgiving crime, we are encouraging degeneration, we are burying cadres, we are betraying the interests of the people, and there is a danger of national subjugation, party destruction, and head loss."

When talking about the democratic inspection movement, Chairman Rao pointed out: "All informants should be given practical guarantees, and all acts of obstructing, sabotaging, or suppressing reports should be punished. All those who have made meritorious contributions in reporting should be commended and rewarded, and special agencies should be established to handle this matter. We want to warn all corrupt elements! All acts of corruption and theft of state property are crimes and should be subject to due punishment, from warnings, transfers, dismissal, imprisonment to the death penalty. Those who confess can be given reduced or exempted punishment, and those who refuse to confess will be given heavier punishment. For the facts of corruption reported and voluntarily confessed, those who have transferred from the Kuomintang old agencies to the People's Government and newly joined personnel can be counted from the date of liberation, and veteran cadres who have undergone rectification and three investigations can be counted from the time they entered the city. For serious bureaucrats who have not noticed serious corruption and waste phenomena in their units beforehand, and do not strictly punish them afterwards, even if they have not participated in corruption or waste, they should also be dealt with for dereliction of duty and will not be forgiven."

At the end of the report, Chairman Rao called on all personnel to, under Chairman Mao's ever-victorious banner, in the great patriotic increase production and practice economy movement, vigorously attack the enemies of the people—corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and advance courageously to continue the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and to build our great motherland.

    为开展增产节约，反对贪污，反对浪费，反对官僚主义而斗争
    饶漱石同志在华东一级机关干部大会上的动员报告摘要
    华东军政委员会主席饶漱石十二月十七日在华东增产节约委员会召开的华东一级机关干部大会上，作了“为开展增产节约，反对贪污，反对浪费，反对官僚主义而斗争”的动员报告。
    饶漱石主席首先指出：自从毛主席提出“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召以来，全国各界人民正在以无比的热忱展开增产节约运动。华东各机关都成立了精简节约委员会，并进行了初步的布置和检查；各工厂矿山企业部门的工人和职员也正在高度发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义，从各方面寻找途径和方法来展开增产节约运动，保证完成增产节约的计划。饶主席详细阐述了增产节约的重大意义，说明增产节约不但是保障抗美援朝战争胜利的方针，是积累资金、加速工业建设的基本办法，而且也是移风易俗，树立国家和人民良好风气的主要关键，号召大家为贯彻毛主席所提出的增产节约的中心任务而奋斗，为贯彻执行华东所制定的机关精简节约方案、和财经企业部门一九五二年增产节约方案而努力。
    饶主席随即把题目转到增产节约的主要敌人——贪污、浪费和官僚主义方面。他说：“大家都知道：人民政府是中国有史以来最廉洁的政府，我们人民政府中的工作人员（不论是共产党员或非共产党员）一般的也是廉洁的，正因为如此，人民政府和人民政府的工作人员，在人民群众中享有很高的威信。这一点，连我们的敌人也不得不承认。这是我们人民政府及其工作人员的思想作风的主要方面。但我们必须看到另外一面，这就是随着革命的胜利发展，大批的旧的军政机关的工作人员转到人民政府机关中参加各方面的工作。这一部分人经过两年多的时间，大多数都进行了思想改造，作风有所转变，决心为人民服务了；但其中还有一部分人的旧思想、旧习惯、旧作风还没有清除。另外，由于革命的胜利，一部分老干部经不起新环境的考验，而沾染上了坏思想、坏习惯、坏作风。这两种人相结合，便造成了在人民政府工作人员中的坏的一面。虽然它不是主要的一面，但是，我们可以看到：贪污腐化、铺张浪费和官僚主义的恶劣作风正在猛烈地侵袭着革命队伍，并且在许多地方已经侵入到人民政府机关和企业机关里面，甚至在个别地方侵入了战斗的中国共产党的组织里面来，这是一个极为严重的问题，必须引起每个共产党员、一切人民政府的工作人员和全体爱国人民严加警惕。”
    饶主席举出一些数字，并加以分析。他说：“根据不完全统计，一九五一年一月到十一月止，华东一级司法及监察机关所直接处理的贪污案件，即达一百七十九件，贪污总数达人民币二百八十八亿元。又据华东人民监察委员会自一九五零年六月至一九五一年十一月处理贪污案件的统计，因个人贪污而造成国家财产的损失，数达人民币一千二百四十二亿元。
    贪污案犯属于解放后新参加工作的，如华东工业部经理处技术人员王灿文，勾结私商，非法贸易，套购物资，贪污二十亿元；中国油脂公司浙江省公司副经理李郁超前后贪污十亿元。华东纺织管理局计划处副处长陈贤凡利用职权以高价购买劣等染料，集体贪污三十亿元。贪污案犯属于过去参加革命较久的，如前华东上海人民广播电台工务室主任路星元就是一个典型的例子，他在一九五零年九月因购买器材关系认识了奸商李德维（上海电通拍卖行经理），李即经常地邀路赴宴，出入舞厅，大量贿赂，并引诱路星元与另一奸商冯萍结识以至姘居。常州税务局周谦等八十五人的集体贪污案件中，已发现的材料证明有三百家商号贿赂他们，逃税十六亿余元。
    这些例子，已经足够证明贪污分子与奸商是人民革命事业的害虫，是窃取国家和人民财产的盗贼。”
    饶主席问道：“大家想想看：我们英勇的人民志愿军在朝鲜前线进行着那样艰苦的斗争，保卫着我们祖国的和平与安全，这些害虫却在后方盗窃国家的财产，我们大家能够容忍吗？我们勤劳的工人和农民，日日夜夜地忘我地劳动，为国家和人民创造财富，这些害虫却在盗窃国家的财产，我们大家能够容忍吗？我们人民解放军和国家机关、企业机关的绝大部分工作人员仍然过着清苦的生活，全心全意地为祖国和人民服务，这些害虫却在盗窃国家的财产，我们大家能够容忍吗？特别是在今天，当全国人民厉行节约增加生产的时候，如果不惩办这种罪犯，我们怎样能够保证我们增产节约的财富不被他们盗窃肥私呢？”
    饶主席接着说到浪费现象。他说：“浪费和贪污在性质上有若干不同，但浪费对国家财产的损失往往大于贪污。仅据华东纺织管理局、工业部、卫生部、新华书店华东总分店四个部门的统计，因浪费原材料、生产废品，次货及盲目生产所造成的损失，即达人民币二千二百四十五亿元。仓库物资霉烂的损失也极严重。如全国仓库物资清理调配委员会华东分会第一仓库储存物资中仅以五项主要物资的霉烂损失计算，即达一百十亿元以上。上海粮食公司有一千一百八十万斤大米变质，损失三十二亿四千万元。浪费现象也发生在一部分高级干部个人生活方面，以及机关的开会、请客、送礼等等方面。那些追求生活上铺张浪费的干部虽然还没有和贪污分子一样发展到堕落蜕化、盗窃国家财产的地步，但在他们的意识形态上、工作作风上、生活方式上已经沾染了地主买办官僚的习气，已经受着资产阶级思想的影响。他们以地主买办官僚习气为
    “大方”“大气”，以资产阶级的作风为“排场”
    “慷慨”；他们讽刺工人阶级和共产党员艰苦朴素的作风为“保守主义”，为“土包子”，为“农村观点”；他们以为不送礼、不请客就不能表示他们的“革命友爱”；他们对工作的积极性，不如对沙发、汽车那样热心。他们不以自己的思想作风一天天地脱离人民，脱离工人阶级，脱离共产党，逐渐向着地主、买办、官僚、奸商靠拢、接近和同化为耻，而反以为荣。这些铺张浪费的分子，由于在生活上追求个人的享受，因而在思想上丧失了前进心，丧失了对人民事业的责任心，丧失了对新鲜事物的敏感，政治嗅觉一天天的迟钝，因而他们一天天脱离群众，害怕批评与自我批评。这种人的脚已经踏到堕落变质的边缘，如不迅速猛醒，就有掉下贪污蜕化的泥坑的危险。”在反对官僚主义方面，饶主席指出：“官僚主义是贪污、浪费得以存在和发展的温床，所以为了彻底肃清贪污、浪费现象，便必须坚决反对官僚主义。”
    饶主席号召全华东机关工作人员为了彻底肃清地主、买办、官僚、奸商反动思想的影响，保持共产党和人民政府的纯洁，同时为了挽救一切可能挽救的工作人员和干部，坚决采取下列六项措施：（1）普遍进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的思想教育，揭露和驳斥一切障碍这一斗争的不正确思想。
    （2）展开群众性的民主检查运动，采取号召贪污分子自动坦白，发动群众检举控告，及展开批评与自我批评的方法，来揭发一切贪污腐化、铺张浪费和官僚主义的现象。（3）充分运用各种宣传工具，揭发和批判贪污、浪费及官僚主义的典型人物和事件，介绍表扬和奖励廉洁奉公、保卫国家人民利益及积极为国家和人民创造财富的模范人物和事迹。（4）健全各级增产节约委员会的领导，各机关各单位首长必须亲自领导，依靠群众，发扬民主。
    （5）发动社会各界人民群众检举揭发贪污分子及不法商人，并号召他们进行坦白。（6）切实整顿各级机关的组织机构与建立经常的检查制度。
    在讲到揭露和驳斥各种不正确思想时，饶主席驳斥了“革命已经成功了，在生活上可以享受”，“进城后应当学习‘大方’‘大气’”，“对革命有过功劳，贪污一点可以原谅”等错误思想。他说：“所谓‘革命已经成功了，可以享受’，正是资产阶级的思想，而不是工人阶级和共产党的思想。因为历史上的事实是，当资产阶级夺得政权以后，就立即反转头来变成为劳动人民的敌人，变成为社会发展的障碍。而工人阶级则不同，以实现社会主义和共产主义为己任的无产阶级，在领导人民取得政权后，并不是革命走到尽头，而仅仅是革命的开始。毛主席说：我们革命的胜利，仅仅是万里长征走完了第一步。所谓在进城后要学‘大方’‘大气’，这就是公开地要我党干部和人民政府工作人员抛弃自己艰苦朴素的优良传统，而来学习反动阶级的腐朽思想。所谓‘过去革命有过功劳可以原谅’的说法，也是错误的。一个革命干部的功劳是在为人民服务的艰苦的革命斗争中得来的，这种功劳才值得奖励和称赞。可是当他走向贪污蜕化、变成为盗窃人民财产的盗贼时，他还有什么可以奖励和称赞呢？如果我们原谅贪污分子，就是原谅犯罪，就是鼓励堕落，就是葬送干部，就是出卖人民利益，就有亡国、亡党、亡头的危险。”
    在讲到民主检举运动时，饶主席指出：“应给一切检举者以切实的保障，对一切阻挠、破坏或压制检举的行为应给予处罚，对一切检举有功者给予表扬和奖励，并设立专门机构办理此事。我们要对一切贪污分子提出警告！一切贪污、盗窃国家财产的行为都是犯罪，都应受到应得的处分，从警告、调职、撤职、判处徒刑直到死刑。坦白者可以减轻或免予处分，对拒不坦白的则加重处分。检举和自动坦白的贪污事实，凡从国民党旧机构转到人民政府的工作人员及新参加工作的人员可从解放之日算起，凡经过整风、三查的老干部可从进入城市之时算起。对于各个单位中发生了严重的贪污现象和浪费现象而事前毫无觉察，事后又不厉行惩治的严重官僚主义分子，虽然其本人没有参加贪污或浪费行为，也应以失职论处，决不宽恕。”
    饶主席在报告结束时号召全体人员在毛主席的百战百胜的旗帜下，在伟大的爱国增产节约运动中，大张旗鼓地向人民的敌人——贪污、浪费和官僚主义进攻，为继续进行伟大的抗美援朝斗争，为建设我们伟大的祖国而英勇前进。
