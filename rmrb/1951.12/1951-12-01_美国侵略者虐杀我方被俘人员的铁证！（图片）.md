American aggressors barbarically murder and mistreat our captured personnel. The two photos printed here were taken by the American invading army themselves and published in the American "Newsweek" on October 2nd and 9th, 1950, to flaunt their barbarity and shamelessness. The upper picture shows American murderers stripping our captured personnel naked, surrounding them with tanks and various weapons, and forcing them to raise their hands. The lower picture shows our captured personnel being pushed into a pit to be buried alive.

    美国侵略者虐杀我方被俘人员的铁证！
    美国侵略者对待我方的被俘人员野蛮地加以杀害和虐待。这里所刊载的两张照片，是美国侵略军自己摄制，刊载于一九五○年十月二日和九日在美国出版的“新闻周刊”上，以炫示它们的野蛮和无耻。上图是美国杀人犯将我方被俘人员剥光衣服，用坦克车和各种武器包围他们，迫令举起手来。下图是把我方被俘人员推在土坑中准备活埋。
