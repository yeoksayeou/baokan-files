    “1951 Weaving Method” is our Good Magic Weapon for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Tianjin Special-Class Labor Model  Wang Deshan
    Chairman Mao has called on us to increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Now our weaving workers have found a way to realize this great call, and that is the "1951 Weaving Method." This is a great happy event for our weaving workers across the country! I participated in the measurement and summarization of the "1951 Weaving Method." This has made me more clearly aware of the direction of our weaving workers' efforts.
    For many years, our weaving workers had no standard rules for work. Everyone had their own set of methods, and no one knew what was good about theirs, or what was bad about theirs. It was all blind groping, which was strenuous and unrewarding. Now we want to build national defense, we want to develop production, we want to increase strength for resisting America and aiding Korea, so that kind of blind work is of course no good! Understanding this point, in the summary, representatives from all over the country were determined: "Bring out your own strengths and absorb the strengths of others." Therefore, the "1951 Weaving Method" concentrated the strengths of weaving workers from all over the country and became the most advanced weaving method. In the nearly three years since the liberation of Tianjin, I have not woven substandard cloth, and I also have my own operating methods (basic movements). But my methods of changing shuttles and joining threads are not as regular as the "1951 Weaving Method," and the segmentation is not as detailed as the "1951 Weaving Method." After absorbing the basic spirit of the "1951 Weaving Method," after preliminary testing, I can now watch twelve ordinary looms. Before, I could only watch eight.
   “1951 Weaving Method” can not only improve output and quality, and reduce labor intensity, but also reduce waste yarn and thread ends, and save cotton yarn. Facts have proved that the "1951 Weaving Method" is a magic weapon for every weaving worker. The representative from the Northwest region originally only watched two looms, but after learning the "1951 Weaving Method," they were able to watch eight. Ge Fangxian of our state-owned Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory originally watched six looms, but after learning it, he watched ten and still felt very relaxed.
    We want to thank the Communist Party, thank the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, thank the correct leadership of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, thank them for summarizing this set of magic weapons for our weaving workers, and pointing out the direction of progress for our textile workers across the country.
    I want to work with the weaving worker brothers and sisters across the country to master this powerful weapon for increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's great call! (Recorded by Xin Ru)

### “一九五一织布工作法”是我们增产节约的好法宝

    “一九五一织布工作法”是我们增产节约的好法宝
    天津市特等劳动模范  王德山
    毛主席号召我们增加生产，厉行节约，支持中国人民志愿军。现在我们织布工人已经找到了一个实现这个伟大号召的办法了，这就是“一九五一织布工作法”。这是我们全国织布工人的一件大喜事！我参加了“一九五一织布工作法”的测定、总结。这使我更明确地认识到我们织布工人的努力方向。
    多少年来，我们织布工人干活就没什么准规矩，人人各有一套，谁好也不知好在那儿，谁坏也不知坏在那儿，瞎摸乱碰费力不讨好。现在咱们要建设国防，咱们要发展生产，咱们要给抗美援朝增加力量，那种盲目干法当然不行啦！懂得了这一点，在总结当中我们全国各地代表都抱定了一个决心： “拿出自己的长处，吸取别人的长处。”因此，“一九五一织布工作法”就集中了全国各地织布工人的长处，成为最先进的织布工作法。天津解放后将近三年内，我没织过次布，我也有自己的操作方法（基本动作）。可是我的换梭、接头等方法就不如“一九五一织布工作法”有那么强的规律性，分段也没“一九五一织布工作法”那么细致。吸取了“一九五一织布工作法”的基本精神以后，初步试验，我已经可以看十二台普通布机了。在以前我才能看八台。
   “一九五一织布工作法”不但可以提高产量、质量，减轻劳动强度，还可以减少回丝、线头，节约棉纱。事实已经证明“一九五一织布工作法”是咱们织布工人人人的法宝。西北地区的代表原来只看二台布机，学了“一九五一织布工作法”后就能看八台了。我们国营天津第二棉纺织厂的葛方贤，原来看六台布机，学完后看十台他还觉得很轻松。
    我们要感谢共产党，感谢中央人民政府纺织工业部，感谢中国纺织工会全国委员会的正确领导，感谢他们为咱织布工人总结出这套法宝，给咱们全国纺织工人指出了进步的方向。
    我要和全国织布工人弟兄们一道，好好掌握这支增产节约的有力武器，为实现毛主席的伟大号召而努力！　（昕如记）
