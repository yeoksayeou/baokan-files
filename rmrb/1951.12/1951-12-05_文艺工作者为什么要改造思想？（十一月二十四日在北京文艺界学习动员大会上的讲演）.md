The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has decided to lead Beijing's literary and art workers in a study on the direction of literary and artistic work to remold their ideology and improve their work. This study is urgently needed. Since the literary and art circles have raised the issue of direction, it is evident that, at least among some leading staff in the literary and art circles, there is no firm and clear answer to this question. If this is the case, if some leading literary and art staff still have doubts about the direction of their actions, how can they move forward?

The fact is precisely this. Although the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in July 1949 had already declared its acceptance of the direction indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, this does not mean that, without the specific and profound ideological struggle like the one conducted in the literary and art circles in the liberated areas around 1942, this direction would be genuinely, naturally, and unanimously accepted by literary and art workers nationwide. Some writers who raised their hands at the 1949 Congress did not truly understand the content of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on literary and artistic work. They still held petty-bourgeois or bourgeois views on literary and art. Therefore, when they heard that our literature and art should use the worldview of the working class to educate the entire people, to criticize the worldview of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and thus also use the literary and art perspective of the working class to criticize the literary and art perspective of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, they were surprised, feeling that the "policy had changed." And with them were some Communist Party literary and art workers, including even a few who had expressed their support for Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and art policy at the Yan'an Forum. After these comrades came into contact with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois writers, they lost their ability to criticize them and "united" with them unconditionally. In the eyes of these comrades, there could be no struggle within the literary and art circles, and literary and art workers educated by the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie could "serve the people" without undergoing ideological remolding. Under the influence of these two groups of people, the progress of our literary and artistic work in the past two years has been significantly limited.

Of course, our literary and artistic work has made considerable achievements in the past two years, which cannot be doubted, because not only do these two groups of people not represent the entirety of the literary and art circles, but even these two groups of people have done more or less work that is beneficial to the people. However, I do not intend to say much about this here, because that is not the task of today's meeting. Today, we need to look more at the other side of things. Today, we universally feel the inadequacy of works, and most of the existing works cannot resonate with the new life of the working people. These works often lack new characters, new events, new emotions, and new themes, and often become anti-realist because they distort the image and struggle of the working people, or because they abstract and formulaize the image and struggle of the working people (becoming anti-historicist when depicting history); is this not a fact? Related to this phenomenon is the lack of connection of many writers with the working people, holding an indifferent attitude towards the cause of the working people, showing laziness in creation, producing shoddy work, or abandoning creation and indulging in administrative affairs and social activities, and in individual cases even simply living a life of idleness and dissipation; is this not a fact? Still related to this phenomenon is that many, or all, literary and art organizations, since their establishment in 1949, have not seriously organized the creative activities of writers, nor have they seriously organized writers to participate in the struggles of the masses, nor have they seriously organized the study of writers, whether political or artistic; is this not a fact? People say that there is too much criticism, too harsh criticism, and writers dare not write. But what is the reality? Completely the opposite. All the above phenomena have not arisen in the context of the development of criticism, but in the context of extreme underdevelopment of criticism. Speaking of criticism, we cannot but mention the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun." As everyone knows, the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" was not initiated by any literary and art organization, but by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Many important figures in the literary and art circles, if not supporting the production, screening, and promotion of "The Life of Wu Xun," also tolerated these, and some people even held a passive attitude towards this criticism even after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China initiated the criticism. After the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," criticism in the literary and art circles became more active, but to this day, except for the editorial departments of some literary and art publications, there is still no literary and art organization that regards regularly organizing criticism and self-criticism as its task. Is this phenomenon tolerable? But why has this phenomenon been able to exist for two years?

Many leading staff in the literary and art circles have obviously forgotten the basic Marxist view that literature and art are the superstructure of a certain economic base of society. What is the role of the superstructure? Stalin said:

"The superstructure is produced by the base, but this does not mean that the superstructure merely reflects the base, merely passive, neutral, indifferent to the fate of its base, to the fate of its class, to the nature of the system. On the contrary, once the superstructure emerges, it becomes a tremendous active force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of its base, taking all measures to help the new system eradicate and eliminate the old base and the old class.
It cannot be otherwise. The reason why the base creates its superstructure is precisely to make the superstructure serve it, to make the superstructure actively help it to form and consolidate, to make the superstructure actively fight to eliminate the outdated old base and its old superstructure. As long as the superstructure refuses to fulfill its role of serving the base, as long as the superstructure goes from the position of actively defending its base to a position of indifference to its base, to a position of treating all classes equally, it will lose its essence and cease to be a superstructure." (Stalin: "On Marxism in Linguistics")

The fact that our literary and art cause has not become a "tremendous active force," and has not been able to mobilize the fearless labor spirit and fighting spirit of the broad literary and art workers, is it not precisely because some leading personnel have adopted a non-Marxist view of literature and art? Abandoning or relaxing the class struggle in the field of literature and art, not understanding the literary and art cause as a serious cause of class struggle, but making it "go from the position of actively defending its base to a position of indifference to its base, to a position of treating all classes equally," is this not the true source of all the dangerous phenomena in the current literary and art circles?

Many leading staff in the literary and art circles have also obviously forgotten Comrade Mao Zedong's basic instructions at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. Like Stalin's opinion mentioned above, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at this forum: the fundamental task of literature and art is to "become a component part of the whole revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: in order to correctly complete this task of literature and art, literary and art workers must stand on the position of the working class, and those who have not yet stood on the position of the working class must strive to transform themselves, so as to "change from one class to another." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to integrate with the masses, you must make a determination and go through a long and even painful process of tempering... We literary and art workers of intellectual origin, if we want our works to be welcomed by the masses, we must undergo a change in our thoughts and feelings, and a transformation. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be incompatible." At the end of his conclusion at this forum, Comrade Mao Zedong sharply pointed out the principled significance of this ideological remolding:

"People of petty-bourgeois origin always stubbornly express themselves and promote their own views through various methods, including literary and art methods, demanding that people transform the Party and transform the world according to the image of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. In this situation, our task is to shout loudly at them, saying: 'Comrades,' your set is not feasible, the proletariat and the masses of the people cannot accommodate you, and if we follow you, we are actually following the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there is a danger of losing the Party, the country, and our heads. Who can we rely on? We can only transform the Party and transform the world according to the image of the proletariat and its vanguard. We hope that the comrades in the literary and art circles will recognize the seriousness of this great debate, actively participate in this struggle, and make every comrade sound, both to the enemy, to friends, to comrades, and to ourselves, so that our entire team will be truly unified and consolidated ideologically and organizationally."

Are Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions not equally applicable today? In today's revolutionary literary and art circles, is there not an even greater encirclement of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought? Today's China is a people's democratic China, which means that today's democracy is led by the working class. But this does not mean that the leadership of the working class can exist naturally, let alone that the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie can stop their activities of transforming the world according to their own image; no, this is impossible. Whether on the literary and art front or on other ideological fronts, the working class must strive for its own leading position while uniting the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie; it must criticize the errors of these ideas while acknowledging the legitimate status of bourgeois thought and petty-bourgeois thought in today's society, pointing out that these ideas can never assume the leading responsibility for transforming the world. The working class must insist on transforming the world according to its own image, transforming the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and not allow itself to be lowered to the ideological level of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie to "serve" them. To abandon this ideological struggle is to abandon the leadership of the working class, is to abandon the cause of people's democracy. The result will be not only to break away from the working masses, but also to break away from the broad masses of the people outside the working class, but who are already under the leadership of the working class today, because these masses, based on their own experience and awareness, have already believed that only the revolutionary working-class thought can truly point them to a bright future, not the thought of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. Like the working masses, they also demand that our literature and art guide them to look forward, not backward.

Therefore, literary and art workers, who exert a major leading role in the spiritual life of our people, cannot but strive to stand on the position of the working class, and cannot but strive to establish close ties with the working people. Only by going to the masses with a revolutionary attitude, integrating with the masses, and fully understanding the lives, struggles, thoughts, and feelings of the masses, can we bring the creative demands, imagination, themes, and subjects from the masses, and then write authentic revolutionary works, and let the works go to the masses to serve the masses. Only in this way will our literary and artistic creation be vigorous, will it embark on the road of realism and get rid of the迷途of anti-realism, will it be welcomed by the masses, will it grasp the masses, and will it become a "tremendous active force."

It can be seen from this that the primary issue in the current literary and artistic work, fundamentally speaking, is to establish the ideological leadership of the working class and to help the broad non-working class literary and art workers to carry out ideological remolding. Without solving this problem, the solution of other problems is impossible.

So, what is the way out for the current literary and art circles?

The way out is: first, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, seriously carry out the study of ideological remolding, study Marxism, and combine it with the worker-peasant-soldier masses. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has designated several appropriate documents and stipulated that the method of criticism and self-criticism should be adopted in the study, so as to facilitate the literary and art workers to distinguish between right and wrong and determine their position, which is very good. We hope that this study can be carried out seriously, as a beginning for many literary and art workers to break away from the non-working-class position and obtain the working-class position.

Second, fully publicize Marxist literary and art thought, criticize anti-Marxist literary and art thought; make everyone thoroughly realize that the literary and art cause is an important part of the working class's class struggle cause, it cannot be indifferent to the cause of the working class and the masses of the people, or treat all classes equally, but must become a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy under the leadership of the working class; make everyone thoroughly realize that literary and art workers must closely connect with the working people, and find the source of creation from the lives and struggles of the working people.

Third, rectify the leadership of the literary and art cause. Since our literary and art cause is the ideological struggle cause of the working class, its leadership cannot but be ideological leadership, and cannot but be the leadership of creation and criticism. Therefore, we must oppose the unthinking, vulgar liberalism and bureaucratic work style in the literary and art leadership work, we must expand and strengthen the leadership of creation and criticism, and reduce all administrative affairs that can be reduced, so as to narrow but also strengthen the literary and art administrative work.

Fourth, rectify the literary and art organizations, so that every literary and art organization that truly has a need to exist can become a fighting organization, and can effectively help literary and art workers to combine with the working people, and organize the creation, criticism, and study activities of literary and art workers. Literary and art organizations that cannot do this should be declared disbanded; "literary and art workers" who cannot actually engage in literary and art labor should be expelled by the literary and art organizations to which they belong.

Fifth, rectify literary and art publications, first of all, rectify literary and art periodicals. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has made a brave decision to rectify literary and art periodicals, and hopes that this decision can be implemented resolutely and quickly, and hopes that future literary and art periodicals can fight against shoddy work and improve the ideological and artistic quality of literary and art works.

Sixth, require Communist Party literary and art workers to become models in all the above activities, that is, to become models in studying Marxism, to become models in combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, to become models in practicing criticism and self-criticism, and to become models in literary and art labor, and to oppose any undisciplined phenomena of Party member literary and art workers.

Comrades! As long as we take these steps seriously, we will surely achieve our goal. Let us unite as one and raise the banner of literature and art of the People's Republic of China even higher!

### 文艺工作者为什么要改造思想？（十一月二十四日在北京文艺界学习动员大会上的讲演）

    文艺工作者为什么要改造思想？
    （十一月二十四日在北京文艺界学习动员大会上的讲演）
    胡乔木
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会决定领导北京文艺工作者进行一次关于文艺工作方向问题的学习，借以改造思想，改进工作。这个学习是迫切需要的。文艺界既然提出了方向问题，可见至少在文艺界的一部分领导工作人员中，对于这个问题还没有坚决的明确的答复；而如果是这样，如果一部分文艺界领导工作人员对于自己行动的方向还有怀疑，那么，他们怎样好前进呢？
    事实正是这样。虽然一九四九年七月全国文学艺术工作者代表大会就已经宣布了接受毛泽东同志在一九四二年延安文艺座谈会上所指示的方向，但是这并不是说，不经过像一九四二年前后在解放区文艺界进行过的那样具体的深刻的思想斗争，这个方向就真的会被全国文学艺术工作者所自然而然地毫无异议地接受。一部分在一九四九年大会上举过手的作家，并没有真正了解毛泽东同志关于文艺工作的指示的内容，他们对于文艺工作仍然抱着小资产阶级或资产阶级的见解。所以当他们听说我们的文学艺术要以工人阶级的人生观世界观去教育全体人民，去批评资产阶级小资产阶级的人生观世界观，因此也就要以工人阶级的文学艺术观去批评资产阶级小资产阶级的文学艺术观的时候，他们就惊异起来，觉得似乎是“方针变了”。而和他们在一起的，还有一些共产党员文艺工作者，其中甚至也包括少数在延安文艺座谈会上表示过拥护毛泽东同志的文艺方针的共产党员。这些同志在和资产阶级小资产阶级文艺家接触以后，失去了对于他们的批判能力，而跟他们无条件地“团结”起来了。在这些同志看来，文艺界内部可以没有斗争，受资产阶级小资产阶级教育的文艺家可以不经过改造而“为人民服务”。就在这两部分人的影响下，我们两年来的文学艺术工作的进展受了重大的限制。
    当然，两年来我们的文学艺术工作有不小的成绩，这是不能怀疑的，因为不但这两部分人并不是文学艺术界的全体，而且就是这两部分人也作了或多或少的对人民有益的工作。但是这一点我不打算在这里多说，因为这不是今天的会议的任务。今天我们需要多看看另外一方面的事情。我们今天普遍感觉作品的不足，而已经有的作品，多数不能和劳动人民的新生活互相呼应，这些作品往往缺少新的人物，新的事件，新的感情，新的主题，并且往往因为歪曲了劳动人民的形象和斗争，或者因为把劳动人民的形象和斗争抽象化公式化了，成为反现实主义的东西（在描写历史的时候就成为反历史主义的东西）；这难道不是事实吗？同这种现象相联系的，是许多作家同劳动人民缺少联系，对于劳动人民的事业抱着淡漠态度，在创作上表现怠工，粗制滥造，或者放弃创作而醉心于行政事务和交际活动，个别的甚至简直饱食终日，行为放荡；这难道不是事实吗？仍然是同这种现象相联系的，是许多，或者所有，文学艺术团体，自从一九四九年成立以来，就没有认真地组织过作家的创作活动，也没有认真地组织过作家参加人民群众的斗争，也没有认真地组织过作家的学习，无论是政治的或是艺术的学习；这难道不是事实吗？人们说，批评得太多啦，太严厉啦，作家不敢动笔啦。但是事实怎么样呢？完全相反，所有上述的一切现象，都不是在批评发展的情况下产生的，而是在批评极端不发展的情况下产生的。说到批评，我们不能不说到“武训传”的批评。大家知道，对于“武训传”的批评，并不是任何一个文学艺术团体发起的，而是中共中央发起的。文艺界的许多重要人物，如果不是支持了“武训传”的摄制、放映和宣传，也是容许了这些，并且有些人是直到中共中央发起了批评以后，对于这个批评也是抱着消极态度的。在“武训传”的批评以后，文学艺术界的批评是比较活跃了，但是至今除了一些文艺刊物的编辑部以外，也仍然没有一个文学艺术团体，把经常组织批评和自我批评当作自己的任务。这种现象难道是可以忍受的吗？但是为什么这种现象竟可以存在两年之久呢？
    文学艺术界的许多领导工作人员，显然忘记了马克思主义关于文学艺术是社会的一定的经济基础的上层建筑这个基本观点。什么是上层建筑的作用呢？斯大林说：
     “上层建筑是由基础产生的，这并不是说上层建筑只是反映基础，只是消极的，中立的，对自己的基础的命运、对阶级的命运、对制度的性质漠不关心的。相反的，上层建筑一出现后，就要成为极大的积极力量，积极帮助自己的基础的形成和巩固，采取一切办法帮助新制度来根除和消灭旧基础和旧阶级。
    不这样也是不可能的。基础之所以创立自己的上层建筑，也就是为了要使上层建筑替它服务，要使上层建筑积极帮助它形成起来和巩固起来，要使上层建筑积极为消灭已经过时的旧基础及其旧上层建筑而斗争。只要上层建筑拒绝履行它替基础服务的作用，只要上层建筑从积极保卫自己的基础的立场走到对自己的基础漠不关心的立场，走到对各个阶级同等看待的立场，它就会丧失自己的本质，并终止其为上层建筑。”（斯大林：“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”）
    我们的文学艺术事业之没有成为“极大的积极的力量”，没有能够发动广大的文学艺术工作者的奋不顾身的劳动精神和战斗精神，岂不正是因为一些领导人员对于文学艺术采取了非马克思主义的观点吗？在文学艺术领域放弃或放松阶级斗争，不把文学艺术事业了解为阶级斗争的郑重事业，而使它“从积极保卫自己的基础的立场走到对自己的基础漠不关心的立场，走到对各个阶级同等看待的立场”，岂不正是目前文学艺术界的各种危险现象的真正根源吗？
    文学艺术界的许多领导工作人员，也显然忘记了毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的基本指示。和上述斯大林的意见一样，毛泽东同志在这个座谈会上指出：文学艺术的根本任务，就是要“很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”。毛泽东同志指出：为了正确地完成文学艺术的这个任务，文艺工作者就必须站在工人阶级的立场，那些还没有站在工人阶级立场的就必须竭力改造自己，以便“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”。毛泽东同志说：“你要群众了解你，你要与群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。……我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”毛泽东同志在这个座谈会上的结论的末了尖锐地指出了这个思想改造的原则意义：
    “小资产阶级出身的人们总是经过种种方法，也经过文学艺术的方法，顽强地表现他们自己，宣传他们自己的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界。在这种情形下，我们的工作，就是要向他们大喝一声，说：‘同志’们，你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级和人民大众是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国亡头的危险。只能依谁呢？只能依照无产阶级及其先锋队的面貌改造党，改造世界。我们希望文艺界的同志们认识这一场大论战的严重性，积极起来参加这个斗争，向敌人，向朋友，向同志，向自己，使每个同志都健全起来，使我们整个队伍在思想上和组织上都真正统
    一起来，巩固起来。”
    毛泽东同志的指示，在今天难道不是同样地适用吗？在今天的革命文学艺术界，难道不是存在着更大的资产阶级小资产阶级思想的包围吗？今天的中国是人民民主主义的中国，就是说今天的民主主义是工人阶级领导的。但是这并不是说工人阶级的领导可以自然而然地存在着，更不是说资产阶级和小资产阶级能够停止它们的依照自己的面貌改造世界的活动；不，这是不可能的。无论在文艺战线上，或是在其他的思想意识战线上，工人阶级必须在联合资产阶级和小资产阶级的同时，力争自己的领导地位；必须在承认资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想在今天的社会上的合法地位的同时，批评这些思想的错误，指出这些思想之决不能够担当改造世界的领导责任。工人阶级必须坚持依照自己的面貌来改造世界，来改造资产阶级和小资产阶级，而不允许降低自己到资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想水平来为他们“服务”。如果放弃这个思想斗争，就是放弃工人阶级的领导，就是放弃人民民主事业。其结果，不但要脱离工人群众，而且也要脱离工人阶级以外的但是今天已经在工人阶级领导下的广大的人民群众，因为这些群众根据自己的经验和觉悟已经相信，能够真正给他们指点光明前途的，只是革命的工人阶级的思想，而不是资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想。他们和工人群众一样地要求我们的文学艺术引导他们向前看，而不是向后看。
    因此，对于我国人民精神生活发挥着重大的领导作用的文艺工作者，不能不力求站到工人阶级的立场上来，不能不力求和劳动人民建立亲密的联系。只有抱着革命态度到群众中去，和群众打成一片，充分地了解群众的生活、斗争、思想、感情，才能带着创作的要求、想像、主题、题材从群众中来，然后才能写出真实的革命的作品，让作品到群众中去为群众服务。只有这样，我们的文学艺术的创作才会旺盛，才会走上现实主义的大路而摆脱反现实主义的迷途，才会为群众所欢迎，才会掌握群众，成为“极大的积极的力量”。
    由此可见，目前文学艺术工作中的首要问题，从根本上说，就是确立工人阶级的思想领导和帮助广大的非工人阶级文艺工作者进行思想改造的问题。不解决这个问题，其他问题的解决是不可能的。
    那么，什么是目前的文学艺术界的出路呢？
    出路就是，第一，按照毛泽东同志的指示，认真进行思想改造的学习，学习马克思主义，并且与工农兵群众相结合。这次全国文联指定了几种适当的文件，并且规定了学习时采取批评和自我批评的方法，以便于文艺工作者分清是非，确定立场，这是很好的。我们希望这个学习能够认真地进行，作为许多文艺工作者脱离非工人阶级立场而取得工人阶级立场的一个开端。
    第二，充分地宣传马克思主义的文艺思想，批评反马克思主义的文艺思想；使大家彻底认识文学艺术事业是工人阶级阶级斗争事业的一个重要部分，它不可能对于工人阶级和人民群众的事业漠不关心，或者对于各个阶级一视同仁，而必须在工人阶级领导下成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的强大武器；使大家彻底认识文艺工作者必须和劳动人民密切联系，从劳动人民的生活和斗争中找到创作的源泉。
    第三，整顿文学艺术事业的领导。我们的文学艺术事业既然是工人阶级的思想斗争事业，那么它的领导就不能不是思想的领导，不能不是创作和批评的领导。因此，我们就必须反对文艺领导工作中的那种无思想的庸俗的自由主义和事务主义的作风，就必须扩大和加强创作和批评的领导，减少一切可以减少的行政事务，以便于缩小但是也加强文艺行政工作。
    第四，整顿文学艺术团体，使每一个确有存在必要的文学艺术团体都能够成为战斗的组织，都能够切实地帮助文艺工作者和劳动人民结合，组织文艺工作者的创作、批评和学习的活动。不能够这样作的文艺团体应该宣告解散；不能够实际从事文艺劳动的“文艺工作者”应该被所属的文艺团体所开除。
    第五，整顿文学艺术出版物，首先是整顿文学艺术的期刊。全国文联已经作出了整顿文艺期刊的勇敢的决定，希望这个决定能够坚决地迅速地实施，并且希望今后的文艺期刊能够为反对粗制滥造、提高文艺作品的思想性和艺术性而斗争。
    第六，要求共产党员的文艺工作者在所有上述各项活动中成为模范，就是说，成为学习马克思主义的模范，成为与工农兵相结合的模范，成为实行批评和自我批评的模范，和成为文艺劳动的模范，反对党员文艺工作者的任何无纪律现象。
    同志们！只要我们认真地采取这些步骤，我们就一定能够达到目的。让我们团结一致，把中华人民共和国的文学艺术的旗帜更高地举起来吧！
