Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 25th. The group committee for the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 25th made no progress due to the other party's continued insistence on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs. The group committee meeting lasted less than ten minutes before the other party proposed an adjournment. Our representative sternly pointed out that the progress of the meeting depended on the efforts of both parties, and the people of the world hoped that both parties would work hard to reach an agreement before December 27th. The other party's attitude clearly disregarded the world people's ardent desire for peace and deliberately delayed the armistice negotiations.
    At the group committee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative continued to demand that the group committee immediately adopt the principle of promptly releasing all prisoners of war after the armistice. However, the other party still refused to express its attitude towards this absolutely fair and reasonable principle. Instead, they used the excuse that some of our prisoners of war were residents of South Korea before June 25, 1950, and insisted on detaining 16,243 people from the list of prisoners of war to be handed over to us. Our representative vehemently denounced this absurd argument, pointing out that prisoners of war on both sides must be based on the army to which they belong, and it is impossible to forcibly detain them based on their pre-war place of residence. Our representative also pointed out that one of the other party's soldiers who illegally entered the neutral zone and was captured by us was a resident of Pyongyang, but we still released him. Our side cannot tolerate the other party's attempt to detain our prisoners of war under any pretext.

    美方不顾世界人民和平愿望继续拖延谈判
    第三第四两项议程小组会又没有任何进展
    【新华社开城二十五日电】二十五日朝鲜停战谈判的第三项议程的小组委员会，由于对方仍然坚持干涉我内政的无理要求，而毫无进展。小组委员会开会未及十分钟，对方即提出休会的建议。我方代表严词指出：会议的进展有赖于双方的努力，全世界人民希望双方努力在十二月二十七日前达成协议，对方的态度显然是不顾世界人民热烈的和平愿望，有意拖延停战谈判。在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续要求小组委员会立即通过停战后迅速释放全体战俘的原则。但对方却仍然拒绝对于这一绝对公平合理的原则表示态度，反而藉口某些我方战俘在一九五○年六月二十五日以前是南朝鲜居民，坚持扣留交与我方的战俘名单中的一万六千二百四十三人。我方代表痛斥这种荒谬论点，指出双方战俘必须依其所属军队为准，而不可能依其战前居住地为根据而强加扣留。我方代表并指出：前次非法进入中立区为我俘获的对方士兵中就有一人是家住平壤者，我方仍予放还，对方以任何藉口扣留我方战俘的企图都是我方所不能容忍的。
