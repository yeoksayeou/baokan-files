Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th: Luzhou dispatch: November 15th was the Yi people's New Year. The Yi people in the Lesser Liang Mountains in Southern Sichuan joyfully celebrated their second New Year since liberation. State-owned trading companies in the Yi areas have all reduced the prices of New Year goods for the Yi people. The Mabian County People's Government also organized trade purchasing and sales teams, bringing large quantities of homespun cloth, salt, needles, thread, combs, and other goods to the Yi areas for low-price sales. The Yi people did not have to travel long distances but could exchange local products for daily necessities locally.

Before liberation, the Yi people in the Lesser Liang Mountains were deceived by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and large amounts of land were planted with opium, affecting grain production. At the same time, due to the instigation of the reactionary government, the Yi people were not united with each other and often engaged in "feuds," leading to extreme poverty. Many people had never celebrated a happy New Year. After liberation, the People's Government led the Yi people to gradually convert the land that used to grow opium to grain cultivation and helped the Yi people mediate many internal disputes. Now, the lives of the Yi people have gradually improved. This year, many Yi compatriots slaughtered pigs and sheep in their homes to joyfully celebrate the New Year.

    小凉山区彝族人民欢度年节
    国营贸易公司减价供应年货
    【新华社重庆七日电】泸州讯：十一月十五日是彝族人民的年节，川南小凉山区彝族人民在这一天愉快地度过了解放后的第二个新年。彝区的国营贸易公司都减价供应彝民年货。马边县人民政府还组织了贸易购销组，带了大批土布、盐巴、针、线、梳篦等货物到彝区廉价销售；彝族人民不必远道跋涉，就可在当地用土产换到日用必需品。
    解放前，小凉山区彝族人民受了国民党反动政府的欺骗，大量的土地都种植鸦片，影响了粮食生产。同时，由于反动政府的挑拨离间，彝族人民相互之间又不团结，经常“打冤家”，生活极为贫困，许多人从来没有度过一个快活的年节。解放后，人民政府领导彝族人民把过去种鸦片的土地逐步改种了粮食，并帮助彝民调解了许多内部纠纷。现在，彝族人民的生活已逐渐得到改善。今年许多彝胞的家里都杀了猪和羊，欢度年节。
