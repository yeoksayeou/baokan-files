    The 120th issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition has been published.

    This issue publishes an editorial titled "The Unity of the Working Class is a Necessary Condition for Achieving Victory in the Struggle for Peace and the Vital Interests of the Working People," which states: The resolution of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties in November 1949 pointed out that in the history of the international working-class movement, the unity of the working class, both nationally and globally, has never been as decisive as it is now. The unity of the working class is an indispensable condition for defending peace, preventing the establishment of fascist rule, resolutely repelling the attack of monopoly capital on the vital interests of the working class, and striving for the improvement of the economic conditions of the working class. The editorial continues: With the increasing sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism and the entire colonial system, and with the increasing unemployment and poverty of the working masses in capitalist countries, the struggle for the unity of the working class is becoming more and more active and successful. The editorial describes the increasing strength of international democratic trade unions, women's and youth organizations, the support of millions of people for the resolutions of the World Peace Council, the historical achievements of the people's democratic countries in uniting the working class, and lists the recent achievements of the working people in France, Italy, and Australia. The editorial points out that the individual party organizations of the Communist and Workers' Parties in capitalist countries still have shortcomings in carrying out the task of expanding and consolidating the united front of national democratic forces. Some communists overestimate the strength of the enemy and underestimate the strength of the working class. Some party propagandists sometimes lack patience and are unwilling to deal with ordinary socialist workers who have been deceived by imperialists, to truly awaken them. The editorial emphasizes that it is the responsibility of every communist and party activist to wage a selfless and persistent struggle to win the unity of the workers. The editorial also quotes the resolution of the Information Bureau meeting in November 1949, stating: The unity of the workers' movement and the strengthening of all democratic forces are not only necessary for solving the daily problems of the working class and the working people but also for solving the fundamental problems faced by the proletariat (as a class leading the struggle to overthrow the power of monopoly capital and transform society according to socialist principles).

    This issue publishes the new program of the Japanese Communist Party, "The Current Demands of the Japanese Communist Party." The program analyzes how the American occupation has caused suffering to the Japanese people, that the Yoshida government is the spiritual and political pillar of the American occupation system, and points out that the national liberation democratic revolution in Japan is inevitable. The program lists the Japanese Communist Party's thirty-two demands regarding foreign policy, national system, peasant issues, and worker issues, pointing out that the implementation of these demands will liberate the Japanese people from enslavement and poverty. The program concludes by calling on all progressive forces in Japan, especially workers and peasants, to immediately strengthen and develop the national liberation democratic united front.

    This issue publishes Fiereika's essay, "The Growth of Czechoslovakia's National Income is a Symbol of Economic Prosperity," which describes that in 1951, Czech national income (i.e., the total value of production of the country's entire economy in a given year) was 38.2 percent higher than in 1937. However, the Czech population decreased after the war, so the most reflective material of economic achievements is the increase in national income calculated per capita, which shows that 1951 was 68 percent higher than 1937. In 1949, Czech national income increased by 12.5 percent compared to pre-war levels, 7.2 percent in 1950, and 14.5 percent in 1951; while the U.S. national economic income increased by only 0.5 to 1.5 percent annually. Fiereika said: The rapid rise in national income is directly related to the growth of industry. In 1937, the contribution of Czech industry to national income was 53.2 percent, which increased to 61.9 percent in 1948. The growth of national income guarantees an increase in the people's consumption power. In 1950, compared to 1936, the people's consumption of meat and meat products increased by 45.7 percent, and wheat flour and grains increased by 54.4 percent. This year, the proportion of industrial wages in national income reached 45.5 percent.

    This issue publishes an essay by the Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Morinoh, titled: "The Will of the French Working People to Unite and Struggle," which discusses the current situation of the French workers' united struggle. This issue also publishes an article by Shehu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party: "The Tito-Rankovic Fascist Clique's Criminal Conspiracy Against the Albanian People," which details the Tito gang's massacre of Albanians in Yugoslavia and the dispatch of spies into Albania, as well as provocations on the border.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二○期介绍 “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二○期已经出版。
    本期发表以“工人阶级的团结是争取和平与劳动人民切身利益的斗争取得胜利的必要条件”为题的社论说：一九四九年十一月共产党与工人党情报局会议的决议曾指出：在国际工人阶级运动的历史上，工人阶级在一国范围以及在世界范围内的团结，从来没有像现在这样具有决定性的重要意义。工人阶级的团结，对于保卫和平、防止法西斯统治的建立、坚决打退独占资本向工人阶级切身利益的进攻和争取工人阶级经济状况的改善是必不可少的条件。社论接着说：随着资本主义和整个殖民制度的总危机的日益尖锐化，随着资本主义国家劳动群众的失业和贫困日益加剧，争取工人阶级团结的斗争是越来越活跃，越来越有成绩了。社论叙述了国际的民主工会及妇女和青年组织的力量日益增加，千百万人民都支持世界和平理事会的决议，人民民主国家在使工人阶级团结起来的方面已获得了历史性的成就，并且列举了法国、意大利、澳大利亚的劳动人民最近斗争的成绩。社论指出：资本主义国家的共产党与工人党的个别的党组织，在执行扩大并巩固全国民主力量的统一阵线的任务时还存有缺点。有一些共产党员过高估计了敌人的力量，过低估计了工人阶级的力量。还有些党的宣传员有时缺乏耐心，不愿和那些受了帝国主义者欺骗的普通社会党员工人打交道，使他们真正醒悟过来。社论强调说：每一个共产党员和党的积极分子的责任，是进行忘我的坚持的斗争以争取工人的团结。社论并摘引一九四九年十一月情报局会议的决议说：工人运动的团结和一切民主力量的加强，非但对于解决工人阶级和劳动人民的日常问题是必要的，就是对于解决无产阶级（作为一个领导着推翻独占资本的政权、按照社会主义方针改造社会的斗争的阶级）所面临的基本问题也是必要的。
    本期刊载了日本共产党的新纲领“日本共产党的当前要求”。纲领中分析了美国的占领怎样使日本人民遭受痛苦，吉田政府是美国占领制度的精神的政治的支柱，并指出日本的民族解放民主革命不可避免。纲领中举出了日本共产党关于对外政策、国家制度、农民问题、工人问题的三十二项要求，指出实行这些要求会把日本国民从奴役和贫困下解放出来。纲领最后号召日本一切进步势力首先是工人、农民立即加强和发展民族解放民主统一战线。
    本期刊载了费列依卡的论文“捷克斯洛伐克国民收入的增长是经济繁荣的象征”，文中叙述一九五一年捷克国民收入（即某一年度国家的整个经济的生产总值）比一九三七年高出百分之三十八点二。但在战后捷克人口减少了，所以最能反映经济成就的材料是以人口平均计算国民收入的增加，这一数字显示一九五一年比一九三七年高过了百分之六十八。在一九四九年，捷克国民收入比战前上升了百分之十二点五，一九五○年上升了百分之七点二，一九五一年上升了百分之十四点五；而美国国民经济收入每年增加不过百分之零点五到一点五。费列依卡说：国民收入的迅速上升是与工业的增长有直接关系的。一九三七年捷克工业对国民收入的贡献是百分之五十三点二，一九四八年就增长为百分之六十一点九。国民收入的增长保证了人民消费力的增加，一九五○年和一九三六年相比，人民对肉及肉制品的消费提高了百分之四十五点七，麦粉和五谷提高了百分之五十四点四。今年工业工资在国民收入中所占的比重达到了百分之四十五点五。
