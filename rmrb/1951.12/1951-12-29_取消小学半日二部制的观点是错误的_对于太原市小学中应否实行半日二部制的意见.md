    The View of Abolishing the Half-Day, Two-Shift System in Primary Schools is Wrong
    – Opinions on Whether to Implement the Half-Day, Two-Shift System in Primary Schools in Taiyuan City
     Shi Jiyan
    Approximately fifty percent of school-age children in Taiyuan City, or more than 36,000 children, are still out of school, with a large proportion of them being children of workers. How should we address the issue of these children out of school? Among education workers in Taiyuan City, there are two attitudes: one advocates for the implementation of a half-day, two-shift system in the lower grades of primary school, where each class attends school for half a day, and the original teachers and classrooms can accommodate twice the number of students, enabling a rapid and large-scale enrollment of out-of-school children in the present. The other attitude does not support the half-day, two-shift system, arguing that it has significant drawbacks and many difficulties in implementation, and that the existing problem of out-of-school children can be resolved when a large number of new, regular schools are built in the future. The struggle between these two opinions is centrally reflected in the evolutionary process of implementing the half-day, two-shift system in several primary schools in Taiyuan City.
    Taiyuan is a newly emerging industrial city. With the increase in the industrial population and the improvement of the living standards of the working people, the demands of the broad masses to send their children to school are becoming increasingly urgent. However, the existing primary schools are already unable to accommodate them. Under these circumstances, some primary schools in Taiyuan City began implementing the half-day, two-shift system in the first and second grades of primary school last year. By the first half of this year, the half-day, two-shift system had developed to 96 classes, with approximately 5,390 students, solving the enrollment problem for a considerable number of out-of-school children. Taiyuan City currently has 258 primary schools, with a total of 412 full-day first-grade classes (approximately 50 students per class). If these classes are all converted to a half-day, two-shift system, it can absorb approximately 20,600 more students than at present, thereby increasing the proportion of enrolled school-age children and the proportion of school-age children in the city from 50 percent to over 78 percent. If the half-day, two-shift system is promoted in all first-grade classes in the 20,300-plus primary schools in Shanxi Province, the number of first-grade pupils in Shanxi Province can be increased from the current 560,000-plus to 1.12 million, and 90 percent of the 610,000-plus school-age children currently out of school in Shanxi Province will therefore have the opportunity to enroll. If the half-day, two-shift system is promoted nationwide, its impact will be even greater. Currently, there are over 440,000 primary schools nationwide. Counting one first-grade class per school and 50 students per class, if all first-grade classes in primary schools nationwide are converted to a half-day, two-shift system, approximately 22 million more students can be added, which is equivalent to more than 50 percent of the nearly 40 million school-age children out of school nationwide.
    However, this revolutionary method of the half-day, two-shift system has not continued to be fully implemented in Taiyuan City. By the second half of this year, only two classes remained in the No. 12 Complete Primary School. Why do some education workers not support the half-day, two-shift system? They have the following untenable "reasons." Some people say, "Parents do not welcome the half-day, two-shift system." This is not in accordance with the facts. We once visited three parents, including Wang Shuyuan, the mother of Zhang Zhiquan, a half-day, two-shift system student residing at No. 1, Yong'an Road, Taiyuan City, and their unanimous conclusion was: "It is much better for the children to be in school than at home." This shows that if the half-day, two-shift system is compared with being out of school, parents still welcome the half-day, two-shift system. Of course, when comparing the "half-day system" with the "full-day system," parents prefer the full-day system. Some people also say, "Teachers oppose the half-day, two-shift system" because one teacher is in charge of two classes and cannot manage. It is true that two-shift teachers are more hardworking, and this should and can be adjusted and resolved. However, not all teachers think they cannot manage. In fact, among the teachers we have come into contact with, many firmly support the half-day, two-shift system. Those whose thinking is temporarily unclear can also be persuaded. Their third reason is that "the housing problem cannot be solved." Under the condition that one teacher is responsible for two half-day, two-shift classes (a total of 100 students), it is more difficult to implement the half-day, two-shift system in the second and third grades. Therefore, if classes are promoted to full-day classes in the future, more classrooms will be needed. This is indeed a difficulty, but it can be overcome. According to the standards of the No. 12 Complete Primary School, a classroom that is two zhang long and one zhang two chi wide can accommodate two half-day, two-shift classes. Although there are currently few houses and they cannot be built in large numbers, if we rigorously practice frugality in the school and are good at relying on the masses to find some small houses, it is not fundamentally impossible. Moreover, promotion is a matter of a year later, so there is plenty of time to solve this problem, not to mention the favorable conditions of the national economic situation and the people's lives improving day by day. Fourth, they say, "If the half-day, two-shift system is implemented, it will inevitably destroy the five-year consistent system." Indeed, if the half-day, two-shift system is implemented, it may take an extra year or so to complete the primary school curriculum. However, this extension should be allowed because it meets the requirements of the broad masses of the people and also meets the Central Ministry of Education's policy of popularizing children's elementary education in a planned and step-by-step manner with revolutionary methods. The decision of the First National Elementary Education and Teacher Training Education Conference requires all primary schools to gradually implement the five-year consistent system within five years, rather than requiring a neat and uniform start to the five-year consistent system immediately this year or next year. Therefore, the current implementation of the half-day, two-shift system and the provisions for the implementation of the five-year consistent system are not mutually exclusive.
    Therefore, there is no valid reason to abolish the half-day, two-shift system. Especially in cities like Taiyuan, where there are many out-of-school children of workers, it is even more inappropriate to abolish the half-day, two-shift system. We believe that the idea of advocating the abolition of the half-day, two-shift system and waiting to solve the problem of children out of school by increasing the number of new primary schools should be corrected.

    取消小学半日二部制的观点是错误的
    ——对于太原市小学中应否实行半日二部制的意见
     史纪言
    太原市还有大约百分之五十的学龄儿童，即三万六千余人失学，其中很大部分是工人子女。怎样对待这些失学儿童？在太原市教育工作者中，有两种态度：一种是主张在小学低年级推行半日二部制，即每班上半日课，原来的教员和教室，就可容纳一倍的学生，使失学儿童在目前就能够迅速地大量地入学。另一种则不赞成半日二部制，认为半日二部制有很大缺点，实行起来，困难很多，现有的失学儿童问题可以等将来增建大批新的正规的学校时来解决。这两种意见的斗争，集中地反映在太原市若干小学实行半日二部制的演变过程上。
    太原是新兴的工业城市，随着工业人口的增加和劳动人民生活的改善，广大人民对于送儿童入学的要求日益迫切。但是，现有小学已经容纳不下。在这种情况下，太原市的一部分小学从去年开始在小学一、二年级实行了半日二部制。到今年上半年，半日二部制曾发展到九十六个班，约五千三百九十名学生，解决了相当大的一部分失学儿童的入学问题。太原市现有小学二百五十八所，共有全日制的一年级班四百一十二个（每班约五十人），如果将这些班一律改为半日二部制，则可比现在多吸收约二万零六百名学生，从而使太原的入学学龄儿童和全市学龄儿童的比例由百分之五十提高到百分之七十八以上。如果把半日二部制在山西省的二万零三百余所小学所有一年级班次中加以推广，则可以使山西省的一年级小学生由现在的五十六万余人增加为一百一十二万人，山西省现在失学的六十一万余学龄儿童将因此有百分之九十得到入学机会。如果把半日二部制推广到全国，它的作用就更大了。现全国有小学四十四万余所，以每所一个一年级班，每班五十名学生计，全国的小学一年级全部改为半日二部制后，大约可增加学生二千二百余万名，这等于全国近四千万失学的学龄儿童的百分之五十多。
    但是，半日二部制这个革命办法，在太原市却没有继续充分地实行起来。到今年下半年仅剩第十二完全小学的两个班了。为什么有些教育工作者不赞成半日二部制呢？他们有下述一些站不住脚的“理由”。有些人说：“家长不欢迎半日二部制”。这是不合乎事实的。我们曾经访问了住在太原市永安路一号的半日二部制学生张志全的母亲王淑媛等三位家长，她们的一致结论是：“孩子上了学，比在家里时好得多了。”这说明：如果把半日二部制和失学加以比较，家长还是欢迎半日二部制的。当然，用“半日制”和“全日制”比较，家长们是愿意全日制的。有些人又说：“教员反对半日二部制。”因为一个教员管两个班，忙不过来。二部制教员比较辛苦是真实的，是应该也是可能设法加以调整解决的。但是，教员们并不都是认为忙不过来的。事实上，在和我们接触的教员中，有不少是坚决赞成半日二部制的。那些思想暂时不通的人，也是可以说服的。他们的第三个理由，是“房子问题解决不了”。在一个教员负责两个半日二部制班（共一百学生）的条件下，二、三年级较难实行半日二部制，因此，如果将来升全日制的班次时，要增加教室。这确是一个困难，但是可以克服的。按照第十二完全小学的标准，有一个长二丈、宽一丈二市尺的教室，就可以办两个半日二部制班。虽然目前房子少，又不能大批增建，但如果在校内厉行房屋节约，并善于依靠群众，设法调剂一些小房子，不是根本办不到的，而且升班是一年以后的事，可以有充分的时间来解决这个问题，何况又有国家经济情况和人民生活日益改善这个有利条件呢？第四，他们说：“如果实行半日二部制，必将破坏五年一贯制。”的确，实行半日二部制，小学课程可能要延长一年半载才能读完。但是，这样延长是应该允许的，因为合乎广大人民的要求，也合乎中央教育部用革命办法有计划有步骤地普及儿童初等教育的方针。第一次全国初等教育和师范教育会议的决定，是要求各小学在五年内逐步实行五年一贯制，而不是要求在今、明年马上整整齐齐地开始五年一贯制。因此，目前实行半日二部制和实行五年一贯制的规定是并行不悖的。
    所以，取消半日二部制是没有正确理由的。特别在太原这样失学工人子女很多的城市，取消半日二部制更为不妥。我们以为主张取消半日二部制而以等待增办新小学来解决儿童失学问题的思想，应该改正过来。
