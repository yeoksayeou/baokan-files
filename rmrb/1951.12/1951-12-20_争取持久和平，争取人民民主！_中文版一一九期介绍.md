The Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 119 has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Forces of Peace Will Surely Defeat the Forces of War," stating that the great ideal of defending peace has enthusiastic supporters in every country. The Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council further powerfully demonstrates that the organized international peace front is growing stronger day by day, and it is now a powerful force capable of stopping the evil hands of the American and British warmongers. The editorial points out that the strong pillar of the people's movement to defend peace in all countries is the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union consistently exposes the conspiracies of imperialism and always opposes war and strives for peace and friendly relations between countries with its actions. The People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia, and the German Democratic Republic all stand with the Soviet Union. At the same time, the struggle of the people in colonies and dependencies for freedom and national independence poses an increasing threat to imperialism. However, the policy pursued by the United States is completely contrary to the above policies. The bloody American intervention in Korea continues, and it is doing its best to delay and undermine the armistice negotiations. While accelerating war preparations, the American and British aggressive blocs cannot but take into account the powerful movement of the people of all countries against war, and therefore continue to talk emptily about their so-called desire for peace, attempting to trap the people of all countries in a web of lies. The so-called plan to limit and reduce armaments recently proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson at the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France is a typical example. The editorial concludes by saying that the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council are of great significance for further developing the struggle for peace. These resolutions are supported by the majority of the world's people. There is no doubt that these resolutions will become a concrete action program for millions of peace fighters. The words of the great Stalin encourage them: "If the people of all countries take up the cause of safeguarding peace and persevere in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."

This issue publishes an article by Koplenig (formerly translated as Ke Lunni), Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party, entitled "The Political Situation in Austria and the Tasks of the Communist Party." Koplenig pointed out that the reactionary Austrian government, under the orders of American war makers, is sacrificing national sovereignty and national independence, rapidly turning western Austria into a war base and bridgehead for Western aggressors. As a result of accepting the enslaving Marshall Plan and pursuing a policy of preparing for war, the people's living standards have been lowered, the Austrian economy is completely dependent on the United States, production is seriously declining, and unemployment is increasing day by day. In order to find a way out of this intolerable situation, all defenders of peace and democracy must unite and carry out a common struggle for peace, national independence, and decent living conditions. The Communist Party strives to unite all those who are concerned about the survival of the nation, to unite all progressive organizations, groups, and movements, and to form a broad front to fight for peace and the freedom of the Austrian people. Koplenig then pointed out that in order to accomplish these great tasks, the Communist Party must do everything possible to achieve the unity of the working class. And one of the most important conditions for achieving this unity is to overcome the obvious sectarianism that still exists in the party ranks in relation to the Social Democratic workers. At the same time, Communists must earnestly strive to win the broad masses of the people in the countryside away from the influence of reactionary parties and attract them to fight alongside the working class. The party must be strengthened politically, ideologically, and organizationally.

This issue publishes an article by Flais, a member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, entitled "Strengthening the System of One-Man Management in Hungarian Industry." Flais pointed out that in the early stage of post-war economic development, Hungarian enterprises were managed by the secretary of the Party organization, the secretary of the trade union committee, and the factory director. However, the Hungarian national economy increasingly urgently needs to implement the system of one-man management, so that this system can realize the principles of socialist industrial organization in its development process. Flais went on to say that as a leader, one must master production technology and become an expert in production positions. In Hungary, many party members are striving to master technology, familiarize themselves with economic and financial issues, and learn industrial management. The training of these cadres has been organized on a large scale. Enterprise managers should remember Comrade Stalin's words about the personal responsibility of enterprise managers for the work entrusted to them by the people. Stalin said: "We must no longer tolerate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for production work. To get rid of this scourge, we must organize labor in a new way, properly arrange forces, so that every worker is responsible for the work, the machine, and the quality of the work." We must accept and implement the Soviet system of one-man management and the principle of personal responsibility of leaders. It is necessary to ensure that each leader has as much independence as possible so that he can implement some important and correct measures in the enterprise.

This issue also publishes articles such as "The British Election and the New Conservative Government" by Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the British Communist Party. This issue publishes the message to the United Nations and the people of all countries of the world adopted by the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council and news about other resolutions.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一一九期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一一九期已经出版。
    本期发表题为“和平的力量一定战胜战争的力量”的社论说：保卫和平这一伟大的理想在每一个国家都有热烈的拥护者。世界和平理事会维也纳会议进一步有力地证明了有组织的国际和平阵线在一天天地成长壮大，它现在已经是能够制止美英战争贩子的魔手的强大力量了。社论指出：各国人民保卫和平运动的坚强支柱是伟大的社会主义国家苏联。苏联，一贯地揭穿帝国主义的阴谋，始终用行动来反对战争，争取和平和各国间的友好关系。中华人民共和国、欧亚两洲的人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国，都和苏联站在一起。同时，殖民地和附属国人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争对帝国主义的威胁是越来越大了。但是，美国所奉行的政策却和上述政策完全相反。美国对朝鲜的血腥干涉还在继续进行，它正在竭力拖延和破坏停战谈判。美英侵略集团一方面在加速准备战争，但另一方面也不能不估计到各国人民反对战争的强大运动，因此继续空谈他们的所谓和平意愿，企图使各国人民陷入谎言的罗网。美国国务卿艾奇逊最近在联合国大会第六届会议上代表美、英、法三国政府所提出的所谓限制和裁减军备的方案，就是一个典型的例子。社论最后说：世界和平理事会第二次会议的决议，对于进一步发展争取和平的斗争具有极重大的意义。这些决议是得到世界大多数人民的支持的。毫无疑问，这些决议将成为千百万和平战士的具体行动纲领。伟大斯大林的话鼓舞着他们：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    本期发表了奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希（前译柯伦尼）的“奥地利的政治形势与共产党的任务”一文。柯普勒尼希指出：奥地利反动政府在美国战争制造者的命令下，正在断送国家主权和民族独立，迅速地把奥地利西部变成西方侵略者的战争基地和桥头堡垒。由于接受奴役性的马歇尔计划和推行准备战争的政策，人民生活水准降低了，奥地利经济完全依赖美国，生产有严重减少之势，失业人数日益增加。为了在这种不能忍受的局势中找到一条出路，所有和平与民主的保卫者必须团结起来为和平、民族独立和适当的生活条件进行共同的斗争。共产党力求团结所有那些担心国家生存问题的人们，团结所有的进步组织、团体和运动，结成一个广泛的阵线，以争取和平和奥地利人民的自由。柯普勒尼希接着指出：为了完成这些伟大的任务，共产党必须尽一切努力来实现工人阶级的团结。而实现这种团结的最重要条件之一，就是克服党队伍中在对社会党工人的关系上仍然存在的明显的宗派主义。同时，共产党人必须认真争取乡村广大阶层的人民脱离反动政党的影响，并吸引他们和工人阶级共同进行斗争。党必须在政治上、思想上和组织上加强起来。
    本期刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员弗利斯的“加强匈牙利工业中的一人管理制”一文。弗利斯指出：在战后经济发展的初期，匈牙利企业曾由党组织的书记、工会委员会书记和厂长三方面负责管理。但是，匈牙利国民经济愈来愈迫切地需要实行一人管理制，使这个制度在它的发展过程中实现社会主义工业组织的原则。弗利斯接着说：作为一个领袖，就必须掌握生产技术，成为生产岗位上的专家。在匈牙利，许多党员正力求精通技术、熟悉经济和财政问题，学习工业管理。这些干部的训练工作已经大规模地组织起来了。企业管理人应当记住斯大林同志关于企业管理人个人应对人民付托给他们的工作负责的话。斯大林说：“我们必须不可再容忍生产工作中无人负责的现象。要免除这个祸害，就必须按新的方式来组织劳动，适当地布置力量，使每一部分工人都对工作、对机器以及工作质量负责。”我们必须接受并实行苏联的一人管理制和领导人个人负责的原则。必须保证每个领导人有尽可能多的独立，使他能够在企业中实行一些重要而正确的措施。
    本期还刊载了英国共产党副主席杜德的“英国选举和保守党新政府”等文章。本期发表了世界和平理事会维也纳会议所通过的告联合国与世界各国人民书和关于其他各项决议的消息。    　（新华社）
