    Scientific Workers Must Serve the Motherland and the People
    The construction of our great motherland urgently needs science and technology, and scientific workers who love the motherland and are loyal to serving the people. Our Chinese People's Volunteers have demonstrated unparalleled heroism in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country. Our workers and peasants are vigorously displaying their wisdom in the surging patriotic production increase and thrift movement, creating enormous wealth for the motherland. Our scientific workers need to learn from their patriotic spirit, integrate their work, thoughts, and feelings with them, and firmly establish their position of serving the people. Some of our scientific workers have done this; but some have not.
    Some scientific workers one-sidedly emphasize that natural science has no class character, believing that scientific workers are also above class and above politics. This is a very wrong point of view. It is true that natural science has no class character, but natural scientists cannot be without class character, because as a member of society, they cannot transcend society's political and economic life. They cannot but have a certain class standpoint, a certain worldview and outlook on life. They either belong to this class or to that class; they either face the people or turn their backs on the people. They cannot transcend the laws of society simply because they are engaged in the study of natural science. Those who consider themselves above class and above politics are in fact standing on the position of the decadent liberal bourgeoisie. This position makes them unable to distinguish between friend and foe, unable to distinguish right from wrong, and thinking they are objective, but in reality, they blindly worship reactionary Western culture. When the people of the whole country are carrying out the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they even consider it an honor to publish their papers in enemy magazines; when they lecture, they intentionally or unintentionally lead students to worship the enemy; they promote American technology and American scientific standards, while holding a contemptuous attitude towards the wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working people, and are unwilling to humbly learn from the advanced scientific achievements of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. It should be pointed out that this is the result of the long-term education of the European and American bourgeoisie, and also the result of long-term cultural aggression against China by imperialism. If these erroneous ideas are not thoroughly eliminated, Chinese scientific workers will not be able to develop and absorb the creative spirit of our great nation, will not be able to establish China's own scientific tradition, and even less will they be able to make scientific research serve the motherland and the people.
    Another manifestation of the "above class" and "above politics" thinking of scientific workers is the purely technical viewpoint and the viewpoint of personal fame and gain. The so-called "revolutionary division of labor theory" put forward by some people, that is, the saying "you engage in politics, I engage in science," is a concrete manifestation of this kind of thinking. In this way, they do not ask about politics, do not care about the needs of national construction and people's lives, engage in science for the sake of science, and conduct research based solely on personal interests and preferences. The fact is very clear: scientific workers must accept the ideological leadership of the working class and study science with the correct Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. The so-called detachment from politics and lack of concern for politics means detachment from and lack of concern for the interests of the broad masses of the people of the motherland. Only science that serves the people can truly be welcomed by the people. There is no way out for studying science only for personal gain.
    The scientific work of our New China must be closely linked with the construction of the motherland and the needs of the people's lives. Our scientific workers must engage in research work under the leadership and unified planning of the state. Our scientific workers must combine with the rich wisdom and creativity of the workers and peasants of the motherland, learn from the experience of advanced Soviet science, and absorb the scientific experience of bourgeois countries with a critical and principled approach. In our motherland with a long cultural history and rich natural treasures, we will create the science of our great nation.

### 科学工作者必须为祖国为人民服务

    科学工作者必须为祖国为人民服务
    我们伟大祖国的建设事业迫切需要科学和技术，需要热爱祖国、忠心为人民服务的科学工作者。我国人民志愿军在抗美援朝保家卫国的战争中，表现了无比的英雄气概。我国工人和农民正在澎湃的爱国增产节约运动中，高度发挥他们的智慧，为祖国创造巨大的财富。我们的科学工作者，需要学习他们的爱国精神，使自己的工作、思想和感情和他们结合起来，使自己站稳为人民服务的立场。我们有些科学工作者是这样作了；但有些人，还没有这样做。
    某些科学工作者片面强调了自然科学没有阶级性，以为科学工作者也是超越阶级超越政治的，这是非常错误的观点。诚然，自然科学是没有阶级性的，但自然科学工作者却不可能是没有阶级性的，因为他既是社会的一分子，他本身就不能超越社会的政治经济生活，他就不能不有一定阶级的立场，有一定的世界观和人生观。他不是属于这一阶级，便是属于那一阶级，他不是面向人民，便是背向人民，决不能因为他是研究自然科学的，就可以超越于社会的规律。那些自以为超阶级超政治的人其实恰恰是站在腐朽的自由资产阶级的立场。这样的立场，使他敌我不分，是非莫辨，自以为客观，而实际上却是对欧美反动文化的盲目崇拜。当全国人民在进行抗美援朝伟大斗争的时候，他们却甚至以为能在敌人的杂志上发表自己的论文为荣；他们在讲课的时候，有意或无意地让学生跟着自己去崇拜敌人；他们宣传美国的技术和美国的科学水准，而对中国劳动人民的智慧和创造抱着瞧不起的态度，对于伟大的社会主义国家苏联的先进科学的成就不愿虚心学习。应该指出，这是欧美资产阶级长期教育的结果，也是帝国主义对中国长期进行文化侵略的结果。如果不把这些错误思想彻底肃清，中国科学工作者就不能发扬和吸收我们伟大民族的创造精神，不能建立中国自己的科学传统，更不能把科学的研究为祖国为人民服务。
    科学工作者“超阶级”、“超政治”思想的另一种表现，就是单纯技术观点和个人名利观点。有人提出的所谓“革命分工论”，即“你们搞政治，我来搞科学”的说法，就是这种思想的具体的表现。这样他们就不问政治，不管国家建设和人民生活的需要，为科学而科学，单凭个人的兴趣和喜好进行研究。事实很清楚：科学工作者必需接受工人阶级的思想领导，用正确的马列主义的观点来研究科学。所谓脱离政治和不关心政治，就是脱离和不关心祖国广大人民的利益。只有为人民服务的科学，才能真正受到人民的欢迎。只为个人利益而研究科学，是没有出路的。
    我们新中国的科学工作必须和祖国的建设事业，和人民生活的需要血肉相连。我们的科学工作者必须在国家的领导和统一计划之下从事研究工作。我们的科学工作者必须和祖国工人、农民的丰富智慧和创造力结合起来，学习苏联先进科学的经验，有立场地、批判地吸收资产阶级国家的科学经验，在我们具有悠久文化历史和丰富的自然宝藏的祖国，创造我们伟大民族的科学。
