    Korean Central News Agency special correspondent:
    Denounces U.S. for delaying negotiation tactics
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st] A special correspondent for the Korean Central News Agency reported from Kaesong that the Korean armistice negotiations, which are being watched by peace-loving people all over the world, have once again reached a deadlock due to the lack of sincerity and deliberate delays on the part of the U.S. side. The negotiation situation in recent days has once again clearly shown that our side's purpose is to open up all the difficulties hindering the rapid progress of the negotiations with sincere efforts, while the other side is constantly creating various new obstacles, stubbornly adhering to its unilateral and unreasonable demands, and deliberately delaying the negotiations.
    The reporter commented on the discussion of the fourth agenda item, stating: On the 18th, our side handed over all the information about the prisoners of war to the other side, but the list handed over by the other side was extremely unspecific. When our representative pointed out that its material was incorrect, the U.S. side hastily declared that it would submit a revised list of prisoners of war on the 25th, and proposed an adjournment despite the fact that the lists of prisoners of war on both sides had already been exchanged. Is this not enough to show that the other side is insincere? The reporter continued: In the discussion of the third agenda item, the other side still demanded unlimited rotation and replenishment of its military forces, and insisted on the absurd proposal of restricting our side from building necessary facilities. This shows that the U.S. side has not abandoned its sinister ambition to invade Korea and attempts to continue to strengthen its military forces after the armistice is implemented.
    The reporter concluded: The Korean people will absolutely not accept such unreasonable demands from the U.S. side. If the U.S. side has the sincerity to promote the progress of the negotiations, then it must withdraw its unreasonable demands. Only in this way can it live up to the expectations of American soldiers and peace-loving people all over the world.

    斥美方拖延谈判诡计
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜中央通讯社特派记者自开城报道称：在全世界爱好和平人民注视下进行着的朝鲜停战谈判，由于美方缺乏诚意和故意拖延而又陷入了僵局。最近几天的谈判情况，再一次清楚地表明我方的目的是以真挚的努力打开阻碍谈判迅速进展的一切难关，而对方却不断地制造着各种新的障碍，固执其片面的无理要求。故意拖延谈判。
    该记者评论关于第四项议程的讨论称：十八日我方已将有关俘虏的全部资料交给对方，但对方交出的名单却是极不具体的。当我方代表指出它的材料不正确时，美方就慌忙声明要到二十五日再提出整理好的俘虏名单。并不顾双方的俘虏名单业已交换，而提议休会。这难道还不足以说明对方没有诚意吗？该记者继续写道：在第三项议程的讨论中，对方仍要求无限制地轮换与补充其军事力量，并坚持限制我方修建必要设施的荒谬主张。这说明美方还没有放弃其侵略朝鲜的凶恶野心。企图在停战实施后仍继续增强其军事力量。
    该记者最后写道：朝鲜人民是绝对不会接受美方这种无理要求的。如果美方有促使谈判进展的诚意的话，那么就必须收回其无理的要求，只有这样，才能不辜负美国士兵的渴望和全世界爱好和平人民的期待。
