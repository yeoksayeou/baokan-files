    The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a mobilization meeting for rectification study in the North China literary and art circles on December 20th. Attending were cadres from the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the North China Military Region, the North China Affairs Department, other organs and organizations at the North China level, as well as leading literary and art cadres and literary and art workers from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Chahar, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, totaling about 200 people. At the meeting, Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, spoke first. He clearly pointed out the significance and purpose of carrying out the rectification study movement in the entire region's literary and art circles. After explaining the great significance of previous rectification movements, he emphatically pointed out that in order to prepare for China's large-scale construction and to welcome the brilliant and splendid future of national industrialization, the entire country is carrying out the serious struggle of increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy, as well as the ideological reform work and the rectification study movement in the literary and art circles. He pointed out that these extremely important political tasks are all aimed at removing obstacles on our path forward and eliminating the corrosive effects of bourgeois ideology, so as to prepare for the country's large-scale construction.
    The meeting was followed by a report by Zhang Panshi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. After introducing the situation and experience of the rectification study in Beijing's literary and art circles, Zhang Panshi emphatically pointed out that the problems raised in the rectification study in Beijing's literary and art circles also exist in the North China region. In the leadership aspect of literary and art work in the North China region, there is also a tendency to neglect ideology, deviate from politics, deviate from the masses, and deviate from the leadership of the working class ideology. Some Party literary and art cadres are also developing certain phenomena of being unorganized and undisciplined. At present, the whole country is vigorously carrying out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and at the same time launching a rectification study movement in the literary and art circles, launching serious criticism and self-criticism, overcoming erroneous ideas, promoting correct ideas, and rectifying the literary and art ranks. This is of great significance.
    Zhang Panshi pointed out that the literary and art work in the North China region has achieved results in the past two years. However, these achievements are still extremely disproportionate to the various achievements of our country. There are still the following incorrect tendencies in literary and art work, hindering our progress. The first is the issue of the united front in literature and art. After entering the cities, because the ideology of some literary and art workers who came from the liberated areas was not thoroughly reformed, they began to hold complacent emotions and exclude literary and art workers in the new areas. After the Party pointed out this mistake, they also did a lot of work to unite and transform them. However, when bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literary and art workers flattered them, they abandoned the work of transformation, accommodated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literary and art ideas, and abandoned the ideological leadership of the working class. The second is that the leadership work in literature and art is mostly about leading administrative affairs, neglecting ideological leadership. Instead of focusing on studying issues related to literary and artistic creation and criticism, they focus on expanding staffing, housing, and living standards, so that the work of literary and art organizations lacks combativeness and practical content. Third, in literary and artistic creation, there was a serious tendency of disregarding politics. Works reflecting industrial and agricultural production often do not relate to the interests of the country. Some works put on the outer garment of the laboring people, but in reality, they express the vulgar thoughts and feelings of the petty bourgeoisie. Because writers are divorced from reality and politics, there is a common problem of being old-fashioned in creation. In the two years since entering the city, very few works with high ideological and artistic quality that reflect the lives and struggles of workers have been seen. The laboring people demand cultural and artistic life, but writers cannot meet their demands in their creations. Some writers are unwilling to participate in actual struggles, shut themselves up in piles of ancient books, and specialize in writing historical subjects, but they lack a Marxist historical viewpoint, and what they write is often anti-historical. Fourth is serious formalism, not considering the local situation, not studying how to improve ideological content, and single-mindedly imitating big cities, especially learning extravagant and gorgeous forms. Since entering the city, some cultural work troupes have basically not regarded workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main objects of service, but have wholeheartedly yearned for Western technology and despised national and folk art. Fifth is the serious phenomenon of shoddy work and creation slowdown, coexisting at the same time. On the one hand, there is shoddy work, indiscriminately publishing periodicals; on the other hand, some people are nominally writers, but in reality, they are idle and have not written anything for a long time. Sixth, there is a lack of organization and discipline and serious liberalism. The works of some Party literary and art writers are published casually without review by the leading organs, or they are unwilling to revise them even if the leadership points out errors. Criticism and self-criticism are not carried out for some erroneous literary and artistic works and authors. Zhang Panshi said: Since August last year, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau has convened two literary and art work conferences, and the North China Bureau has issued two instructions in September last year and November this year, criticizing these phenomena. As a result, considerable achievements have been made in this year's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and popularization work. The literary and art work conference in August this year also focused on pointing out the serious situation of neglecting ideological leadership in literary and art leadership, and proposed rectifying literary and art publications and launching an organized and planned creation movement, which has also begun to show results. However, because a systematic ideological education movement to establish the ideological leadership of the working class has not been widely carried out in the North China literary and art circles, some chaotic states in literary and artistic thought and individual serious ideological errors have not yet been completely resolved.
    Zhang Panshi then pointed out: Some old writers lack political enthusiasm and lose their sense of new things; some new young authors, under the cultivation and urging of the Party and the people, become complacent and arrogant with slight achievements, and gradually become divorced from the masses; the vast number of new authors are left to fend for themselves. This is a serious problem in North China's literary and art work. Our writers generally cannot see the new things of the great era and the new demands of the people, do not recognize today, and cannot see tomorrow. This is a very noteworthy issue.
    After recounting these erroneous thoughts and tendencies, Zhang Panshi emphatically pointed out the importance of carrying out the rectification movement in the literary and art circles, and at the same time put forward several requirements for improving the situation of literary and art work:
    1. The literary and art cause is a part of the entire revolutionary cause, and art must serve the revolutionary cause and obey the interests of the country and the people. 2. Literary and art workers must conscientiously transform their ideology. Literature and art must be led by the ideology of the working class. Literary and art workers must constantly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves. It is necessary to solve the question of "serving whom." 3. The task of writers is to educate the younger generation and arm the people ideologically. Every writer should constantly contribute his labor achievements to the people and should not use shoddy or substandard products to perfunctorily complete tasks. Writers should be bound by labor discipline. 4. Writers should take their lifestyle seriously, oppose the decadent outlook on life of the feudal class, and oppose the casual and lazy habits. The literary and art workers of the entire region should become literary and art fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought in their work and morality, and become active participants in any practical struggle. 5. The literary and art cause is a fighting cause, and the literary and art ranks are fighting ranks, and they cannot be reduced to an unorganized, undisciplined, and liberal rabble.
    After Zhang Panshi elaborated on the methods and steps of the rectification, he called on the comrades in the literary and art circles of the entire region to combine with the ongoing struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and earnestly carry out a rectification study movement, straighten out their thoughts, correct their positions, establish systems, and formulate work guidelines and plans, so as to meet greater tasks with a new attitude.

    中共中央华北局举行华北区文艺界整风学习动员大会
    中共中央华北局在十二月二十日举行华北区文艺界整风学习动员大会。出席的有华北文学艺术界筹备委员会、华北军区、华北事务部、华北级其他机关团体干部以及北京、天津两市及河北、察哈尔、内蒙古自治区等地的文艺领导干部和文艺工作者共约二百余人。会上首先由中共中央华北局第三书记刘澜涛讲话。他明确指出这次全区文艺界开展整风学习运动的意义和目的。他在说明了过去历次整风运动的伟大意义之后，着重提出，为了准备我国大规模的建设，为了迎接国家工业化的光辉灿烂的前途，全国正在开展增产节约、反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的严重斗争和思想改造工作及文艺界的整风学习运动，并指出这些极其重要的政治任务，都是要扫除我们前进道路上的障碍，肃清资产阶级思想的腐蚀作用，为国家大规模的建设作准备。
    会议继由中共中央华北局宣传部部长张磐石作报告。张磐石在介绍了北京文艺界整风学习的情况和经验之后，着重指出：北京文艺界整风学习中所提出的问题，在华北区也同样地存在着。华北区文艺工作的领导方面，同样存在着一种忽视思想、脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离工人阶级思想领导的倾向，党的文艺干部中也发展着某些无组织无纪律的现象。目前全国正在大张旗鼓地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，同时在文艺界中开展整风学习运动，发动严肃的批评和自我批评，克服错误思想，发扬正确思想，整顿文艺队伍，这是具有重大意义的。
    张磐石指出：两年来华北区文艺工作是有成绩的。但这些成绩和我们国家的各项成就还极不相称。文艺工作中还存在着如下几种不正确的倾向，阻碍着我们前进。首先是文艺统一战线问题。进入城市后，由于某些从解放区来的文艺工作者的思想没有得到彻底改造，开始抱着自满情绪，排斥新区的文艺工作者；经过党指出这种错误之后，他们也作了不少团结改造的工作。但当资产阶级、小资产阶级的文艺工作者向他们捧场时，他们就又放弃改造的工作，迁就资产阶级、小资产阶级的文艺思想，放弃工人阶级的思想领导。其次是文艺领导工作大部分是领导行政事务工作，忽视思想领导。不是集中精力研究有关文艺创作、批评等问题，而是集中注意于扩大编制、房屋、生活待遇等问题，以致使文艺团体的工作，没有战斗性、没有实际内容。第三，文艺创作上，曾经存在着严重的不问政治倾向。反映工农业生产的作品，常常是不联系国家利益的。某些作品穿上劳动人民的外衣，实际是表现小资产阶级的庸俗的思想感情。由于作家脱离现实、脱离政治，所以创作上普遍存在着老一套的毛病。进城两年多来，很少见到有较高思想性、艺术性、表现工人生活斗争的作品。劳动人民要求文化艺术生活，作家们却不能在创作上满足他们的要求。有些作家不愿参加实际斗争，关起门来，钻在古书堆里，专写历史题材，但又缺乏马克思主义的历史观点，写的常常是反历史主义的东西。第四是严重的形式主义，不考虑当地情况，不研究如何提高思想内容，一意摹仿大城市，特别是学习铺张华丽的形式。有些文工团进城以来，基本上没有把工农兵作为服务的主要对象，一心向往于西洋技术，轻视民族和民间艺术。第五是严重的粗制滥造和创作怠工的现象，同时并存。一方面粗制滥造，乱出刊物；一方面有些人名为作家，实际游手好闲，长期不写东西。第六，无组织无纪律和严重的自由主义。有些党的文艺作家的作品，不经领导机关审查随便出版，或经领导方面指出错误，他们也不愿修改。对一些有错误的文艺作品和作者，也不开展批评和自我批评。张磐石说：去年八月以来，华北局宣传部曾两次召开文艺工作会议，华北局去年九月和今年十一月又曾两次发出指示，批评了这些现象，因而在今年的抗美援朝爱国运动、镇压反革命运动和通俗化工作方面，都取得了相当成绩。今年八月的文艺工作会议，又着重指出在文艺领导上忽视思想领导的严重情况，提出整顿文艺刊物和开展有组织有计划的创作运动，也已初见成效。但因没有广泛地系统地在华北文艺界中开展一个确立工人阶级思想领导的思想教育运动，因而使得文艺思想上的某些混乱状态和个别严重的思想错误，仍未得到彻底解决。
    张磐石继又指出：有些老作家，缺乏政治热情，对新事物丧失感觉；有些新的青年作者，在党和人民的培养、督促下，稍有成就，便生长自满情绪和骄气，逐渐脱离群众；广大新生的作者自生自灭，这是华北文艺工作中的一个严重问题。我们的作家们，普遍看不见伟大时代的新事物和人民的新要求，不认识今天，也看不见明天，这是十分值得注意的问题。
    张磐石在历述了这些错误思想和倾向之后，着重指出文艺界开展整风运动的重要性，同时提出改进文艺工作状况的几点要求：
    一、文学艺术事业是整个革命事业的一部分，艺术必须为革命事业服务，服从国家和人民的利益。二、文艺工作者必须认真改造思想。文艺必须由工人阶级思想所领导。文艺工作者必须经常学习马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想，武装自己。一定要解决“为谁服务”的问题。三、作家的任务是教育青年一代，从思想上武装人民。每个作家应经常以自己的劳动成绩贡献给人民，不能拿粗制滥造的废品或次货来搪塞任务。作家应有劳动纪律的约束。四、作家要把自己的生活作风严肃起来，反对那种封建阶级腐朽的人生观，反对那种嘻嘻哈哈懒懒散散的习气。全区的文艺工作者们，应在工作和道德上成为无愧于毛泽东思想所武装起来的文艺战士，成为任何实际斗争的积极参加者。五、文学艺术事业是战斗的事业，文艺队伍是战斗的队伍，不能降低为无组织无纪律、自由主义的乌合之众。
    张磐石在详细阐述了整风的方法和步骤之后，他号召全区文艺界同志，要和正在开展的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争结合起来，认真开展一个整风学习运动，搞通思想，端正立场，确定制度，订出工作方针和计划，以新的姿态迎接更大的任务。
