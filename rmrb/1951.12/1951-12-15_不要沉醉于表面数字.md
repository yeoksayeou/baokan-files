Don't Be Intoxicated by Surface Numbers
Deputy Director of the Mechanical Administration Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government Gan Bai

The factories and mines under the Mechanical Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, ahead of schedule, overfulfilled the annual production increase and savings task by the end of September. This is an achievement created by all employees with high enthusiasm under the call of Chairman Gao Gang.

However, we must never be intoxicated by superficial numbers, let alone be complacent because we have exceeded the numbers. Generally speaking, numbers can illustrate work achievements, but in some cases, numbers not only fail to explain the problem, but are even a kind of illusion. Especially today, when we lack comprehensive quota management and accurate statistics, this phenomenon is inevitable. If we do not see this point and are misled by the numbers, thinking that the work has been done very well, it will lead to serious bad results for future work, preventing us from moving forward.

Why do we say that numbers cannot fully illustrate work achievements? This is because some of our units still have the following problems in completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy:

First, some factories have overfulfilled their tasks because the tasks assigned by the bureau and the plans made by the factory were not accurate or reasonable. For example, the work of the Twelfth Factory was not good in the past, and the masses were not mobilized after the campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched. However, because they disposed of a batch of stagnant materials in August, they overfulfilled the annual production increase and savings task ahead of schedule by the end of October.

Second, some factories have seen a sudden increase in the numbers exceeding the plan due to some special reasons. For example, the Sixth Factory, where the movement was well carried out, had completed 191% of the annual production increase and savings plan by the end of September. Among them, the item of saving circulating funds exceeded the original plan by more than 24 times. The main reason is that the unsalable cold goods in the past—water pumps—were completely sold out in September. In fact, there are still many areas in the factory's business management that need to be improved.

Third, some factories have significantly increased their overfulfillment numbers by changing the calculation method (in the past, the repairs of equipment by the factory's repair workers and the production tools manufactured for the factory's own use were not considered as part of the production, but now these are included in the task of increasing production and practicing economy). For example, for the Second Factory's savings in circulating funds, the bureau approved a task of 35,340 tons of grain, but calculated according to the new calculation method, 22,619 tons had been completed from January to July; for reducing costs, the task approved by the bureau was 22,267 tons, but calculated according to the new calculation method, 24,943 tons had already been completed in the first half of the year.

Fourth, some factories have exceeded the numbers by a lot, but because they have not effectively improved technical management, the achievements cannot be consolidated and have even regressed. For example, the Twelfth Factory completed 79.64% of the cost reduction task in the first half of the year; by the third quarter, due to the increase in defective products, the cost reduction ratio dropped to 25.15%, and in October it dropped to 19.49%. The cost plan of the Twentieth Factory was 57% completed in August, but regressed to 14% in September. The reason for this is that, in addition to price differences in allocation, the trial production cost almost doubled due to the large-scale rework of parts.

Fifth, many factories have completed the task of increasing production and practicing economy because one workshop or one task has been done well, while there are still many problems in other workshops and other departments that have not been resolved. For example, some factories still have many machine tools that have not been turned on, and some have already rusted. Phenomena such as tight at the beginning and loose at the end, tight at times and loose at other times, and waiting for materials to stop work are still common in workshops. The scrap rate in casting in some factories fluctuates, and some even reach more than 50%. More seriously, some factories have not only failed to mobilize workers well in the movement to increase production and practice economy, but even some responsible cadres do not know the specific figures of the task of increasing production and practicing economy. According to the report of the inspection team of the Shenyang Municipal Machinery Trade Union: the chairman of the trade union of the Twelfth Factory still did not know that the factory's production increase and savings plan had been increased from 60,000 tons of grain to 90,000 tons of grain after the factory had completed the annual production increase and savings task. The chairman of the trade union of the East Factory of the factory did not know whether the task of increasing production and practicing economy was arranged by the administration or the trade union; the cultural and educational committee member believed that the numbers of increasing production and practicing economy should be "kept secret" and that he was not a party member and "did not need to know." How can we expect such units to mobilize the masses? Isn't this enough to show that our work is still far from meeting the objective requirements? Therefore, we should regard continuing to deepen quality inspection and strengthening technical management in workshops as a powerful guarantee for exploring the potential of enterprises and completing and exceeding the plan for increasing production and practicing economy. All factories should humbly and strictly continue to expose shortcomings in work, especially in workshop management, find out the key problems in each workshop, and formulate specific plans to strengthen workshop work. Factories that have completed their tasks should quickly and carefully check whether there are any shortcomings in the plans made in the past, how the potential has been exploited, and how the business management has been improved; according to the specific situation, formulate excess plans, call on all employees to "go a step further," and strive to create more wealth for the country.

    不要沉醉于表面数字
    东北人民政府工业部机械管理局副局长　甘　柏
    东北人民政府工业部机械局所属厂矿，在九月底提前超额完成了全年增产节约任务，这是全体职工在高岗主席号召下，发挥高度热情创造出来的成绩。
    但是，我们绝不可沉醉于表面的数字，更不能因为超过了数字而自满。一般来说，数字是可以说明工作成绩的，但在某种情况下，数字不但不能说明问题，甚至是种假象。尤其是在我们缺乏全面定额管理和准确统计的今天，这种现象更是难免。如果我们不看到这一点，而为数字所迷惑，认为工作已经做得很好了，就将给今后的工作招致严重的恶果，使我们不能前进。
    为什么说数字不能完全说明工作成绩呢？这是因为我们有不少单位，在完成增产节约任务中，还存在着下面一些问题：
    一、有的厂是由于局分配的任务和本厂订的计划不够准确，或不合理，而超额完成了任务。比如，十二厂过去的工作并不好，开展增产节约运动后，群众也没有发动起来，但是因为他们在八月份处理了一批呆滞材料，到十月底就提前超额完成了全年增产节约任务。
    二、有的厂由于某种特殊原因，使计划超额的数字突然增加。比如，运动开展得较好的六厂，到九月底，已完成全年增产节约计划的百分之一百九十一。其中节约流动资金一项，超过原订计划二十四倍多。主要原因是九月份把过去没有销路的冷货——水泵，完全推销出去了。实际上该厂在经营管理上需要改善的地方还很多。
    三、有的厂由于改变了计算方法（以前厂内修理工人检修设备，和本厂制造自用的生产工具，都不算生产部分，现在把这些都算在增产节约任务内），超额数字显著增加了。比如，二厂节约流动资金，局核定的任务是三万五千三百四十吨粮食，但按新的计算方法一算，一至七月已完成了二万二千六百一十九吨；降低成本，局核定任务是二万二千二百六十七吨，按新计算方法计算，上半年就已经完成了二万四千九百四十三吨。
    四、有的厂数字超过很多，但由于没有切实改善技术管理，成绩不能巩固，反而倒退了。比如，十二厂降低成本任务，上半年已完成百分之七十九点六四；到了第三季度，由于废品增多，成本降低比例降到百分之二十五点一五，十月份又降到百分之十九点四九。二十厂的成本计划八月份已完成了百分之五十七，到九月份倒退到百分之十四。它的原因是，除了调拨价格发生差额外，试制成本由于部件大批返修，几乎提高了一倍。
    五、有许多工厂完成增产节约任务，是由于某一车间或某一项工作搞好了，而其它车间、其它部门，还存在着很多问题没有解决。比如，有些厂还有很多机床放在那里没开，有的已生了锈。前紧后松、时紧时松、停工待料等现象，在车间里还普遍存在着。某些工厂铸造上的废品率波动不定，有的甚至高达百分之五十以上。更为严重的是：个别工厂在增产节约运动中，不但没有很好地发动工人，甚至某些负责干部都不了解增产节约任务的具体数字是多少。据沈阳市机械工会检查小组汇报：十二厂工会主席在全厂已经完成了全年增产节约任务之后，还不知道全厂增产节约计划已由六万吨粮食提高到九万吨粮食。该厂东厂工会主席不知道增产节约任务是行政布置的还是工会布置的；文教委员则认为增产节约数字要“保密”，自己不是党员，“不需要知道”。像这样的单位，怎能设想他们会发动群众呢？这还不足以说明我们的工作还远远赶不上客观的要求吗？因此，我们应把继续深入质量检查、加强车间技术管理工作，看成是发掘企业潜力、完成与超过增产节约计划的有力保证。各厂应虚心而严格地继续揭发工作中尤其是车间管理上的缺点，找出各个车间的关键问题，订出加强车间工作的具体计划。已经完成任务的工厂，应迅速地认真检查过去订的计划有无缺点，潜在力发挥得如何，经营管理改善得如何；根据具体情况，制订出超额计划，号召全厂职工“百尺竿头再进一步”，争取为国家创造更多的财富。（原载“东北工业”）
