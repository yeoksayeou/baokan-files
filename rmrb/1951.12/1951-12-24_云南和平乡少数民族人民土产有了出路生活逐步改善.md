     Yunnan Heping Township Minority People's Native Products Find a Way Out, Living Standards Gradually Improve
    Editor: Most of the residents of Heping Township in Wuding County, Yunnan Province, belong to the Lisu and Dai ethnic groups. Before liberation, in addition to farming, they also engaged in the sideline occupation of weaving linen. At that time, they used one hundred pages of linen, five inches wide and twenty zhang long, to exchange for one sheng of rice. They had to carry the cloth to the market sixty li away to sell it. After deducting the minimum food expenses on the road, very little rice was left when they returned. Therefore, before liberation, they rarely ate rice. All the clothes they wore were made of linen, and most people's clothes and pants were patched. In winter, many people did not have quilts to cover themselves with, and some families of five or six people only had one torn quilt. This kind of quilt was often passed down for generations. Their poverty was unimaginable to ordinary people. After liberation, the state-owned trading company specially sent a trade team to Heping Township to guide them in linen production and help them sell it. The unreasonable price phenomenon of the past was also changed. Now, they can exchange the same one hundred pages of linen for one dou and eight sheng of rice, which is seventeen times higher than the price before liberation. This not only greatly stimulated their production enthusiasm but also improved their living standards. According to statistics from Zawowo Village in Heping Township, this year the people in the whole village can eat rice for an average of four months a year. Seventy percent of the township can now wear cotton clothes, and it is estimated that by the end of this year, everyone will be able to wear a set of new cotton clothes. In the past, they had not bought livestock for many years, but now they have bought many cattle, horses, mules, pigs, and sheep, and have also added agricultural implements. The Lisu farmers in Zawowo Village said, "Our parents gave birth to us, but they never arranged our lives well. Today, Chairman Mao has brought us a life with food and clothing. His kindness is deeper than our parents." In order to thank Chairman Mao with practical actions, they unanimously expressed that they would "actively produce, increase the strength to resist America and aid Korea, defend the motherland, and defend their fruits of victory."

     云南和平乡少数民族人民土产有了出路生活逐步改善
    编辑同志：云南省武定县和平乡的居民大多数属于傈僳族和泰族。解放前，他们除耕种土地外，还兼营织麻布的副业。那时他们用宽五寸、长二十丈的一百页麻布，换一升大米。他们要把布背到六十里以外的街上去卖，除了路上的最低吃用，回来时剩的米就很少了。因此在解放前，他们很少能够吃上大米。他们穿的衣服全都是麻布做的，大多数的人穿的衣、裤，还要打补钉。冬天很多人没有被子盖，有的全家五六口人只盖一条破被子。这种被子，常常要传留几代。他们生活的贫困是一般人难以设想的。解放后，国营贸易公司特别派了贸易小组到和平乡，指导他们进行麻布生产，并帮助他们推销。在价格上也改变了过去不合理的现象。现在他们拿和过去同样的一百页麻布，可以换到一斗八升大米，比解放前的价格要高出十七倍。这不只大大地刺激了他们的生产积极性，而且也改善了他们的生活。据和平乡杂窝村的统计：今年全村的人，平均一年之中可以吃四个月的大米了。全乡现在能够穿上棉布衣服的人，有百分之七十，估计今年年底每人平均都可穿上一套棉布新衣。过去他们多少年来都没有买过牲畜，现在买了很多牛、马、骡和猪、羊，并且还增添了农具。杂窝村傈僳族的农民说：“父母生下了我们，从来也没有把我们的生活安排好，今天毛主席才给我们带来有吃有穿的生活，他的恩情比父母还深。”为了用实际行动感谢毛主席，他们一致表示要“积极生产，增加抗美援朝力量，保卫祖国，保卫自己胜利果实”。    施明扬
