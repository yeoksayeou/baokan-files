    Relying on Workers to Develop Production at the Private ZhongSheng Textile and Dyeing Factory
    Liu Ming
    The private ZhongSheng Textile and Dyeing Factory in Beijing was recently rated as a first-class model factory by the Beijing Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the Beijing Textile and Dyeing Industry Association. The criteria for it being rated as a model were mainly: the quality of cloth produced for the state was good, production was carried out in accordance with state regulations, labor-management relations and production competitions were well-organized, donation plans were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, and taxes were not paid late, etc.
    The reason why the factory can achieve this is, of course, due to the patriotic spirit and production enthusiasm of all employees. However, the continuous progress of the factory's capitalists in their thinking, with the help of the People's Government and all factory employees, is also an important factor in achieving good production.
    Not long ago, cadres from the Beijing Company of the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation solicited opinions from the capitalists of the ZhongSheng Textile and Dyeing Factory on processing fees. Qi Jiepu, the shareholder representative of the factory, said: If we want to develop our factory, we will definitely not try to make a profit on processing fees. Even if you double the processing fees, if we do not rely on workers to improve production, we will still not be able to make money. This is precisely the experience that several capitalist managers of the ZhongSheng Textile and Dyeing Factory have gained from more than two years of work.
    The ZhongSheng Textile and Dyeing Factory was established after liberation. Before liberation, when manager Zhang Baiqing ran a factory, he always looked at the market to see which way the wind was blowing for prices, borrowed more money from the bank, and tried to buy cheap and sell expensive, never putting his mind on production. Shareholder representative Qi Jiepu had always been in business. In the past, in the shop, when he wanted an apprentice to do something, he would simply issue an order, and no one dared to say a word. Now workers want to talk about democracy, and if they have any opinions, they come to the manager's office to raise them. Qi Jiepu initially got a headache whenever he saw workers coming in.
    Under these circumstances, although the factory established a labor-management consultation meeting in August 1950, the meetings could not solve problems because they were just arguing. After several meetings, they stopped holding them. Although the workers had also launched two competitions, they could not get them going because they did not receive the support of the capitalists.
    Since October 1950, manager Zhang Baiqing began to participate in study sessions for industry and commerce circles in the Fourth District, studying the New Democratic economic policies, listening to reports every week, and engaging in discussions. Through learning, Zhang Baiqing gradually realized that in a New Democratic society, the responsibility of national capitalists is to develop production. To develop production, one must rely on workers. To rely on workers, one cannot oppress and look down on workers as in the past, but must put aside one's airs, consult with workers on everything, and care about the workers' welfare. He realized that his past attitude of being disgusted whenever he heard workers raise issues about their lives was wrong. Shareholder representative Qi Jiepu had a son who joined the revolutionary work after liberation. Every time he came to the factory, he always agreed with the workers' opinions and criticized his father's mistakes. Qi Jiepu gradually realized his own mistakes. In this way, the capitalists and workers were no longer standing on opposite sides. In the past, the labor-management consultation meeting did not go well because the capitalists did not trust the workers. After the capitalists made progress in their thinking, they began to trust the workers, and made the accounts public. Whenever the factory had any difficulties, they would bring them up and discuss them with the workers to find solutions together.
    In May and June of this year, the factory's capitalists and employees were further educated in patriotism to resist America and aid Korea. In particular, after hearing the reports from the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea about the Chinese People's Volunteers overcoming all kinds of difficulties and bravely fighting the enemy in Korea, everyone was deeply moved. In this way, labor and management were determined to work together to improve production, and reasonably resolved the long-standing wage issues and employee welfare issues. In June of this year, the factory wove 420 bolts of cloth. As a result of launching a patriotic production increase competition in July, 609 bolts were produced. Since then, the monthly output has been around 580 bolts. In the months before the competition, the factory lost money every month. After the competition, there was a surplus. The increased production in July, August, and September, after exceeding the donation of 7.9 million yuan and workers taking a portion of the bonus, the capitalists could still have a surplus of 5 million yuan.
    Now both labor and management have a high level of production enthusiasm. Each worker group has established a patriotic pact, and each person has made a production plan. The capitalists of ZhongSheng Textile and Dyeing Factory are now full of hope and confidence. They recently added four more machines and, under the leadership and support of the People's Government, plan to further expand their factory.

    依靠工人发展生产的私营众生织染厂
    刘明
    北京市私营众生织染厂最近被中国花纱布公司北京市公司和北京市织染业公会评为一等模范厂。它被评为模范的条件主要是：给国家加工生产的布匹质量好，根据国家的规定进行生产，劳资关系和生产竞赛搞得好，捐献计划提前超额完成，不滞纳税款等。
    该厂所以能作到这样，当然是由于全体职工发扬了爱国精神和生产积极性。但该厂资方在人民政府及全厂职工的帮助下，思想上不断进步，也是搞好生产的一个重要因素。
    不久以前，国营花纱布公司北京市公司的干部曾向众生织染厂资方征求对加工工缴费的意见。该厂股东代表齐洁璞表示：我们要发展自己的厂子，决不在加工工缴费上打算盘，即让你把工缴费增加一倍，我们如不好好依靠工人改进生产，也还是不能赚钱的。这也正是众生织染厂几个资方经理人员从两年多的工作中所获得的经验。
    众生织染厂是在解放后开办的。经理张柏青解放前办工厂时，总是到市场看看物价的风头，跑银行多借点款，想法买贱卖贵，根本不把心思放到生产上。股东代表齐洁璞过去一直是干买卖的，过去在柜上，要徒弟干个什么，都是一声令下，谁也不敢说半个不字。现在工人要讲民主，有意见就要到经理室来提。齐洁璞当初一见工人进来就头痛。
    在这种情况下，该厂虽然在一九五○年八月就成立了劳资协商会议，因为开会光争吵不能解决问题，开过几次会也就不开了。工人虽也发动过两次竞赛，因为得不到资方的支持，也搞不起来。
    自一九五○年十月，经理张柏青开始参加四区工商界的学习会，学习新民主主义的经济政策，每星期都听报告，并进行讨论。张柏青在学习中逐渐认识到，在新民主主义社会，民族资本家的责任就是要发展生产。要发展生产就得依靠工人。要依靠工人，就不能像过去那样压迫和瞧不起工人，就要放下架子，遇事和工人商量，关心工人的福利事业。想到过去一听到工人提生活问题就起反感的态度是不对的。股东代表齐洁璞有个儿子解放后参加了革命工作，他每次到厂里去，总是赞同工人的意见，批评他父亲的不对。齐洁璞也逐渐觉悟到自己的错误。这样，资方和工人不再是站在对立的地位了。过去劳资协商会议开不好，是因为资方不相信工人。资方在思想上有了进步之后，他们开始相信工人，并把账目公开，厂里有什么困难，就提出来和工人共同商量解决。
    在今年五、六月间，该厂资方和职工进一步受到了抗美援朝爱国主义教育，特别是听到中国人民赴朝慰问团报告中国人民志愿军在朝鲜克服种种困难英勇打击敌人的情形，大家深受感动。这样，劳资双方决心共同努力，搞好生产，并合理解决了争执已久的工资问题和职工福利问题。今年六月，该厂织布四百二十匹。七月份开展爱国增产竞赛的结果，生产了六百零九匹。自此以后，每月产量都在五百八十匹左右。竞赛前几个月，厂方每月都要亏赔，竞赛后就有了盈余。七、八、九三个月增产所得，除超额完成了七百九十万元的捐献及工人提取一部分奖金外，资方还可盈余五百万元。
    现在劳资双方的生产情绪都很高。工人每组都订有爱国公约，每人订有生产计划。众生织染厂的资方现在满怀希望和信心，最近又增加了四部机子，在人民政府的领导和扶助之下，打算进一步扩大自己的厂子。
