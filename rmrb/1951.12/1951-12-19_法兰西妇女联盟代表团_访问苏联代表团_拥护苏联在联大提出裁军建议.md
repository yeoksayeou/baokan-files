Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 15th: According to TASS, a delegation from the French Women's Union visited the Soviet delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly, expressing the sincere support of French women for the Soviet delegation's proposal regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments and armed forces.

The delegation from the French Women's Union was warmly welcomed by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, the deputy head, Malik, and the secretary-general, Podtserob. The delegation handed Vyshinsky a letter from the French Women's Union, which included the resolution on defending peace from the "French Women's National Conference for Disarmament" held in March this year, and the conference's appeal to the United Nations to support the ten proposals of the Second World Peace Congress. The General Secretary of the French Women's Union, Chaumel, and another leader of the Union, Marty-Giaraud, expressed the French women's desire for peace to Vyshinsky. They said: French women will fight for the victory of the Soviet proposal aimed at eliminating the danger of war and ensuring peace.

Vyshinsky expressed his warm thanks to the delegation of the French Women's Union for their visit. He said: The Soviet Union has been fighting for peace for thirty-four years. The first word spoken after the birth of the Soviet Republic was "peace," and the first decree of the Soviet government was the Decree on Peace, because peace is inseparable from socialism, and war is socialism's mortal enemy. The work of the Soviet delegation in the United Nations General Assembly is arduous, and its situation is like a lone island in a stormy sea. Therefore, when we see the seasoned peace fighters – the French women with glorious traditions – expressing their friendship and support to us, we receive great spiritual support. This kind of support is extremely necessary for our struggle.

In recent days, people from all walks of life in France have continuously sent representatives to visit the Soviet delegation, or have written letters and telegrams to the Soviet delegation, expressing their enthusiastic support for the Soviet peace proposals.

    法兰西妇女联盟代表团
    访问苏联代表团
    拥护苏联在联大提出裁军建议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：法兰西妇女联盟的代表团访问了苏联出席联合国大会的代表团，表示法国妇女竭诚拥护苏联代表团关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备与武装部队的建议。
    法兰西妇女联盟代表团受到苏联代表团团长维辛斯基、副团长马立克和秘书长波得切罗夫的热烈欢迎。代表团把法兰西妇女联盟的信交给维辛斯基，信中附有今年三月“法兰西妇女争取裁减军备全国大会”保卫和平的决议和大会要求联合国支持第二届世界和平大会十点建议的呼吁书。法兰西妇女联盟总书记萧玛和联盟的另一个领袖马尔梯—贾拉伯向维辛斯基表达了法国妇女的和平愿望。她们说：法国妇女要为旨在消灭战争危险、确保和平的苏联提案的胜利而斗争。
    维辛斯基对法兰西妇女联盟代表团的来意表示热烈感谢。他说：苏联已经为和平斗争了三十四年。苏维埃共和国诞生后所说的第一句话就是“和平”，苏维埃政府的第一个法令就是和平法令，因为和平是和社会主义分不开的，而战争则是社会主义的死敌。苏联代表团在联合国大会中的工作是艰巨的，它的处境好似风暴中大海上的孤岛一样。因此，我们看到久经锻炼的和平战士——有着光荣传统的法兰西妇女对我们表示友好和声援，我们就得到了精神上极大的支持。这种支持对我们的斗争是极为需要的。
    近日以来，不断有法国各阶层人民派代表来访问苏联代表团，或者写信、拍电报给苏联代表团，表示热烈支持苏联的和平建议。
