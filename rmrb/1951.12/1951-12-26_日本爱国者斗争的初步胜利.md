    Preliminary Victory of the Japanese Patriots' Struggle
    After nearly two months of so-called trials, the Sendai High Court of the Japanese reactionary government had to decide on the 20th of this month to retry the "Matsukawa Incident." This is a preliminary victory for the twenty innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," achieved through their resolute struggle with the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people and the people of other countries around the world.
    More than two years ago, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries shamelessly fabricated the so-called "Matsukawa train derailment incident," illegally arrested twenty Japanese patriots, and unreasonably sentenced them to death and imprisonment, attempting to use this to suppress the patriotic movement of the Japanese people. However, the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries was in vain. The illegal trials and prison tortures not only failed to dampen the fighting will of the innocent defendants, but instead made the broad masses of Japanese patriotic people more aware of the hideous face of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous behavior of the Yoshida government, thus arousing even greater anger among the Japanese people, who rose up to wage a resolute struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The Japanese people launched a million-signature campaign to rescue the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The twenty innocent Japanese patriots heroically persisted in their struggle in court and in prison, sternly rebuking and exposing the despicable conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. This forced the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries into an extremely embarrassing situation.
    The unyielding struggle carried out by the innocent defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" and the Japanese patriotic people has won the unanimous support of the Chinese people and all upright people in the world. This greatly encouraged the fighting will and confidence in victory of the Japanese people and the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and put great pressure on the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.
    The preliminary victory of the "Matsukawa Incident" struggle illustrates a very important truth: No matter how violent and shameless U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Japan appear before the Japanese people, as long as the Japanese people unite broadly and continue to persist in the struggle, they will certainly be able to defeat them.

    日本爱国者斗争的初步胜利
    经过近两个月的所谓审讯以后，日本反动政府的仙台高等裁判所不得不在本月二十日决定重审“松川事件”。这是日本“松川事件”全体二十名无辜被告在日本广大人民和世界其他各国人民支持下坚决进行斗争的初步胜利。
    两年多以前，美日反动派极端无耻地制造了所谓“松川列车颠覆事件”，非法逮捕了二十名日本爱国者，并无理地对他们分别判处了死刑和徒刑，妄图借此来镇压日本人民的爱国运动。但是美日反动派的阴谋是徒然的。非法的审讯和牢狱的折磨不但丝毫不能挫折无辜被告者的斗争意志，相反的却使广大的日本爱国人民更加认清了美帝国主义的狰狞面目和吉田政府的卖国行为，因而激起了日本人民更大的愤怒，起来向美日反动派展开了坚决的斗争。日本人民为救援“松川事件”无辜被告曾展开百万人的签名运动。二十名无辜被告的日本爱国者在法庭上和牢狱中英勇坚持斗争，严厉地斥责和揭穿了美、日反动派的卑鄙阴谋。这样就使得美、日反动派不能不陷入极端狼狈的境地。
    日本“松川事件”无辜被告和日本爱国人民所进行的不屈不挠的斗争，获得了中国人民和全世界正直人士的一致声援。这大大地鼓舞了日本人民和“松川事件”无辜被告者的斗争意志和胜利信心，并使美、日反动派感受到了极大的压力。
    “松川事件”斗争的初步胜利，说明了一个十分重要的真理：不管美国帝国主义及其在日本的走狗在日本人民面前表现得如何的狂暴和无耻，但是日本人民只要广泛地团结起来，并继续坚持斗争，就一定可以战胜它们。
