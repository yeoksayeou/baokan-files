    Lessons from the Yuan Jia Yao Fraudulent National Loan Case

    The case of Yuan Jia Yao, manager of the private Zhenyuan Coal Mine Company in Guangdong, fraudulently obtaining national loans should arouse our high vigilance.

    Yuan Jia Yao is a big swindler, a disgrace to the industrial and commercial circles. He used all kinds of despicable and dirty methods to defraud the state of huge loans. His trickery was used as many as nine times, and his fraud lasted for a year, but it was not discovered for a long time. This situation shows how shockingly serious the bureaucratic style of some comrades in the South China Financial and Economic Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Administration of Industry and Commerce is. They completely lost their vigilance against the奸商 (crafty merchants) who are constantly attacking state property. They listened to the sweet words of the crafty merchants and believed them all without any investigation or research; after paying the loan to the crafty merchants, they completely abandoned the responsibility of inspection and supervision. The personnel sent to the site for inspection were completely surrounded by the crafty merchants. They only listened to the crafty merchants and did not ask the workers who were being oppressed by the crafty merchants and unable to live. This is the main reason why this huge fraud could occur and remain undetected for a long time.

    It should be recognized that crafty merchants are trying every possible means to attack state property. Their most insidious and vicious method is to exploit the loopholes of bureaucrats. Many cases of crafty merchants endangering state property have occurred in this way. Therefore, in order to protect state property, it is necessary to seriously examine and overcome the bureaucratic style of state employees, and punish some serious bureaucrats. As long as the bureaucratic style is thoroughly overcome, the crafty merchants will have no way to use their tricks.

    袁家尧诈骗国家贷款案的教训
    广东私营振源煤矿公司经理袁家尧诈骗国家贷款案，应该引起我们高度的警惕。
    袁家尧是个大骗子，是工商界的败类。他用种种卑鄙龌龊的办法，骗取了国家的巨额贷款。他的骗术施展到九次之多，他的骗局持续达一年之久，但长期未被发觉。这种情况，说明华南财政经济委员会和广东省工商管理部门某些同志的官僚主义作风，严重到多么惊人的程度。他们对于随时向国家财产进攻的奸商，完全丧失了警惕性。他们听了奸商的甜言蜜语，毫不调查研究，就全部信以为真；把贷款付给奸商后，完全放弃了检查、监督的责任。派往现场检查的人员，完全被奸商包围了。他们只听奸商的话，而不去问问被奸商欺压得无法生活的工人。这就是这个巨大骗局得以发生以及长期未被发觉的主要原因。
    应该认识，奸商正在千方百计地向国家财产进攻。他们最阴险最毒辣的方法，就是钻官僚主义者的空子。许多奸商危害国家财产案，都是这样发生的。因此，为了保护国家的财产，必须认真检查和克服国家工作人员的官僚主义作风，惩办某些严重的官僚主义分子。只要彻底克服了官僚主义作风，奸商就再没有方法施展他们的伎俩。
