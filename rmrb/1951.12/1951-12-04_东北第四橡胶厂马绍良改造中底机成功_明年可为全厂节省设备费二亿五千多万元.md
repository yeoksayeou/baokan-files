Ma Shaoliang, an advanced producer at the Northeast Fourth Rubber Factory, successfully modified the insole machine with firm determination and perseverance. By the end of this year, the insole group of the factory's shoe upper workshop will have increased production and saved the equivalent of 270 tons of grain for the country.

Of the ten insole machines used in the Fourth Rubber Factory's shoe upper workshop, only one "8124" type machine can produce continuously. The remaining nine "816" type machines made in Japan have to have their needles changed more than ten times a day, and each machine is out of production for an average of one and a half hours per day. Therefore, the insole group of the shoe upper workshop often fails to complete its monthly task of producing 13,000 pairs of soles, which affects the factory's production increase and savings plan.

Last winter, Ma Shaoliang, a maintenance worker in the shoe upper workshop, wanted to use old machine parts from the factory to改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel) the insole machine and convert all the "816" type machines into "8124" type machines. He discussed it with the group leader, Xu Bangquan, but Xu Bangquan said at the time, "Don't underestimate that insole machine, it's only half a foot high, but it's made up of more than two hundred precision parts. The Japanese wanted to改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel) it during the puppet Manchuria period, but they didn't succeed. I've been guarding this machine for more than ten years, and I haven't dared to think about改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ing it!" Ma Shaoliang strongly disagreed with this kind of blindly worshiping the technology of capitalist countries. Soon after, Xu Bangquan took a sick leave, and Ma Shaoliang took over as the head of the maintenance group. Although the tasks increased, he still did not relax his research. Every time the insole machine had a problem, he disassembled it and carefully pondered it. At the same time, he also put in extra effort to study the "8124" type machine.

After Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, proposed the call to increase production and save five million tons of grain, his enthusiasm grew even greater. He was determined to find the "potential power" in this machine. He caressed these rollers, shafts, bottom needles, gears and other parts countless times, studying how to改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel) them. However, for a long time, he still couldn't think of a good way to make the needle of the "816" type machine longer, which was the key to the machine's frequent malfunctions. After getting off work and returning home, he held books on mechanical theory such as fitter and lathe worker and read them until late at night. His elementary school education made it difficult for him to study, but he kept the things he didn't understand in his mind, and the next day, he went to ask the technicians for advice. When the factory director learned that Ma Shaoliang was researching and改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ing the insole machine, he attached great importance to it, allocated nearly 10 million yuan for research expenses, and encouraged him, "Don't be discouraged, we'll count when the research is successful!"

On a night in early August, Ma Shaoliang finally succeeded. This time, he received help from Xu Bangquan. Xu Bangquan had recovered from his illness and returned to work. He was moved by Ma Shaoliang's spirit of hard work and painstaking research day and night, so he helped Ma Shaoliang think of a way. He asked Ma Shaoliang to try replacing the round-head pull rod on the "8124" type machine with the "816" type machine. After the replacement, because the pull rod was too long, it was blocked by the crank, and the machine was difficult to rotate. Ma Shaoliang pondered for a long time, and suddenly thought, "Why not shorten the crank a little?" After another test, the machine's rotation speed increased, the intersection of the bottom needle and the fork needle widened, and thus the length of the machine needle increased, the efficiency of the machine was improved, and the rate of downtime was reduced by one-third.

The next day, Ma Shaoliang first改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ed the insole machine used by Chen Fengde according to this method. When using it, all the workers in the group were very satisfied and asked to改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel) the machine in the same way. However, Ma Shaoliang was not satisfied because he saw that the efficiency of the machine after改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ation was still not as good as that of the "8124" type. Therefore, after another half a month of careful research, he改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ed the shaft, making the jumping distance of the machine needle even greater. After four or five consecutive improvements, he finally achieved the goal of completely改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ing the "816" type machine into an "8124" type machine. The successful改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ation of the insole machine increased labor productivity, and the workers in the insole group were all elated. After all nine "816" type machines in the entire workshop were改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ed at the end of August, the insole group's production tasks were completed or even exceeded every month. From August to October, the average monthly production of the group reached 15,000 pairs. By the end of this year, the group can save more than 90 million yuan in spare parts and needle consumption costs, and can increase production by 80,000 pairs of midsoles, the two items converted into 270 tons of grain. According to the nine machines that have been改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ed and the seven insole machines planned to be改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel)ed from old machines, the Fourth Rubber Factory can save more than 250 million yuan from the cost of increasing equipment next year.

Ma Shaoliang, this advanced producer who has won awards nine times in a row since the New Record Movement, recently received a gold-plated medal and a bonus from the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government. But he is never satisfied with his achievements. Now, he is continuing to research the method of one person operating two sewing machines, and plans to further改造 (gaizao; transform/remodel) the insole machine so that it can be equipped with automatic scissors, in order to further improve the efficiency of the machine.

    东北第四橡胶厂马绍良改造中底机成功
    明年可为全厂节省设备费二亿五千多万元
    东北第四橡胶厂先进生产者马绍良以坚强的决心和毅力，改造中底机成功，使该厂制帮车间中底组到今年年底可为国家增产节约等于二百七十吨粮食的财富。
    第四橡胶厂制帮车间使用的十台中底机中，除了一台“八一二四式”机能够不间断地生产外，其余九台日本造的“八一六式”机每天都要换十几次机针，平均每台机器每天有一个半钟头不能生产。所以制帮车间中底组每月生产一万三千双鞋底的任务经常不能完成，全厂的增产节约计划也因此受到影响。
    去年冬天，制帮车间保全工人马绍良就想用厂里的旧机器零件来改造中底机，把“八一六式”机都改装成“八一二四式”机。他曾经和组长徐邦全商量，但是当时徐邦全说：“你别看那中底机才半尺多高，它是由二百多个精密零件构成的。伪满时日本人想改造它都没有成功。我守着这个机器十几年了，也没敢想去改造它呢！”马绍良很不同意这种盲目崇拜资本主义国家的技术的看法。不久，徐邦全因病休养，马绍良接替保全组长的工作。任务虽然增加，但他仍然毫不放松钻研。每次中底机出了毛病，他就大拆大卸，仔细揣摸，同时对那台“八一二四式”机器，也特别下功夫研究。
    东北人民政府主席高岗提出关于增产节约五百万吨粮食的号召以后，他的劲头更大了。他决心从这机器身上找出“潜在力量”来。他不止千百次地抚摸着这些滚珠、轴杠、底针、齿轮等零件，研究如何改造。但是，好久了，他仍然没有想出一个好办法来使“八一六式”的机针变得长些，而这却是这个机器常常发生毛病的关键所在。他下工回家后，就抱着有关钳工、车工等机械理论的书籍不放，常常读到深夜。初小的文化程度，使他在学习时感到很吃力；但他把不懂的地方都记在心上，第二天，就去请教技术人员。厂长知道马绍良在研究改造中底机，非常重视，拨给他将近一千万元的研究费，并鼓励他说：“不要灰心，几时研究成功几时算！”
    在八月初的一个夜晚，马绍良终于成功了。这次，他得到了徐邦全的帮助。徐邦全已经病愈复工，他被马绍良日夜苦心钻研的精神所感动，就帮助马绍良想办法。他叫马绍良把“八一二四式”机上的圆头拉杠换到“八一六式”机上试试。换过以后，因为拉杠太长，被拐子挡住，机器转动很吃力。马绍良又揣摸了许久，忽然想到：“何不把拐子截短一些？”经过再次的试验，机器转动加快，底针和叉针的交差扩大，因而机针的长度增加，机器的效率就提高了，停修率减低了三分之一。
    第二天，马绍良按照这个方法首先改造了陈凤德所使用的中底机。使用时，全组工人都很满意，都要求把机器照样改装。但马绍良并不满足，因为他看到改装后机器的效能还不及“八一二四式”。于是，他又经过半个多月的仔细钻研，把轴杠改造了，使机针跳动的距离更增大一些。连续作了四、五次改进以后，他终于达到了把“八一六式”机完全改装成“八一二四式”机的目的。中底机改造成功，提高了劳动生产率，中底组的工人无不兴高采烈。全车间九台“八一六式”机在八月底全部改装后，中底组的生产任务就月月完成甚至超过。从八月到十月，该组每月生产量平均达到了一万五千双。到今年年底，该组共可节省零件和机针的消耗费九千多万元，可增产八万双中底，两项折合粮食二百七十吨。按照已改装的九台机器和计划从旧机器改装的七台中底机计算，第四橡胶厂可从明年增加设备的费用中节省两亿五千多万元。
    马绍良，这位从新纪录运动以来已连续九次得奖的先进生产者，最近又得到了东北人民政府工业部的一枚镀金奖章和一笔奖金。但他永远不满足于自己的成绩。现在，他正在继续钻研着一人操作两台缝纫机的方法，并计划进一步改装中底机，使它能带上自动剪刀，以便更加提高机器的效率。
