In 1952, the national state-owned trade system aims to save 8 trillion yuan by accelerating capital turnover. To accomplish this task, staff members of state-owned trade enterprises nationwide—especially leading staff—must improve their service attitude towards the people, launch active sales campaigns, expand sales revenue, and meet the masses' demands for goods. This is the key issue in accelerating capital turnover. Currently, many staff members in state-owned trade enterprises in various regions still lack sufficient understanding of the importance of accelerating capital turnover. Particularly, serious conservative reluctance to sell exists among some leading staff, hindering the acceleration of enterprise capital turnover and affecting market supply.

What are the specific manifestations of conservative reluctance to sell? Based on what we have seen so far, there are the following types:

I.  Willing to transfer goods in, but unwilling to transfer goods out; even sitting idly by while neighboring companies experience stockouts, refusing to transfer goods to them. For example, the Tianjin Industrial Materials Company had an inventory of over 1,000 tons of caustic soda in October, with monthly processing revenue potentially reaching over 1,000 tons, while monthly sales never exceeded 800 tons. However, they dared neither to sell boldly nor to allow the head office to allocate it to Shanghai. The Guangdong Provincial Department Store previously had an inventory of 8,000 packages of Liuhua candy, sitting idly by while the Guangzhou City Company experienced a stockout of Liuhua candy, refusing to allocate it. The Subei Dongtai Department Store Branch experienced a supply-demand imbalance of kerosene in mid-November, sending someone to its affiliated Anfeng Business Office to allocate ten large barrels (the office had enough inventory for fifty days of sales); this business office emphasized difficulties in every way, only willing to allocate five large barrels. Similar examples exist in many other regions.

II. Willing to order more fast-selling goods but unwilling to vigorously promote them, while also not actively seeking ways to open up sales for general, non-branded goods. Emphasizing that the sales plan cannot be completed because the higher authorities did not allocate enough fast-selling goods, to cover up their conservative reluctance to sell and their "brand-name goods ideology." The South Sichuan Department Store had an inventory of 90,000 dozen towels in October, but only sold 6,000 dozen; it had an inventory of 56,000 bolts of cloth, but only sold 10,500 bolts. The Shandong Jiawang Yarn and Cloth Promotion Team sold three bolts of cloth at a large market day, two bolts at a small market day, and one bolt on weekdays. When there were more customers, they reduced the number of salespersons to delay the time. The Hubei Province Hedaoguan Department Store Branch's inventory and processed purchases at the end of the third quarter were equivalent to more than twice the sales plan for the fourth quarter; but it still blindly hoarded goods, stopped wholesale, and withdrew the promotion team, so that cotton farmers could not buy department store goods after selling cotton, and the masses said: "The department store is a 'shortage store.'"

III. Only willing to expand retail, but not simultaneously actively expanding wholesale. This will never complete the sales task. We must actively expand wholesale and mobilize the power of all public-private cooperative commercial enterprises to fully supply consumers' needs. In many places, department stores stop wholesale to private merchants (or limit sales) when a certain commodity is selling well, exclusively supplying their own retail outlets; as a result, they pile up large quantities of fast-selling goods in warehouses, making it impossible for capital to turn over, and consumers cannot get enough supply.

IV. Unauthorized increase in the prices of fast-selling goods. This is an erroneous behavior resulting from the combination of conservative reluctance to sell and a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. The Tangshan Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, seeing that Soviet cloth was selling well, increased the price by 300 yuan per foot. The Wei County Department Store increased the wholesale and retail price difference for kerosene to 40%. The Tianjin Municipal Department Store increased the regional price difference for Shanghai-produced alarm clock waxed paper to 39.8%, and the Beijing Municipal Department Store even increased it to 48%.

V. Regarding commodities that the higher authorities require to be "sold under planned control," they believe that the less sold, the better, and that it is acceptable not to complete the plan. Some commodities, even during peak sales seasons, become unsalable off-season goods due to "controlled sales." For example, the Tianjin Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company currently has an inventory of over 100,000 bolts of bleached and light-colored summer cloth, which cannot be sold. They do not understand that "controlled sales" only refers to selling according to plan, not exceeding the plan, but the plan must be completed.

VI. Passively sitting at the counter waiting for customers to buy. They believe that their goods are in "short supply," so there is no need for active promotion and expanded sales, and people will come to them on their own. The Zhengzhou Municipal Department Store has an inventory of over 800 rolls of paper, refusing to sign a processing contract with the cigarette factory, instead believing that "paper is a company-sold material, and the factory will always have to buy it from us."

Conservative reluctance to sell not only causes capital to be tied up, preventing enterprises from completing their sales plans, but also creates a blind panic about the market among cadres who have this kind of thinking. This panic further affects the market, making many people feel that individually undersupplied materials are even more insufficient. Prices that could have been stabilized cannot be stabilized, giving unscrupulous merchants an opportunity to exploit. This harm is very serious.

Why do these people face large quantities of goods and yet are reluctant to sell? The main problem is that they blindly believe that today's industrial products are insufficient. Therefore, they cannot comprehend the spirit of the superior's instructions to "vigorously promote sales, support procurement, and stabilize prices," and are unwilling to resolutely implement them. They have not conducted investigation and research or analysis: Are all kinds of industrial products insufficient today? Or are only certain industrial products insufficient? Is it insufficient nationwide? Or is it insufficient in individual places for a certain period of time? Is it slightly insufficient or very insufficient? They only see a slight increase in sales of certain commodities in individual locations at individual times, and then believe that the entire commodity situation is insufficient. They then take inappropriate measures such as limiting sales and stopping wholesale, while shouting loudly to the higher authorities to request increased allocation. They use past methods of stabilizing prices to control today's prices. Today, state-owned trade enterprises have sufficient material strength, which basically matches the needs of the market. Therefore, the most effective way to stabilize prices now is to sell the materials in hand in large quantities and recover currency.

Secondly, the purely profit-seeking thinking and behavior of some cadres, who think they can "keep the goods in hand and sell them later to earn more money," also causes commodity accumulation. In addition, failure to understand their own resources and bureaucratic work styles in business operations are also important reasons for accumulating capital. Therefore, while opposing conservative reluctance to sell, we must also oppose purely profit-seeking capitalist thinking and bureaucratic work styles.

Since the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government issued instructions to resolutely overcome conservative reluctance to sell, state-owned trade enterprises in various regions have made some improvements in business management in the past two months, but they should further overcome conservative reluctance to sell in the future. How to overcome it? 1. Strengthen ideological education, eliminate the above ideological obstacles, and make all cadres understand: Only by vigorously promoting sales, accelerating capital turnover, and ensuring supply can we stimulate production and guarantee long-term price stability, and can we most effectively achieve the task of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned trade enterprises. 2. Leading cadres of trade administrative departments and state-owned trade enterprises at all levels should attach importance to and inspect the work of plan execution, and should carefully look at the daily import, sales, and inventory report figures of their affiliated companies every day, as well as the percentage of completed plan figures, to understand the business situation and resources in a timely manner, study changes in market conditions in a timely manner, and improve work at any time. 3. Seriously check and inventory stocks, conduct commodity ranking, and develop different sales methods for different commodities; increase the number of discount departments and promote the sale of slow-moving and defective goods. 4. Conduct price inspections. If the market price of a certain commodity is higher than the listed price, and the company operating this commodity has a sufficient inventory, it is necessary to resolutely and actively sell it to bring the market price to the level of the listed price. 5. The phenomenon of accumulation of seasonal goods must be eliminated. Winter goods must be sold out in winter (especially in department stores), and it is better to have a few days of stockouts at the end of the season than to allow a large number of off-season unsalable goods to accumulate again. 6. In terms of operating methods, resolutely overcome the phenomenon of waiting for customers to come to the door. We must mobilize all employees to carry out sales competitions and actively contact various agencies, groups, cooperatives, merchants, hawkers, and other customers for sales. And according to the conditions of various different commodities, we should adopt methods such as organizing department store exhibitions, going to rural fairs and temple fairs, contacting before delivering goods, and expanding publicity to strengthen contact with consumers.

### 克服保守惜售思想，加速资金周转

    克服保守惜售思想，加速资金周转
    中央贸易部国内贸易司副司长    张翼飞
    一九五二年国营贸易系统要求在加速资金周转方面，节约资金八万亿元。为了完成这个任务，全国国营贸易企业的工作人员——特别是领导工作人员，必须改进对人民的服务态度，开展积极的销货运动，扩大卖钱额，满足群众对货物的要求。这是加速资金周转的关键问题。目前，各地国营贸易企业中，有许多工作人员，对加速资金周转的重要意义仍然认识不足。特别是在一部分领导工作人员中，有严重的保守惜售思想，障碍着企业资金周转的加速，影响市场的供应。
    保守惜售思想有那些具体表现呢？就目前看到的有下面这几种：
    一、愿意调进货物，不愿调出货物；甚至坐视邻近公司脱销，也不肯调给。比如：天津工业器材公司在十月份库存烧碱一千多吨，每月加工收入可达到一千多吨，而每月销售量从来没有超过八百吨。可是，他们既不敢大胆出售，又抵抗总公司向上海调拨。广东省百货公司前库存榴花糖八千包，坐视广州市公司榴花糖脱销而不肯调拨。苏北东台百货支公司十一月中旬煤油供求失调，派人到所属安丰营业所调拨十大桶（该所库存足够五十天销售）；这个营业所多方强调困难，只肯调出五大桶。其他地区类似的例子还很多。
    二、对顺销货愿多要而不肯大力推销，对一般非名牌货却又不积极设法打开销路。强调销货完不成计划是由于上级没调给足够的顺销货，以掩盖自己的保守惜售思想和“名牌货思想”。川南百货公司十月份存有毛巾九万打，只销出六千打；存布五万六千匹，只销出一万零五百匹。山东贾旺纱布推销小组，大集一天卖三匹布，小集一天卖两匹布，平日卖一匹布。顾客多了，就减少售货员，以拖延时间。湖北省河道观百货支公司第三季度末库存及加工采购进货，相当于第四季度销货计划的两倍以上；但仍盲目惜售，停止了批发，撤回了推销小组，使棉农售棉后买不到百货，群众说：“百货公司是缺货公司”。
    三、只愿意扩大零售，而不同时积极地扩大批发。这样是决不能完成销货任务的。必须积极扩大批发，把一切公私合作社商业的力量发动起来，才能充分供应消费者的需要。不少地方的百货公司都是在某种货物顺销时，就停止对私商批发（或限量出售），专供自己门市零售；结果，把大批的顺销货压在仓库里，使资金无法周转，消费者得不到足够的供应。
    四、擅自提高顺销货价格。这是保守惜售思想和单纯营利观点结合之下产生的错误行为。唐山花纱布公司看到苏联花布畅销，每尺提价三百元。威县百货公司把煤油的批发和零售差价扩大到百分之四十。天津市百货公司把上海出产的警钟腊纸地区差价提到百分之三十九点八，北京市百货公司甚至提到百分之四十八。
    五、对上级要求“按计划掌握出售”的商品，认为卖的越少越好，可以不完成计划。甚至有些商品在销售旺季时，由于“掌握出售”的结果，积压成过季节的冷背货。比如天津花纱布公司现存漂白和浅色夏令布十几万匹，没法推销。他们不了解“掌握出售”只是指按计划出售，不要超过计划，但必须完成计划。
    六、消极地坐柜台等客求购。他们认为自己的货是
    “缺货”，不用积极宣传、扩大推销，自会有人找上门来。郑州市百货公司库存盘纸八百多盘，不肯和纸烟厂订立加工合同，反认为“盘纸是公司包销物资，工厂总得向我们买”。
    保守惜售思想不但使资金积压下来，使企业的销货计划不能完成，同时也使有这种思想的干部对市场产生盲目的恐慌心理。这种恐慌心理，又影响到了市场，使许多人对个别供应不足的物资更加觉得不足，本来可以稳定的价格不能稳定，给了奸商以可乘之隙。这种危害是非常严重的。
    为什么这些人面对着大量的货物而保守惜售呢？主要的问题是他们盲目地认为今天的工业品不足，因此对上级指示“大力推销，支持收购，以稳定物价”的精神不能体会，不肯坚决执行。他们并没有调查研究和分析：究竟今天是各种工业品都不足呢？还是只有某些工业品不足？是全国不足呢？还是在个别地方在一定时间内不足？是稍有不足呢还是不足得很多？他们只是在个别地点、个别时间看到某种商品稍见畅销，便认为是整个商品不足，便一方面采取限量出售、停止批发等不适当的措施，一方面向上级大嚷大叫，要求增调。他们以过去稳定物价的方法，来掌握今天的物价。今天国营贸易企业的物资力量是充足的，和市场的需要基本上是相适应的。因此，现在稳定物价最有效的方法，就是把手中的物资大量出售，回笼货币。
    其次，某些干部的“把货存在手里，过些时候卖，可以多赚几个钱”的单纯营利的思想和行为，也造成商品积压。此外，不了解自己的家当、在经营问题上的官僚主义作风，也是积压资金的重要原因。因此，在反对保守惜售的同时，也必须反对单纯营利的资本主义思想和官僚主义作风。
    自中央人民政府贸易部发出坚决克服保守惜售思想的指示后，最近两月来，各地国营贸易企业在经营管理上已经有了一些改善，但今后还应进一步克服保守惜售思想。如何克服呢？一、加强思想教育，扫除以上的思想障碍，使全体干部懂得：只有大力推销，加速资金周转，保证供应，才能刺激生产，和保证物价长期稳定，才能最有效地实现国营贸易企业的增产节约任务。二、各级贸易行政部门和国营贸易企业的领导干部，应当重视和检查计划执行情况的工作，每天应当细看所属各公司当天的进、销、存日报数字，和完成计划数字的百分比，及时了解家底和业务情况，及时研究市场情况的变化，随时改进工作。三、认真检查清点库存，进行商品排队，分别不同商品，研究出不同的出售办法；增设廉价部，推销冷背残货。四、进行价格检查。如某种商品市价高于牌价，而经营这种商品的公司库存充裕，就要坚决积极出售，把市价拉到牌价的水平。五、必须消灭过季商品积压现象。冬季商品必须在冬季卖光（尤其是百货公司），宁可在季尾脱销数日，不应允许再有大批过季的背货积压。六、在经营方式上坚决克服等客上门的现象。必须发动全体职工开展销货竞赛，积极主动地联系各机关、各团体、合作社、商人、小贩等主顾进行销售。并应根据各种不同商品的条件，分别采取组织百货展览会、下乡赶集赶庙会、先联系后送货、扩大宣传等办法，加强和消费者的联系。
