Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 11th: In order to comprehensively unleash the potential of electricity production and better carry out the production increase and savings campaign in the electricity sector, the Electricity Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area electricity production increase and savings joint conference in Tianjin on December 4th. The conference lasted two days. Representatives from the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan Electricity Bureaus, Tianjin private power plants, and other units, totaling eighty people, participated in the conference.

The conference believed that to achieve the goal of fully exploiting the potential of the electricity industry, efforts must be made in the following four aspects: (1) Unify the dispatch of the power system, highly utilize the potential of public and private power generation and supply equipment, and strengthen the safety of power supply. (2) Adjust the unbalanced power load, increasing equipment utilization. (3) Promote rational and economical electricity consumption among users. (4) Further tap the potential of power generation and supply equipment in each electricity bureau. In order to smoothly promote the above work, Zhang Bin, Deputy Director of the Electricity Management Bureau, pointed out that each electricity bureau must, under the leadership of the local government and with the assistance of relevant agencies, conduct extensive publicity and mobilization work to enable power users and cadres and workers of public and private power plants to fully recognize the benefits of unified dispatching for the country and themselves. At the same time, each electricity bureau should establish a reward system for rational and economical electricity consumption, promote advanced experience in this regard, establish service teams, and actively assist users in solving the difficulties encountered in promoting rational and economical electricity consumption.

The conference decided to focus on Tianjin as a pilot for promoting the comprehensive exploitation of potential capacity. The conference adopted plans for unified dispatching of the power system in the Tianjin area, adjusting the power load in Tianjin, and improving the supply of electricity for industrial and commercial use, and put forward specific methods for rational and economical electricity consumption by power users. These methods will be promoted nationwide after gaining experience in Tianjin. In addition, the conference also exchanged experiences in launching production increase and savings competitions among the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan electricity bureaus, and discussed the specific plan of the Tianjin Electricity Bureau to tap the potential of equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 11th: According to the decision of the recently held Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area electricity production increase and savings joint conference, the Tianjin area electricity industry will comprehensively exploit the potential capacity of the industry. The entire city's electricity will be under unified dispatching, and the unbalanced power load will be adjusted. In this way, Tianjin can increase its power by 15,500 kilowatts, equivalent to adding a power plant that would cost 155 billion yuan to build. The utilization rate of power generation equipment in Tianjin can also be increased by 10 percent, and costs can be reduced by 12 percent. As a result of rational and economical electricity consumption by power users throughout the city, 24 million kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved annually, which can meet the needs of 30,000 horsepower of power equipment.

In the Tianjin area, due to the lack of unified dispatching between public and private electricity industries and factory-owned power plants, the power load of power plants cannot be balanced, and users' use of electricity is irrational, resulting in serious waste. There are six factory-owned power plants and one French-owned power plant in Tianjin. Among them, the total maximum load of five plants is only close to half of their power generation capacity. The power load of each power plant under the Tianjin Electricity Administration has reached close to its maximum power generation capacity at its peak, but due to the unbalanced power load, there is still a lot of power waste. Within 24 hours, the difference between the maximum load during lighting hours and the minimum load late at night is 27,000 kilowatts. Within a week, the difference between the average load on weekdays and the average load on Sundays is 10,000 kilowatts.

The irrational use of electricity by users also causes a large amount of waste. For example, among the city's 53 power users, the transformer capacity of 14 households is more than double the actual usage. This is not only overkill but also causes a large consumption of electricity, estimated to consume 216,000 kilowatt-hours per year. Among the city's 53 power users, 84.5 percent of electric motors use only half or less of their power, and more than half of the power is wasted for nothing.

Implementing measures to comprehensively exploit the potential of the electricity industry not only increases production and saves a large amount of wealth for the country but also has good effects in all aspects. For example, after the implementation of unified dispatching of the power system, the power generation and supply equipment of factory-owned power plants and private power plants can be centrally used, which can overcome the waste caused by decentralized power generation and supply by various plants, strengthen the reliability of power supply in various plants, reduce the standby equipment in various plants, and reduce the production costs of various plants. After adjusting the unbalanced weekly and daily loads, the power plant can maintain a balanced load curve and improve equipment utilization.

    京津唐地区电业增产节约联席会议
    制定全面发挥电业潜在能力方案
    以天津为推行重点取得经验向全国推广
    【新华社天津十一日电】中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局为了全面发挥电业生产中的潜在力量，更好地开展电业部门的增产节约运动，十二月四日在天津召开了北京、天津、唐山地区电业增产节约联席会议。这次会议开了两天。参加会议的有中央燃料工业部、北京、天津、唐山电业局、天津私营电厂等单位的代表共八十人。
    会议认为要达到全面发挥电业潜在能力的目的，必须从以下四方面着手：（一）统一电力系统的调度，高度发挥公、私营发电、供电设备的潜在能力，加强供电的安全性。（二）调整高低不平衡的电力负荷，提高设备利用率。（三）在用户中推行合理和节约用电的办法。（四）进一步发挥各电业局发电、供电设备的潜在能力。为了顺利推行上述工作，电业管理总局副局长张彬指出：各电业局必须在地方政府领导和有关机关协助下，进行广泛的宣传、动员工作，使电力用户和公、私营电厂的干部、职工充分认识统一调度工作对国家和他们本身的好处。同时，各电业局应建立奖励合理和节约用电的制度，推广这方面的先进经验，成立服务组，主动地协助用户解决在推行合理和节约用电上所发生的困难。
    这次会议决定以天津为推行全面发挥潜在能力工作的重点。会议通过了天津地区电力系统统一调度、调整天津市电力负荷、改进工商业用电的供应等项方案，并提出了电力用户合理和节约用电的具体办法。这些办法在天津取得经验后将在全国推广。此外，会议并交流了北京、天津、唐山三个电业局展开增产节约竞赛的经验，讨论了天津电业局发挥设备潜在能力的具体计划。
    【新华社天津十一日电】根据最近举行的北京、天津、唐山地区电业增产节约联席会议的决定，天津地区电业将全面发挥电业潜在能力。天津全市电力将统一调度，不平衡的电力负荷将得到调整。这样，天津市可增加一万五千五百瓩的电力，相当于增加一座要花一千五百五十亿元投资建设的发电厂。天津市发电设备利用率也因此可提高百分之十，成本可降低百分之十二。全市电力用户合理和节约用电的结果，一年可节省电二千四百万度，可供三万匹马力动力设备的需要。
    天津地区由于公、私营电业和工厂自备电厂之间没有统一调度，电厂电力负荷不能平衡，用户使用电力不合理，浪费现象十分严重。天津市有六个工厂自备电厂和一个法商电厂，其中五个厂总的最高负荷量仅接近发电能力的一半。天津电业管理局所属各电厂的电力负荷最高时已接近最大的发电能力，但由于电力负荷不平衡，仍有很多电力浪费。一昼夜之内，照明时间的最高负荷和深夜的最低负荷相差两万七千瓩。一周之内，平日平均负荷和星期日平均负荷相差一万瓩。
    用户使用电力的不合理也造成大量浪费。如在全市五十三个电力用户中，有十四户的变压器容量比实际用量多了一倍以上。这不仅是大材小用，而且造成大量电的耗费，估计一年耗电二十一万六千度。全市五十三个电力用户，有百分之八十四点五的电动机只使用一半以下的动力，一半以上电力就白白浪费了。
    实行全面发挥电业潜在能力的办法，不仅为国家增产节约大量财富，而且在各方面都会有良好的效果。如电力系统实行统一调度后，工厂自备电厂和私营电厂的发电、供电设备集中起来统一使用，就能克服各厂分散发电、供电所造成的浪费现象，加强各厂供电的可靠性，减少各厂的备用设备，并降低各厂的生产成本。不平衡的周负荷和日负荷经过调整后，电厂方面就可保持负荷曲线的平衡，提高了设备利用率。
