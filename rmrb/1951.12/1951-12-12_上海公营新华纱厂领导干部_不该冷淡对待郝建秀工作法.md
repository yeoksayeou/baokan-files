Shanghai Public Xin Hua Textile Factory Leaders
Should Not Treat Hao Jianxiu's Work Method Coldly

The leading cadres of the Shanghai Public Xin Hua Textile Factory adopted an "it's none of my business" attitude in promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, failing to provide specific leadership and ideological education, which led the promotion work into a state of chaos.

The Xin Hua Textile Factory started promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method on October 19th. Before that, when the workers saw the report on the Hao Jianxiu work method in the newspaper, their enthusiasm was high. Many workers spontaneously conducted experiments on their own machines based on the experience introduced in the newspaper. At this time, the administrative and trade union leaders adopted a "wait-and-see" attitude, neither studying their learning situation nor planning and arranging promotion work. On October 19th, when the promotion was officially started, the administrative side hastily handed over the entire promotion work to eight employees who had returned from the Hao Jianxiu work method training class. None of the responsible cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, or Communist Youth League participated in the specific leadership work, and they never held a meeting to study the promotion work. The promotion work was carried out without organization or leadership. In addition, no publicity or ideological mobilization was carried out among the workers before the promotion, and the resistant thoughts of some cadres and the masses were not resolved. When the promotion work started, it happened to coincide with changes in the cotton blending composition, coupled with the difficulty in controlling temperature and humidity, the number of yarn breakages increased (about 600 breaks per thousand spindles per hour). The "little teachers" had to take extra care of piecing the broken ends during their demonstrations, so less cleaning work was done. Some workers who originally had conservative ideas became even more suspicious after seeing this. Some said: "Less cleaning work is being done." Others thought: "Hao Jianxiu's work method makes no sense; isn't doing it this way the same as what we do?" During the promotion, some backward workers constantly ridiculed the "little teachers" and the young female workers who were seriously learning: "These young girls want to show off and gain merit; we don't want to learn." Individual workers even attacked the "little teachers," saying: "The 'Number One Man' system was just abolished, and now some 'late masters' have come to manage the workshop!" Even individual cadres with resistant thoughts called the "little teachers" "little Number One Men." The leading cadres, knowing these situations, adopted an "it's none of my business" attitude and did not solve these problems. As a result, the "little teachers" were isolated, unable to fully play their role, and could only mechanically promote the method to "complete the task."

Administrative leaders did not actively find ways to solve problems in the promotion work and even treated these problems with an extremely unserious attitude. The fine yarn female workers sent to the training class were not carefully selected but were pulled in casually. Some equipment that needed to be improved in the promotion work was always met with a dragging attitude from the administrative side, which was unwilling to solve it promptly. For example, the clearer rollers on the machines could not be cleaned, and the small lamb's foot needed to be lowered. The workers repeatedly requested this, but only ten machines have been modified so far (it is estimated that at least forty machines could be modified). The tools that should be added cannot be added in time. For example, only about thirty clearer rollers have been made, and the brooms that should be replaced have not been replaced. Less than a week after the promotion work started, the administrative side transferred the technician Jin Guoqing, who had returned from the training class, from the promotion team to do other work. In order to correctly count the output and clearer roller waste rate, the trade union urged the administrative side to implement the joint instructions issued by the Central Textile Industry Department and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, to implement the system of weighing clearer roller waste and finished yarn. Director Cai said: "Weighing finished yarn is an unscientific and backward method; we can calculate it in our factory using hanks." Although the trade union chairman brought it up six times, it has not been implemented. In order to encourage workers with excellent learning performance, the trade union suggested establishing a reward system. Director Cai also one-sidedly emphasized: "The workers' production enthusiasm should be politically mobilized by the trade union." This suggestion has not yet yielded results.

The trade union committee also lacked understanding of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method. The "little teachers" once requested the trade union leadership, but the trade union did not provide practical and specific assistance. Individual "little teachers" had complacent emotions, and the trade union did not conduct ideological education for them in time to help them correct their shortcomings. During the promotion, the "little teachers" requested the trade union to cooperate in publicity, but Shi Wenbao, who was in charge of cultural and educational work in the trade union, replied: "Want publicity? Bring the materials." (In fact, a lot of materials about the Hao Jianxiu work method have already been introduced in newspapers and magazines.) Therefore, throughout this promotion, the factory never conducted a single publicity campaign.

Currently, the Xin Hua Textile Factory has nominally completed the promotion work in the entire fine yarn workshop, but in reality, the vast majority of workers still operate using the old methods. Many workers do not understand the principles of the Hao Jianxiu work method, so they only follow the Hao Jianxiu work method in front of the "little teachers" and do not follow it behind their backs. The workers said: "In our factory, it's Hao Jianxiu during the day and 'Bai Jianxiu' at night!" Although the factory's clearer roller waste rate once dropped from 1.22 percent to 0.61 percent, it has now increased again to 1.14 percent.

The reason why these problems occurred in the Xin Hua Textile Factory's promotion work, although it is related to the fact that the Shanghai Hao Jianxiu Work Method Promotion Committee did not provide them with timely assistance, and to the complacent emotions of individual "little teachers" in the promotion, is mainly because the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the factory do not pay attention to this work. Although the factory had the central task of democratic unity at that time, democratic unity and promotion work could be combined. The leading cadres of the Xin Hua Textile Factory should first correct their thinking and truly recognize the benefits of the Hao Jianxiu work method; establish a promotion committee with the participation of leading cadres, conduct systematic publicity and education among the masses, and use detailed accounting and vivid examples to make the workers understand that learning the Hao Jianxiu work method is a practical and effective way to realize Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice thrift." The administration should also guarantee that the promotion work is not subject to technical obstacles. The trade union committee should regard the promotion work as the main content of the trade union facing production, and on the basis of relying on and mobilizing the masses, create a upsurge of learning the Hao Jianxiu work method.

    上海公营新华纱厂领导干部
    不该冷淡对待郝建秀工作法
    上海公营新华纱厂的领导干部在推广郝建秀工作法中抱“事不关己”的态度，不进行具体领导和思想教育，使推广工作陷入混乱状态。
    新华纱厂推广郝建秀工作法的工作是十月十九日开始的。在这以前，工人们看到报纸上发表了郝建秀工作法时，情绪很高。许多工人都自发地根据报上介绍的经验，在自己车上进行试验。这时候行政和工会的领导干部抱着“冷眼旁观”的态度，既不研究他们的学习情况，也不计划、布置推广工作。十月十九日正式开始推广，行政方面草率地把整个推广工作交给参加郝建秀工作法学习班学习回来的八个职工去搞。党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部一个也没有参加具体的领导工作，并且从没有开过一次会研究推广工作。推广工作就在无组织无领导的情况下进行。加以推广前没有向工人群众进行过宣传和思想动员，部分干部和群众对郝建秀工作法的抗拒思想就没得解决。推广工作开始时，恰好碰上配花成份改变，加以温度湿度掌握困难，断头较前增多（每千锭每小时约断头六百个）。小先生表演时要多照顾接头，因此清洁工作做得较少。一些原来就有保守思想的工人看了之后，更加怀疑起来了。有的人说：“清洁工作做得少。”也有的人认为：“郝建秀工作法没有道理，这样做还不是和我们一样。”在推广中，部分落后工人不断讽刺小先生和认真学习的青年女工：“这是小姑娘要出风头、得功劳，我们是不要学。”个别工人还打击小先生说：“拿摩温制度刚取消，车弄里又出晚爷晚娘来管啦！”甚至个别有抗拒思想的干部也说小先生是“小拿摩温”。领导干部知道了这些情况后，却抱着“事不关己”的态度，不去解决这些问题。结果，小先生陷于孤立，不能充分发挥作用，就只能机械地为“完成任务”而推广。
    行政领导干部不积极设法解决推广工作中的问题，甚至以极不严肃的态度对待这些问题。派到学习班学习的细纱女工，就不是慎重选拔出来，而是随便拉了去的。推广工作中需要改进的某些设备，行政方面总抱着拖拉态度不肯及时解决。比如，车子擦板不能打，需要把小羊脚放低。工人曾一再提出要求，到现在只改了十部（估计至少可改好四十部）。应该添置的工具也不能及时添置，比如，擦板只做了三十块左右，应换的扫帚也没有换。推广工作开始还没有到一个星期，行政方面就把学习回来的技术员金国庆从推广组里抽调出去做其他工作。为正确统计产量和皮辊花率，工会曾催促行政方面实行中央纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会所发的联合指示，实行皮辊花和成纱过磅的制度。蔡厂长却说：“成纱过磅是不科学的、落后的办法；我们厂里有亨司可以计算。”虽经工会主席提过六次，但一直没有实行。为了鼓励学习成绩优良的工人，工会建议建立奖励制度。蔡厂长也片面地强调：“工人的生产热情，是要靠工会从政治上鼓动的。”这个建议到现在还没有得到结果。
    工会委员会对推推郝建秀工作法也是认识不够的。小先生曾经请求工会领导，工会没有给予切实和具体的帮助。个别小先生有自满情绪，工会也没有及时对他们进行思想教育，帮助他们纠正缺点。在推广中小先生要求工会配合进行宣传，工会负责文教工作的史文宝却回答说：“要宣传？拿材料来。”（事实上关于郝建秀工作法的材料，报纸、刊物上已经介绍了很多。）因此，在这次推广中，厂里自始至终就没有搞过一次宣传。
    目前，新华纱厂在名义上是已经完成了全细纱车间的推广工作，实际上绝大部分工人还是用老办法操作。不少工人因为不懂得郝建秀工作法的道理，所以只是当着小先生面才照郝建秀工作法做，背后就不照做。工人们说：“我们厂里日里是郝建秀，夜里是‘白建秀’！”厂里的皮辊花率虽曾一度从百分之一点二二降低到百分之零点六一，但是现在已经又增加到百分之一点一四。
    新华纱厂的推广工作所以发生这些问题，虽然和上海市郝建秀工作法推广委员会对他们的帮助不够及时，以及个别小先生在推广中的自满情绪有关，但主要是因为厂里的党委、行政、工会、青年团不重视这个工作。虽然当时厂里有民主团结的中心任务，但是，民主团结和推广工作是可以结合起来进行的。新华纱厂的领导干部应该首先端正思想，真正认识郝建秀工作法的好处；建立有领导干部参加的推广委员会，向群众进行有系统的宣传教育，以算细账的方式和生动的实例，使工人群众认识到学习郝建秀工作法是实现毛主席号召的“增加生产，厉行节约”的切实有效的方法。行政方面并应保证使推广工作不受技术上的障碍。工会委员会应把推广工作作为工会面向生产的主要内容，在依靠和发动群众的基础上，造成学习郝建秀工作法的热潮。
