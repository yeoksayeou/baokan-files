Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 11th: TASS, Moscow, December 10th: *Pravda's* international affairs observer, Marinin, analyzed the current economic situation in the United States in an international commentary. He wrote: Some American economists have long talked about the "strange phenomenon" of the American economy. They believe that the characteristic of this so-called "strange phenomenon" is that "the increase in the industrial operating rate has instead caused a crisis of consumption." However, there is nothing strange about this. This is a very natural result of the unlimited expansion of armaments and the increasing reduction of civilian industry.

According to materials from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the output of durable consumer goods fell by nearly 40 percent in the second and third quarters of this year. The production of cotton textiles, wool textiles, and footwear has also been greatly reduced. Official documents admit that there is a "large surplus of labor" in major industrial areas.

For example, in Detroit, the unemployed army has exceeded 100,000 people. In the New England states, the center of the American textile industry, cotton and woolen mills have recently laid off approximately 50,000 workers. In New York State, nearly 70,000 women's clothing workers have been dismissed. If we take a look at the situation where the national textile industry and several other industries have shortened their weekly working hours, we can clearly see that, in addition to the fully unemployed workers, there are many more partially unemployed workers.

What particularly disturbs Wall Street economists is the fact that even in the case of reduced production of mass consumer goods, demand is still falling sharply. However, this only clearly confirms that the war economy and the resulting runaway inflation, the constant rise in prices, and unprecedented heavy taxes have greatly reduced the living standards of the masses of the people.

Exploiting the broad masses is the means to maintain the American war economy and enable American monopoly capitalists to seek unbelievable super-profits. The plan of the Wall Street giants is to launch a new and more violent offensive against the living standards of the working people in the near future.

Therefore, the prospect facing the American economy is that the declining effective demand of the broad strata of the American people will cause a more serious "consumption crisis."

Marinin said: In 1951, there were strike struggles by railway workers, textile workers, miners, aircraft and automobile workers, and dockworkers, not to mention the hundreds of other strikes that have been or are being held in many major cities in the United States. According to newspaper reports, the government's Price Stabilization Bureau is under increasing pressure from many unions demanding wage increases. For example, in mid-November, even the reactionary leadership of the Steelworkers Union had to propose a large increase in the wages of 600,000 steelworkers. The strike struggle is growing more and more and becoming more and more stubborn.

Marinin concluded by saying: The intense expansion of armaments can only be carried out by reducing the production of consumer goods and lowering the purchasing power of the people. All of these make America's economic difficulties and contradictions more acute, and all of these will only lead to greater chaos and collapse.

    真理报评美国经济危机
    扩军运动降低了人民的购买力
    使美国经济矛盾更加厉害
   【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：“真理报”国际问题观察家马里宁在国际述评中分析了美国目前的经济情况。他写道：某些美国经济学家老早就曾谈论到美国经济的“奇怪现象”。他们认为这种所谓“奇怪现象”的特征就是“工业开工率的增加反而引起了消费的危机。”但是，这并没有什么奇怪的地方，这是无限制地扩张军备和日甚一日地削减民用工业的十分自然的结果。
    根据美国联邦准备局的材料，在今年第二和第三两季内，耐用消费品的产量几乎减少了百分之四十。棉织业、毛织业和制鞋业的生产也大为减少。官方文件承认：在大工业区内，有着“大量的剩余劳动力”。
    例如，在底特律，失业军已超过十万人。在美国的纺织业中心，新英格兰各州，各棉、毛纺织厂最近约解雇了五万名工人。在纽约州，将近七万名女装工人被辞退了。如果我们再看一看全国纺织业和若干其他工业已经缩短每周工作时间的情形，就可以清楚地看出，在完全失业的工人以外，还有很多半失业的工人。
    使华尔街的经济学家特别感到不安的是下面的事实：甚至在大众消费品生产已经削减的情况下，需求仍然是急剧下降。但是，这不过明显地证实了，战争经济和它所带来的疯狂的通货膨胀，物价的不断上涨和空前未有的重税，已使人民大众的生活水准大大下降。
    掠夺广大群众是维持美国战争经济和使美国垄断资本家能够谋取难以置信的超额利润的手段。华尔街巨头们的计划是在最近的将来对劳动人民大众的生活水准发动新的、更猛烈的攻势。
    因此，美国经济所面临的前景就是，美国广大阶层人民的有效需求日益下降将引起更严重的“消费危机”。
    马里宁说：一九五一年发生了铁路工人、纺织工人、矿工、飞机和汽车工人、码头工人的罢工斗争，还不提已在或正在美国许多大城市举行的另外数百起的罢工。据报纸报道，政府的物价稳定局受到许多要求增加工资的工会逐渐增大的压力。例如，在十一月中旬，连钢铁工人工会的反动领导机构也不得不提出大大增加六十万钢铁工人的工资的要求。罢工斗争正在越来越增长起来，并且越来越顽强。
    马里宁最后说：紧张的扩张军备运动之所以能够进行，是由于削减了消费品的生产，降低了人民的购买力，所有这些都使得美国的经济困难和矛盾更加厉害，所有这些只会引起更大的混乱和崩溃。
