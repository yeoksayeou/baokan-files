    Guanzhong Area of Shaanxi Province
    More Than 50,000 Wells Dug This Year
    Guaranteeing a Bumper Harvest on 360,000 Mu of Cotton Fields
    This year, the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province (including the six special districts of Weinan, Xianyang, Baoji, Yulin, Shangluo, and Nanzheng) launched a mass well-digging campaign, digging and repairing a total of 51,698 new and old wells, saving 361,886 mu of cotton fields from drought and ensuring a bumper cotton harvest (with a minimum increase of 15 *jin* of ginned cotton per mu).
    This well-digging campaign began in July of this year. At that time, there was a drought with no rain. In order to ensure a bumper cotton harvest, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government established "Cotton Field Bumper Harvest Drought Prevention Committees" in leadership organs at all levels in the Guanzhong area in June of this year. It then loaned 30 billion yuan allocated by the Central People's Government to the peasants, and systematically led the peasants to carry out the well-digging campaign, which was successfully completed by the end of August. The Guanzhong area has always suffered from drought, and the People's Government's leadership in digging wells completely met the needs of the local peasants. In addition to completing the assigned task of 3,000 wells, the peasants in Chang'an County voluntarily dug 3,055 wells, so that most of the county's cotton fields were not affected by the drought. After the well-digging campaign in Gaoling County, there were more than 10,000 new and old wells dug and repaired throughout the county, so that the vast majority of the county's 152,000 mu of cotton fields could be irrigated. The previously so-called "Hanmai Zhang, Qian Niuwang (both village names), Xinglongzhuang where rain is never seen" have all become irrigated areas.
    The reasons for the great success of this well-digging campaign, in addition to the emphasis placed on the leadership of well-digging work by governments at all levels, were mainly that the wisdom of the masses of peasants was fully utilized and various well-digging methods were created. For example, at the beginning of the movement, there were difficulties in obtaining bricks for well construction in various places, but cadres at all levels and peasants actively came up with various methods to overcome these difficulties. Li Keliang, a peasant in Maweigao Village, Sanyuan County, created a method of hooping wells with willow wood cylinders, which not only solved the difficulty of the lack of bricks, but also overcame the difficulty of underground quicksand layers. In addition, methods of hooping wells with wooden boards or planting wooden stakes at the bottom of the wells were also created, which saved labor and money, and solved the current difficulty of farmers having little capital for well-digging. In addition, different well-digging methods were adopted according to different regions. In areas with high groundwater levels, the focus was on restoring and improving the irrigation efficiency of old wells; in areas with better soil quality, the method of watering the land first and then hooping the wells was adopted in order to irrigate the cotton fields in time to avoid drought. In addition to digging wells, methods such as digging ponds, excavating springs, and hooping water cellars were also carried out to solve the urgent need for water for farmers in times of drought.

### 陕西省关中地区  今年打井五万多眼  保证三十六万亩棉田丰收

    陕西省关中地区
    今年打井五万多眼
    保证三十六万亩棉田丰收
    陕西省关中地区（包括渭南、咸阳、宝鸡、榆林、商雒、南郑等六个专区），今年开展了群众性的打井运动，共打修新旧水井五万一千六百九十八眼，使三十六万一千八百八十六亩棉田免除了旱灾，保证了棉花的丰收（每亩棉田最低可增产皮棉十五市斤）。
    这个打井运动是在今年七月开始的。当时天旱不雨，陕西省人民政府为保证棉田丰产，今年六月就在关中地区各级领导机关成立了“棉田丰产防旱委员会”，以中央人民政府所拨的三百亿元贷款贷放给农民，并有计划地领导农民开展打井运动，到八月底就胜利地完成了打井任务。关中区一向苦旱，人民政府领导打井，是完全符合当地农民要求的。长安县农民除完成分配给的三千眼井的任务外，还自动打了三千零五十五眼井，使全县大部棉田没有受干旱的影响；高陵县经过打井运动后，全县打修新旧水井就有一万多眼，使全县十五万二千多亩棉田，绝大部分可以用水灌溉。以前所谓“旱麦张，乾牛王（都是村名），不见雨的兴隆庄”，也都变成了水利区。
    这次打井运动有这样大的成绩的原因，除各级人民政府重视打井领导工作外，主要的是充分发挥了农民群众的智慧，创造了各种打井办法。像运动开始时，各地曾发生了砌井用砖的困难，但各级干部和农民积极想出各种办法，克服了这些困难。三原县马尾高村农民李克亮创造了用柳木筒箍井的办法，不仅解决了缺砖的困难，还克服了地下流沙层的困难。另外还创造了用木板或在井底栽木桩的办法箍井，省工省钱，解决了目前农民打井资金少的困难。此外，按照不同地区采取了不同的打井办法。遇到地下水位高的地区，就以恢复和发挥旧水井的灌溉效率为主；在土质较好的地区，就采取先浇地后箍井的办法，以便及时浇灌棉田免除旱灾。除打井外，同时还进行了挖塘、刨泉、箍水窖等办法，以解决天旱农民迫切需水的困难。　（吴静芳）
