Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 27th. This correspondent reports: Today is December 27th, a day when peace-loving people all over the world had hoped to see the end of the Korean armistice negotiations. However, due to the U.S. side's continued adoption of abominable delaying tactics, insisting on unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs, and continuing to engage in slander and extortion on the issue of prisoner arrangements, the end of the armistice negotiations remains distant.

As everyone knows, for the past month, in addition to various delays in the specific arrangements for the armistice, the U.S. side has also created a vicious conspiracy to obstruct on the prisoner of war issue. This conspiracy began with a statement made by Hanley, Chief of the Military Law Department of the U.S. Eighth Army, on November 14, regarding so-called "atrocities against American prisoners of war." Subsequently, various political representatives, newspapers, and news agencies of the American bourgeoisie have clamored extensively to provide "public opinion support" for the U.S. negotiating representatives' insistence on unreasonable demands at the conference table, and attempted to use a flood of lies to cover up their refusal to agree to the rapid exchange of all prisoners of war.

In order to conceal its defeats, in the past, the U.S. side consistently greatly reduced the number of U.S. military casualties and prisoners of war, and listed many U.S. soldiers killed on the battlefield as vaguely "missing." For example, the U.S. Department of Defense, in its communique issued on September 12, only admitted that 169 U.S. soldiers had been captured. As another example, on November 20, U.S. Pacific Marine Corps Commander Shepherd boasted: "Our Marine Corps will not allow itself to be captured. Since January 1, only fourteen Marine Corps personnel have been reported missing in action. The Marine Corps simply does not surrender." However, for another propaganda purpose, the U.S. side is now trying to count all the personnel it declared as "missing" as prisoners of war. They say that the U.S. side announced that more than 12,000 people are "missing," while the Korean-Chinese side's list of American prisoners of war "only" has more than 3,000 people. Therefore, the remaining people were abused and killed by the Korean-Chinese side (Hanley said it was 5,500, and Ridgway, two days earlier than Hanley, said it was 8,000). The U.S. propaganda's sudden change of tune was originally intended to incite public opinion for extortion.

However, this U.S. tactic is so clumsy, its slanderous materials are so crudely fabricated, and its steps are so chaotic, that even the American bourgeoisie's own rhetoric has criticized it. "Time" magazine, the mouthpiece of American big business, commented on the contradictory figures of the so-called "atrocities" with the headline "The Four-Star's (referring to Ridgway) Error" in its news column on December 3, saying: "Ridgway proved to be an even bigger exaggerator than Hanley." The magazine said: "Errors in the atrocities figures mean painful anxiety for the wives and parents of Americans captured or missing in action. Ridgway's staff handles these figures as carelessly and casually as Hanley." Therefore, the magazine pointed out that the public simply does not believe these fabrications.

In fact, the Korean-Chinese People's Forces' revolutionary humanitarian policy of leniency towards prisoners of war cannot be distorted by base rumors. The U.S. side's prohibition of journalists from approaching released American prisoners of war, and the dispatch of senior military officers to monitor these American soldiers who have gained freedom from the Korean-Chinese side, preventing officers and soldiers from divulging information about the Korean-Chinese side's release of prisoners of war, all prove that the U.S. government is very afraid that the American people and soldiers will know the truth. However, anyone who has a slight respect for objective facts cannot but admit the humanity and generosity of the Korean-Chinese forces in treating prisoners of war. For example, Martin, a reporter for the American "Saturday Evening Post," based on the accounts of prisoners of war, reported in detail how a group of American officers and soldiers were captured, how they were treated leniently after being captured, and how they were later released. This magazine and this reporter can by no means be suspected of engaging in "Communist propaganda." Even now, despite the U.S. side's major dissemination of the lie of so-called "atrocities," according to the United Press, U.S. officers in Korea still have to privately admit that "Chinese forces do not kill prisoners of war."

Regardless of all these facts, the U.S. side is currently playing a very shameless conspiracy on the prisoner of war issue. They count those who have already died in battle as "missing" persons, and then count the "missing" persons as those captured by our side. Their basis is the U.S. Department of Defense's communique. However, the fundamental unreliability of this communique is very obvious. Because even the Americans themselves have exposed the lie that this communique is accustomed to counting corpses that could not be dragged back as "missing" persons. If you don't believe it, please see the December 7 issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine. This magazine said that in the so-called "missing" list announced by the Department of Defense, "many are soldiers who died or were seriously injured in the retreat in the early stages of the war, and when they were left behind, they were listed as missing." The magazine also cited an example, saying that during the great defeat of the American invading army last winter, "several divisions of troops were cut off, and all casualties were listed as 'missing.'"

Not only that, but countless American prisoners of war who have been released by the Korean-Chinese People's Forces on the front lines, indeed many of them have truly disappeared under the special care of the American military. The American "National Guardian Weekly" on November 14 accused the U.S. government of this criminal act, pointing out that a soldier named Maher, originally from the medical team of the 8th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the American invading army, disappeared after being transported by plane to Japan by the U.S. military authorities after being released by our side. The "National Guardian Weekly" also pointed out that the nineteen soldiers of the 1st Marine Division who were released in July of this year were also "missing" in the same way.

From the U.S. side's lying propaganda on the issue of exchanging prisoners, which is so fickle and so full of contradictions, it is not difficult for people to see clearly once again the ugly face of the U.S. deliberately prolonging the armistice negotiations indefinitely. Therefore, the responsibility for the failure of the two sides to reach an armistice agreement within the thirty-day period, the responsibility for the failure of the prisoners of war on both sides to return home quickly, and the responsibility for the long-term anxiety of their thousands of families must be borne entirely by the U.S. side. Correction: The seventh paragraph (ie, the first paragraph of the fourth column) of "Comrade Mao Zedong on Opposing Corruption and Waste" on the first page of this newspaper on the 21st should be after the fourth paragraph of the full text.

    新华社记者斥美方关于俘虏问题的谎言
    美方在俘虏问题上的宣传反复无常矛盾百出暴露美方故意无限期拖延停战谈判的丑恶面目
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社记者报道：今天是十二月二十七日，原是全世界爱好和平的人民所期望的结束朝鲜停战谈判的一天，然而，由于美方继续采取可恶的拖延政策，坚持干涉我方内政的无理要求，并在俘虏的安排问题上继续进行诽谤和勒索，致使停战谈判的结束仍遥遥无期。
    大家知道，一个月以来，美方除在停战的具体安排问题上多方进行拖延外，还在俘虏问题上制造了恶毒的阻挠阴谋。这一阴谋是以美国第八军军法处长汉莱十一月十四日发表的所谓“对美军俘虏的暴行”的声明开始的。其后，美国资产阶级的各种政治代表、报刊、通讯社曾大肆叫嚣，为美方谈判代表在会议席上坚持无理要求的行为提供“舆论的支持”，并企图用谎言的洪流来掩护他们拒绝同意迅速交换全部俘虏的行动。
    为了掩饰自己的败绩，在过去，美方曾一贯地大大缩小了美军的伤亡和被俘的数字，并把许多在战场上被击毙的美军列入含糊的“失踪”之列。例如，美国国防部在它九月十二日发表的公报里，只承认有一百六十九名美军被俘。又如，在十一月二十日，美国太平洋海军陆战队司令谢培德也曾吹牛说：“我们海军陆战队不会让人家俘虏。自从一月一日以来，据报只有十四名海军陆战队人员在作战中失踪。海军陆战队是根本不投降的。”但是，为了另一个宣传目的，美方现在却力图把自己宣布为“失踪”的人员全数统统算成俘虏。他们说，美方宣布“失踪”的有一万二千多人，而朝中方面提出的美军战俘名单“只有”三千多，因此，剩下的人就是被朝中方面虐杀了（汉莱说是五千五，李奇微比汉莱还早两天说是八千）。美方宣传的忽然走调，原是想借此煽动舆论以进行敲诈的。
    但是，美方的这一手法是如此拙劣，它的诽谤材料是如此粗制滥造，它的步调是如此混乱，甚至美国资产阶级的言论也加以非难。美国大企业的喉舌“时代”杂志于十二月三日在它的新闻专栏中，以“四星（按指李奇微）的错误”为题评论美方前后矛盾的关于所谓“暴行”的数字说：“李奇微证明是比汉莱还要大的夸大者”。这个杂志说：“暴行数字上的错误，对于在作战中被俘或失踪的美国人的妻子和双亲来说，意味着痛苦的焦虑。李奇微的人员处理这种数字，其马虎和随便，一如汉莱。”因此，这个杂志指出，公众根本不相信这些虚构。
    其实朝中人民部队对俘虏实行革命人道主义的宽待政策，绝不是低劣的造谣所能歪曲得了的。美方禁止记者接近被释放的美军俘虏，还派了高级军官把这些从朝中方面获得自由的美军士兵监视起来，不许官兵泄露有关朝中方面释放俘虏的消息，都证明美国政府非常害怕美国人民和士兵知道真相。但是，只要稍许尊重客观事实的人，都不能不承认朝中部队对待俘虏的人道和宽大。例如，美国“星期六晚邮报”的记者马丁就曾根据俘虏们的口述，详细地报道过一批美军官兵如何被俘、被俘后如何受到宽待以及后来获释的情形。这个杂志以及这位记者都决不能被怀疑是从事“共产党宣传”的。即使是现在，尽管美方大事散布所谓“暴行”的谎言，但据合众社透露，美方在朝鲜的军官私下仍不得不承认“中国部队不杀害俘虏”。
    不顾所有这些事实，目前美方仍在俘虏问题上玩弄着一个十分无耻的阴谋。它们把已经战死的人算作“失踪”的人，再把“失踪”的人算作被我方俘掳的人。它们的根据就是美国国防部的公报。然而，这个公报的根本不足为凭是十分显然的。因为，甚至连美国人自己也曾揭穿过，这个公报惯于把来不及拖回去的尸体都算作“失踪”的人的谎言。不信请看十二月七日的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志。这本杂志说，在国防部公布的所谓“失踪”名单中，“很多是在战争初期的退却中战死或受重伤的士兵，当他们被遗留在后面时，便被列为失踪的人”。这个杂志还举出实例说：在去冬美国侵略军的大溃败中，“好几个师的部队曾被截断，所有的伤亡都被列为‘失踪’”。
    不仅如此，无数已被朝中人民部队在前线释放的美国俘虏，其中确有不少的人在美国军方的特别照顾下真正的失踪了。美国的“国民前卫周刊”在十一月十四日曾经控诉美国政府的这种罪恶行为，指出有一个名叫美赫的原属美国侵略军第一骑兵师第八团医疗队的士兵，在被我方释放之后，经美军当局用飞机载往日本之后，就没有下落了。“国民前卫周刊”同时指出，同样“失踪”的还有在今年七月获释的十九名美军海军陆战队第一师的士兵。
    从美方在交换俘虏问题上所进行的如此反复无常如此矛盾百出的撒谎宣传中，人们不难再一次清楚地看出美方故意无限期拖延停战谈判的丑恶面目。因此，使双方在三十天期限内不能达成停战协议的责任，使双方战俘不能迅速回家以及他们的万千家属长期悬望的痛苦不能迅速消除的责任，必须由美方全部担负。更正二十一日本报一版“毛泽东同志论反对贪污浪费”第七段（即第四栏第一段）应在全文第四段之后。
