The People's Publishing House has recently published a new edition of Comrade Hu Qiaomu's book "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China." The new edition contains some revisions to the first edition, so the length has increased by seventeen pages. Most of the revisions made in the new edition are textual. There is one important correction: In the first edition, on page 25, line 3, the phrase "protecting rich peasants," judging from the context above, "protecting" is clearly a misprint of "preserving." In the new edition, on page 30, this sentence has been corrected to "restricting rich peasants."

In addition to textual revisions, there are also several important supplements and corrections to historical facts. For example, the narrative about the May Fourth Movement was relatively brief in the first edition. In the new edition, on pages 5 to 6, the author added the following: "During the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the Chinese working class began to demonstrate its strength and began to accept the influence of Marxism-Leninism. Workers in Shanghai, Tangshan, Changxindian, and other places participated in the national people's anti-imperialist struggle with the first political strikes in Chinese history, helping the struggle to achieve rapid victory. The rise of the Chinese working class promoted the left wing of the Chinese intellectuals in the May Fourth Movement, prompting them to resolve to carry out revolutionary work among the workers. The slogans of the May Fourth Movement in the cultural sphere were to demand democracy and science, but the left wing of the May Fourth Movement, influenced by the Russian October Revolution and possessing preliminary communist ideas, revolutionary intellectuals, propagated the view that China must realize socialism and that the Chinese revolution must be guided by Marxism-Leninism. Holding such views, they carried out propaganda and organizational work among the workers, enabling the Chinese workers' movement and the Chinese revolutionary movement to enter a new period."

On page 26 of the new edition, the following supplement was made to the narrative on page 21 of the first edition regarding the continued organization of uprisings by the Communist Party of China in various places after the Autumn Harvest Uprising: "...In addition, from the autumn and winter of 1927 to the spring of 1928, the Party also organized uprisings in eastern Hubei, eastern Hunan, southern Hunan, Guangzhou, eastern Guangdong, Hainan Island, and other places. Among them, the uprising in southern Hunan was led by Comrades Zhu De, Chen Yi, Lin Biao, and others; after leading a part of the troops who had survived the Nanchang Uprising's defeat in Guangdong, they transferred to southern Hunan, and shortly after leading the local uprising, they led the troops and the peasant army organized in the uprising to join forces with Comrade Mao Zedong's troops. A portion of the armed forces organized in the uprisings in other places were also somewhat preserved. Wherever the correct leadership was implemented for this portion of the armed forces, the revolutionary armed struggle there gradually developed. From then on, the Second Revolutionary Civil War began. These troops were the initial source of the later Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, i.e., the current Chinese People's Liberation Army."

On pages 34 to 35 of the new edition, supplements and corrections were also made to the narrative on page 28 of the first edition regarding the "Left" leaning line: "From June to September 1930 (the first edition said October), the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Li Lisan, once demanded the organization of a general uprising in the central cities nationwide and a general offensive towards the central cities by the national Red Army. This erroneous plan caused serious losses to the Party's secret organizations in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. However, in the Red Army, due to Comrade Mao Zedong's adherence to the correct policy, no major impact occurred. In September 1930, Comrade Li Lisan's mistakes were corrected by the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party. But in January 1931, a new 'Left' leaning faction characterized by dogmatism, headed by Comrades Wang Ming (Chen Shaoyu) and Bogu (Qin Bangxian), again used the guise of Marxism-Leninism to attack the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee from the 'Left.' They believed that Comrade Li Lisan's main mistake and the main danger within the Chinese Communist Party at that time was right-leaning rather than 'Left'-leaning, and they blamed the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party for 'not exposing and attacking in the slightest the consistent right-leaning opportunist theory and practice of the Li Lisan line.' They finally obtained the leadership of the Central Committee through the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party. The new 'Left' leaning faction, headed by Wang Ming and Bogu, completely denied the significant changes in domestic politics caused by the Japanese invasion, and believed that all factions and intermediate factions of the Kuomintang were equally counter-revolutionary, demanding that the Party wage a 'fight to the death' against them across the board. On the issue of the Red Army's warfare, this 'Left' leaning faction opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas on guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, continuing to demand that the Red Army seize the central cities; and on the issue of secret work in the Kuomintang areas, they opposed Comrade Liu Shaoqi's ideas on utilizing legal forms and accumulating revolutionary strength, continuing to implement an adventurous policy divorced from the majority of the masses. Under this erroneous leadership, although the Party's organization in the Kuomintang-controlled areas carried out many heroic struggles in a severe environment, it was almost completely destroyed in the end, and the provisional central committee organized by the 'Left' leaning elements had to move to the Central Red Army base area in 1933. After the provisional central committee arrived at the Red Army base area, although it had joined with Central Committee members such as Comrade Mao Zedong who were working in the Red Army and the revolutionary base areas to form a formal central organ, it pushed aside Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership over the Red Army."

The new edition also corrected individual historical facts in the first edition. For example, "Shaanxi-Gansu Red Army" on page 29 of the first edition has been corrected to "Northern Shaanxi Red Army" in the new edition (see page 36).

Another important change in the new edition is the deletion of the word "Period" from the titles of the first to fourth chapters. This is because the book narrates the history of the Communist Party of China over thirty years in four sections, divided into six periods. The first and fourth chapters each contain two periods: the first chapter contains the founding period of the Party and the period of the First Revolutionary Civil War (originally titled "The Founding of the Party and the Period of the First Revolutionary Civil War"), and the fourth chapter contains the period of the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the period of economic recovery (original title same). However, readers often mistakenly believe that each of these two chapters only contains one period, and the division and name of the last period (the founding of the People's Republic of China and the period of economic recovery) are not yet convenient to determine, so deleting the word "Period" is appropriate.

This book has made a good attempt at narrating the thirty-year history of the Communist Party of China. The textual revisions and supplements to some historical facts made in the new edition compared to the first edition can give readers a clearer understanding. However, the People's Publishing House left a small oversight in the work of publishing this book, that is, the author called the new edition a "Second Edition" (see "Statement for the Second Edition"), while the People's Publishing House noted it as "Re-typeset Third Edition" on the copyright page. Is it a "Second Edition" or a "Third Edition"? It is confusing. This oversight should be corrected in the next printing.

### 介绍“中国共产党的三十年”的新版本

    介绍“中国共产党的三十年”的新版本
    人民出版社最近出版了胡乔木同志所著“中国共产党的三十年”一书的新版本。新版本包含一些对于初版的修正，所以篇幅较初版本增加了十七页。新版本所作的修正大部分是文字上的。有一处是重要的订正：初版本第二十五页第三行“保护富农”一语，从上文看来，“保护”显然是“保存”的印误。在新版本第三十页上，这句话已改正为“限制富农”。
    除了文字上的修正以外，也有几处历史事实的重要补充和订正。比如关于“五四”运动的叙述，初版本是较为简略的。作者在新版本第五至第六页作了如下的补充：“在一九一九年的‘五四’运动中，中国工人阶级开始表现出自己的力量，并且开始接受马克思列宁主义的影响。上海、唐山、长辛店等地的工人，以中国历史上第一次的政治罢工参加了全国人民的反帝国主义斗争，帮助斗争迅速地得到了胜利。中国工人力量的兴起，推动了‘五四’运动中的中国知识分子的左翼，使他们决心在工人中间进行革命工作。‘五四’运动在文化方面的口号，是要求民主和科学，但是‘五四’运动中的左翼，因受俄国十月革命的影响而具有初步的共产主义思想的革命知识分子，却传布了中国必须实现社会主义的观点，传布了必须用马克思列宁主义来指导中国革命的观点。他们抱着这样的观点在工人中间进行宣传工作和组织工作，使得中国工人运动和中国革命运动进入了一个新的时期。”
    新版本第二十六页对初版本第二十一页关于秋收起义以后中国共产党继续在各地组织起义的叙述作了如下的补充：“……此外，在一九二七年秋冬到一九二八年春，党还在湖北东部、湖南东部、湖南南部、广州市、广东东部、海南岛以及其他地方组织了起义。其中湖南南部的起义，是朱德、陈毅、林彪等同志领导的；他们率领南昌起义的部队在广东失败后保留的一部分转入湖南南部，在领导当地起义后不久，又率领部队和起义中组织的农军与毛泽东同志的部队会合。其他地方的起义中组织起来的武装部队，也多少留下了一部分。凡是对这一部分武装部队实行了正确领导的地方，那里的革命武装斗争就逐步地发展了起来。从此，就开始了第二次国内革命战争。这些部队，就是后来的中国工农红军即现时的中国人民解放军的最初的来源。”
    新版本第三十四至三十五页对初版本第二十八页关于“左”倾路线的叙述也作了补充和订正：“一九三○年六月至九月（初版本作十月）间，党中央以李立三同志为首，曾经要求组织全国中心城市的总起义和全国红军向中心城市的总进攻。这个错误计划曾经造成国民党统治区党的秘密组织的严重损失。但是在红军中，却由于毛泽东同志坚持着正确的方针，没有发生大的影响。一九三○年九月，李立三同志的错误受到了党的六届三中全会的纠正。但在一九三一年一月，以王明（陈绍禹）、博古（秦邦宪）两同志为首的以教条主义为特征的一个新的‘左’倾派别，又利用马克思列宁主义的外衣，从‘左’面来攻击六届三中全会。他们认为李立三同志的主要错误和当时中国共产党内的主要危险，是右倾而不是“左”倾，并且责备党的六届三中全会‘对于立三路线的一贯右倾机会主义的理论与实际，未加以丝毫的揭破和打击。’他们终于经过党的六届四中全会而取得了中央的领导地位。以王明、博古为首的新的‘左’倾派别，完全否认由日本侵略所引起的国内政治的重大变化，而认为国民党各派和各中间派别都是一样的反革命，要求党向他们一律进行‘决死斗争’。这个‘左’倾派在红军战争的问题上反对毛泽东同志关于游击战运动战的思想，继续要求红军夺取中心城市；又在国民党区秘密工作的问题上，反对刘少奇同志所坚持的关于利用合法形式和积蓄革命力量的思想，继续实行脱离多数群众的冒险政策。在这个错误的领导下，党在国民党统治区的组织虽然在严重环境下作过许多英勇的斗争，最后却差不多全部受到了破坏，而由‘左’倾分子所组织的临时中央，在一九三三年也不得不迁入中央红军根据地。临时中央到达红军根据地后，虽然已与在红军和革命根据地工作的中央委员毛泽东同志等会合，组成了正式的中央机关，但是排挤了毛泽东同志的领导，特别是排挤了毛泽东同志对于红军的领导。”
    新版本也对初版本个别历史事实作了订正。如初版本第二十九页“陕甘红军”，新版本已订正为“陕北红军”（见第三十六页）。
    新版本的另一个重要的改变就是把第一至第四各章题目上的“时期”字样删去了。因为这本书是把中国共产党三十年来六个时期的历史分作四个段落来叙述的。第一章和第四章各包含两个时期：第一章包含党的成立时期和第一次国内革命战争时期（原题为“党的成立和第一次国内革命战争时期”），第四章包含第三次国内革命战争时期，中华人民共和国的成立和经济恢复时期（原题同）。可是读者往往误以为这两章每章都只包含一个时期，而最后一个时期（中华人民共和国的成立和经济恢复时期）的划分和名称现在也还不便确定，所以删去“时期”字样是适当的。
    这本书对于中国共产党三十年历史的叙述，作了很好的尝试。新版本对初版本所作的文字上的修正和若干历史事实的补充都可以给读者以更清晰的观念。但人民出版社在出版这个书的工作上留下了一个小的疏忽，就是作者把新版本称为“再版”（见“再版声明”），而人民出版社在版权页注明为“重排三版”。究竟是“再版”呢，还是“三版”？叫人弄不清楚。这个疏忽应当在续印的时候加以改正。
