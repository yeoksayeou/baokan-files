	Studying Documents Has Further Corrected My Study Attitude
	Professor of History Department, Yenching University Hou Renzhi
	(I) A document derailed my
	"Thought Train"
	When this teacher ideological remolding study movement began, my own understanding of study had already gone through several different stages. Initially, more than two years ago, when I first returned to the liberated motherland from Europe, I really didn't feel that I had to undergo ideological remolding to participate well in the construction of the motherland. At that time, I had such a thought: when I was abroad, it was the time when the people's revolution in China was vigorously proceeding; now that I am back, the revolution has already been victorious, what a gratifying thing this is. The work of destroying the old society can be done by others, and I will participate in the construction work of the motherland. Isn't this following the progress of the times? Isn't this progress? But, looking back now, this kind of thinking is a most cowardly and selfish thought, a bad thought of hoping to muddle along into the glorious ranks of building the motherland without seeking reform.
	After that, after I initially learned the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, I first felt that my professional work needed to be transformed. I originally studied history, and later changed to geography. I still remember when I was about to return to China, someone jokingly said to me: "You are lucky to have changed your profession now, otherwise you would have to start all over again after you go back; otherwise, you will be unemployed!" Although he said this jokingly, I thought it was not entirely unreasonable. But soon after I came back, I found that even the geography I studied had to be completely transformed. After I reached this understanding, the first thing I wanted to do was to learn Russian, so as to absorb more new ideas and viewpoints from the Soviet geography community. Secondly, I started to study political economics, thinking that this was the theoretical basis for transforming my geography. But looking back now, this awakening of demanding professional transformation was indeed good, but its motivation was still for myself. I wanted to be able to stand firm in my professional work, so that I could still have a foothold in the geography community of New China. This kind of professional transformation carried out first for oneself will never be transformed well. To transform well, one must first transform one's own thinking, so that one can first become a person who wholeheartedly serves the people. But I was far from realizing this at the time.
	Finally, the People's Government gave me the opportunity to visit the land reform. In the land reform, I first discovered that there was a great distance between my own thoughts and feelings and those of the working people. Unless I can completely transform myself ideologically, I will not be able to live happily in today's New China, let alone wholeheartedly serve the people. Up to this point, I felt for the first time in my life that it was necessary to completely transform myself. Therefore, when this teacher ideological remolding study movement began, I did have a conscious demand. I am willing to welcome this organized and led study movement, and completely transform myself in this movement. During the study, I once compared myself to a person seeking medical treatment for an illness, but as for how to treat my illness, I didn't know.
	Soon after the study began, I gradually felt that the biggest problem was not only in affirming that I was sick, but more importantly in how to grasp the crux of my illness. Otherwise, I would only repeatedly examine some trivial issues in my attitude or style, vainly vulgarizing the precious slogan of "self-criticism," and still not be able to discover the crux of my illness. But how can one discover the crux of one's ideological illness? Speaking of it, this is really not an easy thing. Because I feel that intellectuals like us have already formed a whole set of deeply rooted ideological systems in our minds. Our own thoughts often circle back and forth within this system, and never break out of its scope. To make an analogy, it is like a children's toy train track, which has been firmly placed on the table. As long as the toy train is wound up, it can turn back and forth on the established track and never derail. If you want it to derail, you must first open a section of the track. Based on my personal preliminary experience today, I think that ideological remolding first lies in being able to derail one's own ideological train. However, to derail one's own ideological train, the first step is to open the weakest link in one's old ideological track first. Once this link is opened, the entire "thought train" will derail! Only at this time can we talk about laying new tracks, so that our "thought train" can move forward on the new tracks.
	If I have already gained some preliminary gains in the past two months of study, that is to say, my old ideological system has been broken through at its weakest link, and I have had the experience of the first "ideological train" derailment! What helped me open the weakest link in my old ideological track was Stalin's "Conversation with the British Writer H.G. Wells."
	(II) A "Great and Progressive
		Thinker" Collapsed Before My Eyes
	On November 14th, the People's Daily published Stalin's "Conversation with the British Writer H.G. Wells." That day, I attended a meeting in the city all day, and didn't see the day's newspaper until I got home at night. When I saw the title of this article, it immediately attracted me. Why? Because I myself had been greatly influenced by H.G. Wells. As far back as twenty years ago, when I was still in middle school, I was deeply moved by reading his "A Short History of the World" (not even his "The Outline of History"). This little book first enlightened my interest in reading history, and made me feel for the first time a concern for the future of mankind, as if my vision had suddenly expanded. Secondly, after I entered university, I encountered his massive 800-page book called "The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind." In this book, he greatly promoted his "socialist" ideas. He clearly told readers that the old society of capitalism was nearing collapse, and a new "socialist" society was about to be born. With our current scientific production capacity and technology, we should organize ourselves well, manage our own lives from the perspective of the survival and happiness of all mankind, increase our social wealth, and use new education and other social activities to eliminate hatred between human beings and promote mutual understanding, in order to enter a future of infinite wealth and unlimited happiness - a new "socialist" world. What a beautiful vision of the future life of mankind this is. This really aroused infinite yearning in my young heart, and thus made me have infinite respect for the author of this book.
	Up until the evening of November 14th, at the moment when I picked up that day's newspaper, H.G. Wells was still a "great and progressive thinker" in my mind - although I hadn't thought of him for a long time. At the moment, I spent about an hour reading this conversation. In the quiet night, I was completely immersed in the conversation between Stalin and H.G. Wells, listening carefully to each person's reasons. But once the conversation ended, when I stood up from my chair again, I felt as if my own "thought train" had derailed. The standards of right and wrong and good and evil that I had been accustomed to judging things with suddenly turned upside down. At this time, H.G. Wells was no longer a "great and progressive thinker" in my imagination. In front of a giant of wisdom, he seemed to have suddenly shrunk into a "thought dwarf."
	I don't know very clearly why I suddenly had such thoughts at that time. In short, I felt that H.G. Wells' theory was ultimately untenable. I felt that he had been refuted by Stalin beyond recognition. But if I were to restate Stalin's reasoning, I still couldn't grasp its key points. So I asked myself to further study this document. Finally, I used a stupid method to help my own study: when I saw that H.G. Wells had raised a relatively important or relatively sharp question in the dialogue, I would first try to answer it myself, and then carefully look at Stalin's answer. In this way, I was able to more deeply understand the truth that Stalin insisted on. After going through such a study, I began to discover that the most important reason why H.G. Wells' theory could not be established was that he stubbornly refused to admit the basic fact of the opposition between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In other words, he could not see classes in his eyes, only individuals. Therefore, when he was "propagating socialist and world cosmopolitan ideas," he only emphasized the importance of organizing individual "technical intellectuals," but could not see - even deliberately did not want to see class struggle. So when Stalin asked him: "...Is it possible to deny the opposition between classes, the opposition between the propertied class, the capitalist class, and the laboring class, the proletarian class?" he directly answered: "I object to this method of simply dividing mankind into the poor and the rich." Therefore, Stalin had to warn him again and again: "...But human society is first of all divided into the rich and the poor, the propertied and the exploited. To set aside this basic division, to set aside the contradiction between the poor and the rich, is to set aside the basic fact... I repeat: to set aside this basic division of society and this basic struggle between the two major classes is to obliterate the fact. This struggle is going on, and will continue to go on. The result of this struggle is determined by the proletarian class, the laboring class." Could Stalin's words be said more firmly and clearly than this? But H.G. Wells still refused to admit it, and turned the conversation lightly to some secondary issues again.
	Can we say that H.G. Wells has no class viewpoint? No, absolutely not. Because in his conversation, he showed extremely stubborn class viewpoints. However, the class viewpoint he insisted on was not the class viewpoint of the proletariat, but the class viewpoint of the bourgeoisie; not the class viewpoint of the emerging class, but the class viewpoint of the declining class. And it was precisely for this reason that he could only advocate reform and dared not face revolution squarely. Therefore, whenever Stalin mentioned the opposition between the two basic classes in the world and the inevitable overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat to obtain the final revolutionary victory, H.G. Wells always put on a compassionate face to defend the bourgeoisie. So he said: "I think that the antagonism between the two worlds should not be particularly emphasized, but that we should try to combine all construction movements, all construction forces as much as possible." What is the meaning of this sentence? It is not difficult to understand.
	Before I studied this document, I often talked about the term "class viewpoint." However, this term was always abstract and lacked content for me. It wasn't until after I studied this document that I saw for the first time the specific meaning and specific content of this term, and even can be said to be the specific power! Why? Because it was under the measure of this term that a "great and progressive thinker" that I had always admired collapsed before my eyes - completely collapsed! At the same time, reflecting on myself, I have always only been able to see individuals and not classes, but in reality I have been adhering to the bourgeois viewpoint to measure things and think about problems. As a result, although I subjectively thought that I was "above classes," in reality I was wholeheartedly serving the bourgeoisie; although I subjectively thought that I was "noble," in reality I was willingly serving as a tool of the bourgeoisie. For example, in the past (during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang) I worked hard to teach and actively took on administrative work at Yenching University. Even though I thought that I was doing things based on my "conscience" at the beginning, this cannot help me to wash away the mistakes of the past. Because now I have realized that even a person's "conscience" has a certain class standpoint. The reason why I stayed at Yenching University wholeheartedly in the past and rejected the call of the Chinese people's revolutionary forces (I had been persuaded to go to the Western Hills to participate in the work of the old liberated areas twice before liberation, but I refused) was because my "conscience" had separated from the standpoint of the Chinese people.
	(III) "A Phoenix Cannot Be Hatched from a
		Crow's Nest"
	Now, after I have initially established this class viewpoint, I can no longer admire H.G. Wells as a "great and progressive thinker," but also make me realize that he is a maintainer of capitalist society, a most tempting and deceptive, and therefore a most terrible enemy!
	I used to think he was "great" because he said in his speech that he was thinking of the entire human race; I used to say he was "progressive" because I thought he dared to criticize the corruption of capitalist society and openly promote the "socialist" future. I think H.G. Wells himself was quite proud of this subjectively, so in the conversation he said: "In recent years, I have done and thought a lot about the need to promote socialist and world cosmopolitan ideas in the broad engineering, aviation, and military technology circles, etc." He even boasted in front of Stalin: "I think I am more left than you, Mr. Stalin, I think the world is close to the day of the death of the old system!" H.G. Wells is right, the old capitalist system is bound to die, and it has already begun to die, but what has Mr. H.G. Wells done to accelerate the death of the old capitalist system? I don't think he's done anything at all. On the contrary, what he has done is to transform this old, dying capitalist system again so that it can survive. The way to do this is the "socialism implied by the Anglo-Saxons" that he promotes. This is what Stalin mentioned in "The International Nature of the October Revolution" as the so-called "social democracy" at that time. From the standpoint of the bourgeoisie, this cannot but be said to be "progressive," but from the standpoint of the proletariat, this must be reactionary. Because it not only did not promote the collapse of the old capitalist system, but supported the old capitalist system. Therefore, Stalin wrote very clearly in the last paragraph of "The International Nature of the October Revolution": "Present-day social democracy is the ideological pillar of capitalism. Lenin said very correctly: present-day social democratic politicians are 'the real dogs of the bourgeoisie in the workers' movement, and the agents of the capitalists among the workers';...Unless social democracy in the workers' movement is eliminated, capitalism cannot be eliminated." When I realized this
	At this point, the harmfulness of the kind of pseudo-progressive but actually reactionary thinking represented by H.G. Wells was nakedly exposed before my eyes, but I had always been a prisoner of this reactionary thinking. Not only that, but even unintentionally I "peddled" this tempting and deceptive reactionary thinking, spreading it among my friends and students, making myself the enemy's most loyal "voluntary propagandist" without realizing it. In my thinking, "failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves" had reached this level. Looking back now, it was really extremely dangerous and terrible!
	In the kind of panic-stricken mood described above, I read again a passage written by Chairman Mao more than two years ago in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The people's state protects the people. With the people's state, the people can, on a national scale and on an overall scale, educate and transform themselves by democratic methods, so as to free themselves from the influence of internal and external reactionaries (this influence is still very great now, and will exist for a long time, and cannot be eliminated quickly), and transform the bad habits and bad ideas they have obtained from the old society, so as not to go to the wrong path guided by the reactionaries, and continue to move forward towards socialist society and communist society." I had read this passage before, but at that time I stubbornly could not see myself in this passage, and therefore had no understanding at all. The reason is that at that time I had not felt that I had been influenced by any internal and external reactionaries, or that I had any bad ideas from the old society. Now I know that in the past I was not only influenced by internal and external reactionaries, but also kept many bad ideas from the old society to this day. If someone had said that I had reactionary ideas two months ago, I would have argued with him until my face was red, but now I no longer deny this fact. But am I therefore passive and disappointed? No, not at all. On the contrary, I have therefore increased my courage and enthusiasm for learning, because now we have the people's state, and we have all the possible conditions for transforming our various wrong ideas. This is something to be thankful for!
	Because of the above understanding, now I have a more clear and more positive view of this teacher ideological remolding study movement. Today, the motherland has put forward clear requirements for the next generation of young people, that is, they must be able to become the builders of the glorious new democratic society and the future socialist and communist society. If I myself cannot transform the bad ideas I brought from the old society, how can I make my students become the builders of the glorious new society? There is a saying among the common people in the north: "A phoenix cannot be hatched from a crow's nest!" If I myself am still an ugly "crow" in my thoughts, how can I hope that my students will become beautiful "phoenixes"? However, the current task requires me to be able to hatch beautiful "phoenixes" from my own "nest," so I must fight to the end for this glorious task! I believe that under the leadership and education of the Communist Party, I can definitely transform myself and can successfully complete my task!

     学习文件使我进一步端正了自己的学习态度
    燕京大学历史系教授  侯仁之
    （一）一个文件打得我的
    “思想列车”出轨了
    当这一次教师思想改造学习运动开始的时候，我自己对于学习的认识已经经历了几个不同的阶段。最初，还在两年多以前，当我刚从欧洲回到了解放后的祖国时，我实在没有觉得自己还必须经过思想改造才能好好参加祖国的建设。那时我曾经有过这样的一种想法：当我在国外的时候，正是国内人民革命轰轰烈烈地进行的时候；现在我回来了，革命已经胜利了，这是多么可庆幸的一件事啊。摧毁旧社会的工作可以让别人去作，我来参加祖国的建设工作，这不就是跟着时代前进么？这不就是进步么？可是，现在回想起来，这种思想正是一种最怯懦最自私的思想，正是一种不求改造就希望可以马马虎虎混进光荣的建设祖国的队伍中去的坏思想。
    其后，在我初步学习了马列主义的基本知识之后，我首先感觉到自己的业务有进行改造的必要了。我原是学历史的，以后才改学地理。我还记得当我回国之前，有人向我半开玩笑地说道：“你现在幸而是改行了，否则回去以后就非要重新学起不可；不然，会失业的！”他这话虽然是半开玩笑的，但是我却以为并不是全无道理。可是回来之后不久，我发现连我所学的地理学也非要彻底改造不可了。我在达到了这样的认识之后，首先是想学俄文，以便多多吸取苏联地理学界的新思想和新观点。其次，我又着手研读政治经济学，以为这是改造我的地理学的理论基础。但是现在回想，这种要求业务改造的觉悟固然不错，可是其动机却仍然是为了自己。我要求自己在业务上能够站得住，使我仍然可以在新中国的地理学界立足。这种首先为了自己而进行的业务改造，是永远不会改造得好的。要想改造得好，就必须先来改造自己的思想，使自己首先能够成为一个全心全意为人民服务的人。但是关于这一点，我在当时还远没有认识到。
    最后，人民政府给了我参观土地改革的机会。在土地改革中我首先发现了我自己的思想感情和劳动人民的思想感情是有着极大的距离的。除非我能够从思想上把自己彻底加以改造，否则我就不可能很愉快地生活在今天的人民新中国，更谈不到全心全意为人民服务了。到这时为止，我算是生平第一次感觉到有彻底改造自己的必要了。所以到这次教师思想改造学习运动开始的时候，我确有一种自觉的要求。我愿意迎接这个有组织有领导的学习运动，在这个运动中彻底改造我自己。在学习当中，我曾经把自己比做一个带病求医的人，至于如何去医治自己的病，那我就不知道了。
    学习开始之后不久，我就逐渐感觉到最大的问题不仅在于肯定自己有病，更重要的是在于如何抓住自己病症的症结。否则只是翻来覆去检讨了自己态度或作风上一些枝枝节节的问题，徒然把“自我批评”这个宝贵的口号庸俗化了，而仍然不能发现自己病症的症结。但是如何才能发现自己思想上病症的症结呢？说起来这实在不是一件容易事。因为我觉得像我们这样的知识分子，脑子里早已形成了一整套根深蒂固的思想体系。我们自己的思想常常在这个体系之中来回打圈子，而永远冲不出它的范围。作一个比喻来说，这就好像儿童玩具的火车轨道，已经十分牢靠地安置在桌面上了，只消把小火车上好了链条，它就可以在既定的轨道上转来转去而永远不会出轨，如果要它出轨，就必须先把轨道上的一节打开才有可能。以我个人今天所获得的初步经验来说，我以为思想改造首先就在于能够使自己思想上的列车出轨，然而要使自己思想上的列车出轨，第一步就得先把自己旧日的思想轨道上那最弱的一个环节打开。等到这个环节一旦打开了，整个的“思想列车”就要出轨了！到这时候，我们才谈得上另外铺设新的轨道，使自己的“思想列车”在新的轨道上向前开行。
    如果在过去两个月的学习中我已经有了一些初步收获的话，那就是说我旧日的思想体系已经在一个最弱的环节上被突破了，我已经有了第一次“思想列车”出轨的经验了！帮助我打开自己旧日思想轨道上那个最弱的环节的，就是斯大林“与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”。
    （二）一个“伟大而且前进的
        思想家”在我眼前崩溃了
    十一月十四日，人民日报上登出了斯大林“与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”这篇文章。那一天我在城里开了一天会，一直到夜晚回家才看到了当天的报纸。当我看到这篇文章的标题时，它就立刻吸住了我，为什么呢？因为我自己曾经受过威尔斯极大的影响。远在二十年前，当我还在中学读书的时候，我就曾经因为读了他的“世界史纲简编”（还不是他的“世界史纲”）而大受感动。他这部小书初次启发了我对于历史阅读的兴趣，并且使我第一次产生了一种关切人类未来的心情，好像自己的眼光忽然放大了似的。其次，在我进入大学之后，我又遇到了他的一部八百多页名叫“人类的工作财富与幸福”的巨著。在这部书里他大大地宣传了他的“社会主义”思想。他明白地告诉读者说资本主义的旧社会已近崩溃，一个新的“社会主义”的社会就要诞生，以我们现在科学生产的能力和技术，我们应该好好地组织起来，从全体人类的生存和幸福着眼来管理我们自己的生活，增加我们的社会财富，并用新的教育以及其他社会活动的方法，解除人类之间的仇恨，促进彼此的谅解，以求进入一个有无穷财富和无限幸福的未来——“社会主义”的新世界。这是何等美丽的一幅人类未来生活的远景啊。这在我青年时代的心灵里真是激起了无限的憧憬，因而也就使我对于这部书的作者有了无限的敬服。
    一直到十一月十四日的晚上，在我拿起当天报纸的那一刻，威尔斯在我的思想中仍然是一个“伟大而且前进的思想家”，——虽然我已经很久没有想起过他了。当下我用了约摸一个小时的功夫把这篇谈话读完。在寂静的夜里，我完全沉浸在斯大林和威尔斯的谈话中，细听他们每一个人的理由。但是谈话一旦终了，当我再从自己的椅子里站起来的时候，我好像觉得我自己的“思想列车”出轨了。我旧日所习惯的那种评判事物的是非和善恶的标准忽然倒了个儿了。这时威尔斯在我的想像中已经不再是一个“伟大而且前进的思想家”了，在一个智慧的巨人面前，他好像忽然缩成了一个“思想上的矮子”。
    当时我何以忽然会有如此想法，我自己也说不十分清楚，总之我觉得威尔斯的一套理论终究是站不住了。我觉得他已被斯大林批驳得体无完肤了。但是如果让我来重述斯大林的道理我仍然是抓不住他的要点。于是我就要求自己更进一步地来学习这个文件。最后，我曾用了一个笨法子来帮助自己的学习：当我看到威尔斯在对话中提出了一个比较重要或比较尖锐的问题时，我就先由自己来试行答复，然后再细看斯大林的答复。这样，我就使自己更深刻地体会到斯大林所坚持的道理。在经过这样的一度学习之后，我就开始发现威尔斯的理论之所以不能成立，最重要的就是在于他死也不肯承认资产阶级和无产阶级对立的这一基本事实，换句话说就是在他的眼睛里不能看见阶级，只能看见个人。因此，在他“宣传社会主义和世界大同主义思想”的时候，他只是一味强调组织“技术知识分子”个人的重要性，却不能看见——甚至故意不要看见阶级斗争。所以当斯大林问他说：“……难道能否认阶级之间的对立，有产阶级、资本家阶级与劳动阶级、无产者阶级之间的对立吗？”他却直截了当地回答说：“我反对这种把人类简单分为穷人和富人的方法。”因此，斯大林就不得不一次又一次地警告他说：“……但是人类社会首先是分为富人和穷人、有产者与被剥削者，撇开这个基本的划分，撇开穷人和富人之间的矛盾，就是撇开基本事实……我重说一遍：撇开社会底这一基本划分和两大基本阶级间的这一基本斗争，就是抹煞事实。这一斗争正在进行着，而且将进行下去。这一斗争的结果是决定于无产者阶级、劳动者阶级。”斯大林的话还能说得比这个更坚定更明确么？而威尔斯却依然不肯承认，就又把谈话轻轻转到一些次要的问题上去了。
    我们能说威尔斯是没有阶级观点么？不能，完全不能。因为在他的谈话里，他表现了极其顽强的阶级观点。不过他所坚持的阶级观点，不是无产阶级的阶级观点，而是资产阶级的阶级观点；不是新兴阶级的阶级观点，而是没落阶级的阶级观点。而且就是因为这个缘故，他就只能主张改良而不敢正视革命。因此，每当斯大林提到世界上两个基本阶级的对立以及无产阶级必然要推翻资产阶级而获得最后革命胜利的时候，威尔斯总是装出一副悲天悯人的面孔来替资产阶级辩护。所以他说：“我以为不应该特别强调两个世界间的对抗，而应该竭力把一切建设运动，一切建设力量尽可能地结合起来。”这句话的含义是什么呢？那是不难了解的。
    在我学习这个文件之前，我常常谈到“阶级观点”这个名辞。但是，这个名辞对于我始终是抽象的，是缺乏内容的。一直到我学习了这个文件之后，我才第一次看见了这个名辞的具体含义和具体的内容，甚至可以说是具体的力量！为什么呢？因为就是在这个名辞的衡量下，我一向所推崇的一个“伟大而且前进的思想家”在我眼前崩溃了，——彻底崩溃了！同时回想我自己，我也是一向只能看见个人而不能看见阶级的，但实际上我却是坚持着资产阶级的观点来衡量事物和思索问题的。结果，在主观上我虽然认为自己是“超阶级”的，实际上却是死心踏地为资产阶级服务的；在主观上我虽然认为自己是“清高”的，实际上却是甘心乐意作了资产阶级的工具。例如以往（国民党反动统治时期）我在燕京大学努力教书和积极担任行政工作。纵然我认为当初自己也是本着“良心”来作事的，可是这并不能帮助我来洗刷过去的错误。因为现在我已经认识到就是一个人的“良心”也是有一定的阶级立场的。以往我之所以死心踏地留在燕京大学工作而拒绝了中国人民革命力量的招呼（远在解放之前我曾经有两次被争取到西山里面参加老解放区的工作，可是我都拒绝了），就是因为我的“良心”已经和中国人民的立场分了家。
    （三）“乌鸦的窠里孵不出
        凤凰来”
    现在，在我初步树立了这个阶级观点之后，对于威尔斯这样的人，我不但不能再推崇他为一个“伟大而且前进的思想家”，而且使我认识了他是一个资本主义社会的维护者，是一个最富有诱惑性欺骗性因而也是一个最可怕的敌人！
    以前我认为他是“伟大”的，因为他口口声声说是为全人类着想的；我说他是“前进”的，因为我认为他敢于抨击资本主义社会的腐败而公然宣传“社会主义”的未来。我想威尔斯自己在主观上也是颇以这一点而自负的，所以在谈话中他曾经说道：“近几年来，关于必须在广大的工程师界、飞机师界和军事技术界等等宣传社会主义和世界大同主义思想，我已作了许多、想了许多。”甚至他还在斯大林面前夸口说：“我觉得我比您更左些，斯大林先生，我认为世界已经接近于旧制度死亡的日子了！”威尔斯说得不错，资本主义的旧制度是一定要死亡的，而且已经开始死亡了，但是威尔斯先生究竟作了些什么事情来加速资本主义旧制度的死亡呢？我认为他什么事情都没有作。相反的，他所作的正是要把这个旧的即将死亡的资本主义制度再加以改造，使它能够苟延残喘。这个改造的办法就是他所宣传的“盎格鲁撒克逊人所意味的社会主义”。这也就是斯大林在“十月革命的国际性质”里所提到的当时所谓“社会民主主义”。从资产阶级立场来看，这不能不说是“进步”的，但是要从无产阶级的立场来看，这就必然是反动的。因为它不但没有促进资本主义旧制度的崩溃，反而支持了资本主义旧制度。所以斯大林在“十月革命的国际性质”一文的最后一段里，就十分明确地写道：“现时的社会民主主义是资本主义底思想支柱。列宁说得万分正确：现时的社会民主党政治家，是‘资产阶级在工人运动中的真正走狗，是资本家在工人中间的代办’；……除非消灭工人运动中的社会民主主义，就无法消灭资本主义。”当我自己认识到了这
    一点的时候，威尔斯所代表的那种伪装进步而实在是反动的思想的危害性，就赤裸裸地暴露在我眼前了，而我却一直作了这种反动思想的俘虏。不但如此，甚至我还在有意无意之间“贩卖”了这种富有诱惑性欺骗性的反动思想，把它散布在我的朋友和学生之间，使我自己作了敌人最忠实的“义务宣传员”而仍不自知。在我的思想中，“敌我不分”竟然到了这种程度，如今回想，那真是危险极了，可怕极了！
    就在以上所说的这种惶恐不安的情绪下，我再一次读到了两年多以前毛主席在“论人民民主专政”里所写下的一段话：“人民的国家是保护人民的。有了人民的国家，人民才有可能，在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展。”从前我不是没有读过这一段，但是那时读了硬是在这一段里看不到我自己，因此也就毫无体会。原因就在于那时我还未曾觉得我自己受过什么内外反动派的影响，或是有什么从旧社会得来的坏思想。现在我才知道，在以往我不但受了内外反动派的影响，而且还把许多从旧社会得来的坏思想一直保留到今天。如果在两个月以前有人说我有反动思想，我一定会和他争个面红耳赤，可是现在我再不否认这一事实了。但是我竟因此而消极和失望么？不，一点也不。反之，我却因此而愈益增加了自己学习的勇气和热情，因为现在我们已经有了人民的国家，有了改造自己各种错误思想的一切可能的条件。这是值得庆幸的事情！
    因为有了以上的认识，现在我对于这一次的教师思想改造学习运动也就得到了一个更明确更积极的看法。今天祖国对下一代的青年已经提出了明确的要求，那就是一定要他们能够成为光荣的新民主主义社会以及将来的社会主义和共产主义社会的建设者。如果我自己还不能改造自己从旧社会带来的坏思想，我又如何能够使我的学生成为光荣的新社会的建设者呢？北方的老百姓有一句俗话说：“乌鸦的窠里孵不出凤凰来！”如果我自己在思想上还是一只丑陋的“乌鸦”，我怎么能够希望我的学生成为美丽的“凤凰”呢？但是，当前的任务一定要我能够在自己的“窠里”孵出美丽的“凤凰”来，因此我就一定要为这个光荣的任务奋斗到底！我相信自己在共产党的领导和教育下，一定可以改造我自己并且可以圆满完成我的任务的！
