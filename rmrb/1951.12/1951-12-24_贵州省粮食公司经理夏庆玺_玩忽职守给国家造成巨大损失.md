    Xia Qingxi, Manager of Guizhou Province Grain Company,
    Neglects His Duty, Causing Huge Losses to the State
    Xia Qingxi, manager of Guizhou Province Grain Company, neglected his duty, was ideologically paralyzed, failed to conduct reviews, and blindly trusted personnel with unclear political backgrounds, resulting in a serious incident involving the leakage of state secrets and the loss of 350 million yuan in state property. The Guizhou Provincial People's Government has requested approval from the superior government to give Xia Qingxi the punishment of dismissal.
    In August 1950, Xia Qingxi went to Beijing to attend the National Grain Conference and, without the permission of his superiors, took Yang Benyuan (a retained employee) who was working as a secretary in the company, as his assistant. After the meeting closed on September 22, Xia Qingxi returned home (Dongping, Shandong), and handed over utensils worth over 10 million yuan, as well as meeting records, blank seals, etc., to Yang Benyuan to take back to Guizhou first. After Yang arrived in Hankou, he engaged in fraudulent activities, first carving Xia Qingxi's personal seal, falsely claiming to purchase rice milling machines and sacks, and telegraphing the Guizhou Provincial Grain Company to defraud them of 350 million yuan in remittances before fleeing to Hong Kong with the documents. The occurrence of this incident shows that Xia Qingxi had no regard for organization, neglected his duties, and completely lost his political vigilance. The Guizhou Provincial People's Government has already given Xia Qingxi the punishment of dismissal in August of this year, and is pursuing the arrest of the criminal Yang Benyuan to bring him to justice.

    贵州省粮食公司经理夏庆玺
    玩忽职守给国家造成巨大损失
    贵州省粮食公司经理夏庆玺，玩忽职守，思想麻痹，不加审查，盲目信任政治面貌不清的人员，造成了泄露国家机密，损失国家财产三亿五千万元的严重事件。贵州省人民政府已呈请上级政府批准，给夏庆玺以撤职处分。
    一九五○年八月，夏庆玺到北京参加全国粮食会议，没有经过上级许可，擅自带领公司担任秘书工作的杨本源（留用人员）为助手。九月二十二日闭会后，夏庆玺回了家（山东东平），把价值千余万元的用具及会议记录、空白印信等，交杨本源先带回贵州。杨到汉口后，就进行骗款活动，先刻夏庆玺私章，诡称购买打米机和麻袋，发电报向贵州省粮食公司骗得汇款三亿五千万元，连同文件潜逃香港。这件事情的发生，说明夏庆玺目无组织、玩忽职务，完全丧失了政治警觉性。贵州省人民政府已经在今年八月间给夏庆玺撤职处分，并通缉杨本源罪犯归案法办。
