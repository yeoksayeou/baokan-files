    Guanghua Textile Factory Should Pay Attention to Female Workers' Welfare

    Comrade Editor: The administration and trade union of the publicly owned Guanghua Textile Factory in Beijing pay no attention to the welfare of female workers, which affects the female workers' production morale. The factory's workers are mostly female, but there is only one women's restroom. The women's restroom is behind the dormitory, more than two *li* away from the workplace; there is no roof over the toilet, and no walls around it. Only a few thin boards are placed over the pit. When it is cold, the urine all over the ground and boards freezes into ice, and one can easily slip and fall if one is not careful. There is also no electric light installed in the women's restroom, but the administrative cadres say: "During the period of austerity, lights cannot be installed." We have repeatedly asked the administration and the trade union to increase the number of women's restrooms, but they ignore us. We have no choice but to drink less boiled water. Now, everyone is complaining and cannot muster the energy to work at all. The Guanghua Textile Factory is under the leadership of the publicly owned Yongmao Industrial Company. We female workers hope that Yongmao Industrial Company will send someone to the factory to investigate.

### 光华纺织厂应重视女工福利

    光华纺织厂应重视女工福利
    编辑同志：北京市公营光华纺织厂行政和工会方面，毫不重视女工福利，影响了女工的生产情绪。这个厂的工人以女工为多，但女厕所只有一所。女厕所在宿舍后面，距离工作场所二里多路；厕所的上面没有棚，周围也没有墙，坑上只架着几块薄板。天冷了，满地满板的尿都结成了冰，一不留心就可滑倒。女厕所里也不装一盏电灯，行政干部却说：“节约时期，不能装灯。”我们曾经多次向行政和工会提出增加女厕所的要求，他们都不理。我们没有办法，只好少吃开水。现在，大家都怨声载道，根本打不起劲来工作。光华纺织厂属于公营永茂实业公司领导，我们女工希望永茂实业公司派人来厂调查。    光华纺织厂女工 毛卓民
