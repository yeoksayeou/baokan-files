    November in Lhasa
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Shenying
    In November, the mountain peaks surrounding Lhasa are already covered with white snow, but the average temperature in Lhasa city is still around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Farmers in the suburbs of Lhasa are busy with the autumn harvest, and piles of wheat and highland barley are stacked near the villages. From ten miles east of Lhasa, along the green Lhasa River to the west of Lhasa, is a beautiful landscape painting. Near the foothills, the snow-covered mountains are reflected in the river. Flocks of wild ducks and white cranes stand on the river滩 or fly freely in the sky and on the water. Along the Lhasa River near the Lhasa city area is a long row of lush trees. Here are Tibet's famous Zhongji Linka, Ceide Linka, Zifu Linka, and Luobulinka (Linka means park). Inside the Linka grow willows unique to Tibet. Although it is November, the trees are still full of green leaves.
    The people of Lhasa are rejoicing over many new things. Many Tibetan people's homes, shops, and temples have hung portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Many people have learned the "The East is Red" song praising Chairman Mao. The broad masses of Tibetan people have established a deep friendship with the People's Liberation Army. Groups of Tibetan men and women carry baskets full of beef, mutton, radishes, horse grass, and cow dung (fuel) every day to sell at the gate of the People's Liberation Army supply department. After the Tibetan compatriots sell their goods, they sing happily as they walk home.
    At this time, Lhasa is in a prosperous period of commodity distribution. New wheat has already entered the market. Every noon, the crowded streets of Lhasa are filled with people coming and going. Merchants, farmers, and herdsmen from all over Tibet come to Lhasa in a continuous stream to trade. They bring large amounts of butter and zanba and exchange them for large quantities of cloth and tea. Whether they are from Lhasa or from other parts of Tibet, when they see that the People's Liberation Army speaks kindly and trades fairly, they happily say: "The People's Liberation Army trades fairly and maintains stable prices, and our lives are getting better." A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa is negotiating with the Tibetan local government to survey wasteland and prepare to launch a large-scale production campaign. Many Tibetan blacksmiths and carpenters are busy making iron picks, iron shovels, hoes, and earth baskets for the People's Liberation Army. The Tibetan compatriots tell each other: "The People's Liberation Army is also reclaiming wasteland for production; it is truly a good army for us Tibetan people."

    十一月的拉萨
    新华社记者  赵慎应
    十一月，拉萨四周的山顶上，已积满了白雪，但拉萨市区的平均温度还在华氏五十度左右。拉萨郊区的农民们正忙着秋收，村庄的附近堆着一堆堆的麦子和青稞。从拉萨以东十里，顺着碧绿的拉萨河到拉萨的西边，是一幅美丽的风景画。靠近山麓的地方，白雪皑皑的山头，倒映在河里。成群的野鸭和白鹤伫立在河滩上，或自由地飞翔在天空和水面。傍着拉萨市区的拉萨河畔，是一长排茂密的树林。这里有西藏著名的仲机林卡、侧德林卡、孜付林卡、罗布林卡（林卡即公园）。林卡里边长着西藏特有的柳树。虽是十一月的天气，还是满树绿叶。
    拉萨人民正为许多新的事情欢欣鼓舞。许多藏族人民的家里、商店和寺院都挂起了毛主席、朱总司令的像。不少的人学会了歌颂毛主席的“东方红”歌曲。广大的藏族人民已和解放军建立起深厚的友谊。成群的藏族男女，每天背着满筐的牛肉、羊肉、萝卜和马草、牛粪（燃料），到解放军供给部的门口去出卖。藏胞们卖了东西后，都欢唱着走回家去。
    这时的拉萨，正是货物集散的繁荣时期。新麦已经上市。每天中午，拉萨街道上密集的人群，来来往往。西藏各地的商人、农民和牧民，络绎不绝地到拉萨来进行交易。他们带来了大量酥油、糌粑，换回去大批的布匹、茶叶。不管是拉萨的或者是来自各地的藏族人民，他们看到解放军说话和气，买卖公平，都欢喜地说：“解放军公平交易，保持了物价平稳，我们的日子好过了。”驻在拉萨的人民解放军某部，正和西藏地方政府协商勘查荒地，准备展开大规模的生产运动。许多藏族铁匠和木匠，正忙着给解放军做铁镐、铁锹、锄头和土筐。藏胞们相互传告：“解放军还要开荒生产，真是我们西藏人民的好军队。”
