    Report by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government on the National Ethnic Trade Conference
    (Report by Minister Ye Jizhuang at the 112th Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on November 23, 1951, approved at the same meeting)
    (1) Conference Overview
    In accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council, our ministry convened the National Ethnic Trade Conference from August 17th to 31st. A total of 149 representatives attended, including representatives from major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, directly administered provinces and cities in North China, and relevant central departments. Among them, 98 were representatives from various regions and 42 were representatives from ethnic minorities (including Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, Yao, Yi, Li, Zhuang, Dong, and Zhongjia nationalities).
    The conference was chaired by Vice Minister Sha Qianli of our ministry. Vice Minister Yao Yilin gave an introduction to the national state-owned trade situation in 1951. Vice Chairman Liu Geping of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission gave a report on ethnic policies. Chief representatives from various regions reported on the trade situation in ethnic minority areas before and after liberation, exchanged experiences, and raised opinions and requests. Regarding issues related to other departments (such as forestry, agriculture, transportation, railways, post and telecommunications, banking, insurance, taxation, weights and measures, etc.), symposiums were held, and written replies were provided by the relevant ministries, banks, and bureaus. Trade-related issues were discussed in groups and at the general assembly. Before the closing ceremony, 396 pieces of native and special products from various ethnic minority areas were exhibited, and a symposium was held to introduce the production and sales of various products, as well as their specifications and quality. On the last day of the conference, Vice Premier Chen of the Government Administration Council gave a speech, and Vice Minister Yao gave a summary report.
    (2) Current Trade Situation in
        Ethnic Minority Areas
    At this conference, the representatives first recalled the brutal plunder policies of past rulers. In some areas, these policies made them afraid to leave the mountains for many years. For example, Mongolian people in northern Gansu fled to the southern mountains of Gansu for more than 20 years. Last October was the first time they came out of the mountains to trade in Dunhuang, resulting in many people going without salt for years. Herdsmen in Suiyuan often could not afford cotton clothing. In many areas, there were extremely unfair trade practices. For example, Li people in Hainan Island would exchange a chicken for a needle. In Xinjiang under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, when trade with the Soviet Union was cut off, wool went unsheared, and casings were fed to dogs. Large scales were used for buying, and small scales for selling. What made the fraternal nationalities most angry and unbearable was the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's years of harsh taxes and levies, conscription, and grain demands, placing them on the verge of starvation and death. Ethnic minorities in Guangxi said, "If you had come a month later, we would have almost starved to death."
    The situation after liberation is greatly different. In most ethnic minority areas across the country, under the leadership of the local people's governments, over 750 state-owned trade company branches, sales departments, purchasing stations, and processing plants have been established, along with a large number of mobile trade teams. There are more than 1,700 ethnic minority trade workers. These trade organizations, based on Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's ethnic policies and trade policies, have generally implemented fair and reasonable principles in pricing, and have promoted and guided private merchants to supply goods in as large quantities as possible. State-owned companies alone, as of June 1951 (excluding Xinjiang), had a total trade volume of 505.33 billion yuan, which significantly changed the exchange ratio of commodities in ethnic minority areas. The prices of native and special products have increased, and the prices of daily necessities have decreased. For example, in 1947, one ton of grain in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region could only be exchanged for half a bolt of Wufu cloth, but in 1950, it could be exchanged for more than two bolts of cloth, an increase of more than four times. In 1949, 200 kilograms of wool in Xinjiang could only be exchanged for one bolt of blue cloth, but in November 1950, only 30 kilograms of wool were needed to exchange for one bolt of blue cloth. Before liberation, 100 catties of wool in Qinghai could only be exchanged for one and a half bricks of tea, but in 1950, it could be exchanged for twelve bricks of tea. In the Dading Miao area of Guizhou, before liberation, 100 catties of tung oil could only be exchanged for 23 catties of salt, but now it can be exchanged for 160 catties of salt. The exchange ratio in various places has generally gradually become fair and reasonable, and many have already achieved fairness and reasonableness. Due to the reasonable exchange ratio, the purchasing power of ethnic minority people has greatly increased, encouraging their enthusiasm for production. Currently, the main shortcomings are that trade organizations are not widespread and deep enough, funds are insufficient, and there is a lack of specialized research and guidance, in addition to the fact that individual regions do not pay enough attention to trade work. For example, Liannan County in northern Guangdong only has one county-level company, which has only operated over 100 million yuan in the year since its establishment. The tea shipped from the Northwest is generally of lower quality. At the same time, due to inconvenient transportation, the supply of daily necessities is not sufficient. In short, the lives of people in general ethnic minority areas are difficult. Although trade work since liberation has made some achievements, it has not fully met the needs of ethnic minorities in various places. In the future, we must continue to adopt a positive attitude and continue to develop trade in ethnic minority areas.
    (3) Future Trade Guidelines and Policies
        for Ethnic Minority Areas
    (1) In order to meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of ethnic minorities and further help them develop production and improve their lives, state-owned trade enterprises should be established and developed actively and systematically in ethnic minority areas based on different situations. Various forms such as comprehensive subsidiaries, specialized companies, mobile teams, and consignment shops should be adopted to expand the commercial network in ethnic minority areas, help them sell native and special products, and supply daily necessities and means of production that meet their needs. In areas where conditions permit the organization of cooperatives, actively support the development of cooperatives. At the same time, conduct economic surveys to facilitate planned construction and material exchange.
    (2) Since most ethnic minority areas are sparsely populated, have inconvenient transportation, and dispersed villages, it is difficult for state-owned trade enterprises alone to fully meet the exchange needs of ethnic minorities. Under the leadership and organization of trade administrative organs and state-owned trade enterprises, unite legitimate private merchants to conduct trade in ethnic minority areas, and help ethnic minority people engage in commerce. Help various ethnic minority areas restore and establish regular markets (primary markets). Establish state-owned trade organizations or mobile teams in these markets to strengthen market management, ensure fair and reasonable transactions by public and private manufacturers, and gradually improve the trading system.
    (3) Implement the price policy of considering both public and private interests and fairness and reasonableness, and adopt a combination of economic leadership and administrative management to resolutely oppose any deception and plunder of ethnic minority people. A correct price policy should take into account the reasonable profits of production, transportation, and sales, and, according to needs and possibilities, support promising handicrafts in ethnic minority areas, and reduce the difficulties in supplying daily necessities caused by inconvenient transportation. In order to lay a long-term trade foundation and improve the specifications and quality of native and special products, in addition to implementing price differences based on grade, organize on-site processing and packaging to reduce transportation costs and consolidate and expand sales. The goal is to gradually achieve smooth flow of goods and production development for both the native and special products of ethnic minority areas and the means of production and daily necessities needed by ethnic minorities, under the guidance of a correct price policy.
    (4) Actively train and cultivate ethnic minority trade cadres. The cadre schools of trade departments of major administrative regions and the commercial (industry and commerce) departments of provincial people's governments should run training classes for ethnic minority cadres. State-owned trade organizations in ethnic minority areas should employ a large number of ethnic minority cadres, adopting a training method of learning by doing, teaching while learning, and gradually improving their political, professional, and cultural level.
    (4) Opinions on the Organizational Form of
        State-Owned Trade Organizations in Ethnic Minority Areas
        and Other Issues
    (1) Regarding the organizational form of state-owned trade organizations in ethnic minority areas
    The organizational form of state-owned trade organizations in ethnic minority areas should be determined based on the different conditions of each region and each ethnic group. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, due to the large area, large population, and strong leadership of the Autonomous Region government, the entire fiscal and economic work is a unit under the leadership of the Central People's Government. Therefore, it is appropriate for the state-owned trade organizations of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to adopt the current organizational form, that is, as a component of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, and implement the unified policies, plans, and systems of the country. However, in other ethnic minority areas across the country, the specific conditions are not entirely the same as those of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Therefore, it is not necessary to completely adopt the same form as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Major administrative regions, provinces, and ethnic groups can choose an organizational form suitable for the current local situation based on the different conditions of their region and ethnic group.
    (2) How to provide assistance to ethnic minorities in areas with particularly difficult living conditions through trade
    Among the ethnic minorities across the country, there are some areas where living conditions are particularly difficult due to poor geographical conditions (such as ethnic minorities on the national defense line in Yunnan, where the supply of daily necessities is very difficult due to the distance from the interior), excessive economic destruction by past reactionary governments, or the inability to find a market for their native and special products. It is necessary to provide special care to these areas in terms of trade.
    State-owned trade organizations may inevitably incur some losses in their operations due to providing special care to this small portion of areas. For example: Supplying them with some urgently needed daily necessities (such as salt and tea) at lower prices; Helping them sell their native products by steadily advancing; Gradually helping them improve quality through procurement; Establishing more state-owned trade organizations and mobile teams to maintain their supply
    (These state-owned trade organizations are sometimes unsustainable). The purpose of state-owned trade organizations in adopting these measures is to help ethnic minorities in these areas regain their vitality, develop production, and find sales channels within a certain period, and gradually establish their own cooperatives and businesses. This is a transitional measure to help them overcome difficulties, rather than a long-term policy of incurring losses and providing subsidies. The trade departments of the people's governments of major administrative regions should determine whether such special care is needed based on the specific conditions of their regions, and the amount of losses that must be incurred due to such care, and include it in the state-owned trade financial plan of the region.
    (3) State-owned trade enterprises in ethnic minority areas must be closely integrated with various economic departments (industry, agriculture, banking, taxation, cooperation, transportation) and related work under the unified leadership of local people's governments, implement policies, and rely on the masses. It is especially important to combine with defense departments in border areas.
    (4) In order to strengthen the leadership and assistance to ethnic minority trade work, the trade departments of the people's governments of major administrative regions and the commercial (industry and commerce) departments of provincial people's governments should establish special management organizations or set up special management cadres as needed, in order to specifically study and guide the progress of the work.
    (5) In commodity management, attention should be paid to the specific needs of local areas, such as medical supplies and production tools.
    Whether the above points are appropriate, please approve and instruct the Government Administration Council!

    中央人民政府贸易部关于全国民族贸易会议的报告
    （一九五一年十一月二十三日叶季壮部长在政务院第一百一十二次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    （一）会议情况
    遵照政务院的决定，本部于八月十七日至三十一日召开了全国民族贸易会议。到会者计有各大行政区、内蒙古自治区、中央直辖华北各省市及中央有关部门代表共一四九人，其中各地区代表九十八人，内少数民族代表四十二人（包括蒙、回、藏、维吾尔、苗、瑶、彝、黎、僮、侗、仲家等十一个民族）。
    会议由本部沙千里副部长主持，姚依林副部长作了一九五一年全国国营贸易情况的介绍，中央民族事务委员会刘格平副主任委员作了关于民族政策的报告，各地区首席代表汇报了解放前后少数民族地区的贸易情况，交流经验，并提出了意见和要求。其中有关其他部门的问题（如林业、农业、交通、铁道、邮电、银行、保险、税务、度量衡等），曾召开了座谈会，并由有关各部、行、局作了书面答复。属于贸易方面的问题，则举行分组讨论及大会讨论。在闭会前，展览了各少数民族地区的土产特产三九六件，并举行座谈会，介绍各种产品的产销情况与规格质量。会议最末一天，由政务院陈副总理讲话，姚副部长作了总结报告。
    （二）目前少数民族地区的
            贸易情况
    在这次会议上，代表们首先回忆了历代统治者对他们的残酷掠夺政策。有的地区使他们多年不敢出山，如甘肃北部蒙民逃往甘肃南山二十多年，去年十月第一次出山到敦煌进行贸易，以致很多人常年无盐吃。绥远牧民常年穿不上棉衣。很多地区在贸易上，存在着极端不公平现象，如海南岛黎胞以一只鸡换一枚针。新疆在国民党反动统治下，中苏贸易断绝时间，羊毛无人剪，肠衣有喂了狗的现象。交易时大秤入，小秤出。最使兄弟民族们气愤难忍的是蒋匪帮的连年苛征暴敛，抓丁、要粮，置他们于饥饿死亡线上。广西少数民族说：“你们再晚来一个月，我们就快饿死完了。”
    解放后的情况大大不同了，全国大多数少数民族地区，在当地人民政府领导下，已先后设置了国营贸易公司门市部、采购站、代销店、加工厂等七百五十个企业机构，和大批流动贸易小组。贸易工作干部中有少数民族一千七百多人。这些贸易机构，根据毛主席及中央人民政府的民族政策和贸易政策，在价格上基本上执行了公平合理的原则，并推动领导私商尽可能地大量供应了物资。仅国营公司，截至一九五一年六月止（新疆没有统计），贸易额共达五千○五十三亿三千多万元，使少数民族地区商品的交换比例发生了重大的变化，土产特产的价格提高了，日用必需品的价格降低了。例如一九四七年，内蒙古自治区一吨粮食只能换到半匹五福布，一九五○年已可换到两匹多布，增加了四倍多。一九四九年新疆二百公斤羊毛只能换到一匹青布，一九五○年十一月只要三十公斤羊毛就可以换到一匹青布。青海解放前一百斤羊毛只能换一块半砖茶，一九五○年可以换十二块砖茶。贵州大定苗族区在解放前一百斤桐油只能换二十三斤食盐，现在可换一百六十斤食盐。各地的交换比例，一般的已逐渐趋于公平合理，有不少已经达成公平合理。由于交换比例的合理。大大提高了少数民族人民的购买力，鼓舞了他们的生产情绪。当前所存在的问题，除个别地区对贸易工作重视不够外，主要的缺点还是贸易机构设置不够普遍深入，资金不足，缺乏专门的研究指导。如粤北连南县仅有一个县公司，成立一年多以来，仅经营一亿多元。西北运去的茶叶，一般茶质都低一等。同时因交通不便，日用品的供应尚不十分充足。总之，一般少数民族地区人民的生活是困难的，解放以来的贸易工作虽然有了一定的成绩，但对于各地少数民族的需要还没有得到完全满足，今后仍须采取积极态度，继续发展少数民族地区的贸易。
    （三）今后少数民族地区的
            贸易方针和政策
    （一）为了适应少数民族广大群众的迫切需要，进一步帮助其生产发展与生活改善，应当在少数民族地区，根据不同情况有计划地积极地建立与发展国营贸易企业机构，并采取一揽子公司、专业公司、流动小组、代销店等各种形式，扩大少数民族地区的商业网，帮助他们推销土产特产，供给合乎他们需要的生活资料与生产资料，在有条件组织合作社的地区，积极扶助合作社的发展，同时要进行经济调查，以便于计划建设与物资交流。
    （二）由于大部分少数民族居住地区，地广人稀，交通不便，村落分散，仅有国营贸易企业尚难完全满足少数民族交换之需要，应在贸易行政机关与国营贸易企业的领导和组织下，团结正当私商，对少数民族地区进行贸易，并帮助少数民族人民经营商业，帮助各少数民族地区恢复与建立定期的集市（初级市场）。并在这些市场上，建立国营贸易机构或流动小组，加强市场管理，以保证公私厂商进行公平合理的交易，并逐渐改进交易制度。
    （三）贯彻公私兼顾、公平合理的价格政策，采取经济领导与行政管理相结合的方法，坚决反对任何对少数民族人民的欺骗与掠夺。正确的价格政策，应当照顾产、运、销三方面的合理利润，并根据需要与可能，扶植少数民族地区有发展前途的手工业，减少因交通不便而造成的日用必需品供应的困难。为打下长远的贸易基础，提高土产、特产的规格质量，除实行品级差价外，并组织就地加工整装，以减轻运费与巩固扩大销路，使少数民族地区的土产特产，和少数民族所需要的生产资料与生活资料，均能在正确的价格政策指导下逐渐达到物畅其流、生产发展之目的。
    （四）积极训练与培养少数民族贸易干部，各大行政区人民政府贸易部干部学校，应开办少数民族干部训练班，在少数民族地区的国营贸易机构应大量任用少数民族干部，采取边做、边学、边教的培养方法，逐渐提高其政治、业务与文化水平。
    （四）对于少数民族地区国营
            贸易机构的组织形式和
            其他问题的意见
    （一）关于少数民族地区国营贸易机构的组织形式问题
    少数民族地区国营贸易机构的组织形式，应当根据各地区、各民族的不同情况来决定。在内蒙古自治区，由于地区大、人口多、有了坚强有力的自治区政府领导，在整个财政经济工作上，都是中央人民政府领导下的一个单位，因此内蒙古自治区的国营贸易机构采取目前的组织形式，即作为内蒙古自治政府的一个组成部分，并执行全国统一的政策、计划与制度，是适宜的。但在全国其他少数民族地区，由于各种具体条件与内蒙古自治区不尽相同，因此就不一定完全采取与内蒙古自治区相同的形式，各大行政区、各省、各民族可以根据本地区本民族的不同条件，因地制宜，选择适合于当时当地的情况的组织形式。
    （二）关于生活特殊困难地区的少数民族如何从贸易上给以帮助的问题
    在全国少数民族中，有小部分地区，由于所处地理条件过差（如云南国防线上的少数民族，因离内地过远，日用必需品的供给很困难），或由于过去反动政府在经济上的过度摧残，或由于他们所生产的土产特产尚未能找到销路，因此目前在生活上还有特殊困难。对于这些地区，在贸易上有加以特别照顾之必要。
    国营贸易机关由于特殊照顾这一小部分地区，在经营上有时不可避免的要有些赔累，例如：以较低价格供给他们的一些迫切需要的日用必需品（如食盐、茶叶）；用稳步前进的办法来帮助他们推销土产；从收购中逐渐帮助他们提高质量；建立较多的国营贸易机构与流动小组，来维持对他们的供应
    （这些国营贸易机构有时是入不敷出的）等。国营贸易机构采取这些办法，其目的是为了在一定时期内，帮助这些地区的少数民族得以恢复元气，发展生产，找到销路，逐渐建立他们自己的合作社和商业，这是为了帮助他们克服困难的过渡办法，而不是长期的以赔累和贴补为方针。各大行政区人民政府贸易部得根据本区的具体情况来决定是否需要这种特殊的照顾，与由于这种照顾而必须的赔累数额，并列入本区的国营贸易财务计划之内。
    （三）在少数民族地区的国营贸易企业必须在各地人民政府统一的领导下，与各经济部门（工业、农业、银行、税收、合作、交通）及有关各项工作密切结合，贯彻政策，并依靠群众，特别是在边防地区与保卫部门结合，更为重要。
    （四）为了加强对少数民族贸易工作的领导与帮助，各大行政区人民政府贸易部，省人民政府商业厅（工商厅），应根据需要建立民族贸易的专管机构，或设专管干部，以便具体研究指导工作的进行。
    （五）在商品经营上，要注意地方需要之具体情况，如医药用品、生产工具等。
    以上各点，是否有当，请政务院批准、指示！
