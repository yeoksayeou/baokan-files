	Experiences in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy at a Certain Smelting Plant in Northeast China
	He Li

	A certain smelting plant in Northeast China, which was once praised by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee as a "new direction for new records," has once again taken the lead in completing a huge task of increasing production and practicing economy in this Northeast state-owned enterprise's campaign. The Northeast smelting plant originally planned to increase production and practice economy, creating wealth equivalent to 115,976 tons of grain, equivalent to forty-nine fighter planes. By the end of September, the figure completed had reached 101.7 percent of the original plan. In order to continue to tap the potential in production, they held another workers' representative conference on October 15th, calling on all employees to further increase production and practice economy, creating wealth equivalent to 32,064 tons of grain this year. After the completion of this plan, the total for the year will be 148,040 tons, approximately equivalent to sixty-three fighter planes.
	Why is the Northeast smelting plant able to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy so quickly? Its experiences can be summarized in three points:
	1. Mobilize the masses and raise the political awareness of workers.
	In May, Comrade Gao Gang, at the Northeast Bureau urban work conference, put forward the call to increase production and practice economy for the country, creating wealth equivalent to five million tons of grain; at the same time, Northeast state-owned industries began to conduct quality inspections. In order to conduct extensive political mobilization and raise the awareness of workers and technicians, the leading cadres of a certain smelting plant, according to the spirit of the urban work conference, held a symposium of more than 200 technicians, veteran skilled workers, and young active workers. These personnel were the backbone of the entire plant. The purpose of holding this meeting was to improve the integration of technology and labor. In addition to discussing the political significance of the five million tons of grain increase in production and economy and quality inspection, several typical reports were organized. One was by technician Wang Jia-yi, introducing how he learned Guo Waliyev's method (i.e., the method of synthesizing advanced experience), explored advanced experience among workers, and concentrated it, scientifically analyzed it, and made operating procedures; the other was by veteran skilled worker Jia Feng-shan, introducing how he combined with technicians to improve technical theory, and he was promoted to technician. Through these typical introductions, technicians realized that labor is the foundation of theory and must be combined with workers; at the same time, workers also realized that only by learning theory can they improve their skills. The meeting also solved the "guest" mentality of some technicians. For example, Li Zu-you said: "I didn't consider myself a member of the working class before, but now I feel that I am also a master." Since this meeting, a series of activist meetings for technicians, skilled workers, and young workers have been held separately, and then extensive discussions have been launched among the masses. Their method is "calculate big accounts to raise awareness, calculate small accounts to increase confidence." The so-called calculation of big accounts is to calculate how many planes and cannons can be bought with the value of five million tons of grain to defend the country, and how many factories can be established to improve industrial and agricultural production. The so-called calculation of small accounts is to study how to tap potential in their own jobs, how much production can be increased through improvements, and how much wealth can be saved by eliminating waste. After this calculation, the workers' awareness was greatly improved, and they also felt that there were ways to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. For example, when many workers calculated that their own increased production and economy of more than 115,000 tons of grain could buy forty-nine fighter planes, or fifteen bombers, or thirty tanks, or ninety-two anti-aircraft guns, everyone felt that their contribution to the country was significant, and they were very excited. Copper electrolysis worker Feng De-sen calculated the accounts of his workshop and happily said: "The harvest from increasing production and practicing economy in our workshop can buy a cannon and still have some left over. Give this cannon to the Chinese People's Volunteers, and see if the American devils dare to be fierce! We shout 'Resist America, Aid Korea' every day, isn't this resisting America and aiding Korea?" The political awareness of the masses has become the basic driving force for the plant's campaign to increase production and practice economy.
	2. Calculate detailed accounts for everything and find the direction for tapping potential.
	The production equipment capacity of the smelting plant is very high, but due to the limitation of raw materials and equipment imbalance, it is currently unable to develop production in large quantities. The largest part of the product cost of this plant is raw materials (mineral sand), accounting for about 80-90% of the cost. The loss of these raw materials in the production process is very large. There is a tall chimney in the smelting plant, and hundreds of tons of metal have been scattered through this chimney in the first half of the year. According to the analysis in the first half of the year, the coal slag of the plant also contains less than 0.4% copper and about 1% lead. The direct recovery rate of each workshop is not high. For example, the direct recovery rate of the converter is 75%, the direct recovery rate of the reverberatory furnace is 70%, and the direct recovery rate of zinc oxide is only 40%. Although the metal in the slag of these workshops can still be recovered, the higher the processing, the greater the loss and the higher the cost. Therefore, improving the direct recovery rate is the central issue of the whole plant. This is the main direction for the plant to tap its potential. Because improving the direct recovery rate can both increase production and reduce costs.
	In order to prevent smoke from escaping, each workshop has developed many methods. In the smelting process, the most smoke escapes from the roasting furnace. When the quality inspection started in July, Wang Jia-yi, the technician of the roasting furnace, proposed to reduce the burning loss rate ("burning loss" means that many mineral powders are lost due to turning into smoke and dust when the ore is not roasted). The burning loss rate of this workshop is generally around 13-14%. This means that 13-14 tons of 100 tons of ore are lost due to roasting. In order to reduce the burning loss rate, the entire workshop conducted a serious struggle. Wang Jia-yi invited many veteran skilled workers, activists, technical section engineers, and Party, administrative, and trade union cadres of the roasting workshop to organize a special research meeting to solve this problem. Wang Jia-yi found that the operation method of the C shift workers in this workshop was the best and the burning loss rate was the lowest, so he focused on the C shift and conducted experiments. Six operating methods were summarized successively, including batching, feeding, spraying water, and closing the flue. The promotion of these operating methods has generally reduced the burning loss rate to between 10% and 12%, and recovered metals worth about 800 tons of grain. The second is to reduce the loss of copper and lead in the slag. The copper blast furnace slag originally contained 0.36% copper. This plan is to add iron sulfide (pyrite) to the front bed to decompose the copper in the slag, so that the copper content of the slag is reduced to 0.3%. Now, they are even more determined to move towards the international standard of 0.2%. The workers of the lead blast furnace also came up with ways to strengthen the precipitation effect and implement the method of frequent slag removal to increase the direct recovery rate by 1.2%. The most significant results in improving the direct recovery rate were achieved in the converter and reverberatory furnace. The reverberatory furnace began to produce refined copper last year, but the direct recovery rate was very low. Before May, the direct recovery rate of copper was only about 70%. Zinc oxide was only 40%. Since May, the technician of this furnace accidentally saw the workers mixing slag in the coal, and after research, came up with the method of reducing with coal (with the help of Soviet experts, coke has been used instead), which greatly reduced the reverberatory furnace slag. Due to the continued improvement of other operating methods, the direct recovery rate of copper has now increased to 90%. Zinc oxide has increased to 70-80%. Chen Lian-gao (a veteran worker, currently the section chief) in the converter workshop came up with a method of timely processing high-grade slag, which increased the direct recovery rate of the converter to more than 80%.
	In addition to improving the direct recovery rate, the second important direction for tapping potential is to improve quality and eliminate waste products. According to the electrolytic equipment of the smelting plant, the quality of several major products after electrolytic refining is generally good. However, electrolytic copper often forms nodules, and electrolytic lead has not reached international standards. In particular, the quality of some semi-finished products is not high, and waste products often occur. At this time, the whole plant organized a quality exhibition, displaying the standard products and waste products of each workshop (there were as many as 90 kinds of waste products), and the technicians explained the reasons for the waste products to the workers. This exhibition made many workers sad about the waste. Therefore, each workshop launched discussions, found out the problems, studied methods, and improved many products. The most important of these is the production of refined copper in the converter, which was originally proposed by Soviet expert Comrade Shablin. Under the guidance of Comrade Shablin, the head of the technical section sent technicians and technicians and workers from the converter workshop to conduct joint research, and after many experiments, completed the task of refining copper. This generally increased the quality of copper to 99%. The improved quality also reduced the loss of returning some crude copper with poor quality for reprocessing in the past.
	The third is the saving of general materials and consumables, which is one of the important methods to reduce costs. The number of saving methods proposed by the workers cannot but be surprising. Here, only the auxiliary department—the repair department—is mentioned to illustrate this problem. The repair department is not a direct production department, and the leaders of the plant did not initially assign them the task of increasing production and practicing economy. The director of the repair department and the branch secretary initially did not have much confidence in increasing production and practicing economy. Later, they led the workers in each workshop to calculate detailed accounts and proposed to increase production and save three kilograms of grain per person per day. In the discussion, mason Wei Chang-heng first proposed that in the past, when repairing furnaces and houses, bricks were not selected. When broken bricks should be used, broken bricks were not picked up, and large bricks were broken, which wasted a lot; in the future, small bricks should be used instead of large bricks. Another worker also reviewed: in the past, bricks and tiles were carried too heavily, and some were broken. In the future, handling them gently and carefully will not damage the bricks, and 33 kilograms of grain can be saved every day. After general discussion, it was decided that the entire repair department would save an average of 30 kilograms of grain per person per day. When awarding prizes in early October, the repair department had already won a red flag because all aspects were good. This shows that as long as there are workers working, there is the possibility of increasing production and practicing economy.
	In addition to savings in production, there have also been great achievements in savings in working capital. The accumulation of working capital in this factory was very serious last year, with a turnover period of 201 days. The biggest problem was in the general materials in the reserve funds; the second was in finished products and semi-finished products. In order to shorten the turnover period of working capital, the plant specially ran a short-term working capital training class in August and September. The finance section also sent people to the workshops to promote, requiring that semi-finished products not be accumulated and that material requisition budgets be accurate. After the materials section received the material notification forms from each workshop, it sent people to the material requisitioning units to understand the specific needs for all items worth more than 500,000 yuan, and then purchased them, which reduced the September budget by 21%. The materials section also printed the stagnant materials into a catalog and distributed it to the relevant departments for national balanced sales. Although the results of handling stagnant materials are not yet significant, new accumulation has been prevented. The best performance was in the handling of finished product funds. The balance at the end of September was only 5.7 days of reserves (the quota is 30 days). The reason is that their finished products have designated sales channels and have order contracts. As long as they grasp the contracts, they can solve the problem. Everyone knows that product accumulation will also affect the turnover of working capital, so they take it seriously and stipulate that the implementation of the contract will be checked every three days. Seven days before the goods are picked up, a pick-up notice will be issued to notify the buyer to pick up the goods on time. For the excess production beyond the contract and the products that are not controlled by the state every month, ways are found in advance to contact buyers and sell them on a ten-day basis (previously they were sold on a monthly basis). In this way, not only is the turnover period of product funds shortened, but also the currency circulation is accelerated, and the credit from the bank is reduced a lot. The interest saved in October was 15 million yuan compared to September. In the past, they were afraid that the turnover of funds would be unsmooth, and they kept a large amount of currency in their hands; now, very little currency is left over at the end of each month, and more than 5 billion yuan of currency was returned to the state in August alone.
	3. Order production plans, collective contracts, patriotic covenants, and contact contracts.
	In order to ensure the realization of the task of increasing production and practicing economy, the smelting plant has adopted several methods of organizing production:
	The first is to order a plan. From top to bottom, they have formulated a series of plans based on the potential they have discovered. Before launching the production and economy campaign, the factory director first made a plan for the entire factory. The factory director's plan is based on the results of increasing production and practicing economy in the first half of the year, and on the technical measures plan (such as improving the direct recovery rate) and financial measures plan (such as reducing costs and shortening working capital) formulated in the second half of the year. However, because this plan has not been widely discussed by the masses, many potentials cannot be estimated. Therefore, after ordering the general plan, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to discuss, so that each workshop, group, and even individual can order their own plans. The factory ordered individual plans for 80% of the factory's employees. The plan points out the way to further explore potential.
	After formulating the plan, they adopted two guarantee measures, one is a collective contract, and the other is a patriotic covenant. The first article of the contract stipulates: "The entire production plan is the production task that must be guaranteed to be completed during the contract period." The guarantee is divided into two aspects. The first is administrative guarantee. In the guarantee items, on the one hand, the production matters and responsibilities of the factory and its affiliated sections and workshops are specified in detail, such as stipulating that the planning section should continue to strengthen the planning, organization, and discipline of production, and put forward rationalization proposals on labor organization and eliminating absenteeism and disconnection; stipulating that the technical section should assist each workshop in improving the metal recovery rate, improving product quality, and striving to complete the main technical and economic quotas in the second half of the year; stipulating that the finance section should accelerate the turnover of working capital, reduce costs, and improve product management and sales. On the other hand, it also stipulates the improvement of employee welfare on the basis of completing production tasks. Such as building a spare-time sanatorium with 80 beds; solving the dormitory problem for 120 employee and family households; issuing employees with necessary cotton clothes, work aprons, rubber shoes, and colored glasses. The trade union also guarantees to mobilize the masses, strengthen worker unity, and organize all employees with patriotic covenants to carry out patriotic production competitions. Finally, the method of rewards and punishments is stipulated. In this way, everyone recognizes their responsibilities. However, the responsibility for implementing this collective contract mainly lies with the main cadres of each department. In order to implement the spirit of the contract to each group and each individual, they handed the collective contract to the workers for discussion, and revised the patriotic covenant on the basis of the original groups. In the past, this kind of patriotic covenant was mostly drafted by the superiors, which was unrealistic, and the masses did not implement it, "ordering is ordering, doing is doing, two different things." This time, after calculating the big and small accounts, the masses' awareness was raised, and the revised patriotic covenant has rich content. The patriotic covenants of each section and workshop group are centered on increasing production and practicing economy. Because the covenant has been fully discussed by the masses, the masses supervise each other's implementation of the covenant. This has become a very good guarantee form. For example, after studying the group's methods for increasing production and practicing economy, the tuyere group of the copper blast furnace stipulated in the patriotic covenant that they should do a good job in three preventions: 1. Prevent air from escaping (so as not to weaken the wind force and blow away the metal), 2. Prevent the tuyere from turning black (because the tuyere turns black, it will reduce the furnace temperature), 3. Prevent poor air supply (because poor air supply will make the smelting bad). This kind of patriotic covenant really serves to increase production and practice economy.
	In addition to collective contracts and patriotic covenants, there is also an auxiliary form, which is a contact contract. The role of the contact contract is to connect the work of each workshop with each other. Because it is a流水式作业, if the work of the previous workshop is done in a timely manner, the next workshop will not be in a hurry. If the products produced in the previous workshop are good, the work in the next workshop will be smooth. The mutual influence and involvement is very great. This contract is like a link that tightly connects everyone.
	These production plans, collective contracts, patriotic covenants, and contact contracts are like countless clues, organizing everyone. Adding random inspections and awards makes their patriotic production and economy competition able to develop forward with goals and order.

    东北某冶炼厂的增产节约经验
    贺笠
    曾被中共中央东北局表扬为“新纪录的新方向”的东北某冶炼厂，在这次东北国营企业的增产节约运动中，又捷足先登地完成了巨额的增产节约任务。东北某冶炼厂原来计划增产节约价值十一万五千九百七十六吨粮食的财富，相当于四十九架战斗机。到九月底所完成的数字，已达原计划的百分之一百点七。他们为继续发挥生产中的潜力，在十月十五日又召开了一次职工代表大会，号召全体职工今年再增加增产节约价值三万二千零六十四吨粮食的财富。这个计划完成后，全年共计十四万八千零四十吨，大约相当于战斗机六十三架。
    东北某冶炼厂为什么能这样快地完成增产节约任务呢？它的经验概括起来有三点：
    一、发动群众，提高工人政治觉悟。
    五月间，高岗同志在东北局城市工作会议提出为国家增产节约价值五百万吨粮食的财富的号召；同时，东北国营工业开始进行质量检查。某冶炼厂的领导干部为进行广泛的政治动员，提高工人、技术人员的觉悟，便根据城市工作会议的精神，召开了二百余人的技术人员、老技工、青年积极工人的座谈会。这些人员是全厂的骨干。召开这个会议的目的是要搞好技术和劳动结合的问题。会上除了讨论五百万吨粮食增产节约及质量检查的政治意义外，并组织了几个典型报告。一个是技术员王家一介绍他怎样学习郭瓦廖夫的方法（即综合先进经验的方法），发掘工人中的先进经验，并把它集中起来，加以科学的分析，制成操作规程；另一个是老技工贾凤山，介绍他怎样和技术员结合，提高了技术理论，自己被提拔为技术员。经过这些典型介绍，使技术人员知道劳动才是理论的基础，必须和工人结合；同时，也使工人知道：只有学习理论才能提高技术。会上并解决了某些技术员的“作客”思想。如李祖佑就这样地说：“从前不把自己当做工人阶级的一分子，现在才感到自己也是主人。”自从这次会议之后，又分别开了技术人员、技工、青工等一系列的积极分子会议，然后在群众中展开广泛讨论。他们的办法是“算大账提高觉悟，算小账提高信心”。所谓算大账就是计算五百万吨粮食的价值可买多少飞机大炮来保卫国家，可以创办多少工厂，提高工业和农业生产。所谓算小账就是研究如何在自己工作岗位上发掘潜在力，那些地方经过改进，可以提高多少生产；那些地方有浪费，消灭了浪费可以节约多少财富。这样一算，工人觉悟大大提高了，自己也觉得有办法来完成增产节约任务了。比方当许多工友算了算他们自己增产节约十一万五千多吨粮食可买四十九架战斗机、或买十五架轰炸机、或买三十辆坦克、或买九十二门高射炮之后，每一个人都感到自己对国家贡献的重大，情绪很兴奋。铜电解工人冯德森算了算自己车间的账，就高兴地说：“咱们车间增产节约的收获，可以买一门大炮还有余。把这门大炮送给人民志愿军，你看美国鬼子还敢行凶！咱们天天喊抗美援朝，这不就是抗美援朝吗？”群众的政治觉悟成了该厂增产节约运动的基本动力。
    二、事事算细账，找出发掘潜力的方向。
    某冶炼厂的生产设备能力很高，但由于原料的限制和设备不平衡，目前还不能大量发展生产。这个厂占产品成本最大的是原料（矿砂），约占成本的百分之八、九十。这些原料在生产过程中的损耗很大。某冶炼厂有一个高大的烟突，今年上半年通过这个烟突飞散的金属，就有几百吨。据上半年的分析，这个厂的煤渣里，也含有百分之零点四以下的铜和百分之一左右的铅。各个车间的直接实收率是不高的。例如，真吹炉的实收率是百分之七十五，反射炉的实收率是百分之七十，氧化锌实收率仅百分之四十。这些车间的渣滓中的金属虽然还可回收，但加工愈高，损耗愈大，成本也就愈大。因而，提高实收率是全厂的中心问题。这就是这个厂发挥潜力的主要方向。因为提高实收率，既可增加产量，又可降低成本。
    为了防止跑烟，各车间研究出许多办法。在熔炼过程中跑烟最多的，要算焙烧炉。七月开始质量检查时，焙烧炉的技术员王家一就提出降低烧减率（“烧减”是矿石没有经过焙烧时，许多矿粉就因变成烟尘而跑掉了的意思）。这个车间的烧减率，一般都在百分之十三、四左右。这就是说，一百吨矿石就有十三、四吨因焙烧而遭到损失。为了降低烧减率，全车间进行了严重的斗争。王家一邀请了许多老技工、积极分子、技术科工程师，和焙烧车间党、行政、工会干部，组织了专题研究会，专门解决这个问题。王家一发现这个车间的丙班工友的操作方法最好，烧减率最低，于是就以丙班为重点，进行实验。先后总结了配料、进料、喷水、关烟道等六条操作方法。推广这些操作方法，使烧减率普遍降低到百分之十至十二之间，收回的金属约值粮食八百吨。其次是减少渣滓里的含铜、含铅的损失。铜鼓风炉渣原来含铜百分之零点三六，这次计划在前床加硫化铁（黄铁矿）以分解渣里的铜，使渣含铜降低到零点三。现在，他们更决心向国际标准零点二迈进。铅鼓风炉的工人也想法加强沉淀作用，实行勤倒渣的办法，提高实收率百分之一点二。提高直接实收率成绩最显著的是真吹炉和反射炉。反射炉去年就开始出精铜，但实收率很低。在五月以前，铜实收率仅百分之七十左右。氧化锌只百分之四十。自五月开始，这个炉的技术员偶然看到工人在煤中掺渣，经过研究，想出用煤还元的办法（经苏联专家的帮助，已改用焦炭），使反射炉渣滓大大减少。由于继续改进了其他方面的操作方法，现在铜实收率已增加到百分之九十。氧化锌提高到百分之七十至八十。真吹车间由于陈连高（老工人，现任股长）想出及时处理高品位炉渣的方法，使真吹炉的直接实收率提高到百分之八十以上。
    除了提高实收率之外，第二个重要的发掘潜力的方向，就是提高质量，消灭废品。按照某冶炼厂的电解设备，几种主要产品经过电解精炼，一般的质量还不错。但电铜常起圪塔，电铅也没有达到国际标准。特别是有些半制品质量不高，还常常出废品。这时全厂便组织质量展览，把各车间的标准品与废品都陈列出来（其中废品有九十种之多），并由技术员向工人解释出废品的原因。这个展览，使许多工友都因浪费而难过。于是各车间都展开讨论，找出毛病，研究办法，改进了许多产品。其中最重要的是真吹炉出精铜，这原是苏联专家沙布林同志提出的。在沙布林同志指导下，技术科长派技术员和真吹车间技术员、工人共同研究，经过多次试验，完成了炼精铜的任务。这样使铜的质量一般都提高到百分之九十九。质量提高了，也就减少了过去因有些粗铜质量太劣返回重炼的损失。
    第三是一般材料和消耗材料的节约，这是降低成本的重要方法之一。工人们提出节省方法之多，不能不使人感到惊异。这里只提出一个辅助部门——修理部来说明这个问题。修理部并不是直接生产部门，厂的领导方面起初也没有分给他们增产节约任务。修理部主任和支部书记起初对增产节约也没多大信心。后来他们领导各车间工人算细账，提出每人每天增产节约三斤粮食。在讨论中，瓦工魏长恒首先就提出过去修炉修房用砖没有选择，该用碎砖的时候不去拣碎砖，把大砖打碎，这就浪费不少；今后该用小砖的就不用大砖。另一个工友也检讨：过去搬运砖瓦放得太重，有些就摔烂了。今后轻拿轻放，不损失砖，每天就可节省三十三公斤粮食。经过普遍讨论之后，就确定全修理部每人每天平均节省粮食三十斤。十月初评奖时，修理部因为各方面都好，已经赢得一面红旗。这说明只要有工人劳动的地方，就有增产节约的可能。
    除了生产方面的节约之外，在流动资金方面的节约，也有很大的成绩。这个工厂去年流动资金的积压很厉害，周转期为二百零一天。其中问题最大的是储备资金中的一般材料；其次是成品、半成品等。为了缩短流动资金周转期，这个厂在八、九月间特别开办了短期的流动资金训练班。财务科并派员深入车间宣传，要求不积压半成品，领用材料预算要准确。材料科得到各车间的材料通知单后，凡价值超过五十万元以上的，就派人到领料的单位去了解具体需要量，然后采购，这样使九月份的预算减低了百分之二十一。材料科并且把呆滞材料印成目录分发有关部门，由国家平衡推销。虽然目前呆滞材料处理的成绩还不大，但是已防止了新的积压现象。办得最好的是处理成品资金，到九月份结存，只有五点七天的储备量了（定额是三十天）。原因是他们的成品都有指定的销路，订有订货合同，只要抓紧合同，就能解决问题。大家知道了产品积压也会影响到流动资金周转，都认真起来，规定三天检查一次合同执行情况，在提货前七天，就开提货通知单，通知买方按期提货。每月在合同以外的超产部分和不是国家控制的产品，都事先想办法联系买主，按旬推销（过去是按月推销）。这样，不仅产品资金周转期缩短，而且货币流通也加速了，对银行的信贷减少很多，十月份比九月份节省出利息一千五百万元。过去害怕资金周转不灵，手里存积着大量的货币；现在每月结存的货币很少，光八月份就把五十多亿元货币交回国家了。
    三、订生产计划、集体合同、爱国公约、联系合同。
    为了保证增产节约任务的实现，某冶炼厂采取了几种组织生产的办法：
    首先是订计划。他们自上而下都根据发掘出来的潜力制定了一系列的计划。在发动生产节约运动之前，首先由厂长作出全厂的计划。厂长的计划一方面是根据上半年增产节约的成果，另一方面是根据下半年拟定的技术措施计划（如提高实收率）和财务措施计划（如降低成本、缩短流动资金等）制定的。但是由于这个计划没有经过群众广泛的讨论，还有许多潜力是不可能估计到的。因此，订出总的计划后，必须发动群众讨论，使各车间、小组一直到个人都订出自己的计划。这个厂订个人计划的就占全厂职工百分之八十。计划为进一步发掘潜力指出了途径。
    在制订计划之后，他们又采取了两种保证办法，一是集体合同，一是爱国公约。合同的第一条就规定：“全部的生产计划是合同期间必须保证完成的生产任务。”保证分两方面。第一是行政保证。在保证事项中，一方面详细规定了厂部及所属各科各车间的生产事项及责任，如规定计划科要继续加强生产的计划性、组织性、纪律性，及时提出有关劳动组织及消灭窝工脱节现象的合理化建议等；规定技术科要协助各车间提高金属实收率，改善产品质量，争取完成下半年主要技术经济定额等；规定财务科要加速流动资金周转、降低成本及改善产品管理推销等。另一方面，又规定了在完成生产任务的基础上改善职工福利。像修建八十个床位的业余疗养院一座；解决职工和家属一百二十户的宿舍问题；发给职工必需的棉衣、工作用的围裙、胶皮鞋、颜色眼镜等。在工会方面也保证发动群众，加强工人团结，用爱国公约把全体职工都组织起来，开展爱国主义生产竞赛等。最末还规定了奖惩的办法。这样一来，使大家都认清了自己的责任。但是，执行这种集体合同的责任，主要还是在各部门的主要干部身上。为了把合同精神贯彻到各个小组各个人，他们又把集体合同交给工人讨论，并在各小组原有的基础上修订爱国公约。这种爱国公约过去多是由上级包办拟定的，不切实际，群众也不执行，“订是订，干是干，两码事”。这次经过算大账、小账之后，群众觉悟提高了，修订爱国公约就具有丰富的内容。各科、各车间小组的爱国公约都以增产节约为中心。因为公约是经过群众充分讨论的，群众对于公约都是互相监督执行。这就成为很好的保证形式。如铜鼓风炉风口小组研究了本组增产节约办法后，就在爱国公约中规定要作好三防工作：一、防跑空风（以免减弱风力，并吹跑金属），二、防风口发黑（因风口发黑，就会降低炉温），三、防送风不良（因送风不良，就会使熔炼不好）。这样的爱国公约真正是为增产节约服务了。
    除了集体合同和爱国公约之外，还有一种辅助形式，就是联系合同。联系合同的作用是使各车间的工作互相衔接。因为是流水式的作业，上一个车间的工作做得及时，下一个车间才不至于手忙脚乱。上一个车间出的产品好，下一个车间工作起来就顺利。互相影响牵连是很大的。这个合同就像纽带一样把大家紧密联结起来。
    这些生产计划、集体合同、爱国公约、联系合同就好像无数条线索，把大家都组织起来。加以随时检查评奖，就使他们的爱国增产节约竞赛能够有目标有秩序地向前发展。
