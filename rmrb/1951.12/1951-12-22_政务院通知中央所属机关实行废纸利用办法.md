    Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: In order to increase production and practice economy, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has formulated the "Trial Measures for the Implementation of Waste Paper Recycling by Various Organs of the Central People's Government," and has notified the general offices of the central government organs to earnestly implement them. The measures stipulate that waste paper from various organs of the Central People's Government, except for those that must be incinerated, should generally be incinerated as little as possible or not at all, and should be uniformly sent to the designated Beijing Yanjing Paper Mill for recycling into paper pulp as a raw material for papermaking. Each organ should form a waste paper utilization team to be responsible for the collection, storage, inspection, transportation, and supervision of the dissolving of waste paper into paper pulp. Each organ should, in accordance with the paper mill's regulations, clean the waste paper of impurities, tear it up, mix it, pack it, seal it, mark its weight, and send it to the paper mill. Among them, confidential waste paper should be inspected, sealed, and escorted to the factory by reliable personnel. It should be dissolved immediately upon arrival and no one is allowed to read it; when dissolving the pulp, the original sending organ should send a special person to supervise until it becomes paper pulp before leaving. Each organ should take into account confidentiality and the requirements of the paper mill when handling waste paper, but it must simplify internal procedures as much as possible, and mobilize the enthusiasm of staff to do it themselves, but it should be done in their spare time to avoid hindering work or encroaching on study time. The proceeds from the sale of waste paper by each department should be used for extra-budgetary expenditures or to offset budgetary overruns, and should not be regarded as extra income to be spent arbitrarily. Organs with large waste paper revenues may extract a portion as welfare subsidies, relief funds, or bonuses for cadres. Specific measures shall be formulated by each organ. The Yanjing Paper Mill has already formulated measures for the purchase of waste paper based on the regulations of the Government Administration Council. In order to protect the safety of the machines, the factory stipulates that impurities such as pins, paper clips, staples, oil paper, tin foil, wax paper, carbon paper, cloth scraps, wood chips, and matchboxes contained in the waste paper should be cleaned and selected by each organ itself. In order to facilitate everyone, the factory has set up a waste paper purchasing team and assigned a special person to be responsible.

    政务院通知中央所属机关实行废纸利用办法
     【新华社二十一日讯】为了增产节约，中央人民政府政务院特制定“中央人民政府各机关实行废纸利用的试行办法”，已通知中央所属各机关办公厅切实执行。办法规定中央人民政府各机关的废纸，除必须焚毁者外，一般应尽量少焚毁或不焚毁，统一送交指定的北京燕京造纸厂利用回造纸浆，作为造纸原料。各机关应组成废纸利用小组，负责废纸的收集、保管、检验、运送、监督溶成纸浆等工作。各机关应按照造纸厂的规定，将废纸检净杂物，撕碎搅和，打包、加封、标明重量，送交纸厂。其中机密废纸应检好封存，派可靠人员押送到厂，随到随溶，不准停留，任何人不得翻阅；溶浆时，原送机关应派专人监督，直至变成纸浆后，始得离开。各机关对于处理废纸工作应照顾保密与造纸厂的要求，但必须尽量简化内部手续，并应发动工作人员的积极性，大家动手来做，但应利用空暇，避免妨害工作或侵占学习的时间。各部门对所得废纸价款，应作预算外支出或抵补预算超支部分之用，不得视为额外收入，任意支用。废纸价款收入较多者，得抽出若干，作为干部福利补助、救济金或奖金。具体办法，由各机关自行订定。燕京造纸厂业已根据政务院的规定制定出收购废纸的办法。为了保护机器的安全，该厂规定废纸内夹有的大头针，曲别针，书钉，油纸，锡纸，腊纸，复写纸，布皮，木屑，火柴盒等杂物应由各机关自己负责检选干净。为了照顾大家的方便，该厂已设废纸收购组，指定专人负责。
