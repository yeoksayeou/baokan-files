During the Three Great Movements, I lost my Party stance, shielded a counter-revolutionary, and undermined land reform, causing great losses to the Party and the people. What is especially serious is that the Party patiently educated me, but I still could not quickly recognize all my mistakes and continued to defend them. The reason I committed such a series of serious errors is that I did not ideologically join the Party and still had strong landlord class and petty-bourgeois consciousness.

I came from a landlord family and received a long period of feudalist and capitalist education. Although I came into contact with the revolution in my teens, I did not study hard and did not truly understand the principles of the revolution; I only had superficial sympathy for the working class and no deep love; I only had superficial hatred for the exploiting class and no intense hatred. After joining the Party in 1948, I still did not thoroughly examine my thoughts and completely eliminate those reactionary and erroneous elements. Therefore, when revolutionary interests and my own interests conflicted, I began to waver in my stance and my views became blurred; then I lost my Party stance; and finally, I engaged in shielding counter-revolutionary behavior.

Before liberation, when I learned that Yu Dingchuan had joined the Kuomintang and served as a puppet county councilor and puppet county council speaker, I only thought that he was completely ruining his personal future by degenerating in this way; but I did not analyze the root cause of his degeneration, and I did not recognize the harm he posed to the revolution. I still regarded him as a "companion who had gone astray," but I did not realize that he was already an enemy of the people.

After liberation, I still extremely wrongly believed that he was a counter-revolutionary with "minor crimes," thinking that he could still be reformed and renewed. I single-mindedly considered his personal future, completely forgetting the interests of the revolution; I repeatedly wanted him to come to Beijing to study and work, forgetting that he was a member of a reactionary party group and that his crimes should be settled by the local people. Because I became a prisoner of the landlord counter-revolutionaries in my thinking, his insults to local cadres did not arouse my anger. I did not regard them as counter-revolutionary remarks, but as "deviations" that were indeed true.

Because I stood on Yu Dingchuan's side, not on the side of the Party and the people, when I learned of his arrest, I first shielded him in my mind, wrongly believing that his crimes were not serious enough to warrant arrest. Not only did I not recognize his reactionary nature from a class perspective, but I also thought, without any class consciousness, that his "character" and "behavior" were not bad. Not only did I not believe in the measures of the local Party and government, but I believed his own lies about "not doing evil." Not only did I not think that his becoming a "gentleman" was the result of collusion between the landlord and the Kuomintang, but I thought it was because he had done some good for the local "people." Not only did I not analyze his thoughts after liberation and recognize that his reactionary nature had not changed, but I thought that he was sincerely reforming and renewing himself. His unwillingness to leave his hometown was basically because he was reluctant to give up his family property, but I excused him, thinking that he was "innocent" and did not want to be regarded as a fleeing landlord. Because of these extremely wrong understandings, I suspected that the local cadres had "deviations" and feared that his arrest might have been "unjust."

Since I had these shielding thoughts, and at the same time was extremely arrogant, conceited, and lacking in organization and discipline, I did not report to the branch or ask for instructions, nor did I consult with anyone, but wrote a letter to the village government, stating my opinions. At that time, I thought I was standing firm on the Party's stance, providing my opinions to the village government for "reference," but in fact, I was standing entirely on the counter-revolutionary's stance, hoping to achieve the goal of releasing the counter-revolutionary. Therefore, wherever it was beneficial to the counter-revolutionary, I exaggeratedly narrated it, and wherever it was unfavorable to the counter-revolutionary, I lightly passed it over. In the letter, I also revealed my position and Party membership, indicating that I was superior to the responsible comrades of the village government, giving them a kind of threat, making them value my opinions, which was to leniently treat the counter-revolutionary. If I had truly stood on the Party's stance at that time, I should have felt happy about the arrest of this puppet county council speaker and hoped that the village government would earnestly eliminate the harm for the people.

A few days later, I saw a letter from Yu Changhua, saying that the land reform work team was "arresting and beating people indiscriminately" and complaining about Yu Dingchuan's arrest, asking me to "save the vast masses of my hometown." I had already ideologically stood with the landlord counter-revolutionaries, and these words were in line with my thinking, so I thought that the land reform work team really had "leftist" "deviations." Not only did I not think that Yu Changhua was a lackey of the landlord counter-revolutionaries, but I thought he was an excellent cadre. Therefore, I reversed right and wrong, regarding the land reform work team as "left-leaning adventurists" and the enemy's lackey as a "revolutionary cadre," so Yu Changhua's insults to the land reform work team did not stimulate my emotions, and I did not infer his intentions from these insults. The reason why such a serious error occurred was precisely because the lackey's reflections conformed to Yu Dingchuan's interests, while the measures of the land reform work team contradicted his interests. I reported the situation to the Party organization, on the one hand, hoping to correct the so-called general "deviations," and on the other hand, hoping to seek Yu Dingchuan's release in the so-called "correction," achieving the goal of shielding him. In the report to the Party organization, I did not mention the arrest of Yu Dingchuan, ostensibly to avoid shielding him, but in fact, precisely to shield him, because if I mentioned my brother, the Party organization would be suspicious and might not investigate or "correct the deviations." My incomplete reflection was being dishonest to the Party and deceiving the Party.

In my letter to the county magistrate, in addition to repeating the various serious errors in my letter to the village government, I further defended Yu Dingchuan's selling of his house. I had not investigated this matter, but only relied on what Yu Dingchuan told me to excuse him. This was another manifestation of my losing my stance, not believing in cadres but believing in counter-revolutionary elements.

In late April, I learned that Yu Dingchuan had been executed. Although I thought that "after a long investigation, there was probably no injustice," I did not feel happy because a chief culprit had been eliminated. If I had abandoned the landlord counter-revolutionary stance and stood on the Party's stance, I should have rejoiced at the execution of a counter-revolutionary chief culprit.

When I learned of his execution, I initially realized that I had made a mistake. At that time, I thought: I didn't understand his situation well enough, why did I write to Nanling so rashly? I was so naive to think that he was very honest with me, but he even concealed the matter of being the "Director of the Pacification Committee" from me, but I still shielded him emotionally, without analyzing his reactionary nature, so I only felt that he was "hateful," and only regretted that I shouldn't have believed him too much and interfered in his affairs, but I didn't hate him as an enemy of the people. Although I had some awareness of my mistakes, I didn't realize their seriousness. I didn't recognize that this was a fundamental error of losing my stance, but only thought it was an ordinary "speaking recklessly without understanding the situation," because I hadn't stood on the Party's stance to recognize this error. Also, because I was extremely arrogant and afraid of losing face, I didn't report my mistakes to the organization, only wanting to secretly correct this "rash" attitude and be more vigilant in the future. This was another dishonest attitude towards the Party. When Comrade Wang Zhicheng, with the instructions of Comrade Liu Ren, asked me to hand over the draft of my so-called reflections of the situation to the Party organization, I still didn't realize it, and didn't mention the matter of writing to Nanling, which was even more intentional to conceal my mistakes from the Party.

In July, when Comrade Song Shuo asked me, I completely told the story of writing to Nanling and the fact that Yu Dingchuan had been executed. After I read the materials about him, I hated him for his bloody debts and many evil deeds, but I still shielded him in my mind, suspecting whether all the counter-revolutionary crimes in Nanling before liberation could be attributed to him. At that time, I already hated him, thinking that he should indeed be executed, but I felt that letting go of the county magistrate and making him bear all the responsibility for the crime was somewhat "unfair" to him. Regarding the selling of the house, I still believed what he had said before and didn't believe the organization's materials. The reason why I was so stubborn was still because I hadn't left the landlord counter-revolutionary stance and recognized his counter-revolutionary nature; it was still because I didn't care about the interests of the people, but cared about the interests of the counter-revolutionaries.

The Party was very caring towards me. Comrade Liu Ren and Comrade Song Shuo repeatedly enlightened me to become self-aware, but because I was basically standing on the landlord counter-revolutionary stance, and I didn't have a concept of organization and discipline, was very arrogant, unwilling to expose mistakes, and unwilling to thoroughly examine mistakes, I couldn't recognize the seriousness of the mistakes in a timely manner, and truly awaken in a timely manner. After Comrade Wang Xuezhen and others talked to me twice, I initially realized the seriousness of the mistakes, but I didn't know how serious they were. After holding two group meetings and one branch meeting, the comrades put forward more opinions, which gave me greater help, and I had a further understanding of my mistakes. But the understanding of "shielding" was still very superficial, and I didn't dig into the roots from the depths of my thoughts and feelings. After listening to Comrade Wang Xuezhen's careful analysis at the Party member meeting, and then analyzing the purpose of writing the letter from the depths of my thoughts and feelings after the meeting, I realized that I had initially shielded the landlord counter-revolutionary subjectively, and even if I hadn't written a single letter, my thoughts and feelings were thoroughly shielding him. The reason why it was so difficult for me to recognize my mistakes was entirely because I didn't immediately leave Yu Dingchuan's stance, completely sever the feudal brotherly feelings, and stand on the Party's stance. Only by first standing firm on the Party's stance can we have the correct weapon and can we effectively expose our mistakes.

Due to my mistakes, the Party suffered great losses. First of all, it created a bad impression among the masses of people in Nanling, making the peasants doubt the Party and the People's Government. Secondly, it damaged the prestige of the local cadres, making them hesitant to deal with problems. Thirdly, it delayed the date of punishing counter-revolutionary elements. Fourthly, it brought a lot of trouble to the Party committees at all levels. Fifthly, it affected the work of the Municipal Educational Workers' Union. I feel extremely heartbroken and don't know how to compensate for such a great loss!

In summary, I made such serious mistakes because I had a strong landlord class consciousness and strong feudal feelings; because I had strong petty-bourgeois habits, being arrogant, undisciplined, and even treating my mistakes with a liberal attitude. I didn't let the interests of the individual be subordinate to the interests of the Party and the people, but wanted to make the interests of the Party and the people subordinate to the interests of the individual.

These reactionary and erroneous consciousnesses greatly hindered my progress, making me unable to become a communist. Although I usually noticed my shortcomings, I never treated them seriously and never examined them deeply. Therefore, at a critical moment, these shortcomings developed into the biggest and most serious mistakes. The Party's severe punishment not only purified the Party but also gave me a most profound education. I am determined to learn humbly from the beginning, be vigilant at all times, reflect at all times, truly stand firm on the Party's stance, and work hard to compensate for the losses I have caused to the Party and the people.

    关于包庇反革命首恶分子错误行为的自我检讨
    俞铭传
    在三大运动中，我丧失了党的立场，包庇了反革命，破坏了土地改革，使党和人民受到很大的损失。尤其严重的，是党在耐性地教育我，而我还不能迅速地认识全部的错误，还在替错误辩护。我所以会犯这么一连串严重错误，是因为我在思想上没有入党，还有浓厚的地主阶级和小资产阶级意识。
    我出身于地主家庭，受了长期的封建主义和资本主义教育。虽然十几岁时就接触到革命，但没有好好学习，没有真正理解革命的道理；对劳动阶级只有表面的同情，没有深切的爱；对剥削阶级只有表面的憎恶，没有切齿的仇恨。一九四八年入党之后，仍旧没有彻底检查自己的思想，把那些反动和错误的成分完全肃清。因此，当革命利益和自己的利益冲突时，我就始而立场动摇，观点模糊；继而丧失党的立场；终于产生了包庇反革命的行为。
    解放之前，当我知道俞鼎传加入国民党做了伪县参议员和伪县参议长时，我只认为他这样地堕落下去，完全葬送了他个人的前途；却没有分析他的堕落的根源，没有认识他对革命的危害性。我还把他当做一个“走上歧途的伙伴”，却没有认识到他已是人民的仇敌。
    解放后，我仍极端错误地认为他是一个“罪恶不大”的反革命，以为他还可以改造自新。我一味替他个人的前途设想，完全忘掉革命的利益；我一再要他到北京来学习，工作，却忘记了他是一个反动党团分子，他的罪恶应该受到当地人民的清算。因为我在思想上成了地主反革命的俘虏，于是他对当地干部的谩骂并没有引起我的愤恨。我没有把它们当做反革命言论，却认为是确有其事的“偏差”。
    因为我站的是俞鼎传的立场，不是党和人民的立场，所以当我知道他被捕时，就先在思想上对他包庇起来，错误地认为他的罪恶还够不上逮捕。我不但没有从阶级本质去认识他的反动性，反而毫无阶级观念地以为他的“性格”和“为人”还不坏。我不但不相信当地党和政府的措施，反而相信他自己的“不会作恶”的谎言。我不但不认为他的成为“绅士”是地主和国民党勾结的结果，反而以为由于他对当地“人民”有些好处的原故。我不但没有分析他在解放后的思想，认清他的反动本质并没有改变，反而以为他已在诚心改造自新。他不肯离开家乡，基本上是舍不得放弃家产，我却替他开脱，认为他是“心中无愧”，不愿被人当做逃亡地主。由于这些极端错误的认识，我便怀疑当地干部有“偏差”，恐怕他的被捕未免“冤枉”了。
    我既然有了这些包庇的思想，同时又极其自高自大，自以为是，目无组织和纪律，于是没有向支部报告和请示，也没有和任何人商量，便写信给村政府，申述我的意见。当时自以为站稳了党的立场，把我的意见提供村政府“参考”，其实我根本就站在反革命的立场上，希望达到开释反革命的目的。因而凡是对反革命有利的地方，我就夸张地叙述，凡是对反革命不利的地方，我就轻轻地放过去了。我在信上又暴露了职务和党员身份，表示自己比村政府负责同志高明，给他们一种威胁，使他们重视我的意见，也就是把反革命从宽处置。如果当时我真地站在党的立场上，我就应该对这个伪县参议长的被捕感觉愉快，希望村政府认真为人民除害。
    过了几天我见到俞昌华的信，说土地改革工作队在“乱抓乱打”，并为俞鼎传的被捕抱不平，要我“救救我乡广大的群众”。我在思想上早已和地主反革命站在一起，这些话正和我的思想一致，于是我认为土地改革工作队真有过“左”的“偏差”了。我不但不认为俞昌华是地主反革命的狗腿，反而以为他是一个优秀的干部。因此我就颠倒了是非，把土地改革工作队看成“左倾冒险主义者”，把敌人的狗腿当做“革命干部”，于是俞昌华对土地改革工作队的辱骂并没有刺激我的情感，我更没有从这辱骂中推测他的居心。所以会发生这样严重的错误，正因为狗腿的反映符合俞鼎传的利益，土地改革工作队的措施却和他的利益相抵触。我向党组织反映情况，一面是希望纠正所谓普遍的“偏差”，一面也是希望在所谓“纠偏”中可以求得俞鼎传的开释，达到包庇他的目的。在向党组织的报告中，我没有提到逮捕俞鼎传的事，表面上是避免包庇他，实际上正是要包庇他，因为如果提到自己的哥哥，党组织就会怀疑，也许不会去调查，不会去“纠偏”了。我这样不全面的反映就是对党不老实，欺骗了党。
    我给县长写信，除掉重复了我给村政府写信时的各种严重错误外，更替俞鼎传辩护拆卖房屋的事。我对这事没有调查过，只凭俞鼎传所告诉我的来替他开脱。这也是我丧失立场，不相信干部而相信反革命分子的另一表现。
    四月下旬，我知道俞鼎传被枪决了，虽然认为“调查许久，大概没有冤枉了”，却也没有因为消灭了一个首恶而感觉高兴。如果我已抛弃了地主反革命的立场而站到党的立场上来，我就应该为了一个反革命首恶的枪决而欢欣。
    当我知道了他的被枪决，我已初步地发觉自己犯了错误。当时我想：对他的情况太不了解，为什么那么冒失地写信到南陵去呢？那样天真地以为他对我十分诚实，但他连“戡乱委员会主任”的事都瞒着我，我却仍旧在情感上包庇他，没有分析他的反动本质，因而只觉得他“可恨”，只后悔不该过分相信他而过问了他的事情，却没有把他当做人民的敌人来仇恨。我对自己的错误虽然稍稍有些认识，但并没有认识到它的严重性。我不认识这是丧失了立场的根本错误，只以为是普通的“不了解情况乱发言”，因为我还没有站到党的立场上来认识这个错误。又由于我极其自高自大，怕丢脸，于是我就没有把自己的错误报告组织，只想偷偷地改正这个“冒失”的态度，以后多多警惕。这又是对党不老实的态度。当王志诚同志得到刘仁同志的指示，要我把向党组织反映所谓情况的底稿交去时，我仍旧没有觉悟，没有把写信给南陵方面的事说出来，这更是有意对党隐瞒自己的错误。
    到了七月间，当宋硕同志问我时，我才把写信到南陵去和俞鼎传已经枪决的事完全说出来。等我看了关于他的材料，我一面恨他血债累累，作恶多端，
    一面还在思想上包庇他，怀疑解放前南陵的各种反革命罪恶是否可以全部归罪于他。当时我对他已有仇恨，认为确实应该枪决，但又觉得放开县长，要他一人负全部罪恶责任，对他有欠“公平”。对于拆卖房屋等等，我还是相信他自己以前所说的话，不相信组织上的材料。我所以会这么顽固，还是由于我没有离开地主反革命的立场，认识他的反革命本质；还是由于我不关心人民的利益，却关心反革命的利益。
    党对我是很爱护的。刘仁同志和宋硕同志一再启发我的自觉自悟，但因我基本上是站在地主反革命的立场上，而且没有组织纪律的观念，非常自大，不肯暴露错误，不肯彻底检讨错误，于是便不能及时地认识错误的严重性，及时地真正觉悟。等到王学珍同志等和我谈过两次话，我才初步地认识到错误的严重，但还不知道严重到什么程度。等到开过两次小组会和一次支部会，同志们提出更多的意见，使我得到更大的帮助，我才对自己的错误有了进一步的认识。但对“包庇”的认识还很表面，没有从思想情感深处去挖掘根源。在党员大会上听了王学珍同志的仔细分析，会后再从思想情感深处去分析自己写信的企图，我才认识到自己一开始就在主观上包庇了地主反革命，即使没有写一封信，思想情感上也是彻头彻尾的包庇。我所以这么不易于认清自己的错误，完全因为没有一下子就离开俞鼎传的立场，彻底斩断封建的兄弟情感，站到党的立场上来。只有先站稳党的立场，然后才有正确的武器，才能切实揭露自己的错误。
    由于我的错误，党受到了很大的损失。首先是在南陵人民群众中造成了恶劣的印象，使农民对党和人民政府怀疑。其次是打击了当地干部的威信，使他们在处理问题时缩手缩脚。第三是推延了惩办反革命分子的日期。第四是给各级党委带来了许多麻烦。第五是影响了市教育工作者工会的工作。我觉得异常痛心，不知道怎样才能补偿这么大的损失！
    总起来说，我犯了这么严重的错误，一是因为我有浓厚的地主阶级意识，浓厚的封建情感；一是因为我有浓厚的小资产阶级习气，自高自大，无组织无纪律，甚至以自由主义的态度来对待自己的错误。我没有让个人的利益来服从党和人民的利益，却要使党和人民的利益来服从个人的利益。
    这些反动和错误的意识，大大阻碍了我的进步，使我不能成为一个共产党员。平时虽也觉察到自己的毛病，但总没有严肃地对待它们，没有深刻地检讨。因此，到了一个重要关头，这些毛病就发展为最大最严重的错误。党给我严厉的处分，不仅纯洁了党，也给了我一次最深刻的教育。我决心从头虚心学习，时时警惕，时时反省，真正站稳党的立场，努力工作，来补偿我给党和人民所造成的损失。
