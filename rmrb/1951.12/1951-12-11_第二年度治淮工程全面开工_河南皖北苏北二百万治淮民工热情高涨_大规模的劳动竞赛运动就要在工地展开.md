The second year of the Huai River project has fully commenced. In Henan Province, the Northern Anhui Region, and the Northern Jiangsu Region, two million workers have begun work. Among them, over 400,000 workers are distributed in the upper reaches of the Huai River, with some constructing the Baisha Reservoir on the Ying River and the Banqiao Reservoir on the Ru River in the mountainous area west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Others are working on the vast plains of eastern Henan, dredging the river channels of the Hong River, Ru River, Ying River, and other tributaries of the Huai River. Approximately one million workers are distributed in the middle reaches of the Huai River in Fuyang, Suxian, Lu'an, Chuxian, and other areas, dredging the river channels of the Chong River, Tong River, Tuo River, West Fei River, and over a dozen other tributaries of the Huai River, and constructing flood storage projects such as the Wabuhu Lake and the Menghe Depression. More than 500,000 workers are distributed along a line of over 300 li in the Northern Jiangsu Region from the eastern shore of Hongze Lake to the coast of the Yellow Sea, starting to dig the Northern Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal. In total, there are over twenty construction sites that have begun work in the upper, middle, and lower reaches.

	On these newly opened construction sites, the red flags of the labor teams flutter everywhere. Tens of thousands of spirited workers, chanting work songs, are busily carrying earth and mud, and their enthusiastic labor calls can be heard from miles away. These farmers, who have reaped a good harvest, have even greater enthusiasm for harnessing the Huai River. They say: "Let's work hard, and after we fix the Huai River, even better days are ahead!" At the Banqiao Reservoir construction site in Henan, the Wang Tingxiu labor team of Biyang County established a patriotic pact as soon as they arrived on the dam, formed a technical research group, and created a "dovetail joint" method of digging and transporting soil, which doubled labor efficiency. The Huai River labor models from the first year's project have now become shining banners among the workers.

	Countless medical workers and cultural workers participating in the Huai River project have also rushed to the construction sites. The Henan and Northern Anhui epidemic prevention teams are now assisting the workers in carrying out environmental sanitation work at various construction sites. The work team from the Beijing Film Studio has gone to various places to film vivid scenes. The film projection team of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has rushed to various construction sites in Henan to show movies. The Henan Xinhua Bookstore has established cultural service stations at the Baisha Reservoir construction site and the Banqiao Reservoir construction site. Over eighty members of the Shanghai literary and art circles' work team participating in the Huai River project have recently arrived in Bengbu and are about to go to various construction sites to work. Now, along the thousand-mile Huai River line, two million Huai River workers and various staff members participating in the Huai River project are actively brewing to launch a patriotic labor emulation campaign, and a large-scale Huai River labor emulation campaign will soon vigorously unfold on the Huai River construction sites.

    第二年度治淮工程全面开工
    河南皖北苏北二百万治淮民工热情高涨
    大规模的劳动竞赛运动就要在工地展开
    第二年度治淮工程已全面开工。河南省、皖北区和苏北区已有二百万民工上工。其中四十多万民工分布在淮河上游地区，一部分在京汉铁路以西的山地兴修颍河的白沙水库和汝河的板桥等水库，一部分在豫东大平原上整理洪河、汝河、颍河等淮河支流的河道。约一百万民工分布在淮河中游的阜阳、宿县、六安、滁县等地，整理漴河、潼河、沱河、西淝河等十几条淮河支流的河道，兴建瓦埠湖和濛河洼地等蓄洪工程。五十多万民工分布在苏北区从洪泽湖东岸到黄海海岸的三百多华里的一条线上，动工开挖苏北灌溉总渠。总计上、中、下游已动工的工程共有二十多处。
    在这些新开工的工地上，到处飘扬着民工队的红旗。成千成万的精神饱满的民工，喊着“号子”紧张地抬土挑泥，几里以外，就可以听到他们热情的劳动呼声。这些获得了丰收的农民，治淮的劳动热情更高了。他们说：“下劲干吧，修好淮河，更美好的日子还在后头呢！”在河南板桥水库工地上，泌阳县王廷秀民工分队一上堤就订立了爱国公约，成立了技术研究小组，创造了一种“犬牙交错”的挖土、运土方法，把劳动效率提高了一倍。第一年度工程中的治淮劳动模范，现在成了民工中的光辉的旗帜。
    参加治淮的无数医务工作者和文化工作者也已赶到工地。河南、皖北防疫队现在正在各个工地上帮助民工们作好环境卫生工作。北京电影制片厂的工作队已分赴各处拍摄生动的场面。中华全国总工会的电影放映队已赶到河南各工地放映电影。河南省新华书店在白沙水库工地和板桥两水库工地都已建立了文化服务站。上海市文艺界组织的参加治淮工作队八十余人，最近已到蚌埠，即将赴各工地工作。现在，千里淮河线上，二百万治淮民工和各种参加治淮的工作人员，正在积极地酝酿着开展爱国主义的劳动竞赛，一个大规模的治淮劳动竞赛运动，即将在淮河工地上蓬勃展开。（新华社）
