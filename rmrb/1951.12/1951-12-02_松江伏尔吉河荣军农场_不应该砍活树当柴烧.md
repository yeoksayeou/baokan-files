    Songjiang Volgari River Veterans Farm
    Should Not Cut Down Live Trees for Firewood
    Comrade Editor: We recently went to Shanhe Village, Hegang City, to inspect the work of forest fire prevention. The farmers there reflected that this work can be done well as long as everyone works hard. However, people from the Veterans Farm (referring to the Songjiang Province Volgari River Veterans Farm) often go up the mountain to cut down live trees for firewood. On November 13th, when we went up the mountain to inspect, we saw two people using a large saw to cut down live trees. They were cutting down oak trees that were fifteen to twenty years old. Next to them were several people driving four large rubber-wheeled carts, loading the cut trees. They were the cooks Tian Juxian, work team members Gu Bin, Qu Qingfu, and other comrades from the Veterans Farm. According to our understanding, since the farm was established last year, they have been cutting down live trees for firewood for over a year, having felled no less than several thousand trees. The Government Administration Council and the Northeast People's Government have both issued explicit regulations prohibiting all government agencies and organizations from independently felling trees without approval. The farm's cutting down of live trees for firewood has never been submitted to the forestry authorities for approval. This is a serious act of damaging national resources and wasting timber. We hope that the leading organs of the farm will conduct a thorough inspection and deal with this matter.

    松江伏尔吉河荣军农场
    不应该砍活树当柴烧
    编辑同志：我们最近到鹤岗市山河村去检查护林防火工作。那里的农民反映：只要大家努力，这个工作是可以作好的。但是，荣军农场（指松江省伏尔吉河荣军农场）的人，常常上山砍活树当柴烧。十一月十三日，我们上山去察看，就看见两个人用大锯在拉活树，拉的都是十五年到二十年生的柞树，旁边还有几个人，赶着四辆四套胶皮轮大车，正在装运砍下来的树。他们是荣军农场的炊事员田聚贤、作业队员顾宾、曲庆福等同志。据我们了解，该场从去年建立到现在，一年多来，都是砍活树当柴烧，砍伐已不下数千棵。政务院和东北人民政府都曾有明文规定，不准各机关团体未经批准即自行采伐树木，该场砍活树当柴烧是从未呈请林政机关批核的。这是严重地损害国家资源和浪费木材的行为。我们希望该场领导机关深入检查并作处理。
