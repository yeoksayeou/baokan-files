Scientific and Technological Workers Must Correct Various Erroneous Views

To the Editor:

For more than two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the ideological level of our New China's scientific and technological workers has significantly improved. However, it is undeniable that because we lived in the old society for a long time, we still have many very serious shortcomings to this day. For example, the purely technical viewpoint and disregard for political inclinations are quite strong among our scientific and technological workers. In a study group of a certain organization, few scientific and technological workers speak during political studies; but when it comes to technical issues, they put aside political studies and launch into lively discussions. The worship of the United States has not been completely eliminated among our scientific and technological workers. For example, some technical workers write notes in English and mix English into their speech, as if using the language of our motherland would insult them!

The high tide of various constructions in New China is about to arrive. In order to meet the needs of our motherland's construction work, our scientific and technological workers must earnestly carry out self-education and self-transformation. We also hope that relevant authorities will strengthen their leadership over us. I believe that through this ideological remolding movement, our scientific and technological workers will surely make greater progress and exert greater power in the various construction tasks of the motherland.

New Engineering and Technical Personnel Should Participate in the Ideological Remolding Movement

To the Editor:

The ideological remolding movement has now been launched throughout the country. Some engineering and technical personnel have not actively participated in this movement. In fact, they very much need to remold their ideology, especially some people with serious ideological problems. As far as I know, an engineer named Su Cheng worked in a certain organization last spring. Before long, without organizational permission, he privately ran off to work for the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Production Department of the North China Military Region. This spring, he again privately ran off to work for the Supply Department of the General Office of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, and now he has left the Supply Department again. In less than two years, he has jumped to four jobs in a row. Such technical personnel who only seek good treatment and are not committed to their work should be criticized. This is by no means an isolated example in the entire engineering and technical field. In order to prevent such people from creating chaos, I suggest: (1) All enterprises, organizations, and groups should resolutely implement the State Council's decision to investigate the background of personnel when employing them, and never recklessly recruit people; (2) Strengthen the ideological remolding work in the engineering and technical field.

Natural Scientists Cannot Escape the Domination of Philosophy

To the Editor:

The bourgeois education I received made it impossible for me to understand the correct relationship between natural science and philosophy for a long time. Although I acknowledge the guiding role of philosophy in revolutionary practice, I always thought it was irrelevant to natural science. When someone pointed out my error, I even used Newton's motto of "hypotheses non fingo" to argue with him.

Precisely because I had this deep-rooted prejudice, I often fell into errors when dealing with scientific problems. In fact, although I tried to deny the dominance of philosophy over natural science, I became the slave of the worst kind of philosophy.

For example, when studying our country's natural resources, I always thought that our country, in addition to having very abundant coal reserves, had very "limited" other mineral deposits. Therefore, I came to the erroneous conclusion that China is large but not "rich in resources." It was not until now, when I saw that the Central People's Government had discovered several rare metal deposits in the Northeast, a phosphate mine in a certain place in East China, and lead sand in a certain place shortly after its establishment, that I realized my past views were completely incorrect.

Why did I make such a mistake in the past? The main reason is that my observation of problems started from a static perspective. Needless to say, this static way of observing problems belongs to the metaphysical system and is completely different from the theorem of materialist dialectics regarding observing phenomena "from the point of view of their movement, their change, their development, their generation and decay" (Stalin: "Dialectical and Historical Materialism"). As Engels said: "Natural scientists believe that they can only free themselves from philosophy by ignoring or insulting it. However, they cannot take a step forward without thinking, and to think, they must have thinking definitions. However, these categories are unconsciously taken from the general consciousness of those so-called educated people who are ruled by the remnants of philosophy that have long been outdated, or from the bit of philosophy heard in compulsory university courses... or from various philosophical works read uncritically and chaotically... No matter what attitude natural scientists are pleased to take, they are always under the domination of philosophy. The question is only whether they are willing to be dominated by a bad, fashionable philosophy, or by a theoretical form of thinking based on knowledge of the history of thinking and its achievements." ("Dialectics of Nature," People's Publishing House, pp. 42-43)

Therefore, the problem is very clear. In order to avoid making mistakes in science and to achieve greater development in science, we must get rid of our inherent erroneous philosophical influences and earnestly study Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly transform our own ideology.

Study Documents Well and Conduct Self-Education and Self-Transformation

To the Editor:

Documents are the most useful weapons to help us with self-education and self-transformation; we must read documents frequently in order to master the weapons and solve our own ideological problems in a targeted manner.

Recently, I read Stalin's "Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) at the Eighteenth Party Congress." In this document, Stalin pointed out: "Those who are limited to their own specialized knowledge, for example, to mathematics, botany, or chemistry, and who cannot see anything other than their own specialized knowledge, even if they call themselves Leninists, cannot be regarded as true Leninists. A Leninist must not only be an expert in the science he loves, but also a politician and social activist, actively concerned about the fate of the country, familiar with the laws of social development, good at applying these laws, and striving to become an active participant in the political leadership of the country." ("Problems of Leninism," Moscow Chinese Edition, p. 783) I think Stalin's words reveal my true colors. First of all, I am someone who cannot see anything other than my own specialized knowledge. Because I used to only want to acquire specialized knowledge and become an expert in order to climb up for personal selfish interests. Although I also know that what I call "specialized knowledge" is not yet "special," I am always moving in the direction of "special." Secondly, I am someone who does not care about politics, does not participate in social activities, and does not care about the fate of the country. Because I used to like to shut myself in my study, burying myself in old papers, and seeking some decadent "specialized knowledge" that was not in line with the needs of the country and the interests of the people according to my own interests. That is how I wasted more than ten years of precious time that can never be recovered. I feel that "scholarship for scholarship's sake" is noble, and that caring about politics and social activities is not my business. My so-called business is only to pursue "specialized knowledge." Regarding the reactionary rule of the past, I had more complaints than hatred, and I did not have the determination to fundamentally eliminate it; sometimes I even pinned my hopes on the reactionary rulers, hoping that one day they could wake up and reform. Regarding the earth-shattering revolutionary struggles, I was more afraid than sympathetic, and I avoided them more than I participated in them. Regarding the fate of the country, I was not actively concerned, but passively pessimistic.

In front of the bright mirror of the document, I found that my face was so filthy and terrible, that I was such a self-proclaimed "apolitical," "noble" person, but in reality a selfish and self-interested character! Now, I deeply realize that I should honestly transform myself in this study, truly stand firmly on the people's position, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, closely integrate my work with the current political struggle, and strive to be a true expert of the people, a social activist, under the great banner of patriotism.

    努力改造思想，为祖国建设服务
    科学技术工作者要纠正各种错误观点
    编辑同志：两年多来，我们新中国的科学技术工作者，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，思想水平已显著提高。但不可否认，由于我们长期地生活在旧社会里，直到今天，我们仍然有很多很严重的缺点。比方说，单纯技术观点和不问政治倾向，在我们科学技术工作者间，就是颇为浓厚的。某机关有
    一个学习小组，其中有一部分科学技术工作者，在进行政治学习时，就很少有人发言；但一谈到技术问题，就撇开政治学习，津津有味地扯开了。崇美思想在我们科学技术工作者间，也还没有彻底肃清。例如，有的技术工作者写笔记时用英文，说话时也夹杂英文，好像使用了我们祖国的语言，倒会污辱了自己似的！
    新中国的各种建设的高潮将要到来。为了适合我们祖国建设工作的需要，我们科学技术工作者必须认真进行自我教育和自我改造。并希望有关机关加强对我们的领导。我相信经过这次思想改造运动，我们科学技术工作者必将会获得更大的进步，在祖国各项建设工作中发挥更大的力量。

    工程技术人员应参加思想改造运动
    编辑同志：思想改造运动，现已在全国各地开展起来了。有些工程技术人员，还没有积极参加这个运动。其实，他们很需要改造思想，尤其是某些有严重思想问题的人。据我所知，有一位叫苏诚的工程师，去年春季在某机关任职。没有多久，他不经组织许可，便私自跑进了华北军区生产部供销总社工作。今年春季，他又私自跑进中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会办公厅供给处工作，现在他又脱离供给处了。不满两年，他接连跳了四个工作岗位。这种只讲求待遇不安心工作的技术人员，是应该受到批判的。在整个工程技术界中，这绝不是个别的例子。为了杜绝这种人胡闹的空隙，我建议：（一）各企业、各机关和各团体，应坚决执行政务院关于使用人员一定要追查来历的决定，决不乱拉乱用；
    （二）加强工程技术界的思想改造工作。

    自然科学家不能摆脱哲学的支配
    编辑同志：我所受的资产阶级的教育，使我长期不能认识自然科学和哲学的正确关系。我虽然承认哲学对于革命实践的指导作用，但总认为它是和自然科学无关的。当有人向我指出我的这一错误时，我还拿出牛顿的“勿托空言”的格言，和他抗辩。
    正由于我有这种根深蒂固的偏见，所以在处理科学问题时，就时常陷于错误之中。事实上，我虽力图否定哲学对自然科学的支配，但却做了最坏的哲学的奴隶。
    举一个例子来说：我在研究我国的自然资源时，总认为我国除了煤的藏量非常丰富外，其他矿藏非常“有限”。因此，我就得出了一个错误的结论：中国地大而物“不博”。直到现在，我看到中央人民政府成立不久，就在东北发现了好几种稀有金属的矿藏，在华东某地发现了磷矿，在某地发现了铅砂，才认识到自己过去的看法是完全不正确的。
    为什么过去我会犯了这样的错误呢？主要就在于我的观察问题是从静态出发的。不消说，这一种静态地观察问题的方法，是属于形而上学的体系，是和唯物辩证法关于观察现象“要从它们的运动，它们的变化，它们的发展，它们的产生和衰亡方面去观察”（斯大林：“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）的定理截然不同的。这正如恩格斯所说：“自然科学家相信：他们只有忽视哲学或凌辱哲学才能从哲学下面摆脱出来。但是，他们离开了思惟便不能前进一步，而要思惟就必须要有思惟规定。然而这些范畴是不知不觉地从那被早已过时了的哲学底残余所统治着的所谓有教养的人们底一般意识取来的，或是从大学必修课中所听到的一点儿哲学……中取来的，或是从无批判地和杂乱地读到的各种各样的哲学著作中取来的。……不管自然科学家们高兴采取怎样的态度，他们总还是在哲学底支配之下。问题只在于他们究竟愿意一个坏的时髦的哲学来支配他们，还是愿意一个建立在思惟历史及其成绩的知识上的理论思惟形式来支配他们。”（“辩证法与自然科学”、人民出版社版、四二——四三页）
    因此，问题已非常明显，我们为了使自己在科学上不犯错误，使科学获得更高的发展，就必须摆脱自己固有的错误的哲学影响，认真学习马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，彻底地改造自己的思想。

    好好学习文件进行自我教育
    和自我改造
    编辑同志：文件是帮助我们自我教育和自我改造的最有利的武器；必须经常阅读文件，才能掌握武器，并有的放矢地解决自己的思想问题。
    最近，我读了斯大林“在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”。在这一文件中，斯大林指出：“那种局限于自己的专门知识，譬如说局限于数学、植物学或化学，而除了自己的专门知识以外，再也看不见其他什么东西的人，虽然他们自称为列宁主义者，也决不能视为真正列宁主义者的。列宁主义者决不能仅仅是他自己所喜爱的那门科学的专家，他同时还应当是政治家和社会活动家，积极关怀本国命运，通晓社会发展规律，善于运用这些规律，并力求成为积极参加国家政治领导工作的人。”（“列宁主义问题”、莫斯科中文版、七八三页）我认为斯大林的话，就正揭露了我的本来面目。首先我就是一个除了自己的专门知识以外，再也看不见其他什么东西的人。因为我从前只想求得专门知识变成专家，以达到个人自私自利向上爬的目的。虽然我也知道我之所谓“专门知识”还够不上“专”，但是总是向着“专”这一方面走。其次，我就是一个不过问政治，不参加社会活动，不关心本国命运的人。因为我过去总喜欢把自己封闭在书斋里，埋头在故纸堆中，根据自己的兴趣寻求一些腐朽的不合国家需要和人民利益的“专门知识”。就是这样，我浪费了十多年再也抓不回来的宝贵光阴。我觉得“为学术而学术”是清高的，认为过问政治和社会活动不是我的事。所谓我的事，只是追求“专门知识”。对于过去的反动统治，我是牢骚有余，痛恨不足，没有根本铲除它的决心；有时反寄幻想于反动统治者，希望它有一天能觉悟过来，改过自新。对于惊天动地的革命斗争，则是畏惧甚于同情，躲避甚于参加。对于国家命运，不是积极地关怀，而是消极地悲观。
    在文件这面光亮的镜子面前，我发现自己的面目是如此龌龊可怕，自己是这样一个自以为“超政治”的“清高”的，但实际是自私自利的人物！现在，我深切地认识到自己应在这次学习中，老老实实地改造一番，真正站稳人民立场，划清敌我界限，把自己的工作和当前的政治斗争密切结合起来，在伟大的爱国主义的旗帜下，争取做一个真正的人民的专家，一个社会活动家。
