Please accept the brotherly salute of the Hungarian people
——A letter from the Hungarian People's Delegation to the National Day Observance to the Chinese People's Volunteers

Our dear friends and comrades:

We, the five members of the Hungarian delegation, have come to your great country at the invitation of your people, and like the representatives of other fraternal countries, we are celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with the heroic Chinese people. We believe that if we forget you, or do not extend our war-tested, strong hands to you through this letter, then our stay in China and participation in the National Day celebration will not be perfect.

We are the sons and daughters and envoys of the Hungarian working people, and we bring the warm greetings of our people to the Chinese people. Please allow us to convey this brotherly salute to you. We have seen the Chinese workers who are building a bright future for the motherland. We have seen the Chinese farmers who are working diligently on their own land. We have seen the Chinese soldiers who are holding their weapons tightly. We have experienced the beautiful fruits that your country has obtained, and we admire the scenery of your country, but what we like the most is the Chinese people. Your people are strong, and we feel infinite joy, because we realize that the strength of your people is our strength, and we realize that this capable and great people are a member of the strong family of all nations advancing along the great socialist road, and a heroic fighter on the peace front.

It is touching that the Chinese people are giving heroic assistance to our common brothers – the Korean brothers who have suffered aggression, protecting them with their own bodies, and preventing them from being invaded by vicious war instigators and murderers. You know that our most precious treasure – peace – is unified and indivisible. You are fighting in Korea for the peace of your country and all mankind, and also for the peace of our people. Our people also understand this truth and think of you with full gratitude. Brothers, your struggle together with the heroic Korean people is also for us, and we express our gratitude to you here. At the same time, we are not standing idly by. We know that every factory, house, school, and hospital we build, every tractor, locomotive, and lathe we manufacture in our factories, every action we take, and every plan we realize to accelerate socialist construction, all increase the strength of the entire peace camp and also increase your strength.

The imperialist lackeys who are preparing to carry out aggression – the Tito gang – are on the southern border of our country. The greedy eyes of his masters are staring fiercely and maliciously at our achievements in all aspects. We are using the sharp weapons of labor to defeat their despicable plans. If they want to invade our motherland, we will surely be inspired by your example and will also take up weapons to prove to them that free people who defend peace and a happy future are invincible.

Brothers, on behalf of the Hungarian workers, peasants, artists, scholars, women, and children, and on behalf of all Hungarian peace-loving people, we once again salute you with love. We firmly believe that the result of our joint efforts will surely be victory. We wish you good health and further victories.

        General Secretary of the Hungarian Democratic Women's League
                        Istvánné Vas

    请接受匈牙利人民的兄弟般的敬礼
    ——匈牙利人民参加我国国庆节观礼代表团给中国人民志愿军的一封信我们亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    我们匈牙利代表团五位团员，应贵国人民的邀请来到你们伟大的祖国，与其他兄弟国家代表一样，和英勇的中国人民一起庆祝中华人民共和国成立的二周年。我们认为，如果我们把你们忘记了，或者不通过这封信来握一下你们在战争中久经考验的、坚强的手的话，那么我们在中国的逗留和参加国庆节将不是十全十美的。
    我们是匈牙利劳动人民的儿女和使者，我们带来了我国人民对中国人民的热烈敬礼。请允许我们将这个兄弟般的敬礼转达给你们。我们看见了正在建设祖国的美好的将来的中国工人。我们看见了在自己的土地上辛勤劳动的中国农民。我们看见了紧紧拿着武器的中国士兵。我们体验到了贵国所得到的美丽的果实，我们对贵国的风景赞赏不已，但是我们最欢喜的还是中国人民。贵国人民是强大的，我们感到无限的喜悦，因为认识到贵国人民的力量就是我们的力量，认识到这个富有能力的伟大人民是沿着伟大的社会主义道路前进的各民族人民强有力的家庭中的一员，是和平战线上英勇的斗士。
    令人感动的是中国人民所给予我们共同的兄弟——遭受侵略的朝鲜兄弟们的英勇援助，用自己的身躯保护他们，使他们不受凶恶的战争挑拨者和杀人犯的侵略。你们知道，我们最珍贵的宝物——和平——是统一的，是不可分割的。你们在朝鲜作战是为了争取贵国和全人类的和平，也是为了我国人民的和平。我国人民同样懂得这个道理而且怀着充分的谢意挂念着你们。兄弟们，你们和英勇的朝鲜人民在一起所进行的斗争也是为了我们，我们在这里向你们表示谢意。同时我们也不袖手旁观。我们知道，我们所建筑的每一个工场、住宅、学校和医院，我们工场所制造的每一架拖拉机、火车头、车床，我们的每一行动，我们为加速社会主义建设而实现的每一个计划，都增加了整个和平阵营的力量，也增加了你们的力量。
    准备进行侵略的帝国主义走狗——铁托匪帮就在我们国境的南边。他的主子的贪婪的眼睛正在狠狠地、恶意地注视着我们各方面的成就。我们正在用锋利的劳动的武器来战败他们的卑劣计划。假如他们要侵犯我们的祖国，我们定将为你们的榜样所鼓舞，也要手持武器向他们证明：维护和平和幸福的将来的自由人民是不可击败的。
    兄弟们，我们代表匈牙利工人、农民、艺术家、学者、妇女和儿童，代表全体匈牙利爱好和平的人民，再一次地怀着热爱向你们致敬。我们深信，我们共同努力的结果，必然是胜利。祝你们身体健康，祝你们获得进一步的胜利。
