Strive to Promote Pigskin Leather Making and Actively Utilize Abundant Resources
Ai Zhicheng, Director of the Light Industry Department, Central Ministry of Light Industry

    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, promoting pigskin leather making is of great significance for strengthening national defense and economic construction. Due to the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in the past, our country is extremely short of draught cattle. In order to increase agricultural production and ensure military and civilian food supplies, the people's government's measures to protect draught cattle are absolutely necessary. At the same time, in order to strengthen national defense and restore and develop industry, the demand for leather has surged. In order to solve the current difficulty of raw hide shortage in the leather industry, and to save a large amount of cattle hide and rubber raw materials for national defense and economic construction, we must strive to promote pigskin leather making.

    Most people in our country are accustomed to eating pork; pigskin is one of our country's abundant resources. According to the 1931 statistics, the world produced 268,771,100 pigs, of which China accounted for 23.2 percent of the total, ranking first in the world in pig production. According to the 1950 statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture, the country produced 62,260,000 pigs. After the land reform, the rural economic situation has generally improved, and the output will increase greatly. Calculated at an 80 percent slaughter rate, the country can strip about 50 million pigskins annually. Calculating five pigskins equivalent to one cowhide, it is equivalent to an annual increase of about 10 million cowhides, which can completely meet the current needs of the national leather industry. Fifty million pigskins, used to make leather shoes, with each skin averaging 1.5 to 2 pairs of shoes, can produce more than 70 million to 100 million pairs of leather shoes. Each raw pigskin, calculated at the Beijing price, averages about 70,000 RMB. Fifty million pigskins are worth a total of 3.5 trillion RMB. If a portion is exported in exchange for foreign exchange, plus profit, the total value would be even higher. If used to purchase spinning spindles, at 57.6 billion RMB to set up 10,000 spindles, it can build spinning factories with more than 600,000 spindles. That is to say, as long as the people of the whole country do not eat pigskin for five years, they can basically make up for the lack of spindles in our country's textile industry. If we continue not to eat pigskin for a long time, we can save a lot of money every year to be used in various national construction undertakings. What a rich resource this is! Pigskin in food is actually optional, and habitually a large part of it is discarded and wasted. It is intolerable to allow such a valuable national resource to continue to be wasted.

    As early as a hundred years ago, the Jiaodong area of our country had a method of smoking pigskin. After 1911, the Tianjin Leather Factory had already used potassium dichromate tanning method to make blue bottom leather from pigskin, which was sold in North and Northwest China. In 1939, the Northeast produced 349,833 pieces of leather made from pigskin. In 1950, Wendeng area of Shandong province manufactured more than 133,000 pieces of pig leather. All regions of the country have used indigenous smoking methods to manufacture pig leather. Although the total number has not been counted, it is estimated that the quantity is not small. Most countries in the world have long utilized pigskin for leather making. For example, the Soviet Union could produce 9 million pigskins annually before 1935. The use of pigskin for leather making has a long history, and whether in technology or application, there has been a lot of advanced experience.

    In December 1950, the Leather Industry Conference convened by the Central Ministry of Light Industry resolved a draft method for utilizing pigskin for leather making, which was approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and then began various experimental work on pigskin leather making. The results of these experiments were very good. The Central Ministry of Light Industry also sent personnel to advanced areas such as Northeast and Shandong for investigation and research on pigskin leather making, and the results obtained were also good. Based on these materials, the Ministry of Light Industry put forward specific opinions and formulated a method for gradually promoting pigskin leather making, and submitted it to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council to be first tried out in Beijing, in order to learn from experience and train skinning technicians; and to introduce the past experience of pig leather making in the Northeast, Tianjin, and Shanghai.

    Since the Leather Industry Conference in December 1950, over the past year, various regions of the country have begun to experiment and vigorously promote the use of pigskin for leather making. In Northeast and Shandong and other places, many factories that originally manufactured cowhide have, since this year, mostly or entirely converted to making pig leather. Seven major cities in the Northeast, including Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, and Qiqihar, peel an average of 1,500 pigskins per day. There are already factories in Shenyang that can manufacture 1,000 pieces of pig leather per day. Jinan, Qingdao and other cities, which originally did not peel skin when slaughtering pigs or peeled a small amount, are also preparing to start peeling or increase the amount of skinning. Large cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chongqing are also trying to promote pigskin leather making.

    The pilot work in Beijing is led by the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, and the Pig Leather Trial Production Committee composed of relevant units is responsible for the unified promotion. From August 28th to November 10th, 1951, a total of 1,200 pigskins were peeled and delivered to Zhenbei, Tongzengde leather factories and the Yanjing University Affiliated Leather Factory for trial production. Several batches have been made, and the results are very good, and the technology is improving day by day; preparations are now being made for full promotion. From the actual experiment over the past year, we can now determine that compared with cowhide, in terms of bottom leather, although the tensile strength of cowhide is slightly greater than that of pigskin, and the water absorption is slightly smaller than that of pigskin, the wear resistance is far less than that of pigskin (shoes made of pigskin are about 50 percent more durable than cowhide); for other properties, cowhide and pigskin are not much different. Facts have proved that the use of pigskin to manufacture general daily-use leather products can fully meet the needs. At the same time, the disadvantage of pigskin being prone to water penetration can be remedied in tanning technology.

    In the pilot work in Beijing, we encountered many difficulties. The first is the skinning technology, the second is the preservation problem, the third is the hair removal problem, the fourth is the wage problem, the fifth is the price problem, and the sixth is the technical problem during trial production. These problems were quite troublesome at the beginning, but with the close cooperation of the relevant agencies, they were finally completely overcome!

    When the trial skinning of pigskin began in Beijing, because of the lack of skilled workers, there were many skin injuries, and even up to 40 knife wounds on one skin. After training and guidance, this situation quickly improved. The main method of instruction is to take skilled workers as the core and conduct training in a planned manner. After the workers are well trained, they can peel a pigskin in about five minutes per person. The problem of preservation, after experiments, dry salting method is more convenient and effective. Hair removal by coating method is simple and can preserve pig bristles, which is also very good. In terms of wages, at the beginning of skinning, because of poor technology, slow movements, and many knife wounds, both the pig owner and the technicians had problems in their thinking; after patient persuasion, they gradually turned around. Price is a more troublesome problem. If the price of the skin is higher than the price of the meat, there will be waste of meat and oil attached to the skin; if the price of the meat is higher than the price of the skin, the pig owner, considering his own interests, will not want to peel the skin. Therefore, the price of skin and meat should be equal. Regarding the leather making technology, according to the results of the research and experiments by the Leather Research Group of the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute, the effect of promotion in Beijing is still good. (The article "Experimental Report on Pigskin Leather Making" in the fifth issue of the second volume of "China Light Industry" can be used as a reference.) When the Central Ministry of Light Industry began to promote the tanning method of the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute in Beijing, individual factories were accustomed to the old ways and resisted the idea. After much persuasion and several actual experiments, the method was accepted by everyone. These experiences are also worth noting for comrades in various places who are promoting the work.

    When pig leather is first promoted in various places, the difficulty of selling skinned pork will inevitably be encountered. In the past, the general public was accustomed to buying pork with skin. They had more or less concerns about pork without skin. They were worried that meat without skin would not be easy to tell the quality of, and they were afraid of buying sick or dead pork. In fact, these concerns are not difficult to break. As long as we strengthen market management, pay special attention to hygiene inspection, packaging and transportation, and the cleanliness of slaughterhouses, and at the same time pay attention to publicity work, first ask government agencies, schools, troops, and factories to take the lead in refusing to buy pork with skin, and use movies, slides, broadcasting, cartoons, and other means to publicize, we can gradually break all ideological concerns of citizens. The most important thing is that in each region, after the preparatory work is done, it is best to promote it comprehensively, not just partially. Under comprehensive promotion, meat with skin disappears, and citizens will buy meat without skin. Habits are not impossible to change.

    The China Animal Products Company of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has begun preparations for the acquisition of pigskins in 56 cities across the country. Based on the different conditions in various regions, the China Animal Products Company is preparing to immediately start the work of acquiring pigskins in the Northeast and Shandong and other places where there is already a habit of slaughtering pigs and peeling skins. In other regions of the country, preparations are being made to fully launch this work next year.

    In order to solve the specific problems in the work of peeling and acquiring pigskins, the China Animal Products Company convened the first National Pigskin Technology Research Conference in November. The conference has drafted management and technical plans for peeling, acquiring, and preserving pigskins.

    Technological progress is endless. The raw materials used are different, and the climate varies, and there are considerable differences. We want to especially point out that the report of the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute is only a summary of experimental work; if we can work hard to study, we can certainly research better and more advanced tanning methods. In order to improve the level of our country's leather industry, we earnestly hope that comrades engaged in the leather industry across the country will work together to create more and better experiences and new records. At the same time, we also hope that leaders at all levels and people across the country will vigorously support the promotion of using pigskin for leather making, using this vast and unlimited resource, and taking this as part of the great movement to increase production and practice economy.

    努力推行猪皮制革　积极利用丰富资源
    中央轻工业部轻工业处处长　艾志诚
    在增产节约运动中，推广猪皮制革，对于加强国防建设和经济建设都有极大的意义。由于过去国民党反动统治的摧残，我国耕牛极感缺乏。为了增加农业生产，保证军需民食，人民政府采取保护耕牛的措施是完全必要的。同时，为了加强国防建设和恢复发展工业，皮革的需要量随之激增。为了解决目前制革工业上原料皮缺乏的困难，并且为了节约出大量牛皮和橡胶原料用到国防建设和经济建设上去，就必须努力推行猪皮制革。
    我国大多数人民是习惯于吃猪肉的；猪皮是我国的丰富资源之一。据一九三一年的统计，全世界产猪二亿六千八百七十七万一千只，其中我国所产就占总数的百分之二十三点二，居世界各国产猪量的首位。据一九五○年农业部的统计，全国产猪六千二百二十六万只。土地改革后，农村经济情况普遍改善，产量还要大大增加。以百分之八十的屠宰率计算，每年全国就能剥猪皮约五千万张。用五张猪皮抵一张牛皮计算，就等于每年增多约一千万张，已可完全满足目前全国制革工业的需要。五千万张猪皮革，用来做皮鞋，以每张皮平均制鞋一双半至两双计，可制成皮鞋七千多万双到一亿双。每张生猪皮照北京市价计，平均约值人民币七万元。五千万张猪皮，就合人民币三万五千亿元。如果出口一部换回外汇，加上利润，总值比这还要多。如果拿来购置纺纱锭子，照五百七十六亿元设置一万锭计，可以建设六十万锭以上的纺纱工厂。这就是说，只要全国人民五年不吃猪皮，就可以基本上把我国纺织工业所不够的纺锭补足了。倘若长期继续不吃猪皮，每年就可以节约很多的钱来用在国家的各种建设事业上。这是多么丰富的资源！猪皮在食物中，实际上是可吃可不吃的，而且习惯上也有大部分是抛弃的，浪费的。这样有价值的国家资源，如果让他再浪费下去，实在是不能容忍的事。
    远在一百年前，我国胶东地区就有烟薰猪皮的方法。一九一一年后，天津市制革厂就已经把猪皮用重铬酸钾鞣制法蓝底革，行销华北西北一带。一九三九年，东北曾产猪皮制成的革三十四万九千八百三十三张。一九五○年山东文登地区就制造了十三万三千多张猪革。全国各地区都有用烟薰土法制造猪革的。总数虽然没有统计，估计数量也不少。世界各国大多早已利用猪皮制革。例如苏联于一九三五年前，每年就可以生产猪皮九百万张。利用猪皮制革已具悠久历史，无论在技术上或应用上，都已有了不少先进的经验。
    一九五○年十二月间，中央轻工业部召开的制革工业会议，曾议决了一个利用猪皮制革的办法草案，经政务院财政经济委员会核准后，就开始进行猪皮制革的种种试验工作，这些试验的结果都很好。中央轻工业部又派员到东北、山东等猪皮制革先进地区进行调查研究，得到的结果也好。轻工业部根据这些材料，提出具体意见，拟订逐步推行猪皮制革办法，呈请政务院财政经济委员会先由北京市试行，借以吸取经验，训练剥皮技工；并且把东北、天津、上海过去制猪革的经验介绍出来。
    一九五○年十二月制革工业会议后，一年来，全国各地区已经开始试验和大力推广用猪皮制革。东北和山东等地，许多原来制造牛革的工厂，从今年起都已大部或全部改制猪革。东北的沈阳、长春、吉林、哈尔滨、牡丹江、佳木斯、齐齐哈尔等七大城市，每天平均剥取猪皮一千五百张，沈阳当地已有每天能制造一千张猪革的工厂。原来杀猪不剥皮或剥皮数量较少的济南、青岛等城市，也准备开始剥皮或增加剥皮数量。上海、北京、天津、广州、重庆等大城市也都在试行推广猪皮制革。
    北京市的试制工作由市财政经济委员会领导，并由各有关单位组成的猪革试制委员会统一主持推行。由一九五一年八月二十八日起至十一月十日止，先后共剥取了猪皮一千二百张，分交振北、同增德两制革厂和燕京大学附设制革厂试制，现在已经制成几批，结果很好，而且技术也日益进步；现在正准备全面推行。由一年来的实际试验中，我们已可确定：猪革与牛革相比，以底革言，牛革的抗张力虽比猪革稍大，吸水量虽比猪革稍小，但耐磨力则远不如猪革之大（用猪革制成鞋底，耐穿程度超过牛革百分之五十左右）；其余的性能，牛革猪革并没什么差别。事实证明，用猪革制造一般日用皮革制品，完全可以满足需要。同时，猪革容易透水的缺点是可以在鞣制技术上加以补救的。
    在北京市的试制工作中，我们所遭遇到的困难很多。第一是剥皮技术问题，第二是保存问题，第三是脱毛问题，第四是工资问题，第五是价格问题，第六是试制时的技术问题。这些问题开始都是相当麻烦的，但是，在各有关机关的密切配合下，终于完全克服了！
    当在北京开始试剥猪皮时，因为缺乏熟练工人，皮伤甚多，一张皮的刀伤甚至多到四十多处。经过训练教导，这种情况很快就改善了。教导的方法主要是以熟练工人为核心，有计划地进行训练。工人训练好以后，大概每人每五分钟就可以剥下猪皮一张。保存的问题，经实验用盐干法比较方便有效。用涂里法脱毛，既简单又可保存猪鬃，也是很好的。在工资方面，最初剥皮时因为技术不好，动作慢、刀伤多，猪主和技工双方在思想上都有问题；经过耐心说服，慢慢地都扭转过来了。价格是一个比较麻烦的问题，如果皮价高过肉价，就会有皮上随带肉油的浪费现象；如果肉价高过皮价，猪主考虑到自己的利益，就不愿剥皮。因此，皮和肉的价格以相等为好。关于制革技术问题，照上海工业试验所皮革研究组研究试验的结果，在北京推广，效果还好。（“中国轻工业”第二卷第五期上的“猪皮制革试验报告”一文，可供参考。）当中央轻工业部在北京开始推行上海工业试验所的鞣制方法时，个别工厂狃于习惯，思想上有抗拒。经多方说服及好几次的实际试验后，这方法才被大家接受。这些经验也值得各地推行工作的同志们加以注意。
    在各地开始推行猪革时，剥皮猪肉不易销售，是必然会碰到的困难。过去一般市民，习惯于买带皮的猪肉，他们对于不带皮的猪肉，或多或少有些顾虑。他们耽心没有皮的肉不容易看出好坏，恐怕买着病猪肉、死猪肉。其实，这些顾虑是不难打破的。只要加强市场管理，特别注意卫生检验、包扎运输和屠宰场的清洁工作，同时注意进行宣传工作，先请政府机关、学校、部队、工厂起带头作用，自动拒买带皮猪肉，并利用电影、幻灯、广播、漫画，加以宣传，就可以逐渐打破市民的一切思想顾虑。最重要的是，在每一地区，准备工作做好后，最好全面推行，不要只是部分推行。在全面推行下，带皮肉绝迹了，市民就要买没皮的肉了。习惯并不是没法改变的。
    中央人民政府贸易部中国畜产公司已在全国五十六个城市中，进行收购猪皮的准备工作。根据各地不同情况，中国畜产公司准备在已有杀猪剥皮习惯的东北和山东等地，立即着手进行收购猪皮的工作。在全国其他地区，都准备明年全面展开这个工作。
    为了解决剥取猪皮和收购猪皮工作中的具体问题，中国畜产公司已在十一月间召开了第一次全国猪皮技术研究会议。会议已拟定了关于剥取、收购、保存猪皮的管理方案和技术方案。
    技术的进步是无止境的。所用的原料不同，气候各异，也有相当差别。我们要特别指出：上海工业试验所的报告仅只是一个实验工作的总结；如果我们能努力钻研，一定还可以研究出更好、更进步的鞣制办法。为了要把我国制革工业水准提高一步，我们热切希望全国从事制革工业的同志们，共同努力，创造出更多更好的经验和新纪录。同时我们也希望全国各地各级领导干部和全国人民，努力支持推行利用猪皮制革，利用这个广大无限的资源，把这作为伟大的增产节约运动的一部分。
