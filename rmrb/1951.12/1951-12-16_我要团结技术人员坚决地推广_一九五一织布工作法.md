    I Want to Unite with Technicians to Resolutely Promote the "1951 Weaving Method"
    Tianjin Model Laborer First Class Jiang Shuying
    The National Weaving Method Conference had a great impact on me. Usually, I only knew how to work and didn’t know what a work method was. Later, Technician He from our factory used his theory to help me study and summarize my work method. In the summary, he told me which points were good methods and which were not. This National Weaving Method Conference brought together the advanced experiences of national model laborers and the theories of technical personnel. During the conference, everyone was asked to perform on the machines so that everyone could see what was good and what was not, and then bring it up for everyone to study and discuss. After more than twenty days of work, the "1951 Weaving Method" was successfully summarized.
    After this conference, I understood even more that if workers only work and technical personnel do not use theory to help us, our technical level cannot be improved; similarly, if technical personnel only write a set of methods and tell the workers to do it, it is also impractical and will not work. Workers and technical personnel must unite, and everyone must discuss and study together.
    In the past, when we made patriotic pacts in the factory, we always wanted to increase production and donate more to support our volunteers. Later, we were eager to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, but we never had a good method. Now it is possible. We have learned the "1951 Weaving Method," which can save and increase production, not only allowing us to watch more machines but also without getting tired. In the future, I guarantee to resolutely promote the "1951 Weaving Method" so that all weavers in Tianjin can learn the new work method. When everyone learns it, they can increase production and practice economy, accumulate more wealth for the country, and support our most beloved people – the Chinese People's Volunteers. I will respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy by overcoming difficulties in promoting the "1951 Weaving Method."
    I know my personal ability is limited, so I must unite with technical personnel and learn more from the advanced veteran comrades. I hope everyone will unite and complete the glorious task of promotion.

### 我要团结技术人员坚决地推广“一九五一织布工作法”

    我要团结技术人员坚决地推广“一九五一织布工作法”
    天津市一等劳动模范  姜淑英
    全国织布工作法会议对我的影响很大。我平常光知道干活，也不知道什么叫工作法。后来我们厂里的何技师用他的理论帮助我研究、总结了我的工作法。在总结中他告诉我那点是好方法，那点不是好方法。这次全国织布工作法会议集中了全国劳动模范的先进经验和技术人员的理论。在会议中还让大家到车上去表演，好让大家看看到底那点好那点不好，然后提出来大伙研究讨论。经过二十多天的功夫，“一九五一织布工作法”就胜利地总结出来了。
    经过这次大会，我更明白了，要是光凭工人干活，技术人员不用理论帮助我们，我们的技术水平就不能提高；同样的，要是光凭技术人员写一套方法，叫工人去干，也是不合实际的，所以也不行。工人和技术人员一定要结合起来，大家伙商量大家伙研究才能行。
    从前在厂里订爱国公约，我们总想多增产捐献，好支持我们的志愿军。后来我们又急着响应毛主席的增产节约号召，可是老没有好办法。这会儿可就行了。我们学会了“一九五一织布工作法”，又能节约，又能增产，不但能多看车，还不累得慌。以后我保证坚决地推广“一九五一织布工作法”，让天津市的织布工人都学会新的工作方法。大伙都学会了就能多增产节约，给国家积累更多的财富，支持我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。我要用克服困难推广“一九五一织布工作法”响应毛主席关于增产节约的号召。
    我知道我个人的能力有限，我一定要团结技术人员，还要向各位先进的老大哥、老大姐们多学习。我希望大家团结起来，完成光荣的推广任务。
