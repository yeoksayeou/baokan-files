Sweeping Away Pro-American Ideas in Science and Technology Books
-- A Review of Xu Jing's "Railway Statistics"
	Zeng Wenjing

In the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, pro-American, worship-America, and fear-America ideologies have been severely hit; however, some books related to science and technology still often permeate these reactionary ideas, which are very easy to mislead readers. "Railway Statistics" written by Xu Jing, a professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University, is a clear example.

This book of 200,000 words uses 60% of its content to peddle railway statistical methods from the US and Britain. The author almost prostrates himself in worship of American and British imperialism. In the preface to the revised edition written after liberation, he blindly praised the United States for "never having a disconnect between practice and theory." "Regarding the application of statistics in railways of various countries... the American railways are the most complete, with the most types, and the most widely used." On page 468 of the book, the author even absurdly believes that the language of the motherland cannot accurately express the true meaning of statistical terms. He said: "The content (referring to Chinese statistical terms) does not match the surface meaning of the words. It is not easy to reveal its hidden weaknesses without using English for comparison and analysis."

Since the author worships the United States so much, then his view of the People's China can be imagined. In the preface to the revised edition, he began by saying: "The current general economic situation in the country is more difficult than during the war." He lightly glossed over the economic decline and the suffering of the people caused by the Kuomintang reactionary government. As for the great achievements of the People's Government after liberation in stabilizing prices, restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production, and rapidly repairing the mainland railway network, he completely wrote them off!

Not only that, but when the book was published in its second edition after liberation, Xu Jing also specifically wrote Chapter 32, "Analysis and Discussion of China's Newly Revised Railway Freight Car Turnaround Rate and Related Measures," to oppose the Soviet Union's advanced methods currently used by the People's Railways. He began by saying: "The freight car turnaround rate is said to be designed by Soviet experts and has already caused a sensation across the country and has aroused widespread attention in academic circles. However, because the methods are complicated and the details have not been clearly stipulated and announced, it is difficult to obtain the complete truth." Although he didn't know the "details," because "advanced railways in the US and Britain have never had this," he arbitrarily concluded: "There are too many shortcomings, which do not conform to scientific principles, and will never be effective. It is not easy to implement and should not be implemented. It should be abolished as soon as possible." Such an arbitrary attitude is fundamentally contrary to the scientific spirit, which shows the seriousness of his blind worship of American and British imperialism. However, the facts are better than his sophistry. The "freight car turnaround rate" has now been recognized as one of the standards for measuring the performance of railway work.

Railway statistics reflect the operation and management of railways. In capitalist countries, the purpose of railway management, as Xu Jing said in the first section of the first chapter, is "to be able to stand in an invincible position in the modern competition of hundreds of industries and maintain its survival." However, this kind of management—the management of capitalists in a society in a state of anarchy—no longer exists in socialist and new democratic countries. Because the railways of socialist and new democratic countries are publicly owned, and their operation and management belong to the scope of planned economy, which is completely different from that of capitalist countries. Xu Jing completely doesn't understand this basic point. Take the "freight car turnaround rate" as an example. It is a major component of the planned transportation system, and it can only be produced and play its due role under the planned transportation system of socialist and people's democratic countries.

Because the planned freight car turnaround rate is based on the vehicle demand plan proposed by the cargo owner and referring to past statistical materials to formulate the average turnaround distance of freight cars, so as to estimate the number of freight cars used, ensure the most favorable transportation for the entire people's economy, reduce unnecessary transportation for the people's economy, and highly exert the transportation efficiency of the people's railways. This is completely possible to implement this method in socialist countries with public ownership of the means of production and in the new China where all railways are state-owned and the entire people's economy is gradually developing in a planned manner under the leadership of the state-owned economy.

We do not deny that Xu Jing did learn some production knowledge in the United States, but unfortunately he was also poisoned by the ideology of American imperialism. He is used to seeing the anarchic railway management monopolized by American and British financial capital and the railway statistics adapted to it. He doesn't know that outside the old world, there is also a new world where science and technology are booming. Like a bat, he is used to seeing darkness and the stars and moon, but under the sunshine, his weak eyesight can't see anything. Therefore, Xu Jing still insisted after liberation that American and British railway statistics, terminology, and even "all facilities" are good, and that the freight car turnaround rate must be bad and unusable since the US and Britain "have never had this." In this way, Xu Jing has become an obligatory imperialist cultural peddler. However, he has no self-awareness. He even claims that "in his life, he has studied various railway transportation issues, regardless of engineering management, and has always used a frank attitude and a completely selfless purpose to discover the truth, clarify the rights and wrongs, and dare not be negligent, without deliberately seeking fame, and even without slandering others." The depth of the poisoning is so deep!

Now the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals is being carried out, and we also need to carry out extensive criticism and self-criticism in the scientific and technological circles to sweep away ideas like Xu Jing's completely. Only by sweeping away this kind of bad thinking can scientific and technological workers be able to discover the truth, and science and technology can truly serve the people.

    扫除科学技术书籍中的崇美思想
    ——评许靖的“铁路统计学”
    曾文经
    在抗美援朝的爱国主义运动中，亲美、崇美、恐美的思想已受到严重的打击；但是某些有关科学技术一类的书籍中，仍然常常渗透着这些反动思想，十分容易贻害读者。上海交通大学教授许靖著的“铁路统计学”一书就是一个明显的例证。
    这本二十万字的书，用了百分之六十的篇幅来贩卖美英两国的铁路统计方法。作者对美英帝国主义几乎崇拜到五体投地的程度。在解放后作者所写的增订本序中，盲目歌颂着美国“从无实际与理论脱节之说”。“关于各国铁路应用统计……美国铁路最为完善，种类最多，运用最广。”该书第四百六十八页中，作者甚至荒谬地认为祖国的语言，不能确切表达统计术语的真实意义。他说：“其内容（指中文的统计术语）均与文字之表面不合，非用英文对照分析，不易显其暗含之弱点。”
    作者既然这样崇拜美国，那么，他对人民中国的看法就可想而知了。在增订本序中，他一开头就说：“现时国内一般经济情况，较战时更为艰窘。”他把国民党反动政府所造成的经济凋蔽和民不聊生的罪行轻轻放了过去，而对于解放后人民政府稳定物价、恢复和发展工农业生产，迅速修复大陆铁路网等的伟大成就，却一笔抹煞！
    不仅如此，在解放后该书出第二版时，许靖还特地写了第三十二章“我国新订铁路货车周转率及其有关办法之分析论”，来反对目前人民铁道所采用的苏联先进方法。他开始说：“货车周转率据云系由苏联专家设计，早已轰动全国各路，同时引起学界之普遍高度注意，惟因办法复杂，详情未经明文规定公布，难得全部真理。”他虽然不知道“详情”，但因“美英先进铁路不曾有此”，他就武断地下了结论：“缺点太多，不合科学原理，决无实效，既不易于推行，又不宜于推行，理应及早废止。”这样武断的态度，根本就和科学精神相反，足见其盲目崇拜美英帝国主义思想的严重程度。然而，事实胜过他的诡辩，目前“货车周转率”却已经被公认为衡量铁路工作成绩的标准之一了。
    铁路统计是反映铁路的经营管理的。在资本主义国家里，铁路管理的目的，正如许靖在第一章第一节所说，是“庶可于近代百业竞争局势之下立于不败之地位，而维持其生存”。然而这种管理——整个社会处在无政府状态下的资本家的管理——在社会主义和新民主主义的国家里已经不存在了。因为社会主义和新民主主义国家的铁路是公共所有的，它的经营管理是属于计划经济的范畴，是和资本主义国家截然不同的。这一个基本点许靖却完全不懂得。就拿“货车周转率”来说吧，它是计划运输制度中的主要组成部分，它只有在社会主义和人民民主国家的计划运输制度下才能产生，也才能发挥它应有的作用。
    因为计划货车周转率，就是根据货主所提出的需要车辆计划及参考以往统计材料，拟定货车平均周转距离，以便预计运用货车数目，保证对整个人民经济最有利的运输，减除对人民经济不必要的运输，高度发挥人民铁道的运输效能。这在生产资料公有制度的社会主义国家和铁路全部国有，整个人民经济在国营经济领导下逐渐获得有计划的发展的新中国，是完全有条件来实行这种办法的。
    我们不否认许靖在美国确实学到了若干生产知识，但不幸他同时又中了美国帝国主义的思想毒害，他看惯了美英财政资本垄断的无政府状态的铁路管理，和与此相适应的铁路统计，他不知道在旧世界之外，还另有一个科学技术蒸蒸日上的新世界。他像蝙蝠一样看惯了黑暗和星月，但在阳光普照下，他的微弱目力就什么也看不见了。所以许靖在解放后仍一口咬定美英的铁路统计、术语以至“所有设施”都是好的，货车周转率既是美英“不曾有此”，就一定不好，也就一定不能用。这么一来，许靖就成了义务性的帝国主义文化贩子了。然而他却毫无自知之明，他居然自称“生平研究各种铁路交通问题，不分工程管理，尝以坦率态度，一本大公无私之旨，掘发真理，阐明是非优劣，未敢稍有苟且，既无故意鸣高之心，更无诋毁他人之念。”中毒之深，一至如此！
    现在知识分子的思想改造运动正在开展，我们也需要在科学技术界进行广泛的批评和自我批评，来把像许靖这样的思想扫除得一干二净。只有扫除了这种坏思想，科学技术工作者才能够去掘发真理，科学技术才能真正为人民服务。
