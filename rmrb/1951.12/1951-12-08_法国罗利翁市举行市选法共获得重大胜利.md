(Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 3rd) According to a dispatch from the French Telegraphic Agency (Agence Telegraphique): The important French port and American military base in France, Lorient, held municipal elections on the 1st. The united front of the local Communist Party and Socialist Party organizations achieved a major victory. The elected mayor, two deputy mayors, and thirteen municipal council members are all members of the French Communist Party. Due to a prior agreement, Socialist Party voters all voted for Communist Party candidates.

The new mayor, Le Samer, was originally a technician at the Lorient arsenal and was dismissed by the Minister of the Navy four months ago for engaging in "peace activities."

    【新华社讯】据电通社巴黎三日讯：法国重要的港口和美国在法国的军事基地罗利翁在一日举行市政选举。共产党和社会党地方组织的联合阵线获得了重大胜利。当选的市长、两个副市长以及十三个市政委员都是法国共产党员。由于事先取得协议，社会党选民都投了共产党候选人的票。
    新市长勒萨麦弟原是罗利翁兵工厂的技师，四个月前因为从事“和平活动”而被海军部长免职。
