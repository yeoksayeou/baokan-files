    Peasants in Central and Southern China Enthusiastically Deliver Grain

    Editor: In many areas of Central and Southern China, peasants have launched an upsurge of paying patriotic grain and liberation grain. The peasants' patriotic enthusiasm has deeply moved me. In many places, the masses prepared the public grain even before the task was assigned to individual households. In this way, the grain requisition task can be completed in a very short time. For example, in Beixiang, Pingkou District, Guangfeng County, Jiangxi, 320,000 jin of public grain were paid in a short period of time; Shitou Township also quickly paid 150,000 jin of public grain, with no arrears. At the same time, the grain quality paid by the masses in these places is also good. Even grain delivered on cloudy days has low moisture content. Xiaolan Village, Nanchang County, even bought ninety sieves and sieved all the grain before sending it to the warehouse. Mi Dongxiang, a woman from Gufo Village, Shanxi District, Guangfeng County, used to have no food or clothing at home. After the land reform, her life improved, and she was very active in paying public grain. She specifically went to the city to buy a piece of red paper and asked a member of the work team to write the words "Chairman Mao is like our parents" on it and pasted it on the public grain bags before enthusiastically carrying the grain to delivery. Wang Fugui of Gecun Township said with emotion: "In the past, I cultivated so much land and had to pay 19 shi of rent. This year, I only need to pay 600 jin of public grain. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government, how could this be possible!"

    At present, the autumn grain requisition work in Central and Southern China is still continuing. In addition to mobilizing and organizing the masses to deliver grain and inspect grain quality, various places are also conducting in-depth and extensive propaganda and education, exposing the illegal activities of a small number of lawless landlords and counter-revolutionary elements in sabotage, spreading rumors, mixing sand and water into the grain, and burning public grain, and launching mass movements to protect the autumn requisition and warehouse protection work.

    中南区农民踊跃缴粮
    编辑同志：中南区有许多地方的农民掀起了缴纳爱国粮、翻身粮的热潮。农民的爱国热情，使我很受感动。许多地方在任务还没有布置到户时，群众就把公粮准备好了。这样，在很短的时间内，就能完成征粮任务。如江西广丰县萍口区北乡在短时间内，就缴完了三十二万斤公粮；石塘乡也很快缴完了十五万斤公粮，且无一尾欠。同时，这些地方的群众所缴粮质也好，即使在阴天缴的粮食，所含水分也少。南昌县小篮村还买了九十个筛子，把粮食全部筛过后才送入库。广丰县杉溪区古佛村妇女米冬香，过去家里衣食无着，土地改革后生活好了，对缴公粮十分积极。她特地跑到城里买了张红纸，请工作组同志写上“毛主席像爹娘”的话贴在公粮袋上，便一股劲地把粮挑送去。葛村乡王富贵感动地说：“过去我种这么多田，要交十九石租，今年只要缴六百斤公粮，要不是共产党、人民政府那能办到！”
    目前中南区秋征工作还在继续进行，各地除动员组织群众送粮和检查粮质外，并作深入广泛的宣传教育，揭发少数不法地主、反革命分子的破坏造谣、掺砂掺水、烧毁公粮等不法行动，展开群众性的保卫秋征与护仓工作。            任光
