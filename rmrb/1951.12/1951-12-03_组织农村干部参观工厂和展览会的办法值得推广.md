    The method of organizing rural cadres to visit factories
    and exhibitions is worth promoting
    Editor: From November 6th to 12th this year, 1,500 rural cadres from various parts of Shanxi Province were organized to visit seven factories directly related to agricultural production and some exhibitions in Taiyuan. They were warmly welcomed and treated by the worker brothers and the citizens. They also held many get-togethers and forums with the worker brothers, and listened to reports from leaders at all levels. All this greatly improved their understanding of industrial production and the city. Some of them said:
    "This is better than staying in school for five months." Hai Yun and Fa Gui from Gaoping County said, "This time we really know the greatness of the working class. Without them, we farmers would not reach socialism in ten thousand years." Before coming to Taiyuan, Wang Shengmao from Hongtong County had the idea of "retreating from the slope" and was unwilling to be a cadre. Now his thinking has changed, and he said: "I must lead the masses to develop production." Some of them made a promise to the workers face to face: "We will definitely take the lead in mobilizing the masses to sell all the stored cotton to the state when we go back." They unanimously pledged to completely convey what they saw and heard in Taiyuan to the masses after returning.
    In his article "Strengthening the Party's Political Work in Rural Areas" published at the end of June this year in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out: "Guiding them to visit modern factories and industrial product exhibitions organized by leading organs is the best classroom for educating farmers and Party members and cadres from peasant backgrounds to understand that the working class can act as the leader of the revolution." Now Shanxi has proved this with facts. I think this is worth promoting throughout the country.

    组织农村干部参观工厂
    和展览会的办法值得推广
    编辑同志：今年十一月六日到十二日，山西省各地有一千五百余农村干部有组织地到太原参观了与农业生产有直接关系的七个工厂和一些展览会。他们受到工人兄弟和市民群众的热烈欢迎和招待。他们又和工人兄弟举行了好多次联欢会、座谈会，还听了各级首长的报告。这一切使得他们对工业生产和城市的认识大大提高一步。他们中间有些人说：
    “这比住五个月学校还强”。高平县的海云和法贵说：“这回可真知道了工人阶级的伟大，没他们，叫咱农民一万年也到不了社会主义。”洪洞县王生茂来太原之前曾有“退坡”思想，不愿当干部，现在思想转变了，他说：“我一定要好好领导农民发展生产。”他们之中有些人当面对工人提出保证：“回去一定带头动员群众把所存棉花完全卖给国家。”他们并一致保证，回去后要把在太原所见所闻完全传达给群众知道。
    薄一波同志今年六月底在纪念中国共产党三十周年时发表的“加强党在农村中的政治工作”一文中曾指出：“引导他们多多参观近代化的大工厂和由领导机关举办的工业生产品展览会，这是教育农民和农民出身的党员和干部了解工人阶级能够充当革命的领导者的最好课堂。”现在山西已经用事实证明了这一点。我认为这是值得在全国各地推广的。
