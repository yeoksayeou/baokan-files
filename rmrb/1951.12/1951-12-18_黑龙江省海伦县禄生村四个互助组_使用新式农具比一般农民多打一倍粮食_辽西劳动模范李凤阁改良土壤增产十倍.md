    Four Mutual Aid Teams in Lusheng Village, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province,
    Harvest Double the Grain of Ordinary Farmers by Using New Farm Tools
    Li Fengge, Labor Model of Western Liaoning, Increases Production Tenfold by Improving the Soil
    Lusheng Village, Seventeenth District, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, under the guidance of the Technical Extension Station of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Northeast People's Government, used Soviet-style horse-drawn farm tools this year, saving labor, producing more efficiently, and harvesting more grain. This was warmly welcomed by the local people and laid a good foundation for the promotion of new farm tools next year.
    The Technical Extension Station guided four horse-drawn farm tool groups in this village this year. When planting wheat and soybeans with seeders in the spring, the tilling was deep, and the sowing was even, so the crops grew especially vigorously. The wheat grew to more than three feet high, the soybeans to two feet seven or eight inches high, the seeds were full, and they matured early, with the yield per hectare doubling that of ordinary farmers in the village. For example, Cui Wanlu harvested 5,100 jin of wheat from one and a half hectares planted with a seeder (equivalent to 3,400 jin per hectare), which was more than 1,700 jin more than local farmers. Half a hectare of soybeans yielded 4,200 jin, which was 2,000 jin more than ordinary farmland. Another example is the Wang Yongzhen mutual aid team, which had thirteen male laborers, fifteen female laborers, and thirteen horses, cultivating forty-two hectares of land. This year, because they were organized and used new farm tools for cultivation, they cultivated an additional twenty-two hectares of hazel scrub wasteland and also planted four additional hectares of multiple-crop land, and all achieved five plowings and five harrowings. In the autumn, they harvested an additional 51,500 jin of grain. The entire team used a threshing machine for threshing. Fifteen horses and twelve people took just over four days to thresh thirty-six hectares of soybeans. If the old method were used, five people and five horses could only thresh one hectare of soybeans per day. (Wang Jinwei)
    Li Fengge, a labor model in Zhongde Village, Shuangliao County, Liaoxi Province, improved sandy soil and increased production tenfold. Li Fengge had five hectares of sandy land, which was prone to spring drought due to the loose soil. When the spring wind blew, even the seeds and seedlings were blown away, and even the ridges were leveled. In the past, he worked hard for a year, and one hectare of land could only yield four or five dou of grain. Based on the experience that "black soil on sandy soil is worth twice as much per mu," he began to improve the soil in 1949. That year, he hauled more than 300 carts of black soil from the hemp retting pits to each hectare of sandy land. As the soil fertility increased, and the wind could no longer blow away the soil, the result was that one hectare of land yielded four shi of corn. In 1950, he continued to haul black soil to the land. By this year, this sandy land was almost the same as black land, and any crops could be planted. This year, seven mu of wheat yielded three shi; seven mu of soybeans yielded three shi and five dou; three and a half mu of potatoes yielded more than 6,000 jin; and three hectares and two mu of millet yielded fourteen shi. In total, five hectares of land yielded twenty shi and eight dou of grain, plus more than 6,000 jin of potatoes, with a yield ten times higher than before the soil was improved. (Li Su)

    黑龙江省海伦县禄生村四个互助组
    使用新式农具比一般农民多打一倍粮食
    辽西劳动模范李凤阁改良土壤增产十倍
    黑龙江省海伦县十七区禄生村，在东北人民政府农业部技术推广站指导下，今年使用苏联马拉农具，省工出活多打粮，受到当地群众热烈欢迎，给明年新式农具推广工作打下了良好基础。
    技术推广站今年在这个村领导了四个马拉农具组，春天用播种机种小麦和大豆时，耕得深，种得匀，庄稼长得特别旺盛。小麦长得有三尺多高，大豆二尺七、八寸高，籽粒饱满，熟得也早，每垧产量比该村一般农民的多一倍。如崔万禄用播种机种的一垧半小麦，收了五千一百斤（每垧折三千四百斤），比当地农民多打一千七百多斤。半垧大豆打四千二百斤，比一般农田多收二千斤。又如王永珍互助组，十三个男劳动力，十五个女劳动力，十三匹马，种四十二垧地；今年因为组织起来，使用新式农具耕种，多开二十二垧榛柴荒，还多种四垧多熟地，并都做到了五铲五趟，秋后多收了五万一千五百斤粮食。全组用脱谷机打场，十五匹马、十二个人，四天多工夫就打完了三十六垧地大豆，如果用旧法打，五个人五匹马，一天只能打一垧地的大豆。　（王锦威）
    辽西省双辽县种德屯劳动模范李凤阁，改良沙地土壤，增产十倍。李凤阁有五垧沙土地，因土质松，容易春旱，春风大了连种子和小苗都给刮走，甚至连垅台都被刮平。过去他辛辛苦苦地干一年，一垧地只能收四、五斗粮。他根据“沙土上黑土，一亩顶二亩”的经验，从一九四九年就开始改良土壤，那年往沙地里拉沤麻坑里的黑土每垧地达三百多车。由于地力增强，而且风也刮不起土了，结果一垧地打了四石苞米。一九五○年，他继续往地里拉黑土。到今年为止，这块沙地已经和黑土地差不多，任何庄稼都已可种植。今年种七亩小麦打了三石；七亩大豆打了三石五斗；三亩半土豆起了六千多斤；三垧二亩糜子打了十四石。总共五垧地打了二十石零八斗粮食，还有六千多斤土豆，产量比改良土壤以前增加了十倍。　（李甦）
