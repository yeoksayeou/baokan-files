    Visiting the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of Taihang and Taiyue
    By Our Special Correspondent, Shi Jiyan

    I recently accompanied the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Branch of the Central People's Government's Northern Old Revolutionary Base Areas Visiting Delegation on a visit to the former Taihang and Taiyue old revolutionary base areas. After fourteen years of revolutionary struggle and several years of production and construction since the land reform, the vast rural people in these two areas have made significant progress in terms of economy, politics, culture, and living standards. I will now explain this in several aspects:

    People's Production and Life are Getting Better Year by Year

    The Taihang and Taiyue old revolutionary base areas launched a production movement from 1940 onwards and later responded to Chairman Mao's call to organize. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945 and the completion of the land reform in 1948, production conditions became even more favorable. Through years of production campaigns, by 1950, agricultural production in general areas had recovered to pre-war levels, and many areas had even exceeded them. For example, in Wu'xiang County, the average yield per mu in 1950 (including some disaster-stricken villages) exceeded the pre-war level by 4.9 percent, while in Yangcheng County, it exceeded the pre-war level by 10 percent. The main reasons for the rapid recovery of production are: (1) the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government; (2) the increased enthusiasm of farmers for production after the land reform; (3) the liberation of the mainland and the restoration of transportation, which provided favorable conditions for the recovery of agricultural production; (4) the recovery of labor and livestock and the large-scale participation of women in field labor; (5) the development of labor mutual aid; and (6) the improvement of production technology and the prevention and control of pests and diseases.

    The recovery of labor and livestock is one of the important reasons for the recovery of production. The number of livestock in Yangcheng County exceeded the pre-war level by 9.5 percent, and in She County, it exceeded the pre-war level by 7.5 percent, doubling the number during the Anti-Japanese War. Although the number of male laborers is not as high as before the war (reaching about 70 percent of the pre-war level in Qin County and Zuoquan County), rural labor is generally not lacking due to the large-scale participation of women in field labor.

    The development of labor mutual aid is another important reason why agricultural production has reached pre-war levels. In Wu'xiang, Ping'shun, She County, Qinyuan, Yangcheng and other places, labor mutual aid has a long history; although there was a period of disintegration in 1949, the phenomenon of disintegration gradually overcame after the call of "organizing, improving technology, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and solving supply and marketing" was put forward in 1950. By 1951, labor mutual aid had developed further. This is mainly reflected in: the combination of mutual aid groups and political study, with reading newspapers becoming a common practice in many mutual aid groups; many mutual aid groups have accumulated public property, such as collectively buying large farm tools, repairing beaches, planting trees, buying sheep, and collecting righteousness granaries. In addition, many mutual aid groups have experienced the problem of surplus labor; in addition to improving farming techniques, they cannot find suitable jobs. For example, the Wang Jin'yun mutual aid group in Yaoshanggou, Wu'xiang County, has twenty-eight laborers, with a surplus labor force of more than 40 percent.

    Improving production technology has also played a significant role in restoring production. Farmers have largely become accustomed to processing (increasing from eleven workdays per mu before the war to thirteen to fifteen workdays now), fertilization, land improvement, seed selection, and seed soaking, and they have also developed great interest in new farm tools and scientific pesticides. There are already more than 1,000 seven-inch plows in the plains of Wu'an. Farmers in various places are asking the government to provide more new farm tools suitable for mountain use, various fine fertilizers, and insecticide machinery. Although fruit tree pests and diseases in Wu'an, She County, and Ci County have been actively controlled, they are still very serious, and the masses urgently request the government to help solve them. There are two problems in promoting new farm tools: one is that the seven-inch plow is not suitable for mountain use (small plots); the other is that there is a lack of technology to master the new farm tools. The masses ask the government to open more technical training classes, organize more visits, and establish farm tool repair stations to train repair workers.

    In addition to the rapid recovery of agricultural production in these two areas, animal husbandry and afforestation have also developed greatly, and pig and chicken farming have also increased. Before the war, Qinyuan County averaged less than one chicken per person and one pig per five households, but now it averages two chickens per person and one pig per two households. The smooth sale of local products last year and this year has greatly promoted mountain production. However, in terms of animal husbandry and afforestation, strong leadership and material assistance are still needed.

    With the recovery and development of production, farmers' lives have been greatly improved, and the lives of rural handicraft workers have improved even more. The masses happily told the comrades of the visiting delegation: "It's much better than when you were here in the past!" Food and clothing have generally exceeded pre-war levels. Even in areas where half the year was spent eating bran and vegetables in the past, eating bran has been greatly reduced. In general areas, liberated farmers have new clothes to change into for meetings and festivals. More and more farmers are sending their children to senior primary schools and secondary schools to study. Some farmers have surplus grain. A 1950 survey showed that households with more than three shi of surplus grain accounted for 28 percent of the total number of households in Xiyang County and 21 percent in Heshun County. However, the lives of the masses are still not prosperous enough, and they still feel difficulties in repairing houses (it is estimated that half of the houses burned down by the Japanese invaders have not been rebuilt), adding livestock, and treating diseases.

    In the recovery and rise of production and life, what farmers urgently require to solve is the restoration of transportation, the smooth flow of material exchanges, and the reduction of the price scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. In the Taihang and Taiyue mountainous areas, not only are there no trains or cars, but there are also no large carts; transportation basically relies on livestock, and in many places, it still relies on human carrying. For example, in Wu'xiang County, two-thirds of the long-distance transportation of public grain still relies on human carrying. Therefore, the masses are eager to build transportation. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, it directly affects the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, making grain and local products cheap and difficult to sell, and cloth and daily necessities expensive, making it even more difficult to transport coal, which increases the price scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. In order to appropriately reduce the price scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products, it is very necessary to repair mountain transportation in a planned way. In repairing transportation, in addition to railways and highways being planned uniformly by the central government and provinces, special commissioner offices and county governments should plan to build large cart roads and organize the masses to develop various vehicles, even iron-wheeled carts pulled by cattle or hand-pushed carts are better than human carrying. Repairing transportation is not only related to the exchange of materials and the further development of mountain production, but also creates convenient conditions for "politics going to the countryside," "science and technology going to the countryside," and "culture going to the countryside." When the visiting delegation went to Zhuanbi Village in Wu'xiang County, where Commander-in-Chief Zhu De once lived, it was originally planned to show a movie. However, because the 400-jin generator could not be transported in the mountains, the movie did not happen. Telephones in mountain counties are not working, and there are no telephones from county towns to the districts. Inconvenient transportation, coupled with unreliable telephones, makes it easy to become politically isolated. Therefore, all localities are also urgently requesting to solve the telephone problem. The production and living difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled soldiers are getting smaller year by year.

    In each county, the visiting delegation convened symposiums with representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled soldiers, and conducted many individual visits. The materials obtained by each group in various places are generally consistent. The reflections of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled soldiers are: substitute farming work is getting better year by year, and production and living difficulties are getting smaller year by year, and this year's substitute farming work has made significant progress compared to previous years. Their lives can be specifically analyzed into three situations: the living conditions of some revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled soldiers are similar to those of the general masses and can gradually improve; most households can maintain food and clothing, but have no savings, and feel difficulties in repairing houses, seeing doctors, and attending school; and a very small number of households feel that food and clothing are not enough. There are generally three types of substitute farming methods, namely, contract output system, contract labor system, and allocated labor system. Along the Tongpu Railway in Taiyue and in Wu'an and She County in Taihang, a balanced substitute farming method has been implemented with the county or district as the scope. As for the political respect and spiritual comfort for revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled soldiers, it has been better than in previous years since the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, but it still has not reached the proper level. This is a big problem. The lack of political and spiritual respect for revolutionary martyrs' families and disabled soldiers is a reflection heard everywhere by the visiting delegation, especially the disabled soldiers. In the future, the leading organs in various places should strengthen the political education of cadres and the masses on "it is most glorious to be a soldier of the People's Liberation Army (Volunteer Army)," establish the idea, atmosphere, and morality that "it is most glorious to be a soldier of the People's Liberation Army," so that everyone respects the People's Liberation Army, everyone respects the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers. On the other hand, strengthening political education for revolutionary martyrs' families and disabled soldiers, and organizing them to participate in production as much as possible, is also very important. This aspect has not been done well enough in the past.

    "If Production Grows an Inch, Culture Must Also Grow an Inch"

    "Cultural emancipation, prosperity for both people and wealth," has become an urgent demand of farmers after the recovery of production and the improvement of living standards. They say: "If production grows an inch, culture must also grow an inch." In recent years, school education and farmer education in various counties have developed greatly, and young men and women have a high enthusiasm for attending literacy classes, and their achievements are also great. The masses in Xiliaocheng, She County, run a rural library on their own, raising funds to buy 500 kinds of books. Every mutual aid group in Tongyu and Matian villages in Zuoquan County subscribes to the Shanxi Peasant Daily or the Shanxi Daily. In terms of school education, various places feel that development cannot keep up with the demands of farmers. Generally, only 40 to 50 percent of school-age children in various places enter primary schools. Due to insufficient local educational funds, mountain villages with fewer than 25 school-age children cannot set up schools, which the masses have strong opinions on. The masses in Tunliu and Qingshui complain that their children cannot go to school, saying: "The old illiteracy has not been eliminated, and new illiteracy is growing." The masses in Changjie Village (70 households) in Qin County asked the visiting delegation to report to Chairman Mao, requesting the establishment of a senior primary school in their village. The biggest difficulties in running schools are the lack of teachers and the lack of funds. More than 540 students in Qinyuan Chengguan have only 18 rooms. When it rains, students hold umbrellas to attend classes. Students sit on the teachers' heated brick beds, and the teachers' bedding is hung on the beams. Zuoquan County has only 500,000 jin of local grain, and education expenses alone require 1.5 million jin. Among the 200 teachers in Yushe County, 80 have very low cultural levels. And generally, primary school teachers are not at ease with their work due to low economic treatment (monthly salary of 165-185 jin of millet). According to the Wu'xiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, 80 percent of primary school teachers are not at ease with their work. To solve this problem, first of all, leaders at all levels must fully recognize the importance of education in national construction, attach importance to the training of teachers, and find ways to solve funding difficulties. The solutions to funding difficulties are: one is to appropriately increase the local grain surcharge and make appropriate adjustments within the province; the other is to allow each village to find its own way to solve the problems of school buildings and equipment, or to establish private schools with government assistance. Regarding the problem of children in mountain villages attending school, the itinerant teaching system should be promoted.

    Wherever the visiting delegation went, it saw that the masses needed cultural entertainment as if they were thirsty. The performing arts team and film team of the visiting delegation performed in various places, with audiences of tens of thousands or even more than 50,000 people each time, generally breaking the record for the number of people attending gatherings in the local area. Some people ran dozens of miles to watch, and many old ladies rode donkeys to watch movies. In order to meet the masses' demands for cultural entertainment, on the one hand, various counties should strengthen the leadership of literary and artistic work, especially the work of county drama troupes, rural drama troupes, and radio broadcasts to the countryside; on the other hand, various cities should accept the experience of the visiting delegations to Korea and the central visiting delegations to the countryside, and frequently organize performing arts to the countryside, drama troupes to the countryside, and films to the countryside. This is not only a matter of culture going to the countryside, but also a matter of politics going to the countryside and science and technology going to the countryside. Ren Qingmei, a model worker in Wu'an, watched the film "Michurin" in Baoding. After returning, he promoted it everywhere, and nearby villages knew Michurin's name, which greatly promoted afforestation. And the film itself is science. Many people who have watched films, especially colorful and sound films, believe in the greatness of science.

    In addition, the masses demand prosperity for both people and wealth and demand strengthening rural medical and health work. The masses reflect that they cannot find a doctor when they are sick, or the doctor cannot cure the disease. The infant mortality rate in Anze in 1950 reached 60 percent, and the number of infant deaths in the first district of Yangcheng County from June to August this year reached 400. The solutions to this problem are: first of all, we should strengthen health propaganda, especially the propaganda of maternal and child health, vigorously carry out mass health and epidemic prevention campaigns, establish the idea that "prevention is better than cure," and call on the masses to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. Secondly, we should strengthen the leadership of public and private hospitals and medical associations in various counties, call on all public and private Chinese and Western doctors to strengthen the concept of serving the people, and train existing doctors and train midwives. The province should send medical teams to the countryside regularly for mobile treatment. In addition, the masses' request to set up more veterinary stations to reduce livestock deaths should also be paid attention to.

    Special Attention Should be Paid to Strengthening Political Work in Old Revolutionary Base Areas

    During the 40-day visit, the visiting delegation felt that the biggest problem was that our political work had not kept up with the rapid economic recovery in the countryside. The agricultural production in the Taihang and Taiyue old revolutionary base areas in the future is no longer a matter of recovery, but a matter of how to develop and adapt to the overall economic requirements to improve agricultural production. However, because our political work in the countryside has not kept up with the rapid economic recovery in the countryside, in the past two or three years, there has indeed been a tendency to not ask about politics in the countryside, and there has been a phenomenon of thin political atmosphere. This phenomenon has undergone great changes since the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the patriotic consciousness of the people has greatly improved; but it has not been enough. For example, a few party and league members are unwilling to participate in mutual aid groups, and mutual aid groups have shrunk in some areas (such as the old revolutionary areas of Ci County and Zanhuang County); cotton farmers and even party members store cotton without selling it, only caring about production and getting rich, ignoring national interests and difficulties; there is still formalism in signing patriotic covenants; insufficient political and spiritual respect for revolutionary martyrs' families and disabled soldiers; the publicity and education of the marriage law is very poor in some areas, and the buying and selling of marriage has resurfaced in some areas in the past two or three years, and cadres have turned a blind eye to the oppression of women, etc. all these facts can explain.

    The most important reason for the thin political atmosphere is that our political and ideological leadership over the old revolutionary base areas (especially the mountains) has weakened compared with before the national victory. First of all, the leading organs have entered the city, the troops (also political work teams) have fought far away, and a large number of old cadres have been transferred out. Secondly, the leading focus of many special commissioner offices and county governments is more on the plains, and not enough attention is paid to the mountains. In addition, some cadres are unwilling to work in the mountainous areas, so the mountainous areas have become "large districts, long roads, and few cadres," and many problems of the people cannot be reflected and solved in a timely manner. In addition, the general cultural and theoretical level of rural cadres is low, and many tasks and policies are not clearly explained, which also affects the strengthening of leadership in the old revolutionary base areas.

    In order to carry forward the glorious traditions of the old revolutionary base areas and enable the old revolutionary base areas to play an active and leading role in various tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the old revolutionary base areas, implement Chairman Mao's spirit of attaching importance to the leadership of the old revolutionary base areas; and according to the special circumstances of the mountainous areas, clearly put forward the production policy for the mountainous areas. Areas that have been particularly severely damaged by the war should also be supported.

    The old revolutionary base areas during the Anti-Japanese War were generally mountainous areas. Their characteristics are: they are politically advanced, economically and culturally relatively weak, and transportation is inconvenient. Because economic and cultural foundations are weak, and transportation is inconvenient, if political and ideological leadership is not particularly strengthened, it will inevitably relatively limit political progress. Therefore, strengthening political and ideological leadership and strengthening rural political work is of particular importance to the old revolutionary base areas.

    访问太行太岳老根据地
    本报特约记者  史纪言
    我这次随中央人民政府北方老根据地访问团晋冀鲁豫分团访问了原太行太岳老根据地。这两个地区经过十四年的革命斗争和土地改革后几年来的生产建设，广大的农村人民，在经济、政治、文化、生活各方面，都有显著提高。现在分几个问题来说明：
    人民生产生活一年比一年好
    太行、太岳老根据地，从一九四○年起就开展生产运动，后又响应毛主席号召组织起来。一九四五年抗日战争胜利，一九四八年土地改革结束，生产条件更加有利。经过历年来的生产运动，到一九五○年，一般地区农业生产已恢复到战前水平，而且有不少地区已经超过。例如武乡，一九五○年全县
    （包括部分受灾村在内）每亩平均产量超过战前百分之四点九，阳城全县超过战前百分之十。生产迅速恢复的几个主要原因是：（1）共产党和人民政府的领导；（2）土地改革后农民生产积极性的提高；（3）全国大陆解放，交通恢复，给恢复农业生产以有利条件；（4）劳动力畜力的恢复和妇女大量参加田间劳动；（5）发展了劳动互助；（6）提高生产技术和防治病虫害。
    劳畜力的恢复是生产恢复的重要原因之一。阳城全县牲畜数超过战前百分之九点五，涉县超过战前百分之七点五，比抗日战争期间增加一倍。男劳动力虽不如战前多（沁县、左权约达战前百分之七十），但由于妇女大量参加田间劳动，农村劳力一般是不缺的。
    发展劳动互助是农业生产量达到战前水平的另一个重要原因。武乡、平顺、涉县、沁源、阳城等地，劳动互助已有多年历史；一九四九年，虽然曾经一度发生涣散现象，但是自从一九五○年提出“组织起来，提高技术，农副结合，解决供销”的号召以后，涣散现象就逐渐克服了。到一九五一年，劳动互助又有新的发展。这主要表现在：互助组和政治学习相结合，不少互助组内读报已成风气；不少互助组内积累了公共财产，像集体买大农具、修滩、造林、买羊、集义仓等。此外，不少互助组已发生劳动力过剩问题；除提高农作技术外，找不到适当工作门路。例如武乡窑上沟王锦云互助组，有二十八个劳动力，剩余劳动力在百分之四十以上。
    提高生产技术在恢复生产上所起的作用也很显著。农民对加工（战前每亩地十一个工，现增至十三至十五个工）、加肥、修地、选种、浸种等方面，大都成为习惯，对新式农具和科学农药也发生极大兴趣。武安平地已有七吋步犁一千多张。各地农民均要求政府多供给适合山地使用的新式农具、各种细肥、杀虫药械等。武安、涉县、磁县一带，果木树病虫害虽经积极除治，但是仍然十分严重，群众迫切要求政府帮助解决。推广新式农具中有两个问题：一是七吋步犁不适于山地（地块小）使用；一是缺乏掌握新式农具的技术。群众要求政府多开技术训练班，多组织参观，并设立农具修理站，训练修理工人。
    这两个地区除农业生产恢复很快外，牧畜、造林都有很大发展，养猪、养鸡也都有增加。沁源战前平均每人不到一只鸡，五户一口猪，现在平均每人两只鸡，两户一口猪。去年和今年土产推销顺利，给山区生产以很大推动。但在畜牧、造林方面，还须领导上大力提倡和物质协助。
    在生产恢复和发展的情况下，农民生活已经有很大的改善，农村手工业工人生活提高得更多。群众都高兴地对访问团的同志说：“比你们过去在时好得多了！”吃饭穿衣一般已超过战前水平。即使是过去糠菜半年粮的地区，吃糠也已经大为减少。一般地区，翻身农民开会过节都已有新衣可换了。越来越多的农民送子弟上高小和中学求学。部分农民有了余粮，一九五○年调查：昔阳县余粮三石以上户占总户数百分之二十八，和顺县占百分之二十一。但群众生活仍不够富裕，在修盖房屋（被日寇烧毁的房屋估计还有一半没修起）、添置牲口、治疗疾病等方面仍然感觉困难。
    在生产恢复生活上升中，农民迫切要求解决的是修复交通，畅通物资交流，减缩工农业产品价格的剪刀差额。在太行、太岳山区里，不仅不通火车、汽车，而且不通大车；运输基本上靠牲口驮，不少地方仍然靠人担。像武乡，远途运输公粮仍有三分之二靠人担。因此，群众渴望修建交通。由于交通不便，直接影响了城乡物资交流，粮食和土产贱而且推销不易，布匹和日用品贵，运煤更感困难，这样就加大了工农业产品的剪刀差额。为了适当缩小工农业产品剪刀差额，有计划地修复山地交通是十分必要的。在修复交通中，除铁路、公路由中央和省统一计划外，各专署、县政府应有计划地修建大车路，并组织群众发展各种车辆，即使是牛拉的铁轮车或手推小车也比人担好。修整交通不仅关系着物资交流和进一步发展山区生产，而且也是为“政治下乡”“科学技术下乡”“文化下乡”创造便利条件。访问团这次到朱总司令住过的武乡砖璧村时，原计划演电影。但是因为四百斤重的发电机在山地无法运送，结果没有演成。山地各县电话不灵，县城到区间没有电话。交通不便，加以电话不灵，政治上很容易闭塞。因此，各地也迫切要求解决电话问题。革命烈属、军属、残废军人生产生活的困难一年比一年小
    在各县，访问团都召集了革命烈、军属和残废军人的代表座谈会，并进行了许多个别访问。各组在各地得到的材料大体一致。革命烈军属、残废军人的反映是：代耕工作一年比一年好，生产生活困难一年比一年小，今年的代耕工作比往年又有显著进步。他们的生活，具体分析有三种情况：烈军属、残废军人一部分户生活情况和一般群众差不多，可以逐步上升；大部分户吃穿能够维持，但没有积蓄，修房、医病、上学感到困难；极少数户吃穿都感到不够。代耕方法一般有三种，即包产制、包工制、拨工制。太岳同蒲沿线及太行武安、涉县等地，已实行以县或区为范围的平衡代耕办法。至于对烈军属、残废军人政治上的尊重和精神上的安慰，抗美援朝以来已较往年为好，但仍然没有达到应有的程度。这是一个大问题。对于革命烈军属、残废军人政治上精神上尊重不够，是访问团到处听到的反映，特别是残废军人反映最多。今后各地领导机关应该对干部群众加强“当解放军（志愿军）最光荣”的政治教育，树立“当解放军最光荣”的思想、风气和道德，使人人尊敬解放军，人人尊敬烈军属和残废军人。另一方面，加强对烈军属、残废军人的政治教育，组织他们尽可能地参加生产，也是很重要的。这方面过去做得也不够。
        “生产长一寸，文化也要长
    一寸”
    “文化翻身，人财两旺”，已成为农民在生产恢复、生活改善后的迫切要求。他们说：“生产长一寸，文化也要长一寸。”各县学校教育、农民教育数年来有很大发展，青年男女上民校情绪很高，成绩也很大。涉县西辽城群众自办农村图书馆，集资买书五百种。左权桐峪、麻田等村每个互助组都订有山西农民报或山西日报。在学校教育上各地均感发展赶不上农民要求。各地初小入学儿童一般仅达学龄儿童百分之四十至五十。由于地方教育经费不够，学龄儿童不足二十五个的山庄小村不能设立学校，群众对这一点很有意见。屯留、沁水群众埋怨孩子上不了学说：“老文盲没有扫清，小文盲又在生长。”沁县长街村（七十户）群众要求访问团转报毛主席，要求在本村设立高小。办学校中最大的困难是缺教员、缺经费。沁源城关五百四十多名学生只十八间房子，下雨时学生撑着伞上课，学生坐在教员炕铺上，教员的铺盖吊在梁上。左权地方粮只五十万斤，教育经费一项即需一百五十万斤。榆社二百个教员，有八十个文化程度极低。且一般小学教师由于经济待遇低（月薪小米一六五——一八五斤），大部分工作不安心。据中共武乡县委反映：小学教员中有百分之八十不安心工作。解决这一问题，首先必须使各级领导充分认识教育工作在国家建设中的重要性，重视培养师资，设法解决经费困难。解决经费困难的办法：一个是适当增加地方粮附加，再在全省范围加以适当调剂；一个是允许各村自想办法，解决校舍和设备，或建立民办公助的小学。关于山庄小村儿童上学问题，应推广巡回教学制。
    访问团所到的地方，看到群众需要文化娱乐，如饥如渴。访问团的曲艺队、电影队在各地出演，每次观众上万人以至五万多人，一般地都打破了当地群众集会人数的纪录。有跑数十里去看的，不少老太太骑驴看电影。为满足群众文化娱乐要求，一方面各县应该加强对文学艺术工作的领导，特别是县剧团、农村剧团、收音机下乡等工作；一方面各城市应当接受赴朝慰问团和中央访问团下乡经验，经常组织曲艺下乡、剧团下乡、电影下乡。这不仅是文化下乡问题，而且也是政治下乡，科学技术下乡问题。武安劳动模范任清美，在保定看了影片“米邱林”，回去后到处宣传，附近村庄都知道米邱林的名字，对植树造林有很大推动作用。而且电影本身就是科学，许多群众看了电影，特别是五彩、有声电影，都相信了科学的伟大。
    另外，群众要求人财两旺，要求加强农村医药卫生工作。群众反映有病请不到医生，或者有医生看不好病。安泽一九五○年婴儿死亡率达百分之六十，阳城一区今年六至八月死亡婴儿达四百人。解决这一问题的办法：首先应加强卫生宣传，尤其是妇幼卫生的宣传，大力开展群众性的卫生防疫运动，确立“防胜于治”的思想，号召群众讲求清洁卫生，减少传染病的流行。其次应加强各县公私医院及医联会的领导，号召所有公私中西医生，加强为人民服务的观念，并训练现有医生，训练助产婆。省里要派医疗队经常下乡，巡回治病，另外，群众要求多设兽医站，减少牲畜死亡，也应引起注意。
    应特别注意加强老根据地农村
    的政治工作
    在四十天的访问中，访问团感到最大的一个问题，就是在农村经济迅速恢复中，我们的政治工作没有跟上。太行、太岳老根据地今后的农业生产，已经不是恢复的问题，而是如何发展并适应整个经济要求提高改进农业生产的问题了。可是，由于在农村经济迅速恢复中，我们在农村中的政治工作还没有跟上，因而近两三年来，农村中确实滋生着一种不问政治的倾向，存在着政治空气稀薄的现象。此种现象，自抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动以来，已经有了很大的转变，人民群众的爱国主义觉悟已经大大提高了一步；但还没有足够的转变。比如少数党团员不愿参加互助组，某些地区（如磁县、赞皇老区）互助组萎缩；棉农甚至党员存棉不售，只顾生产发家，忽视国家利益与困难；订爱国公约仍然有形式主义的现象；对革命烈军属和残废军人在政治上、精神上尊重不够；某些地区对婚姻法的宣传教育很差，部分地区买卖婚姻近二、三年又显抬头，以及妇女的被压迫而干部竟熟视无睹等等事实，都可以说明。
    产生政治空气稀薄的原因，最主要的，是我们对老根据地（特别是山地）的政治领导和思想领导比较全国胜利前减弱了。首先，领导机关进城了，部队（也是政治工作队）打远了，老干部大量外调了。其次，不少专署和县政府的领导重点，多注意平川，对山地照顾不够，加以某些干部不愿到山区工作，因而山区形成“区大路远干部少”，人民群众许多问题不能及时地反映和解决。此外，农村干部一般文化理论水平低，许多工作和政策交代不清楚，也影响了对老根据地领导的加强。
    为了发扬老根据地的光荣传统，使老根据地在各种工作中起积极作用和带头作用，必须加强对老根据地的政治领导和思想领导，把毛主席重视对老根据地领导的精神贯彻下去；并根据山区特殊情况，明确提出山区生产方针。对于战争创伤特别严重的地区，还应该扶持一把。
    抗日时期的老根据地，一般都是山岳地区。它们的特点是：在政治上是先进的，在经济力量上和文化基础上是比较薄弱的，交通是不便的。因为经济力量和文化基础薄弱，加以交通的不便，如果不特别加强政治领导和思想领导，必然会相对地限制了政治上的进步。因此，加强政治领导和思想领导，加强农村政治工作，对老根据地说来，又具有特别重要的意义。
