    The German People's Democratic Unification Movement Brook No Illegal Interference
    At the United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee on the 11th, the representative of the German Democratic Republic delegation, Bolz, delivered a speech opposing the United States, Britain, and France's plot to use the United Nations to obstruct the holding of all-German elections. He advocated for the immediate convening of an all-German conference to arrange all-German elections and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Bolz's speech fully conformed to the spirit of all international agreements regarding the German issue and expressed the German people's deep desire to achieve peaceful unification.
    In early November, the United States, Britain, and France forcibly submitted the German issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion and advocated the formation of a so-called United Nations committee to conduct investigations throughout Germany to determine whether all-German elections could be held. This is a conspiracy by the United States, Britain, and France to undermine and delay the German people's democratic unification movement, and it is completely illegal. According to the principles of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has no right to interfere with the internal affairs of a nation. According to the Potsdam Agreement and all other international agreements concerning the German issue, the United Nations General Assembly also has no right to discuss the German issue, which should be handled and resolved by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, who bear primary responsibility for the German issue. The actions of the United States, Britain, and France in forcing the United Nations to discuss and handle the German issue are sufficient to expose their violation of international agreements and their attempt to delay all-German elections in order to continue their conspiracy to arm West Germany.
    More than six years after the end of the war against Germany, the German issue should have been reasonably resolved long ago. However, due to the United States, Britain, and France consistently pursuing a criminal policy of splitting Germany and remilitarizing West Germany, Germany has not yet been able to achieve democratic unification. The German people, who suffered greatly from the disasters of war in the two World Wars, are unwilling to be driven by Western imperialist countries as tools of war again. Since last December, when the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, proposed to the West German authorities to hold negotiations to establish an all-German constitutional conference, the German people's movement for democratic unification has been growing day by day. The German people have demonstrated their strong desire for peace, democracy, and unification through actions such as voting against rearmament and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and through actions of enthusiastically supporting Grotewohl's proposal. However, the American and British imperialists completely disregard this fact and want to use the United Nations signboard to conduct an "investigation" to obstruct the German people's democratic unification movement. This is naturally resolutely opposed by the German people and peace-loving people all over the world.
    It is very clear that the German issue can only be reasonably resolved by signing a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, and by holding all-German elections and implementing democratic unification in accordance with the wishes of the German people.
    If the American and British imperialists insist on violating international agreements and the wishes of the German people, and implement their criminal policy of arming West Germany and interfering with and monopolizing the German people's unification movement, then they will once again expose themselves before the German people and the people of the world as enemies of German democratic unification, and will be met with even stronger opposition from the German people and the people of the world.

### 德国人民的民主统一运动是不容非法干涉的

    德国人民的民主统一运动是不容非法干涉的
    德意志民主共和国代表团代表博尔茨十一日在联合国大会特别政治委员会上发表演说，反对美、英、法三国企图利用联合国来阻挠德国举行全德选举的阴谋，主张立即举行全德会议以安排全德选举，并要求缔结对德和约。博尔茨的讲话，完全符合于有关德国问题的一切国际协议的精神，并且表达了德国人民要求实现和平统一的深切愿望。
    美、英、法三国在十一月上旬强制将德国问题提交联合国大会讨论，并主张成立所谓联合国委员会在德国全境进行调查，以确定是否可以举行全德选举。这是美、英、法三国破坏和拖延德国人民民主统一运动的阴谋，它是完全非法的。根据联合国宪章的原则，联合国无权干涉一个民族自己内部的事务；根据波茨坦协定和其他一切有关德国问题的国际协议的规定，联合国大会也无权讨论德国问题，而应由对德国问题负主要责任的苏、美、英、法四国来处理和解决。美、英、法三国强制联合国讨论和处理德国问题的行为，适足以暴露出它们违反国际协议，企图拖延全德选举，以继续进行武装西德的阴谋。
    在对德战争已经结束了六年多的今天，德国问题本来早就应该获得合理的解决的。但是由于美、英、法三国一贯执行着分裂德国和使西德重新军国主义化的罪恶政策，使德国至今还不能实现民主统一。在两次世界大战中，饱受战争灾难的德国人民是不愿意再被西方帝国主义国家驱使来作为战争工具的。自去年十二月德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥向西德当局提出举行谈判以成立全德立宪会议的建议以来，德国人民要求民主统一的运动就一天天高涨起来。德国人民已经用投票反对重新武装和要求缔结对德和约的行动，用热烈拥护格罗提渥建议的行动表明了他们要求和平、民主、统一的强烈愿望。但是美英帝国主义竟完全无视这种事实，而要用联合国的招牌来进行一番“调查”，借此阻碍德国人民的民主统一运动。这自然是德国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所坚决反对的。
    事情很显然，德国问题只有根据波茨坦协定的规定早日签订对德和约，并按照德国人民自己的愿望举行全德选举，实行民主统一，德国的问题才能得到合理的解决。
    如果美英帝国主义一定要违反国际协定和德国人民的愿望，而实行它们武装西德，并对德国人民的统一运动进行干涉和包办的罪恶政策，那末它们就会再一次地在德国人民和全世界人民面前暴露它们是德国民主统一的敌人，将受到德国人民和世界人民更为强烈的反对。
