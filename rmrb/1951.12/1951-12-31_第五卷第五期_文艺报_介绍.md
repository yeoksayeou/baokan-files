The rectification and study movement in Beijing's literary and art circles has entered the stage of launching criticism and self-criticism, and conducting in-depth examination of literary and artistic thought and work. The fifth issue of Volume Five of "Literary Gazette" published articles of criticism and self-criticism by some leading comrades and literary and art workers in this stage, and commented on the situation of literary and artistic criticism in other regions and the problems existing therein.

The review articles published in "Literary Gazette" by Zhang Geng and others specifically criticized the shortcomings and errors in literary and artistic thought and work, and analyzed the root causes of the errors in a relatively profound way. Zhang Geng pointed out that the most serious mistake in the work of the Central Academy of Drama in the past two years was detachment from politics, detachment from reality, and detachment from Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, allowing petty-bourgeois and even bourgeois ideas to prevail. Film worker Lü Ban and art worker Ren Qianqiao respectively reviewed their petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness and the erroneous tendency to unilaterally pursue artistic skills. Wang Yaping also reviewed his crude production in creation, the lack of profound ideological content in his works, and even principled political errors, and linked it with the criticism of the errors of Beijing's popular literary and artistic work and creation in being divorced from the masses and simply applying old forms. Huang Gang specifically pointed out some of the problems existing in the current film industry. He believes that the widespread and profound criticism and self-criticism in this rectification and study are one of the keys to solving the problems.

Zhou Wen's "'On Practice' and the Problem of Reflection in Literature and Art" elaborates in detail on the issue of how literature and art reflect reality, which is helpful in promoting literary and art workers to study Mao Zedong Thought.

In the readers' opinions published in "Literary Gazette," it was pointed out that Shanghai's literary and artistic work has shown a very painful ideological confusion in the past two years. Many bad works such as the films "The Life of Wu Xun," "Between Us Husband and Wife," and "Company Commander Guan" were all filmed in Shanghai, but the Shanghai literary and art circles, especially the leaders of literary and art, have not conducted a more in-depth analysis and discussion of these serious errors and shortcomings. This reader hopes that the Shanghai literary and art circles will also quickly conduct a rectification and study, widely launch criticism and self-criticism, and earnestly improve their work.

"Literary Gazette" made a stern criticism of the current phenomenon of some people not paying attention to or even resisting criticism and self-criticism. Reader Jiang Suoming specifically pointed out that the editorial department of "People's Literature" is very lacking in the spirit of self-criticism regarding its own work. "People's Literature" has published many works with serious errors, such as "Between Us Husband and Wife," "Transformation," "The Story of Smoke," and "Old Worker Guo Fushan," but "has never made a more in-depth review." In addition, the article "Criticism of Fan Qixin's Erroneous Remarks in Kunming's Literary and Art Circles" criticized the leadership of Kunming's literary and artistic work and the wrong attitude towards mass criticism. When Kunming's literary and art circles widely launched criticism and discussion of Fan Qixin's erroneous remarks, the Kunming Federation of Literary and Art Circles not only failed to attach great importance to, encourage, and help it to go deeper, so as to clarify some of the erroneous ideas among Kunming's literary and art workers, but on the contrary, they were afraid of mass criticism and mistakenly obstructed and suppressed it. "Literary Gazette" pointed out that this is completely contrary to the spirit of the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 19, 1950, and this phenomenon should attract the attention of the leaders of literary and artistic work in various places.

This issue of "Literary Gazette" continues to publish readers' letters on "The Problem of Deviation in Literary and Artistic Teaching in Universities." These letters unanimously believe that the problems currently existing in literary and artistic teaching in universities are serious. Since "Literary Gazette" Volume Five, Issue Two raised this issue, it has generally aroused the attention of teachers and students in various universities. Some literary and artistic teachers have begun to study it in light of their own actual situations, humbly examine themselves, and some teachers have begun to make preliminary self-criticisms. This is good. However, some other teachers still lack a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism, lack ideological consciousness, and are unwilling to face up to the deviations that exist in their teaching. This erroneous view and practice should be corrected in a timely manner.

### 第五卷第五期“文艺报”介绍

    第五卷第五期“文艺报”介绍
    北京文艺界整风学习运动已进入展开批评和自我批评、深入检查文艺思想和文艺工作的阶段。“文艺报”五卷五期发表了这阶段一部分文艺界领导同志和文艺工作者的批评和自我批评的文章，并对其它地区文艺批评工作的情况及其中存在的问题，进行了评述。
    “文艺报”发表的张庚等的检讨文章，具体批判了文艺思想和工作中的缺点和错误，比较深刻地分析了错误的根源。张庚指出中央戏剧学院两年来工作中最严重的错误是脱离政治，脱离实际，脱离毛主席的文艺方向，让小资产阶级甚至资产阶级思想占了上风。电影工作者吕班和美术工作者任迁乔分别检讨了他们的小资产阶级思想意识和片面地追求艺术技巧的错误倾向。王亚平对于自己在创作上的粗制滥造、作品缺乏深刻的思想内容，甚至有原则性的政治错误，也进行了检讨，并联系批判了北京通俗文艺工作和创作中的脱离群众，单纯套用旧形式的错误。黄钢具体指出存在于目前电影界的一些问题，他认为这次整风学习中广泛展开深刻的批评和自我批评，是解决问题的关键之一。
    周文的“‘实践论’与文艺上的反映问题”详细地阐释了文艺怎样反映现实的问题，对于推动文艺工作者学习毛泽东思想是有帮助的。
    在“文艺报”发表的读者意见中，指出上海文艺工作两年来表现了令人非常痛心的思想上的混乱，许多坏作品如影片“武训传”、“我们夫妇之间”、“关连长”等都是在上海拍摄的，但上海文艺界，尤其文艺领导方面，却没有对这些严重的错误和缺点，进行过比较深刻地分析和讨论。这位读者希望上海文艺界也迅速进行一次整风学习，广泛展开批评和自我批评，认真改进工作。
    “文艺报”对目前某些不重视甚至抗拒批评和自我批评的现象，进行了严正的批评。读者姜素明具体指出，“人民文学”编辑部对于自己的工作，十分缺乏自我批评的精神，“人民文学”发表了不少有严重错误的作品，如“我们夫妇之间”、“改造”、“烟的故事”、“老工人郭福山”等，但“从来没有作过比较深刻的检讨”。此外，“昆明文艺界对范启新错误言论的批评”一文，对昆明文艺工作的领导方面和对待群众批评的错误态度，进行了批评。昆明文艺界在广泛展开对范启新错误言论的批评和讨论时，昆明文联不仅没有很好加以重视、鼓励和帮助，使之更加深入，以澄清昆明文艺工作者中间的一些错误思想，相反地，他们却害怕群众批评，并且错误地加以阻挠和压制。“文艺报”指出这是和中共中央一九五○年四月十九日发布的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”的精神完全相违背的，这种现象应引起各地文艺工作的领导方面的注意。
    这期“文艺报”继续发表了“关于高等学校文艺教学中的偏向问题”的读者来信，这些来信一致认为目前存在于高等学校文艺教学中的问题是严重的。“文艺报”五卷二期提出这问题以后，已普遍引起各高等学校的师生的重视。有的文艺教师已开始联系自己的实际情况，加以研究，虚心检查自己，有的教师并开始作了初步的自我检讨。这是好的。但另外有些教师对批评和自我批评还缺乏正确的认识，缺乏思想上的自觉，不愿正视自己教学中所存在的偏向，这种错误的看法和做法应得到及时的纠正。
