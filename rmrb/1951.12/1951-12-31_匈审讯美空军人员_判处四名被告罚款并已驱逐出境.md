Xinhua News Agency, December 27th, Budapest dispatch: The Hungarian News Agency reported that the Hungarian Budapest Military Court publicly tried on the 23rd the four personnel from the American military aircraft that intruded into Hungarian airspace on November 19th and were forced to land. The defendants Henderson, Swift, Duff, and Albert-Ilyem are all active-duty US military personnel. They confessed in court that the flight took place during the day with good visibility, and that they maintained contact with several different radio stations during the flight and knew they were flying in Hungarian airspace. They admitted this was deliberate negligence, but could not offer any explanation for the military operation maps of important Soviet regions, as well as maps of Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, field radio transceivers, extra parachutes, and a large number of bundled blankets ready to be dropped, which were equipped in the aircraft. They were obviously intending to use parachutes to drop these items to spies and saboteurs lurking in the people's democratic countries. Based on the facts and the defendants' confessions, the Budapest Military Court determined that the defendants deliberately intruded into Hungarian territory and sentenced each defendant to a fine of 360,000 forints (Hungarian currency), or three months imprisonment if the fine could not be paid. The American military aircraft that intruded into Hungarian territory and all items on board were confiscated.

Xinhua News Agency, December 30th, Budapest dispatch citing Hungarian News Agency news: The Hungarian government deported on the 28th the four personnel, including Henderson, from the American military aircraft that illegally intruded into Hungarian airspace on November 19th and were forced to land. The fine imposed on Henderson and others by the Hungarian Budapest Military Court on the 23rd has been paid by the US Embassy in Hungary.

    匈审讯美空军人员
    判处四名被告罚款并已驱逐出境
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯，匈牙利通讯社报道：匈牙利布达佩斯军事法庭二十三日公开审讯十一月十九日侵入匈牙利领空后被迫降落的美国军用飞机上的四个人员。被告亨德逊、斯微夫特、杜夫及阿尔伯—伊廉都是美国现役军人。他们在法庭上供认这次飞行是在白天进行的，能见度很好，在航行期间他们和几个不同的电台保持着联系，知道是在匈牙利领空飞行。他们承认这是故意的玩忽，但对于飞机上装备着苏联各重要地区的军事作战地图以及匈、罗、捷国的地图，野外使用的无线电收发报机，多余的降落伞和大量捆扎起来准备投下的毯子等，都不能作出任何解释。他们带着这些物品显然是想用降落伞投下给潜伏在人民民主国家内的间谍和破坏者的。布达佩斯军事法庭根据事实和被告的口供，确定被告等是故意侵入匈牙利国境，已判处被告每人罚款三十六万福林（匈币），如付不出罚款，就改处三个月徒刑。侵入匈牙利国境的美国军用机一架和飞机上所有物品一律没收。
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯二十九日讯引匈牙利通讯社消息：匈牙利政府已在二十八日将十一月十九日非法侵入匈牙利领空后被迫降落的美国军用飞机上的人员亨德逊等四人驱逐出境。匈牙利布达佩斯军事法庭二十三日判处亨德逊等人的罚款，已由美国驻匈公使馆缴纳。
