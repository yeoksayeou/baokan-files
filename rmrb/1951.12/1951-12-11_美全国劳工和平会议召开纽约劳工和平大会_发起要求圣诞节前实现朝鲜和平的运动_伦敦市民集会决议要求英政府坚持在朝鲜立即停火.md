Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: According to a telecommunications report from New York, the US National Labor Peace Conference convened the New York Labor Peace Assembly on the 1st. Four hundred representatives from various workshops and labor unions attended. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution deciding to launch a campaign to achieve peace in Korea before Christmas. The resolution stated: "We pledge to work tirelessly in our workshops during these days before December 27th (Note: The second item on the agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations was passed on November 27th, stipulating that if the military armistice agreement is signed within 30 days, the already determined military demarcation line will not be changed), uniting our comrades to jointly carry out the great task of ensuring lasting peace in Korea."

Nixon, a representative of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, pointed out in his opening speech that workers are unwilling to accept the sacrifices and decline in living standards caused by war plans. He criticized the narrow-minded thinking in labor unions that limits interest to union issues, pointing out that this is a major obstacle to the development of the peace movement. He emphasized that without peace, there can be no real improvement in the economic situation of workers. The peace issue is a matter of bread and butter, and it is also a labor union issue.

After Nixon's opening speech, representatives from dozens of workshops and labor unions reported on their plans for peace activities.

Richardson, chairman of the American Peace Crusade, explained the growing peace consciousness of the masses in many cities at the meeting. He announced that the Peace Crusade Committee is organizing a movement based on congressional districts to collect one million signatures for a declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. He also said that a conference of representatives will be held in Washington on January 30th next year, and the signature campaign will culminate at that time. The purpose of the conference is to express to Congress the will of voters demanding peace.

Friedman, chairman of the National Labor Peace Conference, announced that the citizens of New York will hold a rally in Union Square on the afternoon of December 11th, demanding a cessation of all fighting in Korea and demanding a permanent ceasefire before December 27th.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 9th: One thousand London citizens participated in a meeting held by the British-Chinese Friendship Association on the evening of the 3rd at Islington Town Hall. All attendees passed a resolution demanding that the British government insist on an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

Secretary Driffield of the British-Chinese Friendship Association briefly reported to the assembled masses on his recent trip to China to participate in the celebrations of the National Day of the People's Republic of China. He formally proposed that the conference pass a resolution welcoming the Korean armistice negotiations held in Panmunjom and demanding that the British government insist on an immediate ceasefire to avoid continued loss of life. All attendees unanimously passed this proposal in a thunderous chorus of "aye" votes. It will be sent to British Prime Minister Churchill and the United Nations respectively.

Before the meeting, the Chinese films "Daughters of China" and "Liberated China" were also shown. These two films were warmly welcomed by the audience.

    美全国劳工和平会议召开纽约劳工和平大会
    发起要求圣诞节前实现朝鲜和平的运动
    伦敦市民集会决议要求英政府坚持在朝鲜立即停火
    【新华社八日讯】据电通社纽约讯：美国全国劳工和平会议一日在纽约召开了纽约劳工和平大会，出席各车间和工会的代表四百人。大会一致通过决议，决定发起要求在圣诞节前在朝鲜实现和平的运动。决议说：“我们保证在十二月二十七日（按朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程是在十一月二十七日通过的，规定如果在三十日内军事停战协议签字，则已经确定的军事分界线将不再予以变更）以前这些日子里，在我们的车间进行不懈的工作，团结我们的同伴共同进行保证朝鲜获得永久和平的伟大工作。”
    联合电气、无线电与机器工会代表尼克森在致开会词时指出，工人们不愿接受战争计划所造成的牺牲和生活水准的下降。他批判了工会中一种把兴趣局限于工会问题的狭隘思想，指出这是发展和平运动的重大障碍，并强调说，没有和平，就不可能有工人经济情况的真正改善。和平问题就是面包和牛油的问题，也是工会的问题。
    在尼克森致开幕词后，有几十个车间和工会的代表报告了他们争取和平活动的计划。
    美国和平十字军委员会主席李查逊在会上说明许多城市中人民群众日益增长的和平意识。他宣布：和平十字军委员会正以国会选区为基础，组织为要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言征集一百万个签名的运动。他并说，明年一月三十日将在华盛顿召开代表大会，签名运动到那时将形成一个高潮；代表大会的目的是向国会表示选民要求和平的意志。
    全国劳工和平会议主席佛莱德曼宣布：纽约市民将在十二月十一日下午在联合广场举行集会，要求停止朝鲜境内的一切战斗，并要求在十二月二十七日以前实现永久停火。
    【新华社布拉格九日电】一千名伦敦市民参加了英中友好协会三日晚间在伊斯林顿市政厅举行的集会。全体到会者通过决议，要求英国政府坚持在朝鲜立即停火。
    英中友好协会秘书德里邦向到会群众简短地报告了他不久以前到中国参加中华人民共和国国庆节庆典的情形。他正式提议由大会通过决议，表示欢迎在板门店举行的朝鲜停战谈判，并要求英国政府坚持立即停火，以免继续牺牲生命。全体到会者在雷鸣般地高呼“赞成”声中一致通过了这个提议。它将被分别送交英国首相邱吉尔和联合国。
    会前还放映了中国影片“中华女儿”和“解放了的中国”。这两部影片受到观众热烈的欢迎。
