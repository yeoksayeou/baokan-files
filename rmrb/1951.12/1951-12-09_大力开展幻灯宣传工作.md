Slideshows are the predecessor of movies. In today's rapidly advancing film art, why should slideshow propaganda work still be emphasized? Because slideshows have many of their own characteristics and effects, even if they seem simpler than movies, they can and should be used as one of the important tools for propaganda and education. In 1950, slideshows in urban and rural areas of our country had a total audience of 80 million people. The broad masses of people warmly welcomed this more convenient slideshow that is "integrated with reality and uses local materials" than movies.

When electricity is not yet universally available in China's cities and villages, slideshows will continue to play their role. Even in the highly electrified Soviet Union, slideshow education work is still being promoted to this day, which shows that slideshows can be developed for a long time in China.

Slideshows have the following characteristics when applied to propaganda and education work: First, slideshow projectors are simple to manufacture, low in cost, and durable. They can be used in both areas with and without electricity. Second, the film production method is simple, can be done anytime, anywhere, and is the fastest to combine with central propaganda. It can give play to mass creativity, reflect the real people and events of the local area, and promptly promote the movement. It can also use local languages ​​to explain according to the audience's acceptance level, or plan to write "slideshow plays."

	An example of the masses making their own slideshows
	The slideshow projector in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, was researched and manufactured by a staff member of the Cultural Center and a folk artist. They were troubled for three months in search of a piece of glass for enlarging the picture.
	One day, they discovered an old gentleman using a burning glass to engrave characters. The shadow on the window was clearly projected onto the table through the burning glass. They thought that this material could be used. After several experiments, their slideshow was performed on New Year's Day in 1949.
	This primitive slideshow projector was made in this way: A hole was dug in a broken wooden box, and the burning glass was connected to a chopstick and inserted into half a piece of pumpkin peel. The pumpkin peel was moved when focusing the light. The condensing lens was a piece of convex glass from a train station hand lantern. Bricks were placed under the place for the film.
	After the screening, the masses said: "This thing is worth watching." This encouraged them. Later, they added a lens barrel and made a reflector out of tin foil from cigarette packs. The broken wooden box of the body smoked due to the high heat of the gas lamp. The masses sent cans to add iron sheets. In order to facilitate carrying, it was also modified into a foldable box. In 1950, they carried the slideshow projector all over the county, and the slideshow became a tool for propaganda, education, and entertainment mastered by the local farmers themselves.
	Under the leadership and promotion of the Shanxi Fine Arts Workers Association, slideshow work in Shanxi Province has been promoted throughout the province. Slideshow work has also been carried out in Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Baoding and other places in Hebei Province. From colored single-frame pictures, it has gradually progressed to "animated films." When screening, someone explains, and sometimes it is combined with folk arts, such as cross-talk, drum performance, quick talk, storytelling, and music, which further strengthens the effect of slideshow propaganda.

	Slideshow Propaganda Work in Rural Areas
	New China has completed land reform work in vast areas, and farmers have recovered their land and are stepping up production. In order to meet the needs of farmers, slideshows are a very powerful tool for agricultural propaganda and education work.
	In the spring of 1951, the Xiyang Cultural Center in Shanxi Province went to the countryside to promote production incentive methods and performed the "Spring Production Plan" slideshow, which played a great role in promoting spring plowing and sowing. In order to promote the specific methods of the three major construction policies in Shanxi, they produced the slideshow "Production and Construction," the content of which was combined with the county's agricultural activities at the time, and performed "Labor Model Wang Dianjun and Wang Anwu's Manure Accumulation and Wheat Planting Plan," "Zheng Guixuan's Wheat Seed Selection Method," and so on. Slideshows such as "Urban-Rural Mutual Assistance," "Cultural Education," and "Public Security Work" were also made based on local materials. The masses felt that they were cordial and easy to understand. At that time, a village cadre said: "I have been holding meetings for five or six days in a row, and tonight's slideshow clearly summarizes the meeting." An old man said: "After watching tonight's movie (slideshow), I feel that it is better than attending several folk schools."
	In order to promote the new marriage law, the Xiangyuan Cultural Center in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, drew a set of slideshows depicting the marriage problems of a certain person in the county. The farmers in the sixth district of the county said after watching it: "The buying and selling marriages in the old society were decided by parents, and I don't know how many people have been harmed. Like Dechang and Shuying from Wangcun freely married, now they have both cows and land, and the couple is doing great." After the screening of "Seed Dressing with Medicine" in Qiaoshang Village, the first district of Wanquan County, Shanxi, the masses such as Li Fengchun immediately asked to buy Ceresan (pesticide) to prepare for seed dressing.
	The Jingxing County Cultural Center showed slideshows at the Naxi Jiao Temple Fair in August 1950, with an audience of more than 30,000 people, some of whom came from more than 20 miles away. When screening in Luoyang Village, because it rained for three or four days, the audience stood in the muddy ground and insisted on watching it.
	Last winter, the Shijiazhuang Cultural Center first went to the villages in the suburbs to collect materials for sideline production, made them into slideshows, and then went to the area to show them, which increased the labor enthusiasm of the masses.
	Other rural slideshow work in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, Zhejiang, Hunan, and southwestern regions has also achieved certain results.

	Slideshow Propaganda Work in Factories and Mines
	The Shijiazhuang Cultural Center first promoted slideshow work in factories, and received a good response from the workers. Because they made specific and vivid materials from Shijiazhuang factories, such as model deeds and inventions, into lantern slides and screened them in a timely manner, they stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for hard work.
	The "Not a Cicada" script written by Wei Lianzhen, a worker at the Shijiazhuang Inspection Section, was also made into a slideshow. When it was screened in the Inspection Section, everyone was in high spirits and shouted the slogan "Step up production and complete the task" in unison.
	In 1950, an incident occurred at the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan where a British man insulted workers. On the evening of the incident, the slideshow workers used slideshows to express the crimes of the British man, educating the workers in various factories and enabling them to take active action to support the insulted comrades.
	The Tangshan Cultural Center not only regularly sent slideshows to various factories, but also sent them to underground mines to screen slideshows on mine safety and accident prevention. The Tangshan Cultural Center produced many slideshows with high artistic and technical level of painting, meticulous and realistic.
	In addition to showing slideshows in the mine's headquarters cinema while showing movies, the Culture and Education Department of the Trade Union of the Xi'an Mining Area in Liaodong Province also went to various mine clubs for touring screenings, so that the mine's employees could understand the content of the slideshows and carry out propaganda in coordination with current affairs and the current central task of the coal mine.
	Since last December, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has established a slideshow production organization in the Cultural Palace to promote slideshow work to various factories.

	Slideshow Propaganda Work in the Military
	Slideshow work has been going on in our People's Army for a long time, and the soldiers especially like it.
	In the Huaihai Campaign, in order to make the slideshow easier to carry, the slideshow team only brought a lens and two condensing lenses, and when they arrived at a place, they found a shoebox or something and set it up for performance. The light sources included generators, car lights, gas lamps, and flashlights.
	Some of the lantern slides were drawn by the soldiers themselves. There were many people, many slides, many patterns, and full of fun. Whenever they arrived in an area, they often used slideshows to introduce local customs, human feelings, and geography to the soldiers.
	Slideshows not only moved around in small-caliber artillery positions, but also entered trenches and bunkers. When a soldier made meritorious service, his deeds were immediately drawn into a slideshow and shown to other companies.
	The current methods of making slideshows in the army are engraving and drawing in parallel with photography. The slideshow team of a certain field army's political department specializes in making slideshows and screening them in directly subordinate units. Other armies also have slideshow teams, and each division, regiment, battalion, and company also have slideshow activities.

	Slideshow Propaganda Work in Cities
	Around July 1st, slideshow workers in Beijing held a "Beijing Anti-US and Aid Korea Slideshow Propaganda Week," and the audience in one week reached more than 100,000 people. In Changsha, to commemorate "May 1st," more than 100 slideshow teams were organized to screen simultaneously, and the audience was also counted at more than 100,000 people.
	Tangshan has four or five movie theaters of various sizes. Because it is a densely populated industrial city in North China and close to the railway, many new movies are shown, and the number of moviegoers is also very large. However, the slideshow propaganda activities of the Tangshan People's Cultural Center are still doing well, and it is the slideshow work that has gradually made the masses aware of the work of the Cultural Center. This is mainly because slideshows can quickly reflect central work and current affairs issues. The Cultural Center often strives to compile important news and editorials from newspapers into slideshows for screening on the same day. In addition, the Cultural Center also used slideshows to cooperate with the work of various departments such as the local miners' union, the New Democratic Youth League organization, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organization, and the municipal government. At first, they went outside to collect materials, but later others sent materials to the Cultural Center.
	The Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau has an audio-visual education counseling office. At first, lantern slides were drawn based on current affairs cartoons in newspapers, and slideshows were shown on the streets of bustling areas, workers' areas, and residential areas. Later, they drew a set of story-based lantern slides, and broadcast records before and after the screening, so the audience increased greatly. In order to achieve the goal of "delivering slideshow propaganda to the door," they created an "audio-visual education work vehicle." The screen was hung in front of the car, and both sides could see clearly when screening. The car was equipped with a loudspeaker and records, and the roof was a platform, which was convenient for the slideshow screening personnel and commentators to work on. Other small performances could also be performed, and the surrounding area was covered with cloth to display pictures. The screening vehicle was surrounded by the audience wherever it went.
	The content of the slideshow compilation and drawing is divided into four types: political education, cooperation with the central task of propaganda in each period, current affairs news, science and hygiene, etc. When Nanjing promoted household registration, the slideshows screened in each district were drawn with real people and events after learning about the problems in the household registration in the district in advance, and then taken to the district for screening, which was very effective.

	A Few Hopes
	First, slideshows should exert their greater power in assisting school education work, and we should plan to produce new teaching material slideshows. In ethnic minority areas in China, slideshow propaganda work should also be carried out rapidly, because it is more effective than general written propaganda and is not restricted by language barriers.
	If factories and mines across the country can all carry out slideshow work, in addition to carrying out general propaganda and education work, it can also be used to exchange experiences and improve technology. For example, the Hao Jianxiu work method can be filmed into a slideshow and quickly sent to textile factories across the country for screening, which will be of great help in promoting this progressive work method.
	Second, publishers of serial picture books across the country can make each page size suitable for slideshows, so that slideshow workers can draw them into lantern slides.
	Each film studio can also compile good films into slideshows and send them to places that cannot be reached by film screening teams (the Soviet Union did this). It is also hoped that a slideshow production factory will appear to plan and control the promotion of slideshow work and the production of various types of slideshows. (Editor's note: The Audio-Visual Education Tool Manufacturing Institute of the Central Ministry of Culture's Science Popularization Bureau specializes in manufacturing slideshow projectors and lantern slides, and has distributed more than 100 kinds of lantern slides, and has contact with slideshow screening institutions in various provinces, cities, and counties across the country.)

    大力开展幻灯宣传工作
    顾华
    幻灯是电影的前身。在电影艺术突飞猛进的今天，为什么幻灯宣传工作还应该加以重视呢？因为幻灯有它自己的很多特点和功效，即使比起电影来显得简陋一些，但还是可以而且也应该被用作重要的宣传教育的工具之一。在一九五○年，我国城乡幻灯的观众共有八千万人，广大的人民群众热烈欢迎这个比电影更为轻便的、“结合实际、就地取材”的幻灯。
    当电力在我国的城市和乡村中还不能普遍使用的时候，幻灯将继续发挥它的功效。即使在高度电气化的苏联，直到现在，也还在推行幻灯教育工作，可见幻灯在中国将可以长期地发展下去的。
    幻灯应用在宣传教育工作上有下列几个特点：一、幻灯机制作简单，成本低廉，机件耐用。无论在有电无电地区，均能使用。二、制片方法简单，随时随地可作，结合中心宣传最快，能发挥群众创造性，反映当地真人真事，及时起推进运动的作用。还可按观众接受程度，利用当地语言讲解，或有计划地编写“幻灯剧”。群众自己制造幻灯的一个例子
    山西昔阳县的幻灯机是由文化馆的一位工作同志和一位民间艺人研究、制造的。他们为了寻觅一块放大画面用的玻璃，曾经为难了三个月。
    有一天，他们发现了一位拿着火镜在刻字的老先生，窗上的影子通过火镜射在桌子上，看得很清楚。他们就想到可以利用这个材料。经过几次的试验，他们的幻灯在一九四九年元旦演出了。
    这架原始的幻灯机是这样制造的：把一个破木箱挖了一个窟窿，把火镜接上一根筷子，插在半块南瓜皮上。对光的时候，将瓜皮移动。聚光镜是火车站手提灯上的一块凸玻璃。放片子的地方垫了砖头。
    放映后，群众说：“这个东西有看头。”这话鼓舞了他们。后来，他们又加上镜头筒，用包香烟的锡纸作成反光镜，机身的破木箱因受汽灯高热烤焦而冒烟，群众送了罐头盒子来，才加上了铁皮。为了便于携带，又改制成能折的箱子。一九五○年他们携带幻灯机，走遍全县，于是幻灯成了当地农民自己掌握的宣传教育和娱乐的工具。
    山西省的幻灯工作在山西美术工作者协会领导和推动下，已经推广到全省。河北省的石家庄、唐山、保定等地也已经有计划地开展幻灯工作。从有色的单幅画面，逐渐进步到“活动片”。放映时有人解说，有时还配合上民间曲艺，如相声、大鼓、快板、评词和音乐等，更是加强了幻灯宣传的效果。幻灯宣传工作在农村
    新中国在广大地区完成了土地改革工作，农民收回了自己的土地，加紧生产。为了满足农民的要求，幻灯是进行农业宣传教育工作的一个极有力的工具。
    山西昔阳文化馆在一九五一年春天下乡宣传奖励生产的办法，演出配合当地中心工作的“春季生产计划”幻灯片，对春耕下种起了很大的推动作用。为了宣传山西三大建设方针的具体作法，他们制作了幻灯片“生产建设”，内容结合了该县当时的农事活动，演出“劳动模范王殿俊王安五的积肥种麦计划”、“郑规选的小麦选种办法”等等。“城乡互助”、“文化教育”、“治安工作”等等的幻灯片，也都是根据当地材料制作的。群众都感到亲切易懂。当时有一位村干部说：“我一连开了五、六天会，今晚上的幻灯就明明确确地把会议总结啦。”一位老乡说：“我看了今晚上的电影（幻灯），觉得比上几回民校还强呢。”
    山西省长治专区襄垣文化馆为了宣传新婚姻法，画了一套描写该县某人婚姻问题的幻灯片。该县六区的农民看了说：“旧社会的买卖婚姻由父母做主，不知害了多少人，像人家王村的德昌和淑英自由结婚，如今又添牛、又添地，两口子过得怪美的。”在山西万泉县一区桥上村放映“药剂拌种”后，就有群众李丰春等立即要求买赛力散（农药），准备拌种。
    井陉县文化馆一九五○年八月在南西焦庙会上放映幻灯，观众达三万多人，有从二十里地以外赶来的。在洛阳村放映时，因为下了三四天雨，观众站在泥泞地里坚持看完。
    石家庄文化馆在去年冬季先到郊区各村收集副业生产的材料，制成幻灯片，又到该地放映，提高了群众的劳动热情。
    其他如皖北、苏北、河北、浙江、湖南、以及西南等地的农村幻灯工作，也都收到一定的效果。
    幻灯宣传工作在工厂和矿山
    石家庄文化馆首先在工厂中推进幻灯工作，得到了工人们良好的反应。因为他们把石家庄各工厂具体生动的材料，如模范事迹、发明创造等制成灯片，及时放映，激发了工人努力生产的热情。
    石家庄检车段工人魏连珍编写的“不是蝉”剧本，也摄成了幻灯片。在检车段放映时，大家情绪高涨，一致喊出了“加紧生产，完成任务”的口号。
    一九五○年唐山开滦煤矿发生英国人污辱工人事件。事件发生的当晚，幻灯工作同志就把那个英国人的罪行用幻灯片表现出来，教育了各厂工人，使他们积极地采取行动，支援受辱同志。
    唐山文化馆不但把幻灯经常送到各工厂里去，而且还送入地下的矿场里，放映矿场保安、防止事故等幻灯片。唐山文化馆制出的幻灯片很多，并且绘画技术水平较高，精细而真实。
    辽东省西安矿区工会文教部除了在矿区本部电影院与放映电影同时放映幻灯外，还到各矿俱乐部去巡回放映，使矿区职工都能在领会幻灯片内容之后，配合着时事和煤矿当前的中心任务进行宣传。
    上海总工会由去年十二月开始，在文化宫内设立了幻灯制片机构，向各工厂推动幻灯工作。
    幻灯宣传工作在部队
    幻灯工作在我们人民军队中，已经进行很久了，战士们特别喜欢。
    在淮海战役中，为了使幻灯更便于携带，幻灯组只带上一个镜头和两片聚光镜，到了一个地方找到个鞋盒子什么的装置上就演出。光源有发电机、汽车灯、汽灯、手电筒等。
    灯片的绘制，有的是出于战士们自己之手。人多，片子多，花样也多，趣味横生。每到一个地区，也常常把当地的风俗、人情、地理等通过幻灯来向战士们介绍。
    幻灯不只在小口径炮阵地里活动，而且进入了战壕和碉堡。某某战士立了功，他的事迹马上就被绘成幻灯片，到其他连队里放映。
    幻灯片在军队中的制作方法，目前是刻绘与摄影并进。某野战军政治部电影队的幻灯组，专门摄制幻灯片，在直属各单位放映。其他各军也设有幻灯组，各师、团、营、连也都有幻灯活动。
    幻灯宣传工作在都市
    北京市幻灯工作者在“七一”左右曾举行了一次“北京市抗美援朝幻灯宣传周”，一个星期中的观众达十余万人；长沙市为纪念“五一”，组织了百余个幻灯队同时放映，统计观众也达十余万人。
    唐山有大小四、五个电影院。因为它是华北一个人口众多的工业都市，又靠近铁路，放映新的电影片子很多，电影观众的数目也很大；但唐山人民文化馆的幻灯宣传活动仍然搞得很好，就是靠幻灯工作使群众对文化馆的工作渐渐地有了认识。这主要因为幻灯片能够迅速反映中心工作和时事问题。文化馆常常把报纸上的重要新闻和社论，争取当天编制成幻灯片来放映。此外，文化馆还用幻灯配合了当地矿工工会、新民主主义青年团组织、中苏友好协会组织、市政府等各部门的工作。最初他们是到外边去收集材料，后来却是别人给文化馆送材料来了。
    南京市教育局设有电化教育辅导处。最初是根据报纸上的时事漫画描绘灯片，在闹市、工人区、住宅区的街头放映幻灯。后来就绘制成套的，有故事性的灯片了，并于放映前后播送唱片，因此观众大增。他们为达到“把幻灯宣传送上门”的目的，创造了一部“电教工作车”。把银幕挂在车前，放映时两面都可看得清楚。车内装扩音机和唱片，车顶是一平台，幻灯的放映人员和解说人员在上面工作很便利，也可以做其他小的表演，四周加上布围子可展览图片。放映车每到一处就被观众包围起来。
    在幻灯片编绘内容上，分为四种：进行政治教育的、配合每一时期宣传中心任务的、时事消息、科学与卫生等。当南京市宣传户口登记的时候，各区所放映的幻灯片，都是事先把该区户口中的问题了解后，真人真事地绘制出来，再拿到该区去放映，收效很大。
        几点希望
    一、幻灯在辅助学校教育工作上应该发挥它的更大的力量，我们应该有计划地制作新教材幻灯片。在国内少数民族地区，也要迅速开展幻灯宣传工作，因为它比一般文字宣传来得更有效，不受语言隔阂的限制。
    全国各地工厂、矿山，若是都能把幻灯工作搞起来，除了进行一般宣教工作外，还可以用它来交流经验、改进技术。例如可以把郝建秀工作法拍制成幻灯片，迅速送到全国各纺织厂去放映，这对推广这一进步的工作法，是会有极大帮助的。
    二、全国各地连环图画的出版者，可以把每幅版面制成适合于幻灯片的尺寸，以便于幻灯工作者描绘成灯片。
    各电影制片厂也可以把好片子编成幻灯片，送到电影放映队达不到的地方去（苏联就是这样作的）。更希望能有幻灯制片厂出现，把幻灯工作的推行和各类幻灯片的制作，有计划地掌握起来。（编者按：中央文化部科学普及局有一个电化教育工具制造所，专门制造幻灯及幻灯片，已发行一百多种幻灯片，和全国各省、市、县的幻灯放映机构有联系。）（附图片）
