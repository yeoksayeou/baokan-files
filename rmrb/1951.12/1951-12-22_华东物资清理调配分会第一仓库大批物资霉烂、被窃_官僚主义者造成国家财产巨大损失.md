    Large Quantities of Materials Rot and are Stolen from the First Warehouse of the East China Materials Clearing and Transfer Branch: Bureaucrats Cause Huge Losses of State Property
    Editor's Note: The incident of large quantities of materials rotting and being stolen from the First Warehouse of the East China Materials Clearing and Transfer Branch illustrates that the bureaucratic work style of leading organs is the fundamental reason for the damage and theft of state property. This incident should be thoroughly investigated by the responsible departments. Not only should waste be examined, but also corruption. Serious bureaucratic elements should also be strictly dealt with.
    Leading cadres of the First Warehouse, under the East China Branch of the National Materials Clearing and Transfer Committee, have serious bureaucratic tendencies, resulting in the rotting and theft of stored materials and extremely huge losses of state property. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Supervisory Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee have attached great importance to this matter. They organized forces to actively carry out rescue work at the end of October and have now salvaged more than six thousand tons of open-air materials. Currently, they are continuing to selectively inventory and salvage the materials in the warehouse.
    The most significant loss suffered by the First Warehouse is the rotting of large quantities of open-air materials. According to a preliminary investigation of five important materials in this warehouse by the inspection team led by the East China Bureau and the People's Supervisory Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee, and the East China Branch of the National Materials Clearing and Transfer Committee, the losses from rotting alone exceeded 11 billion yuan. Among them, the loss of automobile tires alone was 2,500, with a loss value of more than 5 billion yuan. In the sixth sub-warehouse of this warehouse, there were 750 tires that were more than 70% new, which had been immersed in mud for two years and are now mostly scrapped. There are also a larger number of other important materials and general materials with rot losses that are currently difficult to count. At the same time, there are approximately 1,800 tons of materials in this warehouse that have not been accounted for, including more than 1,100 boxes of various machines (including a large number of textile machines, generators, and machine tools) and a large number of communication equipment, transportation equipment, and daily necessities. Because these materials have not been accounted for, it is impossible to calculate the extent of rot and theft, and it also affects the planned allocation of national needs. For example, some departments have been ordered several times to transfer needed materials from here, but could not find them because there were no accounts to check. In addition, losses from the theft and illegal use of materials are also very serious. According to the First Warehouse's incomplete statistics, there have been as many as 392 instances of illegal use of materials, creating another huge loophole in the warehouse's material losses.
    The historical factors that caused such huge losses are the corruption and incompetence of the Kuomintang bandits' management before liberation, the chaotic state of materials in the warehouse, some without accounts, some with discrepancies between accounts and materials, and a large number of important materials placed outdoors, leaving considerable difficulties for material management after liberation; however, the main and direct reason is that the leading cadres of the First Warehouse and its higher authorities have extremely serious bureaucratic tendencies and are very lax and negligent in the management of warehouse materials.
    The former director of this warehouse, Ren Ping (Communist Party member, transferred two months ago), is a typical bureaucrat who is well-fed and does nothing. He does not rely on the organization in his work and has repeatedly refused to accept the opinions put forward to him by the Party branch committee, and he lacks the idea of relying on the working class. Although the workers have put forward many rationalization proposals to him, such as the workers at the first sub-warehouse raising the issue at each district affairs meeting that "a large number of automobile tires are immersed in water and need to be rescued," and the workers at the fifth sub-warehouse repeatedly reflecting that "open-air materials are affected by rain and tide and need to be dealt with quickly," he turned a deaf ear and ignored them. On the other hand, he himself is not responsible. For a long period before August of this year, Ren Ping often arrived at the office after 10:00 AM, but did not work. Instead, he lay on the sofa and read the newspaper (sometimes he didn't come at all), and slept for the entire afternoon, getting up at 4:00 or 5:00 PM to eat dinner. Because of this, almost all kinds of important incoming and outgoing documents from January to August were pushed to Deputy Director Cha Jizha to handle; Cha Jizha was a person with a strong old-fashioned style who "coped with superiors, tried to please and maintain harmony with subordinates, and took a perfunctory attitude towards work," and concealed problems in the warehouse without reporting them. Even more serious is that Ren Ping did not control the "correction reports." As needed, the leadership should carefully examine and grasp such reports from below that "things are missing, corrections are needed"; however, Ren Ping did not even look at them, and gave his seal to the material accounting section chief, who then transferred it to the clerk for stamping, resulting in numerous malpractices. Thus, there was even less talk of ideological leadership of the masses. The workers had asked Ren Ping to give a report several times, but he emphasized that "his health was not good, and if he gave a report once, he would have to sleep (sick) for several days" and refused. However, according to the masses, "Director Ren raised six chickens and three sheep, and he spent a lot of time talking to people about raising chickens and sheep." Because leading cadres have this kind of bureaucratic work style, the work efficiency of staff is very poor, and even individual staff members are passively resisting work; the phenomena of consciously concealing materials and stealing occur constantly.
    Ren Ping's bureaucratic work style of being well-fed and doing nothing was produced under the development of his hedonistic and corrupt ideas. After he went south to Shanghai to work, his performance in the first two months was good. Later, he was gradually tempted by bourgeois life, constantly demanded better treatment, and developed hedonistic and corrupt ideas. For example, last year, in order to drive a car, he asked workers to dismantle parts from a complete generator to repair a jeep; after it was repaired, he often drove it around for fun even when there was nothing to do, and wasted barrels of unaccounted-for gasoline. The higher authorities stipulated that vehicles should be registered, but he concealed it for a time without reporting. After the car was recovered, he asked the workers to repair two pedal-powered machines for him, and exchanged a 12-horsepower American Jemo-style locomotive for a 3.5-horsepower small Pao-brand car from a private merchant. Worker Ding Desheng of the heavy machinery team said, "Director Ren regards his own enjoyment as very important and regards public materials as very unimportant." Because Ren Ping valued personal enjoyment and despised state property in this way, he gradually abandoned his leadership of warehouse work.
    From the incident of serious losses suffered by the First Warehouse, it is reflected that the leading cadres of the East China Branch of the National Materials Clearing and Transfer Committee also have bureaucratic work styles. The responsible comrades of the East China Branch used to be high above, not going deep into the lower levels, and only took a cursory look when they occasionally came to the warehouse. Some workers called them "rare guests," meaning that they rarely came to the warehouse. They usually just "process documents" and "hold meetings." According to several warehouse directors, past administrative meetings rarely solved problems; and individual responsible comrades of the warehouse did not even want to participate in such meetings, fearing wasting time. In processing documents, there is a tendency towards red tape. For example, on April 19th of this year, the First Warehouse reported to the warehouse management department of the East China Branch that "many machine parts have recently been transferred from external warehouses, but because the transfer slips do not specify detailed specifications, a large number of backlogged unreported daily reports have accumulated, and we request that technical personnel be dispatched to the warehouse to ascertain the specifications so that they can be filled out." Such an important document went through twenty approval procedures within the warehouse management department, circulated on the department's desk for a full half year, and was not returned to the First Warehouse until October 19th, and the problem was still not specifically resolved. According to comrades at the First Warehouse, there are many similar documents that are reported but delayed in reply or even have no outcome. This fully exposes the seriousness of the bureaucracy in the leadership of the branch. What is especially intolerable is that when the leadership of the East China Branch discovered that the materials had begun to rot, they neither studied and came up with a clear treatment plan nor helped the warehouse solve the problem, showing a lack of responsible spirit towards the people's property. The workers in the warehouse repeatedly reflected on the open-air materials, "those covered with tarpaulins are also leaking, and those without tarpaulins are suffering even greater losses," and proposed "building a bamboo shed or a warehouse to avoid losses several times or even dozens of times the construction cost." However, because the leading cadres of the branch lacked the idea of relying on the working class, they never took the initiative to actively think of ways to solve the problem, and often unilaterally emphasized difficulties, so that many rationalization proposals were discarded on the ground like open-air materials. In the minds of some responsible persons in the branch, they also believed that "some materials are always going to be lost." In late August of this year, Zheng Zizheng, director of the general office of the East China Branch, inspected the warehouse after receiving a report on the serious material losses of the First Warehouse. However, when he saw the white coir ropes that had rotted from rain, he did not think it was rot; and said: "Coir ropes are not afraid of water, and people without scientific knowledge will be alarmed." In fact, 290,000 catties of coir ropes had rotted. When he saw the damaged fire hoses, he also said: "What is this! There are many more in the fourth warehouse." Once, when Zheng Zizheng arrived at the First Warehouse, comrades from the general office and the second sub-warehouse reported to him in person that many canned foods had begun to rot and asked him what to do. His instruction was "eat what can be eaten, bury what cannot be eaten." This shows that in his mind, he did not regard these materials as the property of the people's country.
    In addition, the Shanghai New Urban District Committee of the Communist Party of China did not grasp the leadership of the First Warehouse branch, which is also one of the reasons for the huge losses.

    华东物资清理调配分会第一仓库大批物资霉烂、被窃
    官僚主义者造成国家财产巨大损失
    编者按：华东物资清理调配分会第一仓库大批物资霉烂、被窃的事件，说明了领导机关的官僚主义作风，是使国家财产遭受损害和被盗窃的根本原因。这一事件应由主管部门彻底究查。不但要检查浪费现象，还要注意检查贪污现象。对于严重的官僚主义分子同样应当给以严格的处理。
    全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会所属第一仓库领导干部有严重的官僚主义，致存仓物资霉烂、被盗窃，国家财产遭受了极其巨大的损失。中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会、华东军政委员会人民监察委员会对这件事情已经予以高度的重视，并于十月底开始，组织力量积极进行抢救，现已抢救了六千吨以上的露天物资。目前，正继续对库内物资有重点地进行清点和抢救。
    第一仓库所遭受的损失，最主要的是大批露天物资霉烂。根据华东局和华东军政委员会人民监察委员会领导的检查组和全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会对这个仓库五种重要物资的初步调查，仅霉烂损失就超过了一百一十亿元。其中汽车轮胎一项的霉烂损失就有二千五百只，损失价值在五十亿元以上。在这个仓库的第六分库原有七百五十只七成以上新的轮胎，两年来一直浸在泥水里，现已大部报废。还有为数更多的其他重要物资和一般物资的霉烂损失，目前尚难统计。同时，这个仓库还有大约一千八百多吨的物资一直没有报账，其中有各种机器一千一百多箱（包括大批的纺织机、发电机和工作母机等）及大批的通讯器材、交通器材和日用品等。由于这些物资没有报账，不仅无法统计霉烂和被盗窃的情况，而且影响了国家需要上的有计划调拨。如有些部门曾经奉令数度到这里调动所需物资，因为无账可查而没有找到。另外，物资被偷盗与被非法动用所遭受的损失也很严重。据第一仓库尚不完整的统计，目前已发现的非法动用物资的事，就有三百九十二次之多，造成这个仓库物资损失的另一个巨大漏洞。
    造成这样巨大损失的历史因素，是解放前国民党匪帮管理的腐败无能，库内物资混乱不堪，有的没账，有的账料不符，更有大批的重要物资露天放在外面，给解放后的物资管理留下了不小的困难；但是，主要的、直接的原因，则是由于第一仓库及其上级机关的领导干部有极其严重的官僚主义，对仓库物资的管理十分松懈和麻痹。
    这个仓库前任主任任平（共产党员，已调职两月）是一个饱食终日无所用心的典型的官僚主义者。他在工作中不依靠组织，曾经多次拒不接受党的支部委员会向他提的意见，更缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想。工人虽曾向他提出很多合理化建议，例如一分库每次区务会议上，工人都提出“大批的汽车轮胎浸在水里要抢救”，五分库工人几次反映“露天物资受雨潮要赶快处理”，他都充耳不闻，概不理睬。另一方面，他自己又毫不负责。在今年八月以前的很长时期内，任平经常在上午十点钟过后到办公室，但并不办公，而是在沙发上一躺，看看报纸（有时根本就不来），下午睡整个半天，到四、五点多钟起来吃晚饭。正因为如此，今年一至八月的各种重要往来文件，几乎全是推给副主任查济槎处理；而查济槎又是“对上应付应付，对下拉拢、一团和气，对工作采取敷衍态度”的带有浓重的旧作风的人，仓库内出了毛病也隐瞒不报。更严重的是任平对“更正报告”也不掌握。按需要说，这种来自下面的“东西少了、要更正”的报告，领导方面更应仔细审查掌握；然而任平却连看也不看，并把自己的图章交给料账股长，而料账股长又转交给办事员代盖，以致弊端百出。这样就更谈不上对群众的思想领导了。工人们曾经好几次要求任平作报告，他都是强调“身体不好，要是作一次报告，起码要睡（病）上好几天”而加以拒绝。但是，据群众反映：“任主任喂了六只鸡、三头羊，他和人家谈喂鸡喂羊等问题，化费的时间倒不少。”因为领导干部有这种官僚主义作风，所以工作人员工作效率很差，甚至个别人员消极怠工；有意识地匿报物资和偷盗的现象，因此也不断地发生。
    任平这种饱食终日无所用心的官僚主义作风，是在他的享乐腐化思想发展之下产生的。他南下到上海任职后，头两个月工作表现还好。以后，就逐渐受资产阶级生活引诱，经常闹待遇，滋长着享乐腐化思想。譬如他去年为了想坐汽车，竟要工人在一部完整的发电机上把零件拆下来，用来修理一部吉普车；修好后，没有事情也经常在外面开着玩，未报账的汽油被他一桶桶拿去浪费掉。上级规定车辆要登记，他一度隐瞒不报。汽车被收回后，他又要工人替他修好两部机器脚踏车，并把一辆十二匹马力的美制捷莫式机车向私商换来一辆三匹半马力的小炮牌车。重机组工人丁德盛说：“任主任把自己享受看得十分重要，把公家物资看得很轻微。”任平就因为这样看重个人享受，轻视国家财产，逐渐放弃对仓库工作的领导。
    从第一仓库遭受严重损失这一事件中，反映出全国物资清理调配委员会华东分会的领导干部，也有官僚主义作风。华东分会的负责同志过去都是高高在上，不深入下层，偶然下库来也只是走马看花。有些工人群众叫他们为“大稀客”，意思是说他们难得下库来。他们平时只是“处理处理公文”，
    “开开会”。根据好几个仓库主任反映，过去的行政会议都是很少解决问题的；还有个别仓库的负责同志甚至不想参加这种会议，怕浪费时间。在处理公文上，又有文牍主义的偏向。如今年四月十九日，第一仓库曾向华东分会仓管处报告“新近自外库移来许多机件，因移仓单上未注明详细规格，致积压未报的日报表颇多，拟请迅派技术人员来库查明规格，以便填报”。这样一件重要公文，在仓管处内经过了二十道批阅手续，在该处办公桌上足足地周转了半年，到十月十九日才回文给第一仓库，问题还是没有具体解决。据第一仓库同志反映，类似这种公文，报上去拖延不复甚至没有下文的还有不少。这充分地暴露了分会领导方面官僚主义的严重程度。尤其不能容忍的，是华东分会领导方面在发现物资开始霉烂的时候，既没有去研究出明确的处理方针，又不帮助仓库解决问题，表现出对人民财产缺乏负责的精神。仓库的工人对于露天物资，一再地反映“有雨布盖的也漏水，没有雨布的损失更大”，并且提出“搭一个竹棚也好，建一幢库房也好，可以避免数倍甚至数十倍于建筑费的损失”。但由于分会领导干部缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想，始终没有主动地积极想办法解决问题，经常是片面强调困难，使很多合理化建议都像露天物资一样，被弃之于地。在分会某些负责人的思想上，也认为“物资总是要损失一些的”。今年八月下旬，华东分会办公厅主任郑子争在接到第一仓库物资损失严重的报告后，曾到库视察。但是，当他看到受雨霉烂的白棕绳时，竟认为这不算霉烂；并且说：
    “棕绳是不怕水的，没有科学知识的人就会大惊小怪。”事实上，有二十九万斤棕绳都霉烂了。当他看到损失的水龙带时，也说：“这算得什么！在四库多的是。”有一次，郑子争到了第一仓库，总办公室和二分库的同志当面报告说有很多的罐头开始烂了，问他怎么办。他的指示是“可以吃的吃掉，不能吃的埋掉。”这说明在他的思想上，也没有把这些物资看作是人民国家的财产。
    此外，中共上海市新市区委员会没有抓紧对第一仓库支部的领导，也是造成巨大损失的原因之一。
