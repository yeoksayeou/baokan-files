    Taiyuan Steel Plant Leaders Should Care About Workers' Welfare

    To the Editor: After reading the article "A Striking Example of Neglecting Workers' Lives" written by Wang Guiying of Taiyuan Steel Plant, published on the second page of the People's Daily on December 14th, we immediately thought of other instances where Taiyuan Steel Plant leaders disregarded workers' welfare. We interned at the Taiyuan Steel Plant twice, last year and this year. During our internships, we saw that the toilet problem in the factory had reached a serious level (as reported in the newspaper), and we also saw the unreasonable situation in the canteen and bathhouse. Every time we entered the canteen, we saw flies flying all over the place. Workers said, "If you scoop into the rice soup, you get a spoonful of flies." The canteen management system was also very poor. Sometimes workers handed in their meal tickets, but the management staff simply refused to acknowledge them. No one managed the workers' bathhouse either, making the pool water smelly and extremely dirty. In the evening, there were no lights in the bathhouse. In fact, this factory is fully capable of improving workers' welfare. We raised our concerns with the factory leaders, but they emphasized objective difficulties and superficially accepted some issues, but did not actually improve them. We believe that the leaders of Taiyuan Steel Plant should deeply examine their serious bureaucratic work style.

    太原钢铁厂领导干部应该关心工人福利
    编辑同志：我们看到十二月十四日人民日报第二版登载的太原钢铁厂王贵英写的“不关心工人生活的一个显著的例子”一文后，立刻联想到太原钢铁厂领导干部漠视工人福利的其他事实。我们在去年和今年，曾两度到太原钢铁厂去实习。在实习期中，我们看到了厂里的厕所问题已达到严重程度（如报上所载），也看到了食堂和澡塘方面的不合理情况。我们每一次进食堂，就只见苍蝇满堂飞，工人说：“往米汤中一捞，就是一杓子苍蝇。”食堂管理制度也很差，工人有时交了饭票，而管理人员却偏不承认。工人澡塘也没人管，弄得池水发臭，肮脏异常，到了晚上，澡塘里也没有电灯。其实，这个厂是完全有条件把工人福利搞好的。我们曾向这个厂的领导干部提过意见，但他们强调客观困难，对某些问题表面表示接受，实际却不改进。我们认为太原钢铁厂领导干部应深刻检查严重的官僚主义作风。
