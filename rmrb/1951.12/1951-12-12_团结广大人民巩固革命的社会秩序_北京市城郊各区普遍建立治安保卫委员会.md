    Unite the Broad Masses of the People to Consolidate the Revolutionary Social Order
    Security Committees Universally Established in Beijing's Urban and Suburban Districts
   [Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch] People's security organizations of a mass character - Security Committees - have been universally established in Beijing's urban and suburban districts.

    The work of establishing Security Committees in Beijing was carried out on the basis of the victory in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement and the general improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people. Since Peng Zhen, the Mayor of Beijing, put forward the call to establish Security Committees in May this year, people from all walks of life have warmly supported it and demanded its rapid establishment. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau accepted the demands of the broad masses of the people, and first selected one or two streets in each public security sub-bureau to carry out typical experiments in establishing Security Committees. After gaining preliminary experience in establishing street Security Committees, each district comprehensively launched this work in October. Before establishing Security Committees, most streets and suburban rural areas carried out sufficient preparatory work. Each public security station universally organized preparatory committees including activists from all aspects of the masses to carry out publicity, elections and other work.

    Before the election and establishment of the Security Committees, the preparatory committee mobilized members of grass-roots organizations of various mass organizations and industrial and commercial trade associations, organized propaganda teams or propaganda groups, and conducted in-depth publicity to the citizens through mass meetings, entertainment evenings, seminars, reading groups, night schools, blackboard newspapers, or individual visits, so that the broad masses of citizens understood the significance of establishing Security Committees.

    Street and rural Security Committees in Beijing's urban and suburban districts were all produced through democratic elections. The election of the Security Committees was carried out by the local people directly proposing a list of candidates, carefully discussing them, and then conducting elections. The members of the Security Committees directly elected by the citizens include people from all walks of life, with workers, farmers and housewives being the most numerous. Most of them are activists in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement, and the Land Reform Movement in the suburbs. After being elected, their work enthusiasm and initiative were further improved. For example, in the security work during this year's National Day, many members of the Security Committees participated in the security work day and night. An old lady in her fifties insisted on working for two nights despite the dissuasion of the police station. She said, "This is the task given to us by Chairman Mao. I was elected by the masses. What does it matter if I don't sleep for two nights?"

    After the establishment of the street and rural Security Committees, they all formulated security pacts and wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Peng Zhen, the Mayor of Beijing, promising to assist the People's Government in doing a good job in the capital's security work. The Security Committees established earlier have already played a role in security work. Many Security Committees often use small-scale forums, reading groups, night schools, and other methods to carry out propaganda and education on anti-espionage, fire prevention, and anti-theft to the people. When clearing up backlog cases and reviewing counter-revolutionaries under surveillance, the members of the street and rural Security Committees actively assisted the public security sub-bureaus and police stations in collecting mass opinions and feedback. For example, under the leadership of the Public Security Sub-bureau of the Seventh District, the Security Committees of each street mobilized the masses to assist the Public Security Sub-bureau in clearing up backlog cases and reviewing counter-revolutionaries under surveillance, verifying and supplementing a lot of materials, enabling these two tasks to be carried out smoothly.

    At present, the street and rural Security Committees are assisting the Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau in publicizing winter prevention work. Each public security station is adopting methods such as report meetings, discussion meetings, and seminars to organize the members of the Security Committees to study the policies and regulations, working methods, and working style related to security work, in order to improve their policy level and working ability, so that they can play a greater role in uniting the broad masses of the people and consolidating the revolutionary social order of the capital.

    团结广大人民巩固革命的社会秩序
    北京市城郊各区普遍建立治安保卫委员会
   【新华社十日讯】北京市城、郊各区已普遍建立群众性的治安保卫组织——治安保卫委员会。
    北京市建立治安保卫委员会的工作，是在镇压反革命运动获得胜利和广大人民政治觉悟普遍提高的基础上进行的。自从今年五月间北京市人民政府市长彭真提出了建立治安保卫委员会的号召以后，各界人民都热烈拥护，要求迅速成立。北京市人民政府公安局接受了广大人民的要求，先由各公安分局选择一、二个街道进行建立治安保卫委员会的典型试验。在建立街道治安保卫委员会的工作获得初步经验之后，各区就在十月间全面开展这一工作。绝大部分街道和郊区农村在建立治安保卫委员会前，都进行了充分的筹备工作。各公安派出所普遍组织了包括各方面群众积极分子参加的筹备委员会，进行宣传、选举等工作。
    在选举成立治安保卫委员会前，筹备委员会发动各群众团体和工商业各行业公会的基层组织的成员，组织宣传队或宣传组，经过群众会、娱乐晚会、座谈会、读报组、夜校、黑板报，或采取个别访问的方式，向市民进行深入的宣传，使广大市民知道建立治安保卫委员会的意义。
    北京市城、郊各区的街道和农村治安保卫委员会都是经过民主选举产生的。治安保卫委员会的选举，是由当地人民群众直接提出候选人名单，经过慎重的讨论，然后进行选举。由市民们直接选举出来的治安保卫委员会委员，包括各阶层人士，其中以工人、农民和家庭妇女最多。他们大部分是抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动和郊区土地改革运动中的积极分子。他们当选以后，工作热情和积极性更加提高。如在今年国庆节的保卫工作中，很多治安保卫委员会的委员日夜参加保卫工作。一个五十多岁的老太太不顾派出所的劝阻，也坚持工作了两个晚上。她说：“这是毛主席给我们的任务，我是群众选举出来的，两个晚上不睡觉算什么？”
    各街道、农村治安保卫委员会成立后都订立了治安公约，并写信给毛主席和北京市人民政府市长彭真，保证协助人民政府做好首都的治安保卫工作。成立较早的治安保卫委员会已在治安保卫工作中发挥了作用。许多治安保卫委员会经常采用小型座谈会、读报组、夜校等方式，向人民群众进行防奸、防谍、防火、防盗等宣传教育工作。在清理积案和审查受管制的反革命分子时，各街道、农村治安保卫委员会委员都积极协助各公安分局和公安派出所征集群众意见和反映。如第七区各街道治安保卫委员会在该区公安分局的领导下，发动群众协助该区公安分局清理积案和审查受管制的反革命分子，证实和补充了许多材料，使这两项工作能顺利进行。
    目前，各街道、农村治安保卫委员会正在协助市人民政府公安局宣传冬防工作。各公安派出所正在采用报告会、讨论会和座谈会等方式，组织治安保卫委员会的委员学习关于治安工作的政策法令、工作方式方法和工作作风，以提高他们的政策水平和工作能力，使他们在团结广大人民巩固首都的革命社会秩序中发挥更大的作用。
