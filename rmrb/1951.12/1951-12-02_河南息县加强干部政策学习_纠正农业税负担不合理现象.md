    Xixian County, Henan Province, Strengthens Cadre Policy Study to Correct Unreasonable Agricultural Tax Burden

    To the Editor: During the summer grain collection in Xixian County, Henan Province, this year, there were deviations in the calculation of burdens, and the burden calculation method for tenant farmers was not revised; the portion of the burden exceeding 25% of the tax rate was also not corrected. At the beginning of the autumn grain collection, the county immediately gathered more than 250 township financial and grain cadres for a nine-day training session on burden policies and calculation methods. After the study and testing, 95% of the cadres had a clear understanding ideologically, and they also studied methods to correct deviations. Because some calculation errors and policy implementation errors were not visible in the burden registration books, it was necessary to first publicize the policies and methods to the masses before thoroughly correcting the deviations. When correcting deviations in Balipeng Township in the suburbs of Xixian County, the relevant cadres were gathered to study and discuss the provincial government's revised method for tenant farmer burdens, and to study how newly divided households and original farming households should share the burden. They also studied how to deduct the portion of the land tax rate exceeding 25%. These issues were first agreed upon among the cadres, and then village mass meetings were held to explain what should be corrected and what should not be corrected. After the masses understood, the method of self-reporting and public discussion was adopted to determine the households that needed to be corrected (preliminary investigations were also conducted beforehand), and then corrections were made household by household. Finally, the results were posted for public comment to determine the amount of burden. As a result, out of 407 households in the township, 112 households needed correction. Among them, the burden of 39 households was underestimated in the summer, and after the correction, a total of 2,362.5 jin was added; the burden of 73 households was overestimated, and after the correction, the burden was reduced by 10,720 jin. After this method was implemented, the masses were satisfied. Farmer Li Jinfu said, "This is more reasonable. If it were like the summer grain collection, piling it up like that (high tax rate), no one would be willing to plant more land." Tenant farmer Duan Xiuliang said, "I calculated during the summer grain collection that there was not much left after paying the grain. With this correction, my burden has been reasonably reduced, and I will have more motivation to farm in the future." The above facts show that to correctly implement the burden policy, the cadres must first understand the policies and methods.

### 河南息县加强干部政策学习  纠正农业税负担不合理现象

    河南息县加强干部政策学习
    纠正农业税负担不合理现象
    编辑同志：河南息县在今年夏征中对负担计算有偏差，租佃负担办法没有修正；因税率超过百分之二十五而多负担部分还没纠正。秋征开始时，该县即召集了乡财粮干部二百五十多人，进行了九天关于负担政策和计算办法的训练。经过学习和测验，百分之九十五的干部在思想上都已明确起来，他们并且研究了纠正偏向的方法。因为有些计算上的错误与执行政策上的错误，在负担登记册上看不出来，所以必须首先向群众进行关于政策和办法的宣传，然后才能彻底纠正偏向。息县郊区八里棚乡在纠偏时，就召集有关干部研究讨论了省府修正租佃负担办法，研究新分户与原耕户应如何负担。田亩税率超过百分之二十五，其多负担部分应如何扣除。这些问题首先在干部当中取得了一致，然后再分村召开群众会，说明怎样就该纠正，怎样就不用纠正。待群众了解后便采取自报公议的办法，确定应改正的户（事前也要先摸底），再逐户纠正。最后张榜公布，征求群众意见，确定应负担数。结果全乡四百零七户中，应纠正的户数为一百一十二户，其中有三十九户夏季少算了负担，纠正后共多出二千三百六十二斤半；七十三户多算了负担，纠正后减轻了负担一万零七百二十斤。这一办法实行后，群众都感到满意。农民李金富说：“还是这样合理，要像夏征时，直往上累（税率高）谁也不愿多种地。”佃农段秀良说：“夏征时我曾算过，交了粮剩不多。有这次纠偏，我的负担合理地减轻了，往后种地也有劲了。”以上事实说明，要正确贯彻负担政策，就要首先使干部懂得政策与办法。
