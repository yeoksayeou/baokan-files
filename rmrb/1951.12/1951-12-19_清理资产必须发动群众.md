    Cleaning Up Assets Requires Mobilizing the Masses
    To carry out the work of cleaning up assets and verifying capital in industrial and mining enterprises, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to participate. This is because: cleaning up assets and verifying capital is a very arduous and meticulous task, and it cannot be completed smoothly without the active participation of all workers; moreover, through this work, the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the workers can be further enhanced. The asset cleanup work of the Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Factory fully proves this point. The management situation of the Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Factory was originally very chaotic. However, they fully mobilized the masses, and as a result, in more than a month, they thoroughly analyzed and tested the performance of the machines, and inventoried tools and materials. At the same time, in the inventory work, the workers understood the performance of the machines, had a clear understanding in their minds, and tapped the potential capacity of the machines, and the production efficiency immediately improved significantly. This is indeed as the workers of this factory themselves said: "Democratic reform has made the workers the masters, and cleaning up assets and verifying capital is asking us to be the managers of the household." The workers' awareness has been raised, which has laid the foundation for the increase production and practice economy movement and the implementation of economic accounting system.
    However, there are also some leading cadres of enterprises who do not understand the principle that cleaning up assets must mobilize the masses. They regard cleaning up assets as the work of a few administrative cadres. When a certain iron and steel company started cleaning up assets, it took a detour for this reason. At that time, this company was carrying out democratic reform, and the leading cadres mistakenly proposed that "democratic reform is the central work of the masses, and cleaning up assets is the central work of administrative cadres." They did not mobilize and educate the masses, and started the inventory. What was the result? When administrative cadres went to the workshop to take inventory, the masses quarreled with them. It is difficult to solve problems by carrying out inventory work in this situation. Sixty percent of the tools and spare parts could not be found, and even large motors could not be found. Fortunately, the leading cadres of this company quickly recognized this deviation and put forward improved methods. Otherwise, the inventory work would be difficult to achieve any results. This lesson should attract the attention of leading cadres of enterprises in various places. Most leading cadres of enterprises understand in principle that they must rely on the working class to run the enterprise well. However, when they encounter specific problems, they often only see the strength of the cadres and forget to rely on and mobilize the masses. These comrades should pay attention to implementing the spirit of relying on the working class in every specific work of enterprise production and management.

### 清理资产必须发动群众

    清理资产必须发动群众
    在工矿企业中进行清理资产核定资金工作，必须发动群众大家动手。这是因为：清理资产核定资金是十分繁重而细致的工作，没有全体工人的积极参加，就不可能顺利完成；而且，通过这个工作，可以进一步提高工人群众的积极性和责任心。萍乡煤矿机厂清理资产的工作充分地证明了这一点。萍乡煤矿机厂原来的管理情况十分混乱。但是，他们充分地发动了群众，结果，在一个多月的时间，彻底地分析、检验了机器的性能，清点了工具和材料。同时，在清点工作中，工人懂得了机器的性能，心中有了底，发掘了机器的潜在能力，生产效率立刻显著地提高了。这的确像这个厂的工人们自己所说的：“民主改革让工人做了主，清理资产核定资金是要我们来当家了。”工人的觉悟提高了，就给增产节约运动和实行经济核算制打下了基础。
    但是，也还有一些企业的领导干部不懂得清理资产必须发动群众的道理。他们把清理资产当成少数行政干部的工作。某钢铁公司在开始清理资产时，就因为这个原故走了弯路。这个公司当时正在进行民主改革，领导干部就错误地提出“民主改革是群众性的中心工作，清理资产是行政干部的中心工作”。他们没有向群众进行动员教育，就动手清点起来。结果怎样呢？行政干部到车间进行清点时，群众就和他们争吵起来。在这种情况下进行清点工作，就很难解决问题了。有百分之六十的工具备品找不到下落，甚至连大马达也找不见了。幸亏这个公司的领导干部很快地认识了这个偏差，并且提出了改进的办法。不然，清点工作就很难有什么收获。这个教训应该引起各地的企业领导干部注意。大多数的企业领导干部在原则上是懂得必须依靠工人阶级才能搞好企业的道理的。但是，他们一碰到具体问题，往往就只看到干部的力量而忘记了依靠群众发动群众。这些同志应该注意把依靠工人阶级的精神，贯彻到企业生产和经营管理中的每一个具体工作中去。
