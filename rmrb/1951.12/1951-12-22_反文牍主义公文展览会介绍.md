Following the expansion of its scope and the addition of new materials, the Anti-Bureaucratic Red Tape Public Documents Exhibition of Central Political and Legal Departments resumed its exhibition on the 17th of this month in the auditorium of the Central Ministry of Justice. Due to the contribution of materials by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the People's Supervisory Committee, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and other agencies, the number of exhibits has doubled compared to the original. There have been many visitors in recent days, and more than ninety agencies and organizations have registered to request visits. Some provincial and municipal agencies and organizations have also written to request that the entire content of the exhibition be introduced in the newspaper.

The first part of the exhibits, which is also the main part, consists of prominent examples of bureaucratic red tape in various aspects. Among them, "Public Document Travel" is the most eye-catching part. For example, a public document from the Southwest Ministry of Justice requesting the Central Government to answer questions regarding the debt relationship between rich peasants and landlords in the new district traveled for more than four months among several departments, including the Central Ministry of Justice, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Legislative Affairs Committee, and the State Council. It passed through fourteen major stations (ministries). If internal receiving, dispatching, and approval processes are included, it would be over a hundred stations. Two-thirds of this public document's travel time was spent on procedures such as "Regarding interpretation of regulations, please consult with..." and "Regarding interpretation of policies, it is not appropriate to offer opinions without authorization." The design diagram of the exhibition illustrates that this issue should preferably be referred to the Southwest Military and Political Committee first, and if it cannot be resolved, then it should be reported to the Central Government. It would only be necessary for the Central Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Internal Affairs to reach a consensus and report it to the Political and Legal Affairs Committee for approval, and then a reply could be sent.

"Layer-by-layer verification and complicated procedures" is a serious manifestation of bureaucratic red tape. Some public documents have gone through twenty-eight approval procedures within the agency, and some have gone through thirty-six receiving and dispatching checkpoints within the agency; even a receipt-style public document must be verified layer by layer up to the head of the department. The exhibition uses the example of the Beijing Municipal People's Government to illustrate that bureaucratic red tape is inseparable from overlapping institutions. Before the streamlining of its organizational structure, the Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal People's Government had seven or more levels in its organizational hierarchy, from the section receiving and dispatching, the office receiving and dispatching, the case handlers, the section chiefs, the division chiefs, the chief secretary, to the leaders. The pyramid-shaped diagram of public document travel leaves a deep impression. After a public document enters, it takes at least twenty procedures and up to thirty-two procedures to be sent out. However, after the Beijing Municipal People's Government streamlined its organization and reduced its levels, it now only takes a maximum of thirteen procedures and a minimum of three procedures to send it out. The phenomenon of backlog and delay of public documents is also alarming. The exhibition diagram shows many thick files, with the words "XX Agency XX Case Backlogged for XX Months" marked in red on the cover. It is noteworthy that the agencies listed include the Central Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Legislative Affairs Committee, and the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, almost encompassing the entire central political and legal departments. This illustrates the pervasiveness of the backlog and delay phenomenon. At the same time, the length of time that public documents are backlogged also illustrates the seriousness of the problem, with some public documents being backlogged for three months or even a year.

The exhibition also exposes the excessive number of unnecessary official communications. Formal public documents were issued for requesting materials, sending reports, sending records, and even sending a receipt. The exhibition points out that these types of issues can be resolved quickly by using telephone or face-to-face discussions without issuing official documents, which saves manpower, material resources, and time.

The second part of the exhibits uses various examples to highlight the harm of bureaucratic red tape to the country and the people: The China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration backlogged a public matter from the Chongqing branch, and the branch repeatedly sent telegrams to urge it, wasting a lot of telegraph fees. The Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Railways spent six or seven thousand words on official communications regarding a problem between cadres from their subordinate agencies living in the same dormitory, wasting a lot of manpower, material resources, and time (in fact, this matter could have been resolved through face-to-face discussion). The most serious case is the Zhongcheng District People's Court in Beijing, which forced a female worker to commit suicide by poisoning because it "did not accept cases without a formal submission."

The final part of the exhibition presents many specific ways to overcome bureaucratic red tape, in accordance with the "Simplified Public Document Convention" recently signed jointly by the central political and legal departments, many of which are illustrated by using vivid comparison methods. For example, the Ministry of Justice answered a question from a lower-level agency. The first half of the process was handled using the "document-to-document" method, and it was not resolved after thirty-nine days. The second half of the process was changed to using telephone and face-to-face discussions, and it was replied to in only seven days. The "Complex vs. Simple" chart illustrates that when forwarding a public document that is not handled by the department itself, some agencies keep a copy of the original and issue a separate document to forward it; some only issue a document and attach the original; some simply forward the original with an instruction, which can also solve the problem. Another chart illustrates that when cadres request leave due to illness, some issue formal public documents with official seals; some simply use a note; and some make a phone call and register it, which also solves the problem.

Among the ways to overcome bureaucratic red tape, the method of "collective office work to handle important public documents" is very impressive. It introduces an example from the Political and Legal Affairs Committee: After the members of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee studied a draft instruction submitted by the Ministry of Justice during collective office work, they reported their conclusions to the State Council on the same day. This can both pool wisdom and simplify and speed up the handling of matters. In addition, the Central Financial and Economic Committee also introduced a method of "reforming the receiving document register," which is also worthy of attention by agencies with a large number of subordinate units and many public document exchanges.

     反文牍主义公文展览会介绍
    中央政法部门反文牍主义公文展览会在扩大展览范围、增加新的材料以后，本月十七日在中央司法部礼堂继续展出。由于中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会、人民监察委员会、北京市人民政府等机关选送材料，参加展览，展览品的数量比原来增加了一倍。日来观众很多，登记要求参观的机关、团体已有九十多个单位。有些省、市的机关、团体也来信要求把展览内容全部在报上介绍出来。
    展览品的第一部分，也是主要部分，是文牍主义表现在各方面的突出例子。其中“公文旅行”是最引人注目的部分。如西南司法部请求中央解答新区富农、地主间的债务关系问题的一件公文，在中央司法部、政治法律委员会、内务部、法制委员会、政务院等几个部门间旅行了四个多月。其中经过了十四个大站（部），如果把内部的收发签批也包括在内，当在百站以上。这份公文的行期的三分之二的时间是消耗在“事关法规解释，请与……研究”、“事关政策解释，未便擅供意见”等程序上。展览会的设计图说明：这一问题，最好先请示西南军政委员会，如果解决不了，再报中央。只须由中央司法部和内务部商得一致意见报政法委员会核批后，即可办复。
    “层层核签、手续繁琐”是严重的文牍主义现象。有的一件公文在机关内部曾经过二十八次批签手续，有的一件在机关内也经过了三十六道收发关口；一件收条式的公文，也要层层签核到部门首长。展览会以北京市人民政府的例子来说明：文牍主义是和机构重叠分不开的。北京市人民政府在精简编制以前，秘书厅组织层次从科收发、处收发、承办员、股长、科长、主任秘书以至首长有七级以上。塔形的公文旅行图，给人以深刻印象。一件公文进来，从收文到发出，最少要二十道手续，最多要到三十二道手续。但在北京市人民政府精简编制、减少层次以后，现在最多的只要十三道手续，最少经过三道手续就可发出了。公文积压拖延的现象也是可惊的。在展览图上绘制有许多厚厚的卷宗，封皮上用红字标明着“××机关×案积压×个月”的字样。令人注意的是：它所列举的机关，有中央政治法律委员会、内务部、公安部、司法部、最高人民法院、最高人民检察署以及法制委员会、中国人民救济总会等，几乎包括了整个中央政法部门。这说明了积压拖延现象的普遍性。同时从公文积压的时间来看，也说明了问题的严重性，有些公文，竟然压了三个月甚至一年。
    不必要的行文太多，也被展览会揭露出来了。如要资料、送报告、送纪录，甚至送一纸收据，也都办了正式公文。展览会指出：这类问题，完全可以不行文，利用电话、面商就可以迅速解决的，这既节省人力，又节省物力时间。
    展览品的第二部分，用各种实例，突出地说明了文牍主义对于国家和人民的危害性：中国人民救济总会因为积压重庆分会一件公事，分会三番两次地拍电报来催，浪费了不少电报费，贸易部和铁道部因为所属下级机关干部同住一个宿舍发生问题，公文往返洋洋六、七千言，不知浪费了多少人力、物力和时间（其实，这件事用面商的办法就可以解决的）。最严重的是北京市中城区人民法院，因为“无呈文不受理案件”，逼使一个女工服毒。
    展览品的最后一部分，按照中央政法各部门最近联合签订的“简化公文公约”，提出了不少具体克服文牍主义的办法，其中好多是采用鲜明的对比法来说明的。如司法部解答下级机关请示的一个问题，处理的前一半过程，用“文来文往”办法，三十九天还没有解决，后一半过程改用电话、面商，仅仅七天就办复下去。在“繁与简”的图表上，说明抄转一件不由本部门办的公文，有的原件抄存一份，另办文转去；有的仅只办文，原件附转；有的就原件批送，也可解决。另一幅图表说明：干部因病请假，有的办正式公文、盖大印；有的就用一个便函；有的挂个电话，登记一下，也同样解决了问题。
    在克服文牍主义的办法中，给人印象很深的，是采取“集体办公处理重要公文”的办法。这里介绍了政治法律委员会的一个实例：司法部送审一件指示稿，政法委员会的委员在集体办公时研究以后，当天就把结论意见报政务院，这样，既能集思广益，处理事情又简便迅速。此外，中央财政经济委员会还介绍了“改革收文簿”的办法，也很值得所属单位较多、往来公文较多的机关注意。
