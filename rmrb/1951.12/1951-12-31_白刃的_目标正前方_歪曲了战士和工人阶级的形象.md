    "Target Straight Ahead" in "White Blades" Distorts the Image of Soldiers and the Working Class
    On December 2nd, this newspaper criticized the "Bloody Battle of Tianmen Peak" in "White Blades" (four chapters from the full-length "Fight Until Tomorrow"), pointing out that this work had serious errors in distorting the heroic qualities of the People's Liberation Army.

    The author's other work, "Target Straight Ahead" (one of the "Soldier Life Series," published by the Political Department of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army), similarly distorts reality, distorts the combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army, and also distorts the working class. The sixth and seventh issues of the first volume of "Liberation Army Literature and Art" have continuously criticized this popular literary work for the troops. These criticisms are beneficial for the author and for the improvement of literary creation.

    The author's intention is to use the story to criticize the "merit ideology" in the army and to explain why the working class is the leading class. However, the author completely inappropriately chose a representative figure of the People's Liberation Army—a combat hero—as the protagonist of the novel, concentrating many prominent backward thoughts (including petty-bourgeois thought and peasant thought, etc.) on him, making this former "steel platoon leader" who was "famous throughout the division" and also a "battle flag" and "special-grade shooter" in the army, suddenly become very backward for no reason after entering the city. He detests and insults female urban workers; compares living standards with workers; cannot stand the passengers in trains and the cadres in cars; and even gets so "angry" that he puts away his Mao Zedong Medal and denies the honor given to him by the Party and the people. The author fabricated such a hero and concocted a series of coincidental facts, insisting that the protagonist encounter a female worker several times and have a relationship that is neither romance nor not romance, in order to create his transformation and make him realize the greatness of the working class. Here, the author has abandoned the political work of the army and the leadership role of the Party and replaced it with the blind groping of individual soldiers. Isn't this distorting real life and distorting the heroic image of the People's Liberation Army?

    The author also made mistakes in expressing the working class and explaining why the working class is the leading class. He distorted the working class into a character who caters to the base psychology of overseers and bows and scrapes to the bourgeoisie. He explains the greatness of the working class from a consumption point of view ("workers' lives are hard"). Later, although production was mentioned, such as visiting factories, there was a lack of strong criticism of erroneous views. And in order to "prove" the "suffering" of the workers' lives, the author did not hesitate to fabricate plots, writing the lives of workers after liberation almost the same as the lives of workers during the reactionary rule, and writing the workers under the new democratic system led by the working class as being as vain and concerned with social niceties as vulgar petty citizens. In addition, the author also described the pre-liberation workers' factory protection movement as the individual adventurous actions of a few workers (female workers) using something akin to a "honey trap" against the enemy. Isn't this distorting the working class?

    "Target Straight Ahead" is an unrealistic and contrived work that uses artificial story twists and vulgar and low-level tastes to attract some backward readers, actually tarnishing the people's army and the working class. The reason for these serious shortcomings is that the author's literary and artistic thought has a rather strong petty-bourgeois tendency. The author should learn a lesson from this failure, comprehensively examine his own creative ideas, and correct his creative attitude.

### 白刃的“目标正前方”歪曲了战士和工人阶级的形象

    白刃的“目标正前方”歪曲了战士和工人阶级的形象
    十二月二日本报批评了白刃的“血战天门顶”（长篇“战斗到明天”中的四章），指出这个作品有歪曲人民解放军的英雄品质的严重错误。
    作者的另一作品“目标正前方”（“战士生活丛书”之一，中南军区及第四野战军政治部出版），同样也歪曲了现实，歪曲了人民解放军的战斗英雄，并且也歪曲了工人阶级。第一卷第六、七期“解放军文艺”已连续对这篇部队通俗文艺作品进行了批评。这些批评对于作者、对于文艺创作的改进都是有益的。
    作者的企图是通过故事来批评部队中的“功臣思想”，并阐明工人阶级为什么是领导阶级的思想。但是作者完全不适当地选择了人民解放军的代表人物——一个战斗英雄，作为小说的主角，将许多突出的落后思想（包括小资产阶级思想和农民思想等）集中在他身上，使这个过去“全师有名”的钢铁排长，也是部队中的一面“战旗”的“特等射手”，在进入城市以后，毫无理由地突然变得十分落后。他厌恶和辱骂城市女工；和工人比生活待遇；看不惯火车中的乘客和坐汽车的干部；甚至因此而“生气”得把自己胸前的毛泽东奖章都收起不戴，把党和人民给他的荣誉都否定了。作者捏造了这样的英雄，又虚构了一连串的巧合的事实，硬要叫主人公几次三番地和一个女工巧遇，发生一种似恋爱非恋爱的关系，以造成他的转变，使他认识工人阶级的伟大。作者在这里已经把部队政治工作、党的领导作用，一齐抛到了脑后，而代之以个别战士的瞎摸瞎碰。这难道不是歪曲现实生活、歪曲人民解放军的英雄形象吗？
    作者在表现工人阶级和说明工人阶级为什么是领导阶级这些问题上也犯了错误。他把工人阶级歪曲为迎合监工的下流心理、向资产阶级卑躬屈膝的人物。他从消费观点（“工人生活苦”）来说明工人阶级的伟大。后来虽然提到生产，如参观工厂等，但对错误的观点缺乏有力的批判。并且为了“证明”工人生活的“苦”，作者不惜捏造情节，把解放后的工人生活写得和反动派统治时期的工人生活差不多，把以工人阶级为领导的新民主主义制度下的工人，写成和庸俗的小市民一样的爱面子，讲究应酬交际。此外，作者还把解放前工人的护厂运动描写成少数工人（女工）向敌人使用类似美人计的个人冒险的举动。这难道不是歪曲工人阶级吗？
    “目标正前方”是一篇不真实的生拼硬凑的作品，利用人为的故事的曲折性和庸俗低级的趣味，来吸引一部分落后读者，实际上玷污了人民的部队和工人阶级。造成这些严重缺点的原因，是作者的文艺思想具有相当浓厚的小资产阶级倾向。作者应该从这个失败中接受教训，全盘检查自己的创作思想，改正自己的创作态度。
