    Central Railway Ministry's Imbalanced Vehicle Allocation
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Suffers Production Losses
    To the Editor: Due to the fluctuating number of freight cars allocated to the factory each day by the Central People's Government's Railway Ministry, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has incurred huge penalties for detention fees. The fines for just October alone reached 176,666,000 yuan, severely impacting the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's transportation work and the workers' production morale. (According to regulations, if a vehicle remains at the factory for more than eight hours, a fine of 600 yuan per ton is levied for each hour exceeding that time, with the fine doubling for exceeding two hours and increasing further for exceeding four hours).
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's monthly transportation plan is made according to the regulations of the Central Railway Ministry, but the arrival of vehicles from the Central Railway Ministry is very uneven. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant requests 25 vehicles every four hours, but sometimes the Railway Ministry sends 40 to 50 vehicles within three hours, and sometimes even 80 vehicles within four hours, exceeding the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's vehicle transportation, loading, and unloading capacity, forcing a large number of loading and unloading workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to frequently work overtime. Sometimes only 30 to 50 vehicles arrive in a day, causing uneven labor for the workers. Because a piece-rate wage system is implemented, workers' income is also directly affected, and workers generally express dissatisfaction. The uneven arrival of vehicles has further affected the production of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has repeatedly reported this issue to the Central Heavy Industry Ministry for transfer to the Central Railway Ministry for resolution, but the Central Railway Ministry has not provided a specific response. Until now, there has been no improvement in this matter, and the amount of fines has been increasing month by month. For example, it was 125,361,100 yuan in September and reached 176,666,000 yuan in October. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's loading and unloading workers have been discussing: "We are busy day and night, and we still get fined. How can we do economic accounting?"
    I believe that the Railway Ministry should seriously study the reasons for the uneven arrival of vehicles and make the greatest efforts to improve the current situation. Otherwise, it will cause great waste of state property. Xu Bingzhong

### 中央铁道部调拨车辆不平衡  石景山钢铁厂生产受损失

    中央铁道部调拨车辆不平衡
    石景山钢铁厂生产受损失
    编辑同志：因为中央人民政府铁道部每天来厂的货车数量忽高忽低，石景山钢铁厂遭受了巨额延点费的罚款。只是十月份一个月的罚款，就达一亿七千六百六十六万元，严重地影响了石景山钢铁厂的运输工作和工人的生产情绪（按规定，来车在厂超过八小时后，每吨超过一小时罚款六百元，超过二小时加倍罚款，超过四小时更要加倍）。
    石景山钢铁厂每月的运输要车计划，是按照中央铁道部的规定作的，中央铁道部的来车却很不平衡，如石景山钢铁厂要求每四小时来车二十五辆，但有时铁道部在三小时内就来车四十至五十辆，有时甚至四小时来车八十辆，超过石景山钢铁厂运车装车卸车能力，使石景山钢铁厂大批装卸工人时常不得不加班工作。有时一天只来车三、五十辆，使工人劳逸不均。因为实行计件工资制，工人收入也直接受到了影响，工人普遍表示不满意。来车的不平衡更使石景山钢铁厂的生产受到影响。
    对这个问题，石景山钢铁厂曾一再呈报中央重工业部转请中央铁道部解决，但中央铁道部并没有作具体的答复。直到现在，这件事仍然没有什么改进，罚款数却逐月上升，如九月份是一亿二千五百三十六万一千元，十月份竟达一亿七千六百六十六万元。石景山钢铁厂装卸工人纷纷议论：“不分黑夜白天都忙，还落个罚款，怎么搞经济核算呢？”
    我认为铁道部要认真研究来车不平衡的原因，作最大的努力以改进目前的情况。否则，就会给国家财产造成很大的浪费。    徐炳忠
