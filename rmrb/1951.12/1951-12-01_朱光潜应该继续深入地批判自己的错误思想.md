To the Editor:

Zhu Guangqian's article, "Some Reflections on Recent Studies," was enlightening to me. Zhu Guangqian had a profound influence on me in the past. As far back as middle school, I was influenced by his "Twelve Letters to Young People" and "The Psychology of Art." When Zhu Guangqian was the chairman of the Department of Western Languages at Peking University, he taught me "English Poetry" and "Aesthetics." Under the influence of his thought (of course, mainly because my class origin was the same as Zhu Guangqian's), I highly admired the "point of view of doing for nothing," believing that to be able to "appreciate the aspects of life and works of art as a picture," and to be able to "look at everything with a cold eye, feeling that all kinds of people and things are equally interesting" was to be cultured. Thus, to some extent, I also became a "monster who thought himself to be above politics and above society."

Since liberation, although I have had many transformations, and have made preliminary examinations and criticisms of this "cynical world-weariness" and "spectatorism" attitude, because of my low level, my understanding of the ideological source of this error is still very insufficient. Recently, in the study of examining this ideological source, I felt very difficult. Now, reading Zhu Guangqian's article, I further realize that the "quiet non-action" and "equal treatment" of life are "an extremely selfish and arrogant thought of the exploiting class," and more intimately realize that: "In the fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, advocating a 'middle road' and promoting 'supra-politics' will sooner or later be卷进 into the trap of the reactionary regime and 'become accomplices' with it." Thus, I more deeply realize that: in a class society, it is impossible for there to be people who are above class. But I think Zhu Guangqian should continue to deeply criticize himself. This is not only a matter of his personal transformation, but also a responsibility he should bear to those who have been influenced by him. At the same time, I hope that other teachers in institutions of higher learning who have erroneous thoughts can also thoroughly criticize themselves.

### 朱光潜应该继续深入地批判自己的错误思想

    朱光潜应该继续深入地批判自己的错误思想
    编辑同志：朱光潜所作“最近学习中几点检讨”一文，对我是有启发作用的。朱光潜过去对我的影响很深。远在中学的时候，我就受了他的“给青年的十二封信”、“文艺心理学”的影响。朱光潜在北京大学西方语文系当系主任时，教过我“英诗”和“美学”。在他思想的影响下（当然更主要的是我的阶级出身与朱光潜相同），我很推崇“无所为而为的观点”，认为要能“把人生世相和文艺作品当作一辐图画去欣赏”，要能“对一切都冷眼旁观，觉得种种人件件事都一样顶有趣”才是有修养。于是在某种程度上我也成了一个“自以为超政治而且自以为超社会的怪物”。
    解放以来我虽然有了许多转变，对这种“滑稽玩世”、“看戏主义”的旁观态度作了初步的检查和批判，但因为水平不高，对这种错误的思想根源的认识还很不够，最近在学习中检查这种思想根源时，就深感困难。现在读了朱光潜的文章，使我进一步认识到“清静无为”，“等量齐观”的生活态度是“剥削阶级的一个极自私自利和自高自大的思想”，更亲切地认识到：“在革命和反革命的猛烈斗争中标榜‘中间路线’，鼓吹‘超政治’，迟早总要卷进反动政权的圈套里去，和它‘同流合污’。”从而更深刻地体会到：在阶级社会中，是不可能有超阶级的人存在的。但我认为朱光潜还应该继续深入地批判自己。这不单是他个人改造的问题，也是他对受过他影响的人应负的责任。同时，希望其他有着错误思想的高等学校教师们，也都能彻底批判自己。
