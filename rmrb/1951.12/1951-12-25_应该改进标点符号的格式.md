    Should Improve the Format of Punctuation Marks
    To the Editor: Since the People's Daily published "Usage of Punctuation Marks" on September 26th, several newspapers, including the People's Daily, China Youth Daily, Northeast Daily, Changjiang Daily, Chahar Daily, Dalian People's Daily, Shenyang Daily, Liaodong Masses, and Inner Mongolia Daily, have improved the format of punctuation marks. For example, the People's Daily, starting from November 20th, has changed the punctuation marks (period, comma,顿号, semicolon, colon, question mark, exclamation mark – seven types in total) that were previously placed underneath the text and in the middle, to punctuation marks that still occupy one character space but are located in the upper right corner. In this way, significant spaces are revealed on the left side of the symbols, making the paragraphs appear distinct and very clear to the reader. However, "Usage of Punctuation Marks" has been published for nearly three months, and many provincial and municipal-level newspapers have not yet improved according to this method. Therefore, we suggest that these newspapers should conscientiously implement the regulations and improve the format of punctuation marks.

    应该改进标点符号的格式
    编辑同志：九月二十六日的人民日报发表了“标点符号用法”后，截至目前为止，已有人民日报、中国青年报、东北日报、长江日报、察哈尔日报、旅大人民日报、沈阳日报、辽东大众、内蒙古日报等几家报纸，改进了标点符号的格式。例如人民日报，从十一月二十日起，就把过去用在文字底下、正当中的标点符号（句号、逗号、顿号、分号、冒号、问号、感叹号等七种），一律换为仍占一个字的地位，但是位居右上方的标点符号。这样，符号的左侧就露出显著的空白，使读者看起来段落分明、十分清楚。但“标点符号用法”已公布近三个月了，还有很多省、市以上的报纸，没有依照这个办法改进。因此，我们建议这些报纸，应认真执行规定，改进标点符号的格式。
