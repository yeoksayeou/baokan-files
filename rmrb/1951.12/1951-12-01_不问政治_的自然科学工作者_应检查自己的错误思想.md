    Natural Science Workers Who "Don't Ask About Politics"
    Should Examine Their Erroneous Thoughts
    Comrade Editor: Dr. Yudin's "The Significance of Stalin's Writings on Linguistics for the Development of Social Sciences" (see the People's Daily, October 17th and 18th) discusses Stalin's writings on linguistics and extends to the field of natural sciences. Dr. Yudin explained that "natural sciences take organic and inorganic nature as their research objects, and they directly serve production," therefore, natural science itself is not class-based. However, in class society, because natural scientists all have different worldviews, and because natural science serves the economically dominant class, this gives natural science elements of a superstructure nature. I believe that Dr. Yudin's discussion here has significant practical significance for every natural scientist.
    When Dr. Yudin says here that natural scientists all have their own worldviews, he is referring to the issue of the standpoint taken by natural scientists. In our natural science circles, there has long been a widespread tendency to "not ask about politics." Some natural scientists believe that they are burying themselves in technical research and not asking who the results of their research serve, with the result that the reactionary class seizes the fruits of their research. This is just as Dr. Yudin said:
    "The ruling class openly and shamelessly uses natural science for its own political purposes to fight against the working class and against the laborers." This so-called "not asking about politics" is in essence serving reactionary politics. This is a question of standpoint. Natural scientists who have had the erroneous idea of "not asking about politics" in the past should examine themselves, seriously study Dr. Yudin's paper, study Marxism-Leninism, and firmly stand on the side of the people. Only in this way can they truly serve the people's construction cause and enable natural science to achieve new and higher achievements.

### “不问政治”的自然科学工作者  应检查自己的错误思想

    “不问政治”的自然科学工作者
    应检查自己的错误思想
    编辑同志：尤金博士的“斯大林关于语言学问题的著作对于社会科学发展的意义”（见十月十七、十八日人民日报），论述到斯大林关于语言学问题的著作，并扩展到自然科学的领域。尤金博士说明“自然科学是以有机的和无机的自然为研究对象，它们是直接替生产服务的”，因之，自然科学的本身不是有阶级性的。但是在阶级社会中，由于自然科学家都是各有不同的世界观，由于自然科学是替经济上占统治地位的阶级服务的，这就使自然科学带上了上层建筑性质的因素。我认为尤金博士的这一论述，对于每一个自然科学家来说，是有着重大的现实意义的。
    尤金博士在这里所说的自然科学家都有自己的世界观，就是指的自然科学家所采取的立场问题。在我们的自然科学界，长时期普遍地存在着“不问政治”的倾向。有些自然科学家，自以为埋头研究技术，而不问研究的成果为谁服务。致使反动阶级攫取了他们的研究的成果。这就正如尤金博士所说：
    “统治阶级为着本阶级的政治的目的而公开地和厚颜无耻地利用自然科学来同工人阶级、同劳动者作斗争。”这种所谓“不问政治”，实质上却是服务了反动的政治。这是一个立场问题。过去有着“不问政治”的错误思想的自然科学家应加以检查，并认真学习尤金博士的这一论文，学习马克思列宁主义，把脚跟站稳到人民方面。只有如此，才能够真正为人民的建设事业而服务，使自然科学获得新的更高的成就。    沈其东
