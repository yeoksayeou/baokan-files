Editor's Note: In April of this year, Li Ruilan, an agricultural labor model from Feixian County, Shandong Province, proposed response conditions to the patriotic abundance competition challenge from Li Shunda, an agricultural labor model from Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, and Zhang Fugui, an agricultural labor model from Wendeng County, Shandong Province. Now that the autumn harvest has ended, in order to thoroughly implement the challenge competition, Li Ruilan specifically wrote to comrades Li Shunda and Zhang Fugui to report on the production situation and results after responding to the challenge.

Comrades Li Shunda and Zhang Fugui:

Since responding to your challenge, everyone has worked even harder in production. All twenty-eight households in the village, with a total of forty-five male and female full and semi-laborers and thirty-four cattle and donkeys, have been fully organized. This year, our mutual aid team for exchanging labor calculates work and accounts based on labor. Because the mutual aid team is well organized, we have achieved: 1. Careful and meticulous cultivation, with an average of fifteen workdays spent per mu of land, applying fifty-five loads of fertilizer, plowing to a depth of more than one finger, harrowing twice, weeding sorghum eight times, weeding wheat three times, and weeding cotton ten times. All of this exceeded the original planned figures. 2. Improved technology, universally implemented field seed selection, and created methods for soaking seeds in "three-in-one yin-yang water," ash water, salt water, and boiling water. We also created "insecticide one-grab spirit" to kill underground pests. 3. Saved labor, with a total of 4,350 workdays saved in the whole village. As a result, thirty-eight rooms were built, one hundred and one drainage ditches were dug, five hundred and sixty zhang of dams were built, two hundred mu of mountains were closed off, and more than ten thousand trees were planted. All of this greatly exceeded the original plan. However, our production increase plan was not completed. This year, the average yield of millet per mu was 164 jin, a decrease of 21 jin from last year's average. The main reason for the reduced production was the severe drought that occurred in May and August this year. It was difficult to dig wells in the mountains, so there was not much irrigated land. Although production decreased, the income is still enough for us to eat and use this year, and we will have a surplus of more than ten thousand jin of grain. The people of the whole village say that if it were not for the leadership and organization of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the yield would have been at most fifty or sixty jin per mu this year. Although our income from agriculture has decreased, our income from sideline occupations has increased. This year, the village's income from cattle, pigs, chickens, mountain fruits, and other items reached 13,000 jin of grain, more than double the increase from last year. This is a new situation in our village. We are now engaged in winter plowing, reorganizing the mutual aid teams, organizing sideline production such as oil pressing and transportation, and preparing to set up winter schools to lay the ideological and material foundations for next year's great production campaign.

Li Ruilan

    报告向李顺达张富贵丰产竞赛应战结果
    编者按：今年四月间，山东费县农业劳动模范李瑞兰向山西平顺县农业劳动模范李顺达和山东文登县农业劳动模范张富贵的爱国丰产竞赛挑战提出应战条件。现在秋收已经结束，为了使挑战竞赛贯彻始终，李瑞兰特向李顺达、张富贵写信报告应战后的生产情况和结果。李顺达  张富贵同志：
    自向你们应战后，大家更加努力生产了。全村二十八户共有男女整半劳动力四十五人、牛、驴三十四头已全部组织了起来。今年我们的变工互助组是按劳力计工算账的，由于互助组组织得好，所以作到了：一、精耕细作，每亩地平均用到十五个工，施肥五十五挑，耕到一指多深，耙了两遍，高粱锄八遍、小麦锄三遍、棉花锄十遍，这都超过了原订计划规定的数字。二、提高技术，普遍实行了田间选种，并创造了三合阴阳水、灰水、盐水，开水浸种方法，还创造了杀虫一撮灵，杀除了地下虫害。三、节省了劳动力，全村共节省四千三百五十个工，因而盖了三十八间房，挖水沟一百零一道，砌坝子五百六十丈，封山二百亩，植树万余株，这一切大大超过了原订计划。但是我们的增产计划却没有完成，今年每亩平均产小米一百六十四斤，比去年平均减产二十一斤。减产的主要原因是由于今年五月和八月间发生了严重的旱灾，山地打井很困难，所以水浇地不多。虽然减产，但收入的仍够我们今年吃用，并能多余万余斤粮。全村人民都说，若不是共产党毛主席领导组织起来，今年每亩至多打五、六十斤。我们在农业上减少了收入，在副业上的收入却增多了。今年全村在牛、猪、鸡、山果等上面的收入达一万三千斤粮，比去年增收一倍多，这是我村的新情况。现在我们正在进行冬耕，整理变工互助组，组织副业生产如打油，运输等，并正筹办冬学，为明年大生产运动打下思想基础和物质基础。　李瑞兰
