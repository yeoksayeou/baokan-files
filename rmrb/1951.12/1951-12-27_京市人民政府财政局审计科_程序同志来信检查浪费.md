    Program Comrade from the Audit Section of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau Writes to Criticize Waste
    Comrade Editor: I work in finance. My main job is to review budgets and make calculations. Recently, during the study session of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, I reflected on my work and conducted a self-examination. I believe that if those responsible for auditing financial expenditures do not carefully analyze and investigate the expenses of various government agencies, and instead casually allocate funds, it can cause significant damage to the interests of the people.

    This winter, when reviewing the Beijing Public Security Bureau's request for leather overcoats for traffic police, I failed to conduct thorough research. I did not realize that the actual number of personnel was 292 fewer than the authorized number. I mechanically followed the authorized number of traffic police in Beijing and provided enough coats for each person. As a result, after the coats were distributed, 270 coats remained (including 203 newly made and 67 repaired old coats). The new leather overcoats (including hats) cost 974,744 yuan each, totaling over 197.87 million yuan for the 203 coats. Repairing the old leather overcoats (replacing the leather surface, washing the lining, etc.) cost approximately 660,000 yuan each, totaling over 44 million yuan for the 67 coats. The total cost amounted to over 240 million yuan.

    Auditing is an extremely detailed job. However, I spent my days trapped in the circle of bureaucracy, blindly allocating funds without conducting thorough investigations. This shows my lack of responsibility towards my work. During this vigorous anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, my understanding has improved. I have realized that although my actions do not constitute corruption, wasting the state's millet is also a serious crime. In addition to strengthening my sense of responsibility in future work, I also request that the higher authorities give me the appropriate punishment.

    Here, I would also like to mention Comrade Wang Kexing (currently the head of the Clothing Section of the Supply Department of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau), who is related to this matter. Comrade Wang Kexing was well aware that the actual number of traffic police in Beijing was more than 200 fewer than the authorized number, but he still ordered 350 coats, which was five more than the originally requested number. Furthermore, regarding the leather belts for the people's police, Comrade Wang Kexing knew that there were still old ones in stock that could be used with minor repairs. However, he entered into a contract with private merchants to make completely new ones before the budget was even approved. Comrade Wang Kexing claimed that we "don't solve problems," and we often had unnecessary disagreements in our work. The facts of waste prove that without strict adherence to the budget system, there will inevitably be many loopholes, leading to the loss of the people's property.

    I am willing to encourage each other with comrades who work in finance during this movement.    Cheng Xu

    京市人民政府财政局审计科
    程序同志来信检查浪费
    编辑同志：我做的是财政工作。我的主要业务是审核预算和计算。最近，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的学习中，我联系到我的工作，进行了检查。我认为经管审核财政开支的人员，如果对于各机关的开支，不仔细分析，不调查研究，就马马虎虎地拨款，会对人民的利益造成极大的损失。
    今年冬季，审核北京市公安局添制交通警察穿的皮外衣时，我没有调查研究，没有了解实有人数比编制人数少二百九十二人，就机械地照本市交通警编制人数，按每人一件补足。结果，这批皮外衣分发后，还剩下二百七十件（计新做的二百零三件，修理的旧衣六十七件）。新皮外衣（连帽子）每件九十七万四千七百四十四元，二百零三件共合一亿九千七百八十七万多元。修理旧的皮外衣（换皮面子、洗里子等）每件约六十六万元，六十七件共合四千四百多万元。总数合计二亿四千多万元。
    审计工作是一个极细致的工作。但是，我却整天钻在文牍主义的圈子里，不经过详密的调查研究，就盲目地拨款。这说明我对工作的责任心不强。在这次大张旗鼓反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我的认识提高了一步。我明确了，我的行为虽然不是贪污，但浪费了国家的小米，也是一种严重的犯罪行为。我除了加强今后工作中的责任心外，并请求上级给我应有的处分。
    这里，顺便提一下和这件事有关的王可兴同志（现任北京市人民政府公安局供给科被服股股长）。王可兴同志明明知道北京市交通警现有人数比编制人数差二百多人，但是王可兴同志却又做了三百五十件，比原定要做的件数还多做了五件。再如人民警察用的皮带，王可兴同志明明知道还存有旧的，稍加修理就能用，但是，他在没有批准预算前，就和私商订立合同，完全做了新的。王可兴同志说我们“不解决问题”，我们在工作中常常发生不必要的分歧意见。浪费的事实证明，不认真执行预算制度，就一定有不少的漏洞，就会造成对人民财产的损失。
    我愿意和做财政工作的同志们在这次运动中互勉。    程序
