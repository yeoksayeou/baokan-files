    East China Trade Department Investigation Proves
    Commodity Circulation Costs Can Be Greatly Reduced
    In early November, the Trade Department of the East China Military and Administrative Committee dispatched a commodity circulation cost investigation team to investigate thirteen first-level state-owned trading companies in the East China region in Shanghai. They collected 173 examples created by employees of various companies of saving circulation costs since the implementation of the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea pact. According to these examples, it is estimated that by the end of October, over 39 billion yuan in circulation costs had already been saved. The team's investigation proved that commodity circulation costs in the East China region's trading companies can be greatly reduced.
    The 173 examples show that there are many aspects of commodity circulation costs that can be saved, with loading and unloading, interest, packaging, and transportation costs being the largest savings. Of the 173 examples, over 10 billion yuan was saved in loading and unloading costs, over 17 billion yuan in interest, and over 7.5 billion yuan in selection, sorting, packaging, and transportation costs. These examples show which methods are most effective for saving. In terms of saving transportation costs, direct transportation and changing transportation methods saved the most, accounting for approximately 87.4% of the transportation cost savings. For example, in October, the East China Branch of the China Petroleum Company changed a batch of oil transported to Nanjing from barrel packaging to bulk, saving over 100 million yuan in oil transportation costs and empty barrel return costs. In terms of saving loading and unloading costs, direct handling, planned warehouse setup, renting docks, and direct warehousing saved the most, accounting for approximately 85% of the loading and unloading cost savings. For example, in the last two weeks of October, the East China Branch of the China National Department Store Company directly sent more than 5,000 boxes of goods to the dock for shipment, without entering or leaving the warehouse, saving over 300 million yuan in handling fees, warehouse rent, and other expenses. In terms of saving interest, the main focus was on reducing the backlog of funds and shortening the turnover of funds. In terms of saving packaging costs, the use of old materials, improved packaging methods, and self-processing to reduce intermediate exploitation saved the most, accounting for approximately 97.8% of the packaging cost savings. For example, in the past, the East China Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company did not recover the packaging skins when signing processing contracts with factories, resulting in significant waste. In September, the company recovered 60,000 sets of packaging skins from manufacturers, saving 500 million yuan. Based on this calculation, 5 billion yuan in packaging costs can be saved throughout the year.
    The above examples appeared before the full-scale launch of the production increase and savings competition. Therefore, if a mass-based production increase and savings competition is launched, and savings experiences are promoted in a timely manner, the amount saved will be truly astonishing.

    华东贸易部调查证明
    商品流转费大可节约
    华东军政委员会贸易部十一月初派出商品流转费用调查小组，调查了上海十三个华东区一级国营贸易公司，搜集了各公司职工从推行抗美援朝爱国公约以来所创造的一百七十三个节约流转费用的实例。据这些实例推算，到十月底为止，已经节约的流转费用就有三百九十多亿元。小组的调查证明了华东区各贸易公司商品流转费用很可以节约。
    一百七十三个实例显示，商品流转费用中可以节约的方面很多，其中尤以装卸搬运费、利息、包装费、运费四项节约的数目最大。一百七十三个实例中，节约的装卸搬运费是一百多亿元，利息一百七十多亿元，挑选整理包装费和运费共七十五亿多元。这些实例表明了用什么方法节约效果最大。在节约运费方面，以直接运输和改变运输方法节约的数目最多，约占运费节约数的百分之八十七点四。例如，中国石油公司华东区公司在十月份把一批运南京的油料改桶装为散装，节省油料运费和空桶回运费一亿多元。在节约装卸搬运费方面，以直接搬运，有计划地设置仓库，租用码头和直接入仓三种方法省费最多，约占装卸搬运费节约数的百分之八十五。例如，中国百货公司华东区公司在十月下旬的两星期内，把五千多箱货物直接送码头运出，不再进仓、出仓，节约了搬运费、仓租等费用三亿多元。节约利息方面，主要是减少积压资金和缩短资金周转。节约包装方面，以利用旧材料、改进包装方法和自行加工减少中间剥削三种方法节约最多，约占包装费节约数的百分之九十七点八。例如，中国花纱布公司华东区公司过去和工厂订立加工合同时，没有收回包皮，浪费很大。九月份该公司向厂家收回包皮六万套，节约五亿元。按此推算，全年可以节省包装费用五十亿元。
    上面这些实例是在还没有全面开展增产节约竞赛运动的时候出现的。因此，如果开展了群众性的增产节约竞赛运动，并且及时推广节约经验，节约的数目一定十分惊人。（新华社）
