    Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign Universally Launched in North China-Level Agencies and Organizations; Now Entering the Stage of Confessions, Exposing, and Reporting Corruption and Waste
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign that began around December 1st in the directly affiliated organs of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, North China-level people's organizations, and North China People's Revolutionary University, has now been universally launched and has successively entered the stage of confessions, exposures, and reports around the 10th. As the movement gradually deepens, the phenomena of corruption and waste discovered are increasing daily. At the beginning, some units did not sufficiently recognize the profound significance of this movement and underestimated the seriousness of corruption and waste. This bias has been largely corrected. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres to participate in the anti-corruption movement is increasing day by day, preparing good conditions for further developing this movement.
    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in North China-level agencies was launched after responsible comrades mobilized the masses multiple times, conducted studies, raised the masses' awareness, and overcame various erroneous ideological resistances. The ideological resistance in the movement came from the following three aspects: First, some people leading the movement in certain units felt that the anti-corruption issue was just about studying documents and did not have much practical content. They believed that in high-level leading organs, there were many experienced and strong veteran cadres and few new cadres, and they were not in charge of money, so the problem was not significant. Therefore, they relaxed the ideological leadership of this movement in their thinking and practical actions. Second, some cadres had a resistant attitude, and some held a passive attitude. They thought: "We are ordinary cadres, not in charge of money or grain, so where would corruption come from? There's no need to check us"; "There's no way to be corrupt, no power to waste, no share in anything; when it comes to anti-corruption, that's the business of the financial and economic departments, and anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy is the business of the higher-ups, it's nothing to do with us"; some also said: "Our agency is newly established, the people are new, the money is very little, there's no such thing, we have problems to complain about"; some young comrades said: "We just came out of school, we're not in charge of money, and we have no old society habits, we're clear, no need to investigate"; some veteran cadres also echoed: "Life is simple, you can see there's nothing"; some people even said: "Does one act of corruption count as corruption? I can't understand." All these views and understandings affected the smooth development of the movement. Third, those with problems, such as those who were corrupt, accepted bribes, or engaged in serious waste, initially interrupted the conversation, saying "How can there be so much corruption?" "Why another anti-corruption campaign after the cadre review? What is the purpose?" Then they entangled themselves in trivial issues or terminology, attempting to divert the target; or they asked around for information, probing the truth; even worse, they ran to relevant stores to make arrangements, to prevent exposure.
    In response to the above situation, Comrade Liu Lantao, on December 4th and 6th, according to the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and combining with the serious corruption cases that have already been discovered in North China, gave two reports at a meeting of cadres above the department-level; Comrade Bo Yibo also reported at a meeting of high-level Party, government, military, and civilian cadres in North China on the significance of carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, criticized various incorrect and erroneous understandings, and called on Party organizations at all levels in North China, governments and people's organizations at all levels, various military organs and troops, all schools, and all enterprises, factories, mines, and financial departments to launch a mass anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement without exception, and to deepen this movement all the way to the district and village organizations and the masses of the people. These reports and the instances of corruption exposed in the movement awakened all the cadres, making the majority of comrades gradually understand the serious political significance of the anti-corruption movement – opposing the invasion and corrosion of bourgeois ideology; eliminating hesitation, neglect, paralysis, and lack of enthusiasm; arousing the indignation of all staff towards corruption, bribery, and waste; raising the enthusiasm of the masses; blocking all the excuses of corruption and waste elements, promoting their ideological awareness, and greatly advancing the movement.
    On the basis of the increased awareness of the broad masses of staff, the departments and commissions of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, North China-level people's organizations, revolutionary universities, and other agencies have now widely launched the confession, exposure, and reporting movement. The current situation of this movement is:
    First, the corruption phenomena occurring in various agencies not only occur among managers, procurement personnel, and reception personnel, nor only in general affairs, construction departments, and cooperatives, but also in various forms of corruption discovered in the purchase of books, management of membership fees, and buying and returning train tickets. Even some people privately altered receipts and reported more than they spent when claiming travel expenses, medicine expenses, and food expenses. The amount of corruption ranges from as little as seven thousand yuan to as much as two or three million yuan. Some of the above-mentioned corruption occurred after entering large cities such as Beijing, but much of it also occurred while working in counties and districts. These facts break the saying that "if you're not in charge of money, you can't be corrupt." Because some people who covet petty gains, pursue enjoyment, cannot be cautious in solitude, and have the ideological consciousness of the exploiting class will be corrupt as long as they can get their hands on money. Although some people are still trying to deny it, those comrades who have already confessed all hate their shameful behavior, believing that if it were not for Chairman Mao's instructions against corruption and waste, they would inevitably sink deeper and deeper, and before long, they could become major corrupt officials, intolerable to national law and Party discipline. Some comrades said: "The country and the people have already provided us with everything necessary for our lives, and our standard of living is much better than that of farmers or even workers, but why do we still engage in corruption? This is entirely a reflection of the bourgeois selfish and profit-seeking exploitation ideology, and therefore must be thoroughly reformed."
    Second, many people who are frequently in contact with merchants, such as purchasing personnel, etc., because their position is unstable, are often induced by merchants, accept bribes from merchants, ranging from being invited to dinner, movies, gifts, loans of money, to bribes of millions of yuan, and introductions to wives. Those who have already confessed believe that unscrupulous merchants are trying to find the weaknesses of cadres in every way. In order to achieve their goals, unscrupulous merchants are very "generous" at the beginning, but once you're hooked, they want you to "take care" of them, sell you bad things, and demand high prices, and even two stores collude to boast to each other and deceive the public. One unscrupulous merchant introduced a wife to a comrade, and because the organization did not approve it, he was very dissatisfied, and in fact, he had already established a relationship with that unscrupulous merchant emotionally. One comrade, in the anti-corruption movement, prepared to confess, so he went to discuss it with the merchant who had bribed him, and the merchant resolutely refused to let him confess. Many comrades said after confessing and exposing these phenomena, "It's really heartbreaking, the more I think about it, the more dangerous it is. If you eat someone's food, you'll be soft-spoken; if you use someone's hand, you'll be soft-handed, and you'll slowly completely listen to the merchant's command and take a two-faced attitude towards the organization. What kind of person would I become then!" Some comrades said: "Unscrupulous merchants are too hateful, they want to turn me into a criminal of the Party and the state." Many comrades said that they are now aware of it, and will never be fooled by these degenerates again, and demand that the government must give these bad people who bribe everywhere and undermine the anti-corruption movement the punishment they deserve according to the severity of the circumstances.
    Third, many cadres in North China-level agencies were transferred from various provinces, and in the movement, they also began to expose the corruption and waste phenomena in their original work areas.
    More materials on waste were exposed in this movement. There were phenomena of waste in construction, car rides, the use of water and electricity, entertaining guests, typing and printing, and the lives of senior cadres. False budgets, failure to hand over surpluses, and misappropriation of public funds were not uncommon. Some deposited public funds in banks to generate interest, turning the interest into "small household expenses" to improve their lives and solve welfare problems. The number of large and small household expenses in various agencies and units is astonishing, and even a breeding squad has its own household expenses for its free disposal.
    Many comrades themselves had no corruption or major waste, but they also ideologically examined many problems. Some comrades said: "The idea of enjoyment is indeed becoming more and more developed! In the early days of entering the city, everything was still simple and frugal, but it slowly changed. I wanted to be particular about clothing, food, housing, beds, quilts, shoes, and socks, otherwise I felt embarrassed"; some said: "After a deep examination, the bourgeois ideology has indeed invaded my mind, and I want everything to be extravagant"; others criticized the erroneous idea of "personal first, small public second, and big public third." As for the phenomenon of not distinguishing between public and private, it is quite common.
    The responsible comrades of many units, in their mobilization reports, all related to bureaucracy and reviewed their lack of vigilance against the influence of bourgeois ideology, and therefore failed to diligently inspect, strengthen education, and prevent early. If it were not for Chairman Mao's instructions, more serious problems would inevitably arise, causing more cadres to fall into the quagmire of corruption and waste.
    In order to unify and strengthen the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement of the Party, government, army, and people's organizations at the North China level, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee established the North China-Level Economy Inspection Committee on December 17th, with Liu Lantao as the director and Tang Yanjie and Ping Jiesan as the deputy directors. At this meeting, in addition to Comrade Liu Lantao's detailed explanation of the significance, principles, and policies of this rectification movement, which is to vigorously carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, it was also decided that: (1) Units that have not yet started, such as the departments of the North China Military Region, the command organs of various special arms, the North China Affairs Department, and the North China Cooperative General Society, should start immediately, and the units that have already started should seize the time to carry out the movement. It is expected that the North China-level agencies can come to an end by the end of January next year. (2) All units should submit reports and plans by December 21st, which will be reviewed and approved by the committee; afterwards, a standing committee meeting (seven people) will be held once a week to check the progress and issue instructions in a timely manner. (3) In addition to the instructions already given by the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the military region, trade union, Youth League, and North China Cooperative General Society will all issue instructions, calling on all staff members of their subordinate levels to actively participate in this movement, and Communist Party members and Youth League members should play an exemplary role. (4) In addition to seizing the anti-corruption movement in the agencies, all departments must strengthen leadership in the agency's production, send out inspection teams, and assist them in carrying out this movement.
    (5) The offices and liaison offices of various provinces and military regions in Beijing will be the responsibility of the General Office of the North China Bureau and the North China Military Region, respectively, and the same guidance will be given to carry out the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement, and no exceptions will be allowed. (6) All agencies must convene a party congress of directly affiliated agencies during or after the movement to review leadership, improve work, and re-elect the party committee to strengthen the party's work in the agencies, strengthen ideological and political education, improve organizational life, and consolidate the results of the rectification.

    华北级各机关团体反贪污反浪费运动普遍展开
    现已进入坦白揭发和检举贪污浪费阶段
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局直属机关、华北级各人民团体和华北人民革命大学等单位，在十二月一日前后开始的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动，现已普遍展开，并在十日左右先后进入了坦白、揭发和检举的阶段。由于运动的逐渐深入，发现的贪污浪费现象逐日增多。在开始时，曾有些单位对这个运动的深刻意义认识不够，对贪污浪费的严重性估计不足。这种偏向大体上已被纠正。因此，广大干部参加反贪污运动的积极性日益增高，为进一步开展这个运动，准备了良好的条件。
    华北级各机关反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动，是经过负责同志多次动员，进行了学习，提高了群众觉悟，克服了各种错误的思想阻力之后开展起来的。运动中的思想阻力系来自下列三个方面：一、某些单位领导运动的人，觉得反贪污问题只是学学文件而已，没有多少实际内容。他们认为，在高级领导机关，老干部多且强，新干部少，又不管钱，问题不大，因此，在思想上和实际行动上都放松了对这一运动的思想领导。二、若干干部有抵触情绪，若干人抱有消极态度，他们觉得：“咱们是一般干部，既不管钱，又不管粮，那里来的贪污？没个检查头”；“贪污没门，浪费没权，都没份；说到反贪污，那是财经部门的事，反浪费反官僚主义是上边的事，咱没啥”；也有的说：“咱这机关是新成立的，人是新来的，钱是很少的，没有那类子事，我们是诉苦问题”；有些青年同志说：“刚从学校出来，一不管钱，二无旧社会习染，清清楚楚，不用查”，有些老干部也顺着说：“生活简单，一看就没有啥”；有的人甚至说：“贪污一次也算贪污吗？想不通”。所有这些看法和认识，都影响了运动的顺利开展。三、有问题的人，如贪污、受贿、严重浪费的人，始则打岔话，说“那有那么多的贪污？”“为什么审干之后，又来个反贪污，目的何在？”继则在枝节问题上或名词上纠缠起来，企图转移目标；或则到处打问风声，试探虚实；更恶劣的还跑到有关商店安顿一番，防止暴露。
    针对以上情况，刘澜涛同志在十二月四日和六日，根据中共中央的指示，结合华北现已发现的严重贪污事件，在处长以上干部会议做了两次报告；薄一波同志又在华北级党、政、军、民高级干部会议上，报告了开展反贪污反浪费和反官僚主义运动的意义，批判了各种不正确的和错误的认识，号召华北各级党的组织，各级人民政府和人民团体，各种军事机关和各部队、各学校及一切企业厂矿、财经部门，均应无例外地大张旗鼓地开展一个群众性的反贪污反浪费和反官僚主义的运动，并且要把这个运动一直深入到区、村组织和人民群众中去。这些报告和在运动中揭发的贪污实例，唤醒了所有的干部，使多数同志逐渐明确了反贪污运动的严重政治意义——反对资产阶级思想的侵袭和腐蚀；排除了犹豫、忽视、麻痹以及劲头不足等现象；激发了全体工作人员对于贪污、行贿、浪费行为的义愤，提高了群众的积极性；堵塞了贪污浪费分子的一切藉口，促进了他们的思想自觉，使运动大大前进了一步。
    在广大工作人员觉悟提高的基础上，中共中央华北局各部委、华北级各人民团体、革命大学等机关，现已广泛地展开了坦白、揭发和检举的运动。目前这一运动的情况是：
    一、各机关发生的贪污现象，不仅出在管理人员、采购人员和招待人员中，也不仅出在总务、修建部门和合作社，在购买图书、管理会费，买、退车票等方面，都发现了各种形式的贪污，甚至有些人在领路费、报药费、报伙食等方面，都要私改单据，少花多报。贪污款项，小至七千元，多至二、三百万元。上述贪污情形，有的人是在进北京等大城市后贪污的，但也有不少是在县区工作时贪污的。这些事实，打破了“不管钱，不能贪污”的说法。因为某些贪图小利、追逐享受、不能慎独、具有剥削阶级思想意识的人，只要能接触到钱，他就会贪污的。虽然还有些人企图抵赖，但已经坦白了的同志，莫不痛恨自己这种可耻的行为，认为如果不是毛主席反贪污浪费的指示，必然愈陷愈深，不用多久，就可能成为一个大贪污犯，为国法党纪所不容。有的同志说：“国家和人民，已供给我们生活上所必要的一切，生活程度比农民甚至比工人要强得多，但为什么还贪污呢？这完全是资产阶级自私自利的剥削思想的反映，因而必须痛改。”
    二、许多经常和商人接触的人，如采买人员等，因自己立场不稳，经常受商人引诱、接受商人贿赂，少至请吃饭、看戏、送东西、借给钱，多至贿赂百万元，给介绍老婆等。已经坦白了的人，认为奸商是无孔不入地在找干部的弱点。奸商为了达到他的目的，开始很“慷慨”，但一上钩，就要你“照顾”他，卖给你坏东西，得拿大价钱，甚至两家商店勾结起来，互相吹嘘，欺骗公家。有一个奸商给某同志介绍了老婆，因组织上批不准，他还大为不满，实际在感情上已经和那个奸商联系起来了。有一个同志，在反贪污运动中，准备坦白，即去和贿赂他的商人商量，商人坚决不让他坦白。很多同志在自己坦白、揭发出这些现象后说“实在痛心，越想越危险，吃上人的嘴软，使上人的手软，慢慢就会完全听了商人的指挥，对组织采取两面态度。那时我会变成一个什么样的人呢！”有的同志说：“奸商太可恨了，他是要把我变成一个党和国家的罪犯的。”很多同志表示现在觉悟了，再也不上这些败类的当了，并要求政府必须按情节轻重，给这些到处行贿而又破坏反贪污运动的坏人以应得的处分。
    三、华北级机关从各省调来的干部很多，在运动中，他们对原来工作地区的贪污浪费现象，也开始进行了揭发。
    在这个运动中揭发的浪费材料更多，在修建、乘坐汽车、使用水电、请客招待、打字印刷、高级干部的生活等方面都有浪费现象。虚报预算，结余不交，挪用公款等，也不是少数。有的把公款存在银行生息，将利息变成“小家务”，以改善生活，解决福利问题。各机关各单位大小家务之多是令人惊异的，甚至一个饲养班也有自己的家务，供其自由支配。
    很多同志本身并无贪污也无大的浪费行为，但也从思想上检查出不少问题，有的同志说：“享受思想的确是越来越发展了！进城初期，一切都还艰苦朴素，但慢慢地变了，穿衣、吃饭、住房、床、被、鞋、袜都想讲究点，不然觉得不好意思”；有的说：“深刻检查起来，资产阶级的思想确实已经侵入我的头脑，什么也想阔气点”，也有的同志批判了“个人第一，小公第二，大公第三”的错误思想。至于公私不分的现象，则是相当普遍的。
    很多单位的负责同志在动员报告中都联系到官僚主义，检讨了对资产阶级思想影响的警惕不够，因而未能勤于检查，加强教育，及早预防，如果不是毛主席指示，必然会产生更严重的问题，使更多的干部陷入贪污浪费的泥坑。
    中共中央华北局为统一并加强对华北一级党、政府、军队和人民团体的反贪污、反浪费及反官僚主义运动，已在十二月十七日成立了华北级节约检查委员会，以刘澜涛为主任，唐延杰、平杰三为副主任。在这次会议上，除由刘澜涛同志详细阐明这次整风即大张旗鼓开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义、方针、政策等问题外，并决定：（1）华北军区各部各特种兵司令机关、华北事务部、华北合作总社等尚未开始的单位，一律即速开始，已开始的各单位要抓紧进行，预计华北级机关可在明年一月底前告一段落。（2）十二月二十一日以前各单位一律做出报告和计划，由委员会核批；以后每周开一次常委会（七人），检查进行情况，及时发出指示。（3）除中共中央华北局已有指示外，军区、工会、青年团、华北合作总社都将发出指示，号召所属下级的全体工作人员均要积极参加这一运动，共产党员和青年团员要起模范作用。（4）各部门除抓紧机关反贪污运动外，对于机关生产必须加强领导，派出检查组，协助他们开展这个运动。
    （5）各省各军在北京的办事处、留守处等，分别由华北局办公厅和华北军区负责，一样的指导其进行反贪污浪费的运动，不允许有例外。（6）各机关在运动中或运动后，均须召开直属机关党的代表大会，检查领导，改进工作，改选党委会，以加强机关党的工作，加强思想、政治教育，健全组织生活，巩固整风成果。
