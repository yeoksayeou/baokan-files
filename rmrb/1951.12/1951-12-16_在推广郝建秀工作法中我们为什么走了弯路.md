Why Did We Take a Detour in Promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method

Zhang Zhenhua, Deputy Director of the State-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory

The state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory took a detour in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. This was mainly due to serious errors in our leadership's ideology. The People's Daily's criticism of us is completely correct.

Recently, we have held two cadre meetings to examine our thinking, and a fine yarn workers' meeting to summarize and review our work. At the same time, we have reorganized and strengthened the organizational leadership of the promotion work. Through profound self-criticism, we have initially reversed the conservative thinking and complacency among the cadres, and the morale of the masses has been greatly enhanced. The fine yarn workers participating in the study have reduced the roller lapping rate by 3% to 14% compared to before the promotion, with an average of 0.29% roller lapping rate per 600 spindles. Kang Dezhen, who has the lowest roller lapping rate, has a roller lapping rate of 0.29% per 1,000 spindles (32-count yarn). Production has also increased. The workers' ability to manage machines has increased from 500 spindles to 600 spindles. In terms of quality, bad yarn has been reduced by more than 40%, and the yarn breakage rate has also been significantly reduced. Now, not only fine yarn workers, but also doffers are actively learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

The Root of Erroneous Thinking

Why did our factory take a detour in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method? This is mainly due to blind complacency and conservative thinking on the part of the leadership. These ideas have their social and ideological roots and material basis.

First, in the past, our factory had an incorrect view of the fine yarn tending worker's work method: "Everything obeys piecing, everything revolves around piecing; as long as piecing is fast and piecing is good, it is a good work method." Under the guidance of this theory, workers were forced to piece as hard as possible, and they were called upon to achieve "three diligences and three speeds" in their operation. This actually promoted an unlimited increase in the intensity of labor, causing the machines to control the workers. This is essentially a bourgeois technical viewpoint. The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is completely different from this. Its basic characteristic is that workers master the machines, so the operation is regular, rational, and can reduce the intensity of labor. In our socialist state-owned enterprises, the old technical viewpoints have not been thoroughly liquidated, and the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method cannot but go through ideological struggle and practical education. When our factory started the promotion, we did not organize the cadres to study and discuss the Hao Jianxiu Work Method well. Therefore, everyone only blindly worshiped the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The so-called promotion was only to pursue certain actions of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in form, and let the workers imitate mechanically. In this way, the workers could not grasp the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and the promotion work could not achieve the expected results. When problems occurred in the promotion work, everyone lost confidence and could not carefully analyze and work hard to overcome difficulties. At this time, the old viewpoints on technology once again occupied a dominant position, and some people even opposed regular patrols, suspecting that the practice of "taking piecing as the main task" might not be wrong.

Second, related to the previous problem is the serious conservative thinking and complacency of the leadership cadres and general cadres of our factory. The roller lapping rate of fine yarn in our factory is relatively low, with an average of 0.5% for the whole factory. The roller lapping rate of Meng Shuyuan, a fine yarn worker, was even lower than Hao Jianxiu's for a period of time. After the promotion of the Meng Shuyuan Work Method and the Kovalev Work Method in September, it dropped to 0.33%, with the lowest reaching 0.13%. This achievement is related to the machine conditions and the pre-spinning situation of our factory. Some cadres did not see this point, and became proud as a result. Based on this kind of thinking, some cadres had doubts about the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. They doubted "whether the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in Factory No. 1 can further reduce the roller lapping." When the roller lapping did not decrease but increased in the early stage of promotion, some cadres produced erroneous arguments such as "the roller lapping in Factory No. 1 may not be reduced any more" and "the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is not as good as Meng Shuyuan's Work Method." This is the second reason why the promotion work suffered losses.

Third, the summarization and promotion of all advanced experiences are the combination of politics and technology. Without the ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to produce scientific operating methods. Therefore, to implement advanced work methods, it is necessary to carry out ideological struggle. The leading cadres of our factory did not have a clear understanding of this issue. Before the promotion, our factory did not conduct in-depth ideological mobilization and education, and did not criticize the backward and conservative thinking. At that time, the leadership mistakenly regarded the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method as a purely technical issue, thinking that they did not understand technology and could not lead well, so they pushed the promotion work to a few technical cadres, and therefore did not rely on the masses and mobilize the masses. This is the main reason for the failure of the promotion work, and also a serious lesson.

Why Roller Lapping Cannot Be Reduced

After we exposed and criticized the ideological roots of the deviations that occurred, we began to go deep into the workshops to conduct measurements and find the reasons why the roller lapping could not be reduced. During the inspection, we discovered the following two problems:

(1) To reduce the roller lapping rate, it is necessary to shorten the laying time. The laying time (that is, the time consumed from the breakage to the piecing) is one of the main reasons for the large amount of white waste. Why is the laying time long? We found that: first of all, the workers' patrol time is unbalanced, sometimes long and sometimes short. Some workers use a minimum of one and a half minutes for one patrol, and a maximum of ten minutes and fifty-five seconds, with an average of four and a half minutes, that is, the laying time after breakage ranges from one and a half minutes to ten minutes and fifty-five seconds, so of course there is a lot of roller lapping. Secondly, the operation during the patrol is not planned. For example, some workers do as many as thirteen tasks at most, and only wipe the board once at least. The amount of cleaning work done by the workers is also different, which also prolongs the laying time after breakage.

(2) To reduce roller lapping, it is necessary to reduce breakage. The increase or decrease in the breakage rate is not entirely determined by the strength of the fine yarn tending worker, and all aspects must cooperate. For example, the adjustment of temperature and humidity, the weight of the yarn count, the quality of the mixing components, the quality of the roving, and the quality of the bobbin all directly affect the amount of breakage. During the measurement, we found that the breakage rate in the middle of a doffing is also different: the breakage rate of medium yarn is the lowest, followed by large yarn, and the breakage rate of small yarn is the highest. Therefore, the tending worker should pay more attention to preventing the breakage of small yarn. The tending worker's poor cleaning work and unskilled operation are also important reasons for the high breakage rate. These situations show that it is not that the roller lapping of our factory cannot be reduced, let alone that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is not good, but that we have not correctly promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

After finding the reasons why the roller lapping could not be reduced in the measurement, we educated the workers and let the "little teachers" go back to the machines to practice again, and continue to correct errors from the practice. As a result of the practice, the roller lapping rate decreased, the workers' ability to manage machines increased, and the leadership's complacency and conservative thinking no longer had a market. The doubting and resisting emotions among the masses were also eliminated, and everyone urgently requested to learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Now we are comprehensively promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

Northwest Region Focuses on Inspecting the Promotion of Hao Jianxiu Work Method

Some Yarn Factories Still Do Not Pay Attention to the Promotion Work, Making It Impossible for It to Proceed Smoothly

Recently, the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau and the Northwest Region Committee of the China Textile Trade Union inspected the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau No. 1 Factory, Xi'an Dahua Yarn Factory, Xin Northwest Yarn Factory, and Weinan Juji Yarn Factory. The inspection results proved that the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method has achieved great success, and the roller lapping rate of the workers who have learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in various factories has generally decreased by 30% to 40%. More than 70% of the fine yarn workers in the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau No. 1 Factory are now Hao Jianxiu workers. The workers in other workshops have used the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and have also made significant achievements. Dahua Yarn Factory worker Du Yunlong and others used the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to weave cloth, weaving 45.8 yards of cloth per loom in ten hours, creating the factory's highest record. Long Fei, a worker at the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau No. 1 Factory, used the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to reel yarn, and the output also increased by more than one-quarter.

However, there are also some leading cadres of yarn factories and capitalists of private yarn factories who do not pay enough attention to the promotion work, making it impossible for the promotion work to proceed smoothly. For example, the capitalists of the private Weinan Juji Yarn Factory did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method; they did not allow the representatives attending the fine yarn meeting to leave production, so that no one was responsible for the promotion work. The capitalists did not actively find ways to solve the difficulties in tools and equipment in the promotion work, which seriously affected the development of the promotion work. So far, the Juji Yarn Factory has not cultivated a worker who can master the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. When the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau No. 1 Factory began to promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the leading cadres also did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of this new work method. Therefore, when they were busy clearing up assets and preparing to implement the new wage system, they neglected the promotion of this new work method. The various tools needed for the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method were planned to be made on September 20, but only ten boards and two brooms were made by October 10. This caused the promotion work to take a detour. Because the education on the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was not carried out enough during the promotion, 20% of the "Hao Jianxiu workers" still cannot connect the actions of changing roving and wringing the leather ring. The workers said: "We have learned the actions, but we can't explain the principles." The propaganda and education work of the Dahua Yarn Factory has also not been done enough. A few backward elements attacked the little teachers, saying: "Eating, supervising workers, what's so great about it!" Although some workers have become Hao Jianxiu workers, some parts of their operation are still their old ways of doing things. In addition, some factories did not coordinate the pre-spinning and maintenance workers well during the promotion, resulting in problems such as large spindle vibration, bobbin jumps, pre-spinning roving spinning single heads, and rotten yarn, which caused difficulties for the fine yarn workers in the operation and increased the number of roller lappings. After discovering these problems during the inspection, the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau and the Northwest Region Committee of the Textile Trade Union have suggested that all factories immediately establish inspection teams to inspect and correct the deviations occurring in the promotion process, so that every fine yarn worker can learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and create more wealth for the country.

    在推广郝建秀工作法中我们为什么走了弯路
    国营天津第一棉纺织厂副厂长  张振华
    国营天津第一棉纺织厂在推广郝建秀工作法时走了弯路。这主要是因为我们的领导思想上有严重的错误。人民日报对我们的批评是完全正确的。
    最近，我们已召开了二次干部会议检查思想，召开了细纱工人大会进行总结和检讨，同时整顿和加强了推广工作的组织领导。经过深刻的检讨，我们已初步扭转了干部中的保守思想和自满情绪，群众情绪已经高涨起来了。参加学习的细纱工人，皮辊花率已较推广前下降了百分之三到百分之十四，平均看六百锭出皮辊花百分之零点二九。出皮辊花最少的康德珍，看一千锭（三十二支纱）出皮辊花百分之零点二九。产量也提高了。工人的看车能力已由五百锭增加到六百锭。在质量方面，坏纱减少了百分之四十以上，断头率也显著减少。现在，不只是细纱工人，就是落纱工也在积极地学习郝建秀工作法。
    错误的思想根源
    我厂推广郝建秀工作法为什么会走了弯路呢？这主要是领导方面有盲目的自满情绪和保守思想。这些思想是有它的社会思想根源和物质基础的。
    第一、对于细纱当车工的工作法，过去我们厂里有一种错误的看法：“一切服从接头，一切围绕接头；只要接头快，接头好，就是好工作法。”在这种理论指导下，就只有使工人拚命接头，号召工人在操作中做到“三勤三快”。这实际上是促使工人无限度地增加劳动强度，使机器把工人管制起来。这实质上是资产阶级的技术观点。郝建秀工作法和这是完全不同的。它的基本特点是工人掌握机器，因而操作有规律，合理化，并能减轻劳动强度。在我们社会主义性质的国营企业中，旧的技术观点还没有进行彻底清算，推广郝建秀工作法就不可能不经过思想斗争和实践教育。我厂在开始推广时，我们没有组织干部很好地学习、讨论郝建秀工作法。所以，大家对于郝建秀工作法只是盲目崇拜。所谓推广，也只是从形式上追求郝建秀工作法的某些动作，让工人机械地去模仿。这样工人当然就不可能掌握郝建秀工作法的基本精神，推广工作也就不可能收到预期的效果。推广工作中发生了问题，大家就失掉信心，而不能仔细地进行分析，努力克服困难。这时，在技术上的旧观点，就又占了主导的地位，有些人甚至反对有规律地巡回，怀疑“以接头为主”的作法，可能并不是不对的。
    第二、和上一问题相联系的，是我厂的领导干部和一般干部有严重的保守思想和自满情绪。我厂细纱的皮辊花率是比较低的。全厂平均百分之零点五。细纱工人孟淑媛的皮辊花率有一个时期比郝建秀还要低些。九月份推广孟淑媛工作法和郭瓦廖夫工作法后，又降到百分之零点三三，最低达到百分之零点一三。这种成绩，是和本厂的机器条件、前纺情况等有关系的。有些干部没有看到这一点，竟因此骄傲起来。在这种思想基础上，有些干部对推广郝建秀工作法就抱了怀疑态度。他们怀疑“在一厂推广郝建秀工作法是不是能再减低皮辊花”。当推广初期，皮辊花没有下降反而上升时，在有些干部中就又产生了“一厂皮辊花可能不会再减少了”，“郝建秀工作法不如孟淑媛的工作法好”等错误论调。这是使推广工作遭受损失的第二个原因。
    第三、一切先进经验的总结和推广，都是政治和技术的结合。没有马克思列宁主义的思想基础就不可能产生科学的操作方法。因之，推行先进工作法，必须进行思想斗争。我厂的领导干部对这个问题的认识是不明确的。在推广前，我厂没有进行深入的思想动员和教育工作，对落后的保守思想没有进行批判。当时领导方面错误地把推广郝建秀工作法当作一个纯技术性的问题，以为自己不懂技术不好领导，就把推广工作推给少数技术干部，因而没有依靠群众，发动群众。这是推广工作失败的主要原因，也是一个严重的教训。
    皮辊花为什么不能降低
    我们揭发、批判了发生偏向的思想根源以后，就开始深入车间进行测定，寻找皮辊花不能降低的原因。在检查中我们发现了以下两个问题：
    （一）要降低皮辊花率必须缩短放花时间。放花时间（就是从断头到接头中间所消耗的时间）长，是白花多的主要原因之一。放花时间为什么长呢？我们发现：首先是工人的巡回时间不平衡，忽长忽短。有的工人巡回一次最短用一分半钟，最长用十分五十五秒，平均四分半钟，也即是说断头后放花时间由一分半到十分五十五秒，这样皮辊花当然很多。其次，巡回过程中操作没有计划。如有的工人最多的时候做十三项工作，最少的时候只打一次擦板。工人作清洁工作的分量轻重也不一样，这也延长了断头后的放花时间。
    （二）要降低皮辊花必须减少断头。断头率的增减不完全是细纱当车工的力量所能决定的，必须各方面来配合。如温湿度的调节、纺出格林的轻重、配花成份的好坏、粗纱品质的高低、纱管好坏等，都直接影响断头的多少。在测定中，我们发现：一落纱的中间断头率也不一样：中纱断头最少、大纱次之、小纱最多。因此，当车工更应注意防止小纱断头。当车工的清洁工作作得不好，操作不熟练，也是断头多的重要原因。这些情况说明不是我厂的皮辊花不能减少，更不是郝建秀工作法不好，而是我们没有正确地推广郝建秀工作法。
    在测定中找出了皮辊花不能降低的原因后，我们就在工人中进行教育，并让小先生再上车实习，从实习中继续修正错误。实习的结果，皮辊花率下降了，工人的看车能力提高了，领导方面的自满情绪和保守思想再没有市场了。群众中的怀疑抵抗情绪也消除了，大家迫切要求学习郝建秀工作法。现在我们正在全面地推广郝建秀工作法。
    西北区重点检查郝建秀工作法推广工作
    有些纱厂对推广工作还不重视，使它不能顺利进行
    西北纺织管理局和中国纺织工会西北区委员会两单位，最近检查了西北纺织管理局第一厂、西安大华纱厂、新西北纱厂和渭南聚记纱厂推广郝建秀工作法的情况。检查结果证明：郝建秀工作法的推广工作已有很大成绩，各厂学会郝建秀工作法的工人皮辊花率一般都降低了百分之三十到四十。西北纺织管理局第一厂现在已有百分之七十以上的细纱工人成为郝建秀工作者。其他车间的工人运用了郝建秀工作法的基本精神，也做出了显著的成绩。大华纱厂工人杜云龙等运用郝建秀工作法的精神织布，每台布机十小时织布四十五码八，创造了这个厂的最高纪录。西北纺织管理局第一厂工人龙飞运用郝建秀工作法摇纱，产量也提高了四分之一以上。
    但是，也还有一些纱厂的领导干部和私营纱厂的资方对于推广工作不够重视，使推广工作不能顺利开展。像私营渭南聚记纱厂的资方，就对郝建秀工作法的意义认识不足；他们不允许出席细纱会议的代表脱离生产，以致推广工作没人负责。对推广工作中工具设备上的困难，资方不积极设法解决，严重地影响了推广工作的开展。到目前为止，聚记纱厂没有培养出一个能掌握郝建秀工作法的工作者。西北纺织管理局第一厂开始推广郝建秀工作法时，领导干部对这个新工作法的重要性也是认识不足的。因此，他们在忙于清理资产和准备实行新工资制度的工作的时候，就忽视了这新工作法的推广工作。推广郝建秀工作法需要的各种工具，在九月二十日就计划做，但是直到十月十日才做出十个擦板，两把扫帚。这就使推广工作走了一段弯路。因为在推广中关于郝建秀工作法的基本精神的教育进行得不够，所以有百分之二十的“郝建秀工作者”还不能把换粗纱、绞皮圈等动作连系起来进行。工人们说：“动作学会啦，道理可说不上。”大华纱厂的宣传教育工作也做得不够。少数落后分子打击小先生说：“吃吃饭，监监工，有啥了不起！”有些工人虽然已成了郝建秀工作者，操作中有些部分仍是自己老一套的作法。此外，有的厂在推广中前纺和保全工没有配合好，以致发生锭子震动大、筒管蹦、前纺粗纱纺单头、烂纱等毛病，造成细纱工在操作中的困难，增加了皮辊花的出数。西北纺织管理局和纺织工会西北区委员会在检查中发现了这些问题以后，已经建议各厂立即成立检查组，检查和纠正推广过程中发生的偏差，使每一个细纱工人都能学会郝建秀工作法，为国家创造更多的财富。
