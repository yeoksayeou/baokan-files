    The Li Liangxiao newspaper reading group in Wudong County, Suiyuan Province, is one of the most outstanding newspaper reading groups in rural Suiyuan. This reading group has fully played its role in providing political leadership and ideological education to the people in movements such as anti-hegemony rent reduction, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resistance against America and aiding Korea. The advanced experience of this reading group has promoted the rural newspaper reading groups throughout the province, making them active and consolidated as well.
    The current political and production movements are
    the main content of the reading group's study and propaganda
    The characteristic of Li Liangxiao's leadership of the reading group is to take the current political and production movements as the main content of the reading group's study, propaganda, and activities. During the spring plowing this year, they actively responded to the government's call to increase grain production and organized labor mutual aid. They understood from reading the newspaper that organizing labor mutual aid was the key to increasing production, so they further studied the relevant materials on labor mutual aid, and the group members all realized the benefits of "getting organized." At this time, Li Liangxiao combined five farmers who had confidence in the mutual aid group and formed a labor mutual aid experimental group. The excellent achievements of this mutual aid group quickly spread. In the same quarter, thirteen labor mutual aid groups were developed in this natural village.
    Li Liangxiao's newspaper reading group promoted newspaper
    group activities and production work throughout the province
    March is the season when spring plowing begins. How to enable the newspaper reading group to persevere during spring plowing production and better play its role in production is a common problem for rural newspaper reading groups. Li Liangxiao seized this central link and mobilized everyone to discuss it. As a result, everyone unanimously believed: "Even if we are busier, we can still find time to read the newspaper!" Everyone unanimously decided: read the newspaper for half an hour every night, and the newspaper reading group members should use production to publicize major events in the newspaper to the masses at any time. The newspaper reading group played a leading role in production, such as taking the lead in organizing labor mutual aid groups to overcome the difficulties of insufficient manpower and animal power; striving to cultivate twenty more hectares of land this year than last year; and harrowing various crops more times. In early April this year, they used these conditions to challenge the province's newspaper reading groups through the Suiyuan Daily. The Suiyuan Daily received more than 700 letters of challenge from newspaper reading groups from all over the province. It is conceivable how huge a role Li Liangxiao's newspaper reading group played in promoting the activities of newspaper reading groups throughout the province and promoting production work!
    At present, Suiyuan has begun land reform. Some farmers cannot understand the problem from a class relationship perspective for a while. Regarding their poverty, they either sigh about being "poor from the womb" or say "it's my fate." The members of Li Liangxiao's newspaper reading group believed that this statement was wrong, so they helped everyone dig up the "roots of poverty" and improve their class consciousness anytime and anywhere. For example, the farmer Zhang Sankou said: "How do you dig up the roots of poverty? My family of seven used to rent land, and as a result, we couldn't eat or dress..." Li Liangxiao asked him: "What about now?" He said: "Now it's great, all the grain I grow belongs to me. The amount of grain handed over to the government is also limited, and there are reductions and exemptions in the event of disasters. It's really good!" Li Liangxiao said: "That's right, the roots of poverty are here. Why were you poor before liberation? Wasn't it because the landlords took away the grain you worked so hard to harvest! The roots of poverty are on the landlords. Overthrowing the landlords will eradicate the roots of poverty." Then, he enlightened everyone to discuss the question of "who feeds whom," and the discussion became more and more enthusiastic. Their vivid propaganda was very effective. Many farmers said: "Poverty is not fate. This time, when land reform is implemented, we have to settle accounts with the landlords!"
    Li Liangxiao's newspaper reading group often reflects to the newspaper

    李亮小怎样从政治上思想上领导他的读报组
    绥远武东县李亮小读报组，是绥远农村中一个最出色的读报小组。这个读报组在反霸减租、镇压反革命、抗美援朝等运动中，充分地发挥了对于人民群众实行政治领导和思想教育的作用。这个读报组的先进经验，推动了全省的农村读报组，使这些读报组也活跃和巩固起来。
    当前的政治运动和生产运动是
    读报组学习和宣传的主要内容
    李亮小领导读报组的特点是，把当前正在进行的政治运动、生产运动作为读报组学习、宣传和活动的主要内容。在今年春耕时，他们积极响应政府增产粮食的号召，组织了劳动互助。他们从读报中懂得了组织变工互助，是增加生产的关键，于是就进一步学习有关劳动互助的材料，组员们都认识到“组织起来”的好处。这时，李亮小结合了五个对互助组有信心的农民，成立了一个变工互助试验小组。这个互助组的优良的成绩，很快就传开了。在同一季度里，这个自然村中发展了十三个变工互助组。

    组活动和生产工作
    三月是春耕开始的季节。怎样使读报组在春耕生产中坚持下来，并且能更好地在生产上发挥作用，这是农村读报组普遍存在的问题。李亮小抓住了这个中心环节，发动大家讨论，结果一致认为：“再忙些，也可以抽出时间来读报呵！”大家一致议决：每天晚上读报半小时，读报组员要通过生产，随时向群众宣传报上的重大事件。读报组在生产上起了领导作用，如，带头组织变工互助组，克服人力畜力过少的困难；争取全村今年比去年多种地二十顷；并把各种作物多耙耱一遍。在今年四月初，他们用这些条件，通过绥远日报，向全省读报组提出挑战。绥远日报前后共收到各地读报组的应战书达七百多封。可以想到，李亮小读报组在推动全省读报组的活动，推动生产工作中，起了多么巨大的作用！
    目前，绥远开始进行土地改革，有些农民，一时不能从阶级关系上来认识问题，他们对于自己的贫困，不是叹“胎里穷”，就是说“命里苦”。李亮小读报组的组员们认定了这种说法是错误的，就随时随地帮助大家挖“穷根”，提高阶级觉悟。像农民张三扣说：“穷根怎样挖呢？我全家七口人，过去租地种，结果是吃不上穿不上……”李亮小就问他：“现在呢？”他说：“现在可好了，种的粮食都归我。交公粮也有限，受灾还给减免，实在好！”李亮小说：“对啦，穷根就在这儿，解放前你为什么穷？还不是地主把你辛辛苦苦打下的粮食拿走了！穷根就在地主身上。打倒地主就挖掉了穷根。”接着，他又启发大家讨论“谁养活的谁”的问题，讨论是越来越起劲。他们这种活生生的宣传，收效很大。许多农民都说：“人穷不是命，这回实行土地改革，可得跟地主好好算一算！”
