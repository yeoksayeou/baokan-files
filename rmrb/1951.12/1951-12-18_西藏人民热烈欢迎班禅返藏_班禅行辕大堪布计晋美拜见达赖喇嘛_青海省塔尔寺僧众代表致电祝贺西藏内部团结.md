Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 17th: The news of the Panchen Erdeni's impending return to Tibet and the arrival of all officials of the Panchen Lama's Khenpo Conference Hall in Lhasa has greatly inspired the monks and laypeople of Tibet. The people and monastic and secular officials of Shigatse in 后藏(Later Tibet), as well as all the lamas of the 札什伦布寺(Tashilhunpo Monastery), the Panchen Lama's residence, immediately selected representatives to go to Lhasa to pay their respects and present gifts to Chief Khenpo Jigmey and Ngawang Jinpa of the Panchen Lama's Office. They wrote to Jigmey and Ngawang Jinpa, saying: "Hearing the joyous news of the Panchen Lama's imminent return to Tibet, and that you have safely arrived in Lhasa to represent the Lama in conveying greetings to the people of 后藏(Later Tibet), fills us with overwhelming joy. It is the greatest honor we, the monks, laypeople, and officials, have ever had that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, are closely united to seek happiness for all the people of Tibet!"

Currently, the Tibetan people are actively preparing to welcome the Panchen Erdeni. The Tibetan local government and major monasteries are also collecting historical materials related to the meetings between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama from past generations to formulate welcome protocols. At the same time, they are dispatching monastic and secular officials to welcome him from afar.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 17th: Chief Khenpo Jigmey of the Panchen Lama's Office, representing the Panchen Erdeni, led more than 200 Tibetan cadres who had arrived in Lhasa on the morning of the 4th to pay their respects to the Dalai Lama at Norbulingka. The Dalai Lama extended his warm greetings to Jigmey and others, personally accepting the gifts sent by the Panchen Erdeni, a recent photograph of the Panchen Erdeni, and a letter in his own handwriting, expressing his infinite delight. Before receiving Jigmey, the Dalai Lama had sent 机巧堪布(Chikyab Khenpo) Ngawang Langji, chief Kalon Lhalu Tsewang Dorje of the Tibetan local government, and many monastic and secular officials to hold a reception tea party. The tea party was filled with an atmosphere of unity and joy, and everyone unanimously praised: "Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni have returned to harmony, which is the happiness of the monastic and secular officials and all the Tibetan monks and laypeople."

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 17th: On the eve of the Panchen Erdeni's departure from Qinghai to return to Tibet, 察汉诺门汉佛(Chahan Nuomenhan Buddha), 赛多诺门汉佛(Saiduo Nuomenhan Buddha), 米纳佛(Mina Buddha), and 哈里哈佛(Haliha Buddha), representing the three thousand monks of 塔尔寺(Ta'er Monastery) in Qinghai Province, sent a telegram to the Dalai Buddha, the Panchen Erdeni, etc. The telegram read: "To the Dalai Buddha, the Panchen Erdeni, 冈丹寺池巴(Ganden Tripa) and all the monks of the three major monasteries in Lhasa and the 札什伦布寺(Tashilhunpo Monastery):

"We Tibetan monks and laypeople have long suffered from the aggression and oppression of imperialism and the incitement of the Kuomintang reactionary government, which has caused disunity between the Tibetan nationality and other fraternal nationalities in the country. Since the liberation of the whole country, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the leaders of all our ethnic groups, a new situation of peaceful liberation of Tibet has been promoted, which has united our nation internally. The Panchen Erdeni's glorious return to his homeland is another great happy event following the liberation of Tibet. The three thousand monks of 塔尔寺(Ta'er Monastery) are overjoyed and, in addition to thanking the Central People's Government and the great leader Chairman Mao, congratulate the Dalai Buddha and the Panchen Erdeni on their close unity in the future under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, strengthening the internal unity of Tibet and the unity between the various fraternal nationalities in the country, thoroughly implementing the peaceful agreement on the liberation of Tibet, expelling imperialist forces of aggression in Tibet, consolidating the southwest national defense of the motherland, and building a new Tibet."
