    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government convened a mobilization meeting on December 18th against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Director Kong Yuan of the General Administration of Customs delivered a mobilization report at the meeting. After explaining the great significance of opposing corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Director Kong Yuan proposed: The General Administration recently convened a national customs cargo management and inspection work conference to study the role that customs work should play in the current production increase and economy practice campaign. It was decided that, starting in 1952, national customs would strive to increase production and practice economy by one trillion yuan for the country by strictly implementing foreign trade control policies, investigating and prohibiting smuggling and tax evasion, preventing foreign exchange flight and speculation, accelerating cargo transportation, eliminating waste and loss in material circulation, and overcoming blindness and phenomena unfavorable to the overall situation in import and export trade. Director Kong Yuan said: To accomplish this major political task, we must first oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Carrying out this campaign in the customs has even deeper and more important significance. As everyone knows, before liberation, in the old customs under the long-term rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, corruption was rampant under the dominance of bourgeois ideology. For example, before liberation, the number of corrupt personnel in Guangzhou Customs accounted for 92% of the total number of personnel in the customs. After more than two years of ideological education since liberation, and after repeatedly calling for confession and exposure and punishing a group of corrupt elements, this phenomenon has changed, but corruption is still serious. For example, Bian Dingsun, the temporarily transferred Director Secretary of the Tariff Commission of the General Administration of Customs, used his position to privately leak tariff secrets to Hong Kong merchants before the new customs tariff was announced. In addition, there is the phenomenon of collective corruption, such as the collective corruption of more than ten million yuan in the Shatou Branch of Fuzhou Customs. The waste phenomenon of giving gifts and treating guests and abusing public funds is even more serious. When the General Administration of Customs convened a customs affairs meeting, many customs sent cigarettes and fruits to the General Administration, and the General Administration accepted them without criticism or inspection. The General Administration built an auditorium, but due to the irresponsibility of the engineering planning personnel and the failure of the leadership to promptly inspect and deal with it, the time was delayed, and the cost of materials rose, wasting more than 500 million yuan. I want to conduct a review in these areas. Director Kong Yuan emphasized: The people's customs can never allow these phenomena to continue to exist. Leaders at all levels must personally take action, fully promote democracy, and vigorously launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, calling on everyone to confess and expose, and oppose liberalism and a passive attitude.
    In order to strengthen leadership over this campaign, the General Administration of Customs has established an economy practice inspection committee, with Director Kong Yuan as the chairman, and has stipulated the time and specific plans for carrying out this campaign.

    海关总署开会动员反对贪污浪费
    孔原署长号召全国海关明年增产节约一万亿元
    【本报讯】中央人民政府海关总署在十八日召开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义动员大会，由海关总署孔原署长在会上作动员报告。孔原署长在说明了反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的巨大意义以后，提出：总署最近召开全国海关货管、验征工作会议，研究了海关工作在当前增产节约运动中应起的作用，决定从一九五二年起，全国海关要从严格执行对外贸易管制政策，查禁走私漏税，防止逃汇套汇，加速货运，消除物资流转中的浪费损耗，克服进出口贸易中的盲目性和不利于全局的现象等方面，为国家增产节约一万亿元。孔原署长说：要完成这个重大的政治任务，首先就必须反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义。在海关中开展这一运动，是具有更深刻、更重要的意义的。大家都知道，解放前在帝国主义和国民党反动派长期统治下的旧海关人员中，在资产阶级的思想支配下，贪污成风。如广州海关解放前贪污的人数占该海关总人数百分之九十二。解放后，经过两年多的思想教育，经过多次号召坦白检举并惩办了一批贪污分子，这种现象虽已有了转变，但贪污现象仍然严重。如海关总署暂调税则委员会主任秘书卞鼎孙在海关新税则没有公布前，就利用职权，私自把税则机密泄露给香港商人。此外，集体贪污现象，如福州海关?头支关集体贪污达一千余万元。送礼请客滥用公家经费等浪费现象更是严重的。海关总署召开关务会议，许多海关送香烟水果等给总署，总署没有加以批评检查就收下来了。总署修建礼堂，因工程计划人员不负责任，领导上未能及时检查处理，致延误时间，工料上涨浪费了五亿余元。在这些方面，我要进行检讨。孔原署长着重指出：人民海关是决不能允许这些现象继续存在的，各级领导干部必须亲自动手，充分发扬民主，大张旗鼓地开展反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动，号召大家坦白检举，反对自由主义消极态度。
    海关总署为了加强对这一运动的领导，已成立节约检查委员会，由孔原署长任主任委员，并规定了开展这个运动的时间与具体计划。
