    The anti-corruption movement in Shenyang began on July 21st. From July 21st to August 6th, the main focus of each organization was anti-corruption education. Through reports from leading cadres, studying documents, and organizing discussions, a period of deliberation took place. Over 20,000 people citywide participated in the study and listened to mobilization reports. During the study, the erroneous view that "this unit is not a financial department, so there will be no corruption" was criticized, and the incorrect opinions of some leading cadres, such as "anti-corruption should only target lower-level personnel, and cadres should be dealt with during party rectification," and "anti-corruption should start from the Puppet Manchukuo period," were corrected. By around August 10th, most units in the city had completed their studies and entered the stage of confession and denunciation.

    The experience of Shenyang City proves that repeatedly clarifying the policies and methods of anti-corruption, and conscientiously implementing them in practice, is a vital guarantee for the smooth progress and positive results of the anti-corruption movement. Because corrupt behavior has its historical roots and social basis, to eradicate this bad behavior and prevent corruption from existing in the new society, it is necessary to mobilize the anti-corruption enthusiasm of the vast majority of staff, enabling them to understand the harm of corruption to the revolutionary cause, and thus resolutely struggle against corrupt phenomena. The methods of mobilizing the masses include education, calling on corrupt elements to confess voluntarily, and urging the masses to denounce. It is necessary to explain to corrupt elements that as long as they confess truthfully and thoroughly, those with serious offenses will have their punishment reduced, and those with minor offenses will be exempted from punishment. However, corrupt elements generally have concerns about confessing their corrupt behavior, which must be broken down, otherwise it will be difficult for them to confess voluntarily. The method of breaking down concerns is to repeatedly clarify the policies: explain them during meetings, explain them during individual talks, ensuring they understand that the Party and the government welcome their confession, and that thorough confession is the only bright path to escape the mire and reform. Those who confess thoroughly will be treated leniently by the Party and the government. Those who refuse to confess will be seen as having no intention of repentance, and the government will severely punish them after they are denounced.

    Through repeated policy explanations, mobilization, and reports, corrupt elements confessed one after another. From few to many, from small to large, from ordinary staff to relatively responsible cadres, a widespread movement took shape.

    Ninety percent of the facts of corruption were exposed through confession. General issues were confessed in group meetings; more serious issues were confessed in writing or through individual talks with leading cadres. Typical cases were reported voluntarily in typical confession reports. These confession reports had a great enlightening effect on others.

    As the movement develops to the later stage, it must shift to denunciation as the main method. Because after the mobilization and confession movement, most corrupt elements with relatively minor offenses have confessed. Only those with serious corruption and some relatively responsible cadres who have engaged in corruption are unwilling to confess voluntarily, so denunciation must be adopted. Some major cases exposed in Shenyang City, such as corruption cases involving individual section chiefs, managers, and even bureau chiefs, were all denounced. But in general, denouncers have concerns beforehand. It is therefore necessary to educate the masses, repeatedly clarify policies, and explain that every revolutionary worker must resolutely safeguard revolutionary interests. As long as it is not a false accusation, the Party and the government will resolutely support all denouncers. If the denounced dare to retaliate, they will be subject to increased punishment. It should also be explained that denouncing corrupt elements is not only to protect the interests of the country but also to save those who have fallen into the mire. Explain that anyone has the right to denounce and can denounce anyone.

    When using denunciation as the main method, it must be combined with the mobilization of confession to expose the truth of the case more thoroughly and accurately. This method is particularly effective for corrupt elements who are highly suspected, lack sufficient evidence, but are relatively easy to break through. When using this method, the main leading cadres of the unit should personally talk to important corrupt officials, explain the policies more clearly, analyze the pros and cons, and break down their concerns. This often makes corrupt elements confess more thoroughly and actively denounce others.

    In addition, the most effective way to break down all kinds of concerns is for leading cadres to promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism and conscientiously review their own bureaucracy in their work. Only when leaders can make profound self-criticism can they inspire everyone's enthusiasm for confession and denunciation, and can the anti-corruption movement be rapidly launched.

    The corrupt behaviors exposed in the anti-corruption movement in Shenyang City can be roughly divided into the following categories:

    First: Perverting justice for bribes, accepting bribes. Generally, it goes from small to large, from internal to external. It starts with accepting invitations to dinner from private merchants and bad elements, borrowing money from them, and then conspiring to embezzle. As a result, they shield and hide drug dealers, fugitive landlords, tax evaders, current criminals, or people of unknown origin, completely losing their position. Some have sold substandard buildings and processed products of private industrial and commercial operators to the state without inspection. Others have leaked confidential price information, causing losses to the state. Some act as de facto second landlords, coercing the masses and profiting from it.

    Second: Continuing the bad habits of the old society, practicing semi-public corruption. For example, repairing cars requires a 20-30% kickback (this phenomenon has been discovered in the Shenyang Municipal Government Automobile Team. It is said to be widespread. If the repair factory does not give kickbacks to the car drivers, the drivers will deliberately damage the car during the warranty period, which the repair factory cannot afford). Some cadres accept gifts from private merchants and bad elements during weddings and funerals, birthdays, childbirth, and baby showers.

    Third: Stealing public property or embezzling public funds and property. The grain company once lost eleven bags of rice. The director and deputy director of the second warehouse of the department store sold various items worth more than 15 million yuan (RMB); a technician and administrator of the general affairs section stole and sold various items worth 10.058 million yuan (RMB) from May of last year to July of this year.

    Fourth: Occupying public funds and property, engaging in speculation and profiteering to enrich oneself. Individual cadres borrowed public funds for dozens of days to conduct capital "turnover," with some using more than 600 million Northeast currency. A certain purchasing agent once made a profit of more than 4.8 million yuan (RMB) through speculation. The Industry and Commerce Bureau claimed to have used 2.3 billion (Northeast currency) of public funds as a foundation for its "small family fortune" for three years, earning more than 4 billion (Northeast currency). Various professional companies have dozens of billions (Northeast currency) in "family fortunes" called "welfare funds," which are spent at will. Although this is of a localist nature, it is also illegal.

    Fifth: Extortion. When evicting people from houses, trading livestock, inspecting sanitation, constructing, paying taxes, or handling other procedures, they harass or threaten the masses to achieve the purpose of extortion. Disguised extortion includes borrowing money, grain, and coal without repayment, and eating in restaurants without paying. Some public security officers have not paid for meals for two years. Some public security officers have never paid for a haircut from the Puppet Manchukuo era to the present.

    The reasons for the occurrence of corruption are mainly that the political awareness of some cadres is low, and after entering the city, they cannot withstand the erosion of the corrupt practices left over from the old society, thus falling into the mire of corruption. In addition, some people believe that the revolution has been victorious and they should enjoy it, which further promotes the development of corrupt behavior. Secondly, various agencies have been constantly expanding, with an increasing number of new personnel, but they have not been sufficiently educated or vetted. Some business departments have made the mistake of emphasizing business over politics in the use of cadres, thus neglecting to politically transform them, especially those old-style merchants. Some agencies have also not done enough in the vetting of new personnel. Among the corrupt elements who have confessed this time, some have been consistently addicted to opium, morphine, prostitution, and theft, but they have never been vetted or purged. Thirdly, lax or non-existent systems allow corrupt elements to take advantage. For example, leaking confidential price information is due to insufficient attention to confidentiality by relevant departments. When determining price changes (small changes), the Industry and Commerce Bureau did not strictly control the price division, allowing the price division to change or set prices without authorization. Substandard processed products are due to a lax acceptance system. The income from tram fares, water fees, and rent is often paid in full with invoices, with money collected piecemeal and settled at the end of the month, or not paid on the same day but on the next day, or collected by the housing administrator (who has no right to collect money). The general affairs section of the department store receives miscellaneous items from the processing department, such as cloth, only with the number of pieces, not the length. The native products company sometimes only has the number of heads of pigs, not the weight. These places are easily exploited by corrupt elements.

    The main experiences of the anti-corruption movement in Shenyang City are:

    First, the anti-corruption struggle is a long-term and regular struggle, not something that can be completely resolved in one or two movements. However, this struggle must form a movement in a certain period, launch a large-scale attack on corruption, and mobilize the masses to widely denounce and expose it. Although corruption has social roots, the severity of various corrupt phenomena still varies. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on key units to carry out confession and denunciation movements, while mainly conducting education in other units. Because anti-corruption is long-term, after a movement, it must shift to regular work and not stop. Cadres should continue to be educated, investigations and exposures should continue, and various systems should be discussed and established from bottom to top and from top to bottom to prevent and eliminate corruption. In addition, there must be regular mass supervision. This supervision should also be achieved on the basis of continuous education. Representative conferences, seminars, and daily education are effective methods to improve the role of mass supervision.

    Second, to carry out the anti-corruption movement well, the following issues must be resolved:

    (1) Through study, everyone must recognize that corruption is shameful and have the determination to fight against it. This is the foundation for making anti-corruption a mass, conscious movement.

    (2) Clearly defining the boundaries of corruption and explaining the policies and handling methods of anti-corruption can break down concerns, promote the voluntary confession of corrupt elements, and widely mobilize the masses to denounce.

    (3) Leaders must support and cadres must take the lead. Many people have concerns and look at the attitude of leaders. If the attitude of leaders is firm and cadres can take the lead, then confession and denunciation movements will be easily launched.

    Third, in the anti-corruption struggle, leaders must not only make the movement a widespread mass movement but also focus their main energy on investigating major cases at a certain time. When the anti-corruption struggle has just begun, the emphasis should be on breaking down mass concerns and organizing the masses into confession and denunciation movements. When the movement has been launched and major cases have been discovered, the leadership should use its main strength to investigate these major cases. Only in this way can the anti-corruption struggle be deepened. Larger cases must be handled seriously and conscientiously. Those with bad character, incorrigible corruption, and incorrigibility should be resolutely purged.

    沈阳市的反贪污运动
    本报综合稿
    沈阳市的反贪污运动是从七月二十一日开始的。从七月二十一日到八月六日，各机关主要是进行反贪污的学习。通过首长报告，学习文件，组织讨论，进行了酝酿。全市参加学习和听到动员报告的有二万多人。在学习中，批判了“本单位不是财经部门，不会有贪污现象”的错误观点，纠正了某些领导干部所提“反贪污只反下级人员，干部留到整党时再说”的错误意见，纠正了“反贪污要从伪满时期算起”的错误作法。到八月十日前后，全市一般的单位都结束了学习。接着进入了坦白、检举阶段。
    沈阳市的经验证明：反复讲清反贪污的政策和方法，并在工作中认真贯彻执行，是使反贪污运动顺利进展并获得良好效果的重要保证。由于贪污行为有它的历史根源和社会基础，所以要根除这种恶劣的行为，使贪污在新社会中不能存在，就必须发动广大工作人员的反贪污积极性，使他们从思想上认识贪污行为对革命事业的危害，从而对贪污现象进行坚决的斗争。发动群众的方法，除进行教育外，就是号召贪污分子自动坦白，和号召群众检举。要向贪污分子说明：只要坦白得真实、彻底，重者减轻处分，轻者免予处分。但是，贪污分子对于坦白自己的贪污行为，一般的是有顾虑的，必须设法打破，否则他们就很难自动坦白。打破顾虑的方法是反复讲清政策：开会的时候讲，个别谈话的时候讲，务使他们懂得党和政府欢迎他们坦白，彻底坦白是跳出泥坑、改过自新的唯一光明道路。凡是彻底坦白的人，党和政府一定从宽处理。不肯坦白的人，就表示他们毫无悔改的意思，被检举出来以后，政府一定从严处理。
    经过反复地解释政策、动员、报告，贪污分子纷纷坦白。由少而多，由小到大，由普通工作人员到比较负责干部，形成了广泛的运动。
    百分之九十的贪污事实，是用坦白的方法揭发出来的。其中属于一般问题的，在小组会上坦白；较重大的，用书面坦白，或找首长个别谈话。典型的，则在自愿原则下进行典型坦白报告。这种坦白报告，对其他人的启发作用很大。
    运动发展到后期，必须转为以检举为主。因为经过动员和坦白运动，一般情节较轻的贪污分子，大体都坦白了。只有那些有严重贪污行为的人，和有贪污行为的某些比较负责的干部，还不肯自动坦白，就必须采用检举的方法。沈阳市所揭发的一些重大的案件，如个别科长、经理以至局长的贪污案件，都是检举出来的。但一般地说，检举者在事先是有顾虑的。这就必须向群众进行教育，反复讲清政策，说明每一个革命工作人员必须坚决维护革命利益。只要不是诬陷，党和政府坚决给一切检举者撑腰。如果被检举者敢于报复，一定要受到加重的处分。并应说明，检举贪污分子不但是为了保护国家的利益，也是为了挽救陷入泥坑的人。说明任何人都有检举权利，并且可以检举一切人。
    运用以检举为主的方法时，又必须和发动坦白相结合，才能使案情暴露得更加彻底和真实。这种方法用于嫌疑重大、材料不多但较容易突破的贪污分子，特别有效。运用这个方法时，对于重要贪污犯，本单位的主要领导干部应亲自和他谈话，更清楚地解释政策，分析利害，打破他的顾虑。这样往往使贪污分子坦白得更彻底，并能积极检举其他人。
    另外，打破各种顾虑的最有效办法，是领导干部发扬批评和自我批评的精神，认真检讨自己在工作中的官僚主义。只有领导者能作深刻的自我检讨，才能启发大家坦白和检举的积极性，才能使反贪污运动迅速展开。
    沈阳市反贪污运动中所暴露出来的贪污行为，大概有下列几种：
    第一种：贪赃枉法，接受贿赂。一般的都是由小到大，由内到外。开始是接受私商、坏分子请吃饭，向他们借钱，然后合谋贪污。因此就包庇和隐藏毒贩、逃亡地主、漏税户、现行犯、或来历不明的人，完全丧失了立场。也有把私营工商业者的不合规格的建筑物、加工品免受检查卖给国家的。还有偷漏物价机密，使国家遭受损失的。也有代行二房东职权，迫胁群众、从中牟利的。
    第二种：沿袭旧社会的恶习，实行半公开的贪污。如修理汽车要回扣百分之二十至三十（沈阳市府汽车队已查出这种现象。据说这是带有普遍性的。修理工厂如不给汽车司机回扣，在保险期内司机故意把车弄坏，修理工厂就受不了）。有的干部在婚丧嫁娶，过生日，生男育女，孩子过满月时，就接受私商和坏分子的礼物。
    第三种：盗卖公物或窃取公款、公物。粮食公司曾一次丢失十一袋大米。百货公司第二仓库主任、副主任卖掉共价值一千五百多万元（人民币）的各种物品；总务股一个技工和管理员，从去年五月到今年七月，盗卖各种物品达人民币一千零五十八万元。
    第四种：占用公款公物，投机倒把，借以自肥。个别干部借公款几十天，进行资金“周转”，有用过六亿多东北币的。某采买员曾一次倒把获利四百八十多万人民币。工商局自称曾用公款二十三亿（东北币）为本单位“小家底”作基金达三年之久，获利四十多亿（东北币）。各专业公司都有“家底”数十亿（东北币），名为“福利基金”，随便开支。这虽属本位主义的性质，但也是违法的行为。
    第五种：敲诈勒索。在撵群众搬房子、牲口交易、检查卫生、修建、交税或办其他手续的时候，刁难群众或施以威胁，达到敲诈的目的。变相的敲诈如借钱、借粮、借煤不还，下饭馆吃饭不给钱等。有的公安员吃了两年饭都没给过钱。有的公安员从伪满时代到现在，理发从来没有出过一次钱。
    贪污现象发生的原因，主要是某些干部政治觉悟低，进城以后，经不起旧社会遗留下来的腐朽作风的侵袭，因而堕落到贪污腐化的泥坑。再加上有些人认为革命胜利了，应该享受了，就更助长了贪污行为的发展。其次是各种机关不断扩大，新人员增多，但对他们教育不够，审查不够。有些企业部门在使用干部方面，有重业务轻政治的错误观点，因而忽视从政治上改造他们，特别是对那些旧式的商人。某些机关对新人员的审查工作也做得很不够。这次已经坦白的贪污分子中，有些是一贯吸大烟、扎吗啡、嫖妓女、偷东西的分子，但一直没有审查、清洗他们。第三是制度不严或没有制度，使贪污分子有机可乘。如泄漏物价机密，是由于有关部门注意保密不够。确定物价变动（小变动）时，工商局对物价股控制不严，使物价股得以擅自改价或订价。加工品不合格，是由于验收制度不严。电车费、水费、房租费的收入往往是整付发票、零收钱、月底结账，或当日不交次日交，或由房屋管理员收钱（他们无权收钱）。百货公司总务股收到剔庄部的零星东西，如布，只有块数，没有尺数。土产公司的猪，有时只有头数，没有斤数。这些地方，都容易被贪污分子钻空子。
    沈阳市反贪污运动的主要经验是：
    第一、反贪污斗争是一个长期的经常的斗争，而不是一朝一夕或一两个运动就可以彻底解决问题的。但这种斗争在一定时期必须形成运动，大张旗鼓地向贪污行为进攻，发动群众广泛检举、揭发。贪污行为虽有社会根源，但各种贪污现象的严重程度仍有不同。因而须要有重点地抓住主要单位开展坦白、检举运动，对其他单位则主要进行教育。正因为反贪污是长期的，因而在一个运动以后，须转入经常性的工作而不能停止。应当继续教育干部，继续调查揭发，并应立即从下而上、从上而下地讨论和订立各种制度，以防止和杜绝贪污。此外，还必须有群众性的经常监督。这种监督也应该是在不断地教育的基础上去实现。代表会、座谈会和日常的教育是提高群众监督作用的有效方法。
    第二、反贪污运动要开展得好，必须解决以下几个问题：
    （一）经过学习，使人人认识到贪污行为是可耻的，有和贪污现象作斗争的决心。这是使反贪污成为群众性的、自觉性的运动的基础。
    （二）明确划清贪污的界限，把反贪污的政策和处理方法讲解清楚，才能打破顾虑，促使贪污分子自觉坦白，广泛发动群众检举。
    （三）领导者撑腰，干部带头。许多人有顾虑，看领导者的态度。如果领导者的态度是坚决的，干部又能带头，那么坦白，检举运动就容易开展。
    第三、在反贪污斗争中，领导人员既须使运动成为广泛的群众运动，又要在一定时机把主要精力放在追查重大案件上。当反贪污斗争刚刚开始时，应着重于打破群众顾虑，把群众组织到坦白和检举运动中来。而当运动已经开展，重大案件已经发现以后，领导方面就要用主要力量追查这些重大案件。只有这样做，才能使反贪污斗争深入下去。对于较大的案件，必须严肃认真地处理。对那些品质恶劣、贪污成性的以及无可救药的分子，应坚决清洗出去。
