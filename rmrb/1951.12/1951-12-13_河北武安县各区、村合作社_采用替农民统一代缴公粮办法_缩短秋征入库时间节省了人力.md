    Cooperative Societies in Various Districts and Villages of Wu'an County, Hebei Province
    Adopt the Method of Uniformly Paying Public Grain on Behalf of Farmers
    Shortening the Time for Autumn Collection and Storage and Saving Labor
    Editor: During the autumn grain collection campaign, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, adopted the method of cooperative societies uniformly paying public grain on behalf of farmers, which is very popular among the masses. The district and village cooperative societies in this county collect cotton and other local products from the masses at a unified and reasonable price, and then the cooperative societies uniformly pay public grain on their behalf. This facilitates farmers storing cotton in the cooperative societies at any time, shortens the time for autumn collection and storage, and saves a large amount of labor, which is then invested in autumn plowing work. Before the start of the collection, farmers in Shangquan, Xiaquan, Xiguang and other villages in this county had already dried, picked, and stored about half of the cotton intended for public grain in the cooperative societies. After learning that the mountain farmers could not pay on time because the cotton was planted late and most of the cotton bolls had not yet opened, the cooperative societies reasonably collected walnuts, peppercorns and other local products from the farmers to pay public grain on their behalf. Therefore, the farmers were all moved and said, "Only the people's own cooperative societies can do these good things for the people!" Farmers in Jia Village and other villages also proposed "Pay public grain well, cultivate the land well, and win the anti-American and aid-Korea war early." They actively helped each other with plowing and launched the autumn plowing campaign.
    After the cooperative societies in Wu'an County adopted this method, the autumn grain collection work progressed very smoothly. As of now, more than 100 villages have completed their autumn grain collection tasks.

    河北武安县各区、村合作社
    采用替农民统一代缴公粮办法
    缩短秋征入库时间节省了人力
    编辑同志：河北省武安县在秋征运动中，采取了由合作社统一代缴公粮的办法，这个办法很受群众的拥护。这个县的区、村合作社，用统一、合理的价格向群众收来棉花和其他土产，然后由合作社统一代缴公粮。这样，便利了农民随时把棉花储存到合作社，又缩短了秋征入库时间，节省下大批劳动力，投入了秋耕工作。这个县的上泉、下泉、西广等村的农民，还在开征以前，就把约占公粮一半的棉花，晒干、拣净储存到合作社去。合作社了解山区农民因为棉花播种晚，棉铃大部还没开，不能及时缴纳的情况后，便合理地向农民转收核桃、花椒等土产，代替他们缴公粮。因此，农民都很感动地说：“只有人民自己的合作社，才能给人民办这些好事！”贾庄等村的农民并提出“缴好公粮耕好地，抗美援朝早胜利”。纷纷互助插犋，开展秋耕运动。
    武安县合作社采用这种办法后，使秋征工作开展的非常顺利，到目前为止，已有一百多个村全部完成了秋征任务。        王守民
