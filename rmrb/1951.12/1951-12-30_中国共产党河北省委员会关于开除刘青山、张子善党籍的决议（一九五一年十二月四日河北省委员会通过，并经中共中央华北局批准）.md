     Resolution of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on Expelling Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party
    (Adopted by the Hebei Provincial Committee on December 4, 1951, and Approved by the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee)
    Liu Qingshan, former Secretary of the Tianjin Local Committee, native of Anguo County, Hebei Province, born into a hired laborer's family, 35 years old, joined the Party in 1931. Zhang Zishan, current Secretary of the Tianjin Local Committee, former Commissioner of the Tianjin Special District, native of Shen County, Hebei Province, born into a student's family, 37 years old, joined the Party in 1933. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan have both participated in revolutionary struggles for about 20 years. Under the Kuomintang's bloody White Terror, in the arduous eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the more than three-year People's Liberation War, they both fought bravely for the cause of the Party and the liberation of the people, establishing merits. They could have continued to do more for the Party, the country, and the people. However, in the peaceful environment of more than two years after the national victory, they could not withstand the encroachment and temptation of the bourgeois selfish and self-interested ideology and lifestyle, and they degenerated. They have completely become unforgivable traitors to the Party, the country, and the people.

    Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, in order to satisfy their contemptible desire for improper personal enjoyment and their extremely corrupt lifestyle, relied on their positions and disregarded national laws and Party discipline, regardless of the people's suffering, stealing huge sums of money totaling 15.54954 billion yuan from airport construction funds, disaster relief grain, river management funds, relief grain for cadres' families, local grain, and exploiting and deducting migrant workers' wages, and fraudulently obtaining bank loans. They engaged in illegal business operations in the name of organizational production, and handed over 4.9 billion yuan to the奸商 (scheming merchant) Zhang Wenyi to speculate in steel and wood, disintegrating state-owned factories and mines, allowing him to engage in speculation and profiteering, disrupting finance, and causing losses to the people's property of more than 1.4 billion yuan.

    After obtaining illegal profits and engaging in large-scale embezzlement, Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, and others arbitrarily wasted and squandered money, leading a shameful and corrupt life. Liu Qingshan became addicted to opium. According to their current confessions, Liu and Zhang's expenses and gifts amounted to more than 300 million yuan. In order to eliminate evidence of embezzlement, Zhang Zishan personally burned 378 receipts at one time.

    The illegal and lawless criminal behavior of Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, and others would naturally be criticized and opposed by all loyal Communist Party members and upright government workers. Therefore, these people became the extreme sore spot in the eyes of the embezzling criminals Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, and others. In order to achieve their despicable attempt to embezzle and squander money, Liu and Zhang adopted the methods of hostile elements to treat Party organizations and people's cadres. First of all, they tried their best to create an atmosphere of "I am the only one who is respected" and "squandering is justified" in politics. Liu Qingshan said, "We risked our lives to win the country, what's wrong with enjoying some things!" "We fought for the country, let the kids enjoy it!" Zhang Zishan said that there could only be "one head" and "one leader" in the Tianjin Prefectural Committee. An shameless person even shouted "Salute to our wise leader Commissioner Zhang" at the "July 1st" commemorative meeting, "Advance under the leadership of the wise leader Commissioner Zhang," while Zhang said to others, "We should learn from this comrade." Secondly, in terms of organization, in addition to trying to suppress democracy, abolish criticism and self-criticism, and implement their patriarchal rule, all comrades who adhered to the Party's principles, safeguarded the people's interests, and raised different opinions and opposed Liu and Zhang's actions were subjected to their blows and squeezing out. All those who were weak-willed and who shared their tastes and engaged in fraud together were vigorously roped in, creating a small sectarian group that openly engaged in theft. This small group was inextricably linked to bourgeois elements ideologically and organizationally. This is the anti-Party "organizational" principle of Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, and others. Again, Liu and Zhang, "feeling guilty," in order to cover up their criminal activities, openly bribed people up and down, left and right, everywhere, pulling people into the water, so that evil winds prevailed and evil spirits rose, in order to achieve their goal of corroding Party organizations and people's cadres.

    From this, it can be seen that Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan are not only two ordinary embezzling criminals, two ordinary thieves, but, as predicted by the Second Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee, they are unable to withstand the enemy's sugar-coated bullets and have surrendered to the enemy. They have quickly and actually become agents of reactionaries within the Party, unscrupulously corroding and disintegrating the Party from within. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan openly ordered cadres to mobilize the Party organization - the vanguard of the proletariat - to "guarantee the completion" of their "task" of exploiting migrant workers for 3 billion yuan. They wanted to turn the Party in the Tianjin area into a docile tool for embezzling criminals. This is the particularly serious aspect of the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan embezzlement incident. This is precisely the fundamental reason why Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, who were once revolutionaries, were discredited and betrayed the Party and the people. This is precisely the significance of the Hebei Provincial Party organization having to take the Liu and Zhang embezzlement incident as a major lesson. This is precisely the reason why our Party must resolutely expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party and hand them over to the government for legal sanctions.

    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the North China Bureau, the Hebei Provincial Party Congress finally exposed the crimes of Liu and Zhang and expelled them from the Party. This is a major victory for the Hebei Party organization! It is hoped that all comrades in Hebei Province will accept this painful lesson, carry out an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement on a province-wide scale, eliminate the corrupting influence of the bourgeoisie, and strive to further consolidate the Hebei Party organization politically, ideologically, and organizationally under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

     中国共产党河北省委员会关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决议
    （一九五一年十二月四日河北省委员会通过，并经中共中央华北局批准）
    刘青山，前任天津地方委员会书记，河北省安国县人，雇工出身，现年三十五岁，一九三一年入党。张子善，现任天津地方委员会书记，前天津专区专员，河北省深县人，学生出身，现年三十七岁，一九三三年入党。刘青山、张子善参加革命斗争均已二十年左右，他们在国民党血腥的白色恐怖下，在艰苦的八年抗日战争和三年多的人民解放战争中，都曾奋不顾身地为党的事业和人民群众的解放，进行过英勇的斗争，树立过功绩。他们本是可以继续给党、给国家、给人民做更多的事情的。可是，他们却在全国胜利后两年多的和平环境中，经不起资产阶级自私自利思想作风的侵袭和引诱，堕落蜕化了。他们完完全全变成党、国家和人民的无可饶恕的叛徒了。
    刘青山、张子善为贪图可鄙的不正当的个人享受，为满足其极端腐化的生活需要，竟凭借职权，不顾国法党纪，不管人民疾苦，盗窃机场建筑款、救灾粮、治河款、干部家属救济粮、地方粮及剥削克扣民工工资、骗取银行贷款等共达一百五十五亿四千九百五十四万元的巨额，借机关生产名义，进行违法经营，并交送四十九亿巨款给奸商张文义倒卖钢铁木材，瓦解国营厂矿，任其投机倒把，扰乱金融，使人民资财损失达十四亿元之多。
    刘青山、张子善等在获得非法暴利、大量贪污后，则任意浪费挥霍，过着可耻的腐化生活。刘青山吸食毒品竟至成瘾，据他们现在自供，刘、张二人开支及送礼即达三亿多元。为消灭贪污罪证，张子善并亲手一次焚毁单据三百七十八张。
    刘青山、张子善这种违法乱纪的非法罪恶行为，自然会遭到一切忠诚的共产党员和正直的政府工作人员的指责和反对的，因此，这些人们就成为刘青山、张子善等贪污罪犯极端痛恨的眼中钉。刘、张二人为遂行其贪污挥霍的卑鄙企图，就采取了敌对分子的手段来对待党的组织和人民干部。首先，他们在政治上极力造成一个“惟我独尊”和“挥霍有道”的空气。刘青山说“老子们拚命打了天下，享受些又怎么样！”“老子们打天下，小子们来享受！”张子善则说是天津地委内只能有“一个头”、“一个领袖”。有一个无耻之徒竟在“七一”纪念大会上高呼“向我们英明的领袖张专员致敬”，“在英明领袖张专员领导下前进”，而张则对人说：“应向这个同志学习”。其次，他们在组织上除极力压抑民主、取消批评与自我批评、施行其家长制的统治外，凡是坚持党的原则，维护人民利益，对刘、张所为提出不同意见和反对他们的同志，莫不遭受其打击与排挤；凡是意志薄弱和他们气味相投、共同作弊的分子，则大肆拉拢，造成一个公然行盗的小宗派集团。这个小集团在思想上和组织上又是和资产阶级分子千丝万缕地结成了不解之缘。这就是刘青山、张子善等反党的“组织”原则。再次，刘、张“作贼心虚”，为了掩盖其罪恶勾当，则在上下左右之间公行贿赂，到处拉人下水，恶风所及，邪气上升，以达其腐蚀党的组织和人民干部的目的。
    由此可见，刘青山、张子善已不仅仅是两个普通的贪污罪犯，两个普通的窃盗，而是像党的二中全会所预见的，他们是经不起敌人糖衣炮弹的攻击，向敌人投降了的，并很快地实际上成为反动分子在党内的代理人，肆无忌惮地从内部来腐蚀党和瓦解党。刘青山、张子善公然责令干部，要动员党的组织——无产阶级的先锋队，“保证完成”他们剥削民工三十亿元的“任务”。他们要把天津地区的党变成贪污罪犯们的驯服的工具，这就是刘青山、张子善贪污事件的特别严重的地方。这一点，也正是曾经是一个革命者的刘青山、张子善身败名裂、背叛党和背叛人民的根本原因，正是河北省的党组织必须把刘、张贪污事件作为重大教训的意义所在，正是我党必须坚决把刘青山、张子善开除出党并交政府依法制裁的理由。
    在党中央和华北局的正确领导下，河北省党代表会议终于揭发了刘、张的罪行，并把他们开除出党，这是河北党的组织的一大胜利！希望河北全省同志，接受这一痛心的教训，为开展全省规模的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，肃清资产阶级的腐化影响，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，为进一步从政治上、思想上、组织上巩固河北党的组织而奋斗。
