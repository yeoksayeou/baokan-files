To the Editor:

    It is extremely wrong for the leading cadres of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway Realignment Project Office (located in Yangquan) under the Tianjin Railway Administration to disregard the phenomenon of waste. In September of this year, when the Project Office was working in the Fourth Construction Zone, in order to facilitate the transport of materials, they paved a road across two nearby river beaches. These two river beaches were already dry, just not level enough. The Project Office could have used ten workers to pave them with stones in a single day. But the Project Office didn't do this; instead, they used more than 1,200 new white pine railway sleepers, laying them flat on the two river beaches and nailing them together to make a wooden road. Now, the work in the Fourth Construction Zone is basically finished, but this wooden road has not been removed, and the damage rate of most of the sleepers has reached 30 percent; a small portion can no longer be used. The leading cadres of the Project Office must have passed by here countless times, but they have all turned a blind eye and remained indifferent. In addition, in July of this year, due to the difficulty in providing accommodations for employees in Yangquan, the Project Office buried more than 4,100 white pine railway sleepers (two-thirds new, one-third 80% new) in a damp area to build a 2,000-square-meter building. The damage rate of these sleepers, which have been buried for half a year, is also around 30 percent. For the above two items, the Project Office used a total of 5,300 railway sleepers. Calculating the damage at 30 percent per sleeper, the loss amounts to 1,590 sleepers, which, at current prices, is equivalent to approximately 159 million yuan. In order to prevent further losses of people's property, I hope that the leading cadres of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway Realignment Project Office will promptly deal with these two batches of railway sleepers.

    石太改线工程处领导干部
    漠视浪费枕木现象损失一亿多元
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局石太改线工程处（在阳泉）领导干部漠视浪费现象，是非常错误的。今年九月，工程处在第四工区施工时，为了往来搬运材料方便，就把附近两个河滩，铺成一条马路。这两个河滩已没有水，就是不够平坦。工程处只要用十个工人，利用石块，一天内就能铺成。但工程处不这样做，却用一千二百多根新的白松枕木，平铺在两个河滩里，还把这些枕木连钉起来，成为一条木马路。现在，第四工区的工程已基本结束，但这条木马路仍然没有撤走，大部分枕木损坏率，已达百分之三十；一小部分已不能再用了。工程处领导干部在这里不知往来过多少次，但都熟视无睹，不闻不问。另外，今年七月间，工程处因阳泉职工宿舍困难，就把四千一百多根白松枕木（三分之二是新的，三分之一是八成新的），栽埋在一片潮湿的地上，搭成一座二千平方公尺的房子。这批埋了半年的枕木的损坏率，也在百分之三十左右。以上两项，工程处共用枕木五千三百根，以每根损坏三成计算，要损失枕木一千五百九十根，按照时价，折合人民币约一亿五千九百万元。为了使人民财产不再继续损耗下去，我希望石太改线工程处领导干部迅速处理这两批枕木。        高方
