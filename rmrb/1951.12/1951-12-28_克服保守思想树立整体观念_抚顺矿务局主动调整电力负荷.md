Overcoming Conservative Thinking and Establishing an Overall Perspective
    Fushun Mining Bureau Actively Adjusts Power Load
    Since August 1950, the Fushun Mining Bureau in Northeast China has implemented economic operation, strengthened power dispatching, and adjusted power load, which has achieved great results. The daily load rate of the entire bureau has increased from 77 percent in May 1950 to 96.9 percent on August 15, 1951, thereby shortening the fluctuation distance between the daily peak load and the minimum load. Before adjusting the load in 1950, this distance was 16,800 kW, and in August 1951 it had been reduced to 3,400 kW. The increase in the daily load rate not only saved the country electricity and power generation equipment, but also reduced the fixed electricity costs of the mining bureau and lowered the cost of products. In the year from August last year to August this year, the Fushun Mining Bureau has saved 1.3 billion yuan in this regard. At the same time, the balance of load has also guaranteed the normal operation of factory and mine production equipment, strengthened equipment maintenance, and reduced accidents. The gains from Fushun's load adjustment prove that adjusting the power load not only helps the power system to fully exploit its potential, but is also beneficial and harmless to the power-consuming units themselves. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the experience of the Fushun Mining Bureau is worthy of attention.
    The main points of Fushun Mining Bureau's experience in adjusting power load are as follows:
    (1) Correcting leadership thinking and strengthening the overall perspective is the key to adjusting the power load.
    In the past, the leading cadres of various factories and mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau had local views and conservative ideas on the issue of load adjustment. They did not pay enough attention to the work of adjusting power load, increasing load rate, and improving dispatch management. This thinking is manifested in: 1. The operation of large power equipment in various factories and mines has no regularity and no start-stop plan. 2. Some leading cadres of factories and mines have departmentalism, only focusing on the production of their own units, regardless of power dispatching. Some workshop leaders emphasized that dispatching would affect production in order to win extra rewards. 3. The regulations of various substations are not sound enough, and the operating skills of the operators are poor, which often causes power outages and reduces the load rate. 4. When some factories start their machines, the required power is very large, which affects the stability of the overall load, thus wasting a lot of electricity. The leading cadres of these factories did not try to reduce the power required to start the machines. The consequence of the above situations is that the daily load rate is very low and the peak load continues to rise. The fluctuation distance between the highest load and the lowest load in 24 hours once reached 16,800 kW. This not only wasted the country's electricity, but also required the mining bureau to pay huge basic electricity fees to the power bureau every month, thus increasing the cost of various products.
    Later, the leading cadres of the mining bureau recognized the great political and economic significance of adjusting the power load and saving electricity, and established an overall perspective. At the same time, they carefully calculated the then electricity waste, and found that after adjusting the power load, it would not hinder production, but could reduce the expenditure of basic electricity fees. After the leadership's thinking changed, the Fushun Mining Bureau took practical and effective methods based on the actual situation and actively carried out the work of adjusting the power load. The gains from adjusting the power load are great. By August of this year, the monthly load rate has reached 85 percent, and the daily load rate has reached 96.9 percent. By reducing the sharp changes in the power load, the mining bureau often saves 6,000 kW of power load, and the power consumption has increased by more than 30 percent compared with the past.
    (2) Establishing and improving the dispatching organization and uniformly grasping the dispatching work is the basic condition for the comprehensive development of the power load adjustment work.
    The Fushun Mining Bureau Electric Power Office established a power dispatching command room with special responsibilities. The power dispatching command room is the central power dispatching executive agency. Each factory and mine also set up a power dispatching room. The power dispatching room controls the power load of the factory and mine. The dispatching organization is equipped with special dispatchers. These dispatchers are familiar with the production procedures and dispatching business of various factories and mines, and master the power consumption rules of various factories and mines.
    The Fushun Mining Bureau has established a global large power equipment start-stop chart management system. The power dispatching system uses this method to control the operation of large power. The unplanned and irregular operation of large power equipment will cause sudden changes in peak load, making it impossible for the central dispatching agency to grasp; the improvement of the power load rate will also be seriously affected. After research by the comrades responsible for dispatching, they found the regularity of large power operation, and reported the predicted figures of the number of large power starts and stops, times, time, and load per day to the dispatching command room in the form of charts. Without affecting production, the dispatching command room flexibly adjusts the operation time of large power according to the charts. The result of this adjustment ensures the balance of power consumption at every time in the overall situation and prevents the rise of peak load. For example, the power required for filling work in a certain mine is unbalanced day and night. The dispatching command room and them have repeatedly studied and improved the production procedures to make the filling operation balanced day and night, and the power load is stable. Another example is that the power used when the electric furnace in the steel plant starts to operate is very large. After measuring the smelting power curve and finding the rules, the time when the electric furnace starts smelting is staggered, and the surge phenomenon of the inrush current at the beginning of smelting is smoothed. The result of this adjustment not only saves a lot of electricity, but also does not prolong the smelting time.
    (3) Establishing various systems within the dispatching system is a powerful guarantee for adjusting the power load.
    (A) Hourly report system of electricity. Each substation reports the total power consumption of the previous hour to the Power Dispatching Command Room every hour. The Dispatching Command Room compares the estimated power consumption with the actual power consumption and makes necessary corrections and dispatches. In this way, the Dispatching Command Room can timely and actively grasp the power consumption of each unit, so as to further grasp the load changes and maintain the overall power balance.
    (B) Large power start-stop reporting system. Each factory and mine must report the start-stop situation of large power to the dispatching command room, so that the dispatching command room can timely grasp the operation of the main equipment.
    (C) Operation audit system. Each substation should report the operation of important mechanical power receiving and power supply to the dispatching command room, so that the dispatching command room can review their operation procedures, monitor and control the operation of all important equipment, so as to reduce operation accidents.
    (D) Each substation also implements a regular inspection system, a power outage operation system, and an accident reporting system, and promotes operating regulations, dispatching regulations, and power distribution regulations. These systems play a significant role in ensuring the overall power dispatching and reducing mechanical failures.
    In addition, the implementation of the two-part electricity price system by the Northeast Electric Power Management Bureau is also one of the main reasons why the Fushun Mining Bureau's power load adjustment work can be carried out smoothly. The two-part electricity price system is an advanced and reasonable electricity price system. This system divides the electricity charges borne by users into two types according to the analysis of power costs: one is fixed costs, such as depreciation costs in power costs; the other is unfixed costs, such as coal costs. The part of the electricity charge equivalent to the fixed cost is called the basic electricity charge or fixed electricity charge; the part equivalent to the unfixed cost is called the electricity charge per kilowatt-hour. The basic electricity charge is calculated according to the user's maximum power demand or equipment capacity, because the power bureau must set up power generation and power supply equipment according to the user unit's maximum needs. The electricity charge per kilowatt-hour is calculated according to the number of kilowatt-hours used. The sum of these two costs is the electricity bill that the user should pay each month. With the implementation of the two-part electricity price system, factories and mining enterprises are willing to actively find ways to adjust the power load and increase the utilization rate of power equipment in order to reduce the basic electricity costs of their units. At the same time, it can also encourage power-consuming units to use as much electricity as possible to increase production. Because under the condition that the equipment capacity remains unchanged, the more electricity is used, the lower the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour. The situation of Fushun Mining Bureau's adjustment of power load has fully proved this point. (Qi Ming)

    克服保守思想树立整体观念
    抚顺矿务局主动调整电力负荷
    东北抚顺矿务局自一九五○年八月开始实行经济运转，加强电力调度，调整电力负荷，已经收到很大的成效。全局日负荷率已由一九五○年五月份的百分之七十七提高到一九五一年八月十五日的百分之九十六点九，从而缩短了每日最高负荷和最低负荷间的跳动距离。一九五○年调整负荷前，这个距离是一六八○○瓩，一九五一年八月份已降低到三四○○瓩。日负荷率的提高，不但为国家节省了电力和发电设备，并且减少了矿务局的固定电费，降低了产品的成本。从去年八月到今年八月的一年中，抚顺矿务局在这方面已经节省了十三亿元人民币。同时，由于负荷的平衡，还保证了厂矿生产设备的正常运转，加强了设备的保养维护，减少了事故。抚顺调整负荷的收获证明，调整电力负荷，不但有助于电业系统充分发挥潜在能力，对用电单位本身说，也是有利无害的。在增产节约运动中，抚顺矿务局的经验是值得注意的。
    抚顺矿务局调整电力负荷的经验主要有以下几点：
    （一）端正领导思想，加强整体观念，是调整电力负荷的关键。
    过去抚顺矿务局所属各厂矿的领导干部，在调整负荷的问题上是有局部观点和保守思想的。他们对于调整电力负荷、提高负荷率、改善调度管理的工作是不够重视的。这种思想表现在：1、各厂矿大动力设备的运转没有规律，没有开停计划。2、某些厂矿的领导干部有本位主义思想，只重视本单位的生产，不管电力的调度。有些车间的领导干部为了争取超额奖励，强调进行调度就会影响生产。3、各变电所制度不够健全，加以运行人员操作技术不良，时常造成停电事故，使负荷率降低。4、某些工厂在开动机器时，所需电力很大，影响全局负荷的平稳，因此浪费了不少电力。而这些厂的领导干部并没有设法把开动机器时所需的电力压低。以上这些情况所造成的后果，是日负荷率很低，高峰负荷不断上涨。二十四小时内最高负荷和最低负荷中间的跳动距离曾达一六八○○瓩。这不仅浪费了国家的电力，而且矿务局每月还必须向电业局支付巨额的基本电费，因此增加了各种产品的成本。
    后来矿务局的领导干部认识了调整电力负荷，节约电力的重大政治经济意义，树立了整体观念。同时他们又仔细计算了当时电力浪费的情况，发现调整电力负荷后，不但不妨碍生产，反而可以减少基本电费的支出。领导思想转变了以后，抚顺矿务局就根据实际情况，采取切实可行的有效方法，积极地进行调整电力负荷的工作。调整电力负荷的收获是很大的。到今年八月为止，月负荷率已达到百分之八十五，日负荷率已达到百分之九十六点九。由于减轻了电力负荷的急剧变化，矿务局经常节约电力负荷六千瓩，而用电量还比过去增加了百分之三十以上。
    （二）建立和健全调度组织，统一掌握调度工作，是调整电力负荷工作得以全面展开的基本条件。
    抚顺矿务局电力事务所建立了有专责的电力调度司令室。电力调度司令室是中心电力调度执行机构。各厂矿也设立电力调度室。电力调度室掌握厂矿用电负荷。调度组织中配备有专责的调度人员。这些调度人员，熟悉各厂矿生产程序和调度业务，并掌握各厂矿用电规律。
    抚顺矿务局建立了全局范围的大动力设备开停图表管理制度。电力调度系统以这个办法掌握大动力的运转。大动力设备无计划、无规律的运转会使高峰负荷突变，使中心调度机构无法掌握；电力负荷率的提高，也将受到严重的影响。经过负责调度工作的同志们研究，找出了大动力运转的规律性，把每日大动力开停台数、次数、时间、负荷，按一昼夜的预测数字绘成图表报告给调度司令室。在不影响生产的情况下，调度司令室根据图表灵活地调整大动力的运转时间。这样调整的结果就保证了全局每一时间用电的平衡性，制止高峰负荷的上涨。例如某矿填充工作所需电力日夜不平衡。调度司令室和他们多次研究，改进了生产程序，使填充作业日夜均衡起来，电力负荷就平稳了。又如制钢厂电炉运转开始时所用电力很大，经过测定冶炼电力曲线，找出规律，把电炉冶炼开始的时间错开，并平复了冶炼开始时冲激电流的突变现象。这样调整的结果，不但节省了好多电力，并且没有延长冶炼时间。
    （三）建立调度系统内的各项制度，是调整电力负荷的有力保证。
    （甲）电量一小时通报制。各变电所每隔一小时向电力调度司令室报告前一小时用电总量。调度司令室把预计用电和实际用电情况互相对照，进行必要的修正和调度。这样，调度司令室就能及时地主动地掌握各单位用电的情况，以便更进一步地掌握负荷的变动情况，保持全局用电平衡。
    （乙）大动力开停报告制度。各厂矿必须把大动力的开停情况报告调度司令室，以便调度司令室及时掌握主要设备运转情况。
    （丙）操作审核制度。各变电所要把重要机械受电供电的操作情况，报告给调度司令室，以便调度司令室审核他们的操作程序，监视和控制所有重要设备的运转情况，以减少操作事故。
    （丁）各变电所还实行了定期检查制度、停电作业制度、事故报告制度，并推行运转规程、调度规程和配电规程。这些制度对全局用电调度的保证，以及减少机械故障，是有重大作用的。
    另外，东北电业管理总局实行两部电价制度，也是抚顺矿务局调整电力负荷工作得以顺利进行的主要原因之一。两部电价制是一种先进的合理的电价制度。这种制度是把用户所负担的电费，根据电力成本的分析，分为两种：一是固定费用，例如电力成本中的折旧费等；一为不固定费用，例如燃煤费等。在电费中相当于固定费用的部分称为基本电费或固定电费；相当于不固定费用的称为电度电费。基本电费是按照用户的最高需电量或设备容量计算的，因为电业局须要根据用电单位的最高需要设置发电供电设备。电度电费是按照用电度数计算的。这两种费用的总和就是用户每月应缴的电费。实行了两部电价制度，厂矿企业就肯主动地想办法调整电力负荷，提高电力设备的利用率，以便减少本单位的基本电费。同时，还能鼓励用电单位尽量多用电以增加生产。因为在设备容量不变的情况下，用电越多，平均每度电的电价越低。抚顺矿务局调整电力负荷的情况，已经充分证明了这一点。（齐明）
