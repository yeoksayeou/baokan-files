Strive to Improve the Ideological and Militant Nature of Our Publications
    ——Speech at the Mobilization Meeting for Rectification and Study in Beijing's Literary and Art Circles
    Ding Ling

In the past two years, we have published many periodicals. According to statistics in May of this year, there are more than 90 literary and art periodicals nationwide alone, most of which are mediocre, aimless, and have no sales. After the Propaganda Conference, local publications have undergone some adjustments and changes in their editorial policies, but no significant changes or reviews or new plans have been seen in large national publications; therefore, improving our publications and enhancing their political, ideological, and militant nature is an urgent task in this study. I will talk about this issue today.

Literary and artistic publications are tools for expressing literary and artistic thought activities. All activities, creations, criticisms, and learning results are published here. The achievements and shortcomings of literary and artistic work rely on publications to reach the masses and have good or bad influences. Our publications are the command post of our work. We must rectify our thinking, style, and work system, and we must also rectify our publications, rectify our mouthpiece, and rectify the tool that connects us most closely with the masses. Without rectifying our thinking, there is no way to run a magazine well. In rectifying our thinking, we must first clarify our understanding of the tasks of magazines and publications, and then formulate our future policies and work steps.

The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference once gave us such a provision: "The main tasks of the people's government's cultural and educational work should be to improve the people's cultural level, cultivate talents for national construction, eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideology, and develop the idea of serving the people." This provision is very clear. We should bring the problems occurring in people's lives today to our publications, stand on the people's position, use a new outlook on life to analyze them, educate the people, so that they can carry out struggle against all the remnants of the old ideology, bourgeois ideology, and petty-bourgeois ideology under the leadership of the working class, and obtain solutions. We once accepted this program in a general way, but we have not paid enough attention to how to understand and implement it more deeply from our own work.

Many of us still treat our publications today with a traditional and old point of view. We often regard publications as just a matter for a small group of people. In the past, a small group of people controlled a publication (that is, a so-called coterie publication), published the thoughts of this group, publicized the thoughts of this group, opposed some of the things they wanted to oppose, were also impassioned, and also complained. Some of these publications once played a positive role because they were controlled by progressive people, and some editorial departments reflected some of the party's policies because there were party members. But this way of running publications is outdated. We should understand that we are already in a new era. We are already the masters, and the country and the people need our publications to assume the task of ideological leadership, to lead the masses to participate in all ideological struggles in life, and to guide and organize writers to complete this task together. We like to run publications, but we lack courage and a sense of responsibility. We regard a publication that has the responsibility of leadership as a publication of an observer. The purpose of publication is not clear, the political attitude is vague, the thinking is not sharp, and even follows the backward masses. There is no militancy, and the goal of the battle is naturally unclear. I myself have this shortcoming. When I was working as an editor at the "Literary Gazette," when someone pointed out that the "Literary Gazette" should be a publication of ideological leadership, a publication that guides literary and artistic thought and literary and artistic movements, I always felt a little uneasy in my heart, and I always wanted to avoid letting the "Literary Gazette" wear this hat. I did not ask whether the "Literary Gazette" should actually bear the responsibility of guidance, but only thought about the problem from a personal perspective, because wearing this hat would make the responsibility even more serious, which is a manifestation of my fear of responsibility.

Since publications are for educating the masses, all issues must start from the masses and must be well connected with the masses. Comrade Stalin wrote in the editorial of the "Struggle News" when it was founded in 1901:

    The most important responsibility of the newspaper - is to be as close as possible to the working class
    masses, to influence them as often as possible, as their conscious and leading center.

and said:

    The press - is the most favorable weapon, with its help
    under, the party speaks to the working class every day, every hour, in its own language, in the language needed by the party, and expands the spiritual connection between the party and the class.
    Between the party and the class there is no other tool for expanding spiritual connection, no other similar flexible organ, in the world.

Although these words are an evaluation of political newspapers, they are also completely applicable to our publications. Connecting with the masses is the primary task of publications. The issues raised by the editorial department must be the issues that the masses are urgently demanding to solve today, that is, all issues that should be brought into the ideological field in the entire political activity and people's lives, all issues of the battle between new and old ideas in life. For example, should we continue to follow the people's government and engage in construction under the leadership of the working class, or should we follow the reactionary class to violate government policies and oppose the people? Should we resist the United States and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, or should we seek temporary ease and comfort and linger on in a state of individualistic existence? Should we praise Wu Xun's slavish thinking, or should we oppose this reactionary thinking that violates the interests of the people? Publications should mobilize the broad masses to pay attention to these issues, to become interested in these most meaningful ideological issues in real life, to launch discussions, and to pay attention to the tendencies in the discussions at any time. Publications should organize creation and lead creation according to these needs of the masses; organize criticism and launch criticism; organize learning and help writers to approach life, approach the masses, touch on the most important themes, correct their erroneous views on creative thinking and creative methods, guide them to move forward along the correct creative path, and write works that are needed by the people, welcomed by the masses, but also educate the masses.

Since publications are the most concentrated expression of the leading ideology of our literary and art work departments, and are the command post of the literary and art front, then all the remarks issued from here represent the principled standards of the entire movement. Therefore, the persons in charge and staff of the editorial department should not be ordinary manuscript readers or manuscript collectors. They should have a high degree of clear ideological content, be most able to judge right and wrong, dare to be responsible for expressing what they support, what they advocate, what they publicize, and what they oppose, and they should support it enthusiastically and oppose it resolutely. Gorky once said: "The editor is someone who guides writers and educates writers to some extent." Therefore, the editor must know more than the writer. He is his first reader and critic, and also the first to consider the influence that a work will have on the masses. He should help the writer from the task of the publication and from the perspective of the masses, make up for some of the shortcomings in this work, improve the political role that the work can play, and do better artistic processing. Therefore, the editorial staff should first recognize the importance and responsibility of this work position for the country and the people. They should be proud to be able to undertake this work, and work hard to study diligently, constantly improve their level of Marxist-Leninist theory, policy thinking, and literary and artistic accomplishment; work diligently, humbly and cautiously in their daily work, and check it at any time.

Our publications (referring to national publications) have not completed the above tasks very well. It is not to say that our publications have not played a role. Our publications have also published some better works, and there have also been some more important criticisms. Most of our editorial staff are still working very hard and want to run the publications well. However, compared with the work of other departments, it is far behind. We have not reflected the great changes and achievements of the past two years well, and our publications are not satisfactory. We often hear criticisms from the masses, and we cannot help but think about the reasons for this.

The first is that our publications themselves lack ideological content and do not have clear policies and tasks. Take the "Literary Gazette" as an example. It is the organ publication of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Has the Standing Committee of the Federation discussed why such a publication should be published? I know it has not. When I accepted this task, the instruction I received was that the "Literary Gazette" is a membership publication, publishing documents such as instructions, calls, resolutions, reports from various places, and work experience. I personally am not satisfied with the nature of this publication. Based on this instruction, several of us formulated a policy, which is that "the Literary Gazette is a publication that connects literary and artistic work with the broad masses, and is used to reflect the situation of literary and artistic work, exchange experience, study problems, launch literary and artistic criticism, and promote literary and artistic movements." This policy, as it seems now, is extremely unclear. Any publication can write this. Which one do we focus on, and where do we promote the literary and artistic movement? After this policy was published, no one has ever questioned us. Starting from the third volume, the "Literary Gazette" focused its policy on learning and criticism, but no one raised any questions, and the "Literary Gazette" did not conduct an in-depth review based on this policy. The inaugural speech of "People's Literature" showed even more laziness in using thought. It copied the six articles of association of the Literary Association in the front, and then said, "How to concretize it is the responsibility of this journal." How to concretize it? It did not say, but only added the responsibility to everyone. Then it asked for various forms of manuscripts, and did not clearly stipulate the ideological and content standards for the manuscripts, but focused on saying: "Finally, the editorial department of this journal also has an opinion to report to colleagues in the literary and artistic circles on this occasion. We feel that editing a magazine is actually a kind of organization work. First, we must be good at organizing manuscripts so that the content of the magazine is not simple and not biased; second, we must be good at inviting writers to write manuscripts in a planned way, so that each issue of the magazine can grasp the central link of our literary and artistic work and be rich in flexibility. We hope to use this method to make this journal lively, multi-faceted, and not without focus as much as possible." From this inaugural speech, we just can't find the focus of this journal. The Standing Committee of the Literary Association or the editorial department did not discuss the policy of this journal as the organ publication of the Literary Association. I am also one of the persons in charge of the Literary Association, and I did not care, as if this was just a matter for Comrade Mao Dun and Comrade Ai Qing. I am only raising it today, and I should be severely criticized for this matter. If we want to give another example, we can also give "People's Drama." This publication has neither an inaugural speech nor any editor's words. However, if this publication does not indicate the publication date, you can simply regard it as an old publication from the past few years, and you can't find any characteristics of the times. I will not list the remaining examples in detail. When we examine the thoughts of these leading publications, they are indeed unclear, very vague, and do not have a leader's feeling or a responsible person's attitude at all. In the army, it is very clear what the command post should do when fighting a war. I think there can't be such a command post in the world, where the commander only wants to fight but does not make a battle plan, does not issue orders, has no battle line, and even has no clear enemy and friend. If there is, such a command post will only lose the battle.

Lack of ideological content, unclear tasks, and unclear goals are already difficult to handle, but we all like to run publications (the same is true locally, any place with a few people who can write articles must run a publication). In 1949, Comrade Hu Qiaomu proposed to merge the "Literary Gazette" and the "People's Literature" of the "People's Daily," but I insisted on disagreeing; in 1950, Comrade Hu Qiaomu proposed to reduce the number of publications, and I agreed, but the persons in charge of the Drama Association, the Fine Arts Association, and the Music Association disagreed, emphasizing that they had their readers and needs. With so many publications, manuscripts are scattered. There are not many of us who can do some research work and write articles. In addition, the division of labor between publications is not clear. A manuscript can be published in this publication or in that publication, so it is more difficult for the editorial department to organize manuscripts in a planned way, and they have to lower the level of the manuscripts. When there are three good manuscripts, they are reluctant to publish them all at once. If they leave one for the next issue, then they will put in a few manuscripts that are not very good, or that do not necessarily need to be published. In this way, how can we improve the quality of our publications?

The quality of our publications is not high enough, and there are dispensable articles in any publication. The "Literary Gazette" often has some unnecessary criticisms, or inappropriate attitudes or wording in the criticism text. Although "People's Literature" has also published some better works, it has also published some bad works, such as "Between Our Couple" and "The Story of Smoke"; "Singing and Talking" has also published works like "Golden Lock" that distort the working people. These have all been pointed out by the masses, but we have not yet seen any publication conduct an in-depth review. How did we publish these works? Why do we like these works and want to recommend these works to readers?

Secondly, the persons in charge of the publications do not have enough sense of responsibility. We hear some voices from editorial staff who are not at ease with their work, some complaints, and rarely hear self-criticism and active thinking about solutions. Because the sense of responsibility to the masses is low, they will not care much about the masses, they will lose the political sensitivity from the masses, and the selection of manuscripts will not be based on certain political requirements, but based on personal appreciation level and interest. Even some persons in charge cannot completely do the final review of the manuscripts. Isn't this very dangerous? I think that editorial staff who do not have a sense of responsibility and often take a perfunctory attitude towards their work should be regarded as a labor discipline issue, and should be considered a dereliction of duty, and must be strictly criticized. The editorial staff also does not organize manuscripts in a planned way. Some do not organize at all, but sit in the office and wait for manuscripts. Some editorial departments randomly find some people to serve as editors, hold a meeting after a while, do not discuss any issues at the meeting, but only distribute a few manuscripts, regardless of whether the distributees have the conditions to write. The editor-in-chief comes up with topics, which are only temporarily thought of in an inspirational way. As a result, the distributed manuscripts are often not handed in. I think it doesn't matter if they are not handed in, because manuscripts that are not assigned according to needs and abilities may not be written well. The editor is not an omnipotent writer who can write about anything; if there is such an omnipotent editor who thinks he knows everything, he actually knows nothing.

Furthermore, the persons in charge of the publications lack self-criticism, are afraid of criticism, and do not like to listen to criticism. If someone makes an opinion on any article in the publication he edited, he will pull you to unprincipled personal relationships, saying that you have prejudice against them, or that your group has problems with their group. The only purpose of doing this is to make people who make opinions dare not make them again, and to make people unwilling to get entangled in personal relationships and seal their mouths. The "Literary Gazette" is a critical publication, and it is inevitable that it will have some criticisms of certain articles, and it has encountered this situation. Sometimes I insisted, and sometimes I surrendered to this situation. I have been very painful, because I was afraid of offending friends, so I would rather not be responsible to the masses. I value friends more than the masses, and I value personal troubles more. I am a timid individualist! I like that passage of Stalin's words quoted by Zhdanov very much, and I might as well quote it to arouse our vigilance:

    If we want to preserve cadres, to educate and train them, we
    We should not be afraid of offending anyone, we should not be afraid of carrying out original
    Principled, bold, frank and objective criticism. Without criticism
    Criticism, any organization, including literary organizations, will decay.
    Without criticism, any disease will penetrate into the marrow and be difficult to cure.
    Only bold and straightforward criticism will help our
    People improve, encourage them to move forward and overcome their work
    Shortcomings. Where there is no criticism, there is stench and stagnation
    Root, there is no room for progress. Comrade Stalin has repeatedly pointed out:
    The most important condition for our development is that every Soviet people
    Must sum up their work every day, fearlessly check themselves
    Analyze their own work, bravely criticize their shortcomings and
    Mistakes, think carefully about how to make their work better
    Achievements, and work continuously to improve themselves. This applies
    To writers, as it applies to any other staff member.
    Whoever is afraid of criticizing his work is a despicable coward.
    Not worthy of the respect of the people.

These instructions should become the motto of the publication editor!

There are also some leaders and editorial staff of publications who, at certain times, their thinking lags far behind the actual ideological struggle of the masses. For example, the 18th issue of "Singing and Talking" published an "Introduction to the 'Wu Xun' Issue." The "People's Daily" had already published an editorial on "The Biography of Wu Xun," and the discussion of "The Biography of Wu Xun" had already been launched enthusiastically. When the masses were angrily criticizing it, there came a purely "objective" introduction, which shows that the editor did not understand the significance of the discussion on "The Biography of Wu Xun" that was unfolding, and also shows the editor's own ideological confusion.

Individual publications also have small group tendencies. For example, the first few issues of "People's Drama" used many pages to publish the works of the editor-in-chief. Later, the editor-in-chief of "People's Drama" was replaced by someone from the Central Academy of Drama, and most of the manuscripts were from comrades of the Academy of Drama. One thing that I think is the worst is that when the several short plays created by the comrades of the Central Academy of Drama ("Mother's Heart," "The Will of the People," etc.) were staged, they received some criticisms. These criticisms were correct and not excessive, but the leaders of the Creation Office of the Central Academy of Drama and the editor-in-chief of "People's Drama" wrote an article praising these three short plays and published it in "People's Drama." Later, although this comrade editor-in-chief made a review, it was not profound. Why did he use the position of editor-in-chief to publish such an article casually?

In addition, as everyone knows, the editorial attitudes of the "Literary Review" of "Guangming Daily" and the "Literary Criticism" of "Xinmin Daily" are also not serious.

Even so, I believe that our publications can be run well. In order to strengthen our publications, we should first rely on the leadership and activities of literary and artistic organizations. The various associations led by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles should pay close attention to the publications when leading literary and artistic work, so that the publications become the center for uniting the masses and uniting writers, and become the center for criticism and self-criticism, so as to educate the masses with the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and encourage the masses to move towards the goal of serving the people with noble qualities. This decision of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles to adjust publications is correct. This rectification and study initiated by the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles will be a turning point for our publications. Most of our editorial staff hope to run the publications well, so they will also deeply examine their own shortcomings in this study, overcome them, correct them, and formulate new plans to work conscientiously.

Creation and criticism can be organized. We have organized them in the past, but because the policies were not clear, the organized manuscripts were not in a good plan. From our experience, we also know that relatively organized manuscripts are manuscripts needed by the masses, and can get more and better reflections. Whether the manuscripts can be organized depends on whether the work of the editorial department is active. The editorial department should often convene some symposiums on works and some symposiums on issues. The editorial department should collect and study some existing problems, provide materials to writers, and help writers go to the countryside, go to factories, and go to the army to help them write. The editorial department is the organizer, but not just someone who is concerned with writing. If the staff of the editorial department moves and uses their brains, the writers will also move, the problems will also become active, and there will be more articles. With more articles and active ideological discussions, it is meaningful to edit publications in this way. The editorial department is not afraid of not having manuscripts, but is afraid of not being proactive. Our masses are active, and some of the big and small mistakes in our articles are first pointed out by the readers. The eyes of the masses are the brightest, and relying on the masses is the best way. Remembering the masses and remembering Marxism-Leninism at all times and in all places is invincible.

Comrades, work hard, we have so many readers, so many writers, our country has embarked on a glorious era, we have the ideological leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we can definitely run our publications well, and live up to our glorious task and the great era. Comrades, work hard, study hard, and strive to improve the political, ideological, and militant nature of our publications!

    为提高我们刊物的思想性、战斗性而斗争
    ——在北京文艺界整风学习动员大会上的讲话
    丁玲
    这两年来，我们出版了不少刊物，据今年五月间统计，仅仅文艺刊物，全国一共有九十多种，其中大部分是不上不下，毫无目的，也没有销路的杂志。宣传会议后，地方刊物都有些调整，在编辑方针上也有些改变，但全国性的大型刊物都看不出有什么显著的改变，也没有看到有所检讨或新的计划；因此在这次学习中，改进我们的刊物，提高刊物的政治性、思想性和战斗性是一个迫切的任务。我今天就这个问题谈一谈。
    文学艺术的刊物，是表现文学艺术思想活动的工具，一切活动，创作的、批评的、学习的结果都在这里发表出来。文学艺术工作的成就和缺点都凭借刊物到群众中去发生好的或坏的影响。我们的刊物是我们工作的司令台，我们要整顿我们的思想、作风、工作制度，也必须要整顿我们的刊物，整顿我们的喉舌，整顿我们与群众联系的最密切的工具。不整顿思想，杂志没有办法办好。在整顿思想中首先要把我们对杂志刊物的认识、任务搞清楚，从而订下我们今后的方针以及工作的步骤。
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领上曾经给我们作过这样的规定：“人民政府的文化教育工作，应以提高人民文化水平、培养国家建设人才、肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想、发展为人民服务的思想为主要任务。”这个规定是很明白的。我们应该把今天人民生活中所发生的问题提到我们刊物上来，站在人民的立场，用新的人生观去分析，以教育人民，使他们能在工人阶级思想的领导下向旧的一切残余的思想，资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想进行斗争，并获得解决。我们曾经笼统地接受过这条纲领，但如何从自己的工作上去更深刻地理解和执行，就没有很好地注意。
    我们还有很多人用一种传统的观点，旧的观点去对待我们今天的刊物。把刊物常常看成只是一伙人的事。过去一小伙人掌握了一个刊物（即是所谓同人刊物），发表这一伙人的思想，宣传这一伙人的思想，反对一些他们要反对的，也慷慨激昂过，也发牢骚，这些刊物有的曾经因为被进步人士所掌握，当时起过一些积极的作用，有的编辑部里因为有过党员，曾反映过一些党的政策。但这种办刊物的办法，已经过时了，我们应该明白我们已经处于另外一个崭新的时代了。我们已经是主人，国家和人民需要我们的刊物能担当思想领导的任务，能带领群众参加一切生活中的思想斗争，并且能引导和组织作家们一同完成这个任务。我们喜欢办刊物，但我们却缺乏勇气，缺乏责任感，把一个负有领导责任的刊物当成是一个旁观者的刊物，出版的目的不明确，政治态度模糊，思想不尖锐，甚至跟着落后的群众走，没有战斗性，战斗的目标自然也是不清楚的。我自己就有这个缺点。我在“文艺报”担任编辑工作，遇到别人指出“文艺报”应该是思想领导的刊物，是指导文艺思想、文艺运动的刊物的时候，我心里总有些不安，总想不要让“文艺报”戴上这顶帽子。我不问实际上“文艺报”应不应该负指导的责任，而只从个人去想问题，因为戴上这个帽子，责任就更严重了，这是我怕负责任的表现。
    刊物既然是教育群众的，一切问题就要从群众出发，就要同群众联系得好。斯大林同志在一九○一年“斗争报”创刊时的社论中写道：
    报纸最重要的责任——是尽可能接近工人群
    众，尽可能经常影响他们，作为他们自觉的和领
    导的中心。
    并说：
    报刊——这是最有利的武器，在它的帮助之
    下，党每日每时地，用自己的，党所需要的语
    言，来同工人阶级谈话，在党与阶级之间扩展精
    神联系的别的工具，别的类似的灵活的机关，天
    地之间还没有。
    这些话虽然是对政治报纸的估价，实际也完全适用于我们的刊物。联系群众，是刊物的首要的任务。从编辑部里提出来的问题一定要是今天群众所迫切要求解决的问题，也就是在整个政治活动中，和人民生活中一切应该提到思想领域里来的问题，一切生活中新思想和旧观念的交战的问题。譬如还是跟着人民政府走，在工人阶级领导下去从事建设呢，还是跟着反动阶级走，来违反政府政策，反对人民呢？是抗美援朝，保家卫国呢，还是苟且偷安，苟延残喘的个人主义呢？是赞扬武训的奴才思想，还是反对这种违反人民利益的反动思想呢？刊物要发动广大的群众注意这些问题，对这些现实生活中最有意义的思想问题发生兴趣，展开讨论，并且随时注意讨论中的倾向。刊物要根据这些群众的需要组织创作、领导创作；组织批评、展开批评；组织学习，帮助作家去接近生活、接近群众，接触最主要的题材，纠正他们在创作思想、创作方法上错误的观点，引导他们沿着正确的创作道路前进，写出为人民需要的作品来，为群众所欢迎，却又教育群众。
    刊物既然是最集中表现我们文艺工作部门领导思想的机关，是文艺战线的司令台，那末从这里所发出的一切言论，就代表了整个运动的原则性的标准，因此编辑部的负责人和工作人员就不应该是一个普通的看稿人或集稿人。他们就应该具有高度的明确的思想性，最能判断是非轻重，敢于负责地表明拥护什么，鼓吹什么，宣传什么和反对什么，而且是热烈地拥护和坚决地反对。高尔基曾有过这样的话：“编辑是在某种程度上指导作家，教育作家的人。”因此编辑必须比作家知道得多，他是他的第一个读者和批评者，也第一个替作家考虑一篇作品在群众中所将引起的影响，他就应该从刊物的任务，从群众观点来帮助作家，弥补这作品里的某些缺点，提高作品所能起的政治作用，以及作更好的艺术的加工。因此编辑人员首先应该认识这个工作岗位对于国家和人民的重要和责任。应该以能担负这种工作为光荣，而努力地、艰苦地学习，不断地提高自己的马列主义的理论水平、政策思想，及文学艺术的修养；兢兢业业，虚心谨慎地从事日常工作，并且随时加以检查。
    上述的任务，我们的刊物（指全国性的刊物）就没有很好完成。不是说我们的刊物没有起过作用。我们的刊物也曾登载过一些较好的作品，也曾有过一些比较重要的批评。我们的编辑人员中，大部分还是很努力的，想把刊物办好。可是同其它部门工作来比较，却是落在很远的后边。我们没有把两年来伟大的变革和成就很好地反映出来，我们刊物办得不能令人满意。我们经常听到从群众那里来的批评，这原因我们不能不去好好思考一下。
    第一就是我们的刊物本身缺乏思想性，没有明确的方针和任务。拿“文艺报”来说吧，它是全国文联的机关刊物，文联的常委会讨论过为什么要出这样一个刊物么？我知道是没有过的。我接受这个任务时，我得到的指示是“文艺报”是一个会刊，登些指令、号召、决议、各地报告之类的文件，还可以登登工作经验。我个人是不满意这个刊物的性质的，我们几个人依据这个指示，订了一个方针，就是“文艺报是文艺工作与广大群众联系的刊物，用来反映文艺工作的情况，交流经验，研究问题，展开文艺批评，推进文艺运动”。这个方针，现在看来是极不明确的，任何刊物都可以这样写的。我们究竟以何者为主，而且将文艺运动向哪里推进呢？这个方针发表之后，至今也没有任何人向我们提出质问。第三卷起，“文艺报”又将方针集中到学习与批评方面，但也没有什么人来提出问题，“文艺报”也没有根据这个方针进行深刻的检讨。“人民文学”的发刊词，则更表现了懒于去用思想。它在前边照抄了六条文协的章程，然后说，“如何使它具体化，那就是本刊的责任。”怎样具体化呢？没有说，只把责任又加在大家身上。然后就要各种形式的稿子，对于稿子思想上内容上的标准也没有明确规定，只着重地说：“最后，本刊编辑部有一点意见也要乘这机会奉告文艺界同人。我们觉得编一本杂志，实在也就是一种组织工作。一要善于组织来稿，使杂志内容不单纯，不偏枯；二要善于有计划地邀约作家们写稿，使每期的杂志既能把握我们的文艺工作的中心环节，而又富于机动性。我们希望用了这样的方法，尽可能地把本刊编得活泼、多方面，而又不至于漫无重心。”从这个发刊词里面，我们恰巧找不到这个刊物的重心。文协的常委或编辑部并没有讨论过这作为文协的机关刊物的方针。我也是文协的负责人之一，我就没有关心，好像这只是茅盾同志和艾青同志的事，我到今天才提出来，我就应该在这件事上受到严重的批评。如果再要举例，也可以举“人民戏剧”。这个刊物既没有发刊词，也没有什么编者的话。不过这刊物如果不标明出版年月的话，你简直也可以把它当成过去几年了的旧刊物，找不出有什么时代的特征。其余的例子我就不再详细列举了。我们检查这些领导刊物的思想，的确是不明确，很模糊，丝毫没有一个领导者的感觉和负责者的态度。军队里打仗，指挥部应该做些什么是很明确的。我想世界上也不能有这样的指挥部，指挥员只要打仗却不做作战计划，不下命令，没有战线，甚至没有明确的敌人和朋友。假如有，这样的指挥部，那也只会是吃败仗的。
    思想性不够，任务不明确，目标不明确，已经很难办了，可是我们又都喜欢办刊物（地方上也是一样，哪个地方有几个能写写文章的人就一定办一个刊物）。一九四九年，胡乔木同志曾提议“文艺报”和“人民日报”的“人民文艺”合并，我坚持不同意；一九五○年胡乔木同志又提议减少刊物，我同意了，可是剧协、美协、音协的负责人又不同意，强调有他们的读者和需要。刊物一多，稿件就分散了。我们之中能做点研究工作写写文章的人本来是不多的，加之刊物分工不明确，一篇稿子既可以在这个刊物上登，也可以在那个刊物上登，于是编辑部有计划地组织稿件就增多了困难，就不得不降低稿子的水平。有三篇好稿子的时候，舍不得一次刊用，留下一篇到下一期吧，那末就放进去几篇不十分好的，或者是不一定要登的稿子了。这样，如何能提高我们的刊物的质量呢？
    我们刊物的质量是不够高的，在那一个刊物上都可以找到可有可无的文章。“文艺报”就常有一些不必要的批评，或者在批评文字中有不恰当的态度或措辞。“人民文学”虽然也登载了一些较好的作品，但同时也登载了一些不好的作品，如“我们夫妇之间”、“烟的故事”等；“说说唱唱”也登载了像“金锁”那样歪曲了劳动人民的作品。这些都是已经被群众指摘出来了的，但至今我们也还没有看到那个刊物深入的检查一下。我们怎么会登载这些作品的呢？我们为什么会欢喜这些作品，而且要向读者去推荐这些作品呢？
    其次，刊物的负责者没有足够的责任感。我们听到一些编辑人员不安心工作的呼声，一些牢骚，很少听到自我批评与积极的想办法。因为对群众负责的责任心低，就不会很关心群众，就失去从群众那里来的政治敏感，取舍稿件也就不是根据一定的政治要求，而是根据个人的欣赏水平和兴趣，甚至有的负责人连稿子的最后审阅都不能完全做到。这不是很危险的吗？我以为编辑人员没有责任感，经常对工作采取敷衍的态度，这应该作为劳动纪律的问题来看，应该认为是失职行为，一定要进行严格的批评。编辑组织稿件也不是有计划的。有的完全不去组织，坐在办公室等稿件。有的编辑部随便找些人担任编辑，过一个时候开一次会，会上不讨论什么问题，只分摊几篇稿子，也不管被分摊者有无写作的条件。主编出题目，也只是灵感式地临时想出来的。结果被分摊的稿子常常是交不了卷。交不了卷我以为也没有什么，因为这样不是按需要和能力分派的稿子，并不一定就能写好。编辑不是万能的作家，什么问题都可以写的；如果有这种万能的编辑，自以为什么都精通，实际上一定是什么也不精通的。
    再呢，就是刊物的负责者缺乏自我批评，也害怕批评，不喜欢听批评的意见。如果有人对他编的刊物中的任何文章提出意见，他就把你往无原则的人事关系上扯，说你对他们有成见，或你这个集团对他那个集团有问题。这样做不过为的使提意见的人不敢再提，为了使人不愿纠缠在人事关系中而把口封住。“文艺报”是一个批评刊物，不免对某些文章有些批评，就遇到过这种情形。我有时是坚持了，有时也就向这种情况投降。我曾经很痛苦过，为了怕得罪了朋友，就宁肯不向群众负责。我把朋友看得比群众重要，把个人的烦恼看得重要，我是一个胆小的个人主义者！我很喜欢日丹诺夫所引的那段斯大林的话，我不妨引用一下引起我们警惕：
    如果我们要保存干部，要教育和培养他们，我们
    就不应当害怕得罪什么人，就不应当害怕进行原
    则性的、大胆的、坦白的和客观的批评。没有批
    评，任何的组织，连文学组织也在内，是会腐朽
    的。没有批评，任何的病是会深入膏肓和难于医
    治的。只有大胆和直率的批评，才会帮助我们的
    人们改善，才会鼓舞他们前进，克服自己工作的
    缺点。那里没有批评，那里腐臭和停滞就会生
    根，那里就没有前进的余地。斯大林同志还屡屡指出：
    我们发展的最重要的条件，就是每个苏维埃人
    必需每天总结自己的工作，无所畏惧地检查自
    己，分析自己的工作，勇敢地批评自己的缺点和
    错误，深思熟虑怎样使自己的工作达到更好的成
    绩，并且为改善自己而不间断地工作。这一点适用
    于文学家，正如适用于其他任何工作人员一样。
    谁害怕批评自己的工作，谁就是卑劣的胆小鬼，
    就不配受到人民的尊敬。
    这些指示，应当成为刊物编辑的座右铭！
    还有些刊物的领导人及编辑人员，在某些时候，其思想远远落后于群众的思想斗争的实际。如“说说唱唱”第十八期上登了一篇“‘武训’问题介绍”，“人民日报”已经发表了有关“武训传”的社论，“武训传”的讨论已经热烈地展开，群众正在激愤地批评的时候，那里却来了一个纯“客观”的介绍，可见编辑者对于正在展开的对“武训传”的讨论的意义毫不理解，也说明了编者自己的思想混乱。
    个别的刊物还有小集团倾向。譬如“人民戏剧”的头几期，就用了许多篇幅来登主编人的作品。后来“人民戏剧”主编换了中央戏剧学院的人，则又大半是戏剧学院同志的稿子了。有一件我认为最不好的，就是当中央戏剧学院同志们创作的几个短剧
    （“母亲的心”，“人民的意志”等）上演时受到了一些批评，这些批评是正确的，并不过份，但中央戏剧学院创作室的领导人和“人民戏剧”的主编人却写了一篇捧这三个短戏的文章在“人民戏剧”上发表。后来这位主编的同志虽然作了检讨，却不深刻。他为什么利用主编地位随便发表这样的文章呢？
    此外，大家知道，“光明日报”的“文学评论”和“新民报”的“文艺批评”的编辑态度，也是不严肃的。
    虽说如此，但我相信我们的刊物是可以办好的。为了加强我们的刊物，首先是应该依靠文学艺术团体的领导和它的活动。文联其所领导的各个协会在领导文艺工作时应该对刊物加以密切的注意，使刊物成为团结群众、团结作家的中心，成为批评与自我批评的中心，做到以党和人民政府的政策去教育群众，鼓励群众向为人民服务的崇高品质的目标前进。这一次全国文联调整刊物的决定是正确的。全国文联发动的这次整风学习将是我们刊物的一个转机，我们的编辑人员，大部分都是希望把刊物办好的，那末也将在这一次学习中深刻地来检查本身的缺点，克服它，纠正它，订出新的计划来，认真地工作。
    创作和批评是可以组织的，过去我们也组织过，但因为方针不明确，组织的稿子便不是在很好的计划中的。从我们的经验中，也知道比较有组织的稿子，是群众需要的稿子，是可以得到较多和较好的反映的。稿件的能否组织，依靠编辑部工作的是否主动，编辑部应该经常召集一些作品的座谈会，一些问题的座谈会，编辑部应该收集研究一些存在的问题，将资料供给作家，并且帮助作家下乡、下厂、下部队，帮助他们写作。编辑部是组织者，却不是只顾自己写作的人，编辑部的人员动了，开动了脑筋，作家们也就跟着动了，问题也就活动起来，文章就多了。文章多，思想讨论活跃，这样编刊物才有意义。编辑部不怕没有稿子，就怕自己不主动。我们的群众是积极的，我们文章中的一些大小错误，都是首先被读者指出来的。群众的眼睛是最亮的，依靠着群众，是最好的办法。随时随地记着群众，记着马列主义，那是无往而不胜利的。
    同志们，努力吧，我们有这样多的读者，有这样多的作家，我们的国家已经走上一个光辉灿烂的时代，我们有毛主席和中国共产党的思想领导，我们一定可以办好我们的刊物，毋负于我们的光荣任务和伟大的时代。同志们，努力吧，好好学习，为提高我们刊物的政治性、思想性、战斗性而斗争吧！
