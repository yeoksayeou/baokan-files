    Introducing the "Northeast Industry" Magazine

    The "Northeast Industry" magazine, compiled by the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, is a good publication for introducing the experiences of industrial construction in Northeast China.

    "Northeast Industry" was founded on August 1, 1949, and is published on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month. It has now published seventy-seven issues. The first characteristic of "Northeast Industry" is its close integration with practical work, accurately and promptly reflecting the actual situation of industrial construction in Northeast China. It not only publishes policies and regulations related to industrial construction but, more importantly, focuses on the central tasks of industrial construction in each period, promptly exchanging and disseminating practical work experiences. Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working class of Northeast China has demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and has created and continues to create many valuable experiences. Through "Northeast Industry," we can systematically learn from the experiences of industrial construction in Northeast China, and these advanced experiences have important reference value for industrial and mining enterprises in other parts of the country.

    Systematically introducing the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union according to the needs of current work is the second characteristic of "Northeast Industry." For example, in 1949 and 1950, when industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China launched the movement to create new records, "Northeast Industry" introduced Stalin's speech at the First All-Soviet Stakhanovite Workers' Conference and articles on advanced Soviet experiences such as "Experiences of Workshop Directors" and "Principles of Socialist Industrial Management." During the increase production and practice economy movement, "Northeast Industry" continuously introduced Soviet articles such as "Quality First" and "New Forms of Organizing the Masses to Participate in the Struggle for Economy." In order to promote the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in practical work, "Northeast Industry" widely introduced the dissemination of advanced Soviet experiences in Northeast China's industrial construction, and organized administrative management cadres and technical personnel from various factories and mines to introduce their心得 (xīn dé: what one has learned) from studying advanced Soviet experiences. This systematic and guided method of learning from advanced Soviet experiences is completely different from those intermittent and fragmented learning methods. In terms of promoting advanced experiences, "Northeast Industry" has set a good example of combining theory with practice.

    The inaugural message of "Northeast Industry" emphasized the need to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to criticize the shortcomings and errors in Northeast China's industrial and mining construction. "Northeast Industry" has always grasped this weapon and has made good achievements. This is its third characteristic. "Northeast Industry" has continuously exposed the phenomenon of waste in industrial construction, exposed the phenomenon of irresponsibility in work, promoted the quality mass inspection movement in various factories and mines, and guided various factories and mines to establish a system of responsibility. "Northeast Industry" not only exposed the shortcomings and errors in Northeast China's industrial construction, but more importantly, pointed out the direction of improvement and the path forward.

    In order to promote the increase production and practice economy movement that is being carried out throughout the country, it is necessary to universally promote various advanced experiences and criticize various errors and shortcomings in industrial construction work. The experience of industrial construction in Northeast China is worth learning by leading cadres of enterprises across the country. "Northeast Industry" magazine is a very valuable publication in this regard.

专栏：

    介绍“东北工业”杂志
    东北人民政府工业部编的“东北工业”杂志，是介绍东北工业建设经验的好刊物。
    “东北工业”在一九四九年八月一日创刊，每月一日、十一日、二十一日出版。现已出版了七十七期。“东北工业”的第一个特点，是和实际工作紧密结合，正确、及时地反映了东北工业建设的实际情况。它不仅刊载了有关工业建设的政策和法令，更重要的是围绕每一时期的工业建设中心，及时交流与传播了实际工作的经验。两年多来，东北工人阶级在共产党领导下，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，已经创造了和正在继续创造着许多宝贵的经验。通过“东北工业”，我们可以系统地学习东北工业建设的经验，这些先进经验，对于全国其他地区的工矿企业，都有重要的参考价值。
    有系统地而且按照当前工作的需要，介绍苏联的先进经验，这是“东北工业”的第二个特点。例如，一九四九年和一九五○年，东北工矿企业开展创造新纪录运动时，“东北工业”介绍了斯大林在第一次全苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者会议上的演说，和苏联先进经验“车间主任经验谈”、“社会主义工业管理原则”等文章。在增产节约运动中，“东北工业”连续介绍了苏联的“质量第一”、“组织群众参加节约斗争的新形式”等文章。为了把苏联的先进经验推广到实际工作中去，“东北工业”广泛地介绍了苏联先进经验在东北工业建设中传播的情况，并组织各厂矿的行政管理干部及技术人员，介绍自己学习苏联先进经验的心得。这种有系统地、有领导地学习苏联先进经验的方法，和那些时断时续、零零碎碎的学习方法，是完全不同的。在推广先进经验方面，“东北工业”树立了一个理论与实践相结合的良好的榜样。
    “东北工业”的发刊词中，曾强调提出：要以批评与自我批评的武器，批判东北工矿建设中的缺点和错误。“东北工业”一直掌握着这个武器，并且作出了较好的成绩。这是它的第三个特点。“东北工业”曾经不断揭发工业建设中的浪费现象，揭发工作中无人负责的现象，推动了各个厂矿的质量大检查运动，和指导各厂矿建立了负责制。“东北工业”不仅揭发了东北工业建设中的缺点和错误，更重要的是指出了改进的方向和前进的道路。
    为了推动正在全国范围内开展着的增产节约运动，必须普遍推广各种先进经验，批判各种在工业建设工作中的错误和缺点。东北工业建设的经验，是值得全国企业领导干部学习的。“东北工业”杂志在这一方面是很有价值的刊物。
