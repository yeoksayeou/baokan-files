Shijingshan Power Plant workers in Beijing are launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to create an additional one hundred tons of millet worth of wealth for the country before the end of the year.

The Shijingshan Power Plant workers completed their production tasks for the second half of the year by the end of October. On November 13th, after Liu Dezhen, a national model worker attending the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, conveyed Chairman Mao's call for increased production and practicing economy at the plant, the plant director, Liu Yingyuan, proposed a plan to complete increased production and practice economy worth one hundred tons of millet before the end of the year. This plan received a response and support from all the workers. The plant's trade union also organized the workers to conduct research and put forward effective methods to achieve this increased production and economy plan: (1) In terms of leveraging the potential of equipment and saving electricity consumption in the plant: Si Wenshun's team in the electrical field proposed repairing the magnetic excitation of a certain generator itself; Liang Fengchang's team proposed increasing output while maintaining a certain fineness of coal grinding; Cai Xuecheng's team in the turbine field proposed adjusting the use of large and small water pumps according to load changes; many teams proposed replacing large motors with small motors, reducing the number of circulating water pumps opened in cold weather, and not operating coal mills when the load is high to reduce peak loads. Implementing these methods can save the country a lot of electricity every month. (2) In terms of improving technology, improving combustion, and reducing costs: the three high-pressure furnace teams proposed to further adjust ventilation and test burning inferior coal (stone coal), burning 15 tons more inferior coal per day, which can save 37.5 tons of millet by the end of the year; workers in the coal pulverizer operating shift 3 proposed to increase the combustion ratio of hard coal and bituminous coal to 9.4 to 0.6 without affecting safe power generation, which can save 8 tons of millet by the end of the year; the lathe team in the repair shop implemented high-speed cutting methods, increasing work efficiency by a quarter. The above can save more than 40 tons of millet in total. (3) In terms of practicing strict economy, restoring old machines, and reducing the plant's overall management costs: Liu Dezhen's team proposed accurately calculating materials and using old materials to make deaerators, which can save more than two tons of millet; the electrical field workers planned to repair two old motors and one transformer in stock. In management, methods such as restricting the misuse of cars and long-distance calls are adopted to prevent waste and reduce expenses.

Currently, all the workers in the plant are full of confidence and are working hard in all aspects to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy of one hundred tons of millet before the end of the year. In order to reduce costs, the plant's technical personnel have gone deep into the field and are studying methods of trial burning inferior coal with the workers. On November 23rd, the ratio of hard coal to bituminous coal in the coal pulverizer had reached 9.7 to 0.3, approaching the level of using all hard coal. (Xinhua News Agency)

    石景山发电厂职工决在年底前
    多增产一百吨米财富
    北京石景山发电厂职工开展增产节约运动，争取年底以前再为国家创造一百吨小米的财富。
    石景山发电厂职工十月底就完成了今年下半年的生产任务。十一月十三日，列席中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的全国劳动模范刘德珍在厂里传达了毛主席增产节约号召后，厂长刘英源提出年底以前完成增产节约价值一百吨小米财富的计划，得到全体职工的响应和支持。该厂工会并组织职工进行研究，提出实现这个增产节约计划的有效办法：（一）在发挥设备潜在能力、节省厂用电方面：电气场司文顺小组提出修好某发电机本身的厉磁；梁凤昌小组提出在保持磨煤一定细度下提高产量；汽机场蔡学成小组提出根据负荷变动调换使用大小水泵；许多小组提出把大马达改成小马达，天冷少开循环水泵，负荷大时不开磨煤机，减少尖头负荷。实行这些办法，每月可以为国家节省许多电力。（二）在提高技术、改进燃烧、降低成本方面：高压炉三个小组提出要进一步调整通风，试烧劣煤（石头煤），每天多烧十五吨劣煤，到年底就可节省三十七点五吨小米；煤粉炉运转三值的工人提出在不影响安全发电下，把硬煤和烟煤燃烧比例提高到九点四比零点六，到年底可省八吨小米；修理场车工小组实行高速切削法，提高工作效率四分之一倍。以上共可节约四十多吨小米。（三）在厉行节约、恢复旧机、减少全厂管理费用方面：刘德珍小组提出准确计算材料和利用旧料来做除氧器，可节省两吨多小米；电气场工人计划修复库存的旧马达两台、变压器一台。在管理上则采取限制汽车和长途电话的滥用等方法，防止浪费，减少开支。
    现在，全厂职工满怀着信心，正从各方面来为实现年底以前增产节约一百吨小米而努力。为了降低成本，该厂技术人员都深入了现场，和工人研究试烧劣煤的方法，十一月二十三日，煤粉炉硬煤和烟煤的比例已达到九点七比零点三，接近全部用硬煤的程度。（新华社）
