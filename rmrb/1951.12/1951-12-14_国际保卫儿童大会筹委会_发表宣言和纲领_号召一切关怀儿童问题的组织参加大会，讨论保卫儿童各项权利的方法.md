Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 7th: The preparatory committee for the International Conference for the Defense of Children, to be held in Vienna next April, has been established in Paris. The committee is composed of representatives from thirty-eight countries, including prominent educators, doctors, writers, and social leaders from various nations. The committee has issued a declaration and a program. The declaration states: We are filled with anxiety about the threats to the lives of countless children today. In capitalist countries, many children do not receive adequate food because of the frenzied arms race; in colonial countries, millions of children die of starvation; and in Korea, hundreds of thousands of children have died from bombing, hunger, and cold due to American aggression. To defend children—humanity's most valuable asset—we call on all kind men and women, and all organizations concerned with child issues, to participate in the International Conference for the Defense of Children to discuss methods for protecting children's rights, lives, health, and right to education.
    The program issued by the preparatory committee is as follows:
    “Protect the lives and health of children threatened by another war. Guarantee them the food, living conditions, and medical care necessary for their development. Give every child the opportunity to study and receive vocational education. Protect children from the influence of poisonous literature, immoral radio broadcasts, and movies, and organize beneficial entertainment for them.
    Actively engage in activities to eliminate juvenile delinquency, and thoroughly study the problem of educating unattended children.
    Seek solutions to the problem of abandoned and homeless children, especially children in colonial and dependent countries.
    Oppose the exploitation of child labor and improve legislation on this issue.
    Educate children in the spirit of democracy and international friendship.
    Only through the joint efforts of people who care about the lives and well-being of children can we ensure that children live healthy and active lives in a peaceful environment.”

    国际保卫儿童大会筹委会
    发表宣言和纲领
    号召一切关怀儿童问题的组织参加大会，讨论保卫儿童各项权利的方法
     【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎七日讯：将在明年四月在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会的筹备委员会已在巴黎成立。委员会由三十八个国家的代表组成，包括各国著名的教育家、医生、作家和社会领袖。委员会发表了宣言和纲领。宣言说：我们对今天无数儿童生命所受的威胁充满了忧虑。在资本主义国家，因为疯狂备战，许多儿童得不到充足的食物；在殖民地国家，千万儿童死于饥饿；在朝鲜更有几十万儿童由于美国的侵略死于轰炸和饥寒。为了保卫儿童——人类最宝贵的财产，我们号召一切善良男女，关切儿童问题的一切组织来参加国际保卫儿童大会，讨论保卫儿童的权利、生活、健康和受教育的权利的方法。
    筹备委员会发表的纲领如下：
    “保护受另一次战争的威胁的儿童的生命和健康。保证给与为他们的发育所必需的食物、生活条件和医疗。给与每一儿童以研究和受职业教育的机会。保护儿童不受有毒的文字、不道德的无线电广播和电影的影响，并为他们组织有益的娱乐。
    积极从事消灭儿童犯罪行为的活动，彻底研究教育无人照管的儿童的问题。
    寻求解决被抛弃的和无家可归的儿童的问题的方法，特别是在殖民地国家和附属国内的儿童。
    反对剥削童工，改善关于这一个问题的立法。
    用民主和国际友好的精神教育儿童。
    只有凭着关心儿童的生命和福利的人们的共同努力，才能保证儿童们在和平环境中过着健康的积极的生活。”
