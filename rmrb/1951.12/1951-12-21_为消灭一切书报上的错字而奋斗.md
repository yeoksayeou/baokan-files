Reader's Letter:

    Strive to Eliminate All Typographical Errors in Books and Newspapers
    Editor: I believe that we should not only strive to eliminate typographical errors in newspapers, but also strive to eliminate typographical errors in all books, periodicals, internal publications, promotional materials, and even book catalogs.
    I recently saw two relatively serious errors: On page 465 of the "Learning Dictionary" compiled by the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office of Beijing Normal University, in item (7) of the "Essential Reading for Cadres" section, the quotation marks around "Left-Wing" in Lenin's famous work "'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder" were omitted, and the author of the book was mistakenly attributed to Engels. The Beijing Branch of Xinhua Bookstore compiled and printed a comprehensive book catalog in May of this year, and there were errors on almost every page. I myself found more than 300. I think this situation is serious.
    Why do errors frequently occur in books, periodicals, and newspapers? I think the main reason is ideological. If we do not attach importance to it ideologically, errors are inevitable. Take proofreading as an example. Some people think that proofreading is a "purely technical problem." Therefore, some departments often transfer comrades with low skill levels or who are not suitable for "major" work to do proofreading work, and even set the salaries of comrades who do proofreading work particularly low. Furthermore, some people think that newspapers have tens of thousands of words every day, so how can we guarantee that there will not be a single error? The implication is that readers should forgive a few errors in newspapers. All of the above ideas ignore the political nature and importance of proofreading work, and therefore should be thoroughly corrected.
    Recently, the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was published, and there was not a single typographical error in it. This powerfully illustrates that as long as the staff are conscientious and responsible, and treat their work seriously, it is not impossible to eliminate typographical errors.
    I hope that the leadership of national books, periodicals, and newspapers will all attach importance to editing and proofreading work. Editorial and proofreading staff, in addition to improving their language proficiency and professional skills, and overcoming a careless work style, must first of all attach importance to editing and proofreading work ideologically, establish a working attitude of being responsible to readers for every word and sentence, thoroughly correct erroneous understandings, and resolutely strive to eliminate all typographical errors in books, periodicals, and newspapers!

### 为消灭一切书报上的错字而奋斗

    为消灭一切书报上的错字而奋斗
    编辑同志：我以为我们不但应该为消灭报纸上的错字而奋斗，而且应该为消灭一切书籍、期刊、内部刊物、宣传品，甚至图书目录上的错字而奋斗。
    我最近看到两处比较严重的错误：北京师范大学中国大辞典编篡处编的“学习辞典”第四六五页“干部必读”项中的第（七）项，把列宁的名著“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”，漏掉了左派两个字上的‘’，并把这本书的作者错为恩格斯。新华书店北京分店在今年五月份编印了一本综合性的图书目录，几乎每一页都有错误，只我自己发现的就在三百个以上。我觉得这种情况是严重的。
    书刊报纸为什么会经常发生错误呢？我以为主要是思想问题。思想上不重视，错误一定难免。就拿校对来说，有人认为校对是“纯技术问题”，因此有的部门时常把水平低、不适宜担任“重头”工作的同志，调作校对工作，甚至把作校对工作的同志的待遇定得特别低；更有人认为报纸每天都有几万字，怎能保证每天不错一个字呢？言外之言，就是认为报纸上即使错几个字，读者也应该原谅。以上这一切想法，都是忽视了校对工作的政治性和重要性，因此是应该彻底纠正的。
    最近“毛泽东选集”出版了，里面一个错字都没有，这就有力地说明了：只要工作人员认真负责，严肃地对待工作，消灭错字并不是不可能的。
    我希望全国书刊报纸的领导方面，都对编校工作重视起来。编辑校对工作同志，除了提高语文水平、业务水平，克服粗枝大叶的作风以外，首先必须从思想上重视编校工作，建立一字一句都对读者负责的工作态度，彻底纠正错误认识，坚决为消灭一切书刊报纸上的错字而奋斗！
