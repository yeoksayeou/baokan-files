State-Owned Trading Departments in Jiangxi Province
Saving on Commodity Circulation Costs

The state-owned trading departments in Jiangxi Province saved 20.2 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs in the first half of this year. This was due to the following factors:

(1) In reducing commodity circulation costs, they actively improved allocation routes and implemented direct transportation. For example, the salt originally transported by the Salt Company through Nanchang to Ji'an and Ganzhou was rerouted through Zhangshu, saving an estimated 1.076 billion yuan annually. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company established a transfer station in Zhangshu, rerouting yarn and cloth that originally went through Nanchang, saving approximately 1 billion yuan per year. The adjustment of transportation routes narrowed regional price differences for commodities. Taking the price adjustment of East China yarn and cloth on April 1st as an example, based on the Nanchang price adjustment ratio (cotton yarn increased by 14.39%, long-staple fine cloth by 10%), the actual price reduction in Ganzhou was 150,000 yuan per piece of yarn and 16,000 yuan per bolt of cloth. This not only benefited consumers but also expanded yarn and cloth sales and saved on commodity circulation costs.

(2) Improving business management and accelerating capital turnover. The state-owned trading departments in Jiangxi Province emphasized planning in transportation, striving to ship goods as soon as they arrived, avoiding warehousing to save on handling labor. At the same time, they adopted the method of selling goods locally to reduce transportation costs. In changing transportation tools, they generally switched from trucks to ships and civilian boats to save on freight. For example, the Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company plans to switch from truck to ship transportation for yarn and cloth shipped to Ji'an and Ganzhou this year, saving 700 million yuan in freight. At the same time, they implemented quota management, improving work efficiency. For example, the daily salt handling capacity per scale at the Ganzhou Salt Branch increased from 1,200 dan to 1,990 dan, with a record high of 2,267 dan.

(3) Attaching importance to warehouse protection work, reducing commodity losses. The Provincial Grain Company launched a labor emulation campaign, greatly reducing storage losses. After sun-drying, the company's grain stocks generally had their moisture content reduced to the safe storage standard of 14%. The storage and transportation loss rates of various warehouses have also been reduced. The storage loss rate of rice was only 0.0134%, and that of polished rice was only 0.0048%; the transportation loss rate was 0.8% for rice and 0.2% for polished rice, all far below the quota.

(4) Expanding sales and purchases and accelerating capital turnover. Various specialized companies actively handled slow-selling and inventory goods. For example, some inventory goods of the department store company were difficult to sell in Jiujiang, so they proactively transferred them to Nanchang for promotion.

    江西省国营贸易部门
    节省商品流转费
    江西省国营贸易部门，今年上半年节省商品流转费用二百零二亿元。原因是他们做到了以下各点：
    （一）在减低商品流转费用中，积极地改进了调拨路线，实行了直达运输。如盐业公司原经过南昌转运到吉安、赣州两地去的盐，改由樟树转运，全年可节省费用十亿七千六百万元。花纱布公司在樟树设立转运站，原经南昌运的纱布改由樟树转运，一年约可节省费用十亿元。运输路线的调整，缩小了商品的地区差价。以四月一日华东纱布价格调整为例，以南昌调价比例（棉纱提升百分之十四点三九，龙头细布百分之十）计算，赣州每件纱价实降低十五万元，每匹布价格降低一万六千元。这不仅照顾了消费者，且扩大了纱布销路，节约了商品流转费用。
    （二）改善经营管理，加速资金周转。江西省国营贸易部门，在运输上强调计划性，争取货物随到随运，不落仓库，以节省搬运力资。同时采取商品就地出售的办法，减免调运费用。在改换运输工具上，一般都由汽车改用轮船、民船运输，以节省运费。如省花纱布公司今年计划调往吉安、赣州二地纱布，由汽车改用船运，节省运费七亿元。同时试行了定额管理，提高了工作效率。如赣州盐业支公司每天每秤收放盐由一千二百担提高至一千九百九十担，最高纪录达二千二百六十七担。
    （三）重视护仓工作，减少了商品的损耗。省粮食公司展开了劳动竞赛，大大减低了保管损失。该公司存粮经翻晒后，水分普降到百分之十四的安全保管标准。各仓库保管及运输损耗率也降低，稻谷的保管损耗率只达万分之一点三四，大米只达万分之零点四八；运输损耗：稻谷为千分之八，大米为千分之二，都远在定额之下。
    （四）扩大购销额，加速了资金周转。各专业公司积极处理冷背货及库存货。如百货公司一部分库存货在九江不好销，就主动地调往南昌推销。
