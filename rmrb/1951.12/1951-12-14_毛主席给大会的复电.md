To the Comrade Representatives of the Northwest Nationalities' Anti-American Aid Korea Representative Conference: Thank you for your telegram to me. In the past year or so, the people of all nationalities in the Northwest region have made great efforts and achieved great results in the patriotic struggle against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. Your representative conference has decided to further unite the people of all nationalities, increase production, practice strict economy, and carry out patriotic propaganda and education to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is very good. One of the reasons why imperialism dared to bully China in the past was the disunity of all nationalities in China. However, this era is over forever. From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, all nationalities in China began to unite into a friendly and cooperative family, which is enough to defeat any imperialist aggression and build our motherland into a prosperous and strong country. I wish your conference success!

　　Mao Zedong, December 12th

    毛主席给大会的复电
    西北各族人民抗美援朝代表会议全体代表同志们：感谢你们给我的电报。过去一年多以来，西北区各族人民在抗美援朝的爱国斗争中，作了很大的努力，得到了很大的成绩。你们的这次代表会议，决定进一步团结各族人民，增加生产，厉行节约，开展爱国主义的宣传教育工作，以支持中国人民志愿军，这是很好的。帝国主义过去敢于欺负中国的原因之一，是中国各民族不团结，但是这个时代已经永远过去了，从中华人民共和国成立的那一天起，中国各民族就开始团结成为友爱合作的大家庭，足以战胜任何帝国主义的侵略，并且把我们的祖国建设成为繁荣强盛的国家。祝你们的会议成功！
　　毛泽东十二月十二日
