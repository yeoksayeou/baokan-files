    No Tax Evasion Allowed
    In our people's country, paying taxes is a glorious obligation of the people. Because paying taxes is to support the revolutionary war and build our great motherland. Many industrialists and businessmen recognize this point, and they are very active in paying taxes, truly fulfilling their due, and also glorious, obligation.
    However, there are also many industrialists and businessmen who have not fulfilled their obligations. They try every possible means to evade taxes, causing serious losses to the state. In East China, nearly 30 billion yuan of tax evasion cases were uncovered in eight months. This is an extremely harmful habit.
    The People's Government does not oppose industrialists and businessmen making profits, and it adopts various policies to ensure that industrialists and businessmen obtain legitimate profits. However, the People's Government and the broad masses of the people resolutely oppose the illegal acts of certain industrialists and businessmen who, driven by the idea of ​​profiteering, undermine state taxation. It is entirely necessary to launch an anti-tax evasion movement in many areas. In order to eliminate the illegal behavior of private industrialists and businessmen in evading taxes, tax departments and industrial and commercial departments in various places should extensively explain the significance of taxation to taxpayers, and call on taxpayers to pay taxes in accordance with regulations. Those who evade taxes should be punished in accordance with regulations. This is the only way to plug the loopholes in evading state taxes. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement carried out across the country, all industrialists and businessmen should be informed that tax evasion and bribery are often inseparable and are both shameful criminal acts. They should be called upon to confess voluntarily, correct this illegal behavior, and at the same time mobilize the masses to report them. In the first half of this year, more than 570,000 tax evasion cases have been uncovered in various places, which proves that with the assistance of the people, the People's Government has a way to eliminate the phenomenon of tax evasion.

    不许偷税漏税
    在我们人民的国家里，纳税是人民光荣的义务。因为纳税是为了支援革命战争，建设我们伟大的祖国。不少工商业者认识了这一点，他们在纳税中表现很积极，确实尽了应尽的、同时也是光荣的义务。
    但是也有不少工商业者，没有履行自己的义务。他们千方百计地偷税、漏税，给国家造成严重的损失。华东地区八个月查获的偷漏税案件中，偷漏税款近三百亿元。这是极端有害的恶习。
    人民政府并不反对工商业者获得利润，而且采取种种政策，保证工商业者获得正当的利润，但是，人民政府和广大人民坚决反对某些工商业者在暴利思想支配下的破坏国家税收的违法行为。很多地区展开了反偷漏税运动，是完全必要的。为了肃清私营工商业者偷税漏税的非法行为，各地税务部门和工商部门，应该广泛地向纳税人讲清楚纳税的意义，号召纳税人照章纳税。对偷税漏税者照章加以惩处。这样才能堵塞偷漏国家税款的漏洞。在全国范围内开展的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，应该向所有工商业者说明，偷税漏税和行贿常常是不可分的，并且都是可耻的犯罪的行为。应该号召他们自动坦白，纠正这种违法的行为，同时发动群众检举。今年上半年各地已经查获了五十七万多件偷税漏税案件，这就证明在人民群众的协助之下，人民政府完全有办法能够消灭偷漏税的现象。
