	Deepen the Movement, Continue to Advance!
	——Summary of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Degeneration, and Anti-Bureaucracy Struggle in Songjiang Province (Abstract)
	Zhang Ce, Secretary of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
	The anti-corruption, anti-degeneration, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Songjiang Province has been underway for nearly two months in the units directly under the province and all units in Harbin, and has generally started in all counties in mid-November. This movement is being carried out under the correct leadership of the Northeast Bureau and Comrade Gao Gang. As of now, we have achieved great results and important experiences, which create good conditions for further deepening this movement and launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy.
	(I) Achievements and New Atmosphere Obtained After the Movement Was Launched

	This anti-corruption, anti-degeneration, and anti-bureaucracy movement in our province has basically formed a mass democratic movement. In the movement, resolute struggles have been waged against various erroneous ideas, and thus a new atmosphere has emerged in various units. This can be seen from the following five aspects:
	1. Improved the ideological level of leading cadres. This movement has made many leading cadres in various units realize the seriousness of their own bureaucracy. In the past, the leading cadres of the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives unconditionally trusted the four section chiefs of a certain department, and repeatedly affirmed that there were no problems with these people, but the fact was just the opposite. All four section chiefs had very serious problems. A long time ago, the masses were dissatisfied with the leadership, but the leadership thought that the masses had prejudices against them. In this movement, the leading cadres of the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives truly realized the consequences of not approaching the masses, not listening to their opinions, and not understanding the ideological situation of the cadres. They conducted self-criticism and widely solicited opinions from the masses, which is a new atmosphere in terms of democratic life. In addition, many units have inspected and criticized the phenomenon of not going deep into their work, and immediately changed their work style. Taking the Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions as an example, from the responsible cadres of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to the cadres of various industrial trade unions, they have initially formulated plans to go deep into the grassroots trade unions to help with their work, and have begun to implement them. In the past, some cadres only felt that the enthusiasm of the cadres was not high, the work efficiency was low, and the work could not be promoted, but they did not know where the problem was. Through this movement, everyone clearly saw that there were various loopholes in the use of personnel, systems, and ideological education; at the same time, they thoroughly understood the ideological situation of each cadre, which made it easy to grasp the key problems and propose improvement methods, thus increasing the confidence in improving future work. It is precisely because a fierce ideological struggle was launched in the movement, the masses boldly criticized the leadership, and everyone met ideologically and exposed the impropriety of certain departments in promoting cadres, that the leadership also understood what kind of cadres should be promoted to important positions, which further rectified our cadre policy. In addition, the achievements of the movement are also reflected in the fact that arrogant people have become modest, those who focus on routine matters have become clear-headed, and those who neglect politics have become concerned about politics.
	2. Improved the enterprising spirit of cadres and the masses. At the beginning of the movement, those who had not committed corruption said: "Having one more friend means one more path, offending one person means a wall." They held a liberal attitude towards the decadent enjoyment ideas of the exploiting class and the employment concept of the old society. This attitude has been criticized and corrected in this movement; replaced by the sense of ownership of protecting state property and an active and upward-looking ambition. Those who are hardworking and thrifty are not looked down upon, but are considered to be inheritors of the glorious revolutionary tradition. This has greatly improved work efficiency. The Harbin Municipal Taxation Bureau solved the problem of late payment for 1,008 households in five days (most of these people were "old late payers" after liberation), collecting more than 500 million yuan in taxes. No one in the Taxation Bureau felt that "in the past, some speculative merchants attacked us, and we didn't even have the strength to fight back." The current 150 people in the Provincial Department Store are taking on the work of the past 210 people; five section chiefs are doing the work of fifteen section chiefs; in the past, there were four people in the price control section, who could neither go to the countryside nor understand the situation. Now, two people can go to the countryside and solve the problem of price imbalance in some places in a timely manner. The efficiency of telegram translation in the General Office of the Provincial Government has increased by 118%; those who write documents completed two weeks' worth of tasks in five days; lateness, early departure, and things where no one is responsible for work and only cares about life have been reduced. Many people said: "After the movement, all work has improved."
	3. Not only recognized, but also correctly applied criticism and self-criticism. A large number of activists emerged in the movement, some corrupt elements were saved, the prestige of the Party was expanded, the unity within and outside the Party was strengthened, and conditions were created for improving future work and solving the difficulty of promoting cadres. In the movement, most of the leading cadres conducted strict self-criticism, supported the activists, called on corrupt elements to repent and start anew, and timely corrected various deviations and concerns; many corrupt elements confessed their mistakes, some requested punishment and were willing to do a good job; at the same time, the masses of various organs conducted extensive reporting and exposure, and fierce ideological struggles were launched in many meetings, suppressing evil and supporting righteousness; many people boldly criticized the leadership and put forward various methods to improve future work and establish various systems. This not only enabled the leadership to fully understand the situation of each cadre in all aspects, but also provided important conditions for solving the difficulty of promoting cadres in the future due to the emergence of a large number of activists who are loyal to their duties and cherish state property in the movement. Because everyone launched criticism and self-criticism on principled issues and overcame unprincipled disputes, unity was strengthened. A non-Party comrade said with emotion: "From the determination of the leadership and many facts, I have seen that the Communist Party is indeed great!" This proves that through this movement, the Party's prestige among the masses has been further enhanced.
	4. The atmosphere of principles is strong. Before the movement, under the erosion of various bad ideas, a few cadres were indulging in discussions about food, clothing, housing, and transportation all day long, and did not care about political activities; individual units did not implement the donation plans after they were formulated; the relationship between Party members and the masses was not close; some Party members were unwilling to participate in branch work. After the movement started, the situation was completely different: many Communist Party members accepted the opinions of the masses and were able to help non-Party comrades study ideological problems in a timely manner. Many section chiefs in the Department of Culture and Education changed their old habits and participated in various collective mass activities. Some organs revised and inspected the patriotic pacts, re-formulated donation plans, and actively participated in relief donations. The systems that were formulated after everyone's discussion can be earnestly implemented, many leading cadres attach importance to and strengthen political education, and in daily life, everyone is no longer discussing life problems, but ideological problems. The relationship between cadres is much more harmonious than before, and work seems to be more energetic.
	5. Improved the concept of cherishing state property and saved unnecessary expenses. The movement is gradually turning to the aspect of anti-waste. At present, although various organs have not formulated complete systems in all aspects, many organs have already started to reduce expenses due to the exposure of many serious waste phenomena. For example, the expenditure of the Supply Section of the General Office of the Provincial Government decreased by one-third in October compared with September; in the past, when the Management Section repaired some houses or cleaned up some odd jobs, larger jobs were contracted out, and smaller jobs hired workers, while the carpenters, bricklayers, and electricians of the organ only acted as supervisors. Now they do it themselves. In the past, the cadres of the various industrial trade unions in Harbin City had to take a car every time they went to the factory, but now they are unwilling to take it anymore. In addition, there have also been gains in strictly implementing account audits, reducing non-system expenses, etc. Everyone is paying attention to reducing waste. In this way, the movement will naturally be directed to opposing various wastes.
	(II) The Basic Situation of the Current Movement
	Although a new atmosphere has emerged in each unit, the depth of the movement varies. At present, there are roughly three situations:
	The first type: The leadership has the determination to regard this movement as the most effective way to improve work, recognizes the importance of mobilizing the masses, and thus strictly conducts criticism and self-criticism, and fully promotes democracy. In these units, various concerns are quickly eliminated, and the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle is improved. The intentions of the leadership are quickly combined with the enthusiasm of the masses, so that corrupt elements have neither the possibility of hiding nor the opportunity to take advantage of loopholes, and they dare not openly resist. They can only confess and turn back. In addition, with everyone's exposure and reporting, problems can be quickly exposed and certain cases can be clarified, and the movement can be continuously deepened. The aforementioned new atmosphere is particularly prominent in these units.
	The second type: There are gains of varying degrees, but there is also a "half-baked" state of varying degrees. The law shown in the movement process is: the masses put forward an opinion and then move a little, the leading organs inspect once and then move forward a step, pushing and moving, not pushing and not moving, sometimes cold and sometimes hot. Although some units have also had a comprehensive climax, the enthusiasm of the masses is not full enough due to the lack of strong support and promotion from the leadership, and the power of the movement cannot be fully displayed. Therefore, the gains are generally not great. The main reasons for this phenomenon are:
	(1) Some leading cadres do not have enough understanding of the seriousness of the situation in their own units, and treat the movement with a bureaucratic attitude. For example, the responsible cadres of the Northeast Office of China Petroleum Corporation still say: "There is no bureaucracy or corruption in our organ, and 80% of the people have no problems." A certain branch secretary of the Provincial Taxation Bureau said: "It's almost over now." The director said: "You can't let the Provincial Party Committee know what you said."
	(2) The business work and this movement are mechanically opposed to each other, thinking that the business is too busy and there is no time. Although they did not refuse to launch this movement, they actually relaxed their leadership. After the masses rise up, they are ready to end the movement at any time and get through it; or when they encounter certain resistance and deception, they say that there is no problem and "it's almost over." Some units estimate that there may be problems, but due to the lack of belief in the power of the masses and the failure to take resolute measures to mobilize the masses, they lack effective and concrete measures, fear difficulties and do not move forward, and the effect is not great.
	(3) Certain leading comrades are trapped in the circle of vulgar liberalism and treat the movement with this liberal attitude. They talk about personal relationships and trust certain cadres without a principled attitude and without a basis. Therefore, they cannot resolutely conduct struggles in the movement and generate protection in some cases.
	(4) The leading cadres of certain organs have some mistakes themselves, but they do not have the courage to conduct self-criticism. They feel that they are "unreasonable" and dare not come forward. Individually, there are more serious shortcomings, so they take a procrastinating attitude towards the movement, trying to get through it, not daring to seriously mobilize the masses, fearing that they will get burned, and releasing news at any time to demand the end of the movement or to shift the target of the struggle.
	Although these units have made progress of varying degrees under the repeated promotion of the Provincial Party Committee, most of them have not undergone fundamental changes like the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives, and things that resist the movement still occur.
	The third type: Some units have also conveyed the report, conducted discussions, and exposed some problems. The responsible comrades have also made some self-criticism, but the mood of the masses has not changed much, and no new atmosphere has emerged. This is mainly due to the fact that the leading cadres do not attach importance to it, fail to fully mobilize the masses, and fail to launch democratic criticism. They regard leading the movement only as having to carry out official duties.
	This unbalanced phenomenon is an obstacle to deepening the movement and launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and must be overcome. Units in the first category should, on the one hand, organize the strength of the masses to analyze and study the handling of problems; on the other hand, continue to mobilize the masses to launch a more in-depth movement to increase production and practice economy, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy. Mobilize the masses to discuss various systems and block loopholes in the systems. On the basis of overcoming various waste phenomena, formulate plans to increase production and practice economy, and adhere to the democratic system to ensure that these achievements are implemented in daily work, and avoid complacency and the phenomenon of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end. Units in the second category should first correctly estimate the depth of the movement, analyze the causes of the "half-baked" state, improve the understanding of the leading personnel, resolutely mobilize the masses, break the deadlock of the movement, overcome the obstacles of the movement, and enrich the content of opposing waste and practicing economy, and further deeply expose various corruption phenomena, so as to thoroughly improve work and improve leadership style. Units in the third category basically need to re-mobilize, adopt the experience of advanced units, and combine anti-corruption and anti-waste to carry out the campaign, and strive to quickly mobilize the masses in order to catch up. According to the repeated instructions of the Northeast Bureau, the Provincial Party Committee has also made up its mind that this movement cannot be regarded as getting through or a gust of wind, as a general "task" of carrying out official duties. It must achieve practical results. Therefore, this movement must have a beginning and an end. It should be noted that only by vigorously mobilizing the masses can problems be quickly exposed; only by exposing problems can there be concrete steps and methods to correct mistakes.

    深入运动，继续前进！
    ——松江省反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义斗争的总结（摘要）
    中共松江省委书记    张策
    松江省的反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义运动，已在省直属各单位暨哈尔滨市所有单位进行了将近两个月，各县一般地也都在十一月中旬开始。这个运动是在东北局和高岗同志的正确领导下进行的。截至现在止，我们已经获得了很大的成绩和重要的经验，这些成绩和经验，给进一步深入这个运动并为开展增产节约运动，创造了良好的条件。
    （一）运动开展后所获得的成绩
            和出现的新气象
    这次我省的反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义运动，基本上已形成了群众性的民主运动。在运动中，向各种错误思想进行了坚决的斗争，因而在各单位中都出现了新的气象。这可由下列五个方面看出来：
    1、提高了领导干部的思想水平。这次运动，使不少单位的领导干部认识到自己的官僚主义的严重性。过去，合作社省联社的领导干部，对某某四个科长是无条件信任的，而且一再肯定这些人没有问题，但事实恰恰相反，这四个科长全都有很严重的问题；很早以前，群众就对领导方面不满意，而领导方面反以为群众对领导方面有成见。在这次运动中，省联社的领导干部真正认识到不接近群众、不倾听群众意见、不了解干部思想情况的结果是什么了。他们进行了检讨，广泛地征求了群众意见，这就是在民主生活方面的新气象。另有不少单位，检查、批判了工作不深入的现象，立即转变了工作作风。以哈尔滨市总工会为例，从市总工会负责干部到各产业工会的干部，都初步制定了深入基层工会帮助工作的计划，并开始实行。过去，有些干部只是感觉到干部积极性不高，工作效率低，工作推不动，就是不知道毛病出在什么地方。通过这次运动，大家清楚地看到在用人上、制度上、思想教育上都有各种漏洞；同时，彻底地了解了每个干部的思想情况，这就便于抓住关键问题，提出改进办法，因而提高了改进今后工作的信心。正因为在运动中展开了激烈的思想斗争，群众大胆地批评了领导，大家在思想上见了面，揭发了某些部门在提拔干部方面不妥当的地方，所以领导方面也懂得了：应当把什么样的干部提拔到重要的工作岗位上来，这就进一步端正了我们的干部政策。此外，运动的成绩也表现在：自高自大的人变得虚心了，事务主义者清醒了，忽视政治的人关心政治了。
    2、提高了干部和群众的事业进取心。在运动开始时，没有犯贪污错误的人说：“多一个朋友多条路，得罪一个人一堵墙”，对腐朽的剥削阶级的享受思想、旧社会的雇佣观念，抱着自由主义的态度。这种态度在这次运动中受到了批判和纠正；代之而起的是爱护国家财产的主人翁观念，是积极向上的事业心；对于艰苦朴素的人不仅不是看不起了，而且认为是光荣的革命传统的继承者了。这就大大地提高了工作效率。哈尔滨市税务局在五天中解决了一千零八户的迟纳问题（这些人，大都是解放后的“老迟纳户”），收税五亿多元，税务局的干部再也没有人感到“过去某些投机奸商向我们进攻，我们连还手的力量都没有”了。省百货公司现在的
    一百五十个人把过去二百一十个人的工作担当起来；五个科长干了十五个科长的事；过去物价股有四个人，既不能下乡，也不能了解情况，现在两个人也可以下乡，并能及时解决某些地方物价不平衡的问题了。省政府的办公厅，译电效率提高了百分之一百一十八；写文件的在五天中完成了两个礼拜的任务；迟到早退，工作无人负责，只关心生活不关心工作的事情减少了。许多人说：“运动之后，什么工作都有起色了。”
    3、不但认识了，而且正确地运用了批评和自我批评，运动中涌现出大批积极分子，挽救了部分贪污分子，扩大了党的威信，加强了党内和党外的团结，给提高今后工作、解决提拔干部困难创造了条件。在运动中，大多数领导干部都进行了严格的自我检讨，给积极分子撑腰，号召贪污分子悔过自新，及时地纠正了各种偏差和顾虑；许多贪污分子坦白了自己的错误，有的人请求处分，愿意好好地做工作；同时，各机关的群众进行了广泛的检举和揭发，在许多会议上展开了激烈的思想斗争，压倒了邪气，扶植了正气；许多人大胆地批评了领导，并提出了改进今后工作、建立各种制度的各种办法；这不但使领导上充分地了解了每一个干部各方面的情况，而且由于在运动中涌现了大批忠于职责、爱护国家财产的积极分子，这对今后解决提拔干部困难也提供了重要条件。由于大家在原则问题上展开了批评和自我批评，克服了无原则纠纷，因而加强了团结。一个非党同志感动地说：“从领导上的决心和许多事实上，我看到了共产党确实伟大！”这就证明：通过这个运动，党在群众中的威信更提高了。
    4、原则空气浓厚了。运动之前，在各种坏意识的侵蚀下，少数干部终日沉醉在衣食住行的谈论中，不关心政治活动；个别单位订出了捐献计划之后不执行；党员和群众的关系不密切；某些党员不愿意参加支部工作。运动展开之后，情况则截然不同：许多共产党员接受了群众的意见，能及时地帮助非党同志研究思想问题。文教厅的许多科长改变了老习惯，参加了各种集体的群众活动。有的机关修订和检查了爱国公约，重新制定捐献计划，并积极参加救济捐献。对于经大家讨论制订出来的制度能够认真地执行了，不少领导干部重视并加强政治教育了，在日常生活上，大家谈论的不再是生活问题，而是思想问题了，干部相互间较前融洽了好多，工作也显得有生气了。
    5、提高了爱护国家财产的观念，节省了不必要的开支，运动逐步转向反浪费方面。目前，各机关虽未在各方面制定出完整的制度，但由于已经暴露了很多严重的浪费现象，因而许多机关已经着手减少开支。如省政府办公厅供给科的经费开支，十月份比九月份减少了三分之一；过去管理科在修理某些房子或收拾一些零活时，大一些的活包出去，小一些的雇工人，本机关的木匠、瓦匠、电气工只在一旁当监工员，现在都是自己干了。过去哈尔滨市各产业工会的干部，每次下厂都要坐小汽车，现在也不愿意坐了。此外，在严格执行账目的审查、减少非制度开支等等方面，也都有收获。大家都注意到减少浪费。这样，就会自然地将运动引向反对各种浪费方面去。
    （二）当前运动的基本情况
    虽然在每个单位都出现了新的气象，但运动的深度还有程度上的不同。目前，大体有三种情况：
    第一种：领导方面有决心，把这次运动看做是提高工作最有效的办法，认识了发动群众的重要，因而严格地进行了批评和自我批评，充分地发扬了民主。在这些单位中，很快地消除了各种顾虑，提高了群众的斗争积极性；领导方面的意图迅速地和群众的积极性结合起来，贪污分子既无隐蔽的可能也无钻空子的机会，更不敢明目张胆地抵抗，他们只有坦白、回头；再加上大家揭发检举，所以就能迅速地暴露问题并弄清某些案件，不断地使运动深入发展。前述的新气象，在这些单位中是表现得特别突出的。
    第二种：有着程度不同的收获，但也有着程度不同的“夹生”状态。运动过程中所表现的规律是：群众提出一个意见就动一下，领导机关检查一次就前进一步，一推一动，不推不动，时冷时热。有些单位虽也有过全面的高潮，但因缺乏领导上的有力支持和推动，所以群众情绪不够饱满，不能充分地显示出来运动的力量，因而收获一般不大。产生这种现象的主要原因是：
    （1）一部分领导干部对本单位情况的严重性认识不足，以官僚主义的态度对待运动。如中国石油公司东北办事处的负责干部直到现在还说：“我们这个机关没有官僚主义，也没有贪污，百分之八十的人没有问题。”省税务局某支部书记说：“现在差不多了。”局长说：“这样说，可不能让省委知道。”
    （2）把业务工作和这次运动机械地对立起来，认为业务太忙，没有时间，虽然没有拒绝开展这个运动，但实际是放松领导。群众起来后就表现为随时准备结束运动，过关了事；或是在遇到某些抵抗和蒙蔽时，便说没有问题了，“差不多了”。有的单位，估计也可能有问题，但由于不相信群众力量，不采取坚决发动群众的办法，因而缺乏有效的具体办法，畏难不前，效果不大。
    （3）某些领导同志陷于庸俗的自由主义思想圈子中，并以这种自由主义态度来对待运动，他们讲私人情面，以非原则的态度无根据地信任某些干部，因而在运动中不能坚决地进行斗争，并在某种情况下产生包庇现象。
    （4）某些机关的领导干部自己有某种错误，但没有勇气进行自我批评，自己觉得“理屈”不敢出头。个别的则有较严重的缺点，因而对运动采取拖延态度，企图过关，不敢认真发动群众，害怕惹火烧身，并随时放出空气，要求结束运动，或转移斗争目标。
    这些单位，虽然在省委历次推动下都有程度不同的进步，但大多数还没有像省联社那样根本的转变，抵抗运动的事情仍然发生。
    第三种：有些单位也传达了报告，进行了讨论，也暴露了一些问题，负责同志也作了某些方面的检讨，但群众情绪没有什么变动，没有出现什么新的气象。这主要是由于领导干部不重视，未能充分发动群众，未能展开民主批评所致。他们把领导运动只是看作不得不奉行公事而已。
    这种不平衡现象，都是深入运动并开展增产节约运动的障碍，必须加以克服。处在第一类情况的单位，一方面应组织群众力量分析研究处理问题；一方面应继续发动群众更深入地开展增产节约、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动。发动群众讨论各种制度，堵塞制度上的漏洞。在克服各种浪费现象的基础上，制订增产节约计划，并坚持民主制度保证这些成绩贯彻到日常工作中去，切忌自满和前紧后松的现象。处在第二类情况的单位，应当首先正确估计运动的深度，分析“夹生”的原因，提高领导人员的认识，坚决地发动群众，打开运动僵局，克服运动的障碍，并充实反对浪费、厉行节约的内容，进一步深入揭发各种贪污现象，这样才能彻底改进工作，改进领导作风。处在第三种情况的单位，基本上要重新进行动员，采用先进单位的经验，把反贪污反浪费结合起来进行，争取很快地将群众发动起来，以便迎头赶上。根据东北局历次的指示，省委也下了决心，不能把这次运动当作过关或一阵风，当作一般奉行公事的“任务”，一定要求得实效，因而这次运动一定要有始有终。应该注意只有大力发动群众，才能迅速地暴露问题；只有暴露了问题，才会有改正错误的具体步骤和办法。
