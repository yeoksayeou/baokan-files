The struggle against corruption and degeneration, in terms of its ideological nature, is a struggle of the working-class ideology armed with Marxism-Leninism against feudal and capitalist ideologies, and it must thoroughly defeat them. Therefore, in the struggle against corruption and degeneration, it is necessary to correct various erroneous thoughts that hinder the development of this struggle, in order to draw a clear ideological line. This is of great significance both for educating and saving certain corrupt elements and, in particular, for raising the awareness of all staff members. Doing a good job of ideological work in the struggle against corruption and degeneration can make this struggle have a profound effect and lay a foundation for future regular anti-corruption struggles, so that, as Stalin taught us, "an atmosphere of general moral resistance and hatred of the surrounding masses is created around these thieves."

Corruption and degeneration are ugly characteristics unique to the exploiting classes. Therefore, no exploiting class in history has been able to seriously oppose corruption and degeneration, only the working class can resolutely oppose corruption and finally completely eliminate it. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "Revolutionaries of all ages, before their revolution and themselves have succeeded and won, still represent the demands of the progressive oppressed masses, and can maintain their original revolutionary qualities, but once the revolution and their personal victory and success are achieved, few do not become corrupt, bureaucratic, and degenerate, lose their revolutionary and progressive nature, and become obstacles to revolution and social evolution. ... Because these revolutionaries of the past all represented classes that exploited others, once their revolution was successful, they would turn around to oppress the exploited masses and become obstacles to the continued progress of the revolution and social evolution. Therefore, it has become an inevitable law that revolutionaries of all ages become corrupt, bureaucratic, and even degenerate after the victory and success of the revolution, losing their revolutionary nature. However, this situation can never and will never be the case for our Communist Party. Because we represent the proletariat, which is completely exploited and does not exploit others, it can carry the revolution through to the end, completely liberate all mankind, completely eliminate all corruption, bureaucratism, and degeneration from human society, and establish a party and state apparatus with strict organizational discipline to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against all corruption, bureaucratism, and degeneration, and constantly cleanse those who have become corrupt, bureaucratic, and degenerate in their work from the party and state apparatus (no matter how ‘great’ these elements are), and maintain the purity of the party and state apparatus. This characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary party is something that no revolutionary party in the past had, nor could have." The Chinese people's great revolution has been victorious, and the Chinese Communist Party has become the party in power throughout the country. In order to consolidate victory and develop victory, we must maintain the purity of our revolutionary ranks organizationally and ideologically, and the struggle against corruption and degeneration is to achieve this goal.

However, with the victory of the revolution, our ranks have expanded unprecedentedly, and a considerable number of personnel whose ideology has not been thoroughly transformed have joined the work in various fields, and after entering the cities, the influence of various non-proletarian factors has also increased. In this situation, some people in our ranks who have not yet determined their revolutionary outlook on life and those who are ideologically unswerving have succumbed to various reactionary influences and engaged in corrupt behavior, and are spreading some erroneous ideas, which are constantly eroding our revolutionary ranks organizationally and ideologically.

In order to maintain the purity of our ranks organizationally and ideologically, we must unfold the struggle against corruption and degeneration very seriously. In order to develop and deepen this struggle, we must first thoroughly shatter the erroneous ideas that give rise to corruption and degeneration and disregard the serious harm of corruption and degeneration.

The first erroneous idea is: believing that the Chinese revolution has been victorious and has entered the cities from the countryside, one should strive for sophistication in life (and this so-called sophistication is actually to make one's life like that of landlords and the bourgeoisie), otherwise it is so-called "rural viewpoint"; believing that the style of hard struggle is only suitable for the difficult environment of the past, and it is not timely to promote it again today.

This idea is wrong, first of all because it distorts the meaning of the great transformation from the countryside to the city. The main content of this transformation is: 1. Requiring that the focus of the Party's work be shifted from the countryside to the city, with the city as the center, and carrying out work with the perspective of urban-rural mutual assistance and urban-rural integration. 2. Requiring that we must make great efforts to learn to lead the urban people in victorious struggles; learn to manage and build cities, and the central key is to rely on the working class, speed up the restoration and development of industrial production, and turn consumer cities into productive cities. Only in this way can we play the role of cities leading the countryside, thereby consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship. 3. Requiring the centralization and unification of various tasks, opposing laxity and looseness; requiring the scientification of various tasks, strengthening efficiency, and emphasizing accuracy. In short, the Chinese revolution has entered the cities from the countryside, and the tasks have become more arduous, not lighter. As Chairman Mao said, "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to be idle, and some of the things we are unfamiliar with are forcing us to do." "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we don't understand." It can be seen that it is an extremely wrong idea to understand that entering the cities from the countryside means striving for sophistication in life, and not knowing the extremely serious tasks before us.

Secondly, this idea is wrong because it understands the valuable quality of hard struggle that revolutionaries must possess as outdated and not needing to be permanently maintained and carried forward. The cause we are engaged in is an unprecedentedly great cause in human history, to transform the world and liberate all mankind. Overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, although is an unprecedentedly great victory in Chinese history, compared with our lofty ideals, as Chairman Mao said, "It's just like finishing the first step of the Long March." The new tasks before us are more complex and arduous. Therefore, the style of hard struggle is not only needed for us in the past, but especially needed now and in the future. In his reply to all circles in Yan'an on October 26, 1949, Chairman Mao issued a great call: "And I hope that all revolutionary workers in the country will always maintain the style of hard struggle that the staff in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have had in the past ten years or so." Maintaining and carrying forward our glorious tradition, we can overcome various difficulties and complete various tasks. On the contrary, if we relax our fighting spirit, disarm our thoughts, and lose our glorious tradition because the Chinese revolution has won the cities, and we are determined to pursue personal enjoyment, then we will lose the valuable qualities of the revolution and let the reactionary influence of landlords and the bourgeoisie swallow ourselves, and the consequences will be very dangerous.

The second erroneous idea is: believing that now that production has developed and people's living standards have generally improved, it is not too much to "enjoy" a little.

Indeed, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and thanks to the concerted hard work of the vast majority of cadres and all the people, after several years of economic construction in the Northeast, production has developed rapidly and people's living standards have also improved significantly. Under the premise of improving people's living standards, the lives of our staff members should also be improved to a certain extent, which is reasonable.

However, the problem is not here, but in how much improvement and how to seek improvement.

All revolutionary staff members are servants of the people. Therefore, the degree of improvement in the lives of revolutionary staff members must be adapted to the degree of improvement in the lives of the people. If it exceeds the degree of improvement in the lives of the people, it is incorrect. More importantly, this improvement must be uniformly stipulated by the state, and no one is allowed to raise their living standards without authorization, let alone steal state property to satisfy personal desires. Whoever does so is undermining the laws and disciplines of the state and is not tolerated by national law.

Some people think that the money is earned by him, and he has the right to enjoy it first; some people think that he has experienced the arduous period of the revolution, and now that the revolution has been victorious, he has merit, "even if there is no merit, there is hard work", and he should enjoy it; some people think that he is using the money produced by his own agency and has not used state property, so it doesn't matter if he spends more. All these views are obviously very wrong. It is right for a revolutionary to work hard for the people's cause, which is a responsibility that must be fulfilled to realize his lofty ideals. And the achievements created by anyone are a small part compared with the great revolutionary cause, and should not be complacent in the slightest, let alone use this as an excuse to demand excessive rewards from the revolution. Glory belongs to the Party and belongs to the people. Without the strength of the Party and the people, no one can accomplish anything by himself. State property and all property of revolutionary organizations are the property of the people, and no one is allowed to use it privately, otherwise it is embezzlement and perversion of the law, which is to undermine revolutionary interests. Everyone has the responsibility and the right to expose and oppose this kind of embezzlement and perversion of the law, and the government must give it the punishment it deserves.

We should also see that there are extremely arduous and extremely heavy tasks in front of our national construction cause. At present, our country is still an agricultural country, and it will take long-term hard work to achieve industrialization. Our country is still under the threat of aggression from the imperialist group headed by US imperialism, and our national defense still needs to be further consolidated. The lives of the Chinese people have only begun to improve, and more improvements must be gradually sought from the development of production. Especially important is that the highest goal of our Communists' struggle is to realize the most beautiful and happiest living system for mankind in China, that is, to realize socialist-communist society. All this is not demanding that we should work harder, but instead allowing us to talk about personal enjoyment? Every revolutionary staff member must work better for the country, cherish state property more carefully, and use every useful penny of the country for the most urgently needed cause, and must not have the slightest waste, let alone embezzle or steal on any excuse. Whoever steals or embezzles state property is helping the enemy and becoming a sinner of the revolution. Although there is a difference in the amount of embezzlement, and the degree of crime is different, the fundamental nature of undermining the revolutionary cause is the same.

The third erroneous idea is: in principle, it is admitted that the various systems stipulated by the state should be observed, but it is believed that they should not be mechanically observed. Therefore, he observes what is beneficial or harmless to him, and he does not observe what is detrimental to him, but destroys it, and euphemistically calls it "flexible", saying "has the courage and can do things".

It should be admitted that this erroneous idea of treating the work system is not only an excuse for corrupt elements to carry out their criminal activities, but also exists among some of our confused working cadres. It creates a loophole that allows corrupt elements to drill around and get what they want, and cannot be discovered and punished in time. This is precisely a manifestation of the bureaucratic style of work that we want to oppose.

How should we view our various work systems correctly?

The system is the state's regulations and the concrete discipline of the revolutionary ranks. It has binding and mandatory properties. Once stipulated by the state, every staff member must resolutely abide by it, and the leaders should especially take the lead and become an example of observing the system. The system does not allow "flexibility", otherwise it is equivalent to no system, or it only constrains others, and has nothing to do with oneself. Of course, due to changes in objective conditions, the system stipulated according to past conditions should also be changed, but it must be changed or approved by the leading agency that originally stipulated the system, and subordinates are never allowed to change it casually, otherwise it is an act of disorganization and indiscipline. As for using the destruction of the system to satisfy personal desires, it is obviously a serious illegal act, which is not allowed by the state's laws and disciplines. Revolutionary staff members strictly abide by various systems, which is by no means mechanical in dealing with problems, but a due disciplinary spirit, a noble quality that must be possessed, and a concrete manifestation of loyalty to the revolutionary cause. There will never be such a person who arbitrarily destroys various systems on the one hand, and can wholeheartedly serve the people on the other hand.

In the past, due to the laxity of the system, corrupt elements had an opportunity to take advantage of it, and now it has reached the time to fundamentally change this state. The various harmful views on observing the system have now also reached the time to be thoroughly clarified. In the current struggle against corruption, we must earnestly check the implementation of our various systems, expose the bureaucratic style of work in this regard, and at the same time, according to the results of the inspection, establish various work systems more strictly.

The fourth erroneous idea is: to regard corruption as just a small matter of life, as if it has little relationship with the revolutionary cause and does not damage revolutionary interests.

Our Communists and revolutionary staff members have lofty political ideals and a great political mind, and are always paying attention to our revolutionary tasks, and will never haggle over small matters of life. We believe that if we only haggle over small matters of life, it is not only useless but also harmful to the revolutionary cause. However, is corruption a small matter of life? No, absolutely not. Stealing the property of the people and the state into one's own hands and using it to satisfy one's own despicable personal desires is directly undermining revolutionary interests, eroding the revolutionary forces from within the revolutionary ranks, undermining the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses of the people, and a reactionary act that the revolutionary cause cannot fundamentally tolerate. If it is allowed to develop without being thoroughly eradicated, it will lead the revolutionary cause to failure. This is such a serious matter, which is related to the success or failure of the revolution, how can it be lightly said to be a small matter of life? How can we turn a blind eye to it and not resolutely oppose it?

Opposing corruption is absolutely not haggling over small matters of life, but seriously safeguarding revolutionary interests, in order to maintain the purity of the revolutionary ranks organizationally and ideologically. Someone said that this solemn struggle is narrow-minded in dealing with things and lacks the spirit of a statesman. If he is not deliberately slandering, his thinking has degenerated to an unimaginable level.

The struggle against corruption must be combined with the struggle against extravagance and waste. Often people know to hate corruption, but they do not know how to resolutely oppose waste. In fact, the losses caused by extravagance and waste to the country may be greater than the losses caused by corruption. Although extravagance and waste and corruption are different in nature, from the results they produce, they are both damaging to the revolutionary cause. Therefore, we must oppose corruption and waste. Various wasteful phenomena may exist in our various agencies and departments. It is even more necessary for every staff member to be active and responsible to expose, oppose, and eliminate it. Without the enthusiasm of the broad masses, it is difficult to eradicate wasteful phenomena from every corner.

Our revolutionary staff members must deeply understand that every point of state property that is embezzled and wasted reduces the strength of national construction and resistance to the US and aid to Korea; conversely, every point of state property that is saved and maintained increases the strength of national construction and resistance to the US and aid to Korea. Therefore, not only should those who embezzle and waste repent and confess their past sins to the state, and express their determination to reform, but every staff member should enthusiastically participate in this solemn struggle, with a high degree of responsibility to the people, expose and report various corruption and waste phenomena, and should not adopt a bystander attitude, thinking that he is not corrupt or wasteful, and he can be considered innocent, and adopt a liberalist spirit of protecting himself, and let it be. If so, it is irresponsible to the people and has not fulfilled the duties of a revolutionary. The liberalist attitude will undoubtedly seriously hinder the struggle against corruption, and we must resolutely overcome this harmful attitude.

Shattering the various absurd excuses of corrupt elements, correcting the erroneous views and bystander attitudes of some people, will make the struggle against corruption fully unfold and achieve satisfactory results.

    纠正反贪污斗争中的几种错误思想（东北日报社论）
    反对贪污腐化的斗争，按其思想性质来说，是马克思列宁主义所武装的工人阶级思想对封建主义和资本主义的思想作斗争，并且要彻底战胜它。因此，在反对贪污腐化斗争中，必须纠正障碍这一斗争开展的各种错误思想，以划清思想的界线。这对教育和挽救某些贪污腐化分子来说，特别对提高全体工作人员的觉悟来说，都是有重要意义的。把反对贪污腐化斗争中的思想工作做好了，就能使这一斗争得到深刻的效果，并为今后进行经常的反对贪污腐化斗争打下这样一种基础，像斯大林所教导我们的：“就是在这些贼周围造成一般道德抵制及周围群众憎恨的气氛。”
    贪污腐化是剥削阶级所特有的丑恶。因此，历史上没有任何一个剥削阶级能够认真地反对贪污腐化，只有工人阶级才能坚决地反对贪污腐化，并最后把它完全肃清。刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”中说：“历代的革命者，在革命和他们自己尚未成功与胜利的时候，他们还代表着进步的被压迫群众的要求，还能保持他们原来的革命的品质，但
    一到革命及他们个人胜利与成功之后，就少有不腐化、官僚化与堕落的，失去他们的革命性与进步性，而成为革命与社会进化的障碍物。……因为过去的这些革命者，都是代表剥削别人的阶级，所以在他们的革命一经成功之后，他们就要反转头来压迫被剥削的群众，而成为革命继续前进与社会进化的障碍物。所以历代的革命者，在革命胜利与成功之后，要腐化、官僚化以至堕落，失去他们的革命性，就成了一种必然的规律。然而，这种情形，对于我们共产党来说，无论如何不能、也不会是这样。因为我们所代表的是完全被剥削而不剥削别人的无产阶级，所以它能使革命进行到底，完全解放全人类，完全从人类社会中最后清除一切腐化、官僚化与堕落现象，能够建立有严格组织纪律的党及国家机关，来和一切腐化、官僚化与堕落现象进行不调和的斗争，不断从党内与国家机关中清洗那些已经在自己的工作中腐化、官僚化与堕落的分子出去（不管这种分子是怎样的‘伟大人物’），而保持党与国家机关的纯洁。无产阶级革命党中的这一特点，是历代革命党中所没有的，而且也不能有的。”中国人民大革命胜利了，中国共产党已经成为执掌全国政权的党。为了巩固胜利，发展胜利，就必须从组织上、思想上保持我们革命队伍的纯洁，反对贪污腐化斗争就是为了达到这个目的。
    但是，随着革命的胜利，我们队伍空前地扩大了，有相当数量的思想上未经彻底改造的人员参加了各方面的工作，而在进入城市以后，各种非无产阶级的影响也加多了。在这种情况下，我们队伍内部的一些还没有确定革命人生观的人和思想不坚定的人，就受不住各种反动的影响，而发生了贪污腐化行为，并且散布着一些错误的思想，正在组织上和思想上不断侵蚀我们的革命队伍。
    为了从组织上和思想上保持我们队伍的纯洁性，我们必须十分严肃地展开反对贪污腐化的斗争。为了这一斗争的开展和深入，就要首先彻底粉碎产生贪污腐化和漠视贪污腐化的严重危害的错误思想。
    第一种错误思想是：认为中国革命胜利了，由乡村进入了城市，就应当在生活上力求讲究（而这种所谓讲究实际就是要把自己的生活向地主、资产阶级的生活看齐），否则就是所谓“农村观点”；认为艰苦奋斗作风，只适于过去的困难的环境，而今天再来提倡它，就是不合时宜了。
    这种思想所以是错误的，首先因为它曲解了由乡村进入城市这种巨大转变的涵义。这种转变的主要内容是：一、要求把党的工作重心由乡村转到城市，以城市为中心，以城乡互助和城乡结合的观点来进行工作。二、要求必须用极大的努力去学会领导城市人民进行胜利的斗争；学会管理城市和建设城市，而其中心关键是依靠工人阶级，加紧恢复和发展工业生产，把消费城市变为生产城市。这样才能发挥城市领导乡村的作用，从而巩固作为人民民主专政基础的工农联盟。三、要求各种工作的集中统一，反对松懈散漫；要求各种工作科学化，加强效率，讲求准确。总之，中国革命从乡村进入了城市，任务更加繁重了，不是减轻了。正如毛主席所说的：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”由此可见，把由乡村进入了城市，了解为生活上要力求讲究，而不知摆在面前的极为严重的任务，是极端错误的思想。
    其次，这种思想所以是错误的，因为它把革命者必须具备的艰苦奋斗的宝贵品质，了解为已经过时了，而不需永久保持和发扬。我们所从事的事业，是人类历史上空前伟大的事业，要改造世界，要解放全人类。打倒了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，虽然是中国历史上空前伟大的胜利，但是比起我们的远大理想来，正如毛主席所说：“只不过像万里长征走完了第一步。”摆在我们面前的新任务是更复杂更艰巨。因此，艰苦奋斗的作风，不仅为我们过去需要，而现在和将来尤其需要。毛主席在一九四九年十月二十六日给延安各界的复电中，曾经发出一项伟大的号召：“我并且希望，全国一切革命工作人员永远保持过去十余年间在延安和陕甘宁边区的工作人员中所具有的艰苦奋斗的作风。”保持和发扬了我们这种光荣传统，我们就可以克服各种困难，就可以完成各种任务。反之，如果因为中国革命取得了城市，就松懈了自己的斗志，解除了自己的思想武装，丢掉了自己的光荣传统，而一心去追求个人享受，那就是失掉了革命的宝贵品质，让地主、资产阶级的反动影响吞没自己，其结果是非常之危险的。
    第二种错误思想是：认为现在生产发展了，人民生活普遍提高了，应当“享受”一下，也不算过分。
    不错，由于毛主席和党中央的正确领导，由于绝大多数干部和全体人民的一致辛勤努力，东北经过几年来的经济建设，生产有了迅速的发展，人民生活也有了显著的改善。在人民生活改善的前提之下，我们工作人员的生活也应当有一定的程度的改善，这是合理的。
    但是，问题不在这里，而在于改善到什么程度和如何求得改善。
    一切革命工作人员，都是人民的勤务员。因此，革命工作人员生活改善的程度，必须与人民生活改善的程度相适应，如果超过了人民生活改善的程度，就是不正确的。而更重要的，这种改善必须由国家统一规定，不允许任何人擅自提高自己的生活标准，更不允许任何人以窃取国家的财产来满足个人的私欲。谁那样作了，谁就是破坏国家的法纪，为国法所不容。
    有人以为钱是他赚来的，他有权首先享受；有人认为他经历了革命的艰巨时期，今天革命胜利了，他有功劳，“即使没有功劳，也有苦劳”，他应当享受了；有人认为他用的是本机关生产来的钱，并没有动用国家的财产，因而多花一些没有关系。所有这些观点，很明显是十分错误的。一个革命者为人民事业出力效劳是应当的，这是为了实现自己所抱负的远大理想必须尽到的责任。而任何人所创造的成绩，比起伟大的革命事业来说，都是微小的一部分，丝毫也不应居功自傲，更不应以此为藉口来向革命要求过多的报酬。光荣是属于党，属于人民的。没有党和人民的力量，凭着个人，决不能完成任何一件事业。国家的财产和革命组织的一切财产，都是人民的财产，绝不允许任何人私自动用，否则就是贪污枉法，就是破坏革命利益。对于这种贪污枉法的行为，人人有责任有权利来检举，来反对，政府须给以应得的处罚。
    我们更应看到：我们的国家建设事业面前还放着极为艰巨和极为繁重的任务。现在，我们的国家仍然是个农业国，要达到工业化还需要作长期的艰苦的努力。我们的国家还受着以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团侵略的威胁，我们的国防还有待于更进一步的巩固。中国人民的生活仅是开始改善，还必须逐步地从发展生产中求得更多的改善。尤其重要的是，我们共产党人奋斗的最高目标，是要在中国实现人类最美满最幸福的生活制度，即实现社会主义——共产主义社会。所有这些，不是正要求我们应更加刻苦努力，难道反而允许我们来谈什么个人享受吗？每一个革命工作人员，必须更好地为国家工作，更认真地爱护国家财产，把国家每一分有用的钱都用到最急需的事业上去，不得有丝毫的浪费，更不得以任何藉口来贪污窃取。谁盗窃贪污国家财产，谁就是帮助了敌人，而成为革命的罪人。尽管贪污有多少之分，犯罪程度有大小之别，而其破坏了革命事业这一根本性质则是相同的。
    第三种错误思想是：原则上也承认国家规定的各种制度应当遵守，但是认为不应机械遵守。因此，有利或无害于他的，他就遵守，不利于他的，他就不遵守而加以破坏，并且美其名曰“机动灵活”，曰“有气魄，会作事”。
    应当承认，这种对待工作制度的错误思想，不但是贪污腐化分子进行其犯罪活动的藉口，即是在我们某些头脑糊涂的工作干部中间，也存在着这种错误思想。它造成一个漏洞，使得贪污腐化分子可以钻来钻去，得其所哉，而不能被及时发现和及时受到处罚。这正是我们所要反对的官僚主义作风的一种表现。
    怎样看待我们各种工作制度才是正确的呢？
    制度是国家的法规，是革命队伍的具体的纪律。它具有约束性和强制性，既经国家规定之后，每一个工作人员都必须坚决遵守，而领导人尤其要以身作则，成为遵守制度的表率。制度不允许“机动灵活”，否则就等于没有制度，或者成为只约束别人，而与自己不相干。当然，由于客观情况变化了，根据过去情况规定的制度也应当改变，但是必须经过原规定制度的领导机关来改变或批准，绝不允许下级随便改变，否则就是无组织无纪律行为。至于用破坏制度来满足个人私欲，更显然是严重的犯法行为，为国家法纪所不能容许的。革命工作人员严格遵守各种制度，绝不是处理问题机械，而是应有的纪律精神，是必须具备的高贵品质，是忠实于革命事业的具体表现。绝不会有这样一种人，他一方面任意破坏各种制度，而另一方面还能忠心耿耿地为人民服务。
    过去由于制度不严，使贪污腐化分子有了可乘之机，现在已经到了根本改变这种状态的时候了。在遵守制度上的各种有害观点，现在也到了彻底澄清的时候了。在目前反对贪污腐化斗争中，必须切实检查我们各种制度执行的情况，揭发这方面的官僚主义作风，同时根据检查的结果，把各种工作制度更严格的建立起来。
    第四种错误思想是：把贪污腐化看成只是生活小节，似乎它和革命事业没有多大关系，也并不损害革命利益。
    我们共产党人和革命工作人员，是有远大政治理想与伟大政治襟怀的，时刻注视着我们的革命任务，绝不斤斤计较生活小节。我们认为如果只计较生活小节，对于革命事业说来，不但无益，而且有害。但是，贪污腐化是生活小节吗？不是的，绝对不是的。把人民和国家的财产，窃取到自己的手里，用来满足个人卑鄙的私欲，这是直接破坏革命利益，是从革命队伍的内部来腐蚀革命的力量，是破坏党和政府与人民群众的联系，是为革命事业根本不能容许的反动行为。如果任其发展而不彻底加以根除，就会把革命事业引向失败。这是何等严重的事情，关系着革命的成败，怎么能轻轻地说成是生活小节呢？我们怎么能听之任之而不坚决反对呢？
    反对贪污腐化，绝对不是计较生活小节，而是严肃地维护革命利益，是为了从组织上、思想上达到保持革命队伍的纯洁性。有人把这种庄严的斗争，说成是缺乏政治家气魄的处事狭隘，他如果不是故意诬蔑，也是思想已经堕落到不堪设想的地步了。
    反对贪污腐化的斗争，必须和反对铺张浪费的斗争结合起来。往往人们对贪污知道憎恨，而对于浪费则不知坚决反对。事实上，铺张浪费对国家所造成的损失，可能更大于贪污所造成的损失。铺张浪费和贪污腐化，虽然性质上有所不同，而从其产生的结果来看，则都是损害革命事业的。因此，我们要反对贪污，也要反对浪费。各种浪费现象，可能在我们各个机关、各个部门中间都存在，揭发它、反对它、肃清它，就更需要每一个工作人员的积极性和责任心。如果没有广大群众的积极性，就难以从每个角落里把浪费现象根除。
    我们革命工作人员，必须深刻了解，多贪污浪费国家一分财产，就是减弱了国家建设和抗美援朝的一分力量；反之，多节省和维护国家的一分财产，就是为国家建设和抗美援朝增加一分力量。因此，不仅贪污浪费的人，应当翻然悔悟，向国家坦白过去的罪过，表示自己改过自新的决心，而且每一个工作人员，都应该热烈地参加这一严肃的斗争，以对人民的高度负责精神，揭发检举各种贪污浪费现象，不应抱着旁观者的态度，以为自己不贪污不浪费，就可算是问心无愧，对贪污浪费现象采取明哲保身的自由主义精神，听之任之。如果这样，就是对人民不负责任，就没尽到一个革命者应有的职责。自由主义态度，无疑地会严重妨害反对贪污的斗争，我们必须坚决克服这种有害的态度。
    粉碎了贪污腐化分子的各种荒谬的藉口，纠正了某些人的错误观点和旁观态度，才会使得反对贪污腐化的斗争充分展开，并且收到圆满的效果。
