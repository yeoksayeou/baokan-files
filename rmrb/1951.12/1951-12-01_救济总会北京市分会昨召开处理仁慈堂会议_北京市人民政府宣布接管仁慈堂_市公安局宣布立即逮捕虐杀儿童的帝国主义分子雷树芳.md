Xinhua News Agency, 30th — The meeting for handling Ren Ci Tang, organized by the Beijing Branch of the China People's Relief Association, was held today. Those attending included Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the Commission for Handling and Accepting American-Subsidized Relief Organizations of the Government Administration Council; Kang Keqing, Secretary-General of the National Committee for the Protection of Children of China; representatives from the Beijing Municipal People's Government, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life; representatives from the Beijing Catholic Reformation Movement Promotion Committee; and children, workers, and nuns from Ren Ci Tang, totaling over one thousand people. At the meeting, representatives of the Beijing Municipal People's Government accepted the unanimous request of representatives from all walks of life and announced the takeover of Ren Ci Tang. Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau announced the arrest of Lei Shufang (a French nun), the former director of Ren Ci Tang and an imperialist element, for abusing and killing Chinese children. After the meeting began, representatives of the children from Ren Ci Tang took the stage to indignantly denounce the crimes of the imperialist elements in persecuting them. The first child to take the stage, Mi Minhua, burst into tears after only saying one sentence. She said with tears in her eyes, "During the Japanese occupation of Beijing, foreign nuns forced her to help the Japanese play mahjong. It was winter, and the mahjong tiles had to be soaked in cold water, causing her hands to become swollen and frostbitten. When she was twelve years old, the nuns made her kneel and scrub the floor in winter, and her legs became disabled from the cold." She also tearfully recounted how her mother was abused to death by Lei Shufang and others in the hall. At this point, hundreds of children in the audience were also crying. The second child to speak was Hu Mujia, who stood in front of the microphone and looked like a little girl of only eight or nine years old, but was actually fifteen years old. During her eight years at Ren Ci Tang, she had been beaten unconscious several times by foreign nuns, sent to a disabled persons' home, and subjected to various threats and enslavement, which led to her suffering from lung disease and other illnesses. The third girl to speak was Lin Wucai, who attended the meeting despite being ill. She angrily denounced, "In the year she was nineteen, Beijing was liberated. The 'grand aunts (i.e., nuns)' deceived them by saying, 'When the Communists come, the older girls will be taken out and distributed.' As a result, 30% of the girls over fifteen years old in Ren Ci Tang were forced into marriage. Lin Wucai was also married off by the orphanage. On the night of the wedding, she learned that the groom was an idiot. She lived in this idiot's house for eleven months before running away because she could not bear the suffering." Lin Wucai said, "Now I fully recognize the ugly face of the imperialist elements. From now on, I will resolutely participate in the struggle against imperialism." At this time, the hundreds of children in the audience stopped crying and shouted slogans such as "Down with imperialism."
	Cui Dayang, a female worker from Ren Ci Tang who had struggled to adulthood through numerous hardships, walked to the stage with her disabled legs and exposed the heinous crimes of foreign nuns burying children alive. She had been forced by foreign nuns to bury children alive twice. Zhou Haichuan, a representative of the families of the victimized children, also took the stage to denounce the crimes of the imperialist elements. At this time, the indignation of the entire audience reached its peak. The children and representatives from all walks of life shouted slogans such as "Demand that the People's Government punish Lei Shufang," which lasted for a long time. Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately took the stage and announced: "The People's Government firmly supports everyone's demands, will immediately arrest the imperialist element Lei Shufang, and will promptly interrogate and punish her according to the law." Thunderous applause and cheers immediately erupted in the audience.
	Following this, speeches were given by Kang Keqing, Secretary-General of the National Committee for the Protection of Children of China; Zhang Yingkui, Chairman of the Beijing Catholic Reformation Movement Promotion Committee; Liu Qingyang, Vice-Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation; Chen Mingde, representative of the democratic parties; and Pu Huaru, Deputy Secretary-General of the China People's Relief Association. They all pointed out the crimes of imperialism using religion to invade China and expressed their firm support for the demands of the children and workers of Ren Ci Tang. In their speeches, Kang Keqing and Liu Qingyang particularly emphasized that Chinese mothers should unite with mothers all over the world to jointly protect the peaceful and happy lives of their children and wage a resolute struggle against the evil imperialism.
	Amidst warm applause, Cheng Ruchang, a young pioneer who had presented flowers to Chairman Mao on "July 1st" this year, took the stage to speak. She warmly said to the children of Ren Ci Tang, "Children, I hope you will also quickly join us, let us work hard together to study and live a happy life together!" The children of Ren Ci Tang cheered and shouted, "We will study hard!" "We will be good children of the new China!"
	Finally, Dong Ruqin, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, announced on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government the formal takeover of Ren Ci Tang. She encouraged all the children in the hall to study hard under the education of the People's Government and become good children of the new China.

    北京市人民政府宣布接管仁慈堂

    【新华社三十日讯】中国人民救济总会北京市分会负责筹备的处理仁慈堂会议今日举行。到会的有政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会秘书长伍云甫，中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会秘书长康克清，北京市人民政府、各民主党派、各人民团体和各界人民代表，北京市天主教革新运动促进委员会代表以及仁慈堂儿童、工人、修女等共一千多人。会上，北京市人民政府代表接受了到会各界代表的一致要求，宣布接管仁慈堂，并由北京市公安局代表宣布逮捕虐杀中国儿童的仁慈堂前院长、帝国主义分子雷树芳（法籍修女）。会议开始后，仁慈堂儿童代表上台悲愤地控诉了帝国主义分子残害她们的罪恶。第一个上台控诉的儿童密敏华只讲了一句话，就泣不成声，她一字一泪地说：在日寇侵占北京期间，外国修女们强迫她替日寇打麻，那时正是冬天，而麻要用冷水泡，她的手都冻肿了。她十二岁的时候，修女们叫她在冬天跪着擦地板，腿冻得成了残疾。她又哭诉了她的母亲在堂内被雷树芳等虐待致死的经过。这时台下的几百个儿童也哭成了一片。第二个控诉的儿童是胡慕嘉，她立在扩音器前，看去只像是一个八、九岁的小女孩，但是实际上她已十五岁了。她在仁慈堂的八年中间，曾经被外国修女们打昏过几次，被送过残废院，受过各种威吓和奴役，以致她曾患过肺病和其他疾病。第三个上台控诉的女孩是蔺武才，她是抱病来参加大会的。她愤怒地控诉说：十九岁那年，北京解放了。“姑奶奶（即修女）”们骗她们说“共产党来了，大的姑娘都要拉出去分配。”这样，仁慈堂十五岁以上的女孩子，百分之三十被强迫嫁出，蔺武才也由院方作主给嫁了出去。结婚那天晚上，她才知道新郎是个傻子。她在这个傻子家里住了十一个月，因为忍不住痛苦才跑出来。蔺武才说：现在我已完全认识帝国主义分子丑恶面目了。今后我要坚决参加反对帝国主义的斗争。这时，台下的几百个儿童也都停止了哭泣，呼喊着“打倒帝国主义”等口号。
    在重重磨折中挣扎成人的仁慈堂女工崔大扬，拐着残废了的双腿走到台前，揭发该堂外国修女活埋儿童的万恶罪行。她曾经两次被外国修女强迫去活埋儿童。受难儿童的家属代表周海川也上台控诉了帝国主义分子的罪恶。这时，全场群众愤慨已极。孩子和到会各界代表一齐呼喊“要求人民政府惩办雷树芳”的口号，历久不息。北京市人民政府公安局代表当即上台宣布：人民政府坚决支持大家的要求，立即逮捕帝国主义分子雷树芳，并将迅速审讯，依法惩办。台下立刻爆发了暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声。
    接着发言的有：中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会秘书长康克清、北京市天主教革新运动促进委员会主席张英魁、北京市民主妇女联合会副主席刘清扬、民主党派代表陈铭德和中国人民救济总会副秘书长浦化人。他们都指出了帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的罪恶，并都表示坚决支持仁慈堂儿童、工人的要求。康克清和刘清扬的讲话中特别指出：中国的母亲们应该和全世界的母亲们团结起来，共同保卫自己孩子的和平幸福的生活，对万恶的帝国主义作坚决的斗争。
    在热烈的掌声中，曾在今年“七一”向毛主席献花的少年儿童队员程汝厂登台讲话。她热诚地对仁慈堂的儿童们说：“小朋友们，希望你们也很快地参加到我们这里来，让我们一同努力学习，共同过幸福的生活吧！”仁慈堂的儿童欢呼起来，高喊着：“我们要好好学习！”“我们要做新中国的好儿童！”
    最后，北京市人民政府民政局局长董汝勤代表北京市人民政府宣布正式接管仁慈堂。她勉励全堂儿童今后在人民政府的教养下努力学习，做新中国的好儿童。
