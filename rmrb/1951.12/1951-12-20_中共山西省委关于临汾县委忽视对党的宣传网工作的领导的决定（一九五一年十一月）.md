    Editor's Note: The decision of the Shanxi Provincial Committee regarding the Linfen County Committee's neglect of leadership over the Party's propaganda network work deserves the attention of all parts of the country. The Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau has circulated this decision to the provincial and municipal committees of North China, drawing their attention to this decision and conducting a focused inspection in the Party organizations under their jurisdiction, commending those who do well and helping those who do not do well to improve their work. Facts prove that the regular and earnest leadership of Party committees at all levels is the decisive factor in establishing and consolidating the Party's propaganda network among the people; and the neglect or relaxation of leadership by the Party committees is the fundamental reason why the Party's propaganda network among the people in some places has never been established or, although it has been established, does not work. Therefore, it is necessary for all localities to refer to the experience of the Shanxi Provincial Committee and, around the anniversary of the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Party Among the People," conduct an in-depth inspection of the leadership of the propaganda network work by the Party committees at all levels under their jurisdiction, and commend or criticize them according to their work, so as to further strengthen the Party's propaganda work among the people.
    In July and August, the Provincial Committee organized an inspection team to Linfen to inspect the work of the Party's propaganda network. According to the report of the inspection team, the Party's propaganda network in the county had greatly developed and played a significant role in the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries before May. However, the county committee did not pay enough attention to this work for a long time. The county committee never organized cadres to study the Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Party Among the People" and the Provincial Committee's Second Party Congress's "Decision and Plan on Universally Establishing the Party's Propaganda Network Throughout the Party This Year" properly, nor did it conduct good dissemination. At the county-wide expanded cadre meeting in March, only a cadre from the county committee's propaganda department made a speech on this work. What is particularly serious is that the county committee never seriously discussed the work of the Party's propaganda network once in the five months from March to August. As for the inspection and summary of this work, it is even more out of the question. Therefore, although the county's reporter system has been established in form, the reporters rarely go to the countryside to make political reports to the people due to lack of leadership. No propaganda instructor stations have been established to date. The county committee does not understand the situation of the propaganda network in the county, so that the work of the propaganda network is completely in a state of drift. The inspection team found that the Party branch of Jindian Village independently explored and carried out the work of the propaganda network and made many creations, but the county committee and the district committee of that district did not understand this situation, and of course, there was no question of leading the branch and promoting the experience they created.
    The Linfen County Committee's neglect of the leadership of the Party's propaganda network work should be pointed out as a serious error of principle. All the above facts prove that they have adopted an intolerable liberal attitude towards the decisions and instructions of the Central Committee, the North China Bureau, and the Provincial Committee regarding this work. The Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Party Among the People" clearly states: "The Party committees at all levels should regularly discuss the propaganda work for the people and regard the propagandists as an important bridge connecting the Party and the people, and provide regular leadership, assistance, and education." The North China Bureau also pointed out in its instructions for implementing this decision of the Central Committee: "The important key to whether propagandists can play a role lies in the help and guidance of the leading organs. The secretaries of Party committees at all levels must regard the work of leading propagandists as an important political task." The Provincial Committee's plan for establishing the Party's propaganda network clearly stipulates: "The standing committees of the Party at the district level and above must discuss the work of propagandists at least once a month, arrange propaganda tasks, and inspect the propaganda work of the previous month. At the same time, they must, in accordance with the provisions of the Central Committee, convene liaison meetings of branch secretaries and representative meetings of propagandists on time." "The rural district committee should organize Party member cadres of the same level in various systems to serve as propagandists, and assign responsibilities according to the distribution of branches in the entire district, and regularly inspect and help the branches carry out the work of propagandists." The Linfen County Committee has obviously treated these decisions, instructions, and regulations as mere wind in the ears for a long time in the past, and has ignored them, which is not allowed. Although they convened a county-wide representative meeting of propagandists in mid-August and began to realize their own mistakes, the current situation still proves that they are not determined to thoroughly correct this mistake. Therefore, the Provincial Committee has made the following decision:
    1. The Linfen County Committee must quickly convene a plenary committee to conduct a profound self-criticism of the above-mentioned errors. Before the meeting, each comrade must re-study the decisions and instructions of the Central Committee, the North China Bureau, and the Provincial Committee regarding this work, and, based on the spirit of these decisions and instructions, fully展开criticism and self-criticism in the meeting. It is necessary to clearly derive the root causes of the above-mentioned errors and the specific measures to correct the errors in the future through this self-criticism. The results of the self-criticism must be sent to the Provincial Committee in writing by the secretary of the county committee before the end of November.
    2. The Linfen County Committee must, in a planned and leadership-led manner, organize all Party members in the county to re-study the decisions, instructions, and plans of the Central Committee, the North China Bureau, and the Provincial Committee regarding the establishment of the Party's propaganda network among the people, so that every Party member can thoroughly understand that doing this work well is the most effective way to overcome the errors of bureaucracy and commandism in the work and to closely link the Party with the people. At the same time, make them thoroughly understand that "establishing the Party's propaganda network among the people is the basic way for the Party to carry out political work among the people" and "is a very urgent and important task in the current Party building."
    3. The Linfen County Committee must, in the near future, organize the necessary forces to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the actual situation of the propaganda network work in the county, so as to discover and quickly correct the shortcomings and errors existing in this work; discover model propagandists and Party branches, and commend and promote their experience throughout the county. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the regular inspection system in the future, and organize mutual inspection and exchange of experience between villages and villages, districts and districts in a planned manner.
    4. The secretary of the county committee must take the lead, serve as a reporter, and personally lead all the reporters in the county to make political reports to the people on time in accordance with the system stipulated by the Provincial Committee (the content of the reports should be closely integrated with the central work of the county in each period), and go to the dissemination stations in various districts on time to disseminate to the propagandists. Each district must quickly establish dissemination stations according to the needs of the actual situation, and the members of the district committee must divide their responsibilities to lead the work of the dissemination stations.
    5. The Party committees at the county and district levels must, in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Committee, discuss and study the work of the Party's propaganda network on time, and at the same time, must discuss the ideological situation inside and outside the Party once every two months, so as to strengthen the ideological guidance of reporters and propagandists. Before each discussion, the propaganda departments of the Party at all levels must prepare discussion outlines and plans for improving this work in the future.
    6. It is necessary to strengthen the training of propagandists. First of all, the secretaries and propaganda committee members of all Party branches should receive basic education in this work, so as to improve the political and ideological level and working ability of propagandists.
    The above decision is entrusted to the Linfen Prefectural Committee to supervise and inspect the implementation of the Linfen County Committee, and must submit a report on the implementation of this decision to the Provincial Committee before the end of December. At the same time, in view of the fact that other Party committees at all levels in other places may also have errors similar to those of the Linfen County Committee, this decision is hereby announced to the entire Party. It is hoped that the Party committees at all levels in the province will generally conduct a self-inspection in accordance with this decision and summarize the work of the propaganda network in the past year. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee and the local committees should send this summary to the Provincial Committee before December 5, in order to prepare for the Provincial Representative Meeting of Propagandists to be held in late December.

    中共山西省委关于临汾县委忽视对党的宣传网工作的领导的决定
    （一九五一年十一月）
    编者按：山西省委关于临汾县委忽视对党的宣传网的领导的决定，值得引起全国各地注意。华北局宣传部已将这个决定通报华北各省、市委，引起他们注意这个决定，并在所属党的组织中同样进行一次有重点的检查，表扬工作好的，帮助工作不好的改进工作。事实证明：各级党委的经常的认真的领导，是建立和巩固党对人民群众的宣传网的决定因素；而党委的忽视或放松领导，就是某些地方的党对人民群众的宣传网始终没有建立起来或虽已建立起来但是却不起作用的根本原因。因此，各地都有必要参照山西省委的经验，在中央发布“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”一周年的前后，深入检查所属各级党委对宣传网工作的领导，并按其工作好坏，分别加以表扬或批评，以便进一步加强党对人民群众的宣传工作。
    七、八两月份省委曾组织一个检查组，到临汾检查党的宣传网工作。根据检查组的报告：该县党的宣传网，在五月以前抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动中，曾有很大发展，并起过不小的作用。但该县县委对这一工作长时期内没有予以足够的重视。中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”和省委第二次党代表会议“关于在今年内全党普遍建立党的宣传网的决定及计划”，县委从未组织干部好好学习，也不曾进行过很好的传达。三月在全县党的扩大干部会议上，只是由县委宣传部一个干事在会议上作了一个有关此项工作的发言。尤其严重的，该县县委从三月至八月五个月长的时间内，从未认真讨论过一次党的宣传网工作。至于对此项工作的检查与总结，更谈不到了。因此，该县报告员制度虽然形式上建立起来了，但报告员由于缺乏领导，很少下乡去向人民群众作政治报告。宣传员传授站至今一个也没有建立起来。县委对全县宣传网的情况很不了解，致使宣传网的工作完全陷于自流状态。这次检查组发现金殿村党的支部在宣传网工作上独自摸索进行，并有许多创造，但该县县委和那个区的区委都不了解这种情况，当然也就谈不到对该支部的领导和推广他们所创造的经验了。
    临汾县委如此忽视对党的宣传网工作的领导，应当指出这是一种严重的原则性的错误。所有以上的事实，证明他们对于中央、华北局以及省委有关此项工作的决定和指示，采取了不可容忍的自由主义的态度。中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”中说得很明白：“党的各级委员会应当经常讨论对于人民群众的宣传工作，并且把宣传员看作是联系党和人民群众的重要桥梁而加以经常的领导、帮助和教育。”华北局在执行中央这一决定的指示中也指出：“宣传员能否发挥作用的重要关键，在于领导机关的帮助与指导。各级党委书记必须把领导宣传员的工作当作重要的政治任务。”省委在建立党的宣传网的计划中更明白规定：“区以上各级党的常委会，每月至少须讨论一次宣传员工作，布置宣传任务，检查上月宣传工作。同时，必须按照中央规定，按时召开支书联席会议及宣传员代表会议。”“农村区委应组织同级各系统党员干部担任宣传员工作，并按全区支部分布状况，分工负责，经常检查与帮助支部进行宣传员工作。”临汾县委对于上述这些决定、指示和规定，在过去长时期内显然地当作耳边风而置诸脑后了，这是不能容许的。虽然他们在八月中旬之后，召开了全县宣传员代表会议，开始发觉了他们自己这种错误，但就目前的情况看来，依然证明他们没有决心彻底纠正这种错误。为此省委特作如下决定：
    一、临汾县委必须迅速召开一次全体委员会，对上述错误进行一次深刻的检讨。会前每个同志必须重新温习中央、华北局以及省委有关此项工作的决定和指示，并根据这些决定和指示的精神，在会议中充分展开批评和自我批评。必须经过这次检讨明确得出产生上述错误的根源及今后纠正错误的具体办法。检讨结果，务必于十一月底前由县委书记负责向省委送来书面报告。
    二、临汾县委必须有领导、有计划地组织全县所有党员重新学习中央、华北局以及省委有关建立党对人民群众的宣传网的决定、指示和计划，以便使每个党员透彻地了解：做好此项工作是克服工作中存在着的官僚主义、命令主义的错误并密切党与人民群众联系的最有效的办法。同时使他们透彻地了解：“建立党对人民群众的宣传网是党在人民群众中进行政治工作的基本方式”，“是目前党的建设中，非常迫切的重要的工作任务。”
    三、临汾县委必须于最近期间，对全县宣传网工作的实际状况，组织必要的力量进行一次全面的检查，以便发现并迅速纠正这一工作中存在着的缺点和错误；发现模范的宣传员和党的支部，并在全县范围内表扬与推广他们的经验。同时今后必须加强经常的检查制度，有计划地组织村与村，区与区互相检查与交流经验。
    四、县委书记必须以身作则，担任报告员工作，并亲自领导全县所有报告员，按照省委规定的制度，按时向人民群众作政治报告（报告内容，应与全县每一时期的中心工作密切结合），并按时到各区传授站给宣传员进行传授。每个区必须根据实际情况的需要，迅速地建立传授站，区委委员必须分工负责领导传授站的工作。
    五、县、区两级党的委员会，都必须按照省委规定，按时讨论与研究党的宣传网的工作，同时每两个月必须讨论一次党内外的思想状况，以便加强对报告员、宣传员的思想指导。在每次讨论之前，各级党的宣传部必须拟出讨论提纲以及关于今后改进此项工作的方案。
    六、必须加强对宣传员的训练工作。首先应使所有党支部的书记和宣传委员，普遍受到此项工作的基本教育，以便提高宣传员的政治思想水平与工作能力。
    以上决定，责成临汾地委督促与检查临汾县委贯彻执行，并须于十二月底前向省委作一次关于执行这一决定的情况的报告。同时鉴于其他各地各级党委可能也存在有类似临汾县委的错误，故将此决定公布全党。希全省各级党委普遍根据这一决定进行一次自我检查，并总结一年来的宣传网的工作。此项总结太原市委及各地委应于十二月五日前送到省委，以便迎接十二月下旬即将召开的全省宣传员代表会议。
