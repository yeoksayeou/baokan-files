To Chairman Mao:

The National Textile Industry Conference, attended by administrative representatives, entrepreneurs, and trade union representatives from state-owned and private factories in the national cotton, wool, hemp, silk, printing and dyeing, replication, and textile machinery manufacturing industries, has now concluded victoriously.

The conference summarized the achievements and experiences of the textile industry in transforming from old enterprises to new enterprises over the past two years and discussed the production plans for various industries in 1952. According to this plan, the output of various textile industrial products will greatly exceed that of this year. The production volume of cotton, hemp, printing and dyeing, and textile machinery manufacturing will all break the highest records in Chinese history. Over the past two years, thanks to your wise leadership and that of the Communist Party, the high level of enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, and the efforts of our peasant brothers in raw material production, the old semi-colonial textile industry has been transformed into a new democratic enterprise, achieving rapid recovery and development. We sincerely express our heartfelt gratitude to you!

We, all the delegates, enthusiastically responded to your great call to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" and conducted serious and specific research and discussions. We recognized that increasing production and practicing economy is not only of great significance for strengthening national defense, supporting the People's Volunteers, and accelerating national economic construction, but also a fundamental policy for improving business management. Due to the limited supply of raw materials in the textile industry and the inability to fully utilize equipment, we have decided to increase the production of cotton yarn by 100,000 bales (which can weave 3.6 million bolts of cloth), 1.95 million麻袋 (ma dai - sacks), and 50,000 spindles of textile machinery on the basis of saving raw materials. We will also reduce costs in all aspects, accelerate the turnover of working capital, improve technology, and promote advanced working methods, to increase production and save a total of 3,784.44 billion yuan worth of wealth for the country (of which state-owned factories account for 50%) and strive to reach 4 trillion yuan.

We firmly guarantee to you that we will deepen the movement of increasing production and practicing economy into every corner of the textile industry; mobilize all workers, administrative staff, technicians, and entrepreneurs in the textile industry to work hard to complete and strive to over fulfill this glorious task, in order to strengthen the national defense and economic construction of our great motherland!

With highest respect!

The entire delegation of the National Textile Industry Conference

    全国纺织工业会议全体代表
    写信向毛主席保证实现明年生产计划毛主席：全国棉、毛、麻、丝、印染、复制、纺织机械制造等公私营工厂的行政、企业家和工会代表参加的全国纺织工业会议，现在胜利闭幕了。
    会议总结了两年来纺织工业由旧企业改造为新企业的成就和经验，讨论了一九五二年各业的生产计划。按照这个计划，各种纺织工业产品的产量都将大大超过今年。棉、麻、印染、纺织机械制造的生产量都将打破我国历史上的最高纪录。两年来，由于您及共产党的英明领导，工人阶级高度的积极性与创造性和农民兄弟在原料生产上的努力，使旧的半殖民地性的纺织工业改变为新民主主义的企业，达到迅速地恢复和发展，我们衷心向您致诚挚的感谢！
    我们全体代表热烈响应您“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，进行了认真而具体的研究和讨论，认识了增产节约不仅对于加强国防、支援人民志愿军、加速国家经济建设具有伟大意义，而且也是改进企业经营管理的根本方针。由于纺织工业原料还不充裕，设备利用率还不能充分发挥，但我们决定在节约原料的基础上，增产棉纱十万件（可织三百六十万匹布），麻袋一百九十五万条，纺机五万锭，并将从各方面降低成本，加速流动资金的周转，改进技术，推广先进工作法，为国家增产节约三万七千八百四十四亿元总值的财富（其中国营厂占百分之五十）并争取达到四万亿元。
    我们坚决向您保证：一定要将增产节约运动深入到纺织工业的每一个角落去；动员纺织工业的全体工人们、行政管理人员们、技术人员们以及企业家们，努力完成并争取超额完成这个光荣任务，以加强我们伟大祖国的国防建设和经济建设力量！此致崇高的敬礼！
                            全国纺织工业会议全体代表同上    一九五一年十二月十一日
