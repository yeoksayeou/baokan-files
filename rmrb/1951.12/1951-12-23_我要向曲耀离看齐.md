    I Want to Emulate Qu Yaoli
    Editor: Last year, I went from Lixian County, Hunan to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. This year, I came to Beijing again to participate in the Second National Day celebration. During my two trips to Beijing, I personally witnessed the progress of our motherland in various aspects of construction in the past year, which is truly like flying. New production records in our country are constantly emerging, and Qu Yaoli's high-yield achievements have further encouraged me. This year, the cotton we planted has three main shortcomings: First, the planting was late; second, the seeds were not of good quality; and third, no pruning or topping was done, so the yield was not high. I must learn from Qu Yaoli and emulate him, and I hope that cotton farmers across the country will learn from him and emulate him together.
    After hearing Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," I immediately went home and held a family meeting, and we formulated a plan to increase production and practice thrift. I plan to open up a piece of land next year as a high-yield experimental field with a target of producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. For ordinary cotton fields, we strive to produce 400 jin per mu. Now, I am using the winter slack season to plant 0.6 mu of vegetables. Because the days are short in winter, eating two meals a day is enough, and each meal is mixed with vegetables, which saves some grain and fuel, and we prepare to invest this in reproduction. I think that the winter slack season is a good time. Men can engage in more various side occupations; collect more weeds and leaves from the edges of the fields as fuel; and accumulate more manure fertilizer. In winter, there is little rain and the ponds are shallow. Everyone can help each other to bail out the water and dig up the pond mud, which is also a very good fertilizer. Women can raise more chickens and pigs at home, and spin and weave more cloth at night. In short, we must be diligent and thrifty, so that we can "make it last," and lay the foundation for next year's production increase campaign. This is what my family has done.

    我要向曲耀离看齐
    编辑同志：去年，我从湖南澧县到北京出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。今年，我又到北京参加第二届国庆典礼。两次到北京，我亲眼看到我们祖国在这一年中在各方面的建设，真像飞一般地前进着。我国生产上的新纪录不断出现，曲耀离的丰产成绩，更鼓舞了我。今年我们种的棉花，大都有三个缺点：一、播种晚了，二、种子不优良，三、没有整枝去顶，因此产量不高。我一定要向曲耀离学习，向他看齐，希望全国棉农兄弟，一起向他学习看齐。
    我听到毛主席提出“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召后，马上回家开了一个家庭会议，订出了增产节约的计划。我打算明年辟一块地，作为每亩产籽棉一千斤的丰产试验地。普通的棉田，每亩争取要产到四百斤。现在我利用冬闲，已种了六分地的蔬菜。因为冬天日短，每天吃两顿也够了，每顿饭里都拌上蔬菜，这样就节省了一部分粮食和燃料，准备投入再生产。我觉得，现在冬闲是好时光，男人可以多搞各种副业；多搜集地边杂草、树叶作燃料；多积些粪肥。冬季雨少，池塘水浅，大家互助把水戽干，把塘泥挖起来，这也是很好的肥料。女人可以在家多养鸡喂猪，夜晚多纺纱织布。总之，要勤俭节约，才能“细水长流”，为明年增产运动打下基础。我家就是这样做了的。杨天才
