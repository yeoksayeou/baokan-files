    Newspaper Maps Must Be Complete and Accurate
    To the Editors: Maps are an important way to enhance the propaganda effect of newspapers. In late August, when newspapers in various places published information introducing "Nansha Island and the Xisha Islands," they also published maps of the South China Sea islands, clearly showing that Nansha Island and the Xisha Islands are Chinese territory, and exposing the complete acts of aggression of American and French imperialism towards these islands. This was very necessary. However, the maps published by five newspapers were very sloppy and incomplete. Some of these maps omitted important islands, and some did not show the actual location of China's South China Sea islands. Therefore, although these newspapers published maps, they did not play their due propaganda role. For example, the maps published in the Shanghai Labor Daily and Xinwen Daily on August 24 only marked the Xisha Islands, Nansha Islands, Nansha Island, and other islands, omitting the Dongsha Islands and Zhongsha Islands. On the same day, the map published in the Yunnan Daily also omitted the Dongsha Islands. The map published in the Tianjin Daily on August 23 not only did not draw the Philippines, Vietnam and other places close to China's South China Sea border, but also did not draw the Zhongsha Islands and Dongsha Islands. The map published in the Sunan Daily on August 24 was also incomplete. At that time, the newspapers published this map to illustrate the fact that Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out in the "Statement on the Draft of the US-British Peace Treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference" that "the Xisha Islands and Nansha Island, like the entire Nansha Islands and the Zhongsha Islands and Dongsha Islands, have always been Chinese territory." If the Dongsha Islands and Zhongsha Islands are not marked on the map, this goal cannot be achieved. Such an incomplete map provides readers with an introduction that is not entirely consistent with the actual situation, and therefore cannot be regarded as a technical problem. In the future, we hope that newspapers in various places will draw and publish maps with an extremely serious and responsible attitude, ensuring that no important locations are omitted and no errors occur.

    报纸刊登形势图必须完整无误
    编辑同志：形势图是加强报纸宣传效果的重要方式之一。八月下旬，各地有些报纸在刊登“南威岛和西沙群岛介绍”的资料时，同时刊登了南海诸岛屿的形势图，清晰地表明了南威岛、西沙群岛是我国的领土，并揭露了美、法帝国主义对这些岛屿的觊觎完全是侵略行为。这是非常必要的。但有五家报纸刊出的形势图，却是十分草率和不完整的。这些形势图有的把重要岛屿漏掉，有的没有表示出我国南海诸岛屿所处的实际位置。因此，这些报纸虽然刊出了形势图，但并没有发挥了它应有的宣传作用。例如八月二十四日的上海劳动报、新闻日报所刊登的形势图，就是只标明了西沙群岛、南沙群岛、南威岛等岛屿，而把东沙群岛、中沙群岛漏掉。同日，云南日报刊登的形势图中，也把东沙群岛漏掉。八月二十三日天津日报所刊登的形势图，不只没有把接近我国南海边境的菲律宾、越南等地绘出来，而且也没有把中沙群岛、东沙群岛绘出来。八月二十四日苏南日报所刊登的形势图，也是不完整的。各报当时刊载这幅形势图，是为了说明周外长在“关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明”中所指出的“西沙群岛和南威岛正如整个南沙群岛及中沙群岛、东沙群岛一样，向为中国领土”这一事实，如果不把东沙群岛、中沙群岛在形势图上标明出来，就达不到这个目的。这样不完整的形势图，是向读者作了不完全符合实际情况的介绍，因此绝不能看做是一个技术问题。今后希望各地报纸在绘制和刊登形势图时，以极其认真负责的态度，作到既不遗漏重要地点又不发生错误。
