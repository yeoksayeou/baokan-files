Since the Korean armistice negotiations entered the discussion of the third agenda item on November 27, the 30-day deadline proposed by the US side itself for reaching a complete armistice agreement has passed for 29 days. In the course of this negotiation, although our side has put forward fair and reasonable solutions several times in order to break the deadlock caused by the US side's various unreasonable demands, the US side has shamelessly insisted on interfering in North Korea's internal affairs, so that the 30-day deadline is about to expire, and the solution of the third agenda item is still nowhere in sight, let alone reaching a complete armistice agreement.

As everyone knows, our side, based on its consistent proposition of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, put forward five fair and reasonable principles at the beginning of the third agenda item. On December 3, it put forward two supplementary suggestions. Subsequently, on December 14, our side re-proposed six principles based on the above seven suggestions. These several principle suggestions all proceed from the basic consideration of quickly reaching an armistice agreement to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and also pay attention to guaranteeing the stability of the armistice agreement and making certain provisions for the needs of the soldiers at the front. These suggestions are completely fair and reasonable, and completely conform to the requirements of a genuine armistice agreement. However, the US side is unwilling to accept any of these suggestions. On the one hand, they brazenly attempt to restrict the sacred rights of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to build and defend their motherland; on the other hand, they attempt to use the armistice to strengthen the strength of their aggressive troops without any restrictions in the name of rotation and replenishment. On the one hand, they unscrupulously demand to move freely in the ground and sky of the entire North Korea in the name of supervision and inspection, and carry out unlimited aerial and ground reconnaissance, including photographic reconnaissance; on the other hand, when our side proposed that neutral countries be responsible for certain inspection tasks, they delayed answering for several days. It was only due to our side's firm questioning and merciless exposure that the US side agreed to allow representatives of neutral countries to be responsible for the task of rear inspection.

Now the focus of the dispute between the two sides is: (1) Our side believes that in order to ensure the stability of the armistice agreement, neither side should introduce any military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside North Korea. The US side, however, believes that for this purpose, neither side should increase military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition in North Korea, and that the restoration of a limited number of civilian airports in specific locations should be stipulated, excluding the extension of runways. Any other airports may not be restored or built. (2) Our side believes that rear inspections for certain tasks should be carried out at rear ports agreed upon by both sides and at locations where violations of the armistice agreement are reported. The US side, however, wants to conduct such inspections without restrictions and to include unrestricted aerial reconnaissance and aerial photographic reconnaissance within the scope of such inspections.

From this, we can see very clearly who is sincerely seeking a genuine armistice in Korea, and who is trying to use the armistice to interfere in North Korea's internal affairs in order to achieve their delusional goal of aggression and control over Korea. At the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations, our side advocated discussing the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, which is of course the most reliable condition for guaranteeing the Korean armistice. However, because the US side insisted on stationing troops in Korea, the issue of foreign troop withdrawal was moved to the fifth agenda item as a suggestion to the relevant governments of both sides. However, even if foreign troops cannot be withdrawn from Korea temporarily, neither side should have any right to continue importing military forces, including manpower and materials, from foreign countries during the armistice period; to ensure the stability of the armistice agreement, this is natural and necessary. This is completely opposite in principle to the US side's proposition of not increasing military forces, including manpower and materials, in North Korea, and the restrictions on airports. The US side's proposition is an attempt to use the armistice to prevent the Korean people from relying on their own efforts to exercise their inherent right to self-defense and carry out their national defense construction, so that after suffering the inhumane destruction of the American aggressors, and while the US's powerful and barbaric aggressor army is still entrenched on their territory, they are in a state of lack of defense, so that the American imperialists can continue their vicious conspiracy to invade and occupy Korea. The same diametrically opposed position is also reflected in the issue of inspection. Our side proposes to carry out inspections for certain tasks in certain locations, which is a necessary move to ensure that the armistice agreement is not violated. However, the US side attempts to carry out comprehensive intelligence reconnaissance activities throughout North Korea from the sky and the ground under the guise of armistice supervision. Even the American imperialist newspaper, the Washington Post, couldn't stand this unfounded and unreasonable demand for free inspection, and asked in its December 6th editorial: "How strict does the inspection system need to be to give the Allied forces security? The Allied forces, which have not occupied the entire Korea, do not seem likely to expect all its conditions to be fully accepted." The American aggressors have precisely gone mad to the point of not knowing the facts. When it had only occupied southern Korea, it wanted to treat the entire Korea as its occupied territory, and brazenly and shamelessly demanded to restrict North Korea's facilities, conduct free inspection in North Korea, and interfere in North Korea's internal affairs. Can any fair-minded person with political common sense tolerate such a mad demand?

To answer this question that everyone is demanding an answer to, the US side put forward three reasons: First, they believe that complete national sovereignty "no longer exists" in today's world, so they have the right to interfere in North Korea's internal affairs. Second, they said that they were able to interfere in North Korea's internal affairs and restrict facilities during the war, so they should be able to continue this interference during the armistice period. They also said that this interference was to ensure the stability of the armistice agreement. Strictly speaking, these ignorant, unreasonable, arrogant, and arbitrary statements should all be the language of half-civilized people in zoos or barbaric societies, and are not worth paying attention to. However, the American aggressors are not only saying this kind of language, but are also openly acting in human society according to the meaning of these languages, which cannot but require us to pay serious attention. The US's so-called reason for guaranteeing the stability of the armistice agreement is completely unreasonable. Due to the fact that the United States launched an aggression against North Korea, restricting North Korea's facilities is enough to encourage aggression and make the armistice agreement unstable. What can truly guarantee the stability of the armistice agreement is not to introduce any military forces, including manpower and materials, from outside North Korea. The US side, because it is at a loss for words on this point, then drags in what they can interfere in North Korea's internal affairs. It is true that the American imperialists have long placed the sovereignty of their servant countries under their feet and freely interfered in their internal affairs. It also attempts to trample on the sovereignty of other countries in the world in order to dominate the world. However, what it faces today is a completely independent sovereign country. This country, in order to protect the integrity of its sovereignty and the safety of its people, is exercising its sacred right to strengthen itself and resist American aggression. Although the American imperialists can use barbaric artillery fire to cause material losses to North Korea, US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg had to admit that despite their round-the-clock and continuous bombing of North Korea, North Korea still had "three airports that were found to be under expansion." It can be seen that the US side was unable to restrict North Korea's facilities during the war. Precisely because it could not achieve its goal of undermining North Korea's sovereignty even with a barbaric war of aggression, it is now trying to obtain from the negotiating table what it could not obtain in the war. Since the issue of sovereignty and internal affairs cannot be resolved by the American barbarian generals on the battlefield, and must be brought to the negotiating table, the American imperialists should first stop increasing their military equipment in the United States, stop building airports and docks, and welcome our representatives to the United States to conduct free inspections from the sky and the ground. The American aggressors should first hand over their complete national sovereignty to our side for control and control. This is in line with their claim that complete national sovereignty does not exist today. The United States, while advocating this, is unwilling to act in this way itself, and uses various deceptive methods, contradictory reasons, and threats to seize the sovereignty of other countries from the negotiating table, hoping to use the armistice negotiations to obtain the fruits of the war of aggression. This is by no means a manifestation of its strength, but on the contrary, a manifestation of its weakness.

The Korean War over the past year and a half has taught the arrogant American imperialists a heavy lesson. It proves that the US Army is certainly unable to undertake the task of invading and occupying North Korea, and even its Air Force, which it regards as its trump card, is becoming increasingly weak and unable to cope with everything under the strong blows of our People's Air Force. The deep fear of the increasingly strong People's Armed Forces of China and North Korea is the real reason why the US side insists on the right to interfere in North Korea's internal affairs, hoping to use this to maintain its aggressive position and strength, and would rather delay the Korean negotiations if it cannot achieve this goal.

We know that the American imperialists, who believe in force and vainly attempt to conquer the world through war, place all their hopes in Korea on military strength. Before the negotiations, it naturally poured the strength of its national army and air force into bombing North Korea wildly, just like the Japanese imperialists in our War of Resistance, hoping to destroy the people's will to resist with wild bombing. Even during the negotiations, it had a summer offensive on the left and an autumn offensive on the right. The US Chief Representative Joye bragged about their so-called "military pressure" every day in the negotiations, hoping to use this so-called "pressure" to help them get a bargain in the negotiations. But despite their boasting about pressure, they already know that this pressure is unreliable. In just the eleven and a half months from October 25, 1950, to October 10 of this year, our side killed, wounded, and captured a total of more than 387,000 enemy troops, of which the US military alone accounted for more than 176,000. The Air Force relied on by the United States had 2,300 aircraft shot down, damaged, and captured in eleven and a half months. Especially since the US's so-called autumn offensive, the US side's losses in aircraft have greatly increased, and the entire US ruling class has been shocked by the power of our Air Force and the losses of their own aircraft. US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, after specially coming to Korea to study the situation, had to publicly admit at a press conference on November 21 that "the situation in the air may become serious, even critical"; "If we did not have our dominant position in the air, we would almost certainly have been driven out of Korea long ago." From this, we can see that the US's heart disease in Korea is that its armed forces are seriously incompatible with its aggressive intentions. On the one hand, it feels fear at the growing current threat of our People's Air Force; on the other hand, it is unwilling to stop its attempt to invade North Korea because it admits that the difficulties have increased. Therefore, it has no choice but to hope to fish in troubled waters, sometimes saying that it wants to restrict all of our military equipment, sometimes saying that it wants to restrict airports and related equipment; sometimes it does not allow the increase of military equipment, and sometimes it emphasizes that it does not allow the increase of aircraft; sometimes it wants to inspect everywhere, and sometimes it specifically designates to inspect air transport ports. It is well known that these are illegal demands that interfere in North Korea's internal affairs and damage North Korea's sovereignty, and no legitimate reason can be given. Therefore, it speaks nonsense, saying that it is to ensure the stability of the armistice agreement, and then drags in the nonsense that complete sovereignty does not exist today, and brags about the lie that it has restricted our equipment in the war. All this is completely contradictory and chaotic, deceiving oneself and others. And in order to achieve its goal of delaying negotiations if it cannot interfere in North Korea's internal affairs, it has adopted a completely irresponsible approach to the people and prisoners of war, and is eager to discuss the issue of prisoners of war in order to use the captured soldiers as bargaining chips for the third agenda item. Therefore, the US side shouts loudly about how concerned they are about the prisoners of war, but in the discussion of the fourth agenda item, they refuse to discuss the issue of the rapid release of prisoners, and first demand the list of prisoners and the inspection rights of the International Committee of the Red Cross. And in the daily group meetings, it creates something out of nothing, adds branches, and delays as much as possible. Its purpose is precisely to hope to find an excuse and create some kind of pressure in order to help its unreasonable demands and delaying methods in the third agenda item. Under the delay of this irresponsible and reckless tactic, the 30-day negotiation period is about to be exhausted. And the US's insistence on the unreasonable demand to interfere in North Korea's internal affairs has caused a major blow to the peace wishes of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world and the reunion of thousands of prisoners of war and their families. The American imperialists should bear full responsibility for the consequences of this delay in negotiations.

As for our side, we have always been based on the proposition of quickly reaching an armistice agreement in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and believe that foreign troops and foreign military forces should only withdraw from Korea during the armistice period and not enter Korea. Our side has no intention of importing military forces from outside North Korea, and we absolutely cannot tolerate any interference in North Korea's internal affairs. This is because what our side requires is not to continue the war in Korea, but to achieve an armistice in Korea; it is not to maintain a state of war in Korea, but to achieve peace in Korea. We Chinese people will continue to work with the Korean people based on our consistent proposition to strive for a fair and reasonable Korean armistice agreement. If the American imperialists, out of excessive fear, dare to go from delaying negotiations to sabotaging negotiations like a crazy person running wild from a stroke, their attempt will inevitably suffer our firm blows and finally have to accept a just peace.

### 美国坚持干涉朝鲜内政的真正原因

    美国坚持干涉朝鲜内政的真正原因
    朝鲜停战谈判自十一月二十七日进入第三项议程的讨论以来，美方自己所提的达成全部停战协议的三十天限期已经过去了二十九天了。在这次谈判过程中，虽然我方为了打开由于美方种种蛮横无理的要求所造成的僵局，曾经几次提出了公平合理的解决方案，但美方始终恬不知耻地坚持干涉朝鲜内政，以致三十天的期限即将届满，而第三项议程的解决还是毫无眉目，更不用说达成全部停战协议了。
    大家知道，我方本着和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张，在第三项议程一开始，就提出了五项公平合理的原则。十二月三日又提出了两项补充建议。其后，在十二月十四日，我方又根据上述七项建议而重新提出了六项原则。这几次的原则建议都是从迅速达成停战协议，以利于朝鲜问题的和平解决的基本考虑出发，并且也注意到了保证停战协定的稳定以及前线士兵的需要而为之作了某些规定。这些建议完全是公平合理，完全符合于一个真正停战协定的要求的。但是美方对于这些建议却一个也不愿意接受。他们一方面蛮横地企图限制朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建设和保卫他们的祖国的神圣权利；另一方面却又企图在轮换和补充的名义之下，利用停战来不受任何限制地增强他们的侵略军队的实力。他们一方面肆无忌惮地要求假借监督和视察的名义，在朝鲜全境的地面和天空自由活动，进行无限制的空中和地上侦察，包括摄影侦察；另一方面，当我方提出由中立国来担负一定的视察任务时，他们竟拖延好几天不肯答复。仅仅由于我方坚决的追问和无情的揭发，美方才同意了由中立国家的代表来担负后方视察的任务。
    现在双方争执的焦点是：（一）我方认为为了保证停战协定的稳定，双方应不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事人员，作战飞机，装甲车辆，武器和弹药。而美方则认为为了这个目的，双方应不增加在朝鲜的军事人员，作战飞机，装甲车辆，武器和弹药，并且要规定特定地点的有限数目的民用航空机场的修复，不得包括跑道的延长。任何其他机场不得修复和兴建。（二）我方认为为了一定的任务而进行的后方视察时，其地点应该是双方同意的后方口岸及报告违反停战协议事件的地点。而美方则要无限制地进行这种视察并要在这种视察的范围之内，把无限制的空中侦察和空中摄影侦察都包括进去。
    从这里，我们可以看得很清楚谁是诚心诚意谋求在朝鲜的真正停战，谁是企图利用停战来干涉朝鲜内政以达到其妄想中的侵略和控制朝鲜的目的。我方在朝鲜停战谈判之始，就主张讨论一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，这当然是保证朝鲜停战的最可靠的条件。但由于美方坚持要在朝鲜驻军，外国撤军的问题就被移到第五项议程中，作为向双方有关政府的建议事项。不过外国军队即令可以暂时不从朝鲜撤退，双方都不应有任何权利在停战期间继续从外国输入军事力量，包括人力和物力；为了保证停战协定的稳定，这是很自然的而且是必要的，这和美方所主张的不得增加在朝鲜的军事力量，包括人力和物力，以及对于机场的限制完全是原则上截然相反的两件事情。美方的主张是企图利用停战，不许朝鲜人民依靠自己的努力去行使他们天赋的自卫权力，进行他们的国防建设，使他们在遭受了美国侵略者灭绝人性的破坏之后，在美方强大的野蛮的侵略军还盘据在他们的领土上的时候，处于缺少防御的状态，以便美帝国主义者继续其侵占朝鲜的恶毒阴谋。同样的截然不同的立场也表现在视察问题方面。我方提出为了一定的任务而在一定的地点进行视察，这是为了保证停战协定不受破坏而应有的举动。可是美方却企图假停战监督之名，在朝鲜全境从天空和地面进行全面全体的情报侦查活动。这种毫无根据，毫无道理的自由视察的要求，甚至连美帝国主义的报纸华盛顿邮报都听不惯，而在其十二月六日的社论中发问道：“视察制度需要严密到什么程度才能给联军以保障呢？并未占领整个朝鲜的联军，好像不大可能期望它的一切条件能够获得全部接受。”美国侵略者恰恰就是已经疯狂到事理不知了。在它还只是占领了南部朝鲜的时候，它就想把整个朝鲜当做它的占领地区来看待，公然无耻地要求限制朝鲜的设备，在朝鲜进行自由视察，干涉朝鲜的内政。任何一个有政治常识的公正人士能够容忍这样的疯狂要求吗？
    美方为回答这一个人人都在要求答案的问题，提出了三个理由：第一、他们认为完整的国家主权在今天的世界上“已经不存在”了，因此他们就可以有权来干涉朝鲜的内政。第二、他们说他们在战时是能够对朝鲜干涉内政，限制设备的，因此停战时期也应该能够继续这种干涉。他们又说他们的这种干涉行动是为了保证停战协定的稳定。严格地说，这种无知，无理，狂妄，武断的说法都应该是动物园里面或者野蛮社会中半开化人的语言，不值得去加以理会。但是美国侵略者却不但在说着这种语言，并且正按照这些语言的意义在人类社会里面公然行动，这不能不要求我们加以严重注意。美国所谓的保证停战协定的稳定的理由是完全没有道理的。由于美国发动对朝鲜的侵略这一事实，朝鲜的限制设备正足以鼓励侵略而使停战协定不能稳定。真正能保证停战协定的稳定的是不从朝鲜境外进入任何军事力量，包括人力和物力。美方因为在这一点上理屈词穷，于是就扯到什么他们能够干涉朝鲜内政。不错，美帝国主义者对待它的仆从国家，是早已就在把它们的主权放在自己脚下，而放手地去干涉他们的内政的。它并且企图蹂躏全世界其他国家的主权以便独霸全世界。但是，今天它所面对的却是一个完全独立的主权国家。这个国家为了保护其主权的完整和人民的安全，正在执行它的神圣权利来加强自己，抵抗美国的侵略。美帝国主义者虽然能够用野蛮的炮火在物资方面给朝鲜造成损失，但是美国空军参谋长范顿伯却不得不承认，尽管他们日夜不断地在朝鲜疯狂轰炸，朝鲜还是有“三个飞机场被发现正在扩充之中”，可见美方在战时是没有能够限制朝鲜的设备的。正因为它即使用了野蛮的侵略战争也不能达到其破坏朝鲜的主权的目的，因此，它才又企图从谈判桌上取得它在战争中所得不到的东西。既然主权和内政的问题不能够由美国的野蛮将军们在战场上解决，而要提到谈判桌上来，那么美帝国主义者首先就应该停止在美国增加军备，停止建筑机场船坞，欢迎我方代表到美国去从天空和地上进行自由视察。美国侵略者应该首先把它的完整的国家主权交出来由我方支配和控制，这才符合于他们的完整的国家主权在今天不存在的主张。美国一面这样主张，一面却又自己不肯这样行动而以种种欺骗的办法、矛盾的理由和威胁希图从谈判桌上夺取其他国家的主权，希望利用停战谈判来得到侵略战争的果实。这决不是表现它的强大，相反，而是表现它的软弱。
    一年半以来的朝鲜战争给骄狂的美帝国主义者上了沉重的一课。它证明了美国的陆军固然是担负不了侵占朝鲜的任务，就是它所视为王牌的空军也在我方人民空军的坚强打击之下越来越中气不足，顾此失彼。对中朝日益壮大的人民武装的深刻的恐惧就是美方坚持干涉朝鲜内政的权利，希图借此保持他的侵略地位和力量，不能达到这个目的就宁愿使朝鲜谈判拖延下去的真正原因。
    我们知道，迷信武力并妄图以战争来征服世界的美帝国主义是把它在朝鲜的一切希望寄托在军事力量方面的。在谈判以前，它固然是倾全国陆军和空军的力量来在朝鲜狂轰乱炸，正如在我们抗战中的日本帝国主义一样，希望以狂轰乱炸来摧毁人民抵抗的意志。就是在谈判之中，它也是左一个夏季攻势，右一个秋季攻势。美国首席代表乔埃天天在谈判中夸耀他们的所谓“军事压力”，希望以这种所谓的“压力”，来帮助他们在谈判中讨得便宜。但是尽管他们夸耀压力，他们却早已知道这个压力是靠不住的。仅仅在从一九五○年十月二十五日到今年十月十日的十一个半月中，我方一共毙伤俘敌军达三十八万七千余名，其中光是美军就占了十七万六千余名。美国所倚赖的空军在十一个半月中被击落、击伤和缴获的飞机是二千三百余架。特别是自从美国的所谓秋季攻势以来，美方在飞机方面的损失大大增加，美国整个统治阶级被我方空军威力的强大以及他们自己的飞机的损失所震动。美国空军参谋长范顿伯在特别为此来到朝鲜，研究了情况之后，不得不于十一月二十一日的记者招待会上公开承认“空中的情势可能变得严重，甚至危急”；“假如没有我们在空中的支配性地位，我们几乎必然早已被赶出朝鲜去了。”由此可知，美国在朝鲜的心病是它的武装力量与它的侵略企图严重地不相配合。一方面，它看见了我方人民空军日益增长的当前威胁感到恐惧；另一方面，它又不肯因承认困难的增加而停止其侵略朝鲜的企图。因此，只好希望混水摸鱼，一时说要限制我方全部的军事设备，一时又说是要限制飞机场和有关设备；一时要不许增加军事装备，一时又强调不许增加飞机；一时要到处视察，一时又特别指定要视察空运港口，杯弓蛇影，处处皆兵。并且明知这些都是干涉朝鲜内政，损坏朝鲜主权的不法要求，是说不出正当理由的，于是信口开河，说了是为保证停战协定的稳定，又要扯上什么完整的主权在今天不存在的谰言，吹嘘什么它在战争中已经限制了我方的设备的诳话。这一切完全是矛盾混乱，自欺欺人。并且为达到其如果不能干涉朝鲜内政就要拖延谈判的目的，采取了对人民对战俘完全不负责任的做法，急急乎要讨论战俘问题，以便利用被俘士兵来就第三项议程作讨价还价的资本，因此，美方一面高声喧嚷说他们如何关心战俘，而在第四项议程的讨论之中，他们反来拒绝讨论迅速释放俘虏的问题，先来索要俘虏名单及红十字国际委员会的视察权利。并在每日的小组会议中，无中生有，节外生枝，尽量拖延。其目的正是为了希望找到口实，造成某种压力，以便对其在第三项议程中的无理要求和拖延办法有所帮助。在这种不负责任不计后果的战术的拖延之下，三十天的谈判期限即将被消耗完结。而美国坚持干涉朝鲜内政的无理要求已经使全世界亿万爱好和平的人民的和平愿望以及千万战俘及其家属的团聚热望遭受了一次重大的打击。这种拖延谈判的后果应该由美帝国主义者担负全部责任。
    至于我方则一贯本着迅速取得停战协议以便和平解决朝鲜问题的主张，认为在停战期间外国军队和外来军事力量只应撤出朝鲜而不能进入朝鲜。我方既无意从朝鲜境外输入军事力量，也绝对不能容忍对朝鲜内政的任何干涉。这是因为我方所要求的不是使战争在朝鲜继续下去，而是要在朝鲜取得停战；不是要在朝鲜保持战争状态，而是要在朝鲜取得和平。我们中国人民将和朝鲜人民一道继续本着我们的一贯主张，为争取一个公平合理的朝鲜停战协定而斗争。假如美帝国主义者由于过度害怕而像一个中风狂走的疯人一样，竟敢从拖延谈判而走向破坏谈判，他们的这一企图必将遭受我们坚强的打击而终于不得不来接受一个公正的和平。
