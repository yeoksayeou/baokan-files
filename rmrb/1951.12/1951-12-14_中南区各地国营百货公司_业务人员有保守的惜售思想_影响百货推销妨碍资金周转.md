    State-owned Department Stores in Central and South China Region
    Business Personnel Have Conservative Reluctance to Sell
    Affecting Department Store Promotion and Hindering Capital Turnover
    Comrade Editor: Although the total sales amount of state-owned department stores in the Central and South China region increased by 6.7% in November compared to October, the average completion rate of the sales target was only 65.98%. This greatly hindered the turnover of capital.

    The reasons for the slow progress of promotion work in department stores in Central and South China are: some business personnel still have conservative reluctance to sell. Wuhan Department Store has 106 kinds of cotton and wool shirts and trousers in stock, but only 27 kinds are displayed for sale in the retail department. There are also unreasonable phenomena in price control. For example, the wholesale price of Huanqiu handkerchiefs in Guangdong Xingmei Department Store is actually 6,000 yuan higher per dozen than the retail price; an electricity meter sells for 1.84 million in Wuhan Department Store, which is also much higher than the market price. In addition, the complicated business procedures and the poor attitude of salespersons in many companies also affect promotion.

    The sales task of department stores in the Central and South China region accounts for a large proportion of the country, and the task in December is even greater. However, judging from the sales in November, department stores in the Central and South China region are far behind other major administrative regions. We believe that in order to accelerate capital turnover and complete the task of promoting department stores, leading cadres of department stores in the Central and South China region must pay attention to clearing the conservative reluctance to sell among some business personnel, and mobilize all affiliated companies to clear inventory and promote department stores suitable for the local area to the general public through various methods, and allocate those unsuitable for the local area to other companies.

    中南区各地国营百货公司
    业务人员有保守的惜售思想
    影响百货推销妨碍资金周转
    编辑同志：中南区各地国营百货公司十一月份总的销货金额虽然比十月份增加百分之六点七，但销货任务平均只完成百分之六十五点九八。这就大大妨碍了资金的周转。
    中南各地百货公司推销工作进展不快的原因是：在业务人员当中还有保守惜售思想。武汉百货公司库存有一百零六种棉毛衫裤，但只摆二十七种在门市部出售。在价格掌握上也有不合理的现象。如广东兴梅百货公司环球手帕的批发价，每打竟比零售价高出六千元；武汉百货公司一个电表卖一百八十四万，也超过市价很多。此外，不少公司业务手续繁复，营业员态度不好，也影响了推销。
    中南区百货销售任务占全国比重很大，十二月份任务更大。但从十一月份销货来看，中南区百货公司和其他各大行政区百货公司比较相差很多。我们认为，为了加速资金周转，完成推销百货的任务，中南区百货公司领导干部必须注意打通某些业务人员的保守惜售思想，并动员所属各公司清查库存，把适合当地的百货用各种办法推销给广大人民，不合本地需要的调拨其他公司。
