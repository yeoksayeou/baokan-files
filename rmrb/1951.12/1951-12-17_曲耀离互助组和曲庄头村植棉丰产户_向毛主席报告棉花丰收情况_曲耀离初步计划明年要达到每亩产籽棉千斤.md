Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group and Quzhuangtou Village Cotton Planting High-Yield Households
Report to Chairman Mao on the Cotton Harvest
Qu Yaoli Tentatively Plans to Achieve 1,000 Jin of Seed Cotton Per Mu Next Year

Respected Chairman Mao:

Our cotton has been harvested, and we are now reporting this year's bumper harvest to you.

Our Quzhuangtou Village planted a total of 1,540 mu of cotton this year, harvesting a total of 410,000 jin of seed cotton. The average yield of seed cotton per mu of irrigated land was 360 jin, exceeding the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan yield by nearly one and a half times; the average yield of seed cotton per mu of dry land was 90 jin, reaching the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan level. In Liujiaxiang Village, where Comrade Qu Yaoli lives, 50 cotton-farming households cultivated 162.94 mu of irrigated cotton fields, harvesting a total of 67,027 jin of seed cotton, averaging 411 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 81 jin compared to last year; 126 mu of dry land (mostly alkaline land) cotton fields, harvested a total of 17,751 jin of seed cotton, averaging 141 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 57.4 liang compared to last year. The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group cultivated 42 mu of irrigated land and 6 mu of dry land cotton fields, harvesting a total of 26,344 jin of seed cotton, averaging 548 jin and 13 liang of seed cotton per mu. Qu Yaoli's own 20 mu of cotton fields harvested a total of 15,202 jin of seed cotton, averaging 760 jin of seed cotton per mu; among which, 2 mu of high-yield land, harvested a total of 1,824 jin of seed cotton, averaging 912 jin of seed cotton per mu, exceeding last year's highest yield record by 167 jin. Under the leadership and promotion of Comrade Qu Yaoli, 11 more high-yield households emerged in the village, averaging over 500 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among them, Gao Jindong's eight mu of irrigated land, averaged 633 jin of seed cotton per mu. Our cotton bolls, which were mostly four-lobed last year and few five-lobed, have become mostly five-lobed this year, with some six-lobed and seven-lobed ones. In the cotton fields of Qu Yaoli, Qu Dejun, and Qu Dianshuan, there also appeared eight-lobed, nine-lobed, and ten-lobed cotton bolls, one cotton boll being as large as two ordinary ones. People in the village and visitors were very happy to see them. We have separately preserved these cotton bolls and plan to sow them separately next year to test and improve the quality of cotton. This year's high yield fact shows that as long as we work hard to carry out the patriotic production movement, we can increase the yield per unit area. This autumn, our village conducted a commendation, summing-up, and labor model election work. The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group was selected as the "Patriotic High-Yield Group", and Qu Yaoli, Gao Jindong, Shangguan Jingyi, Hui Keqin, Liu Pingzhi and other seven people were selected as glorious patriotic high-yield models and substitute farming models. When writing this letter to you, everyone happily said: We must strive to achieve high yields in every household and be models for everyone. We have plowed most of the autumn land once, and also carried out a weeding and aphid prevention work specifically in the cotton fields. Now everyone is starting to formulate next year's patriotic high-yield plan. Qu Yaoli has tentatively planned to create a high-yield record of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu next year.

Respected Chairman Mao: Our cotton has had a bumper harvest. The 50 cotton-farming households in Liujiaxiang Village harvested an average of 380 jin of seed cotton per person, equivalent to more than six shi of grain. We can't even finish eating it all in one year with just the cotton alone. We are preparing to buy livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, and build houses. Most of us are in our decades of age, and have lived in the old society for half our lives. We also grew cotton in the old society, but we have never seen cotton yields exceeding 500 jin, let alone 912 jin, and never thought that cotton bolls would have eight, nine, or ten lobes. Why can we do it today? Respected Chairman Mao, this is the result of your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Under your leadership, Japanese imperialism was defeated, and the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs was overthrown. Land reform was implemented, and this year you are leading us in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, giving us favorable production conditions. The government has also implemented a policy of rewarding cotton planting, stipulating reasonable cotton-grain price ratios, implementing advance purchases, and providing loans, fertilizers, and waterwheels, and guiding cotton planting techniques. Those of us who produce high cotton yields can also go to Beijing to attend meetings and meet with you. This is truly unprecedented. The worker elder brothers also manufacture new-style waterwheels, farm tools, medicines, and sprayers for us. Last year, our village only had 31 waterwheels, and this year it has increased to 66. With these, we were able to achieve high yields. We swear to always follow you, respond to your call, continue to strengthen resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, increase production, and practice strict economy.

We feel that in order to achieve high yields in every household, we must follow the path of organizing ourselves to develop production that you have pointed out to us. The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group, which has only been organized for one year, has demonstrated the power of collective production. This spring, in order to seize the moisture and sow the seeds, the entire group started working separately, and the 48 mu of cotton fields were sown in one day, ensuring full seedlings. If we worked individually, it would take at least three days to plant them. When there was a drought this summer, the group rationally mobilized labor and animal power, so that the six mu of dry land of group member Ye Dianwa was also irrigated twice and was not affected by the drought. In particular, the role of mutual assistance in improving farming techniques is even greater. For example, Ye Dianwa believed that his land was poor and did not need to be topped. After research by the mutual aid group, it was believed that his land was not poor, and if the cotton plants were not topped, they would grow wildly. He accepted the group's opinion and produced more cotton. In order to strive for high yields, Gao Jindong wanted to apply 1,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu. After research by the mutual aid group, it was believed that his land had sufficient fertilizer, and if he applied more topdressing fertilizer, the stems and leaves would grow too vigorously, and the cotton bolls would fall off. Therefore, he did not apply any more topdressing fertilizer, which enabled the cotton to achieve high yields. Gao Jindong said: These are all the benefits of the mutual aid group.

From this year's harvest, we have realized that it is very important to study science and technology. For example, this spring, the Yuncheng Special District Farm told Qu Yaoli: To increase yields, we should accept the advanced scientific experience of "close planting" in the Soviet Union, and each mu of cotton field can retain 4,000 cotton seedlings. At first, Qu Yaoli thought it was too dense and not ventilated, and the lower part of the cotton plants would not see sunlight. Later, Qu Yaoli personally visited the farm and saw that the cultivation method of two rows dense and one row sparse could solve the problem of air and sunlight. His two mu of high-yield cotton fields, which can yield 912 jin, is largely due to the fact that each mu was densely planted with 3,160 plants. This year, everyone here said: "Sparse ones look like *geta* (only see many cotton bolls on the cotton plants, but can't harvest cotton), dense ones pick cotton."

Respected Chairman Mao: We deeply feel the country's love and help for us farmers; we farmers should also love the country. This year, when the country lacked cotton, the government called on people to sell and store cotton, and our entire village sold and stored all the cotton in our possession to the country. Qu Yaoli received the "Patriotic Cotton Selling Model" award flag issued by the county people's government.

I respectfully wish
You good health

    曲耀离互助组和曲庄头村植棉丰产户
    向毛主席报告棉花丰收情况
    曲耀离初步计划明年要达到每亩产籽棉千斤敬爱的毛主席：
    我们的棉花已经收完了，现在把今年丰收的情况向您报告一下。
    我们曲庄头村，今年共种棉花一千五百四十亩，共收籽棉四十一万斤。每亩水地平均收籽棉三百六十斤，超过抗日战争前产量近一倍半；每亩旱地平均收籽棉九十斤，达到抗日战争以前水平。曲耀离同志住的刘家巷自然村，五十户棉农，一百六十二亩九分四厘水地棉田，共收籽棉六万七千零二十七斤，每亩平均收籽棉四百一十一斤，比去年增产八十一斤；一百二十六亩旱地（碱地多）棉田，共收籽棉一万七千七百五十一斤，每亩平均收籽棉一百四十一斤，比去年增产五十七斤四两。曲耀离互助组四十二亩水地和六亩旱地棉田，共收籽棉二万六千三百四十四斤，每亩平均收籽棉五百四十八斤十三两。曲耀离自己的二十亩棉田共收籽棉一万五千二百零二斤，每亩平均收籽棉七百六十斤；其中二亩丰产地，共收籽棉一千八百二十四斤，每亩平均收籽棉九百一十二斤，超过去年最高丰产纪录一百六十七斤。在曲耀离同志带头推动下，全村又出现了十一户丰产户，平均每亩收籽棉在五百斤以上。其中高进东八亩水地，平均收籽棉六百三十三斤。我们的棉桃，去年还是四瓣的多五瓣的少，今年变成了五瓣的多，还有六瓣、七瓣的。曲耀离、曲德俊、曲典拴的棉田里，还出现了八瓣、九瓣、十瓣的棉桃，一个棉桃就有一般的两个大。村里人和参观的人见了都很高兴。我们已把这些棉桃另外保存，准备明年另外播种，试验改进棉花的品质。今年丰产的事实说明了：只要我们努力开展爱国生产运动就可以提高单位面积产量。今年秋天，我村进行了一次评比总结选举劳动模范工作。曲耀离互助组被选为“爱国丰产组”，曲耀离、高进东、上官敬义、惠克勤，刘萍芝等七人被选为光荣的爱国丰产模范和代耕模范。在向您写这封信的时候，大家都高兴地说：我们要争取作到家家丰产，人人模范。我们已把秋地大部耕了一遍，还特别在棉花地里进行了一次除草防蚜工作。现在大家正着手订明年的爱国丰产计划。曲耀离已初步计划明年要创造每亩产一千斤籽棉的丰产纪录。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们的棉花丰产了，刘家巷五十户棉农每人平均收籽棉三百八十斤，合六石多粮食。仅棉花一项一年也吃不完。我们正准备买牲口、农具、肥料和盖房子等。我们大多数是几十岁的人了，半辈子都是活在旧社会里。在旧社会里我们也种棉花，可是我们从来也没有见过棉花能收到五百斤以上，更没有想到能收九百一十二斤，也没想到棉桃还会出现八瓣、九瓣、十瓣。为什么今天能做到呢？敬爱的毛主席，这是您和共产党、人民政府领导的结果。在您领导下，打倒了日本帝国主义，推翻了蒋介石、阎锡山匪帮的统治，实行了土地改革，今年又领导我们抗美援朝、镇压反革命，使我们有了良好的生产条件。政府还实行了奖励种棉的政策，规定合理的棉粮比价，实行预购，并且贷款、贷肥料、贷水车，指导种棉技术。我们种棉丰产的人还能到北京开会和您见面，这真是自古以来没有的。工人老大哥也给我们制造新式水车、农具、药剂、喷雾器等。去年我们村只三十一辆水车，今年就增到六十六辆。有了这些，才使我们取得了丰产。我们宣誓要永远跟着您走，响应您的号召，继续加强抗美援朝，巩固工农联盟，增加生产，厉行节约。
    我们感到，要想家家丰产，就必须走您指示我们的组织起来发展生产的道路。组织起来才一年的曲耀离互助组，就发挥了集体生产的力量。今年春天下种时，为了抢墒下种，全组一齐分头动手，四十八亩棉田，一天便播种完毕，保证了全苗。如果单干，至少得三天才能种上。今年夏天天旱时，组内合理调动了劳力、畜力，使组员叶典娃的六亩旱地，也浇了两水，没有受到旱的影响。特别是互助起来提高耕作技术的作用更大。如叶典娃认为自己的土地薄，不需要打切。经互助组研究，认为他的地并不薄，不打切棉株就会长狂。他接受了组里的意见，多产了棉花。高进东为了争取丰产，每亩要上追肥一千斤。经互助组研究，他的地肥料充足，如再上追肥，茎叶长得太旺，棉桃就要脱落。因此，他没有再施追肥，使棉花达到了丰产。高进东说：这都是互助组的好处。
    从今年丰收中，我们体会到学习科学技术很重要。如今年春天运城专区农场告诉曲耀离说：要增加产量，应该接受苏联“密植”的先进科学经验，每亩棉田可留棉苗四千株。开始曲耀离认为太稠，不透空气，棉株下部见不到阳光。后来曲耀离亲自参观了农场，看见两行稠一行稀的栽培方法，可以解决空气和阳光的问题。他的二亩丰产棉田，产量能达到九百一十二斤，每亩密植三千一百六十株是一个重要原因。今年我们这里人都说：“稀了看圪塔（只看见棉株上结棉桃多，却收不下棉花），稠了摘棉花。”
    敬爱的毛主席：我们深切感受到国家对我们农民的爱护和帮助；我们农民也应该热爱国家。今年国家缺棉花时，政府号召售棉储棉，我们全村就把所存的棉花全部售储给国家。曲耀离得到了县人民政府发给的“爱国售棉模范”奖旗。
        敬祝
  您身体健康
