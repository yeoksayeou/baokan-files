Mr. Mansfield is one of those who helped prepare that famous—and, having heard some things here, I will frankly say, shameful—Act of October 10. However, his lengthy speech here has probably convinced many that we are completely correct in accusing the U.S. government. Despite Mr. Mansfield's willful obfuscation, distortion of facts, insinuation, slander, and defamation of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, everything he said here fully confirms two things: the first is the undeniable fact that the U.S. government's control is meeting with increasing danger, hence the extreme panic of the U.S. government; the second is that the U.S. government is determined to strengthen its interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

Even what is happening at this General Assembly shows that the pressure applied by the United States, the U.S. government, and U.S. monopoly capitalists on some countries is gradually losing its effectiveness. These countries are increasingly aware of the full weight of the unbearable American oppression and are beginning to protest and fight against this oppression in every way they can.

Even everything that has already happened at this General Assembly proves that the assertion of a bourgeois newspaper I cited here is very fair: that in the eyes of the world, America's reputation is ominously declining.

What some representatives have said here—and not only these words, but also the methods used by many countries in the Middle East, Near East, Asia, and Eastern Europe in voting on U.S. proposals (abstention)—has shown that they do not believe your sweet words about peace and peaceful cooperation. This is a lesson that the bigwigs of the Atlantic group should take to heart, and they should consider this lesson, and this lesson should determine their conduct in the Political Committee.

But they obviously haven't understood the meaning of this lesson, although they are likely to understand it soon. The situation is not evolving according to their plans, but according to the internal laws governing the development of social relations. The evolution of the situation will certainly teach them to better and more carefully assess the changes taking place around them, and it will certainly eliminate the arrogant attitude of those who regard themselves as the masters of the world.

What does the American representative want to prove to us here? He drones on and on, constantly repeating those boring fabrications and absurd nonsense about the Iron Curtain, deprivation of human rights, the prevalence of persecution in Eastern European countries, and so on, and contrasts them with the so-called heaven on earth that is widespread in the United States. But please note, and don't forget: in the United States, black people are lynched, and even if they are acquitted by American courts themselves, they are shot on the orders of ordinary police officers. Don't forget: in the United States, black people are not allowed to enter houses reserved for white people. But here someone calls such things human rights, and wants to use them as a cover-up to defend against the accusations currently being made against the United States.

Mr. Mansfield puts all sorts of things together, wanting to prove something that cannot be proven. For example, he said here that we regard every free thought as treason. But this is utter nonsense. It is rather strange that these words should come from his mouth, as I have always held him in higher esteem as a U.S. congressman.

To hear these bigwigs talk, it is as if we consider "free thought" to be treason! But free ideals and freedom itself are what the Russian people and other nationalities living in Russia fought for even before the revolution. And they triumphed, establishing true freedom illuminated by the brilliance of the October Socialist Revolution! But the "freedom" prevalent in the United States that U.S. congressmen praise here is the freedom of the dollar, the freedom to starve to death, the freedom to be unemployed, the freedom to be intimidated by all sorts of Al Capones and Pendergasts, and by those "bosses" who can even control and determine the outcome of U.S. presidential elections! We do not recognize this "freedom," we will never recognize it!

Some people talk to us a lot about "freedom" and "democratic rights," but in their own countries, gangsters like Al Capone and Pendergast run rampant. No one dares deny this. Then you should at least feel ashamed and not claim to be models of true freedom and true democracy!

The U.S. Army transport plane's intrusion into the Romanian-Hungarian border is obviously a preparation for war by the North Atlantic Group.

Mansfield rambled on about the Soviet Union. The American pilots—you see, they "accidentally" lost their way, disappeared, and were arrested! But this is a worthless fabrication, because the pilots who were actually arrested were on reconnaissance and espionage missions. Indeed, in our country, secret agents and spies are not respected, and American spies are not respected either. Our laws do not consider American spies to be exceptions. According to our laws, such pilots are to be arrested, interrogated, sentenced, and even executed. Perhaps Mansfield is referring to the recent incident in which our pilots forced an American "transport plane" to land. I will discuss this matter in more detail than the U.S. delegation might expect. Indeed, not long ago, a U.S. Army transport plane intruded into the Romanian border in the Resita area, flew over Romanian territory, and then intruded into the Hungarian border in the Giula area, attempting to continue flying over Hungarian territory. In order to carry out its reconnaissance and espionage mission, this plane flew into the area where Soviet aircraft were stationed in accordance with Article 22 of the peace treaty with Hungary, and was indeed forced to land by Soviet pilots and Soviet fighter planes on duty. The pilots in the plane were immediately arrested.

The crew was interrogated. They were: Captain Henderson, the pilot; Captain Swift, the co-pilot; Sergeant Duff, the flight mechanic; and Sergeant Albert-Ilyem, the radio operator. The interrogation showed that the Army transport plane belonged to the 85th Regiment of the 12th Air Force of the United States. Then the question arises, why did this plane belonging to the U.S. Air Force, a part of the U.S. Air Force—the 85th Regiment of the 12th Air Force, fly over the territories of Romania and Hungary? Why? We might well ask:

Couldn't you find other secluded and shady places to take a walk?

If you think this is impossible, then we ourselves must take measures to prevent American spies from daring to fly over foreign airspace. This is not Britain and France, which allow people to fly over their airspace, and not only allow them to fly over their airspace, but also allow them to build military bases and military-atomic bases at will on their territory, and do whatever they want there; Mr. Churchill spoke about these bases, and he was referring to the American bases in Britain at that time.

After inspection, it was determined that the U.S. Army transport plane was intact and undamaged. Therefore, this was not an accidental landing or an accidental departure from the normal route; the communication equipment, navigation equipment, and the machinery for flying in very bad weather and at night were all in good condition. The results of the investigation into the route of the plane and the fact that there were skilled personnel on the plane proved that the Army transport plane was deliberately flying over restricted areas for specific reconnaissance purposes. After inspecting the plane, military operational maps of the most important areas of the Soviet Union were found, including military operational maps of the Ukrainian Republic—Comrade Baranovsky, I will tell you about this matter...(The Ukrainian representative said: I already know about it)...as well as maps of the Volga region, maps of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Hungary. The question arises: why did this plane need maps of various regions of the above-mentioned countries? Let Mr. Mansfield explain it! A portable radio transceiver, wrapped in padding and equipped with airdrop devices, was also found on the plane. This was not for use on the plane, but for use in the field. The American authorities said that portable radio transceivers are necessary on the plane in the event of an accident, when the pilots are forced to parachute down. They even tried to explain it this way.

However, this explanation is of course absolutely absurd, because, first of all, one should not fly in places where flying is not allowed. Secondly, there was probably no need to parachute in the area where this plane was flying. There was no need for it to fly there at all. As a result, a very strange logic arises here: it is impossible to make a legal flight in this direction, but this plane did fly, and it carried portable radio equipment that is only needed when one must parachute down. If it was legal to fly and carry these devices, then this plane should not have chosen this route, which was not pre-determined and not legal. If so, we would have no reason to arrest the pilots; but Mansfield said that these pilots had completely disappeared!...Although there were only four pilots in total, six parachutes were found on the plane. Furthermore, the number of parachutes and their placement on the plane showed that these parachutes were definitely not for the use of the crew, but for some other purpose. Finally, several packages were found on the plane, with a total of twenty blankets. These were ready to be dropped from the plane. What is this? Is this all a coincidence?

Mr. Mansfield, I assure you that these pilots have been arrested and have received the appropriate attention from our border military authorities. And I hope that they will receive the due attention of the relevant judicial organs, because these pilots were flying for reconnaissance, carrying out the tasks assigned to them by your Atlantic Group, and trying to complete the plans of this group. It is for this reason that when the American representative said with emotion—he expressed emotion towards our side—look, our pilots, or, in his words, the pilots of our country are encountering such and such a situation in the Soviet Union, when he said this, I must say that his emotion is false and does not correspond to the actual situation. In this case, we can give the simplest and clearest explanation: in all other cases, if American pilots fly over Soviet territory, take various photos of our border, take photos of various targets that they are interested in, and generally speaking, if they conduct reconnaissance, we will also give the simplest and clearest explanation: this is clearly part of the so-called entire "defensive" system plan of the Atlantic Group—this is not "defense," but preparation for another world war.

The facts listed in books such as "Truth About American Diplomats" cannot be denied by the US representative.

Mansfield said that journalists from free countries are regarded as spies in the Soviet Union. This is not true. Our country has never regarded honest journalists as spies, and honest journalists have always enjoyed all the privileges of freedom of the press in the Soviet Union. However, if a journalist wants to engage in the kind of activities that the pilots of that American Army plane did and play the role of a so-called "journalist," he will of course be interrogated by us now and in the future, because spies and secret agents have never been tolerated in our country, and will not be tolerated in the future. As for what the real situation is in this regard, I advise Mansfield and his colleagues to at least take advantage of the Christmas holidays and spend an hour or so reading a book by Booker, who was one of the former responsible officials of the American Embassy in Moscow, the former director of the embassy's press office. Booker wrote a book entitled "Truth About American Diplomats." From this book they will learn something useful, perhaps they will learn basic honesty, so they will know how to restrain themselves and not shout and slander as Mansfield does.

Perhaps Booker will evoke some unpleasant memories for some people, making them feel a little sad and unable to consider the issue calmly. I can also recommend another book, such as the book by the famous British journalist Pike. Presumably Mr. Lloyd has heard his name, and if he has not heard of it, it is a great pity. I can give him this book. He can also take a look at this book. It will definitely not be without benefit to him.

In his book "Conspiracy Against Peace," Pike described the "skills" of those spies who gathered in Moscow during his tenure at the British Embassy in Moscow. In this book, Pike described what the British spies, wearing diplomatic tuxedos and using diplomatic passports to cover up their activities, did.

Many of these are facts that I do not even want to quote or mention here. The reason I have to mention these facts now is because these people are not from us, but from you; they are not working in our agencies, but are your confidant representatives whom you sent to carry out diplomatic activities. But later they refused to return home and wrote documentary works exposing the various unspeakable and criminal acts of American—and, by the way, British—diplomatic personnel in the various people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union. You should read these books. You should try to deny the facts in these books, even if it is only one fact.

The U.S., British, and French governments unreasonably detain Soviet refugees and children, and attempt to use them as mercenaries.

Mansfield said here—not said, but shouted—that hundreds of thousands of people refuse to return to our country. So, those people we sent back home refused to return home! This is really strange! This is a blatant lie. Honestly, have the U.S. government, the British authorities, and the French government, notorious for their shameful activities in the "Polica" wartime refugee camps in France, ever allowed our repatriation officers to contact our citizens in these wartime refugee camps and help them escape the imprisonment they were in after the war? Indeed, they found themselves not imprisoned by the Germans they had fought against, but by the French, British, and Americans in camps set up for so-called wartime refugees in Western Europe. Have you not tried every possible means to prevent them from establishing and maintaining contact with our specially appointed repatriation officers, and constantly obstructed their return home, keeping these people under your influence and control? You have managed to detain these hundreds of thousands of people in your hands, so that you can later use them as hired laborers and mercenaries, as you are doing now. You use the law to cover up this action, initially the August Law, and later the October 10, 1951 Law.

Despite all our efforts to establish free contact with our compatriots, despite all our efforts to enable them to return to their homeland, we are obstructed, we are obstructed in every possible way, and we encounter thousands and thousands of new obstacles. Now, you yourselves dare to insist that thousands of our people do not want to return to the Soviet Union!

But it is you who are obstructing their return to the Soviet Union. Tear down your walls, remove your obstacles, and lift the iron curtain, the real iron curtain, that separates our compatriots—our citizens who are currently suffering in your so-called wartime refugee camps in West Germany and other countries—from their homeland! Then you will see that as a result of free contact with representatives of the Soviet Union, these thousands and thousands of people, our brothers and sisters, will return to their beloved homeland in large numbers!

You detain our children. You are trying these cases in American courts: whether these children—our Soviet children—can be returned to their parents who are demanding the return of their children, whether these children can be sent home to reunite with their families.

You are organizing trials in the United States. In these trials, you deny us the right to demand that these children be returned to their parents, who are all firmly demanding the return of their children.

These are all facts. But after you have done all this, you dare to slander our country here and insult it at will, even though you and our country still maintain normal so-called diplomatic relations.

The United States spent a lot of money thirty years ago to carry out armed intervention in Soviet Russia, and it still has not given up.

We already know these plans to "liberate" our people. These plans began the day after the victory of the Great October Revolution. At that time, you also believed that your task was to "liberate" the workers and peasants of Russia from the Soviet regime. To achieve this goal, you launched an armed intervention in Soviet Russia, and your money flowed like a river into the pockets of the White Guard generals. This was to help...who? It was to help Bulak-Bulakhovich, Yudenich, Denikin, Kolchak, Krasnov, Chaikovsky, the Mensheviks, the White Socialist Revolutionaries, saboteurs, and terrorists!

You tried to do this thirty years ago. American gentlemen, this has already cost you a lot of money! At that time, you shouted that you wanted to "save" the Russians and "liberate" Russia, and you also wanted to use these words to cover up yourselves.

But the October Revolution was a great historical action that liberated the Russian nation and the many other nationalities living in the Soviet Union from the rule of the landlords and capitalists, who had sold Russia to foreign monopoly capitalists, including American bankers and monopoly capitalists.

What did Mr. Mansfield tell us here? He did not talk about the essence of the issue at all, he carefully avoided talking about the facts that would expose American interference in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and other countries. However, he did talk a lot, but he dragged in too many other things, and he tried to prove everything that had nothing to do with the issue we were discussing. He obviously forgot (if he knew) a French proverb, which says: "He who proves too much, proves nothing."

In fact, he greatly praised traitors and war criminals, and did not mention the substance of the issue at all. He slandered the Soviet Union in every possible way. He propagated here that without American aid, the Soviet Union would perish due to poverty and ignorance, enslavement and chaos. But please take a look at what the situation in the Soviet Union is like today, and what the situation in the Soviet Union was like twenty years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, and two years ago. The strength of the Soviet Union is gradually increasing year by year, it is gradually developing economically, and its science, engineering, art, and culture are becoming more and more developed. The Soviet Union has completely freed itself from economic dependence on foreign countries. It has raised the welfare of the Russian people, who are united like brothers and sisters and have established a great socialist country, as well as the many other nationalities living in the great Soviet Union, to a level unprecedented in Russian history.

The Soviet Union has not spent hundreds of billions of dollars on guns and cannons—in the words of the famous Wilson, guns and cannons should replace butter; the American people cannot eat butter, they can only eat margarine at most. In our Soviet Union, there is not only enough butter to eat, but there is also a surplus; if you Americans are smarter and do business with us, you will benefit much more than you will benefit from the "margarine" speech you heard from Mr. Mansfield here today.

But let us assume that you cannot help but do this, because you are acting on orders. If that is the case, then what have you proved here? You have only proved that you cannot tolerate what the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are doing. It is precisely because you cannot tolerate what the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are doing that you cannot peacefully allow the new life in these countries to become better day by day; it is precisely for this reason that you believe it is necessary to actively interfere in our internal affairs. Your entire speech proves this. You say: We can no longer tolerate this situation, therefore we are organizing forces to change this situation. This is the meaning of your speech.

No matter what excuses the U.S. government makes for violating the 1933 U.S.-Soviet Agreement, it cannot escape this responsibility.

So, what is the essence of the crime of you, the U.S. Congressman?

Your crime is interfering in our internal affairs. You say: We don't like what is being done in your country, we can't tolerate what is being done in your country, therefore we interfere in your internal affairs. But we did not ask you why you want to interfere—we know why you want to interfere, we are just telling you: you are interfering in our internal affairs, but you don't dare to do so. Your lengthy statement only proves one point, which is that you are indeed interfering in our internal affairs, and you hope to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. But we cannot but warn you: we will not allow you to interfere in our internal affairs, no matter how much you hope to do so. I will say it again: you hope to interfere in our internal affairs, and you plan to interfere in our internal affairs. You have completely proven this here.

Of course, you had to resort to all kinds of nonsense here—first of all, you brought up the Comintern, and after the Comintern was dissolved, you brought up the Cominform.

Now you are bringing up the Soviet government. You obviously do not know that the late Zhdanov never served as an official of the Soviet government. Zhdanov was the secretary of the Central Committee of the Party. You are completely wrong to confuse the government and the Party. The Party is the Party, and the government is the government.

When you act on behalf of the government, when you formulate laws that are incompatible with the basic standards of international law and with the normal relations between other countries, then the question arises of the government's responsibility for acting in this way.

Of course, we will not criticize the activities of the Comintern or the communist parties of other countries, we ourselves are communists. But that is one issue, the activities of the government is another issue, and formulating laws against the governments of other countries—laws that are aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and that completely constitute acts of aggression—that is another issue. But has Mr. Mansfield said a word to indicate that the Act of October 10 is not directed against the Soviet system, the Soviet state, and the Soviet government? No, he did not say that. He only said that fifteen years ago, the Soviet Union itself took some action that violated the 1933 Agreement, and later the U.S. government protested this matter. Mansfield again evaded the main issue. The method he adopted in this regard is like a person saying in response to another person's accusation: you did the same thing yourself, you are the same way!...

This is the essence of the American representative's reply! We said to you: "You violated the 1933 Agreement that you signed." People replied to us: "You yourselves violated it fifteen years ago." But the question now is: are you violating this Agreement now? Answer this question!

Let us assume that we have violated it. For this matter, the chairman has told us not to deviate from the topic. Let us assume that this is the case—I am not admitting this, I deny this, and I will prove to you later that we have never violated any agreement that we have signed—but let us temporarily assume that we violated that Agreement. But that is in the past. Now I am asking you: "Have you violated the 1933 Agreement?"

You violated the 1933 Agreement. What evidence do we have? The evidence is here!

The 1933 Agreement clearly states what I have quoted here and will quote again. Now we will discuss Section 3 of the 1933 Agreement, which states that neither government shall "organize, finance, support, or permit the existence on its territory of military organizations or groups whose purpose is to engage in armed struggle against the other government."

Did you sign this Agreement with us? Yes, you signed it! Are you complying with this Agreement now? This is the question we are asking you. And we are not even asking this question, but simply saying: you are violating this Agreement, because you are organizing destructive groups, but the Agreement states "shall not organize"; you are financing these groups—appropriating one hundred million dollars, which is not a small amount—but the Agreement states: "shall not finance"; you are supporting these groups, but the Agreement states: "shall not support"; you now allow these groups to exist on your territory, but the Agreement states: "shall not permit." I want to ask: are these two things compatible with each other? We believe that they are incompatible. We believe that if this is the case, then you have now violated the 1933 Agreement. No matter what excuses or sophistry you use, you cannot escape this responsibility.

This situation can never and will never allow you to escape responsibility for this issue, which is the current issue. You must be responsible for this situation, or else change your policy, or else revoke this law that constitutes a violation of the aforementioned Agreement, or else you must say: "We believe that this Agreement has been invalidated."

But you do not have the courage or the necessary sincerity to correct your mistakes. You insist on this mistake. Mansfield's speech is full of all kinds of absurd lies and nonsense. When he was telling these fairy tales, there was only one thing he had not done yet, and that was: he had not specially concocted some so-called Russian proverbs in order to achieve his goals. We should mention in passing the sentence proposed by Mr. Lloyd, which is said to be a Russian proverb: "The more the cow shouts, the less milk it produces." There is no such proverb at all. Mr. Lloyd, are you very embarrassed? One cannot help but doubt why you fell in love with this "proverb" so quickly, because you should understand that physiologically, there is no relationship between the cow's shouting and the amount of milk the cow produces. Of course, I am not a veterinarian, but anyone who knows a little about animal biology will easily understand that there cannot be such a proverb, because it would be ridiculous to say that the cow's milk production is determined by the cow's shouting.

This is like saying—for example—the more people talk, the less likely they are to have children. But I think there is no relationship between these two things and there cannot be. I am very sorry that the Argentine representative Mr. Yass is not here. He is a famous diplomat, internist, and obstetrician. If he were here, he would definitely support me completely on this issue.

But now, I think it seems that I should mention this real Russian proverb about cows, but that would involve Mr. Mansfield's speech. For his speech, we can use this proverb: "It neither shouts nor calves."

Now let us go back to the essence of the issue. The question is: what is currently happening in the United States and in American legislative bodies? We can assure you that if the things there did not affect us, we would absolutely not care, but they do affect us, because the United States has promulgated and implemented a law that says:

"We hereby allocate one hundred million dollars for such and such purposes"... What purposes? It is precisely for those activities that are prohibited by the 1933 U.S.-Soviet Agreement. Can you deny this? Mr. Mansfield cannot deny this. No matter what methods he invents, he cannot deny it, and he does not dare to deny it.

The U.S. representative admits that he is recruiting "refugees" to form armed forces and incorporate them into the North Atlantic aggressive group.

We are now talking about this Agreement. This Agreement states that both the Soviet Union and the United States guarantee not to allow personnel to be recruited and such organizations and groups to be organized on their territory. The United States guarantees not to allow such personnel to be recruited on its territory. But Mr. Mansfield admits that such recruitment is taking place in the United States. He said that the law passed on October 10 aims to help "fugitives" who are persecuted for political reasons to participate in the defense of the North Atlantic Group. He explained that the Kersten Amendment refers to "specially selected personnel" residing in Eastern European countries or "fugitives" who have fled from these countries. However, this is tantamount to admitting that their purpose is to recruit so-called "fugitives" and use them to form "armed forces" so that they can "assist" the Atlantic Group, which Mansfield describes as defensive. We do not intend to argue about whether your group is aggressive. Let us assume that the facts are indeed as you say, "for self-defense." But who is this group formed to "defend" against? To defend against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. To deal with whom? To deal with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. But it must be remembered that according to the 1933 Agreement, the U.S. government promised not to organize such groups in its country! According to this Agreement, it has the obligation not to allow these groups to exist, and it has the obligation to prevent them from organizing such groups in its country. Here, the United States violated this Agreement. Mansfield cannot refute this fact, but he tried to defend himself, so he talked a lot about the purpose of "defense," and the U.S. government, under this pretext, is not afraid to violate the aforementioned Agreement. But no matter what the motive, the fact remains: the U.S. government violated the 1933 Agreement, and it violated this Agreement extremely viciously. Everything that Mansfield said completely confirmed our accusation against the U.S. government. We accuse that the United States has formulated a law that allows the recruitment of our citizens, and also allows the recruitment of Hungarians, Romanians, Poles, Czechs, and "fugitives," to organize military groups in the United States, and even to organize such groups in our country—they intend to choose places in our country that they consider convenient, and drop spies and paratroopers down by plane, hoping that they will be able to escape our sharp eyes in these places to organize such groups—in order to use these groups or entire military organizations to fight against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Can Mr. Mansfield deny these facts? I intend to talk about these facts in more detail later. These facts undoubtedly show that the U.S. government finances these groups, arms them, and prepares them to conduct subversive activities in the Soviet Union and the above-mentioned other countries. The most important fact that proves this is the law that authorizes the U.S. government to allocate one hundred million dollars to finance the establishment of such groups. The U.S. government not only supports these groups, but also actively organizes them. The U.S. government allows these groups and military organizations whose purpose is to participate in the armed struggle against the Soviet Union to exist in the United States.

What evidence do we have about this matter? I will talk about this issue immediately, but before that, I would like to talk in more detail about the remarks of Mr. Mansfield himself and his colleague Vorys—these two congressmen who have made a great show here—and talk about the public statements they made at a press conference specially held to explain the Act of October 10 regarding this law. The two of them said that there is no aggressive act in this law, no threat to the Soviet Union or any people's democratic country, and in general, there is nothing in this law that is sufficient to confirm the accusation that the United States is interfering in their internal affairs.

However, at this press conference, Mr. Mansfield or Vorys—it is difficult to say which of the two said what, because what each of them said was not published separately, but was published in general—Mansfield and Vorys said that this law stipulates that those who have fled from the above-mentioned countries (it would be right to simply call them rascals) have the opportunity to work together with the troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Act of October 10 stipulates the allocation of one hundred million dollars precisely to organize these military organizations.

It is important to point out that both of these congressmen—Mansfield and Vorys—participated in the drafting of this law, and especially voted in favor of this law. Therefore, they are directly responsible for the emergence of this law, and in fact they also admitted at the press conference that the purpose of the Act of October 10 is to recruit refugees who have fled from these countries (I should add that these people are traitors to their motherland), organize armed forces, and incorporate them into foreign troops whose purpose is not defense but attack. They call the armed forces of the Atlantic Group the Atlantic Treaty "defensive" troops, thinking that this can cover up its aggressive nature. But this is disguise and deception. Mr. Mansfield and Mr. Vorys have indeed admitted that the purpose of this law is to recruit these people so that they can assist the armed forces of the Atlantic Group in the struggle they are preparing for in accordance with the purposes of the Atlantic Group.

Dulles also shouted loudly to incorporate traitors into an "attacking force" to attack the Soviet Union.

Naturally, the position expressed by these two congressmen at the press conference forced them to remain silent about the true conspiracy and purpose of the law authorizing the government to allocate one hundred million dollars. However, others shouted loudly and defended these conspiracies and purposes, especially Dulles, whom we all know has also shouted this way. Mr. Dulles expressed his opinion on this issue very firmly and definitively at a banquet held by the Detroit Advertising Association on November 27. In his speech (I am quoting the original text of Dulles' speech published in the "New York Herald Tribune"), Dulles advocated the establishment of what he called a powerful attacking force. The English version of this speech is like this (Vyshinsky reads the English original—TASS note), and we are now translating it into Russian. He said that establishing a "powerful attacking force" in convenient locations around the Soviet Union is more necessary for every country threatened by the Soviet Union than establishing defensive forces. Of course, it is nonsense to say that the Soviet Union threatens anyone, and it is false and defamatory propaganda that is hostile to the Soviet Union. But isn't this a blatant demand to establish those bandit troops that these American gentlemen are now pinning their hopes on, and isn't it the same as the situation during the Soviet intervention in 1917-1918? In their view, the entire task now is to organize an armed force of 25,000 people and turn these people into a "powerful attacking force" located in convenient locations, as Dulles said, so that it can attack the Soviet Union when necessary.

Isn't this a preparation for war? If they are drafting plans to attack the Soviet Union in order to destroy what they call the "Kremlin regime," isn't this interfering in our internal affairs? This is an impossible task! Because there is no force in the world that can accomplish such a task!

What else did this Mr. Dulles propose? He proposed strengthening cooperation in restoration work and creative work to transform the world much better than it is now, so that no one in the world would listen to the communists. This is a cry to destroy the communist world, that is to say: to destroy those countries where communists live, work, create, build new things, and move towards the great goal of world communism. To "destroy"—this is what Mr. Dulles said, and he also said that some other way must be found to stop the Red Army, and do not try to resist them with "man against man, gun against gun, tank against tank" anywhere on land. Dulles believes that this is an impossible task to accomplish in the future when fighting against the Soviet Union. Obviously, he believes that their tanks cannot defeat our tanks, their guns cannot defeat our guns, and their soldiers cannot defeat our soldiers; because he has no guarantee that his soldiers will still be his soldiers in the future, and will not become our soldiers!

This is what the sharp-eyed Dulles, the insightful Dulles, the think tank of the State Department and all of you, is talking about, and this is precisely what makes him feel confused. This Dulles is looking for other ways, thinking that this will enable him to accomplish the task that troubles him. How to do it? By corrupting people's souls. He wants to adopt the method of corrupting the minds of the people in their hands, degrading their thoughts, losing their will and conscience, and making these people succumb to their evil intentions. By what means? With the help of bribery and treason, using the dregs of all mankind—traitors, war criminals, using the poverty and hunger of thousands and thousands of unfortunate people, these people are sold in batches and individually by you in many countries like cart-pulling livestock.

    论美利坚合众国的侵略行动和对其他国家内政的干涉
    ——安·扬·维辛斯基一九五一年十二月十九日在联合国大会政治委员会上的演说
    孟斯菲尔德先生是那些人里面的一个，他们帮助准备了那个著名的——而且，在这里听了一些话以后，我就要坦率地说，是可耻的——十月十日法，可是，他在这里发表的冗长演讲大概已经使许多人相信我们在这里控诉美国政府是完全正确的了。尽管孟斯菲尔德先生恣意混淆是非，颠倒黑白，含沙射影，诽谤诬蔑苏联和苏联政府，可是他在这里所说的一切，却完全证实了两件事：第一件事就是这样一个无可辩驳的事实，即美国政府的控制权遇到了越来越大的危险，因此美国政府就极其慌张；第二件事就是美国政府已经决心加强对其他国家内政的干涉。
    甚至本届大会上正在发生的事情也表明：美国、美国政府、美国垄断资本家对一些国家施用压力，渐渐不灵了。这些国家愈来愈了解难以忍受的美国压迫的全部重量，正在开始用力所能及的各种方法，对这种压迫提出抗议，进行斗争。
    甚至本届大会上已经发生的一切，也证明我在这里援引过的一家资产阶级报纸的论断是很公允的，这家报纸说，在全世界的心目中，美国的声誉正在不祥地跌落下去。
    有些代表在这里所说的话——而且不仅是这些话，还有中东、近东、亚洲和东欧许多国家在表决美国提案时所使用的方法（弃权）——已经表明他们不相信你们嘴巴上的什么和平呀、和平合作呀的甜言蜜语了。这一点原是大西洋集团的大人先生们应该引为教训的，他们应该对这种教训加以考虑，而这种教训也应该会决定他们在政治委员会上的行径。
    可是他们显然没有了解到这种教训的意义，虽然他们很可能不久就会了解了。局势不是按照他们的计划演变的，却是按照约制社会关系的发展的内在规律演变的。局势的演变一定会给他们教训，要他们较好地、比较注意地估计他们周围的事态变化，而且一定会使那些以世界霸主自居的人们那种目空
    一切的气焰为之消灭。
    美国这位代表在这里要向我们证明一些什么呢？他唠唠叨叨，不停地反复说什么铁幕呀、剥夺人权呀、在东欧国家迫害盛行呀等等索然无味的捏造和荒诞离奇的胡扯，又用所谓在美国普遍存在的地上天堂来作对比。但是，请注意，千万不要忘记：在美国，黑人遭受私刑，他们即使被美国法庭本身开释了，还会在普通警官的命令下被枪毙。千万不要忘记：在美国，黑人是不得进入白人专用的房屋的。可是这里竟有人把这样的事情叫做人权，想这样来进行掩饰，对美国目前受到的控诉进行辩解。
    孟斯菲尔德先生把各种各样的事情都凑在一起，想要证明无法证明的事。例如他就在这里说过，我们把每一个自由思想都认为是叛国罪行。但是，这是彻头彻尾的胡说八道。这种话竟然从他的嘴里说出来，倒是有点奇怪的，因为他是我以前一直给以较高评价的一个美国众议员。
    听这些大人先生们说起来，倒好像我们认为“自由的思想”是叛国罪行似的！但是自由的理想和自由本身正是俄罗斯人民和住在俄国的其他各族人民在革命以前就为之斗争的。而且，他们胜利了，建立了为十月社会主义革命的光辉所照耀着的真正自由！可是，美国国会议员们在这里所极口赞扬的美国流行的“自由”却是美元的自由，饿死的自由，失业的自由，受各种各样的阿尔·加邦党徒和潘达加斯特党徒以及受那些甚至能控制和决定美国总统选举结果的“老板们”恐吓的自由！这种“自由”，我们不承认，我们决不承认！
    有些人对我们大谈“自由”和“民主权利”，可是在他们自己的国家里，像阿尔·加邦和潘达加斯特之类的匪徒却在横行霸道。这一点是没有人敢否认的。那么你们至少该感到害羞，不敢自称是真正自由和真正民主的模范了吧！
    美国陆军运输机侵入罗匈国境显然是北大西洋集团备战的准备
    孟斯菲尔德胡扯了一大堆关于苏联的话。美国的飞行员们——你们看，他们“偶然”迷失了航路，失踪了，被捕了！但是，这是一种毫无价值的捏造，因为实际上被捕的飞行员是负有侦察和谍报任务的。的确，在我国，密探和间谍是不受尊重的，美国的间谍也不受尊重，我们的法律并不认为美国的间谍应在例外。各位先生们，按照我们的法律，这样的飞行员是要予以逮捕、审讯、判刑，甚至处以死刑的。也许孟斯菲尔德所指的是最近我国飞行员强迫美国“运输机”降落的事件。我还是把这件事谈得比美国代表团可能期望的更详细一些吧。的确，不久以前，美国一架陆军运输机曾在列西塔地区侵入罗马尼亚边境，飞越罗马尼亚领土上空，又在朱拉地区侵入匈牙利边境，企图继续在匈牙利领土上空飞行。这架飞机为了执行它的侦察间谍的任务，就飞入了苏联根据对匈和约第二十二条驻扎在该地的飞机的驻区，并且确实被值勤的苏联飞行员和苏联战斗机强迫降落了。飞机中的飞行员随即被捕。
    机上人员受到讯问。这些人是：机长亨德逊上尉，副驾驶员斯微夫特上尉，航空机械士杜夫上士，无线电报务员阿尔伯—伊廉中士。讯问结果表明：这架陆军运输机隶属于美国第十二航空队第八十五联队。那末，问题就发生了，为什么这架隶属于美国空军，隶属于美国空军的一部分——美国第十二航空队第八十五联队的飞机，要飞越罗马尼亚和匈牙利的领土上空呢？为什么呢？我们倒可以问
    一问：
    难道你们没有可能找到其他僻静阴凉的地方去散步吗？
    如果你们认为这是不可能的，那末，我们自己就
    一定要采取措施，使美国的密探们不敢飞越外国领空。这不是英国和法国，英、法两国是准许人家飞越其领空的，而且不仅准许飞越其领空，还准许人家在其领土上随意建立军事基地和军事—原子基地，在那里为所欲为；邱吉尔先生曾谈到这些基地，他当时指的就是美国在英国的基地。
    这架美国陆军运输机经过检查，已经确定是完整无损的。因此，这不是偶然的降落或是偶然离开了正常航路的事件；通讯设备、航行设备以及供在十分恶劣的天气和夜间飞行使用的机械都是完好的。调查这架飞机航路的结果以及这架飞机上有熟练人员一事，都证明这架陆军运输机是为了特定的侦察目的而故意在禁区上空飞行的。检查飞机后，结果发现了苏联最重要地区的军用作战地图，其中有乌克兰共和国的军用作战地图——巴拉诺夫斯基同志，我把这件事告诉你吧……（乌克兰代表说：我已经知道了这件事）……以及伏尔加地区地图、捷克斯洛伐克地图、罗马尼亚和匈牙利的地图。问题就来了：为什么这架飞机需要上面说的这些国家各个地区的地图呢？让孟斯菲尔德先生来解释解释吧！飞机上还找到了轻便无线电收发报机一部，这部机器用软垫包装，附有空投装置，这不是为了在飞机上使用的，而是为了在野外使用的。美国当局说轻便无线电收发报机是在失事时、在飞行员被迫跳伞降落时飞机上所必需的，他们竟试图这样来解释这件事。
    但是，这种解释当然是绝对无稽的，因为，首先根本就不应该在不准飞行的地方飞行。其次，大概在这架飞机飞行的地区也没有跳伞降落的必要吧，它是根本没有必要到那里去飞行的。结果这里就产生了一个非常奇怪的逻辑：在这个方向作合法的飞行是不可能的，但是这架飞机却确实飞行了，还携带了只是在必须作跳伞降落时才需要的轻便无线电装置。如果说飞行和携带这些装置是合法的，那末，这架飞机根本就不应该选择这条不是预定的、不是合法的航路。如果这样，我们也就没有理由逮捕飞行员了；可是孟斯菲尔德却说这些飞行员完全失踪了！……虽然一共只有四个飞行员，飞机上却找到了六顶降落伞。进一步说，降落伞的数目，降落伞在飞机上放置的位置；都说明这些降落伞决不是供机上人员使用的，而是为了某些其他目的的。最后，飞机上还发现了几个包裹，共有二十条毯子，这些是已经准备好从飞机上投下去的。这是什么呢？这难道都是偶然的吗？
    孟斯菲尔德先生，我敢向你保证，这些飞行员已经逮捕了，他们已受到我们边境军事当局的适当注意。而且，我希望他们会受到有关司法机关的应有的注意，因为这些飞行员的飞行是为了侦察，是执行你们的大西洋集团交给他们的任务，是想完成这个集团的计划。就是因为这个缘故，所以当美国代表感慨地——他是对我方表示感慨的——说道：看吧，我们的飞行员，或是用他的话说，我国的飞行员在苏联正在遭遇到怎样的情况呀，当他这样说的时候，我必须说他那种感慨是虚假的，是不符合实际情况的。在这个场合，我们可以给以最简单明了的说明；在一切其他的场合，如果美国飞行员在苏联领土上空飞行，摄取我国边境的各种照片，摄取他们所注意的各种目标的照片，一般地说，如果他们进行侦察的话，我们也要给以最简单明了的说明：这显然是所谓大西洋集团整个“防御”体系计划中的一部分——这并不是“防御”，而是另一次世界大战的准备。
    “美国外交官真相”等书内所列事实，是美代表不能否认的
    孟斯菲尔德说自由国家的新闻记者在苏联被当作间谍看待。这不是事实。我国从来没有把正直的新闻记者当作间谍看待，正直的新闻记者一向都享有苏联现行的新闻自由方面的一切特权。但是，新闻记者如果要进行那架美国陆军飞机的飞行员所干的那种勾当而扮演所谓“新闻记者”的脚色，当然在现在和将来都要受我方审讯，因为在我们的国家里，对于间谍和密探，在过去、现在和将来都是决不予以容忍的。至于这方面的真正情况如何，我劝孟斯菲尔德和他的同僚们至少利用一下圣诞节假期，花一小时左右的时间来读一读布卡尔的一本书，布卡尔是美国驻苏联莫斯科大使馆从前的负责官员之一、大使馆的前新闻处长。布卡尔写了一本书，题目叫“美国外交官真相”。从这本书里他们会学到某种有益的东西，也许他们会学到基本的诚实，这样，他们就会知所节制，而不像孟斯菲尔德那样吵吵嚷嚷，信口诽谤了。
    或许布卡尔会引起某些人不很愉快的回忆，使他们感到有些悲哀，而不能冷静地考虑问题。我还可以建议另外的书，例如，英国的名记者派克的书。想来劳埃德先生一定听到过他的名字，如果没有听到过，那可是非常遗憾。我可以送给他这本书。他也可以看看这本书。这对他绝不会没有好处的。
    派克在“反和平的阴谋”这本书里描写了他在莫斯科英国大使馆任职期间聚集在莫斯科的那些间谍的“技能”。派克在这本书里描写了英国的间谍们穿着外交官的燕尾服，用外交护照掩护他们的活动，干出怎样的勾当来。
    这许多都是我在这里甚至不愿引用、不愿提到的事实。现在我所以不得不提到这些事实，是因为这些人不是来自我们中间，而是来自你们中间的；不是在我们的机关中工作的，而是你们派他们去进行外交活动的你们的心腹代表。可是后来他们拒绝回国了，并且写出了文献性的著作，揭露美国——附带说一句，还有英国——外交人员在各人民民主国家和苏联的各种见不得人的行为，各种犯罪的行为。你们应当读一读的，就是这些书。你们还是设法否认一下这些书中的事实吧，那怕是否认其中的
    一个事实也好。
    美英法政府无理拘禁苏联难民和儿童，并企图利用他们当雇佣兵
    孟斯菲尔德曾经在这里说——不是说，简直是大叫——数十万人拒绝回到我们的国家里来。这么说来，那末，我们那些被遣送回国的人是拒绝回国喽！这真是怪事！这是弥天大谎。老实说，美国政府、英国当局和因为在法国“波利卡”战时难民营中进行可耻的勾当而臭名远扬的法国政府，有没有准许过我们派去的遣民事务官到这些战时难民营和我国的公民建立联系，并帮助他们摆脱在战争结束后所处的囚禁状态？的确，他们发觉自己不是被他们曾对之作战的德国人囚禁，而是被法国人、英国人和美国人囚禁在为所谓战时难民而设在西欧的营房中。难道你们没有千方百计地阻碍他们和我们特别任命的遣民事务官建立并保持联系，并经常阻挠他们回国，使这些人处在你们的影响与控制之下吗？你们已经设法把这成百成千的人拘禁在你们手下，以便随后利用他们充当受雇者，充当雇佣兵，像你们现在正在作的那样。你们用法律来掩盖这种行动，起初是八月法，后来又有一九五一年的十月十日法。
    尽管我们竭尽一切努力，想和我们的同胞取得自由联系，尽管我们竭尽一切努力，想使他们能回到祖国来，可是我们受到阻挠，我们受到千方百计的阻挠，我们遭遇到成千成万的新的障碍。现在，你们自己竟然硬说我们成千的人民不愿回苏联了！
    但是，正是你们阻挠他们回苏联的。拆除你们的围墙，取消你们的障碍，把那使我们的同胞——目前正在你们在西德及其他若干国家设立的所谓战时难民营中受折磨的我国公民——和祖国隔绝的铁幕，真正铁的幕，揭起来！那时候，你们就会看到：由于与苏联的代表自由来往的结果，这成千成万的人，我们的兄弟姊妹，就会大批大批地返回他们亲爱的祖国了！
    你们把我国的儿童拘留起来。你们正在美国法庭上审理这些问题：是否可以把这些儿童——我们的苏联儿童——交还他们那些要求归还其子女的父母，是否可以把这些儿童送回家去，使他们和自己的家人团聚。
    你们正在美国组织审判。在这些审判中，你们否认我们有权要求把这些儿童交还他们的父母，这些父母们都坚决要求把他们的子女交还他们。
    这些都是事实。可是，你们作出这一切之后，竟然胆敢在这里对我们的国家大肆诽谤，信口污辱，虽然你们和我们的国家仍然保有正常的所谓外交关系。
    美国在三十年前就花了不少的钱武装干涉苏俄，现在仍不死心
    我们已经知道了这些“解放”我国人民的打算。在伟大的十月革命胜利后的第二天，就开始进行这些打算了。那时，你们也是认为你们的任务是从苏维埃政权下“解放”俄国的工人和农民的。为了达到这个目的，你们发动了对苏俄的武装干涉，你们的金元像河水一样流入了白卫军将领们的口袋里，这是为了帮助……谁呢？这是帮助布拉科—布拉克维奇、尤登尼奇、邓尼金、高尔察克、克拉斯诺夫、查科夫斯基、孟什维克分子、白色社会革命党人、阴谋破坏者、恐怖分子！
    三十年前，你们就想方设法这样干了。美国先生们，这已经使你们花了不少的钱呢！当时你们大叫要“拯救”俄罗斯人，“解放”俄国，你们那时也是想用这些话为自己掩饰。
    但是，十月革命是一个伟大的历史行动，这个革命把俄罗斯民族和居住在苏联境内的其他许多民族从地主和资本家的统治下解放了出来，而这些地主和资本家曾经把俄国出卖给外国独占资本家，包括美国的银行家和独占资本家在内。
    孟斯菲尔德先生在这里告诉了我们一些什么呢？他完全没有谈到问题的本质，他小心翼翼地避免谈到那些会暴露美国干涉苏联及其他国家的内政的事实。但是，他谈倒是谈了许多，可是把别的事扯得太多了，他试图证明和我们所讨论的问题毫无关系的一切事。他显然忘记了（如果他知道的话）法国的一个谚语，那个谚语说：“要想证明的太多，就什么也证明不了。”
    实际上他大事颂扬卖国贼和战争罪犯，而完全不提这个问题的实质。他一味诽谤苏联。他在这里宣传说，没有美国的援助，苏联就会因贫困和愚昧、奴役和混乱而灭亡。但是请你们看看今天苏联的情形是怎样，二十年前、十年前、五年前、两年前苏联的情形又是怎样。苏联的力量一年年在逐渐增加，它在经济方面逐渐发展，它的科学、工程、艺术和文化愈来愈发达。苏联已经完全摆脱了对外国的经济依赖。它把像兄弟一样团结一致并建立了伟大的社会主义国家的俄罗斯人民以及其他许许多多居住在伟大的苏联境内的各族人民的福利，提高到俄国历史上空前未有的水平。
    苏联没有把数百亿金钱花在枪炮上——用有名的威尔生的话说，枪炮是应当代替牛油的；美国人民吃不到牛油，他们顶多只能吃到人造牛油。在我们苏联，牛油不但够吃，而且有余；如果你们美国人放聪明些，和我们做做生意，那样你们得到的好处，会比从我们今天在这里听到的你孟斯菲尔德先生的“人造牛油”的演说中得到的好处多得多。
    但是我们姑且假定你不能不这样做，因为你是奉令行事的。如果是那种情形，那末，你在这里证明了什么呢？你只证明你们不能容忍苏联以及人民民主国家正在做的事。正因为你们不能容忍苏联以及人民民主国家正在做的事，你们才不能心平气和地听任这些国家中新的生活一天比一天美好；正因为这样，你们才认为有必要积极干涉我们的内政。你的全篇演说证明了这一点。你说：我们再也不能容忍这种情况，因此我们正在组织力量，来改变这种情况。这就是你的演说的意义所在。
    美政府破坏一九三三年美苏协定无论什么藉口也逃不脱这个责任
    那末，你这位美国国会议员先生的罪名的实质是什么呢？
    你的罪名是干涉我们的内政。你说：我们不喜欢你们国家中正在做的事，我们不能容忍你们国家中正在做的事，因此我们干涉你们的内政。但是，我们并没有问你为什么你们要干涉——我们知道你们为什么要干涉，我们只是对你说：你们在干涉我们的内政，同时又不敢这样做。你的长篇发言只证明了一点，就是你们的确在干涉我们的内政，你们希望干涉其他国家的内政。但是，我们不能不警告你们：我们不容许你们干涉我们的内政，不管你们多么希望这样做。我还要说一遍：你们希望干涉我们的内政，你们打算干涉我们的内政。你在这里已经完全证明了这一点。
    当然，你在这里只好乞灵于各种各样的无稽之谈——首先，你扯到共产国际头上，在共产国际解散以后又扯到共产党与工人党情报局头上。
    现在你又扯到苏联政府头上，你显然完全不知道已故的日丹诺夫从来没有做过苏联政府的官员，日丹诺夫是党中央委员会书记。你把政府和党混为一谈，那真是大错特错了。党是党，政府是政府。
    当你代表政府行事的时候，当你制订与国际法的基本标准以及制订和其他国家的正常关系不相容的法的时候，那就发生了政府照这种方式行事的责任的问题。
    我们当然不会指责共产国际或者其他国家的共产党的活动，我们自己是共产党员。但是那是一个问题，政府的活动是另一个问题，制订反对其他国家的政府的法——以干涉其他国家的内政为目标的完全构成侵略行为的法，那又是另外一个问题。但是孟斯菲尔德先生有没有说一个字来表明十月十日法不是反对苏维埃制度、苏维埃国家和苏维埃政府的呢？没有，他没有这样说，他只说十五年以前苏联自己曾采取某种行动，破坏了一九三三年的协定，后来美国政府对这件事提出抗议。孟斯菲尔德又躲避了主要的问题。他在这方面采取的办法，就像一个人在答复别人的指责时说：你自己也做了同样的事情，你自己也是那样子的呀！……
    美国代表的答复实质上就是这样！我们对你们说：“你们破坏了有你们签字的一九三三年协定。”人家答复我们说：“你们自己十五年前就破坏了它。”可是现在的问题是：现在你们破坏了这个协定没有？答复这一个问题！
    我们姑且假定我们曾经破坏过它。为了这件事情，主席曾经告诉我们不要离开本题。我们假定事实是如此——我可不是承认这事，我否认这事，我以后还要向你们证明我们从来没有破坏我们所签订的任何协定——可让我们暂时假定我们破坏过那个协定。可是那是过去的事。现在我在问你们：“你们到底破坏了一九三三年的协定没有？”
    你们破坏了一九三三年的协定。我们有什么证据呢？证据在这里！
    一九三三年的协定上明明白白地写着我曾在这里引用过而且还要再引用一次的那些话。现在我们举出一九三三年的协定的第三节来谈一谈，那里说：两国中任何一国政府不得“组织、资助、支持或允许其领土上存在以对另一国政府进行武装斗争为目的的军事组织或集团。”
    你们和我们一起签订了这个协定没有？是的，你们签订了！现在你们是不是遵守这个协定呢？这是我们向你们问的问题。而且我们甚至并不是问这一个问题，而是干脆地说：你们破坏了这个协定，因为你们正在组织破坏集团，而协定上说“不得组织”；你们正在资助这些集团——拨款一亿美元，数目不算小啊——可是协定上写着：“不得资助”；你们正在支持这些集团，可是协定上写着：“不得支持”；你们现在允许这些集团在你们的领土上存在，可是协定上写着：“不得允许”。我要问：这两方面是不是彼此相容的呢？我们认为是不相容的。我们认为：如果事实是这样，那末，你们现在就是已经破坏了一九三三年的协定了。无论什么藉口，无论什么诡辩，都不能使你们逃脱这种责任。
    这种情形决不能而且也决不会让你们逃脱对于这个问题的责任，而这个问题就是当前的问题。你们必须对这种情况负责，要不然就改变你们的政策，再不然就撤消你们这种构成破坏上述协定行为的法律，再不然你们就必须说：“我们认为这个协定已经作废了。”
    可是你们没有勇气，没有必要的诚意来纠正你们的错误。你们坚持这种错误。孟斯菲尔德的发言里面充满了种种荒诞的谎言和无稽之谈。他在讲这些童话的时候，只有一件事还没有做，那就是：他还没有为了达到自己的目的特地诌出一些所谓俄国的谚语来。我们附带提一下劳埃德先生所提出来的据说是俄国谚语的这句话“牛叫得越厉害，奶出得越少。”其实根本就没有这样一个谚语。劳埃德先生，你怪难为情吧？人家不能不怀疑你为什么那么快就爱上了这个“谚语”了，因为你应该明白，在生理学上，牛的叫声和牛出奶的数量是没有关系的。固然，我不是兽医，可是稍微懂得动物生物学的人都不难了解这样的谚语是不会有的，因为要说牛的出奶量是决定于牛的叫声，那就滑稽了。
    这就等于说——举个例子——人的话说得越多，就越不能生儿女。可是我想在这两者之间也是没有而且不能有关系的。我很遗憾，因为阿根廷代表亚斯先生不在这里，他是著名的外交家、内科医生和产科医生，他如果在这里，一定会在这个问题上完全支持我的。
    但是，现在，我觉得似乎应该提一下这个关于牛的真正的俄国谚语了，但那就要牵涉到孟斯菲尔德先生的发言。对于他的发言，我们用得上这个谚语：“它既不叫，也不下犊”。
    现在我们还是回过头来看看问题的实质吧。问题是：在美国和美国立法机构里，目前发生些什么事情呢？我们可以向你们保证，假如那里的事情不影响我们，那我们是绝对不在乎的，但是那的确影响了我们，因为美国已经颁布施行一个法，里面说：
    “兹拨款一亿美元，作这样和那样之用”……作什么用呢？正是作一九三三年的美苏协定所禁止的那些活动之用。你们能否认这一点吗？孟斯菲尔德先生不能否认这一点。不论他发明些什么办法，他总是不能否认，而且也不敢否认。
    美代表供认招募“难民”组成武装编入北大西洋侵略集团
    我们现在谈一下这个协定。这个协定说，苏联和美国双方保证，不许在它们的领土上招募人员，组织这样的组织和集团。美国保证不许在它的领土上招募这样的人员。但是孟斯菲尔德先生承认，美国国内正在进行这种招募。他说，十月十日通过的法，目的在帮助因政治原因而被迫害的“逃亡者”，让他们参加北大西洋集团的防务。他解释说，克尔斯坦的修正案所指的是居住在东欧国家境内的“特别挑选的人员”或从这些国家逃出的“逃亡者”。然而，这无异承认，他们的目的是招募所谓“逃亡者”，利用他们组成“武装队伍”，让他们能够“协助”孟斯菲尔德形容为防御性的大西洋集团。我们现在不打算辩论你们这个集团是不是侵略性的。我们姑且假定事实的确像你们所说的那样，是“为了自身的防务”。但是，你们成立这个集团是为了
    “防御”谁呢？防御苏联和人民民主国家。为了对付谁呢？对付苏联和人民民主国家。但是，必须记住，根据一九三三年的协定，美国政府答应了不在它国内组织这样的集团！根据这个协定，它有义务不允许这些集团存在，有义务阻止它们在它国内组织这样的集团。这里，美国破坏了这个协定。孟斯菲尔德不能反驳这个事实，但是他企图替自己辩护，于是大谈什么“防务”的目的，美国政府就是借着这个名义而不怕破坏上述协定的。但是，不论动机怎样，事实终归是事实：美国政府破坏了一九三三年的协定，而且是穷凶极恶地破坏了这协定。孟斯菲尔德所说的一切，完完全全证实了我们对美国政府的指责。我们指责说：美国制定了一项法律，允许招募我国公民，同样允许招募匈牙利人、罗马尼亚人、波兰人、捷克人以及“逃亡者”，在美国境内组织军事集团，甚至在我们的国境内组织这样的集团——他们打算在我国境内选择他们认为方便的地点，用飞机把间谍和伞兵投下来，希望他们在这些地方能够避开我们锐利的眼睛，去组织这样的集团——以便利用这些集团或者整个军事组织来对苏联和人民民主国家作战。
    孟斯菲尔德先生能否认这些事实吗？我打算以后更详细地谈到这些事实。这些事实无可怀疑地表明美国政府资助这些集团，武装它们，并使它们进行准备，以便在苏联和上述其他国家进行颠覆活动。证明这一点的最重要的事实，就是那个授权美国政府拨款一亿美元来资助建立这种集团的法。美国政府不仅支持这些集团，而且主动地组织它们。美国政府允许这些目的在于参加对苏武装斗争的集团和军事组织在美国境内存在。
    关于这事我们有些什么证据呢？我现在马上就要谈到这个问题，但是在这以前，我愿意更详细地谈谈孟斯菲尔德先生本人和他的同事伏利斯——这两位在这里大出风头的议员——的言论，谈谈他们在特别为解释十月十日法而举行的记者招待会上就这法所发表的公开声明。他们两个人说，这法里并没有任何侵略行为，没有对苏联或任何人民民主国家的威胁，总的说来，这法并没有任何地方足以证实美国干涉它们内政的指责。
    但是，在这次记者招待会上，孟斯菲尔德先生或伏利斯——很难说他们两人到底谁说了些什么，因为他们每人说的话并没有单独发表，而是笼统地发表的——孟斯菲尔德和伏利斯说，这个法规定使那些从上述国家逃出的人（干脆把他们叫作流氓坏蛋就对了）有机会和北大西洋公约组织的军队共同努力。十月十日法规定拨款一亿美元，正是为了组织这些军事组织。
    有一点是很重要的，必须指出：这两位议员——孟斯菲尔德和伏利斯都曾参与这法的拟订，尤其是曾经投票赞成这法。所以，对于这个法的出现，他们是要负直接责任的，而事实上他们也在记者招待会上承认，十月十日法的目的，是招募从这些国家逃出来的难民（我应该补充一下，这些人是他们祖国的叛徒），组织武装队伍，编入目的不在防御而在攻击的外国军队里。他们把大西洋集团的武装部队叫作大西洋公约“防御”军队，以为这样就可以掩盖它的侵略性质。但是，这是伪装，是欺骗。孟斯菲尔德和伏利斯两位先生的确已经承认了，这个法的目的是招募这些人，以便在他们按照大西洋集团的目的而准备的斗争中，叫这些人来协助大西洋集团的武装部队。
    杜勒斯也高声喊叫要将卖国贼编成“攻击力量”进攻苏联
    自然，这两位议员在记者招待会上表示的立场迫使他们对于授权政府拨款一亿美元的法的真正阴谋和目的表示缄默。然而，其他的人却高声喊叫，为这些阴谋和目的辩护，特别是杜勒斯，我们都知道他也是这样喊叫过的。杜勒斯先生曾于十一月二十七日在底特律广告协会举行的宴会上非常坚决肯定地发表了对于这个问题的意见。杜勒斯在他的演说里（我是引用“纽约先驱论坛报”上刊载的杜勒斯演说原文）主张建立他所说的强大的攻击力量。这篇演说的英文稿是这样讲的（维辛斯基宣读英文原文——塔斯社注），我们现在把它译成俄文。他说，在苏联周围方便的地点建立“强大的攻击力量”，这对于每个受苏联威胁的国家，都是比建立防御部队更必要的。当然，说苏联威胁任何人，是胡说，是敌视苏联的虚假的诽谤性宣传。但是，难道这不是公然要求建立这些美国先生们现在寄予希望的匪军，和一九一七—一九一八年对苏干涉期间的情形一样吗？根据他们的看法，现在全部任务是：组织二万五千人的武装部队，把这些人变成杜勒斯所说的位于方便的地点的“强大攻击力量”，以便它可以在必要时攻击苏联。
    难道这不是战争准备吗？如果他们正在拟订攻击苏联的计划，以便毁灭他们所说的“克里姆林政权”，难道这不是干涉我们的内政吗？这是完成不了的任务！因为世界上没有一种力量能够完成这样一种任务！
    这位杜勒斯先生还提议干些什么呢？他提议在恢复工作和创造性工作上加强合作，好把世界改造得比现在好得多，那样就会使世界上任何人都不听共产党的话了。这是要求毁灭共产主义世界的叫嚣，就是说：要毁灭那些有共产党人在其中生活、工作、创造、建设新事物并且向着世界大同的伟大目标前进的国家。要“毁灭”——这是杜勒斯先生说的，他还说，必须找出某种其他办法来阻止红军，而不要试图在陆上任何地方用“人对人、炮对炮、坦克对坦克”的办法来抵抗他们。杜勒斯认为这是将来对苏联作斗争时没有希望完成的任务。显然，他相信他们的坦克敌不过我们的坦克，他们的炮敌不过我们的炮，他们的兵敌不过我们的兵；因为他没有把握他的兵将来仍然是他的兵，而不会变成我们的兵！
    这就是眼光敏锐的杜勒斯、有洞察力的杜勒斯、国务院和你们大家的智囊杜勒斯所讲的话，也正是这件事使他感到迷乱。这个杜勒斯正在寻找别的办法，以为这样就能够完成那个使他烦恼的任务。怎样来做呢？用腐蚀人的灵魂的办法。他想采取腐蚀在他们掌握中的人的心灵的方法，使他们的思想堕落，使他们的意志和良心丧失，使这些人屈服于他们的罪恶意图之下。用什么手段呢？借助于贿赂和叛国，利用全人类中的渣滓——卖国贼、战犯，利用成千成万不幸的人们的贫困和饥饿，这些人像拉车的牲畜一样，被你们在许多国家里整批地和零星地贩卖着。
