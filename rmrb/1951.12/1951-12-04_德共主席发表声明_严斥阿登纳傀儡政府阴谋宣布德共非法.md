Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 3rd: According to TASS, the Chairman of the German Communist Party (DKP), Max Reimann, held a press conference in Bonn on November 26th, issuing a statement regarding the Adenauer "government's" proposal to the West German "Constitutional Court" to declare the DKP illegal. Reimann pointed out: The Adenauer government's adoption of this measure proves that it is rapidly turning towards fascist rule, which is very similar to the measures taken by the Papen government in 1932 to suppress the German Communist Party before the establishment of the Hitler fascist dictatorship. Reimann said: Declaring the Communist Party illegal is to ensure the establishment of a German mercenary army and drag Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to prepare for a third world war. The German Communist Party is the only party that defends the West German people from the danger of war. It leads the struggle for peace, against remilitarization, and for the protection of German national interests, and is therefore the main obstacle to the United States' plan to rebuild the German army. Reimann emphasized: The Adenauer government's attack on the German Communist Party is also an attack on the German national interest and on the German people's survival interests. He said: The German Communist Party will continue to fight for the cause of peace and German unity at all costs. The German people's just cause—the struggle for peace and German unification—will surely triumph.

    德共主席发表声明
    严斥阿登纳傀儡政府阴谋宣布德共非法 【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国共产党主席雷曼于十一月二十六日在波恩举行记者招待会，就阿登纳“政府”建议西德“宪法法庭”宣布德共为非法一事发表声明。雷曼指出：阿登纳政府采取这一措施，证明它正在迅速转向法西斯统治方式，这和希特勒法西斯独裁统治建立以前巴本政府在一九三二年镇压德国共产党的措施十分相似。雷曼说：宣布共产党为非法，是为了保证成立德国雇佣军队，并把德国拖进北大西洋集团，以准备第三次世界大战。德国共产党是保卫西德人民免于战争危险的唯一的政党。它领导着争取和平、反对重新军国主义化和维护德国民族利益的斗争，因此是美国实现重建德国军队计划方面的主要障碍。雷曼强调：阿登纳政府对德国共产党的进攻，也就是对德国民族利益和对德国人民生存利益的进攻。他说：德国共产党将不惜一切牺牲，继续为和平事业和德国的统一而奋斗。德国人民的正义事业——争取和平与德国统一的斗争必将胜利。
