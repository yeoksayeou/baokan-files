    In Luojia Lane, Yanhú Administrative Village, Wúdū District, Cháoxiàn County, Northern Anhui, almost every wife was originally a child bride. Zhang Guiying was one of them. Her mother died when she was three years old, and soon after, she went to the Luo family to be a child bride. Later, Guiying's fiancé died, and the Luo family kept her as a "waiting bride." At that time, Guiying was very young and didn't understand much, and because she had nowhere else to go, she had to live a miserable life like an animal. Guiying's "groom" finally arrived, but he was five years younger than her. Guiying was constantly troubled. After Liberation, Guiying was truly happy. She knew that the time had come for the poor to stand up and for equality between men and women. At this time, in Luojia Lane, most people knew that the People's Government was against the abuse of child brides. Guiying's parents-in-law also understood this. Filled with hope, Guiying studied hard and worked actively, and was elected as the head of the sisters' group during the land reform movement. Whenever Guiying met people, she would say, "Someone like me has really lived twenty years in vain." Guiying wanted a divorce, but she still had concerns, mainly because she was afraid of "losing face" for her family. Usually, when she attended meetings and study sessions with the militiamen and village cadres, she was also ridiculed by some backward peasants. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, Guiying knew that interfering with freedom of marriage was against the law, so she resolutely filed for divorce from the Luo family. On the fifth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar this year, Guiying got engaged to a militiaman with the surname Wang. Now, Guiying is even more active in her work and studies.

    童养媳张贵英翻了身
    皖北巢县中苔区武都乡沿湖行政村罗家巷，几乎没有一家的媳妇不是童养媳出身的。张贵英原先也是童养媳。她三岁时死了娘，不久，就到罗家做童养媳。后来贵英的未婚夫死了，罗家又把她留作“等郎媳”。那时，贵英很小，不懂事，又因为无家可归，只好牛马不如地过着苦日子。贵英的“郎”等到了，但比贵英小了五岁。贵英成天苦恼着。解放了，贵英心里可真高兴，她知道：穷人翻身，男女平等的时候到了。这时，在罗家巷，一般人都知道人民政府是反对虐待童养媳的。贵英的公婆心里也有数。贵英怀着希望，努力学习、积极工作，在土地改革运动中被选为姊妹团的团长。贵英每遇到人总是说：“像我这样的人，真白白活了二十岁。”贵英想离婚，但还有顾虑，主要是怕给娘家“丢脸”。平时她和民兵、村干部在一起开会、学习，也受到某些落后农民的冷嘲热讽。婚姻法公布后，贵英知道了干涉婚姻自由是犯法的，便坚决地向罗家提出了离婚。今年夏历十月初五日，贵英和一个王姓的民兵订了婚。现在，贵英工作、学习都更积极了。于承英
