"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition No. 121 is now published.

This issue features an editorial titled "Socialism and Democracy are Invincible," commemorating December 5th – Stalin Constitution Day, stating: The Stalin Constitution specifically demonstrates the greatness of Soviet socialist democracy. Soviet citizens, regardless of their nationality or race, enjoy equal rights in economic, national, cultural, social, or political life. The editorial continues: No bourgeois constitution has, or can have, similar great principles as the Soviet Constitution. Lenin repeatedly stated that bourgeois democracy is merely a guise for the most brutal, most shameless, imperialist robbers preparing to destroy millions of people. The correctness of this description of bourgeois democracy is most vividly demonstrated in today's United States. There, a small group of imperialist rulers run rampant under the guise of "freedom" and "democracy." The American and British imperialists and their lackeys use hypocritical phrases of "freedom" and "peace" as cover to engage in vicious war propaganda, intensify the arms race, and take nakedly aggressive actions against peace-loving people, in order to achieve the American imperialist goal of dominating the world. The editorial concludes: Socialism means peace, meaning friendship between all nations. The Soviet Union's steadfast pursuit of a policy of peace and international security is enthusiastically supported by the people of all countries, who are increasingly convinced that "Socialism and democracy are invincible." (Stalin)

This issue publishes an article by Hidas, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party, titled "The Task of Organizationally and Economically Consolidating Hungarian Production Cooperatives." Hidas said: This year, the average harvest yield of some agricultural cooperatives in Hungary has exceeded the highest yields of small farmers or former landlord estates. In many places, preliminary distribution plans for cooperatives have been announced. These plans show that in efficient cooperatives, the income of each member exceeds the average income of middle peasants, while the income of public accumulation funds also increases accordingly. Hidas pointed out: Although the overall harvest of agricultural cooperatives is better than that of individual farmers, they are far from realizing their full potential. In order to achieve a complete victory in the socialist transformation of our agriculture, in addition to turning the best production cooperatives into true model farms, it is also necessary to ensure that all production cooperatives can quickly emulate the best production cooperatives. Secondly, a crucial condition for the development of cooperatives is better leadership. The Party and the government are taking all measures to ensure that cooperative chairmen and work team leaders quickly acquire the specialized knowledge necessary to manage large farms. Finally, machine tractor stations and state farms must provide more assistance to the cooperatives.

This issue publishes an article by Montagnana, a member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, titled "The Italian Working People's Struggle to Improve Their Living Standards." Montagnana said: The real wages of Italian working people fell to their lowest level in 1938. Now, according to official statistics, the average real wages of Italian workers and staff have just reached the 1938 level, while the number of unemployed is much higher than in 1938. According to official statistics, the average per capita consumption should be at least 3,000 calories per day, while the current average level does not exceed 2,367 calories. The wages paid to workers by capitalists are sometimes less than 300 lira (Italian currency) per day, although each family needs at least 2,100 lira per day. This is why the working people, led by the working class, have enthusiastically responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labor and resolutely stood up to fight against the expansion of armaments and to strive for improved living standards. Working people of various political beliefs, both organized and unorganized, have expressed their fighting will in mass rallies held everywhere. In the course of their struggle, the working people, on the one hand, demand increased wages, and at the same time, they need to save various enterprises from the government's closure policies, prevent mass layoffs, and stop the shift of civilian production to the war track. Montagnana concluded: The Italian working people's struggle for bread and decent living conditions continues. Workers in all sectors of the entire industry are participating in this struggle. Fighting alongside the workers are farm laborers and poor peasants, who in recent months have occupied tens of thousands of hectares (each hectare is equal to fifteen mu) of abandoned land. The decisive condition for the victory of this struggle is the increasing expansion and strengthening of working-class unity, and the unity of all working people on the basis of working-class unity.

This issue publishes an article by Kozłowska, a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, titled "The Experience of Party Education in the Polish United Workers' Party." The author pointed out: Last year's experience in party education showed that the work of study instructors and propagandists was based to a considerable extent on formalism and hasty preparation. Many training courses were detached from reality, lacked adequate combativeness, and did little to strengthen revolutionary vigilance. We are now organizing review classes to better prepare study instructors. They should organically combine the teaching of theory with the practice of daily life. The Party Central Committee, based on the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has also shifted the focus of party education work to the basic issues of the Party's policies.

This issue also publishes an article by Henry Rau, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, titled "Soviet Assistance to the German Democratic Republic." The article recounts the Soviet Union's assistance to the economic recovery and development of the German Democratic Republic in various aspects. The article pointed out: In August 1948 alone, the Soviet Union supplied the German people with 100,000 tons of wheat, 10,800 tons of animal fats and cooking oil. To facilitate the German people's economic and social construction, the Soviet Union specifically reduced the amount of reparations by half in May 1950.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二一期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一一期已经出版。
    本期以“社会主义和民主是不可战胜的”为题发表社论，纪念十二月五日——斯大林宪法日说：斯大林宪法具体表现了苏维埃社会主义民主主义的伟大性。苏联公民不论属于什么民族和种族，在经济生活、国家生活、文化生活或社会、政治生活方面，都享有平等的权利。社论接着说：任何一个资产阶级的宪法都没有而且也不可能有类似苏联宪法的伟大原则。列宁曾一再说过，资产阶级的民主只是最残酷的、最无耻的、准备毁灭千百万人民的帝国主义强盗的一个幌子而已。这种对资产阶级民主的描写的正确性，在今天的美国得到了最生动的证明。在那里，一小撮帝国主义统治者就是在“自由”和“民主”的幌子下横行不法。美英帝国主义者以及他们的走狗就用一些“自由”与“和平”的虚伪辞句作掩护，来从事恶毒的战争宣传，加紧扩军运动，对爱好和平的人民采取赤裸裸的侵略行动，以达到美帝国主义独霸世界的目的。社论最后说：社会主义意味着和平，意味着各国人民之间的友好。苏联所坚决执行的和平与国际安全的政策，受到世界各国人民的热烈拥护，他们日益深信：“社会主义和民主是不可战胜的。”（斯大林）
    本期发表了匈牙利劳动人民党政治局委员希基达斯的“在组织上经济上巩固匈牙利生产合作社的任务”一文。希基达斯说：今年匈牙利有些农业合作社的平均收获量超过了小农农场或过去地主庄园的最高收获量。有许多地方已经把合作社的初步分配计划公布出来。这些计划表明了在效率高的合作社内，每个社员的收入都超过了中农的平均收入，同时公积金的收入也随着增加了。希基达斯指出：虽然整个说来农业合作社的收成比个体农民好，但是它们还远没有发挥出一切的潜力。为了使我们农业的社会主义改造得到彻底的胜利，除了使最好的生产合作社变为真正的模范农场以外，还必须做到使所有的生产合作社都能很快地效法最好的生产合作社。其次，发展合作社的一个极重要的条件是要有较好的领导。党和政府正在采取一切措施来保证合作社主席和工作组组长很快地具备管理大农场所必需的专门知识。最后，机器拖拉机站和国营农场必须给予合作社以更多的帮助。
    本期刊载了意大利共产党中央委员蒙坦纳那的“意大利劳动人民为提高生活水平而斗争”一文，蒙坦纳那说：意大利劳动人民的实际工资在一九三八年的时候曾降到最低水平。现在，意大利工人和职员的平均实际工资据官方统计刚达到一九三八年的水平，失业人数却比一九三八年要多得多。根据官方统计，每人平均消费每天至少应该有三千卡路里（热量单位），而目前平均水平还没有超过二千三百六十七卡路里。资方付给工人的工资有时一天不到三百里拉（意币），虽然每个家庭每天至少需要二千一百里拉。这就是以工人阶级为首的劳动人民为什么热烈响应总工会的号召，坚决起来为反对扩张军备和争取提高生活水平而斗争的缘故。各种政治信仰的劳动人民，不论有组织的或没有组织的，在各处举行的群众大会上都表示了他们的斗争意志。劳动人民在进行斗争的时候，一方面要求增加工资，同时又需要从政府的关闭政策下挽救各个企业，防止大批解雇和制止民用生产转向战争的轨道。蒙坦纳那最后说：意大利劳动人民争取面包和适当的生活条件的斗争仍在继续进行。整个工业的各部门的工人都参加了这个斗争。和工人并肩斗争的有农场雇工和贫农，他们在最近几个月占有了几万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）荒废的土地。使这个斗争胜利的决定条件是工人阶级团结的日益扩展和壮大，以及全体劳动人民在工人阶级团结的基础上的团结。
    本期发表了波兰统一工人党中央委员科兹洛夫斯卡的“波兰统一工人党党教育的经验”一文。作者指出：去年党教育的经验显示：学习指导员和宣传员的工作在不小的程度上是基于形式主义和匆促的准备。许多训练班的情形是脱离现实的，缺乏适当的战斗性，对于加强革命警惕性也没有什么贡献。我们现在正在组织复习班，使学习指导员得到更好的准备。他们应当把理论的教授与日常生活的实践有机地结合起来。党中央委员会并根据苏联共产党的经验，把党教育工作的重心转移到党的政策的基本问题上。
    本期还刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员亨利·劳的“苏联对德意志民主共和国的援助”一文。文中历述了苏联在各方面帮助德意志民主共和国经济复兴和发展的情形。文中指出：苏联仅在一九四八年八月就供给了德国人民十万吨小麦、一万零八百吨动物脂肪和食油。为了便利德国人民的经济和社会建设，苏联在一九五○年五月特地把赔偿的数目减少了一半。    （新华社）
