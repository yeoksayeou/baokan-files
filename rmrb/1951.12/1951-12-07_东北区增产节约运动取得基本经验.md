Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 5th: The state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region have accumulated rich and basic experience in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. This basic experience is extremely valuable for the development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in other parts of the country.

    First, to carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, all cadres and workers must understand the guidelines of this movement. As early as May of this year, at the Urban Work Conference convened by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, clearly stated: It is necessary to rely on the working class, tap industrial potential, and complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy with a value equivalent to five million tons of grain, so as to further improve the country's industrial construction. He also specifically pointed out: We must start simultaneously from three aspects: accelerating capital turnover, improving product quality, and improving equipment utilization, increasing output and reducing costs. In the process of the campaign, some leading cadres of enterprises failed to correctly grasp this guideline, and some wrong understandings and practices occurred. For example, some leading cadres did not realize the political and economic significance of carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, and only regarded it as a financial task to be completed. Therefore, the phenomenon of apportioning the task of increasing production and practicing economy to various units within the enterprise, or only distributing the task to certain workshops that can create wealth, while ignoring the improvement of the entire enterprise's operation and management work. Some enterprises only focused on dealing with a large number of stagnant materials and accumulating wealth from accelerating capital turnover, and the plans for increasing output and reducing costs were set very low. Some believed that product quality inspection and other work were being carried out in the enterprise, and the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign could not be carried out at the same time, so they relaxed their leadership over this campaign. Some were only passively saving certain aspects of expenditure, ignoring the important issues in tapping the potential of industrial capacity. Some cadres even had a sense of complacency, thinking that the production level of their unit had exceeded the period of Japanese and puppet rule, and there was no more potential to be tapped. Workers also had various misunderstandings about the major task of increasing production and practicing economy with a value equivalent to five million tons of grain. These incorrect views and practices once hindered the development of the campaign in its initial stage. Therefore, explaining the guidelines of this campaign to the workers through various meetings and studying relevant documents on increasing production and practicing economy, raising the political awareness of the workers, eliminating various ideological concerns, and correcting various incorrect understandings and practices are prerequisites for the smooth development of this campaign. For example, some factories and mines have adopted the method of "calculating big accounts," linking them with the production situation of their units, explaining the importance of increasing production and practicing economy with a value equivalent to five million tons of grain for consolidating national defense and strengthening socialist state-owned enterprises, and combined with educating all workers on patriotism and the future of national construction, greatly improving the awareness of workers and laying the ideological foundation for carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign.

    Secondly, after the guidelines of increasing production and practicing economy are understood by all workers, the steps of the campaign should be shifted to exploring the potential of the enterprise. On this issue, some cadres also had deviations in their understanding: for example, some cadres simply relied on the calculations of financial and cost personnel to solve the problem of exploring potential. Some only asked technical personnel to find solutions from books, and some only relied on the "hard work" of a few leaders, without mobilizing all workers to come up with ideas and methods. Therefore, the planned production increases and economies were inevitably empty and the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers could not be fully exploited. This is an important reason why some factories and mines carried out ideological mobilization work in the early stage of the campaign, but the campaign still could not be carried out. Experience has proved that as long as we rely on the broad masses of workers, deeply understand and analyze the situation of the factory and mine itself, study the key issues in the current production of each unit, we can tap the potential of the enterprise. Many advanced factories and mines have mobilized workers to adopt the method of "calculating detailed accounts" in this campaign, studied the production situation of their units and the key issues of increasing production and practicing economy, and calculated the amount of wealth that could be increased after solving these problems, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the workers. Therefore, it is possible to improve the utilization rate of existing equipment, improve quality and reduce defective products, accelerate capital turnover, overcome waste, and promote advanced experience to tap the potential of enterprises, and overfulfill the original production plan and the task of increasing production and practicing economy every month.

    Thirdly, after tapping the potential, it is necessary to mobilize the workers to formulate specific implementation plans for the entire factory, workshop, and even class and group, and link this plan with patriotic covenants. In this way, the realization of the plan to increase production and practice economy is specifically guaranteed.

    Fourthly, after the plan to increase production and practice economy is formulated, there must be methods to complete the plan. These methods can be summarized as: finding "tricks," signing contracts, and organizing competitions. In this campaign, due to the increased production enthusiasm of the workers, many factories and mines, with the improvement of technical management as the center, formed a broad, mass movement, giving full play to the work initiative and creativity of the workers. Many factories circulated the vivid slogan "Tricks are smiling at you, see if you can find them," and workers were using their brains and thinking of ways to find various "tricks," transform tools, improve operating methods, and realize their plans for increasing production and practicing economy, whether at work or after work. Therefore, the number of rationalization proposals and inventions that emerged in the movement was unprecedented in the past. In addition, many factories and mines have further promoted the improvement of production management work by signing contact contracts and collective contracts, and carrying out labor competitions. In terms of competition methods, a factory in Shenyang created the competition method of "red flag inspection and blue flag supervision." Every day, after democratic evaluation, red flags were inserted into the groups, sections, or workshops that completed the production tasks, and blue flags were inserted into those that did not complete the tasks. This mass inspection and supervision also enhanced the unity of the workers and promoted the spirit of collectivism. Many examples of workers helping each other to complete production tasks appeared in various factories and mines.

    At present, the morale of the workers in various factories and mines is unprecedentedly full, and they are vying to learn from the experience of advanced factories and mines, striving to overfulfill the plan to increase production and practice economy in their units. Judging from the existing achievements, the achievements of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast this year will greatly exceed the original plan of increasing production and practicing economy with a value equivalent to ten million tons of grain. This will drive the industrial construction in the Northeast to a new climax under the impetus of the vigorously developing Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign.

### 东北区增产节约运动取得基本经验

    东北区增产节约运动取得基本经验
     【新华社沈阳五日电】东北区公营厂矿在增产节约运动中已积累了丰富的基本经验，这些基本经验对于关内各地展开增产节约运动是极其宝贵的。
    首先，开展增产节约运动，必须使全体干部和职工了解这一运动的方针。早在今年五月间，中共中央东北局所召开的城市工作会议上，东北局书记高岗就明确地提出：要依靠工人阶级，发挥工业潜力，完成增产节约价值五百万吨粮食的任务，把国家的工业建设更加提高一步。他并具体地指出：要从加速资金周转、改善产品质量和提高设备利用率、增加产量和降低成本等三个方面同时着手进行。在运动开展过程中，某些企业领导干部未能正确地掌握这一方针，曾经产生了一些错误的认识与做法。如有的领导干部没有认识开展增产节约运动的政治意义和经济意义，只是当作一项财政任务来完成，因此，曾经发生在本企业内向各单位平均分摊增产节约任务的现象，或是把任务只分给某些能够创造财富的车间，而忽视了改进整个企业的经营管理工作；有的企业只着眼于处理大量的呆滞材料，从加速资金周转中来积累财富，对于增加产量、降低成本的计划却订得很低；有的认为企业中正在进行着产品质量检查等工作，不能同时开展增产节约运动，因而放松了对于这一运动的领导；有的只是消极地节省某些方面的开支，忽视了发挥工业潜在能力中的重要问题；有的干部甚至存在着自满情绪，认为我这单位的生产水平已经超过日伪统治时期，再也没有潜在能力可以发挥等等。职工群众也有对于增产节约价值等于五百万吨粮食的重大任务存在着种种误解。这些不正确的看法和做法，在运动的初期，都曾经阻碍着运动的开展。因此，通过各种会议，以及学习有关增产节约的文件，在职工群众中说明这一运动的方针，提高职工的政治认识，消除各种思想顾虑，纠正各种不正确的认识和做法，是使得这一运动顺利开展的先决条件。如有些厂、矿曾经采用“算大账”的方法，联系本单位的生产状况，说明增产节约价值等于五百万吨粮食对于巩固国防、壮大社会主义性质的国营企业的重要性，并结合着向全体工人进行关于爱国主义和国家建设前途的教育，大大地提高了职工的觉悟，为开展增产节约运动奠定思想基础。
    其次，当增产节约的方针为全体职工所认识以后，运动的步骤就应转入发掘企业的潜在能力。在这一问题上，也曾有某些干部在认识上发生偏差：如有的干部单纯依靠财务人员和成本人员的计算，来解决发掘潜在能力的问题。有的只是叫技术人员从书本上去找办法，有的只凭少数领导人员的“苦心”思索，而没有发动全体职工出主意、想办法。因此，订出来的增产节约计划就不免流于空洞，广大职工的积极性和创造性也不能充分发挥。这是有些厂、矿在运动初期虽然进行了思想动员工作，而运动仍然不能开展的重要原因。经验证明：只要依靠全体职工群众，深入地了解和分析厂、矿本身各方面的情况，研究每一单位当前生产中的关键问题，才能发掘企业的潜在能力。许多先进厂、矿在这次运动中，都曾经动员职工采取“算细账”的方式，研究了本单位的生产状况和增产节约的关键问题，并计算了解决这些问题以后可能增加财富的数目，大大鼓舞了职工们的热情；因而能够从提高现有设备利用率、提高质量减少废品、加速资金周转、克服浪费现象、推广先进经验等方面，发挥了企业的潜力，月月都超额完成了原订生产计划和增产节约的任务。
    再次，经过发掘潜力之后，必须发动职工群众，订出全厂、车间以至班、组的具体实施计划，并把这一计划和爱国公约联系起来。这样，增产节约计划的实现，就有了具体的保证。
    再次，增产节约计划订出后，必须有完成计划的方法。这些方法，归纳起来就是：找“窍门”、订合同、组织竞赛。在这次运动中，由于广大职工生产积极性的提高，许多厂、矿以改进技术管理为中心，形成了一个广泛的、群众性的运动，充分发挥了广大职工的工作主动性和创造性。许多工厂中都流传着“窍门向你笑，看你找不找”的生动口号，工人们不论在上班时或下班后，都在用脑子、想办法，找出各种“窍门”，改造工具，改善操作方法，实现自己的增产节约计划。因此，运动中出现的合理化建议和创造发明之多，为过去各个时期所罕见。此外，许多厂、矿又通过订立联系合同和集体合同以及开展劳动竞赛等方法，更进一步促进了生产管理工作的改善。在竞赛方法上，沈阳某工厂创造了“红旗检查、蓝旗督促”的竞赛方法，每天经过民主评定，给完成生产任务的小组、工段或车间插上红旗，没有完成任务的就插上蓝旗。这种群众性的检查、督促，也增进了职工们的团结，发扬了集体主义的精神，各厂、矿中出现了许多职工互相协助完成生产任务的范例。
    目前，各厂、矿职工的情绪空前饱满，争相学习各先进厂、矿的经验，为争取超额完成本单位的增产节约计划而奋斗。从目前已有的成绩来看，今年东北公营各厂、矿的增产节约成绩，将大大超过原订增产节约价值一千万吨粮食的计划。这将使东北的工业建设在蓬勃开展的增产节约运动的推动下，走向一个新的高潮。
