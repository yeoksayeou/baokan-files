    Broad Masses of Peasants in Cang County, Hebei Province,
    Enthusiastically Pay Patriotic Public Grain and Transport it to the Granary On Time and According to Quota
    Comrade Editor: Under the influence of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the level of awareness among the broad masses of peasants in Cang County, Hebei Province, has generally increased. During the autumn grain collection, grain payment was extremely enthusiastic. Six villages, including Chongxian and Xinji in Qing County under the jurisdiction of this special district, had lagged behind in paying public grain in previous years, but this year they voluntarily paid off nearly one million jin of public grain in advance and sent it to the granary. In Xian County's North Street, when the collection started on November 8, many people delivering grain were waiting to be weighed before dawn. Many villages beat gongs and drums when delivering grain, and the mood was extremely enthusiastic.
    In order to do a good job in storing autumn grain, all counties in the special district emphasized the need to organize transportation to the granary when arranging autumn grain collection, and they also inspected this work in advance. Generally, villages contact the granary in advance to determine the amount of grain to be delivered, and the warehouse issues a "Delivery Certificate," so that it can be delivered to the granary on time and according to quota. Xin Kailu and other villages in Cang County have done a good job in organizing, so that autumn collection and autumn plowing are not delayed. The masses delivering grain have reflected: "The government is thoughtful and has truly achieved orderly entry into the granary." Wang Xiting, Li Laixuan

    河北沧县专区广大农民
    踊跃缴纳爱国公粮按时按量运送入库
    编辑同志：河北沧县专区广大农民在抗美援朝运动影响下，觉悟程度普遍提高，在秋征当中，缴粮极为踊跃。这个专署所辖青县崇仙、辛集等六个村，历年缴公粮都落在后面，但今年却自动地把近百万斤公粮提前缴清，送到粮库；献县北街在十一月八日开征，天不亮就有不少送粮群众等着过秤。很多村庄在送粮时都敲锣打鼓，情绪极为热烈。
    为了做好秋粮入库工作，专区各县在布置秋征工作时都强调了要有组织地运送入库，并且事前对这一工作都作了检查。一般的村庄都是事前和粮库接洽好送粮数字，由仓库开给“送达证”，因此能够做到按时按量运送入库。沧县新开路等村，由于组织工作做得好，做到秋征、秋耕两不误。送粮群众纷纷反映：“政府想得周到，真是做到了有秩序地入库。”　王喜亭　李来轩
