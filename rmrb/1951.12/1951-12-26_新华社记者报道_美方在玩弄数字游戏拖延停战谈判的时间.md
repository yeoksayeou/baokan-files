Xinhua News Agency reporter reports:

    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 25th] Our special correspondent reports: On the eve of Christmas, millions of prisoners of war and their families in the Korean War were expecting a swift decision in the Panmunjom conference tent to release all prisoners of war. However, the actions of the U.S. representatives showed their indifference to the interests of the prisoners of war. They wasted another precious day at the negotiating table playing number games.
    At the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee meeting on the 24th, U.S. representative Libby claimed that the number of prisoners handed over by the Korean and Chinese side was "tens of thousands fewer" than the number published in the communiques. General Lee Sang-cho told Libby with irrefutable facts that one of the important aspects of the consistent prisoner policy of the Korean and Chinese side was to release prisoners and allow them to return to their families from the front lines. The whole world knows that the Korean and Chinese side has released a large number of prisoners of war in the past and still advocates discussing the principle of releasing all prisoners of war immediately. This truly humane behavior and stance of the Korean and Chinese side is incomprehensible to the U.S. representatives. The U.S. is trying every possible means to avoid discussing this principle. They have made no secret of saying that the so-called release of prisoners would give one side a military advantage. Therefore, Libby indicated that they would still detain more than 16,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and could not provide a satisfactory answer or explanation for the whereabouts of more than 44,000 prisoners of war raised by the Korean and Chinese side. Despite Libby's playing number games, his excuses for avoiding discussion of the principle of releasing prisoners of war were broken one by one. In their letter to Ridgway on the 24th, Generals Kim and Peng suggested that representatives of the Red Cross Societies of Korea and China, together with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, form a joint visiting group to visit prisoner-of-war camps on both sides after the armistice agreement is signed and takes effect, and be prepared to assist in the repatriation of prisoners at the concentration points for prisoner exchange on both sides. Prior to this, the Korean and Chinese side had stated that it agreed to release and repatriate all prisoners of war held by both sides in batches within the shortest possible period after the signing of the armistice agreement, and that seriously wounded and sick prisoners of war should be released in the first batch. General Lee Sang-cho questioned Libby at the meeting: Now that only three days are left of the thirty-day deadline, are you trying to delay the negotiations with this issue of immediate exchange of seriously wounded and sick prisoners? Libby had no answer. Although he did not say it, he had previously said that "no one can predict whether there will be an armistice and when." The U.S. representatives, who claim to be "humane" and "civilized," are obviously using prisoners as bargaining chips for their own purposes, just like slave owners in slave society.
    On the 24th, the Korean and Chinese side made another effort at the Third Agenda Subcommittee meeting. General Xie Fang made several amendments to the six proposals of the Korean and Chinese side. These new suggestions are: After the signing of the armistice agreement, neither side shall bring combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, or ammunition into Korea from outside Korea. The Korean and Chinese side also suggested that the locations inspected by the neutral nations supervisory organizations include locations where violations of the armistice agreement are reported, and agreed to stipulate that the neutral nations supervisory organizations must conduct inspections upon request by either or both sides of the belligerent countries. Regardless of the efforts of the Korean and Chinese side, the U.S. side did not abandon its intolerable demand to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea on the 24th. General Xie Fang reiterated solemnly that as long as the U.S. side abandons its unreasonable demand to interfere in our internal affairs, the meeting will make progress immediately. Whether the Korean negotiations can reach an agreement quickly or continue to be delayed will depend on whether the U.S. side is willing to abandon its absurd demands.

### 新华社记者报道  美方在玩弄数字游戏拖延停战谈判的时间

    美方在玩弄数字游戏拖延停战谈判的时间
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜战争中千万个战俘及其亲属们在圣诞节前夕，正期待着板门店会议帐篷内迅速作出释放全体战俘的决定，但是美方代表的行动显示出他们对战俘们的利益漠不关心。他们在会议桌上玩弄数字游戏，又消磨了一天宝贵的时间。
    在二十四日的第四项议程小组委员会上，美方代表利比提出朝中方面交给他们的俘虏数字要比战绩公报发表的数字“少几万人”。李相朝将军以无可置疑的事实告诉利比，朝中方面一贯的俘虏政策的重要内容之一是释放俘虏，而且在前线释放战俘，让他们回到自己的家庭。全世界都知道朝中方面过去已释放了大批的战俘，并且现在仍然主张立即讨论释放全体战俘的原则。朝中方面这种释放战俘的真正人道的行为和立场，是美方代表所不能理解的。美方正在千方百计地逃避讨论这个原则。他们曾毫不隐讳地表示所谓释放俘虏将给予一方以军事利益。因此，利比表示还要扣留朝、中籍的一万六千多名战俘，而且对朝中方面所提出的四万四千多个俘虏的下落，还不能提出圆满的答复和解释。尽管利比在玩弄数字游戏，但是他逃避讨论释放战俘原则问题的藉口，是一个个地被打破了。金、彭两将军在二十四日复李奇微的信中，已建议由朝鲜和中国的红十字会的代表，会同红十字国际委员会的代表组成联合访问团，在停战协定签字生效之后，到双方战俘营去进行访问，并准备在双方战俘交换的集中地点协助遣送俘虏的工作。在此以前，朝中方面已声明，同意在停战协议签字后最短可能的期间内，双方分批释放及遣送完毕其收容的全部战俘，并确定重伤、重病战俘应先在第一批内释放。李相朝将军在会上质问利比：现在离三十天的期限只剩下三天了，你们是不是想用这个立即交换重伤、重病俘虏的问题来拖延谈判？利比无话可答。他虽然没有说出来，但是以前他曾说过“谁也不能预计有没有停战和何时停战”。自称“人道”和“文明”的美方代表，显然正像奴隶社会的奴隶主一样，为着他们自己的目的，用俘虏作讨价还价的买卖。
    二十四日，朝中方面在第三项议程小组委员会上，又作了一次努力。解方将军对朝中方面的六条方案提出了几点修正。这些新的建议是：停战协议签字后，双方不得从朝鲜境外进入作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。朝中方面并建议中立国监察机构视察的地点，包括报告发生违反停战协议事件的地点，并同意规定中立国监察机构在交战国双方或一方提出视察的请求时，即须进行视察。不管朝中方面的努力，美方在二十四日仍然没有放弃干涉朝鲜内政的不可容忍的要求。解方将军再度郑重表示，只要美方放弃干涉我方内政的无理要求，会议就立刻会有进展。朝鲜谈判能否迅速达成协议还是继续拖延，将视美方是否愿意放弃它的荒谬要求而定。
