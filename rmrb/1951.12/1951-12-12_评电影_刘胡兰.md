    Review of the Movie "Liu Hulan"
    Xiao Yin
    Liu Hulan is one of the good sons and daughters of the Chinese people educated and nurtured by the Chinese Communist Party. Her noble revolutionary character, her noble spirit of sacrificing herself for the revolution, and her heroic and unyielding heroic deeds have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people and are familiar and loved by the masses through legends, reports, comic strips, and the opera "Liu Hulan." Therefore, it is not surprising that people have high hopes for the screening of the movie "Liu Hulan." People hope that the movie will be better than the opera "Liu Hulan," and that it can use the special properties of film art to more realistically and convincingly portray the hero's history, her character, and the development of her character, just as Soviet films created young heroes such as Zoya and Oleg.
    However, the film "Liu Hulan" fails to meet the audience's expectations. The image of Liu Hulan on the screen is still far from the heroic and fearless image of this young female hero in the minds of the masses. The directors did not create a good image of this young female Communist Party member who was loved by thousands of people and who "lived greatly and died gloriously." Not only that, the heroic character of Liu Hulan and its development process, as depicted in the film, are seriously distorted, and Liu Hulan's family and revolutionary experiences are also very different from reality.
    I have read "A Brief Biography of Liu Hulan" written by Liang Xing (published by China Youth Publishing House), which the author "recorded based on the talks of Liu Hulan's comrades, villagers, and family members," and which "maintains the original appearance of the characters and facts." Although this biography may still omit some valuable materials, it should be said that it records the main aspects of Liu Hulan's character and facts. It records her ordinary but revolutionary words and deeds that show her greatness; it records the environment and conditions that shaped this character, and specifically writes about how Liu Hulan embarked on the road of revolution under the influence and education of the Party.
    As long as we compare Liu Hulan's history before joining the Party, we can see how different the Liu Hulan in real life is from the Liu Hulan in the film. The author of "A Brief Biography of Liu Hulan" tells us that before joining the Party, Liu Hulan underwent the Party's class education, was deeply influenced by the revolutionary struggle, and was tested and tempered in practical work. However, in the movie, Liu Hulan has a different experience. We do not ask the film directors to move all the facts that Liu Hulan experienced to the screen without any changes, but we cannot allow them to completely deviate from the main plot of Liu Hulan's life and fabricate them out of thin air. Since the object of the film is Liu Hulan, and Liu Hulan's original character and deeds have a typical nature, and her revolutionary qualities and her heroic deeds of dedicating herself to the people's revolutionary cause itself contain profound educational significance, then why don't the directors describe Liu Hulan's original appearance—the original environment, age, experience, as well as her character characteristics and deeds? If artists feel insufficient to mechanically reflect existing phenomena and facts, and require appropriate artistic processing, that is completely right and reasonable. But it must be based on the main aspects of the character's original character and deeds, to deepen and generalize them, so that they are more vivid, more prominent, more concentrated, and more organized. It should never be replaced by another completely different life and struggle. As far as I know, the struggle life of Liu Hulan in the movie and the struggle life of the real Liu Hulan are not consistent with the original facts except for the same heroic sacrifice. Some people once said: "Why must we describe it according to Liu Hulan's life? Can't this also educate the people?" But I want to ask, since we are setting aside Liu Hulan's original life, why not write another name? Why do we have to write Liu Hulan's name? And why is Chairman Mao's eulogy to Liu Hulan also written on the screen?
    In fact, the main problem is not here. The reason why the movie "Liu Hulan" has serious shortcomings is not only because it distorts Liu Hulan's original appearance, but more importantly, because it distorts the truth of life and castrates the logic of life.
    In the era of fierce class struggle, it is difficult to imagine that literary writers (including film script writers) can observe or deal with the growth of heroic character if they leave the Party's political and class education, leave the influence of the revolutionary movement, and leave the tempering of actual struggle. "A Brief Biography of Liu Hulan" narrates more truthfully the changes in Liu Hulan's heart caused by the Party's education, the revolutionary movement, and actual training. However, in the film, the Party's political and class education for Liu Hulan is extremely weak, or even invisible. On the screen, we only see a few shots: when Liu Hulan was only four or five years old, Red Army instructor Comrade Sun said to everyone (including Liu Hulan): "...Many people in our team are also from farming backgrounds. Don't be afraid. We are dedicated to fighting landlords and rich people who exploit and oppress us poor people." In addition, Comrade Sun also taught Liu Hulan to write, and the branch secretary once told Liu Hulan to "work hard." After the enemy burned the village, the branch secretary saw that Liu Hulan was very depressed (this expression is not in line with the character of the young Communist Party member Liu Hulan), and taught her to "cheer up." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Xiaoqing said to Liu Hulan: "...In the future, you must lead everyone to do a good job in production." These are the only few shots related to education, and they all lack the content of class education. As for the influence of the revolutionary movement on Liu Hulan's thinking, it is rarely mentioned in the film.
    Secondly, the relationship between Liu Hulan and the masses is also handled very weakly and inappropriately in the film. Liu Hulan is the women's leader in the minds of the masses. According to "A Brief Biography of Liu Hulan," she participated in the anti-corruption struggle and the land reform; she served as the secretary of the village women's association, handled disputes among the masses, and also went to nearby villages with Lu Xuemei to carry out women's work; she mobilized and organized women to make military shoes, raised comfort items, and educated backward elements; when the situation was urgent, in order to win over the wavering element Jin Xian, she risked staying in the village to work; when the enemy had already surrounded the village, in order to avoid implicating the Duan Jinzhong family, she would rather go to the top herself... Such a bloody and fleshy struggle life and her flesh-and-blood relationship with the broad masses of people everywhere embody her noble revolutionary character and her concern for the interests of the broad masses of people. However, the directors of the film completely ignored these and instead created another set. The film depicts Liu Hulan teaching women to read, sewing military uniforms with many women, directing the masses to retreat, saving a child, and giving the child some millet. …The directors replaced facts with fantasies, and replaced serious investigation and research on Liu Hulan's historical life with weak and powerless concepts and imaginations. As a result, they blurred, and even distorted, this hero who grew up among the people and her flesh-and-blood connection with the people.
    Since the directors failed to appropriately write out the role of the Party's political and class education for her, and also failed to appropriately write out her normal relationship with the masses, then the film cannot help but leave people with the impression that Liu Hulan's behavior of risking her life to rescue the branch secretary, and her heroic and unyielding behavior after being captured, lack the power to convince people. Everyone understands that these heroic acts require a high degree of political and class consciousness to support them. However, the film does not clearly explain the improvement of Liu Hulan's political and class consciousness and the process of improvement. In this way, it makes people feel that Liu Hulan's image does not have a strong ideological foundation of class consciousness. Since this is the case, then many heroic behaviors and words of Liu Hulan on the screen cannot but be things without an ideological foundation and lacking persuasive power.
    The reason why the movie caused such a result is not that the directors intended to do so, nor is it theoretically believed that it should be so. I think the failure of the movie "Liu Hulan" is mainly because the film directors left life, left reality, and left the in-depth investigation and careful analysis of Liu Hulan's specific history. For such a heroic figure who "lived greatly and died gloriously," the directors only retained the scene of her heroic sacrifice in the handling, and only retained a little outline of her deeds. Her real life was abandoned, and this approach obviously cannot express her great heroic character and its growth process. No matter how much effort the directors put in when dealing with this subject matter, in essence, they still handled this subject matter from the general concept of heroes, and used the general concept of heroes to replace the mastery and understanding of Liu Hulan's specific history.
    Because of the lack of life and the lack of concrete understanding of life, the film directors had to use some thrilling scenes to decorate the poverty of life and fill the lack of life. Understanding this, we can understand why the directors wrote the young Liu Hulan to be brave enough to resist the landlord, why Liu Hulan was allowed to save children in the chaos, why they wrote Liu Hulan fainting, why they wrote Liu Hulan rescuing the branch secretary, why they wrote her shooting and fighting the enemy, and simply became a combatant... and other scenes. The directors may have thought that in this way, the heroic image of Liu Hulan can be vividly "shaped," but in fact, they first seemed to forget that Liu Hulan was just a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl. The noble revolutionary character of a young person like her cannot be exactly the same as that of an adult hero, but has its own different characteristics and different expressions. In life, Liu Hulan's noble and strong temperament is threaded through her ordinary and great, heroic and not violating her age characteristics of revolutionary activities, threaded through her simple and unadorned actions and words. However, the directors of the film did not grasp and understand these characteristics of her from Liu Hulan's specific history, but instead used the life of adult heroes to replace Liu Hulan's own life, and handed Liu Hulan weapons that Liu Hulan was not accustomed to using. …As a result, it will not only hinder the true expression of Liu Hulan's character, but also distort the truth of life. The failure of the movie "Liu Hulan" has powerfully proved that all practices that deviate from life and unilaterally emphasize "skills" cannot achieve artistic success.

    评电影“刘胡兰”
    萧　殷
    刘胡兰是中国共产党所教育和培养出来的中国人民的好儿女之一。她的高尚的革命品格、她的为革命献身的高贵气质以及她的英勇不屈的英雄事迹，通过传说、报道、连环画和歌剧“刘胡兰”，已经深入人心，为群众所熟悉和敬爱。因此，毫不足怪，人们怀着很大的希望来期待电影“刘胡兰”的放映。人们希望电影能比歌剧“刘胡兰”更好，希望借助于电影艺术的特殊性能，使它能够更真实地更有说服力地表现出英雄人物的历史、她的性格和性格的成长过程，就像苏联电影创造出索雅和奥列格等青年英雄形象一样。
    但是，影片“刘胡兰”不能满足观众的要求。银幕上的刘胡兰和群众心目中的这位青年女英雄的英勇无畏的形象距离还远。编导者确实没有创造好这个受到千千万万人民敬爱的“生的伟大，死的光荣”的青年女共产党员的形象。不仅如此，电影所描写的刘胡兰的英雄性格和它的成长过程，是被严重地歪曲了的，刘胡兰的家庭、革命经历也和实际出入很大。
    我曾读过梁星写的“刘胡兰小传”（青年出版社出版），这是作者“根据刘胡兰的同志、乡亲、家属的谈话记录下来的”，“保持着人物和事实的本来面目”的传记。这篇传记，虽然还可能遗漏一些有价值的材料，但对于刘胡兰的品质与事实的主要方面，应该说还是记录出来了的。它记载了她的平凡的、然而显示了她的伟大的革命品格的一些言行；它记载了形成这品格的环境和条件，并且具体地写出了刘胡兰怎样在党的影响和教育下走上了革命的道路。
    只要比较一下入党以前的刘胡兰的历史，就可以看出实际生活中的刘胡兰和电影形象中的刘胡兰是多么不同。“刘胡兰小传”的作者告诉我们：刘胡兰在入党以前，是经过党的阶级教育、受过革命斗争的深刻影响，并在实际工作中受过考验和锻炼的。然而在电影里，刘胡兰却有另外一种经历。我们并不要求电影编导者把刘胡兰所经历过的事实都丝毫不变地搬到银幕上，但是也不能容许完全离开刘胡兰的生活的主要情节而凭空杜撰。电影的描写对象既然是刘胡兰，而刘胡兰的本来性格和事迹既具有典型性质，她的革命品质和她为人民革命事业而献身的英雄事迹本身，既包含着深厚的教育意义，那么编导者为什么不根据刘胡兰的本来面目——本来的环境、年龄、经历以及她的性格特性和事迹加以描写呢？如果说，艺术家对于机械地反映实有的现象和事实，感到不足，而要求有适当的艺术加工，那是完全应该的，而且是合理的。但是必须根据人物原有的性格与事迹的主要方面，加以深化和概括，使之更鲜明、更突出、更集中、更有组织性。绝不应该以另外一套完全不同的生活和斗争来代替刘胡兰的生活和斗争。据我所知，电影中刘胡兰的斗争生活和真实的刘胡兰的斗争生活，除了英勇就义一点相同之外，其它重要情节都和原有的事实不相符合的。曾经有人说过：“何必一定要根据刘胡兰的生活来描写呢？这样写不是也能教育人民吗？”但是我要问，既然撇开刘胡兰的本来生活，那为什么不写另外一个名字？而独独要写刘胡兰的名字呢？又为什么把毛主席对刘胡兰的悼词也写在银幕上呢？
    其实，主要的问题，还不在这里，电影“刘胡兰”所以存在着严重的缺点，不仅仅因为它歪曲了刘胡兰的本来面貌，更重要的，是因为它歪曲了生活的真实，阉割了生活的逻辑。
    在阶级斗争激烈的年代里，如果文学作家（电影剧本作家也在内）离开了党的政治教育和阶级教育、离开了革命运动的影响、离开实际斗争的锻炼来观察或处理英雄性格的成长，是很难想像的。“刘胡兰小传”是较真实地叙述了党的教育、革命运动以及实际锻炼对于刘胡兰内心所促成的变化过程的。但在影片中，党对于刘胡兰的政治教育和阶级教育，却是极端薄弱的，甚至是看不见的。在银幕上，我们只看见这么几个镜头：当刘胡兰才四五岁的时候，红军指导员孙同志曾向大家（刘胡兰也在内）说过：“……我们队伍里，也有许多人是种庄稼出身的，你们不要怕，我们是专打剥削咱们穷人、压迫咱们穷人的地主老财。”此外，孙同志还教过刘胡兰写字，支部书记曾告诉过刘胡兰要“好好工作”。当敌人烧了村子之后，支部书记见刘胡兰很颓丧（这种表情是不合乎青年共产党员刘胡兰的性格的），曾教导她“拿起精神来”。抗日胜利后，小青向刘胡兰说过：“……以后，你更要带领大家好好生产。”这是仅有的几个有关教育的镜头，而且都缺少阶级教育的内容。至于革命运动对于刘胡兰思想的影响，在影片中几乎很少提到。
    其次，刘胡兰和群众的关系，在影片中也被处理得很无力和很不恰当。刘胡兰是群众心目中的妇女领袖，据“刘胡兰小传”记述，她曾参加过反贪污斗争，参加过土地改革；担任过村妇女会秘书，处理过群众的纠纷，还和吕雪梅到附近各村开展过妇女工作；她动员、组织妇女群众做军鞋，募集慰劳品，教育过落后分子；当情况紧急时，为争取动摇分子金仙，她冒着危险留在村里工作；当敌人已经包围了村庄，她为了怕连累了段金忠一家，宁愿自己去顶……这样有血有肉的斗争生活以及她和广大群众血肉相连的关系，处处都体现着她的高尚的革命品格，体现着她对于广大人民利益的关心。但电影的编导者完全无视这些，反而另外去杜撰一套。影片描写刘胡兰教妇女群众认字，和许多妇女一起缝军衣；指挥群众撤退；救过一个小孩子，并且给过小孩子一些小米。……编导者以空想去代替事实，用薄弱无力的概念和想像去代替对于刘胡兰的历史生活的认真的调查和研究，正是这样，结果把这个在人民中成长起来的英雄以及她和人民的血肉相连的关系，模糊了，甚至歪曲了。
    既然编导者未能恰当地写出党对她的政治教育和阶级教育的作用，又未能恰当地写出她和群众的正常关系，那末，影片就不能不给人留下这样的印象，即：刘胡兰冒着生命危险去抢救支部书记的行为，以及她被俘之后的英勇不屈的行为，都缺乏使人信服的力量。谁都明白，这些英雄的行径，是需要高度的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟来支持的。但影片对于刘胡兰的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟的提高及其提高的过程，却没有明确的交代，这样，就使人觉得刘胡兰这形象，并没有强固的阶级觉悟的思想基础。既然这样，那末在银幕上刘胡兰的许多英雄行为和言谈，就不能不是无思想基础的、缺乏说服力量的东西。
    电影所以造成这样的结果，并不是编导者有意这样，也不是在理论上认为应该如此。我以为影片“刘胡兰”的失败，主要原因是电影编导者离开了生活、离开了实际、离开了对刘胡兰的具体历史的深入调查和认真分析。对于这样一个“生的伟大，死的光荣”的英雄人物，编导者在处理上仅仅保留了她的英勇就义的一幕，仅仅保留了她的事迹的一点点轮廓，她的真实的生活被弃置不顾，这样做法显然是无法表现出她的伟大的英雄品格以及它的成长过程的。不管编导者在处理这个题材时下过多少工夫，但实质上，仍然是从一般英雄概念出发去处理这个题材，是用一般的英雄概念去代替对刘胡兰具体历史的掌握和理解的。
    正因为缺乏生活和没有具体地理解生活，电影编导者就不能不用一些惊险的场面来粉饰生活的贫乏和填补生活的不足。明了了这一点，我们就能够理解编导者为什么把幼小的刘胡兰写得勇于反抗地主，为什么让刘胡兰在混乱中去救小孩，为什么要写刘胡兰昏倒，为什么要写刘胡兰抢救支部书记，为什么要写她打枪和敌人作战，简直变成了一个战斗员……等等场面的用意了。编导者也许以为这样一来，就可以把刘胡兰这英雄形象生动地“塑造”出来，其实，他们首先就好像忘记刘胡兰只是一个十四五岁的小姑娘，像她这样年轻的人，她的高尚的革命品格不能和成年的英雄完全一样，而是有其不同的特征和不同的表现方式的。生活中刘胡兰的高尚的坚强的气质，是贯串在她的平凡的而又伟大的、英勇的而又不违背她的年龄特征的革命活动之中，贯串在她的单纯朴素的行动和言谈之中的。然而影片编导者没有从刘胡兰的具体历史中去把握和理解她的这些特点，反而用成年英雄的生活去代替刘胡兰自己的生活，拿刘胡兰所不惯使用的武器，硬交给刘胡兰去使用。……其结果，不仅会妨害刘胡兰性格的真实的表现，而且也会歪曲生活的真实。电影“刘胡兰”的失败，已有力地证明：一切脱离生活、片面强调“技巧”的作法，都无法达到艺术上成功的目的。
