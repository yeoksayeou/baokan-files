Comrades:
    We are responding to Chairman Mao's call to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy. This is the positive side. On the negative side, we must thoroughly fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
    In 1949, during the discussion of the Common Program draft at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, there were phrases such as "severely punish corruption, prohibit waste" in the draft. At that time, everyone agreed to pass it, but I did not fully recognize the importance of these words. After two years, corruption and waste have indeed occurred, and continue to occur.
    Article 18 of the Common Program: "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must practice a revolutionary work style of integrity, simplicity, and service to the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from the masses of the people." This article is aimed at corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
    Today my report is divided into four sections:
    First Section: The Moral Standard of New Democracy
    What is moral and immoral? What standard should we use to measure whether something is moral or immoral?
    Society is evolving, and the standard of morality is also evolving. In the past society, the words "loyalty" and "filial piety" were considered the main morals of a person, and for women, the word "chastity" was added. These are all products of the feudal era.
    New democratic society has new moral standards. The new moral standard is the moral standard of new democracy, the moral standard of people's democracy, that is, everything is for the people. The world is the world of the people, and the country is the country of the people. We should dedicate everything to the people, including our own lives. This is the most basic, but also the simplest truth. The new moral standard is that your behavior is beneficial to the broad masses of the people, then it is moral; if it is harmful to the broad masses of the people, then it is immoral.
    Is filial piety to parents right? In a new democratic society, it is not said that filial piety to parents is wrong, but that we should serve the people more broadly and more. If you are detached from the broad masses of the people for the sake of filial piety to your parents, then it is wrong. Is it right to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea? Is it right to serve your parents at home? Under the new moral standard, the former should be chosen. If you participate in revolutionary work on the one hand, and try your best to be filial to your parents spiritually and materially on the other hand, this is completely right. Serving the people does not mean ignoring one's parents. "Children have the obligation to support and assist their parents," as stipulated in Article 13 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China.
    The new moral standard is: beneficial to the broad masses of the people is moral, and harmful to the broad masses of the people is immoral. If we accept this standard, then, supposing someone obtains materials or property belonging to the people by improper means, or consumes them unnecessarily, is this good? Is it in line with morality? Of course not. The so-called obtaining the people's property by improper means is corruption, and the so-called consuming the people's property unnecessarily is waste.
    Article 42 of the Common Program: "Advocating love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and love for public property as the public morality of all citizens of the People's Republic of China." How to cherish public property? That is, we should save and protect the use of public materials and property. Then, it is even more unacceptable to turn public property into private property.
    Waste is already wrong, and corruption is of course even more unacceptable. Our fight against corruption and waste is entirely in line with the principles of the Common Program.

    Second Section: The Source of Corruption and Waste
    Corruption and waste are criminal and erroneous behaviors. This is a very simple principle that everyone understands. Why are there still phenomena of corruption and waste in our new society?
    Our new society has three major enemies: feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Although these three enemies have been defeated domestically, they have not been defeated in the minds of some people. The toxins left behind by these enemies are still acting up anytime and anywhere. In feudal society, the majority of people were oppressed and exploited by a minority. Everyone tried their best to put things in their own pockets, regardless of whether the source was proper or not. It was natural to take as much as possible. Under feudal rule, theft was also subject to punishment by the special laws of the ruling class, the so-called "undue enrichment." Even if the oppressed and exploited people stole some things from others due to the pressure of life, they would be punished. But the ruling class's own large-scale theft was not a crime. During the Anti-Japanese War, when I was a National Senator in Chongqing, I filed many impeachment cases of corruption, but once they involved wealthy families, they "sank into the sea" without any impact.
    Corruption has a history of thousands of years in China. Our new China has only been established for two years, and it is difficult to completely get rid of the influence of the poison left over from the old society. We must be vigilant. Premier Zhou told us: When the Chinese Communist Party held the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in February 1949, the revolutionary situation had already developed. Chairman Mao warned the Party: "Comrades, we are now going to cooperate with many people who came from the old society. We must be careful and prevent the bad habits of the old society from drilling into the Chinese Communist Party." Now that I think about it, Chairman Mao was truly farsighted.
    Corruption and waste also exist among individual Communist Party members. The vast majority are still people from the old society. The occurrence of corruption and waste is mainly due to two reasons: First, ideological problems. Society has changed, but people's understanding has not all changed. Some people have not transformed their thinking at all, and have not clearly understood the moral standards of new democracy. Second, the temptation of material life, the demand for everything to be good to eat and use, and even better. How to do it when there is not enough money in their own pockets and income does not cover expenses? At first, they borrowed, but always borrowing was not a solution. When an opportunity came, they used public office for private gain, fabricated a false account when they went on a business trip to purchase materials. Once successful, they became more and more greedy. Corruption is gradually cultivated and developed. It can be said that no one is determined to be corrupt from the beginning.
    Corruption and waste are not trivial matters. According to the figures I know, in the past two years, the loss of state property caused by corruption and waste has been very large, shockingly large.
    Some people also say: "Corruption may be due to poverty. It would be better to increase the salary." This view is not entirely correct. According to the materials from Beijing, out of the 153 corruption cases that have been discovered, only one was because of poverty, and the rest of the corrupt officials were not poor. Even if they are really poor, they should think of other ways, corruption is always wrong.
    Corruption is unacceptable, is waste forgivable? Comrades! Corruption and waste are of course different, but both are equally unforgivable.
    We are using the money of the people. The Central Light Industry Department has always paid attention to economy. People say we are "stingy," but when the National Light Industry Conference was held in August this year, we were "generous" for a while. When we let go in entertaining the representatives, the expenditure reached more than 50 million yuan, and there were not a few wasteful expenditures. Comrade Stalin once said in his report "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policies of the Party" in April 1926: "There are shameful hidden thefts, and there are brave 'happy' thefts." Are we not engaging in the "brave 'happy' thefts" that Comrade Stalin talked about when we use the people's money to eat, drink, and live extravagantly?
    According to the materials I know, in the corruption cases that have been discovered, generally there are more field personnel than internal personnel, and more new cadres than old cadres. This shows how terrible the temptation of the outside world and the poison of the old society are!
    Some corruption and waste figures may not be large, but we should pay attention to them as well. We must not relax on small things, and making mistakes from small things is the same. Moreover, bad habits should not be cultivated. We must have a firm ideological understanding that anything that is harmful to the people, no matter how big or small, must not be done. On the other hand, we must firmly grasp our lives and not be greedy for enjoyment. The ancients said, "It is a small matter to starve to death, but a big matter to lose integrity." The essence of this sentence is wrong, but if we change a new meaning in our interpretation and regard "losing integrity" as doing something sorry to the people and losing the qualities of a revolutionary cadre, then this sentence can well educate us to be firm, hardworking and simple. - We would rather starve to death than do anything that is sorry to the people.

    Third Section: How to Handle Corruption and Waste
    "Severely punish corruption, prohibit waste" is clearly stipulated in Article 18 of the Common Program. The People's Government is launching this movement nationwide. Premier Zhou said: "We must vigorously fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy." If you commit the crime of corruption, the government will not forgive you. Not only will the People's Government not be lenient in handling it, but the people of the whole country will not be lenient either.
    The society of new China is progressing every day, and the eyes of the people are sharp. The government tries its best to achieve "no injustice, no leniency" in handling any case. The past handling of landlords, bullies, and counter-revolutionaries has completely proved this to us. If anything violates the interests of the people, the people will not forgive you. Under the principle of selfless devotion to public service, we must never allow him to do things that hinder the interests of the people because of friendship and various relationships. The attitude of the people is the most solemn.
    The people now are really lovely. Deception and exploitation could be found everywhere in the old society, but now it is not like that. Even those who sell cloth and vegetables have changed. 130,000 stall vendors in Shanghai are organized, and everyone has made a covenant to ensure that there will be no shortage of taels of weight in the transaction, and no shortage of inches of cloth.
    Since the establishment of the People's Government two years ago, the social atmosphere has basically changed. Can the people now tolerate corruption and waste by government workers! Waste must be corrected, and corrupt officials must never be treated casually.

    Fourth Section: What Methods to Use to Eliminate Corruption and Waste
    First, everyone must thoroughly transform their thinking. The moral standards of the new society must be clearly understood, and things that are harmful to the people must never be done. Everyone must make a great determination to abide by this basic principle.
    If you unintentionally do something wrong and harm the interests of the people due to insufficient experience or poor work ability, it can of course be forgiven, but it is also not good. If there is intentional corruption and waste that hinders the interests of the people, then it is absolutely unforgivable. We must all make a great determination to never embezzle, steal, or waste the people's property. Those who have done well in the past must resolutely do better in the future.
    Second, we must prevent ourselves from gradually going down the road of corruption in our behavior. It is certainly wrong to waste public money, and it is also not appropriate to waste even your own money. Because these materials are all created by the blood and sweat of the people. If someone's behavior tends to be romantic and corrupt, we must advise him and correct him in time. If the superior finds that the subordinate has a tendency to waste, they should pay more attention to prevent him from further engaging in corruption. At the same time, the subordinate can also expose the waste or corruption of the superior. Waste is the root of corruption. For the sake of public and private interests, we all hope that corruption and waste will no longer occur in the future. Even if private life is really poor, we can only think of other ways and must not casually spend public money.
    Third, the system must be strict. Those who are in charge of cashiering, managing materials, and purchasing must have complete and accurate accounts in the future. There must be a strict system for receiving and paying goods. Various systems must be established in the future where there were no regulations in the past. For example, receipts must use multi-part forms or carbon copies; the "year, month, day" of certificates must be written in full. Not only must there be sound regulations for receipt, payment, storage, etc., but also a sound inspection system must be established. The person in charge must inspect, each unit must inspect each other, and we must also mobilize the masses to inspect, and invite other agencies or even social organizations to inspect.
    We must recognize that the masses cannot be deceived. The power of the masses is irresistible. We must rely on the masses and believe that they will expose every case of corruption and waste. Those who have engaged in corruption and waste should confess first. If it is waste, we can forgive you after your confession; if it is corruption, you can also be given a lighter punishment if you confess yourself. If you do not confess yourself and are reported by others, the People's Government will never forgive you.
    We must maintain the hardworking and simple style of the People's Government organs and resolutely oppose corruption, waste, and the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses of the people. In this anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign, we must strengthen the discipline within our organs and improve the efficiency of our work. In this movement, we must also thoroughly eliminate all the toxins left over from the old society and completely reverse the atmosphere.
    Premier Zhou has given us this task, and we must thoroughly fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

专栏：

    我们要彻底地为反贪污反浪费反官僚主义而斗争
  （一九五一年十二月八日在中央轻工业部全体工作人员大会上的报告）黄炎培同志们：
    我们响应毛主席号召，展开增产节约运动，这是正面。反面呢，我们便要彻底地为反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义而斗争。
    在一九四九年人民政协讨论共同纲领草案时，草案中间就有“严惩贪污、禁止浪费”这几句话，当时大家赞成通过，但我并没有充分认识到这几句话的重要性。经过了二年的时间，果然贪污浪费的事情发生了，且不断地发生了。
    共同纲领第十八条：“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污、禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”这一条条文便是针对贪污、浪费和官僚主义的事情而说的。
    今天我的报告分做四节：
    第一节    新民主主义的道德标准
    所谓道德不道德，这件事合乎道德，那件事不合乎道德，究竟用什么标准来衡量呢？
    社会在演变，道德的标准亦在演变。在过去社会里，“忠”“孝”两个字，被认为做人主要的道德，在女性还要加上一个“节”字，这些都是封建时代的产物。
    新民主主义社会有新的道德标准。新的道德标准就是新民主主义的道德标准，就是人民民主主义的道德标准，就是一切一切都为了人民。世界是人民的世界、国家是人民的国家。我们应该把一切贡献给人民，包括自己的生命在内。这是最基本的，但也是最简单的道理。新的道德标准，就是你的行为有利于广大人民的，便是道德；有害于广大人民的，便是不道德。
    孝父母是不是对呢？在新民主主义社会里，并没有说孝父母是不对，而是说应该更广的更多的为人民服务。如果为了孝父母而脱离了广大人民，便是不对。参加抗美援朝对呢？在家服侍父母对呢？在新的道德标准下，便应该选择前一条。如果一方面参加革命工作，另一方面尽可能在精神上、物质上孝父母，这是完全对的。为人民服务并不是说对父母不管，“子女对于父母有赡养扶助的义务”，这是中华人民共和国婚姻法第十三条所规定的。
    新的道德标准是：有利于广大人民的，便是道德，有害于广大人民的，便是不道德。如果我们承认这个标准，那末，假定有人把人民所有物资或财产，用不正当的方法去取得，或者在不必要的情况下去消耗，这样好不好呢？合不合乎道德呢？当然要不得。所谓用不正当方法取得人民的财物，便是贪污，所谓在不必要情况下消耗人民的财物，便是浪费。
    共同纲领第四十二条：“提倡爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物为中华人民共和国全体国民的公德。”怎样是爱护公共财物呢？就是对于使用公共的物资和财产，我们都应该节约，应该爱惜保护。那么，把公的变做私的，更要不得了。
    浪费已经是不对的了，贪污当然更要不得。我们反贪污、反浪费，是完全符合于共同纲领的原则的。
    第二节    贪污浪费的来源
    贪污、浪费是犯罪的、错误的行为。这道理粗浅得很，人人懂得。为什么在我们新社会里还会有贪污浪费的现象呢？
    我们新社会有三大敌人：封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义。这三个敌人虽然在国内被打倒了，在某些人脑海里还没有打倒，这些敌人遗留下来的毒素还随时随地在作怪。封建社会，大多数人受少数人的压迫和剥削，大家都尽可能想把东西往自己口袋里装，不管来源正当不正当，总是能多拿一些，就多拿一些，这是很自然的。在封建统治下，偷窃也要受统治阶级特制法律的处分的，所谓“不当利得”。即使被压迫、被剥削的人，由于生活逼迫而偷窃了人家一些东西，也要受罚的。但是统治阶级自己大量的偷窃，无罪。在蒋匪帮统治时代，四大家族搜刮、剥削人民，法律是管不到的。对日抗战中间，我在重庆当国民参政员，提出过不少弹劾贪污案件，一牵涉到豪门，就“石沉大海”，毫无影响。
    贪污在中国已经有几千年历史了。我们新中国成立才二年，要完全摆脱旧社会遗毒的影响是很难的一件事。我们要提高警惕。周总理告诉我们：一九四九年二月中国共产党召开二中全会时，当时革命形势已开展了，毛主席告诫党内：“同志们，我们现在要和许多旧社会出身的人合作了。我们要小心，要预防旧社会的坏风气钻到中国共产党身上来。”现在想想，毛主席真是有先见之明。
    贪污浪费，在个别共产党员也是有的。绝大部分还是旧社会人员。贪污浪费事情的产生，主要有两个原因：一、思想问题。社会已经转变了，但是人们的认识还没有都转变。有些人根本就是思想没有改造，对新民主主义的道德标准没有认识清楚。二、物质生活的诱惑，要求吃的用的一切都好，好了，还要好，尽量地贪图享受。自己口袋里钱不够，入不敷出，怎么办呢？起先是借，但老是借，不是办法，一有机会到来，假公济私，逢到出差去采办材料，造一篇假帐，一次得手，以后越贪越大。贪污是逐渐养成和发展的，可以说立志贪污的人倒也没有的。
    贪污浪费不是小事情，根据我所知道的数字，两年来，由于贪污浪费所造成的对国家财产的损失是非常的大，大得吓人。
    也有人说：“贪污可能是为了穷的缘故，待遇高些，就好了。”这样看法，并不完全对。根据北京市的材料，在已经发现的一百五十三件贪污案中，只有一件是因为穷，其余的贪污犯都并不穷。即使是真正穷，也应该想其他办法，贪污总是不行。
    贪污要不得，浪费是不是可以原谅呢？同志们！贪污和浪费当然有所不同，但同样不可以原谅。
    我们用的都是老百姓的钱，中央轻工业部一向注意节约，人家说我们是“小气”的，但今年八月间开全国轻工业会议时，“大气”了一下，在招待代表时一放手，开支达五千多万元，其中浪费的不在少数。斯大林同志在一九二六年四月“论苏联经济形势与党的政策”这一报告中曾经说过：“有可耻的隐蔽的盗窃行为，有勇敢的‘快乐的’盗窃行为。”我们把人民的钱，用来大吃大喝，铺张浪费，不就是斯大林同志所说的“勇敢的‘快乐的’盗窃行为”么！
    根据我所知道的材料，在已经发现的贪污案中，一般是外勤多于内勤，新干部多于老干部。这说明了外界的诱惑和旧社会的遗毒是多么可怕！
    有些贪污、浪费的数字虽然不大，但同样要注意。我们不要放松小事情，由小而大，犯错误是一样的。而且坏习惯是养成不得的。我们必须从思想上认识坚定，凡是有害于人民的事，无论大小都干不得。另一方面，生活上必须好好地紧紧地掌握，不要贪图享受。古人说：“饿死事小，失节事大”。这句话本质是错误的，但如果我们在解释上换一种新的内容，把“失节”当作干对不起人民的事，丧失革命干部的品质，那末，这句话便可以很好的教育我们坚苦朴素了。—我们宁可饿死，决不做对不起老百姓的事情。
    第三节    对贪污浪费的处理办法
    “严惩贪污、禁止浪费”，是共同纲领第十八条已经明确规定了的。人民政府正在全国范围内展开这个运动。周总理说：“我们一定要大张旗鼓的来反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义。”如果犯了贪污罪，政府是不原谅的。不仅人民政府处理上不予宽容，全国人民都不会宽容。
    新中国的社会每天都在进步，人民的眼睛是雪亮的。政府处理任何案件，都尽量做到“无枉无纵”，过去对地主、恶霸和反革命分子的处理，已经完全为我们证明了这一点。任何一件事情，如果违反了人民的利益，人民便不能饶恕你。在大公无私的原则下，绝对不能因交情和种种关系，允许他干妨碍人民利益的事，人民的态度是最严正的。
    现在的人民真是可爱。旧社会随处可以发见欺骗、剥削的事，现在不这样了。连卖布卖菜的都改变了。上海十三万摊贩都组织起来，大家订了公约，保证在买卖上不少一两秤，不缺一寸布。
    人民政府成立两年以来，社会风气已经基本转变，现在的人民还能容忍政府工作人员的贪污浪费么！对浪费现象必须加以纠正，对贪污犯更绝对不能马虎了事。
    第四节    用什么方法来消灭贪污
                浪费
    第一、每个人要把自己的思想彻底改造。新社会的道德标准，必须认识清楚，有害于人民的事情绝对不能做。对这一个基本大原则，大家必须下大决心来遵守。
    如果由于经验不够，或者工作能力差，无意中做错了事情，损害了人民利益，当然还可以原谅，但也是不好的。如果有意的贪污浪费，妨害人民利益，便绝对不可饶恕。我们大家要下绝大决心，无论如何不做侵占、盗窃或浪费人民财物的事。过去已经做得很好的，今后要坚决地做得更好。
    第二、要在行为上防止逐渐走上腐化的道路。把公家的钱浪费，固然不对，即使用自己的钱，也不应该浪费。因为这些物资，都是老百姓血汗造成的。如果有人行为倾向浪漫、腐化，我们便要及时的劝告他、纠正他。上级如果发现下级有浪费的倾向，更要注意，防他进一步干出贪污。同时下级也可以揭发上级浪费或贪污。浪费是贪污的根源。我们为公为私，都希望大家以后不再发生贪污浪费的现象。即使私人生活实在穷困，只有想别的办法，决不能随便消耗公家的钱。
    第三、制度要严密。当出纳的、管物资的、当采购的，今后帐据必须完备正确，无论收付财物，都要有严密的制度。过去没有规定的，以后要建立各种制度。举一个例，收据必须用联单或复写；证件“年、月、日”必须全写。不仅要有健全的收付保管种种规定，还要建立健全的检查制度。主管人员要检查，各单位要相互检查，还要发动群众检查，还要邀请其他机关或更邀请社会团体来检查。
    我们必须认识群众是不可欺的。群众力量是不可抗的。我们必须倚靠群众，相信他们对每一件贪污、浪费的事，都会揭发出来的。有贪污、浪费行为的人，自己应该先坦白。如果是浪费，自己坦白后，我们可以原谅；如果是贪污，自己坦白的，也可以从轻处分，如果自己不坦白，由别人检举出来，人民政府是绝不宽恕的了。
    我们一定要保持人民政府机关艰苦朴素的作风，坚决反对贪污、浪费和脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。在这一次反贪污、反浪费的运动中，我们必须加强我们机关内部的纪律，提高我们工作的效率。这一次运动，我们还要彻底消灭一般旧社会遗留下来的种种毒素，把风气完全扭转过来。
    周总理交给我们这一任务，我们必须彻底地为反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义而斗争。
