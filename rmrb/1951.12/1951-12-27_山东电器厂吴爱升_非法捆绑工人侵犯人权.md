    Wu Aisheng of Shandong Electric Appliance Factory
    Illegally Bound Workers, Violating Human Rights
    Editor: Wu Aisheng (Communist Party member), a security cadre at the Shandong Electric Appliance Factory in Zibo City, disregards the law and dared to bind worker Zhao Yuanpei (a member of the Youth League) and illegally extort a confession, creating a very bad influence. The leading authorities should correct this.

    The workers' cafeteria at this factory lost over seventy jin of millet meal tickets in August. Security cadre Wu Aisheng believed that Zhao Yuanpei, a worker in the sand casting shop, often went to the kitchen, and because he bought few meal tickets, he must have stolen them. On September 28, Zhao Yuanpei was off work due to illness, and Wu called him to the dormitory and demanded that he admit to stealing the meal tickets. When Zhao did not admit it, Wu took him to the guard squad and ordered the guards to tie him up tightly, saying, "Let's see if you admit it!" At that time, Zheng Jianjun (deputy secretary of the Party General Branch Committee), deputy director of the personnel office, walked in, but did not stop this illegal behavior, only glanced at him and left. Zhao was bound for more than half an hour, and his arms were numb and unbearable, so he hardened his heart and confessed. That evening, the factory director did not conduct an investigation, but convened a factory-wide staff meeting and announced the matter. Afterwards, Zhao felt more and more wronged and asked the trade union and the Youth League General Branch Committee to conduct an in-depth investigation. But this matter has not been thoroughly resolved to this day. This serious violation of human rights is illegal, and we hope that relevant parties will seriously investigate and deal with this matter.    Chu Dianzhong

    山东电器厂吴爱升
    非法捆绑工人侵犯人权
    编辑同志：淄博市山东电器厂保卫干事吴爱升（共产党员），目无法纪，竟敢捆绑工人赵源培（青年团员），非法逼供，造成极坏的影响，领导机关应予纠正。
    这个厂的工人食堂在八月份丢失了七十多斤小米的饭票。保卫干事吴爱升认为翻沙间工人赵源培常到伙房去玩，饭票又买得少，一定是他偷的。九月二十八日，赵源培因病歇工，吴把他叫到宿舍里，要他承认偷饭票的事。赵不承认，吴就带他到警卫班，命令警卫员把他紧绑起来，说：“看你承认不承认！”当时，人事室副主任郑健俊（党总支委员会副书记）走进来，也不制止这种非法行为，只看了几眼就走了。赵被缚半个多钟点，两臂麻木难忍，因此，狠狠心就承认了。当晚，这个厂的厂长也不进行调查研究，就召开全厂职工大会，宣布了这件事。事后，赵越想越冤，要求工会和青年团总支委员会作深入调查。但这件事到现在还没有得到彻底解决。这种严重的侵犯人权行为是犯法的，希望有关方面认真检查处理这件事。    初佃忠
