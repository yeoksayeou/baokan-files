Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: Since the news that the Korean armistice negotiation delegation reached an agreement on the military demarcation line for the armistice on November 27th reached the U.S. invading forces, U.S. invading soldiers, who had long been tired of the war, once automatically stopped shooting on the Korean battlefield and implemented a ceasefire. By the next day, according to a Reuters dispatch, even the U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters had to admit that "the front line had fallen into an unbelievable state of silence." A Reuters reporter said: "An idea is rapidly spreading among the UN troops that Tuesday's agreement on the ceasefire line means the cessation of almost all fighting."

    The fact that the U.S. invading army was weary of war caused great panic and confusion in the U.S. government. They hurriedly denied the news that had already been spread by American and British news agencies, while repeatedly forcing U.S. soldiers to continue fighting. On November 28th, the Eighth Army Headquarters specifically issued a statement emphasizing that "there is no ceasefire in Korea" and "warned the troops to remain vigilant." On the same day, the Department of Defense in Washington also issued a special communique, denying that the front line had ceased fire, and announced that it had asked Ridgway to "clarify the situation." Even U.S. President Truman, who was on vacation on Key West Island, specially summoned Army Deputy Chief of Staff Hull and Assistant Secretary of State Matthews to report to him, and then his press secretary Short declared: "There will be no ceasefire in Korea until the armistice is signed." Within November 29th, from Van Fleet in Korea, Ridgway in Tokyo, to Truman in Key West, successively issued statements stating that there was no ceasefire in Korea. Truman particularly emphasized: "I hope everyone understands that there is no ceasefire in Korea now; there cannot be a ceasefire in Korea until the armistice agreement is signed. Our responsibility is to continue our efforts until the goals of the United Nations are achieved."

    However, neither the American generals and presidents, nor the so-called "goals of the United Nations," can apparently reignite the morale of the American soldiers who are fundamentally dissatisfied with this war of aggression. A Reuters correspondent with the U.S. forces revealed the soldiers’ longing for peace in a November 29th dispatch: At the front, "the most common comment on the current situation is 'God willing, the negotiations will succeed'." Major General Claudius M. Easley, commander of the U.S. invading army's 3rd Infantry Division, also admitted on December 1st that there had been "slackness" in the troops.

    The situation on the Korean front made the U.S. officials as anxious as ants on a hot pan. Truman's press secretary, Short, issued another "secret document" on November 30th, proving that the Eighth Army had been ordered on November 26th to "continue fighting." He angrily rebuked the reporters on the Korean front for sending out the news that a ceasefire had been reached in an attempt to "confuse the American people." However, Short's curse was sharply refuted by the Associated Press on the same day, arguing that his "statement cannot change the facts, the factual evidence is conclusive and self-evident." Moreover, even Short himself had to admit that Hull had told Truman that although the Eighth Army headquarters had not issued a ceasefire order, the lower-level soldiers were indeed unwilling to fight, and the news of the ceasefire "apparently came from the company or platoon, or possibly the squad." Under the strict supervision of Washington, according to U.S. news agencies, the command headquarters at all levels on the Korean front have repeatedly ordered to continue fighting "ruthlessly." The U.S. authorities, who are currently delaying negotiations and claiming to "cherish the lives of American soldiers," have once again exposed their bloody face to the people of the world, not hesitating to use the lives of American soldiers as gambling chips.

### 美军士兵急于停火  美统治集团大为恐慌

    美军士兵急于停火
    美统治集团大为恐慌
     【新华社六日讯】自朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会在十一月二十七日就双方停战军事分界线获得协议的消息传到美国侵略军队中以后，对战争早已厌倦的美国侵略军士兵曾一度自动在朝鲜战场上停止射击，实行停火。到第二天，据路透社发出的消息透露，连美国第八军总部都已不得不承认“前线已陷入了不可思议的沉寂状态”。路透社记者说：“联合国军士兵中迅速地传布着一种想法，星期二关于停火线的协议就意味着停止差不多全部的战斗。”
    美国侵略军中这种兵心厌战的事实刚一传出，就引起了美国政府的极大的恐慌和混乱。它们急忙否认美英各通讯社已经传播出去的消息，同时三令五申地逼迫美国士兵们继续作战。十一月二十八日当天，第八军总部就特地发表声明，强调“朝鲜并没有停火”，并“告诫部队必须继续警戒”。同一天，在华盛顿的国防部也发表特别公报，否认前线业已停火，并宣布已要求李奇微“澄清局势”。甚至远在基韦斯特海岛上休假的美国总统杜鲁门也专门召见陆军副参谋长胡尔和助理国务卿马休斯向他报告情况，并且接着就由他的新闻秘书萧特声明：“在停战没有签字以前，朝鲜停火是不会有的事。”在十一月二十九日一天之内，从在朝鲜的范佛里特，在东京的李奇微，到在基韦斯特的杜鲁门，都连续发表声明，说明朝鲜还没有停火。杜鲁门特别强调：“我希望每个人都了解，现在朝鲜还没有停火；在停战协议尚未签字以前，朝鲜不可能停火。我们的责任是继续努力，直到达到联合国的目标为止。”
    但是，不论是美国的将军和总统也好，所谓“联合国的目标”也好，显然都不能重新鼓起根本不满这个侵略战争的美国士兵的士气。路透社随军记者十一月二十九日发出的消息透露了前线士兵渴望和平的情绪说：在前线，“对目前形势最常见的评论是‘愿上帝使谈判成功’”。美国侵略军第三师师长克劳斯，也在十二月一日承认部队已发生了“松懈现象”。
    朝鲜前线的这种情况使美国官方急得像油锅上的蚂蚁。杜鲁门的新闻秘书萧特在十一月三十日又发表了一项“秘密文件”，证明第八军曾在十一月二十六日奉命“继续打下去”。他恼怒地申斥朝鲜前线的记者们发出已经停火的消息是想“混淆美国人民的视听”。但是萧特这种咒骂当天就受到了美联社尖锐的反驳，认为他的“说法改变不了事实，事实证据确凿，不辩自明”。而且，连萧特自己也不能不承认胡尔曾经告诉杜鲁门，虽然第八军军部并没有下过停火的命令，然而下层士兵却确实不愿打仗，停火的消息“显然是从营或连，或者可能是排里发出的”。在华盛顿的严厉督促下，据美国各通讯社透露：朝鲜前线的各级司令部都纷纷再度下令要“毫不留情地”继续作战。目前正在继续拖延谈判的自称为“爱惜美国士兵生命”的美国当局，就这样在全世界人民面前再次暴露了他们不惜将美国士兵的生命作为赌具的血腥面目。
