    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 4th: As the military, diplomatic, and economic leaders of the North Atlantic bloc converge in Rome to plot aggressive war deployments, the Italian people are reaffirming their will to defend peace and expressing their opposition to this war conference through powerful actions.
    On November 24th, the same day as the opening of the so-called North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, the Italian people held their own conference in Rome – the "Italian National Congress for Peace and Disarmament." Participating in this congress, initiated by the Italian National Peace Council, were 500 representatives from all walks of life across Italy, including workers, farmers, intellectuals, government officials, and generals. Representatives from different parties and with different political views who spoke at the meeting condemned the Gasperi government for pursuing the U.S.'s policy of arms expansion and war preparations. The two-day congress passed a "Letter to the Italian People," protesting against "foreign ministers, cabinet members, and generals coming to the Italian capital to plot expansion of armaments and war, which endanger Italy." The "Letter to the Italian People" advocated for a five-power conference to resolve international issues peacefully, and called on all people to demand that Italian territory become a place for countries to discuss peace and universal disarmament, rather than a place to hold war conferences.
    The people of Rome and other parts of Italy immediately responded to this call. The reactionary Gasperi government attempted to suppress the people's will for peace. The police authorities in Rome ordered a ban on protest gatherings and demonstrations. However, the working people of Rome, disregarding the government's ban, held a general strike and demonstration to protest the North Atlantic bloc war conference, initiated by the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. At 4:00 PM on the 27th, all workers stopped work together. Tens of thousands of working people broke through the heavy police blockade and demonstrated in the streets and squares of the city center. Demonstrators crowded in the squares and streets in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Parliament, chanting slogans such as "Peace!", "Drive out the foreigners!", and "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty!", and distributed tens of thousands of leaflets against the North Atlantic Treaty. The demonstration lasted until 8:00 PM. The vicinity of the building where the North Atlantic bloc representatives were holding their meeting was covered with the word "Peace." Dozens of clashes occurred between angry crowds and the police on the streets of Rome.
    The protest movement quickly spread, and large-scale demonstrations were held in many provincial capitals and major industrial cities, including Milan, Bologna, Reggio, Naples, Livorno, Florence, Prato, and others. Agricultural workers throughout the Apulia region in southern Italy also went on strike to protest the U.S. occupation of bases in Italy.

    意大利人民举行示威
    抗议北大西洋集团战争会议
    【新华社四日讯】罗马消息：正当北大西洋集团各国的军事、外交和经济首脑麕集罗马、策划侵略战争部署的时候，意大利人民重申他们保卫和平的意志，以强有力的行动表示了他们反对这个战争会议。
    十一月二十四日，也就是所谓北大西洋公约理事会的会议开幕的同日，意大利人民在罗马举行了他们自己的会议——“意大利全国争取和平与裁军大会”。参加这一由意大利全国和平理事会发起的大会的，有意大利全国各地各阶层人民的代表五百人，他们当中有工人、农民和知识分子，还有政府官员和将军。在会上发言的不同党派、不同政见的代表都谴责加斯贝利政府推行美国的扩军备战政策。为期两天的大会通过“告意大利人民书”，抗议“外国部长、大臣和将军们到意大利首都来策划危害意大利的扩张军备运动和战争”。“告意大利人民书”主张举行五大国会议，用和平方法解决国际问题，并号召全体人民起来要求使意大利领土成为各国讨论和平和普遍裁军问题的地方，而不是举行战争会议的地方。
    罗马和意大利其他地方的人民立即响应了这个号召。反动的加斯贝利政府曾企图压制人民的和平意志。罗马的警察当局下令禁止抗议的集会示威。但是罗马的劳动人民不顾政府的禁令，在省工会理事会发起下举行了抗议北大西洋集团战争会议的总罢工和示威游行。二十七日下午四点钟，全体工人一齐停止工作。成万的劳动人民冲破警察的重重封锁，到市中心各街道和广场举行示威。示威者密集在外交部和议会面前的广场和街道上，高呼“和平！”、“把外国人赶出去！”、“打倒北大西洋公约！”等口号，并散发了成万份反对北大西洋公约的传单。示威一直延续到晚上八点钟。北大西洋集团的代表举行会议的大厦附近到处涂满了“和平”的字样。在罗马的各街道上，愤怒的人群与警察发生了数十起冲突。
    抗议运动迅速扩展，在许多省会和大工业城市，包括米兰、波伦亚、勒佐、那不勒斯、里窝那、佛罗伦萨、普拉托等，人民都举行了大规模的示威。意大利南部阿浦利亚区全区的农业工人也举行罢工，抗议美国占领意大利的基地。
