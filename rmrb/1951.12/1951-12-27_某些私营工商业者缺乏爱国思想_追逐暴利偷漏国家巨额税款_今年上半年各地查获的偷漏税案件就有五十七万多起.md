Private industrial and commercial businessmen in various regions, amidst the patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the nation, have successively established patriotic pacts, put forward the slogan of "no tax arrears, no tax evasion," and launched collective tax payment campaigns. These patriotic actions are excellent. However, on the other hand, many facts prove that the phenomenon of tax evasion by some private industrial and commercial businessmen is still very common, and the figures for evaded taxes are shocking. According to statistics, in the first half of 1951, more than 570,000 cases of tax evasion were uncovered across the country; tax evasion is prevalent in large, medium, and small cities. In the East China region, more than 138,500 cases of tax evasion were uncovered from January to August, with evaded taxes totaling more than 29.7 billion yuan. In Shanghai, an inspection of 4,598 industrial and commercial businesses in 186 industries revealed that 3,087 of them had evaded taxes, accounting for 67% of all businesses inspected. In Tianjin, as of November 29, more than 35,500 industrial and commercial businesses had confessed and supplemented their tax declarations after tax inspections, with the supplemented turnover equivalent to 8.54% of the total turnover of private industrial and commercial businesses in the first half of the year. For example, Ren Haiqi, Yin Gengxiang, Yin ZhengGuo and others, managers of the private "Shanghai Manufacturers North China United Office" in Tianjin, used illegal means to evade more than one billion yuan in taxes. They bribed and corrupted state cadres, undermined national economic construction, and caused huge losses to the country. A recent survey of 18 machine metal manufacturing businesses in Beijing revealed that the average undeclared turnover was 34% of the original declared amount; among 30 native produce and food businesses, only five declared truthfully, with the remaining undeclared turnover averaging 26.78%. In the Beijing grain industry, three joint ventures established businesses in seven locations, including Wuxi and Xushui, and did not enter them into the main account books. After being discovered, they admitted that it was off-the-books capital and supplemented their tax declaration by one billion yuan. A new medicine and medical equipment store in Wuhan, even after several supplementary declarations, still had 5.08% of its turnover untaxed according to investigation results. Another cotton wool factory had a turnover of one billion yuan that was not taxed. Tax evasion is also very serious among small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses with incomplete accounting books. In Chongqing this autumn, an audit of 817 industrial and commercial businesses revealed that 535 of them had evaded taxes, accounting for 65% of the total number of businesses audited, with an average tax evasion rate of 55%. In Shenyang, many serious tax evasion behaviors were discovered in just a few days of auditing work in November. For example, the joint paper store of the paper industry paid only 65% of the business tax that should have been paid from January to September, and only 73.7% of the income tax that should have been paid. From January to September, the Ziheng Factory in Shenyang paid only 36.4% of the business tax that should have been paid and only 4.3% of the income tax that should have been paid. The situation of tax evasion in industrial and commercial circles in other regions is also widespread and serious.

The basic reason for tax evasion is that some industrial and commercial businessmen still lack patriotism, do not abide by government laws and decrees, and use the shameful method of tax evasion to harm national interests in order to increase their own wealth. For example, 293 stores in Changzhou used bribery to collude with some corrupt elements in the tax authorities in order to achieve their tax evasion purposes. Secondly, some tax personnel are ideologically paralyzed, do not fully recognize the seriousness of tax evasion, and allow it to develop unchecked; some tax personnel have conservative ideas, follow old practices, and only check the books when auditing accounts; and in democratic appraisals, they did not grasp sufficient materials, and did not rely well on employees and shop assistants, unite progressive industrial and commercial businessmen, and carry out their work; they also lack systematic investigation and research on tax sources. This also creates gaps for some illegal industrial and commercial businessmen to evade taxes.

    某些私营工商业者缺乏爱国思想
    追逐暴利偷漏国家巨额税款
    今年上半年各地查获的偷漏税案件就有五十七万多起
    各地私营工商业者，在抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动中，纷纷订立爱国公约，提出了“不欠税、不偷税”的口号，并展开了集体纳税运动，这种爱国行动是很好的。但是，另一方面，许多事实证明：若干私营工商业者偷税漏税现象仍很普遍，偷漏税款的数字十分惊人。据统计，一九五一年上半年全国各地查获的偷税漏税的案件，共有五十七万多起；偷税漏税现象，遍及大中小城市。华东区各地一月到八月查获的偷漏税款案件就有十三万八千五百多起，偷漏税款有二百九十七亿多元。上海市检查了一百八十六个行业四千五百九十八户工商业者，其中偷税漏税的就有三千零八十七户，占全部被检查户的百分之六十七。天津市截至十一月二十九日止，经过查税，已有三万五千五百多户工商业者坦白补报漏税，补报的营业额相当于本年上半年私营工商业营业总额的百分之八点五四。如，天津市私营“上海厂商华北联合办事处”经理任海岐、殷赓祥、印镇国等，利用非法手段偷漏税款十亿多元，他们贿赂腐蚀国家干部，破坏国家经济建设，使国家遭受巨大损失。北京市最近调查了十八户机器金属制造业，平均漏报营业额为原申报额的百分之三十四；三十户土产食品业中，仅有五户申报真实，其余漏报营业额平均为百分之二十六点七八。北京粮食业中，有三家合资在无锡、徐水等七处设庄经营，不入本柜账簿。经查出后，他们承认是账外资金，补报漏税十亿元。武汉市一家新药医疗器械行，虽经过几次补报，但据调查结果，仍有百分之五点○八的营业额没有纳税。又有一家药棉厂，有营业额十亿元没有纳税。账簿不健全的中、小工商业户，偷漏税的现象也很严重。重庆市本年秋季对八百一十七户工商业者进行查账，其中偷税漏税的有五百三十五户，占查账总户数的百分之六十五，平均偷漏所得税百分之五十五。沈阳市在十一月份几天的查账工作中，就发现了很多严重的偷税漏税行为。如纸店业共同纸行，一至九月所纳的营业税，只占应纳的百分之六十五；所纳所得税，只占应纳的百分之七十三点七。沈阳市子衡工厂一至九月份所纳的营业税，只占应纳的百分之三十六点四；所纳所得税只占应纳的百分之四点三。其他各地工商业界的偷税漏税的情况也很普遍和严重。
    偷税漏税的基本原因，是某些工商业者还缺乏爱国思想，不遵守政府法令，用偷税漏税的可耻办法，损害国家利益，以增加他们自己的财富。像常州市的二百九十三家商店，竟用贿赂的手段，勾结税务机关中的某些贪污分子，来达到他们偷税的目的。其次，有些税务工作人员思想麻痹，对偷税漏税的严重情况认识不足，放任自流；有些税务工作人员有保守思想，因袭老一套的做法，查账时只是就账查账；而在民主评议时，他们也没有掌握充分材料，更没有很好地依靠职工店员，团结进步的工商业者，进行工作；他们对税源也缺乏系统的调查研究。这也给一些不法工商业者造成偷税漏税的空隙。    （华林）
