    Guilin Industrial School, Guangxi Province
    Should Strengthen Education on Cherishing Public Property
    Editor: Although our Guilin Industrial School in Guangxi Province has a clause in its patriotic pact that states "Absolutely cherish public property and do not waste the people's property," the fact is that some of our students do not cherish public property at all.
    Last semester, a first-year student in the civil engineering department carelessly damaged the glass on the compass of a standard theodolite during an internship, rendering the compass inoperable and turning it into scrap, resulting in a loss of 70 million yuan. At the beginning of this semester, the engine, which had only been in trial use for a short time, was damaged again, not only causing economic losses but also seriously affecting students' internships. Another first-year student in the civil engineering department broke the bubble level of a new theodolite borrowed from another agency, resulting in a loss of more than 30 million yuan. The above are just a few prominent examples.
    The main reason for this phenomenon is that the school leadership has not seriously educated the students on cherishing public property; nor has it given appropriate treatment to students who casually damage valuable instruments. This is intolerable. I suggest that the school leadership strengthen the patriotic education of students and formulate concrete and practical measures to prevent the continued occurrence of damage to valuable instruments.

### 广西省桂林工业学校  应加强爱护公共财物的教育

    广西省桂林工业学校
    应加强爱护公共财物的教育
    编辑同志：我们广西省桂林工业学校的爱国公约中，虽然有“绝对爱护公物，不浪费人民的财产”的条文，但事实上，我校一部分同学对于公共财物是毫不爱护的。
    上学期有一位土木科一年级同学，在实习时，由于不小心，把一副标准经纬仪罗盘上的玻璃打坏，致使罗盘失灵，成了废品，损失了七千万元。本学期开始时，试用不久的发动机又被弄坏了，不但招致了经济上的损失，而且严重地影响了同学们作实习。土木科一年级另一个同学，又把一副从别的机关借来的新经纬仪的水泡打破，损失也在三千万元以上。以上只是些较显著的例子。
    造成这种现象的原因，主要是由于学校领导方面没有认真地对同学进行爱护公共财产的教育；对随便损坏贵重仪器的同学也没有给予适当的处理。这是不能容忍的。我建议学校领导方面加强对同学的爱国主义教育，并订出具体切实的办法，以防止损坏贵重仪器事件的继续发生。
