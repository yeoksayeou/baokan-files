Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: At the subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 9th, the other side still refused to state its position on our proposal for both sides to jointly invite neutral countries to establish a supervisory body. Since we put forward two supplementary principles and suggestions on December 3rd in order to quickly resolve the third item on the agenda, the other side has refused to express a clear attitude on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has used various absurd arguments to insist on all the unreasonable suggestions and demands it had previously made. On the 8th, the other side openly claimed that our rear islands and sea "are no more within Korea than seawater or anything else outside of Korea," and insisted on retaining its armed forces in our rear. On the 9th, the other side even more absurdly claimed that "when an airplane is flying overhead, it does not penetrate deeply into the rear," and insisted on so-called aerial observation and photography in our rear; it also claimed that reconnaissance of "the entire territory of Korea is not the rear," and insisted on so-called "free inspection" in our rear. Our representative sternly pointed out at the subcommittee meeting on the 9th that we have always advocated that a high-level political conference be held promptly after the armistice to decide on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and to completely peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Therefore, we originally believed that there was no need for inspections in the rear of both sides during the armistice. However, because the other side expressed fear of our military strength, requested restrictions on military strength during the armistice, and inspections in the rear of both sides, and we absolutely cannot allow the other side to interfere in our internal affairs, we suggested that during the armistice, neither side should transport any military forces, weapons, or ammunition from outside Korea, and invite neutral countries to supervise this provision and conduct inspections. Now, the other side is attempting to increase its troops during the armistice, still unreasonably demanding rotation and replenishment of its armed forces and weapons and ammunition, and fearing impartial supervision by neutral countries, still insisting that the armistice committee composed of the belligerent parties directly inspect the rear of both sides. Our representative clearly pointed out that if the other side demands restrictions on the military strength of both sides during the armistice, it cannot demand rotation and replenishment; if the other side demands rear inspections, it cannot reject impartial supervision and inspection by neutral countries. The question now is either to agree to neutral countries inspecting the rear, or not to have rear inspections at all. The other side cannot escape this choice by any means. At the meeting, in addition to repeating its unreasonable demands to interfere in our internal affairs and threaten our rear, which we have resolutely rejected long ago, and its absurd proposition of both fearing our military strength and not giving up increasing its own military strength, the other side had no words to answer our righteous questioning. Before the end of the meeting, we once again reminded the other side that it could not evade expressing its attitude towards our supplementary suggestions, and we would wait for the other side's reply at the meeting on the 10th.

### 美方对我补充建议仍拒绝表示态度  我严斥美方无理要求并等待答复

    美方对我补充建议仍拒绝表示态度
    我严斥美方无理要求并等待答复 【新华社开城九日电】九日的朝鲜停战谈判的小组委员会上，对方对于我方所提出的双方共同邀请中立国家成立监察机构的建议，仍然拒绝表示态度。自从十二月三日我方为了迅速解决第三项议程，提出两项补充原则建议后，对方一方面拒绝表示明确态度，另一方面更使用各种荒谬绝伦的论点，坚持对方曾经提出过的所有无理建议与要求。八日对方公然声称我方后方岛屿与海面“和海水与其他任何朝鲜以外的东西一样，不在朝鲜境内”，而坚持在我方后方保留其武装力量。九日，对方更荒谬地声称“当飞机在上空飞行时，它并没有深入后方”，而坚持在我方后方进行所谓空中观察与摄影；又称侦察“朝鲜全境不是后方”，而坚持在我后方进行所谓“自由视察”。我方代表在九日的小组会上，严词指出：我方一贯主张停战后迅速举行高级政治会议，决定自朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，并彻底和平解决朝鲜问题，因此我方原来认为停战期间并无在双方后方视察的必要。但由于对方表示畏惧我方的军事力量，要求在停战期间限制军力，并在双方后方进行视察，而我方决不能容许对方干涉我内政，因此我方建议在停战期间双方均不得自朝鲜境外运进任何军事力量与武器、弹药，并邀请中立国家担任监督这一规定并进行视察的任务。现对方却又企图在停战期间增加自己的兵力，仍然无理要求轮换与补充其武装部队与武器弹药，并惧怕中立国进行公正的监督，仍然坚持由交战双方所组成的停战委员会直接到双方后方进行视察。我方代表明确指出：如果对方要求限制停战期间双方的军事力量，就不能要求轮换与补充；如果对方要求进行后方视察，就不能拒绝中立国的公正的监督和视察。现在的问题是要么就是同意中立国到后方视察，要么就根本不要后方视察。对方用什么办法也不能逃避这个抉择。对方在会议上除反复其早已为我方所断然拒绝了的干涉我方内政及威胁我方后方的无理要求，和既怕我方军力，但又不放弃增加其本身军力的荒唐主张外，对我方义正词严的质问，始终无词以对。会议结束前，我方再次提醒对方，对方不能逃避对我方补充建议表示态度，我方将在十日会上等待对方的答复。
