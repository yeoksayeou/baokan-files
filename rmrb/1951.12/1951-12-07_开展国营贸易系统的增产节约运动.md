    The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has decided to launch a production increase and thrift campaign in state-owned trading enterprises nationwide, striving for a total production increase and savings value of 11 trillion RMB in national state-owned trading enterprises in 1952. This is a major battle cry for all state-owned trade employees across the country.
    Over the past two years, state-owned trading enterprises nationwide have developed considerably and have become an important force in the state-owned economy. Under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and local governments at all levels, all employees of state-owned trading enterprises have worked together and made considerable achievements in stabilizing prices, supporting and developing production, ensuring the supply of daily necessities for the people, and developing foreign trade. However, the operation and management of state-owned trading enterprises still have many shortcomings, especially the slow turnover of funds and the high cost of commodity circulation. There are also many wasteful phenomena in organizational structure, storage, and transportation. Therefore, to achieve the production increase and thrift plan for state-owned trading enterprises, we must strengthen operation and management and eliminate waste.
    The central slogan for launching the production increase and thrift campaign in state-owned trading enterprises is "accelerate capital turnover" and "reduce commodity circulation costs." In terms of accelerating capital turnover, it is required to significantly accelerate the capital turnover rate in 1952 compared to 1951, saving funds up to 8 trillion RMB, so that the state can invest more funds in industrial construction. In terms of reducing commodity circulation costs, it is required to reduce the cost rate by 2.33 percentage points in 1952 compared to 1951, saving commodity circulation costs up to 3 trillion RMB, to increase the state's fiscal revenue. To achieve this goal, state-owned trading enterprises nationwide must continue to conscientiously clear assets, verify funds, determine reasonable inventory levels, and reduce the phenomenon of commodity backlog. We must launch an active sales campaign, strive to expand sales volume, overcome conservative reluctance to sell, improve service to consumers, and change the phenomenon of unsalable goods in some enterprises; we must improve the labor productivity of all employees, streamline management organizations, strengthen grassroots units, reduce non-direct business personnel, and increase direct business personnel. Strengthen the connections between upper and lower levels within state-owned trading enterprises, between various enterprises, and between various work departments, strengthen the connections between state-owned trading enterprises and other state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises, gradually implement the work quota system, establish collective contracts between enterprise administration and employees and connection contracts between enterprises and enterprises and between departments, stipulate work regulations for each enterprise and each department, stipulate operating procedures for various types of staff, and establish individual work plans based on the plans of each unit; we must launch a large-scale thrift campaign, reduce business expenses, reduce natural losses of commodities, and overcome the phenomenon of roundabout transportation and facing-each-other transportation; we must correct the waste in the investment and use of capital construction, rationally allocate warehouses, stop all construction projects that can be postponed, and improve the efficiency of existing warehouses, dormitories, offices, oil tanks, dedicated lines, and freight yards. We must implement effective management of the national commercial network, stipulate the establishment and staffing quotas of enterprises and management departments, correct the phenomenon of arbitrarily increasing personnel and adding organizations, and abolish unnecessary organizations and some stores with too little sales volume. The grassroots units of the state-owned trading system should conduct appropriate division of labor with cooperatives, and entrust the purchasing work in rural areas and the sales work to farmers to cooperatives as much as possible, and actively help the development of cooperatives. We must severely punish corrupt and degenerate elements, resolutely oppose the theft of state property, and oppose trade administrative organs and trade enterprises operating so-called "organ production."
    In the production increase and thrift campaign, state-owned trading enterprises nationwide should systematically but actively gradually implement the economic accounting system, gradually deepen the work of fund verification to the most basic operating units, and gradually change the existing organizational form, distinguishing between enterprise management organs and enterprise institutions. Only by gradually but actively completing these fundamental reforms can state-owned trading enterprises embark on the track of economic accounting.
    The production increase and thrift campaign of state-owned trading enterprises should become a campaign to strengthen and improve national planning, and a campaign to strive to complete and exceed national plans. Only by strengthening and improving planning can we better meet the needs of consumers, and can we gradually achieve doing the most with the least amount of funds; and using the fewest personnel to maximize effectiveness. We must strengthen investigation and research work, and increasingly improve the accuracy of state-owned trade plans, and overcome the erroneous views of some personnel in trade administrative organs and state-owned trading enterprises who underestimate planning work.
    The production increase and thrift campaign of state-owned trading enterprises should become a broad, mass-based accounting campaign for all employees. We should strive to improve the class consciousness of all state-owned trade employees. Enlighten their patriotic enthusiasm and the consciousness of being the masters of the country, so that the production increase and thrift campaign becomes a vigorous mass-based patriotic movement. We should call on and organize all employees to consciously care about the economic accounting work of state-owned trading enterprises, mobilize all employees to explore the potential strength within the enterprise, absorb the wisdom of the broad masses of employees, and adopt all practical and feasible rationalization proposals and inventions. The manager of each state-owned trading enterprise unit should take practical responsibility for leading the production increase and thrift campaign, and the administrative负责人, the trade union负责人, specialized business cadres, and representatives of model workers should jointly organize a production increase and thrift campaign committee as the leading body of the production increase and thrift campaign to realize the democratization of internal enterprise management. This is a key to the success of this production increase and thrift campaign.
    The production increase and thrift campaign of state-owned trading enterprises should become a campaign to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet trade work. The management methods of Soviet trade enterprises are methods with a high degree of planning, organization, high work efficiency, and strict implementation of the economic accounting system, and therefore are the most economical methods. We must call on and organize all trade employees to work hard to learn the socialist trade enterprise management methods and apply them according to China's actual conditions, so as to achieve the goals of accelerating capital turnover, reducing commodity circulation costs, and gradually implementing the economic accounting system.
    The production increase and thrift campaign of state-owned trading enterprises should become a mass-based campaign to expose corrupt and degenerate elements and oppose waste. State-owned trading enterprises have developed vigorously in the past two years. Many old military and political organs personnel and old merchants have participated in the work. Although many of them have undergone education and transformation, there are still many who have not seriously transformed or have transformed very poorly, and they still inherit the corrupt style of the old society. At the same time, there are also some staff members who have participated in the revolution for a long time who have been affected by the bad habits of imperialists, feudal bureaucrats, Kuomintang reactionaries and old merchants and have degenerated. Because most of the personnel of state-owned trading enterprises directly and indirectly manage a part of state property, and because they are often in contact with domestic and foreign capitalist elements in their daily work, the elements with bad character are easily affected by capitalist ideology and embark on the path of degeneration and corruption. This shows that exposing corrupt and degenerate elements and opposing waste has its special importance in state-owned trading enterprises. We must take the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign as an integral and extremely important part of the national state-owned trading enterprise production increase and thrift campaign, so as to effectively achieve the task of accelerating capital turnover and reducing commodity circulation costs.
    In order to do a good job in the production increase and thrift work of state-owned trading enterprises and gradually implement the economic accounting system, we must resolutely overcome two erroneous ideas. One is the "supply system thinking" that is generally present in the cadres of state-owned trading enterprises; the other is the purely profit-seeking view of some staff members due to the influence of capitalist ideology. State-owned trading enterprises have gradually developed in the long revolutionary war. From the first day of its establishment, it has shouldered the responsibility of "guaranteeing supply" and "stabilizing prices." Trade administrative departments and enterprises at all levels have made great efforts to achieve these two tasks, which was absolutely necessary at that time. However, they have relaxed their efforts to improve the operation and management of the enterprise itself, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation costs. This has cultivated a set of supply system thinking and style for many cadres of state-owned trading enterprises. They ask their superiors for money when they have no money, and hand over the money to their superiors when they sell it. They do not understand the family background, do not calculate carefully, and attach importance to the "business" of "guaranteeing supply" and "stabilizing prices," and despise management work such as transportation, storage, accounting, and general affairs. In the past two years, this situation has improved, but it has not been completely overcome. This supply system thinking is the main ideological obstacle to the implementation of the economic accounting system in state-owned trading enterprises. Under the control of this thinking, many leaders of state-owned trading enterprises have become serious bureaucrats in operation and management. They are only satisfied with completing the task and not being corrupt themselves, and do not study how to improve operation and management. We must conduct a serious struggle against this supply system thinking and completely overcome this phenomenon. Otherwise, the production increase and thrift campaign cannot be successfully completed. At present, in state-owned trading enterprises, some staff members are affected by capitalist ideology and feudal old-fashioned commerce. They do not adopt the method of careful calculation to accelerate capital turnover and reduce commodity circulation costs to implement thrift and complete the state's financial tasks, but attempt to expand trade profits by raising selling prices and lowering purchasing prices. This erroneous practice, on the one hand, hinders the development of production undertakings, and on the other hand, increases the burden on consumers. This is the ideological source of the purely profit-seeking viewpoint of some personnel in state-owned trading enterprises. In order to carry out the production increase and thrift campaign, we must oppose and completely overcome the purely profit-seeking viewpoint, and correctly implement the state's trade policy and price policy.
    Party organizations at all levels and people's governments at all levels must attach importance to the production increase and thrift campaign of state-owned trading enterprises and provide practical leadership. There are a total of 10,000 state-owned trading enterprises across the country, distributed over vast areas of land. Only by relying on the strong leadership of local party and government organs can the production increase and thrift campaign be done well. The trade administrative departments of people's governments at all levels should not only become departments in charge of trade policies, but also should become the administrative management organs of all local state-owned trading enterprises, and should pay close attention to leading the operation and management of local state-owned trading enterprises, ensuring that they implement the instructions and decisions of their superiors to complete the task of increasing production and practicing thrift.

### 开展国营贸易系统的增产节约运动

    开展国营贸易系统的增产节约运动
    中央人民政府贸易部决定在全国国营贸易企业中开展增产节约运动，争取全国国营贸易企业在一九五二年中实现增产节约总值人民币十一万亿元。这对于全国国营贸易职工是一个重大的战斗的号召。
    两年来，全国国营贸易企业有了相当的发展，已成为国营经济中的一个重要力量。在中央人民政府和各级地方人民政府的正确领导下，国营贸易企业的全体职工一致努力，在实现物价稳定、扶植与发展生产、保证人民日用品供应和发展对外贸易等方面，曾有不少成绩。但国营贸易企业的经营管理工作，至今还有不少缺点，特别是资金周转太慢，商品流转费用过高，在机构设置、保管、运输等方面还有许多浪费现象。因此要实现国营贸易企业的增产节约计划，就必须加强经营管理工作，消灭浪费现象。
    在国营贸易企业中，开展增产节约运动的中心口号，就是“加速资金周转”，“减低商品流转费用”。在加速资金周转方面，要求实现一九五二年比一九五一年的资金周转率大大加快，节省资金应达人民币八万亿元，使国家能有更多的资金投入工业建设。在减低商品流转费用方面，要求一九五二年比一九五一年减低费用率百分之二点三三，节省商品流转费用应达人民币三万亿元，以增加国家的财政收入。为了实现这个目的，全国国营贸易企业必须继续认真地清理资产，核定资金，确定合理库存额，减少商品积压的现象。必须开展积极的销货运动，努力扩大卖钱额，克服保守惜售思想，改进对消费者的服务态度，改变目前某些企业中货物不合销路的现象；必须提高全体职工的劳动生产率，精简管理机构，充实基层单位，减少非直接业务人员，增加直接业务人员。加强国营贸易企业内部上下级之间、各个企业之间、各个工作部门之间的联系，加强国营贸易企业与其他国营企业及合作社企业的联系，逐步推行工作定额制度，订立企业行政与职工的集体合同及企业与企业之间、部门与部门之间的联系合同，规定各个企业各个部门的工作条例，规定各种不同工作人员的操作规程，根据各单位的计划订立个人工作计划；必须开展大规模的节约运动，减少业务费用，降低商品自然损耗，克服迂回运输，相向运输的现象；必须纠正在基本建设的投资及其使用中的浪费现象，合理分配仓库，停止一切可以缓办的工程建设，提高现有仓库、宿舍、办公室、油池、专用线和货场的使用效率。必须对全国的商业网实施有效的管理，规定企业和管理部门的编制和人员定额，纠正任意增加人员，增加机构的现象，并撤销不必要的机构和某些卖钱额过少的商店，应当使国营贸易系统的基层单位，和合作社进行适当的分工，把农村的收购工作，和向农民的销售工作，尽可能委托合作社办理，并积极帮助合作社的发展。必须严惩贪污蜕化分子，坚决反对盗窃国家财产的行为，并反对贸易行政机关和贸易企业经营所谓“机关生产”。
    全国国营贸易企业应当在增产节约运动中，有计划地但是积极地逐步实现经济核算制，逐步把资金核定的工作深入到最基层的经营单位，并逐渐改变现有的组织形式，分清企业管理机关和企业机构。 只有逐步地但是积极地完成这些根本的改革，国营贸易企业才能走上经济核算制的轨道。
    国营贸易企业的增产节约运动，应当成为一个加强和提高国家计划性的运动，成为一个争取完成与超过国家计划的运动。只有加强和提高计划性，才能更好地满足消费者的需要，才能逐渐作到用最少的资金，办最多的事情；使用最少的人员，发挥最大的效能。必须加强调查研究工作，日益增进国营贸易计划的准确性，克服贸易行政机关和国营贸易企业中某些人员轻视计划工作的错误观点。
    国营贸易企业的增产节约运动，应当成为一个全体职工的广泛的、群众性的核算运动。应当努力提高全体国营贸易职工的阶级觉悟。启发他们的爱国热情和国家主人翁的自觉，使增产节约运动成为一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的爱国运动。应当号召和组织全体职工自觉地关心国营贸易企业的经济核算工作，动员全体职工来发掘企业内部的潜在力量，吸收广大职工群众的智慧，采纳一切实际可行的合理化建议和发明创造。每个国营贸易企业单位的经理应切实负责领导增产节约运动，并由行政负责人、工会负责人、专门业务干部、模范工作者代表共同组织增产节约运动委员会，作为增产节约运动的领导机关，以实现企业内部管理民主化。这是这次增产节约运动能否成功的一个关键。
    国营贸易企业的增产节约运动，应当成为一个学习苏联贸易工作的先进经验的运动。苏联贸易企业的管理方法，是具有高度的计划性、组织性，具有高度的工作效率，并严格实行经济核算制的方法，因而也就是最节约的方法。必须号召和组织全体贸易职工努力学习社会主义的贸易企业管理方法，并按照我国的实际情况加以运用，才能达到加速资金周转，减低商品流转费用，和逐步实现经济核算制的目的。
    国营贸易企业的增产节约运动，应当成为一个群众性的检举贪污蜕化分子，反对浪费的运动。国营贸易企业是在最近两年中蓬勃发展起来的，有许多旧的军政机关人员和旧商人参加了工作。其中虽然有不少人已经经过了教育改造，但是还有很多人没有认真改造或改造得很差，他们还承袭着旧社会贪污腐化的作风。同时也还有一些参加革命较久的工作人员，受了帝国主义者、封建官僚、国民党反动派和旧商人的恶习的沾染而堕落蜕化。由于国营贸易企业的大多数人员，都直接、间接地经理着一部分国家财产，由于他们每天在工作中经常与国内外的资本主义成份相接触，因而其中品质恶劣的分子，很容易遭受资本主义思想的影响，走上堕落腐化的道路。这就说明了检举贪污蜕化分子，反对浪费，在国营贸易企业中有其特殊的重要性。必须把反贪污浪费的运动，作为全国国营贸易企业增产节约运动的一个不可分割的、而且是极为重要的部分，才能有效地实现加速资金周转与减低商品流转费用的任务。
    为了作好国营贸易企业的增产节约工作，逐步实现经济核算制，必须坚决克服两种错误思想。一种是普遍存在于国营贸易企业干部中的“供给制思想”；一种是某些工作人员由于受了资本主义思想影响而产生的单纯营利观点。国营贸易企业是在长期的革命战争中逐步发展起来的。它从成立的第一天起，就肩负了“保证供应”与“稳定物价”的责任。各级贸易行政部门与企业，为了实现这两个任务，进行了巨大的努力，这在当时是完全必要的。但是，他们却放松了对于改进企业本身的经营管理工作、加速资金周转、降低流转费用的努力。这就养成了许多国营贸易企业干部的一套供给制的思想与作风。他们没有钱时向上级要，卖了钱时向上级交，不了解家底，不精打细算，重视“保证供应”与“稳定物价”的“业务”，轻视运输、保管、会计、总务等管理工作。近两年来，这种情况虽然有了改善，但还没有彻底克服。这种供给制思想，是在国营贸易企业中实行经济核算制的主要思想障碍。在这种思想支配下，有许多国营贸易企业的领导人，在经营管理工作上，成为严重的官僚主义者。他们仅仅以完成了任务和自己并没有贪污腐化为满足，而不去研究如何改进经营管理工作。必须对这种供给制思想进行严肃的斗争，彻底克服这种现象。否则，增产节约运动是不能胜利完成的。在目前国营贸易企业中，还有一部分工作人员，受了资本主义思想和封建性的旧式商业的影响，他们不采取加速资金周转、减低商品流转费用的精打细算的方法来实行节约，完成国家的财政任务，而企图用提高出售价、降低收购价的方法来扩大贸易利润。这种错误作法，一方面妨碍了生产事业的发展，另一方面加重了消费者的负担。这就是国营贸易企业中的某些人员的单纯营利观点的思想根源。为了开展增产节约运动，就必须反对和彻底克服单纯营利观点，正确地执行国家的贸易政策与价格政策。
    各级党组织，各级人民政府，都必须重视国营贸易企业的增产节约运动，并加以切实的领导。全国国营贸易企业共有一万个单位，分布在辽阔的土地上，只有依靠当地党政机关的坚强领导，才有可能把增产节约运动做好。各级人民政府的贸易行政部门应当不仅成为主管贸易政策的部门，而且应当成为当地一切国营贸易企业的行政管理机关，应当十分注意领导当地国营贸易企业的经营管理工作，保证他们实现上级的指示和决定，来完成增产节约的任务。
