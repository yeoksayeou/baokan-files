(Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 8th) According to TASS, Tehran, 7th: In the past few days, student organizations of Tehran University and middle schools have distributed many leaflets, calling on students to hold demonstrations and assemblies in Baharestan Square in front of the lower house on the 6th, demanding the release of students arrested not long ago for "political reasons," and demanding that university and middle school students who were expelled for engaging in progressive activities be allowed to return to school.

On the morning of the 6th, several large teams of police and troops occupied the streets and houses near Tehran University and set up cordons around the area. All traffic between Tehran University and the city center was cut off.

Despite this, many university and middle school students still gathered in other areas in the morning, and then marched in lines through the streets toward the lower house.

Demonstrators often clashed with police when gathering and advancing. The police used batons, sabers, bayonets, and sometimes even opened fire. They were also aided by many plainclothes agents carrying knives and batons.

The demonstrators repelled the attacks of the police and thugs with stones, and seized their batons in the struggle.

Although the police tried to disperse the demonstrators, several thousand demonstrators still reached Baharestan Square. There, the police used tear gas and grenades against the demonstrators. Some demonstrators were injured by bayonets, knives, and gunfire.

On the same day, the police and thugs also destroyed the Sadi Theater, broke into the "Peace Palace" in Tehran, destroyed all the furniture there, and set fire to the library, reading room, and office of the Iranian Peace Committee located there. They also destroyed the editorial offices of two progressive newspapers.

    要求释放无辜被捕学生
    德黑兰学生集会示威
    反动警察竟使用武力杀伤示威者
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰七日讯：在过去数天中，德黑兰大学和中学的学生组织散发了许多传单，号召学生们六日在下院前面的巴哈里斯坦广场举行示威和集会，要求释放不久前因“政治理由”被捕的学生，并要求允许因为从事进步活动而被开除的大学生和中学生复学。
    六日早晨，几大队警察和军队占据了德黑兰大学附近的街道和房屋，并在这个地区的四周布置警戒线。德黑兰大学和市中心之间的所有交通，都被断绝。
    尽管如此，许多大学生和中学生早晨仍在其他地区集合，然后排队走过大街向下院前进。
    示威者在集合和前进时，和警察时常发生冲突。警察使用了短棍、佩刀、刺刀、有时还开枪。他们并有许多带着小刀和短棍的便衣队的帮助。
    示威者用石子击退了警察和暴徒的进攻，并且在搏斗中夺下了他们的短棍。
    虽然警察想驱散示威者，但几千个示威者仍然到达了巴哈里斯坦广场。警察在那里用催泪瓦斯和手榴弹对付示威者。有些示威者被刺刀、小刀和枪打伤。
    同日，警察和暴徒并捣毁了萨地戏院，冲进了德黑兰的“和平宫”，捣毁了那里的全部家具，放火焚烧设在那里的伊朗和平委员会的图书馆、阅览室和办公室。他们并捣毁了两家进步报纸的编辑部。
