“My Transformation”
Catholic  Li Zilin

I am from Damingfu. My family is poor peasant. My grandfather, father, and I, three generations, have all been Catholics. Before liberation in my hometown, I often heard foreign priests spreading rumors about the Communist Party, so I was very afraid of the Communist Party. After Daming was liberated, I was unwilling to take the lead in anything. During land reform, when people struggled against landlords, I tried to avoid going. When distributing the fruits of victory, I dared not say I wanted them, nor did I dare say I didn't want them; I just took whatever people gave me.

Last August 15th, I went to Tianjin's Jingu University to work as a handyman. When I first arrived, the foreign priests were very polite to me. I thought, "This is not bad, aren't they very amiable?" The French priest, Chai Guzhi, instructed me, "Never get close to Communist Party members or Communist Youth League members, or you will go to hell." I listened to his words, and whenever I saw students, I tried to avoid them; when cleaning the students' rooms, I only cleaned the rooms when I saw that no one was inside. Later, I was assigned to the first dormitory, where Comrade Wei Li (the person in charge of the CCP branch) happened to live. I thought: Oh no! I tried to avoid it, but I still ran into this "leader"! When sweeping the floor, I would secretly check if he was in the room first, and if he was, I would wait until he fell asleep before sweeping, for fear that he would talk to me about problems. Sometimes when people called me Comrade Li, my heart would pound.

Last December, when the teachers and students in the school were carrying out school administration reform, I thought: It's over! They will first drive away the foreign priests, and then drive away the Catholics. My job won't last long, so I can only listen to God's will! Later, someone introduced me to join the "Legion of Mary." I thought that since it had the name of the Holy Mother, it must be administering sacraments, and since I was a devout Catholic, I joined. Every time I went to listen to lectures, the foreign priests would light candles and preach, and after explaining the doctrine, they would blow out the candles and tell us things like, "The Communist Party is the devil, never get close to them." "Don't read Communist Party newspapers and books." After the innovation movement started, they also said: Signing is "apostasy." When the Innovation Promotion Association called for signatures, I always avoided signing. Once, the school held a large dinner party and asked the workers to participate. I thought: What trick is this again? Is it to trick us into signing? Not only did I not go myself, but I also told other workers not to go. At the time, I still thought I was very clever!

But I slowly began to have doubts. I saw that the foreign priests, like Fang Ruhui, ate with us on the surface, but secretly bought bread to eat after returning to their rooms. I thought: Aren't they deceiving people? At this time, I began to think about what they said and sometimes look at the facts. For example, they said that the Communist Party was the "devil," but I saw that the Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members all had good grades, obeyed the rules, and took great care of every plant and tree in the school. I thought: There is not a single thing about the Party and League members that resembles a "devil"! What moved me the most was that after liberation, prices stabilized, and my personal life improved. I saw many facts with my own eyes: like a river near my hometown that used to flood every year, after liberation, the people's government took early precautions every year. Take Tianjin as an example: the roads were repaired, the dirty mud roads of Qian De Zhuang were gone, there were no more thieves, and unemployed workers had jobs to do... I also thought of the government's efforts to control the Huai River, build railways... China has never had such a good government! Didn't the Bible say: It's not those who say "Lord! Lord!" who can ascend to heaven, but those who do good things who can ascend to heaven? The Communist Party has done so many good things, why does Catholicism always oppose them?

At this time, American spies and Catholic priests Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, Fang Ruhui, etc., were arrested by the Public Security Bureau. Their criminal evidence was announced: setting up radio stations, building secret rooms, organizing the "Legion of Mary," distributing reactionary leaflets, spreading rumors, sabotaging the innovation movement... one by one, with witnesses and material evidence, it was all true. I was both surprised and afraid at the time. What was strange was: why were these "priests" doing these things? Weren't they here to preach? What I was afraid of was: I also joined the "Legion of Mary," and people would surely treat me as a special agent. I felt ashamed to be a Catholic; I put the holy medal behind my neck and dared not show it anymore. But later, when the school's faculty and staff held meetings, no one looked down on us; everyone said that we had been deceived. Dean Wang even called on us to recognize the faces of the imperialist elements, unite with non-Catholics, and fight against imperialism. Then the student union called on us to see the Public Security Exhibition. I lined up with the students for the first time. I began to feel that Catholics and non-Catholics were not far apart; it was the foreign priests who had separated us in the past. At the exhibition, the evidence of imperialism using religion to invade China was displayed. I also thought of Fang Ruhui and others throwing the crucifix under the bed and putting erotic pictures on the table... I began to understand that the foreign priests were not here to preach, but to bully us Chinese, to prevent us from loving our country, and to make us live the hard life we had before. In the past, they nodded to us when they saw us and ate with us, but it turned out they were trying to deceive us. I began to move from doubting them to hating them.

But there was still a contradiction in my heart: China is becoming stronger day by day, and I am very happy; but if the country becomes strong, can Catholicism still exist? I really couldn't figure it out. Later, after talking with Comrade Wei Li, I understood. Comrade Wei Li told me: Loving the country and loving the church are not contradictory; a good Catholic should first love their own country, and participating in the innovation movement is precisely for the sake of loving the church. He also explained to me the people's government's policy of guaranteeing freedom of religious belief. I recognized the truth that Catholicism must be reformed, so I actively participated in the innovation movement. In addition to signing the innovation declaration, I also often explained the principles of innovation to others. I participated in every meeting discussing the innovation movement. When the "Legion of Mary" was banned, I was the first to withdraw from this reactionary organization. At the Catholic study meeting, I took the lead in speaking, exposing the crimes of the "Legion of Mary." I participated in every political class. Recently, I scored 95 on the political test.

Looking back now, the innovation movement has completely changed me. What I thought was good in the past, I now know is bad; what I thought was bad in the past, I now know is lovable. In the past, when someone cursed imperialism, I thought they were cursing God; now I can distinguish what imperialism is and what freedom of religious belief is. (Xinhua News Agency)

### “我的转变”

    “我的转变”
    天主教徒  李梓林
    我是大名府人。家里是贫农。祖父、父亲和我三辈都信天主教。我们家乡没解放的时候，我常听外国神甫们关于共产党的造谣，所以我非常害怕共产党。大名解放后，我事事不愿出头。土地改革时，人家斗争地主，我想法躲着不去。分胜利果实，我不敢说要，也不敢说不要，人家给啥就算啥。
    去年八月十五日，我到天津津沽大学当工友。刚来时，外国神甫们见了我很客气。我想：“这倒不错，人家不是很和气吗？”法国神甫柴古值嘱咐我说：“千万别跟共产党员、青年团员接近，不然就要下地狱。”我听了他的话，一见到同学们就想法躲开；给同学们扫屋子时，我看那屋里没人才扫那屋。后来，我被分配到第一宿舍，恰巧韦力同志
    （中共支部负责人）在那里住。我想：糟啦！紧躲慢躲，又碰上这个“头儿”啦！扫地的时候，我先偷偷地看看他在屋里没有，要是在屋里我就等他睡着了再扫，只怕他给我谈问题。有时人家叫我一声李同志，我的心就扑通扑通乱跳。
    去年十二月，学校里先生和学生们搞校政改革时，我想：完啦！他们先把外国神甫们赶走，接着就赶教徒了。我的事干不长了，只好听天主的意思吧！后来，有人介绍我参加“圣母军”。我想既有圣母的名字，一定是办圣事，我又是个热心的教友，便参加了。每次去听讲，外国神甫们点着蜡烛就传教，讲完了道理，把蜡烛一吹，就给我们讲“共产党是魔鬼，千万别跟他们接近。”“不要看共产党的书报。”这一类的话。革新运动开始后，他们又说：签名就是“背教”。革新促进会号召签名时，我总是躲着不签。有一次学校里举行大聚餐，叫工友们参加。我想：又是什么花招儿，别是骗我们去签名吧！我不但自己没去，还告诉别的工友也不要去。当时我还觉得我很聪明呢！
    但是我慢慢地开始怀疑了。我看到外国神甫房如晦他们表面上和我们在一起吃饭，回去后却又偷偷地买面包吃。我想：他们这不是骗人吗？这时对他们说的话开始想一想了，有时要看看事实。比如他们说共产党是“魔鬼”，可是我看到共产党员、青年团员们个个功课好，又守规矩，对学校的一草一木都非常爱护。我想：党、团员们没有一个地方像“魔鬼”呀！最使我感动的是解放后物价平稳了，我个人的生活也好了。我亲眼看见许多事实：像我们家乡附近一条河过去年年泛水，解放后人民政府每年都早早防范好了。拿天津来说：马路修好了，谦德庄的脏泥道没有了，小偷没有了，失业工人有活干了……。我又联想到政府治淮河、修铁路……。中国历来那有这么个好政府呀！圣经上不是说过：不是“主啊！主啊”的才能升天堂，而要把事办好才能升天堂吗？共产党办了这么多好事，为什么天主教总是反对人家呢？
    这时候美国间谍、天主教神甫卜相贤、鲍翊华、房如晦等被公安局逮捕了。他们的罪证公布了：安电台、设密室、组织“圣母军”，散发反动传单、造谣、破坏革新运动……一件一件，人证物证，确确实实。我当时又奇怪又害怕，奇怪的是：这些“神长”们怎么净干这些事呢？他们不是来传教吗？害怕的是：我也参加了“圣母军”，人家一定拿我当特务办。我觉着做一个天主教徒很丢人；把圣牌放在脖子后头，不敢再露出来了。可是后来学校教职员们开会，没有一个人看不起我们，大家都说我们是受骗的。王教务长还号召我们认清帝国主义分子的面目，和非教徒团结起来，和帝国主义作斗争。接着学生会又号召我们去看公安展览。我头一次跟同学们一块排队。我开始觉着教徒和非教徒离着并不远，过去是叫外国神甫把我们隔开了。在展览会上，陈列着帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国的罪证。我又联想到房如晦他们把十字架扔在床底下，把春宫画放在桌子上……。我开始明白，外国神甫不是来传教，是来欺负我们中国人，不叫我们爱国，还叫我们过以前的苦日子。他们过去见了我们点点头，跟我们在一起吃饭，原来是想欺骗我们。我开始由怀疑他们到仇恨他们。
    可是我的心里还是有矛盾：中国一天天的富强，我很高兴；但国家强了，天主教是不是还能存在呢？我实在想不通。后来，找韦力同志一谈才明白了。韦力同志告诉我：爱国和爱教并不矛盾，一个善良的教徒应当首先爱自己的国家，参加革新运动正是为了爱教。他又给我解释了人民政府保障宗教信仰自由的政策。我认清了天主教必须革新的道理，便积极参加革新运动。除了在革新宣言上签名以外，还常常给别人讲革新的道理。每次开会讨论革新运动时我都参加。在取缔“圣母军”时，我首先退出这个反动组织。在教友学习会上，我带头发言，揭露“圣母军”的罪行。每次上政治课我都参加。最近政治测验，我考了九十五分。
    现在想起来，革新运动使我整个变了样。过去我认为好的，现在知道它是坏的了；过去我认为坏的，现在知道它是可爱的了。过去有人骂帝国主义，我认为是骂天主；现在我分清了什么是帝国主义，什么叫宗教信仰自由了。（新华社）
