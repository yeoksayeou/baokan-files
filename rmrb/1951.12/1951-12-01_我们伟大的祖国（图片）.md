    Our Great Motherland
    The cultural and educational undertakings in the minority areas of our country are currently being vigorously restored and developed. On the Inner Mongolian grasslands, where there were no schools before, a complete primary school with more than 200 students has now been established, giving the children of fraternal nationalities the opportunity to enjoy education. This is the Xilingol Complete Primary School in Beizi Temple, Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Many herdsmen's children come here to study.

    我们伟大的祖国
    我国少数民族地区的文化教育事业，目前正在努力恢复和发展中。在内蒙草原上，以前没有学校，现在却建立了有二百多学生的完全小学，使得兄弟民族人民的子弟有享受教育的机会。这是内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟贝子庙的锡林郭勒完全小学。许多牧民的子弟都到这里来上学。
