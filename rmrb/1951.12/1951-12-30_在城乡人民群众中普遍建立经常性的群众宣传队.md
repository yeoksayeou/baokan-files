    Universally Establish Regular Mass Propaganda Teams Among Urban and Rural People

    It has been a year since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the decision to establish a propaganda network. With the establishment of the Party's propaganda network among the people, the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has already had a basic force. The Party's propagandists and the broad masses of propaganda activists, working together, have launched tremendous activities in the past year, initially realizing Chairman Mao's call in February to ensure that every place and every person in the country receives patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Facts have proven that the coordinated actions of the Party's propagandists and the broad masses of propaganda teams are a guarantee for making the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea truly universal, profound, and regular. Therefore, universally establishing regular mass propaganda teams in cities and villages plays an important role in continuing to strengthen patriotic education among the people.

    Some people say, "Now that we already have Communist Party propagandists, why do we need mass propaganda teams?" Indeed, the Communist Party of China now has more than 1.92 million propagandists nationwide, which is a considerable propaganda force. However, our country is a large country with a population of 475 million. Relying only on the strength of the Party's propagandists, without relying on the mass propaganda teams, is obviously not enough. To make mass propaganda work truly universal and in-depth, regular mass propaganda teams should also be established in the vast cities and villages under the leadership of the Party's propagandists. Some places have done this in the past. For example, Beijing and Daming County in Hebei Province organized activists from various struggles into regular mass propaganda teams to carry out planned and led propaganda activities. As a result, mass propaganda work can be carried out regularly. However, many places have not done this until now, which is an important reason why our propaganda work is sometimes tight and sometimes loose and cannot universally reach every corner.

    The Party's propagandists and the members of the mass propaganda teams should be the backbone force in various mass propaganda organizations. If general mass propaganda organizations do not have the leadership and assistance of organized propagandists and propaganda team members, it will be difficult to regularize mass propaganda work. Propagandists and propaganda team members should actively participate in the activities of various mass propaganda organizations such as reading groups, blackboard newspapers, broadcasting stations, amateur theater groups, and literacy classes. With regular leadership, various mass propaganda organizations can regularize mass propaganda work, avoid waste of manpower, avoid chaotic steps, and be able to carry out propaganda in a planned and coordinated manner around a central purpose.

    From this, it can be seen that earnestly establishing mass propaganda teams among the urban and rural people can give the Party's propaganda network a broader mass base, thereby truly forming a propaganda army from top to bottom with leadership and backbone forces, creating good conditions for the regularization of mass propaganda work.

    在城乡人民群众中普遍建立经常性的群众宣传队
    中共中央发布建立宣传网的决定，到现在是一周年了。随着党对人民群众的宣传网的建立，抗美援朝的宣传教育运动已经有了一支基本队伍。党的宣传员和广大的群众宣传积极分子在一起，在过去一年中展开了巨大的活动，初步实现了毛主席在二月间提出的使全国每处每人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育的号召。事实证明：党的宣传员队伍和广大的群众宣传队伍的配合行动，是使抗美援朝爱国教育真正做到普遍、深入和经常化的保证。因此，在城市和乡村中，普遍建立起经常性的群众宣传队，对于在人民群众中继续加强爱国主义教育，有着重要的作用。
    有人说：“既然已经有了共产党的宣传员，何必还要群众宣传队呢？”不错，现在中国共产党在全国已经拥有宣传员一百九十二万余人，这的确是一支相当强大的宣传力量。但是，我们的国家是一个有四亿七千五百万人口的大国，只有党的宣传员的力量，而不依靠群众宣传队的队伍，显然还是不够的。要使群众宣传工作真正做到普遍和深入，还应该在党的宣传员的领导之下，在广大城市和乡村建立起经常性的群众宣传队。过去有的地方是这样作了，例如北京市和河北省大名县，把各种斗争中的积极分子组织起来，组成经常性的群众宣传队，进行有计划有领导的宣传活动，结果群众宣传工作就能经常进行。但是有许多地方直到现在还没有这样做，这就是我们宣传工作时紧时松和不能普遍地达到每一个角落的重要原因。
    党的宣传员和群众宣传队的队员，应该是各种群众宣传组织中的骨干力量。一般的群众宣传组织，如果没有有组织的宣传员和宣传队员的领导和帮助，要使群众宣传工作经常化是会有困难的。宣传员和宣传队员应该积极地参加读报组、黑板报、广播筒、业余剧团、识字班等各种群众宣传组织的活动。各种群众宣传组织有了经常的领导，就可以使群众宣传工作经常起来，并能避免人力上的浪费，避免步骤混乱，能够围绕着一个中心目的，有计划地有配合地进行宣传。
    由此可见，认真地在城市和乡村人民群众中建立群众宣传队，可以使党的宣传网的工作有更加广泛的群众基础，从而真正形成一支从上到下的有领导的有骨干力量的宣传大军，为群众宣传工作的经常化创造良好的条件。
