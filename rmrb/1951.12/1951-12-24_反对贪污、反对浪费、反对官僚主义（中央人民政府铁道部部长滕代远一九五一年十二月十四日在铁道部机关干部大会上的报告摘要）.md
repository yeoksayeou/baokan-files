Comrades:

    Today I want to report on the issue of how to launch the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism.

    Since the takeover, the railway has rapidly completed the restoration tasks given by the state, and has also achieved significant achievements and gained some experience in management and new construction projects. Especially this year, after the three major movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, our work has made even greater progress. However, it must be pointed out that we still have many shortcomings, serious corruption and waste, and serious bureaucratism.

    Before we entered the big cities, Chairman Mao pointed out that we must prevent the influence of the old society and capitalist ideology from eroding us and our party after the victory of the revolution on a national scale; after the victory of the revolution, some people would develop pride and a reluctance to make progress, and under the influence of bourgeois ideology, hedonistic ideas would grow, and we must be seriously vigilant against this enemy who does not carry guns but holds sugar-coated bullets to attack us. However, this important instruction has not attracted enough attention from us. In addition, after liberation, we took over a large number of original organizations and original personnel. Although we have carried out several movements to reform institutions and transform ideology, the situation has greatly improved, but in the two years and eight months since then, we have not carried out a systematic, widespread, in-depth, and mass anti-corruption and anti-waste movement. According to existing materials, the phenomenon of corruption and waste within the railway system is indeed widespread and serious, and it is worthy of great vigilance.

    In our railways, it can be affirmed that the vast majority of veteran cadres have always followed Chairman Mao's instructions, being modest and prudent, not arrogant or impetuous, maintaining a hardworking style, and working wholeheartedly. A large part of the old personnel have also gradually been transformed to varying degrees. However, there are also some veteran cadres who have embarked on the shameful path of depravity and degeneration due to the temptation of urban material life and the attack of capitalist ideology, and even become criminals who steal state property. Many of the bad habits of corruption and waste of the old personnel have not been eradicated.

    Resolutely rely on the masses, launch a vigorous,
    and swift struggle against corruption,
        waste, and bureaucratism.

    The fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism not only has its economic significance but also has significant political significance. Counter-revolutionaries use armed forces and persecution methods to attack us from the outside, which is something everyone understands, but using the extremely harmful influence of the old society and capitalist ideology to erode us can easily make us relax our vigilance. In letters to Chairman Mao, the masses said: One cadre's corruption is something our people cannot earn back in several lifetimes. If we spend money to buy airplanes and cannons to resist US aggression and aid Korea, we have nothing to say; but if cadres are allowed to be corrupt and wasteful, it pains us very much.

    Now is a critical moment for us to implement Chairman Mao's instructions. In order to run our enterprises well, and in order to better prepare to welcome the national construction cause, we must expose and crack down on corruption, waste, and bureaucratism without mercy, and deeply launch a systematic, comprehensive, and led mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism.

    What is corruption?

    All public money, property, etc., that should not be obtained by oneself but is seized for personal possession, as well as shameful acts such as embezzlement, theft, extortion, and bribery by taking advantage of one's position, are all corruption.

    In our railway system, this kind of corruption is very easy to occur. For example, leaking news to merchants before the freight rate is announced and implemented; or leaking news about our pre-purchased materials and contracted projects to merchants, so that merchants can speculate and raise market prices, and individuals receive rewards and bribes from them. Procurement personnel collude with private merchants, take kickbacks, write false receipts, directly accept bribes, accept gifts from private merchants, or collude with merchants to raise market prices and share profits, use public funds, or use public names to purchase materials at low prices and sell them at high prices for public use. Various custodians use public property for private purposes and steal and sell property. All kinds of people who handle funds embezzle deposit interest. Transportation personnel borrow money from merchants and freight yards without repaying it, and accept gifts and bribes. Baggage handlers steal passenger goods and luggage in baggage cars. Ticket sellers, ticket inspectors, and financial inspectors embezzle ticket money. Many ordinary personnel falsely report travel expenses and various expense reimbursements. The railway public security department confiscates contraband without handing it over to the state treasury, treats it as the property of the unit, and even sells it or seizes it for its own use. In construction projects and construction departments, contact with private merchants, corruption, and degeneration, and so on. Most of the above-mentioned methods of corruption will exist on the railway.

    What is waste?

    Waste in the railway system, from a general point of view, can be divided into the following four categories: (1) Waste in capital construction. Including design and planning are not careful; construction is carried out without design; design and construction are carried out simultaneously; rework and work stoppage; resulting in waste. According to the preliminary inspection of the Southwest Engineering Bureau, nine engineering sections and two engineering teams wasted a total of 8.9888 billion yuan. Most of these wastes are caused by carelessness, irresponsibility, excessive use of explosives, poor design, line changes, poor quality, and foundation subsidence. In addition to the Southwest Engineering Bureau continuing to conduct in-depth inspections, each bureau should also extensively launch democratic inspections. (2) Waste in operation and management. Such as stockpiling materials, stockpiling funds, unreasonable organization, too many upper-level institutions and office staff, resulting in waste of manpower and time. For example, from January to November this year, the Ministry of Railways' office staff traveled on business a cumulative total of 5,175 people, totaling 57,008 days, an average of 11 days per person, totaling 342,051,101 yuan in travel expenses. Of course, in order to go deep into the lower levels and understand the work, business trips are necessary, but some business trips are unplanned, aimlessly going around, and there is a lot of waste. (3) Waste in meetings, receptions, and supply of office work. The original budget for the June National Railway Bureau Directors Conference was 4 million yuan, but the actual expenditure was more than 29.2 million yuan. The original budget for the National Railway Labor Model Representatives Conference was 850 million yuan, and the additional budget was more than 540 million yuan. The original budget for the National Railway Exhibition was 300 million yuan, and the actual expenditure was 650 million yuan. Although the meeting was very good, although the additional budget had reasons for postponement, a strict inspection still reveals waste. From January to November, the Ministry of Railways held a total of 37 professional meetings and small meetings, with a total of 2,736 participants. The time was a total of 388 days, with a total expenditure of 164,739,640 yuan. For the sake of work, it is of course necessary to hold meetings, and the meetings have also solved a lot of work problems, but due to poor planning and insufficient preparation, the waste of time is not small. According to the inspection, some meetings have occurred where meeting fees were used for meals and entertainment. (4) Waste in life. Some people, under the pretext of work relations, spend money recklessly, which must be checked and corrected. In particular, serious cases of corruption and degeneration have been found among our dispatched personnel. A certain surveying team in western Hunan has had similar things happen, and these need to be checked.

    In the process, several incorrect
        understandings should be corrected:

    1. Some people say: There is nothing in the office, or that there is nothing in my department. We must oppose this argument. Corruption and waste may be less in the office, but not necessarily. The material, livelihood, general affairs, and transportation departments, those who directly control the purchase and custody of money and property, may have more.

    2. Some people say: Only staffing is important in the office. If it can be properly resolved, it can greatly improve work efficiency. We believe that the staffing of the office, especially the staffing problem of the Ministry of Railways' office today, is indeed an important issue. But we cannot say that only staffing is important in the office because of this. In terms of economic significance, the average annual cost of each staff member of the Ministry of Railways' office, including wages, office expenses, and miscellaneous expenses, is 9.8 million yuan. If we reduce 700 people, we can save more than 6.8 billion yuan in expenses each year. But can we say that we will not find such a large amount of corruption in our office? If we add the losses in work and economy caused by waste and bureaucratic work style, we can be sure that it is much larger than this number, let alone the political losses.

    3. Some people say: Corruption is because life is hard. Who would be corrupt if life were not hard? This is a more popular saying. We think this is also wrong, and it does not conform to the facts. We can ask, among the corrupt elements, how many are really trying to support their families and solve family difficulties? And does it mean that because there are difficulties at home, one can be corrupt according to the needs of the difficulties? In fact, we rarely find cases of corruption to solve livelihood difficulties. Moreover, the lives of our railway workers are gradually improving compared to the past. The vast majority of corrupt elements like to squander, degenerate, and degenerate for personal freedom and enjoyment. It is a fact that the current low-salary system makes life relatively difficult, but it cannot be used as an excuse to protect corrupt elements.

    4. Some people say: Increasing production is positive, and saving is negative. This statement is also wrong. We say that both increasing production and saving are positive. The Soviet Union regards saving as a method of socialist capital accumulation. Many people also say that this is called spilling sesame oil from a big basket and picking sesame seeds everywhere. We say that this is called not allowing sesame oil to be spilled from a big basket, and also picking sesame seeds everywhere. Of course, our fight against corruption and waste today is not a matter of picking sesame seeds. In fact, everyone can see the situation of corruption and waste everywhere today, and they can know that this cannot be a problem that should be treated passively.

    5. Some people also say: One movement after another, it never ends, and it gets bigger and bigger. It seems a little tired of the movement. The old China of thousands of years has left behind many bad habits, which must be gradually eliminated. The ideological understanding of each person must be transformed, and the movements must come one after another. And the more you do it, the greater the power. We must face this law of development squarely. Just like we have to get up, sleep, eat, and dress every day. Why should we feel tired?

    Another opinion is that there is a mentality of getting through the checkpoint. It must be understood that this is not getting through the public checkpoint, but getting through one's own checkpoint. If you really want to improve yourself and remove your problems, you must honestly get through every checkpoint that must be passed.

    In order to do this work well, we must implement the principle of the head taking responsibility, personally taking action, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses. We must ensure that the head takes the lead, carries out criticism and self-criticism, greatly promotes democracy, supports the masses, and promotes the hardworking style. Strengthen and improve the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of employees in protecting state property, so that everyone despises the corrupt, wasteful, and decadent behavior.

    The handling policy should be based on the spirit of the central instructions, and adopt the policy of combining punishment and education. According to the severity of the circumstances, give criticism, education, and administrative and criminal sanctions, and even the most severe sanctions. Good things should be praised. The exposure and reporting from below should be combined with the inspection from above. Opinion boxes should be set up, and anonymous letters of accusation can be sent. No matter inside or outside the office, accusations can be made at any time. If anyone restricts others' opinions or threatens others to make suggestions, they will be severely punished once discovered or reported.

    Combine voluntary confession with others' reporting. Those who voluntarily confess will have their punishments reduced according to the circumstances, the heavy will be lightened, and the light will be exempted; those who are reported by others will have their punishments increased according to the circumstances; and those who resist will be severely punished.

    Anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucratism must be carried out in close combination. Where corruption and waste are serious, the bureaucratic work style of the leadership is also serious. Therefore, this movement must achieve the purpose of eliminating corruption and waste and improving work, so as to open up a good road for increasing production and saving in the future.

    In order to deeply develop this movement, we have decided to establish an office's Production Increase and Saving Committee and set up an office to lead this work. Each bureau and department will establish a branch, and units below the bureau and department will establish a group. Each bureau's and department's affiliated enterprises in Beijing will establish a branch, and all directly affiliated agencies outside the Beijing area will be led by the local authorities and establish an inspection team to focus on assisting.

    Each unit also needs to make detailed plans and steps for implementation. Regarding the time issue, we have decided to continue until it is thorough and complete. Now we can tentatively set a one-month plan.

    反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义
    （中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远一九五一年十二月十四日在铁道部机关干部大会上的报告摘要）同志们：
    今天我所要报告的是如何开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的问题。
    铁路自从接管以来，迅速地完成了国家所给予的修复任务，同时在管理上以及新建工程中已经获得了重大的成就，并取得了一些经验。特别是今年经过了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动以来，我们的工作更加有了进步。但是必须指出，我们也还存在着许多缺点，存在着严重的贪污浪费现象和严重的官僚主义现象。
    在我们未进入大城市之前，毛主席就指出过，必须防止革命在全国范围胜利之后，旧社会的影响和资本主义思想侵蚀我们，侵蚀我们的党；革命胜利之后，有一部分人会产生骄傲和不求进步的情绪，又受着资产阶级思想的影响，就滋长了个人享乐主义思想，必须严重的警惕这种不拿枪的而是拿着裹着糖衣炮弹的敌人对我们的攻击。但是这一重要指示，却未引起我们足够的注意。加上解放以后，接收原有机构及原有人员为数甚大，虽然进行了历次改革机构和改造思想的运动，情况有了很大的改进，但两年零八个月以来，我们还未进行过有系统的普遍深入的群众性的反贪污反浪费运动。根据已有的材料看来，铁路系统内部贪污浪费现象确是普遍的严重的，十分值得警惕。
    在我们铁路上，可以肯定，绝大部分老干部一直是遵照毛主席的指示，谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁，保持着艰苦奋斗的作风，全心全意地努力工作着。旧有人员，也有很大部分已经逐渐得到程度不同的改造。但也有一部分老干部，由于城市物质生活的引诱和资本主义思想的袭击，而走上了堕落、蜕化的可耻道路，甚至于成为盗窃国家资财的罪犯。不少的旧有人员过去贪污浪费的恶劣作风仍未革除。
    坚决依靠群众，大张旗鼓地、
    雷厉风行地展开反贪污、反
        浪费、反官僚主义斗争。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义不仅有其经济上的意义，而且有重大的政治意义。反革命用武装以及迫害的方法，从外部进攻我们，这是人人了解的事情，但是用极其有害的旧社会影响和资本主义思想侵蚀我们，就容易使我们放松警惕心。群众给毛主席的信，有的这样说：一个干部贪污了一次，我们老百姓几辈子都赚不回来，如果为抗美援朝买飞机大炮，花多少钱都是应该的，我们没有话说；让干部贪污浪费了，我们很心疼。
    现在是我们执行毛主席指示的紧要关头，为了把我们的企业办好，为了能够更好地准备迎接全国建设事业，必须给贪污浪费和官僚主义现象以无情地揭发和打击，深入地开展一个系统的、全面的、有领导的、发动群众的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的斗争。
    什么叫做贪污？
    凡是公家的钱财、物品等等，不应该为自己所得，而攫为个人所有，以及利用职权，侵吞、盗窃、勒索、受贿等可耻行为，都是贪污。
    在我们铁路系统中，这种贪污现象极容易发生。如运价尚未公布实行前，把消息泄漏给商人；或把我们预购材料及出包工程的消息，泄漏给商人，使商人投机取巧，抬高市价，个人从中收受报酬贿赂。采购人员勾通私商，吃回扣、写假票据，直接受贿，接受私商礼物；或勾结商人，抬高市价，得利分肥，动用公款，或用公家名义，贱价购买材料，公家用时高价出卖。各种保管人员，私用公物及盗卖资财。各种经手款项的人，贪污存款利息。运输人员向商人、货栈借款不还，收受礼物贿赂。行李员在行李车上盗取旅客货物行李。卖票员、查票员、财务检查员，贪污票款。一般人员很多假报出差费，及各种开支报销。铁路公安部门没收违禁品不缴国库，作为本单位的财产，甚至出卖或攫为己有。在修建工程中和建筑部门中，接触私商，贪污腐化，等等。上述各种贪污办法，大部分铁路上都会有。
    什么是浪费呢？
    铁路系统中的浪费，从总的方面看来，可以分为以下四类：（1）基本建设的浪费。包括设计、计划不周密；无设计即行施工；边设计、边施工；反工窝工；因而造成的浪费。据西南工程局的初步检查，九个工务段及二个工程队，共计浪费八十九亿八千八百多万元。这些浪费，多是由于粗枝大叶、不负责任，因而多用炸药、设计不周、改线及质量不良、地基下沉等造成的。除西南工程局应继续深入检查外，各局也应广泛地展开民主检查。（2）经营管理上的浪费。如积压材料、积压资金、机构不够合理，上层机构和机关人员多，造成人力和时间上的浪费。如铁道部机关内今年一月至十一月份出差人员累计达五、一七五人，共计五七、○○八天，平均每人十一天，共计用出差费三四二、○五一、一○一元。当然，为了深入下层，了解工作，出差是必要的，但是有的出差是无计划、无目的地转来转去，存在着很大浪费。（3）开会、招待，以及供应机关工作方面的浪费。六月全国管理局长会议原预算四百万元，实支二千九百二十多万元，全国铁路劳动模范代表大会原预算八亿五千万元，后追加预算五亿四千多万元。全国铁路展览会原预算三亿元，实支六亿五千万元，虽然会议开得很好，虽然追加预算有延期等原因，但严格检查，还是有浪费现象。从一月至十一月，铁道部召开专业会议及小型会议共计三十七次，共计参加会议人数二、七三六人。时间共为三八八天，共开支一六四、七三九、六四○元，为了工作，固然应该开会，开会也解决了不少工作问题，但由于计划不周准备不足，造成时间的浪费是不少的。据检查，有的会议发生过以会议费挪用于会餐和娱乐费的事实。（4）生活上的浪费，有一部分人，藉口工作关系，乱花乱用，这是必须检查纠正的。特别是我们派出去的人员中发现有贪污腐化的严重情形。湘西某测量队就发生过类似的事情，这些都需要检查。
    在进行中应该纠正几种不正确
        的认识：
    1、有人说：机关没有什么，或说我这部门没有什么。我们要反对这种论调。贪污浪费，机关可能少一些，但也不一定。材料、生计、总务、运输部门，直接掌握采购及保管财款的人，可能多一些。
    2、有人说：机关只有定员重要，如能适当加以解决，则可大大提高工作效率。我们认为机关的定员，特别是今天铁道部机关的定员问题，确是一个重要问题。但不能因此就说机关只有定员重要。就经济意义上说，铁道部机关人员，每人每年平均花费，包括工资、办公、杂费等在内，共为九八○万元，如减去七百人，每年便可节省开支六八亿多元。但是我们能不能说，我们机关就不会发现这样大的贪污数字呢？如果加上浪费和官僚主义工作作风所引起的工作上和经济上的损失，我们可以肯定是比这数字大得更多的，更不要说在政治上的损失了。
    3、有的人说：贪污是因为生活苦，生活不苦谁贪污？这是比较流行的一种说法。我们认为这也是不对的，而且也不合事实。我们可以问，贪污分子中，真正为了养家，解决家庭困难的有多少？而且难道说因为家中困难，就可以按照困难的需要来贪污吗？事实上我们很少发现确为解决生活困难而贪污的。况且我们铁路职工的生活，是比从前逐渐改善着。绝对多数的贪污分子是喜欢挥霍的，堕落、蜕化供个人自由享乐的。现在实行低薪制，生活比较清苦是事实，但不能作为庇护贪污分子的口实。
    4、有人说：增产是积极的，节约是消极的。这种说法也不对。我们说增产也好，节约也好，都是积极的。苏联是把节约作为社会主义的资本积累的方法的。有很多人又说，这叫做大篓洒香油，到处拾芝麻。我们说，这叫做既不准许大篓洒香油，又要到处拾芝麻。当然，我们今天反贪污反浪费，并不是拾芝麻问题，实际上大家看看今天到处贪污浪费的情形，就可以知道这不能是一个应该消极对待的问题。
    5、也有人说：运动来了一个又一个，搞不完，愈搞愈大。好像有点厌倦运动的意思。几千年的老大中国，遗留下来的坏风气很多，必须逐渐把它们除掉。必须把每一个人的思想认识加以改造，运动必须一个接着一个来。而且愈来力量是愈大的。要正视这种发展的规律性。正如我们每天要起床、睡觉、吃饭、穿衣一样。为什么要感到厌倦呢？
    另外有一种意见，存在着过关思想。须知这并不是过公家的关，而是过自己的关，如果真正想把自己提高，把毛病去掉，就必须老老实实过每一个必须过的关。
    为了把这一工作做好，必须贯彻首长负责、亲自动手，依靠群众，发动群众的方针。要做到首长以身作则，开展批评与自我批评，大大地发扬民主，给群众撑腰，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风。加强和提高职工爱护国家财产的责任心和积极性，做到人人都鄙视那种贪污浪费恶劣腐朽的行为。
    处理的方针要根据中央指示精神，采取惩办与教育相结合的方针，按其情节大小轻重，给以批评教育以及行政、刑事处分，以至最严厉的制裁。好的要表扬。要把由下而上的揭发检举，和由上而下的检查结合进行。设立意见箱，可以不记名投送检举书，不论机关内外均可随时检举。如有限制别人意见或威胁别人提意见者，一经发觉或经检举，得加重处理。
    自动坦白和别人检举相结合，自动坦白者按情节减轻处罚，重者轻，轻者免；经别人检举者，按情节轻重，得加重处罚，抵抗者加重处罚。
    反贪污反浪费反官僚主义，必须要切实结合进行。凡是贪污浪费严重的地方，其领导上的官僚主义作风亦是严重的地方。因此，这次运动要达到肃清贪污浪费，改进工作的目的，为今后增产节约开拓良好的道路。
    为了深入开展这一运动，我们决定成立机关增产节约委员会，并设立办公室，领导这一工作。各局、处成立分会，局、处以下单位成立小组。各局、处在北京的附属企业单位成立支会，凡北京地区以外的直属机关均交地方负责领导进行，并成立检查组，重点协助进行。
    各单位并需做好详细计划和进行的步骤。关于时间问题我们决定一直进行到深入彻底为止，现在我们可暂定一个月的计划。
