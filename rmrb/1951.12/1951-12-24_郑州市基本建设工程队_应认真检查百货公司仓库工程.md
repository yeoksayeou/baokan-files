    Zhengzhou Basic Construction Engineering Team
    Should Carefully Inspect the Department Store Warehouse Project
    To the Editor: The Zhengzhou Department Store's large warehouse project was completed on June 15th of this year. This project was undertaken by the Zhengzhou Basic Construction Engineering Team. Due to inadequate preliminary design, failure to construct according to the original design, and the use of substandard materials, errors occurred. For example, the warehouse was not covered with tar felt, but only coated with tung oil; the warehouse lacked ventilation equipment; and the surrounding walls were too low, which was not conducive to security. The eaves of the warehouse were originally planned to be seven centimeters, but the actual construction resulted in only five centimeters, which is a result of not constructing according to the original design. In terms of materials used, the quality of the tiles used was very poor, with a high sand content, leading to serious leaks during rain, which caused significant damage to the stored goods.
    After the above-mentioned problems were discovered, the Zhengzhou Department Store and the local administrative authorities convened the directly responsible party leading the construction of this warehouse, the Basic Construction Engineering Team, as well as the state-owned Xinghua Construction Company, the state-owned Workers' Construction Cooperative, and the state-owned Construction Enterprise Company, to discuss remedial measures. The Xinghua Construction Company and the other two units initially stated that they could not be held responsible for leaks in the event of major storms and heavy rain, and could only be responsible for minor rain leaks; they then proposed an irresponsible "repair as it leaks" approach. After strict criticism from the Zhengzhou Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, they agreed to repair it. As for the Basic Construction Engineering Team, they remained silent throughout, not uttering a word. We believe that this attitude is incorrect, is deliberately evading responsibility, and should be investigated.

### 郑州市基本建设工程队  应认真检查百货公司仓库工程

    郑州市基本建设工程队
    应认真检查百货公司仓库工程
    编辑同志：郑州市百货公司大仓库工程，已经在今年六月十五日完工。这个工程是郑州市基本建设工程队承建的。由于事先设计不周，不按原有设计施工，用料又不合规格，以致发生错误。比如仓库没有用油毛毡覆盖，只涂了桐油；库房缺乏通风设备；四周围墙太低，不利于警卫。仓房檐原定要七公分，建筑结果只有五公分，这是不按照原设计施工的结果。在用料方面，所用的瓦质量甚劣，沙性很大，在天雨时发生严重的漏雨现象，使储藏的物资受到重大损害。
    在检查出上述毛病后，郑州市百货公司和当地行政当局召集领导建筑这个仓库的直接负责者基本建设工程队，以及承建这个工程的公营兴华建筑公司、公营工人建筑合作社和公营建筑企业公司商谈补救办法。兴华建筑公司等三单位开始表示：如遇大风暴雨，仓漏无法负责，只能负小雨漏水的责任；继又提出“随漏随修”的不负责的意见。经郑州市财政经济委员会严格批评，他们才同意补修。至于基本建设工程队则始终沉默，未发一言。我们认为这样的态度是不对的，是故意规避责任，应作检查。    刘书智
