Encountering Strikes and Various Economic Difficulties
US Military Production Plan Forced to Postpone
Aircraft and Tank Production Plans Cannot be Completed as Scheduled

[Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: Shortages of machinery, raw materials, and manpower, as well as strikes, inflation, and other economic difficulties, have severely hindered the US government's vigorously promoted military production plan. This plan has had to be revised and postponed because it has failed to be completed in key areas.

Wilson, the director of the "Defense Mobilization Administration," which is responsible for implementing the US arms expansion plan, admitted in his second-quarter work report this year that military production was 20 percent behind schedule due to various difficulties. He also revealed that due to the rapid inflation, the government had spent an additional $7 billion on purchasing weapons and military supplies in one year.

Now, more news has revealed that the US military production is falling further and further behind its original targets. The London "Financial Times" on November 6 published a Washington dispatch reporting that the various important tasks of the US war preparation plan were proceeding "very slowly." Among the various military productions, the most serious problem was aircraft production, which the US government listed as its top priority. A United Press dispatch from Washington on November 15 also revealed that, according to sources from the US Department of Defense, "the Air Force had to postpone its scheduled date of establishing 95 large squadrons in 1952 to 1953." The main reason for the postponement was "sluggish production." This sluggishness has left the United States stretched thin in meeting the consumption of the Korean War and the war preparation needs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The London "Financial Times" pointed out that the same slow phenomenon also exists in another important aspect of the US arms expansion plan—tank production. Although the target originally scheduled to be reached by the middle of next year has been revised, it still has to be postponed to the end of the year. The results of the investigation by the US Defense Production Administration acknowledged that there are two main reasons for this backwardness: first, the original plan was "too ambitious," and second, there is an extreme shortage of steel and the establishment of new factories is slow. The Defense Production Administration's investigation also stated that the production of other types of weapons and ammunition, as well as tractor engines, is also far behind schedule. When analyzing the reasons why US military production is behind schedule, the "Financial Times" pointed out that the lack of many important metal raw materials such as high-speed steel, high-heat steel, cobalt, nickel, steel, lead, and other metals, parts, and machine tools is one of the main reasons, and the lack of construction equipment is another main reason. The "Financial Times" did not mention the increasingly developing strike movement since the summer of this year. According to US newspapers, these strikes, most of which occurred in the so-called "defense" industry sectors, have severely hit military production.

### 遭遇罢工和经济上种种困难  美军备生产计划被迫推迟  飞机坦克生产计划不能如期完成

    遭遇罢工和经济上种种困难
    美军备生产计划被迫推迟
    飞机坦克生产计划不能如期完成
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：机器、原料和人力的不足以及罢工、通货膨胀和其他的经济困难，已使美国政府所全力推行的军备生产计划受到重大阻碍。这个计划由于在主要方面未能完成，目前已不得不修正和推延。
    美国负责执行扩军计划的“国防动员署”署长威尔生在他今年第二季度的工作报告中曾经承认，由于种种困难，军备生产落后于原定计划百分之二十。他还透露，由于急剧的通货膨胀，一年间政府在购买武器及军需上曾多花了七十亿美元。
    现在已有更多的消息透露，美国军备生产落后于原定目标愈来愈远。十一月六日的伦敦“金融时报”登载一则华盛顿的消息，报道美国备战计划的各项重要工作进行得“甚为缓慢”，在各项军事生产中问题最为严重的是被美国政府列于首要地位的飞机生产。合众社在十一月十五日从华盛顿发出的电讯中也透露：从美国国防部人士方面获得的消息是，“空军不得不把它在一九五二年内建立九十五个大队的预定日期推迟到一九五三年间”，推迟的主要原因是“生产的呆滞”。这种呆滞已使得美国在应付朝鲜战争的消耗和北大西洋集团的备战需要方面捉襟见肘。
    伦敦“金融时报”指出，在美国扩军计划的另一个重要方面——坦克生产上，也同样存在缓慢的现象。原定明年中达到的目标，虽然已经经过修正，但是仍然不得不延至年底。美国国防生产局调查的结果承认，这种落后情况的主要原因有二，第一是原定计划“野心过大”，第二是钢极度缺乏，新工厂建立迟缓。国防生产局的调查还说明，在其他种类的武器和弹药以及拖拉引擎等方面，生产也落后于计划很远。“金融时报”分析美国军备生产落后于计划的原因时指出，许多重要金属原料如高速钢、高热钢、钴、镍、鈛、钢、铅等以及其他金属、零件和工作母机的缺乏是主要原因之一，建筑设备的不足是另一主要原因。 “金融时报”没有提到今年夏天以来日益发展的罢工运动，据美国报纸透露，这些大部分发生于所谓“国防”工业部门的罢工，曾严重地打击了军备生产。
