    Tianjin Cotton Textile Factories
    Promote the "1951 Weaving Method"
    The North China Textile Administration Bureau and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union have decided to promote the "1951 Weaving Method" in all cotton textile factories in Tianjin. A promotion committee has now been established in Tianjin. Tianjin representatives who participated in the National Weaving Method Conference and the "1951 Weaving Method" training class will serve as teachers and will be divided into automatic loom and ordinary loom groups to promote the method in various factories. A mobilization meeting for the promotion of the 1951 Weaving Method throughout the city was held on the 1st.
    The weaving workers of Tianjin urgently request to learn this advanced weaving method. Many workers at the state-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory have now automatically learned the patrol pattern, reducing the substandard cloth rate by one percent. Eighty percent of the weaving workers at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory have also learned the ordinary loom method. After learning the new method, worker Yin Zhishen of the factory achieved an average daily output of 37 yards per loom, one yard more than before, and without any substandard cloth.

    天津各棉纺织厂
    推广“一九五一织布工作法”
    华北纺织管理局和中国纺织工会天津市委员会已决定在天津市各棉纺织厂中推行“一九五一织布工作法”。现天津市已组成推广委员会，由参加全国织布工作法会议和“一九五一织布工作法”训练班的天津市代表做教师，分成自动布机和普通布机两组分别到各厂去推广。全市推广一九五一织布工作法的动员大会已在一日举行。
    天津市织布工人迫切要求学习这一先进织布工作法。国营天津第四棉纺织厂不少工人现在已自动学会了巡回规律，使次布率降低了百分之一。国营天津第二棉纺织厂也有百分之八十的织布工人学会了普通布机工作法。该厂工人殷志森学习新工作法后，每日每台布机产量平均达到三十七码，比以前多出一码，而且没有次布。    （新华社）
