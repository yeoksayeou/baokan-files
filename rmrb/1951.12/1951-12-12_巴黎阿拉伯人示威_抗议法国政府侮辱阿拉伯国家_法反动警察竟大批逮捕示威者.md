Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: According to a report from the "Pravda" correspondent in Paris, Zhukov: On the evening of December 8th, numerous Algerian people's democratic and cultural organizations in Paris held a banquet at the Winter Velodrome to entertain delegations from Arab and Islamic countries attending the United Nations General Assembly. This banquet was banned by order of the police authorities. Consequently, tens of thousands of Arabs residing in Paris organized a protest demonstration. Despite the police authorities employing various barbaric methods, the demonstration persisted for three hours, from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

The authorities dispatched large numbers of police to disperse the demonstration. Fully armed with submachine guns and tear gas, they filled the area within two kilometers of the Winter Velodrome. However, all of this failed to prevent the Arabs in Paris from demonstrating against the French government's order banning the banquet. This order was a great insult to the Arab and Islamic countries.

Clashes occurred between demonstrators and police in many places, spreading to the Place de la Bastille. The police's suppression of the demonstrators aroused great anger among the citizens of Paris. Everywhere, people could be heard shouting slogans: "Fascists!" "National Chauvinists!" "Gestapo!"

The police arrested several thousand Arabs; the police headquarters' official figure was six thousand. Because the number of those arrested was so large that even the prisons could not accommodate them, many people were driven into barracks. Hospitals were immediately transformed into temporary prisons. Parc Monceau also became a formal concentration camp.

The Joint Committee of Algerian Organizations, which organized the banquet, has issued a statement protesting the police authorities' atrocities. Public opinion in Paris believes that this police action is an open provocation against the delegations of Arab countries.

    巴黎阿拉伯人示威
    抗议法国政府侮辱阿拉伯国家
    法反动警察竟大批逮捕示威者
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：据“真理报”驻巴黎记者朱可夫报道：十二月八日晚上，在巴黎的阿尔及利亚人民的许多民主团体和文化团体在冬季赛车场举行宴会，招待阿拉伯国家和回教国家出席联合国大会的代表团。这个宴会为警察当局下令禁止，于是，成千成万留居在巴黎的阿拉伯人就组织了抗议示威。虽然警察局施用了各种野蛮手段，但是，示威游行仍然坚持了三个钟头，从晚上七点钟一直延续到十点钟。
    当局出动了大队警察来冲散示威队伍。他们全副武装，拿着冲锋枪和催泪弹，布满了冬季赛车场周围两公里以内的地区，但是，这一切都并不能阻止巴黎的阿拉伯人举行示威，以反对法国政府禁止宴会的命令。这个命令对各阿拉伯国家和回教国家是莫大的侮辱。
    示威者和警察在许多地方发生了冲突，一直蔓延到巴士底广场。警察对示威者的镇压手段引起了巴黎市民的极大愤怒。到处可以听到人们高呼口号：“法西斯分子！”“民族仇视分子！”“盖斯塔波！”
    警察逮捕了好几千名阿拉伯人，警察局公报发表的数字是六千名。因为被捕的人已多到连监狱都无法容纳，因此，有许多人被驱入兵营。医院立即变成临时监狱。蒙梭公园也变成了正式的集中营。
    主办这次宴会的各阿尔及利亚团体联合委员会已发表公报，对警察当局的暴行提出抗议。巴黎各界舆论认为这种警察行动是对于阿拉伯国家代表团的公开挑衅。
