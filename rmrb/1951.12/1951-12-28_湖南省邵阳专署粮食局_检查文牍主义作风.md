    Shaoyang Special District Grain Bureau, Hunan Province
    Examines Bureaucratic Work Style
    Comrade Editor: After reading the news about the "Anti-Bureaucracy Document Exhibition Held by Central Political and Legal Departments" published in the People's Daily on November 30th, I recognized the harm of bureaucracy to the revolutionary cause. We immediately combined it with the study of "Striving to Protect State Secrets" and conducted a general review of the documents we have handled in the past two years. We discovered that when compiling the roster for requesting weapons for warehouse cadres last year, the relevant documents included: one decision, two instructions, four notices, eight reports, and countless informal notes. It went back and forth three times from the county to the special district, and from the special district to the province, passing through the hands of eleven grain bureau directors and deputy directors, seven county heads, five county party secretaries, one organization department head, six public security bureau chiefs, one county battalion commander, and one armed forces minister, with a total of 43 official seals and 217 private chops, passing through 32 government agencies, taking half a year and seventeen days, to create sixteen rosters (the Shaoyang Special District has jurisdiction over six counties, some counties created more, some counties did not create them midway). In the end, after being reviewed and returned by the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau, it was still not in compliance with the regulations, so we had no choice but to not create them, and the weapons were not received either. The occurrence of this incident illustrates the blindness and lack of specific arrangements in our past work, simply circling around in bureaucracy. When documents from higher authorities arrived, we didn't think about the situation below, but simply copied and forwarded them, opening our mouths to ask the lower levels. As a result, some could not be obtained, and some that were obtained were perfunctory, and although so much manpower, material resources, and time were spent, nothing was achieved. In the future, in addition to continuing to conduct in-depth inspections and waging an irreconcilable struggle against bureaucracy, we also hope that administrative departments at all levels will vigorously conduct inspections, expose and criticize bureaucracy, and establish a scientific work style.
Deputy Director of Shaoyang Special District Grain Bureau, Hunan Province    Wang Shirun

    湖南省邵阳专署粮食局
    检查文牍主义作风
    编辑同志：看了人民日报十一月三十日刊登的“中央政法部门举办反文牍主义公文展览会”的消息，我认识了文牍主义对于革命事业的危害性。我们随即结合“为保守国家机密而斗争”的学习，把两年来所办的文卷，作了一次总清查。发现在去年编造请领仓库干部武器的名册时，有关文件竟有：一个决定、两个指示、四个通知、八个报告以及无数的便函。从县到专署、从专署到省，往返兜了三个大圈子，中间经过了正副粮食局长十一人、县长七人、县委书记五人、组织部长一人、公安局长六人、县大队长一人和武装部长一人的手，共盖大印四十三颗、私章二百十七颗，通过了三十二个政府机关，历时半年零十七天，才造成了十六份名册（邵阳专区共辖六县、有些县多造了，有些县中途没造了）。最后，经湖南省粮食局批回，还是不合规定，只好不造了，武器也不领了。这件事情的发生，说明了我们以往工作中的盲目性和缺乏具体布置，只是在文牍主义里兜圈子。上级公文来了，不想一想下边的情况，只是照抄照转，张开嘴向下边要。结果有的要不上来，有的要上来也是敷衍应付的，虽然耗费了这么些人力、物力和时间，却得不到什么结果。今后我们除了继续深入检查，和文牍主义作不调和的斗争外，还希望各级行政部门，大力进行对文牍主义的检查，揭发和批评，树立科学的工作作风。湖南省邵阳专署粮食局副局长    王士润
