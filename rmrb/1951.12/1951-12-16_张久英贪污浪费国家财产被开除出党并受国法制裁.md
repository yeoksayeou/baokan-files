    Zhang Jiuying Expelled from the Party and Punished by Law for Embezzling and Wasting State Property

    Zhang Jiuying, who was in charge of management work for the Lanfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, led a corrupt life and embezzled and wasted state property. He has been expelled from the Party and punished by law. In the year from June 1950 to June 1951, he embezzled a total of 463,700 yuan in RMB, 424 jin of miscellaneous grains, 601 jin of millet, 180 jin of wheat, 55 jin of rice, and 35 jin of miscellaneous flour; wasted 1,709 jin of wheat, 39 jin of miscellaneous grains, and 364,200 yuan in RMB; and privately lent 3,000,000 yuan of public funds to local bullies and ruffians. Finally, Zhang Jiuying stole more than 400,000 yuan of public funds and fled. He fled to Zhengzhou and was arrested by the Lanfeng County Public Security Bureau. In order to purify the Party organization, the Lanfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China expelled Zhang Jiuying from the Party and sent him to the court for punishment; the court sentenced him to three years in prison. Zhang Jiuying was originally the head of a section in the Lanfeng County Industry and Commerce Bureau. Because of his corruption, he was given the disciplinary action of being placed on probation within the Party and having his work outside the Party revoked. In order to educate and transform him, the Lanfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred him to the Lanfeng County Committee Office to continue his reflection, and at the same time asked him to manage administrative work. However, Zhang Jiuying did not know how to repent, and in the end, he embarked on the road of breaking away from the Party and the people.
