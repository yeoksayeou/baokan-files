The Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team in Niangniangmiao Village, Daming County, Hebei Province, was organized in 1945. Now, it has developed into a large-scale mutual aid team combining agricultural and sideline production. It has made great achievements in developing production and has become a banner in the mutual aid movement in Hebei Province. The whole team has thirty-two households, seventeen male laborers, and thirty-three female laborers, with a total of 513 mu of cultivated land. It owns six waterwheels, five sprayers, one weeding machine, three 7-inch plows, five mules and horses, one rubber-wheeled cart, an oil mill, a chicken hatchery, a chicken farm, forty beehives, and 12 million yuan in working capital. The team also has a technical research office, which is divided into livestock, fertilizer, pest control, seed, and cultural groups, each with dedicated personnel in charge.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Niangniangmiao Village had no paddy fields. The average yield of dry land per mu was equivalent to 170 jin of millet. In 1949, the average yield of dry land per mu in the Zhang Xishun team was equivalent to 200 jin of millet, and the yield of paddy fields was 500 jin. In 1950, the average yield of dry land per mu was equivalent to 350 jin of millet, and the yield of paddy fields was 850 jin. This year, in the patriotic production campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team led the entire village in launching a patriotic high-yield competition and formulated a patriotic high-yield plan. The yield increased again compared to last year. The average yield of dry land per mu was equivalent to 400 to 450 jin of millet, exceeding the pre-war level by 135 to 165 percent; the average yield of paddy fields per mu was 950 to 1,000 jin, an increase of 90 to 100 percent compared to 1949. The team has more than two mu of high-yield experimental land, creating a new record of 1,118 jin of millet per mu.

How did the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team develop and grow?

1.  Agricultural production and sideline production are combined year-round, and sideline production supports agricultural production.

When the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team was first established in the spring of 1945, it only implemented labor and animal power exchange in agricultural production. In the winter of the same year, they began to pool shares to operate sideline businesses using idle labor. By 1946, they had gradually earned money and bought livestock. They also pooled shares to open an oil mill, and at the end of the year, each share received 350 jin of oil cake as dividends. This laid the foundation for sideline production within the team. At this time, the mutual aid team had expanded from five households to seventeen households. In 1947, they began raising pigs to accumulate manure, and the pig manure and the oil cake distributed last year were all applied to the land. This was better than applying oil cake alone. In this year, the yield per mu reached the pre-war production level (170 jin of millet). Sideline production supported agricultural production, improving the level of agricultural production. In 1948, the mutual aid team expanded to twenty-three households; in addition to the bumper harvest in agriculture, each household received 900 jin of soybean cake as dividends in sideline production. In 1949, in order to fight drought, the team began to dig wells and install waterwheels together, ensuring timely planting. In this year, the average yield per mu exceeded the pre-war level by 70 jin. In sideline production, in addition to the oil mill, they also organized labor to engage in transportation; and absorbed floating capital to open a manure factory and a credit cooperative. In the spring of 1950, in order to improve agricultural and sideline production technology, a technical research office was established to lead the entire team in implementing seed soaking, seed selection, and trial use of chemical fertilizers. They also added some wells and waterwheels to expand the area of paddy fields. In this year, they established contact with the county supply and marketing cooperative. The mutual aid team provided oil pressing for the supply and marketing cooperative, and the supply and marketing cooperative promoted the team's products. Sideline production was very profitable. In addition to using the money earned to invest in agricultural production, they also bought mules, horses, and rubber-wheeled carts together, and increased sideline production such as chicken hatching, chicken raising, and beekeeping. The mutual aid team became increasingly prosperous. Farmers in the village said, "Organizing together is better than working alone." Therefore, the team expanded to twenty-seven households last year and to thirty-two households this year.

2.  Labor is used uniformly, and scientific division of labor is based on technology.

After establishing the oil mill in 1946, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team assigned a group of people to specialize in oil pressing. In 1947, dedicated personnel were assigned to lead both agricultural production and the oil mill. In 1949, a group of people were organized to specialize in transportation. In 1950, they went a step further and implemented division of labor based on individual technical strengths in agriculture, chicken hatching, beekeeping, livestock raising, transportation, and oil mills. This year, dedicated personnel were assigned to manage the chicken farm. The agricultural work of those who specialize in sideline production is completed by the agricultural production team. The people responsible for agricultural production are divided into three groups. In addition to mainly carrying out agricultural production, the team leader can temporarily allocate labor uniformly according to the needs of other production. For example, when the oil mill needs to add people to press oil, labor can be drawn from these three agricultural groups in rotation. Those responsible for sideline production also participate in agricultural production in their spare time. There is also a division of labor in agricultural production technology, divided into seed, fertilizer, and pest control groups. The seed group is responsible for leading the team and driving farmers outside the team to select seeds, soak seeds, and promote improved varieties; the fertilizer group specializes in making comparative experiments on the effectiveness of fertilizers; the pest control group is responsible for researching and testing various pesticides.

Scientific division of labor under the principle of unified use of labor, on the one hand, further strengthened the cooperative relationship between team members, making everyone feel that no one can do without anyone else, and on the other hand, it also made it easier to improve technology. Without division of labor and cooperation, scattered individual small-scale production would not be able to master various technologies to carry out diversified production.

3.  Production develops day by day, and the economic ties between team members become closer day by day; at the same time, the dividend system and equivalent methods are becoming more and more perfect.

When the exchange of human and animal power was first implemented, both parties benefited, so the mutual aid team developed from temporary labor exchange to long-term mutual assistance. In 1947, because the team's sideline production needed funds, it stipulated a dividend method of 60% for labor and 40% for capital, absorbing the team members' floating capital.

In 1950, due to the increase in the team's collectively owned property and the lack of capital was not so severe, the dividend method was changed to 70% for labor and 30% for capital, so as to give play to the enthusiasm of labor. The equivalent price in agricultural production is to adopt the "flat tillage point" method, that is, the land brought into the team by a laborer is taken as the "flat tillage point" with ten mu, and each mu above the "flat tillage point" yields six and a half jin of rice, and each mu below the "flat tillage point" receives six and a half jin of rice. The advantage of this method is that it is simple and easy to implement. However, laborers have strengths and weaknesses, technologies have high and low levels, and land has distances and quality. This method cannot achieve truly equivalent mutual benefit. As production gradually develops, this method will limit the exertion of labor enthusiasm. Therefore, this year, the "flat tillage point" method was abolished, and all male and female full laborers and semi-laborers in the team were rated into different levels according to their labor strength and technical level, and the work was recorded according to the length of working time, what kind of work they did, and the quality of the work. Animal power is also recorded in the same way as human power. This achieves basic equivalence, can give play to everyone's strengths, and can also give play to the role of semi-laborers. In sideline production, as production develops, more funds are accumulated. In order to further give play to the enthusiasm of labor and avoid the phenomenon of individual capital shares expanding and exploiting other people's labor, this year the team changed the dividend method of 70% for labor and 30% for capital to a dividend method of capital following labor. Each full laborer in the mutual aid team (the semi-laborers in this mutual aid team do not often participate in production and do not enter the sideline stock) brings capital of 300 jin of peanuts. Those with special skills can also reduce the capital brought in after everyone's evaluation. Twenty percent of the profit from sideline production is used as the team's public accumulation fund, and the rest is distributed uniformly by the entire team. Each laborer participating in agricultural or sideline production can get a share. (Because each laborer either participates in agricultural production or participates in sideline production, and they all bring the same amount of shares.) The team also has a "super-quota reward" method. For example, the oil mill stipulates how much oil cake and how much oil should be produced for 100 jin of peanuts, and rewards are given for exceeding the quota. If some team members get agricultural wages or sideline dividends and do not need money for the time being, they can deposit it in the team and receive a small amount of interest; if some team members have difficulties, they can also borrow the team's collectively owned funds after democratic discussion. This gradually moving towards a fair and reasonable equivalent system and dividend method is a concrete guarantee for consolidating and expanding the mutual aid team.

4.  The process of the mutual aid team's development and growth is also a process of carrying out collectivist ideological education.

When the organization was first established, two of the five households with livestock were afraid of suffering losses and wanted to withdraw from the mutual aid team. Team leader Zhang Xishun convened a meeting of the entire team, explaining that farmers all over the world are one family and asking farmers who had turned over to help each other; and specifically calculated the accounts, explaining that exchanging human power for animal power would not cause losses to either party. After these two households with livestock understood this, the mutual aid team changed from temporary exchange of labor to long-term mutual assistance. After the content of production became increasingly complex and the collectively owned property within the team gradually increased, the mutual aid team, due to a period of lax political and ideological education, experienced the problem of team members withdrawing from the team in the winter of 1950. One team member, because he had learned beekeeping technology, thought that raising bees individually would be more profitable than in the team and wanted to withdraw from the team; two households, seeing that the team's sideline business had expanded, were afraid of losing money and also withdrew from the team; another team member withdrew from the team because he was selfish and had a quarrel with a team member. In order to solve these problems, the Chinese Communist Party Niangniangmiao Village Branch led the advanced elements in the team to carry out collectivist ideological education on these people who withdrew from the team from the perspective of solving specific problems. Everyone said to the person who had learned beekeeping technology and wanted to withdraw from the team: "You learned beekeeping because the team organized and implemented division of labor. The team did your farm work for you, and you can still get dividends from other sideline businesses. When you go to other villages to learn how to move bees, all the compensation is the responsibility of the team. This is one person for everyone, and everyone for one person. This is the benefit of being organized. Now you want to withdraw from the team and raise bees individually, who will do your agricultural work?" After everyone's persuasion and education, the team member understood and did not withdraw from the team. For those two households who were afraid of losing money, everyone repeatedly educated them about their conservative ideas of not daring to develop greatly. However, they were not forced to stay in the team. When summarizing winter production, these two households saw that sideline production had made profits again, so they voluntarily asked to rejoin the team. The farmer who withdrew from the team because of a quarrel, first underwent individual talks with the Chinese Communist Party members in the team, and then underwent criticism and self-criticism from the entire team. After rules and regulations were established, he also voluntarily returned to the team. Since these problems occurred, the Chinese Communist Party Niangniangmiao Village Branch has paid more attention to carrying out political leadership and ideological leadership over the mutual aid team, so that the mutual aid team can be consolidated in the continuous struggle against backward ideas.

Several issues that this mutual aid team should pay attention to solving in the future

From the development process of the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team, strengthening economic ties and improving production, division of labor and cooperation in technology, paying attention to collectivist ideological education, and improving the equivalent two-benefit system are the four main links in consolidating and expanding the mutual aid team. These four aspects are gradually developing, and they are interconnected and indispensable. However, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team has not yet achieved perfection in every aspect. At present, this mutual aid team must also pay attention to solving the following important problems:

First, the issue of the development direction of the mutual aid team

This summer, the team members had the following two thoughts: one was to put the land into shares and engage in agricultural production cooperatives. But there is also another idea: because the team's sideline business is very profitable and developing rapidly, the team leader and team members attach great importance to sideline business. In this case, the following problems have arisen: First, agriculture has been relaxed. Vigorously developing sideline production is necessary and correct, but it is wrong to relax agricultural production because of this. The correct approach should be to support agriculture with sideline business and further improve agricultural production. Second, the phenomenon of exploiting labor outside the team has emerged. For example, the team absorbs labor outside the team to engage in transportation. In form, it is a dividend relationship, but in essence, it is an employment relationship. Because the people who help the team engage in transportation only get a part of the freight, but the profits from operating the transportation are higher than the freight. The mutual aid team should never exploit the masses outside the team, but should attract farmers to join the team or help them organize themselves. Third, they want to turn some sideline businesses into pure buying and selling. For example, this summer the team planned to open porcelain shops and iron shops. From this point of view, it is easy to embark on the road of speculative business. Although these phenomena are not very serious now, they are already issues that deserve attention. Judging from the actual situation of the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team, it already has the basic conditions for moving towards an agricultural production cooperative: First, there is a foundation for mutual aid, and the team members have initially developed collective habits. Second, the team members have requested that the land be partnered. Third, there are strong leading backbones.

Second, the issue of popularizing and improving agricultural technology

According to the team's manpower, financial resources, and natural conditions, the team's agricultural high yield can be done better. However, Zhang Xishun's personal high-yield record and the team's high-yield record are still limited to small experimental plots. The experience gained after two years of high-yield experiments should be popularized to all households in the team, and the agricultural production of the entire team and even the entire village should be further improved. Then, on the basis of promotion, research, experimentation, and improvement should continue, and then promotion should be carried out again. Experimentation and promotion must be combined, otherwise, what is the significance of improving and experimenting on small plots of land?

Third, women's labor should be absorbed to participate in production

There are many production activities that women can participate in in the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team, such as beekeeping, chicken raising, and chicken hatching. However, very few women participate in production in this team, and they do not participate regularly. If women participate in sideline production, male labor can be freed up to further improve agricultural production. This is also an issue that cannot be ignored. (Attached picture)

    河北省大名县张希顺互助组的发展道路和必须解决的问题
    史林琪
    河北省大名县娘娘庙村张希顺互助组，在一九四五年组织起来。发展到现在，已经成为一个农业生产和副业生产相结合的大型互助组。它在发展生产上有很大成绩，成为河北省互助运动中的一面旗帜。全组三十二户，十七个男劳动力，三十三个女劳动力，共有耕地五百一十三亩。伙有财产有水车六辆、喷雾器五架、锄草机一架、七吋步犁三张、骡马五匹、胶轮马车一辆、油房、孵鸡房、养鸡场各一个、蜜蜂四十箱、流动资金一千二百万元。组内还设有技术研究室，内分畜牧、肥料、杀虫、种籽、文化等小组，各有专人负责。
    娘娘庙村在抗日战争以前没有水田。旱地每亩平均产量折合谷子一百七十斤。张希顺组一九四九年每亩旱地平均产量折合谷子二百斤，水地合五百斤。一九五○年每亩旱地平均产量折合谷子三百五十斤，水地合八百五十斤。今年在抗美援朝爱国生产运动中，张希顺互助组带动全村，开展了爱国丰产竞赛，制订了爱国丰产计划，产量比去年又有增加。每亩旱地平均产量折合谷子四百斤到四百五十斤，超过战前百分之一百三十五到一百六十五；水地每亩平均产量折合谷子九百五十斤到一千斤，比一九四九年提高了百分之九十到一百。组内有两亩多丰产试验地，创造了每亩产谷一千一百一十八斤的新纪录。
    张希顺互助组是怎样发展壮大
    起来的？
    一、农业生产和副业生产常年结合，副业生产支持农业生产。
    张希顺互助组一九四五年春天开始建立的时候，只实行农业生产上的人力畜力换工。当年冬天，他们利用闲散人力，开始集股经营副业；到一九四六年，陆续赚了钱，买了牲口，又集股伙开了一座油房，年底每股分红得油饼三百五十斤。这样，就给组内的副业生产打下了基础。这时，互助组已由五户扩大到十七户。一九四七年开始喂猪积肥，把猪粪和上年分得的油饼，一起上到地里。这样比单上油饼强。这一年，每亩产量达到了战前的生产水平
    （收谷一百七十斤）。副业生产支持农业生产，提高了农业生产水平。一九四八年，互助组扩大到二十三户；除农业丰收外，在副业方面每户分红得豆饼九百斤。一九四九年，为了抗旱，他们这个组又开始伙打水井、伙装水车，保证了按时下种。这一年，每亩平均产量超过战前七十斤。在副业方面，除油房外，又组织劳动力搞运输；并且吸收游资开了粪厂和信贷社。一九五○年春，为了提高农、副业生产技术，设立了技术研究室，领导全组实行浸种、选种和试用化学肥料，而且添了些水井、水车，扩大了水地面积。这一年，他们和县供销社取得了联系。互助组给供销社榨油，供销社给互助组推销产品。副业得利很大；他们除用赚得的钱投资农业生产以外，又伙买了骡、马、胶轮马车，还增加了孵鸡、养鸡、养蜂等副业生产。互助组越来越富了。村里的农民说：“组织起来就是比单干强。”因此，这个组去年扩大到二十七户，今年又扩大到三十二户。
    二、统一使用劳动力，按技术科学分工。
    张希顺互助组，在一九四六年建立油房以后，就分出一部分人专门打油。一九四七年农业生产和油房都确定了专人负责领导。一九四九年又组织了一部分人专搞运输。一九五○年更进一步，按照各人技术特长，在农业、孵鸡、养蜂、喂养牲口、运输、油房等方面实行分工负责。今年又分出专人管理养鸡场。专管副业生产的人，地里的农活由农业生产小组负责完成。负责农业生产的人共分三个小组，除主要进行农业生产外，根据其他生产需要，可由互助组长临时统一调配劳动力。比如油房需要添人打油时，可在这三个农业小组里轮流抽调人力。负责副业生产的，闲时也参加农业生产。在农业生产技术上也有分工，分为种籽、肥料、除虫等小组。种籽组负责领导本组和带动组外农民选种、浸种、推广优良品种等；肥料组专作肥料效力的比较试验；除虫组负责研究和试用各种杀虫药。
    在统一使用劳动力的原则下进行科学分工，这一方面更加密切了组员间的合作关系，使大家感到谁也离不了谁，一方面也更便于提高技术。如果没有分工合作，分散的个体的小生产是不可能掌握各种技术以进行多样性的生产的。
    三、生产一天比一天发展，组员间在经济上的联系也就一天比一天密切；同时，分红制度、等价办法也越来越完善了。
    在开始实行人力畜力换工时，做到了两不吃亏，因而互助组由临时变工发展到长期互助。一九四七年因为组里副业生产需要资金，规定了劳力分六成、资金分四成的分红办法，吸收了组员的游资。
    一九五○年因组里伙有财产增加，资金也不太缺乏，分红办法改为劳力分七成，资金分三成，这样可以发挥劳动力的积极性。农业生产上的等价是采取“平耕点”的办法，就是一个劳动力带到组内的土地，拿十亩地作“平耕点”，“平耕点”以上每亩出米六斤半，“平耕点”以下每亩得米六斤半。这种办法的好处是简单易行。但劳动力有强弱，技术有高低，土地有远近、好坏，按这种办法不能做到真正等价互利。当生产逐渐发展以后，这种办法就会限制劳动积极性的发挥。因此，今年就废止了“平耕点”的办法，把全组男女整劳动力和半劳动力，按劳动力强弱和技术高低评为不同的等级，记工按做活时间长短、做什么活和做活的好坏为标准。畜力也按人力的记工办法记工。这样就做到了基本等价，能够发挥各人所长，也能发挥半劳动力的作用。在副业方面，随着生产的发展，积累了更多的资金。为了进一步发挥劳动力的积极性和避免个人资金股扩大而发生剥削他人的劳动力的现象，今年这个组又把劳七资三的分红办法改为资金随劳力的分红办法。互助组内每个全劳动力（这个互助组的半劳动力不经常参加生产，不入副业股），随带三百斤花生的资本，有特殊技术的经大家评定后也可减少随带的资本。副业得利百分之二十作为组内公积金，其余由全组统一分配。参加农业或副业生产的每个劳动力都可得一份。（因为每个劳动力不是参加农业生产就是参加副业生产，并且都带有同样数量的股金。）组内又定有“超额奖励”的办法，如油房就规定一百斤花生要打多少油饼，出多少油，超过定额就给予奖励。有的组员得了农业工资或副业分红，家中又一时不需钱用，就可存到组里，分得少许利息；有的组员如果有困难，也可以经过民主讨论，挪借组里的伙有资金。这逐渐走向公平合理的等价制度和分红办法，是巩固和扩大互助组的具体保证。
    四、互助组发展壮大和巩固的过程，同时也是进行集体主义思想教育的过程。
    在开始组织起来的时候，五户中有牲口的两户怕吃亏，想退出互助组。组长张希顺召集全组开会，讲明天下农民是一家的道理，要求翻了身的农民互相帮助；并且具体地算了账，说明人力换畜力两不吃亏。这两户有牲口的农民想通了以后，互助组就由临时换工干活，转为长期互助。在生产内容日益复杂和组内伙有财产逐渐增加以后，这个互助组由于
    一度放松了政治思想教育，在一九五○年冬天曾发生了组员退组问题。有一个组员因为学会了养蜂技术，认为自己单独养蜂比在组里得利大，想退组；有两户看见组里副业经营扩大了，怕赔钱，也退出了组；另一个组员则是因为自私，和一个组员吵了嘴，退出了组。为了解决这些问题，中共娘娘庙村支部领导这个组里的先进分子，从解决具体问题中对这些退组的人进行了集体主义的思想教育。大家对学会养蜂技术要求退组的人说：“你学会养蜂是因为组织起来实行分工，你地里活组里给你作了，其他副业你也照样能分红。你到外村学习移蜂时，
    一切赔贴都由组里负责，这就是一人为了大家，大家也为了一人，这就是组织起来的好处。现在你想退组个人去养蜂，你的农业活谁干呢？”经过大家说服教育之后，这个组员想通了，就没有退组。对那两户怕赔本的，大家针对他们不敢大发展的保守思想反复进行了教育。但也不勉强他们留在组里。到总结冬季生产时，这两户看到副业生产又得了利，就又自动要求重新入组了。因吵嘴退组的那一个农民，先经过组里的中共党员和他进行个别谈话，又经过全组的批评与自我批评，定下纪律和制度，他也自动回到组里了。从发生这些问题以后，中共娘娘庙村支部更加重视了对互助组进行政治领导和思想领导，使互助组在不断和落后思想进行斗争中巩固起来。
    今后这个互助组应当注意解决
    的几个问题
    从张希顺互助组的发展过程看来，在经济上加强联系和提高生产、在技术上分工合作、注意集体主义的思想教育、健全等价两利制度，是巩固和扩大互助组的四个主要环节。这四个方面是逐渐发展的，又是互相联系缺一不可的。但张希顺互助组并不是每一方面都已经做到了完善的地步。目前这个互助组还必须注意解决以下几个重要问题：
    第一、互助组的发展方向问题
    今年夏天，这个组的组员们，有以下两种思想：一种是想把土地入了股，搞农业生产合作社。但是也还有另外一种思想：这个互助组因为副业得利大、发展快，互助组的组长和组员都十分重视副业。在这种情况下，产生了下面几个问题：一是放松了农业。大力发展副业生产是必要的和正确的，但因此而放松了农业生产是不对的。正确的作法应当是以副业支持农业，进一步提高农业生产。二是产生剥削组外劳动力的现象，如这个组吸收组外劳动力去搞运输，形式上是分红关系，实质是雇佣关系。因为帮这个组搞运输的人只分了一部分脚价，而经营运输所得红利却比脚价要高。互助组富了，决不应去剥削组外群众，而应当吸引农民加入本组，或是帮助他们自己组织起来。三是想把一些副业变成单纯做买卖。比如今年夏天这个组曾计划开磁货店、铁货店等。从这种观点出发，很容易走上做投机生意的道路。以上这些现象现在虽还不十分严重，但已是值得加以注意的问题。就张希顺互助组的实际情况看来，它已经具备走向农业生产合作社的基本条件：第一、互助有基础，组员已初步有了集体习惯。第二、组员已要求土地合伙。第三、有较强的领导骨干。
    第二、普及和提高农业技术问题
    根据组里的人力、财力和自然条件，这个组的农业丰产是可以做得更好的。但是，张希顺本人和互助组的丰产纪录都还只限于小块试验地。经过两年的丰产试验，已得的经验应普及到全组各户去，应更进一步地提高全组的以至全村的农业生产量。然后，还应再在推广的基础上继续研究、试验、提高，然后再加以推广。试验和推广必须结合起来，不然，小块地的提高和试验有什么意义呢？
    第三、应吸收妇女劳动力参加生产
    张希顺互助组有许多生产活动妇女是可以参加的，如养蜂、养鸡、孵鸡等。但这个组妇女参加生产的很少，而且不经常。如果妇女参加了副业生产，就可以腾出男劳动力进一步提高农业生产，这也是不可忽视的一个问题。（附图片）
