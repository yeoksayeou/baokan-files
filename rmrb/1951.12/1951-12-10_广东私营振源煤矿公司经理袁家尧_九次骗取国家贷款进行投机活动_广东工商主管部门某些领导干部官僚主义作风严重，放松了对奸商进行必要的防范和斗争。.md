The case of Yuan Jia Yao, manager of Guangdong Private Zhenyuan Coal Mine Company, fraudulently obtaining huge national loans, has been inspected and concluded by the People's Supervisory Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee, and the handling method has been approved by the Central South Military and Political Committee. Those responsible for dereliction of duty will soon receive their due punishment; the criminal Yuan Jia Yao has been arrested by the local People's Government and will be subject to legal sanctions.

Yuan Jia Yao is a big swindler. In 1946, he opened a coal business in Shuiniuwan, Pingshi, northern Guangdong. In 1947, with the support of the pseudo-Guangdong Provincial Construction Department, local landlords, despots, and reactionary officials, he obtained mining rights in the mining area 14 kilometers from Pingshi Station on the Gouyadong branch line of the Yuehan Railway. He raised shares to organize the "Zhenyuan Coal Mine Company," with Yuan serving as general manager. After liberation, Yuan obtained the position of person in charge of the Guangzhou Coal Industry Association and, with the title of "Representative of Private Coal Mines in Guangdong Province," attended the Central South and Central Coal Production and Sales Conferences, swindling and bluffing everywhere. He said that Zhenyuan Coal Mine had more than 600 employees before liberation and more than 400 after liberation; however, later investigation showed that it never exceeded 200 people. He boasted of having 3,000 tons of coal in storage; however, later investigation showed that the maximum coal in storage was only more than 1,300 tons, of which only 101 tons were pure coal, and the remaining more than 1,000 tons were raw coal, which could only yield 20-30% pure coal after washing. He said that the highest monthly output of Zhenyuan Coal Mine was 3,500 tons, and that the average monthly output from January to May 1950 was more than 1,000 tons; however, later investigation showed that the total output of pure coal from January to June 1950 was only 845 tons, there was no production at all from July to December, and from January to April 1951, only 177 tons of pure coal were produced. He also boasted that the mine had reserves of one million tons; in fact, this mine was exploited using indigenous methods and had never been surveyed. Some cadres, without investigation and research, blindly believed his nonsense.

From December 1949 to December 1950, Yuan, using various rogue methods, successively defrauded the state of nine loans, totaling 1.46 billion yuan. In addition to repaying a portion in the form of borrowing large and repaying small, and delivering a portion of coal, he still owed 1.018 billion yuan. In addition, he owed 216 million yuan in private debts (including approximately 40 million yuan in wages owed to workers). However, Zhenyuan Coal Mine only had 155 tons of net coal in storage, plus machinery and equipment, totaling less than 100 million yuan in value. Most of the huge sums of money that Yuan defrauded from the state were used for speculative activities; more than 450 million yuan was used to pay off old debts or lend to private individuals. He also established "acquisition stations" to acquire coal from small mines, and evaded taxes on coal transportation, purchased salt and silver dollars; less than half of the loans were used for production.

The course of this case is as follows:

In January of last year, Liu Xiangsan, the former director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry, without clarifying the situation, requested the Provincial People's Government to order military control of Zhenyuan Coal Mine, and appointed Song Weijing, the military representative of the state-owned Nanling Coal Mine, to concurrently serve as the military representative of Zhenyuan Coal Mine. Song Weijing was only nominally at Zhenyuan Coal Mine, and she did not perform her concurrent duties.

In February of last year, Song Weijing, without investigating the situation of Zhenyuan Coal Mine, rashly wrote a letter introducing Yuan Jia Yao to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry to collect part of the advance payment for 600 tons of coal; she also wrote a letter introducing Yuan to obtain a loan of more than 260 million yuan from the National Bank.

In June of last year, Chen Shugu, manager of the Guangzhou branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as Coal Construction Company), actually certified to the bank for Yuan: "This mine is very much in line with economic policy and is of great help to public-owned enterprises." Zhu Jingzhi, director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce, without studying the matter, believed that Zhenyuan Coal Mine should be given "care" and instructed the Coal Construction Company to purchase 500 tons of coal to solve the mine's difficulties. Based on this instruction, Chen Shugu, without the approval of the Coal Construction Company's Central South Region Company, guaranteed to the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications to purchase 500 tons of coal from the mine, enabling Yuan to fraudulently obtain a loan of 225 million yuan. This loan was not repaid when due, and the Coal Construction Company did not fulfill its responsibilities as guarantor. In August of last year, when Yuan applied for a loan from the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications, Chen Shugu wrote a letter certifying: "This mine used to produce 3,000 tons per month, but currently produces 500-600 tons per month due to the blockage of the branch line (the Gouyadong branch line of the Yuehan Railway passes through the mine)." The loan application submitted by Zhenyuan Coal Mine stated that it had 3,000 tons of coal in storage. Mao Shaoyi, deputy director of the Local Industry Department of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry, without investigating this plan, certified to the bank: "The verification is still practical and has been agreed to," and without asking the director, guaranteed to the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications in the name of the department that 1,000 tons of coal would be delivered upon maturity, enabling Yuan to fraudulently obtain the fourth loan of 350 million yuan.

In August of last year, Chen Yongxiang, district chief of the Fifth District of Yizhang County, Hunan Province, and Li Yongfang of the CCP District Committee, without investigation and research, lent 500 dan of grain (principal and interest totaling approximately 36 million yuan) intended for peasant production and disaster relief to Yuan. This was not recovered for a long time, damaging the interests of the peasants.

Ding Zhaoji, director of the Business Department of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry, prepaid all the payments for 60,000 tons of coal from Zhenyuan Coal Mine; later, when Zhenyuan Coal Mine could not deliver the coal as agreed, no effective measures were taken. Lin Langtian, president of the Guangzhou branch of the People's Bank of China, approved four loans to Zhenyuan Coal Mine, only paying attention to the guarantee procedures, and did not conduct any investigation or supervision before or after the loans. He was not alert to Yuan's practice of borrowing large and repaying small, and failing to repay when due. Liu Gang, manager of the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications, continuously provided three loans totaling 900 million yuan to Zhenyuan Coal Mine, also only paying attention to the guarantee procedures, without sending anyone to the site for investigation and supervision, and did not raise an alarm about the long-term arrears and the practice of borrowing large and repaying small. When Yuan fraudulently obtained the fourth loan, after the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications obtained the guarantee from the Department of Industry, it wanted to send someone to the mine for investigation. Huang Ziliang, director of the Business Office of the South China branch of the People's Bank, and Zhao Yizeng, chief of the Deposit Section, criticized Chen Genrong, deputy manager of the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications, saying: "Since the Department of Industry is guaranteeing and controlling it, is it not more reliable than the bank controlling it?" The Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications then abandoned the intention of investigating. For this loan, Chen Shugu of the Coal Construction Company guaranteed to the Bank of Communications that if coal was shipped from Zhenyuan Mine, it would be purchased at the price and the money would be deducted and paid to the bank. However, Zhenyuan Coal Mine delivered two batches of coal successively, but still did not repay the loan. This aroused suspicion from the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications, which, together with the Provincial Department of Industry, sent people to the mine for investigation twice. Yuan made extensive arrangements in advance: buying new beds and new quilts, slaughtering chickens and ducks, and entertaining the investigators; temporarily gathering odd-job workers to pick coal; covering raw coal with pure coal; starting up motors that had never been started, holding a "production drill," and convening a "symposium" attended only by capitalists and senior staff to reflect false information. Because the investigators lacked experience and did not delve into the worker masses, they were deceived. However, they also discovered that the coal mine "owed a lot of money, the use of loans was unclear, the coal output was not high, and the ability to repay loans was problematic." At the end of December of last year, the Finance and Economic Committee of Lechang County, based on the results of the county People's Bank's understanding of Zhenyuan Mine, also pointed out in its report to the South China Finance and Economic Committee: "The mine is poorly managed, the equipment is simple, production is at a standstill, and it is heavily indebted and has insufficient ability to repay loans." However, these did not attract the attention of the South China Finance and Economic Committee and relevant departments. Later, Song Weijing discovered Yuan's fraudulent activities and reported to the Central Finance and Economic Committee and the Central South Finance and Economic Committee, which revealed this major fraud. However, even after Song Weijing exposed Yuan's fraud, in mid-January of this year, Mao Shaoyi, deputy director of the Local Industry Department of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry, still blindly assigned Zhenyuan Mine the production task of 8,000 tons for the whole year, and believed that "the problem is not big." Later, Yuan also submitted a plan to apply for an extension until July to repay the loan, and Mao Shaoyi still certified to the bank: "It is still practical, and it should be handled accordingly." This bureaucratic work style has simply reached its peak. On January 6, the Central Finance and Economic Committee instructed the South China Finance and Economic Committee to investigate and deal with the matter. The South China Finance and Economic Committee lacked a serious understanding of the unscrupulous merchants' fraudulent acquisition of national loans and the bureaucratic work style of cadres, and only reported the general situation to the Central Finance and Economic Committee, still blindly and mistakenly believing that "it is better to adopt the method of repaying the loan from production," without conducting an in-depth investigation.

In March of this year, the Central South Finance and Economic Committee requested the Central South People's Supervisory Committee to handle this issue jointly. The Central South People's Supervisory Committee notified the Guangdong Provincial People's Supervisory Committee to conduct an inspection, and in May of this year, sent personnel to join the Guangdong Provincial People's Supervisory Committee, the Provincial People's Procuratorate, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Central South China Bureau, the South China Finance and Economic Committee, and other units to form an inspection team to conduct a thorough inspection. After the inspection, the relevant personnel who neglected their duties have been decided to be punished as they deserve. (Our newspaper Wuhan reporter station)

    广东私营振源煤矿公司经理袁家尧
    九次骗取国家贷款进行投机活动
    广东工商主管部门某些领导干部官僚主义作风严重，放松了对奸商进行必要的防范和斗争。
    广东省私营振源煤矿公司经理袁家尧骗取国家巨额贷款的案件，已由中南军政委员会人民监察委员会检查完毕，处理办法已经由中南军政委员会批准。失职人员即将分别受到应得的处分；袁犯家尧已经被当地人民政府逮捕，并将受到法律制裁。
    袁家尧是个大骗子。一九四六年他在广东北部坪石水牛湾开煤行，一九四七年在伪广东省建设厅、当地地主恶霸及反动官僚的支持下，取得粤汉路狗牙洞支线上距坪石车站十四公里处的矿区的开采权，集股组织“振源煤矿公司”，袁犯任总经理。解放后，袁犯取得广州市煤业公会负责人的地位，并以“广东省私营煤矿代表”的资格，出席了中南和中央煤炭产销会议，到处招摇撞骗。他说振源煤矿解放前有职工六百多人，解放后有四百多人；但据后来调查，从来没有超过二百人。他吹嘘有存煤三千吨；但据后来调查，存煤最多时只有一千三百多吨，其中纯煤只有一百零一吨，其余一千多吨都是毛煤，经过洗选后只能得纯煤二、三成。他说振源煤矿每月最高产量是三千五百吨，又说一九五○年一月到五月平均月产一千吨以上；但据后来调查，在一九五○年一月到六月总共才产纯煤八百四十五吨，七月到十二月根本没有进行生产，一九五一年一月到四月只产纯煤一百七十七吨。他还吹嘘这个矿蕴藏量有一百万吨；其实，这个矿是土法开采的，从没有经过勘测。有些干部没有经过调查研究，就盲目地轻信了他这些胡说。
    袁犯从一九四九年十二月到一九五○年十二月，采取各种流氓手段，先后共骗取了国家的九次贷款，共计十四亿六千多万元。除以借大还小方式偿还了一部分并交了一部分煤以外，还拖欠十亿一千八百万元。此外，还拖欠私款二亿一千六百万元（包括欠工人的工资约四千万元）。可是，振源煤矿只存净煤一百五十五吨，加上机器设备等，总共值不到一亿元。袁犯骗去国家的巨款，大部分是用到投机性活动上了；四亿五千多万是用来还旧账或借给私人。他还设立了“收购站”，收购小矿煤炭；并运煤偷漏税款，购买食盐、银元；贷款用在生产上的不到一半。
    这个案件的经过情形是这样的：
    去年一月，广东省工业厅前任厅长刘向三没把情况弄清楚，就要求省人民政府下令对振源煤矿实行军管，委派国营南岭煤矿的军事代表宋维静兼任振源煤矿的军事代表。宋维静在振源煤矿只是挂名的，她并没有执行兼任的职务。
    去年二月，宋维静没有调查研究振源煤矿的情况，就贸然写信介绍袁家尧到广东省工业厅取预购煤六百吨的部分价款；她并且写信介绍袁犯到国家银行取得贷款二亿六千多万元。
    去年六月，中国煤业建筑器材公司（以下简称煤建公司）广州分公司经理陈树谷竟为袁犯向银行证明：“该矿甚合乎经济政策，对公营事业帮助很大”。广东省商业厅厅长朱竟之没有加以研究，就认为对振源煤矿须加“照顾”，就指示煤建公司收购煤五百吨解决该矿困难。陈树谷根据这个指示，没有经过煤建公司中南区公司批准，就向交通银行广州分行保证收购该矿煤五百吨，使袁犯骗到贷款二亿二千五百万元，这次贷款到期不还，煤建公司也没有履行保证人职责。去年八月，袁犯到交通银行广州分行贷款，陈树谷写信证明：“该矿过去月产三千吨，目前因支线（粤汉路狗牙洞支线经过该矿）不通，月产五、六百吨。”振源煤矿申请贷款的计划书，说明有存煤三千吨，广东省工业厅地方工业处副处长毛绍仪对这一计划书没经过调查，就向银行证明：“查核尚属切实，业经予以同意”，也没请示厅长，就以厅的名义，向交通银行广州分行保证到期交煤一千吨，使袁犯得以骗取第四次贷款三亿五千万元。
    去年八月，湖南省宜章县第五区区长陈永祥和中共区委李永芳，也没有经过调查研究，就把农民的生产救灾粮五百担谷（本息约合三千六百万元）借给袁犯。长期收不回来，使农民利益受到损害。
    广东省工业厅经理处处长丁兆麒预购振源煤矿六万吨煤，随便把全部价款付清；后来振源煤矿不能如约交煤，也没有作有效措施。中国人民银行广州分行行长林朗天，前后批准了四次对振源煤矿的贷款，只注意有担保手续，贷款前后都没有进行调查和监督，对袁犯的借大还小，到期不还，都没有警惕。交通银行广州分行经理刘刚，连续给振源煤矿贷款三次，总数九亿元，也是只注意了担保手续，没有派人到现场调查、监督，对贷款的长期拖欠和借大还小未加警惕。当袁犯骗取第四次贷款时，交通银行广州分行在得到工业厅的保证后，想派人去矿上调查，人民银行华南分行业务室主任黄子良及存放科科长赵颐增就批评交通银行广州分行副经理陈根荣说：“既有工业厅来保证和掌握，难道会比银行来掌握靠不住吗？”交通银行广州分行就打消了调查的意图。这次贷款，煤建公司陈树谷向交通银行保证，如振源矿有煤运来，当按价收购，将款扣交银行。但振源煤矿先后交煤两批，仍没有还款。这引起了交通银行广州分行的怀疑，就会同该省工业厅两次派人到矿上调查。袁犯事先大加布置：买新床新被，杀鸡宰鸭，招待调查人员；临时召集散工挑煤；用纯煤盖在毛煤上；把从来没开动过的电机开动起来，举行“生产大演习”，召开只有资方和高级职员参加的“座谈会”，反映假情况。因调查人员经验不足，又没有深入工人群众，就受了蒙蔽。但也发现这个煤矿“欠债多，借款用途不明，出煤不多，还款能力有问题”。去年十二月底、乐昌县财政经济委员会根据县人民银行去振源矿了解的结果，给华南财政经济委员会的报告中也指出：“该矿经营不善，设备简陋，生产陷于停顿状态，且负债累累，还款能力不足。”但这些都没有引起华南财政经济委员会和各有关部门的注意。后来宋维静发现袁犯有骗款行为，向中央财政经济委员会及中南财政经济委员会作了报告，才把这个大骗局揭发出来。可是，就在宋维静揭发袁犯骗局后，今年一月中旬，广东省工业厅地方工业处副处长毛绍仪仍然盲目分配给振源矿全年八千吨的生产任务，并且认为“问题不大”。后袁犯又提出申请展期至七月还款的计划，毛绍仪仍向银行证明：“尚属切实，应请予以照办。”这种官僚主义的作风，简直到了顶点。一月六日，中央财政经济委员会指令华南财政经济委员会查明处理。华南财政经济委员会对奸商骗取国家贷款和干部官僚主义作风的严重认识不足，只把一般情况报告中央财政经济委员会，仍然盲目地错误地认为“只好采取从生产中还款的办法”，没有深入检查。
    今年三月，中南财政经济委员会转请中南人民监察委员会，协同处理这个问题。中南人民监察委员会就通知广东省人民监察委员会进行检查，并在今年五月，派员会同广东省人民监察委员会、省人民检察署、中共中央华南分局纪律检查委员会、华南财政经济委员会等单位，组成检查组，进行了彻底的检查。经过检查，已对有关失职人员，决定了应受的处分。（本报武汉记者站）
