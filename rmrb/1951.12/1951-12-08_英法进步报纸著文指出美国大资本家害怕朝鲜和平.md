Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 6th. The London "Daily Worker" published an essay by Holmes on November 30th, titled "America's Peace Panic." Holmes said: "Not only are American officers alarmed by the 'soldiers' peace' in Korea, but domestic industrial and commercial tycoons are also alarmed by the possible success of peace."
    Holmes quoted some headlines and lead-ins from the "New York Times" a few days ago as follows:
    "Stock prices have fallen again - the biggest drop since November 7th."
    "Brokers believe that due to the possible armistice in Korea, Wall Street professionals have retreated to the sidelines again."
    "The Korean truce plan caused a sharp drop in grain prices."
    "Chicago, November 23rd, news - It is reported that the Korean armistice negotiation representatives reached a temporary agreement on the buffer zone issue today. Coincidentally, many small-scale speculators in various food markets made the market appear weak..."
    Holmes finally said: "There is no doubt that the interests of the financial groups in the military industry are a major factor in undermining the negotiations of these months."
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 6th. Paris News: The French "L'Humanité" published a commentary on November 30th saying: The news on November 29th about reaching an agreement on the "cease-fire line" caused great panic among American industrialists and businessmen.
    "L'Humanité" said: In the stock exchanges of New York, London, Antwerp and other places, the securities prices of strategic materials, especially materials such as tin, rubber, and wool, have also fallen sharply. People can gain a better understanding of the attitude of the U.S. representatives at the armistice negotiation conference from this reaction.

    英法进步报纸著文指出美国大资本家害怕朝鲜和平
    【新华社布拉格六日电】伦敦“工人日报”在十一月三十日刊出了荷姆斯所写的论文，题目是“美国的和平恐慌”。荷姆斯说：“不仅美国的军官因在朝鲜的‘士兵的和平’而感到惊慌，国内的工业和商业大王也因和平可能成功而感到恐慌。”
    荷姆斯引述了几天前“纽约时报”的一些标题和导语如下：
    “股票价格又发生新的跌落——十一月七日以来最大的下跌。”
    “经纪人认为，由于朝鲜可能停战，华尔街的专业人员又退到一边去了。”
    “朝鲜休战计划使粮价大跌。”
    “芝加哥十一月二十三日消息——传朝鲜休战谈判代表今天已就缓冲区问题获致暂时的协议，恰恰与此同时，各粮食市场作小股投机生意的很多，这两件事使市场呈现疲弱现象……”
    荷姆斯最后说：“毫无疑问，财阀在军事工业中的利益，是破坏这几个月的谈判的一个大因素。”
    【新华社布拉格六日电】巴黎消息：法国“人道报”十一月三十日发表评论说：十一月二十九日关于“停火线”获得协议的消息，这在美国工商业人士中间引起了很大的惊慌。
    “人道报”说：纽约、伦敦、安特卫普等地的证券交易所中，战略物资的证券价格，特别是锡、橡胶、羊毛等物资的价格，也大大下跌了。人们从这种反应上看，就会对美方代表在停战谈判会议上的态度有更好的了解。
