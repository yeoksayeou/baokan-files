"Chinese Health Magazine" Poisons Readers

To the Editor: To ensure that our comrades pay attention to their health, our organization subscribed to the "Chinese Health Magazine" (edited by Yu Xin'en, published by the Chinese Health Association) at the Xinhua Bookstore. This magazine, which has been published for twelve years, is a very bad magazine. It openly promotes the "American way of life" and vulgar bourgeois tastes. Taking only the materials from this year's January to October issues (Volume 13, Issues 1 to 10) as an example:

First of all, the logo printed on the cover is intolerable. The cover indicates the magazine's four major guidelines, with four accompanying pictures: "1. Raise Hygiene Standards (picture of a foreign strongman lifting weights); 2. Encourage Research Work (picture of a foreign doctor holding a diploma); 3. Convey New Medical Knowledge (picture of a naked foreign woman doing leg exercises); 4. Pay Attention to Mental Health (picture of three cartoonish foreign characters fishing)." It is not difficult to see here what direction the editors want to "raise," "encourage," "convey," and "pay attention to"; nor is it difficult to see what lifestyle the editors admire.

Let's look at the content. The first aspect is the introduction of "medical" knowledge and "research" articles. The vast majority of these articles are translated from British and American magazines, and the content mainly includes: 1. Advertising British and American drugs; the magazine itself seems to be an advertisement or promotional material for foreign pharmacies; 2. Promoting the British and American way of life, such as in Volume 13, Issue 4, "Chewing and Working," which says: "We can also see typists often like to chew gum while typing"; 3. Promoting the British and American "philosophy of life," such as in Volume 13, Issue 9, "The Reward of Diligence and Politeness," which says how a businessman understood how to flatter and be "harmonious and polite," and finally achieved "success." In short, this part of the material is all about American and British affairs, American and British medicine, American and British living habits, which are so far from "Chinese Health"! The second aspect is articles related to "healthy psychology." These articles are almost all spreading American "tastes." For example, an article in Volume 13, Issue 5, titled "Clinic Oddities," is a genuine American yellow journalism story, the most absurd and boring. This type of article appears in every issue, such as women not wanting to talk about their age, a mental patient breaking into a female doctor's bedroom at midnight, a mysterious letter curing someone who went insane due to the death of their son...

In addition, most of its filler texts are low-level jokes of the "laugh or don't laugh" type from past American magazines, which are even more utterly boring!

In the three great patriotic movements of resisting America, aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the political awareness of medical workers across the country has generally improved. Many people have incorporated the elimination of erroneous viewpoints into their patriotic pledges, and many have even gone to the front lines to directly serve the soldiers. This is the most glorious event in the medical field. However, "Chinese Health Magazine" is promoting the so-called "American way of life," poisoning people's ideological health. For such magazines that are connected with imperialist ideology, we hope that the medical community and relevant departments will pay serious attention.

### “中华健康杂志”毒害读者

    “中华健康杂志”毒害读者
    编辑同志：我们机关为了使同志们注意身体健康，在新华书店订了一份“中华健康杂志”（余新恩编辑、中华健康协会发行）。这个杂志已经出版了十二年了，是一个非常恶劣的杂志。它公开宣扬“美国生活方式”和庸俗的资产阶级趣味。只拿今年一月号到十月号（十三卷一期到十期）的材料来说吧：
    首先，印在封面上的标志，看了就叫人不能容忍。封面上标明着这个杂志的四大方针，还附有四幅图画：“一、提高卫生水准（图画是一个外国大力士在举重）；二、鼓励研究工作（图画是一个手拿文凭的外国博士）；三、传达医学新知（图画是一个外国裸体的女人在做腿部运动）；四、注意心理健康（图画是三个漫画式的外国人物在钓鱼）”。这里已经不难看出，编者所要“提高”、“鼓励”、
    “传达”、“注意”的方向在那里；也不难看出，编者所恋慕的生活方式是什么了。
    我们来看内容吧。第一方面，是介绍“医学”知识和“研究”性的文章。这一类的文章极大部分是从英美杂志翻译来的，内容主要是：一、为英美药品作宣传，这本杂志本身好像就是外国药房的广告或宣传品；二、为英美的生活方式作宣传，如十三卷四期“嚼食与工作”中说：“我们也可看到打字员常喜在打字时嚼口香糖”；三、为英美的“处世哲学”作宣传，如十三卷九期“勤劳有礼的酬报”中，说一个商人怎样懂得曲意奉承、“融和有礼”，终于获得了“成功”。总之，在这一部分材料中都是谈的美英的事、美英的药、美英的生活习惯，和“中华健康”不知差了多远！第二方面，是属于“健康心理”方面的文章。这一类文章，几乎都是散布美国“趣味”的东西。比方十三卷五期中有一篇题目叫“诊所奇事”的文章，就是道地的美国黄色新闻中最荒诞无聊的故事。这一类文章每期都有，如女人不爱谈自己的岁数，精神病患者午夜闯进女医生的卧室，一封神秘的信治好了一个因死掉儿子而精神失常的人……。
    此外，它的绝大部分补白文字，都是过去在美国杂志中属于“笑不笑由你”一类的低级玩意，更加无聊透顶！
    在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大爱国运动中，全国的医务工作者在政治觉悟上普遍提高，很多人都把清除错误观点订入爱国公约里，并有很多人更走上前线直接为战士们效劳，这是医务界的最光荣的一件大事。但“中华健康杂志”却在宣扬所谓“美国生活方式”，毒害人民的思想健康。对于这样和帝国主义思想有联系的杂志，希望医务界和有关部门加以严重注意。　孟　驰读报组活动
