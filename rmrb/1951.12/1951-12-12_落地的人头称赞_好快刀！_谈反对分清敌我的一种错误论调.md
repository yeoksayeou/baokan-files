    The ideological remolding movement for teachers in universities and colleges in Beijing and Tianjin is underway and has already achieved great results. However, it is said that during discussions on delineating enemy-friend positions, some people say: "If the enemy's gun is indeed well-made, then even if he uses this gun to kill me, I will still praise the gun as good."

    "Good" is indeed "good," but one is killed by it. Since one is killed, it is impossible to praise it, even if one wanted to. Therefore, this gentleman's logic is inappropriate. There is a story in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" that is somewhat similar to this situation. This story says: A person had his head chopped off, but because the knife was so fast, the head shouted "What a fast blade!" as it fell to the ground. Although this story sounds interesting, it can only be considered a "strange tale"; because, in reality, this is either lying or nonsense.

    This gentleman defends himself by saying: "I am not saying that a person will praise the gun after death, but rather that even if I might be killed by it, I will still 'objectively' praise it as good. Scientific advancement is always beneficial to mankind."

    The logic here is still inappropriate. First, since you think you might be killed by it, wouldn't it be better to try to prevent it from killing you? Why don't you think about taking the gun from the enemy's hands first, and then talk about whether the gun is good or bad? Why do you consider praising the gun as good more important than drawing a clear line between us and the enemy and opposing the enemy's violence? If everyone acted according to your opinion, not talking about position, not distinguishing between us and the enemy, but only praising the gun as good, and even thinking that losing one's head is a small matter, and praising the fast blade is a big matter, wouldn't that be too dangerous? Second, is scientific advancement beneficial to "mankind"? Unfortunately, this "mankind" includes both the vast majority of the people and the tiny minority of the people's enemies. Don't you realize what a threat it would be to all mankind if atomic science were completely in the hands of American imperialism? Natural science (not to mention the worldview and philosophical thought guiding it) serves all classes equally, but today when the enemy is so barbaric and cruel, are you willing to let your science serve them? Some gentlemen who advocate "science for science's sake" even today send scientific reports and papers to the research institutions of American imperialism. Aren't you afraid that your scientific reports will be shamefully stained with the sacred blood of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers?

    I remember Mr. Lu Xun ridiculed a type of person, saying that they grab their own hair and try to lift themselves into the air. The gentleman who talks so much about praising the enemy's gun even after death can also be compared to this type of person. He completely forgets that in this world, one must have a standpoint for everything one does and says. In today's world where the struggle between us and the enemy is so acute, if one does not firmly stand on the side of the people's interests, although one may think that one has lifted oneself into the air, one is actually unconsciously standing on the side of the people's enemies who are wielding guns and committing violence.

    落地的人头称赞“好快刀！”
    ——谈反对分清敌我的一种错误论调
    杨耳
    京津两地高等学校教师思想改造运动正在开展，已经获得很大成绩。但听说在讨论划分敌我立场时，有人说：“如果敌人的枪实在制造得好，那末，虽然他用这枝枪把我打死了，我还是要称赞这枝枪好。”
    “好”倒是“好”，可是自己却被它打死了。既然打死了，虽要称赞也就不可能了。所以，这位先生的逻辑是不妥当的。“聊斋志异”里有一则故事，和这里的情形有些相像。这个故事说：有一个人被人砍下了脑袋，因为刀太快，所以头落在地上还大嚷“好快刀！”这个故事听来虽很有趣，但是只能算是“志异”而已；因为，实际上这不是扯谎，就是扯淡罢了。
    这位先生辩解说：“我不是说人死之后还会称赞枪好，而是说，我即使可能被它打死，也还是要‘客观’地称赞它好。科学发达总是对人类有利益的。”
    这里的逻辑也还是不妥当。首先，你既然想到可能被它打死，难道设法不让它打死不是更好些吗？你为什么不想到先把这枝枪从敌人手里夺过来，再谈枪好枪坏呢？你为什么把称赞枪好，看得比划清敌我界限、反对敌人行凶还更重要些呢？如果大家都照你的意见办事，不谈立场，不分敌我，只是一味地称赞枪好，甚至认为人头落地事小，称赞刀快的事大，那不是太危险了么？其次，科学发达就对“人类”有利吗？可惜这个“人类”里既有占极大多数的人民，又有极少数的人民的敌人。你难道没有认识到如果原子科学完全掌握在美帝国主义手里将对全人类有什么威胁吗？自然科学（不谈指导它的世界观、哲学思想）是对各阶级一视同仁地服务的，可是今天敌人如此野蛮残忍，你也愿意把你的科学去为他们服务吗？有些主张“为科学而科学”的先生，甚至今天还把科学报告、论文寄到美帝国主义的研究机关去，你难道不怕在你的科学报告上，可耻地沾上朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军圣洁的血花吗？
    记得鲁迅先生嘲笑过一种人，说他们抓住自己的头发就想把自己提到半空中去。那位大谈死了也要称赞敌人枪好的先生也可以和这样一种人相比。他根本忘了人生在世，办事说话总要有个立足点。在现在敌我斗争如此尖锐的世界上，如果不坚决站在人民的利益上，虽然自己以为已经把自己提到了半空中，实际上就不知不觉地站在持枪行凶的人民敌人的立场上去了。
