    The Tendency of Some Middle and Primary School Teachers
    to Not Concern Themselves with Politics Should Be Corrected
    Editor: In many places, a considerable number of middle and primary school teachers do not fully recognize the importance of studying politics, showing a serious tendency to not concern themselves with politics. For example, in the political common sense test for middle and primary school teachers held by the Wenhua and Education Section of the Jiangyin County People's Government in Southern Jiangsu in late October, over 72% of the total number of test takers (one hundred and twenty-six people) failed. Some of these were very basic common sense questions, such as "List the names of the democratic countries in the world," "Who is the chief representative of our side in the Korean armistice negotiations? Who is the chief representative of the U.S. side?" and "What are the main tasks of the People's Government in culture and education?" More than half of the teachers could not answer them, and only one person answered the third question correctly. The answers to the first question contained many errors, with some listing Indonesia, India, Iran, etc., as democratic countries, and others listing Xinjiang, Tibet, and Paris as countries. Those who answered these questions incorrectly even included middle school teachers of Chinese language, history, and geography. A similar tendency to not concern themselves with politics also exists seriously among teachers in primary schools in Gangu County, Gansu, and in the middle and primary schools affiliated with the Northwest Railway Mainline Engineering Bureau. Although the results of current affairs and political tests cannot be taken as the main basis for judging a person's political level, they do indeed reveal some problems. I believe that education departments at the provincial level and below should, in this great movement of ideological remolding, also adopt appropriate and effective measures to strengthen the political study and ideological remolding of middle and primary school teachers, overcome the tendency to not concern themselves with politics, so that they gradually become suitable for the needs of school education in the People's China, and strive to become good people's teachers.

### 某些中、小学教职员不问政治的倾向应改正

    某些中、小学教职员
    不问政治的倾向应改正
    编辑同志：各地不少中、小学教职员，还不完全认识学习政治的重要性，表现了严重的不问政治的倾向。例如苏南江阴县人民政府文教科在十月下旬举行的中、小学教职员政治常识测验中，不及格的就占总数（一百二十六人）的百分之七十二强。其中有些是很普通的常识题，如对“列举世界各民主国家的名称。”“朝鲜停战谈判我方的首席代表是谁？美方的首席代表是谁？”“人民政府的文化教育的主要任务是什么？”等题，竟有半数以上的教职员答不来，而答对第三题的仅有一人。对第一题的答案，错误很多，有的竟把印尼、印度、伊朗等都列在民主国家之内，还有的把新疆、西藏、巴黎也列成一个国家。答错这些问题的，还有中学的国文、史地教员。类似这种不问政治的倾向，在甘肃甘谷县各小学和西北铁路干线工程局所属各中、小学的教师中，也同样严重地存在着。虽然时事政治测验的结果，不能作为判断一个人政治水平的主要根据，但从这里也的确可以看出一些问题。我认为，各省级以下的教育工作部门，在这次思想改造的大运动中，也应采取适当而有效的办法，加强中、小学教职员的政治学习和思想改造工作，克服不问政治的倾向，使他们逐渐适合于人民中国的学校教育的需要，并为争取做一个良好的人民教师而努力。
