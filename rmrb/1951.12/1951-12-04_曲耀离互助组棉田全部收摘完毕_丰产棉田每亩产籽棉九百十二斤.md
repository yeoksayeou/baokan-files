Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd—The cotton fields of the famous Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team in Shanxi Province were completely harvested last month. Qu Yaoli's two mu of high-yield cotton fields actually produced 912 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is 167 jin more than the highest yield of 745 jin per mu he created last year. This year, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team planted a total of 48 mu of cotton (including 6 mu of cotton fields that could not be irrigated, resulting in lower yields), and harvested a total of 26,344 jin of seed cotton, with an average yield of 548 jin and 13 liang per mu, exceeding last year's average yield by more than 112 percent. Among them, Qu Yaoli's 20 mu (all of which could be irrigated) harvested a total of 15,202 jin of seed cotton, with an average of 760 jin per mu, which is 15 jin more than his highest yield last year. The cotton fields of another member of the mutual aid team, Gao Jindong, averaged 633 jin per mu. When the cotton harvesting began, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team estimated that 48 mu of cotton fields could harvest 26,160 jin of seed cotton. Now, the actual harvest exceeds this estimate. Qu Yaoli's two mu of high-yield cotton fields were initially estimated to yield more than 830 jin of seed cotton per mu. Later, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government estimated, based on on-the-spot inspections, that each mu could yield 920 jin of seed cotton. The current actual harvest figure is not far from the second estimate, and greatly exceeds the first estimate. As for the specimens sent to the exhibition and to farmers from various places who visited Qu Yaoli's cotton fields, the number is also considerable and has not been included in the calculations.

    曲耀离互助组棉田全部收摘完毕
    丰产棉田每亩产籽棉九百十二斤
    【新华社太原三日电】山西省著名的曲耀离互助组的棉田，已在上月全部收摘完毕。曲耀离的二亩丰产棉田每亩实产籽棉九百一十二斤，比他去年创造的棉田最高产量七百四十五斤多一百六十七斤。曲耀离互助组今年共种棉花四十八亩（内有六亩棉田不能浇灌，产量较低），共收籽棉二万六千三百四十四斤，每亩平均产五百四十八斤十三两，超过去年平均产量百分之一百一十二强。其中，曲耀离的二十亩（都能浇灌）共收籽棉一万五千二百零二斤，每亩平均七百六十斤，比他去年的最高产量多十五斤。互助组另一组员高进东的棉田，每亩平均六百三十三斤。开始收摘棉花时，曲耀离互助组估计四十八亩棉田可摘籽棉二万六千一百六十斤。现在，实际收获超过了这个估计。曲耀离的二亩丰产棉田，最初估计每亩可摘籽棉八百三十多斤，以后，中央人民政府农业部根据实地考察估计每亩可摘九百二十斤籽棉。现在的实际收获数字和第二个估计相差不远，大大超过了第一个估计。至于送给展览会以及各地到曲耀离棉田参观的农民的标本，数目也不少，都没有计算在内。
