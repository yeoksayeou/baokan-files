Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th — On November 20th, the Liang Zaijie Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army engaged in a fierce battle with enemy aircraft for over an hour, achieving a brilliant victory of shooting down five enemy planes without suffering any casualties themselves. At 1:00 PM that day, eight American invading army F80 fighter planes penetrated the airspace near the anti-aircraft artillery position of the Liang Zaijie Unit. After emerging from the clouds, they attacked a bridge near the position. As the enemy planes dove, they were met with fierce anti-aircraft fire from the ground, and the enemy planes immediately panicked and flew away. However, a few minutes later, sixteen enemy fighters arrived. The enemy planes attempted to destroy the anti-aircraft artillery position. The anti-aircraft gunners of the Liang Zaijie Unit calmly and accurately fired at the arrogant enemy planes. The brave soldiers disregarded the explosions of bombs around them, focusing on shooting down the enemy planes. Soon, an enemy plane was hit by a shell from the second gun of a certain company of the unit while diving, and immediately crashed and burned. A burst of cheers erupted on the position. Subsequently, several enemy planes suddenly dove again, and one of them frantically dropped a bomb and climbed upwards. At this moment, a shell from the fourth gun of a certain company hit its belly. The enemy plane, smoking heavily, wobbled and fell straight down. Then, a shell from the second gun of a certain company also hit another diving enemy plane. The enemy planes circling in the high altitude were now afraid to fly low and dive, flying higher and higher until they disappeared. However, the brave soldiers on the anti-aircraft artillery position still vigilantly watched the sky, deploying their firepower to the direction from which the enemy planes might return. Sure enough, before long, the enemy planes flew over the anti-aircraft artillery position again. At this time, the anti-aircraft gunners immediately unleashed fierce artillery fire. The leading enemy plane was hit and crashed by the third gun of a certain company; another enemy plane was also accurately shot down by the brave soldiers when it entered the firing range of the third gun of a certain company.

    朝人民军梁载杰高射炮区分队一次击落敌机五架
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】十一月二十日，朝鲜人民军某高射炮部队梁载杰区分队和敌机激战一个多小时，取得了击落敌机五架而自己无一伤亡的光辉胜利。当天下午一时，美国侵略军F80型战斗机八架侵入梁载杰区分队高射炮阵地附近上空后，穿出云层，对该阵地附近的某大桥进行袭击。敌机一俯冲下来，就遭到地面高射炮火的猛烈射击，敌机顿时慌乱地高飞逃命。但在几分钟后，敌战斗机十六架飞来了。敌机企图摧毁这个高射炮阵地。梁载杰区分队的高射炮手们沉着地向狂妄的敌机进行准确的射击。勇士们不管炸弹在周围爆炸，一心想把敌机打下几架来。不久，一架敌机在俯冲时被该区分队某中队第二门炮的炮弹击中，立即坠地焚毁。阵地上立刻响起了一阵阵的欢呼声。随后好几架敌机又突然俯冲下来，其中一架敌机慌乱地扔了一个炸弹后就往上钻。正在这时，某中队第四门炮飞出一颗炮弹击中了它的腹部。敌机冒着浓烟摇摇摆摆地直掉下来。接着，某中队第二门炮的一颗炮弹也击中了另一架俯冲下来的敌机。在高空盘旋的敌机，这时都不敢低飞俯冲，越飞越高地不见踪迹了。但是高射炮阵地上的勇士们却仍旧警惕地注视着天空，对准敌机可能再来的方向布置了火力。果然，没有多久，敌机又飞到高射炮阵地的上空。这时，高射炮手们立即发出猛烈的炮火。最前面的一架敌机被某中队第三门炮击中落地；另一架敌机一进入某中队第三门炮的火力圈时，也被勇士们准确的炮火击落了。
