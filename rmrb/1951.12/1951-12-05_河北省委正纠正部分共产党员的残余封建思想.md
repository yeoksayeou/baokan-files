    Hebei Provincial Party Committee Correcting Remnant Feudal Ideas Among Some Communist Party Members
    By our special correspondent Dong Dong
    Over the past year, Hebei Province has made achievements in implementing the Marriage Law. In the old liberated areas, most young men and women have basically obtained freedom of marriage. According to statistics from seven districts in Renqiu and Qingxian counties and Bozhen town over the past six months, 518 people have freely married. According to statistics from 127 cities, towns, and counties, a total of 46,641 marriage cases were handled from May of last year to June of this year. The implementation of the Marriage Law has played a significant role in promoting production. However, in some areas, the implementation of the Marriage Law is still far from adequate. One of the important reasons is that some Communist Party members have remnant feudal ideas, hindering the implementation of the Marriage Law.
    In some rural areas, a common erroneous argument among Party members is that implementing the Marriage Law will lead to “chaos in the world.” They consciously or unconsciously fear that the dominance of “male power” will be shaken. They believe that women are “appendages” of men, and advocating equality between men and women “can only be regarded as an empty slogan.” Some Party members created the “theory” that “‘freedom’ should start from other people's families first,” opposing the implementation of the Marriage Law by their relatives. Some Party members even openly oppose the Marriage Law. For example, the Party branch secretary of Dongtun Village in Enxian County shouted on the street: “No one in our village can get divorced, and anyone who gets divorced will have their legs broken!” Some village Party members say: “Whoever gets divorced is a worn-out shoe, good people don't get divorced!” When these methods cannot stop women from firmly demanding freedom of marriage, Party members in the village government use the method of not issuing letters of introduction to obstruct them. A woman in Baijiayuan Village, Yiqu District, Xinle County, requested a divorce, but the village cadres refused to write a letter of introduction (because the woman's brother-in-law was the village Party branch secretary). She went to the district government twice, but the district government did not handle it. As a result, the woman was forced to hang herself and die. There are also many Party member cadres working in the district government who conduct forced mediation for women seeking divorce, favoring the man, both persuading and scaring, and driving the women back home. Some Party members also hold so-called "poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoints," using the pretext of safeguarding the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers to suppress women's freedom of marriage.
    Some local Party committees abuse their power and use Party discipline to obstruct the freedom of marriage for men and women. Comrade Mou, the director of the Women's Federation of Donghuaishu Village, Cixian County (a Party member), has had no feelings for her husband for more than ten years of marriage. When rectifying the Party, she requested a divorce and was expelled from the Party by the district committee. Zhao Zhongchen, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of Baotou Village, Erqu District, Daming County, is also a Party propagandist. He fell in love with Comrade Mou (female), the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. The Party members in the village disapproved and, after common discussion, removed him from his posts as secretary of the Communist Youth League branch and propagandist. Even the medals and prizes he had won in the past were taken back. These Party member cadres with feudal ideas describe the legitimate love affairs of young men and women as "engaging in improper relationships between men and women." Some village Party member cadres even force couples who are in love to parade through the streets, seriously violating human rights. Xue Jincui, a woman from Zhongkou Village, Baxian County, was originally in love with Zhang San from her village. Her brother, Xue Yong'an, thought it was "shameful" and forced her to get engaged to Xing Erhei from Cuijiabao Village. Jincui disagreed and was locked up by Xue Yong'an. Wang Xun, the secretary of the village Communist Party branch, and Wang Duo (Party member), the village chief, even convened a meeting of the village Party branch committee and village cadres, making the erroneous decision not to allow Xue Jincui to marry Zhang San. After the district government investigated and verified the truth, it allowed Jincui to break off the engagement with Xing Erhei. Xue Yong'an refused to accept this and deliberately made things difficult for Zhang San. Zhang San had no choice but to report to the district government. The district government summoned Xue Jincui and Xue Yong'an's mother to the district government, and Wang Xun wrote a letter to the district government falsely accusing Jincui and Zhang San of having improper relationships between men and women." Liu Fuyi, the civil affairs assistant in charge of handling this case, also did not support the correct love affair between Jincui and Zhang San because he held feudal ideas. In April of this year, Jincui was finally forced to marry Xing Erhei and committed suicide by jumping into a well shortly thereafter.
    Some county Party committees use the excuse of "internal affairs of the people" to delay or refuse to handle cases of women's suicide or murder. A woman in Mengzhuang Village, Yutian County, was murdered. The County Women's Federation requested that the murderer be punished, but the county Party committee refused to lead the handling of this case under the pretext of "being busy suppressing counter-revolutionaries," and wrongly criticized the County Women's Federation for "not having a class stand." They do not understand that although the issue is an internal matter of the people, the nature of the issue is anti-feudal. Some Party member cadres in the Women's Federation are very weak in their struggle and cannot adhere to the truth.
    The departmentalism of some Party member cadres also affects the implementation of the Marriage Law. They fear that if women from their village marry into other villages, they will take away the land of their village and make it difficult for the men in their village to find wives. Therefore, they come up with various ways to obstruct women from leaving the village. Zhang Zhao's widow, a widow from Shangang Village, Diqiqu District, Qian'an County, requested to remarry. The Party member cadres in the village said: "If you want to marry, you must marry a cadre from this village." They colluded with the district cadres and detained Zhang Zhao for two days. Some Party member cadres in mountainous areas do not allow women from their village to marry into plain areas, on the grounds that: "There are already few women in the mountains, and women from outside the mountains are unwilling to marry here. How can the men in the mountains find wives?"
    Due to the remnant feudal ideas and various incorrect views of some Party member cadres, the implementation of the Marriage Law has been greatly hindered. In the first half of this year alone, the number of cases of women being killed or forced to commit suicide due to marriage problems in Tangshan Prefecture reached 128. The occurrence of these tragic events is inseparable from the fact that some Party member cadres have feudal ideas and have failed to earnestly lead the masses in carrying out a resolute struggle against the feudal marriage system.
    At present, the system of buying and selling marriages or disguised buying and selling marriages still exists in many areas. Some farmers use their daughters to repay debts, and some areas call unmarried women "thousand-jin ladies" (referring to the fact that a woman can be sold for a thousand jin of grain). In some places, marrying off a daughter is called "a water buffalo entering the door" (referring to the fact that the money from selling a daughter can be used to buy a water buffalo). Women do not yet have independent personalities and live a life of slavery. Some Party member cadres turn a blind eye to these barbaric phenomena, and even promote this trend and suppress women.
    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has paid serious attention to this and has held special discussions, issued instructions, and decided to launch a study of the Marriage Law among Party members, and to carry out in-depth ideological struggle to eliminate the remnant feudal ideas among Party members and correctly implement the Marriage Law.

### 河北省委正纠正部分共产党员的残余封建思想

    河北省委正纠正部分共产党员的残余封建思想
    本报特约记者  董东
    一年多以来，河北省在贯彻执行婚姻法方面是有成绩的。在老解放区，大部分青年男女已基本上获得婚姻自由。据任邱、青县的七个区和泊镇半年来的统计，已有五百一十八人自由结婚。据一百二十七个市、镇、县的统计，从去年五月至今年六月，共处理了四万六千六百四十一起婚姻案件。执行婚姻法的结果，在生产方面起了很大的推动作用。但是，在部分地区，婚姻法的贯彻执行还是非常不够的。重要的原因之一是部分共产党员存在着封建思想残余，阻碍了婚姻法的贯彻执行。
    在部分农村中，党员较普遍的错误论调是实行婚姻法就会“天下大乱”。他们自觉或不自觉地怕“男权”统治发生动摇。他们认为妇女是男人的“附属品”，提倡男女平等“只能当作空洞的口号”。有的党员制造了“‘自由’先从别家起”的“理论”，反对自己的亲属实行婚姻法。有的党员更明目张胆地反对婚姻法。如恩县东屯村党支部书记在街上大喊：“咱村谁也不能离婚，谁离婚打断谁的腿！”有些村的党员说：“谁离婚谁是破鞋，好人不离婚！”当这些办法不能阻止妇女坚决要求婚姻自由时，村政权中的党员就用不开介绍信的办法来横加阻挠。新乐县一区白家园村一个妇女要求离婚，因村干部不给写介绍信（原因是该妇女婆家的哥哥是村支部书记），两次到区政府去，区政府都没有给处理。结果该妇女被迫上吊而死。还有不少在区政府工作的党员干部，对于要求离婚的妇女进行强制调解，偏袒男方，连劝带吓，把妇女赶回家去。有些党员还有着所谓“贫雇观点”，藉口维护贫农、雇农利益，压制妇女的婚姻自由。
    有些地方的党委滥用职权，以党的纪律来阻挠男女婚姻自由。磁县东槐树村的妇联主任某同志
    （党员），结婚十多年来，和丈夫始终没有感情。整党时她要求离婚，被区委开除了党籍。大名县二区包头村青年团支部书记赵忠臣，又是党的宣传员。他和青年团支部副书记某同志（女）恋爱。村中的党员看不惯，经过共同商议，撤消了他的青年团支部书记和宣传员的职务。连他过去所得的奖章和奖品也都收了回去。这些有封建思想的党员干部，把青年男女的正当恋爱说成“搞不正确的男女关系”。有些村的党员干部甚至强迫正在恋爱的男女游街，严重地侵犯了人权。霸县中口村妇女薛金翠原来和本村的张三恋爱，她哥哥薛永安认为“丢脸”，强迫她和崔家堡村的邢二黑订婚。金翠不同意，被薛永安锁押起来。该村中共支部书记王勋、村长王铎
    （党员）竟召开村支部委员会及村干部会，作出不许薛金翠和张三结婚的错误决定。后经区政府查明真象，允许金翠和邢二黑退婚。薛永安不服，寻故和张三为难，张三无奈，告到区政府。区政府把薛金翠、薛永安的母亲传到区政府，王勋又写信给区政府诬蔑金翠和张三有不正确的男女关系”。负责处理这个案子的民政助理员刘福义因为存在着封建思想，对金翠和张三的正确恋爱也不加支持。今年四月，金翠终于被迫和邢二黑结婚，不久投井自杀。
    有的县委以“人民内部的事情”为藉口，拖延或拒绝处理妇女自杀、被杀案件。玉田县孟庄一妇女被杀，县民主妇女联合会要求惩办凶手，县委藉口
    “镇压反革命忙”拒绝领导处理这一案件，并且错误地批评县民主妇女联合会“没有阶级立场”。他们不懂得：问题虽是人民内部的问题，但问题的性质却是反封建的性质。在民主妇女联合会中的党员干部，有些人斗争性很弱，也不能坚持真理。
    某些党员干部中的本位主义思想，同样影响了婚姻法的贯彻执行。他们怕本村妇女嫁到外村，会带走本村土地，还会使本村男人找不到老婆。因此他们想出种种办法来阻挠妇女出村。迁安县第七区山港村寡妇张赵氏要求改嫁，村里的党员干部说：“要嫁得嫁给本村的干部。”并和区干部串通一气，把张赵氏扣押了两天。山区里的某些党员干部，不许本村妇女嫁到平原地区去，理由是：“山里的妇女本来就少，山外的妇女又不愿嫁到这里来，山里的男人怎能找得上老婆？”
    由于部分党员干部有着残余的封建思想和种种不正确的观点，使婚姻法的贯彻受到极大阻碍。今年上半年，妇女因婚姻问题被杀或被逼自杀的案件仅唐山专区竟达到一百二十八件。这些惨痛事件的发生，是和部分党员干部存在着封建思想，未能认真领导群众向封建婚姻制度进行坚决斗争分不开的。
    目前，不少地区还存在着买卖婚姻制度或变相的买卖婚姻。有的农民用女儿顶债，有的地区称未婚妇女为“千金（斤）小姐”（指一个妇女可以卖一千斤粮食），有的地方把闺女出嫁称为“黄牛进门”（指卖女儿的钱可以买进一头黄牛）。妇女还没有独立的人格，过着奴隶式的生活。部分党员干部对这些野蛮现象熟视无睹，甚至助长这种风气，压制妇女。
    中共河北省委员会对此已严重注意，并已作了专门讨论，发出指示，决定在党员中展开婚姻法的学习，深入开展思想斗争，以肃清党员中残存的封建思想，正确贯彻执行婚姻法。
