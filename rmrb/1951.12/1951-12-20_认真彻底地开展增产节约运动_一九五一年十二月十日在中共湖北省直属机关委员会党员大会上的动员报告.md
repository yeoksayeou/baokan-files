Comrades,

Since Chairman Mao called on us to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," this movement has been vigorously launched in Beijing, the Northeast, and other places. However, a few of our comrades are still turning a deaf ear, and some individual comrades are even impatient to listen and unwilling to listen anymore. These comrades do not yet sufficiently recognize the great political significance of this movement. The increase production and practice economy movement is of great importance to the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, accumulating funds for national defense construction and economic construction, continuing to stabilize prices, rescuing a group of cadres who are going downhill, purifying the organization, and strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. If this movement is launched seriously and thoroughly, it will surely promote the progress of all aspects of work and greatly improve work efficiency. The comrades present here all support Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao calls on us, new victories await us, and we should, under the responsibility of the leaders, with the entire Party taking action, and uniting the entire people to take action together, launch a broad, sustained, and mass-based increase production and practice economy movement.

While launching the increase production and practice economy movement, we must also resolutely launch a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Are there any corruption and waste among our organ cadres? Yes, the tendency of extravagance and waste is developing, and this tendency is still serious for individual units or individuals. The problem is that it has not yet been exposed. This requires our Party members to bravely expose it. In addition, some comrades have a saying: "This time, it is to rectify the leaders, and it has nothing to do with us general cadres!" This statement has some truth; but on the other hand, do all of our comrades have wasteful ideas? Yes, and it is quite common. These comrades should conduct self-examination in connection with their ideology. However, some of our responsible comrades have been more extravagant and wasteful in the past two years, from the responsible persons of the provincial party committee to the provincial-level organs. At present, the amount of corruption in provincial-level organs cannot be stated, and the amount of waste is also difficult to determine accurately. Everyone is competing to show off extravagance and waste, considering the ability to be extravagant and wasteful as "glory." For example, some comrades, seeing that a certain organ has issued some things not in accordance with the system, instead of standing on the Party's position to persuade or criticize them, use this as an excuse to run to the financial department or the leading comrades to threaten them, saying: "A certain organ has issued something, why don't we issue it!" This is worthy of attention and is the most dangerous kind of unhealthy trend. Some of our comrades who have lived on the supply system for a long time have this kind of wrong idea: "I have given everything to the Party, shouldn't I waste a little!" There are also some veteran cadres who believe: "I have contributed in the past, and now that we have won, shouldn't I spend a few more dollars!" It is good that these comrades "give everything to the Party," and the Party and the people have not forgotten the "contributions in the past." But if you use these as reasons to demand personal extravagance and waste, then that is wrong. We Communists participate in the revolution not as a business—taking ourselves as commodities to bargain with the Party. We should "be the first to worry about the troubles of the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures," and improve our personal lives on the basis of striving to improve the lives of all the people. Only then can we be called "made of special materials." According to the materials collected recently: Huangpi County spent a large sum of money to build a dance hall, but there are no electric lights in the county seat, so they dance all day long. How can they not be divorced from the masses and opposed by the masses! Yingcheng Gypsum Mine Company, according to the books, should have earned 13 billion yuan, but they thought they could spend the money as they pleased—building houses, entertaining guests, etc. As a result of extravagance and waste, only 3 billion yuan was actually left. A certain provincial company arbitrarily expanded its staff without regard to work needs. One company actually had 28 accountants. Not to mention the waste of manpower, these 28 people have nothing to do, so they formulate complicated procedures at all levels. These 28 people cannot remit 100 million yuan in a day. This kind of extravagance and waste corrupts the thinking of revolutionary personnel and corrupts the revolutionary organization. Where does this unhealthy trend come from? People's thoughts govern their actions. Objectively, we have won victory throughout the country, have large cities, and capitalist ideas are invading everywhere. Reflected in our revolutionary camp, some comrades with unhealthy thoughts are developing a mentality of taking credit and enjoying themselves, even becoming corrupt and degenerate. In the past, the provincial party committee did not sufficiently grasp the criticism and correction of this ideological tendency, and was only busy with the central tasks of suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies, reducing rent and interest, and land reform, forgetting or neglecting that the development of various tasks must first correct the thinking of cadres. This is the responsibility of the provincial party committee in terms of leadership. On the other hand, due to insufficient ideological leadership, bureaucracy took the opportunity to invade us. We received the Kuomintang's bureaucratic organs and also received some bureaucracy, more or less uncritically. Although it is not a matter of setting up positions for people in terms of the organization of the organs, our institutions are indeed bloated and huge. A certain company in Shashi can do the work with six people, but it has developed to 26 people, with 20 people idle. It is said that our provincial-level establishment exceeds the regulations by one-third. This is not enough. When the Provincial Establishment Committee solicited opinions from various organs on reducing the establishment in October, everyone proposed to increase it by several thousand more. These comrades only see that every staff member is very busy, extremely busy, especially the typists who shout "I am busy all day long." We must check what everyone is busy with! It cannot be denied that some things that should be done are being done; it also cannot be denied that some things that are dispensable or completely unnecessary, and even harmful when done, are indeed being done, making the working comrades below dizzy, and just looking at official documents, instructions, etc. is overwhelming. For example, in the past, the provincial government sent as many as 70,000 words of telegrams every month. After an opposition to bureaucracy and rectification of writing style, it now only sends more than 20,000 words per month. Due to overlapping institutions and complicated procedures, important official documents and instructions for guiding work are not drafted personally by the leaders in charge, but are handed over to some new comrades who lack experience and are not very familiar with the work. The leaders are high above, busy reviewing, proofreading, and signing, with layers of procedures from department heads, section chiefs, division chiefs, section members, clerks, and staff members, creating "official document travel." The Civil Affairs Department is only a room away from the Chairman's office. If a document is to be delivered, it takes at least ten days from drafting to the Chairman's receipt. How can such serious bureaucracy not cause delays and harm people! Comrades, these facts should attract our attention. What should we do in the future? We must launch a campaign against corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and red tape. Red tape is one of the manifestations of bureaucracy, and bureaucracy is the foundation of corruption and waste. If we have bureaucracy, we give corrupt and wasteful people an opportunity to take advantage of, and they have a place to hide. These three are integrated and mutually reinforcing. To oppose and eliminate corruption and waste, we must also oppose bureaucracy and open fire on all three fronts. The second principle is to follow the mass line, mobilize the vast masses inside and outside the Party to take action together, and create a vigorous mass movement to ensure the victory and thorough completion of this movement. Third, we must fully promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Finally, there is the most important point, that leaders at all levels are responsible, take action personally, and lead and promote the victorious development of this movement. According to the current situation, there are still difficulties with the issue of leader responsibility. Some leaders may have some resistance. In fact, in the past two years, the more extravagant and wasteful were the leaders at all levels (of course, not every leader is wasteful). Now, it depends on whether the leaders at all levels are willing to stand on the position of the Party and the people to thoroughly correct their past mistakes and actively lead and launch this movement? Or do they want to continue to stand on their personal positions to cover up their mistakes and resist the movement? This is an identification and test for leaders at all levels. I hope that leaders at all levels can abandon the latter, respond to the Party's call, and actively lead the development of this movement. Some comrades think that this movement is a temporary measure and want to avoid the limelight. I tell you, comrades, this movement is lasting. Not only will we increase production and practice economy in the New Democratic stage; we will still increase production and practice economy when we enter socialist society. This is the fundamental policy for building a people's country. Comrades! For the sake of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and for the construction of the motherland, let us, the entire Party and the entire people, unite from top to bottom and seriously and thoroughly launch this great movement of increasing production and practicing economy!

    认真彻底地开展增产节约运动
    ——一九五一年十二月十日在中共湖北省直属机关委员会党员大会上的动员报告
    李先念同志们：
    自从毛主席号召我们“增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”以后，这个运动在北京、东北等地已轰轰烈烈展开了。可是，我们有少数同志还是充耳不闻，甚至有个别同志听的不耐烦了、不愿意再听了，这些同志还没有足够认识到这个运动的重大政治意义。增产节约运动对于抗美援朝战争，积累资金进行国防建设与经济建设，继续稳定物价，挽救一批走下坡路的干部、纯洁组织、密切党与群众的联系等等工作，都有重大关系。如果认真地彻底地展开这一运动，必将推动各方面的工作前进，大大提高工作效率。在座的同志们都是拥护毛主席的。毛主席号召我们，新的胜利期待着我们，我们应该由首长负责、全党动手，并团结全体人民一致动手，开展一个广泛的、持久的、群众性的增产节约运动。
    开展增产节约运动，同时必须坚决展开一个反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。我们机关干部里有没有贪污浪费呢？有的，目前铺张浪费的倾向是发展的，这种倾向对于个别单位或个别人来说还是严重的，问题是现在还未揭开。这需要我们党员同志来勇敢揭发。另外同志们中有这样一句话：“这次要整领导，与我们一般干部无关！”这个说法有一定的道理；但从另一方面说，我们全体同志有没有浪费的思想呢？有的，并且是相当普遍的，这些同志应该联系思想进行检查。不过，我们一些负责同志在这两年中间，铺张浪费的是多一点，从省委负责人起以至省级机关都有浪费现象。现在，省级机关的贪污数字还说不出来，浪费好多也说不出确数来。大家竞相比赛铺张浪费，以能够铺张浪费为“光荣”，像有些同志见某某机关不按照制度发了一些东西，这些同志不是站在党的立场上，来向他们进行规劝或批评，反而藉口跑到财政部门、或领导同志面前进行要挟说：“某某机关发了什么东西，我们为什么不发！”这是值得注意的，也是最危险的一种歪风。我们的一些长期过供给制生活的同志，有这样一种错误思想：“我的一切都交给党了，浪费一点还不应该吗！”还有一些老干部认为：“我过去有功，现在胜利了，还不应该多花几个钱吗！”这些同志“一切都交给党”是好的，“过去有功”，党和人民也没有忘记，要是拿这些作理由来要求个人的铺张浪费，那就是错误了。我们共产党员参加革命不是作买卖——拿自己当商品，向党讨价还价，我们应该“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”，在争取改善全体人民的生活基础上，来改善个人生活，这才称得起是“特殊材料制成的”。根据最近搜集到的材料来看：像黄陂县开支很大一笔钱修跳舞厅，县城里没有电灯，他们就在大白天跳个不休，这怎么能不脱离群众、遭到群众反对呢！应城膏矿公司，照账面来查应赚一百三十亿元，自以为赚的钱就可以任意花——什么盖房子呀，什么招待费呀等等，铺张浪费的结果实际上只剩下了三十亿元。省某公司不根据工作需要，任意扩大编制，一个公司竟拥有二十八个会计，人力的浪费不说，他们二十八个人，没事找事做，自己制定层层的繁复手续，二十八个人，一天的时间汇不出一亿款子，这种铺张浪费的风气，腐蚀了革命人员的思想，腐蚀了革命的组织。究竟这种歪风从那里来的呢？人们的思想支配行动，客观上我们在全国取得胜利，有了大城市，资本主义思想到处侵袭，反映到我们革命阵营来，思想不健康的一些同志便滋长着居功享受，甚至腐化堕落。省委过去对这一思想倾向没有足够地抓紧批判和纠正，光忙于剿匪反恶霸、减租减息、土地改革等中心工作，忘记或忽视了各种工作的开展必须首先端正干部的思想，这是我们省委领导上应该负责的。另一方面，由于思想领导不够，官僚主义就乘机侵袭了我们，我们接收了国民党的官僚机关，也无批判地多少不等地接收了一些官僚主义，表现在机关编制上虽然不是因人设事，但我们的机构的确是臃肿庞大。沙市某公司六个人可以作的事，却发展到二十六个人，有二十个人闲着玩。据说我们省级的编制超过规定三分之一，这还不够，省编制委员会在十月间征求各机关对缩减编制的意见时，大家却提出还要增加几千。这些同志只看见个个工作人员都忙的很，忙的不得开交，尤其打字员同志喊“整天就忙死了”，要检查一下大家究竟忙些什么呢！不能否认，忙了一些应该作的事情；也不能否认，的确是作了一些可有可无、或完全可以不作，作了还有害的事情，害的下面工作同志头昏眼花，光公文、指示等等就看不胜看。像省府在过去每月光发电报字数就有七万之多，经过一次反对官僚主义、整顿文风，现每月只发两万多字了。由于机构重叠，手续繁多，把运用指导工作的重要公文、指示，不是首长负责亲自起草，却交给一些缺乏经验的、对工作不很熟悉的新同志动手，领导者就高高在上，忙于审稿、核稿、签字，从厅长、处长、科长、股长、科员、办事员，层层手续，制造“公文旅行”。民政厅离主席办公室仅一房之隔，要是送达一件公文，从起稿直到主席收阅，起码得十几天的时间，这样严重的官僚主义，怎能不误事害人呢！同志们，这些事实是应该引起我们大家重视的时候了。今后怎么样办呢？我们必须开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义与文牍主义。文牍主义是官僚主义的表现形式之一种，官僚主义是贪污浪费的墙脚。我们有官僚主义，就给贪污浪费者以可乘之机，他们就有了藏身之所，这三者结为一体，是相因相成的。要反对和肃清贪污浪费现象，同时必须反对官僚主义，向三方面一齐开火。第二条原则是走群众路线，发动党内外广大群众一齐动手，造成一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，才能保证这一运动的胜利、彻底完成。第三、要充分地发扬批评与自我批评精神。最后，还有最重要的一条，各级首长负责，亲自动手，领导和推动这一运动胜利展开。根据现在的情况来看，首长负责这个问题还有困难，有些首长可能有若干抵抗情绪，事实上这两年来，铺张浪费多一些的是各级首长（当然不是每个首长都浪费）。现在，就要看各级首长是愿意站在党与人民的立场上来痛改前非，积极地领导和展开这一运动呢？还是想继续站在个人立场上来掩饰错误抵抗运动呢？这对各级首长是一个鉴定和考验。我希望各级首长能够放弃后者，响应党的号召，积极地领导开展这一运动。有些同志认为这个运动是个临时手段，想躲过风头。我告诉同志们，这个运动是持久的，不仅新民主主义阶段要增产节约；就是进入社会主义社会还是要增产节约，这是建设人民国家的根本方针。同志们！为了抗美援朝，为了祖国的建设，让我们全党、全体人民，上下一致认真地彻底地开展增产节约这一伟大运动吧！
