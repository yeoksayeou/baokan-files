Xinhua News Agency, Bern, December 9th: The Executive Committee meeting of the League of Red Cross Societies has opened in Geneva. Representatives from twenty-seven national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies are participating, including those from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, the United States, Great Britain, France, and other countries.

Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, when speaking about providing assistance to the Korean people, cited instances of atrocities committed by U.S. troops in Korea. She said: At the last meeting, we presented to the Executive Committee of the League of Red Cross Societies materials regarding the atrocities committed by U.S. forces in Korea: massacres of prisoners of war, killings of civilians, and the use of poison gas.

Li Dequan continued: In the past six months, U.S. forces have not only failed to stop their atrocities but have intensified them. The Americans are using the negotiations that have begun in Korea to serve their own purposes, intensifying the bombing of peaceful towns and villages in North Korea, causing a large number of civilian casualties. During this period, the U.S. military has used poison gas with particular frequency.

Li Dequan continued: Our association's mission is to provide assistance to people who are suffering. We cannot tolerate things like those mentioned in the report by the President of the North Korean Red Cross Society: U.S. troops are bombing Red Cross hospitals in North Korea, massacring our association's personnel. Li Dequan also said: U.S. aircraft bombed many cities in North Korea (including Pyongyang) targeting hospitals and other medical facilities, despite the fact that these facilities and hospitals had clearly visible Red Cross markings on their roofs.

The meeting chairman, Sandström (Sweden), repeatedly interrupted the Chinese representative's speech. When Li Dequan spoke about the atrocities committed by U.S. forces in North Korea, the chairman said her speech was political in nature and deprived her of her right to speak.

Li Dequan presented a proposal to the Executive Committee of the League of Red Cross Societies protesting the atrocities committed by U.S. forces in North Korea, protesting the bombing of North Korean civilians and prisoner-of-war camps by U.S. aircraft, and demanding a stop to these barbaric acts by U.S. forces. The proposal said: The League of Red Cross Societies calls on all national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies to expose the atrocities committed by U.S. forces in Korea through newspapers and radio stations. Li Dequan suggested that the proposal be submitted to the International Committee of the Red Cross and asked it to take appropriate measures to stop the atrocities committed by U.S. forces in Korea.

Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, also sent a letter to Sandström, protesting his unfair actions on behalf of the Chinese delegation.

In her second speech, Li Dequan suggested that the League of Red Cross Societies should express its support for banning atomic weapons and establishing international supervision to ensure that all countries comply with this ban.

Iranian representative Khalibou spoke at the meeting, exposing the predatory methods used by British imperialists to exploit the Iranian people. Khalibou said: British imperialists have plundered huge amounts of wealth from Iran for many years, causing our people to suffer. They have left the Iranian people in a state of hunger and poverty.

Soviet Red Cross representative Bashkov also spoke at the meeting. When he spoke about the issue of repatriating Soviet children, he said: This issue has been raised at association meetings more than once. The Soviet Red Cross delegation requests that this meeting of the Executive Committee pay attention to the extremely poor situation of the Soviet children who should be repatriated, and to the serious dangers threatening these Soviet children caused by the illegal actions of the occupying authorities in the Western occupation zones of Germany and Austria.

Bashkov said: You all know the fate of the Soviet children wandering in West Germany. They were forcibly transported there by the Hitlerite bandits. Hundreds and thousands of Soviet children were forced to leave their parents and were transported to West Germany to be slaves.

The Hitlerite bandits have collapsed for six years, but the fate of these Soviet children has still not changed. They are still being enslaved in the Western occupation zones of Germany and Austria, without the love of their mothers and the care of their fathers. They have a motherland—the Soviet Union—but some people are not allowing them to return to their motherland.

The occupying authorities in the western occupation zones of Germany and Austria have adopted cruel and persecutory methods against these defenseless Soviet children. They conduct illegal trials and, based on the results of the trials, decide to transport these Soviet children to various countries overseas.

The Soviet Union has repeatedly demanded that these Soviet children be repatriated, but despite this, these unprecedented illegal actions are still being carried out. As early as 1949, Meyer, the director of the Children's Search Department of the International Refugee Organization, said that the department had discovered the locations of 18,817 children who had been forcibly abducted by the Hitlerites, including 1,778 Soviet children. The League of Red Cross Societies has repeatedly passed resolutions to assist in the repatriation of Soviet children. Despite this, not a single child mentioned in Meyer's statement has been repatriated. The Soviet Red Cross submitted a list in October 1949, listing 205 children, none of whom have been repatriated.

We suggest that the Executive Committee pass the following resolution: The Secretariat of the League of Red Cross Societies, taking into account the previous resolutions on the repatriation of Soviet children from the western zones of Germany and Austria; and noting with regret that not a single child has been repatriated, which is a violation of humanitarian principles and causes parental suffering; in order to practically assist in the repatriation of all Soviet children, this association decides: (1) to request from the occupying authorities in the western zones of Germany and Austria a list of all children who have not yet been repatriated; (2) to appoint a special representative of this association, tasking him and the representative of the Soviet Red Cross to conduct direct negotiations with the relevant authorities to further the repatriation of Soviet children and to eliminate the obstacles arising in the process; (3) to request that the relevant authorities allow representatives of this association and the Soviet Red Cross to jointly visit the residences of Soviet children and meet with them.

Next, the Soviet representative spoke about the activities of the Red Cross. Bashkov said: The Soviet delegation believes that the League of Red Cross Societies must establish contact with the World Peace Council on the issue of all groups within its scope participating in the defense of peace. In order to implement the various resolutions previously passed, including the resolution of the 17th International Red Cross Conference on the defense of peace, the Soviet delegation suggests that the Executive Committee pass the following decision:

The Executive Committee of the League of Red Cross Societies, taking into account that the current arms expansion movement has caused economic chaos and impoverishment of the masses, and has increased the danger of wars that harm humanity; believes that the most important task in defending peace is to immediately and completely ban atomic weapons and other instruments of mass human slaughter, and to gradually and simultaneously reduce armaments; believes that actively working to defend peace is the most important task for the Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun, and other organizations today; the Executive Committee also notes that the League of Red Cross Societies has not yet taken effective measures to enable the national Red Cross societies to participate in the struggle to defend peace. Therefore, it calls on the national Red Cross societies and their members to do everything possible to oppose war preparations, advocate for gradual and simultaneous disarmament, and immediately and completely ban atomic weapons and other instruments of mass human slaughter; the Executive Committee instructs the association's secretariat to print brochures, posters, and magazines, and to use radio broadcasts and films to promote the ideas of international peace cooperation, gradual and simultaneous disarmament, and the immediate banning of atomic weapons and other instruments of mass human slaughter; the Executive Committee believes that, in order to "exchange experiences and discuss new forms and new methods of the Red Cross participating in the movement to defend peace, each meeting of the association must hear a special report from the Secretary-General and representatives of the national Red Cross societies on activities in this area.

　　红十字会协会执行委员会在日内瓦举行会议
    我国代表李德全呼吁制止侵朝美军暴行
    中、苏代表建议红十字会协会应赞成禁止原子武器和裁军
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伯尔尼九日电：红十字会协会执行委员会会议在日内瓦开幕。有二十七国红十字会和红新月会的代表参加，其中包括苏联，中华人民共和国，波兰，美国，英国，法国和其他国家的代表。
    中国红十字会会长李德全在讲到给予朝鲜人民以援助的问题时，引述了美国军队在朝鲜的暴行事例。她说：在上一次会议上，我们曾向红十字会协会执行委员会提出了美军在朝鲜暴行的材料：大批屠杀战俘，屠杀平民和使用毒气弹。
    李德全继续说道：在过去六个月中，美国军队不但没有停止他们的暴行，反而更加紧了他们的暴行。美国人利用在朝鲜开始的谈判来适应他们自己的目的，加紧轰炸北朝鲜的和平市镇和乡村，造成平民的大量死伤。在此期间美军使用毒气弹特别频繁。
    李德全继续说：我们协会的任务是给遭受苦难的人民以援助。我们不能容忍象北朝鲜红十字会会长报告中所举出的那种事情：美国军队正在轰炸朝鲜境内的红十字会医院，屠杀我们协会的工作人员。李德全又说：美国飞机轰炸北朝鲜许多城市（包括平壤在内）里的医院和其他医疗机构，尽管这些机构和医院的屋顶上绘有清晰可见的红十字标志。
    会议主席桑兹特朗（瑞典）一再阻挠中国代表的发言，当李德全谈到美军在北朝鲜的暴行时，主席说她的发言是政治性质的，剥夺了她的发言权。
    李德全向红十字会协会执行委员会提出一项提案，抗议美军在北朝鲜境内的暴行、抗议美国飞机轰炸北朝鲜平民和战俘营，并要求制止美军这些野蛮行为。提案说：红十字会协会号召所有各国红十字会和红新月会通过报纸和电台来揭发美军在朝鲜的暴行。李德全建议将提案提交红十字会国际委员会，并请其采取适当措施制止美国军队在朝鲜的暴行。
    中国红十字会会长李德全并致函桑兹特朗，以中国代表团的名义对他的不公平的举动提出抗议。
    李德全在第二次发言时建议：红十字会协会应表示赞成禁止原子武器和建立国际监督以保证各国遵守这项禁令。
    伊朗代表哈里布在会上发言时揭露了英帝国主义者用来剥削伊朗人民的强取豪夺的方法。哈里布说：英帝国主义者许多年来从伊朗抢去了巨额财富，使得我国人民受苦。他们已使伊朗人民处于饥饿和贫困的境地。
    苏联红十字会代表巴什科夫也曾在会上发言。他谈到关于遣送苏联儿童的问题时说：这个问题已经不止一次地提到协会会议上来了。苏联红十字会代表团要求执行委员会这次会议注意应予遣送的苏联儿童所处的极其恶劣的情况，注意德奥两国西方占领区占领当局的非法行动所造成的威胁着这些苏联儿童的重大危险。
    巴什科夫说：你们大家都知道流浪在西德的苏联儿童的遭遇。他们是被希特勒匪帮强制押运到那里去的。成百成千的苏联儿童被迫离开了父母，被押运到西德去当奴隶。
    希特勒匪帮崩溃已经六年了，可是这些苏联儿童的命运，仍然没有转变。他们仍然在德奥两国西方占领区受着奴役，得不到母亲的疼爱和父亲的抚育。他们有祖国——苏联，可是有人不许他们回到祖国去。
    德奥两国西部占领区的占领当局，对于赤手空拳的这些苏联儿童，采取了残酷迫害的办法。他们进行非法的审判，根据审判的结果决定把这些苏联儿童运到海外各个国家去。
    苏联曾不断地要求把这些苏联儿童遣送回国，尽管如此，这种没有前例的非法行动仍然在进行着。早在一九四九年的时候，国际难民组织的儿童寻找部部长梅耶就说，该部已经发现了被希特勒分子强行劫走的儿童一万八千八百一十七名的地点，这些儿童中间，有苏联儿童一千七百七十八名。红十字会协会屡次通过决定，决定协助遣送苏联儿童。尽管如此，梅耶声明中所提到的儿童，竟没有一个被遣送回国。苏联红十字会一九四九年十月提出了一个名单，那上面开列了二百零五名儿童，其中也没有一个被遣送回国。
    我们建议执行委员会通过下述决议：红十字会协会秘书处考虑到以前通过的从德国和奥地利西区遣送苏联儿童回国的决议；并遗憾地注意到还没有一个儿童被遣送回国，这种违反人道原则并造成父母痛苦的行为；为了实际协助遣送一切苏联儿童回国，本会决定：（一）向德国和奥地利西区占领当局索取全体尚未遣送回国的儿童的名单；（二）委派本协会特别代表一名，责成他和苏联红十字会的代表共同和有关当局进行直接谈判，以更遣送苏联儿童回国，并消除这其间所产生的障碍；（三）要求有关当局允许本协会和苏联红十字会代表共同访问苏联儿童居处，并会见他们。
    接着苏联代表谈到红十字会的活动。巴什科夫说：苏联代表团认为：红十字会协会必须在关于本身范围内的一切团体参加保卫和平的问题上和世界和平理事会建立联系。为了实行以前通过的种种决议，包括第十七届国际红十字会会议关于保卫和平的决议，苏联代表团建议执行委员会通过下述决定：
    红十字会协会执行委员会考虑到目前军备扩张运动已引起了经济混乱和人民群众的贫困，并且增加了祸害人类的战争的危险；认为保卫和平的最重要任务是立即彻底禁止原子武器和其他大规模屠杀人类的工具、逐步和同时地裁减军备；认为积极为保卫和平而努力是红十字会、红新月会、红狮会和太阳会等今天最重要的任务；执行委员会同时注意到红十字会协会还没有采取有效的措施使各国的红十字会参加保卫和平的斗争。所以号召各国红十字会及其会员竭尽全力反对战争准备、主张逐步地和同时地裁减军备、立即彻底禁止原子武器和其他大规模屠杀人类的工具；执行委员会责成协会秘书处印行小册子、招贴画、杂志，并利用无线电广播和电影以宣传关于国际和平合作、逐步地和同时地裁减军备以及立即禁止原子武器和其他大规模屠杀人类的工具的思想；执行委员会认为：为“交流经验和讨论红十字会参加保卫和平运动的新形式和新方法，协会的每一届会议必须听取秘书长和各国红十字会代表关于这方面活动的专题报告。
