    China Salt Industry Company Guangdong Province Company
    Twenty Transportation Accidents in Nine Months Resulting in the Loss of Over 600 Million Yuan in State Assets

    Editor: The Guangdong Provincial Company of the China Salt Industry Company has experienced twenty transportation accidents in the past nine months, resulting in a loss of over 660 million yuan in state assets. The company mainly relies on waterways to transport salt, so all the accidents that occurred were water transport accidents. Classified by type of accident, there were nine wind disasters, seven leaks, and four ship groundings. The Zhanjiang, Haikou, and Meixian branch companies had the most accidents, each with four incidents.

    The reasons for the accidents are: First, insufficient understanding of wind direction information and lack of preparation for wind protection; insufficient attention to seasonal climate and low vigilance against wind disasters. Second, failure to establish a sound ship inspection system. In the past, the salt company's ship inspections were very perfunctory, just looking at the surface and filling out forms, with a serious reliance on insurance companies. For example, when the provincial company entrusted the "Kaifa" ship to transport salt, the ash seams cracked after the salt was loaded onto the ship, damaging 124 bags of crude salt. The Meixian branch hired Chen Linxian's ship to transport salt, and it was only after the accident that they realized the ship's bottom was "too decayed." Third, failure to thoroughly understand the boatmen's situation beforehand. For example, Chen Linxian's ship was originally scheduled to run the Chao-Shan Sanhe line, but the Meixian branch hired him to transport salt from Shantou to Xingning without investigation, and he ran aground twice because he was unfamiliar with the route. Fourth, negligence on the part of transportation personnel. On May 26th of this year, the Zhanjiang branch hired the Qionganxing ship to transport salt, and 588 dan of edible salt were damaged due to the detachment of ash seams. On September 3rd, they hired this ship again to load cargo, and as a result, it sank in Sandun Port, resulting in a loss of approximately 4.8 million yuan. We believe that the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Salt Industry Company should pay close attention to this issue, learn from the above experiences and lessons, strengthen transportation management, and avoid similar accidents from happening again.

### 中国盐业公司广东省公司  九个月发生运输事故二十起损失国家资财六亿多

    中国盐业公司广东省公司
    九个月发生运输事故二十起损失国家资财六亿多
    编辑同志：中国盐业公司广东省公司，九个月来曾发生运输事故二十起，共损失国家资财六亿六千多万元。这个公司运输盐斤，主要是靠水路，因此所发生的事故都是水运事故。以事故种类来分，计风灾九件，渗漏七件，触礁四件。其中以湛江、海口、梅县等支公司最多，各发生四件。
    造成事故的原因是：一、对风向的消息掌握不够，没有防风的准备；不注意季节气候，对风灾的警惕性不高。二、没有建立健全的验船制度。过去盐业公司验船时很不认真，只是看看表面，填表了事，有严重地依赖保险公司的思想。如省公司交“开发”船载运盐斤，盐斤落船后，灰缝破裂，淹损芦盐一百二十四包；梅县支公司雇陈林先的船运盐，事故发生后，才知道船底“过于腐朽”。三、没有事先深入了解船户情况。如陈林先的船原定走潮汕三河线，梅县支公司没有经过了解，便雇用他从汕头运盐到兴宁，因航线不熟，曾两度触礁。四、运输工作人员麻痹大意。今年五月二十六日，湛江支公司雇琼安兴船运盐，因灰缝脱落，淹损食盐五百八十八担；九月三日又雇这条船装运，结果又在三墩港沉没，损失约值四百八十万元。我们认为广东省盐业公司领导方面对这一问题亟应引起注意，接受上述经验教训，加强运输管理工作，避免再发生类似事故。        广东省商业厅通讯组
