    The French Invaders' Despicable Plot to Invade Vietnam Is Doomed to Fail

    The French invading forces in Vietnam are struggling desperately, hoping to maintain their occupied areas under the increasing pressure from the Vietnamese people, continue to cruelly exploit the Vietnamese people, and reserve a military base for American imperialism to invade Asia. They are increasingly fearful of the power of the Vietnamese people, so they are trying their best to build a series of defensive fortifications in northern Vietnam. French Minister of Relations with the Associated States of Indochina, Letourneau, said not long ago that the first fortification system they built would "protect" the port and military base of Haiphong; the second fortification system would "protect" Hanoi, and the third would "protect" the far north of Vietnam (see United Press International, Paris, November 22). The French invaders delusionally attempt to rely on some "fortification systems" to "protect" their currently barely maintained occupied areas. However, these "fortifications" cannot "protect" them. Past facts have already proven this point. For example, the so-called "heavily fortified" Ninh Binh City was captured by the Vietnamese People's Army in one fell swoop in June this year.

    In addition to building defensive fortifications in a big way, the French invaders are also forcibly conscripting Vietnamese youths in their occupied areas to serve as cannon fodder for them, in order to achieve the despicable goal of "using Vietnamese to kill Vietnamese." According to the Vietnamese Labor Party's organ publication "People" Weekly on October 25, the French invaders are frantically expanding their armaments and preparing for war domestically in pursuit of the United States, and it is difficult for them to obtain the troops from home and North Africa needed to replenish the huge losses of the invasion of Vietnam. The number of officers trained in France each year is not even enough to fill the vacancies of officer losses in the invasion of Vietnam. Therefore, the French invaders use the most barbaric and cruel methods to force Vietnamese youths to join the army. At present, the percentage of puppet troops in the French invading army in Vietnam has reached as high as 65 percent, and even its "Foreign Legion" and "Parachute Troops" have to be mixed with a large number of puppet troops. However, the patriotic Vietnamese people will never allow themselves to be driven by the invaders to shoot their compatriots; this change in the composition of the French invading army is precisely a factor that will inevitably lead it to greater failure.

    In several battles in Ha Dong Province, Ha Nam Province, and other provinces in North Vietnam in October and the first half of November, the French invading army was captured in units of two companies or more at a time, which shows that the Vietnamese People's Army's policy of lenient treatment of prisoners of war, which has been implemented for several years, has had a wide impact within the invading army. The Vietnamese People's Army and local people's armed forces will continue to carry out victorious battles, and resolutely consolidate and develop the people's base areas and strengthen guerrilla warfare in the French-occupied areas; the French invaders' despicable plot to "use Vietnamese to kill Vietnamese" can be completely defeated.

    侵越法军的可耻阴谋一定失败
    在越南的法国侵略军，正在竭力挣扎，希图在越南人民日渐增大的压力下保持它的侵占地区，继续残酷地压榨越南人民并为美帝国主义侵略亚洲保留军事基地。他们对越南人民的威力越来越感到恐惧，所以竭力在越南北部修建一系列的防御工事。法国的印度支那联邦成员国关系部部长勒都尔诺不久前曾说，他们修筑的第一个工事体系将“保护”海防港口和军事基地；第二个工事体系将“保护”河内，第三个将“保护”越南的极北部（见合众社巴黎十一月二十二日电）。法国侵略者妄想依恃一些“工事体系”来“保护”它们目前勉强保持着的侵占区。可是，这些“工事”是“保护”不了它们的。过去的事实早已证明了这一点。例如今年六月间他们所谓“设防坚固”的宁平城，就曾被越南人民军一举攻克。
    法国侵略者除大事修建防御工事外，还在它的侵占区内强征越南青年给它当炮灰，以达到“利用越南人杀越南人”的可耻目的。据十月二十五日越南劳动党机关刊物“人民”周刊刊载，法国侵略者因追随美国在本国内疯狂扩军备战，它从国内和北非已很难获得补充侵越战争的浩大损失所需的兵力。法国国内每年训练的军官人数，尚不足填补在侵越战争中军官损失的缺额。因此，法国侵略者就用最野蛮最残酷的方法，强迫越南青年入伍。目前，在越南的法国侵略军内伪军的百分比已高达百分之六十五，甚至它的“外国兵团”和“伞兵部队”中也不得不夹杂大批的伪军。然而，爱国的越南人民决不会听任侵略者的驱使而枪杀自己的同胞的；法国侵略军内部组成的这个变化，正是它必然走向更大失败的因素。
    十月间和十一月上半月在北越河东省、河南省等省内的几次战役中，法国侵略军一次被俘即在两个连以上，这说明越南人民军几年来执行的宽待俘虏政策已经在侵略军内部有了广泛的影响。越南人民军和地方人民武装必将继续进行胜利的战斗，并坚决在法国侵占区巩固和发展人民根据地和加强游击战争；法国侵略者这种“利用越南人杀越南人”的可耻阴谋是完全可以被击败的。
