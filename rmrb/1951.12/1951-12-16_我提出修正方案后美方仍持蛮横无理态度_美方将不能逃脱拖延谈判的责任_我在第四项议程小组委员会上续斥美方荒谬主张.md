Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 15th: On the 14th, in order to break the deadlock in the negotiations on the third agenda item and seek rapid progress in the armistice negotiations, our delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations proposed amendments, agreeing within reasonable limits to the other side's request to rotate its armed forces and personnel during the armistice period, and adopted all the reasonable suggestions of the other side. However, at the subcommittee meeting on the third agenda item on the 15th, the other side's representatives claimed that our side had not made sufficient concessions, insisted on interfering in internal affairs, prohibiting the construction of facilities within Korea, demanding inspections throughout Korea, and advocating unlimited import of military forces and ammunition from outside Korea for rotation and replenishment. The other side twice unreasonably stated that they would "disregard" our objections, and even arrogantly claimed that the other side currently has sufficient military capability to threaten our rear, prevent the construction of facilities in our rear, conduct aerial inspections in the rear, and interfere in our internal affairs, and that this status quo should be fully maintained during the armistice period. Our representative severely condemned the other side's overestimation of its own strength, its attempt to threaten our side and its attitude of refusing to negotiate, pointing out that the other side's persistence in this obstinate and unreasonable attitude for the past four days, especially after our side proposed amendments on the 14th, will not escape responsibility for delaying the negotiations.

At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative continued to refute the other side's refusal to discuss the reasonable principle of a prompt release and repatriation of all prisoners of war proposed by our side, and their insistence that their so-called preconditions must first be met before entering the discussion of the fourth agenda item. Our representative once again demanded that the other side express a simple and clear attitude towards the principles proposed by our side, so as to quickly enter the discussion of specific arrangements for prisoners of war and immediately exchange information on prisoners of war on both sides. However, the other side still refused to express its attitude, so the meeting failed to make any progress.

    我提出修正方案后美方仍持蛮横无理态度
    美方将不能逃脱拖延谈判的责任
    我在第四项议程小组委员会上续斥美方荒谬主张
    【新华社开城十五日电】十四日朝鲜停战谈判的我方代表团为打开第三项议程谈判中的僵局，求得停战谈判的迅速进展，提出修正方案，在合理的限度内同意了对方在停战期间轮换其武装部队与人员的要求，并采纳了对方所有合理的建议。但对方代表在十五日第三项议程的小组委员会上却声称，我方没有作足够的让步，坚持其干涉内政，禁止朝鲜境内设备的修建，并在朝鲜全境进行视察的要求，以及自朝鲜境外无限制地输入军事力量与武器弹药的轮换与补充的主张。对方并两次无理声称将“不理睬”我方的反对的意见，甚至狂妄地声称对方目前有充分的军事能力威胁我后方，阻止我后方设备的修建，在后方进行空中视察，并干涉我内政，而这种现状本应在停战期间全部保持。我方代表痛斥对方这种不自量力、妄图威胁我方并拒绝协商的态度，指出对方在四天以来特别在我方十四日提出修正方案以后，坚持这种蛮横无理的态度，将不能逃脱拖延谈判的责任。
    在第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方拒绝讨论我方所提出的迅速释放与遣送全部战俘的合理原则，而坚持必须首先满足其所谓先决条件，始能进入第四项议程的讨论的荒谬主张。我方代表再度要求对方对我方所提出的原则简单而明确地表示态度，以便迅速进入有关战俘的具体安排的讨论，并立即交换双方战俘的资料。但对方仍然拒绝表示态度，以致会议未能获得任何进展。
