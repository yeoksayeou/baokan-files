    Journals Should Abolish Volume Numbers and Use Year and Month to Calculate Issue Numbers
    To the Editor: China's publishing industry has seen great development in the past two years. In order to improve our publishing work, I suggest that starting from New Year's Day 1952, all magazines and journals nationwide abolish volume numbers and switch to using year and month to calculate issue numbers. For example, for a monthly magazine: the issue published in January 1952 would be the first issue of 1952, the issue published in February would be the second issue of 1952… and the issue published in December would be the twelfth issue of 1952. "People's Weekly" has used this method since its inaugural issue, and "Xinhua Monthly" has also switched to this method starting from November of this year.
    Abolishing volume numbers and switching to using year and month to calculate issue numbers has several benefits: First, it is convenient for readers to remember, and errors can be avoided when purchasing single copies, subscribing, and renewing subscriptions; second, it will provide considerable convenience in terms of citing journal issues in reference materials, mutual republication, library management, registration, indexing, and bookstore and post office distribution, eliminating errors caused by complex volume and issue numbers.
    Using year and month to calculate issue numbers can make the number of issues clearer to readers. For example, a quarterly magazine has four issues per year; a bimonthly magazine has six issues per year; a monthly magazine has twelve issues per year; and a weekly magazine has fifty-two issues per year. As for binding journals, it can be decided whether to bind them annually, semi-annually, or every three months or every month, depending on the thickness of each issue of the magazine. This is very convenient for collection and reference.	Hong Mu

    期刊应废除卷次改用年月计期数
    编辑同志：两年来中国人民出版事业已有了很大的发展。为了改进我们的出版工作，我建议自一九五二年元旦开始全国各种杂志期刊废除卷次，改用年月计期数。如以月刊为例：一九五二年一月出版的为一九五二年第一期，二月出的为一九五二年第二期………以十二月出版的为一九五二年第十二期。“人民周报”从创刊号起就用了这种办法，“新华月报”从今年十一月份起也改用了这种办法。
    废除卷次，改用年月计期数是有好处的：一、便于读者记忆，在零购、订阅、续订时可以避免发生错误；二、在资料引用、相互转载的志期上，图书管理、登记及索引的志期上，书店、邮局发行工作的志期上都将得到不少方便，可免去因卷期复杂所引起的错误。
    改用年月计期数，可使读者对期刊的期数更为明确，如季刊是每年四期；双月刊是每年六期；月刊是每年十二期，周刊是每年五十二期。至于在期刊的合订方面，可视杂志每期的厚薄决定一年合订，半年合订，或三个月，一个月合订。这对收藏和查阅都是很方便的。	红木
