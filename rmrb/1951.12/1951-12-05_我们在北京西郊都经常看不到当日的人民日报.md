    To the Editors: We are readers of the People's Daily from the Huabei Cadre Sanatorium in the hot springs area of the western suburbs of Beijing. Although we live in Beijing, we cannot see the People's Daily on the day of publication every day. Five or six times each month, we have to read newspapers that are one or two days old. As we write this letter, we have not seen a newspaper for three days, which is a very bad situation. We suggest that the relevant departments pay attention to this issue and correct the error. Readers from the Huabei Cadre Sanatorium, hot springs area, western suburbs of Beijing.

    我们在北京西郊都经常看不到当日的人民日报
    编辑同志：我们是北京市西郊温泉的人民日报读者。我们虽然住在北京市，但是却不能每天都看到当日的人民日报。我们每个月总有五六次要看隔天的、或隔两天的报纸，当我们在写这封信的时候，我们已经三天没有看报了，这是很不好的现象。我们建议有关方面注意这问题，并纠正错误。西郊温泉华北干部疗养院的读者们
