Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 10th. The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 9th, denouncing the U.S.'s conspiracy to continue delaying the Korean armistice negotiations. The commentary stated: The discussions on the third agenda item in the past ten days or so have clearly demonstrated that while our side has been striving for the early success of the armistice negotiations, the other side continues to adhere to its shameless and unreasonable demands, and adopts a policy of delaying the negotiations.

The commentary said: Under the pretext of rotating armed personnel and replenishing weapons and ammunition, the U.S. insists on the absurd proposition that military forces and weapons and ammunition can be imported from outside Korea during the armistice period, and opposes our proposal that neither side should import any military forces and weapons and ammunition from outside Korea under any pretext. The commentary said: Since fighting is to be stopped, why is it necessary to replenish weapons and ammunition, and why is it necessary to rotate new troops? Is it that the Americans need to replenish weapons and ammunition in order to "hunt" in Korea after the armistice? Is it that the Americans want to rotate troops in order to allow their descendants to visit the Korean territory ravaged by their beastly atrocities?

The commentary further said: The U.S. still avoids giving a positive response to our proposal that both sides jointly invite neutral countries to form a supervisory body to inspect the rear ports agreed upon by both sides, and continues to advocate that inspection agencies and inspection teams be organized by personnel designated by the belligerent parties to freely enter and exit the entire territory of Korea for so-called "free inspection." These facts eloquently prove that the other side does not want genuine peace, but wants to use the armistice period to spy on the secrets of our republic, interfere in the internal affairs of the republic, and restrict our right to strengthen defense and economic construction; at the same time, it also exposes the other side's conspiracy to strengthen its aggressive forces and expand the Korean War.

The commentary said: The Korean people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely oppose the shameless demands of the American aggressors, and solemnly warn the U.S. that it must accept the fair and reasonable proposals put forward by our side so that the third agenda item can be agreed upon as soon as possible, so as to quickly enter the discussion of the fourth and fifth agenda items, and quickly realize the armistice. If the other side continues to adhere to its unreasonable demands, then the responsibility for delaying the negotiations should be borne entirely by the other side.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 10th. "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an article on the 8th, severely criticizing the absurd demands insisted upon by the U.S. on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations.

The "Democratic Korea" article pointed out: The U.S. demand that the armistice commission can freely enter and exit the entire territory of Korea is clearly aimed at spying on the state secrets of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and interfering in the internal affairs of the republic. The enemy sends spies almost every day in order to spy on the secrets of our republic and carry out sabotage activities; however, the Korean people have foiled the enemy's attempts with high vigilance. Therefore, the enemy shamelessly wants to take this opportunity to spy on secrets and prepare for a new war of aggression. The Korean people will never tolerate such a provocative proposal from the enemy.

The article also said that while the U.S. claims that neither side should increase troops and military equipment from outside Korea during the armistice period, on the other hand, it demands that "rotation" and "replenishment" of American troops and equipment be allowed. This self-contradictory proposition is an attempt to put our republic in a defenseless position and continue to strengthen their forces and equipment in Korea to re-ignite the war. The article emphasized: The Korean people have the right to restore and strengthen their defense facilities during the military armistice period. This sacred and inviolable right cannot be interfered with by anyone. At the same time, the Korean people absolutely cannot tolerate the enemy's sinister conspiracy to re-ignite the war of aggression from succeeding.

The article said: The U.S. demand to occupy our rear islands not only violates the agreement on the second agenda item, but also attempts to place our territorial waters within their artillery blockade circle, directly threatening our rear. This absurd proposal is also absolutely unacceptable to the Korean people.

The article concluded: Today, when the second agenda item has already been agreed upon, the U.S. is still insisting on its absurd propositions, which proves that the U.S. has not abandoned its ambition to carry out a war of aggression. We, the Korean people, resolutely condemn it. If the U.S. continues to adhere to its absurd and unreasonable propositions, then there will be no progress in the meeting in the future, and this responsibility should be borne entirely by the U.S.

    朝鲜中央通讯社和“民主朝鲜”报著文
    痛斥美方关于第三项议程的荒谬要求
    朝鲜人民决不准美方利用所谓“自由视察”干涉内政
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜中央通讯社在九日发表评论，斥责美方继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋。评论写道：最近十多天来关于第三项议程的讨论，清楚地说明了我方一直努力争取停战谈判的早日成功，对方却继续坚持它的厚颜无耻的无理主张，采取拖延谈判的政策。
    评论说：美方以轮换武装人员和补充武器弹药为藉口，坚持停战期间可由朝鲜境外输入军事力量和武器弹药的荒谬主张，反对我方提出的双方不得在任何藉口下从朝鲜境外输入任何军事力量和武器弹药的主张。评论说：既然要停止战斗，何须武器弹药的补充，何须新的军队的轮换呢？难道停战后美国人是为了要在朝鲜“打猎”而需要补充武器弹药吗？难道美国人是为了让他们的后辈参观被他们野兽般的暴行所蹂躏的朝鲜疆土而要轮换军队吗？
    评论又说：美方对于我方所提出的双方共同邀请中立国组成监察机构到双方同意的后方口岸进行视察的建议，仍然避免作正面的答复，继续主张以交战双方所指定的人员组织监察机构和视察小组，自由出入朝鲜全境，进行所谓“自由视察”。这些事实，雄辩地证明了对方不愿意真正的和平，而是要利用停战期间来刺探我们共和国的机密，干涉共和国的内政，限制我们加强防御和经济建设的权利；同时，也暴露了对方企图加强侵略势力、扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。
    评论说：朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，坚决反对美国侵略者这种无耻的要求，并严正警告美方，必须接受我方提出的公平合理的建议，使第三项议程早日达成协议，以迅速进入第四、第五项议程的讨论，并迅速实现停战。如果对方继续坚持它的无理主张，那么拖延谈判的责任完全应由对方担负。
    【新华社平壤十日电】“民主朝鲜”报在八日发表论文，严斥美方在朝鲜停战谈判会议第三项议程上所坚持的荒谬要求。
    “民主朝鲜”的论文指出：美方要求停战委员会可以自由出入全朝鲜，目的显然在于刺探朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国家机密，干涉共和国的内政。敌人为了刺探我们共和国的机密，进行破坏活动，几乎每天都派间谍分子来；但是，朝鲜人民以高度的警惕性，粉碎了敌人的企图。因此，敌人又无耻地想利用这个机会来刺探机密，准备进行新的侵略战争。朝鲜人民绝不能容忍敌方这种挑衅性的建议。
    论文又说，美方一面主张停战期间双方不得自朝鲜境外增加军队和军事装备，但另一方面却又要求允许美国军队和装备的“轮换”和“补充”，这种自相矛盾的主张是企图使我们共和国处于无防御的地位，并继续在朝鲜加强他们的兵力和装备，重新挑起战争。论文强调指出：朝鲜人民有权在军事停战期间恢复和加强自己的防御设备。这种神圣不可侵犯的权利，不容许任何人加以干涉。同时，朝鲜人民也绝对不能容忍敌方企图重新挑起侵略战争的险恶阴谋得逞。
    论文说：美方关于占领我方后方岛屿的要求，不但违反了第二项议程的协议，而且想把我们的领海置于他们的炮火封锁圈内，直接威胁我们的后方。这个荒谬提案也是朝鲜人民绝对不能接受的。
    论文最后说：在第二项议程已经达成协议的今天，美方仍在坚持它的荒谬主张，这就证明美方没有放弃进行侵略战争的野心，我们朝鲜人民坚决予以痛斥。如果美方继续坚持他的荒谬无理的主张，那么会议今后就不会有任何进展，这一责任应完全由美方担负。
