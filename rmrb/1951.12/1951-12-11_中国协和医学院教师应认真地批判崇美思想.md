    Teachers of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Should Seriously Criticize Pro-American Ideologies
    To the Editor: After reading Dr. Deng Jiadong's article "We Must Criticize Everything About the Past 'Peking Union Medical College'," we felt very excited. In order to allow "Peking Union Medical College" to rapidly change its American-style academic system and hospital system, which are not suited to China's needs, we believe that exposing all the shortcomings of "Peking Union Medical College" and seriously criticizing them is very necessary.
    Currently, some personnel at "Peking Union Medical College" still harbor serious pro-American ideologies. We will never allow pro-American ideologies to continue to exist in the newly reborn "Peking Union Medical College," and we cannot be satisfied with the snail-like progress of "Peking Union Medical College." We demand a thorough reform of "Peking Union Medical College." Dr. Deng Jiadong's "criticism" of Peking Union Medical College is a good start, and all "Peking Union Medical College" teachers should connect it with their own thoughts and criticize everything about "Peking Union Medical College."

    中国协和医学院教师应认真地批判崇美思想
    编辑同志：看到了邓家栋医师“我们要批判过去
  ‘协和’的一切”的文章以后，我们感到非常兴奋。为了使“协和”迅速地改变美国式的不切合中国需要的那一套学制和医院制度，我们认为揭露“协和”的一切缺点，并认真地加以批判是很必要的。
    现在“协和”的部分人员中，还有着严重的崇美思想。我们决不容许崇美思想继续在新生的“协和”存在，我们也不能满足于“协和”那种蜗牛式的进步，我们要求“协和”来一个彻底的改革。邓家栋医师对协和的“批判”是一个良好的开端，所有“协和”的教师都应该联系自己的思想，对“协和”的一切加以批判。
