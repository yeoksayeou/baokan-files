To the Editor:
    The Benxi No. 2 Power Plant boiler workshop in Northeast China successfully used No. 2 coal (local inferior coal) to burn boilers this spring, creating the lowest coal consumption record in the Northeast. Since the launch of the production and frugality campaign, the quality of coal produced by various coal mines has greatly improved, and No. 2 coal is no longer produced, thus affecting the fuel supply of the No. 2 Power Plant. The power plant workers continued their research and created a new experience of burning boilers with slag (slag is the remaining debris after coal washing, with high ash content and many stones). The leading cadres of the plant repeatedly studied this experience and finally decided to use slag to burn boilers. The workers in the boiler workshop further solved the method of preventing flameout, and finally proved that it is entirely possible to burn boilers with slag. Various workshop groups continued to put forward several rationalization proposals for improving boiler equipment and operating technology, reducing the fuel cost from 87 yuan per kilowatt-hour in the past to 36 yuan. In October, using slag to burn boilers saved more than 380 million yuan. It is estimated that the plant can save 4.6 billion yuan annually. This method is a huge advancement in fuel-fired power generation. If it can be promoted nationwide, the industrial coal consumption can be greatly reduced.

    本溪第二发电厂锅炉车间
    创造利用水渣烧锅炉的方法  全厂每年可节省四十六亿元
    编辑同志：东北本溪第二发电厂锅炉车间，在今年春季试用二号煤（本地劣等煤）烧锅炉成功，创造了全东北最低煤耗纪录。自从生产节约运动展开以来，各煤矿生产的煤的质量大大提高，不再出产二号煤，因此，影响了第二发电厂的燃料供应。发电厂职工继续研究，又创造了用水渣烧锅炉的新经验。这个厂的领导干部反复研究了这个经验，最后决定用水渣来烧锅炉（水渣是洗煤后剩余的碎渣子，灰分大，石头多）。锅炉车间工人进一步解决了防止熄火的方法，最后证明，用水渣烧锅炉是完全可以的。各车间小组又继续提出了几种关于改善锅炉设备和操作技术的合理化建议，使燃煤成本从过去每度电八十七元，降低到三十六元。十月份利用水渣烧锅炉，节省了三亿八千多万元。预计厂里每年可节省四十六亿元。这种方法，在用燃料发电方面，是一个巨大的进步。如能推广到全国，工业用煤消耗量就可大量减少。谢丹萍
