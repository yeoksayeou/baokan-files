    Propagandist Liu Jikuai Turns "Quarrel Corner" into Reading Group
    In the past, villagers gathered only to "argue," not to discuss state affairs.
    At the T-junction in the south of Zhaolingpu Village, a suburb of Shijiazhuang City, there is a dilapidated small temple. Xing's stall is located here, with Li's grocery store to the east. All year round, whether at noon or in the evening, many villagers gather here to chat idly. They talk about "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Journey to the West," and "Investiture of the Gods," a confused jumble of things, pulling east and dragging west. "Arguing" is a common occurrence, and everyone often argues endlessly over some inexplicable matter. Therefore, everyone calls this place "Quarrel Corner." Although arguing is not good, there are indeed twenty or thirty people who often gather at "Quarrel Corner" to rest and chat. Before liberation, they kept silent about national affairs because experience had taught them: "Don't talk about state affairs, to avoid trouble." After liberation, although these people did not completely "not talk about state affairs," they still did not care about them. During the "May Day" Labor Day this year, Shijiazhuang City carried out widespread and in-depth anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda. At "Quarrel Corner," some people said: "What does America fighting in Korea have to do with China? Why bother getting involved?" When the government called on farmers to grow more cotton, some said: "If there is too much cotton, there won't be enough rice to eat, and the livestock won't have enough grass to eat; if the government doesn't buy it, and the price drops, it will be terrible." Such words were spread intentionally or unintentionally, often causing some negative effects.

    Propagandist Liu Jikuai Read the Newspaper to Everyone, Changing the Atmosphere of "Quarreling"
    In June of this year, a propaganda network was established in the village. Party propagandist Liu Jikuai had long wanted to change this atmosphere of "quarreling," so he suggested to the Party branch that they mobilize everyone to read the newspaper. On October 5th, the branch held a general meeting and resolved to establish a newspaper reading group at this T-junction, with Liu Jikuai serving as the newspaper reader. He was to gradually raise the political awareness of the masses through reading the newspaper. Liu Jikuai knew: "It's not that the masses are unwilling to listen to national affairs, but that our propagandists have not done enough publicity." Therefore, he had great enthusiasm for this work.

    In the evening, Liu Jikuai squatted with others at "Quarrel Corner," listening to everyone talk about "ancient stories." He thought, "Start with ancient stories first, and lead everyone to the current national affairs." At this time, the Shijiazhuang Daily began to publish the comic strip "Song Jingshi and Wu Xun." Liu Jikuai prepared the materials and waited for an opportunity to say to everyone: "The newspaper is publishing the comic strip 'Song Jingshi and Wu Xun,' which is all about ancient stories, very good! Would you all like to listen?" Some of the older people had heard of Wu Xun in the past, but did not know what Song Jingshi did, and wanted Liu Jikuai to read it to them. Liu Jikuai saw that everyone agreed, so he read the explanatory text of the comic strip to everyone. People immediately started discussing it. Those older people who had heard of Wu Xun said: "What the newspaper wrote is wrong, Wu Xun is a good person, he begged for food to run a school for poor children to attend." Young peasants disagreed, saying: "Where is the newspaper wrong? The current newspaper has never told lies." Liu Jikuai said: "The school run by Wu Xun was a private school, and those who studied were all children of landlords, and the books they read were all about ruling the poor." He told everyone that they would understand after reading the newspaper for a few more days. Several evenings passed, and the villagers listened with great interest. Before dark, many people came early. After each reading, everyone always discussed it for a while, and most people understood what kind of person Wu Xun was. Farmer He Qun said: "In the past, I heard people say that Wu Xun ran a school for the poor. After listening to the newspaper for a few days, I realized that Wu Xun, also known as Wu Doumo, was a lackey of the landlord. He bullied people, lent money, and rented land, and was not on the same path as us peasants." Many people also felt that listening to the newspaper every night could increase their knowledge, which was much better than sitting idle and arguing senselessly. On October 13th, the newspaper did not publish a comic strip, and the villagers were very anxious, asking: "What happened next time?" Liu Luzi said: "Even if there is no comic strip, don't be idle. Liu Jikuai is a propagandist, read something else for us! There are many important events published in the newspaper!" Liu Jikuai obtained everyone's consent and read to them the news about the Korean armistice negotiations published in the newspaper, and explained the reason why the people of the whole country were rising up to resist America and aid Korea. After reading, everyone discussed it for a while as usual.

    The Villagers Understood National Affairs and Completed Donations and Payments Ahead of Schedule
    As everyone became interested in listening to the newspaper, the number of people who came to listen every night gradually increased. Du Laorong, who was over sixty years old, also came every day. Seeing that everyone's enthusiasm for listening to the newspaper was getting higher and higher, Liu Jikuai added political and current affairs news and news about donations in the city in a planned way, according to everyone's requirements. One evening, he read to everyone the news that "American imperialists admit that their casualties in Korea are heavy and that the Korean War is a bottomless pit." Zhang Shanbao said: "Let's strive to complete the donation plan we set as soon as possible! Send the planes and cannons to the front line quickly, defeat American imperialism as soon as possible, and let us focus on production with peace of mind." On the spot, more than thirty villagers expressed their willingness to complete the donation plan ahead of schedule, and guaranteed to pay it all off by the end of October. Later, when they heard news in the newspaper about other villages completing their donations ahead of schedule, they all became anxious and paid off all the donations ahead of schedule in mid-October. Farmer Shi Shunlai participated in listening to the newspaper and resolved the ideological concerns of himself and his family: his nephew was a counter-revolutionary and had been arrested by the government. Shi Shunlai and his family were afraid of being implicated, and production was very uneasy. On the evening of October 31st, he listened to the news of "Fan Village's Ding Gengshen Accusing His Traitor Father of His Crimes" and felt relieved. He said to everyone: "After listening to Ding Gengshen's accusation, I felt relieved and realized that the people's government's policy is to suppress whoever commits a crime." Other farmers who participated in listening to the newspaper also felt great interest in listening to the newspaper. In particular, the things about Soviet collective farm peasants using machines to plant and harvest made everyone envious and caused endless discussions.

    The Villagers Officially Established a Newspaper Reading Group
    The villagers in this area recently formally established a newspaper reading group. Liu Jikuai was elected as the group leader, and Liu Mo and Liu Jirong were elected as newspaper readers, reading the newspaper in two shifts at noon and in the evening. The newspaper reading group has a high reputation among the masses in Zhaolingpu Village. Now, forty to fifty people participate in newspaper reading every night, sometimes up to seventy or eighty.

    Editor's Opinion: Party propagandist Liu Jikuai improved the awareness of the masses through reading the newspaper, turning them from not caring about national affairs to loving the motherland. This fact vividly illustrates that the newspaper reading group is one of the propaganda forms suitable for the needs of the broad masses. Therefore, Party propagandists should firmly grasp this weapon.

    In the vast rural areas and small and medium-sized cities, there are many places where the masses gather, such as "Quarrel Corner." Local Party propagandists should, like Liu Jikuai, guide the masses to care about current affairs and politics in a way that meets the needs of the masses, and organize them to conduct regular newspaper reading and learning on the basis of improving the awareness of the masses. Doing so can not only ensure the smooth completion of various tasks, but also further strengthen the relationship between the Party, the government, and the masses.

### 宣传员刘际魁把“抬杠铺”变成读报组

    宣传员刘际魁把“抬杠铺”变成读报组
    过去老乡们聚在一起只“抬杠”，不谈国事
    石家庄市郊区赵陵铺村南头的十字路口上，有一座破旧的小庙。这里摆着邢家小摊，小摊东边是李家杂货铺。一年四季，无论中午和晚上，许多老乡都聚在这里拉闲话。什么“三国演义”、“西游记”、“封神榜”，云里雾里，东拉西扯。“抬杠”是常事，大家常为一件莫名其妙的事争论不休。因此，大家都叫这里是“抬杠铺”。抬杠虽然不好，可是偏偏有那么二、三十个人，经常聚到“抬杠铺”，歇息，闲扯。解放以前，他们闭口不谈国家大事，因为事实教训了他们：“莫谈国事，免生是非。”解放后，这些人虽然不完全是“莫谈国事”，但对国事还是不关心的。今年“五一”劳动节，石家庄市进行了普及深入的抗美援朝宣传。在“抬杠铺”就有人说：“美国打朝鲜和中国有啥相干，何必多管闲事。”政府号召农民多种棉花，有人说：“棉花多了没米吃，牲口没草吃；要是政府一不收，价钱一落，就糟糕了。”这样的话有意无意地传播着，常常造成一些不好的影响。
    宣传员刘际魁向大家读报，改变了“抬杠”的风气
    今年六月，村里建立了宣传网。党的宣传员刘际魁早就想改变这种“抬杠”的风气，就向党的支部建议，发动大家读报。支部在十月五日开了支部大会，决议在这个十字路口，成立一个读报组，由刘际魁担任读报员。要他通过读报，逐步地提高群众的政治觉悟。刘际魁知道：“群众不是不愿听国家大事，而是我们宣传员宣传的不够。”所以他对这项工作，抱有很大的热情。
    晚上，刘际魁和别人一起蹲在“抬杠铺”，听大家谈“古事”。他想：“先拿古事起头，把大家引到现在的国家大事上”。这时，石家庄日报上开始登载“宋景诗与武训”的连环画，刘际魁准备好材料，瞅个空向大家说：“报上登着宋景诗与武训的连环画，净是古事，好得很！大家愿听不愿听？”其中有些上了岁数的人，过去听说过武训，但不知道宋景诗是干啥的，愿意叫刘际魁念念。刘际魁见大家都同意，便向大家念了连环画的说明文字。人们立刻议论开了。那些听说过武训的老年人说 ：“报上写得不对，武训是个好人，为了叫穷孩子上学，他要饭办学堂。”青年农民不服气地说：“报纸上不对那里对？现时的报纸啥时也没有说过瞎话。”刘际魁说：“武训办的学是私学，念书的都是些地主孩子，念的书也都是统治穷人的事。”他告诉大家，往后多念几天报，大家就明白了。几个晚上过去了，老乡们听得很起劲，天不黑，许多人就赶早来了。每次念完，大家总是你一言我一语地议论一阵，大多数都明白武训是个什么样的人了。农民何群说：“过去听人说武训是为穷人办学，听了几天报，我才知道武训又叫武豆沫，是地主的狗腿子。仗势欺人，放债租地，和咱们农民是两路人。”不少人也都感到每天晚上听听报可以长见识，比闲坐着抬死杠强多了。十月十三日，报纸上没有登连环画，老乡们很着急，都问：“下一回怎么啦”？刘禄子说：“没有连环画也别闲着，刘际魁是宣传员，给念念别的吧！报上登的大事多着哩！”刘际魁征得大家的同意，把报上登的关于朝鲜停战谈判的消息念给大家听，又把全国人民奋起抗美援朝的道理说了一遍。念完后，大家还照习惯议论了一阵。
        老乡们明白了国家大事，
    提早完成了捐献缴款
    大家听报有了兴趣，每晚来听报的人渐渐多起来了。六十多岁的杜老荣，也是每天必到。刘际魁见大家听报情绪越来越高，便根据大家的要求，有计划地加添政治、时事消息和本市的捐献消息。有一天晚上，他给大家读了“美帝国主义者承认自己在朝鲜的伤亡惨重，说朝鲜战争是个无底洞”的消息，张山保说：“咱们订的捐献计划争取早日完成吧！把飞机大炮赶快送上前线，早些打垮美帝国主义，叫咱们安心闹生产。”当场有三十多个老乡表示要提前完成捐献计划，并保证在十月底全部缴清。以后他们听到报上登了别的村庄提前完成捐献的消息后，都着了急，在十月中旬便把全部捐款提前缴清了。农民史顺来参加听报，解决了自己和全家的思想顾虑：他的侄子是个反革命分子，已被政府逮捕。史顺来和全家害怕连累自己，生产很不安心。十月三十一日晚，他听了“范村丁根深控诉他特务父亲的罪行”的消息，心里才豁亮了。他向大家说：“我听了丁根深的控诉，心里摸着底了，才知道人民政府的政策是谁犯罪镇压谁。”其他参加听报的农民，对听报也感到很大的兴趣。特别是关于苏联集体农庄农民用机器种地、用机器收割的事情，更使大家羡慕，议论不休。
        老乡们正式成立了读报组
    这个地方的老乡们，最近正式成立了读报组，刘际魁被选为组长，刘磨、刘际荣被选为读报员，分中午和晚上两起读报。读报组在赵陵铺村群众中威信很高。现在每天晚上参加读报的有四、五十人，有时到七、八十人。石家庄日报李丹江
    编辑部意见：党的宣传员刘际魁通过读报，提高了群众的觉悟，使他们由不问国事转变为热爱祖国。这件事实，生动地说明了读报组是适合广大群众需要的宣传形式之一，因此，党的宣传员应该紧紧地掌握这个武器。
    在广大的农村中和中小城市中，像“抬杠铺”这样的群众聚集的地方，是非常多的。当地党的宣传员，应该像刘际魁一样，以适合群众需要的方式，引导群众关心时事和政治，并在提高群众觉悟的基础上，把他们组织起来，进行经常的读报学习。这样做，不只可以保证各项工作能顺利完成，同时也可以更加密切党、政府和群众的关系。
