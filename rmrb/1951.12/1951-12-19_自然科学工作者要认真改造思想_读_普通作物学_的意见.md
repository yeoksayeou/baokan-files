    Natural Science Workers Should Conscientiously Transform Their Thinking
    -- Opinions on Reading "General Crop Science"
    Recently, I saw a book titled "General Crop Science" compiled by Zhang Jinxiang (printed by Xin Nong Publishing House, first edition in January 1951). There are some very absurd viewpoints in this book.
    The book says: "The reason why a country can become rich and strong depends solely on the development of production, and the way to production is primarily agriculture... The reason why Japan was once a hegemon in the world before the war (World War II) was all due to the revitalization of agriculture." Did Japan's rise come from the "revitalization of agriculture"? If this is not the editor's ignorance of politics, economics, and history, it is intentional distortion. More seriously, the editor actually referred to the once rampant and hegemonic Japanese fascism as "a hegemon in the world." I wonder what position the editor is taking?
    The book also says: If our country "encounters bad luck and a war occurs, and the source of food (referring to foreign imports - translator's note) is suddenly cut off, then the people's food problem will cause panic, and the people will inevitably fall into starvation..." This view is not worth refuting. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, our country's agricultural production has been improving step by step, and our country's food has been able to be self-sufficient. This is a well-known fact, but the author completely fails to see these facts.
    This book was published in 1951. According to the editor in the "Note Before Printing," this book was completed at the time of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but it was never printed. Before this printing, the "editorial department of Xin Nong Publishing House made appropriate revisions in order to match the current situation as much as possible." Some places also added materials after liberation (such as page 317). However, the facts prove that this book has not "matched the current situation as much as possible." Many places distort the facts and slander the Chinese people and the People's Government.
    From the above, it can be seen that the editor and reviser of this book still have many serious problems in their thinking. I think there are quite a few natural science workers in our country who have similar problems. Everyone should transform their thinking well in order to effectively serve the construction work of our great motherland. Yang Xing

### 自然科学工作者要认真改造思想——读“普通作物学”的意见

    自然科学工作者要认真改造思想
    ——读“普通作物学”的意见
    最近我看到一本张金相编的“普通作物学”（新农出版社印行，一九五一年一月初版）。这本书里有一些很荒谬的观点。
    书里说：“国家之所以能富强者，惟恃生产发达，生产之道，首推农业。……大战前（第二次世界大战）日本之称雄于世界者，皆因农业之振兴故也。”日本的兴起是因为“农业之振兴”吗？这如果不是编者对于政治、经济、历史的无知，就是有意歪曲。更严重的是，编者竟把日本法西斯的一度横行霸道，称为“称雄于全世界”，不知编者站在什么立场？
    书里又说：我国若“遇时运不佳，偶一发生战争，粮食来源（指外国进口——引者），忽而断绝，则民生之粮食问题，遂起恐慌，人民势必入于饥饿之途……”这种观点是不值一驳的。解放以来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，我国的农业生产步步提高，我国的粮食已能自给，这是众所周知的事，而作者却完全看不到这些事实。
    这本书出版于一九五一年，据编者在“付印前记”中说，这本书在抗日战争胜利时就已完稿，但始终没有付印。这次付印前曾经“由新农出版社编辑部予以酌量修补，务求尽可能配合目前情况”。其中有些地方还加入了解放以后的材料（如三一七页）。但是，事实证明，这本书是没有“尽可能配合目前情况”的，有许多地方是歪曲了事实，诬蔑了中国人民和人民政府。
    从上面这些地方，可以看出这本书的编者和修改者的思想上还有许多严重的问题。我觉得目前我国的自然科学工作者中间，有这类问题的并不少。大家应该好好地改造思想，才能有效地为我们伟大祖国的建设工作服务。　杨　星
