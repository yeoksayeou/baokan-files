    Administrative Leaders of Textile Industries in Various Regions Should Attach Importance to Promoting the "1951 Weaving Method"
    Simultaneously with the promotion of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," all textile factories will also promote the "1951 Weaving Method." All textile factories will launch a major production innovation movement centered on promoting these two important work methods. In this movement, the leading organs of the textile industry and the administrative aspects of factories in various regions should exert their utmost efforts to support the new work methods and ensure their universal implementation in all units.
    Some factory leaders believe that their factory's production is already doing quite well; or they believe that there isn't much new in the "1951 Weaving Method"; or they think that some of the advantages of the "1951 Weaving Method" already existed in their own factory. These complacent emotions and conservative ideas will hinder the smooth promotion of advanced work methods. First of all, it should be clearly recognized that the "1951 Weaving Method" is the crystallization of various excellent operating methods of weaving workers across the country. Of course, some of the advantages of these operating methods already existed in individual textile factories, but only by combining these advantages with other advantages can they play a greater role. The "1951 Weaving Method" is by no means just a simple combination of many good operating methods, but rather has been analyzed, sorted, and improved using scientific methods, therefore, it is already a completely new work method. Cadres and workers in any textile factory must recognize the superiority of the "1951 Weaving Method," which is the product of the collective wisdom of the masses. Secondly, it should also be recognized that the administrative leadership has the responsibility to make the new work method more enriched and improved in the process of its implementation. One of the important responsibilities of leaders is to keenly discover new things and promote their continuous growth. The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government pointed out in its instructions on promoting the "1951 Weaving Method": "Textile administrative departments in various regions should pay attention to continuing to study and improve the weaving method, organize technical personnel well, rely on workers, and conduct measurement and research work on new experiences at any time, so as to supplement the operating advantages of weaving workers in various regions into the '1951 Weaving Method'." This is very important.
    Textile industrial administrative departments and factory administrative aspects should actively support the promotion of new work methods. When starting to promote new work methods, because workers are not yet familiar with the new work methods, it may not be easy to see a significant increase in the quantity and quality of products for a while, and even temporary reductions are possible. Administrative leaders should treat such facts patiently and provide the pilot units with appropriate conveniences, assist trade unions and the masses of workers to smoothly promote new work methods, and fight against all kinds of conservative ideas and complacent emotions.

### 各地纺织工业行政领导干部应重视推广“一九五一织布工作法”

    各地纺织工业行政领导干部应重视推广“一九五一织布工作法”
    和推广“郝建秀工作法”同时，各纺织厂亦将推广“一九五一织布工作法”。各纺织厂将要以推广这两个重要的工作法为中心，开展一个生产上的大革新运动。在这个运动中，各地纺织工业领导机关和工厂行政方面，应该尽最大的力量，支持新的工作法，使之在各单位普遍贯彻执行。
    有些工厂的领导干部认为自己工厂的生产，已经搞得不坏了；或者认为“一九五一织布工作法”中，也没有太多新鲜东西；或者认为“一九五一织布工作法”中的某些优点，原是自己的工厂里就有的。这些自满情绪和保守思想，都会阻碍先进工作法的顺利推广。首先应该明确地认识，“一九五一织布工作法”是全国织布工人各种优良操作方法的结晶。其中某些操作法的优点，当然是在个别的纺织厂已经存在了的，但是，只有把这些优点和别的优点结合起来，才能发挥更大的作用。“一九五一织布工作法”绝不只是许多好的操作法的简单的结合，而是用科学的方法，分析、整理、提高了的，因此，它已经是一个全新的工作法了。任何一个纺织工厂的干部和工人，都必须认识集中群众高度智慧而产生的“一九五一织布工作法”的优越性。其次，还应该认识，行政领导方面有责任使新的工作法在推行过程中更加充实，更加提高。领导者的重要责任之一，就是锐敏地发现新鲜事物，并促使它不断的成长起来。中央人民政府纺织工业部在关于推行“一九五一织布工作法”的指示中指出：“各地纺织行政部门应注意继续研究和提高织布工作法，很好地组织技术人员，依靠工人，随时进行新经验的测定研究工作，以便将各地织布工人的操作优点，补充到‘一九五一织布工作法’中去。”这是十分重要的。
    纺织工业行政部门和工厂行政方面，应当主动地支持新工作法的推广。开始推广新工作法时，因为工人对新工作法还不熟习，可能一时不易看出产品数量、质量的显著的增进，甚至暂时还可能降低。行政领导方面应当耐心地对待这样的事实，并给予试行的单位以适当的便利条件，协助工会和工人群众顺利地推行新工作法，和各式各样的保守思想和自满情绪作斗争。
