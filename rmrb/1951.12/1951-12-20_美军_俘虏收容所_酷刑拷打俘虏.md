    US Military "Prisoner of War Camp" Tortures Prisoners
    Shen Jiran, Korean People's Army Soldier
    I was seriously wounded on the battlefield and lost consciousness. Several days later, I found myself lying in a cave at the foot of the mountain with unknown American black wounded soldiers. I realized something unusual had happened. The black wounded soldiers, covered in blood, were shouting and groaning loudly. My senses gradually returned, and I used cloth to bandage the wounds on my head and feet. When I stood up and tried to run out of the cave, the American soldier guarding the cave immediately ran over with his gun and started yelling. At this point, I knew I had become a prisoner of the American army and was under their surveillance. For two whole days, I lay in the cave without anything to eat, starving to the point of dizziness. A few days later, I was called in for "interrogation" by an American officer. Because I was seriously wounded, lost a lot of blood, and had been starving for days, I staggered a short distance and then collapsed. At this moment, the American devil poked me in the back with his gun, said something I couldn't understand, and then dragged me into the basement under the small hill. My clothes were stripped off, my hands were tied, and then he threatened me, saying, "If you don't tell us where the People's Army and Volunteer Army headquarters are located, we'll execute you on the spot." I replied that I didn't know. This clearly angered the American officer, and he ordered:
    "Teach him to be honest!" The Rhee Syngman puppet army soldier immediately hit my head with his rifle butt, knocking me to the ground, and then whipped my back with a rubber belt studded with nails. The pain was almost unbearable. However, I did not reveal a single word about the military secrets of my country.
    The American beasts continued to torture me with terrifying methods, trying to force military secrets from my mouth.
    The American devils took a red-hot piece of iron and branded the words
    "Red Bandit Rebel" on my chest, stabbed scissors into my fingernails, poured boiling water on me, then put a saw on my neck, forced me to lower my head, and said they would saw my head off. Later, they hung me on a tree....
    But the heroic People's Army soldier will never yield to torture, and the enemy got nothing.
    I escaped on a dark and rainy night in mid-August this year. The American devils guarding the prison, surrounded by barbed wire, were asleep. I took the opportunity to tightly strangle the guy's neck, and my comrades came to help me; the devil didn't even have time to scream before we strangled him to death. We crossed the barbed wire, traversed rugged and difficult mountains and valleys, and ran for twelve whole days, finally returning to the People's Army's defense zone.

    美军“俘虏收容所”酷刑拷打俘虏
    朝鲜人民军战士　申济然
    我在战场受了重伤，昏迷过去了。过了几天后，我才发觉自己和不相识的美国黑人伤兵一起躺在山下的地洞里，我意识到发生了不寻常的事情。满身鲜血的黑人伤兵大声叫着、呻吟着。我的感觉渐渐灵敏起来，我用布包扎了头部和脚部的伤口，站起来想往洞外跑，立刻，那看守地洞的美国兵就扛着枪跑来，哇哇大叫起来。这时，我知道自己已做了美军的俘虏，在他们监视之下了。整整两天，我躺在地洞里，什么东西也吃不到，饿得人发昏。过了几天，我被美国军官叫去“审问”。因为受了重伤，流血过多，又饿了几天，我摇摇晃晃地走了一段路就昏倒了。这时，美国鬼子用枪顶在我的背后，不知叽哩咕噜说了些什么，就生拉活扯地把我拖到了“审讯室”。在一张桌子上，摆着茶杯、水果和美国香烟，鹰鼻高个子的美国军官把饼干送到我面前要我吃，同时，就开始了“审问”。“审问”的要点是：人民军部队部署在什么地方？在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军多不多？……等等。我虽然一直因为口渴、肚子饿而十分难受，可是我决不愿拿饼干和水果吃。我知道，美国军官对我这种“待遇”，是要来收买我的，想从我身上得到一些军事机密。我断然拒绝回答他的“审问”。这时，他叫来一个高个子的李承晚伪军士兵，用英语讲了些什么，于是，我就被拉进小山丘下的地下室里，我的衣服被剥光，两只手被绑起，然后他威胁我说：“如果你不说出人民军和志愿军部队司令部的所在地，就把你就地枪毙。”我回答他不知道。这话分明触怒了那美国军官，他命令说：
    “教他老实点！”李承晚伪军士兵立刻用枪托打我的头，把我打得躺下去之后，又用装有铁钉的胶皮带抽打我的背部，我痛得几乎死去。然而祖国的军事机密，我一点也没有透露出来。
    美国野兽们继续用恐怖的酷刑来拷问我，企图从我的口中逼出军事秘密来。
    美国鬼子拿了一块烧红的铁片，在我的胸部划上
    “红匪叛乱者”字样，用剪刀刺进我的指甲里，又把沸水倒在我身上，接着把锯子放在我脖子上，强迫我低下头，说要把我的头锯断。以后又把我吊在树上……。
    可是英勇的人民军战士永远不为酷刑所屈，敌人什么也没有得到。
    我逃出来是在今年八月中旬一个漆黑的雨夜，看守周围满布铁丝网的牢房的美国鬼子睡觉了，我趁机紧勒住那家伙的脖子，同伴们也来帮助我；这个鬼子还没有来得及喊叫，就被我们扼死了。我们穿过铁丝网，越过崎岖难行的峻岭和溪谷，整整跑了十二天路，终于回到了人民军的防地。
