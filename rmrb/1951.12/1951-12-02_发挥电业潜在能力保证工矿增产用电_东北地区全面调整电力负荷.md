    Fully Exploit the Potential of the Electricity Industry to Ensure Increased Electricity for Industrial and Mining Production: Northeast China Comprehensively Adjusts Electrical Load
    The Northeast region is comprehensively adjusting its electrical load. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government made a decision on adjusting electrical load on November 2nd. The Northeast People's Government's People's Economic Planning Committee and the Industry Department jointly convened the Northeast Region Comprehensive Load Adjustment Conference on November 6th, mobilizing all electricity-using units to overcome difficulties and various ideological obstacles, and actively seek ways to adjust the load. The Northeast People's Government also issued a circular on adjusting electrical load on November 16th, calling on all departments, provincial and municipal people's governments, and people's organizations to earnestly implement the Northeast People's Government Industry Department's decision on adjusting electrical load.
    Since the full-scale launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in the Northeast, electricity consumption by industrial and mining enterprises has been continuously increasing. Currently, the maximum electrical load is approaching the limit of the electricity equipment's potential output. At the same time, winter has arrived, the days are short and the nights are long, and the amount of electricity used will continue to increase. If adjustments are not made in a timely manner, it will affect industrial and mining production and urban electricity use. Therefore, the Northeast Industry Department has decided to comprehensively adjust the electrical load. According to preliminary estimates, if the electrical load can be adjusted in a timely manner, keeping the maximum load of the power grid unchanged, and increasing the load factor by 5%, a huge amount of electricity can be added every day, opening up the road for the continued development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. At the same time, adjusting the electrical load can improve the utilization rate of electrical equipment and fully exploit the potential of the electricity industry. In the Shenyang area alone, if the load factor is increased by 6%, it would be equivalent to building a new power plant that would require hundreds of billions of yuan in state investment. From the perspective of the factory itself, adjusting the load can also reduce or eliminate the need to increase the capacity of the transformer equipment, thereby reducing the electricity preparation fees paid by factories and mines, which is beneficial to the economic accounting of the factories and mines themselves.
    Regarding methods for adjusting the load, the Northeast Industry Department's decision put forward five currently feasible methods. First, large electricity users should change the practice of taking full rest on Sundays and stagger the employees' days off. This can greatly reduce the electricity load on weekdays. Second, factories with two shifts should change their working hours to stagger the evening shift working hours from the urban lighting electricity consumption time, which can also reduce the maximum load. Third, equipment that does not operate continuously within the enterprise should be operated during low load times, and consumption should be avoided as much as possible during maximum load times. If the second and third measures are implemented, according to preliminary estimates, the maximum load can be reduced by about 4%. Fourth, factories with one shift should stipulate production time according to the principle of adjusting the load, so that production time and maximum load time do not overlap. Fifth, ordinary electricity users should, under the principle of not affecting production, change to operating outside of maximum load times. If each electricity-using unit can adjust according to the above principles, the maximum load within the power grid can be reduced by 7%.
    The Northeast Industry Department's decision and the Comprehensive Load Adjustment Conference both pointed out that when adjusting the load, it is first necessary to fully conduct ideological education among the employees on the political and economic significance of adjusting the load, because some employees still have some incorrect understandings about adjusting the load. For example, some people think that this is the Electricity Administration "looking for trouble", emphasizing their own difficulties, emphasizing that their unit uses less electricity, and are unwilling to make adjustments; some people think that this is the work of the Electricity Administration and has nothing to do with themselves; some people think that "the electricity industry should serve industrial and mining production, and industrial and mining enterprises should not have to accommodate the electricity industry"; or simply starting from reducing the preparation fees of their own unit, regardless of the adjustment of the maximum load, etc. Without overcoming these partial viewpoints and conservative ideas, adjusting the load cannot be thoroughly realized.

### 发挥电业潜在能力保证工矿增产用电  东北地区全面调整电力负荷

    发挥电业潜在能力保证工矿增产用电
    东北地区全面调整电力负荷
    东北地区正全面调整电力负荷。东北人民政府工业部于十一月二日作出了关于调整电力负荷的决定。东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会与工业部，于十一月六日联合召开了东北地区全面调整负荷大会，动员各用电单位克服困难和各种思想障碍，积极设法调整负荷。东北人民政府并于十一月十六日发出关于调整电力负荷的通令，号召各部门、各省市人民政府、各人民团体切实执行东北人民政府工业部调整电力负荷的决定。
    东北增产节约运动全面展开以后，工矿企业用电不断增加，目前用电的最大负荷已接近电力设备可能出力的极限。同时，冬季已到，天寒夜长，用电数量将继续增加，如果不能及时设法调整，将影响工矿业生产和城市用电。因之，东北工业部决定全面调整电力负荷。据初步估计，假如电力负荷能够及时调整，使电力网的最大负荷不变，而负荷率提高百分之五，每天就可以增加极大的发电量，为增产节约运动的继续开展开辟了道路。同时，调整电力负荷可以提高电力设备的利用率，充分发挥电业的潜在能力。单就沈阳地区说，负荷率如果提高百分之六，就等于新建立一个须要国家投资数百亿元的发电厂。就工厂内部讲，调整了负荷，也可以减少或不再增加变电设备的容量，因而减少厂矿支付的电力准备费，有利于厂矿本身的经济核算。
    关于调整负荷的办法，东北工业部的决定中提出了五条目前切实可行的办法。一、大电力用户改变星期日全部休息的办法，将职工公休时间错开。这样就可以大量减少平日的电力负荷。二、两班制的工厂改变作业时间，把晚班作业时间与城市照明用电时间错开，也可降低最大负荷。三、企业内不连续运转的设备改在低负荷时间运转，尽量避免在最大负荷时间内用电。如果实行了第二第三项措施，据初步估计，最大负荷即可减低百分之四左右。四、一班制的工厂，应根据调整负荷的原则规定生产时间，使生产时间和最大负荷时间不相重叠。五、普通电力用户，在不影响生产的原则下，改在最大负荷时间以外运转。各用电单位如能根据上述原则进行调整，将可降低电力网内最大负荷的百分之七。
    东北工业部的决定和全面调整负荷大会均指出，在调整负荷时，首先必须在职工中充分进行关于调整负荷的政治意义与经济意义的思想教育，因为若干职工对于调整负荷还存在一些不正确的认识。例如，有些人以为这是电业管理局“找麻烦”，强调自己的困难，强调本单位用电少，而不愿进行调整；有的人认为这是电业管理局的工作，与本身无关；有人认为“电力工业要为工矿生产服务，不应该让工矿企业迁就电业”；或者单纯从减少本单位的准备费出发，不顾最大负荷的调整等。不克服这些局部观点与保守思想，调整负荷就不可能彻底实现。（本报综合）
