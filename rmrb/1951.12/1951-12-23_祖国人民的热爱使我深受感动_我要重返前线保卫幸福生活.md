    The Motherland People's Love Deeply Moved Me
    I Want to Return to the Front Lines to Defend Happy Life
    Comrade Editor: We are volunteer soldiers recuperating somewhere. The love of the people of the motherland for us has truly moved us. Every time the children here come home from school, they come to see us. As soon as they arrive, they form a circle and dance, sing at the top of their voices, and finally rush up and hug us. The children sincerely ask us to go to their homes to tell their whole family the heroic stories of the volunteer soldiers and see their happy lives. To ask us to go to their homes, these lovely children innocently say: My family just bought a photo of Chairman Mao, Volunteer Army Uncle, go and take a look! If we agree to go to someone's house, they feel extremely honored.

    Once, a little schoolgirl named Song insisted on taking me to her home, and I agreed. The child's mother, Aunt Song, asked me all sorts of questions as soon as she saw me. She said, "You've finally come; if you hadn't come, this child would have made herself sick!" The whole family of five gathered around, asking me to tell them about the situation on the Korean battlefield. When I talked about the atrocities of the American army, the whole family gnashed their teeth and shed tears of grief and indignation.

    For the convenience of recuperation, the superiors asked us to transfer to another hospital. We tried our best to keep this news a secret, but the children found out anyway. The little girl named Song specially bought four packs of cigarettes and three boxes of matches for us. Two tear tracks ran down her kind face as she innocently said, "Why are you leaving so soon after arriving? Are the people here not treating you well enough?" I explained the reason for our transfer to her, and her expression calmed down a bit. I comforted her, saying, "We will have a chance to meet again in the future. I hope you go back and study hard." The child's face began to show a smile, saying, "People here don't want you to leave..."

    Children have a passion for peace, and therefore love the soldiers who defend peace. I have nothing else to offer but to recuperate peacefully, abide by the hospital rules, obey the treatment, so that my body can recover as soon as possible, return to the front lines, and defend the happy lives of the children!

### 祖国人民的热爱使我深受感动  我要重返前线保卫幸福生活

    祖国人民的热爱使我深受感动
    我要重返前线保卫幸福生活
    编辑同志：我们是在某地休养的志愿军战士。祖国人民对我们的热爱，实在使我们感动。这里的孩子们每逢下学回家，都要到我们这里来看看。他们一来，就围成圈子跳舞，拉开嗓子唱歌，最后一拥而上，把我们抱住。孩子们诚心地要求我们到他们的家里去，向他们全家讲志愿军的英雄故事，看看他们家中的幸福生活。为了要求我们到他们家里去，这些可爱的孩子们天真地说：俺家新买了一张毛主席的照片，志愿军叔叔去看看吧！我们要是答应到谁家去的话，谁就感到无尚的光荣。
    有一次，一位姓宋的小女学生，硬要拉着我到她家里去，我答应了。孩子的母亲——宋大娘，一见我就问长问短。她说：“可来了，要再不来，就要把俺这孩子气病了！”全家五口人都围拢来，要我给他们讲朝鲜战场的情形。当我谈到美军的暴行时，全家人都咬牙切齿，淌出悲愤的眼泪。
    为了养病的方便，上级让我们转院。这个消息，我们极力保持秘密，但也被这群孩子知道了。那位姓宋的小姑娘特地买了四包香烟、三盒火柴送给我们。她和蔼的面庞上划出两条泪痕，天真地说：“怎么刚来就又走？俺这里的人对您们招待不周到吗？”我向她解释了我们转院的原因，她的神情镇静了一些。我安慰她说：“以后我们还有见面的日子，望你回去好好读书。”孩子的脸上才开始露出了笑容说：“我们这里的人，都不愿意您们走……。”
    孩子们酷爱和平，因此也热爱保卫和平的战士。我没有别的，只有安心休养，遵守院规，服从治疗，使我的身体早日恢复健康，重返前线，保卫孩子们的幸福生活！
