Party Life

    After Receiving Communist Education
    Related by Lin Yizhi, Recorded by Zhao Shilie

    I am a Communist Party member from a poor peasant background. I have been engaged in agricultural labor since I was a child and only studied for four years. I joined the Communist Party in 1947. When I joined the Party, my understanding of the Party's nature was vague. I mistakenly thought that the Communist Party was the "party of the poor." After joining the Party, although I also knew that the Communist Party's goal was to achieve communism, I was unclear about what communism was and how to achieve a communist society. Therefore, after the national liberation, I was overwhelmed by victory. Although I also knew that the Chinese revolution had to continue after the victory, I felt that what Chairman Mao said about the past work being only the first step of a long march was an exaggeration. I thought that the revolution had been victorious, the power was in the hands of the people, and we could do whatever we wanted from now on, and the revolution was at least more than half completed.
    After arriving in Shanghai, I was surrounded by tall buildings, electric lights and telephones, cars, and trams. It was as if you could have anything you wanted. At this time, I forgot that we still had to implement communism in the future, and I thought that the current life was already very good. I thought that when we enter a socialist society in the future, Chairman Mao will lead us, and I don't need to worry about it. I can just follow along. I hope to enjoy more of the present. Although I also know that the future communist society will be better than the present, "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." I feel that now is good enough.
    However, I gradually became dissatisfied with this kind of "enjoyment." I saw that some comrades and some new cadres were on a salary system, and their lives were better than mine. They had everything from fountain pens to watches. I had nothing but an old fountain pen. My quilt was still brought from the countryside, not as beautiful as the ones they had on their beds. Although I also knew that this kind of thinking was wrong and wanted to overcome it, I always felt that doing revolutionary work was a "real loss" when I encountered specific problems. Sometimes, when I saw in the newspaper that the revolutionary task had not been completed and that revolutionary cadres should maintain a style of hard work and plain living and continue to work hard, I felt that these were just "old clichés."
    I recall that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was not afraid of anything when fighting guerrilla warfare in the dark. I wore a tattered cotton-padded coat and never complained. In 1947, when the enemy attacked Jiaodong, the higher authorities entrusted me with preserving many valuable materials. I discarded my own old things and cleared out the cave to store public materials. I never thought of embezzling anything. After the entire Jiaodong region was liberated, the higher authorities gave me a material reward for preserving the materials, but I refused, saying, "This is a Party member's duty." Why did I become like this after arriving in Shanghai? I thought about it again and again, but I couldn't figure it out.
    After studying communist theory at the Shanghai Municipal Party School, I realized that the above ideas were all wrong. This study has benefited me the most:
    1. Comrade Xia Yan's report introduced the situation of Soviet socialist industry, agriculture, and people's lives. After watching Soviet movies several times
    (introducing Soviet collective farms and factories), I had a deep impression of the production and life of socialist and communist societies. In the past, although I had heard that the production and life of the Soviet people were good, I didn't know exactly how good they were. This time, I saw in the movies the rows of tractors, which plowed over a large area of land as soon as they were turned on. Thinking about my past farming, holding a hoe and "gnawing" (meaning digging) bit by bit, I could only clear a small piece of land in a day, and my hands were covered with calluses and blisters. Looking at the farmers of the Soviet collective farms, how good their lives are! When they are resting, they are dressed in red and green, jumping and dancing. It is really a happy world. When I saw the transportation vehicles of the collective farm, I thought of my deceased father. He used to work as a long-term worker for the landlord. When he carried things, he didn't have enough strength, and his ribs were broken by the mule basket. He died soon after. The farmers of the Soviet collective farms not only have cars to transport things, but the cars are also equipped with automatic machinery. Loading and unloading things does not require manpower. As long as the machine is turned on, things will automatically go up and down. In addition, my hometown has many mountains, and in the past, I always thought that tractors could not be used for farming. This time, I saw in the movie that the huge excavator smoothed out the small slopes and ditches on the ground as soon as it was turned on. In this way, tractors can also be used in my hometown in the future. All of these greatly increased my enthusiasm for fighting for socialist and communist society.
    2. Comrade Liu Ruilong's report on "From New Democratic Society to Socialist Society" also gave me a lot of inspiration. Before going south, I had heard Comrade Liu Ruilong's report. I remember that he said at that time: "After going south to the city, revolutionary cadres should maintain their style of hard work and plain living." At that time, I thought, after so many years of hard life, can I still be confused by city life? Who knew that as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, I was confused by the colorful world. This time, Comrade Liu Ruilong said to us again: "Some comrades think that the military victory has been won, the land reform has been completed, and the power has been grasped in their own hands, so the revolution is completed. They don't know that the Chinese revolution has not yet achieved its final victory. At present, we should still struggle to consolidate and develop the construction of new democracy, and in the future, we will struggle to transition to socialism and communism." I was very excited when I heard it. It seems that these words are specifically addressed to me. I really want to run to the stage and make a self-criticism to him in person. I feel deeply ashamed. How can a communist party member become such a petty and short-sighted person who is calculating personal interests!
    In the group discussion, I more clearly realized that a communist party member should be a person with special qualities, who should "endure hardship before enjoying happiness" and lead the people to embark on a socialist and communist society. Only in socialist and communist societies will there be no classes or exploitation; everyone can live a happy life. But such a good society cannot be achieved without the leadership of the Communist Party and the leading efforts of Communist Party members. This is why the title of Communist Party member is glorious.
    I think of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is still living a hard life, and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, who are still fighting heroically with the enemy, and I feel that I should work harder to move forward.
    I examine that the reason why I had such incorrect ideas in the past was mainly because I didn't study enough—especially I didn't study communism systematically enough, and many narrow peasant consciousnesses have not been overcome. I am determined to take this study as a turning point in my ideological development. From now on, I will try my best to overcome incorrect ideas, raise myself to the level of a communist party member, and strive to consolidate the victory of new democracy, and strive for China's transition to socialism and the final construction of a communist system.

    受了共产主义教育以后
    林一志 述  赵时烈 记
    我是贫农出身的共产党员，从小就从事农业劳动，只读过四年书。一九四七年参加共产党。当我入党时，我对党的性质的认识是模糊的。我错误地认为共产党是“穷人的党”。入党后，虽然也知道了共产党的奋斗目标是实现共产主义，但什么叫共产主义，怎样实现共产主义社会，都认识不清。所以当全国解放后，我就被胜利冲昏了头脑。虽然我也知道胜利后中国革命还要继续前进，可是，认为毛主席所说的过去的工作只不过像万里长征走完了第一步，却未免形容过分。我认为革命胜利了，政权在人民手里，今后想怎么做就可以怎么做，革命至少可说已经完成大半了。
    到上海后，满眼是高楼大厦、电灯电话、汽车、电车，真是要啥有啥。这时候，我就忘记了将来还要实行共产主义，认为眼前的生活，已经很美了。我想，将来进入社会主义社会，自有毛主席领导，不用我操心，跟着走就可以，眼前倒希望多享受享受。我虽然也知道将来的共产主义社会要比现在好，但是“千羊在望，不如一兔在手”，我觉得现在就可以了。
    但是，对这样的“享受”，慢慢地又不满起来了。我看到有的同志和某些新干部，都是薪金制，他们的生活比我好，钢笔手表样样齐全。我自己除了一支旧钢笔外，别的什么也没有。被子还是从农村里带来的，不像他们床上铺的那样漂亮。虽然我也知道这种想法是错误的，想克服它，但接触到具体问题时，老觉得干革命工作“真吃亏”。有时看到报上再三指出：革命任务还没有完成，革命干部要保持艰苦朴素的作风，要继续努力前进，可是在我觉得这些都是“老生常谈”。
    我回想抗日战争时，黑夜里打游击，什么也不怕。身上穿着破棉袄，也从来没有嫌不好。一九四七年敌人进攻胶东时，上级把许多贵重物资交我保存，我把自家的破旧东西丢开，空出坑洞放公家的物资，我从不想贪污一点东西。胶东全境解放后，上级因我保留物资有功，发给我物质奖，我不要，曾经说过：“这是党员应尽的义务。”怎么到上海后就变成了这个样子呢？我自己想来想去，总想不通。
    在上海市委党校学习了共产主义的理论以后，知道了以上的想法都是错误的。这次学习，使我得益最深的是：
    一、夏衍同志的报告，介绍了苏联社会主义的工业、农业和人民生活情形。又看了好几次苏联电影
    （介绍苏联集体农庄和工厂的），就使我对社会主义及共产主义社会的生产和生活，有了深刻的印象。过去虽然也听说苏联人民的生产和生活都美，但不知道到底怎么样好法。这次在电影上看到那成排的拖拉机，一开过去，一大片土地就翻过来了；想想自己过去种地，拿着镢头，一下一下地“啃”
    （刨的意思），一天才能开出一小块土地，还弄得满手硬茧、血泡。再看看苏联集体农庄的农民，生活多好呀，他们在休息的时候，一个个穿红披绿，跳呀舞呀，那真是个快乐世界。我看到集体农庄的运输车，就想起了死去的父亲。他过去给地主当长工，扛了东西，力气不足，一下被骡篓压断了肋骨，不久就死了。苏联集体农庄农民不但有汽车运东西，而且车子上还装着自动机械，装卸东西都不用人力，只要机器一开动，东西就自动地上去下来。另外，我家乡山地多，过去总认为不能用拖拉机耕种，这次在电影上看到那巨大的铲掘机一开动，那些地上的小坡小沟都平了，这样看，自己家乡将来也是可以用拖拉机的。所有这些大大地提高了我为社会主义和共产主义社会奋斗的热情。
    二、刘瑞龙同志关于“从新民主主义社会到社会主义社会”的报告，给我的启发也很大。南下前，我曾经听过刘瑞龙同志的报告，我记得他那时曾说过：“南下到城市以后，革命干部应保持自己的艰苦朴素作风。”那时，我认为过了这么些年的艰苦生活，还能被城市生活迷惑住吗？那知一到上海，就被花花世界迷惑住了。这次刘瑞龙同志又对我们说：“有些同志认为军事上胜利了，土地改革完成了，政权已握在自己手里，革命就算完成了。不知道中国革命还没有最后胜利，目前还应该为巩固和发展新民主主义的建设而斗争，将来为转变到社会主义和共产主义而斗争。”我听了心里很激动。好像这些话是专对着我说的，我真想跑上台去向他当面检讨检讨。我深深感到惭愧，作为一个共产党员，怎么竟变成这样一个斤斤计较个人利益、眼光短小的庸人呢！
    在小组讨论中，我更明确认识了共产党员应该是具有特殊品质的人，应该“吃苦在前、享福在后”带领人民群众，走上社会主义和共产主义的社会。只有到了社会主义和共产主义社会，才不会有阶级、有剥削；大家才能过美满幸福的生活。但这样美好的社会，如果没有共产党的领导，共产党员的带头努力，是不可能达到的，共产党员的称号所以光荣，原因就在这里。
    我想到中国人民解放军，还过着艰苦的生活，朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军，还在英勇地和敌人搏斗，我就更觉得应该努力前进了。
    我检讨我过去所以会产生这样不正确的思想，主要是因为学习不够——特别是对于共产主义的系统学习不够，许多狭隘的农民意识还没有克服。我决心把这次学习作为思想发展上的一个转折点。从此，我将尽力克服不正确的思想，把自己提高到共产党员的水平，为巩固新民主主义的胜利而奋斗，为中国转变到社会主义和最后建设共产主义制度而奋斗。
