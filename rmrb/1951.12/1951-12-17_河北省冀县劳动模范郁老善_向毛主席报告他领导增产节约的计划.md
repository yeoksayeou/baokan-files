Reports to Chairman Mao on His Plan to Lead Increased Production and Thrift

Respected Chairman Mao:

You led us to overthrow the ferocious enemy, enabling the people of the whole country to stand up, build national defense, economy, and culture, and give China a new look. Therefore, we must unite around you and follow you on the road to light.

I hope you received the letter I sent you a few days ago. Now I will tell you about the production situation in my village this year. First, let's talk about this year's cotton. Because of aphids, the average yield per mu was 105 jin. When controlling aphids, I mobilized all party members, cadres, and the masses to treat them. This protected the cotton seedlings. During the aphid control period, I led the farmers to use solid cotton oil emulsion. In addition to supplying the whole village, we also supplied it to neighboring villages. Let’s talk about the harvest of millet. Everyone planted Huanong No. 4 millet, with an average yield of 286 jin per mu. Wheat averaged 130 jin per mu. Chinese yams yielded 2,600 jin per mu. All 37 mutual aid teams and 136 households in the village participated in the mutual aid teams. Especially when it was about to freeze the land, the higher authorities called on us to plow the land once before the ground froze. At this time, the work allocation team played a significant role, ensuring completion in three days, November 27, 28, and 29.

Now, I will report to you on the situation after returning from the provincial meeting:

After I returned, with the help of the leaders of the special zone and county levels, I consolidated the existing Second District Labor Model Liaison Network and decided to implement the call for increased production and thrift in the 63 villages in my district, making my district a model rich production area. After returning to the village, I convened a branch meeting to discuss the organization of an agricultural producers' cooperative. At that time, five people signed up. Two at the party meeting and three at the mass meeting. Now the cooperative has 10 households, 37 people, 173 mu of land, and four and a half livestock. We plan to raise a flock of sheep this winter, on the one hand to create fertilizer to support agricultural production, and on the other hand to serve as a winter sideline occupation. We also plan to dig two wells to develop 60 to 70 mu of paddy fields. In this way, we can also prevent severe drought. Our approach is from point to surface, first, we take the lead in gaining experience, and then develop the entire village collectively. Now, in addition to the agricultural producers' cooperative, we will continue to consolidate other mutual aid teams as a bridge to collectivization.

In terms of production, we plan to increase the yield per unit area next year. We will not focus on increasing the number of mu, but on increasing the yield per mu, so that next year will be a bumper year.

In terms of thrift, after my propaganda, many people have also responded to this call. My daughter-in-law wore floral serge last year, but now she has changed to floral cotton cloth clothes. For example, after Liu Laopin in our village died, they originally planned to spend more than a dozen bags of wheat to buy a coffin; eight musicians would use a bag of wheat to get through this matter. Now, only three and a half bags were used. The coffin was worth only three bags of wheat, and one dou of wheat was used to pay the four musicians. Also, Liu Jifu originally planned to build a house, but now he is not building it, and is using the surplus strength to accumulate fertilizer for increased production. For example, elementary school teachers are also calling on children to fill small characters in large blank spaces, thus saving paper. These are our specific thrift practices.

In addition, I will give a brief report on the reading group and people's school in our village. In this regard, I have also made the greatest efforts to help them mobilize students and study the Marriage Law regularly this winter. We also proposed that the people's school and the reading group should have one stove, which is also for the sake of thrift.

I also proposed to everyone in the village: if we want to do a good job, all the cadres must be well connected. If we want to improve production, we must mobilize the broad masses of women to participate. After writing this, I hope Chairman Mao will give more guidance and criticism. I will write to you again to report on future progress.

            I wish you a happy spirit and good health.

### 河北省冀县劳动模范郁老善  向毛主席报告他领导增产节约的计划

    河北省冀县劳动模范郁老善
    向毛主席报告他领导增产节约的计划敬爱的毛主席：
    你领导我们打倒了凶恶的敌人，使全国人民都翻了身，建设了国防、经济和文化，使我国出现了新的面貌。所以我们要团结在你的周围，跟着你向光明的道路前进。
    在前几天，我给你的信收见了吧。现在我再把我村今年的生产情况告诉你。首先说今年的棉花吧，因生了蚜虫，全村平均每亩产一百零五斤。在治蚜虫时，我发动了全体党员干部和群众，都来治蚜。这样保住了棉苗。在治蚜虫期间，我领导农民，配合固体棉油乳剂，除供全村用外，还供给片村来用。再说谷子的收成吧，大家都种的华农四号谷，每亩平均产二百八十六斤。小麦平均每亩产一百三十斤。山药每亩产二千六百斤。全村三十七个互助组，一百三十六户都参加了互助组。特别在将近封地的时候，上级号召我们，在上冻前，把地普耕一遍。在这时，拨工组起了很大的作用，保证在十一月二十七、二十八、二十九三天完成。
    现在，我再把赴省回来后的情况，报告给你：
    我回来后，由专区和县级各首长的帮助，我巩固了旧有的二区劳动模范联络网，并决定把增产节约的号召贯彻到我区六十三个村中去，使我区成为一个丰产模范区。我回村后，召开了支部会，研究讨论组织土地合作社。在当时，就有五个报名的。在党的会上有两个，在群众会上有三个。现在全社共有十户，三十七人，一百七十三亩地，四个半牲口。计划在今冬养一圈羊，一方面造肥支持农业生产，另一方面还作为冬季副业。并且还计划打两眼井，发展六、七十亩水地。这样，还可以防备大旱。我们这一些做法，是由点到面，先由我们带头做出经验，再发展全村集体。现在除土地合作社外，其他的互助组，我们还要继续巩固，作为走向集体的桥梁。
    在生产上，计划明年提高单位面积的产量。在亩数上不多，着重了每亩多收，使明年成为丰产年。
    在节约方面，经过我的宣传，有许多群众也纷纷响应了这一号召。我的儿妇，去年穿花哔叽，现在也改为花洋布衣服了。又如我村刘老聘死后，先计划花十几口袋麦子买一个棺材；八名吹鼓手用一口袋麦子，过这个事。现在，只用了三口袋半。就是三口袋麦子的棺材，一斗麦子写了四名吹鼓手。还有刘继芾，打算盖房，现在也不盖了，把节余的力量，用到积肥丰产方面。如小学教员，也号召儿童，在大仿空间填写小字，这样节省纸。这都是我们节约的具体做法。
    另外，我再把我村读报组和民校，做一简单的报告。在这方面，我也做了最大的努力，帮他们动员学员，并研究在今冬经常贯彻婚姻法。又提出民校和读报组生一个炉子，这也是为了节约。
    我在村里还向大家提出：要想把工作做好，必须各个干部联系好。要想搞好生产，必须动员广大的妇女也来参加。写了这些，希毛主席多指教与批评。今后做的情况，我再写信报告给你。
            祝你精神愉快身体健康
