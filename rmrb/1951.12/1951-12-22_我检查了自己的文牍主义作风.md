    I Examine My Own Bureaucratic Work Style
    Comrade Editor: I am new to clerical work and thought that I knew nothing about old official documents and would certainly not have a bureaucratic work style. However, after seeing the anti-bureaucratic official document exhibition, I realized that I had unknowingly fallen into the trap of bureaucracy in some areas. This is manifested in: First, I thought that we were no longer in the guerrilla environment where problems were solved with two-finger-wide strips of paper, and that we should be more "formal." However, I could not distinguish the scope of "formal," so I thought that everything, no matter how big or small, had to be handled with formal official documents. Second, even for small matters with leaders whom I see every day in the office, I would write reports; I would write memos for handling daily affairs, constantly using pens and paper, simply losing the function that the mouth should have, making the leaders busy reading, signing, and approving. This is caused by the fear of taking responsibility. All of this is inconsistent with the spirit of streamlining, economizing, and improving work efficiency. I hope that comrades who have seen the exhibition will examine whether they have committed bureaucracy in their work and be vigilant at all times. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out this movement in every organization.

### 我检查了自己的文牍主义作风

    我检查了自己的文牍主义作风
    编辑同志：我是初作文书工作的，自以为对旧的公文一点不懂，决不会有文牍主义作风。但看了反文牍主义公文展览以后，才发觉自己有些地方是在不知不觉中钻进了文牍主义的圈子。这表现在：一、以为现在已经不是用二指宽的纸条解决问题的游击环境了，应该“正规”一点。但并不能区别“正规”的范围，因此事无大小，都认为非办正式公文不可。二、对在机关内部天天见面的首长，即使一点小事，也要写报告；处理日常事务要写签条，动不动就是用笔、用纸，简直是失去了嘴应有的作用，使首长忙于阅、签、批。这是怕负责任的思想作怪。这都是和精简节约、提高工作效率的精神不符的。我希望看过展览会的同志，都检查一下自己在工作中是否犯了文牍主义，随时加以警惕。同时，在每个机关里开展这个运动也是必要的。
