    In order to strengthen grain procurement work, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office has organized the forces of the state-owned grain companies, cooperatives, transportation, and shipping departments throughout the region to cooperate closely under unified leadership in carrying out procurement and transportation work. In the past grain procurement work in Southern Jiangsu, the relevant departments each had their own plans, and there was insufficient mutual coordination. The grain companies felt that manpower and material resources were insufficient, and the cooperatives felt that there was a lack of funds. In some places, grain companies and cooperatives carried out procurement simultaneously, but the standards and prices were inconsistent. In terms of transportation, various localities only controlled transportation tools according to their own needs, so they could not be uniformly deployed. In order to change this situation, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office convened a joint meeting of responsible persons from relevant units in late November, deciding that all cooperative federations above the county level, in addition to mobilizing all grassroots societies to actively carry out rice deposit and fertilizer pre-sale business, should handle all grain purchase and sale business on behalf of state-owned grain companies. The purchase funds will be remitted by the state-owned grain companies on time, and the cooperatives will settle accounts in a timely manner, with deposits not exceeding three days at most, to avoid capital backlog. In terms of grain supply, the cooperatives will make plans in advance on a county basis, and the state-owned grain companies will transfer them on schedule. In this way, both the stability of grain prices can be guaranteed, the cooperative's funding problems can be solved, and the supply of fertilizer to the members can also be guaranteed. The grain company also decided to strengthen the leadership of transportation work, shorten the time for grain loading and unloading and turnover, and complete the transportation plan on schedule. The planned transportation volume of the state-owned grain company in Southern Jiangsu in December will be three to four times higher than in November. Previously, it took three days to load and four days to unload, but now it is planned to load in two days and unload in two days. Previously, ships from Wuxi to Shanghai took an average of twenty days to one month for each round trip, but now it is necessary to strive to shorten it to one week to ten days.

    苏南行政公署财经委员会加强对粮食收购工作的领导
    为加强粮食收购工作，苏南人民行政公署财政经济委员会已把全区国营粮食公司、合作社和交通、运输部门的力量组织起来，在统一领导下，密切配合，进行收购和运输工作。苏南区在过去收购粮食工作中，有关部门各有各的计划，互相配合不够。粮食公司感到人力、物力不足，合作社感到资金缺乏。有的地方粮食公司和合作社同时收购，标准和价格却不一致。运输方面，各地仅根据本身需要，掌握交通工具，因而不能统一调运。为了改变这种情况，苏南人民行政公署财政经济委员会在十一月下旬召集各有关单位负责人举行联席会议，决定各县级以上合作总社除动员各基层社积极开展稻谷存实和预售肥料业务外，要全部为国营粮食公司办理粮食代购、代售业务。代购资金由国营粮食公司按时拨汇，合作社要及时结账，存款至多不超过三天，避免资金积压。粮食供应方面，合作社将以县为单位预作计划，由国营粮食公司按期调运。这样，既可保证粮价稳定，合作社资金问题又可以得到解决，社员肥料供应也有保证。粮食公司并决定加强对运输工作的领导，缩短粮食装卸和周转时间，按期完成调运计划。苏南区国营粮食公司十二月份计划运输量将比十一月份提高三倍到四倍。以前须装三天卸四天，现在计划做到装两天卸两天；以前船只从无锡到上海每次来往平均要二十天到一个月，现在要争取缩短为一星期到十天。
