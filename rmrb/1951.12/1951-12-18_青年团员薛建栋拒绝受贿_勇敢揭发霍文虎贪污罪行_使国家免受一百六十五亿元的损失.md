    Youth League Member Xue Jiandong Refuses Bribe, Bravely Exposes Huo Wenhus Embezzlement, Saving the State from a Loss of 16.5 Billion Yuan
    Xue Jiandong (Youth League member), a staff member of the Qingjian County People's Bank in Shaanxi Province, has a firm revolutionary stance. He refused to accept a bribe from the embezzler Huo Wenhu and reported Huo's serious embezzlement crimes to his superiors, saving the state a huge fortune of more than 16.5 billion yuan.
    The perpetrator Huo Wenhu is 21 years old this year, from Cangtou Village, Miyun County, Hebei Province, with a landlord background. In 1949, he studied at the North China People's Revolutionary University.
    The facts and attempts of Huo's theft of state property, according to the preliminary interrogation by the Qingjian County People's Court and the evidence handed over by Huo, are as follows:
    In early October of this year, while the head of the Qingjian County People's Bank went to Suide to attend a meeting, Huo stole the bank's external business seal, steel stamp, and the responsible person's personal seal to his dormitory. He also took out bills of exchange and issued fifty bills of exchange to Xi'an, Fenyang, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Beijing, Shenyang, Hankou, Shanghai and other places, totaling 15.3855 billion yuan. There were also four postal remittances, totaling 1.19 billion yuan. These two remittances lacked only the bank director's signature and secret code procedures. There was also a bill of exchange for 9 million yuan to the Xi'an People's Bank business department, for which the bank director's signature (he imitated the bank director's handwriting) and secret code procedures were completed. The above three items totaled 16.584 billion yuan. In addition, when Huo worked at the Suide Central Sub-branch in the past, he embezzled more than 14 million yuan, of which 3.5 million yuan has already been remitted. Huo planned to complete the procedures for these bills of exchange and remit them, then escape according to the pre-determined route. First, he would withdraw the money in various cities and deposit it in state banks to generate interest; then, he would transfer to small or large cities and hide in schools. To realize this shameful criminal plan, Huo stole more than one million yuan of private deposits from the bank in advance, sewed a suit of plain clothes, and prepared to wear them when he escaped. He also carved three false name seals (Zhang Guangji, Xia Sheng, Zhang Xiaoming) to use when withdrawing money in the above-mentioned locations.
    Huo had the intention of stealing state property very early on. When he first arrived at the Qingjian County People's Bank, he learned the bank director's signature handwriting and prepared the keys to the custody box. In October, he gave Youth League member Xue Jiandong a stack of bills, attempting to win Xue over to run away with him. Because Xue Jiandong had been educated and cultivated by the Party and the Youth League and had a firm stance, he did not fall into his trap and reported it to the leading comrades. After the administrative side and Party organization in the bank investigated the above facts, they convened a meeting of all bank cadres on the 20th, exposed Huo's criminal attempts and facts of stealing state property, and handed him over to the county people's court for detention and handling that day.
    The Qingjian County People's Court is continuing to interrogate this case. The Shaanxi Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China has sent special personnel to assist in the handling. The Supervisory Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government has instructed the Suide Special District Supervisory Office and the Qingjian County People's Government Supervisory Committee to send people to assist in the handling.

    青年团员薛建栋拒绝受贿  勇敢揭发霍文虎贪污罪行
    使国家免受一百六十五亿元的损失
    陕西省清涧县人民银行工作人员薛建栋（青年团员），革命立场坚定，拒绝接受贪污分子霍文虎的贿赂，向上级报告了霍犯的严重贪污罪行，为国家保存了一百六十五亿多元的巨额财富。
    霍犯文虎今年二十一岁，河北省密云县仓头村人，地主成分，一九四九年曾在华北人民革命大学学习。
    霍犯偷盗国家财产的事实和企图，根据清涧县人民法院初步审问和霍犯交出的证据，情况如下：
    今年十月初，霍犯乘清涧县人民银行行长去绥德开会，把对外营业的行章、钢印和负责人的私章，偷到宿舍，又取出汇票，开了汇往西安、汾阳、太原、石家庄、天津、北京、沈阳、汉口、上海等地的五十张汇票，共一百五十三亿八千五百万元。另有信汇四张，共十一亿九千万元。这两宗汇款，只缺行长的签字和密押手续。还有汇往西安人民银行营业部的九百万元的一张汇票，行长签字（是他套的行长的笔迹）和密押手续都办好了。以上三宗共一百六十五亿八千四百万元。另外，霍犯过去在绥德中心支行工作的时候，曾经贪污了一千四百多万元，已经汇出三百五十万元。霍犯打算把这些汇票手续办好汇出去以后，就按照预定的路线脱逃。先到各城市取出款子，存入国家银行生利息；然后转到小城市或大城市，混到学校里隐蔽起来。霍犯为了实现这个可耻的犯罪计划，事前偷了行内私人存款一百多万元，缝了一身便衣，准备脱逃的时候穿。又刻了三个假名私章（张广辑、夏生、张晓铭），准备到以上各地取款的时候用。
    霍犯很早就有了偷盗国家财产的企图。他初到清涧县人民银行，就学行长的签字笔迹，配制管押箱的钥匙。十月间，他给青年团员薛建栋一把票子，企图拉拢薛建栋和他一起逃跑。薛建栋因为受了党和青年团的教育培养，立场坚定，没有上他的圈套，并且报告给领导同志。行内行政方面和党的组织查清上述事实以后，在二十日召开了全行干部会议，揭露了霍犯偷盗国家财产的罪恶企图和事实，当天送交县人民法院关押处理。
    清涧县人民法院还在继续审问这件案子。中国人民银行陕西省分行已经派专人去帮助处理。陕西省人民政府监察委员会已经分别指示绥德专区监察处和清涧县人民政府监察委员会派人协助处理。
