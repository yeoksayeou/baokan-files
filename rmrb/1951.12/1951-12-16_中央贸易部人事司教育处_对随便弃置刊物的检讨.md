    The Education Section of the Personnel Department of the Central Trade Ministry
    Self-Criticism Regarding the Careless Discarding of Publications
    Comrade Editor: The "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily published on November 28th contained a letter criticizing our section for the wasteful phenomenon of collecting publications from various organs. This criticism is correct. In addition to sincerely accepting it and striving to correct it, we offer the following self-criticism:
    When our section established the Local Publications Guidance Section last year, it did not give it thorough consideration and simply issued a notice to all state-owned trade organizations nationwide, instructing them to send five copies of all their publications on a regular basis. Later, this section was abolished, and the work was suspended. However, our section neither notified the publishing units to stop sending publications, nor did it promptly dispose of the old publications, resulting in waste. This is a concrete manifestation of our insufficient attention to state property and a lack of responsibility, reflecting bureaucratic work style. It also shows that our section still has blindness in its work. After the abolition of the Local Publications Guidance Section, our section transferred the above work to the Editorial Section of the Secretariat on October 24th. This section is currently studying and handling this work. In the future, our section will strengthen the planning in our work and check our work at any time to prevent similar waste from happening again.

### 中央贸易部人事司教育处  对随便弃置刊物的检讨

    对随便弃置刊物的检讨
    编辑同志：十一月二十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载了读者来信，对我处征集机关刊物发生浪费现象，提出批评。这一批评是正确的。我们除诚恳接受、努力改正外，并作如下检讨：
    我处在去年成立地方刊物指导科时，并没有经过详密考虑，就通令全国国营贸易机构，把所出各种刊物按期寄送五份。后来这个科取消，工作已陷停顿。但我处既没有通知各出版单位停止寄送刊物，也没有对旧存刊物及时处理，以致造成浪费现象。这是对国家资财重视不足和缺乏责任心的官僚主义作风的具体表现。同时也说明了我处在工作中还有盲目性。地方刊物指导科取消后，我处已经在十月二十四日把以上工作移交秘书处编辑科。这个科对这一工作正在进行研究处理。我处今后要加强工作中的计划性，并随时检查工作，以防止再发生类似的浪费现象。
