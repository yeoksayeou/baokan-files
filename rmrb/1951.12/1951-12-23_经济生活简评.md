    Promoting Advanced Experiences Requires Thorough Preparation

    The main experience of the Beijing construction industry in promoting the "Su Changyou bricklaying method" is to make all preparations before promotion. This experience has been repeatedly proven correct.

    Promoting advanced experiences means revolutionizing old operating methods. Old ideas, operating methods, and labor organization will all be overthrown by new experiences. Of course, this is a major event. Some enterprise leaders do not recognize the serious significance of this matter. They often arrange things sloppily, neither checking nor providing specific assistance. When problems arise, they are also at a loss. Promoting advanced experiences like this is bound to fail.

    The Beijing construction industry made thorough preparations before promoting the "Su Changyou bricklaying method." Selecting relatively mature construction sites for experimentation can protect advanced experiences and prevent them from being destroyed under particularly difficult circumstances. Conducting full ideological mobilization to make the masses thoroughly understand the significance of promoting advanced experiences, breaking down ideological obstacles, and strengthening confidence in victory is the key to the smooth promotion of advanced experiences. In addition, it is also very important for leading cadres to implement specific leadership, solve problems such as changes in labor organization caused by changes in operating methods, and remove various objective restrictions on promoting advanced experiences.

    It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to this experience and create more good experiences in practical work. When promoting advanced experiences, leading cadres
    must first deeply understand the production process.

    Leading cadres of factories and mines must deeply understand the production process in order to grasp the key problems in production and improve production. The leading cadres of the Beijing Public Transportation Company subjectively wanted to improve production and made certain efforts. For example, in order to promote advanced experiences, they held worker forums, calling on everyone to learn from advanced work experience. However, they did not truly understand production, and therefore could not understand the benefits of advanced experiences, let alone the significance of promoting these advanced work experiences for production. When those workers with conservative ideas thought that these advanced work experiences were "nothing special," they generally called on everyone to learn their "spirit." Therefore, the so-called promotion of advanced work experience ended up becoming a formality and did not play any role in practical work.

    This bureaucratic leadership method is very dangerous. Leading cadres with this shortcoming do not understand production themselves and are unwilling to go deep into production to learn. They are clueless but blindly confident, resulting in becoming conservatives. They are short-sighted, cannot see advanced things, and finally give up leadership and follow the backward masses. To correct this shortcoming, these leading cadres must go deep into production, learn honestly, and not pretend to be experts when they are not. Only in this way can they become true experts.

    经济生活简评
    推广先进经验必须进行周密的    准备工作
    北京市建筑业推广“苏长有砌砖法”的主要经验，是在推广以前，作好一切准备工作。这个经验，已经一再被证明是正确的。
    推广先进经验，这就是说，对于旧的操作方法，实行革命。旧的思想、操作方法、劳动组织，都要被新的经验推翻。当然，这是一件大事。有些企业领导干部，不认识这件事情的严重意义，他们常常是马马虎虎地布置一下，既不检查，又不具体帮助，发生了问题，自己也是束手无策。像这样推广先进经验，没有不失败的。
    北京市建筑业推广“苏长有砌砖法”，事先作了周密的准备工作。选择条件比较成熟的工地进行试验，这可以保护先进经验，使它不在特殊困难的情况下受到摧残。进行充分的思想动员，使群众彻底认识推广先进经验的意义，打破思想障碍，坚定胜利信心，这是先进经验能否顺利推广的关键。此外，领导干部实行具体领导，随时解决因为操作方法的改变而引起的劳动组织的改变等问题，去掉推广先进经验的各种客观限制，也是非常重要的。
    希望各地重视这一经验，并在实际工作中，创造更多的好经验。领导干部在推广先进经验时
    先要深入了解生产过程
    厂矿企业领导干部，必须深入了解生产过程，这样才能抓住生产中的关键问题，把生产搞好。北京市公共汽车公司的领导干部，主观上很想把生产搞好，也作了一定的努力。例如：为了推广先进经验，他们召开了工人座谈会，号召大家学习先进工作经验。但他们没有真正了解生产，因而也不能了解先进经验的好处在哪里，更不知道推广这些先进工作经验，对于生产有什么意义。当那些有保守思想的工人认为这些先进工作经验“没有什么”的时候，他们便泛泛地号召大家学习他们的“精神”。因此，所谓推广先进工作经验，结果是流于形式主义，对于实际工作并没有起什么作用。
    这种官僚主义的领导方法，是十分危险的。有这种缺点的领导干部，他们自己不懂得生产，又不肯深入到生产中去学习。他们心中无数，而又盲目自信，结果成为保守主义者。他们眼光短浅，看不见先进的事物，终于放弃领导，跟着落后的群众走。为了改正这个缺点，这些领导干部必须深入到生产中去，老老实实地学习，不要以外行充内行。只有这样，才能变成真正的内行。
