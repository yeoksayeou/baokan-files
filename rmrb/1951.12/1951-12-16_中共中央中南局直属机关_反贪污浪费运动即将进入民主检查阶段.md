Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th. The streamlining and economy committee of organs directly under the CCP Central Committee Central-South Bureau has decided to vigorously launch a mass anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign. This campaign will be carried out in the manner of rectification. The mobilization and study phase in various units has now concluded, and democratic inspection will soon begin.

From the very start of the campaign, the leadership of the organs directly under the Central-South Bureau grasped the crucial link of broad and in-depth mobilization and universal mass mobilization. On November 30th, the CCP Central Committee Central-South Bureau and the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee jointly convened a production increase and economy mobilization conference. At the meeting, Deng Zihui, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Central-South Bureau, delivered a mobilization report. Subsequently, the organs directly under the Central-South Bureau convened a general meeting of all cadres, where Zeng Yifan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central-South Bureau, conveyed Deng Zihui's mobilization report and further mobilized the cadres in light of the specific circumstances of the organs directly under the Bureau. Following these two mobilization conferences, various departments convened separate meetings, with the heads of each department conducting further mobilization. The Party Committee of the organs directly under the Central-South Bureau also separately convened meetings of Party members and Youth League cadres above the level of group leader, calling on Party members and League members to take the lead in examining their own thinking and work style, resolutely combat corruption and waste, and ensure the smooth progress of the campaign. The CCP branches and Youth League branches in various units also carried out in-depth mobilization.

After mobilization and study, the staff of various units have ideologically and theoretically recognized the significant role of the production increase and economy movement in supporting the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea and in building the country, as well as its significant meaning in closely linking the Party with the masses, improving cadre thinking, purifying the organization, and creating a good political atmosphere. When the movement had just begun, some cadres believed that corruption and waste were not serious in their departments, and there was nothing to inspect. During the mobilization and study, everyone initially conducted inspections in connection with reality, and discovered that the embezzled and stolen funds of the correspondents, civil servants, drivers, etc. of the Administrative Office of the Central-South Bureau alone amounted to more than 10 million yuan. There were also many incidents of waste. For example, after burning heating in the Administrative Office of the Central-South Bureau last year, the inspection was neglected, and the water in the radiators was not drained, causing damage to the boiler and radiators, which resulted in 50 million yuan in repair costs. As a result of checking out these facts, the cadres of various departments began to change their view that "the situation of corruption and waste is not serious." Based on the results of the inspection in the previous stage, the streamlining and economy committee of the organs directly under the Central-South Bureau has initially established improvement measures: (1) Tighten the organizational structure of the organs in accordance with regulations, and allocate surplus personnel to other jobs. The General Office of the Central-South Bureau merged offices, reducing service personnel, correspondents, and drivers. (2) Clean up the office supplies of various departments. It is estimated that for two months in the first half of next year, office supplies will not need to be collected. (3) Turn over one-third of the production profit of the organs' enterprises to the state; surplus houses shall also be handed over to the property management committee for disposal.

    中共中央中南局直属机关
    反贪污浪费运动即将进入民主检查阶段
    【新华社汉口十四日电】中共中央中南局直属机关精简节约委员会决定大张旗鼓地展开群众性的反对贪污、反对浪费运动。这次运动是以整风的方式来进行的。现在各单位的动员、学习阶段已告结束，即将开始进行民主检查。
    运动一开始，中南局直属机关领导方面即抓紧了广泛深入动员、普遍发动群众这一重要环节。十一月三十日，中共中央中南局和中南军政委员会联合召开了增产节约动员大会。会上，中共中央中南局第三书记邓子恢作了动员报告。接着，中南局直属机关召开了全体干部大会，由中南局副秘书长曾一凡传达邓子恢的动员报告，并结合直属机关的具体情况再作动员。这两次动员大会后，各部门随即分别召开会议，由各部门首长进一步进行动员。中南局直属机关党委员会并分别召集共产党和青年团的小组长以上的党员、团员干部开会，号召党员、团员带头检查自己的思想和作风，坚决与贪污浪费现象进行斗争，保证运动的顺利进行。各单位的中共支部和青年团支部也分别进行了深入的动员。
    经过动员和学习以后，各单位的工作人员都从思想上、理论上认识了增产节约运动对支持抗美援朝斗争、建设国家的重大作用，以及在密切党与人民群众的联系、提高干部思想、纯洁组织、创造良好政治风气上的重大意义。当运动刚开始时，有些干部曾认为本部门贪污浪费现象不严重，没有什么可以检查的。在动员和学习中，大家初步地联系实际进行检查，就发现单是中南局行政处的通讯员、公务员、司机等贪污、偷窃的款项即达一千多万元。浪费的事件也不少，如中南局行政处去年烧用暖气后忽视检查，没有将暖气片中的水放走，使锅炉和暖气片受到损坏，结果花了五千万元的修理费。由于检查出了这些事实，各部门干部开始改变了认为“贪污浪费情况不严重”的看法。中南局直属机关精简节约委员会根据前一阶段的检查结果，初步确立了改进办法：（一）按规定紧缩机关编制，把多余的人员分配到其他工作岗位上去。中南局办公厅合并办公，减少了勤杂人员、通讯员和司机。（二）清理各部门的办公用品，预计明年上半年有两个月可以不领办公用品。（三）把机关企业生产利润三分之一上缴给国家；多余的房屋亦一律交房产管理委员会处理。
