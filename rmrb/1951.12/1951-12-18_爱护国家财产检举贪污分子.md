Column: Brief Comments on Political and Legal Work

    The righteous act of Xue Jiandong, a member of the Communist Youth League of the People's Bank of Qingjian County, Shaanxi Province, who refused a bribe and bravely exposed Huo Wenhut's crime of corruption, protecting 16.5 billion yuan of state property from loss, is the excellent quality that the youth of New China should possess, and also the excellent quality that the cadres and all the people of New China should possess. All cadres and people in New China should carry forward this spirit of being highly responsible for state property and the people's interests, wage an irreconcilable struggle against all thieves who steal state property, and relentlessly expose their misdeeds and crimes.
    Cadres like Xue Jiandong, who bravely report corrupt elements, exist everywhere. The leading bodies in various localities should encourage such cadres and resolutely support their actions. However, in the past, some leaders adopted completely wrong attitudes towards such matters, thereby dampening the political enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. For example, in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, when a cadre reported to one of the county's responsible persons that a major corruption case had been discovered in the Sixth District, the responsible person rebuked the reporter, saying, "What did I originally tell you to investigate? Who asked you to find out about these things?" When leaders are so indifferent to state property and bureaucracy develops to such a serious extent, it is difficult for cadres and the masses to carry out reports and exposures of corrupt elements. Such lessons must never be repeated.
    We demand that leading organs and leading cadres with similar situations immediately and thoroughly change this shameful bureaucratic style and irresponsible attitude towards state property, conduct in-depth education among the broad masses of cadres and people, and fully promote their patriotic enthusiasm and political initiative, so that everyone can take a master's attitude to supervise state personnel and bravely report corrupt elements. Only in this way can all corrupt elements and thieves have nowhere to hide and the phenomenon of corruption be completely eliminated.

    爱护国家财产检举贪污分子
    陕西省清涧县人民银行青年团员薛建栋拒绝受贿，勇敢揭发霍文虎贪污罪行，保护国家财产一百六十五亿元免受损失的正义行为，是新中国青年应有的优良品质，也是新中国的干部和全体人民应有的优良品质。新中国所有的干部和群众，都应该发扬这种对国家财产和人民利益高度负责的精神，向一切偷窃国家财产的盗贼进行不调和的斗争，毫不留情地揭发他们的恶迹和罪行。
    像薛建栋这种勇敢检举贪污分子的干部，是到处都有的。对于这样的干部，各地领导机关应该加以鼓励，坚决支持他们的行动。但是过去有些领导人员对于这种事情所采取的态度，是完全错误的，因而打击了干部和群众的政治热情。例如陕西省郃阳县有一个干部向县的负责人之一报告第六区发现大贪污案时，这个负责人竟责备报告者说：“我原来叫你去调查什么的？谁要你去了解这些事情？”领导者对国家财产这样漠不关心，官僚主义发展到这样严重的程度，干部、群众对贪污分子的检举揭发是很难开展起来的。这样的教训无论如何是不能再重复的。
    我们要求有类似情形的领导机关和领导干部，立即彻底地改变这种可耻的官僚主义作风和对国家财产不负责任的态度，对广大干部、群众进行深入的教育，充分地发扬他们的爱国热情和政治积极性，让每一个人都能拿出主人翁的态度来监督国家工作人员，勇敢地检举贪污分子。只有如此，才能使一切贪污分子和盗贼无地自容，彻底消灭贪污现象。
