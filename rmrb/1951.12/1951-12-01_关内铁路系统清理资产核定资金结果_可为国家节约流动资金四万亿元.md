Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The work of inventorying current assets and verifying working capital in the inland railway system has been basically completed, and the work of collecting report forms and material allocation is now underway. According to incomplete statistics, the inland railway system, through this inventory of current assets and verification of working capital, can save and remit to the state a total of more than four trillion yuan in working capital. Among them, the Tianjin Railway Administration can save 400 billion yuan in working capital. The materials cleared out by the Zhengzhou Railway Administration are ten times more than the fixed material quantity after verification. The existing materials of the Shanghai Railway Administration also exceed five times the fixed material quantity after verification. The existing material quantities of other railway administrations also exceed the fixed quantity by several times.

This inventory of current assets and verification of working capital is of great benefit to strengthening the economic accounting thinking of railway cadres and carrying out the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. In the past, many units established small warehouses or hoarded materials, thinking that it would be inconvenient to use them after handing over all the materials; this time, everyone voluntarily handed over the concealed materials. The off-book materials cleared out by the Zhengzhou Railway Administration are worth 19.5 billion yuan. Guo Hairu, the deputy section chief of the Hengyang Vehicle Depot, originally hid many freight car parts, intending to report them as material savings when repairing cars, but this time he handed them all over. In the past, some railway factories blindly produced accessories, resulting in a serious backlog of funds. For example, the brake shoes produced by the Wuhan Jiang'an Railway Factory could be used for three years. Now this shortcoming of wasting funds has been basically corrected. The concept of workers cherishing state property has been universally strengthened. For example, when workers cut iron plates, they used to pick up a sheet of raw iron and cut it at will, but now they have learned to reasonably use materials according to the required size and style.

However, some leading cadres still do not pay enough attention to this work. For example, the factory director of the Qishuyan Railway Factory of the Shanghai Railway Administration believes that "there are so many materials that it is really not easy to thoroughly clean them up, it is enough to be roughly the same." As a result, the Qishuyan Railway Factory still has discrepancies between materials and material accounts. In the work of inventorying current assets and verifying working capital, it was also found that some units did not pay enough attention to the safekeeping of materials that had been decided to be handed over to the state. For example, the Hengyang Locomotive Depot placed the machines and some important materials handed over to the state outside the warehouse. The Hengyang Engineering Depot and the Tianjin Vehicle Factory also have similar situations. When selecting materials within the fixed quantity, the units under the Tianjin Railway Administration did not pay attention to the use of old materials, and tried to select new materials as much as possible, and handed over the old materials to the state. This bad tendency urgently needs to be corrected. In addition, some units also have a batch of materials that are easy to lose their effectiveness, such as batteries and medicines, which need to be dealt with in a timely manner, otherwise the state property will suffer losses.

### 关内铁路系统清理资产核定资金结果  可为国家节约流动资金四万亿元

    关内铁路系统清理资产核定资金结果
    可为国家节约流动资金四万亿元
    【新华社三十日讯】关内铁路系统清理流动资产和核定流动资金的工作已基本完成，现正进行汇集表报和材料调拨等工作。据不完全统计，关内铁路系统经过这次清理流动资产和核定流动资金的工作，可节约下来上缴国家的流动资金共达四万亿元以上。其中天津铁路管理局可以节省的流动资金就有四千亿元。郑州铁路管理局清出的材料比核定后的材料定量多出十倍。上海铁路管理局现有材料也超过核定后的材料定量五倍。其他各铁路管理局现有的材料数量，也超过核定量数倍。
    这次清理流动资产和核定流动资金的工作，对加强铁路干部的经济核算思想和开展爱国增产节约运动有很大好处。过去许多单位都建立小仓库或打埋伏，认为把材料都交出后，用起来不方便；这次大家都自动把隐瞒下的材料交出来。郑州铁路管理局清出的账外材料就值一百九十五亿元。衡阳车辆段副段长郭海如原来藏了许多货车零件，打算在修车时作为节约材料上报，这次全交出来。过去有些铁路工厂盲目生产配件，造成严重的积压资金现象。如武汉江岸铁路工厂生产的制动闸瓦就可以用三年。现在这种浪费资金的缺点也已基本上得到纠正。工人们爱护国家财产的观念已普遍加强。如工人剪裁铁板，过去是随便拿起一张元铁就剪，现在都学会按照需要的大小式样来合理地利用材料。
    但是还有部分领导干部对这项工作还不够重视。如上海铁路管理局戚墅堰铁路工厂的厂长认为“材料这样多，实在不容易彻底清理，大体上差不多就行了”。结果，戚墅堰铁路工厂到现在还有材料和料账不符的现象。在清理流动资产和核定流动资金工作中，也发现有些单位对已决定上缴国家的材料的保管工作不够重视。如衡阳机务段把上缴国家的机器和某些重要物资放在仓库外面。衡阳工务段、天津车辆工厂也有类似情形。天津铁路管理局所属各单位在选择定量以内的材料时，不注意利用旧料，尽量选用新料，把旧材料上缴国家。这种不良倾向亟需纠正。此外，有些单位还有一批容易失去时效的材料，如电池、医药等，需及时处理，否则将会使国家财产遭受损失。
