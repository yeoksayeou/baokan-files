    Resolutely Support Severely Punishing Corrupt Elements
    To the Editor: After reading the article "Severely Punish Corrupt Elements" by He Zhanjun and Zhang Sizhi on the first page of the People's Daily on the 9th of this month, we were quite shocked. The article stated that, according to statistics, "most of the cadres who are corrupt are new cadres (most of whom were personnel who worked in the Kuomintang reactionary government), accounting for nearly 90%." We are also retained personnel. We feel that if, after more than two years of study and self-reform, we still cannot eradicate the old ideological style left over by the Kuomintang reactionaries, it would be extremely shameful! Many veteran cadres are still living under the "supply system," which is even more difficult than our "salary system" cadres. However, the most people who commit corruption crimes are new cadres. In the face of these facts, the fallacy of "salaries are too low to maintain integrity" is self-defeating. We clearly realize that this is entirely a matter of ideological style and outlook on life, not a matter of salary level. Therefore, we are determined to actively participate in the anti-corruption movement and report corrupt elements at any time. We resolutely support severely punishing corrupt elements. And we earnestly request the People's Government to promptly formulate laws to punish corruption and waste, so as to warn and punish lawbreakers.

    坚决拥护严惩贪污分子
    编辑同志：读了本月九日人民日报第一版上贺战军、张思之所作“严厉惩办贪污分子”一文，颇为惊骇。文中说，据统计“干部贪污的以新干部居多（大部分是曾在国民党反动政府工作过的人员），占百分之九十弱”。我们也是被留用的人员。我们觉得，如果经过两年多的学习和自我改造，仍不能根除国民党反动派所遗留下来的旧思想作风，真是无比的耻辱！老干部中有很多仍在“供给制”待遇下生活，比我们“薪金制”干部尤为艰苦。但是，犯贪污罪最多的是新干部。在这些事实面前，“薪资太低，不足养廉”的谬论是不攻自破了。我们清楚地认识到，这完全是思想作风和人生观的问题，而不是薪资高低的问题。因此，我们决心积极参加反贪污运动，随时检举贪污分子。我们坚决拥护严厉惩办贪污分子。并恳切地要求人民政府从速制定惩治贪污浪费的法律，以便儆戒和惩处不法分子。
