On November 16th, the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau completed its annual transportation plan 45 days ahead of schedule. The number of loaded wagons in the first ten and a half months of this year was 54% higher than the number of loaded wagons in the same period last year. Various technical operation standards exceeded the regulations of the Tianjin Railway Administration. The entire sub-bureau completed 100% of its transportation tasks using 96.7% of its operating vehicles, saving the state a total of 27.5 billion yuan (including savings on vehicles and working capital). To respond to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and economy, all staff plan to increase production for the state by at least another 27.5 billion yuan between now and the end of the year.

In the past ten months or so, all staff of the sub-bureau carried out patriotic labor emulation drives, and they came up with many methods to improve vehicle turnover rates. For example, after implementing rush loading and unloading, the loading and unloading time at stations along the line was generally shortened by more than half compared to the original plan. In order to ensure the early completion of transportation tasks, the bureau widely promoted advanced Soviet operating methods. In September and October, 685 trains exceeded axle load, carrying more than 5,300 tons of extra cargo, saving 12.3 locomotives. The vehicle overhaul implemented a transverse operation method, gradually achieving the elimination of remaining vehicles under repair, adding 639 operating vehicles to the state in the third quarter. On the other hand, a new shunting method was promoted, greatly shortening the vehicle dwell time. The average dwell time at Zhangjiakou Station was 9.7 hours in September, and by late October it had been reduced to 6.6 hours, 36% shorter than the Tianjin Railway Administration's plan.

In addition, because the sub-bureau paid attention to strengthening vehicle dispatching, improving locomotive daily car kilometers, and forming direct trains, it achieved the goal of carrying more and running faster, thus greatly unleashing transportation potential. The transportation tasks in the third quarter increased by 22% compared with the first half of the year.

    张家口铁路分局提前完成全年任务
    为国家节省二百七十五亿元
    十一月十六日，张家口铁路分局提前四十五天完成了全年运输计划。今年十个半月的装车数量，比去年十个半月的装车数量多百分之五十四。各种技术作业标准，都超过天津铁路管理局的规定。全分局用百分之九十六点七的运用车，完成了百分之百的运输任务，一共给国家节省了二百七十五亿元（包括节省车辆与流动资金）。全体职工为了响应毛主席增产节约号召，从现在到年底，计划最少再给国家增产二百七十五亿元。
    在过去十个多月中，全分局职工进行了爱国主义劳动竞赛，他们想出许多提高车辆周转率的方法。比如装车实行抢装、抢卸以后，沿线各站的装卸时间，普遍比原计划缩短了一倍以上。为了保证提前完成运输任务，全局普遍推行了苏联的先进作业方法。在九、十两月份，有六百八十五列列车超轴，多拉五千三百多吨货物，节省了十二点三台机车。车辆检修实行横作业法，逐渐做到了消灭检修剩余车，第三季度给国家增加了六百三十九辆运用车。另一方面推行了新调车法，使车辆停留时间大大缩短，张家口站九月平均九点七小时，到十月下旬缩短到六点六小时，比天津铁路管理局计划缩短百分之三十六。
    另外，由于分局注意了加强车辆调度，提高机车日车公里，编组直达列车，达到了多拉快跑的目的，因此大大地发挥了运输潜在能力。第三季的运输任务和上半年比较，提高了百分之二十二。
