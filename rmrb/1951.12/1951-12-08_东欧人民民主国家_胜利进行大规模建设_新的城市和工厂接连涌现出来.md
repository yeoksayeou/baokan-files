    Eastern European People's Democracies
    Victoriously Carry Out Large-Scale Construction
    New Cities and Factories Emerge One After Another
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 5th] The large-scale construction work in the Eastern European People's Democracies is progressing victoriously. New cities, factories, and power stations have emerged one after another. These socialist construction projects are important symbols of the industrialization of the People's Democracies, and they movingly demonstrate the abundant vitality of the people's democratic system.

    Poland's 1951 industrial construction plan has been completed ahead of schedule. There are a total of 2,026 construction projects this year; approximately 1,500 industrial buildings have been completed, with a total ground area of 6.5 million square meters. The country's largest textile factory, the Piotrogów Cotton Mill, the steelmaking department of the Częstochowa Steel Plant, the blast furnace department of the Kościuszko Metallurgical Plant, as well as some work departments of the Warsaw Passenger Car Factory and the Lublin Truck Factory have been completed. Over two hundred large apartment buildings have been built in Poland's steel city, Nowa Huta. By the end of this year, seven hundred buildings in two hundred and fifty industrial enterprises will be completed.

    Bulgaria will have 2,400 new industrial enterprises completed this year. The Stalin Fertilizer Plant in Dimitrovgrad, the largest in the Balkans, the country's largest "Maritsa III" power plant, and the "Republic" power plant have all started operation one after another. The generating capacity of the "Republic" power plant alone exceeds the total generating capacity of Bulgaria's entire power industry before liberation. The Dimitrov Shipyard in Stalin City has been completed, replacing the original small repair shipyard. The country's largest irrigation project, the Kolarov Reservoir, was completed before the October Revolution Day and can irrigate 160,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of land in the Sremska Lowland.

    In the eastern region of Romania, hundreds of new dredgers and other machines are working intensively to build the Danube-Black Sea Canal. Thanks to the full use of technical equipment and the widespread application of advanced Soviet experience, the labor productivity of construction workers in the first half of this year has increased by 64 percent, and the degree of mechanization has increased by 286 percent. The basic construction of the Lenin Hydropower Station with a generating capacity of 210,000 kilowatts has begun. Currently under construction are the dam and reservoir projects, reinforcing the Bistrița River's riverbed, and excavating a five-kilometer-long water diversion tunnel. Upon completion of the canal and hydropower station, the backward eastern and northern regions of Romania will be completely transformed.

    In Hungary, the "Stalin" Steel Plant, one of Europe's largest steel plants, smelted its first furnace of iron on the October Revolution Day. Many construction workers in Stalin City, an industrial city located near the plant, have increased their workload to 517 percent in the competition to celebrate the October Revolution Day, in order to accelerate the construction of this city. Another huge project in progress is the Tisza River hydropower station and embankment, which will irrigate 200,000 hectares of land.

    Czechoslovakia, known for its industrialization, is also engaged in large-scale construction. The Gottwald Steel Plant being built in Ostrava is under construction, and thousands of workers from all over the country have come to participate in the construction work. The working people of Ostrava have organized work teams to complete one million hours of voluntary labor. By the beginning of next year, this large steel plant can start production. Slovakia is rapidly moving towards industrialization. Dozens of industrial enterprises built according to the Five-Year Plan include the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant, which can produce more than one million tons of steel annually, and the huge power station on the Danube River.

    Albania's three major construction projects have been completed ahead of schedule. The Stalin Textile Factory has produced its first batch of textiles, which can supply every Albanian with 20 square meters of clothing material each year. The Lenin Hydropower Station began supplying electricity in early November. The Maliq sugar refinery, which produces 10,000 tons of sugar, also recently started operation.

    东欧人民民主国家
    胜利进行大规模建设
    新的城市和工厂接连涌现出来
    【新华社五日讯】东欧人民民主国家的大规模建设工作正在胜利进行中。新的城市、工厂和电力站已接二连三地涌现出来。这些社会主义建设工程是各人民民主国家走向工业化的重要标志，它们动人地显示了人民民主制度的充沛的生命力。
    波兰一九五一年的工业建设计划已提前完成。今年的建设工程共有二千零二十六处；已经完工的工业建筑物约有一千五百所，总地面面积为六百五十万平方公尺。全国最大的纺织厂票特古夫棉织工厂、捷斯托科发炼钢厂的炼钢部、科斯久斯兹科冶金工厂的鼓风炉部门，以及华沙客车工厂和柳布里雅纳货车工厂的一些工作部门已经落成。波兰的钢铁城——诺瓦·胡塔已建造了两百多栋大公寓。到今年年底，将有二百五十个工业企业的七百所建筑物竣工。
    保加利亚今年将要落成的新工业企业有二千四百所。位于季米特洛夫城的巴尔干最大的斯大林肥料厂、全国最大的“马里查三号”电力厂和“共和国”电力厂都已先后开工。单是“共和国”电力厂的发电能力，就超过了保加利亚解放前全部电力工业的总发电能力。斯大林城的季米特洛夫造船厂已经竣工，代替了原有的小型修船厂。全国最大的灌溉工程——科拉罗夫水库已在十月革命节前夕完工，可以灌溉色拉新低地的十六万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的土地。
    在罗马尼亚的东部地区，几百架新式挖泥机和其他机器正在加紧开动，以建造多瑙河—黑海运河。由于充分使用技术装备和广泛运用苏联的先进经验，今年上半年建筑工人的劳动生产率已经提高了百分之六十四，工作机械化的程度增加了百分之二百八十六。发电能力为二十一万瓩的列宁水电站已开始进行基本建设，现在正在施工的有水坝和水库的工程，加固俾斯特里查河的河床和开凿一条长五公里的输水隧道。运河和水电站落成后，将使罗马尼亚落后的东部和北部地区的面目焕然一新。
    在匈牙利，欧洲最大钢铁厂之一的“斯大林”钢铁厂已在十月革命节炼出了第一炉铁。座落在该厂附近的工业城市斯大林城的许多建筑工人，在庆祝十月革命节竞赛中已把他们的工作量提高到百分之五百十七，以加速建筑这个城市。另一个在进行中的巨大工程是迪萨河的水电站与河堤，它们将可以灌溉二十万公顷的土地。
    以工业化闻名的捷克斯洛伐克也在大兴土木。在俄斯特拉发建造的哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂正在兴建中，成千的工人从各地赶来参加建筑工作。俄斯特拉发的劳动人民已组织了要完成一百万小时义务劳动的工作队。到明年年初，这个大钢铁厂就可以开工生产。斯洛伐克正在迅速走向工业化。按照五年计划建筑的几十个工业企业中，包括每年可生产一百多万吨钢铁的“胡科”冶金工厂，和多瑙河上的巨大电力站。
    阿尔巴尼亚的三个大建筑工程已先后提前完工。斯大林纺织厂已经生产了第一批纺织品，这个纺织厂每年可供给每一个阿尔巴尼亚人二十平方公尺的衣料。列宁水电站已在十一月上旬开始供电。产糖一万吨的马里库炼糖厂也在最近开工了。
