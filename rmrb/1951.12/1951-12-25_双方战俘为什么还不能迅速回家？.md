	Why Can't Both Sides' Prisoners of War Return Home Quickly?

	Today is "Christmas," and the New Year of 1952 is also approaching. The peace-loving people of all countries involved in the Korean War, especially the families of captured officers and soldiers on both sides, are now eagerly hoping that their loved ones will return home quickly to relieve the pain of long-term waiting and resume their peaceful lives. However, the Korean armistice negotiations, originally hoped to end on December 27, have not yet concluded discussions on the third and fourth agenda items, and it seems impossible for the negotiations to end on the 27th. Although the discussion on the fourth agenda item, "Arrangements for Prisoners of War," has been going on for half a month, it has made no progress so far. This situation prevents the prisoners of war on both sides from returning home quickly. We will discuss the entire issue of the negotiations separately, but what we want to ask now is, what is the reason why an agreement cannot be reached on the prisoner of war issue?

	The American side should bear full responsibility for the delay in the negotiations on the exchange of prisoners of war, because they are still treating the discussion of this issue as a child's play.

	When our representatives began discussing the fourth agenda item in the subcommittee on the 11th of this month, they put forward the fair and reasonable principle of promptly repatriating all prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement. Later, at the meeting on the 12th, based on the above principle, they put forward a five-point principled proposal for quickly resolving the fourth agenda item, including the principle of both sides releasing all prisoners of war, as well as specific provisions regarding the time, place, and implementing agency for the release and repatriation of prisoners of war, and stipulated that after both sides agreed to the above items, they would immediately exchange lists of all existing prisoners of war on both sides. Obviously, our five-point principled proposal is not only a fair and reasonable solution to the fourth agenda item but also the only way to enable all prisoners of war on both sides to return home early and enjoy a peaceful life. However, the U.S. side has harbored evil intentions on the prisoner of war issue from the very beginning, refused to express a clear attitude towards the principles and proposals put forward by our side for resolving the fourth agenda item, and attempted to release some captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides while detaining others during the exchange of prisoners of war between the two sides. Lieutenant Colonel Levy, one of the spokesmen for the U.S. side's United Nations Command, did not shy away from this shameless attempt by the U.S. side. In his conversation with U.S. reporters on the 11th of this month, he openly admitted: "The United Nations Command does not intend to give the Communist army a large number of manpower and is unwilling to release the prisoners of war back." This shameless attitude of the U.S. side was met with sharp questioning and stern condemnation by our representatives. At the same time, the U.S. side also proposed that the exchange of prisoner information must be carried out first, and the International Committee of the Red Cross must be invited to visit the prisoner of war camps as a prerequisite, otherwise they would refuse to discuss the fourth agenda item. This once again demonstrated the U.S. side's extremely unreasonable and unreasonable attitude in the negotiations. They are unwilling to agree to the principle of both sides releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war, which is even clearly stipulated in the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war signed by the United States. Then, what is the purpose of their insistence on exchanging all prisoner of war materials? Apart from delaying and refusing negotiations, what other explanation can there be? Obviously, the attitudes held by our side and the U.S. side in resolving the fourth agenda item are absolutely different. Our side, based on the principle of striving for an early realization of the armistice, advocates the release of all prisoners of war on both sides, while the U.S. side is plotting to detain some captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides and planning to re-launch the war. Our side is working hard to reach an agreement as soon as possible, while the U.S. side is consistently delaying and refusing negotiations.

	In order to dispel all excuses from the other side, our side proposed at the meeting on the 18th of this month that both sides exchange all prisoner of war information to speed up the negotiations, and handed over a complete and sufficient prisoner of war data to the U.S. side that afternoon, while accepting the data handed over by the other side. The prisoner of war data submitted by our side included the names of all prisoners of war on the other side held by our side and prepared to be fully repatriated and released after the signing of the armistice agreement, and listed the names, military numbers, unit numbers, ranks, and prisoner of war camps of each prisoner of war. The names of prisoners of war from various countries were also written in the languages of those countries. The complete and sufficient list of prisoners of war submitted by our side was even admitted by the U.S. Department of Defense and Ridgway's Tokyo headquarters to be "correct." However, the data submitted by the U.S. side on the same day contained nothing but so-called prisoner names spelled in English and prisoner numbers compiled by themselves. This kind of data was almost a pile of worthless waste paper for our side. What is particularly important is that the list submitted by the U.S. side is extremely incomplete in terms of the number of people. The actual number of names on the "list" submitted by the U.S. side is 1,456 fewer than the total number of prisoners of war they themselves announced at the meeting of the negotiating sub-group. According to the prisoner of war list written in English transliteration only which was transferred by the International Committee of the Red Cross, 44,259 prisoners were not in the list the U.S. had submitted on December 18th. According to the transfer material by the International Committee of the Red Cross, 34,786 prisoners out of the 40,000 people missing on the list by the U.S. were regular troops of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Our negotiating representatives have raised solemn questions with the U.S. side on the above issues at the meeting of the fourth agenda item subgroup on the 22nd, but the U.S. negotiating representatives not only failed to provide any credible explanations based on facts for our questions, but also went further and shamelessly claimed that they would detain the so-called South Korean personnel captured by our side in the list they recently submitted. These facts fully exposed the U.S. negotiating representatives' unreasonable attitude and the despicable conspiracy to detain our prisoners of war. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of China and North Korea.

	People know that there are also discrepancies between the list of prisoners of war submitted by our side and the actual number of enemy troops captured by our army. The reason for this discrepancy is that our army has been implementing a policy of releasing prisoners of war in large numbers during the war, and also because some prisoners of war escorted to prisoner of war camps either died from U.S. aircraft bombing and strafing, or died because they could not obtain the necessary medical supplies due to U.S. bombing and strafing.

	However, these reasons do not exist at all on the American side. So why is the list submitted by the U.S. side so incomplete? In addition to the U.S. side's conspiracy to detain a large number of Korean prisoners of war, we cannot but point out the facts jointly confirmed by American prisoners of war, our captured personnel, and other parties, namely, that the U.S. side has repeatedly and collectively killed our captured personnel. The reason why the U.S. side cannot submit a complete list of prisoners of war and is eager to cover up the responsibility for their barbarous atrocities of killing prisoners of war lies here. The reason why Colonel Hanley, Chief of the Military Law Office of the U.S. Eighth Army, was ordered to issue absurd statements slandering our side for killing prisoners of war not long ago was also to use the method of "the thief crying 'stop thief'" to cover up the U.S. side's crimes of killing prisoners of war.

	The letter from General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, to Generals Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai on the 21st of this month is another evidence of the U.S. side's deliberate attempt to cover up its crimes and delay the negotiations on prisoner of war repatriation. Although many released U.S. prisoners of war and U.S. prisoners of war still in prisoner of war camps (including the fourteen prisoners of war who issued a declaration on December 20) have repeatedly proven our army's humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war, and the only wish of the prisoners of war who have not yet been released is that the negotiations will succeed and both sides can repatriate all prisoners of war, Ridgway, while firmly preventing the negotiations from succeeding quickly, hypocritically claimed that he "only thought of the welfare of these people (referring to the captured personnel of the U.S. army) and the sorrow of their families." But isn't it strange that the same general who made this statement has been refusing to discuss the principles of exchanging prisoners of war with the Korean and Chinese sides? Please, how can the surprising contradiction between your words and your actions be reconciled? You say that you not only care about the welfare of your prisoners of war and their families, but your concern is simply immeasurable, because you "only think of" their welfare and sorrow, but you, the most benevolent and noble gentlemen, refuse to enter into discussions on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war in actual action. Here, anyone who understands the truth can clearly see that the American generals' so-called concern for the welfare of prisoners of war and their families is nothing but the most despicable lie. In fact, whether it is the welfare or sorrow of American prisoners of war and their families, it is the least worthy of their consideration. In fact, they are cold-blooded animals with no sympathy for human life. In fact, they "only think of" continuing the war of aggression, and "only think of" continuing to expand the war profit income of the Wall Street capitalists. Since the logic of the facts is so clear and unmistakable, then the U.S. generals can never escape the responsibility for delaying the discussion of the issue of exchanging prisoners of war.

	General Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said in their reply to Ridgway on the 24th: "For the benefit of the prisoners of war and their families on both sides, we believe that the most important thing at present is to quickly resolve the various issues in the negotiations, so that an agreement can be reached as soon as possible, so that all captured personnel remaining in the prisoner of war camps on both sides can quickly return to their hometowns after the agreement is signed and takes effect, and reunite with their long-separated and concerned relatives and resume their peaceful lives." In the discussion of the fourth agenda item, and in the discussion of other agenda items, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently expressed their infinite sympathy and concern for the captured personnel on both sides and their families, and have consistently expressed their sincere desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the U.S. side has refused to adopt the same attitude as us, which has prolonged the entire negotiations for almost half a year, and the third and fourth agenda items have been delayed for a month, and a complete agreement cannot be reached on the Korean armistice issue. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. side's cruelty and ruthlessness towards the prisoners of war and their families on both sides can never be concealed by their feigned concern.

	Everyone knows that the negotiating representatives of both sides reached an agreement on the issue of establishing a military demarcation line to establish a demilitarized zone on November 27, and both sides expressed the hope that the other items on the agenda could be agreed upon within a month. If the U.S. side, like the Korean and Chinese sides, was willing to realize the Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis, an agreement on all agenda items could have been reached within thirty days. Everyone also knows that the military reality on the Korean battlefield now is that not only is the situation of land warfare unfavorable to the U.S. side, but also the situation of air warfare is unfavorable to the U.S. side. However, the U.S. side would rather close its eyes and ignore these facts, and pretend to boast about its so-called superiority of military strength and so-called military pressure. They do not hesitate to deceive themselves in order to extort things at the negotiating table that they cannot obtain on the battlefield. They continue to make unreasonable demands to invade our territory and interfere in our internal affairs, and create endless troubles to obstruct and delay the progress of the negotiations. Because of this, the U.S. side is about to miss the thirty-day deadline. Because of this, the prisoners of war on both sides cannot be released quickly, and the long-term suffering of the families of thousands of captured personnel on both sides cannot be quickly eliminated. Because of this, the U.S. side's actions to delay the Korean armistice negotiations cannot escape the condemnation of world opinion.

### 双方战俘为什么还不能迅速回家？

    双方战俘为什么还不能迅速回家？
    今天是“圣诞节”，而一九五二年的新年也即将到来。在朝鲜作战双方各有关国家爱好和平的人民，尤其双方被俘官兵的家属，目前都急切地盼望着自己的亲人们迅速地回家，以便解除长期悬望的痛苦，恢复自己的和平生活。但是原来希望于十二月二十七日结束的朝鲜停战谈判，至今对于第三、第四两项议程的讨论还没有终结，眼看谈判是不可能在二十七日结束了。对于第四项议程即“关于俘虏的安排问题”的讨论虽然已经进行了半个月，直到现在仍然毫无进展。这种情形，就使双方战俘不能迅速回家。对于谈判的整个问题，我们将另行讨论，我们现在要问的是关于战俘问题不能得到协议的原因何在呢？
    交换俘虏的谈判所以被拖延下来，美国方面应该担负全部的责任，因为他们直到现在把这个问题的讨论当作儿戏。
    我方代表在本月十一日在第四项议程小组委员会开始商谈的时候，即提出双方在停战协议签字后迅速遣送全体战俘的公平合理的原则。以后，又于十二日的会议上根据上述的原则，提出了迅速解决第四项议程的五点原则建议，其中包括了双方释放全体战俘的原则，以及关于释放与遣送战俘的时间、地点与执行交换俘虏机构的具体规定，并且规定了在双方同意了上述各项后，即行交换双方现有全部战俘名单。显然的，我方的这五点原则建议不仅是解决第四项议程的公平合理方案，而且是使双方俘虏全部得以早日回家，享受和平生活的唯一途径。而美方则从一开始就在战俘问题上怀了丑恶的鬼胎，对我方所提的解决第四项议程的原则和建议拒绝表示明确的态度，并企图在双方交换俘虏时释放一部分朝中被俘人员而扣留另一部分。美方的联合国军司令部发言人之一的李维中校，并不讳言美方的这一无耻企图，他在本月十一日对美方记者的谈话中，就曾公开招认：“联合国军不打算给共军以很大的人力，不愿把俘虏释放回去。”美方的这种无耻态度遭到了我方代表尖锐的质问和严厉的斥责。与此同时，美方又提出必须首先交换俘虏资料，并邀请红十字国际委员会访问俘虏营为先决条件，否则拒绝讨论第四项议程。这就又表现了美方在谈判中的极端无理和蛮横态度。他们既不肯同意我方所提出的双方释放与遣送全体战俘的原则，而这一原则甚至是美国所签字的日内瓦战俘公约也明确规定了的，那末，他坚持必须交换全部战俘材料的目的何在呢？除了借此拖延与拒绝谈判之外，还能有其他什么样的别的解释呢？显然的，我方和美方在解决第四项议程上所持的态度绝对不同，这就是：我方根据争取早日实现停战的原则，主张双方释放全体战俘，而美方则阴谋扣留一部分朝中被俘人员，计划重新发动战争；我方努力尽速取得协议，而美方则一贯地拖延和拒绝谈判。
    我方为解除对方的一切藉口，于本月十八日的会议上提议双方交换全部战俘资料，以加速谈判的进行，并于当日下午以一份完整而充分的俘虏资料交给美方，同时接受了对方所交来的资料。我方所提交的俘虏资料，包括了我方所有的和准备在停战协议签字后全部遣送和释放的对方的全部俘虏名单，并开列了各该俘虏的姓名、军人号码、部队番号、级别、所在俘虏营等，各国俘虏的名字又都用各该国文字写明。我方所提交的这一份完整而充分的俘虏名单，甚至美国国防部和李奇微的东京总部也不得不承认是“正确的”。但是美方当日所交来的资料，除了英文拼写的所谓俘虏名字和他们自编的俘虏编号之外，其他竟一无所有。这种资料对于我方几乎是一堆毫无价值的废纸。尤其重要的是美方交来的名单是人数极不完全的。美方所交出的“名单”的实际姓名的数目，较他们自己在谈判小组会议上所宣布的俘虏总数，即缺少一千四百五十六名之多。美方经由红十字国际委员会交来的同样仅以英文拼音书写的战俘名单，其中竟有四万四千二百五十九人不在美方十二月十八日所交来的名单中，而根据红十字国际委员会转交的材料，美方这次名单遗漏的四万余人中，共有三万四千七百八十六人是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的正规部队人员。我方谈判代表已于二十二日的第四项议程小组会议上就上述问题向美方提出严正质问，但是美方谈判代表对于我方的质问，不但提不出任何有事实根据的可信的解释，反而更进一步，无耻地公然声称将扣留他们在最近交出的名单中的所谓南朝鲜籍的我方被俘人员。这些事实，充分地暴露了美方谈判代表的蛮横无理的态度和妄想扣留我方俘虏的卑鄙阴谋。这是朝中两国人民所绝对无法容忍的。
    人们知道，我方所交的俘虏名单和我方实际曾经俘虏的敌军人数也是有出入的，其所以有这种出入，是因为我军执行着在战争进行时就大批释放俘虏的政策，并且也因为一部分解往俘虏营的俘虏，或者遭受美国飞机的轰炸扫射而死亡，或者由于美国的轰炸扫射以致得不到必要的医药的供应而死亡。
    但是这些原因在美国方面是完全不存在的。那么为什么美方所交出的名单却是如此不完全呢？除了美方扣留大批朝鲜战俘的阴谋以外，我们不能不指出为美国俘虏、我方被俘人员和其他方面所共同证实了的事实，即美方曾多次地集体地杀害我方被俘人员。美方所以交不出一份完整的俘虏名单，并急于把他们残杀俘虏的野蛮暴行的责任掩饰过去，原因就在这里。美国第八军军法处长汉莱上校不久以前所以受命发表诬蔑我方杀害俘虏的荒谬声明，原因也就在于要用“贼喊捉贼”的办法来掩盖美方残杀俘虏的罪行。
    联合国军总司令李奇微在本月二十一日致金日成、彭德怀两将军的信是美方蓄意掩盖美方罪行和拖延遣俘谈判的另一个证据。虽然很多被释放的美方俘虏和现在还在俘虏营的美方俘虏（包括在十二月二十日发表宣言的十四名俘虏）都已经反复证明了我军对战俘的人道待遇，而现在还未获释的俘虏们唯一愿望就是谈判成功，双方可以遣回全部战俘，而李奇微却在坚决不让谈判迅速成功的时候，极端虚伪地声称“一心只想到这些人（指美方军队的被俘人员）的福利和他们的家庭的哀痛”。但是作这个声明的同一个将军却一直拒绝与朝中方面讨论交换战俘的原则，这岂不是太奇怪的事吗？请问：你们的言论与你们的行动之间的出奇的矛盾怎样能够调和起来呢？你们说，你们不但关心你们的战俘和他们的家庭的福利，而且你们的关心简直是无以复加了，因为你们“一心只想到”他们的福利和哀痛，但是你们，最仁慈的最高贵的先生们在实际的行动上却拒绝进入交换俘虏问题的讨论。在这里，任何明白事理的人都可以清楚地看到：美国的将军们所谓关心战俘及其家庭的福利云云，不过是最卑鄙的谎言，实际上，不管是美国俘虏及其家属的福利也好，或者哀痛也好，对于他们都是最不值得一顾的，实际上他们乃是对于人类生命没有丝毫同情心的冷血动物，实际上他们“一心只想到”要继续进行侵略战争，“一心只想到”要继续扩大华尔街大资本家们的战争利润收入。事实的逻辑既然是这样明白无疑，那末，美方将军们就绝对不能逃避他们拖延交换战俘问题的讨论的责任。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在二十四日给李奇微的复信里说：“为了双方战俘和他们家属的利益，我们认为，当前最重要的事情，是迅速解决谈判中的各项问题，使之早日达成协议，以便使停留在双方战俘营中的全部被俘人员，得以在协定签字生效后，迅速回到他们的家乡去，和他们久别而悬念的亲人们团聚，恢复他们的和平生活。”朝中方面在第四项议程的讨论中，和在其他各项议程的讨论中都一贯表示了自己对于双方被俘人员和他们的家属的无限同情和关怀，一贯表示了自己的和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚愿望。但是美国方面却拒绝采取和我们同样的态度，这就使整个谈判延长到几乎半年之久，第三项和第四项议程拖延了一个月，还不能就朝鲜停战问题达成全部的协议。由此可见，美国方面对双方战俘及其家属的残酷无情，决不是他们的假装关心所能够掩饰得了的。
    大家都知道：双方谈判代表在十一月二十七日已达成关于确立停战军事分界线以建立非军事区问题的协议，双方并曾表示希望议程上的其他项目能在一个月内达成协议。如果美国方面也和朝中方面一样，愿意在公平合理的基础上实现朝鲜停战，全部议程的协议本来是完全能够在三十天之内达成的。大家也知道：现在朝鲜战场的军事现实，不但陆军作战的情况对于美方不利，而且空军作战的情况也对美方不利。但是美国方面却宁愿闭眼不看这些事实，装腔作势地吹嘘自己的所谓军事力量的优势和所谓军事压力。他们不惜自欺欺人，以图在谈判会议桌上勒索到他们在战场上所无法取得的东西。他们继续不断地提出侵占我方土地、干涉我方内政的无理要求，并层出不穷地横生枝节，以阻挠和拖延谈判的进行。就因为这样，美方眼看就要把三十天的期限错过去了。就因为这样，双方战俘无从迅速获得释放，双方万千被俘人员家属的长期悬望的痛苦，也因此不能迅速加以消除。就因为这样，美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判的行为，决不能逃避世界舆论的谴责。
