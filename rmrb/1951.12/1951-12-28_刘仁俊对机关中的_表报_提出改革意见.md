    Liu Renjun proposes reforms to "forms and reports" in government offices

    Editor: As a "forms and reports" worker in a government office, I would like to offer some suggestions on opposing bureaucracy in today's anti-bureaucracy movement.

    I often see "forms and reports" that are compiled from several or even dozens of forms. These forms generally have printed items such as Manager, Deputy Manager, Director, Section Chief, Unit Chief, Review, and Compiler. One form from a certain office had 765 stamps on it. Some have fewer, around three or four hundred. Some leaders haven't even seen the form, but their stamps are still affixed. Some forms aren't even looked at by the section chief, but the stamp still has to be affixed. The time spent affixing stamps is astonishing. I once spent fifteen minutes affixing nearly one hundred stamps to a "form and report." Sometimes, most of the procedures for a "form and report" are completed, but the time is delayed and wasted because the "system" of affixing stamps hasn't been completed. In this way, stamping becomes a formality, wasting manpower and resources, and even delaying matters. This is red tape, which is also bureaucracy. It should be reformed quickly. I have three suggestions: First, implement a responsibility system and truly achieve "responsibility through stamping." If a section chief can be responsible for a form and report, only the stamps of the Section Chief, Reviewer, and Compiler should be affixed. Second, if each form and report has only five pages, all five pages can be stamped the same way. If each form and report has more than five pages, then only the "Compiler" and the first page of the rest should be stamped in the same way. To guard against illegal elements, a certain stamp should be added to the waist of each form. Third, if the "forms and reports" are indeed issued after being reviewed by the Manager, Director, etc., then the stamps of the Manager, Director, etc., should be affixed.

    These are all immature opinions. I very much hope that relevant departments will promulgate a set of rules regarding the stamping of "forms and reports," just as the Central Publishing Administration promulgated the usage of punctuation marks.    Liu Renjun

    刘仁俊对机关中的“表报”提出改革意见
    编辑同志：我是一个机关中的“表报”工作人员。在反对官僚主义运动的今天，我对反对文牍主义提一些意见。
    我常常看到一些“表报”，是由几张甚至几十张表汇集起来的。在这些表上，一般都印着经理、副理、处长、科长、股长、复核、制表等项。某机关有一份表，上面盖着七百六十五个图章。有少一些的，盖着三、四百个图章。有的首长，没有见到那份表，但都盖有他的图章。有的表，连科长也不看，但图章也要照盖。为盖图章花去的时间，是惊人的。我盖过一份有近一百个图章的“表报”，就花了十五分钟。有时，一份“表报”，绝大部分的手续都完毕了，就是还有盖章这个“制度”没有作完，就拖延、耽误了时间，像这样，盖章成了形式，浪费了人力、物力，还误了事。这是文牍主义，也就是官僚主义。应该迅速改革。我有三点建议：一、实行负责制，真做到“盖章负责”。一份表报，如果科长可以负责，只盖科长、复核、制表三个图章。二、如果每份表报里只有五张，可以五张同样盖章。如果每份表报在五张以上，那就只在“制表”上和其余的第一张上照样盖章。为了提防不法分子，在每份表的腰上加盖一定的图章。三、如果“表报”确实是经理、处长等批阅后发的，那就再盖上经理、处长等的图章。
    这些都是不成熟的意见。我很盼望有关部门像中央出版总署颁布标点符号用法一样，也颁布一套有关“表报”盖章的制度。    刘仁俊
