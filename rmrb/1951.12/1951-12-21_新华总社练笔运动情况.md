　　Xinhua News Agency Head Office's Writing Practice Campaign
       Yang Yi
    The purpose of the Xinhua News Agency Head Office's editorial department in launching the writing practice campaign is to improve the professional skills of its staff in a planned and organized manner. This means that in addition to constantly paying attention to grasping policies, promoting policies, and strengthening the ideological content of reports in daily interviewing and writing, a mass-based professional learning campaign is launched throughout the editorial department. This campaign starts with the most basic professional skills and gradually improves them, aiming to achieve familiarity and proficiency in all aspects of the business. The specific requirement for the first stage of the writing practice campaign is to overcome the serious shortcomings of carelessness and frequent corrections in current editorial work, and to reduce and gradually eliminate technical errors, factual errors, and grammatical errors in news稿件.
    The first task in launching the writing practice campaign is to conduct in-depth ideological mobilization through administrative, Party, and Youth League meetings of all sizes, as well as wall newspapers and publications, so that every staff member of the editorial department can consciously, actively, and modestly participate in this learning campaign. During the mobilization, special attention is paid to breaking down ideas of arrogance, complacency, lack of confidence, and contempt for professional skills. The significance and importance of the writing practice campaign are repeatedly explained to everyone, emphasizing that news work is a specialized field of knowledge, and mastering this field requires hard work. It is pointed out that we lack the most basic rigorous training in news writing, and therefore should attach great importance to professional skills and be determined to learn from scratch. It is emphasized that as long as we work hard, we will definitely gain something.
    After everyone has a correct understanding of the writing practice campaign, it is then necessary to do a good job in the leadership, organization, and inspection of the campaign. To this end, we have carried out the following work:
    (1) The General Editorial Office stipulates that the writing practice campaign is the central task of the editorial department and serves as one of the main topics of reporting meetings, editorial meetings, and business meetings of various departments. The General Editorial Office appoints a dedicated person to be responsible for guiding and resolving daily problems in the campaign and instructs the heads of various departments to personally lead, supervise, inspect, and promote the development of the campaign in their respective departments, and to introduce advanced experiences and good methods at any time to promote the development of the entire campaign. The General Editorial Office and various departments have designated dedicated personnel to be specifically responsible for the inspection, registration, and statistics of errors.
    (2) Formulate specific goals and progress for the entire editorial department and various departments to eliminate errors, requiring an 80% reduction in the error rate within three months compared to the month before the start of the campaign.
    (3) Do a good job in inspection, registration, and statistical work: Establish a series of rigorous, accurate, but simple and easy-to-implement inspection, registration, and statistical procedures. Print "Technical Error Registration Forms" and "Finished Product Error Statistics Forms." Adopt self-inspection and layer-by-layer inspection methods, carefully register daily, and compile statistics weekly. This is used as a regular and strict working system.
    (4) Organize competitions and awards: First, the Party and the Youth League mobilize competition between groups and individuals. The results of error checks are announced weekly, and the performance of the entire editorial department, various departments, and individuals is calculated according to certain standards. Groups with fewer errors are awarded red flags, and groups with more errors are awarded black flags. Monthly summaries are made, and the best performing groups and individuals receive material rewards. At the same time, daily telegram inspections and weekly reporting reviews also focus on the writing practice campaign as one of the main contents, and praise and criticize errors found.
    (5) Study grammar: Purchase some grammar books and distribute them to various departments for everyone to read. Invite experts to give reports on grammar at the agency, organize everyone to attend reports on grammar issues at other organizations, and have the Deputy Editor-in-Chief explain some existing grammar problems in the稿件 to everyone.
    (6) Strengthen the data verification system: Before the 稿件 is sent out, it is submitted to the Data Section for verification of facts and provision of opinions. To ensure the success of this work, the Data Section is instructed to make investigation and statistics, and the collection of first-hand authoritative data, their current central task.
    The first three months of the editorial department's writing practice campaign have been fruitful. This is reflected in the improvement of稿件 quality, the gradual reduction of technical errors, factual errors, and grammatical errors, and the reduction of the number of corrections from two or three times every two days before the start of the campaign to once every two days. The finished product error rate of various departments averaged 0.037% in the first month, and fell to 0.02% in the following two months. Some groups have achieved one week without any finished product errors. The writing is also smoother than in the past and generally conforms to grammar. The work attitude and style of cadres have also improved. Everyone is more serious and careful in handling稿件, checking facts, deliberating on the wording, and paying attention to grammar than before. Everyone also realizes that technical errors can be completely reduced and gradually eliminated. In addition, everyone has also explored some rules for correcting errors and can formulate specific correction methods based on their own errors.
    Based on the results of the first stage of the writing practice campaign, we have the following understandings:
    (1) The writing practice campaign is a mass movement, and repeated ideological mobilization must first be carried out to form a consensus on understanding and to fully mobilize the consciousness, enthusiasm, creativity, and perseverance of cadres.
    (2) The leadership of the campaign must be strong, constant, and specific. The General Editorial Office must appoint a dedicated person to be responsible, with certain assistants, and must obtain the cooperation of the Party, the Youth League, and the assistance of various departments. Only in this way can the campaign be sustained, and the content of the campaign can be gradually improved and enriched with the development of the campaign.
    (3) A simple, easy-to-implement, yet rigorous and accurate inspection, registration, statistics, and summary system must be established. Daily inspections and registrations; weekly statistics and announcements; monthly summaries (or mini-summaries) and awards. Only in this way can the development of the campaign be grasped, making it easier to stipulate the direction of efforts and specific progress and goals, maintain a warm and compact atmosphere, and advance the campaign.
    After the first stage of the writing practice campaign was carried out for three months, the Head Office then began a political study of loyalty and honesty, and political awareness. Because the writing practice campaign had not yet taken root in the minds of cadres, and everyone underestimated the serious political significance of eliminating errors, the writing practice campaign was virtually suspended during the study period, and errors in the稿件 gradually increased again. After the study, the leadership did not promptly grasp and supervise, and the original systems and regulations were greatly relaxed, so the error situation became more serious. Looking at the correction item alone, there were 42 times in July, 46 times in August, 48 times in September, and as many as 18 times in the nine days from October 1st to 9th.
    In response to this situation, the General Editorial Office took the following measures in mid-October to strengthen the writing practice campaign:
    (1) Strengthen the leadership of the campaign. The administration, the Party, and the Youth League jointly established a "Writing Practice Campaign Committee," under the leadership of the Editor-in-Chief, responsible for the planning, promotion, research, and awards of the writing practice campaign.
    (2) Re-conduct in-depth ideological mobilization. The General Editorial Office compiled and announced the recent situation of the writing practice campaign, error statistics, and typical error examples, and mobilized various departments and every staff member of the editorial department to conduct in-depth discussions based on this, check the errors they had committed in their professional work during this period, analyze the situation, study the causes, and formulate specific and effective improvement methods.
    (3) Conscientiously restore the various systems of the writing practice campaign. Insist on implementing the original regulations for registration, inspection, and statistics, and restore those that have been interrupted immediately. Improve the Data Section's verification work and solve some of the main problems that currently exist, such as adopting pre-verification methods and establishing authoritative data. Strictly implement the reward and punishment system, and decide to conduct monthly evaluations and quarterly awards. Continue to study grammar.
    (4) Publish the "Daily News Inspection" to expose errors in a timely manner, study the causes of errors and the methods of correction, and exchange experiences, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and promote the rationalization proposal movement.
    After carrying out the above work, the writing practice campaign has begun to improve. From September 30th to November 3rd, the finished product errors of the entire editorial department were 0.058% in the first week, 0.042% in the second week, 0.033% in the third week, 0.014% in the fourth week, and even lower to 0.01% in the fifth week. This shows that although eliminating errors is an arduous task, it is entirely possible to complete this task successfully with good efforts.
    Recently, we convened a general meeting of cadres of the entire editorial department to solemnly announce the results of the evaluation of the writing practice campaign in the second half of October, and awarded red flags to the units and individuals with the best results. At the meeting, the person in charge of the General Editorial Office pointed out that the writing practice campaign is one of our patriotic production competitions and one of our increase production and conservation competitions. It was also pointed out that the writing practice campaign is a movement to eliminate accidents, reduce waste products and substandard products, and improve quality and technology. And called on everyone to actively participate in this patriotic competition and launch a new record movement to create the elimination of errors and improve quality!
    In the future, we will continue to conduct regular agitation, strengthen the daily leadership of the campaign, and further improve the inspection, verification, reward, and punishment systems. Under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the News Administration, and the Preparatory Committee of the News Publication and Printing Trade Union, we will mobilize all staff members of the editorial department to strive for error-free news reports!

### 新华总社练笔运动情况

　　新华总社练笔运动情况
       杨翊
    新华通讯社总社编辑部开展练笔运动的目的，在于有计划、有组织地提高工作人员的业务水平。这就是除了在日常采访写作中经常注意掌握政策、宣传政策、加强报道的思想性以外，并在全编辑部展开一个群众性的业务学习运动，先从最起码的业务学起，逐步提高，达到熟悉和精通全盘业务。练笔运动第一阶段的具体要求，就是克服目前编辑工作中粗心大意、更正频繁的严重缺点，减少并逐步消灭新闻稿件中的技术错误、事实错误和语法错误。
    开展练笔运动的第一个工作，是通过行政、党、团的大小会议及墙报、刊物，进行深入的思想动员，使编辑部每一工作人员都能自觉地、积极地、虚心地参加这个学习运动。动员中特别注意打破骄傲自满、信心不高和轻视业务技术的思想，向大家反复说明练笔运动的意义和重要性，说明新闻工作是一种专门学问，要掌握这门学问，必须下一番苦功夫，而我们在新闻写作上，恰好缺少最基本的严格锻炼，因之应该十分重视业务技术，痛下决心，从头学起，只要下苦功夫，一定会有收获。
    在使大家对练笔运动有了正确认识后，接着就必须做好运动的领导、组织和检查工作，为此，我们进行了下述工作：
    （一）由总编室规定练笔运动是编辑部当前的中心任务，作为汇报会、编辑会议和各部门业务会议的主要内容之一。总编室指定专人负责指导和解决运动中的日常问题，并责成各部门负责人亲自领导、督促、检查、推动本部门运动的展开，随时介绍先进经验、优良方法，推动整个运动的开展。总编室和各部门都指定专人具体负责对错误的检查、登记和统计。
    （二）制订全编辑部和各部门消灭错误的具体目标和进程，要求在三个月内减少运动开始前一个月的错误率的百分之八十。
    （三）做好检查登记和统计工作：订出一系列严密精确但又简便易行的检查、登记和统计手续，印制《技术错误登记表》和《成品错误统计表》，采用自我检查和层层检查的方法，认真地逐日登记，按周统计，以此作为一种经常的、严格的工作制度。
    （四）组织竞赛和奖评：首先由党和团来发动组和组、个人和个人之间的竞赛。对错误的检查结果按周公布，按一定标准计算全编辑部、各部门和各个人的成绩，错误少的插红旗，错误多的插黑旗。按月作出小结，成绩最好的团体和个人，可以得到物质奖励。同时，每日电讯检查及每周报道述评，也以练笔运动作为主要内容之一，针对发现的错误，进行表扬和批评。
    （五）学习语法：选购一些语法书，分发各部门，供大家阅读，邀请专家来社报告语法，组织大家去其他机关听有关语法问题的报告，并由副总编辑向大家讲解稿件中语法上现存的一些问题。
    （六）加强资料核对制度：稿件发出前交由资科室核对事实，提供意见。为保证做好这一工作，责成资料室把做好调查统计，搜集第一手权威资料，当作当前中心任务。
    编辑部练笔运动第一阶段的三个月是有收获的。这表现在稿件质量提高，技术错误、事实错误和语法错误逐步减少，更正数量由运动开始前的两天三次减到两天一次。各部门的成品错误率，第一个月平均为万分之三·七，后两个月都降到了万分之二，有的组已做到一周不出现成品错误。文字也较过去通顺，一般能合乎语法。干部工作态度和作风也有改进。大家都较前认真细心地处理稿件，查对实事，推敲文字，重视语法。大家也都认识到技术错误是完全可以减少并逐步消灭的。此外，大家还摸索出一些纠正错误的规律，能够根据自己的错误订出具体纠正的办法。
    练笔运动第一阶段推行的结果，我们有以下几点认识：
    （一）练笔运动是一个群众运动，必须首先进行反复的思想动员，以形成认识上的一致，高度发挥干部的自觉性、积极性、创造性和坚持性。
    （二）运动的领导必须是强有力的，经常的，具体的。总编室要推定专人负责，并有一定的助手，要取得党、团的配合和各部门的协助。只有这样，才能使运动坚持下去，并随着运动的发展，逐步提高和充实运动的内容。
    （三）要制订一套简便易行而严密精确的检查、登记、统计、总结制度。逐日检查、登记；按周统计、公布；每月总结（或小结）、评奖。只有这样，才可以掌握运动发展情况，便于规定努力方向和具体进程、目标，保持热烈、紧凑气氛，将运动推向前进。
    当练笔运动第一阶段进行了三个月后，总社接着开始了忠诚老实政治自觉学习。由于练笔运动还未能在干部思想中生根，大家对消灭错误的严重政治意义还估计不足，练笔运动在学习期间就无形停顿下来，稿件中的错误又日渐增加。学习结束后，领导方面又没有及时抓紧督促，原有的制度、规定大为松弛，因此错误情况更趋严重。仅就更正一项来看，七月份为四十二次，八月份上升至四十六次，九月份再上升至四十八次，而到十月一日至九日的九天中竟多至十八次。
    针对这种情况，总编室在十月中旬采取了下列一些办法来加强练笔运动：
    （一）加强运动的领导。由行政、党、团联合成立“练笔运动委员会”，在总编辑领导下，负责练笔运动的计划、推动、研究、奖评。
    （二）重新深入地进行思想动员。由总编室整理并公布了最近练笔运动的情况、错误统计和典型错误事例，发动编辑部各部门和每一工作人员据此深入讨论，检查这一期间自己在业务工作中所犯的错误，分析情况，研究原因，制订具体有效的改进办法。
    （三）认真恢复练笔运动的各项制度。坚持执行原有登记、检查、统计的规定，业已中断的，即刻恢复。改进资料室核对工作，解决目前存在的一些主要问题，如采用事前核对办法，建立权威资料等。严格执行奖惩制度，决定每月一评，三月一奖。继续学习语法。
    （四）出版《每日新闻检查》，及时揭露错误，研究错误产生的原因和纠正的办法，并交流经验，开展批评和自我批评，推动合理化建议运动。
    在进行了上述工作后，练笔运动已开始好转。自九月三十日至十一月三日的全编辑部成品错误，第一周为十万分之五点八，第二周为十万分之四点二，第三周为十万分之三点三，第四周降为十万分之一点四，第五周更降为十万分之一。这说明消灭错误虽是一个艰巨的任务，但只要经过很好的努力，这一任务还是完全可能胜利完成的。
    最近我们召开了全编辑部干部大会，隆重宣布十月下半月练笔运动成绩评定结果，发给成绩最优秀的单位和个人以红旗。会上，总编室负责同志指出练笔运动是我们爱国主义生产竞赛之一，也是我们增产节约竞赛之一；指出练笔运动是一个消灭事故，减少废品、次货，提高质量，提高技术的运动；并号召大家积极参加这一爱国竞赛，开展创造消灭错误、提高质量的新纪录运动！
    今后我们还准备继续进行经常的鼓动，加强运动的日常领导，进一步健全检查、核对、奖惩等项制度；在中共中央宣传部、新闻总署和新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会领导下，动员全编辑部工作人员，为没有错误的新闻报道而奋斗！
