Jilin Province's Special-Class Model Military Family Member Liu Qingshan
Plans to Increase Production and Save Eight Tons of Grain Next Year

    Liu Qingshan, from Xiaohuopenggou Village, Liangjiazi Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, is a glorious Communist Party member and a special-class model military family member in Jilin Province, having sent three sons to join the army. At the end of November, in response to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice strict economy, he held two evenings of family democratic meetings with his family and formulated a one-year plan for increasing production and saving, starting from December 1st of this year to December 1st of next year: 1. In terms of increasing production: On eleven *mu* (Northeast *mu*, each *mu* equals 1.5 municipal *mu*, same below) of cornfields on flat ground, based on this year's harvest of 7,500 *jin*, he plans to increase production by 2,500 *jin*; the three *mu* and two *fen* of low-lying land were flooded this year, yielding no grain, but next year he plans to produce 1,800 *jin* of soybeans; in addition, he plans to reclaim five *mu* of cultivated wasteland for planting soybeans, with a planned yield of 2,000 *jin*; in total, he aims to increase production by 6,300 *jin*. The main methods for increasing production are: applying 65 carts of manure per *qing* (hectare), 25 carts more than last year; using new farm tools for more shoveling and harrowing; timely sowing, and planting all high-quality varieties, using a hybrid of "Little Golden Yellow" and "Ma Yazi" corn varieties; and digging a 100-meter-long, one-meter-wide ditch along the edge of the field to prevent natural disasters such as drought and flood. In terms of sideline production, he plans to raise two fat pigs (the income from selling the pigs can be converted to 5,000 *jin* of sorghum). 2. In terms of savings: mainly avoiding waste in daily life. He plans to save three *jin* of soybean oil per month (previously using six *jin* per month), and save 20 *jin* of grain by avoiding waste in cooking, plus save 30 bundles of firewood, five *chi* of cloth, and ten eggs. During the New Year and festivals, even more eating and drinking expenses can be saved. In total, he can save 1,900,900 yuan throughout the year, which is equivalent to 5,400 *jin* of sorghum. Adding the two items of increasing production and saving together, it is 16,700 *jin* of grain, equivalent to more than eight tons. After the plan was made, Liu Qingshan and his family of three have already written a letter to Chairman Mao expressing their determination to realize the plan. The masses in this village are now learning from his example and formulating plans for increasing production and saving. Liu Chuan Yong

    吉林省特等军属模范刘青山
    计划明年增产节约八吨粮食
    吉林省蛟河县两家子村小伙棚沟屯的刘青山，是连送三个儿子去参军的吉林省特等军属模范，还是光荣的共产党员。十一月底，他响应毛主席增加生产、厉行节约的号召，和全家开了两晚的家庭民主会议，订出了从今年十二月一日开始到明年十二月一日止的一年增产节约计划：一、增产方面：十一亩（东北亩，每亩合市亩一亩半，下同。）平地的苞米，在今年收七千五百斤的基础上要增产二千五百斤；三亩二分洼地，今年被水冲了，一粒粮也没收，明年计划生产大豆一千八百斤；另外准备开五亩熟荒地种大豆，计划产二千斤；合起来共要增加产量六千三百斤。增产的办法主要是：每垧地上粪六十五车，比去年多上二十五车；使用新农具多铲多趟；及时下种，全种优良品种，苞米用“小金黄”“马牙子”两样品种杂交；并要在地边上挖一百米长一米宽的水沟，防止旱涝等自然灾害。在副业生产上计划养两口肥猪（卖猪的收入可折高粱五千斤）。二、节约方面：主要在日常生活上不浪费。他计划每月可省三斤豆油（过去每月用六斤），做饭不浪费可省二十斤粮食，另外节约三十捆柴、五尺布、十个鸡蛋。在过年过节时，更可节约下不少吃喝化费。总起来全年可节约一百九十万零九千元，折成高粱是五千四百斤。增产节约两项加在一起是一万六千七百斤粮食，合八吨多。计划做出后，刘青山一家老小三口人已经写信向毛主席表示了保证实现计划的决心。这屯里群众现在正纷纷学习他的榜样制订增产节约计划。　刘传永
