Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. After thoroughly inspecting various instances of waste, all units affiliated with the Northeast People's Government have generally formulated plans for institutional economy, projecting to save the nation wealth equivalent to 5,000 tons of grain from November of this year to March of next year.

The waste that existed in the past within the various units of the Northeast People's Government began to be exposed after the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-degeneration, and anti-bureaucracy movement in early September, but it did not initially attract the attention of the majority of staff. On October 26, Gao Gang, secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report at the Northeast First-Level Party Cadre Conference entitled "Comprehensively Launch the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and Further Deepen the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy," emphasizing the enormous losses caused to the country by various wasteful phenomena. He called on all organs and organizations to continue to launch a mass movement against extravagance and waste. The various units of the Northeast People's Government actively responded to this call from Gao Gang and launched an in-depth anti-waste struggle. From leading cadres to janitorial staff, everyone inspected and exposed various instances of waste according to their scope of work, from financial expenditures, warehouse management, daily work, and life, and criticized various erroneous ideas. For example, some organs used to emphasize "paying attention to appearances" because they often had foreign guests visiting, wanting to build flower cellars, paint houses, buy sofas and carpets, and buy good cars. According to statistics from the Bureau of Government Affairs Administration, the number of cars purchased from September of last year to August of this year exceeded the established quota by forty-two vehicles, and the gasoline used by vehicles within the quota also generally exceeded the original standard, but everyone thought these "did not count as waste." They did not realize that what organs serving the people should show others are policies, work style, and the achievements of various construction projects, rather than a set of formalities. This year, some units requested to build houses, and two buildings newly built by the General Office were not yet completed; everyone believed that without adding these two houses, the original houses would be sufficient. Some enterprise organs used to emphasize that their expenditures were large and that the budget was insufficient, so they arbitrarily used enterprise profits without authorization, without realizing that enterprise profits belong to the state, and organs and individuals should not arbitrarily use them.

After more than a month of inspection and criticism, and after correcting the phenomenon of waste, the Party Committee of the Northeast People's Government organs immediately launched various units to formulate economy plans based on actual conditions. Now all units have formulated plans and have largely succeeded in fully mobilizing the masses to come up with solutions. Some organs first formulated individual plans from the bottom up, and then put forward the unit's plan; some organs first put forward the requirements and goals of streamlining and economy based on the actual situation on the leadership side, submitted them to the masses for discussion, revision, and supplementation, and then launched everyone to formulate individual plans separately.

The specific contents of the plans of various organs mostly include streamlining janitorial staff, saving gasoline, houses, coal, water, electricity, newspapers, stationery, and other miscellaneous expenses. The various organs are expected to save wealth equivalent to 5,000 tons of grain for the country from November of this year to March of next year. Among them, heating coal and boiler operators alone can save 1.5 billion yuan.

With the deepening of the streamlining and economy movement, the various organs will gradually shift from saving wealth to improving institutions and various systems in order to improve work efficiency.

    东北人民政府所属各机关在深入检查各种浪费后
    普遍制订机关节约计划
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北人民政府所属各单位，在深入检查各种浪费现象后，已普遍制订了节约计划，预定从今年十一月到明年三月止，要为国家节省价值等于五千吨粮食的财富。
    东北人民政府各单位过去所存在的浪费现象，在九月初开展反贪污蜕化、反官僚主义运动后，就开始暴露出来，但当时还未引起广大工作人员的注意。十月二十六日，中共中央东北局书记高岗在东北一级党员干部会议上作了“全面开展增产节约运动，进一步深入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争”的报告，强调指出各种浪费现象给国家造成的巨大损失；号召一切机关和团体，必须继续开展一个群众性的反对铺张浪费的运动。东北人民政府各单位积极响应了高岗的这一号召，深入地展开了反浪费斗争。从领导干部到勤杂人员，都按照自己的工作范围，从财政开支、仓库保管、日常工作和生活各方面检查和揭发了各种浪费现象，并批判了各种错误思想。如有些机关因为常有外宾来往，过去曾强调要“讲究”，要修花窖，粉刷房子，买沙发地毯，买好汽车。据机关事务管理局的统计，从去年九月到今年八月，买进的汽车即超过应有编制四十二辆，编制以内的车子，所使用的汽油也普遍超过原订标准，但大家认为这些“不算浪费”；没有认识到：为人民办事的机关，要给别人看的是政策、工作作风、各种建设的成绩，而不是一套形式。今年有些单位曾要求修建房屋，由办公厅负责新建的两幢房子，到现在还没有完工；大家认为不增加这两所房子，原来的房子也够住了。有些企业机关过去强调自己的开支大，按预算就不够，因此擅自动用企业利润，而没有认识到：企业利润是国家的，机关和个人根本不应擅自动用。
    经过这一个多月的检查、批评，纠正了浪费现象以后，中共东北人民政府机关党委员会即发动各单位根据实际情况制订节约计划。现各单位都已订出计划，并大都做到了充分发动群众，大家想办法。有的机关由下而上地先订个人计划，再提出单位的计划；有的机关先由领导方面根据实际情况提出精简节约的要求和目标，交由群众讨论、修改和补充，再发动大家另订个人计划。
    各机关计划的具体内容大都包括精简勤杂人员，节约汽油、房子、煤、水、电、书报、文具及其他杂支等。各机关预定从今年十一月起到明年三月止，共为国家节省价值等于五千吨粮食的财富。其中仅取暖煤和锅炉夫两项即可节省十五亿元。
    随着精简节约运动的深入开展，各机关将逐步由节省财富转向改进机构和各种制度，以提高工作效率。
