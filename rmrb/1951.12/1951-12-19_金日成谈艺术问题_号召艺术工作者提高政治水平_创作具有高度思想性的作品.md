Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 17th. Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea met with the Korean art delegation that attended the Third World Youth and Students Peace Festival and visited the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries on the 12th, and delivered a speech on Korean art issues. Premier Kim Il-sung first praised the Korean actors for their contributions to strengthening the friendship between the Korean people and the people of other countries through their performances abroad. He pointed out: The warm welcome our actors received in distant foreign countries demonstrates the great sympathy of the world democratic camp for the fighting Korean people and the growing international prestige of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Premier Kim Il-sung said: Our literary and artistic endeavors have achieved considerable success under conditions of free development. Since liberation, our musical, dramatic, dance, and other artistic activities have been widely popularized among the masses, producing art that expresses the rich talents of the people and is excavated from the masses. However, in order to raise our literary and artistic endeavors to a higher level, much effort is still required. Artists must firmly remember and understand the principle that our art can only develop fruitfully when it becomes art with national form and democratic content, promotes internationalism, opposes formalism, and possesses profound ideological content.

Premier Kim Il-sung then said: Composers, playwrights, musicians, dancers, and actors must experience the lives of the people more and must widely utilize national classical works and folk songs created by the people that reflect the emotions and demands of the people in their creative work. However, old art must be critically absorbed from the perspective of new, modern art. Our art can only fulfill its mission fruitfully when it can correctly reflect the real situation of our people and their heroic struggles, and when it does not make the people regress but encourages them to move forward for a happy future.

Our art should reflect the national characteristics of our people, but it cannot fall into a narrow national scope. Our art should praise the friendship between peoples and promote the internationalist feelings of our people. In order to develop national art, it is necessary to study the advanced art of the Soviet Union and the art of the people of our friendly countries. Absorbing the excellent achievements of others on our national foundation will promote the development of our art and strengthen the friendly relations between us and the people of other countries.

In the path of developing art, the most serious obstacle is formalism. Formalism separates form and content, subordinates content to form, and reduces the ideological nature, popular nature, and expression of art. We must fight against it.

Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out: In order to adapt to the requirements before us, our artists must constantly pay attention to improving their political level. Those who do not understand the evolving reality, who do not understand what our people are doing and where they are going, cannot correctly depict the lives of the people and cannot create artistic works with high ideological content. Our new democratic art must have profound ideological content, must be a weapon of struggle, and must serve the people. Our art workers, like workers in any other department, must improve their ideological level and must study constantly; otherwise, our art cannot move forward.

    金日成谈艺术问题
    号召艺术工作者提高政治水平
    创作具有高度思想性的作品
    【新华社平壤十七日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成在十二日接见出席第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节并访问苏联和各人民民主国家归来的朝鲜艺术代表团，并就朝鲜艺术问题发表了谈话。金日成首相首先赞扬朝鲜演员们在国外的演出对于加强朝鲜人民和各国人民的友谊所作的贡献。他指出：我们的演员在遥远的外国受到那样热烈的欢迎，说明了世界民主阵营对战斗中的朝鲜人民的巨大同情和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国日益增长的国际威信。金日成首相说：我们的文艺事业在自由发展的条件下，已经取得了不少的成就。解放后，我们的音乐、话剧、舞蹈等文艺活动，广泛地普及在人民群众中，产生了从人民群众中发掘出来的表现人民丰富的才能的艺术。但是，为了把我们的文艺事业提高到更高的水平，还须要做很多的努力。艺术工作者必须牢记和体会这样一个原则，即：只有当我们的艺术成为具备民族形式和民主内容、发扬国际主义精神和反对形式主义、具有深刻的思想性的艺术时，才能有成果地发展。
    金日成首相接着说：作曲家、剧作家、音乐家、舞蹈家和演员必须多多体验人民的生活，在创作工作中必须广泛地利用人民所创造的反映人民情感和要求的民族古典作品和民谣。但是，对于旧的艺术，必须以新的现代艺术的观点批判地加以吸收。我们的艺术只有当它能够正确地反映我们人民的现实处境及其英雄的斗争、当它不使人民倒退而鼓舞人民为着幸福的将来前进时，才能有成果地完成任务。
    我们的艺术要反映我们人民的民族特点，但是不能陷入狭隘的民族范畴。我们的艺术应该歌颂人民之间的友谊，发扬我们人民的国际主义感情。为了发展民族艺术，就必须研究苏联的先进艺术和我们友邦各国人民的艺术。在我们的民族基础上，吸收人家的优秀成果，这样就会促进我们艺术的发展，并加强我们和各国人民间的友谊关系。
    在发展艺术的途径中，最严重的障碍是形式主义。形式主义使形式和内容分离，使内容服从于形式而降低艺术的思想性、人民性及其表现。我们必须和它斗争。
    金日成首相指出：为了能够适应摆在我们面前的要求，我们的艺术工作者就必须经常注意提高自己的政治水平。不了解演变中的现实、不了解我们人民在做什么和往那里走的人，就不可能正确地描写人民的生活，就不可能创作出具有高度思想性的艺术作品。我们的新民主艺术，必须具有深刻的思想性，必须是斗争的武器，为人民服务。我们的艺术工作人员和其他任何部门的工作人员一样，必须提高自己的思想水平，必须经常学习；否则，我们的艺术就不可能向前发展。
