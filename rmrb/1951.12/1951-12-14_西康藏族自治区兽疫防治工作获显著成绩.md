The animal disease prevention and control work in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has achieved significant results in the past year under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government.

Yaks are the main tools for agricultural production and transportation for the people of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Before liberation, when rinderpest spread severely, yaks died in large numbers, and Tibetan people were impoverished. According to incomplete statistics from the counties north of Kangding between 1941 and 1942, more than 250,000 yaks died due to the epidemic of rinderpest. Last year, when the Central People's Government Southwest Visiting Group arrived in Xikang, it sent veterinary work cadres deep into the Tibetan areas to investigate the rinderpest situation and treat cattle. In May of this year, rinderpest broke out in Ganzi, Dengke, Qianning and other counties in northern Kangding. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government allocated 1 billion yuan to help the area purchase medicines and equipment, and sent veterinary experts to assist in the treatment. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Southwest Military and Political Committee also transferred more than 80 cadres to form an epidemic prevention team to go to extinguish rinderpest. While carrying out treatment work, the work team assisted the Tibetan Autonomous Region in establishing an Animal Disease Prevention and Control Committee, and ran short-term training courses to train 110 veterinary technical cadres of various ethnic groups. Veterinary epidemic prevention personnel in the Kangbei Tibetan area mobilized the vast Tibetan people to take emergency action, blockaded the epidemic area, isolated sick cattle, and buried dead cattle, stopping the spread of rinderpest in just over a month. By August, the area had treated more than 16,200 cattle and horses and eradicated rinderpest. The Tibetan people are very grateful for the care of the People's Government. Genxa, the deputy county chief of Dege County, said, "What we asked for more than ten years but could not get done during the Kuomintang rule, the People's Government has done for us in just over a year since liberation." After the epidemic prevention team cured his only horse, herdsman Gezhu said with tears in his eyes, "Chairman Mao is the leader of all our ethnic groups. May Chairman Mao live ten thousand years!"

Xinhua News Agency: In order to develop animal husbandry in the Tibetan areas on a large scale in the future, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently dispatched animal disease prevention experts to the Tibetan Autonomous Region to continue investigation and research, and to further carry out animal disease prevention and control work.

    西康藏族自治区兽疫防治工作获显著成绩
    西康省藏族自治区的兽疫防治工作，在人民政府领导和帮助下，一年来有显著的成绩。
    犛牛是藏族自治区人民农业生产和交通运输的主要工具。解放前，牛瘟蔓延严重时，犛牛成群死亡，藏族人民倾家荡产。据一九四一年到一九四二年间康定以北各县不完全的统计，因牛瘟流行，死亡的犛牛达二十五万头以上。去年中央人民政府西南访问团到达西康，曾派兽医工作干部深入藏区调查牛瘟情况和给牛治病。今年五月间，康北甘孜、邓柯、乾宁等县发生牛瘟，中央人民政府农业部拨款十亿元帮助该区购买药品器械，并派来兽医专家协助救治。西南军政委员会农林部也调了八十多个干部组成防疫队前往扑灭牛瘟。工作队一面进行治疗工作，一面协助藏族自治区成立了兽疫防治委员会，开办短期训练班，培养出各民族兽医技术干部一百一十人。兽医防疫人员在康北藏区发动广大藏族人民紧急动员起来，封锁疫区，隔离病牛，掩埋死牛，一个多月就制止了牛瘟的蔓延。到八月止，该区共防治了牛马一万六千二百多头，扑灭了牛瘟。藏族人民对人民政府的关怀非常感激。德格县副县长根呷说：“在国民党统治时期，我们要求了十几年没有办到的事，现在解放才一年多，人民政府就给我们办到了。”牧民各珠在防疫队医好了他仅有的一匹马后，他感动得流着眼泪说：“毛主席是我们各族人民的领袖，愿毛主席活一万岁！”
    为今后大规模地发展藏区畜牧事业，中央人民政府农业部最近派遣了兽疫防治专家到藏族自治区继续调查研究，进一步开展兽疫防治工作。（新华社）
