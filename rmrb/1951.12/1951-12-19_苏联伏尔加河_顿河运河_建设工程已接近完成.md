    Soviet Volga-Don Canal
    Construction Nears Completion
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch] The construction of the Soviet Volga-Don Canal is nearing completion. According to TASS: Seven of the thirteen locks built on the hundred-kilometer navigable canal connecting the Volga and Don rivers are nearing completion. The concrete pouring work has been completed. Many reservoirs, dams, and pumping stations have been completed. In order to prevent the cold climate from affecting the work speed of construction workers, Soviet engineers have invented new technologies for concrete works in winter, and special heating equipment has been installed along the canal. Workers are now assembling sturdy sluice gates and other equipment. Multi-story towers have been built near each sluice gate to house new operating devices. The construction workers decorating the canal banks with stone surfaces have completed this year's plan ahead of schedule and are now working according to next year's plan. Architects are busy building statues and various metal decorations along the navigable canal.
    In the main canal construction area—the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Project zone on the Don River—the construction of the thirteen-kilometer-long earth dam across the Don River is nearing completion. During the spring flood season next year, the world's largest artificial reservoir, "Tsimlyansk Sea," will appear near this earth dam. The assembly work is underway at the construction site of the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Power Station, and two giant turbines are being installed at an accelerated pace.
    After the completion of the great communist construction project of the Volga-Don Canal next spring, it will connect the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea into a single transportation system, benefiting 2.75 million hectares (equivalent to 41.25 million mu) of land in the Rostov and Stalingrad regions with irrigation and water supply. At the same time, agriculture in the Rostov region will also be extensively electrified.

    苏联伏尔加河—顿河运河
    建设工程已接近完成
    【新华社十八日讯】苏联伏尔加河—顿河运河的建设工程已接近完成。据塔斯社消息：在连接伏尔加河及顿河的长达一百公里的通航运河上兴建的十三道水闸，已有七道接近完工。浇灌水泥的工程已经完成。许多水库、堤坝和抽水站已经竣工。为了使建筑工人的工作速度不受到寒冷气候的影响，苏联工程师已经发明了在冬天进行水泥工程的新技术，运河沿线已装置了特殊的发热设备。现在工人们正在装配坚固的水门和其他设备。各个水门附近已经建造了几层楼高的高塔，以便安放新式的操纵装置。为运河两岸装修石面的建筑工人们，已经提前完成了今年的计划，现在正在按照明年的计划工作着。建筑师们正在忙着在通航运河沿线建造雕像和各种金属的装饰。
    在运河主要工程地区——顿河上的齐姆良水力工程地带，横跨顿河的长达十三公里的大土堤的工程即将完成。在明年春汛时期，这个土堤的附近将出现世界上最大的人工水库——“齐姆良海”。齐姆良水力发电站的工地已在进行装配工作，两座巨型的透平正在加紧安装。
    到明年春天，伏尔加河—顿河运河这个伟大的共产主义建设工程全部完工以后，将把白海、波罗的海、里海、亚速海和黑海连成单一的运输系统，使罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒两州的二百七十五万公顷
    （合四千一百二十五万市亩）的土地得到灌溉和供水之利。同时，罗斯多夫州的农业也将广泛电气化。
