    Carrying Out Ideological Remolding Movement
    To Learn from the Lessons of the "December 9th" Movement
    —Editorial of China Youth Daily Commemorating the Sixteenth Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement
    This year's commemoration of "December 9th" coincides with the nationwide launch of ideological remolding movements among teachers and students in schools, aiming to critique non-proletarian ideologies with proletarian ideology. In this regard, the "December 9th" Movement offers some experiences and lessons that we can learn from today.
    The "December 9th" Movement of sixteen years ago developed vigorously from the very beginning, eventually evolving into a nationwide anti-Japanese national salvation movement, becoming the prelude to the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan. The national independence and people's democracy demanded by the "December 9th" Movement have been fully realized, and the movement has been victorious. Why was it able to achieve victory? This must be attributed to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. In the "December 9th" Movement, the Chinese Communists clearly pointed out that educated youth should integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and guided students to go to the countryside and factories in their practical work. Especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "December 9th" students were tempered in the fiery struggle against the enemy by the people and their army, making them strong worker-peasant-oriented intellectual revolutionary cadres.
    Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong Thought, the "December 9th" Movement could have been a flash in the pan, or like some student movements in Chinese history, blossomed but failed to bear fruit. The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong Thought was implemented in all aspects of the movement from the beginning. The facts of the "December 9th" Movement prove that if at any time or in any aspect it did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, the movement at that time or in that aspect would show stagnation and losses.
    The "December 9th" Movement was a movement against imperialism and the Kuomintang's traitorous and reactionary government. The youth who participated in "December 9th" generally understood that only by resolutely opposing the Japanese invaders and their running dogs, and defeating them with the power of the people, could the Chinese nation achieve independence and the Chinese people achieve democracy. However, how to resolutely oppose the Japanese invaders and their running dogs, and how to achieve victory? The proletarian ideology and the petty-bourgeois ideology have completely different views and handling of this issue. Here we only mention that within the student camp participating in the "December 9th" Movement, there were also various forms of petty-bourgeois ideology. And these petty-bourgeois ideas were also spreading everywhere, attempting to expand their influence. Some of this was manifested in the advocacy of the anti-Japanese national united front. The united front they envisioned was not based on the workers and peasants as the main body, or the Communist Party and the people's revolutionary forces as the main body, but on the Kuomintang reactionary government as the main body. In the student movement, they wanted to take the Kuomintang-run pseudo-student organizations as the main body. They put forward the slogan of "unconditional unity," and even advocated that revolutionary organizations such as the Student National Salvation Federation and the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard should be abolished in order to achieve "unity." Some people also opposed the leadership of proletarian ideology, and wrote the so-called "Declaration of Independence of Youth Thought," advocating that youth should neither believe in the Communist Party nor believe in the Kuomintang. This was actually the illusion of the petty-bourgeois third road. In addition, there was a "left" ideological tendency, which put forward slogans that were too high and unacceptable to the majority of the masses in their work, attempting to break away from the masses and fight alone. Both the "left" adventurism and the right capitulationist ideas were quickly criticized and corrected. These erroneous ideas were not allowed to grow and occupy a dominant position in practical work. The Student National Salvation Federation and the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard were not abolished, but greatly developed. The "third road" was abandoned by the revolutionary masses under the leadership of the Party, and the movement did not fight alone but increasingly united the broad masses. The leadership of proletarian ideology directly guaranteed the victory of the movement. If those petty-bourgeois ideas were allowed to lead, the ranks would collapse, the masses would disperse, and what future would there be for the movement other than failure?
    The "December 9th" Movement, like any revolutionary movement, could not succeed without the leadership of the Communist Party and Mao Zedong Thought. This is because if the proletarian ideology does not occupy a leading position, then the non-proletarian ideology—such as the petty-bourgeois ideology—will occupy a leading position. The subjectivity and one-sidedness of the petty-bourgeois ideology make them sway left and right in the struggle against the enemy. Proletarian ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology cannot and will never coexist peacefully. If a movement led by proletarian ideology does not transform the petty-bourgeois ideology, it will be eroded by the petty-bourgeois ideology, causing the movement to change its face and suffer failure. Therefore, for the benefit of the people and the revolution, it is entirely necessary to transform the petty-bourgeois ideology and promote its proletarianization. On the sixteenth anniversary of the "December 9th," the whole country has been liberated for two years. Great achievements have been made in all aspects of the construction of the motherland. On the basis of the continuous progress of the new China, in order to continue to move forward, consolidate the original victory, and open up a better future, Chairman Mao put forward the issue of ideological remolding. To carry out this ideological remolding movement today, we must learn from the lessons of the "December 9th," recognize what kind of harm non-proletarian ideology can cause to the revolution if it occupies a leading position, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and use proletarian ideology to criticize non-proletarian ideology and determine our determination to serve the people. Theory is important to revolutionary intellectuals, and we must study the theory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Practice is of greater importance to revolutionary intellectuals, and we must participate in revolutionary practice and combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers to seek our own transformation.
    Sixteen years ago, the educated youth of the "December 9th" era were working hard to study revolutionary theory and striving to combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants, but at that time they were in reactionary ruling areas, and the reactionary rulers did not allow students to have the freedom to study revolutionary theory and go to the masses of workers and peasants. The students of "December 9th" did not completely solve this problem until the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the people's own revolutionary base areas. At present, the whole country has been liberated, and the people's own regime advocates that everyone study theory and combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, giving us complete freedom to study theory and go to the masses. However, this only provides us with the premise and foundation for ideological remolding. To completely solve ideological problems, it is necessary to be determined, have ideological struggles, and undergo the test and exercise of long-term struggle practice.
    Today's educated youth have made great progress compared with the time of the "December 9th" Movement, and they also have better conditions for self-remolding. We believe that as long as we are determined, ideological remolding will definitely be completely successful.

    进行思想改造运动
    要吸取“一二、九”的教训
    ——中国青年报纪念“一二、九”运动十六周年的社论
    今年纪念“一二、九”，正值全国各地学校师生开始展开思想改造运动，要以无产阶级思想批判非无产阶级思想。关于这方面，“一二、九”运动中有一些经验教训，是可供我们今天来借镜的。
    十六年前的“一二、九”运动，从一开始就蓬蓬勃勃地发展，一直发展到全国规模的抗日救国运动，成为中国人民抗日战争的序幕。“一二、九”运动所要求的民族独立与人民民主，业已完全实现，这个运动是胜利了。为什么它能够得到胜利呢？这必须归功于中国共产党的领导，毛泽东思想的领导。中国共产党人在“一二、九”运动中明确地指出了知识青年要和广大工农群众相结合，并且在实际工作中引导青年学生到农村去、到工厂去。特别是在抗日战争中，在人民大众和他们的军队的火热的对敌斗争中，锻炼了“一二、九”的学生们，使之成为坚强的工农化的知识分子革命干部。
    如果没有中国共产党和毛泽东思想的领导，“一二、九”运动也有可能昙花一现，也有可能如中国历史上有些学生运动一样，开了花也不能结实。中国共产党的领导和毛泽东思想的领导从运动开始起就贯彻到运动的各个方面。“一二、九”运动中的事实证明，如果在某一时候或某一方面不合乎毛泽东思想，那一时候或那一方面的运动，就表现出迟滞和损失。
    “一二、九”运动是反对帝国主义和国民党卖国反动政府的运动，参加“一二、九”的青年们，一般地是懂得只有坚决反对日寇及其走狗，并以人民的力量战胜他们，中国民族才能独立，中国人民才能得到民主。但是，究竟怎样坚决反对日寇及其走狗，如何得到胜利？无产阶级思想与小资产阶级思想对这个问题的看法和处理就是完全不同的。我们这里只提及参加“一二、九”运动的学生阵营内部，也有过各种形态的小资产阶级思想。而且这些小资产阶级思想也曾四处散布，企图扩大影响。其中有一部分是表现在对抗日民族统一战线的主张上，他们所想的统一战线不是以工农人民为主体，以共产党和人民的革命力量为主体，而是想以国民党反动政府为主体，在学生运动中就是要以国民党官办的伪学生团体为主体。他们提出了“无条件的统一”口号，甚至主张不惜将学生救国联合会、中华民族解放先锋队等革命组织取消以求得“统一”。又有人反对无产阶级思想领导，写了所谓“青年思想独立宣言”，主张青年应当既不相信共产党也不相信国民党。这实际上是小资产阶级第三条道路的幻想。另外，还有一种“左”的思想倾向，在工作中提出过高的不能为大多数群众所接受的口号，企图脱离群众进行孤军作战。“左”的冒险主义和右的投降主义的思想，都很快地被批判、被纠正。没有容许这些错误思想滋长起来，在实际工作当中占有统治地位。学生救国联合会和中华民族解放先锋队不是取消，而是大大地发展。“第三条道路”被党领导下的革命群众所唾弃，运动不是孤军作战而是日益团结了广大群众。无产阶级思想的领导，直接保证了运动的胜利。如果让那些小资产阶级思想来领导，队伍将会垮台，群众将会走散，运动除了失败还有什么前途呢？
    “一二、九”运动正和任何革命运动一样，没有共产党和毛泽东思想的领导是不能成功的。这是因为：如果无产阶级思想不占有领导地位，则非无产阶级思想——例如小资产阶级思想就要占有领导地位。小资产阶级思想的主观性与片面性，使得他们在对敌斗争中发生左右摇摆的现象。无产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想是不可能也绝不会和平共居的。无产阶级思想领导的运动，如果不去改造小资产阶级思想，就会被小资产阶级思想所侵蚀，使得运动改变了面貌而遭受到失败。因此，为了人民和革命的利益，把小资产阶级思想加以改造，促进它无产阶级化的过程，是完全必要的。“一二、九”十六周年的今天，全国解放已经二年了。祖国各方面的建设都得到伟大的成就。在新中国不断前进的基础上，为了继续前进，巩固原有的胜利，开辟更美好的前途，毛主席提出了思想改造问题。今天来进行这一思想改造运动，我们就必须吸取“一二、九”的教训，认清楚非无产阶级思想如果占了领导地位会对革命发生怎样的危害，分清敌我界限，以无产阶级思想，批判非无产阶级思想，确定为人民服务的决心。理论对于革命知识分子是重要的，我们必须学习马列主义和毛泽东思想的理论。实践对于革命知识分子是具有更多的重要性的，我们又必须参加革命的实践，和工农兵结合，以求得自己的改造。
    十六年前，“一二、九”时代的知识青年，是在努力学习革命理论并努力与广大工农群众结合的，但当时处在反动统治地区，反动统治者不让学生有学习革命理论与到工农群众中去的自由。“一二、九”的学生，直到抗日战争开始，在人民自己的革命根据地中才彻底解决了这个问题。目前全国业已解放，人民自己的政权提倡大家学习理论，提倡和工农兵结合，给我们学习理论与到群众中去的完全自由。但是，这还只是供给我们以思想改造的前提和基础。彻底地解决思想问题，那是需要下决心，需要有思想斗争，需要经过长期斗争实践的考验和锻炼的。
    今天的知识青年，比起“一二、九”运动的时候，有了很大的进步，也有了更好的自我改造的条件，我们相信只要下定决心，思想改造一定完全能够得到成功。
