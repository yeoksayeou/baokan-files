    Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Vietnamese People's Resistance Against French Aggressors
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh Issues Letter to the Nation's Military and Civilians
    Calling for Overcoming Difficulties, Strengthening Unity, and Striving for Complete Victory
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 19th] According to Vietnam News Agency's report from North Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a letter to the nation's military and civilians to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Vietnamese people's resistance against French aggressors (December 19th).
    In his letter to the nation's military and civilians, Chairman Ho Chi Minh first compared the situation in Vietnam at the beginning of the anti-aggression war with the situation today, pointing out that the crisis in the imperialist war camp is deepening, the strength of the peace and democracy camp is growing, and the international situation is increasingly favorable to the Vietnamese people's anti-aggression war.
    Next, Chairman Ho Chi Minh analyzed the current domestic situation in Vietnam, saying: We began fighting the French imperialist aggressors shortly after seizing power. It can be said that we initially rose up to fight our enemies empty-handed. But we have strengthened our forces in battle. We have built a strong People's Army, in addition to many local People's Army units, militias, and guerrillas. We have annihilated more than 170,000 enemy troops. Our struggle is costing the French imperialists 1 billion francs every day.
    A few years ago, we were still surrounded by the French aggressors and the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries. But thanks to the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, and the great victory we soon won against the French aggressors in the border areas, our country has been connected with other democratic countries in the world. We owe these achievements to the heroic struggle and self-sacrificing spirit of our army and people.
    The Second Session of the World Peace Council recently passed several resolutions, including one on achieving peace in Vietnam and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Vietnam. We welcome these resolutions. It is precisely in order to implement these resolutions that we are determined to fight to the end until we win complete victory, until the French aggressors withdraw or are completely annihilated.
    However, our army and people must always remember: all aggressors, except for the dead, are capable of evil. The closer they get to collapse, the more cruel they become. Our struggle will surely be victorious, but it will be after a long and arduous struggle.
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh then pointed out the direction of the Vietnamese people's future efforts: We should continue to strengthen all the efforts we are making now, namely: further strengthen our internal unity with the fraternal people of Laos and Cambodia, as well as our unity with friendly countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and other New Democracies; commanders and fighters of the People's Army, local People's Army units, militias, and guerrillas should engage in a competition movement to annihilate the enemy, strive for meritorious service, and help the people; people of all walks of life—workers, peasants, intellectuals, and merchants—should engage in a competition movement to increase production; staff members of government agencies and people's organizations should engage in a competition movement to promote diligence, thrift, impartiality, and integrity, to correctly implement government policies, and to correctly implement the mass line.
    We should also overcome all difficulties to smash the enemy's plot to "use war to feed war" and to "use Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese."
    We warmly applaud the struggle of the people in the enemy-occupied areas against the enemy's policy of forcibly conscripting young people to supplement the puppet army.
    We call on the puppet soldiers who have been deceived by the enemy to return to their motherland.
    We are determined to overcome all difficulties in order to realize the slogan "Everything for the front, everything for victory."
    In the final part of his letter to the nation's military and civilians, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out: The Vietnamese people's anti-aggression war will surely be victorious because: the French colonialists and American interventionists are all aggressors; those puppets are all traitors; we are fighting to defend our motherland.
    We will surely be victorious because: our army fights heroically; our people are united; our cadres are loyal to the country; our government has foresight and determination.
    We will surely be victorious because the strength of our camp—the camp of peace and democracy—exceeds that of the imperialist war camp.
    Our long struggle will surely be victorious!
    Long live the independence and unity of Vietnam!

    纪念越南人民抵抗法国侵略者五周年
    胡志明主席发表告全国军民书
    号召克服困难加强团结争取完全胜利
    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席为纪念越南全国人民抵抗法国侵略者五周年（十二月十九日），发表告全国军民书。
    胡志明主席在告全国军民书中，首先把反侵略战争开始的时候和今天的越南情况作一比较，指出帝国主义战争阵营的危机日益加深，和平民主阵营的力量日益强大，国际形势对于越南人民的反侵略战争正日益有利。
    接着，胡志明主席分析越南今天的国内形势说：我们掌握政权不久，就开始和法帝国主义侵略军作战。可以说，我们当初是赤手空拳地起来和我们的敌人作战的。但是我们已在战斗中加强了我们的力量。我们建立了一支强大的人民军，另有许多地方人民军、民兵和游击队。我们歼灭了敌军十七万多人。我们的斗争使法帝国主义者每天消耗十亿法郎。
    几年以前，我们还受到法国侵略者和中国国民党反动派的包围。但是由于中国人民革命的胜利，以及不久以后我们在边境地区对法国侵略军赢得的伟大胜利，已使我国和世界上的其他民主国家连接起来了。我们获得了这些成绩，应归功于我们的军队和人民的英勇斗争和他们的自我牺牲精神。
    最近世界和平理事会第二次会议通过了几项决议，其中包括关于在越南实现和平、外国军队撤出越南的决议。我们欢迎这些决议。正是为了要实现这些决议，我们决心奋战到底，直到赢得完全胜利，直到法国侵略军撤退或被完全歼灭为止。
    然而，我们的军队和人民必须经常记住：所有的侵略者，除掉死的而外，都是会作恶的。他们愈接近崩溃，就变得愈加残酷。我们的斗争一定会得到胜利，但是要经过一个长期的、艰苦的斗争。
    胡志明主席接着指出越南人民今后努力的方向说：我们应该继续加强我们现在所作的一切努力，那就是：进一步加强我们和老挝和柬埔寨两国的兄弟人民的内部团结，以及我们和苏联、中国及其他新民主主义国家等友邦的团结；人民军、地方人民军、民兵和游击队的指挥员、战斗员应该进行歼灭敌人、争取立功和帮助人民的竞赛运动；各阶层的人民——工人、农民、知识分子和商人——应该进行增加生产的竞赛运动；政府机关和人民团体的工作人员应该在发扬勤俭、公正和廉洁的作风方面，在正确执行政府的政策和正确执行群众路线方面，进行竞赛运动。
    我们还应该克服一切困难，来粉碎敌人的以战养战、利用越南人打越南人的阴谋。
    我们要对敌占区人民反对敌人强征青年补充傀儡军的政策的斗争，热烈欢呼。
    我们要号召受敌人欺骗的傀儡军回到他们的祖国这边来。
    我们决心克服一切困难，以便实现“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的口号。
    胡志明主席在告全国军民书的最后部分指出：越南人民的反侵略战争一定会得到胜利，因为：法国殖民者和美国干涉者都是侵略者；那些傀儡们都是卖国贼；我们是在为保卫祖国而战。
    我们一定会得到胜利，因为：我们的军队英勇奋战；我们的人民团结一致；我们的干部忠诚为国；我们的政府具有远见和决心。
    我们一定会得到胜利，因为我们的阵营——和平民主阵营——的力量超过帝国主义战争阵营。
    我们的长期斗争一定会得到胜利！
    越南的独立和统一万岁！
