    Changping County People's Court Suppresses People's Criticism
    Abuses Power to Unreasonably Summon Ren Shuzhen
    Higher-Level Judicial Organs Should Immediately Investigate and Handle

    Editor: After reading the article "Why Doesn't the Changping County People's Court Act According to the Marriage Law?" published on page three of the People's Daily on November 26th, we believe it accurately reflects the facts. However, instead of accepting the criticism from the Party newspaper, the Changping County People's Court has been making things difficult for the appellant, Ren Shuzhen.

    At 10:00 AM on November 28th, the court called our district office and asked us to send Ren Shuzhen to the court. That afternoon, Ren Shuzhen arrived in Changping City. The next day (November 29th) at 10:00 AM, she went to the court. Ren Biyun, a cadre of the court, said to Ren Shuzhen, "You go outside first!" Ren Shuzhen stood outside for about twenty minutes before being called into the room. Upon entering, the president of the court said to her, "It's good that you published in the newspaper, helping the government investigate cases!" Ren Shuzhen said, "You're looking for me because of the newspaper publication. If you see anything wrong, please point it out." The president of the court, looking displeased, said, "The first sentence is wrong! (Editor's note: The first sentence of the article "Why Doesn't the Changping County People's Court Act According to the Marriage Law?" published on page three of the People's Daily on November 26th was: "I am Ren Shuzhen from Mengzu Village, Fourth District, Changping County, Hebei Province.") What basis did you have for publishing in the newspaper?" Ren Shuzhen said, "I keep a diary every time I come to the court." The president of the court said, "Let me see your diary!" Ren Shuzhen said, "I left it in Beijing." The president of the court said, "You're lying!" Ren Shuzhen said, "I am a Youth League member, I wouldn't lie!" The president of the court said, "The court doesn't lie either, let alone you Youth League members!" The president got angry and scared Ren Shuzhen to tears. After a while, the court personnel took out a written self-criticism and read it to Ren Shuzhen. According to Ren Shuzhen, "There were incorrect things in their self-criticism. Some things they insisted they didn't say. There were many of them, and I was too scared to say anything!"

    We completely agree with the "Brief Comment on Political and Legal Work" in the People's Daily on November 26th regarding the criticism of the Changping County People's Court, and believe that it was improper for the Changping County People's Court to summon Ren Shuzhen for criticism this time. If there were inaccuracies in Ren Shuzhen's article published in the People's Daily, the Changping County People's Court should have explained it in the newspaper. In no way should they have unreasonably summoned Ren Shuzhen for questioning. We believe that this behavior of the Changping County People's Court is an act of suppressing criticism and should be deeply criticized.

    Yan Keping, District Chief of the Fourth District of Changping County
    Yang Zelin, Organization Committee Member of the Fourth District Committee of the CCP Changping County
    Wang Yue, Deputy Secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League Changping County
    Sun Liying, Propaganda Committee Member of the Democratic Women's Federation of the Fourth District of Changping County

    Editor's note: The situation reflected by Comrade Yan Keping, District Chief of the Fourth District of Changping County, Hebei Province, and others, regarding the Changping County People's Court making things difficult for and summoning Ren Shuzhen, slandering the Youth League, and suppressing people's criticism, is absolutely intolerable. Our people's judicial organs must eliminate this extremely bad style. Recently, we also received a letter from Comrade Zhang Xinye, District Chief of the Second District of Changping County, regarding the Changping County People's Court's erroneous handling of Zhang Shuqing's divorce case, as well as letters from readers like Li Zhende in Chicheng County, Chahar Province, regarding the Changping County People's Court's delay in handling Yu Leilei's divorce case. These letters all reflect the seriousness of the Changping County People's Court's irresponsibility towards work and the people. We suggest that the Hebei Provincial People's Court and the Tongxian Special District Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court immediately investigate the work of the Changping County People's Court and severely punish those cadres who disregard national laws and disciplines, abuse their powers, and oppress the people.

    昌平县人民法院压制人民批评
    滥用职权无理传讯任淑珍
    上级司法机关应即检查处理
    编辑同志：十一月二十六日人民日报第三版刊载的“昌平县人民法院为什么不按婚姻法办事？”一文，我们看过之后，认为和事实没有出入。但是，昌平县人民法院并没有接受党报的批评，反而刁难申诉者任淑珍。
    十一月二十八日上午十时，法院给我区区公所打来电话，叫我们传任淑珍去法院。当日下午，任淑珍到了昌平城。第二天（二十九日）上午十点钟她去了法院。法院的干部任碧云对任淑珍说：“你先出去吧！”任淑珍在外边站了有二十分钟，才被人叫进屋里去。进了屋里，院长向她说：“你给我们登出报来是很好的，帮助政府查查案件！”任淑珍说：“你找我是为登报的事。看那点不对，请你提出来。”院长脸色很不好看地说：“头一句就不对！（编者按：本报十一月二十六日第三版所载“昌平县人民法院为什么不按婚姻法办事？”一文第一句为：“我是河北省昌平县四区孟祖村人，叫任淑珍。”）你给我们登报有什么根据？”任淑珍说：“我每次到法院来都记有日记。”院长说：“你拿日记本给我看！”任淑珍说：“我放在北京啦。”院长说：“你胡说！”任淑珍说：“我是一个青年团员，不会说谎的！”院长说：“法院还胡说呢，何况你们青年团！”院长发了脾气，把任淑珍吓哭了。一会儿，法院的人拿出他们写好的检讨念给任淑珍听。据任淑珍说：“他们的检讨有不对的地方。有些话他们硬说没说过。他们人多，吓得我也不敢说啦！”
    我们完全同意十一月二十六日人民日报“政法工作简评”对昌平县人民法院的批评，并认为昌平县人民法院这次又把任淑珍传去批评，实属不当。如果说任淑珍在人民日报发表的文章有不合事实的地方，昌平县人民法院应在报上说明，无论如何也不应无理地把任淑珍传去讯问。我们认为，昌平县人民法院的这种行为，是压制批评的行为，应当深刻检讨。

    中共昌平县第四区委员会组织委员　杨泽霖
    中国新民主主义青年团昌平县第四区委员会副书记
    王　悦
    昌平县第四区民主妇女联合会宣传委员　孙立英
    编者按：河北省昌平县第四区区长阎克平同志等所反映的昌平县人民法院刁难和传讯任淑珍，诬蔑青年团，以及压制人民批评的情形，是绝对不能容忍的。我们人民的司法机关必须肃清这种极端恶劣的作风。最近我们还收到昌平县第二区区长张辛野同志关于昌平县人民法院错误处理张淑青离婚案的来信，以及察哈尔省赤城县读者李振德等对昌平县人民法院拖延处理于砳磊离婚案的来信。这些来信都反映出昌平县人民法院对工作、对人民不负责任的严重性。我们建议河北省人民法院及河北省人民法院通县专区分院应即检查昌平县人民法院的工作，并严厉处分那些蔑视国家法纪、滥用职权、欺压人民的违法干部。
