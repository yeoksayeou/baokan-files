    Oppose the Indiscriminate Issuance, Distribution, and Collection of Bulletins
    Comrade Editor: I believe that the indiscriminate issuance, distribution, and collection of bulletins by some government agencies in various regions is a great waste.
    Take the Shanghai News and Publications Office as an example. There are eighty types of bulletins, special issues, and commemorative publications sent from various regions, accumulating to 1,335 copies in a year and a half. If the cost of each book is calculated at 3,000 yuan, the value would be more than 4 million yuan. Some of them are valuable for reference, but most of the content is repetitive.
    In order to respond to the call for increased production and thrift, I believe that government agencies, factories, enterprises, people's organizations, schools, etc., in various regions should conduct a comprehensive and strict inspection and cleanup: those that should be discontinued should be discontinued, and those that should be merged should be merged; the bulletins and publications that need to be published should improve their quality. The units receiving bulletins and publications should also take a responsible attitude towards the people and the country, receiving what should be received, and returning what should be returned (notifying the other party not to send them). We oppose the phenomenon of indiscriminate collection and distribution.

    反对滥出、滥发和滥收公报
    编辑同志：我认为各地某些政府机关滥出、滥发和滥收公报，都是极大的浪费。
    举上海新闻出版处为例，各地寄来的公报、特刊、纪念刊等共有八十种，一年半来积存一、三三五本，如每本成本按三千元计算，价值就在四百万元以上。其中部分是有参考价值的，但大部分内容重复。
    为了响应增产节约的号召，我认为各地政府机关、工厂、企业、人民团体、学校等，都应该普遍地、严格地进行一次检查与清理：该停刊的停刊，该合并的合并；必要出版的公报和刊物，应该提高质量。收受公报和刊物的单位，也应该以对人民对国家负责的态度，该收的收，该退的退（通知对方不必寄来）。我们反对滥收、滥发的现象。
