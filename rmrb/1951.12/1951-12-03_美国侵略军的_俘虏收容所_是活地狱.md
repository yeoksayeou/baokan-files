    The U.S. Aggressor's "Prisoner of War Camp" is a Living Hell
    Korean People's Army Soldier Cui Shang'en
    The American military's so-called "prisoner of war camp" is, in reality, a living hell in name and in fact. Now, whenever I think of that bloody interrogation room, the gallows, and the savage atrocities I witnessed, I can't help but shudder; the desire for revenge explodes within me like a bomb.
    I was held in this so-called "prisoner of war camp" for about three weeks, barely clinging to life, and subjected to many tortures and abuses.
    The "camp" was established on a small peninsula in Gyeongsangnam-do. The local people call it "Dead Man's Island" or "Living Hell." Those imprisoned inside ranged from sixteen-year-old children to elderly men in their seventies.
    The murderous and unblinking butchers of the American and Rhee armies arbitrarily tortured and murdered those imprisoned in this living hell. People, suffering from terrible torments and afflicted by hunger and cold, were groaning in despair.
    One day, it was the second day after I was押进 (forcibly brought to) the "camp."
    The fingernails and toenails of a young woman had all been pulled out, and she was covered in blood from head to toe, lying on the ground weakly moaning.
    Among our People's Army prisoners, one comrade lost his mind because he was beaten too severely with iron chains and clubs. He was truly insane. However, the beasts still placed a heavy yoke around his neck. As a result, he was tortured to death.
    A young man named Park Eui became completely deaf in both ears from severe beatings. Later, he was dragged out and never returned.
    Several of us were often taken out in the dead of night, transported away in trucks. Where did they go? One dark night, under the strict surveillance of many "military police," American executioners threw a heavy package into a shell crater and then buried it with earth.
    Some people had their hands and feet crippled due to hunger and excessive torture. These people were among those dragged away.
    It was common for the "military police" to punch and kick us. Once, the enemy forced us to carry heavy packages of goods. We had no strength, and many people lay down and refused to move; this angered the beasts. The American soldiers barked madly, and then dragged away those who had lain down, one by one, drove them to the seaside, and fired at them with machine guns. They died miserably, their bodies falling into the water, turning the sea red.
    Because I refused to bow my head before the enemy, I, along with another comrade, was stripped naked, tied up tightly with ropes, and given a severe beating. They used iron chains and large wooden clubs. After the beating, the enemy took me to a torture chamber that was both fishy and foul-smelling, with a very pungent odor. I suffered horrific torture there. To prevent me from making any noise, the enemy first stuffed my mouth with rags, and then burned me with red-hot iron rods; the skin on my body sizzled and sizzled. Finally, I was held under water until I passed out.
    A few days later, the beasts again wrapped our eyes with cloth, me and another comrade, and drove us on with leather shoes and rifle butts. We walked for a while and arrived at the gallows. Many bodies were hanging on the platform. One young deceased appeared to be missing his eyes. A dying woman was also hanging on the platform, trying to break free from her bound hands, blood streaming from her eyes, her body convulsing. At that moment, I no longer felt like I was in the human world.
    In a corner of the room, American beast soldiers and "military police" tied a girl of about fifteen or sixteen years old to a wooden stake and shot her five times in the head and chest. I fainted with anger!
    The American devils escorting us muttered something to the "military police," and then the beasts said to us, "How do you like the show? Do you understand now?" As they spoke, they shrugged their shoulders, emitting sinister laughter with satisfaction. Are they even human!
    That night we had no food to eat, and it wasn't until the afternoon of the next day that we were given some porridge made from moldy flour. The sufferers in the "camp" were afflicted with various malignant diseases, and a batch of dead were carried out every day.
    I endured three weeks there, suffering countless hardships. One day, I suddenly heard that we were to be escorted to Busan. So, I and others were loaded onto trucks and transported away. The trucks drove for about two hours, and when I saw the shape of the mountains there, I remembered: I had been to this place once. Last September, when our People's Army drove the American and Rhee armies into a panicked retreat near Busan, we had come here—near Masan. I also remembered Jirisan Mountain, where our guerrillas were. I made up my mind that I would never let go of this excellent opportunity.
    The two guards kept firing shots into the air to intimidate us. Apparently, one of the guns was broken. That guy took it apart to fix it; the truck was going downhill. The opportunity was now or never, I leaped out, fled into the bushes, and ran. The guard with the gun shouted at the top of his lungs and fired at me repeatedly. The other one used the broken gun to "knock" on the truck. I burrowed into the grass, which was taller than a person, and desperately ran towards the mountainous area. The next afternoon, I met an old man in the deep mountains, and he led me to the guerrillas.
    I will expose the truth of the beasts' mistreatment of prisoners of war to the whole world.

### 美国侵略军的“俘虏收容所”是活地狱

    美国侵略军的“俘虏收容所”是活地狱
    朝鲜人民军战士  崔尚恩
    美军的所谓“俘虏收容所”实际上是名符其实的活地狱。现在我一旦想起了那血腥的审问室、绞首台，以及我所见的野兽暴行，不禁为之毛骨悚然；复仇的心，好像炸弹一样地爆炸起来。
    我在这所谓“俘虏收容所”里，奄奄待毙地住了约三个星期，遭受了许多酷刑和虐待。
    那“收容所”建立在庆尚南道的一个小半岛上。当地老百姓叫它“死人岛”，或叫“活地狱”。里面被囚禁的人们，有从十六岁的小孩到七十多岁的老人。
    杀人不眨眼的屠夫美李匪军，任意拷打和虐杀被囚禁在活地狱里的人们。人们因受了许多可怕的折磨，加之饥寒交迫，正在绝望地呻吟着。
    一天，正是我被押进“收容所”的第二天。
    一位青年妇女的手指甲与脚指甲全被拔光了，混身上下成了个血人，躺在地上无力地呻吟着。
    在我们人民军俘虏中，有一位同志因被铁索和棍棒殴打过重而精神失常了。他确实地是精神失常了。然而，野兽们仍然在他的脖子上套着一面沉重的枷。结果他给折磨死了。
    有一位青年名叫朴谊，因挨打过重，两只耳朵全聋了。后来他又被拉了出去，再也没有回来。
    我们中间，时常有几个人，在深更半夜被带出去，被用卡车带走。他们到那儿去了呢？有一天黑夜中，在许多“宪兵”森严的监视下，美国刽子手将一个沉重的大包裹扔进炮弹坑里，然后用土埋上。
    有一些人，因饥饿和受刑过重而手脚都残废了。这些人都在被拖走之列。
    “宪兵”对我们拳打脚踢，乃是家常便饭。有一次敌人逼迫我们搬沉重的货物包裹。我们那有力气，许多人都躺下不动；这就触怒了野兽。只听美军咕噜咕噜地狂吠，接着就把躺了下来的人一个个拖走，赶到海边上，用机枪猛烈扫射。他们凄惨地死去了，尸体倒在水里，海水染成了红色。
    我也是因为不肯在敌人面前低头，和另一位同志一起，身上的衣服被剥光了，再被用绳子捆紧，遭了一顿毒打。他们用的是铁索和粗大的木棒。打过之后，敌人就将我带进一间又腥又臭、非常呛鼻子的刑室。我在那里受了骇人听闻的酷刑。为了不使我出声，敌人先将我的嘴用破布塞了起来，再用烧红了的铁棍烫我，我身上烧得吱吱地冒油。最后，我被按到水里浸，我晕过去了。
    几天之后，野兽又用布将我和另一位同志的眼裹住，用皮鞋和枪托子赶着走。我们走了一阵，到了绞首台。台上吊着许多尸体。有一个年龄不大的死者，好像没了眼睛。台上还吊着一个垂死的女人，她企图用力挣脱被反绑着的手，眼睛流着血，躯体在抽搐。我当时已不觉得是在人的世界上。
    在一个屋角旁，美国兽兵军和“宪兵”们将一位年约十五、六岁的女孩子，反绑在木桩上，用枪在她的头部和胸部射击了五枪。我气昏了！
    押解我们的美国鬼子，不知和“宪兵”咕噜了些什么，接着，野兽对我们说：“玩艺儿看得怎样？晓得了没有？”说着，耸耸肩膀，满意地发出狞笑。他们还是人吗！
    那天晚上我们没有饭吃，直到第二天下午，才吃到了一些用发霉的面熬成的粥。“收容所”里受难者患着各种恶性病，每天都有一批死者抬出去。
    我在那里熬过了三个星期，受尽了数不尽的痛苦。有一天，我忽听说要将我们押解到釜山。于是，我和其他人一起，被装上卡车运走。卡车开行约两小时，我一看那里的山形就想起了：原来这个地方我到过一次。去年九月我们人民军将美李匪军赶得屁滚尿流地迫近釜山时，曾来到这里——马山附近。我又想起了智异山，那里有我们的游击队。我下了决心，绝不放过这一绝好机会。
    两个监视兵不住地放空枪威吓。大概有一枝枪坏了。那个家伙就将零件拆下修理；车在走下坡路。迫不容缓的机会到了，我纵身一跃，逃进草丛，撒腿就跑。拿枪的监视兵，拉着嗓子叫喊，并用枪接二连三地向我射击。另外一个就用坏了的枪
    “吭”“吭”地敲着卡车。我就钻进比人还高的草丛，拚命地向着山岭地带跑去。第二天下午，我在深山里遇着一位老人，他带我找到了游击队。
    我要把野兽们虐待俘虏的真象，向全世界控诉。
