With the improvement of the national financial and economic situation, the industrial and commercial circles in Suzhou, like those throughout the country, have gradually developed. The number of industrial and commercial households in the city this year has increased by 53% compared to 1949. This year, the summer season, which was usually the off-season, has become the peak season: the turnover this summer increased by 106% compared to the spring season and by 82% compared to last summer. The patriotic enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles in the city has also greatly improved. Many industrial and commercial households have begun to focus on rural areas, improve their operations, and actively pay national taxes. In order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, the city's industrial and commercial circles overfulfilled the plan to donate thirteen fighter planes.

However, it must be pointed out that some industrialists and businessmen in Suzhou, with the improvement of their business, have developed a tendency to deviate from the state's economic leadership, such as pursuing exorbitant profits, reducing the quality of goods, and failing to comply with contracts and agreements. Many industrialists and businessmen also evade national taxes, harming the interests of the state. In order to correct these erroneous thoughts and behaviors and welcome the further improvement of industry and commerce, Suzhou held a private enterprise production and operation transformation exhibition from November 5th to December 2nd. The purpose of the exhibition was to expose the malpractices of past operations, introduce the achievements of the past two years, and point out the direction of future production and operation. More than 130 industries in the city participated in the exhibition. More than 4,300 items of charts, models, and physical objects were exhibited. Many of the exhibits exposed the methods used by industrialists and businessmen to seek exorbitant profits in the past, such as cutting corners, using fake and shoddy goods, and using illegal weights and measures. During the twenty-eight days of the exhibition, a total of 100,000 people visited, and many groups from other places rushed to visit.

During the preparation and exhibition period, various industries held professional meetings or symposiums to deliberate and discuss how to eliminate malpractices, improve production, and improve operations. The Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Production Guidance Office of the exhibition also organized working teams to cooperate with the trade associations of various industries to conduct investigations and research in various industries, and assist in convening professional meetings to formulate next year's production plans or business plans, so as to gradually start planned operations.

On November 14th, the Suzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce convened more than 400 representatives from various industries to hold an "Anti-Profiteering" and "Anti-Speculation" education conference. The meeting exposed the behavior of some industrialists and businessmen who did not seek self-transformation and even violated government decrees, engaged in speculation, and sought exorbitant profits. At the meeting, three industrial and commercial households who had engaged in speculation and raised prices made self-criticisms. After the meeting, various industries generally organized communication and discussion. Some industrialists and businessmen conducted criticism and self-criticism in the discussion. For example, the capitalist of Xiesheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory reviewed and said: "Our business only improved when we processed and wove for state-owned companies; recently, we had financial difficulties, and the state-owned company purchased more than 400 bolts of bed sheet cloth, which solved our difficulties. However, we did not thank the government, but instead wanted to raise the processing fees in the peak season to seek exorbitant profits, which is a huge mistake." The capitalists of Qingfeng, Wanhe, Zhonghua and other dyeing and weaving factories also reviewed their mistakes such as hoarding yarn and illegal operations, and realized that their idea of not striving to improve operations but instead seeking exorbitant profits was against the interests of the broad masses of the people. Some industries also conducted inspections and voluntarily reduced the prices of some goods that were too high.

Following the "Anti-Profiteering" and "Anti-Speculation" education conference, the Suzhou industrial and commercial circles held an "Anti-Tax Evasion" education conference on November 29th, attended by more than 3,700 industrialists and businessmen. The meeting exposed several typical examples of tax evasion. For example, Shuntai Cigarette Factory set up three basements to make false accounts; Dajiangnan Cigarette Factory evaded taxes of 221 million yuan; Fan Shoubao of Changfeng Fresh Fruit Shop evaded taxes three times and beat up tax bureau investigators. The attendees spoke one after another, unanimously demanding that the government severely punish lawbreakers and expressing that they would carry out mutual inspection and account establishment movements after the meeting. Representatives of the city's store employee union stated at the meeting that employees would actively carry out a tax protection movement and wage an irreconcilable struggle against tax evasion.

In order to enable the self-transformation movement of the industrial and commercial circles to be effective, various industries are now holding meetings respectively, focusing on opposing profiteering ideas, eliminating malpractices, improving operations, and serving the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, to revise patriotic covenants. Many industries have also signed letters of determination, guaranteeing to revise the patriotic covenant, operate in a planned manner, establish a regular inspection system, and make political study and business study regular, and to implement patriotic thinking into actual business.

### 苏州市工商界开展自我教育运动

    苏州市工商界开展自我教育运动
    随着全国财政经济情况的好转，苏州市的工商界和全国工商界一样，已经逐渐得到发展。全市工商户数，今年已较一九四九年增加百分之五十三。一向是淡季的夏季，今年也变为旺季了：今年夏季的营业额比春季增加了百分之一百零六；比去年夏季则增加了百分之八十二。全市工商界的爱国热情也有了很大提高。许多工商户已开始面向农村，改善了经营，并踊跃交纳国税。为了支援人民志愿军，全市工商界超额完成了捐献战斗机十三架的计划。
    但是，必须指出，苏州市部分工商业者，随着业务的好转，产生了一种脱离国家经济领导的偏向，如追逐暴利，降低商品质量，不遵守合同协议。还有不少工商业者偷漏国税，损害国家的利益。为了纠正这些错误的思想行为，迎接工商业的进一步好转，苏州市在十一月五日至十二月二日举行了私营企业生产经营改造展览会。展览会的目的是：暴露过去经营的陋规，介绍两年来经营的成绩，指出今后生产、经营的方向。全市一百三十多个行业都参加了展览会。展览出图表、模型、实物四千三百多件。其中许多展览品揭露了过去工商业者谋取暴利的方法，如偷工减料，掺假冒牌，使用非法度量衡等。在展出的二十八天中，参观者共有十万人，并有外地的许多团体赶来参观。
    在展览会的筹备和展览期间，各行各业纷纷举行专业会议或座谈会，酝酿讨论怎样革除陋规、改进生产、改善经营。工商联和展览会的生产辅导处，并组织了工作队，配合各行业同业公会，在各行业中进行调查研究，并协助召开专业会议，拟订明年生产计划或业务计划，以逐步开始有计划的经营。
    十一月十四日，苏州市工商联又召集各行业代表四百余人，举行了“反暴利”“反投机”教育大会。会上揭露了某些工商业者不求自己改造，甚至不遵守政府法令，进行投机，谋取暴利的行为。会上有三户曾经进行投机和高抬物价的工商业者作了自我检讨。会后，各行业即普遍组织了传达和讨论。有的工商业者在讨论中进行了批评与自我批评。如协成染织厂资方检讨说：“在替国营公司加工代织的情况下，我们的营业才走上了好转；最近我们的资金发生困难，国营公司又收购了四百多匹被单布，解决了我们的困难。可是我们没有感谢政府，反而在旺季中想抬高工缴，谋取暴利，实在是一个绝大错误。”庆丰、万和、中华等染织厂的资方也检讨了囤纱和非法经营等错误，认识到自己不在改善经营上努力，而在谋取暴利上打主意的思想是违反广大人民利益的。有的行业并进行了检查，自动将某些售价太高的货品降低了价格。
    继举行“反暴利”“反投机”教育大会之后，苏州市工商界又在十一月二十九日举行了“反逃税”教育大会，到会的有工商业者三千七百多人。会上揭露了几个逃税的典型例子。如顺泰烟厂设置三个地下室造假账；大江南烟厂逃税两亿二千一百多万元；长丰鲜果号的范寿宝三次逃税，并殴伤税局查税工作人员等。到会人纷纷发言，一致要求政府严办不法分子，并表示会后要开展相互检查和建账建证的运动。市店员工会代表在会上表示店员们将积极开展护税运动，向逃税现象作不调和的斗争。
    为了使工商界的自我改造运动能深入收效，各行各业现正分别召开会议，以反对暴利思想、革除陋规、改善经营、为城乡物资交流服务等为中心内容，修订爱国公约。许多行业并签订了决心书，保证修订好爱国公约，有计划地经营，建立经常的检查制度，并且要把政治学习和业务学习做到经常化，把爱国思想贯彻到实际业务中去。（高）
