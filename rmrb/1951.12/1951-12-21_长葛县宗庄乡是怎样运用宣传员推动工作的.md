How Zongzhuang Township in Changge County Uses Propagandists to Promote Work
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Qu Fangming
    The work in Zongzhuang Township, Changge County, Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, has taken on a new look since the establishment of propagandists. Propagandists are an indispensable force for completing any task here. The township and village cadres of Zongzhuang Township have learned from experience: "Coercive methods don't work; we must build a good propaganda network." They have made the propagandists' work of propaganda a prerequisite for carrying out all tasks.
    Recently, we visited Zongzhuang Township's mobilization of Huai River harnessing corvée laborers. The important role of propagandists is particularly evident in this mobilization.
    On October 19th, the township head and township instructor (Party branch secretary) of Zongzhuang Township returned from the county with the task of mobilizing corvée laborers to harness the Huai River. The farmers of this township had never suffered from the Huai River's disasters before. Now, they had to mobilize them to work for half a year in a place one or two hundred li away. For the township cadres, this was not an easy task. The instructor said: "The county has repeatedly emphasized that the task must be completed, but coercive orders must not be given." What should be done? The instructor decided: "Hold an expanded cadre meeting, and let all departments launch propaganda first." Launching propaganda is their fundamental method of completing tasks.
    All thirty-one propagandists in the township attended the township's expanded cadre meeting. At this meeting, the township cadres did not first assign the quota for mobilizing corvée laborers. Instead, the central topic was how to launch a township-wide propaganda campaign. After the township head and instructor reported on the significance of harnessing the Huai River and the methods of mobilizing corvée laborers, the various departments (village chiefs, Communist Youth League, Women's Federation, militia, propagandists, etc.) dispersed and discussed separately. The instructor personally participated in the propagandists' discussion, and the propagandists had a heated discussion on how to carry out the Huai River harnessing propaganda. Each propagandist spoke about the content that should be publicized, and if what they said was incorrect, everyone corrected them.
    Afterwards, the Party's district committee secretary personally convened and chaired a representative meeting of propagandists from the entire district to deploy the propaganda work for mobilizing corvée laborers to harness the Huai River. This further strengthened the activities of the propagandists.
    After the meeting, the propaganda campaign unfolded. In various departments, at "pianhui" [Note], propagandists were conducting oral propaganda everywhere—this was their main method of activity. In addition, propagandists also used radio stations and other propaganda tools. The entire village was resounding with the voice of Huai River harnessing. The propagandists were very enthusiastic, and everyone felt that their responsibility was glorious. Therefore, they were creative in the methods and content of propaganda. At one "pianhui," some elderly people initially showed no response to the propagandists' propaganda. One propagandist patiently enlightened them by recalling their past lives, talking about the benefits of land reform and the advantages of responding to the people's government's call to plant tobacco... Although the Huai River is far from them, everyone will slowly see the benefits of harnessing the Huai River. He said, "When has Chairman Mao's word ever failed?" As a result, the elderly also nodded in agreement.
    In terms of the ideological nature of the propaganda, generally speaking, it existed, that is, combining the personal interests of harnessing the Huai River with the interests of the country. One propagandist said: "If the Huai River is repaired, electricity can be generated, more factories can be opened, and more machines can be made; if water is drawn to irrigate the land, more grain can be harvested. In this way, the realization of socialism will be faster." Another propagandist said: "We can't say that we shouldn't repair the Huai River just because the Huai River doesn't flood us. All farmers in the world are one family. If a neighbor has a disaster, they should be rescued. The Soviet Union is helping to repair the Huai River. Does the Huai River flood the Soviet Union?" There was also some propaganda that was incorrect, such as one-sidedly promoting: "Three catties and four taels of rice a day, and if you work harder, you can even save some to bring back. Who wouldn't do such a good thing!"
    As a result, after less than two days of propaganda, more than 500 people in the township voluntarily signed up to harness the Huai River, greatly exceeding Zongzhuang Township's original plan. Chairman Mao's great call: "We must repair the Huai River" has become a household name here through the Party's leadership and the active activities of the propagandists, and has thus become a real force.
    In general, the political atmosphere in Zongzhuang Township is very strong. The masses urgently demand to study culture and politics. The entire township subscribes to 128 newspapers, averaging one newspaper for every four to five households. The masses spontaneously organized a theater troupe, and hundreds and thousands of spectators ran to see their performances. Why do the masses have such high political enthusiasm? According to the Party branch secretary, in addition to the fact that the masses have turned themselves over after the land reform and their lives have become prosperous, the propaganda activities of the propagandists are an important reason. He said: "Since our township has had propagandists, all work has been energized and is more lively than before."
    The propagandists of Zongzhuang Township can play a role mainly because the Party branch secretary and the higher-level Party committee attach importance to regular leadership. The Party branch secretary is one of only two Party members in the township and is very busy, but he can still personally lead the propagandists because he has realized that this is a powerful force for promoting work. He regularly holds a meeting of propagandist group leaders every five days, or a meeting of all propagandists every seven to ten days, to check and deploy the work of the propagandists. The Party branch secretary pays great attention to leading and using the power of the Communist Youth League, because 19 of the 31 propagandists in the township are members of the Communist Youth League. Every time the Party branch secretary convenes a meeting of propagandists, he must let the secretary of the League branch participate. The Party's district and county committees have also done some work in the cultivation and improvement of propagandists. They have used the following methods to cultivate propagandists: (1) Propagandist representative meeting; (2) Propagandist training class; (3) Transmission station; (4) Representatives of propagandists participate in cadre meetings to deploy central tasks.
   [Note] "Pianhui" is a form of chat where farmers who live close to each other spontaneously gather on the streets after dinner.

　　长葛县宗庄乡是怎样运用宣传员推动工作的
         曲方明
    河南许昌专区长葛县宗庄乡的工作，由于建立了宣传员，已经面貌一新。宣传员在这里是完成任何工作的不可缺少的力量。宗庄乡的乡村干部从经验中体会了：“强迫命令的办法吃不开，非把宣传网弄好不行。”他们已把宣传员的宣传工作当做进行一切工作的先决条件。
    最近我们参观了宗庄乡动员治淮民工的情形，从这次动员工作中，宣传员的重要作用可以看得特别明显。
    十月十九日，宗庄乡的乡长、乡指导员（党支部书记）等带着动员治淮民工的任务从县里回来了。这乡的农民从来没有受过淮水的灾害，如今要动员他们到一二百里远的地方去劳动半年，对于乡干部说，这不是一个轻易的任务。指导员说：“县里一再强调，任务要完成，但决不能强迫命令。”怎么办呢？指导员这样决定：“开扩大干部会，各部门先展开宣传。”展开宣传，这就是他们完成任务的根本方法。
    全乡三十一个宣传员都参加了乡的扩大干部会。在这次会上，乡干部并没有首先分配动员民工的名额，而中心议题是如何展开一个全乡的宣传运动。在乡长、指导员报告了治淮的意义和动员民工的方法以后，各部门（村长、青年团、妇联、民兵、宣传员等）就散开分头讨论。指导员亲自参加了宣传员的讨论会，宣传员在会上对如何进行治淮宣传问题展开了热烈的讨论，每个宣传员都说了一遍应宣传的内容，说得不对的，就由大家矫正。
    以后，党的区委书记又亲自召集和主持了全区的宣传员代表会，布置动员治淮民工的宣传工作。这样，更加强了宣传员的活动。
    会后，宣传活动展开了。在各部门，在片会〔注〕上，到处都有宣传员在进行口头宣传——这是他们活动的主要方式。另外，宣传员还运用了广播台等各种宣传工具。每个村里都响动着一片治淮声。宣传员的积极性是很高的，每个人都觉得他责任的光荣。因此，他们在宣传的方式和内容上就富有创造性。在一次片会上，开始有些老年人对宣传员的宣传毫无反应。一个宣传员就苦口婆心地启发他们回忆以往的生活，讲到土地改革翻身，讲到响应人民政府号召种烟叶的好处，……淮河虽然离他们远，慢慢地大家就会看到治淮的好处。他说：“毛主席的话多会落过空？”结果，老年人也点起头来了。
    在宣传的思想性方面，一般说来是有的，那就是把治淮的切身利益和国家利益相结合。一个宣传员这样讲：“修好了淮河，可以磨电，多开工厂，多造机器；引出水来浇地，可以多打粮食。这样，实行社会主义就快了。”另一个宣传员说：“不能说淮河淹不着俺，俺就不去修。天下农民是一家，邻家有了灾难，就应当去救。苏联帮着修淮河，难道淮河会淹着人家苏联？”也有少数宣传是错误的，如片面地宣传：“一天三斤四两米，多干还可以剩了带回来，这种好事谁不干！”
    结果，经过不到两天的宣传，全乡自动报名治淮的达到五百多人，大大地超过了宗庄乡的原订计划。毛主席的伟大号召：“一定要把淮河修好”，在这里由于党的领导通过宣传员的积极活动，做到了家喻户晓，因而变成了真正的力量。
    总的说来，宗庄乡的政治空气是很浓厚的。群众迫切地要求学习文化、政治。全乡订报一百二十八份，平均四——五户就有一份报纸。群众自动地组织了剧团，成百上千的观众跑来看它们的演出。为什么群众具有这样高的政治热情呢？据党的支部书记说，除土地改革后，群众翻了身，群众生活已走向富裕以外，宣传员的宣传活动是一个重要原因。他说：“俺乡自从有了宣传员，一切工作都有了劲，比以前活的多了。”
    宗庄乡的宣传员能起作用，主要地是因为党支部书记和上级党委重视了经常的领导。党支部书记是现在该乡仅有的两个党员中的一个，工作是很忙的，但是他仍然能够亲自领导宣传员，因为他已经认识到这是推动工作的一支有力队伍。他经常地每五天要召开一次宣传员小组长会，或者七至十天召集一次宣传员全体会，检查和布置宣传员的工作。党支部书记很注意领导和运用青年团这一力量，因为在全乡三十一名宣传员中，十九名是青年团员。每次党支部书记召集宣传员会议时，必让团的支部书记来参加。党的区委和县委在宣传员的培养和提高方面也做了一些工作，它们曾用以下几种方法去培养宣传员：（一）宣传员代表会；（二）宣传员训练班；（三）传授站；（四）宣传员的代表参加布置中心工作的干部会。
      〔注〕片会是住得近的农民于晚饭后自行集合街头的一种谈天形式。
