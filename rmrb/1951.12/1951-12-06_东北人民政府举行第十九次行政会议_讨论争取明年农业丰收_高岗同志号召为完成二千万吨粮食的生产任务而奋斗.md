    Northeast People's Government Holds 19th Administrative Meeting to Discuss Striving for Agricultural Bumper Harvest Next Year
    Comrade Gao Gang Calls for Striving to Complete the Production Task of 20 Million Tons of Grain
   [Reported by this newspaper] The Northeast People's Government convened its 19th administrative meeting on the morning of November 24 to discuss agricultural production issues for 1952. Attending the meeting were Chairman Gao Gang, Vice Chairman Lin Feng, Vice Chairman Gao Chongmin, government committee members in Shenyang, and responsible cadres from various departments at the Northeast level, totaling 52 people. After listening to a brief report by Vice Minister Wei Zhenwu of the Agricultural Department of the Northeast People's Government on the guidelines and tasks of agricultural production for 1952, the meeting unanimously adopted the Northeast People's Government's guidelines and tasks for agricultural production in 1952.
    Chairman Gao Gang pointed out in his summary that next year's agricultural production should strive to complete the production task of 20 million tons of grain. In normal years, only exceeding the target is permitted, and lowering it is not.
    Chairman Gao Gang then pointed out that in order to complete next year's agricultural production tasks, the primary task is to organize and leverage the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of farmers in the Northeast, and strive to organize cooperation and mutual assistance. All rural work cadres should take improving agricultural production, organizing cooperation and mutual assistance, and leading farmers to produce more grain, harvest more cotton, and increase other income as the center of their work. It is necessary to patiently and actively conduct long-term education among farmers on cooperation and mutual assistance, agricultural tool reform, agricultural technology, and increasing yields. Through practical education in the labor production process and systematic political education, farmers' scientific and technological knowledge and political awareness will gradually improve, their production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm will definitely greatly increase, and agricultural production will improve year by year.
    Regarding increasing yields per unit area, Chairman Gao Gang said: We must strive to accumulate and apply fertilizer, promote improved varieties, promote new agricultural tools, and implement deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. All people in rural areas who can participate in labor, especially the vast female labor force, should be mobilized to the agricultural production front to strive for a bumper harvest.
    Regarding state-owned farms, Chairman Gao Gang said: These are socialist in nature and should be developed steadily. We must train cadres, accumulate experience, conscientiously implement the economic accounting system, maximize the efficiency of equipment, and effectively increase yields to serve as a demonstration for farmers. Regarding the training of agricultural cadres, Chairman Gao Gang said: First of all, the district and village production committee members, production assistants, labor models, and mutual aid team leaders in rural areas should be educated this winter to exchange production experiences. They are the largest group of cadres in agricultural production; the Ministry of Agriculture should urge all provinces and counties to improve them. In addition, agricultural colleges should be run well; each province should run specialized agricultural technical schools well.
    Finally, Chairman Gao Gang spoke about the issue of formulating agricultural production plans. He said: When formulating plans, we must see the present and also see the future prospects. We must formulate plans for undertakings directly organized by the government and production plans completed by mobilizing farmers, and closely integrate these two types of plans. The plan must be realistic and pragmatic. Once it is formulated, people's governments at all levels should organize forces to actively implement it and overcome and prevent laissez-faire phenomena. In order to effectively implement the plan, attention should be paid to strict inspection. Agricultural leading organs must send people to rural areas, production groups, and farmers' households to inspect, and leading cadres must go to the organs they lead to inspect the most specific measures, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner, and provide timely updates, opposing the bureaucratic style of touring superficially or sitting in the office circulating official documents.

    东北人民政府举行第十九次行政会议
    讨论争取明年农业丰收
    高岗同志号召为完成二千万吨粮食的生产任务而奋斗
   【本报讯】东北人民政府于十一月二十四日上午召开第十九次行政会议，讨论一九五二年农业生产问题。出席会议的有高岗主席、林枫副主席、高崇民副主席、在沈阳市的政府委员及东北一级各部门负责干部共五十二人。会议在听取东北人民政府农业部魏震五副部长对一九五二年农业生产的方针和任务的简要报告后，经过讨论一致通过了东北人民政府关于一九五二年度农业生产的方针和任务。
    高岗主席在总结中首先指出：明年农业生产要为完成二千万吨粮食的生产任务而奋斗。在正常年景，只准超过，不准降低。
    高岗主席接着指出：为了完成明年的农业生产任务，首要的是组织与发挥全东北广大农民的积极性和创造性，努力组织合作互助；所有农村工作的干部都应把提高农业生产、组织合作互助、领导农民多打粮食、多收棉花、增加其他收入当做自己工作的中心。必须耐心地积极地向农民进行长期的合作互助的教育、农具改革的教育、农业技术的教育和提高产量的教育。经过劳动生产过程的实际教育，和有系统的政治教育，农民的科学技术知识和政治觉悟就会逐渐提高，生产积极性和政治积极性一定会大大高涨，农业生产就会逐年提高。
    关于提高单位面积产量，高岗主席说：必须努力积肥施肥，推广优良品种，推广新式农具并实行深耕细作。要把农村所有可以参加劳动的一切人们，特别是广大的妇女劳动力，都动员到农业生产战线上去，争取农业丰收。
    关于国营农场，高岗主席说：这是社会主义性质的，要稳步发展，要培养干部、积累经验并认真地贯彻经济核算制，发挥设备的效率，把产量切实提高，向农民示范。关于培养农业干部，高岗主席说：首先应该把农村的区、村生产委员、生产助理员、劳动模范、互助组长在今年冬天加以教育，交流生产经验。他们是农业生产中最广大的干部；农业部要督促各省、县把他们加以提高。此外，还要把农学院办好；各省应把农业专门技术学校办好。
    最后高岗主席说到制订农业生产计划问题。他说：在制订计划的时候，要看到现在，又要看到将来的远景，要订出政府直接举办的事业计划和动员农民完成的生产计划，并把这两种计划相互密切结合起来。计划必须是实事求是的，一经订好，各级人民政府应组织力量积极贯彻，克服和防止自流现象。为了有效地贯彻计划，应注意严格检查，农业领导机关一定要派人到农村，到生产小组，到农户去检查，领导干部要到被领导的机关去检查，检查最具体的措施，发现问题，及时解决，及时通报，反对那种走马观花或坐在办公室周转公文的官僚主义作风。（东北日报）
