The Jiangxi Provincial Grain Bureau recently convened a provincial rice milling conference to study the improvement of the rice yield rate for contracted rice processing. The achievement of the conference was an increase in the rice yield rate from the original 60 to 63 jin of three-grade milled rice per 100 jin of paddy, to 68 to 69 jin.

After the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign was launched in Jiangxi, the Grain Bureau mobilized all employees to find methods and study ways to increase production and conserve resources. Everyone unanimously agreed that if the current rice yield rate of contracted rice processing could be improved, a significant amount of wealth could be added to the country. The Grain Bureau then conducted experiments in its own rice milling factories. The results showed that 71 to 72 jin of three-grade milled rice could be produced from every 100 jin of paddy. The original contracted rice yield rate was too low, and the state suffered significant losses. The Grain Bureau reviewed the reasons why the state had suffered significant losses in the past during contracted processing, citing two reasons: First, the grain administrative departments did not understand the processing business, and some private processing mills had a profiteering mentality, resulting in too low a contracted rice yield rate. Second, public processing factories were poorly managed, and cost estimates were too high.

The fact that the rice yield rate was too low immediately drew the attention of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Financial and Economic Committee. The Provincial People's Government immediately instructed the Grain Bureau and all public and private rice mills to study methods to improve the rice yield rate of paddy processing. The Grain Bureau first invited the heads of public and private rice mills in Nanchang, Ji'an, Shangrao, Linchuan, and other places for discussions, and then convened a provincial rice milling conference.

In order to convince the public and private rice mills with facts, the Grain Bureau conducted rice milling experiments at the provincial rice milling conference. The experimental results showed that even the most backward rice milling machines could produce 70 jin and 14 liang of better-quality three-grade milled rice per 100 jin of paddy, and it was proven that the amount of wood charcoal or fuel oil consumed for milling 100 jin of paddy was less than the amount reported by each factory in the past. The Grain Bureau also cited the operational situation of the Demin Processing Rice Mill in Ji'an as an example, explaining that the daily income from coarse bran, fine bran, and broken rice of the factory offset all expenses such as machine depreciation, wages, taxes, management fees, etc., and there was still a surplus. It called on all factories to improve their operations, with small profits and high volume. The Grain Bureau also criticized the public rice mills' thinking of simply completing tasks and not seeking to improve management and reduce costs, as well as the profiteering mentality of some private rice mills. After discussions, all public and private rice mills expressed their willingness, in the spirit of patriotism, to respond to the call to increase production and practice economy, implement small profits and high volume, and volunteered to increase the rice yield rate to 68 jin without reducing quality, and some even volunteered to deliver 69 jin.

In order to lead the way for public rice mills and further improve rice milling quality and rice yield rate, Jiangxi Province will implement unified management of public rice mills.

    江西省粮食局召开全省食米加工会议
    研究提高委托加工稻谷交米率成功
    批评了公营米厂的单纯任务观点和私营米厂的暴利思想
    江西省人民政府粮食局最近曾召开全省食米加工会议，研究提高委托加工稻谷的交米率。会议的成就是：交米率已由原来每百斤稻谷交三道机米六十斤到六十三斤，提高到了六十八斤到六十九斤。
    增产节约运动在江西展开以后，粮食局就发动全体员工找窍门，研究增产节约的办法。大家一致认为：如果能把现在委托加工稻谷的交米率提高，就可给国家增加一笔很大的财富。粮食局随即在自办的食米加工工厂试验，试验结果证明，每百斤稻谷可碾出三道机米七十一斤到七十二斤，原定委托加工的交米率太低，国家遭受的损失太大。粮食局检讨过去在委托加工中使国家遭受重大损失的原因有两个：一、粮食行政部门不懂加工业务，部分私营加工米厂有暴利思想，以致合同规定的交米率太低；二、公营加工工厂管理不善，成本估计过高。
    交米率太低的事实，立即引起了江西省人民政府财政经济委员会的重视。省人民政府当即责成粮食局和各公私米厂研究提高稻谷加工交米率的办法。粮食局首先分别在南昌、吉安、上饶、临川等地邀请公私米厂负责人座谈，随即召开了全省食米加工会议。
    为了用事实说服公私米厂，粮食局在全省食米加工会议上曾试验碾米。试验结果，最落后的碾米机，每百斤稻谷也可出质量更好的三道机米七十斤零十四两，而且证明每碾一百斤稻谷所耗的木炭或油料，都比过去各厂所报的数量小。粮食局并举出吉安德民加工米厂的经营情况为例，说明该厂每天的粗糠、细糠和碎米的收入，抵销机器折旧、工资、税金、管理费等等一切开支，还有盈余，号召各厂改进业务，薄利多产。粮食局在会上并批评了公营米厂的单纯完成任务、不求改善经营降低成本的思想，也批评了一些私营米厂的暴利思想。各公私米厂在讨论后，都表示愿在爱国主义的精神下，响应增产节约的号召，实行薄利多产，纷纷自报愿在不降低质量的条件下，把交米率提高到六十八斤，有的还愿交六十九斤。
    为使公营米厂带头，进一步提高碾米质量和出米率，江西省将实行对公营米厂的统一管理。
