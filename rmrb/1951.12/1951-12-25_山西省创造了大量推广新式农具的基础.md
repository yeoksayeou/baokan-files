    Shanxi Province Creates a Solid Foundation for Promoting New Agricultural Implements
     By our special correspondent Wu Guangtang
    Shanxi has achieved remarkable results in promoting new agricultural implements, mainly walking plows, over the past year. Farmers have personally experienced that switching to new agricultural implements can indeed improve farming efficiency and increase yields. Farmers spontaneously improving and creating agricultural implements is also widespread. In the spring and summer of 1950, there were more than twenty kinds of agricultural implements successfully modified by the farmers themselves. Liu Jubao's "hollow hoe" and Wang Denggao's "weeding hoe" in Lucheng, and Cui Rongzhang's "Huo lou hoe" in Xiangyuan, are all welcomed by the local people. This reflects the farmers' aspirations after the completion of land reform and the restoration of production. The promotion of new agricultural implements in Shanxi Province started on this basis.
    In the past year, a total of 10,053 new agricultural implements (7-inch walking plow, 5-inch walking plow, 166 clay plow, large and small corn threshers, rice threshers, weeding hoes, chaff cutters, machine grinders, slicers, etc.) have been promoted (not including those promoted in 1950), of which plows account for more than 60%. In addition, more than 15,000 sprayers have been promoted. The province's and prefecture's farms have begun to experiment with animal-powered harrows, horse-drawn harvesters, and ten-row seeders. The experience of the past year proves that the improvement of plows is an important sign of the improvement of agricultural productivity. The new walking plow is indeed "stable to pull, good at turning the soil, deep to plow, and quick to plow," and is most popular among the masses. The area of land cultivated with new walking plows in Shanxi Province has gradually increased over the past year, from about 70,000 mu in spring to 200,000 mu in summer and 338,000 mu in autumn.
    In addition, corn threshers and sprayers are also popular among the masses. The efficiency of a small corn thresher is equivalent to that of three people, while a large one can be equivalent to five people. The pest control effect of sprayers is even better than that of manual labor. According to a survey in the eighth and ninth districts of Guoxian County, three people using a short-tube sprayer can spray 30 to 60 mu of fruit trees a day, which is ten times more efficient than manual prevention by three people. According to statistics from 47 villages in these two districts, a total of 46,550 fruit trees were sprayed, saving 126,125 yuan in labor costs per tree. Using a sprayer to control cotton aphids is also four to five times more efficient than manual labor. Because new agricultural implements have shown remarkable effects, they are generally in short supply. This spring, the masses went to the Changzhi Prefectural Agricultural Implement Station to buy agricultural implements in a continuous stream. Xiangyuan sent vehicles six times, but still did not transport the agricultural implements back. The number of orders from villages and counties often exceeded two or three times the number of stations in stock. Vehicles transporting new agricultural implements were often intercepted by the masses along the way, requesting them to be given to them; some agricultural implements had not yet been unloaded, and the masses put their names on them. Farmers love new agricultural implements so much.
    The number of new agricultural implements promoted in Shanxi Province is not large, but it has spread to all counties in the province (from 700 in the most to 3 in the least). This is of great help to the demonstration and education and technical instruction of new agricultural implements, and creates favorable conditions for large-scale promotion in the future. The experience of promoting new agricultural implements in the past year proves that in addition to the importance of leading cadres and sufficient support from the state, the following points should be mainly grasped:
    First, we must attach importance to publicizing the superiority of new agricultural implements, organizing typical demonstrations, comparative experiments, and breaking the masses' conservative ideas and some concerns. Lingchuan, Fenyang and other key counties for promotion have combined the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to educate the superiority of new agricultural implements. Yangqu, Guoxian, Xiyang and other key counties used the Spring Festival and temple fairs to hold small agricultural implement exhibitions. The Xiangling, Yongji, and Linxian cultural centers have permanent exhibition rooms for new agricultural implements, and there are special personnel responsible for imparting the use of technology. According to incomplete statistics, more than 500,000 people in the province have visited new agricultural implements at various exhibitions and observation meetings. The agricultural implement promotion station also plans to select special demonstration households for comparative experiments. After conducting a comparative experiment of new and old plows in Quwen Village, Anyi, it organized labor models and the masses from nearby Yuetan, Fengcun, Xiliu, Daqu, Yuanwangzhuang and other villages to visit and evaluate, proving that under the same farming conditions, the cotton seedlings in the land plowed with the new plow were taller and had more cotton bolls than the cotton seedlings in the land plowed with the old plow. There are also many other places where the masses conduct their own comparative experiments. These experiments broke the conservative thinking of the masses and made them realize the superiority of new agricultural implements. The masses in Lingchuan County sang praises of the new walking plow: "New society, new atmosphere, new plow turns up new soil; changed appearance, more grain, guaranteed resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea." Through the publicity and education of new agricultural implements, farmers have further realized the close relationship between workers and peasants. Lian Quanbao wrote a letter to the workers saying: "If it were not for the worker brothers manufacturing new agricultural implements, we would not be able to increase production. I hope you will produce more new agricultural implements to support us in producing more industrial raw materials." They have begun to realize the great significance of the worker-peasant alliance from their actual lives.
    Second, we must do a good job in imparting technology at the same time during promotion. In 1950, when Shanxi began to promote new agricultural implements, there was a phenomenon of decoupling between promotion and technical instruction. Therefore, this year, the agricultural leading organs at all levels in Shanxi Province particularly emphasized technical training and technical instruction. This spring, the province, prefectures, and counties trained more than 4,000 agricultural implement professional and technical cadres and labor model activists who mastered the technology of using new agricultural implements. Many cadres have become technical instructors in the use of new agricultural implements. More than 100 county and district cadres in Qinxian, Xiangyuan, Changzhi, Jincheng, and Lingchuan counties have learned the technology of using new agricultural implements. In the county and district spring agricultural technology training, the technology of using new agricultural implements is also listed as one of the main courses. After classroom lectures and field practice, 20,000 people have learned to use the new plow. During summer and autumn cultivation, short-term professional training was also conducted in key promotion areas. The Xin County Prefecture trained 48,757 people in nine counties. Some agricultural implement stations put forward the slogan "Technology does not go to the countryside, agricultural implements do not leave the door" to ensure that technology and agricultural implements are delivered to the masses at the same time. Lingchuan and other counties specially lectured on the use of agricultural implement technology and performed practical demonstrations at expanded cadre meetings in districts and villages. Some areas have also organized technical instruction stations. This year, because we have attached importance to technical education and technical instruction, the promotion of agricultural implements has been relatively smooth, and the use effect has been better.
    Third, it should be recognized that rural labor mutual aid groups are the main targets for the promotion of new agricultural implements. At present, 80% of the new agricultural implements that have been promoted are in the hands of mutual aid groups. According to statistics before August this year, more than 1,500 mutual aid groups in Fenyang, Licheng, Wuxiang, Pingshun, Dingxiang and other counties have jointly purchased new agricultural implements. All 417 agricultural implements in Lingchuan County were lent to mutual aid groups. Mutual aid groups are indeed a good foundation for the use of new agricultural implements; at the same time, new agricultural implements have also promoted the development and consolidation of mutual aid groups. The Ren Zhengchun mutual aid group in Pangjiachuan, Lingchuan, has developed from eight households to nineteen households because it bought new agricultural implements. The whole village of Hua? Village, with 15 households, has joined the mutual aid group because it bought a new walking plow. Gao Village in Dingxiang bought 14 new walking plows and organized 14 mutual aid groups based on the walking plows. At present, the new agricultural implements promoted are generally suitable for small-scale peasant economy; but they must be combined with organization to give full play to the effectiveness of new agricultural implements. Some people reflect: "New agricultural implements are good, but they can't afford to buy them and don't need them." This precisely illustrates the problem. For example, a small corn thresher can thresh 480 catties of corn per day (8 hours), while a large one can thresh 2,000 catties. If a farmer buys a small corn thresher alone, it only takes a few days to thresh all the corn in the family, and then it will not be needed again for a year. If it is a mutual aid group, the situation is completely different, it can be used and can afford to buy it. The same is true for other agricultural implements such as chaff cutters, precision selectors, weeding hoes, and sprayers. At the same time, there are many types of new agricultural implements, and they all require certain use technology. Organizing together can divide the work to learn and overcome the difficulty that one person cannot learn everything.
    Fourth, it is necessary to establish professional agricultural implement promotion agencies to combine the administrative leadership, technical instruction, and business promotion of agricultural implement work. Shanxi established the Provincial Agricultural Implement Promotion Station and five prefectural promotion stations in 1950, and added two prefectural stations and six key county stations in 1951. In addition, five agricultural implement repair and distribution stations were set up. This played a decisive role in the development of the promotion of new agricultural implements. Huguan, Licheng and other counties have also organized agricultural implement promotion committees headed by the county magistrate, which has more directly promoted the promotion of agricultural implements. The promotion of new agricultural implements requires strong administrative cooperation and specialized technical guidance, as well as more complex business work, such as the ordering, transportation, sales, lending, charging, and how to repair and distribute agricultural implements. Without specialized agencies, the promotion work will be restricted. In the past, some areas did not attach importance to the organization of professional agencies, which not only made the promotion work difficult, but also made the business very chaotic. Agricultural implement repair and distribution must also have a specialized organization. Farmers have a very urgent need for this. Farmers in Changzhi and other places asked cadres to go to the countryside with tools to repair agricultural implements and adjust and repair them for them. We should provide installation, repair and distribution, and use guarantee for new agricultural implements. The existing repair and distribution stations still cannot keep up with the needs of the masses.
    Fifth, solving the manufacturing problem of new agricultural implements is also an important part of promoting new agricultural implements. Initially, we did not pay enough attention to agricultural implement manufacturing. The agricultural implements produced in various places had extremely inconsistent specifications and poor quality, which made the promotion work difficult. Therefore, this year, a provincial agricultural implement manufacturing meeting of 65 public and private machinery and iron factories was specially convened to implement the spirit of "organizing and giving full play to the potential power of the machinery industry," and initially solved the problems of unified planning, unified distribution of manufacturing tasks, unified agricultural implement specifications, and unified prices in agricultural implement manufacturing. This not only guaranteed agricultural implement manufacturing, but also unified the specifications of agricultural implement manufacturing throughout the province. This greatly facilitated farmers to repair and distribute agricultural implement parts. Shanxi Machinery Company also automatically took on the task of organizing various factories to unify the purchase of materials, helping various factories solve drawings, models, and train technical workers, and regularly provided technical guidance to various factories to solve technical difficulties. This further increased the confidence of public and private factories in manufacturing new agricultural implements. At present, in addition to the Provincial Machinery Company being responsible for manufacturing agricultural implements, each prefecture has one or two specialized agricultural implement manufacturing factories of smaller scale. The leading organs appropriately and uniformly distributed tasks according to the professionalism and regionalism of each factory, so that each factory can gradually specialize (those who make plows specialize in making plows, and those who make waterwheels specialize in making waterwheels). In prefectures with inconvenient transportation such as Changzhi and Xingxian, the principle of local manufacturing and local promotion is adopted to reduce transportation costs and reduce costs. This is indeed a good start to solving the agricultural implement manufacturing problem in the province. If further improvements can be made in improving quality and reducing costs, the task of supplying agricultural implements throughout the province can be completed.
    The promotion of new agricultural implements in Shanxi has a considerable foundation; it is planned to promote 30,000 new agricultural implements on this basis in 1952. Now, we are stepping up preparations for the realization of this task.

    山西省创造了大量推广新式农具的基础
     本报特约记者    武光汤
    山西一年来推广以步犁为主的新式农具，已有显著成绩。农民们已亲身体验到，改用新式农具确实可以提高耕作效率，增加产量。农民自发地改进和创造农具的也很普遍。在一九五○年春夏两季，经过农民自己改造成功的农具就有二十多种。潞城刘聚宝的“空心锄”、王登高的“耘锄”，襄垣崔荣章的“霍耧锄”，都为当地群众所欢迎。这正反映了土地改革完成生产恢复以后农民的愿望。山西新式农具的推广工作，就是在这个基础上开展起来的。
    一年来推广新式农具（七寸步犁、五寸步犁、一六六黏土犁、大小型玉米脱粒机、打稻机、耘锄、铡草机、机器磨、切片机等）共一万零五十三部（一九五○年推广的没算在里边），其中犁占百分之六十以上。此外，并推广喷雾器一万五千多架。省的和专区的农场已开始试用畜力盖耙、马拉收割机和十行播种机等。一年来的经验证明，犁的改进是农业生产力提高的一个重要标志。新式步犁确实
    “拉得稳、翻土好、耕得深、犁得快”，最受群众欢迎。山西省一年来使用步犁耕地的面积已逐渐增加，春季用新式步犁耕地的面积约七万亩，夏季增加到二十万亩，秋季增加到三十三万八千亩。
    此外，玉米脱粒机、喷雾器也受群众欢迎。小型玉米脱粒机的效率可抵三个人工，大型的可以抵五个人工。喷雾器杀虫效果，更是人力比不上的。据崞县八九两区调查，三人合使短管喷雾器一架，每天可喷射果树三十亩到六十亩，比三人用手防治，提高效率十倍。又据这两个区四十七个村的统计，共喷射果树四万六千五百五十株，每株省工钱十二万六千一百二十五元。用喷雾器防治棉蚜也比手工提高效率四倍到五倍。因为新式农具已表现了显著的功效，所以普遍供不应求。今春群众到长治专区农具站购买农具的车马不断。襄垣连着派车六次，还没运回农具。各村各县订购数字常常超过站存数字的两倍三倍。运输新式农具的车辆，往往被群众沿路拦截，要求让给他们；有的农具还没卸车，群众就贴上自己的名字。农民对于新式农具是这样热爱。
    山西省推广新式农具的数量还不算多，但已遍布全省各县（每县多者七百部，少者三部），这对于新式农具的示范教育和技术传授有很大作用，给今后大量推广创造了有利条件。一年来推广新式农具的经验证明，除了领导干部必须重视及国家予以足够的支持外，主要应掌握以下几点：
    第一、必须重视对新式农具优越性的宣传，组织典型示范，对比试验，打破群众的保守思想和某些顾虑。陵川、汾阳等推广重点县，都结合抗美援朝运动，进行了新式农具的优越性的教育。阳曲、崞县、昔阳等重点县利用春节、庙会，举办了小型的农具展览会。襄陵、永济、临县文化馆设有新式农具的长期展览室，并有专人负责传授使用技术。据不完全统计，目前全省已有五十多万群众在各种展览会、观摩会参观了新式农具。农具推广站并且有计划地选择特约示范户，进行对比试验。安邑曲温村进行新旧犁对比试验后，并组织附近岳坛、冯村、西留、大渠、原王庄等村的劳动模范和群众前往参观评比，证明在同样耕作条件下，用新式犁耕的地的棉苗，比用旧式犁耕的地的棉苗长得高，棉桃多。其他各地群众，自己进行对比试验的也不少。这些试验，打破了群众的保守思想，使群众认识了新式农具的优越性。陵川县群众这样歌颂新式步犁：“新社会，新气象，新犁翻起新土壤；变了样，多打粮，抗美援朝有保障。”通过新式农具的宣传教育，使农民进一步认识了工农之间的密切关系。连全保写信给工人说：“如不是工人老大哥制造出新式农具，我们就增不了产。希望你们生产更多的新农具，支援我们生产更多的工业原料。”他们已开始从实际生活中体会了工农联盟的伟大意义。
    第二、在推广中同时必须做好技术传授工作。一九五○年山西开始推广新式农具时，发生过推广和技术传授脱节的现象。因此，今年山西各级农业领导机关特别强调了技术训练和技术传授。今年春季，省、专区、县曾训练了农具专业技术干部和掌握使用新农具技术的劳动模范积极分子四千余人。不少干部已成为使用新式农具的技术指导员。沁县、襄垣、长治、晋城、陵川五县有一百多个县区干部，学会了使用新式农具的技术。在县、区春季农业技术训练中，使用新式农具技术也列为主要课程之一。经过课堂讲授、田间实习，学会使用新犁的群众有两万人。夏耕和秋耕期间，重点推广区又做了短期专业训练，忻县专区九县训练了四万八千七百五十七人。有的农具站提出“技术不下乡，农具不出门”的口号，以保证把技术和农具同时交给群众。陵川等县在区村扩大干部会上，专门讲授农具使用技术，并做实习表演。有些地区还组织了技术传授站。今年我们因为重视了技术教育和技术传授，所以农具推广就比较顺利，使用效果也比较好。
    第三、应认清农村劳动互助组是新式农具推广的主要对象。目前已推广的新式农具，有百分之八十是互助组掌握的。据今年八月以前的统计：汾阳、黎城、武乡、平顺、定襄等县已有一千五百多个互助组合伙买了新式农具。陵川县四百一十七部农具全部贷给了互助组。互助组确实是使用新式农具的很好的基础；同时，新式农具也推动了互助组的发展和巩固。陵川庞家川任正春互助组，由于买到了新式农具，由八户发展到十九户。化?村由于买到新式步犁，全村十五户都参加了互助组。定襄高村买回新式步犁十四部，就以步犁做基础，组织了十四个互助组。目前推广的新式农具，一般是适合于小农经济的；但必须和组织起来相结合，才能更加发挥新式农具的效用。有些群众反映：“新式农具好，就是买不起，用不着。”正说明了这个问题。例如玉米脱粒机，小型的每天（八小时）可以脱玉米四百八十斤，大型的可脱二千斤。如果一个农户单独买一部小型玉米脱粒机，只需几天就可把一家的玉米全部脱完，以后在一年内就再用不着了。如果是一个互助组，情形就完全不同，可以用得着，而且也能够买得起。其他如铡草机、精选机、耘锄、喷雾器等，也大都如此。同时，新式农具种类繁多，而且都需要一定的使用技术，组织起来可以分工学习，克服一个人不能样样学会的困难。
    第四、要建立农具推广专业机构，使农具工作的行政领导、技术传授和经营推广结合起来。山西在
    一九五○年成立了省农具推广站和五个专区推广站，一九五一年又增设了两个专区站和六个重点县站。另外还设置了五个农具修配站。这对新式农具推广工作的开展，起了决定作用。壶关、黎城等县还组织了以县长为首的农具推广委员会，更直接推动了农具的推广工作。推广新式农具需要有行政的有力配合和专门技术的指导，同时也有较复杂的经营工作，如农具的订购、运销、出贷、收费以及如何修配等，如果没有专门机构，推广工作就会受到限制。过去有些地区没有重视组织专业机构，不但推广工作遭到困难，而且经营也很混乱。农具修配也必须有专门组织，农民对这一点的要求非常迫切。长治等地农民要求干部下乡带修农具的工具，给他们调整修配。我们对新农具应当是保安装、保修配、保使用。现有修配站，仍赶不上群众的需要。
    第五、解决新式农具的制造问题，也是推广新式农具的重要环节。最初我们对农具制造工作注意不够。各地制出的农具，规格极不一致，质量也较差，使推广工作遭到困难。因此，今年特地召开了全省六十五家公私机器业铁工厂的农具制造会议，贯彻“组织起来，充分发挥机械工业的潜在力量”的精神，初步地解决了农具制造中的统一计划、统一分配制造任务、统一农具规格、统一价格等问题。这不但使农具制造有了保证，而且统一了全省农具制造的规格。这给农民修配农具零件以极大的方便。山西省机器公司又自动地担任组织各厂统一购料、帮助各厂解决图纸、模型和训练技术工人等问题，并经常给各厂以技术指导，解决技术上的困难问题。这更增加了公私各厂制造新式农具的信心。目前全省除省机器公司负责制造农具外，各专区都有较小规模的专门制造农具的工厂一处或两处。领导机关根据各厂的专业性和地区性的原则，适当地统一分配了任务，使各厂能逐步专业化（做犁的专门做犁，做水车的专门做水车）。在交通不便的专区如长治、兴县专区，都是以就地制造、就地推广为原则，减少运费，降低成本。这对解决全省农具制造问题，确是一个良好的开端。如果能在提高质量、降低成本等方面更进一步地再加改进，就可以完成供给全省农具的任务。
    山西的新式农具推广工作已经有相当基础；一九五二年拟在这个基础上推广新式农具三万部。现在，正加紧为实现这个任务做各项准备工作。
