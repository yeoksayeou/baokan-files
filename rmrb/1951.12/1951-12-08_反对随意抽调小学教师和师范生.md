    Opposing the Arbitrary Transfer of Primary School Teachers and Normal School Students
    To the Editor: Currently, all regions feel that there is a shortage of primary school teachers, but some places are assigning normal school graduates to work in other positions. At Zhangjiakou Normal School in Chahar Province, less than twenty-five students from two graduating classes this year were assigned to educational work positions. This situation exists at Datong Normal School, Chaigoubu Normal School, and Zhangjiakou Women's Normal School. Students who are assigned to other administrative departments are mostly not content with their work and feel that what they have learned is not being used. In October of this year, Leting County, Hebei Province, established a "Leting County Party Committee Cultural Troupe," and most of the members are primary school teachers who were transferred. He Muzhang, Secretary of the Leting County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Li Bin, the County Chief, repeatedly wrote letters and sent special personnel to Leting Normal School to mobilize students such as Wang Fenghua and Zhao Ruizhen to participate in the work of the cultural troupe. When they disagreed, Li et al. adopted a "leadership decision" approach. This approach has an impact on the development of primary school education and the establishment of professional ideals for normal school students.

    反对随意抽调小学教师和师范生
    编辑同志：目前各地都感到小学教师不够，但是有的地方却把师范学校毕业生分配到其他岗位去工作。察哈尔省张家口师范，今年有两班毕业生，分配到教育工作岗位上的不到二十五人。大同师范、柴沟堡师范、张家口女师都有这种情况。被分配到其他行政部门的学生，多半不安心工作，感到所学非所用。河北乐亭县今年十月成立了一个“乐亭县委文工团”，团员大多是抽调的小学教员。中共乐亭县县委书记贺穆章和县长李斌再三写信并派专人到乐亭师范动员王凤华、赵瑞珍等同学去参加文工团工作。她们不同意，李等便采用了“领导决定”的方式。这样做的结果，对于小学教育的发展和师范生的建立专业思想是有影响的。    王军
