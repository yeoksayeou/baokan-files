    Investigation Report on the Embezzlement and Malfeasance of Cadres in the Changzhou Tax Bureau and the Bribery and Tax Evasion of Illegal Merchants
    Supervisory Committee of the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office
    (I) Investigation Process
    Prior to the discovery of this case, there was some suspicious material, but it did not attract the attention of the leaders in Changzhou, so it was not dealt with in a timely manner.
    In April of this year, when the Southern Jiangsu Tax Work Team came to Changzhou to assist in the work, it was discovered that some tax personnel were involved in embezzlement and bribery. Immediately, under the leadership of the Changzhou Tax Bureau and with the Southern Jiangsu Tax Work Team as the main force, a focused investigation was carried out, revealing serious tax evasion and bribery by businesses in the timber, silk and cotton cloth, and department store industries. At the same time, the city's tax bureau organized an anti-corruption study session for tax cadres. After more than a month of study, the personnel involved made preliminary confessions, admitting to embezzlement by 31 cadres, totaling only 170 million RMB; 83 businesses confessed to bribery, involving 600 million RMB in evaded national taxes. The main culprits of embezzlement, Zhou Qian, Gu Borong, Zhang Jiasheng, and the illegal merchant Zhang Junyi, owner of Yi Xin Department Store, were immediately detained by the court.
    The leaders of Changzhou generally exposed and criticized this case at the city's Political Consultative Committee and the People's Representative Conference and generally educated the business community. However, the investigation of the entire case was not thorough enough, and no serious and proper handling was done.
    In early July, the Supervisory Committee of the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office learned that this incident was extremely serious and had a very bad political impact. In order to handle it correctly, it invited the Southern Jiangsu Procuratorate, the Finance Department of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office, the Southern Jiangsu Tax Bureau, the Southern Jiangsu Daily, and the United Front Work Department of the District Party Committee to form an investigation team. Through the Changzhou Prefectural Office, the Changzhou District Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Changzhou Municipal People's Government, and the Changzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the case was carefully investigated again. At the same time, the court detained Shi Zhongxin, a tax official involved in serious embezzlement. The investigation process was divided into four steps: publicity and mobilization, confession and reflection, reporting and filling out forms, and focused accounting checks.
    The investigation of cadres was conducted through anti-corruption study sessions. At the beginning of the investigation, tax personnel with corrupt behavior had many ideological concerns, fearing being sent to court, being dismissed from their jobs, and being forced to return the stolen goods. Therefore, they were unwilling to confess. Later, after repeated mobilization and education, these concerns were eliminated. On the basis of improved understanding, tax cadres with corrupt behavior all wrote confessions and reflections, and most also made summaries of their anti-corruption studies.
    During the investigation, the business community initially had three concerns:
    (1) Upper-level elements feared losing face.
    (2) Small and medium-sized merchants feared supplementary taxes and fines.
    (3) Ordinary people feared being sued. Therefore, most businesses were unwilling to admit to tax evasion and bribery, emphasizing that the work style of tax cadres was bad and that merchants were forced to "pay for peace," not engaging in bribery. Most merchants who engaged in bribery and tax evasion said: "Our accounting skills are poor, and there are bound to be some shortcomings, not tax evasion." "Cadres' family members are sick, and we lend them money for 'medical treatment and saving lives,' with no intention of tax evasion or bribery." Some even colluded with tax cadres, asking them not to tell the truth, and threatened employees: "If my store closes, how will you live? Don't say anything good." Later, after repeated education and the promotion of employees, as well as the fact that tax cadres had already confessed some material, some merchants who had improved their understanding began to write confessions; some even made typical reports. For example, Qiang Yuchu, the person in charge of Li Xiang Cotton Cloth Store, confessed that his purpose of bribery was to evade taxes, evading a total of over 110 million RMB in taxes and bribing 16 million RMB. At the same time, he also revealed that many others in the industry were doing the same. In addition, Tang Mengxi, vice chairman of the Timber Industry Association, and Wang Zhongyuan of the silk and cloth industry (both representatives of the Changzhou People's Congress), also confessed and examined their role in mediating bribery and corrupting cadres. However, many businesses involved in bribery and tax evasion still concealed the facts and even resisted. After Qiang Yuchu, the person in charge of Li Xiang Cotton Cloth Store, confessed, several of his peers attacked and ridiculed him. The person in charge of Tian Chang Cotton Cloth Store said: "You've made progress too fast." "Who instructed you to confess?" "You admit to tax evasion, but we don't." Therefore, the government further educated the business community, criticizing their mistake of resisting the investigation, and conducted focused accounting checks on more than 20 companies in the dyeing and weaving industry, silk and cotton cloth industry, oil and sesame industry, and department store industry, uncovering 1.054 billion RMB in evaded taxes (including tax evasion by the public-owned cotton yarn and cloth company through yarn-for-cloth transactions).
    (II) Truth of the Incident
    1. Embezzlement and Bribery Situation
    After more than two months of investigation, a total of 85 tax cadres involved in embezzlement and 293 businesses in 55 industries involved in bribery were uncovered. The total amount of embezzlement by cadres was more than 243.6 million RMB, and the amount of national tax evaded by illegal merchants reached 1.054 billion RMB. This case spanned nearly two years, from June 1949 to April of this year when it was discovered. The embezzling cadres accounted for 37.6 percent of the city's tax cadres at the time. Among them, 45 had worked in Kuomintang agencies (17 had participated in reactionary parties and groups), and 37 were newly recruited cadres (including 8 members of the Youth League). Three were older cadres who came after the crossing of the Yangtze River (including two communists). In terms of responsibilities: 4 were section chiefs and directors, 79 were tax officials, and 2 were support staff. The scope covered all seven tax offices under the city tax bureau and various sections of local tax, direct tax, and commodity tax. Six cadres from the special district tax bureau also participated in the embezzlement (two of whom were transferred from the city tax bureau). Among them, Zhou Qian alone embezzled more than 50 million RMB, plus 2 taels of gold and 80 silver dollars, totaling more than 50 instances of embezzlement. Gu Borong embezzled more than 20 million RMB; Shi Zhongxin and 5 others embezzled more than 10 million RMB; 3 embezzled more than 5 million RMB; 7 embezzled more than 2 million RMB; 29 embezzled more than 500,000 RMB; and 39 embezzled less than 500,000 RMB. In terms of the nature of embezzlement: 58 were directly colluding with merchants to commit fraud, and 27 were indirectly profiting (i.e., understanding the case and soliciting or being corrupted by direct embezzlers). The four most serious embezzlers, Zhou Qian, Gu Borong, Zhang Jiasheng, and Shi Zhongxin, were all former tax personnel who had worked in Kuomintang agencies. They were consistently corrupt and lawless and had formed a small corrupt group. For example, they knew that the silk and cotton cloth industries were seriously evading taxes by exchanging yarn for cloth, but they did not investigate. Instead, they solicited bribes from the industry association through merchant Wang Zhongyuan (representative of the City People's Representative Conference) and colluded with Tian Chang, Li Xiang, He Cheng, Xie Qin, Zhonghua, and other cotton cloth stores to cover up tax evasion, obtaining 10.3 million RMB in bribes for their joint use. Therefore, the amount of embezzlement by the four of them reached more than 100 million RMB; the time was also the longest. Their usual work style was very bad, their lives were extravagant, and they lacked the excellent qualities that government workers should have. Therefore, the masses called them "ancestors of corruption" and hated them very much. Among them, Zhou Qian, in his work, took advantage of the initial weakness of the leadership's unfamiliarity with the business, deceived the leadership, and resisted the organization. For example, when collecting income tax in 1950, he colluded with illegal merchants to set the net profit rate very low. After the city tax bureau leadership discovered this and asked him to correct it, he resisted by saying, "If you want to raise it, do it yourselves, I can't do it." Usually, he often did not consult the leadership, but directly explained the tax law to merchants, acting arbitrarily and monopolizing the tax collection work of the Shuang Guifang tax office. He was arrogant and conceited, and other cadres in the tax office called Zhou Qian "Mr." and dared not offer opinions. Relying on his power, he fooled around with a woman from the Changzhou Daguan Garden Bookstore, often going to pubs and dance halls, living a life of extravagance, eating, drinking, and squandering money. On his thirtieth birthday in September 1950, he invited guests and received gifts from 18 large businesses totaling more than 1.9 million RMB.
    As for some illegal merchants, they had historical corrupt and bribery relationships with corrupt tax personnel, and they continued to collude and commit fraud after liberation. According to investigations, the most serious cases include Huang Shourong of Xie Yu Shun Silk and Cloth Store, who, in addition to bribing 3 million RMB and evading more than 130 million RMB in taxes, also helped other businesses bribe 7 times, totaling more than 16 million RMB; Zhang Zuqing, manager of Xie Qin Cloth Factory, bribed 2 million RMB and evaded more than 340 million RMB in taxes, and also bribed on behalf of three other businesses; Zhang Junyi, owner of Yi Xin Department Store and vice chairman of the Department Store Industry Association, bribed 600,000 RMB himself, evaded more than 7 million RMB in taxes, and also helped other businesses bribe and collectively bribe in the name of the association a total of more than 5 million RMB, of which he pocketed 1.5 million RMB, and also specifically stored embezzled bribes for Zhou Qian. Two businesses bribed more than 10 million RMB, five bribed more than 5 million RMB, fifty-seven bribed more than 1 million RMB, forty bribed more than 500,000 RMB, and one hundred and eighty-nine bribed less than 500,000 RMB. Among them, there were 11 representatives of the Changzhou People's Congress, and 15 associations collectively bribed cadres in the name of the association, totaling 562 instances of embezzlement and bribery.
    2. Development Process of the Incident
    This case, from small to large, from secret to semi-public, has gradually become public over the past two years. Because some tax personnel and merchants who had worked in Kuomintang agencies in the past had connections, and none of them had received the necessary transformation after liberation, they brought the bad behaviors of corruption, bribery, speculation, and tax evasion from the old society to the new society. For example, shortly after liberation, when Zhang Zhongping, chairman of the pawn industry, went to the Shuang Guifang tax office to get a business license, Zhou Qian said to Zhang because Zhang Zhongping had promised him a bribe before liberation but had not delivered it, "Are you here again!" Zhang was very embarrassed and replied, "Those who open shops always have to get a business license." Zhou Qian then said, "Aren't we tax collectors still collecting taxes!" Zhang understood and sent Zhou 200,000 RMB the next day. At the same time, the tax office and the city tax bureau leadership had serious bureaucratism and a purely technical perspective, lacking ideological leadership and political education for former tax personnel who had worked in Kuomintang agencies, and were ideologically paralyzed and blindly trusted them. For example, the director of the office, Huang Xiuzhou, believed that Zhou Qian was capable and could solve problems, so he treated him as a backbone; when the city tax bureau leadership discovered Zhou Qian's embezzlement of 450,000 RMB in land price tax outside Xiaonanmen in August 1950, they did not immediately seriously investigate and deal with it, allowing it to develop on its own. Therefore, embezzlement was allowed to develop. Secondly, a few leading cadres, such as Huang Xiuzhou, also borrowed money from corrupt cadres Zhou Qian and illegal merchant Wang Zhongyuan and accepted gifts from illegal merchant Huang Yunxi, often eating and drinking with corrupt cadres. Furthermore, Yu Yichao, the former deputy director of the Special District Tax Bureau, entrusted former personnel who had worked in Kuomintang agencies to sell "opium." Chen Zhendong, deputy director of the Changzhou Tax Bureau, was not serious enough in his life, accepting invitations to eat and drink from corrupt official Zhou Qian, and exchanging gifts with each other. He Yifeng, the former director, was also not serious in his life, had a weak mass concept, could not face the reflections of the masses squarely, and instead regarded Zhou Qian and Zhang Jiasheng as good cadres. The government leadership was also paralyzed, not understanding the situation for a long time, and not seriously and earnestly dealing with the reflections of cadres and the outside world. These situations gave bad cadres more opportunities. For example, Zhou Qian, seeing the above situation, secretly said to another tax cadre, Shi Zhongxin: "Now we can move." As a result, righteousness declined, and evil rose. Good cadres were not convinced and complained, saying: "Corruption and malfeasance are successful." Some cadres envied corruption, such as Zhou Qi, who said: "I hope I can learn to be as successful as Zhou Qian in the future." Furthermore, Yang Shidu, a cadre in the Shuang Guifang tax office, was originally not corrupt, but later became corrupt. As a result, an evil atmosphere of corruption, bribery, malfeasance, and tax evasion was created, and the scope of corruption expanded. For example, in the summer of 1949, there were only four corrupt cadres, but by winter there were 21, in the spring of 1950 the number increased to 36, in the winter of the same year it increased to 69, and by the summer of 1951, when the investigation was conducted, it had expanded to 85; the number of bribing businesses spread to nearly 300.
    The amount of embezzlement and bribery also gradually increased from small to large. In 1949, each time it was only 100,000 or 200,000 RMB, then hundreds of thousands of RMB, millions of RMB, and later the amount of embezzlement and bribery reached more than 10 million RMB at a time.
    (III) Ways and Methods of Corruption, Bribery, and Tax Evasion
    A. Ways and Methods of Corruption and Bribery
    1. Using Power to Commit Fraud in Accounting Checks. There are two situations: one situation is that when accounting checks find suspicious points, in addition to bringing the account books to the tax office or tax bureau, they temporarily conceal them and do not let the leadership know; at the same time, they deliberately exaggerate to the merchants, saying, "You will be fined so many times, so many times!" The merchants are guilty and ask someone to intercede, and the result is a lenient punishment. The merchants know what to do and send money to "thank" them. This is the general situation. Some merchants and cadres also haggle over the amount of bribes like doing business. For example, Li Xiang Cotton Cloth Store used "production and sales certificates" to evade taxes. When tax cadres Zhou Qian and Sun Boyuan discovered this, they haggled with Wang Zhongda and Huang Shourong of the silk and cotton cloth industry association and Qiang Yuchu, the manager of Li Xiang Cotton Cloth Store, for several days, settling the matter by bribing 7 million RMB.
    The other situation is that when merchants find that their accounts are false during accounting checks, they immediately take the initiative to find someone to "smooth things over" with the tax cadres and send bribes to settle the matter. Some cadres also deliberately shelve the account books of businesses after they are transferred back, waiting for the merchants to take the initiative to send bribes, which is a means of extortion.
    2. Collective Embezzlement and Joint Profit Sharing. Corrupt tax personnel also form small groups, generally based on the responsible business department, collectively accepting bribes and sharing the spoils together. For example, when Shi Zhongxin and others accepted 3.5 million RMB in bribes from Gong Sheng Timber Company for evading stamp tax, Shi gave 1.75 million RMB to Zhang Jiasheng because Zhang was responsible for stamp tax business, but if one person could completely handle the matter, the bribe would be exclusive.
    3. Colluding with Each Other and Sharing Tax Money. The slaughter tax is calculated by printing each head of the animal. If the tax ticket is missing one head of pig, the tax of this head of pig will be divided equally between the slaughterer and the tax personnel. For example, tax personnel Zhu Yun confessed that he collected slaughter tax for 20 days and embezzled 500,000 RMB in slaughter tax; slaughterers also admitted that no household did not collude with tax personnel to evade taxes.
    4. Altering Payment Vouchers to Commit Fraud and Embezzlement. Tax personnel used the method of altering payment receipts for land price tax to commit embezzlement. For example, when tax cadre Gao Qingshou paid 1.25 million RMB in property tax on behalf of resident Chen Yujian, he only paid 50,000 RMB and embezzled 1.2 million RMB.
    5. "Borrowing" from Merchants. Tax personnel Wang Chunming and Gu Borong (both on salary system) often used the excuse that their families were having financial difficulties, their wives were giving birth and not enough expenses, etc., to "borrow" from familiar merchants. At the same time, merchants who lent money to tax personnel would naturally receive many conveniences and were happy to lend money to tax personnel. For example, the Timber Industry Association once lent Wang Chunming 1 million RMB, which was never repaid. It was actually a disguised form of corruption and bribery.
    6. Bribing on Behalf of Others and Pocketing the Middleman's Share. Some merchants specialize in acting as bridges for bribery, bribing on behalf of others, and corrupting cadres, such as Wang Zhongyuan and Huang Shourong in the silk and cotton cloth industry. Some individuals also pocketed the middleman's share, such as Zhang Yongji, director of the Salt Industry Association, who embezzled a lot of bribe money (and has escaped). Merchants often sent gifts and hosted banquets for tax personnel in their personal or association names during festivals.
    B. Ways and Methods of Tax Evasion
    1. Bartering. Some dyeing and weaving industries and silk and cotton cloth stores directly "bartered yarn for cloth" (the public-owned cotton yarn and cloth company also did this), without processing it as purchase and sales, in order to evade business tax, etc. For example, Xie Qin Dyeing and Weaving Factory used this method to evade a total of more than 34.154 million RMB in taxes.
    2. Customer Inventory, Unclear Delivery Accounts, Private Transfer, Not Processed as Purchase and Sales, to Evade Taxes. For example, Xie Yu Shun Cotton Cloth Store had 74 rolls of cloth stored by customers from mid-February to the end of May last year. When they were taken out, there was no proof, evading more than 1.4 million RMB in taxes.
    3. Operating Off-the-Books, Sales Not Recorded, to Evade Taxes. For example, Hua Feng Department Store has successively purchased goods without invoices in Shanghai and retail stores in the past two years, and does not issue invoices or record them when selling, evading an estimated 45 million RMB in business volume and evading 324,000 RMB in taxes.
    4. Setting Up False Accounts. For example, Mei Feng Cloth Store set up false accounts, and only the copied part revealed more than 370,000 RMB in tax evasion.
    5. Evading Stamp Tax. For example, Zhiyuan Cloth Factory prepaid Yixin Xiaofen Company 30 million RMB for goods in February last year, and although receipts were issued, no stamps were affixed.
    6. Forging Seat Merchant Invoices and Swallowing the Withheld Temporary Business Tax. For example, Tong Xin Department Store purchased 40 pounds of wool yarn from itinerant merchants in November last year, withholding temporary business tax, but did not pay it into the treasury. Instead, it privately carved the stamp of Lianmei Company, falsely claiming to have purchased it from a seat merchant and swallowed the withheld 450,000 RMB in temporary business tax.
    (IV) Reactions of Cadres and the Masses
    The reactions from all sides were numerous before and after this incident was investigated. The erroneous saying that "corruption and malfeasance are successful" was popular among tax personnel. Ordinary cadres said: "It's strange that the leadership doesn't know about such a serious corruption incident!" In the business community, tax personnel were called "bailiffs" (public servants in the old yamen), and they even thought that "as long as you have money, there is a way to go." Some employees and shop assistants said: "He was the same during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit era, and he is the same now. How can the People's Government trust them!" People from all walks of life expressed dissatisfaction with the government's failure to deal with these incidents, thus suspecting the policies of the People's Government.
    It was only after this comprehensive investigation that the dissatisfaction of all parties began to be reversed. First, tax personnel reacted: "In the past, boasting and flattering were successful, but now they will be sued!" The workers of He Cheng Weaving Bag Factory said: "In the past, I didn't believe in the People's Government, but now I know that was wrong." The workers of the construction industry, department store industry, silk and cotton cloth industry, southern goods industry, and paint industry in Changzhou had the same reaction in chat sessions: "In the past, we had many incorrect views about the People's Government, but now we know that the People's Government absolutely does not allow corruption and malfeasance." "It's better to do business honestly. Speculation and profiteering, bribery and tax evasion will eventually suffer."
    In short, it can be seen from the above reflections that this serious incident not only caused great economic losses to the country, but also seriously damaged the political prestige of the People's Government, greatly affected the relationship between the People's Government and the people, and also corroded the excellent qualities that the tax cadres of the People's Government should have. Good cadres could not give full play to their enthusiasm in their work. In addition, due to the bribery and tax evasion of illegal merchants, it also hindered the enthusiasm of legitimate merchants in their operations, thus seriously affecting the implementation of various tasks of the People's Government. Therefore, this incident must be dealt with seriously.

    关于常州市税务局干部贪污舞弊和不法商人
    行贿逃税事件的检查报告
    苏南人民行政公署人民监察委员会
    （一）检查经过
    本案在发觉前已有一些可疑材料，但没有引起常州市领导方面的重视和注意，因此没有及时提出处理。
    今年四月份，苏南税务工作队到常州市帮助工作时，发现部分税务工作人员有贪污受贿情形。当即由常州市税务局主持，以苏南税务工作队为主，进行了有重点的检查，发现木业、绸土布业、百货业等商号有严重的逃税行贿行为；同时在税务干部方面，即由市税务局组织了一次反贪污学习。经过一个多月的学习，有关人员作了初步的坦白，计坦白出的贪污干部有三十一人、坦白的贪污数目只有人民币一亿七千余万元；行贿商号有八十三家，逃漏国税有六亿多元。贪污主犯周谦、顾伯榕、张家声及不法商人一新百货店老板张俊仪等当即为法院扣押。
    常州市领导方面，虽将这一案情在市协商委员会和市各界人民代表会议上进行了揭发和批判，并一般地对工商界进行了教育。但对整个案情来说，追究得还不够彻底，也没有作严肃妥善的处理。
    七月初，苏南人民监察委员会了解到这一事件极为严重，政治影响极坏，为了能够进行正确处理，即邀请苏南检察署、苏南行署财政处、苏南税务局、苏南日报社、区党委统战部等单位，组成了检查团，通过常州专署、中共常州地委、常州市人民政府、中共常州市委，对这一案件又认真地进行了检查。同时法院又扣押了贪污严重的税务人员石仲信。检查过程分宣传动员、坦白反省、检举填表和重点查账等四步。
    对干部的检查是通过反贪污学习进行的。在检查中，起初有贪污行为的税务人员思想顾虑很多，怕送法院、怕撤职失业、怕倒赃，因此不肯坦白。后来经过反复动员教育，消除了这些人员的顾虑，在提高认识的基础上，有贪污行为的税务干部都写了坦白反省书，一般的也都做了反贪污学习总结。
    在检查中，工商界开始时有三种顾虑：
    （一）上层分子怕丢面子。
    （二）中小商人则怕补税罚款。
    （三）一般的怕吃官司。因此，大部分商号不肯承认有逃税行贿行为，强调税务干部作风不好，商人是被迫的“出钱求安”，不是行贿。大部行贿逃税的商人则说：“我们会计业务技术差，难免有些缺点，不是逃税。”“干部家属有病，我们借钱给他是‘治病救命’，没有逃税行贿企图。”有的则拉拢税务干部要税务人员别说实话，同时威胁职工：“我店关了，你们生活怎么办，不要说的好。”后来经过反复的教育，加上职工的推动，同时税务干部已先坦白了一部分材料，在这样的情况下，部分认识提高的商人开始写了坦白书；有的并且作了典型报告，像立祥棉布号负责人强彧础，就坦白了他行贿的目的是为了逃税，一共逃了一亿一千多万元税款，行贿了一千六百万元，同时他还揭发了很多同业也有这样情形。此外木业公会副主任汤梦熹，绸布业的汪仲远（都是常州市人民代表），对自己做行贿的媒介、腐蚀干部，也进行了坦白检查。但是很多行贿逃税的商号，还是隐瞒事实，甚至有对抗的。像立祥棉布号负责人强彧础坦白后，就有几家同业打击讽刺他，天昌棉布号负责人说：“你进步得太快了。”“是谁指使你坦白的？”“你承认逃税我们不承认。”因此政府方面又进一步对工商界进行了教育，批判了他们对抗检查的错误，并进行重点查账，共查了染织业、绸土布业、油麻业，百货业等二十余家，查出逃漏税十亿五千四百余万元（包括公营花纱布公司以纱换布漏税在内）。
    （二）事件真相
    一、贪污行贿情况
    本案经过两个多月的检查，计查出贪污税务干部八十五人，行贿商号五十五个行业，二九三家，干部贪污数额共二亿四千三百六十多万元，不法商人逃漏国家税款达十亿五千四百余万元。这案件自一九四九年六月间起至今年四月被察觉为止，时间将近两年，贪污干部占当时市税务干部总数的百分之三十七点六，其中曾在国民党机关工作过的人员四十五人（参加过反动党、团的人员有十七人），新参加工作的干部三十七人（内青年团员八人）。渡江来的较老干部三人（内两个共产党员）。按职责分：股长、所长四人，税务员七十九人，勤杂人员二人。其范围遍及市税务局所属七个税务所及地方税、直接税、货物税各股，专区税务局也有六个干部参加贪污（内二个是从市税务局调去的）。其中贪污五千万元以上的周谦一人，另黄金二两、银元八十枚，共贪污五十多次。贪污二千万元以上的顾伯榕一人；贪污一千万元以上的石仲信等五人；贪污五百万元以上的三人；贪污二百万元以上的七人；贪污五十万元以上的二十九人；贪污不足五十万元的三十九人。以贪污性质论：直接和商人勾结舞弊的五十八人，间接分肥（即了解案情、向直接贪污分子索借或受其腐蚀分给）的二十七人，贪污最严重的周谦、顾伯榕、张家声、石仲信四人，都是曾在国民党机关工作过的旧税务人员。他们一贯贪污枉法，并且形成了一个贪污小集团。例如他们明知绸业、土布业以纱易布严重逃税，却不予查究，竟通过商人汪仲远（市各界人民代表会议代表）向该业公会索贿，并且和天昌、立祥、合成、协勤、中华等棉布号勾结舞弊，包庇逃税，得贿一千零三十万元，共同分用。因此，他们四人贪污的款项多达一亿多元；时间也最长，他们平日作风又非常恶劣，生活奢侈，毫无人民政府工作人员应有的优良品质。所以群众叫他们“贪污祖宗”，对他们非常痛恨。其中周谦在工作中并乘领导方面最初对业务不熟的弱点，欺骗领导，对抗组织。如征收一九五○年所得税时，就和不法商人勾结，将纯益率订得很低。经市税务局领导方面发觉，要他纠正，他即以“要提高，你们自己来搞，我没有办法”等来对抗。平时往往不请示领导，迳自对商人解释税法，独断独行，个人统制了双桂坊税务所的税收工作，骄傲自大，税务所其他干部都叫周谦为“先生”，有意见也不敢提；他凭借职权，和常州大观园书场某女人鬼混，经常上酒馆、舞厅，花天酒地吃喝挥霍；在一九五○年九月做三十岁生日，请客收十八家大商号馈礼共一百九十余万元。
    至于某些不法商人，和贪污的税务工作人员都有历史上的贪污行贿关系，解放后就继续勾结舞弊。据查出其中最严重的如协裕顺绸布号的黄寿荣，除自己行贿三百万元、逃税一亿三千余万元外，还帮助其他商号行贿七次，计一千六百余万元；协勤布厂的经理张祖庆行贿二百万元、逃税三亿四千余万元，并又替三家商号行贿；一新百货号老板、百货业公会副主任张俊仪，自己行贿六十万元，逃税七百多万元，还帮助其他商号行贿及以公会名义集体行贿共计五百多万元，其中自己中饱一百五十万元，另又专替周谦存放贪污贿款。商号中行贿一千万元以上的二家、五百万元以上的五家、一百万元以上的五十七家、五十万元以上的四十家、五十万元以下的一百八十九家。其中有常州市人民代表十一人，以公会名义集体向干部行贿的有十五个公会，总计贪污行贿次数五百六十二次。
    二、事件发展过程
    这案件由小而大，由秘密而半公开，两年来是逐渐公开化的。由于部分曾在国民党机关工作过的税务人员和商人过去都有联系，解放后都没有得到应有的改造，把过去旧社会的贪污、行贿、投机、逃税等恶劣行为，带到新社会里来了。例如解放后不久，典当业理事长张仲平到双桂坊税务所领营业牌照时，周谦因张仲平在解放前答应给他一笔贿款没有送来，周就对张说：“你又来了么！”张很尴尬，回说：“开店的总是要领营业牌照的。”周谦接着说：“我们收税的还不是照样收税吗！”张会意，第二天就送周二十万元。同时税务所和市税务局领导方面，都存在着严重的官僚主义和单纯的技术观点，对曾在国民党机关工作过的旧税务人员缺乏思想领导和政治教育，思想麻痹，盲目信任。如所长黄秀洲，认为周谦有能力，能解决问题，就把他当做一个骨干；当市税局领导方面在一九五○年八月发现周谦贪污小南门外地价税四十五万元事件时，竟不立即认真追究处理，任其自流。因此使贪污有了发展。其次少数领导干部，如黄秀洲还向贪污干部周谦及不法商人汪仲远借钱，并接受不法商人黄云西的礼物，同贪污干部时常一起吃喝。再如前专署税务局副局长余一超，曾托以前在国民党机关工作过的旧人员出售“鸦片”。常州市税务局副局长陈振东生活上不够严肃，接受贪污分子周谦邀请吃喝，互送礼物，前任局长贺一峰生活上也不严肃，群众观念薄弱，不能正视群众反映，反把周谦，张家声当做好干部，在市政府领导方面也很麻痹，长时期不了解下情，对干部及外界的反映，没有认真严肃地对待，这些情形使坏干部更有机可乘。如周谦看到以上这些情形，就对另一税务干部石仲信暗地里说：“现在我们可以动了。”使得正气下降，邪气上升。好的干部不服气，发牢骚说：“贪污舞弊吃得开。”有的干部羡慕贪污，如周祺说：“我以后能够学到和周谦一样吃得开就好了。”再像双桂坊税务所干部杨时度，本来是不贪污的，以后也就贪污了。因之造成了贪污行贿舞弊逃税的恶劣风气，贪污事件也就扩大了范围。如一九四九年夏季，贪污干部只有四人，到冬季就有二十一人，到一九五○年春季增加到三十六人，同年冬季又增加到六十九人，到一九五一年夏季检查时，已扩展到八十五人；行贿的商号蔓延到近三百家。
    贪污行贿金额，也是由小而大逐渐增多的。一九四九年开始时每次只有一、二十万元，以后的数十万元、数百万元，再以后贪污行贿的款子，有一次就达一千万元以上。
    （三）贪污行贿逃税的方式方法
    甲、贪污行贿的方式方法
    一、利用职权，查账舞弊。这有两种情况：一种情况是在查账查到疑点时，除将账册带税务所或税务局外，暂时隐瞒，不让领导方面知道；同时对商人故意虚张声势地说：“要罚多少倍、多少倍！”商人心虚，就托人说情，结果是从宽处罚，商人心中有数，就送款“酬谢”，这是一般的情况。也有些商人和干部，在贿赂款项的数字上，和做生意一样讨价还价。如立祥棉布号利用“产销证明书”进行逃税，被税务干部周谦、孙博渊发觉，他们就和绸土布业工会汪仲达、黄寿荣以及立祥棉布号经理强彧础等讨价还价，谈了几天，以行贿七百万元了结。
    另一种情况是在查账时，商人因为账目有虚假，立即主动找人出面向税务干部“疏通”，送贿了事。也有些干部将商号账册调回后，故意暂时搁置，不立即审查，等待商人主动送贿，这是一种勒索的手段。
    二、集体贪污，合伙分赃。贪污的税务人员，也有结成小集团的，大体是以主管业务部门为单位，集体受贿、共同分赃。如石仲信等接受公盛木行逃漏印花税贿款三百五十万元时，因张家声负责印花税业务，石就分给张一百七十五万元，但如一个人能够完全办妥的事情，则贿款独得。
    三、互相勾结，朋分税款。屠宰税是以每头打印计税的，税票上少打一头猪，这一头猪的税，屠商和税务人员就各得一半。如税务人员朱云坦白，他收了二十天的屠宰税，就贪污屠宰税五十万元；屠商也承认没有一户不勾结税务人员逃税的。
    四、涂改缴款凭证，舞弊贪污。税务人员对地价税，采用涂改缴款书的办法，进行贪污。如税务干部高庆寿代住户陈雨涧缴纳房产税一百二十五万元时，只缴五万元，贪污一百二十万元。
    五、向商人“借贷”。税务人员王春明、顾伯榕（均薪给制）经常藉口家中生活困难，老婆生孩子不够开支等等，向熟悉的商人“借贷”。同时商人借钱给税务人员，自会得到许多方便，也乐于借钱给税务人员。如木业公会曾一次借给王春明一百万元，这些钱是有借无还的，实际是变相的贪污行贿。
    六、代人行贿，贪污中饱。商人方面有专做贿赂桥梁、代人行贿、腐蚀干部的。如绸土布业的汪仲远、黄寿荣等。个别的还贪污中饱，如盐业公会主任张永基，贪污中饱贿款很多（已逃跑）。商人逢时逢节，以私人或公会名义，向税务人员送礼请客等，则是经常的事。
    乙、逃税漏税的方式方法
    一、以物易物。部分染织业及绸土布号，进行直接“以纱易布”交易（公营花纱布公司也是如此的），不作进销货处理以逃漏营业税等。如协勤染织厂就利用这种方法逃漏了税款共计三亿四千一百五十四万多元。
    二、客户存货、提货账目含糊，私自划转，不作进销货处理，以进行逃税。如协余顺棉布号在去年二月中到五月底，客户存布七十四匹，提取时没有证明，逃漏税款一百四十万多元。
    三、账外营业，销货不登账，以进行逃税。如华丰百货号去今两年在上海及门市陆续收购无发票货物，出售时也不开发票，不登账，约计逃漏营业额四千五百万元，逃漏税款三百二十四万元。
    四、设置假账。如美丰布号设置假账仅就抄得部分，查出逃税三十七万多元。
    五、逃漏印花税。如志远布厂，去年二月预付益新小粉号货款三千万元，虽立收据，但未贴印花。
    六、伪造座商发票，吞扣临商税。如同新百货号在去年十一月间，向行商购进绒线四十磅，代扣临商税，但未缴库，便私刻联美号戳记，借名向座商买进吞吃已扣临商税四十五万元。
    （四）干部和群众的反应
    这一事件在检查前后，各方面的反应很多。在税务人员中曾流行“贪污舞弊吃得开”的错误说法。一般干部说：“这种严重贪污事件领导方面不知道，很奇怪！”在工商界中把税务人员叫“皂隶”（旧衙门里的公差），甚至于以为“只要有钱，就有路可走。”在职工、店员中有人说：“蒋匪帮时代也是他，现在又是他，人民政府怎么信任他们！”各界人民对政府不处理这些事件表示不满，因此怀疑人民政府的政策。
    经过这次全面的检查，才开始扭转了各方面的不满情绪。首先、税务人员反应：“过去吹牛拍马吃得开，现在要吃官司了！”合成织袋厂的职工则说：“过去我对人民政府不相信，现在知道这是错了。”常州市建筑业、百货业、绸土布业、南货业、颜料业的职工，在漫谈会中，曾有同样的反应：“过去对人民政府有很多不正确的看法，现在才知道人民政府是绝不准许有贪污舞弊事情的。”“做生意还是老老实实的好，投机倒把，行贿逃税，最后终是吃苦头。”
    总之，从上述反映中可以看出，这一严重事件不但使国家在经济上受了很大损失，并且严重地破坏了人民政府的政治威信，极大地影响了人民政府和人民群众的关系，同时也腐蚀了人民政府的税务干部应有的优良品质，好的干部也就不能发挥工作上的积极性。另外，由于不法商人的行贿逃税，也妨碍了正当商人经营上的积极性，因此也严重地影响到人民政府各项工作的贯彻。所以对此事件必须严肃处理。
