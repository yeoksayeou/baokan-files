    China Petroleum Corporation North China Region Company
    Should Not Engage in Extravagance and Lavish Feasts
    Editor: The Tianjin oil depot of the North China Region Company of China Petroleum Corporation experienced a fire on November 11th. Afterward, the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government, the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government, and the head office of the China Petroleum Corporation dispatched personnel to Tianjin to cooperate with relevant units in Tianjin to investigate the cause of the fire and responsibility. After this task was completed, the North China Region Company of China Petroleum Corporation hosted a banquet on December 1st to entertain the inspection personnel from various units, and after the banquet, invited them to see a play. As far as I know, except for the comrades from the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate who did not attend, more than 30 inspection personnel from other units participated. The North China Region Company of China Petroleum Corporation spent more than one million yuan on the meal alone. I believe this kind of extravagance is inappropriate. Moreover, the host is the inspected party, and the guests are the inspectors. It is even more inappropriate to treat them to a banquet and a play like this. I believe that the North China Region Company of China Petroleum Corporation should publicly examine the motive for hosting the banquet, and the inspection personnel from the various units who attended the banquet should also examine their mistakes.

    中国石油公司华北区公司
    不应铺张浪费随意请客吃饭
    编辑同志：中国石油公司华北区公司天津某贮油库，在十一月十一日发生火警事件。事后，中央人民政府最高人民检察署、中央人民政府人民监察委员会以及中国石油公司总公司等单位，派员到天津，配合天津市有关单位查究失火原因和责任。这项任务结束后，中国石油公司华北区公司在十二月一日设宴招待各单位检查人员，宴后并请他们观剧。据我所知，除了天津市人民检察署的同志没有出席外，其他各单位检查人员三十多人都参加了。单只餐费一项，中国石油公司华北区公司就花了一百多万元。我认为这种铺张浪费实属不当。而且主人是被检查者，客人是执行检查者，这样请客看戏，就更不妥当。我认为中国石油公司华北区公司应公开检讨请客动机，参加宴会的各单位检查人员也应检查错误。    张振芳
