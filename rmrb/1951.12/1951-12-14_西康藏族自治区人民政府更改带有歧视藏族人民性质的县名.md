The People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has decided to abolish the county names of Ba'an, Zhanhua, Lihua, and Dingxiang, which originally had a discriminatory nature towards the Tibetan people. Ba'an County is renamed Batang County, Zhanhua County is renamed Xinlong County, Lihua County is renamed Litang County, and Dingxiang County is renamed Xiangcheng County. These newly changed county names were proposed by the People's Governments of Ba'an and other four counties after widely soliciting the opinions of the local Tibetan people and jointly studying with the Tibetan representatives of each county, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on handling titles, place names, steles, and plaques with discriminatory or insulting nature towards minority nationalities. These newly changed county names have been approved by the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government and have been submitted to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for verification.

Note: Ba'an County was originally named Batang. In 1905, when Feng Quan, the Manchu Qing feudal dynasty's resident minister in Tibet, ruled Batang, the local Tibetan people, unable to bear his cruel oppression, rose up in resistance. The Manchu Qing government sent Sichuan's Chief Military Officer Ma Weiqi to suppress them, burning down the Kangning Lama Temple in Batang County, and massacring more than 100 people, including the Batang Tusi and chieftains. Afterwards, Batang was renamed Ba'an, indicating that the people of Batang were suppressed by force, and the reactionary rulers could be "safe and sound." Zhanhua was originally named Zadui, and Lihua was originally named Litang. These were renamed by the Kuomintang reactionaries based on their reactionary policy of so-called assimilation of ethnic minorities. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西康藏族自治区人民政府更改带有歧视藏族人民性质的县名
    西康省藏族自治区人民政府决定将原来带有歧视藏族人民性质的巴安、瞻化、理化、定乡等县名废除，将巴安县改为巴塘县，瞻化县改为新龙县，理化县改为理塘县，定乡县改为乡城县。这些新改的县名，是遵照中央人民政府政务院关于处理带有歧视或侮辱少数民族性质的称谓、地名、碑碣、匾联的指示，由巴安等四县人民政府广泛征求当地藏族人民的意见，并和各该县的藏族代表人物共同研究后提出来的。这些新改的县名，已经藏族自治区人民政府批准，并已呈报中央人民政府政务院核定。
    按：巴安县原名巴塘。一九零五年满清封建王朝驻藏帮办大臣凤全统治巴塘时，当地藏族人民不堪其残酷压迫起而反抗。满清政府派四川提督马维骐前往镇压，焚毁巴塘县康宁喇嘛寺，屠杀了巴塘土司及头人等一百多名，事后并将巴塘改为巴安，表示用武力镇压了巴塘人民，反动统治者可以“安然无事”。瞻化原名杂对，理化原名理塘，都是国民党反动派根据其对少数民族的所谓同“化”的反动政策而更名的。（新华社）
