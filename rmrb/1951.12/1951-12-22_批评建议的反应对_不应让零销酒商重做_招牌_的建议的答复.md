Response to Criticism and Suggestions Regarding the Suggestion "Retail Liquor Dealers Should Not Be Made to Redo Signboards"

To the Editor: We sincerely accept the suggestion made by Comrade Liu Fuying in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on November 28, "Retail Liquor Dealers Should Not Be Made to Redo Signboards."

The North China Monopoly General Company did indeed have regulations regarding unified names, signboard sizes, and font markings. However, when arranging this work, we considered the difficulties of some retailers, so we decided on the following methods to strive for gradual unification:

一、Retailers with original signboards can refresh their original signboards and change the wording for use, and those who voluntarily unify the size are not limited.

二、Newly developed liquor dealers or those who are just making new signboards should follow the new size requirements.

Currently, the results of liquor dealers voluntarily implementing this are: some are made according to the new size, some have added wood to enlarge the original signboards, and some have refreshed the original signboards and changed the wording. We did not require every retail liquor dealer in the city to make a new liquor signboard of the prescribed size.

Last year, we made regulations on the size and wording of signboards for retailers, and mobilized most liquor dealers to make them once. However, at that time, the North China Monopoly General Company did not make unified regulations, which caused the retailers to waste money. We have reviewed this and will never allow waste to happen to liquor dealers again. This time, the comrades at the Changxindian Monopoly Branch did not explain this work sufficiently and did not implement the company's spirit. We have asked them to conduct a deep review.

### 批评建议的反应对“不应让零销酒商重做  招牌”的建议的答复

    批评建议的反应对“不应让零销酒商重做
    招牌”的建议的答复
    编辑同志：阅读人民日报十一月二十八日“读者来信”栏刘福瀛同志所提“不应让零销酒商重做招牌”的建议，我们表示诚意接受。
    华北专卖总公司确曾有统一名称、牌子尺寸和字样标志的规定。但我们在布置这一工作时，已考虑到某些零销商的困难，因此决定以下办法，争取逐渐统一：
    一、原有牌子的零销商，可就原牌刷新，改换字面使用，如自愿统一尺寸者不限。
    二、新发展酒商或才制新牌子者，一律按新尺寸办理。
    目前酒商自愿执行的结果是：有按新尺寸作的，有把原牌加木拼大的，有把原牌刷新改换字面使用的。我们并没有让全市零销酒商每户都作一块新规定尺寸的卖酒招牌。
    我们曾在去年，对零销商挂牌，作了大小及字面的规定，动员大部酒商作了一次，但那时华北专卖总公司没有作统一规定，因而使零销商浪费了一笔款，我们已作了检讨，今后决不再让酒商有浪费事件发生。这次长辛店专卖分处同志，对这一工作解释不够，没有贯彻公司精神，我们已让他们作深刻检讨。    北京市专卖事业公司
