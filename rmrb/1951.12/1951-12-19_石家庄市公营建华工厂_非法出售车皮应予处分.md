To the Editor:

The Shijiazhuang Public Jianhua Factory sold railcars they had applied for to private merchants, obtaining significant illegal profits. In October, the Public Jianhua Factory applied for one hundred railcars from Shangxizhuang and Kouquan stations. They sold five of these railcars to Shangxizhuang Yuxing Coal Yard, receiving 1.3 million yuan per railcar. In December, this factory applied for another fifteen railcars from Kouquan Station. They bought coal from the Kouquan Yanwo Coal Mine for just over 6 million yuan per railcar, but upon resale, including the railcar, received a total of 8 million yuan per railcar. Eight of these railcars (including coal) were handled by the Datong Beijie Jufeng Consignment Store and sold to the Shanghai Fuda Coal Company. The Jianhua Factory has no need for coal in Shanghai and does not operate a coal business itself; it is completely relying on its status as a public factory to engage in illegal profiteering. I believe relevant departments should thoroughly investigate and seriously handle this matter.

    石家庄市公营建华工厂
    非法出售车皮应予处分
    编辑同志：石家庄市公营建华工厂把申请到的运煤车皮卖给私商，获得大量非法利润。十月份，公营建华工厂向尚希庄、口泉两车站申请了一百个车皮。把其中的五个车皮，卖给尚希庄裕兴煤栈，每个车皮得款一百三十万元。十二月份，这个工厂又向口泉车站申请了十五个车皮。他们从口泉燕窝煤窑买了煤，每车皮的煤只六百多万元，但转手之间，连车皮出售，每车共得款八百万元。其中八个车皮（连煤）由大同北街聚丰委托商店经手，卖给上海福达煤号。建华工厂在上海并没有需要煤的机构，本身又不经营煤业，完全是凭借公营工厂名义，进行非法牟利。我认为有关部门应彻底检查，郑重处理这件事。　孟致中
