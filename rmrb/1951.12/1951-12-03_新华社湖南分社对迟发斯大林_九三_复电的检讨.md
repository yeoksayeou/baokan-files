    Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The article "Seriously Treat Chairman Mao's and Marshal Stalin's Letters and Telegrams" published in the "Cultural Life" section of the People's Daily on October 11th, criticized our branch for the delayed transmission of Marshal Stalin's "September 3rd" reply telegram. We hereby offer the following self-criticism:

    Because the New Hunan Daily has an early deadline (generally 1:00 AM), we mistakenly believed that this news would arrive after 2:00 AM, and even if sent to the newspaper, it would not be used. This thinking was the direct cause of this error. Because of this thinking, we did not send this news to the newspaper that night.

    Before and after the People's Daily's criticism, we have conducted two self-criticisms among the comrades in the telecommunications department. The main shortcomings are that we failed to fulfill the responsibilities of a news agency, coupled with a very low political level, resulting in an undue oversight of this important issue. The comrades concerned have made self-criticisms and re-established a manuscript sending contract with the night shift editors of the New Hunan Daily to ensure that major news is not missed in the future.

### 新华社湖南分社对迟发斯大林“九三”复电的检讨

    对迟发斯大林“九三”复电的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报十月十一日“文化生活”栏内所载“严肃地对待毛主席和斯大林大元帅的函电”一文，批评了本分社迟发斯大林大元帅“九三”复电的错误，兹作如下检讨：
    因为新湖南报截稿时间早（一般是早晨一点钟），我们就错误地认为这项消息发来估计要在二时以后，发给报社也不会用。这种思想是造成这次错误的直接原因。因为有这种思想，所以当夜就没有把这项新闻送给报社。
    人民日报批评前后，我们已在电台同志中进行了两次检讨，主要缺点是没尽到通讯社应尽的责任，加以政治水平很低，致使对这一重大问题发生不应有的疏忽。现有关同志已进行检讨并与新湖南报夜班编辑重新订立发稿合同，保证今后不误重大新闻的发稿时间。
