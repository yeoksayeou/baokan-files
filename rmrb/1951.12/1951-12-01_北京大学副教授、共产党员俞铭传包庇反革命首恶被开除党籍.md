Peking University Associate Professor and Communist Party Member
Yu Mingchuan Expelled from Party for Harboring Counter-Revolutionary Ring Leader

Yu Mingchuan (Communist Party member), an associate professor in the Department of Western Languages at Peking University, lost his stance during the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement by harboring landlords and counter-revolutionary ringleaders. He has been expelled from the Party.

Yu Mingchuan is from Lintan Village, Nanling County, Anhui Province, and comes from a landlord family. He is 36 years old. He graduated from the Foreign Language Department of Wuhan University and the Graduate School of Tsinghua University. He infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party in March 1948. After liberation, he served as a lecturer at Peking University, Chairman of the Lecturers and Assistants Union, Standing Committee Member of the School Affairs Committee, and Director of the Office of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union, among other important positions. Before the liberation of the Southern Anhui region, he wrote to his elder brother, Yu Dingchuan, encouraging him to sell his land to evade the land reform struggle. After liberation, he wrote to his elder brother several times, telling him to sell his farm tools and other belongings, and repeatedly urged him to go out to work to escape the people's sanctions.

Who exactly was Yu Dingchuan? He was a local tyrant landlord and counter-revolutionary ringleader in Lintan Village, Nanling County, Southern Anhui (he has now been executed by firing squad). In the past, he consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities: planning the "encirclement and suppression" of our guerrilla forces behind enemy lines, and murdering seventy to eighty revolutionary cadres and masses, including our County Party Committee Deputy Secretary and Battalion Commander. He also forcibly extorted rent, grain, and funds from peasants, and conscripted nearly a thousand men. On the eve of the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River, he hid and burned important archives and documents to cover up his bloody crimes. After the People's Liberation Army liberated the area, he continued to be an enemy of the people, undermining and slandering the great land reform movement. In December 1950, he was arrested by the People's Government due to numerous accusations from the masses.

After Yu Dingchuan was arrested by the People's Government, Yu Mingchuan wrote five letters to the responsible comrades of the Nanling County People's Government, village cadres of Lintan Village, and the principal of Qingyijiang Middle School in Nanling County at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, pleading and defending his elder brother Yu Dingchuan in various ways. Yu Mingchuan even claimed to "bear considerable responsibility within the Party" and used the names of "Communist Party member," the National Finance Review Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union, and "responsible cadre" of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union to threaten local cadres and attack the fighting spirit of the local masses, attempting to achieve his shameful goal of harboring landlords and counter-revolutionary ringleaders.

At the same time, Yu Mingchuan maintained contact with Yu Changhua, a running dog of his elder brother and a Chiang Kai-shek secret agent. Based on the slanderous lies fabricated by Yu Changhua in his letter, claiming that "there are deviations in the land reform in Lintan Village, Nanling County," Yu Mingchuan made incorrect reflections to the Party, requesting the Party organization to "instruct the Southern Anhui region to investigate."

Yu Mingchuan's behavior in losing the stance of a Communist Party member has reached an alarming level, seriously undermining the Party's prestige among the masses.

After Yu Mingchuan's mistakes were exposed, although he admitted that he "was equivalent to harboring" his elder brother, he still quibbled, saying that his "subjective motive was not to harbor." Regarding his elder brother's major bloody crimes, Yu Mingchuan only vaguely said: "The puppet county government did many bad things... Of course, he must have known a lot."

Yu Mingchuan, as a Communist Party member, a people's teacher, and one of the responsible cadres of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union, not only failed to resolutely support the peasants in the great land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement but instead completely stood on the side of the landlord class, openly acting as a spokesman for counter-revolutionaries, harboring landlords and counter-revolutionary ringleaders, and attacking the fighting spirit of the masses. His position and views have nothing in common with the Party's position and views. He is a class alien who infiltrated the Party.

The Peking University Party Committee held a党员大会 (Party member's congress) on October 7th (and invited non-Party professors, students, and staff to participate). The responsible comrade of the Party committee reported on the process of Yu Mingchuan's mistakes, pointing out that his mistakes were serious and should be subject to Party discipline. All the comrades present agreed with the Party Committee's correct analysis of Yu Mingchuan's problem and unanimously demanded that the Party organization give him severe punishment.

In order to maintain the purity of the Party ranks, the Peking University Party Committee decided to expel Yu Mingchuan from the Party. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has approved this decision and issued a decision on October 11th to expel Yu Mingchuan from the Party.

### 北京大学副教授、共产党员俞铭传包庇反革命首恶被开除党籍

    北京大学副教授、共产党员
    俞铭传包庇反革命首恶被开除党籍
    北京大学西方语文系副教授俞铭传（共产党员）在土地改革和镇压反革命运动中丧失立场，包庇地主、反革命首恶，已被开除党籍。
    俞铭传是安徽省南陵县麟谭村人，地主家庭出身。现年三十六岁。武汉大学外国语文系毕业，清华大学研究院毕业。一九四八年三月混入中国共产党。解放后，曾任北京大学讲师、助教联合会主席、校务委员会常务委员，中国教育工会北京市委员会办公室主任等重要职务。在皖南地区解放以前，他曾给他的大哥俞鼎传写信，怂恿他变卖土地，以逃避土地改革斗争；解放以后，又数次写信给他的大哥，叫他变卖农具什物，并数次动员他外出工作，以逃脱人民对他的制裁。
    俞鼎传是一个什么人物呢？他是皖南区南陵县麟谭村的恶霸地主、反革命首恶（现已被枪决）。他过去一贯进行反革命活动：策划“清剿”我敌后游击部队，杀害我县委副书记、营长等革命干部及群众七、八十人。并向农民强行倒租、征实、征购、勒索巨款；抓丁拉夫近千名。人民解放军渡江前夕，他藏匿和焚毁重要档案、文件，以掩盖其血腥罪行。人民解放军解放该地以后，他继续与人民为敌，破坏和诬蔑伟大的土地改革运动。一九五○年十二月，由于群众纷纷告发，为人民政府所逮捕。
    俞铭传在俞鼎传被人民政府逮捕以后，于去年年底和今年年初给南陵县人民政府的负责同志和麟谭村村干部、南陵县青弋江中学校长等先后写了五封信，多方为他的大哥俞鼎传说情辩解。俞铭传并且自称“在党内负着相当的责任”，用“共产党员”、中国教育工会全国经费审查委员会、中国教育工会北京市委员会“负责干部”的名义，威胁当地干部，打击该地群众的斗争情绪，企图以此达到其包庇地主、反革命首恶的可耻目的。
    同时，俞铭传还和他大哥的狗腿子、蒋匪特务俞昌华保持着联系。俞铭传曾根据俞昌华给他的信中所捏造的“南陵县麟谭村土地改革有偏差”的诬蔑人民的谰言，向党作了不正确的反映，要求党组织“指示皖南区调查”。
    俞铭传所表现的丧失共产党员立场的行为已经到了惊人的地步，严重地破坏了党在群众中的威信。
    俞铭传的错误被揭发以后，他虽然承认“等于包庇”了他的大哥，但是仍然强词辩解，说“主观动机并不是包庇”。对于他大哥的重大血腥罪行，俞铭传只是含混地说：“伪县政府做过许多坏事……当然他知道的一定不少。”
    俞铭传身为共产党员、人民教师、中国教育工会北京市委员会的负责干部之一，在伟大的土地改革和镇压反革命运动中不但不坚决地支持农民，反而完全站在地主阶级立场，明目张胆地充当反革命分子的代言人，包庇地主和反革命首恶分子，打击群众的斗争情绪。他的立场、观点和党的立场、观点毫无共同之点。他是混入党内的阶级异己分子。
    中共北京大学党委于十月七日召开了党员大会
    （并邀请非党员的教授、同学、职工参加），由党委负责同志报告俞铭传犯错误的经过，指出他的错误是严重的，应受到党纪的处分。到会的全体同志同意党委对俞铭传问题的正确分析，一致要求党的组织给他以严厉处分。
    为了保持党的队伍的纯洁性，中共北京大学党委决定开除俞铭传的党籍，中共北京市委纪律检查委员会已批准这一决定，并于十月十一日发布了关于开除俞铭传党籍的决定。
