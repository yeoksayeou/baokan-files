    Leading Cadres of Shanxi Provincial Construction Company
    Should Promptly Examine Bureaucratic Work Style
    To the Editor: Leading cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Construction Company have a serious bureaucratic work style and have repeatedly blindly employed corrupt elements, causing losses to the people's property. Last winter, the company's administrative department, without any review, employed Hou Bingren and Cao Shifu, two staff members who had been dismissed by other organizations. This February, Hou Bingren absconded with 5 million yuan of public funds while purchasing stones. Cao Shifu absconded with various surveying instruments this April when surveying the site for the Second Machine Branch Factory of the Xutan Kiln General Factory, causing the company a loss of more than 7 million yuan. After the above incidents occurred, the leading cadres did not pay attention to them, and then appointed corrupt element Xi Linqing (landlord component) as the captain of the Second Engineering Team. Xi Linqing arbitrarily allocated the team's three workers' dormitories to the feudal foreman Liu Jie, forcing the workers to have no place to live. Xi Linqing also often gave public tools and materials to Liu Jie as bribes to build relationships. The workers discussed this matter a lot, but the leading cadres of the Construction Company still did not take any action.

    山西省建筑公司领导干部
    应迅速检查官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：山西省建筑公司领导干部有严重官僚主义作风，一再盲目录用腐化分子，使人民财产受到损失。去年冬季，公司行政方面没有经过审查，就录用了被其他机关开除的职员侯秉仁和曹世福两人。今年二月，侯秉仁出外采购石头，携带公款五百万元潜逃；曹世福在今年四月到许坛测量窑业总厂第二机器分厂地址时，携带各项测量仪器潜逃，使公司损失了七百多万元。以上事件发生后，领导干部并不重视，接着又派腐化分子郄淋清（地主成份）当第二工程队队长。郄淋清把这个队的三间工人宿舍擅自拨给封建把头刘杰，迫得工人们没房居住。郄淋清并常常拿公家工具、材料乱送给刘杰，联络感情。工人们对这件事议论纷纷，但建筑公司领导干部依然不作处理。    张述德    侯培德
