    Qiqihar District Committee of the Chinese Railway Union:
    Bureaucracy of Leading Cadres Causes Waste
    Editor: The leading cadres of the Qiqihar District Committee of the Chinese Railway Union have serious bureaucratic work styles, causing great waste. When staff and workers launched cultural studies the year before last, the Culture and Education Department of the District Committee distributed textbooks to various sub-district committees but did not supervise the sub-district committees to collect payments from the staff and workers afterwards. As of the November statistics this year, more than 21 million yuan has become uncollectible. When the District Committee held a sports meet last year, it made eighty sets of parallel bars and uneven bars. After they were made, they were placed in the railway middle school and no one was responsible for their safekeeping. This year, when the sports meet was held and these items were needed, only thirty sets remained, resulting in a loss of more than 9 million yuan. Staff at the staff and worker club's shop often lose money. It is estimated that 2.7 million yuan was lost from February to October this year. Leading cadres neither investigate nor deal with these matters. When workers apply for subsidies, the person in charge of the Labor Protection Department approves them casually without any analysis or investigation. It was discovered that there were 2,800 work points of improper subsidies, wasting more than 4.9 million yuan. In the future, the leading cadres of the District Committee should pay attention to conservation and correct this irresponsible bureaucratic work style.

    中国铁路工会齐齐哈尔区委员会
    领导干部官僚主义造成浪费
    编辑同志：中国铁路工会齐齐哈尔区委员会的领导干部，官僚主义作风严重，造成很大浪费。前年职工展开文化学习时，区委员会文教部把课本分发给各分区委员会，事后也没有督促各分区委员会向职工收款；到今年十一月统计，有二千一百多万元已收不上来了。去年区委员会举办运动会时，做高低栏八十副，做完就放在铁路中学，没有人负责保管。今年举行运动会，要用这些东西，只剩了三十副，损失了九十多万元。职工俱乐部小卖店工作人员时常丢款，估计从今年二月到十月就丢了二百七十万元，领导干部对这些事都不追究，也不处理。劳动保护部负责人每逢工人申请补助费时，毫不加以分析调查，就随便盖章批准，经发觉不应补助的有二千八百工分，浪费了四百九十多万元。区委员会领导干部今后应重视节约，纠正这种不负责任的官僚主义作风。    高鹏举
