    Heinous Crimes of American Troops Abusing and Killing Prisoners of War
    By Jin Zhengxi, Head Nurse of the Korean People's Army

    While we were conducting defensive warfare four kilometers in front of Soche-ri, I and the other nurses were busy rescuing the wounded. As we were putting the wounded on stretchers for the third time, skirting the mountainside and turning towards the field hospital, we discovered a small squad of American troops attacking from left and right. Knowing that we medics were few in number, the devils surrounded us and swarmed in like a pack of wolves.

    We didn't have many weapons, but we still tried to fight the enemy. I and six nurses put the stretchers on the ground and resisted the American beasts, who pounced on us like wolves, with the determination to die. As I was about to strike a group of beasts attacking from the front, I suddenly felt a heavy blow to my head, as if struck by a club, and lost consciousness.

    I don't know how long it was, but I vaguely opened my eyes, and it was already sunset. I looked around and saw that the nurses were all tightly bound to the ground with telephone wires, and the room was covered in blood. As soon as the American devils who were eating saw that I had regained consciousness, two of them came over and beat me severely. Blood flowed from my face, and my ears seemed to be torn.

    A guy who seemed to be the squad leader ordered his men to gather our comrades who had died from their wounds in one place, and to bring us there as well. One devil spat on the faces of these martyrs, and we were extremely angry when we saw this, our hearts about to burst. The devil grinned and, in front of us, stabbed each body fiercely with a bayonet. One comrade was not completely dead, and his body was still wriggling. The devil dragged him out and stabbed him repeatedly with bayonets, finally tearing apart his limbs. We were filled with rage when we saw this scene, almost ready to explode.

    One of our comrades was so enraged that she couldn't bear it any longer and raised her pale face, shouting, "You dogs! Remember, you will have to pay for your blood debts one day!" The devils immediately dragged her out, stripped her naked, tied her to a tree, subjected her to all kinds of insults, and then cut her open with a knife from her upper body to her lower body in a straight line. The spasms caused by the nerves that had not completely died made this group of beasts laugh gleefully. After that, we were escorted to a campsite. Each of us was beaten to the point of near death and unable to walk.

    That night, we were forced to walk more than thirty *li* under a rain of fists and feet, stopped, and were imprisoned in a resident's house in a valley. The devils drove everyone out of the house and imprisoned us in the back room, standing guard. The door was already gone, and we could see the situation outside. We saw the American bandits pointing their guns at the owner of the house, who was over sixty years old, and threatening him to bring out chicken and wine. The old man couldn't produce chicken and wine, and the beastly devils grabbed the old man's neck and fired two shots at his ears with a pistol. Then, this group of murderers angrily shouldered their guns and went out to rob and plunder.

    Soon, this group of devils came back drunk, leading eleven male and female civilians triumphantly. Because these people couldn't produce chicken and wine, they were arrested by the devils and locked up with us. After a while, the clamoring devils dragged the men to the front yard, lined them up, and shot them all. Then, the beasts dragged the women away one by one. After four village women were dragged away, none of them returned. Three of our comrades were also dragged away. One of the comrades was shot on the spot for resisting the devils. The other two comrades were dragged into the front room in a state of mental confusion. After a while, the tragic cries of the comrades echoed from that room, shaking the night sky.

    I tried my best to find a way to escape this living hell, but couldn't find an opportunity. After some time, the devils got drunk and fell asleep one after another. The guy on guard paced back and forth for a while, and finally sat on the doorstep and fell asleep. This was about three o'clock in the morning.

    At this moment, the sound of carbines suddenly came from outside. "Hands up!" The strong voice of the People's Army was also heard. It was our People's Army night raid team.

    Our raid team wiped out all the enemies. Our joy cannot be described in words. In the morning, we searched the surroundings of the house and found that the four village women who had been dragged away last night had all been buried alive in the trenches in front after being raped by the devils.

    Now, whenever I think of the atrocities of the American beasts at that time, I hate them to the core; if we don't wipe out the American beasts, we can't even think of living a peaceful life.

    In the future, I must wage a more resolute struggle against the American beasts and avenge the comrades who fell with hatred.

    美军虐杀俘虏的万恶罪行
    朝鲜人民军护士长　金正喜
    当素在里前面四公里的地方进行防御战的时候，我和其他护士们正忙于救护伤员。在我们第三次把伤员放上担架，绕过山边，拐弯到军医所去的时候，发现有一小队左右的美军来袭。鬼子们知道我们卫生兵人数不多，对我们采取包围形势，像狼群一样，蜂拥地围了上来。
    我们没有很多武器，但仍然设法和敌人搏斗。我和六名护士把担架放在地上，用必死的决心抵抗像狼群般扑来的美国野兽。当我正要打击从正面扑来的一群野兽时，突然我的头部，似乎着了棍棒的重击，就失去知觉，不省人事了。
    不知过了多少时候，我朦胧地睁开眼睛，这时已是日落西山的黄昏时分。我向四面一看，看到护士们都被电话线紧紧地捆倒在地，房间里满地是鲜血。正在吃饭的美国鬼子一知道我已恢复知觉，有两个家伙就走过来抓着我痛打，我的脸上流着血，耳朵似乎也裂开了。
    一个好像是小队长的家伙，吩咐部下把因伤重死去的我们的同志集中在一处，并且把我们也带到那里。一个鬼子向这批牺牲者脸上吐痰，我们看到这种情形，愤怒极了，心胸欲裂。这个鬼子却狞笑着，当着我们的面前，用刺刀狠命地刺进每一个尸体。有一个同志没有完全断气，身体还在蠕动。鬼子就把他拖出来，纷纷用刺刀刺他，最后割裂了他的四肢。我们看到这种情景，心中的怒火几乎要迸发出来。
    我们中间有一位同志激愤得实在忍受不住，不禁抬起苍白的脸，高喊：“狗东西们！记住，你们总有要还清血债的一天！”鬼子们立刻把她拉出来，剥光衣服，捆在树上，对她使尽了种种侮辱后，用刀从上身到下身一直线地剖开。还没有完全死掉的神经所引起的痉挛，使这群野兽得意忘形地笑起来了。以后，我们就被押解到野营地去了。我们每一个都被痛打得奄奄一息，走不动路了。
    那天晚上，我们在拳脚交加之下，走了三十多里路，停下来，被监禁在山谷里的一所居民的房里。鬼子们把房里的人全部逐出，把我们监禁在后面房里，站岗看守着。房门已经掉了，我们看得到外面的情形。我们看到美国强盗用枪对准这屋子的六十多岁的主人，威胁他拿出鸡和酒。这家的老人拿不出鸡和酒，野兽般的鬼子就抓住老人的脖子，对准他的耳朵，用手枪射了两响。然后，这群杀人犯就恶狠狠地扛起枪，四出去抢掠了。
    不久，这群鬼子喝得酩酊大醉，牵了十一个男女平民，得意洋洋地回来了。这些人因为拿不出鸡和酒，就被鬼子们逮捕来和我们关在一起。一会儿，喧嚷着的鬼子们把男子拉到前面院子里，叫他们站成一列，就把他们全部枪杀。接着，野兽们把女子一个一个拉走了。四个乡村女子被他们拉走以后，一个也没有回来。我们同志中间有三个人也被拉走了。其中一个同志因为反抗鬼子，被就地枪杀。其他两位同志在精神昏迷的状态下，被拉进前面的房间。隔些时后，就从那房间里传出了同志们凄惨的叫声，震颤了夜空。
    我尽力想办法脱出这座活地狱，但找不到机会。又过了一些时，鬼子们喝醉了，先后入睡了。站岗的家伙踱来踱去地走了一会，最后也坐在门槛上，睡倒了。这时候大约是清晨三点钟。
    这时，外面突然传来卡宾枪的声音。“举手！”人民军的强有力的声音也听到了。这是我们人民军夜间袭击组来了。
    我们的袭击组消灭了全部敌人。我们的高兴不是言语可以形容的。清晨，我们搜索这房子的周围，发现昨晚被拉走的四个乡村女子，遭鬼子凌辱后，全部被活埋在前面的战壕里。
    现在我一想到那时美国野兽的暴行，就切齿痛恨；我们如不把美国野兽消灭尽，我们就休想过安稳的日子。
    今后，我一定要和美国野兽作更坚决的斗争，为抱恨而倒下去的同志们复仇。
