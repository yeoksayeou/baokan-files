Shanxi Province launched an unprecedented large-scale competition movement to provide preferential treatment to military families by cultivating their land, resulting in a widespread bumper harvest in the areas where land was cultivated on their behalf. Yaoshanggou Village (Wuxiang County), which initiated the land cultivation competition for military families across the province, and other villages such as Dalinkou Village in Zuoquan County and Yongwan Village in Gaoping County, created new records for high yields on land cultivated on behalf of military families. Yaoshanggou Village deeply carried out patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which enhanced the enthusiasm of the masses for cultivating land on behalf of military families; implemented a system of contracted work and output, and assigned specific personnel to be responsible, which stimulated the initiative of the masses in cultivating land on behalf of military families; and implemented a method of regular inspection, summary, and evaluation to ensure the regular continuation of land cultivation work on behalf of military families. The average yield of the one hundred and twelve mu of autumn land cultivated on behalf of military families in the entire village reached 1.75 shi (one shi equals 10 dou) per mu, exceeding the expected yield of 9 dou per mu by 8.5 dou; compared with the actual yield of 1.38 shi per mu last year, it increased by 3.7 dou; exceeding the average yield of 1.7 shi per mu of ordinary farmers in the whole village by 0.5 dou; and exceeding this year's planned increase per mu by 1 dou.

    代耕地创丰产新纪录
    山西全省曾展开空前大规模的优军代耕竞赛运动，代耕地区普遍丰收。向全省各村发起代耕竞赛的生产模范村窑上沟村（武乡县）及左权县大林口村、高平县雍万村等村更创造了代耕地丰产新纪录。窑上沟村曾深入开展抗美援朝爱国主义教育，提高了群众代耕情绪；实行了包工包产和专人专责制度，启发了群众代耕积极性；执行了随时检查总结评比办法，保证了代耕工作的经常化。全村代耕的一百一十二亩秋地，平均产量达一石七斗五升，较每亩应产量九斗超过八斗五升；与去年每亩实产量
    一石三斗八升相较，增产了三斗七升；较全村一般农民每亩平均产量一石七斗超过了五升；较今年每亩增产计划超过一斗。    （山西日报）
