Ma Deyi from Majia Street, Jin County, Liaoxi, is 53 years old this year. He was originally a farmhand who worked for landlords for 25 years. After the land reform, he was allocated a house and eighteen mu of alkaline land. These lands yielded very little grain over the years, but because he was given land, his enthusiasm for production was very high, and he was determined to reverse this situation. His method was to wash the alkali with water and then add a layer of black soil. In 1949, he harvested 1.8 shi of grain.

In 1950, he harvested 11 shi. This year, he also tried planting some cotton and kenaf, and the combined harvest totaled 15 shi of grain, which is more than seven times higher than two years ago.

    辽西锦县马德义努力改造碱地
    今年比前年增产粮食七倍多
    辽西锦县马家街马德义，今年五十三岁，原是雇农出身，曾给地主扛过二十五年活。土地改革后，他分得了房子和十八亩碱地。这些地历年收粮食很少，但他因为分得地，生产情绪很高，决心扭转这种情况。他的办法是用水洗碱，洗过以后再垫一层黑土。这样他在一九四九年就收了一石八斗粮，
    一九五○年收到十一石，今年他还试种了一部分棉花和洋麻，合起来的收成折粮十五石，足足比前年增产了七倍多。　张　蓬
