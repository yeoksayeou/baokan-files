Strengthen Winter Drought Prevention Work to Ensure a Bumper Harvest Next Year!
中共中央华北局财经工作委员会农林水利处 (Economic and Financial Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Department)

The drought in North China this year has seriously damaged agricultural production. Irrigated land in the entire North China region accounts for only about 10 percent of the cultivated area. Moreover, the annual rainfall is insufficient, and the precipitation is mostly concentrated in July and August. As a result, drought occurs nine years out of ten; severe drought with no rain, and minor drought with little rain. Even when rainfall is normal, spring drought often occurs in most areas. However, the North China region is not without drought prevention conditions. The existing water conservancy facilities have great potential that can be exploited. Wells can be dug for irrigation in most plains areas, and springs can be tapped in mountainous areas to retain mountain floods and store water for use. At the same time, the masses have many years of experience in fighting drought. As long as these conditions are used and developed skillfully, it will be possible to avoid or mitigate drought disasters. In the past, the main shortcomings in drought prevention and resistance work in the North China region have been a lack of preparation and planning, often resorting to digging wells at the last minute during a drought. Therefore, although disasters could be mitigated, the losses were still significant. Therefore, it is necessary to start now and make planned preparations for drought prevention and resistance. This is an important part of ensuring a bumper harvest next year.

What drought prevention work should be done this winter?

First, universally implement winter plowing to accumulate snow, store water, and nourish the soil. All regions must ensure that "plowing does not stop while the ground is not frozen." Cotton-producing areas must mobilize cotton farmers to remove cotton stalks early and clear the fields for plowing. Disaster-stricken areas must lead farmers to resolve the contradictions between agricultural and sideline production and the difficulties in manpower and animal power, to ensure that all bare land is plowed once.

Second, vigorously promote winter irrigation. Use existing canals and wells to irrigate wheat fields and bare land once. This will greatly help increase wheat production next year, prevent pests, and ensure spring plowing and sowing. In the past, many areas did not have the habit of winter irrigation; although some areas had the habit of winter irrigation, they only irrigated wheat seedlings and not bare land. Therefore, winter irrigation should be promoted in areas with irrigation conditions. When irrigating wheat, pay attention to the amount of water to prevent excessive freezing and damage to wheat seedlings.

Third, universally call for planting ridges on leeward slopes in dry land to accumulate snow, and mobilize people in areas along rivers and lakes to store large amounts of water and ice (when the upper layer of river water freezes solid, make holes in the ice, and block the flow of water below with grass, so that the river water rises to the ice, and the ice layer gradually thickens. After thawing, it can be used to irrigate the land).

Fourth, universally dig water storage ponds. This is very beneficial for drought prevention, flood control, sand interception, and siltation of land, and it is simple and easy to implement. There are nearly 400,000 reservoirs in North China that can store more than one million cubic meters of water, but this is far from enough. The masses should be mobilized to help each other and cooperate to renovate existing reservoirs and dig new ones in a planned way.

In addition to the above methods, different drought prevention measures can be taken according to the natural conditions of different regions:

First, strengthen the management of existing canals and wells to expand the benefited area. There are more than 4,000 large and small canals in North China. Except for a few larger canals that have improved engineering equipment and organized reasonable water use, the general canals still have extremely unreasonable phenomena in terms of engineering equipment, water distribution methods, and organization management. Furthermore, because some leading cadres attach importance to engineering and neglect management, and some people and some district and village cadres have localism ideas, the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena have not been thoroughly corrected. The management of canal and well irrigation in various places is even more neglected, so that existing canals and wells cannot exert their due effectiveness. A well-managed canal can irrigate 15,000 mu of land per unit of flow; a poorly managed canal can only irrigate 4,000 mu. A well managed well with mutual aid and cooperation can irrigate 20 to 50 mu; a poorly managed well with individual households can only irrigate about 10 mu. If management can be strengthened and reasonable water use can be achieved, existing canals and wells can expand the irrigated area by one-fourth to one-third. Therefore, all localities must, on the one hand, correct the ideas of emphasizing engineering and neglecting management and localism; on the other hand, establish and improve water conservancy management institutions at all levels, strengthen democratic management, and organize the masses to help each other and cooperate to rationally utilize existing wells and cooperate in digging wells to achieve equal value and mutual benefit, in order to expand the irrigated area.

Second, develop water sources. Universally developing well irrigation is an effective drought resistance method that is feasible in most areas. Seventy percent of the plains areas in North China can dig wells, and the water level is generally around 2.5 zhang. In order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor and capital and scattered land, mutual assistance can be widely mobilized to dig wells. In addition to developing the brick kiln industry to make more brick wells, we should also promote the methods of using stone, lime, and Zhijie grass to replace bricks to build wells in various places. Using these methods to dig wells is extremely cheap, simple and easy to implement, and has a great effect on increasing production and preventing drought. Some areas have many wells but insufficient water sources. The main task in these areas is to draw water from the lower water springs to give full play to the effectiveness of the wells.

While developing wells, it is necessary to solve the difficulty of water extraction tools. Of the more than 300,000 wells in the plains, only more than 180,000 have waterwheels or windlasses. Therefore, the effectiveness of the wells cannot be fully utilized. To solve the difficulty of water extraction tools, it is necessary to solve it from two aspects: first, lead local industry and handicrafts to produce more waterwheels, and the government should assist in uniformly solving the difficulties of raw materials; second, improve and manufacture the simple water extraction tools originally used by the masses, such as windlasses, booms, and water buckets, to supplement the lack of waterwheels.

In addition, opening canals to divert water is also a major method of developing water sources. Therefore, attention should be paid to leading the masses to open up more small canals.

Third, areas lacking water sources must start from improving and utilizing natural conditions, improving and enhancing cultivation techniques, and planting more drought-resistant crops. In addition to using methods such as accumulating snow, storing ice, and digging reservoirs to preserve and utilize natural water sources as much as possible, the methods that can be adopted are: 1. Plow the land once after autumn, harrow more before spring sowing, and hoe more after sowing to maintain soil moisture and reduce evaporation. 2. Grasp the spring sowing season, check the soil moisture, take advantage of soil moisture, and sow in time. The experience of drought-resistant sowing in Hebei this spring proves that this is a good way to seize the time to complete sowing in the absence of rain. In areas with little rainfall in Inner Mongolia, Chahar North, and Suiyuan, where the crop growing season is short, it is also possible to appropriately advocate early planting. 3. Make full use of the existing small amount of water and effectively use it for sowing and seedling protection. Such as carrying water, pulling water for spot planting, and using soaked corn stalks and sorghum stalks to insert in the soil to resist drought and protect seedlings. 4. In overly arid areas, plant deep-rooted drought-resistant crops such as wheat and potatoes. 5. Prepare a large number of various seeds for replanting and supplementary planting at any time.

There are many ways to prevent drought. To truly implement these methods, leading agencies at all levels must make all preparations this winter, such as training cadres and technicians, rectifying the organizational management of canals and wells, and manufacturing waterwheels in large quantities. At the same time, we must also educate cadres and the masses to pay attention to drought prevention work by printing "Drought Prevention Manuals" and conducting drought prevention education in winter schools; mobilize everyone to discuss specific drought prevention methods as early as possible, formulate specific drought prevention plans at all levels, and carry out mass drought prevention movements.

    加强冬季防旱工作，保证明年农业丰产！
    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会农林水利处
    华北今年的旱灾，使农业生产受到严重损失。华北全区现有水田仅占耕地面积约百分之十，而且常年雨量不足，降雨时间又多集中在七、八两月，因而十年九旱，没雨大旱，少雨小旱；即使雨水正常，大部地区也常发生春旱。但华北地区并不是没有防旱条件的，现有的水利设备还有很大潜在能力可以发挥，大部平川地区可以打井灌溉，山区可以开挖泉水，留截山洪，储水备用，同时群众又有多年抗旱斗争经验。只要善于运用和发挥这些条件，就能做到避免旱灾，或减轻旱灾。历年来华北地区在防旱抗旱工作中的主要缺点，是缺乏准备和计划，往往临旱掘井，临时突击。所以，虽能减轻灾害，但损失仍然很大。因此，必须从现在开始，有计划地做好防旱抗旱准备工作。这是保证明年农业丰产的重要环节。
    今年冬天要做那些防旱工作呢？
    第一、普遍实行冬耕，以便积雪蓄水养墒。各地要做到“地不冻，犁不停”；产棉区要动员棉农早拔棉棵腾茬耕地；受灾地区要领导农民解决农、副业生产的矛盾和人力、畜力困难，保证把白地普遍耕一遍。
    第二、大力开展冬浇。利用现有水渠、水井，把麦田和白地普浇一遍，这对来年小麦增产、防除虫害和保证春耕播种都有很大作用。过去不少地区群众都没有冬浇习惯；某些地区虽有冬浇习惯，但只浇麦苗不浇白地。因此，在有浇地条件的地区，都应注意提倡冬浇。浇麦时应注意水量不要过大，以防结冰过厚，冻坏麦苗。
    第三、普遍号召旱地背风起垅积雪；并发动沿河、沿湖地区大量储水养冰（在河水上层冻结坚固时，在冰上打洞，用草堵塞下面流水的去路，使河水冒到冰上，冰层逐渐加厚，解冻后就可以用它浇地）。
    第四、普遍挖蓄水池。这对防旱、防洪、拦沙、淤地都很有好处，而且简便易行。华北地区现有蓄水池近四十万个，能贮水一百多万立方公尺；但还远不够用，应发动群众互助合作，有计划地修整原有的蓄水池和增挖新的蓄水池。
    除以上办法外，还可以根据不同地区的自然条件，分别采取不同的防旱措施：
    第一、加强现有渠道、水井的管理，扩大受益面积。华北共有大小渠道四千多条，其中除少数较大渠道已改善工程设备、组织合理用水外，一般渠道在工程设备、分水办法、组织管理等方面还有极不合理的现象。更由于某些领导干部重工程、轻管理，某些群众和部分区、村干部有本位主义思想，以致上述不合理现象没有彻底纠正。各地对水渠、水井灌溉的管理，更是忽视，以致现有水渠、水井也不能发挥应有的效力。管理较好的渠道，一个流量能浇地一万五千亩；管理不好的只能浇四千亩。互助合作管理得好的水井，每眼能浇二十亩到五十亩；管理不好的、单干户的水井，每眼只能浇十亩左右。如果能加强管理，做到合理用水，现有渠道水井就能扩大浇地面积四分之一到三分之一。因此，各地必须一方面纠正重工程、轻管理和本位主义思想；一方面要建立和健全各级水利管理机构，加强民主管理，并组织群众互助合作，合理利用现有水井，合作打井，做到等价互利，以扩大灌溉面积。
    第二、开发水源。普遍发展水井灌溉，这是大部地区可行的有效抗旱办法。华北平川地区百分之七十可以打井，水位一般在二丈五尺左右。为了克服群众劳力、资力不足和土地分散的困难，可以广泛发动互助打井。除发展砖窑业以多打砖井外，还应发扬各地用石头、石灰、知节草代砖砌井的办法。用这些办法打井，费用极小，简便易行，对增产防旱作用很大。有的地区水井虽多而水源不足。这种地区主要是要引取下层水泉，以充分发挥水井的效用。
    和发展水井同时，必须解决汲水工具的困难。平原三十多万眼水井，只有十八万多眼有水车或辘轳，因此，不能充分发挥水井效用。要解决汲水工具的困难，必须从两方面解决：一是领导地方工业和手工业多生产水车，并由政府协助统一解决原料困难；一是改良和制造群众原有简单汲水工具，如辘轳、吊杆、水斗等，以补助水车的不足。
    此外，开渠引水，也是开发水源的一个主要方法。因此，应注意领导群众多开挖小型渠道。
    第三、缺乏水源的地区，必须从改善和利用自然条件、改进和提高耕作技术、多种耐旱作物等方面着手。除用积雪、储冰、挖蓄水池等方法尽量保存和利用天然水源以外，可以采取的办法是：一、秋后普遍耕一遍，春播前多耙，下种后多锄，以保持土地水分，减少蒸发。二、抓紧春播季节，查验墒土，趁墒、借墒，及时下种。河北今春抗旱播种的经验证明，这是在没雨缺雨情况下，争取时间完成播种的好办法。在内蒙、察北及绥远雨量缺少的地区，作物生长期短，还可以适当提倡早种。三、尽量利用现有的微少水量，有效地用于下种和保苗。如担水、拉水点种，用浸透的玉茭秆、高粱秆插在土里抗旱保苗等。四、过于干旱地区，可多种深根耐旱作物，如小麦、马铃薯等。五、大量准备各种种籽，以备随时改种、补种。
    防旱的办法是很多的。要真正能够实行这些办法，各级领导机关必须在今冬做好一切准备工作，如训练干部与技术人员、整顿水渠水井的组织管理、大量制造水车等。同时还要用印发“防旱手册”和在冬学进行防旱教育等方法，教育干部、群众重视防旱工作；发动大家及早讨论出防旱的具体办法，逐级订好防旱的具体计划，开展群众性的防旱运动。
