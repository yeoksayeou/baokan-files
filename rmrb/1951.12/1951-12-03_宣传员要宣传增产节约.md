Party Life Brief Commentary

    Strengthening the propaganda work of increasing production and practicing thrift is the current main task of the Party's propagandists. In the Northeast region, Party organizations have already paid attention to giving play to the role of propagandists in carrying out the movement to increase production and practice thrift, thus playing a certain role in promoting the progress of the movement. However, the phenomenon of neglecting the propaganda of increasing production and practicing thrift still exists. According to the Songjiang Daily, the propaganda and mobilization work in most state-owned factories in Harbin is nominal, which has affected the development of the movement to increase production and practice thrift. Some blackboard newspapers in the city's egg products company even have propaganda materials such as "A Fly's Autobiography." This shows that the Party's propaganda work there is completely divorced from the current political tasks.

    Increasing production and practicing thrift are the central tasks of the people of the whole country and a long-term policy for us to accumulate funds and build a great motherland. To accomplish this task, we must carry out a mass movement to increase production and practice thrift. Only when the masses consciously devote themselves to this movement and give play to their initiative and creativity in the movement can the Party's policies and propositions be fully realized. In order to mobilize the masses, the Party committee must systematically use the propaganda network organization and give play to the strength of reporters and propagandists. Party branches in various organs, units, factories, mines, enterprises, and rural areas should conscientiously organize propagandists to study documents related to increasing production and practicing thrift and study effective propaganda methods. All kinds of propaganda tools should be used to serve the central task of increasing production and practicing thrift. Propagandists can adopt methods such as the "contract system" and "division of labor and responsibility for publicizing specific targets" to carry out their work, so that everyone understands the principles of patriotic production increase and thrift, and mobilize the people to take active action and strive to realize Chairman Mao's great call for increasing production and practicing thrift.

    宣传员要宣传增产节约
    加强增产节约的宣传工作，是党的宣传员当前的主要任务。东北地区在开展增产节约运动中，党的组织已经注意到发挥宣传员的作用，因而对推动运动的前进起了一定作用，可是，忽视宣传增产节约的现象仍然存在。据松江日报报道：哈尔滨市大部分国营工厂的宣传鼓动工作有名无实，以致影响了增产节约运动的开展。该市蛋品公司有些黑板报上还写着“苍蝇自述”等宣传材料。这说明那里的党的宣传工作和当前的政治任务是完全脱节的。
    增加生产、厉行节约是全国人民当前的中心任务，也是我们积累资金，建设伟大的祖国的长期政策。要完成这个任务，必须开展群众性的增产节约运动。只有群众自觉地投入这个运动，并在运动中发挥他们的积极性和创造性，党的政策主张才能完全实现。为了发动群众，党委必须有计划地运用宣传网组织，发挥报告员和宣传员的力量。各机关单位、厂矿企业、农村党的支部应该认真组织宣传员学习有关增产节约的文件，研究有效的宣传办法。各种样式的宣传工具，都应该被运用起来服务于增产节约的中心任务。宣传员可以采用“包干制”、“分工负责宣传一定对象”等办法来进行工作，务使每个人都懂得爱国增产节约的道理，动员人民积极行动起来，为实现毛主席的增产节约的伟大号召而斗争。
