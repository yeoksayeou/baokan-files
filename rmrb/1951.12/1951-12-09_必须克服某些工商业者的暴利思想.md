    It is necessary to overcome the profiteering ideology of some industrialists and businessmen
    Yi He
    Over the past year, industrialists and businessmen in various regions have made significant progress after undergoing patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, actively participating in various patriotic movements. The industrial and commercial sectors in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shenyang, and Xi'an, as well as many small and medium-sized cities, have overfulfilled their pledged donations for aircraft and artillery. When paying business taxes last year and in the first half of this year, many industrial and commercial figures in various cities organized collective tax payment patriotic parades involving thousands to tens of thousands of people. Some industrialists and businessmen voluntarily presented false accounts when paying taxes. In Beijing's Chaoyangmen Caishi grain market, to prevent missed invoicing, they voluntarily organized triple-linked groups to supervise each other, taking responsibility for the country and the people. This demonstrated the surging patriotic enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen. However, there is also another situation within the industrial and commercial sector, which is that as the economic situation in various regions continues to improve and the market becomes increasingly prosperous, the profiteering ideology of some industrialists and businessmen has become more serious. This profiteering ideology is manifested in the following aspects:
    1. Attempting to evade the leadership of the state-owned economy, such as being unwilling to accept state processing orders, or raising processing fees and using substandard materials in processing orders to seek exorbitant profits. In Kunming City, Yunnan Province, most of the twenty-odd textile factories are unwilling to process for the cotton yarn and cloth company; the Dacheng Flour Mill openly refuses cadres from the grain company to visit the factory to understand the processing situation. When twelve private rubber factories in Tianjin, Beijing, and Qingdao manufactured military raincoats for the state, they reduced quality and increased prices, causing the state to lose over 10 billion yuan. When the Industry Department of the East China Military and Political Committee ordered tea machine parts (louver boards) in Shanghai, the Shanghai Machinery Industry Sixth Joint Association took the opportunity to falsely report prices, exceeding the transaction price by nine times; the Third Joint Association even exceeded the transaction price by twelve times.
    2. Speculating, hoarding, and driving up market prices. For example, Qiu Yuanhong, the owner of the Yongchang Hardware Store on Daming Road in Shanghai, hoarded over 3 billion yuan worth of hardware materials. For the Samsung saw blade alone, there were more than 1,200 gross. However, when Yongchang sold the goods, it used the excuse of a shortage of inventory to change the sales unit of the Samsung saw blade from gross to dozen, stimulating price increases and reaping huge profits. In mid-October, the Shenyang Department Store supplied various types of glass to the Glass Trade Association of the city, totaling more than 4,500 boxes. Many private merchants took the opportunity to drive up market prices, and by late October, the market price of glass in Shenyang was 42% higher than the price of state-owned trading companies.
    3. The phenomenon of tax evasion is quite common. In the first half of this year, the Shanghai Tax Bureau handled more than 44,700 cases of tax evasion. After several rounds of evaluation, key audits still found that the number of tax-evading households accounted for more than 60% of the audited households. From January to September of this year, the Ziheng Factory of the textile industry in Beiguan District, Shenyang, actually paid only 4.13% of the income tax due. In the first random inspection in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, of 46 private industrial and commercial households in six industries, 40 households were found to have tax evasion. In the second random inspection of 195 households, all of them had tax evasion.
    The above-mentioned behaviors of seeking exorbitant profits not only violate national economic policies and harm people's lives, but also hinder the development of legitimate industry and commerce. Launching a struggle against profiteering ideology in the industrial and commercial sector has attracted the attention of the broad masses of people in cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. In September of this year, the first session of the second Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Representative Conference discussed and made a resolution on the tendencies of some industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai to pursue exorbitant profits and attempt to evade the leadership of the state-owned economy. It called on industrialists and businessmen throughout the city to conduct in-depth and widespread study on issues such as the New Democratic economic policy and the development direction of private industry and commerce. After the meeting, under the leadership of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, methods such as special lectures, group discussions, and symposiums were used to conduct studies. In order to organize industrialists and businessmen to study in a planned and organized manner, the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station jointly launched the "Beijing Industrial and Commercial Radio Lecture," which helped everyone study through broadcasting every day. Each district branch of the Federation of Industry and Commerce set up large study groups and study groups. Every two weeks, the Industrial and Commercial Radio Lecture Committee formulated discussion outlines for discussions within the groups. In mid-November, the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce successively held executive committee meetings and liaison meetings of the directors of various industries, focusing on discussing and arranging the study methods for the industrial and commercial sector, calling on industrialists and businessmen throughout the city to earnestly study the various documents of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. When studying the documents, they should combine them with the incidents that have occurred in the city, such as the speculative profiteering of Ren Haiqi, the manager of the private "Shanghai Manufacturers North China Joint Office," and the price gouging and hoarding by the Juyuancheng Rice Mill that disrupted market prices, and conduct in-depth ideological self-examinations in connection with their own business. The Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce also decided to gradually launch a study movement in the city's industrial and commercial sector from late November.

    必须克服某些工商业者的暴利思想
    翼鹤
    一年以来，各地工商业者经过抗美援朝爱国主义教育后，已有很大的进步，热烈地参加了各种爱国运动。北京、上海、天津、武汉、沈阳、西安等市，及不少中小城市的工商界，均超额完成了捐献飞机大炮的认捐计划。在去年和今年上半年缴纳营业税时，许多城市工商界人士，曾组织了数千人至数万人的集体纳税爱国游行。有的工商业者在缴纳税款时，自动拿出假账；北京市朝阳门菜市粮食业，为防止漏开发票，他们自动组织三人的连环小组，互相监督，对国家和人民负责。这表现了工商业者高涨的爱国热情。但是，在工商界中也有着另外一种情况，那就是随着各地经济情况继续好转，市场日趋繁荣，某些工商业者的暴利思想更加严重起来，这种暴利思想表现在以下几方面：
    一、企图逃避国营经济的领导，如不愿接受国家的加工订货，或者在加工订货中，抬高工缴费，偷工减料，以牟取暴利。云南省昆明市二十几家纺织厂，大都不愿为花纱布公司进行加工；大成面粉厂公然拒绝粮食公司的干部到厂了解加工情况。天津、北京、青岛三地的十二家私营橡胶厂，承制国家军用雨衣时，降低质量，提高价格，使国家损失百余亿元。华东军政委员会工业部在上海订制制茶叶机零件——百叶板，上海市机器业第六联营所，乘机谎报价格，超过成交价格的九倍，第三联营所竟超过成交价格十二倍之多。
    二、投机取巧，囤积居奇，哄抬市价。如上海市大名路永昌五金号老板裘元洪等，囤积时值三十余亿元的五金物资。单三星锯条一项，即有一千二百余罗。而永昌号售货时，竟藉口存货缺乏，把三星锯条出售单位改罗为打，刺激价格上涨，从中获取暴利。十月中旬，沈阳市百货公司先后供给玻璃同业公会各种玻璃四千五百余箱，不少私商便乘机哄抬市价，至十月下旬，沈阳玻璃市价竟高于国营贸易公司牌价百分之四十二。
    三、偷税漏税的现象相当普遍。上海市税务局在今年上半年即处理逃税违章案件四万四千七百余件。经几次评议后重点查账时，仍发现漏税户数占被查户百分之六十以上。沈阳北关区纺织业子衡工厂，从今年一月至九月份实纳的所得税只占应纳的百分之四点一三。浙江省温州市第一次抽查了六个行业的四十六户私营工商业户，其中四十户有偷漏税行为。第二次抽查了一百九十五户，全部都有偷漏税行为。
    上述种种牟取暴利的行为，不仅是违犯国家经济政策，危害人民生活，同时也妨碍了正当工商业的发展。在工商界中开展反暴利思想的斗争，这一问题已引起上海、天津、北京等市广大人民的注意。今年九月，上海市第一届第二次工商界代表会议，曾就上海市部分工商业者追求暴利，企图逃避国营经济领导的偏向，进行了讨论并做出决议。号召全市工商业者对新民主主义经济政策及私营工商业发展方向等问题，进行深入普遍的学习。会后，在上海市工商联合会的领导下，采用专题讲演，小组讨论、座谈会等方法进行学习。为了有计划有领导地组织工商业者学习，北京市工商联合会和北京市人民广播电台共同举办“北京工商广播讲座”，每天通过广播帮助大家学习。工商联各区分会设学习大组，学习小组。每两星期由工商广播讲座委员会拟订讨论提纲，在小组内进行讨论。天津市工商联合会于十一月中旬先后召开了执行委员会会议，各行业主任委员联系会议，着重讨论和布置了工商界学习办法，号召全市工商业者认真学习人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的各项文件；在学习文件时，应结合本市发生的私营“上海厂商华北联合办事处”经理任海岐投机倒把牟取暴利，聚源成机米厂抬价惜售扰乱市场物价等事件，联系本身业务，进行深入的思想检查。该市工商联并决定从十一月下旬起，逐步展开全市工商界的学习运动。
