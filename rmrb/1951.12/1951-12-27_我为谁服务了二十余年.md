    For Whom Have I Served for Over Twenty Years
    Liang Sicheng, Head of the Department of Architecture, Tsinghua University

    Three months after the liberation of Beijing, I participated in the construction work of Beijing as an "expert." I was very active in my professional work and have been busy ever since. I also had the opportunity to attend many meetings and listen to many reports, and I thought I was making progress. Because I was busy, I didn't have time to participate in the political studies at Tsinghua University for more than two years. I just read some books on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought sporadically, thinking it was enough. This complacency seriously hindered my progress.

    Recently, after listening to several reports, I began to think, demand to think, and seriously participated in this ideological remolding study for teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities.

    My class origin, family environment, and education have instilled in me two main ideological sources. One is my father’s (Liang Qichao) conservative reformist thought and the idea of ardently respecting the old traditions of our country. The other is the pro-American thought, which developed after entering Tsinghua University and studying in the United States, and still followed the ups and downs of the American "cultural trend" after returning to China.

    Although I have only done teaching and academic research, due to the development of these two thoughts, in the past twenty years, on the one hand, I went to the periphery of the reactionary ruling group and became a tool for them to use; on the other hand, I approached the American imperialist "cultural figures" who invaded China, was courted by the enemy, and served their aggressive policies. The former proves that I have deeply rooted orthodox ideas, and I am not "above politics," but have been supporting the reactionary governments of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie in action, which is to maintain the interests of my own class. The latter proves that the cultural aggression policy of American imperialism is poisonous. It has numbed me and made me develop pro-American thoughts without realizing it. My purely technical views have given the enemy a chance to take advantage of me.

    Looking back, these two thoughts have run through all my actions for a long time. During my middle school years, I unconditionally worshipped American material civilization and unconsciously had a good impression of it. Even during the May Fourth Movement, I never associated the United States with imperialism. During my years at an American university, I came into contact with American "cultural figures." They regarded themselves as "superior" artists, superficially yearned for Europe, ridiculed the fat merchants, and felt that the United States was "superficial." At that time, I also echoed them, and because of my "national consciousness," pride and love for my own culture, I mistakenly thought that I was despising American culture. In fact, I was using the living habits of American "cultural figures" as the standard and became a prisoner of American culture.

    My first job after returning to the motherland was to establish an architecture department at Northeastern University. My purpose at that time was to establish a "foreign-style" architecture department in Chinese universities and train "domestic architects" who imitated Western architecture. I rearranged the courses I learned in the United States, and the designs were still based on European classical and modern architecture. All I tried to do was to add two courses, Chinese architectural history and Chinese painting and sculpture history, hoping to train architects who would be "proficient in both Chinese and Western cultures," be able to compete with "foreign architects" in the market, and serve the "owners." At that time, I was quite proud, thinking that the architecture department of Northeastern University was no less inferior to the architecture departments of American universities, and was even better. This is exactly taking the American standard as my own standard! As for what kind of people the Chinese architectural "owners" were at that time—warlords, bureaucrats, compradors—whether China's basic construction could develop, how China's architectural art should carry forward the traditions of the country, and who it should serve, I never thought about it at all.

    Later, because of the factionalism in the administrative aspect of Northeastern University, I became disgusted with it, resigned from my position, and returned to Beijing, starting my fifteen years of "academic research" at the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture. I studied Chinese architecture, thinking that I was "pioneering" in the field of academic knowledge and that it was a cultural undertaking. My aspiration was to investigate physical objects and research their ages, and to compile a history of Chinese architecture with physical evidence, to serve the Chinese architectural community. Now it seems that this was still starting from the individual. Due to the traditional literati thought, I wanted to be a "knowledgeable person" and have an academic achievement in my profession, which was still a concept of fame; and it included the feudal class thought of "not being ashamed of being the son of a famous father."

    After this thought was put into action, a series of problems occurred later. For example, most of my articles were biased towards archeology, appraisal, and restoration, and I still had not gotten rid of the style of old Chinese literati studying bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings. In the publications I was responsible for editing, on the one hand, I wanted to popularize them to promote the great Chinese architectural system; but on the other hand, I handled many problems too professionally, so-called "cautious and meticulous," maintaining a "high level of academic standards," and not focusing on meeting the requirements of a wider range of readers. As a result, I cultivated myself into a scholarly researcher and joined the "Academia Sinica" at that time. I forgot that the "unscientific" nature of past Chinese architectural literature was precisely because the old literati monopolized inscriptions and other records, and they did not participate in the actual labor of design or construction, did not understand the structure, and only talked nonsense and described things vaguely. Although I consulted old craftsmen and learned some knowledge, if I wrote all this down only for the "scholar-bureaucrat" class to appreciate, what would be the meaning? It would certainly only lead to my later entanglement with the reactionary government.

    Now let me talk about the root of my pro-American thought. The academic research that I wanted to meet the "standard" was just more in line with the tastes of the imperialist cultural aggression policy! At that time, if someone said that my research was precisely the work that catered to the appetite of American "cultural figures," I would not admit it. At that time, I was indeed seriously upholding the dignity of the Chinese academic community: my articles and illustrated books never used English annotations or explanations. But Beijing at that time was a paradise for imperialist cultural spies. Chinese "scholars" who understood English were precisely the targets of their work. The funds of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture mainly relied on the subsidies of the "China Education and Culture Fund Board" and the "Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board"; how could the research results of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture not attract the attention of the comprador directors and cultural spies of various countries? At first, they pulled me to do English "academic lectures" in the name of the "Beiping Art Society," and then even held exhibitions with English explanations. They coveted our photos, images, and textual research data. I felt happy to be noticed by the "international academic community." I held the idea that "academic research has no national boundaries" and thought that this was precisely promoting culture for the motherland. Today, looking back on the past, the facts are clearly displayed here: if China's sovereignty is not guaranteed, this behavior of explaining the essence of our country's cultural relics to imperialist bandits is just opening the door to invite thieves, and will only cause more brutal plunder of our people by imperialism. In the final analysis, I was serving them. But at that time, I could not see this point.

    At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to resist the "cultural cooperation" of Japanese imperialism, I closed the Beijing Society for Research in Chinese Architecture, stored the materials that could not be taken away, and moved to the southwest. At that time, I thought this was a manifestation of patriotic national consciousness. But afterwards, I voluntarily approached American imperialist elements, and developed to the point of losing my position and taking the enemy as a friend. This was precisely the result of this pro-American thought.

    After the victory, I was invited to lecture at Yale University in the United States, and I was very happy at that time. I especially had a good impression of the Dean of the Yale School of Art, because he had indignantly condemned the destruction of the Old Summer Palace in our country by the Anglo-French allied forces. This kind of individual "injustice" was precisely the reason that confused me and prevented me from seeing the aggressive essence of American imperialism. When Princeton University in the United States celebrated its bicentennial, I was invited to participate in the academic seminar, and I also thought it was a "grand event" and felt very decent. I was also awarded an honorary degree at that meeting. One of the topics of this academic seminar was to study "Far East issues," which was to discuss various aspects of China, such as China's social structure, politics, economy, etc., to study how to invade the "Far East." And at that time, the aggravation of my paralysis was directly proportional to the "kindness" and "honor" I received in the United States! Looking back on the pro-American and pro-American feelings at that time, it is really shocking. As for the "honorary title," on the one hand, like some Chinese intellectuals, I felt that it was vanity; but on the other hand, looking at it from an American perspective, I felt that it was precious. In front of my friends at my American alma mater, it seemed that I had a sense of "returning home in glory"! This is the result of American education making me swallow a sugar-coated bullet!

    My pro-American thought was also seriously manifested in another aspect of my professional work. I started studying the architecture of the motherland during my time studying in the United States. I myself did not have a clear position or point of view, so I became a weathercock, swaying with the direction of American reactionary theories. Before 1930, American architecture was dominated by classicism, so I followed suit and focused on the research of classical aspects. After 1930, the situation changed greatly, and I followed suit and accepted their influence, stifling my ability to think independently.

    After 1930, the so-called "cubism," "constructivism," and "functionalism," which had already been popular in European capitalist countries, increased greatly in power in the United States; the reactionary, historically cut-off, tradition-denying, cosmopolitan, and mechanically materialistic theories of "modern art" of various schools were even more rampant. This tendency was in line with individual liberalism, so it became popular. They dismissed classicism with one stroke, ridiculed classical traditions, despised the local environment and national sentiments, and were completely concrete manifestations of cosmopolitanism. Since my thoughts were constantly led by the American "cultural trend," of course, one foot sank first. Their theories paralyzed me and caused problems in my thinking. My years of Chinese architectural research and the proposition of protecting cultural relics were completely contrary to my actual architectural design and completely separated into two unrelated things. At first, I also planned to combine what I had learned with Chinese architecture, hoping to absorb new engineering science and make it serve Chinese-style architecture, and I made some attempts. But soon, both of my feet sank. I also followed the trend at that time and slandered the budding and potentially very developable Chinese-style architecture built with modern engineering as "imitating the classics" and "backward"! I was in Beijing, but I designed and built a completely Western-style "modern style" and regarded myself as a "structural functionalist," thinking that I was "progressive," and this continued until after liberation.

    Another thing also illustrates how pro-American thought dominated my actions. When the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture was unable to continue in 1946, and Tsinghua University contacted me to establish the Department of Architecture, I felt that I needed to go abroad again for "advanced studies." I lost confidence in my ten years of experience and went to transport new dogmas. As a result, I trafficked all kinds of new books on architectural theory and idealistic art theories such as "abstract patterns" to poison students. When criticized by progressive students, I was still not awake and used reactionary theories to answer.

    How did I get involved with the Kuomintang reactionary government? The Kuomintang reactionary government needed to show off its appearance from the Nanjing era, and some "scholars" among the officials became its decorations. At that time, I always had an inexplicable respect for the "cultural academic circle." After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, through those "scholar officials," my entanglement with the reactionary government gradually became unclear. There were many people like me at that time. When I went south, I thought I was "going to the country's difficulties," and I didn't know what I could do in the rear. I only prepared to "support" the Anti-Japanese War for a long time, that is, to support the "government" at that time. When I arrived in the southwest, the funds of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture were almost exhausted, but the colleagues in the society gathered one after another, willing to continue their work. After spending some time in difficulty, I begged for help from the "Academia Sinica," "Central Museum," etc., and finally directly requested subsidies from the puppet Ministry of Education. This began another line of development for me. At that time, the Kong and Chen families in the financial and educational "authorities" had become notorious. I felt that it was humiliating to bend my waist for the five bushels of rice of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture, but I was very troubled. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, with the dual qualifications of a pro-American faction and a technical personnel on the periphery of the "government," I was appointed by the puppet government as the "Deputy Director of the Wartime Cultural Relics Preservation Committee" launched by the United States, and went directly to Zhu Jiahao's door. Because I was eager to protect cultural relics, I felt that this American-sponsored institution was extremely reasonable, and that it was the American's friendly concern for us and a righteous act to urge our corrupt "government," so I gladly went and took charge of the work. Although I was already angry with Chiang Kai-shek himself, it was just anger without action; I still had the illusion of hoping that the "government" would reform. After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the work ended, and I resigned from the above position.

    Here I also want to mention another thing. During the period when I had not left Chongqing to return to the north and Chiang Kai-shek's "government" had returned to Nanjing, Zhu Jiahao suddenly wanted to shamelessly stage another ugly drama of "offering nine tripods," wanting to build a commemorative building for Chiang Kai-shek in the name of the "national cultural and educational circles," and even asked me to discuss the design in person. At that time, the whole country was full of indignation against Chiang Kai-shek. I felt that Zhu's servile flattery was shameful, and I felt that my own nobility had been tarnished. I had a feeling of crying and laughing, so I used the hypocrisy of the petty bourgeoisie and politely declined. After I went abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kuomintang reactionary government telegraphed to appoint me as the Chinese representative of the "United Nations New Building Design Group." This time, although I hesitated for a while, I accepted it. At that time, the student movement was developing in the country, and I realized that it was very undignified to be a representative of the extremely corrupt "government." But I felt that it was an honor to be able to compete with "masters" from various countries in the architectural world and design together. And at that time, I was fascinated by the "most modern" architectural theory, so I still held a humble attitude to participate in the design work.

    In short, I once tried my best to take the essence of the motherland's culture to brag to the enemy, and on the other hand, I transported the enemy's dross—a narcotic like opium—back to poison our next generation of architects.

    Throughout my life, I thought that I loved the country no less than anyone else, had a high degree of national consciousness, was upright in my behavior, and was worthy of the motherland and the people. In this study, I realized that I had failed to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves in the past. I realized that the ideological consciousness of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals always dominated my every move. Everything was for the individual, and I could not see the people. This discovery made me hesitate and painful, but after further in-depth thinking, I understood that since I am here today and consider myself to be serving the people, I must dig out the ideological roots of the past. Everything that is wrong and that cannot be tolerated today must be discarded as a rotten burden. Only in this way can I stand lightly and soberly on the people's position, serve the people, and serve the cause of revolution and construction. This is the fortunate beginning of my new life.

    From this study, I also found a part of my thoughts that accepted the influence of my father's thoughts. I once unconditionally admired my father, but I didn't necessarily know him; now I need to know him even more from the revolutionary standpoint. What I deeply remember is that his sincere and enthusiastic patriotic propaganda once inspired many people's patriotic and national salvation aspirations. But today, it seems that only in the early stage of his reform, for many backward and conservative people, it played a progressive role. After the "Petition of the Examination Candidates," he quickly approached the highest level of feudal lords and bureaucratic classes. What he hoped was to be a Shang Yang or Wang Anshi-style "wise minister" under a "sage ruler." This proves that he has completely stood on the position of the feudal ruling class. The "country" he loved was the "country" of the feudal ruling class, that is, the "country" of landlords and gentry. This is conservative reformist thought, a strong orthodox concept; his monarchical reform has lagged far behind the revolutionary propositions of the Tongmenghui. After the Revolution of 1911, he again maintained the interests of the landlord and gentry class with conservative reformism, so he was able to cooperate with large landlords, warlords, and bureaucrats more than once. He said that he was afraid of bloodshed and chaos, that is, he was afraid of revolution and afraid of the people. After playing a progressive role during the Hundred Days' Reform, his thinking fell behind. I received his patriotic education, but the content of my patriotic thought was petty-bourgeois individualism. He sowed the seeds of carrying forward the cultural traditions of the motherland in my thoughts, and I am forever grateful. But if I do not stand on the national standpoint and the people's standpoint, and do not have critical ability, the content of what I call cultural tradition may also preserve the feudal dross in a general and intact way, such as my respect for the gentry, orthodox concepts, virtuous politics, etc. all belong to this category.

    In his later years, my father traveled around giving lectures. One of his purposes was to win over young people in order to resist the most progressive proletarian revolutionary thought. He cultivated young people's "desire for knowledge," that is, purely technical academic research. He also hoped that intellectuals would learn to take the reformist "socialist" path. All of this deeply influenced me again. My own class consciousness, coupled with that kind of environment, further hindered me from approaching progressive ideas. My worship of Wells and Laski, and my mistaken views on the early Soviet Union of the revolution, were a series of consequences.

    As for the reason why I stayed in Beijing, on the one hand, it was because I had no illusions about the reactionary government, and on the other hand, I had illusions about "socialism." I started from studying the theory of urban planning, and I thought I was a person who supported socialism. I not only agreed with the planned economy, but also hoped that it would be expressed in regional, urban and rural, urban, and residential plans. The "socialism" that I have accepted is the "socialism" chanted by reformists, and I thought that it might be the same thing as the socialism advocated by Marxists. Just as Wells showed in his conversation with Stalin, he thought that the so-called "socialism meant by the Anglo-Saxons" praised in capitalist countries had "ideological connection" and "blood relationship" with Marxism-Leninism. I myself thought that I was close to the Communist Party in thought, so I was willing to stay here and wait for the Communist Party to come. A series of "miracles" shown by the Liberation Army cadres, etc. after the liberation of Tsinghua University excited me. In the early days of liberation, when the People's Government asked me to participate in various meetings, I was sincerely willing to "serve." My own thoughts still contained a strong old concept of "a scholar dies for his confidant," and I had not yet become the "master," let alone the idea of standing on the people's position and serving the people. Many new understandings have gradually been established after more than two years of work and study.

    Such root-digging of mine is to make today's me distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, stand firm, love our people's China, and resolutely demand to serve the people wholeheartedly. But my analysis is not deep enough. This is only a preliminary understanding in the current stage of learning. My problem is far from getting to the bottom of it. I still need to constantly study and transform, and I hope everyone will help me more.

### 我为谁服务了二十余年

专栏：

    我为谁服务了二十余年
    清华大学营建系主任  梁思成
    北京解放后三个月，我以“专家”的资格参加了北京市的建设工作。我对业务工作很积极，一直忙碌到今天。我也得到机会参加许多会议，听过许多报告，自以为很进步。因为忙，清华大学两年多以来的政治学习我都没有时间参加，只是零散地阅读了一些马列主义毛泽东思想的书籍，以为也很够了。这种自满就严重地阻碍了我的进步。
    最近听了几次报告之后，我才开始思索，要求思索，才认真地参加了这次京津高等学校教师思想改造的学习。
    我的阶级出身、家庭环境和所受的教育，给我种下了两种主要思想根源。一种是我父亲（梁启超）的保守改良主义思想和热烈尊崇本国旧传统的思想。一种是进了清华大学又到美国留学，发展到回国后仍随着美国“文化思潮”起落的崇美、亲美的思想。
    我虽然只做过教学和学术研究的工作，但由于这两种思想的发展，我在二十余年中，一方面走到反动统治集团的外围，成了可供它们驱使的工具；另一方面，我又接近了美帝国主义侵略中国的“文化人”，被敌人拉拢，为他们的侵略政策服务。前者证明我有根深蒂固的正统观念，不是“超政治”的，而是在行动上一直拥护封建阶级和资产阶级反动的政府的，也就是维持自己阶级利益的。后者证明美帝国主义的文化侵略政策是毒辣的，它对我起了麻痹作用，使我养成了崇美思想而不自知；我的纯技术观点又恰恰给了敌人以可乘之隙。
    回想起来，这两种思想贯串在我的一切行动中，为时甚久。中学时代我对美国的物质文明无条件地崇拜，不自觉地有好感。就是在五四运动中，我也从来没有把美国同帝国主义联系起来。在美国大学的几年中，我接触了美国“文化人”。他们以“高超”的艺术家自居，表面上向往欧洲，讥笑大腹贾，觉得美国“浅薄”。当时我也附和他们，且因为我的“民族意识”，对本国文化的骄傲和热爱，使我误认自己是鄙视美国文化的。其实，我当时正是以美国“文化人”的生活习惯的标准为标准，成了美国文化的俘虏。
    我回到祖国的第一个工作就是在东北大学创办一个建筑系。我当时的目的，是要在中国的大学里创办一个“洋式”的建筑系，培养模仿西洋建筑的“国货建筑师”。我把在美国所学的课程照排一遍，设计仍以欧洲古典和近代建筑为标准。我所努力的只是增加了中国建筑史和中国绘画雕塑史两门课程，希望培养出来的建筑师会“中外兼长”，能同“洋建筑师”在市场逐鹿，为“业主”服务。我当时还颇自豪，认为东北大学的建筑系比起美国大学的建筑系并无逊色，且青出于蓝。这正是以美国标准为自己的标准！至于中国当时的建筑“业主”是哪一种人——军阀、官僚、买办，中国的基本建设能不能发展，中国的建筑艺术应该怎样发扬光大本国的传统，且都为了谁而服务，更完全没有去想过。
    后来因为东北大学行政方面闹宗派，使我对它起了厌恶之心，辞去职务，回到北京，开始了我此后在中国营造学社十五年的“学术研究”。我研究中国建筑，自以为是在一门学术知识领域中“开荒”，是一种文化事业。我的志愿是调查实物、考证年代。编一部有实物为证的中国建筑史，为中国建筑界服务。现在看来，这还是由个人出发。由于传统的文人思想，使我要做一个“有学问的人”，在本行中有一种学术上的成就，这还是功名观念；且包括着要“不愧为名父之子”的封建阶级思想。
    这个思想见之于行动之后，便发生了以后一系列的问题。例如：我所作专文大多偏向于考古、鉴定、复原的一方面，仍未摆脱过去中国旧文人研究金石书画的作风。我所负责编辑的刊物里，一方面想要通俗化，以宣扬伟大的中国建筑体系；但另一方面却将许多问题处理得过于专门化，所谓“谨严不苟”，维持“高度学术水平”，并不着重于符合较广泛的读者的要求。结果便把自己培养成了学究式的研究员，加入了当时的“中央研究院”。我忘掉了过去中国建筑文献之“不科学”正是由于过去旧文人包办碑文和其他记录，而他们不参加设计或建造的实际劳动，对结构不了解，只信口开河，空洞地描写一套。我虽曾向老匠师们请教，学得了一些知识，如果再把这一切写出，仅供“士大夫”阶级的文人赏玩，那又有什么意义呢？它当然只引致我同反动政府发生后来的瓜葛。
    现在说一说我那崇美思想的根源吧。我所要合乎“标准”的学术研究，就只是更合乎帝国主义文化侵略政策的脾胃而已！当时如果有人说我的研究正是投合美国“文化人”的胃口的工作，我必不承认。当时我的确是认真地坚持中国学术界的尊严：我的专文和图录也未曾用过英文注释或说明。但当时的北京是帝国主义文化间谍的乐园。懂英文的中国“学者”正是他们工作的对象。营造学社的经费主要依靠“中华教育文化基金董事会”和“中英庚款董事会”的补助；营造学社研究的成绩安得不受到买办董事们和各国文化间谍的注意？最初他们以“北平美术社”的名义拉我去做英语的“学术讲演”，更进而办有英文说明的展览会。他们觊觎着我们的照片、图像和文献考证资料。我便以受到“国际学术界”的注意而感到愉快。我抱着“学术不分国界”的思想，以为这正是为祖国宣扬文化。今天再回首往事，事实明明白白地摆在这里：如果中国的主权没有保障，这种向帝国主义匪盗讲解我国文物精华的行为只是开门揖盗，只会引起帝国主义对我国人民更残暴的掠夺。我归根是为他们服务的。但当时我看不见这一点。
    抗日战争初起，我为了抵制日本帝国主义的“文化合作”，将北京的营造学社结束，把带不走的资料存放起来，自己迁到西南。当时我认为这是爱国的民族意识的表现。但此后却自愿地接近了美帝国主义分子，发展到后来，竟丧失立场，以敌为友，正是这崇美思想的结果。
    胜利以后，我被美国耶鲁大学邀请去讲学，当时我是非常高兴的。我对耶鲁艺术院院长尤其有很好的印象，因为他曾愤慨地斥责英法联军破坏我国的圆明园。这种个别“抱不平”的话正是使我糊涂，看不到美国帝国主义侵略本质的原因。美国普林斯顿大学成立二百周年纪念时，我被请去参加学术讨论会，也以为是“躬逢盛典”，十分体面。我在那次会中还被赠授名誉学位。这个学术讨论会上的专题之一正是研究“远东问题”，也就是讨论关于中国各方面的问题，如中国社会结构、政治、经济等等，研究如何侵略“远东”。而当时的我呢，麻痹症的加剧正和我在美国所受到的“亲切”和“荣誉”成了正比例！回想当时的崇美亲美情感，真令人吃惊。对于“荣誉头衔”，我一方面和一部分中国知识分子一样，觉到那是虚荣；但另一方面以美国眼光来看又觉其可贵，在美国母校朋友之前就似乎有“衣锦还乡”之感！这就是美国教育使我吞下糖衣炮弹的结果！
    我的崇美思想还严重地表现在本行工作上的另一方面。我是在美国学习的时代就开始研究祖国建筑的。我自己是没有明确的立场观点的，因而成了墙头草，随着美国反动理论的风向而摇摆。一九三○年以前美国建筑是以古典主义为主流的，我便跟着着重于古典方面的研究。一九三○年以后情形大变，我就也跟着接受他们的影响，窒息了我独立思考的能力。
    一九三○年以后，欧洲资本主义国家中所已流行的所谓“立体派”、“构成派”、“功能派”等在美国的势力大增；各流派的反动的、割断历史的、否认传统的世界主义的和机械唯物的“现代艺术”理论更甚嚣尘上。这种倾向是符合个人自由主义的，所以便盛行起来。他们对于古典便又一笔勾销，讥讽古典传统，蔑视地方环境和民族情感，完全是世界主义的具体表现。我的思想既不断地受着美国“文化潮流”的领导，当然便一只脚先陷下去。他们的理论麻醉了我，使我的思想发生了问题。我已致力数年的中国建筑研究和保护文物的主张便同我的实际建筑设计背道而驰，完全分割为两件互不相干的事。起初我还打算将所学同中国建筑相结合，希望能够吸收新的工程科学，使它为中国式建筑服务，并且做过一些尝试。但是不久，我两只脚都陷下去了。我也就随着当时的风气，污蔑那正在萌芽中的、且很有发展可能的、以现代工程建造起来的中国式建筑为“摹仿古典”，为“落伍”！自己在北京，却设计并建造了完全西洋系统的“现代式”，反以“结构功能派”自居，觉得自己“进步”，这样一直到解放以后。
    另一件事也同样说明崇美思想如何支配着我的行动。当一九四六年营造学社无法继续，清华大学向我接洽创办营建系之后，我就觉得需要再出国去“深造”一番。对自己十余年的经验失去了自信心，而要去搬运新教条，结果我便把各流派建筑理论新书，和“抽象图案”之类的唯心艺术理论全部贩运过来，毒害学生。受到进步学生的批评时，我尚不清醒，还根据反动的理论来作答辩。
    我怎样和国民党反动政府发生关系的呢？国民党反动政府由南京时代起就需要铺张门面，而官员中的某些“学者”也就成为它的点缀品。当时，我对于“文化学术界”一向是有一种莫名其妙的敬意的。抗日战争爆发以后通过那些“学者官”，我同反动政府的瓜葛便逐渐纠缠不清起来。像我这样的人当时是不少的。当我南下时自以为是“赴国难”，并不知道到了后方能做一些什么事，只准备去长期
    “支持”抗日，当然也就是支持那时的“政府”的。到了西南，营造学社的经费已不绝如缕，而社中同人却陆续聚集，愿意继续本身的工作。在困难中度过一些时候，便乞援于“中央研究院”、“中央博物院”等，结果还是直接向伪教育部请求补助。这便开始了我另一直线的发展。当时财政和教育“当局”孔、陈两族已臭名远扬，我觉得为了营造学社的五斗米折腰是忍辱负重，却又甚感烦恼。到了抗日战争末期，我以亲美派和“政府”外围的技术人员的双重资格，被伪政府任命为由美国所发动的“战区文物保存委员会副主任委员”，直接走到了朱匪家骅门下。我因爱护文物心切，对于这个美帝国主义所赞助的机构又觉得极为合理，且认为这是美国对我们的友谊的关心，是督促我们腐败的“政府”的义举，便欣然前往，负责工作。我对蒋匪本人虽已感到愤恨，但只是没有行动的怒；对“政府”还存着希望它改革的幻想。日本帝国主义投降以后，工作结束，我才辞退了上项职务。
    在这里我还要提到另一件事情。在我还未离开重庆北返而蒋匪“政府”已回到南京的期间，朱家骅突然要无耻地再演一出“献九鼎”的丑剧，想以“全国文化教育界”的名义为蒋匪建造纪念建筑，竟找我面谈设计。那时全国已对蒋匪愤慨万分，我觉得朱匪奴颜奉承之可耻，因而感到自己清高之被沾辱，有啼笑皆非之感，便以小资产阶级虚伪的本事，婉言谢绝。我出国之后，国民党反动政府的外交部又去电指派我为“联合国新厦设计团”的中国代表，这次我虽犹豫一阵，却接受了。当时国内学生运动正在开展，我认识到做腐败到极点的“政府”的代表是很不体面的。但我觉得在建筑界中能同各国的“大师”分庭抗礼，在一起设计是荣誉的。而且当时我正醉心于“最现代”的建筑理论，所以还抱着虚心学习的态度去参加设计工作。
    总而言之，我曾一方面把祖国文化的精华尽量拿去向敌人吹嘘，一方面把敌人的糟粕——同鸦片烟一样的麻醉剂——运回来毒害我们下一代的建筑师。
    我一生自以为爱国不后于任何人，有高度的民族意识，行为正直，对得起祖国，对得起人民。在这次学习中，我才认识到我过去是敌我不分的，我才认识到小资产阶级知识分子的思想意识始终支配着我的一举一动，一切为了个人，看不见人民。这个发现，使我彷徨痛苦，但是经过进一步深入的思考，我明白了我今天既在此自认为是为人民服务，就必需挖出过去的思想根源，凡是错误的，今天所不能再容忍的，就必须当烂包袱丢掉。这样我才能轻松、清醒地站在人民立场，为人民服务，为革命和建设事业服务。这正是我的新生命的可庆幸的开始。
    从这次学习中，我也寻找到我的思想中接受父亲思想影响的一部分。我曾无条件地崇拜父亲，但并不见得认识他；现在我就更需要从革命的立场观点来认识他。我所深刻记忆着的，是他的真挚热情感人至深的爱国宣传曾启发过许多人的爱国救国的志愿。但在今天看来，那只是在他维新的初期，对于落后保守的许多人来说，是起过进步作用的。他在“公车上书”之后，很快地接近了封建主和官僚阶级的最上层。他所希望的是在一个“圣君”之下做一个商鞅或王安石式的“贤相”，这证明他已完全站在封建统治阶级的立场上了。他所热爱的“国”是封建统治阶级的“国”，也就是地主士绅的“国”。这是保守改良主义思想，浓厚的正统观念；他的保皇改良已远远落后于同盟会的革命主张。辛亥革命以后，他又以保守改良主义维护地主士绅阶级的利益，所以能与大地主、军阀、官僚不止一次地周旋合作。他说怕流血，怕乱，就是怕革命、怕人民。在戊戍变法时期起过了进步作用之后，他的思想就落伍了。我受了他的爱国教育，但我的爱国思想的内容是小资产阶级个人主义的。他在我的思想中撒下发扬祖国文化传统的思想种子，我是永远感谢的。但是如果我没有站在民族立场、人民立场，没有批判能力，我所谓文化传统的内容就可能把封建糟粕也笼统地、原封不动地保存住，例如我的尊崇士绅，正统观念，贤人政治等思想就都属于这一类。
    我父亲晚年曾周游讲学，他的目的之一就是争取青年，以抗拒最进步的无产阶级革命思想。他培养青年的“求知欲”，也就是纯技术观点的学术研究。他也曾希望知识分子学习走改良主义的“社会主义”路线。这一切又都深深地影响了我。我自己的阶级意识，再加以那样的环境，更阻碍了我去接近进步的思想。对于威尔斯、拉斯基的崇拜，对于革命初期苏联的错误看法，便是一连串的后果。
    至于使我留在北京不走的原因，一方面是由于我对反动政府已不存丝毫幻想，另一方面幻想着“社会主义”。我从研究都市计划的理论开始，我以为自己是一个拥护社会主义的人。我不只赞成计划经济，并且希望它表现在区域、城乡、都市、住宅等计划上。我所接受过来的“社会主义”是改良主义者所高唱的“社会主义”，而我自以为是同马克思主义者所主张的社会主义可能是同一回事。正如威尔斯在同斯大林谈话中所表现的那种愚昧，以为资本主义国家里所称扬的所谓“盎格罗撒克逊人所意味的社会主义”同马克思列宁的社会主义是有“思想上联系”和“血缘关系”的。我自己认为在思想上同共产党是接近的，所以愿意留在这里等共产党来。清华大学解放以后，解放军干部等所表现的一系列“奇迹”使我兴奋。解放初期当人民政府找我参加各种会议时，我便心悦诚服地愿意“效劳”，自己思想中还包含着浓厚的“士为知己者用”的旧观念，还没有做“主人翁”，更说不上站在人民的立场为人民服务的思想。许多新的认识是经过近两年多以来的工作和学习才逐渐建立的。
    我这样的挖根是要今天的我分清敌我，站稳立场，爱我们人民中国，坚决地要求全心全意为人民服务。但我的分析还不够深入，这不过是现阶段学习中初步的认识而已。我的问题离挖根到底还远得很。我还要不断学习改造，希望大家多帮助我。
