    The First National Conference on Ethnic Education opened on September 20 and closed on the afternoon of September 28. Attending the conference were leading comrades from education administrative departments of the central government, major administrative regions, and relevant provinces and cities, as well as ethnic minority education workers and representatives from relevant departments, totaling 126 people. These included representatives from Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Miao, Yi, Mosuo, A-xi, Minjia, Korean, Gaoshan, and Man nationalities.

    During the preparation and proceedings of the conference, we gained a better understanding of the basic situation of ethnic minority education nationwide:

    Since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the People's Government, active assistance, and the efforts of people of all ethnic groups, ethnic minority education in regions such as Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia has seen considerable development, and other regions have also begun to make progress. Currently, there are: over 9,100 ethnic minority primary schools nationwide, over 4,860 primary schools that also enroll ethnic minority students, with a total of over 943,000 ethnic minority children attending; 117 ethnic minority secondary schools, over 490 secondary schools that also enroll ethnic minority students, with a total of over 45,600 ethnic minority students; 6 ethnic institutes, 1 university, and over 80 universities that also enroll ethnic minority students, with a total of over 4,150 ethnic minority students; 5 cadre schools, and 18 ethnic cadre training classes, with a total of over 4,400 students. In addition, various types of cadre training classes have been held in ethnic minority areas over the past two years. In Xinjiang Province alone, local cadre training classes trained over 3,600 cadres in 1950. When the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region was established last November, there were only nine ethnic minority cadres, but now there are over 1,000. In regions that were liberated earlier, the winter school movement has gradually unfolded. The achievements in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, and North China are particularly noteworthy. In Xinjiang Province during the 1950 winter school movement, there were over 6,670 winter schools throughout the province, with over 256,000 participants, exceeding the planned target by one and a half times. Adults, youth, and women of various ethnic groups enthusiastically participated in winter school learning.

    However, mainly due to the different historical conditions of each ethnic group, and also due to the different times of liberation, the development of education work in various regions and ethnic groups is very uneven. For example, in the Northeast region, the enrollment rate of Korean children has reached about 92% of school-age children, and primary education is approaching universal coverage; there are already 57 secondary schools, with 25,870 students; in the Yanbian Special Region, there is an average of one middle school for every two districts, and one middle school student for every 35 people. The number of primary schools in Inner Mongolia has increased to over 3,750, with over 307,000 students of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups, more than three times the highest figure during the Japanese puppet regime; the number of secondary schools has increased to ten, with 3,568 students of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups, also greatly exceeding the highest figure during the Japanese puppet regime. Xinjiang had 14 provincial secondary schools with over 4,600 students. After liberation, 38 seven-year middle schools were newly established, enrolling 6,614 students. In addition, ethnic minority education in provinces such as Qinghai and Ningxia has also seen significant development. However, at the same time, in some ethnic minority areas, such as the Hengduan Mountains in the Southwest and pastoral areas in the Northwest, there are still only a few schools or no schools at all. Apart from ethnic groups such as Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Korean, and Kazakh, many ethnic minorities have only simple written languages, or even none at all. Generally speaking, ethnic minority education is still relatively backward.

    The conference identified the following main problems existing in ethnic minority education work:

    1. The degree of importance attached to ethnic minority education by the People's Governments in various regions is inconsistent. Individual education administrative departments in Northwest China, Central and South China, and North China's Chahar and Pingyuan regions still show insufficient attention to this. Generally speaking, the education administrative departments of the major administrative regions in Northeast, Southwest, Northwest, and Central and South China have begun to establish institutions specifically responsible for ethnic minority education, but the cadres are not yet fully equipped. Education administrative departments below the provincial and municipal levels have mostly not established such institutions, making it difficult to strengthen leadership over ethnic minority education. In the work, Han cadres are more likely to adopt a generalized attitude to deal with ethnic minority education issues; ethnic minority cadres are very concerned about the development of their own ethnic culture and education, but some people have a tendency to be overly eager for quick success, regardless of the actual situation.

    2. In the past, the relevant regions carried out their work based on the general principles of the Common Program's cultural and educational policies and ethnic policies, and achieved certain results. However, apart from cadre education, there were no specific provisions regarding the specific guidelines and tasks of general education, so there was great inconsistency in the thinking and working methods of cadres. For example, regarding the content and form of ethnic minority education, and the issue of curriculum and teaching materials, it is necessary to take into account both ethnic characteristics and the unity of the entire national education. How to effectively unify these two aspects is unclear in the minds of many cadres, and some only one-sidedly emphasize one aspect.

    3. There is a particular shortage of teachers for ethnic minorities, and the textbook problem in many regions has not been well resolved. The issues of teachers and teaching materials are urgently required to be resolved in the education work of all ethnic minorities.

    4. Most ethnic minority areas are economically backward, and the people live in poverty. Local education funding is generally very difficult, and children's enrollment is greatly restricted by economic conditions. If special financial assistance is not obtained at the current stage, it will be difficult to develop education work.

    Based on the above situation and problems, the conference focused on discussing and determining the following issues:

    1. Clarified the general policy of ethnic minority education, that is, ethnic minority education must be of New Democratic content, and should adopt national forms suitable for the development and progress of the people of all ethnic groups. This clarifies that the educational content of all ethnic minorities must be New Democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass education, and cannot be education of any other nature. However, this kind of education must take national forms and take into account national characteristics in order to be well integrated with the actual conditions of each ethnic group, otherwise it will not have good results.

    2. Education administrative departments at all levels of the People's Government should fully value ethnic minority education work and strengthen leadership over ethnic minority education work. The conference stipulated that the current work policy of ethnic minority education should be based on the actual situation of education in each ethnic group, and adopt the policy of consolidation, development, rectification, and transformation. In the southwestern, northwestern, and other provincial mountainous areas, pastoral areas, and remote border areas where ethnic minority education work has no foundation, schools and various cultural and educational undertakings should be established with emphasis; in some ethnic minority areas in provinces such as Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hunan, where the foundation was better in the past but the work has not been fully restored, vigorous restoration and active rectification should be carried out; in ethnic minority areas such as Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, where the foundation was better in the past and considerable development has been made since liberation, emphasis should be placed on enriching quality and making appropriate development. It was also decided to establish ethnic minority education institutions or designate full-time personnel to be responsible for grasping ethnic minority education work in the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the relevant education administrative departments of the People's Government at all levels.

    3. The primary task of ethnic minority education at present should be to cultivate ethnic minority cadres to meet the needs of political, economic, cultural, and educational construction of all ethnic groups. At the same time, primary education and adult spare-time education should be strengthened to improve the cultural level of ethnic minorities, and efforts should be made to solve the problem of teachers in schools at all levels of ethnic minorities.

    4. In various ethnic minority areas, political and ideological education centered on patriotism, especially resistance to the US and aid to Korea, should be implemented step by step and systematically to oppose imperialist aggression, eliminate the remaining influence of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; overcome great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism. Promote the spirit of equality, unity, friendship, and cooperation among ethnic groups, and the fine traditions of all ethnic groups, strengthen the concept of the motherland and the enthusiasm for supporting the People's Government among the people of all ethnic groups. Strive together to defend the motherland and build the motherland.

    5. The teaching plans and syllabuses of ethnic minority schools should be based on the regulations of the Central Ministry of Education, and may be modified or supplemented appropriately in combination with the specific conditions of each ethnic group. The school system of ethnic minority schools at all levels should follow the "Decision on Reforming the School System" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and gradually implement reforms and establish schools in combination with the specific conditions of ethnic minority areas.

    6. Regarding the language issue in ethnic minority education, the conference stipulated that for ethnic groups with existing common languages, such as Mongolian, Korean, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Kazakh, all courses in primary and secondary schools must be taught in their own ethnic languages. For ethnic groups with independent languages but no written language or incomplete written language, while starting to create written language and reform written language, teaching should be carried out in Han language or the language commonly used by the ethnic group, according to the principle of voluntariness. Regarding the issue of ethnic minority students learning Chinese, the conference unanimously agreed that schools at all levels of ethnic minorities may set up Chinese language courses according to the needs and voluntariness of local ethnic minorities.

    7. Regarding the education funding in ethnic minority areas, in addition to allocating education funding according to the general expenditure standards, local People's Governments should also allocate special funds according to the economic conditions of each ethnic area and education work to help solve the special difficulties of ethnic minority schools in terms of equipment, teacher treatment, and student life.

    In addition, the conference extensively collected materials on the education situation of ethnic minorities in various regions, and exchanged views on issues such as the written language of ethnic minorities, cultural work, and the compilation of textbooks.

    Based on the above principles and spirit, the conference revised and adopted four draft documents, namely "Instructions on Strengthening Ethnic Minority Education Work," "Decision on Establishing Ethnic Minority Education Administrative Institutions," "Trial Program for Training Ethnic Minority Teachers," and "Provisional Measures for the Treatment of Ethnic Minority Students," and plans to request the approval of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council and to be promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education.

    In addition, regarding the education funding and staffing issues of ethnic minorities, the representatives of various regions and ethnic groups at the conference discussed and formulated a plan for the appropriate development of ethnic minority education work next year. The required funding, except for the funding for ethnic institutes, which will be resolved by the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Government Administration Council, and the two places in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, which may not be subsidized separately, the ethnic minority education funding in the remaining Northwest, Southwest, Central and South, North China, and East China regions needs a part of the central subsidy, and the amount has been drafted and reported to the Council for verification. In addition, the relevant education administrative departments of the People's Government at all levels should establish ethnic minority education institutions or designate full-time personnel to be responsible for grasping the work of ethnic minority education. However, according to the reflection of representatives from various places, the education administrative departments of the local People's Government at all levels already feel insufficient manpower under the current working conditions. Therefore, it is recommended that the Government Administration Council, when determining the staffing of the People's Government at all levels, can give appropriate consideration according to the complexity of ethnic minority education work in each region.

    Are the above points appropriate? Please advise.

    中央人民政府教育部关于第一次全国民族教育会议的报告
    （一九五一年十一月二十三日马叙伦部长在政务院第一百一十二次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    第一次全国民族教育会议在九月二十日开幕，至九月二十八日下午闭幕。出席这次会议的有中央、各大行政区、各有关省市人民政府教育行政部门的负责同志，有少数民族教育工作者和各有关部门的代表共一百二十六人，其中包括汉、蒙、藏、回、维吾尔、哈萨克、苗、彝、摩些、阿西、民家、朝鲜、高山、满等民族的代表。
    在会议的准备和进行过程中，首先较多地了解了全国少数民族教育的基本情况：
    各地区解放以来，由于人民政府的正确领导，积极帮助和各民族人民的努力，东北、内蒙、新疆、青海、宁夏等地区的少数民族教育已有不少的发展，其他地区也开始有进步。目前全国共有：少数民族小学九千一百余所，兼收少数民族学生的小学四千八百六十余所，各少数民族入学儿童共九十四万三千余人；少数民族中等学校一百一十七所，兼收少数民族学生的中等学校四百九十余所，各少数民族学生共计四万五千六百余人；民族学院六所，高等学校一所，兼收少数民族学生的高等学校八十余所，各少数民族学生共四千一百五十余人；干部学校五所，另有民族干部训练班十八个班，在学学生人数共四千四百余人。此外两年来各少数民族地区都举办了各种性质的干部训练班，只新疆省的地方干部训练班在一九五○年内就训练了三千六百余名干部，西康藏族自治区在去年十一月成立时只有九个少数民族干部，现在已有一千多人了。在解放较久的地区，冬学运动已逐步展开。其中以新疆、青海、内蒙、东北、华北等地区的成绩较好。新疆省在一九五○年的冬学运动中，全省共有冬学六千六百七十余处，参加学习的共二十五万六千余人，超过预定计划的一倍半。各少数民族的成人、青年、妇女都很踊跃地参加冬学学习。
    但是主要的由于各民族历史条件的不同，同时由于解放的先后不同，各地区各民族教育工作的发展很不平衡。如：东北区的朝鲜族入学儿童已达学龄儿童百分之九十二左右，小学教育已接近普及的程度；中等学校已有五十七所，学生二五、八七○名；在延边专区，平均每两个区就有一所中学，每三十五个人当中就有一名中学生。内蒙小学已增至三千七百五十余所，蒙汉等民族学生达三十万七千余人，比日伪统治时期的最高数字增加到三倍以上；中等学校已增至十所，蒙汉等民族学生三千五百六十八人，也大大超过日伪统治时期的最高数字。新疆原有省立中等学校十四所，学生四千六百余人，解放后新创办了七年制中学三十八所，招收学生六、六一四名。此外，青海、宁夏等省少数民族教育，都有显著的发展。但同时在西南的横断山脉一带、西北的游牧区等少数民族地区，至今还只有少数的学校或者还没有学校，除蒙古、藏族、维吾尔、朝鲜、哈萨克等民族外，许多少数民族只有简单的文字，甚或还没有自己的文字。一般地说，少数民族教育还是比较落后的。
    会议了解了少数民族教育工作中存在着下列主要的问题：
    一、各地区人民政府对于少数民族教育重视的程度不一致。西北、中南、华北的察哈尔、平原等地区的个别教育行政部门，尚有对此重视不够的现象存在。一般说，东北、西南、西北、中南的大行政区的区教育行政部门已开始建立专管少数民族教育的机构，但干部还没配备齐全。各有关省、市以下的教育行政部门多未建立此种机构，也就难以加强对于少数民族教育的领导。在工作当中，汉族干部较易采取一般化的态度以处理少数民族教育问题；少数民族干部对于发展本民族文化教育是非常关切的。但有些人则有不顾实际情况求成过急的偏向。
    二、过去，各有关地区根据了共同纲领的文化教育政策和民族政策的一般原则进行工作，也取得了一定的成绩。但除干部教育外关于一般教育的具体方针和任务等还没有具体的规定，所以在干部的思想上和工作作法上很不一致。例如：少数民族教育的内容与形式问题，课程教材问题，既要照顾民族特点，又不能忽视整个国家教育的统一性。这两方面怎样很好地统一起来，在许多干部的思想上是模糊不清的，有的只片面地强调一个方面。
    三、少数民族的师资特别缺乏，许多地区的教科书问题也还没有很好地解决。师资和教材问题是各少数民族教育工作中所迫切要求解决的。
    四、少数民族地区大部经济落后，人民生活贫苦，地方教育经费一般都很困难，儿童入学受到经济生活极大的限制。在目前阶段如果得不到经费上的特别帮助，教育工作很难得到开展。
    根据以上的情况和问题，此次会议着重讨论并确定了以下的问题：
    一、明确了少数民族教育的总方针，即少数民族教育必须是新民主主义的内容，并应采取适合于各民族人民发展和进步的民族形式。这就明确了各少数民族的教育内容必须是新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的教育，而不能是其他性质的教育。但这种教育必须采取民族形式，照顾民族特点，才能很好地和各民族实际情况结合起来，否则便不会有良好的效果。
    二、各级人民政府教育行政部门应充分重视少数民族教育工作，加强对少数民族教育工作的领导。会议规定了现阶段少数民族教育的工作方针，应根据各民族教育的实际情况分别采取巩固、发展、整顿、改造的方针。在西南、西北及其他各省的山岳区、游牧区和偏僻的边境等少数民族教育工作尚无基础的地区，应有重点地创办学校和各种文教事业；云南、广西、湖南等省某些过去虽较有基础但工作尚未完全恢复的少数民族地区，则应大力恢复并积极整顿；东北、内蒙、新疆等过去基础较好、解放后又有相当发展的少数民族地区，则应着重充实质量并作适当的发展。并决定在中央人民政府教育部和有关的各级人民政府教育行政部门，建立少数民族教育机构或指定专职人员负责，掌握少数民族教育工作。
    三、少数民族教育目前应以培养少数民族干部为首要任务，以满足各民族政治、经济、文化教育建设的需要，同时应当加强小学教育及成人业余教育，以提高少数民族的文化水平，并应努力解决少数民族各级学校的师资问题。
    四、在各少数民族地区，应有步骤、有系统地实施以爱国主义特别是抗美援朝为中心的政治思想教育，反对帝国主义侵略，肃清帝国主义和国民党反动派的残余影响；克服大民族主义，与狭隘民族主义思想。发扬民族间的平等、团结、友爱、合作精神和各民族的优良传统，加强各民族人民的祖国观念和拥护人民政府的热情。共同为保卫祖国、建设祖国而奋斗。
    五、各少数民族学校的教学计划，教学大纲应以中央教育部的规定为基础，并得结合各民族的具体情况，酌量加以变通或补充。少数民族各级学校的学制，应遵照中央人民政府政务院“关于改革学制的决定”，结合各少数民族地区的具体情况，有步骤地实行改革和建立。
    六、关于少数民族教育中的语文问题，会议规定凡有现行通用文字的民族如蒙古、朝鲜、藏族、维吾尔、哈萨克等，小学和中学的各科课程必须用本民族语文教学。有独立语言而尚无文字或文字不完全的民族，一面着手创立文字和改革文字；一面得按自愿原则，采用汉族语文或本民族所习用的语文进行教学。关于少数民族学生学汉文课的问题，会议一致同意各少数民族的各级学校得按当地少数民族的需要和自愿设汉文课。
    七、关于少数民族地区的教育经费，各地人民政府除按一般开支标准，拨给教育经费外，并应按各民族地区的经济情况及教育工作，另拨专款，帮助解决少数民族学校的设备、教师待遇、学生生活等方面的特殊困难。
    此外，此次会议并广泛地搜集了各地区少数民族教育情况的材料，并就少数民族的文字问题、文化工作问题、教科书编译等问题交换了意见。
    根据上述原则和精神，会议修正通过了四个文件草案，即“关于加强少数民族教育工作的指示”、“关于建立少数民族教育行政机构的决定”、“培养少数民族师资试行方案”和“少数民族学生待遇暂行办法”等四个文件，拟请政务院文化教育委员会批准，由教育部公布实行。
    此外，关于少数民族的教育经费和教育工作人员的编制问题。会议中各地区各民族代表曾讨论并拟定了明年各民族教育工作适当发展的计划，其所需经费除民族学院经费由政务院民族事务委员会解决，东北、内蒙两地可不另补助外，其余西北、西南、中南、华北、华东等区的少数民族教育经费需要中央补助一部分，已拟具数目报院请予核定。此外有关的各级人民政府教育行政部门均应建立少数民族教育机构，或指定专职人员负责掌管少数民族教育的工作。但据各地代表反映，各级地方人民政府教育行政部门，在现在的工作情况下，已感人力不足，因此建议政务院在确定各级人民政府编制时，能按各地区少数民族教育工作的繁简，予以适当的照顾。
    以上各点，是否妥当，请指示。
