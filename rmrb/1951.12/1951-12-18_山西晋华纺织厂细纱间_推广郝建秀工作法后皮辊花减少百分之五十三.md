    Fine Spinning Workshop of Shanxi Jinhua Textile Factory:
    After Promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method,
    Roller Lapping Reduced by 53 Percent
    Comrade Editor: Significant achievements have been made in Jinhua Textile Factory, Yuci County, Shanxi, since the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was promoted two months ago. Among the 405 workers in the fine spinning workshop, 291 have basically mastered the characteristics of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, which has significantly reduced the amount of roller lapping in the entire workshop. Before the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the average daily roller lapping output per machine was 12.66 taels. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the average daily roller lapping output per machine was 5.93 taels, a reduction of 53 percent. The workers are highly motivated to learn this work method. They have realized in their practical work that learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method not only reduces roller lapping and improves quality, but also allows them to master the machine's laws, thereby reducing labor intensity. Worker Chai Laizhi said, "In the past, when I got on the machine, I was always tense and relaxed intermittently, and I was jumping around in the car file when I was busy, and the head was still constantly breaking; since I learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, I have a number in my mind and I am not tired at all." Worker Xiong Xiangrong said, "I used to watch 300 spindles and produce 15 taels of roller lapping in eight hours; after learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, I can watch 400 spindles, but the roller lapping is only 8 taels."

    山西晋华纺织厂细纱间
    推广郝建秀工作法后
    皮辊花减少百分之五十三
    编辑同志：山西榆次县晋华纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法两个月以来，已有显著成绩。细纱间四百零五名工人中，已有二百九十一人基本上掌握了郝建秀工作法的特点，使全车间皮辊花的出数，显著地下降。没有推广郝建秀工作法前，每日每台车平均出皮辊花十二点六六两，推广郝建秀工作法以后，每日每台车平均出皮辊花五点九三两，减少了百分之五十三。工人们学习这一工作法的情绪是很高的。他们在实际工作中体会到：学了郝建秀工作法，不但能减少皮辊花、提高质量，同时，还可以掌握机器的规律，从而减轻劳动强度。工人柴来枝说：“过去一上车，老是紧一阵、松一阵，忙的时候在车档里乱跳，头儿仍是一个劲地断；自从学了郝建秀工作法以后，心中有数，一点也不累了。”工人熊香绒说：“我过去看三百锭，八小时就出皮辊花十五两；学了郝建秀工作法，我可以看四百锭，皮辊花却只出八两。”　阮承业
