    [By Our Newspaper] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League convened a conference of activist Youth League members from its directly affiliated organizations on the 19th. Over 1,000 people attended. Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, delivered a mobilization report on "Actively Launching the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign" at the conference.
    Feng Wenbin emphasized the relationship between this campaign and the Youth League and young people. He said: Many Youth League members and young people come from the old society and old families, and therefore, have more or less been tainted with bad habits of the old society, and some have even been tainted with corrupt habits. On the other hand, because young people are relatively simple and frank and have less revolutionary experience, they are also easily influenced and tainted with bad habits. Therefore, every League member and young person should receive a profound education in this campaign. They must be educated to establish a sense of ownership and cultivate the excellent quality of cherishing the property of the people.
    Next, he analyzed the root causes of these corruption and waste phenomena in the Youth League. He said: This is mainly because League members and young people have individualism and selfish ideas, and they do not care about the interests of the country and the people. At the same time, bureaucracy in leadership has fueled this phenomenon of corruption and waste.
    Regarding what the Youth League should do in the increase production and practice economy, anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, he pointed out: First, mobilize Youth League members and young people to actively participate in the study sessions in their organizations, and check whether League members have engaged in corruption or waste, clean up and purify the League organization, and recruit young people who have performed actively in the campaign into the League. Second, the League organization should call on League members and young people who have committed acts of corruption to confess voluntarily. Those who confess voluntarily will have their punishment reduced if the offense is serious, or be exempted from punishment if the offense is minor; but those who are exposed and still do not confess should be severely punished. Third, the Youth League organization should also mobilize League members and young people to report and expose the corrupt acts of corrupt elements. Fourth, actively put forward rationalization proposals to the administrative leadership to eliminate corruption and waste and improve work efficiency.
    Feng Wenbin also pointed out: Each League branch in the organizations should carry out this campaign in a planned and step-by-step manner under the leadership and support of the Party and administrative leadership of their respective units. Within the Youth League organization, a rectification-style approach should be used to check for corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles; during the campaign, if the person in charge of the organization suppresses criticism, the Youth League organization or League members have the right to appeal to higher authorities. They must not show submission or cowardice, but bravely fight all corruption and waste to the end. Finally, he pointed out: Youth League branches should regard the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign as the central task at present, and the League's leading organs at all levels should promote this campaign with the utmost attention.

    青年团中央直属机关召开积极分子大会
    冯文彬作开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动的动员报告
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在十九日召开了直属机关中的青年团员积极分子大会。到会一千多人。青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬在会上作了“积极展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动”的动员报告。
    冯文彬着重指出了这次运动和青年团、青年的关系。他说：许多青年团员和青年都是来自旧社会、旧家庭，因而或多或少沾染了一些旧社会的坏习惯，有的甚至沾染了贪污的习气。另一方面由于青年比较单纯、坦白，受革命锻炼少，也容易接受坏影响，沾染坏习惯。因此，要在这个运动中使每个团员和青年受到深刻的教育。要教育他们树立起主人翁的思想，养成热爱人民财产的优秀品质。
    接着，他分析了青年团中产生这些贪污、浪费现象的根源。他说：这主要是团员和青年存在着个人主义和自私自利思想，不关心国家和人民利益，同时领导上的官僚主义又助长了这种贪污、浪费的现象。
    关于青年团在增产节约，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中做些什么的问题，他指出：首先是发动青年团员和青年积极参加机关的学习，并检查团员有无贪污、浪费现象，清理和纯洁团的组织，吸收在运动中表现积极的青年入团。其次，团组织要号召有贪污事实的团员和青年自动坦白，凡是自动坦白的，重者减罪，轻者免罪；但经检举而仍不坦白者，则应受到严惩。第三，青年团组织还要发动团员和青年检举、揭发贪污分子的贪污行为。第四，积极地向行政领导提出肃清贪污、浪费现象和提高工作效率的合理化建议。
    冯文彬并指出：各机关团支部都要在本单位党、行政的领导和支持下有计划、有步骤地开展这个运动。在青年团组织内要以整风的方式来检查贪污、浪费现象和官僚主义作风；在运动中，机关负责人如有压制批评的现象，青年团组织或团员有权利越级上诉。决不能表示屈服和懦弱，要勇敢地与一切贪污、浪费现象斗争到底。最后，他指出：青年团支部都应把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动作为当前的中心工作，团的各级领导机关应以最大的注意来推动这一运动。
