    East China State-Owned Heavy Industry Factories Should Further Explore Production Potential
    Yue Jing
    Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the heavy industry factories under the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department have shaken off their dependence on imperialism, relied on the working class, and self-reliantly restored and developed production, achieving remarkable results. The current output of each factory has exceeded eight times that of December 1949, and the variety of products has also increased. High-grade cast iron, large motors, precision machine tools, fine yarn textile machinery, electrical equipment, etc., which previously relied on foreign countries, can mostly be manufactured by ourselves; the quality of some products (such as universal tool grinders) has reached international levels. In order to cooperate with China's water conservancy construction, this spring, 123 hardware factories (including private factories) and more than 12,000 workers and technicians in Shanghai participated in the crash production of parts for the Huai River project and completed the task as scheduled before the arrival of the flood season. It is estimated that the annual production volume of the factories directly under the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department will increase by 90 percent compared with last year. These great achievements in production of the heavy industry factories under the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department fully demonstrate the superiority of the New Democratic system.
    However, there are still many shortcomings in the production of various factories. The most significant of these is that some factories still have a serious phenomenon of delayed orders, especially in the electromechanical industry. For example, the Shanghai Motor Factory and General Machinery Factory have order delays of more than 50 percent. A batch of rubber-sheathed cable orders from the Shanghai Wire Factory were delayed by 103 days. Because of the delayed orders, not only will the enterprise be fined, but it will also affect the smooth progress of production and engineering construction in other factories, causing incalculable losses to the country.
    The production potential of the heavy industry factories under the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department has not yet been fully exploited. The utilization rate of existing equipment in each factory is generally 50 percent. According to the statistics of the Machinery Division of the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department, the current utilization rate of the existing equipment of the factories under the Machinery Division is only 25 percent, calculated on the basis of 24-hour operation. To date, many factories still have a considerable number of machines idle. For example, a workshop of the Asia Iron and Steel Plant has 30 lathes, but only 26 are currently in operation due to a shortage of lathe operators; the Daxin Machinery Factory also has several lathes idle due to insufficient lathe operators; the absenteeism rate of the Qiujiang Machinery Factory reaches 15 to 20 percent, and due to insufficient technicians, there are more people in the day shift and fewer in the night shift, so there are machines in the night shift that no one operates. In addition, there are the following situations in various factories: (1) Due to unbalanced equipment or incompatible production capacities of various machines, some machines are idle. For example, in the first half of this year, one-third of the special tools in the Nanjing Radio Factory were often left unused; the Qiujiang Machinery Factory has a 15-ton broaching machine, but it has to be left idle due to the lack of broaches. There are also gantry planers and automatic lathes that are idle because there are no suitable factory buildings to install them; the Daxin Machinery Factory has a steelmaking furnace that is not in operation; the Asia Iron and Steel Plant has steel rope machines, wood screw machines, and scissor cars, all of which are idle. (2) Poor coordination between departments and poor adjustment of operations within a workshop or a work section affect the improvement of equipment utilization. At present, each factory has more or less the phenomenon of drawings, materials, blanks, and tools being disconnected from machine production (referred to by workshop workers as "the four major empties"), and machines cannot operate regularly because they are waiting for drawings, materials, blanks, and tools; especially serious is the disconnection of drawings from production, or the design of drawings is not thorough, resulting in rework while doing, often causing unnecessary rework, causing completely avoidable losses to the wealth of the country. (3) Unscientific labor organization, operational technical problems, or failure to maintain machines well, reducing the number of repairs and shortening the repair time, failure to repair broken machines in a timely manner, failure to install new machines in a timely manner, affect equipment utilization and cause serious waste. For example, the Asia Iron and Steel Plant, due to the lack of dedicated personnel in charge and problems with labor organization and operation methods, has successively had six furnaces of silicomanganese steel scrapped and two furnaces of alloy steel of poor quality, causing significant losses to the wealth of the country. As for the phenomenon of insufficient daily maintenance of machines, a lot of dust in the factory buildings makes machines prone to rust, and workers randomly place metal tools on machines causing damage to the machines, which exists in many factories.
    People are the most valuable capital in an enterprise. People can turn waste into useful things and turn machines to produce endless wealth. Therefore, manpower should be highly valued. However, the heavy industry factories under the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department, on the one hand, lack technical workers, and on the other hand, seriously waste manpower. This situation exists simultaneously even in the same factory. For example, the Qiujiang Machinery Factory, on the one hand, cannot fully operate its machines due to insufficient technicians, more people in the day shift, and fewer in the night shift; on the other hand, there is an unreasonable phenomenon that the labor force is not organized reasonably, and the workers in each workshop are unevenly distributed in work and leisure, some are busy and some are idle; the Daxin Machinery Factory does not have enough technical personnel, but has three intern engineers who are in charge of recording work and handling administrative affairs; the factory's administrative personnel are not familiar with the business, and when the factory accepts orders or someone comes to the factory to visit, they have to find the chief engineer Sun Yunluan—who successfully trial-produced nodular cast iron—making it impossible for him to concentrate on production. (For a considerable period of time, personnel from other places who visited the factories often overwhelmed the factories, affecting production. This phenomenon must be studied and improved). In addition, many meetings of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League take up production time (labor model and advanced worker meetings are the most frequent), some of which can be cancelled, and some of which should be moved outside of production time. Finally, some factories do not pay enough attention to labor protection and safety and hygiene, which affects workers' health and attendance rate; the administrative leading cadres of some factories do not pay enough attention to the workers' rational suggestions, and there are shortcomings in the combination of technology and labor (such as drawing designers not being able to go to the site and study with the workers, listening to the workers' opinions with an open mind, resulting in rework while doing or redoing, etc.).
    In addition to the low utilization rate of equipment and the unreasonable use of manpower, there are also many wasteful phenomena in the factories in terms of heavy industry capital turnover, consumption of raw materials, electricity, and fuel, and too many accidents.
    At present, some heavy industry factories under the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department have begun to promote the advanced Soviet production experience—high-speed cutting method. Machine tools that use this advanced working method not only significantly increase production, but also greatly improve product quality. The machine tools with the lowest work efficiency have increased by three times compared with before using the high-speed cutting method, and the higher work efficiency has increased by eight or nine times compared with before. The above facts all prove that the production potential of the East China State-Owned Heavy Industry Factories is very great. The problem is only that it has not been well explored in the past.
    On the one hand, the production potential has not been fully exploited, and on the other hand, the phenomenon of delayed orders is widespread. This is the most significant contradiction in the production of the heavy industry factories under the East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department. The main reason why the factories have not well resolved this contradiction since liberation is that the leading cadres of the factories have not yet clearly understood the fundamentally different nature between state-owned enterprises and bureaucratic capitalist enterprises during the past reactionary rule, and the need for two fundamentally different methods and attitudes in business management due to the different nature of the enterprises. They have not yet established the idea of relying on the working class to do a good job in production. Therefore, they cannot rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to improve enterprise management and explore production potential in all aspects, and wage a planned struggle against various wasteful phenomena. When the Shanghai factories began to promote the high-speed cutting method, it was not carried out under leadership, but mostly out of the conscious actions of the masses. After the initial promotion of the high-speed cutting method, many new problems have emerged in the factories, such as the disconnection between various departments becoming more serious, the planning work and technical management work not keeping up with technological development, and the reward system and wage system not being reasonable enough. The process of promoting each advanced working method is also a process of struggle between old and new ideas. The factory's administrative leading cadres must give strong support to advanced workers. However, when some lathe operators in Shanghai factories began to try the high-speed cutting method, the factory's administrative leading cadres not only did not give strong support, but also did not deal with it in a timely manner when some backward elements in the factory satirized and attacked advanced workers. Prior to this, the workers of the heavy industry factories had also put forward many rationalization proposals and played a significant role, but the administrative leading cadres of some factories did not pay enough attention to this. All of these seriously affect the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of the workers.
    The experience of advanced factories and mines in Northeast China proves that "the key to increasing production and practicing economy is to rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to tap the potential of enterprises, improve industrial production and improve enterprise management; rather than simply relying on handling some stagnant materials and merely selling some overstocked finished products to complete financial tasks (which of course should be done); let alone solving problems by 'finding warehouses and digging warehouses' as proposed by some factories." (See the Circular of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on Strengthening the Leadership of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement) The purpose of increasing production and practicing economy is not only to complete today's tasks, but more importantly, to lay a better foundation for future industrial production. This requires the leading cadres of all factories and mines to go deep into the movement and lead the movement by standing in front of the movement. The East China Military and Political Committee's Industry Department began on November 28 to carry out ideological mobilization for the increase production and practice economy movement from top to bottom, and will then enter the action phase. From December to January of next year, the factories will take the tasks of checking the implementation of the 1951 production plan, compiling the 1952 annual production financial plan and increase production and practice economy plan, inventorying assets, and verifying funds as the central task. When carrying out this work, the administrative leading cadres of each factory must clearly establish the idea of relying on the working class to do a good job in production, explain the past achievements and the wasteful phenomena that still exist to all personnel in the factory, explain the political and economic significance of increasing production and practicing economy, further enhance the patriotism and revolutionary heroism of the staff and workers, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and explore production potential in all aspects. At the same time, we should pay more attention to workers' rationalization proposals, improve enterprise management, vigorously promote advanced Soviet production experience, improve labor organization and operation methods, rationally use manpower and improve the utilization rate of existing machinery and equipment, first of all, strengthen the planning work in the enterprise, and seize this main link to promote and guide production, so that the increase production and practice economy movement becomes a broad, mass, and sustained movement.

    华东国营重工业工厂应进一步发掘生产潜在能力
    乐　静
    解放以来，华东军政委员会工业部所属各重工业工厂，在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，摆脱了对帝国主义的依赖，依靠工人阶级，自力更生地恢复和发展生产，获得了显著的成就。现各厂产量超过一九四九年十二月的八倍，产品种类也较前增加。过去仰给于外国的高级铸铁、大型电机、精密工具机工具、细纱纺织机械、电工器材等，大多已能自己制造；某些产品的品质（如万能工具磨床等）并达到了国际水平。为了配合新中国的水利建设，今年春天，上海有一百二十三家五金工厂（包括私营工厂）、一万二千余名工人和技术人员，参加了赶制淮河工程所用机件的突击生产，并在大汛到来以前，如期完成了任务。华东军政委员会工业部直属各厂今年全年生产量，估计可较去年增加百分之九十。华东军政委员会工业部所属各重工业工厂在生产中的这些伟大成就，充分显示了新民主主义制度的优越性。
    但是，各厂在生产中还有不少缺点。其中表现得最显著的，是有些厂还严重地存在着定货脱期的现象，其中尤以机电业为最严重。如上海电机厂、通用机器厂，定货脱期均在百分之五十以上。上海电线厂一批橡套电缆的定货，交货脱期达一百零三天。因为定货脱期，不仅本企业要被处罚金，并且影响到其他工厂的生产和工程建设不能顺利进行，使国家遭致无法统计的损失。
    华东军政委员会工业部所属各重工业工厂的生产潜在能力，目前并未充分发挥，各厂现有设备利用率，一般为百分之五十。据华东军政委员会工业部机械处统计，机械处所属各厂的现有设备，以二十四小时不停地运转来计算，目前的利用率仅为百分之二十五。不少厂迄目前为止，尚有不少机器空放着。如亚细亚钢铁厂某工场有三十部车床，因为缺少车工，目前只开动二十六部；大鑫机器厂也因车工不够而停放着若干部车床；虬江机器厂缺勤率达到百分之十五至百分之二十，又因技工不够，目前日班人多，夜班人少，夜班就有机器没有人去开动。此外，各厂还存在着如下各种情况：（一）因为设备不平衡，或各种机器的生产能力不相适应，而使部分机器停放着没有开动。如南京有线电厂，今年上半年经常有三分之一的特种工具搁置未用；虬江机器厂有一部十五吨的拉床，因为缺少拉刀，只得空放着。另有龙门刨和自动车床，因为没有适当厂房安装而停放着；大鑫机器厂有一只炼钢炉没有开动；亚细亚钢铁厂有钢索机、木螺丝机、剪刀车，都停放着。（二）因各部门之间配合得不好，一个工场或一个车间内部的作业调整得不好，影响了设备利用率的提高。目前各厂都或多或少地存在着图样、材料、毛坯、工具与机器生产脱节（车间工人称之为“四大皆空”）的现象，机器为了等图样、材料、毛坯、工具而不能经常运转；其中特别严重的是因为图样与生产脱节，或图样设计不周，以致边做边改，常常造成不应有的返工现象，使国家财富蒙受完全可以避免的损失。（三）因为劳动组织不科学，操作技术有问题，或不能很好保养机器，减少检修次数和缩短检修时间，不能及时修理坏机器，不能及时安装新机器，而影响设备利用，造成严重浪费。如亚细亚钢铁厂，因缺乏专人负责，劳动组织和操作法又有问题，曾连续发生矽锰钢六炉作废、合金钢二炉品质低劣的事件，使国家财富蒙受重大损失。至于平日对机器保养不够，厂房内灰尘很多致机器容易生锈，工人在机器上随便安放金属工具使机器受损的现象，在很多厂都存在着。
    人是企业中最宝贵的资本，人可以把废料变成有用的东西，转动机器生产出无穷无尽的财富，因此，人力是应该十分珍视的。但是华东军政委员会工业部所属各重工业工厂，一方面技术工人缺乏，一方面却严重地浪费着人力。这种情况即在同一工厂中也同时存在。如虬江机器厂，一方面因技工不够，日班人多，夜班人少，使机器不能全部开动；一方面存在着因为劳动力组织得不够合理，各车间工人劳逸不均，忙的忙，闲的闲的不合理现象；大鑫机器厂的技术人员不够，但却有三个实习工程师，担任着记工账的工作，并兼办行政事务；工厂行政人员不谙业务，工厂接受定货或有人来厂参观，都要找总工程师孙云鸾——他试造球墨铸铁获得成功——使他不能专心生产。（相当长时期内，外地到各厂参观的人员，常常使工厂应接不暇，影响生产，这一现象必须研究改进）。此外，党、行政、工会、青年团很多会议，占去了生产时间（劳动模范和先进工作者会议最多），其中有些会议可以不开，有些会议应该移到生产时间以外去开。最后是部分工厂对劳动保护和安全卫生还注意不够，影响工人健康和出勤率；部分厂的行政领导干部对工人群众的合理建议尚不够重视，在技术与劳动的结合上也存有缺点（如图样设计人员不能到现场和工人群众研究，虚心听取工人意见，以致边做边改或返工重做等）。
    除了设备利用率不高、人力使用不够合理以外，各厂在重工业资金周转，原材料、电力、燃料的消耗，和事故太多等方面，也存有许多浪费现象。
    目前，华东军政委员会工业部所属部分重工业工厂，已开始推广苏联先进生产经验——高速切削法。凡使用了这一先进工作方法的机床，不但产量显著提高，产品品质也大有改进。工作效率最低的机床，也较使用高速切削法以前提高了三倍，工作效率较高，则较前提高了八、九倍。以上事实，都证明华东国营重工业工厂的生产潜在能力是十分巨大的，问题只在于过去没有很好地去发掘。
    一方面生产潜在能力没有充分发挥，另一方面普遍发生定货脱期现象，这是华东军政委员会工业部所属各重工业工厂在生产中所存在的最显著的矛盾。各厂解放以来，所以没有很好地解决这一矛盾，主要原因是各厂的领导干部对国家企业和过去反动统治时期的官僚资本企业两者之间截然不同的性质，和因企业性质不同而在经营管理上需要两种截然不同的方法和态度，还认识不清。他们还没有树立明确地依靠工人阶级搞好生产的思想。因此，就不能很好地去依靠群众、发动群众，改进企业管理，从各个方面去挖掘生产潜在能力，向各种浪费现象作有计划的斗争。上海各厂开始推广高速切削法时，就不是有领导地进行的，大多是出于群众的自觉行动。高速切削法初步推广以后，各厂都出现了许多新的问题，如各个部门之间的脱节现象更形严重，计划工作和技术管理工作跟不上技术发展，奖励制度与工资制度不够合理等等。每一种先进工作方法的推广过程，也就是新旧思想的斗争过程，工厂的行政领导干部，对先进工作者必须给以大力支持。但上海某些工厂车工在开始试行高速切削法时，厂的行政领导干部不但不给予有力支持，并且当工厂中的某些落后分子讽刺、打击先进工人时，也不予及时处理。在这以前，重工业各厂工人群众也曾经提出过许多合理化建议，并起了不少作用，但部分工厂的行政领导干部对此却不予重视。所有这些，都严重地影响着工人群众生产积极性、创造性的高度发挥。
    东北先进厂矿的经验证明：“增产节约的关键是依靠群众、发动群众来发挥企业潜力，提高工业生产与改善企业管理；而不是单纯依靠处理某些呆滞材料与仅仅推销某些积压成品而完成财政任务（这当然是应该做的）；更不是像某些工厂所提出的‘找仓库、挖仓库’来解决问题。”（见中共中央东北局关于加强增产节约运动领导的通报）增产节约的目的不仅是完成今天的任务，更重要的是为今后工业生产打下更好的基础。这就要求所有厂矿企业的领导干部，深入运动，站在运动之前去领导运动。华东军政委员会工业部已在十一月二十八日开始，从上到下进行开展增产节约运动的思想动员，接着即将进入行动阶段。从十二月份开始到明年一月的两个月中，各厂将把检查一九五一年生产计划执行情况，编制一九五二年度生产财务计划与增产节约计划，清点资产、核定资金等工作作为中心任务。在进行这一工作时，各厂行政领导干部必须明确树立依靠工人阶级搞好生产的思想，向厂内全体人员说明过去的成就和迄今仍然存在的浪费现象，说明增产节约的政治意义和经济意义，进一步提高职工群众的爱国主义与革命英雄主义精神，依靠群众、发动群众，从各个方面去挖掘生产潜在能力。与此同时，应更加重视工人的合理化建议，改进企业管理，大力推广苏联先进生产经验，改善劳动组织和操作方法，合理使用人力和提高现有机器设备利用率，首先是加强企业中的计划工作，抓住这一主要环节来推动与指导生产，使增产节约运动成为广泛的群众性的持久运动。
