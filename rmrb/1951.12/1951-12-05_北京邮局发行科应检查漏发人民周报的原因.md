    The Beijing Post Office Distribution Section Should Investigate the Reasons for Missing Issues of People's Weekly

    To the Editor: The Propaganda Department of the Linqu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province, in order to strengthen the study of cadres in service and facilitate the guidance of work, allocated a portion of funds from the cadre study expenses to subscribe to sixteen copies of "People's Weekly" from the local post office from March to September, and seventeen copies in October, which were distributed to various county and district units. Readers found the publication very helpful after receiving it. However, the post office's distribution procedures are very chaotic, with many errors, leading to numerous complaints from readers. For example, issues 33 and 34 have not been received yet, while issue 35 has already been delivered, and issue 36 has also not been received. For issue 37, only three copies were delivered instead of the expected seventeen, resulting in a total shortage of forty-two copies of "People's Weekly." In order to prevent the continuation of chaotic distribution procedures and to replenish the previous missing issues, the Propaganda Department of the Linqu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party suggested to the local post office on September 21st to send an official letter to the Beijing Post Office Distribution Section. Several letters have been sent back and forth, but no response has been received to date. Therefore, it is suggested that the Beijing Post Office promptly address the issue of missing "People's Weekly" issues, strengthen the education of distributors, establish a strong sense of work responsibility, and establish strict and scientific distribution procedures to reduce confusion in the work, in order to benefit the overall work.

    北京邮局发行科应检查漏发人民周报的原因
    编辑同志：中共山东临朐县委宣传部，为了加强在职干部的学习，有利于指导工作，因此从干部学习经费内抽出一部分钱，从三月到九月之间在当地邮局订“人民周报”十六份，十月份订了十七份，分发县区各单位。读者接到刊物后都觉得很好。但邮局的发行手续很乱，差错也很多，致使读者意见纷纷。如：三十三期和三十四期到现在还未发来，而三十五期已先发到，三十六期也未发到，三十七期应发十七份，只发来三份，这样共缺人民周报四十二份。为了防止发行手续混乱现象继续发生，以及补足以前未发的缺数，中共临朐县委宣传部曾建议当地邮局于九月二十一日向北京邮局发行科去公函一件。并前后去信数封，但至今未见答复。因此建议北京邮局对“人民周报”漏发事件应迅速处理，加强发行员的教育，树立很好的工作责任心，建立严格的科学的发行手续制度，减少工作中的错乱，以利于整个工作。
