In Shitang Village, Third District, Yongchun County, Guangxi Province, a serious incident occurred involving village cadres infringing on human rights, illegally arresting, and hanging women.

From May 30th to June 6th of this year, Qu Jizhao, the director of the Shitang Village Farmers' Association, directed the militia captain Qu Xuejin, militia member Qu Benli, and some other village cadres to arrest ten women in the village, including Huang Xiuqing, who were accused of having "poor conduct," claiming that they were "acting on orders from the district office." They also convened "struggle sessions" and used torture to force them to "confess." On May 30th, Huang Xiuqing was arrested first and forced to "confess." She was then forced to wear a tall hat and paraded through the streets under the pretext of "not confessing enough." She was repeatedly beaten during the parade. After the parade, she was forced to stand in the sun. That night, she was bound and detained at the Farmers' Association. On the third day, she was again forced to "confess" and subjected to the "sharp finger torture" in public until her fingernails turned purplish-black. On the same day, the woman Qu Liumei was also arrested and taken to a mass meeting to be subjected to the "sharp finger torture." She was confined for one night after the torture. Subsequently, the women Shi Yuejin, Huang Xiulian, and Qu Ermei were also arrested and similarly subjected to "sharp finger torture" in public. Shi Yuejin's left thumb was broken off at the time. When Huang Xiulian was being tortured, Qu Xuejin and Qu Benli forced her husband's younger brother, Qu Bencheng, to do it. They threatened Qu Bencheng, saying, "If you don't do it, you are harboring her, and you will be tortured first!" Qu Bencheng was then forced to torture his own sister-in-law. On June 3rd, the women Chen Yuechang, Chen Xiuren, Wen Xiuguang, and Liang Xiuqing were also arrested. They tied up Chen Yuechang and confined her for one night. They also tied up Chen Xiuren and strangled her neck with a rope, almost to the point of suffocation. After Wen Xiuguang was tied up, Qu Benli threatened her fiercely: "Tell me! Do you want your hand or your foot broken? If you don't tell me, I'll hang you from the beam! If you really don't tell me, I'll step on you with red-hot bricks after you're hanging. The district chief has given me the order. Everyone has to be beaten, no matter what!" On June 5th, Qu Benchu's married daughter was also arrested and hung up and beaten along with Chen Yuechang, Shi Yuejin, and others at night. Liang Xiuqing was again forced to confess and threatened with "burning with kerosene." Shi Yuejin was hung up until she was unconscious before being put down, and then she was beaten again. On June 6th, Lu Xiuren was tied up and slapped nine times in the face for being dissatisfied with the cadres' behavior. She was released after admitting her "mistake." These women were all released only after being forced to confess to "poor conduct," promising to take the cadres to find their "lovers," and "confessing" in public.

The illegal actions of Qu Jizhao and others in arresting and hanging women aroused opposition from many people. For example, when Qu Liumei was being tortured so miserably, Qu Naiying's wife criticized this atrocity. Qu Benli grabbed her hands and shouted, "Tie her up!" When Huang Xiulian was being tortured, her grandmother said to the cadres, "If you break her hand, who will support me?" The perpetrators yelled and cursed and tried to tie her up as well. On June 4th, the farmer Qu Tiantai went to the Farmers' Association and saw Qu Benli threatening the arrested women, and he criticized them for not acting in accordance with policy. The village cadres shouted wildly and wanted to take him to the district government.

After the incident, the perpetrators tried their best to block the news. After Shi Yuejin was released, she wanted to report to the district government, but the village cadres found out. They found her and threatened her, saying, "Go ahead and report! If anything bad happens to our village cadres, we will level your whole family!" On June 12th, Qu Benli passed by Wen Xiuguang's door and shouted, "If you say I oppressed you, I'll take your head!" The villagers were threatened by the village cadres and dared not speak out. Although the county people's government knew that there had been illegal acts of arresting women and parading them through the streets in Shitang Village, it only regarded it as "a general problem of the work style of village cadres" and did not investigate it. The district government did not even know that this had happened. It was not until mid-June, when a staff member of the county public security bureau surnamed Qu went to the third district to deal with accumulated cases and received a written complaint from the women Shi Yuejin and others, that he learned the full story. The county people's court then sent cadres to Shitang Village with the district cadres to deal with the matter on the spot. On July 24th, the principal offender Qu Jizhao and the active accomplice Qu Benli were detained and sentenced to four months and three months of imprisonment respectively. Other accomplices were criticized and educated in public. (Originally published in Guangxi Daily)

Editor's Note: We believe that the sentence imposed by the People's Court of Yongchun County, Guangxi, on the criminals in this case is too light. Imposing only three or four months of imprisonment on people who have committed such lawless crimes is by no means sufficient to appease public anger, nor can it guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future. The county people's court should consider re-examining it.

### 广西永淳县式堂村干部屈济朝等  非法对十个妇女施用毒刑  县人民法院判刑太轻应重新处理

    广西永淳县式堂村干部屈济朝等
    非法对十个妇女施用毒刑
    县人民法院判刑太轻应重新处理
    广西省永淳县第三区式堂村发生村干部侵犯人权、非法逮捕、吊打妇女的严重事件。
    今年五月三十日至六月六日，式堂村农会主任屈济朝指挥民兵队长屈学进、民兵屈本礼和另一些村干部，假称“奉区公所命令”，将村中所谓“作风不好”的妇女黄秀清等十人逮捕，并召开“斗争会”，用毒刑逼迫“坦白”。五月三十日，黄秀清首先被捕，被逼“坦白”。又以“不够坦白”为名，强迫戴高帽游街。游街中并屡遭毒打。游街后又被弄到太阳地里去晒。当夜又绑押在农会住址。第三天又被逼“坦白”，并当众上“尖手刑”，直到指甲变成紫黑色。同日，妇女屈六妹又被捕，带到群众大会上去上“尖手刑”。上刑后被禁闭一夜。接着，妇女施月金、黄秀莲、屈二妹也相继被捕，同样当众施以“尖手刑”。施月金的左手拇指当时被折断一节。在向黄秀莲施刑时，屈学进、屈本礼硬逼她的夫弟屈本成动手。他们威吓屈本成说：“你不做就是包庇，先给你上刑！”屈本成乃被迫向自己的嫂嫂施刑。六月三日，妇女陈月嫦、陈秀仁、文秀光、梁秀清也被逮捕。他们把陈月嫦绑起来禁闭了一夜。又把陈秀仁绑起，用绳猛勒她的脖颈，几至断气。文秀光被绑后，屈本礼凶恶地威吓她：“你说吧！你想手断还是脚断？不说吊你上梁去！若真不说，吊上去后给你烧红的火砖踩。区长有字给我。上级指示那个都得打，不说就打！”六月五日，屈本初已出嫁的女儿也被捕，夜晚与陈月嫦、施月金等同被吊打。梁秀清再度被逼坦白，并被以“火油烧”相威吓。施月金直被吊到不醒人事时才放在地上，醒后又遭毒打。六月六日，陆秀仁因不满干部作风，也被绑起，挨了九个耳光，经认“错”后才释放。这些妇女，都是在被逼招认“作风不好”、答应带干部去找“奸夫”、并当众“坦白”之后才被释放。
    屈济朝等逮捕、吊打妇女的非法行为，曾引起不少群众的反对。如当屈六妹被折磨得十分悲惨的时候，屈乃应的妻子曾对这种暴行加以指责。屈本礼却抓住她的双手喊道：“把她绑起来！”黄秀莲受刑时，她的祖母对干部说：“你们弄断她的手，谁来养活我？”行凶的村干部即大叫大骂，并要把她也绑起来。六月四日，农民屈天泰到农民协会看到屈本礼正威胁被捕妇女，就批评他们不该不按政策办事。村干部却狂喊着要把他捉到区政府去。
    事件发生后，行凶的村干部极力封锁消息。施月金被释放后想去区政府报告，被村干部发觉了。他们把她找来威胁说：“你们去报告吧！如果我们村干部有个好歹，就铲平你们全家！”六月十二日，屈本礼经过文秀光家的门口时狂喊：“你要说我压迫你，就要你的脑袋！”本村群众受了村干部的威胁，不敢往外说。县人民政府虽然知道式堂村有过捉妇女游街的不法行为，也只认为是“一般村干部作风问题”，而未追究。区政府竟不知有此事发生。直到六月中，县公安局一位姓屈的工作人员到第三区处理积案，接到妇女施月金等人的控诉书后，才了解了全部案情。县人民法院乃派干部协同区干部同到式堂村就地处理。七月二十四日，将主犯屈济朝与积极从犯屈本礼扣押，分别判处徒刑四个月与三个月。其他从犯当众予以批评教育。（原载广西日报）
    编者按：广西永淳县人民法院对这一案件中的凶犯们的处刑，我们认为是太轻的。对犯有这样无法无天罪行的人，仅判三、四个月的徒刑决不足以平民愤，也不能保证以后不发生同样事件。该县人民法院应考虑重新加以处理。
