Editor's Note: This is a conversation with First Lieutenant Berry A. Dawson, an American Air Force pilot captured by the Korean People's Army. On September 4th of this year, Dawson was shot down by Korean People's Army soldiers with rifles while piloting an American aircraft bombing and strafing peaceful Korean villages near Yangdeok. He was taken prisoner. In this conversation, he exposed the atrocities of American aerial bandits slaughtering peaceful Korean residents and the crimes of American aggressors abusing and killing captured Korean People's Army personnel. This conversation was originally published in the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" on October 30, 1951.

    After receiving the order to bomb the vicinity of Yangdeok, I took off from Iwakuni Air Base in Japan. When I reached the airspace over Yangdeok, the ground anti-aircraft fire was so intense that I simply couldn't find a target to bomb.

    My aircraft was hit by many bullets, and the sound of the bullets hitting the aircraft panicked me. I turned the aircraft around to escape the barrage, but it was too late. A small rifle bullet hit the fuel tank, and it immediately caught fire. After I parachuted to the ground, I was captured by the People's Army.

    At that time, I was worried that the People's Army would definitely kill me, but they didn't threaten me at all, so I felt relieved. Later, I was sent to a prisoner of war camp.

    Before being captured, I had been serving in the light bomber squadron at Iwakuni Air Base in Japan. Many of the pilots at Iwakuni Air Base had bombed Germany with me during World War II. They didn't know why they had to bomb Korea.

    Therefore, after we came to the airspace over Korea, if the anti-aircraft fire was too heavy, we often just dropped our bombs without regard to whether there was a target and turned back. Only in rural areas and small mountain gullies where there was no anti-aircraft fire could we accurately bomb targets. We would first drop incendiary bombs in the center of these villages and then strafe the children and old people who were fleeing with machine guns.

    Our superiors ordered us to destroy everything that moved in Korea, whether it was people or animals. The superior officers who gave us these orders were extremely brutal.

    The soldiers would drink every night, get drunk and chat aimlessly to pass the time, or go to find women near the base, or beat each other to get through the day.

    On average, two aircraft a day that took off from this airbase to bomb Korea never returned. Whenever this happened, the soldiers' fear of death became even greater. In particular, Lieutenant Robertston always wore a worried look on his pale face because of the threat of death to him.

    While in the unit, I heard the duty officer say that we were sending captured People's Army personnel and captured "refugees" to be used as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. He also said that there was a ship with special equipment on the south coast of Korea that was using captured People's Army personnel for bacteriological weapons experiments.

    In addition, in American military hospitals in Japan, captured People's Army personnel were also assigned to be used for anatomical research.

    In order to destroy Korean farmland, pests are being cultivated in many research institutes to be spread in the fields; special incendiary bombs specifically for burning grain are also being manufactured.

    Now, in the prisoner of war camp, I am treated very generously by the Korean people and have also received a lot of education.

    Comparing the cruelty of the war of aggression with the happy life of peace, I feel that we should abandon the path that leads us to death. I have infinite resentment towards the bellicose rulers in our country who owe such a blood debt. We long for the early arrival of peace.

    Whenever I think of my poor wife and children left at home, I hope that the Korean War will end soon so that I can go home. I am not the only one with this hope; this is the hope of all American youths who have been dragged here as cannon fodder.

### 美军俘虏谈美国侵略者的罪行

    美军俘虏谈美国侵略者的罪行
    编者按：这是被朝鲜人民军俘虏的美国空军中尉贝里·艾·道逊的谈话。今年九月四日，道逊驾驶的一架美国飞机，在对阳德附近的朝鲜和平村庄施行轰炸与扫射时，被朝鲜人民军战士用步枪击落，道逊被俘。他在这篇谈话中，揭露了美国空中强盗屠杀朝鲜和平居民的暴行和美国侵略者虐杀朝鲜人民军被俘人员的罪行。这篇谈话原载一九五一年十月三十日朝鲜“劳动新闻”。
    我接到了轰炸阳德附近的命令以后，就从日本的岩国飞机场起飞。到了阳德上空，地面上的高射炮火是那样猛烈，简直使我无法找到目标进行轰炸。
    我的飞机机身上中了很多枪弹，枪弹打在飞机身上发出来的声响把我吓慌了。我掉转了机头想逃出火网，但已经晚了，油箱上中了一个小小的步枪子弹，马上着起火来，我跳伞落地后就被人民军俘虏了。
    当时，我担心人民军一定会弄死我的，但他们并没给我一点威胁，于是我放心了。以后我就被送进 了俘虏营。
    在被俘以前，我一直是在日本岩国飞机场轻轰炸机大队内服务的。岩国飞机场里有很多是曾经在第二次世界大战中与我一起轰炸过德国的飞行员，他们都不知道为什么要去轰炸朝鲜。
    因此，在我们来到朝鲜上空后，如果高射炮火太厉害，往往不管有没有目标，把炸弹扔下以后就转回去了。只有在没有高射炮火的农村和小山沟里，才能对准目标轰炸。我们先在这些村庄中心扔下燃烧弹，然后再用机枪扫射那些逃出来的小孩和老人们。
    上级命令我们把朝鲜一切能动的东西，不管是人或是动物，都要毁灭掉。下这些命令给我们的上级军官们，真是凶残到了极点。
    士兵们一到晚上就去喝酒，喝醉以后就互相乱谈着鬼混时间，或是到部队附近去找女人，再不就是相互殴打着过日子。
    从这个飞机场起飞去朝鲜轰炸的飞机，平均每天总有两架回不来。每当这种事情发生的时候，士兵们对于死的恐怖就更加厉害。特别是劳勃特逊中尉，由于死对于他的威胁，他那苍白的脸上总是带着愁容。
    在部队里的时候，我听值勤官说，我们把人民军被俘人员和抓来的“难民”，送去做细菌武器的试验品。他并且说：在朝鲜南海岸有一只装有特别设备的船上，正在把人民军被俘人员作细菌武器的试验。
    另外，在日本的美军医院里，人民军被俘人员也被分配用来作解剖学的研究。
    为了毁坏朝鲜的农田，在许多研究所里正在培育准备往农田里散布的害虫；专门用来烧毁粮食的特别燃烧弹也正在制造中。
    我现在在俘虏营里受到朝鲜人民非常宽大的待遇，并且也受到了很多的教育。
    我把侵略战争的残酷性与和平幸福的生活对比了一下，觉得我们应该抛开使我们走向死亡的道路。我对欠下了这种血债的我们国家里的好战的统治者们，抱有无限的愤恨。我们渴望着和平的早日到来。
    我每当想起我那留在家里的可怜的老婆和孩子的时候，就希望早日停止朝鲜战争，好回家去。有着这种希望的人不仅仅是我一个人，这也是所有被拉来做炮灰的美国青年的希望。
