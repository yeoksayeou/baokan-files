The Grain Bureau of the Finance Department of the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office held the First Model Representative Conference of Grain Workers in Wuxi City from November 13th to 18th. At the meeting, Qian Sunqing, Deputy Director of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office, commended the 144 model grain preservation worker representatives present and called on them to further develop their enthusiasm and creativity in their work, respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and ensure the safety of state public grain and the smooth completion of this autumn grain requisition and storage task.

Over the past year, the grain depot preservation work in Southern Jiangsu has made great achievements. This year, inspired by the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement, grain workers throughout the region launched a patriotic grain preservation competition. After inventorying warehouses and clearing accounts, they achieved consistency between warehouse grain and grain accounts, completed a huge amount of transportation work, and, more importantly, overcame natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, rats, sparrows, and insect pests, as well as sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements, and basically completed the task of ensuring the safety of public grain. According to statistics from January to September this year, the public grain lost in the region's granaries accounted for only 0.047% of the total grain reserves, which is only 0.7‰ of the total public grain losses in 1949 and 1950.

At this representative conference, grain preservation models from various places reported on their exemplary deeds and work experience and formulated plans for doing a good job in grain work in the future. Before the closing of the meeting, all the models unanimously passed a letter to Chairman Mao, which said: "We warmly respond to your call for increasing production and practicing economy, and we will unite all the grain cadres in Southern Jiangsu to do a good job. We guarantee to do a good job in this autumn grain requisition, storage, and future grain storage work; earnestly practice economy, further save expenses, and reduce the loss of public grain."

Xinhua News Agency: Wang Shengbao, a grain protection model of the Southern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Grain Corporation, has saved the state an estimated 300,000 jin of rice in half a year since he led the employees of the Hongchang Grain Depot in launching a grain protection movement in May of this year.

Wang Shengbao is a grain depot porter with 33 years of work experience and is the deputy chairman of the grassroots committee of the Hongchang First Grain Depot Porter's Union in Wuxi City. Hongchang First Grain Depot is one of the larger private grain depots in Wuxi City and has been leased entirely to the Southern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Grain Corporation since liberation. Wang Shengbao participated in the anti-feudal foreman struggle this spring, and later listened to the reports of the returning representatives of the volunteers, which improved his class consciousness. He was determined to do a good job in grain storage work and actively put forward many valuable suggestions in his work. He suggested to the union that after unloading a warehouse of grain, the workers should concentrate their efforts on catching rats, which the union adopted. In the first month after this method was trialed, the workers caught 1,700 rats, and more than 8,000 rats in half a year. According to workers' estimates, based on an average of 23 jin of grain consumed by each rat per year, more than 92,000 jin of rice has been saved for the country in half a year. In addition, Wang Shengbao also suggested: installing bamboo canopies and bamboo curtains between the eaves and windows of the warehouse to prevent sparrows from flying in; dredging the ditches in the drying yard and compartments to prevent rainwater from overflowing; removing weevils parasitizing in the warehouse walls; sealing all insect and rat holes in the warehouse walls with lime and iron sheets, and so on. The implementation of these suggestions has avoided a large loss of grain for the country.

Wang Shengbao can also lead by example and play a leading role in grain storage work. During the rainy summer season, he often stayed up all night, holding a flashlight and a short ladder, carefully checking whether there was any rainwater leaking into the warehouse. Once he found more than 80 leaking places, marked them all with lime water, and used water-holding utensils to catch the water one by one. The workers of Hongchang First Grain Depot were deeply moved by his spirit of loving the property of the motherland and actively protected the grain.

Wang Shengbao understands that grain protection work can only be done well by mobilizing all employees to work together, so he attaches great importance to publicity work. He often compares all the rats, sparrows, and insect pests that damage grain to enemies harming the new China, inspiring the workers' enthusiasm for protecting the property of the motherland. Under his encouragement, the employees took grain protection work as practical work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and launched a grain protection movement.

In order to make grain protection a regular movement, at Wang Shengbao's suggestion, the employees of Hongchang First Grain Depot established a grain protection committee and formulated a patriotic grain protection covenant. All employees of the depot were divided into six groups, each responsible for storing grain; at the same time, an inspection and statistical system was also established, with the grain depot resident, the grain depot manager, and all the depot employees taking turns each week to be responsible for checking the temperature, humidity, and other conditions of the grain to discover problems in time and deal with them.

Under Wang Shengbao's leadership, the employees of Hongchang First Grain Depot have saved the country an estimated 300,000 jin of rice in the past six months. Therefore, Wang Shengbao was elected as a grain protection model for all grain depots under the Southern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Grain Corporation in September of this year. Wang Shengbao's grain protection experience has been widely promoted by the Southern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Grain Corporation in state-owned grain depots in the Southern Jiangsu region.

    苏南一百多名保粮模范受表扬
    九个月全区损失公粮只占全部存粮的万分之零点四七
    工人王生宝半年为国家免除了三十万斤稻子的损耗
    苏南人民行政公署财政处粮食局，十一月十三日到十八日在无锡市召开了第一届粮食工作人员模范代表会议。会上，苏南行署副主任钱孙卿表扬了到会的一百四十四名保粮模范工作者代表，并号召他们进一步发挥工作的积极性和创造性，响应毛主席增产节约号召，确保国家公粮安全和顺利完成这次秋征接粮入库的任务。
    一年来，苏南区仓库保粮工作有很大成绩。今年，全区粮食工作者在抗美援朝运动的鼓舞下，开展爱国主义的保粮竞赛运动，经过查仓清账，做到了仓粮和粮账一致，完成了数量巨大的调运工作，更重要的是战胜了台风、水灾、鼠、雀、虫害等自然灾害和反革命分子的破坏，基本上完成了确保公粮安全的任务。据今年一月到九月的统计：全区粮仓损失的公粮只占全部存粮的万分之零点四七，只是一九四九年和一九五零年两年公粮损失总数的千分之七。
    在这次代表会上，各地保粮模范报告了他们的模范事迹和工作经验，并订出了今后做好粮食工作的计划。会议闭幕前，全体模范一致通过了给毛主席写信，信上说：“我们热烈响应您提出来的增产节约的号召，一定团结全苏南区的粮食干部，做好工作。我们保证做好这次秋征接粮入仓和今后的粮食保管工作；切实节约，进一步节省经费开支和减少公粮的损耗。”（新华社）
    中国粮食公司苏南分公司护粮模范王生宝，自今年五月领导宏昌粮栈职工开展护粮运动以来，半年中已为国家免除了三十万斤稻子的损耗。
    王生宝是一个有三十三年工龄的粮栈搬运工人，是无锡市宏昌第一粮栈搬运工会基层委员会副主席。宏昌第一粮栈是无锡市规模较大的私营粮栈之一，解放后全部为中国粮食公司苏南分公司租用。王生宝在今年春季参加了反封建把头斗争，后来又听了志愿军归国代表的报告，阶级觉悟提高，下决心要做好粮食保管工作，并在工作中积极地提出了许多宝贵的建议。他向工会提出了发动工人在挑完一仓粮食后集中力量捕鼠的建议，工会采纳了。这个办法试行后的第一个月内，工人们捉到老鼠一千七百只，半年内共捕鼠八千多只。据工人估计，以每只老鼠一年吃粮平均二十三斤计算，半年内已为国家避免损失九万二千多斤稻子。此外，王生宝还提议：在仓房的屋檐间和窗口装上竹天幔和竹帘，防止麻雀飞入；疏通晒场和隔弄里的水沟，防止雨水溢进；剔清寄生在仓壁中的蛀虫；将所有仓壁中的虫洞和鼠洞用石灰、铁皮堵塞起来等等。这些建议实施后，都为国家避免了大量粮食的损失。
    王生宝在粮食保管工作中还能以身作则，起带头作用。夏季多雨，下雨时他经常彻夜不眠，拿着手电筒和短梯，仔细察看仓房有无雨水漏进。有一次他发现了八十多处漏水的地方，都用石灰水涂上了记号，并拿盛水用具一一接住。宏昌第一粮栈的工人们都被他这种热爱祖国财产的精神深深感动，积极保护粮食。
    王生宝明白，必须发动全体职工一齐动手，才能作好护粮工作，因此他非常重视宣传工作。他常把一切损坏粮食的鼠雀虫害，比作危害新中国的敌人，激发工人爱护祖国财产的热情。在他的鼓动下，职工们都把护粮工作作为抗美援朝的实际工作，展开了护粮运动。
    为了使护粮成为经常性的运动，在王生宝建议下，宏昌第一粮栈职工成立了护粮委员会，订立了爱国护粮公约。全栈职工分成六个小组，分工负责保管粮食；同时，还建立了检查统计制度，每星期由粮食公司驻仓员、粮栈管理员和全栈职工轮流负责检查粮食的温度、湿度和其他情况，以便及时发现问题，加以处理。
    在王生宝领导下，半年来宏昌第一粮栈职工已为国家免除了稻子损耗估计有三十万斤。因此，王生宝已在今年九月间被选为中国粮食公司苏南分公司所属各粮栈的护粮模范。王生宝的护粮经验，已由中国粮食公司苏南分公司在苏南区国家粮栈中普遍推行。（新华社）
