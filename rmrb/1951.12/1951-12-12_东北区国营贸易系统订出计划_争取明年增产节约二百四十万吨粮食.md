Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th—The state-owned trade system in Northeast China plans to launch a patriotic labor competition among its employees, striving to complete and exceed the task of increasing production and saving the equivalent of 2.4 million tons of grain in 1952. The Northeast China state-owned trade system plans to shorten the average capital turnover period of the entire Northeast state-owned trade system by seven days by strengthening financial management and accelerating capital turnover, saving the state investment equivalent to 1.4 million tons of grain; to increase production and save 700,000 tons of grain by improving business management, reducing commodity circulation costs, and increasing labor efficiency; to increase production and save 240,000 tons of grain for the country by tapping the potential of its affiliated production enterprises, increasing output, improving quality, reducing costs, and improving processing and ordering work; and to increase production and save 60,000 tons of grain for the country by improving the management of basic construction projects, rationally allocating basic construction investment, and improving project quality.
    In order to accomplish the above tasks of increasing production and saving, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast China Store Employees' Union have instructed the state-owned trade departments and store employees' unions of each province and city to launch a thorough inspection of past work by employees of various specialized companies before the end of this year, identify key issues for increasing production and saving, and formulate annual and quarterly plans for increasing production and saving for each unit next year. Each trade union group will also formulate group or individual patriotic production increase and conservation plans when revising patriotic covenants.

    东北区国营贸易系统订出计划
    争取明年增产节约二百四十万吨粮食
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北区国营贸易系统计划在职工中发动爱国主义劳动竞赛，争取一九五二年完成和超过增产节约价值相当于二百四十万吨粮食的任务。东北区国营贸易系统计划明年从加强财务管理、加速资金周转方面，争取全东北国营贸易系统资金周转期平均缩短七天，为国家节约价值相当于一百四十万吨粮食的投资；从改进经营管理、降低商品流转费用、提高劳动效率方面，增产节约七十万吨粮食；从发挥所属各生产企业的潜在能力、增加产量、提高质量、降低成本和改进加工订货工作方面，为国家增产节约二十四万吨粮食；此外，从改进基本建设工程的管理、合理分配基本建设的投资、提高工程质量方面，为国家增产节约六万吨粮食。
    东北人民政府贸易部和东北区店员工会为完成上述增产节约任务，已责成各省、各市国营贸易部门和店员工会在今年年底以前发动各专业公司职工彻底检查过去的工作，找出增产节约的关键问题，制订各单位明年全年和各季度的增产节约计划。各工会小组也将在修订爱国公约时拟订小组的或个人的爱国增产节约计划。
