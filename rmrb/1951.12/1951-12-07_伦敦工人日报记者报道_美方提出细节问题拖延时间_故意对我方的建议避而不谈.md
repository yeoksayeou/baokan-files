    Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: London "Worker's Daily" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 5th: According to observers here, the U.S. side is again delaying time in the subcommittee. Observers say that no irrelevant questions should be raised to the Korean and Chinese side now. In the past two days, the U.S. side has raised forty written questions and many oral questions. The Korean and Chinese side has answered all of these. However, the U.S. side has not expressed any opinions on the actual principles in the very clear proposals of the Korean and Chinese side, which are to limit the input of troops and weapons and to conduct inspections by neutral countries. Inside the meeting tent, Hodge was busy asking questions, and the representatives of the Korean and Chinese side patiently answered these questions. Hodge asked for clarification: When will the neutral countries be invited? When will their representatives arrive? Can they arrive within sixty days? (Why sixty days?) Hodge insisted on discussing the issues that both sides had already agreed upon word by word, but avoided talking about the unresolved issues. Yesterday and today, the Korean and Chinese side had to repeat very obvious issues again, emphasize them, explain them in detail, and resolve seemingly endless questions that were irrelevant to the topic. It is believed here that the U.S. side should have expressed their attitude towards the proposals of the Korean and Chinese side long ago, and should no longer use the method of discussing details to shelve these proposals.

    美方提出细节问题拖延时间
    故意对我方的建议避而不谈
    【新华社六日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿五日自板门店报道：据此间观察家说：美方又在小组委员会中拖延时间。观察家说，现在不应再向朝中方面提出无关的问题了。在过去两天中，美方提出了四十个书面问题和许多口头问题。这些问题大部分都是关于技术细节的，朝中方面已全部予以答复了。但美方对朝中方面非常清楚的建议中的实际原则，一点意见都没有表示，这些原则是限制输入军队和武器以及由中立国进行视察。在会议帐篷内，霍治忙乱地提问题，朝中方面代表对这些问题都耐心地解答了。霍治要求说明：什么时候邀请中立国？它们的代表什么时候来？他们能够在六十天内到达吗？（为什么六十天？）霍治坚持把双方已经同意的问题逐字讨论，而对未决的问题却避而不谈。昨天和今天，朝中方面不得不把很明显的问题再重复一遍并加以强调，细微末节地详加解释，并解决了看起来无穷尽的与正题无关的问题。此间认为，美方早就应该对朝中方面的建议表示他们的态度，而不应再用讨论细节的办法把这个建议搁置起来。
