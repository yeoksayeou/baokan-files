China National Grain Corporation Shandong Provincial Company

Blind Transfers Cause Waste

The Shandong Provincial Company of the China National Grain Corporation's commodity circulation expenses from January to June this year totaled over 60 billion yuan, accounting for 15.54% of the net circulation amount, exceeding the control figure of the East China Grain Corporation by 0.08% (adding interest, it exceeds it by 4.12%). The main reason for the overspending is the company's inadequate planning for allocation and storage. For example, the Dezhou Branch transported 20,000 jin of rice to Yanshan, but because it could not be sold, it was transferred to Chaihudian, wasting 1.28 million yuan in transportation costs. The Qingdao Branch's Gaomi Sub-branch failed to grasp the sales and storage plans for wheat in its jurisdiction of the Pushang operating group. At the end of October last year, the majority of wheat was transferred to Qingdao. When the local wheat market fluctuated in April of this year, and there was no wheat to sell, 7,000 jin of wheat were urgently transferred from Gaomi to stabilize the market, wasting 310,000 yuan in transportation costs.

The Qingdao and Xinpu branches adopted a "sell as you transport" and "piecemeal allocation" approach to the Cangku Branch, resulting in the use of automobile transportation, which is more than twice as expensive as train transportation, in urgent sales situations.

### 中国粮食公司山东省公司  盲目调运造成浪费

    中国粮食公司山东省公司
    盲目调运造成浪费
    中国粮食公司山东省公司，今年一至六月的商品流转费共六百多亿元，占纯流转额百分之十五点五四，超过华东区粮食公司控制数字百分之点零八（加上利息则超过百分之四点一二）。超支原因主要是由于该公司调拨、储运计划不周。如德州分公司将二万斤大米运到盐山后，因不能销售，又转调柴胡店，浪费运费一百二十八万元。青岛分公司所属高密支公司不能掌握所辖浦上经营组的销储小麦计划，于去年十月底将该处小麦大部调往青岛，到本年四月份该地小麦市场波动，无麦可销时，为了稳定市场又急从高密调来小麦七千斤，浪费运费三十一万元。
    青岛、新浦两分公司对所属沧口支公司采取现卖现运、零星调拨，以致在急需销售的情况下，不能不使用汽车运输，运费较火车高一倍以上。
