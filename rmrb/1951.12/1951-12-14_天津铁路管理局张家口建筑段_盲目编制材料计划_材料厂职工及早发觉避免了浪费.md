    Zhangjiakou Construction Section of Tianjin Railway Bureau
    Blindly Prepared Material Plan
    Material Factory Workers Discovered It Early and Prevented Waste
    The workers of the Zhangjiakou Material Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau were conscientious and responsible in checking materials, and they discovered and prevented the waste that might have been caused by the Zhangjiakou Construction Section's blindly prepared material plan.
    In late May of this year, Wan Qingquan, the director of the technical office of the Zhangjiakou Construction Section of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, without properly understanding the production tasks and financial budget of the Construction Section for the third quarter, blindly listed 116 kinds of materials in varying quantities as the material plan for the third quarter and submitted it to the section chief. At that time, the Construction Section was holding a meeting of the directors of all its stationed offices. Section Chief Yuan Min asked the directors of each stationed office to submit a list of materials needed for the third quarter at the meeting. They only flipped through the material catalog and submitted another 166 kinds of materials. After receiving these material lists, Zhai Yancai, the director of the material office of the Construction Section, not only did not analyze and study them, but also mistakenly pieced together 874 kinds of temporary materials, which according to the regulations should not have been included in the third-quarter plan, proposed by the stationed offices in the past. They drafted the material plan for the third quarter in such a hasty manner. This plan, after being stamped by the section chief, was sent to the engineering section of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau. Gong Zengxin, the acting chief of the finance and material section of the engineering section, stamped it as usual and sent it to the section chief. Shi Zhongkun, the chief of the engineering section, did not carefully review it and forwarded it to the Zhangjiakou Material Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau for verification and distribution on the same day. In mid-August, although the leading cadres of the Construction Section had discovered that the plan they had prepared exceeded the actual needs, they did not revise it because they consistently held the "better too much than too little" idea of "loose planning and tight use."
    At the end of August, when the staff of the planning and allocation section of the Zhangjiakou Material Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau were verifying the materials for various units, they used various methods to investigate and finally discovered this unrealistic plan of the Zhangjiakou Construction Section. After verification and reduction by the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, the 874 kinds of materials listed in the third-quarter material plan of the Construction Section were reduced to 134 kinds; the value of the materials was reduced from 22.5088 billion yuan to 3.85722 billion yuan. Subsequent facts proved that the total value of materials actually used by the Zhangjiakou Construction Section in the third quarter was only 2.57396 billion yuan. If the material factory had supplied materials according to the original plan of the Construction Section at that time, it would have overstocked 19.93 billion yuan of state funds.
    In order to promote the enthusiasm of employees to oppose waste and to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents, the Tianjin Railway Bureau has rewarded and punished the relevant personnel in mid-October. The staff of the planning and allocation section of the Zhangjiakou Material Factory were collectively commended with a minor meritorious service for their contribution to verifying the plan; Zhai Yancai, the director of the material office of the Zhangjiakou Construction Section, was given a major demerit, and other relevant personnel who caused the errors were also given different levels of punishment. The Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau issued a circular to the entire bureau on this incident on October 18. The circular pointed out that the error of the Zhangjiakou Construction Section showed that they lacked a responsible attitude towards state property; it also proved that there was still a bureaucratic work style in the leadership departments at all levels of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau. The circular requested all employees in all departments to discuss this incident, link it to the specific situation of each unit, and conduct in-depth inspections.

    天津铁路管理局张家口建筑段
    盲目编制材料计划
    材料厂职工及早发觉避免了浪费
    天津铁路管理局张家口材料厂职工查核材料认真负责，及早发觉并避免了张家口建筑段因盲目编制材料计划所可能造成的浪费。
    今年五月底，张家口铁路分局张家口建筑段技术室主任万清泉，事先没有很好地了解建筑段第三季度的生产任务和财务预算，就盲目地开列了数量不等的一百十六种材料，作为第三季度材料计划，送交段长。当时建筑段正召开所属各驻在所主任会议。段长袁敏就让各驻在所主任在会上提出第三季度用料清单。他们也只翻了翻材料目录，就又提出材料一百六十六种。建筑段材料室主任翟彦才接到这些用料清单后，不但没有分析研究，并且又错误地把各驻在所过去所提出的、按制度不应列入第三季度计划的临时用料，拼凑成数量不等的八百七十四种材料。他们就这样草率地制定了第三季的材料计划。这一计划经段长盖章送张家口铁路分局工务科，工务科财务材料股代理股长龚增鑫照例盖章送给科长，工务科长石中崑也没仔细审核，当天就转送天津铁路管理局张家口材料厂核发。八月中旬，建筑段领导干部虽已发现了自己编制的计划超过实际需要，但由于他们一贯有“宁可多了，不要少了”的“宽打窄用”思想，也没修正。
    八月底，天津铁路管理局张家口材料厂计配股职工在核发各单位用料时，用各种办法进行查考，最后发现了张家口建筑段这个不合实际的计划。经过张家口铁路分局核减的结果，建筑段第三季度材料计划中所列的八百七十四种材料被核减为一百三十四种；材料价值由二百二十五亿零八百八十多万元核减到三十八亿五千七百二十二万多元。以后的事实证明：张家口建筑段第三季度实用材料总值不过二十五亿七千三百九十六万元。如果材料厂当时按照建筑段的原计划供料，就要积压国家资金一百九十九亿三千多万元。
    为发扬职工反对浪费的积极性，并杜绝类似事件的发生，天津铁路管理局已在十月中分别奖励和处分了有关人员。张家口材料厂计配股职工因核对计划有功，集体记小功一次；张家口建筑段材料室主任翟彦才记大过一次，其他造成错误的有关人员，也受到轻重不同的处分。张家口铁路分局在十月十八日曾就这一事件通报全局。通报指出，张家口建筑段的这一错误说明他们对待国家财富缺乏负责的态度；同时也证明张家口铁路分局的各级领导部门还存在着官僚主义作风。通报要求各部门全体职工讨论这一事件，联系各单位具体情况，深入检查。
