[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] All the public security personnel of Beijing Municipality wrote a letter to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee and the Beijing Municipal Third All-Circles People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, thanking the Municipal People's Government Committee and the Municipal Consultative Committee for their recent commendations and rewards. The original letter is as follows:

To Mayor Peng, to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee, to the Beijing Municipal Third All-Circles People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee:

We are very honored to receive your commendation and rewards! In the past two years, Beijing's work in suppressing counter-revolutionaries has indeed achieved great victories. This victory was achieved by our public security personnel under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and through the joint efforts of the people of the city. Therefore, this honor does not belong solely to the public security personnel, but mainly to Chairman Mao and the people of the city.

Although the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Beijing has been relatively thorough, the remnants of counter-revolutionaries have not been completely eliminated, and hidden enemies are still carrying out sabotage activities. The tasks facing us are still very arduous, and there are still some shortcomings and errors in our work. Some public security personnel have not yet fully served the people wholeheartedly, and even individual public security personnel have engaged in corruption, bribery, extortion, and taken advantage of their power to engage in illegal and undisciplined behavior. We deeply feel that any phenomenon of pride, complacency, and negligence due to victory is wrong. We will certainly follow your expectations, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be modest and prudent, strive to overcome shortcomings and mistakes, continuously improve, and heighten our vigilance in order to thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary remnants and safeguard the lives and property of the people of the capital.

Finally, we hope that you and the people of the city will provide frequent supervision and instructions for our work.

                Luo Ruiqing, Feng Jiping, Zhang Minghe, and all staff members of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, and all commanders and fighters of the Public Security Corps
                        December 24

    北京市全体公安工作人员
    写信感谢政府和人民对他们的表扬
    决彻底肃清反革命残余保卫首都人民生命财产安全
    【北京市新闻处讯】北京市全体公安工作人员给北京市人民政府委员会和北京市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会写了一封信，感谢市人民政府委员会和市协商委员会最近给他们的表扬和奖励。原信如下：彭市长转北京市人民政府委员会北京市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会：
    接到你们对于我们的表扬和奖励，感到非常光荣！两年来北京市的镇压反革命工作，确实取得了伟大的胜利，这个胜利是我们公安人员在毛主席、中国共产党北京市委员会、北京市人民政府的正确领导下并经过全市人民的共同努力而取得的。因此，这个光荣不单是属于公安人员，而主要的应当属于毛主席和全市人民。
    北京市镇压反革命工作，虽然做得比较彻底，但反革命残余还未完全肃清，隐蔽敌人还在进行破坏活动，摆在我们面前的任务还很艰巨，而在我们工作中也还有一些缺点和错误，有些公安人员还没有完全作到全心全意为人民服务，甚而个别公安人员还有贪污受贿敲诈勒索、依仗权势进行违法乱纪的行为。我们深深感到：任何因胜利而发生骄傲自满和疏忽大意的现象都是错误的，我们一定遵照你们的期望戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，努力克服缺点和错误，不断进步，并提高警惕，以期彻底肃清反革命残余，保卫首都人民生命财产的安全。
    最后，希望你们和全市人民对我们的工作经常予以监督和指示。
            北京市人民政府公安局罗瑞卿、冯基平、张明河暨全体工作人员及公安总队全体指战员
                    十二月二十四日
