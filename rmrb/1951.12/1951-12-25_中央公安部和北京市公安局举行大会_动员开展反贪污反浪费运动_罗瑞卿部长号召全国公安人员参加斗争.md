Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau held a cadre mobilization meeting on December 22nd to launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. More than 4,000 people attended. Minister Luo Ruiqing gave a mobilization report at the meeting on the issue of how the public security system should launch and carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. He said: "The people's public security organs are one of the important pillars of the people's democratic dictatorship. They are the power organs that protect national interests and defend the interests of the people, and they are an important link between the Party and the people. Therefore, our public security departments must stand at the forefront of this struggle, vigorously, resolutely, and thoroughly eliminate the corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic habits that exist within our organs and among some public security personnel." Luo Ruiqing pointed out that since the national victory, especially during the past year's great suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the public security departments have achieved great results. The majority of public security personnel have been loyal and courageous in the struggle against the enemy, and they have been disciplined, patriotic, and love the people. However, there are serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and violations of law and discipline in some of our organizations and among some personnel. After analyzing the reasons for the existence and development of these erroneous tendencies, he then proposed: To carry out this struggle within the public security system, it is necessary to widely launch mass movements within the organs, so that every cadre, police officer, and staff member can fully recognize ideologically that corruption and waste are illegal and shameful, and mobilize everyone to bravely report them; public security organs at all levels, especially in large and medium-sized cities, must widely mobilize people from all walks of life to report illegal acts such as corruption, bribery, and extortion by public security personnel and police officers. Minister Luo Ruiqing finally called on public security personnel across the country to mobilize, concentrate their firepower, and open fire on corruptionists, waste, and bureaucracy!

    罗瑞卿部长号召全国公安人员参加斗争
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府公安部、北京市人民政府公安局在二十二日举行反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动干部动员大会。到会四千余人。罗瑞卿部长在大会上就公安系统内应该开展、怎样开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争问题，做了动员报告。他说：“人民公安机关是人民民主专政的重要支柱之一，是保护国家利益、保卫人民利益的权力机关，是党和人民政府联系广大群众的重要纽带。因此，我们公安部门必须站在这个斗争的前面，大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地、坚决地肃清我们机关内部和一部分公安工作人员中存在的贪污浪费和官僚主义习气。”罗瑞卿指出，全国胜利以来，特别是过去一年伟大的镇压反革命运动中，公安部门的工作有很大成绩，多数公安人员在对敌斗争中是忠实而勇敢的，是守纪律、爱国家、爱人民的。但是在我们某些组织和一些人员中，是存在着严重的贪污浪费、违法乱纪的现象。他分析了这些错误倾向存在和得以发展的原因后，继即提出：在公安系统内进行这个斗争，要在机关内部广泛开展群众运动，使每一个干部员警及工作人员从思想上充分认识贪污浪费是违法的、可耻的，发动大家勇敢地检举；各级公安机关特别是大、中城市的公安机关，必须广泛发动社会各界人民检举公安人员和民警中贪污受贿和敲诈勒索等不法行为。罗瑞卿部长最后号召全国公安工作人员动员起来，集中火力，向贪污分子、浪费现象、官僚主义开火！
