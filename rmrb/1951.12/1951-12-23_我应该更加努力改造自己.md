    I Should Work Harder to Remold Myself
    Yu Fuchun, Professor of Physics, Peking University

    In the past, I was a person who did not care about politics, but I still considered myself very aloof. I was born into a family of a declining scholar-official class and was unconsciously poisoned by reactionary ideas. Initially, I knew nothing about the Soviet Union and did not care about its existence at all. My main thought was to climb up the ladder. I studied physics entirely based on personal interest, with the aim of becoming an expert and scholar, pursuing personal fame and status, earning more income, and living a better life. The old society gave me a way out, which was to go abroad.

    In essence, my "supra-political" stance was a position that acknowledged the legitimacy of the reactionary ruling class. The "purely technical viewpoint" that the ruling class deployed to paralyze the people's minds suited my taste very well. My living requirements depended on them. I didn't like any changes in society, so I was afraid of revolution. When the actions of the Kuomintang reactionary government had not yet affected my life goals, I would not oppose them. I ignored the tide of the Chinese people's revolution, so I believed the reactionary government's anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda. I thought that student movements were just students showing off and making trouble, and I didn't want to participate in them in order to maintain my aloofness. These things caused me to have a past psychology of not sympathizing with the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, and even more fearing revolution and bloodshed.

    Towards the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the corruption of the reactionary government caused me personal anxiety and hopelessness, which made me come into contact with progressive ideas. This was only one aspect of the combination of progressive ideas and my personal interests. At that time, I only realized that the Chinese Communist Party was helping the poor to stand up, could eliminate the unequal distribution of wealth in society, and could improve the deteriorating living conditions during the Anti-Japanese War. I did not fully understand the nature of the Chinese revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, I politely declined a colleague's offer to get me involved in the Party's underground work. My individualism would not find a way out through revolution, and I still strived to study in the United States. I opposed China taking the Soviet path and listened to the enemy's anti-Soviet propaganda.

    During my four and a half years in the United States, I still retained the "purely technical viewpoint." In politics, I only acted as an observer, opposing the Kuomintang reactionary government, and seeing clearly the internal corruption in the United States, but on many major issues, I still could not distinguish right from wrong. For example, regarding the issue of Yugoslavia, I did not understand why the Information Bureau of the Communist Parties of various countries condemned the Tito group. When the Korean War began, I also could not distinguish who was right and who was wrong, only resenting the arrogance of the Americans and feeling happy to see the Americans suffer a major defeat in Korea. Because I looked at the problem from a bourgeois standpoint, I could not clearly distinguish right from wrong.

    When I was preparing to return to the motherland this February, there was a contradiction in my mind. I thought: staying in the United States is serving the Americans, and returning to the motherland is always serving the Chinese people, so I should go back. However, I was somewhat greedy for the American-style material life. In the end, my patriotic thoughts prompted me to return.

    After returning to the motherland, what I saw and heard caused a huge change in my thinking. The lie of the American imperialists that there is no freedom in New China was completely shattered by the facts. I truly gained freedom only after returning to the motherland. All work comes from the people's conscious willingness. I understand the difference between mobilizing the masses and ordering the masses. I saw the great achievements of the motherland after liberation. I feel that a supra-political scientific worker should immediately wake up, demand to remold oneself, and make one's work suitable for the needs of the people. This is what I deeply feel. The report given by Comrade Yu Guangyuan at the Chinese Physical Society Congress held in Beijing this July gave me great inspiration. I began to realize that in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, science existed as a part of imperialist science. To liberate Chinese science, we must first remold ourselves. If I continue to carry out the set of research I did in the United States without establishing a firm position of serving the people wholeheartedly, I may very likely become a prisoner of science serving imperialism.

    This study movement has given me a great education. My views on the Soviet Union have been completely changed. After returning to China, although I knew that the Soviet Union had provided great help to our country's construction, I could not emotionally connect with the people of the Soviet Union and the leader of the Soviet people, Stalin. This is because I cannot look at problems from the standpoint of the working class. Recently, I studied Stalin's "The International Character of the October Revolution," and I realized that in the past, because of my class origin, I could not look at problems and analyze problems from the proletarian standpoint. Today, I gradually realize that the interests of the world proletariat are consistent, this revolutionary road was opened up by the Soviet proletariat, and our interests are consistent with those of the Soviet people. Therefore, I no longer have any doubts about the Soviet Union. This is manifested in my gradually liking to study Stalin's works. I think we should trust the Soviet Union. I think progress will only be made by digging out the roots of one's own erroneous views.

    I feel that this study movement is only a beginning for me, and I am determined to work harder and unremittingly to remold myself.

    我应该更加努力改造自己
   北京大学物理系教授  虞福春
    过去，我是一个不过问政治的人，但我还自以为很清高。我出身在一个没落的士大夫阶级的家庭，不自觉地受到反动思想的毒害。最初，我对苏联一无所知，完全不关心其存在。我的主要思想就是向上爬。我学物理学，完全基于个人的兴趣，其目的在于作专家、学者，追求个人名誉和地位，得多的收入和过好的生活。旧社会给我的一条出路就是出洋。
    本质上，我的“超政治”立场，是承认反动统治阶级合法地位的一种立场。统治阶级所布置的麻痹人民思想的“单纯技术观点”，是非常合乎我自己的口味的。我的生活要求，是依靠了他们。我不喜欢社会发生任何变动，因此害怕革命。当国民党反动政府所做所为，尚未影响我的人生目的时，我是不会反对他们的。我既无视中国人民革命的浪潮，于是对反动政府的反苏反共宣传，便信以为真。我认为学运是学生出风头闹风潮的行为，自己为了清高，不愿参与其间。这些就造成我过去不同情苏联和中国共产党的心理，更加畏惧革命，害怕流血。
    抗日战争末期，反动政府的贪污腐化所引起我个人生活的不安和无希望，才使我接触了进步思想。这只是进步思想和我个人利益能够结合的一面。当时我只认识到：中国共产党是帮助穷人翻身的，能消除社会上财富不均的现象，能改善抗日战争期间每况愈下的生活状况。我完全不认识中国共产党所领导的中国革命的性质。所以，我曾婉辞谢绝一位同事争取我参加党的地下工作。我的个人主义思想，不会向革命找出路，仍争取到美国去留学。我反对中国要走苏联的路子，听信敌人的反苏宣传。
    在美国的四年半期间，我仍保留着“单纯技术观点”。在政治方面，只作一个旁观者，反对国民党反动政府，看清楚美国内部腐败的情形，但在许多重大问题上，我还不能辨别是非。例如，关于南斯拉夫问题，我不明白为什么各国共产党情报局谴责铁托集团。朝鲜战争开始时，我也不辨谁是谁非，只愤恨美国人的跋扈，见美国人在朝鲜吃了大败仗而感到高兴。因为我是从资产阶级立场看问题，所以不能明辨是非。
    今年二月准备回到祖国时，我心里存在一个矛盾。我想：呆在美国是为美国人服务，回到祖国总是为中国人服务，我应该回去。但是，我有些贪恋美国式的物质生活。最后，我的爱国思想促使我回来。
    回到祖国后，我所见所闻使我思想起了一个巨大的变化。美帝国主义宣传新中国没有自由的谎言，完全被事实所粉碎了。我回到祖国才真正获得了自由。一切工作都出于人民的自觉自愿。我懂得发动群众和命令群众的区别。我看到解放后祖国的伟大成就。我觉得一位超政治的科学工作者，应该立刻觉醒过来，要求改造自己，使自己工作适合于人民的需要。这是我深深感受到的。今年七月间在北京所举行的中国物理学会代表大会上，于光远同志一个报告给我启示很大。我开始认识到，在半封建半殖民地的中国，科学是作为帝国主义科学的一部分存在着的。我们要解放中国科学，首先我们要改造自己。在没有建立全心全意为人民服务的坚定立场时，我如果继续进行在美国所做的那一套研究，我就很可能变成为帝国主义服务的科学的俘虏。
    这次学习运动，给我的教育很大。我对苏联的看法，彻底改变了。回国后，虽然知道苏联对我国建设事业帮助很大，我在感情上还不能和苏联的人民和苏联人民的领袖斯大林结合起来。这是由于我看问题不能从工人阶级立场出发的缘故。最近我学习了斯大林“十月革命的国际性质”，我才认识到，以前因为我的阶级出身，我不能从无产阶级立场看问题，分析问题。今天我渐渐体会到，世界无产阶级的利益是一致的，这条革命大道是苏联无产阶级打出来的，我们和苏联人民的利益是一致的。所以，我现在对苏联不再有什么怀疑。这表现在我对斯大林的著作渐渐喜欢钻研上。我觉得我们应该相信苏联。只有挖掉自己的错误看法的根源，我想这才会进步。
    我感到这次学习运动对我仅仅是一个开头，我决意更加努力不懈地改造自己。
