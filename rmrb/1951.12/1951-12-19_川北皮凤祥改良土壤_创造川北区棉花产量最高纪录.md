    Pi Fengxiang from Northern Sichuan Improves Soil
    Creates Highest Cotton Yield Record in Northern Sichuan Region
    Pi Fengxiang, a 51-year-old farmer from Liushutuo, Shehong County, Northern Sichuan Administrative Region, achieved a bumper cotton harvest this year, yielding 411 jin of seed cotton per mu. This is currently the highest yield per unit area in the Northern Sichuan cotton-producing region. Pi Fengxiang's bumper cotton harvest is the result of his efforts to improve the soil. Last year, He Songting and Liu Yueting, cotton-growing models from Northern Sichuan Region, went to Beijing to attend a meeting and met Chairman Mao. This event encouraged cotton farmers throughout Northern Sichuan, especially Pi Fengxiang, who was determined to achieve a high cotton yield and strive to meet Chairman Mao. His 11.7 mu of land, located by the Liushutuo River, had very poor soil, partly clay and partly sandy, unsuitable for growing cotton. But he came up with a solution: before sowing, he divided the sandy soil into many squares, digging a pit every two feet in all directions. He filled the pits with a layer of clay and a layer of horse manure, and allowed fallen leaves to decompose inside, to increase the soil's cohesiveness. For the clay soil, he transported more than 250 loads of fine sand and spread it on the soil. After plowing and harrowing, the clayiness was reduced. When the Qingming Festival arrived, the best time for sowing cotton, he planted all "Dezi 531" cotton seeds. After that, he diligently irrigated and caught insects. The local people's government also sent cadres to provide him with technical guidance, resulting in a bumper harvest. Now he is determined to sell all his cotton to the state and is actively selecting seeds and accumulating fertilizer, preparing to create even higher yields next year. Liu Mengfei

    川北皮凤祥改良土壤
    创造川北区棉花产量最高纪录
    川北行政区射洪县柳树沱五十一岁的老农民皮凤祥，今年植棉获得丰收，每亩收籽棉四百十一斤，这是目前川北棉产区单位面积产量的最高纪录。皮凤祥的棉花丰收，是由于他努力改良土壤的结果。去年川北区植棉模范贺松亭、刘悦廷到北京开会见到了毛主席，这件事鼓舞了全川北的棉农，特别是皮凤祥，他下决心要使棉花丰产，争取去见毛主席。他的十一亩七分地，在柳树沱河边，土壤很坏，一部分是黏质土壤，一部分是沙地，不宜于种棉。但他想出了解决的办法：在下种前，把沙地划成许多方格，前后左右每隔两尺挖一个坑，坑中填
    一层黏土，一层马粪，并让落叶腐烂在内，以便增加土壤黏性，对于黏质土地，他搬运了二百五十多挑细沙，撒在土里，经过耕耙，就减轻了黏性。到清明时节，是棉花下种的最好时节，他全部种上了“德字五三一”棉种。以后，他便勤于灌水、捉虫。当地人民政府并派干部在技术上给他指导，因此获得丰收。现在他决心把全部棉花卖给国家，并积极选种、积肥，准备明年创造更高的产量。　刘梦飞
