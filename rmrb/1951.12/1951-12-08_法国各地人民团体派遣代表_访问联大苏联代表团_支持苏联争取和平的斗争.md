Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: People's organizations from various parts of France have sent delegations to visit the Soviet delegation attending the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, expressing their desire for peace and support for the Soviet delegation's struggle for peace in the United Nations. According to a TASS report on the 3rd, representatives of peace advocates from Pris Saint-Gervais, a suburb of Paris, visited the Soviet delegation and were warmly received by Yakov Malik, Deputy Head of the Soviet Delegation and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. They handed the Soviet delegation a letter unanimously adopted by the peace advocates of the district to the United Nations, which earnestly called on the governments of all countries participating in the United Nations General Assembly in Paris to "show goodwill and sincerity in order to seek compromises and peaceful settlements to all current disputes." The letter called for countries to reduce armaments and oppose the arming of West Germany. The representatives of Pris Saint-Gervais greatly admired the Soviet Union's struggle in the United Nations for peace and friendship among nations. The representatives also asked Malik to convey to Stalin, the leader of the people of the world, that the French people will work together with the Soviet people to achieve the noble tasks to which the Soviet delegation is dedicated at the United Nations General Assembly. In his reply, Malik expressed his gratitude for the delegation's visit and pointed out that the support of the French people encouraged the Soviet delegation's will to strive for peace. The Soviet delegation believes that peace will surely prevail over war.

    【新华社五日讯】法国各地人民纷纷派遣代表团访问出席联合国第六届大会的苏联代表团，表达他们爱好和平的意志，并表示支持苏联代表团在联合国所进行的争取和平的斗争。据塔斯社三日电报道，巴黎郊区普里圣日维和平拥护者的代表们拜访了苏联代表团，受到苏联代表团副团长、苏联外交部副部长马立克的热诚招待。他们交给苏联代表团一封该区和平拥护者一致通过的给联合国的信，其中热切地呼吁参加巴黎联合国大会的各国政府“表现善意和诚意，以设法就目前的一切争执取得妥协与和平解决的协议”。这封信要求各国裁减军备并反对武装西德。普里圣日维的代表们对于苏联在联合国中为争取和平及各国间的友好而进行的斗争极为敬佩。代表们并要求马立克转告全世界人民的领袖斯大林：法国人民将和苏联人民共同努力，以求实现苏联代表团在联合国大会上所致力的崇高任务。马立克在答复中对代表们的来意表示感谢，并且指出法国人民的支持鼓舞了苏联代表团争取和平的意志。苏联代表团认为和平一定会战胜战争。
    巴黎近郊文孙纳的和平拥护者的代表们，工人居住区奥伯维耶的妇女代表们，雷诺汽车工厂的工人代表们和其他若干地区人民所派遣的代表团，也都先后访问了苏联代表团，并作同样的表示。这些法国人民的代表团也到过美、英等国的代表团的那里去，但是都没有被接见。
    苏联代表团还收到从法国各地寄来的越来越多的信件，其中都以极大的热忱表达了法国人民的和平愿望。它们表示对维护和平的伟大苏联的信任，并保证加强反对战争贩子的斗争。
