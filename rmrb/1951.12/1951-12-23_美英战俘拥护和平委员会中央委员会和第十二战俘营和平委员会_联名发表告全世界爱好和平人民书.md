Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd December. The Central Committee of the American and British Prisoners of War Adhering to Peace Committee and the Peace Committee of the 12th POW Camp in Korea, jointly issued a letter to the world's peace-loving people on the 20th. The full text is as follows:

    To all peace-loving people in the world:

    We, the undersigned, are members of the Central Committee of the American and British Prisoners of War Adhering to Peace Committee and the Peace Committee of the 12th POW Camp, and we hope to express to you in this letter the sincere wishes of all United Nations prisoners of war in Korea.

    We want to go home. For many of us, this is our second Christmas as prisoners of war in Korea. Although the Chinese People's Volunteers treat us extremely well, feed us well, and take care of us very kindly, we miss our hometowns very much. We want to go home.

    Our reasons for wanting to go home are very simple. We want to see our wives, children, and our parents. We yearn to live a peaceful life again. We hate mass slaughter, and we do not want to see American planes indiscriminately bombing the Korean people, causing many innocent children to lose their lives unnecessarily every day, like the frantic bombing of Pyongyang by more than 100 B-29 planes that we witnessed in Pyongyang this August. We are also afraid to hear that our comrades are losing their lives on the front lines. We know that every day that peace is delayed, many lives will be wasted in vain.

    Therefore, we have all been hoping that the armistice negotiations currently underway will be successfully concluded. Especially now that the two delegations are discussing the exchange of prisoners of war, we are even more concerned about the negotiations.

    However, we know that the United Nations side has used delaying tactics in the past. For more than five months, we have been closely monitoring the progress of the peace talks. We have seen how the United Nations side has used all sorts of methods to obstruct peace, in order to achieve certain results in other areas, such as the passage of huge military appropriations in the United States and the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan. In our view, it seems that whenever peace is about to be achieved, the United Nations delegation resorts to new tricks to prevent peace from being realized. Peace always seems to be within our reach, but we can never grasp it.

    An example of this delaying tactic is the recent statement by Colonel Hanley of the U.S. Eighth Army, who insisted that the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army had wantonly massacred United Nations prisoners of war in Korea. The purpose of this statement is very clear. This is to create an excuse to further delay the peace talks. Its purpose is to arouse public anger in order to incite war hysteria in the United States and other countries. It hopes to boost the morale of the troops on the front lines, who, like us, want to go home but are being asked to continue fighting to avenge us. It intends to deceive our relatives and friends by spreading the news that we are all dead anyway, and to create public opinion in favor of continuing the war.

    Therefore, several prisoners of war below have spoken of their personal experiences to refute this statement:

    American and British Prisoners of War Adhering to Peace Committee Central Committee Member, U.S. Army 25th Division 24th Infantry Regiment "C" Company Warrant Officer John Porter said:

    We were surrounded on all sides by the Chinese People's Volunteers, less than a hundred yards apart. We could hear them shouting in broken English, "Don't shoot, we are your friends."

    We knew we were surrounded and saw heavy casualties, so we decided to surrender. After we surrendered, the Chinese People's Volunteers were very kind to us, only took our weapons, and never even searched us, nor took away any of our clothes or personal belongings.

    Since being captured, I have heard many prisoners of war say almost in unison how the Chinese People's Volunteers tried to avoid killing them as much as possible after surrounding them in battle, and shouted the same words to them: "Don't shoot, we are your friends." The Chinese People's Volunteers do not speak English, but they have all learned to say these few words. The fact that so many prisoners of war have heard this shouting in the moment before being captured proves that the policy of the Chinese People's Volunteers is to try to save our lives. Can anyone with a conscience call such a fact "killing prisoners of war"? I can't say it.

    American and British Prisoners of War Adhering to Peace Committee Central Committee Member, British Army 29th Brigade Royal Ulster Rifles 1st Battalion Infantry Edward Spencer said:

    After being captured on the morning of January 4, 1951, a group of us marched to the rear POW camp.

    One day when we were resting, I fell ill, and I knew that walking would make me very painful. The Chinese People's Volunteers (who captured us) quickly learned of my situation, they were very concerned and asked me: "Are you sure you can walk tonight?" I was still very scared at the time, afraid that once I left the group, something unexpected would happen. I had heard that I would be killed, someone had told me that the best way for the Chinese People's Volunteers to deal with people who became a burden to them was to shoot them. So I quickly replied: "Ah! Yes, yes! I am perfectly able to walk." But some people said they could not walk, so they stayed behind. I was still thinking on the road how stupid they were and thought I would never see them again.

    After arriving at the POW camp, there were many good things waiting for us. One thing I liked the most was the daily distribution of pork. I have always liked pork. But under the UK's poor rationing system, it was impossible to get pork every week, let alone once a day. Another good thing in the POW camp was the various newspapers, and I learned from a newspaper that the soldiers who said they could not walk and were left behind on the road had been sent back to their own lines and were now at home with their loved ones. I will always remember the question: Are you sure you can walk tonight?

    Can anyone with a real conscience call this release of prisoners of war, as Hanley's statement does, "an obvious propaganda trick played to create a favorable atmosphere for future capture of the enemy"? I can't do that.

    American and British Prisoners of War Adhering to Peace Committee Central Committee Secretary, U.S. Army 2nd Division 503rd Field Artillery Battalion Corporal Lloyd Cartel said:

    Once I was sent to another POW camp. I felt very relieved because I and many other prisoners lived in a small village, far from any major roads and with no military targets.

    Therefore, I felt very safe and would not be attacked by American planes again, and I was really grateful to the Korean People's Army for always taking care of our personal safety.

    Later, something happened: that day the weather was clear, and a U.S. Navy plane flew over and bombed the POW camp for no reason. But within seconds of the bombs exploding, while the plane was still buzzing overhead, two nurses from the Korean People's Army were already treating the wounded in the bombed area.

    Indeed, we could be massacred at any time, killed not by those who captured us, but by our own planes. Think about it! How could he see any military targets to bomb in the air? I was on the ground, but I didn't see any military targets.

    Later I went back to the original barracks. As soon as I arrived, I heard familiar voices welcoming me, but what I saw were not familiar faces. An old friend of mine, Chest Jennings, looked fat and had a potbelly when he welcomed me, saying: "Lloyd, don't stare, I've only gained thirty pounds since I was captured." Can anyone with a conscience still say this is "inhumane treatment"? I can't!

    American and British Prisoners of War Adhering to Peace Committee Central Committee Vice Chairman, British Army 29th Brigade 8th Hussars Soldier Ronald Cokes said:

    We are about to leave this camp, which we have regarded as our home for more than six months.

    Six months! In these six months, the Korean People's Army who captured us—I should call them friends—and we prisoners have become very close. We have suffered together from barbaric aerial bombardments, which destroyed many villages and gardens in our neighborhood, including the houses in the village where our camp was located. During the harvest season, we all voluntarily helped the villagers with the harvest. In the summer, we jointly overcame the terrible floods caused by the flooding of nearby rivers. In the summer, we all received single-layer clothes, and in the winter, we received warm cotton uniforms. We all ate the same food and smoked the same cigarettes.

    The personnel of the Korean People's Army have held concerts for us, and they have also participated in singing and drama evenings held in our spacious club. Now we have to say goodbye, and although it seems unbelievable, I know that most of us Americans and British are very moved because we may or may never see our Korean friends again. We came to this POW camp in the past as captured enemy soldiers. Today, we leave as close friends and comrades, with pleasant memories that will never be forgotten.

    Our two Korean nurses rushed to the car to say goodbye to us, and most of the small number of guards who had been with us also came with the two nurses, giving cigarettes to everyone and shaking hands to say goodbye. I felt heartfelt pain when I shook hands with them. I want to ask the same question again: Can anyone with a conscience say that this kind of treatment we have received is "communist atrocities"? I know I can't say that!

    Thus, you have heard the personal accounts of the humane treatment given by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to us United Nations prisoners of war in Korea.

    Another tactic used by the United Nations side to delay the armistice negotiations is the issue of exchanging prisoners of war. We know that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegations have repeatedly insisted that when a ceasefire is implemented, all prisoners of war detained by both sides must be exchanged, but when the United Nations side is asked what they think of this proposal, they always avoid answering. We know that this proposal is indeed fair and conforms to the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War signed by the U.S. government and all recognized practices, which is that when hostilities cease, all prisoners of war must be sent back to their homelands. But the United Nations side has always disagreed with this proposal, which is extremely important to us.

    We see those people using these tactics one after another, indefinitely delaying the realization of peace and prolonging the war, so that those who make a fortune from the war can continue to make a fortune; we don't need to be surprised when we see this situation.

    Therefore, we ask all peace-loving people in the world to work hard to promote the successful conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations. We ask them to work hard to win peace, not just to let those who want to prolong the war conduct peace talks. For all prisoners of war in Korea, for our parents, wives, and children, we ask all peace-loving people to force our governments not to use us as bargaining chips, to realize peace in Korea, and to release us immediately.

    美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会和第十二战俘营和平委员会
    联名发表告全世界爱好和平人民书
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】在朝鲜的美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会和第十二战俘营和平委员会，在二十日联名发表告全世界爱好和平人民书，全文如下：
    全世界爱好和平的人们：
    我们这些在下面签名的人，是美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会和第十二战俘营和平委员会的委员，我们希望在这封信里向你们表达出在朝鲜的全体联合国军战俘的衷心愿望。
    我们希望回家。对我们当中许多人来说，这是我们在朝鲜当战俘以后的第二个圣诞节。虽然中国人民志愿军待我们好极了，让我们吃得很好，并且非常和善地照顾我们，但是我们非常想念我们的家乡。我们希望回家。
    我们希望回家的理由简单得很。我们希望看我们的妻子、儿女和我们的父母。我们渴望再过和平的生活。我们讨厌大规模的屠杀，我们不愿看到美国飞机毫无区别地滥炸朝鲜人民，使许多无辜的小孩子天天不必要地丧失性命，像我们今年八月在平壤亲眼看到的一百多架B—二十九式飞机疯狂轰炸平壤那样。我们也怕听说我们的伙伴在前线上丢掉性命，我们知道，和平每迟来一天，就会白白浪费掉许多人的性命。
    因此我们大家一直希望此刻正在进行的停战谈判能够胜利结束。尤其是现在双方代表团正在讨论交换战俘问题的时候，我们对谈判更加关心。
    但是我们知道联合国军方面在过去曾使用拖延时间的手段。五个多月以来，我们一直在密切注意和平谈判的进展情况。我们看到联合国军方面是怎样使用各种各样的手段来阻挠和平，借以在其他方面取得一定的结果，如在美国通过巨额军事拨款，和签订单独对日和约等。在我们看来，似乎每当和平快要实现时，联合国军代表团就耍弄一些新手段，使和平不能实现。和平似乎总是在我们手边上，而我们总是抓不到它。
    这种拖延战术的一个实例就是：美国第八军汉莱上校最近发表声明，硬说中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军曾肆意虐杀在朝鲜的联合国军战俘。这个声明的目的是很清楚的。这是给进一步拖延和平谈判制造藉口。它的目的是激起人民的愤怒以便在美国和其他国家煽动战争歇斯底里。它指望提高前线军队的士气，他们和我们一样都是想要回国的，但是却被要求继续作战来给我们报仇。它打算散布我们反正全都死了的消息来欺骗我们的亲友，并制造一种有利于继续战争的舆论。
    因此，下面有几名战俘说出了他们的亲身经验来驳斥这个声明：
    美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会委员、美军第二十五师第二十四步兵团“C”连准尉约翰·波特尔说：
    我们被中国人民志愿军四面包围了，彼此相距不到一百码。我们能听见他们用不流利的英语高声喊叫：“不要开枪，我们是你们的朋友。”
    我们知道自己被包围了，并且看到伤亡很大就决定投降。在我们投降以后，中国人民志愿军对我们非常和气，只拿走了我们的武器，甚至从来不曾搜查过我们，也没有拿走我们的任何衣服或个人的任何东西。
    自从被俘以后，我听见许多战俘差不多都异口同声地说，中国人民志愿军在战斗中把他们包围起来以后，怎样尽可能避免杀死他们，并且对他们喊同样的话：“不要开枪，我们是你们的朋友。”中国人民志愿军是不会说英文的，但是他们每个人都学会了说这几句话。有这样多的战俘在被俘的前一刻听见过这种喊话，证明中国人民志愿军的政策是设法救我们的命。难道任何有良心的人能够把这样的事实说成“杀害战俘”吗？我是说不出口的。
    美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会委员、英军第二十九旅皇家阿尔斯特步兵团第一营步兵爱德华·斯潘塞说：
    在一九五一年一月四日清晨被俘后，我们一批人就步行到后方战俘营去。
    有一天我们休息的时候，我生了病，我知道步行会使得我十分痛苦。中国人民志愿军（俘掳我们的人）很快就知道了我的情况，他们非常关心并问我：“你有把握今天晚上能走路吗？”我当时仍是非常害怕，害怕一旦我和大队离开了，就会有不测的事情发生。我曾经听到说我会被杀死的，有人曾经告诉我：中国人民志愿军认为对付成为他们累赘的人的最好办法，就是把他枪毙。所以我很快地回答说：“啊！是的，是的！我完全能够走。”但是有一些人说他们不能够走，于是他们就留在后面。我在路上仍然在想他们是多么愚蠢并以为我决不能再看见他们了。
    到了战俘营后，那里有许多好事在等待着我们。有一件事使我最喜欢的是每天发给猪肉。我一向是喜欢猪肉的。但是按照英国可怜的配给制，每周要得到猪肉都不可能，更谈不到每天一次了。俘虏营中另一件好事是有各种报纸，我就是从一份报纸上得知：那些在路上说他们不能走并被留在后面的大兵们已被送回到他们自己的防线，现在已在家里和他们的亲爱的人儿在一道了。我会永远记得这个问题：你有把握今天晚上能走路吗？
    凡是一个真有良心的人能像汉莱声明那样把这种释放战俘叫做“为了制造将来俘掳敌人的有利气氛而玩弄的明显宣传手段”吗？我是不能这样做的。
    美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会秘书、美军第二师第五百零三野战炮兵营劳埃·卡特尔下士说：
    有一次我被送到另外一个战俘营去。我觉得非常放心，因为我和许多其他的俘虏居住在一个小村庄里，离开任何重要公路都很远，也没有什么军事目标。
    因此，我觉得非常安全，不会再受美国飞机的攻击了，我也实在感激朝鲜人民军，因为他们总是在照顾我们的个人安全。
    后来事情发生了：那天天气晴朗，一架美国海军的飞机无缘无故飞来轰炸俘虏营。但是在炸弹爆炸后几秒钟，飞机还在上空嗡嗡作响的时候，两位朝鲜人民军的护士就已经在受炸地区给受伤的人治疗了。
    的确，我们随时都可能被屠杀，杀我们的不是俘掳我们的人，而是我们自己的飞机。你们想一想吧！他在空中怎么能看到什么可以轰炸的军事目标呢？我就在地面上，但都看不到什么军事目标。
    后来我又回到原来那个营房去。我一到就听到欢迎我的都是熟悉的声音，看到的却不是熟悉的面孔。我的一位老朋友却士特·詹宁斯在欢迎我的时候显得面孔胖胖的，挺起了个肚子说：“劳埃，你不要看得发呆，我比被俘前只增加了三十磅。”凡是有良心的人还能够说这是“非人道的待遇”吗？我不能！
    美英战俘拥护和平委员会中央委员会副主席、英军第二十九旅第八骠骑兵队士兵罗纳尔德·柯克斯说：
    我们就要离开这个营房了，我们在这六个多月一直把这个营房看作我们的家一样。
    六个月了！在这六个月中，俘掳我们的朝鲜人民军——我应该把他们叫做朋友——和我们俘虏之间已经非常亲密。我们曾经一同遭受过野蛮的空中轰炸，这些轰炸毁坏了我们邻近地方的许多村庄和田园，其中也有我们营房所在的村庄的房屋。在收割庄稼期间，我们大家曾自动帮助村民进行收割。夏天的时候，我们曾共同克服了附近的河流泛滥所引起的可怕水灾。夏天我们都领到单衣，冬天则领到温暖的棉制服，我们都吃同样的饭，吸同样的烟。
    朝鲜人民军的人员曾为我们举办音乐会，他们也参加我们在我们的宽敞的俱乐部里举行的歌唱与戏剧晚会。现在我们不得不告别了，虽然看起来好像难以置信，但是我知道我们这些美国人和英国人大多数都很感动，因为我们也许或永远再也不能看到我们的朝鲜朋友了。我们过去作为被俘的敌军士兵来到这个战俘营。今天又作为密友和同志，怀着永不会遗忘的愉快的记忆离去。
    我们的两位朝鲜护士赶到车子旁边来向我们告别，曾和我们在一起的人数不多的警卫队，其中的大多数也都和两位护士一起来了，他们向每一个人送香烟，握手送别。我和他们握手时衷心感到了痛苦。我要再提出同一个问题：凡是有良心的人能够说我们所受到的这种待遇是“共产党的暴行”吗？我知道我不能这样说！
    这样，你们就听到了亲身经历者的叙述，说明了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军给予我们在朝鲜的联合国军战俘的人道待遇。
    联合国军方面用来拖延停战谈判的又一个策略，是关于交换战俘的问题。我们知道，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团一再坚持：实行停火的时候，必须交换双方拘留的全部战俘，但是联合国军方面被问起对这个建议有何意见时，总是避免答复。我们知道，这个建议的确是公平的，并且符合美国政府所签订的日内瓦战俘公约和一切公认的惯例，这就是：在敌对行动停止的时候，全部战俘必须被送回他们的故乡。但是联合国军方面一直不同意这个对我们极端重要的建议。
    我们看到那些人们接连不断使用这种策略，无限期地拖延和平的实现，延长战争，好让那些从战争中大发其财的人们能继续发财；我们看到这种情况，用不着感到奇怪。
    因此，我们要求全世界一切爱好和平的人民努力促使朝鲜停战谈判获得圆满的结束，我们要求他们努力赢得和平，不要光是让那些想要延长战争的人们进行和平谈判。为了在朝鲜的全体战俘，为了我们的父母、妻子、儿女，我们要求一切爱好和平的人民迫使我们的政府不要把我们当作讨价还价的东西，要实现朝鲜的和平，使我们立即获释。
