The advanced working experience of the Li Xikui shunting team is currently being widely studied and applied by shunting workers at major railway stations across the country. Since the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government instructed all railway administrations to vigorously promote the Li Xikui shunting method in August this year, shunting personnel at major stations nationwide, such as Shenyang, Harbin, Sujiatun, Mudanjiang, Suifenhe, Manzhouli, Siping, Changchun, Qiqihar, Sankeshu, Jilin, Meihekou, Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, Tianjin, Fengtai, Zhangjiakou, Bengbu, Xuzhou, Chang'an, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hengyang, Wuchang, and sixty other stations, have successively undergone processes of organized study, focused trial implementation, and gradual promotion, universally learning and applying the advanced working methods of the Li Xikui shunting team.

Before learning the Li Xikui shunting method, stations in various regions had generally tried or implemented new shunting methods; shunting work had been significantly improved across the board; the dwell time and turnaround time of vehicles at stations had been shortened universally. After further implementing the Li Xikui shunting method, various bureaus further improved shunting work, further shortening the dwell time and turnaround time of vehicles at stations. Guangzhou Station implemented a new shunting method in June, and in July, the dwell time and turnaround time of vehicles at the station were shortened by 30% compared to June. In October, after the station promoted the Li Xikui shunting method in September, the dwell time of vehicles at the station was shortened by another 18% compared to July, and the turnaround time was shortened by another 4%. Xuzhou Station implemented a new shunting method in July, and in July, the dwell time of vehicles at the station was shortened by 12% compared to June, and the turnaround time was shortened by 3%. In September, this station promoted the Li Xikui shunting method, and the dwell time of vehicles at the station was shortened by another 15% compared to July. In July, the results of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method at other stations were also significant, not only consolidating and enriching the original work foundation for implementing new shunting methods but also once again improving shunting efficiency and shortening vehicle dwell time and turnaround time.

Railway workers in various regions truly demonstrated their wisdom in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method, creating some new methods suitable for specific situations. For example, the Wang Xianzhe shunting team at Harbin Station and the Su Tiangeng shunting team at Sujiatun Station achieved good results and specific experience in using the "disassembly considering marshalling" and other working methods in the Li Xikui shunting method. Because of the station line equipment conditions at Zhangjiakou and other stations, the shunting yard is close to the station, and the shunting yard is reached immediately after leaving the station office. The shunting workers at this station inspect the shunting yard once before taking over the shift to understand the vehicle conditions on the lines, achieving "line responsibility system," "area responsibility" and "restricted vehicle responsibility"; at the same time, they also hold a brief meeting after taking over the shift to replace the "walkway meeting system." Bengbu and other stations also faced difficulties with insufficient lines due to the smaller number of lines within the station due to the line equipment conditions; after research, the workers flexibly applied the method of "flexible use of classification lines" to solve the difficulty of insufficient lines. These methods created by railway workers in various regions during the implementation of the Li Xikui shunting method have made the Li Xikui shunting method more complete and comprehensive.

The work of the China Changchun Railway Administration in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method is the best in the country. After organizing a Li Xikui Advanced Working Method Training Class in June this year, the China Changchun Railway Administration began to organize and promote it widely within its jurisdiction in a led and planned manner. The Harbin, Sujiatun, Suifenhe, and other stations under the jurisdiction of the China Changchun Railway Administration have been more serious in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method, implemented it more thoroughly, and made more significant progress in shunting work. Other regions, such as Zhengzhou Station, Shijiazhuang Station, and Shanghai Maigen Road Station, have not been timely enough in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method. Due to insufficient attention from the leadership, Zhengzhou Station and Shijiazhuang Station only began to implement the new shunting method in October and promoted the Li Xikui shunting method in November based on the new shunting method. Shanghai Maigen Road Station is one of the main stations of the Shanghai Railway Administration, but because some leading cadres believed that there was not enough line equipment, they delayed the trial implementation of the Li Xikui shunting method until November.

Judging from the promotion situation in various places, some cadres still have conservative ideas or adopt a resistant attitude, hindering the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method. For example, some cadres at Shanghai Maigen Road Station and Tianjin Station have some erroneous ideas, such as "the line equipment at each station is different, and it cannot be implemented," "it is not suitable for the specific situation of our station," etc. Some cadres at Qiqihar, Fengtai, Zhangjiakou, and other stations also have complacency: "We also have our own set of methods." "We have all had these methods." "It's similar to ours, nothing new." These erroneous ideas are not only held by some cadres at the stations mentioned above but also by some cadres at other stations. Some of these erroneous ideas have been gradually corrected and eliminated through the patient education of leading cadres and the influence of advanced shunting workers' practice; but some have not been completely corrected to this day. Leaders at all levels should pay attention to this situation and give due criticism and correction.

In order to better promote the Li Xikui shunting method in depth throughout the country, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government began on November 21st to hold a one-month Station Technical Operations and Li Xikui Shunting Method Training Class in Harbin, to which all railway administrations and major stations across the country have dispatched staff related to shunting work to participate in the study. This training class focuses on explaining the Li Xikui shunting method. This will be of great help in vigorously spreading the advanced experience of the Li Xikui shunting team. (Wu Feng)

    全国已有六十六个车站推广李锡奎调车法
    有些车站的干部仍然不重视这个先进的调车方法
    领导方面应注意克服错误的保守思想和自满情绪
    李锡奎调车组的先进工作经验，目前正被全国铁路各主要车站的调车工作人员，广泛地学习和运用。自从今年八月间中央人民政府铁道部指示各铁路管理局大力推广李锡奎调车法以来，全国各主要车站，如沈阳、哈尔滨、苏家屯、牡丹江、绥芬河、满洲里、四平、长春、齐齐哈尔、三棵树、吉林、梅河口、锦州、山海关、天津、丰台、张家口、蚌埠、徐州、长安、杭州、南京、广州、衡阳、武昌等六十六个站的调车人员，都先后经过组织学习、重点试行和逐步推广等过程，普遍地学习和运用了李锡奎调车组的先进工作方法。
    各地车站在学习李锡奎调车法以前，一般地都已经试行或实行了新调车法；调车工作普遍地显著地提高了；车辆在车站的停留时间和中转时间普遍地缩短了。各局经过进一步实行李锡奎调车法后，又把调车工作提高了一步，更缩短了车辆在车站的停留时间和中转时间。广州站在六月间实行新调车法，七月份车辆在车站的停留时间和中转时间，比六月份各缩短了百分之三十。九月份，这个站推广李锡奎调车法后，十月份车辆在车站的停留时间，比七月份又缩短了百分之十八，中转时间又缩短了百分之四。徐州站七月份实行新调车法，七月份车辆在车站的停留时间，比六月份缩短了百分之十二，中转时间缩短了百分之三。九月份，这个站推广了李锡奎调车法，车辆在车站停留时间比七月份又缩短了百分之十五。七月间，其他各站推广李锡奎调车法的结果，也有很大的成绩，不但巩固和充实了原来实行新调车法的工作基础，而且再一次地提高了调车工作效率，缩短了车辆停留时间和中转时间。
    各地铁路职工在推广李锡奎调车法时，真正发挥了自己的智慧，创造了一些适合具体情况的新方法。如哈尔滨站王宪祉调车组、苏家屯站苏天更调车组等，在运用李锡奎调车法中的“解体照顾编成” 等工作方法时，有了良好的效果和具体的经验。张家口等站因车站线路设备关系，调车场离车站近，一出车站办公室，就到了调车场，该站调车职工在接班前，先巡视一次调车场，了解线路上的车辆情况，做到“包线制”、“包地带”和“包限制车”； 同时并在接班后开碰头会，以代替“走道会议制”。蚌埠等站也因为线路设备关系，站内线路较少；职工们经过研究，灵活地运用了“活用分类线”的方法，解决了线路不足的困难。各地铁路职工在实行李锡奎调车法过程中所创造的这些方法，使李锡奎调车法更加充实和完整。
    中长铁路管理局推广李锡奎调车法的工作，是全国最好的。中长铁路管理局在今年六月组织了李锡奎先进工作方法训练班以后，就开始有领导有计划地在本局管内广泛地组织推广。中长铁路管理局管内的哈尔滨、苏家屯、绥芬河等站，推广李锡奎调车法比较认真，执行得比较彻底，调车工作进步也比较显著。其他地区，如郑州站、石家庄站以及上海麦根路站对于推广李锡奎调车法却做得不够及时。由于领导方面抓得不够紧，郑州站和石家庄站在十月份才开始实行新调车法，十一月份才在新调车法的基础上推广李锡奎调车法。上海麦根路站是上海铁路管理局的主要站之一，因为部分领导干部认为线路设备不够用，所以一直延迟到十一月才开始试行李锡奎调车法。
    从各地推广的情形来看，一部分干部还有保守思想，或者采取抵抗态度，阻碍了李锡奎调车法的推广。如上海麦根路站、天津站等站的部分干部，就有些错误的想法，像“各站线路设备不同，无法实行”，“不适合我们车站具体情况”等。齐齐哈尔、丰台、张家口等站的部分干部也有自满情绪：“我们自己也有一套。”“这些办法我们都有过。”“和我们的大同小异，没什么新奇。”这些错误的想法，不仅上面说到的这些车站的部分干部有，其他车站的某些干部中也有。这些错误的想法，有的由于领导干部耐心的教育，和先进调车工友实践的影响，逐步地被纠正和消除；但有的直到如今还没有彻底纠正。各级领导干部对这样的情况应加以注意，并给以应有的批评和纠正。
    为了更好地在全国范围内深入推广李锡奎调车法，中央人民政府铁道部已于十一月二十一日起，在哈尔滨开办了为期一个月的车站技术作业和李锡奎调车法训练班，由全国各铁路管理局各主要车站抽派和调车工作有关的工作人员参加学习。这个训练班着重地讲解李锡奎调车法。这对于大力传播李锡奎调车组先进经验将有很大的帮助。（吴风）
