    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st: The Third All-Soviet Peace Congress victoriously concluded on November 29th. Before its closing, the congress continued to discuss the report by Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee. The congress adopted a letter to all participants in peace movements of all countries and a congratulatory letter to Stalin.

    At the morning session, Ershova, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, presided. Alexander Koshcheev, Chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, said: Soviet youth wholeheartedly support Stalin's peace policy and, together with the people of the whole country, defend this policy. Koshcheev pointed out that Soviet youth are actively working to strengthen international youth cooperation and are calling on the youth of all countries to fight resolutely for the peace and happiness of all peoples.

    The famous Ukrainian writer Korneychuk pointed out that the slanderous propaganda of American newspapers and radio has recently intensified, but the determination of peace fighters will never be weakened by any threats or conspiracies of war instigators. Korneychuk also warmly saluted all peace supporters around the world from the congress podium and called on them to bravely advance for the cause of world peace.

    The famous Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich spoke at the meeting about the cultural ties between the Soviet people and the people of all countries, saying: These ties must be expanded and strengthened. We should organize international conferences to celebrate the anniversaries of great figures of the past and make the best works of world art more widely available.

    Suni, Honored Art Worker of the Karelo-Finnish Republic, vehemently denounced American imperialism for piecing together various military blocs and building military bases in foreign territories in Northern Europe near the Soviet border. Suni emphasized that the Soviet people are not afraid of any threats because we are strong and our strength is growing stronger every day. Hiyaletdinov, representing the Muslim Ahongs and Muslims of the European part of the Soviet Union, Central Asia, Kazakhstan, and Siberia, called on Muslim leaders and Muslims around the world, especially those in Turkey, Iran, Syria, and other Muslim countries, to fight against the conspiracies of American and British imperialists to drag them into a new world war and to participate in the peace movement led by the World Peace Council. Kotov, Executive Secretary of the Soviet Peace Committee, reported on behalf of the Credentials Committee that among the 1,137 representatives of all nationalities attending this congress, there were 220 worker representatives, 225 collective farm peasant representatives, and a broad representation of intellectuals. In addition, many religious figures attended the meeting. Among the representatives were 31 Heroes of the Soviet Union, 112 Heroes of Socialist Labor, and 147 Stalin Prize laureates. The composition of the congress fully demonstrated the unity of the entire Soviet people in the struggle to maintain and strengthen peace.

    The evening session was presided over by Tikhonov. Letters and telegrams of congratulations to the congress were read out, including those from the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, and the Peace Committees of Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Argentina, and other countries.

    Then, Panning, a fishing ground manager, spoke on behalf of the working people of the Soviet Far East. He protested against the American-made "peace treaty" with Japan and pointed out the war-like nature of this "treaty."

    Also speaking at the meeting were: Alexander Gerasimov, President of the Soviet Academy of Arts; the famous composer Novikov; Georgia teacher Gamkrelidze; Azerbaijani geologist Aliyev; Ural steelworker Zhelrogin; and Kakabaev, Chairman of the Turkmen "Bolshevik" collective farm. The discussion on Tikhonov's report was thus concluded. More than 70 people spoke in the three-day meeting, showing the Soviet people's desire to live in friendship with the people of all countries and their firm determination and strength to defend peace.

    The congress then unanimously adopted a letter to all participants in peace movements of all countries, which stated: "We, the representatives of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, extend our warm greetings to the participants in the great movement to defend peace in all countries outside our homeland. The Soviet people fight unyieldingly for peace because they believe that aggressive war is the most serious crime against humanity and the greatest disaster for ordinary people all over the world. The Soviet people wholeheartedly approve and unanimously support the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet government. The Soviet people vigilantly watch the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and stand ready at any time to defend their homeland, defend peaceful labor, and strike hard at all enemies who dare to infringe upon their freedom and independence with selfless courage and heroism. We warmly endorse and support in every way the program for further struggle for peace announced by the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council. We declare that we will continue to fight against the conspiracies of war instigators and for a consolidated and lasting peace throughout the world."

    Finally, the congress passed a congratulatory letter to Stalin, the great standard-bearer for the defense of world peace, with soaring enthusiasm. The whole audience cheered: "Long live the Soviet Union, the standard-bearer of peace and friendship!" Stormy applause and cheers resounded for a long time.
