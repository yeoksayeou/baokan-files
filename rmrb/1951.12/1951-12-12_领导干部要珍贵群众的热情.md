    Leading Cadres Should Cherish the Enthusiasm of the Masses

    The erroneous attitude of the leading cadres of the Shanghai Public-Operated Xinhua Cotton Mill in coldly treating the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, which dampened the enthusiasm of the masses, highlights an important lesson. That is, to promote any advanced work method, leading cadres must give timely and strong leadership and support, and should never be detached from the masses, standing outside of them.

    The Xinhua Cotton Mill had extremely favorable conditions for promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method: workers had a high enthusiasm for learning, and the "little teachers" were active and diligent. However, there were also some objective limitations: the democratic unity work had not yet been completed, and some machine equipment needed to be modified, etc. In this situation, leading cadres should cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, rely on the initiative of the masses, overcome the limitations of objective conditions, and support the promotion of the new work method. However, the leading cadres of the Xinhua Cotton Mill, in the struggle between activists and those with backward and conservative ideas, adopted an attitude of indifference and standing by. This dampened the enthusiasm of the masses. If the enthusiasm of the masses cools down, it will take great effort to re-ignite it. The central task of the Xinhua Cotton Mill at that time was democratic unity. However, the attitude of the leading cadres of the Xinhua Cotton Mill towards the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was not in line with the spirit of "democratic unity." Democratic unity was originally intended to solve certain problems within the workers, strengthen the unity of the staff, in order to improve production. Therefore, it is necessary to support the progressive and correct aspects, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and overcome the conservative and backward ideas of some workers. Only in this way can we consolidate unity, which will also be more conducive to production. Treating democratic unity work and the promotion of advanced experience as two completely separate things is wrong. Leading cadres should not fail to provide support when the masses urgently demand the promotion of advanced experience simply because the democratic unity movement has not yet ended. Waiting until the central task is completed before promoting advanced experience anew will, in fact, be counterproductive, which must be taken into account.

    领导干部要珍贵群众的热情
    上海公营新华纱厂领导干部冷淡地对待郝建秀工作法的错误态度，打击了群众的热情。这件事实突出地说明了一个重要的教训，这就是，推广任何一种先进工作法，领导干部必须及时地给以有力的领导和支持，决不应该脱离群众，站在群众之外。
    新华纱厂具有推广郝建秀工作法的极为有利的条件：工人学习情绪很高，“小先生”积极努力。但也有一些客观限制：民主团结工作尚未结束，若干机器设备需要改装，等等。在这种情况下，领导干部应该十分珍贵群众的热情，依靠群众的积极性，克服客观条件的限制，支持新工作法的推广。但是，新华纱厂的领导干部，在积极分子和有落后保守思想的人们进行斗争中，却采取了事不关己、冷眼旁观的态度。这就使群众的热情遭受打击。群众的热情如果冷下去，要想重新发动起来，就要费很大的力量。新华纱厂当时的中心工作，是民主团结。但是，新华纱厂的领导干部对待郝建秀工作法推广工作的态度，和“民主团结”的精神是不相符合的。民主团结原是要解决工人内部的若干问题，加强职工的团结，以利于改进生产。因此，必须支持进步的正确的方面，开展批评和自我批评，克服部分工人的保守落后思想。只有这样，才能巩固团结，对生产也更加有利。把民主团结工作和推广先进经验当作截然分开的两件事是不对的。领导干部不能因为民主团结运动还没有结束，在群众急切要求推广先进经验时不予以支持。等到中心工作告一段落，再从新推广先进经验时，事实上将会事倍而功半，这是必须估计到的。
