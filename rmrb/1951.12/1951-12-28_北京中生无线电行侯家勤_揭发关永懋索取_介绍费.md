    Beijing Zhong Sheng Radio Shop's Hou Jiaqin
    Exposes Guan Yongmao for Soliciting "Referral Fees"
    To the Editor: I'm writing to tell you about a case of procurement personnel soliciting "referral fees." On December 25, 1950, Guan Yongmao of the Outer Line Section of the Beijing Branch of the North China Electric Power Administration (located on Shuncheng Street) inquired by telephone about the price of a "100-watt amplifier" from our shop, and repeatedly tried to "drive down the price" (i.e., bargain). On December 28th of the same month, Guan Yongmao introduced and accompanied Comrade Wang Dejun from the Tianshui Local Work Committee of the Communist Youth League to our shop to inspect the goods, requested a price quotation, and agreed on the same day that the price of the goods (including modification, adjustment, and additional accessories) would be 18.3 million yuan. A deposit of 13 million yuan was paid in advance, and delivery was to be made on January 19, 1951. The day after delivery, Guan Yongmao came alone to solicit a 10% "referral fee." After repeated explanations from our shop, Guan still insisted on taking 900,000 yuan before leaving. We believe that Guan Yongmao's behavior is wrong. At a time when the anti-corruption movement is being launched, we are writing this specifically for the reference of responsible comrades in relevant departments.

    北京中生无线电行侯家勤
    揭发关永懋索取“介绍费”
    编辑同志：告诉你们一件有关采购人员索取“介绍费”的事。一九五○年十二月二十五日，华北电业管理局北京分公司（在顺城街）外线股关永懋，用电话询问本行一种“一百瓦扩音机”的价格，并且一再“砸价”（即讨价还价）。同月二十八日，关永懋介绍并陪同青年团天水地方工作委员会王德军同志来本行看货，要估价单，并且当天讲妥，货价（包括改装、调整和添配附件）一千八百三十万元，先付订款一千三百万元，一九五一年一月十九日交货。交货后一日，关永懋独来索取一成“介绍费”，经本行再三解说，结果关还是要走九十万元才算了事。我们认为，关永懋这种行为是错误的。当目前开展反贪污运动的时候，特别把它写出来，供有关部门的负责同志参考。
