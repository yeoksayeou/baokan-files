    讨论继续推行民族区域自治等重要问题
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次会议已在十二月十四日开幕。这次会议主要的任务是总结两年来各地民族工作的主要经验，讨论继续推行民族区域自治等重要问题，并起草有关的法案，提供中央人民政府审核采择。这次会议扩大举行，出席这次会议的有中央民族事务委员会委员、各地民族代表、县级以上自治区人民政府和专区级民族民主联合政府负责人，以及各大行政区、省、市民族事务委员会和有关部门负责人等共一百三十多人。
    会场四周悬挂着用各民族文字书写的标语。主席台正中高悬各民族人民的领袖毛主席的画像。大会在热烈的掌声中开始，首由中央人民政府民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉致开会词。他首先指出：出席这次会议的除了中央民族事务委员会的委员以外，还有四十多名少数民族代表和各地担任民族事务工作的负责人。这就使这次会议同时具有着全国民族代表会议的性质。李维汉说：两年来，我们伟大的祖国——中华各民族平等友爱和合作互助的大家庭，在毛主席、中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，无论在政治、经济、文化和军事方面，包括少数民族地区的各种工作在内，都获得了辉煌的成就，我们国内各民族更表现了空前的团结。这次会议就是在国内各民族空前大团结的基础上召开的。他在指出这次会议的任务之后着重地说：希望大家齐心协力完成这次会议的任务，同时本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，对中央民族事务委员会的工作提出批评和改进的意见。

    政务院文化教育委员会副主任马叙伦在讲话中叙述了两年来少数民族地区文化教育工作的成绩和经验，并指出今后少数民族地区的教育工作应以培养少数民族干部为首要任务，同时，要用更大的力量开展少数民族地区的卫生工作。
