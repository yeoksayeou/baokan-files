    Shang Qingming of the North China Regional Company of China National Oil Corporation
    Severely Punished for Embezzlement, Bribery, and Theft of Secrets

    Shang Qingming, a secretary in the business department of the North China Regional Company of China National Oil Corporation, abused his authority for personal gain, causing significant losses to state property. The Tianjin People's Court has sentenced Shang to fifteen years in prison and confiscated his existing embezzled funds and the house he bought with the embezzled funds.

    Shang Qingming was a retained employee. He used his position to collude with brokers Zhang Enrui, Yang Fulu, and others for personal gain. In November 1949, he colluded with Dong Sheng (an imperialist spy, who has been detained by the People's Government) to defraud the Fulai Shipping Company of Tianjin of over 10 million yuan in commissions. In 1950, he again colluded with Dong Sheng and the Xinhua Trading Company to illegally engage in export trade, and received bribes from Dong Sheng seven times, totaling more than 21 million yuan. Shang not only embezzled and took bribes but also frequently stole business secrets of the North China Regional Company of China National Oil Corporation, colluding with private merchants for personal gain. In January 1950, Shang colluded with private merchants to set up a so-called "Mountain Products Department Factory" in Tianjin, which was identical to the Oil Corporation in terms of business. He told the personnel of the "Mountain Products Department Factory" the secrets of the Oil Corporation every day to do illegal business, reaping huge profits of 800 million yuan in six months. Shang shared more than 70 million yuan in illegal profits.

    Before liberation, Shang Qingming had long served as a comprador in foreign firms. After the collapse of the German fascist regime in World War II, he assisted Dong Sheng in hiding a large number of materials. After liberation, Shang Qingming still did not repent. I feel that the leading cadres of the North China Regional Company of China National Oil Corporation were not vigilant against bad elements, causing great losses to state property, which is a serious form of bureaucracy and should be deeply examined.

    中国油脂公司华北区公司尚庆铭
    贪污受贿盗窃机密受到严惩
    中国油脂公司华北区公司业务部秘书尚庆铭，利用职权营私舞弊，使国家财产受到很大损失。天津市人民法院已判处尚犯徒刑十五年，并没收尚犯的现存赃款和他用赃款所买的房屋。
    尚庆铭是留用人员。他曾利用职权勾结经纪人张恩瑞、杨福禄等营私舞弊。他在一九四九年十一月间，勾结董盛（帝国主义间谍分子，已被人民政府扣押）共同诈骗天津福来船行佣金一千多万元。他在一九五○年又和董盛勾结新华贸易行违法经营出口商业，先后受过董盛七次贿赂，共计二千一百多万元。尚犯不只贪污受贿，而且还经常盗窃中国油脂公司华北区公司业务机密，勾结私商营私舞弊。尚犯在一九五○年一月，勾结私商在天津设立了业务上和油脂公司相同的所谓“山货部工厂”，每天把油脂公司机密，告诉“山货部工厂”人员，做违法生意，六个月获暴利八亿元。尚犯在不法利润中分得七千多万元。
    尚庆铭在解放前曾长期在外商洋行充当买办。第二次世界大战德国法西斯政权垮台以后，协助董盛藏匿大批物资。解放后，尚庆铭仍不知悔改。我觉得中国油脂公司华北区公司领导干部，对坏分子失掉警惕，使国家财产遭受了很大损失，是一种严重的官僚主义，应该深刻检讨。高检
