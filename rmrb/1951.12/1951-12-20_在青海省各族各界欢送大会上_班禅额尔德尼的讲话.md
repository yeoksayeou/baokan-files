    Panchen Erdeni's Speech at the Send-off Meeting of All Ethnic Groups and Circles in Qinghai Province
    Vice Chairman Xi, leading comrades of the Party, government, and military of Qinghai Province, and distinguished guests:

    As we are about to leave Qinghai and return to Tibet, we are deeply grateful for the warm send-off from all leading comrades and distinguished guests. In particular, we are extremely grateful to Vice Chairman Xi, who, despite his busy schedule, represents the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, as well as the Northwest Military and Political Committee, for traveling a long distance to bid us farewell. First, we would like to express our gratitude to the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and the leading comrades and distinguished guests of Qinghai Province.

    Secondly, I would like to share some thoughts. We have been away from Tibet for nearly thirty years. Without the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the enthusiastic assistance of all fraternal ethnic groups in China, the peaceful liberation of Tibet would have been impossible, and our return to Tibet would also have been impossible. Therefore, we say that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the great saviors of the Tibetan people and our great benefactors. We must follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we must unite closely with all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland. Only in this way can our Tibetan ethnic group achieve complete liberation. There is no other way.

    I would especially like to mention that since the liberation of Qinghai, we have received the care and respect of the Party, government, military, and people of all circles in Qinghai. We have received much assistance in political, economic, and daily life aspects, which makes us feel infinitely warm. This is something we have never experienced and could never have enjoyed before. Only in the big family of the People's Republic of China can this be possible. In addition to expressing our deep gratitude to the leading comrades and distinguished guests in person, I also assure you that after we return to Tibet, we will resolutely obey the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, unite closely with the Dalai Lama, and respond to the love and help of the leading comrades and distinguished guests with practical actions to thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Finally, I wish you all good health.

    在青海省各族各界欢送大会上
    班禅额尔德尼的讲话习副主席、青海省党政军各位首长、各位先生：
    在我们即将离青海返回西藏之际，承蒙各位首长、各位先生对我们热烈欢送，尤其是习副主席在百忙当中代表中央人民政府和毛主席及西北军政委员会，不远千里前来为我们送行，使我们万分感激。我们先向中央人民政府、毛主席和西北军政委员会、青海省的各位首长、各位先生致谢。
    其次，我要说一点感想。我们流离内地快近三十年了，如果没有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，与中国各兄弟民族的热诚帮助，西藏的和平解放是根本不可能的，我们重返西藏亦是不可能的。因此，我们说中国共产党和毛主席是西藏人民的大救星，是我们的大恩人。我们只有跟着共产党和毛主席走，只有同祖国各兄弟民族紧密地团结起来，我们西藏民族才能得到彻底的解放，别的道路是没有的。
    我要特别提出：青海解放以来，我们受到了青海党政军及各界人民的关怀和尊重，在政治上、经济上以及日常生活方面，我们都得到很多的帮助，使我们感到无限的温暖。这是我们从来没有与不可能享受到的，只有在中华人民共和国大家庭中才能如此。我除当面向各位首长、各位先生致以深切的感谢外，并向各位保证：我们返藏之后，一定坚决服从毛主席和共产党的领导，与达赖喇嘛亲密团结，以彻底实现和平解放西藏办法的协议的实际行动来回答各位首长、各位先生对我们的热爱与帮助。最后敬祝诸位身体健康。
