Many representatives of various countries have spoken here, each with their own arguments. However, if someone tries to determine the general direction of these speeches and attempts to categorize them (so to speak), I believe it is completely correct and fully in line with the actual situation. We must remember: the representatives of Canada, Belgium, the Nationalists, Costa Rica, Yugoslavia, Brazil, etc. — and I must also include my neighbor, the British representative — are all members of the North Atlantic Aggression Group, or they are countries that follow in the footsteps of this group. This determines their attitude towards certain issues.

Therefore, it is not surprising that they are all competing here to spread slander and falsehoods, defaming the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and hating them fiercely. It would be strange if they were to say anything else.

They all rely completely on their masters. To a large extent, they rely on the money of their masters to barely survive. If they were to suddenly decide not to fulfill their duties — the tasks and responsibilities to their masters — that would indeed be strange.

This not only applies to the representatives I have already mentioned, but also to all those who have spoken here hypocritically, such as the representative of Brazil. I must say: such speeches are ignorant and deliberately distort the truth.

The reason for such malicious words is very clear. The issue currently under discussion is very important. The issue is that the Soviet Union stands as a major and insurmountable obstacle on the road to a new world war. I should say that this obstructs the path of your North Atlantic Aggression Group, which wants to push humanity into the abyss of this war — this is precisely the main reason these people attack the Soviet Union.

We are accusing the United States, and at the same time, we are loudly calling for opposition to war. We will consistently maintain this attitude and persist in it. This is not a joke, gentlemen. The October 10th Law and our protest against this law are not Christmas toys, as the overly jocular Canadian representative and some other overly jocular young people have somewhat presumptuously said.

The U.S. representative and his lackeys defend the "October 10th Law," distorting the truth.

The October 10th Law is another step forward on the road to a new world war. However, we hear that this law is supposedly never to be implemented, that it will never be used to achieve these "crazy purposes," as Mr. Mansfield said yesterday here. Hearing these words makes one feel both amused and puzzled — even those who say these words do not believe them.

You know, laws are not made to be left unimplemented, not to be used as a basis for actual actions. Laws are made to guide actual actions, to achieve certain expected actual effects from the implementation of this law. Therefore, the argument that laws are not equal to actions, as Mr. Gross of the United States said in the General Committee, is completely untenable. No, laws are actions. Every law, from the moment it is approved, from the moment it is implemented, takes effect. However, there are cases where the actions prescribed by a certain law already exist, and the law is approved later. The October 10th Law and the Kerschensteiner Amendment are precisely such cases. The situation is precisely this, because even before this law was promulgated, even before Congress gave it legal form with its October 1951 decision, such actions had already taken place.

Today, I will once again try to explain the meaning of this law in a simple way. However, I must declare in advance that I consider it completely unnecessary and futile to argue with these gentlemen one by one, to debate with them. They are here to curry favor with the United States, not to oppose or criticize our attitude, but to rudely defame our country. I do not intend to debate with them — whether it is the representative of Belgium or the delegation of Costa Rica, or the old lackey of the United States, the Nationalists, or the representative of the Tito group, or some other delegation. Some of them, like the representatives of the Nationalists and the Tito group, are here using all their strength to defame Soviet policy; others are speaking here today according to the instructions given to them in advance by the United States, repeating what their masters told them, and unfortunately, such delegations are not in the minority. I want to talk about the masters. For the sake of not repeating myself later, I plan to say a few words about Mr. Lloyd's speech first. If we do not talk about the cow that he mentioned again and that bothered him, if we do not talk about this unfortunate cow, what else did Mr. Lloyd say? I listened carefully to his speech. He waved some documents in his hand, pretending to quote something to prove how the October 10th Law should be correctly understood, but he did not prove anything.

He mentioned Report No. 703, claiming that this report must have given a true and correct interpretation of the October 10th Law and the Kerschensteiner Amendment. He even read a few sentences, but these are still from the October 10th Law Amendment, and they are not at all what he calls "an interpretation of the law." This is inevitable, because apart from the documents I read here, Mr. Lloyd has no other documents to interpret the October 10th Law. I am honored to have read many documents here in the First Committee, reading them page by page, line by line, pointing out the dates of these speeches, and pointing out the page numbers in the official records. However, these documents, whether it is Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Mansfield, or anyone else in their group, are considered not worth mentioning.

Indeed, I have quoted here the testimony of such authorities as Mr. Kerschensteiner himself, who proposed this bill, and Mr. Volker, Mr. Mansfield's colleague (he is also a member of the U.S. delegation and the proposer of this amendment, and in any case, he is one of the congressmen who support this amendment), and the explanations given by Congressmen Armstrong, Curry, Richards, Morano, former Assistant Secretary of State Ball, and the well-known State Department advisor Dulles. Has anyone here refuted the evidence I presented? Has Mr. Mansfield or anyone else made any corrections to all the documents we have quoted here during this period? They have not refuted our words, but they naively say: because there is no so-called evidence, nothing can be proven! They dare to pretend to be so noble and say: if you accuse a country, you must present evidence. We have done so, the evidence has been presented. Someone might say that the evidence we presented is not satisfactory, lacks persuasive power. However, in this case, those who say such things must prove why this evidence is not satisfactory and lacks persuasive power. But what have they said? They say: what is quoted here are the speeches of some congressmen, but Congress is composed of 531 male and female congressmen, the opinions of individual congressmen are not the opinions of Congress. But I ask: did Congress agree with these opinions? You, as congressmen, agree with these opinions, Volker agrees with these opinions, Kerschensteiner agrees with these opinions, Kerschensteiner's amendment was passed by Congress; Kerschensteiner taught Austin that it is impossible to carry out this "liberation" movement, as you call it, without terror.

After explaining all these circumstances, I ask you: is it Congress or individual congressmen? Is Congress not composed of those who decide issues and express opinions on the decisions they have already made? We are talking about these opinions. The main principle of interpreting laws is to determine the opinion of the legislative body itself on the law. However, the opinion of the legislative body is reflected by the legislators of the legislative body, and the opinion of the legislative body is formed by the opinions of these legislators. If you can present any other opinions apart from the opinions I have quoted here, then you have the right to say: this is truly the opinion of Congress, not the opinion of Kerschensteiner, not the opinion of Morano, not the opinion of Armstrong, not the opinion of Mansfield, not the opinion of Volker, not the opinion of some Sabrowski, etc. You have not done so, because you cannot do so, you cannot do so because you have no material to do so — I say: there is absolutely no such material!

Therefore, I must remind the entire committee: Mr. Mansfield said here that the Soviet Union should present convincing evidence to prove that its accusations against the United States are based on facts; but the Soviet Union has not presented such evidence. Some of the representatives who support him also parrot the same words. Their statements are completely groundless. The evidence has been presented. As Mr. Lloyd said today, this evidence has been studied here. This evidence has not been refuted at all, and you have not made any corrections to the explanations given by the people you value, so it is inevitable and indisputable that these explanations and our evidence are truly convincing evidence, our evidence is what lawyers call irrefutable evidence, that is, first-hand, most reliable evidence.

Of course, you all remember what this evidence consists of. I would like to ask the members of the Political Committee to take this matter seriously; do not rush to end the discussion on this matter, so that this matter does not get a thorough investigation and extensive study. I would like to ask them to study the minutes of the meetings that everyone can see, the minutes of the meetings of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on July 19, July 25, October 10, and October 20 this year; these minutes contain the sufficiently clear explanations given by all U.S. congressmen, which I have mentioned as they are — no one doubts this, and there can be no doubt; no one has made any corrections or even refuted them.

Gentlemen, these are facts. Of course, you can make the tame majority vote for what you incite to pass. However, you have no right to say that we have not proven this matter. I know that some of you will vote against this matter, because when discussing the substance of this matter, you do not say a word, and now you still do not say a word, and in the future, you will not say a word.

I am prepared to request an extension of our discussion to allow this evidence to be thoroughly investigated. Let everyone discuss it.

You will not do so because you dare not do so. You cannot do so because you have no evidence to counter our arguments and evidence.

To end the discussion on this matter, I think it is necessary to summarize what we have proven based entirely on the explanations given by U.S. congressmen in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. What did they say? What did they admit?

First, they admitted that the amendment to the October 10th Law is combined with this law, so the entire purpose of the October 10th Law is to recruit individuals or entire groups from the so-called "refugees" who have escaped from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, provide them with economic assistance, organize them into armies, and form armed groups like individuals that can be used to execute the plans of the Atlantic Pact. What plans? You say they are "defense" plans. We believe these plans are not defense plans but aggression plans. However, let us not consider the nature of these plans for now; in any case, these are the plans of the Atlantic Pact.

First, here are the proofs given by these congressmen. Can you deny it? You cannot, and you do not deny this matter.

Second, they admitted that organizing such armies and recruiting those specially selected individuals who have escaped from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and those living within the territories of these countries to participate in such military measures, the purpose, as Dulles said, is to establish powerful attacking forces, station these forces in key positions around the Soviet Union, and use them as tools to destroy the solid governments, countries, and social systems established by the peoples of these countries based on their free will.

Third, they admitted that these armies and individuals recruited to carry out hostile activities against the above-mentioned countries are to be organized on the territories of the United States and other Atlantic Pact countries, or on the territories of the above-mentioned countries. As for the funds for organizing such forces, it is the one billion dollars allocated for this purpose.

Fourth, they admitted that after these armies are formed, they will become national armies with their own national flags and emblems and will be commanded by their own national officers.

Fifth, they admitted that these armies will join the Atlantic Pact forces as national military units. In other words, they may join the so-called European Army.

Sixth, they admitted that in addition to organizing them into armies to achieve the various purposes I mentioned above, they will also use individual groups or individuals selected from war criminals, traitors, and other so-called exiles to threaten the peoples of the above-mentioned countries (according to congressmen, it is for intimidation), and use them to carry out terrorist activities. This, according to the author of the amendment, Kerschensteiner, must occupy a very important position in the plan to implement the so-called "liberation" movement of Eastern European countries.

These are the various things that many gentlemen have talked about inside and outside the House of Representatives Committee regarding the October 10th Law. According to the official documents published by the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, we can clearly obtain at least six conclusions, which we have pointed out above.

No one (even the official representative of the United States) wants to say a word to correct — or, to put it mildly, to refute — anything we have said, and this is not accidental. This is very clear because refuting others requires sufficient materials and facts. Refuting others means having documents in hand, reading and interpreting what is written in these documents. I would very much like Mr. Mansfield and his friends to try doing this. Then it can be seen what all this means, what words like "terror," "uprising," "destructive blow to the Iron Curtain," "destructive blow to the Kremlin regime," etc., mean. But they avoid doing this. They only talk in vain, which is not the serious attitude a serious person should have towards this matter; and they also persistently deny. The only sentence they keep repeating is: "There is no proof, no evidence has been presented." This is said in response to the large amount of evidence we have presented. But what other evidence do you want? There is indeed more evidence, but Congressman Volker refused to say it in the open meeting of the committee. This is understandable. In certain circumstances, this evidence has leaked out, no matter what the congressmen say, I will talk about this later. Facts are facts. The true purpose of the October 10th Law has been fully exposed. The draft of the code against crimes against peace and human security was removed from the agenda of the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and from this shameful whole affair, the true purpose of this law can be seen.

This draft code was removed from the agenda because Kerschensteiner and other honorable congressmen were afraid that if this code was not removed, it would definitely be passed, and the second article of this code stipulates that it is illegal for one country to carry out terrorist and subversive activities against another country. This article frightened Kerschensteiner and his ilk because they thought that if this article was passed by the General Assembly, it would hinder the passage of the October 10th Law and the Kerschensteiner amendment to this law, and would definitely make it more difficult to pass. About this, I have already talked in detail yesterday, and today I only want to recall it.

Does this matter still not clearly and convincingly explain the meaning of the October 10th Law and the Kerschensteiner amendment, and explain for what purposes and to achieve such suspicious and shameful goals? If they, like us, act according to the requirements of conscience and self-respect, thoroughly analyze all these documents, and prove to us that the actual situation is different from what we have said to the committee, I would understand. But no one among the supporters of the United States has done this, no one has ever wanted to deny anything or prove anything.

These poor, vulgar lawyers have avoided this issue and have not even requested a postponement of the meeting, although postponing the meeting might be more appropriate. But now they themselves insist that the Soviet Union has not presented any evidence or facts. However, before they said this, all the evidence and facts I quoted had already been presented, and Mr. Mansfield and the accomplices from Brazil, Canada, and other countries who helped him in this shameful affair have absolutely not presented any arguments to defend their own positions.

Do you think that after all this, it is still possible to simply deny the truth and erase the truly convincing facts with a wave of the hand? You can vote with your hands, but you cannot do so with your brains. We are not afraid of such a vote because, as our country's proverb says: the truth is like an awl, a bag cannot hide it. The truth is mightier than words, and for those who value the truth, know how to defend the truth, and want to help the truth triumph over falsehood, the truth will always reach their ears. We will never be intimidated by such a vote.

All the above, the explanations given by the drafters of the October 10th Law Amendment and their assistants, have made the true meaning of this amendment, which Mr. Mansfield repeatedly cites here, very clear, but Mr. Mansfield still hypocritically says: this amendment really does not contain anything evil or harmful to others.

According to Mr. Mansfield, this amendment stipulates that up to one billion dollars should be allocated from the funds to be allocated to organize those selected from among the refugees who have escaped from behind the Iron Curtain into a force supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Since the Joint Committee has accepted this provision, it wants to show: those who may be enlisted in such a force must definitely be volunteers.

This is what Mr. Mansfield said on the 19th of this month. On the 20th, he explained: indeed, the intention of Congress is to allocate the one billion dollars allocated according to the Kerschensteiner amendment to the October 10th Law to the president to manage, so that those who have escaped from Europe or are about to escape can participate in the so-called defense of the North Atlantic Society.

But what is the actual purpose of allocating this one billion dollars? It is to organize armies. With whom to organize? With refugees. What kind of refugees? Those who have escaped from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, or those who may escape from these countries in the future. This is the purpose to be achieved by spending this money according to the president's order.

It is worth noting: Mr. Mansfield has now abandoned his previous talk about the one billion dollar law being for charitable purposes, which he previously said was allocated to help those who are suffering and begging for this dollar aid. Kerschensteiner once brazenly said that, according to his understanding, this one billion dollars is to be used to assist those who want to join the armed forces of the Atlantic Pact. It seems that this is not aid for those poor and helpless refugees who need material assistance, not aid for the poor. The aid is not for these people. First, according to Kerschensteiner, those who are suitable for military service should be aided; second, according to Mr. Mansfield, they are not helping these people to make a living, but buying them to join the armed forces of the Atlantic Pact. These are the mercenaries of the modern era.

In such a case, can anyone still be deceived by talk of "defense," the "liberation" purposes of the Atlantic Pact, etc.?

Mr. Mansfield, with his so-called "reversing black and white," calls war peace, calls aggression defense, calls plans to suppress and oppress the people liberation movements...

The falsity of these words has already been exposed here.

At a meeting, the Egyptian representative gave a good response to the American and British representatives who droned on about the peaceful "defense" purposes of American and British policies. He said that so far, this policy has been manifested in the achievements of British bulldozers, which have leveled the homes of Egyptian citizens to the ground, and have repeatedly leveled entire villages to the ground.

To cover up the extremely shameful and glaring subversive and terrorist nature of this whole affair, Mr. Mansfield yesterday, as a member of the U.S. delegation representing the executive power of the U.S. government, said: this law will definitely not be used by the executive power to pursue the arrogant purposes that the Soviet delegation mentioned at the meeting of this committee.

But this law has no other purpose than what our delegation has said; and if we consider that the activities to achieve these purposes must fail, then these purposes can indeed be called arrogant. However, although the conspiracy plotted by the United States and some other countries' aggression groups against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is indeed absurd and crazy, it is still a plan being implemented.

The words of the U.S. representative are not without political tricks. Because he later said that the issue of using these armies, which we know are for subversive and hostile activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, remains to be decided by the North Atlantic Treaty countries through common consultation, and if such a force is formed, this force will also be used to counter aggression.

Here we encounter the trick of playing with words again: what aggression, defense, etc.

This is obviously an attempt to shift the responsibility to the other member countries of the Atlantic Pact, for which the United States has promised to consult with them on this issue in the future, although the more regular procedure and order seem to be the opposite — if a person respects his allies a little, he should first consult with his allies and then make laws that impose certain obligations on these allies. However, this is ultimately the internal affair of the member countries of the Atlantic Pact, and it has little to do with us.

This fully exposes the attempt to portray the Soviet Union's proposal to the General Assembly that the United States should abide by the order and abolish the October 10th Law as slandering the United States and undermining the alleged defensive measures of some members of the Atlantic Pact, which has completely failed. The fact is: the October 10th Law and the Kerschensteiner amendment unprecedentedly violate the basic principles and standards of international law. Undoubtedly, this is what Austin considered when he wrote to Kerschensteiner, saying that the current world situation requires something different from the old international law. Therefore, international law is outdated, it cannot adapt to U.S. policy, it hinders U.S. activities, and it greatly hinders the activities of the entire Atlantic Pact. This proves that the old international law that Austin talked about hinders the current so-called new policy of U.S. diplomacy. This law must be amended. New methods must be found to improve this law and implement this law.

Austin tried to convince Kerschensteiner in his letter that: any code that can be called a United Nations code must recognize such an important fact today. That is: it must recognize that the internationally recognized standards and principles of international law are no longer suitable for the United States, and they should be replaced by new international law standards. These are the "important facts" that Austin talked about. What kind of new standards are these? These standards can be described in two words: "cloak and dagger"! Using the words about "defense" as a cloak to cover the dagger of aggression!

Now we see the "new" word that Austin wrote in his letter appears in the Kerschensteiner amendment, which abolishes the internationally recognized basic principles of international law, discards these principles, and replaces them with these special "new principles." These new principles do not pave the way for laws that must serve peace, which international law must serve, but pave the way for lawless behavior that creates division and discord; not pave the way for peace, which international law must serve, but pave the way for war, which is still hindered by this law! This is not accidental. The Kerschensteiner amendment to the October 10th Law is another step forward on the road of aggression, on the road chosen by the Atlantic Pact camp. In this camp, the United States has always played a leading role and has implemented a consistent diplomatic policy.

The U.S. representative repeatedly insists that the Atlantic Pact — which he calls the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the North Atlantic Society — is not for aggression but completely for the defense purposes he mentioned. However, this is an old problem that many people have long solved. But if we look at this problem in reference to the October 10th Law and the Kerschensteiner amendment, we can assert: this law alone, this amendment alone (the meaning of this law and this amendment has been fully determined by the accurate and error-free explanations given by the drafters of this law and this amendment themselves) is the best and perhaps irrefutable evidence that precisely proves the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty. Even if the Atlantic Pact has nothing else but this law, which approves the allocation of one billion dollars to carry out the subversive activities that the Atlantic Pact is currently carrying out in other countries and plans to continue, this alone is enough to prove the true aggressive nature of this group!

Please note, a country that maintains normal diplomatic relations with another country openly announces in peacetime the formation of a military group on its own territory and recruits citizens of other countries living within its borders to fight against their homeland, their country, is unprecedented. However, the U.S. government not only organizes many citizens of other countries living within its borders into such military groups but also sets a goal for itself — it openly announces this goal in its law — to establish similar groups and recruit individual citizens of these countries to fight against the legal governments of these countries. This is unprecedented!

Naturally, because such a policy has been adopted, it is also necessary to make corresponding amendments to international law — to amend its principles, its standards, and the recognized principles and standards of international law. It has been proven that this is necessary because the measures stipulated by the October 10th Law and the Kerschensteiner amendment are incompatible with the recognized principles and standards of international law.

Title: The United States Government's Unprecedented Measures
Author:

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 23rd.

Mr. Mansfield must have found some justification for the unprecedented measures taken by the American government. He said: During the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union did not refuse to provide weapons to foreign nationals who requested them, and many of these foreigners had fought alongside the Red Army in the previous war, just as many people in countries occupied by the invaders fought alongside the Western Allies. However, this is a false and strained analogy, because even Mr. Mansfield should know that the current situation is completely different from the past and is entirely a different matter. The former is a country under attack by invaders accepting foreign assistance to resist the attack, which is one thing; the latter is, in peacetime, a country that has neither been attacked nor threatened with attack, hiring and buying citizens of other countries to form armed forces, training them, and preparing to send them to attack their own people, their own country, which is another thing.

It should also be pointed out that it is only possible for foreigners to provide such assistance to a country under attack when war has already broken out, which is completely different from what the United States is doing now. Now is a time of peace, especially when the United States still maintains normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. However, within the United States, there are people recruiting so-called wartime refugees who were expelled from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries during the war, organizing armies, and preparing to use them in the future anti-Soviet struggle in the United States.

We have normal diplomatic relations between us, but at the same time, Soviet citizens within the United States are being organized into armies to fight against the Soviet Union.

When they do this, they say: "Yes, we are organizing such armies, training them, and drilling them—this is just 'aid' to poor refugees."

Since when has such "aid" been allowed? Has anyone ever heard of such a thing?

In peacetime, the American government allocates large sums of money to organize and equip spies, saboteurs, terrorists, and entire armies for this purpose, recruiting so-called refugees—actually traitors and turncoats. Of course, among these people, some are deceived, some are starving to death, and they no longer think about their honor; they only think about how to get at least moldy bread crusts—however, if you recruit these people, if you make these people join your army, if you dress them in your country's military uniforms, train them, pay them, and prepare to use them in future armed attacks against us, then we have the right to say: you have committed an unprecedented heinous crime against international law, against the principles of international law, against the normal diplomatic relations between these countries, and against peace. We have the right to say this! We have said this!

In peacetime, the American government is training these people militarily and using airplanes to drop them into the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries to carry out criminal activities against the current governments of these countries and their state and social systems. You are doing all this, and it has been proven.

We say: Mansfield's strained and absurd explanation here is absurd; especially since the Soviet Union has never organized armed groups and armies within its territory to fight against any country with which it maintains diplomatic relations, this is even more absurd.

Mr. Mansfield asked us: If some foreign communists who wish to settle in the Soviet Union express that they will defend it when the Soviet Union is attacked, would the Soviet government not allow them to join its armed forces?

However, here Mr. Mansfield shows either ignorance of the issue or recklessness, a bit of "changing his tune." He is just playing tricks, hoping to at least make both sides seem the same.

The issue is completely different. The United States can allow those who wish to settle in the United States and defend it when it is attacked by another country to settle there and seek refuge, the problem is not here.

The problem is completely different.

The problem is: (1) The United States encourages a large number of so-called refugees from other countries to flee to the United States, these refugees are suitable for military service, willing to be hired, willing to join special armies, and falsely claim to be the national armies of the countries they fled from. (2) Under the cover of false words about defense, they are used to achieve the purpose of aggression. Not only are they used to achieve these purposes, but according to the Kruschen Modification, there are other purposes—according to the drafter of the modification, Kruschen himself, there is also the purpose of carrying out terrorist activities to carry out terrorist activities in the territories of the countries they originally fled from. (3) With this purpose in mind, Americans systematically drop these people with parachutes into the territories of these countries, and they carry out criminal activities according to the instructions of the leaders of American intelligence and military agencies.

The United States uses the right of asylum to support terrorists, violating the 1933 US-Soviet agreement

As for the question Mr. Mansfield asked, whether the Soviet government allows those who express their willingness to defend the Soviet Union to reside in its territory, if he could look at this question with a good conscience, he could find a detailed answer in the conversation between the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Stalin, and the chairman of the Scripps-Howard newspaper system in the United States, Howard, in 1936. This conversation is directly related to the question raised here and is of great significance, so I think it is necessary to quote the entire conversation between Howard and the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Stalin.

Howard: "When diplomatic relations were established between the Soviet Union and the United States, President Roosevelt and Mr. Litvinov exchanged identical documents on the issue of propaganda. In the fourth clause of the letter from Mr. Litvinov to President Roosevelt, it is stated that the Soviet government has the following obligations: 'Not to allow the existence or organization of any group or organization within its territory aimed at overthrowing or preparing to overthrow, or changing the political and social system of the whole of the United States or any part of its territory or territory, and to take measures within its territory to stop the activities of such groups or organizations and their representatives or responsible persons.' I ask you, Mr. Stalin, to explain how, if the performance of this obligation is not in accordance with the wishes of the Soviet Union or not within the power of the Soviet Union, Mr. Litvinov signed this letter?"

Stalin: "The performance of the obligation you quoted is within our power, and we have performed this obligation and will continue to perform it. According to our constitution, political refugees have the right to reside in the Soviet Union, and we give them the right of asylum, just as the United States gives political refugees the right of asylum. It is clear that Litvinov signed the letter on the basis that this obligation is to be performed by both sides. You, Mr. Howard, now in the United States, there are White Russian refugees who receive material assistance from American citizens to carry out anti-Soviet propaganda for capitalist interests, and sometimes they become terrorist organizations, is this not in contradiction with the Roosevelt-Litvinov agreement? Obviously, these refugees are enjoying the right of asylum that exists in the United States as well. As for us, we have never tolerated the existence of any assassins within our territory, regardless of whom their criminal acts are directed against. The interpretation of the right of asylum in the United States is probably broader than in our country. Well, we do not demand this of others. Perhaps you disagree with me, thinking that we sympathize with these political refugees residing in our territory. But do American citizens not sympathize with White Russian political refugees who propagate capitalism and are against the Soviet Union? Then, what is the problem here? The problem is that they should not be helped, they should not be assisted economically in their activities; the problem is that the officials of the two countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Our officials have faithfully performed this obligation. If there are any officials among us who violate this obligation, please inform us.

If one demands that all White Russian refugees be expelled from the United States, this would violate the right of asylum declared in both the United States and the Soviet Union. Here, it must be acknowledged that there is a certain reasonable limit when both sides make demands. Litvinov signed the letter not as an individual but as a representative of his country. Roosevelt's signature was the same. Their agreement is an agreement between two countries. Whether it was Litvinov, the representative of the Soviet Union, or Roosevelt, the representative of the United States, when they signed this agreement, they were representing their respective countries. These two countries should not and will not interfere in each other's internal affairs. This agreement cannot contradict the right of asylum declared by the two countries. The Roosevelt-Litvinov agreement should be interpreted within this scope, the agreement between the representatives of the two countries."

This is the answer to the question raised here. This was proposed as early as 1936 by the leader of our country, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. This answer clearly separates the issue of the right of asylum from the issue being discussed now.

You can shelter whoever you like, just as we have the right to let whoever we want to seek refuge in our country. This is not the issue. We do not violate the right of asylum clearly stipulated in our constitution; we are saying: you, your government, your government officials have no right to assist the White Guards and those who aim to overthrow the Soviet socialist system and the Soviet government. This is not because they may achieve this goal, but because it is an immoral goal prohibited by the 1933 agreement. Your spies are violating the 1933 agreement, and we demand that you be more sincere and moral than them.

From what I have read, it can be seen that: first, the issue of violating the 1933 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union due to the enactment of the October 10th Law must not be confused with the issue of the right of asylum; second, the right of asylum must not be confused with the issue of granting this right to terrorists; third, the Soviet government cannot and will never tolerate the existence of a terrorist within its territory, regardless of whom his criminal conspiracy is directed against; fourth, the issue of propaganda for capitalism and against the Soviet Union or propaganda for socialism and against capitalism must not be confused with the issue of the officials of the two countries signing the 1933 agreement not interfering in the internal affairs and internal life of other countries. What is most important to us now is: not to assist political refugees in their activities, not to help them through official institutions of the United States and those who sympathize with the refugees of the White Guards; fifth and finally, the 1933 agreement stipulates that the activities of spies from the United States and the Soviet Union should not and should not interfere in the internal affairs of the other party, and the United States should not assist all White Guard terrorists and saboteurs and other elements, and should not recruit so-called "wartime refugees" for this purpose with the help of official or unofficial institutions in the United States.

The American representative and his supporters blatantly ignore the facts and distort the attitude of the Soviet Union

Mr. Mansfield obviously does not want to understand this. Those who support him, those who support this shameful thing that the United States is very interested in, obviously do not want to understand this, and they blatantly ignore the facts.

Here, among those who spoke in support of the United States, some, first and foremost Mr. Mansfield himself, yesterday and today, did not hesitate to distort various facts, no matter what, to justify their hypocritical attitude.

For example, Mansfield said that in 1917, all the envoys of the Allied and neutral countries stationed in Petrograd received a circular, which allegedly stated: "The Soviet government considers it not only necessary to maintain diplomatic relations with the governments of various countries but also necessary to maintain diplomatic relations with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which aims to overthrow the current government." However, if one carefully examines the words quoted by Mansfield, one can immediately see that it is all nonsense. The young leaders of the Soviet Republic would be so naive as to say in a circular to the governments of various countries: we think it is appropriate to maintain diplomatic relations with you, with the ruling governments, and at the same time maintain diplomatic relations with revolutionary parties that are striving to overthrow you! This is simply inconceivable, completely nonsense!

In fact, there was no such circular in the world. This is completely fabricated, because in the only circular issued on November 8 (21), 1917, about the establishment of the new government—the Council of People's Commissars—there was only the full text of the democratic peace proposal for a ceasefire on the basis of national self-determination without annexation or indemnity. The Soviet government stated in this circular that it considered this declaration to be a formal proposal for an immediate ceasefire on all fronts and the beginning of peace negotiations, and pointed out that the government had simultaneously put forward this proposal to the peoples and governments of all belligerent countries, and indicated that the government had put forward this proposal to the peoples and governments of all belligerent countries.

Therefore, the circular that said the Soviet government decided not only to maintain diplomatic relations with the governments of various countries but also to maintain diplomatic relations with the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which aims to overthrow the current governments of various countries, does not exist. This is pure fabrication.

Similarly, the words of the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Suslov, were also distorted. He was then the editor of Pravda. Suslov, in his speech on the defense of peace and the struggle against war-mongers in 1949, said: "Various different methods and methods should be used to unite the broad masses of the people to struggle for peace: mass demonstrations, meetings, rallies, drafting petitions and protests, opinion polls, organizing peace committees in cities and villages (this, for example, is a method widely used in France and Italy)."

Mansfield omitted the sentence "various different methods and methods should be used to unite the broad masses of the people to struggle for peace." However, this sentence is the main one, because the purpose determines the method. It is precisely this sentence about the purpose, about the crux of the matter, "the struggle for peace," that you, Mr. Mansfield, omitted.

As for the words of Zhdanov quoted by Mansfield from his speech in 1947 about the Marshall Plan, he simply combined two sentences from pages at least five pages apart into a six-line sentence. Mansfield took the first three lines from one page, then flipped through five pages, and took the last three lines from the last page, combining them together and reading them here. This is truly the ultimate in distortion. But that's not all. The main thing is: when he talked about our opposition to the Marshall Plan, he did not talk about the most fundamental thing at all.

The fundamental thing is that Zhdanov pointed out that the goal pursued by the Marshall Plan is the expansion of other countries—making certain countries financially and economically dependent on the United States, making the whole world subject to American imperialism.

Mansfield did not mention that the fact that determined the attitude of the Soviet Union towards the Marshall Plan was precisely this fact: the plan reflected the new reactionary and expansionist policy of American policy, aiming to fight against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, against all anti-imperialist liberation forces in all countries.

Zhdanov's speech correctly pointed out a fact, but Mansfield deliberately omitted it, not mentioning a single word. This fact is that American reactionaries, seeing the victory of Soviet socialism, the victory of the people's democratic countries, and the strengthening of the workers' democratic movement in the post-war world, were shocked, and they wanted to pose as the "saviors" of the capitalist system.

Zhdanov said that the American plan of open expansion made one think of the shameful failure of the fascist invaders' adventurous plans. American diplomacy adopted the methods of intimidation, bribery, and extortion, forcing other capitalist countries, first and foremost Britain, to agree to give the United States a legal form in Europe and Asia, in West Germany, in Austria, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan, Japan, and other places.

This is what Zhdanov said in 1947 when he explained the attitude of our country towards the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan wanted to lead the world down this disastrous path, but everyone knows that this attempt has completely failed. However, Mansfield did not mention a single word about this aspect, thus distorting our attitude.

Mansfield and others tried their best to prove that the peace committees of various countries are tools of Soviet foreign policy. This statement is naturally not worth refuting.

The peace committees of various countries have united billions of people from different classes and social groups, different religions and political beliefs in various countries. To say that the powerful people's movement for peace in the world is a movement directed by Soviet foreign policy is absurd, it is extremely stupid.

This is a gross distortion of the facts, a clear slander, because in reality, the efforts of the peace-loving people of various countries who yearn for peace and strive to avoid the threat of a new world war are a natural effort. They strive to prevent the disaster of a new world war, which will only bring disaster to mankind.

The goal of Soviet foreign policy is to consolidate peace and eliminate the threat of a new war. The reason why the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union is trusted by hundreds of millions of people in various countries around the world is precisely because this policy is consistent with the wishes, hopes, and efforts of hundreds of millions of people. The people believe that the forces of peace will definitely defeat the evil forces of war.

Even more ridiculous is Mansfield's statement, according to which the peace committees of various countries are part of a general organization established to take direct action. What is this "direct action"? Is it a method of violent struggle? However, everyone knows that the direct action of the peace committees of various countries is to make the people determined to prevent a new war from being launched. This is indeed what those who organize new wars are afraid of. These people have made incredible profits from wars, even from the preparations for new wars.

Mansfield and his colleagues are very unhappy because the cause of peace is gaining more and more supporters every day. Therefore, they are frantically trying to sabotage the cause of peace and hinder the efforts of the people of various countries to prevent the danger of war. However, we believe that these attempts will definitely meet with complete failure...

The Korean issue confirms: American interventionists and the Lee Syngman clique planned to attack North Korea

I have to mention the part of Mansfield's speech on the Korean issue, where he again tried to portray the war waged by American interventionists in Korea as an invasion of North Korea by the Soviet Union. However, gentlemen, you all remember, at least some of you remember, and the rest know from documents, that the issue of invading Korea has been thoroughly discussed in the First Committee of the Fifth Session.

At that time, we cited documents and facts to expose this lie, revealing how the Lee Syngman clique and the United States planned to attack North Korea, and how the United States later launched an armed attack on North Korea. We cited countless facts and documents, but we never heard anyone deny these facts and documents. No one presented other documents to refute these documents, no one raised any objections to these documents, not even those who wanted to refute them, only some representatives, especially those from New Zealand and Australia, made groundless denials and started cursing.

At that time, when I spoke in the First Committee, I quoted part of a letter written by Lee Syngman to Professor Oliver of Pennsylvania State University. I quoted the part of the letter exactly, in which Lee Syngman wrote: "Psychologically, it is the most opportune time to take offensive measures and, in conjunction with the part of the North Korean army loyal to the South Korean government, to annihilate the rest of the army."

In this letter, Lee Syngman promised that the South Korean army could drive part of Kim Il-sung's forces into the mountains and let them starve to death there.

At that time, Professor Oliver had published a letter to confirm that he had indeed received Lee Syngman's letter and that the contents of the letter were exactly the same as what I read in the First Committee.

At that time, I quoted a letter from the South Korean ambassador to the United States, Cho Byung-ok, dated October 12, 1949, which openly stated that the plan to destroy the North Korean government should be regarded as the basic plan of the Lee Syngman government, and as soon as the Lee Syngman government was ready and the opportune moment came, it should implement this plan. Obviously, in June 1950, the opportune moment had come.

I also published another document, which was a letter from the same Ambassador Cho Byung-ok to Lee Syngman himself, dated November 3, 1949. The letter said: "Only by exercising our government's sovereignty can we achieve the unification of Korea. Any policy advocating talks between the two sides or compromise is useless."

Finally, on December 30, 1949, just before North Korea was attacked, Lee Syngman said at a press conference: "We must remember that due to changes in the international situation, in the new year, we must unite South Korea and North Korea with our own strength."

I quoted the fourth, fifth, sixth, and up to the tenth documents of a similar nature. These documents all clearly stated: the war against North Korea had been decided (General Roberts); it was said that in the struggle against communism, the United States would provide South Korea with all necessary moral and material support (Dulles, June 19); it was said that preparations for the attack on North Korea should be made intensively in July and August (U.S. Ambassador to Korea, Muccio); and it was said that in the weeks before the outbreak of the Korean War, the South Korean army had been deployed along the 38th parallel, ready to strike at any time.

However, gentlemen, when we discussed this issue specifically at that time, why didn't you say anything? At that time, you did not deny the aforementioned documents, not even a bit. Now, you have found the courage to slander us and make up all kinds of absurd stories out of thin air.

The invaders say they are defending themselves against aggression. Since you did not speak up at that time, it would be better if you did not speak up now; since you did not raise objections at that time, it would be better if you did not raise objections now. Otherwise, those who know the truth of this matter will laugh at your accusations today, which are based on nothing but empty words.

Two American spies infiltrating the Soviet Union and a U.S. military plane invading Hungary, proving that the aggressive "October 10th Law" is in effect

As for the October 10th Law, the American representative wants to prove that this law is just a law, a purely theoretical thing with no practical significance, because it is said that there have been no specific actions taken because of this law. But all this is nonsense. Just look at the following facts, and it is clear that this is very obvious. Not long ago, the Military Court of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union tried two American saboteurs—Osmanov and Saranchiev, both of whom were wartime refugees, exactly the kind of refugees that the United States is systematically recruiting and plans to continue recruiting to serve it. These two saboteurs parachuted from an American plane into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in August of this year, but they were captured. They were found in possession of forged documents, weapons, poisons, and other items needed for sabotage and terrorist activities, as well as a large sum of money.

Incidentally, this incident should be specially notified to the Greek representative: according to the December 20th "New York Herald Tribune," these two American spies were specially trained in Greece, where they learned topography, parachuting, and methods of organizing sabotage and terrorist activities. They were accompanied by American officers and flew from Greece to their landing site on an American plane. According to the information I am quoting from the "New York Herald Tribune" now, the two spies and saboteurs who landed by parachute seemed to have received instructions from their superiors to go to Turkey after completing their mission, where they would meet with American intelligence personnel. Now, due to reasons beyond their control, they cannot meet in Turkey.

Mr. Mansfield and those defending the October 10th Law: now please tell us: are all these things—forged documents, weapons, poisons, and other items for sabotage and terrorist activities—standard equipment on this plane? Can they be said to be standard necessities for ordinary flights in the European region? Is the statement made by Mr. Mansfield here and the statement made by the State Department on December 18th (regarding a U.S. transport plane that flew over Hungarian and Romanian territory in early December and was later forced to land by Soviet fighter jets) true?

The two captured American spies admitted that they were originally wartime refugees in West German refugee camps and were later recruited by the West German American intelligence agency, receiving initial training in espionage, sabotage, and terrorist activities.

After investigation and trial, it was confirmed that after Osmanov and Saranchiev completed their training in sabotage activities, they were sent to Greece, where they were accompanied by American officers and flew to the Soviet border on an American plane, parachuting in. During the trial, the defendants Osmanov and Saranchiev confessed to their crimes without reservation.

The State Department's circular and Mansfield's explanation tried to prove that the U.S. military plane flying into Hungarian and Romanian airspace was not an unusual event, just an accidental incident due to the plane losing its way. They also tried to prove that the felt in the plane was prepared according to some order, and that this order had some regulations allowing the plane to carry all necessary items and equipment for the convenience of the people on board. However, at the same time, they did not dare to mention a fact: maps, poisons, and other such "equipment." What did Osmanov and Saranchiev need weapons and poisons for? The plane that was said to be lost was carrying maps of the Ukrainian Republic and the Volga region, and was it prepared for some emergency? If we study these facts, if we remember the circulars of the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, which listed countless examples of such American spy activities, if we study the activities of these spy agencies serving your so-called defensive Atlantic Pact, it is very clear: the claim that the law to support these measures, the October 10th Law, is just an abstract law that has not yet been implemented, is how groundless.

This law has already been implemented and is being implemented now. Its purpose is clearly stated by itself, and no one dares to deny this.

Therefore, the Soviet delegation fully insists on the original proposal submitted to the First Committee and the General Assembly for consideration: "The General Assembly condemns the '1951 Mutual Security Law' passed by the United States, which appropriates funds to support sabotage activities against many countries, as an act of aggression and interference in the internal affairs of other countries. This is incompatible with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the generally accepted norms of international law. The General Assembly recommends that the United States government take necessary measures to repeal this law."

    论美利坚合众国的侵略行动和对其他国家内政的干涉
    ——维辛斯基十二月二十一日在联合国大会政治委员会上的演说
    许多国家代表团的代表都在这里发了言，他们都各有自己的一套说法。但是，如果有人想确定这些发言的总方针，而试图把这些发言（姑且这样说）归为一类，我觉得这样做似乎是完全正确的，而且是完全符合事情的真正情况的。我们必须记住：加拿大、比利时、国民党、哥斯达黎加、南斯拉夫、巴西等等国家的代表——恕我把我的邻座英国代表也列入这里面——都是北大西洋侵略集团的成员，要不然就是跟在这集团屁股后面走的国家，这就决定了他们对某一问题的态度。
    因此，他们在这里竞相发出种种的诽谤和谰言，诬蔑苏联和人民民主国家，疯狂地憎恨它们，这是并不奇怪的。要希望他们能说些别的什么，那才真是怪事。
    他们都完全倚赖他们的主子，他们现在在很大程度上倚赖他们的主子的钱勉强过活。如果说，他们会有别的表现，忽然决定不履行他们的这个职务——对主子的任务和责任，那才是怪事呢。
    这不仅适用于我这里已经指出其名的代表，而且也适用于一切曾在这里假仁假义地发言的代表，如巴西代表那样。我要说：这种发言是愚昧无知的，特意歪曲真相的。
    发出这样恶毒的言语，其原因何在，是非常明显的。目前正在讨论的是很重要的问题，问题在于苏联是屹立在新的世界大战的道路上的主要的重大障碍，我应该说是不可逾越的障碍，这就阻碍了你们这个要把人类推入这次战争的深渊的北大西洋侵略集团的去路——这正是这些人攻击苏联的主要原因。
    我们提出对美国的控诉，同时也就是大声疾呼反对战争。我们要始终如一地坚持我们这种态度，而且要坚持到底。这并不是开玩笑的事，先生们。十月十日法和我们对这个法的抗议并不是圣诞节玩具，像太爱开玩笑的加拿大代表和其他某些太爱开玩笑的青年人有点不自量力地说的那样。
    美代表和他的走狗为“十月十日法”进行狡辩，歪曲真相
    十月十日法是在走向新的世界大战的道路上向前迈进的又一步。然而，我们又听说，这样一个法据说是永远用不着施行的，这个法永远不会被利用来达到这些“疯狂的目的”，孟斯菲尔德先生昨天在这里就是这样说的。听到这些话，真使人感到又好笑又奇怪——连你们说这些话的人自己也不相信这些话。
    你们知道，法律定下来，并不是为了不付诸实施的，并不是为了不用它们来作实际行动的根据的。法律定了下来，是为了指导实际行动，是为了使这些实际行动取得某些因这一法律的实行而能预期的实际效果的。因此，所谓法律仍然不等于行动这种规避之辞和诡辩，像美国代表葛罗斯在总务委员会上所说的那样，是完全不能成立的。不，法律就是行动，每一条法律从它被批准的一刻起，从它开始施行的一刻起，就产生效力。然而，也有这样的情形：某一法律所规定的行动是原来早就存在的，而法律是以后才批准的。十月十日法和克尔斯坦修正案的情形恰恰就是这样。事情恰恰是这样，因为早在这个法没有颁布以前，早在国会还没有以一九五一年十月的决定赋与它以法律的形式以前，就早有了这种行动。
    今天，我愿再一次努力对这个法的意义作一个通俗的解释。但是，我预先声明，我认为完全不必要和这些先生们一一进行论争，和他们辩论也是徒然的，他们在这里想向美国献媚，他们不是起来反对或批评我们的态度，而是粗暴地诽谤我们的国家。我不打算和他们进行辩论——不论是比利时的代表或哥斯达黎加的代表团也好，还是国民党的美国老走狗或铁托集团的代表也好，还是些别的什么代表团的代表也好。他们当中有一些人，像国民党和铁托集团的代表，在这里竭尽他们的力量，诬蔑苏联的政策；另外有一些人今天在会上按着美国事先给予的指示发言，重述一遍他们的主人对他们说的话，不幸这一类代表团也并不在少数。我愿意谈谈主人。为了以后不再重复起见，我打算先就劳埃德先生的发言简单地说几句。如果不谈他在这里再次谈到的而且是使他感到不安的牛，如果不谈这条不幸的牛，劳埃德先生还说了些什么呢？我很留心听他发言，他手里挥舞着一些文件，装模作样地想引用些什么来证明应该怎样去正确地理解十月十日法，然而他并没有证明了什么。
    他提到第七○三号报告，硬说这个报告一定对十月十日法和克尔斯坦修正案作了真正和正确的解释。他甚至念了几句，但是这还是从十月十日法修正案上引来的，根本算不上什么“对法律的解释”。这是势所必然的，因为除了我在这里宣读的文件以外，劳埃德先生没有别的什么文件可以解释十月十日法了。我很荣幸能在第一委员会这里宣读了许多文件，我逐页逐页地念，逐行逐行地念，指出这些谈话发表的日期，指出它们在官方记录中的页数。可是，对于这些文件，不论劳埃德也好，孟斯菲尔德也好，还是他们一伙中的任何人也好，都觉得不值一提。
    的确，我在这里引用了像提出这个法案的克尔斯坦本人和孟斯菲尔德的同事伏利斯（他也是美国代表团的团员和提出这个修正案的人，无论如何他是那些赞同这个修正案的国会议员中的一个）这样的权威人士的证言，我又引证了国会议员阿姆斯特朗、库莱、李查兹、莫兰诺、前助理国务卿柏耳和我们大家都知道的国务院顾问杜勒斯所作的解释，是不是有人在这里对我所提的证据提出了什么反驳呢？孟斯菲尔德或者其他任何人对我们在这里引用的所有文件，在这一个时期内是不是提出过丝毫修正呢？我们在这里引用所有这些文件时所说的话，他们是不是反驳过一次呢？他们没有反驳我们的话，可是他们却天真地说：因为没有所谓证据，所以什么东西也证明不了！他们竟敢假装那种高贵的样子说：如果控诉某个国家，就得提出证据来。我们已经这样做了，证据已经提出来了。可能有人说我们提出来的证据是不能令人满意的，没有说服力量的。但是，在这种情况下，那些说这种话的人就必须证明这种证据为什么不能令人满意和没有说服力量。但是他们说过些什么呢？他们说：这里所引用的是某些国会议员的发言，但是国会是由五百三十一个男女议员组成的，国会议员个人的意见不是国会的意见。但是我请问：国会同意了这些意见没有？你们作为国会议员是同意这种意见的，伏利斯也同意这种意见，克尔斯坦也同意这种意见，克尔斯坦的修正案是国会通过了的；克尔斯坦曾教给奥斯汀说，不用恐怖手段是不能进行这个像你们所说的
    “解放”运动的。
    在说明所有这些情况之后，我要问问你们：究竟是国会呢还是国会议员个人呢？难道国会不是由那些决定问题和对他们所已采取的决定表示意见的国会议员组成的吗？我们所谈的正是这些意见。解释法律的主要原则就是要确定立法机关本身对于法律的意见。可是，立法机关的意见是由立法机关的立法人员来反映的，立法机关的意见是由这些人员的意见形成的。除了我在这里所引用的意见以外，你们如果还能够提出其他任何意见，那末，你们就有权利说：这才真正是国会的意见，而不是克尔斯坦的意见，不是莫兰诺的意见，不是阿姆斯特朗的意见，不是孟斯菲尔德的意见，不是伏利斯的意见，不是某一个萨布洛斯基的意见等等。你们没有这样做，因为你们不能这样做，你们不能这样做是因为你们没有任何材料使你们可以这样做——我说：绝没有这种材料！
    因此，我必须提醒委员会的全体委员注意：孟斯菲尔德先生在这里说，苏联应当提出具有说服力的证据，来证明它对于美国的控诉是有事实作为根据的；但是苏联并没有提出这种证据。某些支持他的代表也跟着他学舌，说出同样的话来。他们这种说法是完全没有根据的。证据已经提出来了。像劳埃德先生今天所说的，这里已经研究过这种证据。这种证据一点也没有受到反驳，对于你们所重视的人们所作的解释，你们也没有提出一点修正，因此，必然无可争辩的是：这些解释和我们的证据是具有充分证明力量的真正的证据，我们的证据是律师们所说的证据确凿的证据，也就是第一手的、最可靠的证据。
    当然，你们都记得这个证据是由什么构成的。我愿意要求政治委员会的委员们认真地对待这个问题；不要赶快结束对这个问题的讨论，以致使这个问题得不到一个水落石出，得不到广泛的研究。我愿意请他们研究大家都可以看到的会议记录，今年七月十九日、七月二十五日、十月十日和十月二十日美国众议院外交委员会会议的记录；这些记录中，载着美国所有国会议员所提出的足够明确的解释，上次我已照实在情形提到了这些解释——没有人怀疑这一点，也不能有什么怀疑；也没有人提出修正或者甚至驳斥。
    先生们，这些都是事实。当然，你们能够使驯服的多数投票赞成你们唆使通过的东西。但是，你们绝没有权利说我们还没有证明这件事情。我知道你们当中有些人会投票反对此事的，因为在讨论这个问题的实质时，你们一句话也不说，现在你们仍然不说话，并且将来你们也不会说话的。
    我准备请求延长我们的讨论，让这个证据得到彻底的研究。让大家来讨论。
    你们不会这样做，因为你们不敢这样做。你们不可能这样做，因为你们没有可以与我们的论点和证据相颉抗的证据。
    美国官方记录证实了美国犯罪行为，决不容美代表矢口抵赖
    为了结束对这个问题的谈论，我认为有必要完全根据美国国会议员在众议院外交委员会所提出的解释来总结一下我们已经证明了的东西。他们说了些什么呢？他们又供认了一些什么呢？
    他们首先承认十月十日法的修正案是和这个法相结合的，因此，整个十月十日法的目的，也就是要从那些从苏联和人民民主国家逃出来的所谓“逃亡者”中招募人员或整个集团，给他们以经济上的援助，把他们组成军队，把他们组成像个人一样的能利用来执行大西洋集团的计划的这种武装集团。什么计划呢？你们说是“防御”计划。我们认为这些计划并不是防御计划而是侵略计划。但是，我们还是暂时不要考虑这是那种性质的计划的问题吧；无论如何，这是大西洋集团的计划。
    首先，这里就是这些国会议员们所作的证明。你们能否认吗？你们不能，而且也不否认这件事。
    其次，他们承认，组织这种军队和招募那些特别挑选的、从苏联和人民民主国家逃亡出来的人以及住在这些国家领土内的人参与这种军事措施，其目的，就像杜勒斯所说的，是建立起强大的攻击部队，把这种部队驻扎在苏联周围的要地，用它作工具，去摧毁根据这些国家的人民的自由意志而建立起来的巩固的政权、国家和社会制度。
    第三，他们承认，这些招募来对上述国家从事敌对活动的军队和个人要在美国和大西洋集团其他国家的领土上组成，或者在上述的那些国家的领土上组成。至于组织这种部队的经费，就是那为了这个目的而拨出的一亿美元。
    第四，他们承认，这些军队组成后，要成为民族的军队，有它们本民族的军旗、军徽，并且由它们本民族的军官来指挥。
    第五，他们承认，这些军队要以民族军团的资格加入大西洋集团军队。同时也就是说它们可能加入所谓欧洲军。
    第六，他们承认，除了把他们组成军队以便达到我上面所说的种种目的以外，还要利用从战犯、叛徒和其他所谓流亡者中选出来的个别集团或个人来威胁上述国家的人民（据国会议员说是为了恐吓），并且要利用他们来从事恐怖活动。这一点，据这个修正案的作者克尔斯坦说，在实现支持东欧国家的所谓“解放”运动的计划中，必须占很重要的地位。
    这就是许多先生们在众议院的委员会内外所谈到的关于十月十日法的种种话。根据美国众议院外交委员会发表的正式文件，我们分明能够得到至少六个结论，这六点我们在上面已经指出来了。
    没有一个人（甚至美国的官方代表也一样）想说
    一句话来更正——或者退一步说，来反驳我们所说的任何事情，这件事并不是偶然的。这一点是很明白的，因为驳斥别人需要有相当的材料和事实。去驳斥别人就是说要手里拿着文件，阅读并解释这些文件上所写的东西。我非常希望孟斯菲尔德和他的朋友试一下这样做。这样就可以看出来这一切是什么意思了，就可以看出来“恐怖”、“暴动”、
    “对铁幕的毁灭性打击”、“对克里姆林政权的摧毁性打击”等字眼是什么意思了。但是他们避而不做这件事。他们一味讲空话，这不是一个严肃的人对待这个问题应有的严肃态度；而且他们还一味矢口否认。只有一句话是他们翻来覆去地谈到的，这句话就是：“没有证明什么，没有举出什么证据。”这是在回答我们提出的一大批证据时说的。但是你们还要什么其他证据呢？证据当然还有，不过国会议员伏利斯拒绝在委员会的公开会议上把它们说出来。这是很可以理解的。在某些场合这些证据泄漏出来了，不管国会议员先生们怎样说，我以后还要谈这个。事实总是事实。十月十日法的真正目的已经昭然若揭了。反对和平与人类安全的罪行的法典草案从第六届联合国大会的议程上被取消了，就从这一个可耻的整个勾当中，也可以看出这个法的真正目的来。
    这个法典草案所以从议程上取消，是因为克尔斯坦和其他尊贵的国会议员们担心这个法典如果不取消就一定会通过，而这个法典的第二条规定必须宣布一个国家对另一国家进行的恐怖与颠覆活动为非法。这一条把克尔斯坦之流吓坏了，因为他们认为这一条如果被大会通过，就会妨碍国会通过十月十日法和克尔斯坦对这个法的修正案，无论如何也会使通过更困难些。关于这一点，我昨天已经谈得很详细了，今天我只想追述一下。
    这件事难道还没有充分明白、充分令人信服地说明了十月十日法和克尔斯坦修正案的意义何在，没有说明它们是为了什么目标、要达到怎样可疑而又可耻的目的吗？如果他们像我们那样，按照良心和自尊心的要求行事，彻底分析所有这些文件，向我们证明实际情况和我们对委员会所说的不同，那我是会了解的。可是支持美国的人们中间就没有一个人这样作，没有一个人曾经要否认什么事情，或者证明什么事情。
    他们这些可怜的鄙野的律师逃避了这个问题，甚至也没有要求延期举行会议，尽管延期举行会议也许是比较合适的。可是现在他们自己又硬说苏联没有提出什么证据或什么事实来了。不过，在他们这样说以前，我所引用的一切证据和事实都已提出来了，而且孟斯菲尔德和帮助他进行这件可耻的勾当的巴西、加拿大和其他国家的帮凶也绝没有提出什么论据来，为他们自己的立场辩解。
    你们认为在所有这一切以后，还有可能只凭简单的矢口否认就把真正具有说服力的事实一笔抹煞吗？你们可以用手来表决，可是你们不能用头脑来这样作。我们并不害怕这种表决，因为，我国的谚语说得好：真相像锥子，布袋藏不住。真相胜于雄辩，凡是重视真相、知道怎样保卫真相、要帮助真相战胜虚假的人，真相是总会传到他们的耳朵里的。我们绝不会被这种表决吓倒。
    “十月十日法”无可辩驳地证明了北大西洋公约的侵略性质
    上面所说的一切，十月十日法修正案的拟订者及其助手所提出来的一切解释，都把孟斯菲尔德在这里一再援引的这个修正案的真正意义说得一清二楚了，可是孟斯菲尔德还假惺惺地说：这个修正案真的没有包含甚么可恶的或是损害他人的东西。
    据孟斯菲尔德说，这个修正案规定要从那笔就要拨出的款项中提出不超过一亿美元的款项，以便把那些从铁幕后的国家逃出的逃亡者中间挑选出来的人组成一个支持北大西洋公约组织的军队。联合委员会既然接受了这种规定，就想表明：可能被编到这种部队里面去的人们，一定是自愿参加的。
    这是孟斯菲尔德在本月十九日说的话。本月二十日他又解释说：的确，国会的意思是要把根据十月十日法克尔斯坦修正案拨给的款项一亿美元交总统支配，好使从欧洲逃出来或者就要逃出的那些逃亡者，得以参加所谓北大西洋社会的防务。
    可是，拨出这一亿美元实际上是为了什么目的呢？为了组织军队。用哪些人来组织呢？用逃亡者。用什么样的逃亡者呢？用那些从苏联和人民民主国家逃亡出来的人，或者以后还可能从这些国家逃亡出来的人。这就是奉总统的命令花这笔款项去达到的目的。
    值得注意的是：孟斯菲尔德现在已经抛开了他那一套什么一亿美元法案是以慈善为目的的欺人之谈了，以前他说这笔款项是拨来救助那些受苦受难乞求这种美元援助的人的。克尔斯坦曾经明目张胆地说，据他自己了解，这一亿美元是要用来资助那些要参加大西洋公约武装部队的人的。这样看来，这就不是给那些贫苦无告需要物质援助的难民的援助，不是给穷人的援助了。援助不是给这些人的。首先，要援助的，照克尔斯坦说，是适合兵役的人；其次，照孟斯菲尔德说，他们并不是要帮助这些人去谋生，而是要收买他们，叫他们参加大西洋公约武装部队。这正是当代的瑞士雇佣兵。
    在这种场合难道还有人会被什么“防务”呀、大西洋集团的“解放”目的呀之类的说法欺骗吗？
    孟斯菲尔德罗罗嗦嗦地运用他所说的“颠倒黑白的话”，把战争叫作和平，把侵略叫作防御，把镇压和压迫人民的计划叫作解放运动……
    这种话的虚伪性，已经有人在这里揭露出来了。
    在一次会议上，埃及代表对美英代表唠唠叨叨地谈论美英两国政策的和平“防御”目的的话，提出了一个很好的答复。他说，到现在为止，这种政策就表现在英国开路机的功绩上，这些开路机把埃及公民的住房夷为平地，而且曾经多次把整个村庄夷为平地。
    为了掩饰这整套东西的非常可耻的、刺眼的颠覆恐怖性质，孟斯菲尔德昨天就以他所谓代表美国政府行政权力方面的美国代表团的团员身份说道：这个法是决不会被行政权力方面用来追求苏联代表团在本委员会会议上所说的那些狂妄目的的。
    可是这个法除了我国代表团所说的目的以外，是没有其他目的的；而且，如果考虑到为达到这些目的而作的种种活动一定要失败的话，这些目的也就的确可以说是狂妄的了。不过，虽然美国和其他某几个国家的侵略集团针对着苏联和人民民主国家而策划的阴谋确实是荒唐无稽的、疯狂的，可是这仍然是一项正在实行的计划。
    美国代表所说的话，并不是没有藏着政治诡计的。因为他后来又说，关于使用这种我们知道是为了对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆活动和敌对活动的军队的问题，仍然有待大西洋公约国家共同协商决定，而且如果这种部队得以组成，这种部队也是要用来反对侵略的。
    这里我们又碰见那种玩弄字眼的把戏了：什么侵略呀，防御呀等等。
    这显然是想把责任硬推在大西洋集团其他成员国身上，对于这些国家，美国答应过将来在这个问题上要和它们磋商，虽然更合常规的似乎应该是相反的程序和相反的次序——如果一个人稍为尊重他的盟友，他就应该首先和盟友们磋商，然后才来制订使这些盟友负有某种义务的法律。但是，这毕竟是大西洋集团成员国的家务事，和我们的关系不大。
    这就充分暴露了想把苏联向大会提出美国应遵守秩序和取消十月十日法的这个建议说成是诽谤美国和破坏大西洋集团某些假想的防御性措施的那种企图，已经完全破产。事实毕竟是：十月十日法和克尔斯坦的修正案前所未闻地违反了国际法的基本原则和标准。毫无疑问，这正是奥斯汀在写信给克尔斯坦时所考虑到的，他在信中说：今天世界形势所要求的和旧日的国际法有些不同。因此，国际法已过时了，它不能适应美国的政策，阻碍了美国的活动，也大大妨碍了整个大西洋集团的活动。这就证明了：奥斯汀所谈的旧国际法妨碍了美国外交政策目前的所谓新方针。这个法一定要加以修改。必须想出一些新的方法，来改进这个法和实施这个法。
    奥斯汀在写给克尔斯坦的信中竭力使他相信：凡是称得上联合国法典的法典，都必须承认当前这样重要的事实。这就是说：必须承认举世公认的国际法标准和原则现在是不合美国的意了，应当代之以新的国际法标准。这就是奥斯汀所说的“重要的事实”。这些新标准是怎样的标准呢？这些标准可以用两个词来形容：“外衣和匕首”！用关于“防御”的话作外衣来掩盖侵略的匕首！
    现在我们看到奥斯汀在他的信中所写的“新”字出现在克尔斯坦的修正案中，这个修正案取消了举世公认的国际法基本原则，抛弃了这些原则，并且用那些特殊的“新原则”来代替它们。这些新原则不是为加强各国人民间的合作的法开辟道路，而是为制造分裂与不和的无法无天的行为开辟广阔的道路；不是为国际法必须为之服务的和平开辟道路，而是为现在仍然受着这个法所阻止的战争开辟广阔的道路！这并不是偶然的。克尔斯坦对十月十日法的修正案是在侵略道路，在大西洋集团阵营所选择的道路上向前迈进的又一步。在这个阵营中，美国一直起着领导作用，并且执行着与此一致的外交政策。
    美国代表一再硬说大西洋集团——他把它叫做北大西洋公约组织或北大西洋社会——不是为了侵略，而完全是为了他所说的防御目的。可是，这是一个老问题，许多人老早就解决了的问题。但是，如果参照十月十日法和克尔斯坦修正案来看这个问题，那就可以断言：单是这个法，单是这个修正案
    （这个法和这个修正案的意义，已经完全由起草这个法和这个修正案的人自己所作的确准无误的解释确定了），就是一个最好的而且可能是无可辩驳的证据，恰好证明了大西洋公约的侵略性质。就算大西洋集团没有什么别的东西而只有这个批准拨款一亿美元来从事那种大西洋集团正在其他国家进行并且打算继续进行的颠覆活动的这个法，可是，单是这一项也就足以证明这个集团的真正侵略性质了！
    美国组织叛徒进行罪恶活动是对国际法及和平犯了滔天罪行
    请你们注意，一个和另外一个国家保持正常外交关系的国家在和平时期公开宣布在自己的领土上成立军事集团，并且为这个目的而招募居住在它境内的其他国家的国民，利用他们来和他们的祖国、和他们的国家作战，这是前所未有的。但是，美国政府不仅把居住在它境内的其他国家的许多国民组成这样的军事集团，而且还为自己定下了目标——它用自己的法公开宣布了这个目标，就是要成立类似的集团，并且招募这些国家个别的国民参加反对这些国家的合法政府的斗争。这是前所未闻的事情！
    自然，因为采取了这样的方针，所以也需要使国际法作与此相当的修改——修改它的原理、它的原则，修改公认的国际法原则和标准。这样作已经证实是必要的，因为十月十日法和克尔斯坦修正案所规定的那些措施，是和公认的国际法原则与标准不相容的。
    孟斯菲尔德先生至少要为美国政府这种前所未闻的措施找到了某种辩解。他说：当纳粹侵略者入侵苏联期间，苏联并没有拒绝把枪枝发给那些要求枪枝的外国人，并且这种外国人有很多在上次大战时期和红军并肩作战，就像侵略者占领下的国家有许多人民在西方和盟军一同作战一样。但是，这是谎诞的牵强附会，因为就是孟斯菲尔德先生也应该知道：现在的情形和过去是完全不能相提并论的，完全是两回事。前者是受到侵略者攻击的国家接受外国人的协助来抵抗进攻，这是一回事；而后者却是在和平时期，既没有受到进攻又没有受到进攻的威胁，一个国家却雇佣、收买别国的国民来组成武装部队，并且训练他们，以便在适当时机派遣他们去进攻他们自己的人民、自己的祖国，这又是另一回事。
    还应该指出：只有在战争已经发生的情况下，才可能有外国人对受进攻的国家作这种援助，这是和美国现在所作所为的没有一点相像的地方的。现在是和平时期，尤其是美国仍然和苏联保持正常外交关系，然而在美国境内却有人正在招募在战时被逐出苏联和人民民主国家的所谓战时难民，组织军队，准备在美国将来的反苏斗争中使用。
    我们之间有着正常外交关系，但同时在美国境内的苏联人民却正被组成军队，来对付苏联。
    他们在这样作的时候还说：“是的，我们正在组织这样的军队，训练他们，操练他们——但这只不过是对可怜的难民的‘援助’。”
    从什么时候开始容许这样的“援助”的呢？有谁听过这样的事情吗？
    在和平时期，美国政府拨出大批款项，组织和装备间谍、破坏者、恐怖分子和整批军队，为了这个目的而招募所谓难民——实际上是叛徒和卖国贼。当然，在这些人当中，有一些是受欺骗的，有一些饿得快要死了，他们再也没有想到他们的荣誉，他们想到的只是怎样取得至少是发霉的面包皮——但是，要是你们招揽这些人，要是你们叫这些人参加你们的军队，要是你们给他们穿上你们本国的军服，训练他们，发饷给他们，并且准备使他们参加将来对我们的武装进攻，那末，我们就有权说：你们对国际法、对国际法的原则、对这些国家间现存的正常外交关系、对和平犯了闻所未闻的滔天罪恶。我们有权这样说！我们也这样说了！
    在和平时期，就是现在，美国政府正在使这些人受军事训练，正在用飞机把他们投入苏联和人民民主国家境内，以便进行罪恶活动，反对这些国家现在的政府，反对它们的国家制度和社会制度。你们在干着这一切勾当，这是已经证实了的。
    我们说：孟斯菲尔德在这里所作的牵强附会的解释是荒谬绝伦的；尤其是因为苏联从来不曾在它的国境内组织过武装集团和军队来对付任何和它保持着外交关系的国家，所以这就更加荒谬了。
    孟斯菲尔德先生问我们：如果有一些愿在苏联定居的外国共产党人表示，一旦苏联受攻击，他们愿意起来保卫它，那样，苏联政权不是也会允许他们加入它的武装部队吗？
    但是，这里孟斯菲尔德先生表现得对问题非常无知，否则就是太莽撞了，有点“变来变去”。他光是在玩弄鬼计，希望这样至少可以把双方说成一样。
    问题完全是另外一回事。美国尽可以允许那些愿在美国定居并且愿在美国受别国攻击时保卫它的人在那里定居，在那里求得庇护之所，问题不在这里。
    问题完全是另外一回事。
    问题在于：（一）美国鼓励从其他国家逃出来的所谓难民大量涌入美国，这些难民适于服兵役，愿意受雇佣，愿意参加特种的军队，僭称为他们逃出来的国家的国军。（二）在动听的关于防御的虚伪言辞掩盖之下，他们被利用来实现侵略的目的。而还不仅用来实现这些目的，根据克尔斯坦修正案，还有其他的目的——据这个修正案的制订人克尔斯坦亲自供认，还有进行恐怖活动的目的，要在他们原来逃出的国家的领土内进行恐怖活动。（三）怀着这种目的，美国人有计划地使这些人用降落伞降落在这些国家境内，让他们按照美国情报机关和军事机关的领袖们的指示，进行罪恶活动。
    美国以逋逃权为藉口资助恐怖分子，违背一九三三年美苏协定
    至于孟斯菲尔德先生所问的那个问题，即苏联政府是否允许那些表示愿意保卫苏联的共产党人居留在它的领土内等等，如果他能够本着良心公正地看这个问题，他就可以从苏联部长会议主席斯大林
    一九三六年对美国斯克利浦斯—霍华德系报纸董事长霍华德的谈话中，找到详尽的答复。这个谈话和在这里所提出的问题有直接关系，并且是有很重大的意义的，所以我认为必须在这里全部引述一下霍华德的问题和苏联部长会议主席斯大林的答复。
    霍华德：“在苏联与美国建立外交关系时，罗斯福总统与李维诺夫先生，关于宣传问题曾经交换过同样的公文，在李维诺夫先生致罗斯福总统的信中的第四条内，曾载明苏联政府负有以下的义务：
    ‘不允许在自己的领土内组织或存在对整个美国或其一部分的领土或领地，志在推翻或准备推翻、或以武力改变政治社会制度之任何团体与组织，同时，在自己的领土内，要采取制止方法，以反对这类组织或团体及其代表或负责人员之活动。’我请你，斯大林先生，解释一下，倘若履行这条义务与苏联愿望不合，或不在苏联权力以内，则李维诺夫先生何以在这信上签名呢？”
    斯大林：“履行你所引证的这条义务，是我们权力以内的事，我们履行了这条义务，而且以后还是要履行。依照我们的宪法，政治侨民在苏联有居留权，我们给他们以逋逃的权利，正如美国给予政治侨民以逋逃的权利一样。很明显的，李维诺夫在该信上签名，是以信中所载之该项义务系双方都须履行为出发的。你，霍华德先生，现在美国有受美国公民物质上的帮助，为资本主义利益进行反苏宣传的白党侨民，他们有时且成为恐怖团体，这是否与罗斯福—李维诺夫的协定相抵触呢？显然，这些侨民正是享受了在美国也有着的逋逃权。至于我们方面，我们向来没有容忍在自己的领土内有任何暗杀分子的存在，不管他的罪恶行为是反对什么人。逋逃权的解说，在美国大概要比在我们国内更为广泛。好吧，我们也并没苛求于人。或许你不同意我，以为我们对于这些居留在我们领土内的政治侨民表示同情。但是，难道没有美国公民同情宣传拥护资本主义、反对苏联的白党政治侨民吗？那末，这里的问题究竟在什么地方呢？问题就在于不应当帮助他们，不应当在经济上帮助他们的活动；问题就在于两国当局人员不应干预别国的内部生活。我们的当局人员忠实地履行了这个义务。这些当局人员中，如有违犯义务者，请告诉给我们。
    倘若要奢求从美国逐出所有白党侨民，那就要侵犯在美国和苏联都宣布了的逋逃权了。这里应当承认，在双方提要求时是有一定的合理界限的。李维诺夫在其致罗斯福总统的信上签字，并不是以私人资格，而是以其国家代表的资格出面的。罗斯福总统的签字，同样也是如此。他们二人的协定，是两个国家的协定。无论苏联代表李维诺夫或美国代表罗斯福总统，当在这个协定上签字时，他们都是代表本国的，这两个国家不应而且不会去干预对方的内政。这个协定并不能抵触两国所宣布的逋逃权。应在这个范围内解说罗斯福—李维诺夫的协定，两个国家代表的协定。”
    这就是对在这里提出的问题的答复。这是早在一九三六年我国政府的领袖约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林提出的。这个答复非常清楚地把逋逃权的问题和现在正讨论的问题分开了。
    你们可以庇护你们所喜欢的任何人，就像我们有权让我们所愿意的任何人在我国避难一样。这不是问题所在。我们并不要侵犯我们宪法上明文规定的逋逃权；我们是说：你们，你们的政府，你们政府的官员没有权利援助白卫军和那些以反对苏维埃社会制度、推翻苏维埃政权为目标的分子。这并不是因为他们可能达到这个目的，而是因为这是一九三三年的协定所禁止的不道德的目的。你们的特务人员正在破坏一九三三年的协定，我们要求你们比他们诚恳些，道德些。
    从我读过的一些材料可以看出：第一，由于美国颁布十月十日法而引起的破坏美苏两国一九三三年协定的问题，必须不和逋逃权问题混为一谈；第二，逋逃权必须不和把这种权利给与恐怖分子一事混为一谈；第三，苏联政府不能，也永远不会容忍在它的领土上有一个恐怖分子，不论他的罪恶阴谋是算计谁的；第四，必须不把宣传拥护资本主义、反对苏联或者宣传拥护社会主义、反对资本主义这个问题和签订一九三三年协定的两国官员不得干涉其他国家的内政和内部生活的问题混为一谈。目前对我们说来最重要的就是：不得资助政治逃亡者去进行活动，不得通过美国的官方机构和那些同情逃亡的白卫军的人来帮助他们；第五点也是最后一点，一九三三年的协定规定美国和苏联的间谍们的活动不得也不应该干涉另一方的内政，美国也不得援助一切白卫军恐怖破坏分子及其他分子，不得为了这种目的而在美国的官方或非官方的机构帮助下甚至招募所谓“战时难民”。
    美代表和支持他的人竟无视真相对苏联的态度进行可耻的曲解
    孟斯菲尔德先生显然是不愿意了解这一点的。那些支持他的人，那些支持这桩美国极感兴趣的可耻的事情的人，显然也不愿意了解这一点，他们公然无视真相。
    在这里发言支持美国的人中间，有些人，首先是孟斯菲尔德先生本人，昨天和今天竟不怕直接曲解各种事实，无论如何都要为他们那种虚伪的态度辩解。
    举个例吧，孟斯菲尔德说，一九一七年，所有盟国和中立国驻彼得格勒的使节都收到了一件照会，据说照会内容如下：“苏维埃政权认为不仅有必要和各国政府维持外交关系，而且还有必要和那些以推翻现政府为目标的社会革命党维持外交关系。”但是只要细细看一下孟斯菲尔德所引用的话，立刻就能看出来那是一派鬼话。年青的苏维埃共和国的领袖竟然会这样幼稚地在给各国政府的照会上说：我们认为和你们，和当政的政府维持外交关系，同时又和那些竭力要推翻你们的革命政党维持外交关系，是相宜的！这简直是不可思议的事情，完全是胡说八道！
    事实上天地间根本没有这种照会存在。这完全是捏造，因为在一九一七年十一月八日（二十一日）发出的关于成立新政府——人民委员会——的唯一的照会中，只有关于在民族自决的原则下不割地不赔款的民主和平的停战协定的全文。苏维埃政府在这个照会中要求把这个声明认为是主张立即在所有战线上休战并且着手进行和平谈判的正式建议，并且指出，政府已把这个建议同时向一切交战国的人民和他们的政府提出。
    因此，说苏维埃政权决定不仅和各国政府保持外交关系，并且和那些以推翻各国现政府的社会革命党保持外交关系的这种照会，是不存在的。这纯粹是虚构。
    同样遭到歪曲的是被孟斯菲尔德援引的苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会书记苏斯洛夫的话。他当时是真理报的编辑。苏斯洛夫在一九四九年就保卫和平与对战争贩子的斗争发表演说道：“应该运用各种不同的方式、方法来团结人民的广大阶层去为和平而斗争：群众示威、大会、集会、拟定请愿书与抗议书、民意测验、在城市与乡村组织和平委员会（这，譬如说，就是一个在法、意两国广为运用的方法）。”
    孟斯菲尔德删去了“应该运用各种不同的方式、方法来团结人民的广大阶层去为和平而斗争”这句话。可是这句话是主要的，因为目的决定方法。正是这句关于目的的话，关于问题的症结“争取和平的斗争”的这句话，却被你孟斯菲尔德先生删去了。
    至于孟斯菲尔德援引日丹诺夫在一九四七年所发表的演说中谈到马歇尔计划的一段话时，他就把原文相隔至少有五页的两段话并成一共六行的一段话。孟斯菲尔德从一页上摘取了头三行，然后翻过了五页，从最后一页上又摘取了三行，把它们并在
    一起，在这里宣读起来。这真是极尽歪曲之能事。但这还在其次。主要的是：当他谈到我们反对马歇尔计划时，他根本就没有谈到最基本的东西。
    基本的东西是，日丹诺夫指出，马歇尔计划所追求的目标，就是对其他国家的扩张——使某些国家在财政上和经济上依赖美国，使整个世界受到美帝国主义的支配。
    孟斯菲尔德没有提到，决定苏联对马歇尔计划的态度的，正是这样一个事实：这个计划表现了美国政策的扩张主义的、反动的新方针，打算进行斗争，反对苏联和人民民主国家，反对一切国家中反帝国主义的解放力量。
    日丹诺夫的演说正确地指出了一个事实，但是孟斯菲尔德故意把它略过去，只字不谈。这个事实就是：美国反动分子因为看见苏联社会主义的胜利，看见人民民主国家的胜利和战后世界一切国家工人阶级民主运动的壮大而感到震惊，他们想以资本主义制度的“救主”自居。
    日丹诺夫说，美国那种公然进行扩张的计划，使人想起了已遭到可耻失败的法西斯侵略者的冒险计划。美国的外交采取了恫吓、贿赂、讹诈的方法，逼迫其他资本主义国家，首先是英国，同意给美国在欧洲和亚洲，在德国西部，在奥地利、意大利、希腊、土耳其、埃及、伊朗、阿富汗、日本等地方的地位以合法的形式。
    这就是日丹诺夫在一九四七年说明我国不赞成马歇尔计划的态度时所说的话。马歇尔计划要把世界引上这条多灾多难的道路，但是大家知道这个企图已经完全失败了。可是孟斯菲尔德对于这方面一字不提，这就歪曲了我们的态度。
    孟斯菲尔德及其他人竭尽全力要证明各国的和平委员会是执行苏联外交政策的工具。这种说法自然是不值一驳的。
    各国的和平委员会团结了各国不同的阶级和社会集团、不同的宗教与政治信仰的亿万人民。把世界各国争取和平的强大人民运动说成是苏联外交政策所指使的运动，这是荒谬的，是愚蠢透顶的。
    这是对事实真相的大大歪曲，是明显的诽谤，因为实际上，渴望和平、力求避免新世界大战威胁的各国爱好和平的人民的努力是一种自然而然的努力。他们努力阻止世界战争灾难再起，这种战争只会给人类带来灾难。
    苏联的外交政策所要达到的目标是：巩固和平和消除新战争的威胁。苏联的和平外交政策所以受到全世界各国千百万人民的信任，正是因为这个政策和千百万人民大众的愿望、希望和努力一致，人民大众都相信和平力量必定会战胜凶恶的战争力量。
    更可笑的是孟斯菲尔德的这种言论，据他说，各国和平委员会是为了采取直接行动而建立的总机构的一部分。这个“直接行动”是什么呢？是不是指暴力的斗争方法呢？但是，大家都知道，各国和平委员会的直接行动就是要使人民有决心阻止新战争被发动起来。这的确是组织新战争的人们所害怕的。这些人从战争中、甚至从新战争的准备中谋得了难以置信的巨额利润。
    孟斯菲尔德先生和他的同僚们感到很不高兴，因为和平事业一天比一天得到更多的拥护者。因此，他们就疯狂地企图破坏和平事业，阻挠各国人民防止战争危险的努力。但是我们相信这些企图一定要遭到彻底的失败……
    朝鲜问题证实：美国干涉者和李承晚分子有计划地进攻北朝鲜
    我不得不提一提孟斯菲尔德先生的演说中谈到朝鲜问题的那一部分，他在这里又想把美国干涉者在朝鲜进行的战争说成是北朝鲜在苏联支持下进行的侵略。但是，先生们，你们都记得，至少你们当中有许多人记得，其余的人也从文件中晓得，侵略朝鲜的这个问题已经在第五届大会第一委员会中详细讨论过了。
    那时，我们引证了一些文件和事实，揭露这个谎话，表明了李承晚分子和美国怎样有计划地准备进攻北朝鲜，美国后来又怎样对北朝鲜进行武装进攻。我们引证了无数事实和文件，但是，我们从来没有听到谁曾经否认过这些事实和文件。没有人提出别的文件来反驳这些文件，没有人对这些文件提出任何反驳，甚至没有人想去反驳它们，只有某些代表，特别是新西兰和澳大利亚的代表毫无根据地空口否认，并且谩骂起来。
    那时，在第一委员会发言时，我引用了李承晚写给美国宾夕法尼亚州奥利伏教授的信。我照原样地引了那封信的一部分，李承晚在这一部分里写道：从心理上说，采取进攻措施，并联合北朝鲜部分忠于南朝鲜政权的军队，来消灭其余的军队，现在是最适宜的时机。
    在这封信里，李承晚保证说，南朝鲜的军队可以把金日成的一部分人赶入山区，叫他们在那里活活饿死。
    那时，奥利伏教授曾为此而发表了一封信，证实他的确收到了李承晚这封信，并且证实那封信的内容和我在第一委员会里所宣读的完全一样。
    那时，我引用了南朝鲜驻美国大使赵炳玉一九四九年十月十二日的信，那封信公然说，应当把摧毁北朝鲜政府的计划看作李承晚政府的基本计划，只要李承晚政府准备好了，只要有利的时机到来了，它就应该实现这个计划。显然，在一九五○年六月二十五日，这个时机是到来了。
    我另外还公布了一个文件，就是这同一位赵炳玉大使写给李承晚本人的信，发信日期是一九四九年十一月三日。信里说：只有行使我们政府的主权，才能达到朝鲜的统一。任何主张双方会谈或是妥协的政策都是没有用的。
    最后，在一九四九年十二月三十日，也就是离北朝鲜受到进攻的日子相当近的时候，李承晚在一次记者招待会上说：我们必须记住，由于国际局势的变化，在新的一年里，我们必须用我们自己的力量把南朝鲜和北朝鲜统一起来。
    我引了第四、第五、第六以至第十件同样性质的文件。这些文件都明白地说：对北朝鲜进行战争是已经决定的事（罗伯茨将军语）；又说：在反对共产主义的斗争中，美国会给南朝鲜一切必要的道义支持和物质支持（杜勒斯六月十九日语）；又说：在七月和八月期间，必须为进攻北朝鲜作紧张的准备（美国驻朝鲜大使缪锡俄语）。
    本年十二月十五日，美国“民族”杂志发表的一篇文章说，在朝鲜战争爆发前好几个星期，南朝鲜军队就沿着三八线布置好了，随时都可以出击。
    但是，先生们，当我们那时专门讨论这个问题的时候，你们为什么都不作声呢？那时，你们没有否认上述文件，连一点点也没有否认。现在，你们鼓起了勇气，来诽谤我们，凭空捏造一切荒唐无稽的故事。
    侵略者说，他们在保卫自己抵抗侵略。你们那时既然不作声，现在最好还是不要作声；你们那时既然没有提出反对，现在最好也不要提出反对。不然的话，凡是知道这个问题的底细的人，都要笑话你们今天这些一点没有事实根据而只是空口说白话的指责。
    潜入苏联的两个美国间谍和侵入匈境的美军用机，说明侵略性的“十月十日法”已在施行
    至于十月十日法，美国代表要想证实这个法只不过是一个法，一种纯理论性而没有任何实际意义的东西，因为据说并没有因这个法而有什么具体行动。但这些全是废话。只要看一下以下的事实就可以知道这是十分明显的。不多几天以前，苏联最高法院军事法庭审讯了两个美国破坏者——奥斯曼诺夫和萨兰契夫，两人都是战时难民，正是美国在有计划地招募并打算继续招募来为它服务的那些难民。这两个破坏者在今年八月从美国飞机上跳伞降落在摩尔达维亚苏维埃共和国境内，但是他们被逮捕了。在他们身上搜查出伪造的文件、武器、毒药和其他进行破坏活动和恐怖活动所需要的物品，此外还搜出了大笔金钱。
    附带说一下，这件事特别要通知希腊代表：根据十二月二十日“纽约先驱论坛报”的消息，这两个美国间谍是在希腊受特别训练的，他们在那里学习地形学，学习跳伞和组织破坏活动与恐怖活动的方法。他们由美国军官陪着，从希腊乘美国飞机到他们降落的地点。根据我现在引用的“纽约先驱论坛报”的消息，跳伞着陆的这两个间谍和破坏者似乎还奉到上级指示，在完成任务以后就到土耳其去，在那里会见美国的情报人员。现在，由于不由他们作主的原因，他们当然不能在土耳其会面了。
    为十月十日法辩护的先生们：现在请你们告诉我们：这一切东西——伪造的文件、武器、毒药和其他进行破坏活动和恐怖活动的东西——难道可以说是这架飞机上的标准装备吗？难道可以说是在欧洲地区作通常飞行时标准的需要品吗？难道孟斯菲尔德先生在这里发言时的那种说法以及国务院十二月十八日的照会（关于一架美国运输机在十二月初飞越匈牙利和罗马尼亚领土，后来被苏联战斗机强迫降落的事）的那种说法，是确实的吗？
    那两个被捕获的美国间谍承认，他们原来是西德战时难民营里的战时难民，后来受西德的美国间谍机关招募，受了进行间谍、破坏和恐怖活动的初步训练。
    经过调查和审讯，证实了奥斯曼诺夫和萨兰契夫受完关于破坏活动的训练之后，就被送到希腊，在那里由美国军官陪着，乘美国飞机飞到苏联国境内，就跳伞着陆。在审讯当中，被告奥斯曼诺夫和萨兰契夫对他们的罪行供认不讳。
    国务院的照会和孟斯菲尔德的解释都想要证明美国军用飞机飞入匈牙利和罗马尼亚领空并不是什么不平凡的事，只是因为飞机迷失方向而发生的偶然事故。他们又想证明飞机里的毡子是根据某种命令而准备的，又说这项命令有一些规定，允许飞机上携带为机内人员的方便起见而必需的一切物品和装备。但是，同时他们却不敢提到一个事实：地图、毒药和其他这一类的“装备”。奥斯曼诺夫和萨兰契夫要武器和毒药等东西来干什么？那架美国飞机据说是迷失方向的，可是它带着乌克兰共和国和伏尔加地区的地图，又是准备在出什么意外的时候应用的呢？如果我们研究一下这些事实，如果我们记起保加利亚政府、匈牙利政府、罗马尼亚政府、捷克斯洛伐克政府和波兰政府那些列举了这类美国间谍活动无数事例的照会，如果我们研究一下这些为你们的所谓防御性的大西洋集团服务的间谍机构的活动，那就非常清楚：美国方面所谓资助这种措施的十月十日法不过是还没有开始施行的抽象的法的这一种说法，是怎样的毫无根据。
    这个法已经开始施行，而且现在正在施行着。它的目的是它自己一点也不含糊地宣告了的，没有人敢否认这一点。
    因此，苏联代表团完全坚持它原来提请第一委员会和大会考虑的下述建议： “大会谴责美利坚合众国通过规定拨款资助对许多国家的破坏活动的‘一九五一年共同安全法’为侵略行动及对其他国家内政的干涉。这是与联合国宪章的原则和普遍接受的国际法准则互不相容的。大会建议美利坚合众国政府采取必要措施以废除这一个法。”
