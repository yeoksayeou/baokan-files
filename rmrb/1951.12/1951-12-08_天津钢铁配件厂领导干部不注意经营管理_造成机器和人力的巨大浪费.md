    Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory Leaders Neglect Business Management, Resulting in Huge Waste of Machinery and Manpower
    To the Editor: In the past, the leading cadres of Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory only cared about production and not about management, resulting in serious waste of machinery, labor, and materials. Recently, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and conservation, the factory's leading cadres, based on the decision of the Tianjin Railway Administration, conducted an anti-waste inspection. Due to the unclear thinking of the leaders, the inspection was only superficial, so only some unimportant wastes were discovered (such as rework and trade union cadres being semi-detached from production), totaling more than 1.5 billion yuan. However, the serious waste was not discovered. For example, 50 percent of the factory's machines were not used. According to the current manpower, if they could be used, the annual production of general products (flat iron, square iron) would be worth more than 40 billion yuan. There are also sixteen machines that have not been installed, left in empty rooms and courtyards to rust. If only one of the rolling mills could be utilized, it could produce 79.8 billion yuan worth of goods a year. Moreover, in the machines currently in use, in addition to the direct production part, half of the potential capacity in the repair shop has not been utilized. For example, when lathe operator Yi Yueming was turning an axle, he had no material, so he went to the yard to find it. He found a piece and turned it halfway, but found that it had sand holes and could not be used, so he had to find another one. As a result, it took him more than five hours just to find the material, while turning the axle only took one and a half hours. Another example is that it takes two and a half days for a lathe operator to turn a rolled iron roller according to regulations; it just so happened that the roller in the rolling mill broke that night and was urgently needed, so a lathe operator was found at night and it only took two and a half hours to turn it. If this part of the strength can be fully utilized, it can increase the production value by 33.8 billion yuan per year. In the direct production part, the machine capacity is also not fully utilized. Only 80 percent of the direct workers in the factory are regularly working, and the rest are doing indirect work. Therefore, the indirect costs are particularly high, and each direct worker has to bear 898 percent, which is more than twice the rate stipulated by the Ministry of Railways (430 percent), which increases costs. There is also a great waste of materials. There are now more than 600 tons of round and flat iron in stock that are not being used, and there are also many other unusable dead materials. In addition to the backlog of working capital (approximately equivalent to the use of three and a half factories), just the loss of one item is more than 275.5 million yuan.
    Why is there such a big waste? The main reason is the unclear thinking of the leaders. The factory director once said: "Machines that are not installed do not count as waste." I hope that the relevant leaders will pay serious attention to this and resolutely correct it, so as to achieve greater victories in the increased production and conservation movement.

### 天津钢铁配件厂领导干部不注意经营管理  造成机器和人力的巨大浪费

    天津钢铁配件厂领导干部不注意经营管理
    造成机器和人力的巨大浪费
    编辑同志：天津钢铁配件厂领导干部以往只管生产，不管经营，造成了机器、劳动力、材料等方面的严重浪费。日前工厂领导干部为了响应毛主席增产节约的号召，根据天津铁路管理局的决定，进行了反浪费检查。由于领导思想不明确，只在表面上检查，所以只发现一些不重要的浪费（如返工活、工会干部半脱离生产等），总共有十五亿多元，但对严重的浪费部分却没有发现。例如：全厂机器有百分之五十没动用。按现有人力，如果能用上，每年可以生产一般产品（扁铁、方铁）价值达四百多亿元。还有十六部机器没安装，扔在空房和院里任它锈坏。仅其中轧钢机一部如能利用起来，一年可以生产价值七百九十八亿元。而且在现在使用的机器中，除直接生产部分外，在修配车间中，还有一半潜在能力没有发挥出来。例如：车工仪月明在镟轴时，没有材料，自己就到院里去找，找来镟半截时发现有砂眼，不能用，再去找；结果，光找材料用了五个多小时，而镟轴只用了一个半小时。再如车工镟轧铁滚子，规定时间用两天半；偏偏那天夜间压延间滚子折了要急用，结果夜里找来车工只用两小时半就镟完了。如果把这部分力量充分发挥出来，每年就可以增产价值三百三十八亿元。在直接生产部分，也不是完全发挥了机器能力的。全厂直接工经常干活的只有百分之八十，其余的都是做间接工作。因此，使得间接费用特别大，每个直接工人要分担百分之八百九十八，超过中央铁道部规定
    （百分之四百三十）的一倍多，提高了成本。在材料上也浪费很大。现在积存六百多吨圆、扁铁没有用，其它用不着的呆料也不少。除积压流动资金
    （约相等于三个半厂子用的）外，只是损失一项，就有二亿七千五百多万元。
    为什么会造成这么大的浪费呢？主要是领导思想不明确。厂长曾说过：“没装上的机器不算浪费。”我希望有关领导方面能严重注意，坚决纠正，以便在增产节约运动中得到更大的胜利。    杨恩庆
