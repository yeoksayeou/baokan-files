    Oppose Wasting the People's Time!
    Editor: Lenin severely criticized the situation of not respecting time and wasting time as "ugly and barbaric," which shows how much Lenin valued the people's time. In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, we should also pay attention to saving the people's time. However, according to the criticisms raised in the letters from readers of Guangming Daily on November 20th, Beijing Xinmin Daily on November 22nd, and Subo Daily, some organizations have not paid enough attention to this, thus wasting a lot of the people's time. For example, the Beijing Branch of the All-China Sports Federation held a football match meeting at the Xianongtan Stadium on November 18th, but failed to correct the time due to the use of old admission tickets, causing the audience to make a wasted trip. It is estimated that: (1) If the transportation cost is an average of 1,000 yuan per person, then for 4,000 people, 4 million yuan would be wasted. (2) In terms of time, the time wasted by 4,000 people is also very significant in total. Another example is the meeting of city-wide Party reporters, propagandists, and citizen propaganda team members convened by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall on November 15th, which was delayed by one hour, causing the 4,000 to 5,000 participants to waste 4,000 to 5,000 hours. The People's Education Center of Chongming County, Subo, announced that the film "Boundless Radiance" would be shown at Chongming Middle School at 6:30 pm on November 10th, but because the generator was not carefully inspected and tested before the screening, the motor broke down during the screening, causing more than 2,000 viewers (estimated) to wait from 6:00 pm until 9:30 pm without the film being shown. Assuming that each person wasted three hours, more than 6,000 hours were wasted. Similar situations of wasting the people's time due to lack of full preparation for meetings are not limited to these three cases, but are quite common phenomena in various places. Therefore, I hope that all localities and units will also conduct an inspection on the issue of time saving in the process of carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and formulate methods for improvement.

### 反对浪费群众的时间！

    反对浪费群众的时间！
    编辑同志：列宁曾把不遵守时间和浪费时间的情形，严厉地批评为“丑恶与野蛮”，足见列宁是如何珍惜群众的时间。在增产节约运动中，我们同样应注意节省群众的时间。可是据十一月二十日光明日报、二十二日北京新民报以及苏北日报读者来信所提出的批评，还有一些机关团体，对此并没有引起足够的重视，因而浪费了群众很多的时间。如中华全国体育总会北京市分会于十一月十八日在先农坛体育场举办的足球比赛大会，因利用旧参观券而没有改正时间，致观众空跑了一趟。据估计：（一）如交通费平均每人一千元，以四千人计，即要浪费四百万元。（二）时间方面，四千人浪费的时间，合起来也是很大的。又如十一月十五日中共北京市委员会宣传部在中山公园音乐堂所召集的全市党的报告员、宣传员和市民宣传队员大会，因迟开了一小时，致与会者四、五千人，就须浪费四、五千小时。苏北崇明县人民教育馆通告于十一月十日下午六时半在崇明中学放映“光芒万丈”影片，但由于放映前没有详细检查和试验发电机，到放映时马达坏了，使二千多观众（估计数），从六点一直等到九点半，还没有放映。以每人浪费三小时计，就浪费了六千余小时。类似这种因开会缺乏充分准备而浪费群众时间的事情，并不是只此三件，而是各地相当普遍存在着的现象。因此，我希望各地各单位，在开展增产节约运动中，把时间节约的问题，也附带地进行一次检查，并订出改进的办法来。
