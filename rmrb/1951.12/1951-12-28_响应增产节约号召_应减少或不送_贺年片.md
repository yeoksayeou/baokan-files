    Responding to the Call for Increased Production and Thrift: Reduce or Eliminate Sending "New Year's Cards"
    To the Editor: The New Year is approaching, and according to past practice, government agencies and stores in various regions exchange "New Year's cards" to express their congratulations. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call for "increased production and thrift," and in accordance with the spirit of "not spending on things that are between necessary and unnecessary," I believe that the expenditure on purchasing "New Year's cards" should be reduced as much as possible, or not spent at all. To express revolutionary friendship or exchange experiences, other means of communication can be used. Because not sending or reducing the number of "New Year's cards" can not only save the country a sum of expenses but also save a lot of paper.

### 响应增产节约号召  应减少或不送“贺年片”

    响应增产节约号召  应减少或不送“贺年片”
    编辑同志：新年就要到来，按照以往的习惯，各地机关商店都要互送“贺年片”表示庆贺。为了响应毛主席“增产节约”的号召，根据“介乎可开支可不开支的则不开支”的精神，购制“贺年片”的开支，我认为应当尽量减少，或是不开支。为表示革命友谊或交流经验，可以通过别的方式来联系。因为不送或少送“贺年片”不但可以给国家节省一笔开支，而且可以节省很多纸张。    赵炳翥
