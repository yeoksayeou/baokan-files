    Bureaucracy of Leading Cadres Leads to Corruption and Waste

    To the Editor: In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Suihua Branch of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau has uncovered many instances of corruption and waste. Wang Borong, the director of the materials factory of the Suihua Branch, has consistently colluded with private merchants to engage in corruption since 1946. Investigations have revealed that he embezzled railway materials worth 32 million yuan. Some purchasing agents in the materials factory were enticed by unscrupulous merchants and failed to inspect goods according to standards during procurement, resulting in many purchased materials being unusable and tying up large amounts of capital. After the movement was launched, these corrupt and wasteful elements still did not confess and repent until they were reported by others, at which point they admitted their actions. These facts have existed for a long time, but the leading cadres in the bureau have not paid attention to them. This bureaucratic style of work should be thoroughly eliminated. Gao Pengju

    齐齐哈尔铁路管理局绥化分局
    领导干部官僚主义，造成贪污浪费现象
    编辑同志：齐齐哈尔铁路管理局绥化分局在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，发现了很多贪污浪费现象。绥化分局材料厂长王柏容，自一九四六年到现在，一贯和私商勾结贪污。据调查，他盗卖铁路器材价值达三千二百万元。材料厂某些采购员被奸商引诱，买货时不按标准验收，结果，很多买到的器材无法使用，积压了大量资金。运动展开后，这些贪污浪费分子还不坦白悔过，直到被人检举出来，才承认了。这些事实很早就存在了，但局里领导干部却没有重视，这种官僚主义作风应彻底肃清。高鹏举
