    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Should Not Discard Scrap Iron
    Comrade Editor: Recently, along the stretch of road from the east gate of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to Beixin'an Village, from a little after seven in the morning until a little after four in the afternoon, many women and children have been coming with baskets and bags to collect scrap iron. In the scrap iron piles there are iron wires, small iron pieces, iron plates, iron sheets, and iron rods ranging from one to two *chi* in length. After the residents of nearby villages collect these items, some exchange them for bowls and pots along the way, some sell them for money, and some carry them home. Currently, state-owned enterprises across the country are launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and waste materials should be utilized. Why is the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant instead discarding scrap iron and not utilizing it? I believe that the relevant departments of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant should quickly stop the behavior of discarding scrap iron at will and find ways to utilize the scrap iron, so as to prevent the loss of people's property.

    石景山钢铁厂不应该抛弃废铁
    编辑同志：最近这些天，在石景山钢铁厂大东门到北辛安村的一段马路上，从早晨七点多钟到下午四点多钟，都有许多妇女小孩携筐提袋来拾废铁。那里的废铁堆里有一市尺到二市尺长的铁丝、小铁块、铁板、铁片、铁棍等。附近村里的居民拾到这些东西以后，有的在半途换盆碗，有的卖钱，也有的背回家去。目前全国国营企业正在开展增产节约运动，废物都要加以利用，石景山钢铁厂为什么反而把废铁抛弃不加以利用呢？我认为石景山钢铁厂有关部门应急速制止随便抛弃废铁的行为，并设法利用废铁，以免人民财产遭受损失。   何理
