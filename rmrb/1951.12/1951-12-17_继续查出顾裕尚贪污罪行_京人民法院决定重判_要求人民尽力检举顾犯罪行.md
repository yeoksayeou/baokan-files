[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Following the Beijing People's Court's verdict in the case of Gu Yushang, an employee of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, for extortion and bribery, new facts of embezzlement by the said criminal have been uncovered. The Beijing People's Court has decided to reinvestigate all of his crimes before issuing a new verdict. A public announcement was issued on November 24th, ordering those who had facilitated bribery for Gu or had offered bribes to Gu to surrender themselves to the authorities. It also hopes that those who are aware of or were victims of Gu's and his accomplices' extortion and other crimes will make every effort to report and expose them. The full text of the announcement is as follows:

This court has accepted the case of Gu Yushang, an employee of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, who impersonated the head of the Civil Trial Division of the said court and extorted bribes from Liu Fengxiang and others. After the verdict, accomplices Tu Zhanhua and Dong Guangxun further confessed that Gu had solicited even more bribes. The criminal has consistently aimed at soliciting bribes, colluding with some unemployed elements, running between Beijing and Tianjin, and extensively luring litigants, using fraud, extortion, and other means to extract bribes. For example, he extorted 58 million yuan from Wu Xiaozhou (with the facilitators of the bribery, Tu Zhanhua and others, obtaining an additional 8 million yuan); he extorted tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan each time from Cao Enrong, Zhao Shulin, and others; and he also attempted to solicit bribes from Sun Jingchen, Pu Taihe, the owner of the house east of Xisi South Street Li, and others. This court has decided to reinvestigate all of his crimes before issuing a new verdict. We hereby announce: All those who are aware of or were victims of the said criminal's and his accomplices' extortion and other crimes are urged to report them. Those whose reports are verified will be commended by this court. All those who have facilitated bribery, or have offered bribes to him, are required to report to this court in writing or orally within one month from the date of this announcement. Those who truthfully report themselves will be exempted from or given lenient treatment regarding their own criminal liability. If Duan Senlin, also known as Yinwu, who facilitated bribery for Gu and shared the bribes, and who originally resided at the Shoudetang pharmacy south of Guanyinsi West Entrance, should immediately comply with the above regulations and report to the court. Failure to do so will result in a wanted order and severe punishment. In order to eliminate the few corrupt elements, maintain the prestige of the People's Government, and safeguard the interests of the people, all the people are urged to do their utmost to report crimes.
