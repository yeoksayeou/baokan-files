　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to plan the construction of the western suburban cultural and educational district and use land rationally, the Beijing Municipal People's Government invited the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Finance, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese People's University, Tsinghua University and 26 other units on November 28 to discuss the issue of land use for construction in the cultural and educational district. First, Vice Mayor Wu Han reported on the development of the cultural and educational district over the past year and the existing problems, such as the lack of proper planning by some units before applying for land use; or the failure to engage in construction after requisitioning and purchasing land from farmers; or the lack of a clear understanding of the significance of reserved land; and some unreasonable phenomena in design; calling on all units to pay close attention. Representatives of all units unanimously agreed with Vice Mayor Wu's report. After discussion, preliminary regulations were stipulated: (1) In the future, when various units apply for construction land, they should first obtain the consent of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Ministry of Education, and apply for the purchase of land according to actual needs after the construction budget has been approved by the financial department; the construction plan must be approved by the Construction Bureau before construction can begin. (2) The architectural design of each unit must take into account the overall development of the cultural and educational district. Adjacent units should closely cooperate before construction to avoid unnecessary phenomena such as duplication, waste, and mutual hindrance. As for various public utilities, such as primary schools, hospitals, sports facilities, and cultural and entertainment venues, they should be designed by a unified agency to avoid the situation in the past where Tsinghua, Yenching, and other universities built walls and became self-contained. (3) The scope of land reserved for development by various units does not mean that the right to use it is allocated to the units, but only that the unit has priority to use that area. If it is necessary to change it according to the overall needs and development of the cultural and educational district, necessary adjustments should still be made. (4) After the land is approved, if it is found that the unit has not built according to the plan or does not need such a large area, the surplus land should be taken back by the Municipal People's Government and allocated to other units for use. (5) Without approval, units are not allowed to privately purchase land from farmers or arbitrarily measure farmland to avoid hindering farmers' production enthusiasm. (6) If the approved construction land is not built on time, it should be returned to the farmers for cultivation. The units must not use this land for agricultural production or to open brick kilns, pastures, etc.
    At the meeting, representatives of the Urban Planning Committee introduced the draft plan of the cultural and educational district and the interim standards for land use of universities and colleges: for general science and engineering schools, the maximum land use per person (including buildings and necessary open space) should not exceed 90 square meters; for general liberal arts and law schools, the maximum per person should not exceed 80 square meters. Finally, it was decided that the Urban Planning Committee would invite the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Financial and Economic Committee, the Construction Guidance Committee, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, etc., to form a small group on land use in the cultural and educational district to study the construction of the cultural and educational district, so as to better cooperate with each other and develop in a planned way.

　　北京市人民政府邀集有关单位
    商定使用文教区土地办法
    加强各单位建筑的计划性
    【北京市新闻处讯】为了有计划地建设西郊文教区，合理使用土地，北京市人民政府特于十一月二十八日邀请政务院文化教育委员会，教育部、文化部、财政部、中国科学院及中国人民大学、清华大学等二十六个单位，就文教区建筑用地问题加以商讨。首先由吴晗副市长报告了文教区一年来发展的情况和目前存在的一些问题，如某些单位申请用地前缺乏应有的计划；或于征购农民土地之后，并未从事建筑；或对于保留用地的意义，缺乏明确的认识；同时设计上也有些不合理的现象；提请各单位深切注意。各单位代表对吴副市长的报告一致表示赞同，经讨论后并初步规定：（一）以后各单位申请建筑用地时，应先征得政务院文化教育委员会和教育部的同意，并经财政部门批准建筑预算后，才能按实际需要申请购买土地；建筑施工计划必须建设局批准后才能动工。（二）各单位的建筑设计，必须照顾整个文教区的发展，毗邻各有关单位在兴建前并应密切配合，避免重复浪费和互相妨碍等不应有的现象。至于各种公共事业，如小学校、医院、体育设备、文化娱乐场所等，应由统一的机构从事设计，避免发生过去清华、燕京等圈砌围墙、自成局面的情况。（三）对各单位保留发展的用地范围，并不是把使用权拨归各单位，只能认为该单位有使用那个地区的优先权。如果根据文教区总的需要和发展情况必须改变时，仍然应该作必要的调整。（四）批准用地后，如果发现那个单位并没有按计划兴建或者并不需要那么大面积，多余的土地应当由市人民政府收回，拨交其他单位使用。（五）凡是没有经过批准的土地，各单位不得私自向农民购买，也不得随意丈量农地，以免妨碍农民生产情绪。（六）已经批准的建筑用地，如果不及时兴建，应退给农民耕种，各单位不得用这些土地从事农业生产，开设砖窑、牧场等。
    会上并由都市计划委员会代表介绍了文教区计划草案及高等学校用地的暂行标准：一般理工学校，每人用地（包括建筑和应有空地）最高不超过九十平方公尺；一般文法学校，每人最高不超过八十平方公尺。最后决定：由都市计划委员会邀请政务院文化教育委员会、财政经济委员会、建筑指导委员会和教育部、文化部等，组成一个关于文教区土地使用的小组，来研究文教区的建设，以便更好地互相配合，有计划地发展。
