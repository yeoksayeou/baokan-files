(I) Another Shameful Failure of Imperialist Spy Conspiracy

In the report made by Comrade Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on the 6th of this month, regarding the anti-Party and treasonous conspiracy case of Slánský, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and his accomplices, it was clearly revealed that Slánský and his accomplices were running dogs of class enemies who had infiltrated the revolutionary party of the working class—the Communist Party, and running dogs of domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialists. They lurked in the leading organs of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Republic's government, engaging in conspiracies, attempting to sell out the revolutionary cause of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Czechoslovak working class, and all the people to foreign imperialists, to restore capitalism in Czechoslovakia, and to prepare conditions for the war conspiracy of imperialist countries against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

However, this despicable and shameful anti-Party and treasonous conspiracy under the manipulation and instruction of imperialism has been exposed and cracked down on. Slánský and his accomplices have been successively expelled from the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, removed from their posts by the Republic's government, and arrested and are being interrogated. This has completely foiled the conspiracy of imperialism and its running dogs to turn Czechoslovakia into a second Yugoslavia. This is another heavy blow to the imperialist war preparation plan. Prior to this, the people's democratic countries had already cracked many espionage cases. Among them, the Kostov treason case in Bulgaria and the Rajk treason case in Hungary were both planned by American imperialism, which sent its running dogs to infiltrate the Communist Party and workers' parties, engage in treasonous conspiracies, attempt to subvert the people's democratic countries, undermine the prestige of the Communist Party and workers' parties among the masses, and attempt to achieve the goals of imperialist aggression. Recently, U.S. President Truman also signed a "Mutual Security Act of 1951," openly stipulating the appropriation of $100 million to subsidize spies and reactionaries to engage in subversive and destructive activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Therefore, the exposure of the Slánský and his accomplices' treason case is undoubtedly a heavy head-on blow to the destructive conspiracy of American imperialism.

The occurrence of the Slánský et al. treason case is not a special or accidental event. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is in a young stage of development, and the Czechoslovak Republic has not achieved victory for long. Abroad, imperialism is racking its brains to carry out sabotage against it; at home, the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie have not been thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, the class struggle is intensifying. This situation, as Comrade Stalin pointed out in "Defects in Party Work and Measures for Liquidating Trotskyites and Other Double-Dealers": "As long as capitalist encirclement exists, is it not obvious that assassins, spies, wreckers and murderers sent in by foreign espionage agencies will continue to be active in our rear?" This passage of Comrade Stalin is still equally applicable to all the people's democratic countries that are still under capitalist encirclement and the conspiracy and sabotage of internal and external reactionaries. Therefore, if we have not forgotten the realistic historical conditions, we will not "feel that something unexpected has happened."

The cracking of the Slánský et al. treason case and the firm and decisive handling of this case by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Republic's government fully demonstrate that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the people's democratic regime are strong and consolidated. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia pointed out to the criminals in this case at the plenary session in February this year: "In the past, there has not been and there will never be any running dog or traitor who can gain a foothold on our soil." Facts have also proved that the traitors have finally been captured and will soon be judged fairly by the people. After eliminating the traitors and spies lurking in the leading organs of the Party and government, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Republic's government will inevitably make the entire Party and all the people more closely united around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia headed by Comrade Gottwald, and advance victoriously for the great cause of building socialism. This is the most reliable guarantee for the continuous victory of the Czechoslovak people. The further strengthening and consolidation of the Czechoslovak Republic is undoubtedly a victory for the world peace and democracy camp. Therefore, peace-loving people of all countries will also be encouraged by this victory and strengthen their confidence in the cause of world peace and democracy.

The exposure of the Slánský et al. treason case once again proves that the struggle against the sabotage conspiracy of imperialist secret agents and spies is by no means a one-time task, but a long-term and daily task. Because no matter how tragic failures imperialism and its running dogs have suffered, they will never automatically give up their conspiracy and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Moreover, precisely because the cause of world peace and democracy and the cause of building the people's democratic countries are in an unprecedentedly victorious and developing situation, the sabotage conspiracy of imperialism and its running dogs is even more shameless. This situation requires the world's peace-loving people, especially communists, to work hard to heighten their vigilance, strengthen the education of Marxist-Leninist theory, so as to identify and expose the enemies who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks in time, and to defend the revolutionary interests of the working class and the people of all countries with the spirit of loyalty to proletarian internationalism and the spirit of loyalty to people's democracy and socialism.

The shameful failure of the anti-Party and treasonous conspiracy of Slánský and his accomplices proves that the people's democratic countries and the revolutionary parties of their working classes—the Communist Parties—can overcome enemies and achieve victory in all revolutionary struggles. This proves that socialism and the cause of people's democracy are invincible!

### （一）帝国主义间谍阴谋的又一可耻失败

    （一）帝国主义间谍阴谋的又一可耻失败
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会本月六日全体会议上作了关于捷克斯洛伐克共产党前总书记斯兰斯基及其同谋犯反党叛国阴谋案的报告。这个报告清楚地揭露了：斯兰斯基及其同谋犯是混入工人阶级革命政党——共产党中的阶级敌人的走狗，是国内反动派和外国帝国主义者的走狗。他们潜伏在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和共和国政府的领导机关内，从事阴谋活动，企图把捷克斯洛伐克共和国和捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级及全体人民的革命事业出卖给外国帝国主义者，使资本主义在捷克斯洛伐克复辟，并为帝国主义国家反对苏联和人民民主国家的战争阴谋准备条件。
    但是，这个在帝国主义操纵指使下的卑鄙可耻的反党叛国阴谋被揭露和破获了。斯兰斯基及其同谋犯已先后被捷克斯洛伐克共产党开除党籍，被共和国政府解除职务，并且被逮捕起来，正在加以审讯中。这就使得帝国主义及其走狗企图使捷克斯洛伐克变为南斯拉夫第二的阴谋遭到了完全的失败。这对于帝国主义的备战计划是又一次沉重的打击。在此以前，人民民主国家已经破获了许多间谍案件。其中如保加利亚的科斯托夫叛国案和匈牙利的拉伊克叛国案，就都是美国帝国主义有计划地派遣它们的走狗混入共产党和工人党，进行叛国阴谋活动，企图颠覆人民民主国家并破坏共产党和工人党在群众中的威信，企图实现帝国主义侵略的目的。最近，美国总统杜鲁门并曾签署了一项“一九五一年共同安全法”，公然规定拨款一亿美元资助间谍和反动分子，在苏联和人民民主国家从事颠覆与破坏活动。因此，现在斯兰斯基及其同谋犯叛国案件的被揭露，无疑地是对于美国帝国主义破坏阴谋的一个沉重的迎头打击。
    斯兰斯基等叛党叛国案件的发生，并不是什么特殊的意外事件。捷克斯洛伐克共产党正处在年青的发展时期，捷克斯洛伐克共和国取得胜利的时间也还不久。在国外，帝国主义正在处心积虑地对它进行破坏；在国内，资产阶级的反动势力还没有彻底被肃清，因此，阶级斗争日益激烈。这种情况，正如斯大林同志在“论党工作之缺点和消灭两面分子的办法”中所指出的：“只要资本主义的包围依然存在，则在我国后方便将继续有被外国侦探机关派来的暗害者、侦探、军事破坏工作者及杀人凶手从事活动，这岂不是显而易见的吗？”斯大林同志的这一段话，对于今天依然处在资本主义的包围和内外反动派的阴谋破坏中的各个人民民主国家说来，同样还是适合的。因此，如果我们没有忘记了现实的历史条件，我们就不会“感觉到事出意外”了。
    斯兰斯基等叛国案的破获以及捷克斯洛伐克共产党和共和国政府对这一案件坚决果断的处置，充分证明了捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民民主政权是坚强和巩固的。捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在今年二月的全体会议上就曾经向这个案件的罪犯们指明：“过去还没有而且将来也不会有任何走狗和叛徒能够在我们的国土上站稳脚根。”事实也证明了：叛徒们是终于被捕获了，并且即将受到人民公正的裁判了。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和共和国政府肃清了在党和政府领导机关内潜伏的叛徒和间谍之后，必然会使全党和全体人民更加紧密地团结在以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会的周围，为着建设社会主义的伟大事业而胜利前进。这是捷克斯洛伐克人民不断走向胜利的最可靠的保障。而捷克斯洛伐克共和国的进一步加强和巩固，无疑地是世界和平民主阵营的一个胜利。因此，各国爱好和平的人民也将从这个胜利中得到了鼓舞，并加强了他们对世界和平民主事业的信心。
    斯兰斯基等叛国案的揭露，又一次证明：对于帝国主义特务间谍破坏阴谋的斗争，决不是什么一劳永逸的事情，而是持久的、日常的任务。因为不管帝国主义及其走狗们已经遭受到怎样悲惨的失败，它们绝不会自动放弃对苏联和人民民主国家的阴谋破坏活动的，而且正因为世界和平民主事业和人民民主国家的建设事业处在空前胜利发展的形势中，所以帝国主义及其走狗的破坏阴谋也就更加无耻。这种情形，要求世界爱好和平人民首先是共产党人努力提高警惕，加强马克思列宁主义理论的教育，以便及时地识别和揭露混入革命队伍中的敌人，并以忠于工人阶级国际主义的精神，忠于人民民主与社会主义的精神，来保卫工人阶级和各国人民的革命利益。
    斯兰斯基及其同谋犯反党叛国阴谋的可耻失败，证明了人民民主国家及其工人阶级的革命政党——共产党，在一切革命斗争中都能战胜敌人，取得胜利。这证明社会主义和人民民主事业是无敌的！
