Xinhua News Agency, 7th:

    The failure of the recent North Atlantic Aggression Group's Council meeting in Rome has made the future of US war preparations in Western Europe even gloomier, a fact that the heads of government and bourgeois opinion in the North Atlantic countries can no longer conceal. According to Agence France-Presse, US Secretary of State Acheson, who had exhausted all means of coercion against the representatives of the Western European puppet states at the Rome meeting, had to publicly admit to reporters before leaving Italy to return to the United States on the 4th: "The Atlantic nations have not yet resolved the most serious difficulties they have encountered in the common defense organization. ... Greater efforts are still needed to resolve the important issues that remain to be resolved." Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, who attended the Rome meeting, said without reservation after returning home: This meeting was a major failure.
    Because the Rome meeting failed to reach an agreement on the issue of a European army with the participation of West German troops, US radio commentator Schwin said anxiously during the Rome meeting: "Germany (referring to West Germany)'s joining the Western family of nations (referring to the North Atlantic Aggression Group) is still a distant prospect." An Associated Press dispatch from Rome on November 28 believed that Britain's refusal to participate in the European army at the Rome meeting had "cast a large shadow over the possibility of realizing the European army plan." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris on November 29 said: This British attitude "has caused some newspapers in Paris to produce pessimistic arguments." Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker stated more clearly: "If we continue like this, the European army will not succeed."
    After the Rome meeting, the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries on the issue of arms expansion have become even more acute. On the eve of the Rome meeting, the "New York Post," a fervent supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty, strongly urged the meeting to resolve the serious economic and political crisis in Western Europe, because "the Western European alliance is teetering. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization... is facing a real crisis of collapse. ... 'Inflation!' This evil is undermining the already unstable economy of our friends (referring to Western European countries), shaking their already weakened monetary credit, and causing deep unease and resentment." However, the Rome meeting completely failed to provide any solutions to all of these problems. Currently, the US economic governor to Western Europe, Harriman, arrived in London on December 3 to urge the British government to accelerate arms expansion, but according to a United Press International dispatch from London: "Churchill and Eden told Harriman that without US economic aid, without US appropriations, Britain cannot complete its own £4.7 billion three-year military expansion plan."
    Thus, the Rome meeting sharply exposed the fact that the North Atlantic Group, which is trying to step up its war preparations, does not actually have the strength to realize its war preparations plan. When British Foreign Secretary Eden reported to the House of Commons on December 3 on the proceedings of the Rome meeting, he had to admit: "The most difficult problem now facing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is how to coordinate the defense (should be read as aggression) requirements of the North Atlantic region with the political and economic capabilities of the countries concerned." Eden publicly warned that the North Atlantic Treaty's arms expansion plan "must be revised" to prevent the economic and political "collapse" of Western Europe.

### 北大西洋侵略集团罗马会议失败后  美在西欧备战更困难  美报惊呼侵略联盟遭到崩溃危机

    北大西洋侵略集团罗马会议失败后
    美在西欧备战更困难
    美报惊呼侵略联盟遭到崩溃危机
    【新华社七日讯】最近在罗马举行的北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议的失败，使得美国在西欧备战的前途更加阴暗，这已是北大西洋各国政府首脑和资产阶级舆论所无法掩饰的事实。据法新社透露，曾在罗马会议中对西欧仆从国家代表用尽一切高压手段的美国国务卿艾奇逊，四日在离意大利返美国前不得不向记者公开承认：“大西洋国家尚未解决它们在共同防御组织内所遭遇的最严重的困难。……还需要重新作更大的努力来解决仍待解决的重要问题。”出席罗马会议的荷兰外交大臣斯蒂克在回国后毫不隐讳地说：这次会议是一个大失败。
    由于罗马会议对组织有西德军队参加的欧洲军问题不能取得协议，美国广播评论员史温在罗马会议期间就焦虑地说：“德国（指西德）加入西方国家大家庭（指北大西洋侵略集团）目前仍是可望而不可即的事。”美联社罗马十一月二十八日电认为英国在罗马会议中拒绝参加欧洲军，已使“欧洲军计划实现的可能性蒙上了很大的阴影”。法新社巴黎十一月二十九日电说：英国这种态度“已经使巴黎的某些报纸产生悲观的论调”。荷兰外交大臣斯蒂克更明白表示：“假如我们像这样干下去，欧洲军将不会成功。”
    罗马会议以后，美国和西欧国家间在扩军问题上的矛盾已更形尖锐。在罗马会议前夕，狂热地拥护北大西洋公约的“纽约邮报”曾力促会议必须解决西欧严重的经济政治危机，因为“西欧的联盟正在摇摇欲倒。北大西洋公约组织……正遭到真正崩溃的危机。……‘通货膨胀！’这个恶魔正在破坏我们的朋友（指西欧国家）的已经动荡不定的经济，正在动摇它们已经削弱的货币信用，并正在引起深刻的不安和怨愤。”但是罗马会议却完全没有能对所有这一切的问题提出任何解决办法。目前，美国驻西欧的经济总督哈里曼已在十二月三日到伦敦催促英国政府加速扩军，但是据合众社伦敦电透露：“邱吉尔和艾登曾经告诉哈里曼说：没有美国经济援助，没有美国的拨款，英国就不能完成它自己的四十七亿英镑的三年扩张军备计划。”
    这样，罗马会议就尖锐地暴露了力图加紧推行其备战计划的北大西洋集团实际上并没有实现其备战计划的力量。英国外交大臣艾登十二月三日向下院报告罗马会议经过时，不得不承认：“现在面对着北大西洋公约组织的最困难的问题，是北大西洋地区的防务（应读为侵略）要求和有关国家的政治和经济能力如何协调的问题。”艾登公开警告北大西洋公约的扩军计划“必须加以修正”，以防西欧的经济和政治“趋于崩溃”。
