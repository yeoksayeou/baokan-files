The employees of the China National Department Store Southwest District Company are participating in the patriotic production increase and thrift competition proposed by the employees of the China National Department Store Northwest District Company, and are issuing the following challenges to the China National Department Stores in major cities across the country: 1. Guarantee that the national department store organizations in the entire district will save a total of 27.7 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter of this year. 2. Master the fourteen major commodities in the thirty-four large and medium-sized cities in the Southwest District and vigorously promote sales. Strive to sell 80 percent of winter goods by the end of December, and increase the capital turnover rate in the fourth quarter of this year by 40 percent compared to the third quarter. 3. Focus on calculating the production costs of guaranteed sales commodities. 4. Strengthen political and professional studies, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, and implement ideological education on "increasing production and practicing thrift, opposing corruption and waste." 5. Guarantee the completion of asset inventory work before December 10 and complete the year-end final accounts ahead of schedule. 6. Implement direct transportation for material storage and transportation, ensure timely allocation, achieve "fast loading, fast transportation, fast unloading," and good packaging, low losses, and low costs. 7. Do a good job in security work to ensure that people's property is not lost.

In October of this year, the China National Department Store Southwest District Company launched a patriotic labor emulation drive, and employees proposed many ways to improve business management and save expenses. The company's storage and transportation department established a goods pick-up team and adopted the "pick up goods alongside the ship" method: before cargo ships from various places arrived, they prepared warehouse capacity and lighterage tools, and as soon as the cargo ships arrived, they directly transported the goods to the warehouse or transferred them to various places. In twenty days of November, it had already saved more than 5 million yuan in repeated pick-up and unloading fees. At the same time, because the transfer procedures were simplified, the phenomenon of goods often being piled up on the riverbank in the past has been eliminated. In terms of transportation, due to the strengthening of connections between branches in various places, attention was paid to organizing return cargo sources, saving more than 50 million yuan in automobile return empty subsidies in November. In the past, brown ropes were used to package sugar in Neijiang, southern Sichuan, but now bamboo ropes are used, which can save 300 million yuan throughout the year. In the past, there were large losses when storing sugar in various places, but after changing to separate stacking and storage, the loss rate in November was reduced by 2 percent compared with the past. Due to the above efforts, the storage and transportation department of the company has completed 50 percent of its fourth-quarter savings plan in November alone.

The battle conditions put forward by the employees of the China National Department Store Southwest District Company this time have been fully deliberated and discussed by the trade union member groups in advance, and passed by the general meeting of all employees held on December 4. All departments have generally revised their contact contracts and included savings plans in patriotic covenants.

Xinhua News Agency: The entire staff and workers of the Shanghai Municipal Company of the State-run China Department Store have decided to participate in the patriotic production increase and frugality competition proposed by the staff and workers of the Northwest District Company of the China Department Store. Their conditions for participating in the competition are as follows: 1. Ensure the completion of the fourth quarter sales task (the fourth quarter task is 88 percent higher than the actual sales volume in the third quarter), and vigorously promote sales by checking warehouses, queuing goods, and clearing slow-moving goods to accelerate capital turnover. The fourth quarter capital turnover should be reduced from 82 days in the third quarter to 67 days. 2. Practice strict economy, avoid extravagance and waste, and reduce the commodity circulation cost in the fourth quarter from the original quota of 3.87 percent to 3.42 percent. At the same time, it is necessary to improve labor efficiency, improve working methods, and expand sales volume. In the fourth quarter, the expenditure on wages and subsidized wages should account for 0.43 percent of the commodity circulation volume, which is 0.27 percent lower than the average proportion in the first three quarters of this year. 3. Conscientiously do a good job in clearing assets and verifying funds, ensuring that the valuation is correct, the property is real, and the accounts and goods match, and do a good job in the final accounts in advance. 4. Ensure that the Spring Festival supplies are well prepared. The above conditions have been discussed and approved by all trade union groups, and each trade union group has formulated specific plans to ensure the completion of the above conditions based on the business situation of its department.
