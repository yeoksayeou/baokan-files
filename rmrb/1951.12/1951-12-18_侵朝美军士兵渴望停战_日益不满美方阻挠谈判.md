Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Despite Ridgway and Van Fleet's best efforts to deceive their soldiers, U.S. soldiers are increasingly aware that the U.S. government is obstructing armistice negotiations. "New York Times" reporter Barrett, in a report from the Korean front on November 11th, admitted: "Recent developments in the Korean armistice negotiations at Panmunjom have led some troops on the front lines to believe that their own commanders are obstructing an agreement for reasons unknown to the troops."

Barrett summarized his impressions from interviews with several U.S. military units on the front lines: "In most 'chats,' whether in conversations at generals' tables or in roadside banter among the troops, one often hears questions like: 'Why are we unwilling to stop fighting now?'" Barrett said: "It seems that more and more of them [referring to U.S. soldiers] hold a naive view of the current situation, believing that the Communists have made significant concessions, while in their view, the United Nations forces are constantly making more and more demands."

In his report, Barrett admitted that the U.S. negotiators' tricks only made it clearer that the Korean and Chinese sides were working for peace, while the "United Nations forces" were playing a "war" role. He said: "In most cases, the United Nations armistice representatives give the impression that whenever the Communists express willingness to comply with their demands, they change their demands."

It is precisely because of this that U.S. soldiers, eager for an armistice, are becoming increasingly tired of the war. "Newsweek," one of the major U.S. business magazines, published an article on November 19th specifically describing the plight of U.S. soldiers in Korea. When discussing the morale of the soldiers, the article said: "Rotation is the number one topic, even surpassing 'the girl back home.' This spring, the average G.I. felt he was fighting a real war for a real purpose; now, he only feels that his day to return home is coming too slowly. He is confused by the armistice negotiations. He is bothered by a future that may be empty and meaningless." The article used a soldier's complaint: "They're negotiating peace, so why the hell are we still fighting? They tell us this is a global war to stop communism, and that by staying here, we are contributing. But we want to know: what will become of us if this goes on?" The article admitted: "If a ceasefire is achieved, then everything will be fine. Otherwise, the morale problem could become serious."

    侵朝美军士兵渴望停战
    日益不满美方阻挠谈判
    【新华社十六日讯】尽管李奇微、范佛里特竭力欺骗他们的士兵，但是美军士兵们已愈来愈清楚地认识是美国政府在阻挠停战谈判。“纽约时报”记者巴瑞特上月十一日发自朝鲜前线的报道承认：“在板门店举行的朝鲜停战谈判的最近的发展，使战线上的一些部队相信，他们自己的指挥官为了一种部队所不知道的理由正在阻挠协议。”
    巴瑞特综述他在前线上几支美军部队中采访时所得的印象说：“在大多数‘聊天’中，不论是将军们餐桌中的谈话也好，军队在路旁的拌嘴也好，常常可以听到有人提出这样的问题：‘为什么我们不愿在现在停火呢？’”巴瑞特说：“他们（指美军）中间似乎有愈来愈多的人对目前局势抱有一种天真的看法，认为共方已作了重大的让步，而在他们看来，联合国军却不断提出愈来愈多的要求。”
    巴瑞特在报道中承认美方谈判代表耍弄种种花样的结果，只是使人们更加清楚地看到朝中方面为和平而努力，而“联合国军却扮演‘战争’的角色”。他说：“在大多数场合，联合国军休战代表总是给人们这样的一种印象：每当共方表示愿意顺从他们的主张时，他们就改变主张。”
    正因为如此，渴望停战的美军士兵对于战争也愈来愈厌烦。美国大企业的杂志之一“新闻周刊”在上月十九日曾发表一篇文章，专门描写在朝鲜美军士兵的困顿情形。这篇文章在谈到士兵们的情绪时说：“轮换是头号话题，甚至超过‘家里的女郎’。今年春天时，普通的美国大兵感到他是在为真正的目的打真正的仗，现在他只嫌轮到他回家的日子来得太慢。他被休战谈判搞迷糊了。对于可能是空虚的、无意义的前途，他感到烦恼。”这篇文章用士兵的责难说：“他们在谈判和平的时候，他妈的，我们为什么还在打仗呢？他们告诉我们说，这是制止共产主义的一个全球战争，我们只要在这里守着，就是作了贡献。但是我们要知道：这样下去我们到底怎么样？”这篇文章承认：“如果停火实现，那就万事大吉。不然的话，士气的问题可能严重起来。”
