Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 25th. The East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the various units under the Third Field Army have enthusiastically launched the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. All commanders and fighters in the units have studied the current situation and tasks, and clearly recognize the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy for winning the final victory in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and building the motherland. During the study, everyone examined the phenomena of waste in themselves and their units. Some units also carried out traditional education of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, deeply examined the hedonistic thoughts of some comrades, and further clarified to commanders and fighters that integrity and selflessness, hard work and plain living are the noble qualities that people's soldiers should possess. On this basis, each unit and each individual has formulated a savings plan. For example, Zhang Aiping, Commander of the Zhejiang Military Region, specifically stipulated in his plan to save water and electricity, reduce dormitory rooms, etc.
　　After formulating the plans, all units were able to strictly implement them, saving a large amount of wealth for the country. The Logistics Department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army saved more than 6 million yuan in special expenditure fees in November. The Political Department of the Shandong Military Region cleared out materials worth more than 12 million yuan in the increase production and practice economy movement. A motor vehicle driving class of a certain unit saved 6 million yuan in vehicle repair costs and 200 gallons of gasoline in one month. In order to eliminate the waste of grain and grass, some units held training courses for cooks. A certain unit universally changed coal-burning stoves to chaff-burning stoves, so that each company could save about 1 million yuan worth of firewood and grass per month. Some soldiers saved their allowances and deposited them in the local People's Bank of China. They said, "By accumulating small amounts, the country can quickly use these funds for construction." Many soldiers took the initiative to write letters encouraging their families to work hard in production, practice strict economy, and respond to Chairman Mao's call.

    华东军区和三野各部展开增产节约运动
    各单位正严格执行节约计划为国家节省大量财富
    【新华社南京二十五日电】中国人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军所属各部队热烈展开了增产节约运动。各部队的全体指挥员和战斗员由于进行了目前形势与任务的学习，明确认识了增产节约对争取抗美援朝的最后胜利和建设祖国的伟大意义。在学习中，每个人都检查了自己和本单位的浪费现象。有的单位并同时进行中国人民解放军的传统教育，深入检查了某些同志的享乐思想，更进一步地使指挥员和战斗员明确认识到廉洁奉公、艰苦朴素是人民战士应有的高贵品质。在这个基础上，每个单位和每个人都订出了节约计划。如浙江军区司令员张爱萍的计划中具体规定了节省水电，减少宿舍的房间等。
    各单位在制订计划后，都能严格执行，为国家节省了大量财富。华东军区和第三野战军后方勤务部在十一月份就节省了特支费六百多万元。山东军区政治部在增产节约运动中就清理出价值人民币一千二百多万元的物资。某部汽车驾驶班一个月就节约汽车修理费六百万元和二百加仑汽油。有的单位为了杜绝粮草的浪费，举办了炊事员训练班。某部并普遍将烧煤锅灶改为烧糠的锅灶，这样每一个连一个月就可节省价值一百万元左右的柴草。有的战士把自己的津贴费节省下来，存入当地的中国人民银行。他们说：“这样积少成多，国家就可以把这些资金很快用到建设事业上去。”很多战士自动写信鼓励家属努力生产，厉行节约，响应毛主席的号召。
