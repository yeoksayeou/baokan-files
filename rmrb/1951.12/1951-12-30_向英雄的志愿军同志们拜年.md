    New Year Greetings to the Heroic Volunteer Army Comrades
    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:
    The New Year is here. We are sending you New Year greetings from a brand-new streamlined train in the motherland, celebrating your great victory. Dear comrades, you have defeated the American imperialists who once oppressed us, and we feel proud and honored. Thanks to your heroic struggle, the people of the motherland are protected from the aggression of American imperialism, allowing us to work and study diligently in the motherland. We will do our best and take practical actions to support you.
    Dear comrades, we are the passenger train conductors, traffic conductors, train attendants, and baggage handlers on the train. All the staff on our train are female comrades. In the great cause of building the motherland, we are determined to manage the trains entrusted to us by the motherland even better. When we encounter difficulties in our work, we remember your spirit of hard struggle on the Korean battlefield, "a mouthful of fried noodles and a mouthful of snow," and your spirit of bravely killing the enemy by climbing onto their tanks. Whenever we think of you, we gain infinite strength to overcome difficulties. Dear comrades, every achievement in our work is inseparable from your victorious struggle to defend the motherland. So far, the train we manage has traveled safely for more than 153,000 kilometers. In order to tell the people of the whole country about your victory, our train has given publicity to more than 233,000 passengers in the past nine months. Since June of this year, each of us has dedicated one working day per month to donate airplanes and cannons. Recently, we are responding to Chairman Mao's call to carry out a campaign to increase production and practice economy to support you.
    We wish you greater victories in annihilating more enemies in the New Year!
                The first group of female attendants in the country, the Beijing Train Section Women's Package Crew

    向英雄的志愿军同志们拜年亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    新年到了。我们在祖国的崭新的流线型火车上向你们拜年，庆贺你们的伟大胜利。亲爱的同志们，你们打败了欺压过我们的美帝国主义，我们感到骄傲和自豪。由于你们的英勇奋斗，保住了祖国人民不受美帝国主义的侵犯，使我们能够在祖国好好地工作和学习，我们要尽最大的努力，用实际行动来支援你们。
    亲爱的同志们，我们是列车上的客运车长、运转车长、列车员和行李员。我们列车上的工作人员都是女同志。在建设祖国的伟大事业中，我们决心把祖国交给我们的列车管理得更好。我们在工作中碰到了困难的时候，就记起了你们在朝鲜战场上“一口炒面一口雪”艰苦奋斗的精神，记起了你们爬上敌人的坦克英勇杀敌的精神。我们一想起你们，就增添了克服困难的无限力量。亲爱的同志们，我们工作中的每一分成绩都是和你们保卫祖国的胜利斗争分不开的。到现在，我们管理的火车已经安全行走了十五万三千多公里。为了把你们的胜利消息告诉全国人民，在最近的九个月中，我们列车向二十三万三千余乘客做了宣传。从今年六月份起，我们每个人每月献出了一个劳动日捐献飞机大炮。最近，我们正在响应毛主席的号召，开展增产节约运动来支援你们。
    祝你们在新的一年歼灭更多的敌人！
                全国第一批女乘务员、北京列车段妇女包乘组
