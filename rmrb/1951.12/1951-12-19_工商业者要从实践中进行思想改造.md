Industrialists and Businessmen Must Transform Their Thinking Through Practice
Zi Yaohua, General Manager of Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank

Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Those who once yearned for other things, some have fallen, some have awakened, and some are changing their minds. Events are developing so fast that many people feel sudden and feel the need to relearn. This mood of people is understandable, and we welcome this kind request for a good attitude of relearning." He also said: "The people's state protects the people. With the people's state, the people have the opportunity to educate and transform themselves in a democratic way on a national scale and on an overall scale, so that they can break away from the influence of internal and external reactionaries (this influence is still very large and will exist for a long time and cannot be eliminated quickly), transform the bad habits and bad ideas they have acquired from the old society, prevent themselves from going the wrong way guided by the reactionaries, and continue to move forward towards a socialist and communist society."

This makes us feel that industrialists and businessmen, who have been mixed up in the dyeing vat of the old society for more than ten or dozens of years, have made no contribution to the revolution, nor have they made any contribution to the people. Under the reactionary rule and oppression of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, they have been tainted with a body of bad ideas and bad habits. Fortunately, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have carried out long-term and arduous struggles to liberate us from reactionary rule. Living and operating in a free world, and using democratic methods to let us carry out self-education and self-transformation, what a happiness, what a kindness, what a rare opportunity! The wheel of revolution is constantly advancing. If we do not make timely efforts to catch up, but only stay behind the car, complaining that the car is moving too fast, or even trying to pull it backwards and drive backwards, then we will only fall behind and even fall into the abyss and be unable to extricate ourselves.

The ideological transformation of industrialists and businessmen is already an urgent issue that cannot be delayed. However, ideological transformation must not be divorced from practice. Ideological transformation divorced from practice will become empty talk. Especially we industrialists and businessmen are different from other strata, and we are implementing our daily practical business all the time. Therefore, we need to learn new knowledge and new policies at any time, and associate with ourselves to fight against old ideas and old habits. Otherwise, learning for the sake of learning will be inconsistent in words and deeds, and we will still make mistakes. Taking the study of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as an example, if we do not link it with reality and study it seriously, it is easy to look at problems in isolation, or even to look at problems only for our own convenience. Not only do we not require ourselves to strictly abide by the Common Program, but we distort the Common Program to satisfy our own selfish desires. For example, in handling public-private relations, for processing, ordering, purchasing, and selling on commission, we emphasize private interests and ignore obedience to the leadership of the state-owned economy, and even develop to the point of only caring about private interests and not caring about public interests, which violates the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. For example, in dealing with labor-capital relations, not only can we not consciously assist the trade union in carrying out its work and solve difficulties for the workers, but we use the old methods to force workers to work and produce, forgetting that the People's Republic of China is led by the working class and that everything must rely on the spirit of the working class to build the country, forgetting that we must implement democratic management in order to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. This, of course, violates the principle of benefiting both labor and capital.

In addition, there are also unfortunate events such as raising prices, hoarding, speculation, shoddy manufacturing, blind competition, tax evasion, etc., that violate the Common Program and continue to occur in major cities. This fully shows that if we do not link our specific actions to carry out self-ideological transformation, it is impossible to do things well.

It is undeniable that in the past two years, due to the great victory of the People's Liberation War, due to the wise leadership of the People's Government, and with the development of the three major patriotic movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, national industrialists and businessmen have indeed taken a step forward in their political understanding. Industrialists and businessmen across the country held unprecedented anti-American demonstrations and parades; they generally formulated practical patriotic covenants; they strived to pay taxes on time and even pay taxes ahead of schedule, and even pay taxes collectively. In addition, various regions have launched vigorous donation campaigns. All these phenomena are very good, but does this mean that all industrialists and businessmen have truly changed their thinking? According to the current actual situation, industrialists and businessmen are still in the initial stage of ideological transformation and have not completely shaken off the bad ideas and bad habits they have acquired from the old society. Their subjective understanding is far behind the development of the objective situation, so they still show hesitation, inconsistency in words and deeds, and contradictions between appearance and reality. If we do not catch up quickly, study Mao Zedong Thought in depth with leadership, planning, and steps, and strive to transform ourselves, it is impossible to consolidate the existing achievements and wholeheartedly serve the people and strive to complete the economic construction of the New Democracy.

Based on my personal learning experience, at the beginning of liberation, I read newspapers carefully from beginning to end every day, and I bought and read Marxist-Leninist books and periodicals as soon as I saw them. But I did not know how to combine theory with practice, let alone relate it to myself. Later, I attended various large and small meetings of great significance in Beijing and Tianjin, listened to the reports of the leaders, and met old progressive friends whom I had not seen for many years. Only then did I feel that my studies were not deep enough and realized that an old intellectual and businessman like me who had been mixed up in the old society for decades had a lot of old baggage on his back and it was not easy to transform. If old ideas are not completely eliminated, they will come out and make trouble unconsciously. And the elimination of these old ideas can never be achieved by a person closing his door and concentrating on self-cultivation without participating in actual revolutionary work. Since participating in the study and discussion meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I have gained more organized and step-by-step self-study and group discussions, which have given me a lot of inspiration and made me realize that I only know my shortcomings after learning. Especially when participating in the revolutionary practice of land reform in Hunan, I personally witnessed the most thorough and greatest change in thousands of years in Chinese history, changing the feudal exploitation of land ownership to peasant land ownership, deeply realizing all the crimes of the landlord class, and deepening my hatred for the landlord class. However, in various patriotic movements, I still cannot connect with the masses well, I still cannot thoroughly achieve unity, and sometimes I still have to take into account face and consider personal feelings. Therefore, I cannot correctly use the methods of criticism and self-criticism, cannot face the truth, let alone grasp the truth. As Chairman Mao said in "Strategic Issues in China's Revolutionary War": "Learning is not easy, and using it is even more difficult." When I participated in the study movement, I reread Chairman Mao's "Combat Liberalism" and compared it with myself. I felt that I had a share in almost every article. Only by using this article as a big mirror and comparing it with actual actions every day can I easily see all my problems. Therefore, if you want to transform yourself, you must proceed from practice and from specific issues. Only by learning in the process of practice can you seek true self-transformation. Only by carrying out self-transformation in actual actions can you abandon what you liked and became accustomed to in the past, and accept what you originally disliked and were not accustomed to; change what you originally liked and became accustomed to into dislike and unaccustomed; and change what you originally disliked and unaccustomed to into like and accustomed to. Industrialists and businessmen must completely eliminate the ideas brought about by the old society and resolutely fight for the cause of the people.

### 工商业者要从实践中进行思想改造

    工商业者要从实践中进行思想改造
    上海商业储蓄银行总经理  资耀华
    毛主席在“论人民民主专政”里说：“曾经留恋过别的东西的人们，有些倒下去了，有些觉悟过来了，有些正在换脑筋。事变是发展得这样快，以至使很多人感到突然，感到要重新学习。人们的这种心情是可以理解的，我们欢迎这种善良的要求重新学习的态度。”又说：“人民的国家是保护人民的。有了人民的国家，人民才有可能，在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展。”
    这使我们感觉到：在那个旧社会染缸里混了十几年或几十年的工商业者，对革命既毫无功劳，对人民又毫无贡献，在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义反动统治和压迫下，染了一身的坏思想和坏习惯。幸经中国共产党、人民解放军长期艰苦斗争，使我们从反动统治下解放出来。在自由的天地中生活着、经营着，并用民主的方法来让我们进行自我教育和自我改造，这是何等的幸福，何等的亲切，何等难得的机会！革命的车轮是不断向前进展的，若不及时努力赶上，只是停留在车子后面，怨恨车子走得太快，甚至企图把它向后拉，开倒车，那就只有掉队落伍，甚至落入深渊而不能自拔了。
    工商业家的思想改造，已经是一个迫切而不容稍缓的问题。然而思想改造，决不能脱离实践。脱离实践的思想改造，就会流为空谈。尤其是我们工商业者更不同于其他各阶层，时时刻刻在执行自己的日常实际业务，因此须要随时学习新知识和新政策，联系自己，以和旧思想旧习惯作斗争。否则为学习而学习，就会表里不一、言行不一，依然要犯错误。以学习人民政协共同纲领为例，若不联系实际，认真学习，就容易孤立看问题，甚至仅为自己的方便来看问题，不但不要求自己严格遵守共同纲领，反而会歪曲共同纲领，来满足自己的私欲。例如在处理公私关系上，对于加工、定货、代购、代销等，就强调私人利益，忽略服从国营经济的领导，甚至发展到只顾私而不顾公，结果违背公私兼顾的原则。又如在处理劳资关系上，不但不能自觉地协助工会进行工作，多替职工解决困难，反而使用老一套的方法，强迫工人劳动生产，忘记了中华人民共和国是以工人阶级为领导，一切要依靠工人阶级这个建国的精神，忘记了必须实行管理民主化，才能发扬职工群众的积极性、创造性，这当然就违背了劳资两利原则。
    此外尚有哄抬物价、囤积居奇、投机取巧、粗制滥造、盲目竞争、逃税漏税等等违反共同纲领的不幸事件，在各大城市中不断地发生，这就充分说明了若不联系自己的具体行动，以进行自我思想改造，那就不可能把事情作好的。
    无可讳言，两年来由于人民解放战争的伟大胜利，由于人民政府的贤明领导，再加以抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大爱国运动的开展，民族工商业者确已在政治认识上提高了一步。全国工商业者举行了空前的反美示威大游行；普遍地制订了切合实际的爱国公约；争取由如期纳税而提前纳税，由提前纳税而集体纳税。另外，各地区又展开了轰轰烈烈的捐献运动。所有这些现象都是很好的，但这是否说明所有工商业者在思想上都真正转变过来了呢？根据目前的实际情况来说，工商业者还是停留在思想转变的初期，还没有完全摆脱从旧社会得来的那些坏思想坏习惯，主观认识还远远落在客观形势发展的后面，因此处处还表现出来依违两可、言行不一、表里矛盾等现象。若不急起直追，有领导、有计划、有步骤地深入学习毛泽东思想，努力改造自己，就不可能巩固既有的成绩，全心全意为人民服务，为完成新民主主义的经济建设而努力。
    就我个人学习的经验来说，在解放之初，每天都从头到尾用心阅读报纸，见了马列主义的书刊也是随买随读。但不知结合实际，更谈不到联系自己。后来在北京、天津参加了各种大小有重大意义的会，听了首长的报告，遇见了多年不见的进步的老朋友，才感到学习不够深入，认识到像我这样一个在旧社会里混了几十年的旧知识分子兼工商业者，旧的包袱背了一大堆，不是容易改造过来的。旧的思想若不彻底铲除，就会不知不觉地出来作祟。而这些旧思想的铲除，也决不是一个人闭户潜修而不参加实际革命工作所能做得到的。自从参加了人民政协全国委员会学习座谈会，获得了比较有次序、有步骤的自学和小组讨论，才得到了不少启发，认识到学然后知不足。尤其是在参加湖南土地改革这个革命实践中，亲眼看见了中国历史上几千年一次最彻底最伟大的变革，把封建剥削的土地所有制改变为农民的土地所有制，深刻地认识了地主阶级的一切罪恶，加深了对于地主阶级的痛恨。但是在各种爱国运动中，还不能好好地联系群众，还不能彻底地搞好团结，有时还要顾忌面子，还要考虑私人情感。因此就不能正确地运用批评和自我批评的方法，不能面对真理，更谈不上掌握真理。诚如毛主席在“中国革命战争的战略问题”上所说：“学习不是容易的事情，使用更加不容易。”当我参加学习运动的时候，曾重读了毛主席的“反对自由主义”，和自己对照，感到差不多每一条都有我一份。只有把这文章当一面大镜子，每天都在实际行动中加以对照，才容易看出自己的一切毛病。所以要想自我改造，就须从实践中，从具体问题上进行。也只有在实践过程中学习，才能求得真正的自我改造。只有在实际行动上进行自我改造，才能抛弃过去所喜欢和已成习惯的东西，而接受原来不喜欢不习惯的东西；使原来喜欢的和已成习惯的东西，变为不喜欢不习惯；使原来不喜欢不习惯的东西，变为喜欢和习惯的。工商业者必须彻底消灭由旧社会带来的思想，坚决地为人民事业而奋斗。
