    Students of Tianjin China Institute of Mining
    Demand Teachers Seriously Purge Erroneous Thoughts
    Editor: The students of Tianjin China Institute of Mining are very concerned about the teachers' study movement. They help teachers study with practical actions. The students of the Electrical Engineering Department said in a letter to the teachers: "You are the people who directly educate and cultivate us, and your study is closely related to our study. In order to facilitate the teachers' study, we guarantee to concentrate on listening to lectures, strengthen self-study, and reduce the teachers' tutoring time."
    We believe that in this study movement, some teachers have realized the necessity of self-reform and have begun to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to examine themselves. However, some teachers should study further and further criticize themselves.
    The daily teaching work of some teachers is very unsatisfactory. For example, the professor in charge of thermodynamics in the second year of the Mechanical Engineering Department simply copies what is said in the book onto the blackboard without any explanation, regardless of whether the students understand it or not. A professor teaching mechanics in the Electrical Engineering Department only relies on his own subjective experience to teach and cannot meet the requirements of the students. He usually does not accept students' suggestions and criticisms well, and always mixes in English when lecturing, confusing the students. Some professors also have serious mercenary views. Once, students in the Mechanical Engineering Department asked a teacher teaching heat engines to explain an algebraic problem, and the teacher actually said, "I don't earn that millet for this." Many teachers also promote American "material civilization" to students, falsely claiming that "everyone in America has a car... China even copies textbooks from foreign countries." Some teachers use examples from the United States when lecturing. A student from the Coal Mining Department said, "We are not mining coal in the United States, why talk about these things." Some professors do not have a correct understanding of the wisdom of the Chinese working people. A professor teaching surveying said, "Chinese people don't know how to use instruments." With these erroneous thoughts of the professors, our studies are greatly affected. We earnestly hope that the teachers, in the spirit of being responsible to the motherland and the people, will earnestly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and do a good job in this study.

### 天津中国矿业学院学生  要求教师认真清算错误思想

    天津中国矿业学院学生
    要求教师认真清算错误思想
    编辑同志：天津中国矿业学院的同学们，对于教师们的学习运动都是非常关怀的。他们以实际行动帮助老师们学习。电机系同学在写给老师们的信上说：“你们是直接教育培养我们的人，你们的学习与我们的学习是有密切关系的。为了便利老师们学习，我们保证专心听课，加强自学，减少老师的辅导时间。”
    我们觉得，在这次学习运动中，有些教师已经认识了自我改造的必要，开始以批评和自我批评的武器来检查自己。但有些老师还应该深入学习，进一步批判自己。
    某些教师平日的教学工作是很难令人满意的。譬如担任机械系二年级热功学的教授，上课时硬把书上所说的那一套原封不动地搬上黑板，完全没有讲解，不管同学听懂听不懂。电机系一位教力学的教授，只凭自己的主观经验来教学，不能切合同学的要求。他平时不能很好地接受同学们的建议和批评，讲课时总是夹杂着英语，把同学弄得模模糊糊。有些教授还存在着严重的雇佣观点，机械系同学有一次请一位教热机的老师讲解一个代数题，这位老师竟说：“我又没有挣这份小米。”还有很多老师向同学们宣扬美国的“物质文明”，瞎说“美国每个人都有汽车……中国连教科书都是从外国抄袭来的。”有些老师讲课时举出的例子都是美国的。采煤系的一位同学说：“我们又不到美国采煤，干么讲这些。”某些教授对中国劳动人民的智慧还没有正确的认识，一位教测量的教授说：“中国人不会使用仪器。”教授们有了这些错误思想，我们的学习就受到很大的影响。我们热切地希望教师们本着为祖国为人民负责的精神，切实地掌握批评和自我批评的武器，把这次学习搞好。
