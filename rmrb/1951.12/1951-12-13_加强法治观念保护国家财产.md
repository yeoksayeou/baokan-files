Strengthen the Concept of the Rule of Law to Protect State Property
Lan Gongwu, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate

The case of Qiao Mingxun, Chairman of the Tianjin Rubber Trade Association, and Li Bingjia, a private rubber manufacturer, who defrauded the state of 8 billion yuan in state property through various fraudulent means in the processing of military raincoats for the state, has been prosecuted by the Tianjin People's Procuratorate and judged by the Tianjin People's Court according to law. We believe this judgment is entirely necessary and appropriate.

In cities across the country, many cases of unscrupulous merchants defrauding state property have occurred. From January to July of this year, people's courts at all levels in Hunan Province handled 3,082 cases. In the first half of this year, the 21 such cases handled by the Beijing People's Court resulted in a loss of more than 1.9 billion yuan in state property. This is a serious problem. Since liberation, through the education of resisting America and aiding Korea, and through the adjustment of industry and commerce, the patriotic ideology and the concept of cherishing public property of the industrial and commercial circles have been significantly improved, and they have made considerable contributions to increasing production and patriotic donations. However, on the other hand, some industrialists and businessmen still follow the old ways of doing business and bad habits, engaging in speculation and profiteering, skimping on materials, and buying and selling short, using various methods to defraud state property, and lacking the public virtue of loving the country and cherishing public property that the people of the new China should have. If these illegal acts are not given due punishment, it will not be possible to effectively protect state property and the interests of the people, nor will it be possible to consolidate the economic order. Therefore, it is extremely important to impose legal sanctions on unscrupulous merchants who dare to infringe on state property. Only in this way can we maintain the seriousness of the law and discipline, and warn unscrupulous merchants to be fearful.

However, some staff members of state organs do not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness and importance of this issue, and their handling of the issue is not serious either. On the one hand, some cadres are careless and do not conduct investigations and research when entrusting merchants to process orders and transport materials, thus being deceived by unscrupulous merchants. For example, the personnel of the organs involved in the raincoat case did not investigate and study the existence of three-roller machines in each manufacturer, as well as the amount of gasoline consumption, and did not calculate carefully. Instead, they unconditionally trusted the unscrupulous merchants and hastily signed contracts, setting the standard for gasoline consumption per bolt of cloth at 4.5 gallons, when it should have been about one gallon, resulting in a loss of 3 billion yuan in state property in gasoline alone. This is the subjective reason why many fraud cases occur. On the other hand, some cadres lack a clear legal perspective, or regard such cases as unimportant, and adopt an indifferent attitude, thus accommodating, condoning, and tolerating the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants. For example, some people believe that the purpose of merchants is to make money, the morality of merchants is to deceive, and defrauding state property is not a crime. This understanding is obviously wrong. The Common Program stipulates that the five economic components should cooperate and each play its part; at the same time, it stipulates that "speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly prohibited." (Article 37) This means protecting reasonable business operations and legitimate profits, and opposing illegal business operations and defrauding exorbitant profits. Article 8 of the Common Program stipulates that cherishing public property is the duty of citizens of the People's Republic of China. Infringing on state property is a violation of the citizens' duty. In particular, state property is the property of the public, and no one is allowed to steal or defraud it. Furthermore, some people hold the view that "contracts are sacred," believing that once a contract is signed, regardless of whether it is reasonable or not, or whether state property is lost, it must be protected and fulfilled, otherwise it will be a violation of the contract system. This understanding is very wrong. If one party to a contract engages in fraudulent behavior, the contract is invalid, that is, one party is violating the contract, and its illegal fraudulent behavior must be severely punished. In the raincoat case, the Tianjin People's Court's judgment to revoke the unreasonable gasoline consumption standard portion of the contract is completely correct. It is wrong for some people's courts to handle such cases as civil cases, only recovering the losses and not imposing criminal penalties. Due to the above-mentioned vagueness in understanding and the lack of seriousness in handling, unscrupulous merchants have become even more brazen, saying: "At most, I'll pay compensation, anyway, I can't be convicted." Of course, in handling each specific case, it is necessary to be very cautious, distinguish whether it is illegal and the degree of illegality, and the handling should be very appropriate, fair and reasonable, in order to play an educational role. The raincoat case is a relatively major and typical case, which gives us many experiences and lessons. It is very necessary to study these experiences and lessons among government cadres and industrial and commercial circles in order to improve thinking, improve work, and strengthen the concept of cherishing state property.

    加强法治观念保护国家财产
    最高人民检察署副检察长  蓝公武
    天津市橡胶同业公会主任委员乔铭勋、私营橡胶厂商李炳甲在国家军用雨衣加工中，以种种欺骗手段诈取国家财产八十亿元的案件，经天津市人民检察署检举起诉，已由天津市人民法院依法判决。我们认为这个判决是十分必要和恰当的。
    在全国各城市中，奸商诈骗国家财产的案件已发生过很多。湖南省各级人民法院从今年一月至七月就处理了三千零八十二件。北京市人民法院今年上半年处理的二十一件这类案件，使国家财产损失达十九亿元以上。这是一个严重问题。在解放以后，经过抗美援朝教育、经过调整工商业，工商界爱国思想、爱护公共财物的思想有显著的提高，对于增加生产爱国捐献是有相当贡献的。但另一方面，有些工商业者仍然沿袭旧的经营方式与恶习，投机倒把、偷工减料、买空卖空，以种种方法骗取国家财产，缺乏新中国人民应有的爱国家、爱护公共财物的公德。对于这些违法行为，如不给以应有的惩罚，就不能有效地保护国家财产与人民利益，就不能巩固经济秩序。故对于胆敢侵害国家财产的奸商施以法律制裁，是极其重要的。如此方足以严肃法纪，警戒奸商使有所畏惧。
    但是有些国家机关工作人员对于这个问题的严重性和重要性认识是不够的，对问题的处理也不严肃。一方面，有些干部在委托商人加工定货承运物资当中，粗枝大叶、不调查研究，致为奸商所欺骗。如与雨衣案有关的机关人员，对于各承制厂有无三联滚机设备，以及汽油消耗量的大小等都不调查研究，细密计算，而无原则地信赖奸商草率订约，将每匹布一加仑左右的汽油消耗标准订为四点五加仑，仅汽油一项即损失国家财产三十亿元之巨。这是许多被骗案所以发生的主观原因。另一方面，有些干部缺乏明确的法治观点，或者对这类案件视为无关重要，采取漠不关心的态度，以致迁就、姑息、纵容奸商的不法活动。如有人认为商人的目的就是赚钱，商人的道德就是欺骗，诈取国家财产不算犯法。这种认识显然是错误的。共同纲领规定五种经济成份分工合作各得其所；同时又规定“对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔。”（第三十七条）这就是说保护合理的经营与正当利润，反对非法经营与诈取暴利。共同纲领第八条规定爱护公共财产为中华人民共和国国民的义务。侵害国家财产，就是违背国民的义务，尤其国家财产是社会公有的财产，更不容许任何人进行窃盗和诈取。又有些人抱着“合同神圣”的观点，认为合同一经签订，不管合理与否，国家财产是否遭到损失，都要保护，都要履行，否则便是破坏合同制。这种认识是非常错误的。签订合同的双方如一方有欺诈行为，合同即便失效，即是一方破坏合同，对于其非法欺诈行为必须予以严厉制裁。在雨衣案中，天津市人民法院判决撤销合同中不合理的汽油消耗标准部分，是完全正确的。有的人民法院将这类案件作民事处理，只追回损失，不科处刑罚是不对的。由于上述认识上的模糊和处理的不严肃，使不法奸商益形放肆地说：“充其量赔款，反正不能判我的罪。”当然在处理每一个具体案件中，应该十分慎重，区别其是否违法和违法的程度，处理要十分恰当公正合理，才能发挥教育作用。雨衣案是一个较为重大和典型的案件，给予我们许多经验教训。在政府干部和工商界中学习这些经验教训借以提高思想改进工作，并加强爱护国家财产的观念，是十分必要的。
