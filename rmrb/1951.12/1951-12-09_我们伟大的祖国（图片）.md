    Our Great Motherland
    Today is the 16th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the "December 9th" Movement not only set off a climax of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese national salvation movement, but also educated the vast number of patriotic young intellectuals, enabling them to embark on the road of revolutionary armed struggle and closely integrate with workers, peasants and soldiers. This is a scene of Beijing students promoting the movement on the streets during the "December 9th" Movement.
