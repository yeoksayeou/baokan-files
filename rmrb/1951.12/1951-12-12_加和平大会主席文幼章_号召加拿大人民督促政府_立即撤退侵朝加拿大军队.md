Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 9th:  According to a dispatch from TASS, in light of the Korean armistice negotiations reaching an agreement on the military demarcation line, Dr. James Endicott, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, called on the Canadian people to demand that the government withdraw Canadian soldiers in Korea before Christmas. Endicott said, "We should not allow any delays in the Korean negotiations; any delay will expose our children to many more days of the danger of death. We should enable them to leave the front line before Christmas."

Endicott also pointed out that the arms expansion movement and war should be replaced by disarmament and negotiations. He said, "Great power negotiations can save peace, can save our children—preventing them from becoming murderers and allowing all Canadian youth to live healthy and upright lives, becoming honest and sincere people."

Endicott called on all Canadian people to enthusiastically participate in the peace mission scheduled for December 10th to go to Ottawa, the capital, to request the government to propose a five-power conference to conclude a peace pact. He said, "I ask the youth, parents, veterans, workers, farmers, and businessmen of Canada—all who wish to see Canada prosper in peace—to participate in the peace mission to Ottawa on December 10th… We ask the government to propose a five-power conference to discuss the conclusion of a peace pact."

    号召加拿大人民督促政府
    立即撤退侵朝加拿大军队
    【新华社九日讯】据电通社布拉格讯：鉴于朝鲜停战谈判已就军事分界线问题获致协议，加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士号召加拿大人民要求政府把在朝鲜的加拿大士兵在圣诞节前撤退回国。文幼章说：“我们不应当让朝鲜谈判中发生任何拖延，任何拖延都会使我们的孩子多担受许多天的死亡危险。我们应当使他们能在圣诞节前离开前线。
    文幼章还指出，扩张军备运动与战争应该用裁减军备与谈判来代替。他说：“大国谈判可以挽救和平，可以挽救我们的孩子——不让他们成为杀人犯，让所有加拿大青年都能过身心健康的生活，成为正直而诚实的人。”
    文幼章号召加拿大全体人民热烈参加定于十二月十日前往首都渥太华要求政府建议五大国举行会议以缔结和平公约的和平使团，他说：“我要求加拿大的青年、父母、退伍军人、工人、农民和商人——所有希望看到加拿大在和平中繁荣起来的人们，参加十二月十日赴渥太华的和平使团……我们要求政府建议五大国举行会议，讨论缔结和平公约。”
