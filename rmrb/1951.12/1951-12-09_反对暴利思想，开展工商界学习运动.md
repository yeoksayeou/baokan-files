Recently, private industrial and commercial circles in cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing have been engaged in a broad study movement. This is an important step for patriotic industrialists and businessmen to raise their political consciousness, transform their thinking, and thereby improve their business operations to suit the economic development of the New Democratic society. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, patriotic industrialists and businessmen showed good performance. They have made considerable achievements in donating weapons, paying national taxes, completing national processing orders, and improving business management. This is welcome. However, it should be pointed out that many industrialists and businessmen, in the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement and national construction work, are watching the situation, looking for loopholes, and racking their brains to find ways to seek illegal profiteering. Because they do not consider the interests of the country and the people, but greedily pursue their own self-interest, the result is that the national economic work has increased many difficulties. This is intolerable.

The profiteering mentality of these industrialists and businessmen is mainly manifested in violating the provisions of the Common Program, evading the leadership of the national economy and national planning, pursuing excessive profits, and creating chaos in the social economy. When they had operational difficulties, private industrialists and businessmen relied on the help of the national economy to tide over the difficulties; now that the situation has improved, they refuse to process orders for the state, or reduce quality, calculate high costs, and damage national interests. Secondly, they take advantage of the country and the people's urgent need for certain materials to hoard goods and refuse to sell them, raise prices, form black markets, disrupt the market, and create difficulties for national economic construction, national defense construction, and the supply of people's livelihood materials. Furthermore, they violate government decrees, evade taxes and engage in smuggling, and engage in illegal transactions; they even win over and buy off cadres in state organs with low awareness of financial and economic work and procurement personnel, defraud state property, and corrupt the thinking of revolutionary cadres.

In order to transform the thinking of the business community, it is very necessary to launch a study movement in the business community. In order to make the study movement more in-depth, some industrialists and businessmen must overcome the phenomenon of not caring about learning and not caring about ideological transformation. Some people think that they run factories and do business, and there is no need to study and transform their thinking, so they regard participating in learning as a burden. This view is obviously wrong. If one lacks a correct understanding of the country's economic policies and one's own future, it is unimaginable to do a good job in one's own business. In order to make the study more in-depth, industrialists and businessmen should use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, dispel concerns, and boldly and truthfully expose all profiteering thoughts; only in this way can we eliminate old styles and old habits and achieve the goal of transforming ourselves and improving management.

As everyone knows, thanks to the people's government's vigorous adjustment of industry and commerce and the development of urban and rural material exchanges; thanks to the implementation of land reform in most parts of the country, agricultural production and farmers' purchasing power have increased, and a prosperous scene of "the off-season is not weak, and the peak season is even more prosperous" has emerged throughout the country. With the development of economic construction, the development prospects of China's industry and commerce are exceptionally bright. Industrialists and businessmen should seek their own development from the country's prosperity and development, and should combine personal interests with national interests, and should not seek their own development regardless of national interests or damage to national interests. Patriotic industrialists and businessmen should strive to participate in learning, improve their patriotic thinking, transform themselves, and oppose the mentality of profiteering. This is beneficial to the country and also beneficial to the industrialists and businessmen themselves.

### 反对暴利思想，开展工商界学习运动

    反对暴利思想，开展工商界学习运动
    最近以来，上海、天津、北京等城市的私营工商业界，正在进行一个广泛的学习运动。这是爱国的工商业者提高自己政治觉悟，改造思想，从而改善自己的企业经营，使之适合新民主主义社会经济发展的一个重要的步骤。在抗美援朝运动中，爱国的工商业者有过很好的表现。他们在捐献武器、缴纳国税、完成国家加工订货任务以及改进经营管理等方面，都作出了不少成绩。这是值得欢迎的。但是，应该指出：也有不少工商业者，在伟大的抗美援朝运动和国家建设工作中，却在那里看风头，瞅空子，挖空心思地来想方设法谋取非法暴利。由于他们不考虑国家和人民的利益，而贪婪地追求私利，结果使国家经济工作增加不少困难。这是令人不能容忍的。
    这些工商业者的暴利思想，主要的表现在违反共同纲领的规定，逃避国家经济和国家计划的领导，追求暴利，造成社会经济的混乱。在经营困难的时候，私营工商业者曾经依靠国家经济的帮助，渡过了难关；现在情况好转了，他们就拒绝给国家进行加工订货，或者降低质量，高算成本，损害国家利益。其次，他们乘国家和人民急需某种物资时，囤货拒售，抬高价格，形成黑市，扰乱市场，给国家经济建设、国防建设以及人民生活资料的供应制造困难。再其次，就是违反政府的法令，逃税走私，进行非法交易；甚至拉拢、收买国家机关觉悟不高的财经工作干部及采购人员，骗取国家财产，腐蚀革命干部的思想。
    为了改造工商界的思想，开展工商界的学习运动是十分必要的。为使学习运动能够深入进行，某些工商业者必须克服不关心学习和不关心思想改造的现象。有些人认为自己开工厂、做买卖，没有必要学习和改造思想，因而他们把参加学习看成负担。这种看法，显然是错误的。如果对于国家的经济政策，对于自己的前途，缺乏正确的认识，要想搞好自己的业务那是不可想像的。为使学习能够深入进行，工商业者应该运用批评和自我批评的武器，解除顾虑，大胆地真实地揭露一切暴利思想；唯有如此，才能够革除旧作风和旧习惯，达到改造自己，改善经营的目的。
    大家知道，由于人民政府大力调整工商业，开展了城乡物资交流；由于全国大部地区实行了土地改革，农业生产和农民购买力提高，全国范围已经出现了“淡季不淡，旺季更旺”的繁荣景象。随着经济建设的发展，我国工商业的发展前途是异常光明的。工商业者应该从国家的繁荣发展中来求得自己的发展，要使个人利益与国家利益相结合，而不应该不顾国家利益或损害国家的利益来希图自己的发展。爱国的工商业者应该努力参加学习，提高自己爱国主义的思想，改造自己，反对暴利思想。这对国家是有利的，对工商业者自己也是有利的。
