    The Soviet TASS agency revealed on the 3rd of this month the heinous fact that the US military had dispatched a military transport plane, intruding into the borders of Romania and Hungary, and plotting to drop spies into the Soviet Union and people's democracies to engage in sabotage activities.

    This fact fully proves that the US government is deliberately plotting to create sabotage incidents against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, in an attempt to realize its aggressive ambitions against these countries. It is known that since the end of World War II, the people's democracies have cracked many spy cases, all instigated by the US government behind the scenes. Recently, US President Truman even signed a "Mutual Security Act of 1951," openly stipulating the allocation of funds to subsidize reactionaries to engage in subversive and destructive activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Therefore, this plot of the US military aircraft preparing to drop spies into the Soviet Union and the people's democracies is obviously a planned act of aggression by the US government. The US government cannot shirk its responsibility for this act of aggression.

    At the same time, from this fact, people can also see how shameless and blatant the US government's opposition to the Soviet Union and the people's democracies has become. This is clearly a manifestation of the US government's open hostility towards the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. And at this very moment, the representatives of the US government, at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris, were hypocritically talking about "easing tensions," while directing their Yugoslavian stooge, the Tito government, to put forward the so-called "accusation" case falsely accusing the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of "threatening" Yugoslavia. Now, the US government and its Yugoslavian spies and saboteurs have proved, with their own despicable and vile deeds, how hypocritical the US representatives' empty talk about "easing tensions" is, and how absurd and baseless the accusations of the Yugoslavian Tito government are.

    This criminal act of the US government has crudely violated and undermined the sovereignty of Romania and Hungary, and poses a serious threat to the security of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. This is an act of aggression that cannot be tolerated by the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and by peace-loving people of justice around the world. This will inevitably arouse greater anger among the people of all countries, and they will strive to completely crush all the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism.

### 美国政府的又一无耻侵略活动

    美国政府的又一无耻侵略活动
    塔斯社于本月三日揭露了美国军方派遣军用运输机一架侵入罗马尼亚和匈牙利国境，并阴谋向苏联及人民民主国家境内投下间谍，以从事破坏活动的罪恶事实。
    这一事实充分证明了美国政府是在处心积虑地对苏联及人民民主国家制造破坏事件的阴谋，以图借此实现它对上述国家的侵略野心。人们知道，自第二次世界大战结束以来，各人民民主国家破获了许多间谍案件，都是美国政府在幕后主使的。最近，美国总统杜鲁门并曾签署了一项“一九五一年共同安全法”，公然明文规定拨款资助反动分子，在苏联及人民民主国家内从事颠覆与破坏活动。因此，这次美国军用飞机准备向苏联及人民民主国家投放间谍的阴谋，显然是美国政府有计划的侵略行动。美国政府对这一侵略行动应负的责任是无法推诿的。
    同时，从这一事实里，人们也可以看出：美国政府反对苏联及人民民主国家的活动，已经发展到了如何无耻露骨的程度。这显然是美国政府公开与苏联及人民民主国家为敌的表现。而就在这个时候，美国政府的代表却在巴黎举行的联合国大会上一面妄谈“缓和紧张局势”，一面指使其南斯拉夫走狗铁托政府提出了诬告苏联及人民民主国家“威胁”南斯拉夫的所谓“控诉”案。现在，美国政府及其南斯拉夫的间谍与破坏者以他们自己所做的这种卑鄙下流的事实，证明了美国代表关于“缓和紧张局势”的空谈是如何的虚伪，南斯拉夫铁托政府的诬告是如何的荒诞无稽。
    美国政府的这种罪恶行为，粗暴地侵犯和破坏了罗马尼亚与匈牙利的主权，并对苏联及人民民主国家的安全形成了严重的威胁。这是苏联及人民民主国家的人民和世界爱好正义和平的人士所不能容忍的侵略行为。这就必然要激起各国人民更大的愤怒。为彻底粉碎美国帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋而努力。
