(1) Ma Liu-hai is a coal miner from the Datong Mining Bureau. Under the correct leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, he brought into play the initiative and creativity of the working class, and promoted the production work of the entire Datong Mining Bureau. In September 1950, Ma Liu-hai was honorably elected as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Heroes of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. Starting in June of this year, in order to respond to the call to carry out the patriotic production increase competition movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, Ma Liu-hai has continuously created the highest national coal mine tunneling record.

(2) Under the constant education and enlightenment of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, Ma Liu-hai deeply felt the glory and happiness of the working class in New China. In order to love his great motherland, he brought into play his high level of creative intelligence, first implemented the "multi-heading tunneling cycle operation method," and continuously created new national coal mine tunneling records, accumulating huge wealth for the country. This is a scene of the cadre of the Datong Mining Bureau Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party talking with Ma Liu-hai.

(3) Starting in April 1950, the Datong Mining Bureau launched a production competition movement. In order to implement the new quota management, the slow tunneling efficiency was increased to 50 centimeters. At that time, the workers thought it was very difficult; however, after careful planning by Ma Liu-hai and his group member Lian Wanlu, they proposed a guarantee of 70 centimeters per day. In less than half a month, they increased it to 130 centimeters per day, and in June, they created a new record of 208 centimeters. Ma Liu-hai was honorably elected as a national coal mine industry labor model. This is a scene of him carrying out slow tunneling.

(4) In June of this year, the Ma Liu-hai Group was the first to formulate a patriotic production increase plan. After responding to the call to carry out the patriotic production increase competition movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they signed contact contracts with various shifts, improved labor organization, and guaranteed rapid tunneling of 300 meters per month. In order to cooperate in completing this glorious task, the administration also signed a collective contract with the Ma Liu-hai Group, guaranteeing timely supply of materials and tools, and creating better production conditions for the Ma Liu-hai Group. This is a scene of them revising the production increase plan.

(5) In order to better master technology and improve tunneling efficiency, Ma Liu-hai and all the group members often held group meetings to conduct criticism and self-criticism, accept mass opinions, and in addition to correcting shortcomings in their work at any time, they also overcame the group's departmentalism and technical conservative ideas, and did a good job of unity, which greatly improved production efficiency. This is a scene of them holding a group meeting.

(6) The Ma Liu-hai Group also established a technical research meeting during shift handover, using the time before taking over the shift to learn from each other, study and solve all difficult problems in their work. In the past, the unity between tunneling workers and transporting workers was not sufficient, so the coal in the roadway could not be pushed out in time, affecting the tunneling work. Later, after Ma Liu-hai's patient persuasion and education, the past phenomenon of disunity was corrected.

(7) Ma Liu-hai's spirit of diligent study is also one of the important reasons why he created the highest record for rapid tunneling. He not only learns from workers at any time, but also humbly learns from technical personnel; he not only conducts research and study in his spare time, but also does not relax the opportunity to study on the working face. In this way, he quickly mastered the new coal mining technology and achieved brilliant results in production. This is a scene of Ma Liu-hai studying the position, depth and angle of drilling with technical personnel on the working face.

(8) In their work, the Ma Liu-hai Group also learned from each other and researched together. Qiu De of the Ma Liu-hai Group achieved very good results with his method of bottoming out, while Ma Liu-hai's method of opening up was not as good as that of other workers. Therefore, in order to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses and improve production efficiency, they often learned from each other. This is a scene of Ma Liu-hai and Qiu De learning from each other on the working face.

(9) The Ma Liu-hai Group also did a very reasonable job in the division of labor and arrangement of work procedures. Ma Liu-hai divided the whole group into three shifts, which took turns tunneling. In order not to delay the drilling time, each shift left the next shift with sharpened drill bits and an empty roadway. When taking over the shift, one person first went to the roadway to take over the situation of the working face, and checked the water, lines, electric drills, and the specifications of the roadway, one person went to carry explosive earth, and one person sharpened drill bits and tied explosives, so that when the roadway was taken over clearly, the person carrying explosive earth also arrived, and then the two of them started drilling work, which would not delay the work time. This is a scene of handing over work in the roadway.

(10) At the beginning of the work, two people drilled, and one person loaded explosives. After the drilling work was completed, the two drillers went to another roadway to drill, and the person loading explosives carried out the blasting work. This eliminates idle manpower and eliminates the phenomenon of work stoppages.

(11) Ma Liu-hai developed the experience of cyclical rapid tunneling, and arranged the working time more closely. When the transporting workers were pushing coal in another roadway, the drillers were drilling and blasting in the original roadway, so that when another roadway was cleaned up, they could turn to the cleaned roadway to work, and the transporting workers turned to the roadway after blasting to carry out the work of pushing coal. They also laid iron plates on the working face to facilitate loading, and installed switches on the single-track roadway to facilitate the exit of heavy vehicles and the entry of empty vehicles, which further improved the efficiency of pushing coal.

(12) In order to save materials for the country, Ma Liu-hai paid great attention to avoiding waste in his work. In order to prevent explosives from being wasted due to moisture, Ma Liu-hai often educated all the explosive loading workers in the group that they must never load explosives early in waterways.

(13) On July 8th of this year, the Datong Mining Bureau held a celebration meeting, and the Ma Liu-hai Group honorably received nine prize flags and 10 million yuan in bonuses. In order to actively support the Chinese People's Volunteers and consolidate national defense, the Ma Liu-hai Group, in addition to proposing 3.4 million yuan from the bonus as a donation, further launched a patriotic production increase competition upsurge. In September, they created a national record of 479 meters of tunneling, which greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers of the Datong Mining Bureau.

(14) In order to widely promote Ma Liu-hai's advanced production experience, the Datong Mining Bureau held a Ma Liu-hai advanced production experience dissemination class, exchanged experiences with each other, and studied and improved coal mining methods, which was very effective. This is a scene of Ma Liu-hai explaining the position of drilling in the dissemination class.

(15) The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government held a National Coal Mine Production Technology Conference in Beijing from November 25th to exchange advanced production experiences and widely promote Ma Liu-hai's advanced coal mining methods. Ma Liu-hai made a report at the conference, and proposed a guarantee of tunneling 500 meters per month from December 15th of this year to the end of 1952 to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    推广马六孩小组经验，提高煤矿掘进效率。
    （一）马六孩是大同矿务局的采煤工人。他在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导和教育下，发挥了工人阶级的积极性和创造性，带动了全大同矿务局的生产工作。一九五○年九月马六孩并光荣地被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。今年六月份起，马六孩为了响应开展抗美援朝爱国主义增产竞赛运动的号召，连续创造了全国煤矿掘进最高纪录。
    （二）在中国共产党和人民政府的不断教育启发下，马六孩深深地感觉到新中国工人阶级的光荣和幸福。他为了热爱自己伟大的祖国，发挥了高度的创造智慧，首先实行了“多扎道掘进循环作业法”，连续地创造了全国煤矿掘进的新纪录，为国家累积了巨大的财富。这是中国共产党大同矿务局支部委员会干事与马六孩谈话时的情形。
    （三）一九五○年四月起大同矿务局展开了生产竞赛运动，为了实行新定额管理，把慢速掘进效率提高到五十公分。当时工人都认为很困难；可是马六孩和同组的连万禄经过仔细琢磨计划后，就提出了日进七十公分的保证。不到半个月，他们就提高到日进一百三十公分，到六月份更创造二百零八公分的新纪录，马六孩光荣地当选了全国煤矿工业劳动模范。这是他在进行慢速掘进时的情形。
    （四）马六孩小组在今年六月份，首先订出爱国增产计划。响应了开展抗美援朝爱国主义增产竞赛运动后，并与各班签订联系合同，改善了劳动组织，保证每月快速掘进三百公尺。行政中为了配合完成这个光荣任务，也和马六孩小组签订了集体合同，保证材料工具供应及时，为马六孩小组创造了更好的生产条件。这是他们在修订增产计划时的情形。
    （五）马六孩为了更好地掌握技术，提高掘进效率，他和全组组员经常召开小组会，展开批评和自我批评，接受群众意见，除随时改正工作中的缺点以外，并克服了小组里本位主义和技术上的保守思想，做好团结工作，使生产效率大大提高。这是他们开小组会时的情形。
    （六）马六孩小组在交接班时又建立了技术研究会，利用接班前的时间，互相学习研究，解决工作中的一切困难问题。过去掘进工和运搬工之间的团结是不够的，因此巷道里的煤不能及时推出，影响掘进工作。后来经过马六孩的耐心说服和教育，纠正了过去不团结的现象。
    （七）马六孩认真学习的精神，也是他创造快速掘进最高纪录的重要原因之一。他不但随时向工人学习，同时也很虚心地向技术人员学习；他不但在工作闲暇中进行研究学习，就是在工作面上也不放松学习的机会。这样他很快地就掌握了新的采煤技术，获得了生产上的辉煌成绩。这是马六孩在工作面上与技术人员研究打眼的位置、深度和角度时的情形。
    （八）在工作中，马六孩小组又进行互相学习、研究。马六孩小组邱德的起底办法是获得很好成绩的，而马六孩的开帮办法又是其他工人作得比较差的。因此，他们为了相互间取长补短，提高生产效率，所以经常进行互相学习。这是马六孩和邱德在工作面上互相进行学习时的情形。
    （九）马六孩小组对工作分工和工作程序的安排也做得非常合理。马六孩将全组分成三个班，轮流掘进。他为了不误打眼时间，每班给下一班留下了磨好的钎子和一个空巷道。接班时由一人先到巷道里接交工作面的情况，并检查水、线、电钻和巷道的规格，一人去背炮土，一人磨钎子和绑炮，这样等巷道接交清楚时，背炮土的也就来了，于是他们两人就开始打眼工作，不会延误工作时间。这是在巷道里进行交接工作时的情形。
    （十）在工作开始时，由二人进行打眼，一人进行装炮，等打眼工作完毕后，打眼的二人就到另一巷道去打眼，装炮的一人就进行放炮工作。这样就可以免除人力的空闲，消灭窝工现象。
    （十一）马六孩发展了循环快速掘进经验，更紧凑地安排好了工作时间。当运搬工在另一巷道里推煤的时候，打眼放炮的就在原巷道里打眼放炮，这样等另一巷道清理完毕后，他们就可以转到已经清理好的巷道里去工作，运搬工再转到放炮后的巷道里进行推煤工作。他们并在工作面铺上铁板，便利装车，在单道的巷道，安上道岔，便利出重车，进空车，更提高了推煤效率。
    （十二）马六孩为了给国家节省材料，他在工作中十分注意避免浪费现象。马六孩为了不使炮药因受潮湿而造成浪费，他经常教育全组装炮工人，有水的巷道里决不要早装炮。
    （十三）今年七月八日大同矿务局召开了庆功大会，马六孩小组光荣地得到了九面奖旗和一千万元奖金。马六孩小组为了积极支援人民志愿军和巩固国防力量，除在奖金中提出三百四十万元作为捐献以外，并更进一步地掀起了爱国主义增产竞赛热潮。九月份创造了掘进四百七十九公尺的全国最高纪录，大大地鼓舞了大同矿务局工人的生产情绪。
    （十四）大同矿务局为了普遍推广马六孩的先进生产经验，举办了马六孩先进生产经验传播班，互相交流经验，研究改进采煤方法，收效很大。这是马六孩在传播班上讲述打眼位置时的情形。（十五）中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局于十一月二十五日起在北京召开了全国煤矿生产技术会议，交流先进生产经验，普遍推广马六孩的先进采煤方法。马六孩在大会上作了报告，并提出从今年十二月十五日起到一九五二年底止每月掘进五百公尺的保证，来响应毛主席的增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军的伟大号召。
