    Is There Enough Patriotism?
    Lao She
    I have participated in the ideological study of Beijing's literary and art circles. Although the study is still in progress and it is not yet time to summarize, I have already gained a lot of benefits. Now, let me just talk about one thing: We have been advocating literary and artistic works rich in patriotism for more than a day or two, but why are such literary and artistic works still rare? After these few days of ideological study, I have come to realize that in the hearts of some literary and art writers—including myself—there are still many petty-bourgeois thoughts. The petty-bourgeoisie's method of knowing when enough is enough is also manifested in the matter of patriotism. The patriotic enthusiasm of our People's Volunteer Army is infinite; for the sake of loving the motherland, they can shed all their blood and sweat, sacrifice their lives, and hold nothing back. Their patriotism knows no bounds. But us? We even have enough patriotism. Therefore, after writing a short article or a short poem to promote patriotism, we feel that we have fulfilled our patriotic responsibilities and do not need to work any harder. Our patriotic heart is limited, so what we write is so little. Although what we write is little, if there is genuine emotion in it that can move people, it is still acceptable. However, what we write is both little and thin, and does not contain fervent emotions. Originally, since our patriotism knows when enough is enough, where would we get so much enthusiasm? Hearing the heroic deeds of the People's Volunteer Army, although we are full of praise, we do not think that we should also work hard in literary writing and make some heroic deeds on the "literary battlefield."

    Some veteran writers—including myself—are more likely to adopt a "enough is enough" attitude. They think that being able to follow everyone in supporting the spirit of patriotism in literature and art is enough, and there is no need to personally pick up a pen to write works. Furthermore, writing long works may not leave enough time; writing short works like clapperditties is feared to lead to a loss of status. As a result, the Volunteer Army themselves wrote clapperditties, ballads, and short poems, but the veteran writers did not. The Volunteer Army truly loves the country, so they can truly write patriotic literary and artistic works; our patriotism is poor, so we slack off. Just take writing clapperditties as an example, veteran writers will say: I don't know how to write clapperditties. However, how did the Volunteer Army learn, but we cannot learn? Hmph, we simply don't want to learn! Belittling clapperditties and not learning clapperditties is all because our patriotic heart is not enough. The Volunteer Army did not delay fighting and killing enemies to be heroes because they learned clapperditties and wrote clapperditties, but we neither fought nor wrote. We are busy, but aren't the Volunteer Army busy fighting? We did not put patriotism into literary and artistic tasks, so we either never wrote patriotic works, or the ones we wrote were not energetic. This is worth reflecting on.

    Love our motherland, "enough is enough" will not work!
    Today I will only write this little bit. I deeply hope that the Volunteer Army comrades can see this little bit. I know they will not laugh at me, but will encourage me: Study actively, don't be satisfied with "enough is enough"!

    爱国也有够吗
    老舍
    我参加了北京文艺界的思想学习。虽然学习还正在进行，没到作总结的时候，可是我已经得到不少好处。现在，我只说一样事吧：我们提倡富有爱国主义精神的文艺已经不是一天两天了，可是这种文艺作品为什么还不多见呢？经过这几天的思想学习，我体会到：在一部分文艺作家们——我自己在内——的心中，还存着不少小资产阶级的思想。小资产阶级的适可而止的办法，也会表现在爱国这件事情上。我们的人民志愿军的爱国热情是无限的；为了爱祖国，他们能流尽了血汗，牺牲了性命，毫无保留。他们爱国没有够。我们呢，连爱国也有够。因此，我们写了一篇小文，或一首小诗，宣传爱国主义，就觉得已经尽了爱国的责任，不必再多操劳。我们的爱国心有限，所以写的也就那么少。写的虽少，假若里边有真感情，能感动人，也还说得过去。可是，我们写的既少又薄，并没有火热的感情。不感动人。本来吗，我们爱国既有够，哪里会有那么多的热情呢？听到人民志愿军的英雄事迹，我们虽然赞叹不已，可并不想我们在文艺写作上也得去拚命，在“文艺战场”上作出些英雄事迹来。
    一些老作家们——我自己在内——更容易采取适可而止的态度。他们以为能够跟着大家拥护文艺中应有爱国主义的精神，也就够瞧的了，用不着再亲自提笔写出作品来。再说，写长作品，也许没有工夫；写快板一类的短作品，又怕失去身份。结果呢，志愿军自己写出了快板、鼓词、短诗，而老作家们没有。志愿军真爱国，也就真能写出爱国主义的文艺作品；我们爱国差劲，所以怠工。姑且拿写快板来说吧，老作家们会说：不会写快板啊。但是，志愿军怎么学会了，我们就学不会呢？哼，我们根本不想去学！轻视快板，不去学快板，都是我们的爱国心不够。志愿军并没因为学快板，写快板，耽误了打仗杀敌作英雄，我们既没打仗，也没写。我们忙啊，难道志愿军打仗不忙么？我们并没把爱国主义放进文艺任务里去，所以我们不是始终没写出爱国主义的作品，便是写了也不带劲。这值得我们反省。
    热爱我们的祖国吧，适可而止不行！
    今天我只写这一点点。我深盼志愿军同志们能看到这一点点。我知道他们不会耻笑我，而会鼓励我：积极地学习吧，别适可而止！
