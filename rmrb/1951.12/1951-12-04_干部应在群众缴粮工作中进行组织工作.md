    Cadres Should Conduct Organizational Work in Mass Grain Delivery

    To the Editor: I believe that in the work of delivering public grain, in addition to carrying out patriotic education for farmers, organizational work is very important. If the organization is good and the planning is thorough, the task can be completed well; otherwise, the public grain will not be delivered well, and accidents may occur. For example, in Gushan Township, Fifth District, Lincheng County, Shandong Province, four days before the designated grain delivery date, the masses formed groups of fifteen households each, and each group of households compared the quality of grain with each other. If any substandard grain was found, they organized sifting or sun-drying. As a result, after the grain from this township was delivered to the granary, no household was returned, no household needed sifting, and no household had any arrears. In order to effectively carry out the organizational work of paying patriotic public grain, some townships in Shandong Province also established "Patriotic Public Grain Payment Committees," forming "Patriotic Public Grain Payment Brigades" with the township as the unit, and the villages below the township were formed into squadrons, and then into groups. Grain was prepared in advance, and after inspection, the grain was collectively delivered according to the date designated by the granary.

    However, in Changqing County of Tai'an Prefecture, because the cadres were eager for quick results and the organizational work was not done well, the moisture content of the corn received reached 19%; in the Eleventh District of Yishui County, one household delivered 20 catties of soybeans, of which 5 catties were chaff. The granary in the Second District of Teng County had poor prior organizational work and could not receive grain on time. Meng Qingyu and other grain delivery people waited for two days before delivering their grain. He suffered a relapse of an old illness due to overwork, and because the warehouse staff did not take good care of him, he died. In Lincheng County, the masses died of a cow on the way to deliver grain, and a grain delivery person had a leg broken. Similar situations also occurred in Qufu, Shounan and other counties. Therefore, organizing the masses to deliver grain is a matter that urgently needs to be paid attention to in various places.    Yi Zhi, Jiang Mingxian

    Editor's Note: Organizing the delivery of public grain is a complex and arduous political task. Therefore, any satisfaction with the enthusiasm of the masses in delivering grain, or a simple task-oriented view that is eager for quick results, will bring losses to the people. Governments at all levels must treat this work with a serious and responsible spirit.

### 干部应在群众缴粮工作中进行组织工作

    干部应在群众缴粮工作中进行组织工作
    编辑同志：我觉得在缴纳公粮的工作中，除了对农民进行爱国主义教育外，组织工作很重要。组织的好，计划周到，就能很好完成任务，否则公粮就缴不好，就可能发生事故。如山东临城县第五区孤山乡的群众，在指定送粮的前四天，就以十五户为单位，编成了小组，各组各户互相评比粮质，发现不合标准的粮食，就组织筛簸或翻晒。因此这个乡的粮食送到粮库以后，无一户被退回，无一户需要筛簸，也无一户尾欠。为了切实做好缴纳爱国公粮的组织工作，山东地区的部分乡还成立了“爱国公粮缴纳委员会”，以乡为单位编成了“缴纳爱国公粮大队”，乡以下的村编成中队，再编成小组，事先把粮食准备好，并经过检查，然后再按照粮库指定的日期，集体缴粮。
    但在泰安专区长清县因为干部急于求成，组织工作作得不好，收的玉米，水分达百分之十九；沂水县十一区有一户送的二十斤豆子，其中秕子就有五斤。滕县第二区粮库，事先组织工作差，不能按时收粮，送粮群众孟庆禹等了两天才缴上粮食，他因劳动过度，旧病复发，加上仓库人员对他照顾又差，以致死亡。临城县群众在送粮途中死了一头牛，还有一个送粮群众，被压断一条腿。其他如曲阜、寿南等县，也有类似情况发生。因此组织群众缴粮，是一件亟应引起各地注意的事。    易之  蒋明显
    编者按：组织缴纳公粮是一件复杂而艰巨的政治任务。因此，任何满足于群众缴粮热情，或急于求成的单纯任务观点，都会给人民带来损失。各级政府必须以严肃负责的精神对待这一工作。
