    Yan Fuxiang is Removed from Office for Violating Cooperative Principles
    Yan Fuxiang, the director of the Zhaoshuangmiao Cooperative in Qinghe County, Hebei Province, and a Communist Party member, has been punished for undermining the principles of the cooperative. According to the cooperative's regulations, the prices for non-members to buy goods at the cooperative in rural areas should be different from those for members, but Yan Fuxiang treated everyone the same. Some members said, "What's the difference between members and non-members? You can buy cheap goods even if you don't join the cooperative!" This hindered the development of the cooperative. Yan Fuxiang also casually extended credit, totaling 570,000 yuan in goods according to an investigation. In August of this year, when the county cooperative decided to merge the Zhaoshuangmiao Cooperative and the Xielu Cooperative, Yan resisted the idea ideologically. Taking advantage of accountant Peng Guangze's illness, he colluded with private merchants, selling them a large quantity of cotton and extending credit to private merchants for 2,315 catties of cotton within a week. After the higher-level authorities discovered Yan Fuxiang's policy violations, they immediately removed him from his position. The Party is also considering disciplinary action against him.

    阎福祥违反合作社原则受到撤职处分
    河北清河县朝双庙合作社主任、共产党员阎福祥，破坏合作社原则，受到处分。按合作社的规定，在农村里非社员到合作社买东西，在价格上是和社员不一样的，但阎福祥却一律对待。有些社员说：“社员和非社员有什么区别呢？不入社一样也可以买到便宜货！”这样，就妨碍了合作社的发展。阎福祥还随便赊账，据调查共赊出货物折价五十七万元。今年八月间，当县合作社决定朝双庙合作社和谢芦合作社合并后，阎思想上有抵抗，乘着会计彭光泽有病，就和私商勾结起来，把大批棉花卖给私商，并且在一星期内赊给私商棉花二三、○一五斤。上级机关发觉阎福祥这种违反政策的行为后，立刻就把阎福祥撤职。党内也正研究要给他以处分。
