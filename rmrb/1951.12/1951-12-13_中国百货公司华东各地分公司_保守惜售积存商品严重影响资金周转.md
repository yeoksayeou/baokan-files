    China Department Store East China Branches:
    Conservative Reluctance to Sell Leads to Serious Impact on Capital Turnover
    Some leading cadres in the East China branches of the China Department Store have conservative ideas and are reluctant to sell, resulting in serious accumulation of state funds and hindering the completion of material supply plans.

    From the perspective of commodity inventory, the phenomenon of stockpiling is widespread and serious, especially in the Shandong and Zhejiang provincial branches. For example, the Shandong Provincial Branch's sock inventory as of the end of September, based on October sales (the peak season for urban-rural exchange), was enough to sell for seven months, shirts for twenty months, thermos bottles for sixteen months, carbon paper for eight months, cotton underwear for six months, and inner and outer tires, toothpaste, bed sheets, and enamel basins for five months. Other items such as tea, based on the average monthly sales volume for the entire year, could be sold for twenty months. The number of bicycles in stock at the Ningbo branch of Zhejiang Province at the end of September was twelve times the average monthly sales volume of the company in the third quarter. The sock inventory of the Shanghai Municipal Company at the end of October, based on October sales, could be sold for five months, and matches for twenty-one months.

    The average completion rate of sales plans in the entire East China region in October was only 77.31 percent. Only northern Jiangsu exceeded the target, while southern Jiangsu and Shandong completed more than 90 percent. Shanghai only completed 58.05 percent, Nanjing completed 60.69 percent, and other regions generally completed 70 to 80 percent.

    Looking at the situation of procurement and sales, if the commodity inventory of the entire East China region at the end of August is taken as 100, it increased to 119.63 at the end of September and 111.05 at the end of October. In southern Jiangsu, if the inventory at the end of September is taken as 100, it increased to 140.6 at the end of October. In Shandong, the inventory at the end of October was 111.35 percent of the inventory at the end of September. In most other regions, the degree of commodity stockpiling also showed a trend of increasing month by month.

    Because the supply and sales plans have not been conscientiously implemented, the capital turnover is very slow; the slow capital turnover results in a relatively increased interest burden, accounting for about 40 percent of the total commodity circulation expenses. The proportion of interest in the total turnover is also beyond the normal range. Taking the proportion of interest in turnover in the third quarter as an example, the entire region was 3.64 percent in July, 3.33 percent in August, and 4.33 percent in September. According to the requirements of the higher authorities, the monthly interest rate is calculated at 1.5 percent, which is only 3 percent in two months. Measured by this standard, the interest rates in July and August both exceeded the regulations by more than one time, and in September it almost reached two times.

    Although many cadres in the East China Department Store Company have now initially reversed their conservative reluctance to sell, they still generally believe that department stores are goods in short supply. Therefore, they still do not use their brains to improve operations for goods that require a little effort to sell. This makes it impossible to complete the tasks that should be completed and impossible to exceed the targets that could be exceeded. (Jiefang Daily)

### 中国百货公司华东各地分公司  保守惜售积存商品严重影响资金周转

    中国百货公司华东各地分公司
    保守惜售积存商品严重影响资金周转
    中国百货公司华东各地分公司，部分领导干部有保守惜售思想，使国家资金严重积压，妨碍了物资供应计划的完成。
    从商品结存方面看，积压现象是普遍而且严重的，特别是山东、浙江两省的分公司是如此。像山东省分公司的袜子，以九月底的结存量，用十月份的销量（城乡交流最旺的季节）推算，足足够销七个月，衬衫可销二十个月，热水瓶可销十六个月，复写纸可销八个月，棉毛衫可销六个月，内外胎、牙膏、被单、搪瓷面盆可销五个月；其他如茶叶结存，以全年每月平均销售量推算，可卖二十个月。浙江宁波分公司九月底结存的自行车数量，为该公司第三季度平均每月销售量的十二倍。上海市公司十月底结存的袜子，按十月份的销量推算可销五个月，火柴可销二十一个月。
    各地销售计划，十月份全区平均只完成百分之七十七点三一。只有苏北超额完成，苏南、山东完成九成多；上海只完成百分之五十八点○五，南京完成百分之六十点六九，其他各地一般完成百分之七十到八十。
    再就进货和销货的情况来看，如果把华东全区八月底的商品结存额作为一百，九月底就增加到一百一十九点六三，十月底增到一百一十一点○五。苏南如果把九月底结存额作为一百，十月底就增加到一百四十点六。山东十月底为九月结存额的百分之一百一十一点三五。其他大部地区商品积压的程度，也都有逐月上升的趋势。
    因为供售计划没有认真贯彻执行，所以资金周转很慢；资金周转慢，利息负担就相对增加到约占全部商品流转费用的四成。利息占全部流转额比例之大也超出一般情况之外。拿第三季度利息占流转额的比例来说，全区七月份为百分之三点六四，八月份为百分之三点三三，九月份为百分之四点三三。根据上级的要求，月息按一分半计算，两个月才不过百分之三。用这个标准来衡量，那么，七、八两月份的利息都超过规定一倍多，九月份几乎达到两倍。
    华东区百货公司很多干部现在虽然初步扭转了保守惜售思想，但总以为百货是供不应求的东西，因此对要稍费气力销售的商品，仍不动脑筋改进经营。这就使应该完成的任务不能完成，可能超过的不能超过。（解放日报）
