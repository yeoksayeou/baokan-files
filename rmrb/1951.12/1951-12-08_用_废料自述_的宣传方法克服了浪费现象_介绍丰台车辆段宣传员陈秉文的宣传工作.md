	Overcoming Waste Through "Waste Material Autobiography" Propaganda Method – Introducing the Propaganda Work of Chen Bingwen, Propaganda Officer of Fengtai Vehicle Depot

	Chen Bingwen, a propaganda officer at the Fengtai Vehicle Depot of the Tianjin Railway Administration, has achieved good results in opposing material waste by using the "waste material autobiography" propaganda method. In June of this year, after Chen Bingwen returned from the first representative conference of propaganda officers in Tianjin, he found a lot of usable materials thrown in the depot's scrap pile; workers preferred to use new materials and were unwilling to use old ones. Some materials that could be used were not, and some that could be repaired were not. Chen Bingwen thought that wasting materials would cause great losses to the country, and everyone must be reminded to pay attention. How to attract everyone's attention? He remembered that someone at the propaganda officer representative conference introduced the propaganda method of "light bulb tearful autobiography" and planned to carry out a "waste material autobiography" propaganda as well. Once the idea was decided, he went to discuss it with the Party branch secretary. The Party branch secretary agreed to do so, and Chen Bingwen began to prepare. He first asked woodworking workers to make a waste material exhibition stand, put materials such as car door lifting links, small round pins, and air duct plugs picked up from the scrap pile on it, and wrote a "autobiography" on each item, with the unit price marked. For example, on a small round pin, it was written: "My name is Xiao Yuanxiao [small round pin], no vehicle can do without me; but the master doesn't love me, and throws me away casually." Another example is written on an air duct plug: "You suffer less than me, it took effort to make me in the beginning, now you treat me like dirt, how can I not complain!" The "waste material autobiography" exhibition attracted the attention of the workers, and the exhibition stand was crowded with people every time after get off work. After seeing it, workers from the A Inspection team went back and asked the foreman: "Were the waste materials on the exhibition stand picked up from our place?" That night, they held a group meeting and unanimously agreed: materials that can be repaired must not be thrown away, strive to return to the original source, and ensure the quality of the finished product.
	After Chen Bingwen set up the waste material exhibition, he also paid attention to the workers' reactions. He found a lot of black axle oil spilled on the ground at the site, and a lot of hand washing oil spilled at the oil door; some people in the administrative department often used form paper as toilet paper. He then put the black axle oil and form paper on the exhibition stand again, and criticized them in the form of an autobiography.
	After this period of "waste material autobiography" exhibition, the phenomenon of wasting materials in the entire vehicle depot was greatly reduced; however, the workers in the auxiliary repair team were still not doing well, and small parts were still being thrown around everywhere. Once, Zhang, the director of the depot, picked up a lot of pad plates, small eye circles, and other materials on the lane where the auxiliary repair team worked and sent them to propaganda officer Chen Bingwen. Chen Bingwen then strung those usable materials together with iron wire, hung them on the exhibition stand, and attached an article "Waste Material Accuses Auxiliary Repair Team," criticizing them by name. When the workers saw it, they warned each other, "The waste material has accused the auxiliary repair team, we must pay more attention." The auxiliary repair team immediately held a meeting to conduct an inspection and assured the staff meeting: "We will never throw away materials again, and we must use what can be used."
	In summary, during the waste material exhibition period, the braking team alone picked out 300 screws and 150 small round pins from the scrap pile; repaired six broken air gauges and fifteen warm air valves. The value of this batch of materials, if calculated, is very large.
	From the waste material exhibition propaganda, the idea that "wasting materials is shameful and saving materials is glorious" has slowly become the trend. At this time, Chen Bingwen compiled a short allegro piece, named "Waste Material Thanks," announced it, and praised Xu Fengming, who used the most waste materials; further encouraging the workers and enhancing their belief that saving materials is glorious.

    用“废料自述”的宣传方法克服了浪费现象
    ——介绍丰台车辆段宣传员陈秉文的宣传工作
    小孟
    天津铁路管理局丰台车辆段宣传员陈秉文，用“废料自述”的宣传方法，反对浪费器材，效果很好。今年六月，陈秉文从天津开了第一届宣传员代表大会回来，发现段内废料堆里扔着不少可用的材料；工友都愿意用新材料，不愿意用旧材料，有些材料能用也不用，能修也不修。陈秉文想，浪费材料将给国家造成很大损失，必须提醒大家注意。怎样引起大家的注意呢？他想起了宣传员代表会上有人介绍了“电灯泡流泪自述”的宣传方法，打算也进行一个“废料自述”的宣传。主意既定，就去和党支部书记商量。党支部书记同意这样作，陈秉文就着手筹备了。他先请木工工友做好一个废料展览台，把废料堆里拣出来的车门吊练、小元肖、风管堵等材料放上去，并且每件上写了一段“自述”，订上单价。如小元肖上写道：“我叫小元肖，那个车辆离我都不成；但是主人不爱我，随随便便把我扔。”又如风管堵上写道：“你们苦来不如我，当初造我费了劲，如今把我当粪土，叫我怎么不诉苦！”“废料自述”的展览，引起了工人们的注意，每到下班时，展览台前就围满了人。甲检工人看了回去问工长：“展览台上的废料是不是从咱们这里拣去的？”当天晚上，他们开了小组会，一致通过：能修的材料，决不扔掉，争取原来原走，保证成品的质量。
    陈秉文布置了废料展览以后，又注意工人的反应。他发现现场地上洒了很多黑轴油，油门门口又洒了很多洗手油；事务部门有人常拿表格纸当大便纸用。他就又把黑轴油和表格纸张放到展览台上。并用自述形式进行批评。
    经过这一段“废料自述”展览后，全车辆段浪费材料的现象大大减少；但是辅修组的工人还做得不好，小零件仍然到处乱扔。有一回，该段张段长，在辅修组工作的车道上，拣了不少的肖垫板、小眼圈等材料，送给宣传员陈秉文。陈秉文就用铁丝把那些能用的材料串起来，挂在展览台上，并附了一篇“废料控诉辅修组”的文章。指名批评。工人们一看，互相警告说：“废料已控告辅修组了，咱们可得加倍注意。”辅修组马上开会进行了检查。并向职工大会保证：“以后再不丢材料，能用的一定要用。”
    总括废料展览期间，仅仅制动组就从废料堆里拣出来三百条镙丝、一百五十个小元肖；修好了六个坏风表、十五个暖解闷。这一批材料的价值，如果计算一下，是很大的。
    从废料展览宣传中，“浪费材料为可耻，节省材料为光荣”的思想慢慢地成为风气了。这时，陈秉文又编了一段快板，提名“废料道谢”，公布出来，表扬利用废料最多的徐凤鸣；进一步鼓励了工人，增强了他们的节省材料是光荣的信念。
