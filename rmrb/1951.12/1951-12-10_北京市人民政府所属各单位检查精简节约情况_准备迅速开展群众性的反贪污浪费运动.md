    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing News Agency: In November, all staff members of units affiliated with the Beijing Municipal People's Government conscientiously studied the various reports and resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They further recognized the great significance of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and ideological remolding. In particular, they deeply recognized the necessity and possibility of "streamlining organizations, adjusting institutions, reducing levels, and streamlining personnel." Currently, all units affiliated with the Beijing Municipal People's Government are preparing to conduct in-depth inspections of simplification and savings in conjunction with year-end summary work, and launch a mass anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign.

    After the closing of the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mayor Peng Zhen first delivered a report. Subsequently, the 87th administrative meeting of the Municipal People's Government decided to organize all cadres to study the documents of the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Furthermore, on November 17, a general cadre meeting was convened, at which Vice Mayor Wu Han conveyed the spirit of the various documents. After the meeting, all units affiliated with the Municipal People's Government, according to the arrangements of the Municipal People's Government Study Committee, conscientiously led the cadres in study, in conjunction with the actual work of each unit.

    Before the start of the study, some staff members did not fully understand the significance of the movement to increase production and practice economy. Some asked, "What can our administrative organs increase production and economize on?" Some even said, "Simplification and savings, this is not the first time; won't it just pass after some clamoring?" After this study, cadres generally recognized that increasing production and practicing economy is not only to strengthen the power of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but also a fundamental way to build the motherland, and is equally important for the work of political power organs. Staff members of various units have initially checked their work and corrected some phenomena of extravagance and waste, and inefficient work. Some units have also set out preliminary plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and quickly improved their work. For example, staff members of the General Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Document Section proposed a method of scientific division of labor, which can save one or two cadres. At the same time, they plan to increase typing efficiency from 800 words per hour to 1,000 words, and reduce errors from 3 per thousand to 2 per thousand. This one section alone plans to save the state 10,000 jin of millet in expenses next year. Staff members of units affiliated with the Construction Bureau came up with many ways to save on daily necessities. They plan to save more than 7.57 million yuan in December from paper, stationery, electricity, telephones, coal, water, bicycle repair costs, etc. The Third Tax Bureau carefully calculated and improved work efficiency, freeing up eleven internal staff members to strengthen external work.

    After the conclusion of this study, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu gave a report at the Municipal People's Government Section Chief and above cadre meeting on December 1. He called on all units to conduct in-depth inspections of the situation of increasing production and practicing economy in conjunction with the year-end summary work, and to rapidly launch a mass movement against corruption and waste.

    北京市人民政府所属各单位检查精简节约情况
    准备迅速开展群众性的反贪污浪费运动
    【本报讯】据北京市新闻处讯：北京市人民政府所属各单位全体工作人员，在十一月份认真学习了人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的各项报告和决议，进一步认识了抗美援朝、增产节约、思想改造的重大意义，特别深刻地认识到了“紧缩编制，调整机构，减少层次，精简人员”的必要和可能。现在，北京市人民政府所属各单位正准备结合年终总结工作，深入检查精简节约的情况，开展群众性的反贪污浪费运动。
    在人民政协全国委员会第三次会议闭幕以后，彭真市长首先做了一次报告。接着，市人民政府第八十七次行政会议决定组织全体干部学习人民政协全国委员会第三次会议的文件。并且在十一月十七日召开了全体干部大会，由吴晗副市长传达了各项文件的精神。会后，市人民政府所属各单位就根据市人民政府学习委员会的布置，结合各单位的实际工作情况，认真地领导干部进行了学习。
    学习开始以前，有些工作人员对于增产节约运动的意义认识不够，有人问：“我们行政机关，有什么可增产节约的呢？”甚至有人说：“精简节约，这不是头一回，还不是嚷嚷就过去了。”经过这次学习，干部们普遍认识到增产节约不仅是为了加强抗美援朝的力量，而且是建设祖国的根本办法，对于政权机关工作，同样有头等重要意义。各单位工作人员都初步检查了自己的工作，纠正了一些铺张浪费、工作效率不高的现象。有的单位还定出了增产节约的初步计划，迅速改进了自己的工作。例如供销合作总社文书科工作人员提出了科学分工的办法，可以节省干部一人或二人。同时，他们准备把打字效率由每小时八百字提高到一千字，并且把差错由千分之三减少到千分之二。仅仅这一个科，就准备在明年替国家节约一万斤小米的开支。建设局所属各单位工作人员想出了节约日常用品的许多办法。他们准备在十二月份内，从纸张、文具、电灯、电话、煤、水、自行车修理费等方面共节省七百五十七万余元。税务第三分局精打细算，提高工作效率，腾出了十一个内勤工作人员去加强外勤工作。
    这次学习结束以后，张友渔副市长在十二月一日市人民政府科长以上干部会议上作了报告。他号召各单位结合年终总结工作，深入检查增产节约的情况，迅速开展反贪污浪费的群众运动。
