    Everyone Should Expose Corrupt and Bribery-Taking Personnel
    Reader Zhang Jian Exposes Bribery by Jia Qiansheng of the People's Printing Plant and Xu Min of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Comrade Editor: I am a staff member of the private Zhong Sheng Trading Company in Beijing. When I was at the counter, I often saw Jia Qiansheng, a technician in charge of loudspeakers and film projectors at the People's Printing Plant, come to our Zhong Sheng Trading Company to purchase telecommunications equipment for the People's Printing Plant. He and our manager, Hou Jiaqin, had known each other for a long time. Every time he bought telecommunications equipment, Manager Hou would give him a bribe of 10% of the commodity's value. The amount he embezzled in this area is unknown. Last year, he purchased a film projector for the People's Printing Plant from the Qiangsheng Film Projector Factory. Afterwards, Li Yunfang, the manager of the Qiangsheng Film Projector Factory, gave him a bribe of more than eight bolts of white cloth.
    There is also a man named Xu Min, who is a cadre of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. When he was studying at the Heavy Industry School, he introduced the school to our company to buy an amplifier, thus receiving a bribe (the amount is unknown). After Xu Min graduated and was transferred to work at the Ministry of Heavy Industry, he introduced the Ministry of Heavy Industry to our company to buy an amplifier, and accepted a bribe from our Manager Hou (the amount is unknown). Please handle the above two bribery incidents promptly by the relevant departments.　Zhang Jian

    大家都来检举贪污受贿人员
    读者张笺揭发人民印刷厂贾乾生和重工业部许敏的受贿行为
    编辑同志：我是北京市私营中生商行的工作人员。我在柜上的时候，经常看见人民印刷厂管理扩音机和电影机的技术工人贾乾生，来我们中生商行为人民印刷厂购买电讯器材。他和我行经理侯家勤早就认识了。他每买一次电讯器材，侯经理就送他商品价值百分之十的贿赂费。他在这方面贪污的款项，已不知有多少了。去年他为人民印刷厂购买电影机一部，出售者是强声电影机工厂。事后，强声电影机工厂经理李云芳送他贿赂费八匹多白布。
    还有一位叫许敏的，是中央重工业部的干部。他在重工业学校读书时，曾经给学校介绍，向我行买扩大机一部，因而得到一笔贿赂费（数目不知）。许敏毕业后，调到重工业部工作，他又给重工业部介绍，向我行买扩大机一部，接受了我行侯经理的一笔贿赂费（数目不知）。以上两项受贿事件，请有关部门迅速处理。　张笺
