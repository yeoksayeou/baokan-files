Fight for promoting Hao Jianxiu's work method nationwide.
Most cotton mills in Wuhan
The phenomenon of neglecting the promotion of Hao Jianxiu's work method should be corrected
The Party, administration, and grassroots trade unions of the vast majority of cotton textile factories in Wuhan have not attached importance to the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method. They have not integrated the promotion work with democratic reform, and democratic reform is divorced from production. As of October, only Zhenhuan Yarn Factory had fully launched promotion work in the spinning workshop. Yuhua Yarn Factory, First Yarn Factory, and Shenxin Yarn Factory have only selected some people from each group to study, preparing to fully promote it after "shifting to production" because democratic unity has not yet ended. At present, the promotion work in each factory is only carried out by some cadres sent to the factories by the Central South District Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union. The Party organizations, administrations, and grassroots trade unions of each factory have not led the promotion work. Therefore, the promotion work in each factory has not formed a mass movement. Various problems encountered in the promotion work, such as the inspection system, the finished yarn weighing system, and the contact between workers in various departments, cannot be solved in a timely manner. Wuhan originally planned to promote the Hao Jianxiu work method among all spinning workers this year, but judging from the current situation, this plan is difficult to complete. It is right for the Central South District Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union to send cadres to various factories to promote the Hao Jianxiu work method; however, the masses should also be mobilized to inspect the promotion work of the Hao Jianxiu work method. In this way, a mass movement to promote the Hao Jianxiu work method can be formed; only by forming a mass movement can the promotion work be done well.

    为在全国范围内推广郝建秀工作法而斗争
    武汉市大部分棉纺织厂
    应纠正忽视推广郝建秀工作法的现象
    武汉市绝大多数棉纺织厂的党、行政和基层工会，都没有重视郝建秀工作法的推广工作。他们没有把推广工作和民主改革结合起来，民主改革和生产脱节了。到十月为止，武汉市只有震寰纱厂在细纱车间，全面展开了推广工作。裕华纱厂、第一纱厂、申新纱厂由于民主团结尚未结束，只在各组内抽调一部分人学习，准备“转入生产”后再全面推广。目前，在各厂进行推广工作的，只是中国纺织工会中南区委员会和武汉市委员会派到厂内的一些干部。各厂的党组织、行政和基层工会，则没有领导推广工作。因之，各厂的推广工作就没有形成群众性的运动。推广工作中遇到的各种问题，比如检查制度、成纱过磅制度及各部门工人的联系问题等，都不能及时解决。武汉市原计划在今年要在全体细纱工人中推广郝建秀工作法，但就目前情况看，这个计划是很难完成的。中国纺织工会中南区委员会和武汉市委员会派干部到各厂推广郝建秀工作法，这是对的；但是，还应发动群众，检查郝建秀工作法推广工作。这样，才能形成群众性的推广郝建秀工作法的运动；只有形成群众运动，才能把推广工作作好。
