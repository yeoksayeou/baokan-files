    When Newspapers Hold Current Affairs Quizzes,
    Attention Should Be Paid to Political Purpose and Effect
    Comrade Editor: Regularly conducting current affairs quizzes in newspapers is a simple and feasible method for local newspapers to connect with the masses, guide them in studying current affairs, and improve their level of political awareness. The "Su Nan Daily" has proven this with the current affairs quizzes it has held since September 7th. For example, in the fourth quiz announced by the newspaper on November 1st, 519 test papers were received, of which 304 achieved scores above 90, accounting for almost 60 percent of all test papers. In addition, many local reading groups and schools printed these quiz questions into test papers and conducted general tests on reading group members and students. However, some of the "Su Nan Daily's" quiz questions lack educational significance and political purpose. For example, the fill-in-the-blank question published on page four on October 16th, which read "American planes again strafed Kaesong on the daytime of ( ) month ( ) day, killing and wounding ( ) people on the spot," is a meaningless quiz question. When newspapers in various regions promote and hold current affairs quizzes, they must consider the purpose and effect of the publicity from a political standpoint.

### 报纸举办时事测验时应注意政治目的与效果

    报纸举办时事测验时
    应注意政治目的与效果
    编辑同志：在报纸上经常进行时事测验，是地方报纸联系群众，引导群众学习时事，并提高其政治认识水平的一种简便可行的方法。苏南日报从九月七日起所举办的时事测验就得到了证明。例如该报十一月一日公布的第四次测验中，曾收到试卷五百一十九份，其中有三百零四份试卷的成绩，都是在九十分以上，几占全部试卷的百分之六十。另外，还有很多地方的读报组和学校根据这些测验题印成试卷，对读报组员和学生进行了普遍的测验。但苏南日报的测验题目，有一些是缺乏教育意义和政治目的的。例如十月十六日四版公布的填充题，其中曾有“美机又在（    ）月（    ）日的白天，两次扫射开城，当场死伤（    ）人”一题，这种测验题是没有意义的。各地报纸在推行和举办时事测验时，必须从政治上考虑宣传的目的和效果。
