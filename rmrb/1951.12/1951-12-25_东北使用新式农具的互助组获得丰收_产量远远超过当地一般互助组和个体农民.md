    Northeast Mutual Aid Teams Using New Farm Tools Achieve Bumper Harvests
    Output Far Exceeds That of Ordinary Local Mutual Aid Teams and Individual Farmers

    According to a preliminary investigation by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government: This year, 54 mutual aid teams in the Northeast Administrative Region actively participated in the patriotic bumper harvest movement, used Soviet-style animal-drawn farm tools, and improved farming techniques, thereby achieving a bumper harvest. In Jixian County, Songjiang Province, the soybean yield of 42 mutual aid teams using new farm tools, even under abnormal weather conditions, still reached about 3,000 jin per hectare (one hectare equals 15 mu), exceeding the output of ordinary local mutual aid teams and individual farmers by a factor of two. In Xiangyang Village, Fourteenth District, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, the Ma Qingfu group, using new farm tools for cultivation, planted 100 hectares of wheat this year, with an average yield of 4,000 jin per hectare, creating a new record for high wheat yields in the area. The He Fengshan mutual aid team in Hejiacun Village, Xinglong District, Yushu County, Jilin Province, harvested 3,500 jin of wheat per hectare, exceeding the wheat yield of local farmers using old-style plows by 1,000 jin. Particularly outstanding were the wheat yields of the Gao Zhen mutual aid team in Nineteen Village, Second District, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, which harvested 5,400 jin per hectare this year; and the wheat yields of the Liu Wenbin group in Xiaomingshen Village, Jixian County, Songjiang Province, which harvested 5,010 jin per hectare, exceeding the general local wheat yield by more than double.

    The reason why this group of mutual aid teams using new farm tools was able to achieve bumper harvests is mainly because they improved their farming techniques. First, deep plowing. These mutual aid teams using new farm tools generally plowed to a depth of 12 to 18 centimeters (3.3 centimeters equals one inch), which is 3 to 6 centimeters deeper than old-style plowing. This allows for the topsoil and subsoil to be turned over, promoting the restoration of soil fertility and increasing soil fertility. Second, dense sowing. The row spacing of soybeans sown with new farm tools is mostly 60 centimeters, which is 3 to 5 centimeters narrower than the row spacing of old-style farm tools. Third, autumn plowing. In the past, farmers in northern Manchuria rarely had the habit of autumn plowing; now, mutual aid teams in Songjiang, Heilongjiang, and other places generally practice autumn plowing after using new farm tools. Fourth, there have also been improvements in crop rotation, fertilization, and seed selection; in particular, most of these mutual aid teams using new farm tools have adopted the various improved varieties promoted by the government.

    The Department of Agriculture of the Northeast People's Government and public farms in various regions not only give priority to mutual aid teams using new farm tools in providing loans for farm tools, improved seeds, pesticides, etc., but also send technical cadres and tractor drivers to the fields every season to help farmers solve technical problems. This is also a favorable condition for mutual aid teams using new farm tools to achieve bumper harvests.

    东北使用新式农具的互助组获得丰收
    产量远远超过当地一般互助组和个体农民
    据东北人民政府农林部初步调查：今年东北行政区有五十四个互助组，积极参加了爱国主义丰产运动，使用了苏联式马拉农具，改进了耕作技术，因而获得了丰收。松江省集贤县使用新式农具的四十二个互助组的大豆产量，在气候不正常的情况下，每垧（一垧合十五市亩）还收获了三千斤左右，超过当地一般互助组及个体农民产量的一倍。黑龙江省讷河县十四区向阳村马庆福小组，用新式农具耕作，今年种了一百垧小麦，每垧平均收获四千斤，创造了当地小麦高额产量的新纪录。吉林省榆树县兴隆区何家村何凤山互助组，每垧小麦收获三千五百斤，超过当地用旧式犁耕作的小麦产量一千斤。比较突出的是黑龙江省绥化县二区十九村高振互助组的小麦，今年一垧地收了五千四百斤；松江省集贤县小明申村刘文彬小组的小麦，每垧收了五千零一十斤，超过当地一般小麦产量一倍以上。
    这一批使用新式农具的互助组所以能够得到丰收，主要是因为改进了耕作技术。第一、深耕。这些使用新式农具的互助组，在耕作上，一般的都能深耕十二到十八公分（三点三公分等一寸），比旧式犁耕深三公分到六公分，这样就能使表土和下层新土上下翻转，促使地力恢复和增加土壤的肥力。第二、密播。用新式农具播种的大豆株行距离，大部分是六十公分，比旧式农具播种的株行要窄三公分到五公分。第三、秋翻地。过去北满一带的农民，很少有秋翻地的习惯；现在松江、黑龙江等地的互助组使用新式农具后，一般都作到了秋翻地。第四、在轮作、施肥、选种等方面也有改进；特别是这些使用新式农具的互助组，绝大部分都采用了政府推广的各种优良品种。
    东北人民政府农业部和各地公营农场，对于使用新式农具的互助组，不仅优先贷给农具、优良种子、农药等，同时在每个季节还选派技术干部和拖拉机手，深入田间，帮助农民解决技术问题，这也是使用新式农具的互助组得到丰收的有利条件。
