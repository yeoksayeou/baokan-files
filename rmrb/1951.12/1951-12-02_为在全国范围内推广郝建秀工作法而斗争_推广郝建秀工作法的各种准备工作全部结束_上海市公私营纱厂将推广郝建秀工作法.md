The various preparations for promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method have all been completed.
Shanghai's public and private cotton mills will promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    The preparatory phase for promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in Shanghai has concluded, and its comprehensive implementation in all public and private cotton mills citywide is imminent. The East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union jointly convened a citywide meeting of fine yarn worker representatives on the 29th of last month, simultaneously holding a graduation ceremony for the Hao Jianxiu Work Method study class, summarizing past experiences, and conducting ideological mobilization. After gaining typical experience by focusing on promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method at the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Mill in early September, the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union successively held eight "Hao Jianxiu Work Method Study Classes" at the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Mill and Shenxin No. 1 Mill. These classes trained a total of eight hundred and ninety-eight fine yarn workers, technicians, and trade union cadres from seventy public and private textile mills to serve as the core workforce for promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in Shanghai. After returning to their respective factories, the trainees promptly began promotion work. Through this conference, factories will further promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method on the existing foundation. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union issued a "Resolution on Vigorously Promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method," which pointed out: Vigorously promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is a central link in our textile workers' efforts to increase production, practice economy, and combat waste, and it is also a conscious and glorious task for all Shanghai textile workers. Therefore, this conference calls on all Shanghai textile workers to take swift action to learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and work together with the East China Textile Administration Bureau to vigorously promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in all state-owned, public, joint public-private, and private factories in Shanghai, so as to better implement the call to "increase production and practice strict economy" and create more wealth for the country!

    为在全国范围内推广郝建秀工作法而斗争
    推广郝建秀工作法的各种准备工作全部结束
    上海市公私营纱厂将推广郝建秀工作法
    上海市郝建秀工作法推广工作的准备阶段已告结束，即将在全市公私营纱厂中全面推广。华东纺织管理局及中国纺织工会上海市委员会特于上月二十九日召开全市细纱职工代表会议，同时举行郝建秀工作法学习班结业典礼，总结过去经验，并进行思想动员。华东纺织管理局与纺织工会上海市委会于九月初在国营上海第三棉纺织厂重点推广郝建秀工作法，取得典型经验后，即先后在国营上海第三棉纺织厂和申新一厂举办了八期“郝建秀工作法学习班”，培养了包括七十家公私营纺织厂的细纱工人、技术人员和工会干部等共八九八人，作为在上海市推广郝建秀工作法的基本干部。学习班学员回厂后，即先后在各厂进行推广工作。通过这次会议，各厂将在原有的基础上进一步推广郝建秀工作法。与此同时，中国纺织工会上海市委员会发布了“关于大力推广郝建秀工作法的决议”，指出：大力推广郝建秀工作法，正是我们纺织工人开展增产节约和反浪费的中心一环，也是全上海纺织工人自觉的光荣任务。因此，本会议号召全上海纺织工人应该迅速行动起来，学习郝建秀工作法，并与华东纺织管理局共同努力，在全上海各国营、公营、公私合营和私营厂中大力推广郝建秀工作法，以便更好的贯彻“增加生产，厉行节约”的号召，为国家创造更多的财富！
