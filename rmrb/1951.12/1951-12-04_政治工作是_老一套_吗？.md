    Is Political Work "Old Hat"?

    According to a report from Jinan correspondent Lu Li: Wang Tian (a Communist Party member), the director of Jinan Chengda Textile Mill, actually regarded strengthening political study as "old hat" and opposed it. When others criticized his erroneous opinion, he even argued, saying, "Marxism-Leninism can't start a diesel engine." Under his influence of belittling political ideological leadership, in the vigorous movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the output and quality of cloth in the factory not only did not improve, but declined; workshop accidents occurred frequently, with fourteen incidents in April alone.

    Comrade Wang Tian is a Party economic worker, but he did not carry out his work from the principled standpoint of the Party. He thought that advocating technical study was equivalent to giving up political study, so he called political study "old hat" and discarded it. This is obviously wrong. He did not realize that our economic work is for the purpose of consolidating the New Democratic system at present, and establishing a beautiful socialist and communist society in the future. Therefore, Party economic workers must have a broad political vision, so that all their work can be built on the basis of wholeheartedly serving the people; so that they can care for and educate the workers in their enterprise departments a hundred times more, rely on them to do a good job in production; so that they will not be satisfied with the production achievements they have already obtained, and so that they will be good at educating technical personnel, so that their technology can truly serve politics, thereby ensuring the complete realization of the national economic construction plan. Can such political work be said to be "old hat"? No!

    People with a purely technical viewpoint do not understand these principles, and we must oppose purely technical viewpoints and eliminate the erroneous ideas of neglecting politics and not asking about politics. The task of Party economic workers is to closely combine production technology and business management with politics, so that their work is more in line with the needs of national construction.

### 政治工作是“老一套”吗？

    政治工作是“老一套”吗？
    据济南通讯员陆力报道：济南成大纱厂主任王田
    （共产党员）竟把加强政治学习看成是“老一套”，加以反对。当别人批评他这种错误的意见时，他还强辩，说什么“马列主义可不能开柴油机呵”。在他轻政治的思想领导之下，该厂在轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动中，纱布产量与质量，不仅没有提高，反而降低了；车间事故，层出不穷，仅四月份即发生十四起。
    王田同志是党的经济工作人员，但是他没有站在党的原则立场上来进行工作。他以为提倡学习技术，就等于放弃学习政治，因此把政治学习叫做“老一套”，而把它扔开。这显然是错误的。他没有认识到我们的经济工作，是为了在目前巩固新民主主义制度，在将来建立美好的社会主义社会和共产主义社会。因此党的经济工作人员，必须具有远大的政治眼光，才会把自己的全部工作，建筑在全心全意为人民服务的基础上；才会对本企业部门的工人百倍地关怀，教育他们，依靠他们搞好生产；才会不满足于已得的生产成绩，才会善于教育技术人员，使他们的技术真正能够为政治服务，从而保证国家经济建设计划的完满实现。这样的政治工作能够说是“老一套”吗？不能！
    有单纯技术观点的人，却不懂得这些道理，我们必须反对单纯技术观点，肃清忽视政治、不问政治的错误思想。党的经济工作人员的任务，就是把生产技术和业务管理同政治密切结合起来，使自己的工作，更加符合于国家建设的需要。
