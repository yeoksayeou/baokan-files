Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 30th: Since the Korean armistice negotiations entered the discussion of the third agenda item, our side has strictly followed the provisions of the third agenda item and put forward five principles and suggestions, stipulating the specific arrangements for the ceasefire, the specific arrangements for both sides to respect the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, and the specific arrangements for the establishment of an agency to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire and armistice clauses. Our five principles and suggestions are a sufficient and reasonable solution to the third agenda item. However, the other side insisted on maintaining the balance of military forces between the two sides at the time of the signing of the armistice agreement, and that the supervisory agency should have unlimited freedom to enter and exit all parts of Korea. On the one hand, the other side claimed to advocate that neither side should increase troops and military equipment from outside Korea; but on the other hand, it demanded that "necessary replenishment and replacement" of foreign troops and equipment should be allowed. On the one hand, the other side claimed that the armistice negotiations were a strict military armistice conference and should not involve political issues; on the other hand, it advocated restricting the construction of military facilities and insisted that the supervisory agency should have the right to freely inspect all parts of Korea, directly interfering in the other side's internal affairs. On the one hand, the other side emphasized that the military armistice must provide adequate guarantees for the safety of both sides' troops; on the other hand, it demanded to continue occupying the islands in the rear of our side, placing our sea under artillery blockade, and posing a direct threat to the rear of our side. Our representative pointed out sternly at the delegation meeting on November 30th that the other side's so-called suggestion to restrict the increase of military equipment was in fact aimed at preventing the post-war reconstruction and revitalization of Korea. The so-called suggestion of free inspection throughout Korea is in fact aimed at further directly interfering in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The so-called suggestion of necessary replenishment and replacement of foreign troops and equipment is in fact aimed at continuing to import troops and equipment from outside Korea. Since there is an armistice, why should new troops and military supplies and equipment be transported in? If no shots are fired, why replenish ammunition? If there is no war, why replace troops? Furthermore, how can we distinguish between troops and equipment and supplies imported from outside Korea as "necessary replenishment and replacement" and not as an increase in military strength and supply equipment? Now that the military demarcation line has been determined and it has been agreed to cease all hostile acts, why refuse to withdraw from the coastal islands and sea in the rear of our side, bounded by the military demarcation line, and attempt to allow hostile acts to break out again at any time? Our representative pointed out that unless the other side intends to delay the negotiations or has other purposes, the other side has no reason to insist on these unreasonable and unfeasible methods, and should quickly reach a principled agreement on the parts of the two sides' plans that have already been agreed and may be agreed upon, and agree on detailed provisions, so that the conference can quickly enter the fourth agenda item, the discussion of the issue of prisoners of war.

    在昨日双方代表团会议上
    我揭露美方无理要求的卑鄙目的
    【新华社开城三十日电】自从朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会进入了第三项议程的讨论后，我方即严格按照第三项议程的规定提出五项原则建议，规定了停火的具体安排，双方尊重军事分界线与非军事区的具体安排，以及设立监督停火休战条款实施机构的具体安排。我方的五项原则建议，是解决第三项议程的充分而合理的方案。但对方却坚持维持停战协议签字时双方军事力量的平衡要求，监督机构得以无限制的自由出入朝鲜的一切部分。对方一方面声称，主张双方不得自朝鲜境外增加军队和军事装备；但另一方面却又要求应该允许外国军队和装备的“必要的补充和替换”。对方一方面声称，停战谈判是严格的军事停战会议，不应涉及政治问题；而另一方面却又主张限制军事设备的修建，坚持监督机构应该有权到朝鲜所有的地方自由视察，直接干涉对方的内政。对方一方面强调军事停战必须对双方部队的安全作适当的保证；另一方面却又要求继续占领我方后方的岛屿置我方海面于炮火封锁之内，对我方的后方进行直接的威胁。我方代表在十一月三十日的代表团大会上严词指出，对方所谓限制军事设备的增加的建议，其真正的目的只是在于阻止战后朝鲜的重建与复兴。所谓在朝鲜全境自由视察的建议，其真正的目的只是在于进而直接干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政。所谓外国军队和装备的必要补充与替换的建议，其真正的目的只是在于继续自朝鲜境外输入部队和装备。既然停战，为什么还要运进新的部队与军事供应和装备？既不放枪，何需弹药补充？既不打仗，何需部队替换？更又有什么办法区别从朝鲜境外输入的部队和装备及供应是“必要的补充与替换”，而不是军事力量与供应装备的增加？既已确定军事分界线，并同意停止一切敌对行为，何以又拒绝以军事分界线为界撤出我方后方的沿海岛屿与海面，而企图使敌对行为随时得以再度爆发？我方代表指出，除非对方有意拖延谈判或别有目的，对方就没有任何理由坚持这些不合理、不可行的办法，而应该就双方方案中已经同意和可能取得同意的部分，迅速达成原则协议，并商定细节的规定，使大会得以迅速进入第四项议程关于俘虏问题的讨论。
