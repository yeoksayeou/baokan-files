Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Worker's Daily", reported from Panmunjom on the 2nd: The weekend has passed again, and no agreement has been reached here. However, it is now clear what the four main points of contention are that are preventing the resolution of the third agenda item. These four points are:

(1) The US side demands that the airfields on the Korean-Chinese side maintain their status quo during the armistice. The US side itself has admitted that the Korean-Chinese side has newly built several airfields in North Korea in the past period, and admits that these airfields are the main means of protecting the Korean people and army from the indiscriminate bombing of the US Air Force. However, the US side completely ignores the facts they themselves admitted and demands that the Korean-Chinese side stop the work of building airfields. General Nam Il told them: "The Korean people must repair and strengthen their airfields during the armistice to prevent further indiscriminate bombing by your side and to ensure the safety of our armed forces." The Korean-Chinese side believes that this issue is an internal affair and an indisputable right for the Korean people to defend themselves.

(2) The US side demands the right to freely enter and exit various parts of Korea for ulterior motives. They demand the right to conduct aerial photography and reconnaissance. The People's Air Force has now made it impossible for them to conduct aerial reconnaissance, so they want to make up for this deficiency. They even demand the right to conduct aerial reconnaissance in the airspace bordering third countries and the right to move freely on various transportation lines. The Korean-Chinese side hopes to conduct supervision limited to ensuring the implementation of the armistice conditions.

(3) The US side, under the guise of maintaining the current level of troops, demands the right to send new troops to replace their existing tired troops. They hope to withdraw the wounded, war-weary soldiers, broken trucks, and inefficient aircraft, and replace them with new troops, new trucks, and the latest jet aircraft. They are worried about the low morale of their troops and therefore hope to maintain their rotation system and transport new troops to replenish them. Why do they want to do this? The answer may be to fight again. The Korean-Chinese side's attitude on this issue is also very clear. No new foreign soldiers are allowed to enter Korea, and this applies to both sides. The best thing, of course, is to get all foreign troops out, and at least no new troops should be allowed to come in.

(4) The US side hopes to occupy the islands north of the demarcation line agreed upon by both sides, with the obvious purpose of creating an unstable armistice. The Korean-Chinese side believes that the demarcation line is valid for land, sea, and air forces. They said: According to the agreement on the second agenda item, all troops on the other side must withdraw from the islands behind the Korean-Chinese side to ensure a reliable armistice.

These are the main issues being debated in the glass-windowed conference tent in Panmunjom at this moment. All these difficulties are created by the US side. Apart from the US side's unreasonable demands, everything necessary for this agenda item has been agreed upon. Agreement has been reached on the time and method of ceasing combat, the establishment of a committee to supervise the implementation of the agreed-upon conditions, the withdrawal of troops from both sides from the demarcation line, and the supervision of the demilitarized zone. The US demands go far beyond the scope of a military armistice and cause suspicious entanglements. If the US side abandons this demand, this agenda item could be agreed upon tomorrow. The US side has made all these demands in order to interfere indefinitely in the internal affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and to obtain military benefits to carry out its ulterior motives.

### 英国“工人日报”记者报道：第三项议程的主要分歧点都是美方无理制造的困难

    英国“工人日报”记者报道：
    第三项议程的主要分歧点都是美方无理制造的困难
    【新华社三日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿二日自板门店报道：周末又过去了，此地还没有取得协议。但是，无论如何，现在已经判明了使第三项议程不能解决的四个主要的分歧点是什么。这四点是：
    （一）美方要求朝中方面的机场在停战期间维持现状。美方自己也曾承认，朝中方面在过去一段时间内已在北朝鲜新修了若干飞机场，并且承认这些飞机场是保护朝鲜人民和军队、使他们免受美国空军滥炸的主要手段，但是，美方完全不顾他们自己所承认的事实，竟要求朝中方面停止修建机场的工作。南日将军对他们说：“朝鲜人民在停战期间一定要修复和加强他们的机场，以便阻止你方的进一步的滥炸，并保障我们武装部队的安全。”朝中方面认为这个问题是内政问题，是朝鲜人民应有的保卫自己的不容争辩的权利。
    （二）美方为了不可告人的目的而要求有自由出入朝鲜各地的权利。他们要求有进行空中摄影和侦察的权利。人民空军现在已经使他们无法进行空中侦察了，所以他们想要弥补这个缺陷。他们甚至要求取得在牵连到第三国的边境上空进行空中侦察的权利以及在各种交通线上自由行动的权利。朝中方面希望进行限于保证执行停战条件的监督。
    （三）美方以维持目前军队的水平做幌子，要求有权派新军队来代替他们现有的疲惫的军队。他们希望抽掉伤员、厌战的士兵、破卡车、效能低下的飞机，而代之以新军队、新卡车和最新式的喷气飞机。他们担心他们的军队士气低落，因而希望维持他们的轮换制，运新军队来补充。为什么要这样做呢？答复也许是再打。朝中方面对这个问题的态度也是很清楚的。不准一名新的外国士兵进入朝鲜，双方都是如此。最好当然是使一切外国军队都离开，至少不能让新军队开进来。
    （四）美方希望占领双方一致同意的分界线以北的岛屿，目的显然是要造成不稳的停战；朝中方面认为分界线对陆、海、空军都是有效的。他们说：根据第二项议程协议，对方的一切军队必须从朝中方面后方的岛屿撤退，以保证可靠的停战。
    这就是此刻在板门店的装有玻璃窗的会议帐篷中争辩的主要问题。这一切困难都是美方制造的。除了美方的无理要求以外，这项议程所必需的一切都已经取得协议。关于停止战斗的时间和办法、成立委员会以监督已经取得协议的条件的执行、双方军队撤离分界线和监督非军事区——这一切双方都已经取得协议。美方的要求远远超出军事停战范围以外，并且引起了可疑的纠葛。如果美方放弃这种要求的话，这项议程在明天就可以取得协议。美方之所以提出这一切要求，为的是想无限期地干涉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的内政，并取得军事利益，干它的不可告人的勾当。
