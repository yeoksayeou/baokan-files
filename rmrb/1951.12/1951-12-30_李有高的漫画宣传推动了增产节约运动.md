    Li Yougao's Cartoon Propaganda Promotes the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
      Zhao Kai
    Li Yougao is the leader of the electrician and fitter team at the Taixin Mine in the Xi'an Mining Area of Liaoxi Province. After becoming a propagandist, he organized a cartoon group. Initially, there were only two people, but it later grew to five. When it was first organized, everyone thought, "Drawing is a delicate matter; we workers are clumsy, so it won't work." He encouraged everyone, "Let's practice slowly. If we don't draw well, it's enough to explain the matter." This year on May Day, they imitated the anti-American and aid-Korea comic strips in the newspaper and drew propaganda posters for the first time, which were welcomed by their co-workers and praised by the leadership, boosting everyone's confidence.
    During the quality inspection campaign, they collected facts about the losses caused by poor product quality in their factory, drew 78 cartoons, and held a small cartoon exhibition with detailed explanations. For example, one of the exhibits was a series of eight cartoons depicting a wind pump. Because a screw was loose, the person watching the machine didn't check it, resulting in an accident and damage to the machine. Later, due to incomplete repairs, another accident occurred, causing the state a loss equivalent to more than 320 tons of sorghum. The picture noted that if this wealth were used to support the Volunteers, it would be enough for 10,000 people to eat for 32 days. After seeing the cartoons, the workers immediately connected their work with the anti-American and aid-Korea effort. Co-workers often said at work, "Don't forget the quality inspection exhibition!" Because the workers worked hard to study, the number of products with poor quality was reduced by half.
    After the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign started, Li Yougao led the cartoon group again to draw cartoons based on the masses' thoughts. For example, one painting illustrated the waste in machine operation. He drew two planers, which only needed a five-horsepower electric roller, but used twenty horsepower. Another painting, with the theme "Dead Machine Resurrected," praised electrician Gao Jin for transforming an unusable air pump into an electric air pump. After the group formulated an increase production and practice economy plan, he drew five types of charts based on the situation of the fitter team, including attendance rate, product quality, implementation of the patriotic pact, and political study. The charts were accompanied by pictures. For example, one chart showed a map of Korea, divided into many small squares, with a person standing in the middle of each square carrying a shell. Anyone who did not produce any rework or have any accidents for a day would move forward one square to see who would deliver the shells to Korea first. These charts inspired the workers' enthusiasm for production. Every day when they went to and from work, they ran to the charts to see where they were and strive to be the first to reach Korea. As a result, the attendance rate of the fitter team reached 100% in September. Rework was reduced from 15 pieces in August to 4 pieces in September.

    李有高的漫画宣传推动了增产节约运动
      赵铠
    李有高是辽西省西安矿区泰信矿工电科钳工组组长。他担任宣传员以后，组织了一个漫画小组。最初只有两个人，后来发展到五个人。刚组织时大家以为：“画画是个细致事，咱们工人粗手重脚那行。”他就鼓励大家：“咱们慢慢练习，画不好，能说明事就行。”今年“五一”节，他们仿照报纸上的抗美援朝连环画，第一次绘出了宣传画，受到了工友们的欢迎和领导方面的称赞，大家的信心就高了。
    在质量检查运动中，他们搜集了本厂因产品质量差造成损失的事实，画了七十八幅漫画，加上详细的说明，举办了一个小型漫画展览会。例如，展览的画里有一套八幅的连环画，描写一个风泵，因为一个螺丝钉松了，看机器的人没有检查出来，结果出了事故，碰坏了机器；后来又因为修理不彻底，又出了事故：给国家造成了等于三百二十多吨高粱米的损失。画上注明：如果把这笔财富用来支援志愿军，足够一万人吃三十二天。工人们看了连环画，马上联想到自己的工作和抗美援朝的关系。工友们在工作时常说：“别忘了质量检查展览会啊！”因为工人们努力钻研，质量不好的产品减少了一半。
    增产节约运动开展以后，李有高又领导漫画小组，根据群众的思想情况来绘制漫画。例如，有一幅画是说明机器运用上的浪费情形，他画了两台刨床，本来只需要五匹马力的电滚，但用了二十匹马力。另一幅是以“死机复活”为主题，表扬了电工高津把一个不能用的气风泵，改装为电力风泵的创造。小组中订出了增产节约计划后，他又根据钳工组的情况，绘制了出勤率、产品质量、爱国公约的执行情况、政治学习等五种图表，表上都配有图画。比如，有一个图表上画着朝鲜地图，四周分成许多小格，每格中间站着一个人扛着炮弹，谁要是一天不出返工活、没有事故，谁就前进一格，看谁先把炮弹送到朝鲜去。这些图表，鼓舞了工人们的生产热情。他们每天上下班时，都跑到图表前去看看自己走到那里了，争取首先跑到朝鲜。这样，钳工组的出勤率，在九月份达到了百分之百。返工活从八月份的十五件减低到九月份的四件。
