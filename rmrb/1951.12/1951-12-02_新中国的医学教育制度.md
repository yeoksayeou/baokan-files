The New Medical Education System of New China
    Gao Changguo

    The founding of the People's Republic of China has opened up broad avenues for the development of the new China's health and medical undertakings.

    In order to meet the urgent needs of the country's current health construction, the old medical education principles, content, and methods must be thoroughly reformed so that graduates can become useful talents for the country's health construction. At the same time, medical and pharmaceutical colleges must be strengthened and classrooms and laboratories expanded to accommodate a large number of students and train more medical and health personnel.

    After thorough deliberation and careful discussion at the Higher Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government last year, the First National Health Conference convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission finally determined in August last year that medical education must adhere to the general health policy of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, prioritizing prevention, and uniting Chinese and Western medicine." It was determined that medical education should be divided into three levels: higher, intermediate, and primary, and that the practical teaching method of integrating theory and practice should be adopted.

    Regarding Higher Medical Education

    Last year's National Health Conference decided to abolish the old system of higher medical schools not being divided into specialized subjects, which was not in line with practical needs, shorten the length of study, and adopt a specialized key-point system: Medical colleges (departments) were divided into several departments, of which the study period for the four departments of internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics was five years (the last six months being specialized internship); the study period for ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and dermatology and venereology was four years (the last six months being specialized internship); the Department of Public Health was established as a college or department, set at four years; the Department of Stomatology and the College (Department) of Pharmacy were also uniformly set at four years, the same as the length of general universities. The College (Department) of Pharmacy was divided into five departments (specialties): pharmaceutics, pharmaceutical chemistry, medicinal botany, analytical testing, and pharmaceutical engineering. When conditions permit, each department (specialty) will enroll students separately. In order to meet practical needs, specialized courses such as medicine, pharmacy, public health, and stomatology were established in medical and pharmaceutical colleges. Referring to the experience of the Northeast region, the specialized key-point system was adopted, all set to graduate in two years, with an additional six-month internship for medical specialties and public health.

    As a result of increasing faculty and equipment, and greatly increasing student enrollment and the addition of specialized courses, the total number of medical students in school nationwide in June of this year exceeded the number of doctors trained in the past 69 years. Furthermore, as a result of the reform of the school system in medical schools in the Northeast region, the number of graduates in 1950 was equal to five times the number of graduates in 1930.

    Regarding the specialized key-point system and the practical teaching method. The emergence of the specialized key-point system was not accidental; it went through a certain stage of development. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, medical education plans were formulated based on the needs of the revolutionary war to train a large number of military doctors; key-point education developed into specialized key-point education.

    In order to compare the merits of the old education system and the new specialized key-point system, an examination was held in the Northeast region in September 1948. Graduates from the China Medical University and students from three medical colleges that followed the old system participated in the examination. The results showed that the average scores of the graduates from the China Medical University were higher than those of the students from the other three colleges [Note 1]. Therefore, it was decided to adopt the specialized key-point system at that time.

    The specialized key-point system is an educational system that opposes egalitarianism. It is an educational system with prominent key points. It divides courses into major and minor, with major courses being the focus of the curriculum. Therefore, it has the advantages of a general education system, and at the same time, it has characteristics that a general education system cannot have. Moreover, it can be consistent with the national construction plan, so it is a planned and purposeful education system.

    The specialized key-point system adds appropriate specialization on the basis of systematic scientific knowledge. It takes the principle of scientific basic knowledge serving clinical practice and clinical practice serving practical needs as the principle for formulating teaching plans, teaching outlines, and teaching content for each subject, in order to achieve the unity of theory and practice, so that students can independently undertake specialized medical work after graduation.

    Adopting the specialized key-point system requires reforming teaching methods, which means that the practical teaching method must be used in order to achieve the goal of shortening time and emphasizing quality.

    The practical teaching method enables students to combine theory and practice in lectures, observations, and internships, and at the same time, systematically inspire students to discover and solve problems. Therefore, this teaching method can improve students' attention and thinking ability, and systematically improve students' internship results. In principle, the practical teaching method shortens the distance between theory and observation or operation; however, it is also necessary to pay attention to ensuring that students have systematic knowledge.

    This teaching method is basically in line with scientific principles, but it must also be used flexibly so that students have the opportunity to develop analytical, judgment, and creative abilities in the learning process. At the same time, specimens, charts, notes, handouts, etc. must be improved, and attention must be paid to the organization of teaching and research.

    In terms of teaching organization, the specialized teaching group is part of the new teaching system and is the basic-level organization of teaching. Organizationally, it ensures the continuous improvement and enrichment of the practical teaching method and plays a role in training and improving faculty. It is composed of departments and includes all professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, graduate students, and other teaching staff within the department. Under the leadership of the department head, they engage in teaching research and conduct mutual class observations, etc., in order to improve teaching effectiveness and enrich teaching content.

    Regarding Intermediate Medical Education

    Intermediate health workers are the bridge for improving and popularizing national medical and health work. The National Health Conference has decided to develop intermediate medical education as the primary task of current health work, with medical assistant education being the primary task of intermediate medical education. The length of study for medical assistant schools is stipulated as two years (with an additional six-month internship), and some have been shortened to one year (such as Inner Mongolia) or one and a half years (such as Central South and Northwest). The Central South region also adopts a segmented teaching system, that is, students can participate in work after each stage of the course is completed. Anyone with a junior high school diploma can apply for medical assistant schools. The content of each course focuses on health care and disease prevention, supplemented by treatment; in areas with serious endemic or epidemic diseases, the course focuses on the prevention and treatment of such diseases. Medical assistant education has developed rapidly. At the end of last year, there were only 23 medical assistant departments in medical assistant schools and health schools nationwide, but by June of this year, that number had increased to 91.

    In the past, the school systems of nursing schools and midwifery schools were extremely inconsistent: some recruited junior high school graduates, with a length of study of three or two and a half years; some recruited high school graduates, with a length of study of three years; and in the case of nursing schools, some recruited pre-nursing students, with a length of study of three years. Now, all nursing or midwifery schools uniformly recruit junior high school graduates for a two-year program; schools with better faculty and equipment may, with the approval of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, establish specialized nursing or midwifery courses, recruiting high school graduates for a two-year program.

    In the past, there were no complete statistics on pharmacy technicians, laboratory technicians, vital statistics clerks, and environmental health workers. According to statistics from May 1951, there are currently 17 secondary pharmacy schools and training classes nationwide (4 privately run schools, 12 affiliated training classes), with 1,279 students. There are 7 laboratory technician training classes, with 260 students; 4 epidemic prevention personnel training classes, with 248 students; 2 public health personnel training classes, with 94 students; and 1 X-ray technician training class, with 113 students. Most of the above schools (classes) are newly established, and the length of study is stipulated as six months to two years, depending on the nature of the discipline. The admission qualifications are the same as those for medical assistants. In addition, the Central People's Government's Ministry of Health directly supervised short-term public health, epidemic prevention, BCG vaccination, vital statistics, nutrition, health care, clinical laboratory, and other intermediate personnel training courses, which were held for a total of 12 sessions last year and are continuing this year [Note 2].

    Regarding Primary Medical Education

    The training of grassroots health workers cannot be ignored. Maternal and child health workers (6 months of study) and village health workers (3 months of study) are new health popularization workers, and they are trained by the health centers of each county; nurse assistants (6 months of study) are trained by nursing schools or hospitals, and the qualifications for application are uniformly junior elementary school graduation or equivalent education.

    The reform of the medical education system is an arduous and long-term task. In the beginning, it was opposed by some people. However, the new medical education system was created from revolutionary practice. It is a great reform that truly combines the current needs of the broad masses of the people and will surely be supported by everyone. The growing and improving of my country's new medical education system will cultivate more medical and health workers for the new China.

    [Note 1] In the basic course section, the average score of students from the China Medical University was 83.7 points, while the average score of students from old-system medical colleges was only 20.7 points; in the clinical course, the former averaged 82.1 points, while the latter averaged only 17.8 points. [Note 2] In addition, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government directly led the establishment of specialized short-term training courses in various colleges and universities in Beijing for graduates to continue their studies, such as radiology technology and machinery repair classes, thoracic surgeon classes, and plague prevention classes.

    新中国的医学教育制度
    高昌国
    中华人民共和国的成立，为新中国的卫生医学事业开辟了广阔的发展道路。
    为了适应目前国家卫生建设的迫切需要，旧的医学教育原则、内容和方法，必须加以彻底改革，使毕业的学生都能成为国家卫生建设的有用人材。同时，必须把医药院校充实起来，扩大课室和实验室，以便容纳大量的学生，培养更多的医药卫生人材。
    经过充分的酝酿和去年中央人民政府教育部所召开的高等教育会议的慎重讨论，终于在去年八月中央人民政府卫生部及人民革命军事委员会卫生部召集的第一届全国卫生会议中，确定了医学教育必须服从“面向工农兵、预防为主和团结中西医”的卫生总方针。确定了医学教育分为高、中、初三级制，采用理论与实际一致的实际教学法。
    关于高级医学教育
    去年全国卫生会议决定废弃高级医学校不分科的不合实际需要的旧制，缩短学习年限，改用分科重点制：医学院（系）分设若干科，其中内、外、妇产、小儿四科学习期限为五年（最后半年为专科实习）；眼科、耳鼻喉科及皮肤花柳科学习期限为四年（最后半年为专科实习）；公共卫生科建立为学院或学系。定为四年制；口腔医学系及药学院（系）亦一律为四年制，与一般大学的年限相同。在药学院（系）中分为药剂学、药物化学、生药学、分析检定学、制药工程学等五系（科），以上各系科在条件可能时均单独招生。并为配合实际需要起见，在医药院校设立医药、公共卫生、口腔专修科等专修科，参照东北地区的经验运用分科重点制，均定为二年毕业，其中医学各科及公共卫生科增加实习期六个月。
    增加师资、设备，大量招收学生及添设专修科的结果，今年六月全国在校医学生总数，超过了过去六十九年来所训练出来的医生数。又因东北地区医学校改革学制的结果，一九五○年的毕业学生已等于一九三○年毕业学生的五倍。
    关于分科重点制和实际教学法问题。分科重点制的由来不是偶然的，它曾经过了一定的发展阶段。在第二次国内革命战争时期、抗日战争时期和第三次国内革命战争时期，曾根据革命战争的需要，制订了医学教育计划，培养大批的军医；由重点教育，发展为分科重点教育。
    为了比较旧的教育制度与新的分科重点制的优劣，在一九四八年九月间曾在东北举行过一次考试，参加考试的有中国医科大学的毕业生，和沿用旧学制的三个医学院的学生，考试的结果是中国医科大学毕业生的平均分数都较其他三个校院的学生为高〔注一〕。因此，在那时就决定采用分科重点制。
    分科重点制是反对平均主义的教育制度，是一种重点突出的教育制度，它将课程分为主科和辅科，以主科为课程的重点。因此它具有一般教育制度的优点，同时也具有一般教育制度所不能有的特点，而且能与国家建设计划配合一致，所以它是有计划、有目的的教育制度。
    分科重点制是在系统的科学知识基础上，加以适当的专业化，它是以科学基础知识服从临床实习，临床实习服从现实需要为原则，以此原则订立各科的教学计划、教学纲要和教学内容，以达到理论与实际一致，使学生于毕业后能独立担任专科医疗工作为目的。
    采用分科重点制，同时必须改革教学方法，这就是说，必须运用实际教学法，才能达到缩短时间及质量并重的目的。
    实际教学法可使学生在听讲、观察和实习中能将理论和实际结合，并同时有计划地启发学生发现问题、解决问题。因此这种教学法能够提高学生的注意力和思考力，而且有系统地提高学生的实习效果。实际教学法在原则上是使理论与观察或操作之间的距离缩短；但是也须注意到使学生具有系统知识。
    这样的教学法基本上是合乎科学原则的，但也要灵活运用，以使学生在学习过程中获得发挥分析力、判断力和创造力的机会。同时，在标本、图表、笔记、讲义等等方面必须予以改进，并注意教学的组织和研究等等。
    在教学组织方面，专科教学小组是新的教学系统中的一部分，是教学的基层组织。它在组织上保证不断改进与充实实际教学法，并起着培养和提高师资的作用。它是以系科为单位组成的，包括系科内所有的教授、讲师、助教、研究生等等教学人员。他们在系科主任领导下从事教学研究，进行互相听课等等工作，以提高教学效果和丰富教学内容。
        关于中级医学教育
    中级卫生工作人员是提高和普及全国医药卫生工作的桥梁。全国卫生会议已决定以发展中级医学教育为当前卫生工作的首要任务，而中级医学教育中又以医士教育为首要。医士学校的修业期限规定为二年制（可增加六个月的实习期），也有缩短为一年的（如内蒙）或一年半的（如中南和西北），在中南区尚有采用分段教学制的，即是在课程每告一段落后，即可参加工作。医士学校凡有初中毕业生学历者即可投考，每种课程的内容，均以保健防疫为主，治疗为辅；有严重地方病或流行病的地区，其课程即以该种疾病的防治为重点。医士教育发展很快，去年年底，全国的医士学校和卫生学校中的医士科只有二十三个，但到了今年六月，即增加到九十一个。
    过去护士学校和助产学校的学制极不统一：有的招收初中毕业生，修业期限为三年或两年半；有的招收高中毕业生，修业期限为三年；在护士学校方面有的招收护预科学生，修业期限为三年。现在所有护士或助产学校均一律招收初中毕业生，二年毕业；师资和设备较好的学校，经中央人民政府教育部及中央人民政府卫生部批准后，得设立护士或助产专修科，招收高中毕业生，二年毕业。
    药剂员、检验员、生命统计员、环境卫生员等过去向无完整的统计数字。据一九五一年五月统计，全国现有中等药剂学校及训练班十七所（私人开办的学校四所，附设训练班十二班），学生一千二百七十九人。检验班七所，学生二百六十人；防疫人员训练班四所，学生二百四十八人；公共卫生人员训练班二所，学生九十四人；爱克斯光技术员训练班一所，学生一百一十三人。以上各校（班）绝大部分都是新设的，根据学科的性质，分别规定六个月至二年的学习期限，入学资格与医士相同。其他如中央人民政府卫生部直接指导的短期公共卫生防疫、卡介苗接种、生命统计、营养、保健、临床检验等中级人员训练班在去年共办过十二期，今年仍在继续办理中〔注二〕。
    关于初级医学教育
    培养基层的卫生工作人员是不容忽视的。妇幼保健员（六个月毕业）和村卫生员（三个月毕业），都是新的卫生普及工作者，他们由各县卫生院主持训练；护士助理员（六个月毕业）的训练，由护士学校或医院兼办，投考的资格一律为高小毕业或具有同等学力者。
    医学教育制度的改革是一件艰苦而长期的工作。在开始时，它曾遭受过一部分人的反对。但新的医学教育制度是从革命的实践中创造出来的，它是真正结合着广大人民目前需要而提出的伟大改革，一定会得到大家的拥护。我国新医学教育制度的日益成长与完善，将为新中国培养更多的医药卫生工作人员。
    〔注一〕基础课程部分，中国医科大学学生平均得八三·七分，旧制医学院校学生平均仅二○·七分；临床课程前者平均得八二·一分，后者平均仅一七·八分。〔注二〕另在北京各院校内由中央卫生部直接领导开办了供毕业生继续进修的专业化短期训练班，如放射学科技术及机械修理班、胸部外科医师班、鼠疫防治班等等。
