    Communist Party Members Should Resolutely Enforce the Marriage Law
    The reports of some Communist Party members in Hebei Province and certain Communist Party members in Wuhe Village in the suburbs of Beijing interfering with freedom of marriage illustrate that some Party members in local Party organizations still possess strong feudal ideas and engage in barbaric and illegal behaviors that disregard Party discipline and the law. This is completely contrary to the principles of the Party.
    Why can such thoughts and behaviors exist within our Party organizations? The reason for this must be sought in the leadership of certain Party organizations. In Mengzhuang, Yutian County, Hebei Province, a woman was murdered, and the County Democratic Women's Federation requested that the matter be handled according to the law. The County Party Committee actually criticized the County Women's Federation for "lacking class stand." They one-sidedly emphasized that this was "a matter within the people," as if it should not or need not be handed over to the government for legal handling, otherwise it would be "lacking class stand." Under the dominance of this erroneous thought, they would naturally not take effective measures to correct and prevent the feudal ideas and the illegal behaviors of abusing and murdering women and interfering with freedom of marriage among Party members and the masses, but would adopt an attitude of appeasement and indulgence. Some also emphasized that a certain person has always been active in their work and loyal to the Party, so they would not strictly correct this Party member's erroneous thoughts and behaviors, and would be unwilling to hand them over to the government for legal sanctions even if they violated the law. This makes some Party members feel that as long as they are active in their work and loyal to the Party, it doesn't matter if they make a mistake or even break the law in some aspect.
    Another situation is that they emphasize being busy with work and relax the promotion of the Marriage Law, so that many Party members do not even know that our Party has always advocated freedom of marriage and equality between men and women, and do not know that arranged marriages and interference with freedom of marriage are illegal. They blindly and stubbornly call the legitimate love and free marriage of young men and women "incorrect male-female relationships"; they call women who bravely fight back and demand divorce because they cannot bear abuse "indecent"; female Party members who demand divorce or free marriage are considered to be detrimental to the Party's honor and "have a bad influence," and are even mistakenly given disciplinary actions such as dismissal from work and expulsion from the Party.
    All of these are absolutely unacceptable errors for us Communist Party members who take the liberation of all mankind and the liberation of all women as our responsibility. The Central Committee of our Party stated in the notice to the entire Party on ensuring the implementation of the Marriage Law: "All Party members should unanimously support and abide by this Marriage Law, ... and ensure its correct implementation. Party committees at all levels must take appropriate measures to mobilize and organize Party members to educate the broad masses to publicize and explain the Marriage Law, so that the Marriage Law becomes a legal document that is well known and happily implemented among the masses. Communist Party members who work directly in the marriage registration organs and judicial organs of the People's Government, as well as Communist Party members who work in women's organizations and youth organizations, should play an active role in the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law." The correct attitude of Communist Party members towards the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China stipulated here must be strictly observed by all Party organizations and Party members without exception and must not be violated. The same notice also stated: "If a Communist Party member interferes with the freedom of marriage between men and women, and if the interfered person is injured or dies as a result of the interference with the freedom of marriage, they will not only bear civil and criminal responsibility and be subject to state legal sanctions, but will first be subject to Party disciplinary sanctions." Party committees at all levels must educate all Party members according to this regulation so that they can understand its significance. Party organizations at all levels must impose sanctions on Party members who have already engaged in illegal interference with freedom of marriage in accordance with this regulation, and there should be no appeasement or leniency whatsoever.

### 共产党员应坚决执行婚姻法

    共产党员应坚决执行婚姻法
    河北省部分共产党员和北京郊区五合村某些共产党员干涉婚姻自由的报道，说明各地党组织内还有部分党员有着浓厚的封建思想和无视党纪、法纪的野蛮犯法行为。这和党的原则是完全背道而驰的。
    为什么这样的思想和行为竟能够在我们的党组织内存在呢？这须要从某些党组织的领导上找寻原因。河北省玉田县孟庄有一妇女被杀，县民主妇女联合会要求依法处理。县委竟批评县妇联会“没有阶级立场”。他们片面强调这是“人民内部的事情”，似乎这就不应该或不必要交由政府依法处理，否则就是“没有阶级立场”。在这种错误思想支配下，他们对党员和群众中的封建思想和虐待、杀害妇女以及干涉婚姻自由的违法行为，当然就不会采取有效的办法加以纠正与制止，而采取了姑息与放纵的态度。有的还强调某人工作一贯积极，对党一贯忠实，于是对这个党员的错误思想行为就不加严格纠正，犯了法也不愿交由政府给予法律制裁。这样就使得某些党员觉得只要工作积极，对党忠实，在某一方面犯个错误甚至犯法，都没有什么。
    另外一种情形，是强调工作忙，放松对婚姻法的宣传，以致许多党员甚至不知道我们党是一贯主张婚姻自由和男女平等的，不知道包办婚姻和干涉婚姻自由是犯法的。他们盲目固执地把青年男女的正当恋爱和自由结婚称为“不正确的男女关系”；把因为不堪虐待而奋起斗争、要求离婚的妇女称为“不正派的”；女党员要求离婚或自由结婚，即被认为有碍党的荣誉，“影响不好”，甚至因此错误地给予撤销工作、开除党籍等纪律处分。
    所有这些，对于我们以解放全人类、解放全体妇女为己任的共产党员来说，都是绝对不能容许的错误。我们党的中央关于保证执行婚姻法给全党的通知中说：“全体党员应一致拥护与遵守这一婚姻法，……保证予以正确执行。各级党委尤须采取适当办法，动员和组织党员向广大群众作宣传解释婚姻法的教育工作，使婚姻法成为群众中家喻户晓乐意执行的法律文件。而直接在人民政府婚姻登记机关和司法机关中工作的共产党员，以及在妇女团体和青年团体中工作的共产党员，更应在宣传和执行婚姻法工作中起积极的作用。”这里所规定的共产党员对于中华人民共和国婚姻法的正确态度，所有党的组织与党员，必须毫无例外地严格遵守，不得违犯。同一通知又说：“如果共产党员有干涉男女婚姻自由行为以及因干涉婚姻自由而造成被干涉者的伤害或死亡的行为，将不仅应负民事的和刑事的责任而受到国家的法律制裁，并且首先将受到党的纪律制裁。”各地党委必须根据这一规定向所有党员进行教育，让他们都能了解其意义。党的各级组织，对于已经发生非法干涉婚姻自由的行为的党员，必须依照这一规定予以制裁，决不应该有任何姑息与宽纵。
