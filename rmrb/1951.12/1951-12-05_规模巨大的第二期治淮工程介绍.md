The second phase of the Huai River harnessing project, aimed at fundamentally controlling the Huai River, has begun. The second phase is being carried out on the basis of the successful completion of the first phase. Its main content is: First, to greatly increase the construction of mountain valley reservoir projects and lake storage projects. In 1952, two large reservoirs will be completed, and the construction of three large reservoirs will begin, and two lake storage projects will be added in the middle reaches. The effective flood storage capacity of these projects is about 1.5 billion cubic meters, which, together with the flood storage capacity of the first phase, will play a greater role in preventing floods. Second, is the river channel improvement and inland river dredging project, including many tributaries from Fushan to Wuhe and the Huai River diversion project. After these projects are completed, areas in the Huai River basin that are more severely affected by rain and waterlogging and the backflow of the Huai River main stream will eliminate or reduce disasters. Third, large-scale irrigation projects will be started in northern Jiangsu to lay the foundation for drought prevention work. Therefore, the scale of this phase of the project is even larger than the first phase. In 1952, it is necessary to complete 400 million cubic meters of earthwork and many highly technical construction projects.

In Henan Province, the second-year project includes reservoir projects, river channel improvement projects, lake and depression storage projects, soil and water conservation in the upper reaches of various rivers, and ditch projects.

The Baisha Reservoir, which is under construction, is located in the upper reaches of the Ying River. It is planned to build an earth dam 46.5 meters high and 1,300 meters long, a 346-meter-long aqueduct, and a 100-meter-wide spillway. To complete this project, it is necessary to pile up 5.5 million cubic meters of earth and 270,000 cubic meters of stone. After the completion of this project, it can store 247 million cubic meters of water, so that when the maximum flood flow of the Ying River is 2,230 cubic meters per second, it can be controlled by the reservoir to 725 cubic meters per second; if it is 1,582 cubic meters per second in ordinary floods, it can be changed to 130 cubic meters per second; combined with river channel improvement, in 1952, the Ying River can basically eliminate floods, and lay the foundation for future farmland irrigation downstream. The aqueduct and spillway project of Baisha Reservoir has completed a part in 1951, and the entire project can be completed before the flood season in 1952. More than 100,000 migrant workers are working here day and night.

The Banqiao Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Sha River, a tributary of the Ru River, must build an earth dam 23.55 meters high and 1,700 meters long, a spillway 301 meters long and 80 meters wide, and an aqueduct 336 meters long. In the aqueduct project, it is also necessary to excavate a 70-meter-long tunnel. In 1951, the entire aqueduct project and part of the spillway project have been completed. After the completion of this reservoir, combined with the river channel improvement project of the Ru River, the floods of the Ru River can also be basically eliminated in 1952; however, after detailed drilling recently, it was found that the foundation of the earth dam has uneven silt layers in the part crossing the river channel, which is extremely unfavorable for dam construction. The cadres and the masses who built the reservoir have expressed their determination to overcome this difficulty.

The Boshan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Jintou River, another tributary of the Ru River, and the Nanwan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Shi River, will only carry out the excavation of water diversion tunnels and the construction of import and export projects in 1952. Many other reservoirs will be measured or drilled in 1952.

Another important project in Henan is the improvement project of the Hong, Ru, Ying, and Yellow Flood Area rivers. In order to dredge river channels and repair embankments, a total of 20 million cubic meters of earthwork is required, and 40 culvert gates should be built as necessary. After this improvement of the Hong, Ru, and Ying rivers, floods can be basically eliminated in 1952. In the Yellow Flood Area, seven rivers that are more severely affected will be selected for improvement first, so that major rains can reduce disasters and minor rains can avoid disasters.

Although the four depression storage projects of Laowangpo, Wusong Lake, Jiaoting Lake, and Tong Lake were completed in 1951, the inlet and outlet equipment, flood diversion channels, village enclosures, and internal drainage systems must be further repaired. According to the water inflow and outflow during the flood season, an improvement plan has been formulated and can be completed this winter.

Mobilizing the masses to promote soil and water conservation work is of great significance for reducing river sediment and prolonging the life of reservoirs. In 1952, it is planned to build 200 to 300 valley dams in the upper reaches of the Banqiao, Shimantan, and Ziluoshan reservoirs, and 150 to 200 valley dams in the upper reaches of the Boshan, Nanwan, and Longshan reservoirs.

The ditch project has proven effective in flood discharge and increased production based on the results of key experiments in 1951. In 1952, it was decided to mobilize the masses to carry out ditch projects in an area of 300 square kilometers in each of the Huaiyang, Shangqiu, and Chenliu special zones. Other special zones along the river will select areas and conduct key trials on their own.

In northern Anhui, the main tasks are to build reservoirs and lake storage projects, large-scale dredging of inland rivers, and some drainage and irrigation projects.

The Fozi Ridge Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Pi River is one of the important projects in the second phase of the Huai River harnessing project in northern Anhui. In the Huai River harnessing plan, it is also the largest reservoir. After the completion of this reservoir, it can store 500 million cubic meters of water, basically eliminating floods in the Pi River basin. After detailed investigation by the Huai River Harnessing Committee; more than ten experts have recently jointly studied the best dam site and dam type, and large-scale construction will begin soon. In order to transport the large amount of equipment required for the Fozi Ridge Reservoir, northern Anhui mobilized 180,000 migrant workers to rush to build a highway more than 60 kilometers long.

The two lake storage projects of Wabao and Shouxih Lake require dredging 5 million cubic meters of earthwork and building 5 million cubic meters of embankment earthwork in 1952, and building two gates. After the completion of this project, it can store 1 billion cubic meters of floodwater. It will be expanded and repaired again in 1953, and the flood storage capacity can be further increased. In addition, the Hongmeng depression storage project will also be built.

The midstream tributary improvement project mainly involves dredging eight rivers including the An River, Tang River, Kui River, West Fei River, and Zhao Wang River. A total of 37.21 million cubic meters of earth needs to be excavated. In conjunction with the dredging project, culvert gates such as Jiahe and Jiaogang Lake must be built to discharge internal water and prevent backflow.

The largest river channel improvement project is the management project of the Huai River main stream below Wuhe County. Because the Huai River flows through Hongze Lake, the influence of Hongze Lake's stagnation makes the water level of the Huai River main stream too high, which affects the discharge of floodwater from tributaries during flood periods, and sometimes backflow occurs. Because Hongze Lake is not controlled, it cannot fully play its flood storage role. In order to improve this section of the river, two larger projects must be built. The first is the diversion of internal and external water, that is, in the section from Wuhe to Fushan, the waterway for discharging rainwater in the inland area and the Huai River main stream are separated, so that the discharge of internal water is not affected by the Huai River main stream, so as to solve the serious waterlogging problem in the Suxian Special Zone. The second is to separate Hongze Lake and the Huai River, that is, to excavate a diversion river on the Huai River main stream below Xuyi, bypassing Hongze Lake, directly to Sanhe, and then through Gaoyou, Baoying and other lakes, into the Yangtze River; and between the Huai River and Hongze Lake, build gates for entering and leaving the lake to control it, so that the Huai River becomes an independent river channel, and Hongze Lake becomes a controlled reservoir. In 1952, the Xiacaowan Diversion River project, the Chonghe, Tonghe, and Yaohe dredging projects, and the Fengshan Qieling project will be completed first, with a total earthwork of approximately 30.73 million cubic meters. After the completion of this project, some tributaries of the Huai River above Shuanggou can flow directly into Hongze Lake and be separated from the Huai River, basically solving the problem of internal water discharge and backflow of the Huai River in the Suxian Special Zone.

In northern Jiangsu, irrigation projects are mainly carried out.

After being improved, Hongze Lake has become a large reservoir, and its water volume can be fully utilized to serve the people. The planning of the northern Jiangsu irrigation area is based on this ideal. After the completion of this project, 25 million acres of farmland in northern Jiangsu can be fully irrigated. The main part of this project is to excavate a general canal 170 kilometers long from Hongze Lake Gaoliangjian to the Yellow Sea, build a large gate in Gaoliangjian, and build a Yun Dong control gate where the canal passes through the canal, so that the maximum flow of the canal reaches 700 cubic meters per second. The total earthwork to be excavated is approximately 72.6 million cubic meters. In 1952, 45 million cubic meters of earth will be excavated first, and the construction of the Gaoliangjian gate and the Yun Dong control gate will begin. This project, which is of great significance in the Huai River harnessing project, will be completed in 1953.

Another project in the lower reaches of the Huai River is the improvement of the entry channel into the Yangtze River. In order to consolidate the canal embankment, the annual maintenance project will be carried out as usual. At the same time, the shallow and obstructed parts of the river channel will be dredged up and down the six gates, so that the discharge of the Huai River into the Yangtze River can be increased, which is of great benefit to the navigation of the canal.

The above is the main project for harnessing the Huai River in 1952. In addition, there are some projects organized with loans that are not included.

The second phase of the Huai River harnessing project has begun. Under the encouragement of Chairman Mao's great thought, under the specific leadership of party committees and people's governments at all levels, and with the experience gained in the first phase of the project, the task of the second phase of the Huai River harnessing project, although more arduous than the first phase, will surely be completed successfully.

    规模巨大的第二期治淮工程介绍
    中央人民政府水利部通讯组
    根治淮河的第二期工程，已经开工了。第二期工程是在第一期工程胜利完成的基础上进行的。它的主要内容是：第一、大量增修山谷水库工程和湖泊蓄洪工程。一九五二年要完成两个大型水库，开始兴修三个大型水库，并在中游增加两个湖泊蓄洪工程。这些工程的有效蓄洪量，约十五亿立方公尺，加上第一期工程的蓄洪量，对于防止洪水成灾，将发挥更大的作用。第二、是河道整理和内河疏浚工程，其中包括浮山至五河段许多支流和淮河分流的工程。这些工程完成以后，将使淮河流域受雨水内涝和淮河干流倒灌灾害比较严重的地区，消除或减免灾害。第三、在苏北开始兴修规模巨大的灌溉工程，为防旱工作建立基础。因此，这一期工程的规模，较第一期工程更为巨大。在一九五二年内，必需做好四亿立方公尺的土方工程，和许多技术性很高的建筑工程。
    在河南境内，第二年度的工程，包括水库工程、河道整理工程、湖泊洼地蓄洪工程的整理工程、各河上游的水土保持和沟洫工程。
    正在兴建着的白沙水库，在颍河上游。计划修筑一座高四十六点五公尺、长一千三百公尺的土坝，三百四十六公尺长的输水道，和一百公尺宽的溢洪道。为了完成这个工程，需要堆起五百五十万立方公尺土，二十七万立方公尺石头。这个工程完成以后，可以蓄水二亿四千七百万立方公尺，使颍河在最大洪水流量二千二百三十秒立方公尺时，经过水库的控制，变为七百二十五秒立方公尺；如在普通洪水一千五百八十二秒立方公尺时，则可变为一百三十秒立方公尺；再配合上河道的整理，在一九五二年，可使颍河基本上消除水灾，并为将来下游的农田灌溉建立基础。白沙水库的输水道和溢洪道工程，已在一九五一年完成一部，一九五二年汛期以前，可完成全部工程。现在有十余万民工，正在这里日以继夜地工作着。
    汝河支流沙河上游的板桥水库，必须修筑一座二十三点五五公尺高、一千七百公尺长的土坝，三百零一公尺长、八十公尺宽的溢洪道和三百三十六公尺长的输水道。在输水道工程中，还要开凿七十公尺长的隧洞。一九五一年已完成全部输水道工程和部分溢洪道工程。这个水库修成以后，配合汝河的河道整理工程，同样可在一九五二年，基本上消除汝河的水灾；但最近经过详细钻探，发现该土坝的基础，在横过河道部分，有厚薄不匀的淤泥层，这对于筑坝是极为不利的。修筑水库的干部和群众，已表示决心克服这一困难。
    汝河另一条支流浸头河上游的薄山水库，和浉河上游的南湾水库，一九五二年只进行开凿输水隧洞和修筑进出口的工程。其余的许多水库，将在一九五二年进行测量或钻探。
    河南的另一项重要工程，是整理洪、汝、颍及黄泛区各河道工程。为了疏浚河道和培修堤防，共需做二千万立方公尺的土工，并择要修建涵闸四十座。洪、汝、颍三个河道，经过这次整理，一九五二年可以基本上消除水灾。黄泛区先选择为害比较严重的七条河道，加以整理，也可做到大雨减灾，小雨免灾。
    老王坡、吴宋湖、蛟停湖、潼湖四处洼地蓄洪工程，虽然已于一九五一年完工，但进出水口设备，引洪道，村庄围堤，内部排水系统等，都必须进一步整修。已根据汛期进出水情况，拟具改善计划，今冬即可整理完竣。
    发动群众，推行水土保持工作，对于减少河水的泥沙，延长水库的寿命，都有很大作用。一九五二年拟在板桥、石漫滩和紫罗山水库上游，各做谷坊二百到三百座，在薄山、南湾、龙山等水库上游，各做谷坊一百五十座到二百座。
    沟洫工程，经一九五一年重点试验结果，在排洪、增产方面，都有成效。一九五二年内，决定在淮阳、商邱、陈留三专区，发动群众各做三百平方公里面积的沟洫工程。沿河其他专区，则自行选择地区，重点试办。
    在皖北境内，主要是兴修水库和湖泊蓄洪工程，大规模疏浚内河和一部分排水灌溉工程。
    渒河上游的佛子岭水库，是皖北第二期治淮的重要工程之一。在治淮计划中，它也是最大的一个水库。这个水库筑成后，可以蓄水五亿立方公尺，基本上消除渒河流域的水灾。这一工程经过治淮委员会详细查勘；最近又有十多位专家，共同研究了最好的坝址和坝型，不久即可大规模动工。为运输佛子岭水库所需的大量器材，皖北动员了十八万民工，赶修了六十多公里长的公路。
    瓦埠、寿西两湖蓄洪工程，一九五二年须疏浚土方五百万立方公尺，筑堤土方五百万立方公尺，建闸两座。这个工程完成后可蓄洪十亿立方公尺。一九五三年将再扩修，蓄洪量尚可增加。另外，还要兴修洪濛洼地蓄洪工程。
    中游整理支流工程，主要是疏浚安河、唐河、奎河、西淝河、赵王河等八条河流。共须开挖三千七百二十一万立方公尺土。配合疏浚工程，并须修建架河、焦岗湖等涵闸，以宣泄内水，防止倒灌。
    最大的河道整理工程，是五河县以下淮河干流的治理工程。因为淮河流经洪泽湖内，受洪泽湖停潴的影响，使淮河干流水位过高，在洪水时期，影响支流洪水的排泄，有时并发生倒灌现象。洪泽湖因为没有控制，也不能充分发挥蓄洪的作用。为了整理这一段河流，要兴修两个较大的工程。第一是内外水分流，就是在五河到浮山段，使内地排泄雨水的水道，和淮河干流分开，使内水的排泄，不受淮河干流的影响，以解决宿县专区严重的内涝问题。第二是把洪泽湖和淮河分开，就是在盱眙以下的淮河干流上，开挖一条引河，撇开洪泽湖，直通三河，再经高邮、宝应等湖，流入长江；并在淮河和洪泽湖间，修筑入湖和出湖的闸坝，加以节制，使淮河成为独立的河道，使洪泽湖成为有控制的水库。一九五二年先完成下草湾引河工程，漴河、潼河、窑河等疏浚工程，和峰山切岭工程，共计土工约三千零七十三万立方公尺。这个工程完成以后，可使双沟以上淮河的一些支流，直接流入洪泽湖，和淮河分开，基本解决了宿县专区内水宣泄和淮河倒灌的问题。
    在苏北境内，主要是进行灌溉工程。
    洪泽湖经过整理，成为一大水库，完全可以充分利用它的水量，来为人民服务。苏北大灌溉区的规划，就是根据这个理想制定的。这个工程全部完成后，可使苏北两千五百万亩农田，得到充分的灌溉。这项工程的主要部分，是从洪泽湖高良涧到黄海，开挖一条全长一百七十公里的总干渠，并在高良涧地方，修建一座大闸，在渠道穿过运河的地方修筑运东节制闸，使渠道最大的流量，达到七百秒立方公尺。总计需挖掘的土方约七千二百六十万立方公尺，一九五二年先开挖四千五百万立方公尺土，并开始兴修高良涧的大闸，和运东节制闸。这个在治淮中极有意义的工程，将在一九五三年全部完成。
    淮河下游的另一项工程，是整理入江航道。为巩固运河堤防，按照习惯，将进行一年一度的岁修工程。同时，并在六闸上下，疏浚河道的浅阻部分，这样可以使淮河入江的泄量增加，对于运河的航运，也有极大的好处。
    以上是一九五二年度治理淮河的主要工程。另外还有一些贷款举办的工程，尚未包括在内。
    第二期治淮工程已经开始了。在毛主席伟大思想的鼓舞之下，在各级党委和人民政府的具体领导之下，加上第一期工程中创造的经验，第二期治淮的任务，虽然比第一期更为艰巨，也必定会胜利完成的。
