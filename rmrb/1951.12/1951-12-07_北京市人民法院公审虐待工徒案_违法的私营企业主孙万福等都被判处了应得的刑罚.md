    Beijing People's Court Publicly Tries Cases of Abuse of Apprentices
    Illegal Private Business Owners Sun Wanfu and Others Sentenced Accordingly
    On the afternoon of December 3rd, the Beijing People's Court simultaneously held a public trial for fourteen cases of oppression and abuse of apprentices. Over 400 people attended as observers, including trade union workers and representatives of both labor and management from relevant industries. Representatives from the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce also attended as jurors.

    Among the fourteen cases, the following three cases of consistent apprentice abuse were the most serious:

    (1) Sun Wanfu and Sun Wanlu, brothers, jointly funded and opened Sun Ji Iron Shop and Shuangli Iron Shop. Before the liberation of Beijing, they frequently beat apprentices. After liberation, they did not change at all, and continued to rely on the feudal power of the shopkeeper to assault apprentices (sometimes with wooden sticks) 23 times. They also arbitrarily dismissed apprentices and obstructed them from joining the trade union. Both defendants were sentenced to five years imprisonment.

    (2) Ye Mingquan, manager of Ye Ji Horseshoe Shop, frequently beat and abused apprentices after liberation. He not only punched and kicked them, but also used a hooked knife to cut them. When apprentices were sick, he refused to provide medical treatment and even complained that they couldn’t hammer or fan the fire when ill. Ye Mingquan was sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment.

    (3) Zhao Lixiang and Zhao Lichang, brothers, opened Xie Qing He Restaurant and consistently deducted wages and extended working hours. Apprentices worked up to twenty hours a day. When apprentices dozed off due to sleep deprivation and extreme fatigue, they were often brutally beaten by the Zhao brothers. Apprentice Liu Erzhu's eyes were burned by Zhao Lixiang with hot fire tongs. Zhao Lixiang was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment; Zhao Lichang was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment. The court also ordered Zhao Lichang to return the deducted wages to the apprentices.

    Some lawless private business owners not only physically punished apprentices but also did not make an effort to teach them skills, and also adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the trade union; they attempted to maintain the old feudal system of oppression. For example, Zhang Xinsheng, manager of Xin Ji Shoe Shop, hired fifteen-year-old Liu Chungeng as an apprentice but did not teach Liu any skills, instead ordering Liu to hold children and cook all day. One day, a customer came to the shop and needed a pencil. Zhang Xinsheng ordered Liu to find one, but Liu could not find it. Zhang picked up a hammer and beat Liu, saying, "I will follow the old rules of the shop. If I call for a pencil three times and it doesn't come, I will beat you!" Because Zhang Xinsheng felt that Liu Chungeng was not taking good care of the children, he slapped Liu with a shoe sole and even said, "The trade union tells you not to watch the children, so you don't watch them? I am hitting the trade union!" Based on the crimes committed by Zhang Xinsheng, the Municipal People's Court sentenced him to three years and six months imprisonment.

    Restricting apprentices from participating in political activities and obstructing them from participating in after-work studies is also illegal. Zhao Jinchang of Xinzeng Iron Factory was sentenced to one year imprisonment for beating apprentice Wang Yuze, who had asked him for leave to attend an after-school exam.

    The illegal private business owners in the other cases were also convicted. The representatives who attended the hearing enthusiastically supported the judgment of the People's Court. (Si Zhi)

    北京市人民法院公审虐待工徒案
    违法的私营企业主孙万福等都被判处了应得的刑罚
    北京市人民法院十二月三日下午对十四件压迫、虐待工徒案同时举行公开审判。参加旁听的有工会工作者及有关行业的劳资双方代表共四百多人。市劳动局、工商局、市总工会、市工商业联合会都派有代表参加陪审。
    这十四案中以一贯虐待工徒的下面三案为最严重：
    （一）孙万福、孙万禄兄弟二人，共同出资开设孙记铁铺及双立铁铺，北京解放前就经常殴打工徒，解放后一点也没有改，仍然依仗封建的掌柜权势先后毒打工徒（有时用木棍）二十三人次；并擅自解雇工徒，阻挠工徒加入工会。两被告各被判处徒刑五年。
    （二）叶记马掌铺经理叶明全，在解放后经常殴打、虐待工徒，不但拳打脚踢，而且还用勾刀砍。工徒病了他不给医治，还嫌有病打不了锤、扇不了火。叶明全被判徒刑四年六个月。
    （三）赵立祥、赵立昌兄弟二人，开设协庆和饭馆，一向克扣工资，延长劳动时间。工徒每日工作时间达二十小时。工徒因睡眠不足过度疲乏而打盹时，就常遭赵姓兄弟毒打。工徒刘二柱曾被赵立祥用火筷烫伤了眼睛。赵立祥被判处徒刑三年六个月；赵立昌被判处徒刑二年六个月。法院并判令赵立昌退还克扣工徒的工资。
    部分不法私营企业主不但体罚工徒，同时还不尽心教授技术，对工会也采取对立态度；他们企图维持旧的封建压迫制度。例如：信记鞋铺经理张信生雇了十五岁的刘春耕做学徒，并不教刘学习技术，整日令刘抱孩子、做饭。有一天，店里来了顾主，需用铅笔，张信生令刘去找没有找着，张拿起鎯头就打刘，还说：“我要按柜上老规矩办，如叫三声铅笔不来，我就打你！”张信生因为嫌刘春耕照顾小孩不好，用鞋底打了刘之后竟说：“工会叫你不看孩子你就不看吗？我打的就是工会！”市人民法院根据张信生所犯的罪行，判了他三年六个月徒刑。
    限制工徒参加政治活动、阻挠工徒参加业余学习的行为也是违法的。新增铁工厂的赵金昌因为殴打向他请假参加业余学校考试的工徒王玉泽，被判徒刑一年。
    其他各案的违法私营企业主也都被判了罪。参加旁听的代表们都热烈拥护人民法院的判决。（思之）
