    Henan Postal District Exceeds Annual Newspaper Distribution Plan Ahead of Schedule

    The People's Daily's distribution plan in the Henan Postal District for 1951 was 12,000 copies; the Henan Daily's distribution plan in the region was 60,000 copies. As of November 25th, the People's Daily had reached 19,393 copies. As of November 12th, the Henan Daily had reached 70,500 copies.

    Why was the Henan Postal District able to exceed its annual distribution target ahead of schedule?

    The Henan Postal and Telecommunications Administration's report to the Central-South Postal and Telecommunications Administration cited the following reasons:

    (1) First and foremost, the unfolding of the three major movements – Resist America, Aid Korea, Land Reform, and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries – has universally raised the political awareness of the masses, leading to widespread current affairs learning. In particular, the vast numbers of liberated peasants have a more urgent need for cultural nourishment. The rapid recovery and development of the industrial and agricultural economy, and the universal increase in the purchasing power of the masses, have created favorable conditions for carrying out newspaper and magazine distribution work.

    (2) The local Party committee's emphasis on distribution work. Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, a provincial distribution work committee was established in July, which played a significant role in promoting newspaper and magazine distribution work. Before the establishment of the distribution work committee, the People's Daily had only been distributed to 15,009 copies, and the Henan Daily to 56,914 copies. After the establishment of the distribution work committee, the Provincial Party Committee first called on Party committees at all levels to attach importance to distribution work and issued instructions to "strengthen newspaper and magazine distribution work." As a result, the People's Daily increased by more than 4,000 copies from July to November; the Henan Daily increased by more than 13,000 copies from July to November. The circulation figures of other newspapers and magazines have also been rising steadily.

    (3) The efforts of all postal workers. The trade union closely cooperated with the administration and, in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, launched a patriotic distribution competition throughout the province, greatly enhancing the political understanding of postal workers. During the competition, fighting slogans such as "Distributing one more newspaper or magazine is equivalent to eliminating one more enemy" and "Distributing one more newspaper or magazine increases the strength to resist America and aid Korea" were put forward, and challenges and responses were enthusiastically launched between bureaus, groups, lines, and individuals, ensuring the over-fulfillment of the distribution plans for each quarter of this year.

    In addition, cultural stations have been widely established in many counties throughout the province, which not only improved delivery speed but also expanded the delivery range. At the same time, the widespread organization of reading groups has further enhanced the propaganda role of newspapers and solved the economic difficulties of individual subscriptions.

### 河南邮区提前超额完成了报纸发行的全年计划

    河南邮区提前超额完成了报纸发行的全年计划
    人民日报一九五一年在河南邮区的发行计划是一万二千份；河南日报在该区的发行计划是六万份。截至十一月二十五日止，人民日报已发展到一万九千三百九十三份。截至十一月十二日止，河南日报已发展到七万零五百份。
    为什么河南邮区能够提前超额完成全年的发行任务呢？
    河南邮电管理局给中南邮电管理局的报告中，举出了以下几点原因：
    （一）首先是抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的开展，群众政治觉悟普遍提高，广泛地展开了时事学习；尤其是广大的翻身农民更迫切地要求文化食粮。工业农业经济的迅速恢复和发展，群众购买力的普遍提高，这些都为开展报刊发行工作创造了有利的条件。
    （二）当地党委对发行工作的重视。在省委领导下于七月份成立了省的发行工作委员会，对开展报刊发行工作起了很大的作用。在发行工作委员会没有成立以前，人民日报才发行到一万五千零九份，河南日报发行到五万六千九百十四份。发行工作委员会成立之后，省委首先号召各级党委重视发行工作，并颁布了“加强报刊发行工作”的指示。所以人民日报自七月至十一月，四个月中便增加了四千多份；河南日报自七月至十一月，四个月中便增加了一万三千多份。其它各种报刊的发行数字也随之不断上升。
    （三）邮局全体员工的努力。工会与行政密切配合，并结合抗美援朝运动，在全省普遍展开了爱国主义的发行竞赛运动，大大地提高了邮政员工的政治认识。在竞赛中，提出“多发展一份报刊，等于多消灭一个敌人”，“多发展一份报刊，就增加一份抗美援朝力量”等战斗口号，并在局与局、组与组、线与线、个人与个人之间热烈地展开了挑战应战，保证了本年各季发行计划的超额完成。
    此外，如在全省很多县份之内，普遍建立了文化站，不仅提高了投递速度，而且还扩大了投递面。同时，广泛地组织读报组，更能发挥报纸宣传作用和解决个人订报的经济困难。    金尼
