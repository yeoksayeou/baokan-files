    A Certain Training Regiment of the Logistics Department of the Political Department of the Central South Military Region
    Should Not Violate Regulations by Selling Supply Grain
    To the Editor: A certain training regiment of the Logistics Department of the Political Department of the Central South Military Region does not comply with disbursement regulations and arbitrarily sells supply grain, causing losses to state property. This training regiment has always drawn its supply grain from the Hengshan County Grain Bureau. In the first half of this year, it twice sold a total of 55,000 jin of supply grain to the Hengshan Trading Branch Company; sometimes it also sold to private merchants, using the allocation slips issued by the Grain Bureau as currency for transactions in the market.
    After the implementation of the unified accounting system in July, the Grain Bureau raised an objection to the comrade in charge of supply for the training regiment: "It is imperative to collect the grain within the time limit. Any uneaten supply grain must be turned over." However, they refused to turn it over. On October 17, they again sold 33,500 jin of supply grain, and wrote a letter of introduction in the name of the organization to Comrade Wang Jianzhang to take to the Hengshan Trading Branch Company. The Hengshan Trading Branch Company refused to accept it, so they went to the Hengshan Chengguan Town Grain Exchange to sell it, earning a total of 23,885,500 yuan in Renminbi. They also sold a temporary storage certificate from the Grain Bureau's processing plant, limited to September 25, for 4,000 jin of supply rice to the Hengshan Trading Branch Company. On October 28, Huang Kuangzhao, the business section chief of the Hengshan Grain Branch Company, said to the accounting section of the Grain Bureau: "The training regiment has about 300,000 jin of supply grain to sell again, and we can only buy about 100,000 jin for the time being." The Grain Bureau immediately pointed out to him that he could not buy it casually.
    The repeated violations of the disbursement regulations by the training regiment, arbitrarily selling the grain obtained with the people's blood and sweat, is an illegal act, and the local people's government should investigate and deal with it.    Zhao Menglin

    中南军区政治部后勤处某教导团
    不应该违反制度变卖供给粮
    编辑同志：中南军区政治部后勤处某教导团不遵守支拨制度，随意变卖供给粮食，使国家财产受到损失。该教导团一向是在衡山县粮食局拨取供给粮，今年上半年曾两次把供给粮卖给衡山贸易支公司计五万五千斤；有时还卖给私商，把粮食局开出的拨条当做货币在市场上做交易。
    今年七月实行统一会计制度以后，粮食局曾向该教导团管供给的同志提出过意见：“务必在限期内取粮。吃不完的供给粮，必须上缴。”但他们却拒不上缴。至十月十七日又变卖供给粮三万三千五百斤，并以机关名义写介绍信交给王建章同志带至衡山贸易支公司。衡山贸易支公司未予接受，于是他们又到衡山城关镇粮食交易所出卖，共计卖得人民币二千三百八十八万五千五百元。又把粮食局加工厂限至九月二十五日的暂存证，计供给米四千斤卖给衡山贸易支公司。十月二十八日衡山粮食支公司业务股长黄匡兆同志到粮食局对会计股说：“教导团有三十来万斤供给粮又要出卖，我们暂时只能买十多万斤。”粮食局当即向他指出不能随便接买。
    某教导团历次违反支拨制度，把人民血汗换来的粮食，随意出卖，这是违法的行为，当地人民政府应调查处理。    赵梦麟
