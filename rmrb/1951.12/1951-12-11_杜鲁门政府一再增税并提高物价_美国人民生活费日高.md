    Truman Government Repeatedly Raises Taxes and Increases Prices
    American People's Cost of Living Rises Daily

    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch] The inflation and tax increases promoted by the American government's military expansion and war preparations have caused the American people's cost of living to continuously rise, even bourgeois newspapers admit that "the people have no means of livelihood." According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency: the United Electrical Workers Union of America recently released a research report, which pointed out that since January 1950, the cost of living in the United States has increased by more than 20%. January 1950 was the base period for wage standards selected by the Truman government, and the government's wage freeze policy stipulated that increases in workers' wages should not exceed 10% of this period.

    Starting from November 1st this year, the US government increased the tax rate on salary and wage income by about 12%. As a result of this increase, even without calculating the increase in other living expenses from October to November, according to the United Electrical Workers Union's index, the cost of living in November will rise from 276.1 in October (using the 1939 index as 100) to 278.4, which is 20.3% higher than in January 1950, and 5% higher than in January 1951, before the wage freeze. The United Electrical Workers Union's report specifically pointed out that the food price index in October 1951 was 313. In other words, food prices are now three times more expensive than before World War II. Food expenses account for about 40% of the total expenditure of ordinary workers' families, and is the largest item in the living expenses of the working people.

    Although the lives of the working people have been greatly deteriorated due to increased taxes and rising prices, the American government, which serves the interests of big capitalists, continues to greedily try to lower their living standards. On the 5th of this month, the so-called "Price Stabilization Agency" ordered to increase the prices of many necessities, including meat, milk, butter, and other foods, clothing, tobacco, coal, gasoline, beer, and medicines, etc. This agency, which is named "stabilizing" prices but actually helps capitalists "legally" raise commodity prices, has ordered price increases for tens of thousands of items more than once since it "froze" prices in January of this year.

    The New York "Daily Mirror" recently acknowledged the plight of the American people under the heavy burden of war in an editorial titled "Poverty Deliberately Created," stating it was "heavy taxes, the people have no means of livelihood." The "Daily Mirror" said: "Everything, including taxes, is soaring, even beef broth is expensive." The report also stated: "It is difficult to estimate how much the government takes from every dollar we earn. There are income taxes and payroll taxes, state taxes, cigarette taxes, gasoline taxes, consumer taxes, and various hidden taxes. Even the bread we eat is subject to many kinds of taxes. If an accountant accurately calculates in detail, it seems that about half of the money we earn is used to pay taxes. Our living standards are declining every year." Eaton, the New York correspondent for the London "Daily Mail," left New York City for two months. After returning, he wrote: "When I returned here, everything here—prices, taxes, rent, transportation fares, blood pressure—had risen."

### 杜鲁门政府一再增税并提高物价  美国人民生活费日高

    杜鲁门政府一再增税并提高物价
    美国人民生活费日高
    【新华社八日讯】美国政府扩军备战所促进的通货膨胀和增税使美国人民生活费用不断上升，连资产阶级的报纸也承认“民不聊生”。据电通社消息：美国联合电气工人工会最近公布了一份研究报告，其中指出，自从一九五○年一月以来，美国的生活费用已经增加了百分之二十以上。一九五○年一月是杜鲁门政府选定的工资标准的基期，政府的冻结工资政策曾规定工人工资的增加不得超过这个时期的百分之十。
    今年十一月一日起，美国政府对薪金和工资收入又增加税额约百分之十二。由于这一增加的结果，即使不计算从十月到十一月中间其他生活费用的增加，按照联合电气工人工会的指数，十一月份生活费也将从十月份的二百七十六点一（以一九三九年的指数作一百计算）上升到二百七十八点四，即比一九五○年一月高百分之二十点三，比一九五一年一月、工资冻结前高百分之五。联合电气工人工会这份报告特别指出食物价格指数在一九五一年十月是三百十三。换言之，现在的食物价格比第二次世界大战前贵三倍。食物的费用约占普通工人家庭总支出的百分之四十，是劳动人民开支的最大项目。
    虽然劳动人民的生活已因捐税增加和物价腾升而大为恶化，为大资本家利益服务的美国政府却贪婪无度地继续设法压低他们的生活水平。本月五日，所谓“物价稳定局”又下令增加许多生活必需品的价格，其中包括肉类、牛奶、牛油以及其他食物、衣服、烟草、煤、汽油、啤酒和药品等等。这个名为“稳定”物价而实际上是帮助资本家“合法地”提高商品价格的机构自今年一月“冻结”物价以来，已不只一次地下令提高成万种物品的价格。
    纽约“每日镜报”最近在一篇题为“故意制造的贫穷”的社论中承认美国人民在战争重担下的困苦情形是“赋税重重、民不聊生”。“每日镜报”说：“一切东西，包括赋税在内，都高涨不已，甚至连牛肉汤都贵了。”该报又说：“政府究竟从我们挣来的一块钱中拿去多少，很难估计。有所得税和薪资税、州税、香烟税、汽油税、消费税和各种暗中征收的税。甚至我们吃的面包也要纳许多种税。如果一个会计精确地详细地计算一下，我们所挣的钱似乎约有一半要用来付税。我们的生活水准每年都在下降”。伦敦“每日邮报”驻纽约记者伊顿离开纽约市两个月。在他回去之后他写道：“当我回到这里时，这里的一切东西——物价、赋税、房租、车费、血压——都上涨了。”
