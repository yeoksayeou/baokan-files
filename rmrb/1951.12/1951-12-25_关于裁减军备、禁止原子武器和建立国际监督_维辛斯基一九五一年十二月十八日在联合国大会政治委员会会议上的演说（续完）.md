The US-UK-France Amendment, like the Original Proposal, Does Not Affirmatively State the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons

The nature of the "Three Powers" amendment proposal is also such, as we have demonstrated in discussing some of its fundamental points, that this proposal cannot solve any problem related to the limitation and reduction of armed forces and armaments, let alone the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international supervision. However, on this issue, one must be very clear. It is precisely from this consideration that the Soviet delegation proposed to include the following section in the "Three Powers" proposal as the first section of the proposal's text. This section suggests that the United Nations General Assembly declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establish strict international supervision to ensure compliance with this prohibition. Regarding this point, the Soviet delegation suggested that the General Assembly instruct the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission to draft a convention for submission to the Security Council for consideration. This draft convention should stipulate measures to ensure the implementation of the General Assembly's resolution on the prohibition of atomic weapons, the cessation of the production of atomic weapons, the complete use of atomic bombs already manufactured for civilian purposes, and the establishment of strict international supervision to ensure the implementation of the aforementioned convention.

Can these unambiguous, clear, firm, and definitive suggestions from the Soviet Union be compared with the vague and uncertain suggestions contained in Section 3 of the "Three Powers" proposal, which are attached with various reservations and conditions? Now is the time to clearly recognize the fundamental differences in principle between these two proposals. On the one hand, the Soviet Union has put forward suggestions advocating the declaration of the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, the establishment of strict international supervision, and the drafting of a convention in the shortest possible time to stipulate measures to ensure the implementation of this prohibition. This is the situation on our side, the Soviet side.

On the other hand, the United States, Britain, and France have neither a statement on the prohibition of atomic weapons nor a decision on the establishment of international supervision. At the same time, they said a lot of ambiguous words, saying that they ordered the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission to draft recommendations to be included in the treaty on the reduction of all armed forces and the establishment of effective supervision to ensure the implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons.

However, where is the prohibition that should be supervised? You say: It is self-evident. Then please allow us to ask you to clearly and accurately say: Prohibition of atomic weapons.

However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France dare not use clear and precise language to affirm the prohibition of atomic weapons. They evade this issue. They only say that they order the committee to draft certain recommendations—and these recommendations are not about the prohibition of atomic weapons, but only about the establishment of supervision for the purpose of prohibiting atomic weapons.

If one considers the genuine desire to solve the problem contained in the particularly important sentence "Prohibit atomic weapons, establish supervision to ensure the implementation of the prohibition," one will feel that someone is joking here, taking a completely unserious attitude. Although these two sentences are very short, they are particularly important. Hundreds of millions of people are fighting for these two sentences, and despite encountering various conspiracies, tricks, and resistance along the way, they will surely win this struggle. They must overcome and undoubtedly will be able to overcome these conspiracies, tricks, and resistance.

The US, UK, and France Must Issue a Direct Statement on Establishing an International Control Organization, and Cannot Be Vague and Only Allude to It

The Soviet delegation also suggested adding a new suggestion proposed by the Soviet delegation regarding the establishment of an international control organization within the framework of the Security Council in the "Three Powers" proposal. We have said that every sincere plan advocating a substantial reduction in all armed forces and armaments must stipulate the establishment of such an organization. The new third item put forward by the Soviet delegation in the middle of Section 5 of the original text of the Soviet delegation's amendment points out that the task of this organization should be "to supervise the reduction of all types of armaments and armed forces, and to supervise the implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons, with a view to the accurate and faithful implementation of this prohibition, and this international organization must publish information on all armed forces (including paramilitary forces, public security forces, and police forces) and all armaments (including atomic weapons)." This point also stipulates that, according to the decisions of the aforementioned international control organization, effective international investigations should be carried out, and this supervision should include the review of the information submitted.

Could anything be clearer than our amendment regarding the true purpose, tasks, and functions of this control organization (stipulating the rights and obligations of this control organization)?

In order to avoid any misunderstanding about the establishment of the international control organization, the Soviet delegation suggested that the future convention should stipulate that the international control organization be responsible for supervising the implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons. It should also stipulate the composition, rights, and obligations of the control organization, and order this organization to immediately begin investigating (that is, inspecting) all facilities for the production and storage of atomic weapons after the conclusion of the aforementioned convention, in order to determine whether the convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons has been implemented.

Our suggestion advocates that after the conclusion of this convention, regardless of whether the international control organization has begun to work, an investigation should be carried out immediately to inspect the production and storage of atomic weapons. The people who put forward the "Three Powers" proposal did not say a word about our suggestion. They preferred to avoid this issue. However, this suggestion is very important. This suggestion proves that the Soviet Union does not advocate or intend to delay the prohibition of atomic weapons to a later stage or the final stage—as the Baruch Plan stipulated, and as the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France advocated.

I must talk about another situation. Chairman Naev's memorandum of the Sub-Committee says (see page 9 of the Russian text) that the three powers believe that their proposal already implicitly implies the establishment of a control organization.

But why only implicitly imply this meaning? Why do the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, on the one hand, passionately say that the real key to solving the entire problem of the prohibition of atomic weapons is precisely this kind of organization, and on the other hand, only implicitly imply the establishment of this kind of organization? Does the memorandum of the chairman of the Sub-Committee not also say that only the Soviet amendment directly mentions the need to establish an international control organization?

But—I mention in passing—in the Sub-Committee, one of the three powers stubbornly opposed adding this half-sentence to Mr. Naev's memorandum. We spent a lot of effort to prove that truth is truth, and the memorandum should reflect the real situation. So I asked them to point out the point in the "Three Powers" proposal that talked about the establishment of an international control organization. But it could not be pointed out, because it does not exist.

Isn't this a typical situation?

The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France are willing to imply many things. They imply the establishment of an international control organization, they imply the prohibition of atomic weapons—they are very willing to imply—they have done enough in this regard. But what is necessary is not implication, but the issuance of a direct statement, which is what they are trying to avoid.

They say that we cannot guarantee ourselves; they say that if the General Assembly passes a decision prohibiting atomic weapons without exercising supervision over us, such as international supervision, then we cannot guarantee ourselves.

But we are able to guarantee ourselves, and we will implement this decision even without supervision. Please accept this decision!

The Conclusion of the US, UK, and France Proposal is Self-Evident: The Three Powers Refuse to Unconditionally Prohibit Atomic Weapons

Mr. Jessup said that Section 4 is newly added. Its meaning is the same as Section 5 of the Soviet amendment; like Section 3, Item B, as they amended it, it clearly stipulates that the original three-power proposal had already clearly expressed the meaning that an international control organization must be established to ensure the implementation of the disarmament plan.

But let's take a look at the amended Section 3, Item B, which does not mention the establishment of a control organization, but only indirectly mentions it in the sentence about investigation. According to this item, this investigation should be conducted according to the decisions of the international control organization that is being established.

But I can say that you are playing with words. The international control organization that is being established is mentioned here and there. In this way, you can say that everything that can be established is being established. Saying that the investigation will be conducted according to the decisions of the control organization that is being established—this is absolutely not equivalent to deciding to establish such an organization. If it really means this, then why not state it clearly, why not eliminate ambiguity and equivocation? In this case, why not clearly state that the control organization is being established? But neither in the third section I mentioned here, nor anywhere else, nor in this new fourth section of the amended proposal, can you find a proposal to establish such an organization. This truly new fourth section advocates ordering the committee to draft plans to establish an international control organization within the framework of the Security Council. That's how it's said: draft plans to establish an international control organization within the framework of the Security Council. But it must be noted that this also does not mention the establishment of the international control organization itself. Therefore, we have not heard a clear and affirmative statement on this issue here. They are still avoiding the issue.

Based on what has been said above, the conclusion can be self-evident: The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have rejected the suggestion to unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons, or to be more precise, rejected the suggestion that the General Assembly should declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. They avoid directly undertaking the obligation to establish an international control organization, so they use some complex and ambiguous words to cover up their true intentions on this issue. There are great differences in substance between the newly proposed third item of the Soviet delegation and Section 3, Item B of the "Three Powers" amended proposal, not only in wording and presentation. This difference determines the divergence between us.

If the drafters of the "Three Powers" proposal truly hoped that the convention would mention the establishment of an international control organization, then nothing could prevent them from doing so. The establishment of an international control organization must be mentioned in the convention. But they do not do so. It is we, the Soviet delegation, who do this. Here is where the superiority of our suggestion lies.

The Reason Why the American Baruch Plan Could Not Be Accepted is That it Threatened the Sovereignty of Nations and States

On December 15, Mr. Jessup seemed to have spoken three times. In his third speech on December 15, Mr. Jessup showed that he was very good at making jokes. He spent a lot of effort to make the First Committee laugh. He talked about a golden car, pulled by sixty white pigeons, as well as magic wands and beautiful women. Mr. Jessup has obviously confused things. Perhaps he feels that he is not in the Political Committee, but among the children dancing around the Christmas tree. (Laughter) Christmas is really coming soon. However, this is not so dangerous for the First Committee. However, after Mr. Jessup made some jokes, that is, when he came to analyze the serious issues discussed by the First Committee again, he still did not change to a serious tone.

Frankly speaking, can we seriously treat Mr. Jessup's words? He said: The Soviet delegation has two paragraphs in the amendment on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the preparation of a convention stipulating various measures to ensure the implementation of this convention: The first paragraph talks about the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of supervision, and the second paragraph talks about ordering the committee to draft the relevant convention. According to him, this means that there is only a little relationship between the two issues, so the secret purpose is to avoid establishing international supervision after announcing the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Mr. Jessup blames the Soviet Union for opposing the Baruch Plan for five years and not showing any room for change. But the United States has insisted on this plan for five years—what room for change has it shown? They said this is the best plan, saying there is no better plan—although they also made such reservations: "If there is a better plan, we are willing to think about it." But they knew in advance that there would be no better plan, because they believed that this was the best plan of all possible plans. They insist on this Baruch Plan. They continue to stubbornly insist on this plan, although this plan has been fully and seriously criticized from all sides for various reasons. I cite facts. Even a newspaper like the British "Times" said that the Baruch Plan is a utopian plan. Therefore, unless one has the purpose of not wanting a plan at all, it is meaningless to defend this plan.

The arguments of the United States, Britain, and France are like this. They say: "But you yourselves insist on following your method—not the Baruch Plan and accept the Soviet plan." Then, let us study the reasons why we do not want your plan. Because this plan makes the so-called international control organization an American super-trust, subjecting the entire economy of a country to it, and transferring it to it. The entire fate of this country will therefore be arbitrarily dominated by the decisions of this international control organization. This international control organization, even in the words of the supporters of this plan, can only be said to be an organization that implements the policies of the United States of America. This plan threatens the sovereignty of nations and states. Therefore, people who respect the sovereignty of their own country and their own people cannot agree to this plan. The reason why the Baruch Plan cannot be accepted is precisely because it threatens the sovereignty of nations and states. It is also unacceptable because it is fruitless, delaying the most important things to the last few stages, and it also depends on several conditions, and these conditions depend entirely on whether you are happy.

If we mention the stage-by-stage approach, mention the control organization's ownership of all atomic materials and all atomic enterprises, and even enterprises related to the atomic industry according to the Baruch Plan, then it can be clearly seen that this plan certainly cannot be accepted by countries that do not want to commit suicide.

The Soviet Union Supports Egypt's Opinion, but the Soviet Union Believes That the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons Should Not Wait Until the Process of Establishing an International Control Organization is Completed

Mr. Jessup, as before, said that the Soviet Union only suggests the prohibition of atomic weapons on paper. But we have already pointed out that this objection is false and unfounded. The Egyptian representative also pointed this out in his speech on December 15. I think it is not superfluous to repeat his words today in front of the representatives of the member states of the committee.

The Egyptian representative said: "It is almost impossible to establish an organization to supervise the production of atomic weapons and use all atomic energy for civilian purposes (which is also supervision) in a short time." The Egyptian representative asked:

"What work should we do during this period? We cannot separate the production of atomic weapons, the control of these weapons and atomic energy, from the actual use of these weapons." He said: "We have many conventions, such as the Red Cross Convention, the convention prohibiting the use of poison gas, and many other conventions for humanitarian purposes. These conventions do not stipulate any other supervision or any other sanctions other than moral sanctions." The Egyptian representative said: "Perhaps you still remember that when the First World War broke out, Britain, France, and Germany guaranteed not to use poison gas. At that time, although there was a convention prohibiting the use of poison gas, this convention had not been ratified by all countries." The Egyptian representative said this, and I would like to add on behalf of myself that this convention, for some mysterious reason, has not been ratified by the United States of America to this day, although it has been more than forty years since the convention was signed. I will now continue to quote the Egyptian representative's words: "Despite the so-called total war that occurred in Europe for the first time at that time, the three countries and other countries strictly adhered to the guarantee not to use poison gas."

The Egyptian representative said: "Because full supervision of the production of atomic weapons and using them for civilian purposes is a long-term and tedious process, why can't we find some ways to prohibit atomic weapons, at least to prohibit those existing atomic weapons, on the same basis?"

A representative of a small country expressed such opinions, and it has been suggested here that we should listen to the opinions of small countries. Therefore, our delegation fully supports and will always support these suggestions. Not only that, their opinions should be respected. Moreover, these countries should also be respected.

This is the best way to test whether one has a desire for peace or a desire for aggression. The gentlemen sitting to my right should also remember this. Especially them, and not only to Egypt, Mr. Lloyd.

How much time does it actually take to establish an international control system and to make the entire international control organization start operating? I do not intend to explore this issue in detail.

The Egyptian representative believes that establishing an international control organization to prohibit atomic weapons and making this control organization start operating is a long process. The American representatives also hold this view. Their speeches here often say how long this period should be. If, indeed, as the Egyptian representative said, and especially as the American representative said, this is really a long process, then it should be even more admitted that the prohibition of atomic weapons should not wait until the process of organizing this control organization is completed before it can be implemented. Because, if this is a very long process, it makes it even more reasonable to believe that the work of prohibiting atomic weapons cannot be tied to supervision and the organization of a control organization.

This is another argument in favor of our view. This is not only in favor of the Soviet view, but also in favor of the views of certain other delegations, which have expressed this view in their speeches and proposals.

It is absolutely impermissible if the work of organizing an international control organization to prohibit atomic weapons and making this organization start operating takes several months, or even several years, and the prohibition of atomic weapons has to wait until this control organization starts working before it can be implemented. Because in this way, the work of prohibiting atomic weapons, prohibiting the production and use of atomic weapons will really be indefinitely postponed. In this way, mankind will always be threatened by atomic war, and war may break out at any time.

We are not afraid of this situation. If we are talking about the Soviet Union, we have never been afraid of those who try to attack us, and we have never been afraid of those who actually attack us. We have never been afraid of them! However, we are a peaceful country, so we want to stop the danger of war that threatens mankind and may cause great disasters.

The Soviet delegation, on the one hand, defends its suggestion that the United Nations General Assembly should declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. On the other hand, it believes that all possible measures must be taken to shorten the period for establishing international supervision as much as possible. We even suggested the deadline for drafting the relevant convention—February 1, 1952—as early as a month and a half ago. We were told that this deadline was unrealistic.

Gentlemen, are you really concerned that this deadline is unrealistic? If you accept our suggestion, at least accept this suggestion in principle, then we can discuss this deadline. Please accept this suggestion, and then we can reach an agreement on the deadline issue. The deadline issue is not an obstacle. It is absurd to let such a major issue as the prohibition of atomic weapons depend on the deadline issue.

However, when you talk about "unrealistic deadlines," you think you have found Achilles' heel (the protagonist in a poem by the ancient Greek poet Homer, whose heel was his fatal weakness—Editor's Note), thinking that as long as you strike him here, you can defeat him entirely. However, you are very wrong. We are realists, so we say: Let us reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Jessup Confuses Black and White in an Attempt to Defend the United States' Failure to Fulfill International Agreements

Here, we let the United Nations General Assembly declare: Prohibit atomic weapons! However, you say: "We dare not guarantee ourselves, because we are not bound by supervision. We don't know if we can pass this test."

We dare to guarantee ourselves, and we can pass this test even if supervision has not yet been implemented. To confirm this, one must follow a famous British saying: "To know whether a pudding is good or not, you have to taste it," otherwise you can never know what it tastes like. However, you dare not guarantee yourselves. This will certainly cause serious doubts for those who want to deal with you, because everyone often thinks that anyone who undertakes a certain obligation should guarantee it for himself. However, you have not done this. To some extent, you may have reasons for doing this yourselves, because many resolutions have been passed in the past, and you have not been able to fulfill them. You have concluded many international agreements with others, and many have not been fulfilled. Is there any benefit in listing all the resolutions that you have passed but have not fulfilled?

However, Jessup here only lists two types of proposals: one type is the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation and rejected; the other type is the proposals passed against the will of the Soviet Union, in opposition to the Soviet Union, and therefore the Soviet Union did not fulfill them. However, he forgot a type of resolution, that is, the resolutions that the United States, Britain, and France voted in favor of, but they did not fulfill them later. I will talk about these later.

Now, I intend to remind you that the Baruch Plan, which is called a utopian plan, makes it easy to talk about international supervision, while ignoring the real issue of how to organize an international control organization and implement the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Now, from Jessup's recent speeches, it seems that he also dares not deny the moral, political, or even legal validity of the United Nations General Assembly's resolutions that we talked about last time.

However, he still opposes our suggestion, opposes the United Nations General Assembly declaring the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establishing international supervision. He says that it is impossible to pass such a suggestion before the control organization has been established and has not started working.

Jessup also knows the weakness of his argument, so he says that he can agree with the general saying that the United Nations General Assembly's resolutions have moral, political, and legal validity.

I have said that Mr. Jessup mentioned some of the previous resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, which are indeed of no moral or political validity to the Soviet Union, nor of any legal validity, although according to Jessup, these are major resolutions on peace and international security issues.

However, what we oppose is precisely this situation in the first place. We voted against these resolutions precisely because we doubted whether they were of any use to the cause of peace and international security. In other cases, we have not in the past and still do not recognize the legitimacy of these resolutions, for example, such as the shameful resolution on declaring the People's Republic of China as an aggressor, the resolution on using the United Nations in the armed intervention in Korea carried out by the United States in collusion with Syngman Rhee, and several other resolutions. We resolutely oppose these resolutions. We resolutely voted against them. It is simply absurd to ask us to fulfill these resolutions. Indeed, we are here to solve international problems, not to solve domestic problems. However, on international issues, a country cannot be forced to do something that it opposes. Moreover, the General Assembly is composed of sovereign and independent countries, although some of them do not implement their own policies, and cannot often express their own opinions. They are subjected to very strong pressure, and this pressure is for purposes that violate the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter. Mr. Jessup here confuses black and white. If we voted in favor of a certain resolution and then violated it later, then it would be justified to reprimand us.

Numerous Facts Prove That Violating UN General Assembly Resolutions and International Agreements Has Become a Habit of the United States

However, the actual situation is just the opposite. Let us talk about the third type of General Assembly resolution that Mr. Jessup deliberately omitted. The United States voted in favor of these resolutions, but did not fulfill them later. For example, did the United States fulfill the resolution of January 24, 1946, on studying the various problems caused by the discovery of atomic energy? No! There is another resolution, the resolution of December 14, 1946, on universally stipulating and reducing armaments and armed forces. Did the United States fulfill this resolution? No! We can also cite the resolution of November 3, 1947, on measures to be taken to stop the agitators of new wars. The United States did not fulfill this resolution either. As for us, the Soviet Union, whether in newspapers or in statements—I mean not only official statements but also ordinary conversations—you cannot see any remarks calling for a new war. What about you?

I have already talked about the very crazy propaganda carried out by your infamous "Collier's" magazine. Just listen to your radio, look at your newspapers, and listen to the speeches of all your speakers—these people are all the highest leaders of your country—you can see and hear countless war cries. We will discuss the issue of the $100 million appropriation later. Is there anything more shameless than your bill of October 10, 1951?

The resolution prohibiting war propaganda has been passed, but the United States is carrying out this propaganda on the largest scale. Its scale is getting bigger and bigger, forming a vast ocean. The Atlantic Ocean is just a cesspool compared to it!

The resolution on the extradition and punishment of war criminals, the resolution on the relationship between the United Nations member states and Spain, and the resolution on false and defamatory information—the United States has not fulfilled even one of these resolutions. As for various international agreements, what about the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement? You are going to say: It was not you who divided Germany into two. It was not you who established the Bonn puppet government. It was not you who dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Group and used it as a springboard for attack. Who are you attacking? You openly say that you are attacking the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Does this conform to various international agreements? Is this called respecting various international agreements? Is this called respecting the United Nations Charter? Does this conform to the resolutions that I have briefly listed here? Is this respecting the various resolutions of the General Assembly? Violating the various resolutions of the General Assembly and various international agreements has become your habit. You once called these agreements gentlemen's agreements! Here, the ugly business of forcibly inserting Greece into the Security Council is being carried out. We seem to have held seventeen votes, because the United States wants to elect Greece at all costs, although the United States has no legal basis for this matter. You may be able to achieve your goal, because unfortunately, the US dollar still has considerable power, and because some countries' general economic dependence on the United States is quite large, this dependence can still play a role!

The representatives of the North Atlantic Group dare to boldly promote respect for the various resolutions of the General Assembly to us, regardless of these facts and similar facts!

We concluded a gentlemen's agreement in 1946. We fulfilled this agreement meticulously. Everyone can see that it is the United States that violated this agreement. They violated the agreement, and they dare to say: They are not sure whether the Soviet Union will fulfill the resolutions it has signed. Please these gentlemen point out at least one resolution that we have signed and then violated later. Please show us this resolution. They cannot do this, but we can present the United States with dozens of such facts. Some delegations have proposed amendments to the "Three Powers" proposal, most of which are insignificant amendments. However, the Soviet delegation believes that there is an important amendment, which is worthy of close attention, that is, the amendment of the Egyptian delegation that I have already talked about.

The Soviet Union Supports Poland's Proposal to Establish an Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission under the Security Council

The Polish delegation put forward another amendment in the form of a proposal, suggesting the establishment of an Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission under the Security Council after the dissolution of the Atomic Energy Commission. The amendment also suggested that the Security Council dissolve the Conventional Armaments Commission. Poland's proposal suggested that the "Three Powers" proposal and the Soviet delegation's amendments to that proposal be submitted to the Atomic Energy and Conventional Armaments Commission.

The Soviet delegation believes that this suggestion is important and pertinent. The work of the Sub-Committee has shown that careful and patient study of the issues, especially the very important issues that our committee is now facing, will produce good results.

It is really impossible to deny that this is the first time we have reached an agreement during this period, although this is still on minor issues. More importantly, although there are sharp differences in principle between us and you—the United States, Britain, and France—both sides showed appropriate keenness, patience, and thoughtfulness in considering various issues, which, of course, cannot be ignored in solving major political issues.

This is why the Soviet delegation believes that the work of the Sub-Committee has shown that a comprehensive and patient study of the issues—especially such very important issues as I have said—will produce good results.

Chairman Naev of the Sub-Committee pointed out that although there were differences between the Soviet suggestion and the three-power proposal on some major issues—unfortunately, there were large and serious differences—the Sub-Committee still achieved some degree of agreement on some aspects of the plans put forward by both sides. He also pointed out that the Sub-Committee's consideration of these issues helped to expand the scope of agreement on certain issues, even on those minor issues.

Therefore, we have sufficient reason to support the Polish delegation's proposal. According to my understanding, this proposal is based on the point of view of making further effective efforts to obtain a generally agreed solution on the following issues: the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction of armaments and armed forces, and the establishment of an international control organization to ensure the implementation of resolutions in this regard.

The Soviet delegation has consistently strived for a generally agreed resolution. The Soviet delegation believes that as long as there is good faith, mutual respect, and sincere efforts to strengthen international cooperation and enhance international peace and security, a generally agreed resolution can be reached in the "Twelve-Nation" Committee. The Soviet delegation is working towards this goal. Therefore, we fully support the suggestion put forward by the Polish delegation. (Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th)

    关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和建立国际监督
    ——维辛斯基一九五一年十二月十八日在联合国大会政治委员会会议上的演说（续完）
    美英法三国修正案和原提案一样，没有肯定地说禁止原子武器
    “三国”修正提案的性质也是如此，我们在讨论这个提案的若干基本点时已证明了，这个提案不能解决与限制和裁减武装部队和军备有关的任何问题，更不能解决与禁止原子武器和建立严格的国际监督有关的问题。然而在这个问题上必须十分明确。苏联代表团正是从这种考虑出发，建议把下列一节列入“三国”提案中作为提案正文的第一节，这一节建议联合国大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立严格的国际监督以保证这个禁令得到遵守。关于这一点，苏联代表团建议大会责成原子能与常规军备委员会拟就公约草案提交安全理事会审议，这个公约草案应规定办法，保证大会关于禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、把已经制造出来的原子弹完全用于民用目的并建立严格国际监督以保证上述公约的实施的决议得以执行。
    苏联这些毫不含糊的、明白的、坚决的和确定的建议难道能和“三国”提案第三节所包含的附有各种保留和条件的含糊的、不确定的建议来相提并论吗？现在已经是明确认识这两种提案在原则上的根本不同的时候了。一方面，苏联这一方面提出了建议，主张宣布无条件禁止原子武器，建立严格的国际监督并在最短期间内起草公约规定保证实施这个禁令的办法。这是我们一方面的情形，苏联方面的情形。
    在另一方面，在美、英、法三国那一方面，它们既然没有关于禁止原子武器的声明，也没有关于建立国际监督的决定。同时，它们又说了不少的含糊其词的话，说什么命令原子能与常规军备委员会拟订建议，列入关于裁减一切武装部队和建立有效的监督以保证禁止原子武器之禁令的执行的条约里面。
    可是，应该监督实行的禁令在那里呢？你们说：这是不言自明的呀。那末请容许我们要求你们清楚地、确切地说一句：禁止原子武器。
    但是，美、英、法三国政府不敢用清楚而确切的语言肯定地说禁止原子武器。它们躲避这个问题。它们只说什么命令委员会草拟某种建议——而且这些建议还不是关于禁止原子武器，只是关于建立以禁止原子武器为目的的监督的。
    如果人们考虑到“禁止原子武器，建立监督以保证禁令的实施”这几句特别重要的话里面所包含的那种真正希望解决问题的心情，人们就会感到有人在这里开玩笑，采取完全不严肃的态度。这两句话虽然很短，却是特别重要的，亿万人民正在为这两句话斗争，尽管他们在路上遇到了种种的阴谋、诡计和抗拒，他们一定会在这个斗争中取得胜利，他们一定要克服而且无疑地能够胜利地克服这些阴谋、诡计和抗拒的。
    美英法对建立国际管制机构必须发表直接声明，不能含糊其词只作暗示
    苏联代表团还建议在“三国”提案中，加上苏联代表团所提出的关于在安全理事会范围内成立国际管制机构的一点新的建议。我们曾说，每一个主张大量裁减一切武装部队和军备的具有诚意的计划，都必须规定成立这种机构。苏联代表团在苏联代表团修正案原文第五节中间所提出来的新的第三项指出，这个机构的任务应该是“监督裁减一切种类的军备和武装部队的，并监督原子武器禁令的执行，以期这种禁令得以准确地、忠实地执行，而且这一个国际机构，必须公布关于一切武装部队（包括半军事部队、公安部队和警察部队在内）和一切军备
    （包括原子武器在内）的情报”，这一点又规定，根据上述的国际管制机构的决定，进行有效的国际调查，而且这种监督，应该包括对于所提出来的情报的审查。
    关于这个管制机构的真正目的、任务和职权（规定这个管制机构的权利和义务），还会有比我们的修正案说得更清楚的吗？
    为了不使人们对于成立国际管制机构的事有一点不了解的地方，苏联代表团建议，将来的公约应该规定由国际管制机构负责监督原子武器禁令的执行，也应该把管制机构的成分、权利和义务规定下来，并命令这一个机构在上述的公约缔结以后立即开始调查（也就是检查）一切生产和储存原子武器的设备，以判断禁止原子武器的公约是不是已予执行。
    我们的建议主张在这个公约缔结以后，不管这个国际管制机构是否已开始工作，立即进行调查，检查原子武器的生产和储存。提出“三国”提案的人们，对于我们这个建议，一句话都不说。他们宁愿避过这个问题。可是，这个建议是非常重要的。这个建议证明苏联不主张也不打算把禁止原子武器的事拖延到更迟的阶段或最后的阶段——巴鲁区计划却是这样规定的，美、英、法三国代表也是这样主张的。
    我必须谈到另外一个情况。小组委员会主席纳孚的备忘录说（见俄文本第九页），三国认为，它们的提案中，已经暗含着成立管制机构的意思了。
    可是为什么仅仅暗含着这种意思呢？美、英、法三国政府为什么一方面慷慨激昂地说解决禁止原子武器的全部问题的真正关键正是这种机构，而另一方面又仅仅暗含着成立这种机构的意思呢？小组委员会主席的备忘录中不也说只有苏联的修正案才直接地提到了必须成立国际管制机构的事吗？
    可是——我顺便提一下——在小组委员中，三国之间有一国非常顽固地反对把这半句话加在纳孚先生的备忘录里面。我们费了好大的力气去证明真理是真理，备忘录应该反映真实情况。于是我就要求把“三国”提案中谈到成立国际管制机构的一点指给我看。可是那是指不出来的，因为它是不存在的。
    这难道不是一个有典型意义的情况吗？
    美、英、法三国的代表愿意暗示许多事情。他们暗示成立国际管制机构，他们暗示禁止原子武器——他们是很愿意暗示的——他们在这一方面，倒是做得很够的。可是必要的不是暗示，而是发表直接的声明，这一点正是他们设法避免的。
    他们说，我们不能担保自己；他们说，如果大会通过了禁止原子武器的决定而不对我们实行监督，例如国际监督，那么我们就不能担保自己。
    但是我们是能够担保自己的，即使没有监督，我们也会执行这个决定。请接受这个决定吧！
    美英法提案的结论不言自明，三国拒绝无条件禁止原子武器
    耶塞普先生说第四节是新加的。它包含的意思和苏联修正案第五节一样；像他们修正的第三节乙项
    一样，它明白规定原来的三国提案中即已很清楚表达的意思，即必须建立国际管制机构以保证执行裁军计划。
    但是我们来看看修正的第三节乙项，其中并没有说起建立管制机构，只是在关于调查的那一句话里面间接谈到它。照这一项规定，应该根据正在建立的国际管制机构的决定进行这种调查。
    但是我可以说你是在玩弄字句。这里也提到，那里也提到正在建立的国际管制机构。照这样说法，你可以说凡是可以建立的都是正在建立着。说根据正在建立的管制机构的决定来进行调查——这绝对不等于决定建立这样的机构。如果它的确等于这个意思，那么为什么不明白地提出来，为什么不消灭含糊其词和模棱两可的现象？在这种情况下，为什么不明确地说明管制机构正在建立中？但是不论在我此地提到的第三节中、或是任何其他地方、或是就在这修正提案的新的第四节中，你都找不到建立这种机构的建议。这个真正新的第四节主张命令委员会草拟计划以便在安全理事会的范围内建立国际管制机构。话是这样讲的：草拟计划，以便在安全理事会范围内建立国际管制机构。但是必须注意的是，这一点同样也没有讲到建立国际管制机构这件事的本身。因此，我们在此地并没有听到对于这个问题的明确的、肯定的声明，他们仍然是在避开问题。
    根据上面所说的，结论就可以不言自明了：美、英、法三国政府拒绝了无条件禁止原子武器的建议，说得更确切些，拒绝了那个主张由大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器的建议，它们避免直接承当建立国际管制机构的义务，所以在这个问题上用一些复杂的、含糊的字句来掩饰它们的真正意图。苏联代表团新提出的第三项和“三国”修正提案的第三节乙项两者之间不但措词不同、提法不同，在实质上也有极大的不同。这种不同也就决定了我们之间的分歧。
    如果“三国”提案的拟订者真正希望公约里面提到建立国际管制机构，那末没有任何东西可以阻止他们这样做。公约中是必须提到建立国际管制机构的。但是他们不这样做。这样做的却是我们、苏联代表团，这里就是我们的建议的优越地方。
    美国巴鲁区计划所以不能被接受是它威胁到各民族和国家的主权
    十二月十五日，耶塞普先生好像发过三次言。在他十二月十五日的第三次发言中，耶塞普先生表现了他很会插科打诨，他花了不小的力量想博得第一委员会的一笑，他在第一委员会上讲到一辆黄金色的车子，六十只白色的鸽子拉着车子、还有魔杖和美女。耶塞普先生显然已把事物混淆起来，或许他觉得他已不是在政治委员会，而是在围绕着圣诞树跳舞的儿童们中间了。（笑声）圣诞节真正快来到了。不过这对于第一委员会倒并不怎样危险。可是耶塞普先生在诙谐了一番以后，即在他又来分析第一委员会所讨论的严重问题的时候，他还没有换一个严肃的语调。
    老实说，我们是不是可以郑重对待耶塞普先生的话呢，他说：苏联代表团在关于无条件禁止原子武器和准备一项公约规定各项措施以保证实行这个公约的修正案里，一共有两段：第一段讲到禁止原子武器和建立监督，第二段讲到命令委员会拟订有关公约的草案。照他说来，这就意味着两个问题之间只有一点点关系，因此秘而不宣的目的是想在宣布禁止原子武器以后避免建立国际监督。
    耶塞普先生责怪苏联五年来一直反对巴鲁区计划，没有表示转圜的余地。但是美国五年来一直坚持这个计划——它又表示过什么转圜的余地呢？他们说这是最好不过的计划，说没有再好的计划了——虽然他们也作了这样的保留：“如果有更好的计划，我们愿意想一想。”但是他们事先早已知道不会有更好的计划的，因为他们认为这是一切可能想出的计划中的最好的一个。他们坚持这个巴鲁区计划，他们继续顽固地坚持这个计划，虽然这个计划已经受到各方面的种种理由充分的和认真的批评。我举事实出来。甚至像英国“泰晤士报”这种报纸也说，巴鲁区计划是乌托邦计划。因此，除非抱着根本不要计划的目的，否则，为这个计划进行辩护是没有意义的。
    美国、英国、法国的论据是这样的。他们说：“但是你们自己也坚持要依照你们的办法——不要巴鲁区计划而接受苏联的计划。”那么。就让我们来研究一下我们为什么不要你们的计划的理由。因为这个计划使所谓国际管制机构成为美国的超级托辣斯，使一个国家的整个经济从属于它，移交给它。这个国家的整个命运因此将被这个国际管制机构的决定所专横地支配。这个国际管制机构，即使用这个计划的拥护者的话来说，也只能说是实行美利坚合众国的政策的机构。这个计划威胁到各民族和国家的主权。因此尊重自己国家与自己人民的主权的人们是不能同意这个计划的。巴鲁区计划之所以不能接受，正是因为它威胁到各民族和国家的主权。它之所以不能接受还因为它是没有结果的，它把最重要的事拖延到最后几个阶段，而且还取决于若干条件，而这些条件则完全要看你们是否高兴而定。
    如果提到分阶段，提到管制机构根据巴鲁区计划对一切原子原料和一切原子企业、甚至与原子工业有关的企业的所有权，那么便可以清楚地看出，这个计划当然不能为那些并不希望自杀的国家接受的。
    苏联支持埃及的意见，但苏联认为禁止原子武器不应等到建立国际管制机构过程完成以后
    耶塞普先生像从前一样说，苏联只在纸上建议禁止原子武器。但是我们早已指出这种反对的意见是虚妄的和没有根据的。埃及代表在其十二月十五日的演说中也指出了这一点，我认为今天在委员会的会员国各位代表面前把他的话重复一遍并不是多余的。
    埃及代表说：“要建立机构以监督原子武器的生产并且把一切原子能用于民用目的（这也是监督），不费很多时间几乎是不可能的。”埃及代表问道：
    “在这期间我们应该做些什么工作呢？我们不能把生产原子武器、管制这些武器和原子能，与实际使用这些武器区分开来。”他说：“我们有许多公约，例如红十字会公约，禁止使用毒气公约，以及许多为了人道目的的其他公约。这些公约除了道义制裁外不规定任何其他的监督或任何其他的制裁。”埃及代表说：“也许你们还记得，第一次世界大战开战时，英国、法国和德国保证不使用毒气。当时虽有禁止使用毒气的公约，但是这个公约并没有得到所有国家的批准。”埃及代表这么说，我愿意代表我个人补充一句，这个公约为了某种神秘的原因直到现在还没有得到美利坚合众国的批准，虽然这个公约签订以来已有四十多年了。我现在继续引述埃及代表的话：“尽管欧洲当时第一次发生所谓总体战，三国以及其他国家仍严格遵守不使用毒气的保证。”
    埃及代表说：“因为充分监督原子武器的生产和把它们用在民用的目的上，是长期的和令人厌倦的过程，我们为什么不能在同样的基础上找到一些禁止原子武器，至少是禁止那些已有的原子武器的办法呢？”
    一个小国的代表发表了这样的意见，而且曾经有人在这里建议应该倾听小国的意见，因此，我国代表团完全支持而且将来也永远支持这些建议。这还不够，他们的意见应该得到尊重。而且，这些国家也应该得到尊重。
    这是试验究竟是抱着爱好和平的愿望还是侵略愿望的最好办法。坐在我的右边的先生们也应该记住这一点。特别是他们，而且不仅是对于埃及，劳埃德先生。
    实际需要多少时候才能建立国际管制制度，才能够使整个国际管制机构开始活动呢？这个问题我不打算详细探讨了。
    埃及代表认为，要建立禁止原子武器的国际管制机构并使这管制机构开始活动，是一个长期的过程。美国代表也持这样的意见，他们在这里的发言常常说这个时期该有多么多么长。假如，的确如埃及代表所说的那样，特别是如美国代表所说的那样，这真是一个长期的过程，那就更加应该承认，禁止原子武器不应等到这个组织管制机构的过程完成之后才实行。因为，假如这是一个拖得很久的过程，那就使人们更加有理由认为，不能够把禁止原子武器这工作和监督以及组织管制机构束缚在一起。
    这又是一个有利于我们的见解的论点，这不仅是有利于苏联的见解，而且也有利于其他某些代表团的见解，它们已在发言和提案中表示了这种见解。
    假如组织禁止原子武器的国际管制机构以及使这机构开始活动的工作拖那么几个月，甚至拖几年，而禁止原子武器又要等这个管制机构开始工作之后才能实行，那是绝对不能允许的。因为这样一来，禁止原子武器、禁止原子武器的生产及使用的工作就真要遥遥无期了，这样人类就会经常受到原子战争的威胁，战争随时都可能爆发。
    我们并不害怕这种情况，假如我们谈的是苏联的话，我们从来不害怕那些企图攻击我们的人，也从来不害怕实际上攻击我们的人。我们从来就不怕他们！但是，我们是和平的国家，因此我们要制止威胁着人类并可能造成极大灾祸的战争危险。
    苏联代表团一方面为它的建议辩护，主张联合国大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器，另一方面并认为必须采取一切可能的措施，以把建立国际监督的期限尽可能缩短。我们甚至早在一个半月以前就建议草拟有关公约的期限——一九五二年二月一日。有人告诉我们说，我们这个期限不切合实际。
    诸位先生们，你们的确很关心这个期限不切合实际吗？如果你们接受我们的建议，至少在原则上接受这建议，那我们便可以讨论这个期限。请接受这建议罢，那样我们便可以在期限问题上取得协议，期限问题并不是什么障碍。假如我们让禁止原子武器这样重大的问题取决于期限问题，那是荒谬可笑的。
    但是，当你们谈到“不切合实际的期限”时，你们以为你们找到了阿基理斯的足跟（古希腊诗人荷马一篇诗中的主角，足跟是他的致命弱点——编者注），以为只要打击他这里，就可以把他整个打倒。然而，你们是大错特错了。我们是现实主义者，因此我们说：让我们在禁止原子武器问题上取得协议。
    耶塞普混淆黑白企图为美国不履行国际协议作辩解
    这里，我们让联合国大会宣布：禁止原子武器！然而你们说：“我们不敢担保自己，因为我们并没有受到监督的约束，我们不晓得我们是不是能通过这个考验。”
    我们就敢担保自己，即使监督还没有实行，我们也能通过这个考验。为了证实这一点，必须遵照一个有名的英国格言：“要想知道布丁的好坏，就要尝它一下”，否则你怎样也不能知道它是什么滋味的。但是，你们不敢担保自己。这当然会使那些想和你们打交道的人产生严重的疑虑，因为每一个人经常都以为，任何人要是承担某种义务，是应该为自己保证的。但是你们没有这样。在某种程度上说，你们自己这样办也许是有理由的，因为过去曾经通过了许多决议，你们都没有能够履行。你们曾经和别人缔结过许多国际协议，也有很多没有履行。把一切你们通过而没有履行的决议都一一列举出来，是不是有什么好处呢？
    然而，耶塞普这里却只列举两类提案：一类是苏联代表团提出而被拒绝了的；另一类是违反苏联的意志、在苏联的反对之下通过的，因而苏联没有履行的。但是，他却忘记了一类决议，就是美国、英国和法国都投票赞成而后来它们却没有履行的决议。关于这些，我以后还要谈到。
    现在，我打算提醒一下，那个被叫做乌托邦计划的巴鲁区计划使人们可以轻易地空谈国际监督，而忽视了真正如何组织国际管制机构并实行禁止原子武器的问题。
    现在，从耶塞普最近的发言看来，似乎他也不敢否认我们上次谈到的联合国大会的决议在道义上、政治上或甚至法律上的效力。
    然而，他仍然反对我们的建议，反对联合国大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立国际监督。他说，在管制机构还没有设立、没有开始工作以前，是不可能通过这种建议的。
    耶塞普同时也知道他的主张的脆弱无力，所以他说，他可以同意认为联合国大会的决议具有道义、政治和法律效力的一般说法。
    我已经说过，耶塞普先生提到联合国大会以前的某些决议，这些的确是对苏联既无道义和政治效力，也无法律效力的，虽然据耶塞普说，这些是关于和平和国际安全问题的重大决议。
    但是，我们所反对的首先就正是这一种情况。我们投票反对这些决议正是因为我们怀疑它们对和平事业与国际安全是不是有什么用处。在另外一些情况下，我们过去不而且现在仍然不承认这些决议的合法性，举例说，如像关于宣布中华人民共和国为侵略者的可耻决议，关于在美国勾结李承晚对朝鲜进行的武装干涉中利用联合国的决议以及其他的若干决议。我们断然反对这些决议。我们断然投票反对它们。要求我们来履行这些决议简直是荒谬的。的确，我们到这里来是要来解决国际问题的，而不是解决国内问题的。但是，在国际问题上，一个国家不能被迫去做它所反对的某种事情。而且，大会是由主权独立的国家组成的，虽然它们中间有一些国家并不是执行它们自己的政策，甚至不能经常表示它们自己的意见，它们遭受到非常强大的压力，这种压力是为了与联合国宪章的原则与规定相违反的目的的。耶塞普先生在这里混淆了黑白。如果我们投票拥护过某个决议而后来又违反了它，那末，斥责我们是正当的。
    无数次事实证明：违反联大决议和国际协议已成美国的习惯
    但是，实际情况却恰恰相反，我们来谈一谈耶塞普先生故意略而不谈的第三类大会决议。美国曾投票拥护这些决议，而后来又没有履行。举例说，如一九四六年一月二十四日关于研究因原子能的发现而引起的各种问题的决议，美国是不是履行了这个决议呢？没有！还有另外一个决议，就是一九四六年十二月十四日关于普遍规定与裁减军备和武装部队的决议。美国是不是履行了这个决议呢？没有！还可以再举出一九四七年十一月三日关于为制止新战争鼓动者而采取的措施的决议。美国也没有履行这个决议。至于我们苏联，不管是在报纸上还是在声明中——我指的不仅是官方声明而且还是普通的谈话，你们都看不到要求新战争的言论。而你们是怎样呢？
    我已经谈到过你们声名狼藉的“柯里尔”杂志所进行的十分疯狂的宣传。只要听一听你们的无线电，看一看你们的报纸，听一听你们所有演说人的发言——这些人都是你们国家最高的负责人——你们就可以看见和听到无数的战争叫嚣。我们以后将讨论一亿美元拨款的问题，有任何事能比你们一九五一年十月十日的法案更不要脸的吗？
    不许进行战争宣传的决议已经通过了，但是美国却以最大规模来进行这种宣传，它的规模越来越大，形成了汪洋大海，大西洋和它比起来只不过是一个污水潭而已！
    关于引渡和惩罚战犯的决议，联合国会员国和西班牙关系的决议，关于假的和诽谤性的情报的决议——对于这些决议，美国连一个也没有履行。至于各种国际协定，雅尔塔协定，波茨坦协定又是怎么样呢？你们将要说：把德国分裂为二的不是你们，成立波恩傀儡政府的不是你们，把西德拖入北大西洋集团，用它来作为进攻的跳板的，也不是你们。向谁进攻呢？你们公开地说，向苏联、向各人民民主国家进攻。难道这符合各种国际协定吗？这就是叫做尊重各种国际协定吗？这就是所谓尊重联合国宪章吗？难道这符合我刚才在这里简单列举出来的决议吗？难道这是尊重大会的各种决议吗？违反大会各种决议和各种国际协定已成了你们的习惯，你们曾一度把这些协定叫做君子协定哩！这里正进行强把希腊安插进安全理事会的丑事。我们好像已经举行过十七次投票了，这是因为美国不惜任何代价要把希腊选出来，尽管美国对此事并没有任何合法根据。你们或许能够达到目的，因为不幸的是，美元仍然有不小的力量，因为某些国家对美国的一般经济依赖是相当大的，这种依赖是仍然可以发生作用的！
    北大西洋集团的代表们居然不顾这些事实和类似的事实，大胆地向我们宣扬尊重大会的各种决议！
    我们在一九四六年缔结了君子协定。我们丝毫不苟地履行这个协定。大家都可以看得见，违反这个协定的正是美国。他们违反了协定，还敢说：他们不敢肯定苏联会不会履行它所签订的决议。请这些先生们至少指出一个我们签过字的而后来我们又违反了的决议吧。请他们把这个决议指给我们看看。他们是不能做到这一点的，可是我们能向美国提出几十件那样的事实。有些代表团对“三国”提案提出了修正案，其中大多数都是无关紧要的修正案。但是苏联代表团认为有一个修正案是重要的修正案，是值得十分注意的，那就是我已经谈过的埃及代表团的修正案。
    苏联支持波兰建议在安理会下设立原子能和常规军备委员会
    波兰代表团以提案形式提出了另一个修正案，建议在原子能委员会解散后，在安全理事会下面设立原子能与常规军备委员会。该修正案同时建议安全理事会解散常规军备委员会。波兰的提案建议把“三国”提案与苏联代表团提出的对该提案的修正案提交原子能与常规军备委员会。
    苏联代表团认为，这个建议是重要而中肯的。小组委员会的工作已经说明，仔细地、耐心地研究问题，特别是像我们的委员会现在所面临的这种十分重要的问题，是会产生良好的结果的。
    实在也不可能否认这是在这个期间我们首次达成协议，尽管这还是在次要问题上达成协议。更重要的是虽然我们与你们——美国、英国、法国——之间存在着尖锐的原则分歧，双方在考虑各种问题的时候表现出适当的敏锐、耐心和周到，这些在解决首要的政治问题的时候当然是不能忽视的。
    这就是为什么苏联代表团认为小组委员会的工作已经说明了，全面地、耐心地研究问题——特别是如我所说的这样十分重要的问题，是会产生良好结果的。
    小组委员会主席纳孚先生指出，虽然苏联的建议与三国的提案在一些首要的问题上存在着分歧——不幸地是存在着很大与严重的分歧——小组委员会仍在双方所提出的方案的一些方面获得了某种程度的协议；他又指出，小组委员会对这些问题的考虑有助于扩大在某些问题上、即使是在那些次要问题上的协议范围。
    因此，我们有充分理由支持波兰代表团的提案，根据我的了解，这个提案是从为了在下述问题上取得大家同意的解决办法而作进一步的有效努力的观点出发的，这些问题是：无条件禁止原子武器，裁减军备与武装部队，建立国际管制机构以保证实行这方面的决议。
    苏联代表团一贯是为求得大家同意的决议而努力的。苏联代表团相信只要善意地、互相尊重地、真诚地来为巩固国际间的合作、加强国际和平与安全而努力，在“十二国”委员会上是能够达成这种大家同意的决议的，苏联代表团正在为此而努力。所以我们完全支持波兰代表团所提出的建议。（新华社据塔斯社巴黎十九日电）
