    Ningbo Wanxin Yarn Factory Xu Yonglian Reading Group
    Uses Newspaper Reading to Promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
    To the Editor: The Xu Yonglian reading group of the Class A spinning section of the No. 1 Factory of Ningbo Wanxin Yarn Factory has been promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method since November 10th. At the beginning, some workers did not understand the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method. An older worker, Mother Lu Guixiang, said: "The new work method is similar to the old work method, except that the new work method makes the machines cleaner!" Xu Yonglian, addressing the conservative thinking of the masses, explained in detail the advantages of the Hao Jianxiu work method as reported in the newspaper, as well as the experiences of other factories after its promotion. In the first few times of implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method, many difficulties were encountered because everyone did not quite understand it and could not grasp the time. Later, these difficulties were overcome through the division of labor and cooperation of all the workers in the group. Now, the rate of leather roller lapping in this group has been greatly reduced, and the roving ends are only four liang per machine, a reduction of 50 percent compared to the past.

    宁波万信纱厂徐永连读报小组
    用读报方式推广郝建秀工作法
    编辑同志：宁波万信纱厂第一厂甲班细纱间徐永连读报小组，从十一月十日起推广郝建秀工作法。开始时，有些工人不了解郝建秀工作法的精神。老年工人陆桂香妈妈说：“新派工作法和老派工作法差不多，只不过新派工作法把车子弄得清爽一点罢了！”徐永连针对群众的保守思想，把报上登载的关于郝建秀工作法的优点，以及其他厂推广后的经验，详细地解释了一遍。当实施郝建秀工作法的头几次，因大家不太了解和不会掌握时间，遇到了不少困难。后来，由于全组工人实行了分工合作，这些困难都被克服了。现在，这个小组的皮辊花率已大见降低，粗纱头每台车只四两，比过去减少了百分之五十。
