Editor's Note: The experience of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the rectification experiment can be used for reference in various places. After the rectification of the four branches of a factory in Tangshan, the consciousness of the party members was significantly improved, the role of the party in the masses was greatly strengthened, and the branch appearance was brand new. Most party members can recognize their main problems based on the standards of party members and often use them to check their thoughts and work. The party's prestige among the masses has been further enhanced. The masses reacted: "Rectification is good, rectification has changed every party member." Because these achievements have influenced other branches, other branches have also requested rectification as soon as possible. The experience of the Tangshan Municipal Committee in the rectification experiment shows that the rectification process is also a process of educating party members. The content of education must be combined with the thinking of party members, develop criticism and self-criticism, and continuously improve the ideological awareness of party members. At the same time, in the movement, we must pay great attention to discovering, educating, and cultivating activists, which is one of the important methods to lead the rectification work.

(1) Typical Branch Situations and Rectification Mobilization

    The rectification experiment in Tangshan City was conducted by the Municipal Committee, which transferred ten cadres to form four working groups in cooperation with the factory and mine party committees, and under the direct leadership of the Organization Department of the Municipal Committee, using four branches such as a factory as a typical rectification. The four branches have a total of one hundred and fourteen party members, including ninety-five formal party members and nineteen alternate party members. Eight joined the party before liberation, fifteen joined between May and August 1949, sixty-five joined between September 1949 and February 1950, and twenty-six joined after March 1950. Family background: sixteen workers, seven hired peasants, seventy-seven poor peasants, eight middle peasants, two rich peasants, one landlord, two urban poor, and one staff member. Personal composition: one hundred and eleven workers, three staff members.

    At the beginning of the rectification, the mobilization of the rectification study was first carried out: explaining the purpose, requirements, and methods of rectification. Most party members expressed their willingness to study and were full of enthusiasm. Some branches automatically formulated study covenants: "No absenteeism (no delay in production), no truancy, no lateness, obey leadership, study with peace of mind, and unite and help each other." Some party members happily said: "Rectification study should have been carried out long ago, otherwise, my thinking is always confused and I can't make progress." "Rectification study should be carried out once or twice a year for faster progress!" However, a few party members were unwilling to study, emphasizing family difficulties and lack of time. Some attempted to vent personal grudges to rectify others, some were waiting to be rectified, and some didn't care. These incorrect understandings were generally corrected after criticism in the discussion.

   (2) Studying the Nature of the Party

    I. Before the lectures, most party members believed that "the Communist Party is good, it is for the benefit of the working class, and workers were liberated and became masters only after the Communist Party came." Regarding whose party the party is, a few party members, because they had studied in party training classes or职工 schools, could talk about the Communist Party being the political party of the working class, generated on the basis of the workers' movement, and knew that "the Communist Party is the party of the working class because workers are an advanced class, the most revolutionary and organized," but could not explain the reason further. Most party members did not receive much party education, and some did not know at all whose party the Communist Party was; some even thought that "future production and construction cannot be separated from workers, so the Communist Party is called the working class party." Because many of the party members were from peasant families, and still have semi-agricultural and semi-industrial families, and also because our party had been in the countryside for a long time and led the peasants in land reform, they believed that "the Communist Party is the party of the peasants." Some people said: "The Communist Party used to be the party of the peasants in the countryside, and now it is the party of the workers in the city, wherever it is." "The Communist Party distributes land to peasants, increases wages to workers, and provides relief to the unemployed and disaster victims. Peasants, workers, and disaster victims are all poor people, anyway, it is the party of the poor, not the party of the rich."

    II. Studying the nature of the party was conducted mainly through lectures combined with discussions. In the process, we explored the following experiences:

    1. The content of the lectures and the requirements for learning must be based on the ideological level of the party members, starting from their actual ideological awareness and guiding them to improve step by step. The central issue in studying the nature of the party is to make them understand whose party the Communist Party of China is. Only by solving this problem can we further solve the problem of the Chinese Communist Party being the vanguard of the working class.

    After the liberation of Tangshan, under the leadership of the party, the working class became the masters of the country politically and their lives were greatly improved. They recognized that the Communist Party was good. Therefore, we should start from this ideological foundation and explain that if the working class wants to thoroughly turn over, it must develop production, nationalize industry, collectivize agriculture, and gradually achieve a communist society. This is the party's goal and the greatest interest and most beautiful future of the working class. Then, explain that the Chinese Communist Party is the representative of the interests of the working class and is the party of the working class. This kind of explanation that connects with the actual life of workers is easily accepted by workers.

    From the difference in production methods, explain the difference between the peasant class and the working class (of course, they are the same in opposing feudalism and demanding democracy). Explain that our party leads the peasants to carry out land reform, but it is not the party of the peasants, because in the future, when agriculture is collectivized, the peasants will eventually become people who are not much different from workers, so it is still the party of the working class.

    2. Regarding the issue of the Chinese Communist Party being the advanced force of the Chinese working class, generally, it can only be recognized that party members should be active in production and play an exemplary role. Therefore, further guidance to the standards of party members and comparing party members with non-party workers will make them easier to accept and facilitate ideological improvement. However, it is not easy to succeed in abstractly talking about mastering Marxism-Leninism and understanding the laws of social development, which is too demanding.

    3. When lecturing, each time can solve one problem, do not talk about many problems. Because everyone's cultural level is relatively low, if you talk too much, you can't remember it just by brain power, and it is easy to forget afterwards. The way of speaking should be simple and not use many unfamiliar terms.

    4. There are not many people in a branch, and the way of lecturing should be more lively and the time should be shorter. You can take the method of explaining a problem and discussing a problem, or explaining and asking and answering questions, so as to facilitate solving problems through their own thinking.

    III. After two or three days of study, from the test results, 70% to 80% of the people answered well, and generally understood from simple principles that the Communist Party is the party of the working class, and can say this: "In the past, the working class was oppressed and had to rise up in revolution. How to revolutionize? Is it okay to divide the factory? No, you have to have communism. Communism without leadership is not okay, you have to organize a headquarters, and the headquarters is the Communist Party organized by the conscious and outstanding elements of the working class."

    Regarding the Chinese Communist Party being the vanguard of the Chinese working class, most people know that party members should have a long-term vision and grasp the correct policies. Ding Bingzhi said: "The party is an unsung hero, the party gives ideas and thinks of ways in the trade union. If the ideas are good, everyone will like to listen to them. This is being the vanguard!" Zhang Xinghan said: "In the past, I thought that good production and being a model were enough; now I know that it is not enough to be a communist party member if you only know how to produce."

    However, a few party members, due to their lack of motivation and family琐事 affecting their study, and the leadership's individual education and mutual assistance were not tight enough, so their study harvest was not great, and they still could not clearly explain why the Chinese Communist Party is the party of the Chinese working class.

    (3) Studying the Party's Current Tasks and Ultimate Goals

    After studying the nature of the party, we studied the current tasks and ultimate goals of the Chinese Communist Party. A few party members had studied in职工 schools and party training classes and had a general concept of communist society. They knew that communist society had no oppression and no exploitation, abolished private ownership, and production forces developed to the highest degree, "each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." China must go through the stage of building a new democratic society before it can reach socialism and communism. Most party members also knew about communism, but there were many confused and wrong understandings: some people thought that "communism is eating from the same pot, not dividing yours and mine," "you have what I have, and everything is the same to eat and wear, and everything is averaged"; some thought that "do whatever you want, stay if you don't want to work"; some thought that "machines are used everywhere, one machine is worth hundreds of people, there are so many Chinese people, what are they going to do, isn't this trouble," "communism only eats good things, who eats grains"!

    After analyzing the ideological situation of party members, we believed that the central issue of this lesson was to give everyone a preliminary understanding of communism and eliminate confused ideas. Therefore, when explaining, we generally explained the characteristics of socialist society and communist society, focusing on clarifying that communism is to eliminate private ownership of the means of production, and explaining that the rich wealth of communist society is because of the highly developed production forces, which are created by labor, labor is conscious, and labor has become the urgent need of the people, so people at that time cannot have lazy thoughts and behaviors.

    In order to make them more deeply and concretely understand socialist society, we should introduce the life and production of Soviet workers as much as possible in the form of storytelling.

    After talking about communism - the party's ultimate goal, everyone realized that communist society is beautiful and happy, and increased their yearning. Under this ideological sentiment, from the current situation in China, it was explained that the Chinese revolution must go through two stages: currently, we must strive to build a new democratic society, unite four friends, eliminate three enemies, resist the U.S. and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, develop production, and prosper the economy, so that the agricultural country can be transformed into an industrial country, so as to transition to socialist society and further transition to communist society.

    After explanation and discussion, everyone generally had a rough understanding of the party's ultimate goal. They knew that communist society eliminates private ownership, has no classes, no exploitation and oppression, production uses machines, and productivity is greatly improved. The various erroneous understandings of communism were also generally criticized and corrected, such as saying: "In the past, I always couldn't figure it out, you like to eat rice and I like to eat white flour, the requirements are different, how can we eat from the same pot, now I know that the past ideas were too ridiculous." "Labor is glorious, wealth is created by labor, only big bellies (landlords) are unwilling to labor! Those who like to eat and are lazy cannot reach communist society."

    Everyone knew more about the party's current tasks, and some expressed their determination to say: "We must work hard and produce more." "When the party needs us, we will put down our tools and pick up our guns." One party member (old worker) said: "I am old, and I will mobilize my son to go to Korea to fight the American devils."

    Although this lesson has been very rewarding, due to the short time, large amount of content, and poor acceptance ability of party members, it can only achieve a general and incomplete understanding. The elimination of the opposition between physical and mental labor and the disappearance of state power are not easily accepted by party members, such as if they are talked about, some party members will have confused thoughts. In addition, the lecturers do not know much about the Soviet Union's production and people's lives, so they cannot use more concrete and vivid materials to explain the situation of socialism. Abstractly explaining the problem inevitably makes it difficult for the listeners to understand.
(4) Studying the Idea of Fighting for Communism for Life and the Party's Interests Above All Else

    After studying the party's ultimate goal, education on fighting for the cause of communism for life and the party's interests above all else was carried out. The study of these two lessons, first of all, combined with the problems existing in their thoughts and work, carried out concise and clear explanations. In the discussion, it is necessary to connect with reality, expand ideological inspection, and conduct analysis and criticism. In this inspection, a few people have ideological concerns and poor criticism; generally, they are honest and expose many problems. After analysis and criticism, the awareness of ordinary party members has generally improved, and their determination to be a party member for life and overcome their shortcomings has also increased.

    In studying the struggle for the cause of communism for life, their motives for joining the party were examined. Judging from the materials talked about, almost no one's motive for joining the party was completely pure. A few people received education before joining the party, had some understanding of the party, and their motives for joining the party had components of serving the people and realizing communism, but personal motives still accounted for a large proportion; most party members joined the party for personal advancement and personal interests. Some joined the party because "they have gained personal interests since liberation, and they saw that the Communist Party is good and supported the Communist Party's claims"; some saw that "the whole of China has become the Communist Party's world, there is no wrong way to join the Communist Party, and there must be benefits." "Joining the party is easy to get ahead, speaking is also confident, not subject to control, and can also control others." "Small workers have security, will not lose their jobs, and can also be promoted; being a foreman or a cadre earns more wages." A party member from a peasant family joined the party "in order not to pay rent, and to divide more land during land reform, and the village can treat him differently." Some joined the party "because they saw that the Communist Party was good to the poor, and even if there were no great benefits after joining the party, there would not be much harm." Some also joined the party "because they had personal grudges with others and were afraid of revenge, and after joining the party, they could take the opportunity to vent their personal grudges and rectify others." A few people did not have the desire to join the party, but were forcibly pulled into the party by the introducer, and a few others joined the party in order to escape land reform, fear struggle, and conceal historical (reactionary parties and evil deeds) problems, looking for a talisman, pretending to be active.

    In studying the party's interests above all else, the relationship between the individual and the party was examined. A few better party members obey the leadership of the organization, are actively responsible, implement the party's resolutions, and abide by the party's discipline; but most party members have a poor sense of organization, cannot put the party's interests above personal interests, their emotions fluctuate, do not regularly participate in organizational life, are afraid of delaying their personal affairs, when meetings are called, they sneak out through the back door, are unwilling to pay party dues, and in participating in party classes, some think that "they have no culture, are old, delay family work, and can't remember, a blind man lights a lamp in vain." Some are not active in party work, such as saying: "I serve the people, who serves me?" "I do work for the party, who will do the work at home for me?" "Doing work and being scolded by the masses, it's thankless, it doesn't fit together." Some even have the idea of ​​withdrawing from the party.

    Once the above ideas were exposed, they aroused everyone's inner struggle, and after analysis and criticism, the right and wrong were clarified, and thus a general step was taken in ideological improvement. They understood that a communist party member should not compromise and retreat, and "revolutionize" halfway, and should fight for communism to the end, and personal interests should be subordinate to the party's interests. They recognized that the party's cause is glorious, great, and very arduous. As long as there is determination, all difficulties can be overcome. Without the Communist Party's indomitable heroic struggle, there would be no victory today, nor would there be a future communist society. For example, party member Guo Engui said: "I saw that the Communist Party was good and joined the party, but after joining the party, I felt that the meetings were too troublesome and delayed my own affairs, so I negatively wanted to withdraw from the party. Now I realize that I am really not qualified to be a party member. If everyone was like me, the Chinese revolution would have failed long ago. In the future, I will definitely be determined to fight for communism to the end." Fan Xiaoshan said: "In the past, I had the idea of ​​changing the world and was indecisive. After joining the party, I was afraid of losing my head when the Kuomintang came. If I continue like this, I will not be able to be a communist party member. In the future, I will definitely stand firm and be a glorious party member. I will never surrender to the enemy in any environment and resolutely fight against the enemy." Li Tingxun said: "In the past, I only knew how to produce and earn wages, and it was okay if it was beneficial to myself, and I didn't care whether it was beneficial to the party or not. Now I realize that, in the future, even if my own father harms the interests of the party, I will resolutely fight against him." (To be continued)

### 中共唐山市委在四个支部进行整党典型试验的报告

    中共唐山市委在四个支部进行整党典型试验的报告
    编者按：中共唐山市委整党典型试验的经验可供各地参考。唐山市某厂等四个支部经过整党后，党员的觉悟显著提高，党在群众中的作用大为加强，支部面貌一新。多数党员都能根据党员标准认识自己的主要毛病，并经常用以检查自己的思想和工作。党在群众中的威信因而更加提高。群众反应：“整党好，整党使个个党员变了样。”由于这些成绩影响了其他支部，其他支部也纷纷要求早日整党。唐山市委整党典型试验的经验，说明了整党过程也是教育党员的过程。教育的内容必须和党员的思想相结合，开展批评和自我批评，不断地提高党员的思想觉悟水平。同时，在运动中，要十分注意发现、教育和培养积极分子，这是领导整党工作的重要方法之一。
   （一）典型的支部情况和整党 动员工作
    唐山市的整党典型试验，是由市委抽调干部十名，配合厂矿党委组成四个工作组，在市委组织部直接领导下，以某厂等四个支部为整党典型来进行的。四个支部共有党员一百十四名，内正式党员九十五名，候补党员十九名。解放前入党的八名，一九四九年五月至八月入党的十五名，一九四九年九月至一九五○年二月入党的六十五名，一九五○年三月以后入党的二十六名。家庭出身：工人十六名，雇农七名，贫农七十七名，中农八名，富农二名，地主一名，城市贫民二名，职员一名。本人成份：工人一百十一名，职员三名。
    整党开始，首先进行整党学习的动员：说明整党目的、要求和方法。大多数党员表示愿意学习，情绪饱满，有的支部自动订立学习公约：“不脱班
    （不误生产），不旷课，不迟到，服从领导，安心学习，团结互助”。有的党员很高兴地说：“早就应当进行整党学习，不然老是思想糊涂，进不了步。”“一年就应该进行一两次整党学习，进步才快哩！”但也有少数党员不愿学习，强调家庭困难，没有工夫。也有的企图泄私恨整别人，也有的等着挨整，也有的满不在乎。这些不正确的认识，在讨论中经过批评，一般得到了纠正。
    （二）学习关于党的性质的问题
    一、在讲课以前，一般党员都认为“共产党好，是给工人阶级谋利益的，共产党来了工人才得到解放，当了主人翁。”对于党是什么人的党，少数党员由于在党训班或职工学校学习过，能谈出共产党是工人阶级的政党，是在工人运动基础上产生的，知道“共产党是工人阶级的党，因为工人是先进阶级，最革命最有组织性”，但是不能够进一步说出道理来。大部分党员接受党的教育不多，有的根本不知道共产党是什么人的党；甚至有的认为“今后生产建设离不了工人，所以共产党叫工人阶级的党。”由于不少的党员是农民出身，现在仍是半农半工的家庭，还由于我党长期处在农村，领导农民进行了土地改革，因而认为“共产党是农民的党”。有的人说：“共产党从前在农村就是农民的党，现在到城市就是工人的党，到那里是那里的党。”“共产党给农民分土地，给工人增工资，救济失业，救济灾民。农民、工人、灾民都是穷人，反正是穷人的党不是富人的党。”
    二、学习党的性质，是以讲解为主、结合讨论进行的。在进行中我们摸索到如下经验：
    1、讲的内容和对学习的要求，必须根据党员的思想水平，从他们现实的思想觉悟基础出发，而引导着提高一步。学习党的性质，中心问题是使他们认识中国共产党是什么人的党。只有解决了这个问题，才能进一步解决中国共产党是工人阶级的先锋队的问题。
    唐山解放以后，在党的领导下，工人阶级在政治上做了国家的主人，生活上有了很大的改善，他们认识共产党好。因此，应从这一思想基础出发，说明工人阶级要彻底翻身，必须发展生产，使工业国有化，农业集体化，逐步达到共产主义社会，这是党的奋斗目标，也是工人阶级最大利益，最美好的前途。继而说明，中国共产党就是工人阶级利益的代表者，是工人阶级的党。这种联系工人实际生活的讲法，工人容易接受。
    从生产方式上的不同，讲明农民阶级和工人阶级的区别（当然在反对封建和要求民主上他们是相同的）。讲明我党领导农民进行土地改革，但并不是农民的党，因为将来农业集体化了，农民最后也变成了和工人没有多大区别的人，所以还是工人阶级的党。
    2、关于中国共产党是中国工人阶级先进部队的问题，一般地仅能认识到党员应该生产积极，起模范作用。因此进一步向党员标准方面加以引导，并把党员和非党工人群众作比较，会使他们容易接受，便于从思想上提高一步。但是抽象地讲要掌握马列主义，懂得社会发展规律，是不容易成功的，是要求过高的。
    3、在讲解时，每一次可解决一个问题，不要讲许多问题。因为大家文化水平比较低，讲多了单凭脑力记不了，过后易忘。讲法要浅显，不要多用生疏的名词。
    4、一个支部的人并不多，讲课时方式要活泼些，时间短些。可以采取讲一个问题讨论一个问题，或者边讲边问边解答的方法，以便于通过他们自己的思想解决问题。
    三、经过两三天的学习，从测验上看，百分之七、八十的人答得较好，一般地都从浅近的道理懂得了共产党是工人阶级的党，都能这样说：“过去工人阶级受压迫，就要起来革命，怎样革？分工厂行不行？不行，就得共产。共产没人领导也不行，就得组织司令部，司令部就是工人阶级中有觉悟的优秀分子组织起来的共产党。”
    关于中国共产党是中国工人阶级先锋队，大部分知道了党员要有远大眼光，掌握正确的政策。丁炳志说：“党是无名英雄，党在工会里出主意、想办法，办法想的好，大家就爱听，这就是当了先锋队啦！”张兴汉说：“过去我认为好好生产、当模范就行；现在知道了光会生产还不够做一个共产党员。”
    但是，有少数党员，由于上进心不强，家庭琐事影响学习，领导上对他们个别教育及展开互助抓得也不够紧，因此，他们的学习收获不大，还不能清楚地说明中国共产党为什么是中国工人阶级的党。
    （三）学习关于党的当前任务和
        最终目的的问题
    学完党的性质后，就学习中国共产党的当前任务和最终目的。少数党员在职工学校、党训班学习过，对共产主义社会有一般的概念，知道共产主义社会没有压迫没有剥削，取消私有制，生产力发展到最高度，“各尽所能，各取所需”。中国必须经过新民主主义社会的建设阶段，才能达到社会主义和共产主义。多数党员也知道有共产主义这回事，但是有不少糊涂的和错误的认识：有些人认为“共产主义是吃大锅饭，不分你的我的”，“你有啥我也有啥，吃的穿的都一样了，一切东西都平均了”；有的认为“想干啥就干啥，不愿作工就呆着”；有的认为“到处用机器，一个机器顶几百人，中国人这样多，都干啥去，这不是麻烦吗”，“共产主义净吃好的，五谷杂粮谁吃”！
    分析了党员的思想情况，我们认为这一课的学习，中心问题是要使大家对共产主义有个初步的认识，并清除糊涂观念。所以在讲解时，一般地说明社会主义社会和共产主义社会的特征，着重地讲清楚共产主义就是消灭生产资料的私有制，讲明共产主义社会丰富的财富，是因为有了高度发展的生产力，是劳动创造的，劳动是自觉的，劳动成为人民迫切的需要，因此，那时的人们不可能有偷懒的思想和行为。
    为了使他们较深刻而具体地认识社会主义社会，应以讲故事的方式尽可能介绍苏联的工人生活和生产情形。
    讲了共产主义——党的最终目的以后，大家认识到共产主义社会是美满幸福的，增长了向往心情。在这一思想情绪下，从中国现时的情况说明中国革命必须经过两个阶段：当前要努力建设新民主主义社会，要团结四个朋友，消灭三个敌人，抗美援朝，镇压反革命，发展生产，繁荣经济，使农业国变为工业国，才能过渡到社会主义社会，进一步过渡到共产主义社会。
    经过讲解和讨论，一般地都对党的最终目的有了一个轮廓的了解。知道了共产主义社会消灭私有制，没有阶级，没有剥削和压迫，生产使用机器，生产率大大提高了。对于共产主义的种种错误认识，也一般地做了批判和改正，如说：“过去我老想不通，你爱吃大米我爱吃白面，要求不一样，怎能吃大锅饭，现在知道过去的想法太可笑了。”“劳动是光荣的，财富是劳动创造的，大肚皮（地主）才不愿劳动哩！好吃懒做，到不了共产主义社会。”
    对于党的当前任务，大家知道得较多些，有的并表示决心说：“我们要努力干，多生产。”“党需要我们的时候，我们就放下工具拿起枪杆。”有一个党员（老工人）说：“我年纪老了，动员我儿子到朝鲜打美国鬼子去。”
    这一课虽有很大的收获，但是由于时间短、内容多、党员的接受能力差，仅能达到有个概括的不完整的了解。消灭体力和智力劳动的对立以及国家政权的消失问题，党员不易接受，如讲了有的党员还会产生糊涂的思想。此外，讲课人对苏联生产情况和人民生活情况的了解少，所以还不能以更多的具体而又生动的材料，说明社会主义的情况，抽象地说明问题，就不免使听的人难于领会。（四）学习终身为共产主义奋斗和
    党的利益高于一切的思想
    在学习了党的最终目的以后，进行了终身为共产主义事业奋斗和党的利益高于一切的教育。这两课的学习，首先结合着他们思想上、工作中存在的问题，进行扼要、明确的讲解。讨论时要联系实际，展开思想检查，并进行分析批判。在这一检查中，有少数人思想有顾虑，批评精神差；一般的是态度老实，揭露了许多问题。经过分析批评，一般的党员觉悟，都有提高，终身做个党员及克服自己缺点的决心也增长了。
    在学习终身为共产主义事业奋斗中，检查了他们的入党动机。从谈出来的材料看，几乎没有一人在入党动机上是完全纯正的。有少数人在入党前经过教育，对党有些认识，入党动机有为人民服务，为实现共产主义的成分，但为个人的仍占很大比重；多数党员是为了个人前途和切身利益入党的。有的是自从解放后“获得了切身利益，看着共产党好，拥护共产党的主张”而入党的；有的看到“全中国都成了共产党的天下了，参加共产党没歪道，一定有好处。”“参加党吃得开，说话也腰粗，不受人管，还可以管人。”“小工子有保障，不致失业，还可以提升；当工头、当干部多赚工资。”一个出身于农民家庭的党员是“为了不交租，土地改革时可以多分土地，村里可以另眼看待”而入党的。有的“看共产党对穷人不错，入了党即便没有多大好处，也不致有多大坏处。”也有的“因为和别人有私愤，怕报复，入了党，还可以借机泄私愤，整旁人。”有个别人没有入党的要求，而是被介绍人硬拉进党里来的，还有个别人是为了逃避土地改革，怕斗争，和隐瞒历史（反动党派及罪恶行为）问题，找护身符，假装积极而混入党内的。
    在学习党的利益高于一切中检查了个人和党的关系。少数较好党员，服从组织领导，并积极负责，执行党的决议，遵守党的纪律；但大多数党员组织观念差，不能把党的利益摆在个人利益之上，情绪忽高忽低，不经常地过组织生活，怕耽误自己的私事，在召集开会时，前门找后门溜，不愿缴纳党费，在参加党课学习上，有的认为“没文化，岁数大，误了家里活，也记不下，瞎子点灯白费蜡”。有的在党的工作上表现不积极，如说：“我为人民服务，谁为我服务？”“我给党做工作，家里活计谁给我做？”“做工作还挨群众骂，费力不讨好，合不上。”甚至有的产生退党思想。
    以上的思想一经揭发后，引起了大家的内心斗争，再经过分析、批判，辨清了是非，因而普遍地在思想上提高一步。他们懂得了一个共产党员不应妥协倒退，“革”半截“命”，应该为共产主义奋斗到底，个人利益应服从党的利益。认识了党的事业光荣、伟大，而且又很艰巨，只要有决心，一切困难是能够克服的，没有共产党不屈不挠的英勇斗争，就没有我们今天的胜利，也没有将来的共产主义社会。如党员郭恩贵说：“我看着共产党好，入了党，入党后又嫌开会太麻烦，耽误自己的事，就消极想退党，现在才认识我真不够做个党员，要都像我这样，中国革命早就失败了，今后一定下决心为共产主义奋斗到底。”范小山说：“过去我有变天思想，动摇不定，入了党又怕国民党来了掉脑袋，如要这样下去，就当不了共产党员，今后我一定站稳立场，作一个光荣的党员，任何环境下不投降敌人，坚决向敌人斗争。”李庭训说：“过去我就知道生产赚工资，自己有利就行了，那管对党有利没利。现在认识了，今后就是我亲爹损害了党的利益，我也坚决和他斗争。”（未完）
