    Yu Tian Woluogu Town Post Office Agency Deputy Director
    Su Jingxian Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty Handed Over to Court for Punishment

    Su Jingxian, Deputy Director of the Woluogu Town Post Office Agency in Yu Tian County, Hebei Province, has been handed over to the court for punishment due to embezzlement and dereliction of duty.

    Su Jingxian is a native of Woluogu Town, Yu Tian County. In 1949, when Su Jingxian was acting as the Deputy Director of the Woluogu Town Post Office Agency, he lived a corrupt life and was consistently lax and careless in his work, deceiving his superiors. After he got married in March of this year, he became even more irresponsible in his work, completely entrusting all the work of the agency to his fifteen-year-old younger brother. On July 5th this year, when the county post office director came to the agency to inspect the work, he discovered from the sales figures of fixed-amount money orders, stamps, and postage stamps that Su Jingxian had embezzled over 2.3 million yuan. Besides using over 200,000 yuan for his marriage, the rest was squandered by him. From October 1950 to July this year, Su Jingxian accumulated 117 double-registered letters that he had not sent out. Upon further investigation, 27 double-registered letters were found in Su Jingxian's home, totaling 144 letters. Among them were military mails, letters from banks, and various organizations. These letters included three money orders totaling over 67 million yuan, as well as over 30 pieces of luggage. The rest belonged to people from all walks of life. One of them was sent by the son of military dependent Li Qingde from the Korean front, and the letter contained a 250,000 yuan money order. Su Jingxian's crimes are very serious, and he has now been handed over to the People's Court for punishment. Liu Shuangjin

    玉田窝洛沽镇邮局代办所副主任
    苏景贤贪污渎职已交法院惩办
    河北省玉田县窝洛沽镇邮局代办所副主任苏景贤，贪污渎职，已经送交法院惩办。
    苏景贤，玉田县窝洛沽镇人。一九四九年，苏景贤代理窝洛沽镇邮局代办所副主任时，生活腐化，一贯工作松懈、粗枝大叶，欺骗上级。他从今年三月结婚后，对工作更不负责，把代办所一切工作完全交给他的一个十五岁的弟弟去作。今年七月五日，县邮局局长到这个代办所检查工作时，从定额汇票、印花、邮票等的经售数目中，查出苏景贤挪用了二百三十多万元，除结婚用了二十多万元外，其余都被他挥霍了。从一九五○年十月到今年七月，苏景贤积压了双挂号信一百十七件没有发出去，再追查后，从苏景贤家中又搜出双挂号信二十七件，前后共计一百四十四件。其中有军邮的、银行的和各机关团体的信。这些信件中，包括汇票三张，计六千七百多万元，还包括行李三十多件。其余都是各界人民的。其中有一件是四区军属李庆德的儿子从朝鲜前线寄来的，信中有二十五万元的汇票。苏犯景贤的罪恶是很大的，现在已被送交人民法院惩办。　刘双进
