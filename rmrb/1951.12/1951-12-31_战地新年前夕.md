    Battlefield New Year's Eve
        Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Tao
    On a biting cold morning, I visited the warriors of the Second Platoon of the "Iron Battalion" of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, guarding a certain area on the front line of Kaesong. During the Fifth Campaign, this platoon gloriously earned a special merit for destroying seven enemy tanks, killing or wounding more than 50 enemy soldiers, and capturing 59 enemy soldiers while pursuing and annihilating a part of the British 29th Brigade.
    The soldiers were repairing their fortifications, preparing to celebrate the upcoming New Year. The weather was freezing, and there were many stubborn rocks on the mountain. One swing of the pickaxe left a white mark, and the fallen rocks were no larger than copper coins. But the soldiers said, "There are no difficulties in front of the Volunteers. The rocks are hard, but our determination is even harder!" The company commander pointed to a worn-down pickaxe and said to me, "The soldiers have suggested sending it to Beijing for exhibition!" The soldiers gave each fortification a name: "Iron Position," "Victory Cave," "Hero Room," "Great Merit Trench," and wrote these names on wooden signs to hang on the positions. Recently, they also found pine branches and straw, and made them into five-pointed stars. They also wrote slogans such as "Welcome the New Year, strive for new honors and victories" and "Fight bravely until the United States is willing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue" to decorate their positions for the New Year. The logistics department sent the soldiers pork, cigarettes, and candy. The soldiers built small kitchens on the positions, installed stoves, and prepared to make dumplings for the New Year.
    The motherland's gifts and letters of appreciation were constantly sent to the front lines. The soldiers sincerely appreciated the love and support of the people of the motherland for the Volunteers. Wang Yongzhang, the former platoon leader of the Second Platoon (now the deputy company commander) and a hero with great merit, took out a red lacquered diary with golden peace doves on the cover. It was a gift from Liang Xiuying, a young member of the Communist Youth League from the Tianjin Municipal Democratic Women's Federation. She wrote on this beautifully bound diary: "I have kept this notebook for two years, and I am reluctant to use it easily. Now I give it to the most beloved Volunteer combat hero." Wang Yongzhang said, "We will never forget such deep affection."
    On the position, the soldiers were preparing to write New Year's greetings to the people of the motherland. Heroic soldier Hou Tianyou took out his certificate of merit and showed me the portraits of Chairman Mao, books, and notebooks given to him and his comrades by Qin Shuying, Qi Xiaohui, Xue Wanqin, and other students from the attached girls' middle school of Beijing Normal University. Hou Tianyou wanted me to write in his letter to them about a period of his ideological experience while guarding Beishan, Fahuadong, north of Lianchuan. He said: "At that time, the fighting was very fierce. I suddenly remembered a letter from my father in my pocket, which read: 'We have good days now, and we will never suffer again. This is what Chairman Mao gave us. You must protect your good life.' I thought: This is not just my father's words, this is the order of the people of the motherland, asking me to fight resolutely! At this time, the bullets ran out, and the enemy rushed up from three sides. An American devil grabbed my belt. I thought, 'You son of a bitch, you are dreaming!' I turned around and knocked him down, and then jumped off the cliff. I couldn't help but shout: 'Motherland, may you be glorious and great forever!' Later, when I woke up, I was in pain all over, and shells were still falling around me. The land of Korea was burning. At this time, I secretly swore to the motherland and the Korean people: 'As long as I have a breath, I will fight to the end!' I finally crawled back step by step."
    They also gave me a group photo of Hou Tianyou, Luo Juncheng, and others, asking me to send it to the students of the attached girls' middle school of Beijing Normal University to express their gratitude.
    The soldiers especially thanked the people of the motherland for supporting them with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy. They are carrying out a movement to cherish the motherland's materials. The soldiers promised to cherish every bullet and every grain of rice. They also put forward the slogan "Launch an economy competition with the people of the motherland."
    Every soldier hopes that the people of the motherland will know every victorious battle news of them, which is their most noble action to repay the people of the motherland. On the evening of November 19, two companies of enemy troops sneaked into their positions. The soldiers of this platoon quickly engaged in battle. They fought fiercely with two companies of enemy soldiers for four hours, repelling eight enemy assaults, killing or wounding more than 120 enemy soldiers, without suffering any casualties themselves, and capturing some weapons and ammunition. The soldiers asked the reporter to write this battle story in the newsletter and tell it to the people of the motherland.
    When I left this position, Wang Yongzhang, the hero with great merit, and the warriors urged me: Tell all this to the people of the motherland! We sincerely hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but if the United States still wants to delay the war, then what they will get will be more casualties and more miserable defeats. They finally said enthusiastically: Happy New Year to the people of the motherland, and wish the construction of the motherland to be increasingly prosperous!

    战地新年前夕
        新华社记者    张    涛
    在一个北风凛冽的早晨，我去访问守卫在开城前线某地的中国人民志愿军某部“钢铁营”第二排的勇士们。这个排在第五次战役追歼英军二十九旅一部时，曾因击毁战车七辆、毙伤敌军五十多人、俘掳敌军五十九人，光荣地立了特等功。
    战士们正在修理自己的工事，准备庆祝即将到来的新年。天寒地冻，山上有很多顽石，一镐下去一个白印，掉下来的石块没有铜元大。可是战士们说：“志愿军面前没有困难，石头硬，我们的决心比它还硬！”连长指着一个磨得短短的镐头对我说：“战士们提意见要把它送到北京去展览呢！”战士们给各个工事都起了名字，“钢铁阵地”、“胜利洞”、“英雄室”、“大功沟”，并把这些名字写到木牌上后挂在阵地上。最近，他们又找来了松枝和稻草，编成五角星，还写了“迎接新年，争取新的荣誉和胜利”、“英勇战斗，直到美国愿意和平解决朝鲜问题时为止”等标语，准备到新年时装饰他们的阵地。后勤部给战士们送来了猪肉、纸烟和糖果。战士们在阵地上盖了小厨房，按上锅灶，准备在过年时包饺子吃。
    祖国人民的慰劳品和慰问信不断地送到前线。战士们衷心感激祖国人民对志愿军的热爱和支援。原二排排长（现任该连副连长）大功功臣王永章拿出一个红漆皮的日记本，皮面上烫着金色的和平鸽。这是天津市民主妇女联合会一个叫梁秀英的青年团员送给他的。她在这个精装的日记本上写着：“这个本子我保存了两年，轻易舍不得使用，现在我把它送给最可爱的志愿军战斗英雄。”王永章说：“这样的深情厚意，我们永远也忘不了。”
    在阵地上，战士们正酝酿着给祖国人民写贺年信。英雄战士侯天佑拿出了自己的立功证，和北京师范大学附属女子中学秦淑英、齐小慧、薛宛琴等同学赠给他和他的战友的毛主席像、书籍和笔记本叫我看。侯天佑要我把他在守卫涟川以北法化洞北山时的一段思想经历写在给她们的信上。他说：“当时战斗正打得很激烈，我忽地想起装在怀里的父亲的一封来信，这信上写着：‘我们有了好日子，永不再受苦了。这是毛主席给的。你要好好保卫自己的好生活。’我想：这不只是父亲的话，这是祖国人民的命令，要我坚决地打！这时子弹打光了，敌人从三面冲了上来。一个美国鬼子抓住了我的皮带，我想：‘狗养的，你这是梦想！’我翻身打倒了他，接着纵身跳下了悬崖。我不由地喊出：‘祖国，让你永远光荣，永远伟大吧！’后来我醒过来时，混身疼痛，周围还在落炮弹，朝鲜的土地上正在燃烧着。这时，我暗暗向祖国、向朝鲜人民宣誓：‘只要有一口气，坚决战斗到底！’我终于一步步地爬了回来。”
    他们又把侯天佑、罗俊成等合照的一张照片交给我，叫我转寄给北京师范大学附属女子中学的同学，表示对她们的感谢。
    战士们特别感谢祖国人民以增产节约的实际行动来支援他们。他们正在开展爱护祖国物资的运动，战士们保证：做到珍爱一颗子弹，一粒米。他们并提出了“和祖国人民展开节约竞赛”的口号。
    每个战士都希望祖国人民知道他们每一个胜利的战斗消息，这是他们报答祖国人民的最崇高的行动。十一月十九日晚上，敌军两个连偷袭他们的阵地。这个排的战士们很快就投入了战斗。他们和两个连的敌人激战四小时，打退了敌人八次冲锋，毙伤敌人一百二十多名，而自己无一伤亡，并缴获武器弹药一部。战士们嘱托记者把这个战斗事迹写在通讯里，告诉给祖国人民。
    我离开这个阵地时，大功功臣王永章和勇士们叮咛我说：把这一切都告诉祖国人民吧！我们诚心希望和平解决朝鲜问题，但是假若美国还想拖延战争，那么，他们得到的将是更多的伤亡，更多的惨败。他们最后热情地说：祝祖国人民新年快乐，祝祖国建设日益繁荣！
