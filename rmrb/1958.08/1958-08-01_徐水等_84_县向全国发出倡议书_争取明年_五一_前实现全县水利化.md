XuShui and 84 Other Counties Issue Proposal to the Whole Country
    Strive to Achieve County-Wide Irrigation by "May 1st" Next Year

    (Our Newspaper) Report: At the Northern Region Farmland Irrigation Work Conference, eighty-four county-level units expressed their determination to work hard for a year and strive to basically achieve county-wide irrigation before the "May 1st" Labor Day next year. They also issued a proposal to all counties across the country to strive to achieve irrigation through another year of hard work. This proposal was adopted at the Northern Region Farmland Irrigation Work Conference, which closed on the 16th.

    The standards for an irrigated county proposed in the proposal are: to dam rivers for water storage and tap underground water sources, and to do a good job in soil and water conservation, so as to ensure a bumper harvest regardless of drought or flood; not to be冲 (chong) or submerged by a single rainfall of 300 millimeters; to ensure clear water flows out of the rivers and soil does not erode from the mountains; and to guarantee high yield even without rain for a year. Low-lying plains areas should strive to achieve river network systems.

    The eighty-four counties also proposed in the proposal that in future water conservancy construction, vigorous efforts should be made to build small hydropower stations and biogas stations. All reservoirs, canals, and rivers with a flow rate of 0.1 cubic meters and a head of 1 meter should establish power stations or hydropower stations, striving to ensure that rural water pumping, weeding, grain and feed processing, the main power for rural industry, and lighting are basically powered by electricity.

    The proposal pointed out that under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, with politics taking command and taking the lead, and on the basis of water conservancy projects built in the past few years, starting early and working hard for another year, the above-mentioned goal of county-wide irrigation can be achieved.

    These eighty-four county-level units are seven counties in Hebei Province, including XuShui and AnGuo; ten counties in Henan Province, including Jia County, JiYuan, and Yu County; five counties in Shandong Province, including LinYi and YunCheng; eleven counties in Shanxi Province, including JieYu, WuTai, and DaRen; five counties in Shaanxi Province, including XiXiang and ChangAn; two counties in Gansu Province, TianShui and WuShan; three counties in Qinghai Province, DaTong and HuangZhong; seventeen counties in Liaoning Province, Shenyang, GaiPing, AnDong, and TieLing; nine counties in Jilin Province, PanShi, YanJi, and BaiCheng; eight counties in Heilongjiang Province, KeShan and HaiLun; three counties/banners in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, NingCheng; and four districts in Beijing Municipality, TongZhou and DaXing.

    徐水等84县向全国发出倡议书
    争取明年“五一”前实现全县水利化
    本报讯　北方地区农田水利工作会议上，有八十四个县一级的单位表示决心，大干一年，要争取在明年“五一”节前基本实现全县水利化。它们还向全国各县发出了争取再大干一年实现水利化的倡议书。这个倡议书在16日闭幕的北方地区农田水利工作会议上通过了。
    倡议书提出的水利化县的标准是：拦河蓄水和挖出地下水源，并作好水土保持工作，作到旱涝保丰收，一次三百公厘雨不冲不淹、清水出川、土不下山；一年不雨也保丰产。低洼平原地区争取实现河网化。
    八十四个县还在倡议书中提出，要在今后兴修水利中，大力搞小型水力发电站和沼气站。凡具有零点一流量的水库、渠道与河流和一公尺落差的水头，都要建立发电站或水力站，争取作到农村抽水、锄草、粮食和饲料加工、农村工业主要动力和照明基本上都用电力。
    倡议书指出，在各级党委的正确领导下，政治挂帅，一马当先，在过去几年兴修水利工程的基础上，早日动手，再结结实实地大干一年，上述水利化县的目标是能够达到的。
    这八十四个县一级的单位是河北省徐水、安国等七县，河南省郏县、济源、禹县等十县，山东省临沂、郓城等五县，山西省解虞、五台、大仁等十一县，陕西省西乡、长安等五县，甘肃省天水、武山两县，青海省大通、湟中等三县，辽宁省沈阳、盖平、安东、铁岭等十七县，吉林省磐石、延吉、白城等九县，黑龙江省克山、海伦等八县，内蒙古自治区宁城等三个县、旗，和北京市的通州、大兴等四个区。
