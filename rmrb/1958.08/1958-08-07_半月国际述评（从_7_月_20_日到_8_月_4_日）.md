Bi-Weekly International Review
(From July 20th to August 4th)

The worldwide people's sharp struggle against the US-British aggression in the Middle East and in defense of peace has achieved preliminary and great victories. The US-British aggressors have fallen into an extremely isolated predicament. At this time, the talks held by the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev, greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of the world to win and defend peace. However, the US-British aggressive forces are still continuing to prepare to expand their aggression, and are stepping up new political conspiracies to cooperate with this military plan, attempting to paralyze and disintegrate the will of the people of all countries to persevere in the struggle to the end, and save them from complete military, political and moral failure. The people of all countries must make persistent efforts to crush this new military and political conspiracy of the US-British aggressive forces.

A Major Guarantee of Peace

At the important moment when the people of all countries are taking united action to stop US-British aggression in the Middle East, at the important moment when the national liberation movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the anti-imperialist struggle of the people all over the world are entering a new stage, the leaders of China and the Soviet Union held talks of great significance to opposing aggression and safeguarding peace. The communique of the talks advocated the immediate convening of a summit conference of major powers to discuss the Middle East situation, and expressed firm support for the just struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries, and firmly demanded the immediate withdrawal of US-British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. At the same time, the two countries expressed firm support for the national independence movements of the peoples of Asian, African and Latin American countries. The communique of the talks expressed the determination and confidence to completely extinguish the flames of imperialist aggression. This is the most powerful warning to imperialist aggressors. Strengthening the unity between China and the Soviet Union, strengthening the friendly alliance and mutual assistance between the two countries, and jointly striving for peace, independence and socialism will be a major guarantee for the people of all countries to strive for world peace and progress.

The results of the Sino-Soviet talks have been warmly supported by the socialist camp countries, the Arab people who are struggling, and the people of all countries striving for independence, freedom and peace around the world, and have caused great unease and panic among the imperialist reactionary forces.

China and the Soviet Union have always stood at the forefront of defending peace. Since the US-British imperialists launched armed aggression in the Middle East, China and the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries have stood together with peace-loving countries and people all over the world from the beginning, firmly supporting the Arab people's heroic struggle against aggression and threats of force. China and the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries welcomed the revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people, recognized the Republic of Iraq, demanded that the US-British aggressor troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, and opposed the US-British conspiracy to further armed aggression against the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. The people of the socialist camp countries with a population of over 900 million have launched a huge wave of surging to stop aggression and defend peace. It is precisely because of the great union of socialist forces, Arab nationalist forces, and world peace forces that the US-British imperialists' plan to expand aggression has been curbed, and the US-British aggressors have inevitably moved towards failure.

The Soviet Union proposed on July 19 the convening of a summit conference of major powers to discuss immediate measures to stop the military conflict that had already begun in the Middle East. The Soviet proposal has received widespread support from socialist camp countries, Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and world public opinion. The US-British governments played a series of tricks in order to cope with the pressure of public opinion. They initially expressed their willingness to hold a summit meeting of heads of government within the framework of the United Nations Security Council, and then used "procedures" and "preparatory work" as excuses, attempting to replace the immediate summit meeting with an ordinary meeting of the Security Council in order to delay and obstruct. When this trick was exposed by Khrushchev's third letter, the US-British governments expressed their willingness to hold a special meeting of the Security Council on August 12, while setting up reefs to discuss so-called "indirect aggression." This is an attempt to use the Security Council meeting to achieve the purpose of covering up aggression. The Soviet government, in view of the fact that the Security Council has proved unable to make decisions conducive to peace, has refused to hold such a meeting, and advocates holding an emergency session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the issue of US-British troop withdrawal. The Soviet Union's new proposal has once again received the support of world public opinion.

The Soviet Union's peace efforts are so appealing, and the US-British government's practice of delaying and sabotaging summit meetings and adhering to a policy of aggression has not only aroused greater anger from the people of all countries, but also cannot but deepen the differences within the imperialist camp. The fact that the recent North Atlantic Group meeting was discussing the issue of convening a summit meeting of heads of government with different plans and endless quarrels is proof.

Aggressors are not reconciled to failure

The original plan of the US-British joint aggression in the Middle East was for the US-British aggressor troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan respectively, and the United States also sent armed forces into Turkey, and then attacked the Republic of Iraq from Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, and directed their spearhead at the United Arab Republic, attempting to extinguish the Middle East national independence movement. However, this vicious plan of aggression was frustrated by the resolute resistance of the Arab people with the support of the socialist camp and world peace forces from the beginning. The Republic of Iraq concluded a joint defense agreement with the United Arab Republic, and the Soviet Union, China and other socialist countries successively issued warnings to the United States, Britain, and Turkey. World opinion strongly condemned the US-British aggression. Deep divisions also occurred within the imperialist camp. The US-British aggressors fell into an unprecedentedly isolated situation, and had to consider the serious consequences of expanding aggression, and had to "limit intervention actions" as the "New York Times" admitted.

Not only that, the situation of the US-British aggressor troops being "limited" to Lebanon and Jordan is also very embarrassing. As soon as the US troops invaded Lebanon, the Lebanese opposition protested, and even after Murphy directed the presidential election, they still demanded the withdrawal of US troops. This completely exposed the thorough lie of the United States' so-called dispatch of troops to help Lebanon prevent "indirect aggression." As for the re-emergence of the British occupation army, the Jordanian people who drove away Glubb are even more old enemies who meet with special hatred. The British army's direct participation in the Hussein dynasty's suppression of the people will only make them more dangerously trapped in the flames of the Jordanian people's anger. American columnist Lippmann had to admit: The US-British aggressors "have reached a dead end. Our dispatch of troops not only has no hope of solving the revolutionary situation that prompted us to dispatch troops, but the longer the troops are stationed, the more difficult it is to withdraw the troops without causing the disaster that was intended to be prevented when the troops were initially dispatched." Wanting to extinguish the flames of national revolution, the result is that they fall into the flames of revolution. This is the inevitable end of aggressors and reactionaries.

However, the US-British aggressors have not relaxed their preparations to expand aggression. The large-scale military deployments they began pointing towards Iraq and the UAR are still continuing. The US occupation army in Lebanon has increased to 14,000, and has occupied outposts and border posts bordering Syria. Britain is also constantly increasing its occupation forces in Jordan, and has also occupied the southern Jordanian seaport of Aqaba, attempting to control the Gulf of Aqaba. At the same time, the United States has concentrated the Nineteenth Composite Air Force Assault Force and the Twenty-Fourth Division's 11,000 paratroopers at the Adana base in Turkey, and Turkish troops are also gathering towards the Syrian and Iraqi borders; after British troops landed in Libya on the flank of the UAR's Egyptian region, they continued to increase their troops in Libya, Cyprus, and Malta; in Aden and the Persian Gulf region, British military deployments are also very frequent. "New York Times" military commentator Baldwin admitted: The "considerable" forces that the US and Britain have assembled are much larger than the forces needed to achieve "limited" goals.

To coordinate the US-British aggression in the Middle East, the United States also announced that its troops in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines were in a "state of combat readiness." The Lee Seung-man gang issued war cries. The Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is also strengthening its so-called "alert," holding so-called air raid exercises for atomic bomb protection, and conducting military provocations against the Chinese mainland.

The so-called Baghdad Pact Council meeting held in London also exposed the activities of the US-British aggressors planning to further expand aggression. This was a meeting of conspirators who opposed Baghdad without Baghdad's participation. Dulles shouted at the meeting that adventurous actions should be taken against so-called "indirect aggression" from Iraq and the UAR, to "stop" "Nasser's ambitions." In order to save this aggressive bloc which was disintegrating across the board, the United States did not hesitate to tear off its mask and guaranteed that it would sign military agreements with the remaining member states separately and assume the obligations stipulated in this treaty. In the communique and statement, the meeting participants openly endorsed the US-British aggression in Lebanon and Jordan, and also openly expressed their intention to further strengthen their "unified defense position" and prepare to expand the scope of aggression in the Near and Middle East.

All these facts show that although the US-British military plan to invade the Middle East has suffered setbacks and its situation is becoming more and more embarrassing, they still have not abandoned their arrogant attempt to expand aggression and launch war adventures in the Middle East.

Be Vigilant Against US Political Conspiracies

In order to realize its plan to expand aggression and save its complete military, political and moral bankruptcy, the United States is stepping up political conspiracy activities from all aspects.

In addition to deceiving public opinion and obstructing and sabotaging the convening of the summit meeting, the US-British governments are trying their best to whitewash the naked aggressor faces of the US and British countries and seek legal status for military aggression. The United States has directed the presidential election in Lebanon through Murphy. After the election, Dulles proposed to use so-called "political stability" as a prerequisite for the withdrawal of US troops. This rude interference in internal affairs is obviously intended to make Lebanon a springboard for US aggression in the Middle East. At the same time, Dulles has openly demanded that a "UN permanent force" replace the US-British occupation forces in Lebanon and Jordan, which is actually to enable the US-British occupation forces to put on the guise of UN forces, just as they did during the Korean War. This completely exposes the conspiracy purpose of the US and Britain not wanting to withdraw their troops and attempting to create conditions conducive to their expansion of aggression and launching new war adventures.

However, the US-British aggressors are very clear that this political conspiracy alone cannot stop the just struggle of the Arab people. Therefore, the United States is doing its best to play two-faced tricks, trying to transform itself and re-disguise itself as a "friend" of the Arab people. It is clear that the London meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council planned an aggression plan against Iraq, but it decided to recognize the Republic of Iraq; it is clear that Dulles fiercely attacked the United Arab Republic at this London meeting, shouting to "stop" "Nasser's ambitions," but Dulles shamelessly said after the meeting that the United States did not oppose Arab nationalism, and even boasted that the United States was one of the first countries to recognize the UAR; it is clear that the US and Britain are brandishing their bayonets, attempting to strangle Arab national independent countries through military aggression and threats of force, but they are stepping up planning and propaganda on the so-called "UN Middle East regional development plan," pretending that they care about the "economic development" of these countries. Revealing the fangs and still pretending to be grandma, this is the extremely despicable and hypocritical performance of the US government. Murphy has expanded his conspiracy activities to Iraq and the UAR. It is reported that Murphy attempted to revive the Baghdad Pact in Iraq, inducing Iraq to agree to continue to participate in this bankrupt treaty; and his visit to Cairo was also to complete a "most difficult" task to express "goodwill."

However, the Egyptian "Al-Misaa" pointed out: "We must never forget that he (Murphy) is conducting contact and negotiations with the support of the US military and the Sixth Fleet that threaten peace and security." "No matter how Murphy promotes the good intentions of the United States to us, as long as the US military is still stationed in the Middle East, we will not believe him." We must be vigilant and crush the political conspiracies of the United States so that the United States cannot use cunning diplomacy to save the complete bankruptcy of its gunboat policy in order to achieve goals that military aggression cannot achieve.

The Arab and other peoples' just struggle to resolutely demand that US-British troops get out of the Middle East, stop expanding aggression, and safeguard Middle East peace has thoroughly exposed the US imperialists' mask of being the "friend" of the Middle East people, and has once again proved that US imperialism is not terrible, but just a paper tiger.

Fires Erupt in the US "Backyard"

Just as the Arab people are bravely fighting against US-British aggression, the national independence movement is also rising higher in Latin America, which is known as the "backyard" of the United States. The people of Argentina, Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and other countries have effectively struck at the US imperialist subversion and intervention conspiracies. At the same time, the people of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and other countries have held mass rallies and demonstrations to protest against US-British aggression in the Middle East and demand that US-British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. This is, on the one hand, the Arab people's just struggle has inspired the national independence movement of the Latin American people; and the development of the Latin American people's national independence movement has also powerfully supported the struggle of the Arab people. At present, these are all particularly heavy blows to the US imperialist policies of aggression and war.

The struggles of the people of Argentina, Venezuela, and Haiti against the US subversion and intervention conspiracies prove that US imperialism is not only the deadly enemy of the Middle East people, but also of the Latin American people in their struggle for independence and freedom. Argentina established the Frondizi government, which implemented policies that meet the national interests and the democratic demands of the people, in the presidential election in February this year; the Venezuelan people also overthrew the Jimenez dictatorship, which was loyal to US oil monopoly capital, this month; and the Haitian people overthrew the provisional government, which attempted to pave the way for the restoration of the old dictator, in February last year, and elected a new president in September of the same year. However, US imperialism cannot allow the Latin American people to have the right to elect their own government, and openly carries out despicable interference. In the past month alone, the United States has planned and directed its agents, such as the reactionary group headed by Rear Admiral Rial, commander of the Buenos Aires Naval District in Argentina, the conspiracy group headed by Venezuelan Defense Minister Castro-Leon, and the reactionary group headed by former Haitian Army officer Baski, to launch military coups separately in an attempt to overthrow the current legitimate government. In Cuba, because the Cuban people have persisted in armed uprisings, making the Batista dictatorial government precarious, the United States does not hesitate to openly carry out armed intervention, announcing that it will send US armed forces to invade Cuba.

The United States' behind-the-scenes and open conspiracies of subversion and intervention have exposed all the shameful excuses and lies it is now using for aggression in the Middle East. Eisenhower and Dulles repeatedly say that the United States respects the independence and sovereignty of small countries, and that US aggression in the Middle East is to "eliminate indirect aggression" and "help Lebanon maintain independence." But now, not only the Arab people, but also the people of Argentina, Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and other countries have exposed these lies and excuses. Cuban rebel leader Castro protested against the US's act of "openly undermining Cuba's sovereignty," and Haitian President Duvalier also accused the US of fabricating coup conspiracies as an act of international banditry.

The people of Argentina, Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and other countries have defeated the US subversion and intervention conspiracies. This shows that the Latin American people's struggle for independence and freedom has become stronger, and the US colonial rule in Latin America has become increasingly unstable. It can be seen from this that the tragic fate of the US aggressors in the Middle East region is by no means accidental.

    半月国际述评
    （从7月20日到8月4日）
    全世界人民反对美英侵略中东、保卫和平的尖锐斗争，已经取得了初步的巨大胜利。美英侵略者已陷于极端孤立的困境中。在这个时候，中苏两国领导人毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志举行的会谈，大大鼓舞了全世界人民争取和保卫和平的斗争。但是，美英侵略势力仍在继续准备扩大侵略，并为配合这一军事计划加紧进行新的政治阴谋，企图麻痹和瓦解各国人民坚持斗争到底的意志，挽救它们在军事上、政治上和道义上的彻底失败。各国人民必须再接再厉，粉碎美英侵略势力这个新的军事、政治阴谋。
    和平的重大保证
    正当各国人民以团结一致的行动来制止美英侵略中东的重要时刻，正当亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动和全世界人民反帝国主义斗争进入新的阶段的时刻，中苏两国领导人举行了对反对侵略、维护和平具有伟大意义的会谈。会谈公报主张立即召开大国首脑会议，讨论中东局势，并表示坚决支持阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家人民的正义斗争，坚决要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。与此同时，两国表示坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动。会谈公报表示了彻底扑灭帝国主义侵略战火的决心和信心。这是对帝国主义侵略者的最有力警告。中苏两国加强团结，加强两国友好同盟互助关系，为和平、独立和社会主义而共同奋斗，将是各国人民争取世界和平和进步事业的重大保证。
    中苏会谈的结果，得到了社会主义阵营各国、正在斗争中的阿拉伯人民以及全世界争取独立自由和平的各国人民的热烈支持，而使帝国主义反动势力感到极大的不安和惊慌。
    中苏两国一直站在保卫和平的最前列。自从美英帝国主义在中东发动武装侵略以来，中苏两国和其他社会主义阵营国家一开始就同全世界爱好和平的国家和人民站在一起，坚决支持阿拉伯人民英勇反抗侵略和武力威胁的斗争。中苏两国和其他社会主义阵营国家欢迎伊拉克人民的革命胜利，承认伊拉克共和国，要求美英侵略军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，反对美英进一步武装侵略伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的阴谋。九亿多人口的社会主义阵营国家的人民，掀起了汹涌澎湃的制止侵略、保卫和平的巨大浪潮。正是由于社会主义力量同阿拉伯民族主义力量，以及全世界的和平力量的伟大联合，才遏止了美英帝国主义扩大侵略的计划，使美英侵略者不可避免地走向失败。
    苏联在7月19日提出了召开大国首脑会议，讨论立即采取措施，停止在中东已经开始的军事冲突的建议。苏联的建议得到了社会主义阵营国家、阿拉伯国家、亚非国家和世界公众舆论的广泛支持。美英政府为了应付舆论的压力，玩弄一系列的诡计。它们最初表示愿意在联合国安理会范围内举行政府首脑会议，然后又以“程序”和“准备工作”为借口，企图以安理会的普通会议来代替立即举行首脑会议，以便进行拖延和阻挠。当它们这个诡计被赫鲁晓夫第三次信揭穿后，美英政府表示愿意在8月12日举行安理会特别会议，同时布置暗礁，讨论所谓“间接侵略”。这就是企图利用安理会的会议来达到掩盖侵略的目的。苏联政府鉴于安理会已证明不能作出有助于和平的决定，已拒绝举行这样的会议，主张举行联大紧急会议讨论美英撤军问题。苏联的新建议再一次得到了世界公众舆论的支持。
    苏联的和平努力是那样吸引人心，而美英政府拖延和破坏首脑会议和坚持侵略政策的做法，不仅引起了各国人民的更大愤怒，而且不能不加深帝国主义阵营内部的分歧。最近北大西洋集团会议上在讨论召开政府首脑会议的问题时各有打算，争吵不休的事实，就是证明。
    侵略者还不甘心失败
    美英联合侵略中东的原定计划，是由美英侵略军分别侵入黎巴嫩和约旦，美国并派武装部队进入土耳其，然后从土耳其、黎巴嫩和约旦进攻伊拉克共和国，并把矛头指向阿拉伯联合共和国，妄图扑灭中东民族独立运动。但是，这一凶恶的侵略计划，一开始执行，就被阿拉伯人民在社会主义阵营和世界和平力量支持下的坚决反抗所挫败了。伊拉克共和国同阿拉伯联合共和国缔结了共同防御协定，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家先后对美、英、土发出了警告，世界舆论强烈谴责美英侵略行动，帝国主义阵营内部也发生了深刻的分歧。美英侵略者陷于空前孤立的境地，不得不考虑到扩大侵略的严重后果，不得不像“纽约时报”所承认的那样“对干涉行动加以限制”。
    不仅如此，美英侵略军“限制”在黎巴嫩和约旦的景况，也是十分狼狈的。美军刚一侵入黎巴嫩，黎巴嫩的反对派就提出抗议，并且一直到墨菲导演了总统选举后，仍要求美军撤退。这就完全揭穿了美国所谓派遣军队帮助黎巴嫩防止“间接侵略”的彻头彻尾的谎言。至于英国占领军的卷土重来，对于赶走了格拉布的约旦人民更是老仇人见面，分外痛恨。英军直接参加侯赛因王朝对人民的镇压，只有使它们更危险地陷在约旦人民愤怒的火焰中。美国专栏作家李普曼不得不承认：美英侵略者“走到了一条死胡同里。我们出兵不仅没有希望解决促使我们出兵的革命形势，而且军队驻扎得越久，也就越不容易把军队撤出而又不致引起当初出兵时想要防止的灾难。”想要扑灭民族革命的火焰，结果使自己掉到了革命的火焰中，这是侵略者和反动派的不可避免的下场。
    但是，美英侵略者并没有放松扩大侵略的准备。它们一开始就大规模进行的指向伊拉克和阿联的军事部署，仍在继续进行。美国在黎巴嫩的占领军已增加到了一万四千名，而且占领了同叙利亚接壤的前哨和边防岗位。英国也在约旦不断增加占领军，还侵占了约旦南部的海港亚喀巴，企图控制亚喀巴湾。与此同时，美国已把第十九混合空军进攻部队和第二十四师的一万一千名伞兵集结在土耳其的亚达那基地，土耳其军队也在向叙利亚、伊拉克边境集结；英国军队在阿联埃及地区的侧背利比亚登陆后，继续在利比亚、塞浦路斯、马耳他增兵；在亚丁、波斯湾地区，英国的军事调动也很频繁。“纽约时报”军事评论员鲍德温承认：美英已集结的“相当可观”的兵力，比达到“有限”目标所需要的兵力大得多。
    为了配合美英在中东的侵略行动，美国还宣布它在日本、南朝鲜和菲律宾的军队处于“战斗准备状态”。李承晚匪帮发出了战争叫嚣。台湾蒋介石集团也在加强所谓“戒备”，举行所谓原子弹防护的防空演习，并向中国大陆进行军事挑衅。
    在伦敦举行的所谓巴格达条约理事会的会议，也暴露了美英侵略者策划进一步扩大侵略的活动。这是一次没有巴格达参加而反对巴格达的阴谋家会议。杜勒斯在会上叫嚷要对所谓来自伊拉克和阿联的“间接侵略”采取冒险行动，“制止”“纳赛尔的野心”。为了挽救全面瓦解中的这个侵略集团，美国不惜撕下了假面具，保证将同残存的成员国分别缔结军事协定，承担这个条约所规定的义务。会议参加者在公报和声明中公然赞同美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，还公然表示要进一步加强“统一的防御地位”，准备扩大在中近东的侵略范围。
    这些事实都说明，美英侵略中东的军事计划虽然受到了挫折，处境越来越狼狈，但它们依然没有放弃在中东扩大侵略和发动战争冒险的狂妄企图。
    警惕美国的政治阴谋
    为了实现扩大侵略的计划，挽救军事上、政治上、道义上的彻底破产，美国正在加紧从各方面进行政治阴谋活动。
    美英政府除了蒙骗舆论，阻挠和破坏首脑会议的召开以外，竭力设法粉饰美英两国赤裸裸的侵略者面目，并谋求军事侵略的合法地位。美国已通过墨菲导演黎巴嫩的总统选举，选举后，杜勒斯又提出要以所谓“政治稳定”作为美军撤退的先决条件。这种粗暴干涉内政的行为，显然是想使黎巴嫩成为美国侵略中东的跳板。同时杜勒斯已公开要求以“联合国常设部队”来接替美英在黎巴嫩和约旦的占领军，实际上就是使美英占领军能够披上联合国部队的外衣，正如在侵朝战争时期所做的那样。这就完全暴露了美英不愿撤军并企图造成一种有利于他们扩大侵略和发动新的战争冒险的条件的阴谋目的。
    但是，美英侵略者看得很清楚，仅靠这一政治阴谋是不能阻挡阿拉伯人民的正义斗争的。于是，美国就竭力耍两面手法，企图摇身一变，重新伪装成为阿拉伯人民的“朋友”。明明巴格达条约理事会伦敦会议策划了针对伊拉克的侵略计划，但又决定承认伊拉克共和国；明明杜勒斯在这个伦敦会议上穷凶极恶地攻击阿拉伯联合共和国，叫嚷要“制止”“纳赛尔的野心”，但杜勒斯在会后又厚颜无耻地说什么美国并不反对阿拉伯民族主义，甚至还吹嘘美国是最早承认阿联的国家之一；明明美英正在晃亮了刺刀，企图以军事侵略和武力威胁来扼杀阿拉伯民族独立国家，它们却又加紧策划和宣传所谓“联合国的中东区域开发计划”，装成它们关心这些国家的“经济开发”。露出了狼牙，还要装外婆，这就是美国政府极端卑劣和伪善的表演。墨菲已把他的阴谋活动扩大到伊拉克和阿联。据报道，墨菲在伊拉克曾妄图给巴格达条约招魂，诱骗伊拉克同意继续参加这个破了产的条约；而他的访问开罗，也是为了完成一个表示“善意”的“最困难”任务。
    但是，埃及“晚报”指出：“我们绝不能忘记他（墨菲）是在威胁和平和安全的美军和第六舰队作后盾的情况下进行接触和谈判的”。“不管墨菲如何向我们宣传美国的善良用意，只要美军仍然驻在中东，我们是不会相信他的”。必须警惕和粉碎美国的政治阴谋，使美国不能用诡诈的外交来挽救炮舰政策的彻底破产，以达到军事侵略所不能达到的目的。
    阿拉伯和各国人民坚决要求美英军队滚出中东、制止扩大侵略、维护中东和平的正义斗争，已经彻底地揭穿了美帝国主义披着的中东人民的“朋友”的假面具，并又一次证明美帝国主义并不可怕，只是一只纸老虎。
    美国“后院”烽火四起
    正当阿拉伯人民英勇地进行反对美英侵略的斗争的时候，在被称为美国“后院”的拉丁美洲，民族独立运动也更加高涨起来。阿根廷、委内瑞拉、海地、古巴等国人民有力地打击了美帝国主义的颠复和干涉阴谋。同时，智利、阿根廷、乌拉圭、秘鲁等国人民纷纷举行群众大会和示威游行，抗议美英侵略中东，要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。这就是，一方面，阿拉伯人民的正义斗争鼓舞了拉丁美洲人民的民族独立运动；而拉丁美洲人民的民族独立运动的发展，也有力地支持了阿拉伯人民的斗争。这在目前，都是对于美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的特别沉重的打击。
    阿根廷、委内瑞拉、海地人民反对美国颠复和干涉阴谋的斗争，证明了美帝国主义不仅是中东人民，也是拉丁美洲人民争取独立自由斗争的死敌。阿根廷在今年2月总统选举时成立了执行符合民族利益和人民民主要求的政策的弗朗迪西政府；委内瑞拉人民也在今年今月推翻了忠于美国石油垄断资本的希门尼斯独裁政府；海地人民则在去年2月就推翻了企图为旧独裁者复辟铺平道路的临时政府，在同年9月选举了新的总统。但是，美帝国主义不能容许拉丁美洲人民有选举自己的政府的权利，公然进行卑鄙的干涉。仅在上月一个月内，美国就策划和指使它的代理人，如阿根廷布宜诺斯艾利斯海军军区司令里亚尔为首的反动集团，以委内瑞拉国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂为首的阴谋集团，以前海地陆军军官巴斯基为首的反动集团，分别发动军事政变，企图推翻现在的合法政府。在古巴，由于古巴人民坚持了武装起义，使巴蒂斯塔独裁政府岌岌可危，美国竟不惜打算公开进行武装干涉，宣布要派美国武装部队侵入古巴。
    美国这种幕后的、公开的颠复和干涉阴谋，揭穿了它现在侵略中东的一切可耻借口和谎言。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯口口声声说什么美国尊重小国的独立和主权，说什么美国侵略中东是为了“消除间接侵略”，“帮助黎巴嫩维护独立”。但现在不仅阿拉伯人民，还有阿根廷、委内瑞拉、海地和古巴等国人民，都揭穿了这些谎言和借口。古巴起义领袖卡斯特罗抗议美国“公开破坏古巴的主权”的行为，海地总统杜瓦利埃也指责美国制造政变阴谋是一种国际土匪行为。
    阿根廷、委内瑞拉、海地、古巴等国人民已经击败了美国颠复和干涉阴谋。这说明拉丁美洲人民争取独立自由的斗争更加强大了，美国在拉丁美洲的殖民统治已经越来越不稳固了。由此可见，美国侵略者在中东地区的可悲命运，绝不是偶然的。
