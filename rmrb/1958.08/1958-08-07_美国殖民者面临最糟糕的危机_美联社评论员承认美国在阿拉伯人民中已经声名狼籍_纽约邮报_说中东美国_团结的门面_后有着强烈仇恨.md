Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: The Associated Press broadcast an article on August 2nd by its commentator, Ryan, analyzing why the United States is becoming increasingly unpopular in the Middle East. In the article, Ryan began by admitting, "For some years, the United States has been steadily losing friends in the Arab East. It is currently still losing friends."

Ryan reached the above conclusion after conducting field visits to Middle Eastern countries. Ryan said, "Events of the past three months have caused Western prestige in the Arab East to plummet. In the eyes of many Arabs, this two-pronged intervention—Britain's intervention in Jordan and the United States' intervention in Lebanon—has turned back the clock and resurrected the two terrible monsters of imperialism and colonialism."

Ryan believes that "one of the reasons why the United States is facing the worst crisis today is its short-sightedness. Americans have failed to see, or at least failed to understand, the meaning of the rising tide of movements for independence and national liberation in lands that have long been under colonial rule."

"This nationalist fervor has also swept through the Arabs... (they) are indignant about the history of exploitation."

According to Ryan, there were originally some Arabs who wanted to be friends with the West, but since the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, "such an atmosphere has now largely disappeared." Ryan said that now, "the United States can only count as friends in the Arab East those who rely on the friendship of the United States for their survival," including Hussein of Jordan and Camille Chamoun of Lebanon.

As a spokesman for the monopoly capitalists, Ryan made no secret of the fact that "oil and strategic position are the two key issues on which any consideration of (the Middle East) as the birthplace of Western civilization is based." However, in the face of the facts where they have been repeatedly frustrated, he admitted that the United States and Britain can no longer rely on armed suppression to maintain their rule in the Middle East. Instead, he advocated plotting political conspiracies to divide the Arab nationalist movement, hoping this could enable US and British imperialism to "avoid disaster."

Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: New York News: "The New York Post" recently published an editorial criticizing the US government's Middle East policy.

The editorial, titled "Treaties and Facts," stated that Dulles had effectively brought the United States into the Baghdad Pact without the approval of the Senate. The editorial believes that he has involved the United States in an agreement that "may ultimately create disputes rather than prevent them."

The editorial said that Dulles has always suffered from "treaty mania" and lacks foresight. This time, Dulles seems to have guaranteed that "the 'rulers' of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan do not have to worry about domestic opposition. If a revolution occurs, the threatened regime only needs to notify Washington, and the US Marines will immediately arrive."

The editorial said that Dulles only believes that "revolutions can be overthrown," but he does not believe that "revolutions will also occur where people have legitimate reasons to overthrow their government." The editorial believes that Dulles's basic concept is immoral.

The editorial said, "What happened in Iraq is a clear warning: some of the governments we rely on are governments that their people may not support. We have built such a facade of unity, behind which the unease and hatred may be intense, justified, and explosive. Shall we intervene simply because this situation threatens this facade?"

    美国殖民者面临最糟糕的危机
    美联社评论员承认美国在阿拉伯人民中已经声名狼籍
    “纽约邮报”说中东美国“团结的门面”后有着强烈仇恨
    新华社5日讯　美联社2日广播了它的评论员瑞安分析美国在中东为什么愈来愈声名狼籍的文章。在这篇文章里瑞安一开头就承认：“若干年来，美国在阿拉伯东方一直在不断丧失朋友。它目前还在丧失朋友。”
    瑞安是在中东各国作了实地访问以后得出上述结论的。瑞安说：“过去三个月的事件使得西方在阿拉伯东方的威信一落千丈。在许多阿拉伯人看来，这次双管齐下的干涉——英国在约旦的干涉和美国在黎巴嫩的干涉——倒拨了时钟，并且已经使帝国主义和殖民主义这两个可怕的怪物复活。”
    瑞安认为：“美国今天所以碰到最糟糕的危机，原因之一就是它一向目光短浅。美国人没有能看到，至少是没有能理解，战后在长期以来受到殖民统治的土地上风起云涌的争取独立和民族解放的运动的含义。”
    “这种民族主义狂热也席卷了阿拉伯人……（他们）对于剥削的历史都感到愤慨。”
    据瑞安说，本来还有一些阿拉伯人想同西方做朋友，但是自从美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦后，“这样一种气氛现在大部分已经消失了”。瑞安说，现在，“美国在阿拉伯东方世界中只能把那些把自己的生存依靠于美国的友谊的人引为朋友”，其中包括：约旦的侯赛因和黎巴嫩的夏蒙。
    作为垄断资本家的代言人的瑞安毫不讳言，“石油和战略地位是对（中东）这个作为西方文明发源地的地区进行任何考虑时所根据的两个关键问题”。不过，在碰得头破血流的事实面前，他承认美国和英国不能再靠武力镇压来维持他们在中东的统治，而主张策划政治阴谋去分化阿拉伯民族主义运动，希望这样可以使美英帝国主义“避免灾难”。
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”最近发表一篇社论，抨击美国政府的中东政策。
    这篇以“条约和事实”为题的社论说，杜勒斯未经参议院的批准实际上已使美国参加了巴格达条约。社论认为，他使美国参加了一项“最后可能只会制造纠纷而不能防止纠纷的”协定。
    社论说，杜勒斯一向患“条约狂”而没有远见，这次杜勒斯看来已经保证“土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦‘在朝者’可以不必担心国内的反对派。如果发生了革命，受到威胁的政权只需通知华盛顿，美国海军陆战队就会马上开到。”
    社论说，杜勒斯只认为“可以把革命推翻”，他却不认为“革命也会在人民有正当理由推翻他们的政府的地方发生”。社论认为，杜勒斯的基本概念是不道德的。
    社论说，“伊拉克发生的事情就是一个清楚的警告：我们所依靠的一些政府是它们的人民可能不支持的政府，我们已经建立起这样一个团结的门面，在它后面的不安和仇恨情绪可能是强烈的、正当的和富有爆炸性的。难道我们由于这种情况威胁到这个门面就加以干涉吗？”
