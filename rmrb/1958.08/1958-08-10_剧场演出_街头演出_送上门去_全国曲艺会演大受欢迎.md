The First National Folk Art Performance Convention has become a major event in the cultural life of the people of Beijing. From its opening on August 1st to the 9th, nearly 80,000 spectators have watched the rich and colorful performances from 27 delegations from all over the country. More than half of the audience were workers, peasants, and soldiers. The ability to attract so many viewers in just eight or nine days demonstrates the role of folk art as a literary and artistic vanguard.

In recent days, folk art delegations from various regions have adopted methods such as theater performances, street performances, touring performances, and door-to-door delivery to enthusiastically serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. As of the 9th, nearly forty street performances had been held in Beijing, with performers braving the summer heat to come to the streets and alleys. After the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev was published, many folk art delegations immediately compiled more than twenty new pieces in support of the communiqué, and went to the streets on the afternoon of the 5th to promote it. During the performances, the audience shouted slogans such as "Defend world peace" and "Oppose imperialist aggression" along with the performers. The welcome received by theater performances was also unprecedented. Not only were the theaters packed, but there were often many people crowded at the theater door waiting to buy returned tickets. Some workers traveled from Fengtai to see the performances. Starting on the 8th, delegations from various regions also went to twenty-two units such as factories, government offices, military units, and schools to perform. Beijing Television broadcast the performances of the convention.

Premier Zhou Enlai watched the performance on the evening of the 4th, which greatly encouraged all the delegates participating in the convention. The delegates posted big-character posters, expressing their determination to "spread their wings and fly into the sky, singing for workers, peasants, and soldiers" and to "plant the red flag all over the world" so as not to fail the Party's expectations.

The performances of folk art delegations from various regions are a good opportunity for Beijing's literary and art groups to observe and learn. Actors from the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Broadcasting Orchestra, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, and the Central National Song and Dance Troupe are seriously learning folk singing methods from folk art performers from various regions, and are preparing to hold a report-back performance soon. Many famous writers and artists have also come to observe. In recent days, many Beijing newspapers and periodicals have published review articles.

New pieces created by representatives from various regions in support of the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev have already appeared in Beijing's "Street Poetry Windows," and the Writers Publishing House has selected excellent works from them for publication in the "Folk Art Album."

    剧场演出　街头演出　送上门去
    全国曲艺会演大受欢迎
    本报讯　第一届全国曲艺会演大会成为北京人民文化生活中的一件大事情。从8月1日开幕到9日为止，已经有近八万多观众观看了来自祖国各地的二十七个代表团丰富多彩的演出，观众中半数以上是工农兵。在短短的八、九天里，就能吸引这样多的观众，正表现了曲艺这一文艺尖兵的作用。
    这些天来，各地曲艺代表团采取了剧场演出、街头演出、巡回演出、送上门去等方式，热情为广大工农兵观众服务。到9日为止，已经在北京街头演出了近四十场，演员们冒着盛暑来到了大街小巷。当毛泽东主席和赫鲁晓夫同志会谈公报见报以后，许多曲艺代表团马上动手编出了二十多个拥护会谈公报的新段子，5日下午就来到街头宣传。演唱的时候，观众同演员一起高呼“保卫世界和平”、“反对帝国主义侵略”等口号。剧场演出所受到的欢迎也是空前的。不仅场场满座，而且经常有很多人拥在剧院门口等着买退票。有些工人从丰台赶来看演出。从8日开始，各地代表团还到工厂、机关、部队、学校等二十二个单位登门演唱。北京电视台专门播送了会演的演出。
    周恩来总理在4日晚上观看了演出，给参加这次会演的全体代表以极大鼓舞。代表们贴出大字报，表示要“展翅飞天空，歌唱工农兵”，要“把红旗插遍五湖四海”，以不负党的期望。
    各地曲艺代表团的演出是北京各文艺团体观摩学习的好机会。中央乐团、中央实验歌剧院、中央广播乐团、中央歌舞团、中央民族歌舞团的演员们正认真向各地曲艺演员学习民间唱法，并且准备在最近举行一次汇报演出。许多著名作家、艺术家也亲临观摩。这几天来，北京许多报刊发表了评介文章。
