Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 12th—Lebanese opposition leader Salam issued a lengthy statement late on the 11th, criticizing the five-point plan on the Middle East situation proposed by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld at the UN General Assembly on the 8th. He said, "We cannot agree with Hammarskjöld's plan to turn Lebanon into an 'international trusteeship'." He said that Lebanon's independence should stem from the unity of its people.

Salam strongly denounced Hammarskjöld's plan for disregarding Lebanese independence and interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. He said, "It is a very dangerous precedent for the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of a member state to such an extent."

Salam, in this statement issued on the eve of the UN General Assembly emergency meeting to discuss the Middle East situation, said that if the Chamoun government accepts any General Assembly resolution that does not represent the wishes of the Lebanese people, the country's fighting will continue. He opposed allowing Chamoun's pro-Western Foreign Minister Malik to join the Lebanese delegation attending the UN General Assembly emergency meeting.

Regarding the withdrawal of the invading American troops from Lebanon, Salam said that US President’s "special envoy" Murphy had guaranteed that once a new president was elected and the Chamoun government stepped down, US troops would also withdraw. "But ten days have passed since General Chehab was elected as the new president, and none of these guarantees have been fulfilled."

　　萨拉姆斥哈马舍尔德计划
　　反对托管黎巴嫩的阴谋
    新华社12日讯贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩反对党领袖萨拉姆在11日深夜发表长篇声明，抨击联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德8日在联合国大会上提出的关于中东局势的五点计划。他说，我们不能同意哈马舍尔德提出的要把黎巴嫩变成“国际托管地”的计划。他说，黎巴嫩的独立应当从它的人民的团结产生。
    萨拉姆强烈指责哈马舍尔德的计划无视黎巴嫩的独立和干涉黎巴嫩内政。他说，“联合国对一个成员国的内政竟然干涉到这种程度，这是一个十分危险的先例。”
    萨拉姆在讨论中东局势的联合国大会紧急会议召开前夕发表的这项声明说，如果夏蒙政府接受不代表黎巴嫩人民愿望的任何大会决议，这个国家的战斗就要继续下去。他反对让夏蒙的亲西方外长马利克参加黎巴嫩出席联合国大会紧急会议的代表团。
    萨拉姆在谈到撤退侵黎美军的问题时说，美国总统“特使”墨菲曾经保证等新总统一选出，夏蒙政府就下台，而美军也将撤退。“但是自从谢哈布将军当选为新总统后已经过了十天，而这些保证一个也没有实现。”
