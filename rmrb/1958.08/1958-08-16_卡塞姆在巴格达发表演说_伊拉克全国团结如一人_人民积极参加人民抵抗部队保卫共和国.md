Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 15th: Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem delivered a speech in Baghdad on the evening of the 14th, marking one month since the Iraqi revolution. He pointed out that the success of the July 14th Revolution was prepared by the Iraqi people's long-term struggle for liberation, especially the uprisings of 1920, 1936, 1941, 1948, 1952, and 1956.

He said that the existence of the Iraqi Republic has become a reality today. The Republic has the full support of the Iraqi people. He pointed out that the Iraqi army and the people are united. The Iraqi people, both Arabs and Kurds, are like one person. They vigilantly defend the Republic.

He said that the Iraqi Republic is a peace-loving country. It desires to live in peace with all countries in the world. Today's Iraq is no longer the Iraq of yesterday, which was a source of conspiracies against Arab countries and against world peace.

Kassem criticized the tyranny and corruption of the old regime. He said that some past leaders who listened to foreign and evil forces and committed crimes have been punished by the people's anger and hatred, and others will also be punished.

Kassem said that our revolution is a great victory for the Arab people's cause. It makes free people rejoice and gives oppressors a major blow. This revolution has added strength to the forces of freedom, who are working for the welfare of the people, the unity of the country, and universal peace.

Kassem finally called on the Iraqi people to be vigilant, to prevent divisions in their ranks, and to work more closely together to benefit the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 14th: This agency's reporter, Yan Biao, reports: An ordinary Iraqi tailor, Rahim Fares, said to me on the 13th: "We will not give the enemy an inch of land. Without freedom, there is no Iraq."

This sentence expresses the Iraqi people's greatest determination to defend the Republic and deal with imperialist aggression. This determination is currently concentrated in their active enrollment in the People's Resistance Forces. This enrollment work began on August 9th. On the afternoon of the 13th, I visited the Karada registration station in the eastern district of the city, not far from the Baghdad Hotel where we were staying. A group of citizens waiting to register patiently lined up, reading the list on the wall in front of the building. In the registration room, people and officials in charge of registration warmly received me. Just registered in front of the table was a driver named Wuziz Ahmed Fasil. He simply and clearly told me, "I am registering to protect my country and my children." Behind him was a carpenter named Helir Muhammad. When I asked him about his views on the revolution, he replied, "I am twenty-seven years old this year. But I feel like my life has just begun." Muhammad also expressed extreme indignation at the US-British armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan.

According to the officials in charge of registration, nearly three thousand people have registered at the Karada registration station, including fifty women.

The enthusiastic and resolute emotions of women participating in the movement to defend the Republic are moving. One day, a girl who works at the Central Bank of Iraq told me that she and other female activists had collected 4,246 signatures in two days for a petition against US-British intervention in Lebanon and Jordan. She said she was surprised to find that there were twenty-five girls in the delegation from her hometown of Najaf. Najaf is famous for its conservative social life. This delegation came here to express loyalty to the new government.

Every day, new signs can be seen in Baghdad indicating that the Iraqi people and army are supporting the Republic and are prepared to defend it by all means. Until recently, delegations of people from all over the country have continued to arrive in Baghdad to pay tribute to the new government. A lieutenant colonel showed me a list of residents of the city of Karbala (located southwest of Baghdad), with nearly a thousand fingerprints on it. These residents of Karbala pressed their fingerprints to express their loyalty to the new government.

Ordinary Iraqi soldiers also expressed their firm and optimistic emotions about defending the Republic. A soldier guarding in front of our hotel showed us the submachine gun he was carrying. He said, "This is the weapon of the imperialist elements. If they dare to invade our country, this weapon will be used to strike them."

　　卡塞姆在巴格达发表演说
　　伊拉克全国团结如一人
　　人民积极参加人民抵抗部队保卫共和国
    新华社巴格达15日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆14日晚上就伊拉克革命发生一个月在巴格达发表了演说。他指出，7月14日革命的成功是经过伊拉克人民争取解放的长期斗争所准备的，其中特别是1920年、1936年、1941年、1948年、1952年和1956年的起义。
    他说，今天伊拉克共和国的存在已经成为现实。共和国得到了伊拉克人民的全力支持。他指出，伊拉克的军队和人民是团结一致的。伊拉克人民不论是阿拉伯人和库尔德人都像一个人一样。他们警惕地捍卫着共和国。
    他说，伊拉克共和国是一个爱好和平的国家。它渴望同世界上所有的国家和平相处。今天的伊拉克已不再是昨天那个作为反对阿拉伯国家和反对世界和平的阴谋策源地的伊拉克了。
    卡塞姆抨击了旧政权的暴虐和腐败。他说，听命于外国和邪恶势力而为非作恶的过去的一些领导人已经受到了人民的愤怒和痛恨的惩罚，另外一些人也将受到惩罚。
    卡塞姆说，我们的革命是阿拉伯人民事业的伟大胜利。它使自由的人民兴高采烈，而给予压迫者重大打击。这次革命给爱好自由的力量增加了力量，它们正在为人民的福利、国家的统一和普遍和平而劳动着。
    卡塞姆最后号召伊拉克人民提高警惕，防止自己队伍的分裂和更加同心协力地多造福祖国而劳动。
    新华社巴格达14日电　本社记者言彪报道：一位伊拉克普通裁缝拉希姆·法尔斯13日对我说：“我们不会给敌人一寸土地，没有自由，就没有伊拉克。”
    这句话表达了伊拉克人民保卫共和国和对付帝国主义侵略的最大的决心。这种决心目前集中地表现在他们积极报名参加人民抵抗部队的行动上。这项报名工作是从8月9日开始的。13日下午，我访问了离我们所住的巴格达饭店不远的城东区卡拉德登记站。一群等待报名的市民耐心地排着队，读着大楼前面墙上的名单。在登记室里，人们和负责报名工作的官员热情地接待了我。在桌子前面刚刚登记完的是一位司机，名字叫伍齐兹·艾哈迈德·法西尔。他简单明确地对我说，“我报名是为了保护我的国家和我的孩子”。在他后面的是一位木匠，他的名字叫赫利尔·穆罕默德。我问起他对这次的革命的看法，他回答说，“我今年二十七岁。可是我觉得我的生命刚刚开始。”穆罕默德还对美英武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦表示极为愤慨。
    据负责报名工作的官员说，在卡拉德登记站已经有将近三千人报了名，其中包括五十位妇女。
    妇女们参加保卫共和国运动的热烈和坚决情绪是令人感动的。一天，一位在伊拉克中央银行当职员的姑娘对我说，她和其他妇女积极分子在两天内为反对美英干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的呼吁书征集了四千二百四十六个人的签名。她说，她吃惊地发现，她的故乡纳加夫的人民代表团中有二十五个姑娘。纳加夫是以社会生活保守而著名的。这个代表团到这里来表示忠于新政府。
    在巴格达每天都可以看到新的迹象，表明伊拉克人民和军队支持共和国，并且准备用一切手段来保卫它。直到最近，全国各地的人民代表团还继续不断地来到巴格达，向新政府致敬。一位中校给我看了一份卡巴拉城（位于巴格达西南）的居民的名单，上面有将近一千个指印。卡巴拉城的这些居民捺下他们的指印，表示忠于新政府。
    伊拉克的普通士兵也表达了他们保卫共和国的坚定和乐观情绪。一位守卫在我们饭店前面的士兵给我们看了他所携带的手提机关枪。他说，“这是帝国主义分子的武器。如果他们胆敢侵略我们国家的话，这个武器就将用来打击他们。
