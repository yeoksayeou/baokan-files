Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 18th: "Pravda" published a commentary on the "Regional Economic Development Plan" for Arab countries proposed by U.S. President Eisenhower in his speech at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly on August 13th.

　　The commentary stated that the experience of oil monopoly capital in conducting "civilizing activities" in this region of the world for nearly half a century has caused people to doubt the true motives of the "philanthropists" from across the ocean. It is primarily noteworthy that American officials often emphasize one point in their discussions: to implement the "aid" plan, it is first necessary to establish a United Nations "specialized agency" with the broadest powers to interfere in the internal affairs of the Arab East. The proposition for this regional economic institution comes precisely from those who support American interventionists in the Arab East.

　　"Pravda" pointed out that the "new plan" put forward by the U.S. President was secretly formulated by the Rockefeller Group long before it was announced on the United Nations platform. The newspaper continued that international trusts, rampant in underdeveloped countries, need the government to provide "guarantees" against the rising national liberation movements that threaten their rule. The article further pointed out that the U.S. government, subservient to Rockefeller, initially attempted to provide such "guarantees" in the form of armed aggression. Later, after this adventurous action suffered a complete failure, the U.S. ruling clique attempted to provide this "guarantee" through "United Nations specialized agencies" and "regional development" plans.

　　The newspaper emphasized that the essence of this plan for "regional aid" to Arab countries, which is being greatly touted, is to permanently fix the rule of predatory oil monopoly capital in the region.

　　"Pravda" concluded by writing that the people of the Arab countries, who yearn for a new life, resolutely oppose the "concern" of the "philanthropists" from across the ocean, no matter what "regional" banner this "concern" waves.

　　艾森豪威尔装扮“慈善家”
　  是想让洛克菲勒掠夺石油
　　——“真理报”评美国“区域性经济发展计划”
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：“真理报”就美国总统艾森豪威尔在8月13日联合国大会紧急会议上发言时所提出的阿拉伯国家“区域性经济发展计划”发表评论。
    评论说，石油垄断资本将近半世纪来在世界这一地区进行“文明活动”的经验使人对大洋彼岸的“慈善家”的真正动机发生了怀疑。首先值得注意的是，在美国官方人士的谈话中常常强调一点：要实现“援助”的计划必须先从建立联合国“专门机构”开始，让这个专门机构有最广泛的权力来干涉阿拉伯东方人民的内政，而这一个经济的区域性机构的主张正是来自那些为在阿拉伯东方的美国干涉者撑腰的人。
      “真理报”指出，美国总统提出的“新计划”是洛克菲勒集团早在联合国讲台上公布以前就偷偷拟定好了的。报纸继续说，在不发达国家中横行无忌的国际托辣斯需要政府提供“保证”来反对威胁他们统治的、日益高涨的民族解放运动。文章中接着指出，对洛克菲勒俯首听命的美国政府，起初企图以武装侵略的形式提供这种“保证”。后来，这种冒险行动遭到彻底失败以后，美国统治集团又企图用“联合国专门机构”和“区域性发展”的计划来给予这种“保证”。
    报纸强调指出，要把掠夺性的石油垄断资本在这一地区的统治永远固定下来，这就是大肆吹嘘的、对阿拉伯国家进行“区域性援助”的这个计划的实质。
    “真理报”最后写道，向往新生活的阿拉伯国家人民坚决反对大洋彼岸的“慈善家”的“关怀”，不管这种“关怀”打着什么样“区域性”的旗帜。
