[Early June, I took a trip to the Northeast. In a month, the new atmosphere and new people I saw were countless. After returning to Beijing, I took time to record them one by one, deeply regretting that my observation was not thorough enough and my writing skills were insufficient to live up to such a brilliant and boiling reality. August 1st.]

A Trip to Nanguan, Changchun

On page 3 of the July 5th "Changchun Daily," was published Comrade Huang Guangsheng's "A Trip to Nanguan," with five poems, the fifth of which is titled "Copper Sulfate Chemical Factory." At first glance, you might think: at least this is a building of several thousand cubic meters, with a group of technicians and hundreds of workers. But please read the original poem:

	White wooden boards, build a shed,
	A chimney stands in the middle.
	Pick up bricks to build a furnace,
	And you can produce copper sulfate.

	Copper sulfate, bright blue,
	Like gems sparkling.
	Can be used as an agricultural insecticide,
	And can also treat people's eyes.

	If you ask where the raw materials come from?
	Copper filings in the soil are washed with water.

This poem is entirely factual, with not a word of exaggeration. I visited this chemical factory. Such factories, in the Nanguan District of Changchun City, are not two or three, but hundreds. This is the people-run industry in the Great Leap Forward. As the preface to "A Trip to Nanguan" says: "The atmosphere of starting from scratch and blooming everywhere is developing vigorously in every corner of the motherland. This is just one example."

The day I arrived in Changchun, Changchun City was truly filled with joy and vigor. What I saw and heard was all inspiring. Look: teams of red flags, with drums and gongs, paying tribute to "July 1st," turned out to be more than two thousand employee representatives from the city's industry, construction, commerce, science, culture, and medical services reporting to the Party that they had submitted a total of 610,000 rationalization proposals in ten days, exceeding the city's trade union's call on June 19th by 110,000. Look: the various universities and colleges in Changchun City have established and are preparing to establish more than 160 factories. Northeast Normal University built more than 100 large and small factories and workshops in just ten days, producing more than 300 kinds and more than 1,000 pieces of products. Look: In 1957, Changchun City's industry and handicrafts exceeded the original production level of the First Five-Year Plan by 40.15%, an increase of 80.85% compared with 1952, an average annual increase of 13.5%, while the original plan was 6%. Look: Jilin Province's total industrial output value in 1957 increased by 115.7% compared with 1952, and the proportion of total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province has increased from 43.9% in 1952 to 63.4%. Listen, how ambitious was Governor Li Youwen's report at the First Session of the Second People's Congress of Jilin Province! During the Second Five-Year Plan period, Jilin will realize water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification. Listen, Jilin Province has newly built and renovated more than 158,000 farmland irrigation projects, which can irrigate a total of 660,000 hectares of farmland, an increase of five times compared with the original plan. Look, the people of Changchun City are learning from the example of the people of the capital in building the Ming Tombs Reservoir, preparing to build a large reservoir through voluntary labor, which is the Xinlicheng Reservoir, as large as the Ming Tombs Reservoir. After its completion, it can basically meet the city's industrial and domestic water needs during the Second Five-Year Plan period!

Also, look, He Shucheng, a technician from the Changchun City Gas Company, under the leadership and support of the Party and with the help of other technicians, dared to think and dare to do, and after more than 240 failures, finally successfully invented a new method of "extracting germanium from coal ash," and has extracted 200 grams of germanium, which has eloquently proved that it has opened up a new way for China's germanium extraction production. This invention, taking treasure from waste, has shocked the technical community!

The miracles in the Great Leap Forward are endless. Now I only intend to talk about one of the many miracles that seems to be the most ordinary but has great significance. This is the people-run industry in the Nanguan District of Changchun City.

Now let's go back and look at that "Copper Sulfate Chemical Factory." The wooden board shed is only about two zhang long and one zhang wide, ventilated on all sides, without doors and windows; the so-called "furnace" is just a brick-built coal stove, the size of which is similar to the four-eye stove popular in my hometown (the Jiahu area), but there are only two eyes. The raw material is furnace ash and garbage (containing copper filings) from the automobile factory. Use a shovel to put the raw material into the first eye of the "furnace," take it out after an hour and put it into the second eye, and take it out again after another hour and put it into a large vat, which contains water and sulfuric acid, and stir until the water is bright blue, then let it precipitate. The first half of the process ends here. In these processes, a total of three (or four) workers are used. An old man is the stoker, and he controls the heat in the furnace and the heating time of the raw materials. An old woman is in charge of adding materials and also in charge of stirring. A teenage girl puts the heated raw materials into a large vat for processing, and she is the only one wearing a dirty old work suit. This is a long vest style, as if it is made of acid-resistant material such as paint cloth. If we call this wooden board shed a workshop, then the equipment in this workshop is only one furnace and two large vats, and there are only three workers in this workshop.

The second half of the process is mainly evaporation. This is carried out in another workshop, which is not a wooden board shed but a row of bungalows, about three or four zhang long and five or six chi wide. When I went in, I realized that this decent workshop also served as a warehouse and office. The so-called evaporation equipment is really wonderful. This is a row of earthen stoves with earthen jars placed on them, and these earthen jars were originally used to hold sulfuric acid, but they were knocked off their thin necks and turned into evaporation jars. Opposite the earthen stove, along the wall is a row of wooden tables, on which are spread the bright blue transparent crystalline copper sulfate. This workshop, which is also a warehouse and office, has about six or seven people working in it.

In short, the characteristics of this chemical factory are: equipment is simple and crude; raw materials are waste utilization; workers are original street residents who learned the operation in one or two days. However, its daily production is also three or four hundred jin!

These three characteristics are also the common points of the people-run industry in Nanguan District. For example, the boron fertilizer factory. This factory developed from 20 or 30 people to more than 100 people in one month, and has now accepted orders from six southern provinces, producing one to two tons per day, which is in short supply. However, when this factory was first established, it was the same as the copper sulfate chemical factory mentioned above; even now (this refers to when I visited, that is, July 4), it is also simple and crude, with a few bungalows, stoves, and a dozen large vats placed under a temporary wooden shed that barely shelters from the wind and rain. Where do the raw materials come from? It is also waste utilization, waste mud from the borax factory. These ochre-colored boron muds are piled up on the road outside the door.

Another example is the "Oil and Fat Chemical Factory" on Zhishan Street, which is also unimpressive. The workshop of this factory is in the open air. Two brick stoves, three waste iron barrels, and a set of old iron pipes form a complete set of dry distillation equipment. The raw material is rosin, which has always been used as fuel. The history of the procurement of this set of equipment is worth writing about in detail. The bricks for building the stove were dug up from broken houses, and the large iron barrels and iron pipes were found in the waste product collection station. The two bungalows that serve as warehouses, laboratories, and offices were also built in three days using waste wood. The technician is a long-term relief recipient among the street residents. This factory initially had only five people, and now (early July) it has more than fifty. And it has already established thirteen boiler branch factories in Dunhua, where the raw materials are produced. The products include pine tar, turpentine, cart oil, Mao Bilu oil, and other seven or eight kinds. This factory is expanding every day, and it is expected that the daily output will reach 3,000 jin by the end of July.

In just one month, Nanguan District realized "every street runs factories, every household has no idlers," and fundamentally eliminated unemployment and lack of occupation. (Family women who originally did not engage in production are now running factories, and by the end of June, family women running industry accounted for 70% of the total). As of June 30, the district had established 295 factories. The face of the streets is changing every day; everywhere is a new atmosphere. Street work has also undergone great changes. In the past, what was the main content of street work? A large part of the time and energy was spent on solving residents' needs for food, clothing, work, relief, and mediating disputes among the masses; the work was very busy and also very passive. Now it is different. The main tasks of street work in the future are to manage production and cultural education, and to organize the masses to gradually realize the cultural revolution and the technological revolution.

Nanguan District also has a newly established "Comprehensive Chemical Experiment Factory," which I think is a measure to organize the masses to realize the technological revolution. This factory is run by the district and trains technicians for people-run industries and tries out new varieties. It is divided into six classes: 1. Photosensitive materials; 2. Petroleum analysis; 3. Plastics; 4. Urea; 5. Borax, boric acid, boron fertilizer, red alum; 6. Cement. When I visited, this factory had 58 senior high school students and 40 junior high school students, all young people in their teens and twenties, with girls accounting for more than half. The junior high school class graduates in one and a half months, and the senior high school class in one month; but it is said that there are often early graduates, although this factory has only been open for more than 20 days. During the study period, each person receives a government subsidy of 15 yuan per month. Therefore, this institution is named a factory, but it is actually a training class, a new type of technical school that focuses on practice, serving the people-run industry in Nanguan District, and at the same time developing these people-run industries. It can be said to be the "Academy of Sciences" of Nanguan District.

The new undertakings in the Nanguan District of Changchun City are just one example of the same new undertakings that have been established and are being established all over the country. The flower of people-run industry is blooming simultaneously all over the country under the light of the general line, and almost overnight. As far as the people-run industry in Nanguan District of Changchun is concerned, there are three types: ownership by the whole people, collective ownership, and transitional nature, most of which are collective ownership. Under the leadership and support of the Party, the masses raised funds themselves, some contributed people, and some contributed materials, and that's how they got started. Wages have not been set, and the masses say "as long as there is food to eat." The Chuantong Street Old Cloth Processing Factory in Nanguan District is entirely run by women. They brought wooden boards and mats from their homes, and transformed an abandoned cowshed into a factory building by themselves; then they "contributed what they had," you contributed a jar, and I contributed a pot, and equipped the factory, and then started working. This example is of typical significance.

Agricultural cooperatives running industry and street residents running industry are one of the fruits of the general line of building socialism. The mysterious concept of running chemical industry has been completely broken by the ordinary street residents of Nanguan District, Changchun City. Today's affairs are all焕然一新 (huanran yixin, completely new) overnight. When I wrote this note, it was almost a month since I visited, and these people-run industries, from nothing to something, must have grown from small to large. Its contribution to the national economy is immeasurable in the future. In addition to economic value, the political significance is also very significant. First of all, the social atmosphere has leaped to a new stage, and the relationship between street residents is very different from the past. The socialist consciousness of street residents has been universally improved, and the enthusiasm for developing production is surging. This is a great harvest that cannot be calculated with money figures! Now, street industry has only just begun, but it is already blooming with a hundred flowers and changing with each passing day. Future development will surely exceed our most daring imagination.

### 一、长春南关行

专栏：

    〔6月初，我到东北走了一趟，首尾一个月，所见种种新气象、新人新事，数也数不完。返京后抽工夫陆续追记，深愧观察不深入，文采不足，有负于那样灿烂沸腾的现实。8月1日记。〕
    一、长春南关行
    7月5日的“长春日报”第三版，登载了黄广生同志的“南关行”，共五首，第五首题为“硫酸铜化工厂”。一看题目，你也许这样想：至少这是几千立方公尺的建筑，拥有一群技术人员和几百工人的吧。可是，请读原诗：
        白木板，搭个棚，
        当中竖起一烟筒。
        拣来砖头砌炼炉，
        就能生产硫酸铜。
        硫酸铜，蓝莹莹，
        好像宝石闪光明。
        能作农业杀虫药，
        还能给人治眼睛。
        若问原料哪来的？
        土中铜屑加水澄。
    这首诗全部记实，没有一点夸张。我参观过这个化工厂。这样的厂，在长春市的南关区，不是两个三个，而是论百算。这就是大跃进中的民办工厂。正如“南关行”的弁言中所说：“白手起家、遍地开花的气象，正在祖国每一角落中蓬勃发展着，此仅一例”而已。
    我到长春那一天，长春市真是喜气洋洋，干劲十足。所见所闻，都是振奋人心的。你看：一队队的红旗，锣鼓喧天，向“七一”献礼，原来是全市的工业、基建、商业、科学文化、医务等两千多名职工代表向党报告，他们在十天内已经共提合理化建议六十一万件，超额十一万件实现了市工会在6月19日的号召。你看：长春市各高等学校已经建立和准备建立的工厂共有一百六十多个。东北师范大学只用十天时间就建成大小型工厂和车间一百多，产品三百多种、一千多件。你看：1957年长春市工业和手工业超过第一个五年计划原定的生产水平40.15％，比1952年提高80.85％，平均每年递增13.5％，而原计划是6％。你看：吉林省1957年工业总产值比1952年增长115.7％，全省工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重已由1952年的43.9％提高到63.4％。你听呵，吉林省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上栗又文省长的报告何等雄心勃勃！在第二个五年计划期间，吉林要实现水利化、机械化、电气化。你听，吉林全省新建和整修农田灌溉工程已达十五万八千多处，共可灌溉农田六十六万公顷，比原订计划增加五倍。你看，长春市人民正在学习首都人民兴修十三陵水库的榜样，准备以义务劳动兴建一座大水库，这就是新立城水库，和十三陵水库一样大，它建成以后，可以基本上满足全市第二个五年计划期间的工业用水和生活用水的需要！
    还有，你看，长春市煤气公司的技术员何树成在党的领导和支持和其他技术人员的帮助之下，敢想敢干苦钻研，经过二百四十多次的失败，终于成功地发明了“向煤灰要锗”的新方法，已经提炼出二百克的锗，雄辩地证明了它给我国提取锗的生产开辟了一条新的途径。这一发明，从废物中取宝，已经震动了技术界！
    大跃进中的奇迹是说不完的。现在我只打算说说许多奇迹中间看来是最平凡然而意义却巨大的一桩奇迹。这就是长春市南关区的民办工业。
    现在回过头去再看那个“硫酸铜化工厂”吧。木板棚不过两丈来长，丈把宽，四面通风，并无门窗；所谓“炼炉”，只是砖砌的煤灶，大小和我的家乡（嘉湖一带）通行的四眼灶仿佛，可只有两眼。原料是汽车厂的炉灰和垃圾（含铜屑）。用铲子把原料投入“炼炉”的第一眼，一小时后取出投入第二眼，又一小时取出放进大缸，缸里有水和硫酸，搅拌到水呈明蓝色，然后沉淀。前半的工序到此为止。在这些工序中，共用工人三名（或四名）。一位老大爷是司炉的，他掌握炉子里的热度，掌握原料加热的时间。一位老大娘管添料，也兼管搅拌。把加热后的原料放进大缸里加工的，是一位十几岁的姑娘，只她一人穿了件污旧的工作服。这是长背心式，好像是漆布之类的抗酸材料制的。如果我们称这个木板棚为车间，那么这个车间里的装备只是炉一座，大缸两只，这个车间里的工人只有三个。
    后半的工序主要是蒸化。这在另一车间进行，这不是木板棚而是一排平屋，大概三、四丈长，五、六尺宽。我进去一看，这才知道这个体面的车间原来还兼作库房和办公室。所谓蒸化设备，那真妙绝。这是安在土灶上的一排瓦罐，而这些瓦罐原来是盛硫酸的，却敲掉它的细颈，改为蒸化罐。土灶对面，靠墙一溜木板桌，上面摊着的，就是蓝莹莹的透明结晶体硫酸铜了。这个车间兼库房兼办公室，大约有六、七个人在工作。
    总而言之，这个化工厂的特点是：设备，因陋就简；原料，废物利用；工人，一二天就学会了操作的原来的街道居民。可是，它每天的生产量也有三、四百斤呢！
    这三个特点，实在也是南关区民办工业的共同点。例如硼肥厂。这个厂在一个月内从二、三十人发展到一百多，现在接受了南方六个省的订货单，每天生产一至二吨，供不应求。然而这个厂最初办的时候，跟上文讲过的硫酸铜化工厂一样；就是现在（这是指我参观的时候，即7月4日），它也是因陋就简的，几间平房，摆着锅灶，十几个大缸放在聊避风雨的临时搭成的木棚下。原料哪里来？也是废物利用，硼砂厂的废泥。门外路上就堆着这些赭色的硼泥。
    又如至善街的“油脂化工厂”也是其貌不扬的。这个厂的车间在露天。砖砌的两个炉子、三个废铁桶和一套旧铁管，组成了全套干馏的设备。原料是向来当作燃料的松明。这套设备的置办的历史，值得大书特书。砌炉子的砖是从破房子挖来的，大铁桶和铁管是在废品收购站里找来的。作为仓库、化验室和办公室的两间平房也是利用废旧木料在三天之内盖起来的。技师是街道居民中间一个长期救济户。这个厂最初只有五个人，现在（7月初）有五十多。并且已经在原料出产地的敦化建立了十三座锅炉的分厂。产品有松焦油、松节油、大车油、毛必鲁油等七、八种。这个厂，天天在扩建，预计到7月底，日产量可达三千斤。
    南关区在短短一个月内，实现了“街街办工厂、户户无闲人”，根本消灭失业和无职业现象。（本来不事生产的家庭妇女现在都办起工厂来了，6月底止，办工业的家庭妇女占总数70％）。截至6月30日止，全区已办工厂二百九十五个。街道面目，天天在改观；到处是一片新气象。街道工作也跟着发生大变化。从前，街道工作的主要内容是什么呢？很大一部分时间和力量用在解决居民的要吃、要穿、要工作、要救济和调解群众之间的纠纷；工作很忙乱，也很被动。现在可不同了。今后的街道工作主要是管理生产和文化教育，组织群众逐步实现文化革命和技术革命。
    南关区还有个新办的“综合化工实验厂”，我看就是组织群众实现技术革命的一个措施。这个厂是区办的，为民办工业培养技术人员，并试制新品种。这里分六班：一、感光材料；二、石油分析；三、塑料；四、尿素；五、硼砂、硼酸、硼肥、红矾；六、水泥。我去参观的时候，这个工厂有高中班五十八人，初中班四十人，全是十七、八乃至二十来岁的青年，女孩子占一半多。初中班一个半月毕业，高中班一个月；但据说，常常有提前毕业的，虽然这个工厂开办只有二十多天。学习期间，每人领公家补助每月十五元。因此，这个机构名为工厂，实在是训练班，是一种新式的以实习为主的技术学校，是为南关区民办工业服务的，同时也是为了发展这些民办工业的，它可以说是南关区的“科学院”。
    长春市南关区的新事业不过是全国各地的已办和正在办的同样新事业的一例而已。民办工业这朵花，是在总路线照耀之下在全国各地同时开放的，而且几乎是在一夜之间开放的。就长春南关区的民办工业而言，有全民所有制、集体所有制和过渡性质三种，其中大部分是集体所有制。党领导和支持，群众自己筹集资金，有人出人，有物出物，这样就办起来了。工资都没有定，群众说“只要有饭吃。”南关区长通街有一个旧布加工厂，完全是由妇女办起来的。她们从自己家里拿来了木板和席子，自己动手，就把一个废弃的牛棚改造为厂房；然后她们又“有啥出啥”，你出缸，我出锅，把厂装备起来，就开始工作。这一个例子是有典型意义的。
    农业合作社办工业，街道居民也办工业，这是建设社会主义总路线的果实之一。办化学工业的神秘观念完全被长春市南关区的普通的街道居民打破了。今天的事情都是一宿之间面目焕然一新的。我写这篇笔记的时候，离我参观的时间，将近一个月，这些由无到有的民办工业一定已经由小到大了。它对于国民经济的贡献，前途是不可限量的。经济价值而外，政治意义也十分重大。首先是社会风气跃进到新阶段，街道居民间的关系跟过去大不相同了。街道居民的社会主义觉悟普遍提高，发展生产的干劲蓬勃高涨，这是不能用金钱数字来计算的大收获！现在，街道工业还仅仅开始，却已经万花齐放，日新月异，将来的发展一定会超过我们最大胆的想像。
                    （7月28日）
