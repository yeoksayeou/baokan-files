    (Our newspaper dispatch) The "Art and Photography Exhibition in Support of the Arab People's Opposition to U.S. and British Aggression," jointly sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association and the China Photographic Society, opened on the 14th at the Beijing Art Exhibition Hall.
    The exhibition features over two hundred original artworks, including cartoons, propaganda posters, Chinese paintings, prints, and sculptures, all actively created by artists from various regions during the movement against U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East. Many traditional Chinese painters, who never usually paint propaganda posters, also created many pictures against U.S. and British aggression this time. Some of the works are original drafts of murals from the streets of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other cities.
    Many of the photographic works in the exhibition are also militant artworks. In addition to introducing the capitals of countries such as Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon, they also show the heroic struggle of the Arab people against U.S. and British armed aggression. Here, one can also see the unified action of peace-loving people all over the world to stop the war of aggression, as well as the active performance of the Chinese people in their respective production and construction posts in support of the struggle of the Arab countries. The exhibition also displays photos of the meeting between Chinese and Soviet leaders Chairman Mao and Chairman Khrushchev in Beijing.

    会上展出的二百余件美术原作中有漫画、宣传画、中国画、版画和雕塑作品，都是各地美术家在反对美英侵略中东运动中积极创作的，许多从来不画宣传画的国画家，这次也创作了许多反对美英侵略的图画。其中有的作品是北京、上海、广州等城市街头上的壁画原稿。
    展览会中许多摄影作品也是富有战斗性的艺术作品，除介绍了伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩等国家的首都风貌外，还有阿拉伯各国人民反对美英武装侵略的英勇斗争情况。在这里还能看到全世界爱好和平的人们为制止侵略战争的一致行动，中国人民为支援阿拉伯各国人民的斗争在各个生产建设岗位上的积极表现。展览会上还陈列了中苏两国领袖毛主席和赫鲁晓夫主席在北京会谈的照片。
