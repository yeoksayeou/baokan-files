　　Young Girl Breaks Down a Major Bad Custom

　　Yang Guilian, with a fiery heart, repeatedly told her grandmother about the benefits of raising boars, but her grandmother always refused. The last time, things came to a standstill, and her grandmother pointed at her head and said, "If you want to raise boars, then don't be a Yang!"

　　The matter of raising boars was indeed a new thing in the Zhaocun District of Lushan, Henan. For a long time, it had been rumored here that raising boars was demeaning and would lead to a decline in the family's population. It was even more of a novelty for a seventeen-year-old girl to raise boars.

　　Yang Guilian was troubled by this. She thought: If I force it, I left my mother when I was little and grew up with my grandmother. I can't bear to make her angry; if I don't raise them, I'm a member of the Communist Youth League, and the cooperative has more than eighty sows, but not even one boar. When the sows mate, they have to run to a place more than twenty miles away. This affects both production and the development of pig breeding. A young person, a member of the League, should never succumb to old habits!

　　After Yang Guilian bought a small boar, her grandmother was so angry that she separated from her. But she was determined to set an example, and then persuade her grandmother and educate the masses. Because she had no experience in raising pigs, the pig became thinner and thinner, and soon died. Some people sarcastically said, "Guilian's little boar has gone to heaven!" One failure did not discourage her. With the help of the Party branch, she bought another small boar, but after a few days, this small boar also died. Some people sarcastically said even more, "Dying one is not reassuring, buying another one goes to the underworld, wasted money, carried the burden, I think the little girl is too zhang jing (meaning showing off)." These two pig deaths caused Yang Guilian to shed many tears. But with the help and encouragement of the Party, after several setbacks, she finally achieved victory. Because she raised the boar, this year the cooperative can save one hundred and ninety-two workdays and run six thousand eight hundred and eighty fewer miles. Among the masses, not only can no sarcastic words be heard anymore, but everyone admires and praises this girl. Yang Guilian's family also increased its income because of this, and her relationship with her grandmother also improved.

　　小姑娘破除了大陋俗
    杨桂莲怀着一颗火热的心情，反来复去地给她奶奶讲喂养郎猪的好处，但她的奶奶始终不答应。最后一次，索性弄僵了，她的奶奶指着她的头说：“你要喂郎猪，就别姓杨！”
    喂郎猪这件事，在河南鲁山赵村区一带，的确还是一件新事儿。很长的时期，在这里流传着：喂郎猪下贱，会使家里人口不旺。一个十七岁的姑娘却要喂郎猪，更是奇闻。
    杨桂莲为这件事苦恼着。她想：强喂吧，自己一小就离开了亲娘，是跟奶奶长大的，不忍惹她老人家生气；不喂吧，自己是个共青团员，社里有八十多口母猪，连一口郎猪也没有。母猪交配时，却要跑到二十里以外的地方去。既影响了生产，也影响生猪的发展。一个青年人，一个团员，决不应当向旧习惯屈服！
    杨桂莲买了一口小郎猪后，奶奶气的和她分居了。但她决心做出个样子，再去说服奶奶和教育群众。由于她没有喂猪经验，猪越喂越瘦，不久猪便死了。有些群众讽刺说：“桂莲的小郎猪驾云上天啦！”一次失败，并没有使她灰心。在党支部的帮助下，她又买了一口小郎猪，但没过几天，这口小郎猪又死了。有些群众更加讽刺地说：“死了一口不安心，再买一口又归阴，花了钱，背了工，我看小妮太张精（逞能的意思）。”这两次死猪事件，使杨桂莲流过不少眼泪。但在党的帮助和鼓励下，她经过几次挫折后，终于取得了胜利。由于她喂了郎猪，今年社里就可节省一百九十二个劳动日，少跑六千八百八十里路。在群众中，不仅再也听不到讽刺的话，而且人人都在佩服和夸奖这位姑娘。杨桂莲的家里也因此增加了收入，她和奶奶的关系也和好了。
