　　Everything that is decadent in ideology and other unsuitable parts of the superstructure are crumbling day by day. It will still take time to completely sweep away this garbage; however, the trend of these things collapsing is certain.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Mao Zedong: "Introducing a Cooperative"

    The dispute between indigenous and foreign methods in the early rice experiment at the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute is essentially a struggle between two lines in the field of natural science. It is a struggle between the old, stale, bourgeois idealistic agricultural science theories and the new agricultural science knowledge continuously developed and created by the working people in practice.

    After the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, our country's construction has entered a new stage of cultural and technological revolution. The task of the technological revolution is to transfer all sectors of the national economy to a new technological basis, thereby promoting the rapid development of social productive forces. But how is the new technological basis to be established? Is it to follow the old footsteps left by predecessors, clinging to outdated old science and technology theories, and groping forward step by step? Or is it to break with convention, stand at the forefront of modern science and technology, summarize and develop new science and technology theories from the wisdom and practice of the working people, and catch up? This inevitably leads to a struggle between two lines and two methods.

    In the face of this serious struggle, what is the responsibility of the leaders? Is it for the local experts to listen to the foreign experts, or to resolutely advocate the combination of local and foreign methods? Is it to allow the existence of white flags, or to pull down the white flags and plant the red flags?

    We are Marxists, and we advocate taking the latter path. Because we firmly believe that science comes from practice and is the reflection and summarization of objective laws. As long as we rely on the working people who are in practice every day, and help them summarize their practical experience, we can recognize things that we could not recognize in the past and master knowledge that we did not master in the past. We will certainly be able to catch up quickly, fully master and fully utilize all the knowledge of natural science, and serve our socialist construction. However, around us there are still a group of intellectuals who come from bourgeois backgrounds or stand on the bourgeois standpoint. Although they have mastered some scientific knowledge from books in the past, they are divorced from reality, divorced from production, and divorced from the masses, and today they are unwilling to put down their airs to contact reality and connect with the masses. Therefore, in order to permanently maintain the "authority" of scientists, they intentionally or unintentionally regard scientific knowledge as a "protective talisman" for maintaining personal reputation and status. Not only do they not seek new development, but they use those stale scientific knowledge to build "theoretical fortresses" to scare the working people, compete with the working people, and confront reality. In simple terms, we want to open the door of science and enable natural science to gain the smoothest development in the hands of the proletariat and the working people; while the bourgeois intellectuals attempt to monopolize the throne of science and stubbornly resist the working people. This is the basic essence of the struggle between the two lines in the field of natural science today.

    This struggle is a very fierce battle for dominance, and it is one of the battlefields where we compete with the bourgeoisie after achieving victory on the political and ideological fronts. This struggle has already begun in many scientific and technological departments and even in all production departments, and it has become a common phenomenon in life. In the field of agricultural science, this year the working masses created high-yield records of more than 7,000 catties per mu for wheat and 30,000 to 40,000 catties per mu for early rice, immediately leaving many foreign, but stale, theories and viewpoints in agricultural science far behind. However, some "experts" who call themselves authorities are still shaking their heads and picking on everything, hiding in greenhouses to do their bonsai-style experiments, and some even still hold onto the Japanese experience of 1,200 catties per mu, reluctant to let go. The same is true in the industrial sector, where workers have broken many scientific conventions and created unprecedented and unrecorded miracles. But those bourgeois intellectual engineers are watching coldly from the sidelines, saying, "Your spirit is admirable, your style is very good, but we still need to study and research what role it actually plays." From this, it can be seen that this struggle is very acute.

    Some leaders of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute still have superstitious ideas, believing in experts, not believing in local experts, and not believing in the practice and wisdom of the broad masses, thus relaxing ideological leadership, putting down the red flag, and letting the white flag continue to fly. As a result, not only did the local experts fail to give full play to their strengths, but the experiment suffered a setback.

    Relying on the masses, combining local and foreign methods, and strengthening leadership are the three important methods we currently have for developing scientific and technological research. Among the three, strengthening leadership and putting politics in command is the most important link. Some leaders in scientific and technological research departments should learn from this failure, recognize the serious significance of the struggle between the two lines, better strengthen political and ideological leadership, resolutely pull down the white flag of bourgeois old science and false science, and make the red flag of proletarian true science fly high in the field of natural science.

### 插红旗——领导者的责任

　　插红旗——领导者的责任
　　张竞
　　一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。彻底扫除这些垃圾，仍然需要时间；这些东西崩溃之势已成，则是确定无疑的了。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　毛泽东：“介绍一个合作社”
    华东农业科学研究所在早稻试验中的土洋之争，实质上是自然科学领域中的两条道路之争。这是旧的陈腐的资产阶级唯心主义的农业科学理论同劳动人民在实践中不断发展和创造起来的新的农业科学知识之间的斗争。
    在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命取得胜利之后，我们国家的建设已进入了文化革命和技术革命的新阶段。技术革命的任务是要把国民经济的一切部门都转到新的技术基础上去，从而促进社会生产力飞跃地向前发展。但新的技术基础怎样建立起来呢？是循着前人留下的旧脚印，抱着早就过时的旧的科学技术理论，按部就班地摸索前进呢？还是冲破常规，站在现代科学技术的尖峰，从劳动人民的智慧和实践中总结和发展新的科学技术理论，迎头赶上去呢？这就必然地产生了两条道路两种方法的斗争。
    在这一场严重的斗争面前，领导者的责任是什么呢？是要土专家去听从洋专家，还是坚决主张土洋结合？是允许白旗存在，还是拔掉白旗插上红旗呢？
    我们是马克思主义者，是主张走后一条路的。因为我们坚定地认为科学是从实践中来，是客观规律的反映和总结。只要我们依靠每天都在实践中的劳动人民，帮助他们总结实践的经验，我们就能够认识过去所不能认识到的东西，掌握过去所没有掌握的知识。我们就一定能够急起直追，充分掌握和充分利用自然科学的全部知识，为我们社会主义建设服务。但是，在我们周围还有一批资产阶级出身或站在资产阶级立场上的知识分子，他们却希望我们走前一条道路。他们过去虽然掌握了一些书本上的科学知识，但他们脱离实际，脱离生产，脱离群众，而今天又不愿放下架子去接触实际，联系群众，因此他们为了想永远维护科学家的“权威”，便有意无意地把科学知识当作维护个人名誉地位的“护身符”，不但不求新的发展，却利用那些陈腐的科学知识筑起“理论的堡垒”，吓唬劳动人民，和劳动人民较量，和现实对抗。简单地说，我们要敞开科学的大门，使自然科学在无产阶级和劳动人民手中获得最顺利的发展；而资产阶级知识分子却企图独占科学的宝座，和劳动人民负隅顽抗。这就是今天在自然科学领域中两条道路斗争的基本实质。
    这个斗争是一场非常激烈的争夺战，是在政治思想战线上取得了胜利后，我们和资产阶级较量的战场之一。这一场斗争已经在许多科学技术部门以至一切生产部门中开始了，而且它已成了生活中的普遍现象。在农业科学方面，今年劳动群众创造了小麦亩产七千多斤，早稻亩产三、四万斤的高产纪录，一下就把农业科学中很多洋的然而却是陈腐的理论和观点远远地丢在后面去了。可是，有些自诩为权威的“专家”们，还在摇头晃脑地百般挑剔，躲在温室里做它那盆景式的试验，甚至有人到现在还抱着亩产一千二百斤的日本经验，爱不释手。在工业部门也同样如此，工人们打破了许多科学的常规，创造了史无前例、书无记载的奇迹。但那些资产阶级知识分子的工程师却在旁边冷眼旁观，说什么“你们精神可佩，风格很好，究竟起什么作用还要研究研究。”由此可见，这一场斗争是很尖锐的。
    华东农业科学研究所某些领导者还存在着迷信思想，迷信专家，不相信土专家，不相信广大群众的实践和智慧，因而放松了思想领导，放下了红旗，让白旗继续飘扬。结果是土专家非但没有发挥各人的长处，反而使这项试验遭受了失败。
    依靠群众，土洋并举，加强领导三者相结合，是目前我们发展科学技术研究工作的一个重要方法，三者之中，加强领导、政治挂帅是最主要的一环。科学技术研究部门的某些领导者，要从这一失败中吸取教训，认清两条道路斗争的严重意义，更好地加强政治思想领导，坚决地拔掉资产阶级旧科学假科学的白旗，使无产阶级的真科学的红旗在自然科学领域里高高飘扬。
