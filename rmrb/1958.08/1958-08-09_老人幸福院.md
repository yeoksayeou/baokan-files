　　Elderly Happiness Home
　　By our reporter Deng Zichang
　　West of Huairou County town, past the famous Huairou Reservoir, there is a lush and green place, which is the Elderly Happiness Home jointly established by twelve agricultural cooperatives in Qianqiaozi Township, Huairou County, to care for the "Five Guarantees" households.
　　On July 17th, when I visited here, the first batch of more than thirty old men and women had already moved in. The oldest was eighty-four years old, most were in their sixties or seventies, and a few were blind. They lived separately by gender (old couples lived together), four people in a room. In terms of food, they ate simple meals on weekdays, but could eat dumplings and meat soup once every seven days. So the old people chatted and laughed every day and lived happily.
　　The old people praised the fact that they didn't have to worry about food here, and they weren't lonely with so many people, which was a hundred times better than living alone before. Many people have already regarded this place as their own home and are doing public service things for the Happiness Home to the best of their ability. When I visited the canteen, I happened to see an old woman in her seventies taking millet for the chickens. It turned out that this old woman, in order to enable the Happiness Home to increase sideline income, asked to take on the job of raising chickens as soon as she arrived. Shi Chaosheng, from Qianqiaozi Village, is seventy-six years old this year and has more than thirty years of experience in growing vegetable gardens. He brought an iron pick, iron shovel, and small hand hoe. After entering the home, he was busy looking for land to reclaim and confidently declared: he would guarantee that everyone would eat the fresh vegetables he grew by the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. Now, there are already about twenty old people like these who automatically work for the Happiness Home, doing light work such as picking up manure, reclaiming land for planting vegetables, cutting pig grass, feeding pigs, feeding chickens, and maintaining environmental hygiene. They completely maintain the valuable character of the working people, and still love labor in their old age.
　　The sick and disabled old people praised the Happiness Home even more. The blind old woman, Meng Sunshi, had been widowed for many years. Before liberation, she lived by begging. After liberation, she was rescued by the state every year, and now she has entered the Happiness Home. The director, Li Deshan, often visited her, personally serving her food and water, and said to her: "I am your son, and I will take good care of you like my own mother." This old woman was very moved and said that she had really gone to heaven now! The old man Wang Juwen, originally a "Five Guarantees" household in Houqiaozi Village, told me that the cooperative took good care of the "Five Guarantees" households. Last year, he received more than 20 yuan and more than 400 catties of coarse grains, as well as pork, etc., but he had to cook his own meals, which was very inconvenient because of his leg problems. Now it's great, the home has a communal kitchen, and he doesn't have to worry about anything all day long. He has never felt so comfortable.
　　The old people get along very well and always care for and help each other. In the morning, some people vie to tidy up their bedding and clean up, and at night some people rush to burn firewood to warm the bed; those who can move help the sick and blind people to deliver food and soup, and help them to go to the toilet. When they are free, they chat for half a day. This is like a harmonious and interesting big family, and people are as close as old brothers and sisters.
　　The director of the Happiness Home, Li Deshan, introduced to me the simple process of establishing this Elderly Happiness Home. He said that this year the whole township is engaged in the Great Leap Forward in Production, and many collective canteens, nurseries, and other organizations have been established. Recently, after discussion among the cooperatives, it was decided to establish a Happiness Home for the "Five Guarantees" old people as well. This way, the "Five Guarantees" households can be better taken care of, and the cooperative cadres and members will no longer be distracted by taking care of the "Five Guarantees" households every day, and can concentrate on doing a good job in production. He said that the township party committee is very concerned and supportive of this matter, and immediately allocated houses; the members also helped to repair the walls, doors and windows, pig pens, etc., and used trucks to pick up the "Five Guarantees" households along with their household belongings. Li Deshan said that soon when all the "Five Guarantees" households in the township arrive, there will be sixty-seven households with ninety old people here. The agricultural cooperative will provide each of them with a total of sixty-five yuan per year in money and grain (calculated on average). At the same time, it is also necessary to appropriately organize the old people who can work to do light work such as feeding pigs, feeding chickens, and planting vegetables. The preliminary plan is to have an income of more than 1,800 yuan after the autumn harvest, and this money will be used to run welfare undertakings for the old people and further improve their lives.

### 老人幸福院

    老人幸福院
    本报记者  邓子常
    河北怀柔县城往西，经过著名的怀柔水库前行不远，有一个林木葱郁的地方，就是怀柔县前桥梓乡十二个农业社为照顾“五保”户最近联合办的老人幸福院。
    7月17日，我访问这里的时候，已经住下了第一批搬来的三十多个老大爷和老大娘。老人们最大的八十四岁，一般的是六、七十岁，还有几个人双目失明。他们男女分住（老俩口住在一起），每四人一间房。在吃的方面，平日粗茶淡饭，但七天可以吃一次饺子和肉菜汤。所以老人们一天有说有笑，生活过得很愉快。
    老人们见人就称赞这里吃饭不操心，人多不寂寞，比原先孤独过日子强过百倍。不少人已把这里当成自己的家一样看待，尽自己的力量为幸福院作公益事情。我参观食堂的时候，正好碰见一位七十多岁的老大娘在给小鸡取小米。原来，这个老婆婆为了使幸福院能够增加副业收入，一来就要求担任了养鸡的职务。从前桥梓村来的史朝生，今年七十六岁了，有三十多年种菜园子的老经验，他带来了铁镐、铁锨和小手锄，进院后就忙着找地开荒，还满有信心地宣告：保证8月中秋节让大伙吃上他种的新鲜菜。现在，像这些自动为幸福院作工作的老人已有二十来人，作的是拣粪积肥、开荒种菜、割猪草、喂猪、喂鸡、搞环境卫生等轻便活，他们完全保持着劳动人民的可贵本色，到老来还这样热爱劳动。
    有病的和残废老人，对幸福院更是赞不绝口。双目失明的孟孙氏老大娘，丈夫已死多年了，解放前靠乞讨过日子，解放后年年由国家救济，现在她又进了幸福院。院长李德山经常去问候她，亲自给她端饭送水，并对她说：“我就是您的儿子，要把您当亲娘一样地好好伺候”。这个老大娘非常感动，连说我现在真的上了天堂啦！老大爷王巨稳，原是后桥梓村的“五保”户，他告诉我：合作社很照顾“五保”户，去年他领得二十多元和四百多斤粗细粮，还有猪肉等等，但是要自己作饭，他的腿有病很不方便，现在可好啦，院里有大伙房，一天开门七件事全不操心，心里从来没有这样舒坦过。
    老人们相处得很好，总是互相体贴和帮助。早晨起床有人争着整理被褥和打扫清洁，晚上有人抢着烧火熏炕；能行动的人帮助有病的和双目失明的人送饭送汤，搀扶他们上厕所，闲下来一扯家常就是半天。特别是老大娘们的欢笑声经常可以听见。这里就像一个和睦而有趣的大家庭，人们就像老兄弟、老姐妹一样的亲亲热热。
    幸福院的院长李德山向我介绍了建立这个老人幸福院的简单经过情况。他说，今年全乡搞生产大跃进，办起了好多集体食堂、托儿组织等，最近各社一合计，就决定也要为“五保”老人们办个幸福院。这样作，既可使“五保”户得到更好的照顾，又可使社干部和社员不再为天天照顾“五保”户而分心，能够集中精力专心搞好生产。他说乡党委对这件事十分关心和支持，立刻拨给了房屋；社员们又帮助修整围墙、门窗、猪圈等，还用大车把“五保”户连同他们的居家用物一起接来。李德山说，不久等全乡“五保”户到齐时，这里将有六十七户共九十来个老人，农业社一年要供给他们每人钱、粮共合六十五元（按平均计算）。同时，这里还要适当组织可以劳动的老人作喂猪、喂鸡和种菜等轻便活，初步计划秋后可以收入一千八百多元，这一笔钱就用来为老人们举办福利事业和进一步改善生活。（附图片）
