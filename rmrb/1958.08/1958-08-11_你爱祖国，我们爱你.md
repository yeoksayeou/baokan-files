Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Wen:

　　In the surgical ward of a certain hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, lay a critically injured soldier. His name was Zhang Bingyu, a driver from a certain unit, a young man just over twenty. Doctors and nurses were both anxious about his injuries and moved by the heroic deeds they were spreading.

　　At noon on July 3rd, Zhang Bingyu, as usual, drove his oil tanker to the gas station to refuel.

　　Oil was flowing into the tanker at high speed through the delivery pipe. Zhang Bingyu wiped the sweat from his face and nimbly climbed onto the tanker to check if there was anything wrong with the connection between the delivery pipe and the tanker nozzle. Suddenly, a blue column of fire shot straight out from the joint of the oil pipe – gasoline had ignited due to static electricity!

　　Zhang Bingyu was immediately knocked down under the truck, his hair and body on fire. He rolled on the ground, trying to extinguish the flames on his body. But as he was rolling, he looked up and saw the entire tanker was burning. So, he scrambled up, covered in flames, and ran to the driver's cab. At that moment, he was very clear that if he did not immediately drive away this burning oil truck, the safety of the gas station could not be guaranteed; if the gas station caught fire, it would cause a fire at the oil depot, which would cause great losses to the country!

　　The oil truck drove away, spewing flames. But it only went seven or eight meters before stopping. The heroic soldier Zhang Bingyu was burned so badly by the fire that he could no longer move.

　　The heroic soldier Zhang Bingyu was rescued by his comrades to the hospital. His back, face, arms, ribs, and legs were almost completely charred. The burn area accounted for more than 50% of his body, the depth reaching one centimeter, and body fluids were constantly flowing out from under the festered skin. People were worried about his serious injuries. However, as soon as Zhang Bingyu regained consciousness, he immediately asked: "Did the oil depot catch fire?" "Is my truck broken?" When his comrades told him that the oil depot was intact, his eyes, full of vitality, shone with a light of relief.

　　Faced with such a heroic soldier who loved the property of the motherland, how could one not be moved and respectful? The doctors and nurses unanimously expressed: we must do everything possible to save the hero's life.

　　After the start of treatment, continuous blood transfusions and infusions were ineffective for Zhang Bingyu for several days. Chen Xuan, the director of surgery, found that unless the patient's body fluid loss could be stopped, no matter how much blood and fluid was transfused, it would be in vain, and his burned skin had already begun to ulcerate.

　　The doctors felt even heavier than the patient. They thought about it and found that the only effective treatment was "skin grafting." That is to say, some good skin from people with "O" blood type had to be cut off and transplanted onto the wounded soldier.

　　Department Director Chen Xuan was the first to sign up, saying: "To save the life of a heroic soldier, what does it matter if we cut off some skin? This is our glory!" Under his leadership, a voluntary "skin donation" campaign immediately unfolded. Doctor Wang, who was eight months pregnant, was among the first to sign up, and nurse Liu Qingcai also firmly requested to donate skin. When the news reached the Department of Internal Medicine, the entire department made a guarantee: how much is needed, we will donate how much!

　　In this way, the class love of comrades filled the entire military hospital. The "skin grafting" operation was successfully completed. The body of the wounded soldier Zhang Bingyu grew the skin and flesh of comrades, infused with the blood of comrades. His young life was revived.

　　One morning, when the soft sunlight shone through the window onto the hospital bed, awakening soldier Zhang Bingyu, Department Director Chen Xuan walked in, limping. The soldier's eyes fell on the two large bandages tied to the doctor's legs, and he gazed intently, unable to hold back his tears. The doctor walked to the soldier's side, also too moved to speak for a long time. Finally, he quietly said to the heroic soldier: "You love the motherland, we love you."

### “你爱祖国，我们爱你”

　　“你爱祖国，我们爱你”
　　新华社记者　宋文
    在中国人民解放军某医院外科的病房里，躺着一个危急的伤员。他叫张炳雨，是某部汽车驾驶员，一个刚二十冒头的小伙子。医生和护士们一面为他的伤势着急，一面感动地传颂着他的英雄事迹。
    7月3日中午，张炳雨还是像往常一样，驾起他的油糟车，开到加油站去加油。
    油，顺着输油管高速度地向油糟里流着。张炳雨抹了抹脸上的汗，轻捷地登上油糟，想看看输油管和油糟嘴的接合处是否有什么毛病。突然，一股蓝色的火柱，从油管的接合处直冲出来——由于静电反应，汽油燃烧起来了！
    张炳雨当即被喷倒在车下，头发、身上都着了火。他在地上打着滚，想把身上的火熄灭。可是正滚着，猛抬头，见整个油糟都燃烧起来了。于是，他一骨碌爬起来，带着满身的火，往汽车驾驶室里跑。这时，他非常清楚，如果不马上开走这台着了火的油车，就难保加油站的安全；加油站一旦失火，就要引起油库的火灾，那将会为国家造成多大的损失！
    油车喷着火舌开走了。但只走了七八公尺，就停下来。英雄的战士张炳雨，被烈火烧得再也不能动了。
    英雄的战士张炳雨被战友们抢救到医院里。他的背、脸、两臂、两肋和双腿，差不多全被烧焦了，烧伤的面积占全身的50％以上，深度达一公分，体液从焦烂了的皮肤下面，片刻不停地朝外淌着。人们都为他的严重伤势担忧。可是，张炳雨刚清醒过来，便立刻发问：“油库失火了没有？”“我的车坏了没有？”当战友们告诉他油库完好无损时，他那充满生命力的眼睛，闪烁出欣慰的光芒。
    面对着这样一位热爱祖国财产的英雄战士，怎能不使人感动、崇敬呢？医生和护士们一致表示：要想尽一切办法，挽救英雄的生命。
    在开始治疗以后，连续几天为张炳雨输血和输液都无效。外科主任陈轩发现：在病人的体液流失不能制止以前，就是输再多的血和液，也是白搭，而且，他烧伤的皮肤已经开始溃烂了。
    医生的心情比病人还沉重。他们想来想去，找到唯一的有效疗法是“植皮”。这就是说，要把“O”型血的人的好皮肤割下一些来，移植到伤员的身上去。
    科主任陈轩第一个报了名，他说：“为了挽救英雄战士的生命，我们割下一些皮来算得什么？这正是我们的光荣！”在他的带头下，一个自愿“献皮”的行动便马上展开了。王医生已怀孕八个月，争先报上名，理科护士刘清才也坚决请求献皮。当消息传到内科的时候，全科的人员便提出保证：需要多少，我们献多少！
    就这样，阶级的同志的爱情充满了整个军医院。“植皮”的手术顺利地进行结束了。伤员张炳雨的身上长起了同志的皮肉，浸润着同志的血液。他年青的生命复苏了。
    一天早晨，当柔和的阳光透过窗户照射到病床上，唤醒战士张炳雨的时候，科主任陈轩一步一跛地走进来了。战士的眼光落在医生腿上绑着的两块大纱布上，激动地注视着，不禁热泪满盈。医生走到战士的身边，也激动得好久说不出话来，最后，他悄悄地向这位英雄的战士说：“你爱祖国，我们爱你”。
