Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Dispatch: A large-scale electrified open-pit coal mine has recently begun construction in the Lao Ha River coalfield in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia. Once completed, this open-pit mine will be able to produce 5 million tons of lignite annually.

This open-pit mine will be built using a method of simultaneous exploration, design, and construction. The entire process, from design to construction, will be undertaken by our own forces, and all the latest domestic technology and equipment will be used.

According to the explored data, the coal reserves in this mining area amount to 137 million tons, and the thickest part of the coal seam reaches 47 meters. Calculated at an annual output of 5 million tons, it can be mined for more than 20 years.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi Dispatch: The first cotton textile factory in the Tarim Basin, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has recently started construction. The Kashgar Cotton Textile Mill, designed with a scale of 100,000 spindles, is a combined textile, printing, and dyeing factory. After the completion of the first phase of construction in 1960, 50,000 spindles will be put into production. It can produce more than 1.6 million bolts of eight kinds of cotton textiles, such as twill, thread serge, and corduroy, and print and dye more than 1.3 million bolts of various colored cloths and printed fabrics annually.

The Tarim Basin has little rain and abundant sunshine throughout the year, making it an ideal cotton-growing area in our country, and it is also the main area for Xinjiang to build a cotton-growing base. After the completion of the Kashgar Cotton Textile Mill, the large amount of cotton produced in the oases of the Kashgar River and Yarkand River basins in the western Tarim Basin can be processed locally into textiles.

　　内蒙古建大煤矿　电气化露天开采
　　塔里木办纺织厂　种棉花就地加工
    据新华社呼和浩特电　一个电气化的大型露天煤矿最近在内蒙古昭乌达盟老哈河煤田上正式开工兴建。这个露天矿建成以后，能年产褐煤五百万吨。
    这个露天矿将采取边勘探、边设计、边施工的办法建成，从设计到施工都由我国自己的力量来承担，并且将全部采用国产最新技术设备。
    根据已经探明的资料，这个矿区储煤量达一点三七亿吨，煤层最厚处达四十七公尺；以年产五百万吨计算，可开采二十多年。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区塔里木盆地最近动工兴建第一座棉纺织厂。这个设计规模为十万纱锭的喀什棉纺织厂，是纺织、印染联合工厂，到1960年完成第一期建厂工程后，就有五万纱锭投入生产，可以年产斜纹布、线哔叽、灯芯绒等八种棉纺织品有一百六十多万匹，印染各种色布、花布一百三十多万匹。
    塔里木盆地终年少雨，日照充足，是我国理想的植棉区，也是新疆建设植棉基地的主要地区。喀什棉纺织厂建成以后，塔里木盆地西部喀什噶尔河、叶尔羌河流域绿洲上生产的大量棉花，就可以就地加工成纺织品。
