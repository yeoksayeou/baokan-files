Liberating Ourselves from Superstition
Commentator of this Newspaper

Reading the news about the reforms of backward customs and habits by various ethnic minorities is truly heartening. Based on the rectification campaign and socialist education, and encouraged by the General Line, various brotherly ethnic groups are eagerly demanding to develop production and improve culture, and have declared war on all backward customs and habits that hinder or even damage the development of productive forces and impede social progress.

The vast majority of people actively and enthusiastically support this bold revolutionary action of the ethnic minorities. However, a small number of people hold a negative attitude. Some say that many ethnic minorities have low levels of awareness and culture, and will not have demands for reforming customs and habits. Generally speaking, the development of economy and culture in ethnic minority areas is more backward than in Han areas. But what is the reason for this? Isn't it precisely the backward modes of production and all the bad customs and habits that have grown up on this backward mode of production? Since the liberation of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically completed in the vast majority of ethnic minority areas, and the old relations of production have been replaced by new socialist relations of production; and the majority of ethnic minority people have also experienced a socialist revolution on the political and ideological front last year, their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes, they have new views on many issues, and they are no longer superstitious about those outdated things. This shows that, in the vast majority of ethnic minority areas, not only has the foundation for the emergence of backward customs and habits begun to change, but people are increasingly developing a strong desire to reform them.

Some say that the customs and habits of ethnic minorities should only be respected and not reformed. This statement is also incorrect. This is confusing "respect" with "approval." Generally speaking, our Party, the government, and the Han people have always respected the customs and habits of ethnic minorities. Whether to preserve or reform a custom or habit must also be carried out consciously by the ethnic minority people. However, respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities does not mean approving and preserving all customs and habits. Everyone knows that, among the customs and habits of various ethnic minorities, some are good and should be preserved; some are bad, and even extremely harmful, and urgently need to be reformed. When ethnic minorities have not found these customs and habits to be bad and hindering production, we have a responsibility to point out which customs and habits are good and which are bad, so that ethnic minorities can choose for themselves. When ethnic minority people have not yet realized that certain backward customs and habits should be reformed, we need to wait patiently and conduct propaganda and education for them, and never force them to reform. Forced methods will not only fail to reform backward customs and habits, but will also hinder unity among the people and have a bad impact on production and work. When ethnic minority people already have the desire to reform backward customs and habits, we should actively support them and help them realize their wishes. Doing so is not contradictory to respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, but is completely consistent.

Of course, reforming backward customs and habits must be carried out analytically, planned, and step-by-step, based on the awareness and actual needs of the masses. Whatever urgently needs to be reformed and can be reformed early should be reformed early; although it also urgently needs to be reformed, but the conditions are not yet mature, we should wait until the conditions are mature before carrying out the reform. This way, we can better promote the development of various ethnic minorities without being detached from the ethnic minority people. Some may say that it is difficult to distinguish these. In fact, it is not difficult. Any custom or habit has a direct or indirect impact on the people's production, life, and health. Some affect only one aspect, some affect all three aspects, and ultimately, they all directly or indirectly affect production. The worst impact on production is also the most outdated thing. Through propaganda and education, the masses can more easily recognize its harm; after the reform, the benefits obtained by the masses also come more quickly and significantly. Therefore, what urgently needs to be reformed is what has the worst impact on production. Only by getting rid of those worst things can the good things play a greater role and further promote the demise of all bad things.

Some people worry that changing customs and habits will eliminate national characteristics. This concern is unnecessary. What needs to be reformed are backward customs and habits, not all customs and habits. Since backward customs and habits have already affected the development of a certain ethnic group, after the reform, that ethnic group will be able to develop rapidly, what is wrong with that? The characteristics of an ethnic group are not only manifested in backward customs and habits, but also in other aspects. At the same time, national customs are also changing. In the development of socialist construction, the contact between various ethnic groups is increasing, and in the process of common progress, what is abandoned by everyone is always the old and backward things; what is mutually absorbed and permeated is the new and progressive things.

Cadres of all ethnic groups working in ethnic minority areas should recognize this inevitability of social development, and together with the activists among the ethnic minorities, actively help the masses carry out the work of changing customs and habits, and push the socialist construction of all ethnic groups to a new upsurge.

　　从迷信中解放出来
　　本报评论员
    读了各少数民族改革落后风俗习惯的消息，真叫人高兴。在整风和社会主义教育的基础上，在总路线的鼓舞下，各个兄弟民族迫切要求发展生产和提高文化，向一切阻碍甚至破坏生产力发展、妨碍社会进步的落后的风俗习惯宣了战。
    对于少数民族人民这一大胆的革命行动，绝大部分人是积极热情地加以支持的。但是，也有一小部分人抱着消极态度。有的人说，许多少数民族的觉悟和文化都不高，不会有改革风俗习惯的要求。一般地说，少数民族地区经济文化的发展，要比汉族地区落后。但是，是什么原因呢？难道不正是落后的生产方式和在这种落后生产方式上生长起来的一切不良的风俗习惯吗？全国解放以来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，绝大多数少数民族地区，已经基本上完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，旧的生产关系被新的社会主义的生产关系代替了；而多数少数民族人民，在去年又经历了一场政治和思想战线上的社会主义革命，他们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，对于许多问题都有了新的看法，不再迷信那些陈旧过时的东西了。这就说明，在绝大多数少数民族地区，不但产生落后的风俗习惯的基础已经开始改变了，而且人们正日益滋长着改革它们的强烈愿望。
    有人说，对少数民族的风俗习惯只应尊重不应改革。这种说法也是不对的。这是把“尊重”和“赞同”混淆起来了。总的说来，对于少数民族的风俗习惯，我们的党、政府和汉族人民历来都是尊重的。保存或改革一种风俗习惯，也必须由少数民族人民自觉地来进行。但是，尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，并不等于赞同和保存一切风俗习惯。谁都知道，在各少数民族的风俗习惯中，有些是好的，应该保存下来；有些是不好的，甚至是极端有害的，亟需进行改革。在少数民族没有发现这些风俗习惯不好，并且妨碍生产的时候，我们有责任指出哪些风俗习惯好，哪些风俗习惯不好，让少数民族去自己选择。在少数民族人民还没有认识到应对某些落后风俗习惯进行改革的时候，我们需要耐心的等待，并对他们进行宣传教育，决不要强迫他们进行改革。强迫的办法，不但不可能改革落后的风俗习惯，而且会妨碍人民之间的团结，对生产和工作发生不好的影响。在少数民族人民已经有了改革落后风俗习惯的要求时，我们就应该积极加以支持，帮助他们实现自己的愿望。这样作同尊重少数民族的风俗习惯不矛盾，而且是完全一致的。
    当然，改革落后的风俗习惯，一定要根据群众的觉悟和实际的需要，有分析、有计划、有步骤地进行。凡是急需改革，又可以早日改革的，就应该早日改革；虽然也急需改革，但条件还不成熟的，就应该等条件成熟了，再进行改革。这样作，既能更好地促进各少数民族的发展，又不致脱离各少数民族人民。有人或许说，分清这些很困难。其实，并不难。任何一种风俗习惯，都对人民的生产、生活和身体的健康，有着直接的或间接的影响。有的，影响只及于一面，有的对这三方面都有影响，而归根到底，又都直接或间接地影响着生产。对生产影响最坏的，也正是最过时的东西。通过宣传教育，群众比较容易认识到它的坏处；改革以后，群众得到的好处，也来得比较快而显著。因此，急需改革的，就是对生产影响最坏的。只有改掉了那些最坏的，好的东西才能发挥更多的作用，并进一步促成一切坏的东西的消亡。
    有的人担心，改变了风俗习惯，就没有了民族特点。这种顾虑是不必要的。要改革的是落后的风俗习惯，而不是一切风俗习惯。既然落后的风俗习惯，已经影响到某个民族的发展，改革以后，某个民族就能得到迅速的发展，这有什么不好呢？一个民族的特点，也不仅表现在落后的风俗习惯上，还表现在其他各个方面。同时，民族习俗也是在变化着的。在社会主义建设事业的发展中，各民族的接触越来越多，在共同进步的过程中，被大家抛弃的，总是陈旧、落后的东西；被相互吸收、彼此渗透的，是新的、进步的东西。
    在少数民族地区工作的各族干部，应该认清社会发展的这种必然性，同各少数民族中的积极分子一起，积极地帮助群众进行移风易俗工作，把各族人民的社会主义建设推向一个新的高潮。
