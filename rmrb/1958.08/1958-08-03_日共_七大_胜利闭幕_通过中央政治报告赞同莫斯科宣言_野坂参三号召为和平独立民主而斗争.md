Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: The Japanese Communist Party's Seventh Congress, which opened in Tokyo on July 21st, victoriously concluded on August 1st.

The congress unanimously adopted the JCP Central Committee's political report and the report on the two declarations of the 1957 Moscow Conference. The congress endorsed the two declarations issued in Moscow. The congress adopted the articles of the Party Constitution in the draft Party Constitution, and added a preamble, which stipulated the general tasks of the party. Regarding the program (Party Program) part of the draft Party Constitution, due to insufficient time for discussion, on the suggestion of Miyamoto Kenji, a member of the Central Presidium, it was decided that the "Seventh Congress" would not make a final conclusion on the new Party Program for the time being, and that it would be handed over to the entire party for continued in-depth discussion, and then be adopted by the next Congress. The congress also declared the 1951 JCP Program invalid.

The congress elected a new central leadership: thirty-one members of the Central Committee; six alternate members; and seven members of the Central Inspection and Audit Commission. The new Central Committee convened a meeting on the afternoon of August 1st, which elected Nosaka Sanzō as Chairman of the JCP Central Committee, Miyamoto Kenji as Secretary-General of the Central Committee, and Haruichi Shōjirō as Chairman of the Central Inspection and Audit Commission.

At the meeting on August 1st, a resolution was also passed calling on the entire party to concentrate its efforts on striving for victory in next year's local elections and the House of Councillors elections. The meeting also decided that the Central Committee should draft and publish an "Open Letter to the Japanese People."

Nosaka Sanzō gave a concluding speech on behalf of the Central Committee. He said that the congress promoted the further strengthening of the party's unity. He believed that the victorious conclusion of the JCP's "Seventh Congress" would become a solid foundation for the JCP's future advancement.

Nosaka pointed out that the important tasks of the Japanese Communist Party are to fight for Japan's peace, independence, democracy, improvement of the people's living standards, and the realization of a socialist society. Nosaka said that this is a proud task that only the JCP can accomplish.

Nosaka said that although there are still problems to be solved at this congress, it has basically and successfully completed all the work that could be done.

Nosaka called on all party members to unite more closely, go deep into the masses, and fight with the masses to achieve the party's lofty goals. He pointed out that only in this way can the JCP be forged into a powerful vanguard of the working people.

Nosaka emphasized that as long as the whole party is united, it will surely overcome any difficulties.

Nosaka also said in his closing remarks that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent a delegation to attend the JCP's "Seventh Congress," giving the JCP great encouragement. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the CPSU. At the same time, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the fraternal parties of various countries and other political parties and mass organizations for their friendly congratulatory messages to the JCP's Seventh Congress.

The congress concluded with the singing of The Internationale. (Image attached)

    日共“七大”胜利闭幕
    通过中央政治报告赞同莫斯科宣言
    野坂参三号召为和平独立民主而斗争
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：7月21日在东京举行的日本共产党第七次代表大会已经在8月1日胜利闭幕。
    大会一致通过了日共中央委员会的政治报告和关于1957年莫斯科会议两个宣言的报告。大会赞同在莫斯科发表的两个宣言。大会通过了党章草案中的党章条款部分，并且加上了前文，在前文中规定了党的一般任务。关于党章草案的纲领（党纲）部分，由于讨论的时间不够，在中央主席团委员宫本显治建议下，决定“七大”对新党纲暂时不作最后结论，并且把它交给全党继续进行深入的讨论，然后由下次代表大会加以通过。大会还宣布1951年的日共纲领无效。
    大会选出了新的中央领导机构：中央委员会委员三十一人；候补委员六人；中央监察和检查委员会委员七人。新的中央委员会在8月1日下午召开了会议，会议选出野坂参三为日共中央委员会主席、宫本显治为中央委员会总书记，春曰庄次郎为中央监察和检查委员会主席。
    在8月1日的大会上，还通过一项决议号召全党集中力量为明年地方选举和参议院选举的胜利而奋斗。会上还决定由中央委员会起草和发表“告日本人民书”。
    野坂参三最后代表中央委员会作了总结发言。他说，这次大会促进了党的团结进一步加强。他相信日共“七大”的胜利闭幕将成为日共今后跃进的巩固基础。
    野坂指出，日本共产党所负的重大任务是为日本的和平、独立、民主、提高人民生活水平和实现社会主义社会而斗争。野坂说，这是只有日共才能完成的值得夸耀的任务。
    野坂说，这次大会虽然还留下有待解决的问题，但是大会已经基本上胜利地完成了一切能够做的工作。
    野坂号召全体党员更加紧密的团结起来，深入群众，同群众一起为实现党的崇高目标而斗争。他指出，只有这样，才能把日共锻炼成为一支强大的劳动人民的先锋队。
    野坂强调说，只要全党团结一致，一定能克服任何困难。
    野坂还在闭幕词中说，苏联共产党中央派遣代表团出席日共“七大”，给予日共以极大的鼓励。他特向苏共表示衷心感谢。同时，他对各国兄弟党和其他政党和群众团体致日共七大的富于友谊的贺词表示衷心的感谢。
    大会在高唱国际歌声中闭幕。（附图片）
