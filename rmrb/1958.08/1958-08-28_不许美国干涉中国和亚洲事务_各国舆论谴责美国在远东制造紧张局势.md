Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The United States' intensified military activities in the Taiwan area, threatening China's security, have been strongly condemned by public opinion in various countries.

Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association Says
Whoever Attacks China Will Bring Destruction Upon Themselves

Sundaral, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association, condemned the US Seventh Fleet's "state of alert" as a threat to China and world peace.

While presiding over a reception held by the Delhi branch of the India-China Friendship Association to welcome Guo Qinglan on the evening of the 26th, Sundaral warned, "Whoever attacks China is seeking their own destruction, and those who want to interfere in Chinese or Asian affairs will be eliminated." Guo Qinglan is the wife of Indian medical team leader Kotnis, who contributed his life to the Chinese people's national liberation war.

Amidst constant cheers, he said, "Taiwan, Quemoy, and Matsu are parts of mainland China. Why are the Americans there? Who invited them to interfere in other countries' internal affairs? Let the American imperialists understand the signs of an impending crisis. Let them realize that India, all Arab countries, the Soviet Union, socialist countries, truth, and justice are all on China's side."

Sundaral loudly said that the US Seventh Fleet should immediately withdraw from Taiwan. He said, "I tell every American and every Englishman: Get out of Asia! Get out of Asia!" At this point, the entire audience cheered loudly.

Sri Lankan Peace Leader Says
Asian Countries Must Unite to Deal with US Conspiracy

Sri Lankan peace movement leader and Lenin Peace Prize laureate, Thero Saranankara, said that US rulers are interfering in the affairs of China, India, Sri Lanka, and other countries, and they spare no effort to create disputes in these countries. The recent order for the Seventh Fleet to be in a "state of alert" has already created a serious danger of war. India, China, Japan, and other Asian countries must unite to deal with this danger.

Saranankara said that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is the greatest guarantee of world peace, which is why the American imperialists want to undermine China. He believes that a strong public opinion must be formed to make Dulles and Eisenhower feel fear in their hearts.

Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" Says
Tension in the Far East is Created by the United States

The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on the 25th saying that the United States' aggressive policy towards China has created tension in the Far East.

The newspaper condemned the US aggressive actions in the Taiwan area. It said, "Doesn't the Chinese government have a 'legitimate reason to be uneasy about the US Seventh Fleet stationed in the Taiwan waters? Can the US military support for the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan and the establishment of missile bases in Taiwan be considered a contribution to peace in the region?'"

The newspaper pointed out that Taiwan, Quemoy, and Matsu are integral parts of the territory of the People's Republic of China. It said that, in fact, the tension in the Far East is caused by the United States' "unrealistic policy" towards China.

"Amrita Bazar Patrika" said that unless the United States changes its policy, the situation in this region "will always be explosive."

Indonesian "People's Daily" Says
US Instigation of Chiang Gang Provocations Met with Due Retaliation

Jakarta's "People's Daily" published an editorial saying that the provocations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Quemoy area were obviously instigated by the United States.

The editorial said that China's counterattack forced the Chiang Kai-shek clique to announce its huge casualties. This fact is a warning to the American imperialists.

The newspaper pointed out that the passage of the ten-nation proposal at the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Meeting showed that the whole world believes that the United States and Britain are indeed carrying out aggression in the Middle East. In this situation, in order to divert world attention as soon as possible, the United States and Britain believe that they must create tension in other parts of the world.

Burmese "Rangoon Daily" Says
US Troops Stationed in Quemoy and Matsu are Acts of Aggression

Influential "Rangoon Daily" prominent commentator U Yan Gon wrote on the 26th, what reason does the United States have to station its naval forces in the Taiwan Strait and send its military advisory groups to Quemoy Island? The commentator pointed out that these actions by the United States are acts of aggression.

The commentator pointed out that the Americans, who constantly talk about respecting human freedom and the sovereignty of all countries, say one thing but do another. He said that the United States has carried out boundless interference in East Asia. There will only be peace when the US Navy withdraws from Asia and cancels its military bases.

The "Mirror" editorial on the 26th also condemned the US aggressive act of occupying Taiwan. It said that the US Navy stationed in the Taiwan Strait is a threat to China.

Influential "Burma New Light of Burma" published an editorial on the 27th saying that this activity of the United States is purely an act of interfering in China's internal affairs.

The newspaper said that the US and Chiang Kai-shek clique's upcoming joint naval exercises in the Taiwan Strait are "a threat and provocation to the Chinese people."

The newspaper pointed out that no country has any reason to interfere in China's internal affairs. But "the United States is interfering in China's internal affairs with a strong military force. If a war breaks out in this region because of this situation, then it must be recognized that the responsibility should be borne by the United States."

French "Liberation" Says
The United States Cannot Intimidate the Chinese People

Paris's "Liberation" pointed out in a commentary on the 26th that the current tension in the Taiwan area was provoked by the US-Chiang clique. But the Chinese people cannot be intimidated.

The commentary said that a month ago, Chiang Kai-shek threatened to resume air raids on the mainland. Last week, reinforcements were sent to Quemoy and Matsu. Therefore, the Chinese People's Liberation Army retaliated with prolonged and fierce shelling by artillery, air force, and navy.

The newspaper exposed American conspiracies and intimidation, pointing out that it is very clear that one of the purposes of the malicious provocations that the United States is carrying out against People's China today is to hinder countries like France from fundamentally changing their policies towards China.

　　不许美国干涉中国和亚洲事务
    各国舆论谴责美国在远东制造紧张局势
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国在台湾地区加紧军事活动、威胁我国安全的行径，受到了各国舆论的严厉谴责。
    印中友协主席说
    谁要进攻中国，谁就自取灭亡
    印中友好协会主席森德拉尔谴责美国第七舰队“进行戒备”的行动是对中国和世界和平的威胁。
    森德拉尔26日傍晚在主持印中友好协会德里分会为欢迎郭庆兰而举行的招待会时警告说：“谁要进攻中国，谁就是自寻灭亡，那些要干涉中国或者亚洲事务的人必将消灭。”郭庆兰是在中国人民的民族解放战争中贡献了自己生命的印度医疗队长柯棣华的妻子。
    他在不断的欢呼声中说：“台湾、金门和马祖这些岛屿是中国大陆的一部分。为什么美国人要到那里去？谁曾经请他们到那里去干涉他国内政的？让美帝国主义者理解到危机迫在眉睫的预兆。让他们认识到，印度、所有阿拉伯国家、苏联和社会主义国家、真理和正义都在中国这一边。”
    森德拉尔大声说，美国第七舰队应当立即撤出台湾。他说：“我告诉每一个美国人和每一个英国人：退出亚洲！退出亚洲！”这时全场高声欢呼。
    锡兰和平领袖说
    亚洲国家必须团结对付美国阴谋
    锡兰和平运动领袖、列宁和平奖金获得者撒拉南卡拉法师说，美国统治者正在干涉中国、印度、锡兰以及其它国家的事务，他们不遗余力地想在这些国家中制造纠纷。最近命令第七舰队“进行戒备”的行动就已经造成了严重的战争危险。印度、中国、日本以及其它亚洲国家必须团结起来对付这种危险。
    撒拉南卡拉说，中国和苏联的友谊是世界和平的最大保证，这就是美帝国主义者要破坏中国的原因。他认为必须形成强有力的舆论，使杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔内心感到恐惧。
    印度“甘露市场报”说
    远东紧张局势是美国造成的
    印度“甘露市场报”25日发表社论说，美国对中国的侵略政策造成了远东紧张局势。
    这家报纸谴责美国在台湾地区的侵略行为。它说，难道中国政府没有“正当理由对美国第七舰队驻在台湾海面感到不安吗？美国对台湾国民党残余的军事支持和在台湾建立导弹基地，难道又能够认为是对该地区和平的贡献吗？”
    这家报纸指出，台湾、金门、马祖是中华人民共和国领土的组成部分。它说，事实上，远东的紧张局势是美国对中国的“不现实政策”所造成的。
    “甘露市场报”说，除非美国改变政策，否则这个地区的局势“将永远是爆发性的”。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说
    美国唆使蒋帮挑衅受到应有反击
    雅加达“人民日报”发表社论说，蒋介石集团在金门地区的挑衅显然是美国唆使的。
    社论说，中国的反击使蒋介石集团不得不宣布它的巨大伤亡人数。这个事实是对美国帝国主义者的一个警告。
    这家报纸指出，联合国大会紧急会议通过十国提案一事表明全世界认为美国和英国的确在中东进行侵略。在这种情况下为了尽快转移世界的注意，美国和英国认为必须在世界其他部分制造紧张局势。
    缅甸“仰光日报”说
    美军驻扎在金马是侵略行动
    有影响的“仰光日报”的著名评论员吴延贡26日写道，美国有什么理由在台湾海峡驻扎它的海军部队和在金门岛派驻它的军事顾问团？评论员指出，美国的这些行动是侵略行动。
    评论员指出，口口声声说尊重人类自由和各国主权的美国人嘴里说的是一套，而实际做的又是一套。他说，美国在东亚进行了无边无际的干涉。只有美国海军撤出亚洲，取消它的军事基地，才会有和平。
    “镜报”26日的社论也谴责美国霸占台湾的侵略行为。它说，美国海军驻在台湾海峡是对中国的威胁。
    有影响的“缅甸新光报”27日发表社论说，美国这种活动纯粹是干涉中国国内事务的行为。
    这家报纸说，美国和蒋介石集团的海军即将在台湾海峡进行联合演习的行动是“对中国人民的威胁和挑衅”。
    这家报纸指出，任何国家都没有任何理由干涉中国的国内事务。但是“美国正以一支强大的军事力量在干涉着中国的内政。如果由于这种情况在这个区域爆发战争的话，那末就必须认识到，责任应由美国承担。”
    法国“解放报”说
    美国是吓不倒中国人民的
    巴黎“解放报”26日在评论中指出，目前台湾地区的紧张局势是由美蒋集团挑起的。但是中国人民是吓不倒的。
    评论说，一个月以前，蒋介石扬言要恢复对大陆的空袭。上星期又有援军开到金门和马祖。因此，中国人民解放军以大炮和空军和海军进行了长时间的猛烈的还击。
    报纸揭露了美国阴谋和恫吓，它指出，十分明显，美国今天对人民中国所进行的恶意挑衅，其目的之一就是要阻挠像法国这样的国家根本改变对中国的政策。
