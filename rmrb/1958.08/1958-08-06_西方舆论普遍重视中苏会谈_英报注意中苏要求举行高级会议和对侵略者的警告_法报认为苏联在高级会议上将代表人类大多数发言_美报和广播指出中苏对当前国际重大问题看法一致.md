Xinhua News Agency, August 5th—Since the communique of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev in Beijing was issued on the 3rd from Beijing and Moscow, by 2:00 AM on the 4th, the four major news agencies of the capitalist world—Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse—had all transmitted the full text of the communique. Among them, Associated Press transmitted it twice, and Agence France-Presse and Reuters also issued summaries of the joint communique.

Xinhua News Agency, London, August 4th—The news of the meeting between the leaders of the Chinese and Soviet governments in Beijing and the communique of this meeting are the focus of attention for British newspapers.

The London "Daily Worker" published the news with significant space and large headlines, titled: "800 Million People Demand a High-Level Meeting."

The influential London "The Times" and Glasgow's "The Scotsman" both published the full text of the communique. "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" and many other newspapers published summaries of the communique. The newspapers particularly emphasized the parts of the Mao Zedong and Khrushchev meeting communique that demanded the immediate convening of a summit meeting of the heads of government of major powers and the immediate withdrawal of American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The newspapers also paid special attention to the following passage in the communique: "If the imperialist warmongers dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples will unite closely, thoroughly eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for world peace."

"The Times," "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," and "The News Chronicle" also published editorials on the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union. The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" editorial was titled: "East Wind Blowing Strongly." This newspaper believes that this meeting is "a warning to the West."

Some newspapers (such as "The Yorkshire Post" and "The Manchester Guardian," etc.) are obviously annoyed by the great unity of the socialist camp countries and the appeal of the peace-loving foreign policies of China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, they used the news of the meeting between the leaders of the Chinese and Soviet governments as an excuse to hysterically attack and slander the Soviet Union and China.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 4th—Paris newspapers are paying attention to the Sino-Soviet meeting communique.

"Libération" commented on the communique, saying: "Beijing and Moscow's joint appeal to the peace-loving forces of the world, public support for the Middle East—all of this will make the Soviet Union, at the high-level meeting, a representative entrusted by the majority of mankind. Even if the high-level meeting does not convene, this mandate remains valid."

The bourgeois newspapers "Les Echos" and "Combat" believe that the West cannot ignore the power of the People's China. "Les Echos" particularly noted that the West is showing division at the time when China and the Soviet Union are holding talks. "Combat" said that the Sino-Soviet communique shows that the Beijing government is concerned about all issues related to Asia and Africa and the colonial movements around the world. This newspaper said that the growing force currently embodied by New China is one that only people in the U.S. State Department are trying to ignore its existence.

Paris evening newspapers also published the news of the Khrushchev and Mao Zedong meeting on prominent pages. "Le Monde" published the full text of the meeting communique and published some commentaries.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th—Washington news: Mao Zedong's meeting with Khrushchev has become the focus of attention for American public opinion. After radio stations received the news on the 3rd, they immediately canceled the morning's programs and broadcast the news to the country as a breaking news item. All newspapers published in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area on the 4th reported the event prominently on the front page.

Most newspapers publishing this news also published news photos of Mao Zedong and Khrushchev signing the joint communique.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th—TASS, New York, August 4th: American newspapers and radio stations unanimously believe that the news of the meeting between Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the People's Republic of China, is an extremely significant political event. The meeting communique shows that China and the Soviet Union hold completely consistent views on some urgent and major issues in the current international situation, and all newspapers published the communique in prominent positions.

It is worth noting that some of the earliest commentaries in New York newspapers, as usual, did not mention the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China's determination to make every effort to ease international tensions and prevent war as expressed in the communique. The newspapers also ignored the primary task of maintaining and consolidating peace put forward in the communique. The newspapers believe that the meeting of the leaders of the two major countries is related to the convening of a summit meeting to discuss the Middle East issue. Newspaper commentators' speculations on this issue vary.

    西方舆论普遍重视中苏会谈
    英报注意中苏要求举行高级会议和对侵略者的警告
    法报认为苏联在高级会议上将代表人类大多数发言
    美报和广播指出中苏对当前国际重大问题看法一致
    新华社5日讯　毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫在北京举行会谈的公报3日从北京和莫斯科发出后，到4日清晨二时止，资本主义世界的四大通讯社——美联社、合众国际社、路透社、法新社——都转播了这一公报的全文。其中美联社转播了两次，法新社和路透社还分别播发了联合公报的摘要。
    新华社伦敦4日电　中苏两国政府领导人在北京会晤的消息和这次会晤的公报是英国报纸的注意中心。
    伦敦“工人日报”以显著篇幅和大字标题刊载了这个消息，标题是：“八亿人民要求召开高级会议”。
    有影响的伦敦“泰晤士报”和格拉斯哥的“苏格兰人报”都刊载了公报全文。“每日电讯与晨邮报”和其他许多报纸发表了公报的摘要。报纸特别强调毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报中关于要求立即召开大国政府首脑会议和要求美英两国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军的部分。报纸还特别注意公报中这段话：“如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界和平。”
    “泰晤士报”、“每日电讯与晨邮报”和“新闻纪事报”还就中苏两国领导人的这次会晤发表了社论。“每日电讯与晨邮报”社论的标题是：“东风猛吹”。这家报纸认为，这次会谈是“对西方的警告”。
    有些报纸（例如“约克郡邮报”和“曼彻斯特卫报”等）显然对社会主义阵营国家的伟大团结和中苏两国爱好和平的外交政策的吸引力感到恼怒，因此它们利用中苏两国政府领导人会晤的消息作为它们歇斯底里地对苏联和中国进行攻击和诽谤的借口。
    新华社巴黎4日电　巴黎报纸注意中苏会谈公报。
    “解放报”在评论这个公报时说：“北京和莫斯科向全世界爱好和平力量的联合呼吁，公众对中近东的支持——这一切将使苏联在高级会议上成为受人类的大多数委托的代表。即使高级会议不召开，这种委托仍然有效。”
    资产阶级报纸“回声报”和“战斗报”认为，西方不能忽视人民中国的强大。“回声报”特别注意到，在中苏举行会谈的时候，西方正在呈现出分裂。“战斗报”说，中苏公报说明：北京政府关心有关亚洲和非洲的一切问题以及世界各地的殖民主义动向。这家报纸说，目前由新中国所体现的这支成长中的力量，只有美国国务院人士才试图无视它的存在。
    巴黎各晚报也以显著版面刊登了赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东会谈的消息。“世界报”刊登了这次会谈公报的全文，并且刊登了一些评论。
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：毛泽东同赫鲁晓夫的会谈成为美国舆论界当前注意的中心。广播电台在3日收听到这个消息以后，立刻撤销当天早晨的节目，把这个消息作为临时消息向全国广播。华盛顿、巴尔的摩、费拉特尔费亚和旧金山湾地区4日出版的所有报纸都在头版以显著地位报道了这件事。
    大多数发表这一消息的报纸还同时刊用了毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫在联合公报上签字时的新闻照片。
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社纽约4日讯：美国报纸和广播电台一致认为，苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和中国共产党中央委员会主席、中华人民共和国主席毛泽东会谈的消息是极其重大的政治事件。会谈公报表明，中苏两国对当前国际局势中一些迫切重大问题的看法是完全一致的，各报都在显著地位刊载了这个公报。
    值得注意的是，纽约报纸最早的一些评论照例只字不提公报中所表示的苏联和中华人民共和国决心尽一切努力来缓和国际紧张局势和防止战争这一点。报纸还忽视了公报中所提出的维护和巩固和平的首要任务。报纸认为，两大国领导人的会谈同召开政府首脑会议来讨论中近东问题这件事有关。各报评论员对这个问题的推测各不相同。
