　　Preparing Winter "Canned Food" for Livestock
    Silage Everything Possible
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In order to adapt to the new situation of the leaping development of animal husbandry, and to ensure that livestock enter the winter in good condition, the Ministry of Agriculture held a national on-the-spot silage meeting in Sanhe County, Hebei Province, from August 15th to 22nd, proposing that before this year's autumn harvest, at least 4,000 catties of silage should be prepared for each head of large livestock, and 2,000 catties for each pig.
    The meeting held that the silage period is precisely the tense season of the Three Autumns (autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn plowing), and silage is also a very urgent task. Therefore, in order to ensure that autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn plowing, and silage are not delayed, on the one hand, it is necessary to establish certain shock teams to carry out shock activities, "People add one night's work, livestock enjoy half a year's blessing"; on the other hand, it is also necessary to rationally arrange labor, fully mobilize the masses to create and promote new silage and cellar-digging tools, so as to realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of silage work, improve labor efficiency, and save manpower. The meeting particularly pointed out that the experience of Sanhe County in organizing youth, women, teenagers, and the elderly to participate in silage work is worth universal promotion. This county has already built many "Youth Cellars," "March 8th Cellars," "Young Pioneer Cellars," and "Huang Zhong Cellars," and has already silaged a large amount of feed.
    At the meeting, Cai Ziwei, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, pointed out in his summary report that all localities should immediately launch a widespread, mass-based silage movement, silage everything possible, fundamentally change the situation of insufficient livestock feed, achieve "evergreen in all seasons, enter the winter in good condition," "one year of silage, many years of use," and "people have surplus grain, livestock have surplus grass," so as to lay a solid material foundation for the socialist animal husbandry cause.
    During the meeting, representatives from various regions learned the method of coarsely producing chlortetracycline feed at the Gaogezhuang Agricultural Cooperative.

　　给牲畜准备过冬“罐头”
    把能够青贮的东西全部青贮起来
    据新华社讯　为了适应畜牧业飞跃发展的新局面，保证牲畜满膘过冬，农业部于8月15日到22日在河北省三河县召开的全国玉米秸青贮现场会议提出：在今年秋收以前，至少要给每头大牲畜青贮四千斤以上，每头猪两千斤以上的饲料。
    会议认为，青贮时期正是三秋紧张季节，而青贮饲料又是一项时间非常紧迫的任务，因此，为了做到秋收、秋播、秋耕、青贮四不误，一方面要建立一定的突击组织，开展突击活动，“人加一夜工，畜享半年福”；另一方面还必须合理安排劳动力，充分发动群众创制和推广新的青贮、挖窖工具，使青贮工作实现半机械化和机械化，提高劳动效率，节省人力。会议特别指出，三河县组织青年、妇女、少年、老人参加青贮工作的经验值得普遍推广。这个县，目前已经打了很多的“青年窖”、“三八窖”、“红领巾窖”、“黄忠窖”，并且已经青贮了大量的饲料。
    会上，农业部蔡子伟副部长在总结报告中指出，各地应立即掀起一个广泛的、群众性的青贮运动，把能够青贮的东西全部青贮起来，根本改变牲畜饲料不足的情况，做到“四季长青，满膘过冬”、“一年贮，多年用”、“人有余粮，畜有余草”，为社会主义畜牧事业奠定雄厚的物质基础。
    会议期间各地代表在高各庄农业社学习粗制金霉素饲料的方法。
