Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Washington dispatch via TASS on August 7th: U.S. Democratic Senator Fulbright delivered a speech in the Senate on the 6th entitled "On the Edge of Disaster," sharply criticizing U.S. foreign policy and calling for a fundamental change in this policy.

Fulbright said: "If we analyze the causes of the current Near East crisis, we will find that this crisis is only a symptom of a more serious disease. The fact is this: our foreign policy is unfounded, outdated, and misdirected. This policy is based partly on an incorrect understanding of our real and long-term national interests, and partly on a misjudgment of the world situation in which we live..."

Fulbright believes that the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite shows that "in another part of the world, it has become possible to achieve greater achievements in knowledge, science, and technology," thereby breaking the basic premise on which U.S. defense was based after World War II, namely, that the United States could maintain great scientific and technological superiority. He said, "The launch of the first satellite has pushed us to face reality."

Fulbright then pointed out that events in Latin America a few weeks ago showed that the United States' position in the world is unstable. He said, "In this region, which we consider more 'secure' than anywhere else, a symbolic explosion has occurred, which is no less significant than the launch of the first satellite in terms of its greatest impact on our country. A few years ago, Latin America welcomed the former Vice President almost ecstatically. Now, they spurn our current Vice President and throw stones at him. This also shows how far we have fallen."

Fulbright continued: "For many years, we have chosen the easy path. If something bad happens, whether in China or Nigeria, we always have a ready answer: the Soviet Union is behind it. What a convenient formula for evading reality, and I say, what a useless formula. If there is one factor that more than any other has determined the unfortunate situation we are in now, it is our constant attempt to use the shadow of Soviet communism to cover up the untenable aspects of our own leadership."

Fulbright called on senators to remove the blinders and abandon the comforting argument that "the Soviet Union is the sole cause of our unhappiness." He called on senators to clearly see the "position" and "role" the United States has played in the world since the end of World War II. He pointed out that now, "when the whole world is keen on fundamental reform," the United States "has become an obstacle to the path of reform in the eyes of the world." Referring to the disastrous defeat suffered by the United States in China, Fulbright believed that this "dangerous intention to cling to the status quo" was related to the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He said that, contrary to the views of some people in the United States, he believed that "the most unfortunate aspect of the United States' policy towards China" was not that the United States "did not provide (the Chiang Kai-shek clique) with sufficient military assistance and other assistance when necessary," but "on the contrary, because we attempted to maintain the status quo in China, we gave too much assistance and had too much contact with the government that could not reflect the desire for change of its own people."

Fulbright pointed out that the situation in China has become a "constant precedent that has been almost consistently cited" when the United States has subsequently intervened in the internal affairs of other countries in the world. He said, "Often, when people in other parts of the world try to seek the right to oppose an unbearable status quo, the impression created is that we support those who resist establishing these rights. Often, we oppose those who are trying to combat tyranny and corruption. In this way, we support landlords who exploit peasants and militarists who conscript people into the army."

Fulbright criticized the U.S. government for "supplying the people of underdeveloped countries with large quantities of weapons of destructive war, but providing them with few weapons to eliminate poverty, economic evils, and internal weaknesses in these countries." He said, "Look at what happened in Iraq. The Iraqi army took our weapons and drove out the government that we considered the most loyal, friendly, and reliable to the West in the Arab countries."

Fulbright's speech concluded with some specific suggestions for resolving the situation in the Middle East and Far East.

He said, "I know that unless we fundamentally and resolutely change our foreign policy, we will encounter much more serious troubles than we are facing now."

He advocated "a policy of neutralization in the Middle East," guaranteed by all parties concerned, and a halt to the supply of weapons to the region. He also believed that the "value of the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine" must be "reconsidered."

He finally asked, "What should we do in the Far East? ... What policy should we adopt? We cannot forever ignore the 600 million people on mainland China. But what should we do to establish good relations with them?"

Dulles' notorious "brink of war" policy is: the situation must be kept very tense, and the disputes must be kept boiling, until the long-awaited moment when Russia collapses on its own arrives. ... If he attends high-level meetings, he will sow the seeds of future disputes rather than resolve the current ones. ... Because he has lost confidence in the peaceful competition.
        -- Editorial in the American magazine "Survival"

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, New York dispatch: The newly launched publication "Survival" published an editorial on August 6th, fiercely criticizing Dulles' notorious "brink of war" policy.

The editorial said that now, as before, his (Dulles') declared policy opinions are inseparable from his idea from beginning to end: the situation must be kept very tense, and the disputes must be kept boiling, until the long-awaited moment when Russia collapses on its own arrives. He has never seriously abandoned his self-proclaimed reliance on "maintaining the brink."

The editorial continued, "Dulles' performance as a negotiator is consistent with his theory. It is generally – and fairly – believed that the Stassen disarmament negotiations were sabotaged by him. Equally famous is his skill in finding reasons to make a ban on nuclear testing impossible to reach an agreement, or to make a dangerous arms race impossible to ease. If he sits down with Khrushchev directly or through the President to negotiate, it is believable that he will definitely put forward his famous mass of sophistry and arbitrary distortion of the actual situation at the meeting, with the purpose of sowing the seeds of future disputes rather than resolving the current ones."

The publication said, "It is convenient to attribute all kinds of difficulties to the Russian leaders. No matter how justified it is to do so at other times, it is inappropriate in the present situation. It is our Marine Corps and our nuclear-armed fleet that are going to the world's powder keg. It is also Dulles who has shown so little confidence in his country's ability to conduct peaceful competition that he must place his hope entirely on weapons and the brink of war policy."

The publication believes that "if we want to resolve the dangerous situation and restore the prestige of the United States, there is no other way but for John Foster Dulles to leave the cabinet – and leave the position where he can influence policy in any way. Everyone knows this – many highly respected Americans, including bipartisan senators and the conservative Walter Lippmann, have said this in the past. But now, in a crisis atmosphere that suppresses the freedom of speech we are supposed to enjoy, no one is saying this anymore."

The publication concluded, "Of course, Mr. Dulles' departure is far from solving all the problems. Undoubtedly, his spirit will continue to haunt the government. However, this will be the beginning of the end of the diplomatic ice age – an indispensable first step."

    美参议员富布赖特抨击美外交政策说
    美国成了世界走向改革的障碍
    他说，美国支持的是剥削农民的地主和拉人民当兵的军国主义者；反对的是那些竭力想打击暴政和腐败的人。
    新华社8日讯  据塔斯社华盛顿7日电：美国民主党参议员富布赖特6日在参议院发表了题为“在灾难的边缘”的演说，尖锐抨击了美国的外交政策并且要求根本改变这种政策。
    富布赖特说：“如果我们分析一下产生目前近东危机的原因，我们就会发现，这个危机仅仅是更严重的疾病的征兆。事实是这样的：我国的外交政策是没有基础的，它已经过时了并且方向错误。这种政策一部分是基于对我们现实的和长远的民族利益的不正确理解，一部分则基于对我们所生活的世界局势的错误估计……”
    富布赖特认为苏联发射第一个地球人造卫星的事件表明，“在世界另一个地方已有可能在知识、科学和技术方面取得更大的成就”，从而打破了第二次世界大战后美国国防所依据的基本前提，即美国能够保持极大的科学和技术上的优越性。他说，“第一个卫星的发射推动我们去正视现实”。
    富布赖特接着指出：几个礼拜以前拉丁美洲发生的一些事件，说明美国在世界上的地位是不稳定的。他说，“在这个我们认为比所有其他地方都‘保险’的地区发生了象征性的爆发，就其对我国最巨大的影响来看并不亚于第一个卫星的发射。几年以前，拉丁美洲曾几乎是狂喜地欢迎过前副总统。而现在却唾弃我们的现任副总统并向他投掷石头。这也说明，我们下跌得多么厉害。”
    富布赖特接着说：“许多年来，我们一直选择容易的道路。如果有什么不好的事情发生，不管发生在中国还是尼日利亚，我们总是有一个现成的回答：是苏联在背后操纵。这是多么方便的回避现实的公式，而我却说，这是多么无益的公式。如果说，有一个比所有因素更能决定我们现在所处的不幸的境遇的话，那么这个因素就是我们总想利用苏联的共产主义阴影来掩盖我们本身领导中站不住脚的地方。”
    富布赖特要求参议员们除掉障眼物，放弃所谓“苏联是我们不愉快的唯一的原因”这种聊以自慰的论调。他要求参议员们看清楚第二次大战结束后美国在世界上“所处的地位”和所扮演的“角色”。他指出，现在，“当全世界都热中于根本改革的时候”，美国“在全世界面前成为改革道路上的障碍”。在谈到美国在中国遭到的惨败时富布赖特认为“这种紧紧抓住现状不放的危险意图”同蒋介石集团的崩溃有关。他说，同美国国内某些人士的看法相反，他认为“美国对中国政策中最不幸的地方”并不是美国“没有在必要时给予（蒋介石集团）足够的军事援助和其他各种援助”，而是“恰恰相反，我们由于企图保持中国的现状，对那个不能反应本国人民渴望变革的政府给予了太多的援助，有了太多的联系。”
    富布赖特指出，中国的情况已经成了嗣后美国在世界上干涉其他国家内政时“几乎一贯援引的始终不变的先例”。他说，“往往是，当世界其他地区的人民力图求得反对难以忍受的现状的权利时，造成的印象便是，我们支持那些抗拒确立这些权利的人。经常是，我们反对那些竭力想打击暴政和腐败的人。这样一来，我们就支持了那些剥削农民的地主和那些拉人民当兵的军国主义者。”
    富布赖特抨击美国政府“把破坏性战争的武器大量供给不发达国家的人民，却很少供给他们消灭这些国家中的贫困、经济恶果和内部弱点的武器”。他说，“请看，究竟伊拉克发生了什么。伊拉克军队拿到我们的武器赶走了我们认为是在阿拉伯国家中最忠于西方的、最友好的和最可靠的政府”。
    富布赖特的发言中最后还提出了关于解决中近东和远东局势的某些具体建议。
    他说，“我知道，如果不彻底坚决地改变我们的外交政策，我们将碰到比现在更加严重得多的麻烦”。
    他主张“在中近东实行中立化政策”，由有关各方加以保证，并且停止向这个地区供应武器。他还认为必须“重新考虑巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义的价值”。
    他最后问道，“我们在远东怎么办？……我们采取什么政策？我们不能永远无视中国大陆上的六亿人民。但是为了要同他们建立良好的关系，我们该做些什么呢？”
    杜勒斯的臭名远扬的“战争边缘”政策就是：局势必须保持得很紧张，纠纷必须保持沸腾状态，一直到俄国自行“垮台”的那个渴望已久的时刻到来。……如果参加高级会议，他会散播未来纠纷的种子而不是解决目前的纠纷。……因为他失去了对和平竞赛的信心。
        ——美国“生存”杂志的社论
    新华社8日讯  纽约消息：最近新创刊的刊物“生存”8月6日发表社论，猛烈抨击杜勒斯的臭名远扬的“战争边缘”政策。
    社论说，现在和从前一样，他（杜勒斯）所宣布的政策上的意见从头至尾都离不开他的这样的想法：局势必须保持得很紧张，纠纷必须保持沸腾状态，一直到俄国自行“垮台”的那个渴望已久的时刻到来。他从来没有当真地放弃过他自吹的对“保持边缘状态”的信赖。
    社论接着说，“杜勒斯作为一个谈判代表的表现同他的理论是一致的。大家普遍地——也是公正地——认为史塔生裁军谈判是他破坏的。同样出名的是他善于寻找理由使得禁止核试验问题不可能达成协议，或者使得危险的军备竞赛不可能有所缓和。如果他直接地或者通过总统坐下来同赫鲁晓夫谈判，可以相信他一定会在会上提出他的著名的大量诡辩和对实际情况进行随意的歪曲，目的是要散播未来纠纷的种子而不是解决目前的纠纷。”
    这家刊物说，“把各种困难都归过于俄国领袖，是很方便的事。不管在别的时候这样做是多么有理由，在目前情况下这是不恰当的。开到世界火药库去的是我国的海军陆战队和我国的有核武器装备的舰队。也正是杜勒斯表现出他对自己国家进行和平竞赛的能力这么没有信心，以致于他必须把希望完全寄托在武器和战争边缘政策上面。”
    这家刊物认为，“如果要解决危险局势和恢复美国的威望，除了约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯脱离内阁——而且脱离对政策可以发生任何影响的地位——之外没有别的办法。人人都知道这一点——许多极受尊敬的美国人，包括两党参议员和保守的华尔特·李普曼，过去都说过这话。但是现在在一种使我们被认为享有的言论自由受到压抑的危机气氛中，没有人再说这话了。”
    刊物最后说，“当然，杜勒斯先生下台远不是一切问题都解决了。无疑他的精神还会继续笼罩着政府。但是，这将是结束外交方面的冰河时代的一个开端——不可缺少的第一步。”
