People's Daily, Xushui, 17th - What to do with too much grain? When Chairman Mao inspected Xushui County, Hebei Province, he reminded the leading cadres of the county party committee to consider this issue. Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, the Xushui County Party Committee conducted a serious study and discussion on this issue. They have two solutions: one is to do everything possible to harvest and process sweet potatoes well, and gradually abolish grain rationing in rural canteens; the other is to uniformly arrange next year's grain production, expand the wheat planting area, and improve the quality of grain for the people.

Xushui County had a bumper wheat harvest this year, and the autumn crops are currently growing very well. Efforts are being made to achieve a yield of 2,000 jin per mu, and the total grain output of the county for the whole year will reach 1.4 billion jin, an increase of about tenfold compared to last year. With a population of 320,000 in the county, each person will have an average of more than 4,000 jin of grain. The county party committee believes that the conditions are already in place to abolish grain rationing for farmers. This year, the sweet potato planting area in the county reached more than 350,000 mu, accounting for more than half of the grain planting area. The sweet potato yield this year will reach 4.4 billion jin, equivalent to 1.1 billion jin of grain. Therefore, the first thing to do is to harvest and store the sweet potatoes well, and do a good job in processing and utilizing them. The county party committee decided to use deep plows to dig up the sweet potatoes in the autumn, which will both turn the land and speed up the sweet potato harvesting work. In addition to keeping a portion for consumption, most of the harvested sweet potatoes will be sliced, dried, and used to make starch, white sugar, and wine, and to extract alcohol and synthetic rubber.

The county is preparing to build alcohol factories and sugar factories, and each commune will also establish small distilleries and flour mills to fully utilize sweet potatoes. This autumn, Xushui County's rural areas will first implement "to each according to his needs" for sweet potatoes. For example, commune members can bake a few sweet potatoes to eat when burning stoves in winter. In addition, Xushui County will also use sweet potatoes to greatly develop pig production. The number of pigs will increase from the current 90,000 to 1.6 million next year, greatly increasing the supply of meat.

Based on this year's grain production, the Xushui County Party Committee has made preliminary arrangements for next year's agricultural production. Next year, the grain planting area will be slightly reduced in order to vigorously increase the yield per unit area. To improve grain quality, the wheat planting area will be expanded from 350,000 mu this year to 500,000 mu, and the sweet potato planting area will be reduced from 350,000 mu to about 200,000 mu. The wheat yield target is to reach 1,000 jin per mu, with an average of 1,600 jin of wheat per person. In addition, 30,000 mu of oil crops, 100,000 mu of sugar beets and sugar radishes, and 120,000 mu of cash crops such as cotton and hemp will be planted to meet the diverse needs of people's lives. To achieve this requirement, the wheat fields will be generally deep-plowed to a depth of more than 1.2 chi this year, and more than 150,000 jin of base fertilizer will be applied. All will be densely planted, and the sowing amount will be increased from 15 or 16 jin last year to about 50 jin. We are now actively reforming deep plowing tools and carrying out a manure accumulation campaign to speed up wheat planting preparations. (Hu Shu, Chen Bowei)

### 徐水县根据毛主席的指示提出粮食多了的解决办法

    徐水县根据毛主席的指示提出粮食多了的解决办法
    本报徐水17日电　粮食多了怎么办？毛主席到河北省徐水县视察的时候，曾经提醒县委领导干部要考虑这个问题。徐水县委根据毛主席的指示，对这个问题做了认真的研究和讨论。他们的办法有两个：一个是千方百计做好甘薯的收获和加工利用，并逐渐取消农村食堂的粮食定量限制；一个是统一安排明年的粮食生产，扩大小麦种植面积，提高人民的用粮质量。
    徐水县今年小麦丰收，目前秋熟作物生长很好，争取亩产二千斤，全县全年粮食总产量将达到十四亿斤，比去年增产十倍左右。全县三十二万人，平均每人将有四千多斤粮食。县委认为取消农民吃粮的定量限制，已经具备了条件。今年全县甘薯种植面积达到三十五万多亩，占粮食种植面积的一半还多，今年甘薯产量将达四十四亿斤，折合粮食十一亿斤。因此首先需要把甘薯收好藏好，并做好加工利用。县委决定秋天用深耕犁来挖薯，这样既翻了地又加快了甘薯收获工作。收下的大量甘薯，除留一部食用外，大部分将切片晒干，制造淀粉、白糖和酿酒，提炼酒精和人造橡胶。
    县里正在筹建酒精厂、制糖厂，每个公社也将普遍建立小型烧锅和粉坊，充分利用甘薯。今年秋后，徐水县农村将首先在甘薯上实行“各取所需”，比如社员们冬天烧炉子就可以烤几块甘薯来吃。此外徐水县还将利用甘薯大量发展生猪生产。明年生猪头数将由现在的九万头增加到一百六十万头，大量增加肉类供应。
    根据今年粮食生产情况，徐水县委对明年的农业生产做了初步安排。明年将略为缩小粮食种植面积，以便大力提高单位面积产量。为提高粮食质量，明年小麦种植面积将由今年的三十五万亩扩大到五十万亩，甘薯将由三十五万亩压缩到二十万亩左右。小麦产量指标要求达到亩产一千斤，平均每人有一千六百斤小麦。此外还要种植油料作物三万亩，甜菜、糖萝卜等十万亩，棉麻等经济作物十二万亩，以满足人民生活多方面的需要。为了实现这个要求，今年麦地将普遍深翻一尺二寸以上，施底肥十五万斤以上，全部采用密植，播种量由去年的十五、六斤增加到五十斤左右。现在正积极进行深翻工具的改革，并开展积肥运动，加紧种麦准备。　（胡曙、陈勃伟）
