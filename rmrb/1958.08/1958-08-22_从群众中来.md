　　From the Masses
    Improve Newspaper and Magazine Distribution
    It is very difficult to read newspapers and magazines here. For a long time, the local post office has only delivered newspapers and magazines such as the People's Daily from the beginning of the month in the second half of the month or even at the end of the month. This phenomenon has not changed in today's Great Leap Forward. This is really not right!

    Our farm is only twenty *hua li* away from Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province. However, it takes seven or eight days for our subscribed newspapers and magazines and letters to be delivered after they arrive at the Hegang City Post and Telecommunications Bureau. The reason is that the postman of this post office comes only once every seven or eight days. We have made suggestions to the post office many times, but they have not improved.

    The newspapers subscribed to by our farm are not delivered by the local post office every day, but every few days. A large pile is delivered at once, and we can't finish reading them in one day. I hope the post office will deliver the newspapers in a timely manner.

    Why Collect Money and Not Deliver Goods?
    In August last year, we ordered a set of fire-fighting universal gearboxes, water inlet gates and other equipment from Wuhan Fire-fighting Machinery Factory. We paid the full amount of the goods at the time of ordering, and they promised to ship the goods immediately. But it has been a year now, and the goods have not been shipped yet. We have repeatedly sent letters to urge them, but to no avail.

　　从群众中来
    改进报刊发行工作
    我们这里阅读报刊非常困难，长期以来，当地邮局都是在下半月甚至月末，才把月初的人民日报等报刊送来。这种现象，在大跃进的今天还没有改变。这实在不应该！
　　　　    黑龙江省饶河县国营859农场  赵洪文
    我们农场离黑龙江省鹤岗市仅二十华里。可是，我们订阅的报刊以及信件到鹤岗市邮电局以后，要过七、八天才能送来。原因是这个邮局的邮递员每隔七、八天才来一次。我们向邮局提了多少次意见，他们也不改进。
　　　　    黑龙江省鹤立河农场全体人员
    我们场里订的报纸，当地邮局不是每天送来，而是隔几天才送一次。一次送来一大堆，一天也看不完。希望邮局及时送报。

    为什么收钱不发货？
    去年8月间，我们向武汉市消防机器厂订购了一套消防万能变速箱、进水闸门等器材。订货当时就交足了货款，他们答应立即发货。可是到现在已过了一年，还没有把货发来。我们多次去信催促，也未见效。
