Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Rio de Janeiro: Machado Neto, President of the Brazilian National Confederation of Commerce, expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions the United States insisted on when granting loans to Brazil. It is believed that Neto's dissatisfaction represents not only his personal opinion but also reflects the sentiments of people in Brazilian economic circles and some officials.

Neto said he was "disappointed" with the speech delivered by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles during his recent visit to Brazil. In his speech, Dulles described the intrusion of American capital into Brazil as "a great contribution to Brazil's development" and emphasized that Brazil had received more loans from the United States than any other country in the world.

Neto pointed out that Dulles's hypocritical statement was irrelevant. He retorted, are these loans a favor, or, on the contrary, are they a transaction with solid guarantees plus the Brazilian government's collateral?

Xinhua News Agency, London, 18th dispatch: An editorial in the Argentine newspaper "El Tiempo" on August 14, commenting on Dulles's recent trip to Brazil, stated that the U.S. Secretary of State went to Brazil to "execute the U.S. imperialism's war-mongering plan."

The newspaper said that he is trying to involve the governments of Latin American countries in the whirlpool of the U.S.'s "aggression" policy and to gain support from more Latin American countries in the United Nations General Assembly.

The newspaper also revealed that another purpose of "international conspiracy veteran" Dulles's trip to Brazil was to create mistrust among Latin American countries.

Speaking of the recent relations between Argentina and Chile, "El Tiempo" said that only American and British imperialism could benefit from the tension. These two imperialist countries are stirring up trouble in every way, and they clearly hope to create restraining centers in Latin American countries. The newspaper said: "The United States will try to 'mediate' any conflict in Latin American countries through itself and through the Organization of American States in order to obtain its own huge benefits from this mediation."

The newspaper pointed out that any dispute between Argentina and Chile "can be resolved through peaceful negotiations." Further unity and consensus between Argentina and Chile are in line with the true national and democratic interests of both countries.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Buenos Aires: The governments of Argentina and Chile issued a joint statement on the 17th in their respective capitals, stating that the two countries have resolved the conflict caused by the Argentine Navy's occupation of Snipe Island.

Snipe Island is located near Cape Horn, the southernmost tip of Latin America. In January of this year, Chile built a lighthouse there. On August 9, an Argentine destroyer destroyed the lighthouse, and Argentine troops later occupied the island, thus causing a dispute between the two countries over the island's sovereignty.

The joint statement pointed out that the two governments have agreed that the Argentine Navy will withdraw from Snipe Island and resolve the issue of the island's sovereignty peacefully.

    拉丁美洲公众仇美情绪日益强烈
　　巴西商会主席抨击美国贷款是假恩假惠
　  阿根廷报纸斥责杜勒斯进行挑拨的勾当
    新华社19日讯  里约热内卢消息：巴西全国商业联合会主席马沙多·奈托对于美国在贷款给巴西时硬要巴西接受的条件表示不满。人们认为，奈托的不满不只代表他个人的意见，而且反映了巴西经济界人士和某些官方人士的情绪。
    奈托说，他对美国国务卿杜勒斯不久以前访问巴西时所发表的演说感到“失望”。杜勒斯在演说中曾经把美国资本侵入巴西说成是“对巴西发展的一个很大的贡献”，并且强调巴西从美国获得的贷款比世界上任何其他国家都要多。
    奈托就杜勒斯的这种虚伪的说法指出，这是文不对题的。他反问道，这些贷款到底是一种恩惠呢，还是刚刚相反，而是附有坚实的保证加上巴西政府的担保的一笔交易呢？
    新华社伦敦18日电  阿根廷报纸“时报”8月14日的社论在评论杜勒斯最近巴西之行时说，美国国务卿所以要到巴西去，是为了“执行美帝国主义的好战计划”。
    这家报纸说，他正在设法使拉丁美洲国家政府卷入美国的“侵略”政策的漩涡，并且使它自己在联合国大会获得拉丁美洲更多国家的支持。
    这家报纸还揭露说，“国际阴谋老手”杜勒斯巴西之行的另一个目的是制造拉丁美洲国家之间的不信任。
    “时报”在谈到阿根廷和智利之间最近的关系时说，只有美英帝国主义才能从紧张局势中得到好处。这两个帝国主义国家从各个方面进行煽动，它们显然希望在拉丁美洲国家制造牵制性的中心。报纸说：“美国将设法通过它自己并且通过美洲国家组织来‘调停’任何拉丁美洲国家的冲突，以便从这种调解中取得它自己的巨大利益。”
    这家报纸指出，阿根廷和智利之间的任何纠纷“能够通过和平谈判来解决”。阿根廷和智利进一步的团结和一致符合两国真正的民族民主利益。
    新华社19日讯  布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷和智利两国政府17日分别在两国首都发表联合声明，声明指出，两国已经解决了由于阿根廷海军占领斯奈普岛而引起的冲突。
    斯奈普岛在拉丁美洲最南端的合恩角附近。今年1月，智利在那里建立了一座灯塔。8月9日，阿根廷的一艘驱逐舰毁坏了这座灯塔，阿根廷军队并且在后来占领了这个小岛，因此引起了两国对这个岛屿主权的争执。
    联合声明指出，两国政府已经商妥，阿根廷海军撤离斯奈普岛，并且用和平方式解决这个岛的主权问题。
