　　Modern Revisionists Fear the Voice of Truth
    Yugoslav "Borba" Shamelessly Tampered with the Sino-Soviet Communiqué
    Deleting All Paragraphs Condemning Imperialist Aggression
Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: The Yugoslav League of Communists' newspaper "Borba" published a simple summary of the communiqué of the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in Beijing on August 4th, after making alterations with ulterior motives. The attitude of this newspaper towards the communiqué once again exposes the ugly face of the Yugoslav modern revisionists.

    The meeting between the Chinese and Soviet leaders is of great significance for the current struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and oppose aggression, and has been universally valued and supported by the people of socialist countries and peace-loving countries. Newspapers and periodicals in these countries have published the full text or detailed summaries of the communiqué in prominent positions. However, "Borba" has tried its best to dilute the significance of the Sino-Soviet meeting, and the summary news of the communiqué it published is only about a quarter of the full text. This newspaper has deliberately deleted most of the main content of the communiqué. Another Yugoslav newspaper, "Politika," published about one-third less content of the communiqué than "Borba."

    "Borba" attempts to belittle the solemn propositions put forward by China and the Soviet Union for defending world peace, opposing the imperialist policy of aggression, and supporting national independence movements, and to belittle the significant achievements made by the two countries in this regard. It intentionally deleted entire sentences and paragraphs from the communiqué related to these aspects. For example, it completely deleted the paragraph in the communiqué stating that the peace policy of China and the Soviet Union has received increasingly widespread sympathy and support from the people of all countries in the world, and that China and the Soviet Union will do everything possible to continue to work to ease international tensions and prevent new war disasters. It also deleted the paragraph in the communiqué regarding the role of India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, and other Asian, African, American, and European countries and peoples advocating peaceful coexistence in consolidating peace. Even the sentence "The forces of peace have grown unprecedentedly" was also deleted. "Borba" also completely deleted the paragraph in the communiqué regarding China and the Soviet Union's firm support for the national independence movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and condemnation of colonialism.

    In order to please imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, this newspaper even deleted all the words and paragraphs in the communiqué that severely condemned the imperialist aggressive blocs for intensifying tensions, obstructing summit conferences, establishing aggressive military-political blocs and military bases, and rudely interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. It changed "the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by U.S. monopoly groups" mentioned in the communiqué to "Western countries," and also deleted the words in the communiqué about the armed aggression and military threats of the United States and Britain against Arab countries.

    "Borba" also deleted all the last five paragraphs of the communiqué. It deleted the solemn warning of the communiqué to the imperialist warmongers, and also completely deleted all content in the communiqué involving the fraternal friendship, firm unity, comprehensive cooperation and mutual assistance between the governments, parties, and peoples of China and the Soviet Union, as well as the great significance of this unity and cooperation for the development of the two countries' construction and the strengthening of the socialist camp. When talking about the discussion and assessment of various major issues by the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, it also deliberately deleted the words "achieved complete agreement" and "reached complete agreement."

    "Borba" did not dare to report to the Yugoslav people that the Communist Parties of China and the Soviet Union expressed their determination to wage an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism, the main danger in the communist movement. It changed this paragraph in the communiqué to the communiqué "talked about the struggle against revisionism." However, it used such a provocative subtitle when publishing the summary news of the communiqué: "Attacks Yugoslavia in the Communiqué."

　　现代修正主义者害怕真理的声音
    南“战斗报”无耻篡改中苏会谈公报
    居然把谴责帝国主义侵略的段落删得一干二净
    新华社20日讯  南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟机关报“战斗报”8月4日经过别有用心的删改以后，刊登了毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志北京会谈公报的简单摘要。这家报纸对会谈公报所采取的态度，再一次暴露了南斯拉夫现代修正主义者的嘴脸。
    中苏领导人的会谈对于目前全世界人民保卫和平、反对侵略的斗争具有伟大的意义，受到了社会主义国家和爱好和平国家人民的普遍重视和拥护。这些国家的报刊都用显著地位刊登了会谈公报的全文或详细摘要。但是，“战斗报”却竭力冲淡中苏会谈的意义，它所发表的会谈公报的摘要新闻只等于公报全文的四分之一左右。这家报纸对公报中绝大部分的主要内容都别有用心地删掉了。而另一家南斯拉夫报纸“政治报”刊登公报的内容还比“战斗报”约少三分之一。
    “战斗报”力图贬低中苏两国为保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义的侵略政策、支持民族独立运动而提出的严正主张，贬低两国在这方面所取得的重大成就。它有意整句、整段地删去会谈公报中的有关这些方面的内容。例如，它完全删去了公报中关于中苏两国的和平政策得到了世界各国人民日益广泛的同情和支持、中苏两国将竭尽一切可能继续为和缓国际紧张局势、防止新的战争灾难而努力的一段话。它也删去公报中关于印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国以及其他主张和平共处的亚洲、非洲、美洲、欧洲的国家和人民对巩固和平的作用的那一段。甚至连“和平力量已经有了空前的增长”这一句话也被删除。对于会谈公报中有关中苏两国坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动、谴责殖民主义的一段，“战斗报”也完全删掉了。
    这家报纸为了讨好帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，竟把公报中所有严厉谴责帝国主义侵略集团加剧紧张局势、阻挠大国首脑会议、建立侵略性的军事政治集团和军事基地、粗暴干涉他国内政等词句和段落删得一干二净。它把公报中提到的“以美国垄断集团为首的帝国主义侵略集团”改为“西方国家”，也删去了公报中关于美英对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略和武力威胁的话。
    “战斗报”还把会谈公报中最后五段统统删掉了。它删去了公报对帝国主义战争狂人的严正警告，也完全删去了公报中所有涉及中苏两国政府、两党和两国人民之间的兄弟友好、牢固团结、全面合作和互助关系，以及这种团结和合作对两国建设的发展、对社会主义阵营力量的加强的重大意义的内容。它在谈到中苏两国领导人讨论和估计各种重大问题的时候，还有意把“取得了完全一致的意见”、“达成了完全的协议”等字句删去。
    “战斗报”不敢向南斯拉夫人民报道中苏两国共产党表示要同共产主义运动中的主要危险修正主义进行毫不调和的斗争，它把公报中的这一段改为公报“谈到反对修正主义的斗争”。但是，它却在发表会谈公报摘要新闻时用上了这样一个挑拨性的副标题：“在公报中攻击南斯拉夫”。
