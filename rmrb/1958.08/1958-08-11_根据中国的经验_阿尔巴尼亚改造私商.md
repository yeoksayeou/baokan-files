Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 10th: Albania's commercial sector is organizing and transforming private retail businesses based on China's experience. In the past month alone, more than fifty private retailers have been organized in the capital, Tirana, and joint organizations have been established in three industries: meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Private business owners participating in the joint ventures have collectively rectified their shops under the leadership of the government, unified their accounting management, and elected leaders. The commercial sector is also prepared to help them improve their business management and increase the variety of goods in order to better coordinate with state-owned businesses and meet the people's need for retail goods.

　　Before liberation, Albania's private businesses found it difficult to develop under the oppression of feudal lords and foreign capital.

　　Currently, there are only over one hundred private businesses remaining in the entire city of Tirana. Like private businesses in other regions, they all hope to receive assistance from the state and undergo transformation in order to better play their role in socialist construction. In 1946, the socialist component in Albania's domestic trade accounted for only 21%, while it currently accounts for 85%.

　　根据中国的经验
　　阿尔巴尼亚改造私商
    新华社地拉那10日电　阿尔巴尼亚商业部门正根据中国的经验对私营零售商业进行组织和改造工作。最近一个月来，仅首都地拉那组织起来的私营零售商就有五十多家，并已建立了肉品、水果、蔬菜和乳类食品等三种行业的联营组织。参加联营的私商在政府领导下集体整顿了自己的店铺，统一了账目管理并选出了领导。商业部门也准备帮助他们改善经营管理和增加商品的花色品种，以便使他们更好地配合国营商业，满足人民对零售商品的需要。
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚的私营商业在封建主和外国资本的压榨下，很难发展。
    目前，全地拉那市留存的私营商业仅有一百多家，它们像其它各地的私营商业一样，都希望能得到国家的帮助和进行改造，以便更好发挥它们在社会主义建设中的作用。1946年，在阿尔巴尼亚国内贸易中社会主义成分仅占21％，而目前已占85％。
