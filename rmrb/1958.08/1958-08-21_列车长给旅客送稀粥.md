　　Train Conductor Brings Gruel to Passengers
    Some time ago, I boarded the train from Tianjin to Sanksoshu in Siping while ill. The passengers were happily discussing the Great Leap Forward, and the train conductor and attendants came along with buckets of gruel, pickled vegetables, and bowls and chopsticks. I heard the conductor say, "Comrade Passengers! To enable those comrades who are weak to eat easily digestible food like they would at home, we have specially prepared some gruel and pickled vegetables to bring to the carriages. Each serving only costs three cents. Any comrade who wants to eat, please don't hesitate." At this time, the attendant had already walked to a frail woman and delivered the gruel and pickled vegetables to her. The conductor then came to ask me, "Comrade, would you like a bowl of gruel?" Before he could finish speaking, I excitedly stood up and shook his hand, saying, "Thank you so much." My heart has been moved by this incident more than once.

　　列车长给旅客送稀粥
    前些日子，我带着病在四平乘上了由天津开往三棵树的火车。旅客们都在愉快地谈论大跃进，列车长和列车员拿着粥桶、咸菜和碗筷走过来了。只听到列车长说：“旅客同志！我们为了使一些体弱的同志像在家里一样能够吃到一些容易消化的菜饭，特准备了一些稀粥和咸菜送到车厢里来，每份只卖三分钱。那位同志要吃，请不要客气。”这时列车员已走到一位身体瘦弱的妇女身旁，把粥和咸菜送到她面前。列车长又来问我：“同志要碗粥吗？”没等他说完，我激动地站起来握住他的手说：“真是太感谢你们了。”我的心不止一次地为这件事而感动着。  沈阳三十九中学  葛荫贤（附图片）
