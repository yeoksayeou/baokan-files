　　Launch Competition to Complement Strengths and Weaknesses

　　Hebei Province is “Learning from Henan, Catching up with Henan, Striving for the Top, Striving for First Place”; Henan Province is also “Learning from the heroic people of Hebei, and Competing with the heroic people of Hebei.”

　　During the Great Leap Forward of the motherland, Hebei and Henan provinces have both made outstanding achievements. The creative labor of the people of the two provinces has yielded countless fruitful results. However, they did not "dismount" and take a breather, but rather became even more enthusiastic, set ambitious goals, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, strive for the top, and strive for first place, and never give up until they achieve their goals. This spirit of continuous revolution, communist style, and heroic spirit is extremely valuable.

　　The achievements and experiences of the people of the two provinces will not be identical. Hebei Province may have made great achievements and good experiences in this aspect, while Henan Province may have done better in another aspect. In this way, by carrying out revolutionary friendly competition, encouraging each other, learning from each other, and complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, it will inevitably promote greater victories in all aspects of the work of the two provinces on the basis of the great victories already achieved.

　　Now, Hebei Province has launched a vigorous movement to learn from Henan and catch up with Henan; Henan Province has also formulated new combat tasks. We wish the people of the two provinces to join hands and move forward together in the competition, leaping forward again and again!

　　开展竞赛  互补短长
    河北省在“学河南，赶河南，争上游，争第一”；河南省也在“向英雄的河北人民学习，和英雄的河北人民竞赛”。
    在祖国大跃进中，河北、河南两省都做出了突出成绩。两省人民创造性的劳动，结出了无数丰硕的果实。但是，他们并没有就此“下马”松一口气，而是干劲鼓得更足，树雄心，立大志，学先进，赶先进，力争上游，力争第一，不达目的绝不罢休。这种不断革命的精神、共产主义的风格和英雄的气魄，是极为宝贵的。
    两个省的人民所取得的成就和经验不会是雷同的。河北省在这一方面成就大、经验好，而河南省在另一方面也许做得更突出。这样通过开展革命的友谊竞赛，互相激励，互相学习，互补短长，势必促使两省各方面工作在已取得巨大胜利的基础上，取得更大的胜利。
    现在，河北全省已经轰轰烈烈地展开学河南、赶河南运动；河南省也制定了新的战斗任务。我们预祝两省人民在竞赛中，共同携手向前，跃进再跃进！
