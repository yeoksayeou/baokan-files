　　黎巴嫩反对派领袖决定
　　美军不撤　战斗不休
    新华社大马士革12日电　据中东通讯社11日援引贝鲁特消息灵通人士的话说，贝鲁特、的黎波里、贝卡、舒夫和黎巴嫩南部的反对派领袖们在过去二十四小时内就黎巴嫩危机的发展和解决办法问题举行了会议和接触。
    这些人士说，反对派领袖们在会谈以后决定“准备继续斗争，直到全国从贪污时代的统治者手里完全解放出来和美国占领军撤出的时候为止”。这些人士又说，反对派领袖们一致认为，由于夏蒙政府奉行帝国主义政策，黎巴嫩目前的局势如果继续到今年9月，就会产生更多的灾难。
    这家通讯社又说，贝鲁特地区反对派领袖萨拉姆11日晚间在举行了几次会议以后说，反对派领袖还在继续进行接触中。
    据这家通讯社说，“第三力量”的亨利·法鲁恩目前正在同反对派领袖们和“一切有关方面”进行接触，以便找到解决危机的办法。法鲁恩经常担任“调解人”。这家通讯社说，法鲁恩的行动是他在11日同反对派领袖琼卜拉特会谈以后采取的。
