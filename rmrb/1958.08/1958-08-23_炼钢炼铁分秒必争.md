　　Guangdong: Technical skills, raw materials, and equipment are managed simultaneously to produce 800,000 tons of steel this year
    Shaanxi: Organize a thousand-person technical team to set off separately to stimulate local steel production
    Jiangxi: A 100,000-strong inspection army is ready to depart, advancing into the steel production front within days
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 22nd: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee convened a radio conference on the afternoon of the 20th entitled "The Entire Party and All the People are Mobilized, Working Hard for Forty Days, to Produce 270,000 Tons of Iron to Welcome National Day." At the meeting, Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Hebei Province, pointed out in his report that by August 15th, 199 small blast furnaces and more than 10,000 native furnaces had been built in the province; among them, more than 2,000 small blast furnaces and native furnaces had been put into production.
    Governor Liu emphasized that the amount of pig iron we have obtained is still not large, and the speed of mining is not fast enough. If we do not speed up, there is a danger that the annual iron production task will not be completed. Therefore, he demanded that all party comrades accelerate their pace, act quickly, and lead the broad masses to work hard for forty days to strive to complete the task of producing 270,000 tons of iron in the third quarter.
    At the conference, Su Yingming, Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward a proposal to fraternal regions across the province to "take all measures to strive for quick and increased iron production." This was unanimously echoed by the responsible comrades of the Baoding Prefectural Committee, Tangshan Prefectural Committee, Chengde Prefectural Committee, Handan Prefectural Committee, Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee, and the Tianjin Municipal Planning Commission.
    Our newspaper, Jinan, August 22nd: At the telephone conference of the first secretaries of municipal and prefectural party committees held by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on the evening of the 20th, it was requested that the first secretaries of the municipal, prefectural, and county party committees work hard for forty days with all their energy, resolutely and quickly raising the iron and steel marshal. Bai Rubing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, pointed out in his concluding speech that in order to complete the province's plan to produce 750,000 tons of pig iron and 250,000 tons of steel this year, and to fully grasp steel, we must strive to achieve an output of 200,000 tons of pig iron and 70,000 tons of steel before National Day. At the meeting, he also announced the ten decisions of the Provincial Party Committee on vigorously grasping steel production: 1. We must resolutely implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link to drive the great development of other industries." 2. Party committees at all levels must immediately strengthen their leadership over steel production, and the first secretary must immediately use all their energy to grasp steel for forty days after the meeting. 3. Strengthen the communist cooperation among regions, departments, workers, and peasants. 4. Vigorously collect scrap steel. 5. Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over iron ore mining, coking, and the production of smelting equipment. 6. All localities should immediately take effective measures to improve transportation work. 7. The built iron-smelting furnaces should be put into production as soon as possible and normalized, and continue to vigorously develop small blast furnaces and widely use substitutes for building furnaces. 8. Special zones without iron ore resources should organize considerable forces to smelt steel and iron in special zones with ore; special zones with ore should give strong support and assistance. 9. Pay attention to reducing the cost of iron smelting. 10. The use of labor should be carefully studied and comprehensively arranged.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 21st: Guangdong Province has adopted comprehensive leadership and three-pronged measures to address the main contradictions existing in the current steel industry, ensuring the completion of this year's steel production tasks.
    So far, only one-third of the built small blast furnaces have been put into production. After the provincial leading departments identified the main contradictions in the current steel production, they immediately took measures to strengthen comprehensive leadership and manage technical skills, raw materials, and equipment simultaneously to comprehensively solve these contradictions. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently dispatched seven steel inspection teams headed by Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of the province (each team has engineering and technical personnel participating), together with responsible cadres from various special zones and counties, to conduct comprehensive inspections in various places, solve problems in a timely manner, and summarize the experience of steel production.
    The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities in the province to ensure that the 4,000 blast furnaces that have been built and are about to be built will produce iron normally within half a month, and strive to overfulfill the task of producing 300,000 tons of steel and 500,000 tons of iron this year.
    Our newspaper, Xi'an, August 22nd: Six working teams composed of one thousand technicians in Shaanxi Province recently went to Hanzhong, Ankang, Shangluo, Yan'an, Yulin Special Zones and the Guanzhong area to strengthen technical guidance for newly built iron and steel industries in various places. This technical team, including geology, mining, testing and smelting, will assist the above-mentioned areas in solving technical problems in the construction and production of small blast furnaces and native blast furnaces.
    Strengthening technical guidance is an important issue in the rapid development of the steel industry in Shaanxi Province. Shaanxi Province had no steel industry in the past and lacked experience in steel industry construction and production. Therefore, it encountered many technical difficulties in the construction of the steel industry, which affected production and construction. Some of the built iron-smelting furnaces could not be put into production immediately due to the lack of smelting technical guidance; some of the 52 native iron furnaces and small blast furnaces that had been put into production were affected by operational techniques and other issues, affecting normal production.
    After a comprehensive inspection of these problems in the development of the steel industry, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to continue to strengthen the leadership at all levels, rely on the mobilization of the masses, and immediately draw technical forces from the Metallurgical Industry Bureau, Geological Bureau, Jiaotong University, Northwest University, Geological School, and other units to send them to various parts of the province.
    Our newspaper, Nanchang, August 22nd: Jiangxi Province formed a steel production inspection team on the 21st to inspect the steel industry throughout the province and promote the leap forward in steel construction.
    The inspection team is headed by Yang Shangkui, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, as the general leader, and Shao Shiping, Fang Zhichun, Liu Junxiu, and Bai Dongcai, secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee, as deputy general leaders. Members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the first secretaries and secretaries of the Party Committees of various regions and prefectures serve as the leaders and deputy leaders of the sub-teams, drawing all possible technical forces and agricultural production inspection teams to form a 100,000-strong army to inspect steel production.
    Since the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to realize a great leap forward in the steel industry in mid-June, more than 4,500 large and small blast furnaces have been built throughout the province by early August, but as of the 17th, only 20,000 tons of iron had been produced throughout the province, with a daily iron output of less than 1,000 tons. That is to say, a total of more than 4,000 native blast furnaces have been built throughout the province, of which only 470 iron furnaces are in relatively normal production, and about 90% of the iron furnaces cannot produce iron normally. The Provincial Party Committee believes that if this situation is not reversed quickly, there is a danger that the steel production task will not be completed.
    The Provincial Party Committee also pointed out that the current speed of steel production is far from the planned requirements, and the current daily output of 1,000 tons must be increased to 10,000 tons. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee decided that the steel production inspection army will enter the steel production front within days, and the agricultural production inspection team will immediately grasp steel production, take responsibility for different areas, solve problems within a time limit, and strive for a bumper harvest of both grain and steel.

　　炼钢炼铁分秒必争
　　河北：全党全民大干四十天，27万吨生铁任务一定要完成
　　山东：省委作出十项决定，今年内要生产钢铁100万吨
　　广东：技术、原料、设备三管齐下，今年生产钢铁80万吨
    陕　西：组织千人技术队伍，分头出发为地方钢铁生产催生
    江　西：十万检查大军整装待发，日内开进钢铁生产阵地
    据新华社天津22日电　中共河北省委和省人民委员会在20日下午召开“全党全民齐动员，大干四十天，拿铁二十七万吨，迎接国庆节”广播大会。会上，中共河北省委书记处书记、河北省省长刘子厚作报告指出，到8月15日止，全省已建成小高炉一百九十九座，土炉一万多座；其中投入生产的小高炉和土炉，已有两千多座。
    刘省长强调指出，当前我们拿到的生铁还不多，采矿的速度也不快，如果不快马加鞭加快速度，全年产铁的任务就有完不成的危险。因此，要求全党同志加快步伐，迅速行动，带动广大群众大干四十天，为完成第三季度产铁二十七万吨的任务而奋斗。
    在大会上，中共石家庄地委书记处书记苏应明向全省各地兄弟地区提出了“采取一切措施争取快出铁多出铁”的倡议。得到中共保定地委、唐山地委、承德地委、邯郸地委、张家口地委和天津市计划委员会的负责同志的一致响应。
    本报济南22日电　中共山东省委在20日晚召开的市、地委第一书记电话会议上，要求各市、地、县委第一书记以全部精力苦战四十天，坚决地、迅速地使钢铁元帅升帐。省委书记处书记白如冰在作总结发言中指出，为了完成全省今年生产生铁七十五万吨和钢二十五万吨的计划，全力以赴抓钢铁，必须在国庆节前夕，力争达到生铁二十万吨，钢七万吨的产量要求。会上，他还宣布了省委大抓钢铁生产的十项决定：一、必须坚决贯彻执行“以钢为纲，带动其他工业大发展”的方针。二、各级党委必须立即加强对钢铁生产的领导，第一书记在会后立即以全部精力抓钢铁四十天。三、加强地区间、部门间、工农间的共产主义协作关系。四、大力收集废钢铁。五、各级党委要加强对铁矿石开采、炼焦、生产冶炼设备的领导。六、各地立即采取有效措施，改进交通运输工作。七、已建成的炼铁炉要从速投入生产，并使生产正常起来，继续大力发展小高炉，广泛利用代用品建炉。八、没有铁矿石资源的专区，要组织相当力量到有矿石的专区去炼钢炼铁；有矿石的专区应给予大力支持和帮助。九、注意降低炼铁成本。十、劳动力的使用，应认真研究，全面安排。
    据新华社广州21日电　广东省针对当前钢铁工业存在的主要矛盾，采取全面领导、三管齐下的措施，保证完成今年的钢铁生产任务。
    到目前为止，投入生产的小高炉只占已建成数的三分之一。省领导部门找出了当前钢铁生产中的主要矛盾后，立即采取加强全面领导，技术、原料、设备三管齐下的措施，来全面地解决这些矛盾。中共广东省委和省人民委员会，最近派出了以中共广东省委书记、省长陈郁为首的七个钢铁检查组（各组都有工程技术人员参加），会同各专区和县的负责干部，一起到各地作全面检查，及时解决问题，总结钢铁生产的经验。
    省委要求全省各地保证已建成和即将建成的四千个高炉在半个月内正常出铁，力争超额完成今年产钢三十万吨、铁五十万吨的任务。
    本报西安22日电　陕西省由一千名技术人员组成的六个工作大队，最近分赴汉中、安康、商雒、延安、榆林专区和关中地区，加强各地新建炼铁炼钢工业的技术指导。这支包括地质、采矿、化验和冶炼等专业的技术队伍，将协助以上各地解决小高炉、土高炉建设和生产当中的技术问题。
    加强技术指导是目前陕西迅速发展钢铁工业中的重要问题。陕西省过去根本没有钢铁工业，缺乏钢铁工业建设和生产的经验，因此在建设钢铁工业中遇到许多技术上的困难，影响了生产和建设。已建成的炼铁炉由于缺乏冶炼技术指导，有一部分不能立即投入生产；已投入生产的五十二座土铁炉和小高炉，有的因为存在操作技术等问题，影响正常生产。
    中共陕西省委在全面检查了钢铁工业发展中的这些问题以后，决定在继续加强各级领导、依靠发动群众的同时，立即从冶金工业局、地质局、交通大学、西北大学、地质学校等单位，抽调了技术力量派往全省各地。
    本报南昌22日电　江西省于21日组成钢铁生产检查团将对全省钢铁工业进行检查，促进钢铁建设事业的跃进。
    检查团由省委第一书记杨尚奎任总团长，省委书记邵式平、方志纯、刘俊秀、白栋材任副总团长，省委常委、各区党委、地委第一书记和书记分别担任分团正副团长，抽调一切可能抽调的技术力量和农业生产检查团结合起来组成检查钢铁生产的十万大军。
    自从6月中旬省委提出实现钢铁工业大跃进的号召以后，到8月上旬全省建大小高炉四千五百多个，但到17日止，全省只生产铁二万吨，每天出铁不到一千吨。就是说，全省共建成土高炉四千多个，其中比较正常生产的铁炉只有四百七十个，还有90％左右的铁炉不能正常出铁。省委认为这种情况如不迅速扭转，钢铁生产就有完不成任务的危险。
    省委还指出，当前钢铁生产速度与计划要求相差甚远，必须把现在日产千吨提高到一万吨。为此，省委决定：钢铁生产检查大军日内即进入钢铁生产阵地，农业生产检查团立即把钢铁生产抓起来，分片包干，限期解决问题，以争取粮食、钢铁两大丰收。
