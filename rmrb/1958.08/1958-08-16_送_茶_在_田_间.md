　　Sending Tea in the Fields
    Recently, I went to Nancheng County, Jiangxi Province, to work and saw many new things. I saw the Young Pioneers of Bogan Elementary School in this county supporting the agricultural cooperative's summer planting. Each of them held a small red flag and various tea sets filled with tea, singing "Socialism is Good" as they delivered tea to the fields. The children were warmly welcomed by the commune members wherever they went. Holding the tea in their hands, they said to the commune members who were busily rushing to harvest and plant, "Uncles and aunties, you're working hard, please have a cup of cool tea." The commune members said with great gratitude, "These are good students educated by Chairman Mao." Wu

　　送·茶·在·田·间
    最近我到江西省南城县去工作，看到了不少新事情。我看到这个县珀玕小学的少先队员们为了支援农业社夏种，他们一个个手中拿着一面小红旗和盛满了茶的各种茶具，唱着“社会主义好”的歌子到田间送茶。小朋友走到哪里都受到社员的热烈欢迎。他们手中捧着茶对正在紧张地抢收抢种的社员说：“叔叔、伯伯辛苦了，请喝一杯凉茶。”社员们感激万分地说：“这是毛主席教养出来的好学生。”　吴
