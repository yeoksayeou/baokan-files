An Important System in Socialist Construction
*Shanxi Daily* Editorial

The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's "Decision on Establishing a Labor Army Combining Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers in the Rural Areas of the Province" is being rapidly implemented throughout the province. A labor army of more than 3.6 million people, who are both workers, peasants, and soldiers, has been initially established. This is a very exciting thing and an important system in socialist construction. This system not only has strong practical significance, but also has very significant and far-reaching significance. Because with this labor army that combines workers, peasants, and soldiers, the strength to build socialism and defend socialism will be greatly enhanced, the face of the entire labor front will be rapidly changed, and the growth of communist factors will be promoted.

　　Labor shortages have become an increasingly serious problem since the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Judging only from the current situation, according to the needs of the overall leap forward plan for industrial and agricultural production in the province, the province is short of 1.5 million laborers. Obviously, solving the problem of labor shortages has become a decisive issue in ensuring the simultaneous leap forward of industry and agriculture. However, labor shortages are a difficulty in the advancement of socialist construction, and it itself includes many positive factors to overcome the difficulties. In the past six months or so, various places have created many successful experiences in solving the problem of labor shortages, such as carrying out mass movements of tool and technological revolution, improving labor organization to improve working hours utilization, implementing the socialization of household labor, liberating women's labor force, implementing the education system and labor system of part-work and part-study, and so on. The establishment of a labor army that is both workers, peasants, and soldiers is an extremely powerful way to solve the problem of labor shortages.

　　Why do we say that? First, the establishment of a labor army that combines workers, peasants, and soldiers organizes the strongest labor force in the countryside, making it a team with organization, discipline, and combat effectiveness, which plays a very important role in improving labor efficiency. The experience of Yuci area has proved that when such a labor army is put into agricultural production, even if it undertakes the most arduous tasks, their labor efficiency can be improved by about 30% compared with ordinary laborers. We know that the improvement of labor productivity means the saving of labor force, and the saving of a large number of labor force will naturally be of great help to overcome the labor shortage. The fact that the Dajia Nan Huoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Beitian Township, Yuci, rapidly changed the labor shortage phenomenon after organizing the "field army" that was both workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the labor efficiency was increased by 45% compared with the production quota, convincingly proves this point. Second, because the labor army that is both workers, peasants, and soldiers is organized according to the principle of overall consideration of industrial and agricultural production, it can go beyond the scope of counties, townships, cooperatives, and even provinces to carry out large-scale labor cooperation. This is also a powerful measure to solve the labor shortage. Since this year, due to the labor shortage, the phenomenon of industry and agriculture competing for labor has appeared in many places. With the labor army combining workers, peasants, and soldiers, this problem can be solved relatively easily. People from the countryside who are sixteen to twenty-five years old will become basic reserve workers, and they will participate in labor in county-run or above industrial, mining, transportation enterprises according to the principle of relatively fixed and batch rotation. This stores the reserve force for industrial construction in agricultural production, fundamentally guarantees the supply of labor for industrial construction, and can avoid the phenomenon of idleness and waste when industrial and mining enterprises stop work or reduce production. Such a scientific organization and use of labor can ensure both the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the Great Leap Forward in industrial production.

　　The establishment of a labor army that is both workers, peasants, and soldiers is not only one of the important measures to solve the labor shortage, but also a way to narrow the gap between workers and peasants and foster communist factors. The Party's general line for socialist construction requires us to "build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible." To complete this glorious and arduous task, we need people, especially all-round people. With the reserve worker system, millions of farmers in the province have the opportunity to take turns to work in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises. This can not only help them to generally receive the training of the working class ideology and learn the advanced technology of modern industry, and become socialist laborers who can both farm and work, but also when they bring the ideology of the working class, industrial production technology, and advanced scientific knowledge back to the countryside, they can also cultivate a large number of talents with a certain cultural and technical level and the working class ideology for the agricultural front, thereby accelerating the realization of the technological revolution in the countryside. In this way, in a few years, the province will have a large number of new-type laborers who are both workers, peasants, and soldiers, who are cultured, technically competent, and have communist ideological awareness, and become a backbone force on the worker-peasant front. And the essential difference between workers and peasants will become smaller and smaller.

　　The establishment of a labor army that is both workers, peasants, and soldiers is also a good way to promote the militia system of "combining labor and military affairs." As we all know, "combining labor and military affairs" is an excellent traditional system in our militia work. In the past years of war, it once played a huge role. Today, in the all-round Great Leap Forward of socialist construction in our country, especially when imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, and the American and British imperialists have launched an aggression against the Middle East, seriously threatening world peace, strengthening this system is of more important significance. After the establishment of a labor army that is both workers, peasants, and soldiers, 550,000 basic militia members in the province will become the backbone of the labor army, which will not only facilitate their role as pioneers and leaders in production, but also help them quickly improve their production technology. Moreover, it is a good organizational form for carrying out political education and military education for young men and women farmers. The practice in many areas has proved that the basic militia members participated in the labor army, while producing and practicing martial arts, and have made excellent achievements in the reserve training work with more, faster, better and more economical results, which is much better than the old-fashioned training methods that are divorced from production in the past. Our militia work is centered on "combining labor and military affairs." When the system of "combining labor and military affairs" is greatly strengthened through the establishment of a labor army combining workers, peasants, and soldiers, the militia work will undoubtedly present a new situation of the Great Leap Forward. In this way, our national defense reserve and local security forces will be greatly strengthened.

### 社会主义建设事业中的一项重要制度

　　社会主义建设事业中的一项重要制度
　　山西日报社论
　　中共山西省委“关于在全省农村中建立工农兵相结合的劳动大军”的决定，全省各地正在迅速地贯彻执行。一支三百六十多万亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军已初步建立起来。这是个十分令人兴奋的事情，是社会主义建设事业中一项重要的制度。这项制度不仅具有强烈的现实意义，而且有非常重大的深远意义。因为有了这一支工农兵相结合的劳动大军，将大大增强建设社会主义和保卫社会主义的力量，迅速地改变着整个劳动战线的面貌，同时将促进共产主义因素的滋长。
    劳动力不足，是社会主义建设大跃进以来所出现的一个愈来愈加严重的问题。只就目前的情况来说，按全省工农业生产全面跃进计划的需要，全省即缺短劳动力一百五十万个。很显然，解决劳动力不足的问题，已成为保证工业和农业同时大跃进的一个决定性的问题。但劳动力紧张，是社会主义建设前进中的困难，它本身就包括着许多克服困难的积极因素。最近半年多以来，各地已经创造出许多解决劳动力不足问题的成功经验，诸如开展工具和技术革命的群众运动，改善劳动组织提高工时利用率，实行家庭劳动社会化，解放妇女劳动力，实行半工半读的教育制度和劳动制度等等，而建立亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军，则是解决劳力不足问题的一个极为有力的办法。
    为什么这样说呢？第一，建立亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军，就把农村中最强的劳动力组织起来，成为一支具有组织性、纪律性、战斗性的队伍，对提高劳动效率作用非常之大。榆次地区的经验已经证明，把这样的劳动大军投入农业生产，即使是担负最艰巨的任务，他们的劳动效率比一般劳动者还可以提高30％左右。我们知道，劳动生产率的提高，就意味着劳动力的节省，而大批的节省劳动力，自然对克服劳动力不足就大有帮助。榆次北田乡大伽南火光农业社在组织起亦工亦农亦兵的“野战部队”以后，劳动效率比生产定额提高了45％，劳动力紧张现象迅速得到改变的事实，就很有说服力地证明了这一点。第二，因为亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军，是按照工农业生产统筹兼顾的原则组织起来的，它就可以超越县、乡、社以至省的范围，去进行大规模的劳动协作。这对于解决劳动力不足，同样是一个有力的措施。今年以来，由于劳动力紧张，在许多地方都出现了工农业生产互争劳动力的现象。有了工农兵结合的劳动大军，这个问题就可以比较容易地得到解决。农村里十六周岁到二十五周岁的人，都将成为基干预备工，他们将根据相对固定、分批轮换的原则，到县营以上的工矿交通企业中参加劳动。这就把工业建设的后备力量，储藏在农业生产之中，使工业建设劳动力的供应，获得了根本保证，又可以避免在工矿企业停工或减产时，发生窝工浪费现象。这样科学的组织与使用劳动力，就可以做到既保证农业生产大跃进，也保证工业生产大跃进。
    建立亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军，不独是解决劳动力不足的重要措施之一，它也是缩小工农差别、滋长共产主义因素的一个途径。党的社会主义建设总路线要求我们“尽快地把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。“要完成这个光荣而又艰巨的任务，需要人，特别是需要全能的人。有了预备工制度，全省数百万农民都有了轮流到工矿交通企业劳动的机会。这不仅可以帮助他们普遍得到工人阶级思想意识的锻炼，学到现代工业的先进技术，成为既能务农又能务工的社会主义劳动者，而且当他们把工人阶级的思想、工业生产技术和先进的科学知识带回农村以后，还可以为农业战线上培养出许许多多具有一定文化技术水平和工人阶级思想意识的人材，从而加速农村的技术革命的实现。这样，在若干年以后，全省就会有大量的、亦工亦农亦兵的、有文化、有技术的、新型的具有共产主义思想觉悟的劳动者，成为工农战线上一支骨干力量。而工人与农民的本质差别，也就越来越缩小了。
    建立亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军，又是推行“劳武结合”的民兵制度的好办法。大家知道，“劳武结合”是我们民兵工作中一项优良的传统制度。在以往的战争年月里，它曾经发挥过巨大的作用，在今天我国社会主义建设全面大跃进中，特别是在帝国主义加紧扩军备战，美英帝国主义已经向中东发动侵略，严重威胁世界和平的形势下，加强这一制度，就具有更加重要的意义。建立起亦工亦农亦兵的劳动大军以后，全省五十五万基干民兵，都将成为劳动大军中的骨干，这不仅便于发挥他们在生产中的先锋带头作用，也有助于帮助他们迅速提高生产技术。而且是向青壮年男女农民进行政治教育、军事教育的一种良好的组织形式。许多地区的实践已经证明，基干民兵们参加了劳动大军，一边生产，一边练武，在预备役训练工作上，都作出了多快好省的优良成绩，比过去脱离生产的、老一套的训练办法好得多。我们的民兵工作是以“劳武结合”为中心的，当“劳武结合”的制度，通过建立工农兵相结合的劳动大军，得到大大加强以后，民兵工作无疑要呈现一个大跃进的新局面，这样，我们的国防后备与地方治安力量，就会得到大大的增强。
