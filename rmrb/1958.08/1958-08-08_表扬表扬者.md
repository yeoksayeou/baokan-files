    Praising the Praisers
    Xin Yao

    In the morning, I took the bus to work. Midway, a female passenger boarded, carrying a straw bag in her hand and holding an eight- or nine-month-old baby. It looked like a young mother "bringing her child to work." The conductor (female) immediately took the child when she saw the mother and child, smiled at the baby with the same loving expression as a mother, then quickly arranged a seat for the female passenger, and gently returned the child to the mother's arms.

    Attentive, kind, warm—a kind of communist fervor immediately enlivened the small society of the bus. Although it was the scorching July heat, I felt a sense of "spring in the world."

    There was an "Appraisal and Criticism" suggestion book on the bus. After the female passenger was seated, she immediately wrote down her personal experience in the praise column. Her expression seemed very serious and earnest while writing. Indeed, she was moved by the service attitude of the conductor, but it aroused another thought in me.

    In our society, new people and new things, infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause, are forming and growing in ordinary postures day and night. For them, it is certainly worth our praise, but for those who are serious and earnest, do not mind being tedious, and are brave in praising any advanced things, they are equally worthy of our praise, because this precisely illustrates that these praisers do not adopt a cold, indifferent, or evasive attitude towards the new life, but rather accept and respond to life with the same positive attitude. Some people are indifferent because they dislike trouble or are "not used to it," which is in fact a lazy and detached attitude. On this point, those who diligently and earnestly strive to "promote good" are the first to practice a word that is universally used in this great era: "Dare!"

    While praising the advanced, I think we should also praise the praisers.

    表扬表扬者
    辛尧
    早晨，我乘着公共汽车去上班。中途上来了一位女乘客，手里携着一只草皮包，怀里还抱着一个八九个月的孩子。看样子，还是一个“带子上班”的年轻的妈妈。售票员同志（女）一看到她们母子两人，就立刻热情地将孩子接了过去，以同样的母亲的慈祥向孩子微微一笑，然后又敏捷地为这位女乘客安排了一个座位，于是再轻轻地将孩子送到了妈妈的手中。
    殷勤、亲切、温暖——一种共产主义的热气顿时就活跃在小小的车厢社会里了。虽然是烈日当空的七月天，在我却大有“春到人间”之感。
    车上是设有“表扬与批评”的意见簿的。这位女乘客坐定后，立刻就在表扬栏中写下了自己的亲身的体会。写时的神情显得十分的严肃十分的认真。不错，她是为这位售票同志的服务态度所感动了，但我却引起另一种的感想。
    在我们社会里，一切对于革命事业无限忠诚的新人新事，正在以平凡的姿态日日夜夜的形成着、生长着。对于她们，固然值得我们表扬，然而对于那些严肃认真、不嫌烦琐、对待任何先进事物勇于表扬的表扬者，一样值得我们赞美，因为这正说明了这些表扬者对新生活并不是采取冷淡的旁观或回避的态度，而是同样以积极态度来接受生活、回答生活的。有些人，不正是为了嫌麻烦或“不习惯”而无动于衷么？事实上恰恰是一种懒汉思想和作客思想。在这一点上，这些勤勤恳恳努力“扬善”的人，首先就实践了为这个伟大的时代所普遍使用的一个字：“敢”！
    在表扬先进者的同时，我以为还应该予表扬者以表扬。
