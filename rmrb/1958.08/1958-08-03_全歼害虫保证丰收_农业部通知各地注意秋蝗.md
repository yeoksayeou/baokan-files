Wipe Out Pests to Guarantee a Bumper Harvest
Ministry of Agriculture Notifies All Regions to Pay Attention to Autumn Locusts

(Our newspaper reports) The past month or so has been a tense stage for decisive battles with various pests, and various regions are continuing to expand their victories in preventing and controlling diseases and pests based on the successes already achieved.

July and August are periods of rampant pests and concentrated, intertwined harm. Rice blast in Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang and other provinces is developing extremely rapidly. According to a survey by the Songjiatang Experimental Station in Hunan Province, the infection rate of single-season late japonica rice reached 100%; on July 10, the number of rice planthoppers and leafhoppers measured by light traps in Dongkou County increased by nearly double compared with the previous night. The amount of third-generation rice stem borers emerging in Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces and regions is greater than last year, and the occurrence time is also about ten days earlier than last year. Cotton bollworms, pink bollworms, and mirid bugs are in full swing in cotton-growing areas. In Henan Province, the rate of damage to plants by mirid bugs has generally reached more than 30%. Armyworms are very common in Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces. The second generation of corn borers is at its most severe period of harm. Currently, people in various regions are taking various effective measures to fight against diseases and pests.

The southern rice-producing areas have now entered the second battle, focusing on the prevention and control of second and third generation rice stem borers, rice blast, rice planthoppers, and leafhoppers. The Suzhou Special Zone in Jiangsu Province is organizing millions of farmers to launch another rice stem borer eradication campaign. The Jinhua Special Zone in Zhejiang Province has comprehensively launched a campaign to burn fires to lure and kill leafhoppers and rice planthoppers. In Pujiang County alone, an average of more than 20,000 large fires are lit every night to lure and kill insects. In the Gao Yao and Shantou Special Zones of Guangdong Province, more than 700,000 people have been mobilized and, in a combat posture, have completed the prevention and control of rice stem borers in more than 80% of the rice fields.

The vast cotton-growing areas are currently vigorously preventing and controlling pests during the budding and boll stage. The Xinxiang Special Zone in Henan Province has carried out two or three rounds of prevention and control. On the 15th of this month, Gaomi County in Shandong Province prevented and controlled 240,000 mu of cotton fields in one day. Now, in this county, the cotton fields of more than 50 agricultural cooperatives in nine townships have completely wiped out pests. The Jingzhou Special Zone in Hubei Province is launching a concentrated effort to prevent and control the four major cotton pests. Hebei, Henan, Shandong and other provinces are using An-2 aircraft to spray pesticides to prevent and control pests in cotton fields. According to statistics from Shandong and Henan provinces, more than 100,000 mu have been treated.

Areas producing coarse grains and tubers have organized campaigns of various sizes against corn borers, armyworms, soybean aphids, and potato late blight. Beipiao County in Liaoning Province adopted a responsibility system of "team contracting blocks, person contracting rows" to eliminate insects, catching 3.5 million armyworm moths and collecting 45 jin of eggs in three days. Heishan County mobilized 30,000 people to fight day and night for five days, eliminating 95% of sorghum aphids. Shaanxi, Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces are preventing and controlling potato late blight.

(Our newspaper reports) Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice to strengthen the prevention and control of autumn locusts. The notice pointed out that the summer locust control work has been successfully completed and great achievements have been made, and some areas have become locust-free counties. However, some areas have not adequately grasped the locust situation, the prevention and control has not been thorough, the residual locust density is high, and the egg laying is high; especially in coastal and low-lying areas, drought and dehydration have expanded the locust area. Judging from these situations, it is likely that there will be a large outbreak of autumn locusts this year. All provinces should be vigilant, strengthen reconnaissance of autumn locusts, and make preparations for prevention and control as early as possible.

The notice emphasized: Currently, autumn locusts have begun to hatch one after another, and will soon emerge in large numbers. The summer temperature is high, and the nymphs of autumn locusts develop faster than summer locusts. In addition, this period is busy with farm work, and there is a severe shortage of pesticide powder. Therefore, the task of eliminating autumn locusts is very arduous.

In order to resolutely eliminate autumn locusts, the notice requires all provinces and regions to strengthen leadership in this area, rectify locust control teams, and adjust the use of existing pesticides according to the locust situation. In order to save pesticides, the notice suggests that all regions actively prepare bait and promote the use of poisoned bait prepared with "666," arsenic agents, and fluorine agents. The notice finally requires all regions to properly arrange locust control labor and do everything possible to completely eliminate autumn locusts.

    全歼害虫保证丰收
    农业部通知各地注意秋蝗
    本报讯　最近一个多月，是和各种虫害进行决战的紧张阶段，各地区正在已经取得的防治病虫害的胜利基础上，继续扩大战果。
    7、8月份是各种病虫猖獗、集中交错为害的时期。湖北、湖南、浙江等省的稻瘟病发展极快，湖南省宋家塘试验站调查，一季晚粳感染率达100％；洞口县7月10日灯测稻飞虱、浮尘子的数量比前一晚增加近一倍。福建、广东、广西等省区的第三代三化螟发蛾量比去年大，发生时间也比去年提早十天左右。棉区的棉铃虫、红铃虫、盲椿象正是为害盛期，河南省的盲椿象为害株率一般已达30％以上。粘虫在贵州、云南等省发生很普遍。第二代玉米螟为害正值严重期。现在，各地人民正采取各种有效措施，和病虫害作斗争。
    南方水稻产区目前又进入以防治第二、三代螟虫、稻瘟病、稻飞虱、浮尘子等病虫为主的第二次战役。江苏省苏州专区正组织百万农民，再度掀起灭螟运动。浙江省金华专区全面开展了烧火诱杀浮尘子、稻飞虱运动，仅浦江一县平均每晚点诱杀虫子的大火二万多堆。广东省高要、汕头专区发动七十多万人，以战斗姿态，已将80％以上的稻田的三化螟防治了一遍。
    广大棉区目前正大力防治蕾铃期害虫。河南省新乡专区已防治了二、三遍。山东省高密县在本月15日一天就防治了二十四万亩棉田，现在这个县已有九个乡的五十多个农业社的棉田全部歼灭了虫害。湖北省荆州专区正突击防治四大棉虫。河北、河南、山东等省正在使用安二型飞机喷药防治棉田害虫，据山东、河南二省统计，已防治十多万亩。
    杂粮、薯类产区对玉米螟、粘虫、大豆蚜虫、马铃薯晚疫病组织了大小不同的战役。辽宁省北票县采用“组包块、人包垅”的责任灭虫制，在三天内捕粘虫蛾三百五十万只，采卵四十五斤；黑山县动员三万人鏖战五昼夜，息灭了95％的高粱蚜虫。陕西、河北、山西等省正防治马铃薯晚疫病。
    本报讯　最近，农业部发出加强秋蝗防治工作的通知。通知中指出，夏蝗防治工作已胜利结束，成绩很大，有些地区已经成为无蝗县。但有些地区由于掌握蝗情不够，防治不彻底，残蝗密度大，产卵多；特别是沿海及低洼地区，因干旱脱水，扩大了蝗虫面积。从这些情况推测，今年秋蝗有大发生的可能。各省应当提高警惕，加强对秋蝗的侦察工作，并及早做好防治准备。
    通知中强调指出：目前秋蝗已陆续孵化，不久即将大量出土。夏季气温高，秋蝗蛉蝻发育的夏蝗为快，再加这一时期农活忙，防治药粉奇缺，因此，消灭秋蝗的任务十分艰巨。
    为了坚决消灭秋蝗，通知要求各省区加强这一方面的领导，整顿治蝗队伍，根据蝗情调剂使用现有农药。为了节省农药，通知建议各地积极准备饵料，推广用“六六六”、砒素剂和氟素剂调制的毒饵。通知最后还要求各地妥善安排治蝗劳力，想尽一切办法，彻底消灭秋蝗。
