　　The Urgent Task—Grasp Production
　　Kong Sang
    The situation of local industries blossoming everywhere has already taken shape. Now, people are concerned about: how are the fruits after the flowers bloom? The answer is that there is a lot of good news. Please see today's newspaper reports: after many small blast furnaces in Hebei, Hubei and other places were started up using indigenous methods, molten iron is constantly flowing, batch after batch, and the fruits of steel have already been obtained.
    However, the following situations also occur: some small blast furnaces in some places, after being built, have not been able to quickly put into production; some have produced iron, but the production situation is not stable enough. Some places using indigenous methods to refine copper and aluminum have also encountered some problems in production.
    Perhaps some people who do not believe in indigenous methods have found new grounds: "Look, indigenous methods still don't work!" This statement is still off the mark and does not hit anything. Because things always advance in the struggle of contradictions. Any new thing must overcome many difficulties to develop smoothly. Taking small blast furnaces as an example, the difficulties mainly come from two aspects: one is the insufficient supply of raw materials, and the other is the lack of technical proficiency. As long as we take some specific measures, the problems can be quickly resolved. The examples of normal production of indigenous blast furnaces in Duzhuang, Funing County, Hebei Province, and Xiaozidian, Dawu County, Hubei Province, have already provided us with successful experiences. Therefore, there is no need to be alarmed at all.
    The problem now is that the leaders of local industries should concentrate their attention on this aspect, so that they can quickly produce normally after the indigenous methods are put into operation. Don't just revel in the fragrance of flowers everywhere, the withering of greenery and the thinning of reds, but achieve fruitful results and a bountiful harvest.
    For agriculture to have a bumper harvest, field management is an important part. For industry to have a bumper harvest, production technical management is very important. Without putting effort into this, it is difficult to expect a bumper harvest.
    There is no need to be afraid of contradictions, contradictions will always occur, and imbalance is always frequent. There is also no need to worry about whether the "watch-the-tide faction" is speaking plausibly again, their rumors are just a waste of effort. The problem is that we must actively take measures to overcome contradictions and organize a new balance.
    The experience of Hubei, Nanjing and other places tells us: as long as we put politics in command and truly rely on the masses, and use the spirit of hard work to study production technology, there is no fortress that cannot be overcome. Since we can build tens of thousands of small blast furnaces, we will certainly be able to make every small blast furnace have a smooth flow of molten iron. The key lies in our subjective efforts.
    Those that have already been built should quickly grasp production, and those whose production is not stable enough should try every means to stabilize it. This is the urgent task for small blast furnaces and other local industries.

　　当务之急——抓生产
　　孔桑
    地方工业遍地开花的形势已经形成了，现在人们关心的是：花开了，果实结得怎么样？回答是好消息很多，请看今天本报的报道：河北、湖北等地许多小高炉土法上马以后，铁水一炉接着一炉不断地奔流，钢铁的果实已经拿到手了。
    但是，也发生这样一些情况：有些地方的小高炉建成以后，没有能迅速投入生产；有些出铁了，但生产情况不够稳定。一些用土法炼铜炼铝的地方，生产中也发生了些问题。
    也许有些不信土法的人又找到新的根据了：“你看，土办法还是不行呀！”这种说法仍然是无的放矢，打不中任何东西。因为事物总是在矛盾的斗争中前进的。任何一项新事物总要战胜许多困难才能顺利发展。以小高炉为例，困难主要来自两个方面，一个是原材料的供应不足，一个是技术还不熟练。只要我们采取一些具体措施，问题就能很快解决。河北省抚宁县杜庄和湖北大悟县孝子店的土高炉正常生产的事例，已经向我们提供了成功的经验。因此丝毫不必大惊小怪。
    现在的问题倒是地方工业的领导人员，要把注意力集中到这方面来，做到土法上马以后很快就能正常生产。不要只沉醉于十里花香，绿肥红瘦，而要达到果实累累，丰收盈门。
    农业要丰收，田间管理是重要的一环。工业要丰收，生产技术管理就很重要。不在这方面下功夫，要想丰收是困难的。
    不必怕矛盾，矛盾总归是要发生的，不平衡总是经常的。也不必管“观潮派”是不是又振振有辞了，他们的风言风语只是白费心思。问题是我们要积极采取措施，克服矛盾，组织新的平衡。
    湖北、南京等地的经验告诉我们：只要政治挂帅切实依靠群众，用苦战的精神去钻研生产技术，就没有克服不了的堡垒。我们既然能够建设起上万座的小高炉，我们就一定能使每座小高炉都铁水畅流。关键在于我们的主观努力。
    已经建设好的赶紧抓生产，生产不够稳定的，千方百计地让它稳定，这就是小高炉和其它地方工业的当务之急。
