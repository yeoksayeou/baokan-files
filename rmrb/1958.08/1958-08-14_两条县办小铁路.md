Two County-Run Small Railways

　　The small railway built by Yingkou County from Dashiqiao to Gaokan, more than ninety li long, was completed and opened to traffic in July.
　　The roads in the nine townships of western Yingkou County, including Shuiyuan, Gouyan, Dagou, and Gaokan, are uneven. Every time it rains, they become muddy, and even bicycles cannot pass, making it difficult to transport grain after the autumn harvest. After the completion of this small railway, it can take on the task of exporting agricultural and sideline products from the nine townships in western Yingkou County and importing the production and living materials needed by the countryside, and it can also undertake passenger transport. The daily cargo volume can reach about 360 tons, which can replace 700 large carts. (Geng Wanchang)
　　The first county-run railway in Hebei Province—the Xingtai to Xihekou railway, the six-li section from Xingtai City to the Nandaguol Iron and Steel Plant, officially opened to traffic in early August. This railway, which leads to the Taihang Mountain area in western Xingtai, is sixty li long and is expected to be fully completed by the end of this year. By then, the iron ore near Xihekou in Xingtai County can all be transported by train instead of by large carts.

　　两条县办小铁路
    营口县兴建的由大石桥至高坎的一条九十多里长的小型铁路，已于7月间建成通车。
    营口县西部水源、沟沿、大沟、高坎等九个乡道路凹凸不平，每当下雨天一片泥泞，自行车都不能通行，秋后运粮很成问题。这条小型铁路建成后，可担当起营口县西部九个乡农副产品的输出和农村需用的生产和生活资料的输入任务，并可担当客运。每天载货量可达三百六十吨左右，可代替大车七百辆。（耿万常）
    河北省第一条县办铁路——邢台到西河口铁路邢台市到南大郭炼铁厂六华里段，在8月初正式通车。这条通往邢台西部太行山区的铁路全长六十华里，预计今年年底全部修通。到那时，邢台县西河口附近的铁矿石，就可以全部变大车运输为火车运输。
