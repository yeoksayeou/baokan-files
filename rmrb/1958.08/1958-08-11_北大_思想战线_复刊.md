　　Peking University's "Ideological Front" Resumes Publication

    "Ideological Front," a mass-based Marxist-Leninist theoretical journal led by the Chinese Communist Party Peking University Committee, resumed publication on July 16th. "Ideological Front" was born during the anti-Rightist struggle last year. It publicized Marxism-Leninism to all teachers, students, and staff of Peking University, refuted the absurd arguments of the bourgeois Rightists, and played its due role in the sharp class struggle. After the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, "Ideological Front" temporarily ceased publication. Recently, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement, the Peking University Party Committee announced the "Outline of the Peking University Great Leap Forward Plan (Draft) 1958-1962," which greatly encouraged all teachers and students. While carrying out educational reform, a mass upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and criticizing bourgeois academic thought has begun to take shape.

    The task of the journal is: "To follow the principle of linking theory with practice, with the study of current revolutionary practice as the center, to publicize Marxism-Leninism and the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, to thoroughly criticize bourgeois academic thought and the current main bourgeois ideological tendencies within the school; to raise the experience of actual struggles and work in the school to the height of theory for summation; to help the masses of the school to study political theory, cultivate new forces, and expand the ranks of Marxist-Leninist theorists."

　　北大“思想战线”复刊
    中共北京大学委员会领导的群众性的马列主义理论刊物“思想战线”已于7月16日复刊。“思想战线”是在去年反右派斗争中诞生的，它向北大全体师生员工宣传了马克思列宁主义，驳斥了资产阶级右派的荒谬论点，在尖锐的阶级斗争中起了应有的作用。反右派斗争胜利，“思想战线”暂时停刊。最近期间，在整风运动胜利的基础上，北大党委公布了1958—1962年北京大学跃进规划纲要（草案），全校师生得到很大的鼓舞。在进行教学改革的同时，一个群众性的学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东同志著作，和对资产阶级学术思想进行批判的高潮已经开始形成。
    该刊的任务是：“遵循理论联系实际的方针，以研究当前的革命实践为中心，宣传马克思列宁主义，毛泽东同志的思想，彻底批判资产阶级学术思想和当前校内主要的资产阶级思想倾向；将该校实际斗争和工作中的经验，提到理论的高度来进行总结；帮助全校群众学习政治理论，培养新生力量，扩大马克思列宁主义理论队伍”。
