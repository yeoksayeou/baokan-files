　　New News on Wujiang River Shipping
    The first shipyard in Guizhou Province, the Sinan Shipyard, was completed and put into production in Sinan County in the lower reaches of the Wujiang River in late July. This factory was built using existing buildings and equipment. It will produce wooden motorized tugboats, wooden barges, lighters, and large steel-hulled passenger and cargo ships. The ships on the Wujiang River routes are small and have low deadweight, which cannot meet the needs of transportation development. After the completion of the Sinan Shipyard, the Wujiang River shipping industry will begin a new chapter.

　　乌江航运新消息
    贵州省第一座造船厂——思南造船厂，已于7月下旬在乌江下游思南县建成并投入生产。这个厂是利用旧有的房屋和设备建设起来的，它将生产木壳机动拖轮、木驳船、囤船和大铁壳客货轮。乌江航线船只小、载重少，不能适应运输发展的需要，思南造船厂建成后，乌江航运事业就将开始新的一页。
