Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: A motor transport unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers embarked on its journey home today, receiving a warm send-off from over 800 Korean people in its stationing area.

Since entering Korea in January 1951, this motor transport unit has demonstrated exceptional courage, resourcefulness, and revolutionary heroism. It overcame all difficulties and successfully completed wartime and peacetime transportation tasks. Three companies, one platoon, six squads, and 947 officers and soldiers were recognized for their meritorious service during the war. Additionally, three companies and over 480 officers and soldiers received material rewards and commendations from the Volunteer Army Headquarters and other leadership organs at all levels for their outstanding performance in transportation tasks after the armistice.

This motor transport unit also made outstanding contributions to helping the Korean people in production and construction. In the first half of this year alone, it dispatched vehicles to transport over 570,000 *jin* of grain and construction materials for the local Korean government and cooperatives. Over the past eight years, it has received 75 banners of commendation from higher authorities and Korean party, government, military, and civilian organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: Park Se-byung, Vice Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee, recently led a delegation from Pyongyang to conduct extensive farewell activities among the engineering corps of the second batch of returning Chinese People's Volunteers troops, who greatly assisted in the post-war reconstruction of Pyongyang.

The Pyongyang Municipal Delegation held a farewell rally at the stationing area of this engineering corps unit. Xu Tae-ryong, representative of the Central Committee for Welcoming and Sending Off the Chinese People's Volunteers, presented gifts to the officers and soldiers of this unit on behalf of Premier Kim Il-sung. Vice Chairman Park Se-byung delivered a farewell speech, thanking the engineering corps unit for helping the people of Pyongyang in reconstruction over the years, and presented the unit with a banner of commendation and over 3,000 gifts. Cui Dexin, the head of the engineering corps unit, accepted the banner and gifts, delivered a thank-you speech, and presented banners and gifts to the people of Pyongyang on behalf of the officers and soldiers. Actors from the Pyongyang Municipal Theater, who accompanied the delegation, gave extensive farewell performances in the unit.

On the third day after the Korean armistice, this engineering corps unit joined the heroic people of Pyongyang in rebuilding this heroic city that had been destroyed by the enemy. In the two years and three months from August 1953 to October 1955, the officers and soldiers of this unit, under the slogan of "Building Pyongyang like building Beijing," implemented the policy of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. They completed 38 projects in the urban area, totaling 1,265,240 workdays, and jointly repaired the Datong River pedestrian railway bridge with the Korean People's Army. Over 1,100 people participating in the construction were recognized for their meritorious service and received medals, badges, and certificates from the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In the past three months, the officers and soldiers of this engineering corps unit have spent over 90,400 workdays building an important project for the Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: The last two hospitals of the second batch of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea left Korea victoriously for home on the 6th. On this day, around 8:00 AM, farewell rallies attended by over 3,000 people were held simultaneously at the two stations, warmly wishing these white-clad warriors a safe journey.

Several Volunteer Army hospitals that have returned home recently have established outstanding achievements in their work to resist America and aid Korea. During the war, under the guidelines of "quick reception, quick transfer," they ensured that the wounded and sick received timely care and treatment. After the armistice, they established a new medical system based on the situation of the troops, better serving the officers and soldiers.

Over the years, the hospitals have also vigorously assisted the Korean military and civilians in treating diseases and conducting hygiene and disease prevention work.

    钢铁运输兵离朝回国
    工程兵和白衣战士受到热烈欢送
    据新华社平壤7日电  中国人民志愿军一支汽车部队，7日在驻地八百多朝鲜人民的盛情欢送下启程回国。
    这支汽车部队从1951年1月进入朝鲜以来，发挥了高度的勇敢机智和革命英雄主义精神，战胜了一切困难，圆满地完成了战时和平时的运输任务。有三个连、一个排、六个班和九百四十七名官兵在战时立了功，有三个连和四百八十多名官兵，因停战后出色的完成了运输任务，受到志愿军司令部等各级领导机关的物质奖励和表扬。
    这支汽车部队在帮助朝鲜人民生产建设中也作出了优异的成绩。今年上半年就出车为驻地朝鲜政府和合作社运送粮食、建设物资等五十七万多斤。八年来，获得上级机关和朝鲜党政军民奖励和赠送的锦旗七十五面。
    新华社平壤7日电  平壤市人民委员会副委员长朴世炳最近率领平壤市代表团，到大力帮助平壤战后恢复建设工作的中国人民志愿军第二批归国部队工程兵部队中，展开广泛的欢送活动。
    平壤市代表团在这支工程兵部队驻地举行了欢送大会。朝鲜欢送中国人民志愿军中央委员会代表许泰龙受金日成首相的委托把礼物赠给这支部队官兵。朴世炳副委员长致欢送词，感谢工程兵部队几年来帮助平壤人民恢复建设，并赠给这支部队一面锦旗和三千多件礼物。工程兵部队首长崔德信受旗受礼后，致谢词，并代表部队官兵向平壤市人民赠旗赠礼。随同代表团前来的平壤市立剧场演员们在部队里举行了广泛的送别演出。
    这支工程兵部队在朝鲜停战后的第三天，就和英雄的平壤人民一起重建这座遭到敌人破坏的英雄城市。在1953年8月到1955年10月两年零三个月内，这支部队的官兵在“像建设北京一样建设平壤”的口号下，贯彻了多快好省的方针，共用一百二十六万五千二百四十个劳动日，在市区完成三十八项工程，另与朝鲜人民军共同修复了大同江人行铁桥。参加施工的人员中有一千一百多人在劳动中立了功，受到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会的勋章、奖章、奖状的奖励。在最近三个月中，这支工程兵部队的官兵又用了九万零四百多个劳动日，为朝鲜人民修建一项重要工程。
    据新华社平壤7日电  中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队的最后两个医院，6日撤离朝鲜凯旋归国。这天上午八点多钟，三千多人的欢送大会同时在两个车站上举行，人们热烈地预祝这些白衣战士一路平安。
    最近先后回国的几个志愿军医院，在抗美援朝的工作岗位上，树立了卓越的功绩。战时他们在“快收、快转”等方针下，使伤病员得到了及时的救护和治疗。停战以后，他们根据部队情况，建立了新的医疗体系，更好地为部队官兵服务。
    几年来，各医院还大力帮助朝鲜军民治病和进行卫生预防工作。
