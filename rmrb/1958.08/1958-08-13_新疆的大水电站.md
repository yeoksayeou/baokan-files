　　Xinjiang's Large Hydropower Station

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th—The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is constructing the largest hydropower station in Xinjiang near the ancient city of Kashgar. Upon completion, the power generation capacity will reach approximately 20,000 kilowatts. The first phase of the hydropower station, the third-level power station with a generation capacity of 6,000 kilowatts, has already commenced construction.

The Kashgar Hydropower Station is being built on the north bank of the Kizil River, which flows through Kashgar, and utilizes the river's turbulent waters for power generation. The first phase of the project is scheduled to be completed next year, supplying electricity to Kashgar city, and the second phase will commence soon thereafter.

Kashgar is the largest city in southern Xinjiang, as well as the economic, political, and cultural center of the region. However, due to a lack of electricity in the past, industry could not develop rapidly. The Autonomous Region plans to build large-scale factories for textiles, metallurgy, and cement in southern Xinjiang during the Second Five-Year Plan, so the construction of the hydropower station began this year.

　　新疆的大水电站
    新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　新疆维吾尔自治区正在古老的喀什城附近，兴建目前新疆最大的一座水力发电站。全部工程竣工后，发电能力达到二万瓩左右。水电站的第一期工程——发电能力达六千瓩的第三级电站已经动工。
    喀什水电站建在流经喀什的克孜河的北岸，是利用克孜河的湍急流水发电的。第一期工程将在明年完工，向喀什城送电，第二期工程不久也将动工。
    喀什是新疆南部地区最大的城市，也是这个地区的经济、政治和文化中心。但是，过去由于缺乏电力，工业不能迅速发展。自治区准备第二个五年计划期间，在南疆兴建纺织、冶金、水泥等大型工厂，所以今年开始兴建水电站。
