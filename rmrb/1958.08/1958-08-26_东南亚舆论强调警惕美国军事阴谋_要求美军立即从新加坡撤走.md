Xinhua News Agency Compilation Report: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: International, and especially Asian, public opinion continues to criticize the provocative action of American troops landing in Singapore.

Hanoi Dispatch：At a reception held by the Romanian Embassy in Vietnam on the evening of the 23rd to celebrate the 14th anniversary of Romania's liberation, Truong Chinh, Acting Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, said: The Vietnamese people resolutely oppose the landing of American troops in Singapore and resolutely demand that American imperialism immediately withdraw its troops from Singapore and get out of South Vietnam.

According to a report in the Hanoi "People's Daily" on the 25th: The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace passed a resolution on the 23rd, demanding that American troops immediately withdraw from Singapore.

Jakarta Dispatch：The Jakarta "East Star Daily" on the 25th called on the Indonesian people to remain vigilant about the activities of the American military after the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly passed the Arab proposal.

The newspaper's editorial said that it would be wrong to think that international tensions would disappear. The newspaper specifically mentioned the activities of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait, the Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia, as well as the landing of U.S. troops in Singapore.

The newspaper recalled that before the U.S. and British troops invaded Lebanon and Jordan, they had concentrated troops and equipment in Turkey and Cyprus. "East Star Daily" said that this lesson tells us that any military action has the purpose of creating a certain situation, and therefore we must remain vigilant.

The Jakarta "People's Daily" once again demanded in its editorial on the 25th that American troops immediately withdraw from Singapore.

The "People's Daily" pointed out that the landing of American troops in Singapore at the same time as the United States recently exerted pressure on Cambodia, Ceylon, India and Burma is a way to exert pressure on Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 25th: Indian newspapers have published news of more American troops landing in Singapore, and prominently published Premier Zhou Enlai's warning about the landing of American troops in Singapore.

The "Indian Times" published a cartoon entitled "Waiting for the Crisis," depicting a huge American warship docked in Southeast Asia, waiting for an opportunity to launch an attack on the people of Southeast Asia under the pretext of resolving "internal disputes."

Today's "Indian Times" published a report from its Hong Kong correspondent saying that more American troops landed in Singapore in order to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos.

London Dispatch: An article from Washington by the "Times" reporter, published on the 22nd, showed that President Eisenhower's statement that the U.S. Marines were sent to Singapore for "recreation" was a complete lie.

Even the "Times" reporter had to admit that the U.S. authorities' attempts to cover up their provocative behavior were self-contradictory and full of loopholes. He admitted that Eisenhower's statement was "inconsistent" with that of the U.S. Department of Defense. The article, entitled "Washington Has Two Different Opinions, Policy is Not Unified," pointed out that Eisenhower had said that the U.S. Marines sent to Singapore were "in the sea for a period of time, so they needed a change of scenery," and the British authorities had also said, "That must be the case." However, the Pentagon's statement was completely different, saying that "this detachment of the U.S. Seventh Fleet went to Singapore with the consent of the British government to help protect friendly countries in the region from any 'repercussions' of the Middle East crisis."

A telegram from the "Times" reporter in Singapore, published on the 21st, admitted that the United States sent Marines to Singapore to "show its strength" to China.

　　东南亚舆论强调警惕美国军事阴谋
    要求美军立即从新加坡撤走
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国，特别是亚洲各国舆论，继续抨击美军登陆新加坡的挑衅行动。
    河内讯：越南民主共和国代理总理、越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征23日晚上在罗马尼亚驻越南大使馆举行的庆祝罗马尼亚解放十四周年的招待会上发表讲话说：越南人民坚决反对美军在新加坡登陆，坚决要求美帝国主义立即把军队撤出新加坡并且滚出南越。
    据河内“人民报”25日报道：越南保卫世界和平委员会在23日通过了一项决议，要求美军立即从新加坡撤退。
    雅加达讯：雅加达“东星报”25日要求印度尼西亚人民对在联合国大会紧急会议通过阿拉伯提案以后美国军队的活动保持警惕。
    这家报纸的社论说，如果认为国际紧张局势会就此消除，那就错了。这家报纸特别提到，美国第七舰队在台湾海峡、印度洋和东南亚的活动以及美军在新加坡登陆。
    这家报纸追述说，在美英军队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦以前，它们曾经在土耳其和塞浦路斯集中军队和装备。“东星报”说，这一教训告诉我们，任何军事行动都有着制造某种局势的目的，因此必须保持警惕。
    雅加达“人民日报”在25日的社论中再次要求美军立即撤出新加坡。
    “人民日报”指出，在美国最近对柬埔寨、锡兰、印度和缅甸施加压力的同时，美军又在新加坡登陆，这是对印度尼西亚施加压力。
    新华社新德里25日电　印度各报都刊载了有更多美军在新加坡登陆的消息，并且以显著地位刊载了周恩来总理对美军在新加坡登陆发出的警告。
    “印度时报”发表了题为“等待危机”的一幅漫画，画着一艘巨大的美国军舰停泊在东南亚，伺机要以解决“内部纠纷”的借口来向东南亚人民发动进攻。
    今天的“印度时报”刊载了该报驻香港记者的一篇消息说，更多的美国军队在新加坡登陆是为了干涉老挝的内政。
    伦敦讯：“泰晤士报”22日登载的这家报纸记者从华盛顿发来的一篇文章，表明了美国总统艾森豪威尔所说的美国海军陆战队开到新加坡只不过是为了“娱乐”的说法，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    连“泰晤士报”记者也不得不承认，美国当局企图掩饰其挑衅行为的说法自相矛盾，漏洞百出。他承认，艾森豪威尔的说法就和美国国防部的说法“前后不一致”。在这篇题为“华盛顿有两种不同的意见，政策不统一”的文章中指出，艾森豪威尔曾经说，开到新加坡的美国海军陆战队是因为“在海上已经呆了一个时期，因此需要换换环境”，英国当局也曾经说，“肯定是这样”。但是，美国五角大楼的说法却完全不同，它说，“美国第七舰队的这一支分遣队开到新加坡去是得到英国政府的同意的，目的是去帮助保护这个地区的友好国家，使它们免遭中东危机的任何‘反响’的冲击。”
    “泰晤士报”21日刊载的这家报纸记者从新加坡发回的电讯则承认，美国派海军陆战队到新加坡去是要向中国“显示实力”。
