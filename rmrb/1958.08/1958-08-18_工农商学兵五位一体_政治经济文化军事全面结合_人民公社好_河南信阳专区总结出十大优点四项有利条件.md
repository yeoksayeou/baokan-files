This newspaper reports from Zhengzhou on the 17th: Inspired by the great leap forward across the country, a great social transformation from socialism to communism—the movement to establish people's communes—is flourishing in the Xinyang area of Henan Province. Trial experience has proven that this kind of people's commune system, which combines townships and communes, integrates workers, peasants, businessmen, students, and soldiers, and provides unified leadership and management, is more suitable for the further development of social productivity in China's rural areas. It demonstrates greater superiority than ordinary cooperatives and can more effectively promote a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture, thereby accelerating the development process of agricultural mechanization and electrification. It is the best grassroots organizational form for the comprehensive development of rural economy and cultural undertakings, and for establishing a communist system in the vast countryside. The establishment of people's communes marks a major step forward in China's agricultural collectivization system.

This great transformation is the result of the comprehensive great leap forward in the Xinyang area over the past year. Through a series of struggles such as rectification, anti-rightist campaigns, rural socialist education, and party and commune consolidation, the broad masses of people have clearly distinguished the boundaries between the two roads and strengthened their determination to take the socialist road. While achieving a decisive victory on the political and ideological front, the entire region has witnessed a situation of great leap forward in production, achieved initial water conservancy, and reaped an unprecedented summer harvest. A nationwide upsurge in running industries by the whole party and the entire people has also been widely launched. In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, various localities have universally established organizations such as nurseries, canteens, "happiness homes," and maternity hospitals, and have carried out large-scale socialist cooperation between townships and communes. In the struggle to win a bumper harvest, the broad masses of people, on the one hand, recognized the great role of collective strength in transforming nature, developing production, and improving life, and on the other hand, felt that small cooperatives could not meet the needs of the comprehensive great leap forward and hindered the development of productive forces. Therefore, changing the existing relations of production to adapt to and promote the development of productive forces has become an urgent requirement of the broad masses. People's communes were born under this situation.

As early as April this year, Suiping and Pingyu counties began the work of merging small cooperatives into large ones, with each county running a large cooperative of six to seven thousand households. In May and June, the small cooperatives in the two counties were successively merged into large ones, and other counties also took action to merge into large cooperatives. In mid-July, the entire region formed a high tide of merging small cooperatives into large ones and establishing people's communes. By the end of July, the work of merging the 5,376 agricultural cooperatives in the region was basically completed. Now, a total of 208 large people's communes have been established, with an average of 8,000 households per commune.

The soaring socialist and communist enthusiasm of the people in demanding the establishment of people's communes far exceeded that of advanced cooperativization. In Suiping County's Satellite People's Commune alone, there were more than 41,000 big-character posters, application forms, and letters of determination requesting to join the commune. When the Chaoying People's Commune in Shangcheng County was established, because the county had not made a unified plan, cadres and the masses were afraid that they would not be able to join the commune. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives forty to fifty miles away sent representatives carrying application forms, requesting to join the people's commune. In three days, nearly 30,000 application forms and letters of determination were written. As a result, the Chaoying People's Commune increased from 13,000 households at the beginning to 15,000 households in one day, and then to 18,000 households overnight. By the time the celebration meeting for the establishment of the commune was held, it had reached 20,457 households.

In order to fully mobilize the masses and raise ideological awareness, in the process of merging small cooperatives into large ones and establishing people's communes, various localities universally launched a large-scale debate on topics such as "Should we merge into large cooperatives? Should we establish people's communes?", "What are the advantages of people's communes?", and "Can people's communes be run well?". For example, after the debate, the Chaoying People's Commune in Shangcheng summarized ten advantages of running people's communes: (1) It can further consolidate the collective ownership system and cultivate collectivist consciousness; (2) It can further develop industrial and agricultural production and realize the policy of combining industry and agriculture; (3) It accelerates the realization of agricultural mechanization; (4) It is convenient for carrying out large-scale capital construction; (5) With a large commune and many people, rich resources, it is convenient to develop diversified economy; (6) The commune has strong backbones, and it is concentrated and convenient for unified allocation and use of labor, and can cultivate a large number of socialist activists who are both red and expert; (7) It can cultivate a large number of cadres and various technical talents; (8) It can vigorously develop cultural, transportation, and transportation undertakings; (9) It has strong disaster resistance and can improve production and living standards faster; (10) It can further strengthen the Party's leadership over the commune. In addition, it also summarized four favorable conditions for running people's communes well: 1. Commune members voluntarily and willingly merge, and have the determination and confidence to run the people's commune well; 2. They have the experience of running the commune and a set of methods for managing production; 3. There is more accumulation within the commune; 4. The Party's leadership has been strengthened. Through the debate, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses was even higher.

After the establishment of the people's communes, they have already shown more and greater advantages than agricultural cooperatives in current production. The former Pioneer No. 3 Cooperative within the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County had only 270 households and 300 mu of barren hills, and it did not have the strength to afforest them. After the establishment of the people's commune, it unified and allocated more than 3,000 people, and in seven days dug 520,000 fish scale pits and completed all the afforestation tasks. The people's commune had nine small mountain cooperatives, which afforested a total of 24,000 mu in the six years from 1951 to 1957. After the establishment of the people's commune, it afforested 55,000 mu in seven days. Before the establishment of the Chaoying People's Commune in Shangcheng County, although the resource conditions were good, the small size of the cooperative limited the development of industrial industry run by the cooperative. Recently, during the establishment of the commune, 2,500 township and commune cadres and 17,500 commune members were drawn out, and within ten days, 4,530 factories such as steel, machinery, chemical fertilizer, and cement were established, and 3,250 of them have been put into production. Various people's communes have also established industrial and agricultural universities and secondary technical schools. Therefore, the broad masses of people cheered for the people's communes, held meetings to celebrate, and resolved to do a good job in various current tasks. Now, in the Xinyang area, 300,000 people have formed a steel army, fighting day and night to ensure that they will produce 800,000 tons of iron and 200,000 tons of steel this year. The region is carrying out an agricultural tool reform movement centered on ball bearingization, and will realize ball bearingization in half a month at a rate of 150,000 sets of ball bearings produced by 500,000 people every day. In order to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops, the production professional teams of various people's communes are concentrating their efforts on weeding, insect removal, fertilizer accumulation, topdressing, eliminating third-class seedlings, and preventing rice lodging, and strengthening seedling field management.

In the process of merging cooperatives and establishing communes, various localities in the Xinyang area paid attention to closely combining with current production and put forward the slogan of: Doing a good job in production and welcoming the establishment of the commune. Each small cooperative and each commune member competed to work day and night, outstandingly completed production tasks, reported good news to the commune, and expressed their determination to join the people's commune. According to statistics from the Chaoying People's Commune in Shangcheng County in ten days, they rushed to plant more than 25,000 mu of sweet potatoes, fought drought and rescued seedlings in 37,000 mu, accumulated more than 40 million dan of fertilizer, and eliminated third-class seedlings in more than 2,300 mu.

In dealing with the specific policies of the means of production, all localities paid attention to fully consult, promote democracy, follow the mass line, and in accordance with the spirit of the general line, follow the principle of being conducive to the development of the socialist collective economy, and all public property belongs to the collective ownership of the commune, and carefully handle the property of each small commune. The size of the commune and the establishment of the organization were also conducive to the development of production. According to local conditions, several townships formed a commune or one township formed a commune. The production organization generally did not move the original organization, and some adjustments were made appropriately that affected production. Now, various people's communes are conducting in-depth research and solving a series of problems related to commune management, such as the system, production management, financial management, distribution system, and political work, so as to fully exert the superiority of the people's communes and develop socialist construction undertakings.

    工农商学兵五位一体　政治经济文化军事全面结合
　　人民公社好
　　河南信阳专区总结出十大优点四项有利条件
    本报郑州17日电　在祖国全面大跃进的鼓舞下，一个由社会主义迈向共产主义的伟大社会变革——建立人民公社的运动，正在河南信阳地区蓬蓬勃勃地展开。经过试办的经验证明：这种乡社合一的、把工农商学兵合为一体，统一领导和管理的人民公社制度，更能适应我国农村社会生产力的进一步发展，比一般合作社显示出更大的优越性，更能有效地促进工农业的更大跃进，从而加速农业机械化、电气化的发展过程；是全面发展农村经济、文化事业、在广大农村中建立共产主义制度的最好的基层组织形式。人民公社的建立，标志着我国农业合作化制度又开始向前大大迈进了一步。
    这次伟大变革，是信阳地区一年来全面大跃进的结果。经过整风、反右派、农村社会主义教育、整党整社等一系列的斗争，广大人民群众划清了两条道路的界限，坚定了走社会主义道路的意志。在政治思想战线取得决定性胜利的同时，全区出现了生产大跃进的形势，实现了初步水利化，取得了夏季空前大丰收。全党全民办工业的热潮也普遍开展起来。在工农业生产大跃进中，各地普遍兴办了托儿所、食堂、“幸福院”、妇产院等组织，并在乡社之间进行了大规模的社会主义协作。在争取丰收的斗争中，广大群众一方面认识到集体力量在改造自然，发展生产，改善生活等方面的伟大作用，另方面又感到小社不能满足全面大跃进的需要，障碍生产力的发展。因此，改变现有生产关系，使之适应和促进生产力的发展，已经成为广大群众的迫切要求。人民公社就是在这种形势下产生的。
    还在今年4月间，遂平和平舆两县就开始了小社并大社的工作，两县各办了一个六、七千户的大社。5、6月间，两县的小社先后都并成了大社，其他各县也有并大社的行动。7月中旬，全区形成小社并大社、建立人民公社的高潮。至7月底全区五千三百七十六个农业合作社的并社工作基本结束，现在共建成大型的人民公社二百零八个，每社平均八千户。
    人民群众要求建立人民公社的社会主义和共产主义的高涨情绪，远远超过了高级合作化。遂平县卫星人民公社要求入社的大字报、申请书、决心书即达四万一千多张。商城县超英人民公社建社时，由于全县未做统一规划，干部和群众都怕自己不能入社，因而在四、五十里以外的农业社，都派代表抬着申请书，要求入人民公社，三天中写出申请书、决心书近三万份。因此超英人民公社由开始一万三千户，一天增加到一万五千户，隔了一夜又达到一万八千户，到开建社庆祝大会时，就达二万零四百五十七户。
    为了充分发动群众，提高思想认识，在小社并大社、建立人民公社的过程中，各地普遍开展了“要不要并大社，要不要建立人民公社”，“人民公社有什么优越性”，“人民公社能不能办好”等题目的大鸣大放大辩论。如商城超英人民公社通过辩论后总结出办人民公社的十大优越性：（一）能进一步巩固集体所有制，锻炼培养集体主义觉悟；（二）能进一步发展工农业生产，实现工农业并举的方针；（三）加速实现农业机械化；（四）便于进行大型的基本建设；（五）社大人多，资源丰富，便于发展多种经济；（六）社大骨干强，而且集中便于统一调配使用劳力，并能大量培养又红又专的建设社会主义的积极分子队伍；（七）可以大量培养干部和各种技术人材；（八）可以大力进行文化交通运输事业的发展；（九）抗灾力强，更快地提高生产和生活水平；（十）更进一步加强党对社的领导。另外，还总结出能办好人民公社的四条有利条件：一、社员自觉自愿并社，有办好人民公社的决心和信心；二、有办社的经验和管理生产的一套办法；三、社内有较多的积累；四、党的领导加强了。通过辩论，干部和群众情绪更为高涨。
    人民公社建立后，已经在当前生产中显示了比农业合作社更多更大的优越性。遂平县卫星人民公社内的原先锋三社，仅二百七十户，有三百亩荒山就没有力量绿化；人民公社建立后，统一调配三千多人，七天时间挖鱼鳞坑五十二万个，并全部完成了绿化任务。该人民公社原有九个山区小社，从1951年到1957年的六年时间内，共造林二万四千亩，人民公社建立后，七天就造林五万五千亩。商城县超英人民公社建立前，虽然资源条件好，但由于社小，限制了社办工业的发展。最近建社当中，抽出乡、社干部二千五百人，社员一万七千五百人，十天内即办起钢铁、机械、化肥、水泥等工厂四千五百三十个，已投入生产的三千二百五十个。各人民公社还都建立了工农业大学、中等技术学校。因此，广大群众欢呼人民公社，纷纷集会庆祝，并决心搞好当前各种工作。现在，信阳地区有三十万人组成钢铁大军，为保证今年产铁八十万吨、产钢二十万吨而日夜奋战。全区正开展以滚珠轴承化为中心的农具改革运动，要以五十万人每日生产滚珠轴承十五万套的速度，在半月内实现滚珠轴承化。为了保证秋季作物全面大丰收，各人民公社的生产专业队正集中力量进行除草，除虫、积肥、施追肥、消灭三类苗、防止水稻倒伏等活动，加强秧田管理。
    信阳地区各地在并社建社的过程中，都注意了紧密结合当前生产，提出：搞好生产、迎接建社的口号。各小社和每个社员，都争先恐后地日夜大干，出色地完成生产任务，向社报喜，表示入人民公社的决心。商城县超英人民公社十天的统计，即抢栽红薯二万五千多亩，抗旱救苗三万七千亩，积肥四千多万担，消灭三类苗二千三百多亩。
    在处理生产资料的具体政策中，各地都注意充分进行协商，发扬民主，走群众路线，并依照总路线的精神，本有利于社会主义集体经济发展的原则，一切公共财产归公社集体所有，认真地处理好各小社的财产。社的规模大小和机构的确立，也都作到了有利于生产的发展。根据各地条件，数乡一社或一乡一社。生产组织，一般以原来组织不动，个别影响生产的适当地进行了调整。现在各人民公社都在深入研究解决有关公社管理的一系列的问题。如体制、生产管理、财务管理、分配制度、政治工作等问题，以便充分发挥人民公社的优越性，发展社会主义建设事业。（附图片）
