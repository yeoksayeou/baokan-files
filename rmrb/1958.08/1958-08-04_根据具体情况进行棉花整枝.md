Pruning is one of the major items in cotton field management, and it plays an important role in ensuring high and early yields of cotton fields.

Cotton pruning includes a complete set of techniques: when the first one or two flower buds appear on the cotton plant, remove the overgrown branches at the bottom that do not directly flower and bear fruit, which is called "removing the trousers"; when overgrown buds or small branches sprout from the leaf axils of each node on the main stem or fruit branches, remove these buds or small branches at any time, which is called "removing superfluous buds" or "removing crazy branches"; when the cotton plant has enough fruit branches, remove the top bud on the upper part of the main stem, which is called "topping"; when the fruit branches have grown to a certain number of fruit nodes, remove the tips of the fruit branches, which is called "side shoot pruning"; in cotton fields with excessively lush branches and leaves in the later stages, appropriately remove the large leaves at the lower part of the main stem and cut off empty branches without buds and bolls, which is called "removing old leaves" and "cutting off empty branches."

The purpose of cotton pruning is to artificially control the growth and development of cotton plants according to the cotton's own growth habits and development laws, and according to different cultivation conditions and yield requirements, so as to achieve the goal of high and early yields in cotton cultivation. "Removing the trousers," "removing superfluous buds," and "removing crazy branches" are to remove these overgrown branches on the cotton plant that do not meet our cultivation requirements in a timely manner, so that nutrients are concentrated on the fruit branches that are suitable for our cultivation requirements. The branches on the main stem of the cotton plant are spirally arranged. The flowering, boll setting, and boll opening of cotton on a cotton plant are carried out in a sequence from bottom to top and from inside to outside. Therefore, the more upper fruit branches and the more distant fruit nodes from the main stem, the later the flowering and boll setting will be; beyond a certain seasonal limit, they will become completely ineffective buds and bolls. Moreover, when the top bud of the cotton plant continues to grow upward, the distribution of nutrients inside the plant mainly supplies the upper part, so that the nutrients required by the lower fruit branches are often not met, which easily leads to bud and boll shedding.

"Topping" and "side shoot pruning" are to control the continued growth of the main stem and fruit branches according to seasonal conditions and nutritional conditions, avoid growing ineffective fruit branches and buds and bolls, prevent excessive growth and late maturity, and evenly distribute the nutrients inside the plant to the already grown fruit branches and buds and bolls, reducing their shedding.

Cotton pruning is a complex and meticulous technique. The most important link in pruning is "topping." "Topping" and "side shoot pruning" directly determine the number of fruit branches and fruit nodes on the cotton plant and the earliness of maturity. The effective growing period of cotton lasts until the arrival of severe frost. According to the general time of severe frost in various places, and then according to the number of days required for bud formation to flowering and boll setting to boll opening on the cotton plant, the latest time limit for "topping" cotton in the local area can be calculated. The time of cotton topping should not only consider seasonal conditions, but also the nutritional conditions of the cotton field and the specific growth of the cotton plant. The yield requirements of different plots should also be considered; the reasonable topping time should be appropriately grasped according to the field and the plant. In the past, many areas had the practice of "topping all cotton plants, big and small, after the Beginning of Autumn," which is inappropriate for today's more detailed and reasonable topping technology requirements. Topping after the "Beginning of Autumn" may be suitable in some areas, but cotton fields with different climate conditions and cultivation conditions cannot all be suitable for topping during this period; in addition, the topping method of topping large and small plants at the same time regardless of the specific growth of the plants is also unreasonable. In recent years, some cotton areas have advocated early topping. In the past, when the nutritional conditions of general cotton fields were insufficient and the cultivation and management conditions were not strong, more fruit branches were likely to cause increased shedding of buds and bolls in the middle and lower parts. There was a certain reason for doing so. This year, fertilizers have been increased in most cotton fields, and the management of cotton fields has been strengthened. The yield requirements have been greatly improved. Under these conditions, the method of implementing early topping should no longer be used. This year, Hebei, Henan, and other provinces have proposed to prune according to yield requirements, and require appropriately delaying the topping period according to cotton field conditions and the specific growth of cotton plants. As long as the conditions are sufficient, topping later, leaving more fruit branches, and setting more bolls, even if there are some "frost-after flowers" in the increased cotton production, it should also be strived for. Of course, the main purpose of our cotton cultivation is to harvest more "frost-before flowers," but under the condition of not affecting the harvest of more "frost-before flowers," what's wrong with adding some "frost-after flowers"?

This year, the plant density in cotton fields has generally increased, and water and fertilizer are relatively sufficient. Many cotton fields have lush branches and leaves. Under these circumstances, through careful pruning work, appropriately removing side shoots, avoiding excessive elongation of fruit branches, and paying attention to later work such as removing old leaves and cutting off empty branches to reduce the phenomenon of closure in cotton fields is of greater significance.

### 根据具体情况进行棉花整枝

    根据具体情况进行棉花整枝
    整枝是棉田管理工作中主要项目之一，它对保证棉田的丰产早熟起着重要的作用。
    棉花整枝包括一整套的技术内容：当棉株上出现第一、二个花蕾时，将下部不直接开花结桃的徒长枝去掉，叫做“脱裤腿”；当主干各节或果枝上各节叶腋间，生出徒长枝的幼芽或小杈的时候，随时将这些幼芽或小杈除去，叫做“去赘芽”或“去疯杈”；棉株留够一定果枝数，摘去主干上部的顶芽，叫做“打顶心”；果枝上长够一定果节数的时候，摘去果枝尖，叫做“打边心”；后期枝叶太茂盛的棉田，适当打去主干下部的大叶和剪去没有蕾铃的空枝条，叫做“打老叶”、“剪空枝”。
    棉花整枝的目的，是根据棉花本身的生长习性和发育规律，按照不同的栽培条件和产量要求，人为地控制棉株的生长发育，来达到人们栽培棉花丰产早熟的目的。“脱裤腿”、“去赘芽”、“去疯杈”就是及时除去棉株上这些不符合我们栽培要求的徒长枝，使养分集中到适合于我们栽培要求的果枝上。棉株主干上的枝条是螺旋形著生的，一株棉花上开花结桃和棉桃的成熟吐絮，是按由下而上由内而外的程序进行的。因此，愈是上部的果枝和愈是离主干远的果节，开花结桃愈晚；超过一定季节限度，就会完全成为无效的蕾铃，而且当棉株顶芽继续向上生长的时期，植株内部养分的分配就主要供给上部，使下部果枝上所需的养分往往得不到满足，因而容易形成蕾铃脱落。
  “打顶心”“打边心”就是根据季节条件和营养条件，控制主干和果枝的继续生长，避免长出无效的果枝和蕾铃，防止徒长晚熟，并使植株内部的养分均衡地分配供应到已生长出的果枝和蕾铃上去，减少其脱落。
    棉花整枝是一项复杂而细致的技术。整枝工作中最主要的一个环节是“打顶心”。“打顶心”和“打边心”，直接决定棉株上果枝、果节的多少和成熟的早晚。棉花的有效生育期一直到见严霜的时候为止，根据各地一般见严霜的时间，再按棉株上着蕾到开花，结桃到吐絮所需的日数，就可以推算出当地棉花“打顶心”的最晚时限。棉花打顶的时间不仅要考虑季节条件，同时要根据棉田营养条件和棉株生育的具体情况，不同田块的产量要求也是要考虑的；合理的打顶时间，应该是按田、按株来适当掌握。过去，许多地区对棉花打顶有“立了秋，大小一齐揪”的做法，这对今天的更细致、更合理的打顶技术要求说来，是不妥当了。“立秋”后打顶，有一些地区可能是适合的，但不同气候条件和栽培条件的棉田，不可能都适于在这个时期打顶；另外，不问植株生育的具体情况，大株小株同时一齐揪的打顶方法，也是不合理的。有些棉区，近几年来提倡早打顶，在过去一般棉田营养条件不足，栽培管理条件不强，多长果枝反而易使中下部蕾铃增加脱落的情况下，这样做是有一定道理的。今年大部棉田肥料增加，棉田的管理工作加强，产量要求大大提高，在这种条件下，再要实行提早打顶的办法就不应当了。河北、河南等省今年都提出要按照产量的要求整枝，要求根据棉田条件和棉株生育的具体情况，适当延迟打顶的时期。只要条件够，晚些打顶，多留一些果枝，多结一些桃，即使增产的棉花里面有一些“霜后花”，也是应该争取的。当然，我们栽培棉花的主要目的是多收“霜前花”，但是，在不影响多收“霜前花”的条件下，再增加一些“霜后花”，有什么不好呢？
    今年棉田植株密度普遍增加，水、肥比较充足，许多棉田枝叶繁茂，在这种情况下，通过细致的整枝工作，适当地打去旁尖，避免果枝过分伸长，注意后期打老叶、剪空枝等工作，以减轻棉田的郁闭现象，就更有重要的意义了。
