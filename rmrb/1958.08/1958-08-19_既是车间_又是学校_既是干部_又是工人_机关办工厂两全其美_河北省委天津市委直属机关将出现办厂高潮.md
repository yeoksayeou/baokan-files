　　Both Workshop and School, Both Cadres and Workers
　　Running Factories by Government Organs is a Win-Win Situation
　　Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Direct Organs will See a Surge in Factory Building
　　(Our Newspaper Tianjin, August 18th) In order to increase the material strength for the country's socialist construction and strengthen the labor training of cadres, Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipality are promoting the establishment of factories by government organs. The directly affiliated organs committees of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and Tianjin Municipal Committee recently convened meetings of party branch secretaries of various organs, deciding that all organs with the necessary conditions should vigorously establish factories in the future.
　　At the meeting convened by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Direct Organs Committee, the experience of the comprehensive factory run by the Provincial Posts and Telecommunications Bureau was introduced. During the Great Leap Forward, the postal and telecommunications departments proposed to build a comprehensive postal and telecommunications network throughout the province within three years, and to catch up with the world's advanced level in postal and telecommunications within five years. However, without its own factories, it would not be possible to meet the province's needs by relying only on processing orders from various places and a small amount of imports. Can this be solved by relying on running our own factories? The Party Committee launched a mass debate. During the great debate, many employees believed that the production laboratory of the Posts and Telecommunications Bureau had some machines and engineering technicians, and could run factories. Transferring the experimental personnel and machines to the factory can combine experimentation and production, and guide everyone to learn technology, which is a win-win situation. At the same time, cadres of the Provincial Posts and Telecommunications Bureau can also take turns working in this factory, being both cadres and workers, which is also a way to cultivate cadres to be both red and expert. After the debate, everyone was very enthusiastic about running factories. If there were no tools, the employees would collect them everywhere; if there were no factory buildings, they would use bicycle sheds and warehouses, and quickly built four workshops: metalworking, automatic machinery, radio transceiver, and carrier machine, and they have been officially put into production.
　　The experience of the Posts and Telecommunications Bureau aroused great interest among the comrades attending the meeting from the provincial-level organs. At the meeting, the responsible comrade of the Provincial Direct Organs Committee proposed that all organs with the conditions to open factories should open them as soon as possible, and emphasized that the opening of factories should be combined with the red and expert universities of the organs, and that cadres should be put into factories to participate in work, and solve the problem of "expertise" through the opened factories. The General Office of the Provincial People's Committee immediately prepared to set up an automobile repair factory and also planned to set up a woodworking factory. In addition to preparing to set up an automobile repair factory, the Provincial Party Committee organs are preparing to set up a letterpress printing factory and a sewing factory. The Provincial Machinery Bureau plans to set up a machinery factory. The Sports Commission plans to set up a sports equipment factory. The directly affiliated organs of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee are also starting to prepare for the construction of a batch of factories. In the process of preparing for construction, they all paid attention to starting from the existing equipment, technical talents, and factory building conditions of their own organs; combining with the business or work needs of their own departments; starting from reality, making do with what is available, developing from small to large, and from low-level to high-level. It is expected that in a short period of time, a climax of factory construction will appear in the directly affiliated organs of the province and city.
　　(Our Newspaper Tianjin, August 18th) The cadres of the Tianjin Municipal Taxation Bureau broke the mysterious view of running factories, and built three factories in seven days. These three factories are the Red Flag Fat Pig Powder Factory jointly run by the Municipal Taxation Bureau and the Hebei District Taxation Bureau, the Red Flag Wire Drawing and Nail Making Factory run by the Chengxiang District Taxation Sub-bureau, and the Dongfeng Cutting and Tempering Silicon Steel Sheet Factory run by the Xinhua District Taxation Sub-bureau.
　　The workers in these factories are all drawn from the existing cadres of the Taxation Bureau. Some of the workers are sent to the factory for long-term training as transferred cadres, and others are organized by the organ cadres to participate in labor in the factory in batches and rotations.
　　These factories are not only production workshops, but also red and expert schools for training and transforming cadres. Many cadres who had not participated in labor in the past began to reverse the erroneous view of underestimating labor after a period of production training, and developed feelings for labor. For example, Zhang Shuzhi, a field clerk from the Chengxiang District Taxation Sub-bureau, had more than 20 cuts on her hands from the iron wire on the first day she entered the factory, and she wanted to cry from the pain; but in production, she gradually developed feelings for the wire drawing work, and was not afraid of oil and dirt and fatigue, insisted on labor, and put forward rationalization proposals to improve production.
　　Although these three factories have simple equipment and the cadres do not understand technology, under everyone's hard work, they have produced products that are thousands of times greater than the investment amount in just about a month after starting work. The Red Flag Wire Drawing and Nail Making Factory produces about 180 kilograms of iron wire every day, the output value of the Red Flag Fat Pig Powder Factory has reached more than 1,000 yuan per day, and the Dongfeng Cutting and Tempering Silicon Steel Sheet Factory can process more than one ton of silicon steel sheet electromechanical parts per day. These three factories can turn over more than 460,000 yuan in profits to the state throughout the year. (Attached pictures)

　　既是车间　又是学校　既是干部　又是工人
　　机关办工厂两全其美
　　河北省委天津市委直属机关将出现办厂高潮
    本报天津18日电　为了替国家社会主义建设增添物质力量和加强干部的劳动锻炼，河北省和天津市正在提倡机关办工厂。中共河北省和天津市直属机关委员会，日前分别召开了各机关党支部书记会议，决定一切有条件的机关今后都要大办工厂。
    在河北省委直属机关委员会召开的会上，介绍了省邮电管理局举办的综合工厂的经验。在大跃进中，邮电部门提出三年内要在全省建成四通八达的邮电网，五年要在邮电方面赶上世界先进水平。但是如果没有自己的工厂，只靠到各地加工订货和少量的进口是不能满足本省需要的。能不能依靠自己办工厂来解决？党委发动群众展开了大辩论。在大辩论中，许多职工认为邮电局的生产试验室有些机器，又有工程技术人员，能够办工厂。把试验人员和机器调到工厂里，既能使试验和生产相结合，又能指导大家学技术，学用也一致，这是两全其美的办法。同时，省邮电局的干部还可以轮流到这个工厂作工，既是干部又是工人，这也是培养干部红与专的道路。经过辩论，大家办工厂的积极性很高，没有工具，职工们就到处收集；没有厂房就利用自行车棚和仓库，很快就建起了金工、自动机、无线电收发讯机、载波机等四个车间，并且已经正式投入生产。
    邮电局的经验，引起了省级机关到会同志很大的兴趣。在会上，省直属机关党委负责同志提出，凡是有条件开办工厂的机关，要尽快把工厂开办起来，并强调开办工厂要与本机关的红专大学相结合，强调干部投入工厂，参加工作，通过开办的工厂，来解决“专”的问题。省人民委员会办公厅当天就筹办了一个汽车修理厂，还准备开办一个木工厂。省委机关除筹备开办汽车修理厂外，准备开办一个铅印工厂和一个缝纫厂。省机械局计划开办机械厂。体育运动委员会计划开办一个体育运动器材工厂。天津市委直属机关也已在着手筹建一批工厂。他们筹办过程中都注意从本机关现有设备、技术人材、厂房条件出发；结合本部门业务或工作需要；从实际出发，因陋就简，从小到大，从低级到高级地发展。预料在一个短时期内，省、市直属机关将出现一个办工厂的高潮。
    本报天津18日电　天津市税务局的干部，打破办工厂的神秘观点，七天时间就办起了三个工厂。这三个工厂是市税务局和河北区税务局合办的红旗肥猪粉厂，城厢区税务分局办的红旗拔丝制钉工厂，和新华区税务分局办的东风切焖矽钢片厂。
    这些工厂的工人都是税务局从现有的干部中抽调出来的。其中有一部分工人是作为下放干部到工厂长期锻炼，另外一部分工人是由机关干部定期分批轮流到工厂参加劳动。
    这些工厂不但是生产车间，而且也是锻炼和改造干部的红专学校。许多过去没有参加过劳动的干部，经过一个时期的生产锻炼以后，开始扭转了轻视劳动的错误观点，并对劳动产生了感情。如城厢区税务分局的外勤科员张淑芝，进厂的第一天，两手被铁丝刮了二十多个口子，痛的她直想哭；但是在生产中她逐渐地对拔丝工作发生了感情，不怕油污和劳累，坚持劳动，并提出了改进生产的合理化建议。
    尽管这三个工厂设备简陋，干部们又不懂技术，但是在大家的刻苦努力下，仅仅开工一个月左右的时间就生产出大于投资额千百倍的产品。红旗拔丝制钉工厂每日生产铁丝约一百八十斤，红旗肥猪粉厂每天的产值已达一千多元，东风切焖矽钢片厂每天可加工一吨多矽钢片的机电零件。这三个厂全年可以向国家上缴利润四十六万多元。（附图片）
