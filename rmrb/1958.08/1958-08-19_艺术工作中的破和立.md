　　Breaking and Establishing in Artistic Work
　　Zhou Weizhi
    The art endeavors of New China have greatly developed over the past eight years, forming a professional artistic worker team of about 200,000 people. Their work is closely related to socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, through successive political movements and daily ideological education, most people have made considerable progress in their thinking, bourgeois ideology has been overcome to a certain extent, and a group of Party members, League members, and non-Party leftists has been cultivated. They have done a lot of work in coordinating with socialist revolution and construction, developing New China's art endeavors, extensively carrying out mass art movements among workers, peasants, and soldiers, creating socialist national new literature and art, etc., playing a good role in propaganda and education for the broad masses, and meeting the masses' demands for cultural life, achieving great results. This is the main aspect, which should be clearly affirmed. However, this progress is still far from enough, and ideological transformation is still far from thorough. In the minds of many people, the bourgeois worldview has not been resolutely abandoned, and the communist worldview has not been established. Bourgeois thought, and even feudal thought, still exist seriously. In recent years, the tendency of artistic work to deviate from politics, from the masses, from reality, and from tradition has been very prominent among many art cadres. From the situation of some directly affiliated art institutions of the Central Ministry of Culture, it mainly manifests in five superstitions:
    Superstition of technique, emphasizing professional work and slighting politics. This is a fundamental erroneous thought in art departments. For a long time, many people have regarded technique as the only thing, or they regard it as the first priority, while politics is regarded as the second. They believe that "it is easy to be red but difficult to be expert," and one should "be expert before being red." Some people also replace politics with professional work, actually abolishing politics, being "only expert but not red." They think that "performing well is being a good Party member," which is politics; even saying:
  "People who study politics are fools. Artists can not study politics. As long as artists have technique, they can get along well, even if they are not red." This is completely a remake of "book worship." Many Party member cadres have also lost their direction, focusing solely on professional work, unwilling to do political work or Party and League work, no longer wanting to take command in politics. Some bury themselves in professional work, and are unwilling to actively participate even in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the anti-Rightist struggle. This will inevitably lead to the erroneous path of abolishing the ideological content of art and advocating bourgeois aestheticism. Some composers believe that "music has its own particularity, and one can create even without socialist feelings," while some directors openly advocate that "art is the appreciation of 'beauty'," and "beauty can be sold for money."
    Superstition of foreigners, worshipping the foreign and belittling the Chinese, valuing the foreign and despising the local. The tendency of worshipping foreigners, especially ancient foreigners, is very serious in the art world, especially in music and fine arts. They rarely consider the preferences of the Chinese people, and are very indifferent to Chinese works reflecting real life. Folk music and fine arts are despised and rejected. Some people like to mechanically copy foreign forms and flaunt Western techniques in their creations. They sometimes "adopt" some folk tunes and sing some folk songs, but they are often completely changed in nature and lose their national style. In their hands, it is not the nationalization of European forms, but the Europeanization of national forms. In terms of theatrical performance, the Stanislavski system should be learned. There have been many gains in this regard in recent years, but regarding it as the only thing while neglecting the realistic traditions and diverse performance styles in Chinese opera performance art, without studying and promoting them, will inevitably affect the development of Chinese performance art.
    Superstition of the ancients, valuing the ancient and belittling the present. This is more serious among researchers, and also has a market among creators and performers. Many opera and music researchers conduct research for the sake of research, never considering the needs of the people and practical significance. They are superstitious about ancient books, and vigorously promote the mysteriousness of academic research, uninterested in the study of practical problems. They oppose the study of historical academic achievements to the study of current artistic practice, denying the academic value of the latter. The idea of valuing the ancient and belittling the present among Chinese painters is also serious. Many painters only talk about the Tang and Song dynasties when discussing painting, believing that Chinese painting is getting worse and worse, and regard the techniques of the ancients as golden rules that cannot be changed at all. The idea of valuing the ancient and belittling the present is also very prevalent in the Peking Opera world.
    Superstition of "international standards," obsessed with improvement, neglecting popularization. Many art workers consider the requirements of intellectuals, cadres, and urban audiences more, and consider the requirements of workers, peasants, and soldiers audiences less; pay more attention to the improvement of technology and form, and pay less attention to the improvement of ideological content; some units or individuals, because they are solely focused on catching up with the so-called "international standards" and striving for opportunities to go abroad, have no interest in performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers or doing popularization work.
    Superstition of individual talent, neglecting collective wisdom. This is related to the leadership's superstitious belief in experts and scholars and not following the mass line. Many art workers are superstitious about their own professional achievements, are proud and complacent, attribute everything to themselves, and completely disregard collective wisdom and mass creation, with a very serious sense of fame and profit. Some are corrupt and degenerate in their lives, completely losing the lofty communist morality and collectivist spirit.
    During the period of great blooming and contending last year, many art workers were poisoned by the Rightists and wavered ideologically, because there has always been a broad market for bourgeois artistic thought and individualism and liberalism in this team.
    After the great revolution on the political and ideological fronts of the anti-Rightist struggle, after the criticism of revisionist ideas in the art field, and the rectification movement that swept away the three winds and five airs, the national art circles are now in a high tide of ideological liberation, great leaps forward in work, and great changes in style. The fine traditions of revolutionary literature and art have been greatly promoted. The broad masses of art workers (including many famous artists), in order to coordinate with political tasks and meet the needs of the broad masses, are rushing to go up the mountains and down to the countryside, performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers on streets, squares, and fields. Many famous musicians have also put down their airs, going to teahouses and bookstores to sing, and going to the streets to teach songs. Many artists participated in the work of drawing murals in rural areas. Mass amateur art activities have received widespread attention. Many professional art groups go wherever they can and provide guidance wherever they go.
    In terms of creation, the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical is being implemented, and realistic themes have received widespread attention. In the past few months, various new art works have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, most of which can closely coordinate with production and political movements, and some have higher artistic levels. The performances of Peking Opera "The White-Haired Girl" and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" have opened up a broad road for this ancient art form to reflect real life.
    The trend of artists going to the countryside to participate in labor training has also formed a upsurge. Many artists have made friends with workers and peasants, and some have begun to establish deeper feelings with workers and peasants in labor and work.
    The emergence of this new situation in the art world, with full enthusiasm and striving for advancement, is the result of a series of political and ideological struggles such as the rectification and anti-Rightist movement and the double-anti movement. It makes us deeply realize the great significance of putting politics in command. At present, most national art groups and some private professional troupes have ended or are about to end the rectification movement. The ideological situation of the broad art team has undergone drastic changes, but this is only the beginning of qualitative change, and still needs to be deepened and consolidated. Many superstitions have not been completely broken, and many artistic ideological problems have not been completely resolved. In particular, some private professional troupes and scattered folk artists have not yet been rectified, and some artists have not undergone organizational rectification. The political situation is still very complex, and the leadership and path of the Party have not been truly resolved. There is still arduous struggle in this regard, and a lot of detailed ideological work needs to be done. Therefore, although the achievements of the rectification movement in the art world are great, we should never be satisfied and ignore the continued self-ideological transformation work. In order to rapidly build a strong art team that is loyal to the working class and other working people, loyal to the socialist cause, I think it is necessary to carry out two aspects of work: one is to break superstitions and liberate our minds; the other is to take effective measures to step up the ideological transformation of bourgeois artists.
    In order to thoroughly transform bourgeois artists, we must first have a great ideological liberation ourselves, break superstitious ideas, eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideas in our minds, and truly dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to manage, and dare to take responsibility on many issues related to art. If we still do not understand many problems, and our minds are filled with many superstitious ideas, right-leaning conservative ideas that come from bourgeois influence, we cannot carry out this revolution to the end, we cannot resolutely and thoroughly transform bourgeois artists to make them better serve socialism and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it is impossible to cultivate a large number of completely new worker-class art fighters who wholeheartedly contribute all their strength to socialism and communism while transforming the original art team. Without ideological liberation, there can be no revolutionary romanticism in artistic creation and work, and we cannot inspire communist enthusiasm. Therefore, we must resolutely and thoroughly break the mysterious concept of art, eliminate the sense of inferiority that we do not understand professional work, have no knowledge, are ashamed of being "laymen," and cannot stand up straight in front of bourgeois artists, resolutely and boldly grasp the art work, and seriously manage bourgeois artists and the broad art team. We must have the heroic spirit of the Shaanxi peasants who "ordered the three mountains and five ridges to open the way, I am coming," and pull out all the white flags and gray flags, and plant our red flags in all corners. Art is the expression of people's lives and thoughts and feelings, and is a tool of class struggle, and we are class people, people who have experienced revolutionary struggle and various aspects of life. From this point of view, we should be experts in managing art. And in developing the socialist art cause, we are even more experts, and those bourgeois artists should be great laymen. Although there are difficulties in this work, as long as we rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the broad masses to be "judges" of art work, and strengthen our own political and artistic theoretical study and the study of relevant professional work, many problems will soon be clarified, and we can become experts in socialist art.
    Secondly, we must resolutely break the idea of ​​superstition of the ancients and foreigners, and greatly enhance the prestige of socialist art and revolutionary artists of the new era. Great artists and works have appeared in China and foreign countries in the past, which are worthy of our inheritance and learning; but learning must be combined with creation, and learning is for the sake of creation. We cannot only rely on the legacy of the ancients and rely solely on the breath of foreigners without doing any creation ourselves. Misers are often spendthrifts. We must strive to create excellent art works worthy of the great socialist era. This is the glorious task of the artists of our era. Now, some of our new creations are not as good as the famous works of the ancients and foreigners in some aspects of expression and some technologies, but socialist art is much more advanced than them in terms of ideological content and people's style. This is an essential difference. Because the literature and art of this era is different from any era in the past, it reflects the magnificent spirit of the Chinese working people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in transforming society and transforming nature. The great workers and peasants have become the protagonists in socialist art. Literature and art reflects their highest ideals of creating a brand new world, and there have also been new creations in terms of performance skills. Can these works be written by great Chinese and foreign writers of the past such as Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Tolstoy, and Balzac? As for all the decadent, decadent, absurd, and reactionary art of the modern bourgeoisie, it is fundamentally incomparable to us. (To be continued)

　　艺术工作中的破和立
　　周巍峙
    新中国的艺术事业八年来有很大发展，已形成了一支有二十万人左右的专业艺术工作者队伍。他们的工作和社会主义建设有着密切的关系。这支队伍在党中央和各级党委的领导下，经过历次政治运动和日常思想教育工作，多数人在思想上有了不少进步，资产阶级思想有了一定程度的克服，培养了一批党、团员和非党的左派。他们在配合社会主义革命和建设工作方面，在发展新中国的艺术事业，广泛开展工农兵群众艺术运动，创造社会主义的民族的新文艺等等方面都做了不少工作，对广大群众起了很好的宣传教育作用，满足了群众对文化生活的要求，有很大的成绩。这是主要的一面，应该明确加以肯定的。但是这些进步还是很不够的，思想的改造还很不彻底；在不少人的头脑中，资产阶级世界观还没有坚决抛弃掉，共产主义的世界观还没有树立起来；资产阶级思想，甚至封建思想仍然严重存在着。艺术工作脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离传统的倾向在近几年来在不少艺术干部当中表现得非常突出。从中央文化部某些直属艺术事业单位的情况来看，主要表现为五种迷信：
    迷信技术，重业务轻政治。这是艺术部门中带根本性的一种错误思想。不少人长期以来把技术看成唯一的东西，或者把它看成是第一位的，而把政治看成是第二位的。他们认为“红易专难”，应该“先专后红”。也有人以业务代替政治，实际上是取消政治，“只专不红”，他们认为“演好戏就是好党员”，就是政治；甚至说：
  “学习政治的人是傻子，艺术家可以不学习政治，艺术家只要有技术就吃得开，不红也行。”这完全是“一本书主义”的翻版。不少党员干部也迷失了方向，一心专攻业务，不愿做政治工作，党团工作，不再想在政治上执掌帅印了，有的人埋头业务，连肃反、反右派斗争都不愿积极参加。这样必然会走到取消艺术的思想内容，提倡资产阶级唯美主义的错误道路上去。有的作曲家认为：“音乐有它的特殊性，没有社会主义感情也可以创作”，有的导演则公开鼓吹“艺术就是‘美’的欣赏”，“美就可以卖钱”。
    迷信洋人，崇外轻中，重洋轻土。艺术界中迷信洋人，尤其是古洋人的倾向很严重，音乐、美术方面尤为突出。他们很少考虑中国人民的爱好，对于反映现实生活的中国作品十分冷淡。民间音乐和美术受到轻视和排斥。有些人在创作上喜欢硬搬外国形式，卖弄西洋技巧，他们有时也“采用了”一些民间曲调，唱了一些民歌，但却常常完全变了质，丧失了民族风格。在他们那里，不是欧洲形式的民族化，而是民族形式的欧化。在戏剧表演方面，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系是应该学习的，这几年在这方面有不少收获，但把它看成唯一无二的东西，而对中国戏曲表演艺术中的现实主义传统和多样化的表演风格却很轻视，不加研究与发扬，这就不能不影响中国表演艺术的发展。
    迷信古人，厚古薄今。这在研究人员中较为严重，创作、表演人员中也有其市场。许多戏曲和音乐研究人员，为研究而研究，从不考虑人民需要与现实意义，他们迷信古书，竭力宣扬学术研究的神秘性，对现实问题的研究不感兴趣。把历代学术成就的研究和当前艺术实践的研究对立起来，否认后者的学术价值。国画家中的厚古薄今思想也是严重的。许多画家论画只有唐宋，认为中国绘画一代不如一代，把古人的技法奉为金科玉律，一点都不能动。在京剧界厚古薄今的思想也很盛行。
    迷信“国际水平”，醉心提高，轻视普及。不少艺术工作者考虑知识分子干部和城市观众的要求多，考虑工农兵观众的要求少；注意技术、形式方面的提高多，注意思想内容的提高少；有的单位或个人由于一心要赶上所谓“国际水平”，争取出国机会，对于为工农兵群众演出，做普及工作毫无兴趣。
    迷信个人才能，轻视集体智慧。这和领导上迷信专家、学者不走群众路线的思想有联系。不少艺术工作者迷信自己的业务成就，骄傲自满，一切归功自己，集体智慧、群众创造根本不放在眼里，名利思想十分严重。有的在生活上腐化堕落，完全丧失了共产主义崇高道德和集体主义精神。
    在去年大鸣大放时期，不少艺术工作者中了右派的毒，在思想上发生了动摇，其原因就是在这支队伍里一向有着资产阶级艺术思想和个人主义、自由主义的广大市场。
    经过反右派斗争这场政治战线和思想战线上的大革命，经过对于艺术领域的修正主义思想的批判，以及横扫三风五气的整风运动，现在全国艺术界正处在思想大解放，工作大跃进，作风大转变的高潮中。革命文艺的优良传统大大发扬，广大艺术工作者（包括许多著名的艺术家）为了配合政治任务，满足广大群众需要，争先恐后地上山下乡，在街头、广场、田头为工农兵群众演出。许多名音乐家也都放下了架子，到茶馆、书社去演唱，到街头去教歌。许多美术家在农村参加了绘制壁画的工作。群众业余艺术活动受到了广泛的重视，许多专业艺术团体走到哪里就辅导到哪里。
    在创作上多快好省的方针正在贯彻，现实题材受到了普遍的重视。几个月来，各类新的艺术作品如雨后春笋般涌现了出来，其中绝大多数都能紧密配合生产和政治运动，有的并有较高的艺术水平。京剧“白毛女”和“智擒惯匪座山雕”的演出，为这个古老的艺术形式打开了反映现实生活的广阔道路。
    艺术家下乡参加劳动锻炼也形成了热潮，许多艺术家和工农群众交朋友，攀亲家，有的在劳动中、工作中已开始和工农群众建立了较深的感情。
    艺术界出现了这种鼓足干劲，力争上游的新局面，是整风反右派、双反运动等一系列政治思想斗争的结果。使我们深深体会到政治挂帅的重大意义。目前全国多数国家艺术团体及部分民间职业剧团已结束整风或即将结束整风，广大艺术队伍的思想状况已经起了剧烈的变化，但这还只是质变的开始，还大大有待于深入和巩固，不少迷信还没有彻底打破，不少艺术思想问题还没有彻底解决。特别是有一部分民间职业剧团和分散的民间艺人还没有进行整风，在某些艺人队伍当中还没有经过组织整顿。政治情况还很复杂，党的领导和道路问题还没有真正解决。在这方面还有着艰苦的斗争，需要进行许多细致的思想工作。因此，艺术界的整风成绩虽然很大，但绝不应满足，而忽视继续进行自我思想改造工作。为了迅速建成一支忠于工人阶级和其他劳动人民、忠于社会主义事业的强大的艺术队伍，我认为必须进行两方面的工作，一是破除迷信，解放我们的思想；一是采取有效的措施加紧对资产阶级艺术家的思想改造。
    为了彻底改造资产阶级艺术家，首先需要我们自己来一个思想大解放，打破迷信思想，清除自己头脑中的资产阶级思想影响，对许多有关艺术的问题，真正做到敢想，敢说，敢做，敢管，敢当。假如许多问题我们还搞不清楚，头脑里充满了许多由于资产阶级影响而来的迷信思想，右倾保守思想，我们就不可能把这一革命进行到底，就不能坚决、彻底地把资产阶级艺术家改造过来，使他们更好地为社会主义服务，为工农兵服务，也就不可能在改造原有艺术队伍的同时，千方百计地，迅速地培养出大批完全新型的全心全意为社会主义和共产主义贡献自己一切力量的工人阶级的艺术战士来。思想不解放，在艺术创造上，工作上，也就不可能有什么革命浪漫主义，鼓不起共产主义的劲头。因此，我们要坚决、彻底打破对艺术的神秘观念，扫除所谓不懂业务、没有学问、自愧是“外行”，在资产阶级艺术家面前直不起腰来的那种自卑感，坚决地、大胆地把艺术工作抓起来，把资产阶级艺术家和广大的艺术队伍认真管起来，要有陕西农民那种“喝令三山五岭开道，我来了”的英雄气魄，把所有的白旗、灰旗都拔掉，在所有的角落都插上我们的红旗。艺术是表现人的生活和思想感情的，是阶级斗争的工具，而我们是阶级的人，是经过革命斗争和多方面生活的人，从这点来看，我们管艺术应该是内行。而在发展社会主义艺术事业方面我们更是内行，那些资产阶级艺术家应该是大大的外行。这在工作当中虽然有困难，但我们只要依靠党的领导，依靠广大群众做艺术工作的“评判员”，加强自己的政治艺术理论学习和有关业务的钻研，许多问题很快就会摸清楚的，就可以变成社会主义艺术的内行。
    其次，我们要坚决打破迷信古人、洋人的思想，大大地长社会主义艺术和新时代革命艺术家的威风。在中国和外国，过去都出现过伟大的艺术家和作品，值得我们继承和学习；但是学习必须和创造相结合，学习是为了创造。我们不能只靠古人的遗产吃饭，专仰外国人的鼻息，自己不进行什么创造。守财奴常常就是败家子。我们自己要努力创造出无愧于伟大的社会主义时代的优秀艺术作品来，这是我们这一时代艺术家的光荣任务。现在我们有些新创作比起古人和外国人的名作来，在某些表现力方面，某些技术上还显得不够，但是社会主义艺术却在思想内容上、人民风格上比他们进步多了。这是本质上的差别。因为这个时代的文艺和过去任何时代都不一样，它反映出了中国劳动人民在共产党和毛主席领导下改造社会、改造自然的共产主义的雄伟气魄，伟大的工农群众成了社会主义艺术中的主角，文艺反映了他们创造一个崭新的世界的最崇高的理想，而且在表现技巧方面也有了新的创造。这些作品，难道是过去那些伟大的中外作家如屈原、杜甫、托尔斯泰、巴尔扎克所能写得出来的吗？至于现代资产阶级的一切没落、颓废、荒诞、反动的艺术则根本没法和我们比了。　（未完待续）
