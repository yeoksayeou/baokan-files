    New and Old Farm Tools Field Competition
    Thoroughly Criticize Conservative Ideologies and Rapidly Promote Improved Farm Tools
    (Our dispatch) A grand competition between new and old farm tools has enabled the rapid promotion of new and improved farm tools that had been shelved for a long time in the Gonghe Agricultural Cooperative of Yongning County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
    The summer harvest and summer planting in the Gonghe Cooperative were very intense, but the cooperative’s original new and improved farm tools had been shelved due to the serious conservative thinking of some members. In order to solve these ideological problems and vigorously promote new farm tools, the Communist Party branch decided to hold an operational competition to let the masses see which of the new and old farm tools was better and which was worse.
    The competition started with rice transplanting. Eight women participated, four standing to transplant and four sitting on rice transplanting boats. The four women standing to transplant were skilled transplanters, and they had coordinated before the competition, determined to outperform those sitting on boats. The four women sitting on boats, however, were not as skilled at transplanting as the first four, and it was their first time transplanting on boats. When the competition began, those standing to transplant did not stretch their backs, did not raise their heads, and did not wipe the sweat from their mouths, transplanting nervously without stopping. Sure enough, in the first hour, they transplanted three more rows than those sitting on boats. But then they gradually could not hold on, and they had to stretch their backs from time to time, raise their heads to rotate their necks, wipe their sweat, and fetch seedlings back and forth, so the progress gradually slowed down. The four people sitting on boats slowly got used to it. Sitting on the boat, their backs didn't hurt, their necks weren't sore, and they didn't need to fetch seedlings back and forth, so they transplanted faster and faster. The result of the competition after two hours and twenty minutes was that those sitting on boats transplanted one more fen of land. According to their experience, the transplanting speed can be further improved as long as they become proficient.
    In addition, competitions between new and old plows and carts, and shoulder-carrying, threshing machines and threshing buckets have all proved that one person using a cart to transport fertilizer can at least match the labor of two and a half people, and that the threshing machine, with slight modifications, is much faster than using a threshing bucket.
    At this time, everyone realized that improving old farm tools and promoting new farm tools was a major way to solve the shortage of labor. All of the more than thirty light walking plows and five-three walking plows that had been shelved for more than a year were put into use. The cooperative’s farm tool repair and assembly plant is currently modifying ninety-three soil plows equipped with light walking plow heads, and has also pre-ordered two hundred and fifty light walking plows from the supply and marketing cooperative.

    新旧农具田间大比赛
    彻底批判保守思想迅速推广改良农具
    本报讯　一场新旧农具大比赛，使广西僮族自治区邕宁县共和农业社搁置已久的新农具和改良农具得以迅速推广。
    共和社的夏收夏种非常紧张，但是，社里原有的新式农具和改良农具因有些社员保守思想严重，一直搁置不用。为了解决这些思想问题，大力推广新农具，中共党支部决定举行一次操作比赛，让群众看看新旧农具哪个好，哪个坏。
    比赛从插秧开始，参加比赛的有八个妇女，四个站着插，四个坐插秧船插。站着插秧的四个妇女是插秧能手，她们在比赛前就串连好了，下决心一定要胜过坐船的。而坐船的四个妇女，插秧技术没有前四个强，又是第一次坐船插秧。比赛开始，站着插的腰不伸，头不抬，汗流到嘴巴也不擦，紧张地插个不停。果然，在第一个钟头，比坐船的多插了三行。但接下去她们就渐渐支持不住，不时要伸伸腰，抬起头来转动一下颈子，擦擦汗，还要来回取秧，进度就逐渐慢下来。而坐船的四个人慢慢地习惯了，坐在船上插腰不痛，颈不酸，又不需来回取秧，越插越快。比赛了两小时又二十分钟的结果，坐船的多插了一分地。根据她们的经验只要熟练了，插秧速度还可提高。
    另外，新旧犁车子和肩挑、打谷机和打谷桶的比赛，也都证明了一个人用车子送肥起码顶得过两个半劳动力，打谷机只要稍加改装，使用起来也比用打谷桶快得多。
    这时，大家认识到改良旧农具推广新农具是解决劳动力不足的一条主要出路，原来搁了一年多的三十架轻便步犁和五三步犁全部使用起来，社里的农具修配厂正在改装九十三架配轻便步犁头的土犁，另外还向供销社预订了二百五十架轻便步犁。
