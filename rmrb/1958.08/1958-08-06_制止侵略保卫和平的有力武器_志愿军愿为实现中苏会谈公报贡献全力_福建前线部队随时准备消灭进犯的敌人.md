Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 5th: The Sino-Soviet summit communiqué has greatly encouraged the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV). They unanimously believe that at a time when American and British imperialism are attempting to further expand the flames of aggressive war in the Middle East, the Sino-Soviet summit communiqué will become the most powerful weapon to stop aggression and defend peace. All officers and soldiers expressed: we must contribute all our strength to the realization of the Sino-Soviet summit communiqué.

On the morning of the 4th, officers and soldiers of the CPV gathered happily around radios and loudspeakers to listen to the Sino-Soviet summit communiqué. The officers and soldiers told each other about it and held meetings and discussions. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the CPV, who inflicted heavy blows on the invading American army during the Korean War, expressed their heartfelt support for the communiqué at a discussion meeting. Li Guangshan, the deputy regimental commander, said: The Sino-Soviet summit communiqué not only expresses the common will of the more than 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union to stop war and defend peace, but also expresses the common will of peace-loving people all over the world. The unbreakable unity between the governments and people of China and the Soviet Union greatly encourages and supports the struggle of the people of the Middle East against the American and British aggressors. If the American and British imperialist aggressors do not face up to this warning and continue to expand the flames of aggressive war, the people of China and the Soviet Union, united as solid as a rock, will surely, together with the peace-loving people of the world, eliminate them. Wang Jingzeng, the battalion commander of a certain unit, said: The Sino-Soviet summit communiqué further demonstrates the power of the great unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union. This powerful force is the most reliable guarantee of world peace. Officers and soldiers of a powerful artillery unit of the CPV also expressed their heartfelt support for the Sino-Soviet summit communiqué at a meeting. They are ready at any time to stop war and defend peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, August 5th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on the Fujian frontline, who have been vigilantly guarding the coastal defense, warmly support the Sino-Soviet summit communiqué, and unanimously expressed that they must heighten their vigilance a hundredfold and be ready at any time to give the Chiang Kai-shek troops, who dare to invade our coast with the support of the American aggressors, a head-on blow.

When the news of the communiqué reached the various units and frontline positions on the Fujian frontline, the wired broadcasting stations of the units broadcast the full text of the communiqué again and again. The officers and soldiers told each other about it and discussed it with excitement. Song Yuanfeng, the deputy gunner of the fifth company of a certain unit on the Xiamen frontline, who is an "all-around gunner," said: We warmly support the measures taken in the Sino-Soviet summit communiqué to safeguard world peace, and resolutely condemn the aggressive actions of American and British imperialism. We are people's soldiers and will never allow imperialism to push the people of the world into the disasters of war. The Chinese people and its armed forces have eliminated more than 8 million Chiang Kai-shek troops fully supported by American imperialism, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, defeated the American aggressors. The Soviet people and its army eliminated the once-mad German and Japanese fascists. If American imperialism insists on going mad and imposes war on the people of the world, we will, together with the people of the world, completely eliminate imperialism. Gong Zhifeng, the gunner, said: In the past few days, American imperialism has instigated the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen to fire artillery at us to provoke us. We must be more vigilant and prepare to defeat the provocations of the US-Chiang reactionaries at any time.

The anti-aircraft artillery and sailors who guard the coastal defense frontline day and night unanimously believe that this meeting is a meeting to "stop imperialist aggression and save world peace." Huang Erpeng, a gunner on a gunboat, said that the unity of China and the Soviet Union is invincible in the world. In the past few years, imperialism has repeatedly attempted to drag the people of the world into the flames of war, but has been smashed by the powerful socialist and peaceful forces led by the Soviet Union. Today, when the American imperialist aggressors are about to provoke war again, the Sino-Soviet summit communiqué is a great support to the people of the world who are striving for peace and freedom, and also a serious warning to the imperialist warmongers. The sailors also expressed that they must hold their weapons tightly and be ready at any time to eliminate the enemy who dares to provoke us at sea.

    福建前线部队随时准备消灭进犯的敌人
    新华社平壤5日电　中苏两国领袖的会谈公报给中国人民志愿军广大官兵以极大的鼓舞，他们一致认为，在美英帝国主义企图进一步在中东扩大侵略战火的时候，中苏两国领袖的会谈公报将成为制止侵略、保卫和平的最有力的武器。全体官兵表示：一定要为实现中苏两国领袖会谈公报，贡献出自己的全部力量。
    4日清晨，志愿军各部队官兵都兴高采烈地围拢在收音机和扩音器旁，收听了中苏两国领袖会谈公报。官兵们纷相传告，并且进行集会座谈。在朝鲜战争期间给了侵朝美军以沉重打击的志愿军某部官兵，在座谈会上表示衷心拥护这个公报。李广善副团长说：中苏两国领袖的会谈公报，不但表达了中苏两国八亿多人民制止战争、保卫和平的共同意志，也表达了全世界爱好和平人民的共同意志。中苏两国政府和人民牢不可破的团结，大大鼓舞和支持着中东人民反对美英侵略者的斗争。如果美英帝国主义侵略者不正视这一警告，还继续扩大侵略战火，团结得坚如磐石的中苏两国人民，就必将和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，把它们消灭。某部营长王景曾大尉说：中苏两国领袖会谈公报更进一步显示了中苏两国人民伟大团结的力量。这个强大力量就是世界和平的最可靠的保证。强大的志愿军某炮兵部队官兵也在集会上表示对中苏会谈公报衷心拥护。他们随时准备着制止战争、保卫和平。
    新华社福建前线5日电　一直在警惕地保卫着海防的中国人民解放军驻福建前线部队广大官兵，热烈拥护中苏两国领袖的会谈公报，并一致表示要百倍地提高警惕，随时准备给胆敢在美国侵略者支持下向我沿海进犯的蒋军以迎头痛击。
    当公报消息传到福建前线各部队和前沿阵地时，各部队的有线广播台一遍又一遍地转播公报全文，官兵们都奔走相告，并兴奋地座谈起来。厦门前线某部“全能炮手”第五连副炮手宋元丰说：我们热烈拥护中苏会谈公报中所指出的为了维护世界和平所采取的措施，坚决谴责美英帝国主义的侵略行动。我们是人民战士，决不允许帝国主义把世界人民推到战争灾难中。中国人民和它的武装力量曾消灭过美帝国主义全力支持的八百多万蒋介石军队，中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一起打败了美国侵略者。苏联人民和它的军队曾消灭过疯狂一时的德国和日本法西斯。如果美帝国主义硬要发疯，把战争强加在世界人民头上，我们将和世界人民一道把帝国主义彻底消灭掉。炮长巩之峰说：这几天美帝国主义唆使金门的蒋军向我们打炮挑衅，我们一定更加警惕，准备随时打垮美蒋的挑衅活动。
    日日夜夜守卫在海防前线的高射炮兵和水兵们一致认为，这次会谈是“制止帝国主义侵略、拯救世界和平”的会谈。炮艇枪炮兵黄二彭说，中苏两国团结一致无敌于天下，几年来，帝国主义几次企图把全世界人民拖入战火，都被以苏联为首的强大的社会主义和和平力量粉碎了。今天，当美帝国主义侵略者又要挑起战火的时候，中苏两国领袖会谈的公报是对全世界争取和平和自由人民的极大支持，也是对帝国主义战争狂人的严重警告。水兵们还表示，要握紧手中武器，随时准备把敢来挑衅的敌人消灭在海上。
