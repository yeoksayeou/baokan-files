Economic Work Must Put Politics in Command
　　--Beijing Daily Editorial, August 22

The capital's construction is leaping forward at an unprecedented scale and speed. In the first seven months of this year, the total industrial output value increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year, and the progress of industrial capital construction has also been rapid. Taking only local industry as an example, the investment plan completed in the first half of the year is equivalent to the workload completed in three years during the First Five-Year Plan. The upsurge of the whole party running industry and the whole people running industry is developing vigorously. Other economic works such as urban construction, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, finance and trade are also advancing by leaps and bounds.

The reason why our industry can leap forward at an unprecedented high speed, and why our economic work can develop rapidly in an all-round way, is because the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle have achieved great victories, because the general line of socialist construction has been implemented, and because politics has been put in command in economic work. Why can the tens of thousands of laborers who built the Ming Tombs Reservoir and the Huairou Reservoir break the narrow concept of only caring about their hometowns and native lands for thousands of years, bring their own food and tools, and many people go to support others happily even though they don't directly benefit? It is because politics is in command. The equipment of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has not increased, and the number of personnel has not increased. Why has this year's production plan leaped again and again, three times and four times? The possible increase in pig iron production in one year is more than the increase in five years during the First Five-Year Plan? It is because politics is in command. Countless facts prove that when politics is in command, it can mobilize all positive factors, inspire the infinite creativity and energy of hundreds of millions of people, make mountains bow their heads, make rivers give way, and make productivity develop by leaps and bounds.

Now we must ask: Are our ideological and political work in the entire economic work sufficient? In various economic sectors, is politics in command? There is no doubt that compared with before the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, it has generally been strengthened, and politics is indeed in command. This is the fundamental situation. Then, do we still have problems and shortcomings? In some parts and some links, there are still many shortcomings and problems. There, the communist ideology, the ideology of taking the overall situation into consideration starting from 600 million people, has not been fully in command. The red flag of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is not held high enough, or there are still white flags that have not been pulled down. That is to say, in some parts and some links, some people are not blowing the east wind, but the west wind; they are not waving the red flag, but the white flag, or the gray flag. There is no doubt that in our economic work, the great wind that "permeates the valleys and rages at the mouth of the soil sac" is the east wind, the wind of mutual support and cooperation, and the wind of communist ideology. At the same time, there is also a small wind, "born on the ground, starting from the end of the green apple," which cannot be ignored. This is a gust of localism in economic work. This evil wind must be resolutely put out.

Now, where does localism in economic work manifest itself? It is manifested in the fact that some comrades and some units only care about their own leap forward, regardless of the losses of others; only care about the part, ignoring the whole; consider the needs of their own units more, and consider the overall interests less; ask others to help themselves more, but help others less, or even unwilling to actively help; in economic exchanges, some people "only recognize things, regardless of politics." Some people emphasize conditions for socialist collaboration, for supporting other units and other regions, emphasizing that it is beneficial to themselves. When formulating basic construction plans, some units one-sidedly emphasize their own importance, over-report construction tasks, and ask for more machinery and equipment, objectively creating contradictions and a tense situation.

Why has localism grown somewhat in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward? The tasks are heavy, the time is tight, the situation is pressing, the supply of certain materials and equipment is also relatively tight, and everyone is full of energy, striving to go upstream, and trying every means to complete the leap forward plan. This is the current objective situation. Great development and great leaps forward will inevitably encounter new contradictions. How to deal with this contradiction? We can only take the spirit of communism to solve the problem. As long as we act in accordance with the socialist economic principles, the contradictions can be solved, and in the process of solving the contradictions, new great leaps forward will continue to emerge. For example, the Municipal Coal Construction Company, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, and the Beijing Railway Administration cooperated closely, as close as a family, and as a result, they all had great leaps forward. The Coal Construction Company helped the Mining Bureau solve the problem of excessive gangue in the coal, and the Mining Bureau helped the Coal Construction Company carry out technological revolution and improve equipment; the Railway Bureau supported the coal mine's leap forward, and under the extremely heavy transportation tasks, the daily transportation volume increased from 72,000 tons to 156,000 tons, and temporary stop stations were added to facilitate the miners; the coal mine compressed the loading time and improved the vehicle turnover rate, and used voluntary labor and equipment to support the Railway Bureau. As a result, all three of them made great leaps forward. There are many such examples. This is the correct approach and an example of solving new problems in the context of the Great Leap Forward in accordance with the communist spirit. This should be greatly promoted. However, some comrades are not like this. In order to complete the task, they even adopted improper means of "harming others to benefit themselves." Why did they do this? This cannot but be said to be due to our insufficient political leadership in economic work. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach us: Ideology and politics are the commander and the soul. As long as our ideological and political work is slightly relaxed, economic and technical work will inevitably go astray. The unhealthy phenomena that have occurred in some parts, some links, and some comrades of economic work are the result of some units burying themselves in construction and relaxing ideological and political work in recent times.

Of course, the comrades who have the above-mentioned problems of localism are mostly good comrades. Some people are active in their work, but they have taken some incorrect methods. Only a very small number of people knowingly violate the law and behave very badly. But in any case, this trend must not be allowed to grow. If it is allowed to develop, it will be very detrimental to building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Localism is a sectarian tendency, a reflection of individualism in ideological consciousness and one-sidedness in ideological methods. It is fundamentally incompatible with the communist spirit. It is fundamentally contradictory to the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It can only weaken and destroy socialist construction. Even though it still only occurs in some parts, some links, or among some comrades, we must not relax our struggle against it. This is a struggle between two methods: greater, faster, better, and more economical, and less, slower, worse, and more expensive. It is also a struggle between two opposing ideologies: socialist ideology and capitalist ideology. We must identify the direction of the wind, promote righteousness, crack down on evil, and thoroughly discredit localism.

One of the objective laws of the socialist economy is planned and proportional development, which must have centralized leadership, overall planning, and division of labor and cooperation. Our socialist construction cause must give full play to the enthusiasm of all departments of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and the broad masses of the people, and at the same time, we must emphasize the overall viewpoint. The overall viewpoint and giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses must be unified.

Why do some comrades only see the interests of the part, only see the work of their part, but do not see the whole, do not see the work of other departments? Many of them are hardworking bureaucratists, and subjectively want to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. However, because they are buried in specific affairs, they have limitations and one-sidedness in their understanding, they only see the trees and not the forest, and they neglect the overall and fundamental situation, so they are easily lost in the political direction and go astray. Therefore, leading organs must help them broaden their horizons, give them reports on the national and municipal leap forward situation, and guide them to consider their local problems in the context of the overall situation. They must realize that the part is an inseparable component of the whole, and the part and the whole are mutually dependent and mutually promoting. In economic construction, the whole country is a chessboard, and Beijing is a partial chessboard in the national unified system. The small situation must be subordinate to the big situation, the small truth must be subordinate to the big truth, and the part must be subordinate to the whole. Under overall arrangement, there must be priorities, there must be those who go first and those who go later, there must be key points and there must be general points, there must be urgency and there must be slowness, and there must be something that is not done in order to achieve great achievements. If everyone goes first and everything is a key point, then there will be no one who goes first and the key points will be lost, and the high speed of development of our industry and the entire construction cause will be reduced.

Is there a contradiction between opposing localism and emphasizing the overall viewpoint and giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses? We believe that opposing localism should not be placed in opposition to giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Some comrades say: "If the enthusiasm is too great, they will commit localism." This statement is incorrect. In order to increase the speed of construction, it is necessary to implement the Party's mass line in the socialist construction cause, let go of mobilizing the masses, and fully give play to the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels and the broad masses of the people. It is necessary to promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act among cadres and the masses. However, giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses does not mean that leadership and mutual cooperation are not needed. On the contrary, it requires strengthening leadership, strengthening mutual support, mutual coordination, and mutual assistance among various units. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses and the greater the leap forward in production, the more urgent the need for overall planning and comprehensive arrangements. Only under highly centralized leadership can the high enthusiasm of the masses be fully and correctly brought into play. Without centralized leadership, without overall planning and mutual cooperation, taking a laissez-faire attitude, letting whoever wants to do what, whoever loves to develop what, whoever wants to do it how, whoever has what to use, no one supports anyone, and no one cares about anyone, will increase contradictions and create more artificial difficulties, and will not achieve the requirements of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. We must respect the initiative of various units and various parts, and encourage everyone to work hard and vigorously; at the same time, we must respect centralized leadership and overall planning. Everyone must be for me, and first I must be for everyone. For any materials, machinery, and personnel, subordinates must obey the dispatch of superiors. If there are any opinions, they can be raised to the superiors. If the superiors do not accept them, they should be implemented unconditionally. Cooperation and support for brotherly regions can only be done well, not badly. When dealing with economic relations with brotherly regions, we must first start from the overall viewpoint and from the viewpoint of common development and common leap forward. The enthusiasm we are talking about is by no means the enthusiasm that only cares about oneself and does not care about others, only cares about the part and does not care about the whole, and is by no means the capitalist enthusiasm that harms others to benefit oneself; the enthusiasm we are talking about is the communist enthusiasm that helps each other, supports each other, and moves forward together. The greater the communist enthusiasm, the better.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "The development of local industries and small and medium-sized enterprises that we advocate is development under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, and not blind and free competition. In order to prevent and reduce possible waste of resources and funds and backlog of products, the central and local levels must earnestly strengthen the work of coordination and balance, and must resolutely oppose capitalist business thinking and localism and localist tendencies." All communists and economic workers must study this report carefully, and examine their own thoughts and work in accordance with these instructions of the Central Committee. Now is the fourth stage of the rectification, and at this time, the district committees and units should take some time to concentrate their efforts to launch a struggle against localism. Through this struggle, further strengthen the ideological and political leadership in economic work, establish the overall viewpoint and the viewpoint of mutual support between urban and rural areas, and establish good relations of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation.

Is it communist style or capitalist style? Is it taking care of the overall situation and knowing the general situation, or taking care of local interests and oneself? This is a very sharp question, and it is one of the signs of whether economic work puts politics in command. We must mobilize the masses, and through debate, discredit localism. We must, on the basis of letting go of mobilizing the masses and highly promoting the communist spirit, try every means to overcome the problems and difficulties encountered in the Great Leap Forward, and set off a higher upsurge in the city, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan.

　　经济工作必须政治挂帅
　　——北京日报8月22日社论
    首都的建设正在以空前的规模和速度飞跃地发展着。今年头七个月，工业总产值比去年同期提高了40％以上，工业基本建设的进展也很快。光拿地方工业来看，上半年完成的投资计划，就相当于第一个五年计划期间三年完成的工作量。全党办工业、全民办工业的热潮，正在汹涌澎湃地发展着。其他各项经济工作如城市建设、农林水利、财贸工作等，也在大步前进。
    我们的工业所以能够以空前未有的高速度跃进，我们的经济工作所以能够全面地迅速发展，就是因为整风运动和反右派斗争取得了伟大胜利，因为贯彻执行了社会主义建设的总路线，因为经济工作中政治挂了帅。修建十三陵水库和怀柔水库的数万民工，为什么能够打破几千年来只顾本乡本土的狭隘观念，自带粮食，自备工具，许多人自己虽然并不直接受益，却高高兴兴地去支援别人？就是因为政治挂了帅。石景山钢铁厂设备没增加，人员没增加，为什么今年的生产计划一跃再跃、三跃四跃，一年可能增加的生铁产量，比第一个五年计划期间五年增加的还多？就是因为政治挂了帅。无数事实证明，政治挂了帅，就能够调动一切积极因素，鼓起千百万人民无穷无尽的创造性和干劲，让高山低头，叫河水让路，使生产力得到飞跃的发展。
    现在要问：我们整个经济工作中的思想工作和政治工作够不够呢？在各个经济部门中，政治是不是挂了帅呢？毫无疑问，比之整风运动和反右派斗争以前，一般地说是加强了，政治是确实挂帅了。这是根本的情况。那末，我们还有没有问题，有没有缺点呢？在某些部分和某些环节上，还有很多的缺点和问题。在那里，共产主义思想，从六亿人民出发统筹全局的思想并没有完全挂帅。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的红旗还举得不高，或者还有白旗没有拔掉。这就是说，在某些部分、某些环节上，某些人刮的不是东风，而是西风；打的不是红旗，而是白旗，或者灰旗。毫无疑问，在我们的经济工作中，“侵淫溪谷，盛怒于土囊之口”的大风是东风，是互相支援、互相协作之风，是共产主义思想之风。同时，也还有一股小小的风，“生于地，起于青苹之末”，不容忽视。这就是一股经济工作中的本位主义之风。这一股风，是资产阶级思想在这些人身上的反映。这股歪风必须坚决地加以扑灭。
    现在，经济工作中的本位主义表现在什么地方呢？这表现在：有些同志和有些单位只管自己跃进，不顾别人损失；只顾局部，忽视全局；考虑本单位的需要多，考虑整体利益少；要求别人帮助自己多，而自己帮助别人少，甚至不愿意、不积极帮助；在经济往来中，有些人“只认东西，不顾政治”。有些人对社会主义协作，对支援别的单位和别的地区强调条件，强调对自己有利。有些单位在制订基本建设计划的时候，片面地强调自己的重要性，多报建筑任务，多要机器设备，客观上是在制造矛盾，制造紧张局势。
    为什么在大跃进的高潮中本位主义有所滋长？任务大，时间紧急，形势逼人，某些物资器材的供应也比较紧张，大家又都干劲十足，力争上游，千方百计去完成跃进计划，这是当前的客观情况。大发展大跃进必然会遇到新的矛盾。怎样对待这个矛盾？我们只能采取共产主义的精神来解决问题。只要按照社会主义的经济原则办事，矛盾是可以解决的，而且就在解决矛盾的过程中，不断出现新的大跃进。例如市煤建公司、京西矿务局和北京铁路管理局密切协作，亲如一家，结果都有了大跃进。煤建公司帮助矿务局解决煤里矸石过多的问题，矿务局帮助煤建公司搞技术革命，改进设备；铁路局支援煤矿跃进，在运输任务十分繁重的情况下，使日运量由七万二千吨提高到十五万六千吨，并且增设临时停车站，便利矿工；煤矿压缩装车时间，提高了车辆周转率，并且用义务劳动和器材支援铁路局。结果，他们三家都大大跃进了。像这样的事例是很多的。这是正确的做法，是按共产主义精神解决大跃进形势下的新问题的范例。这是应当大大提倡的。但是，也有一些同志不是这样。他们为了完成任务，竟采取了“损人利己”的不正当手段。他们为什么这样做？这不能不说是由于我们对经济工作的政治领导不够。党中央和毛泽东同志经常教导我们：思想和政治是统帅，是灵魂。只要我们的思想工作和政治工作稍为放松，经济工作和技术工作就一定会走到邪路上去。现在经济工作的某些部分、某些环节和某些同志中间发生的这些不健康的现象，就是某些单位在最近一个时期埋头建设、放松思想工作和政治工作的结果。
    当然，现在发生上面所说的本位主义毛病的同志，绝大多数是好同志。有些人工作是积极的，但是他们采取了一些不正确的方法。只有极个别的人才是知法犯法，表现十分恶劣。但是无论如何，此风断不可长，如果让它发展下去，对于多快好省地建设社会主义是十分不利的。
    本位主义是一种宗派主义的倾向，是思想意识上的个人主义和思想方法上的片面性的反映。它同共产主义精神是根本不相容的。它同鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线是根本矛盾的，它只能削弱和破坏社会主义建设。尽管它还是只在某些部分、某些环节或者某些同志中间发生，我们也决不能放松同它的斗争。这是多快好省和少慢差费两种方法的斗争，也是社会主义思想和资本主义思想两种敌对思想的斗争。我们一定要辨别风向，发扬正气，打击邪气，彻底搞臭本位主义。
    社会主义经济的客观规律之一是有计划按比例地发展，必须有集中领导、全面规划和分工协作。我们社会主义建设事业必须充分地发挥工农商学兵各个部门和广大群众的积极性，同时又必须强调全局观点。全局观点和发挥群众的积极性必须统一。
    为什么有些同志只看到部分的利益，只看到自己部分的工作，而没有看到全局，没有看到人家部门的工作？他们许多人是辛辛苦苦的事务主义者，主观上是想多快好省地建设社会主义；但是，因为埋头在具体事务里面，认识上有局限性和片面性，只见树木不见森林，忽略了全面的根本的情况，就容易在政治上迷失方向，而走到邪路上去。因此，领导机关要帮助他们打开眼界，给他们作全国、全市跃进形势的报告，引导他们结合全局考虑自己的局部问题。要使他们认识，局部是全局不可分割的组成部分，局部和全局是互相依存、互相促进的。在经济建设上，全国是一盘棋，北京市是全国统一体系中一盘局部的棋，小局要服从大局，小道理要服从大道理，部分要服从全局。在全面安排下，一定要有轻重缓急，有先行就有后行，有重点就有一般，有急就有缓，有所不为才能大有可为。如果人人先行，个个重点，那就会没有先行，失去了重点，就会降低我们的工业和整个建设事业发展的高速度。
    反对本位主义、强调全局观点同发扬群众的积极性是不是有矛盾呢？我们认为，不应当把反对本位主义同发扬群众积极性对立起来。有些同志说：“积极性太大了，就会犯本位。”这种说法是不正确的。为了提高建设速度，必须在社会主义建设事业中贯彻执行党的群众路线，放手发动群众，充分发扬各级干部和广大群众的积极性。必须在干部和群众中提倡敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。但是，发扬群众积极性决不是不要领导，不要互相协作，相反的，需要更加加强领导，更加加强各个单位之间的互相支持、互相配合和互相帮助。群众的积极性越大，生产越跃进，就更加迫切需要统盘规划和全面安排。只有在高度的集中领导下，才能充分地正确地发扬群众的高度积极性。如果没有集中领导，没有全面规划和互相协作，采取放任自流的态度，谁愿意干什么就干什么，谁爱发展什么就发展什么，谁愿意怎么干就怎么干，谁有什么就用什么，谁也不支援谁，谁也不管谁，就会增加矛盾，更加造成人为的困难，达不到多快好省的要求。我们必须尊重各个单位各个部分的主动性，鼓励大家大干猛干；同时，又必须尊重集中领导和全面规划。要人人为我，首先要我为人人。对任何物资、机器和人员，下级必须服从上级的调度。有意见可以向上级提出，如果上级不接受，就应当无条件地执行。对兄弟地区的协作和支援，只能作好，不能作坏。在处理同兄弟地区的经济关系的时候，首先要从全局观点、从共同发展共同跃进的观点出发。我们所说的积极性，决不是只顾自己、不顾别人，只顾局部、不顾全局的积极性，决不是损人利己的资本主义的积极性；我们所说的积极性，是互相帮助、互相支援、共同前进的共产主义积极性。共产主义积极性永远是越大越好。
    刘少奇同志在中共第八届全国代表大会第二次会议报告中指出：“我们所提倡的地方工业和中小企业的发展，是在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下的发展，而不是盲目的、自由竞争的发展。为了防止和减少可能的资源资金的浪费和产品的积压，中央和地方各级都必须认真地加强协作和平衡的工作，必须坚决反对资本主义的经营思想和地方主义、本位主义的倾向。”所有的共产党员和经济工作者必须好好学习这个报告，根据中央的这些指示，检查自己的思想和工作。现在是整风的第四阶段，在这时机，各区区委、各个单位要拿出一段时间来集中力量展开一个反对本位主义的斗争。通过这场斗争，进一步加强经济工作中的思想政治领导，树立全局观点、城乡互相支援的观点，建立集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的良好关系。
    是共产主义风格，还是资本主义风格？是顾全局、识大体，还是顾本位、顾自己？这是一个十分尖锐的问题，是经济工作是否政治挂帅的标志之一。我们必须发动群众，通过辩论，搞臭本位主义。我们要在放手发动群众和高度发扬共产主义精神的基础上，千方百计，克服大跃进中所遇到的问题和困难，在全市范围内，掀起一个更高的高潮，力争完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划。
