Editor's Notes:

　　New Customs
Since the Great Leap Forward, the communist style has been greatly developed. Recently, state-owned stores in Chongqing have set up unattended sales counters in factories, mines, government offices, and schools. These counters are unsupervised, and buyers can take the goods and pay for them independently. Since its implementation, there have been basically no errors. This new form of commercial transaction fully demonstrates the new customs of the new society. From this, we can see people's correct attitude towards public property. It is truly incomprehensible.

　　新风尚
    大跃进以来，共产主义的作风大大发扬。现在，重庆市的国营商店最近在厂矿、机关、学校设立的无人售货专柜，专柜无人照管，买主可以自取货自付款，实行以来，基本上无差错，这种新型的商业交易形式，充分表现了新社会里的新风尚。从这里我们看到了人们对公共财产的正确态度。真是不可理解的。
