Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 18th: The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided, in conjunction with the Municipal People's Committee, to organize a 10,000-person inspection team to promote a further leap forward in the city's industrial and agricultural production and other work. Starting from August 20th, a large-scale comprehensive inspection will first be conducted on the city's industrial and agricultural production, transportation, and capital construction, and then on all aspects of work in culture, education, commerce, neighborhoods, and government organs. This is to gain an in-depth understanding of the rectification at the grassroots level and the progress of production and work, further encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and cadres, and take concrete measures to promote the advanced to become even more advanced, and the intermediate and backward to quickly catch up with the advanced. This will form a massive momentum of further leap forward throughout the city, ensuring the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of various leap forward plans.

The main content of this inspection team's in-depth inspection will be: to check the changes in the relationship between the Party and the masses, between cadres and the masses, and the changes in the "three styles" and "five airs" of the cadres after the rectification campaign. To check whether the cadres wholeheartedly rely on the masses, consult with the masses in everything, care about the thoughts, production, work, life and study of the masses, and integrate with the masses. To check the on-the-job labor participation, the transfer of cadres to lower levels, the service of management organizations to production, and the "destruction" and "establishment" of rules and regulations. To check the completion of various leap forward targets and the development of the technological revolution movement, to check whether the masses have been fully mobilized, whether it conforms to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, whether all means have been exhausted, self-reliance, overcoming difficulties, mutual cooperation, and striving to achieve leap forward targets, and to propose new leap forward plans. It is also necessary to check other outstanding problems that exist.

The inspection team will adopt the method of going from "reality" to "theory," grasping the key, and "one look, two questions, three talks, and four comparisons" when inspecting production and work in each unit. The inspection team will not only check the problems, experiences, and lessons existing in the grassroots great leap forward, but also try its best to help them solve the existing problems, and promote the grassroots cadres to continue to implement the spirit of rectification, deeply mobilize the masses, and make a further leap forward in the great leap forward.

The 10,000-person inspection team is organized into fifteen groups based on districts. Each group will conduct inspections based on the industrial structure of the districts, and adopt the method of "three combinations," namely: the municipal organization inspection team goes deep into the grassroots for inspection; when inspecting a unit, organize cadres and worker representatives from brother units in the same industry to participate in the inspection together; at the same time, mobilize the masses of the unit to put forward opinions and criticisms on the production and work of the unit through big-character posters, chat meetings, and organized inspection teams. Leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee will serve as the head and deputy head of the inspection team respectively.

    万人检查团以区为单位组织十五个团。各团按区分产业进行检查，并采取“三结合”的方法，即：市组织检查团深入基层进行检查；在检查一个单位的时候，组织这个单位同行业的兄弟单位的干部和职工代表一起参加检查；同时发动这个单位的群众以大字报、漫谈会、组织检查小组等方法，对本单位的生产和工作提出意见和批评。检查团由中共上海市委和上海市人民委员会的领导人分别担任团长、副团长。
