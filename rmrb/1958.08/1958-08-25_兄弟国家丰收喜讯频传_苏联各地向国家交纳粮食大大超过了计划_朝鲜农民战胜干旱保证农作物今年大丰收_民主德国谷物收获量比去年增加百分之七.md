(Dispatch from this newspaper in Moscow on the 24th) Soviet agricultural workers are enthusiastically launching a competition to do this year's grain harvest work quickly and well, and to sell more grain to the state. Many regions have completed and greatly exceeded the plan for delivering grain to the state ahead of schedule. Among them, the Stalingrad Oblast reported even better news. By August 18, this oblast had sold 100 million poods of grain (one pood equals 16.38 kilograms) to the state, nearly doubling the original plan of 55 million poods. However, the agricultural workers in the Stalingrad Oblast are not satisfied with this glorious victory, and they are enthusiastically striving to sell another 50 million poods of grain to the state.

This year, thanks to the high enthusiasm of agricultural workers in various parts of the Soviet Union, the full utilization of agricultural machinery, and the comprehensive implementation of advanced staged harvesting methods, the speed of harvesting has been greatly accelerated, and grain losses have been significantly reduced. As of August 20, 66,346,000 hectares of land throughout the Soviet Union (58.3% of the total sown area) had been completely harvested. Among them, the Russian Federal Republic had harvested 40,350,000 hectares, accounting for 58% of the sown area.

The harvesting work in the vast eastern regions of the Soviet Union has also entered a tense stage. In Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Altai Territory, tens of thousands of local agricultural workers and workers and students who have come from other places to provide assistance are going all out to carry out the tense harvesting. Agricultural workers in the Kazakh Republic are striving to harvest grain without losses. The agricultural workers of this republic guarantee to sell one billion poods of grain to the state. The latest news from Alma-Ata, the capital of this republic, said that the first batch of 20 million poods of harvested grain has been sent to the state granary.

The grains of most state farms and collective farms in Siberia and the Altai Territory are growing very well. Agricultural workers in these two regions are effectively organizing the harvesting work. In order to shorten the harvesting period, rapid staged harvesting has been almost fully implemented here, and the harvesting efficiency in some areas has doubled compared with previous years. Many combine operators in the Altai Territory harvest more than 70 hectares per day, which is a rare achievement.

(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd) This year, various grains and cash crops such as rice, corn, cotton, tobacco, and flax in Korea are growing particularly well. Farmers say that they have never seen such good crops this year. Responsible cadres of the Ministry of Agriculture said that if there are no unexpected circumstances, a bumper harvest can be guaranteed this year.

Such a good year is what Korean farmers have won after overcoming a rare drought this year. The rainfall in the first eight months of this year was only about half of the normal year. Especially in May and June, when it was the time for sowing and transplanting rice seedlings and for crop growth, there was no rain in most areas of northern Korea. Farmers, students, soldiers, and cadres of institutions from all over the country formed a large army to fight drought, worked hard for more than 20 days and nights, and contributed more than 6.6 million workdays to irrigate the 200,000 chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu) area planted with cotton and corn two to three times. In addition, the large-scale water conservancy projects built in Korea after the war have enabled 90% of the paddy fields to be irrigated, ensuring the planting and growth of rice in the event of drought. As a result, this year's various crops have been hardly affected by the drought.

An important reason why rice is growing particularly well in Korea this year is that seedlings cultivated by the "cold bed seedling method" were used in more than half of the rice paddies, so that these rice paddies were transplanted a month earlier than usual. Now, this rice has grown to chest height. The 31 chongbo of rice paddy in the Dasong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gangnam County, South Pyongan Province, is expected to yield 12 tons per chongbo. More than double the original plan.

Corn, which accounts for the largest proportion of the sown area in dry land, is also growing very well this year. The more than 400 chongbo of corn in the Samryong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sunchon County, South Pyongan Province, is all two people tall, and the average yield per chongbo is expected to reach six tons.

South Pyongan Province alone is expected to harvest 800,000 tons of grain this year, an increase of 270,000 tons compared with before the war.

Farmers in various parts of northern Korea planted cotton in 70% of the cotton fields this year using the nutrient jar false planting method. Many old farmers said that such good cotton is the first time in the history of cotton planting in Korea.

(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 23rd) This year, the German Democratic Republic has generally achieved a bumper harvest of grain. Experts from the Ministry of Agriculture told Xinhua reporters that, according to preliminary estimates, this year's grain harvest will increase by at least 7% compared with last year, and the average yield per hectare of various grains (including rye, wheat, oats, etc.) will increase by 180 kilograms compared with last year (last year's average yield per hectare was 2,330 kilograms).

At present, the harvesting work in more than 2.5 million hectares of wheat fields across the country is nearing completion, and the vast fields are piled with golden and fruitful grains. Due to recent rains, male and female students from universities and colleges across the country have gone to the countryside to help farmers rush to harvest. In many areas, machine tractor stations have also implemented a two-shift system and assembly line operation method, dispatching combine harvesters day and night.

In order to help farmers thresh and store grain, sow late-maturing crops in time, and prepare for the harvesting of corn and potatoes, today the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, the National Council of the National Front, and the Presidium of the Federation of Free German Trade Unions issued a joint appeal, requiring institutions, schools, enterprises, and urban residents to generally go to the countryside to support rural areas.

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hans Reichelt said in an interview with reporters that this year's bumper grain harvest is a good start to achieving the main economic goals stipulated by the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in agricultural production, and has created favorable conditions for a larger harvest next year.

　　兄弟国家丰收喜讯频传
    苏联各地向国家交纳粮食大大超过了计划
    朝鲜农民战胜干旱保证农作物今年大丰收
    民主德国谷物收获量比去年增加百分之七
    本报莫斯科24日电　苏联农业劳动者热情蓬勃展开竞赛，要把今年的谷物收割工作，做得又快又好，向国家交售更多的粮食。许多地区都提前和大大超额完成了向国家交售粮食的计划。其中，斯大林格勒州报来了更大的喜讯。这个州到8月18日止，已向国家交售了一亿普特谷物（一普特等于十六点三八公斤），比原定计划五千五百万普特增加了将近一倍。但是，斯大林格勒州农业劳动者们并不满足于这一光辉的胜利，他们正热情地为再向国家交售五千万普特粮食而努力。
    今年苏联各地由于农业劳动者生产热情高涨和充分利用农业机器以及全面执行先进的分段收割法，收割工作的速度大大加快，而且粮食损耗显著减少。到8月20日为止，全苏有六千六百三十四万六千公顷土地（占全部播种面积的58.3％）已全部收割完毕。其中俄罗斯联邦共和国已收割了四千零三十五万公顷，占播种面积的58％。
    苏联东部广大地区的收割工作也已进入紧张阶段。在哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚和阿尔泰边疆区，成千上万的当地农业劳动者和外地前来支援的工人、学生，正在全力以赴地进行紧张收割。哈萨克共和国农业劳动者正在努力争取不受损耗地收割粮食。这个共和国的农业劳动者保证交售给国家十亿普特粮食。从这个共和国首都阿拉木图得来的最新消息说，头一批收割的粮食二千万普特，已送入国家粮仓了。
    西伯利亚和阿尔泰边疆区大多数国营农场和集体农庄的谷物都长得很好。这两个地区的农业劳动者正在有效地组织收割工作。为了缩短收割期，这里几乎已全部推行了快速分段收割法，部分地区已把收割效率比往年提高了一倍。阿尔泰边疆区的许多联合收割机手每日收割量达到七十多公顷，这样的收割成绩是很少有的。
    新华社平壤22日电　今年朝鲜的水稻、玉蜀黍、棉花、烟草、亚麻等各种谷物和经济作物都生长得特别好。农民们说，从来没有见过今年这样好的庄稼；农业省的负责干部说，如果不发生意外情况，今年可保大丰收。
    这样的好年成是朝鲜农民今年战胜了稀有的干旱后赢得的。今年头八个月的雨量大约只有常年的一半，特别是5、6月间正值播种插秧和农作物生长的时候，朝鲜北部大部分地区没有下雨。各地的农民、学生、军队、机关干部组成了抗旱大军，苦战二十多个昼夜，共出了六百六十多万个工，在种植棉花和玉蜀黍等作物的二十万町步（每町步约合十五市亩）面积上浇了两次到三次水。另外，朝鲜在战后大量兴修的水利，使90％的水田得到灌溉，保证了水稻在干旱情况下的种植和生长。这样一来，今年的各种农作物几乎没有受到干旱的影响。
    今年朝鲜水稻生长得特别好的一个重要原因，是由于一半以上的水稻采用了“冷床育苗法”培育的秧苗，使这些水田较常年提前一个月插完了秧。现在，这种水稻长到齐胸高。平安南道江南郡大松农业生产合作社的三十一町步水田，预计每町步的产量可达十二吨。超过原订计划一倍多。
    在旱田中播种面积比重占最大的玉蜀黍，今年长得也很好。平安南道顺川郡三龙农业生产合作社的四百多町步玉蜀黍都长得有两人高，预计平均每町步产量可达六吨。
    平安南道一个道今年就预计能收八十万吨粮食，比战前增产二十七万吨。
    朝鲜北部各地的农民今年在70％的棉田里用营养坛假植法种了棉花。许多老农说，这样好的棉花在朝鲜植棉历史上还是第一次。
    新华社柏林23日电　今年民主德国的谷物普遍获得丰收。农业部的专家对新华社记者说，据初步估计，今年的谷物收获量比去年至少增加7％以上，各种谷物（包括裸麦小麦燕麦等）的平均单位面积产量每公顷比去年增产一百八十公斤（去年的每公顷平均产量是二千三百三十公斤）。
    目前全国二百五十多万公顷麦田里的收割工作已经接近尾声，广阔的田野里堆积着金黄色的丰硕的谷物。由于近日多雨，全国各地高等学校的男女学生们纷纷下乡帮助农民抢收，许多地区的机器拖拉机站也实行两班制和流水作业法，日夜出动联合收割机。
    为了帮助农民们打禾入仓、及时播种晚期作物并为玉米和薯类的收割工作做好准备，今天德意志民主共和国部长会议、民主德国全国阵线全国委员会和自由德国工会联合会理事会发出了一项联合号召，要求机关、学校、企业和城市居民普遍地下乡支援农村。
    农林部长汉斯·赖歇耳特对记者们发表谈话时说，今年谷物的丰收是在农业生产上实现德国统一社会党第五次代表大会所规定的主要经济目标的良好的开端，并且为明年更大的丰收创造了有利条件。
