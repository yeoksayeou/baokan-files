Shanxi Criticizes Complacency and Slackening Thoughts
Shaanxi Launches Field Comparison Movement

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee recently convened a meeting of Party secretaries from prefectures, cities, and counties to arrange three important current tasks: vigorously carrying out a concentrated effort on autumn field post-management processing, agricultural tool reform, and winter wheat sowing preparations.

Currently, autumn crops throughout the province are generally growing well. However, some cadres and farmers have developed a complacent attitude, believing that this year's crops are growing better than any previous year, and that a good harvest is assured whether or not post-processing is carried out. The meeting launched a criticism against this kind of thinking and further discussed the current situation of the Great Leap Forward. The meeting held that the most important tasks in autumn field post-processing are topdressing, inter-row cultivation and weeding, and pest and disease control, with topdressing as the central focus among the three main tasks. All possible means should be used to strive to achieve the requirement of applying 10,000 jin of topdressing per mu.

The meeting held that the agricultural tool reform movement is a decisive link in the development of productive forces. The meeting proposed that the tool reform movement should be pushed to a high tide in August, and that the province should basically achieve semi-mechanization by the end of September.

The meeting requested that preparations for sowing wheat be done well in August and September.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: After the meeting of six-level cadres in Shaanxi Province, a field inspection and comparison movement to remove the white flags of low yield and insert the red flags of high yield is being widely launched.

In many areas, during the great debate to launch inspection and comparison, it was discovered that because autumn and cotton fields in various parts of Shaanxi are generally growing well this year, with a good harvest expected, some cadres and farmers have become complacent. They believe that the autumn harvest is already "a foregone conclusion" and that "post-management can only prevent yield reduction and cannot increase yield," and so on. Because of complacency and waiting for a good harvest, some places have tightened autumn field management at the beginning but relaxed it later.

Now, large-scale field inspections and comparisons are being carried out throughout Shaanxi Province. The "foregone conclusion" theory has been severely criticized.

After checking each plot and each plant, the inspection teams in various places immediately decided to take measures to strengthen management, and the movement to remove low-yield white flags and insert high-yield red flags has been launched in the inspection of each plot.

### 秋田后期加工大有可为

　　秋田后期加工大有可为
　　山西批判松劲自满思想
　  陕西开展田间评比运动
    据新华社讯　中共山西省委最近召开了地、市、县委书记会议，布置了当前三项重要任务：大力突击秋田后期管理加工、农具改革和冬小麦播种准备工作。
    目前，全省秋季作物普遍生长良好。有些干部和农民却产生“差不多了”的自满思想，认为今年的庄稼比过去任何一年都长得好，后期加工不加工，丰收不成问题。会议针对这种思想展开了批判，并且对当前大跃进的形势进一步作了讨论。会议认为，秋田后期加工最主要的任务是追肥、中耕锄草和防治病虫害，三项主要任务中又以追肥为中心。要想尽一切办法，力争实现亩施追肥万斤的要求。
    会议认为，农具改革运动是发展生产力的决定环节。会议提出8月份要把工具改革运动推向高潮，9月底全省要基本实现半机械化。
    会议要求8、9两月做好种麦的准备工作。
    据新华社讯　陕西省六级干部会师田间后，一个拔低产白旗、插高产红旗的田间检查评比运动正广泛展开。
    许多地区在发动检查评比的大辩论中发现，由于今年陕西各地秋田、棉田普遍生长良好，丰收有望，因而一部分干部和农民有自满情绪。他们认为秋收已经“定局”，认为“后期管理只能防止减产，不能增产”等等。因为自满坐等丰收，有些地方秋田管理前紧后松。
    现在陕西省各地普遍在进行田间的大规模检查评比。狠狠地批判了“定局论”。
    各地检查团逐块逐株检查后，立即决心采取措施加强管理，各地逐块检查中开展了拔低产白旗、插高产红旗的运动。
