Reader's words:

　　Don't Use Medical Personnel to Scare Children
    Some parents often use medical personnel as a tool to scare children. When a child cries, they say, "If you cry again, I'll call the doctor to give you a shot." Injections and medicine are important measures for treating diseases. However, because parents often scare children, it increases the child's psychological burden, causing some children to be uncooperative during medical examinations. More seriously, some children hide when they see a doctor entering the village. Such intimidation of children is very inappropriate.

　　不要用医务人员吓儿童
    有些作父母的，常把医务人员作为恐吓儿童的工具。儿童一哭，就说：“再哭，叫医生给你打针”。打针、吃药是治疗疾病的重要措施。但是，由于父母经常对儿童恐吓，加重了儿童的心理负担，致使有些儿童在诊病时很不合作，更严重的是，有些儿童一看到医生进村，就躲避了。这样的恐吓儿童，是非常不妥当的。浙江普陀虾峙卫生所　王炬卿
