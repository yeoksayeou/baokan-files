    Gaoyou's Schistosomiasis Prevention Work is Well Done
    The Number of People Getting Sick This Year has Greatly Decreased
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, vigorously carries out schistosomiasis prevention work, ensuring the victorious completion of this year's summer lake grass cutting task. A total of 11,000 people from five townships participating in grass cutting cut more than 50 million catties of grass in one month. During the grass cutting process, only a little over 100 people were found to have mild suspected infection symptoms, and no cases of true infection or acute infection were found.
    Gaoyou County's good schistosomiasis prevention work this year is the result of learning from the lessons of the past few years. The county borders Gaoyou Lake. Xinmin Township, which straddles the lake beach, is rich in green grass, which is one of the main sources of fertilizer in the county. Every year, starting from early summer, farmers from Xinmin, Cheluo, Kaihe, Wu'an and other townships come to the lake beach to harvest green grass, harvesting three times a year to supply farmers in thirteen townships with fertilizer for more than 100,000 mu of farmland. However, because the lake beach is densely populated with snails, the situation of people cutting lake grass being infected with schistosomiasis was very serious. In 1950 alone, 1,006 people died of schistosomiasis in Xinmin Township alone. The Gaoyou County Committee of the Communist Party of China launched schistosomiasis prevention and control work among the masses of the county starting in 1951. However, due to the wide distribution of snails and the limitations of swampy areas, the snails were not eliminated. Moreover, the masses did not pay enough attention to prevention work. In 1956, 1,390 people were infected with schistosomiasis, of which 381 were acute cases. Among these infected people, many were repeat infections.
    This matter aroused the attention of the Gaoyou County Party Committee, and it began to strengthen its leadership in prevention work starting in 1957. Especially this year, in order to meet the requirements of the great leap forward in agricultural production and to supply a large amount of green manure to farmland, the number of people organized to cut grass in the lake beach has increased more than twofold compared with previous years, and the Gaoyou County Party Committee has paid more attention to prevention work. Since April this year, the County Party Committee has established a summer grass cutting safety protection headquarters, and the County Party Committee Secretary personally took charge of this work. The Party Committee Secretaries, Township heads, cooperative chairmen and production team leaders of each township personally led the masses to the lake beach to cut grass, and health protection personnel also followed the grass cutting teams to the site to provide technical guidance on protection. At the same time, propaganda was carried out targeting the fear among the masses and the paralysis of some people, using wired broadcasts, county newspapers, commune member meetings, schistosomiasis prevention and control work touring exhibitions, etc., and debates were conducted on issues such as "Should schistosomiasis be prevented?" and "Can prevention work be done well?". Through publicity and debate, the masses further understood the significance of prevention work, universally formulated five conventions for doing a good job in prevention work, and came up with many effective prevention measures for cutting grass on dry beaches. When the water rose, they cut the low beach grass first, and then the high beach grass. When the water rose, they grabbed the high beach grass and abandoned the low beach grass; people who often cut grass in epidemic water purchased more than 2,300 pairs of old cloth boots, and those who did not have boots applied protective ointment when entering the water. During the work in the lake beach, they also brought pots and stoves, foot washing basins, drank boiled water, washed their feet with hot water; brought manure buckets, dug dry toilet pits, and managed the manure well. Because this prevention work was done well, not only was the safety of the grass cutters protected, but it also promoted the masses to further improve prevention work, laying the foundation for doing a good job in collective protection and personal protection during sideline production such as water conservancy and catching fish and shrimp in the summer and autumn.

    高邮血吸虫病防护工作做得好
    今年得病的人大大减少
    本报讯　江苏省高邮县大力开展防护血吸虫病的工作，保证胜利完成今年夏季割湖草的任务。全县五个乡参加割草的一万一千人，一个月共割草五千多万斤。在割草过程中，只发现一百多人有轻度疑似的感染症状，没有发现有真正感染和急性感染的症状。
    高邮县今年割湖草的防护工作做得好，是接受过去几年教训的结果。该县滨高邮湖。跨湖滩上的新民乡，盛产青草，为该县肥料的主要来源之一。每年从夏初开始，新民、车逻、开河、武安等乡农民，即来湖滩收割青草，每年割三次，以供给十三个乡农民解决十多万亩的肥料问题。但由于湖滩密布钉螺，割湖草的人感染上血吸虫病的情况很严重。1950年，单是新民一乡死于血吸虫病的即达一千零六人。中共高邮县委从1951年起，发动全县群众开展血吸虫病防治工作。但是由于钉螺分布的地面广，以及湖沼地带的条件限制，没有把钉螺消灭。而群众对防护工作又重视不够，1956年还有一千三百九十人感染了血吸虫病，其中急性发作的即有三百八十一人。在这些感染的人中，有不少都是重复感染。
    这事引起高邮县委的重视，从1957年起即开始加强对防护工作的领导。特别是今年，为了适应农业生产大跃进的要求，要供给农田大量绿肥，组织下湖滩割草的人比往年增加了两倍以上，高邮县委对防护工作更加重视。今年自4月起，县委即建立了夏季割草安全防护指挥部，县委书记亲自掌握这一工作，各乡党委书记、乡长、社长和生产队长，都亲自带领群众上湖滩割草，卫生防护人员也跟着割草队到现场进行防护技术指导。同时，针对群众中的畏惧思想和一部分人的麻痹思想，利用有线广播、县报、社员大会、血吸虫病防治工作巡回展览等，进行了宣传，并对“血吸虫病应不应该防护”“能不能防护得好”等问题进行了辩论。经过宣传和辩论，群众进一步了解了防护工作的意义，普遍订出了做好防护工作的五项公约，想出了在干滩割草和许多有效的防护措施。他们在水涨时，先割低滩草，后割高滩草，水向上涨时，即抢割高滩草，放弃低滩草；经常下疫水割草的人，购置了二千三百多双旧布靴子，没有靴子的人下水时，都涂抹了防护药膏等。在湖滩工作期间，还带去锅灶、洗脚盆，喝开水，用热水洗脚；带了粪桶，挖土茅厕坑，把粪便管理好。由于这次防护工作做得好，不但保护了割草人的安全，而且促使群众进一步做好防护工作，为在夏秋季搞水利、捉鱼虾等副业生产时，做好集体防护和个人防护打下了基础。
