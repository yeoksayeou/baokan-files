　　Good Work Done in Changge County's Work-Study Program: Can Read, Can Farm, Can Make Steel
　　(Our newspaper, reporter Chen Jian reported) The work-study program in the seven public middle schools in Changge County, except for Changge No. 3 Middle School which started earlier, all began this year. Currently, these seven middle schools all have their own indigenous iron and steel plants, chemical plants and fertilizer plants, and large areas of experimental fields. These are all production internship bases for the schools. Some schools have more than 30 kinds of self-service sideline production and welfare production. Walking into these schools is like entering a small society. These schools all raise chickens, ducks, bees, fish, sheep, rabbits, silkworms, etc. The schools have canteens, bathrooms, laundry groups, sewing groups, mending, shoe repair groups, barber groups, etc. Students also make chalk, paste, toothpaste, and masks. Every student here understands the complete knowledge of several major crops such as wheat, corn, cotton, and sweet potatoes from plowing to harvesting, and has a preliminary grasp of the basic knowledge and skills of iron and woodworking. Students can read, farm, and make steel. In the morning, they study academic subjects. After two classes in the afternoon, they engage in production labor and research in the experimental fields. In the evening, they conduct production internships by the roaring furnace. Recently, Changge No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Middle Schools have obtained the consent of Yuxian County to jointly establish a steel plant in Tiegashang there. Students will take turns to practice, and they also plan to move the classroom to Tiegashang.
　　With so many production labor activities, will it affect students' learning, reduce teaching quality, or even affect students' health? The seven public middle schools in Changge County answered this question affirmatively with excellent results this summer. The students' exam questions were completely based on the provisions and requirements of the central Ministry of Education's teaching syllabus. This year, the county's secondary schools eliminated repeat students, and the number of students with an average score of five or four in each subject increased by 20% to 30% compared with last year. This is the most powerful proof of improved teaching quality. The teaching of all courses in these schools is almost integrated with production labor and practice. Physics and chemistry classes are combined with agricultural tool reform, inventions and creations, and self-run factories for teaching; biology classes are combined with deep plowing of land and experimental fields for teaching. The teaching of Chinese, history, and geography in these schools is combined with a large number of folk legends, allegro poems in the Great Leap Forward, the geographical and historical conditions of Changge County, the heinous crimes committed by the Kuomintang and Tang Enbo here, and a comparative survey of the changes in the economic life of a commune and a village before and after liberation. This kind of learning method greatly improved the teaching quality and students' class consciousness. The students said: "Teaching combined with physical labor, linked with reality, makes the brain clear, memory strong, imagination active, and understanding profound. In the past, before exams, we memorized, recited, and copied, staying up for several days and nights, and then forgot everything in the end." The students' Chinese proficiency has also been greatly improved. Because they participated in production labor and increased their perceptual knowledge, they have a correct view of the working people. Therefore, their compositions and diaries can truly reflect their love for labor and the working people.
　　After the implementation of the work-study program, students' ideological feelings of loving labor, loving workers and peasants, and loving the countryside have been cultivated, a new atmosphere of hard work and simplicity has been established, they have a correct view of their future, and their class consciousness has also been improved. This year, nearly 700 junior high school graduates from Changge No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Middle Schools all have three wishes: one is to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, the second is to develop the virgin land in remote areas of the motherland, and the third is to resolutely obey the organization's assignments. One student said that as long as the Party says a word, they will do whatever they are asked to do. The school mobilized a small number of graduates to go to Xinjiang, and 98% of them signed up. In the past, at this time, from the county to the school, special institutions had to be set up to do a lot of ideological work for the students, but now it is no longer needed. There was a female student in No. 1 Middle School named Lu Xiumei, who was spoiled since childhood and did not work. Her mother worked to support her schooling. In the past, when her mother came to the school to see her, she was afraid that people would laugh at her mother's poor clothes, and told her classmates that she was an aunt from the next yard. The work-study program made this girl an activist in labor. She told her classmates what was in her heart and brought her mother to the school to visit. Changge No. 3 Middle School, the earliest and best in implementing the work-study program, last summer, when the graduates of their neighboring schools were in a flurry over further education and employment, the graduates of No. 3 Middle School were admitted to high schools in various parts of Henan with the highest proportion in the entire region, and the rest of the students happily went to agricultural cooperatives to participate in production. Two months later, the Party branch of this school conducted a survey in the agricultural cooperatives where the students were located. Eighty-two out of two hundred and twenty people became models, fifty-nine became Youth League branch secretaries and private school teachers, forty-three became accountants, and two became commune leaders. At the various labor model or activist representative conferences in Changge County, students from No. 3 Middle School can be seen. Through work-study activities, the physical fitness of teachers and students in various schools has been generally enhanced, and neurasthenia, bone pain, and stomach diseases have been basically eliminated. Touching stories of unity, friendship, and mutual support between teachers, between teachers and students, and between schools and agricultural cooperatives have spread throughout the county.

　　会读书　会务农　会炼钢铁
    长葛县的勤工俭学运动做得好
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：长葛县七所公立中学的勤工俭学运动，除长葛三中开展的较早外，其他都是今年开始的。目前这七所中学都已经有了自己的土制炼铁厂和炼钢厂，有化工厂和化肥厂，有大片面积的试验田，这些都是各校的生产实习基地。有些学校自我服务性的副业生产和福利生产有三十多种。走进这些学校，宛如进入一个小小的社会。这几个学校都养有鸡、鸭、蜂、鱼、羊、兔、蚕等，学校里有食堂、浴室、洗衣组、缝纫组、补衣、补鞋组、理发组等。学生们还制造粉笔、浆糊、牙膏、口罩。这里的每个学生都懂得小麦、玉米、棉花、红薯等几种主要农作物从翻地到收获的全套知识，初步掌握了铁、木工的起码知识和技术。学生们会读书，会务农，也会炼钢铁。他们上午是学科学习，下午上两节课以后，就在试验田里生产劳动和研究，晚上又在熊熊的火炉旁进行生产实习。最近，长葛一、二、三中得到禹县的同意，准备联合在那里的铁尕上建立炼钢厂，学生轮班去实习，还准备把课堂也搬到铁尕上。
    有这么多的生产劳动活动，会不会影响学生的学习，减低教学质量，甚至影响学生们的健康呢？长葛县七所公立中学今年暑期用优异的成绩肯定地回答了这个问题。学生们考试的题目完全根据中央教育部教学大纲的规定和要求订出的，今年全县中等学校消灭了留级生，学科平均五分、四分的学生比去年增加20％到30％，这是教学质量提高的最有力的证明。这些学校所有的课程的教学几乎都结合生产劳动和实习。物理、化学课就结合农具改革、发明创造、自己办的工厂来进行教学；生物课就结合深翻土地、试验田来进行教学。这些学校的语文、历史、地理课教学结合了大量的民间传说、大跃进中的快板诗歌、长葛县的地理、历史情况，国民党、汤恩伯在这里造下的滔天罪行，以及进行一个社、一个村解放前后经济生活变化的对比调查等。这样的学习方法，大大提高了教学质量和学生的阶级觉悟。学生们说：“教学结合体力劳动，联系实际，使脑子清楚，记忆力强，想像力活跃，理解深刻。过去在考试前，又记又背，又抄，熬了几天几夜，临了全忘完了。”学生们的语文水平也大大提高了，由于他们参加生产劳动，增加了感性知识，对劳动人民有了正确的看法，因此，作文和日记里都能真切地反映出对劳动和劳动人民的热爱。
    实行勤工俭学以后，培养了学生热爱劳动、热爱工农、热爱农村的思想感情，树立了艰苦朴素的新风气，对自己的前途有了正确的看法，也提高了阶级觉悟。今年，长葛一、二、三中的近七百名初中毕业生都有三个志愿，一是回农村参加农业生产，二是开发祖国边远的处女地，三是坚决服从组织分配。一个学生说，只要党说一句话，叫干啥就干啥。学校动员一小部分毕业生去新疆，98％的人报了名。过去，每到这个时候，从县里到学校都要设立专门机构对学生做许多思想工作，现在就不需要了。一中有个女学生叫路秀梅，从小娇生惯养，不劳动，她母亲劳动供她读书。过去，她的母亲到学校来看她时，她怕人笑话母亲穿的不好，对同学说是隔院大婶。勤工俭学使这女孩子成了劳动积极分子，她向同学说出了心里话，并且把母亲领到学校里来参观。勤工俭学最早最好的长葛三中，去年暑期，当他们的邻校毕业生为了升学就业闹得不可开交的时候，三中的毕业生以全专区最高的比例数考进了河南各地的高级中学，其余的学生都愉快地到农业社参加生产。两个月以后，这个学校的党支部在学生所在的农业社进行了一次调查，二百二十人中有八十二人当了模范，五十九人当了团支部书记和民校教师，四十三人当了会计，两人当社长。在长葛县的各种劳动模范或积极分子代表大会上，都能看到三中的学生，通过勤工俭学活动，各校师生的体质普遍增强，神经衰弱、骨疼病、胃病都基本上消灭了。教员之间、师生之间、学校与农业社之间的团结、友爱、互相支援的感人故事，传遍全县。
