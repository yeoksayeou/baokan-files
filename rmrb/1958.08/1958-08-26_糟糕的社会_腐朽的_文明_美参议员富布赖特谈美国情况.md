Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 23rd: Senator Fulbright, who recently strongly criticized American foreign policy, delivered another speech in the Senate, reiterating that American foreign policy must be fundamentally revised. He said that he believes the problem is not only that "our foreign policy is terrible," but more "fundamentally, our society is terrible." Fulbright's words essentially touched upon the corruption of the entire American social system. He expressed concern about how this system could avoid collapsing under the "challenge" of the Soviet Union.

Fulbright expressed open unease about the one-sided development of American society. He said that in this society, "education is neglected, and sound reasoning becomes a cause for suspicion"; in this society, "social activists, writers, or teachers who dare to express a unique idea will be accused of subversive activities. Here, anyone who has two fancy cars, a swimming pool, untaxed accounts, and a twenty-one-inch fluorescent screen television is a celebrity."

Fulbright expressed his anxiety about the spiritual poverty and lack of lofty ideals in modern America. Fulbright's remarks are in stark contrast to Dulles's claims. Dulles insisted that the Soviet system was strong in appearance but weak in reality, while Fulbright said that Western "civilization" was nothing more than "gilded garbage." He said, "Once this civilization encounters an irresistible challenge, its outer shell will be destroyed."

Fulbright worried that the United States would suffer a fate similar to that of the Roman Empire. He advocated for a complete change in "the valuation of social and cultural wealth."

　　糟糕的社会　腐朽的“文明”
    美参议员富布赖特谈美国情况
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿23日讯：不久前曾经猛烈抨击美国外交政策的参议员富布赖特最近又在参议院发表演说，重申必须根本修改美国政府的外交政策，并且说，他认为问题不仅在于“我们的外交政策很糟糕”，而且更“基本的是，我们的社会很糟糕”。富布赖特的话实质上触及了美国整个社会制度的腐败问题。他表示担心，这个制度怎样才能不致在苏联的“挑战”下崩溃。
    富布赖特对美国社会的片面发展表示公开的不安。他说，这个社会中“教育被荒废，优良的理性会变成引起猜疑的原因”；在这个社会中，“社会活动家、作家或者教师，如果他们胆敢发表一点独特的思想，就会被指责为颠覆活动。这里，只要谁有两部漂亮的小汽车，有游泳池，有不上税的帐目，有二十一吋莹光屏的电视机，谁就是名人”。
    富布赖特表示，他对现代美国这种精神上的贫乏状况和缺乏某种崇高理想的现象感到焦虑。富布赖特的说法同杜勒斯的说法正好形成了鲜明的对比。杜勒斯硬说苏联制度是外强中干，富布赖特则说西方“文明”不过是“金玉其外，败絮其中”。他说，“一旦这种文明碰到无法抵抗的挑战，它的那层外壳就会被摧毁。”
    富布赖特担心美国会遭到同罗马帝国相类似的命运。他主张要在“对社会和文化财富的估价上”彻底进行改变。
