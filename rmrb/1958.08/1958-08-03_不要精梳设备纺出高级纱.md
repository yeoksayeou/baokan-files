    Spinning High-Grade Yarn Without Combing Equipment
    (Our dispatch) The Qingfeng Textile Factory in Wuxi City has recently successfully tested a high-speed fine yarn centrifugal spindle. With this spindle, without combing equipment, they spun 440-count high-grade yarn using ordinary cotton. The 440-count high-grade yarn is only one-sixth the thickness of a human hair and can be used to weave fabrics as soft and beautiful as silk.
    This major innovation was successfully tested by Yin Liren, a young technician at the Qingfeng Textile Factory, Wang Huai, a technician at the Wuxi Textile Research Institute, and veteran workers.
    Old technical theories held that high-grade yarn required combing equipment and high-grade cotton; ordinary cotton could only spin 65-count yarn. Now, the employees of the Qingfeng Textile Factory have shattered this outdated theory with their bold and daring actions. (Wuxi Daily Editorial Department)

    不要精梳设备纺出高级纱
    本报讯　无锡市庆丰纺织厂最近试验成功一种高速细纱离心式锭子。这种锭子上，没有精梳设备，但用普通棉花，纺出了440支高级纱。440支高级纱只有头发丝的六分之一那么细，可以用来织成同绸子一样柔软而美观的布匹。
    这一重大革新，是庆丰纺织厂的青年技术员殷立人、无锡市纺织试验研究所技术员王槐和老工人们一起试验成功的。
    旧的技术理论认为：纺高级纱必须要有精梳设备，用高级棉；普通棉只能纺65支纱。现在，庆丰纺织厂的职工用自己敢想敢干的行动打破了这种陈腐理论。（无锡日报编辑部）
