Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 2nd (by our correspondent Chen Bojian) – Over the past ten days or so, the most profound feeling I've had in this newly established republic is the strong friendly feelings of the Iraqi people, who have overthrown the imperialist proxy regime, towards the People's China. Everywhere I am greeted with friendly smiles and enthusiastic hands extended to me.

I recall that the moment I stepped onto Iraqi soil, I felt that the friendship towards China, which the Iraqi people who had gained freedom after the revolution could not express before, had also been liberated. On July 23rd, after traveling for twenty-six hours in the desert, I arrived in the first small town in Iraq called Ruba. Suddenly, the chief of the Ruba County Police Bureau invited us – my friend from the German Democratic Republic and me – to his office. We thought it might be related to our passport issues. But later we discovered that he simply wanted to specially entertain us and express his welcome. I conveyed to him the Chinese people's support for the Iraqi revolution. I told him that, to my knowledge, more than ten million Chinese people had held demonstrations to express their support for the Iraqi revolution. The police chief said he was very happy that he was the first official to receive guests from a friendly country. He said that before the revolution, Iraq was isolated from all peace-loving and friendly countries. He expressed gratitude to the Chinese and German people for their support.

When I arrived in the capital, Baghdad, I could see and feel the friendly feelings of the Iraqi people towards People's China everywhere. I saw that the people already regarded Chiang Kai-shek as an enemy just like the Iraqi traitor Nuri al-Said. They said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "representatives" could no longer be allowed to be stationed in Iraq, and demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "ambassador" be driven out.

When I was walking on the street, people often asked me to stop and asked if I was Chinese. When I told them I was Chinese, they immediately shook my hand enthusiastically. One day, I went to the telegraph office to send a telegram, and a worker specially invited me to drink soda. Although we did not understand each other's language, we silently exchanged our friendly wishes. Once, a businessman inquired about how to import fans and other goods from China. He said, "The climate" has changed, so Iraq will be able to find ways to strengthen trade and other relations with China in the future.

On the several nights I spent on the banks of the Tigris River, I was often surrounded by a group of enthusiastic Iraqi friends. Every table invited me to sit with them. Sometimes, before I could get to their table, they rushed up and sat with me.

I have met many young people. Although their old regime did not allow them to understand the situation in China and blocked news about China, I found that they knew quite a bit about China. Now they understand the situation in China even more, and many young people hope to get Chinese books. They pay close attention to China's development and progress. Many people hope to have the opportunity to visit China.

Countless vivid facts prove that the Iraqi people, who have broken free from the shackles imposed on them by imperialism, universally hope to strengthen the friendship between the two peoples.

    打破了帝国主义枷锁的伊拉克人民
    普遍要求加强中伊人民友谊
    新华社巴格达2日电　本社记者陈伯坚报道：十几天来，记者在这个新成立的共和国里最深刻的一个感受，就是推翻了帝国主义代理人政权的伊拉克人民对人民中国的强烈友好感情。到处迎接我的是友好的笑容和向我伸出来的热情的手。
    我回想起，当我一踏进伊拉克领土的时候，我就感觉到，在革命以后获得了自由的伊拉克人民，在以前所不能表达的对中国的友谊也已经解放了。在7月23日，我在沙漠中走了二十六小时以后，到达伊拉克的名叫鲁巴的第一个小城镇。忽然，鲁巴的县警察局长请我们——我的德意志民主共和国的朋友和我——到他的办公处去。我们以为也许是同我们的护照问题有关。但是后来我们发现，他只是为了特别要招待我们，向我们表示欢迎。我向他转达了中国人民对伊拉克革命的支持。我告诉他说，就我所知，已经有一千多万中国人民举行了示威，来表示他们对伊拉克革命的支持。这位警察局长说，他对于自己是第一个接待来自友好国家的客人的官员感到很高兴。他说，在革命以前，伊拉克是同各爱好和平和友好的国家隔绝的。他表示感谢中国人民和德国人民对他们的支持。
    当我到达首都巴格达的时候，更是到处可以看到和感受到伊拉克人民对人民中国的友好感情。我看到人民已经把蒋介石看作同伊拉克的卖国贼努里·赛义德和伊拉一样的敌人。他们表示，不能够再让蒋介石集团的“代表”驻在伊拉克了，并且要求把蒋介石集团的“大使”赶走。
    当我在街上散步的时候，经常有人请我站住，问我是不是中国人。当我告诉他们我是中国人的时候，他们就立即热情地跟我握手。有一天，我到电报局去拍电报，一个工人特别请我去喝汽水，虽然我们的语言互不相通，但是我们互相表示友好的愿望却默默地交流着。有一次，一个商界人士向我打听怎样从中国进口扇子和其他货物。他说：“气候”已经改变了，因此，以后伊拉克能够设法加强同中国的贸易和其他关系了。
    我在底格里斯河畔度过的好几个夜晚里，经常有一群热情的伊拉克朋友围在我的四周。每个桌子都邀请我去跟他们坐在一起。有的时候，我还来不及到他们的桌子上去，他们就赶上来跟我坐在一起了。
    我会晤过许多青年人，虽然他们的旧政权不允许他们了解中国的情况，封锁了关于中国的消息，但是我发现他们对中国却是相当了解的。现在他们对中国的情形了解得更多了，许多青年人都希望得到中国的书籍，他们非常注意中国的发展和进步。许多人都希望有机会到中国去访问。
    无数生动的事实证明，打破了帝国主义加给他们的枷锁的伊拉克人民，普遍希望加强两国人民之间的友谊。
