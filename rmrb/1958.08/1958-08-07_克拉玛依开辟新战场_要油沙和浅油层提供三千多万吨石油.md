    Karamay Opens New Battlefield
    Oil Sands and Shallow Oil Layers to Provide Over 30 Million Tons of Oil

    (Our dispatch) The hundreds of millions of tons of oil sands and vast shallow oil field areas surrounding the Karamay mining area are about to become a huge national asset. According to recent preliminary surveys, these oil sands and shallow oil fields, previously regarded as useless, can yield at least 34 million tons of crude oil. This figure is more than twenty times the national oil production in 1957. Currently, in addition to vigorously drilling and developing large oil fields, the Karamay Mining Bureau is starting to open up new battlefields in oil sands and shallow oil fields.
    In the northwestern edge of the Karamay-Urho oil region, there are many oil sand hills and asphalt containing a strong crude oil scent, as well as shallow oil layers buried only three to four hundred meters deep. The Black Oil Mountain, famous in petroleum geology at home and abroad, is an oil sand hill formed by crude oil flowing out of the ground during stratum movement, covered by layers of sand and gravel. The oil sand area in Urho covers more than 30 square kilometers, which is the largest oil seep outcrop in the world. In the past, people had not thought of utilizing such a large number of oil seep outcrops. As for the large areas of shallow oil layers, people previously believed that the oil layers were thin, the production was small, and the conditions for mining were insufficient, so they were not given much attention. Recently, inspired by the General Line, many leading cadres and geological personnel have conducted practical research on oil sands and shallow oil fields. Preliminary tests of the oil sand from Black Oil Mountain show an oil content of 13%, which is higher than that of oil shale. The Karamay Mining Bureau has decided to first build a batch of indigenous distillation plants and mobilize a large number of family members in the mining area to participate in mining and refining. Currently, experiments with using indigenous methods to refine oil sands are underway.
    According to recent surveys, the shallow oil fields, in just four areas with better oil content, have an exploitable area of ​​179 square kilometers. These areas can accommodate more than 20,000 oil wells and produce at least more than 10 million tons of crude oil. Currently, small-boreholes are used for drilling in shallow oil fields, and drilling mud is manufactured locally. The drilling cost per meter is only 40 to 50 yuan, which is one-third of the cost of drilling in large oil fields.

### 克拉玛依开辟新战场  要油沙和浅油层提供三千多万吨石油

    克拉玛依开辟新战场
    要油沙和浅油层提供三千多万吨石油
    本报讯　克拉玛依矿区周围的亿万吨油沙和大片浅油层油田，即将变成国家巨大的财富。据最近初步勘查，这些过去被视为无用之物的油沙和浅油层油田，最少能采收原油三千四百多万吨。这个数字比1957年全国石油产量多二十几倍。目前，克拉玛依矿务局除继续大力钻探和开发大油田外，正着手开辟油沙和浅油层油田的新战场。
    在克拉玛依—乌尔禾油区西北边缘地带，有许多含着浓郁原油味的油沙山和沥青，以及埋藏仅有三、四百公尺深的浅油层。在石油地质上著名中外的黑油山，就是原油在地层运动中流出地面以后，沙石一层一层复盖上去而形成的油沙山。乌尔禾地区油沙面积有三十多平方公里，是世界上最大的油苗露头。这样大量的油苗露头，过去人们没有想过利用它。至于大片浅油层，过去人们也认为油层薄，产量小，不够开采条件，因而没有重视。最近，许多领导干部和地质人员受到总路线的鼓舞，对油沙和浅油层油田进行了切实研究。黑油山的油沙经过初步化验，含油率达13％，比油母页岩的含油率还高。克拉玛依矿务局已经确定先建一批土法蒸馏厂，发动矿区大批家属参加开采和炼制。现在，用土法炼油沙的试验已在进行。
    浅油层油田，根据最近勘查，仅含油较好的四个地区，有开采价值的面积就有一百七十九平方公里。这些地区能钻凿油井两万多口，最少能采出原油一千多万吨。目前对浅油层油田的钻探，采用了小井眼，就地取材制造钻井泥浆，每公尺钻井成本只需四、五十元，等于钻探大油田成本的三分之一。　　　　　　　　　　　（韩文慧）
