　　The Qinghai-Tibet Highway transportation workers, breaking with the special case theory of the plateau, vigorously carried out technical innovation to ensure smooth operation under harsh climatic conditions. This is a very gratifying thing.

　　Compared with the plains, the plateau does have its special problems and special difficulties, but these problems and difficulties are not fundamentally unsolvable. Where there are special problems in the world, people will certainly be able to find special solutions according to the special conditions and laws.

　　Conditions also have their variability. Exaggerating the particularity of difficulties and ignoring the variability of conditions is what "special case theory" is all about. We advocate emancipating the mind, daring to act, creating conditions, overcoming difficulties, and opposing the immutable special case theory.

    反对“特殊论”
    青藏公路运输职工，打破了高原特殊论，大搞技术革新，保证在恶劣的气候条件下，运行畅通无阻，这是一件十分可喜的事。
    高原同平原比起来，确实有它的特殊问题和特殊困难，但是，这些问题和困难并不是根本不能解决的。世界上有特殊的问题存在，人们一定能够根据特殊条件和规律，寻找特殊的办法去解决。
    条件也有它的可变性，夸大困难的特殊性，无视条件的可变性，这就是“特殊论”者。我们主张解放思想，敢作敢为，创造条件，克服困难，反对一成不变的特殊论。
