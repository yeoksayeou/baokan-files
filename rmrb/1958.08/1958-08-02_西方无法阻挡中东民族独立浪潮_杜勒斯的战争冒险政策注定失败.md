Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: TASS, New York, July 31st: The "New York Post" published an editorial commenting on the results of the "Baghdad Pact" conference that just closed in London, and criticizing American foreign policy.

　　The newspaper wrote: "Dulles has always suffered from treaty mania and has not shown particular foresight... It seems that the Iraqi riots and the fact that the country inevitably broke away from us have only taught Dulles that revolutions can be suppressed. The Iraqi events are a clear warning to us to rely on governments that do not have popular support... The oppressed people of the world are rising up. Russia has established contact with them in the language of revolution. But we are dealing with emperors, kings, and governments of republics that are obviously undemocratic (such as Turkey), isolating ourselves from the real power in these countries—the people."

　　The editorial said that Dulles secretly assured the governments of Turkey and Iran in the name of the U.S. government, behind the back of the U.S. Congress, telling them "not to worry about domestic opposition. If a revolution occurs, the regime in danger only needs to notify Washington, and the U.S. Marines will arrive immediately."

　　The "New York Post" acknowledged that such a war adventure policy is doomed to failure, and pointed out that the United States' plans to further interfere in the affairs of the Middle East countries have caused serious unease among some American politicians. Senators Morse, O'Mahoney, and Fulbright are all worried about the dangers that accompany this policy.

    西方无法阻挡中东民族独立浪潮
    杜勒斯的战争冒险政策注定失败
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社纽约7月31日讯：“纽约邮报”发表社论，评论刚在伦敦闭幕的“巴格达条约”会议的结果，并且抨击美国的外交政策。
    这家报纸写道：“杜勒斯一直害着条约狂，并且没有表现出特别的远见……看来伊拉克的暴动和这个国家必然脱离我们的事实给杜勒斯的教训仅仅是：革命是可以镇压的。伊拉克事件是对我们指靠得不到人民支持的政府的一个明确的警告……全世界受压迫的人行动起来了。俄国用革命的语言同他们建立了接触。而我们却同皇帝、国王和那些显然是不民主的共和国（如土耳其）的政府打交道，把自己同这些国家的现实力量——人民隔绝起来。”
    社论说，杜勒斯背着美国国会偷偷地以美国政府的名义向土耳其和伊朗的政府保证，叫它们“不要忧虑国内的反对。如果发生革命，遭受危险的政权只要通知华盛顿，美国海军陆战队马上就会到那里去”。
    “纽约邮报”承认这样的战争冒险政策注定是要失败的，并且指出，美国进一步干涉中近东国家事务的计划引起了美国一些政界人士的严重不安。参议员莫尔斯、奥马洪尼和富布赖特都耽心伴随这种政策而来的危险。
