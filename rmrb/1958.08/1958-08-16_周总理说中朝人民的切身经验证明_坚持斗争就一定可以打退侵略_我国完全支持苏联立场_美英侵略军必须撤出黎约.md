Xinhua News Agency, 15th - Premier Zhou Enlai said tonight: "All peace-loving countries and people in the world demand that the United States and Britain withdraw their aggressive troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The Soviet Union has already put forward corresponding proposals at the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly based on this universal demand. We fully support the Soviet Union's solemn position."

Premier Zhou Enlai severely condemned the aggressive actions of the US and Britain and expressed the solemn position of the Chinese people in his speech at the reception held by the Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yonghao, tonight to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea. Premier Zhou pointed out: "Recently, the United States, together with Britain, launched an armed aggression against the Arab people. To this day, US-British aggressor troops are still entrenched on the territories of Lebanon and Jordan. The war clouds hanging over the Middle East have not yet dissipated." Premier Zhou said: "We believe that if the United Nations does not want its prestige to continue to decline in the eyes of the world's people, the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly should, in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, earnestly take on the solemn responsibility of stopping aggression and safeguarding peace. No matter what the outcome of the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, no matter how US President Eisenhower tries to quibble, intimidate and deceive, the US-British aggressor troops must completely withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. The Chinese and Korean people have learned from their own experiences that as long as the people of all countries persist in their struggle, imperialist aggression can certainly be repelled, and the just struggle to safeguard national independence and world peace will surely be victorious."

Premier Zhou said in his speech: "Recently, the US government, on the one hand, together with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, has intensified the tense situation in the Far East, and on the other hand, has reiterated its so-called policy of non-recognition of the People's Republic of China, repeating the slander about 'communist aggression' to intimidate the Asian and African people." Premier Zhou emphasized: "China has never been interested in US recognition. No matter what sophistry the US government engages in, it cannot conceal the bankruptcy of its policy towards China, nor can it conceal its aggression and interference in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the guise of anti-communism." Premier Zhou pointed out that "the US practice of persisting in hostility towards the Chinese and Korean people in the Far East and creating tension throughout the world will ultimately lead to the bankruptcy and failure of the US policy of aggression." These words of Premier Zhou Enlai were warmly applauded by Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th - Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yonghao, held a grand reception this evening to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

　　周总理说中朝人民的切身经验证明
　　坚持斗争就一定可以打退侵略
　　我国完全支持苏联立场　美英侵略军必须撤出黎约
    新华社15日讯　周恩来总理今晚说：“全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民都要求美国和英国从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的侵略军队。苏联已经根据这种普遍的要求在联合国大会紧急特别会议上提出了相应的提案。我们完全支持苏联的严正立场。”
    周恩来总理今晚在朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐为庆祝苏军解放朝鲜纪念日而举行的招待会上的讲话中严厉谴责了美英的侵略行为，表示了中国人民的严正立场。周总理指出：“最近，美国又伙同英国对阿拉伯人民发动了武装侵略。直到目前，美英侵略军队还盘踞在黎巴嫩和约旦的领土上。笼罩着中近东的战争阴云还没有消散。”周总理说：“我们认为，如果联合国不想使自己的威信在世界人民的面前继续低落下去，联合国大会紧急特别会议就应该根据联合国宪章的精神，切实负起制止侵略、保卫和平的庄严责任。不管联合国大会紧急特别会议的结果怎样，不管美国总统艾森豪威尔怎样狡辩、恐吓和哄骗，美英侵略军队必须完全撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。中朝人民从他们的切身经验体会到，只要各国人民坚持斗争，帝国主义的侵略是一定可以打退的，维护民族独立和世界和平的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。”
    周总理在讲话中说：“美国政府最近一方面同蒋介石集团一起，加剧远东的紧张局势，另一方面又重申它的所谓不承认中华人民共和国的政策，重弹关于‘共产主义侵略’的谰调来恐吓亚非人民。”周总理强调地说：“中国从来就对美国的承认不感兴趣，美国政府不论进行怎样的诡辩，也掩盖不了它的对华政策的破产，也掩盖不了它在反共的幌子下对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多国家的侵略和干涉。”周总理指出，“美国在远东坚持敌视中朝人民、在全世界制造紧张局势的做法，最后必将导致美国侵略政策的破产和失败。”周恩来总理的这些话，得到了出席招待会的中外人士的热烈掌声。
    据新华社15日讯　朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐今天晚间举行盛大招待会，庆祝朝鲜解放十三周年。
