    City Walls that Constrain Urban Development
    Wang Qixian

    Rules and regulations in production management, if they cannot be improved along with the development of the situation, will not only fail to promote production but also constrain it. However, productive forces are the most active and revolutionary, and you cannot restrain them even if you try; they will eventually break through.

    The situation with city walls is similar. In the past, they played a role in promoting and protecting urban construction, but now they have clearly become obstacles to urban development. Taking the city of Beijing as an example, the fact that there are gaps everywhere is enough to illustrate this point.

    Opening a few gaps in the city walls is just a breakthrough at specific points; it does not fundamentally solve the problem. Further and thorough removal is still needed. Especially under the current call for saving construction land, the city walls occupy a large amount of land, which is a potential force that can be fully tapped.

    To demolish the city walls, especially the city walls of Beijing, it is easy to generate a sense of regret and even resistance from the perspective of protecting cultural relics. I think it is necessary to soberly assess here how much value cultural relics have. In any case, they cannot affect current development; haven't the Three Gates in front of Tiananmen Square and various kinds of memorial archways all been demolished? So what is there to regret about a city wall that is full of gaps?

    Let us use the form of voluntary labor that everyone loves to remove this obstacle!

    束缚城市发展的城墙
    王启贤
    生产管理方面的规章制度，如果不能随着形势的发展而改进，就不仅不能促进生产，还束缚了生产。然而生产力是最活动最革命的，你要束缚也束缚不住，最后终于被它突破。
    城墙的情况也仿佛如此。它在过去对城市的建设也起着促进和保护的作用，但是现在显然已成了城市发展中的障碍了。以北京城为例，如今到处都是豁口就足以说明。
    城墙开了几个豁口只是点的突破，并没有根本解决问题，还需要进一步彻底清除。特别是在目前节约建筑用地的号召下，城墙却占用了大量土地，这是可以充分发掘的潜在力量。
    要拆城墙，特别是要拆北京的城墙，从保护文化古物的角度来说，不免容易产生一种婉惜甚至抵触的情绪。我想这里需要清醒地估计一下，文化古物需要保护，但也要看它的价值有多大，无论如何总不能影响当前的发展；天安门前面的三座门，还有各式各样的牌楼，不都已全部拆除了吗？那末对于一座到处是豁口的城墙又有何足惜呢？
    让我们用大家喜爱的义务劳动的形式，拔除这个障碍物吧！
