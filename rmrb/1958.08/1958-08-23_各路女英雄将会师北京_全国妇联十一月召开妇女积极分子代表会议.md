Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: The All-China Women's Federation today issued a notice regarding the convening of a National Conference of Women Activists in Socialist Construction.

The notice stated that under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of women, giving full play to their strength and wisdom, have made great contributions to accelerating socialist construction. In industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, in the technical revolution and cultural revolution movements, women have shown tenacious will and assiduous spirit, powerfully impacting conservative, self-deprecating, and superstitious ideas, and greatly promoting the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. On this basis, advanced women's collectives and advanced individuals have emerged in the thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands across various regions. For example, the "Million Girls" movement launched in Hubei Province, the "100,000 Zhang Qiuxiangs" movement in Shaanxi Province, and many other regions' movements such as "Thousand-Jin Girls, Ten-Thousand-Jin Sisters-in-Law," "Thousand Chrysanthemums, Ten Thousand Peonies," and "Clever Girls" have all achieved great results. On the industrial front, the broad masses of female workers have actively participated in red banner competitions and technical innovation movements. In all aspects of socialist construction, many female new record creators, female inventors, female experts, and female "all-rounders" have emerged. The advanced thinking and advanced deeds of these advanced individuals have not only made outstanding contributions to labor production and even created miracles, but have also played a huge encouraging role in promoting the further liberation of women's thinking and the further exploitation of women's labor potential. In order to commend the advanced collectives and advanced individuals of women across the country, summarize and exchange their advanced thinking and advanced experiences, establish advanced banners in all aspects of work, further encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women to build socialism, and to enable women to exert even greater efforts to welcome the greater socialist construction upsurge this winter and next year, the Federation has decided to convene a National Conference of Women Activists in Socialist Construction in Beijing in November 1958.

The notice stated that the representatives attending the conference should mainly be advanced collectives and advanced individuals in industrial and agricultural production, while also including advanced collectives and advanced individuals in all aspects of socialist construction and various work positions. The total number of representatives is 1,300. The specific requirements for representatives are not uniformly stipulated nationwide, and each province, city, autonomous region, and central government organ should select the most outstanding individuals from their respective regions and units to participate.

The notice requires women's federations at all levels, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, to adopt various effective methods, mobilize the broadest publicity forces, and combine this notice with the current situation and production tasks to convey it to the broad masses of women, and widely carry out publicity. It calls on the broad masses of women to strive to be advanced and strive to be models; everyone should make contributions to socialism and create miracles for socialism. It also calls on the broad masses of women to strive to greet the convening of the conference with the most advanced achievements. Women's federations at all levels should, through this publicity work, further promote the ideological liberation of women in the communist spirit; and further set off a wave of women learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced.
