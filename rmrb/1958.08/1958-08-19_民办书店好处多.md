　　Private Bookstores Have Many Advantages
    Since the technical and cultural revolutions have been widely carried out, reading has become a major event in the lives of the masses. Faced with such a new situation, it is clear that the old method of book distribution can no longer meet this requirement. In order to solve this sharp contradiction between need and supply, the book distribution work in many areas has also undergone a great leap forward. Private bookstores are a new form of book distribution at present.
    Running private bookstores can quickly change the situation of passive and shallow book supply. Judging from some of the private bookstores that have already been established, its prominent features are: it can timely understand and meet the needs of readers; it can actively cooperate with the local political and production centers and various meetings held in the villages. Therefore, these bookstores are deeply welcomed by the local party and government leaders and the masses.
    Private bookstores are established under the leadership of local party committees and administrations, fully relying on the masses, using the manpower, materials and financial resources of the masses. Therefore, it is possible to run more, run faster, and spend less money, which is in line with the general line. They blossom everywhere in a very short period of time, greatly accelerating the construction of the book distribution network. At the same time, because private bookstores come from the masses and serve the masses, their work can often be placed under the supervision of the masses, and the work can be continuously improved.

　　民办书店好处多
    技术革命和文化革命运动广泛开展以后，读书是广大群众生活中的大事。面对这样新的形势，很显然，老一套的图书发行工作方法已不能满足这种要求，为了解决这种需要与供应的尖锐矛盾，许多地区的图书发行工作也来了个大跃进，民办书店就是当前图书发行的新形式。
    举办民办书店可以很快改变图书供应不主动，不深入的局面。从已经办起来的一些民办书店来看，它的突出表现是：对读者的需要能及时了解，满足供应；对当地的政治、生产中心和乡召开的各种会议能够主动配合，因此，这些书店深受当地党政领导和群众的欢迎。
    民办书店是在地方党委和行政的领导下，充分依靠群众，使用群众的人力、物力和财力办起来的，因此它有可能办得多，办得快，花钱少，符合总路线的方针，很短时期内就遍地开花，大大加速了图书发行网的建设，同时由于民办书店来自群众，又服务于群众，它的工作经常能置于群众监督之下，工作就能够不断改进。
