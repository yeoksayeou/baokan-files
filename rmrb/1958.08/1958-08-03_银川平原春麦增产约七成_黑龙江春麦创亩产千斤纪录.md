Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, August 2nd: The 1,060,000 mu of spring wheat in the Yinchuan Plain of Ningxia region has been completely harvested, with a total output of 503,610,000 jin, an increase of 69% over last year. The average yield per mu is 475 jin, an increase of 59.73% over last year.

This year, not only has the total output of spring wheat in the Yinchuan Plain surged, but also many high-yield records have emerged in various places. The 1.1 mu experimental plot of the Hongqi Cooperative in Zhongning County achieved an average yield of 4,626 jin per mu. The 1.15 mu experimental plot cultivated by five demobilized soldiers, Xing Tianxiang, Tian Fazhi, Zhang Lizhong, Zhang Guoxiang, and Xing Fayuan, in the Hongxing Cooperative of the same county, also achieved an average yield of 4,413 jin per mu.

Before liberation, the wheat yield per mu in the Ningxia region was generally only about 150 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 1st: The Xinghua Agricultural Cooperative in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, located near 47 degrees north latitude, has a 1.589 mu spring wheat experimental plot that actually produced 1,604 jin, equivalent to 1,009 jin per mu. This is the first high-yield record to appear in the northernmost rural area of our country this year, which is 349 jin more than the previous highest yield of 660 jin per mu in Heilongjiang Province, and equal to seven and a half times the average yield per mu in the province during last year's bumper harvest of spring wheat.

This experimental plot was cultivated by Kou Yabin, the 23-year-old deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Xinghua Cooperative, and League members Yu Yuancheng, Lu Yufeng, and Tian Guozhen. When the harvest took place on July 26th, Song Lingting, the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Jixian County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Qinglin, the station chief of the Yong'an Township Agricultural Technology Extension Station, the heads of the Party and League organizations of the township and cooperative, the three production team leaders of the agricultural cooperative, and many old farmers all participated in the harvesting process and measured the land.
