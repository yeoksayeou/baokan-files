Xinhua News Agency, Xushui, 23rd: A nationwide upsurge in studying theory and philosophy has emerged in the people's communes of Xushui County, Hebei Province. Cadres and commune members are also quickly implementing the theories they have learned into practical action.

Under the new situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, new things are emerging one after another. In particular, the people of Xushui County are facing a series of new issues, such as how to run the people's communes well and how to build socialism at high speed. Therefore, cadres and commune members are eager to improve their thinking and theoretical level in practical life. Based on this new situation, the Xushui County Committee of the Communist Party of China established a Marxism-Leninism school as early as June 2nd to organize theoretical study throughout the county. Now, under the direct leadership of the Party committee, the study of theory and philosophy has developed from 289 groups with 3,741 participants, mainly county, township, and village-level cadres, to a mass movement. The number of study groups has increased to 1,111, with a total of more than 52,600 people directly and indirectly participating in the study.

Cadres and commune members in Xushui County have adopted the method of combining study with production, linking theory with practice, and conducting discussions and debates based on the specific facts of their own commune, township, and county to enhance understanding and unify thinking. County and township cadres generally focus on self-study, supplemented by large lectures and key speeches. Village and commune cadres, as well as Party and Youth League members, combine lecturing with group discussions. Commune members generally learn through indirect instruction from cadres,展开ing discussions and debates, closely combined with production. They have now studied philosophical theories such as "two different types of contradictions," "two different results of exerting full effort and insufficient effort," "conditionalism," and "whether subjective initiative and objective possibilities are finite or infinite." When Cui Zhuang Commune studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," they combined it with the current grain work, raising the facts of landlords in the village sabotaging the grain policy and poor peasants shouting about food shortages, and asked everyone to discuss and analyze the issue of two different types of contradictions. Dou Zhangde, a cadre in the commune whose work style was originally rigid, quickly changed his style after this study. In the recent work of demolishing old houses to accumulate fertilizer, he first conducted patient persuasion and mobilization among the commune members, explaining the reasons for demolishing old houses and describing the bright and happy prospects of the people's commune. This not only successfully completed the task of demolishing old houses to accumulate fertilizer, but also strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. Through the study of "man can conquer nature," the members of Xie Fang Village realized that they must break with conditionalism, and they eliminated more than 4,000 mu of weeds in four days and universally carried out topdressing.

Through this period of study, it has been fully proved that farmers can not only study philosophy, but are also easy to accept philosophical principles. The key lies in whether the leadership's method of study is correct. As long as the method of study combines theory with practice, cadres and commune members can quickly grasp the theory and quickly implement it into their practical actions.

### 掀起一个全民学哲学的热潮  徐水各人民公社人人攻理论

　　掀起一个全民学哲学的热潮
    徐水各人民公社人人攻理论
    据新华社徐水23日电　河北省徐水县各人民公社出现了人人攻理论，全民学哲学的热潮。干部和社员并且把学到的理论很快贯彻到实际行动中去。
    在工农业大跃进的新形势下，新鲜事物层出不穷，特别是徐水县的人民面临着当前如何办好人民公社、如何高速度建成社会主义等一系列的新问题。因此干部和社员都迫切要求在实际生活中提高思想，提高理论水平。中共徐水县委根据这种新的形势，早在6月2日便建立马列主义学校，在全县范围内组织理论学习。现在，在党委的直接领导下，攻理论，学哲学，已由过去县乡干部、村社主要干部参加的二百八十九个小组、三千七百四十一人，发展成了全民性的运动。学习小组已发展到一千一百一十一个，直接和间接参加学习的共有五万二千六百多人。
    徐水县干部和社员采取了学习与生产相结合、理论与实际相联系、通过本社本乡本县的具体事实，进行鸣放辩论，达到提高认识、统一思想的方法来学习理论。县乡干部一般是自学为主，辅以上大课和重点发言。村社干部和党员团员是讲授和小组讨论相结合。社员学习一般是由干部间接传授，展开鸣放辩论，密切结合生产。他们现在已经学习了“两类不同性质的矛盾”、“鼓足干劲和干劲不足的两种不同的结果”、“唯条件论”、“主观能动性和客观可能性是有限的还是无限的”等哲学理论。崔庄社在学习“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”时，结合当前粮食工作，提出本村地主分子破坏粮食政策和贫农叫喊缺粮的事实，让大家讨论和分析两种不同性质的矛盾的问题。社里原来工作作风生硬的干部窦章德，经过这次学习，作风很快有了转变。在最近拆旧房积肥的工作中，他首先向社员进行了耐心的说服动员，讲明了拆旧房的道理，说明人民公社美好幸福的前景，这样就不但顺利完成拆旧房积肥的任务，而且密切了干部与群众的关系。谢坊村通过事在人为的学习，社员认识了必须打破唯条件论，四天就消灭了四千多亩草荒，普遍进行了追肥。
    通过这一段的学习，充分证明农民不仅能学哲学，而且易于接受哲学原理，关键在于领导学习的方法是否正确。只要学习的方法是理论与实际相结合，干部和社员就很快能掌握理论，并且能很快贯彻到他们的实际行动中去。
