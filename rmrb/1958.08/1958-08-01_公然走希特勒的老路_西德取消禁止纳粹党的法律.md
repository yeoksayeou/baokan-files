Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Bonn dispatch: The Hitler Nazi Party, which once slaughtered millions of innocent people and was hated and spurned by people all over the world, can now openly and legally operate in West Germany again. This measure, which clears the way for the fascization of West Germany, was decided by a law recently passed by the West German Federal Parliament to abolish the laws banning the Hitler Nazi Party. Today, the "Federal Gazette" in Bonn published this law.

This law, passed by Adenauer's party's voting machine, has been strongly opposed by the West German people and public opinion at home and abroad. When discussing this draft law, West German Social Democratic Party member Wittrock pointed out that there is now a clear tendency towards fascization in West Germany, and the abolition of the ban on the Hitler Party is another sign of this tendency. The Association of Victims of Nazism also protested, saying: "The victims under Hitler's rule in the past believe that this step is open support for the Nazis."

The Adenauer government is a hotbed for the revival of Nazis and fascism. Many of Hitler's former loyal servants have now become the backbone of this regime. Half of the ministers in the Bonn government are former "SS" and "Stormtroopers" captains and members, or active promoters of fascism. Among the officials in the Bonn Foreign Ministry, 80% once served under Ribbentrop. The head of the West German Defense Forces, Heusinger, was originally a staff officer of the Nazi General Staff and participated in the formulation of Hitler's invasion plans. And the West German General Speidel, who served as the Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe of the North Atlantic Group, was the Chief of Staff of the Nazi Army Headquarters in France in the past. At the same time, many monopoly capitalists who were once listed as economic war criminals, such as Krupp, have once again taken control of the most important economic lifeline of West Germany. Under the Adenauer government's protection, there are currently 123 fascist youth organizations in West Germany, many of which shamelessly openly declare that they are the successors of the Hitler Youth League.

### 公然走希特勒的老路  西德取消禁止纳粹党的法律

    公然走希特勒的老路
    西德取消禁止纳粹党的法律
    新华社柏林30日电　波恩消息：曾经屠杀过千百万善良的人们并且为全世界人民所憎恶和唾弃的希特勒纳粹党徒，今天起又可以公开地和合法地在西德活动了，这项为西德的法西斯化扫清道路的措施，是西德联邦议院不久以前通过的一项取消禁止希特勒纳粹党的法律所决定的。今天波恩的“联邦公报”刊载了这项法律。
    由阿登纳的党的表决机器所通过的这项法律，曾经遭到西德人民和国内外舆论的强烈反对。西德社会民主党议员维特罗克在讨论这个法律草案时指出，西德现在已经有明显的法西斯化的倾向，而取消对希特勒党的禁止，正是这一倾向的又一个标志。受纳粹之害者协会也曾经抗议说：“过去希特勒统治下的受害者认为，这种步骤是对纳粹的公开支持。”
    阿登纳政府是纳粹分子和法西斯主义复活的温床。许多过去希特勒的忠实奴仆现在几乎都成了这个政权的骨干。在波恩政府的部长中，有一半是过去的“党卫军”和“冲锋队”的队长和队员，或者是法西斯主义的积极推行者。在波恩外交部的官员中，有80％曾经在里宾特洛甫手下服务过。西德国防军首脑豪辛格原来是纳粹总参谋部的参谋，并且参与过希特勒的侵略计划的制订工作。而出任北大西洋集团欧洲盟军司令的西德将军斯派达尔，过去则是纳粹军队驻法国总部的总参谋长。同时，许多曾经被列为经济战犯的垄断资本家像克虏伯等，今天也都重新掌握了西德的最重要的经济命脉。在阿登纳政府卵翼下，目前在西德已经有一百二十三个法西斯青年组织，其中有许多甚至无耻地公开宣称它们是希特勒青年团的后继者。
