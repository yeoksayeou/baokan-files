Xinhua News Agency, Pingdingshan, 17th - Pingdingshan Coal Mine is vigorously promoting hydraulic mining. Currently, three new mine shafts here have successfully tested hydraulic mining. The six mine shafts under construction are also concentrating technical forces, urgently revising the original design, and preparing to be converted into hydraulic mining mine shafts.

The first difficulty encountered in promoting hydraulic mining was the lack of hydraulic mining machinery. However, the slogan of the mine's workers is: "Resolutely refuse to be dependent and aspire to be self-reliant." They decided to use the mine's machine repair shop to manufacture equipment such as water cannons themselves.

　　平顶山煤矿大搞水力采煤
    新华社平顶山17日电　平顶山煤矿正在大搞水力采煤。目前这里已经有三对新矿井试验成功了水力采煤。正在建设中的六对矿井，也都集中技术力量，突击修改原设计，准备改为水力采煤矿井。
    推行水力采煤首先碰到的困难是没有水力采煤机械。但是这个矿的职工的口号是：“坚决不当伸手派，立志当自力更生派”，他们决定利用矿上的机修车间来自造水枪等设备。
