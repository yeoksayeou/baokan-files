    A Heavy Blow to the Aggressors
    Chúnchéng
    The peace declaration issued by the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, representing one-third of humanity, instantly swept around the globe and resounded through the skies, inspiring all peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the world. Various provinces and cities in China enthusiastically hailed and supported the communiqué of the talks. In many places, the masses held symposiums and parades, and posted big-character posters and letters of determination on the very day they heard the news on the radio. Workers pledged to express their sincere support with practical actions to strengthen production. The Soviet people also unanimously and wholeheartedly supported the communiqué of the talks, and many factories and collective farms held discussions one after another. They said that the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is harder than steel, and the power of this friendship is greater than any atomic or hydrogen bomb. All socialist countries' newspapers published commentaries, fully supporting the warnings of China and the Soviet Union to imperialism. Newspapers in Cairo and Iraqi radio warmly welcomed the support of China and the Soviet Union for the struggle of the Arab people. Many newspapers in India, Indonesia, and Japan also stated that this communiqué is the most important guarantee of world peace and a new declaration of peace.
    What about that small handful of imperialists? According to reports from Western news agencies, when they learned of this news, they felt either "puzzled," "sudden," "unexpected," and "strange," or "greatly surprised" and "greatly shocked," saying that the communiqué of the talks was an "unexpected blow" and a "bolt from the blue" to them. For these warmongers, whose brains are feverish and dazed by the dreams of aggression, this great declaration is indeed like a refreshing breeze, blowing through the gunpowder smoke they have stirred up, forcing them to break out in a cold sweat and calm their minds.
    However, "they won't shed tears until they see the coffin," these fellows will not give up. While being shocked, they still try their best, desperately coming up with some tricks to save their defeat. They fear the enormous power represented by the declaration, fear the firm confidence expressed by the declaration, and cannot but estimate the broad and far-reaching influence it will have. So, like a cornered dog jumping over the wall, they attempt to distort the truth and slander the content of the communiqué.
    The American "New York Times" did not hesitate to step forward and lead the cheerleading squad for spreading rumors and lies. In its editorial on the 4th, it actually said that the communiqué of the talks "proves" that China and the Soviet Union "are trying to intensify rather than ease world tensions." Isn't this a fantastic tale from overseas? We want to ask the editorial writers of the "New York Times": Why did the leaders of China and the Soviet Union hold talks? Was it because the Soviet or Chinese troops landed in Lebanon and Jordan half a month ago, threatening peace in the Middle East and the world, leading to angry protests from the Arab people? Was it Eisenhower or Dulles who initiated and actively promoted the convening of a summit conference of the heads of government of major powers to ease international tensions? It is clear that the American and British troops are committing atrocities in the Middle East, that American and British planes and warships are acting lawlessly in the Mediterranean, that the aggressive groups that believe in force and thirst for war are doing everything possible to obstruct the major power conference, but they are now turning around and accusing the Soviet Union and China of "intensifying" "world tensions."
    The writers who serve the imperialist aggressive groups have been given a fitting title, called "jackals with pens." The author of this editorial in the "New York Times" truly deserves to be called a typical jackal with a pen, and one of the shameless tricks of this kind of jackal is to bite back, the so-called "thief crying 'catch the thief'." They light the fires of aggression themselves, fearing the criticism of world opinion, so they insist on saying that the great efforts made by socialist countries to prevent war are "intensifying" "world tensions." This is perhaps the most daring and shameless lie of this era.
    However, the consistent peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and China cannot be obliterated, and the aggressive crimes of American and British imperialism cannot be covered up. While the editorial writers of the "New York Times" are slandering the peaceful efforts of China and the Soviet Union, and quibbling for their masters, Western news agencies are constantly revealing that the American invading troops continue to land in Lebanon, and that the number of American troops invading Lebanon will reach 15,000 by August 6. More than 100 warships have been assembled in the Mediterranean, far from Washington and London. For this, I don't know how the jackals of the "New York Times" will bark, how they will defend themselves? From their incoherent "barking" and indiscriminate biting, we can also see how heavy the blow the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué has given them is.

    对侵略者的沉重的一击
    春城
    中苏两国领导人代表人类三分之一人口所发出的和平宣言，一霎时绕遍地球，响彻云霄，鼓舞了全世界爱好和平爱好自由的人民。中国各个省市热烈欢呼和拥护会谈公报，许多地方的群众当天一听到广播消息，就举行了座谈会和游行，贴出了大字报和决心书。工人们提出保证要用加强生产的实际行动来表示拥护的赤忱。苏联人民也一致衷心拥护会谈公报，许多工厂和农庄纷纷举行讨论会。他们说，中苏两国人民的友谊比钢铁还硬，这种友谊的力量大于任何原子弹和氢弹。所有社会主义国家报纸纷纷发表评论，完全支持中苏对帝国主义的警告。开罗各报、伊拉克电台热烈欢迎中苏支持阿拉伯人民的斗争。印度、印度尼西亚和日本的许多报纸也都表示这个公报是世界和平的最重要的保证，是新的和平宣言。
    至于那一小撮帝国主义者又怎样呢？从西方通讯社的报道看来，当他们知道了这个消息后，不是感到“迷惑”“突然”“意外”和“奇怪”，便是“大吃一惊”“大为震惊”，说会谈公报对他们是一个“意外的打击”和“晴天霹雳”。对于这些被侵略的迷梦弄得脑子发热发昏的战争贩子来说，这个伟大的宣言的确像一阵清凉的风，吹破了他们所搅起来的火药的烟雾，不由得他们不出一身冷汗，脑子冷静一下。
    但是，“不见棺材不落泪”，这辈家伙是不会甘休的。他们一面吃惊，一面还要挖空心思、穷凶极恶地搞出一些花样出来，以便挽救自己的失败。他们害怕宣言所代表的巨大的力量，害怕宣言所表达的坚强的信心，也不能不估计到它将要产生的广泛深远的影响，就狗急跳墙，企图颠倒黑白，污蔑公报的内容。
    美国“纽约时报”不惜挺身出来走在造谣撒谎的啦啦队的前列。它在4日的社论中居然说什么会谈公报“证明”了中苏“正在努力加剧而不是缓和世界的紧张局势”。这不是海外奇谈吗？我们要问“纽约时报”的社论作者：中苏领导人为什么要会谈？难道是为了苏联或者中国的军队在半个月之前登陆黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁中东和世界和平，以致引起阿拉伯人民的愤怒抗议吗？难道是艾森豪威尔或者杜勒斯发起并积极促进大国政府首脑会议的召开，来和缓国际紧张局势吗？明明是美英军队在中东行凶出丑，明明是美英飞机、军舰在地中海横行不法，明明是迷信武力、嗜战渴血的侵略集团在百般阻挠大国会议，却倒打一耙，无耻地叫嚣苏联和中国在“加剧”“世界的紧张局势”。
    为帝国主义侵略集团服务的文人曾经获得过一个恰如其份的称号，叫做“拿着笔杆的豺狼”。像“纽约时报”这篇社论的作者，真不愧为一只典型的拿着笔杆的豺狼，而这种豺狼的无耻伎俩之一便是反咬一口，所谓“贼喊捉贼”。自己点起侵略的战火，害怕世界舆论指责，便把社会主义国家为防止战争所作的伟大努力，硬说成是“加剧”“世界的紧张局势”的事。这也许是这个时代的最大胆最无耻的谎话了。
    但是，苏联和中国的一贯的和平外交政策是抹杀不了的，美英帝国主义的侵略罪行也是掩盖不了的。正在“纽约时报”社论作者污蔑中苏的和平努力，替主子狡辩的同时，西方通讯社却不断在透露，美国侵略军继续在黎巴嫩登陆，到8月6日将使侵黎美军的人数达到一万五千名。距离华盛顿和伦敦很远的地中海里已经集结了一百多艘军舰。对于这，不知道“纽约时报”的豺狼又将怎样吠叫，怎么辩解？从它们的“吠”无伦次，乱咬一通来看，也可以看出中苏会谈公报所给予他们的打击的沉重了。
