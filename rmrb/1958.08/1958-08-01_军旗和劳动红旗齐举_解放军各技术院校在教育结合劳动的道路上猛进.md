Holding High the Military Flag and the Red Flag of Labor
PLA Technical Institutes Advance Vigorously on the Road of Combining Education with Labor

    This newspaper reports that the teaching staff, workers, and students of the technical institutes of the various special forces under the People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force have raised their ideological awareness in the Double-Anti Movement, broken down conservative thinking, implemented the policy of combining education with production, and improved the quality of teaching.
    Most military technical institutes possess fifty or sixty or more machine tools and other machinery, equivalent to the equipment of a medium-sized machine manufacturing or repair factory. The technical strength is also considerable. However, the utilization rate of the experimental factories and laboratories in various schools is very low. For example, the utilization rate of the laboratory of a certain naval machinery school is only 8.85 hours per week on average, and the utilization rate of the experimental factory is only 30% on average, except for two months of internship. Taking the 1956-1957 academic year as an example, the average workload of teachers, teaching assistants, and other technical personnel was only 8.17 hours per week. After the implementation of the combination of education and production, this situation has completely changed. In the practice of production, students not only learned operational skills, but also created a great deal of wealth, supporting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. At the request of the local Provincial People's Committee, a certain military engineering college designed and manufactured the Songhua River No. 8 universal gas tractor to help local people realize agricultural mechanization throughout the province within five years. After twenty-three days and nights of hard work by teachers, students, and factory workers of a certain department of the college, the first Songhua River No. 8 tractor was successfully trial-produced on April 15. After the test drive, the performance proved to be good. They also agreed with the factory to cooperate in the production of 1,200 tractors this year. In the process of production and labor, the teachers and students of the whole college corrected their views on physical labor. People who yearned for the title of associate doctor in the past are now talking about going all out, learning more from the workers, and striving to become an intellectual of the working class. After mass discussion, a naval machinery school proposed thirty-six production projects, including design, surveying, repair, and processing, and immediately contacted twenty units, including local aquatic product shipyards, aquatic product companies, valve factories, refrigeration machinery factories, and electrical equipment factories, to sign contracts. Up to now, it has completed eight tasks, including plastic experiments and the production of oxygen nozzles, and has delivered the goods to the ordering units. These production activities supporting local industry not only meet teaching requirements, but also create better conditions for teaching. For example, in salvaging sunken ships, diving exercises in the past could only be carried out in a 5-meter-deep diving tank in the laboratory. This time they had to work in deep water more than 24 meters deep, and on the sea with various winds, waves, and unpredictable climate changes. In fact, this trained divers in deep-water operations. A certain railway corps school participated in the construction of the Zhulong River Reservoir project, which played a significant role in local water conservancy construction. The Zhulong River has flooded for years, submerging hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile land. After the reservoir is completed, not only can these lands be protected from disasters, but also more than 250,000 acres of land can be irrigated. The railway corps school invested dozens of engineering machines used for teaching into production, and all projects can be completed this year. The local people warmly welcomed and suggested naming the reservoir "August 1st Reservoir". During the construction, the school moved the classroom to the site, teaching and constructing at the same time. In the construction of opening diversion tunnels, digging wells, and laying light rails, the students applied the theoretical knowledge taught by the teachers to production. At the same time, using the method of following workers, they also learned the practical operation, troubleshooting, and mechanical maintenance techniques from the drivers. The teachers said that participating in the reservoir project this time truly achieved three satisfactions: "The people are satisfied because it accelerated the water conservancy project; the students are satisfied because they learned theoretical knowledge and mastered operational techniques; and the teachers are satisfied because it enriched the teaching content and experience and improved the teaching level."

    军旗和劳动红旗齐举
    解放军各技术院校在教育结合劳动的道路上猛进
    本报讯　人民解放军陆、海、空军各特种兵所属技术院校的教、职、学员在双反运动中，提高了思想觉悟，打破了保守思想，贯彻教育结合生产的方针，提高了教学质量。
    各军事技术院校大多拥有五、六十台或更多的机床和其他机械，相当于中型机器制造厂或修理厂的设备。技术力量也相当可观。但各校的实习工厂、实验室利用率很低。如某海军机械学校的实验室利用率平均每周只有八点八五小时，实习工厂除两个月实习外，平均利用率只有30％，教员助教等技术人员以1956—1957年度为例，平均每周工作量只有八点一七小时。实行教育结合生产之后，就完全改变了这种情况。学员在实习生产中，不仅学到了操作技能，而且创造出了大量财富，支援了工农业的大跃进。某军事工程学院，应当地省人民委员会的要求，设计、制造松花江八号万能煤气拖拉机，帮助当地人民在五年内实现全省农业机械化。该院某系的教师、学员和工厂工人经过二十三天的昼夜苦干，终于在4月15日把第一台松花江八号拖拉机试制成功了。经过试车，证明性能良好。他们还同工厂议定，今年协作生产一千二百台拖拉机。全院师生在生产劳动过程中，端正了对体力劳动的看法。过去向往副博士头衔的人们，现在谈论的却是鼓足干劲、多向工人学习，争取当个工人阶级知识分子了。某海军机械学校经过群众讨论，提出了设计、测绘、修理、加工等三十六种生产项目，并马上与地方的水产修造船厂、水产公司、阀门厂、冷冻机器厂、电工器材厂等二十个单位进行联系，订立合同。到目前为止，已完成了塑料试验、氧气嘴子的生产等八项任务，并向订货单位交了货。这些支援地方工业的生产活动不仅符合教学要求，而且给教学创造了更好的条件。如打捞沉船，过去潜水练习只能在实验室五公尺深的潜水柜中进行。这次他们须在深水二十四公尺以下，并在各种风浪、气候变化无常的大海上进行工作。实际上这就锻炼了潜水员深水作业的技术。某铁道兵学校参加潴龙河水库工程的兴修，对地方水利建设起了很大作用。潴龙河历年泛滥，淹没良田数十万亩。水库建成后，不仅可使这些土地免受灾害，还可灌溉二十五万亩以上的田地。铁道兵学校将教学用的几十台工程机械，投入生产后，今年内即可完成全部工程。当地人民热烈欢迎，并建议将水库定名为“八一水库”。在施工中间，学校把课堂搬到现场，边教学边施工。学员在开输水洞、挖水井、铺设轻便轨道等项施工中，把教员讲的理论知识运用到生产中去。同时，用跟班劳动的方法，又向司机学习了实际操作、故障排除和机械保养的技术。教员们说，这次参加水库工程，真是做到了三满意：“人民满意，因为加速了水利工程；学员满意，因为既学会了理论知识，又掌握了操作技术；教员满意，因为丰富了教学内容和经验，提高了教学水平。”
