(Reported by this newspaper) The CCP Fanshen Township General Branch in An’yue County, Sichuan Province, mobilized the masses to self-compile propaganda materials, solving the problem of insufficient supply of propaganda materials and greatly improving the quality of propaganda work.

During the Great Leap Forward in production, the CCP Fanshen Township General Branch organized a propaganda team of more than 500 people to carry out extensive propaganda activities. They immediately encountered the problem of insufficient propaganda materials. After research, the General Branch believed that propaganda work must follow the mass line: not only mobilize the masses to carry out propaganda, but also mobilize the masses to compile propaganda materials. It also put forward the slogan of "take materials locally, compile and use by oneself." Initially, some cadres with superstitious ideas emphasized that the masses had a low level of education and could not compile anything, disbelieving the wisdom and power of the masses. However, Lin Mingxuan, the secretary of the No. 1 Village Branch, actively supported and encouraged the masses to create, and the masses quickly compiled more than 200 ditties, flower drums, and short plays, breaking the superstition that one could not compile propaganda materials without education. Cadres and the masses in other villages, faced with the facts, liberated their minds and also began to create boldly. Now, slogans and ditties are written on walls, roadsides, hillsides, courtyards, and utility poles, and people can hear ditties and clapper talks compiled by the villagers based on their own experiences day and night. Because the themes are real people and real events in the local area, and the form is popular with the masses, the role of education and mobilization is even greater. When planting heaps of sweet potatoes, villager Dai Xuezhong's family of three generations compiled ditties: "It is a good way to open up wasteland and plant sweet potatoes, work hard together, each household increases the planting of ten thousand nests of sweet potatoes, there is food, fuel, and fodder. People and animals are prosperous and life is getting sweeter. This is all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, and we will do everything possible to realize the forty articles." "Make the best use of the land, turn wastelands into treasures, plant heaps of sweet potatoes, like picking up gold." In one and a half days, this village planted an average of 8,500 nests of sweet potatoes per household, and was commended by the county and district committees. After each task is deployed, many propaganda materials created by the masses appear. The Sixth Village compiled during the drought resistance: "Not afraid of the high sky and the long road, not afraid of the high mountains without water sources, everyone follows the Party with one heart, and the high slopes will also become good fields. Plant as many nests as possible, and plant all the rivers, ponds, and abandoned embankments. If there are no rivers or ponds, find submerged areas and dig out 'blue dragons' to add water. If there is really no water, plant drought-resistant grains to ensure a large increase in production."

### 既发动群众作宣传　又发动群众编材料　安岳县翻身乡提高了宣传工作的质量

　　既发动群众作宣传　又发动群众编材料
　　安岳县翻身乡提高了宣传工作的质量
    本报讯　中共四川省安岳县翻身乡总支发动群众自编宣传材料，解决了宣传材料供不应求的困难，大大提高了宣传工作的质量。
    在生产大跃进中，中共翻身乡总支组织了一支五百多人的宣传队伍，广泛开展宣传活动。一开始就遇到宣传材料不足的问题。总支研究后，认为宣传工作必须走群众路线：既要发动群众作宣传，又要发动群众编写宣传材料。并提出“就地取材，自编自用”的口号。最初一部分具有迷信思想的干部，强调群众文化水平低，编不出东西来，不相信群众的智慧和力量。但是，一村支部书记林明轩积极支持和鼓励群众创作，群众很快就编出了二百多首顺口溜、花鼓和短剧，破除了没有文化就不能编写宣传材料的迷信。其他各村的干部和群众在事实面前解放了思想，也先后大胆创作起来。现在，不论在墙壁上、道路边、山头上、院落内、电杆上都写有标语口号、顺口溜，而且白天晚上都可以听到社员们根据自己切身体验编成的顺口溜、金钱板等。由于题材是本地的真人真事，形式又为群众喜闻乐见，因此教育鼓动的作用就更大。在种植堆堆苕时，社员戴学中一家三代都编了顺口溜：“开荒栽苕办法好，齐心合力加劲搞，每户增种万窝苕，有吃有烧有饲料。人畜兴旺日子甜，生活越过越逍遥。这都是共产党的领导好，千方百计实现四十条。”“地尽其力，荒坝翻身，大种堆堆苕，尤如拣黄金。”这个村在一天半的时间内，平均每户栽了八千五百窝堆堆苕，受到了县委、区委的表扬。在每项工作布置后，出现很多群众创作的宣传材料。六村在抗旱中编出：“不怕天高路遥远，不怕高山无水源，大家齐心跟党走，高坡也要变良田。能栽一窝都栽上，要将河凼〔凼（音塘），山沟低洼地积水之处。〕、水沟废塘、废埝齐栽完。无河无塘找浸水，挖出‘青龙’把水添。实在无水点旱谷，也要保证大增产。”
