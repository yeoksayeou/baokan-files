    To compile poetry to fill the sky
    The light switch releases brightness,
    The General Line illuminates my eyes;
    What I see in my eyes, what I think in my heart,
    Is to compile poetry to fill the sky.
    From the creation of the world until now,
    Never seen a farmer become a poet;
    The Chinese Communist Party rises,
    Farmers become authors in droves.
    Singing originates from labor,
    The better the labor, the more the songs,
    Tilling the land requires a good hoe,
    Singing requires a good singer,
    Now everyone is a singer,
    Singing makes the Yangtze River flow backwards.
    Writing poems is not too difficult,
    Breaking superstition is key,
    Mobilize the wisdom of the masses,
    And you can write tens of thousands of poems.
    Compose more,
    Sing more,
    Sing so everyone strives to be the best,
    Sing so red flags are planted everywhere.

### 要编诗歌飞满天

    要编诗歌飞满天
    电灯开关放光明，
    总路线照亮我的眼；
    眼中看来心里想，
    要编诗歌飞满天。
    盘古初分到如今，
    未见农民当诗人；
    中国兴起共产党，
    农民作者集成群。
    唱歌本从劳动起，
    劳动越好歌越多，
    种田要用好锄头，
    唱歌要用好歌手，
    如今歌手人人是，
    唱得长江水倒流。
    要写诗篇不太难，
    打破迷信是关键，
    群众智慧发动起，
    能写诗歌万万篇。
    多多的编，
    多多的唱，
    唱得人人争上游，
    唱得红旗遍地插。
