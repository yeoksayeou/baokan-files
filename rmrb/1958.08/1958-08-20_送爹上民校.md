Sending Dad to a People's School

　　A small lantern is hollow at both ends,
　　Light a candle, red and bright,
　　Dad goes to the people's school at night,
　　I carry the lantern to see him there.
　　Not afraid of the narrow road and many hills,
　　Not afraid of rain or wind,
　　Dad is old but his heart is not,
　　Learning culture is extremely useful.

　  送爹上民校小小灯笼两头空，点上蜡烛红通通，爹爹夜晚上民校，我打灯笼把他送。不怕路窄岗头多，不怕雨来不怕风，爹爹年迈心不老，学习文化顶用功。
