Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Rio de Janeiro News: Brazil's "Workers' Voice" recently published a full-page article listing ten major evils of US Secretary of State Dulles, including undermining peace, creating tension, and interfering in other countries' internal affairs, expressing the Brazilian people's opposition to his visit to Brazil. The article's main title was: "Agent of Wall Street, Get Out!"

The newspaper listed Dulles' ten major evils as follows:

(1) Dulles is the direct planner of the war of aggression against Korea.

(2) Dulles is doing everything possible to restore aggressive imperialism in West Germany, restoring the source of world war in Europe.

(3) Dulles implements a policy of concluding war treaties, uniting world imperialist forces to instigate a world war.

(4) Dulles tries his best to maintain the crumbling remnants of the colonial world with sword and fire.

(5) Dulles is the instigator of the "Cold War." He attempts to develop the "Cold War" into a real war.

(6) Dulles' policy toward Latin America is against the interests of the Latin American people, and his actions show that he is an enemy of the Latin American people. Dulles' policy encouraged the US monopoly enterprise "United Fruit Company" to launch an armed aggression against Guatemala in 1954. Dulles' policy openly supports all dictatorial regimes in Latin America. American foreign policy is not about making friends, but about defending its own interests—this is the slogan Dulles recently personally announced.

(7) Dulles rejected all proposals for world peace put forward by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Dulles was previously against the Geneva summit, and today he is undermining the Soviet proposal for a top-level meeting.

(8) Hitler's old subordinate, Speidel, has recently become the person in charge of the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Dulles and Adenauer are jointly responsible for this matter.

(9) Dulles' actions are against the interests of the American people. The American financier Warburg recently said that Dulles' policies have caused millions upon millions of people around the world to hate the United States.

(10) Dulles himself boasted that his policy was to bring the world to the brink of war once again. He thought this would scare the Soviet Union. The recent invasion of Lebanon by the US military is undoubtedly the most blatant provocation of the Dulles-Eisenhower war policy. This is a naked aggression, a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, and a challenge to all Arab people.

The article, when discussing the purpose of Dulles' visit to Brazil, believes that Dulles' visit may also be related to the new attempts of American monopoly capital on Brazilian oil. "Mobil Oil Company" and other trusts have never forgotten Brazil's oil treasures. Every so often, they come up with new tricks in this regard. "Workers' Voice" said that we cannot allow Rockefeller's company to enslave Brazil.

When talking about the struggle of Brazilian students against Dulles' visit, "Workers' Voice" said that Brazilian students have a glorious tradition of actively participating in the people's patriotic struggle, and they are now answering Dulles' visit to Brazil loudly and forcefully with "No." National Student Union President Meidao Ar said: "We will express to the American leaders our strong opposition to the colonialist policies of the American government. It is our right to do so, and we will never give up this right." Another student leader, Capital Student Union President de Souza, said: "We will use actions to make this uninvited guest clearly understand that Brazil is not the backyard of the United States."

    巴西人民反对美国殖民政策
    “工人呼声报”列举杜勒斯十大罪状
    发动侵朝战争　加紧武装西德　策动世界大战　维持殖民主义　竭力加剧“冷战”
    奴役拉丁美洲　反对和平建议　复活纳粹余孽　危害美国人民　武装干涉中东
    新华社6日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西“工人呼声报”最近以整版篇幅发表文章，列举美国国务卿杜勒斯破坏和平、制造紧张局势和干涉他国内政等十大恶行，表示巴西人民反对他访问巴西。文章的大标题是：“华尔街的代理人滚出去！”。
    这家报纸列举杜勒斯的十大恶行如下：
    （一）杜勒斯是侵略朝鲜的战争的直接策划者。
    （二）杜勒斯尽一切力量在西德恢复侵略性的帝国主义，在欧洲恢复世界战争的策源地。
    （三）杜勒斯执行缔结战争条约的政策，联合世界帝国主义力量策动世界大战。
    （四）杜勒斯极力用剑和火维持土崩瓦解的殖民世界的残余。
    （五）杜勒斯是策动“冷战”的人。他企图把“冷战”发展成真刀真枪的战争。
    （六）杜勒斯对拉丁美洲的政策是违反拉丁美洲人民的利益的，他的行动表明，他是拉丁美洲人民的敌人。杜勒斯的政策鼓励了美国垄断企业“联合果品公司”在1954年发动对危地马拉的武装侵略。杜勒斯的政策公然支持拉丁美洲的一切独裁政权。美国的外交政策不在于交朋友，而是要保卫它自己的利益——这是杜勒斯最近亲自宣布的口号。
    （七）杜勒斯拒绝了苏联和其他社会主义国家提出的一切谋求世界和平的建议。杜勒斯以前是反对日内瓦政府首脑会议的人，今天他又破坏苏联建议的最高级会议。
    （八）希特勒的旧部下斯派达尔最近又成了北大西洋公约组织武装部队的负责人员。对于这件事情，杜勒斯要同阿登纳共同负责。
    （九）杜勒斯所作所为违反美国人民的利益，美国金融家华伯最近说，杜勒斯的政策在全世界引起了千千万万人对美国的痛恨。
    （十）杜勒斯本人曾吹嘘说，他的政策是要把世界再一次带到战争边缘。他以为这样就可以吓唬苏联。美国军队最近侵略黎巴嫩，这无疑是杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔的战争政策的一次最露骨的挑衅。这是一次赤裸裸的侵略，公然破坏联合国宪章的行为，是对全体阿拉伯人民的挑战。
    文章在谈到杜勒斯访问巴西的目的时认为，杜勒斯这次访问也可能同美国垄断资本对巴西石油的新企图有关。“美孚油公司”和其他托辣斯对巴西的石油宝藏从来不曾忘情。他们每隔不多久总要在这方面搞些新花样。“工人呼声报”说，我们不能允许洛克菲勒的公司来奴役巴西。
    “工人呼声报”在谈到巴西学生反对杜勒斯的访问的斗争时说，巴西学生有积极参加人民爱国斗争的光荣传统，他们现在对杜勒斯访问巴西响亮有力地回答说“不行”。全国学生联合会主席麦道阿尔说：“我们将要向美国领导人表示，我们激烈反对美国政府的殖民主义政策。这样做是我们的权利，我们决不放弃这个权利”。另一个学生领袖、首都学生联合会主席德苏萨说：“我们将要用行动使这个不速之客清楚地知道，巴西不是美国的后院”。
