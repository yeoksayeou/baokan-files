　　Vigorously Promote Tool Reform

Following the joint directive from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on rapidly launching a farm tool improvement campaign in rural areas, China's agricultural tool improvement movement has entered a new stage. A new high tide of tool reform movement, centered on ball bearingization and combining invention and creation with popularization and application, is forming across the country. According to recent reports from provinces across the country, most provinces will ball bearingize all their rotating tools within the next one to three months; all regions across the country will improve agricultural production tools and achieve agricultural semi-mechanization within this year.

Rapidly developing and improving China's social productive forces is the most important and urgent task after the basic completion of China's socialist revolution. Replacing all old, heavy agricultural tools with improved, modern agricultural tools is the central link in developing China's agricultural productive forces at present. The mass tool reform movement, participated in by hundreds of millions of farmers, handicraftsmen, and rural cadres, is the only correct path to improve and develop China's agricultural productive forces and lead China's agriculture towards mechanization and modernization.

Due to the great leap forward in agricultural production and various rural construction undertakings, the phenomenon of labor shortage is now appearing everywhere in the vast rural areas. Implementing tool reform and ball bearingizing rotating tools can greatly improve labor efficiency and effectively solve the contradiction between the great leap forward and labor shortage. For example, this year, Jian Guo No.1 Agricultural Cooperative in Maxi River Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, had an experimental plot that created a high yield record of more than 36,000 catties per mu. If the old method of carrying by people and shoulders was used, it would take 350 person-times to transport this bumper harvest of grain; changing this backward method, and using large carts equipped with ball bearings instead of carrying by shoulders, resulted in only one person and one large cart needing to transport it ten times or so. See how powerful tool reform is!

The significance of carrying out the tool reform movement is by no means limited to solving the current problem of "too much production, not enough manpower." The mass tool reform movement also creates conditions and opens up paths for China's agricultural mechanization and modernization. China is a huge agricultural country. Due to its vast territory, the cultivation requirements in various places are very different. When agricultural mechanization is realized in the future, the agricultural machines needed in various places will be diverse in terms of specifications and performance. Where will so many different specifications and performance agricultural machines come from? Some may be created and invented by scientists and engineers. For example, the "electric plow" recently being promoted in Jiangsu, Hebei and other places was invented by comrades from the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Scientists and technical personnel must have a condition, that is, they must go deep into reality and combine with the practice and experience of the masses in order to create more and faster good machines suitable for the production needs of various places. Taking the "electric plow" as an example, the comrades of the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute created the "electric plow" after summarizing and improving the experience of farmers in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, in using rope traction plows. It can be seen that the key to the problem lies with the masses, that is, a mass tool reform movement must be carried out. The mass agricultural tool reform is the germination of agricultural mechanization, and the reason lies here. Precisely because China is such a huge agricultural country, although China's industry is developing very rapidly, it is still impossible to equip the entire country's agricultural production with tractors and other agricultural machines in a very short period of time. To realize agricultural mechanization as soon as possible, a more powerful industry is needed. Only by first making China's agriculture have a great leap forward development can we vigorously promote the great leap forward in industry, produce more and faster large numbers of agricultural machines, and realize agricultural mechanization sooner.

Tool reform, like other work, needs a mass movement to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. The experience of various places proves that as long as cadres, and through cadres, make the broad masses realize the importance and great significance of the tool reform movement, the masses will actively take action and make the whole people participate in the movement, pushing the tool reform movement to a new high tide. At present, party committees at all levels, from the province to the county to the township, have formulated specific tool reform plans based on the specific conditions and production needs of their respective provinces, counties, and townships. What to reform first, what to reform later; how much to reform, and when to complete it, are all specified very specifically. Various places have decided to first install ball bearings on all rotating tools, so that all rotating tools are ball bearingized. Solving this problem first is very necessary. According to surveys, rotating tools are the largest number of tools in agricultural production and agricultural product processing, and the tools that occupy the most labor. Solving the problem of rotating tools can greatly solve the difficulty of labor shortage. Now most areas have paid attention to the principle of closely integrating the tool reform movement with production, and party committees at all levels have conducted a "bottoming out" and "ranking" of the various tools that need to be reformed in their respective regions, distinguishing between the important and the urgent, and carrying out the reform in a planned and step-by-step manner. Now the great autumn is coming, and various places have decided to first reform the harvesting tools, threshing tools, processing tools, and autumn plowing and autumn planting tools. This is the central content of the current tool reform movement, and we must concentrate our efforts and seize the time to do this work well.

Closely combining invention and creation with promotion and application is a new feature of the current tool reform movement. Many regions have put forward the slogan "improve and promote simultaneously, improve one and promote one, use one." This slogan is very good. Because the tool reform movement is related to many aspects, we must pay attention to the cooperation and collaboration of all aspects in order to achieve greater results. In order to strengthen collaboration, party committees at all levels have established unified leadership organizations for the tool reform movement, including all relevant parties such as industry, agriculture, and commerce, in order to carry out work according to the intentions of the party committee. Experience has proven that this approach is correct. Leading the tool reform movement should be like fighting a war, one battle after another. Each battle should solve a specific task. Each battle should be short in time, ranging from seven days to ten days. Many places have adopted this method, and completed the task of ball bearingizing transportation tools in just ten days; in another ten days, they completed the task of ball bearingizing water lifting tools and processing tools. This working method and leadership method should be universally promoted in various places.

With strong political and ideological work, making the masses realize the significance of the tool reform movement, the masses will actively take action. As long as the broad masses participate in the movement, all difficulties will be solved. Many places lack raw materials for manufacturing ball bearings, so they launched a movement of one person or one household one catty of iron, and the raw material problem was immediately solved; there was no technology for manufacturing ball bearings, but there were many people with broad wisdom, and many "capable people" emerged, who could not only manufacture ball bearings, but also manufactured machines for manufacturing ball bearings. With meticulous organizational work, the mass tool reform movement can be developed forward in a planned and step-by-step manner. These two experiences are very important. With strong leadership and a vigorous mass movement, we will definitely be able to realize the ball bearingization of rotating tools in the rural areas of the country this year, and we will definitely be able to realize the reform of all agricultural tools this year.

　　大搞工具改革
    中共中央和国务院联合发出关于迅速在农村展开农具改良运动的指示以后，我国的农业工具改良运动发展到了一个新的阶段。一个以滚珠轴承化为中心的发明创造与推广使用相结合的新的工具改革运动的高潮，正在各地形成。根据最近全国各省所反映的材料表明：大部分省区都将要在最近一两个月或两三个月内，把本地区的一切运转工具滚珠轴承化；全国各个地区都将要在今年之内实行农业生产工具的改良，实现农业半机械化。
    迅速发展和提高我国社会生产力，是我国社会主义革命基本完成以后的一个最重大最迫切的任务。用改良的新式的农业工具，代替一切旧的笨重的农业工具，则是当前发展我国农业生产力的中心环节。由亿万农民、手工业者和广大农村干部参加的群众性的工具改革运动，乃是提高和发展我国农业生产力使我国农业走向机械化、现代化的唯一正确道路。
    由于农业生产和农村各项建设事业的大跃进，目前广大农村到处出现了劳动力不足的现象。实行工具改革，使运转工具滚珠轴承化，就能极大地提高劳动效率，有效地解决大跃进和劳动力不足的矛盾。举例说：今年湖北省麻城县麻溪河乡建国第一农业社有一块试验田，创造了亩产三万六千多斤的高产纪录。如果用人背肩担的老办法，需要用三百五十人次才能把这丰收的粮食运输完；改变这种落后的办法，把肩挑人背改为使用装上滚珠轴承的大车运输，结果只要一个人一辆大车运十来次就运完了。请看，改良工具的威力有多么大！
    开展工具改革运动的意义，绝不仅仅限于解决当前
  “生产太忙，人手不足”的问题。群众性的工具改革运动还为我国农业机械化、现代化创造条件，开辟道路。我国是一个巨大的农业国家。由于幅员广大，各地的耕作要求有很大不同，将来实现农业机械化的时候，各地所需要的农业机器无论规格、性能都会是多种多样的。这样多的规格和性能不同的农业机器从何而来呢？有一些可能是科学家和工程技术人员创造发明的。如最近江苏、河北等地正在推广的“电犁”，就是中国科学院农业机械化研究所的同志发明的。科学技术人员要有一个条件，就是必须深入实际，同群众的实践、群众的经验结合起来，才能够更多更快地创造出适合各地生产需要的好机器。仍以“电犁”为例，农业机械化研究所的同志，就是总结了江苏省奉贤县农民的机器绳索牵引的耕犁经验以后，加以提高才创造了“电犁”。可见问题的关键还在于群众，即必须开展群众性的工具改革运动。群众性的农具改革是农业机械化的萌芽，道理就在这里。正因为我国是这样一个巨大的农业国家，虽然我国工业发展得十分迅速，但要在很短的时间把全国农业生产都用拖拉机和其他的农业机器装备起来，仍然是不可能的。要想早日实现农业机械化，需要有更为强大的工业。只有首先使我国的农业有大跃进的发展，才能有力地促进工业的大跃进，才能更多更快地产生大量的农业机器，农业机械化才能更早地实现。
    工具改革也像其他工作一样，需要大搞群众运动，才能做到多、快、好、省。各地的经验证明：只要使干部并通过干部使广大群众认识了工具改革运动的重要性和巨大意义，群众就会积极行动起来，作到全民动手，把工具改革运动推向新的高潮。目前各级党委，从省到县到乡都已根据本省本县本乡的具体情况和生产需要，作出了具体的工具改革的规划。先改什么，后改什么；改多少，什么时候完成，都规定得十分具体。各地已经决定首先把一切运转工具都安上滚珠轴承，使一切运转工具滚珠轴承化。首先解决这个问题是十分必要的。据调查，运转工具是农业生产和农产品加工工具中数量最大、占用劳动力最多的工具。解决了运转工具的问题，就能够在很大程度上解决劳动力不足的困难。现在大部地区都已注意了使工具改革运动密切结合生产的原则，各级党委都把本地区的各种需要改革的工具，进行了“摸底”和“排队”，分出轻重缓急，有计划有步骤地进行改革。现在大秋就要到了，各地都决定首先把收割工具、脱谷工具、加工工具以及秋耕秋种工具加以改革。这是当前工具改革运动的中心内容，必须集中力量，抓紧时间搞好这个工作。
    把创造发明和推广使用密切结合起来是当前工具改革运动的一个新的特点。很多地区提出了“边改良边推广，改良一种就推广一种、使用一种”的口号。这个口号很好。因为工具改革运动是关连多方面的，必须注意各方面的配合和协作，才能收到更大的效果。为了加强协作，各级党委成立包括工、农、商等各有关方面参加的工具改革运动的统一领导机构，以便根据党委的意图进行工作。经验已经证明这个做法是正确的。领导工具改革运动，应该像打仗一样，一个战役接一个战役地进行。每个战役要解决一个具体的任务。每个战役，时间要短，少则七天多则十天就够了。很多地方采取了这种办法，只十天的工夫便完成了运输工具滚珠轴承化的任务；再一个十天又完成了提水工具和加工工具滚珠轴承化的任务。这种工作方法和领导方法，各地应该普遍推广。
    有了坚强的政治思想工作，使群众认识了工具改革运动的意义，群众就会积极行动起来。只要广大群众参加到运动中来，一切困难就会迎刃而解。很多地方造滚珠轴承缺乏原料，就开展一人或一户一斤铁的运动，原料问题马上解决了；造滚珠轴承没有技术，人多智谋广，很多的“能人”便涌现出来了，他们不仅能造出滚珠轴承，还造出了造滚珠轴承的机器。有了周密的组织工作，就能够使群众性的工具改革运动有计划有步骤地向前发展。这两条经验十分重要。有了坚强的领导和轰轰烈烈的群众运动，我们就一定能够在今年内在全国农村中实现运转工具滚珠轴承化，就一定能够在今年内实现一切农业工具的改革。
