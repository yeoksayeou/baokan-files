According to a report in the *Liberation Daily*, the First Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which has overfulfilled its state plan for forty-four consecutive months, took another leap forward in August after completing its production increase plan for July. The state plan for this month was increased by 2,960 tons of steel compared to the previous month. After the increased production target was determined at the beginning of August, the production task was not normal. Later, seeing the news of the great leap forward in agricultural production published in the newspaper, it greatly encouraged the workers of the third shift, who expressed that steelmaking workers should also "take command" and produce more steel for a great leap forward. Therefore, on the 14th, the workers of the Jia shift made various preparations before the shift. Due to close cooperation in operation, they ensured timely supply of molten iron. In the past, it took two minutes to pour molten iron in front of the furnace, but now it has been shortened to about twenty seconds, greatly shortening the interval between the traveling cranes. At the same time, the traveling cranes were also rationally allocated, and the steel ingot group workers promptly transported the red steel to the steel casting yard. The three shifts also organized a production shock team. As a result, the Jia shift fired the first shot, creating a new shift record of seventy-three heats in eight hours, breaking the previous highest record of seventy-one heats. Then, the Yi shift did not fall behind, exceeding the original plan by one heat, reaching seventy-two heats. Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of all the workers in the three shifts, they created a new national record of two hundred and thirteen heats.

In addition, it is reported that the newly built converter in the expansion project of the Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 produced the first heat of ordinary carbon steel at 6:25 p.m. on the 15th. After technical inspection, it was identified as Grade A high-quality steel.

The expansion project of the Converter Workshop started on June 15th, covering an area of 7,128 square meters. It was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production on September 1st. Thanks to the highly revolutionary heroism of the People's Liberation Army and all the construction workers who supported the capital construction task of this workshop, and the selfless assistance given by the relevant collaborating units in overcoming various difficulties, they finally realized their heroic will of "hard work for sixty days, converter emitting thick smoke."

The Converter Workshop originally had two converters and two cupola furnaces. Due to the need for frequent baking, replacement, and repair of the converter shells, the equipment capacity could not be fully utilized. In order to meet the needs of production development and achieve the city's leap forward target of 1.2 million tons of steel this year, it was decided to expand this workshop. After the completion of the entire expansion task, it can produce 300,000 tons of steel annually, which will play a significant role in ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the annual leap forward target.

When the first heat of steel was poured out of the furnace, soldiers and workshop workers gathered around the fiery furnace to celebrate. The soldiers said: We will sweat more to exchange for more steel to drown the war-mongers. (Attached picture)

### 上钢一厂转炉再创全国纪录　上钢三厂扩建转炉提前出钢

　　上钢一厂转炉再创全国纪录
　　上钢三厂扩建转炉提前出钢
    据解放日报消息  连续四十四个月超额完成国家计划的上钢一厂第一转炉车间，在完成7月份增产计划的基础上，8月份又跃进了一步。本月份的国家计划比上月增加了二千九百六十吨钢。8月初确定了增产任务以后，生产任务不正常，后来看到报上连着登载农业生产大跃进的消息，大大地鼓舞了三班的工人，表示炼钢工人也应“挂帅”，多炼钢来个大跃进，因此14日甲班工人，事前在班前做好各种准备工作，由于在操作中紧密配合，保证铁水及时供应，炉前倒铁水过去需要二分钟，现在缩短到二十秒钟左右，大大缩短了行车的间隔时间。同时又合理的调配行车，磅钢组工人将红钢及时输出铸钢场。三个班还组织了生产突击队，因此甲班打响了第一炮，创造了八小时内出七十三炉的班的新纪录，突破了过去七十一炉的最高纪录。接着乙班也不落后，比原来计划超过一炉，达到七十二炉。由于三班全体工人鼓足了冲天干劲，创造了二百十三炉的全国最高新纪录。
    又讯  上钢三厂转炉车间扩建工程中新建的转炉，15日下午六点二十五分炼出了第一炉普炭钢，经技术检定，为甲类优质钢。
    转炉车间的扩建工程是6月15日开始的，面积共七千一百二十八平方公尺，原定9月1日完工投入生产，由于支援这个车间基建任务的解放军以及全体建筑工人发扬了高度的革命英雄主义精神，有关协作单位也克服种种困难给予无私的援助，终于实现了他们所提出的“苦战六十天，转炉冒浓烟”的豪迈意志。
    转炉车间原有转炉和化铁炉各两座，由于转炉炉壳需要经常烘烤、替换、修理，设备能力不能充分发挥。为了适应生产发展的需要，实现今年全市产钢一百二十万吨的跃进指标，决定扩大这个车间。扩建任务全部完成后，每年可产钢三十万吨。对保证完成和超额完成全年跃进指标，有极大作用。
    当第一炉钢水从炉中倒出时，战士和车间工人在红又旺的炉火旁集会庆祝。战士们说：我们要流更多的汗，换更多的钢水，淹没战争贩子。（附图片）
