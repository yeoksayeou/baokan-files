Chang'an County Properly Adjusts Farmers' Work and Rest
Implements Public Holiday System of One Day Off Every Half Month

(Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Yi Xiao reports: In response to the new situation of agricultural production in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, where farmers are very busy during the busy season and not idle during the slack season due to the great leap forward in agricultural production, agricultural production cooperatives have recently universally implemented a "Great Holiday Public Rest System," where members have one day off every half month to use as they please.

Since last winter, the amount of farmland capital construction in Chang'an County has surged, and land processing has also increased several times compared to the past. The members have endless tasks to do throughout the year, and there is no longer the difference between the past agricultural slack and busy seasons. In the past, they could rest on bad weather days, but now they also have work to do even when it is windy and rainy. At the same time, after 80% of rural women participated in major labor with the establishment of nurseries, collective canteens, and sewing factories in every cooperative. Under these circumstances, many agricultural cooperatives raised the demand for establishing a certain holiday system. In late June, the Chang'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chang'an County People's Committee studied the demands of the masses and proposed a suggestion to trial the great holiday system—one day every half month is freely controlled by the members themselves. Each agricultural cooperative held a member meeting or member representative meeting, combining the discussion of how to further strengthen the planning and organization of production and improve labor efficiency with the discussion of this system. Since its implementation began in July, the cooperatives have been very lively, engaging in large-scale cultural and recreational activities and patriotic health campaigns on public holidays. The general public holidays for each agricultural cooperative are on the 1st and 16th of each month; however, to adapt to the production season, they can be advanced or postponed.

Within a short period of time since the implementation of this system, many benefits have already been seen. Facts have proven that the implementation of the public holiday system has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the members for production. The number of absentees and those asking for leave in each cooperative has significantly decreased, and the attendance rate has greatly increased. Before the implementation of the public holiday system, the Taiping River Agricultural Cooperative had an average attendance rate of no more than 85% because several members always asked for leave to handle private matters every day. Now, the members concentrate their private affairs on the holiday, and the attendance rate has remained above 97% for nearly a month.

The implementation of this system makes it more convenient to arrange production and enables production to proceed rhythmically. Now, many teams organize a stage of production according to the great holiday. For example, the seventeen cooperatives in Wulou Township arranged to complete five tasks from August 1st to 15th: the second top dressing of corn and millet, the elimination of third-class fields, the final stage of deep plowing of vacant land, the improvement of 30,000 agricultural tools, and the accumulation of 50,000 catties of fertilizer per person. Because the production tasks have specific times and specific goals, everyone is counting the days and working hard day by day with special enthusiasm.

Having public holidays also provides time to organize larger-scale cultural and recreational activities. On the holiday of August 1st, the drama troupes and song and dance teams of five cooperatives in Fancun Township performed. Young people in each cooperative also generally organized ball game competitions during the holidays. In the past two weeks, more than two hundred basketball games have been held in various cooperatives throughout the county. Members can better handle private matters without affecting collective production. Ling Zhaofeng, the production captain of the Jinxing Cooperative, and his family had no free time for the past one or two months, and their housework had accumulated a lot. July 15th was the first holiday of their cooperative. Ling Zhaofeng got up early in the morning to build a pigsty for a piglet he had bought two months ago and had been tying with a rope. His wife, Zhang Hailian, is the deputy director of the cooperative. On this day, she rushed to make a new pair of shoe soles for her child and washed a pile of clothes that had been accumulated for a long time. Ling Zhaofeng's sister is the family member of a cadre. She returned to her hometown two months ago to participate in production. Her mother always wanted to see her but did not have time. That day, she also took a basket and went to see her daughter.

The members are particularly excited about spending the great holiday. Many young men and women also put on new clothes on this day. Some elderly people went to Guanyin Mountain, a scenic spot within the county, to climb to the top together, and some young people used this day to get married.

    长安县妥善调节农民劳逸  实行公休制度半月歇一天
    本报讯　记者伊晓报道：陕西省长安县的农业生产合作社针对农业生产大跃进中出现的农忙很忙，农闲不闲的新情况，最近普遍实行了“大礼拜公休制度”，社员们每劳动半个月休假一天。
    自去冬以来，长安县农田基本建设数量激增，土地加工也数倍于过去，社员们一年到头都有作不完的活路，现在已经没有过去那样的农闲、农忙季节的差别了。过去坏天气可以休息，现在刮风下雨也有要干的活。同时，80％的农村妇女在社社建起了托儿所、集体食堂和缝纫工厂以后，也参加了主要劳动。在这种情况下，不少农业社提出了建立一定的假日制度的要求。6月下旬，中共长安县委和长安县人民委员会研究了群众的要求，提出了试行大礼拜制的建议——每半个月有一天由社员自己自由支配。各农业社都举行社员大会或社员代表会议，结合如何进一步加强生产的计划性组织性和提高劳动效率的问题，对这个制度进行了讨论。从7月份开始实行后至今，各社在公休日里大闹文化娱乐和爱国卫生运动，非常热闹。各个农业社一般的公休日都在每月1日和16日；但为了适应生产时机，可以推前或推后。
    这个制度在开始实行的短时间内，已经可以看出有许多好处。事实证明，实行公休制的结果，更刺激了社员生产的积极性，各个社旷工、请假的人显著减少，出勤率大大提高。太平河农业社在实行公休日制以前，因为每天总有几个社员请假去处理私人事情，出勤率平均不超过85％。现在社员们都把要办的私人事集中在礼拜日来办，近一个月的出勤率一直保持在97％以上。
    实行这种制度更便利了安排生产，使生产有节奏地进行。现在许多社队都按大礼拜组织一个阶段的生产。如五楼乡的十七个社在8月1日到15日就安排了要完成第二次玉米、谷子追肥，消灭三类田，空茬地深翻扫尾，改良农具三万件，每人积肥五万斤等五项工作，十五天过后评比。因为生产任务有具体时间、具体目标，大家都掐指头算账，一天紧赶一天，劲头特别足。
    有了公休日也就有了组织较大规模的文化娱乐活动的时间。樊村乡十四个农业社，在8月1日的假日里就有五个社的剧团和歌舞队演了戏。各社青年们并普遍在假日组织球类比赛。近两个礼拜日中，全县各社进行的篮球赛就有二百多次。社员们能在不影响集体生产的条件下，更好地来处理私人的事情。金星社生产队长凌兆丰一家人，过去一两个月没有闲空，家务事积了一大堆。7月15日是他们社的第一个礼拜日，凌兆丰早晨一起来就为在两个月前买来还一直用绳拴着的一头小猪垒猪圈。他的妻子张海莲是社里的副主任，在这一天给孩子赶纳起一双新鞋底，洗了积下好久的一堆衣服。凌兆丰的妹妹是个干部家属，两个月前回乡参加生产，母亲老想去看她又没有空，那天也提上篮子看姑娘去了。
    社员们对过大礼拜感到特别兴奋。不少青年男女这天还穿上了新衣服，有些老年人结伴到县境以内的名胜——观音山去登高，有的青年人利用这一天结婚。
