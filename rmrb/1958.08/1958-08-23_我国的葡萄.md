Agricultural Knowledge

　　Plants of the genus *Vitis* are widely distributed in China. Nationwide, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region cultivates the most grapes, with an area accounting for about half of the country and a yield accounting for 70%. Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan and other provinces also have large cultivation areas. Qingxu in Shanxi and Xuanhua in Hebei are famous grape producing areas.

　　China has many excellent grape varieties, but most are for fresh consumption. Red grapes in southern Xinjiang, Longyan, Milk, Rose Fragrant, and Black Chicken Heart in North China and Northeast China are some of the excellent varieties for fresh consumption. China also has varieties for making dried grapes, which is the "Seedless White" from Turpan, Xinjiang.

　　Grapes have strong adaptability and can be cultivated in plains, hills, and mountainous areas. Many grapes are also cultivated in urban and industrial areas. (Attached picture)

　　Seeing an unprecedented bumper grape harvest, the old members of the Sanxing Second Cooperative are overjoyed.

　　我国的葡萄
    葡萄一属的植物，在我国分布很广。就全国范围说，新疆维吾尔自治区栽培的葡萄最多，面积约占全国的一半，产量占70％。山西、河北、山东、河南等省也有较大栽培面积。山西清徐、河北宣化都是著名的葡萄产区。
    我国优良葡萄品种很多，但多是生食种。南疆地区的红葡萄，华北、东北地区的龙眼、牛奶、玫瑰香、黑鸡心等，就是生食优良品种的一部分。我国也有制干品种，这就是新疆吐鲁番的“无核白”。
    葡萄的适应性较强，平原、丘陵、山区都能栽培。城市和工矿地区栽培葡萄的也不少。（附图片）
    看到葡萄空前丰收，乐煞了三星二社的老社员
