Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The Australian musical and dance artist delegation held its first performance in China tonight in Beijing, achieving great success.

In over two hours, the Australian artists performed thirteen song, dance, and instrumental solo and ensemble pieces. The Australian artists' performance of folk songs full of Australian local flavor and ballet with distinct national characteristics was warmly welcomed by the audience, with many pieces repeated at the audience's request. Famous Australian singers and pianists also performed French and Italian folk songs, as well as famous piano pieces by Chopin and Beethoven. At the end of the performance, the Australian artists received flowers from representatives of Beijing's literary and art circles.

Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Vice President Ding Xilin, and more than a thousand prominent figures from Beijing's literary and art circles watched tonight's performance. During the intermission, Chu Tunan and Ding Xilin met with John Rodgers, the head of the artist delegation. Chu Tunan and Xu Guangxiao went on stage after the performance to shake hands with the Australian artists.

Before the performance began, Xu Guangxiao, Standing Director of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and head of the Chinese art troupe that visited Australia in 1956, and Rodgers, the head of the Australian artist delegation, both gave speeches.

Xu Guangxiao said that the friendship that Australian friends expressed to us when the Chinese art troupe visited various cities in Australia is still deeply remembered by us. Receiving the Australian art troupe in Beijing today symbolizes a further development of the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Australian peoples, and we believe that this visit will help enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples.

Rodgers said that as the first Australian artists to visit China, they felt proud and excited. He said that in terms of ancestry, Australians are Europeans, but geographically, Australia is part of Asia, and we are deeply aware that our future is linked to the future of Asia, especially China. We look forward to living in peace and friendship with the 600 million Chinese people.

Xu Guangxiao held a reception after the entire performance to congratulate the Australian artists on their successful performance. At the reception, the Australian artists met with prominent artists from Beijing.
