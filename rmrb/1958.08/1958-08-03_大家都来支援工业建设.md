Everyone Come and Support Industrial Construction

	In the streets and alleys of Beijing, stalls for supporting industry and collecting scrap copper and iron have appeared. The neighbors are rummaging through boxes and cabinets, clearing out waste, and selling copper and iron utensils that have been hidden at home for many years to the recycling stations. Auntie Li sold a copper incense burner, Auntie Liu sold a copper kettle; and Auntie Xu simply sold the large iron cabinet at home and replaced it with a wooden one... They all said that since there is a great leap forward in industry, factories are being set up everywhere, and steel and iron are needed everywhere. If these factories all reach out to the state for steel and iron, where would the state have so many readily available things lying around? Since we are the masters of the country, we have a responsibility to solve this kind of difficulty and are happy to take out these copper and iron things at home to support industrial construction.

	However, some aunties still don't quite understand this principle, preferring to keep the useless copper and iron things rather than sell them. Some say: "Selling scrap is too embarrassing. The money earned is not much, but you lose face." Some say: "Living at home, there is nothing that is not useful. Keeping things on hand, if you don't use them today, you can use them tomorrow, how convenient!" Others say: "The bits and pieces of scrap copper and iron at home don't amount to much, the country doesn't rely on this."

	These statements only see one side of the matter, without thinking about what is more beneficial to the country. Selling "scrap" is to support industrial construction, and it is unwillingness to sit idly by and watch the water boiling in our factories without "rice" to cook. The socialist enthusiasm of Auntie Li, Auntie Liu, and Auntie Xu in actively selling "scrap" cannot be bought with any amount of money. Everyone says they are doing the right thing, and no one says they are embarrassed.

	Of course, it is convenient to have all kinds of furniture at home. But some things are not currently used at home, such as copper incense burners. Which family still needs them nowadays? But the country is waiting for copper right away! Selling scrap, turning dead objects into living objects, and exchanging them for money is precisely "benefiting the country and benefiting oneself."

	Our average family, almost everyone has a pound or two of scrap copper and iron. At first glance, these are indeed bits and pieces and don't amount to much. But if we take the entire city of Beijing, with more than 1.1 million households, and assume each family has an average of two pounds of scrap copper and iron, the entire city would have more than two million pounds. If everyone pools together, wouldn't it be "gathering little to make much, accumulating fur into a robe?"

	Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the upsurge of the whole party and the whole people running industry is surging across the country, and raw materials such as steel are becoming particularly needed. This situation in industry is just like hoping for clouds and rain during a long drought in agriculture. In order to support industrial construction, let's all "fight the drought"!

### 大家都来支援工业建设

    大家都来支援工业建设
    北京的街头巷尾，出现了一个个支援工业、收购废铜铁的摊头。街坊们这个翻箱倒柜、那个清理废物，把家里藏了多年的铜铁器具，都卖给了收购站。李大嫂卖的是铜香炉，刘大妈卖的是铜壶；还有许大婶，索性把家里的大铁柜也卖了，换了个木头柜……。她们都说，工业大跃进嘛，到处都在办工厂，哪里都需用钢铁，假若这些工厂都伸手向国家要钢要铁，国家哪儿有那么多现成的东西在撂着？咱们既是国家的主人，就有责任来解决这号困难，乐意把家里这些铜呀铁的东西拿出来支援工业建设。
    可是，也有些大妈们还不大明白这个道理，宁可把用不着的铜铁东西放着也不愿意卖。有的说：“卖破烂，太寒伧。卖的钱不多，反倒丢了面子。”有的说：“居家过日子，没有用不着的东西。把东西留在手头，今天不用明天用，多灵便！”还有的说：“家里这零星半点破铜烂铁，算不了什么，国家不指靠这个。”
    这些说法，都只是看到事情的一面，没有想到怎么样才是对国家更有利。卖“破烂”是为了支援工业建设，是不愿意眼睁睁地看着我们的工厂里的水开了而没有“米”下锅。像李大嫂、刘大妈和许大婶她们这种积极卖“破烂”的社会主义热情，是花多少钱也买不着的，谁都说她们做的对，从没人说她们寒伧。
    家庭过日子，家具样样齐全当然方便。可是有些东西家里现在并没用，例如铜香炉，现今哪家还用得着？可是国家可马上就等着铜用哩！卖了破烂，把死物变成活物，换回钱来，正是“功在国家，利在自己”。
    咱们一般家庭，差不多谁都有个斤把两斤废铜烂铁。乍一看，这的确是零星半点的，算不了什么。可是如果拿北京市全市一百一十多万户来算，平均一家有两斤废铜铁，全市就有二百多万斤。大家汇总在一块，岂不是“凑少成多，集腋成裘”了吗？
    在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全党全民办工业的热潮正在全国各地汹涌澎湃，钢铁等原材料也就愈显得特别需要。工业上的这种情况，正好比农业中的久旱盼云霓。为了支援工业建设，咱们大家都来“抗旱”吧！
