Notes

    To Create Tension
    According to a report in the British journal "The Economist," Franco's Spain and the United States have secretly agreed to place the three largest U.S. air bases in Spain—the Torrejón base near Madrid, the Morón base near Seville in the south, and the Zaragoza base in the north—under the U.S. Strategic Air Command's "fifteen-minute alert" system. U.S. aircraft at these bases must be in a state of combat readiness day and night, and U.S. patrol aircraft taking off from these bases will carry nuclear weapons. The Spanish authorities will provide all conveniences.
    As "The Economist" magazine pointed out, the fascist dictator Franco dedicated Spanish territory to the United States in order for "the North Atlantic group to finally accept Spain as a member state." In any case, this is an act of betrayal for the Spanish people, and they will not agree to it.
    The exposure of the secret US-Spanish agreement also reveals the US ruling clique's increasingly intensified war preparations. The facts once again prove that the American warmongers are deliberately expanding their "fifteen-minute alert" system, attempting to keep international tensions in a state of boiling.

    为了制造紧张
    据英国“经济学家”周刊报道，佛朗哥西班牙和美国已经秘密协议，把美国在西班牙的三个最大空军基地——马德里近郊的土勒荣基地、南部塞维尔附近的摩隆基地和北部的塞拉哥萨基地，置于美国战略空军司令部的“十五分钟警戒”制度下。在这些基地上的美国飞机日夜都要处于备战状态，从这些基地起飞的美国巡逻飞机，都将带有核武器。而西班牙当局则给以一切方便。
    正如“经济学家”杂志所指出的，法西斯独裁者佛朗哥把西班牙的国土所以奉献给美国，是为了“北大西洋集团终于接受西班牙为成员国”。不管如何，对于西班牙人民来说，这是一种出卖行为，他们是不会答应的。
    美西秘密协定的暴露也同时揭穿了美国统治集团日益加紧的备战活动。事实又一次证明，美国战争狂人是在处心积虑地扩大它的“十五分钟警戒”制度，企图把国际紧张局势保持在沸腾状态。
