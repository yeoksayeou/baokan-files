　　At a time when all regions are seizing industrial production, seizing the "Marshal" of steel, leaping forward again and again, and striving to complete and overfulfill national plans, Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, has further promoted the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration and vigorously supported regions with weaker industrial foundations. This is good news to guarantee the overall great leap forward of China's industrial production.
　　Now, "the whole Party runs industry, and the whole people run industry" has become a vigorous and practical movement, and the enthusiasm of all regions for developing industry has greatly increased. Along with the great development of industry in various regions, the need for technical equipment and technical strength has greatly increased. On the basis of the unbalanced industrial development in China in the past, how can we adapt to the current rapidly increasing need for technical equipment and technical strength? This requires efforts in two aspects. On the one hand, we must rely on the hard work and self-reliance of various regions; on the other hand, we must rely on various regions to overcome all difficulties and support each other. To achieve this goal, we must highly promote the spirit of communist collaboration. Not only should we mobilize forces from all sides within a province, a city, or a region to organize large-scale collaboration, but we should also mobilize forces from all sides between provinces and provinces, cities and cities, provinces and cities, and this region and that region to organize large-scale collaboration. Only large-scale collaboration can exchange what one has for what one lacks, complement each other's weaknesses, and solve the problem of insufficient technical equipment and technical strength in industrial construction and industrial production. Collaboration is the noble style of communism. Shanghai's vigorous assistance to new industrial bases is an example of this communist spirit of collaboration.
　　The example of Shanghai tells us that, under the premise of "taking steel as the key link," guaranteeing the overall great leap forward in industry and completing the national unified plan is our top political task. After a new situation of overall leap forward with steel as the key link appeared in all parts of the country and East China, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China determined that, under the principle of "not squeezing out the original tasks," it would make every effort within the year to produce complete sets of smelting equipment with an annual output of three million tons of pig iron, three million six hundred thousand tons of steel, two million eight hundred thousand tons of steel products, fifteen thousand machine tools, and five hundred and forty thousand kilowatts of power generation equipment. This shows that the Shanghai Municipal Committee first ensured the collaborative tasks given by the state, that is, first ensured the completion of the national plan, and at the same time organized the city's large-scale collaboration, fully tapped its potential, and ensured the completion of new tasks to support brother provinces and regions across the country. They also followed the principle of prioritizing urgent needs and then less urgent needs, first ensuring the technical equipment and power equipment needed for the development of the steel and machinery industries, and then general industrial equipment. In this way, they grasped the key points, avoided blind supply, and not only developed Shanghai's industrial production and realized the national unified plan, but also helped brother provinces and regions to jointly develop new industrial bases and complete the national overall plan. It can be seen that developing local industry, completing national plans, and collaborative tasks are a unified and contradictory overall task of building socialism. Any province, city, or enterprise unit should, in the spirit of self-reliance and mutual support, on the one hand, ensure that the support tasks are included in their own leap forward plans and completed on time for brother provinces, regions, or units that have collaborative tasks. On the other hand, those who can give full play to their potential and be self-reliant should take timely measures, mobilize the masses, organize production, and solve their own needs. In this way, we can not only ensure the completion of national plans and collaborative tasks, but also develop our own enterprises, reduce the heavy tasks of cities or units with collaborative relationships, and jointly strive to accelerate socialist construction.
　　All collaborative units must strictly act in accordance with the general guideline of "centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and collaboration." The state's overall arrangements are a condition for ensuring the planned and proportionate development of socialist construction. Any disruption of overall arrangements is a violation of the general guideline of "centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and collaboration." Shanghai's experience proves that there must be a rational division of labor in order to better complete collaborative tasks. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly educated cadres throughout the city to proceed from the overall situation, enthusiastically and unreservedly impart their technical experience to factories in the interior, provide various technical data, and help the interior rapidly develop technical strength. They said, "We are competitors, but even more so, we are close brothers," and "Collaborate thoroughly and support to the end." They acted in this spirit, and when other provinces and cities had difficulties, they resolutely supplied crucial components such as impellers, blades, punched sheets, and magnetic poles, which were originally intended for their own production, to Beijing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Nanchang, and other places for the manufacture of power generation equipment; and they transferred a group of workshop directors, technicians, and skilled workers to support Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and other places. At the same time, they worked even harder to develop in the direction of high-level, precision, and large-scale products. In this way, on the one hand, they can selflessly help brother provinces and regions overcome difficulties and build new industrial bases with technical experience, technical data, technical equipment, and technical strength; on the other hand, they can spur themselves on, improve their level, and advance towards cutting-edge technology, so as to better collaborate with brother provinces and regions, fully guarantee the completion of national tasks, and accelerate the speed of socialist construction. This is the good effect of division of labor and collaboration under overall arrangements. Any province, city, and enterprise unit should, in accordance with the principle of division of labor and collaboration, organize collaboration in a province, a city, and a region, and gradually rebuild, expand, or newly build the local large, medium, and small enterprises according to the actual situation, make appropriate division of labor arrangements for the production of certain products, and establish new collaborative relationships. In this way, it is possible to truly achieve self-reliance and mutual support, so as to realize the universal great leap forward of industry in various regions.
　　The reason why Shanghai has been able to overcome all difficulties and do everything possible to help brother provinces and regions build new industrial foundations is mainly because it has carried out ideological education, realized political command, and inserted the red flag of communist collaboration. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has continuously criticized incorrect ideas and practices, put forward correct guidelines and slogans, and paid special attention to educating cadres to overcome various departmentalist ideas and promote the spirit of communist collaboration. Affirmative principles and clear guidelines have unified more than a thousand units in the city to join the great leap forward in completing national plans and collaborative tasks.
　　The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the issue of how to reasonably divide labor with the interior, timely educated cadres to clearly understand the relationship between the overall situation and the local situation; on the issue of collaborating and supporting brother provinces and regions, it timely and severely criticized the idea of ​​emphasizing difficulties and refusing to actively undertake more support tasks. In this way, with politics in command and the communist collaboration ideology established, the enthusiasm soared to the sky, and arduous tasks could be completed as they came along. This is a good experience that deserves to be promoted. Erroneous ideas and practices such as treating collaboration contracts as waste paper and "crossing them out with one stroke" are completely untenable. Lenin said in the "Report on the Question of War and Peace" that the great task of socialist construction is to transform "the entire state economic machinery into one huge machine, into an economic organism in which hundreds of millions of people act according to one plan." One of the basic points of the Party's general line for socialist construction is to "simultaneously develop central industry and local industry, and simultaneously develop large-scale enterprises and medium- and small-scale enterprises, under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and collaboration." At a time when the state has improved the industrial management system and various regions are actively developing local industry, any action that deviates from the general line is not allowed. All regions should seize the issue of collaboration, launch a mass debate, educate cadres and workers to clearly recognize the communist principle of collaboration, and do their best to meet the requirements of others and provide assistance; they should strive to tap potential and be self-reliant for their own needs. We must regard self-reliance and mutual support as a dialectical relationship, put our own local interests under the overall interests of the country, strive to overcome difficulties ourselves without affecting the national plan; and regard the difficulties of others as our own difficulties and the needs of others as our own needs, actively support each other, help each other, and do everything possible to complete and overfulfill national plans and collaborative tasks.
　　Two-thirds of the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan is about to pass. Time waits for no one. Let us pull down the white flag of departmentalism, insert the red flag of mutual assistance and collaboration, promote the noble style of communist collaboration, work together under centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and collaboration, and fully guarantee the overfulfillment of national plans and collaborative tasks!

### 大协作是完成国家计划的有力保证

　　大协作是完成国家计划的有力保证
    在各地抓紧工业生产、抓紧钢铁“元帅”，跃进再跃进，力争完成和超额完成国家计划的时候，我国最大的工业城市上海进一步发扬了共产主义的大协作精神，大力支援工业基础较弱的地区。这是保证我国工业生产全面大跃进的喜讯。
    现在“全党办工业，全民办工业”已经成为轰轰烈烈的实际运动，各地发展工业的积极性大大高涨。随着各地工业大发展而来的，就是技术设备和技术力量的需要大大增长。而在我国过去工业发展不平衡的基础上，怎样才能适应目前迅速增长的技术设备和技术力量的需要呢？这就要从两方面来努力。一方面要依靠各地穷干苦干，自力更生；又一方面要依靠各地排除万难，互相支援。为了达到这个目的，就要高度发扬共产主义的协作精神。不但要在一省、一市、一个地区之内发动各方面的力量组织大协作；并且要在省与省、市与市、省与市、这个地区和那个地区之间发动各方面的力量组织大协作。只有大协作，才能互通有无，互补短长，解决工业建设和工业生产的技术设备和技术力量不足的问题。协作是共产主义的高尚风格。上海对于新工业基地的大力帮助，就是这种共产主义协作之风的一个范例。
    上海的例子告诉我们：在“以钢为纲”的前提下，保证工业全面大跃进，完成国家的统一计划，是我们的头等政治任务。在全国各地和华东地区出现了以钢为纲的全面跃进的新形势以后，中共上海市委就确定了在“不挤掉原有任务”的原则下，年内再千方百计地生产年产三百万吨生铁、三百六十万吨钢、二百八十万吨钢材的成套冶炼设备、一万五千台机床和五十四万瓩发电设备等等。这就说明，上海市委首先确保的是国家给予的协作任务，就是说首先保证完成国家计划，同时组织全市的大协作，充分发掘潜力，确保完成支援全国兄弟省、区的新任务。他们还按照先急后缓的原则，先保证发展钢铁和机械工业所需要的技术设备和电力的技术设备，然后才是一般工业设备。这样抓住了重点，避免了盲目供应，既发展了上海的工业生产，实现了国家统一安排的计划；同时又帮助了兄弟省、区，共同发展新的工业基地，完成国家的全面计划。由此可见，发展地方工业、完成国家计划和协作任务，是对立统一的建设社会主义的整体任务。任何省市和企业单位都应该本着自力更生和互相支援的精神，一方面对于有协作任务的兄弟省区或单位，必须保证把支援任务列入自己的跃进计划之中，按时完成。另一方面，凡是能够发挥自己潜力、自力更生的，就及时采取措施，发动群众，组织生产，解决自己的需要。这样，既能够确保国家计划和协作任务的完成，又能够发展自己的企业，减轻有协作关系的城市或单位的繁重任务，共同为加速社会主义建设而努力。
    一切协作单位必须严格按照“集中领导，全面规划，分工协作”的总方针行事。国家的统筹安排，是保证社会主义建设事业有计划按比例发展的条件。任何破坏统筹安排的，都是违背“集中领导，全面规划，分工协作”的总方针的。上海的经验证明，要有合理分工，才能更好地完成协作任务。上海市委及时教育全市干部从全局出发，热心地毫无保留地向内地工厂传授自己的技术经验，提供各种技术资料，帮助内地迅速发展技术力量。他们说“是竞赛的对手，更是亲密的兄弟”，“协作到家，支援到底”。他们就在这种精神下行动起来，在其它省市有了困难的时候，就坚决地把为了自己生产的一部分叶轮、叶片、冲片、磁极等关键性部件，供给北京、武汉、杭州、南京、南昌等地制造发电设备；并抽调一批车间主任、技术人员和技术工人去支援浙江、河南、湖北、内蒙古、青海等地。同时自己更加努力向着高级、精密、大型的产品方向发展。这样，一方面能够大公无私地把技术经验、技术资料、技术设备和技术力量帮助兄弟省、区克服困难，建设新的工业基地；另一方面又能够鞭策自己，提高水平，向尖端技术进军，从而更好地同兄弟省、区协作，全力保证国家任务的完成，加快社会主义建设的速度。这就是在统筹安排下分工协作的良好效果。任何省市和企业单位都应该根据分工协作的原则，在一省、一市、一地区组织协作，并把当地的大、中、小企业按照实际情况，逐步加以改建、扩建或从新兴建，把某些产品的生产作好适当的分工安排，建立新的协作关系。这样，才有可能真正做到自力更生和互相支援，以实现各地工业的普遍大跃进。
    上海之所以能够排除万难、千方百计地帮助兄弟省、区建设新的工业基础，主要是由于进行了思想教育，实现了政治挂帅，插上了共产主义协作的红旗。上海市委不断批判不正确的思想和作法，提出正确的方针和口号，特别注意了教育干部克服各种本位主义思想，发扬共产主义协作精神。肯定的原则，明确的方针，使全市一千多个单位统一组织起来，投入了完成国家计划和协作任务的大跃进行列。
　　上海市委对于如何与内地合理分工的问题，及时地教育干部明确认识全局和局部的关系；对于协作支援兄弟省、区的问题，及时严厉地批判了强调困难，不肯积极承担更多支援任务的思想。这样，政治挂了帅，树立了共产主义协作思想，干劲就冲天而起，繁重的任务就能够随着完成。这是值得推广的良好经验。那些把协作合同视同废纸，“一笔勾消”等错误的想法和做法完全站不住脚。列宁在“关于战争与和平问题的报告”中说过，社会主义建设的巨大任务，就是要把“全部国家经济机构变成为一整架大机器，变成为一个使几万万人都遵照一个计划动作的经济机体”。党的社会主义建设总路线的基本点之一，就是“在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举”。在国家改进了工业管理体制、各地积极发展地方工业的时候，任何离开总路线的行动，都是不能容许的。各地应该抓住协作问题，开展一次群众性的大辩论，教育干部和职工明确地认识共产主义的协作原则，对别人的要求要尽力满足，尽力予以协助；对自己的需要就要努力挖掘潜力，自力更生。要把自力更生和互相支援看成是辩证的关系，把自己的局部利益放在国家的整体利益之下，力求自己克服困难，而不影响国家计划；把别人的困难却要当作自己的困难，把别人的需要看成自己的需要，积极支援，互相帮助，想尽一切办法，完成和超额完成国家计划和协作任务。
    第二个五年计划的头一年，快要过去三分之二了。时不我待，让我们拔掉本位主义的白旗，插上互助协作的红旗，发扬共产主义协作的高尚风格，在集中领导，全面规划，分工协作下共同努力，全力保证超额完成国家计划和协作任务吧！
