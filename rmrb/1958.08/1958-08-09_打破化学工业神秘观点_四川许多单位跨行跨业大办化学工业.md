Shattering the Mystique of the Chemical Industry
Sichuan Many Units Across Industries Vigorously Develop the Chemical Industry

(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 7th dispatch, reporter Ji Xichen) Sichuan Province's many departments have shattered the superstitious view that only professional chemical systems can run the chemical industry, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously develop the chemical industry across different sectors.

Many non-chemical production units are utilizing existing resources, equipment, and manpower to create chemical products in large quantities. After overcoming the idea that coal mines should only produce coal and not care about by-products, Tianfu and Yongchuan coal mines extract coal tar from coal and refine ammonium sulfate from high-sulfur gravel. In order to fully utilize salt brine and natural gas resources and accelerate the development of the chemical industry, Zigong City's salt factories are universally extracting chemical products from salt brine. The First Salt Factory alone has produced eleven kinds of chemical products using indigenous methods, including ammonium bicarbonate and copper sulfate. The city's chemical products have increased from only eight kinds in the past few years to more than twenty kinds this year, and the proportion of chemical output value in the total salt industry output value has increased from 22% to about 50%.

All resources that can be utilized are being utilized in the development of the chemical industry. Qinggang wood, which was consistently used as firewood in the past, has recently been put to good use by Hou Zengqun and others from the Nanchong County Technical Guidance Group's chemists. They used pot distillation, cooling, and decomposition methods to extract chemical products such as wood tar, acetone, methanol, and acetic acid from wood vinegar. Sugar factories' alcohol workshops in Neijiang, Zizhong, and other places utilize steam during the sugarcane off-season, adding some distillation equipment to extract acetone, butanol, glycerin, glucose, and citric acid from sweet potatoes in large quantities.

The fact that some "outsiders" are running chemical industries across different sectors has shattered the mystical view that only specialized personnel can run the chemical industry. The Dongfeng Chemical Plant, established by the Nanchong Special District Commercial Bureau, was initially started by six salespersons. In order to meet the demand for chemical raw materials in local industries, they used crude equipment such as ceramic vats, old oil drums, iron pots, and small earthen stoves to trial-produce sixteen chemical products such as sodium sulfide, bleaching powder, casein, and methanol, eight of which have been officially put into production. With the strong support of the leadership, this factory recently plans to build twelve new chemical workshops for dry distillation, fragrances, reclaimed rubber, etc., striving to produce more than 800 tons of sulfuric acid, baking soda, and other products by the end of the year.

    打破化学工业神秘观点
    四川许多单位跨行跨业大办化学工业
    本报成都7日电  记者纪希晨报道：四川省许多部门打破办化学工业非专业化工系统不可的迷信观点，采用土洋结合办法，跨行跨业大办化学工业。
    许多非化工生产单位，利用原有的资源、设备和人力大量创造化工产品。天府、永川煤矿克服煤矿只管产煤不关心副产品的思想以后，从煤中提取煤焦油，从含硫较高的碎石中提炼出硫酸铵。自贡市为充分利用盐卤和天然气资源，加速发展化学工业，各个盐厂普遍从盐卤中提炼化工产品，仅第一盐厂就用土法制成了碳酸氢氨、硫酸铜等十一种化工产品。全市化工产品过去几年只有八种，今年已达二十多种，化工产值占盐业总产值的比例已从22％上升到50％左右。
    发展化学工业中一切可能利用的资源都被利用起来。过去一贯被当作柴烧的青杠木，最近被南充县技术指导组的化验员侯增群等，找到了好用途。他们用顶锅蒸馏、冷却和分解办法，从木醋液中提炼出木焦油、丙酮、甲醇、醋酸等化工产品。内江、资中等地糖厂的酒精车间，利用蔗糖停工期间的蒸气，添置部分蒸馏设备，从红苕中大量提炼丙酮、丁醇、甘油、葡萄糖和柠檬酸。
    一些“外行”跨行跨业办化工的事实，打破了只有专门人材才能办化工的神秘观点。南充专区商业局创办的东风化工厂，最初就是由六个营业员搞起来的。他们为满足地方工业所需的化工原料，利用瓷缸、旧油桶、铁锅、小土炉等简陋设备，试制成硫化碱、漂白粉、干酪素、甲醇等十六种化学产品，其中有八种已正式投入生产。在领导大力支持下，这个厂最近计划新建干馏、香精、再生胶等十二个化工车间，争取到年底生产硫酸、小苏打等八百多吨。
