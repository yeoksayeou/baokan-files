    A Deplorable Path
    Under the manipulation of Adenauer's party, the West German Federal Parliament passed a decision to abolish the law prohibiting the Hitler Nazi Party. From then on, Hitler's former disciples and grandchildren were once again openly and legally active in West Germany.
    Twenty-five years ago, Hitler's Nazi party members held a torchlight parade in Berlin to celebrate Hitler's rise to power, marking the beginning of the darkest days in German history. Today, Adenauer is also following this old path.
    In fact, many Nazi war criminals in West Germany who had slaughtered innocent people have long been released from prison and are being relied upon by the Adenauer government, riding on the backs of the people once again. As for those peace fighters who strive for freedom, democracy, and resolutely safeguard the national interests of Germany, Adenauer also followed in Hitler's footsteps, using fascist suppression and persecution. It illegally banned the German Communist Party; searched and arrested progressives; suppressed the workers' movement and the peace movement. The West German government has announced a ban on holding referendums against atomic armament, and Justice Minister Schäffer even publicly demanded the death penalty for those who politically oppose the Adenauer regime.
    Obviously, those who are actively reviving German militarism are fantasizing about reliving Hitler's old dreams. However, they are too forgetful; they have forgotten Hitler's end. Those who ultimately brought about Hitler's demise will inflict an even more tragic end on Hitler's disciples and grandchildren. The path taken by West German militarists is nothing more than a deplorable one.

    可悲的道路
    西德联邦议院在阿登纳党操纵下通过了一项取消禁止希特勒纳粹党的法律的决定。从此，过去希特勒的徒子徒孙们又重新在西德公开地和合法地活动起来了。
    二十五年前，希特勒的纳粹党徒为庆祝希特勒上台在柏林举行火炬游行，开始了德国历史上最黑暗的日子。而今天阿登纳也在走着这一条老路。
    其实在西德许多曾经屠杀过无辜人民的纳粹战犯也早已从监狱中被释放出来，受到阿登纳政府的重用，重新又骑到人民的头上了。而对于那些争取自由、民主以及坚决维护德国民族利益的和平战士，阿登纳也步希特勒的后尘，使用了法西斯镇压和迫害。它非法禁止了德国共产党；搜查和逮捕进步人士；压制工人运动和和平运动。西德政府已宣布禁止举行反对原子武装的公民投票，司法部长谢菲尔甚至公开要求对那些在政治上反对阿登纳政权的人处以死刑。
    显然，那些积极复活德国军国主义的人是妄想重温希特勒的旧梦。可是，他们过于健忘了，他们忘记了希特勒的下场。曾经使希特勒终于复亡的人们，将会使希特勒的徒子徒孙们得到更为悲惨的下场的。西德的军国主义者走的不过是一条可悲的道路而已。
