Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 30th: Iraqi Republic Supreme Power Committee Member Kubba said to Xinhua reporters on the morning of July 30th, "We Iraqis and all Arabs truly do not know how to thank the People's China for the lofty and friendly attitude it has taken towards all the liberation movements that have occurred in the Arab world."

He pointed out that the attitude taken by the People's China, whether during the aggression against Egypt or later during the aggression against the United Arab Republic, has been the same as its attitude towards the recent Iraqi liberation movement. He said, "Without a doubt, this lofty attitude makes a very deep impression on people."

Kubba pointed out, "The attitude taken by the People's China is important for stopping aggressors, because it occupies a very important position among the countries of the world, and in terms of its manpower and material resources, it has factors that can stop aggressors and make them think twice before taking action. Therefore, we attach great importance to its attitude and are very grateful for it."

When talking about the Chinese government's recognition of the Iraqi Republic and the Chinese people's full support for the Iraqi Republic government, Kubba said, we thank your government, because the feelings expressed by your government are consistent with the direction of our national movement. He said, "The purpose of our movement is to oppose corruption, whether internally or externally."

Kubba finally said to Xinhua reporters, "The development of the Iraqi regime will enable us in the future to establish political, commercial, and economic relations with all countries in the world on an equal footing and on the basis of mutually beneficial economic cooperation without discrimination."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 30th: A delegation from the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council will depart from Cairo on August 3rd for Baghdad to express its respect to the Iraqi Republic authorities for the success of the Iraqi people's revolution and the strengthening of the unity between the Iraqi people and the Afro-Asian people.

At a meeting on the 30th, the Secretariat decided that the delegation would consist of three people, led by Yang Shuo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council and Chinese writer. The members are Osende Afana, Cameroonian Secretary of the Secretariat, and Saleh Abdul Hafiz, member of the Egyptian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and member of the Egyptian National Assembly.

At the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo last December, the delegation representing Iraq at the conference was led by Hadid, the current Minister of Finance of the Iraqi Republic government. Two members of the delegation were Omar, the current Minister of Education, and Shangshal, the Minister of National Guidance of the new government.

    伊拉克最高权力委员会委员库巴
    感谢我国崇高友谊
    新华社巴格达30日电　伊拉克共和国最高权力委员会委员库巴30日上午对新华社记者说：“我们伊拉克人和所有阿拉伯人真不知道怎样感谢人民中国对于阿拉伯世界发生的一切解放运动所采取的崇高和友好的态度。”
    他指出，人民中国不管是在埃及受到侵略期间以及后来阿拉伯联合共和国受到侵略时所采取的态度，还是在最近对伊拉克解放运动所采取的态度都是一样的。他说：“毫无疑问，这种崇高的态度给人以非常深刻的印象”。
    库巴指出，“人民中国所采取的态度，对于制止侵略者是重要的。因为它在世界各国中占有非常重要的地位，并且在它的人力和物力方面有着制止侵略者们并且使他们在采取行动之前不得不多多考虑的因素。因此，我们非常重视它的态度，并且非常感谢它”。
    库巴在谈到中国政府承认伊拉克共和国和中国人民全力支持伊拉克共和国政府的时候说，我们感谢你们的政府，因为你们的政府所表达的感情同我们的民族运动的方向是一致的。他说：“我们的运动的目的是要反对腐败现象，不管是在内部或在外部”。
    库巴最后对新华社记者说：“伊拉克政权的发展将使我们在将来能够在平等的基础上和在经济互利的基础上毫无区别地同世界上一切国家建立政治、商业和经济关系。”
