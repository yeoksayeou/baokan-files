    About "Crown Prince"
    Some readers, upon reading about the Iraqi revolutionary masses killing Crown Prince Ira of Iraq, wrote to ask: "What does 'Crown Prince' mean?" A brief reply is provided below:
    A Crown Prince is the person who is preparing to inherit the throne after the death of the king. The Crown Prince is usually the son of the king, but sometimes the throne is inherited by a relative of the king. The former Iraqi Crown Prince Ira was the uncle of the former King Faisal II.
