    We Need Good Farm Tools for Harvesting Root Crops
    This year we are advocating the large-scale planting of high-yield root crops, and indeed, many root crops have been planted in rural areas. However, based on our situation, there is a problem that needs to be solved as soon as possible: Take sweet potatoes (yams) for example. The yield per mu is several thousand or even tens of thousands of jin. When it comes to harvest time, in the past, people used narrow hoes to dig them out, which was slow and labor-intensive. At that time, there were many other tasks to be done in rural areas, and there was a large contradiction of not enough labor. We have considered using plows for deep plowing, but the depth of ordinary plows is limited (more than two cun), while sweet potatoes are four or five cun underground. More importantly, the plowshare will puncture the skin of the sweet potatoes or cut them in half, making them difficult to store. We can't think of any other good solutions for the time being. Therefore, we would like to ask the relevant units that study agricultural machinery to consider developing a high-efficiency tool for harvesting sweet potatoes that uses animal power or human power. This is the common hope of the masses here.

    我们需要收获薯类的好农具
    今年我们提倡大量种植薯类高产作物，农村的薯类也确实种的不少。但是根据我们的情况，有一个问题需要及早解决：拿红薯（甘薯）来说吧，亩产几千上万斤，到了收获的时候，过去都是用人力使很窄的镢子刨，效率慢、费工，而那时农村又还有好多其他工作要做，劳力不够，矛盾很大。我们曾考虑用犁深翻，但是普通犁耕的深度有限（二寸多），而红薯则在地下四五寸深处，更重要的是犁的铧子会把红薯戳破皮或者切成两半，不好贮存。我们一时也想不出其他好的办法，因此，想请研究农业机械的有关单位考虑试制一种使用畜力或人力的功效高的收获红薯的农具。这是这里群众普遍的希望。
