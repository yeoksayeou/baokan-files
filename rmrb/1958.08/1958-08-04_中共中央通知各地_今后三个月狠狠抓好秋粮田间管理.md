Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The CCP Central Committee's notice regarding grasping autumn grain field management: Vigorously focusing on autumn grain field management in the next three months, August, September, and October, is of great importance for ensuring a larger autumn harvest. The Central and Southern, and Northwestern regions' agricultural collaboration conferences have already put forward the slogan: During these three months, cadres at the six levels of province, prefecture, county, district, township, and commune will converge and delve into the fields together with the peasants, to manage experimental plots, high-yield fields, and lead the peasants in doing a good job of autumn field management. They will not leave the fields until a comprehensive bumper harvest is achieved. The Central Committee believes that this is a very important measure and hopes that all rural work cadres in all provinces, regions, and cities, as well as some financial, grain, and trade cadres, political and legal cadres, and some cultural and educational cadres, will follow this regulation as much as possible and delve into the fields (which can take the form of a ten-thousand-person inspection and evaluation team), make every effort to cooperate with the peasants, promptly discover problems, solve problems, ensure the realization of a comprehensive bumper harvest this year, and make necessary preparations for a greater leap forward next year.

    中共中央通知各地
    今后三个月狠狠抓好秋粮田间管理
    新华社3日讯　中共中央关于抓好秋粮田间管理的通知。全文如下：在8、9、10三个月内狠狠地抓好秋粮的田间管理，对于保证秋季更大丰收，关系甚大。中南、西北等地区农业协作会议已经提出口号：在这三个月内省、地、县、区、乡、社六级干部会师一律深入田间，和农民一起，搞好试验田、丰产田、带动农民搞好秋田管理工作，不实现全面大丰收决不离开田间。中央认为这是一项很重要的措施，希望各省、区、市的一切农村工作干部，部分财粮贸干部、政法干部、部分文教干部，尽可能地都仿照这个规定，一律深入田间（可以采取万人检查评比团的形式），尽一切努力，协同农民，及时发现问题，解决问题，保证实现今年全面大丰收，并为明年的更大跃进做好必要的准备工作。
