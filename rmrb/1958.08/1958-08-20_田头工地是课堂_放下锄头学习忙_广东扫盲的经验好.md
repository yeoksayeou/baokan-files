Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 19th: Combining literacy campaigns with production during the busy farming season has become a successful experience in many parts of Guangdong Province for accelerating the elimination of illiteracy.

Guangdong began vigorously carrying out the literacy campaign after April and May. During this period, the upsurge of rural production came wave after wave, and the emergence of illiteracy-free counties and cities also surged one after another. By the beginning of August, out of the province's one hundred and twenty counties and cities, thirty had basically or completely eliminated illiteracy. A very important factor in these counties and cities being able to achieve literacy eradication in a short period of time is that they were able to break with right-leaning conservative thinking, propose the slogan of persisting in literacy eradication during the busy farming season; and adopt measures in terms of organizational leadership, universally implementing the method of "township and commune leadership, team-run schools, and group guarantees," with the Communist Party branch secretary or commune director serving as the principal of the people's school, and the production team leader serving as the homeroom teacher, to uniformly lead, arrange, inspect, and evaluate production and literacy work. In this way, a literacy campaign upsurge of "ten thousand people teaching, the whole people learning" was quickly launched during the production upsurge.

Closely integrating study time and study forms with production, and adapting to the requirements of production and the masses, is an important measure by which many counties have been able to accelerate literacy eradication during the busy farming season. When Puning County began vigorously eradicating illiteracy, it implemented "wherever production goes, learning goes there," "textbooks are carried with you, everywhere is a classroom, learn whenever there is time," achieving "fields and construction sites are classrooms, put down your hoes and study hard," with all walls and tools written with characters, so that illiterate people can learn culture anytime and anywhere, and adopted teaching forms such as literacy groups, guaranteed teaching and learning, and delivering characters to the door, so that those who can concentrate study in groups, and those who cannot concentrate study separately. After only forty-five days of hard work, it became the first basically illiteracy-free county in Guangdong Province.

Many counties also pay attention to combining teaching content with production, compiling teaching materials according to the principle of "teach what you do, learn what you produce," and some places also propose "teachers take materials locally, and students learn locally."

　　田头工地是课堂  放下锄头学习忙
　　广东扫盲的经验好
    据新华社广州19日电  在农忙中结合生产开展扫盲运动，已经成为广东省许多地方加速扫除文盲的成功经验。
    广东各地是4、5月以后才大力开展扫盲运动的。这期间，农村生产高潮像波浪一个接着一个，无盲县、市也像波浪一个接着一个涌现。到8月初旬，全省一百二十个县、市中，已有三十个县、市基本或全部扫除文盲。这些县、市能够在短时间内实现扫盲，一个很重要的因素就是能够打破右倾保守思想，提出在农忙中坚持扫盲的口号；并在组织领导方面采取了措施，普遍实行“乡、社领导，队办学，组保证”的办法，由中共党支部书记或社主任当民校校长，生产队长当班主任，对生产、扫盲工作统一领导、安排，统一检查、评比。这样，在生产高潮中很快就掀起了“万人教、全民学”的扫盲高潮。
    把学习时间、学习形式紧密地结合生产，适应生产和群众的要求，是许多县在农忙中能够加速扫盲的一条重要措施。普宁县开始大力扫盲时，就实行“生产到那里就学习到那里”，“课本随身带，到处是课堂，有空便学习”，做到“田头工地是课堂，放下锄头学习忙”，所有墙壁、工具都写上字，让文盲随时随地可以学习文化，并采取了识字小组，包教保学，送字上门等教学形式，让能够集中的就集中学习，不能集中的就分散学习。仅仅经过四十五天的苦战，成为广东省第一个基本无盲县。
    许多县在教学内容上也注意与生产结合，根据“做什么教什么，生产什么学什么”的原则编写教材，有的地方还提出“教师就地取材，学生就地学习”。
