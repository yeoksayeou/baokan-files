Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, August 17th: The 17th Congress of the Uruguayan Communist Party opened here on the evening of August 15th, according to a TASS report from Montevideo. The congress will discuss the following issues: a summary report of the work of the National Committee; the party's election campaign; the struggle for the organizational strengthening and unity of the working class; the report of the Supervisory Committee; a report on the draft program declaration and the political program for recent actions; amendment of the Party Constitution; and the election of the Party's leadership.

After the opening ceremony of the congress, Party Secretary Pastarino read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which said: The Uruguayan Communist Party persistently and consistently defends the democratic rights of the Uruguayan people and safeguards the peace and independence of its motherland. The Uruguayan Communist Party, following the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, has demonstrated unwavering spirit in upholding the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, opposing modern revisionism, and striving to strengthen its own ranks and the entire international communist movement.

The First Secretary of the Party, Arismendi, delivered a work report of the National Committee.

Arismendi said that the characteristics of our era are: the transition from capitalism to socialism; the victorious advance of the world socialist system headed by the Soviet Union; and the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The report resolutely criticized the revisionist views of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and emphasized that the Uruguayan Communist Party is unswervingly loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism.

Arismendi pointed out the profound changes taking place in Latin America: the national liberation struggle has been strengthened. He emphasized that Uruguay is facing two opposing paths, one chosen by imperialism and reactionaries, which is the path of war, crisis, and deepening suffering of the masses; the other path is: implementing an independent foreign policy of peace and friendship with the people of all countries, safeguarding national independence, and developing the country economically and socially, so that the demands of the masses, who are constantly struggling under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the working class and other patriotic strata, can be met. The rapporteur pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the struggle for peace and against U.S. imperialism, to strengthen the unity of the working class, especially the unity of trade unions and the unity of the Uruguayan Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and to strengthen mass work in rural areas.

　　加强反对美国帝国主义的斗争
　　乌拉圭共产党代表大会开幕
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚17日讯：乌拉圭共产党第十七次代表大会15日晚间在这里开幕。大会将讨论下列问题：全国委员会工作总结报告；党的竞选运动；为工人阶级组织上的加强和团结而斗争；监察委员会的报告；关于纲领宣言的草案和最近时期行动的政纲的报告；修改党章；选举党的领导机构。
    在大会举行开幕式后，党的书记帕斯塔里诺宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会的贺电，贺电说：乌拉圭共产党坚持不懈地、始终一贯地保卫着乌拉圭人民的民主权利，维护自己祖国的和平和独立。乌拉圭共产党遵循着马克思列宁主义学说，在维护马克思列宁主义的伟大原则，反对现代修正主义，在争取加强自己队伍和整个国际共产主义运动的斗争中，表现出坚定不移的精神。
    党第一书记阿里斯门迪做了全国委员会工作报告。
    阿里斯门迪说，我们时代的特点是：从资本主义向社会主义过渡；以苏联为首的世界社会主义体系胜利前进以及马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    报告中坚决抨击了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义观点，并且着重指出乌拉圭共产党毫不动摇地忠诚于无产阶级国际主义原则。
    阿里斯门迪指出了拉丁美洲发生的深刻变化：民族解放斗争加强了。他强调说，乌拉圭面临着两条相背的道路，一条是帝国主义和反动派选定的道路，那就是战争、危机和群众的苦难加深的道路；另一条道路是：执行和平以及同世界各国人民友好的独立外交政策，保卫民族独立和使国家在经济和社会方面得到发展，使在共产党领导下工人阶级和其他爱国阶层不断为之斗争的群众的要求得到满足。报告人指出，必须加强争取和平和反对美国帝国主义的斗争，必须加强工人阶级的团结，特别是工会的团结以及乌拉圭共产党和社会党的团结，必须加强农村中的群众工作。
