Prime Minister Sihanouk's Speech Upon Leaving Guangzhou

The words we have to say upon leaving China are very brief. I will simply tell you that at this moment, the scenes of my visit to China reappear before my eyes. It is with deep emotion that I look back on the wonderful and exciting days spent with you. The warm hospitality of the Chinese government and the Chinese people will be recorded in our history.

A new era that germinated in Bandung has begun. As I recently said, you have enabled your country to achieve what some considered impossible, setting an example for the people of Asia and Africa. Last night, Marshal Chen Yi forcefully and clearly elaborated on this idea. The future of the people will be determined by themselves, and no foreign influence can stop their desire for progress and development. As for China, our great friend, the will and work of its people and government have enabled it to leap forward and keep pace with the most advanced countries in the modern world.

Therefore, our visit to China has brought us renewed hope and courage in mastering our own destiny. Our people have potential strength, from which we will draw motivation and courage, which will enable us to follow China's example and build Cambodia into a happy and prosperous country.

I should once again pay tribute to Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Chen Yi, who are sincere friends of our country, whose spirit of understanding and broad vision show that they are invaluable statesmen. The Chinese people have reason to be proud of their leaders and statesmen. Because of their wisdom, patriotism, courage, and self-sacrifice, they have transformed their motherland into a prosperous, respected, and admired power in just a few years.

Dearest friends, I am not saying goodbye to you, but saying see you again soon.

Long live the eternal friendship between Cambodia and China!
Long live the Chinese people!
Long live friendship and peace among the people of all countries!

　　在离开广州时
    西哈努克首相的讲话
    我们要离开中国时所要讲的话是很简短的。我很简单地告诉你们，此刻，我在中国访问的情景又出现在我的眼前。我是以深刻的激动心情回顾和你们在一起度过的美好和令人兴奋的日子的。中国政府和中国人民的盛情款待将记载在我们的历史中。
    在万隆时萌芽的新的时代已经开始了。正如我最近所讲的，你们使得你们的国家实现了某些人认为是不可能的事情，为亚洲和非洲人民树立了榜样。昨晚，陈毅元帅有力地和清晰地将这种思想加以发挥。人民的前途将由他们自己决定，任何外国影响都将无法阻挡他们要求进步和发展的意志。至于中国，我们的伟大朋友，它的人民和政府的意志和工作，已经使它一跃而和现代世界最先进的国家并驾齐驱。
    因此，我们在中国的访问给我们在掌握我们的命运方面重新带来了希望和勇气。我国人民有着潜在的力量，我们将从中汲取动力和勇气，这将使我们得以效法中国的榜样，把柬埔寨建设成一个幸福和繁荣的国家。
    我应该再一次向周恩来总理和陈毅元帅表示敬意，他们是我国的真诚的朋友，他们的谅解精神和远大的目光显示出他们是难能可贵的政治家。中国人民有理由为他们的元首和政治家而自豪。由于他们的智慧、爱国精神、勇敢和自我牺牲精神，他们在短短几年就把他们的祖国变成一个繁荣的、受人尊敬和钦佩的强国。
    最亲爱的朋友们，我不是向你们告别，而是向你们说不久再见。
    柬埔寨和中国之间的永恒友谊万岁！
    中国人民万岁！
    各国人民之间的友谊和和平万岁！
