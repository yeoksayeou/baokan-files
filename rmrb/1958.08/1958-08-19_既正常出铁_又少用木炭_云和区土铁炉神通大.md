According to a report in the Zhejiang Daily: How to achieve normal iron production with indigenous iron smelting methods while reducing charcoal consumption? Yunhe District, Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, with its century of iron smelting experience, has set an example in this regard. While maintaining normal iron production, the ratio of iron sand to charcoal in their hand-operated furnaces can be reduced to 1:1.5, which translates to an iron-to-charcoal ratio of 1:3.

The indigenous furnaces used by the masses in Yunhe District are quite simple. It only takes twenty workdays to build a hand-operated furnace that produces 670 catties per day. Its air blowing equipment is a hand-pulled bellows, which can be manufactured by general handicraft cooperatives in towns and cities. The refractory stone, charcoal ash, yellow clay, and wood for making the bellows are all locally sourced, and the cost is not high. A set of iron smelting equipment costs approximately 200 yuan.

Yunhe District's iron smelting equipment is simple and consumes less charcoal. What is its main experience? According to members of the Yunhe Town Agricultural Cooperative: A crucial key is to control the air intake. The air intake should be as stable as possible, not tight and loose at times, and even more so should not have any interruptions. Whether the wind force is normal can be judged by observing the conditions of the tuyere and the flames on the top of the furnace. If the tuyere, flames, and smoke are all white, it indicates that the situation is normal. At this time, the amount of charcoal can be gradually reduced, and the amount of iron sand can be increased. Generally speaking, the amount of iron sand can be gradually increased from the initial 3 to 4 catties in the first batch to 8 to 10 catties in subsequent batches, and it is not advisable to increase it further. The amount of charcoal can be gradually reduced from the initial 18 to 20 catties in the first batch to 14 to 16 catties in subsequent batches, and it is not advisable to reduce it further.

In Yunhe, Chishi, Meiyuan, and other places, in addition to the widespread use of hand-operated furnaces, water-powered furnaces are also quite common. The charcoal consumption of water-powered furnaces is even lower than that of hand-operated furnaces. Water-powered furnaces are driven by water power, and the principle is the same as that of a general water-powered mortar. Because the power of water is great, each furnace can be equipped with two large bellows, providing sufficient airflow and making it easier to reduce the charcoal ratio. Because these furnaces are more expensive to build, they are generally uniformly equipped by professional iron smelting cooperatives or townships.

The Lishui County Party Committee recently held an on-site meeting in Yunhe to promote the experiences here.

### 既正常出铁　又少用木炭　云和区土铁炉神通大

　　既正常出铁　又少用木炭
　　云和区土铁炉神通大
    据浙江日报报道　土法炼铁怎样做到既能出铁正常，又少耗用木炭，有百年炼铁经验的浙江省丽水县云和区在这方面作出了榜样。他们在出铁正常的情况下，手拉炉的铁砂和木炭的比例可以缩至一比一点五，折成铁、炭比例是一比三。
    云和区群众使用的土炉相当简陋，日产六百七十斤的手拉炉，做好一只炉子只要花二十工。它的鼓风设备是一只手拉风箱，一般城镇的手工业合作社都会制造。这些耐火石、炭灰、黄粘土以及制造风箱的木料，都可就地取材，造价也不贵，一套炼铁设备约计二百元。
    云和区炼铁设备简单，炭耗少，它的主要经验在哪里？据云和镇农业社的社员谈：一个重要关键是掌握进风量。进风要力求稳定，不宜时紧时松，更不能有一些间断。判断风力是否正常可视风口及炉顶火焰情况，风口、火焰、烟都呈白色，就表示情况正常。这时候，就可以逐渐减少木炭，增加铁砂，一般说来，铁砂可以由开炉第一批的三至四斤，逐批增加到八至十斤，至此不宜再增；木炭可以由第一批的十八至二十斤逐批减至十四至十六斤，至此不宜再减。
    在云和、赤石、梅源等地，除普遍使用手拉炉外，水力炉也相当普遍。水力炉的炭耗比手拉炉还要低。水力炉是用水力带动的，原理与一般水碓一样。因为水的力量大，每只炉子可以配上二只大风箱，风量足，炭比更易降低。由于这种炉子造价较高，一般都是由专业炼铁社或乡统一置备的。
    丽水县委最近在云和召开了现场会议，推广了这里的经验。
