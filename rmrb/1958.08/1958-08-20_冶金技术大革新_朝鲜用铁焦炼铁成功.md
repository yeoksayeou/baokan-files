Metallurgical Technology Great Innovation
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th -- The Hwanghae Iron Works in North Korea has recently succeeded in using iron coke to smelt iron, and has already applied this new metallurgical technology in production. It is said that currently, only a few countries with developed ironmaking technology in the world are conducting research on iron coke smelting. North Korea's formal production of pig iron using iron coke is an innovation. Kim Il, Vice Premier of the North Korean Cabinet, pointed out that this is not only a major innovation in North Korea's metallurgical industry, but also a contribution to the development of world metallurgical technology.
    Iron coke is made by mixing coal with a certain proportion of iron ore powder. Replacing ordinary coking coal with iron coke for iron smelting can increase the output of pig iron in blast furnaces and reduce coal consumption. However, adopting this technology requires solving a series of complex technical problems.
    With the close cooperation of technicians and workers, the Hwanghae Iron Works smelted iron coke mixed with 10% iron ore powder on July 13th, and smelted pig iron for the first time with iron coke on July 23rd. In the first ten days of using iron coke to smelt iron, the average daily output of the plant's No. 1 blast furnace increased by forty-two tons. From August 4th, they began to use iron coke mixed with 20% iron ore powder to smelt iron, and the daily output increased by about one hundred tons compared to before using iron coke. The results of using iron coke mixed with 10% iron ore powder in this blast furnace for the first ten days showed that coal consumption was saved by 12%-15% compared to using ordinary coking coal. They also plan to start using iron coke mixed with 30% iron ore in September.

　　冶金技术大革新
　　朝鲜用铁焦炼铁成功
    新华社平壤19日电  朝鲜黄海制铁所最近用铁焦炼铁获得成功，并且已经在生产中运用这一新的冶金技术。据说，目前，在世界上只有少数炼铁技术发达的国家在进行铁焦炼铁的研究工作。用铁焦正式生产生铁，朝鲜是创举。朝鲜内阁副首相金一指出，这不仅是朝鲜冶金工业的一大革新，而且对世界冶金技术的发展作出了贡献。
    铁焦是用煤料混合一定比例的铁矿粉炼成的。用铁焦代替普通焦煤炼铁，可以使高炉生铁产量增加，用煤量降低。但是采用这一技术必须解决一系列复杂的技术问题。
    黄海制铁所在技术人员和工人的通力合作下，7月13日炼出了混合10％铁矿粉的铁焦，在7月23日第一次用铁焦炼出了生铁。这个厂的第一号高炉在用铁焦炼铁的头十天中，平均日产量增加了四十二吨。从8月4日又开始用混合20％铁矿粉的铁焦炼铁，日产量比用铁焦炼铁以前大约增加了一百吨。这座高炉头十天用混合10％铁矿粉的铁焦炼铁的结果，比用普通焦煤炼铁用煤量节省了12％—15％。他们还准备在9月份开始用混合30％铁矿的铁焦炼铁。
