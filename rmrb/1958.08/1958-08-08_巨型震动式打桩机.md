    Giant Vibratory Pile Driver
    The Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced a giant vibratory pile driver. This modern and advanced pile driving machine, although weighing only 11,300 kilograms, has a vibration force of 160,000 kilograms, and can drive huge reinforced concrete pipe piles with a diameter of five meters into various types of soil. During the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, this vibratory machine was used to drive some huge pipe piles into the riverbed.
    This pile driver has a wide range of uses in the construction of large-scale industrial and civil buildings, as well as coal mine shafts. For example, when excavating shafts in sandy soil, it can speed up the construction by six to eight times compared to the commonly used freezing method, and reduce the cost of shaft construction by more than 80%.

    巨型震动式打桩机
    蔡家岗矿山机械厂试制巨型震动式打桩机成功。这种现代先进的打桩机械，虽然自重不过一万一千三百公斤，但是它的震动力有十六万公斤，能将直径五公尺的巨大钢筋混凝土管柱，打入各种类型的土壤中去。长江大桥建设过程中，就是用这种震动机把一些尺寸巨大的管柱打入河床的。
    这种打桩机在大型工业、民用建筑，以及煤矿井筒的建设中，有广泛的用途。例如在砂层中开凿井筒时，比通常采用的冻结法施工的速度加快六至八倍，建井成本可降低80％多。
