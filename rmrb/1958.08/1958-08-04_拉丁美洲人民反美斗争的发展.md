The Flames of Anger Are Burning

The Latin American people's anti-American struggle is rising daily. Lucy, a reporter for the American "New York World-Telegram and Sun," described the current situation of the United States in Latin America, saying, "Anger is burning in Latin America... Uncle Sam is being attacked everywhere from the Caribbean to Cape Horn."

This American reporter's description corresponds to the actual situation in Latin America today. Let us first look at what the United States has encountered in Latin American countries in the past three or four months. In April and May of this year, U.S. Vice President Nixon visited eight South American countries. The people of these countries launched an unprecedentedly powerful anti-American demonstration wave. Nixon was spat upon and chased everywhere. In mid-June, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Rubottom visited Brazil. Although the Brazilian authorities took all measures to prevent anti-American demonstrations, the Brazilian people still held demonstrations. On June 30, one of the only three remaining military dictatorships in Latin America, the Dominican government (the other two being Cuba and Paraguay), which has been under strict U.S. control for many years, notified the Organization of American States Council, based on a resolution passed by the Dominican Congress, to abolish treaties signed between the Dominican Republic and the United States, including various agreements such as U.S. military "aid" to the Dominican Republic, Dominican provision of facilities for U.S. missile testing, "cooperation" in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and U.S. provision of technical "assistance." In July, U.S. President Eisenhower's brother, Milton Eisenhower, visited six Central American countries. Despite the careful precautions taken by these countries, he still encountered anti-American demonstrations by university students and youth in Panama and Nicaragua. In early July, Cuban rebel forces, in protest against the United States supplying weapons to the Batista dictatorship and allowing Batista government forces to use the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo, captured forty-seven Americans active in the rebel-held areas. They were released only after U.S. diplomatic personnel in Cuba went to the rebel headquarters to negotiate. After that, the United States planned to send troops to Cuba under the pretext of defending its pumping station and water pipes at the naval base. This U.S. government measure to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs by armed force aroused protests from the Cuban public. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles postponed his visit to Brazil from July to August. Brazilian workers have decided to hold a twenty-four-hour general strike and large-scale demonstrations on the day Dulles arrives. Recently, the Latin American people have angrily protested against the armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan by the United States and Britain, and mass rallies and demonstrations have been held in many cities. At the end of July, the Haitian people held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy to protest against the U.S. plot to stage a coup in Haiti, and filed a formal protest. Haitian President Duvalier, at a press conference on August 1, severely condemned the U.S. coup plot as an act of international banditry.

These events of the recent months irrefutably demonstrate the fact that the contradiction between Latin American countries and U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly acute. This region, regarded by U.S. monopoly capital as its own "backyard," has ignited a raging fire of anti-colonialism.

Breaking Free from U.S. Plunder and Control

U.S. monopoly capital ruthlessly plunders the Latin American people and controls the economic and political life of Latin American countries, causing their economies to suffer serious disasters, political instability, and the people to live in extreme suffering. The Latin American people can no longer tolerate the U.S. plunder of them and resolutely demand to break free from U.S. control. This is the fundamental reason for the increasing upsurge of the Latin American people's anti-American struggle.

An important means by which U.S. monopoly capital plunders Latin American countries is capital export. U.S. private investment in Latin America amounted to $10.4 billion by the end of 1957. U.S. monopoly capital effectively controls the economic lifeline of Latin American countries through ever-increasing massive investments. For example, U.S. monopoly capital controls 60% of Latin America's oil production, 90% of its copper production, as well as Mexico's lead and zinc, Cuba's gold, and most of Brazil's gold, and Cuba's and Brazil's nickel production. The U.S. "United Fruit Company" controls the agriculture of Central American countries. The profits from these investments are staggering. According to American newspapers, which are clearly underestimated, the profits obtained by U.S. monopoly capital from 1946 to 1956 reached $8.382 billion.

U.S. monopoly capital also uses unequal trade policies such as "buying cheap and selling dear," expanding exports, and restricting imports to carry out the most blatant plunder of Latin American countries, causing these countries to suffer great economic losses and causing their trade deficits to increase year by year. Taking Chile as an example, due to the U.S. practice of "buying cheap and selling dear," in 1956 it needed to export three times more copper and seven times more nitrate than in 1950 to import the same amount of goods as in 1950. This unequal trade increased the trade deficit of Latin American countries with the United States from $300 million in 1956 to $900 million in 1957, resulting in an extremely deteriorated financial and economic situation, declining industrial and agricultural production, increased unemployment, rising prices, and further impoverishment of the people.

The United States also uses its economic control over Latin American countries to try its best to hinder the development of these countries' national industries, leaving them stagnant in a backward economic situation of single-product production. For example, U.S. monopoly capital obstructs Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina from establishing their own oil industries, refuses to supply them with oil industry equipment, and threatens these countries to transfer oil exploration rights to U.S. monopoly capital. The situation is different in Venezuela, where U.S. oil companies have seized 66 million hectares of oil exploration concessions, controlling 70% of the country's oil production and extracting $500 million in profits from Venezuela every year.

U.S. monopoly capital also dumps "surplus" agricultural products in the traditional markets of Latin American countries, manipulates international raw material market prices, and restricts these countries from developing trade relations with other countries, especially socialist countries, in an attempt to maintain its monopoly position in the foreign trade of Latin American countries.

With the increasing severity of the U.S. economic crisis, U.S. monopoly capital has strengthened its plunder and control over Latin American countries. On the one hand, they reduce and limit the quantity of imports, lower import prices, and prepare to restore and raise tariffs; on the other hand, they demand "free trade" from Latin American countries and plot to establish a Latin American "common market" in order to eliminate tariff barriers. These measures of U.S. monopoly capital have aroused great anger among the broad strata of people in Latin American countries. The encounters of Nixon, Rubottom, and Milton Eisenhower in Latin America are a reflection of this anger. Many Latin American countries have taken protective counter-measures against the U.S. attempt to shift the economic crisis onto them. The Brazilian government announced in April of this year the abolition of the trade agreement signed with the United States in 1955. The governments of Argentina and Uruguay have recently decided to temporarily suspend imports respectively. Colombia has also reduced imports of industrial products by half, and other countries are also reducing imports. Since the U.S. share in the total imports of Latin American countries accounts for 60% (1956 statistics), the prohibition and reduction of imports by these countries is a counter-attack against the U.S. expansion of exports and restriction of imports.

Latin American countries have been struggling to get rid of the plunder and control of U.S. monopoly capital and strive for economic independence. Many Latin American countries have nationalized important industrial sectors controlled by foreign monopoly capital, mainly U.S. monopoly capital, thereby weakening the power of foreign monopoly capital and enabling national industries to develop to a certain extent. For example, five countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia, have initially established complete steel industries and have all put them into production. Peru's steel industry is starting to operate, and Venezuela's is being established. Argentina and Brazil already have their own automobile industries. Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia are trying to develop their own oil industries. Brazil and Bolivia have signed an oil agreement, paving the way for the construction of the first oil pipeline across the South American continent. Chile is building a huge pulp and paper industry.

Most Latin American countries oppose the Latin American "common market" plotted by the United States. Since Frondizi took office as President of Argentina, he has strongly advocated economic cooperation among Latin American countries. Argentina and Brazil have reached an agreement on the issue of economic unification between the two countries and intend to form a new Latin American economic group including Chile, Bolivia, and Venezuela with Argentina and Brazil as the core, in order to get rid of U.S. control.

In addition, in order to get rid of the United States' brutal monopoly in foreign trade, Latin American countries are striving to expand trade relations with socialist countries and restore their traditional markets. Currently, fourteen Latin American countries maintain trade relations with socialist countries in different ways.

Puppet Dictatorial Regimes are Collapsing One After Another

Another important aspect of the Latin American people's anti-American struggle is to actively carry out the struggle to overthrow their own dictatorial regimes. These dictatorial regimes are all tools for U.S. imperialism to control Latin American countries. They implement reactionary dictatorial rule internally, deprive the people of freedom, and persecute patriotic and democratic forces; externally, they rely on the United States and serve the interests of U.S. monopoly capital. In the past three years, dictatorial regimes in eight Latin American countries have collapsed one after another.

In September 1955, the Argentine military launched a coup and overthrew the Perón dictatorial regime. Perón was elected president twice, starting in 1946. After coming to power, he concentrated administrative, legislative, and judicial powers in himself and implemented a cruel dictatorial rule over the people. After 1953, he even hoped to rely on the United States to solve Argentina's economic difficulties, which aroused opposition from the people. After the collapse of the Perón regime, Argentina experienced a period of rule by military groups that launched coups. In February of this year, presidential elections were held. The presidential candidate of the "Intransigent Radical Civic Union," Frondizi, was elected. Frondizi's campaign platform put forward some propositions that conformed to national interests and expanded domestic democracy, and was therefore supported by the Communist Party and patriotic democratic forces. After being elected, he took a series of measures to meet the people's democratic demands and won the support of the broad masses of the people.

In March 1956, Lemus was elected President of El Salvador. The dictatorial rule of Osorio, who came to power in 1948 in a coup orchestrated by the United States, was thus declared over.

In February 1956, a military coup occurred in Peru against the dictatorial tyrant Odría. Although it was unsuccessful, it shook the dictator's position. In June 1956, presidential elections were held. The presidential candidate supported by Odría, Lavalle, suffered a crushing defeat. Prado was elected president, and the Peruvian dictatorial regime collapsed.

In September 1956, Nicaraguan dictator Somoza was assassinated and died. His son, Luis Somoza, served as acting president. In February 1957, Luis Somoza won the presidential election and took office in May.

In December 1956, the Haitian people defeated the coup plot of the outgoing dictatorial president Magloire; in February 1957, they overthrew the interim president Pierre-Louis, who openly wanted to restore the old dictator. They elected lawyer and constitutional expert Sylvio Cator as interim president. In September of the same year, Duvalier was elected president.

In May 1957, Colombian dictator Rojas Pinilla was forced to resign under the pressure of people's movements such as strikes, school strikes, and demonstrations. In May 1958, presidential elections were held, and Camargo was elected.

In July 1957, the dictatorial tyrant Armas, who, under the instigation of the United States, used force to overthrow the democratic government of Arbenz in Guatemala, was assassinated. Armas was a loyal lackey of U.S. imperialism. After coming to power, he immediately suppressed the Labor Party (i.e., the Communist Party), massacred former government officials, banned all democratic parties and progressive organizations such as trade unions, returned the land confiscated by the former government to the U.S. "United Fruit Company," abolished various restrictions on foreign companies, and promulgated many reactionary laws, which aroused strong opposition from the people of all strata in the country.

In January 1958, the Jiménez dictatorial regime, which had ruled Venezuela for ten years, was overthrown, and a military government headed by Larrazábal was established. Presidential elections are scheduled for November of this year. Jiménez has always been loyal to U.S. oil monopoly capital and is known as the "model friend among all U.S. friends in Latin America." The collapse of the Jiménez regime was a great victory for the Venezuelan people.

Now, only three dictatorial regimes loyal to U.S. monopoly capital remain in Latin America: Cuba, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic. But in these three countries, dictatorial rule is also very unstable. The Cuban rebel forces are still continuing their armed struggle to overthrow the Batista dictatorial regime; in southern Paraguay, an armed struggle against the Stroessner dictatorial regime broke out in April of this year, and it has organized a "Citizen Army for Paraguayan Freedom" with more than 1,000 people. The Dominican Republic's abolition of treaties signed with the United States, although caused by some minor disputes, also shows that anti-American sentiment is also growing in this dictatorial government.

Controlling Their Own Destiny

This new political trend in Latin America has aroused great anxiety among U.S. imperialism, and it has recently repeatedly plotted coup conspiracies in a vain attempt to restore pro-American dictatorial regimes in these countries. The conspiracy of Venezuelan Defense Minister Castro León to launch a military coup was actually instigated by U.S. imperialism. But the Venezuelan government, with the support of a powerful demonstration of 100,000 people in the capital and the people, government departments, and parties throughout the country, shattered this reactionary coup conspiracy and expelled the rebels from the country. On July 29, 1958, the United States again instigated former Haitian Army Captain Pasquet to launch a military coup in which Americans directly participated, but it was quickly suppressed by the Haitian government.

This situation shows that although U.S. imperialism is trying to re-enslave the people of these countries, under the situation that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind, as long as the people of all countries unite and persist in the struggle, it is entirely possible to defeat this attempt by U.S. imperialism.

The flames of the Latin American people's opposition to U.S. enslavement have spread, and the colonial policies pursued by the United States in Latin America are becoming increasingly unworkable. The people of Latin American countries are standing up and want to take their destiny into their own hands. The wishes of the awakened people of Latin America will definitely be realized.

    拉丁美洲人民反美斗争的发展
    章叶
    怒火在燃烧
    拉丁美洲人民的反美斗争日益高涨。美国“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”记者露西描述今天美国在拉丁美洲的处境说，“怒火燃烧着拉丁美洲……美国佬从加勒比海到合恩角到处受到攻击。”
    这位美国记者的描述是符合拉丁美洲今天的实况的。让我们先看一看最近三四个月当中美国在拉丁美洲国家的遭遇。今年4—5月间，美国副总统尼克松访问南美八个国家，这些国家的人民掀起了空前强大的反美示威浪潮，尼克松到处遭到唾骂和追打。6月中旬，美国美洲事务助理国务卿鲁波顿到巴西访问，尽管巴西当局采取了一切措施，以防止发生反美示威，但是巴西人民仍然举行了示威。6月30日，拉丁美洲仅存的三个军事独裁政府之一，多年来一直处在美国严格控制下的多米尼加政府（另外两国是古巴和巴拉圭），根据多米尼加国会通过的决议，通知美洲国家组织理事会，废除多米尼加和美国所签订的条约，包括美国给多米尼加军事“援助”、多米尼加为美国试验导弹提供便利条件，和平利用核能方面两国实行“合作”和美国给予技术“援助”等各种协定。7月间，美国总统艾森豪威尔的弟弟密尔顿·艾森豪威尔访问中美六个国家，虽然经过这些国家的周密防范，还是在巴拿马和尼加拉瓜遇到了大学生和青年的反美游行示威。7月初，古巴起义部队为了抗议美国供给巴蒂斯塔独裁政权武器和让巴蒂斯塔政府军使用美国在关塔那摩的海军基地，俘获了在起义部队占领区活动的四十七名美国人，经美国驻古巴外交人员前往起义部队总部谈判后才获释放。在这以后，美国打算借口保卫它在这个海军基地的抽水站和输水管而派军队到古巴去。美国政府的这个武装干涉古巴内政的措施，引起了古巴公众的抗议。美国国务卿杜勒斯把访问巴西的日期从7月推迟到8月，巴西的工人已经决定在杜勒斯到达的那一天举行二十四小时的总罢工和大规模的示威游行。最近期间，拉丁美洲人民愤怒抗议美国和英国武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，许多城市都举行了群众大会和示威游行。7月底，海地人民为抗议美国在海地策划政变的阴谋，在美国大使馆前举行示威，并且提出了一项正式抗议。海地总统杜瓦利埃在8月1日举行的记者招待会上，严厉指责美国的政变阴谋是一种国际土匪行为。
    最近几个月所发生的这些事件，无可辩驳地表明了这一事实：拉丁美洲国家同美帝国主义之间的矛盾日益尖锐化，这个被美国垄断资本视为自己“后院”的地区，已经燃起了反殖民主义的熊熊烈火。
    摆脱美国的掠夺和控制
    美国垄断资本残酷地掠夺拉丁美洲人民，控制拉丁美洲国家的经济生活和政治生活，使它们的经济遭受严重灾难，政治动荡不安，人民生活痛苦万分。拉丁美洲人民再也不能容忍美国对他们的掠夺，坚决要求摆脱美国的控制，这是拉丁美洲人民反美斗争日益高涨的根本原因。
    美国垄断资本掠夺拉丁美洲国家的重要手段是资本输出。美国对拉丁美洲的私人投资，到1957年年底已达一百零四亿美元。美国垄断资本通过不断增加的庞大投资实际上控制了拉丁美洲国家的经济命脉。例如，拉丁美洲60％的石油生产，90％的铜的生产以及墨西哥的铅和锌，古巴的金和巴西大部分的金，古巴和巴西的镍的生产，都控制在美国垄断资本手中。美国“联合果品公司”则控制着中美洲国家的农业。至于这些投资的利润更是惊人。据美国报刊显然缩小了的估计，从1946年到1956年，美国垄断资本所获得的利润达八十三亿八千二百万美元。
    美国垄断资本还利用“贵卖贱买”、扩大出口、限制进口等不平等贸易政策，对拉丁美洲国家进行最露骨的掠夺，使这些国家经济上受到极大损失并使贸易逆差逐年激增。以智利为例，由于美国“贵卖贱买”，1956年要进口同1950年一样多的货物，就需要出口三倍于1950年的铜和七倍于1950年的硝石。这种不平等的贸易，使拉丁美洲国家对美国的贸易逆差从1956年的三亿美元，增加到1957年的九亿美元，从而导致这些国家的财政经济状况极端恶化，工农业生产下降，失业增加，物价上涨，人民生活更加贫困化。
    美国还利用它们对拉丁美洲国家经济上的控制，竭力阻碍这些国家民族工业的发展，使它们停滞在单一生产的落后经济状况。例如，美国垄断资本阻挠墨西哥、巴西和阿根廷建立本国的石油工业，拒绝供给它们石油工业设备，并且要挟这些国家把石油开采权转让给美国垄断资本。在委内瑞拉是另外一种情况，美国石油康采恩攫取了六千六百万公顷的石油开采租让权，控制了这个国家石油生产的70％，每年要从委内瑞拉榨取五亿美元的利润。
    美国垄断资本还在拉丁美洲国家的传统市场上倾销“剩余”农产品，操纵国际原料市场价格，限制这些国家同其他国家，特别是社会主义国家发展贸易关系，企图保持它们对拉丁美洲国家对外贸易的垄断地位。
    随着美国经济危机的日益严重，美国垄断资本加强了对拉丁美洲国家的掠夺和控制。它们一方面减少和限制进口数量，压低进口价格，准备恢复和提高关税；另方面却向拉丁美洲国家要求“自由贸易”，策划建立拉丁美洲“共同市场”，借以消除关税壁垒。美国垄断资本的这些措施，引起了拉丁美洲国家广泛阶层人民的极大愤怒，尼克松、鲁波顿、密尔顿·艾森豪威尔在拉丁美洲的遭遇，就是这种愤怒情绪的反映。许多拉丁美洲国家并对美国企图向它们转嫁经济危机的做法采取了保护性的反击措施。巴西政府在今年4月宣布废除1955年和美国签订的贸易协定，阿根廷和乌拉圭两国政府最近已分别决定暂时停止进口，哥伦比亚也把工业品的进口缩减一半，其他国家也都在缩减进口。由于在拉丁美洲国家进口总额中美国的份额占60％（1956年的统计），这些国家的禁止和缩减进口就是对美国扩大出口和限制进口的一个回击。
    拉丁美洲国家一直为摆脱美国垄断资本的掠夺和控制，争取经济上的独立而进行斗争。许多拉丁美洲国家把掌握在外国垄断资本，主要是美国垄断资本手中的重要工业部门收归国有，从而削弱了外国垄断资本的势力，并使民族工业得到一定程度的发展。例如，阿根廷、巴西、智利、墨西哥和哥伦比亚五个国家已经初步建立起完整的钢铁工业，并且都已投入生产。秘鲁的钢铁工业正在开工，委内瑞拉的正在建立。阿根廷和巴西已经有了自己的汽车工业。阿根廷、巴西、玻利维亚正在设法发展自己的石油工业。巴西和玻利维亚签订了石油协定，为建筑横贯南美大陆第一条输油管铺平了道路。智利正在建立巨大的纸浆造纸工业。
    拉丁美洲大多数国家反对美国阴谋筹划的拉丁美洲“共同市场”。弗朗迪西就任阿根廷总统后，极力主张拉丁美洲国家的经济合作。阿根廷和巴西已经就两国经济统一问题达成协议，并打算以阿根廷和巴西为核心组织包括智利、玻利维亚、委内瑞拉等国的新的拉丁美洲经济集团，以摆脱美国的控制。
    此外，为了摆脱美国在对外贸易上的粗暴垄断，拉丁美洲国家正在争取扩大同社会主义国家的贸易关系和恢复自己的传统市场。现在，有十四个拉丁美洲国家在以不同的方式同社会主义国家保持贸易关系。
    傀儡独裁政权纷纷垮台
    拉丁美洲人民反美斗争的另一个重要方面是，积极进行推翻本国独裁政权的斗争。这些独裁政权都是美帝国主义控制拉丁美洲国家的工具。它们对内实行反动的独裁统治，剥夺人民自由，迫害爱国民主力量；对外投靠美国，为美国垄断资本的利益服务。最近三年来，先后有八个拉丁美洲国家的独裁政权垮台。
    1955年9月，阿根廷军人发动政变，推翻了庇隆独裁政权。庇隆从1946年起两度当选总统。上台后，集行政、立法、司法大权于一身，对人民实行严酷的独裁统治。1953年以后，更指望投靠美国解决阿根廷的经济困难，引起了人民的反对。在庇隆政权垮台后，阿根廷曾经历了一段发动政变的军人集团的统治时期，在今年2月举行了总统选举。“不妥协激进公民联盟”总统候选人弗朗迪西当选。弗朗迪西的竞选纲领提出了一些符合民族利益和扩大国内民主的主张，因而得到共产党和爱国民主力量的支持。当选后又采取一系列满足人民民主要求的措施，得到了广大人民的支持。
    1956年3月，雷穆斯当选萨尔瓦多总统。于1948年在美国策动下发动政变上台的奥索里欧的独裁统治，于是宣告结束。
    1956年2月，秘鲁曾发生反对独裁暴君俄德利亚的军事政变，虽然没有成功，却动摇了这个独裁者的地位。1956年6月举行总统选举，俄德利亚支持的总统候选人拉瓦里惨败，普拉多当选总统，秘鲁独裁政权遂告垮台。
    1956年9月，尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查遇刺身死，由其子路易斯·索摩查代理总统。1957年2月，路易斯·索摩查竞选总统获胜，5月就职。
    1956年12月，海地人民击败了任期已满的马格鲁阿独裁总统的政变阴谋；1957年2月，又推翻了公然为旧独裁者复辟的临时总统皮埃尔—路易士，选举了律师、宪法专家西尔瓦因为临时总统。同年9月，杜瓦利埃当选总统。
    1957年5月，哥伦比亚独裁者罗哈斯·皮尼亚在罢工、罢课、游行示威的人民运动压力下被迫辞职。1958年5月举行总统选举，卡马戈当选。
    1957年7月，在美国策动下用武力推翻危地马拉阿本斯民主政府的独裁暴君阿马斯被刺身死。阿马斯是美帝国主义的忠实走卒，上台后立即镇压劳动党（即共产党），屠杀前政府官员，取缔一切民主政党和工会等进步团体，把前政府没收的土地交还给美国“联合果品公司”，取消对外国公司的各种限制，并颁布许多反动法令，因而引起国内各阶层人民的强烈反对。
    1958年1月，统治委内瑞拉达十年之久的希门尼斯独裁政权被推翻，成立了以拉腊萨巴耳为首的军政府，并定今年11月举行总统选举。希门尼斯一向忠实于美国石油垄断资本，被称为美国“在拉丁美洲所有朋友中的模范朋友”。希门尼斯政权的垮台是委内瑞拉人民的一次巨大胜利。
    现在，拉丁美洲只剩下古巴、巴拉圭和多米尼加三个忠实于美国垄断资本的独裁政权了。而在这三个国家里，独裁统治也非常不稳。古巴的起义部队还在继续进行推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的武装斗争；巴拉圭南部在今年4月间爆发了反对斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的武装斗争，并且组织成拥有一千多人的“争取巴拉圭自由公民军”。多米尼加的废除同美国签订的条约，虽然是由于一些微不足道的争执引起的，但也说明在这个独裁政府里，反美情绪也正在增长。
    掌握自己的命运
    拉丁美洲这种新的政治动向，引起美帝国主义的极大不安，最近接二连三地策划政变阴谋，妄图在这些国家中复辟亲美独裁政权。委内瑞拉国防部长卡斯特罗—莱昂发动军事政变的阴谋，实际上是美帝国主义策动的。但委内瑞拉政府在首都十万人民的强大游行示威以及全国各地人民、政府各部门以及各党派的支持下，粉碎了这次反动政变阴谋，并把叛变分子驱逐出境。1958年7月29日，美国又唆使前海地陆军上尉巴斯基发动有美国人直接参加的军事政变，也被海地政府迅速镇压下去。
    这种情况说明，尽管美帝国主义力图重新奴役这些国家的人民，但是在东风已经压倒西风的形势下，只要各国人民团结起来，坚持斗争，是完全可以击败美帝国主义的这种图谋的。
    拉丁美洲国家人民反对美国奴役的火焰已经延烧起来，美国在拉丁美洲推行的殖民主义政策已越来越行不通了。拉丁美洲各国人民正在站起来，要把自己的命运掌握在自己的手中。觉醒了的拉丁美洲的人民的愿望是一定能够实现的。
