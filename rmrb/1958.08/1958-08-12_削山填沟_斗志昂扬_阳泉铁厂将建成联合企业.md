According to the Shanxi Daily, the Yangquan Iron Plant is being expanded into an iron and steel complex.

The Yangquan Iron Plant is currently a small iron-smelting plant with an annual output of 150,000 tons of iron. According to the province's industrial plan, it will be expanded into a large combined iron and steel enterprise. By 1962, the annual output will reach: 800,000 to 1 million tons of steel, 600,000 to 800,000 tons of steel products, 1 million to 1.5 million tons of iron, and 150,000 to 300,000 tons of refractory materials. This is equivalent to two to three times the current Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Along with the expansion of the main production workshops, auxiliary departments such as machinery repair, power, transportation, and testing will also be greatly expanded. The expansion projects this year include two blast furnaces with an effective volume of 255 cubic meters, a converter-electric furnace combined steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 150,000 to 200,000 tons of steel, a medium-sized rolling steel workshop with an annual output of 130,000 to 150,000 tons of steel, and a refractory material workshop with an annual output of 50,000 to 100,000 tons of refractory materials. Next year, a small seamless steel pipe workshop and larger blast furnaces and electric furnaces will be built. Half of the entire expansion project will be completed in 1960, and the entire expansion project will be completed in 1962. By then, it will be able to produce light rails, seamless steel pipes, medium plates, thin plates, special steel, silicon steel sheets, and various steel products, and will produce various equipment for small iron and steel combined enterprises.

The first step in the expansion project of this plant is to level the Da Shandong Naowan, which is 35 meters high on the east side of the plant, as an expansion base. Now, the people of Yangquan City, from the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee to ordinary citizens, are fighting bravely and arduously here to level mountains and fill gullies at high speed.

　　削山填沟　斗志昂扬
　　阳泉铁厂将建成联合企业
    据山西日报消息　阳泉铁厂正在扩建为一个钢铁联合企业。
    阳泉铁厂现在是一个年产十五万吨铁的小型炼铁厂。根据全省工业的规划，它将被扩建成为一个大型联合钢铁企业。到1962年，年产量将达到：钢八十至一百万吨，钢材六十至八十万吨，铁一百至一百五十万吨，耐火材料十五至三十万吨。这等于目前太原钢铁厂的二至三倍。随着主要生产车间的扩建，机修、动力、运输、化验等附属部门也将大大扩大。今年扩建的工程，有二百五十五立方公尺有效容积的高炉两座、年产十五至二十万吨钢的转炉电炉双联炼钢车间、年产十三至十五万吨钢材的中型轧钢车间、年产五至十万吨耐火材料的耐火材料车间。明年建设小型无缝钢管车间及更大的高炉和电炉。1960年完成全部扩建工程的一半，1962年完成全部扩建工程。到那时，它就可以出产轻便道轨、无缝钢管、中板、薄板、特殊钢、矽钢片以及各种钢材，并将生产小型钢铁联合企业的各种设备。
    这个厂扩建工程的第一步，是把厂东有三十五公尺高的大山东瑙湾削平，作为扩建基地。现在，阳泉市的人民，从市委书记到普通市民，在这儿奋勇苦战，以高速度削山填沟。
