Xinhua News Agency Report: The Soviet Union's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the cessation of US and British aggression in the Middle East has been widely welcomed by world public opinion. Newspapers in many countries have published commentaries supporting the Soviet Union's peaceful efforts and condemning the US and British conspiracies to obstruct and undermine summit conferences. Newspapers in various countries also pointed out that immediately stopping US and British aggression and forcing the US and Britain to withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East is an urgent task for eliminating the Middle East war crisis and maintaining peace.

    United Arab Republic
    Soviet Premier Khrushchev's reply to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France has been warmly welcomed in the United Arab Republic. All newspapers in Cairo published Khrushchev's proposal to immediately convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan under banner headlines.
    "Al-Akhbar" emphasized in its headline that "Moscow firmly advocates the immediate convening of a meeting of representatives of all countries to demand the withdrawal of US and British troops from Middle Eastern countries."
    "Al-Shaab" pointed out while condemning the US position that the United States must bear direct responsibility for undermining the high-level meeting.
    Cairo's "Al-Masaa" published an editorial on the 6th, saying that a United Nations General Assembly meeting with the participation of Asian and African countries would be able to exert pressure to convene a top-level meeting; and the United Nations would have a moral and concrete obligation to make a decision to defend peace and determine its attitude towards the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East.
    Damascus's "Al-Manar" published an editorial on the 6th, welcoming Khrushchev's proposal to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly. The editorial said that holding a special session of the General Assembly to discuss the current situation in the Near and Middle East is more effective.

    Iraq
    All Iraqi newspapers prominently published summaries of Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower on the front page with large headlines, emphasizing that the Soviet government leader demanded the rapid convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly. "Al-Khabar" emphasized: "Khrushchev demanded the immediate convening of a United Nations General Assembly meeting to discuss the withdrawal of British and American troops from Lebanon and Jordan."

    Vietnam
    Hanoi newspapers on the 7th all published Khrushchev's proposal to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US and British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan under large headlines.
    "Nhan Dan" editorial said that this proposal once again proves the Soviet Union's persistent efforts to peacefully resolve the Middle East issue.
    The editorial pointed out that the US and British authorities are trying their best to evade and delay the convening of a summit conference. And discussing the Middle East issue through the Security Council controlled by US and British imperialism and according to the procedures advocated by them will not yield any results.

    East Germany
    Khrushchev's reply to the three Western countries is the focus of attention in Berlin's democratic district newspapers. The newspapers emphasized that in order to continue efforts to maintain and strengthen peace in the Near and Middle East, the Soviet government proposed convening an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.
    "Neues Deutschland" published the full text of Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower and highlighted: Khrushchev hopes to discuss the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan at the United Nations General Assembly.
    "National-Zeitung" believes that the Soviet government's proposal to convene an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly is a measure to ease international tensions.

    Romania
    "Scînteia" wrote: Khrushchev's letter to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France on August 5th once again demonstrated the Soviet Union's determination to end the dangerous situation caused by US and British aggression against Arab countries. The Soviet Union requested the convening of an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly because the vast majority of the members of the Security Council are member states of the aggressive bloc controlled by US imperialism, and the Security Council has been unable to fulfill its responsibilities.

    Bulgaria
    "Rabotnichesko Delo" wrote in an editorial entitled "The Soviet Union Points Out the Road to Maintaining Peace Again": Khrushchev suggested convening an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the withdrawal of the United States and Britain from Lebanon and Jordan. In this way, the Soviet government once again emphasized the important role that the United Nations, especially its highest organ, the United Nations General Assembly, can and should play in maintaining peace and ensuring the security of all nations.
    The newspaper pointed out that the Bulgarian people support the Soviet proposal because they believe it is an effective means of maintaining universal peace.

    Britain
    The "Daily Worker" published a commentary on the 7th saying that Khrushchev's new letter suggesting the convening of an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly has exposed Dulles's activities and "focused the world's attention on the key issue of Middle East peace - the withdrawal of British and American troops from Jordan and Lebanon."
    The "Daily Worker" wrote: "The current Middle East crisis was caused by the interference of these troops. The continued presence of these troops aggravates the crisis. Only the withdrawal of these troops can create the specific conditions for solving the Middle East problem. This is the responsibility that the United Nations General Assembly is now facing, and people all over the world hope that it will take swift and vigorous action."

    联大紧急会议主题应该是要美英撤军
    苏联新建议得到各国舆论广泛的支持
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息：苏联关于要求召开联合国大会紧急会议讨论制止美英侵略中东的建议，受到世界舆论的广泛欢迎。许多国家的报纸都纷纷发表评论，支持苏联的和平努力，谴责美英阻挠和破坏首脑会议的阴谋。各国报纸并指出，立即制止美英侵略活动，迫使美英从中东撤出侵略军队，是消除中东战争危机和维护和平的迫切任务。
    阿联
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给美、英、法三国政府首脑的回信，在阿拉伯联合共和国受到了最热烈的欢迎。开罗所有报纸都用头号大字标题发表了苏联关于立即召开联合国大会紧急会议讨论美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的建议。
    “消息报”在标题中强调指出，“莫斯科坚决主张立即召开世界各国代表会议，以便要求美英军队撤出中近东各国”。
    “人民报”在谴责美国的立场时指出，美国要对破坏高级会议负直接责任。
    开罗“晚报”6日发表社论说，有亚非国家参加的联合国大会会议将能施加压力要求召开最高级会议；而联合国将有道义的和具体的义务作出决定，来保卫和平和确定它对外国军队撤出中东问题的态度。
    大马士革“灯塔报”6日发表社论，欢迎赫鲁晓夫提出的要求召开联合国大会特别会议的建议。社论说，举行联大特别会议来讨论中近东当前局势的问题，是比较有效的。
    伊拉克
    所有伊拉克报纸都在第一版以大字标题摘要刊登了赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信，并且强调指出，苏联政府领导人要求迅速召开联合国大会特别会议。“消息报”强调说：“赫鲁晓夫要求立即召开联合国大会会议来讨论英美军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出的问题”。
    越南
    河内各报7日都以大字标题刊登了赫鲁晓夫关于召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美英侵略军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦问题的建议。
    “人民报”的社论说，这项建议再一次证明苏联坚持不懈地为和平解决中东问题而努力。
    社论指出，美英当局极力回避和拖延首脑会议的召开。而通过由美英帝国主义控制的安全理事会和按它们主张的手续来讨论中东问题，那是得不到什么结果的。
    民主德国
    赫鲁晓夫给西方三国的回信是柏林民主区报纸注意的中心。各报着重说，苏联政府为了继续努力维护和加强中近东的和平，提议召开联合国大会紧急特别会议来讨论美英军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出的问题。
    “新德意志报”刊载了赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信的全文，并且着重标出：赫鲁晓夫希望在联合国大会上讨论美军撤出黎巴嫩和英军撤出约旦的问题。
    “国民日报”认为，苏联政府关于召开联合国大会紧急特别会议的建议是缓和国际紧张局势的措施。
    罗马尼亚
    “火花报”写道：赫鲁晓夫在8月5日给美、英、法政府首脑的信，再一次表明了苏联决心终止美、英侵略阿拉伯国家所造成的危险局势。苏联要求召开联合国大会紧急会议，是因为安全理事会的绝大多数成员都是受美帝国主义控制的侵略集团的成员国，安理会已经不能履行它的职责。
    保加利亚
    “工人事业报”在题为“苏联再次指出了维护和平的道路”的社论中写道：赫鲁晓夫建议召开联合国大会紧急会议，讨论美国和英国从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军的问题。这样，苏联政府再一次强调了联合国、特别是它的最高机关联合国大会所能够而且应该起到的重要作用——维护和平和保障各国人民的安全。
    报纸指出，保加利亚人民支持苏联的建议，因为他们认为这是维护普遍和平的有效手段。
    英国
    “工人日报”7日发表评论说，赫鲁晓夫建议召开联合国大会紧急会议的新信件已经揭露了杜勒斯的活动，并且“使世界的注意力集中于中东和平的关键问题——英军和美军撤出约旦和黎巴嫩的问题”。
    “工人日报”写道：“造成目前中东危机的是这些军队的干涉。使危机更趋严重的是他们的继续留驻，只有撤出这些军队才能创造解决中东问题的具体条件。这是联合国大会现在面临的职责，全世界人民希望它采取迅速有力的行动。”
