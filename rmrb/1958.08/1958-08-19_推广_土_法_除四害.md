　　Promote "Indigenous" Methods for "Eliminating the Four Pests"
　　Shu Shen
    The wisdom and power of the masses are immense and inexhaustible. In the movement to "eliminate the four pests," they have created many "indigenous tools," "indigenous methods," and discovered many "indigenous medicines." These "indigenous tools," "indigenous methods," and "indigenous medicines" are not only simple to make and easy to use, but they can also be done without spending money or with little expense, and can achieve significant results. The stone slab trap, a rat-catching tool widely used in Shuangbai County, Yunnan Province, can be made by skilled people with just a few cuts, and the materials needed are just a few pieces of bamboo. When using it, simply set it up in the evening and check it in the morning, which does not hinder production. Some people can manage more than 200 such traps; they use wild plants such as *Typhonium giganteum* and *Lycoris radiata* as local remedies to kill maggots, and the effect is very good. As long as the masses are mobilized, they can be collected in large quantities. In Hefei City, Anhui Province, after the masses created and used net bags to catch mosquitoes, in March alone, the city caught more than 389,000 matchboxes of mosquitoes, nearly 100 times more than the total number caught in January and February. An Renjin, a model pest controller in Gulan County, Sichuan Province, created 19 kinds of rat and sparrow catching tools such as "automatic rat traps" and "mandarin duck traps." After promotion, more than 2,000 rats and sparrows were eliminated in just over a month. From this, it seems that summarizing and promoting the "indigenous tools," "indigenous methods," and "indigenous medicines" created by the masses in the practice of eliminating the four pests, and organizing the exchange of experiences, is of very important significance to carrying out the movement.
    However, some places do not pay enough attention to the indigenous methods and practical experience of the masses, and only rely on a few medical personnel to guide the mass movement; they believe in using drugs such as zinc phosphide and antu to poison rats, and using drugs such as 666 and 223 to kill mosquitoes and flies, so that the effect is not very significant.
    Eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene is a large-scale mass movement. Since it is a mass movement, we must rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, fully promote the wisdom of the masses, and vigorously promote the "indigenous medicines," "indigenous tools," and "indigenous methods" invented and discovered by the masses in order to meet the requirements of eliminating the four pests.

　　推广“土”法“除四害”
　　书绅
    群众的智慧和力量是巨大的、无穷无尽的，他们在“除四害”运动中创造了很多“土工具”、“土办法”，发现了很多“土药物”。这些“土工具”、“土办法”、“土药物”不但制作简便、使用方便，不花钱或少花钱就可以办到，并能收到显著效果。云南省双柏县大量推广使用的捕鼠工具——石板机，制作起来熟练的人只要几刀就能劈成一件，需用的材料也只是几片竹子，使用时只要晚上支放早起检查，也不妨碍生产，有的群众一个人就能掌握二百余件工具；他们使用野生植物虎掌草、石蒜等土药灭蛆，效果很好，只要发动群众，就可以大量采集到。安徽省合肥市群众创造使用网兜捕蚊后，仅今年3月份，全市就捕蚊三十八万九千多火柴盒，超过1、2月份捕蚊总和近一百倍。四川省古兰县除八害能手安仁金创造“自动灭鼠箱”、“鸳鸯套”等十九种捕鼠雀工具，推广后一个多月就消灭鼠雀二千多只。由此看来，总结和推广群众在除四害实践中创造的“土工具”、“土办法”、“土药物”，组织经验交流，对开展运动是有非常重要作用的。
    但是，有些地方对群众的土办法和实践经验重视不够，只是依靠少数医务人员去指导群众运动；相信使用磷化锌、安妥等药物毒鼠，和用六六六、二二三等药物灭蚊蝇，以致效果并不十分显著。
    除四害、讲卫生是一个大规模的群众运动，既是群众运动，就要依靠群众，发动群众，充分发扬群众的智慧，大力推广群众所发明和发现的“土药物”、
  “土工具”、“土办法”，才能达到除四害的要求。
