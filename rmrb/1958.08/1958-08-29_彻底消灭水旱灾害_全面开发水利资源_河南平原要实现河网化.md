Thoroughly Eliminate Floods and Droughts, Comprehensively Develop Water Resources
Henan Plain to Achieve River Network

(Reported by our newspaper) The Henan Daily published an editorial entitled "New Measures for Water Conservancy Construction," stating: Recently, the Shangqiu Special Zone and the Suiping County of Xinyang Special Zone have successively put forward preliminary plans for realizing river networks; the Xinxiang Special Zone has decided to vigorously develop water storage projects, requiring the mobilization of 800,000 laborers to realize reservoir-pond and river network construction before and after the autumn harvest. People in Changyuan and other counties have already begun to take action. This is a new measure under the new situation. It provides us with the correct direction for fundamentally changing the natural landscape, eradicating floods and droughts, and comprehensively developing water resources in the plains.

The editorial said: The struggle of the plains to realize river networks is a new measure as our province's water conservancy construction enters a new stage. With the realization of river networks, it will not be disastrous with 200 or 300 millimeters of rainfall, but it will not be disastrous with 500 or even 1,000 millimeters of rainfall; it will not be a bumper harvest without rain for a hundred days, but a bumper harvest without rain for a year. In water conservancy construction, the method of fully developing water resources is to store the water from the sky, extract the groundwater, and utilize the river water. Realizing river networks can completely solve this problem. River networks can not only fully store water, storing all the runoff in the plains for use at any time, but also discharge water in the event of extremely heavy rainfall. In the past, the main reason for waterlogging disasters was the internal and external water supporting each other, with the external water being higher and the internal water unable to flow out. With the realization of river networks, with ditches connecting to each other and rivers connecting to each other, even the largest amount of rainfall can be handled calmly when it exceeds the water storage capacity. The newly opened rivers are all dug to two to three meters below the groundwater level, and combined with well mechanization, groundwater can be fully developed, providing sufficient water for irrigation in any drought situation. Because the rivers are connected to each other, river water can also be rationally utilized. Therefore, the river network is a complete method for comprehensively utilizing "three waters" and a fundamental measure for eradicating floods and droughts in the plains.

The new stage of water conservancy construction means that water conservancy construction not only serves agriculture, but also allows water to serve industry, transportation, power generation, and other aspects. Water is the country's infinite wealth, and every drop of water that falls on the ground should not only be used once, but many times, and in many ways. Digging river channels and building dams is not only conducive to water storage and solving water for industrial and agricultural production, but also can use the water level difference to build power stations. The realization of river networks, with rivers connecting to each other, can also effectively solve the urgently needed transportation problems in the current great leap forward in industry and agriculture. River networks will enable every township and commune to have access to wooden boats, and every county to have access to ships, greatly reducing the labor force for rural transportation. Therefore, the realization of river networks provides extremely favorable conditions for solving transportation and electricity problems for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. It can serve the three major "marshals" of steel, grain, and machinery and electronics very well.

According to Henan Daily, in order to completely eliminate floods and droughts and strive to achieve a per-mu yield of double thousand catties of grain in the special zone next year, the Shangqiu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Henan recently held a series of meetings to systematically study water conservancy construction, and determined the preliminary plan for the river network of the entire special zone—to realize irrigation self-sufficiency, dry-land rice cultivation, hydroelectric electrification, water conservancy mechanization, reservoir fish farming, and waterway transportation as soon as possible.

The meeting determined the outline of the river network plan: diverting the Yellow River water southward, diverting the Sha River water northward, developing surface and underground water together, mutual assistance between east, west, north, and south, digging 3,000 li of canals, connecting seven major rivers vertically and horizontally, constructing 50 key projects (five projects in each), building large-scale reservoirs, and realizing river networks in conjunction with medium-sized projects to lay the foundation for the "sixizations." The method is to comprehensively develop large, medium, and small rivers, ditches, and main, branch, and fighting canals, manage them in stages, and utilize them comprehensively. The rivers, ditches, and canals will be deepened and widened, interwoven vertically and horizontally, connecting various ponds and reservoirs, and key projects and various control projects will be built section by section on the ditches and river channels to form an interconnected organic whole. Through it, it can not only store water to prevent drought and flood, but also transport water for self-flowing irrigation and navigation, power generation, and improve soil. In addition to managing the existing rivers, ditches, and canals, five new canals will be excavated with seven major rivers as the backbone.

In order to realize this grand plan, the meeting also formulated nine specific measures.

### 彻底消灭水旱灾害　全面开发水利资源  河南平原要实现河网化

　　彻底消灭水旱灾害　全面开发水利资源
    河南平原要实现河网化
    本报讯　河南日报曾以“水利建设的新措施”为题发表社论说：最近，商丘专区和信阳专区的遂平县先后提出了实现河网化的初步规划；新乡专区决定大搞蓄水工程，要求动员八十万劳力，在秋收前后实现水库坑塘化、河网化，长垣等县人民已开始行动起来。这是新形势下的新措施。它给我们提出了平原地区根本改变自然面貌，根治水旱灾害，全面开发水利资源的正确方向。
    社论说：平原地区为实现河网化而斗争，是我省水利建设进入了新阶段的新措施。实现了河网化，不是二百公厘或三百公厘不成灾，而是五百公厘甚至一千公厘不成灾；不是百日无雨保丰收，而是一年无雨保丰收。我们在水利建设中，充分开发水利资源的办法，是把天上水蓄起来，地下水挖出来，河水利用起来，实现河网化就完全可以解决这个问题。河网化不但能充分地蓄水，把平原地区全部径流蓄起来，随时可以取用，在遇到特大降雨时，还可以排泄。过去内涝成灾的主要原因，是内外水顶托，外水较高，内水出不来。实现了河网化，沟沟相通，河河相连，就是最大的雨量，在超过蓄水能力时，也可从容不迫地予以处理。新开河道都挖至地下水位下二至三公尺，并在河底下泉，结合机井化，可以全面开发地下水，在任何干旱情况下，也有充分水源进行灌溉。由于河河相通，也就能够合理利用河水。因此，河网化是汇总“三水”综合利用的完善办法，是平原地区根治水旱灾害的根本措施。
    水利建设的新阶段，意味着水利建设不仅为农业服务，而且要让水为工业、交通、发电各方面服务。水是国家的无穷财富，降在地面上的每一滴水，不是要利用一次，而是要多次的利用，多方面的利用。开挖河道修建闸坝，不仅有利于蓄水，不仅可以解决工农业生产用水，而且可以利用水位高差修建发电站。实现河网化，河河相通，还可以有效解决目前工农业大跃进中迫切急需解决的交通运输问题。河网化将使乡乡社社通木船，县县通轮船，大大减少农村运输的劳力。因之，实现河网化，给工农业大跃进解决交通、电力问题提供了极为有利的条件，它可以很好地为钢铁、粮食、机电三大“元帅”服务。
    据河南日报消息　为了彻底消灭水旱灾害，争取明年实现粮食亩产双千斤专区，中共河南商丘地委最近连续召开了会议，对水利建设进行了系统的研究，确定了全专区的河网化的初步规划——尽快尽早地实现灌溉自流化、旱田水稻化、水力电气化、水利机械化、库塘水产化、沟河航运化。
    会议确定了河网化规划的轮廓是：引黄河水南下，调沙河水北上，地上、地下水一齐开发，东西南北互济，开挖运河三千里，纵横贯通七大河流，兴建五十处枢纽工程（每处五座工程），兴建大型水库，配合中型工程实现河网化，奠定“六化”基础。办法是对大、中、小河、沟和干、支、斗渠都要全面开发，阶梯治理，综合利用。将河、沟、渠道挖深加大，纵横交织，串连各个坑塘水库，并在沟河渠道上节节兴建枢纽工程和各式各样的控制工程，组成一个一脉相连的有机整体。通过它，既能蓄水除旱防涝，又能输水自流灌溉和航运、发电，并能改良土壤。除治理现有河道、沟、渠外，并以七大河流为骨干，新开挖五条运河。
    为了实现这一宏伟的规划，会议还制定九项具体的措施。
