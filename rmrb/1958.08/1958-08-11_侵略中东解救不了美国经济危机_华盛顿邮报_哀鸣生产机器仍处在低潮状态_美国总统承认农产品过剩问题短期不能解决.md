Xinhua News Agency, 9th, New York dispatch: After the United States launched its armed invasion of Lebanon, some bourgeois newspapers in the United States blatantly hoped that the tense situation in the Near and Middle East caused by this intervention would stimulate the activities of American industry and commerce, which were in crisis. But now they admit that this hope has not been realized.

After the US and British troops landed in Lebanon and Jordan in mid-July, some American economists and several business magazines predicted that the US invasion of Korea in 1950 played a stimulating role in resolving the US economic "recession" from 1948 to 1949, and that in the current, more severe economic crisis, the Near and Middle East events might play the same role. For example, the "Washington Post" reported that "foreign tensions are the source of the main stimulus for (the US economy)," "American economists are now estimating that the emergency in the Near East may reduce the expected number of unemployed in the next year by as many as one million, although recent figures still indicate an increase in unemployment."

The hopes of some American capitalists for the Near and Middle East crisis were most clearly reflected in the surge in stock prices that began with the landing of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan. The Dow Jones index of US industrial stock prices rose from 476.89 on July 14 to 501.76 on July 25, and recently rose to 510.13, almost reaching an unprecedented record high. The "New York Herald Tribune" explained in its financial column why stock prices soared, admitting that one of the reasons was the stimulus from the Near and Middle East events, which required larger military expenditures.

Many speculators also began to increase their purchases after the United States launched its armed invasion of Middle Eastern countries. "Business Week" pointed out that at the beginning of the second half of July, the prices of urgently needed goods "rose more than at any time since the Suez Crisis." Associated Press commentator Dawson reported that the Near and Middle East crisis "stimulated the rise in commodity prices." According to the "Journal of Commerce," the prices of copper, tin, and other non-ferrous metals fluctuated sharply due to the Middle East crisis. In addition, the production of the steel and oil industries, as well as the shipping industry, have also improved and risen due to the Near and Middle East events.

"Journal of Commerce" editor Rudick even bluntly stated that the recent level of US business activity will depend on the Near and Middle East events. He said that there seem to be three factors that can promote "economic recovery": First, the government must increase military spending; second, the Near and Middle East events may dispel people's desire to reduce inventories, and may even promote hoarding (at least during the acute phase of the current crisis); third, if the Middle East crisis drags on, this may stimulate employers to purchase goods for long-term use. Rudick advocated that "huge sums must continue to be spent to manufacture modern weapons, and in addition, the necessary funds must be allocated to prepare to meet the needs of a Korean-type war."

However, this war hysteria and the "cardiotonic" effect of the US armed invasion on the US economic crisis did not last. Steel production, after a brief rebound, began to fall again. In the week ending on the 9th, the steel industry's operating rate fell to 59.7%, after having previously rebounded to 65%. Automobile production in the same week fell 44% compared with the same period last year.

On the other hand, according to a report by the US news agency on the 8th, the situation of massive unemployment among workers—one of the indicators of the economic crisis—is still deteriorating in the United States. The Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor announced that in June of this year, the total number of unemployed people in the United States was still 5,294,000. The proportion of unemployed people in the total labor force increased from 6.8% in June to 7.3% in July. Among the 149 major industrial centers, 89 were areas with a large number of unemployed people.

The agricultural situation is even more depressed, with large quantities of agricultural products unable to be sold and large numbers of farmers facing bankruptcy. The Bureau of Census announced on the 8th that from 1956 to April 1958, the rural population of the United States decreased by 1.43 million, and in the past eight years, it decreased by a total of 4,231,000. Americans who have no way out in rural areas are now flocking to cities in large numbers, but they cannot find jobs in cities either. As for the problem of agricultural product "surpluses," US President Eisenhower said in a report to Congress on the 5th that the problem of US "surplus" agricultural products will exist for at least five years.

The "Washington Post" said sadly that the American "production machine is currently still in a slump," "In short, even the most optimistic predictions for recovery dare not predict that the production level can recover to the level before the (crisis) in a few months."

### 侵略中东解救不了美国经济危机　“华盛顿邮报”哀鸣生产机器仍处在低潮状态　美国总统承认农产品过剩问题短期不能解决

　　侵略中东解救不了美国经济危机
　　“华盛顿邮报”哀鸣生产机器仍处在低潮状态
　　美国总统承认农产品过剩问题短期不能解决
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：在美国发动对黎巴嫩的武装侵略以后，美国某些资产阶级报纸曾经露骨地期望由于这次干涉所造成的中近东紧张局势，会刺激处在危机中的美国工商业的活动。但是现在它们承认，这种期望没有实现。
    在美英军队7月中旬先后在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆以后，美国一些经济学家和实业界的几家杂志曾经预言，在1950年，美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争对于解救1948年到1949年的美国经济“衰退”起了刺激作用，而在目前更加严重的经济危机下，中近东事件也可能起同样的作用。例如“华盛顿邮报”就曾经报道说，“外国的紧张状态是（美国经济）的主要刺激力量的来源”，“美国的经济学家们现在正在估计，近东的紧急局势可能会把预期的下一年的失业人数减少一百万人之多，虽然最近的数字仍然表示失业有增加。”
    某些美国资本家对中近东危机所抱的希望最明显地反映在美英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆开始的股票牌价暴涨方面。道·琼斯公司所公布的美国工业公司股票牌价指数从7月14日的四七六·八九上涨到7月25日的五○一·七六，最近又涨到五一○·一三，差不多达到空前未有的最高纪录。“纽约先驱论坛报”在财经栏解释股票牌价为什么暴涨时承认，其中一个原因就是受到需要更庞大的军事开支的中近东事件的刺激。
    许多投机商人在美国发动对中东国家的武装侵略后也开始增加他们的购买量。“商业周刊”指出，在7月下半月开始的时候，急需商品的价格“比苏伊士危机以来的任何时候上涨得都要多”。美联社评论员道逊报道，中近东危机
  “刺激了商品价格的上涨”。据“商务日报”说，铜、锡和其他有色金属的价格，由于中东危机而发生了剧烈的波动。此外，钢铁、石油工业的生产以及航运业也都因为中近东事件而有所好转和上升。
    “商务日报”编辑卢迪克甚至毫不讳言地说，最近美国企业活动的水平将取决于中近东事件。他说，看来现在有三个因素可以助长“经济的恢复”：第一、政府一定要增加军事开支；第二、中近东事件可能打消人们减少存货的愿望，甚至可能促进囤积存货（起码在当前危机的尖锐阶段时如此）；第三、假如中东危机拖长，这可能刺激顾主购买有长期用途的商品。卢迪克鼓吹“必须继续开支巨额款项用来制造现代化武器，此外，还必须拨出一笔必要的款项来准备满足朝鲜类型战争的需要”。
    但是，这种战争歇斯底里的叫嚣以及美国武装侵略行动对美国经济危机所起的“强心针”作用没有持久。钢铁工业的生产在一度回升后又开始下跌，在到9日为止的一周中，钢铁工业开工率下跌到59.7％，而在这以前曾回升到65％。小汽车生产在同一周内比去年同期下降44％。
    另一方面，据美国通讯社8日报道说，作为经济危机的指标之一——工人大量失业的情况目前在美国还在恶化着。商务部和劳工部宣布，在今年6月份，美国的全失业人数仍然有五百二十九万四千人。失业人数在整个劳动力中所占比重从6月份的6.8％增加为7月份的7.3％。在一百四十九个大工业中心中，就有八十九个是失业人数众多的地区。
    农业情况更为不景气，大批农产品卖不出去和大批农民陷于破产。国情普查局8日宣布，从1956年到1958年4月，美国农村人口减少了一百四十三万人，而在过去八年内一共减少了四百二十三万一千人。在农村没有出路的美国人现在正大量涌入城市，但是他们在城市同样找不到职业。至于农产品“过剩”问题，美国总统艾森豪威尔5日在向国会提出的报告中说，美国“剩余”农产品的问题至少还要存在五年。
    “华盛顿邮报”十分悲哀地说，美国的“生产机器目前仍处在低潮状态”，“总而言之，即使对复元作最乐观的预言也不敢预测生产水平过几个月就能够恢复到（危机）以前的水平”。
