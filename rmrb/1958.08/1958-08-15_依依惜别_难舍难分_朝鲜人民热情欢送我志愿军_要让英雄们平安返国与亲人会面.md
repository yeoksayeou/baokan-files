　　Parting with reluctance, hard to separate
　　Korean people warmly bid farewell to the Chinese People's Volunteers
　　Wishing the heroes a safe return home to reunite with their families
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: For more than a month, the second group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home have been warmly seen off by the broad masses of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army as they withdrew from Korea. Following the affectionate farewell on June 26th by Premier Kim Il-sung and other party and government leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Pyongyang rally of people from all walks of life to bid farewell to the second group of returning Chinese People's Volunteers, the party and government leading organs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea dispatched four delegations, and many provinces, cities, and counties also sent delegations to bid farewell to the six divisions and special forces units of the returning Chinese People's Volunteers. Tens of thousands of Korean people and People's Army officers and soldiers taking over the defense near the bases of the returning Chinese People's Volunteers also joined the Volunteers day and night, rain or shine, in one farewell gathering after another.
    The Korean people praised the heroic achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the cause of opposing American imperialist aggression and defending peace in thousands of words, and presented the most precious gifts to the officers and soldiers as souvenirs. At the initiative of Wu Dan-shi, a family member of a People's Army martyr in a certain county, more than 3,000 Korean women spent three months embroidering a very exquisite brocade banner, stitch by stitch, and presented it to the victorious tank unit returning home. Lin Yingzi, a student at a girls' senior high school in a certain city, gave the Chinese People's Volunteers three bronze bowls that she had salvaged from the ashes after her home was burned down by the American-Li bandit army. When the officers and soldiers boarded the vehicles to head to the train station more than forty li away, the people who came to see them off reluctantly grabbed their hands, forcing the officers and soldiers to get out of the vehicles and link arms tightly to walk together. As they passed through each village along the way, they were repeatedly stopped by the Korean people who had been waiting all night on the road, and joined in farewell gatherings under the moonlight. Then, the Korean people merged into an even longer stream of farewell, escorting the returning Chinese People's Volunteers to the train station in a mighty procession.
    Under the slogan of "Let the heroes return home comfortably, pleasantly, and safely to meet their families," the broad masses of the Korean people and the People's Army officers and soldiers also gave the returning Chinese People's Volunteers great care and assistance in all aspects. Before the returning Chinese People's Volunteers boarded the trains, railway workers and local people at various stations in Korea repaired the roads and platforms at the stations day and night, regardless of wind and rain, cleaned and decorated the carriages, and added lighting equipment to all stations. The broad masses of the Korean people also repaired and paved the roads leading from the troops' bases to the train stations and sprinkled water on the dry roads. Tea stations were set up in all towns and stations, with washing water available, and many Korean women carried baskets of watermelons, apples, and tomatoes on their heads to give to the returning officers and soldiers to quench their thirst.

　　依依惜别　难舍难分
　　朝鲜人民热情欢送我志愿军
　　要让英雄们平安返国与亲人会面
    据新华社平壤14日电　中国人民志愿军第二批归国部队一个多月来在撤离朝鲜的时候，受到朝鲜广大人民和人民军的盛情欢送。继6月26日金日成首相等朝鲜民主主义人民共和国党政领导人，在平壤各界人民欢送志愿军第二批归国部队大会上的亲切送别后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国党政领导机关共派出四个代表团，许多道、市和郡也分别派出代表团，到志愿军归国部队的六个师和特种兵部队进行了欢送。志愿军归国部队驻地附近的成千上万的朝鲜人民和接防的人民军官兵们，也都不分晴雨和昼夜，同志愿军官兵们一处又一处地联欢、话别。
    朝鲜人民以千言万语赞扬志愿军官兵们在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫和平事业中的丰功伟绩，并且把最珍贵的礼物赠送给官兵们作纪念。某郡三千多位朝鲜妇女在人民军烈士家属吴丹石倡议下，用三个月的时间，一针一线地绣了一面非常精致的锦旗，赠给了凯旋归国的坦克部队。某市女子高级中学学生林英子把她的家在被美李匪军烧毁后从灰烬里捡出来的三个铜碗，赠给志愿军官兵。当官兵们乘坐汽车向四十多里外的火车站进发时，欢送的人们都难舍难离地拉住他们的手不放，使官兵们只好全部下车，一起紧紧地挽住手臂行进。他们在经过沿途每一个村庄时，也被彻夜等候在路上的朝鲜人民，一次又一次地拦住去路，在月色下进行联欢，然后，朝鲜人民又汇成更长的欢送巨流，浩浩荡荡地伴送志愿军归国部队到火车站。
    在“让英雄们舒适愉快、平安返国和亲人见面”的口号下，广大朝鲜人民和人民军官兵还从各方面给了志愿军归国部队以极大关怀和帮助。在志愿军归国部队登车之前，朝鲜各个车站的铁道员工和当地群众曾不分昼夜、不避风雨地整修了车站上的道路和月台，把车厢进行清扫和装饰，并且在所有的车站上都增加了照明设备。广大朝鲜人民还把从部队驻地通向火车站的道路，进行了修铺，在干燥的道路上洒了水。所有的城镇、车站上都设有茶水站，备有洗脸水，许多朝鲜妇女还顶着一筐筐的西瓜、苹果和西红柿，送给归国官兵们解渴。
