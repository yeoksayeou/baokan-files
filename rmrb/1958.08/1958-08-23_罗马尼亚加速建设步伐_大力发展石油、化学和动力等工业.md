Bucharest Dispatch, August 22nd: On the eve of Romania's National Day (August 23rd), this newspaper's reporter, Ding Man, interviewed the Vice-Chairman of the Romanian State Planning Committee, Con. Tuzzu. He introduced to the reporter Romania's achievements in industry, agriculture, science, culture, and people's lives since liberation; these achievements convincingly demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

Con. Tuzzu said that August 23rd is the greatest holiday for our people, because it signifies a fundamental turning point in our people's lives. In the past, imperialist monopoly capital turned our country into an agricultural country and a raw material supply base for advanced capitalist countries. This situation is now gone forever. This is the most important achievement our people have won.

Speaking about the achievements of socialist construction, Con. Tuzzu said that Romania's national economy has achieved tremendous development and achievements since its liberation in 1944. Compared with 1938, the highest level before liberation, the total industrial output value last year increased by 2.5 times, grain output increased by about a quarter, and national income doubled.

In the industrial sector, the means of production in 1957 increased to 4.5 times that of 1938, and consumer goods increased to 2.7 times. The development of heavy industry has been particularly rapid, with the output of the machinery manufacturing industry increasing more than sevenfold. The growth rate of Romania's main industrial sector, oil production, is much faster than that of countries like Venezuela and Iran, which are known for their rich oil resources. This year's oil production will reach 11.3 million tons, an increase of 6.3 million tons compared to 1950. Oil product exports this year will increase by 60% compared to 1950. In the past, 95% of the machinery and equipment needed by Romania were imported, but last year's machinery exports exceeded imports.

Currently, Romania is paying close attention to developing industries with ample raw materials, such as petroleum, chemical, power, non-ferrous metals, and building materials industries. The chemical industry occupies an important position in the thirty huge industrial and mining projects currently under construction. This year, the output of the chemical industry will increase by 5.8 times compared to 1950, of which the output of chemical fertilizers will increase by 39.4 times.

Speaking about the development of agriculture, Con. Tuzzu said: The Romanian Workers' Party and the government are very concerned about the development of agriculture. The work of agricultural cooperation is progressing successfully. In the nine years since 1949, more than half of the farmers have voluntarily participated in socialist labor organizations. Last year's grain harvest reached 11 million tons, greatly exceeding the highest annual output before liberation. The level of agricultural mechanization has greatly increased, with the number of tractors increasing from 4,858 in 1938 to 36,700 in 1957. The use of mineral fertilizers in agriculture increased thirteenfold in 1957.

With the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the material living conditions of the working people have greatly improved. The actual wages in 1957 increased by 48% compared to 1950. The average per capita consumption of sugar was 5.5 kilograms in 1938, and it increased to 14.4 kilograms in 1957.

The Romanian Party and government are constantly striving to meet the material and cultural needs of the people. Unemployment has been permanently eradicated here, and illiteracy has been basically eliminated. Before 1950, Romania had only three or four technical and agricultural research institutions. Due to the needs of industrialization, the Academy of Sciences has now established ten physical, chemical, and technical research units. Various government ministries also have twenty such research institutions. Higher education has also developed greatly. The number of graduates in 1939 was 5,070, while this year it will reach 11,000.

The state's expenditure on social, cultural, and welfare programs is increasing year by year. In 1957, this expenditure increased eightfold compared to 1938 and doubled compared to 1950, and this year it has increased by another 700 million lei.

Con. Tuzzu concluded by saying that, based on the experience accumulated and the political and economic conditions created in realizing the national economic plan, as well as the tremendous assistance from the Soviet Union and the fraternal cooperation of other socialist countries, Romania has the necessity and the possibility to formulate a fifteen-year long-term plan for the development of the national economy.

　　罗马尼亚加速建设步伐
    大力发展石油、化学和动力等工业
    本报布加勒斯特22日电　在罗马尼亚国庆节（8月23日）前夕，本报记者丁曼访问了罗马尼亚国家计划委员会副主席康·图祖，他向记者介绍了罗马尼亚解放以来在工业、农业、科学文化和人民生活等方面的成就；这些成就令人信服地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    康·图祖说，8月23日是我国人民最大的节日，因为它意味着我国人民生活的一个根本转折点。过去帝国主义垄断资本把我国变成了农业国和先进资本主义国家的原料供应地，这种情况现在是一去不复返了，这是我国人民争取到的最重要的成就。
    在谈到社会主义建设的成就时，康·图祖说，罗马尼亚国民经济从1944年解放以来已经取得了巨大的发展和成就。同解放前水平最高的1938年相比，去年工业总产值增加了二点五倍，粮食产量约增加了四分之一，国民收入增加了一倍。
    在工业方面，1957年生产资料增加到1938年的四点五倍，消费资料增加到二点七倍。重工业的发展特别迅速，其中机器制造业的产量增加到七倍多。罗马尼亚主要工业部门石油产量的增长速度比委内瑞拉、伊朗这样一些以石油资源丰富而闻名的国家快得多。今年的石油产量将达一千一百三十万吨，比1950年增加六百三十万吨。石油产品的出口今年比1950年将增加60％。罗马尼亚过去必需的机器设备中，进口货占95％，但是去年的机器输出量超过了进口量。
    现在，罗马尼亚非常注意发展有充足原料的工业，如石油、化学、动力、有色金属和建筑材料工业等。目前在兴建三十个巨大的工矿工程中，化学工业占有重要的地位。化学工业的产量今年将比1950年增长五点八倍，其中化肥的产量将增长三十九点四倍。
    在谈到农业发展的情况时，康·图祖说：罗马尼亚工人党和政府很关心农业的发展。农业合作化的工作正在成功地进行着。从1949年以来的九个年头里，有一半以上的农户自愿参加了社会主义的劳动组织。去年粮食的收获量达到一千一百万吨，大大超过了解放前最高年产量。农业机械化水平有了很大增长，拖拉机由1938年的四千八百五十八台增加到1957年的三万六千七百台。农业用矿肥1957年增加了十三倍。
    随着工农业生产的增长，劳动人民的物质生活条件有了很大的改善。1957年的实际工资比1950年增加了48％。1938年平均每人消费糖五点五公斤，1957年增加到十四点四公斤。
    罗马尼亚党和政府不断地致力于满足人民的物质和文化需求。在这里失业已经永远绝迹，文盲已基本上扫除。1950年以前，罗马尼亚只有三、四个技术和农业研究机构。由于工业化的需要，目前科学院已设立了十个物理化学和技术研究单位。政府各部还有二十个这样的研究机构。高等学校也大大发展了，1939年毕业生人数是五千零七十名，而今年将达到一万一千名。
    国家在社会文化福利方面的支出一年比一年增加。1957年这方面的支出比1938年增加了八倍，比1950年增加了两倍，今年又增加了七亿列伊。
    康·图祖最后说，基于实现国家经济计划方面所积累的经验和所创造出来的政治经济条件，以及苏联的巨大帮助和其他社会主义国家的兄弟合作，罗马尼亚已有必要和可能制订发展国民经济的十五年远景计划。（附图片）
