Take advantage of the superiority of large communes
    The Iron and Steel People's Commune Runs Schools Through Self-Reliance
    Begins to Systematically Cultivate Technical Forces

    Henan Daily reports: The Iron and Steel People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, relying on the superiority of large communes, adopted the method of self-reliance in running schools and combining education with productive labor, and began the work of systematically cultivating technical forces.

    The Iron and Steel People's Commune has more than 9,000 households, a population of 50,000, and 120,000 mu of land. In the high tide of the all-round leap forward of socialism, summer agricultural production has achieved unprecedented harvests, with an average wheat yield of 625 jin per mu, and the highest yield per unit area reaching 4,020 jin. At the same time, the entire commune has eliminated illiteracy and universalized primary school education. The vast number of commune members are working day and night to strive for even greater harvests in the autumn. With the high-speed development of production, in order to continue the leap forward and create even higher yield miracles, there is an urgent need to cultivate technical forces and learn scientific and technological knowledge.

    Based on this situation, the Party Committee of the Iron and Steel People's Commune, on the one hand, established a Red and Expert University of Industry and Agriculture to organize commune members to participate in learning. At the same time, relying on the superiority of the large commune, it decided to open an agricultural technical secondary school. Each production team recommends a group of Party members, League members, and activists who have a cultural level equivalent to that of a higher primary school graduate and are between the ages of sixteen and twenty to participate in the study. The secretary of the commune Party committee serves concurrently as the principal, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the First Production Team serves concurrently as the political teacher, and cadres from the county technical station serve as technical teachers. The commune allocated three houses, which serve as both classrooms and dormitories. Currently, the school has a total of 48 students. It initially offers two courses: politics and technology, and plans to add courses in Chinese and mathematics. The study period is set for two years, and after graduation, students will serve as technicians or production team leaders in the commune.

    The teaching plan of this school is to study scientific and technological knowledge related to crops according to the production season. The teaching purpose is to directly serve the development of agricultural production and the creation of high yields in the autumn of 5,000 jin of seed cotton, 10,000 jin of rice, 1,000 jin of sesame, and 400,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. In order to closely integrate learning, production, and scientific research, the commune specially allocated 40 mu of land to the school, named it the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" garden, for students to conduct various production experiments and gradually achieve "supporting the school with the garden."

    After the agricultural technical secondary school opened in May, some students were ideologically opposed to participating in productive labor at the school, believing that "it is better to work at home." The secretary of the commune Party committee gave them reports and organized free discussion, making everyone further clarify that participating in productive labor is to better train themselves, combine theory with practice, and cultivate themselves into socialist and communist builders who have both practical labor skills and experience, as well as cultural and scientific knowledge, thus making everyone more motivated. The students get up at the fifth watch (3-5 AM) and sleep in the middle of the night, study in the early morning and evening, attend classes in the morning, and go to the fields for labor after lunch until dark. Currently, there are various cultivation experiments of sesame and sweet potatoes in the garden, as well as mixed planting experiments of corn and radish. In terms of variety experiments, a total of 60 kinds of sesame, 130 kinds of soybeans, and more than ten kinds of sweet potatoes have been tried. Various crops are growing vigorously. The students also gave play to the spirit of daring to think and daring to do. They wanted to make soybeans grow into trees, so they grafted soybeans with locust trees. In order to make soybeans bear larger beans, they grafted soybeans with cowpeas. In order to make rice resistant to drought, pests, and lodging, and become perennial, they grafted rice with reed grass. In order to grow 100-jin sweet potatoes, they grafted sweet potatoes with moonflowers. They also grafted cotton with impatiens, so that it would grow into colored cotton, and grafted sweet potatoes with pumpkins, so that it would grow into a "two-story building." Currently, many things have been successfully grafted. In addition, they also injected protein into sweet potato seedlings, making the sweet potato grow exceptionally lush. The effective experiences successfully tested in the school are promptly promoted throughout the commune. For example, they found that spreading chaff in rice fields to prevent leakage was effective, so they immediately spread it to various teams. They also frequently invite cadres and masses from various teams to visit their experimental garden and give commune members technical knowledge.

　　发挥大社的优越性
    钢铁人民公社自力更生办学
    开始有计划地培养技术力量
    河南日报报道  河南省遂平县钢铁人民公社依靠大社的优越性，采取了自力更生办学和教育与生产劳动相结合的方法，开始有计划地培养技术力量的工作。
    钢铁人民公社共有九千多户，五万人口和土地十二万亩。在社会主义全面大跃进的高潮中，夏季农业生产获得了空前丰收，小麦平均亩产六百二十五斤，最高单位面积产量达到四千零二十斤。同时，全公社已扫除了文盲，普及了小学教育。广大社员正在为争取秋季更大的丰收而日夜苦干。随着生产的高速度发展，为了继续跃进，创造更高的丰产奇迹，迫切需要培养技术力量和学习科学技术知识。
    钢铁人民公社党委会根据这种情况，一方面举办了工农业红专大学，组织社员普遍参加学习。同时，依靠大社的优越性，决定开办一所农业技术中学，由各生产队保送一批具有高小毕业文化水平、年龄都在十六岁至二十岁的党、团员和积极分子参加学习，由公社党委书记兼任校长，第一生产队团支部书记兼任政治教师，县技术站干部担任技术教师。公社拨给三间房子，是教室也是寝室。现在，这所学校共有学生四十八名。先设政治、技术两门课，并且准备增设语文、数学课程。学习期限定为两年，学生毕业后担任社内生产队的技术员或生产队长。
    这所学校的教学计划是随着生产季节学习有关作物的科学技术知识，教学目的就是直接为发展农业生产和创造秋季亩产五千斤籽棉、一万斤水稻、一千斤芝麻和四十万斤红薯的高额产量服务。为了使学习、生产、科学研究三者紧密结合，社里特地拨给学校四十亩地，命名为“百花齐放”园地，由学员们进行各种生产试验活动，并逐步做到“以园养校”。
    农业技术中学在5月开学后，有的学生对在学校参加生产劳动思想不通，认为：“这样还不如在家劳动”。公社党委书记就向他们做报告，组织鸣放辩论，使大家进一步明确了参加生产劳动是为了更好地锻炼自己，使理论和实际相结合，把自己培养成为既有实际劳动技能和经验，又有文化科学知识的社会主义和共产主义建设人材，因而大家干劲更足。学员们起五更、睡半夜，早晚自习，上午上课，午饭后下地劳动一直到天黑。目前，园地里有芝麻、红薯的各种栽培试验，有玉米萝卜混作试验，在品种试验方面共试种了六十种芝麻，一百三十种大豆和十多种红薯，各种庄稼都长得很茂盛。学员们还发挥了敢想敢干的精神，他们想叫豆子长成树，就用大豆与洋槐嫁接。为了使大豆结得更大，就用大豆与梅豆嫁接。为了使水稻能抗旱、抗病虫、抗倒伏变成多年生，就用水稻与淮草嫁接。为了要长百斤大红薯，就用红薯和月光花嫁接。他们还用棉花和凤仙花嫁接，让它长成带色棉，用红薯与南瓜嫁接，让它长成“两棚楼”。目前许多东西都已接活。此外，他们还给红薯秧内注射蛋白质，使这棵红薯长得分外茂盛。学校中试验成功的有效经验，就及时向全社推广。比如，他们发现稻田撒糠防漏有效，便立即向各队传播。他们还经常邀请各队干部、群众到他们的试验园地参观，给社员讲技术知识。
