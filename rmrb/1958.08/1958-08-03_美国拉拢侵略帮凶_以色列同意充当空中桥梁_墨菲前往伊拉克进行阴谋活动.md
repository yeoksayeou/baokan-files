Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd. According to TASS, Tel Aviv, August 1st: American President's "Special Envoy" Murphy concluded his negotiations with Israeli leaders here on August 1st.

The newspapers emphasized that Murphy's visit to Israel was a direct continuation of his negotiations with King Hussein of Jordan. "The Daily Mail" believes that during Murphy's negotiations with the Israeli Prime Minister, the issue of transporting American troops to Jordan via Israeli territory was mentioned.

Tel Aviv journalists pointed out that Murphy's proposal to use Israel as an "air bridge" to achieve these goals received the "full understanding" of the Israeli ruling clique. For two weeks, this bridge has been used to transport British paratroopers to Jordan. "The Daily Mail" wrote that in exchange, Ben-Gurion "raised the issue of providing Israel with American arms" and demanded that the US government provide Israel with "security guarantees."

The newspapers pointed out that an agreement was also reached in Tel Aviv on Israel's armed intervention in the event of a sharp deterioration in the situation in Jordan. "People's Voice" emphasized that "in this regard, Ben-Gurion and his cronies have prepared an action plan."

    美国拉拢侵略帮凶
    以色列同意充当空中桥梁
    墨菲前往伊拉克进行阴谋活动
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫1日讯：美国总统“特使”墨菲8月1日在这里结束了同以色列领导人的谈判。
    报纸强调指出，墨菲访问以色列是他同约旦国王侯赛因的谈判的直接延续。“每日卫报”认为，在墨菲同以色列总理的谈判中提到了经过以色列领土把美军运往约旦的问题。
    特拉维夫新闻界人士指出，墨菲提出的利用以色列“空中桥梁”来实现这些目的的建议得到了以色列统治集团的“充分谅解”。两周以来这座桥梁已经用来运送英国伞兵到约旦去。“每日卫报”写道，作为交换条件，本—古里安“提出了关于为以色列提供美国武装的问题”，并且要求美国政府给予以色列以“安全保证”。
    各报指出，特拉维夫还达成了关于一旦约旦的局势尖锐化以色列将进行武装干涉的协议。“人民呼声报”强调指出，“在这方面，本—古里安及其亲信已经准备了行动计划”。
