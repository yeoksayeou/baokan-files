    Breaking Down Superstitions in Art
    Yi Qun
    In our literary and art circles, there are still quite a few superstitions, fears, feelings of inferiority, and a spirit of listlessness and willingness to remain downstream. These mental states manifest in different ways. Some manifest as valuing the past over the present, praising the old while denigrating the new; some manifest as prioritizing the foreign over the domestic, revering the foreign and belittling the local; some manifest as superstitious belief in our own classical literature and art; some manifest as worship of Western bourgeois literature and art… Although the modes of expression are different, and the degree of harm varies, what they have in common is a lack of confidence, a lack of courage, a lack of a spirit of bold creation, and a lack of the fearless, lofty style of communism.
    If we do not thoroughly change this mental state, then good things can also be turned into bad things. For example, it was originally a good thing for our drama circles to study the Stanislavski system. Studying the Stanislavski system is necessary for both directors and actors in our drama troupes, and, in fact, this study has indeed greatly promoted the level of our performing arts. The only question is how to learn it. As Chinese performing artists, we must first draw valuable things from the national traditional drama arts and our own drama experience. The Stanislavski system itself was extracted and organized from the theatrical practice of Russia and the Soviet Union. Stanislavski not only creatively engaged in theatrical performance and directing on the theatrical stage throughout his life, never breaking away from the Russian theatrical tradition, but also absorbed many valuable things from Russian national opera and dance. However, some of our drama workers have detached themselves from the tradition of national drama art, from their own stage practice experience, especially from the political direction and mass line of drama, to carry out isolated, academic study of the Stanislavski system. This turns the living Stanislavski system into a dead dogma. This dogmatic method of learning must be opposed. When our directors and actors hear Peking Opera masters such as Mei Lanfang, Gai Jiaotian, and Zhou Xinfang talk about their artistic insights, they often exclaim, "It's really true! This is consistent with the principles of Stanislavski!" However, some drama artists rarely study the excellent experience of traditional opera performance art, and rarely pay attention to systematically exploring some principles in traditional opera performance art that are consistent with the Stanislavski system or that are not found in the Stanislavski system. Even in terms of drama itself, it has already had fifty years of history in China, and has cultivated many accomplished actors from stage practice, who all have their own experiences and characteristics. However, these seem to arouse little interest and attention from some of our drama workers. A Soviet expert from the Shanghai Theatre Academy visited the Shanghai Opera School and found that their training exercises were very useful and scientific for the physical training of drama actors. When he returned to the Theatre Academy, he began to promote it among the students. These two schools are on the same street, one could say they are neighbors, but the training methods of the Opera School have never attracted the attention of the professors at the Theatre Academy. In fact, drama actors need to practice, which drama actors all know, but it just doesn't attract people's attention!
    Stanislavski once said in his book "My Life in Art": "Our new roles are not as moving as the old roles we have played. But every generation has its own limits." He said this in 1924, and more than thirty years have passed since he said this! The revolutionary cause of the working class and the working people of the Soviet Union and China has undergone earth-shaking changes and great developments. Can our dramatic art stagnate and not need to be innovated and created?
    Perhaps this cannot be regarded as the most appropriate example of "listlessness" and "willingness to remain downstream," but there should be no doubt that these comrades still have some superstitions, some fears, and some feelings of inferiority in their minds, right? Today, we need to clear these from our minds, and truly establish a spirit of adhering to the truth, breaking superstitions, daring to innovate, and daring to create!

    破除艺术上的迷信
    以群
    在我们的文艺领域里，还是有不少迷信、恐惧和自卑感，以及萎靡不振、甘居下游的精神状态。这种精神状态的表现方式是不一样的，有的表现为厚古薄今，颂古非今；有的表现为重外轻中，崇洋鄙土；有的表现为迷信本国的古典文艺；有的表现为崇拜西方资产阶级文艺……尽管表现方式不同，危害的程度也各有差别，但他们的缺乏信心，缺乏勇气，缺乏大胆创造的精神，缺乏无所畏惧的共产主义的崇高风格，却是共同的。
    如果不彻底改变这种精神状态，那么好事情也会办成坏事情。譬如我们话剧界学习斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系，原是一件好事情。学习斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系，在我们的话剧团体中，无论对于导演和演员也都是必要的，而且，事实上，这种学习对于我们的表演艺术水平也确实有了很大的推进。问题只在于如何学法。作为中国的表演艺术家，首先必须从民族传统的戏剧艺术以及我们自己的话剧经验中吸取宝贵的东西。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系本身就是从俄国和苏联的演剧实践中提炼和整理出来的。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基不仅毕生在话剧舞台上有创造性地进行话剧的表演和导演的工作，从来没有和俄国的话剧传统脱离，而且还从俄国民族歌剧和舞蹈中吸收了许多宝贵的东西。而我们的某些话剧工作者却是脱离了民族戏剧艺术的传统，脱离了自己舞台实践的经验，特别是脱离了戏剧的政治方向和群众路线，来对斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系作孤立的学院式的学习。这就把活的斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系当作了一种死的教条。这种教条主义的学习方法是必须反对的。我们的导演、演员们听了梅兰芳、盖叫天、周信芳等戏曲大师谈到他们的艺术心得的时候，也常常惊叹说：“真有道理！这和斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的道理是相通的！”可是，某些话剧艺术家却对传统戏曲表演艺术的优秀经验，很少进行学习，也很少注意在传统戏曲的表演艺术中比较系统地发掘出一些与斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系相通的或是斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系中所没有的道理。即以话剧本身而论，在中国也已有五十年的历史，并且从舞台实践中锻炼出了不少有成就的演员，他们都有自己的经验和特点。可是，这些却似乎都引不起我们某些话剧工作者的兴趣和注意。上海戏剧学院的一位苏联专家去参观上海戏曲学校，发现他们那里的练功对话剧演员的形体训练很有用，也很科学，回到戏剧学院就开始在学生中推行起来。这两所学校同在一条马路上，可以说是邻居，可是戏曲学校的训练方法却从来没有引起过戏剧学院的教授们的注意。其实，戏曲演员要练功，话剧演员都知道，只是引不起人们注意而已！
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基在“我的艺术生活”一书中就曾经说过：“我们的新角色不如我们所担当的老角色那样动人。但是，每一代都有它自己的界限。”他这句话是1924年说的，从他说这句话之后又三十多年过去了！苏联和中国的工人阶级和劳动人民的革命事业已有了天翻地复似的大变化和大发展。难道我们的戏剧艺术就可以停滞不前，而不需要革新和创造吗？
    也许，这还不能算“萎靡不振”、“甘居下游”的最恰当的例子，但是，这些同志们头脑里还有某些迷信，某些恐惧，某些自卑感，应该是没有疑问的吧？今天，就需要把这些也从头脑里清除掉，真正树立起坚持真理，破除迷信，勇于革新，勇于创造的精神来！
