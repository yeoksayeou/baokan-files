　　To Have Large Cotton Fields with Abundant Autumn Bolls
　　Hubei Strengthens Late-Stage Management to Strive for a Bumper Cotton Harvest

　　(This report) To strengthen the late-stage management of cotton fields and ensure a bumper cotton harvest this year, Hubei Province held a provincial on-site cotton meeting in Macheng County on July 7th and 8th. It decided on specific measures to further improve cotton production in the future.

　　The 130,000 mu of cotton fields in Macheng County are generally growing well this year. Cotton-wheat double cropping is used in Macheng County’s cotton fields. This year, more than 60,000 mu used nutrient pot seedling transplanting, and the rest were cotton interplanted in wheat rows. The density of cotton fields is 4,000 to 4,500 plants per mu, and the seedlings are complete and strong, with very few missing seedlings. Generally, insect control has been carried out continuously eleven or twelve times in cotton fields. Last month, the cotton fields were severely damaged by the beet armyworm. To treat this emergency more than 300,000 people were mobilized throughout the county to eliminate it in three days. Now, the cotton fields throughout the county are basically free of pests, weeds, and third-class seedlings. The county is launching a campaign to grow 100,000 bolls per mu, striving to become a county producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu.

　　Based on the on-site visits and exchanges from various places, the on-site meeting analyzed the current cotton growth situation in the province, believing that this year's cotton in Hubei Province is growing significantly better than last year, but there are several types of situations: One type is that the plants are developing normally and strongly, with many bolls in the middle and lower parts, but this type of cotton field is relatively small; another type is that the plants have also grown, but the shedding of buds and bolls in the middle part is serious, and there are not many large bolls already formed, this is the most common situation; in addition, some counties also have a small number of third-class seedling cotton fields that have not grown. Based on the above situation, the on-site meeting proposed that it is necessary to effectively strengthen the late-stage management of cotton fields and strive to grow more autumn bolls, which is an important key to ensuring the realization of this year's cotton production leap forward plan. In the past, the masses in Hubei Province had the experience of "half of the cotton bolls come in the summer and half in the autumn"; in Tianmen, Mianyang and other counties, autumn cotton bolls are generally more than two-thirds more than summer bolls, and the bolls are larger and fall off less. This shows that there is great potential for striving for autumn bolls. Therefore, the meeting decided to focus on vigorously growing autumn bolls, preserving summer bolls, and striving for large bolls, and adopted measures such as generally applying boll fertilizer, continuing to thoroughly control insects, paying attention to preventing waterlogging and drought, and strengthening pruning and loosening the soil, and to firmly grasp the late-stage management of cotton fields until the cotton is harvested and stored in warehouses.

### 要大片棉田秋桃累累　湖北加强后期管理力争棉花丰收

　　要大片棉田秋桃累累
　　湖北加强后期管理力争棉花丰收
    本报讯  湖北省为了加强棉田后期管理，保证今年棉花大丰收，7、8两日，在麻城县召开了一个全省棉花现场会，决定了今后进一步抓好棉花生产的具体措施。
    麻城县今年十三万亩棉田普遍生长良好。麻城县棉田是棉麦两熟栽培，今年有六万多亩是采用营养钵育苗移栽，其余是在麦行里套种的棉花。棉田密度每亩四千到四千五百株，苗全苗壮，缺苗断垅的现象很少。一般棉田已连续治虫十一、二次。上个月遭到斜纹夜盗蛾的侵害，来势很猛，全县动员了三十多万人突击除治，三天之内就全部加以扑灭。现在全县棉田基本上做到无虫害、无杂草、无三类苗。全县正在开展每亩十万桃运动，争取实现千斤籽棉县。
    根据现场参观和各地交流的情况，现场会上对目前全省棉花生长情况进行了分析，认为今年湖北省的棉花长得比去年显著好，但有几类情况：一类是植株发育正常健壮，中部、下部结桃都多，这一类棉田比较少；另一类是植株也发起来了，但中部蕾铃脱落严重，目前已结的大桃不很多，这一类情况比较普遍；另外，有些县也还有一小部分棉株没有发起来的三类苗棉田。根据以上情况，现场会议提出必须切实加强棉田后期管理，争取多结秋桃，这是保证实现今年棉花跃进增产规划的重要关键。过去湖北省群众植棉，一向有“伏桃一半、秋桃一半”的经验；天门、沔阳等县棉花一般秋桃要比伏桃多三分之二以上，而且桃大，脱落较少。说明争取秋桃大有可为。因之，会上决定以大搞秋桃、保住伏桃、争取大桃为中心，采取普遍追施桃肥、继续彻底治虫，注意防涝抗旱和加强整枝松土等措施，狠狠地抓住棉田后期管理工作不放，直到收花进仓为止。（附图片）
