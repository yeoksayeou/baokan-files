    Both Athletic Champions and Production Experts
    All Employees of Jiawang Power Plant Participate in Sports Activities
    (Our report) Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Jiawang Power Plant adheres to the principle of sports serving production and serving the health of employees, and mass sports activities are flourishing. Currently, 100% of the plant's employees participate in sports activities.
    Under the reactionary rule before liberation, the physique of the workers of the Jiawang Power Plant was severely damaged, and 15% of the plant's employees suffered from various chronic diseases, which seriously affected production. In 1954, the plant launched workplace exercises, and 85% of the employees persisted in doing the exercises, and also carried out activities such as basketball, football, and table tennis. However, the activities were not very regular. After the rectification campaign, along with the great leap forward in production, sports work also leaped forward by leaps and bounds. Workshops established sports groups, trade union groups were equipped with sports cadres, and the ranks of sports activists were expanded. A new atmosphere appeared in sports activities. At present, the number of employees participating in radio exercises has increased from the original 85% to 100%, the number of basketball teams has increased from nine to twenty-six, and veteran workers have also organized "old men basketball teams." Football, volleyball, table tennis, badminton teams, and exercise groups for calisthenics and weightlifting have also been organized like mushrooms after rain. There are a total of thirty-five sports teams and exercise groups in the plant. In addition to radio exercises, more than 80% of the plant's employees participate in two or more sports activities.
    In recent years, this plant has adhered to the principle of sports serving production and serving the health of employees, which has played a positive role in enhancing the physical fitness of employees, improving attendance rate, and increasing labor productivity. Zhang Bingfu, a fifty-year-old worker, suffered from stomach problems and arthritis for many years. He persisted in running and practicing Tai Chi, and his illness improved, and his interest in sports activities has become even higher. Due to the development of sports activities, the plant's labor attendance rate has increased year by year, from 97% in 1954 to 99% this year. Many sports champions are also production experts. Forty-nine of the plant's seventy-five sports activists have won the honorary titles of advanced producer and labor model, accounting for 55% of the plant's advanced producers.
    Currently, there are already one hundred and nine athletes among the plant's two hundred or so employees.

    是运动健将又是生产能手
    贾汪电厂全体职工参加体育活动
    本报讯  江苏省徐州贾汪电厂坚持贯彻体育为生产服务，为职工健康服务的方针，群众性体育活动蓬勃开展。目前，全厂职工已100％地参加体育活动。
    贾汪电厂的职工，解放前在反动统治下，工人的体质受到严重摧残，全厂15％的职工患有各种慢性病，严重影响生产。1954年厂内开展了工间操，85％的职工坚持做操，并开展了篮球、足球、乒乓球等活动。但活动很不经常。整风后，在生产大跃进的同时，体育工作也大踏步地向前跃进，车间建立了体育组，工会小组中配备体育干事，扩大体育积极分子队伍，体育活动出现了新气象。目前，参加广播操的职工由原来的85％，增加到100％，篮球队由九个增加到二十六个，老工人也组织了“老头篮球队”，足球、排球、乒乓球、羽毛球队和器械操、举重等锻炼小组也都如雨后春笋般地组织起来，全厂共计有三十五个运动队和锻炼小组。全厂职工除广播操外，参加二项以上体育活动的已占80％以上。
    几年来，这个厂坚持贯彻了体育为生产服务、为职工健康服务的方针，对增强职工体质、提高出勤率和劳动生产率起了积极的促进作用。五十岁的老工人张炳富患胃病和关节炎多年，他坚持了跑步、打太极拳，病也好了，对体育活动的兴趣更高了。由于体育运动的开展，全厂劳动出勤率逐年增长，1954年为97％，今年已增加到99％。许多运动健将又是生产上的能手，全厂七十五个体育积极分子有四十九个获得先进生产者和劳动模范的光荣称号，占全厂先进生产者的55％。
    现在全厂二百多职工中已经有一百零九个等级运动员。
