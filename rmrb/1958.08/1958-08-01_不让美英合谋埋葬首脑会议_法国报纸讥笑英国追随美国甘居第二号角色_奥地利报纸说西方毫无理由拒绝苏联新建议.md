Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Paris: The Parisian newspaper "Le Monde" recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent, exposing Britain's delaying tactics on the issue of holding a summit conference, following the United States, and expressing dissatisfaction with the joint manipulation of the North Atlantic Group by the two countries.

The dispatch pointed out that the Soviet proposal for a summit conference on the Middle East issue put British Prime Minister Macmillan in an embarrassing position. On the one hand, he "cannot ignore" the British public's desire for a summit conference, and on the other hand, he is afraid of offending the United States. After "some hesitation, Macmillan finally followed the position of the US State Department," insisting that the Soviet proposal in its current form was "unacceptable."

The dispatch said that in order to "avoid expressing outright rejection," Britain adopted a delaying tactic. The dispatch expressed great dissatisfaction that the United States and Britain did not notify other members of the North Atlantic Group of their actions. The dispatch believes that this "once again shows that the United States and Britain are jointly manipulating and leading the Atlantic alliance, even on issues of peace. Moreover, when entering a truly urgent stage, the joint US-British leadership becomes the US State Department's command; while Britain gratefully contents itself with the role of second fiddle."

The dispatch emphasized that certain points in the Soviet proposal "cannot be publicly rejected."

Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Vienna: Vienna's "Neues Österreich" pointed out in its commentary on the Soviet proposal for a summit conference on the Middle East issue that the West could not possibly have any reason to oppose holding such a conference.

The newspaper urged Western countries to "not appear too visibly distressed" at the upcoming summit conference, but to "take the initiative by putting forward constructive proposals." The newspaper said, "Unfortunately, it is worrying that Dulles is not the right person to undertake this task."

Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Washington: The "Washington Post and Times Herald" wrote in an editorial on the 29th, commenting on Khrushchev's latest letter to Eisenhower: "Mr. Khrushchev concludes, for understandable reasons, that Eisenhower and Dulles are in fact unwilling to meet with him in New York. Given the brusque tone of President Eisenhower's most recent note, such a response was entirely predictable. But what has the nation (United States) gained from this?

A large part of the world is convinced that the United States is deliberately sabotaging opportunities to reduce the danger of war. Regrettably, the government's actions are exacerbating the suspicions of some that the United States and Britain do indeed have plans to invade the Near East—suspicions that are reportedly due to the unpopular deployments of troops to Lebanon and Jordan."

The newspaper called on the US government to "sincerely reach a mutual understanding with the Soviet Union."

The "Wall Street Journal" pointed out the US government's attitude of obstructing the holding of a summit conference in a Washington dispatch on the 28th. The newspaper said: "The US government is trying to delay holding a summit conference. Moreover, the US government is preparing: in case preventing the holding of a summit conference fails, it will turn around and condemn the Soviet Union and Egypt as aggressors in the Middle East."

    不让美英合谋埋葬首脑会议
    法国报纸讥笑英国追随美国甘居第二号角色
    奥地利报纸说西方毫无理由拒绝苏联新建议
    新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：巴黎“新闻报”最近刊载该报记者从伦敦发出的一篇通讯，揭露英国在举行最高级会议的问题上追随美国玩弄拖延手法，并对两国联合操纵北大西洋集团表示不满。
    这篇通讯指出，苏联关于召开中东问题最高级会议的建议使英国首相麦克米伦处境尴尬。一方面他“不能忽视”英国舆论要求举行最高级会议的愿望，另一方面他又害怕得罪美国。在“经过一番迟疑之后，麦克米伦终于追随了美国国务院的立场”，硬说目前形式的苏联建议是“不能接受的”。
    通讯说，为了“避免表示断然拒绝”，英国采取了拖延时间的做法。通讯对英美两国没有把它们的行动通知北大西洋集团其他成员国表示很不满意。通讯认为，这“再一次可以看出，是英美两国联合操纵和领导大西洋联盟，甚至在和平成问题的时候也是这样。此外，在进入真正紧急阶段的时际，美英联合领导就变成美国国务院的发号施令；而英国则感激地甘居第二号角色的地位”。
    通讯强调指出，苏联建议中的某些点是“不能公然加以拒绝的”。
    新华社31日讯　维也纳消息：维也纳的“新奥地利报”在评论苏联关于召开中东问题最高级会议的建议时指出，西方不可能有任何理由反对召开这样一次会议。
    这家报纸要西方国家在未来的最高级会议上“不要过分明显地表示苦恼”，而是要“通过提出建设性建议来争取主动”。这家报纸说，“不幸令人担心的是：杜勒斯不是担当这个任务的合适人选。”
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在29日的社论中评论赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的最新信件时写道：“赫鲁晓夫先生根据不难理解的理由得出结论，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯实际上是不愿同他在纽约会晤。根据艾森豪威尔总统最近一次照会的粗暴口吻，这种答复是完全可以预料的。但是国家（美国）从这件事上赢得了什么呢？
    世界上很大一部分人都确信，美国正在蓄意破坏减少战争危险的机会。遗憾的是，政府的行为正在加剧某些人士的怀疑：美国和英国的确有侵略近东的计划——据报道，这种怀疑是由于出兵黎巴嫩和约旦的不得人心所引起的。”
    这家报纸要求美国政府“真诚地同苏联达成互相谅解”。
    “华尔街日报”28日在一则华盛顿电讯中指出了美国政府阻挠召开最高级会议的态度。这家报纸说：“美国政府正在努力拖延举行首脑会议。而且美国政府正在准备：万一阻止举行首脑会议遭到失败，就反过来把苏联和埃及当作侵略中东的国家来加以谴责。”
