　　“Red Glow” Illuminates the Kunqu Opera Stage
　　Ma Shaobo
    The Northern Kunqu Opera Theater recently staged a new Kunqu opera, "Red Glow," adapted from the opera of the same name, and it has been well received by audiences. "Red Glow" depicts the story of a girl named Red Glow in the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi twenty years ago and her heroic struggle against the enemy.
    The Kunqu opera adaptation is well done. The adapters creatively adapted the work based on the spirit of the original and the characteristics of Kunqu opera art, and made beneficial revisions and additions in terms of plot and artistic treatment. For example, a scene was added at the beginning of Red Glow working as a maid in the landlord's house, which made up for the shortcomings of the original work, where the character of Red Glow appeared abruptly and the growth process was too simple; and the traces of "honey trap" were completely erased, protecting the integrity of the character and more fully exerting the power of education. The playwrights added a dog-leg named Feng Shun and a deputy of the pseudo-security brigade, which greatly enhanced the drama's conflict and twists and turns. The most moving scene is this: from the dying testimony of this dog-leg, Red Glow's name is exposed, leading the enemy to search for Red Glow among the villagers by cruel means. But none of the masses were willing to reveal it. When the masses suffered as a result, Red Glow bravely stood up. At this time, the enemy wanted to harm her, but another girl stepped forward and shouted: "I am Red Glow!" In no more than three to five seconds, before the enemy's shock had subsided, another girl stood up and shouted: "I am Red Glow!" Then a group of girls rushed forward and shouted together: "I am Red Glow!" At this moment, the enemy's heart was shattered, and the hearts of the loved ones were boiling. This provided an extremely concentrated and full expression of the noble qualities and heroic spirit of the revolutionary people, and the inseparable relationship between them, and between them and the Red Army. This section is the most moving in the whole play, and it prominently portrays the character of the characters.
    It is rare that the actors of the Kunqu Opera Theater are all full of emotion and perform so well; especially Li Shujun, who plays Red Glow, Hou Yongkui, who plays the captain of the Red Guards, and Bai Yuzhen, who plays the old farmer, the positive images they created are real and moving. The newly compiled Kunqu opera tunes are refreshing and passionate, and the emotions are full; the actors Meng Xiangsheng, Cong Zhaohuan, etc., who play the negative characters, are also quite skilled.
    Of course, the Kunqu opera "Red Glow," like all excellent new works, still has room for meticulous refinement. I feel that the shortcomings are as follows:
    First, the prologue seems superfluous. The playwrights' creative intention was to introduce the theme of the drama to the audience in a general way; but objectively, it is not difficult for the audience to be infected by the theme after watching the performance; moreover, the prologue appears purely in the form of a dance drama, and the style of the whole play is not unified. The new Kunqu opera, at the opening, gives the audience a strong feeling of Kunqu opera, making it consistent from beginning to end. It will be more complete and more attractive, and it will reduce unnecessary ideological resistance to the bold reform of Kunqu opera.
    Second, when Red Glow pretends to agree to lead the way for the enemy, the plot of the masses scolding Red Glow is overdone and inappropriate. Because this damages Red Glow's character and her relationship with the masses. According to the situation stipulated by the plot, Red Glow and the masses should have a deep understanding of each other, and Red Glow's standing up to admit her identity in the midst of the masses' suffering, whether true or false, is relatively easy to understand. Although temporary misunderstandings by individuals are sometimes inevitable, they will never be so unanimously indignant and reproachful. Here, the masses' hatred for the enemy is diverted, which is inappropriate.
    Third, the Kunqu opera "Red Glow" has made great efforts in inheriting and carrying forward the tradition. Whether it is singing, gestures... absorbing, dissolving, and using many Kunqu opera performance methods. But it still makes people feel that the drama component is heavier. Kunqu opera has extremely rich traditional means of expression. If more are retained, more are dissolved and used, that is to say, if it is more "virtual," it will be even better.
    The appearance of "Red Glow" on the Kunqu opera stage is a new milestone in the reform of Kunqu opera. It marks that this type of drama, which expresses historical life, can also directly express the new life of our great era today.

　　“红霞”辉映昆曲舞台
　　马少波
    北方昆曲剧院最近上演了根据同名歌剧改编的新昆剧“红霞”，获得了观众的好评。“红霞”描写了二十年前江西老革命根据地一个名叫红霞的姑娘和敌人英勇斗争的故事。
    昆剧改编本是改得好的。改编者根据原作的精神和昆剧艺术的特点，创造性地进行了改编工作，在故事情节和艺术处理方面都作了有益的修删和补充。例如在前面加了红霞在地主家里当丫头的一场戏，弥补了原作中红霞这个人物来的突兀，成长过程过于简单的缺点；并且彻底抹掉了“美人计”的痕迹，保护了人物性格的完整，更充分地发挥教育力量。编导者增添了一个叫作冯顺的狗腿子和一个伪保安大队附，大大增强了戏剧的冲突和曲折性。最动人的是这样一场：从这个狗腿子垂死的证言中暴露了红霞的名字，引使敌人以残酷的手段在村民中追查红霞。但群众谁也不肯吐露。当群众因此遭难的时候，红霞勇敢地站了出来，这时，敌人要加害于她，可是，另有一个姑娘挺身而出喊道：“我是红霞！”也不过三五秒钟，敌人的惊悸还未定呢，又有一个姑娘站出来喊：“我是红霞！”接着一群姑娘拥到前面一齐喊：“我是红霞！”这当儿，敌人的心震裂了，亲人的心沸腾了，这对于革命人民的高贵品质、英雄气势和她们之间、她们和红军之间骨肉不可分离的关系，有了极其集中充分的表现。全剧中这一节是最动人的，它突出地刻画了人物性格。
    难得昆曲剧院演员们一个个情绪饱满，表演得如此称职；特别饰红霞的李淑君、饰赤卫队长的侯永奎、饰老农民的白玉珍，他们所创造的正面形象，是真实动人的，用重新编制的昆曲调子唱，听来清新激越，感情充沛；扮演反面人物的演员孟祥生、丛兆桓等，也都颇见工力。
    当然，昆剧“红霞”也像所有的优秀的新作品一样，总还是有精雕细刻的余地。我感到不足的地方有以下几点：
    一、序幕似乎是多余的，编导者的创作意图是想把戏剧的主题思想先概括地介绍给观众；但是客观上观众看完演出，是不难受到主题思想的感染的；另则，序幕纯以舞剧形式出现，和整出戏的风格也不统一，新昆剧一开幕，就给观众以浓厚的昆剧的感觉使之贯串到底，始终如一，会更完整，更吸引人，对于昆剧的大胆革新会减少不必要的思想阻力。
    二、当红霞假意答应为敌人带路时，群众责骂红霞的情节，过于渲染，是不妥的。因为这样对红霞的性格和她与群众之间的关系，都有损伤。按剧情所规定的情境来看，红霞在群众中应该相互了解很深的，而红霞在群众危难中挺身自承，真真假假，是比较容易理解的。虽然个别人一时的误解有时难免，但绝不会如此一致地愤起责骂。在这里分散了群众对敌人的仇恨，是不妥的。
    三、昆剧“红霞”在继承传统发扬传统上是尽了很大努力的，无论唱腔、身段……吸收、溶化，运用了不少昆剧的表现方法。但仍使人感到话剧成分重一些。昆剧传统的表现手段极丰富，如果多保留一些，多溶化运用一些，也就是说更“虚”一些就更好了。
    “红霞”在昆剧舞台上的出现，是昆剧改革中一个新的里程碑。它标志着这个表现历史生活的剧种，也可以直接表现我们今天伟大时代的新生活。
