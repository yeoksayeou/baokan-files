Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: People's organizations across our country sent telegrams to relevant Soviet organizations or issued statements today and yesterday, expressing warm support for the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union.

Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, saying: "The Chinese people and all workers warmly welcome and resolutely support the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union. It has great significance and far-reaching impact on the current struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and oppose aggression." The telegram said that the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev once again demonstrated the firm will and great determination of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union to unite and defend peace, and further strengthened the friendly alliance and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union.

Liu Changsheng's telegram said: "The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions' appeal to trade unions and working people of all countries, published not long ago, correctly pointed out that in order to shatter the criminal plans of US-British aggression, the working class of all countries cannot stand idly by, but should do everything possible. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions fully supports this appeal from the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. At the beginning of the landing of US-British aggressor troops in Lebanon and Jordan, the Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, rose up in protest, demanding that the US troops get out of Lebanon, the British troops get out of Jordan, and that they not interfere in Iraq, and sent telegrams to the trade union organizations of Arab countries to express strong internationalist support. The Chinese workers and people will continue to support the just struggle of the Arab people and all oppressed people with practical actions until they achieve complete victory.

"Our trade union organizations and all workers will strive to further develop the eternal brotherly unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and we believe that our common cause will advance from victory to victory."

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and the All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and the Soviet Youth Organizations Committee on the 6th, congratulating the young men and women of the Soviet Union on the publication of the communiqué of the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in the name of all Chinese youth. The telegram said: "The Chinese youth, educated by the Chinese Communist Party, inspired by this great historical meeting, will, together with the people of the whole country, unite more closely with the great Soviet people and youth, and fight to defend world peace and oppose imperialist aggression. Chinese youth, like Soviet youth, angrily condemn the armed aggression of US-British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan, and the threat of force against the Republic of Iraq, and warmly support the national independence movements of the people and youth of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. For the benefit of all mankind, Chinese youth will contribute all their strength to further strengthening the great unity and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and further strengthening the unity with the peace-loving people and youth of the world."

The All-China Women's Federation sent a telegram to the Soviet Women's Committee on the 6th, saying that all Chinese women warmly support the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union. The telegram said that the unbreakable unity and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is an important guarantee for opposing imperialist aggression and defending world peace, "Chinese women will do everything possible to further develop and strengthen the great friendship between our two peoples; and will resolutely unite closely with the sisters of the Soviet Union, the socialist camp, and all peace-loving sisters in the world to stop aggression and defend peace."

The spokesman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace said in a statement that the communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks fully reflects the common aspirations of the people of China and the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people in the world. The publication of this communiqué is a stern warning and a heavy blow to the US-British imperialist war-mongers, and a great encouragement to the Arab people and all peace-loving people in the world who are fighting against aggression and for the maintenance of national independence. The spokesman pointed out that at present, US-British imperialism is still unwilling to withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East, and continues to send troops to Lebanon, Jordan, and the Middle East, continuing to intensify international tension and threaten world peace. The people of the world must unite, be vigilant at all times and resolutely expose all kinds of aggressive conspiracies of US-British imperialism, and must persist in the struggle until final victory.

Dapu Sheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, said that the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union is a great call for peace in the current era. He said that this communiqué not only clearly expresses the determination of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union to oppose US-British imperialist interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries, but also fully reflects the desire of the people of the world to love peace and oppose war. Dapu Sheng pointed out that Chinese Muslims wholeheartedly support this communiqué. He said: "We Chinese Muslims firmly oppose this aggressive act of US-British imperialism."

    高举和平旗帜坚决反对侵略
    我国各人民团体拥护中苏会谈公报
    据新华社7日讯  我国的各人民团体在今天和昨天分别致电苏联的各有关组织或发表谈话，表示热烈拥护中苏两国领导人的会谈公报。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜今天致电全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申说：“中国人民和全体职工热烈地欢呼和坚决地拥护中苏两国领导人的会谈公报。它对于目前全世界人民保卫和平，反对侵略的斗争，具有伟大的意义和深远的影响。”电报说，毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志这次会谈，再一次地显示了中苏两国八亿人民团结一致保卫和平的坚强意志和伟大决心，并且使中苏两国友好同盟互助关系有了进一步加强。
    刘长胜的电报说：“不久前全苏工会中央理事会发表的致各国工会和劳动人民呼吁书正确地指出：为了粉碎美英侵略的罪恶计划，世界各国工人阶级不能置之不理，而应当作到自己可能作到的一切。中华全国总工会完全支持全苏工会中央理事会这一呼吁。中国工人阶级在美英侵略军队登陆黎巴嫩和约旦之初，即与全国人民一起群起抗议，要求美国军队滚出黎巴嫩，英国军队滚出约旦，不准干涉伊拉克，并且致电阿拉伯各国的工会组织表示了国际主义的有力的支援。中国工人和人民将继续以实际行动支援阿拉伯各国人民和一切被压迫人民的正义斗争，一直到他们获得完全的胜利。
    “我国工会组织和全体职工，将为进一步发展中苏两国人民间的永恒的兄弟团结和友谊而努力，我们相信我们的共同事业将从胜利走向胜利。”
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国青年联合会在6日致电苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会和苏联青年组织委员会，以全中国青年的名义向苏联的青年男女祝贺毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志会谈公报的发表。电报说：“在中国共产党教养下的中国青年，在这次伟大的历史性会谈的鼓舞下，将和全国人民一道，更紧密地和伟大的苏联人民和青年团结在一起，为保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略而斗争。中国青年和苏联青年一样愤怒地谴责美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略，和对伊拉克共和国的武力威胁，热烈支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民和青年的民族独立运动。为了全人类的利益，中国青年将为进一步加强中苏两国的伟大团结和合作，进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，进一步加强同全世界爱好和平的人民和青年的团结而贡献出自己的一切力量。”
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会6日在致苏联妇女委员会的电报中说，全中国妇女热烈拥护中苏两国领导人的会谈公报。电报说，中苏两国人民牢不可破的团结和合作，是反对帝国主义侵略和捍卫世界和平的重要保证，“中国妇女将尽一切力量为进一步发展和加强我们两国人民的伟大友谊而努力；并将坚决地和苏联、社会主义阵营各国的姊妹们以及全世界一切爱好和平的姊妹们紧密地团结起来，制止侵略，捍卫和平。”
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会发言人发表谈话说，中苏会谈公报充分反映了中苏两国人民和世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同愿望。这一公报的发表对美英帝国主义战争贩子是一个严正的警告和沉重的打击，对正在为反对侵略和维护民族独立而斗争的阿拉伯人民和全世界爱好和平人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。发言人指出，目前，美英帝国主义仍不愿从中东地区撤退他们的侵略军队，并且还继续增兵黎巴嫩、约旦和中近东地区，继续加剧国际紧张局势和威胁世界和平。全世界人民必须团结起来，随时警惕和坚决揭穿美英帝国主义的各种侵略阴谋，必须坚持斗争直到最后胜利。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生发表谈话说，中苏两国领袖的会谈公报是当前时代的伟大和平号召。他说，这一公报不仅明确地表达了中苏两国八亿人民反对美英帝国主义干涉阿拉伯各国人民内政的斗争决心，同时也充分反映了全世界人民爱好和平反对战争的愿望。达浦生指出，中国的穆斯林衷心地拥护这个公报。他说：“我们中国穆斯林坚决反对美英帝国主义的这种侵略行为。”
