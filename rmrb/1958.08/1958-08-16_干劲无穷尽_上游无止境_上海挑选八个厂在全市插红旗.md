The Chinese Communist Party's Shanghai Municipal Committee today issued a call through the newspaper, urging comrades on all fronts—industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military—in Shanghai to engage in socialist friendship competitions and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the comprehensive leap forward plan ahead of schedule. The slogan put forward by the Municipal Committee is: Compete in ideology, promote the communist spirit! Compete in style, integrate with the workers and peasants! Compete in wisdom, make great strides in technological and cultural revolutions! Compete in drive, leap forward again and again!

The Municipal Committee's call stated that, after a year of the nationwide rectification movement, under the shining light of the Party's general line for building socialism, unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity have been demonstrated. A vigorous Great Leap Forward situation has formed in the city's industry and on all other fronts. Our existing achievements are far from meeting the needs of the whole country, and the development of our Great Leap Forward is still unbalanced. Some are experiencing a Great Leap Forward, some a medium Leap Forward, and some a small Leap Forward, while others are still in a state of serious backwardness. Even within the more advanced units, development is uneven. The inexhaustible potential of the people on all our fronts has only just begun to be unleashed. People's drive is inexhaustible, advancement is endless, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economically has no limit. The ever-increasing communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act is driving the advanced to move forward even further, and the intermediate and backward to catch up quickly. As long as we continue to improve our communist consciousness, continuously pull out white flags and plant red flags, break superstitions, liberate our minds, and continuously rectify and improve our leadership style and working methods, we will surely be able to continuously leap forward, again and again!

In order to promote the further development of the leap forward situation on all fronts in Shanghai, the Municipal Committee has selected eight advanced factories from among the relatively advanced units: Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, Joint State-Private Tongren Alloy Factory, State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory, Joint State-Private Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, Joint State-Private Dada Motor Manufacturing Factory, and Joint State-Private Daan Machine Factory. It has also appointed some comrades to conduct preliminary summaries of the outstanding experiences of these units and write articles. These articles will be published in Party newspapers and Party publications. Although the experiences of these units are not entirely complete, they each have their strengths and weaknesses, but it is not difficult to see that: the broad masses of these units have been mobilized, their ideological awareness has been greatly improved, and the communist spirit is thriving; the leadership style has also undergone great changes, the relationship between leaders and the masses is relatively good, and some have completely integrated. Precisely because the leadership is closely integrated with the masses, their revolutionary drive is becoming stronger and stronger under various difficult conditions, their research is becoming deeper and deeper, they have broken through various outdated rules and regulations, made great strides in technological and cultural revolutions, relied on their own efforts, cooperated with each other, overcome difficulties, and achieved one victory after another. The Municipal Committee calls on comrades on the industrial front and all other fronts in the city to earnestly learn from these units and all advanced units in the city, to earnestly study the advanced thinking and advanced style of advanced units, to learn their revolutionary drive and revolutionary wisdom, and to catch up with and surpass them!

The Municipal Committee's call was immediately met with enthusiastic response from workers, peasants, and cadres throughout Shanghai. From early morning to noon today, all factories conducted broadcasts and read the newspapers. The workers were full of energy and expressed their determination to learn from advanced factories and catch up with and surpass them.

　　干劲无穷尽　上游无止境
　　上海挑选八个厂在全市插红旗
    本报上海15日电　中共上海市委员会今天通过报纸发出号召，号召上海工农商学兵各条战线上的同志们投入社会主义的友谊竞赛，为提前和超额完成全面跃进计划而斗争。市委提出的口号是：比思想，发扬共产主义精神！比作风，同工农群众打成一片！比智慧，大闹技术革命和文化革命！比干劲，跃进再跃进！
    市委的号召中说，经过一年来的全民整风运动，在党的建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，表现了从来没有见过的积极性和创造性。全市工业和其他各个战线形成了轰轰烈烈的大跃进的局面。我们现有的成就还远远不能满足全国的需要，我们的大跃进发展还是不平衡的，有的是大跃进，有的是中跃进，有的是小跃进，有的还处于严重的落后状态。就是在比较先进的单位内部，发展也是不平衡的。我们各个战线上人民群众中蕴藏着的无穷无尽的潜力，还只是开始发挥出来。人们的干劲是无穷尽的，上游是无止境的，多快好省是没有底的，日益提高的敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，推动着先进的更向前进，中间的和落后的迅速地赶上来。只要我们不断地提高我们的共产主义觉悟，不断地拔白旗、插红旗，破除迷信、解放思想，不断地整顿和改善领导作风和工作方法，就一定能够不断地跃进、再跃进！
    为了促进上海各个战线上的跃进形势进一步发展，市委从现在比较先进的单位中，选择了江南造船厂、上海第一钢铁厂、国营上海第二棉纺织厂、公私合营铜仁合金厂、国营上海第二印染厂、公私合营永鑫无缝钢管厂、公私合营大达电机制造厂、公私合营大安机器厂等八个先进的工厂，并指定一些同志就这些单位比较突出的经验进行了初步总结，写成文章。并且将这批文章在党报、党刊发表。这些单位的经验虽然不是很完备的，他们各有长处，也有缺点，但是，不难看出：这些单位的广大群众已经发动起来，思想觉悟有了很大的提高，共产主义精神蓬蓬勃勃；领导作风也有了很大的改变，领导同群众的关系比较好，有的已经完全打成一片。正因为领导同群众紧密地结合在一起，他们在各种困难的条件下，革命干劲愈鼓愈足，钻研愈钻愈深，冲破了各种陈规旧章，大闹技术革命和文化革命，自力更生，互相协作，克服困难，一个胜利接着一个胜利。市委号召全市工业战线和其他各个战线上的同志们，认真地向这些单位以及全市一切先进单位学习，认真地学习先进单位的先进思想和先进作风，学习他们的革命干劲和革命智慧，赶上和超过他们！
    市委的号召发出后，立即得到全上海工人、农民、干部的热烈响应，今天早晨到中午，各工厂都进行了广播、读报。工人们劲头十足，表示一定要向先进厂学习，赶上和超过他们。
