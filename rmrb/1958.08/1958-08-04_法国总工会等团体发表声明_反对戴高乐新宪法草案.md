Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 2nd: De Gaulle's new draft constitution, aimed at seizing dictatorial power, has met with strong opposition from all strata of French society.

    The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué condemning the anti-democratic essence of the new draft constitution. The communiqué pointed out that this draft constitution completely ignores the economic and social rights guaranteed by the 1946 Constitution; deprives the parliament of all power over economic and social issues, giving the government sole authority. The draft constitution also confirms individual autocracy, thereby facilitating the election of the President of the Republic in violation of democracy. The communiqué also criticized the draft constitution for confirming the annexation of Algeria and refusing the right to self-determination to overseas territories.
    The communiqué of the French General Confederation of Labor concluded: While defending freedom and the Republic, workers will resolutely strive to realize their demands, defend their vested trade union and social rights, and strive to pursue a policy of democracy and peace.
    The Vigilance Committee of Republican Lawyers, uniting more than 300 legal professionals with differing political views, also expressed its opposition to De Gaulle's draft constitution and called on citizens to rise up against it.
    The Union of Democratic Forces also issued a communiqué a few days ago, criticizing De Gaulle for holding a referendum on the draft constitution without prior deliberation and decision by the National Assembly. Holding a referendum in Algeria, where all power is in the hands of the military authorities, would be hypocritical.
    The French Left-Wing Club condemned any constitution that does not base power on universal suffrage but stipulates that the President and Prime Minister share executive power.

    法国总工会等团体发表声明
    反对戴高乐新宪法草案
    新华社巴黎2日电　戴高乐的旨在攫取独裁权力的新宪法草案遭到法国各阶层的强烈反对。
    法国总工会执行局发表公报谴责新宪法草案的反民主实质。公报指出，这个宪法草案完全无视1946年宪法所保证的经济和社会权利；剥夺了议会在经济和社会问题上的一切权力，使政府独揽全权。宪法草案还确认了个人专权，从而有利于在违反民主的情况下选举共和国总统。公报还指责这个宪法草案确认合并阿尔及利亚而拒绝海外领地的自决权。
    法国总工会的公报最后说：工人在维护自由和共和国的同时，将坚决争取实现权利要求，争取保卫既得的工会和社会权利，并且争取奉行民主与和平的政策。
    团结着三百多名政见不同的法律界人士的共和法律界警惕委员会，也表示反对戴高乐的宪法草案，并且号召公民们起来反对它。
    民主力量联盟在几天前也发表一项公报，指责戴高乐要举行的关于宪法草案的全民投票不是经过国民议会事先进行审议决定的。在一切权力都掌握在军事当局手中的情况下，在阿尔及利亚举行全民投票将是虚伪的。
    法国左翼俱乐部谴责不以普选作为权力来源而规定由总统和总理分享行政权的任何宪法。
