　　World's Righteous Public Opinion Halts Hussein's Butcher Knife
    Nadia's Death Sentence Revoked
    Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 21st: Under the strong condemnation of the people of the world, the Jordanian military court was forced today to change the sentence of Nadia Salty, a patriotic Jordanian youth, to seven and a half years in prison, and immediately reduced the sentence to three years.
    At the same time, Hussein's military court, on the trumped-up charge of "conspiracy to subvert the state," sentenced two of the four Jordanian youths tried together to death, and the other two to ten and fifteen years in prison respectively. Among the youths sentenced to death were Nadia's fiancé, Stefan Theodore, and Ahmed Mahmoud Ibrahim, an employee of the Jordanian Ministry of Health.
    These patriotic youths, who opposed the British army's occupation of Jordan, were severely beaten and tortured by Hussein's police during the interrogation process, but they were brave and unyielding. When Ibrahim was escorted to court, his face and arms were covered with wounds from beatings and knife cuts.
    The Hussein authorities in Jordan sentenced these five Jordanian patriotic youths to death a few days ago, which aroused strong protests and opposition from the people and public opinion at home and abroad. The people of the world demanded the revocation of this illegal verdict and their immediate release. However, the Hussein regime still insisted on persecuting these patriotic youths.
    Hussein's military judge announced after this sentencing that the above-mentioned verdicts would only be executed after being approved by Hussein's military governor and Hussein himself.

　　世界正义舆论喝住了侯赛因的屠刀
    纳迪亚死刑已被撤销
    新华社21日讯  安曼消息：在世界人民的强烈指责下，约旦军事法庭今天被迫改判约旦女爱国青年纳迪亚·萨勒提七年半徒刑，并当即减刑为三年徒刑。
    同时，侯赛因军事法庭还以莫须有的“阴谋颠复国家”罪名把一起受审的四名约旦青年中的两名判处死刑，其他两人分别判处十年和十五年徒刑。被判死刑的青年中有纳迪亚的未婚夫斯特凡·西奥多和约旦卫生部的工作人员艾哈迈德·马哈茂德·易卜拉欣。
    这些反对英国军队侵占约旦的爱国青年，在审讯过程中都遭到侯赛因警察的严刑毒打，但是，他们英勇不屈。易卜拉欣在被解到法庭上时，脸上和手臂上满是遭到毒打和刀割的伤痕。
    约旦侯赛因当局几天前判处这五名约旦爱国青年死刑后，曾经引起国内外人民和舆论的强烈抗议和反对。全世界人民都要求撤销这个非法判决，并立即释放他们。但是侯赛因政权仍然坚持迫害这些爱国青年。
    侯赛因的军事法官在这次宣判后宣布说，上述的判决要经侯赛因的军事总督和侯赛因本人批准后才执行。
