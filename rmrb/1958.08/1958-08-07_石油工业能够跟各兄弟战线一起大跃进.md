    The Petroleum Industry Can Leap Forward Together with All Brother Fronts
    Li Renjun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry
    Admitting Backwardness, Unwilling to Lag Behind
    During the First Five-Year Plan, the petroleum industry made significant progress, much better than the "pitiful" state of old China. However, this did not fundamentally change the backward situation. In the country's socialist construction, petroleum is still the weakest link. In 1957, petroleum production was only 1.46 million tons, a figure that is disproportionate to such a large country as ours, which is rapidly building modern industry and agriculture at an unprecedented speed. In the past few years, we have also wanted to develop faster, but because the path was not right and there were not many methods, we always walked like a woman with bound feet, with annual production increasing by only 20% to 27%, no faster. Therefore, people are naturally worried about whether petroleum can keep up. This worry is a great motivating force for us. We admit our backwardness, but we are determined not to be content with lagging behind. We have full confidence in catching up with the pace of industrial and agricultural development. Since the rectification campaign, especially the Double-Anti Movement and the Nanning and Chengdu Conferences, our thinking has been greatly liberated. We have broken through right-leaning conservative thoughts and freed ourselves from the shackles of dogmatism. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line, our eyes have become brighter, our direction has become clearer, and our methods have become more numerous. Now we can loudly answer everyone's concerns: the petroleum industry can leap forward together with all brother fronts. Our goal is to catch up with steel production within fifteen years—one ton of steel for one ton of oil.
    Jumping Out of the Circle of "Running Petroleum Exclusively"
    What is the basis for this? It is the Party's General Line and our country's rich petroleum resources. With the Party's General Line, we can mobilize the enthusiasm of 600 million people and unleash endless power. The combination of this power and abundant petroleum resources can create a huge petroleum industry and achieve rapid development. We are now moving forward along this path.
    The brilliance of the General Line has led us from "running oil exclusively" to facing the whole country, and the petroleum industry has immediately taken on a new look. In the past, the Ministry of Petroleum was deserted, with few visitors; now it is bustling and overwhelmed. Not only are more than 20 provinces and cities actively requesting to run oil, but also cadres from counties, districts, townships, and communes are coming to find us. In the past eight years, we have only restored and expanded six synthetic oil plants, with an annual production capacity of only 730,000 tons. This year, provinces and cities are starting to build nearly 200 synthetic oil plants of various sizes, with an annual production of more than 400,000 tons of tar. In the past, we were ignorant; now we are well-informed. In 1955, when we wanted to engage in coal-to-oil conversion, we only found two or three sources of coal suitable for low-temperature distillation in more than a year. This year, in cooperation with the provinces, we quickly discovered that more than ten provinces have such resources, and the quality is very high.
    Similarly, in the past, we only found three large oil shale mines. This time, in conjunction with the provinces and cities, we discovered many large deposits. In particular, the oil shale mine discovered in Weichang and Fengning counties in Chengde Prefecture, Hebei Province, is estimated to have reserves of tens of billions of tons. The enthusiasm of Party committees and governments at all levels to run oil is also unprecedented. Leading comrades personally take action, organize forces, and act as soon as they speak. For example, when the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee heard experts say that natural gas or oil might be found near Shanghai, the Municipal Party Committee immediately decided to appoint Vice Mayor Niu Shucai as the captain of the exploration team. The Deputy Commissioner of Mudanjiang Prefecture in Heilongjiang Province, upon hearing from the masses that oil was gushing out on Mount Laoye, immediately went to the scene to find it. In Yunnan and Shaanxi, coal and shale pile distillation has already begun production.
    The Petroleum Industry is Full of Vigor
    The General Line and the Rectification Movement have also inspired and promoted all employees of the petroleum industry. Everyone's thinking has leaped forward, the spirit of communism is high, the three winds and five airs of the cadres have been swept away, all the old rules and regulations that hindered the development of production have been broken, and a magnificent production upsurge has been launched. On the front line of natural oil exploration, we are now working with the Ministry of Geology, spreading petroleum exploration teams across more than a dozen basins from the Northwest Plateau to the coastal interior, with large and small drills going up together, and deep and shallow areas being explored together. As a result, the Sichuan oil area was quickly discovered; the Karamay, Qaidam, and Yumen oilfields were continuously expanded; and good signs were found in the Yunnan-Guizhou area, the Songliao Plain, northern Jiangsu, and the Baotou and Yinchuan areas. The national average drilling speed has increased by 50% compared with 1957. Some drilling teams have already reached the level of drilling one thousand meters per month and ten thousand meters per year. This year, it is estimated that 1.4 million meters will be drilled, which is almost equal to the total of the First Five-Year Plan, one year equals five years. On the capital construction front, from design to construction, the investment is reduced by half and the speed is doubled. On the production front, the output value is high every month, and new records are set again and again. The vast number of employees have issued heroic vows that resound through the mountains and rivers, and their enthusiasm is soaring. They said: "One is worth ten, a hundred is worth a thousand, let the British imperialists cry to heaven!" They said: "What is hardship, what is difficulty, there is no barrier we cannot break through!" Good news came from all directions, with tens of thousands of new things.
    The General Line and the Rectification Movement have given us ideological weapons. They have enabled us to break superstitions and dare to think independently. Things that we did not dare to think about in the past, we now dare to think about; things that we did not dare to do in the past, we now dare to do; things that we thought would not be done for a long time, we now realize in a short time. This makes us deeply realize the great significance of politics as the commander and the mass line in running industry. In the past, we talked too little about politics and were busy with technical work, mystifying science and technology, so dogmatism filled the sky. In the exploration of natural petroleum, without taking into account China's specific conditions, we emphasized large drills over small drills, and for several years we have been looking for oil in deep areas. Because we need to drill deep wells, we need large drilling rigs, and the technical conditions are also complicated. Everything must be mechanized, and the equipment and materials could not be manufactured domestically in the past. The investment is large, and the cost of drilling wells is very high, so we cannot do more or do it quickly. This is a path of less, slower, poorer, and more expensive. China's specific conditions are: light drilling rigs can be manufactured in large quantities, petroleum geology is almost a virgin land, and oil layers can be found in both shallow and deep areas. As long as we explore both deep and shallow areas, and explore more shallow oil layers, it will be much easier and faster.
    Simultaneous Development of Natural and Synthetic Petroleum
    In terms of synthetic oil, we saw that foreign countries were running large factories with complex technology and equipment. We did not analyze it and copied it directly, so it was very slow and little.
    Under these circumstances, there was a debate about how to place natural and synthetic petroleum and which should be the main one. Those who advocated focusing on natural petroleum believed that natural oil was cheaper, synthetic oil was technically complex, the investment was large, and the cost was expensive. Even if we do it, we cannot do much, and it will not solve the problem, so they did not agree to do more synthetic oil. Those who advocated doing more synthetic oil believed that although natural oil was cheaper, we have not found much after many years of searching. Although synthetic oil is expensive and technically complex, the resources are more realistic than natural oil. We should do synthetic oil first and slowly do natural oil. Whether advocating doing natural oil or synthetic oil, both have their right side. Both types of oil must be actively pursued. However, because the mind was not liberated, both of these proposals were to do large, modern, and technically complex things. We wanted to do more but could not do more, and we wanted to do it quickly but could not do it quickly. This greatly limited the speed of development of the petroleum industry, and we felt somewhat heavy.
    Liberation of Thought, Relaxed Mood
    With the weapon of the General Line, our thinking became clear. We turned back from the small circle of only wanting large-scale, only wanting modernization, and only wanting exclusive operation. Combining our own situation, we not only thought about large ones, but also thought about medium and small ones; we not only thought about modern ones, but also thought about simple methods; we not only thought about how to do it ourselves, but also thought about how to help the local areas do it. In this way, we figured it out. The masses were very enthusiastic, and the more we thought about the methods, the more there were. In the exploration of natural oil, we removed many unnecessary mechanizations, motorizations, and high standards. We used a large number of light drills, and the exploration team could carry the drilling rig and the oil pot on their backs, and find oil everywhere with light equipment. In this way, not only could we do it, but also the local areas could do it, and it could bloom everywhere. In terms of synthetic oil, according to different resources (bituminous coal, anthracite, oil shale, natural gas), we have now designed more than 20 kinds, with scales ranging from 300 tons, 1,000 tons, 3,000 tons, 10,000 tons to 50,000 tons per year. The minimum investment is only more than 10,000 yuan, and the maximum is 50 million yuan. Provinces, cities, prefectures, counties, townships, and even cooperatives can do it. In particular, oil plants with less than 3,000 tons, the maximum investment is less than 200,000 yuan, and the construction time is only a few months. We have built a synthetic oil plant with an annual output of 300 tons of crude oil at the entrance of the Petroleum Department in 18 days. This small plant is very popular in all aspects, and many provinces have already started to do it. Taking a shale pile distillation plant with an annual output of 1,000 tons as an example, the investment is less than 100,000 yuan, the annual shale requirement is 22,000 tons, and it can be completed in less than three months. The personnel is about 120 to 30, and the required equipment is extremely simple, and local industries can manufacture it. The main product output is 10 tons of gasoline, 40 tons of kerosene, 290 tons of light diesel, 410 tons of heavy diesel, 23 tons of paraffin wax, 50 tons of oil coke, and 130 to 200 tons of ammonium sulfate. The total cost is about 190,000 yuan, and the total output value is more than 270,000 yuan. There are many benefits to running such a factory: it can make full use of various resources, the equipment is simple, the investment is small, the construction is fast, the operation is easy, the investment is recovered quickly, and it can directly serve agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and chemical fertilizer. With these methods, it provides convenient conditions for local areas to set up a large number of small and medium-sized natural oil fields and synthetic oil plants. In turn, it also breaks many superstitions in our original large-scale modern things, which also promotes the progress of large-scale ones. In this way, whether it is natural oil or synthetic oil, it is easy to do, more can be done, and faster. The heavy mood of many years has also been relaxed, and we have truly seen the prospects of the petroleum industry.
    The above many vivid examples eloquently prove the correctness and greatness of the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." It can mobilize people's infinite wisdom and enthusiasm, and it has guided the development of the petroleum industry on a broad road; that is, the simultaneous development of natural oil and synthetic oil; the combination of the central government and local areas; the combination of large, medium, and small sizes; and the combination of modern technology and simple methods. This is a path for the whole party and the whole people to run petroleum. This is a method of walking on two legs, which is naturally much faster than our past method of walking on only one leg of the central government, large-scale, and modernization, and it can also run fast.
    Some people may still be worried, feeling that in doing petroleum, the enthusiasm of "people" is certainly important, but in the end, there must be resources to succeed. So what about our petroleum resources? Our answer is also optimistic.
    Facts Refute the Erroneous Conclusion of "China is Poor in Oil"
    First, let's talk about natural petroleum. The area of sedimentary rocks in our country, according to incomplete surveys, is 2.7 million square kilometers, and sedimentary rock layers of different depths are distributed in all provinces. Therefore, all provinces have the possibility of finding natural oil and gas. However, there are always some people who lack confidence in finding a large amount of natural petroleum. They may be influenced by the old petroleum geological theory. The old petroleum geological theory believes that petroleum is mainly produced in Cenozoic, marine facies, and geosynclinal areas. China does not have many of these strata, so they came to the erroneous conclusion that "China is poor in oil." However, nearly 30 years of practice in countries around the world has proved that this theory is one-sided and incorrect. Petroleum is not only found in Cenozoic, marine facies, and geosynclinal areas, but also in Mesozoic, Paleozoic, continental facies, and platform areas. From the perspective of the new petroleum geological theory, China's geological conditions are not necessarily worse than those of any oil-producing country. Not believing that China has a large amount of petroleum is not only theoretically unfounded, but also our own practice has overthrown this fallacy. The Karamay and Sichuan oilfields were both found in Mesozoic, continental facies, and platform areas. Platform-type oilfields are generally large in area, widely distributed, and the oil layers are relatively stable, and the laws are easy to grasp. The oilfield discovered in Sichuan has these characteristics. The Nanchong, Longnv Temple, and Penglai Town structures all hit the same horizon and gushed out a large amount of crude oil. The Guang'an and Yingshan structures in the vicinity have also recently gushed out oil. After detailed measurement, there are 22 structures in this area, and five have been explored and five have gushed out, which is enough to prove that the oil layers are widely distributed and the oilfield area is very large. The five structures that have already produced oil have a total of nearly 1,000 square kilometers. What is even more gratifying is that the output is also high. The initial test result of Nanchong Well No. 4 showed that it gushed out 200 tons of oil per day, and there is still an upward trend. There are not many such high-yield oil wells in the world. This is a large oil-producing area. In the future, it may produce tens of millions of tons of petroleum per year. At the same time, Sichuan is also a large gas area. According to existing data, the reserves are tens of billions of cubic meters. Like Sichuan, many such areas can be found in our country. Therefore, it can be imagined that with the large-scale development of exploration work, it is entirely possible to find billions of tons of natural petroleum resources in our country.
    Then, let's talk about synthetic petroleum resources. It is well known that China's coal resources are extremely abundant, and there are also many coals with high oil content, up to 46%. Through the comprehensive utilization of coal, we may be able to obtain tens of millions of tons of oil. According to the preliminary estimates we have learned in cooperation with various provinces, the resources of oil shale have reserves of more than 60 billion tons. Except for Jiangsu, Fujian, and Hubei provinces, which have not yet been clarified, all other provinces have them. If all are developed, and mined in 50 years, it can produce 60 million to 80 million tons per year (and can also produce 10 million to 15 million tons of ammonium sulfate as a by-product). These two resources alone can produce hundreds of millions of tons of petroleum. It is very clear that petroleum resources can also enable the petroleum industry to leap forward.
    Of course, on the road ahead, we will encounter new difficulties. However, as long as we closely rely on the Party, rely on the local areas, and rely on the masses, achieve political command, improve leadership, conscientiously implement the Party's General Line for building socialism, follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "break superstitions and liberate thought," dare to act and dare to do, we will certainly be able to overcome any difficulties and build a strong petroleum industry!

    石油工业能够跟各兄弟战线一起大跃进
    石油工业部副部长　李人俊
    承认落后，不甘落后
    第一个五年计划期间，石油工业有了显著的发展，比起旧中国那个“可怜相”好多了。但是这并没有从根本上改变落后面貌，在国家社会主义建设中，石油仍是最薄弱的一环。1957年石油产量只有一百四十六万吨，这个数字与我们这样一个大国，而且又是以世界上史无前例的速度飞快地建设现代工业和农业相比，就太不相称了。以往几年内，我们也很想发展得快一些，但是由于道路走得不对，办法不多，总是像小脚女人走路一样，每年产量增加上20％至27％，再也快不了。因此，人们都很耽心石油能否跟得上，这是很自然的。这种耽心对我们是一种很大的鞭策力量。我们承认落后，但是决不甘心落后，完全有信心随着工农业的发展速度赶上去。从整风运动，特别是双反运动与南宁、成都会议以来，我们的思想获得了大解放，打破了右倾保守思想，从教条主义的束缚中解脱了出来。在党的总路线照耀下，眼睛变亮了，方向明确了，办法也多了，现在可以响亮地回答大家的关切：石油工业能够跟各兄弟战线一起大跃进。我们的目标是：在十五年内赶上钢铁产量——一吨钢一吨油。
    跳出“独家办石油”的圈子
    根据何在呢？这就是党的总路线和我国丰富的石油资源。有了党的总路线就能调动六亿人民的积极性，就能发挥出无穷无尽的力量。这种力量与丰富的石油资源相结合，就能创造巨大的石油工业，就能飞跃发展。我们现在正沿着这条道路前进。
    总路线的光芒使我们从“独家办油”走上了面向全国，石油工业就马上出现了新气象。过去石油部是冷冷清清，少见往来；现在是门庭若市，应接不暇。不仅二十几个省市积极要求办油，而且县区乡社干部也纷纷来找。过去八年我们仅恢复与扩建了六个人造油厂，每年生产能力只有七十三万吨。而今年各省市要动手兴建的大小人造油厂就近二百个，每年生产焦油达四十多万吨。过去我们是孤陋寡闻，现在是四通八达。1955年想搞煤炼油，一年多只找到适合低温干馏的煤炭资源两三处。今年与各省配合搞，很快就发现了十多个省都有这种资源，而且质量还很高。
    同样的，油母页岩过去也只找到了三处大矿，这次一经与省市结合，就发现了许多大的矿藏。特别是在河北承德专区围场、丰宁两县发现的油母页岩矿，估计储量就有几百亿吨。各级党委与政府办油的积极性也是空前的，领导同志亲自动手，组织力量，说干就干。如上海市委听专家们说上海附近可能找到天然气或油，市委马上决定由副市长牛树才同志任勘探大队长。黑龙江省牡丹江专区副专员，听群众说老爷岭上喷出油，就马上亲临现场去找。云南、陕西煤和页岩成堆干馏已经开始生产。
    石油工业气象万千
    总路线与整风运动，也启发与推动了石油工业部门的全体职工。大家的思想跃进，共产主义精神高涨，横扫了干部的三风五气，冲破了一切束缚发展生产的陈规陋矩，掀起了波澜壮阔的生产高潮。在天然油勘探战线上，现在我们和地质部在一起，从西北高原到沿海内地，在十几个盆地上撒开了石油勘探队伍，大钻小钻一齐上，深处浅处一齐探。这样一来，四川油区很快被发现；克拉玛依、柴达木、玉门油田不断扩大；云贵地区、松辽平原、江苏北部和包头、银川地区均发现了好的苗头。钻井速度全国平均比1957年增加50％。有些钻井队已经达到月钻一千、年钻一万的水平。今年预计钻井一百四十万公尺，差不多等于第一个五年的总和，一年顶五年。在基本建设战线上从设计到施工是投资减一半，速度加一倍。在生产战线上是产值月月高，纪录新又新。广大职工发出了气贯山河的豪言壮语，干劲冲天。他们说：“一顶十，百顶千，叫那英帝国主义哭老天！”他们说：“提什么苦，叫什么难，没有我们冲不破的关！”四面八方捷报频传，新气象万万千千。
    总路线和整风运动，给了我们以思想武器。使我们破除了迷信，敢于独立思考。过去不敢想的事情现在敢想了；过去不敢做的事情现在敢做了；过去认为长期办不到的事情，现在短期就实现了。这就使我们深深地体会到，政治是统帅和群众路线办工业的伟大意义。而我们过去正是政治谈的太少，忙于技术业务，把科学技术神秘化起来，于是教条主义满天飞。在天然石油的勘探上，不照顾我国的具体条件，重大钻轻小钻，几年来一味向深处找油。因为要打深井，就需要大钻机，技术条件也复杂，一切都得机械化，设备器材过去国内又造不了，投资大，打井的成本很高，这就不能多搞、快搞。这是一条少慢差费的道路。我国的具体条件是：轻型钻机能大量制造，石油地质几乎是一片处女地，浅处深处都可以找到油层，只要深浅并探，而且多探浅油层，就容易得多，快得多。
    天然石油和人造石油并举
    在人造油方面，看到外国办的都是大厂，技术设备很复杂。我们也没有加以分析，就照样搬过来，结果也就搞得很慢，很少了。
    在这种情况下，曾经为天然石油与人造石油如何摆法，以谁为主的问题发生争论。主张以天然石油为主的人，认为天然油便宜，人造油技术复杂，投资多，成本贵，要搞也搞不了多少，不解决问题，因而不赞成多搞人造油。而主张多搞人造油的人，认为天然油虽便宜，但你找了许多年也没有找到多少，人造油虽贵、技术复杂，但资源比天然油现实，应先搞人造油，慢搞天然油。不论主张搞天然油或人造油都有其对的一面，两种油都必须积极搞。但是由于思想没有解放，这两种主张都是要搞大的、现代化的和技术复杂的，想多搞又不能多搞，想快也快不了，这就大大地限制了石油工业的发展速度，心情有些沉重。
    思想解放，心情舒畅
    我们有了总路线的武器，思想就开朗了。我们从只要大规模、只要现代化、只要独家办的小圈子里回过头来，结合自己的情况，不只想大的，也想中小的；不只想现代化的，也想简易办法的；不只想自己如何办，也想如何帮助地方办。这样就想通了。群众热情很高，办法越想越多。在天然油勘探方面，去掉许多不必要的机械化、汽车化和高标准，大量使用轻便钻，勘探队就能带上钻机，背上油锅，轻装简履，遍地找油。这样不只我们能办，地方也能办，就可以遍地开花。在人造油方面，根据不同资源（烟煤、无烟煤、油母页岩、天然气）现在我们已经设计了二十多种，规模从年产三百吨、一千吨、三千吨、一万吨到五万吨，投资最低只要一万多元，最多到五千万元。省、市、专区、县、乡以至合作社都可以办。特别是三千吨以下的油厂，投资最高不到二十万元，建设时间只几个月。我们已在石油部门口用十八天的时间，建立起一座年产三百吨原油的人造油厂。这种小型厂深受各方面的欢迎，许多省都已动手搞。以一个年产一千吨页岩成堆干馏厂为例，投资在十万元以下，年需页岩二万二千吨，不出三个月就可建成。人员约为一百二、三十个，所需设备极其简单，地方工业都能制造。主要产品产量有汽油十吨，煤油四十吨，轻柴油二百九十吨，重柴油四百一十吨，石腊二十三吨，油焦五十吨，硫铵一百三十至二百吨。总成本约十九万元，总产值约二十七万多元。办这样的厂子好处很多：可以充分利用各种资源，设备简单，投资少，建设快，操作容易，投资收回快，可以直接为农业机械化、水利化和化肥化服务。有了这些办法，就为地方大量开办中小型的天然油田和人造油厂提供了便利条件。反过来也破除了我们原来对大型现代化的东西里面的许多迷信，也就推动了大型的前进。这样一来，无论天然油，人造油都好办了，办多了，办快了。多年沉重的心情也舒畅了，真正看到了石油工业的前景。
    以上许多生动事例，雄辩地证明了党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的正确与伟大，它能调动人们的无限智慧与积极性，它已经为石油工业的发展指引出一条康庄大道；就是天然油与人造油并举；中央与地方相结合；大中小型相结合；现代技术与简易办法相结合。这就是一条全党全民办石油的道路。这是两条腿走路的办法，比我们过去只用中央、大型、现代化一条腿走路的办法，自然就快得多，而且还可以飞跑。
    可能有人还不放心，觉得搞石油，“人”的积极性固然重要，到底还是要有资源才成。那么我们的石油资源究竟如何呢？我们的回答也是乐观的。
    事实驳倒了“中国贫油”的错误结论
    先谈天然石油。我国有沉积岩的面积，据不完全的调查有二百七十万平方公里，各省都有深浅不同的沉积岩层分布。因此各省都有找到天然油、气的可能。但是总有些人对找到大量天然石油的信心不足，他们可能是受旧的石油地质理论的影响。旧的石油地质理论认为石油主要是产在新生代、海相、地槽型地区，这种地层中国的确不多，因而他们就得出了“中国贫油”的错误结论。但是经世界各国近三十年的实践证明，这种理论是片面的，不正确的。石油不只在新生代、海相、地槽地区有，而且中生代、古生代、陆相、地台型地区同样有丰富的石油。从新的石油地质理论来看，我国的地质条件就不见得比那一个盛产石油的国家的地质条件差。不相信中国有大量石油，不但在理论上没有根据，并且我们自己的实践也已推翻了这种谬论。克拉玛依和四川的油田，就都是在中生代、陆相、地台区找到的。地台型的油田，一般的是面积大，分布广，油层比较稳定，规律容易抓到。现在四川发现的油田就有这些特征。南充、龙女寺、蓬莱镇三个构造打到同一层位，都喷出大量原油。附近的广安、营山两个构造最近也喷了油。这一带经过细测的构造有二十二个，探了五个就喷了五个，足以证明油层分布很广，油田面积很大，已经出油的五个构造，合计将近一千平方公里。更可喜的是产量也高，南充四号探井初试结果一天喷油二百吨，还有上升的趋势，世界上这样高产量的油井并不多见。这是一个大的产油区。将来可能年产几千万吨石油。同时四川还是个大气区，根据现有资料储量有几百亿立方公尺。像四川这类地区，在我国还可以找到许多个，因此可以设想，随着勘探工作的大量开展，在我国找到数十亿吨的天然石油资源是完全可能的。
    再谈人造石油资源，我国煤的资源极为丰富是众所周知的，而且含油率高的煤也很多，最高达46％。我们通过煤的综合利用，就有可能拿到几千万吨的油。油母页岩的资源，根据我们与各省配合了解的初步估计，已有六百多亿吨以上的储量。除了江苏、福建、湖北三省还未查清外，其他各省都有。如全部开发，照五十年采完，每年就可以产六千万至八千万吨（还可以副产硫铵一千万吨至一千五百万吨）。单凭这两项资源就能产上亿吨的石油。这就很清楚，石油资源也是能使石油工业大跃进的。
    当然，在前进道路上，还会遇到新的困难。但是，只要我们紧紧地依靠党、依靠地方、依靠群众，做到政治挂帅，改进领导，认真贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线，遵照毛主席“打破迷信，解放思想”的指示，敢作敢为，就一定能够克服任何困难，建设强大的石油工业！
