New Books Commemorating the August 1st Army Day

The People's Literature Publishing House will successively publish "The Glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army," a collection of military documentary prose reflecting the heroic struggles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past thirty years. The entire book will be approximately seven million words and will be divided into four volumes according to the historical periods of the Land Revolution, the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and the post-founding period, with each volume further divided into several collections. To commemorate this year's August 1st Army Day, it will be published in mid-August. The first collection, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire": This collection is divided into two volumes, with a total of more than 120 articles selected. The first volume includes the Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the Guangzhou Uprising, the Jinggang Mountains Struggle, and the Pingjiang Uprising; the second volume includes the Red Fourth Army's advance into southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, as well as armed uprisings and the establishment of the Red Army in areas such as northeastern Jiangxi, western Hunan and Hubei, Honghu, Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Hainan Island, the Left and Right Rivers, and northern Shaanxi. These articles, from various perspectives, reflect the path experienced during the initial establishment of the Red Army, as well as the spirit of hard struggle of the older generation of revolutionary fighters and their noble revolutionary qualities.

To commemorate August 1st, the Popular Literature Publishing House has published six small books reflecting military life. There are collections of correspondence and features, including "Hard Fights Under the Sea" reflecting the new look of the troops, "Seeking a Home" reflecting the close military-civilian relations between border defense soldiers and ethnic minorities, and "Five Warriors on the Snowy Mountain" demonstrating the indomitable will of our border defense troops to defend the motherland; three collections of short stories, which describe the generals going deep into the grassroots and caring for soldiers in "The General in the Barber Shop," write about the touching deeds of demobilized soldiers in "Ode to Heroes on the Yangtze River," and depict the leaping progress of the troops in "Glorious Pace-Setters."
