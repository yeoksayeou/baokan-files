    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 1st. The Ministry of Light Industry and the National Committee of the National Light Industry Trade Union recently jointly held a national on-site meeting of the wine-making industry in Zhengzhou, deciding to utilize potatoes extensively to develop the alcohol industry.

    According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the total planting area of various potatoes across the country this year reached 220 million mu, with an estimated output of at least 700 billion jin. A new problem arising after the bumper harvest of potatoes is how to quickly adopt various methods to address the consumption and processing of potatoes, which have high water content and are not easy to store and transport. The meeting analyzed the current situation of alcohol industrial production in the country and concluded that the production of white spirits in the country is currently excessive, while the supply of industrial alcohol is insufficient. Henan Province's transportation departments alone need 15,000 tons of fuel alcohol this year, and at least 30,000 tons next year; the national demand is even greater. Therefore, this year's large-scale potato harvest provides very good conditions for a great leap forward in the alcohol industry.

    用薯类造酒精
    据新华社郑州1日电　轻工业部和中国轻工业工会全国委员会最近在郑州联合召开全国制酒工业现场会议，决定大量利用薯类发展酒精工业。
    据农业部统计，今年全国各种薯类种植面积达二亿二千万亩，预计产量至少能达到七千亿斤。在薯类丰产以后出现的新问题是：如何迅速采取各种办法来解决含水分多、不易保管运输的薯类消费和加工。会议分析了今年全国酒精工业生产的形势，认为目前全国白酒工业生产过剩，而工业上用的酒精却供应不足，仅河南省交通运输部门今年就需要燃料酒精一万五千吨，明年至少要三万吨；全国需要量更大。因此，今年全国薯类大丰收给酒精工业的大跃进提供了非常好的条件。
