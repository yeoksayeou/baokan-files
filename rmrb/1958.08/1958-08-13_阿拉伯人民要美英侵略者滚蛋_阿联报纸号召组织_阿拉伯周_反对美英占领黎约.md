Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 11th – Cairo newspapers today published editorials demanding that the United Nations General Assembly order the withdrawal of American and British occupation forces from Lebanon and Jordan, and condemning American and British acts of aggression in the Middle East.

"Al-Ahram" said that if the United Nations General Assembly truly hopes to maintain peace in the Middle East, "it should immediately pass a resolution demanding that American troops withdraw from Lebanon and British troops withdraw from Jordan. Such a decision should be made without delay and without quibbling, so that the Middle East region can restore security, and the demon of war threatening the Middle East and the entire world can be driven away."

The newspaper said that the United Nations General Assembly should condemn those countries that caused the Middle East crisis and tension, and should demand that they not interfere in this part of the world.

Commenting on Hammarskjöld's plan to resolve the Middle East issue, "Al Shaab" said, "If the United Nations does not accuse the United States and Britain of being aggressors, and does not recognize that imperialist interference in the Middle East is the cause of all disputes, there is no hope for peace and stability."

The newspaper pointed out to the United Nations that all economic and technical assistance would be futile if the imperialist countries do not abandon their attempts to dominate this part of the world.

The newspaper said, "Eisenhower's recognition of the existence of Arab nationalism should not give us a false sense of security." It said that imperialism is continuing its military preparations unabated.

The newspaper also warned that there are signs that the purpose of the new plans and conspiracies is not only to cover up the crimes of armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, but also to achieve new goals of American and British aggression.

"Al-Gomhuria" reminded the United Nations General Assembly to remember the lessons of past failures. It said that its work in resolving the Middle East issue will only succeed if it can be accepted by the people of the Middle Eastern countries.

Cairo Radio stated on the 10th its opposition to discussing any so-called plans to guarantee political and economic stability in the Middle East at the emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, if the freedom and self-determination rights of the Arab people are not recognized.

The radio commentator said that if the people of the Middle Eastern countries cannot enjoy complete and absolute freedom to formulate their own policies according to their national aspirations, and if they cannot fully enjoy their right to self-determination, then we cannot see how political and economic stability in the Middle East can be guaranteed.

The commentator continued, what we know is that there is currently military aggression against the Arab people, and behind this aggression are armed forces that have not been disarmed and are stepping up their preparations. Apart from this, all talk about the Middle East crisis is only to divert people's attention from the reality.

Xinhua News Agency, August 12th – TASS Cairo, August 11th: A mass rally was held in Alexandria on the 10th. The participants in the rally unanimously angrily condemned the crimes of American and British aggression against the Arab people, and demanded that the United Nations order the United States to immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon, and the United Kingdom to immediately withdraw its troops from Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 11th – "Al Nour" published an editorial on the 11th, calling for the organization of an "Arab Week" to carry out the struggle against the American and British occupation of Lebanon and Jordan.

The newspaper said that when the United Nations General Assembly is holding its meeting, it is required that the various organizations here cooperate and unite in this serious stage, hold mass rallies, and mobilize all the potential of the people, in order to achieve the great and fundamental goal of making the United States and Britain withdraw their occupation forces. The people of the whole country should arm themselves with awareness and vigilance, unite strongly, and fully realize this goal.

    阿拉伯人民要美英侵略者滚蛋
　　阿联报纸号召组织“阿拉伯周”反对美英占领黎约
    新华社开罗11日电　开罗报纸今天发表社论要求联合国大会责成美英占领军撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，并且谴责美英在中东的侵略行为。
    “金字塔报”说，如果联合国大会真正希望维护中东和平，“它就应该立即通过决议，要求美国军队撤出黎巴嫩和英国军队撤出约旦。应该毫不拖延地和毫不扯皮地作出这样一个决定，以便中东地区可以恢复安全，威胁中东和整个世界的战争恶魔可以被赶走。”
    这家报纸说，联合国大会应该谴责这些引起中东危机和紧张局势的国家，并且应该要求它们不要干涉世界的这一部分。
      “人民报”在评论哈马舍尔德的解决中东问题的计划时说，“如果联合国不指责美国和英国为侵略者，并且不承认帝国主义在中东的干涉是一切纠纷的原因的话，和平和稳定就没有希望。”
    这家报纸向联合国指出，如果帝国主义国家不放弃统治世界这一部分的企图的话，一切经济和技术援助都将是徒劳的。
    报纸说，“艾森豪威尔承认存在阿拉伯民族主义这件事，不应该使我们产生虚假的安全感。”它说，帝国主义还在毫不减弱地继续进行军事准备。
    这家报纸还警告说，有迹象表明：新计划和阴谋的目的不仅在于掩饰武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的罪行，还在于达到美英侵略的新目标。
    “共和国报”提醒联合国大会记取过去失败的教训。它说，它在解决中东问题方面的工作只有在能为中东各国人民接受的情况下才会获得成功。
    开罗电台10日表示反对在联合国大会紧急会议上讨论任何所谓保证中东政治经济稳定的计划，要是阿拉伯各国人民的自由和自决权利不被承认的话。
    电台评论员说，如果中东各国人民不能享有根据他们的民族愿望来拟订自己的政策的完全的绝对自由，如果他们不能充分享有他们的自决权，那么，我们就看不出如何能保证中东政治和经济方面的稳定。
    评论员接着说，我们所知道的，就是目前存在着对阿拉伯人民的军事侵略，在这种侵略的背后有着没有解除武装的正在加强准备的军队。除此而外，一切有关中东危机的言论，都只能是为了转移人们对现实情况的注意。
    据新华社12日讯　塔斯社开罗11日讯：亚历山大港10日举行了人山人海的群众大会。大会参加者一致愤怒地痛斥美英侵略阿拉伯各国人民的罪行，并且要求联合国责成美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩，英国军队立即撤出约旦。
    据新华社大马士革11日电　“光明报”11日发表社论，号召组织一个“阿拉伯周”来进行反对美英两国占领黎巴嫩和约旦的斗争。
    这家报纸说，在联合国大会举行会议的时候，要求这里的各个组织在这个严重的阶段进行合作和团结，举行群众大会，动员人民的一切潜力，以便达到使美英两国撤退占领军的这个伟大的基本目标。全国人民应该以觉悟和警惕武装起来，坚强地团结一致，全力实现这个目的。
