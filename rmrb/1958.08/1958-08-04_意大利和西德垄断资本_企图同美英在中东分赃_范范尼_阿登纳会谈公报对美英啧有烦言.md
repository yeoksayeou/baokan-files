Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Bonn - After concluding his talks with British Prime Minister Macmillan, Italian Prime Minister Fanfani arrived in Bonn on the 2nd from London for a one-day meeting with West German Chancellor Adenauer and Foreign Minister Brentano.

As can be seen from the communiqué, West Germany and Italy harbor discontent towards the US and Britain, consistently complaining that these two countries did not consult with them before taking armed intervention actions in the Middle East. The communiqué emphasizes "consultation" and demands that Western allies more fully inform them in the future when taking actions related to world peace issues. The communiqué also particularly emphasized the "identity of interests" between West Germany and Italy.

According to Western news agencies, the main purpose of Fanfani's visit to Bonn was to gain Adenauer's support for his proposal on politically and economically "appeasing the Middle East." This plan advocates using economic "aid" to Middle Eastern countries to achieve the goal of politically suppressing the tide of national liberation movements in the region. The Italian rulers are calculating that, in doing so, Italian monopoly capital, which has so far been squeezed out by US and British monopoly capital in the Middle East, will be able to take the opportunity to step in and share the oil profits of the Middle East.

Fanfani mentioned this plan when he visited Washington a few days ago, but was met with indifference. However, in Bonn this time, Fanfani's plan was reportedly welcomed by West German monopoly capitalists who have the same intentions. However, West German monopoly capitalists advocate "guaranteeing" their investments through an international organization. They are worried that direct investment in areas where national movements are surging may face risks.

The Bonn "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin" revealed on the 2nd, commenting on the Fanfani-Adenauer talks, that the attitude of the two countries towards France was also one of the topics of the meeting. It is said that West Germany and Italy are dissatisfied with France's attempt to regard itself as the "spokesperson of Western Europe." The "Westphalian Review" revealed that the planned Middle East plan of Italy and West Germany has "caused unease in Paris." (Attached picture)

### 意大利和西德垄断资本  企图同美英在中东分赃  范范尼——阿登纳会谈公报对美英啧有烦言

    意大利和西德垄断资本
    企图同美英在中东分赃
    范范尼——阿登纳会谈公报对美英啧有烦言
    据新华社3日讯　波恩消息：意大利总理范范尼在结束了他同英国首相麦克米伦的会谈以后，2日由伦敦到达波恩，同西德总理阿登纳和外交部长勃伦塔诺举行了为期一天的会谈。
    从公报中可以看出，西德和意大利对于美英两国心怀不满，它们一直在抱怨这两个国家在对中东采取武装干涉行动之前，没有同它们磋商。公报强调“磋商”，并且要求西方盟国今后在采取关系到世界和平问题的行动时，更充分地把情况通知他们。公报还特别强调了西德和意大利两国的“利益一致”。
    据西方通讯社透露，范范尼这次访问波恩，最主要的目的是要争取阿登纳支持他所提出的关于在政治和经济上“绥靖中东”的方案。这个方案主张通过对中东国家的经济“援助”来达到在政治上抑制这个地区的民族解放运动浪潮的目的。意大利的统治者盘算，在这样做的时候，到现在为止一直在中东地区受到美英垄断资本排挤的意大利垄断资本，就能够乘机插进去，分享中东的石油利润。
    范范尼在几天前访问华盛顿的时候，曾经提过他这个计划，但是遭到了冷淡。而这一次在波恩，范范尼的计划据说却受到了有同样打算的西德垄断资本家的欢迎。不过，西德垄断资本家主张通过一个国际性机构来“保障”他们的投资。他们担心，在民族运动风起云涌的地区直接投资可能遭到风险。
    波恩“议会政治新闻公报”2日在评论范范尼—阿登纳会谈时透露，两国对法国的态度也是会谈的主题之一。据说，西德和意大利对法国企图以“西欧大陆的代言人”自居感到不服气。而“威斯特伐利亚评论报”则透露，意大利和西德筹划中的有关中东的方案已经“引起了巴黎的不安”。（附图片）
