At this moment, thunderous applause and cheers erupted from the ranks of the welcoming crowd, and a group of young women ran forward to present flowers to Prince Sihanouk and the distinguished guests.

Yu Yichuan delivered a welcoming speech at the airport, saying: "In recent years, the traditional friendly relations between the peoples of China and Cambodia have witnessed encouraging development.

Prime Minister Sihanouk then addressed the welcoming crowd, saying that he was very pleased to be visiting "fraternal and peaceful China" again. He said that China's friendship with Cambodia has always been consistent, and the relations between the two countries over the past two years have led to the exchange of ambassadors today.
