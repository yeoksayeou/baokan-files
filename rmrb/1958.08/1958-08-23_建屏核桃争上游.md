Jianping Walnuts Compete to Be the Best
    Tian Baoyuan
    The walnut trees are densely layered,
    It would take three days and nights to count them all,
    In previous years, one cluster had two or three,
    This year, one cluster has more than ten.
    The tall trees are bent over with the weight,
    The low trees are sitting on the ground.
    Why are there so many walnuts this year?
    Because they want to compete to be the best.

　　建屏核桃争上游
    田宝元
    核桃树密层层，
    三天三夜数不清，
    往年一簇两三个，
    今年一簇十个多。
    压得高树弯了腰，
    压得低树地上坐。
    今年核桃为啥这样稠？
    因为它要争上游。
