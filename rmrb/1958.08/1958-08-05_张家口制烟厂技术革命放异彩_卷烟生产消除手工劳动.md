Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory's Technical Revolution Shines
Cigarette Production Eliminates Manual Labor

(Our Dispatch) The Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory has launched a vigorous technical revolution, eliminating manual labor from cigarette production.

The Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory's equipment was relatively backward. In the past, moving from one process to another required heavy manual labor. During the technical innovation movement, all factory workers studied and transformed the processes together. In a short period of time, they connected processes such as flavoring, shredding, roasting, cigarette making, and packaging with conveyor belts, and linked cigarette machines, packaging machines, sealing machines, and labeling machines for continuous production. This eliminated manual labor and shortened the production process.

This reform reduced the labor intensity of workers and improved production efficiency. The time from raw materials to finished products was reduced from six days to four days, and more than 300 workers were saved, freeing up more than 900 square meters of factory space. This provides the conditions for one factory to become two, allowing for the establishment of another flax mill.

    张家口制烟厂技术革命放异彩
    卷烟生产消除手工劳动
    本报讯　张家口市制烟厂大闹技术革命，使卷烟生产取消了手工劳动。
    张家口市制烟厂设备比较落后。过去，从一个工序到另一个工序，都要采用笨重的手工劳动。在技术革新运动中，全厂职工边研究边改造，很短的时间，他们就把加香、切丝、烤丝、卷烟、包烟等工序用传送带联结起来，并且把卷烟机、包装机、封包机、贴花机连起来生产。取消了手工劳动，缩短了工艺过程。
    这一改革，减轻了工人的劳动强度，提高了生产效率，从原料到制出成品由六天减到四天，并且节省出三百多人，腾出九百多平方公尺的厂房。这就提供了一厂变两厂的条件，可以另外办一个亚麻厂。
