Chairman Mao in Tianjin

From August 10th to 13th, Chairman Mao inspected Tianjin. This was a moment of happiness that the people of the city will never forget.

With Agricultural Cooperative Members

At a little after 4:00 PM on the 10th, Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Governor of Hebei Province, Li Gengtao, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Secretariat and Mayor of Tianjin, and others accompanied Chairman Mao to the Xinli Village Agricultural Cooperative in Sihezhuang Township, Eastern Suburbs District. Meng Fanxing, Deputy Secretary of the Township General Branch, Xu Shuqing, Director of the Cooperative, Wang Xingyuan, Secretary of the Cooperative Branch, and others went out of the village to meet Chairman Mao. Everyone stared in rapt attention for a long while, calling out in unison, "Chairman Mao!" In an instant, Chairman Mao had approached them, shaking their hands warmly. They never expected that Chairman Mao would come to their cooperative. Excitedly, they gripped Chairman Mao's hand tightly, saying repeatedly, "Hello, Chairman Mao!" "Hello, Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao walked slowly along a path shaded by green trees beside a rice paddy. Streams of gurgling water were diverted into the green rice fields beside the road; the rice, just beginning to spike and blossom, exuded a refreshing fragrance. Chairman Mao walked serenely over a small bridge over the stream and came to the edge of the rice paddy. Seeing a red flag planted on the ridge with the words "Upstream" written on it, he asked Zhang Fu'an, the District Head of the Eastern Suburbs District who was in charge of this key project in the cooperative: "What does 'Upstream' mean?" Zhang Fu'an said: "In the rice paddy management, the cooperative conducts evaluations of each team every ten days. After the evaluation, Class A seedlings are marked with 'Upstream' flags, Class B seedlings with 'Midstream' flags, and Class C seedlings with 'Downstream' flags, to encourage the Class B and C seedlings to catch up with Class A."

"If it's 'Downstream,' how do you catch up? Can you catch up?" Chairman Mao asked with concern.

Zhang Fu'an replied: "Yes, we can. As long as we apply more fertilizer and strengthen management, we can catch up." He pointed to the rice paddy with the "Upstream" flag and said, "This land was originally midstream. The cooperative members put more effort into management and managed to reach 'Upstream' in half a month." Chairman Mao listened, smiled, and nodded in satisfaction.

Chairman Mao walked along the edge of the rice paddy. He saw that the wall behind cooperative member Zhao Yihe's house was covered with a big-character poster from the Fifth Production Team striving for first place in the entire district, so he went over and looked at it carefully. Chairman Mao was very interested in the production measures written on the big-character poster for the team's efforts to strive for first place. Then he walked into the Fifth Team's rice paddy. He turned to ask Zeng Guodong, Secretary of the Eastern Suburbs District Party Committee:

"How many seedlings are there per mu in this rice paddy?"

Zeng Guodong said: "This rice paddy covers more than 300 mu, with an average of more than 20,000 seedlings per mu, each seedling having twenty-seven or eight shoots." Chairman Mao squatted in the field, separating the rice shoots with his hands to observe the growth of the rice.

Chairman Mao turned back to ask everyone, "Is this rice paddy all like this?" The township and cooperative cadres replied, "It's all like this!" Chairman was very satisfied when he heard it. Chairman Mao stood up, and Meng Fanxing, Deputy Secretary of the Township General Branch, said: "Chairman, there's also a good rice paddy inside with densely planted with more than 22,000 seedlings!" Chairman Mao smiled and said: "Okay, let's go and take a look."

By the time Chairman Mao finished looking at these rice paddies, the setting sun was still scorching hot. As Chairman Mao walked back, he was energetic and showed no signs of fatigue. On the way, Chairman Mao, like an ordinary cooperative cadre concerned about cooperative affairs, asked Zhang Fu'an and Meng Fanxing: How many households are there in the Fifth Team? How much labor force? What was the cooperative's rice yield last year and what is the planned yield this year? How much fertilizer is used per mu of rice paddy per year? Zhang Fu'an and Meng Fanxing answered one by one.

At this time, the news of Chairman Mao's arrival had spread throughout the village. Men and women, old and young, gathered from all directions and stood by the Fifth Team's rice paddy, shouting, "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Old man Cao Zhenhai, who was over eighty years old, also came from his distant residence along a small path in the field. Stroking his white beard, he shielded his eyes with his hand, looking for Chairman Mao. When he found Chairman Mao, he put down his crutches and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "May Chairman Mao be healthy!" Chairman Mao took off his straw hat and waved to the welcoming crowd and the gray-haired old man.

Wherever Chairman Mao went, there was a cheering, boiling crowd. Chairman Mao came to the cooperative's experimental team. The cooperative members who were working in the rice paddy stopped their work, and women and children also came out of the houses by the field: "Long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers of "Long live the Communist Party!" echoed in the fields. Chairman Mao's face was filled with a kind and amiable smile as he shook hands with the cooperative cadres and members of the experimental team one by one. Young female cooperative member Wu Zhenlan shook Chairman Mao's hand excitedly and said, "Hello, Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao said, "Hello to you!"

Chairman Mao walked to the edge of the reed field, and District Head Zhang Fu'an pointed to the reed field and said to Chairman Mao: "We want to hybridize rice and reeds, so that in the future they can grow rice ears and reed stalks. They will be drought-resistant and flood-resistant, and can be harvested once a year without weeding or fertilizing." Chairman Mao listened and praised their spirit of daring to think and dare to do.

Chairman Mao asked with concern: "Have you done any experiments now?"

Zhang Fu'an replied: "Not yet."

Chairman Mao said: "Do these two things belong to the same category? You can try it." Zhang Fu'an said: "Chairman Mao, we must try it."

After Chairman Mao came to the experimental field with a planned yield of 50,000 jin of rice per mu, he asked production team leader Zhang Enlin: "How many jin per mu is this rice field planned to yield?" Zhang Enlin said: "It is planned to yield 50,000 jin per mu." Chairman Mao praised: "The rice is growing very well!" Zhang Fu'an told Chairman Mao that this rice field was narrow, and wooden boards could be built on the ridges on both sides for transplanting and field management, so that cooperative members did not have to go into the water to work, and the ventilation and sunlight were good, and the leaves did not turn yellow. Chairman Mao was very interested when he heard this. He pointed to the large rice paddies in the distance and said: "Can you make it like that there? People don't have to go into the water to work." Zhang Fu'an said: "We can do it." After Chairman Mao visited the experimental field, he walked to the edge of the reed field again. Chairman Mao told Zhang Fu'an: "You must try the hybridization of rice and reeds!" Zhang Fu'an said: "Okay! We will definitely experiment well."

The sun was setting, and Chairman Mao was about to leave. People who had heard that Chairman Mao was coming ran along the ridges and along the streams to the experimental field next to the Jin (Tianjin)-Tang (Tanggu) highway. The sides from the edge of the experimental field to the highway bridge were crowded with people. People shouted, "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao sometimes raised his hand to salute and sometimes shook hands with the cooperative members in a modest manner.

Just as he was about to get into the car, the cheering crowd surrounded Chairman Mao again. Chairman Mao shook hands with the masses one by one. It was not until Chairman Mao got into the car and left for a long time that some people reluctantly left the place where Chairman Mao had stayed.

At the Technical Revolution Exhibition Hall

On August 12th, Chairman Mao visited the Tianjin Industrial Technical Revolution Exhibition, which was about to open. The city's workers felt infinitely encouraged by Chairman Mao's concern for their labor. At 8:00 PM, Chairman Mao, accompanied by Hebei Province Governor Liu Zihou, Tianjin Mayor Li Gengtao, and other comrades, came to the exhibition. Chairman Mao got out of the car and walked steadily up the steps leading to the hall, smiling and shaking hands with the welcoming people, radiating vitality and strength. People couldn't help but feel happy for Chairman Mao's health from the bottom of their hearts.

Chairman Mao passed through the brightly lit hall and first came to the "East Wind Pavilion." The hundreds of products on display in this pavilion were all produced by workers under the brilliant light of the General Line, who dared to think and dare to do in the Great Leap Forward, striving to be upstream and catch up with or surpass the world's advanced levels. Chairman Mao visited the hot-rolled gears of the Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant. Factory Director Liu Shuying told Chairman Mao that this was a method of heating the gear blanks with high-frequency electricity and then directly rolling them into gears with a machine. Using this method, efficiency is increased by 10 to 50 times compared to machining with machine tools, and the machining allowance is small, which can save 25% of steel. Chairman Mao came to the exhibition stand displaying domestically produced silica gel, where 21-year-old young worker Sun Shougang greeted Chairman Mao. When Chairman Mao learned that he was the worker who had successfully developed silica gel, he shook hands with him kindly. Chairman Mao leaned over the exhibition stand and carefully looked at the silica gel samples from various countries and the quality comparison table. The acid absorption capacity of British silica gel was only 29%, the acid absorption capacity of Japanese silica gel was 46%, while the acid absorption capacity of our self-made silica gel reached 61%. Chairman Mao praised it as good. Many products in this pavilion that had caught up with or surpassed the world's advanced level attracted Chairman Mao's attention. He carefully watched the shuttleless loom, electric spark machine tool, and seven-head winding machine for several minutes. When he saw a chart that read: "Cylinder quality exceeds that of Britain," Chairman Mao smiled and said to the people: "Cylinders are also catching up?" The narrator introduced to Chairman Mao: "Our cylinders can pump up to 250 pounds of pressure, while the American ones can only pump up to 150 pounds." Mayor Li Gengtao then said, "Our air is going to be pumped up much better than theirs." This double-entendre made Chairman Mao and the workers laugh.

In the Heavy Industry and Electromechanical Industry Pavilion, staff introduced Chairman Mao to the situation of using converters to smelt silicon steel. In the past, some engineering technicians believed that only electric furnaces could smelt silicon steel, but after the Great Leap Forward, workers dared to think and dare to do, and used converters to smelt high-quality silicon steel, shortening the smelting time by 80% and reducing costs by one-third. Then, Chairman Mao saw the silicon steel sheets rolled by Tianjin using indigenous methods and happily said, "You can all manufacture them." Chairman Mao was very satisfied with the various creations of the workers in improving technology, using substitutes, and saving raw materials. The single-strand barbed wire made by the Xinya Electrical Appliance Repair Plant saved 40% of lead wire compared to the previous double-strand barbed wire. The Tianjin Forging Machine Tool Plant adopted the processing method of using a broaching knife to hollow out complete steel materials that can be used to make small parts from the processed large parts. Chairman Mao carefully looked at these products and inquired about the operation.

During the break, Chairman Mao also inquired with concern about the new situations that have emerged in Tianjin's industrial Great Leap Forward. When Mayor Li Gengtao said that the current main problem was the insufficient supply of raw materials, Chairman Mao instructed: "Localities should find ways to establish independent industrial systems. First is the collaborative zone, then many provinces. As long as there are conditions, relatively independent but different industrial systems should be established. How are you doing?" Governor Liu Zihou replied at the time that they were now starting to work towards independence and would be able to establish it in three to five years. Chairman Mao was very concerned about when the local industrial base of the special zones and counties could be established. Zhao Ke, First Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee, who accompanied Chairman Mao on the inspection, reported on the situation of non-mountainous areas organizing the masses to go to other areas to go up the mountains to mine and engage in large-scale steel production, which Chairman Mao praised. He said: "One is grain, and the other is steel. With these two things, everything will be easy to handle." Chairman Mao was also very concerned about Tianjin's work in manufacturing large equipment and instructed that it should be grasped tightly and installed and used as soon as possible. When he heard the news that the repair workers of several power plants in Tianjin were manufacturing generators, he said that this method was very good. Why can power plants only generate electricity and not manufacture generators? It can be expanded a bit, and some workers can be fixed to become workshops attached to the power plant.

Chairman Mao then successively visited the Chemical Industry, Textile, Handicraft, and Light Industry Pavilions. The staff of the exhibition pointed to several black pipes of different thicknesses and told Chairman Mao: "These are made of polyvinyl chloride." Chairman Mao walked up, picked up the thick pipe to look at it, and then picked up the thin pipe to look at it, asking, "Can this replace steel?" The staff said, "Yes, it can." Chairman Mao nodded in satisfaction. The products of the Textile, Light Industry, and Handicraft Pavilions were colorful and eye-catching. Chairman Mao watched silk fabrics as thin as cicada wings, brightly colored printed fabrics, various blankets and woolens, radios, musical instruments, etc. After Chairman Mao inquired about the quality of cotton yarn, he stopped in front of a glass picture board with the words "Increase Vehicle Speed" written on it. The staff told Chairman Mao: "The machines that spin 23-count warp yarns are running at 462 revolutions per minute in the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory, but the highest in Tianjin is only 300 revolutions per minute; the machines that spin 21-count weft yarns are running at 320 revolutions per minute in Shijiazhuang, but the highest in Tianjin is only 281 revolutions per minute. We are now learning from our worker brothers in Shijiazhuang and striving to catch up with and surpass them." Chairman Mao encouraged everyone: "Strive to be upstream." Chairman Mao walked along the commodity counter, and a young man ran up to shake hands with Chairman Mao enthusiastically. Someone told Chairman Mao: "This is Liang Shukai, a young technician who is researching dyeing silk without dyes." Chairman Mao asked him with concern: "Where is your invention?" Liang Shukai led Chairman Mao to the side of the wall with silks of pink, light yellow, and brown hanging on it, and said, "This is dyed without dyes." Then, he told Chairman Mao: "There are even better colors, but they haven't been brought to the exhibition. We are going to send them to Beijing to pay tribute to Chairman Mao." Chairman Mao said, "Thank you." Then, Chairman Mao talked to him cordially and asked him where he was from and what school he had gone to. Liang Shukai answered one by one. Chairman Mao smiled and stretched out his hand again, and Liang Shukai shook it tightly.

It was 11 o'clock at night. Chairman Mao had visited the exhibition hall for nearly three hours, and his spirit was as good as when he arrived. When leaving the exhibition hall, Chairman Mao shook hands with the workers one by one. The staff of the exhibition gathered around Chairman Mao's car, bidding farewell to Chairman Mao with a reluctant mood.

Visiting Factories Run by Schools

The news that Chairman Mao came to Tianjin University for inspection quickly spread throughout this new type of Chinese university with an area of more than 200,000 square meters and more than 9,000 teachers, students and staff. At 11:05 AM on the 13th, several cars slowly drove into the gate of Tianjin University and stopped in front of the office building. Some students and teachers in various classrooms and dormitories ran towards the office building from all directions. Chairman Mao got out of the car and, accompanied by Hebei Province Governor Liu Zihou, Tianjin Mayor Li Gengtao, and Comrade Wang Kangzhi, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, walked into the office of the Tianjin University Party Committee. Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University, and Jia Zhen, Secretary of the Party Committee, welcomed Chairman Mao. Then, a cordial conversation began.

President Zhang Guofan reported the school's situation to Chairman Mao. President Zhang said: "98% of the students in this school have participated in work-study programs, and we are also preparing to run several work-study classes next semester." Chairman Mao said: "That's very good. Originally, just reading books, without doing it yourself, some haven't even seen it, so when you use it, you can't make products. By doing work-study programs, you have knowledge and you are also a laborer." Chairman Mao also said: "Some middle schools in Changge County, Henan Province, have done a good job in work-study programs. The students are making rapid progress and going to higher schools. Some middle schools have not done work-study programs, so it is not good. The students are going to higher schools less, and they cannot pass the exams. Their knowledge is not good. They only read books and have not learned them, and they have damaged their brains." Chairman Mao asked Comrade Wang Kangzhi whether Tianjin middle schools had work-study programs. Comrade Wang Kangzhi replied that nearly 100 middle schools in Tianjin had started work-study programs. More than 60 middle schools have also established factories or production workshops. Chairman Mao said: "Good! Schools are factories, factories are also schools, and agricultural cooperatives are also schools. They must be run well."

Chairman Mao was very interested in the fact that Tianjin University had set up many factories in a short period of time. Chairman Mao said: "Some teachers must also make progress. The situation is forcing them to make progress. They just need to move their hands. Teachers over 50 years old can stop moving their hands. Young and middle-aged people must move their hands. People who do scientific research should also move their hands, otherwise it is not good to never move their hands in their lives." President Zhang Guofan reported: "Now the students are very enthusiastic about technical revolution. Some are rushing day and night to pay tribute to National Day, and they cannot be persuaded." Chairman Mao said with concern: "Does working all night make people thin? We should still pay attention to rhythmic production, rhythmic rest and labor." The president and Party committee secretary said that they would convey Chairman Mao's concern to the students.

At nearly 12 o'clock, Chairman Mao arrived at the platform outside the door. At this time, students who were expecting to meet Chairman Mao shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" Chairman Mao clapped his hands with everyone and walked from east to west, back and forth several times. Then he went to visit several factories run by the school.

Chairman Mao walked into the machine factory set up by the school in the cheers of the crowd. More than 100 lathes were rumbling, and smiles appeared on the faces of many people. Many eyes were watching the person people were eager to see. Everyone hoped that Chairman Mao would come to their machine. Chairman Mao walked slowly, almost to every machine tool. Zhang Meizhen, a female student in the second grade of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, could no longer calm down after Chairman Mao entered the door. The closer Chairman Mao got, the clearer she saw him, and the faster her heart beat. She had a lot to say to her most beloved leader. When Chairman Mao stopped next to her lathe, she was so excited that she couldn't say a word. Chairman Mao spoke first, asking her: "What level of worker can you reach now?" "Is work-study good?"... Seeing that Chairman Mao was so approachable, so patient and kind, her heart no longer beat so fast, and she answered calmly one by one. Chairman Mao walked in front of a large lathe. A second-year student named Chen Jingdou was turning a larger round part, and iron filings were flying. This classmate raised his arms to block the flying iron filings so that they would not hit Chairman Mao. A short female student named Wang Hongyu, with her hands full of oil stains, was doing her best. Chairman Mao came to her, and after carefully watching her operation, he wanted to shake hands with her. She said excitedly: "My hands are full of oil!" She didn't dare to stretch them out, for fear of getting Chairman Mao's hands dirty. Chairman Mao still shook her hand tightly.

Chairman Mao successively visited the machine factory and the foundry. After a break, he took a car to a place one kilometer away and watched the sulfuric acid plant that the students were building themselves. At 1:10 PM, he left Tianjin University in the warm cheers of the masses.

Ten Thousand People Cheer for Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao's car left Tianjin University. It passed through the center of Tianjin's bustling city—Heping Road—and stopped in front of the Zhengyangchun Restaurant in Tianjin.

As soon as Chairman Mao got out of the car, he was recognized—Ah! Chairman Mao is here!

"Chairman Mao is here!" "I saw Chairman Mao!" This exciting news spread quickly. Pedestrians on the street stopped, and people nearby who were working at home quickly ran out after hearing the news. In an instant, the area in front of Zhengyangchun, as well as the surrounding streets, became a sea of people.

Accompanied by Hebei Province Governor Liu Zihou and Tianjin Mayor Li Gengtao, Chairman Mao entered Zhengyangchun Restaurant and immediately asked where the kitchen was. Then, he walked directly into the narrow and hot kitchen and chatted with the cooks. He asked everyone if they had rest time and how much salary they earned each month. Everyone answered that they could get proper rest every week, and their average salary was 60-70 yuan per month, and they were living well. Chairman Mao smiled with satisfaction, shook hands with everyone, and then left the kitchen and went to the restaurant upstairs. These "cooks" who were looked down upon in the old society had long been turned over as masters of the country after liberation. Today, they were greeted by the most beloved leader of the people of the whole country. Everyone felt indescribable gratitude and excitement in their hearts. When Chairman Mao walked to the middle of the stairs, he saw a slogan: "Take the Rocket, Ride the East Wind, and Realize the Seven Satisfactory Work to Facilitate the People." He stopped, read it once, nodded with a smile, and expressed satisfaction with the enthusiasm of the restaurant staff.

It was already 2:00 PM. Chairman Mao had just sat down to talk to the presidents and Party committee secretaries of Tianjin and Nankai Universities when the people on the street became boiling. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" Applause and cheers shook the space, shook people's hearts. Chairman Mao stood up, opened the screen window, and leaned out to wave to everyone, and the crowd below became even more excited.

When the people calmed down, Chairman Mao sat down to eat lunch. But not long after, the crowd on the street cheered again, and the cheers and applause resounded through the clouds. Chairman Mao put down his chopsticks and then walked to the four windows on the south side, leaned out one by one, waved to everyone, and clapped his hands with everyone. After walking back and forth twice, the people calmed down, and Chairman Mao returned to the dining table to continue eating his lunch, which was already very late.

After the meal, more and more people gathered on the street, from several thousand to tens of thousands. The Young Pioneers, seeing Chairman Mao in the window, jumped and ran home to call their parents to see Chairman Mao. Old women with crutches, old men with gray hair, workers, shop assistants, and cadres also rushed to see Chairman Mao. One group left, and another group came. Shout! Jump! Cheer! Chairman Mao is here to meet everyone. Who doesn't want to see him? Who doesn't want to see him a few more times? At this time, Chairman Mao walked to the window again and again. Again and again, he waved and applauded to everyone. The last time—this was the fifth time—Chairman Mao nodded and waved to the masses in the street at the window for as long as five minutes. In the cheers of the crowd, in the dense crowd, people, with joy and excitement, and with great strength, gradually went to their own work posts. Our most beloved leader also took the car and slowly left.

Chairman Mao's inspection of Tianjin was the greatest glory for the people of the city. In his busy schedule, Chairman Mao also met with thousands of masses while eating lunch. How could people not be excited!

Chairman Mao's thoughts and wisdom gave people endless strength. In the evening, steelworkers by the Martin furnace, master craftsmen operating machine tools, textile female workers, suburban farmers, university professors, young students, Young Pioneers, and street citizens, some of them participated in symposiums and on-site meetings, re-studied their work, and expressed to the Party and Chairman Mao that they would muster greater enthusiasm to ensure abundant grain production, ensure the improvement of production indicators, and implement work-study programs... A new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward was launched on all fronts, and they will use greater achievements to report good news to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on National Day.

专栏：

    毛主席在天津
    8月10日到13日，毛主席在天津市进行了视察。这是全市人民永不忘记的幸福时刻。
    和农业社员们在一起
    10日下午四点多钟，中共河北省委书记处书记、河北省省长刘子厚，中共天津市委书记处书记、天津市市长李耕涛等随同毛主席首先来到了东郊区四合庄乡新立村农业社。乡总支副书记孟繁兴、社主任徐树清、社支部书记王星元等走出村外，正好迎上了毛主席。大家出神地凝视了半晌，齐声叫着“毛主席！”。一瞬间，毛主席已经走近了他们，亲切地和他们握手。他们万万没想到毛主席会来到自己社里，心情的激动，使他们紧紧地握住毛主席的手连声说：“毛主席好！”“毛主席好！”
    毛主席在稻田旁绿树成荫的路上缓步前行。路旁小溪的潺潺流水一股股地被引进绿油油的稻田里；刚刚吐穗扬花的水稻，散发出一阵阵的清香。毛主席安详地走过了溪上的小桥，来到稻田边，看着田埂上插着写有“上游”的红旗，问在这社搞重点的东郊区区长张福安：“上游”是什么意思。张福安说：社里在稻田管理中，十天各队评比一次，评比后，一类苗插“上游”旗，二类苗插“中游”旗，三类苗插“下游”旗，促使二三类苗赶上一类。
    “‘下游’了怎么赶，能不能赶呀！”毛主席关切地问。
    张福安回答说：“能赶，只要多施肥，加强管理，就能赶上。”他指着这片插着“上游”旗的稻田说，原来这块地是中游，社员们在管理上加了劲，半月功夫就争到了“上游”。毛主席听了笑着点点头，表示满意。
    毛主席顺着稻田边走着。他看到社员赵益和家的后墙上贴着第五生产队力争全区第一的大字报，就走过去仔细地看了一遍。毛主席对大字报上写的这个队力争第一的生产措施很感兴趣，随后就走进五队的稻田。他侧过身来问东郊区区委书记曾国栋：
      “这块稻田一亩有多少墩？”
    曾国栋说：“这块稻田共有三百多亩，每亩平均两万多墩，每墩合二十七、八株。”毛主席蹲在田上，用手分着稻株，察看稻子的生长情况。
    毛主席回过头来问大家：“这块稻田都是这样吗？”乡、社干部们回答说：“都是这样！”主席听了很是满意。毛主席站了起来，乡总支副书记孟繁兴说：“主席，里面还有一块密植两万二千多墩的好稻田呢！”毛主席笑着说：“好，咱们再去看一看。”
    毛主席看完这些稻田时，西下的太阳，还照得人热辣辣的。主席往回走着，精神焕发，毫无倦意。在路上，主席就像一个普通社干部关心社里的社务一样，问张福安、孟繁兴，第五队有多少户？多少劳动力？社里去年的稻子产量和今年的计划产量是多少？一亩稻田一年用多少肥？张福安、孟繁兴一一作了回答。
    这时候，毛主席来了的消息，已经传遍了全村。男女老少，从四面八方聚拢来，站在第五队稻田边，高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”八十多岁的曹振海老汉，也从远远的住处，沿着田间小路赶来了。他捋着白须，用手遮着太阳，在寻找毛主席。当他发现毛主席时，放下了拐杖，高呼着：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席身体健康！”毛主席摘下了草帽，向欢迎的人群，向这位鬓发苍白的老人招手。
    毛主席走到那里，那里便是欢呼沸腾的人群。毛主席来到了社里的试验队。稻田里正在干活的社员住了手，妇女们、儿童们也从田边的屋中走了出来：“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”的欢呼声在田野里荡漾着。毛主席脸上泛着慈祥和蔼的笑容，与试验队的社干部、社员一一握手。青年妇女社员吴贞兰握住毛主席的手激动地说：“毛主席，您好！”毛主席说：“你们好！”
    毛主席走到苇田边，区长张福安指着苇田对主席说：我们想把稻子与苇子进行杂交，将来可以长成稻子穗，苇子秸。不怕旱不怕涝，不锄不施肥一年一收割就行了。主席听了，对他们这种敢想敢干的精神，表示赞扬。
    主席关切地问：现在你们搞了试验没有？
    张福安回答：“还没有搞。”
    主席说：这两种东西是不是属于一类性质呀？你们可以试一试。张福安说：“毛主席，我们一定要试一试。”
    毛主席来到计划亩产五万斤水稻的试验田后，问生产队长张恩林：这块水稻亩产多少斤。张恩林说：“计划亩产五万斤。”毛主席称赞说：稻子长的很好！张福安告诉主席这块稻田幅度窄，在两边田埂上搭上木板就能够插秧和田间管理，社员劳动不用下水了，透风透阳光还好，叶子没有发黄的。主席听了很感兴趣。他指着远处的大片稻田说：那里可以搞成这样吧？人们劳动时，就再不用下水了。张福安说：可以搞。毛主席参观完试验田，又走到苇田边。主席叮咛张福安：水稻与苇子杂交工作，你们一定要试一试啊。张福安说：“好！我们一定好好的试验。”
    太阳平西，毛主席快要走了。听到毛主席来了的人们，沿着田埂，顺着小溪，奔向津（天津）塘（塘沽）公路旁的试验田来。从试验田边到公路桥头的两旁挤满了人群。人们高呼着：“共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”毛主席一时举手致意，一时谦和地和社员握手。
    就要上车了，欢腾的人群又把毛主席围拢起来。毛主席又一一与群众握手。直到主席上车走了很久以后，有些人才恋恋不舍地离开毛主席曾停留过的地方。
            在技术革命展览馆
    8月12日，毛主席参观了即将开幕的天津市工业技术革命展览会。全市职工为毛主席对他们劳动的关怀感到无限鼓舞。晚上八时，毛主席在河北省省长刘子厚、天津市市长李耕涛等同志陪同下来到展览会。毛主席下了汽车，稳健地走上了通向大厅的台阶，一面微笑着，一面和欢迎的人们握手，神采焕发，精神健壮。人们禁不住从心里为毛主席的健康感到幸福。
    毛主席穿过灯火通明的大厅，首先来到“东风馆”。这个馆内展出的几百种产品都是职工在总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进中敢想敢干、力争上游、赶上或超过世界先进水平。毛主席参观了天津拖拉机制造厂的热轧齿轮。刘树英厂长告诉主席：这是用高周波电滚将齿轮毛坯加热以后，就直接用机器轧成齿轮。采用这种方法，效率比用机床加工提高十倍到五十倍，并且加工余量小，可以节省25％的钢材。毛主席来到陈设着国产矽胶的展览台前，二十一岁的青年工人孙守纲在这里迎接了毛主席。当主席知道他就是研究矽胶成功的工人时，亲切地同他握手。主席伏在展览台前，仔细地看了各国的矽胶样品和质量比较表。英国的矽胶吸酸能力只有29％，日本的矽胶吸酸能力是46％，而我国自制的矽胶吸酸能力达到61％。主席赞扬地说好。这个馆内展出的许多赶上或超过世界先进水平的产品，都引起了毛主席的注意。他在无梭织布机、电火花机床、七头绕线机的前面，都仔细地观看了几分钟，当看到一幅图表上写着：“汽筒质量超过英国”的时候，毛主席笑着对人们说：汽筒也在赶？讲解员向主席介绍：我国的汽筒能打气二百五十磅，美国的只能打一百五十磅。李耕涛市长接着说“我们的气要比他们打得足”。这句一语双关的话，引得主席、职工都笑了。
    在重工业、机电工业馆里，工作人员向主席介绍了转炉炼矽钢的情况。过去有些工程技术人员认为只有电炉才能炼矽钢，可是大跃进以后工人敢想敢干，用转炉炼出了优质矽钢，冶炼时间缩短了80％，成本降低了三分之一。接着，毛主席又看到天津用土法轧制的矽钢片，高兴地说“你们都能制造了”。毛主席很满意职工改进技术、采用代用品、节约原材料的各项创造。新亚电器修配厂制成的单股异型刺绳，比以前的双股刺绳节约铅丝40％。天津锻压机床厂采用套料刀的加工法，从加工的大零件中掏出能做小零件的完整钢材。毛主席都仔细看了这些产品，询问了操作的情况。
    在休息的时候，主席又关心地询问了天津工业大跃进以来出现的新情况。当李耕涛市长说到当前主要问题是原材料供应不足的时候，毛主席指示：地方应该想办法建立独立的工业体系。首先是协作区，然后是许多省，只要有条件，都应建立比较独立的但是情况不同的工业体系。你们怎么样？刘子厚省长当时回答说，现在开始向独立方向搞，三、五年能建立起来。毛主席很关心专区、县的地方工业基础什么时候能够建立起来，随同主席视察的中共天津地委第一书记赵克汇报了非山区组织群众到其他地区上山开矿、大搞钢铁的情况，主席表示称赞。他说：一个粮食，一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了。毛主席对天津工业制造大型设备的工作也很关心，指示要抓紧，要早些安装，使用起来。他听到天津几个发电厂的修配工人正在制造发电机的消息，他说，这个办法很好。发电厂为什么只能发电而不能制造发电机呢？可以扩大一点，固定一些工人，成为发电厂附带的车间。
    毛主席又接连参观了化工、纺织、手工业、轻工业几个馆。展览会的工作人员指着几根粗、细不等的黑管告诉主席：这是用聚氯乙烯制造的。主席走到跟前，拿起粗管看看、又拿起细管看看，问着：“这个能代替钢铁吗？”工作人员说“行，能代替”。主席满意地点点头。纺织、轻工业和手工业馆的产品五彩缤纷、光亮引人。毛主席观看了薄如蝉翼的丝织品，色泽鲜艳的花布，各种毛毯毛呢、收音机、乐器等。毛主席向工作人员询问了棉纱的质量以后，在一幅写着“提高车速”的玻璃画版前停下来。工作人员告诉主席：纺二十三支经纱的机器，石家庄纺织厂开到四百六十二转，天津最高才开到三百转；纺二十一支纬纱的机器，石家庄开到三百二十转，天津最高才开到二百八十一转。现在我们正向石家庄的工人兄弟学习，争取赶上并超过他们。毛主席鼓励大家：要争上游。主席顺着商品台走过去，迎面跑来一个青年人热情地同主席握手。有人告诉主席：这是研究不用染料染丝绸的青年技术员梁树楷。主席关心地问他：“你的发明在哪里？”梁树楷领着主席走到墙上挂着一匹匹粉、浅黄、棕色丝绸的旁边说，“这就是不用染料染成的”。接着，他又告诉主席：“还有色泽更好看的，没拿到展览会来。我们准备送到北京向主席献礼”。主席说“谢谢你们”。接着，主席又亲切地和他谈话、问他是哪里人、在什么学校念过书。梁树楷都一一作了回答。毛主席微笑着又一次伸出手来，梁树楷紧紧地握住。
    夜里十一点了。毛主席在展览馆参观了将近三个小时，精神还像来时那样好。在离开展览会的时候，毛主席同职工一一握手，展览会的工作人员聚集在毛主席的汽车旁，怀着依恋不舍的心情欢送了毛主席。
              参观学校办的工厂
    毛主席来天津大学视察的消息，很快传遍了这个有二十多万平方公尺面积、有九千多师生员工的中国的新型大学。13日上午十一时过五分，几辆汽车缓缓地驶入津大的校门，一直开到办公楼前停下来。在各个教室的、宿舍的一些学生、老师，从四面八方，向着办公楼跑来。主席下了汽车，由河北省刘子厚省长、天津市李耕涛市长和中共天津市委书记处书记王亢之同志陪同着，走进了天津大学党委会的办公室。天津大学校长张国藩、党委书记贾震欢迎毛主席。接着，亲切的谈话开始了。
    张国藩校长向主席汇报了学校的情况。张校长说：这个学校已经有98％的学生参加了勤工俭学，今年下学期还准备搞几个班半工半读。主席说：这样很好，本来光读书本上的，没有亲自去做，有的连看也没有看过，用的时候，就做不出产品来。一搞勤工俭学、半工半读，这样有了学问，也就是劳动者了。主席还说：河南省长葛县有的中学，勤工俭学搞的好，学生进步快，升学的多。有的中学没有搞勤工俭学，就不好，学生升学的少，考不取，学问不行。他们光念书本，没有学进去，把脑筋学坏了。主席问王亢之同志天津中学有没有勤工俭学，王亢之同志回答说，天津市近百所中学都已搞起勤工俭学来了。六十多所中学还建立了工厂或生产车间。主席说：好啊！学校是工厂，工厂也是学校，农业合作社也是学校，要好好办。
    毛主席对天津大学在短时期办起许多工厂很感兴趣。毛主席说：有些先生也得进步，形势逼着他们进步，他们动动手就行了。五十岁以上的教师可以不动手了，青年的中年的都要动动手。搞科学研究的人，也应该动动手，不然一辈子不动手也不好。张国藩校长汇报说：现在同学们搞技术革命的劲头很大。有的为了向国庆节献礼，昼夜突击，说服他们也说服不了。主席很关切地说：连夜搞是否把人搞瘦了呢？还是注意有节奏的生产，有节奏的休息和劳动。校长和党委书记表示，要把主席的关怀，传达给学生们。
    将近十二点的时候，主席到了门外的平台上，这时期待着与主席见面的同学们，此伏彼起地喊起了“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”主席和大家一起鼓掌，从东边走到西边，来回走动了几次。接着就到学校办的几个工厂去参观了。
    毛主席在人们的夹道欢呼声中，走进了学校办起的机工厂，一百多部车床在轰轰响着，多少人的脸上泛起了笑容。多少双眼睛在注视着人们渴望见到的人。每个人的心里都盼望着主席到自己的机器旁边来。主席慢慢地走着，几乎每个机床都走到了。机械系二年级的女学生张美珍，在主席进门后，她再也平静不下去了。主席越走近，她看得越清，心也跳得越厉害。她有许多话要和自己最敬爱的领袖说啊，主席在她的车床旁停下来，她反而激动的一句话也说不出来了。还是主席先开口了，主席问她：“你现在能够达到几级工的水平？”“勤工俭学好不好？”……张美珍看主席是那样的平易近人，那样的耐心和亲切，她的心反而不再那么跳动了，很平静地一一作了回答。主席走到一台大的旋床前面。一个叫陈经斗的二年级学生，正在旋一个大点的圆形部件，铁屑飞舞，这个同学张起两个臂来，挡着飞起的铁屑，不使它碰到主席身上。一个个子不高的叫王红玉的女学生，满手油渍，正干着上劲咧，主席来到了她的跟前，在仔细地看了她的操作以后，要和她握手。她激动地说：“我这满手油！”她不敢往外伸，怕弄脏了主席的手。主席还是紧紧地握了她的手。
    主席一连参观了机工厂、铸工厂，在休息以后，又坐上汽车到一公里以外的地方，看了同学们正在自己动手兴建的硫酸厂，到下午一时十分，才在群众热烈的欢呼声中，离开天津大学。
              万众欢呼毛主席
    毛主席乘坐的汽车离开天津大学。穿过天津的闹市中心——和平路，在天津市正阳春饭店门前停了下来。
    毛主席一下车就被人们认出来了——啊！毛主席到这里来了！
      “毛主席来了！”“我看到毛主席了！”这个激动人心的消息，很快就传开了。街上的行人站住了，附近的正在家里劳动的人们听到后也赶快跑来了。霎时，正阳春的门前，附近的街道上，成了一片人海。
    毛主席在河北省省长刘子厚、天津市市长李耕涛等同志陪同下，一走进正阳春饭店，就先打听厨房在那里？接着就直接走进了又窄、又热的厨房，和炊事员们攀谈起来，他问大家有没有休息时间，每月挣多少工资？大家回答了每星期都能得到适当休息，工资平均每月六七十元，生活上过得满好。主席满意地笑着，和大家握了手，才离开了厨房，到楼上的餐厅去。这些在旧社会被人瞧不起的“厨子”，在解放以后，早就翻了身，成了国家的主人，今天，又受到了全国人民最敬爱的领袖的亲切问候，每个人的心里，都有说不出来的感激和兴奋。主席走到楼梯中间的时候，看到了一张标语：“跨火箭，乘东风，实现七满意工作来便民”，停下来念了一遍，笑着点了点头，对饭店职工的干劲表示满意。
    这时已经下午两点了。毛主席刚刚坐下来，同天津、南开两个大学的校长、党委书记谈话，街上的人们沸腾起来了。“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”掌声，欢呼声，震荡着太空，振荡着人心。主席站起来，打开纱窗，伸出头去，向大家招手致意，下面的人群更加激动了。
    当人们平静下来的时候主席才坐下来吃午饭。可是过了不大一会儿，街上的人群又欢腾起来，欢呼声和掌声响彻云霄，主席放下筷子，这时，又走到南面的四个窗口，挨个地探出头去，向大家招手，同大家一起鼓掌。这样来回走了两趟，人们平静下来，主席才又回到饭桌前继续吃完那顿已经很晚了的午饭。
    饭后，街上的人群越聚越多，由几千人，聚到了几万人。红领巾们，在窗口上见到了毛主席，欢蹦乱跳地跑回家去，叫他们的爸爸妈妈去看毛主席。拄着拐杖的老婆婆，须发斑白的老汉，工人，店员，机关干部，也争先恐后地跑来看望毛主席。这一批走了，那一批又来了。喊呀！跳呀！欢呼呀！毛主席来和大家见面了，谁不想看看呢？谁不想多看几眼呢？这时主席又三番两次地走到窗口。再三再四地向大家挥手，鼓掌。最后一次——这是第五次了，主席在窗前向街上的群众点头招手达五分钟之久。在万众欢呼声中，在密集的人群中，人们带着喜悦兴奋、巨大的力量，逐渐走上自己的工作岗位，我们最敬爱的领袖也乘着汽车，缓缓地离开了。
    毛主席视察了天津市，是全市人民最大的光荣。在百忙中，主席又趁吃午饭的时候同成千上万的群众见了面，人们怎会不激动呢！
    毛主席的思想、智慧给了人们无穷无尽的力量。晚间在马丁炉旁的炼钢工人，操纵机床的老师傅、纺织女工、郊区农民、大学教授、青年学生、少先队员以及街道市民，他们有的参加了座谈会，现场会，重新研究了工作，向党和毛主席表示要鼓起更大的干劲，保证粮食丰产，保证提高生产指标，实行勤工俭学……在各个战线上掀起新的大跃进高潮，用更大的成绩到国庆时向毛主席和党中央报喜。
