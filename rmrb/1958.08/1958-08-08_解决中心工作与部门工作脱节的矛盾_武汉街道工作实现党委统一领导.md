Resolving the Contradiction Between Central Tasks and Departmental Work
Wuhan Streets Achieve Unified Party Committee Leadership

    (Our Wuhan dispatch) Reporter Zhang Wei reports: During the rectification movement, Wuhan city streets resolved a fundamental issue in the Party organization's leadership of street work, namely: the universal implementation of the "three unifications, three packages, and one-way leadership" method, fully realizing the Party's unified leadership over grassroots work. This enabled the smooth completion of central tasks and departmental work, overcoming the chaotic state of each going its own way in the past. Cadres and the masses are all very happy, and street work has taken on an unprecedentedly active outlook.

    Before 1956, street offices, police stations, women's federations, and the Communist Youth League in Wuhan all issued orders separately according to their respective departments, each pursuing its own agenda and poaching activists from each other. As a result, no one focused on central tasks, there was no cooperation between departments, and departmental work could not be completed either, which made the masses very dissatisfied. After the end of 1956, although Party general branches (or branches) were established in each street, the departments believed that the Party general branches could only do "Party affairs" and should not "interfere" in the work of each department. The Party general branch at that time was only like a consultative body and did not realize the Party's unified leadership over street work, and street work remained in a chaotic state. This year, during the street rectification, the masses sharply criticized the lack of cooperation between departments. The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee instructed to implement the "three unifications, three packages, and one-way leadership" method in each street ("three unifications" means that the street Party general branch uniformly organizes the strength of each department, uniformly arranges various tasks, and unifies the thinking of each department; "three packages" means that the general branch committee members are responsible for completing central tasks by division of territory, responsible for completing the business of each department, and responsible for the political and ideological education of the masses). The Party general branch committees of each street (composed of full-time secretaries and directors of street offices, police station chiefs, women's federation directors, Communist Youth League general branch secretaries, etc.) conducted in-depth discussions on the issue of the Party general branch's leadership, combined with the question of "who does street work serve and who does it rely on." Everyone examined the reasons for the lack of unified leadership and the lack of unity among departments in the past, which was the lack of a clear view of who to serve, and the influence of departmentalism. After discussion, it was made clear that everyone recognized that whether it was public security work or youth or women's work on the streets, all were work to serve the people and serve socialist construction. No one should emphasize the special, and all should obey the unified leadership of the Party to achieve the "three unifications, three packages, and one-way leadership" method.

    After each street implemented the "three unifications, three packages, and one-way leadership" method, the overall perspective of the cadres was strengthened first. Recently, there have been more than 20 large and small street works in the past three or four months, and as many as 48 at times. The street Party general branch would hold a meeting at the beginning of the month, where each department would present all the tasks, and according to the requirements of the city and the specific conditions of the street, jointly discuss and determine one or two central tasks, and at the same time study how to combine the central tasks to complete the work of each department. Each week, the mass activities of each residents' committee were given unified and specific arrangements so that the decisions of the general branch became the actions of the masses. Therefore, it not only ensured the completion of central tasks, but also completed the work of each department at the same time.

    Secondly, ideological education for activists and residents was strengthened from top to bottom. In the past, street offices, police stations, women's federations, etc. only focused on grabbing activists, but no one regularly cultivated and educated activists. No one cared when activists got sick, so about 30% of the previous activists were unwilling to come out to participate in residents' work. Now, the street Party general branch committee members are responsible for leading the ideological education of the masses by division of territory, the cadres and police in charge of the area are responsible for the ideological education of the activists in their area, and the activists are assigned to be responsible for the ideological education of the residents, forming a layer-by-layer responsibility system. Therefore, the ideological problems of the masses are helped to be solved at any time, and the lives of the masses are also often cared for.

    The "three unifications, three packages, and one-way leadership" method has promoted the deepening of the work style of cadres and police. They have universally implemented the "three togethers" (work together, discuss together, share weal and woe), the "threeizations" (labor massization, labor regularization, life popularization) and engaged in experimental fields, and have closely linked the relationship between leaders and the masses.

    Now, the work of more than 80 streets in Wuhan is very active. More than 3,830 nursery stations have been established in the city's streets, and each residents' committee has one to four nursery stations, accommodating more than 100,000 children, achieving the goal of universal childcare in the city. Each street has organized more than 4,000 economic mutual aid groups with more than 100,000 people participating, eliminating mutual credit associations and usury exploitation. In order to solve the difficulties of household chores after women join social production, a total of 44 street canteens have been established in the city. Residents of each street have also built 120,000 firewalls, so that no fire has occurred in the streets from March to now. The clearance rate of criminal cases by public security organs has also greatly improved, and many long-unsolved cases have been solved in a very short time with the help of the masses.

### 解决中心工作与部门工作脱节的矛盾  武汉街道工作实现党委统一领导

    解决中心工作与部门工作脱节的矛盾
    武汉街道工作实现党委统一领导
    本报武汉讯  记者张碨报道：武汉市街道在整风运动中，解决了党组织领导街道工作的一个根本问题，即：普遍实行了“三统三包一元化”的领导方法，充分实现了党对基层工作的统一领导。使中心工作和部门工作顺利完成，克服了过去各搞一套的混乱状态。干部、群众皆大欢喜，街道工作出现了空前未有的活跃局面。
    1956年以前，武汉市各街道的办事处、派出所、妇联、青年团等各按条条下达自搞一套，互相挖积极分子，结果中心工作没人抓，各部门之间互不协作，部门工作也完成不了，群众很不满意。1956年底以后，虽然各街道分别建立了党总支（或支部），但各部门认为党总支只能做“党务”，不应该“干涉”各部门工作。当时的党总支只像一个协商机关，而没有实现党对街道工作的统一领导，街道工作仍然陷于混乱状态。今年，街道整风中，群众对各部门工作不协作的现象提出了尖锐的批评。中共武汉市委便指示在各街道实行“三统三包一元化”的领导方法（“三统”是由街道党总支统一组织各部门力量、统一安排各项工作、并统一各部门的思想；“三包”是由总支委员分片包完成中心工作，包完成各部门业务，包对群众的政治思想教育）。各街道党总支委员会（由专职书记和办事处主任、派出所长、妇联主任、团总支书记等组成）结合“街道工作为谁服务和依靠谁”的问题，对党总支的领导问题进行了深入的讨论。大家检查过去领导不统一，各部门不团结的原因，是没有明确为谁服务的观点，本位主义思想在作怪。经过讨论，明确了无论大家认识到不论是街道上的公安工作还是青年、妇女工作，都是为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务的工作，都不应该强调特殊，都应该服从党的统一领导，实现“三统三包一元化”的领导方法。
    各街道贯彻了“三统三包一元化”的领导方法之后，首先是加强了干部的全面观点。最近三、四个月来，街道工作大大小小有二十多项以上，多时达四十八项。街道党总支便在月初开一次会，由各部门把任务全摆出来，按照市里要求和本街具体情况，共同讨论确定一、二项中心工作，同时研究了如何结合中心完成各部门的工作。每周又对各居民委员会的群众活动加以统一的具体的安排，使总支的决定变成群众的行动。因此，既保证了中心工作的完成，又同时完成了各部门工作。
    其次是从上到下地加强了对积极分子和居民群众的思想教育。过去街道办事处和派出所、妇联等光抓积极分子，却没有人经常培养和教育积极分子，积极分子病了也没有人管，所以以前的积极分子中有30％左右都不愿出来参加居民工作。现在街道党总支委员分片包干领导群众的思想教育，管段的干部和民警包干本段积极分子的思想教育，积极分子又分工负责居民的思想教育，形成了层层包干。因此，群众的思想问题随时有人帮助解决，群众的生活也有人时常关心了。
    “三统三包一元化”的领导方法，促使干部、民警的工作作风深入了。他们普遍贯彻了三同（同工作、同商量、同甘苦）、三化（劳动群众化、劳动经常化、生活大众化）和搞试验田，密切了领导和群众的关系。
    现在，武汉市八十多条街的工作都非常活跃。全市街道已经建立了三千八百三十多个幼儿站，每个居民委员会都有一个到四个幼儿站，共收容儿童十万多个，达到全市托儿化。各街组织了有十万多人参加的四千来个经济互助组，消灭了标会和高利贷剥削。为了解决家庭妇女参加社会生产后家务劳动的困难，全市共办了街道食堂四十四个。各街道居民还修起十二万个防火墙，使街道从3月到现在没有发生过一次火灾。公安机关破案率也大大提高，许多长期破不了的案件，在群众帮助下，很短时间内就破获了。
