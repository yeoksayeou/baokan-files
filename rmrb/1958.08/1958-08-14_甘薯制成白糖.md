Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 13th - The Huanghuayuan Brewery of the Chongqing Vegetable Company has recently made white sugar from sweet potatoes, finding a new use for the greatly increased production of sweet potatoes this year.

　　The idea of using sweet potatoes to trial-produce white sugar was put forward by Cheng Kezhong, deputy director of the Huanghuayuan Brewery, and Communist Youth League members Zheng Naixing and Chen Wen. From July 25th to August 11th, they conducted more than thirty trials and finally produced the first batch of white sugar. This sugar is white in color, nutritionally better than sucrose, and slightly less sweet than sucrose. From the trial production, it is estimated that every 100 jin of sweet potatoes can produce six to seven jin of white sugar and many by-products. The manufacturing process of making white sugar from sweet potatoes is not complicated. After the sweet potatoes are made into starch, hydrochloric acid is added to saccharify the starch, then soda ash is added to achieve slight acidity; then it is filtered to turn it into a thin sugar syrup, decolorized with activated carbon, and then evaporated to become a concentrated sugar liquid; the concentrated sugar liquid is cooled and a small amount of crystallization medium – a small amount of glucose – is added, and after about five to six days of cooling time, the waste sugar liquid is removed with a centrifugal honey separator, and the white sugar is made.

　　甘薯制成白糖
    新华社重庆13日电　重庆市蔬菜公司黄花园酿造厂最近用甘薯制成白糖，为今年增产数量极大的甘薯找到了新的用途。
    用甘薯试制白糖的主意是黄花园酿造厂副厂长程克忠、共青团员郑乃兴、陈汶开出的。他们从7月25日到8月11日先后试制了三十多次，终于制成第一批白糖。这种糖，色洁白，营养较蔗糖好，甜味略低于蔗糖。从试制中估计，每一百斤甘薯可以制成六、七斤白糖和很多副产品。甘薯做白糖的制造过程并不复杂。甘薯制成淀粉以后加上盐酸，使淀粉糖化，再加纯碱，达到微酸性；然后进行过滤，使之变成稀糖浆，用活性炭脱色，再经过蒸发过程成为浓糖液；把浓糖液冷却并稍加结晶媒介物——少量葡萄糖，约经过五到六天冷却时间，用离心分蜜机取掉废糖液，洁白的糖就制成了。
