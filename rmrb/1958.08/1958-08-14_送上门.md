Editor's Note

　　Delivered to the Door
    To train technical cadres, we must also break down superstitions and be bold in creating. The practice of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power is an example.
    In order to implement the class line and adapt to the development and requirements of the situation, many universities have opened special classes for veteran cadres, "recruiting" students for training. This is one method. There is also another method of "delivering to the door," where schools send teachers to set up classes and teach on-site according to the specific needs and conditions of a certain region or unit. This is the practice of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power.
    It should be said that this is a new method. Its advantages are reflected in its "close integration with reality, simplicity, and feasibility." It also breaks old conventions and establishes a new method of "doing what you need, learning what you lack." Because the teaching content is based on local materials, students accept it quickly and can easily apply it, which enables rapid training of cadres to solve the urgent need for a large number of technical cadres. Another feature of this teaching is its flexible and simple approach, requiring only a few rooms, a blackboard, and chalk. It does not require a lot of equipment and teachers, which is very valuable.
    Training a large number of technical cadres is an important link in realizing the tasks of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. There is also a struggle between two lines in the methods of training. This "delivered to the door" approach is a direct result of daring to break through old educational concepts such as school "formality" and technical "mystery." At the same time, it once again proves that ideological emancipation leads to creation.

　　送上门
    培训技术干部，同样要破除迷信、大胆创造。武汉水利学院的做法，就是一个范例。
    为了贯彻阶级路线，适应形势的发展和要求，不少高等学校开办了老干部特别班，把学员“招进来”加以培养，这是一种方法；还有另外一种“送上门”的办法，根据某一地区或单位的特定需要和具体条件，由学校派出教师，就地开班，现场教学。这就是武汉水利学院的做法。
    应该说，这是一种新办法。它的好处表现在“紧密结合实际、简易可行”。并且打破旧的框框，树立了“干什么，学什么；缺什么，学什么”的新办法。由于教学内容是就地取材，学员接受快，容易运用，这就能够用速成办法培训干部，解救当前需要大量技术干部的燃眉之急。这种教学的另一个特点是方式灵活简易，只要几间房子、黑板和粉笔就能举办，不需要大量设备和教师，这都是十分可贵的。
    培训大量技术干部，是实现技术革命和文化革命任务中的一个重要环节。在培训的方法上同样存在着两条道路的斗争。这种“送上门”的做法，正是敢于突破学校“正规”、技术“神秘”等旧教育观念的直接结果，同时，也再一次证明了思想解放，才会有所创造。
