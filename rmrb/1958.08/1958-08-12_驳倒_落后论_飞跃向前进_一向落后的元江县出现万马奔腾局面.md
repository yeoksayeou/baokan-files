Refuting the "Backwardness Theory" and Leaping Forward
　　Yuanjiang County, Once Backward, Shows a Scene of Ten Thousand Horses Galloping

　　(Our dispatch) Reporter Ye Zijian reports: After refuting the "backwardness theory," Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, where various ethnic minorities live together, has seen its industrial and agricultural production leap forward like ten thousand horses galloping.

　　Yuanjiang County has a population of more than 80,000, including Dai, Hani, Yi, Miao, Han and other eight ethnic groups. Ethnic minorities account for more than 80% of the total population. In the past, most cadres in the county believed that Yuanjiang was located on the border, with complex ethnic relations and many backward customs, so everything could only be done slowly. For several years, it has been a well-known backward county in Yuxi Prefecture.

　　During the rectification campaign, the Yuanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China raised the question of how to view the particularities of ethnic minority areas and how to correctly understand the dialectical relationship between commonality and particularity. A mass debate was conducted among farmers of all ethnic groups in the county, and the masses were mobilized to offer opinions to the cadres. Through the debate, ethnic minority farmers unanimously believed that in order to join the ranks of advanced nationalities more quickly, a great leap forward in production was necessary. They also criticized the cadres for not seeing the progress made by ethnic minorities in recent years under the education of the Party, and for not believing in the power of the masses, and therefore being listless and conservative. With the help of farmers of all ethnic groups, more than 1,000 cadres in the county who participated in the rectification campaign realized that the fundamental common demand of the people of all ethnic groups is to realize a great leap forward in socialist construction. In daily work, full consideration should be given to the characteristics of all ethnic groups in terms of political, economic, cultural and psychological conditions, so as to proceed from reality and adopt appropriate methods and steps to achieve the common goal better and faster. No ethnic characteristic can negate the commonality of all ethnic groups in taking the socialist road. The cadres of all ethnic groups also debated on three aspects: 1. Should backward ethnic minority areas catch up with the advanced or crawl slowly? 2. What attitude should be adopted in the face of the struggle between the two roads and two lines contained in the commonality and particularity? 3. What kind of resolute and forceful leap forward measures should be taken? In the debate, the "special case theory" was completely bankrupt, and some cadres who had changed their thinking confessed to the farmers the right-leaning conservative thinking hidden behind the "special case theory."

　　The liberation of thought stimulated soaring enthusiasm. Cadres of all ethnic groups tried their best to support the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, challenged decadent customs, and a scene of ten thousand horses galloping appeared throughout the county.

　　This year, Yuanjiang County experienced the worst drought in more than 30 years, with no rain for more than five months. The Secretary and County Head of the Yuanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China took tools and luggage to the reservoir construction site and worked hard day and night with the people of all ethnic groups. In half a year, they built and renovated reservoirs and canals that could irrigate nearly 100,000 mu of farmland, which is more than the total amount of water conservancy projects built in the past eight years. The County Committee also actively promoted water lifting tools such as bamboo dragons created by the masses. 80% of the county worked hard for three months and saved more than 20,000 mu of double-cropping rice from drought. At the same time, the habit of not accumulating fertilizer has also been changed. People of all ethnic groups have toilets, and pigs and cattle have stalls.

　　This year, the area of double-cropping early rice in Yuanjiang County has expanded to more than 25,000 mu, an increase of one-third compared with last year. Due to sufficient water and fertilizer, early rice is generally high-yielding. The average yield per unit area has increased by more than 20%, and the total output has increased by 80% compared with last year.

　　The industry in Yuanjiang County has also developed surprisingly. In the past, this county did not even have blacksmiths and carpenters. This spring, carpenters were invited from the mainland, and ten iron smelting furnaces were transported in. In less than half a year, 105 small factories and mines have been established throughout the county, including iron smelting, agricultural tool manufacturing, and sugar extraction factories. The total industrial output value this year will catch up with agriculture.

　　The appearance of Yuanjiang is changing dramatically. At an evaluation meeting held in Yuxi Prefecture in mid-July, this past "backward county" received a mobile red flag because its various tasks have been at the forefront.

　　·Editor's Note·
　　Commonality and Particularity

　　The report from Yuanjiang County raises the issue of commonality and particularity. Commonality: all ethnic groups take the socialist road; particularity: the characteristics of each ethnic minority.

　　For several years, Yuanjiang County has been a backward county in Yuxi Prefecture. One of the reasons is that it has not solved the problem of commonality and particularity well. Many cadres made such a mistake, that is, they only saw the particularities of ethnic minority areas, but did not see the commonality between ethnic minorities and advanced nationalities. These cadres not only failed to see the commonality, but also failed to see the change that the particularities of ethnic minority brothers have gradually decreased and the commonalities have gradually increased after several years of education by the Party, which will inevitably lead to the conclusion that in ethnic minority areas, everything can only be done "slowly."

　　Is it really only possible to "do it slowly"? No. The facts of Yuanjiang County convincingly prove that as long as we see the commonality of the people of all ethnic groups demanding the realization of socialism, liberate our minds, adopt correct methods and steps, and lead ethnic minorities to work hard and practically, we will surely quickly change the backward situation and catch up with advanced nationalities soon.

　　Is it to come quickly or slowly? The key lies entirely in the leadership, in whether the leadership can correctly understand and handle the dialectical relationship between commonality and particularity between ethnic minorities and advanced nationalities.

### 驳倒“落后论”飞跃向前进　一向落后的元江县出现万马奔腾局面

    驳倒“落后论”飞跃向前进
　　一向落后的元江县出现万马奔腾局面
    本报讯　记者叶子健报道：少数民族杂居的云南省元江县驳倒了
  “落后论”后，工农业生产像万马奔腾般飞跃前进。
    元江县有八万多人，包括傣、哈尼、彝、苗、汉等八个民族。少数民族占总人口的80％以上。过去县里大部分干部都认为：元江地处边疆，民族关系复杂，落后的风俗习惯较多，任何事情都只能慢慢来。几年来，一直是玉溪专区有名的落后县。
    在整风中，中共元江县委提出如何看待少数民族地区的特殊性？怎样正确地认识共同性和特殊性的辩证关系？在全县各族农民中进行全民大辩论，并发动群众给干部提意见。少数民族农民通过辩论，一致认为要更快地跻于先进民族的行列，必须生产大跃进。他们还批评干部看不见少数民族近年来在党的教育下所取得的进步，不相信群众的力量，所以暮气沉沉，因循保守。全县参加整风的一千多名干部，在各族农民的帮助下，认识到：各民族人民根本的共同的要求是实现社会主义建设大跃进。而在日常工作中要充分考虑各民族政治、经济、文化和心理状态等方面的特点，是为了从实际出发，采取妥善的方法和步骤，更好更快地实现共同目的。任何民族特点，都不能否定各民族走社会主义道路的共同性。各族干部们还从三个方面进行了辩论：一、落后的少数民族地区是应该迎头赶上先进，还是慢慢地爬行？二、共同性和特殊性之间包含着两条道路和两条路线的斗争，在这个斗争面前应该采取什么态度？三、采取何种坚决有力的跃进措施？在辩论中，“特殊论”彻底破产，一些思想上有转变的干部，分别向农民们检查了隐藏在“特殊论”后面的右倾保守思想。
    思想的解放，激发了冲天的干劲。各族干部竭力支持群众的积极性和创造性，向陈腐的习俗挑战，全县出现了一个万马奔腾的局面。
    今年元江县发生了三十多年来没有过的大旱象，五个多月没有下过一场雨。元江县的中共县委书记和县长都带着工具、行李到水库工地，和各族人民一道日夜苦战，半年内兴修、整修了可以灌溉近十万亩田地的水库水渠，比过去八年修的水利总和还要多。县委并积极推广群众创造的竹龙等提水工具。全县80％的人苦战三月，保住了两万多亩双季稻免于受旱。同时，不积肥的习惯也已改变。各族人民都有了厕所，猪牛都有了厩。
    元江县今年双季早稻的面积扩大到二万五千多亩，比去年增加了三分之一。由于水足肥多，早稻一般都丰产。单位面积产量平均增加了二成以上，总产量比去年增加了八成。
    元江县的工业也有惊人的发展。过去这个县甚至连铁匠和木匠都没有。今年春天才从内地请来木匠，运来了十盘炼铁炉。在不到半年的时间里，全县办起了一百零五个小型厂矿，炼铁、农具制造、榨糖等工厂都有了。工业总产值今年就要赶上农业。
    元江的面貌正在激剧改变。在玉溪专区7月中旬的一次评比会上，这个过去的“落后县”得到了流动红旗，因为它各项工作都已经走在前面。
　　·编辑的话·
　　共同性和特殊性
    元江县的报道中提出了一个共同性和特殊性的问题。共同性：各民族走社会主义道路；特殊性：各个少数民族的特点。
    几年来，元江县一直是玉溪专区的落后县。原因之一，就是没有很好解决共同性和特殊性的问题。不少干部犯了这样一种毛病，就是只看见少数民族地区的特殊性，而看不到少数民族和先进民族之间的共同性。这些干部不但看不到共同性，而且还看不到少数民族兄弟经过党的几年教育，特殊性已逐渐减少、共同性已逐渐增多这一变化，这就必然要得出这样的结论：在少数民族地区任何事情都只能“慢慢来”。
    真的只能“慢慢来”么？不。元江县的事实令人信服地证明了：只要看到了各族人民要求实现社会主义这一共同性，解放了思想，采取正确的方法和步骤，领导少数民族实干苦干，就一定会迅速改变落后面貌，很快赶上先进民族。
    是快快来还是慢慢来？关键完全在于领导，在于领导能否正确认识、处理少数民族和先进民族之间的共同性和特殊性的辩证关系。
