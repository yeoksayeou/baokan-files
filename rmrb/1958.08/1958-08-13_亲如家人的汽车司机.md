　　A Car Driver as Close as Family
    At 6:00 PM on July 18th, Comrade Ren from our compound hired car number 40 from the Wanming Road Branch of the Capital Automobile Company to go to the hospital to give birth. While en route, the pregnant woman suddenly experienced intense abdominal pain. In this extremely urgent situation, the driver, Comrade Liu Chuantang, immediately stopped the car, attentively comforted the pregnant woman, and assisted her in giving birth. The child was born smoothly, and both mother and child were healthy and safe. He then took the mother back home and helped her into the house, not leaving until everything was settled. All of us in the compound were moved by the actions of this driver comrade. Everyone said in unison: Comrade Liu Chuantang is truly a good driver as close as family.

　　亲如家人的汽车司机
    7月18日下午六时，我们同院的任同志雇了首都汽车公司万明路分站的四十号汽车去医院生小孩。车行至半路，产妇突然腹疼不止。在这万分紧急的关头，司机刘传堂同志立刻把车停下来，一面关心地安慰产妇，一面照顾产妇分娩。孩子顺利地生下来了，母子健康无恙。他又将产妇送回家里，并且将产妇托入室内，直到一切都安置好了，才离开。我们这些同院的人都被这位司机同志的行动感动了。大家异口同声地说：刘传堂同志真是一位亲如家人的好司机。
