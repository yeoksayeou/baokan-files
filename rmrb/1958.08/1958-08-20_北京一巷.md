Beijing's Da Chuan Road Second Lane in Xuanwu District is a narrow alley. Two rows of low houses, with large colorful murals painted on the walls saying "Everyone exert great effort, everyone strive to be upstream", flowers planted beside the houses and in the courtyards, and everything swept clean. Some doors have wooden signs for libraries, canteens, and nurseries. At one end of the alley, a mat shed has been erected, and sixteen women are working hard. These collective economic and welfare undertakings were established by the twenty-eight households in this lane after three days and nights of hard work. After organizing for production, production efficiency has increased, saving the state more than 1,000 jin of coal per month, and they themselves eat better and save money.

When organizing production, they encountered the difficulty of not having a production site. Someone suggested that a half-alley near a toilet, with very few pedestrians all year round, could be used as a production workshop. But everyone knew that the alley was open-air, neither sheltering from the wind nor from the rain. Later, everyone suggested building a mat shed, determined to turn it into a beautiful workshop. They worked hard into the night and finally put up the mat shed.

　　北京一巷
    北京市宣武区大川路二巷，是一条狭窄的小巷。两排矮矮的房子，墙上画着“人人鼓干劲，个个争上游”的大幅彩色壁画，宅旁院内种着花，到处打扫得干干净净。有的门上挂着图书馆、食堂、托儿所的木牌子。胡同口的一端，搭起了席棚，十六个妇女在紧张地劳动着。这些集体经济和福利事业，是这条巷子二十八户居民苦战三昼夜兴办起来的。组织起来生产以后，生产效率提高了，每月可给国家节约一千多斤煤，她们自己也吃得又好又省钱。
    在组织起来搞生产时，曾碰到没有生产场地的困难。有人提出附近一条通向厕所的半截胡同，终年很少行人，可以做为生产车间。但是谁也知道胡同是露天的，既不挡风，也不挡雨。后来，大家提出搭一个席棚，非把它变成一个漂亮的车间不行。他们苦战到深夜，终于把席棚搭起来了。
