Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 4th: Iraq Republic Radio broadcast an Amman dispatch on the evening of August 3rd stating that, due to the Hussein authorities launching large-scale arrests of the Jordanian people, a wave of terror is now sweeping across Jordan.

The broadcast said that the Chief Military Prosecutor has demanded the death penalty for sixty Jordanians accused of plotting to overthrow the current regime.

According to a broadcast by Amman Radio on the same day, twenty-seven people were again tried in the Amman court that day, arrested on the trumped-up charge of smuggling weapons from Syria to Jordan. The court later announced an adjournment until further notice; the proceedings of the trial were not disclosed.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: TASS, London, August 3rd: The British "Observer" published an article by its Amman correspondent, reporting that the Hussein regime in Jordan is tottering. The correspondent had to go to Cyprus to send the article in order to avoid censorship by the Jordanian authorities.

He listed materials to show that the Hussein regime is maintained by the British army's presence in Jordan and police suppression. The reporter wrote that Western diplomats estimate that, in the Jordanian Arab army, about 150 officers and non-commissioned officers have been thrown into prison on suspicion of participating in the unsuccessful conspiracy of July 17.

The reporter concluded by saying that many diplomats believe that once the British troops withdraw, the Hussein regime will soon collapse.

Nicosia, Cyprus, August 3rd: Western journalists arriving in Cyprus from Jordan say that since the July 14th coup in Iraq, King Hussein of Jordan has rarely appeared in public. Every time he leaves the palace built on the hilltop, he is escorted by a jeep-borne guard of machine gunners and infantry.

    侯赛因王朝垂死挣扎
    约旦全国陷入恐怖浪潮
    新华社大马士革4日电　伊拉克共和国电台3日晚上广播的安曼消息说，由于侯赛因当局对约旦人民展开了大规模的逮捕，现在约旦全国各地都陷入恐怖的浪潮中。
    广播说，军事检察总长要求把被控图谋推翻现政权的六十个约旦人都判处死刑。
    据安曼电台同一天广播说，当天在安曼法庭又审讯了以从叙利亚偷运武器到约旦的莫须有罪名逮捕的二十七个人。法庭后来宣布休庭直到进一步通知，审讯经过没有透露。
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社伦敦3日讯：英国“观察家报”刊载驻安曼记者的一篇文章，报道约旦侯赛因政权摇摇欲坠。记者为了避免约旦当局的审查，不得不跑到塞浦路斯发回这篇文章。
    他列举材料说明侯赛因政权是靠英军驻扎约旦和警察镇压维持的。记者写道，西方外交人员估计，在约旦的阿拉伯军队中，约有一百五十名军官和下级军官因为有参与7月17日的未获成功的密谋的嫌疑而被投入监狱。
    记者最后说，许多外交人员认为，一旦英国军队撤走，侯赛因政权很快就会垮台。
    另据塞浦路斯尼科西亚3日消息：从约旦到达塞浦路斯的西方记者说，自从7月14日伊拉克发生政变以来，约旦国王侯赛因很少在公开场合露面。他每次离开筑在山顶上的王宫的时候，都有一支乘吉普车的由机关枪手和步兵组成的卫队护送。
