Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: According to TASS Moscow: The Soviet "Pravda" editorial today stated that hundreds of millions of people are watching the communiqué of the meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong, and the results of this meeting fill everyone who is loyal to the cause of peace and progress with confidence. Friends are happy, and enemies are sad! This is the evaluation of this meeting by the Soviet people, our Chinese friends, and the working people of all socialist countries.

This editorial, entitled "Great Cooperation in Maintaining Peace Interests," stated that the strength and power of the peace and socialist camp are infinite. Nearly one billion people, heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder, are advancing with iron-like strides towards the victory of our common cause. No force in the world can stop this irresistible tide.

The editorial stated that in all the cities and villages of the vast socialist camp countries, the working people unanimously expressed their support for the lofty ideas in the Sino-Soviet communiqué and their unwavering will to stop the dark forces of war. Anyone who is not blind or deaf cannot ignore the great role played by the socialist camp in modern world politics.

Peace-loving public opinion is extremely satisfied to welcome Comrade Khrushchev's and Comrade Mao Zedong's statement that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China will do everything possible to ease international tensions and prevent new war disasters. The vast majority of mankind fully agrees with the communiqué's strong condemnation of the United States and the United Kingdom's brutal aggression in the Middle East and fully supports the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China's demand that the United States and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. World public opinion believes that the following statement by the leaders of the Soviet Union and China is correct and timely: If the imperialist war maniacs dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people will unite closely to completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors and lay the foundation for lasting world peace. Western countries cannot close their eyes to the serious warning to war-mongering adventurers. It is no accident that the news of the meeting between Khrushchev and Mao Zedong immediately caused confusion and panic in the camp of the enemies of peace.

The editorial stated that the reactionary press is now using the habitual trick of slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in an attempt to distort the clear and unambiguous meaning of the Beijing communiqué. An Associated Press correspondent in Washington, reflecting the views of the American ruling circles, hypocritically complained that the Soviet Union and China "pursue a tough policy." Naturally, what the interventionists hope is that they can do dirty tricks as they please and hope that people will indulge them. This will not work, imperialist gentlemen! The fatal consequences of "appeasement" of the Hitler gang are still fresh in the minds of the people of all countries. The era when imperialist warlords could do whatever they wanted is gone forever.

The forces of peace are universally and unprecedentedly strong. They can inflict a devastating blow on reckless aggressors. If the war-mongers completely lose their minds and plunge mankind into the abyss of war, then they will inevitably be shattered against the copper walls and iron walls of the socialist camp with the support of all peace-loving countries and people.

    维护和平利益的伟大合作
    苏联“真理报”六日社论摘要
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”今天的社论说，亿万人民在注视着赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东的会谈公报，这次会谈的成果使每个忠于和平和进步事业的人充满信心。朋友高兴，敌人悲哀！这是苏联人、我们的中国朋友、一切社会主义国家的劳动人民对这次会谈的评价。
    这篇题为“维护和平利益的伟大合作”的社论说，和平和社会主义阵营的力量和威力是无穷无尽的。近十亿的人心连心、肩并肩地迈着铁一般的步伐，向着我们的共同事业胜利前进。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡这种不可遏止的潮流。
    社论说，在辽阔的社会主义阵营国家的一切城市和乡村，劳动人民都异口同声地表示一致支持苏中公报中的崇高思想和他们阻止战争黑暗势力的坚定不移的意志。谁要不是瞎子和聋子，谁就不能忽视社会主义阵营在现代世界政治中所起的伟大作用。
    爱好和平的舆论极其满意地欢迎赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志关于苏联和中华人民共和国将尽一切可能来缓和国际紧张局势和防止新战争灾难的声明。人类绝大多数都完全赞同公报中对美英两国在中近东的粗暴侵略行动的严厉谴责，并完全支持苏联和中华人民共和国要美国和英国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的要求。世界广大舆论认为，苏中两国领导人的下列声明是正确的和及时的，即：如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的持久和平。西方国家不能闭上眼睛不看对战争冒险狂人的严重警告。赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东会见的消息立即在和平的敌人的营垒中引起了混乱和惊慌，这不是偶然的。
    社论说，反动报刊现在施展出诽谤苏联和人民中国的惯技，企图歪曲北京公报清楚而明确的意义。美联社驻华盛顿记者反映美国统治集团的意见，虚伪地抱怨说，苏联和中国“执行强硬的政策”。自然，干涉者所希望的是，他们能为所欲为地干龌龊的勾当，希望人们能纵容他们。这是行不通的，帝国主义老爷们！对各国人民来说，希特勒匪帮的“绥靖”的致命后果记忆犹新。帝国主义军阀为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。
    和平力量普遍地空前壮大。他们能够给予轻举妄动的侵略者以毁灭性的打击。如果战争贩子完全丧失了理智，使人类陷入战争灾难的深渊，那末他们必将在得到一切爱好和平的国家和人民支持的社会主义阵营的铜墙铁壁上碰得头破血流。
