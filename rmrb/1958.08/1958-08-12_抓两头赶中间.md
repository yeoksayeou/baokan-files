Grasping Both Ends and Driving the Middle
　　Wang Pu
    It has only been about two months since the slogan "Take steel as the key link, the whole party and the whole people grasp steel" was put forward, and a high tide of running iron and steel industries in a big way has already formed nationwide. We can say with full confidence that it will not take long before a situation in which blast furnaces and converters bloom everywhere, and molten iron and molten steel flow everywhere will appear in many regions. At present, the general situation is that the production capacity of steelmaking and ironmaking has developed rapidly, while the development of ferrous metal mines, non-ferrous metal mines, coking plants, refractory material plants, and steel rolling mills has lagged behind somewhat. In some places, blast furnaces have been built, but there is a shortage of ore; the variety of steel is also insufficient, and it has not been rolled into steel in a timely manner. This means that the iron and steel industry has not yet formed a system.
    It is not surprising that the phenomenon of the middle (steelmaking and ironmaking) developing faster than the two ends (raw materials and finished products) has emerged in the development of the iron and steel industry. This is because in the process of development of any thing, some links always run ahead, and some links fall behind. As long as we take timely measures to continuously make the backward links catch up with the advanced links, we can promote the development of things by constantly breaking the old balance and establishing a new balance. What deserves attention at present is that this phenomenon of the middle being fast and the two ends being slow has not yet aroused widespread attention. Some places have only grasped the middle and have not simultaneously allowed the two ends to catch up.
    Why haven't the two ends attracted widespread attention? This is because some comrades have isolated steelmaking and ironmaking from the entire iron and steel industrial system, thinking that with blast furnaces and converters, they have everything. Everyone knows that anything in the universe has inherent connections with the surrounding things. They are mutually restraining and mutually promoting each other. We Marxists must not isolate any thing from the surrounding things in whatever we do. We must adopt the working method of grasping the main contradictions and bringing along the secondary contradictions, grasping the key points and bringing along the general, grasping both ends and driving the middle, or grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, in order to do things well. Taking the iron and steel industry as an example, steelmaking and ironmaking are only the two middle links in the entire industrial system. To make iron, there must be enough iron ore, coke, and ferroalloys; to make steel that meets the diverse needs of industry, there must be non-ferrous metals; after the steel is made, it must be rolled into various steel products. Therefore, in the development of the iron and steel industry, we must grasp both ends and drive the middle, that is, while building blast furnaces and converters, we must also build corresponding ferrous metal mines and non-ferrous metal mines, and we must build a series of factories and mines such as coking plants and steel rolling mills. Without simultaneously grasping both ends, the "middle" cannot advance alone. The Guangxi and Inner Mongolia regions reported in this newspaper today using the method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" to actively produce coke and refractory bricks is an important measure to ensure the great leap forward of the iron and steel industry.
    Grasping the middle and bringing along both ends or grasping both ends and bringing along the middle is an effective working method. If we learn to use this method, things will be done faster and better.

### 抓两头赶中间

　　抓两头赶中间
　　王朴
    “以钢为纲，全党全民抓钢”的口号提出不过才两个月左右，大办钢铁工业的高潮已经在全国范围内形成了。我们可以满怀信心地说，不用多长时间，高炉转炉遍地开花，铁水钢水到处奔流的局面，就将在很多地区出现。现在，总的情况是炼钢和炼铁的生产能力发展得很快，黑色金属矿山、有色金属矿山、炼焦厂、耐火材料厂和轧钢厂的发展有些跟不上。有些地方的高炉建设起来了，矿石不足；钢的品种也不够，而且又没有及时地轧制成钢材。这就是说钢铁工业还没有形成一个体系。
    钢铁工业发展中出现中间（炼钢和炼铁）快两头（原料和成品）跟不上的现象，是不足为奇的。因为任何事物在发展过程中，总有些环节跑在前面，有些环节落在后头。只要我们及时地采取措施，不断地使落后的环节赶上先进的环节，就可以在不断地打破旧的平衡、建立新的平衡中，促进事物的发展。当前值得注意的倒是这种中间快两头慢的现象，还没有引起人们的普遍重视，有些地方只抓了中间，没有同时让两头赶上去。
    为什么两头还没有引起人们的普遍重视呢？这是因为有些同志把炼钢和炼铁从整个钢铁工业体系中孤立起来，以为有了高炉和转炉就有了一切。殊不知宇宙间任何事物跟周围的事物都有着内在的联系，它们是互相约制着和互相促进着的。我们马克思主义者不论做什么事情，都不能把任何事物从周围的事物中孤立起来，都要采取抓主要矛盾带次要矛盾、抓重点带一般、抓两头赶中间或者抓两头带中间的工作方法，才能把事情办好。拿钢铁工业来说，炼钢和炼铁只不过是整个工业体系中的中间两个环节，要炼铁，还必须有足够的铁矿石、焦炭、铁合金；要炼出适合工业上多种多样需要的钢，就必须有有色金属；炼出了钢，还必须把它轧制成各种钢材。因此，在发展钢铁工业中，必须抓两头赶中间，即在建设高炉转炉的同时，还要相应地建设黑色金属矿山和有色金属矿山，要建设炼焦厂和轧钢厂等一系列的厂矿。不同时抓两头，“中间”是不能孤军跃进的。今天本报报道的广西、内蒙古等地用“土洋并举”的办法积极生产焦炭和耐火砖，就是保证钢铁工业大跃进的重要措施。
    抓中间带两头或者抓两头带中间都是一种有效的工作方法，我们学会运用这种方法，事情就会办得又快又好了。
