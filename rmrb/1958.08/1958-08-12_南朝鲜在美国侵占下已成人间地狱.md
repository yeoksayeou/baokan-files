　　South Korea Under US Occupation Has Become a Living Hell
　　Approximately one in five people are unemployed, and employed workers' wages are insufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living. 1.64 million farming households can only eat for two months of the year from their grain harvest after paying taxes. Hundreds of thousands of children wander the streets, begging door to door, and even resorting to theft.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 10th: Seoul report: In South Korea under the occupation of US imperialism, the broad masses of people are living in increasingly impoverished conditions due to economic bankruptcy, and are on the verge of starvation, disease, and death.

　　Under the impact of a tidal wave of US surplus goods, South Korea's industrial production is currently only half of what it was during the Japanese occupation period, and the vast majority of mines and large numbers of factories have recently been forced to shut down.

　　According to South Korean newspapers, the number of unemployed and underemployed people in South Korea currently exceeds 3.8 million, approximately one in five people. Even the wages of those who are employed are insufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living for a family. Even such low wages are often in arrears by the factory.

　　The lives of South Korean farmers are particularly difficult, as they bear more than 80% of the Lee Seung-man group's fiscal expenditure, which is mainly for military expansion and war preparation. According to a recent statistic in the South Korean "Finance" magazine, there are currently more than 2,218,000 farming households in South Korea, of which 1,640,000 are poor farmers with less than one chobu (approximately 15 mu) of cultivated land. After paying exorbitant taxes and levies, these poor farmers only have enough grain from their annual harvest to eat for two months. Therefore, more than 3 million farmers were without food this spring. 90% of farming households are in debt, with an average debt of 50,000 won per household, of which 81.8% is borrowed at high interest rates of two to three percent per month.

　　The lives of South Korean actors, artists, and writers are also very miserable. According to the "Dong-A Ilbo" newspaper, many theater troupes and musical groups have gone bankrupt. In order to eat, actors have to dance or play music in US military dance halls or general dance halls.

　　The situation of South Korean children is even more tragic. A large number of children are out of school and starving, and even resorting to theft. According to a recent report in the "Chosun Ilbo" newspaper, there are as many as 160,000 starving children in Gyeongsangnam-do alone. More than half of them can only eat two or one bowl of thin porridge a day. There are 200,000 orphans in South Korea who lost their parents in the war, and they wander the streets all day long, begging from door to door. (Attached picture)

　　南朝鲜在美国侵占下已成人间地狱
    大约每五个人当中就有一个失业者，就业工人工资不够维持最低生活。有一百六十四万户农民每年收获的谷物交税后只够食用两个月。几十万儿童徬徨街头，挨门要饭，甚至沦为盗贼。
    据新华社平壤10日电　汉城消息：在美帝国主义侵占下的南朝鲜，由于经济破产，广大人民生活日益贫困，他们已经濒于饥饿、疾病和死亡的境地。
    在潮水般的美国剩余商品的打击下，南朝鲜的工业生产目前只及日本统治时期的一半，绝大部分矿山和大批工厂最近都陷于停工。
    据南朝鲜报刊估计，目前南朝鲜失业和半失业的人数在三百八十万人以上，大约每五个人当中就有一个失业者。而就业的工人工资也难于维持一家最低生活。就连这样低的工资，厂方还经常拖欠不发。
    南朝鲜农民的生活尤其困苦，他们负担着李承晚集团以扩军备战为主的财政开支的80％以上。据南朝鲜“财政”杂志最近统计，目前南朝鲜共有二百二十一万八千多户农民，其中耕地不满一町步（约合十五市亩）的贫农有一百六十四万户。这些贫农每年收获的谷物，缴完苛捐杂税以后，只够食用两个月。因此，今春有三百多万个断粮农民。90％的农户负债，平均每户负债五万圆，其中81.8％是借的月息二分到三分的高利贷。
    南朝鲜的演员、艺术家和作家们的生活也是十分悲惨的。据“东亚日报”报道，许多剧团和音乐团体破产。演员们为了吃饭，不得不到美军舞场或一般舞场中去伴舞、伴奏。
    南朝鲜的儿童处境更加悲惨。大批儿童失学挨饿，甚至沦为盗贼。据“朝鲜日报”最近报道，光是庆尚南道就有十六万饥饿儿童。他们当中一半以上的人每天只能吃两顿或一顿稀粥。全南朝鲜有二十万名在战争中失去父母的孤儿，他们终日徬徨街头，挨门要饭。（附图片）
    南朝鲜劳动人民生活贫困，这里是在南朝鲜到处可见的“纸板屋”和狭窄的街道。南朝鲜的劳动人民就住在这里。　朝鲜中央通讯社稿（新华社发）
