    Organize Five-Level Cadres to Go Deep into the Fields

    The unprecedented bumper harvest this summer has inspired the vast number of farmers across the country to strive for an even greater harvest in the autumn. The agricultural collaboration conferences recently held in various collaboration areas across the country have all proposed specific measures to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest this year. The Northwest and Central South collaboration area conferences have also decided that cadres at all levels, from the province to the agricultural cooperative, will converge and go deep into the fields to vigorously grasp autumn field management. This is a strong guarantee for the realization of these measures.

    The current situation is that the major autumn crops in all provinces and regions across the country are generally growing well. If there are no major disasters, a comprehensive bumper harvest is expected. The enthusiasm of the peasant masses and the confidence of leaders at all levels are also growing, with the aim of achieving high yields for all kinds of crops and striving for a large-scale bumper harvest. The quality of field management work in the three months from now until the autumn harvest—August, September, and October—is the key to whether or not a greater comprehensive bumper harvest can be achieved in the autumn. The summer harvest was achieved by the vast number of cadres and farmers under the inspiration of the general line of socialist construction, bringing into play soaring enthusiasm, strengthening field management, overcoming various unfavorable natural conditions and pest and disease disasters. In the process of field management, visits and comparisons were organized, the two ends were grasped to bring along the middle, eliminating the three types of fields and three types of seedlings, improving the second types of fields and second types of seedlings, and grasping various management measures tightly until the harvest without slackening off. To achieve an even greater harvest in the autumn, the same needs to be done, and it needs to be done even better.

    The fact that the Central South provinces and regions and the Northwest provinces and regions are now organizing tens of thousands of cadres to go to the countryside is precisely to do a good job of autumn field management without relaxing for a moment in the three months of August, September, and October before the autumn harvest. The leading cadres and general cadres at the five levels of province (region), prefecture (autonomous prefecture), county, township, and cooperative will converge and go deep into the fields together with the vast number of activists of the agricultural cooperatives. This will greatly strengthen the Party's leadership over the current effort to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest, strengthen autumn field management and the planting of late rice and late autumn crops, and will also greatly strengthen the leadership in the widespread carrying out of agricultural tool reform and ball bearing work in rural areas. It will also strengthen the leadership in the mass accumulation of fertilizer and the widespread development of indigenous chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

    The current autumn field management is extremely tense. As with the situation before the summer harvest, rainfall is currently uneven in some areas. Drought is still quite serious in the Liaodong Peninsula, Shandong Peninsula, and southern Anhui in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In the Hua North and some areas in the southwest, there has been more heavy rain in the previous period. The southeast coast suffered a typhoon attack in July, and there is still the possibility of being attacked by typhoons in the future. Pests and diseases of autumn crops in various places have occurred one after another under conditions of prolonged drought and excessive flooding, and some areas are still more serious. Due to the tension of rural labor in the Great Leap Forward, if the work of cultivating and weeding autumn fields is not grasped tightly, weed infestation and soil compaction will occur. Currently, the phenomenon of weed infestation has already occurred in some autumn fields in some rainy areas of Hebei and Henan. There are also some places that currently feel there is a shortage of quick-acting fertilizer for topdressing autumn fields and pesticides for pest control. If all of these are not properly handled and resolved in a timely manner, they will affect this year's comprehensive bumper harvest. The summer harvest proves that under the leadership of the Party, and with the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses in the Great Leap Forward, we can overcome any difficulties and achieve a bumper harvest. Many areas have issued the bold statement that "we will have a bumper harvest even if it doesn't rain all year." But this must be guaranteed with practical measures. The weather in summer changes extremely quickly; drought and flood disasters are difficult to completely avoid. Crops grow rapidly and urgently need water and fertilizer; weeds grow quickly, and pests occur and spread quickly. A slight oversight often causes irreparable losses. Therefore, the leadership of autumn field management cannot be relaxed for a moment.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the leadership work on agricultural production in various places has been further deepened. There has been a great leap forward in leadership methods. Cadres going deep into the fields, county Party committees working in the countryside, cadres planting experimental fields, etc., have all further closely combined leadership and practice, leadership and the masses. Five-level or six-level cadres converging and going deep into the fields, organizing large-scale inspections, comparisons, and competitions together with the broad masses of peasants in the important season of production, achieving specific leadership over production through being in the fields and with the peasants, and promptly discovering and solving problems, and constantly enriching the experience of cadres at all levels in leading agricultural production in the process of combining with the masses. Such a large-scale organization of cadres to go deep into the fields is a new development of this leadership method of combining leadership with the masses, which can more powerfully bring into play the Party's leadership role in agricultural production. This spring, all provinces organized large-scale inspection teams to go deep into every township and cooperative to conduct inspections, which played a major role in promptly discovering and solving problems, strengthening field management, and ensuring the summer harvest. The problems of drought prevention, flood prevention, wind prevention, and insect prevention in autumn field management can only be solved thoroughly and in a timely manner in this way. Large-scale and regular in-depth visits to the fields by leading cadres will further inspire the enthusiasm of the masses to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

    The further leap forward in agricultural production requires further improvement in the level of leadership work. Many current problems in autumn field management, such as the arrangement and organization of labor, the organization of shock work, the rapid promotion of improved agricultural tools to improve efficiency, and the timely reliance on the masses to overcome the difficulties of insufficient fertilizer and pesticides, must be solved on the spot in the fields by the leadership and the masses together. The practice of leading agricultural production in the office is long gone. In the future, during the tense periods of agricultural activities, such as spring plowing and sowing, summer harvesting and planting, and autumn harvesting and sowing, it is very necessary to organize five-level or six-level cadres to converge, go deep into the fields for a longer period of time, strengthen leadership, inspection, and evaluation. With five levels of leading cadres together, not only is the leadership greatly strengthened, but the back-and-forth circulation of requests for instructions and reports can undoubtedly be avoided. The convergence of cadres from various systems other than the industrial system in the countryside will further enable the forces of all aspects to better serve the development of agricultural production under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and to better concentrate the forces of all aspects to jointly strive to realize the political task of a bumper harvest in the autumn.

    This year's summer harvest and early rice harvest have already increased grain production by more than 80 billion catties, which is a rate of agricultural production growth that has never been seen before in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. The realization of a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture this year will more powerfully promote a comprehensive and greater leap forward in China's socialist construction cause.

### 组织五级干部深入田间

    组织五级干部深入田间
    今年夏季空前大丰收鼓舞了全国广大农民争取秋季更大丰收的干劲。全国各协作区最近分别举行的农业协作会议，会上都提出了争取今年全面大丰收的具体措施。西北、中南两个协作区会议还决定了从省到农业社各级干部会师，深入田间，狠狠地抓秋田管理工作。这是实现这些措施的有力保证。
    当前的形势是全国各省区的大秋作物普遍生长良好，如果没有特大的灾害，可望获得全面的大丰收。农民群众的干劲，各级领导的信心，也越来越大，对各种农作物都要争取高额丰产，要争取大面积的丰收。而从现在到秋收即八、九、十三个月的田间管理工作做得好坏，是能不能取得秋季更大的全面丰收的关键。夏季丰收是广大干部和农民在建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，发挥冲天干劲，加强田间管理，克服各种不利的自然条件和病虫灾害而取得的；是在田间管理的过程中，组织参观评比，抓两头带中间，消灭三类田、三类苗，提高二类田、二类苗，随时查田查苗，抓紧各项管理措施，一直到收获以前都不松劲，才取得空前大丰收的。要争取秋季更大的丰收，同样需要作到这些，而且需要作得更好。
    中南各省区和西北各省区现在组织成万的干部下乡，就是为了在秋收以前八、九、十三个月中，一刻也不放松地做好秋田的管理工作。省（区）、地（自治州）、县、乡、社五级的领导干部和一般干部，同农业社的广大积极分子在一起，会师深入田间，这将大大地加强党对当前争取全面大丰收的领导，加强秋田的管理工作和晚稻、晚秋作物的种插工作；也将大大地加强各地农村大搞农具改革，大搞滚珠轴承工作的领导；加强对于突击积肥运动，对于普遍开展土制化学肥料和农药工作的领导。
    当前的秋田管理是万分紧张的。和夏收以前的情况一样，目前部分地区雨水并不调匀。辽东半岛、山东半岛和长江下游安徽南部等地区的旱象还相当严重；华北、西南部分地区前一个时期暴雨较多；东南沿海在7月间遭受了一次台风的袭击，今后仍有遭受台风袭击的可能；各地秋作物的病害虫害在久旱多涝的情况下，都已相继发生，有的地区还较严重。而由于大跃进中农村劳力紧张，秋田的中耕除草工作稍为抓不紧就要发生草荒、板结的现象。目前河北、河南部分多雨地区，少数秋田的草荒现象已经发生。还有一些地方目前感到为秋田追肥的速效肥料和除治害虫的农药不足。所有这些如不予以妥善处理，及时解决，都会影响今年的全面大丰收。夏季的丰收证明，大跃进中在党的领导下，在广大群众的冲天干劲下，我们能够战胜任何困难取得大丰收。不少地区发出了“一年不下雨也要丰收”的豪语。但是这必须要有切实的措施才能保证。夏季的天气变化极快，旱涝灾害，难以完全避免，而农作物生长迅速，需水需肥迫切；草长得快，虫害发生和蔓延也快，稍一疏忽往往造成不可挽救的损失。因此，秋田管理的领导一刻也不能放松。
    大跃进以来，各地对农业生产的领导工作进一步深入了。领导方法有很大跃进，干部深入田间，县委下乡办公，干部种试验田等等都使领导和实际、领导和群众有了进一步的紧密结合。五级或六级干部会师深入田间，在生产的重要季节，每个省组织成万的干部，和广大农民一起组织大规模的检查、评比、竞赛，通过在田间和农民一起来实现对于生产的具体领导，作到及时地发现问题和解决问题；并且在和群众结合的过程中间不断地丰富各级干部对于领导农业生产的经验。这样大规模地组织干部深入田间，是领导与群众相结合的这一领导方法的新发展，它可以更强有力地发挥党对于农业生产的领导作用。今年春天，各省都组织了大规模的检查团，深入到每一个乡、社进行检查，这对于及时发现和解决问题，加强田间管理，保证夏季丰收起了重大作用。秋季田间管理工作，防旱、防涝、防风、防虫等问题也只有这样才能及时地彻底地解决。领导干部大规模经常深入田间，更将进一步鼓舞群众争取全面大丰收的干劲。
    农业生产的进一步跃进要求进一步提高领导工作水平。当前秋田管理的许多问题，如劳力的安排和组织协作、组织突击，迅速推广改良农具以提高效率，及时依靠群众自力克服肥料和农药不足的困难，这些问题都必须领导和群众一起，在田间就地解决。在办公室里领导农业生产的做法是早已过去了。今后在农事活动的紧张时期，如春耕春播、夏收夏种、秋收秋种时期，组织五级或六级干部会师，较长期间地深入田间，加强领导、检查评比是非常必要的。五级的领导干部在一起，不仅把领导大大地加强了，无疑地可以避免请示报告的往返周转。除工业系统以外其他各系统的干部在农村会师，将进一步在党委统一领导下，使各方面的力量更好地为发展农业生产而服务，更好地集中各方面的力量共同为实现秋季大丰收这一政治任务而努力。
    今年夏季丰收和早稻丰收已经增产了八百多亿斤粮食，这是古今中外从来没有过的农业生产增长的速度。今年农业的全面大丰收的实现，将更有力地推动我国社会主义建设事业全面地更大跃进。
