　　Sanatorium Resident Also Manages Books

　　Next to the workshop of the "August 1st Production Group" is a very small room with a sign reading "Library" hanging at the door. Inside, there are more than 500 books on the bookshelves. A young man sits at the table, carefully compiling book numbers and sorting books.

　　Every day after work, the workers crowd into this small room. Some borrow books, some listen to the librarian introduce the contents of the books, but more people like to listen to him talk about major events at home and abroad.

　　People who don't know the situation may wonder: Why are all the workers participating in production women, but the librarian is a man? It turns out that this comrade is named Xu Dapeng. He is the chief train attendant of the Beijing Train Section of the Beijing Railway Administration. Because he has pulmonary tuberculosis, the organization decided that he should go home to recuperate. However, in these days when one day is equal to twenty years, who can be idle? (Zhang Fu)

　　休养员也来管图书
    在“八一生产组”车间的旁边，有一间很小的房子，门口挂着“图书馆”的牌子，里面书架上约有五百多本书。一位年青的男同志坐在桌旁，在精心地编书号，整理着书籍。
    每到下班以后，工人们便挤满了这间小屋子，有借书的，有听这位图书管理员介绍书的内容的，但更多的人则喜欢听他讲国内外的大事。
    不了解情况的人，或许会怀疑：为什么参加生产的工人都是妇女，管理图书的却是一位男同志呢？原来这位同志叫徐大鹏，他是北京铁路管理局北京列车段的主任列车员，因为他有肺结核，组织上决定他回家休养。但是，在这一天等于二十年的日子里，谁能够闲着呢？（张夫）
