　　Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd -- The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) submitted its eighth interim report to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on July 5th. The report reviewed the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam from May 1, 1957, to April 30, 1958.

　　After describing the implementation of the provisions concerning the Demilitarized Zone, the report pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities had consistently refused to participate in the Joint Commission, and therefore, the activities of the Joint Commission had not been restored to date. This has hindered the implementation of the Geneva Accords in the Demilitarized Zone. During the period covered by the report, the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army filed sixty-two accusations through the Commission against the South Vietnamese authorities for violating the provisions concerning the Demilitarized Zone. The Commission has ascertained that the South Vietnamese authorities unilaterally issued permits to enter the Demilitarized Zone without a decision by the Joint Commission and has pointed out to the South Vietnamese authorities that this action violates the agreement.

　　The report also pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities violated Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords regarding "no reprisals or discrimination against individuals and organizations for their activities during the period of hostilities, and to guarantee their democratic freedoms," and obstructed the Commission's investigation. During the period covered by the report, the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army filed eighty-seven accusations against the South Vietnamese authorities for violating the above provisions. The Commission has determined that the South Vietnamese authorities violated the agreement in fourteen cases and requested the South Vietnamese authorities to release the victims, but the South Vietnamese authorities refused to comply. The South Vietnamese authorities also refused to respond to two hundred and four cases. When the Commission wanted to send a group to investigate, the South Vietnamese authorities also disagreed. The Commission has decided to notify the participating countries of the Geneva Conference that the South Vietnamese authorities not only do not implement the Commission's recommendations but also obstruct the Commission's supervisory activities.

　　Regarding the implementation of Articles 16 and 17 concerning prohibitions on the introduction of new troops, new military personnel, weapons, ammunition, and the establishment of military bases, the report stated that the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army filed seventy-six accusations through the Commission against the South Vietnamese authorities for violating the above provisions. Regarding the issue of the United States violating the Geneva Accords by establishing various American military institutions in South Vietnam—such as the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," the "Temporary Equipment Reconditioning Team," the "Training, Organization, and Inspection Team," and the "Combat, Weapons, and Training Organization"—although the Commission has repeatedly inquired with the South Vietnamese authorities for a long time, the South Vietnamese authorities not only do not provide sufficient information but also stated that it is impossible to foresee when these Americans will end their activities.

　　The report pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities not only violated the agreement but also obstructed the Commission's supervisory activities. The Commission's mobile personnel in five locations, including Toulon, Qui Nhon, and Nha Trang, are still unable to go out for supervisory activities. When military aircraft land in Saigon, the South Vietnamese authorities do not allow the Commission to inspect the materials carried by the aircraft. Sometimes, the South Vietnamese authorities do not report the entry of military aircraft into Saigon to the Commission at all, or directly land the military aircraft at military airports to evade the Commission's supervision. The Commission had requested the South Vietnamese authorities to change their attitude and provide the necessary assistance to the Commission, but the South Vietnamese authorities did not agree.

　　The report stated that the South Vietnamese authorities submitted a request to the Commission to "replace" the weapons, ammunition, and combat materials carried out by the French army when it withdrew from South Vietnam. The Polish Commissioner in the Commission opposed this request. Finally, the Commission decided to accept the request of the South Vietnamese authorities by a vote of two to one. The Commission has a special report on this issue.

　　The report concluded that because the activities of the Joint Commission have not been restored, the two sides have not yet consulted on the issue of Vietnam's reunification. The Commission believes that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the participating countries have already noted this situation. The Commission expressed its willingness to work to restore the activities of the Joint Commission and to continue to do its utmost to maintain peace in Vietnam in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The Commission expressed concern about the South Vietnamese authorities obstructing the Commission's supervisory activities on many occasions. The report concluded that if this trend is allowed to develop, it will prevent the Commission from fulfilling its responsibilities.

　　越南国际委员会提出临时报告
    南越当局目无国际法纪
    屡屡违反非军事区条款阻挠国际委员会活动
    新华社22日讯　越南国际监察和监督委员会（以下简称委员会）7月5日向日内瓦会议两位主席提交了第八次临时报告。报告回顾了自从1957年5月1日到1958年4月30日期间日内瓦协议在越南实施的情况。
    报告在叙述了关于非军事区条款的实施情况后指出，南越当局一直拒绝参加联合委员会，因此，联合委员会的活动至今未能恢复。这就妨害了日内瓦协议在非军事区的实施。在报告涉及的期间，越南人民军总司令部前后六十二次通过委员会指控南越当局违反关于非军事区的条款。委员会已经查明南越当局未经联合委员会的决定就擅自签发进入非军事区的特许证，并且已经向南越当局指出，这种行动违反了协议。
    报告还指出，南越当局违反日内瓦协定十四条丙款关于“不因个人和团体，在敌对行动期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由”的规定，并且阻挠委员会进行调查。在报告期间，越南人民军总司令部先后八十七次指控南越当局违反上述规定。委员会已经确定南越当局在十四个案件中违反了协议，并且要求南越当局释放受害人员，但是南越当局拒不执行。南越当局还对二百零四个案件拒不答复。当委员会要派小组调查时，南越当局也不同意。委员会已经决定通知日内瓦会议与会各国，南越当局不但不执行委员会的建议，而且阻挠委员会的监督活动。
    关于第十六、十七条有关禁止进入新的军队、新的军事人员、武器弹药和建立军事基地的规定的实施情况，报告说，越南人民军总司令部七十六次通过委员会指控南越当局违反上述规定。关于美国违反日内瓦协议在南越设立各种美国军事机构——诸如“军事援助顾问团”、“临时装备翻新团”、“训练、组织、视察团”和“战斗、武器、训练组织”——的问题，虽然委员会久已一再询问南越当局，但是南越当局不但不提供充分情况，而且表示这些美国人何时结束其活动是不可能预见的。
    报告指出，南越当局不但违反协议，而且阻挠委员会的监督活动。委员会在土伦、归仁、芽庄等五地的机动人员至今仍然不能出外进行监督活动。在军用飞机在西贡降落时，南越当局不准委员会视察飞机所载运的物资，有时，南越当局根本不向委员会报告军用飞机进入西贡，或是直接把军用飞机降落在军用机场以逃避委员会的监督。委员会已经要求南越当局改变态度，给委员会以必要的协助，但是南越当局不予同意。
    报告说，南越当局向委员会提出，要求“替换”法国军队撤出南越时所携出的武器弹药和作战物资。委员会中的波兰委员对这个要求持反对态度，最后，委员会以两票对一票决议接受南越当局的要求。关于这一问题，委员会另有特别报告。
    报告的结论说，由于联合委员会的活动一直没有恢复，因此，双方仍未就越南的统一问题进行协商。委员会相信，日内瓦会议两主席和与会各国都已经注意到了这一情况。委员会表示愿为恢复联合委员会的活动而努力，并且继续根据日内瓦协议的规定竭尽全力来维护越南的和平。委员会对南越当局在许多场合下阻挠委员会的监督活动表示忧虑。报告结论还指出，如果听任这种趋势发展下去，将使委员会不能执行其职责。
