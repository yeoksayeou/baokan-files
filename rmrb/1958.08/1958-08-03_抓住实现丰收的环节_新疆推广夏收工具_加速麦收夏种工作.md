Grasp the Key to Achieving a Bumper Harvest
Xinjiang Promotes Summer Harvesting Tools to Accelerate Wheat Harvesting and Summer Planting

    (Our report) The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are taking a fighting stance to make a concentrated effort in summer harvesting, seize the time for replanting, and strengthen the management of autumn fields, striving for an all-round bumper harvest of 30 million mu of crops.
    After a hard winter-spring and summer battle, the people of the Autonomous Region have achieved high yields on more than 11 million mu of winter and spring wheat and more than 1.8 million mu of oil crops. It is estimated that the oil crops can be more than self-sufficient, and the wheat output can increase sharply by 900 million jin on the basis of more than 1.7 billion jin last year.
    In order to ensure a bumper harvest of wheat, before the wheat harvest in July, various parts of the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains manufactured and promoted tens of thousands of summer harvesting tools and transportation equipment. The prefectures in southern Xinjiang, where the wheat harvest started earlier, basically ended in mid-July, generally achieving simultaneous cutting, transporting, and replanting. The backward method of one year's crops being threshed over two years, and groups of cattle treading on the wheat to thresh, which had been left over for thousands of years, has been fundamentally changed after the promotion of tens of thousands of stone rollers. In various parts of northern Xinjiang, the progress of the wheat harvest, which started in mid-July, has also been exceptionally rapid due to the sufficient preparation of summer harvesting tools. In the directly administered counties of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture alone, more than 60,000 new-style summer harvesting tools have been prepared this year.
    The rapid progress of the wheat harvest has provided conditions for a large amount of replanting. Last year, the replanting area in the Autonomous Region was only more than 1.4 million mu, but this year it can reach more than 3 million mu (including 1 million mu of green manure), and farmers of all ethnic groups will recover 400 million jin of grain from the land where winter wheat has yielded a bumper harvest.
    According to recent inspections in various places, the more than 14 million mu of autumn fields sown in the Autonomous Region this year are also generally growing better than in previous years. Among them, the area of food crops such as rice, corn, and sorghum is nearly 10 million mu (excluding replanting), and the total output has exceeded the wheat output in previous years. This year, various parts of the Autonomous Region have broken with backward farming habits and strengthened field management, and the output of autumn fields will be even higher than in previous years.

    抓住实现丰收的环节
    新疆推广夏收工具  加速麦收夏种工作
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各族农民正以战斗的姿态突击夏收、抓紧复播、加强秋田管理工作，力争三千万亩农作物全面丰收。
    自治区人民经过苦战一冬春和一夏，一千一百多万亩冬春小麦和一百八十多万亩油料作物均获丰产。预计油料可以自给有余，小麦产量可在去年十七亿多斤的基础上猛增九亿斤。
    为了保证小麦丰产丰收，7月麦收以前，天山南北各地制造和推广了数以万计的夏收农具和运输工具。麦收较早的南疆各专区7月中旬基本结束，普遍做到了随割、随运、随复播。千百年来遗留下来的一年庄稼两年打，群牛踩麦打场的落后方法，在推广了成千上万个石磙以后得到了根本的改变。北疆各地，由于夏收农具准备得充分，从7月中旬开始的麦收工作进展也异常迅速。光是伊犁哈萨克族自治州的直属县，今年准备的新式夏收农具就有六万多件。
    麦收工作进展迅速为大量复播提供了条件。去年自治区复播面积只有一百四十多万亩，今年则可以达到三百多万亩（包括一百万亩绿肥），各族农民要从冬麦丰收过的土地上再夺回四亿斤粮食。
    根据最近各地检查，自治区今年播种的一千四百多万亩秋田也普遍比往年生长得好。其中水稻、玉米、高粱等粮食面积将近一千万亩（不包括复播），历年总产都超过了小麦产量。今年自治区各地打破了落后的耕作习惯，加强了田间管理，秋田产量更会超过往年。
