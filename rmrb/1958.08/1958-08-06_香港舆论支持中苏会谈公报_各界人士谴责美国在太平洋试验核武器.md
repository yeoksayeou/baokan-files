Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 5th. Hong Kong newspaper editorials support the communiqué of the Sino-Soviet leaders' meeting.

The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" published an editorial today entitled "A Meeting Concerning the Fate of Mankind," saying that the attitudes of China and the Soviet Union have a decisive effect on the development of the world situation.

The Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" believes that the communiqué of the Sino-Soviet leaders' meeting shines like the morning sun in every corner of the world, making all those who support justice and demand peace happy and encouraging them to work hard with full confidence.

The Hong Kong "New Evening Post" pointed out in its commentary on the 4th that China and the Soviet Union, with one-third of the world's population, are an invincible and decisive force. Therefore, the meeting of the leaders of the two countries has an immeasurable impact on the overall situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 5th. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong are angrily condemning the United States for testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific and deliberately contaminating the air in the southeastern coastal areas of China with radioactive dust.

Wu Da-biao, former president of the Hong Kong Chinese Medical Association, appealed to peace-loving people all over the world and demanded that people unite to stop this inhumane criminal act by the United States.

In the past three days, bus workers, dockworkers, tram workers, foreign affairs workers, motorcycle workers, enamelware workers, and milk company workers in Hong Kong have held seminars to strongly condemn the inhumane atrocities of the United States.

Well-known figures in Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles, Liang Canhui, Zhuang Chengzong, Deng Dianchu, Zhao Aihua, Huang Yanqing, and many bookstore managers, school teachers, film workers, lawyers, and medical professionals questioned: If the hydrogen bombs tested by the United States are really as "clean" as they say, why not test them on American soil?
