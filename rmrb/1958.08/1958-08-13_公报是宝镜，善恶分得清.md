    The Communiqué is a Magic Mirror, Distinguishing Good from Evil (Three-stick Drum)
    National Folk Art Performance Troupe of Hubei Province, Guo Hua
　　Radiance shoots up to the clouds, red flags flutter in the sky,
　　Chinese and Soviet leaders meet in conference,
　　A communiqué is issued in Beijing.
　　The communiqué is like the sun, shining in all directions,
　　The people of the world feel enlightened,
　　War-mongers are panic-stricken.
　　The communiqué is full of heroic spirit, surpassing ten thousand cannons,
　　Eight hundred million people are the gunners,
　　The imperialists are scared out of their wits.
　　The communiqué is powerful, like a flood-blocking dam,
　　War-mongers ride broken boats,
　　Crash against the dam and the boats are wrecked.
　　The communiqué is like a satellite, spreading good news everywhere,
　　Peace satellites fly around the globe,
　　People of the world have confidence in defending peace.
　　The communiqué is a magic mirror, distinguishing good from evil,
　　The imperialists' evil schemes,
　　Are revealed in their true form when they see the magic mirror.

    公报是宝镜，善恶分得清（三棒鼓）
    全国曲艺会演湖北代表团　郭化霞光冲云霄，红旗满天飘，中苏领袖来会谈，北京城里发公报。公报像太阳，光芒照四方，全世界人民心里亮，战争贩子着了慌。公报气势豪，赛过万门炮，八亿人民是炮手，帝国主义魂吓掉。公报气势大，像座拦洪坝，战争贩子乘破船，碰在坝上船就垮。公报像卫星，到处传福音，和平卫星飞全球，世界人民保卫和平有信心。公报是宝镜，善恶分得清，帝国主义鬼阴谋，见了宝镜现原形。
