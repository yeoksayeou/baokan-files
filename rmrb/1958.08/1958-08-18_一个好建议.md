　　A Good Suggestion
    The train sped forward, everyone was happy, except for an old lady sitting across from me who looked worried, which made me uncomfortable too. It turned out that she was going to Baoding to find her daughter, but she lost the letter. She didn't remember the address, only her daughter's name. Her son-in-law was a worker, and she didn't know anything else. I tried many ways to help her find her, but to no avail.
    I helped the worried old lady off the train and immediately saw an "Information Service." It turned out that residents over the age of eighteen could have their address looked up as long as you knew their name. In less than two minutes, the old lady's daughter's address was found, and she smiled and parted ways with me. This kind of work method is worth promoting.

　　一个好建议
    火车向前奔驰着，每个人都是高高兴兴，只有我对面坐着的一个老太太愁眉苦脸，引得我也跟着不舒服。原来她是到保定找女儿，但把信丢了，他又没记住地址，只知道女儿的名字，女婿是个工人，别的什么也不知道。我想了不少办法帮她寻找，终归无效。
    我扶着这位愁眉苦脸的老太太下了火车，一眼就看见有个“询人服务处”，原来十八岁以上的居民，只要知道姓名就能查着地址。没有两分钟，老太太的女儿的住址查着了，她笑着和我分手了。这种工作方法，值得推广。
