    Reading the Inaugural Issue of "International Cinema"
    Su Fang
    I finished reading the inaugural issue of "International Cinema" with joy. I think that compared with its predecessor, "Film Art Translations," it is richer and more diverse in both content and form.

    Over the past few years, "Film Art Translations" has done a lot of work in introducing foreign, especially Soviet, advanced film art theories and practical experiences, providing many materials for our film art workers to study and refer to. However, due to the lack of due research on the problems in our film art practice, its introduction work cannot better meet the needs of the masses; in particular, the objective and uncritical introduction of some remarks with erroneous viewpoints has caused a bad influence among readers. Now, it can be seen from the inaugural message of "International Cinema" that it has noticed these shortcomings. It indicates that in the future, it will focus on and promptly introduce remarks that can be combined with the actual situation of our socialist construction and the actual situation of our film art creation; at the same time, in order to attract more amateur authors to participate in film art work and expand the film art creation team, it will strive to be more mass-oriented in terms of both writing style and content, so that more readers can accept it. Under the guidance of such a policy, it is foreseeable that the introduction work of "International Cinema" will definitely make better achievements.

    The inaugural issue of "International Cinema" publishes a variety of things: there are film literary scripts, there are reviews, there are situation introductions, and there are also news reports; among them, in addition to translated articles, there are also reviews and impressions written by our literary workers and film workers. The inaugural issue focuses on introducing two excellent Soviet films, "Stories about Lenin" and "A Communist." Regarding "Stories about Lenin," there is Gavrilovich's film literary script, Lin Ling's "Reading 'Stories about Lenin,'" Paramonova's "Pages of a Great Life," and a short article by the film director Yutkevich on the creative process. Lin Ling's article makes a simple and clear analysis of the film literary script "Stories about Lenin," explaining that the characteristic of this work lies in reflecting the ideological style of this immortal revolutionary giant and his inexhaustible vitality through the depiction of Lenin's daily life. Paramonova's article talks about the achievements of the film "Stories about Lenin" and the new creation of the actor Straukh, who played Lenin (he also played Lenin in films such as "The Man with the Gun"). Regarding "A Communist," there is "What the Film Fights For," which talks about the film's creative intention, Shi Lianxing's "Talking about the Image of Gubanov," and actor Urbansky's talk about his feelings of playing the protagonist Gubanov, and so on. Reading these articles enables us to have a relatively deep understanding of the political significance of these two films and their artistic achievements.

    In the news documentary film column of the inaugural issue of "International Cinema," there are articles reviewing the Soviet widescreen documentary film "We Are Under the Same Sky" and the Czechoslovak documentary "Underground Struggle," which respectively elaborate on how news documentaries should select the most important events from a multitude of complex events, and the significance of faithfully representing the lives and struggles of modern people in news documentaries. And the "Talking about Ivens' New Film 'Paris on the Seine'" written by the famous French film critic Georges Sadoul can be said to be a lyrical essay with profound meaning, which shows the joys and hardships of film art workers in creation, and is also imbued with the close and intimate friendship between Sadoul and Ivens, these two artistic masters. In order to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of the Soviet film art master Eisenstein and the fifth anniversary of the death of Pudovkin, the inaugural issue published several short articles written by them in different periods. These short articles show that as outstanding artists, Eisenstein and Pudovkin are first and foremost revolutionary and Party artists. This will undoubtedly play a role of spurring and encouraging our film art workers.

    The inaugural issue of "International Cinema" also introduces the film industry situation of some socialist countries and capitalist countries with considerable length. The two form a sharp contrast, with the film industry in socialist countries rising steadily; the film industry in capitalist countries is taking a dangerous path of decline! In addition, the inaugural issue also introduces well-known film figures, and reflects and reports on the dynamics of the world's film industry in the columns International Film News and Around the World.

    In the situation where the socialist construction cause is changing with each passing day, my country's film industry is also striding forward. The publication of "International Cinema" is a happy event in the great leap forward of the film industry. However, the only fly in the ointment is that there are too many typos in the inaugural issue.

    读“国际电影”创刊号
    苏方
    我怀着欣喜的心情读完了“国际电影”创刊号。我觉得，它和它的前身“电影艺术译丛”相比，无论在内容或形式上，都要丰富多样一些。
    几年来，“电影艺术译丛”在介绍国外的、特别是苏联的先进电影艺术理论和实际经验方面，做了不少工作，为我国电影艺术工作者提供了许多可供学习和参考的材料；但是，由于对于我国电影艺术实践中的问题缺乏应有的研究，它的介绍工作还不能更好地满足群众的需要；特别是客观地、无批判地介绍了一些具有错误观点的言论，更在读者中造成不好的影响。现在，从“国际电影”的发刊词中可以看出，它已经注意到了这些缺点。它表明今后将着重和及时介绍的，是能够结合我国社会主义建设的实际、结合我国电影艺术创作的实际的言论；同时，为了吸引更多的业余作者参加电影艺术工作，扩大电影艺术创作队伍，它无论在文字风格和内容方面，都要力求更加富于群众性，使更多的读者能够接受。在这样的方针的指导下，可以预见，“国际电影”的介绍工作一定会做出更好的成绩来。
    “国际电影”创刊号刊登了多种类型的东西：有电影文学剧本，有评论，有情况介绍，也有消息；其中除了翻译的文章外，也有我国文学工作者和电影工作者撰写的评论和观感。创刊号着重介绍了苏联的两部优秀影片“列宁的故事”和“一个共产党员”。关于“列宁的故事”，有格布里罗维奇的电影文学剧本，林陵的“读‘列宁的故事’”，巴拉蒙诺娃的“伟大生活的几页”，以及影片导演尤特凯维奇的谈创作经过的短文。林陵的文章对于电影文学剧本“列宁的故事”作了浅近明了的分析，说明这部作品的特点，在于通过对列宁日常生活的描写，反映出了这位不朽的革命巨人的思想风貌，和他所具有的永不涸竭的生命力。巴拉蒙诺娃的文章谈到了影片“列宁的故事”的成就，以及扮演列宁的演员史特拉乌赫的新的创造（他曾在“带枪的人”等影片中扮演过列宁）。关于“一个共产党员”，有谈影片创作意图的“影片为什么而斗争”，有石联星的“谈古班诺夫的形象”，有演员乌尔班斯基谈扮演主角古班诺夫的感受的谈话等。读了这些文章，使我们能比较深入地认识和理解这两部影片的政治意义和它们的艺术成就。
    “国际电影”创刊号的新闻纪录电影专栏内，有评论苏联宽银幕纪录影片“我们在一个天空下”和捷克斯洛伐克纪录片“地下的战斗”的文章，分别对新闻纪录片如何从纷繁庞多的事件中，选取最主要的事件，以及新闻纪录片中忠实地表现现代人的生活和斗争的意义等作了阐述。而法国著名电影评论家乔治·萨杜尔所写的“谈伊文思的新片‘塞纳河畔的巴黎’”，则可以说是一篇意味隽永的抒情散文，其中显示了电影艺术工作者创作中的甘苦，也浸润着萨杜尔和伊文思这两位艺术大师的亲密无间的友情。为了纪念苏联电影艺术大师爱森斯坦逝世十周年，普多夫金逝世五周年，创刊号上发表了他们在不同时期内所写的几篇短文。这些短文表明，作为杰出的艺术家，爱森斯坦和普多夫金首先是革命的、党的艺术家。这对我们的电影艺术工作者来说，无疑会起着鞭策和激励的作用。
    “国际电影”创刊号还以相当篇幅介绍了一些社会主义国家和资本主义国家的电影事业状况。二者形成了鲜明的对比，社会主义国家的电影事业正在蒸蒸日上；资本主义国家的电影事业却在走着危险的没落的道路！此外，创刊号上还介绍了知名的电影人物，并且在专栏国际电影动态和在世界各地中，反映报道了世界各国电影动态。
    在社会主义建设事业日新月异的形势中，我国的电影事业也在大步向前迈进，“国际电影”的创刊便是电影事业大跃进中出现的一桩喜事。不过美中不足的是创刊号上的错字太多。
