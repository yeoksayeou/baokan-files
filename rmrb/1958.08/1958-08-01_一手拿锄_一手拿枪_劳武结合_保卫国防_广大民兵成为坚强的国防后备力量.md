Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The tens of millions of militiamen across the country with a glorious history of struggle, have become a powerful reserve force for national defense with organization, discipline, awareness, and a certain level of military skills and combat capabilities after several years of military and political training that "combines labor and military affairs." They have become a powerful assistant to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in defending the coast, borders, and consolidating internal security.

This powerful mass armed force, with the strength of the country's socialist construction and armed forces, has progressed from red-tasseled spears, earthen guns, and earthen cannons to the use of rifles, submachine guns, machine guns, small-caliber artillery, and anti-aircraft firearms. It has grown from 5.5 million in 1950 to a mass armed organization spread throughout the country, and has established a close joint defense network between villages and townships, ensuring that "if something happens in one place, the surrounding villages and towns will come to support." This year, in the training of "holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other," there has emerged a wave of enthusiasm for learning: "The rooster crows before dawn, and large and small villages train together" and "A hoe in one hand, a gun in the other, the fields and wasteland become training grounds, the hoe opens up thousands of acres, and training with guns defends the country." Across the country, through various "labor-military combination" training methods such as "learn less when busy, learn more when less busy; train less on sunny days, train fully on rainy days" and "talk during work, practice during rest, learn formations on the way to the fields, aim three shots before and after meals, and combine shooting with tactics," combat capabilities have been greatly improved.

This militia force with a certain level of military skills, along the motherland's long coastline, usually patrols and stands guard together with the local garrison troops, and fights together in wartime. In the past five years, hundreds of thousands of militiamen in Fujian Province with rich combat experience have cooperated with troops in more than 15,000 battles and fought independently in more than 11,900 battles.

    一手拿锄　一手拿枪　劳武结合　保卫国防
    广大民兵成为坚强的国防后备力量
    据新华社31日讯　全国各地有光荣斗争历史的数千万民兵，几年来经过“劳武结合”的军事、政治训练，已经成为一支有组织、有纪律、有觉悟、有一定军事素养和战斗能力的强大的国防后备力量，在保卫海防、边防、巩固内地治安中，成了中国人民解放军的有力助手。
    这支雄厚的群众武装，随着国家的社会主义建设和武装力量的强大，已经由红缨枪、土枪、土炮，进而使用了步枪、冲锋枪、机关枪、小口径火炮和对空火器；由1950年的五百五十万发展成为遍及全国各地的群众性的武装组织，并且在村与村、乡与乡之间，建立了“一地发生情况，周围村镇齐来支援”的严密的联防网。今年，他们在“一手拿锄，一手持枪”的训练当中，出现了“公鸡报晓天未明，大小村庄齐练兵”和“一把锄头一枝枪，田头荒地当操场，锄头开动千斤亩，拿枪练兵保国防”的学习热潮。全国各地通过“大忙少学，小忙多学；晴天少练，雨天全练”和“干活时讲，休息时练，下田路上学队列，饭前饭后瞄三枪，结合射击学战术”等各种“劳武结合”的训练方法，战斗能力有了飞跃提高。
    这支具有一定军事素养的民兵队伍，在祖国漫长的海岸线上，与当地的守备部队平时共同巡逻、放哨，战时一起作战。福建省有丰富战斗经验的数十万民兵，在过去的五年中，配合部队作战一万五千多次，单独作战一万一千九百多次。
