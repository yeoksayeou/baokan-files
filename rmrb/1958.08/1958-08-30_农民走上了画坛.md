Farmers walking onto the painting scene in the great era of the socialist Great Leap Forward, in the great era of ideological liberation, is a great historical event. I have many thoughts after seeing the creations of peasant painters from Pi County, Jiangsu, and Shu County, Hebei.

Lu Xun, in the "Preface" to the "Collection of Twenty Soviet Writers," quoted a passage from Professor Kogang's "Literature of the Great Decade." It pointed out that "proletarian literature after the October Revolution started from life, not from literariness." However, the petty-bourgeois writers at that time regarded the artistic quality of literature as the ultimate goal. When Lu Xun read the works of "fellow travelers who arrived at the real life of revolution from literature" and "proletarian writers who arrived at literature from the real life of revolution," he said with emotion: "When we look at the works, we always feel that the former, although writing about revolution or construction, always reveals the expression of an onlooker, while the latter, as soon as they start writing, are all inside, all their own business."

Although these words are about Soviet literature in the ten years after the October Revolution, they seem to be about our current Chinese art.

A new situation has emerged in China's current art world. On the one hand, there are a small number of experts who have mastered painting techniques, and on the other hand, there are a large number of worker and peasant painters who still lack painting skills. New China came from the old society, and many of the experts who had received bourgeois art education are different from the "fellow travelers" in the Soviet Union at that time in terms of politics. But in terms of artistic path, they are precisely on the road from fine arts to the real life of revolution. Some are doing better, some are doing poorly, and some have not yet started. The worker painters and peasant painters are also very similar to the proletarian writers after the October Revolution. They arrived at fine arts from the real life of revolution. If we compare the works of some experts with the works of the peasant painters in Pi County, can we not feel like Lu Xun that "the former, although writing about revolution or construction, always reveals the expression of an onlooker, while the latter, as soon as they start writing, are all inside, all their own business?" It is not just the "expression of an onlooker," some are completely divorced from reality, painting a bumper harvest as a reduction in production. However, no matter how naive and rough the works of the Pi County peasants are, they are not only "all inside, all their own business as soon as they start writing," but also so kind, warm, simple and moving, full of confidence and hope. Their works bring the era atmosphere of the socialist Great Leap Forward, truly praise their miraculous harvests, and display their today and tomorrow. This once again illustrates the importance of life. Peasant painters are neither "experiencers" nor "in-depth investigators" of life, they are the changemakers of "life," the masters of life. They truly understand life, truly have the enthusiasm for life struggle, and because they have these sources of creative wisdom, they draw out the atmosphere of the socialist Great Leap Forward as soon as they start writing, and they touch the mysteries of life as soon as they start writing. Our experts still need to be familiar with life and transform their thoughts and feelings, so the difference in creation is obvious. If we must say that the works of experts are "big trees" in terms of painting techniques, and the works of peasant painters are "bean sprouts," then from the perspective of the depth of life reflected in the works and the emotion and conception expressed in life, the works of some experts are not bean sprouts, and the works of peasants are not "big trees"!

　　农民走上了画坛
　　力群
    中国农民在社会主义大跃进的大时代，在思想解放的大时代走上画坛，是伟大的历史事件。我看了江苏邳县与河北束鹿农民画家的创作，有不少感想。
    鲁迅在“苏联作家二十人集”的“前记”中，引了珂刚教授在“伟大的十年的文学”中说的一段话。其中指出十月革命后的“无产者文学是从生活出发，不是从文学性出发的”。而当时的小资产阶级的作家，他们却把文学的艺术性当作最终目的。当鲁迅读了“从文学到达了革命底实生活的‘同路人们’”和
  “从革命底实生活到达了文学的无产阶级作家们”的作品时，颇有感慨的说：“我们看起作品来，总觉得前者虽写革命或建设，时时总显出旁观的神情，而后者一落笔，就无一不自己就在里边，都是自己们的事。”
    这些话虽说的是十月革命后十年内的苏联文学，但也好像是在说我们中国目前的美术。
    中国目前的美术界出现了一个新情况，一方面是少量的掌握了绘画技术的专家，一方面是大量的尚缺乏绘画技术的工人农民画家。新中国是从旧社会来的，曾经受过资产阶级美术教育的专家们，从政治上来说，很多人都不同于苏联当时的“同路人”。但从艺术道路上来说，他们却正是在走着从美术到革命底实生活去的路。有的走的较好，有的走的不好，有的还没有走。而工人画家和农民画家也很像十月革命后的无产阶级的作家们，他们是从革命底实生活到达了美术。如果我们把某些专家们的作品和邳县农民画家们的作品比较一下，难道能不像鲁迅似的感到“前者虽写革命或建设，时时总显出旁观的神情，而后者一落笔，就无一不自己就在里边，都是自己们的事。”岂只是“旁观的神情”呢，有的根本脱离实际，把庆丰收画成减产，而邳县农民的作品不管怎样的幼稚粗糙，却不仅“一落笔就无一不自己就在里边，都是自己们的事”，而且是那样的亲切、热烈、朴实动人，充满了自信和希望。他们的作品带来了社会主义大跃进的时代气息，真正的歌颂了他们的奇迹般的丰收，展示了自己的今天和明天。这再一次说明了生活的重要性。农民画家对于生活既不是“体验”者，也不是“深入者”，他们就是“生活”的变革者，生活的主人。他们真正懂得生活，真正有生活斗争的热情，由于具有这些创作的智慧源泉，因而一落笔就画出了社会主义大跃进的气息，一落笔就接触了生活的奥妙，而我们的专家却还有待于熟悉生活，改造思想感情，因此创作上的不同是显然的，如果在绘画技术上一定要说专家的作品是“大树”，农民画家的作品是“豆芽菜”，那么从作品所反映的生活的深度和对生活所表现的感情和构思来说，某些专家的作品又未尝不是豆芽菜，而农民的作品又何尝不是“大树”呢！
