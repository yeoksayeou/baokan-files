Stepping Out of the Study to Reform Teaching
Zu Nian

The anti-rightist movement in higher education institutions, which thoroughly discredited bourgeois individualism and carried out self-revolution, has not only brought about a new atmosphere among teaching staff striving towards the goal of being both red and expert, but has also ushered in a comprehensive reform of teaching content and methods. The characteristics of this comprehensive reform of teaching are: stepping out of the school gates, connecting with practical production, conducting investigation and research to enrich and replenish textbooks with living materials; and on the other hand, inviting comrades engaged in practical work to teach or give reports at the school. In this way, the dogmatism of starting solely from books, mechanically and rigidly applying them, and being divorced from practical production in teaching has begun to be overcome.

Many facts have proven that this kind of teaching reform that connects with practical production not only makes teaching, learning, and application consistent, but also can cultivate socialist construction talents who are both red and expert. However, some people still hold a skeptical attitude towards this extremely simple truth. They are still accustomed to preparing lessons in their studies, divorced from practical production, and still using foreign methods for teaching content and teaching methods. This is thorough dogmatism and a typical case of forgetting one's roots. Holding this attitude not only makes it impossible to carry out a major teaching reform and complete the task of cultivating talents for construction, but also makes it impossible to develop and enrich book knowledge. Countless facts in the past have shown that under this dogmatic education, the talents cultivated are only "armchair strategists" who cannot solve practical problems, or "frail scholars" who cannot withstand wind and rain.

Under the great leap forward situation of socialist construction, new teaching systems and new teaching methods must be adopted in order to cultivate new-type intellectuals for the motherland who are both red and expert, and who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. Beijing Normal University mobilized the masses to go into practice, and teaching realized jumping out of the original framework and breaking through the shackles of old traditions; Renmin University of China and Northwest University opened their school gates, connected with reality, and connected with the masses to reform teaching, and a lively and colorful situation appeared in teaching. These practices are in line with the requirements of teaching reform and can achieve the above-mentioned goals, and are worthy of learning by teachers in higher education institutions across the country.

    走出书斋改革教学
    祖年
    高等院校的双反运动，搞臭资产阶级个人主义，进行自我革命的结果，在教学人员中，不仅出现了一个向红透专深目标前进的新气象，同时在教学内容、教学方法上，也来了一个全面大革新。这种全面革新教学的特点是：走出学校大门，联系生产实际，调查研究，充实和丰富教材中活的材料；另一方面请从事实际工作的同志任教或来校作报告。这样就开始克服了教学中单纯从书本出发，机械死板地生搬硬套，脱离生产实际的教条主义。
    许多事实都证明，这种联系生产实际的改革教学，不仅教、学、用三者一致了，同时还可以培养出又红又专的社会主义建设人材。但是，对于这种极简单的道理，有的人还抱着怀疑的态度。他们仍然习惯于脱离生产实际，在书斋里备课，教学内容和教学方法仍旧搬用国外的一套。这是一种十足的教条主义和典型的忘本思想。抱有这种态度，不仅不能进行教学大改革，完成培养建设人材的任务，而且也不能发展和丰富书本知识。过去的无数事实已经说明，在这种教条主义的教育下，培养出来的人材，只是一些不能解决实际问题的“空谈家”，或经不起风吹雨打的“文弱书生”。
    在社会主义建设的大跃进形势下，必须采取新的教学制度和新的教学方法，才能为祖国培养出又红又专、敢想敢说敢做的新型知识分子。北京师范大学，发动群众，到实际中去，教学上就实现了跳出原有框框，冲破旧传统的束缚；中国人民大学、西北大学，敞开学校大门，联系实际，联系群众改革教学，教学上就出现了有声有色的局面。这些作法，都是符合于教学改革的要求，能够达到上述的目的的作法，值得全国高等院校中的教师们学习。
