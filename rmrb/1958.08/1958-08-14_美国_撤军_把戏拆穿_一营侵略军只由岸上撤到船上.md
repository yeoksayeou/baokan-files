Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Reports from Western news agencies and newspapers have exposed the American charade of pretending to "withdraw" a battalion of Marines from Lebanon. According to reports, the battalion of US Marines that was scheduled to be "rotated" back home, and which began "withdrawing" from Lebanon today, is not actually preparing to return home. Instead, it will remain on ships off the coast of Lebanon as a "mobile reserve," waiting for an opportunity to act.

According to an Agence France-Presse report from Beirut on August 12th, the US announced that "this battalion of Marines that is withdrawing today will remain on warships patrolling near the port of Lebanon as a reserve force, and its withdrawal will not significantly change the deployment of US forces."

The American "Daily Mail" also said on August 12th, "This battalion will return to their warships, ready to act as a striking force at any time." This situation once again confirms that the "withdrawal" trick played by the United States during the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting was merely to deceive world public opinion and to try to escape public trial by shedding its aggressor's hat at the UN General Assembly.

　　美国“撤军”把戏拆穿
　　一营侵略军只由岸上撤到船上
    新华社13日讯　西方通讯社和报刊透露的情况拆穿了美国假装从黎巴嫩“撤出”一营海军陆战队的西洋镜。据透露，今天已经开始分三天从黎巴嫩“撤出”的一营早该“轮换”回国的美国海军陆战队也并不准备回国，而是将留在黎巴嫩海面舰只上作为“流动预备队”，伺机而动。
    据法新社12日从贝鲁特报道，美国宣布在今天“撤退的这营海军陆战队将留在黎巴嫩港口附近巡逻的军舰上作为后备，它的撤退并不会显然改变美军的部署”。
    美国“每日邮报”也在12日说，“这一营人将回到他们的军舰上去，作为打击力量随时准备行动”。这种情况再次证实，美国在联合国大会举行紧急会议时玩弄的“撤军”骗局，只不过是为了欺骗世界舆论和企图在联大会议上摘掉侵略者的帽子逃避公审罢了。
