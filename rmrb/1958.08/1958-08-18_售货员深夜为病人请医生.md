　　Salesman Calls Doctor for Sick Person Late at Night

　　One night in July, Zhang Yihe, a 50-year-old shop assistant at the Songshangying Second Branch of the Songmen Public-Private Joint Venture General Store in our county, carried various groceries and small agricultural machinery parts to Nanzhuangtou Village to sell door-to-door. Around 11 o'clock at night, as he walked along the back street of the village, he suddenly heard a woman shouting from a house next to the road: "It hurts so much! Help..." He rushed into the house and saw that it was a woman who had suddenly fallen ill and was suffering from severe stomach pain. Coincidentally, her husband was not at home, and her three children were sitting beside her crying.

　　Seeing her critical condition, Zhang Yihe forgot the fatigue of working all day and, regardless of the darkness and distance, ran in one breath to the Liumingfu Clinic, more than five miles away, and brought Doctor Shen Hongjun to treat the patient. Thanks to timely treatment, the woman was not in danger and quickly recovered.

　　The woman and her husband, Zhang Jinfeng, were very grateful to Zhang Yihe and often praised him in front of others: "Zhang Yihe is truly a good salesman under the leadership of Chairman Mao!"

　　售货员深夜为病人请医生
    7月间有个夜晚，我们县宋门公私合营综合商店宋上营第二分店的五十岁的老店员张义和，背着各种杂货和小型农具零件，到南庄头村去登门串户售货。在深夜十一点钟左右，当他走到村后街的时候，忽然听到道旁边一间屋子里有妇女叫喊：“痛死了！救命呀……”他急忙走进房内一看，原来是个妇女得了急病，肚子痛得很厉害。偏巧她丈夫不在家，三个孩子吓得坐在她身旁直哭。
    张义和看到她病势危急，忘记了工作一天的劳累，不顾天黑路远，一口气便跑到五里多远的留名府诊所，把医生沈洪俊请来给病人治病。由于治疗及时，这个妇女没有发生危险，很快病就好了。
    这个妇女和她的丈夫张金峰都非常感激张义和，常常在别人面前称赞他：“张义和真是毛主席领导下的好售货员！”
