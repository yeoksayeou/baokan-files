Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 17th: The "Arima Maru" freighter, carrying a set of "Oerlikon 56" missile launchers and ten missiles purchased by the Japanese Defense Agency from Switzerland, arrived at Yokohama Port this morning. Members of the Yokohama Port Workers' Union Federation used their actions to issue a serious warning against the nuclear armament policy of the Nobusuke Kishi government, refusing to unload the missiles onto the shore.

More than 300 members of the "Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent the Import of Oerlikon 56 Missiles," composed of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, trade unions, and student groups, gathered at the American Pier, the scheduled missile unloading site, this morning to express their opposition to the import of missiles, and conducted a water demonstration around the "Arima Maru" on five boats. The secretary-general of the Yokohama Port Workers' Union Federation, Izaki, firmly stated that dockworkers would absolutely not unload cargo related to nuclear weapons. The Joint Struggle Conference decided to mobilize 1,000 people tomorrow to continue preventing the unloading of the "Oerlikon 56" missiles.

The unloading of 3,400 tons of general goods carried by the "Arima Maru" has been completed, with only the "Oerlikon 56" missiles still lying in the hold.

　　日本码头工人拒绝起卸导弹
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：载运日本防卫厅从瑞士买来的“厄利康56”型导弹发射装置一套和导弹十枚的“有马丸”货轮今天早晨到达横滨港，横滨港湾工会联合会的会员用实际行动严重地警告了岸信介政府的核武装政策，他们拒绝向岸上卸运这批导弹。
    由日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、日本共产党、社会党、工会和学生团体组成的“阻止运进厄利康56型导弹联合斗争会议”的成员三百多人，今天早晨到预定起卸导弹的美利坚码头集会，表示反对运进导弹，并且分乘五艘船在“有马丸”周围举行了水上示威。横滨港湾工会联合会书记长伊崎坚决地表示，码头工人绝对不卸运和核武器有关的货物。联合斗争会议决定明天要动员一千人继续阻止“厄利康56”型导弹的起卸。
    “有马丸”载运的一般物资三千四百吨的起卸工作已经完毕，只有“厄利康56”型导弹还躺在船舱里。
