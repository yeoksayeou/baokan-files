Criticism and Response

    Xin Guang Brand Flashlight Now Conducts Electricity
    After seeing Comrade Lü Chen's letter in the "Readers' Letters" column of your newspaper on July 3rd criticizing our factory's Xin Guang brand flashlights for not conducting electricity, we offer the following response:
    In March of this year, our factory, based on the feedback of many consumers, specifically researched and sought to improve the problem of Xin Guang brand flashlights not conducting electricity. By April, we had successfully improved the design and overcome the defect of flashlights not conducting electricity.
    The flashlight that Comrade Lü Chen bought was a product from before March. We are responsible for repairing or replacing it, and the round-trip postage will be borne by our factory. We hope that Comrade Lü Chen will send the flashlight back to our factory for processing.

    新光牌电筒通电了
    我们看到吕辰同志在7月3日你报读者来信栏批评我厂出品的新光牌电筒不通电的来信后，作如下答复：
    今年3月份，我厂根据很多消费者的反映，专门研究设法改进新光牌电筒不通电的问题，到4月份已改进成功，克服了电筒不通电的缺点。
    吕辰同志买的电筒是3月份以前的产品，我们负责修理或换货，来回的邮费由我厂负担。希望吕辰同志把电筒寄回我厂处理。
