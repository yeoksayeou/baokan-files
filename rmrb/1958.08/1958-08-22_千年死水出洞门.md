Thousand-Year Dead Water Exits the Cave

　　Inside a dark cave more than forty zhang deep, a deafening sound of stone explosions suddenly erupted. At that moment, people were both surprised and delighted: delighted that something no one dared to do for thousands of years was being done today; surprised whether He Zhiyun, the demobilized soldier who set off the stone explosion, would encounter misfortune.

　　He Zhiyun is from Gaobao Township, Er District, Longli County, Guizhou Province. During the Great Leap Forward in Production, he participated in the district-organized youth shock brigade, responsible for constructing the Ximachang water conservancy project. Before construction began, someone needed to enter a very deep dark cave to explore the water source situation. He Zhiyun and another demobilized soldier, Yang Xiuhua, volunteered and completed this task. After investigation, it was determined that there was a seven- or eight-zhang-deep dark pool more than forty zhang inside the cave, and above the dark pool was a large overhanging cliff. To draw water out of the cave, it was necessary to blast the overhanging cliff and fill in the dark pool. This task was very difficult because the air inside the cave was poor. If people stayed inside for a long time, they would have difficulty breathing and their faces would turn pale. Generally, people in poor health couldn't endure it. Furthermore, when drilling holes in the overhanging cliff, it was not easy to stand firmly, and carelessness could lead to falling into the dark pool, posing a life-threatening danger. However, Comrade He Zhiyun was the first to express his willingness to undertake this task. He formed a shock team with two other demobilized soldiers, Sun Shiming and Yang Xiuhua, and worked hard for three days, drilling twelve holes in the overhanging cliff, loading them with more than ten kilograms of yellow explosives, and preparing to blast. Blasting on such an overhanging cliff was even more dangerous. But He Zhiyun again took on this task alone. He twisted the twelve fuses together and tied them to a rope hanging down from the cliff. After lighting the fuses on the cliff, he slid down the rope like a shooting star. As soon as he got away, a deafening explosion sounded, and the entire overhanging cliff fell down. Instantly, the cave filled with smoke and stinging fumes, and Comrade He Zhiyun temporarily lost consciousness. But when he regained consciousness, he was as happy as if he had blown up the enemy's bunker. Although he was injured, he was very pleased.

　　After blasting the overhanging cliff and filling in the dark pool, the water conservancy project was fully launched. Soon, the water that had been flowing away uselessly for thousands of years was drawn out of the cave. From then on, the masses in Ximachang no longer had to carry water from more than two li away, and many rice fields were spared the threat of drought. Sun Jiazhi composed a doggerel to praise him: "He Zhiyun toiled in the dark cave, Thousand-year dark water exits the gate, Eight thousand dan of rice paddies no longer drought-stricken, Can guarantee a yield of two thousand catties per mu."

　　千年死水出洞门
    在四十多丈深的黑洞里，突然发出了震天动地的石炮声。这时，人们又惊又喜：喜的是千百年来没有人敢做的事，今天有人做了；惊的是，不知放石炮的复员军人何芝云是否会遭遇不幸。
    何芝云是贵州省龙里县二区高堡乡人。在生产大跃进中，他参加了区里组织的青年突击队，负责兴修西马场水利。动工之先，需要人先进入一个很深的黑洞里去探清水源情况，何芝云和另外的一个复员军人杨秀华等，自告奋勇地承担并且完成了这一任务。经查明：进洞四十多丈的地方有个七、八丈深的阴潭，阴潭上面有个大悬岩，要引水出洞就要炸掉悬岩、填平阴潭。这个任务是非常困难的。因为洞内空气不好，人在里面时间久了，就会呼吸困难、脸色苍白，一般身体不太好的人都支持不了。再说，在悬岩上打炮眼，脚不容易站稳，一不小心就会掉到阴潭里去，有生命的危险。但何芝云同志首先表示愿意承担这个任务。他和另外两个复员军人孙士明和杨秀华组成了突击组，苦战了三天，在悬岩上打了十二个炮眼，装上了十几斤黄色炸药，准备放炮。在这样的悬岩上放炮，那就更加危险了。但何芝云又单独担任了这一工作。他把十二根导火线拧在一起，另用一条绳子绑在岩头上垂到岩下。他在岩上点燃导火线以后，就像流星一样顺着绳子吊下来。刚一躲开，震天动地的一声响了，整个悬岩掉了下来。霎时，洞里烟雾弥漫，辣气熏人，何芝云同志暂时失去了知觉。但当他清醒过来以后，就像爆破了敌人的碉堡一样，身上虽然受了伤，心里却挺高兴。
    炸掉悬岩、填平阴潭以后，水利工程便全面铺开。很快，这股千百年来白白流掉的水被引出洞来了。从此，西马场的群众再也用不着到两里路以外去挑水吃了，很多的稻田也免除了旱灾的威胁。孙家芝编了一个顺口溜赞扬他：“苦战阴洞何芝云，千年阴水出洞门，八千挑稻田不受旱，能保亩产双千斤。”
