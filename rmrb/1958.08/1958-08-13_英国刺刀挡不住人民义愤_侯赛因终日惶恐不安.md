Xinhua News Agency, August 12th dispatch from Bonn: The West German bourgeois newspaper "Kölner Rundschau" published a report on August 11th from its correspondent in Amman, the capital of Jordan, stating that "an atmosphere of imminent revolution is permeating throughout Jordan."

According to the reporter, King Hussein, facing this situation, is "mentally on the verge of collapse." The reporter wrote that currently, Hussein "remains secluded in the palace every day, refusing to meet anyone except cabinet ministers and royal family members." He now even "lacks trust in his own guards."

According to the reporter, Jordanian authorities have confiscated all radios in the country, attempting to block the flow of information to residents and stem the tide of revolution by this means. (Attached picture)

　　侯赛因终日惶恐不安
    新华社12日讯　波恩消息：西德资产阶级报纸“科隆评论”报11日刊载了该报记者从约旦首都安曼发回的一篇报道说，“一种革命即将爆发的气氛正弥漫约旦全境”。
    据这个记者报道，国王侯赛因面对着这种形势，“精神状态已经濒于崩溃边缘”。记者写道，目前侯赛因“除了同内阁大臣和王室人员见面外，每天闭居深宫，拒绝会见任何人”。他现在甚至“对自己的卫士都缺乏信任”。
    据这个记者报道，约旦当局已经没收了全国所有的收音机，妄图用这种办法来封锁居民的消息来源，以阻挡革命潮流。（附图片）
