Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: The "Worker's Weekly" of the United States published an article by Shields on July 27, discussing the significant improvement in the health of William Foster, Honorary Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States.

	The report, titled "Spending a Sunny Day with William Foster," stated, "William Foster is now enjoying the pleasures of outdoor life again. Any visitor can see the progress in his health. It has been almost ten months since he was paralyzed in October last year."

	"The drive did not make him feel very tired. He even wrote some things (dictated) after returning. Obviously, his physical therapy is very effective. He refuses to use a cane or a wheelchair. He uses physical therapy to restore flexibility to the once-paralyzed muscles."

	Shields said that Foster is wholeheartedly concerned about the current struggles and the future of socialism, and concerned about the dear party to which he has devoted thirty-seven or eight years of his life. He is proud of his party, and he is very happy that his party has now passed through the most vicious storm of revisionism and put on the armor of battle again.

    福斯特健康状况好转
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：7月27日美国“工人周报”刊载薛尔兹的一篇报道，谈到美国共产党名誉主席威廉·福斯特的健康状况最近已经有很大好转。
    这篇题为“同威廉·福斯特度过阳光灿烂的一天”的报道说，“威廉·福斯特现在又享受户外生活的乐趣了。任何访问者都可以看出他的健康的进步。自从他在去年10月间瘫痪以来，至今已经快有十个月了。
    “这次驱车出游并没有使他感到很疲乏。他回来后还写了一些东西（口授）。显然，他的体育疗法很有效。他拒绝使用拐杖或者转轮椅。他用体育疗法使得一度瘫痪的肌肉恢复了灵活性。”
    薛尔兹说，福斯特全心关注着目前的斗争和社会主义的前途，关注着他已为之贡献生命三十七八年的亲爱的党。他对他的党感到自豪，他的党现在已经度过了最凶恶的修正主义风暴，又披上了战斗的盔甲，这使他感到很高兴。
