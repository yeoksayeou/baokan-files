Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 26th: The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper today urged the United States and other Western countries not to engage in double-dealing tactics towards Indonesia.

The newspaper pointed out in an editorial that while the United States and Britain sell some unimportant weapons to Indonesia, foreign aircraft constantly harass Indonesia. Therefore, the Indonesian people will come to the conclusion that Western countries are smiling to their faces while kicking them in the back, extending their right hand while slapping them in the face with their left hand.

In another report, the newspaper revealed that unidentified aircraft have recently appeared in West Java. These aircraft often fly at night, making it difficult to identify their country of origin. According to the newspaper, the bases of these unidentified aircraft are probably on the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island.

The newspaper quoted Air Force spokesman Captain Suroto as saying that there is still a possibility of being attacked by unidentified aircraft, so vigilance must be maintained at all times.

The "Indonesian Torch" hopes that Western countries, especially the United States, will stop playing double-dealing policies and stop the harassment activities that foreigners are still continuing.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 26th: According to Antara News Agency, Manai Sophian, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Subcommittee of the Indonesian Parliament, suggested on the 25th that the government investigate the base from which the rebel group's "B-26" bombers, which recently flew over parts of North Sulawesi, took off.

Sophian said that he believes the rebel group's bomber base must be abroad, because there is no airport in Indonesia that can accommodate giant bombers to land.

The Congressman said that the Indonesian government should investigate this "conspiracy," investigate the aircraft's base and nationality, and then take measures in accordance with the statement recently submitted by the government to the Parliament.

Sophian made these remarks to reporters regarding reports that an unidentified B-26 bomber was seen flying over North Sulawesi on August 12.

Prior to this, Prime Minister Juanda stated in a policy statement to the Parliament that the government will take resolute and wise actions to deal with foreign airfields used by aircraft attacking certain parts of Indonesia.

　　当面装笑脸　背后暗算人
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”揭露美国的两面手法
    议员索菲安要求调查叛军飞机的起飞基地
    新华社雅加达26日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天要求美国和其它西方国家不要对印度尼西亚耍两面手法。
    这家报纸在社论中指出，在美国和英国把一些不重要的武器卖给印度尼西亚的同时，外国飞机却不断骚扰印度尼西亚。因此，印度尼西亚人民就会得出这样的结论：西方国家一面装着笑脸，一面却从背后踢人，一边向人伸出右手，一边却用左手打人的耳光。
    这家报纸在另一篇报道中揭露，最近西爪哇仍然出现国籍不明的飞机。这些飞机经常在夜间飞行，因此很难辨认它们是属于那个国家的。据这家报纸说，这些国籍不明的飞机的基地大概在科斯科斯岛和圣诞岛上。
    报纸援引了空军发言人苏罗多上尉的话说，将来仍然有可能遭到国籍不明的飞机的空袭，因此必须随时提高警惕。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”希望西方国家，特别是美国，停止玩弄两面派政策，并且制止外国人现在仍在继续进行的骚扰活动。
    新华社雅加达26日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚国会国防小组委员会副主席马纳伊·索菲安25日建议政府调查最近飞过北苏拉威西某些地方的叛乱集团的“B—26”型轰炸机起飞的基地。
    索菲安说，他相信叛乱集团的轰炸机的基地一定是在国外，因为印度尼西亚没有一个飞机场可供巨型轰炸机着陆。
    这位议员说，印度尼西亚政府应该调查这种“阴谋活动”，调查飞机的基地和国籍，并且在以后按照政府最近在国会提出的声明采取措施。
    索菲安就所传在8月12日看到国籍不明的B—26型轰炸机飞过北苏拉威西的消息向记者们发表了这番谈话。
    在这以前，朱安达总理在国会上提出的政策声明中说，政府将采取坚决和明智的行动来对付袭击印度尼西亚某些地方的飞机使用的国外机场。
