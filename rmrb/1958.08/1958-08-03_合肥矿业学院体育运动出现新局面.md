Hefei Mining College has recently seen a new leap forward in sports activities.

The number of people participating in exercise at the college has rapidly increased to nearly 100%, from a previous level of only 50% who consistently exercised. Many exercise groups persevere with diligent training, regardless of weather conditions. Over 90% of the faculty and staff have also organized themselves to participate in exercise, with middle-aged and elderly teachers, as well as Party and administrative leaders, taking part in activities such as calisthenics, volleyball, table tennis, and Tai Chi. Every morning and afternoon, during exercise time, the indoor and outdoor exercise areas are lively and bustling, filled with a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere.

As a result of three months of mass-based, diligent training, the achievements far surpass those of the past two or three years. In May, there were no labor-defense system classes in the entire college, but now there are twenty-three, accounting for 27.4% of the college's eighty-four classes. In April, only 45% of the students passed the labor-defense system Level 1, but now 94% of the total student body has passed. In April, only 4.4% passed Level 2, but now it has reached 37%. In April, there were only one hundred and twenty-four graded athletes, but now there are three hundred and sixty-seven.

During this period, the school's various representative teams have achieved excellent results in numerous provincial and municipal competitions. The men's and women's track and field teams won the men's and women's championships at the Anhui Province College Track and Field Meet held in April. The men's and women's volleyball teams won the men's and women's championships at the Hefei City Volleyball Championships held in May. The basketball team won the championship in the Hefei City 1958 Basketball Graded Competition. The cycling, weightlifting, martial arts, and men's and women's swimming teams all won championships in the Hefei City cycling, weightlifting, martial arts, swimming, and other championships held in June.

    合肥矿业学院体育运动出现新局面
    本报讯　合肥矿业学院最近出现了体育锻炼大跃进的新局面。
    这个学院由原来只有50％的人坚持锻炼的基础上，现在参加锻炼的人数很快提高到接近100％。许多锻炼小组风雨无阻，坚持苦炼。教职员中90％以上的人也都组织起来参加锻炼，中老年教师和党、行政领导人也分别参加广播操、排球、乒乓球和太极拳等项活动。每天早晨和下午，锻炼时间内，室内外锻炼场上，生气勃勃，处处呈现着紧张、热烈的气氛。
    由于三个月来群众性的苦干苦炼，大大超过了过去两三年的锻炼成绩。5月份全院还没有一个劳卫制班级，现在已出现了二十三个劳卫制班，占全院八十四班的27.4％，4月份学生劳卫制一级及格的只有45％，现在劳卫制一级及格的已达到学生总数的94％；4月份劳卫制二级及格的只有4.4％，现在已达到37％。4月份等级运动员只有一百二十四人，现在已达到三百六十七人。
    在这时期内，学校各种代表队在参加省、市的多次竞赛中都取得了优异成绩，男女田径代表队参加安徽省4月举行的大专学校田径运动会，取得了男女冠军，男女排球队参加合肥市5月举行的排球锦标赛，取得了男女冠军，篮球队参加合肥市1958年篮球等级赛中获得了冠军，自行车、举重、武术、男女游泳代表队，参加合肥市6月举行的自行车、举重、武术、游泳等各项锦标赛中都获得了冠军。
