　　A Miracle, and Also Valuable Experience
　　Lei Bo
　　In many regions of our country, especially those with complex dialects, the widespread promotion of Mandarin Chinese is not only closely related to socialist construction, but also an urgent demand of the broad masses. In the past, many people believed that this was a relatively long-term and arduous task, impossible to achieve in the short term. Today, the news report published in this newspaper about Datian County, Fujian Province, popularizing Mandarin Chinese in four months raises new questions for us regarding the universalization of Mandarin.
　　Why was Datian County able to popularize Mandarin Chinese throughout the county in just four months? The main reason is that it grasped two important keys: the Party Committee taking the lead and following the mass line. The County Party Committee deeply understood the urgent desire of the broad masses to learn Mandarin Chinese and fully recognized the possibility of local foundations and objective conditions. Therefore, when the Party Committee issued a call, the cadres took the lead together, and the masses responded in unison, a high tide of promoting Mandarin Chinese was launched throughout the county in a very short time, achieving very gratifying results and raising the first red flag of popularizing Mandarin Chinese high in Fujian Province. Datian's achievements have given a profound lesson to those who harbor conservative ideas and outdated concepts, and who do not believe in the masses, the "conditionalists" and "pessimists."
　　In all our work, there is a struggle between advanced and conservative ideas. In the past, Fujian Province had also advocated the promotion of Mandarin Chinese, but some comrades who were responsible for the work of promoting Mandarin Chinese were accustomed to sitting in offices and making plans, liked to sit in studies and move dogmas, did not go deep into the masses, and did not contact reality, their thinking lagging behind reality. They only saw that the Fujian dialect was complex and had held a dominant position in some areas for thousands of years, and that it had a firm habitual aspect among the masses, but they did not see the other, positive side, which is that the dialect had already caused many inconveniences to the masses' production and life, and had caused the separation of feelings and thoughts between regions and between people, and therefore, they urgently demanded to change this backward situation and had a strong desire to learn Mandarin Chinese. They always emphasized difficulties, and when they worked, they followed the rules step by step, taking small steps and staggering along. They faced schools and intellectual circles, not the broad masses of workers and peasants. As a result, schools became their small world for experimenting with the promotion of Mandarin Chinese, and "gradual popularization" became their rigid rules. Of course, Datian County also faced difficulties in promoting Mandarin Chinese, but they were all overcome by relying on the masses. After recalling and comparing education, the masses remembered the suffering they had endured due to language barriers and realized the benefits of learning Mandarin Chinese, which would transform negative factors into positive factors, and learning Mandarin Chinese would become the masses' conscious demand and action.
　　Datian County also solved a fundamental problem in promoting Mandarin Chinese, which is who to rely on to promote Mandarin Chinese. In the past, some areas of Fujian only believed in experts when promoting Mandarin Chinese, did not rely on the Party Committee, let alone the masses. Some experts were keen on opening dialect investigation classes, conducting dialect investigations, printing dialect investigation cards, and buying tape recorders, regarding "correspondence rules" as golden rules. However, the pamphlets they wrote were incomprehensible to the masses, and the money and time spent did not help the broad masses to learn Mandarin Chinese much. Datian County's approach was the opposite. They did not have an expert, did not have a reliable dialect investigation record, and did not spend a penny. They only relied on the leadership of the Party Committee, with literacy teachers and rural people who could speak a few words of Mandarin Chinese as the backbone, mobilizing the masses to teach and learn from each other. They combined the promotion of Mandarin Chinese with production and literacy. They did not limit learning Mandarin Chinese to schools, but made mountains, fields, shops, and villages everywhere places to learn Mandarin Chinese. While focusing on key areas, they also paid attention to vigorous popularization, and improved on the basis of popularization. This is a mass-line promotion method that is more, faster, better, and more economical, and it is worth learning from all over the country.
　　In short, Datian County's experience is successful. Now that there is a precedent, it will not be difficult to see the emergence of a second, a third, or even more counties and provinces that popularize Mandarin Chinese. Let us see more of such moving good news as soon as possible!

　　是奇迹，也是宝贵经验

    在我国许多地区，特别是方言复杂的地区，广泛地推广普通话，不仅同社会主义建设有密切关系，而且是广大群众的迫切要求。过去，很多人认为这是一个比较长期、比较艰巨的工作，不可能在短期内实现。今天，本报发表的福建省大田县四个月推广普通话的新闻，为我们普及普通话提出了新的课题。
    大田县为什么能以四个月时间在全县普及普通话呢？主要是抓住了党委挂帅、走群众路线两个重要关键。县委深刻地体会到广大群众对学习普通话的迫切要求，充分认识到当地基础和客观条件的可能性。所以当党委号召一下，干部一齐带头，群众齐声响应，在很短时间内，就在全县范围掀起了推广普通话的高潮，获得十分可喜的成绩，在福建省高高竖起普及普通话的第一面红旗。大田的成绩给存有保守思想和陈旧观念、不相信群众的“条件论”者和“悲观论”者上了深刻的一课。
    在我们的一切工作中，都有先进和保守思想的斗争。过去，在福建省也曾提倡过推广普通话，但是一些担任推广普通话工作的同志，习惯于坐办公室订计划，喜欢坐书房搬教条，不深入群众，不接触实际，思想落后于实际。他们只看到福建方言复杂，在部分地区占有几千年的统治地位，在群众中有牢固的习惯性的一面，而看不到另外的、积极的一面，就是方言已经给群众生产、生活造成了许多不便，造成了地区与地区、人与人的感情和思想上的隔绝，因而迫切要求改变这种落后局面，有学习普通话的强烈愿望。他们总是强调困难，工作起来，按部就班，小手小脚，一步三摇。他们面对的是学校、知识界，而不是广大工农群众，结果，学校变成他们试验推广普通话的小天地，“逐步普及”变成他们的清规戒律。当然，大田县在推广普通话中，也不是没有困难的，但都依靠群众而加以克服了。经过回忆对比教育，群众想起语言隔绝所吃的苦头，认识了学会普通话的好处，就会把消极因素转化为积极因素，学习普通话就成为群众自觉的要求和行动。
    大田县在推广普通话中，还解决了一个基本问题，就是究竟依靠谁来推广普通话。过去，福建有的地区推广普通话时，只迷信专家，不依靠党委，更不依靠群众。有些专家热中于大开方言调查班，大搞方言调查，大印方言调查卡片，大买录音机，视“对应规律”如金科玉律。可是，写出来的小册子群众看不懂，花费了金钱和时间，却对广大群众学习普通话无多大帮助。大田县的作法与此相反，他们没有一个专家，没有一本可靠的方言调查记录，也没有花一文钱，只是依靠党委领导，以扫盲教师和农村中会讲几句普通话的人为骨干，发动群众互教互学，他们把推广普通话与生产结合，与扫盲结合，不是把学习普通话局限于学校，而把山上、田间、店里、村头到处都成为学习普通话的场所。他们在重点推行的同时，也注意大力普及，又在普及的基础上提高。这是一种多快好省的群众路线的推广方法，值得各地学习。
    总之，大田县的经验是成功的，既然有了先例，就不难出现其二、其三，甚至更多的普及普通话的县和省。让我们早日看到更多的这样动人的喜讯吧！
