    "Around Chairman Mao"
    On the morning of March 18, 1947, people in Yan'an heard the sound of artillery fire coming from the hillside to the left of Wangjiaping. It was the Kuomintang's final offensive against Yan'an. Our army made a strategic retreat, and after dusk, the last group of villagers and cadres from Yan'an also left, but Chairman Mao hadn't moved yet!
    At night, a cave dwelling was still lit, and the surroundings seemed so quiet. Chairman Mao was working there calmly as usual. He smiled at those who came to persuade him to leave early and said, "It's okay, there's still time. The road is open to the sky, each person takes half! They go their way, I go my way. They're on that hill, I'm on this hill, what's there to be afraid of!"
    It wasn't until late at night that Chairman Mao slowly walked out of the cave dwelling. In the night, he gazed deeply at this silent, empty city, and after asking whether the villagers and cadres had all left, he was the last one to leave Yan'an.
    Yan'an, this is the cradle of the Chinese people's revolution. At that time, who could leave it without shouting from the bottom of their hearts: Yan'an, we will definitely return! Thanks to Comrade Jiang Qin Feng, the author of "Around Chairman Mao," he has written down these moving scenes in the history of the Chinese revolution for us, because he has been working as a guard following Chairman Mao, writing down this precious feeling of the people and the leader's love for the people!
    The sections "Chairman Mao Congratulates the Villagers on Their Birthday" and "Chairman Mao Did Not Cross the Yellow River" in the book are all very touching.

    “在毛主席周围”
    1947年3月18日上午，延安的人们听到从王家坪左边的山坡上传来了大炮声。那是国民党对延安的最后进攻。我们的军队作了战略的撤退，薄暮后，延安的最后一批老乡和机关干部也离开了，但是，毛主席还没动咧！
    夜里，有个窑洞还点着灯火，周围显得那么安静，毛主席在那里镇静如常地工作，他对来劝他早点出发的人笑着说：“不要紧，来得及，大路朝天，一人半边！他走他的，我走我的，他在那个山头，我在这个山头，怕什么！”
    直到深夜，毛主席才慢慢从窑洞走出来，在夜色中，他深情地凝视着这座寂静的空城，又问了老乡和干部们是否都走完了以后，才最后一个离开了延安。
    延安，这是中国人民革命的摇篮，当时有谁离开它不从心里喊着：延安，我们一定会回来的！感谢“在毛主席的周围”的作者蒋秦峰同志，他因一直跟随毛主席作警卫工作，为我们写下了中国革命史上这些动人的场景，写下了人民的这种珍贵的感情和领袖对于人民的爱！
    书中“毛主席给老乡们贺寿”、“毛主席没过黄河”等节，看了都令人十分感动。
