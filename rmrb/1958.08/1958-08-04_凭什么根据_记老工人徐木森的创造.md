    What's the Basis?
    --A Record of Old Worker Xu Musen's Creation
  　By our reporter Tian Lianggeng
    A hundred-meter-high chimney is as tall as a thirty-story building. Only the construction engineering departments in Shenyang, Jilin, and other places have built a few like it in the whole country. The Yunnan Tin Industry Company's Construction Engineering Company was undertaking such a large chimney for the first time. Therefore, the company decided that the chimney would be designed by the company itself.
    Using wooden structure to replace steel structure for internal scaffolding
    In early April, the company convened a professional meeting. Deputy Chief Engineer Deng Shouwei described his construction plan for the large chimney, which he had been brewing and designing for several months. This plan used twelve seamless steel pipes as supports to build an internal steel scaffolding for construction. At this time, Xu Musen, a seventh-grade veteran carpenter attending the meeting, suddenly had an idea: steel is too expensive and in short supply on the market, why not use a wooden structure instead of a steel structure? He recalled that he had been responsible for building a forty-meter-high and a sixty-meter-high chimney successively. These two chimneys used wooden structures for scaffolding, which were also quite safe, and only had four wooden supports. Xu Musen immediately proposed the suggestion of replacing steel with wood. Engineer Deng believed that no technical specification book had ever seen the logic of using wooden structures.
    However, Xu Musen's technical innovation proposal was supported and encouraged by Director Sun at the construction site. Xu Musen drew a design draft of the wooden structure for the internal scaffolding and then went to Engineer Deng to discuss and ask for instructions.
    Do you have any theoretical basis?
    Engineer Deng believed that his design had been thought through and researched theoretically, and that steel structures were the safest. When he saw Xu Musen's design draft, he asked unhappily, "What's the basis? Do you have any theoretical basis?" He wanted a theoretical basis! This stumped Xu Musen, an old worker who had only studied for four years as a child and had been an apprentice since he was twelve years old. He thought: My family has been carpenters for generations, and I don't know many big characters, where would I get any theory! It was like a bucket of cold water poured on his head, chilling him halfway.
    Xu Musen mentioned his past experience in constructing chimneys. Engineer Deng said to him, "Old Xu! You haven't made a hundred-meter-high chimney before, and the wood in Yunnan is not good, it has high moisture content, poor compressive resistance, and is prone to problems." Engineer Deng advised him not to be blindly reckless and said, "You have no culture and can't calculate. If there is an accident, you won't be able to explain it. My steel structure design has a theoretical basis, and if something goes wrong, I can give a reason if there is a lawsuit." In the end, Engineer Deng gave his design drawings to Xu Musen, instructing him to study them carefully and follow them in the future.
    Xu Musen came back after being rebuffed, feeling unhappy. He thought:
    The basis is having built large chimneys
    What's the basis? The basis is having built large chimneys, is having forty years of carpentry experience.
    I haven't made a hundred-meter-high chimney, but I have made forty and sixty-meter-high ones. You, Engineer Deng, haven't made one at all.
    As the saying goes, "A standing piece of wood can hold a thousand catties." In the past, the internal scaffolding of a sixty-meter-high chimney used four wooden supports and could withstand the pressure. Now, the internal scaffolding of a hundred-meter-high chimney uses twelve wooden supports, won't it be able to withstand it?
    Xu Musen had been working with wood every day for forty years, and he was familiar with the temperament of various kinds of wood. After considering it again and again, he felt confident that the wooden structure could withstand the pressure. He enlarged his design draft and made a wooden model. He asked the construction site leaders, technicians, and veteran workers to study it together. After everyone looked at the model and discussed it, they all agreed. However, whether the construction method would use steel or wooden scaffolding could not be definitively determined.
    By this time, it was already late April. The construction method was delayed again and again. Seeing that the rainy season was approaching, Xu Musen, who was responsible for the chimney construction, thought: If we don't seize the good dry season to start construction, and delay it until the rainy season, the progress of the project will inevitably be affected. One night, at the construction site, Xu Musen excitedly poured out his distress to Deputy Director Guan of the construction site. Deputy Director Guan comforted him and, on behalf of the construction site, made a guarantee and asked the company's construction manager for instructions to use wooden structures as scaffolding, hoping to get leadership support. This manager, on the one hand, did not study the business thoroughly enough, and on the other hand, did not go deep into the site and study with the personnel, and thirdly, the construction site did not submit materials, and he also had a mysterious concept about chimney construction. Therefore, when Deputy Director Guan raised the issue, he said, based on Engineer Deng's opinion: This is no small matter, a hundred meters high, how can wooden structures work? He also asked: Do you have calculation data? If there is a problem without data, would you dare to take responsibility? Deputy Director Guan was turned back.
    Somewhat shaken
    At this time, the administrative leaders of the construction site felt that there was no way if the company did not agree, and they were somewhat shaken by Xu Musen's suggestion. The company issued the construction method to the construction site, asking the construction site to order goods according to the drawings of the steel structure scaffolding. Xu Musen felt very uncomfortable after learning that the company had not adopted his suggestion. With a heavy heart, he calculated the amount of steel needed to prepare for ordering goods according to the drawings. At the same time, he thought about the benefits of using wood to save steel and speed up the progress of the project. He wondered why the leaders did not agree with his suggestion.
    Some people whose minds were not liberated also began to waver. Some technicians said: Why bother to insist? Whether it's steel or wood, just do whatever the leaders decide to use. Among the workers, those who were close to Xu Musen privately advised him: Old Xu, don't insist anymore. The steel structure method was designed by Engineer Deng with nearly half a year of effort. If you overturn his plan, you will offend him. Aren't we still working under him in the future? What if he has opinions about us? Xu Musen thought: Engineer Deng's construction plan did take effort, but using his plan would cause waste to the country. We must not be afraid of offending the engineer and allow the waste of national steel. He offered a guarantee to the leaders that he would be fully responsible if there was an accident with the wooden structure scaffolding and was willing to sign a guarantee to the leaders.
    This matter was discovered by the Party branch. The Party organization greatly encouraged Xu Musen on the one hand, and organized engineering and technical personnel to calculate the economic benefits of the construction plan and the pressure-bearing capacity of the wooden structure on the other hand, so as to submit it to the company. The accounting work was presided over by the trade union, and veteran workers, technicians, and Engineer Deng were invited to participate in the debate and repeated accounting.
    Once you do the math, it becomes clear which side the truth is on
    Once you do the math, it becomes clear which side the truth is on. If the steel structure plan of Engineer Deng is followed, 1,440 meters of four-inch seamless steel pipes, 14.38 tons of steel plates, more than 16,000 screws, 32 pulleys, and a bulky steel operating platform are required, totaling more than 50 tons of steel, which amounts to 34,438 yuan. If Xu Musen's wooden structure plan is followed, only 50 cubic meters of wood, 3,450 screws, and 8 pulleys are required, amounting to 12,549 yuan. Comparing the two plans, the wooden structure plan can save the country 21,889 yuan.
    Looking at the load of the wooden structure plan, the total load of all scaffolding and operating platform is 50 tons, and using twelve wooden columns with a cross-section of 150 cm in length and width as supports is bearable. According to calculations, the vertical stress of the weight that the twelve wooden supports can bear exceeds more than ten times the 50 tons. Since the scaffolding is too high, the object pressed on the scaffolding will be somewhat bent, which will generate bending stress. Ten tons of the 50 tons of weight is bending stress, and the bending stress that the twelve supports can bear also exceeds 1.5 to 1.6 times the 10 tons.
    In addition, even if the factors such as the difficult processing and ordering of steel plates in the steel structure plan and the difficulty in finding pulleys for a while are excluded, the production and installation of the steel frame is also a month slower than using wooden structures.
    When the two plans are accounted and compared at the meeting, it is clear that the wooden structure plan is a plan that is conducive to accelerating socialist construction. People say: The theoretical basis of the wooden structure plan is more, faster, better, and more economical. The truth is on the side of Xu Musen, an uncultured old worker.
    Xu Musen's creation has been realized
    Thanks to Xu Musen's daring to break superstitions and think boldly, his creation was finally realized with the support of the Party. Now, the wooden internal scaffolding has been towering into the clouds, and the concrete cylinder wall of the chimney has been poured to more than ten meters high. A month of construction practice has initially proved that the wooden structure scaffolding is easy to operate, and the output and safety are also very good. At the construction site, old worker Xu Musen often puts on his reading glasses and watches the progress of the project with concern. He leads the workers, working hard day and night, striving to complete the chimney project ahead of schedule. At that time, a brand-new item will be added to construction engineering, and wooden structure scaffolding can also be used for a hundred-meter-high chimney!

    凭什么根据
    ——记老工人徐木森的创造
  　本报记者　田良耕
    一百公尺高的烟囱有三十层楼房那么高，像这样大的家伙，全国也只有沈阳、吉林等地的建筑工程部门作过几个。云南锡业公司建筑工程公司还是第一次承建这样大的烟囱。因此，公司决定，烟囱由公司负责设计。
    用木结构代替钢结构内脚手架
    4月初，公司召集了一个专业会议。副主任工程师邓守为叙述了他经过几个月酝酿和设计的大烟囱施工方案。这个方案是以十二根无缝钢管作支柱，搭起钢铁内脚手架进行施工。这时，参加会议的七级老木工徐木森顿时起一个念头：钢材太贵，市面上又紧张，为什么不用木结构代替钢结构？他回忆起他曾负责先后建成的一个四十公尺高和一个六十公尺高的烟囱。这两个烟囱采用木结构搭脚手架，也挺安全，并且只有四根木头作支柱。徐木森当场提出木材代替钢材的建议。邓工程师认为，哪一本技术规范的书本上从没见过用木结构的道理。
    但是，徐木森的技术革新建议得到工地孙主任的支持和鼓励。徐木森绘出内脚手架木结构的设计草图，再到邓工程师处商量请示。
    你有理论根据吗？
    邓工程师自认为自己的设计，经过思考，找过理论，钢结构最为保险。一看徐木森的设计草图，不高兴地问：“凭什么根据？你有理论根据吗？”要理论根据！这可把小时只读过四年书，从十二岁就当学徒的老工人徐木森顶住了。心想：我家世世代代都是木匠，斗大的字也识不得几个，那里来的理论！真像一盆冷水泼在他头上，凉了半截。
    徐木森提到他过去施工烟囱的经验。邓工程师对他说：“老徐！你一百公尺高的烟囱没做过，云南的木材不好，含水量高，耐压力差、容易出问题。邓工程师劝他不要盲目乱干。说：“你没有文化，不会计算，万一出了事故，也讲不出道理来。而我的钢结构设计，有理论根据，出了毛病，打官司，我说得出理由。最后，邓工程师把自己设计的图纸拿给徐木森，嘱咐他好好看，将来照着施工。
    徐木森碰了钉子回来，怏怏不乐。心想：
    根据就是干过大烟囱
    凭什么根据？根据就是干过大烟囱，就是搞过四十年的木工经验嘛。
    一百公尺高的烟囱我没做过，可是四十、六十公尺高的做过。你邓工程师倒是真的一个也没做过。
    俗话说：“立木顶千斤。过去六十公尺高的烟囱内脚手架，用四根木头作支柱也耐得住压力，现在一百公尺高的烟囱用十二根木头作支柱搭脚手架，还顶不住吗？
    徐木森四十年来日日和木材作伴，各种木材的脾气摸熟了，他考虑再三，感到木结构的耐压力是有把握的。他把自己的设计草图放成大样，制成木头模型。请工地领导、技术人员和老工人共同研究。大家看了模型商量以后，都很同意。但是施工方法是钢还是木头架子仍不能最后确定。
    这时已是4月下旬了，施工方法一拖再拖，眼看雨季将临，负责烟囱施工的徐木森想：大好的干季不抓紧施工，拖到雨季施工，工程进度势必受到影响。一个深夜，在工地上，徐木森激动地向工地关副主任倾吐了自己的苦恼。关副主任一面安慰他，一面以工地名义作保证，向公司施工经理请示用木结构作架子，希望取得领导支持。这位经理一来对业务钻研不够，二来没有深入现场和人员研究，三来工地也没有提出材料，加上对烟囱施工怀着神秘观念。因此，关副主任一提出，就根据邓工程师的意见说：这可不是小事情呀，一百公尺高，用木结构怎样行呢？又问：你有计算资料吗？没有资料出了问题你们敢负责吗？关副主任被顶了回来。
    有些动摇了
    这时工地的行政领导上感到公司不同意也没办法，对徐木森的建议有些动摇了。公司把施工方法下达到工地，要工地照钢结构架子的图纸订货。徐木森知道公司没采纳他的建议之后，心里很难受。他怀着沉重的心情，一面根据图纸计算钢材数量准备订货，一面想着用木材既能节约钢材，又能加快工程进度的好处，觉得领导上为什么不同意他的建议呢？
    有些思想没有解放的人，也动摇起来。有的技术人员说：何必苦苦坚持，不管钢还是木头，领导决定用什么就用什么做吧，在工人中，和徐木森相好的私底下劝他说：老徐不要再坚持了，用钢结构的方法是邓工程师花了近半年的心血设计的，你如果把他的方案推翻了，得罪了他，以后我们还不是在他手下干活，他对我们有意见怎么办？徐木森想：邓工程师的施工方案确实是花了心血的，但是用他的方案就给国家造成浪费，决不能怕得罪工程师而听任国家钢材浪费。他向领导提出保证，用木结构架子若出了事故愿负全责，愿向领导签字保证。
    这件事被党总支发觉了。党组织一面对徐木森大加鼓励，一面组织工程技术人员计算施工方案的经济效果比较账和木结构承受压力的账，以便向公司提出。算账工作由工会主持，请老工人、技术人员并邀请邓工程师等参加，共同辩论和反复算账。
    一算账，真理在那一面一看就明白
    一算账，真理在那一面就明明白白了。如照邓工程师的钢结构方案施工，要用四寸无缝钢管一千四百四十公尺，钢板十四点三八吨、螺丝一万六千多只、滑轮三十二个和一个笨重的钢铁操作台，共需钢材五十多吨，合三万四千四百三十八元。用徐木森的木结构方案施工，只要用木材五十立方公尺、螺丝三千四百五十只，滑轮八个，合一万二千五百四十九元，两个方案一比较，木结构方案可为国家节约二万一千八百八十九元。
    再从木结构方案的负荷来看，全部脚手架和操作台的总荷重有五十吨，采用长宽各为一百五十公分断面的木柱十二根作为支柱是可承受的。据计算，十二个木支柱能承负的物体重垂直应力超过五十吨的十多倍。由于架子太高，物体压在架子上会有些弯曲，这就产生弯曲应力。五十吨重量有十吨是弯曲应力，而十二根支柱能负荷的弯曲应力也超过十吨的一点五到一点六倍。
    此外，即使把钢结构方案中的钢板加工订货较困难的滑轮一时不易找到等因素除开，钢架的制作和安装也比采用木结构要慢一个月。
    两个方案在会上这么一算账，一比较，显然，木结构方案是有利于加快社会主义建设的方案。人们说：木结构方案的理论根据就是多快好省。真理在没有文化的老工人徐木森一边。
    徐木森的创造实现了
    由于徐木森的敢破除迷信，大胆思想，他的创造终于在党的支持下实现了。现在，木结构的内脚手架已巍然高耸入云，烟囱的混凝土筒壁已浇灌到十多公尺高了。一个月的施工实践已初步证明：木结构架子操作方便，产量和安全也很好。工地上，老工人徐木森不时戴上老花眼镜，关心地注视工程的进度。他领导着工人，不分白天和黑夜的紧张施工，争取将烟囱工程提前完工。那时，建筑工程学上又将增添一项崭新的项目，一百公尺高的烟囱也能用木结构架子了！
