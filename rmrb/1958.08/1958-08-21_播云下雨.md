Cloud seeding for rain is one of the most vivid manifestations of modern humanity's control over the weather, with the main purpose of inducing rain from clouds that have not yet produced precipitation. The method involves scattering certain chemical substances into the clouds to enlarge the cloud droplets. When they become so large that the air can no longer support them, they turn into rain and fall to the ground. Many countries in the world, such as the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, Japan, and South Africa, have experimented with this method and achieved some success. These chemical substances either promote the formation of ice crystals in the clouds, which then enlarge and melt during their descent, turning into raindrops, or directly cause the cloud droplets to enlarge and become raindrops. The theory of cloud seeding for rain seems very simple, but the actual experimental techniques are quite complex. This work is also very useful for dissipating clouds and fog. For example, if there is fog on an airport runway and aircraft cannot land, this method can be used to dissipate the fog and allow aircraft to land safely. Another example is when an air force performance is held during a festival and clear skies are needed. This method can be used to make the clouds turn into rain and fall, resulting in clear skies, which is convenient for the aircraft's performance. Furthermore, in cases of prolonged drought, when reservoirs lack water for power generation and irrigation, this method can be used to increase the water level in the reservoirs and prevent power outages and work stoppages. Therefore, cloud seeding for rain is of great benefit to both industry and agriculture. Currently, cloud seeding for rain is limited to local area experiments worldwide, and the effectiveness of large-scale experiments has not yet been determined. Today, as the Chinese people are transforming nature with soaring enthusiasm, China's meteorological undertaking has also begun this ambitious experimental work. Although it is also a local area experiment, it has already achieved initial success. This work by the Jilin Provincial Meteorological Bureau will be carried out in other parts of China. We firmly believe that in the near future, this experiment will achieve even greater success in our country.

　　播云下雨
    播云下雨是现代人类控制天气的最生动的表现之一，主要目的在于促使未下雨的云下雨。方法是在云中播撒某些化学药品，使云滴变大，大到空气托不住的时候，就变成雨落到地上。这种方法世界上有许多国家如苏联、美国、英国、日本、南非等都曾经试用，也获得了某些成效。这些化学药品，有的是促使云中出现冰晶，然后使冰晶变大，在下坠中融化，变成雨滴，有的是促使云滴直接变大，变为雨滴。播云下雨的理论好像很简单，但在实际试验的技术上，却十分复杂。这种工作对于消云消雾，也有很大功用。例如机场跑道有雾，飞机不能下降，采用这种方法，即可将雾消散，使飞机安全着陆。又如节日进行空军表演，需要一个晴空，采用这种方法，便会使云层变成雨水降落，结果就可造成万里晴空，便于飞机的表演。又如由于久旱不雨，水库缺水发电、缺水灌溉，利用这种方法，可以使水库的水量增加，不致发生停电歇工现象。因此，播云下雨对于工农业都有很大好处。目前世界上播云下雨都只限于局部地区的试验，大范围试验的成效还没有定论。在我国人民以冲天干劲改造大自然的今天，我国气象事业也开始了这项豪迈的试验工作，虽然也是局部地区的试验，但是已经获得初步的成功。吉林省气象局的这种工作，在我国其他地方也将开展起来，我们深信不久的将来，这项试验在我国将获得更大的成就。
