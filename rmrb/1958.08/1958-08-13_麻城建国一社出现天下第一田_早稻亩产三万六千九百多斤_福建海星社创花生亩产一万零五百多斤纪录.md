Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th - Another dazzling achievement in early rice production in Macheng County, Hubei Province. According to a joint verification by the Hubei Province, Huanggang Prefecture, and Macheng County-level early rice high-yield inspection team, the Jian Guo First Agricultural Cooperative in Maxihe Township of the county created an astonishing record of an average yield of 36,956 jin of dry grain per mu on 1.016 mu of early rice field sown with "Jiangxi Early" seeds. As of now, this is the "champion" among the large number of high-yield "satellites" launched in China's bumper early rice harvest, exceeding the previous early rice high-yield records set by Shima Township Gao Feng Agricultural Cooperative in Zongyang County, Anhui Province, and the Second Agricultural Cooperative in Pingjing Township of the same county by more than double.

The main cultivators of this high-yield field in the Jian Guo First Cooperative were the cooperative director Wang Qiancheng, deputy director Feng Fubing, cooperative committee member Wang Maogang, and the second production team leader Luo Xuejiang, all of whom are Communist Party members. Many cooperative members (mainly young members) also actively participated in the cultivation work.

The harvesting of this high-yield field began on August 8th and was not fully inspected and accepted until the 11th. The three-level inspection team included Shi Linfeng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee, Han Yusheng, Deputy Director of the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and Hou Shangwu, Secretary of the Macheng County Party Committee Secretariat; in addition, there were hundreds of representatives from various townships and cooperatives in Macheng County. Jiang Yi, the First Secretary of the Huanggang Prefectural Party Committee, also participated in some of the inspection work. The area of this field was repeatedly measured and determined to be 1.016 mu. Originally, it was to be completely harvested, but in order to allow representatives from other places to visit, 0.242 mu were left unharvested. The entire harvesting process was carried out jointly by the inspection personnel and cooperative members, including reaping, threshing, winnowing, and weighing. Adding the actual inspection figures to the estimated production figure for the 0.242 mu of land, the total output of this field was 37,547 jin of dry grain, with an average yield of 36,956 jin of dry grain per mu.

This early rice high-yield record that people dared not imagine is the result of boldly innovating with the full spirit of communism. It is understood that this field was tilled a total of ten times, with deep plowing reaching more than one chi (foot). A total of five applications of base fertilizer and top dressing were applied, with a total of 3,000 jin of grass seeds, 1,000 dan (1 dan = 100 jin) of pond mud, 400 dan of aged brick soil, 105 jin of ammonium sulfate, 80 jin of superphosphate, 60 dan of liquid manure, and 180 jin of bean cake being applied successively. The base fertilizer was applied in layers in conjunction with plowing, ensuring that each layer had fertilizer. The density of transplanting was actually very difficult to calculate by the number of seedlings, because the rice in the entire field was tightly packed together. During the inspection, people selected an area of one square chi for actual measurement. According to the actual measurement results, it was estimated that there were approximately 7.68 million ears per mu. Rolling eggs casually on top of the rice stalks would not cause the eggs to fall into the field. It can be seen to what extent the field was densely planted.

The main measures that promoted the high yield of this field have gradually become clear. Initially, people had some doubts about deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, and dense planting, so they only plowed seven cun (inches) deep, used less fertilizer, and only achieved a planting density of one cun between seedlings and four cun between rows. About a month after transplanting, high-yield miracles of wheat continued to appear in various places, with multiple places achieving yields of over 5,000 jin per mu. This was a great encouragement to the people cultivating this experimental field. They said, "If wheat can yield more than 5,000 jin per mu, why can't rice yield more than 10,000 jin per mu?" They were determined to conduct a high-yield experimental test with a yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu and took corresponding measures, which were to deepen the cultivated layer, apply sufficient fertilizer, and increase the density. At this time, the seedlings had grown to more than one chi (foot) high, but they still resolutely pulled up these seedlings and carried out another plowing, harrowing, and cultivating (to make the soil fine and broken), so that the cultivated layer reached a depth of one chi, and increased the amount of fertilizer applied. Then, they transplanted the seedlings from this field and several other fields into this field, forming a highly dense planting with a number of seedlings that was difficult to distinguish. Because the seedlings grew extremely densely, it was impossible to enter the field, which brought many difficulties to field management, but people overcame it with collective wisdom. For example, to apply top dressing, the fertilizer could not be applied to the soil, so they devised a way to open ditches around the field and use pipes to irrigate the field with water and fertilizer. They also adopted the method of propping up the rice to prevent lodging and constantly fought against drought.

The news of the high yield of early rice in the Jian Guo First Cooperative has spread throughout Macheng County, and many people in areas adjacent to Macheng also know about the news. In recent days, about four to five thousand people have come to visit from various townships in the county and from other places every day. On the 11th, Zhang Ziming, director of the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Zhang Qishan, deputy director of the Jiangxi Agricultural Science Research Institute, Wang Xingwu, deputy director of the Hunan Agricultural Science Research Institute, and other agricultural experts, who were attending a meeting in Wuhan, also made a special trip to visit. Visitors generally believe that human wisdom and the potential of nature are endless.

Now, Wang Qiancheng, Feng Fubing, and others are even more motivated, and the cooperative members are all enthusiastic. They have decided to continue to promote and develop the successful experience of deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, and dense planting by using the method of transplanting seedlings, and strive to achieve even greater bumper harvests in late rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th - Macheng County, Hubei Province, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice. The early rice in this county has now been basically harvested. According to repeated calculations of the actual harvest situation, the average yield per mu of the county's 73,000 mu of early rice reached 1,232 jin, which is more than twice as high as last year; and eleven townships have an average yield per mu exceeding 2,000 jin. A large number of high-yield fields have also emerged throughout the county, including 4,900 mu with an average yield per mu of 3,000 jin to 5,000 jin; 1,190 mu with an average yield per mu of 5,000 jin to 7,000 jin; more than 530 mu with an average yield per mu of 7,000 jin to less than 10,000 jin; more than 30 mu with an average yield per mu of 10,000 jin and above, with the highest average yield per mu being 36,956 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 12th - Farmers in Shengli Township, Nan'an County, Fujian Province, located on the frontline of coastal defense, have created a new record of over 10,000 jin per mu of peanuts while persevering in the struggle against the enemy and doing a good job in production. Recently, members of the Haixing Cooperative harvested a total of 11,663 jin of dry peanuts from a 1.107 mu peanut experimental field, with an average yield of 10,535 jin per mu, exceeding the bumper harvest record of 8,302 jin per mu of peanuts created by the Yinghu Cooperative in Longhu Township, Jinjiang County, by 2,233 jin.

The creators of this bumper harvest record are Zhuo Qingshu, captain of the third production team of the Haixing Agricultural Cooperative, technician Zhuo Fuqiu, veteran farmer Zhuo Shuichou, and young female cooperative members. The peanut experimental field they planted is very close to the sea, and like the large areas of farmland in the township, it is only dozens of li away from Jinmen Island. This achievement was achieved in the struggle to closely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland's coastal defense gate, while striving for a bumper harvest.

    麻城建国一社出现天下第一田
　　早稻亩产三万六千九百多斤
　　福建海星社创花生亩产一万零五百多斤纪录
    新华社武汉12日电　湖北省麻城县的早稻生产又放异彩。根据湖北省、黄冈专区和麻城县三级早稻高产验收团联合查验证实，这个县的麻溪河乡建国第一农业社，在一点零一六亩播种“江西早”种子的早稻田里，创造了平均亩产干谷三万六千九百五十六斤的惊人纪录。截至目前，这是我国早稻大丰收中放射出的大批高产“卫星”中的“冠军”，它比安徽省枞阳县石马乡高丰农业社及本县平靖乡第二农业社先后创造的早稻高产纪录高出一倍以上。
    建国一社的这块高产田的主要培育人，是这个社社主任王乾成、副主任冯福炳、社委王茂刚和第二生产队队长罗学江，他们都是共产党员，许多社员（主要是青年社员）也积极地参加了培育工作。
    这块高产田从8月8日开始收割，到11日才全部验收完毕。参加三级验收团的有湖北省人民委员会副秘书长史林峰、华中农业科学研究所副所长韩玉生、中共麻城县委书记处书记侯尚武；此外，还有麻城县各乡、社代表共数百人。中共黄冈地委第一书记姜一，也参加了一部分验收工作。这块田经反复丈量确定面积为一点零一六亩。本来要全部割完，为了给外地代表参观，留下零点二四二亩未割。收获的全部过程都是由验收人员和社员们一起收割、打场、扬场和过秤的。把实打验收数字和那零点二四二亩田的测算估产数字加在一起，这块田的总产量共为干谷三万七千五百四十七斤，平均亩产干谷达三万六千九百五十六斤。
    这个人们所不敢想的早稻高产纪录，是充分发挥共产主义风格大胆革新的成果。据了解，这块田整地共达十次，深耕达一尺以上。共施底肥、追肥五次，先后施用的肥料计有草籽三千斤、塘泥一千担、陈砖土四百担、硫酸铵一百零五斤、过磷酸钙八十斤、水粪肥六十担、豆饼一百八十斤。底肥是结合犁地分层施用的，作到了层层有肥。插秧的密度，实际上已经很难用多少蔸来计算了，因为整块田的稻子都是一根紧靠一根的。在验收时，人们曾选一平方尺的面积进行实测，据实测结果推算，平均每亩约有七百六十八万穗。把鸡蛋随便地放在复盖着稻禾上面滚动，鸡蛋始终不会掉到田里去。可见这块田的禾密到了什么样的程度。
    促使这块田高产的主要措施，是逐渐明确的。开始时，人们对深耕、肥足和密植都存在着一些疑虑，所以只犁了七寸深，肥料也较少，密植只作到株距一寸、行距四寸。插秧后约一个月，各地小麦高产奇迹不断出现，亩产达到五千斤以上的已有多处。这对培育这块试验田的人们是一个很大的鼓舞。他们说：“小麦能亩产五千多斤，水稻为什么不能亩产万多斤呢？”他们决心搞亩产万斤以上高额丰产试验，并且采取了相应的措施，这就是加深耕层、施足肥料、加大密度。这时，秧苗已经长到一尺多高了，但他们仍毅然把这些秧苗拔起来，又进行了一犁、一耙、一耖（将土整细碎），使耕层深达一尺，并且增施了肥料，然后，又把本田的秧和另外几亩田的秧，一起植到这块田里，形成为蔸数难分的高度密植。因为苗长得极密，根本无法下田，给田间管理带来了许多困难，但人们用集体智慧战胜了它。例如，要追肥，但肥料却怎么也下不到泥里去，他们就想法在田的四周开沟，用管子把水肥灌到田里去。他们还采用打撑的办法防止倒伏，并且不断地向干旱作了斗争。
    建国一社早稻高产的消息已经传遍了整个麻城县，在和麻城临近的地区，也有很多人知道这个消息了。连日来，每天从本县各乡和外地前往参观的约有四、五千人。11日，正在武汉开会的华中农业科学研究所所长张子明，江西农业科学研究所副所长张岐山，湖南农业科学研究所副所长王星五，以及其他农业专家等多人，也专程前往参观和访问。参观者们普遍认为，人的智慧和大自然的潜力是无穷无尽的。
    现在，王乾成、冯福炳等人的劲头更足了，社员们也个个热情高涨。他们已决定用掇秧的办法，继续推行和发展深耕、肥足和密植的成功经验，力争晚稻获得更大的丰产。
    据新华社武汉12日电　湖北省麻城县的早稻获得了空前未有的大丰收。这个县的早稻目前已经基本收割完毕，根据对实收情况的反复核算，全县七万三千多亩早稻，平均亩产量达一千二百三十二斤，比去年提高二倍强；并有十一个乡平均亩产量突破了二千斤。全县还涌现了大批高产田，其中平均亩产量达三千斤到五千斤的有四千九百亩；五千斤以上到七千斤的有一千一百九十亩；七千斤以上到不足一万斤的有五百三十多亩；一万斤和一万斤以上的有三十多亩，最高的平均亩产三万六千九百五十六斤。
    据新华社福州12日电　处在海防前线的福建省南安县胜利乡农民，在边坚持对敌斗争边搞好生产中，创造了花生亩产万斤以上的新纪录。最近海星社社员在一亩一分零七毫的花生试验田里共收割干花生一万一千六百六十三斤，平均亩产一万零五百三十五斤，超过晋江县龙湖乡英湖社创造的花生亩产八千三百零二斤的丰产纪录二千二百三十三斤。
    这个丰产纪录的创造者，是海星农业社第三生产队队长卓清术、技术员卓夫求、老农卓水抽和青年妇女社员。他们种植的这丘花生试验田，距海边很近，和全乡大片农田一样和金门岛只相隔几十华里。这个成绩是在一面紧密配合解放军保卫好祖国海防大门，一面争取丰产丰收的斗争中取得的。（附图片）
