　　Today's Cambodia
    Under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, Cambodia is striving to eliminate the aftermath of colonial rule and build a completely independent economy and new national culture. In recent days, people have seen the government pass a series of decrees and take one measure after another to achieve the above goals; they have also seen the masses of people bravely advancing under the call of the government.
    More than eighty years of long colonial rule have brought disastrous consequences to Cambodia in all aspects. Cambodia was originally a country with excellent natural conditions. From the air, overlooking Cambodia, the vast Mekong River runs through the north and south, the vast Tonle Sap Lake lies in the center, and extends to the four sides with the Tonle Sap River (downstream called Tonle Bassac), the Sun River, the Sangker River, and the Pursat River, irrigating the surrounding provinces. Large and small lakes are even more dotted. Except for the mountains in the northwest and southwest, the entire Cambodia is a vast plain, mostly covered with forests. Cambodia has a hot climate (average annual temperature of 28 degrees Celsius) and abundant rainfall, with an annual average rainfall of about 1,400 millimeters, which is suitable for crop growth and should have high yields.
    However, during the eighty years of colonial rule, agricultural economy did not develop much (not to mention industry). Cambodian farmers still cultivate extensively, using very simple farm tools, and even preserve slash-and-burn cultivation. When people walk through the Cambodian wilderness, they can see scorched ground and stumps, and during the planting season, wildfires are everywhere. In most areas, rice is harvested only once a year, with an average yield of only 150 catties per mu (1.1 tons per hectare). Cambodia basically has no water conservancy system, and cannot avoid alternating water and drought disasters throughout the year. The most famous water conservancy project now is still the West Baray Lake water conservancy project (near the Angkor ruins in Siem Reap Province) left over from more than a thousand years ago. The reporter has crossed the fields of Cambodia many times, and the deepest impressions are: cracked fields and dry riverbeds and ditches under the scorching sun; women carrying clay pots from afar to fetch a little water to drink; only heat-resistant palm trees in the fields are still dark green.
    During the French colonialists' rule over Cambodia, they vigorously developed rubber plantations, which were monopolized by them and yielded generous profits. The French only began planting rubber in Cambodia in 1921, but by 1937 it had expanded to 27,500 hectares, and continuously adopted the latest technology. This is in stark contrast to the backward state of Cambodian agriculture.
    The situation is even more serious in other economic sectors. In addition to monopolizing rubber, French capitalists also almost monopolized the production of electricity and tap water throughout Cambodia, and held an absolute advantage in finance, shipping, import and export, and some industrial enterprises. Cambodia's oil supply is monopolized by three foreign oil companies: Mobil, Shell, and Caltex. What can be called Cambodia's own industry is truly unique. The market is flooded with foreign goods, and not a single drop of the 30 million Cambodian riels of beer consumed in Cambodia each year is made in Cambodia.
    This deformed phenomenon in the economy is reflected in finance: more than 70% of the national budget revenue comes from commercial import and export taxes and various business taxes, and taxes from production account for less than 3%. Prince Sihanouk recently said: "At present, our annual expenditure is about 5 billion Cambodian riels, and our own income can only pay 2.6 billion Cambodian riels, and the rest depends on foreign aid." He also lamented: Foreign aid puts us in a humiliating position.
    The Cambodian government is starting some reforms on this basis: In June of this year, the Cambodian government acquired all the rights and properties of the French electricity and tap water companies and their subsidiaries for a price of more than 90 million Cambodian riels, and changed it to a Cambodian company (capital of 150 million Cambodian riels) with government investment accounting for the majority, in order to engage in production and development to meet the needs of the country. Subsequently, the Cambodian government took over a French rubber plantation of more than 240 hectares and began to establish the first company with Cambodian state capital accounting for the majority to develop its own rubber production. In order to protect the development of fragile national industries such as matches and agriculture, the Cambodian government has also promulgated a ban on the import of matches, firecrackers, vegetables, fruits, and some canned goods. These measures have been warmly welcomed by the Cambodian public.
    The agricultural development plan, centered on water conservancy construction, is also being vigorously promoted. News from various provinces shows that officials in various provinces have led farmers to actively repair ditches, build dams, and dig wells to revitalize water conservancy. I once saw a moving scene of Cambodian farmers building a dam: under the scorching sun, more than a hundred farmers were hammering the earthen dam with wooden sticks; they had neither excavators nor rammers, only working with their bare hands; but in front of my eyes, an earthen embankment one meter high, three meters wide, and fifty meters long had already appeared. China's aid of 25 million Cambodian riels has been used for agricultural development, most of which has been used for water conservancy construction.
    In places where crops have already grown, the Cambodian government is leading farmers to prevent pests, especially the harm of field mice. Recently, an unprecedented rat extermination campaign is underway here. News from Battambang said that with the help of personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture, farmers acted in unison on the same day and released poisoned rat medicine in a vast area; afterwards, in Mongkol Borei alone, more than two million dead rats were found; in Sisophon, they recently fought against about one million rats that were rampant in destroying crops. I have seen these very harmful rats at the People's Social Alliance achievement exhibition. They are large and fat, one of which is 24 centimeters long and the tail is 25 centimeters long.
    In addition, the government also distributes improved varieties and distributes good breeding cattle to farmers to increase production. I have visited a livestock farm built with Chinese aid. The spacious site and lush environment show the government's emphasis on this work. It is foreseeable that Cambodia's economy will be considerably developed under these measures of the government.
    The colonialists' huge bureaucracy, coercive exploitation, and luxurious lives also left a destructive legacy: people are enthusiastic about officialdom, despise labor, especially various physical labors, and some officials are corrupt and degenerate. Prince Sihanouk called them "serious social crises" and launched a fierce attack on them. He vividly explained the situation in this regard: "Our country is like a person with a head weighing several tons (this head is our administrative agency, and its salary expenditure accounts for more than 60% of the total budget expenditure of the country), a transparent body, and weak limbs." He said: Many Cambodian young people demand to be officials as soon as they come out of school, and are unwilling to participate in industrial, agricultural, and commercial labor, and some even swear never to do such lowly work. Parents also think "learning is for becoming an official." He said: This has fatally struck the foundation of the country's prosperity and the importance of production.
    Fighting this crisis is not a simple matter and must "lead by example," so Prince Sihanouk decided to set an example "from above." Recently, he led his cabinet ministers and members of the two houses of parliament to personally participate in a physical labor to dig reservoirs for farmers. On July 22, Chia Langde Village near Kampong Chhnang City in Kampot Province suddenly became the focus of national attention. Thousands of people participated in the labor on this day, and even the wives of Prince Sihanouk and some other senior officials cut hair and nails for the children of nearby residents. This was the most sensational event in Cambodia's history, and it became the headline news of every newspaper and the center of street gossip. Prince Sihanouk also stipulated that government personnel and members of parliament must go to the countryside once a month to participate in physical labor. The government also decided to set up a "work camp" to accommodate young people who leave school, provide them with food and accommodation, but they must participate in public works, urban cleaning, and industrial and agricultural labor. After this, it has been common to hear that ministers or provincial governors lead their subordinates to participate in physical labor. Almost all newspapers praised and supported this new measure; even Thai newspapers praised it.
    Also in order to start "from above," under the instructions of Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian government recently searched the residences of some nobles who were gambling and taking drugs at home, and arrested some gamblers and drug addicts, including princes and noble ladies. Measures to prevent corruption are also being strictly implemented in the government and the army. These bold measures have also aroused enthusiastic welcome from public opinion.
    I have visited the famous Angkor ruins of Cambodia several times, recalling the glorious ancient civilization of Cambodia on these still magnificent sites. I couldn't help but think of this question: Why can the Cambodian people, who were able to create such a high degree of civilization more than 700 years ago, be so unknown today. I can't help but think of some of my surprised emotions when I first arrived in Cambodia: many Cambodian officials and students speak French more easily than their native language, and they actually use French to communicate with each other; most of the textbooks in bookstores are published in France, but there is not a single history and geography book compiled by Cambodia itself; elementary school students start learning French when they start learning. French culture and the French way of life are so familiar to people. This sharp contrast naturally leads me to an answer: this is the inevitable result of colonial rule.
    In eliminating the aftermath of colonial rule, the Cambodian government has made special efforts to establish its own national culture. First, look at some of the following figures: 1936: 1,077 schools, 674 teachers, and 56,895 students; 1953 (the year of independence): 2,430 schools, 3,825 teachers, and 245,754 students; 1957 increased to: 3,183 schools, 7,848 teachers, and 426,631 students. The development of national education is very obvious. The state's expenditure on education has increased year by year, from more than 290 million Cambodian riels in 1955 to approximately 600 million Cambodian riels in 1958.
    Cambodian elementary schools have now partially adopted textbooks compiled by the country, and Cambodian language courses have also been added to middle schools. The trend of Cambodian officials speaking Cambodian when meeting each other is gradually being established. The government has also implemented the regulations that government documents and commercial reports should be mainly in Cambodian; domestic letters must be written with addresses and names in Cambodian. Most shops have also switched to Cambodian signs. The recently published "Literature" bimonthly has made improving Cambodian and making it easy for people to master as one of its goals. Cambodian language is restoring its due status and the dignity of a true national language. People will also inevitably see that a new, national Cambodian culture will soon be carried forward and inherit the glory of ancient times.
    The young Cambodia is moving forward in this way, embarking on its own independent development path. Victory must belong to the brave Cambodian people! August 12, Phnom Penh

　　今日柬埔寨
    柬埔寨在西哈努克亲王的领导下，正在为清除殖民主义统治的恶果，为建设完全独立的经济和新的民族文化而努力。在最近一些日子里，人们看到政府通过了一连串的法令，采取了一个又一个的措施来实现上述目标；也看到人民群众在政府的号召下奋勇前进。
    八十多年漫长的殖民主义统治，给柬埔寨在各方面都带来了灾难性的后果。柬埔寨本来是一个自然条件极好的国家。从飞机上鸟瞰柬埔寨，坦荡的湄公河流贯南北，浩瀚的洞里湖仰卧中央，并且向四方伸出洞里河（下流叫洞里百细）、孙河、桑哥河和菩萨河，流灌周围的省份。大小湖泊更是星罗棋布。除西北与西南有山脉以外，整个柬埔寨是一个大部分覆盖着森林的肥沃的大平原。柬埔寨气候炎热（年平均温度为摄氏二十八度），雨量丰富，每年平均雨量约一千四百多公厘，宜于农作物生长，产量应该是很高的。
    但是在殖民统治的八十多年中间，农业经济却没有什么发展（工业更不用说了）。柬埔寨农民至今耕作粗放，使用非常简单的农具，甚至还保存刀耕火种。当人们走过柬埔寨的原野时，就可以看到烧焦的地面和树桩，耕种季节更是野火四起。绝大部分地区稻谷每年才一熟，平均亩产只合一百五十斤（每公顷一点一吨）。柬埔寨基本上没有水利系统，终年不能免除交替出现的水旱灾害。现在最著名的水利工程，还是一千多年前遗留下来的西巴莱湖水利工程（在暹粒省吴哥古迹附近）。记者曾经多次越过柬埔寨的田野，印象最深的是：烈日下龟裂的田地和干枯的河道、沟渠；妇女们顶着瓦罐老远地去取一点吃的水；田野里只有耐热的棕榈树还发着深绿色。
    法国殖民主义者统治柬埔寨期间，却大力发展了为它所垄断、获利优厚的橡胶种植。法国人在1921年才开始在柬埔寨种植橡胶，到1937年就已经扩大到二万七千五百公顷，而且不断采用最新的技术。这和柬埔寨农业的落后状态形成了鲜明的对照。
    其它经济部门，情形更严重。法国资本家除了垄断橡胶，也几乎垄断了全柬埔寨的电力和自来水生产，并且在金融、航运、进出口以及一些工业企业中占有绝对优势。柬埔寨的石油供应由美孚、壳牌和卡尔特斯三家外国石油公司垄断。可以称得上柬埔寨自己的工业，真是绝无仅有。市场上充斥着外国商品，柬埔寨每年消耗的三千万柬元的啤酒也没有一滴是柬埔寨制造的。
    经济方面的这种畸形现象，反映在财政上是：国家预算收入的70％以上来自商业进出口税和各种营业税，来自生产方面的税收还不到3％。西哈努克亲王最近说：“目前，我们每年的支出大约要五十亿柬元，我们本身的收入只能支付二十六亿柬元，其余的要依靠外援”。他并且感慨地说：外援使我们处在屈辱的地位。
    柬埔寨政府正是在这个基础上开始了一些改革：今年6月，柬埔寨政府以九千多万柬元的代价，首先收购了法国电力和自来水公司以及它的子公司的全部权利和财产，改由一个由政府投资占多数的柬埔寨公司（资本一亿五千万柬元）来管理，以便适应国家的需要来从事生产和发展。接着，柬埔寨政府接收了一个有二百四十多公顷的法国橡胶园，开始成立第一个由柬埔寨国家资本占多数的公司，来发展本国的橡胶生产。为了保护脆弱的火柴等民族工业和农业的发展，柬埔寨政府又颁布了禁止火柴、爆竹、蔬菜、果类和一些罐头的入口。这些措施受到柬埔寨公众的热烈欢迎。
    以建设水利为中心的发展农业计划也正在大力推行。来自各省的消息表明：各省官员都已经领导农民积极修沟、打坝、挖井，振兴水利。我曾经看到柬埔寨农民修水坝的一个动人场面：在烈日下，一百多个农民拿着一根根的木棍捶打着土坝；它们既没有挖土机，也没有打夯的硪，只有赤手空拳地干；但在我眼前已经出现了一个高一公尺、宽三公尺、长五十公尺的土堤。中国的援助已有二千五百万柬元被用作发展农业之用，其中大部分又用来建设水利。
    在庄稼已经成长起来的地方，柬埔寨政府正在领导农民防止虫害，特别是田鼠的危害。最近，一个空前的灭鼠运动正在这里展开，来自马德望的消息说：在农业部人员的帮助下，农民在同一天内，一致行动，在广大地区内施放毒鼠药物；事后，仅蒙哥波里地方，发现被毒死的老鼠就在二百万只以上；在西索风，最近又向约一百万只猖獗破坏庄稼的老鼠作战。我曾在人民社会同盟政绩展览会上看到过这些危害很烈的老鼠，它们身躯肥大，其中一只身长二十四公分，尾长二十五公分。
    此外，政府也散发优良品种、分配良种耕牛给农民以增加生产。我曾参观过一个用中援修建的畜牧场，宽大的场址和水草丰茂的环境，表现了政府对这一工作的重视。可以预见，柬埔寨的经济将在政府的这些措施下，得到相当的发展。
    殖民主义者庞大的官僚机构、强取豪夺的剥削手段和养尊处优的生活，也留下来破坏性的遗产：人们热中官场，贱视劳动，特别是各种体力劳动，部分官员贪污腐化。西哈努克亲王把它们称为“严重的社会危机”，而向它发动猛攻。他生动地说明这方面的情况：“我们的国家好比一个人有着一个几吨重的脑袋（这个脑袋就是我们的行政机构，它的薪金支出占用了国家全部预算支出的60％以上），一个透明的身躯和衰弱的四肢。”他说：许多柬埔寨年青人从学校出来就要求做官，不愿参加工、农、商业劳动，有的并且发誓绝不做这种下贱工作。父母们也认为“学习为了做官”。他说：这使国家的富强和生产的重要基础遭到了致命的打击。
    和这种危机作斗争并不是简单的事，必须“以身作则”，因此西哈努克亲王决定由“上面”来树立榜样。最近，他率领他的阁员和两院议员们亲自参加了一次为农民挖蓄水池的体力劳动。7月22日，贡不省磅乍叻市附近的齐阿琅德村顿时成为全国注意的中心。这一天上千人参加了劳动，连西哈努克亲王和另一些高级官员的夫人也为附近居民的孩子剪头发和指甲。这在柬埔寨是从未有过最轰动的事件，它成为每家报纸的头条新闻和街谈巷议的中心。西哈努克亲王并且规定政府人员和议员，以后每月必须下乡参加一次体力劳动。政府还决定设立一个“工作营”来收容离开学校的青年，供给他们住食，但要参加公共工程、城市清洁和工、农业劳动。在这以后，部长们或省长们率领部下参加体力劳动已时有所闻了。差不多所有报纸都赞扬和拥护这个新措施；甚至泰国报纸也加以赞扬。
    也是为了从“上面”做起，柬埔寨政府在西哈努克亲王指示下，最近搜查了一些在家里聚赌、吸毒的贵族的住宅，逮捕了一些赌徒和吸毒犯，其中有亲王和贵族夫人。杜绝贪污腐化的措施也正在政府、军队中严厉地实行起来。这些大胆的措施也已经引起舆论的热烈欢迎。
    我曾经几次访问过柬埔寨著名的吴哥古迹，在这些仍然是十分壮伟的遗址上，缅怀着辉煌的柬埔寨的古代文明。我不得不想起这样一个问题：为什么能够在七百多年前创造这样高度文明的柬埔寨人民，今天却这样默默无闻。我不能不想起我刚到柬埔寨时的一些惊讶情绪：不少柬埔寨官员和学生讲法文比本国话更容易，他们之间平时竟用法语交谈；书店里大部分是法国出版的教科书，却找不到一本柬埔寨自己编著的历史和地理书；小学生在开始学习时，也就开始学习法文了。法国的文化、法国的生活方式，人们是那样习惯了。这种鲜明的对比，使我很自然地得出了一个答案：这就是殖民主义统治的必然结果。
    在消除殖民主义统治恶果中，柬埔寨政府在建立自己的民族文化上作了特别的努力。先看下面的一些数字：1936年：学校一千零七十七座，教员六百七十四人，学生五万六千八百九十五人；1953年（独立的一年）：学校为二千四百三十座，教员三千八百二十五人，学生二十四万五千七百五十四人；1957年更分别增加为：学校三千一百八十三座，教员七千八百四十八人，学生四十二万六千六百三十一人。民族教育的发展是十分明显的。国家用于教育的经费逐年增加，1955年为二亿九千余万柬元，1958年激增到约六亿柬元。
    柬埔寨小学目前已部分采用本国编写的教材，中学也增加了柬文课。柬埔寨官员见面讲柬语的风气逐渐在树立。政府也已执行政府公文来往、商业禀章以柬文为主的规定；国内信件必须用柬文书写地址姓名。大多数商店也已改用柬文招牌。最近出版的“文学”半月刊，更把改进柬文，使人民易于掌握作为自己努力的目标之一。柬文、柬语正在恢复它应有的地位和真正的民族语言的尊严。人们也必然会看到新的、民族的柬埔寨文化不久将会发扬光大，继承起古代的光辉。
    年青的柬埔寨就是这样在前进，走上自己独立发展的道路。胜利一定属于勇敢的柬埔寨人民！　8月12日于金边
