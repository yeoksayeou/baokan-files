　　A Wonderful Portrayal

    United Press International sent a dispatch introducing Vice Admiral Beakley, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. It began by writing: "A man nicknamed 'Attack' today—as he has for many months—suddenly assumed one of the world's most uneasy and difficult jobs of defending peace." This is truly a wonderful portrayal. It's just like saying that a habitual "arsonist" suddenly took on the job of "firefighter."

    This is by no means a careless slip of the pen by the UPI reporter. The following text makes it clear: the Seventh Fleet has been ordered to take "preventive defense measures" in the Taiwan Strait, and it also boasts that the Seventh Fleet's "destructive power is greater than that of all the fleets in the world before atomic fission," which shows that this dispatch was originally intended to scare people. Wanting to make frightening faces, yet posing as a guardian of "peace"; already occupying our Taiwan, yet saying that it wants to "avoid taking any action that might have the flavor of aggression," this is truly difficult for the American journalist's pen. As a result, he had to write "Attack" as a talisman of "peace." And this, in turn, perfectly portrays the cowardly and hypocritical face of the American aggressor.

　　The Crow Laughs at the Pig for Being Black

    The British semi-official newspaper "Straits Times" in Singapore recently said that the reason why the landing of American troops in Singapore has been condemned by people of all countries seems to be entirely because the American naval spokesman once stated that the American troops' entry into Singapore "is to protect friendly countries in the Indian Ocean affected by the Middle East crisis." The newspaper also believes that this approach by the United States is "stupid." According to the logic of the "Straits Times," if the American troops stay quietly, it seems that no one will "talk." The fact is, of course, not like this. No matter whether the American pirates make a sound or not, since they are doing things that threaten peace, they cannot escape the condemnation of world public opinion. This bandit behavior of the United States is certainly stupid, but I wonder if the "Straits Times" also thought of Britain itself when it laughed at the United States. This time, Britain has tattooed the words "den of thieves" in gold on its own face, is it any smarter? The words of the "Straits Times" have a bit of the flavor of "the crow laughs at the pig for being black."

　　札记
　　绝妙的写照
    美国合众国际社发了一条专电介绍美国第七舰队司令比克利海军中将。一开头就写道：“一位绰号叫“‘攻击’的人，今天——正如他在漫长的许多个月以来一样——突然担任起世界上保卫和平的最不安逸、最困难的工作之一了”。这真是绝妙的写照。正如同说，一个“放出”的惯犯，今天突然担任起“救火”的工作一样。
    这绝不是合众国际社记者笔下的疏忽。下文说得明白：第七舰队已经奉命在台湾海峡采取“预防性防御措施”，又吹嘘什么第七舰队的“破坏力比原子分裂前世界上一切舰队的威力都大”，可见这条专电原就是想要吓唬人的。又想作出吓人的鬼脸，又要扮成“和平”的守护神；已经侵占了我国台湾，又说要“避免采取可能有侵略行动味道的任何行动”，这可真难为美国记者先生那支笔了。结果，他只好把“攻击”写成“和平”的护符。而这样一来却正好画出了美国侵略者那副卑怯的假冒伪善的嘴脸。
　　老鸦笑猪黑
    新加坡的英国半官方报纸“海峡时报”最近说，美军登陆新加坡之所以受到各国人民的谴责，似乎完全是因为美国海军发言人曾经声明美军进驻新加坡“是保护受到中东危机影响的印度洋内友好国家”。这个报纸并且认为美国的这种做法是“傻头傻脑”的。照“海峡时报”的逻辑，美军如果不声不响地呆下去，似乎就不会有人“说话”了。事实当然不是这样。不论美国海盗们吭不吭气，他们既然干着威胁和平的勾当，就不能逃避世界舆论的谴责。美国的这种强盗行径固然愚蠢，但是不知道“海峡时报”在嘲笑美国时，是否也想到英国自己。这次英国给自己脸上刺了一行“强盗窝主”的金印，难道就更聪明些吗？“海峡时报”的话颇有点“老鸦笑猪黑”的味道。
