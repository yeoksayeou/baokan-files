　　See if he can still disbelieve!
　　Wang Junfeng, Deputy Commander of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Coking Plant Construction Site
　　On the afternoon of the day the No. 1 Coke Oven System Project of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Coking Plant was completed, a victory reporting team of more than 300 people, with flags and banners waving and gongs and drums beating, marched spiritedly around the site towards the location of the general party committee – the Workers' New Village.
　　As the team entered the Workers' New Village, Master Li, who was preparing to go on the second shift, shouted to me, "Comrade Wang, do you still remember that European who said we wouldn't be able to produce coke by 'September 1st'?"
　　"I will never forget it."
　　"We should write to him and invite him to come again, so that the facts can teach him a good lesson."
　　"He didn't leave an address." I said as I walked, but the image of that European was vividly before my eyes.
　　It was one morning in May when a journalist from a capitalist country, accompanied by a comrade from the Foreign Affairs Section, came to the coking plant construction site.
　　The engineer and I, according to the time notified by telephone, received him near the coke screening building.
　　This journalist was tall, with blond hair, and his deep-set eyes were hidden behind brown-tinted glasses. From his camera with the lens cap off and his peering around, it could be seen that he was very interested in the scale of the coking plant. He said pretentiously:
　　"In my country, I have been to iron and steel joint enterprises for interviews more than once." He casually spread out his notebook and asked, "What is the scale of the coking plant?"
　　"It includes raw coal preparation, coking, and chemical engineering workshops, covering an area of nearly sixty hectares." The engineer replied briefly.
　　"What is the output?"
　　"Each furnace produces 1,200 tons of coke day and night." I interjected, "The first phase has a total of four, and then we will do the second phase. After the Great Leap Forward, it may develop even larger."
　　The journalist shrugged and changed the topic: "When did construction start, and when will it be completed?"
　　"Construction started last May, and we guarantee coke production by 'September 1st' this year."
　　"Can you guarantee it?" The journalist rolled his eyes.
　　"Not only guarantee, but absolutely guarantee." Master Li, who was cleaning equipment parts, answered for us.
　　The journalist was surprised by this sudden interjection: "Who are you?"
　　"I am an installation worker." Master Li stopped working.
　　"How can a worker know the completion date?"
　　"Because guaranteeing 'September 1st' coke production was proposed by us workers in the Great Leap Forward plan."
　　"What?"
　　The translator repeated it again, but he still didn't understand.
　　Master Li quietly moved closer to my ear and asked with a sneer, "Is this person deaf, or is he deliberately pretending not to understand?"
　　"He is definitely not deaf," I thought for a moment, "He probably doesn't understand the words 'Great Leap Forward plan' because this term is very likely not found in the dictionary of their country."
　　The people around laughed, and the journalist shrugged again.
　　"How long did the furnace body installation take?" The journalist asked Master Li a second question like an exam.
　　"The plan was twenty days, but it actually took eleven days, nine days ahead of schedule." Master Li answered fluently.
　　"What about bricklaying?"
　　"That is not the task of the installation workers," the engineer quickly took over, "The construction period was three Great Leap Forwards, a total of fifty-nine days, thirty-one days ahead of schedule."
　　The journalist recorded, and then asked:
　　"Why can every project be ahead of schedule?"
　　"Please let the worker comrades answer the questions raised by the journalist!" I said.
　　Without waiting for the journalist to express his opinion, Master Li continued, "In our country, there is no exploitation between people, and labor is for everyone's happiness. Therefore, the workers have all exerted their greatest labor enthusiasm."
　　"We not only work hard, but we also work skillfully," Carpenter Zhang, who was standing beside him, also said a few words to the journalist.
　　It seemed that the journalist did not quite believe the workers' talk, so he asked the translator to tell everyone to talk about some specific examples.
　　Master Li said, "The workers suggested using integrated installation for the more than seventy-ton tippler, which resulted in advancing the construction period by twenty-five days."
　　Carpenter Zhang said, "Our carpenters created a mobile electric saw, a multi-blade bamboo splitter..."
　　"When laying the refractory bricks for the furnace body," the engineer added, "Tiler Ding Yongkui went to work two hours early, but Ding Bingwu went to work even earlier than him. In order not to fall behind Ding Bingwu in progress, Ding Yongkui resolutely did not go down to the furnace to eat breakfast. The party branch secretary brought him fried dough sticks, he bit a fried dough stick and laid a brick, not wasting any time...."
　　Hearing this, the journalist suddenly stopped recording. He looked up and looked around, trying to find facts to refute our unexaggerated talk. He saw that the water and sewer pipes had not yet been completed, he heard that the more than two-meter-thick gas pipes had not yet been made, and he learned that there were still hundreds of pieces of equipment that had not been transported and thousands of tons of equipment that had not been installed. Therefore, when he said goodbye to us, he said decisively:
　　"Thank you for your introduction. However, I still don't believe you can produce coke by 'September 1st'."
　　I replied, "Whether coke can be produced by 'September 1st', I don't want to argue with you. Let the facts be the conclusion!"
　　The journalist returned to his country. I have no way of knowing how he reported on Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, but in the two months after he returned to his country, the construction speed of the coking plant became even faster. Ditches and tunnels like blood vessels connected the entire plant; the coal conveying trestle bridge seemed like a long rainbow in the clouds. In July, the general party committee issued a battle call to "work hard for twenty days and strive to complete construction by August 1st," and the construction site was boiling. The responsible comrades of the general party committee inspected every day, the leaders of the construction units went to the site in person, and many workers stayed up all night. The high temperature of over thirty-seven degrees Celsius could not shake the determination of the builders. The missing equipment also received support from many machinery manufacturing plants in other places, and the army used airplanes to help the coking plant transport reducers. Therefore, three months of work was completed in twenty days, so that the No. 1 coke oven system project was fully completed on July 31, fifty-five days ahead of the state plan.
　　An engineering project that lasted more than a year was only completed fifty-five days ahead of schedule, which is nothing in this leaping era where "one day equals twenty years," but when we think of that European journalist who never believed that coke could be produced by "September 1st," we can't help but excitedly and solemnly say: The No. 1 coke oven system project of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation was completed before "September 1st." I wonder if he still believes it in the face of the facts?

### 看他还能不相信？

　　看他还能不相信？
　　武钢炼焦化工厂工地副指挥长　王峻峰
    武钢焦化厂一号焦炉系统工程竣工的那天下午，三百多人组成的报捷队，旗画招展，锣鼓喧天，雄赳赳地绕道现场，向总党委所在地——工人新村进发。
    当队伍进入工人新村时，准备上二班的李师傅对我大喊：“王同志，你还记得那个说我们‘九·一’出不了焦的欧洲人吗？”
      “一辈子也忘不了。”
    “该写信请他再来一趟，让事实好好教训教训他。”
    “他没有留下地址。”我边说边走，可是，那位欧洲人的形象，却活现在我的眼前。
    那是5月里的一个上午，有一位资本主义国家的记者，在交际科同志的陪同下来到了焦化工地。
    我和工程师按着电话通知的时间，在筛焦楼附近接待了他。
    这位记者，高个子，黄头发，茶色眼镜遮盖着深陷的眼窝。从他那开着盖的照像机和东张西望的表情中，可以看出他对焦化厂的规模很感兴趣。他装腔作势地说：
      “我在国内，曾不止一次的到钢铁联合企业采访。”他随手摊开日记本。问道：“焦化厂的规模有多大？”
    “它包括原煤准备、炼焦、化工三个车间，占地近六十公顷。”工程师简要地回答。
    “产量呢？”
    “每座炉子昼夜产焦一千二百吨。”我在一旁插嘴道：“第一期共四座，接着还搞第二期，跃进之后，可能发展得更大。”
    记者耸耸肩头而且转换了话题：“何时开工，何时建成？”
      “去年5月开工，保证今年
  ‘九·一’出焦。”
      “能保证？”记者翻翻眼皮。
      “不仅保证，而且绝对保证。”正在清理设备零件的李师傅替我们回答。
    记者对这突如其来的插语感到惊奇：“你是什么人？”
    “我是安装工人。”李师傅停止了工作。
    “工人怎么能知道建成日期？”
      “因为保证‘九·一’出焦是我们工人在跃进规划中提出的。”
      “什么？”
    翻译又重复一遍，可是他还说不明白。
    李师傅悄悄的靠近我的耳朵，冷笑着问道：“这人是聋子，还是故意装不懂？”
    “可以肯定他不聋，”我思索了一下：“大概是听不懂‘跃进规划’这几个字，因为在他们国家的词典上很可能查不到这个名词。”
    围在旁边的人都笑了，记者又耸了耸肩头。
    “炉体安装用了多长时间？”记者考试似地对李师傅提出了第二个问题。
      “计划二十天，实际用了十一天，提前九天。”李师傅对答如流。
      “砌砖呢？”
      “那不是安装工人的任务，”工程师连忙把话接过来：“工期三次跃进，共用五十九天，提前三十一天。”
    记者记录着，然后又问道：
      “为什么项项工程能提前？”
      “请工人同志们回答记者提出的问题吧！”我说。
    没等记者表示意见，李师傅便接着说：“在我们的国家里，人和人之间没有剥削，劳动是为了大家的幸福，因此，职工们都发挥了最大的劳动干劲。”
    “我们不光是苦干，而且还会巧干，”站在一旁的木工张师傅，也对记者说了两句。
    看样子，记者对工人的谈话不大相信，因而让翻译告诉大家谈一些具体例子。
    李师傅说：“七十多吨重的翻车机，职工们建议采用整体安装，结果使工期提前二十五天。”
    张师傅说：“我们木工创造了移动电锯，多刀破竹器……”
      “在砌炉体的耐火砖时，”工程师补充说：“瓦工丁永奎早两点就上班，可是丁丙午比他上班还早，丁永奎为了不使进度落在丁丙午的后边，坚决不下炉吃早饭，党支部书记把油条送到他跟前，他咬一口油条，砌一块砖，不浪费一点时间……。”
    听到这里，记者忽然停止了记录，他抬头环视，企图寻找事实，来驳斥我们毫不夸张的谈话。他看见上下水道还没有完成，他听说两公尺多粗的煤气管还未制作，他了解到尚有几百件设备没有运来，几千吨设备没有安装，因而，在同我们告别时，便斩钉截铁的说道：
      “谢谢你们的介绍。可是，我始终不相信你们能在‘九·一’出焦。”
    我回答说：“‘九·一’能否出焦，我不想和你争论，等着让事实作结论吧！”
    记者回国了。他对武钢究竟如何报道，我无从得知，然而，在他回国后的两月之内，焦化厂的建设速度更快了，地沟、隧道血管似的连贯全厂；输煤栈桥好像云端的长虹。7月间，总党委发出了“苦战二十天，力争八一建成”的战斗号召，工地沸腾了，总党委负责同志天天检查，施工单位的领导者亲临现场，很多工人彻夜不眠；三十七度以上的高温，也动摇不了建设者们的决心。缺少的设备，也得到了外地许多机械制造厂的支援，部队用飞机帮助焦化厂运减速器。因此，三个月的工作，二十天就完成了，使一号焦炉系统工程于7月31日全部竣工，比国家计划提前五十五天。
    工期逾年的工程，仅仅提前五十五天，这处在“一天等于二十年”的跃进时代，本来算不得什么，然而，当我们想到那位始终不相信“九·一”能够出焦的欧洲记者的时候，便不得不兴奋而郑重的说一声：武钢一号焦炉系统工程，没有等到“九·一”就建成了。不知他在事实面前还相信不相信？
