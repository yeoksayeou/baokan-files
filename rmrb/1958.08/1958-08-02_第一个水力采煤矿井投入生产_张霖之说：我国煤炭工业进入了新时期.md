    Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, August 1st: China's first hydraulic coal mine – the Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine hydraulic coal mine – was officially put into production yesterday.
    Yesterday morning, more than two thousand people held a grand production ceremony. At the beginning of the ceremony, Zhang Linzhi, Minister of the Coal Industry, said in his speech that the official commissioning of this hydraulic coal mine marks the entry of China's coal industry into a brand new era, stepping into the world's advanced coal mining science and technology field, and is a good start to climbing the peak of world coal mining technology.
    Han Guang, Acting Director of the State Technology Commission, Gao Shuxun, Deputy Governor of Hebei Province, and Leonik, the leader of the Soviet expert group assisting China's coal industry construction, also spoke at the meeting.
    After the speeches, Zhang Linzhi, Minister of the Coal Industry, awarded two prize banners woven with "Rocket" to the staff of the Tangshan Coal Science Research Institute and Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine for the rapid construction of China's first hydraulic coal mine.
    Then, Zhang Linzhi cut the ribbon, and the mine was officially put into production. At this time, the raw coal mined by hydraulic mining was continuously sent to the ground washing plant through a long hydraulic transportation and lifting method; after dewatering and washing, it was loaded into the train, and people's cheers and applause drowned out the roar of the machines and the whistle of the locomotives. The water flow ejected from the water gun cuts off the coal seam like a sword and mines the coal. (Attached picture)

    第一个水力采煤矿井投入生产
    张霖之说：我国煤炭工业进入了新时期
    据新华社唐山1日电　我国第一个水力采煤矿井——开滦唐家庄矿水力采煤矿井昨天正式投入生产。
    昨天上午，有两千多人举行了隆重的生产典礼。典礼大会开始时，煤炭工业部部长张霖之致词说，这个水力采煤矿井的正式投入生产，标志着我国煤炭工业进入了一个崭新的时期，跨入了世界采煤先进科学技术的领域，是攀登世界采煤技术高峰的良好开端。
    国家技术委员会代理主任韩光、河北省副省长高树勋、帮助我国进行煤炭工业建设的苏联专家组长列奥尼克等也在会上讲了话。
    讲话结束以后，煤炭工业部部长张霖之把两面织有“火箭”的奖旗，分别授予为迅速建成我国第一个水力采煤矿井的唐山煤炭科学研究院和开滦唐家庄矿的职工。
    接着，张霖之剪彩，矿井正式投入生产。这时候，利用水力开采出来的原煤，经过长长的水力运和提升的方法，源源不断送到地面洗选厂；经过脱水和洗选，装入火车以后，人们的欢呼声和鼓掌声响成一片，淹没了机器的轰鸣和机车的呼号。水枪喷射出来的水流像剑一样，削断煤层，将煤采下来。（附图片）
