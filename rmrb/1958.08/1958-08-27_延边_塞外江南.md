Yanbian - A Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall
　　Mao Dun
    It has already been mentioned that the amateur agricultural university of the Dong Sheng Township's Liming Cooperative has fully realized the principle of combining learning and labor, theory and practice; now let's look at how the regular universities, middle and primary schools are doing. As far as I can see, labor has become a regular course in all levels of regular schools in Yanbian.

    For example, the Second Central Primary School in Yanji City has more than two thousand students, aged seven to fifteen, with no overage children. The main labor is agricultural labor and handicraft labor, with thirty mu of land, and workshops for leather making (using scrap leather to make handbags, which are very beautiful), fly swatter making, knitting, etc. The thirty mu of land is mainly used to grow soybeans, potatoes, castor beans, sunflowers, winter melons, etc. Labor time: students in the third and fourth grades work two hours a week, students in the fifth and sixth grades work four hours a week; students in the first and second grades do not participate in the above-mentioned labor, but have one hour of street cleaning labor per week. High-grade students also have one rural activity per week - visiting and laboring. In addition, there are various social service labor activities. Students in the third grade and above in this school have learned several production skills such as gardening, animal husbandry, carpentry, and candy making. From last winter to this spring, the students collected a total of 8.25 million kilograms of manure, planted 821 trees, planted 1,500 ping of oil crops, and collected 3,460 kilograms of scrap iron, 3,944 kilograms of glass, made 1,883 grass bags, and made 63,172 kilograms of rope. Labor has transformed people. A fifth-grade student who used to steal things has completely changed now, is very active in labor, became the director of the fly swatter workshop, and joined the Young Pioneers.

    Another example is the Second High School and the Third High School. The former has 1,300 students, with 8 qing of practice land, more than 80 qing of farms, and an iron factory (manufacturing simple agricultural tools); the latter has more than 700 students, with 5.5 qing of practice land (campus), 100 qing of farmland, of which 40 qing have been cultivated, and a practice factory is being established. In the past, students worked two hours a week, but now it is stipulated that 24 classes are completed in four days a week, and the remaining two days are completely devoted to labor. The labor income of students in these two schools has reached or exceeded one-half of the school's funding.

    Yanbian University was the first to propose that students' participation in labor be a formal course. The university's agricultural college is basically part-work and part-study, with more than 20 qing of farms and more than 200 qing of orchards. To teach in the fields, teachers must have practical knowledge. Teachers plant experimental fields. All odd-job workers are completely eliminated, and cattle, sheep, and pigs are all raised by students and teachers. The agricultural college has achieved self-sufficiency.

    The Normal College of Yanbian University (not in the same place as the Agricultural College and the Medical College) is divided into eight departments with more than 700 students. Approaching this college, one immediately sees the fruits of the students' labor; the campus surrounding the school buildings is very large, and vegetables and fruit trees are planted everywhere. This is labor education outside of the practice workshop.

    Student family composition: 80% of the students in the Central Primary School are children of cadres, and 20% are children of peasants; more than 98% of the students in the Second High School are children of workers and peasants, and more than 85% of the students in the Third High School are children of workers and peasants; 95% of the students in Yanbian University are children of workers and peasants. The Central Primary School is located in Yanji City, so most of the students are children of cadres. This also reflects that primary school education in Yanbian has long been popularized in rural areas.

    The Yanbian Art School was newly built in 1957. Now (referring to March of this year) there are only thirty-six male and female students, divided into three departments: music, dance, and fine arts (the fine arts department was only established a few months ago). I watched the students' music and dance performances and was deeply impressed. These young students, who have grown up in the excellent national song and dance traditions, seem to be talented and are willing to put in the effort to learn. The main course in dance is national dance, and it also teaches folk dances of domestic fraternal nationalities and basic ballet training. Korean dance has been danced quite skillfully. As for basic ballet training, if you think about the fact that they have only been learning for half a year, you will feel that their current level is commendable. The disadvantage is that their physical strength is a little poor. Five or six girls in their teens performed for more than ten minutes, and they were all a little out of breath.

    The goal of this young art school is to cultivate backbone members of mass cultural activities, and students in the dance department must learn choreography. This art school will recruit more than fifty new students in the second half of the year.

    In addition to teaching, the art school also runs two types of training classes. One is the "Mass Amateur Art Training Class" for cultural centers and club art backbones, and the other is the "Children's Amateur Art Training Class," which is attended by primary and junior high school students. The latter has taught seven- and eight-year-old little artists (piano and violin) who can perform on stage. At one grand evening party, the amateur performers included children, as well as old men and women.

    The Yanbian Song and Dance Troupe has two teams, opera and folk song and dance, with more than ninety people in total, and the level is very high. Some of the folk song and dance programs have not been seen elsewhere, such as "The Day My Husband Left." This is a classical dance, with two groups of men and women, with graceful and vigorous symmetry, full of optimism. The story is about: the husbands are about to go on an expedition, and the wives fetch water by the stream to see them off. The husbands expressed their confidence in bravely killing the enemy, and the wives watched the husbands walking away with big strides in a sentimental and optimistic mood. I like this dance very much. From content to form, this is a complete work of art. The opera troupe performed the large-scale opera "Kong Ju and Pan Ji." Those who have seen this play, especially those who have seen the performance of this play by the National Opera House of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, will definitely worry about the Yanbian opera team of dozens of people (in addition to the orchestra, the folk song and dance team and the opera team together are only six or seventy people, and some actors in the folk song and dance team cannot participate in the opera performance, so the actual number of people is very small), and the stage for the performance is not up to standard in terms of width, height, and depth. How can they perform this large-scale opera well? But they performed very well. There is no secret, in addition to the artistic attainments of the actors, it also depends on the spirit of overcoming difficulties and collectivism. They have no full-time stage staff, and the actors all work together to build sets and place props; many actors play multiple roles during the performance, and after playing this role, they go offstage, change clothes, and come back to play another role. Without a backstage, the actors are crowded in a small area under the stage to put on makeup. I watched the magnificent sets built on such a narrow and shallow stage, and I couldn't help but admire the skills of the stage art designers. In short, this troupe has truly achieved more, faster, better, and more economical!

    I visited the headquarters of this song and dance troupe. The garden is very large, there are not many houses, and the garden is full of vegetables, which is the result of the troupe members' labor. They also repaired a large number of fruit trees in the garden that had not been maintained for many years. In the near future, these fruit trees will repay their hard work. They are artists, and at the same time they are agricultural laborers. I guess they will also run small factories in the future!

    Because the geographical location is a bit remote, not only do foreign song and dance and theater troupes rarely come to Yanbian to perform, but also domestic song and dance and theater troupes rarely tour there. The members of the Yanbian Song and Dance Troupe are eager to see other people's performances so that they can learn from them and broaden their horizons. I think this wish is reasonable. The relevant parties should consider this wish and try to satisfy it partially. [This section is to be continued, the full text is not finished]

　　延边——塞外江南
　　茅盾
    东盛乡黎明社的业余农业大学完全实现了学习和劳动、理论和实践相结合的原则，这是上面已经说过的了；现在再来看正规的大、中、小学是怎样的。据我所见，劳动已经成为延边各级正规学校的正规课程了。
    例如延吉市第二中心小学，学生二千多，学生年龄七—十五岁，没有超龄儿童。主要劳动是农业劳动和手工业劳动，有土地三十亩，有皮革制作（利用碎皮制手提袋，十分美观）、制蝇拍、针织等等车间。三十亩土地，主要种植大豆、土豆、蓖麻、向日葵、冬瓜等等。劳动时间：三、四年级学生每周二小时，五、六年级学生每周四小时；一、二年级学生不参加上述各项劳动，但每周有一小时的街头清洁劳动。高年级学生每周还有一次到农村活动——参观和劳动。此外，还有各种各样的社会服务劳动。这个学校三年级以上的学生都学会了园艺、畜产、木工、制糖果等几种生产技能。去冬今春，学生共拣粪八百二十五万公斤，栽树八百二十一棵，种油料作物一千五百坪，拣废铁三千四百六十公斤，玻璃三千九百四十四公斤，打草袋一千八百八十三只，打绳六万三千一百七十二公斤。劳动改造了人。一个经常偷东西的五年级学生现在完全变了，劳动很积极，当了制蝇拍车间的主任，加入了少先队。
    又如第二高中和第三高中，前者学生一千三百人，有实习土地八垧，农场八十多垧，还有铁工厂（制造简单农具）；后者学生七百多，实习土地（校园）五垧半，农场一百垧荒地，已开垦四十垧，实习工厂正在建立。过去，学生每周劳动两小时，现在规定一周二十四节课四天完成，其余二天时间完全劳动。这两个学校的学生劳动收入，都已经达到或者超过全校经费的二分之一。
    延边大学是首先创议把学生参加劳动作为正式课程的。该校的农学院基本上就是半工半读，农学院有农场二十多垧，果木园二百多垧。到田间教书，教员非有实际知识不可。教员种试验田。勤杂工完全取消，牛羊猪都是学生、教员喂养。农学院已经达到自给自足。
    延大的师范学院（和农学院、医学院不在一处），分八个系，学生七百多人。走近这个学院，立刻就看到学生们劳动的果实了；围绕校舍的校园很大，到处都种了菜蔬和果树。这是实习工场以外的劳动教育。
    学生家庭成分：中心小学80％的学生是干部子弟，20％是农民子弟；第二高中98％以上的学生是工农子弟，第三高中85％以上是工农子弟；延大学生95％是工农子弟。中心小学是在延吉市内的，所以学生多为干部子弟。从这里也反映出延边的小学教育早已普及到农村了。
    延边艺术学校是1957年新建的，现在（指今年3月）只有三十六名男女学生，分音乐、舞蹈、美术三个系（美术系只成立了几个月），我看了学生们的音乐舞蹈表演，印象很深。在民族的优秀歌舞传统中生长起来的这些青年学生看来是有才能的，而且肯下功夫学习。舞蹈的主要课程是民族舞，也教国内兄弟民族的民间舞蹈和芭蕾舞基本训练。朝鲜舞已经跳得相当熟练。芭蕾舞基本训练呢，如果想到他们学的时间不过半年，也就觉得他们目前的水平是难能可贵的。吃亏的是体力差些。十几岁的五、六个女孩子表演了十多分钟，都有点气喘了。
    这个年青的艺术学校的培养目标是群众文艺活动的骨干分子，舞蹈系的学生都要学编导。这个艺术学校下半年将招新生五十多名。
    教学之外，艺术学校还办了两种训练班。一是文化馆、俱乐部的文艺骨干参加的“群众业余文艺训练班”，又一是“儿童业余文艺训练班”，参加者是小学和初中的学生。后者已经教出了可以上台表演的七、八岁的小艺术家（钢琴和小提琴）。有一次盛大的晚会，业余表演者的节目就有儿童的，也有老大爷和老大娘的。
    延边歌舞团有歌剧和民间歌舞两个队，共九十多人，水平都很高。民间歌舞的有些节目，我在别处尚未见过，例如“丈夫离去的那天”。这是一个古典舞，男女两组，婀娜和刚健对称，充满了乐观气氛。故事大意是：丈夫们要出征了，妻子们在溪边取水送行，丈夫们表示了英勇杀敌的信心，妻子们在惜别而乐观的情绪中遥望丈夫们大踏步走了去的远影。我很喜欢这个舞。从内容到形式，这是一个完整的艺术品，歌剧团演出了大型歌剧“孔菊和潘姞”。看过这个戏的，特别是看过朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国立歌剧院演出这个戏的人，一定会耽心延边的这个几十人的歌剧队（除了乐队，民间歌舞队和歌剧队合计也不过六、七十人，而民间歌舞队中有些演员还不能参加歌剧演出，因此实际人数是很少的），而且演出的舞台在宽、高、深三方面又都不合标准，如何能演好这个大型歌剧。可是他们演得很好。没有什么秘诀，除了演员们的艺术造诣，还靠有克服困难的干劲和集体主义的精神。他们没有专职的舞台工作人员，搭布景、摆道具，都是演员们大家动手；不少演员在演出时身兼数角，刚扮演过这个角色的，下场换了服装又上来演另一个角色了。没有后台，演员们挤在台下的一小块地方化装。我看了在那样窄而浅的舞台上，搭出那样富丽堂皇的布景，就不能不赞美舞台美术设计者的本领。总而言之，这个剧团，真正做到了多快好省！
    我访问过这个歌舞团的团部。园子很大，房子不多，满园子种了蔬菜，这是团员们劳动的成果。他们还把园子里多年没有得到培修的大批果木树培修起来。不久的将来，这些果木树就会报答他们的辛勤的劳动。他们是艺术家，同时又是农业劳动者，我猜想他们将来还会办小工厂呢！
    因为地理位置偏了一点，不但外国来的歌舞、剧团很少到延边演出，就是国内的歌舞、剧团的巡回演出，也不到那里。延边歌舞团的团员们迫切希望看到别人的表演，以资观摩，以广见闻。我认为这种愿望是合理的。有关方面，应当考虑他们的这种愿望，设法给予部分的满足。〔本节续完，全文未完〕
