Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: The rectification movement in the central state organs, as of the beginning of August, has seen nearly 90% of its departments and bureaus conclude the Red vs. Expert debate, marking the victorious end of a great and historically significant rectification movement lasting fifteen months.

Currently, many units that have concluded the Red vs. Expert debate have completed their personal ideological summaries, formulated personal Red and Expert plans, and mobilized the masses to widely summarize the experiences of the rectification movement. Through this summary, the rich experiences of the rectification will be carried forward as valuable assets.

各机关认真严肃地进行了整风复查和补课，特别是深入检查和处理了领导干部中遗留的问题
All organs have conducted conscientious and serious rectification reviews and supplementary lessons, especially in-depth investigations and handling of problems left over among leading cadres.

In order to conclude the rectification movement well and strive for complete victory, all units of the central state organs have conducted conscientious and serious rectification reviews and supplementary lessons, especially in-depth investigations and handling of problems left over among leading cadres. In some units, leading cadres had disagreements on some major policies and guidelines, resulting in prolonged uncoordinated relationships, some of which developed into organizational decentralism and serious disunity. Some individual leading cadres displayed serious individualism; some made right-leaning opportunist errors in politics; and some even developed to the point of opposing the Party and its leadership. These problems were fully exposed and seriously criticized during the rectification supplementary lessons. At the concluding stage of the rectification, resolutely making up for this lesson is of great significance for removing obstacles on the road of the Great Leap Forward in the future, strengthening Party unity, and smoothly implementing the Party's General Line.

采用群众路线方法，发动全体干部进行整风总结，使这些经验深入人心，进而发挥更大作用
Adopting the mass line method, mobilizing all cadres to summarize the rectification, so that these experiences are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and then play a greater role.

The entire process of the rectification movement was essentially a great debate and struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies. Like other parts of the country, the central state organs, after fifteen months of vigorous rectification and anti-rightist struggle, have achieved significant gains and rich experiences. Recently, many units that have concluded the rectification have held exhibitions of the rectification achievements. These exhibitions vividly demonstrated the process of ideological liberation and the beautiful picture of the Great Leap Forward in thought and work. In order to obtain the rich experiences of the great rectification movement, and to use these experiences to carry out the technological and cultural revolution movements, many units have adopted the mass line method of combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, mobilizing all cadres to summarize the rectification. The First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power have adopted this method of summarization. The General Office of the State Council also launched a "Hundred Articles Movement," calling on everyone to write about their experiences and insights from the rectification. In the summary, profound insights were gained on issues such as the long-term and complex nature of the two-road struggle during the socialist transition period, the issue of putting politics in command, the mass line and the leadership method of adopting mass movements, and the application of the new forms of socialist democracy such as great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, as well as the great significance of continuously liberating thought with "virtual" leading "real" and "red" leading "expert". Because the method of mass movement was adopted to summarize the rectification, this can not only enrich the experience and help to raise the experience from the masses and practice to the level of theory; but also enable the masses to consciously grasp these experiences, so that these experiences are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and then play a greater role.

把整风运动结束好，把技术革命、文化革命开始好。整风运动结束，标志着一个新的革命运动开始
Concluding the rectification movement well, and starting the technological revolution and cultural revolution well. The end of the rectification movement marks the beginning of a new revolutionary movement.

The end of the rectification movement marks the beginning of another new revolutionary movement. On the 11th, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs convened a meeting of the heads of the various rectification leading groups, focusing on how to victoriously conclude the rectification and how to carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution after the rectification movement.

Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, spoke at the meeting. He said that this moment is very important. We must victoriously conclude the rectification movement and start well the tasks of implementing the General Line and carrying out the technological revolution and cultural revolution. The two tasks are different, but the movement must not stop and must be well connected. Of course, there are breaks in the middle of the movement, which is to summarize experiences. Immediately after the break is the Great Leap Forward, not standing still.

Regarding how to conclude the rectification movement well, Xi Zhongxun said that first, the rectification movement must be resolutely carried out to the end. Some units have not yet completed the rectification and must persevere to the end; if shortcomings are found in units that have already concluded, they can still squeeze out some time to make up for the lesson. In addition, the supplementary lessons for leading cadres are very important. In the past, the timing for solving these problems was not yet ripe, and some problems were not obvious in the past. Now that the movement has reached a certain temperature, we should make up our minds and boldly expose the problems. In this way, some old problems that have not been solved for several years can be solved quickly. Some problems should not be seen as small problems, as they will develop into serious problems if they are not solved. In short, if the problems of leading cadres are not thoroughly resolved, it will be a "half-cooked meal" for the rectification movement, and there will be difficulties in the leap forward in the future.

To conclude the rectification movement well, all organs must also conscientiously summarize the experiences of the rectification movement. This summary is also the beginning of the study of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, and this work should not be neglected. Not being good at summarizing experience is a manifestation of empiricism, and we often made this mistake in the past. The summary of the rectification should form a mass movement, and only by adopting the method of the mass line can we better summarize the rich experiences.

充分认识思想改造的长期性、艰巨性。应该经常敲起警钟，防止麻痹和自满
Fully recognize the long-term and arduous nature of ideological remolding. We should always sound the alarm to prevent paralysis and complacency.

In his speech, Xi Zhongxun once again emphasized the long-term and arduous nature of ideological remolding. He said that the fourth stage of the rectification is the individual's ideological revolution, a re-understanding of oneself. We must not overestimate the achievements of the fourth stage. It is a right-leaning view to think that after this Red vs. Expert debate, the red flag has been planted and that the red flag will never fall in the future. Now it is only the beginning of understanding, and ideological remolding is still long-term and arduous. In the central state organs, some veteran cadres were expelled from the Party for making serious mistakes because they relaxed their ideological remolding, which is a serious lesson. Therefore, ideological remolding must also be a continuous revolution. Many people do not understand this principle and should be sounded the alarm frequently. Especially after the rectification has passed, or when some achievements have been made in the Great Leap Forward, we must especially prevent paralysis and complacency.

Xi Zhongxun said that the so-called "starting well" also means "connecting well." We must make full use of the rectification experience of more than a year to carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution movements. We must let the General Line penetrate the hearts of the people, make all cadres understand the spirit and essence of the General Line, further mobilize people's spirit, create a vigorous situation, and set off a climax of the Great Leap Forward.

To carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution movements, the goals must be clear, the measures must be specific, and we must not shout empty slogans. All organs must put forward clear requirements and incorporate them into the overall plan; at the same time, they must focus on grasping measures and grasping the advanced, and use the advanced to lead the backward.

Regarding theoretical study, Xi Zhongxun said that at present, we should focus on grasping the study of the General Line and the correct handling of contradictions among the people. We must study Chairman Mao's thought, improve our Marxist-Leninist level, and constantly liberate our own minds to promote the Great Leap Forward of the work of the organs. This is an important task in the technological revolution and cultural revolution movements. There must be two combinations in learning, that is, it must be combined with the actual work and ideological reality of the unit. He proposed that the method of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters can also be adopted for learning. For example, what are your views on the General Line? You can air your views for a few days, then start a great debate, and finally mobilize everyone to summarize. In this way, everyone is a student and a teacher, because the things that are aired are good teaching materials, very rich actualities, and also the "target" that the "arrow" of Marxism-Leninism is to shoot at. Therefore, adopting this mass line method to study can better combine theory with practice. At the same time, in the future, the method of airing views and debates can also be adopted to study philosophy.

下一步的任务是认真贯彻总路线，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，促进机关工作的全面大跃进。在这方面仍然必须进行艰巨的思想斗争和政治斗争
The next task is to conscientiously implement the General Line, actively carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and promote the overall Great Leap Forward in the work of the organs. In this regard, we must still carry out arduous ideological and political struggles.

Regarding the Party's work after the end of the rectification movement, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs put forward some preliminary opinions based on the practices of advanced units. The Party Committee believes that how to better start the next movement on the basis of the victory of the rectification is a very urgent issue. In the central state organs, the next task should be to conscientiously implement the General Line of socialist construction, actively carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and promote the overall Great Leap Forward in the work of the organs.

First of all, we should conscientiously implement the idea of "continuous revolution". The Party Committee believes that the idea of continuous revolution has not been fully understood by cadres or even some leading cadres. For example, after a new task is put forward, some organs have the erroneous ideas of "exceptionism" and "conditionalism." They believe that the technological revolution and cultural revolution are only matters for the technical and cultural departments, and non-technical and cultural departments cannot carry them out. They do not understand that all organs and all cadres should be mobilized without exception to actively participate in this movement. The direction of the revolutionary movement in non-technical and cultural departments should be to fight against all conservative ideas and resolutely implement the General Line; that is to say, every organ and every staff member should be mobilized to exert full effort, strive for the upper reaches, and make every effort to make the business work of their respective industries enter a new situation of the Great Leap Forward, thus also participating in the ranks of the overall technological revolution and cultural revolution. The situation shows that to implement the General Line, actively carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and promote the overall Great Leap Forward in the work of the organs, we must still carry out arduous ideological and political struggles. This struggle includes not only the struggle between the two ideas of advanced and conservative, but even the struggle between the two roads.

贯彻总路线开展技术革命、文化革命运动，同整风运动一样，也是一个全民性的群众运动，同样的要目标明确、任务具体、口号响亮、方法对头，也要有安排、有步骤、有节奏、有进度。有了明确的方向和具体任务，还必须有好的方法。党委会认为，举办展览会，开现场会议，以及“五献”（即元旦、三八、五一、七一、十一向党献礼）“四比”（即比政治、比干劲、比风格、比贡献）的作法，都是有效的方法。
Implementing the General Line and carrying out the technological revolution and cultural revolution movements, like the rectification movement, is also a mass movement of the whole people. Similarly, the goals must be clear, the tasks must be specific, the slogans must be loud, and the methods must be correct. There must also be arrangements, steps, rhythm, and progress. With a clear direction and specific tasks, there must also be good methods. The Party Committee believes that holding exhibitions, holding on-site meetings, and the practices of "Five Offerings" (ie, offering gifts to the Party on New Year's Day, March 8th, May Day, July 1st, and November 1st) and "Four Comparisons" (ie, comparing politics, comparing enthusiasm, comparing style, and comparing contributions) are all effective methods.

掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮，学习也可以同样运用大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的方法
Set off a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works, and learning can also use the methods of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters.

Regarding how to set off a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works, the meeting mentioned that in the future, the central state organs will spend about a year, roughly divided into three units, to specifically study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's General Line. These three units are: the General Line during the period of socialist construction, the issue of two different types of contradictions, and philosophy ("On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as the main documents). The Party Committee requires that the study must implement the spirit of linking theory with practice, and the methods of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters in the rectification movement can also be applied to theoretical study. The organizational form of study can adopt the principle of combining large, medium, and small. The so-called "large" is to rely on the cadre schools of various ministries to train cadres in rotation, the so-called "medium" is the spare-time Red and Expert Universities or Red and Expert Schools currently established by some units, and the so-called "small" is the theoretical study groups voluntarily organized by the masses.

In order to consolidate the results of the rectification and implement the rectification spirit in future movements and all work, the Party Committee particularly emphasized that practical measures should be taken to strengthen the Party's leadership, fully promote socialist democracy, and resolutely implement the leadership method of the mass line. In the future, the leadership of all work must put politics in command, adhere to "务虚" (wu xu, focusing on ideology and principles), and use ideology to lead reality and politics to lead business. This point must be resolutely implemented. The meeting also proposed to universally promote the establishment of big-character poster societies.

    整风基本结束新的革命开始
　　中央国家机关准备从整风运动转向技术文化革命
    新华社14日讯　中央国家机关的整风运动到8月上旬为止，已有将近90％的司局单位结束了红专辩论，经历十五个月的具有历史意义的伟大整风运动，至此即将胜利结束。
    现在，许多结束红专辩论的单位，已经作完了个人思想总结，制订了个人红专规划，并且发动群众广泛地总结了整风运动的经验，通过这个总结，整风的丰富经验将被当作宝贵的财产继续发扬光大。
    各机关认真严肃地进行了整风复查和补课，特别是深入检查和处理了领导干部中遗留的问题
    为了把整风运动结束好，争取全胜，中央国家机关各单位曾经进行了认真严肃的整风复查和补课，特别是深入检查和处理了领导干部中遗留的问题。有些单位的领导干部由于对一些重大的政策方针存在着分歧，长期间在关系上不协调，有的发展成组织上的分散主义和严重的不团结现象；有些单位个别领导干部表现了严重的个人主义；有的在政治上犯有右倾机会主义的错误；有的甚至于发展到反党反领导的地步。这些问题都在整风补课中进行了充分的揭发和认真的批判。各单位在整风结束阶段坚决补好这一课，对于扫除今后大跃进道路上的障碍，加强党的团结，顺利贯彻党的总路线有着重要的意义。
    采用群众路线方法，发动全体干部进行整风总结，使这些经验深入人心，进而发挥更大作用
    全部整风运动的过程，实质上是一场无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想的大辩论、大斗争。中央国家机关同全国其他地方一样，经过十五个月轰轰烈烈的整风运动和反右派斗争，已取得了重大的收获和丰富的经验。最近，许多结束了整风的单位都举办了整风成果展览会。通过这些展览，生动地表明了人们思想解放的过程，表明了思想和工作大跃进的美丽图景。为了取得伟大整风运动的丰富经验，以便利用这些经验来开展技术革命和文化革命运动，很多单位采取了自上而下和自下而上相结合的群众路线的方法，发动全体干部来进行整风总结。第一机械工业部和水利电力部等单位都采取了这种总结方法，国务院秘书厅还发动了“百篇文章运动”，号召每人都写出整风的经验和体会。各单位在总结中，对于社会主义过渡时期两条道路斗争的长期性复杂性问题，对于政治挂帅问题，对于群众路线和采取群众运动的领导方法问题，以及大鸣大放大辩论大字报的社会主义民主新形式的运用问题，以“虚”带“实”、以红带专不断解放思想的重大意义等等问题，都有深刻的体会。由于采取群众运动的方式来总结整风，这就不仅可以使经验丰富起来，有助于把来自群众和实践中的经验上升为理论；而且更可以使群众自觉地掌握这些经验，使这些经验深入人心，进而发挥更伟大的作用。
    把整风运动结束好，把技术革命、文化革命开始好。整风运动结束，标志着一个新的革命运动开始
    整风运动的结束，标志着另一个新的革命运动的开始。中央国家机关党委在11日召开了各个整风领导小组组长会议，着重讨论了如何胜利地结束整风和整风运动结束后进行技术革命和文化革命问题。
    国务院秘书长习仲勋在这次会上讲了话，他说，现在这个时候非常重要，必须要把整风运动胜利结束好，把贯彻总路线、开展技术革命、文化革命的任务开始好，两个任务不同，但是运动不停，必须很好衔接起来，运动的中间当然有间歇时间，这就是总结经验，紧接间歇之后便是大跃进，而不是原地踏步。
    如何把整风运动结束好，习仲勋说，首先要把整风运动切实地坚持到底，有些单位整风还没有结束，必须坚持到底；已经结束了的单位，如果发现有不足的地方，仍然可以挤出一些时间来补一补课。另外，领导干部的整风补课很要紧，过去解决这些问题的火候还不到，有些问题在过去还不明显，现在运动已经到了一定的温度，应该下决心，大胆地把问题摊出来。这样，有些几年解决不了的老问题都可以很快解决。有些问题不要看成是小问题，不解决就会发展成为严重的问题。总之，领导干部的问题如果解决不透，就是整风运动的“夹生饭”，以后跃进就有困难。
    要把整风运动结束好，各机关还必须认真地总结整风运动的经验，这个总结也是马克思列宁主义哲学学习的开始，不要忽视这一工作。不善于总结经验就是经验主义的表现，过去我们就是常常犯这个毛病。整风的总结要形成群众运动，只有采取群众路线的方法才能更好地把丰富的经验总结起来。
    充分认识思想改造的长期性、艰巨性。应该经常敲起警钟，防止麻痹和自满
    习仲勋在讲话中还再一次强调了思想改造的长期性、艰巨性。他说，整风第四阶段是个人的思想革命，是对自己的重新认识，绝不能把第四阶段的成绩估计过高。如果认为经过这次红专辩论就已经插上了红旗，而且认为今后红旗可以不倒，那是右倾的看法。现在只是认识的开始，思想改造还是长期的、艰巨的。在中央国家机关，有些老干部因为放松了对自己思想的改造，结果犯了大错误而被开除了党籍，这是严重的教训。因此，思想改造一定也要不断革命，许多人不懂得这个道理，应该经常给他敲起警钟。特别是整风过去以后，或者是在大跃进中取得了一些成绩的时候，尤其要防止麻痹和自满。
    习仲勋说，所谓“开始好”也就是“衔接好”，要充分运用一年多的整风经验来开展技术革命和文化革命运动，要使总路线深入人心，使干部人人都懂得总路线的精神实质，把人们的精神进一步动员起来，造成轰轰烈烈的局面，掀起大跃进的高潮。
    开展技术革命、文化革命运动，目标要明确，措施要具体，而不要空喊。各机关都要提出明确的要求，并且纳入总的计划；同时要着重抓措施，抓先进，以先进带落后。
    关于理论学习，习仲勋说，目前应该着重抓住总路线和正确处理人民内部矛盾的学习。我们要学习毛主席的思想，提高马克思列宁主义水平，不断地解放我们自己的思想，推动机关工作的大跃进，这是技术革命、文化革命运动中的一项重要任务。学习要有两个结合，这就是要同本单位的工作实际和思想实际结合。他提出，学习方法同样可以采取大鸣大放大辩论的方法，例如对总路线有什么看法，可以鸣放几天，然后展开大辩论，最后发动大家进行总结。这样做，每个人是学生，也是先生，因为鸣放出来的东西就是很好的教材，是很丰富的实际，也是马列主义之“矢”所要射的“的”。因此，采取这种群众路线的方法进行学习，就可以更好地使理论联系实际。同时，将来学习哲学也同样可以采取这种鸣放辩论的方法。
    下一步的任务是认真贯彻总路线，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，促进机关工作的全面大跃进。在这方面仍然必须进行艰巨的思想斗争和政治斗争
    对于整风运动结束以后党的工作问题，中央国家机关党委根据先进单位的作法，提出了一些初步意见。党委会认为，在整风胜利的基础上，如何更好地开始下一个运动，是一个十分迫切的问题。在中央国家机关，下一步的任务应该是认真贯彻社会主义建设总路线，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，促进机关工作的全面大跃进。
    首先，应认真贯彻“不断革命”的思想。党委认为，不断革命的思想并没有完全为干部甚至某些领导干部所了解，例如新的任务提出后，有的机关就出现了“例外论”和“条件论”等错误思想，他们认为技术革命和文化革命只是技术、文化部门的事情，非技术、文化部门就无法进行，他们不了解所有机关和所有干部都应该无例外的动员起来积极参加这个运动。非技术、文化部门革命运动的方向应该是与一切保守思想作斗争，坚决贯彻总路线；也就是说，每一个机关，每一个工作人员动员起来，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地使本行业务工作进入一个大跃进的新局面，这样也就参加了全面的技术革命文化革命的行列。情况表明，贯彻总路线，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，促进机关工作的全面大跃进，仍然必须进行艰巨的思想斗争和政治斗争，这个斗争不仅包含着先进与保守的两种思想的斗争，甚至也包含着两条道路的斗争。
    贯彻总路线开展技术革命、文化革命运动，同整风运动一样，也是一个全民性的群众运动，同样的要目标明确、任务具体、口号响亮、方法对头，也要有安排、有步骤、有节奏、有进度。有了明确的方向和具体任务，还必须有好的方法。党委会认为，举办展览会，开现场会议，以及“五献”（即元旦、三八、五一、七一、十一向党献礼）“四比”（即比政治、比干劲、比风格、比贡献）的作法，都是有效的方法。
    掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮，学习也可以同样运用大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的方法
    关于如何掀起一个学习毛主席著作的热潮问题，会上提到，今后中央国家机关将以一年左右的时间大体分作三个单元专门学习毛主席著作和党的总路线。这三个单元是，社会主义建设时期的总路线问题，两类不同性质的矛盾问题，哲学（“实践论”、“矛盾论”为主要文件）。党委要求，学习必须贯彻理论联系实际的精神，整风运动中的大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的方法，可以同样运用到理论学习中去。学习的组织形式可以采取大中小相结合的方针。所谓“大”就是依靠各部的干部学校来轮训干部，所谓“中”就是目前有些单位所创办的业余性的红专大学或红专学校，所谓“小”就是群众自愿组织起来的理论学习小组。
    为了巩固整风成果，把整风精神贯彻到今后的运动和一切工作中去，党委会特别强调要采取切实措施来加强党的领导，充分发扬社会主义民主，坚决贯彻群众路线的领导方法。今后一切工作的领导都要政治挂帅，坚持“务虚”，以虚带实，以政治带业务，这一点必须坚决贯彻。会上还提出要普遍推广办大字报社。
