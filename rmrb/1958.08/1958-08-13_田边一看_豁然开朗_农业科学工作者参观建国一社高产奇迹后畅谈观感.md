Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 12th: A group of agricultural scientists who personally visited the Jian’guo First Cooperative in Macheng County, Hubei Province, shared their impressions at the invitation of Xinhua News Agency reporters. They unanimously agreed that the record of 36,956 jin per mu of early rice created jointly by the cadres and masses of the Jian’guo First Cooperative was a remarkable miracle. This miracle is the result of the implementation of the general line of socialist construction among the masses.

Zhang Ziming, Director of the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, said: "As long as you take a look at the field, all doubts will be resolved. That field is simply different. The rice ears that have matured but not yet been harvested are laid flat on the ground, more than a foot thick. Normally, one inch thick is considered a high-yielding field. At the same time, the ears of rice in this field are very dense, overlapping each other, and the height of the distribution space reaches more than 50 centimeters. The ear length is generally 25 centimeters, and the size of almost every ear is about the same. In the past, many of our agronomists could not figure out: If one mu of land produces more than 10,000 jin of grain, how should the ears of rice be arranged, and how should the seedlings grow? Now, seeing it, these questions are answered. They can fight for survival space! But it is difficult to imagine if you don't see it with your own eyes."

Guo Fu, Deputy Director of the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, said: "Wang Qiancheng, the director of the cooperative and one of the main cultivators of high yield, said to us when introducing the situation, 'We are only afraid that we can't think of it; if we think of it, we can do it.' This remark has greatly inspired me. Many of our agricultural scientists lack this spirit. They don't do it as soon as they think of it, but have many concerns." Zhang Qishan, Deputy Director of the Jiangxi Agricultural Science Research Institute, said: "The minds of many of our agronomists have not been liberated. When talking about close planting, he said that each mu cannot exceed 100,000 seedlings, and when talking about deep plowing, he said that it cannot exceed six inches, etc. They cannot break through conventions and dare not boldly conceive. However, the Jian'guo First Cooperative deep-plowed more than one chi deep and planted as densely as 800,000 seedlings, achieving a high yield of nearly 37,000 jin. In comparison, we are far behind the masses." Wang Xingwu, Deputy Director of the Hunan Agricultural Science Research Institute, and Zhao Hengchun, technician of the Agricultural Experiment Farm of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, both praised the method of using seedling transplanting to ensure dense planting in this field, believing that it was an important method for cultivating high yields.

These agricultural scientists also repeatedly said that putting politics in command and the leadership and support of the Party committee were important reasons for the high yield of this field. Zhang Ziming said: "If politics had not been put in command, and if the Party committee had not continuously strengthened political work, then it would have been unimaginable to take resolute measures to transplant seedlings a month after planting. They did this because they believed in the Party's call and could consciously turn the Party's call into action."

In order to provide more agricultural scientists with such learning opportunities, Wang Xingwu and Zhang Qishan have sent telegrams overnight to Hunan and Jiangxi, asking the Hunan and Jiangxi Agricultural Science Research Institutes to immediately organize staff within the institute to come and visit. All staff members of the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute and its affiliated Agricultural Experiment Farm have decided to go to visit in batches within two days. Zhang Ziming said: "Our research work is far behind the masses, but we should catch up. Through this visit, our thinking has been liberated, and our confidence in catching up has been enhanced. But to catch up, we must first learn from the masses and boldly create on the basis of learning."

    田边一看　豁然开朗
　　农业科学工作者参观建国一社高产奇迹后畅谈观感
    据新华社武汉12日电　一批亲到现场参观了湖北省麻城县建国第一社的农业科学工作者，应新华社记者的邀请畅谈了他们的观感。他们一致认为建国第一社的干部和群众共同创造的早稻亩产三万六千九百五十六斤的纪录是了不起的奇迹。这个奇迹是社会主义建设总路线在群众中得到贯彻的成果。
    华中农业科学研究所所长张子明说：“只要到田边一看，一切疑虑就都解决了。那块田就是与众不同，那些成熟后尚未收割的谷穗，平铺在地上足有一尺多厚，而通常情况是厚一寸左右就算丰产田了。同时这块田的谷穗长得很密，上下交错地靠在一起，分布空间的高度达五十公分以上，穗长一般达二十五公分，几乎每个穗的大小都差不多。过去我们有许多农学家总是想不通：一亩田产万多斤谷，谷穗该怎么摆，禾苗该怎样长呢？现在一看这些问题得到解答了，它们可以向空间争取生存地位啊！可是要是不亲眼看到那是很难想像的”。
    华中农业科学研究所副所长郭甫说：“丰产的主要培育人之一的社主任王乾成向我们介绍情况时说：“我们就是怕想不到，想到了的就能做到”，这话对我的启发很大，而我们许多农业科学工作者正缺乏这种精神，不是想到就做到，而是顾虑重重”。江西农业科学研究所副所长张岐山说：“我们还有许多农学家的思想没有解放，一谈密植他就说每亩不能超过十万蔸，一谈深耕他就说不能超过六寸等等，他们突不破陈规，不敢大胆设想，可是建国第一社深耕一尺多，密植达八十万蔸以上，获得了将近三万七千斤的高产。比较起来，我们是远远地落在群众后面了”。湖南农业科学研究所副所长王星五和华东农业科学研究所农业试验场技术员赵恒春都对这块田用掇秧的办法来保证密植的作法很称赞，认为那是培育高产的一个重要方法。
    这些农业科学工作者还一再地说政治挂帅党委的领导和支持是这块田高产的重要原因。张子明说：“要不是政治挂了帅，要不是党委不断地加强了政治工作，那么当秧插下一个月后，还采取坚决措施掇秧，是不可想像的，他们要这样做是因为他们相信党的号召能自觉地把党的号召变成行动”。
    为了使更多的农业科学工作者得到这样的学习机会，王星五和张歧山都已连夜向湖南、江西发出电报要湖南、江西农业科学研究所立即组织所内工作人员前来参观。华中农业科学研究所和它所属的农业试验场的全体工作人员已决定在两天内分批前往参观。张子明说：“我们的研究工作和群众比起来是落后很远了，但我们应该赶上去。通过这次参观，我们的思想解放了，赶上去的信心增强了，但是要赶上去就得首先向群众学习并在学习的基础上大胆地独创”。
