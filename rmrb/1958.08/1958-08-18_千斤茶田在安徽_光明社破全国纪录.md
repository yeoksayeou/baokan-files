　　千斤茶田在安徽
　　光明社破全国纪录
    据新华社合肥17日电　皖南山区放出茶叶亩产一千一百七十六斤的“卫星”，这比福建省前轮二社春夏两季亩产茶叶九百零五斤的全国纪录还高二百七十一斤。这颗茶叶卫星是在歙县街口乡光明茶业社发射出来的。卫星茶园的面积为一亩一分八厘，春夏两季共采干茶一千三百八十八斤，折合亩产干茶一千一百七十六斤。而且这亩茶园所产大都是细茶，其中一、二级茶要占86％。预计这块茶园还可采摘秋茶三百斤，三季亩产可达一千四百三十斤。
    这块丰产茶园是光明社党支书汪兆昌、社副主任张兰香、八队队长胡日和培养的，并且有党、团员和社员参加管理和采制茶叶。去冬今春，他们在这块茶园里深耕、锄草各三次，施下人粪二百担，猪粪五十五担，化肥一百斤，烂泥一千九百担，卤水一百二十担，并进行了防冻、防治病虫害等工作。
