Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th - Chairman Mao inspected Xushui, Anguo, and Ding County in Hebei Province in early August. Xie Xuegong, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Minghe, Deputy Governor of Hebei Province, accompanied Chairman Mao on the inspection.

In the Dasi Gezhuang Agricultural Cooperative of Nanliyuan Township, Xushui County, Chairman Mao inspected the cooperative's grain processing plant, supply and marketing cooperative, hospital, pig farm, and sewing factory. He then visited the cooperative's kindergarten and the "Happiness Home," which provides for the elderly who have lost their ability to work, accompanied by cooperative cadres. In the "Happiness Home," Chairman Mao warmly shook hands and greeted the elderly. Chairman Mao also inspected the cooperative's canteen and visited the fields to observe the growth of crops. Back in the county, Chairman Mao also visited the county-run bacterial fertilizer factory and iron factory. Chairman Mao expressed his satisfaction with the enthusiasm of the people of Xushui County. Zhang Guozhong, First Secretary of the Xushui County Party Committee, reported to Chairman Mao that Xushui County would harvest 1.1 billion jin of grain in the autumn. Chairman Mao was very happy and asked Zhang Guozhong, "Your county has a population of over 310,000 people, how can you eat so much grain? What will you do with so much grain?" Zhang Guozhong said that he had not considered this issue, and replied, "We are just thinking about how to produce more grain!" Chairman Mao instructed that the problem of what to do with so much grain should also be considered. Chairman Mao also instructed the Xushui County Party Committee to seize early on next year's grain plan, to plant more wheat and more oil crops, and to plant more varieties of vegetables, in order to meet the needs of the people.

In the rural areas of Ding County and Anguo County, Chairman Mao inspected the growth of crops and expressed his happiness at the achievements of the agricultural cooperative members in the Great Leap Forward in production. In the high-yield fields of the Liucun Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Anguo County, Chairman Mao warmly shook hands with Wang Changsuo, the Party Branch Secretary of the agricultural cooperative who was working there. Chairman Mao also went to a sorghum field to observe the growth of sorghum and shook hands and talked with the cooperative members who had gathered around. The cooperative members shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Long live the Communist Party" to Chairman Mao. During his inspection in Xushui, Anguo, and other places, Chairman Mao inquired caringly about the lives and production of the local people and had cordial conversations with the masses.

Chairman Mao's inspection in Xushui and other places and his concern for the masses greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses. The Xushui County Party Committee held a county-wide telephone conference that night, and every township and cooperative pledged to the Party and Chairman Mao in the telephone conference that they would achieve a great harvest in grain and all other fronts of industry this year. After two days and one night of hard work, more than 110,000 farmers in the county accumulated more than 314,600 carts of fertilizer, top-dressed more than 66,600 mu of autumn crops, and weeded more than 80,000 mu. The Ding County Party Committee also held an emergency meeting of more than 300 responsible cadres on the night of Chairman Mao's departure. Within two days, in addition to vigorously accumulating and applying fertilizer, the county also built 2,320 new chemical fertilizer plants. Anguo County decided to strive to reach a grain yield of 4,500 jin per mu this year. In order to ensure the realization of the plan to produce 2,000 jin of wheat per mu next year, it was decided to apply 150,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Every township and cooperative in the county held a Great Leap Forward meeting, forming a new upsurge in production. (Attached pictures)

　　要大家考虑粮食大增产后的新问题
　　早抓明年规划多种小麦和油料作物
    新华社天津10日电　毛主席在8月上旬视察了河北省徐水、安国和定县。中共河北省委书记处书记解学恭、河北省副省长张明河等随同毛主席进行视察。
    毛主席在徐水县南梨园乡大寺各庄农业社视察了农业社的粮食加工厂和供销部、医院、猪场、缝纫工厂，接着又在社干部的陪同下参观了这个农业社的幼儿园和供养失去劳动力的老年人的“幸福院”。在“幸福院”里，毛主席同老人们亲切地握手致意。毛主席还视察了这个农业社的食堂，并且到田间视察了农作物的生长情况。回到县里，毛主席又看了县办的细菌肥料厂和铁工厂。毛主席对徐水县人民的干劲表示满意。中共徐水县委第一书记张国忠向毛主席汇报说，徐水县秋季要收十一亿斤粮食。毛主席听了很高兴，问张国忠说：“你们全县三十一万多人口，怎么吃得完那么多粮食？粮食多了怎么办？”张国忠表示还没有考虑到这个问题，他说，“我们只是光在考虑怎么多打粮食哩！”毛主席指示说，还应该考虑到生产了这么多粮食怎么办的问题。毛主席又指示徐水县委要早抓明年的粮食规划，要多种小麦、多种油料作物，种菜也要多品种，这样来满足人民的需要。
    毛主席在定县和安国县的农村视察了农作物的生长情况，对农业社社员们生产大跃进的成就表示高兴。在安国县流村红星农业社的丰产田里，毛主席和正在那里劳动的农业社党支部书记王长锁亲切握手。毛主席还到一块高粱地里观看了高粱的生长情况，并且和围拢上来的社员们握手谈话。社员们向毛主席高呼“毛主席万岁”“共产党万岁”。在徐水、安国等地视察的时候，毛主席都关切地询问了当地人民的生活和生产情况，并且同群众作了亲切的交谈。
    毛主席在徐水等地的视察和对群众的关怀，大大鼓舞了广大干部和群众的干劲。徐水县委在当天夜里召开了全县的电话会议，乡乡社社都在电话会议上向党和毛主席保证一定要使今年的粮食和工业等各个战线上都获得大丰收。全县十一万多名农民经过两天一夜的苦战，就积肥三十一万四千六百多车，大秋作物追肥六万六千六百多亩，除草八万多亩。中共定县县委在毛主席离开的当天晚上也召开了三百多负责干部参加的紧急会议，全县在两天时间内除大搞积肥追肥外，并新建起化肥厂两千三百二十座。安国县决定今年全县粮食产量力争达到亩产四千五百斤，为保证实现明年亩产小麦二千斤的计划，决定每亩施底肥十五万斤，全县乡乡社社都召开了跃进大会，形成了一个新的生产高潮。（附图片）
