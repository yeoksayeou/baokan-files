　　Establish Iron Will, Grow Leaping Courage
    More Than Four Thousand Demobilized Soldiers in Gaoping Self-Manage Factories
    (Our dispatch) "Establish iron will, grow leaping courage, plant red flags in our minds, eliminate feelings of inferiority, practice diligence and frugality well, invest like heroes, and be an unbreakable, indestructible, and unfading revolutionary!" This is the heroic battle cry of more than four thousand six hundred demobilized soldiers in Gaoping County, Shanxi Province. Encouraged by this battle cry, they have invested 400,000 yuan and are building an "August 1st" Steel Plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel by themselves. At present, this steel plant is taking shape. Before "August 1st" (Army Day), the first furnace of dazzling red molten iron flowed out. By National Day this year, the plant plans to produce 80 tons of steel per day.
    The construction of the "August 1st" Factory was first proposed by Li Guoyou and 17 other demobilized soldiers. As soon as the proposal was issued, it was met with a response from many demobilized soldiers. They voluntarily signed up to invest and put forward more advanced plans. The original plan was to build a steel plant with an annual output of only 15,000 tons of steel; after revision, the scale of the factory was expanded, with a planned annual output of 100,000 tons of steel. In addition, a coal mine with an annual output of 600,000 tons and a transportation company with 15 vehicles were added. In order to invest in the construction of the factory, demobilized soldier Bai Peijin took out all the money he had prepared for his wedding. He said: "Of the three important things at home, choose the most urgent one first. The wedding can be postponed, but the construction of the factory cannot be delayed!"
    At present, the factory buildings of the "August 1st" Coal Mine have also been completed and wells are being dug. Coal will be produced this year. The three vehicles and a large number of rubber-tired carts of the "August 1st" Transportation Company are also running day and night in various places, undertaking busy transportation tasks.

### 立下钢铁志  长上跃进胆  高平四千多复员军人自办工厂

　　立下钢铁志  长上跃进胆
    高平四千多复员军人自办工厂
    本报讯  “立下钢铁志，长上跃进胆，思想插红旗，打掉自卑感，勤俭节约好，投资比好汉，当一个打不碎，砸不烂，永不褪色的革命派！”这是山西省高平县四千六百多名复员军人的豪迈战斗口号。在这一战斗口号的鼓舞下，他们已投资四十万元，并且自己动手修建一座年产十万吨钢铁的“八一”钢铁厂。目前，这一钢铁厂已初具规模，“八一”前夕，已流出了第一炉红光耀眼的铁水。到今年国庆节前夕，这个厂计划每天生产钢铁八十吨。
    兴建“八一”工厂，首先是李国有等十七名复员军人倡议的。倡议刚发出，就获得了许多复员军人的响应。他们自动报名投资，而且提出了更先进的计划。原计划修建的钢铁厂，年产钢铁仅为一万五千吨；经过修改后，工厂的规模扩大了，计划年产钢铁十万吨。另外，还增添了一个年产六十万吨的煤矿，和一个拥有十五辆汽车的运输公司。为了投资兴建工厂，复员军人白培金把自己准备结婚的费用都拿了出来。他说：“家有三件事，先拣紧的做。结婚可以推迟，建厂可不能延后！”
    目前，“八一”煤矿的厂房也已落成，正在打井，今年就能出煤。“八一”运输公司的三辆汽车和大批胶轮大车，也夜以继日地奔驰在各地，担负着繁忙的运输任务。
