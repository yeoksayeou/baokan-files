Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 30th -- The evening paper "Leader" published an editorial on the 30th, saying that the Baghdad Pact Council meeting without Iraq's participation "seemed like a gathering of five countries there for a meeting to deliver funeral eulogies for the unfortunate Baghdad Pact."

The editorial also said, "The result of Pakistan and the other two Muslim countries participating in the meeting is to make these countries stand out quite prominently from the other countries of the Muslim world and isolate themselves."

The editorial said, "The people of Pakistan have the right to question the government, is it realizing the wishes of eighty million people?"

The editorial pointed out, "American and British strategists attempted to safeguard their oil interests by splitting the Arab world through the Baghdad Pact, but the rising tide of Arab nationalism undermined their plan, and today the Muslim world is once again closer to the goal of unity."

The editorial said, "The regional alliances initiated by the United States and Britain run counter to the idea of Muslim unity because their vested interests conflict with the movements for independence within these countries."

The editorial also said, "As long as Pakistan is a member of a regional military alliance initiated by Western countries, Arabs, Indonesians, and other Muslims will view it with suspicion."

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 31st -- "Karachi Times" today, in commenting on the London meeting of the "Baghdad Pact" Council, expressed opposition to the plot of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to make Pakistan oppose its own "Arab Muslim brothers." The newspaper said, "The moment has come to part ways with the West."

The newspaper attacked Dulles's assurance at the London meeting regarding increasing "aid" to the Baghdad Pact signatory countries. The newspaper said that America's guarantee "is worthless in Pakistan's eyes."

The newspaper said that the "best course of action" for Pakistan is to "withdraw from the treaty immediately. It is certainly not a practically effective policy if we take on heavy burdens for a purpose that we have no reason to agree with."

"Pakistan Times" pointed out in an editorial that the London meeting communique of the "Baghdad Pact" Council "mentions the Middle East, where no Arab country participates in the Baghdad Pact, and it (the Baghdad Pact Group) says that it has the right to defend that region, which is obviously futile. Similarly, the claim that the Baghdad Pact is a regional defense alliance established under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter is even more untenable."

An editorial published by "Today's News" in Lahore, commenting on the U.S.'s proposal to sign "defense" agreements separately with Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey, said that the purpose of these treaties is to prepare conditions for establishing a "defense" organization with leadership directly manipulated by the United States after the (Baghdad Pact) dies.

The newspaper said, "The main question is: why should we continue to be entangled with these treaties, because the future of these treaties is bleak and we have never gained any benefit from them."

Xinhua News Agency, 1st -- New York dispatch: "Wall Street Journal" expressed sorrow over the serious failure suffered by the Baghdad Pact Group.

The newspaper acknowledged in an article in the "Comments and Prospects" column on July 29 that "the Baghdad Pact has always been an abnormal organization," and since the Iraqi revolution, "this organization has indeed become a very strange alliance."

The article admitted that the treaty "obviously did not achieve" the goal of suppressing the Arab national liberation movement in the Middle East. The article said, "Ironically, the treaty has an anti-subversion committee," but Iraq still experienced a revolution that overthrew the pro-imperialist Faisal dynasty, so the treaty proved completely unable to prevent this "subversion." The article also mentioned that the United States previously provided military assistance to the Iraqi Faisal dynasty, but the Iraqi people "used American weapons to drive out the American-backed government."

The article expressed doubt about the continued existence of the treaty's significance. The article admitted that the treaty's nefarious purposes have proven to be "unachievable," and it argued that America's future Middle East policy should "have a realistic foundation."

    卡拉奇报纸认为巴格达条约已死去
    巴基斯坦应同西方分道扬镳
    “华尔街日报”对巴格达条约集团严重失败表示悲哀
    新华社卡拉奇30日电　晚报“领袖报”30日发表社论说，没有伊拉克参加的巴格达条约理事会会议“好像是五个国家集合在那里为不幸的巴格达条约发表葬礼演说的一次会议”。
    社论又说，“巴基斯坦和其他两个穆斯林国家参加会议的结果，使这几个国家颇为突出地脱离了穆斯林世界的其他国家而孤立起来”。
    社论说，“巴基斯坦人民有权利质问政府，它是不是在实现八千万人民的愿望？”
    社论指出，“美英战略家们企图通过巴格达条约用分裂阿拉伯世界的办法来维护他们的石油利益，但是高涨的阿拉伯民族主义浪潮破坏了他们的计划，今天穆斯林世界又一次靠近了团结的目标”。
    社论说，“美国和英国所发起的区域性联盟是同穆斯林团结的思想背道而驰的，因为它们的切身利益是同这些国家内的要求独立的运动相冲突的”。
    社论又说，“只要巴基斯坦是西方国家所发起的区域性军事联盟的一个成员，阿拉伯人、印度尼西亚人和其他穆斯林就会以怀疑的眼光来看它。”
    新华社卡拉奇31日电　“卡拉奇时报”今天在评论“巴格达条约”理事会伦敦会议时，表示反对美国国务卿杜勒斯企图使巴基斯坦反对它自己的“阿拉伯穆斯林兄弟”的阴谋。这家报纸说，“同西方分道扬镳的时刻已经来到了。”
    这家报纸抨击杜勒斯在伦敦会议上所提出的关于增加对巴格达条约缔约国的“援助”的保证。报纸说，美国的保证“在巴基斯坦看来是一钱不值的”。
    这家报纸说，巴基斯坦应当采取的“最好的方针就是立即退出条约。如果我们为了一种我们没有理由同意的目的而去担起重担的话，那当然不是一种切实有效的政策。”
    “巴基斯坦时报”在社论中指出，“巴格达条约”理事会伦敦会议的公报“所提到的地区是中东，在那里没有一个阿拉伯国家参加巴格达条约，而它（巴格达条约集团）却说，它有权保卫那个地区，这显然是徒劳无益的。同样，所谓巴格达条约是根据联合国宪章第五十一条而建立起来的区域性的防御联盟的说法更难站得住脚。”
    拉合尔的“今天报”发表的社论在评论美国准备同巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其分别签订“防御”协定的主张时说，这些条约的目的就是要在（巴格达条约）死亡以后为建立一个领导权直接操纵在美国手里的“防御”组织准备条件。
    这家报纸说，“主要问题是：为什么我们还要继续同这些条约勾搭起来，因为这些条约的前途是漆黑一团，而且我们从中没有取得过任何好处。”
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：“华尔街日报”对于巴格达条约集团遭到的严重失败表示悲哀。
    这家报纸7月29日在“评论和展望”专栏发表的一篇文章承认，“巴格达条约一向是一个反常的组织”，而自从伊拉克革命以来，“这个组织确实成为一个非常奇怪的联盟了”。
    这篇文章承认这个条约“显然没有达到”镇压中东阿拉伯民族解放运动的目的。文章说，“说起来也是富有讽刺意味的是，这个条约有一个反颠覆委员会”，但是伊拉克还是发生了推翻效忠于帝国主义的费萨尔王朝的革命，因此这个条约证明完全不能防止这种“颠覆”。这篇文章还提到，过去美国向伊拉克费萨尔王朝提供军事援助，但是伊拉克人民“却利用美国武器赶走了美国支持的政府”。
    这篇文章对于这个条约继续存在的意义表示怀疑。文章承认，事实证明这个条约的罪恶目的是“不可实现的”，它主张美国将来的中东政策应该“有一个现实的基础”。
