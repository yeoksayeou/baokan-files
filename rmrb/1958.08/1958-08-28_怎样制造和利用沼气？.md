　　How to Make and Utilize Biogas?
    Many places have encountered some problems in the process of producing biogas.
    At the request of our readers, we have asked comrades from Zhejiang Agricultural College to introduce their experience in biogas production for reference in various regions. Please continue to raise any new issues for discussion.
                          Editor
    How to Mix Ingredients
    Based on the rural conditions and characteristics of Zhejiang Province, we selected ten types of raw materials: human manure, pig manure, cow manure, horse manure, rice straw, wheat straw, green grass, bamboo leaves, garbage, and river mud. There were a total of forty-five different types of combinations. The experimental results showed that biogas fermentation could proceed regardless of how the various raw materials were mixed. However, the biogas production varied.
    If pig manure is the main ingredient in your region, we suggest using pig manure (four parts) and rice straw (one part). This combination was the best in our experiments. If horse manure is the main ingredient, we suggest using horse manure (three parts) and rice straw (one part). If human manure is the main ingredient, we suggest using human manure (four parts) and garbage (one part). Since the composition of livestock manure varies depending on the type of feed, the digestion of livestock, and other factors, the above experimental results are for reference only.
    Biogas fermentation generally reaches its peak gas production ten to fifty days after feeding, then gradually decreases. Biogas is still produced after one hundred and twenty days, but the yield is minimal. Therefore, biogas fermentation must be fed after fifty days, otherwise it will affect gas production.
    Different fermentation conditions also affect biogas fermentation. Regarding moisture content, fermentation is best and gas production is highest when the moisture content in the mixture is 88-92%. Organic acids are produced during biogas fermentation, so a neutralizing agent must be added. Generally, adding 1% CaCO3 is more appropriate. If the raw material contains a large amount of human manure, it may not be necessary to add it.
    Fertilizer Efficiency Test After Fermentation
    The same fertilizer was used, one portion for biogas fermentation and one portion for traditional farm composting. After a certain period, the nutrient content was measured separately and rice fertilizer efficiency tests were conducted. The results are as follows:
    (1) After biogas fermentation, the total nitrogen content of various organic fertilizers is almost not lost, or only a very small amount is lost. If the reaction of the fermentation liquid is adjusted to not exceed PH7.4, after one month of fermentation, the total nitrogen content can reach 90-99% of the total nitrogen content before fermentation, and the available nitrogen (referring to ammonia nitrogen) can increase by an average of two to four times. If the same fertilizer is piled up in a general farm for one month, the total nitrogen content is only 65-85% of the total nitrogen content before fermentation. An average of 20-35% is lost during the piling process, and the available nitrogen is lost by an average of 20-70%. Therefore, organic fertilizers that have undergone biogas fermentation have higher total nitrogen and available nitrogen than those that have been treated with general piling.
    (2) If a small amount of phosphate fertilizer is mixed before fermentation, it can not only promote the decomposition of cellulose in the fertilizer and increase biogas production, but also accelerate the decomposition of nitrogen-containing compounds in the fertilizer and increase the rapid-acting nitrogen fertilizer. If 2% superphosphate is mixed in the mixture, after one month of fermentation, the rapid-acting nitrogen is 49.1% higher than that of the mixture without phosphate fertilizer, thus improving the quality of the fertilizer.
    (3) According to pot experiments, fertilizers that have undergone biogas fermentation have higher fertilizer efficiency than general farm composting. Applying it to early rice can promote plant growth, and the leaves are greener with a higher chlorophyll content. Effect on Pathogens in Manure
    According to experimental results, schistosomiasis eggs in manure all die within thirteen days after biogas fermentation, hookworm eggs all die within twenty-three days, roundworm eggs die within eighteen days, and lung fluke eggs die within eight days. Although sheep fluke eggs and E. coli did not all die within twenty-eight days of biogas fermentation, the mortality rate was extremely high. 97.34% of sheep fluke eggs died after twenty-eight days, and the number of E. coli decreased significantly after eighteen days of biogas fermentation.
    From the above experimental results, it can be affirmed that manure can be basically harmless after biogas fermentation.
    Fermentation Tank Architectural Design
    Fermentation tanks were built with stone, wood, brick and cement. Due to the different ways of biogas utilization, two types, medium and small, were built with various structural forms. Stone and wood are the most economical building materials and can be vigorously promoted in rural areas. According to more than five months of testing, solving the air leakage problem of the fermentation tank is the most important. The solution to the air leakage problem is to plaster the top wall inside the tank. We tested two types of plastering combinations, and the results were very good. For the first, second, and third plastering, use 1:1:2 cement fine sand paper reinforcement lime. For the fourth and fifth plastering, use 2:1:0.5 cement fine sand lime slurry. Plastering five times in total, with each plastering thickness of six to nine millimeters. The fermentation tank can meet the requirements of no air leakage after plastering.
    We also designed four types of stirrers: rotary, baffle, lift and float, and electric stirring. The rotary type has high resistance and is not very suitable. Although the lift and float stirrer is more labor-saving when stirring, the stirring surface is small and the effect is not high. The electric type is costly and not suitable for current rural use. Relatively speaking, the baffle type is more suitable.

### 怎样制造和利用沼气？

　　怎样制造和利用沼气？
    许多地方在制取沼气当中遇到了一些问题。
    我们应读者的要求，请浙江农学院的同志把他们试制沼气的经验介绍出来供各地参考。以后还有什么新问题也请继续提出来讨论。
                          编者
    怎样配料
    我们根据浙江省农村情况和特点，分别选定了十种原料：人粪、猪粪、牛粪、马粪、稻草、麦秸、青草、竹叶、垃圾和河泥。共有四十五种不同类型的组合，试验结果是：各种原料不问如何配合，都能进行沼气发酵。但沼气产生量有多有少。
    各地在配料时如以猪粪为主，建议采用猪粪（四份）、稻草（一份），这样配料是我们试验中最好的一种；如以马粪为主，建议采用马粪（三份）、稻草（一份）；如以人粪为主，建议采用人粪（四份）垃圾（一份）。由于家畜粪便成份是随着饲料的种类、家畜的消化情况等因素而不同，因此以上试验结果仅供参考。
    沼气发酵一般在进料后十天到五十天产气量最多，以后逐渐减少，到一百二十天以后还有沼气产生，但产量极微。因此沼气发酵在进料五十天后必须加料，否则影响出气量。
    发酵条件的不同，对于沼气发酵亦有影响。如以水分含量而论，配料中水分在88—92％时发酵最好，产气量亦高。沼气发酵时能产生有机酸，故须加中和剂。一般加1％CaCo3较为适当。如原料中含有较多量的人粪，则可不加。
    发酵后的肥效试验
    以同样肥料，一份进行沼气发酵；一份按农家堆肥。在一定时间后，分别测定其中养料含量并进行水稻肥效试验，所得结果如下：
    （一）各种有机肥料在沼气发酵后，全氮量几乎没有损失，或极少量损失。如调节发酵液的反应不超过PH7.4，发酵一个月后，全氮量可达未发酵前全氮量的90—99％，有效氮（指氨态氮）平均可增加二至四倍。如果把同样肥料按照一般农家堆积一个月，全氮量仅为发酵前全氮量的65—85％，在堆积过程中平均要损失20—35％，而有效氮平均要损失20—70％。因此有机肥料经沼气发酵，不问全氮量和有效氮均较一般堆积处理的高。
    （二）发酵前如混合少量磷肥，不仅可促进肥料中纤维素的分解，增加沼气产量；而且还能加速肥料中含氮化合物的分解，增加速效氮肥。如配料中混合2％过磷酸钙，发酵后一个月，其中速效氮较未混合磷肥的平均要增加49.1％，因而提高了肥料品质。
    （三）根据盆栽试验，凡经沼气发酵的肥料，肥效较一般农家堆积的高。施于早稻，能促进植物生长，且叶色较绿，叶绿素含量较多。对于粪便中病原体的作用
    根据试验结果，粪便经沼气发酵后，血吸虫卵在十三天内全部死亡，钩虫卵在二十三天内全部死亡，蛔虫卵在十八天内死亡，肺吸虫卵在八天内死亡。羌片虫卵和大肠杆菌在沼气发酵二十八天内，虽未全部死亡，但死亡率极高。羌片虫卵经二十八天后已有97.34％死亡，大肠杆菌经沼气发酵十八天后数量显著减少。
    从以上试验结果可以肯定地指出，粪便经沼气发酵后可以基本达到无害化。
    发酵池建筑设计
    发酵池分别采用石头、木材、砖和水泥试建。由于沼气利用方式不同，分别试建了中、小两种类型，采取各种结构形式。建筑材料以石头和木料的最为经济，可在农村中大力推广。根据五个多月来的试验，发酵池解决漏气问题最重要。解决漏气的办法是在池内顶壁加以抹灰。我们试验用的抹灰有两种配合，效果都很好。第一、二、三次各抹1∶1∶2的水泥细砂纸筋石灰，第四、五次各抹2∶1∶0.5的水泥细砂石灰浆，共抹灰五次，每次抹灰厚度为六到九公厘，发酵池经抹灰后可达到不漏气的要求。
    我们还设计了四种形式的搅拌器：旋转式、绕板式、升浮式和电动搅拌。旋转式阻力大，不太适用。升浮式搅拌器搅拌时虽然比较省力，但搅拌面小，效果不高。电动式成本大，不适合目前农村用。比较起来还是绕板式较为适用。
