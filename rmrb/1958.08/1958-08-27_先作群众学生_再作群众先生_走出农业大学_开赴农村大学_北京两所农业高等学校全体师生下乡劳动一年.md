　　First Be Students of the Masses, Then Be Teachers of the Masses
    Leaving Agricultural University, Heading to Rural University
    All Teachers and Students of Two Agricultural Universities in Beijing Go to the Countryside for a Year of Labor

    (Our Newspaper News) In order to resolutely implement the policy of education serving production and the combination of education and labor, all the more than three thousand teachers, cadres, and students of Beijing Agricultural University will go to the countryside for a year of labor. The first group of more than one hundred teachers and students departed for Shanxi on the 26th.

    The year-long stay in the countryside for all faculty and students of Beijing Agricultural University is to participate in basic-level production labor, transform their thinking through labor, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish and consolidate the working-class viewpoint, the mass viewpoint, the labor viewpoint, and the dialectical materialism viewpoint. At the same time, they will broadly understand the process of field crop and animal husbandry production in the areas they go to, as well as the political and economic aspects of the cooperatives, in order to lay the foundation for future reforms of teaching plans, teaching content, teaching methods, and scientific research work. Simultaneously, they will participate in high-yield experimental field work, deeply summarize the farmers' high-yield experiences, organize on-site teaching, take "those who are able" as teachers, invite model workers, cadres, and farmers to give reports to teachers and students, and conduct scientific research in conjunction with the major issues currently raised in agricultural production. They will also provide strong support to the countryside in various agricultural technologies and cultural education, such as imparting the production technology of antibiotic bacteria and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, assisting in the establishment of factories, imparting crop hybridization and breeding techniques, assisting in the establishment of agricultural middle schools, red-expert universities, and eliminating illiteracy, and so on. In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, they will be organized into mixed teams of various specialties. They will be dispatched to eight regions, including the suburbs of Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Ningxia. A small number of teachers and students will remain at the school to continue running factories and engage in production labor on the school farm.

    The faculty, students, and cadres of the Agricultural University launched a warm discussion on the decision of the Party Committee, believing that this is an important step in running agricultural schools well and implementing the combination of education and production, and a correct way to transform the thinking of teachers, students, and cadres, and accelerate the improvement of the Agricultural University. Many people expressed that they would put down their airs and humbly learn from the peasants, and demanded to go to the most difficult places to train themselves. The joint letter written by Wang Yuqi and 17 other people from the Department of Agricultural Economics stated: "Resolutely respond to the call of the Party, unconditionally obey the allocation, consciously transform our thinking, and achieve a four-fold harvest in ideology, labor, study, and physical exercise."

    In the rectification campaign and the Double-Anti movement, Beijing Agricultural University carried out teaching reforms on the basis of criticizing bourgeois educational thought, launched work-study programs, and seven majors and classes went to farms for on-site teaching. Teachers also planted high-yield experimental fields. In mid-July, after Comrade Kang Sheng inspected the work of the Agricultural University, all teachers and students launched a movement centered on accumulating fertilizer and strengthening field management, worked hard for two months, developed large-scale high-yield agricultural land, and vigorously developed industry. Within a week, they used the original equipment to set up 25 small and medium-sized factories, such as biological products factories and chemical factories. Many classes and groups also set up their own small factories. At present, the school's nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer factory and antibiotic bacteria fertilizer factory each produce ten tons per day. At the same time, they are focusing on scientific research. Teachers and students of the Plant Protection Department worked hard for five days and nights to produce gibberellin crystals, which are now being produced in large quantities. However, the situation of the great leap forward in national agricultural production is still not adapted to the requirements put forward by agricultural education. There is a phenomenon that the teaching content is divorced from reality, and the students trained cannot completely meet the needs of agriculture. This year's labor in the countryside by the Agricultural University will effectively overcome these shortcomings, accelerate the ideological transformation of faculty and students, and run the school better.

    (Our Newspaper News) All teachers, students, and cadres of the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute will also go to the countryside for labor training for one year. The Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute has mobilized all teachers and students, and the vast number of teachers and students have conducted in-depth discussions. The institute has a total of more than 2,300 teachers, students, and staff members, who will be mixed into four brigades and participate in production labor in four regions, including the suburbs of Beijing, Hebei, Henan, and Hubei. A small number of teachers and students will stay in the school's farms and factories to engage in production labor.

　　先作群众学生　再作群众先生
    走出农业大学  开赴农村大学
    北京两所农业高等学校全体师生下乡劳动一年
    本报讯　坚决贯彻执行教育为生产服务，教育和劳动结合的方针，北京农业大学全体教师、干部和学生三千多人下放农村劳动一年，第一批一百多师生26日已开赴山西。
    北京农业大学全体教职人员和学生下放一年是参加基层生产劳动，在劳动中改造思想，兴无灭资，建立和巩固工人阶级观点、群众观点、劳动观点和辩证唯物主义观点，同时，广泛了解所到地区大田作物和畜牧生产的过程，合作社的政治、经济等方面的情况，为将来改革教学计划、教学内容、教学方法和改革科学研究工作打下基础。同时，参加丰产试验田的工作，深入总结农民的丰产经验；组织现场教学，拜“能者”为师，请劳模、干部、农民向师生做报告，并结合当前农业生产所提出的重大问题进行科学研究。他们还将在各种农业技术和文化教育上给农村以大力的支援，例如传授抗生菌、固氮菌的生产技术，协助建立工厂、传授作物杂交选种技术，协助举办农业中学，红专大学，扫除文盲，等等。为了保证完成上述任务，他们将各个专业混合编队。他们将分别下放到北京郊区、河北、河南、山东、山西、内蒙、青海和宁夏等八个地区。少数师生留校继续办工厂和在学校农场从事生产劳动。
    农业大学全体师生干部对党委这一决定展开了热烈的讨论，认为这是办好农业学校和贯彻教育与生产相结合的重要步骤，是改造师生和干部思想，加速把农大办好的正确途径。许多人表示要放下架子，虚心拜农民为师，并且要求到最艰苦的地方去锻炼，农业经济系王玉琪等十八人写的联名信中说：“坚决响应党的号召，无条件的服从分配，自觉的改造思想，做到思想、劳动、学习和锻炼身体四丰收。”
    北京农业大学在整风和双反运动中，批判资产阶级教育思想的基础上，进行了教学改革，开展勤工俭学活动，七个专业和班级到农场进行现场教学，教师也种丰产试验田。7月中旬，康生同志到农大视察工作以后，全校师生又掀起了一个以积肥和加强田间管理为中心的运动，苦战两个月，大搞农业丰产地，并大办工业，在一星期之内，利用原有的设备办起了生物制品厂、化工厂等中小型工厂二十五个，许多班级和小组也自己办起各种小型工厂。现在该校的固氮菌肥料厂和抗生菌肥料厂各日产十吨。与此同时，他们还有重点的进行科学研究，植保系师生苦战五昼夜，制出了赤霉素的结晶，现已进行大量的生产。但是，全国农业生产大跃进的形势对农业教育所提出的要求来说还是不相适应的，教学内容有脱离实际的现象，培养的学生也不能完全适合农业的需要。这次农大下放劳动一年，将会有效的克服这些缺点，加速教职人员和学生的思想改造，把学校办的更好。
    本报讯　北京农业机械化学院全体师生干部也将下放劳动锻炼一年。中共北京农业机械化学院委员会已在全体师生中作了动员，广大师生并进行了深入的讨论。该院共有师生员工二千三百余人，他们将混合编为四个大队，分别到北京郊区、河北、河南、湖北等四个地区参加生产劳动。少部分师生留在校内农场、工厂从事生产劳动。
