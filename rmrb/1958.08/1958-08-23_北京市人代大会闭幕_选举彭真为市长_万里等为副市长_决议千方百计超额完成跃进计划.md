Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: The first session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress, held for ten days, victoriously concluded today.

In addition to discussing and adopting the 1957 final accounts of financial revenue and expenditure and the 1958 budget of financial revenue and expenditure, this conference focused on the question of how to further the leap forward in Beijing's agricultural production, industrial production, and capital construction. During the conference, the representatives also participated in the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's mobilization rallies for the leap forward in agriculture, capital construction, and industry and transportation. In their speeches at the conference and in the resolutions passed by the conference, more than 120 representatives and observers believed that Beijing had achieved great successes in all aspects of its work, but that some work still lagged behind the most advanced levels in the country. The most urgent task at present is to thoroughly overcome conservative thinking, further implement the Party's mass line, mobilize the masses to speak out freely, air their views fully, and hold great debates, allowing grassroots organizations and the broad masses to discuss and ultimately decide their own leap forward targets and the specific measures that should be taken. Only in this way can we further boost the morale of cadres and the masses, promote the spirit of working hard and self-reliantly, and launch a new high tide of the great leap forward on the fronts of industrial and agricultural production and capital construction, taking all effective measures to complete and overfulfill the leap forward plans for industry and capital construction, and striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture.

While electing twenty-nine representatives to the Second National People's Congress, the conference also elected the members of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee and the presidents of the Beijing Municipal Higher and Intermediate People's Courts.

The conference elected Peng Zhen as Mayor of Beijing, Wan Li, Feng Jiping, Wu Han, Wang Kunlun, Cheng Hongyi, Jia Tingsan, and Le Songsheng as Vice Mayors of Beijing, and Wang Chun and thirty-nine others as members of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee. The conference also elected Lin Tong as President of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court and Wang Liang as President of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court.

The conference adopted the report of the Proposals Examination Committee on the examination of proposals. During the conference, a total of more than 550 proposals were received from the representatives. The Proposals Examination Committee has put forward suggestions for handling these proposals and handed them over to the next Beijing Municipal People's Committee for handling.
