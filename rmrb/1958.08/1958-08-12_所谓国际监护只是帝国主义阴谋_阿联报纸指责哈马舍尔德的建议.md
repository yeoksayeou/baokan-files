Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 10th: Damascus newspapers today strongly criticized Hammarskjöld's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to impose some form of international trusteeship on Jordan and Lebanon, pointing out that this was a conspiracy plotted by imperialism.

	The "Victory" newspaper said that some of the basic principles of Hammarskjöld's proposal "are contrary to the principle of Arab unity." It pointed out that "this proposal is in effect an attempt to create some kind of international obstacle to isolate Jordan and Lebanon, turning them into places where imperialist forces can run rampant and bases for exerting pressure and aggression."

	The newspaper also said: "We can say that this plan was plotted by imperialism and its sinister elements."

	The newspaper continued: "Arabs do not reject plans to establish a stable region, but they are unwilling to sacrifice their freedom and territory... in exchange for stability."

	The newspaper concluded: "The only issue that the United Nations General Assembly should discuss is the Anglo-American aggression against the Arabs, because this is the only well-known and direct aggression in the region. Discussing any other issues is a deliberate attempt to avoid discussing the fundamental issue."

	The "Opinion" newspaper said: Hammarskjöld's implication of establishing an international supervisory body in Jordan means that the Secretary-General actually hopes to establish an international police force under the banner of the United Nations, as a tool of imperialism to replace the British invading army, in order to impose a regime on the Jordanian Arab people that they hate and are trying to overthrow.

　　所谓国际监护只是帝国主义阴谋
　　阿联报纸指责哈马舍尔德的建议
    据新华社大马士革10日电　大马士革报纸今天纷纷抨击哈马舍尔德在联合国大会上提出的要求把某种国际监护强加于约旦和黎巴嫩的建议，指出这是帝国主义策划出来的阴谋。
    “胜利报”说：哈马舍尔德建议中的某些基本原则“是同阿拉伯团结的原则相违背的”。它指出，“这个建议实际上是无异于企图造成某种国际障碍来把约旦和黎巴嫩孤立起来，把它们变成任凭帝国主义势力横行的场所和施加压力与进行侵略的基地”。
    这家报纸又说：“我们可以说，这个计划是帝国主义及其心怀叵测的分子所策划出来的。”
    报纸又说：“阿拉伯人并不拒绝建立一个安定地区的计划，但是他们不愿意牺牲他们的自由与领土……来换取安定。”
    这家报纸最后说：“联合国大会所应该讨论的唯一问题就是英美侵略阿拉伯人的问题，因为这是这个地区唯一人所共知的直接侵略。讨论任何其他问题都是有意回避讨论基本问题。”
    “舆论报”说：哈马舍尔德暗示要在约旦建立国际监督机构，这意味着秘书长实际上希望在联合国的旗帜下建立一支国际警察部队，作为帝国主义的工具来代替英国侵略军，以便把一个为约旦的阿拉伯人民所憎恨与力图推翻的政权强加在他们头上。
