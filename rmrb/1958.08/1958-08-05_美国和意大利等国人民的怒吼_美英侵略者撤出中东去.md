The petition states: "In our own war for national independence, our ancestors fought heroically to free our country from foreign rule. So why send our youth to the Middle East now, to die in order to maintain the very oppression our ancestors left Europe to escape?"

The petition also demands that British troops withdraw from Jordan.

The foundry workers at the Ford Motor Factory in River Rouge, Michigan, sent a telegram to U.S. President Eisenhower, also demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. Marines from Lebanon.

The Canadian branch of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers’ newspaper, "The Mining Worker," also condemned Anglo-American intervention in the Middle East, believing that this intervention was an aggression orchestrated to protect the oil and profits of Anglo-American oil monopolies, and called on the people to demand "the immediate recall of foreign troops, to let the people of the Middle East decide their own future and establish their own government."

The United Electrical Workers Union sent a telegram to the Canadian government, asking it to use all its influence to "uphold peace, oppose aggression and prevent interference in the internal affairs of other countries."

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: According to the Argentine "Times" of July 21st and 22nd, the Argentine people have continued to protest against the armed aggression of U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East in recent days.

The Argentine Railway Workers' Union pointed out in a statement that the U.S. and British military actions in the Middle East "are a threat to world peace." Many famous Argentine writers have also issued statements demanding that the United Nations urge "the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan."

The construction workers' union of Buenos Aires Province, the construction workers of Rosario, and many political and social figures in Argentina have also fiercely condemned the aggressive actions of the United States and Britain.

Residents of Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires, Mendoza, Santa Fe, Córdoba, and Tucumán held demonstrations and rallies on July 20th to oppose U.S. and British armed intervention in the Middle East and demand the withdrawal of the invading forces.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: TASS Rome, August 3rd: News of large-scale rallies and demonstrations to defend peace has been pouring in from all over Italy. According to "Unità," a grand rally was held in Modena. Pajetta, a secretary of the Communist Party Secretariat, spoke at the rally, condemning the crimes of U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East and condemning Italy's police repression of demonstrators defending peace.

Pajetta refuted Italian Prime Minister Fanfani's claim that Italy was pursuing a "new policy" of establishing friendly relations with Arab countries in the Middle East, saying: "To act as a tool of the Americans, to provide them with bases and to act as their agents - is to act as an enemy of the Arab people, an enemy of the progress, unity and independence of the Arab people."

Peace demonstrations have been held in many towns and villages in Umbria, Marche, Calabria, Sardinia and other regions. A general strike was held in Ponte a Egola (Florence), which was attended by all workers, peasants and craftsmen in the region.

According to "Unità," a large-scale movement to support Togliatti, Secretary General of the Italian Communist Youth Federation, is underway throughout the province of Pisa. Togliatti is being tried by the court for "organizing demonstrations" to protest against Anglo-American aggression.
