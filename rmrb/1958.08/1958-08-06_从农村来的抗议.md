    Protest from the Countryside
    Zou Difan
    When I walked through the orchard,
    The old man spraying pesticide widened his eyes:
    "The American imperialists want to start a war?
    This sprayer won't allow 'war bugs' to survive!"
    When I walked through the cornfield,
    Young women were busy applying fertilizer:
    "The American imperialists want to invade the Middle East?
    Corncobs will turn into hand grenades to fight them!"
    When I walked along the paddy field ridges,
    People bent over, pulling up weeds,
    Raising their heads, they opened their angry eyes:
    "Rice ears can also become flames to burn the enemy!"
    When I walked through the pig farm,
    The breeder's face was flushed:
    "Imperialists want to set fire to steal livestock?
    The militiamen's rifles won't spare them either!"
    When I walked through the pumping station,
    Mechanized electric water blossomed angrily in the countryside,
    The laborers raised their iron pickaxes in one hand,
    And wrote with the other: Use work to protect peace.
    When I walked through the great mountains,
    The peasants searched for minerals in the white clouds:
    "We can move the mountains,
    How can we not have the strength to protect peace!?"
    When I walked through every piece of land in the countryside,
    Everywhere the seedlings were strong, the fruits plump, and the leaves green.
    Every plot was a high-yield land,
    As if the slogans at the edge of the fields were filled with peace.
    The force of peace fills the countryside,
    The anti-imperialist voice covers the eastern sky.
    Every mu of high-yield land is a fortress of peace:
    Strike the invaders, support our friends!

    从农村来的抗议
    邹荻帆
    当我走过果林，
    喷药老人瞪大眼睛：
    “美帝要发动战争？
    这喷药器不准‘战争虫’生存！”
    当我走过玉米田，
    青年妇女正忙追肥粪：
    “美帝要侵略中东？
    玉米棒要变成手榴弹和他们拚！”
    当我走过稻田埂，
    人们弯着腰拔草根，
    抬起头，他们睁着愤怒的眼睛：
    “稻穗也能变成火焰烧敌人！”
    当我走过养猪场，
    饲养员满脸火腾腾：
    “帝国主义想放火抢牲口？
    民兵的火枪也不能饶他们！”
    当我走过扬水站，
    机械电力的水花怒放在乡村，
    民工们一手高举铁镐头，
    一手写着：用工作保和平。
    当我走过大山岭，
    农民们寻矿上白云：
    “大山我们搬得动，
    还没有力量保和平！？”
    当我走过农村每一块地，
    处处苗壮果肥叶子青。
    块块都是丰产地，
    好像地头标语写满和平。
    和平力量满农村，
    反帝的声音盖满东边天。
    每亩丰产田地都是和平的堡垒：
    打击侵略者，支援友人！
