    The Tide of History
    Lin Ling
    Premier Zhou Enlai said at the reception celebrating the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia that although the colonialists obstruct and undermine the national independence movements of the Asian and African peoples, "they absolutely cannot resist the advance of the tide of history."
    The tide of historical development has laws that do not depend on people's will. With the development of capitalism, the turbid current of plundering colonies once swept the world; but with the development of the socialist movement, the national colonial liberation movement has surged throughout the world with irresistible force.
    When the Portuguese first landed in Guangzhou in 1516 (the eleventh year of Zhengde in the Ming Dynasty), marking the beginning of the intrusion of Western countries' tentacles of aggression into China, it was the period of primitive accumulation of capitalism. China, as well as many countries in Asia, Africa, and Australia, became more and more deeply trapped in the network of colonies as capitalism entered the monopoly period and the era of imperialism. However, as time passed, when capitalism developed to the age of imperialism, that is, when the free occupation of colonies developed to the monopolistic occupation era, and the world that had already been divided had to be re-divided, the tide of history swept in the imperialist war.
    However, along with this tide, another surge of anger surged in, turning the colonies from the reserve force of imperialism into the reserve force of the proletarian revolution: the October Socialist Revolution forty-one years ago began a new direction in the tide of history; nine years ago, China broke free from the colonial network and strengthened the national independence and socialist movement, making this movement the mainstream of world history, and the torrent of this mainstream overwhelmed the stagnant and foul currents of the old capitalist world.
    The wave of liberation now surging among the Arab people in Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and other places in western Asia is irresistible precisely because it is a giant wave in the general tide of world history. Therefore, Premier Zhou emphasized again: "Today, the people of Asia and Africa have stood up, and the tide of national independence in Asia and Africa is unstoppable."
    The struggle against the colonial system, as a trend of world history, is rewriting the history of the world and redrawing the maps of the world with the force of a thunderbolt.
    The "pioneer colonists" who "discovered" and "opened up" new lands during the period of primitive accumulation of capitalism regarded themselves as the masters of the world, took Europe where they lived as the center, called East Asia the Far East, and called the junction of Asia and Africa and West Asia part of the Middle East and part of the Near East. These geographical names with a strong colonial atmosphere will be swept away by the tide of history and blown away by the east wind that overwhelms the west wind with the collapse of the colonial system, never to return.
    When Chairman Mao answered the credentials presented by the new Indian Ambassador to China, he used the term "West Asia," a name "according to its master," for the place where the colonialists are now carrying out aggression in Lebanon, Jordan, etc. Premier Zhou also used this term instead of the usual term "Middle East" at the reception celebrating the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia. This has profound significance.
    The tide of history is unstoppable. Both "metropolitan countries" and "colonies" will be washed away by the tide, and all nouns bearing the imprint of the old capitalist world will be refreshed or completely washed away.

    历史的潮流
    林陵
    周恩来总理在中柬两国建交招待会上说，尽管殖民主义者阻挠和破坏亚非人民的民族独立运动，“但是他们绝对抵挡不住历史潮流的前进”。
    历史发展的潮流有不以人们意志为转移的规律。随着资本主义的发展，掠夺殖民地的浊流曾经在世界上泛滥过；但是随着社会主义运动的发展，民族殖民地解放运动就以不可阻挡之势，在全世界汹涌澎湃着。
    当1516年（明朝正德十一年）葡萄牙人初次在广州登陆而开始了西方国家侵略触须伸入中国的时候，正是资本主义原始积累的时期。中国以及亚洲、非洲、澳洲等许多国家，随着资本主义进入垄断时期和帝国主义时代而愈来愈深地陷在殖民地的罗网里。然而星移斗转，当资本主义发展到帝国主义时代，也就是殖民地的自由占领发展到垄断占有时代，已经瓜分的世界不得不重新瓜分的时候，历史的潮流就冲来了帝国主义战争。
    然而随着这个潮流又汹涌来一股怒潮，它把殖民地从帝国主义的后备军变成了无产阶级革命的后备军：四十一年前的十月社会主义革命开始了历史潮流的新方向，九年前中国从殖民地的罗网中挣脱出来而壮大了民族独立和社会主义运动，使这一运动成为世界历史的主流，而且这一主流的狂澜压倒了资本主义旧世界的已成死水的又浊又臭之流。
    现在汹涌在亚洲西部伊拉克、黎巴嫩、约旦等地阿拉伯人民中的解放浪潮，所以不可阻挡，正因为它是世界历史总潮流中的巨浪。因此周总理又强调说：“今天，亚非人民已经站起来了，亚非民族独立的潮流是不可阻挡的”。
    反对殖民制度的斗争，作为世界历史的潮流，正以雷霆万钧之势的冲击力量，在改写着世界的历史，改画着世界的地图。
    在资本主义原始积累时期“发现”和“开辟”新土地的“前辈殖民者”以世界的主人自居，把他们居住的欧洲作为中心，把东亚叫做远东，把亚非衔接地方以及西亚，一部分叫做中东，一部分叫做近东，这种带着浓厚的殖民主义气息的地理名词，将随着殖民制度的崩溃，一去不复返地被历史潮流所冲掉，被压倒了西风的东风所吹掉。
    毛主席在新任印度驻华大使递交国书后致答词时，把殖民主义者现在在黎巴嫩、约旦等进行侵略的地方，用了“名从其主”的名称“西亚”，周总理在中柬建交招待会上也用了这个名词代替惯用的“中东”字样。这是有深远意义的。
    历史的潮流是无法阻挡的，“宗主国”、“殖民地”都要受到潮流的冲刷，一切带着资本主义旧世界烙印的名词也将被刷新或完全冲掉。
