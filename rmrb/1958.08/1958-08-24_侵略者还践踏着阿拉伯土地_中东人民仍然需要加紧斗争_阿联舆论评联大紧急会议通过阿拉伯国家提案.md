Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 23rd: A Cairo radio commentary on the 22nd pointed out that the situation in the Middle East would not be shelved as the United States and Britain hoped after the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Arab states' proposal on the Middle East issue. The commentary stated that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's speech indicated that if the United States and Britain delayed the withdrawal of their invading forces, the Soviet Union would raise the issue again at the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Moussa Sabry, editor-in-chief of the Cairo newspaper "Al Misaa," wrote in an editorial for the paper on the 22nd that imperialism still has one foot on Arab land, and Arabs must always be vigilant.

Sabry said that the next stage is a stage of political struggle, which is arduous for the Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 22nd: Damascus newspapers "Al Jamahir," "Ar-Ra'i Al-'Amm," and other newspapers all published editorials today, believing that the Arab states' proposal unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly emergency session on the morning of the 21st was a victory for Arab nationalism and a shameful defeat for the imperialist aggressor states headed by the United States and Britain.

"An-Nour" pointed out that the main issue that Arab and world public opinion is paying attention to now is the withdrawal of American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The newspaper asked: "Does the Arab proposal have reliable guarantees for the withdrawal of U.S. and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan? The proposal contains clauses on this issue, but are these clauses, as currently worded, sufficient to be a guarantee for the early withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan and to prevent imperialism from attempting to distort the interpretation of this clause to help them delay?"

"An-Nour" finally called on the people to "remain fully prepared and vigilant so that when imperialists attempt to distort the proposal to help them delay or impose conditions on their withdrawal from Lebanon and Jordan, we can expose their conspiracies."

　　侵略者还践踏着阿拉伯土地  中东人民仍然需要加紧斗争
    阿联舆论评联大紧急会议通过阿拉伯国家提案
    据新华社开罗23日电　开罗电台22日发表评论指出，联合国大会一致通过阿拉伯国家关于中东问题的提案后中东局势问题并不会像美国和英国所希望的那样搁置起来。评论说，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的发言指出，如果美国和英国拖延撤退侵略军的话，苏联将在联合国大会常会上再次提出这个问题。
    开罗“晚报”主编毛希丁在22日为这家报纸写的社论说，帝国主义目前仍然有一只脚践踏在阿拉伯的土地上，阿拉伯人必须永远保持警惕。
    毛希丁说，下一步是一个政治斗争的阶段，这个斗争对阿拉伯人民来说是艰巨的。
    据新华社大马士革22日电　大马士革“群众报”、“舆论报”和其它报纸今天都发表社论，认为联合国大会紧急会议在21日上午一致通过的阿拉伯国家提案，是阿拉伯民族主义的胜利，是美国和英国为首的帝国主义侵略国家的可耻失败。
    “光明报”指出，现在阿拉伯和世界舆论注意的主要问题是美国和英国军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出的问题。报纸问道：“阿拉伯提案有没有实现美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的可靠保证？提案中包含关于这个问题的条款，但是这个条款照目前的措词来看是不是足以成为外国军队早日撤出黎巴嫩和约旦以及防止帝国主义设法歪曲解释这个条款以帮助他们进行拖延的保证？”
    “光明报”最后号召人民“保持充分准备和警惕，以便在帝国主义者企图曲解提案来帮助他们进行拖延或者对他们撤出黎巴嫩和约旦提出条件的时候，揭破他们的阴谋。”
