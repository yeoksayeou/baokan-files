　　Always Be Vigilant, Always Be Prepared!
　　Cai Yun
    Opposing war and defending peace is the demand of people all over the world today, and the socialist camp and communists stand at the forefront of this ranks. The reason why communists and the people of the socialist camp cherish peace so much is because the ideal of communists is to let all mankind live a happy and peaceful life. This is a good wish and a sacred ideal. But to realize this ideal, we must go through struggle, and first of all, we must eliminate the evil forces that hinder and prevent us from realizing this ideal, that is, the small handful of imperialists in the world who disrupt peace, launch aggression, and create wars and tense situations. If the peace-loving people do not rise up to struggle, or if the degree of this struggle cannot reach the point of tying the hands of war maniacs, then the possibility of war cannot be eliminated. This shows that our socialist countries are peaceful in nature. We need peace, and we pursue peace. At the same time, this also shows that the conditions for our peaceful construction are obtained through struggle, and the continuation of peaceful construction must also be defended through struggle.

    Imperialist countries, on the contrary, are essentially demanding war, although in the face of powerful peace forces, they do not dare to easily launch war. Because imperialist countries rely on robbery and plunder to start their rule, they begin to establish their rule through wars of aggression, and they still want to carry out wars of aggression to maintain their rule.

    Socialism means peace, imperialism means war.

    As long as capitalism exists for one day, the possibility of war exists for one day. As soon as one war ends, the imperialist scoundrels and villains immediately prepare for the next war; between wars, they want to maintain tense situations; when the tense situation eases slightly, they fan the flames to make the situation tense again. The profession of a robber is to kill and set fire. When a robber is still at large, he will not stop killing and setting fire. To make robbers stop killing and setting fire, it is useless to persuade them peacefully. It will only be effective when they understand that they will be in big trouble if they commit crimes.

    By examining the essence of imperialism, we can find the root cause of war and tense situations. But socialist countries demand peace from their own essence, so they try their best to take various measures to defend peace and prevent war. But we know that peace cannot be waited for to fall from the sky, nor can it be begged from the enemy. To maintain peace requires struggle, and to prevent war also requires struggle. When our strength is strong enough to prevent war, we say that war is not inevitable, but this does not mean that imperialism will violate its own nature and abandon war. Therefore, we must always be vigilant and always be prepared to use our just war to eliminate the enemy's war. Because we are peaceful in nature, we try our best to ease tense situations, but we are not easing for the sake of easing. We are striving for easing in order to defeat the enemy, to take away the tense situation that the enemy needs, and to strive for peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition in easing.

    The enemy does not want peace; the enemy is afraid of peace. The enemy's situation is getting worse and worse, and our strength is getting stronger and stronger. When we have to fight, we are never afraid of war. We will defeat the enemy and eliminate the enemy in the war to achieve lasting peace!

    反对战争，保卫和平，这是当前全世界人民的要求，社会主义阵营和共产党人站在这个行列的最前线。共产党人和社会主义阵营的人民所以如此珍视和平，是因为共产主义者的理想就是要让全人类过幸福美满的和平生活。这是善良的愿望，神圣的理想。但是要实现这理想，必须通过斗争，首先必须扫除妨碍和阻止我们实现这理想的恶势力，这就是世界上那一小撮破坏和平，发动侵略，制造战争和紧张局势的帝国主义者。和平人民倘不起来斗争或者是这种斗争开展的程度不能达到缚住战争狂人的双手的时候，战争的可能性就是无法消除的。这说明，我们社会主义国家在本质上就是和平的，我们需要和平，我们追求和平。同时，这又说明我们和平建设的条件是通过斗争取得的，而和平建设的继续也要通过斗争来保卫。
    帝国主义国家，则相反，它们在本质上是要求战争的，尽管在强大的和平力量面前，它们并不敢轻易的发动战争。因为帝国主义国家是靠抢劫掠夺起家，开始建立自己的统治，是通过侵略战争，维持自己的统治，还是要进行侵略战争。
    社会主义就是和平，帝国主义就是战争。
    资本主义存在一天，战争的可能性就存在一天。一次战争刚结束，帝国主义的坏蛋恶棍们立刻又准备下一次战争；在战争与战争之间，他们要维持紧张局势；在紧张局势稍见缓和的时候，他们就煽风点火，使局势重见紧张。强盗的职业就是杀人放火，强盗还逍遥法外的时候，他就不会不杀人放火。要使强盗停止杀人放火，依靠向他们进行和平的劝善是不行的，只有使他们明白了要行凶就要倒大霉时，才会有效。
    考察帝国主义的本质，我们就可以找到战争和紧张局势的根源。但是社会主义国家从自己的本质上要求和平，所以它竭力采取种种办法，保卫和平，制止战争。但是我们知道和平不能等候自天而降，也不能乞求敌人给予，维持和平要斗争，阻止战争也要斗争。在我们力量强大得足以制止战争的时候，我们说战争并不是不可避免的，但是这决不是说，帝国主义会违反自己的本性，放弃战争，因此，我们必须随时警惕，随时准备，用我们的正义战争来消灭敌人的战争。因为我们本质上是和平的，我们想尽办法缓和紧张局势，但是我们不是为了缓和而缓和，我们是为了战胜敌人，为了夺去敌人所需要的紧张局势，而争取缓和，在缓和中争取和平共处，进行和平竞赛。
    敌人不要和平，敌人怕和平。敌人的处境愈来愈恶劣，我们的力量愈来愈强大。非战不行的时候，我们决不害怕战争，我们要在战争中战胜敌人，消灭敌人，实现永久和平！
