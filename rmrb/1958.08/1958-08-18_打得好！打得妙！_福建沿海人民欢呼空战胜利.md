Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 16th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Kuihua reports: In the past few days, as the war eagles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have continuously and painfully annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's military aircraft that trespassed on the coastal areas of Fujian, fishermen and farmers who witnessed these air battles everywhere enthusiastically cheered the brilliant victory of our air force's consecutive battles.

　　At about 10 a.m. on the 14th, fishermen in Meihua Town of Changle County and Pingtan Island outside the Minjiang River Estuary were operating a large number of fishing boats at sea to chase fish schools, while farmers and fishermen along the coast were also engaged in peaceful labor on beaches and farmland. Suddenly, with a buzzing sound, groups of black dots scurried from the sea towards the inland. At this time, fishermen and farmers with long-term experience in fighting the enemy clearly identified them as the remnant Chiang Kai-shek's aerial bandits coming to harass.

　　At this moment, our People's Air Force aircraft group swept across the sky and bravely met the invading enemy planes. Fishermen and farmers immediately waved and cheered at the heroic People's Air Force aircraft group: "Our planes, ours, hurry up and chase them, don't let the bandits run away!" "Boom... Boom," a fierce air battle broke out. Amidst the clouds of smoke and the sound of artillery fire, the enemy planes were beaten by our air force aircraft group and fled in embarrassment. Among them, two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft shot down, one crashed outside the Minjiang River Estuary and the other plunged into the sea east of Pingtan Island. The damaged enemy plane dragged a plume of black smoke and fled. At this time, the fishermen and farmers jumped up with joy. Some raised their tools, some threw the clothes in their hands into the air..., and shouted in unison, "Shot down, shot down!" When the fishermen on Dongyang Island, Pingtan County, who are frequently harassed and destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft, saw the downed Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft plunging headlong into the sea not far from the east of Pingtan, and splashing dozens of feet high of water, they shouted happily, "Well fought, wonderful fight! Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft went into the seabed to find the 'Sea Dragon King'." Lin Meili, whose husband was bombed to death by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft in 1952, said: "The blood debt owed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits will be repaid with blood." Huang Yingdi, a 68-year-old fisherman in Meihua Town, pointed to Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft that crashed into the sea and danced with joy. He said: "We have such a strong air force, the old man is really happy."

　　打得好！打得妙！
　　福建沿海人民欢呼空战胜利
    据新华社福建前线16日电　新华社记者刘葵华报道：几天来，当中国人民解放军的战鹰连续痛歼窜扰福建沿海地区的蒋军飞机时，目击这些空战场面的渔民和农民们，到处热烈欢呼我空军连战皆捷的辉煌胜利。
    14日上午十时许，闽江口外长乐县梅花镇和平潭岛一带渔民们，正驾驶大批渔船在海上追捕鱼群，沿海一带农民和渔民也在海滩和农田里进行和平劳动。突然，随着一阵嗡嗡声，一群群黑点从海面上空窜向内陆。这时，有着长期对敌斗争经验的渔民和农民，已清楚辨认出是前来骚扰的残余蒋军空中强盗。
    正在这时，我人民空军机群掠空而过，英勇迎击来犯敌机。渔民和农民们立即向英雄的人民空军机群招手欢呼：“我们的飞机，我们的，赶快追上去，不要让强盗跑掉！”“轰……轰”，一阵激烈的空战打开了，在团团烟云和炮火声中，敌机被我空军机群打得狼狈逃窜，其中被击落的两架蒋机，一架坠落在闽江口外，一架栽入平潭岛东面的大海里，被击伤的一架敌机拖着一股黑烟飞逃。这时渔民和农民们高兴的都跳起来，有的举起工具，有的把手里的衣物向空中抛去……，齐声欢呼“打下来了，打下来了！”当经常遭受蒋机骚扰破坏的平潭县东庠岛渔民看到被打落的蒋机一头栽向平潭东面不远的大海，远远击起数丈高的水柱时，一起高兴地大叫说：“打得好，打得妙，蒋军飞机钻入海底找‘海龙王’去了。”1952年被蒋机炸死丈夫的林梅丽说：“蒋匪欠我们的血债用血来还了。”六十八岁的梅花镇老渔民黄硬俤指着栽入海里的蒋机，高兴的手舞足蹈起来，他说：“我们有这样强大的空军，老汉心里真高兴。”
