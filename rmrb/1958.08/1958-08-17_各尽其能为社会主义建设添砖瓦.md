　　Each Contributing Their Ability to Add Bricks and Tiles to Socialist Construction
　　Yang Xuan
    "Everyone labors, each striving to be first; people-run industries, vigorously develop production." This is a wall poster poem from West Lane, Erlong Road, Beijing. This poem truly expresses the enthusiasm of the older women and women in this lane for everyone to labor and vigorously develop production.
    The day before yesterday, Elder Sister Guo led me on a tour of West Lane. In the dozen or so courtyards on the north and south sides of the lane, almost every courtyard is a factory. There is the "East Wind Shoe Processing Production Group," the "Giant Dragon Hat Processing Production Group," the "People-Run Sock Weaving Factory," the "Leap Forward Photo Developing and Printing Service"... Truly, those who stitch shoes are stitching shoes; those who weave socks are weaving socks; some are attaching hat brims; some are developing photographs. No household has an idle person, no street has a loafer.
    An old woman at the Leap Forward Photo Developing and Enlarging Service is diligently coloring photographs. The photos that have been colored are so beautiful and lovable. There are also two old women taking care of several little babies in the nursery class. Each chubby baby is sleeping so soundly! It seems that under the care of the grandmothers, they have long forgotten their mothers who have gone out to labor and produce.
    Those who can do needlework do needlework, those who know how to develop photos develop photos. Those who cannot directly participate in production run hot water service stations and nurseries. You do whatever you can do, as long as you have a skill, as long as you sincerely add bricks and tiles to socialist construction, you can contribute your strength. This is how the residents of West Lane paid attention to using various methods to ensure that everyone could exert their strength when organizing production.
    I heard that some streets are also struggling with a lack of production avenues when organizing production. Some want to set up factories but lack people with the necessary technical skills; some have this or that technical skill, but have not organized themselves. In fact, if we all did as they do in West Lane, making the most of everyone's strengths, doing what they can do, forming large groups where possible; small groups are also fine where large groups are not possible, then there will be more production avenues. Of course, if there are indeed some factories that need to be set up, we can also organize some people to specifically learn the technology. As long as you study diligently, there is nothing you cannot learn. Let each of us do our best, go all out, and add a brick and a tile to socialist construction!

### 各尽其能为社会主义建设添砖瓦

　　各尽其能为社会主义建设添砖瓦
　　杨萱
    “人人劳动，个个争先；民办工业，大搞生产。”这是北京市二龙路西巷的墙头诗。这首诗，真切地道出了住在这里的大妈、大嫂们人人劳动、大搞生产的劲头。
    前天，郭大姐领我参观了西巷。在巷内南北两排十几个院里，几乎每个院子都是一个工厂。那里有“东风制鞋加工生产组”，“巨龙制帽加工生产组”，“民办织袜工厂”，“跃进照片洗印服务社”……。真是绱鞋的绱鞋；织袜的织袜；有的扎帽沿；有的印相片，家无闲人，街无白丁。
    跃进照片洗印放大服务社里的一位老大娘，在认真地给相片上颜色。已经染好颜色的相片，是那么美丽惹人爱。还有两位老大娘，正在照看幼儿班的几个小宝宝。一个个胖胖的娃娃睡得多么香甜啊！好像在老奶奶的照看下，早已忘了他们的出去劳动生产的妈妈。
    能作针线的作针线，会印相片的洗相片。没有直接参加生产的，就搞开水服务站和托儿班。你会作啥就作啥，只要你有一技之长，只要你真心诚意给社会主义建设添点砖沫瓦片，你就能把自己的力量贡献出来。这就是西巷的居民们在组织生产的时候，注意了用各种办法让每一个人都能使上劲。
    听说也有些街道在组织生产中，苦于生产门路不多。有的虽然想办一些工厂，又缺乏会那几门技术的人；有个把会这样或那样技术的，又没有组织起来。其实，如果咱们都像西巷那样，尽量发挥每一个人的特长，能干啥的就干啥，能组成大组的就组成大组；不能组成大组的，小组也无妨，那么，生产门路就会多起来。当然，如果确实有些工厂需要办，还可以组织一些人专门去学技术。只要专心学习，没有学不会的。让我们每一个人都各尽所能、鼓足干劲，为社会主义建设添上一砖一瓦吧！
