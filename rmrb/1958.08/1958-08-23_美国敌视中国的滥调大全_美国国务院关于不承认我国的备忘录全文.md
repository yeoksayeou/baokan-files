A paper full of slander and abuse cannot conceal the wails of failure.
Since the Communists came to power in China, the policy toward Communist China has been an important issue, and today it is of great significance to the United States and the free world. In the United States, this is a very real issue for the vast majority of people. As a result of the Korean and Chinese Communist aggression in Korea, the United States suffered 142,000 casualties, bringing tragedy to the whole country.

Despite the pain caused by this, and despite the American people's abhorrence of the brutality and utter lack of morality of the communist system, the U.S. government's policy toward China must be based on an objective consideration of national interests, and it also reflects a constant assessment of all available facts.

Fundamentally, the U.S. policy of diplomatic non-recognition of the Chinese Communist regime stems from the belief that such recognition would not produce practical benefits for the United States or the free world as a whole, and would greatly help the Chinese Communist Party's attempt to expand the realm of communism throughout Asia. It is not an "inflexible" policy that cannot be changed as circumstances change. If the situation in the Far East changes in its fundamental elements, requiring a completely different assessment of the threat posed to the security interests of the United States and the free world by the Chinese Communist policy, the United States will, of course, adjust its current policy. However, the course of events in the Far East since the establishment of the Chinese Communist regime in 1949 has so far confirmed the U.S. view that diplomatic non-recognition of the Peking regime is most in line with the interests of the United States and the free world.

Slandering our peaceful policy, creating excuses for expanding aggression
The U.S. policy toward China is based on two basic considerations. First, the Soviet bloc (of which Communist China is an important part) is engaged in a long-term struggle to undermine the way of life of free nations around the world and establish communist rule throughout the world. The CPC regime makes no secret of its fundamentally hostile attitude toward the United States and the entire free world, nor does it conceal its openly declared intention to bring them down. Today, its contempt and attacks on the non-communist world have reached an intensity not seen since the Korean War. The second basic factor is that East Asia is particularly vulnerable to the Communist offensive because the free countries in that region are close to Communist China, those countries that have recently won independence lack experience in governance, their colonial history has created an inherent suspicion of the West, and their modernization processes are bound to bring about social, political, and economic changes.

The Chinese Communist Party believes that communism is bound to triumph in Asia; now that they control the vast population and territory of mainland China, they are using these to their advantage to achieve their goals. The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party have shown by their words and deeds that their primary concern is not to improve the welfare of their people in peaceful coexistence with their neighbors. Their primary aim is to extend the communist revolution beyond their borders to other parts of Asia, and then from there to the rest of the world. Liu Shaoqi, the number two figure in the Chinese Communist Party, once said: "The most basic and general responsibility of a Communist Party member is to build communism and transform the present world into a communist world."
(See "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," slightly different from the original text—translator) Mao Zedong himself once said that his regime's policy was to "actively support the national independence and liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America." The Chinese Communist aggression against Korea and its provision of arms and other assistance to communist rebels in Indochina show that these words are not empty talk.

U.S. policy in Asia, as elsewhere in the world, is to promote the domestic welfare of free nations and to consolidate their independence. Since many Asian countries are close to mainland China, and they differ greatly in size and strength from Communist China, this can only be done if the Communist threat is offset. The first requirement of U.S. policy in the Far East is to contain Communist aggression, otherwise free countries will be in serious danger of being overwhelmed by this pressure before they have gathered the strength to resist Communist pressure. To achieve this goal, the United States has provided military assistance to countries at the forefront of the Chinese Communist Party's expansion path—Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam—and has established a common defense security system with other countries in the region. Our efforts in this regard have been successful; since 1954, the Chinese Communists have failed to make further progress through the open use of military force.

The measures taken by the United States and its allies in Asia to safeguard the security of free countries in the region are in the vital interests of other free countries in the world. If the rest of East Asia were to fall to communism, it would have an unfortunate impact on the free world's ability to effectively resist communist aggression elsewhere. The impact on Australia and New Zealand would be particularly severe. If the islands of the Western Pacific and the Southeast Asian peninsula were lost, these countries would be isolated and strategically exposed and vulnerable.

Efforts to halt further Communist expansion cannot be limited to military deterrence. Countermeasures against Chinese Communist subversion and political infiltration are equally necessary. This is especially true since Peking has increasingly used propaganda, subversion, "people's diplomacy," and political intrigue in its dealings with its Asian neighbors since 1955. Peking is trying to obtain in this way what it obviously does not dare to attempt through military conquest. Therefore, the United States believes that in defending the peace and security of Asia, it is just as important to be vigilant against the threat of subversion as it is against the threat of open military attack.

Refusing to grant diplomatic recognition is an important factor in deterring Peking's attempt to expand Communist rule in Asia. Under normal circumstances, a major power's granting of diplomatic recognition not only gives the other party more opportunities to participate in international conferences, but also enhances the other party's international status and prestige. On the other hand, refusing to grant recognition is a definite obstacle to the regime concerned, making it correspondingly more difficult to successfully pursue its foreign policy. A fundamental purpose of the United States in not recognizing Communist China is to deprive it of this benefit, thereby correspondingly limiting its ability to threaten the security of the region.

Supporting the political corpse of the Chiang gang, plotting to occupy Taiwan for a long time
As far as China is concerned, there are some special considerations that influence U.S. policy on the recognition issue. First, although the Chinese Communists have seized most of China, they have not completely conquered the country. The universally recognized legitimate government of China continues to exist and is steadily developing its political, economic, and military strength in Taiwan. The government of the Republic of China controls the strategic island of Taiwan and, with a large army—one of the largest military forces in Asia on the free world side—is a major deterrent to renewed aggression by the CCP. U.S. recognition of Communist China would severely undermine that government, if not completely destroy it. On the other hand, continued U.S. recognition and support for the Republic of China enables it to counter the Chinese Communists' claim to represent the Chinese people and keeps alive the hopes of those Chinese who are determined to eventually liberate their country from Communist rule.

U.S. recognition of Communist China would have an adverse impact on other free governments in Asia, with unimaginable consequences for the cause of the free world in that part of the world. Those countries that are closely allied with the United States and are striving to maintain their independence around the periphery of the CCP's power, particularly Korea and Vietnam, would feel extremely perplexed and frustrated, and would interpret such action as the United States abandoning their cause. They might infer from this that their only hope of survival lies in taking desperate measures, regardless of whether these measures would endanger the peace of the region and the world. Governments farther away from the Chinese border would see U.S. recognition of Communist China as the first step in the U.S. withdrawal from the Far East. Without U.S. support, they cannot long resist Peking's will; some countries would probably conclude that their wisest course is to quickly obtain the best terms possible from Peking. Needless to say, such a development would put the entire free world's position in Asia in the most serious jeopardy.

Afraid that overseas Chinese are loyal to the motherland, and even more afraid that our country will enter the United Nations
Another special consideration related to China is the existence of a large and influential "overseas" Chinese community in most countries of Southeast Asia.

In deciding its policy toward China, the United States has considered the various claims and arguments put forward by those who advocate granting diplomatic recognition to Peking. One of the most frequently mentioned reasons for recognizing China is that reality must be "recognized"; 600 million people cannot be "ignored." These two statements sound appealing on the surface, but in reality, they themselves ignore the reality of the situation. Of course, U.S. policy is based on a full understanding of the fact that the Chinese Communist regime currently controls mainland China. However, in order to deal with a regime, it is not necessary to establish diplomatic relations with it. The United States has not diplomatically recognized Communist China, but it has still conducted lengthy negotiations with representatives of the Chinese Communist Party in the Korean and Indochina armistice talks, and more recently in the Geneva ambassadorial talks. Similarly, U.S. policy by no means "ignores" the existence and aspirations of the Chinese people. Its attitude toward the Chinese people remains that traditional attitude: friendly and sympathetic understanding. Nevertheless, it is clear that our friendship with the Chinese people must not blind us to the threat that the Chinese Communist regime now poses to our security. Moreover, the United States is deeply convinced that the Chinese Communist regime does not represent the true will or aspirations of the Chinese people, and therefore our policy of non-recognition of the Chinese Communist regime is in fact in their ultimate interest.

If these expatriates are controlled by the Chinese Communists, efforts by these countries to build healthy free societies and develop their economies will be severely hampered; the serious threat of communist subversion through these expatriates will arise. If the United States recognizes Communist China, thereby inevitably diminishing the U.S. position and diminishing the position of the Republic of China, this will have an extremely profound psychological impact on the overseas Chinese, so much so that it will inevitably cause a large number of overseas Chinese to shift their allegiance to the communist side. This, in turn, would undermine the ability of the host countries to resist pressures that help promote the expansion of Chinese Communist power.

Another factor to be considered on the China issue is the impact that recognition of the Communist regime would have on the United Nations. If the United States recognizes Peking, this would inevitably lead to Peking sending representatives to participate in the organization. The United States believes that this would damage—if not destroy—the United Nations as an instrument for maintaining international peace. The Korean War was the United Nations' first major effort to halt aggression through collective action. Communist China is a party against whom the United Nations took action, and allowing it to participate in the United Nations while it still has not cleared its name of aggression and disregarded the United Nations' will in Korea would amount to admitting the failure of the United Nations, thereby greatly reducing the likelihood of the success of future United Nations actions against aggression. Moreover, the Republic of China is a founding member of the United Nations with an excellent reputation, and its representatives there have made important contributions to the organization's constructive work. If representatives of the Chinese Communist regime were to replace them in their seats in the United Nations and obtain China's veto power in the Security Council, the organization's ability to fulfill its responsibilities under the Charter to maintain international peace and security would be seriously impaired.

Insisting on a hostile policy toward China, plotting to expand aggression in the Far East
Proponents of recognizing the CCP often argue that, according to the standards of international law applicable to such situations, the Peking regime "has the right to be diplomatically recognized." In the U.S. view, obtaining diplomatic recognition is a privilege, not a right. Moreover, the United States believes that diplomatic recognition is an instrument for implementing national policy, and it is both our right and our duty to use this instrument to uphold our own lofty interests. However, even according to the standards often cited in international law, there is reason to doubt whether the CCP regime is qualified to receive diplomatic recognition. The CCP regime does not rule the entire country of China, and there is a vast force that denies its claim to rule the entire country of China. The Chinese Communist Party, which tightly controls mainland China, is a tiny minority, less than 2% of the Chinese people, and the forced organization, brutal suppression, and forced sacrifice that characterize its rule have caused widespread unrest among the people. To quote Thomas Jefferson, this regime certainly does not represent "the full and declared will of the people." Finally, it has not expressed its intention to fulfill its international obligations. One of its first actions was to abolish the treaties concluded by the Republic of China, except for those treaties that it was willing to continue. As soon as it came to power, it effectively confiscated the property of foreign nationals, including huge British investments, without compensation, even though the United Kingdom quickly recognized it. It has failed to fulfill various obligations it has assumed since then, including the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Accords on Vietnam and Laos, as well as the "Agreed Statement" issued in September 1955, in which it guaranteed to enable all Americans in China to return home "promptly."

Therefore, the U.S. policy on the issue of recognizing Communist China is based on a carefully considered judgment of national interests. Non-recognition of Peking, while continuing to recognize and support the Republic of China, facilitates the United States in achieving its policy objectives in the Far East. Recognition of Peking would seriously hinder the achievement of these objectives and would contribute to the development of Communist power in Asia.

The unbreakable Sino-Soviet unity - no gaps to exploit, just futile grief
It is sometimes said that recognizing Communist China might exert leverage on the Peking regime and eventually succeed in weakening or even breaking Peking's ties with Moscow. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support this belief, and there are some important reasons why this is unlikely. The alliance between Moscow and Peking is long-standing; they established the alliance as early as 1921, when the Chinese Communist Party was founded, at which time representatives of the Communist International played an important role in the Chinese Communist Party.

It is based on a common ideology and common goals of both sides toward the non-communist world. All recent indications suggest that the ties between the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union are very close, not the opposite. The Chinese Communist Party openly supported the Soviet armed intervention in Hungary and unreservedly approved the execution of Nagy and other leaders of the Hungarian uprising. The Chinese Communist Party was also a leader in the recent attacks by the Communist bloc on Yugoslavia for attempting to break away from Kremlin control and pursue national policies. These and other facts show that the two partners in the Sino-Soviet alliance clearly recognize their mutual dependence and attach great importance to the solidarity of the bloc in the face of the free world.

Moreover, the alliance with the Soviet Union is of particular importance to the Chinese Communists because it is a reliable source of weapons and military supplies. The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including Mao Zedong himself, came to power by mastering military force. Therefore, they clearly recognize the importance of military force for them to maintain their power despite opposition at home and abroad and to achieve their foreign policy goals. It is hard to believe that they would dare to risk taking any action that might deprive them of their source of military supplies. For this reason alone, it seems unrealistic to think that recognition of Peking by the United States or other major powers would induce the Chinese Communists to play a "Titoist" role.

In fact, the results are very likely to be exactly the opposite. If the United States diplomatically recognizes Peking—and brings about all the effects caused by enhancing its international prestige—the leaders of Peking are very likely to be more convinced that their policies are correct, and that it is beneficial to continue close cooperation with Moscow.

It is often said that recognizing Communist China is a necessary step to expand trade relations with that country. For the United States, this is certainly not a consideration, because as a result of the Korean War, the United States has imposed an embargo on Peking under the Trading with the Enemy Act. However, even for countries that do hope to expand trade with mainland China, the fact cannot prove the argument that trade depends on recognition. On the contrary, the United Kingdom, which recognized Communist China in 1950, found that it imported more goods from Communist China than Communist China bought from it. On the other hand, West Germany did not recognize Peking, but it had a trade surplus in its trade with mainland China. In any case, opportunities for trade with Communist China are severely limited by the lack of foreign exchange, a situation that is likely to continue for many years. Moreover, such trade will always be subject to Communist policy. As long as Peking deems it beneficial, it will use trade as a means of putting pressure on its trading partners. A prominent example is Japan; recently, because Japan politically refused to make certain concessions, the Chinese Communist Party cut off all trade and even canceled contracts that had already been concluded in retaliation. Therefore, it seems that the benefits of trade with Peking will ultimately prove to be only temporary, not real.

The "Two Chinas" plot is difficult to achieve, fantasizing about subverting our regime
An argument that is often heard is that the Chinese Communists are a "fait accompli," and sooner or later they will be recognized, and it is wiser to submit to this inevitability now than to be forced to do so disgracefully later. Yes, there is no reason to believe that the Chinese Communist regime is on the verge of collapse, but there is also no reason to believe that its current rule in mainland China is permanent. In fact, the "ideological remolding" and mass anti-"rightist" movements that have taken place over the past year have shown clear signs of discontent and unease in Communist China. Because dictatorship suppresses and suffocates all opposition, it creates an illusion of the permanence of its rule, and the rule of the Chinese Communist Party is no exception to this rule. The United States believes that Communist rule in China is not permanent, and that it will eventually disappear. It wants to accelerate this process by not giving Peking diplomatic recognition.

In public discussions of China policy, one suggestion that has attracted a great deal of attention is the so-called "Two Chinas Solution." Simply put, proponents of this solution suggest recognizing the CCP regime as the government of mainland China, while the government in Taipei remains the legitimate government of Taiwan. They argue that such a handling of the China issue has the advantage of giving the Communists only what they already control, while preserving Taiwan, a fortress of military strategic value, for the free world. However, this plan ignores or fails to take into account certain facts of fundamental importance. The Republic of China will not agree to any reduction of its sovereignty over China, and it can be expected to do everything possible to oppose such a solution. If the "Two Chinas Solution" is forcibly implemented against its will, the effectiveness of that government as a loyal ally of the free world cause will be destroyed. Peking would also reject such a solution. In fact, over the past year, Chinese Communist propaganda has repeatedly endeavored to condemn the "Two Chinas" proposal, and, ironically, it has been accusing the U.S. government of trying to implement this plan. Peking attaches great importance to eventually obtaining Taiwan, and has repeatedly stated that it reserves its so-called "right" to seize Taiwan by force if other means fail. It will never agree to any solution that would permanently separate Taiwan from China.

Both Peking and Taipei are strongly opposed to the "Two Chinas" proposal. Therefore, even if such a method could be forcibly implemented by outside institutions, it is not a stable solution. It would then be necessary to constantly monitor to prevent one side or the other from overthrowing the situation by force.

Shouting to uphold a die-hard policy, attempting to block public opinion pressure
It is sometimes said that not recognizing Peking will only turn the Chinese Communists into martyrs, enabling them to portray themselves as innocent and victimized, especially in front of neutralist countries in Asia. It cannot be denied that there are some cases where this is true. But the harm caused by taking the opposite approach far outweighs this harm. It is clear that it is preferable for certain neutral countries that are either unable or unwilling to understand the threats inherent in CCP policy to mistakenly believe that Peking is being treated unfairly, rather than for the allies of the United States in Asia—who are on the front line of preventing CCP expansion—to be confused and frustrated by a measure that seems to them to be contrary to common sense.

Forty-five non-communist countries recognize the Republic of China. Only nineteen non-communist countries have recognized Peking, and most of them did so before the Korean War in 1950. Therefore, people would interpret recognition by a major country of the free world as a major victory for the Chinese Communists, as a sign that the free world is unwilling to resist Communist pressure, and as an extremely harmful proof that there are serious differences of opinion within the free world on how to deal with international Communist expansionist forces. This action would have a particularly serious impact in the Far East. There, the free world countries that are directly exposed to the pressure of CCP expansionism would feel disappointed and confused, and some countries, fearing isolation in the face of Communist power, would undoubtedly be compelled to follow the example of other countries. And countries in other parts of the world may follow the precedent thus set, because the governments of these countries are less clear about the serious nature of the situation in the Far East, and they are less directly affected by the development of the situation in that region. The inevitable result of recognition of the CCP regime by other free countries would be to greatly enhance its reputation, influence, and power, and to make it more difficult to maintain the security interests of the free world in the Pacific region.

　　美国敌视中国的滥调大全
    美国国务院关于不承认我国的备忘录全文
    满纸都是诬蔑谩骂  掩饰不住失败哀鸣
    自从共产党人在中国取得政权以来，对共产党中国的政策一直是一个重要的问题，而且今天它对美国和自由世界具有极大意义。在美国，对绝大多数人民来说，这是一个非常现实的问题。由于朝鲜的和中国的共产党在朝鲜进行侵略的结果，美国遭受了十四万二千人的伤亡，给全国各地带来悲剧。
    尽管由此引起了种种悲痛，尽管美国人民对共产主义制度的残暴性和完全缺乏道德观念感到痛恨，美国政府对华政策仍必须建立在对国家利益的客观考虑的基础上，它还反映了对于一切可以得到的事实的不断的估计。
    从根本上说，美国在外交上不承认中国共产党政权的政策是从这一信念出发的：这种承认对美国或者对整个自由世界都不会产生实际好处，而且会对中国共产党把共产主义的领域扩大到全亚洲的企图有很大帮助。它并不是一项不能随着已经变化了的情况而改变的“没有伸缩性的”政策。如果远东局势在它的基本因素方面发生了变化，从而要求对中国共产党政策给美国和自由世界的安全利益带来的威胁作完全不同的估计的话，美国当然就会调整它的现行政策。然而中国共产党政权在1949年成立以来的远东事件的进程，到现在为止一直证实美国的这种看法：在外交上不承认北平政权是最符合美国和自由世界的利益的。
    诽谤我国和平政策  制造扩大侵略借口
    美国对华政策所根据的基本考虑有两个方面。首先，苏联集团（共产党中国是这个集团的重要组成部分）正在从事破坏全世界自由国家生活方式和在全世界建立共产主义统治的长期斗争。中共政权毫不掩饰它在根本上敌视美国和整个自由世界的态度，也不掩饰它公然宣布的要使它们垮台的意图。今天，它对非共产党世界的蔑视和攻击已经发展到了朝鲜战争以来从未见过的那种强烈的程度。第二个基本因素是东亚特别容易为共产党的攻势所压倒，因为那个地区的自由国家靠近共产党中国，那些最近才赢得独立的国家在治理方面经验不足，它们过去的殖民地历史造成它们对西方有一种固有的怀疑，并且它们向现代化发展的过程必然会带来社会、政治、经济等方面的变化。
    中国共产党认为共产主义在亚洲必然会获胜；既然他们控制了大陆中国的众多的人口和广大的领土，他们现在就利用这些东西给他们的有利条件来实现他们的目标。中国共产党的领袖们以自己的言语和行动表明，它们主要关心的并不是在同邻国和平相处的情况下增进他们的人民的福利。他们的主要目的是要把共产主义革命扩展到他们国境之外的亚洲其他地区，然后再从那里扩展到世界其他地区。中国共产党的第二号人物刘少奇曾经说过：“共产党员最基本、最一般的责任就是要建立共产主义，把现世界改造成为共产主义的世界。”
  （见“论共产党员的修养”与原文略有不同——译者）毛泽东本人曾经说过，他的政权的政策是“积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族独立和解放运动”。中国共产党对朝鲜的侵略和它向印度支那共产党叛乱分子提供军火和其他援助的做法说明这些言论并不是空话。
    美国对亚洲的政策像对全世界别的地方一样，是为了促进自由国家的国内福利和巩固它们的独立。由于许多亚洲国家紧靠大陆中国，而它们同共产党中国在大小和力量方面相差悬殊，因此，这只有在共产党的威胁受到抵销的情况下才能做到。美国对远东政策的第一个要求是遏止共产党的侵略，否则自由国家就会在自己还没有聚集好抵抗共产党压力的力量以前就被这种压力压倒的严重危险。为了实现这个目的，美国对中国共产党扩张道路上首当其冲的国家——朝鲜、台湾和越南——提供了军事援助，同该地区的其他国家建立了一个共同防御安全体系。我们在这方面的努力很成功；自从1954年以来，中国共产党人一直未能通过公开使用军事力量取得更多的进展。
    美国和它在亚洲的盟国为了维护这个地区自由国家的安全所采取的各项措施，是符合世界上其他自由国家的切身利益的。如果东亚其余地区为共产主义所得，那就会对自由世界有效地抵抗共产主义在别处的侵略的能力发生不幸的影响。对于澳大利亚和新西兰的影响会特别严重。如果西太平洋各岛和东南亚半岛都失掉，这些国家就会陷于孤立，并且在战略上处于暴露和危险的地位。
    制止共产党的进一步扩张的努力不能够只限于军事威慑力量。对付中国共产党颠复和政治渗入的反措施是同样必要的。由于北平自从1955年以来在它同它的亚洲邻国打交道时日益采用宣传、颠复、“人民外交”、和政治阴谋手段，情况就更是如此了。北平企图以这种办法来获得它显然是不敢尝试通过军事征服来获得的东西。因此美国认为，在保卫亚洲的和平和安全时，对颠复的威胁保持警惕是同对公开的军事进攻的威胁保持警惕同样重要的。
    为了制止北平在亚洲扩大共产党统治的企图，拒绝给予外交承认是一个重要因素。在通常情况下，一个大国给予外交承认不仅使对方有更多机会参加国际会议而且还提高了对方的国际地位和威望。另一方面，拒绝给予承认是有关的政权的一个肯定的障碍，这种障碍使它相应地更加难于成功地奉行它的外交政策。美国不承认共产党中国的一个基本目的是要使它得不到这种好处，从而相应地限制它威胁这个地区的安全的能力。
    扶持蒋帮政治僵尸  阴谋长期霸占台湾
    就中国而言，有一些特别的考虑影响美国关于承认问题的政策。首先是，虽然中国共产党人已经夺取了中国的绝大部分，但是他们还没有完全征服那个国家。被普遍承认的合法的中国政府还继续存在，并且在台湾稳步地发展它的政治、经济和军事的力量。中华民国政府控制着战略性的岛屿台湾，由于它拥有一支庞大的军队——自由世界方面在亚洲最庞大的军事力量之一——对于中共的重新进行侵略是一种重大的威慑力量。美国承认共产党中国就会严重地挫伤那个政府，如果不是完全毁了它的话。另一方面，美国继续承认和支持中华民国就使它能够反对中国共产党人自称代表中国人民的说法，并且使那些决心最后把他们的国家从共产党的统治下面解放出来的中国人继续怀抱希望。
    美国承认共产党中国对于亚洲的其他自由政府将会发生不良的影响，给自由世界在世界那一地区的事业带来不堪设想的后果。那些同美国结成紧密联盟并力图在中共势力的周围维护自己独立的国家，特别是朝鲜和越南，将会感到极大的迷惑和沮丧，它们会把这种行动解释为美国放弃它们的事业。它们可能由此推论：它们生存的唯一希望在于采取挺而走险的措施，不管这些措施会不会危害那个地区和世界的和平。离开中国边境更远的政府会把美国承认共产党中国看作是美国从远东撤退的第一步。没有美国的支持，它们就不能长久抵抗北平的意志；某些国家大概还会得出结论，认为它们最明智的办法就是迅速取得可能从北平那里得到的最好条件。不用说这种发展会使整个自由世界在亚洲的地位处于最严重的险境。
    害怕华侨心向祖国  更怕我国进联合国
    另一个有关中国的特别考虑就是在东南亚的大部分国家中存在着庞大的和有势力的“海外”华侨。
    美国在决定对华政策的过程中，考虑过主张给予北平外交承认的那些人所提出来的各种说法和论点。提得最多的承认中国的理由之一是：现实必须予以“承认”；六亿人民不能予以“忽视”。这两种说法表面很动听，然而实际上它们自己忽视了这个局势的现实。当然，美国政策的根据是对中国共产党政权目前控制着大陆中国这一事实的充分了解。然而，为了和一个政权打交道，并不一定要同它建立外交关系。美国没有在外交上承认共产党中国，可是它还是在朝鲜和印度支那停战谈判中，以及较近时期在日内瓦大使会谈中，同中国共产党的代表进行了长期的谈判。同样，美国的政策决没有“忽视”中国人民的存在和愿望。它对中国人民的态度还是那种传统的态度：友好和同情的谅解。尽管如此，很明显，决不能让我们对中国人民的友谊使我们看不到中国共产党政权现在对我们的安全的威胁。此外，美国深信，中国共产党政权并不代表中国人民真正的意志或愿望，因而我们不承认中国共产党政权的政策在实际上是符合他们最终利益的。
    如果这些侨民受中国共产党人的支配的话，这些国家建立健全的自由社会和发展它们的经济的努力将会受到严重阻碍；共产党通过这些侨民进行颠复活动的严重威胁将会产生。如果美国承认共产党中国，从而不可避免地使美国的地位下降和使中华民国的地位下降，这将会对华侨产生极其深刻的心理影响，以致这必然会使大批华侨转而对共产党方面忠诚。这转而会破坏东道国抵抗有助于促进中国共产党权势的扩张的压力的能力。
    在中国问题上必需考虑的另一个因素是承认共产党政权对联合国所产生的影响。如果美国承认北平，这就必然导致北平派代表参加这个组织。美国认为，这将损害——如果不是破坏的话——作为维护国际和平的工具的联合国。朝鲜战争是联合国通过集体行动制止侵略的第一次最重要的努力。共产党中国是联合国对之采取行动的一方，如果在它仍然没有洗清它的侵略罪名和无视联合国在朝鲜的意志的情况下让它参加联合国，这将等于承认联合国失败，因而会大大减少联合国今后所采取的反对侵略的行动的成功可能性。况且，中华民国是联合国的一个名声极好的创建国，它在那里的代表对这个组织的建设性工作作出了重要的贡献。如果中国共产党政权的代表取代他们在联合国的席位，并且得到中国在安全理事会中的否决权，这个组织今后履行它根据宪章所承担的维护国际和平和安全的责任的能力将会受到严重损害。
    坚持敌视中国政策  图谋扩大侵略远东
    主张承认中共的人们常常认为，根据适用于这类情况的国际法的标准，北平政权“有权得到外交承认”。在美国看来，获得外交承认是一种特权，而不是一种权利。此外，美国认为，外交承认是一种执行国家政策的工具，使用这种工具来维护我国自己的高尚利益，既是我国的权利，也是我国的义务。然而，即使按照国际法中常常引证的标准来看，中共政权是不是有资格获得外交承认，是有理由加以怀疑的。中共政权并未统治中国全国，有一个巨大力量存在，这个力量否认它统治中国全国的说法。紧紧控制着大陆中国的中国共产党是一个极少数，不到中国人民的2％，作为它的统治的特征的强制组织化、残暴镇压和强迫牺牲，已经引起人民的广泛骚动。引用托马斯·杰斐逊的名言来说，这个政权肯定并不代表“老百姓的充分宣布的意志”。最后，它并未表示打算履行它所承担的国际义务。它最初采取的行动之一是废除中华民国所缔结的条约，它愿意延续的那些条约除外。它刚一执政，就实际无偿地没收了外国国民的财产，其中包括巨大的英国投资，尽管联合王国很快地就承认了它。它未能履行在那以后承担的各种义务，其中包括朝鲜停战协定和关于越南和老挝问题的日内瓦协定的各种规定，以及1955年9月发表的“协议声明”，在这个声明中，它保证使中国境内的一切美国人得以“迅速”回国。
    因此，美国对于承认共产党中国问题的政策的依据是对于国家利益的经过慎重考虑后作出的判断。不承认北平，同时继续承认和支持中华民国，这就便于美国达到在远东的政策目标。承认北平就会严重地妨碍达到这些目标，并且将有助于共产党力量在亚洲的发展。
    中苏团结牢不可破  无隙可乘徒自悲哀
    有时有人说，承认共产党中国就可能对北平政权行使杠杆作用，最后可能成功地削弱或甚至打破北平同莫斯科的联系。不幸，并没有迹象支持这种信念，而且有一些重要的理由说明为什么这是不可能的。莫斯科和北平之间的联盟是由来已久的；早在中国共产党1921年成立时它们就建立了联盟，当时共产国际的代表在中国共产党中起着重要的作用。
    这是以共同的观念形态和双方对非共产党世界所抱有的共同目标为基础的。最近的一切迹象都表明中国共产党人同苏联之间的联系非常密切而不是相反。中国共产党公开地拥护苏联对匈牙利的武装干涉，而且无保留地赞成处死纳吉和匈牙利暴动中的其他领袖。在共产党集团最近由于南斯拉夫企图摆脱克里姆林控制，奉行民族政策而对它发动攻击的时候，中国共产党也是带头人。这些事实和其他事实表明中苏联盟中的两个伙伴清楚地认识到它们的相互依靠性而且非常重视这个集团在自由世界面前的团结。
    而且，同苏联联盟对于中国共产党人来说有着特别重要的意义，因为它是武器和军事供应品的可靠来源。中国共产党领袖，包括毛泽东本人在内，是通过掌握军事力量而上台的。因此他们清楚地认识到军事力量对于他们不顾国内外反对保持政权并实现他们的外交政策目标的重要性。很难相信他们敢于冒险采取任何可能使他们失去军事供应来源的行动。仅仅从这一原因来看，认为美国或其他主要大国承认北平就会诱使中国共产党人扮演一个“铁托主义的”角色，似乎也是不现实的。
    事实上，结果十分可能恰恰相反。如果美国在外交上承认北平——并且带来由于提高它的国际威望而造成的一切影响——北平的领袖们非常可能会更加相信他们的政策是正确的，同莫斯科继续密切合作是有好处的。
    常常有人说，承认共产党中国是同那个国家扩大贸易关系的一个必要的步骤。对美国来说，这当然不是一种考虑的因素，因为由于朝鲜战争的结果，美国根据资敌治罪法对北平实行了禁运。但是，甚至对的确希望同大陆中国扩大贸易的国家来说，事实也不能证明贸易取决于承认的论点。恰恰相反，在1950年承认共产党中国的英国发现它从共产党中国购进的货物比共产党中国向它购买的更多。另一方面，西德并没有承认北平，可是在对大陆中国的贸易方面却有顺差。无论如何，同共产党中国贸易的机会受到缺乏外汇的情况的严重限制，这种情况可能还要继续许多年。而且，这种贸易永远要受共产党的政策的支配。只要北平认为有利，它就会利用贸易作为对贸易的对方施加压力的手段。一个突出的例子就是日本；最近，由于日本在政治上拒绝作出某些让步，中国共产党就断绝了一切贸易，甚至取消了已经缔结的合同来进行报复。因此，看来同北平贸易的好处最后终将证明只是暂时的，而不是实际存在的。
    “两个中国”阴谋难逞  妄想颠复我国政权
    一个时常听到的论点是，中国共产党人是“木已成舟”，他们迟早终归会得到承认，现在服从这种必然性比后来不体面地被迫这样作要明智一些。是的，没有理由认为中国共产党政权是处在崩溃的边缘，但是，也同样没有理由相信它目前在大陆中国的统治是永久的。事实上，在过去一年所进行的“思想改造”以及群众性的反“右派”分子运动已经显示在共产党中国存在着不满和不安的明显迹象。由于独裁统治镇压和窒息了一切反对，它就造成一种它们的统治的持久性的假象，中国共产党的统治也不是这个规律的一个例外。美国认为，共产主义在中国的统治不是永久性的，它有朝一日总会消失的。它想通过不给北平外交上承认的作法，来加速这种消失的过程。
    在公开讨论对华政策的时候，有一个引起了极其广泛注意的建议是叫做“两个中国方案”的建议。简单地说，主张这种解决办法的人建议承认中共政权是大陆中国的政府，而在台北的政府仍然是台湾的合法政府。他们提出理由说，对中国问题加以这样处理，优点在于只是把共产党人已经控制的东西给予他们，却为自由世界保存住台湾这个具有军事战略价值的堡垒。但是，这个方案忽视了或者说没有理会某些具有根本重要意义的事实。中华民国不会同意把它对于中国的主权加以任何削减，可以料想它会竭尽一切可能来反对这样一种解决办法。如果违反它的意愿而强制实行“两个中国方案”，那个政府作为自由世界事业的忠实盟友的效能将被毁坏。北平也会拒绝这样的一种解决办法。事实上，过去一年间，中国共产党的宣传屡次努力谴责“两个中国”的主张，而且说来具有讽刺意味的是，它一直在指责美国政府试图实行这个方案。对于最后取得台湾，北平十分重视，并且不断声言保留在其他办法失败时以武力夺取台湾的它所谓的“权利”。它永不会同意任何会使台湾永久脱离中国的解决办法。
    北平和台北都激烈反对“两个中国”的主张。因此，即使可以由外界的机构强行实施这样的一种办法，它也不是一种稳定的解决办法。那时就需要不断地进行监察来防止这一方或者那一方以暴力推翻这种局面。
    叫喊坚持死硬政策  企图阻挡舆论压力
    有时候有人说，不承认北平只会把中国共产党人变成殉难者，使他们能够把自己装扮成无辜的和受害的一方、特别是在亚洲的中立主义国家面前。不能否认，这里有些情况确是如此。但是采取相反的方针所造成的害处远远超过了这种害处。很显然，宁可让某些不是不能够就是不愿意了解中共政策里所带有的威胁的中立国家错误地认为北平受到不公平的待遇，也不能让美国在亚洲的盟国——它们处于防止中共扩张的第一条防线——由于在它们看来只能是违反常识的一项措施而困惑和沮丧。
    四十五个非共产主义国家承认中华民国。只有十九个非共产主义国家承认了北平，而其中大多数还是在1950年朝鲜战争以前就承认了的。因此人们会把自由世界一个主要国家的承认解释成为中国共产党人的一个重大胜利，解释为自由世界不愿意抵抗共产党压力的一个迹象，解释为自由世界内部在如何对付国际共产主义扩张势力的问题上存在着严重意见分歧的一个极其有害的证明。这个行动在远东会有特别严重的影响。在那里，直接暴露在中共扩张主义压力之下的自由世界国家会感到失望和困惑，而某些国家，由于害怕在共产党势力面前陷于孤立，毫无疑问会情不自禁地仿效别国的榜样。而在世界其他地区的国家也可能仿效这样树立的先例，因为这些国家的政府对于远东形势的严重性质是不那么明确的，它们所受到的那个地区形势发展的影响也不那么直接。其他自由国家承认中共政权的不可避免的结果会是大大地提高它的声誉、影响和力量，并使得维护自由世界在太平洋地区的安全利益的努力更加困难。
