　　Joy from the Sky
    In ancient China, there were many legends about dragons, and the legends of dragons were often related to rain. Old people said that the bald-tailed dragon was extremely good to the people. Whenever the people needed rain, the bald-tailed dragon would immediately make it rain. Therefore, the people loved it. However, no one at that time had ever really seen this dragon.
    Recently, in Lafa and Jinbu townships in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, people saw an airplane fly by, and the white clouds in the sky immediately turned into dark clouds, and it rained in an instant. This was truly joy from the sky! The farmers spread the word, calling it a miracle. Could it be that the bald-tailed dragon really descended from the sky? It turned out to be artificial rainfall.
    Our working people have long yearned for rain to fall according to people's needs, but in the past, it was impossible to do so even if they waited eagerly. Now that our "Oriental Red Dragon" has the ability to move mountains and seas, it naturally has the ability to call the wind and summon the rain, and the ideal of artificial rainfall will inevitably become a reality.

　　喜从天降
    在中国古代，有许许多多关于龙的传说，而龙的传说往往同雨有关系。老人们说秃尾巴龙对人民好极了，人民什么时候要雨，秃尾巴龙就会立刻行雨。所以，人民喜爱它。然而，那时谁也没有真正看到过这条龙。
    最近，在吉林省蛟河县拉法、进步等乡，人们看到一架飞机一掠而过，天空的白云立时变成乌云，霎时间下起雨来。这真是喜从天降！农民们奔走相告，说是奇迹。莫非秃尾巴龙真的从天而降？原来这是人工降雨。
    我国劳动人民早就渴望按照人们的需要而下雨，然而，在过去，即使望穿秋水也不可能办到。现在，我们“东方红龙”既有移山造海的能耐，自然就有呼风唤雨的本领，人工降雨的理想，就必然能够成为现实。
