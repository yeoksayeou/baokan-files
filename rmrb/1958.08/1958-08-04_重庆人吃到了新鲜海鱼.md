    Chongqing Residents Enjoy Fresh Seafood

    Recently, even during the scorching summer heat, the people of Chongqing have been able to buy fresh yellow croaker, ribbonfish, cuttlefish, and Chinese herring, all abundant in the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, from the market. It is the first time in history that large quantities of fresh seafood have been transported and sold in the Chongqing market.

    Many Chongqing residents regard being able to taste such fresh and delicious seafood as a happy event. All of the more than 120 households in the Xinsheng Market bought yellow croaker and cuttlefish. Feng Fangzhu, a resident of Zhejiang who moved to Chongqing 22 years ago, bought yellow croaker and cuttlefish four times in a row for her family. Days later, when others talked about it, she still said with great relish that it was the first time her family had eaten yellow croaker in more than 20 years since coming to Chongqing. Many customers praised the spirit of the Food and Animal Products Company staff in serving the people. The first batch of 100,000 jin of yellow croaker, ribbonfish, and cuttlefish transported from Shanghai was snapped up in three days, and the sales volume increased by more than two times compared with the usual sales of fresh fish.

    It is indeed not easy for the people of Chongqing to eat fresh seafood. This batch of seafood was specially supplied to the people of Chongqing by the staff of the Shanghai Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company from their local supply. The seafood was transported by refrigerated train through several railways, including Longhai, Baoji-Chengdu, and Chengdu-Chongqing. Before liberation, it cost 1.6 yuan (converted to the current price) to buy even a pound of stinky yellow croaker in Chongqing. Now, each pound of yellow croaker costs only 4 jiao, and the general working people can also taste it. (Attached picture)

### 重庆人吃到了新鲜海鱼

    重庆人吃到了新鲜海鱼
    最近，重庆人民在酷热的盛暑，也能从市场上买到江、浙沿海盛产的新鲜黄鱼、带鱼、墨鱼和刀鱼。大批新鲜海产品运销重庆市场是历史上第一次。
    许多重庆人把能尝到这样新鲜味美的海产品当成一桩喜事。新生市场的一百二十多户居民，家家买了黄鱼和墨鱼。二十二年前就迁住重庆的浙江籍居民冯方珠全家，一连买了四次黄鱼和墨鱼吃。几天后当别人谈起这件事，她还津津有味地说，她全家来重庆二十多年中这是第一次吃上黄鱼。许多顾客表扬了食品畜产公司职工为群众服务的精神。第一批从上海运来的十万斤黄鱼、带鱼和墨鱼，在三天内被争购一空，销售量比平日鲜鱼销量增加两倍多。
    重庆人民吃到新鲜海产品，确是不容易的事。这批海产品是上海水产供销公司职工从当地供应量中调剂出来专门供应重庆人民尝味的。海产品坐上了冷藏火车辗转经过陇海、宝成、成渝等多条铁路运来的。解放前，在重庆连买一斤发臭的黄鱼，也要一元六角（折合现在的价）。现在每斤黄鱼只四角多钱，一般劳动人民也可尝味了。（附图片）
