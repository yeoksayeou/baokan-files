	Newly Reopened Railway
	The railway between Mishan and Hutou, which is 101 kilometers in length and had been dismantled for fourteen years, has now been fully restored and has begun temporary passenger and freight operations. Currently, this railway is continuing to be built towards the farms in the Great Northern Wilderness. In the future, the means of production and daily necessities needed by the farms, as well as the grain produced, can be transported by train. (Wang Zhao)

    刚修通的铁路
    拆除十四年之久，全长一百零一公里的密山至虎头间的铁路，现已全线修复，开始办理临时客货营业。目前这段铁路正继续向北大荒的农场修筑。今后各农场所需要的生产资料、生活用品和生产出来的粮食，就可以通过火车运输。  （王沼）
