Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: The First National Quyi Performance Conference concluded in Beijing on the 14th.

　　This performance conference was a gathering of "heroes" and also a leap forward conference. More than 300 representatives of Quyi circles from all over the country gathered in Beijing to review the achievements of their great leap forward in politics, ideology, and art. A total of 167 programs selected from various places were performed. In the 95 performances over 11 days, the audience reached 110,000, reflecting that Quyi is more diverse and popular than any other drama. Among these programs, 76% were Quyi programs reflecting real life that emerged during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last winter and this spring. They quickly reflected the new era and played the vanguard role of Quyi. Many programs have also made many new creations and reforms in singing art and musical accompaniment. During the performance conference, representatives from various places exchanged experiences, and actors and teachers and students from many professional art groups and art colleges launched a heat wave of learning from Quyi actors and Qin players. All the representatives showed a high degree of political enthusiasm and revolutionary vigor, and many representatives formulated leap forward plans for putting politics in command, becoming both red and expert themselves, and going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, said in a summary report that this grand performance conference was unprecedented in the history of our country, and it shows that our country's Quyi has developed to a new historical period. This performance conference and the upcoming National Quyi Work Conference and Quyi Workers Congress will more comprehensively push the art of Quyi to a new stage of development.

　　Liu Zhiming pointed out that an important sign of the new stage of Quyi development is the great leap forward in Quyi creation in recent years in terms of politics, ideology, and art. There are many excellent modern Quyi programs in this performance conference, such as "Five Thousand One," "The Dragon King Resigns," "Lost Record," "Turning Over Record," "Scout," "The East Wind Absolutely Overwhelms the West Wind," and traditional Quyi programs such as "Wu Song Fights the Tiger" and "Uproar in Jiangzhou," which have reached a very high level in politics and art. Most of the programs in this performance conference can be widely promoted. What is particularly valuable is that these modern Quyi programs truly reflect the communist spirit of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Great Leap Forward, and show their heroic spirit of breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, boldly creating, and fantasizing about the future, so that they can combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in literary and artistic creation. Liu Zhiming also pointed out that modern Quyi programs should become the mainstream of Quyi programs, but it is still necessary to carefully organize and develop traditional Quyi programs and inherit and develop traditional singing techniques.

　　Liu Zhiming said that this performance conference shows that as long as Quyi workers put politics in command, go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and work hard to transform themselves, they can achieve greater achievements in serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. He called on all representatives to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to move forward, be revolutionaries in politics and reformers in art, play the role of Quyi's "vanguard" and "light cavalry," and better serve politics, workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　Lao She, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, expressed warm congratulations on the success of this performance conference in his speech. He believes that this performance conference plays a role in promoting the leap forward of the entire literary and art circles.

　　The delegations from various places attending this performance conference also issued a letter of proposal, calling on Quyi workers across the country to plant red flags, pull out white flags, and strive to be both red and expert; perform the central task, sing the central task, and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be the vanguard of political propaganda.

　　做政治宣传的尖兵！
　　曲艺会演代表提出倡议
    新华社14日讯　第一届全国曲艺会演大会14日在北京闭幕。
    这次会演是一次“群英会”，也是一次跃进会，曲艺界的三百多名代表人物从全国各地齐集北京，检阅了他们政治上、思想上、艺术上大跃进的成果。这次总共演出了各地精选出来的一百六十七个节目，在十一天的九十五场演出中，观众达到十一万人次，体现出曲艺比任何剧种都更为丰富多采，受到观众的欢迎。这些节目中有76％是在去冬今春工农业生产大跃进中产生的反映现实生活的曲目，它们迅速反映了新的时代面貌，发挥了曲艺所起的尖兵作用。许多曲目在演唱艺术和音乐伴奏上也有许多新的创造和改革。在会演期间，各地代表们交流了经验，许多专业艺术团体、艺术院校的演员和师生展开了向曲艺演员和琴师们学习的热潮。全体代表显示了高度的政治热情和革命干劲，很多代表订出了政治挂帅、自己又红又专、深入工农兵的跃进规划。
    文化部副部长刘芝明在总结报告中说，这次盛大的会演在我国历史上是空前的，它表明我国的曲艺已经发展到新的历史时期。这次会演和即将举行的全国曲艺工作会议以及曲艺工作者代表大会将更加全面地把曲艺艺术推向一个新的发展阶段。
    刘芝明指出，曲艺发展到新阶段的一个重要标志，就是近年来曲艺创作在政治上、思想上、艺术上的大跃进。这次会演中有许多优秀的现代曲目，例如“五千一”、“龙王辞职”、“迷路记”、“翻身记”、“侦察兵”、“东风绝对压倒西风”和传统曲目“武松打虎”、“闹江州”等在政治上艺术上都已经达到很高的水平。这次会演中的绝大部分节目都可以普遍推广。特别值得珍视的是，这些现代曲目真实地反映了大跃进中工农兵群众的共产主义精神面貌，表现了他们破除迷信、思想解放、大胆创造、幻想未来的英雄气概，因而能够在文艺创作上使革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义结合起来。刘芝明还指出，现代曲目应当成为曲艺曲目的主流，但仍然要认真整理和发展传统曲目，继承与发展传统演唱技巧。
    刘芝明说，这次会演表明，曲艺工作者只要政治挂帅，深入工农兵生活，努力改造自己，就能在为工农兵服务方面取得更大的成就。他号召全体代表戒骄戒躁，不断前进，做政治上的革命派和艺术上的革新派，发挥曲艺的“尖兵”和“轻骑兵”的作用，更好地为政治、为工农兵服务。
    中国作家协会副主席老舍在讲话中，对这次会演的成功表示热情的祝贺。他认为这次会演对整个文艺界的跃进起着推动的作用。
    出席这次会演的各地代表团还发出了一份倡议书，号召全国曲艺工作者插红旗、拔白旗，力争红透专深；演中心、唱中心，更好地为工农兵服务，做政治宣传的尖兵。（附图片）
