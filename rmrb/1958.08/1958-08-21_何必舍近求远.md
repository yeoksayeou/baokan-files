　　Why Bother Going Far Afield?
　　In May of this year, the purchasing agent of the Mengzi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yunnan Province traveled a thousand miles to Liuzhou City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and bought three horse-drawn wooden carts and a wooden peanut planter. These four pieces of farm equipment were shipped to Pingxiang, where they were backlogged for a long time due to the large volume of freight.
　　In fact, the construction of these two kinds of agricultural implements is very simple, and they can be manufactured by organizing local carpenters. The Mengzi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative went so far to buy them, isn't this abandoning the near to seek the far, and creating waste for themselves?

　　何必舍近求远
    今年5月，云南省蒙自县供销社派采购员，不远千里到广西僮族自治区柳州市买了三辆马拉小木车和一架木制花生播种机。这四件农具运到凭祥以后，因为这里货运量大，积压很久。
    其实，这两种农具的构造都很简单，在当地组织木工制造就可以。蒙自县供销社却跑那末远去购买，这岂不是舍近求远，自找浪费吗？
