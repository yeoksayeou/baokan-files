Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Second (Enlarged) Session of the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was held in Beijing on August 6th.

　　In accordance with the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the meeting discussed and formulated the guidelines and tasks for the future work of trade unions nationwide, and studied and formulated several important measures to improve and strengthen trade union work.

　　The meeting unanimously elected Comrade Liu Ningyi as Chairman of the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and additionally elected Comrade Li Jiebo as Vice Chairman and Secretary of the Secretariat.

　　Prior to this Executive Committee meeting, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened a rectification meeting with the participation of responsible comrades from trade unions in various provinces and cities, industrial trade unions, some special district trade union offices, county trade unions, and large grassroots trade unions. This rectification meeting conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, reviewed and summarized the work of trade unions nationwide in recent years, thoroughly exposed and struggled against the crimes of the right-wing elements who had infiltrated the trade union, the former Workers' Daily Director Chen Yongwen, against the Party, against the people, and against socialism, thoroughly examined the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and achieved a complete victory.

　　The Executive Committee meeting listened to the report of Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on the rectification work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Before the conclusion of the meeting, Comrade Liu Ningyi spoke on issues such as continuing to implement the spirit of rectification in the future trade union work, strengthening the revolutionary nature of the trade union, and that the trade union can only do its work well under the complete leadership of the Party. The meeting unanimously believed that the problems solved and the victories achieved in this rectification meeting of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have profound educational significance for all trade union workers nationwide and have extremely important effects on improving future trade union work.

　　The meeting unanimously condemned the right-wing element Chen Yongwen as a thorough revisionist who had infiltrated the ranks of the revolution. For many years, he had been using the position given to him by the Party to engage in anti-Party and anti-people activities. He used the Workers' Daily to disseminate a large amount of revisionist poison, slander the Party, attack the Party, and vilify the Party, attempting to stir up trouble and create chaos in our country in order to realize his despicable political ambitions.

　　The meeting also exposed and criticized the erroneous thinking of some trade union leaders who were vying for power from the Party and the government, worshiping the spontaneous movement of workers, and tampering with the Party's policy on the workers' movement.

　　In his speech, Comrade Liu Ningyi emphasized that the most fundamental truth that all trade union cadres must firmly remember is that the trade union organization must unconditionally accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no socialism, and there would be no genuine workers' movement. The trade union should be a mass organization of the working class with a clear revolutionary character. Trade union organizations must work under the unified leadership and unified deployment of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels, strengthen communist ideological education for the broad masses of employees, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and transform the Party's line, principles, and policies into the conscious actions of the masses. All business work of the trade union must be closely combined with political tasks and serve the Party's political tasks. All communists working in the trade union must unconditionally abide by the Party's democratic centralism, maintain the Party's unity, and absolutely not allow setting up one's own shop, forming one's own system, acting in a deceptive manner, making innovations, or creating independence from the Party. They must dare to adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, and take adhering to Marxist-Leninist principles and maintaining the Party's unity as the criteria for guiding their words and actions.

　　Comrade Liu Ningyi also pointed out in his speech that due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the provincial and municipal Party committees, the achievements of the national trade union work are primary, and the mistakes are secondary. The correct line is the mainstream, and the erroneous line is the tributary. However, trade union cadres must deeply realize that in the cause of socialism and communism, bourgeois individualism is the source of all evil. Individualism is the great enemy of communism. Without destroying individualism, we cannot establish communism.

　　In accordance with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the meeting formulated the guidelines and tasks for the future work of the trade unions nationwide, which is to further unite and educate the broad masses of employees under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and local Party committees at all levels, and to fight for the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction.

　　The meeting pointed out that in the future, trade union organizations at all levels must adhere to the Party Central Committee's policy of giving prominence to politics, taking the development of production as the center, and gradually improving the material and cultural lives of employees on the basis of developing production, continue to carry forward the communist noble qualities of the broad masses of employees of being selfless, working selflessly, and not caring about personal treatment, and at the same time, constantly care for the material and cultural lives of employees, solve problems that should and can be solved, and guide employees to actively build socialism.

　　The meeting believes that continuously strengthening communist education for employees is of great significance. The meeting called on trade union organizations at all levels to correctly treat the contradiction between the advanced and backward in the workers' ranks, and with veteran workers and advanced workers as the core, to earnestly carry out ideological transformation work in the workers' ranks, and to constantly fight against bourgeois ideology and various non-proletarian ideologies, so as to maintain and consolidate the purity of the working class and make the trade union truly become a communist school for the broad masses of employees. The trade union must also attach great importance to consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, educate employees to proceed from the 600 million people, vigorously support agricultural production, and help the development of industry in counties, towns, townships, and communes. The meeting also particularly emphasized the need to educate employees to exemplarily implement the government's policies and laws, so that the trade union truly becomes a strong social pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　In order to further improve trade union work, the meeting decided that trade union organizations at all levels should change their systems, delegate powers, streamline institutions, greatly reduce full-time cadres, and revise all rules and regulations that are detrimental to production, hinder work, and hinder the unity of the masses.

　　The meeting unanimously adopted two resolutions, one on the system of trade unions and the other on changing the management of labor insurance and collective labor insurance undertakings.

　　The meeting unanimously resolved to remove Dong Xin from his positions as member of the Presidium and Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, remove Wang Rong from his position as member of the Presidium, and unanimously resolved to expel the right-wing element, former Workers' Daily Director Chen Yongwen, from his positions as member of the Executive Committee and member of the Presidium, and to expel the right-wing element, former Hebei Provincial Trade Union Chairman Du Cunxun, from his position as member of the Executive Committee.

　　The meeting believes that through this rectification meeting of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the work has been examined, and the experiences and lessons have been summarized. The meeting believes that trade union work is glorious, and that future trade union work will not be more difficult to do, but easier to do, not without anything to do, but with a lot to do. The meeting called on trade union organizations at all levels to conscientiously convey and implement the spirit of the rectification meeting and the Executive Committee meeting of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels. According to the specific situation, continue to carry out rectification movements in trade union organizations in order to eliminate various erroneous tendencies in trade union work.

　　The meeting finally called on every trade union worker to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, constantly improve their political and ideological level and policy and theoretical level, improve their ability to distinguish between right and wrong, resolutely implement and implement the Party's policy on the workers' movement, thoroughly crush the capitulationist right-leaning opportunism that tampered with the Party's policy on the workers' movement, and overcome the tendency of dogmatism that is divorced from reality and mechanically imitates. In trade union work, we must conscientiously implement the mass line of work methods. All trade union cadres must appear as ordinary workers, work and share hardships with the masses, and constantly overcome bureaucracy. Every trade union worker must conscientiously transform their thinking, constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism, promote proletarian ideology, eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish a communist worldview, and honestly serve the socialist and communist cause of the working class.

　　讨论和确定了今后工会工作的方针和任务
    新华社11日讯　中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会第二次会议（扩大）8月6日在北京举行。
    会议根据党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，讨论和拟订了今后全国工会工作的方针和任务，研究和制订了改进与加强工会工作的若干重要措施。
    会议一致选举刘宁一同志为中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会主席，增选了李颉伯同志为副主席兼书记处书记。
    在这次执委会举行之前，在党中央的直接领导下，全国总工会召开了有各省市、各产业工会和部分专区工会办事处、县工会及大基层工会负责同志参加的整风会议。这次整风会议认真贯彻执行了党的八大二次会议的精神，检查和总结了全国几年来的工会工作，彻底揭露和斗争了混入工会内部的右派分子、前工人日报社长陈用文的反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪行，彻底检查了全国总工会的工作，并且获得了彻底的胜利。
    执委会议听取了全国总工会副主席刘长胜关于全国总工会整风工作的报告，会议结束前刘宁一同志就今后工会继续贯彻整风精神，加强工会的革命性和工会要完全在党的领导之下才能做好工作等问题讲了话。会议一致认为，这次全国总工会的整风会议所解决的问题和取得的胜利，对全国所有的工会工作者都有着深刻的教育意义，对改进今后的工会工作具有极其重大的作用。
    会议一致谴责右派分子陈用文是一个混入革命队伍内部的彻头彻尾的修正主义者。多年来，他利用党给他的职务，一直进行反党、反人民的活动。他利用工人日报大量地散布修正主义的毒素，污蔑党、攻击党、丑化党，企图在我国煽风点火、制造混乱，以实现其卑鄙的政治野心。
    会议还揭发和批判了某些工会领导干部向党向政府争夺权力，崇拜工人自发运动，篡改党的工运方针的错误思想。
    刘宁一同志在讲话中强调指出：全体工会干部必须牢牢记住的一条最根本的真理，就是工会组织必须无条件地接受共产党的领导。离开了党的领导，就没有社会主义，就没有真正的工人运动。工会应该是具有鲜明的革命性的工人阶级群众组织。工会组织必须在党中央和各级党委统一领导和统一部署下进行工作，加强对职工群众的共产主义思想教育，兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想，把党的路线、方针、政策变成群众的自觉行动。工会各项的业务工作都要紧密同政治任务相结合，为党的政治任务服务。一切在工会工作中的共产党员都必须无条件地遵守党的民主集中制，维护党的团结统一，绝不允许自立门户，自成系统、阳奉阴违、标新立异，向党闹独立，要勇于坚持真理，改正错误，把坚持马列主义原则和维护党的团结统一作为指导自己言论和行动的准则。
    刘宁一同志在讲话中还指出由于党中央和省、市党委的正确领导，全国工会工作成绩是主要的，错误是次要的。正确路线是主流，错误路线是支流。但工会干部必须深刻认识到在社会主义和共产主义事业中，资产阶级个人主义是万恶之源。个人主义是共产主义的大敌，不破个人主义，就不能立共产主义。
    会议根据党的社会主义建设的总路线的精神，拟订了今后全国工会工作的方针任务，就是在党中央和地方各级党委的统一领导下。进一步团结和教育广大职工群众，为贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线而斗争。
    会议指出，各级工会组织今后必须坚持党中央关于政治挂帅，以发展生产为中心、并在发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工群众的物质和文化生活的方针，继续发扬广大职工群众的大公无私、忘我劳动、不计个人待遇的共产主义的高尚品质，同时也要不断地关怀职工群众的物质和文化生活，解决应该而又可能解决的问题，引导职工群众积极建设社会主义。
    会议认为，不断地加强对职工的共产主义教育，有着十分重要的意义。会议要求各级工会组织正确对待工人队伍中的先进和落后的矛盾，并以老工人和先进工人为核心，切实进行工人队伍中的思想改造工作，经常地向资产阶级思想和各种非无产阶级思想作斗争，以保持和巩固工人阶级队伍的纯洁，使工会真正成为广大职工的共产主义学校。工会还必须十分重视巩固工农联盟的工作，教育职工从六亿人口出发，大力支援农业生产，帮助县、镇、乡、社工业的发展。会议还特别强调要教育职工群众模范地执行政府的政策法令，使工会真正成为人民民主专政的坚强社会支柱。
    为了进一步改进工会工作，会议确定各级工会组织改变体制，下放权力，精简机构，大量减少脱产干部，修改一切不利生产、妨碍工作和妨碍群众团结的规章制度。
    会议一致通过了两项决议，一项是关于工会体制的决议，另一项是关于改变劳动保险与集体劳动保险事业管理的决议。
    会议一致决议撤销董昕的全国总工会主席团委员和书记处书记的职务、撤销王榕的主席团委员的职务，并且一致决议开除右派分子、前工人日报社长陈用文的执行委员和主席团委员的职务、开除右派分子、前河北省工会主席杜存训的执行委员的职务。
    会议认为，经过这次全国总工会整风会议，检查了工作，总结了经验教训。会议认为，工会工作是光荣的，今后工会工作不是更难做，而是更好做，不是无事可做，而是大有可为。会议要求各级工会组织在各级党委的领导下，认真传达和贯彻全国总工会整风会议和执委会议的精神。根据具体情况，继续在工会组织中开展整风运动，以清除工会工作中的各种错误倾向。
    会议最后号召每一个工会工作者都必须认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，不断提高自己的政治思想水平和政策理论水平，提高识别是非的能力，坚决贯彻和执行党的工运方针，彻底粉碎篡改党的工运方针的投降资产阶级的右倾机会主义，克服脱离实际、生搬硬套的教条主义的倾向。在工会工作中必须认真贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法，一切工会干部都必须以普通劳动者的身份出现，和群众同劳动、共甘苦，不断克服官僚主义。每一个工会工作者都要认真改造思想，经常开展批评与自我批评，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，树立共产主义世界观，老老实实地为工人阶级的社会主义和共产主义事业服务。
