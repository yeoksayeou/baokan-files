Trembling Palace (International Vignette)
    Pei Hua

    Late at night, the British and American ambassadors to Jordan arrived at the palace together upon the invitation of King Hussein.

    "Your Majesty, what's the matter?" the British ambassador asked.

    Hussein was about to answer when the American ambassador patted him on the shoulder and exclaimed, "Oh my, child, what happened to you? Go look in the mirror!" The American ambassador was used to being informal.

    "Americans must be obeyed in every word." Hussein didn't dare to disobey this principle, so he had to step down from the throne. The throne was a wide, golden chair with the national emblem engraved on the back. Sitting on it wasn't comfortable. But Hussein had been sitting on it since dusk, refusing to leave, and when he got tired, he slid halfway down, reclining. He said to himself, "The throne is precarious, so I'll sit as long as I can. Let me sit enough!"

    But now he had to look in the mirror first. One look, aha, it was true, what a sight: clumps of hair standing up, a messy crow's nest. Oily sweat streamed down his black face, his eyes were bloodshot, and his protruding lips, covered by a few sparse, stiff whiskers, had lost their color. His beige suit was covered in cigarette ash and full of wrinkles; his handsome tie was loosely askew on his shoulder. His shoelaces were also untied.

    "To be honest, gentlemen ambassadors, I haven't eaten, drunk, or slept for two days and two nights in order to make a decision. I haven't had time to wash, bathe, or groom myself, please forgive me. The reason I've invited you tonight is to discuss this decision. I've decided... decided..." Here, Hussein stammered, and when he saw the ambassadors showing impatient expressions, he hurriedly continued: "I've decided... I think... I believe I should abdicate and take refuge abroad."

    The two ambassadors were greatly shocked, looked at each other, and didn't know what to say for a moment.

    "Humph, scared, wants to run for his life, what a coward!" The American ambassador finally spoke. When the American ambassador was anxious, he would say anything. He also shouted: "Good boy, sit back on the throne, America guarantees you won't lose your head."

    The British ambassador was more steady, and always maintained some "gentlemanly" demeanor even in awkward situations. He didn't say anything, but cursed in his heart, "Little bastard, so useless, the British Empire has raised you for nothing!" Then he thought, it's no wonder, this child has been suspicious, introverted, shy, and troubled since he was a child, and has no great ambitions. He only learned to be fashionable during his eighteen months of study in England, and was only interested in racing cars and jet planes. He was called back to the country at sixteen to ascend the throne, and he still ate, drank, and played, spending all day with women. When a crisis comes, such a character can't stand it. It seems that we have to slightly change our policies and methods for cultivating and educating such people in the future. Although this character has done a few big things in the last two years, such as getting rid of Glubb (the former British officer who served as Chief of Staff of the Jordanian Army) and his queen who was seven years older than him, which seems to make him more cunning and sensible, isn't he still being used and commanded as a puppet? The Americans are playing the most tricks in this, always grabbing ahead of us and leading him by the nose, how hateful!

    While the British ambassador was overwhelmed with emotions, he suddenly heard Hussein start to cry and make a fuss: "Uncle Ambassadors, please help me! I'm only twenty-three years old, and I don't want to end up like my grandfather, or my father, or my cousins so early!"

    The fact that the previous two generations of Jordanian kings were sacrifices of the Anglo-American rivalry was well known to all three. There was no need to elaborate among knowing people, and the three looked at each other, tacitly understanding.

    The American ambassador, fearing that the British ambassador would soften, quickly winked, and the two excused themselves to the restroom to meet. The American ambassador spoke into the British ambassador's ear: "This is not a joke, stabilize him, otherwise we will have even more trouble in the Middle East, it won't be easy to support another one, and there won't be enough time. Of course, it seems that his fate will not be better than his predecessors anyway. But this kid is trying to undermine us at this critical moment, he's really ungrateful, we must give him a hard time in the future, but we must stabilize him at this moment. You tell him some sweet talk, and I'll scold him." "Don't worry, old brother, on this point, we are of one mind." The two looked at each other and smiled, and for a moment, their suspicions seemed to dissipate.

    With a plan decided, the two returned, one playing the red face and the other the white face, one threatening with harsh words and the other comforting with kind words. After an hour of commotion, the three were exhausted and buried themselves deep in their chairs, desperately smoking, one cigarette after another. The continuous streams of thick smoke didn't have time to dissipate, converging into a large smoke net, covering all three, people and chairs.

    Finally, Hussein heard that as long as he survived this stage, he would be allowed to be the King of Iraq in the future, and he was both happy and doubtful. For him, being a king, even if he was a puppet, could still allow him to lord over the people, flaunt luxury, and be so comfortable! So he gritted his teeth and finally "agreed to the ambassadors that he would not take any steps in this regard until they had received the opinions of the US and British governments on this issue." However, he once again begged the United States to quickly send troops to "protect" him. The British ambassador did not express his attitude towards this request, but could not help but reveal a very contradictory and complex mood; the American ambassador casually agreed: "OK, no problem."

    Outside the window, Amman, the beautiful city composed of seven small hills—the capital of Jordan—was completely immersed in boundless darkness at this moment. But this is the darkness before dawn, and every household is eager to move, ready to get up, because it is almost dawn!

    战栗的宫廷（国际小品）
    裴化
    深夜，驻约旦的英、美大使奉国王侯赛因的邀请，相偕来到了宫廷。
    “国王陛下，出了什么事？”英国大使问。
    侯赛因正要回答，美国大使拍了他一记肩膀惊叫起来：“啊呀，孩子，你这是怎么了？快去照照镜子看！”美国大使是熟不拘礼惯了的。
    “美国人的话，应当句句听从。”侯赛因不敢违背这条原则，只得从宝座上走下来。这宝座是一把金黄色的宽大椅子，椅背上刻着个国徽。坐在上面并不舒服。但是侯赛因从黄昏开始就坐上去了，一直不肯离开，坐累了，就滑下半个身子来，斜躺着。他心里对自己说道：“王位岌岌可危了，现在能坐多久就坐多久吧，让我坐个够！”
    不过此刻必须先去照镜子。一照，啊哈，真是的，怎么这副模样：头发一撮撮竖着，乱蓬蓬地像个乌鸦窝。黑脸上淌着油汗，眼里满布红丝，覆盖在疏疏朗朗几根硬胡须下面那突起的嘴唇也失了血色。米色的西装沾满了烟灰，全是绉痕；漂亮领带宽松着歪在肩头。鞋带也散开了。
    “不瞒两位大使先生说，我为了作出一个决定，已经两天两夜不吃不喝不睡了，顾不上洗脸洗澡修饰，请原谅。今晚请你们来，就是要把这个决定谈一谈。我决定……决定……”谈到这里，侯赛因吞吐起来，待到一见大使们露出焦燥神色，便又慌忙说下去：“我决定……我想……我认为自己应该逊位，并且避居国外。”
    两个大使吃了一大惊，面面相觑，一时不知说什么才好。
    “哼，害怕了，要逃命了，真脓包！”美国大使终于开了腔。美国大使一急，是什么话都会说出来的。他还喝道：“乖乖儿坐到宝座上去吧，美国保证你不丢脑袋就是。”
    英国大使稳重些，再尴尬的情况下也总要保持几分“绅士”风。他没说什么，心里却骂道：“小兔崽子，这么不中用，大英帝国白养了你一场！”又一想，也难怪，这毛孩子小时候就多疑、内向、羞涩、苦恼，并无大志。在英国求学十八个月，只学会了赶时髦，只对赛汽车赛喷气飞机感兴趣。十六岁叫他回国登基，仍是吃吃玩玩，整天跟女人厮混。一到危急之秋，这样的脚色就顶不住了。看来我们以后培养教育这种人还得稍稍改变一下方针方法才是。这脚色虽然最近二年来做出了几件大事，如摆脱了格拉布（前担任约旦陆军参谋长的英国军官）和大他七岁的皇后，看起来仿佛狡猾懂事多了，其实还不都是受人利用，听人指挥的傀儡。这里面老美捣的鬼最多，总抢到我们前面去牵着他鼻子走，真可恨！
    英国大使正在百感交集的时候，忽听侯赛因带着哭音闹开了：“两位叔叔帮帮忙吧！我才二十三岁呢，不愿意这末早就落到祖父、或者父亲、或者堂兄弟一样的下场！”
    约旦前二代国王都是英、美角逐的牺牲品，这件事实三个人都了如指掌。明人不必细说，三人对看了一眼，也就心照不宣了。
    美国大使深恐英国大使软化，赶紧使了个眼色，两人先后告退到厕所汇合。美国大使就咬着英国大使耳朵说话：“这可不是闹着玩的，稳住他，不然我们在中东就更相加没办法了，再扶一个不容易，也来不及。当然，看来他的命运总也不会胜过他的前辈的。不过这小子在这个危急时候来拆台，未免太不识相了，将来一定给他苦头吃，此刻千万稳住他。你把甜头给他说说，我来训训他。”“放心，老兄，在这点上，我们可是心心相印的。”两人相视一笑，一时仿佛嫌疑尽释。
    计议已定，两人回进来就一个装红脸，一个装白脸，一个凶言威吓，一个好言劝慰。闹了一个时辰，三个人都疲倦了，各自深埋在椅子里，拼命抽着烟，一枝接一枝。不断吐出来的一股股浓烟来不及散开，汇成一张大烟网，把三个连人带椅都罩在里头。
    最后，侯赛因听得说只要度过这个阶段，将来还要让他兼伊拉克国王，不觉又喜又疑。对他说来，做国王，尽管是傀儡，毕竟可以向人民作威作福，煊赫豪华，多么舒服！他于是咬了咬牙根，终于“答应大使们在他们没有接到美、英两国政府对这个问题的意见时，他不在这方面采取任何步骤。”不过，他再一次恳求美国赶快派兵前来“保驾”。对于这个恳求，英国大使没有表示态度，但禁不住满面露出了一种非常矛盾复杂的心情来；美国大使则是不在意地就一口应承下来：“OK，没问题。”
    窗外，这座由七个小山组成的美丽城市安曼—约旦首都，此刻完全浸没在无边无际的黑暗之中。不过这是黎明前的黑暗，家家户户都跃跃欲动，准备起身，因为天快亮了！
