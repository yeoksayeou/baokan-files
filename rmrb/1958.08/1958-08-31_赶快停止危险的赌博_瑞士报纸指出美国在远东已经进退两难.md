Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 30th: Some Swiss newspapers, commenting on the United States' provocations against China in the Taiwan area, pointed out that the United States is very isolated and is in a dilemma.

	The "Tribune de Genève" published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent on the 29th, saying that if the United States further provokes, "it will risk launching a serious conflict in which it will not receive strong support from its allies, and even from a large part of the American people." The article said that some people in the United States are criticizing the government for engaging in this dangerous "gamble." However, the United States is afraid that stopping this provocation will lose "prestige" and "face."

	The newspaper published a commentary on the same day saying: "Eisenhower should consider the dangers of being isolated." It believes that the United States' provocations cannot expect the support of other Western countries.

	The "Swiss Newspaper" also published an editorial on the 27th, signed by Renault Bom, pointing out that in the actual situation where the status quo in China cannot be changed, the United States' continued support for Chiang Kai-shek puts it in an untenable position. After quoting the "Washington Post's" condemnation of the United States' provocative policy for putting itself in a dilemma, the newspaper pointed out that this policy is not even approved of by Americans. The newspaper also asserted that soon, the United States will become the only country that refuses to recognize the People's Republic of China and refuses to allow it to enter the United Nations.

　　赶快停止危险的赌博
    瑞士报纸指出美国在远东已经进退两难
    新华社30日讯　日内瓦消息：一些瑞士报纸在评论美国在台湾地区对中国挑衅时指出，美国很孤立，它已经处于进退两难的境地。
      “日内瓦论坛报”29日刊载该报驻华盛顿记者的一篇通讯说，如果美国进一步进行挑衅，“它将冒发动一场严重冲突的危险，在这场冲突里，它将根本得不到它的盟国的有力支持，甚至得不到很大一部分美国人民的支持”。文章说，美国某些人士抨击政府进行这种危险的“赌博”。但是，美国又怕停止这种挑衅会失去“威信”和“面子”。
    这家报纸在同一天发表的一篇评论说：“艾森豪威尔应该考虑到他处于孤立状态的种种危险。”它认为，美国的挑衅不能指望得到其他西方国家的支持。
    “瑞士报”在27日发表的由雷诺·博姆署名的社论也指出，在中国的现状无法改变的实际情况下，美国继续支持蒋介石使它处于站不住脚的地位。这家报纸引用了“华盛顿邮报”谴责美国的挑衅政策使自己进退维谷的这番话以后，指出这种政策甚至在美国人当中也得不到赞成。报纸并且断定，不久以后，美国将成为拒绝承认中华人民共和国和拒绝它进入联合国的唯一国家。
