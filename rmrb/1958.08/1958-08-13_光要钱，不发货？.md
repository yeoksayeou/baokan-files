　　Only Wants Money, But Doesn't Deliver Goods?
　　In early March of this year, through the introduction of the Beijing Municipal Pig Production Office, our agricultural cooperative ordered a feed pulverizer from the Taizhou Iron Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province. They wrote to us saying that payment should be made first, and the goods would be delivered within a month after the payment was received. So, on March 25th, our cooperative remitted a prepayment of 180 yuan to them through the People's Bank. However, more than four months have passed since the payment was remitted, and the Taizhou Iron Factory has not yet delivered the machine. Our cooperative has sent several letters urging them to deliver, but we have received no response.
　　We believe that if the Taizhou Iron Factory is indeed facing difficulties and cannot deliver the goods on time, we would be understanding if they promptly replied to our cooperative explaining the situation. However, they neither deliver the goods on time nor provide any response, which is truly intolerable to us.

### 光要钱，不发货？

　　光要钱，不发货？
    我社在今年3月初，经北京市生猪生产办公室介绍，向江苏省泰州市公私合营泰州铁工厂订购饲料粉碎机一台。他们来信说先付款，款到后一个月内交货。于是我社在3月25日由人民银行给他们汇去预付定金一百八十元。可是款汇去以后，至今四个多月，泰州铁工厂还没有把机器发来。我社数次去信催问，不见回音。
    我们认为，如果泰州铁工厂确有困难，不能按期交货，及时给我社回信说明情况，我们是可以谅解的。但他们既不按期交货，也不作任何答复，这使我们实在无法容忍。
