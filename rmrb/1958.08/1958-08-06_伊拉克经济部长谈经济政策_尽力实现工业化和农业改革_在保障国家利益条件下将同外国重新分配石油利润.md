(Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 5th) Iraqi Republic's Minister of Economy, Kuba, in a conversation with a reporter from "Al-Hurriyah" regarding Iraq's economic policies, pointed out that Iraq will strive to achieve industrialization and carry out agricultural reforms.

Kuba said that Iraq's economic policies should be based on the following principles:

First, make the national economy serve the country and its political goals.

Second, use national income to develop production. We will direct all agricultural products towards our goals, instead of letting them fall into the hands of feudal lords. To achieve this, it is necessary to change the nature of land ownership and abolish some laws that previously favored feudal lords.

He pointed out that in the past, much of Iraq's industrial and commercial income either flowed abroad or fell into the hands of a few people in Iraq, especially foreign companies, instead of being used for production. We will do our utmost, both in terms of manpower and financial resources, to industrialize the country.

Third, there is an urgent need to implement agricultural reform. He said that this is not a superficial reform but a fundamental one. We will limit land ownership and adopt small land ownership and cooperative systems, thereby breaking the foundation of feudal production. We will supply agriculture with machinery and modern equipment to mechanize agriculture.

He said that the most important thing is that agricultural reform cannot be implemented without industrialization, because agriculture and industry are interconnected. Our industrial raw materials should be supplied by ourselves instead of being imported from foreign countries.

However, he pointed out that sound economic policies must cooperate with other countries. It is necessary to eliminate economic and political isolation from other countries. On this basis, we have announced that we respect previous obligations regarding oil, provided that these obligations do not violate national interests.

He said that we will also adhere to this policy in dealing with foreign capital. We are not against foreign capital, but against using this capital to undermine the interests of our national income.

(Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 4th) Iraqi Republic's Minister of Economy, Kuba, told a reporter from the "Iraq Times" on the 3rd that the Iraqi government is prepared to hold negotiations with foreign oil companies in Iraq so that Iraq can obtain a larger share in the distribution of these oil companies' profits, according to the terms of the existing oil agreements between the Iraqi government and the oil companies.

The Iraqi Petroleum Company, jointly formed by several British, American, and French oil companies, monopolizes Iraq's oil resources and plunders Iraq's oil in large quantities. In 1951, in order to undermine the Iraqi people's movement to nationalize the oil industry, Britain signed a new oil agreement with the former Iraqi traitorous government, stipulating that company profits would be "split equally" between the company and the Iraqi rulers. However, in reality, due to the various tricks played by the imperialists, the Iraqi traitorous government did not receive 50% of the profits.

    伊拉克经济部长谈经济政策
    尽力实现工业化和农业改革
    在保障国家利益条件下将同外国重新分配石油利润
    据新华社巴格达5日电　伊拉克共和国经济部长库巴就伊拉克的经济政策问题向“自由报”记者发表谈话时指出，伊拉克将要尽力实现工业化和进行农业改革。
    库巴说，伊拉克的经济政策应当以下列原则为基础：
    第一、使国民经济为国家和它的政治目标服务。
    第二、把国民收入用在发展生产上。我们将把所有农业产品导向我们的目标，而不是让它们落入封建主的腰包。要做到这一点，就必须使土地所有制的性质有所改变和取消一些过去有利于封建主的一些法律。
    他指出，过去伊拉克很多的工业收入和商业收入不是流向国外就是落入伊拉克少数人手中，尤其是外国公司手中，而不是用于生产。我们将尽我们人力上和财政上的最大能力来使国家工业化。
    第三、迫切需要实行农业改革。他说，这不是一种表面上的改革而是根本的改革。我们将限制土地所有权，采用小土地所有制和合作制，这样来打破封建性生产的基础。我们将以机器和现代装备供给农业，使农业机械化。
    他说，最重要的是，农业改革如果没有工业化就不能实行，因为农业和工业是互相关联的。我们的工业原料应当由自己供应，而不从外国进口。
    但是他指出，健全的经济政策必须同其他国家合作。必须消除在经济上和政治上同其他国家隔绝的现象。在这个基础上，我们宣布了我们尊重以前在石油方面的义务，条件是这些义务不违反国家利益。
    他说，我们在对待外国资本方面也将遵守这个方针。我们并不反对外国资本，但是反对利用这种资本来破坏我国国民收入的利益。
    据新华社巴格达4日电　伊拉克共和国经济部长库巴在3日向“伊拉克时报”记者发表谈话说，伊拉克政府准备同在伊拉克的外国石油公司举行谈判，以便根据伊拉克政府同各石油公司之间现有的石油协定的条款，使伊拉克在分配这些石油公司的利润时能够取得较大的份额。
    英美法的几家石油公司合组成的伊拉克石油公司垄断着伊拉克的石油富源，大量掠夺伊拉克的石油。1951年，为了破坏伊拉克人民要求把石油业收归国有的运动，英国就同前伊拉克卖国政府签订了新的石油协定，规定公司利润由公司和伊拉克统治者“平分”。但实际上由于帝国主义者耍了各种手法，伊拉克卖国政府远没有得到50％利润。伊拉克共和国政府举行内阁会议。右起第三人为总理卡塞姆将军。（附图片）
