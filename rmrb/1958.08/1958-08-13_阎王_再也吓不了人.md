Editorial Note:

"King Yama" Can No Longer Scare People

"A big belly swelling (kala-azar) clings to your body, King Yama has a rope tied to your heel…" This is a folk rhyme that circulated in Shandong before liberation. At that time, the vast number of peasants were both poor and sickly, and once afflicted by disease, they could only wait for death. They were human beings, yet they could not control their own destiny.

Not long ago, history completely turned over, and things that everyone thought were impossible in the past are now presented to people like myths. Today's news reports that Shandong Province has basically eliminated kala-azar, which has harmed the people for more than eighty years. The people of this province have accomplished what they could not accomplish in the past seventy years. A total of 250,000 kala-azar patients have been cured throughout the province, and the prevalence rate of kala-azar has dropped from more than 35 per 10,000 to 0.6 per 10,000. What "big belly swelling," what "King Yama," can no longer frighten people! Our brave and hardworking people, under the leadership of the Party, have stood up and are now able to control their own destiny. The "god of destiny," in the face of the people who have stood up, is just the garbage of the times, swept away like other garbage in the superstructure!

　　“阎王”再也吓不了人
    “大肚子痞（黑热病）缠了身，阎王拴着脚后跟……”，这是解放前流传在山东一带的民谣。那时，广大农民既穷又白，一旦病魔缠身，只有等死。他们是人，然而他们不能掌握自己的命运。
    曾几何时，历史整整翻了个个，过去大家认为办不到的事，一桩桩地像神话般摆在人们的面前。今天的消息报道，山东省已经基本上消灭了危害人民八十多年的黑热病，这个省的人民做到了过去七十多年没有做到的事。全省共治好二十五万黑热病病人，黑热病流行率已由万分之三十五以上降低到万分之零点六。什么“大肚子痞”，什么“阎王”，再也吓唬不住人了！我们勇敢而勤劳的人民，在党的领导下，已经站起来了，已经能够自己掌握住自己的命运了。“命运之神”在已经站起来的人民面前，只是时代的垃圾，同其它上层建筑中的垃圾一样一扫而光了！
