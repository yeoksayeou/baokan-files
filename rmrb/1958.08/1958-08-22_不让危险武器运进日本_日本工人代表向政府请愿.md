Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 20th: Yokohama dockworkers, who are in the midst of opposing the import of "Oerlikon 56" missiles, representatives from the "Joint Struggle Conference to Stop the Import of Oerlikon 56 Missiles," and Hirota, the Secretary-General of the Kanagawa Prefecture Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, totaling one hundred people, traveled to Tokyo in two buses today. They joined one hundred representatives from the Tokyo Regional Council of Trade Unions in front of the "Defense Agency" to petition against the import of these Swiss missiles and all other weapons that could lead to the danger of war into Japan.

The representatives also made similar protests to other relevant government agencies.

According to Kyodo News, the "Defense Agency," recognizing the great difficulty in unloading the missiles in Yokohama, is considering sending the "Arima Maru," which is carrying the missiles, to the Port of Nagoya for unloading.

  “阻止运进厄利康五六型导弹联合斗争会议”代表，神奈川县禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务局长广田等一百人，今天分坐两辆公共汽车到达东京，在日本“防卫厅”前面同东京地方工会评议会代表一百人汇合，向“防卫厅”请愿，坚决反对把这种瑞士导弹和其它一切足以招致战争危险的武器运进日本。
    代表们还向有关的其它政府机关进行了类似的抗议。
    据共同社透露，“防卫厅”鉴于要在横滨卸下导弹非常困难，因此打算把装载导弹的“有马丸”开到名古屋港去起卸。
