　　Planting Miao Beans on the Mountains

    Jingxi County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a remote rocky mountain area, where most villages are "70% rock and 30% soil." After collectivization, the county, based on the characteristics of the rocky mountain area, thoroughly summarized the historical experience of mountain people planting Miao beans and decided to promote the method of planting Miao beans on the mountains. In 1956, the county planted more than 9,000 mu of Miao beans. In 1957, this was expanded to more than 130,000 mu. This year, it has been expanded by 363.1% compared to last year.

    Miao bean is a legume crop that is easy to grow. It is planted after the Awakening of Insects (Jingzhe) and harvested after the Beginning of Winter (Lidong). It has high yields and many uses. It can be planted on any rocky mountain cliff with a little soil. The beans, pods, and leaves of Miao beans are all good feed for raising pigs. The beans can also be eaten by humans after being cooked and rinsed in water. Generally, each mu yields about 200 jin of beans, with a maximum yield of over 600 jin.

    Now, Jingxi is full of lush green Miao beans, and all areas are actively working to protect the seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest of Miao beans.

　　苗豆上山
    广西僮族自治区靖西县是一个偏远的石山地区，大部分乡是七分石头三分土，合作化后，该县根据石山区的特点，深入总结山区人民种植苗豆的历史经验，确定推广苗豆上山的办法。1956年全县共种苗豆九千多亩，1957年扩大到十三万多亩，今年又比去年扩大363.1％。
    苗豆是一种豆科作物，易生易种。惊蛰种、立冬收，产量高，用途大，凡是有一点土的石山崖就可种。苗豆的豆粒、豆荚、豆叶都是养猪的好饲料。豆粒煮熟用水漂过人也能食用。一般每亩收豆粒二百斤左右，最高可收六百斤以上。
    现在靖西满山遍野已长出油绿的苗豆，各地正在积极做好保苗工作，争取苗豆大丰收。
