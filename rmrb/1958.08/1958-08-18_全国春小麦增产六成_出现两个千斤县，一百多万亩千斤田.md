Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 17th: This reporter learned at the National Spring Wheat On-Site Conference in Lanzhou that this year, the nation's spring wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The spring wheat planting area was more than 45 million mu. Although it was 1.28 million mu less than in 1957, the total output still reached 11 billion jin, an increase of 4.5 billion jin compared to 1957, representing a growth of 60.8%. The yield per mu was 244.8 jin, an increase of 103.7 jin compared to 1957, representing a growth of 73.5%.

According to statistics reported by various provinces, this year, two spring wheat counties in the country achieved thousand-jin yields, namely Hezheng and Dunhuang in Gansu. In addition, eleven counties and cities with yields between 700 jin and less than 1,000 jin per mu include Zhangye, Wuwei, Kangle, Gaotai, Linxia, and Linxia City in Gansu; Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Huangzhong, Guide, and Xining City in Qinghai; and Wuzhong in Ningxia. Sixteen counties and cities with yields between 500 jin and less than 700 jin per mu include Yumen, Gulang, Shandan, Yongchang, Minle, Guanghe, and Weiyuan in Gansu; Huangyuan, Hualong Hui Autonomous County, and Xunhua Salar Autonomous County in Qinghai; Zhongwei, Zhongning, Ningshuo, and Yinchuan in the Ningxia region; Urumqi City in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; and Linhe in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

There are many examples of large-scale and high-yield spring wheat this year. According to incomplete statistics from Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Heilongjiang provinces and regions, there are 1.13 million mu of wheat fields with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu (of which 810,000 mu in Gansu have a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu). Among them, 15,386 mu have yields of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu, 372 mu have yields of 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, and 120 mu have yields of 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu. Some experimental fields in Dabanzao Commune, Dongfanghong Commune, and Xinzhong Commune in Zhongwei County, Ningxia, have yields of over 5,200 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 17th: The National Spring Wheat On-Site Conference, which lasted for twenty days, concluded in Lanzhou on the 13th. The biggest gains of this conference are: shedding the label of low-yield for spring wheat, preventing the trend of declining spring wheat planting area, and compiling a preliminary national leap forward plan for 1959 based on the preliminary plans of spring wheat in various provinces and regions.

Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia provinces and regions, as well as the northern parts of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces, are all spring wheat planting areas in our country. These areas generally have low winter temperatures and short frost-free periods, making it impossible to plant winter wheat successfully, but spring wheat is very suitable. For many years, spring wheat has been considered a low-yield crop, and leadership has not paid enough attention to spring wheat production, resulting in very low yields.

In order to reverse people's incorrect perception of spring wheat, the Ministry of Agriculture chose Gansu Province as the location for this National Spring Wheat On-Site Conference to learn from Gansu's experience in planting spring wheat. This year, Gansu's spring wheat planting area accounts for 21.6% of the country's total, but its output accounts for 33.3% of the country's total, with 810,000 mu of high-yield spring wheat fields yielding over 1,000 jin per mu.

What particularly moved the representatives of various provinces and regions was that Gansu's natural conditions are not good. For example, Dunhuang County is located on the Gobi Desert, Anxi County is a famous "world wind depot," and Hezheng County is an area with an altitude of 2,100 meters and a frost-free period of only 130 days, but they have all created large-scale high-yield achievements in spring wheat. Many representatives believe that their regions have better conditions in all aspects than Gansu, but their yields are not as high as Gansu, and the main reason is not that the conditions are not as good as Gansu, but that their thinking is not keeping up.

### 全国春小麦增产六成　出现两个千斤县，一百多万亩千斤田

　　全国春小麦增产六成
　　出现两个千斤县，一百多万亩千斤田
    据新华社兰州17日电　本社记者在兰州全国春小麦现场会上获悉，今年全国春小麦已获得空前大丰收。春小麦播种面积四千五百多万亩，虽然比1957年减少了一百二十八万亩，但总产量仍高达一百一十亿斤，比1957年增产四十五亿斤，即增长60.8％。亩产量二百四十四点八斤，比1957年增产一百零三点七斤，即增长73.5％。
    根据各省报产统计，今年全国出现了两个春小麦千斤县，即甘肃的和政和敦煌。另外，亩产七百斤以上不足一千斤的有甘肃的张掖、武威、康乐、高台、临夏和临夏市，青海的互助土族自治县、湟中、贵德和西宁市，宁夏的吴忠等十一县、市。亩产五百斤以上不足七百斤的有甘肃的玉门、古浪、山丹、永昌、民乐、广河和渭源，青海的湟源、化隆回族自治县和循化撒拉族自治县，宁夏地区的中卫、中宁、宁朔和银川，新疆维吾尔自治区的乌鲁木齐市，内蒙古自治区的临河等十六个县、市。
    今年春小麦大面积丰产和高额丰产的事例很多。据甘肃、青海、宁夏、新疆、内蒙古、陕西、黑龙江等省、区的不完全统计，亩产一千斤以上的麦田有一百一十三万亩
  （其中甘肃亩产千斤以上的有八十一万亩），其中亩产两千斤到三千斤的有一万五千三百八十六亩，三千斤到四千斤的有三百七十二亩，四千斤到五千斤的有一百二十亩，宁夏地区中卫县大板糟社、东方红社和新中社有些试验田亩产都在五千二百多斤以上。
    据新华社兰州17日电　历时二十天的全国春小麦现场会议13日在兰州结束。这次会议的最大收获是：摘掉了春小麦低产的帽子，防止了春小麦播种面积下降的趋势，同时根据各省、区春小麦的初步规划，综合编出全国1959年初步的跃进计划。
    甘肃、新疆、青海、宁夏、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江和内蒙古等省、区以及陕西、山西和河北三省的北部，都是我国春小麦种植地区，这些地区一般冬季温度低，无霜期短，种冬小麦不能顺利越冬，但种春小麦却很合适。多少年来认为春小麦是低产作物，不重视领导春小麦生产，因此产量很低。
    为了扭转人们对春小麦的不正确看法，农业部选择甘肃省作为这次全国春小麦现场会议的地址，学习甘肃种植春小麦的经验。甘肃今年春小麦播种面积占全国的21.6％，产量却占全国的33.3％，出现了亩产千斤以上的丰产春小麦八十一万亩。
    特别使各省、区代表感动的是，甘肃自然条件并不好，像敦煌县处在戈壁沙漠上，安西县是有名的“世界风库”，和政县是海拔二千一百公尺、无霜期只一百三十天的地区，但都创造出春小麦大面积高产成就来。不少代表认为自己地区各方面条件都比甘肃强，但是产量不如甘肃高，主要原因不是条件不如甘肃，而是思想跟不上。
