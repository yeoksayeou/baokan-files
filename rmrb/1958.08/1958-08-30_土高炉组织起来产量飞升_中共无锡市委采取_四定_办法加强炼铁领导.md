Indigenous Blast Furnaces Organized, Production Soars
The Wuxi Municipal Committee of the CCP Adopts "Four Determinations" Method to Strengthen Iron Smelting Leadership
(Our Correspondent Zhang Jing reports) The Wuxi Municipal Committee of the CCP has adopted a method of determination of type, group, personnel, and quantity to organize the city's scattered indigenous blast furnaces, concentrating on production and technical leadership. The city's iron output has rapidly risen in a straight line.

Over the past two months, Wuxi has built more than 5,000 indigenous blast furnaces, but very few have been able to produce iron normally, with a daily output of only two or three tons. An important reason for this is that after the indigenous furnaces were built in a scattered manner, the furnace types were different, the operations were inconsistent, and each beat their own drum, making it difficult to exchange technical experience. In response to this situation, the Municipal Committee adopted the "Four Determinations" measures to organize the scattered furnaces and concentrate on leadership.

The first is determination of type. The city's existing furnaces were ranked, and the advanced furnaces that had been proven to produce iron normally through practice were identified. Types were determined according to the characteristics of each unit, resulting in ten types including the Cha Qiao type, the Min Feng type, the Wang Yuanji type, and the Shanxi type, and their technical operation experience was summarized and promoted throughout the city. Some substandard furnaces that could not produce iron were resolutely dismantled and rebuilt according to the determined type, and those of poor quality were also built or rebuilt according to similar types. The second is determination of group. After determining the type, indigenous furnace groups were organized in areas with suitable conditions. The same type was formed into a group, with dozens or even hundreds of furnaces built around a good furnace, forming a form of joint enterprise. For example, the Nan Chang District divided the units and furnace types with the best iron output into three groups. The Wang Yuanji group built around 139 furnaces, and there were also the Geng Yu group, the Shengda-type furnace group, etc. The benefit of organizing indigenous furnace groups is that it facilitates production leadership, facilitates the exchange of experience, allows the experienced to lead the inexperienced, and the good to lead the bad, which facilitates the faster cultivation of technical forces, and also makes it easier to control and dispatch raw material supply and equipment use. The third is determination of personnel. Each furnace, each furnace group, and each enterprise, organ, and unit in the city has a dedicated person responsible for the leadership of steel production. Every furnace has a head, every person has credentials, and they are divided into three shifts for continuous production. Two-tenths of the cadres from various organs in the city are drawn out and rotated off the job for a short period to engage in steel production. Each group of furnaces is also organized into many small teams and platoons. All enterprises, organs, and schools that build indigenous blast furnaces establish command posts or detachments and platoons. The top leader personally takes command and is responsible for leadership. The Municipal Committee is personally in charge of the First Secretary, and a leading group of eleven people consisting of the Secretary, Standing Committee members, and committee members, and a steel general command are formed. From top to bottom, there are people responsible at every level. If there is a problem with any furnace, it can be discovered immediately and treated quickly.

The fourth is determination of quantity. According to the tasks issued by the general command, each command post, each detachment, platoon, and small team, down to each furnace, has specific daily and monthly output targets. It has now been determined that the city's indigenous furnaces should strive for a daily output of 100 tons. The command post checks the completion of the targets every day and promptly goes to the site to solve problems when they are discovered.

After taking this "Four Determinations" measure, the city's iron output soared. On the 21st, it rose from three tons to seven tons, on the 22nd it rose again to fifteen tons, and on the 23rd it reached eighteen tons. (Attached picture)

### 土高炉组织起来产量飞升  中共无锡市委采取“四定”办法加强炼铁领导

　　土高炉组织起来产量飞升
    中共无锡市委采取“四定”办法加强炼铁领导
    本报讯　记者张竞报道：中共无锡市委采取定型、定群、定人、定量的办法，把全市分散的土高炉组织起来，集中进行生产与技术领导。全市出铁量迅速直线上升。
    两个月来，无锡市已建起五千多土高炉，但是能够正常出铁的却很少，每天出铁只有两、三吨。其中很重要的原因是因为土炉子分散建立以后，炉型各异，操作不一，各打各的锣鼓，不易进行技术经验的交流。市委针对这情况，采取了“四定”的措施。把分散的炉子组织起来集中进行领导。
    首先是定型。把全市已建的炉子进行排队，找出其中经过实践证明能够正常出铁的先进炉子，按各单位自己的特点进行定型，一共定出查桥式、民丰式、王元吉式、山西式等十种类型，并总结他们的技术操作经验，在全市推广。有些不合规格的不能出铁的炉子，坚决拆掉按已定的型号重建，质量不好的也按相似的型号修建或改建。第二是定群。在定型以后，在有条件的地区组织土炉群，同一种型号的组成一群，一个好炉子周围建几十个甚至上百个炉子，结成联合企业的形式。如南长区把出铁最好的单位和炉型分成三群，王元吉群，就围建了一百三十九只炉子，还有赓裕群，生达式炉群等。组织土炉群的好处是便于生产领导，便于交流经验，有经验的带没经验的，好的带坏的，这就便于更快的培养技术力量，而且在原材料的供应和设备使用上也更便于掌握和调度。第三是定人。全市每一只炉子，每一个炉群，每一个企业、机关单位都有专人负责钢铁生产的领导。做到炉有长，人有证，分成三班，连续生产。全市各机关抽出十分之二的干部，短期轮流脱产搞钢铁。每一群炉子也编成许多小队、中队。各企业、机关、学校，凡是建土高炉的都设立指挥部或大队、中队。由领导的第一把手亲自挂帅，负责领导，市委则第一书记亲自掌握，并组成由书记、常委和委员十一人的领导小组和钢铁总指挥部。从上到下，层层有人负责，哪一个炉子出了毛病，立即就能发现并且很快给予治疗。
    第四是定量。按总指挥部下达的任务，各指挥部、各大队、中队、小队，直到每个炉子每日每月都有具体的产量指标，现已确定全市土炉子争取日产量为一百吨。指挥部每天检查指标完成情况，发现问题及时深入现场解决。
    采取了这个“四定”措施以后，全市铁的产量扶摇直上。21日从三吨上升到七吨，22日又上升到十五吨，23日达到十八吨。（附图片）
