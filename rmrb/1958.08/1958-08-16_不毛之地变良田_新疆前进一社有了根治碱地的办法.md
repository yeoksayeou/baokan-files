　　Barren Land Transformed into Fertile Fields
　　Xinjiang Qianjin First Cooperative Finds a Way to Fundamentally Cure Alkaline Land
    Urumqi Dispatch from this newspaper: (Reporter Yang Kexian) The Uyghur farmers of the Qianjin First Cooperative in Lasikui Township, Hotan County, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, fought hard through winter and spring, transforming saline-alkali land into fertile fields in one giant leap. This year's summer harvest of 1,500 mu of wheat averaged over 400 jin per mu, achieving the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program and even recording yields of over 1,000 jin per mu on ten mu of land.

    Much of the land cultivated by farmers of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region is saline-alkali soil, and the land of the Lasikui Qianjin First Cooperative at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains belongs to the most severely saline-alkali type. Of the cooperative's total of 3,172 mu of cultivated land, 98% is saline-alkali, with severely alkaline land accounting for over 66%. The masses describe these lands as: "Weeds struggle to grow, seeds cannot be harvested," and "Walking barefoot across severely alkaline land, two layers of skin peel off your feet." For thousands of years, Uyghur farmers have struggled against alkaline land. But before liberation, lightly alkaline land yielded only about 100 jin of grain per mu per year, and severely alkaline land only 30 to 50 jin.

    After agricultural cooperation, the Uyghur farmers here used new-style animal-powered farm implements, practiced intensive cultivation, and applied more fertilizer, increasing production year after year. In 1957, the Qianjin First Cooperative was rated as a second-class model cooperative in Hotan County. However, the harm from alkaline soil was not fundamentally cured. That year, wheat yielded 180 jin per mu, early corn yielded 200 jin per mu, and late corn yielded 76 jin; 180 mu of severely alkaline land yielded only 17 jin of corn per mu, and no harvest was reaped from 400 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland.

    Last winter and this spring, during the socialist education campaign in rural Hotan, the agricultural cooperative voiced more than 600 opinions on the work of fundamentally curing alkaline harm. They made soil improvement the primary key to increasing production this year, and put forward the slogan of "working hard for two years to change the face of alkaline land." However, the measures for treating alkaline soil were still limited to topsoil treatments such as covering with sand, applying fertilizer, washing, and soaking. Ren Chongli, the Han cadre stationed in the cooperative, borrowed books everywhere for this purpose, and after consulting numerous books and newspapers, he finally saw an old newspaper article that the digging of drainage ditches could cure alkaline harm. He then studied it with the local Uyghur farmers and found that the local alkaline land was all in low-lying areas, while the more than 50 mu of land along the riverbank, which was higher than the riverbed, had no alkaline harm at all. In this way, everyone affirmed that to completely cure alkaline land in Lasikui, it was necessary to vigorously dig drainage ditches, lower the water table, and combine the past topsoil treatment of alkaline soil with the fundamental cure of underground drainage. In the severe winter, Uyghur farmers worked hard for eleven days and nights, digging more than 60,000 cubic meters of earth, and digging four drainage ditches with a total length of more than 8,000 meters in more than 1,500 mu of spring wheat land. Before and after spring sowing, the farmers washed these lands again with water, spreading more than 30,000 jin of wall soil and house soil per mu, 15,000 jin to 45,000 jin of fertilizer, deep plowing 15 to 20 centimeters, and increasing the seeding rate from the original 18 jin per mu to more than 22 jin, and implemented other advanced agricultural measures, enabling wheat to obtain a bumper harvest. The autumn corn is growing even more luxuriantly, and a comprehensive bumper harvest is very promising.

    After this victory in fundamentally curing alkaline land, the Uyghur farmers of Lasikui Township have gone from being half-believing to firmly believing in the truth that people are the masters of the land, that they can only conquer alkaline land and cannot succumb to it.

### 不毛之地变良田　新疆前进一社有了根治碱地的办法

　　不毛之地变良田
　　新疆前进一社有了根治碱地的办法
    本报乌鲁木齐讯　记者杨克现报道：新疆维吾尔自治区和阗县拉斯奎乡前进第一社的维吾尔族农民，大战了一冬一春，一步登天地把盐碱地改造成为良田。今年夏收作物一千五百亩小麦，平均亩产超过四百斤，实现了农业发展纲要的指标，并出现了十亩亩产一千多斤的纪录。
    自治区各族农民种植的土地，有不少是盐碱化的土壤，而昆仑山下的拉斯奎前进一社土地，属于盐碱化最严重的一类。这个社共有耕地三千一百七十二亩，其中98％是盐碱地，而重碱地竟占到66％以上。群众形容这些土地是：“野草难生长、种子收不回”“赤脚走过重碱地，脚底脱去两层皮”。千百年来，维吾尔族农民一直与碱地斗争。但在解放前，轻碱地每亩年产量只有一百来斤粮，重碱地只有三、五十斤。
    农业合作化以后，这里的维吾尔族农民使用了新式畜力农具，精耕细作，增施肥料，生产年年提高，1957年前进一社被评为和阗县二等模范社。但是碱害并没有根治，这一年小麦亩产一百八十斤，早玉米亩产二百斤，晚玉米七十六斤；一百八十亩重碱地亩产只有十七斤玉米，新开四百亩荒地，颗粒未收。
    去冬今春和阗农村开展社会主义教育时，这个农业社就根治碱害的工作，鸣放了六百多条意见，把土壤改良工作作为今年增产的首要关键，提出了“苦战两年改变碱地面貌”的口号。但是治碱的措施还停留在压沙、施肥、冲洗、泡水等表土治碱的办法上。驻社汉族干部任崇礼为此到处向人借书，不知翻了多少书报，终于在一张旧报纸上看到了挖排碱沟可以治碱害的办法。他便和当地维吾尔族农民共同研究，发现当地碱地全在低洼地方，而河边高出河床的五十多亩地全部没有碱害。这样大家肯定了拉斯奎地方要彻底治碱，必须大力挖掘排碱沟，降低地下水位，把过去表土治碱和地下排碱根治碱害结合起来。就在严寒冬天，维吾尔族农民苦战了十一昼夜，挖掘六万多方土，在一千五百多亩春麦地里挖了共长八千多公尺的四条排碱沟。春播前后，农民又把这些土地用水洗了一遍，每亩铺上墙土和房土三万多斤，肥料一万五千斤到四万五千斤，深耕十五到二十公分，播种量也从原来每亩十八斤加到二十二斤以上，并贯彻了其他农业先进措施，使小麦获得了丰产，秋田玉米生长更为茂密，全面丰收大有希望。
    经过了这一次根治碱地的胜利，拉斯奎乡的维吾尔族农民已经从半信半疑到坚信人是土地的主宰，只能征服碱地、不能屈服于碱地的真理。
