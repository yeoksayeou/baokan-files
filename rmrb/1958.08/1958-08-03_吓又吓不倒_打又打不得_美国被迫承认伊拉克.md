    Intimidation Doesn't Work, Fighting is Out of the Question
    The United States is Forced to Recognize Iraq
    (Reported by this newspaper) Washington dispatch: A U.S. State Department official announced on the 2nd that the United States has recognized the government of the Republic of Iraq.
    It is remembered that U.S. President Eisenhower, in his speech on July 15, falsely accused the Iraqi people's revolution to overthrow the reactionary Faisal dynasty as "seizing a country by indirect aggression," and said that the "scope of the aggressive purpose" demonstrated by the Iraqi event was something that "Lebanon cannot cope with." He said: "Therefore, Lebanon has requested the United States to send troops. Therefore, we have granted this request." Under this pretext, the United States sent troops to occupy Lebanon and threatened the nascent Republic of Iraq with war. Now, obviously due to the support of socialist countries and the people of the world for the Republic of Iraq, and because the aggressive actions of U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East have been opposed by the whole world, the U.S. government has been forced to change its original attitude and announce its recognition of the Republic of Iraq. This action by the U.S. government is, in effect, a declaration that its sending troops to occupy Lebanon was an unjustified act of aggression.
    However, it is worth noting that while recognizing the Republic of Iraq, the United States is continuing to increase its troops in Lebanon. According to reports, another 1,800 U.S. invading troops equipped with artillery and tanks landed in Lebanon on the 2nd. According to Holloway, commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, another three or four thousand U.S. troops will continue to land successively. Not only that, but the United States is also evacuating its nationals from Iraq on a large scale. According to a Reuters report, the United States evacuated 700 American nationals from Iraq on July 30 alone. All these actions by the United States are clearly completely contradictory to its recognition of the government of the Republic of Iraq.
    News from the United States also says that recognizing the government of the Republic of Iraq is also part of the U.S. preparations for holding a high-level meeting, and that the U.S. wants to escape accusations of U.S. aggression against Iraq at the high-level meeting. However, observers here point out that since the United States is still increasing its troops in Lebanon, it can neither escape the blame for threatening Iraq, nor can it escape its crime of aggression against Lebanon.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: The governments of Lebanon, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, and Portugal officially announced their recognition of the Republic of Iraq on August 1.

### 吓又吓不倒　打又打不得  美国被迫承认伊拉克

    吓又吓不倒　打又打不得
    美国被迫承认伊拉克
    本报讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院官员2日宣布，美国已经承认伊拉克共和国政府。
    人们记得，美国总统艾森豪威尔在他7月15日发表的演说中，曾经把伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔反动王朝的革命诬称为是“用间接侵略的办法拿下一个国家”，并且说伊拉克事件所表现出的“侵略目的的范围”，“黎巴嫩是不能加以应付的”。他说：“因此，黎巴嫩向美国提出了派遣军队的要求。因此，我们答应了这个要求。”在这个借口之下，美国派兵侵占了黎巴嫩，并以战争威胁新生的伊拉克共和国。现在，显然是由于社会主义国家和全世界人民对伊拉克共和国的支持，由于美英帝国主义侵略中东的行为遭到了全世界的反对，美国政府已被迫不得不改变它原来的态度，而宣布承认伊拉克共和国。美国政府的这一行动，实际上就等于宣布它派兵侵占黎巴嫩是毫无道理的侵略行为。
    可是，值得注意的是，美国在承认了伊拉克共和国的同时，还在继续向黎巴嫩增兵。据报道，2日又有装备着大炮和坦克的一千八百名美国侵略军队在黎巴嫩登陆。又据美国驻中东部队司令霍洛威说，还将有三四千名美军随后要陆续登陆。不止如此，美国还在大规模地从伊拉克撤退侨民。据路透社消息，仅在7月30日一天，美国就从伊拉克撤走了七百名美国侨民。美国所有的这些做法，显然与它承认伊拉克共和国政府的行动又是完全矛盾的。
    又有从美国传来的消息说，承认伊拉克共和国政府也是美国为举行高级会议所作的准备工作的一部分，美国想在高级会议上逃脱美国侵略伊拉克的指责。可是，此间的观察家指出，既然美国还在向黎巴嫩增兵，那么，它就既逃不脱威胁伊拉克的罪责，更逃不脱它对黎巴嫩的侵略罪责。
    据新华社2日讯　黎巴嫩、芬兰、挪威、丹麦、瑞士和葡萄牙六国政府在8月1日正式宣布承认伊拉克共和国。
