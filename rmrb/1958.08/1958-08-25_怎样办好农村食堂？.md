Agricultural cooperatives running public canteens for collective dining is a very meaningful new development in today's countryside. It's a significant reform in farmers' living habits and lifestyles. Because it's a new thing, it's inevitable that many problems will be encountered during the trial implementation. Some people among the masses may also have various concerns about public canteens. Recently, we have received many letters from readers, all raising some concerns. These can be summarized as follows:

I. Farmers' lives are not affluent at present. Throughout the year, families have to flexibly arrange their meals based on the amount of grain, the busy or slack periods of farm work, the number of people working versus those not working, and other factors. For example, they eat more vegetables and melons to save grain during normal times; they eat porridge on slack days or rainy days; and they eat better when the work is heavy. This habit has been passed down through generations and plays a significant role in saving grain. However, once a canteen is established, such arrangements become difficult. Farmers may think this is "eating from the big pot," and that they will be fed until they are full. They might drop their saving habits, like cadres eating in canteens, handing over their rations to the canteen, which then has to guarantee that they are fed. How should this problem be solved?

II. People have different tastes. The elderly, children, and sick people in a family also need different care. How can this problem be solved when a large canteen is set up, bringing together large and small from each household?

III. Should the cooperative's income distribution, including grain and cash, be deducted as a whole and allocated to the canteen? Or should it be distributed to the members, who then hand it over based on their circumstances? Many cooperatives hardly ever distribute cash to their members. Members' pocket money is usually earned by selling vegetables and fruits from their private plots, doing some sideline work, or selling eggs and fattened pigs. It would be difficult if the cooperative doesn't distribute money to the members but demands it from them. It would be a considerable burden if the canteen is paid for by the cooperative.

IV. Currently, the account books of agricultural cooperatives are often not clear enough, especially the team's accounts. There is also a lack of management personnel. However, this is a crucial aspect of running a canteen well. How can this problem be solved?

V. 社 cadres manage too many things, and it's likely they won't manage everything well. They are busy with production and cannot take care of life, let alone grasp ideology. Would it be too heavy a burden if they now take on the responsibility of the members' meals?

We hope that everyone will discuss these issues. Regions that have already established public canteens and gained experience should quickly write out solutions to these specific problems based on practical experience. This would be helpful to other regions. Only when the broad masses understand the practices and benefits of public canteens, and their concerns are eliminated, can this method, which is very beneficial to the development of production, be gradually promoted. Conversely, if the masses' questions are not answered, the practices and benefits are not explained, and things are done simply, it can turn a good thing into a bad one, producing undesirable results. All localities should pay close attention to this. Now, we hope that all localities will first conduct specific discussions on the issues raised here.

In addition, many readers have written about the practices and experiences of public canteens. We have selected a few for publication today for reference. Anyone who believes that certain methods are inappropriate can also offer their opinions.

　　全民食堂最受欢迎
    河南沁阳县农村中举办的食堂，形式是多种多样的，各具有不同特点，大体可分为四种形式：
    （一）全民食堂。所有人口全部参加食堂吃饭，全家全民集体生活。这种形式可以使妇女完全摆脱作饭方面的家务劳动，挖出全部劳力潜力，投入生产，能充分发挥每个人的生产积极性，且能节约粮食。
    （二）半食堂。一种是各家做馍在一块喝汤；一种是在一块吃一顿或两顿，晚上各吃各。这样食堂是简单易办，但还不能充分发挥每个劳动力的作用。家庭事务未能全部摆脱，各家仍要有人做饭、磨面。
    （三）专业队食堂。就是某一专业队的生产人员在一块临时起火吃饭，这和第二种形式基本相同。
    （四）单身汉食堂。
    以上四种形式以第一种全民食堂为最好，较之其它优越。其它几种形式虽也不同程度地提高了劳动效率，但不能充分挖掘劳力潜力，最大限度地提高劳动效率，而且粮食有浪费，不易掌握。因此，目前其它形式的食堂，有些已转为全民食堂，正在筹建的也喜欢一下搞全民食堂。全民食堂是今后的发展方向。
    食堂的经济问题，特别是粮食问题处理得恰当与否，是办好食堂的一个关键性的问题。在这个问题的处理上有几种办法：第一、按以人定量标准发给每人粮票，吃多少，买多少，交多少粮票，钱算钱，粮食算粮食。第二、不发给个人粮食，只宣布各家的标准，实行饭票制度，以饭票代替粮食，吃多吃少不限量，但每天或几天核算一次，公布各户吃超过或节约情况评比表。通过评比形式，使各户自行掌握标准，厉行节约。第三、按人口大小年龄以人定量，这样就产生有的不够吃，有的吃不了。第四、按人对粮食起火，吃多少对多少。第五、没有限制，想吃多少吃多少，这样浪费较大。上述几种办法，以第一、二种为最好，既保证了每人都可以吃饱又节约粮食，群众满意，应大力推广。

The Most Popular is the All-People Canteen
In the rural areas of Qinyang County, Henan Province, the canteens that are run come in a variety of forms, each with its own characteristics, which can be roughly divided into four types:

(1) All-People Canteen. All people participate in eating in the canteen, and the whole family lives collectively. This form allows women to be completely freed from household chores such as cooking, unlocking the full potential of labor and putting it into production. It can fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of each person and save grain.

(2) Semi-Canteen. One type is that each family makes steamed buns and drinks soup together; another type is to eat one or two meals together, and each family eats separately in the evening. This kind of canteen is simple and easy to run, but it cannot fully utilize the role of each laborer. Family affairs cannot be completely freed from, and each family still needs someone to cook and grind flour.

(3) Specialized Team Canteen. That is, the production personnel of a certain specialized team temporarily start a fire to eat together, which is basically the same as the second form.

(4) Bachelor Canteen.

Among the above four forms, the first one, the All-People Canteen, is the best, and is superior to the others. Although the other forms have also improved labor efficiency to varying degrees, they cannot fully tap the potential of labor, maximize labor efficiency, and there is waste of grain, which is not easy to control. Therefore, at present, some canteens in other forms have been transformed into All-People Canteens, and those under construction also prefer to build All-People Canteens at once. The All-People Canteen is the future direction of development.

Whether the economic issues of the canteen, especially the grain issue, are handled appropriately is a key issue in running the canteen well. There are several ways to deal with this issue: First, issue grain coupons to each person according to the standard of fixed quantity per person. How much you eat, how much you buy, how many grain coupons you hand in, money is money, grain is grain. Second, do not issue grain to individuals, but only announce the standards for each household, implement a meal ticket system, and use meal tickets instead of grain. There is no limit to how much you eat, but a calculation is made every day or every few days, and a comparison table is published showing the overconsumption or savings of each household. Through the form of comparison, each household can control the standard by themselves and practice strict economy. Third, the quantity of grain is fixed per person according to the size and age of the population, which results in some not having enough to eat and some not being able to finish. Fourth, cook grain according to the number of people, how much to eat, how much to cook. Fifth, there are no restrictions, and you can eat as much as you want, which results in greater waste. Among the above methods, the first and second are the best, which not only ensures that everyone can eat their fill but also saves grain. The masses are satisfied and should be vigorously promoted.

　　算细账、大辩论、解除顾虑
    河北省张北县经过全民整风，群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高了。为了适应生产大跃进，群众迫切要求变分散吃饭为集体吃饭。因此，当县委一提出建立集体食堂时，就得到了广大群众的积极拥护。当然，在酝酿建立食堂时，也遇到了一些思想障碍。主要是在部分较富裕的社员中存在“三愁”、“四怕”、“一大顾虑”。“三愁”是：一愁站队买饭麻烦；二愁来客没法招待；三愁雨天无法吃饭。“四怕”是：一怕吃不饱；二怕不如在家吃的好；三怕小孩吃不上零食；四怕因集体吃饭加强劳动强度，没有休息时间。“一大顾虑”是：顾虑粮食入大堆，跟上缺粮户挨饿。在解决这些问题时，县委先发动群众鸣放辩论，算清四笔账：第一笔账是：建立食堂，节省劳力，有利生产；第二笔账是：各户省去做饭时间，适当增加休息时间；第三笔账是：集体吃饭省米面，省柴炭、省油盐；第四笔账是：集体吃饭，时间统一行动统一，多生产实现大跃进。同时并向社员说明：办食堂，只是农民生活习惯和生活方式的改变，不是“吃大锅饭”，吃多吃好多出粮多出钱，吃少吃孬少出粮少出钱；节余归自己，并不影响按劳取酬，也不影响“以人定量”粮食分配原则。对社员的生活资料，仍属社员个人所有。通过算细账，交代政策，辩明了是非，解除了群众的各种思想顾虑。
    群众的思想顾虑，部分又是由于一些实际问题而引起的。因此，县委在积极向群众进行思想教育的同时，经过群众的充分酝酿和讨论，建立了一些必要的食堂管理制度。

Calculating Carefully, Great Debate, Eliminating Worries
After the all-people rectification campaign in Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, the socialist consciousness of the masses has been greatly improved. In order to adapt to the Great Leap Forward in production, the masses urgently demanded to change from eating separately to eating collectively. Therefore, when the county party committee proposed the establishment of collective canteens, it was actively supported by the broad masses. Of course, during the brewing of the establishment of canteens, some ideological obstacles were also encountered. The main obstacles were "three worries," "four fears," and "one major concern" among some of the wealthier members. The "three worries" were: first, worrying about the trouble of standing in line to buy food; second, worrying about not being able to entertain guests; third, worrying about not being able to eat on rainy days. The "four fears" were: first, fearing not being able to eat enough; second, fearing that the food would not be as good as eating at home; third, fearing that children would not be able to eat snacks; fourth, fearing that collective eating would increase the intensity of labor and there would be no rest time. The "one major concern" was: worrying that grain would be put into a big pile, and they would starve along with grain-deficient households. In solving these problems, the county party committee first mobilized the masses to speak out freely and debate, and clarified the four accounts: The first account was: establishing a canteen saves labor and is beneficial to production; the second account was: each household saves time cooking and appropriately increases rest time; the third account was: collective eating saves rice, flour, firewood, charcoal, oil, and salt; the fourth account was: collective eating unifies time and unifies actions, and more production realizes the Great Leap Forward. At the same time, it was explained to the members: running a canteen is only a change in farmers' living habits and lifestyles, not "eating from the big pot." If you eat more, you will pay more grain and money, and if you eat less, you will pay less grain and money. The surplus belongs to you and does not affect remuneration according to labor, nor does it affect the principle of grain distribution "fixed quantity per person." The means of livelihood of the members still belong to the individual members. Through careful calculation, explaining policies, and clarifying right and wrong, the various ideological concerns of the masses were eliminated.

Some of the masses' ideological concerns were also caused by some practical problems. Therefore, while actively conducting ideological education among the masses, the county party committee established some necessary canteen management systems after full deliberation and discussion by the masses.

### 怎样办好农村食堂？

　　怎样办好农村食堂？
    农业社办公共食堂，集体吃饭，这是今天农村中一件很有意义的新事。它是农民生活习惯和生活方式上一项重大的改革。因为是新事情，所以在试办中不免要遇到许多的问题。群众对于公共食堂，也可能有一些人会有这样那样的疑虑。最近我们收到不少读者来信，都提出一些疑虑。集中起来有如下几点：
    一、农民的生活在目前来说还是不富裕的。他们一家老老少少，终年要根据粮食多少、农活忙闲、干活的人与不干活的人等不同情况，灵活地安排饭食。如平常吃些瓜菜之类的东西以节约粮食；农闲或阴雨天就吃点稀的；活重时就吃好些。这种习惯是祖代传下来的，对节约粮食有很大作用。但一办起食堂，这种安排就很难办到。农民会认为这是吃大锅饭，反正得管饱，会丢掉节约习惯，会像干部在食堂吃饭那样，把口粮交食堂，食堂就得管饱。这个问题怎样解决？
    二、人们口味不同，一家人中，老人、小孩、病人也需要不同的照顾。办起大食堂，把各家各户大大小小集中起来，这问题怎样解决？
    三、合作社收益分配，包括粮食和现金，是总的扣下来拨归食堂呢？还是发给社员，由社员根据情况交呢？有许多社几乎常年不给社员分现金，社员零用钱，是卖点自留地的菜、瓜果，干点副业分点红，卖个鸡蛋、肥猪等来解决。社里不分给社员，又向社员要是困难的。如食堂由社开支，这是个不小的担子。
    四、现在农业社的开支账目有许多是不够清的，特别是队的账目。管理人员也缺乏。而这一点是办好食堂的重要一关。这问题如何解决？
    五、社干部管事太多，很可能事事管不好。忙了生产，照顾不了生活，更抓不了思想。现在如果再把社员吃饭问题一总包下来，是否负担太重了呢？
    对于这些问题，我们希望大家来讨论，已经举办了公共食堂并且取得了经验的地区，应当很快地根据实践的经验，写出解决这些具体问题的办法。这是对别的地区的帮助。只有使广大群众都明白了公共食堂的做法、好处，消除了他们的疑虑，这个对发展生产大有好处的办法才能逐步推广。反之，群众的疑问不予解答，做法和好处都不讲明，简单从事，就也能使好事办坏，产生不良的结果。这点各地都应当密切注意。现在，我们希望各地首先针对这里提出的问题进行具体的讨论。
    另外，已经有不少读者写来了一些公共食堂的做法和经验，今天特选刊几件，供各地参考。谁如果认为某些办法不妥，也可以提出意见。
