　　Acupuncture Cures Deaf-Muteness
    The results of experiments conducted by Chinese medicine doctors at the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine College's Eleventh People's Hospital over the past year and a half, using acupuncture to treat nerve-related deafness and muteness, have proven the effectiveness of this method.

    At the beginning of August, the doctors selected fifty students from the Municipal Second School for the Deaf and Mute for acupuncture treatment. So far, some students have begun to recover their hearing. Now, when the teacher shouts "Attention" or "At ease" behind them, the students can respond with the correct actions.

    Prior to this, from November 1956 to June of this year, the Shanghai Eleventh People's Hospital had treated a total of 302 cases, including 120 cases of deafness. Of these, 34 showed significant improvement, and 71 showed some progress. Among the 182 cases of deaf-muteness, 50 showed significant improvement, and 94 showed some progress.

    Zhou Xiaolong, who lives at 48 Hong'an Lane, Xikang Road, is already twenty years old. In the past, he could only say "Papa" and "Mama!" Last summer, he started acupuncture treatment at the Eleventh Hospital. After two months of treatment, he began to be able to hear and speak. Although his articulation is not clear, his vocabulary is slowly increasing.

    Zhu Linlin, a primary school student living at 7 Xinxiang Lane, North Sichuan Road, became deaf due to frequent illnesses in her childhood. Western medicine diagnosed that her nerves were damaged and untreatable. At school, she had to sit in the first row and pay attention to the teacher's lip movements to understand the lesson. This June, she started acupuncture treatment. After four treatments, her hearing improved. By the sixth treatment, she could hear radio broadcasts. After the ninth treatment, she told her mother before going to bed that she heard the neighbors playing the piano. After the tenth treatment, she told the doctor, "I heard the rain last night." After sixteen treatments, her hearing was completely restored. (Attached picture)

　　针灸治聋哑
    用针灸治疗神经性聋哑，经上海中医学院附属第十一人民医院的中医师们一年半来试验的结果，已经证明疗效显著。
    8月初，医师们又在市立第二聋哑学校选择了五十名学生作针灸治疗，到目前为止，部分学生的听觉开始恢复。现在，老师在他们背后喊：“立正”，“稍息”，学生们已能用正确的动作来回答老师了。
    在这以前，上海第十一人民医院自从1956年11月到今年6月，已先后治疗三百零二个病例，其中聋子一百二十例，有显著疗效的三十四例，有进步的七十一例；聋哑一百八十二例，有显著疗效的五十例，有进步的九十四例。
    住在西康路鸿安坊四十八号的周小龙，已经二十岁了，从前，只会叫：“爸爸”“妈妈！”去年夏天，开始到第十一医院作针灸。治疗两个月后，开始能听能说了，口齿虽不伶俐，语汇却慢慢地多起来。
    住在北四川路新祥里七号的小学生朱琳琳，小时多病聋了耳朵，西医诊断是神经烧坏了，无法治疗。在学校念书要坐第一排，还要注意老师唇齿的动作，才能理解讲课的内容。今年6月开始用针灸治疗四次后，听觉就有进步。第六次时，听见无线电广播。到第九次时，临睡时她告诉妈妈，听见邻居在弹钢琴。第十次后，她告诉医师：“昨夜我听见雨声”。十六次之后，听觉完全恢复了。（附图片）
