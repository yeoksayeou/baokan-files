Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: Premier Zhou Enlai stated tonight at a reception hosted by the Indian Ambassador to China, Parthasarathi, in honor of Prime Minister Sihanouk, that the entry of the US Navy into Singapore further threatens peace in the Southeast Asian region, and the Chinese people express their firm opposition.

Premier Zhou particularly emphasized when discussing the Middle East situation: "What should draw our serious attention is that the US Navy has recently entered Singapore, further threatening peace in the Southeast Asian region. This is a new provocation by the United States against peace-loving countries and peoples of the world, especially against Asian countries and peoples. We cannot but express our firm opposition to this."

Premier Zhou once again pointed out: "The current situation in the Middle East remains dangerous, and we cannot but express our serious concern about it. Prime Minister Nehru has recently repeatedly and clearly stated that US and British troops must withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan immediately, opposing the dispatch of United Nations forces to that region. We fully agree with Prime Minister Nehru's opinion and believe that this is the correct way to resolve the Middle East crisis."

Premier Zhou Enlai said with confidence: "Today's international peace forces are unprecedentedly strong. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly advocated by the Prime Ministers of India, Nehru, Burma, U Nu, and China, representing the governments of the three countries, and firmly supported by Prince Sihanouk, represent the mainstream of the international trend. It will surely overcome all aggressive forces that undermine peace and damage relations between countries and achieve greater victories."

Premier Zhou Enlai's words were met with repeated enthusiastic applause from Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: Prime Minister Sihanouk, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Indian Ambassador to China, Parthasarathi, unanimously congratulated the deep friendship between Cambodia, China, and India, and celebrated the new victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence at a reception tonight.

Tonight's reception was hosted by Ambassador Parthasarathi to welcome the distinguished Cambodian guest's visit to China. In his speech at the reception, Prime Minister Sihanouk said that the Royal Government and people of Cambodia are willing to be friendly with all countries that sincerely seek peace, without distinction of nationality or political system; and are willing to get along with the two major Asian countries, India and China, as brothers.

Prime Minister Sihanouk said: "We can now trust the friendship of India and China. Based on this friendship, we look forward to the future with full confidence. The fact that some major powers do not understand or recognize our sincerity is no longer so important to us now. We are on the right path, and even if there are many difficulties along the way, we will eventually find peace and prosperity."

The Prime Minister recalled his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Nehru twelve days ago. He particularly pointed out: "In terms of foreign policy, Cambodia's position is very close to that of India. Both of our countries have accepted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and do not participate in any military alliances."

In his speech, Prime Minister Sihanouk praised India's peaceful policies and expressed satisfaction with Ambassador Parthasarathi's fair stance during his tenure as Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Cambodia, which oversees the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and praised the work of the Indian representatives participating in the commission. The Prime Minister said that the sincerity of the Indian representatives "as witnesses is unquestionable, and when our country was invaded by certain neighboring countries and border incidents occurred, they played a very beneficial role in judging right and wrong. Their beneficial role has been proven once again in the recent serious invasion incident."

Prime Minister Sihanouk said: "We insist that there should be an international agency with full functions to continue to remain in our country in order to fairly resolve the dispute between our country and South Vietnam. It is often said that since Cambodia has fulfilled the Geneva Accords, the commission no longer has any reason to exist in our country. But it should be remembered that while Cambodia has strictly complied with the Geneva Accords, Vietnam has not been reunified as stipulated, and the difficult problems we face are precisely the result of this situation."

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech at the reception: "The close unity and cooperation of Asian and African countries has become an extremely important factor in maintaining world peace." He said: "Cambodia, India, and China are all peace-loving countries. The governments and peoples of the three countries have been making unremitting efforts to maintain peace in Asia and the world, to advocate and promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to develop friendly cooperation between countries."

Premier Zhou said: "Cambodia, India, and China have had deep friendship and close ties since ancient times. There has never been hostility or war between each other. In recent years, the friendly relations between our three countries have been further developed. This time, His Royal Highness the Prince's visit to several Asian neighboring countries has further strengthened the traditional friendship between us."

Premier Zhou once again emphasized in his speech that the US and British invading troops must withdraw from the Middle East region and severely condemned the recent new provocative act of the US Navy entering Singapore. He also pointed out that the world's peace forces are growing unprecedentedly, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become the mainstream of international trends, which will surely overcome the aggressive forces and achieve greater victories.

Also present at tonight's reception were Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen and Shen Junru, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

The host of tonight's reception, Ambassador Parthasarathi, first delivered a speech at the beginning of the reception to welcome the distinguished Cambodian guests. He said that Cambodia, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sihanouk, has adopted a policy of peaceful neutrality. Cambodia sincerely and firmly adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Declaration. "Over the past five years, His Royal Highness the Prince has played a distinguished role in the great movement of the Asian and African people to strive for national self-determination, ease tensions, and strengthen friendly relations among the people of all countries in the world."

Ambassador Parthasarathi said, "The Indian people are pleased to see that our ancient friendly relations with the Khmer people have been restored and strengthened." He said that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the Chinese and Cambodian governments and Prime Minister Sihanouk's visit to China are of great significance. "Because it has unfolded a friendly region among the Asian people and expanded the scope of fruitful cooperation between two great countries." (Attached photo)

　　周总理表示我国人民深切关怀东南亚和平
    坚决反对美国陈兵新加坡
    西哈努克首相在印度大使招待会上谈柬中印友谊
    新华社22日讯　周恩来总理今晚在印度驻中国大使帕塔萨拉蒂为欢迎西哈努克首相而举行的招待会上说，美国海军开进新加坡，进一步威胁了东南亚地区的和平，中国人民表示坚决反对。
    周总理在谈到中东局势时特别强调地说：“应该引起我们严重注意的是，最近美国海军又开入了新加坡，进一步威胁了东南亚地区的和平。这是美国对于世界爱好和平的国家和人民特别是对于亚洲国家和人民的新挑衅。我们对此不能不表示坚决的反对。”
    周总理再一次指出：“目前中东局势仍然处于危险之中，我们对此不能不表示严重的关切。尼赫鲁总理最近一再明确地提出，美英军队必须立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出，反对派联合国部队到那个地区去。我们完全同意尼赫鲁总理的意见，并且认为这是解决中东危机的正确途径。”
    周恩来总理满怀信心地说：“今天的国际和平力量已经空前强大，印度尼赫鲁总理、缅甸吴努总理和中国的总理代表三国政府所共同倡导的、并且得到西哈努克亲王坚决支持的和平共处五项原则代表着国际趋势的主流，它一定能够战胜一切破坏和平和破坏各国关系的侵略势力而取得更大的胜利。”
    周恩来总理的这些话，博得了出席招待会的中外人士一次又一次的热烈掌声。
    新华社22日讯　西哈努克首相、周恩来总理和印度驻华大使帕塔萨拉蒂今晚在一次招待会上一致祝贺柬、中、印三国的深厚友谊，祝贺和平共处五项原则的新胜利。
    今晚的招待会是帕塔萨拉蒂大使为欢迎柬埔寨贵宾访问中国而举行的。西哈努克首相在招待会上的讲话中说，柬埔寨王国政府和人民愿意同一切真诚地要求和平的国家友好相处，没有民族和政治制度的区分；愿意同亚洲两个大国即印度和中国兄弟般地相处。
    西哈努克首相说：“我们现在已经可以信赖印度和中国的友谊。在这种友谊的基础上，我们以充分的信心瞻望着将来。有些大国不了解或者不承认我们的诚意，这一点现在对我们已经不那么重要了。我们走的是正确的道路，即使途中有许多困难，最后我们一定会找到和平和繁荣。
    首相回述了十二天以前他同印度尼赫鲁总理会见的情况。他特别指出：“就外交政策而言，柬埔寨的立场和印度是非常相近的。我们两国都接受了和平共处五项原则，并且都不参加任何军事同盟。”
    西哈努克首相在讲话中赞扬了印度所执行的和平政策，对帕塔萨拉蒂大使在担任为监督执行日内瓦协议的柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会主席期间的公正立场表示满意，并且称赞了参加这个委员会的印度代表的工作。首相说，印度代表“作为证人的诚意是无可置疑的，当我国受到某些邻邦的侵犯而发生边境事件时，他们在判断是非中起了很有益的作用。他们的有益作用在最近发生严重侵略事件的时候得到了又一次证明。”
    西哈努克首相说：“我们坚持应该有一个具有充分职能的国际机构继续留在我国以便公正地解决我国和南越之间的争端。常常有人说，既然柬埔寨已经履行了日内瓦协议，委员会就不再有理由在我国存在了。但是应该记住，柬埔寨固然已经严格遵守了日内瓦协议，越南却并没有按照规定获得重新统一，而我们所面临的令人为难的问题正是这种局面所造成的结果。”
    周恩来总理在招待会上的讲话中指出：“亚非国家的紧密团结和合作，已经成为维护世界和平的一个极为重要的因素。”他说：“柬埔寨、印度和中国都是爱好和平的国家。三国政府和人民一直为维护亚洲和世界的和平，为倡导和推广和平共处五项原则，为发展各国间的友好合作进行不懈的努力。”
    周总理说：“柬埔寨、印度和中国三国自古以来就存在着深厚的友谊和密切的联系，彼此之间从来没有进行敌视或者发生战争。近年来我们三国之间的友好关系又有了新的发展。这次亲王殿下出国访问几个亚洲的邻邦，进一步加强了我们之间的传统友谊。”
    周总理在讲话中再一次强调指出美英侵略军队必须从中近东地区撤退，严厉谴责最近美国海军开进新加坡的新的挑衅行为。他并且指出，世界和平力量正空前壮大，和平共处五项原则已经成为国际趋势的主流，它一定能够战胜侵略势力而取得更大的胜利。
    出席今晚招待会的，还有贺龙、陈毅副总理，李济深、沈钧儒副委员长，外交部章汉夫、罗贵波副部长等以及各国驻华使节。
    今晚招待会的主人——帕塔萨拉蒂大使在招待会开始时首先致词欢迎柬埔寨贵宾。他说，柬埔寨在西哈努克首相的领导下，采取了和平中立的政策。柬埔寨热诚和坚定地奉行着和平共处的五项原则以及万隆宣言。“过去五年来，亲王殿下在亚非人民争取民族自决、缓和紧张局势以及为加强世界各国人民之间的友好关系的伟大运动中，起了一个卓越的作用。”
    帕塔萨拉蒂大使说，“印度人民满意地看到，我们与高棉人民的古老友好关系，已得到恢复和加强。”他说，中柬两国政府建立正式外交关系和西哈努克首相访问中国这两件事具有重大意义。“因为它在亚洲人民中间展开了友好地区，并且扩大了两个伟大国家之间的有成效的合作范围。”（附图片）
