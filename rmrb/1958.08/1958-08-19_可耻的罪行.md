　　On August 8, the Albanian government sent a note to the Yugoslav government, strongly protesting the crime of the Yugoslav authorities in killing Albanian citizen Hasan Spata. Spata, holding a formal Albanian passport and a Yugoslav transit visa, passed through Yugoslavia at the end of May in preparation to return home. On the evening of May 27, he was secretly kidnapped by the Yugoslav authorities. Despite repeated solemn protests from the Albanian government, Yugoslavia secretly murdered Spata on August 7. This is a shameful crime, and the Yugoslav authorities have completely violated the basic principles of international law and human morality!
　　The Yugoslav authorities' murder of Spata is not an isolated incident; it is a blatant manifestation of Yugoslavia's policy of hostility towards Albania. Materials revealed by Albania prove that from before Albania's liberation until today, the Yugoslav leadership has been openly and rudely interfering in Albania. On the one hand, they have exhausted every means to try to export the so-called "Yugoslav line" to Albania, thereby turning Albania's Marxist-Leninist party into an opportunist party; on the other hand, they have infringed upon Albania's independence and freedom, wanting to turn Albania into Yugoslavia's "Seventh Republic." When Albania resolutely resisted this sinister behavior of Yugoslavia and carried out an irreconcilable struggle against Yugoslav chauvinists and revisionists, Tito's followers regarded Albania as a thorn in their side. They seize every opportunity to vent their hatred for Albania, and the murder of Spata is the best proof of this.
　　The reasons for the Yugoslav authorities' murder of Spata are also inextricably linked to dirty US dollars. According to the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice," the reason Yugoslavia killed Spata was that for many years he had traveled to the "shelters" of American imperialism in Western Europe, acting as a US spy. This time, when he learned of the Albanian People's Assembly's amnesty decree and decided to return home, the American intelligence agencies tried every possible means to prevent him from returning, but were unsuccessful. Today, the Yugoslav authorities have "successfully" completed the criminal task that the American intelligence agencies failed to complete.
　　Not only Albanian citizens have been murdered by the Yugoslav secret police, but, according to a recent report in the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda," the Yugoslav authorities also unreasonably persecuted Soviet citizen Polyakova, who went to Yugoslavia to visit relatives. Polyakova went to Yugoslavia from the Soviet Union in January of this year to visit her father. When she was preparing to return home in March, she was illegally arrested and interrogated by the Yugoslav police authorities, who threatened to keep her in Yugoslavia. Later, after Polyakova's repeated protests, the Yugoslav police authorities released her. Upon her release, they still wanted her to stay in Yugoslavia and told her not to tell anyone about her experiences in Yugoslavia.
　　These shameful crimes of the Yugoslav authorities are outrageous. These actions once again expose their true colors as bourgeois chauvinists.

　　可耻的罪行
　　本报评论员
    阿尔巴尼亚政府本月8日向南斯拉夫政府发出照会，强硬抗议南斯拉夫当局杀害阿尔巴尼亚公民哈桑·斯帕塔的罪行。斯帕塔在今年5月底持有阿尔巴尼亚正式护照和南斯拉夫的过境签证路过南斯拉夫准备返国时，在5月27日晚上被南斯拉夫当局秘密绑架，虽经阿尔巴尼亚政府一再提出严正抗议，但是，南斯拉夫竟在本月7日暗中将斯帕塔杀害。这是一种可耻的罪行，南斯拉夫当局完全违背了国际法的基本原则和人类的道德！
    南斯拉夫当局杀害斯帕塔事件并不是一个孤立的事件，它是南斯拉夫敌视阿尔巴尼亚的政策的一个露骨的表现。阿尔巴尼亚所揭露的材料证明，从阿尔巴尼亚解放前直到今天，南斯拉夫领导集团一直对阿尔巴尼亚进行公开的粗暴的干涉。他们一方面用尽一切手段企图向阿尔巴尼亚输出所谓“南斯拉夫路线”，从而把阿尔巴尼亚的马克思列宁主义政党变成一个机会主义的政党；一方面侵犯阿尔巴尼亚的独立和自由，想把阿尔巴尼亚变成南斯拉夫的
  “第七共和国”。当阿尔巴尼亚坚决反抗南斯拉夫的这种险恶的行为并且对南斯拉夫沙文主义和修正主义者进行不调和的斗争时，铁托分子就将阿尔巴尼亚看作眼中钉。他们利用一切机会发泄对阿尔巴尼亚的仇恨，杀害斯帕塔事件正是一个最好的证明。
    南斯拉夫当局杀害斯帕塔的原因还同肮脏的美元发生不可告人的联系。据阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”揭露，南斯拉夫所以要杀害斯帕塔，是因为他以前多年来曾来往于美帝国主义在西欧的“收容所”，充当美国的间谍，这次当他得悉阿尔巴尼亚人民议会的大赦令后决定回国时，美国特务机关想尽一切方法来阻挠他返国，都没有成功。今天，南斯拉夫当局是“成功”地完成美国特务机关未完成的罪恶勾当了。
    不仅阿尔巴尼亚公民受到南斯拉夫秘密警察的杀害，据最近苏联“共青团真理报”揭露，南斯拉夫当局也无理地迫害了前往南斯拉夫探亲的苏联女公民波尔雅科娃。波尔雅科娃今年1月从苏联去南斯拉夫探望她的父亲，当她3月间准备返国时，却被南斯拉夫警察当局非法逮捕和审问，并威胁着要她留在南斯拉夫。后来经过波尔雅科娃多次抗议，南斯拉夫警察当局才释放了她。在释放时，他们仍然要她留在南斯拉夫，并且要她不要对任何人谈出她在南斯拉夫的遭遇。
    南斯拉夫当局的这些可耻的罪行，是令人愤慨的。这些行为再一次暴露了他们的资产阶级沙文主义的真面目。
