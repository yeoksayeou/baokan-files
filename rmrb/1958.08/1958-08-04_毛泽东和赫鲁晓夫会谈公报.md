From July 31 to August 3, 1958, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, held talks in Beijing.

The Chinese side participating in the talks included:
	Premier of the State Council, Zhou Enlai,
	Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, Marshal Peng Dehuai,
	Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Yi,
	Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Jiaxiang.

The Soviet side participating in the talks included:
	Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal R. Ya. Malinovsky,
	Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, V.V. Kuznetsov,
	Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, B.N. Ponomarev.

The two sides conducted a comprehensive discussion in an extremely sincere and cordial atmosphere on pressing and major issues in the current international situation, on further strengthening the relations of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union, and on the joint struggle to strive for a peaceful resolution of international issues and to safeguard world peace, and reached completely unanimous opinions.

The two sides unanimously believe that the Soviet Union and China, together with other countries of the socialist camp and all peace-loving countries and people, have made significant achievements in the struggle to strive for relaxation of international tensions and to safeguard peace. The peaceful policies of China and the Soviet Union have gained increasingly broad sympathy and support from the people of all countries in the world. India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, and other Asian, African, American, and European countries and people who advocate peaceful coexistence are playing an increasingly important role in consolidating peace. The forces of peace have grown unprecedentedly.

Contrary to this distinct and unwavering policy, which is in line with the vital interests of our two countries and the people of all countries in the world, the imperialist aggressive groups headed by the US monopoly groups have consistently opposed peaceful coexistence and cooperation, stubbornly refused to relax international tensions, obstructed summit conferences of major powers, and intensified preparations for new wars, threatening peace and the security of the people of all countries. These imperialist forces are the enemies of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. They have cobbled together aggressive military-political blocs, spread their military bases around the world, and increasingly interfered crudely in the internal affairs of other countries.

Recently, the armed aggression by the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan and their threat of force against the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic have greatly aggravated the tense situation in the Middle East and Near East, made the danger of war even more serious, and aroused universal protests and condemnations from the people of all countries in the world.

China and the Soviet Union severely condemn the United States and Britain for their crude acts of aggression in the Middle East and Near East, firmly advocate the immediate convocation of a summit conference of major powers to discuss the situation in the Middle East and Near East, and firmly demand that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

China and the Soviet Union firmly support the just struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq, and other Arab countries, and firmly support the national independence movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Events in the Middle East and Near East and other parts of the world prove that the national liberation movement is an irresistible trend, the colonial era is gone forever, and any attempt to maintain and restore colonial rule that runs counter to the historical trend is a danger to the cause of peace and is doomed to failure.

The two sides fully exchanged views on a series of major issues facing the two countries in Asia and Europe under the current international situation, and reached a completely unanimous agreement on the measures to be taken to oppose aggression and safeguard peace.

China and the Soviet Union will do everything possible to continue to work for relaxation of international tensions and to prevent new war disasters. The two sides reiterate that the right of the people of all countries to choose their own socio-political system should be respected, that countries with different social systems must practice peaceful coexistence in accordance with the well-known Five Principles widely recognized internationally, that all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiations, and that the development of economic and cultural relations between countries based on mutual benefit and peaceful competition should be encouraged. Such relations can enhance mutual understanding among the people of all countries and are fully in line with the purpose of relaxing international tensions and safeguarding peace.

In order to maintain and consolidate peace, the primary task at present is to reach agreement among nations on disarmament, cessation of testing and prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, abolition of all military blocs and all military bases established in foreign countries, and conclusion of peace and collective security treaties.

However, whether war can be avoided cannot depend solely on the good wishes of peace-loving people and their unilateral efforts. The aggressive groups of Western powers have so far refused to take any serious steps to maintain peace, but instead have unscrupulously aggravated international tensions, bringing humanity to the brink of war disaster. However, they should know that if the imperialist war maniacs dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people will surely unite closely, thoroughly eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for lasting world peace.

The two sides note with extreme satisfaction that fraternal friendship, all-round cooperation, and mutual assistance relations are developing smoothly and being consolidated day by day between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, between the Chinese Government and the Soviet Government, and between our two peoples. The economies of both countries are developing by leaps and bounds. The strength of both countries is growing day by day. The unity and cooperation between the two countries, built on the basis of complete equality and comradely mutual assistance, have great vitality. This unity and cooperation are not only conducive to the rapid advance of the two countries along the road of socialism and communism, but also conducive to strengthening the strength of the entire socialist camp.

The two sides decided to continue to fully develop all-round cooperation between the two countries, further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, further strengthen unity with all peace-loving countries and people, and reached complete agreement on all the issues discussed.

The two sides have a completely unanimous assessment of the tasks facing the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The unshakable unity between these two Marxist-Leninist parties will always be a reliable guarantee for the victory of our common cause.

The Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will spare no effort to defend this sacred unity, safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, defend the principles of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, and wage an uncompromising struggle against revisionism, the main danger in the communist movement – a revisionism that is clearly manifested in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The two sides expressed their full belief that the ever-growing forces of peace and the forces of socialism will surely be able to overcome all obstacles on the road forward and achieve great victories.

    毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报
    从1958年7月31日到8月3日，中国共产党中央委员会主席、中华人民共和国主席毛泽东和苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫，在北京举行了会谈。
    中国方面参加会谈的有：国务院总理周恩来，
    国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅，
    国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅，
    中共中央书记处书记王稼祥。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有：苏联国防部长罗·雅·马利诺夫斯基元帅，
    苏联代理外交部长瓦·瓦·库兹涅佐夫，
    苏联共产党中央委员鲍·尼·波诺马烈夫。
    会谈双方在极其诚恳、亲切的气氛中，就目前国际形势中迫切和重大的问题，进一步加强中苏之间友好、同盟、互助关系的问题和为争取和平解决国际问题、维护世界和平而进行共同奋斗的问题，进行了全面的讨论，并且取得了完全一致的意见。
    双方一致认为，苏联和中国同社会主义阵营其他各国以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，在争取和缓国际紧张局势和维护和平的斗争中，已经取得重大的成就。中苏两国的和平政策得到了世界各国人民日益广泛的同情和支持。印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国以及其他主张和平共处的亚洲、非洲、美洲、欧洲的国家和人民，对于巩固和平起着日益重大的作用。和平力量已经有了空前的增长。
    同这种符合我们两国和世界各国人民的切身利益的、鲜明的坚定不移的政策相反，以美国垄断集团为首的帝国主义侵略集团一直反对和平共处和合作，顽固地拒绝和缓国际紧张局势，阻挠大国政府首脑会议，并且加紧准备新的战争，威胁和平和各国人民的安全。这些帝国主义势力是和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的敌人，它们拼凑侵略性的军事政治集团，在世界上布满自己的军事基地，越来越粗暴地干涉他国的内政。
    最近，美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略和他们对于伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国的武力威胁，大大加剧了中近东地区的紧张局势，使战争危险更加严重，引起了世界各国人民普遍的抗议和谴责。
    中苏两国严厉谴责美国和英国在中近东地区的粗暴侵略行为，坚决主张立即召开大国政府首脑会议讨论中近东局势，并且坚决要求美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出他们的军队。
    中苏两国坚决支持阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动。中近东地区和世界其他地区的事件证明，民族解放运动是不可抗拒的潮流，殖民主义时代已经一去不复返了，任何维持和恢复违背历史潮流的殖民统治的企图都是危害和平事业，都是注定要失败的。
    双方就目前国际形势下两国所面临的在亚洲方面和欧洲方面的一系列重大问题充分地交换了意见，并且对于反对侵略和维护和平所应采取的措施达成了完全一致的协议。
    中苏两国将竭尽一切可能，继续为和缓国际紧张局势、防止新的战争灾难而努力。双方重申：各国人民选择自己的社会政治制度的权利应当得到尊重，不同社会制度的国家必须按照得到国际上广泛承认的著名的五项原则实行和平共处，一切国际争端应当通过和平谈判来解决，在互利和和平竞赛的基础上发展各国之间的经济和文化关系应当受到鼓励，这种关系能够增进各国人民之间的相互了解，完全符合于和缓国际紧张局势和维护和平的目的。
    为了维护和巩固和平，目前的首要任务是要在各国间就裁减军备、停止试验和禁止使用原子武器和氢武器、取消一切军事集团和在外国设置的一切军事基地、缔结和平和集体安全公约，达成协议。
    但是，战争能否避免，不能仅靠爱好和平人民的善良愿望和他们单方面的努力。西方大国的侵略集团至今拒绝对于维护和平采取任何认真的步骤，反而肆无忌惮地加剧国际紧张局势，使人类濒于战争灾难的边缘。但是，他们应当知道，如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。
    双方极其满意地指出，在中国共产党和苏联共产党之间、在中国政府和苏联政府之间、在我们两国人民之间，正在顺利地发展着和日益巩固着兄弟般的友好、全面合作和互助的关系。两国的经济都在飞跃发展。两国的力量日益强大。两国建立在完全平等和同志般互助的基础上的团结和合作具有伟大的生命力，这种团结和合作不仅有利于两国沿着社会主义和共产主义道路迅速前进，而且有利于加强整个社会主义阵营的力量。
    双方决定继续全力发展两国之间的全面合作，进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结，进一步加强同一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，并且对于所讨论的一切问题达成了完全的协议。
    双方对于中国共产党和苏联共产党所共同面临的任务的估计完全一致，这两个马克思列宁主义的政党之间的不可动摇的团结永远是我们的共同事业胜利的可靠保证。
    中国共产党和苏联共产党将不遗余力地捍卫这种神圣的团结，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁，捍卫各国共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言的原则，同共产主义运动中的主要危险修正主义——这种修正主义明显地表现在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领中——进行毫不调和的斗争。
    双方表示完全相信，日益壮大的和平力量和社会主义力量，一定能够战胜前进道路上的一切障碍而取得伟大的胜利。
    中国共产党中央委员会主席
    中华人民共和国主席
            毛泽东
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记
