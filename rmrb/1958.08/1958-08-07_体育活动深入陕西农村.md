Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th: Sports activities are developing in the rural areas of Shaanxi Province amidst the Great Leap Forward. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Dali, Yan'an, Lantian, and Ankang, over the past four to five months, more than 1,000 grassroots sports associations have been established at the township and commune levels. More than 2,300 new basketball courts and various sports fields have been built, and more than 50% of the farmers regularly participate in sports activities. In Dali County alone, there are more than 600 basketball courts, with an average of eight courts per commune. Each township and commune has its own basketball team, including seven women's teams. The county also has twelve rural volleyball teams and five rural football teams. Many people participate in calisthenics, high jump, long jump, long-distance running, martial arts, tug-of-war, and walking races. In Yan'an County, sports associations were established in all 464 communes in the county within 20 days, and more than 200 new sports venues were built. They developed various sports activities according to local conditions. In areas where wood was readily available, they built their own basketball hoops and parallel bar frames to carry out basketball and parallel bar activities. In areas where wood was scarce, they engaged in stone lifting, tug-of-war, high jump, and long jump. By the end of July, the county had held three sports competitions with more than 300 farmers participating. Almost every township and commune in the county has sports activities every day.

Various localities utilize production gaps to conduct exercises, based on agricultural production activities. After the summer harvest in Ankang County this year, mass sports activities have become more active. Zhangtan and other districts hold farmers' sports meets every month. Since the beginning of this year, Shuangdi Agricultural Cooperative has participated in 36 basketball games and 20 tug-of-war competitions. Jiang Yuan Gui, the director of this cooperative, recently participated in the Ankang Special District sports meet and put the sixteen-pound shot put more than ten meters away, reaching the standard of a third-level athlete.

The widespread and in-depth development of rural sports activities has gradually strengthened the people's physique and labor discipline, increased labor attendance rates, and promoted the spirit of collectivism. In Honghua Cooperative, Dazhai Township, Lantian County, more than 70 sports activists have been energetic and never absent from work during this year's Great Leap Forward in production. In the construction of a dam project in Duanjiayuan, Dali County, four shock brigades composed of more than 200 athletes did more and better earthwork.

    体育活动深入陕西农村
    据新华社西安6日电　陕西省各地农村在大跃进中开展体育活动。仅据大荔、延安、蓝田、安康等七个县的不完全统计，最近四、五个月来共建立起乡、社基层体育协会一千多个，新建篮球场和各种运动场地两千三百多个，占总人数50％强的农民经常参加了体育活动。大荔县就有六百多个篮球场，每社平均有八个球场，各乡各社都有自己的篮球代表队，其中有七个女子代表队。全县还有十二个农村排球队、五个农村足球队。许多人都参加了广播体操、跳高、跳远、长跑、武术、拔河、竞走等体育活动。延安县在二十天内，就在全县四百六十四个社里建立了体育协会，新建运动场地二百多处。他们因地制宜的开展了各种体育活动、木材方便的地区自建篮球架、单双杠架、开展篮球和单双杠活动；木材缺乏的地区搞石锁、拔河、跳高、跳远等运动项目。全县到7月底已举行了有三百多农民参加的运动竞赛会三次。全县乡乡社社几乎每天都有体育活动。
    各地根据农业生产活动情况，分别利用生产空隙时间进行锻炼。安康县今年夏季丰收后，群众体育运动更活跃，张滩等区每个月都举行了农民运动会。双堤农业社今年以来参加篮球比赛达三十六次，拔河二十次。这个社社主任江元贵不久前，在参加安康专区运动会上把十六磅的铅球推向十公尺以外，达到了三级运动员的标准。
    农村体育活动的广泛深入开展，逐渐增强了人民体质和劳动纪律，提高了劳动出勤率，发扬了集体主义精神。蓝田县大寨乡红花社七十多个体育积极分子在今年生产大跃进中，精力旺盛，从无一人缺勤。大荔县段家塬在修筑大坝工程中，由二百多名运动员组成的四个突击队做的土方又多又好。
