Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 13th: A tragic incident occurred in Ahmedabad, Bombay State, India, where the public held demonstrations on the 12th to protest the authorities' dispatch of police to remove a martyrs' memorial they had erected in the city. Police opened fire on the demonstrators, and a 24-hour curfew has been in effect since the evening of the 12th. According to the Press Trust of India, clashes between citizens and police continued today. Police opened fire again in the afternoon, killing one person.

According to a report in the "Times of India" on the 13th, local police opened fire three times on the afternoon of the 12th, wounding seven people. In thirty-five districts of the city, police used iron-clad batons to beat demonstrators and used more than one hundred tear gas canisters. More than three hundred people were arrested.

The people of this major city in the Gujarati-speaking region of Bombay State erected the martyrs' memorial on August 8th to commemorate those killed by police gunfire during demonstrations held on August 8, 1956, to protest the government's establishment of a Bombay State composed of a mixture of Marathi and Gujarati-speaking regions. The Political Bureau of the Indian Communist Party issued a statement at the time opposing the government's decision to establish a bilingual Bombay State. The Ahmedabad City Congress Committee also requested the Congress Working Committee to cancel this decision. The establishment of a single Gujarati state is a universal demand of the Gujarati people.

The Maha Gujarat People's Association has called on the people of the Gujarati-speaking region to designate August 14th as a day of protest. The chairman of this association, Indulal Yagnik, a member of the World Peace Council, has been on a seven-day hunger strike since the 12th to protest the authorities' actions.

Members of Parliament from opposition parties such as the Indian Communist Party and the People's Socialist Party walked out of the Lok Sabha (People's Assembly) meeting this morning to pay their respects to the martyrs of Ahmedabad and to express their sympathy for those shot by police there yesterday.

Before they walked out, the members had moved for adjournment ten times, demanding a discussion of the situation in Ahmedabad, but each time they were rejected by the Speaker. Home Minister Pant insisted that the "riotous behavior" of the masses should be "suppressed."

　　印度阿麦达巴市发生惨案
　　警察开枪杀伤示威群众
    新华社新德里13日电　印度孟买邦阿麦达巴市人民群众在12日举行示威，抗议当局派警察移走他们在市内树立的一个烈士纪念碑。警察向示威群众开枪，并且从12日晚间开始实行二十四小时的戒严。据印度报业托辣斯报道，市民同警察今天继续发生冲突。警察在下午又一次开枪，打死一人。
    据“印度时报”13日报道，当地警察在12日下午曾经三次开枪，打伤了七人，在市内的三十五个地区，警察用包铁的警棍殴打示威群众，并且使用了一百多枚催泪弹，有三百多人被捕。
    孟买邦古吉拉特语地区的这个主要城市的人民在8日树立烈士纪念碑，纪念1956年8月8日当地人民为了抗议政府成立一个由马拉提语地区和古吉拉特语地区混合组成的孟买邦而举行示威游行时，被警察开枪打死的人。印度共产党政治局当时曾经发表声明表示反对政府关于成立孟买双语言邦的决定。阿麦达巴市国大党委员会也曾经要求国大党工作委员会取消这一决定。成立单一的古吉拉特邦是古吉拉特人的普遍要求。
    大古吉拉特人民协会号召古吉拉特语地区的人民把8月14日定为抗议日。这个协会的主席、世界和平理事会理事印杜拉尔·雅尼克从12日起绝食七天来抗议当局的行动。
    印度共产党、人民社会党等反对党国会议员今天上午退出了国会人民院会议会场，以表示对阿麦达巴的烈士的敬意和对昨天在那里遭到警察枪击的人们的同情。
    在他们退出会场以前，议员们曾经十次提出休会动议，要求讨论阿麦达巴的局势，但是每次都遭到议长的拒绝。内政部长潘特坚决认为，群众的“暴动行为”应该“遭到镇压”。
