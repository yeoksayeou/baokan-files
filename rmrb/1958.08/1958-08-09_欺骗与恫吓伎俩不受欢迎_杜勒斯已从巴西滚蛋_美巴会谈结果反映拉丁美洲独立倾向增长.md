Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, July 7th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' two-day talks with Brazilian President Kubitschek and other senior Brazilian officials ended on the 6th, and Dulles departed for Washington that day.

The two countries issued a nine-point declaration after the talks. The declaration did not mention the two countries' views on the current international situation, although Dulles, in his speech at the airport upon arrival in Rio de Janeiro, had stated that he would discuss international issues with Brazilian government leaders, including the Middle East issue.

Regarding Brazil's concerns about its own economic development, the declaration only mentioned "the need to solve the problem of underdevelopment" and that the American republics should "cooperate and coordinate their efforts to develop the economies of the countries of this hemisphere." However, according to an Associated Press report from Rio de Janeiro, Dulles was "not interested" in the Brazilian Finance Minister Lopez's request for U.S. loans to help Brazil develop its oil industry, and he "very diplomatically indicated the U.S. attitude was negative." Sources say that Dulles wanted Brazil to seek private investment in the United States on this point.

The declaration reflects the desire of Latin American countries to have a greater say in international affairs. It stated that the two governments "believe that Latin America can play an important role among the countries of the world, and it is very appropriate for Latin America to participate more in clarifying the basic principles of international policy that guide the free world."

The declaration also touched on the issue of holding a summit of American countries and stated that informal meetings would be held by the foreign ministers of the relevant countries during the next session of the United Nations General Assembly to prepare for it.

In a speech in Rio de Janeiro on the 6th, Dulles once again peddled his cliché of so-called "communist danger" and "indirect aggression," attempting to intimidate Latin American countries. He said that the purpose of his visit was to "discuss how to dispel the growing clouds that are now darkening the eastern horizon and may darken the whole world," "International communism is now attempting to dominate the world... through direct and indirect aggression." However, as everyone knows, the recent actions of the United States in some Latin American countries and its armed aggression against Middle Eastern countries have once again irrefutably proven that Dulles' cliché is worthless.

    欺骗与恫吓伎俩不受欢迎
    杜勒斯已从巴西滚蛋
    美巴会谈结果反映拉丁美洲独立倾向增长
    新华社7日讯  里约热内卢消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在和巴西总统库比契克以及其他巴西高级官员举行的两天会谈在6日结束，杜勒斯已经在当天动身回华盛顿。
    两国在会谈后发表了一项九点宣言。宣言中没有提到两国对当前国际局势的看法，虽然杜勒斯在到达里约热内卢时在机场发表的谈话中，曾经谈到他将同巴西政府领导人讨论国际局势问题，其中包括中东问题。
    对于巴西所关心的本国经济的发展问题，宣言中只提到“需要解决不发达的问题”和美洲各共和国要“互相配合地和协调地努力发展本半球国家的经济”。但是，据美联社从里约热内卢发出的一条消息说，杜勒斯对巴西财政部长洛佩兹提出的要美国提供贷款帮助巴西开发石油一事并“不感兴趣”，他“非常圆滑地表示美国的态度是否定的”。有消息说，在这一点上杜勒斯要巴西到美国寻求私人投资。
    宣言反映了拉丁美洲国家要求在国际事务中有更大的发言权。它说，两国政府“认为拉丁美洲可以在世界各国中起重要的作用，拉丁美洲更多地参加指导自由世界的国际政策基本方针的阐明工作是非常适宜的”。
    宣言还谈到举行美洲国家首脑会议的问题，并且说将在联合国大会下届会议期间由有关各国外长举行非正式会议进行筹备。
    杜勒斯6日在里约热内卢发表的一篇演说中，再一次贩卖他的所谓“共产主义危险”和“间接侵略”的滥调，他企图借此来恫吓拉丁美洲国家。他说，他这次访问的目的是“商讨如何驱散现在遮黑了东边天际并且可能遮暗全世界的越来越大的阴云”，“现在企图统治世界的是国际共产主义……通过直接和间接的侵略”。可是，谁都知道，美国最近在拉丁美洲一些国家的行动以及它对中近东国家的武装侵略，已经再一次无可辩驳地证明，杜勒斯这种滥调已经一钱不值了。
