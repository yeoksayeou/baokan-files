　　Celebrating the Opening of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway
　　Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ha Feng'a
　　The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is open to traffic. This is a great joyful event for the people of the whole country.
　　The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway runs across northern China, connecting the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Gansu Province. Connected to the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, it is a major artery in northern China and an essential component of the national railway network. The opening of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will not only greatly promote the socialist construction of the areas along the line, but also greatly strengthen the unity of the socialist camp because it connects the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which links China and the Soviet Union, with major domestic and international railways.
　　The benefits that the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway brings to the people of Inner Mongolia are immeasurable. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is causing tremendous changes in transportation in western Inner Mongolia. The grain of the Hetao area is no longer at risk of spoilage, and the salt and livestock products of Alxa can be sold throughout the country. The rich iron ore, coalfields, and various rare metals that have been dormant underground in these areas for thousands of years will be fully exploited. Local industries will flourish everywhere in western Inner Mongolia.
　　The Railway Corps is an important component of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Since its establishment, the Railway Corps has been a heroic fighting force and a heroic construction force. In wartime, the Railway Corps repaired railways, powerfully coordinating with the Liberation War. In peacetime, the Railway Corps has traveled throughout the north and south of the country, repairing and building railways in all directions, promoting the socialist construction of the motherland.
　　In the process of building the northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, the Railway Corps fully demonstrated the noble qualities of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In Inner Mongolia, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway had to cross the Yellow River twice and pass over the four major canals of the Hetao seven times, and also had to pass through the sparsely populated desert area of the Ordos Plateau. The difficulties in building the road were great. However, the Railway Corps and all the road-building employees of the First and Third Engineering Bureaus of the Ministry of Railways, regardless of the severe cold and hot weather, and regardless of the very difficult conditions of material supply, always launched a great march to conquer nature with a heroic and tenacious fighting spirit. They overcame all kinds of difficulties and ensured that the arduous road-building tasks of each stage were completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. Especially under the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, they were even more inspired by the great spirit of "kicking the Yellow River to flow backwards and using Mount Tai as a pillow," spurred on greater efforts, continuously innovated technology, and created miracles repeatedly with the momentum of moving mountains and overturning seas, and finally completed the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway ahead of schedule.
　　The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has been built, and the meritorious Railway Corps heroes will board the first victorious train, sing triumphant songs, and rush to the new battlefront to strive to complete 10,000 kilometers of railway and accelerate the glorious task of socialist construction of the motherland. Although you have left Inner Mongolia, the railway you built remains in Inner Mongolia, and like a red line, it will forever connect the hearts of the people of Inner Mongolia with your hearts. With the socialist industrialization of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the happy life of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia will continue to improve. Whenever people receive the indescribable benefits brought by the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, they will always and everywhere think of the road builders—the heroic Railway Corps, and this friendship will last forever!
　　Thank you, and wish you eternal victory!
　　Railway heroes have made great achievements, building the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway and creating miracles;
　　The revolutionary enthusiasm is soaring, and red flags are flying across the Yellow River three times.
　　The northern artery has been opened, and the motherland's landscape is even more magnificent;
　　The benefits to the people are difficult to describe, and the sound of praise will be passed down for thousands of years.

    欢呼包兰铁路通车
    内蒙古自治区副主席　哈丰阿
    包兰铁路通车了。这是全国人民的一件大喜事。
    包兰铁路横贯在祖国的北方，连结内蒙古自治区、宁夏回族自治区和甘肃省，和兰新铁路衔接起来，它是祖国北方的大动脉，是全国铁路网最重要的构成部分。包兰铁路的通车，不仅大大促进沿线地区的社会主义建设，而且由于它把连结中苏两国的兰新铁路同国内、国际的各大铁路都能连结起来，这将大大加强社会主义阵营的团结。
    包兰铁路的通车，给内蒙古人民带来的好处，是无法估价的。包兰铁路使内蒙古西部的交通发生着巨大变化。河套粮食已经没有粮食霉烂之患，阿拉善食盐和畜产品能畅销各地；在这些地区地下沉睡千万年的丰富的铁矿、煤田以及各种稀有金属，将被充分开发利用。内蒙古西部地区的地方工业将遍地开花。
    铁道兵是中国人民解放军的重要组成部分。铁道兵自从建立以来，就是一支英雄的战斗部队，也是一支英雄的建设部队。在战时，铁道兵抢修铁路，有力地配合了解放战争，在建设时期，铁道兵走遍祖国南北，修复和修建了四通八达的铁路，促进祖国社会主义建设。
    在修建包兰铁路北段的过程中，铁道兵充分显示了中国人民解放军的崇高品质。在内蒙古境内，包兰铁路要两跨黄河，七过河套四大干渠，并且要穿过鄂尔多斯高原以及人烟稀少的沙漠地带，修路中的困难是很大的。但是，铁道兵及铁道部第一、三工程局全体筑路员工，无论在严寒和酷热的气候里，也无论在物资供应非常困难的条件下，始终以英勇顽强的战斗精神，展开了征服自然的大进军。他们克服了种种困难，而保证了每一个阶段的繁重的筑路任务如期或者提前完成。特别是在全国大跃进形势下，他们更以“脚踏黄河水倒流，搬倒泰山当枕头”的伟大气魄，鼓起更大干劲，不断革新技术，以移山倒海之势，屡创奇迹，终于提前建成了包兰铁路。
    包兰铁路修通了，劳苦功高的铁道兵英雄们将登上第一列胜利列车，高奏凯歌，奔向新的战斗前线，为完成一万公里铁路，加速祖国社会主义建设的光荣任务而奋斗。你们虽然离开了内蒙古，但是你们修建的铁路却留在内蒙古，并且像一条红线一样，把内蒙古人民的心和你们的心永远连结在一起。随着内蒙古自治区的社会主义工业化，内蒙古各族人民的幸福生活将不断增进，人们每逢得到包兰铁路带来的说不尽的好处，就会随时随地想到筑路人——英雄的铁道兵，而这种情谊将万古长存！
    感谢你们，祝你们永远胜利！
    铁道英雄树伟绩，修建包兰创奇迹；
    革命干劲冲霄汉，三跨黄河飘红旗。
    北方动脉已开通，祖国江山倍绮丽；
    造福人民难缕述，歌颂之声传万纪。
