　　From the Masses

　　Appropriately Relax the Limit on Insured Letter Remittances
    According to post office regulations, an insured letter can only contain a maximum of 16 yuan. If you want to send 20 yuan, you must use two envelopes. This adds trouble for both the sender and the post office staff. It is suggested to appropriately relax the limit on insured letter remittances.

    Come and Claim the Cars Quickly
    On the Tanggula Mountain section of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, there are four cars that have been parked for more than a year, and no one has come to claim them. Because these four cars have been exposed to wind and rain for a long time, they have turned from new cars into waste.

　  Empty Toothpaste Tubes Should Be Purchased
    The supply and marketing cooperatives in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, do not purchase empty toothpaste tubes that the masses bring to them, and our suggestions have not been resolved. We hope they will purchase them in order to support industry in "combating drought".

　　适当放宽保价信寄款额
    根据邮局规定，一封保价信最多寄十六元钱，如果寄二十元必须用两个信封。这样给寄款人和邮局工作人员都增加麻烦。建议适当放宽保价信寄款数额。

    赶快来领汽车
    在青藏公路的唐古拉山段，有四台汽车停放了一年多，至今没人来领。这四台汽车由于长期被风吹雨打，已经由新车变成废物。

　  应该收买空牙膏管
    辽宁省复县地区的供销合作社不收购群众送上门的空牙膏管，我们提意见也没有解决。希望他们收购，以便支援工业“抗旱”。
