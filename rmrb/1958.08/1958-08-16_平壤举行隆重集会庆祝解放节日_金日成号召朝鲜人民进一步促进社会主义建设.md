Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Korean Premier Kim Il-sung held a grand banquet tonight to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

Attending the banquet were: Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea; Vice Premiers Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Jung Joon-taek; Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, Kim Chang-man; cabinet ministers; heads of democratic political parties and social organizations; prominent figures from all walks of life; and foreign envoys stationed in Korea and foreign personnel in Korea. The delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by Major General Ding Lai-fu, was invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Kim Il-sung said in his speech at the banquet that Korea has achieved brilliant successes in the thirteen years since its liberation. He said that today the Korean people are filled with pride in their glorious struggle achievements, confidence in the future, and determination to overcome any difficulties. He said, "We must further promote socialist construction." With the support of the powerful socialist camp, the Korean people will surely achieve final victory in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of socialism. In his speech, Kim Il-sung also expressed his gratitude to the people of the Soviet Union, the people of China, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the people of all fraternal countries who actively support the struggle of the Korean people.

The banquet was held in a warm atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Pyongyang held a grand military parade and a mass parade of 300,000 people this morning to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on August 15th.

The Korean people greeted their festival in the high tide of socialist construction this year. Rows of newly built buildings in Pyongyang were hung with flags and huge slogans, reading "Ride the Chollima Horse and Advance Towards Socialism."

Korean Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Choi Yong-kun and other state leaders stood on the newly built reviewing stand made of granite and marble in Kim Il-sung Square this year to review the military parade and the marching crowds. Foreign diplomatic envoys stationed in Korea and the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by Major General Ding Lai-fu, were invited to attend the ceremony.

The military parade began at 8:00 a.m. General Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defense of Korea, reviewed the troops of various services and arms stationed on the square and delivered a speech. He said that the Republic firmly implements the policy of peaceful reunification. The Chinese People's Volunteers are withdrawing their troops, but the American aggressor troops are still unwilling to withdraw from South Korea, which has been criticized by peace-loving people all over the world. He said that the armed aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by US-British imperialism seriously threatens the peace of the Middle East and the world, and US-British troops should immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

Then, the students of the Korean People's Army Officer School and the military academies of the army, navy and air force marched past the reviewing stand with majestic steps. As the tank units, anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery units passed the stand, the bombers and fighters of the Korean People's Army Air Force flew over the square in neat formations. This army, which defeated the American aggressors in the Korean War, is now even stronger.

When the mass parade, with labor heroes and production innovators as the vanguard, entered the square, warm applause rang out in the square.

The production charts held high by the masses showed the achievements they had made in the high tide of socialist construction. By 1961, Korea's industrial output value will increase to 3.6 times that of 1956. The chart held by construction workers in Pyongyang City showed that they had built 12,000 houses in the first seven months of this year. The workers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory now produce 250,000 meters of cloth every day. Bundles of pink azaleas and countless colored flags held by the masses formed a colorful river, and the cheers of the people soared into the sky.

The parade ended at 10 o'clock.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: More than 800 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang City gathered at the Moranbong Theater tonight to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on August 15th.

Korean Premier Kim Il-sung attended the meeting, as did Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Vice Premiers Hong Myung-hee, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Jung Joon-taek, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, Kim Chang-man, as well as cabinet ministers, ministers of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, heads of democratic parties and social organizations, and senior generals of the Korean People's Army. Foreign envoys stationed in Korea and the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by Major General Ding Lai-fu, were also invited to attend the meeting.

Korean Vice Premier Kim Il delivered a report at the meeting. He first expressed his gratitude to the liberator of the Korean people—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the army. Then he narrated the victories and achievements of the Korean people in the thirteen years since liberation.

Kim Il said that the socialist construction in northern Korea has entered its highest tide, and the struggle of the Korean people, riding on the Chollima horse with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, is the most powerful guarantee for strengthening the revolutionary democratic base and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Speaking of the situation in the Middle East, Kim Il said that the Korean people will never tolerate the imperialist aggression against the Middle East by the US and Britain. The Korean people will do their best to support and support the national liberation struggle of the people of Lebanon and Jordan. US-British aggressor troops should immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. If the imperialists disregard today's reality and historical lessons and continue their aggression, they will surely suffer even more serious defeats. Kim Il then said that the Korean people continue to strongly demand that the American aggressors immediately withdraw from South Korea and that the Korean people themselves solve the Korean issue.

Kim Il condemned modern revisionism, which is concentratedly manifested in the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He said that today the international communist and workers' movement resolutely criticizes revisionism, defends the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and is more united under the banner of proletarian internationalism.

Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to Korea, Pirishenko, also spoke at the meeting.

    宴会是在热烈的气氛中进行的。
    据新华社平壤15日电　平壤市今天上午举行盛大的阅兵式和三十万人的群众游行，庆祝八·一五朝鲜解放十三周年。
    朝鲜人民今年在社会主义建设的高潮中迎接了自己的节日，平壤市新建成的一排排的大楼上悬挂着旗帜和巨幅标语，标语上写着“骑上千里马向社会主义前进”。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成和最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健等国家领导人站在金日成广场上今年用花岗石和大理石新建成的检阅台上阅兵和检阅群众游行的队伍。各国驻朝鲜的外交使节和以丁莱夫少将为首的中国人民志愿军代表团应邀参加了观礼。
    上午八时开始阅兵，朝鲜民族保卫相金光侠大将检阅了排列在广场上的各兵种部队，并发表了演说。他说，共和国坚定不移地执行和平统一的政策。中国人民志愿军正在撤军，但美国侵略军仍不肯撤出南朝鲜，受到全世界爱好和平人民的指责。他说，美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦严重威胁着中近东和世界的和平，美英军队应该立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    接着，朝鲜人民军军官学校和陆海空军军事学校的学员们踏着雄武的步伐走过检阅台前。在坦克部队、高射炮和重炮部队经过台前的时候，朝鲜人民军空军的轰炸机、歼击机排着整齐的队形飞过广场上空。这支在朝鲜战争中打垮了美国侵略者的部队现在更加坚强了。
    当以劳动英雄、生产革新者为先头部队的群众游行行列进入广场时，广场上响起了热烈的掌声。
    群众高举着的生产图表显示了他们在社会主义建设高潮中取得的成就。到1961年朝鲜的工业产值将增加到1956年的三点六倍。平壤市的建筑工人举着的图表上说明在今年头七个多月他们已建成了一万二千户住宅。平壤纺织工厂的工人们现在每天生产二十五万公尺布匹。群众手中举着的一束束粉红色的金达莱花和数不清的彩旗织成了一条彩色的河流，人们的欢呼声直上云霄。
    游行在十时结束。
    据新华社平壤14日电　平壤市各界八百多人今天晚上在牡丹峰剧场集会庆祝八·一五朝鲜解放十三周年。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成参加了大会，参加大会的还有朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健，内阁副首相洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、郑准泽，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲、金昌满，以及内阁各相，劳动党中央各部部长，各民主政党、社会团体负责人，朝鲜人民军高级将领等。各国驻朝鲜使节和以丁莱夫少将为首的中国人民志愿军代表团也应邀参加了大会。
    朝鲜内阁副首相金一在大会上作了报告。他首先向朝鲜人民的解放者——苏联共产党、苏联政府和军队表示感谢。接着他叙述了解放后十三年来朝鲜人民所取得的胜利和成就。
    金一说，朝鲜北部的社会主义建设进入了最高潮，骑上了千里马的朝鲜人民以冲天的革命干劲进行的斗争是加强革命民主基地和促进祖国和平统一的最有力的保证。
    金一在谈到中近东局势时表示，朝鲜人民决不能容忍美英帝国主义者对中近东的侵略行为。朝鲜人民将尽最大的力量来支持和声援黎巴嫩和约旦人民的民族解放斗争。美英侵略军队应该立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。如果帝国主义者无视今天的现实和历史教训，继续进行侵略，他们必将遭到更加严重的失败。金一接着说，朝鲜人民继续强硬要求美国侵略者立即撤出南朝鲜，由朝鲜人民自己来解决朝鲜问题。
    金一谴责了集中地表现在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人身上的现代修正主义。他说，今天国际共产主义和工人运动坚决批判修正主义，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下更加团结一致了。
    苏联驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办皮里申科也在大会上讲了话。
