    Victory Belongs to the Arab People
    The Republic of Iraq has now been recognized by forty-four countries. Even the governments of the United States and Britain, which blatantly sent troops to the Middle East to carry out military threats because of the Iraqi revolution, have had to announce their recognition of this republic under the pressure of the world's peaceful forces. The struggle surrounding Iraq is far from over. But in any case, the people of Iraq and the world's forces for peace have won a great victory, and the imperialist aggressors have suffered a tragic defeat, which cannot be doubted.
    The victory of the Iraqi revolution has extremely important and multifaceted significance in modern history and deserves detailed discussion. Now we would like to offer some simple opinions from the perspective of the Arab national independence movement.
    The 20th century is a new era in which the peoples of the East are awakening one after another. They began to participate in international political life as an independent political force. In just a few decades, especially in the ten years or so since World War II, most Asian countries have freed themselves from their colonial status. Among the seventeen Arab countries and regions with a population of more than 80 million, ten Arab countries with a population of more than 70 million have achieved varying degrees of independence; 10 million Algerian people have persisted in a national liberation war for four years, and have expanded the area of armed struggle to the whole country. Among the countries that have achieved legal independence, their independence is still incomplete and unstable. Imperialism is still trying to tightly control them economically, politically, and militarily, or push them back to their former slave status. The main task of struggle facing the people of these countries is to achieve true national independence. Their struggle has now won one victory after another. In the past three years alone, the people of the Arab East have won three great victories against imperialist aggression. These are the victory of the Egyptian people in resisting Anglo-French aggression in 1956, the victory of the Syrian people in resisting American aggression conspiracies in 1957, and the victory of the Iraqi people in overthrowing the Faisal dynasty and opposing American and British military threats in 1958.
    The ability of the Arab people to move from one victory to another is inseparable from the overall situation of the struggle against imperialism. This situation is that since World War II, the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union have become a world system and have already surpassed the imperialist countries in terms of overall power; the increased awareness of the oppressed nations, the support of the socialist countries, and the weakening of colonial forces have made the national independence movement unprecedentedly high. Imperialism is in decline, and the colonial system is collapsing. Neither the old British and French colonialism nor the new American colonialism can reverse this historical trend. The rapid development of the Arab national independence movement is due to the favorable situation it is in, because it is part of the worldwide national independence movement, and because it can obtain the sincere support of the powerful socialist camp, especially the Soviet Union, which is a close neighbor of the Arab countries in the Middle East.
    The Arab nation is a nation with a long history and tradition. From the 16th century onwards, most Arab countries suffered from the long-term rule of the Ottoman Empire. After World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, but the bloody years of Western colonialists such as Britain and France dividing, enslaving, plundering, and invading Arab countries began again. However, at this time, the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, had already appeared on the stage of world history, which greatly promoted and encouraged the national independence movements in Eastern countries and Arab countries. After World War II, the strength of imperialism was greatly weakened, and its colonial rule throughout the East also wavered. The Arab national independence movement has developed even more. When American imperialism, under the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," vainly attempted to fill the "vacuum" of Britain and France and dominate the Middle East, the broad masses of the Arab people had already stood up. From this historical development process, it can be seen that the colonial rule of the British and French imperialists over Arab countries was shorter than that of the Ottoman Empire, and the fate of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was even shorter than that of the old British and French colonialists. This is obviously not because the rule of "modern civilization's" British and French colonialism was weaker than the feudal rule of the Ottoman Empire, nor because American neo-colonialism, the most ferocious enemy of the national independence movement, was weaker than the already declining old British and French colonialism, but because the forces that destroy imperialism and its colonial system - the socialist movement and the national independence movement - have developed into an unprecedentedly powerful force in history. This shows that the struggle of the Arab people is not isolated, and their victory is not accidental.
    The long-term struggle against imperialism, especially the three struggles against imperialist aggression in the past three years, has made the Arab people deeply aware that independence and freedom cannot be obtained by begging for and compromising with imperialism, and that there should be no illusions about imperialism, especially American imperialism. For example, the Arab national independence movement forced imperialism to make some concessions very early on. Britain was forced to recognize the independence of Iraq and Egypt in 1921-1922 respectively, and then recognized the independence of Jordan in 1946; France also announced the abolition of its mandate over Syria and Lebanon in 1941; however, these concessions by imperialism were hypocritical, and under the name of "independence," they continued to rule Arab countries by concluding various unequal treaties, "legally" stationing troops, creating coups, and supporting puppets. American imperialism gradually infiltrated the Middle East after World War II, until it raised the black flag of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and tried its best to exclude British and French forces, and ferociously suppressed the national independence movement, vainly attempting to dominate the Middle East. Can the people of Arab countries be satisfied with nominal independence, tolerate disguised rule and enslavement, or endure the more ferocious rule of American neo-colonialism? Of course not. But when the Arab countries rose up to strive for and maintain true national independence, they encountered the crazy attacks of British, French and American imperialism. For example, the revolution broke out in Egypt in 1952, overthrowing the Farouk dynasty, establishing a republic, and forcing the last batch of British colonial troops to get out of the Suez Canal area in 1956, and then announcing the recovery of the Suez Canal Company; in this way, Britain and France exerted tremendous pressure and threats on Egypt in order to regain the Suez Canal Company, and then launched a war of aggression against Egypt. The United States initially openly participated in the diplomatic conspiracy to regain the Suez Canal Company, and attempted to take the opportunity to gain control over the canal. Later, it changed its appearance and pretended to disagree with the Anglo-French aggression, but after the war, it threatened Egypt, attempting to control the canal and the Gulf of Aqaba. The Syrian people ended the competition between American and British imperialism in creating frequent coups and seizing Syria in 1955, and established a nationalist regime. The United States then fabricated a subversion conspiracy against Syria. After this conspiracy failed, it planned a conspiracy to invade Syria in 1957. The Jordanian people drove away the British General Glubb, who had ruled Jordan for decades, abolished the Anglo-Jordanian treaty, and formed a nationalist regime in 1956. However, the Jordanian nationalist regime was subverted by the United States in 1957, and under the planning of the United States and Britain, the Jordanian Hussein dynasty formed an "Arab Federation" with the Iraqi Faisal dynasty, which was used to oppose the United Arab Republic. In May of this year, the Lebanese people broke out in an uprising, and then with a thunderclap, the Iraqi people broke out in a revolution, which severely shook the foundation of British and American imperialist rule and aggression in the Middle East. The United States, ignoring the lessons of the failure of the conspiracy to invade Syria, and Britain, ignoring the Suez lesson, hurriedly embarked on the dead end of joint aggression. May I ask, Britain and France launched a war of aggression against Egypt the year before last, the United States planned a war of aggression against Syria last year, and the United States and Britain jointly invaded this year. Can the Arab people have independence and freedom without a firm struggle against such crazy aggressors who are unwilling to fail?
    Experience has proved that as long as the Arab people firmly stand up and fight against imperialism, they can rely on close unity with the socialist camp, on the broad unity of patriotic and democratic forces in their own countries, and on equal cooperation between Arab countries to defeat any powerful imperialist aggression. Among these conditions, particularly important is close unity with the socialist camp, not only because the strength of the socialist camp is greater than the strength of the imperialist camp, but also because the socialist camp's support for the people of all countries to resist aggression and defend peace is sincere and selfless. The anti-imperialist national struggle is inseparable from the anti-feudal democratic struggle. Only by relying on the unity of the democratic forces of their own people can they effectively strive for independence and build the country. Unity among Arab countries is also an important factor for them to resist aggression and strive for and maintain independence. Imperialism fears that the Arab people understand and grasp these truths, and tries its best to slander the foreign policies of socialist countries, and buys and supports a small group of reactionary puppets and traitors to deal with the patriotic and democratic forces of various countries, and divides the unity among Arab countries, in order to achieve the purpose of aggression and subversion of nationally independent countries. However, all these conspiracies can only succeed at most in a certain period, in a very small number of countries and among some people, and will eventually go bankrupt. The victory of the Iraqi revolution is the best proof. For many years, British and American imperialism have used Iraq as a war base against socialist countries, as a tool to divide the unity of Arab countries, and maintained imperialist rule over Iraq through the bloody suppression of domestic patriotic and democratic forces by the Faisal dynasty and the Said government. However, imperialism and its agents cannot but become increasingly detached from the people, increasingly intensify their contradictions with the Iraqi people and national interests, and increasingly make them dangerously sit on the crater of a volcano. Now they cannot but collapse one morning. The revolutionary Iraq has changed from a reactionary autocratic kingdom to a republic, from a tool for dividing the unity of Arab countries to a factor for strengthening this unity, and from an imperialist base against the socialist camp to a forward position against imperialist aggression supported by the socialist camp. Now, the Republic of Iraq has been recognized by forty-four countries and has received the support of peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world. This newborn republic has gained a firm foothold; the plan of British and American imperialism to strangle the Republic of Iraq has shamefully failed.
    British and American imperialism are still baring their fangs and claws, preparing to expand their aggression, in order to extinguish the raging flames of the Arab people striving for independence and freedom, but this is definitely no longer possible. Under extremely unfavorable circumstances, they want to play political conspiracies and transform themselves into "friends" of the Arab people, which has become even more difficult. The true face of American imperialism as the deadly enemy of the independence movement of the Arabs and all oppressed nations has been thoroughly exposed, which has greatly educated and united the people. No matter what kind of hard or soft deals the United States makes, it cannot stop the Arab nation from achieving true independence. The people of all countries in the world who have embarked on the road of independence and are still under colonial rule will surely win the victory against imperialist aggression and enslavement.

    胜利属于阿拉伯人民
    伊拉克共和国现在已经获得四十四个国家的承认，甚至因为伊拉克革命而公然出兵中东进行武力威胁的美英两国政府，在全世界和平力量的压迫下，也不得不宣布承认这个共和国了。围绕着伊拉克的斗争还远没有结束。但是无论如何，伊拉克人民和世界和平力量已经取得了一次伟大的胜利，而帝国主义侵略势力已经遭到了一次悲惨的失败，这是不能怀疑的了。
    伊拉克革命的胜利在现代历史上具有极其重大的多方面的意义，值得详细的讨论。现在我们想先从阿拉伯民族独立运动的观点说一些简单的意见。
    二十世纪是东方各族人民纷纷觉醒的新时代。他们开始作为独立的政治力量，参加国际政治生活。只经过短短的几十年，特别是第二次世界大战以后的十多年，亚洲大多数国家已摆脱了殖民地地位。在八千多万人口的十七个阿拉伯国家和地区中，也已有七千多万人口的十个阿拉伯国家取得了不同程度的独立；一千万阿尔及利亚人民坚持了四年民族解放战争，已把武装斗争地区扩大到了全国。在法律地位上已取得独立的国家中，它们的独立还是不完全和不巩固的，帝国主义还力图在经济、政治、军事上紧紧地控制它们，或者把它们推回到以前的奴隶地位。这些国家的人民面前的主要斗争任务，就是取得真正的民族独立。他们的这个斗争，现已得到了一个接连一个的胜利。仅仅在最近三年，阿拉伯东方的人民就取得了三次反对帝国主义侵略的巨大胜利，这就是1956年的埃及人民反抗英法侵略的胜利，1957年的叙利亚人民反抗美国侵略阴谋的胜利，1958年的伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔王朝、反对美英武力威胁的胜利。
    阿拉伯人民能够从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，是同整个反对帝国主义的斗争形势分不开的。这个形势就是，第二次世界大战以后，以苏联为首的社会主义国家已成为一个世界体系，并且已经在总的力量对比方面胜过帝国主义国家；被压迫民族人民觉悟的提高，社会主义国家的支援，殖民主义势力的削弱，就使得民族独立运动空前高涨起来。帝国主义在衰落中，殖民制度在崩溃中，不管是英法旧殖民主义或美国新殖民主义势力，都不能扭转这一历史趋势。阿拉伯民族独立运动的迅速发展，就是由于它是处于这样有利的形势，由于它是全世界民族独立运动的一部分，由于它可以得到强大的社会主义阵营首先是中东阿拉伯各国的近邻苏联的真诚支持。
    阿拉伯民族是一个有悠久历史传统的民族。从十六世纪起，大部分阿拉伯国家遭受了奥斯曼帝国的长期统治。第一次世界大战后，奥斯曼帝国瓦解了，却又开始了英、法等西方殖民主义者分割、奴役、掠夺和侵略阿拉伯各国的血腥岁月。但是，在这个时候，第一个社会主义国家苏联已经出现在世界历史舞台上，从而大大地推动和鼓舞了东方各国和阿拉伯各国的民族独立运动。第二次世界大战后，帝国主义的力量被大大削弱了，它们在整个东方的殖民统治也发生了动摇。阿拉伯民族独立运动有了更大的发展。轮到美帝国主义打着“艾森豪威尔主义”旗帜，妄图填补英法“真空”，独霸中近东的时候，广大的阿拉伯人民已经站起来了。从这个历史发展的过程可以看出，英法帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的殖民统治所以要比奥斯曼帝国的统治短命，“艾森豪威尔主义”的命运所以又比英法旧殖民主义者更短命。这显然不是因为“现代文明”的英法殖民主义的统治比奥斯曼帝国的封建统治弱一些，也不是因为美国新殖民主义这个民族独立运动最凶恶的敌人比已经衰落的英法旧殖民主义弱一些，而是因为摧毁帝国主义及其殖民制度的力量——社会主义运动和民族独立运动，已经发展为历史上从来没有过的强大力量。这说明阿拉伯人民的斗争不是孤立的，他们的胜利不是偶然的。
    反对帝国主义的长期斗争，特别是最近三年来反对帝国主义三次侵略的斗争，使阿拉伯人民深切地认识到，独立自由不能靠向帝国主义乞求和妥协取得，对帝国主义尤其是对美帝国主义不能有任何的幻想。例如，阿拉伯民族独立运动很早就迫使帝国主义作了一些让步。英国在1921—1922年就被迫分别承认了伊拉克和埃及的独立，1946年又承认了约旦的独立；法国也在1941年就宣布取消了对叙利亚和黎巴嫩的委任统治；但是，帝国主义的这些让步是虚伪的，它们在“独立”的名义下，以订立各种不平等条约、“合法”地驻军、制造政变、扶植傀儡等等方式，继续统治着阿拉伯国家。美帝国主义在第二次世界大战后逐步渗入中东，直到打出“艾森豪威尔主义”的黑旗，既竭力排斥英法势力，又凶恶地镇压民族独立运动，妄图独霸中东。阿拉伯国家人民能满足于形式上的独立，能容忍改头换面的统治和奴役，能忍受美国新殖民主义更凶恶的统治吗？当然不能。但是当阿拉伯国家起来争取和维护真正的民族独立的时候，它们就遇到了美英法帝国主义的疯狂的进攻。例如1952年埃及爆发革命，推翻了法鲁克王朝，建立了共和国，并在1956年迫使最后一批英国殖民军滚出了苏伊士运河区，接着宣布收回苏伊士运河公司；这样，英法就为了夺回苏伊士运河公司而向埃及施加了巨大压力和威胁，接着发动了侵埃战争。美国最初是公开参加夺回苏伊士运河公司的外交阴谋，并企图乘机取得对运河的控制权，后来它摇身一变装作不同意英法的侵略，可是在战事结束后又威胁埃及，企图控制运河和亚喀巴湾。叙利亚人民在1955年结束了美英帝国主义制造频繁政变、争夺叙利亚的角逐，建立了民族主义政权。美国就制造对叙利亚的颠覆阴谋，这个阴谋失败后，在1957年又策划了侵略叙利亚的阴谋。约旦人民则在1956年赶走了统治约旦数十年的英国将军格拉布，废除了英约条约，组成了民族主义政权。但约旦民族主义政权在1957年被美国所颠覆，并在美英策划下，约旦侯赛因王朝同伊拉克费萨尔王朝结成了“阿拉伯联邦”，用来敌对阿拉伯联合共和国。今年5月，黎巴嫩人民爆发了起义，接着霹雳一声，伊拉克人民爆发了革命，剧烈地震撼了美英帝国主义统治和侵略中东的基础。美国竟顾不得侵叙阴谋失败的教训，英国顾不得苏伊士教训，仓皇地走上了联合侵略的绝路。试问，前年是英法发动侵埃战争，去年是美国策划侵叙战争，今年是美英一起联合侵略，对于如此不甘心失败的疯狂的侵略者，不经过坚决的斗争，阿拉伯人民能有独立自由可言吗？
    经验证明，阿拉伯人民只要坚决站起来同帝国主义作斗争，他们就可以依靠同社会主义阵营的紧密联合，依靠本国爱国民主力量的广泛团结，依靠阿拉伯国家之间的平等合作，击败任何强大的帝国主义侵略。在这些条件中，特别重要的是同社会主义阵营的紧密联合，这不仅因为社会主义阵营的力量大于帝国主义阵营的力量，而且因为社会主义阵营支援各国人民反抗侵略、保卫和平是真诚和无私的。反帝国主义的民族斗争同反封建主义的民主斗争是分不开的，只有依靠本国人民的民主力量的团结，才能有效地争取独立和建设国家。阿拉伯国家之间的团结也是它们抵抗侵略、争取和维护独立的重要因素。帝国主义害怕阿拉伯人民懂得和掌握这些真理，竭力诬蔑社会主义国家的外交政策，收买和扶植一小撮反动的傀儡和奸细来对付各国的爱国民主力量，分裂阿拉伯国家间的团结，以便达到侵略和颠覆民族独立国家的目的。然而，这一切阴谋手法至多只能在一定的时期、极少数国家和一些人中得逞，而终于还是要破产的。伊拉克革命的胜利，就是最好的证明。多少年来美英帝国主义把伊拉克作为反对社会主义国家的战争基地，作为分裂阿拉伯国家团结的工具，并通过费萨尔王朝和赛义德政府对国内爱国民主力量的血腥镇压来维持帝国主义对伊拉克的统治。可是，帝国主义及其代理人却不能不日益脱离人民，日益加剧他们同伊拉克人民和民族利益的矛盾，日益使他们危险地坐在火山口上，现在他们不能不在一个早晨就垮了台。革命后的伊拉克已由反动的专制王国变为共和国，由分裂阿拉伯国家团结的工具变为加强这个团结的因素，由帝国主义的反对社会主义阵营的基地变为在社会主义阵营支持下反对帝国主义侵略的前哨阵地。现在，伊拉克共和国已经得到了四十四个国家的承认，得到了全世界爱好和平和自由的人民的支持。这个新生的共和国已经站稳了；美英帝国主义企图扼杀伊拉克共和国的计划可耻地失败了。
    美英帝国主义还在张牙舞爪，准备扩大侵略，来扑灭阿拉伯人民争取独立自由的熊熊火焰，但这肯定已经是不行了。它们在极端不利的形势下，想耍政治阴谋，摇身一变而为阿拉伯人民的“朋友”，也已经更难办到了。美帝国主义是阿拉伯和所有被压迫民族的独立运动的死敌的真面目已彻底暴露，这大大地教育和团结了人民。美国的任何硬的软的勾当，都不能阻止阿拉伯民族取得真正的独立。全世界已走上独立道路的和还在殖民统治下的各国人民，也都一定能取得反对帝国主义的侵略和奴役的胜利。美式“自由神”　苏联　里索戈尔斯基（原载苏联“劳动报”）
