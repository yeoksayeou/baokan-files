Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 1st: Lebanese pro-Western President Camille Chamoun issued a statement on July 31 saying that he is "determined" to remain in the presidential office until his term expires on September 23.

Chamoun made this statement after meeting with Fouad Chehab, who was elected as the next president yesterday. However, according to a report in the Damascus newspaper "Al-Rai al-Aam" yesterday, Chehab and Chamoun have reached a secret agreement stipulating that Chamoun will leave Lebanon within ten days of Chehab's election. If this is the case, although Chamoun will still be formally president until September 23, Chehab will assume Chamoun's duties after being elected.

    夏蒙表示要干到期满
    新华社1日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩亲西方总统夏蒙在7月31日发表声明说，他“决心”要继续留在总统职位上，直到9月23日任期届满为止。
    夏蒙是在同昨天当选下届总统的谢哈布会谈以后发表这项声明的。但据大马士革“舆论报”昨天报道，谢哈布和夏蒙已经达成秘密协议，规定夏蒙将在谢哈布当选后十天内离开黎巴嫩。如果这样，虽然夏蒙直到9月23日以前还是正式总统，但是谢哈布在当选以后就担负起夏蒙的职务。
