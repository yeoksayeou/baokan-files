Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 25th: Former French Prime Minister Mendes-France, who returned from a visit to China, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today that he and Roland Dumas, a member of the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance, were deeply impressed by the tremendous efforts made by this vast country to develop its economy on an unprecedented scale.

Mendes-France said that they praised China's achievements in industry and agriculture, which guarantee further development in the future. They saw the entire Chinese people participating in this work with inspiring determination, which is the best guarantee for progress.

Mendes-France said, "I was very happy to meet Premier Zhou Enlai again. I have always admired him since I had the honor of meeting him. He explained to me in detail the plan for developing the economy under his leadership and described the results that have been achieved. He expressed his happiness with the great development in agricultural production this year. This is clearly a factor that is conducive to improving the national economy and raising the people's living standards."

Mendes-France then expressed his hope that various contacts and relations between France and China would develop day by day at an accelerating pace. He said: "In addition to some cultural exchanges, contacts and relations in various fields should also be strengthened." He said that two great countries with long histories like ours can and should provide each other with opportunities to deepen and improve mutual understanding. Greater efforts should also be made in trade than have been made so far. He also expressed his hope that the improvement of Sino-French relations would help normalize relations between the two camps in the world today.

Mendes-France finally said that he and Dumas received extremely hospitable and warm hospitality everywhere during their visit to China. He expressed his heartfelt thanks for this.

    孟戴斯—弗朗斯谈访华印象
    新华社巴黎25日电　访问中国归来的法国前总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯今天在接见新华社记者时说，他同民主社会抵抗联盟议员罗兰·杜马对于这个辽阔的国家为了以史无前例的规模发展经济而作出的巨大努力，有深刻的印象。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，他们赞扬中国在工农业方面所取得的成就，这些成就保证了将来进一步的发展。他们看到全中国人民抱着令人振奋的决心参加这种工作，而这是取得进步的最好的保证。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，我重新会见了贵国总理周恩来，我个人感到非常高兴。自从我荣幸地认识他以来，我对他一直非常钦佩。他向我详细阐述了他所主持的发展经济的计划，并且叙述了已经取得的成果。他对于今年农业生产方面的大发展表示高兴。这显然是有利于改善全国经济和提高人民生活水平的因素。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯接着表示希望法国和中国之间的各种接触和关系以加快的步伐一天天发展。他说：除了在文化方面的一些交往之外，还应该加强各方面的接触和关系。他说，像我们两个文化悠久的大国，可以而且也应该相互提供机会，来加深和改善相互的了解。在贸易方面，也应该作出比到目前为止更大的努力。他还表示，希望法中关系的改善会有助于使目前世界上两个阵营之间的关系的正常化。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯最后说，我和杜马在中国访问期间到处都受到极其好客和极其热诚的款待。他对此表示衷心的感谢。
