Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 13th: The "Akahata" newspaper published a special edition on August 10th containing the Action Program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party on August 1st. This Action Program is the basic guideline for the JCP's current actions before the program section in the draft Party Constitution is adopted.

The program states that the JCP will struggle for the goal of world peace and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The JCP will fight to realize the normalization of relations between Japan and all countries, to develop economic and cultural exchanges, and to foster friendly relations between peoples. The JCP opposes the aggressive war preparations and all atomic war preparations of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous reactionary forces in Japan.

The program states that the JCP will, through thorough struggle, overthrow the "San Francisco Treaty" system established by U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces centered on Japanese monopoly capital, which manufactures wars and betrays the nation; abolish all traitorous treaties; recover Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands; expel all U.S. troops; dismantle U.S. military bases; and complete the nation's complete independence.

The program then states that the JCP will unite with the people of the world who are fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism to promote the movement against imperialism and colonialism. The JCP will strengthen proletarian solidarity in the spirit of "Workers of all countries, unite!" At the same time, the JCP firmly supports the socialist camp, communists worldwide, and the struggles of people in all countries for human progress.

The program states that the JCP will defend the democratic rights of the people and oppose all reactionary measures. The JCP will overthrow all repressive laws and institutions imposed on the people by U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces, eliminate Tennoism and militarist ideology, and eradicate feudal remnants.

The program states that the JCP will fight for the life and rights of workers, peasants, fishermen, laborers, unliberated tribal people, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, intellectuals, women, and youth.

The program points out that regarding the life and rights of workers, the rights to organize, strike, and bargain collectively must be maintained; a minimum wage system and a forty-hour work week must be strived for; and labor laws must be defended. Regarding the life and rights of peasants, resolute opposition must be made to the U.S. military and the "Self-Defense Forces" occupying land, and to landlords disposing of tenant farmers' land at will. At the same time, state-owned, publicly owned, or large mountain forest owners' land should be distributed to farmers who have no or little land. Opposition must be made to heavy taxes and monopoly prices, and prices for agricultural products suitable for production costs must be demanded, and land, jobs, and wages must be demanded for agricultural workers and poor peasants.

The program points out that the JCP will fight to improve the living standards of working people, abolish unequal treatment of tribal peoples, improve the lives of intellectuals, women, youth, and students, and oppose the exploitation of small and medium-sized enterprises by monopoly capital.

The program concludes by stating that the JCP resolutely opposes the fiscal and economic policies of U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital. At the same time, it will break free from foreign capital's control over the Japanese economy, and the people will supervise monopoly enterprises. Then, through this supervision, monopoly enterprises such as financial institutions and important industries will gradually be nationalized.
