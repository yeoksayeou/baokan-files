    Eliminating Heavy Labor Underground
    ——The Story of Worker Xu Jingfeng Creating the Coal Loading Machine
    Wang Dewen, Ma Yanling

    Loading coal is the process of using a shovel to move coal, which has been mined by machinery and explosives, onto an electric conveyor. It's a heavy manual labor task on the underground coal mining face, and the only remaining heavy labor task underground. However, this task was solved by Xu Jingfeng, a mechanical and electrical worker above ground. Here's a little story:

    As early as 1953, when the mine began using electric coal conveyors, the underground workers were very happy, but it was too strenuous to load the coal without a machine. At that time, Xu Jingfeng wanted to create a machine to replace manual coal loading. Coincidentally, Xu Jingfeng went to the coal yard to haul back a ton of coal. During the coal collection, he personally experienced the difficulty of loading coal, which strengthened his determination to create a coal loading machine. He immediately began designing the coal loading machine based on the principle he learned while collecting coal: that it was easier to shovel the coal and then push it with his leg. However, this creation was unsuccessful for several years.

    This year, after the nationwide technical revolution began, the spirit of daring to think and daring to do encouraged Xu Jingfeng. During the great leap in production throughout the mine, the workers raised the issue of liberating coal loading workers again. This made Xu Jingfeng feel his great responsibility and that he should quickly create a successful coal loading machine. However, because he did not understand underground production, progress was slow. At this time, the Party organization found Xu Jingfeng and expressed that the Party fully supported him; but also pointed out his shortcomings in not utilizing collective wisdom. This encouragement and criticism from the Party organization gave Xu Jingfeng a clear direction. So he went to the Party committee and asked to tell everyone about his coal loading machine creation and ask for everyone's help. At a meeting attended by leading cadres, technicians, and workers from the Party and administration, Xu Jingfeng introduced his plan and practices in detail. Some technicians at the meeting raised difficulties based on underground conditions, such as "the working face underground is not as flat as the ground" and "the inclination of the coal seam varies." Xu Jingfeng was a little discouraged. At this time, the Party branch secretary said that he would give him strong assistance in his work and technology. This further strengthened Xu Jingfeng's confidence.

    After many improvements, the coal loading machine created by Xu Jingfeng was successfully tested on the ground on April 30. However, during the first underground test, the problem of uneven floor was solved based on the working face conditions; but during the second test, it was still affected by the slope of the coal seam. Also, when loading coal, coal dust ran into the chain, blocking the chain and preventing it from turning. They referred to the structure of the coal loading part of the combine harvester and made improvements. Finally, it was successfully tested in the 9627 section of the Tangshan Mine.

    This coal loading machine is powered by electricity, automatically loads coal, and loads the coal into the electric conveyor. It is light, small, flexible, and suitable for underground operation. (Attached picture)

    消除井下的笨重劳动
    ——工人徐静峰创造坌煤机的故事
    汪德文  马延龄
    坌煤，是把用机械和炸药采下来的煤一锹锹地坌到电溜子上去，是井下采煤工作面的笨重的体力劳动。也是目前井下仅存的一项笨重劳动。可是，这件工作却被井上机电工人徐静峰解决了。这里有个小故事：
    还在1953年，矿上开始使用运煤电溜子，井下工人很高兴，就是坌煤没机器太费劲。那时徐静峰就想搞个机器来代替人力坌煤。可巧徐静峰去煤栈拉回一吨煤，在收煤的时候，亲身体验到坌煤费劲，坚定了他创造坌煤机的决心，并即开始根据他收煤时，用锹铲煤再用腿顶一下省力的道理，开始进行坌煤机的设计了。但是几年来这个创造始终没有成功。
    今年，全国各地技术革命开始后，人们敢想敢干的精神，鼓舞着徐静峰。在全矿生产大跃进中，工人们又提出了解放坌煤工人的问题。这使徐静峰感到自己的责任重大，应当很快的把坌煤机创造成功。但由于他不懂井下生产，进度很慢。这时党组织找到了徐静峰，表示党完全支持他；但也指出他没有发挥集体智慧的缺点。党组织的这一鼓励和批评，使徐静峰有了明确的方向。于是他去找党委，要求把他创造的坌煤机的事告诉给大家，请求大家帮助。在一次党和行政的领导干部、技术人员、工人参加的会议上，徐静峰详细地介绍了他的计划和做法，会上有的技术人员根据井下条件提出：“井下工作面不如地面平坦”“煤层倾斜度大小不同”等困难，徐静峰有些泄气，这时党总支书记表示不论在工作上技术上都将给他大力协助。更加坚定徐静峰的信心。
    经过多次改进，徐静峰创造的坌煤机4月30日在地面试验成功了。但是第一次下井试验，根据工作面情况，解决了底板不平的问题；可是在第二次试验时，还受到煤层斜度的影响和在坌煤时，煤粉往链子里跑，把链子塞住转不动，他们参照了康拜因坌煤部分的构造，进行了改进，终于在唐山矿9627礃试验成功了。
    这个坌煤机用电力发动，自动坌煤，并把煤装在电溜子里，轻便、小巧灵活，适于井下操作。（附图片）
