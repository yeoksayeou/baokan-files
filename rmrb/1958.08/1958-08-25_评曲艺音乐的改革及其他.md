A Review of the Reform of Quyi Music and Other Issues
　　Lü Ji

The Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) performance meeting allowed us to hear various types of Quyi popular in different regions. Although many were familiar, everyone felt that these forms had new developments and changes to varying degrees. Obviously, these new developments and changes occurred because these forms were combined with the new socialist life. Thanks to the brilliance of the General Line illuminating every corner, the actors' thinking has been further enhanced. Even traditional programs have been swept away from old dust and have begun to radiate new brilliance.

Even the slightest reform of each Quyi form due to the expression of new content is not achieved without obstacles. For example, in Shanghai Pingtan (storytelling and ballad singing in Suzhou dialect), in order not to harm the content because of rhymes, some sentences had their final rhymes changed from level tones to oblique tones, breaking the strict seven-character sentence rule, which required fighting against conservative elements among the audience. Despite these conservative elements' disparaging remarks that it was simply not like Pingtan anymore, to the point of anger and leaving their seats, the reform and development of Pingtan was not affected. Progressive Pingtan artists have created vigorous and vibrant works like "Be Sure to Repair the Huai River Well," "Liu Hulan," and the recent "Ideology is Planted with Big Red Flags," which are welcomed by the masses, and further broke through the general performance forms, creating new Pingtan like "The East Wind Absolutely Overwhelms the West Wind," full of pride, confidence, and truly reflecting the people's emotions. It should be said that these works have indeed brought Pingtan into a new era.

Although the reform of Pingtan has achieved gratifying results, there is still much to be done. For example, in music, it is necessary to fully utilize the rich heritage accumulated by Pingtan music over a long period, and continue to absorb new nutrients from other musical forms.

Pingtan music does indeed have a rich heritage. In the nearly 140 to 150 years since Yu Xiushan and Ma Rufei respectively created the "Yu Tune" and "Ma Tune," talents have emerged in large numbers. Many outstanding performers, who are actually also composers, have created many new tunes based on their own musical accomplishments and their experiences in life, such as the "Xia Tune" created by Xia Hesheng, and the currently most popular "Jiang Tune" created by Jiang Yuequan. These Pingtan music pieces have become an important part of folk music in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. This huge musical treasure should not only be valued by the Pingtan community but also by the music community. If we can record the essence of these "tunes" and make records, it can not only help us specifically understand the trends in the development of Pingtan music in the past few hundred years, but also provide rich composing and performing experience, which will be of great help for further developing Pingtan music. Such work is necessary and beneficial for the Quyi of each region, and for each type of Quyi form.

To make Pingtan fully adapt to the requirements of the new socialist life, relying solely on excavating the traditional music of Pingtan cannot completely solve the problem. Because traditional music is only a product of the old era and old life, and the people's lives it reflects are limited, it is necessary to continue to absorb new nutrients suitable for oneself from folk songs, opera music, fraternal Quyi forms, and even new music creations, to create some new tunes. Just as each Pingtan "tune" initially absorbed some other music to form its own unique "tune."

It should be said that such absorption of nutrients from folk songs, operas, fraternal Quyi forms, and new musical creations is different from the practice of arbitrarily absorbing other music in "Ten Brocades Opening Chapter" (Shi Jin Kai Pian). That is just a musical hodgepodge, no wonder it is opposed by the Quyi community and all parties. If, according to the needs of the content, new nutrients are absorbed from other music, and after digestion, new tunes are created, like many outstanding Pingtan predecessors in the past, then it can truly make Pingtan music richer and develop to a higher stage. This principle is equally suitable for other Quyi forms.

To promote the development of Pingtan music, it certainly mainly depends on the performers and composers of Pingtan music, but new music workers cannot shirk their responsibility. Because Pingtan, like many other Quyi forms, is indeed a musical genre.

During the Quyi performance meeting, in the reports made by Comrades Zhou Yang and Liu Zhiming, they both called on music workers to learn from Quyi and participate in the reform work of Quyi music. This call is very timely and completely correct. This is not only due to work needs, but also in view of the fact that many music workers have never attached importance to this aspect of work, and even classified Quyi outside the field of music. Obviously, this is a wrong view of measuring our country's music with Western musical scales. At present, when we oppose valuing foreign things over Chinese things, oppose dogmatic views in music teaching, and particularly emphasize the need to develop our country's traditional people's music, I think that our music workers will warmly respond to the call of the Party and the government, and there will be a large number of music workers with lofty ideals who are willing to engage in Quyi music work for life. During the performance meeting, musicians from various musical organizations in Beijing have already begun to enthusiastically learn from Quyi performers from various regions, which is a good start. In fact, some music workers in various regions have already participated in Quyi work. This is a good phenomenon. They will definitely make great achievements.

In order to vigorously promote the development of Quyi, I hope that the Ministry of Culture and local cultural departments will allocate a group of capable music workers to work in Quyi groups as much as possible. In order to inherit and develop the Quyi music heritage, it is hoped that the Central Conservatory of Music and music colleges in various regions will launch research work on Quyi, and systematically establish Quyi majors in the vocal music departments, train new Quyi actors according to a certain proportion, and the composition teaching and research offices of the composition departments should also establish Quyi music research groups, and Quyi music should be given a certain position in the composition course. In short, it is hoped that music colleges, in accordance with the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical," will make great contributions in inheriting and developing the national music tradition and in inheriting and developing the art of Quyi music, under the guidance of the policy.

### 评曲艺音乐的改革及其他

　　评曲艺音乐的改革及其他
　　吕骥
    曲艺会演使我们听到各个地区流行的各种曲艺，虽然有不少是大家所熟悉的，但大家觉得这些形式在不同的程度上有了新的发展和变化。显然，这种新的发展和变化是由于这些形式和社会主义新生活相结合而发生的。由于总路线的光辉照到了每一个角落，演员们的思想有了进一步的提高，即使传统节目也被拂去了旧的尘土，开始放射出新的光彩。
    每一种曲艺形式由于表现新内容而进行的哪怕是极微小的改革，也不是毫无阻碍就能获得的。例如上海评弹为了不要因为韵脚而损害内容，把某些句子的尾韵从平声改成仄声，突破严格的七字句规律，就要和听众中的保守主义分子进行斗争；尽管这些保守主义分子不惜诋毁说，这简直不像评弹了，以至于生气，离座而去，评弹的改革和发展却没有因此而受到影响。进步的评弹艺术家创作了“一定要把淮河修好”“刘胡兰”和最近的“思想插上大红旗”这样泼辣有生命、而且受到广大群众欢迎的作品，进而突破了一般的演唱形式，创造了像“东风绝对压西风”这样的充满着自豪、自信、真实地反映了人民情绪的新评弹。应该说，这些作品的确使评弹跨入了一个新的时代。
    评弹的改革虽然已经取得了可喜的成就，但要做的事情还很多，比如音乐上还需要充分运用评弹音乐长期积累的丰富的遗产，继续从其他音乐形式吸取新的养分。
    评弹音乐的确有丰富的遗产，近一百四、五十年来，自俞秀山、马如飞分别创立了“俞调”、“马调”之后，人才辈出，许多卓越的表演家，其实也是作曲家，在“俞调”和“马调”的基础上，根据自己的音乐修养和对于生活的体验，创造了不少新的腔调，如夏荷生所创造的“夏调”，以及目前最风行的、由蒋月泉所创造的“蒋调”等。这些评弹音乐已经成为江浙地区民间音乐的重要部分。这笔巨大的音乐财富不仅应当受到评弹界的重视，同样也应该受到音乐界的重视。假如我们能够把这些“调”的精华记录下来，并且制成唱片，不仅能够帮助我们具体了解近几百年来评弹音乐发展的倾向，也一定能够提供丰富的作曲经验和演唱经验，对于进一步发展评弹音乐也会有很大的作用。这样的工作，对于每个地方的曲艺、对于每一种曲艺形式都是必要的，有益的。
    要使评弹完全适应社会主义新生活的要求，仅仅依靠发掘评弹的传统音乐是不能全部解决的。因为传统音乐只是旧时代旧生活的产物，而且它所反映的人民生活是有限的，所以必须继续从民歌、戏曲音乐、兄弟曲艺，以至新的音乐创作吸取适合于自己的新的养分，创造一些新的腔调。正如同每一种评弹的“调”当初吸取了一些别的音乐形成自己独特的“调”那样。
    应该说，这样的吸取民歌、戏曲、兄弟曲艺、新的音乐创作中的营养，和“十锦开篇”任意吸取别的音乐的做法是有区别的。这只是一种音乐上的拼盘，无怪要遭到曲艺界和各方面的反对。如果根据内容的需要，向其他音乐吸取新的养分，并且是经过消化，创造新腔，像过去许多卓越的评弹先辈那样，那就能真正使评弹音乐更加丰富，向更高的阶段发展。这个原则对于其他曲艺形式同样是适合的。
    要促进评弹音乐向前发展，固然主要依靠评弹音乐的表演家和作曲家，但新音乐工作者不能因此推卸自己的责任。因为评弹像许多其他曲艺形式一样，的的确确是一种音乐体裁。
    在曲艺会演期间，周扬同志和刘芝明同志所作的报告中，都曾经号召音乐工作者向曲艺学习，并参加曲艺音乐的改革工作。这个号召是非常及时的，是完全正确的。这不仅由于工作需要，而且也是有鉴于许多音乐工作者从来没有重视这方面的工作，甚至于把曲艺划在音乐领域以外。显然，这是用西洋音乐尺度来衡量我国音乐的一种错误观点。目前，当我们反对了重外轻中，反对了音乐教学上的教条主义观点，特别强调要发展我国传统的人民音乐的时候，我想，我们音乐工作者一定会热烈响应党和政府的号召，一定会有大批音乐工作者怀着远大的理想，愿意终身从事曲艺音乐工作。会演期间，北京市各音乐团体的音乐家们已经开始热情地向各地曲艺表演家学习，这是一个很好的开头。事实上，各地已经有一些音乐工作者参加了曲艺工作。这是好现象。他们一定能做出很大的成就。
    为了大力推进曲艺的发展，我希望文化部和各地文化部门尽可能抽调一批有能力的音乐工作者到曲艺团体中去工作。为了继承和发展曲艺音乐遗产，希望中央音乐学院和各地音乐院校展开对于曲艺的研究工作，并且在声乐系内有计划地设立曲艺专业，按照一定的比例培养新的曲艺演员，作曲系的作曲教研室也应该成立曲艺音乐研究小组，在作曲课中应该给曲艺音乐以一定的地位。总之，希望各音乐院校根据多快好省的精神，在继承与发扬民族音乐传统的方针指导下，在继承与发展曲艺音乐艺术方面，作出巨大的贡献！
