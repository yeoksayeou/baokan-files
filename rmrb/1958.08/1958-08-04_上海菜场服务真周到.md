Market Scene is Renewed Daily

    More than 30,000 vegetable market vendors organized in Shanghai are actively improving their service attitude, making the city's 200-plus vegetable markets look brand new.

    In the past, many mothers had to leave their children at home unattended when they went to buy vegetables every day; or bringing their children was tiring. Now, the vast majority of vegetable markets in the city have established customer daycare stations, where someone takes care of the children while the mothers shop. The daycare aunties often wash the children's faces, cut their nails, and comb their hair. If customers don't have time to buy vegetables, the vegetable market vendors can prepare several dishes daily according to a certain amount and the customers' tastes, and deliver them to the customers' homes after cutting and washing them. In the past, some customers who wanted to buy a small amount of fish or meat for patients or children were often embarrassed to ask. Now, many vegetable markets have low-price supply departments. Whether customers want to buy ten cents' worth of ham, five cents' worth of pig liver, a quarter of a salted egg, or one cent's worth of tofu, the vendors treat them warmly. Some vegetable markets have also established liaison stations. If customers want to buy some kind of tonic that is currently in short supply on the market for patients, the liaison stations always try their best to meet this special need. Xiangshan Road Vegetable Market has also established more than 20 stations and offices to serve customers, such as a purchasing service for pregnant women and the elderly, a knife sharpening station, and a small denomination bill exchange station.

    At present, the vegetable markets have not only basically eliminated speculative behaviors such as raising prices, short weighing, adulteration, and passing off inferior goods as good goods, but also actively mobilize the masses to implement supervision and actively protect the health of customers. Many vegetable markets have set up weighing stations and egg product inspection stations.

    Many vegetable markets have also seen the miracle of "no flies on the stalls, no vegetable peels, fish scales, or sputum on the ground."

### 上海菜场服务真周到

    上海菜场服务真周到
    上海市已经组织起来的三万多个菜场摊贩，积极改善服务态度，使全市二百多个菜场面貌焕然一新。
    过去，许多妈妈们每天买菜时，孩子放在家里没人照管；抱上孩子又累；现在，全市绝大多数菜场都建立了顾客托儿站，妈妈们买菜时，就有人代为照管孩子。托儿站的阿姨们还经常给孩子洗脸，剪指甲，梳辫子。如果顾客们没空去买菜，菜场摊贩们就可以按照一定金额和顾客的口味，每天配几盘小菜，切好、洗净后送到顾客家里。过去，有些顾客想给病人、小孩买少量鱼肉吃，常常不好意思开口。现在，不少菜场都设有低价供应部，顾客要买一角钱火腿，五分钱猪肝，四分之一个咸蛋，一分钱豆腐等等，摊贩们都热情地接待。有的菜场还建立了联系站，顾客们如果要给病人买某种市面上正缺少的滋补品，联系站总是千方百计地满足这种特殊需要。象山路菜场还建立了代理孕妇老弱购物处、代客磨刀站、小额钞票兑换站等二十多个为顾客服务的站、处。
    目前，各菜场不仅基本上消除了抬价、缺秤、掺水掺杂、以次货充好货等投机取巧行为，而且主动发动群众实行监督，积极保障顾客的身体健康。许多菜场设立了核秤站、蛋品检验站等。
    许多菜场还出现了“摊上没苍蝇，地上没菜皮、没鱼鳞、没痰迹”的奇迹。
