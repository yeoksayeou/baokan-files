　　Half-Month Agricultural Situation
　　"Great Heat" (July 23rd) - "Beginning of Autumn" (August 8th)
    Before the "Beginning of Autumn," cotton in most areas has entered the peak boll-forming stage. In Dunhuang County, a famous cotton-producing area in Gansu, the cotton plants had about 30 buds each and an average of 10 bolls already formed by the end of July.

    While criticizing the "Beginning of Autumn as the Deciding Factor" theory for cotton, many cotton-producing areas have strengthened late-stage management. Many cotton-producing areas in Jiangsu have promoted the experience of cadres at all levels in Siyang County setting up sheds in the fields and directing production from within them. Preventing and controlling late-stage insect pests in cotton fields is also an important task for cotton-producing areas at present. Judging from the situation during this period, the arrival of the peak boll-forming stage for cotton this year is slightly earlier, but not significantly so. The boll opening period in some areas is about a month earlier than last year.

    Most areas in the south completed late rice transplanting before the "Beginning of Autumn" and began field management after transplanting. Guangdong organized a province-wide large-scale inspection. Various places in Sichuan Province are treating the prevention and control of rice borers as a key to striving for a bumper harvest, preparing to eliminate the three-brooded rice borers during their peak hatching period. Cadres going deep into the fields has played a significant role in promoting the strengthening of management. After cadres at five levels went deep into the fields in Jinjiang Prefecture, Fujian, a red flag emulation campaign for field management was launched in every township and commune.

    In early August, early and mid-season rice entered the late growth stage, and a few areas have already matured. Areas planting late mid-season rice are concentrating their efforts on applying tillering fertilizer or panicle fertilizer during this half-month.

    Agricultural cooperatives and vegetable cooperatives in northern regions are seizing the opportunity during this half-month from "Great Heat" to "Beginning of Autumn" to sow autumn vegetables. Most areas have planted most of their autumn vegetables in the fields before the "Beginning of Autumn." Many areas have adopted the method of increasing multiple cropping this year to expand the planting area of autumn vegetables. Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning are relatively commonly planting autumn vegetables in the fields after harvesting spring wheat. Some areas have also adopted intercropping methods to expand the planting of autumn vegetables. This year, the enthusiasm for sowing autumn vegetables in various northern regions is very high, but there is a general lack of Chinese cabbage seeds.

    Most of the corn and sorghum in northern coarse grain areas are about to tassel or have already tasseled, and early-sown corn, sorghum, millet, etc., are nearing maturity and can be harvested around the "End of Heat." Strengthening late-stage management of autumn coarse grain crops is still one of the important agricultural activities in this area. The habit of "hanging up the hoes" after the "Beginning of Autumn" in many northern regions has been universally negated this year. Some areas in the north that have one harvest a year have increased the planting of buckwheat and other early-maturing coarse grains after harvesting spring wheat this year, striving for two harvests a year.

　　半月农情
　　“大暑”（7月23日）——“立秋”（8月8日）
    到“立秋”以前，大部地区的棉花已进入结铃盛期。甘肃著名棉花产区敦煌县的棉花，到7月底，每株现蕾三十个左右，平均已结铃十个。
    许多棉区在批判棉花“立秋定局论”的同时，加强了后期管理。江苏不少棉区推广了泗阳县各级干部田头搭篷，住篷指挥生产的经验。防治棉田后期虫害，也是棉区当前重要任务。从这个阶段的情况看，今年棉花结铃盛期的到来略有提早，但不显著。个别地区放絮期比去年早一个月左右。
    南方大部地区在“立秋”前已结束晚稻插秧，开始插秧后的田间管理。广东组织了全省规模的大检查。四川省各地把防治螟虫作为争取丰收的一关，准备把三化螟消灭在盛孵期。干部深入田间，对加强管理起到显著的促进作用。福建晋江专区在五级干部深入田间以后，乡乡社社都掀起了田间管理插红旗运动。
    8月初早中稻已进入生长后期，少数地区已经成熟。种植晚中稻地区，在这半个月里正集中力量追施胎肥或穗肥。
    北方地区的农业社、蔬菜社抓紧在“大暑”到“立秋”这半个月里播种秋菜。多数地区在“立秋”前把大部秋菜种到田里。不少地区今年都采取了增加复种的办法扩大秋菜播种面积。黑龙江、吉林、辽宁比较普遍地在收获春麦以后的地里种上秋菜。有些地区还采用了套种办法扩种秋菜。今年北方各地区播种秋菜劲头很大，但普遍缺乏白菜种子。
    北方杂粮地区的大部玉米、高粱将要抽穗或已经抽穗，早播的玉米、高粱、谷子等接近成熟，“处暑”前后就可收获。加强秋季杂粮作物的后期管理，仍是这一地区的重要农事活动之一。北方不少地区的“立秋”挂锄的习惯，今年被普遍否定了。北方一些一年一熟地区今年在收春麦以后增种了一茬荞麦等早熟杂粮，争取一年双收。（附图片）
