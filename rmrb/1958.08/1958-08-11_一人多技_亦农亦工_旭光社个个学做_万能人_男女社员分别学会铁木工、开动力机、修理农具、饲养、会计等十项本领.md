　　One Person, Multiple Skills: Both Farmer and Worker
　　Xuguang Cooperative Members All Learn to Be "Jacks-of-all-Trades"
　　Male and Female Members Learn Ten Skills Respectively, Including Ironworking, Carpentry, Operating Power Machines, Repairing Farm Tools, Animal Husbandry, and Accounting
　　(Our Dispatch) The Xuguang First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dushan Township, Echeng County, Hubei Province, has launched a "Jack-of-all-Trades" movement. In just a few months, it has cultivated 110 "Jacks-of-all-Trades" who are proficient in all agricultural techniques and several industrial skills. This has solved the difficulties of labor shortages and technical deficiencies in the cooperative's simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and has sparked a mass upsurge in technological and cultural revolution.
　　Xuguang First Cooperative began to set up industries in March of this year. The biggest difficulties at that time were the shortage of labor and the lack of technology. Many farm tools and instruments were broken and no one knew how to repair them; people at the processing plant didn't know how to operate power machines; carpenters made safe sprayers, but didn't know how to install the screws; ... If calculated according to specialized personnel, the granular fertilizer plant, the farm tool manufacturing and repair plant, the joint agricultural product processing plant, and the biogas power station would require a total of 209 people. However, the cooperative only had 676 full and semi-able-bodied laborers, who also had to engage in agricultural production. Where could they find so many skilled workers to run the factories? At that time, some people suggested asking the county farm tool factory to send some technicians, while others suggested recalling the cooperative members who were working as laborers outside. After studying the matter, the Party branch felt that neither of these were good solutions, and that they should overcome the difficulties and rely on their own efforts. At the time, they considered: "Xiao Gongzi (branch committee member and deputy director of the cooperative) mastered various technologies such as ironworking, carpentry, fitter work, and drafting design in a very short period of time, and was praised by the masses as a 'Jack-of-all-Trades'. If everyone could learn to be like Xiao Gongzi, wouldn't the problem be solved?" Therefore, the Party branch proposed learning from Xiao Gongzi and launching a "Jack-of-all-Trades" movement. What would qualify as a "Jack-of-all-Trades"? After discussion, the masses formulated the standards for a "Jack-of-all-Trades": male cooperative members should learn all agricultural production techniques, as well as ten skills including carpentry, ironworking, stonemasonry, bricklaying, operating power machines, repairing, designing, animal husbandry, and navigation; female cooperative members should learn all agricultural production techniques, frugality in managing household affairs, needlework, operating power machines, using oxen, repairing, designing, animal husbandry, accounting, and acting. In order to encourage everyone to learn multiple skills, the cooperative decided to award the honorary title of "Jack-of-all-Trades" to those who learned five skills, and issue certificates.
　　When the "Jack-of-all-Trades" standard was first proposed, it aroused opposition from some cooperative members. Old cooperative member Lin Shide said, "I've been a farmer all my life, and now I have to learn a craft. Everyone will become neither fish nor fowl." Rich middle peasant Xie Shengmi said, "Able to do this, able to do that, master of none. Everything is difficult to learn, and nothing will be accomplished." In their view, cooperative members were born to be farmers, and other technologies were unattainable. The Party branch promptly put forward the slogan "Learn everything, delve into every line, master everything, understand everything," and called on "everyone to learn technology and become an expert in every field." Branch secretary Hu Changbi and deputy secretary Hu Fengying took the lead in learning, seizing the gaps before and after meetings, taking advantage of rainy days and evenings, and going to the factories to learn to saw wood and blacksmith. Other branch committee members also actively took the lead. Soon, seven of the nine branch committee members became "Jacks-of-all-Trades." Under the leadership and influence of the secretary, many cooperative members formulated learning plans and took time out of their rest periods to go to the factories to learn technology. The entire cooperative quickly set off a mass upsurge in learning technology.
　　In order to help everyone learn technology well, the Party branch called on cooperative members with higher technical levels to take on apprentices; to help everyone make contracts, learn from each other, and improve together. The Party branch also called on every cooperative member to establish a style of daring to speak, daring to think, and daring to act, and to have a spirit of humble learning. In this way, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for learning technology became even greater. At the same time, the cooperative also established cultural and technical night schools and agricultural experiment universities according to the urgent requirements of cooperative members to learn technology and culture. Everyone learns technology, everyone strives to be a Jack-of-all-Trades, and this has become the prevailing atmosphere in Xuguang First Cooperative.
　　When one person can do multiple jobs, things become easier and manpower is saved. The various factories and stations set up by the cooperative only used 67 people, saving more than 100 people compared to the original plan. In the past, broken farm tools had to be taken to Fankou Town for repair, which cost money and wasted time. Now, many people can repair them themselves.
　　In just two or three months, the cooperative manufactured and repaired more than 800 farm tools and manufactured more than 170,000 jin of granular fertilizer. Party branch member Xiao Gongyou, a twenty-something cashier, always had account books and forms in his canvas bag, as well as marbles, leather lines, screws, glue, rubber and other materials, as well as repair tools such as pliers, wrenches, and screwdrivers, whenever he went to the production teams or fields to check, clear accounts, or issue money to the cooperative members. If anyone's rubber-wheeled cart was broken, he would repair it on the spot. When cooperative members came to him to withdraw money or clear work point accounts, they called him "cashier" or "accountant," and when they asked him to repair their carts, they affectionately called him "rubber-wheeled cart expert."
　　At present, the "Jack-of-all-Trades" movement is flourishing in Dushan Township, where Xuguang First Cooperative is located, and is being promoted throughout Echeng County.

　　一人多技　亦农亦工
　　旭光社个个学做“万能人”
　　男女社员分别学会铁木工、开动力机、修理农具、饲养、会计等十项本领
    本报讯　湖北省鄂城县杜山乡旭光第一农业生产合作社开展“万能人”运动，几个月来已培养了一百一十个既会农业全套技术，又会工业几项技术的“万能人”，解决了农业社在工农业同时并举中劳动力不足和技术缺乏的困难，掀起了群众性的技术革命和文化革命高潮。
    旭光一社从今年3月开始兴办工业，当时的最大困难是劳动力不足，缺乏技术。许多农具和工具坏了，不会修理；加工厂的人不会开动力机；木工制出了安全喷雾车，不会上螺丝；……如果按照专业专人来计算，颗粒肥料厂、农具制造修配厂、农产品联合加工厂和沼气发电站等共需要二百零九个人。可是全社总共只有六百七十六个全劳动力和半劳动力，还要搞农业生产，到哪里去找这么多技术工人来办工厂呢？这时有人主张要求县农具厂派几个技术工人来，有人主张把社里在外面当工人的抽回来。党支部研究后，认为这都不是好办法，只有克服困难，自力更生。当时，他们曾经这样考虑：“萧功梓
  （支部委员、社副主任）在很短时间内掌握了铁工、木工、钳工、绘图设计……等多种技术，被群众誉为‘万能人’。如果每个人都能学成萧功梓，问题不就解决了吗？”于是党支部提出了向萧功梓学习，开展“万能人”运动的号召。怎样才算“万能人”呢？群众讨论后订出了“万能人”的标准：男社员要学会农业生产全套技术、木匠、铁匠、石匠、泥瓦匠、开动力机、修理、设计、饲养、航行等十项；女社员要学会农业生产全套技术、勤俭持家、针线活、开动力机、用牛、修理、设计、饲养、会计、演员等十项。为了鼓励大家学习多种技术，社内决定学会五项的就授给“万能人”的光荣称号，并发给奖状。
    开始提出“万能人”标准的时候，曾经引起了一部分社员的反对，老社员林世德说：“当了一辈子庄稼汉，现在又去学手艺，一个个要闹成文不文，武不武。”富裕中农谢生米说：“这也能，那也能，门门通，门门松，样样难学会，一事都不成。”在他们看来，社员生来就是庄稼汉，其他技术是高不可攀的事。党支部便及时提出了“门门学、行行钻、样样会、件件通”，号召“人人学技术，个个成内行”。支部书记胡昌璧、副书记胡风英带头学习，抓住会前、会后的空隙，抓住下雨天和夜晚时间，到工厂里学锯木料、打铁。其他支部委员也都积极带头。不久，九个支部委员就有七个学成了“万能人”。在书记带头和影响下，许多社员都订了学习规划，抽出休息时间到工厂去学技术，全社很快就掀起了一个群众性的学技术高潮。
    为了帮助大家学好技术，党支部号召技术水平较高的社员带徒弟；帮助大家订立合同，互相学习，共同提高。党支部还号召每个社员要树立敢说、敢想、敢作的风格，要有虚心学习的精神，这样一来，社员们学技术的劲头更大了。同时，社里还根据社员们学技术、文化的迫切要求，办起了文化技术夜校和农业试验大学。人人学技术，个个争万能，在旭光一社便形成了风气。
    一人能干多样活，事情就好办了，人力也节省了。社里举办的各种厂、站，只用了六十七个人，比原计划节省了一百多人。过去农具坏了都得拿到樊口镇上去修理，既花钱，又耽误功夫，现在很多人都能自己动手修理了。
    两三个月中，全社共制造和修理了农具八百多件，制造颗粒肥料十七万多斤。党支部委员萧功又，这个二十多岁的出纳员，每次到各生产队或田间找社员们查对、清理账目或发钱的时候，帆布口袋里不但有账簿表册，还装满了弹子、皮线、螺丝、胶水、橡皮等材料，还有修理工具的老虎钳、扳手和起子，碰见谁用的胶轮板车坏了马上就地修补。社员们向他支钱或清理工分账的时候，叫他“出纳”、“会计”，找他修理车子的时候，又亲热地喊他“胶轮车专家”。
    目前，“万能人”运动正在旭光一社的所在乡——杜山乡蓬蓬勃勃的开展着，并且正在向鄂城全县推展。
