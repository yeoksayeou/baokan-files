Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference in Washington on the 6th, specifically expressing his opinions on the proposed United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting and the Middle East issue.

From Eisenhower's speech, it can be clearly seen that the United States wants to do everything possible at the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting to undermine discussions on the cessation of US-British aggression against the Middle East and the immediate withdrawal of aggressive troops from the Middle East. It also wants to reverse right and wrong and play its shameless tune of slandering others for "indirect aggression" to shirk its own guilt. At the same time, the United States is attempting to use the United Nations to push forward its set of aggressive plans for the Near and Middle East.

Eisenhower said: The United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting should not be limited to the issue of what he called the small country of Lebanon, but should include "the larger scope of the Middle East." The United States will demand consideration of the basic and fundamental causes of the continuing disputes in the Middle East. He then once again trotted out the "indirect aggression" argument painstakingly concocted by Dulles and his State Department "experts," saying that what the United States hoped for was to "prove" in the United Nations debate that "indirect aggression is the cause of the current chaos."

Eisenhower made it clear that the United States not only wants to slander the United Arab Republic but also to slander the Soviet Union for being responsible for this so-called "indirect aggression." Obviously, the identity of the aggressor and defendant being caught on the spot before the world's court of public opinion greatly annoyed this American head of state. Therefore, he shamelessly yelled that "the accusation of aggression applies to the Soviet Union and not to the United States."

Eisenhower stated that the United States will put forward the argument that the United States sent troops to Lebanon because there was "external indirect aggression" there, and that in Iraq, "indirect aggression" was also "obvious." However, he was fundamentally unable to reconcile his fabricated "argument" with the two reports of the United Nations Lebanon Observer Group, which proved that there was no "external infiltration" or "indirect aggression." Nor could he reconcile this slanderous fabrication against Iraq with the fact that the United States itself had already recognized the Republic of Iraq. Precisely because it was completely without factual basis, his trick was exposed on the spot. When a reporter asked him to explain how it could be verified that this "indirect aggression" existed, Eisenhower had to admit that it was "difficult" to prove that "indirect aggression" was the cause of the tension in the Middle East.

Regarding the issue of troop withdrawal, which is urgently demanded by worldwide public opinion, Eisenhower said that the United States would not withdraw its troops from Lebanon until the United States felt that Lebanon "no longer has the danger of indirect aggression that existed before the U.S. military entered the area." This rogue tone shows that the United States intends to have the U.S. invading forces occupy Lebanon for a long time, not allowing the people of West Asia to act according to their own will.

Eisenhower revealed that the main thing the United States wants to do at the United Nations Emergency Assembly is to promote its so-called "constructive" plan "through the United Nations." He said that the United States is prepared to participate in "some form of guarantee of the borders of Middle Eastern countries" by the United Nations, and the United States is also prepared to consider the issue of the "neutralization" of the Middle East, and there is also "economic assistance to backward areas." In this regard, he hypocritically declared that the United States not only does not take a "rigid attitude" towards Arab nationalism, but is also prepared to "help" Middle Eastern countries "realize their legitimate aspirations." However, since the United States has carried out naked military aggression in the Middle East, this mask of "friendliness" to the people of the Middle East, which has been put on again, can no longer conceal its hideous face.

### 艾森豪威尔对联大紧急会议另有企图  不谈美英罪责而要讨论难以证实的“间接侵略”  在撤军问题上要无赖企图使美军长期侵占黎巴嫩

    艾森豪威尔对联大紧急会议另有企图
    不谈美英罪责而要讨论难以证实的“间接侵略”
    在撤军问题上要无赖企图使美军长期侵占黎巴嫩
    新华社7日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔6日在华盛顿举行了记者招待会，专门对拟议中的联合国大会紧急会议问题和中东问题发表了意见。
    从艾森豪威尔的发言中可以清楚地看出，美国要在联合国大会紧急会议上全力破坏关于停止美英对中东的侵略和立即把侵略军队撤出中东的问题的讨论，并且要颠倒是非大弹其诬蔑别人“间接侵略”的无耻滥调来推卸自己的罪责。同时，美国还企图利用联合国来推行它对中近东的一套侵略计划。
    艾森豪威尔说：联合国大会紧急会议不应当仅限于他所说的小小黎巴嫩的问题，而应当包括“中东更大的范围”，美国将要求考虑所谓引起中东地区继续不断地发生纠纷的基本和根本原因。他接着就再次搬出杜勒斯及其国务院“专家”们苦心泡制出来的“间接侵略”的论点，他说，美国所希望的就是要在联合国的辩论中“证明”：“间接侵略是造成目前混乱的原因”。
    艾森豪威尔表明，美国不仅要诬蔑阿拉伯联合共和国，而且要诬蔑苏联应对这种所谓“间接侵略”负责。显然，在世界舆论法庭前被当场拿获的侵略者和被告者的身份，使这位美国首脑大为懊恼，因此，他无耻地叫嚷什么“侵略的指责适用于苏联而不适用于美国”。
    艾森豪威尔表示，美国将提出这样的论调：美国派兵到黎巴嫩去是因为那里有“外界的间接侵略”，而在伊拉克，“间接侵略”也是“明显”的。但是他根本无法把他所捏造的这种“论据”同联合国黎巴嫩观察团证明并不存在什么“外界渗入”和“间接侵略”的两个报告调和起来，他也没有办法把他对伊拉克的这种诬蔑性谰言同美国自己已经承认伊拉克共和国这个事实调和起来。正是由于毫无事实根据，他的把戏当场就露出了马脚。当记者要求他说明怎样能够证实这种
  “间接侵略”的存在时，艾森豪威尔也不得不承认，要证实“间接侵略”是中东紧张局势的原因是“有困难”的。
    对于全世界舆论迫切要求的撤军问题，艾森豪威尔说，在美国感到黎巴嫩“不再存在美军进入该区以前的那种间接侵略的危险”以前，美国不会把它的军队撤出黎巴嫩。这种无赖的口吻说明美国打算使美国侵略军长期侵占黎巴嫩，不许西亚各国人民按照他们自己的意旨办事。
    艾森豪威尔透露，美国在联合国紧急大会中所要做的主要事情是要“通过联合国”来推行他所谓“建设性”的计划。他说，美国准备参加联合国对“中东各国边界的某种形式的保证”，美国也准备考虑中东“中立化”的问题，而且还有对“落后地区提供经济援助”。在这方面，他特别伪善地声明，美国对阿拉伯民族主义不但不采取“刻板的态度”，而且准备“帮助”中东国家“实现他们的合法愿望”。但是，自从美国在中东进行赤裸裸的军事侵略以后，这种重新戴上的对中东人民“友好”的假面具再也不能掩盖它的狰狞面目了。
