Rejuvenating the Canal
The project to dredge the Grand Canal is about to commence in full swing. Construction has already begun in many areas. This Grand Canal, which stretches over 1,500 kilometers and has been silted up for more than a century, will regain its youth in this era of the Great Leap Forward. It will connect the Hai River, the Yellow River, the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and the Qiantang River, forming a vast waterway network, allowing boats to travel across most of China. At that time, we will be able to travel by 2,000-ton ships from Beijing through Hangzhou to the Qiantang River. (Attached picture)

　　让运河回春
　　疏浚大运河的工程即将全面动工。目前许多地区已开始施工。这条长达一千五百多公里的大运河，已经淤塞一百多年，在这个大跃进的年代里，它将青春重回。它将把海河、黄河、淮河、长江和钱塘江联结起来，构成一个巨大的水运网，使大半个中国互通舟楫。那时候，我们可以坐着二千吨的船只，从北京过杭州，到钱塘江。（附图片）
