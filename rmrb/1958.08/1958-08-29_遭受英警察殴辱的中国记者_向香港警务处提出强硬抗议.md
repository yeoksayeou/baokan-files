    Lodge Strong Protest with Hong Kong Police Department
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 28th: Hong Kong News: Thirteen Chinese journalists who were assaulted and humiliated by British police in Hong Kong, together visited Maxwell, the head of the Hong Kong British Police Department, today, strongly protesting the Hong Kong British police's violence against the personal safety of news workers.
    Maxwell did not receive the journalists, only sending a Deputy Superintendent, Huang Yongxian, to represent him. The journalists said to Huang Yongxian: We believe that the Hong Kong British police's unreasonable assault and humiliation of journalists is a very serious incident, therefore, we want to lodge a strong protest. The thirteen Chinese journalists handed over a protest letter to Maxwell to Huang Yongxian on the spot, asking Huang Yongxian to be responsible for forwarding the journalists' protest letter to Maxwell, and demanding that Maxwell make a quick reply.
    The Chinese journalists' protest letter to Maxwell said, "We hereby lodge a solemn protest with you, protesting your department's armed police officers' rude interference with press freedom, obstruction of interview work, and hostility towards the Chinese people's news undertakings; protesting your department's armed police officers' unreasonable assault and humiliation of journalists and infringement of human rights. We also declare to you that your department must bear full responsibility for this violent incident, and we hereby put forward the following demands: 1. Punish the perpetrators; 2. Compensate us for our losses; 3. The Police Department apologizes to us; 4. Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future."
