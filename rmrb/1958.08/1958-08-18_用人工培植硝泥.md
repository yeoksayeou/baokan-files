　　Artificially Cultivating Saltpeter Mud
    Xinhua News Agency: Employees of the Dazhou County Native Produce and Waste Products Management Department in Sichuan Province have recently successfully cultivated saltpeter mud, a raw material for making local saltpeter, providing an inexhaustible source of raw materials for the mass production of local saltpeter. Currently, each district in the county is building small local saltpeter factories with a daily output of 500 to 1,000 jin, planning to produce 3.2 million jin of local saltpeter this year using artificial cultivation methods.
    Local saltpeter is one of the main raw materials for manufacturing gunpowder. Water conservancy construction, mountain mining, and road construction all require local saltpeter to manufacture gunpowder. In the past, saltpeter was mainly extracted from natural saltpeter mud in various parts of Sichuan, but after long-term and large-scale excavation, natural saltpeter mud has gradually decreased, failing to meet the needs of saltpeter production.

　　用人工培植硝泥
    据新华社讯　四川省达县土产废品经理部职工最近用人工培植土硝原料——硝泥成功，为大量生产土硝提供了取之不尽、用之不竭的原料。目前全县各区正在兴建日产五百到一千斤的小土硝厂，计划今年用人工培植方法生产土硝三百二十万斤。
    土硝是制造火药的主要原料之一，兴修水利、开山采矿、修筑道路都需要土硝来制造火药。过去四川各地熬硝主要是靠挖掘天然硝泥，但经过长期大量挖掘，天然硝泥日渐减少，不能满足制硝的需要。
