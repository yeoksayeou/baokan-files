Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: In the great leap forward of socialist construction, ethnic minorities in various regions are boldly breaking down superstitions and heresies, and shaking off the shackles of thousands of years of outdated customs and bad habits. This great torrent of ideological liberation is promoting the production and construction of ethnic minority areas to develop at an even faster rate.

After the rectification campaign and socialist education movement, the broad masses of ethnic minorities realized that superstitious taboos and outdated customs were serious obstacles on the road to national development and were detrimental to the socialist cause, and they demanded reform. For example, in Leishan County, Guizhou Province, the Miao people used to have more than sixty kinds of superstitious taboos. They were afraid of damaging the "dragon vein" when building water conservancy projects; when crops suffered from insect pests, they could only pray to gods and ghosts; more than 100 days a year could not be used for production because of memorial days and festivals. This year, in the great debate, the Miao people exposed and criticized bad people and bad deeds that used superstition to undermine production, and recognized that superstition and bad customs were tools used by the reactionary classes in the past to enslave and fool the working people. Now, the Miao people in this county have reformed some customs that are harmful to production, while maintaining good habits such as the "Lusheng Dance."

The ethnic minorities, who had shattered their mental shackles, were no longer afraid of nature and unleashed the power to open mountains and break ground. In Longlin Autonomous County of Various Nationalities in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, during the high tide of accumulating fertilizer, the masses of Kabai Township launched a battle to extract fertilizer from the "Immortal Cave," with youth commando teams taking the lead, digging out rock mud and bat droppings accumulated over thousands of years from the cave. In the "Superstition Gully," where no one had ever dared to dig a shovel of soil, people dug out 210,000 dan of fertile soil in four days. They said: Superstition cannot produce more grain; only by stepping up production can we live a good life. After breaking down superstitious ideas, the ethnic minorities fully believed that human power could overcome nature. A new Yao folk song sings: There are no gods in heaven and no immortals on earth; the people who have turned over are living gods. With the leadership of the Party, we can hold up the sky with one hand.

In changing customs and habits, the progressive and conservative factions among many ethnic minorities have launched a fierce struggle. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, the story of the Dai girl Yu Ai Yang taking the lead in breaking the superstition that women cannot plow the fields is widely circulated. Yu Ai Yang is the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. After attending the Autonomous Prefecture's Youth Representative Conference, she decided to respond to the Party's call and take the lead in plowing the fields and working like men. At this time, the conservatives immediately attacked her, saying, "The grain grown by women plowing the fields is not eaten even by the Buddha," and "If women plow the fields, men will be useless." But Yu Ai Yang ignored these taunts and attacks and insisted on plowing the fields. Because she plowed the land deeply and managed it well, this field yielded fifteen more *dan* of grain than the nearby field of the same area. The CCP County Committee awarded Yu Ai Yang a model red flag and called on Dai women to learn from her. This year, more Dai women in the Autonomous Prefecture are plowing the fields, and more than 360 Dai women in nine townships have learned to plow the fields. The Miao people of Zhaitou Township in Sansui County, Guizhou Province, more thoroughly defeated the conservative and superstitious factions in the great debate. According to the plans of the "Ghost Masters," "Guzang Heads" and some wealthy peasants in the township, they would follow the old habits this year and eat Guzang again (that is, slaughter cattle, eat and drink heavily, and not engage in production), and in the next three years, they would have seven major festivals every year, fighting cattle a total of 102 times in three years, and every household would invite guests to eat and drink at this time. However, this year, the poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely demanded a change in this old habit. They said: Eating Guzang for one year will not clear the debt for ten years. Based on the demands of the masses, the Party branch led everyone to launch a great debate, calculating three wasteful accounts: First, if the entire township wants to eat Guzang, it will have to kill 160 head of large water buffalo, worth a total of 40,000 yuan, with an average burden of more than 69 yuan per household; second, during the three years of eating Guzang, there will be seven major festivals and bullfights every year, and guests will be invited to eat, totaling more than 600,000 jin of rice; third, during the three years of eating Guzang, more than 400,000 workdays will be wasted. After this great debate, the people of the entire township greatly improved their consciousness, and everyone was unwilling to maintain the old habit of "eating Guzang." People who did not dare to openly propose reforming customs and habits also spoke boldly. Some said, "What is praying to gods and ghosts, no one who prays to gods and ghosts has ever received a needle or thread!" Some said, "With Chairman Mao's leadership, as long as everyone is of one mind and steps up production, everything can be done well." Now, the township's "Guzang" cattle and "Protect the Family" cattle have all been included in the cooperative, the money originally intended to buy Guzang cattle has been used as production funds, and the former "Guzang Heads" have also dedicated the gongs and drums used to worship ghosts and gods to the agricultural cooperative.

After breaking down superstitions and abandoning backward customs, a new atmosphere has emerged everywhere among ethnic minorities. People of the Dong, Yao, Miao, Tujia and other ethnic groups in Hunan Province have all changed the past "memorial days" into production days. In the past, ethnic minorities in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture would slaughter cattle to sacrifice to ghosts and invite shamans to chant scriptures when they were sick. This year, all major townships in the prefecture have established health stations, and they go to doctors when they are sick. The Autonomous Prefecture also proposed to achieve four "no's" before National Day. In the past, the fields in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, were not fertilized, saying that if fertilizer was applied, the eyes would go blind and the legs would hurt, but this year, toilets have begun to be dug everywhere, and the fields in the plains, hills, and high mountains have been universally fertilized.

　　天没神来地没仙  人民就是活神仙
    少数民族大破迷信阔步前进
    新华社21日讯  各地少数民族在社会主义建设大跃进中，大胆破除迷信邪说，摆脱千百年来陈俗陋习的束缚。这股思想大解放的巨流，正促使少数民族地区的生产建设以更快的速度向前发展。
    广大少数民族人民经过整风和社会主义教育运动以后，认识到迷信禁忌和陈俗陋习是民族发展道路上的严重障碍，不利于社会主义事业，纷纷要求改革。例如，贵州雷山县苗族过去就有六十多种迷信禁忌。兴修水利怕挖坏了“龙脉”；庄稼遭受虫灾只能求神敬鬼；一年当中因为忌日和过节日，就有一百天以上不能参加生产。今年苗族群众在大辩论中，揭露和批判了利用迷信邪说破坏生产的坏人坏事，认清了迷信和不良的风俗习惯是过去反动阶级用来奴役和愚昧劳动人民的工具。现在这个县的苗族人民已改革了一些对生产有害的习俗，而保持了“跳芦笙”等优良的习惯。
    粉碎了精神上的枷锁的少数民族人民，在大自然面前再也无所畏惧，发出了开山辟地的威力。广西僮族自治区隆林各族自治县在积肥高潮中，卡百乡群众发起了向“神仙洞”索肥的战斗，由青年突击队带头打冲锋，从洞里挖出千年积下的岩泥和蝙蝠粪。在从来没有人敢动一锹土的“迷信沟”，人们四天内就挖出肥土二十一万担。他们说：迷信不能多打粮食，加紧生产，才能过好日子。少数民族人民在破除迷信思想以后，完全相信人的力量可以战胜自然。瑶族的新山歌唱道：天没神来地没仙，翻了身的人民就是神仙，咱们有了党领导，一只手就能托着天。
    在移风易俗中，许多少数民族中的促进派和保守派，曾经展开了一番激烈的斗争。在云南西双版纳傣族自治州，到处传颂着傣族姑娘玉艾养带头打破妇女不能犁地的迷信的故事。玉艾养是共青团支部副书记，她参加自治州的青年代表会议以后，决心响应党的号召，带头下地犁田，和男人一样劳动生产。这时，保守派立即向她进行攻击，说什么“女人犁田长出的谷子连佛爷也不吃”，“女人犁田，男人就没有用处了”。但是玉艾养不顾这些嘲笑和打击，坚持犁地。由于她把地犁得深，管理得好，这块田比附近同样面积的田多收了十五挑谷。中共县委奖给玉艾养一面模范红旗，号召傣族妇女向她学习。今年，自治州的傣族妇女犁田的多起来了，九个乡有三百六十多个傣族妇女学会犁田。贵州三穗县寨头乡的苗族人民，在大辩论中更彻底打败了保守派和迷信派。按照乡里“鬼师”、“牯脏头”和一些富裕农民的打算，今年又要按老习惯吃牯脏了（即宰牛大吃大喝，不搞生产），并且在今后三年内，每年要过七个大节，三年共斗牛一百零二次，每家在这个时候都要请客人吃喝。但是，贫农和下中农今年坚决要求改变这种旧习惯，他们说：吃一年牯脏，十年还不清账。党支部根据群众的要求，领导大家展开大辩论，算出了三笔浪费账：第一，全乡如果要吃牯脏，就要杀掉一百六十头大水牯，共值四万元，平均每户负担六十九元多；第二，吃牯脏的三年内，每年要过七个大节和斗牛，大小节日要请客人吃饭，共要大米六十多万斤；第三，吃牯脏的三年内，要浪费四十多万个工作日。全乡人民经过这次大辩论后，觉悟大大提高，大家都不愿意再保持“吃牯脏”的老习惯。原来不敢公开提改革风俗习惯的人也大胆说话了，有的说：“什么求神敬鬼，没有一个求神敬鬼的人得过一针一线！”有的说：“有毛主席领导，只要大家一条心，加劲生产，样样都能搞好。”现在，这个乡的“牯脏”牛、“保家”牛已全部入了社，原来准备买牯脏牛的钱被当作生产资金用起来了，过去的“牯脏头”也把敬鬼神的锣鼓献给了农业社。
    少数民族人民在破除迷信和抛弃了落后习俗以后，到处出现一片新的气象。湖南省侗、瑶、苗、土家等族人民都把过去的“忌日”改为生产日。海南黎族苗族自治州的少数民族在过去生病时便杀牛祭鬼，请巫师念经，今年全州各大乡都设立了卫生站，有病便找医生看。这个自治州还提出在国庆节前做到四无。四川凉山彝族自治州的田地过去不施肥料，说施了肥以后眼要瞎、腿会疼，但是今年各地开始挖厕所，平坝、平山、高山的田地已经普遍施肥。（附图片）
