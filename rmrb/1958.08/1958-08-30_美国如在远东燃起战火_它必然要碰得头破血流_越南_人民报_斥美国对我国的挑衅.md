Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 29th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today, denouncing the United States for creating tension in the Taiwan area.

The commentary pointed out that after the United States carried out armed intervention in Lebanon, it immediately instigated the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out provocations in the Taiwan Strait area. This not only seriously threatens China's security, but also seriously threatens Asia's security.

The commentary emphasized that Jinmen and Matsu Islands, like Taiwan, are Chinese territory, and resolving the issues of these places is entirely within the purview of the People's Republic of China. The United States' recent intensification of tension in the Taiwan area, in addition to realizing its aggressive designs, also has another purpose, which is to try to divert the world's people's attention from the U.S. invasion of the Middle East and divert the world's people's attention from the struggle demanding that the U.S. and Britain implement the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Meeting to immediately withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The commentary said that if the United States dares to ignite war in the Taiwan area, it will certainly suffer crushing defeat at the hands of the 600 million Chinese people who are determined to defend their territorial integrity and defend peace.

　　美国如在远东燃起战火  它必然要碰得头破血流
    越南“人民报”斥美国对我国的挑衅
    新华社河内29日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论，斥责美国在台湾地区制造紧张局势。
    评论指出，美国在对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉之后，紧接着又嗾使蒋介石集团在台湾海峡一带进行挑衅。这不仅严重地威胁了中国的安全，同时也严重地威胁着亚洲的安全。
    评论强调指出，金门和马祖岛同台湾一样都是中国的领土，解决这些地方的问题完全是中华人民共和国的权限内的事情。而美国最近在台湾地区加紧制造紧张局势，除了为实现它的侵略图谋之外还有另外的目的，这就是企图转移世界人民对美国在中近东进行侵略的行动的注意，转移世界人民要求美英两国执行联合国大会紧急会议的决议来立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的侵略军队的斗争的注意。
    评论说，如果美国敢于在台湾一带燃起战火，它就一定会在决心保卫自己领土完整和保卫和平的中国六亿人民面前碰得头破血流。
