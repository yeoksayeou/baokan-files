    Welcoming Distinguished Guests from Pyongyang
    The government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Vice Premier of the Cabinet Comrade Li Zhouyuan, arrives in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country, bringing with them the profound friendship of the brotherly Korean people towards the Chinese people. Our government and people warmly welcome the distinguished guests from Pyongyang. In February this year, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai visited Korea; in May this year, the Korean people's delegation to China, led by Minister of Justice of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Xu Zhenyu, visited our country; and now we once again welcome the representatives of the Korean government. The frequent exchanges between our two governments and peoples are a sign of the continuous strengthening and consolidation of the unbreakable friendship between our two countries.
    The Korean people, who heroically defeated the American aggressors in the Fatherland Liberation War, have also achieved brilliant accomplishments in the five years of post-war peaceful construction. We are thrilled to see that, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and with the assistance of fraternal countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean people have rapidly healed the wounds of war, restored the economy destroyed by the artillery fire of American imperialism, victoriously completed the post-war three-year plan, and are in the process of completing the first five-year plan for developing the people's economy. In 1957, the total industrial output value of Korea had increased to 2.8 times that of 1949 before the war. Korea's agricultural production is also developing rapidly on a new technical and economic foundation. Today, Korea has successfully completed agricultural collectivization, with 98.6% of farmers joining agricultural cooperatives. The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production in Korea has laid a solid foundation for building socialism in the northern half of Korea. Now, the Korean people have mounted the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse) and are leaping forward towards the socialist goal. After the realization of the first five-year plan (1957 to 1961), the problems of food, clothing, and housing for the Korean people can be basically solved. The brilliant achievements made by the Korean people in the short five years after the war fully demonstrate the infinite vitality of the socialist system established in the northern half of Korea and the great strength of the Korean people who have gained national independence. The spirit of hard struggle displayed by the Korean people in peaceful construction, like the spirit of heroic struggle they displayed in the anti-American aggression war, has greatly inspired and continues to inspire the people of our country in the great leap forward of socialist construction. Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The strong will and hardworking spirit displayed by the Korean people in the struggle against aggression and in peaceful construction are examples that the Chinese people often learn from."
    China and Korea are close neighbors, and the Chinese and Korean people are the closest friends and brothers. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is forged in blood. For a long time, our two peoples have fought side by side and advanced together in the struggle against common enemies. In the successive revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan in China, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives to support the Chinese people. When American imperialism ignited the flames of war in Korea and threatened China's security, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people also formed the Volunteers and went to the Korean front to carry out the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homeland. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the political, economic, and cultural relations between China and Korea have greatly developed. Our two peoples assist each other and cooperate with each other in international affairs and in economic and cultural construction. This visit of the Korean government delegation to our country will conduct talks with our government on the issue of further strengthening economic cooperation between the two countries. We firmly believe that this meeting will achieve the expected results. The continuous development of the friendly relations between the Chinese and Korean people not only promotes the peaceful construction of the two countries but also strengthens the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the power of the people of all countries to defend peace.
    China and Korea are both countries guided by Marxism-Leninism and are members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our two peoples have always strived to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp. Delegations from the Chinese and Korean parties both participated in the conference of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries held in Moscow in November last year. This conference and the declaration it adopted further strengthened the unity of the socialist camp and made a major contribution to the socialist cause and the cause of world peace in all countries. Recently, the parties of China and Korea have waged a resolute struggle to defend Marxism-Leninism and oppose modern revisionism.
    The Chinese and Korean people have always struggled for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for the maintenance of peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese and Korean sides have strictly abided by the Korean Armistice Agreement and have done everything possible to consolidate the Korean armistice. According to the agreement between China and Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers are withdrawing from Korea in batches and will be completely withdrawn by the end of this year. This measure once again demonstrates the utmost sincerity and confidence of the Korean and Chinese sides in peacefully resolving the Korean issue. However, the US side has consistently violated the armistice agreement and recently illegally brought atomic weapons into South Korea, continuing to create tension in the region. The Chinese and Korean people, who smashed the paper tiger of American imperialism in the Korean War, are not afraid of any intimidation or war adventure by American imperialism. The governments of China and Korea have issued separate statements, firmly supporting the struggle of the Arab people for national independence, protesting against the US and Britain for setting fires in the Middle East, demanding that the US and British aggressor troops immediately withdraw from the Middle East, and solemnly warning the US and British aggressors that if they provoke war regardless of the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, they will inevitably burn themselves by playing with fire.
    As we warmly welcome our Korean guests with excitement, we once again express our best wishes: may the unbreakable brotherly friendship forged in blood by the Chinese and Korean people become even closer; may the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union be further consolidated!

    欢迎来自平壤的贵宾
    以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相李周渊同志为首的朝鲜政府代表团，带着兄弟般的朝鲜人民对中国人民的崇高友情，前来我国进行友好访问，今日到达北京。我国政府和人民热烈欢迎来自平壤的贵宾。今年2月间，以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团访问了朝鲜；今年5月间，由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国司法相许贞琡率领的朝鲜人民访华代表团访问了我国；现在我们再一次欢迎了朝鲜政府的代表。我们两国政府之间和人民之间的频繁往来，是我们两国兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊不断加强和巩固的标志。
    在祖国解放战争中英勇地战胜了美国侵略者的朝鲜人民，在战后五年的和平建设中又取得了辉煌的成就。我们兴奋地看到：朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的援助下，迅速地医治了战争创伤，恢复了被美帝国主义侵略炮火所摧毁的经济，胜利地完成了战后三年计划和正在完成发展人民经济的第一个五年计划。1957年朝鲜工业的总产值已增加到战前1949年的二点八倍。朝鲜的农业生产也正在新的技术和经济基础上迅速发展。今天朝鲜已经顺利地完成了农业合作化，已有98.6％的农户加入了农业合作社。朝鲜工农业生产的迅速发展，已奠定了在朝鲜北半部建设社会主义的巩固基础。现在，朝鲜人民已跨上了千里马，向着社会主义目标飞跃前进。在第一个五年计划（1957年到1961年）实现以后，朝鲜人民的衣食住问题就可以基本上获得解决。朝鲜人民在战后短短五年中所获得的辉煌成就，充分显示了朝鲜北半部建立的社会主义制度的无限生命力和获得了民族独立的朝鲜人民的巨大力量。朝鲜人民在和平建设中表现的艰苦奋斗的精神，正如他们在反美侵略战争中所表现的英勇斗争的精神一样，大大鼓舞了和鼓舞着在社会主义建设大跃进中的我国人民。周恩来总理说过：“朝鲜人民在反侵略斗争中和和平建设中表现出来的坚强意志和苦干精神，都是中国人民经常学习的榜样。”
    中国和朝鲜是亲邻，中国人民和朝鲜人民是最亲密的朋友和兄弟。中朝两国人民的友谊是用鲜血凝成的。长期以来，我们两国人民就在反抗共同敌人的斗争中并肩作战，共同前进。在中国人民历次革命战争中和抗日战争中，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女不惜牺牲生命支援中国人民。当美帝国主义在朝鲜燃起战火，并且威胁中国安全的时候，中国人民的优秀儿女也组成了志愿军，开到朝鲜前线去进行了抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争。中华人民共和国成立以后，中朝两国的政治、经济和文化关系有了很大的发展。我们两国人民在国际事务中和在经济文化建设中，都互相援助，彼此合作。这次朝鲜政府代表团访问我国，将就进一步加强两国经济协作问题同我国政府进行会谈。我们深信这次会谈将会达到预期的结果。中朝两国人民友好关系的不断发展，不仅促进了两国的和平建设，而且加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力和各国人民保卫和平的力量。
    中朝两国都是以马克思列宁主义为指导思想的国家，都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员。我们两国人民一向为加强社会主义阵营的团结而努力。中朝两国党的代表团都参加了去年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党的代表会议，这个会议和它所通过的宣言，进一步加强了社会主义阵营的团结，对各国社会主义事业和世界和平事业作出了重大的贡献。最近时期，中朝两国的党都为捍卫马克思列宁主义、反对现代修正主义而进行了坚决的斗争。
    中朝两国人民一向为和平解决朝鲜问题和维护远东与世界和平而斗争。中朝方面严格遵守朝鲜停战协定，并竭尽一切努力巩固朝鲜的停战。根据中朝双方的协议，中国人民志愿军正在分批撤出朝鲜，并将于今年年底以前全部撤退完毕。这一措施再一次表现了朝中方面和平解决朝鲜问题的最大的诚意和信心。然而，美方却一贯地破坏停战协定，近来更把原子武器非法运入南朝鲜，继续制造这一地区的紧张局势。曾在朝鲜战争中打烂美帝国主义纸老虎的中朝人民，决不害怕美帝国主义的任何恫吓和战争冒险。中朝两国政府已经分别发表声明，坚决支持阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的斗争，抗议美英在中东放火，要求美英侵略军立即撤出中东，并且严正警告美英侵略者：如果不顾全世界人民的和平愿望而挑起战争，必将玩火自焚。
    在我们怀着兴奋的心情热烈欢迎我们的朝鲜贵宾的时候，我们再一次表示最好的祝愿：愿中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的牢不可破的兄弟友谊更加亲密；愿以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结更加巩固！
