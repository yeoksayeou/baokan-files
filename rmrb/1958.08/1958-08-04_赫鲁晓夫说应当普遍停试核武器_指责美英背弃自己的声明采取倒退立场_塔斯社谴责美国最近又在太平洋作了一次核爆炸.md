Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: According to TASS, Moscow, August 3rd: In a letter to the chairman of the "British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament," Collins, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, said that since nuclear weapon tests are still being carried out, humanity is subjected to a constant and increasing threat in peacetime, and the United States' "brink of war" policy constantly risks pushing humanity into the abyss of world armed conflict, now is the time to end this situation forever.

He also said that we hope that reason will ultimately prevail, and nuclear weapon tests should be universally stopped.

Collins had written to Khrushchev, mentioning that there were reports that negotiations on the supervision and monitoring of hydrogen bomb tests might be cancelled, and he expressed his concern about this news.

In his reply, Khrushchev wrote that the Soviet government believed from the beginning that the experts' meeting would only be meaningful and effective if it could guarantee the immediate and universal cessation of nuclear weapon tests. Otherwise, this meeting would have no practical value.

Khrushchev continued, it is not difficult to see that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles attempted to separate the work of the experts' meeting from the task of stopping nuclear tests, as can be seen from his remarks at a press conference on July 17th of this year. His approach is actually a regression from the position stated in U.S. President Eisenhower's letter to the Soviet government. As everyone knows, the U.S. President once wrote that an agreement must be reached on the issue of supervising the cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests. Khrushchev said that just as the experts' meeting has already begun its work in Geneva, the U.S. and British governments have gone back on their own clear statements regarding the purpose and task of the experts' meeting, which cannot but bring unnecessary difficulties to the matter.

Khrushchev pointed out that recent events cannot be said to demonstrate that the U.S. and British governments are concerned about easing international tensions. The U.S. and British aggression in the Near East clearly proves this. Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet government believes that urgent international issues, including the issues of the Middle East, can and must be resolved peacefully.

Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: TASS, Moscow, August 2nd: TASS commentator Orlov wrote that the United States conducted another nuclear explosion in the Pacific on August 1st, which indicates that it has not considered the issue of stopping nuclear weapon tests. These tests greatly increase the amount of radioactive dust in the world and the various adverse consequences for humanity resulting from it.

The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the U.S. Department of Defense publicly announced this explosion. However, as everyone knows, U.S. official agencies are far from having told the public about all the explosions they have conducted far from their own coast, but in areas close to various Asian countries.

For example, on July 26th, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission announced that they had conducted the fourth atomic nuclear explosion in a series of unprecedented nuclear tests in the Pacific that are currently underway. However, during this testing period, that is, from April to July 26th, Soviet observation stations observed that the United States had already conducted thirty-two nuclear explosions in the Pacific.

How can we explain the huge difference between the two nuclear explosion figures published by the U.S. and Soviet scientific institutions? Perhaps, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's observations of U.S. explosions in the Pacific are not as good as those of Soviet scientific stations five or six thousand kilometers away?

This possibility certainly does not exist. It can quickly be guessed that the relevant U.S. authorities are trying to conceal from the world public and American citizens the truth about a series of explosion tests they are now conducting at an unprecedented pace. If the public accurately knew the shockingly high number of nuclear explosions conducted by the United States, it would immediately expose which country is committing a crime against humanity and who is stubbornly continuing the nuclear weapons race, threatening humanity, and contaminating the atmosphere with radioactive dust.

Furthermore, the U.S. authorities have not said a word about the figures listed by the Soviet observation stations. This is not surprising, because if U.S. officials admitted that they had concealed from the public most of the nuclear explosion tests they had conducted, they would ultimately have to admit that all nuclear explosions can be observed and recorded by existing scientific observation stations. This conclusive fact might force them to admit that it is actually possible to conclude an agreement on the unconditional and immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. This is precisely what U.S. foreign policy is deliberately trying to avoid.

### 赫鲁晓夫说应当普遍停试核武器  指责美英背弃自己的声明采取倒退立场  塔斯社谴责美国最近又在太平洋作了一次核爆炸

    赫鲁晓夫说应当普遍停试核武器
    指责美英背弃自己的声明采取倒退立场
    塔斯社谴责美国最近又在太平洋作了一次核爆炸
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在给“英国争取裁减核武器运动”主席柯林斯的复信中说，由于至今还在继续进行核武器试验，人类在和平时期就遭受到经常的、越来越大的威胁，而美国的“战争边缘”政策经常有把人类推入世界武装冲突深渊的危险，现在是永远结束这种状况的时候了。
    他又说，我们希望，理智终将获得胜利，核武器试验应当普遍停止。
    柯林斯曾经写信给赫鲁晓夫，提到有消息说监督和监察氢弹试验的谈判可能被取消，他对这个消息表示不安。
    赫鲁晓夫在复信中写道，苏联政府在一开始就认为，专家会议只有在它能保证立刻普遍地停止核武器试验的情况下才会有意义和作用。否则，这个会议就没有什么实际价值。
    赫鲁晓夫继续写道，不难看出，美国国务卿杜勒斯企图把专家会议的工作同停止核试验的任务割裂开来，从他今年7月17日在记者招待会上的谈话中可以看出这一点。他的这种做法实际上就是从美国总统艾森豪威尔致苏联政府的信中所陈述的立场倒退了。大家知道，美国总统曾经写过，必须就监督停止原子弹和氢弹的试验问题达成协议。赫鲁晓夫说，正当专家会议已经在日内瓦着手工作的今天，美英两国政府背弃了它们自己关于专家会议的目的和任务的明确声明，这不能不给事情带来不必要的困难。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，最近的事件决不能说明美英两国政府是关心缓和国际紧张局势的。美英侵略近东就清楚地证明了这一点。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联政府认为，包括中近东问题在内的迫切的国际问题可以而且必须用和平方式解决。
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社莫斯科2日电：塔斯社评论员奥尔洛夫写道，8月1日，美国又在太平洋进行了一次核爆炸，这表示它没有考虑停止核武器试验的问题。这些试验使世界上的放射性微尘以及由此而产生的对人类的种种不良后果大大增加。
    美国原子能委员会和美国国防部公开宣布了这次爆炸。但是，大家知道，美国官方机构远还没有把他们在远离本国海岸、但是紧邻亚洲大陆各国的地区所进行的一切爆炸告诉公众。
    譬如，7月26日美国原子能委员会宣布，他们在太平洋进行了现在正在继续的一系列史无先例的核试验中的第四次原子核爆炸。但是，在这段试验期间，即从4月到7月26日为止，苏联观测站观测到美国已经在太平洋进行了三十二次核爆炸。
    怎样来解释美国和苏联科学机构所发表的这两种核爆炸数字之间的巨大差别呢？也许，美国原子能委员会对美国在太平洋进行爆炸所作的观察还不如远在五、六千公里之外的苏联科学站吧？
    这种可能性当然是不存在的。很快就能猜想得到，美国有关当局在世界公众和美国公民面前正在力图掩盖他们现在正在空前紧张进行的一系列爆炸试验的真象。如果让公众精确地知道了美国进行核爆炸的次数多到如此惊人的程度，就会马上暴露，到底是哪一个国家在对人类犯罪，是谁顽固地继续进行核武器竞赛以威胁人类，使大气沾染上放射性微尘。
    此外，美国当局对于苏联观测站所列举的数字却一字不提。这也毫不足怪，因为，如果美国官方人士承认他们对公众隐瞒了他们所进行的大部分核爆炸试验的话，他们最终就不能不承认，一切核爆炸都是能够观测得到的，都能够利用现有的科学观测站把它们记录下来的。这种确凿的事实可能会使他们承认实际上有可能缔结关于毫无条件地立即停止原子武器和氢武器试验的协定。美国外交政策处心积虑地要规避的正是这一点。
