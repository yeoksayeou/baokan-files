Sea Salt's Big Harvest in the Off-Season

    (Reported by our newspaper) July and August are usually the rainy season in the north and are also prone to typhoons in the south, which has historically made them the off-season for sea salt production. This July, under the great leap forward situation, workers in various salt fields created an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to statistics, the country produced more than 984,000 tons of raw salt in July, an increase of 45% compared with the same month in the bumper year of 1957.
