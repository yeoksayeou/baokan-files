Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, August 5th: Mexican railway workers recently held a general strike to protest the railway authorities' violation of labor union laws. Approximately 108,000 people participated in the strike.

The strike has brought Mexico's railway transportation to a standstill. On August 3rd, the Mexican government mobilized troops to confront the striking masses and threatened to fire workers who did not report to work. On August 4th, the government dispatched troops to occupy all railway facilities and suppressed the striking workers. At the central station in Mexico City, the army even opened fire on striking workers, resulting in one worker's death and two others injured.

Simultaneous with the railway workers' strike, national telecommunications workers in Mexico also began a strike on August 5th, protesting the authorities' arrest of leaders of the telecommunications workers' union. The strike has disrupted domestic and international telecommunications in Mexico.

    墨西哥十万铁路工人罢工
    政府当局竟出动军队镇压
    据新华社5日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥的铁路员工最近举行总罢工，抗议铁路当局破坏工会法。参加罢工的人数约有十万八千人。
    这次罢工已经使墨西哥的铁路交通陷于停顿。墨西哥政府在3日调动军队来对付罢工的群众，并且威胁说要开除不上班的工人。4日，政府出动军队占领了所有铁路设施，并对罢工工人实行镇压。在墨西哥城的中央车站，军队竟向罢工工人开枪，有一个工人死亡，另两个工人受伤。
    同铁路工人罢工同时，墨西哥全国电讯工人也在5日起罢工，抗议当局逮捕电讯工人工会的领袖。罢工使得墨西哥国内和国际的电讯来往中断。
