Xinhua News Agency, August 15th dispatch from TASS: The outstanding French physicist and social activist, recipient of the International Lenin Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations," Chairman of the World Peace Council, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and honorary chairman of the "France-USSR" Association, Professor Frédéric Joliot-Curie, passed away in Paris on the 14th after a serious illness, at the age of fifty-eight.

According to reports, Joliot-Curie was admitted to a hospital in Paris on the 11th of this month, where he underwent surgery. His condition deteriorated on the afternoon of the 13th. Although there was a slight improvement that evening, he finally passed away on the evening of the 14th.

While Joliot-Curie was ill, he received a large number of letters and telegrams of condolences from French social figures and representatives of the working people.

Joliot-Curie

Joliot-Curie was an outstanding French physicist, one of the most prominent scientists in the field of nuclear physics, and a staunch fighter for the defense of world peace. He was born in 1900.

Joliot-Curie, along with his wife Irène Curie, discovered artificial radioactivity and conducted a series of studies leading to the discovery of neutrons and chain reactions used to obtain atomic energy. Curie was a great patriot and a staunch communist fighter. When Hitler invaded France, he managed to secretly transport two hundred liters of heavy water used for atomic energy research out of France, thus delaying the atomic energy research work of Hitler's Germany. During the German occupation of France in World War II, Joliot-Curie remained in Paris, where he participated in the resistance movement in various ways and joined the Communist Party.

In 1946, Joliot-Curie was appointed High Commissioner of the French Atomic Energy Commission. He advocated that France's atomic energy policy must be a thorough and peaceful policy, and firmly opposed the use of scientific achievements to achieve the goals of war. For this reason, the French government removed him from this position in April 1950.

However, Curie did not stop his peace struggle activities. He actively served as Chairman of the World Peace Council and tirelessly engaged in the struggle to defend world peace. In 1951, he was awarded the International Lenin Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations."

　　卓越的科学家、和平战士
　　约里奥——居里逝世
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社14日讯：卓越的法国物理学家和社会活动家、“加强国际和平”国际列宁奖金获得者、世界和平理事会主席、法国共产党中央委员会委员、“法苏”协会名誉主席弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里教授在重病之后14日在巴黎逝世，享年五十八岁。
    据报道，约里奥—居里在本月11日被送进巴黎一家医院之后，在那里动了外科手术。13日下午病况一度恶化。当天晚上虽略有好转，但是到14日傍晚终于与世长辞。
    约里奥—居里病中，曾经收到法国社会人士和劳动人民代表的大批慰问信和电报。
    约里奥—居里
    约里奥—居里是杰出的法国物理学家，原子核物理学方面最卓越的科学家之一，也是保卫世界和平的坚强战士。他生于1900年。
    约里奥—居里曾和他的夫人伊莲·居里共同发现了人工放射性现象，并进行了引向发现中子和用来获取原子能的链锁反应的一系列研究工作。居里是伟大的爱国者，也是一位坚强的共产主义战士。在希特勒进占法国时，他曾设法将研究原子能用的重水二百公升从法国秘密运出，因此就延迟了希特勒德国的原子能研究工作。第二次世界大战中法国沦陷时期，约里奥—居里留在巴黎，他用各种不同的方式参加抵抗运动，并加入了共产党。
    1946年，约里奥—居里被任命为法国原子能高级专员。他主张法国原子能的政策必须是彻底的和平的政策，坚决反对利用科学上的成就去达到战争的目的。正因为如此，法国政府在1950年4月解除了他的这一职务。
    但是，居里并不因此停止他的和平斗争活动。他积极地担任了世界和平理事会主席的职务，不倦地进行保卫世界和平的斗争。1951年，他荣获了“加强国际和平”国际列宁奖金。
