Heilongjiang Grasps Four Key Experiences:
Leaders Determined; Trusting and Relying on the Masses; On-Site Experience Exchange; Strengthening Planned Division of Labor and Collaboration

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 9th. In the recent twenty-odd days, forty-eight cities and counties in Heilongjiang Province, including Zhaoyuan, Suihua, Shangzhi, Luobei, and Jiamusi—accounting for more than two-thirds of the province's cities and counties—have successfully trial-produced ball bearings and begun mass production. The remaining cities and counties are also vigorously mobilizing the masses to manufacture ball bearings.

Based on the experiences of various places that have already manufactured ball bearings, it is believed that as long as the following four points are grasped, the mystification of ball bearings can be broken. First, leaders must be determined; second, trust and rely on the masses; third, conduct on-site visits and exchange experiences; and fourth, strengthen planned division of labor and collaboration.

When Boli County started working on ball bearings, some leading comrades worried that they would not succeed, but once the masses were mobilized, they successfully trial-produced them in just one afternoon. A Tie-Mu (Iron and Wood) cooperative in Zhao County with simple equipment, under the personal leadership of the county party secretary, worked hard day and night and successfully produced fifty sets of bearings. After breaking the mystical viewpoint, the county proposed that within three days it would universally blossom throughout the county, with every township having a ball bearing factory and every township producing ball bearings. After Zhaodong, Bei'an, Anda, and other counties successfully trial-produced ball bearings, they immediately convened meetings of cadres and the masses, visiting and learning simultaneously. On the basis of addressing the "vague" (criticizing mysterious and conservative ideas), they combined the abstract and the concrete, and quickly formed a mass movement. To solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials for manufacturing ball bearings, some regions have launched a widespread movement to collect scrap iron and steel from cities to villages. The approximately six hundred tons of steel lacking in Hailun County can be entirely resolved through the large-scale collection of scrap iron and steel.

After installing ball bearings on transportation tools, efficiency has been greatly improved. In Fujin County, the efficiency of horse-drawn carts in Fujin Town more than doubled after installing ball bearings. In the past, four or five horses pulled a cart carrying 3,000 jin (1.5 tonnes) and could only travel eight li (4 km) per hour. Now, two horses pull 3,000 jin (1.5 tonnes) and can travel twelve li (6 km) per hour. In Shuangcheng County, the efficiency of flower-wheel carts doubled after being equipped with ball bearings. In many areas, after installing ball bearings on carts, double-wheeled double-share plows, stone rollers, and other transportation tools, efficiency has increased by one to several times. After seeing such great benefits with their own eyes, the masses in many areas have a very high level of enthusiasm, which has greatly promoted the manufacture and installation of ball bearings.

    黑龙江抓住四点经验
    领导决心大；相信群众依靠群众；现场交流经验；加强计划分工协作
    新华社哈尔滨9日电　在最近二十多天的时间内，黑龙江省已经有肇源、绥化、尚志、萝北、佳木斯等四十八个市县，即占全省三分之二以上的市、县试制成功滚珠轴承，并开始转入大量生产。其余的市县也在大力发动群众制造滚珠轴承。
    根据各地已经制成滚珠轴承的经验，认为只要抓住以下四点，就能打破对滚珠轴承的神秘化观念。一是领导决心大，二是相信群众依靠群众，三是现场参观交流经验，四是加强计划分工协作。
    勃利县开始搞滚珠轴承时，有些领导同志耽心搞不成，但是一经发动群众，一个下午就试制成功了。肇州县一个设备简单的铁木业合作社，在县委书记亲自领导下，苦干一昼夜就制成功五十套轴承。神秘观点打破后，这个县提出三天在全县普遍开花，做到乡乡有滚珠工厂，乡乡出产滚珠轴承。肇东、北安、安达等县试制成功滚珠轴承后，立即召开了干部和群众大会，边参观，边学习，在务虚（批评神秘保守思想）的基础上，虚实并举，很快就形成了一个群众性运动。为了解决制造滚珠轴承原材料不足的困难，有些地区从城市到乡村普遍掀起搜集废钢铁运动。海伦县缺少的六百吨左右的钢铁，通过大量搜集废钢铁的办法可全部解决。
    运转工具安装滚珠轴承以后，效率大大提高。富锦县富锦镇马拉大车安上滚珠轴承后，效率提高一倍多。过去四、五匹马拉一辆大车载重三千斤，一小时只能走八里路，现在两匹马拉三千斤，一小时就可以走十二里路。双城县把花轮车装上滚珠轴承后，效率提高了两倍。许多地区将大车、双轮双铧犁、石头滚子等运输工具安上滚珠轴承后，效率都提高一倍到几倍。很多地区群众亲眼看到了这样大的好处后，干劲非常高，都大大促进了制造滚珠轴承和安装滚珠轴承的工作。
