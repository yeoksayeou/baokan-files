　　The sound of car horns drifted in through the window.
      “Once our tools are made, our production will achieve a great leap forward,” Father said, patting his forehead with a hand covered in grease.
      “We will succeed,” I said, glancing at Father’s anxious but hopeful face.
    Mother, carrying a porcelain basin, walked out from the inner room, her robust and tall figure appearing light today. Looking at me, then at Father, she said happily and proudly, “Look, you’re innovating and revolutionizing, we also want to invent something! Come on, try my pearl soup, even big restaurants don’t sell it!”
    Father stayed close to the window without moving. His naturally large eyes were narrowed into slits, his hands gesturing constantly, his mouth opening and closing…
    This unenthusiastic attitude made Mother, who had a strong sense of pride, angry. She pouted, her face slightly red, and said in a reproachful tone:
  “Is your thinking still not liberated? Looking down on us cooks!” I hurried over, took the porcelain basin from Mother’s hands and said: “Mom! It smells really good.” I took a sip and said with a smile, “Mom, it really smells good, like – like your pearl soup.” Mother couldn’t help but laugh.
    Our laughter didn't affect Father, he still leaned against the window. These past few days, the factory has been engaged in a technical revolution, whose mind isn't focused on improving tools? To be honest, Father, me, and many, many workers have not been thinking about eating. Mother always urged Father and me. A few times Father slammed the table and shouted: "Hey, why are you so anxious about eating? Is it like you won't live if you don't eat this meal!" But when a problem has an answer, his tall body would jump suddenly, the wrinkles on his face would immediately smooth out, and his joyful and lively energy would be like a young man. My wife told me: "Dad is so interesting, he secretly begged Mom behind our backs: 'We're an old couple, don't be angry with me. You know my fiery temper. Think about it, I'm over fifty years old, if I don't hurry up and put in some effort, how ashamed will I be when we get to communist society?'"
    I know that sometimes Mother deliberately argues with Father in front of us to show her dignity, but she is very considerate of Father and also cares about the factory's production.
    Think! Think! Father stomped his feet softly but chaotically. Mother opened her big eyes, habitually looking at me, looking at Father, as if wanting to share our anxiety, and also as if hoping: "Think it through quickly! Think it through quickly!"
    Mother didn't know that for many years our valve repair work has been the most troublesome work. One by one we grind and scrape. Every major repair requires two or three hundred valves, which takes a lot of man-hours! Can we mechanize it? Yes! All the members of our valve group, under the leadership of my father, the group leader, fought hard for fifty-six hours and used waste materials to make a mechanically driven tool that grinds eight valves simultaneously. The Party Branch Secretary excitedly patted the young man’s shoulder and said: “Use your brains, think hard, building socialism shouldn't be walking, we should be running, we should be riding in cars.” But today several tests have failed—the grinding is skewed.
      “Dad, how about adding a compression spring to the rotating shaft?” I suddenly thought of this method from other machinery.
      “Right! Right!” Father slapped the table, almost shouting: “Let’s go, let’s test it.” Father suddenly put on his clothes, and I jumped out of bed with a thud. "Grandpa," my seven-year-old daughter suddenly ran in, "look at the little car I invented." She shook a pair of pigtails, her rosy, lovely round face smiling like a blooming peony. Who would have thought that she would have tied a large gear from my broken clock to a wooden toy car.
    Father excitedly picked her up, held her up high: "Good! My good granddaughter, the elderly are making revolution, the youth are making revolution, and the children must also make revolution. Hey! Building socialism means not just riding in cars, but riding in airplanes!" He said, heavily and loudly kissing his beloved granddaughter on the face, kissing her, kissing her.

　　全家闹技术革命（小小说）
　　包头电厂工人　李俊亭
    从窗口传进几声汽车的喇叭声。
      “等我们的工具做好，我们的生产就能大跃进了。”父亲用一只沾满油泥的手，拍了拍脑门说。
      “我们会成功的。”我一边说一边望了望父亲那张焦急但又充满希望的脸。
    母亲托着一个磁盆，从里屋走出来，她那粗壮高大的身材，今天却显得轻盈。望望我，瞅瞅父亲，快活而又得意地说：“瞧，你们创造呀，革命呀，我们也要发明发明啦，来，尝尝我这珍珠汤，大饭馆也没有卖的！”
    父亲紧靠窗户动都没动，他那两只生来的大眼睛，眯成了一条线，手在不停地比画，嘴一张一张。……
    这个不热情的态度，使自尊心很强的母亲生了气，她噘了噘嘴，脸有些红，带些斥责的声调说：
  “思想还没有解放吗？瞧不起我们做饭的！”我赶忙跑过去从母亲手里接过磁盆来：“妈！真香。”我喝了一口笑着又说：“妈，是真香，就像是——就像你的珍珠汤。”母亲忍不住笑了。
    我们的笑声，并没有影响了父亲，他仍靠在窗口。这几天，厂里闹技术革命，谁的脑子不用在改进工具上呢？说实话，父亲、我、好多好多工人，都不把吃饭放在心上了。母亲总是催催父亲，催催我。有几次父亲一拍桌子，大喊起来：“嗬，干么对吃饭那么着急，吃了这顿不活啦！”不过当一个问题思考的有答案的时候，他那高壮的身体会猛跳一下，脸上的皱纹顿时舒展，快乐活泼的劲头可像个小伙子呢。我爱人跟我说：“爸爸可有意思，背着咱们却央告母亲哩：‘老夫老妻的别生我的气，我这个火性子你还不知道，你想想五十多岁啦，要不赶快卖点劲，将来到了共产主义社会该多惭愧’”。
    我知道，母亲有时当着我们的面，为了显示自己的尊严，故意和父亲争几句，但她十分体贴父亲，也很关心厂里的生产呢。
    想啊！想啊！父亲轻声但又杂乱地跺着脚，母亲睁着大眼睛，习惯地望望我，望望父亲，像在想分担我们的焦急，又像在盼望：“快想好吧！快想好吧！”
    母亲那里知道，多少年来我们干的检修截门的工作就是最麻烦的工作，一个一个地磨呀，刮呀，每次大修二三百个截门，要花去多少工时啊！能不能将他改成机械化呢？能！我们全体截门组组员，在组长我父亲的领导下，苦战了五十六小时，用废料制成一架机械传动同时又研磨八个截门的工具。党支书兴奋地拍着青年人的肩膀说：“动脑子想，好好想，建设社会主义不能走，应该跑，应该坐汽车。”但今天几次试验，都失败了——研磨的偏斜。
      “爸爸，我们在转动轴上加个压缩弹簧怎么样？”我突然从其他机械上想出这么个办法来。
      “对！对！”父亲拍了下桌子，几乎是大声喊：“走，试验去。”父亲猛然披上衣服，我咚地一声跳下炕来。“爷爷，”这时候我七岁的小女孩突然跑进来，“看看我发明的小汽车。”她摇晃着一对小辫子，红润可爱的小圆脸笑的像一朵盛开的牡丹花。谁能想到她把我家坏钟上的一个大齿轮绑到木制的小车上去了。
    父亲兴奋地将她抱起来，抱的高高的：“好啊！我的好孙女，老年人革命，青年人革命，小孩子也要革命。嗬！建设社会主义不坐汽车，要坐飞机啊！”他说着在他心爱的小孙女脸上，重重地，响响地，亲着，亲着。
