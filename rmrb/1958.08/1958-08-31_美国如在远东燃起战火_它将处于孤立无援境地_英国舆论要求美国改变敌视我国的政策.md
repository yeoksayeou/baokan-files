Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch from London: Many British newspapers and some political figures have expressed unease about the tensions created by the United States in the Taiwan area.

Labor MP Brockway said on the 29th that Jinmen and Matsu Islands are part of China, just as the Isle of Wight is part of Britain. He demanded that the British government immediately state that Britain will not be involved in any possible conflict.

The Liberal Party's "Manchester Guardian" said on the 29th, "In the world, probably no other government except that of Syngman Rhee would join the United States in fighting for the Jinmen Islands. The Chinese Communists' sovereignty over the coastal islands is indisputable."

The Liberal Party's "Star Evening News" said on the 29th that Britain should tell the Americans: "It is not worth sacrificing the life of a Briton or an American" to engage in adventurous activities in the Taiwan area. The newspaper said that Matsu and Jinmen are as close to China as the Isle of Wight is to Southampton, "Any normal government's right to knock down such a hornet's nest on its own doorstep would be supported by the majority of people. Can Red China be denied this right?"

Mark, the Washington correspondent for the conservative "Daily Express," wrote on the 30th that the possibility of conflict in the Taiwan area is causing "serious unease" in Western diplomatic circles. The reporter warned that if the United States takes adventurous actions, it will be isolated in world opinion and may split with its allies. He said, "Federal diplomats believe that the danger of the United States falling into isolation will be far more serious than the isolation Britain encountered in Suez."

The "Daily Mirror" published a cartoon by Vicky on the 29th, satirizing the United States' continued support for the political zombie that is Chiang Kai-shek. The cartoon depicts Chiang Kai-shek sitting on three bayonet-fitted rifles stuck into the soil of Taiwan, with the words "Made in the USA" on the rifles. His face is turned towards the fierce artillery fire coming from China. Dulles stands beside Chiang Kai-shek, pointing at him and saying: "Can't you see? He is defending his independence against a non-existent country."

The "New Statesman and Nation" magazine, published on August 30th, said that the United States' policy towards China is "stupid." Jinmen and Matsu Islands are closer to mainland China than the Isle of Wight is to England, and almost the entire world (including Britain) recognizes that they are actually part of mainland China. The magazine said, "To close one's eyes to the existence of one of the largest, toughest, most fertile, and most productive countries on earth," "the consequences of which are unimaginably dangerous." If Dulles continues to try to erase this heartland of the world, which has nearly a quarter of the world's population, from the world map, then he will be "hoist with his own petard."

The "News Chronicle" said on the 26th that if Americans fight to "defend" Jinmen and Matsu Islands, they will find themselves isolated among all their allies.

The "Scotsman" wrote on the 26th that if the United States insists on its rigid attitude towards China, the differences between the United States' and Britain's China policies will become clearer.

　　美国如在远东燃起战火  它将处于孤立无援境地
    英国舆论要求美国改变敌视我国的政策
    新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：英国许多报纸和一些政界人士对美国在台湾地区制造紧张局势表示不安。
    工党议员布罗克威29日说，金门和马祖岛是中国的一部分，正如威地岛是英国一部分一样。他要求英国政府立即表明，英国不会卷入可能发生的冲突中去。
    自由党的“曼彻斯特卫报”29日说，“在世界上，除了李承晚以外，大概没有其他政府会为了金门各岛而同美国并肩作战。中国共产党人对于沿海岛屿的主权是不容争辩的”。
    自由党“明星晚报”29日说，英国应当告诉美国人：“不值得牺牲一个英国人或者一个美国人的生命”在台湾地区进行冒险活动。这家报纸说，马祖和金门之靠近中国犹如威地岛之靠近南安普敦，“任何正常的政府捣掉它自己门阶上的像这样的蜂窝的权利都会得到大多数人的支持。难道能够不让红色中国得到这种权利吗？”
    保守的“每日快报”驻华盛顿记者马克30日写道，在台湾地区发生冲突的可能性使西方外交界感到“严重不安”。记者警告说，如果美国采取冒险行动，它在世界舆论中将陷于孤立，而且可能与它的盟国分裂。他说，“联邦的外交人士认为，美国所冒的陷于孤立的危险，将远比英国在苏伊士所碰到的孤立更为严重”。
    “每日镜报”29日刊登了维基的一幅漫画，讽刺美国目前仍在支持蒋介石这个政治僵尸。这幅漫画的内容是：蒋介石坐在架在台湾土地上的三支装有刺刀的步枪上面，步枪都有“美国造”的字样，他的脸对着中国朝他打来的猛烈炮火。杜勒斯站在蒋介石的旁边，用手指着蒋介石说：“难道你看不到吗？是他在保卫他的独立，抵抗一个并不存在的国家。”
    8月30日出版的“新政治家与民族”杂志说，美国对中国的政策是“愚昧”的。金门和马祖岛离中国大陆比威地岛离英格兰还要近，并且差不多全世界（包括英国）都承认它们实际上是中国大陆的一部分。杂志说，“要闭上眼睛不看地球上一个最大的、最硬的、最肥沃的、生产潜力最大的国家的存在”，“其后果的危险是不堪设想的”。如果杜勒斯继续想从世界地图上抹掉拥有将近世界人口四分之一的这个世界心脏部分，那他将“自作自受”。
    “新闻纪事报”26日说，如果美国人为“防卫”金门和马祖岛而战斗，那么他们将发现他们会在他们的所有盟国当中孤立起来。
    “苏格兰人报”26日写道，如果美国坚持它的僵硬的对华态度，美国和英国对华政策之间的分歧将更加明朗化。
