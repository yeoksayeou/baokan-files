(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th) The fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament began its plenary session on the 17th amidst enthusiastic applause celebrating the anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Indonesia.

Ito Masao, a representative of the Yokohama Port Workers' Union, who is currently engaged in a struggle at Yokohama Port to prevent the unloading of "Oerlikon 56" missiles, arrived at the venue and was welcomed by the participants with applause. Ito reported on the situation of the dockworkers' struggle to refuse unloading missiles and appealed to the conference to support their struggle. The conference immediately decided to write a letter in the name of the conference to the Yokohama dockworkers, supporting and encouraging their just struggle.

Valentin Sorokin, representative of the World Peace Council, Barrak from Iraq, Mrs. Flora Gould from New Zealand, Godofredo Garcia Rendon from Peru, Zygmunt Skibniewski from Poland, Professor Lubsangvandan from Mongolia, Kurt Vogel from the International Union of Students, and Li Ji-baek, representative of Korean residents in Japan, spoke at the meeting successively.

The plenary session continued on the evening of the 17th. The meeting read out the congratulatory telegram from Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and then representatives of various countries and international organizations delivered speeches in succession.

Three group meetings and a jurists' meeting were held during the day of the 17th at the World Conference.

The first group meeting was divided into three committees to discuss the issue of concluding an agreement on the immediate cessation of nuclear testing, the elimination of nuclear armament and its threat, and the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and general disarmament.

All committees agreed that the current urgent issue is to immediately stop nuclear testing through actions involving a broader range of people in the world; to urge countries possessing nuclear weapons to conclude an agreement banning nuclear testing; to stop nuclear armament and withdraw military bases and troops from foreign countries.

The committees also reached a consensus on the necessity of the following: (1) holding a summit meeting between East and West; (2) establishing nuclear-free zones in Europe and Asia; (3) restoring normal relations between Japan and China and restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations; (4) returning Okinawa to Japan.

The second group meeting discussed the issue of promoting the world peace movement and world cooperation. The Japanese representative made three suggestions at the meeting: (1) dispatching international parade and speaking groups; (2) holding an "International Action Month" to promote the conclusion of an agreement banning nuclear testing; (3) opposing the Northeast Asian military bloc. These suggestions were supported by representatives of various countries.

The third group meeting discussed the new moral and obligations of mankind in the atomic age. The Jurists' Meeting continued its discussion today on the legal aspects of banning atomic and hydrogen bombs and disarmament. The meeting adopted a statement and an appeal to scientists around the world and decided to submit the statement and appeal to the plenary session.

At the plenary session held on the 18th, representatives of Asian and African countries unanimously condemned colonialism as the enemy of peace and demanded that the US-British invading forces immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

Ms. Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong, representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said that the victory of the Vietnamese people in the Dien Bien Phu battle prevented the aggression of US imperialism. She put forward the following demands: the United States and Britain should immediately withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East; France should stop the war of aggression against Algeria; and nuclear testing should be stopped immediately.

The representative of the United Arab Republic strongly demanded in his speech that the US and British imperialists immediately withdraw their troops from West Asia and demanded that France stop its criminal plan to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert.

Pakistani representative Hafiz Muhammad Habibullah condemned the armed intervention of the US and Britain in the Middle East in his speech. At the same time, he said that in order to maintain peace, the government of any country must not accept foreign nuclear weapons.

Thai representative Nai Thep Chutinuchee pointed out in his speech that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool for colonialists to suppress the Asian national independence movement. He also condemned the colonialists for implementing a war policy aimed at profiting the arms industry.

Cameroonian representative Ernest Kandi, while condemning colonialism, specifically quoted what Guo Moruo said at the Stockholm Peace Conference: "As long as colonialism exists, there will be no lasting peace in the world."

Japanese representative Do Monkoichi made a report at the meeting. He said that according to this morning's news reports, the British Ministry of Defense announced that it would conduct a nuclear test on Christmas Island soon. He suggested that the conference ask the British government to stop nuclear testing and at the same time ask the British government and other countries possessing nuclear weapons to conclude an agreement to stop nuclear testing.

Jean Chand from the Women's International Democratic Federation, Toge Hidetomi from the World Federation of Scientific Workers, Kienetzki from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and Willmann from the German Democratic Republic spoke at the meeting successively and read out congratulatory letters from various international organizations to the conference.

The Vietnamese delegation, the Burmese delegation and the Yugoslavian delegation also presented flags and gifts to the conference and the Japanese delegation at the meeting. (Attached picture)
