Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st. Today's "Pravda" editorial uses extensive materials to reveal that American and British aggressors are preparing to expand their aggression against Arab countries. The editorial believes that the leaders of these two countries, in order to divert world public opinion from their armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, dare not accept and dare not openly reject the Soviet government's proposal to hold a summit meeting.

The editorial, entitled "Stop the Aggression," points out that American and British aggressors are stepping up the concentration of troops, preparing to launch a large-scale military offensive against Arab Eastern countries. The editorial says that American and British aggressors have shared the roles of armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and are colluding to actively plan to expand this intervention. In military staff departments and at diplomatic negotiating tables, participating countries in aggressive treaties and aggressive blocs are fanatically drafting plans to eliminate the Republic of Iraq. The imperialists' conspiracies against Arab countries are becoming more and more blatant and widespread.

The editorial points out that the "Baghdad Pact" Council meeting, which closed in London, clarified plans to expand aggression against Arab Eastern countries. The imperialists are attempting to piece together an aggressive Near East bloc centered on Turkey, called the "Northern Tier," on the basis of the fragmented Baghdad Pact. In the past, Dulles had been active for several years in establishing this aggressive bloc aimed at the Soviet Union and Arab countries, and the British diplomatic community had opposed it for fear that it would threaten its Middle East policy. However, now the aggressors are in complete agreement in opposing the people of Arab countries.

American businessmen have now begun to calculate how much profit they can make by expanding aggression in the Near East.

The editorial says that in this situation, Khrushchev's letter of July 28 to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the immediate holding of a summit meeting has great political significance.

The editorial says that the national leaders of the United States and Britain, in order to divert world public opinion from their armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, dare not accept and dare not reject the Soviet proposal to convene a high-level meeting. They dare not openly oppose the summit meeting that is warmly supported by world public opinion, so they are trying to drown the Soviet proposal in endless exchanges of letters and in fruitless debates over the agenda of the Security Council.

The US and British governments have twice rejected the dates proposed by the Soviet government for a five-nation summit meeting, but have never proposed their own dates. When the Soviet government accepted the form of meeting proposed by Britain and the United States, the leaders of these two countries immediately abandoned the agreement that had been reached. They are afraid of being held responsible for their aggression against the Arab East in front of the people of the world.

The editorial says that the aggressors always pretend as if nothing special has happened in the Near East, and therefore there is no need to rush to discuss the Near East issue. Their propagandists are trying to describe the US military intervention in Lebanon and the British military intervention in Jordan as some kind of "friendly visit." The aggressors are trying to paralyze the vigilance of the people in this way, while secretly preparing to expand the intervention. However, the people cannot be deceived, especially the people who are suffering from military occupation.

The editorial says that the Soviet government's demand to take measures to immediately stop the aggression and to immediately withdraw the intervention troops from Lebanon and Jordan has received widespread support from international public opinion. All countries of the socialist camp, including China with its 600 million people, as well as the people of India and other Asian countries, the Near East, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, have unanimously demanded: stop the aggression! Immediately withdraw the intervention troops from Arab Eastern countries!

### 苏联“真理报”社论指出  美英所以拖延举行首脑会议  旨在转移世界视线扩大侵略

    苏联“真理报”社论指出
    美英所以拖延举行首脑会议  旨在转移世界视线扩大侵略
    新华社莫斯科31日电　“真理报”今天的社论以大量材料揭露，美、英侵略者正在准备扩大对阿拉伯国家的侵略。社论认为，这两个国家的领导人为了转移世界舆论对他们武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的注意，既不敢接受又不敢公然拒绝苏联政府关于举行政府首脑会议的建议。
    这篇题为“制止侵略”的社论指出，美英侵略者正在加紧集结军队，准备向阿拉伯东方国家进行大规模的军事进攻。社论说，美英侵略者分担了武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的角色，并且狼狈为奸积极谋划扩大这种干涉。在军事参谋部里，在外交谈判桌旁，侵略条约和侵略集团的参加国在狂热地拟定消灭伊拉克共和国的计划。帝国主义者反对阿拉伯各国的阴谋越来越露骨，越来越广泛了。
    社论指出，目前在伦敦闭幕的“巴格达条约”理事会会议明确了扩大侵略阿拉伯东方各国的计划。帝国主义者企图在支离破碎的巴格达条约基础上再拼凑一个以土耳其为中心的、名之曰“北层”的侵略性的近东集团。过去，杜勒斯为建立这一个矛头指向苏联和阿拉伯国家的侵略集团曾活动过好几年，英国外交界怕这威胁自己中东政策而曾加以反对，然而现在，侵略者反对阿拉伯各国人民的步调完全一致了。
    美国的生意人现在已经开始盘算他们能借扩大侵略中近东获取多少利润。
    社论说，在这种局面下，赫鲁晓夫7月28日写给美、英、法政府首脑的关于立即举行政府首脑会议的信件，就具有重大的政治意义。
    社论说，美英两国的国家领导人为了转移世界舆论对他们武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的注意，既不敢接受也不敢拒绝苏联关于召开高级会议的建议。他们不敢明目张胆地反对召开为世界舆论热烈支持的首脑会议，于是企图使苏联的建议淹没在无休止的信件往返中，淹没在关于安理会议程的不会有结果的争论中。
    美国和英国政府两次拒绝了苏联政府所建议的五国政府首脑会议的日期，但是一次也没有提出过自己的日期。当苏联政府接受了英国和美国所提出的举行会议的形式后，这两个国家的领导人又立即背弃了已经达成的协议。他们害怕在全世界人民的面前对他们侵略阿拉伯东方的行动负责。
    社论说，侵略者总是装出一副样子，仿佛中近东并没有发生什么特别的事情，因此毫没有必要急于讨论近东问题。他们的宣传家力图把美国军队干涉黎巴嫩和英国军队干涉约旦说成是某种“友好访问”。侵略者企图用这种方法麻痹人民的警惕性，同时却偷偷地准备扩大干涉。然而，人民是欺骗不了的，遭受军事占领的人民尤其是欺骗不了的。
    社论说，苏联政府关于采取措施立刻制止侵略并要干涉军立刻撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的要求受到国际舆论广泛的支持。所有社会主义阵营的国家、其中包括六亿人口的中国，还有印度和亚洲其他国家的人民、中近东、非洲、欧洲和美洲的人民都一致提出要求：制止侵略！干涉军立刻撤出阿拉伯东方国家！
