Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 24th: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Ironmaking Department overfulfilled its Leap Forward plan by 10% from January to July. During this period, it repeatedly set national records for the utilization rate of ironmaking furnaces.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Ironmaking Department's good production performance is mainly due to the creativity and enthusiasm of the vast number of workers. They launched a technical innovation movement centered on production. The more than 500 technical innovations that have been implemented have played a significant role in completing production and improving product quality. For example, after the department adopted methods to increase smelting intensity and increase the number of charging batches, it greatly shortened the smelting cycle, increased production, and reduced coke consumption.

In order to better complete this year's production tasks, the Ironmaking Department decided to thoroughly overcome the phenomenon of separation between politics and professional work. Basic-level cadres such as shift leaders and team leaders should not only manage production but also do political and ideological work. At the same time, competitions are launched between groups, sections, and individuals, with inspections every half month and evaluations every month, comparing political thought, ideological liberation, technical innovation, production quality first, and "two participations and one reform" (two participations: cadre participation in labor, worker participation in management; one reform: reform of irrational and outdated rules), using politics to drive professional work, and creating a new high tide of production.

　　太原钢铁厂炼铁部
    利用系数连创全国纪录
    一至七月份跃进计划完成110％
    新华社太原24日电　太原钢铁厂炼铁部1月到7月份的跃进计划超额10％完成，在这期间并几次创造炼铁炉利用系数的全国最高纪录。
    太原钢铁厂炼铁部生产任务完成得好，主要是因为广大工人发挥了创造性和积极性，围绕着生产开展了技术革新运动，已实现的五百多项技术革新，对完成生产和提高产品质量起了很大作用。例如，这个部采取提高冶炼强度，增加下料批数的办法后，大大缩短冶炼周期，提高了产量，降低了焦炭消耗量。
    为了更好地完成今年的生产任务，炼铁部决定彻底克服政治与业务脱节的现象，工段长、组长等基层干部不仅要管生产，而且要做政治思想工作。同时各组、各段、个人之间展开竞赛，半月一检查，一月一评比，比政治思想、比思想解放、技术革新，比生产质量第一、比“两参一改”，以政治带动业务，掀起一个新的生产高潮。
