Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 3rd: More than forty Muslims in Hong Kong today published a protest letter condemning US and British imperialist armed aggression against the Middle East, and firmly demanding that the American and British troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan.

The protest letter pointed out that this “unreasonable act of aggression by US-British imperialism is not only hostile to the Arab people, but more seriously endangers world peace.” The protest letter stated that the people of many countries in the Middle East are followers of Islam, “and like us, love peace and oppose war. Their suffering is our suffering, and now that they are being invaded, we feel the same way. Therefore, we firmly oppose the US-British imperialist aggression against the Middle East! US-British imperialism must immediately get out of the Middle East!”

The chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Islamic Association, Abdul Rashid Lau, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today that the US-British imperialist acts of aggression against the Middle East region violate the desire of peace-loving people all over the world. He demanded that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, otherwise, the United States and Britain will be responsible for all the consequences. The vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Islamic Association, Ibrahim Bai, criticized the United States' delay in convening a summit conference. He said: Under the righteous condemnation of the people all over the world, the US-British imperialist acts of aggression are bound to fail, and final victory will surely belong to the Arab people and the peace-loving people all over the world.
