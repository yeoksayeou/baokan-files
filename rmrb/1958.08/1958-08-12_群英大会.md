    "Heroes' Convention"
    The "One Day of the Great Leap Forward" essay contest initiated by the Writers Publishing House is an attempt to organize large-scale mass creation. Now, the initially received submissions have been compiled and selected for publication in volumes. The first volume, "Heroes' Convention," will be published on the 15th of this month. The book contains seventeen works by workers, peasants, soldiers, and cadres from all over the country. From various work positions, they reflect the face of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland from many aspects, and tell the vast number of readers the most exciting and inspiring stories and scenes that happen every day on the motherland's various production fronts and various work positions. These works are not only rich and novel in content and reflect a wide range of life, but they are also generally able to be clear, concise, lively, and have clear and vivid characters, showing the infinite future of mass creation.
