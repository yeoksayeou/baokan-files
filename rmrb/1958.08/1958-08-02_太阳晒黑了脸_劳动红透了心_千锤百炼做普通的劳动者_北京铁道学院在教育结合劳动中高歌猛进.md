Faces tanned by the sun, hearts reddened by labor
Forge ahead to be ordinary workers
Beijing Railway Institute advances triumphantly in integrating education with labor
(Reported by our correspondent Bai Sheng) Under the glorious guidance of the general line for socialist construction, more than two thousand teachers, students, and staff members of the Beijing Railway Institute, under the slogans of learning from the "Yingju Agricultural Cooperative" and the "Jiushan Red and Expert University," and changing their outlook, have broken down superstitions, liberated their minds, and, with a revolutionary spirit, started from scratch, vigorously running factories and farms. They have achieved remarkable results in implementing the policy of education serving politics and integrating education with labor, setting a red flag example for institutions of higher learning.

Four Major Characteristics

Recently, Comrade Kang Sheng, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, visited Beijing Railway Institute and expressed great satisfaction with the work of the institute.

The integration of education and labor at this school has four significant characteristics: First, there is a great deal of enthusiasm from top to bottom, especially among the students. Second, some students go to railway sites to work, achieving three goals at once: they train the students, teaching is combined with practice, and in turn, teaching can be improved and teaching materials can be written. Third, they start from scratch, running factories from small to large, using indigenous methods to accumulate experience and funds. Fourth, the farm is doing well, with corn yields of 800 jin per mu, and high-yield fields yielding over 1,000 jin per mu.

During his visit, Comrade Kang Sheng also personally wrote an inscription for the students: "Be tempered and forged, to become an ordinary worker."

Right Direction, Sufficient Enthusiasm

The engineering and technical foundation of Beijing Railway Institute was very weak. Before the rectification campaign, many people had a strong sense of inferiority, and some students were even unwilling to wear the Beijing Railway Institute badge when they left the school. However, after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, studying the general line for socialist construction, listening to the report of the head of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative, and learning from the experience of Jiushan Red and Expert University, people's minds were liberated. They reached a conclusion completely opposite to the past, saying: "Poor people have high aspirations," "Poverty leads to change," learning from Yingju and Jiushan, determined to fight hard for five years to completely change the face of the institute. The Party committee promptly concentrated the will of the masses of the whole institute, and proposed the grand goal of striving to rebuild the institute into a communist railway institute in five years through hard work. It was proposed to cultivate talent that is red in politics and ideology, and professionally capable of surveying, designing, constructing, manufacturing, operating, and commanding the entire set of railway construction. Starting from June 20th, the masses of the whole institute, especially the students, under the leadership of the Party committee, actively took action, and the trend of vigorously running factories swept the whole institute.

Starting from Scratch to Run Factories

The students of Beijing Railway Institute, who transformed a dilapidated warehouse into a loudspeaker factory in two days of hard work, posted a striking couplet in their humble factory: "Starting from scratch to run factories, combining indigenous and foreign methods to surpass Britain and America." The students who built the loudspeaker factory also described their factory-building scene heroically, saying: "Yesterday morning we were porters, in the afternoon we were bricklayers, and today we are electrical workers." An ideal factory was built from scratch in this way.

Beijing Railway Institute also has a factory that is at the forefront of the entire institute in starting from scratch—the reinforced concrete sleeper factory. Everything in this factory was built using old waste materials, and even the nails were all pulled from old wood. Only the factory's fund of 1,400 yuan was spent from the pre-payment for the order they made with the Ministry of Railways. In addition, the newly built brake shoe factory was started with a small iron furnace borrowed from the Iron and Steel Research Institute, plus a few other small pieces of equipment pieced together from various places. The chemical factory and woodworking factory used broken vats because they had no reaction tanks; they used old machines to modify themselves because they had no lathes, planers, or drilling machines. In the process of building the factory, if they did not understand the technology, they sent "students" to other factories to learn. Up to now, more than twenty factories in the whole institute have been established in this way, overcoming various difficulties.

Factories and Classrooms—The Railway Network of the Motherland

While vigorously running factories, Beijing Railway Institute also launched a upsurge of linking up with factories outside the school and going to the vast railway sites outside the school to work. More than 400 students and teachers of the Transportation Department have set off; more than 300 students and teachers of the Economics Department are now working in nine railway administrations for investigation and research. Whether they are teachers and students of the Transportation Department or teachers and students of the Economics Department, they are all preparing to further integrate theory with practice based on the actual experience of the site, so as to innovate teaching content and enrich teaching materials.

Hongguoyuan Farm Welcomes Harvest

The address of Beijing Railway Institute is located in Hongguoyuan, outside Xizhimen. Since November last year, teachers, students, and staff have jointly developed the Hongguoyuan Farm. The total cultivated land of the farm is 74 mu. From turning the soil and accumulating fertilizer in winter to sowing in spring, they have paid the price of hard work. By the end of June, the students of the Economics Department took over the drought-resistant work of all the land. Now the corn on the Hongguoyuan Farm has grown far beyond the heads of people, the cobs are already full of ears, the sweet potato vines are lush, and other crops and pigs and ducks are also growing very well. It is expected that this year's crops will yield more than 800 jin per mu. Facing this piece of prosperous farm, the teachers, students, and staff of the whole institute have endless joy and thoughts in their hearts.

"Although the labor of the farm has tanned our faces, what is more pleasant is that labor has reddened our hearts." This is the feeling from the bottom of the students' hearts. The growth of the Hongguoyuan Farm, which is looking forward to a bumper harvest, has also changed people's ideological outlook.

Now Beijing Railway Institute has put forward the slogan of continuing to forge ahead to become red and expert, preparing to design and manufacture new types of internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives as soon as possible, and manufacture a new set of communication signal equipment. They have decided to move forward in big strides under the leadership of the Party, and cultivate railway construction talents who are both red and expert for the motherland! (Attached picture)

    太阳晒黑了脸　劳动红透了心
    千锤百炼做普通的劳动者
    北京铁道学院在教育结合劳动中高歌猛进
    本报讯　记者柏生报道：北京铁道学院在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全院师生员工二千多人，在学“应举农业社”、学“鸠山红专大学”、改变面貌的口号下，破除迷信，解放了思想，以革命的精神，白手起家，大办工厂、农场，在贯彻教育为政治服务、教育和劳动结合的方针方面取得了显著的成绩，为高等学校树立了一面红旗。
    四大特点
    最近，中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志，到北京铁道学院参观时，对这个学院的工作表示很满意。
    这个学校教育结合劳动，有四个显著特点：第一，上下干劲很大，特别是学生。第二，一部分学生到铁路现场劳动，可以一举三得：既锻炼了学生，教学又结合了实际，反过来可以改进教学，编写教材。第三，白手起家，由小到大大办工厂，用土办法，一面积累经验，一面积累资金。第四，农场搞的好，玉米亩产八百斤，丰产田亩产千斤以上。
    康生同志在参观时，还亲笔给学生们题词写道：“千锤百炼，做一个普通劳动者。”
    方向对  干劲足
    北京铁道学院工程技术基础很薄弱。整风前许多人的自卑感十分严重，有的学生甚至出校时不愿佩戴北京铁道学院的校徽。但是，经过整风运动和反右派斗争，学习了社会主义建设总路线，听了应举农业社社长的报告，学习了鸠山红专大学的经验，人们的思想解放了。他们得出了和过去完全相反的结论，说：“人穷志高”，“穷则思变”，学应举，学鸠山，决心苦战五年，彻底改变学院面貌。党委及时集中了全院群众的意志，提出了苦战五年，争取把学院改建成为一所共产主义的铁道学院的宏伟目标。提出在政治上、思想上培养红透的，在专业上培养又能勘测、又能设计、又能施工、又能制造、又能运用、又能指挥的全套铁道建设人材。从6月20日开始，全院群众首先是学生在党委领导下，积极行动起来了，大办工厂之风吹遍全院。
    白手起家办工厂
    在两天的苦战中，把一个破仓库改建成为扬声器工厂的北京铁道学院的学生们，在他们简陋的工厂里，贴上了一副引人注目的对联：“白手起家办工厂，土洋并举超英美”。建造扬声器工厂的学生们，还豪迈地描写他们的建厂情景说：“我们昨天上午是搬运工，下午是泥水工，今天又做了电气工。”一个理想的工厂就这样白手起家地建成了。
    北京铁道学院还有一个走在全院最前面的白手起家的工厂——钢筋混凝土轨枕厂。这个厂建厂时的一切都是利用旧废料，甚至连钉子也是全部从旧木料上拔下来的。只有建厂的基金一千四百元是从他们和铁道部订货的预拨款中开支的。此外像新建的闸瓦厂，是从钢铁研究院借来的一个小铁炉，加上到处拼凑的其他几件小设备就搞起来了。化工厂、木工厂没有反应罐，就用破缸；没有旋床，没有刨床，没有钻床，就自己动手用破旧的机器改装。在建厂中不懂技术，就派“留学生”到别的工厂去学习。到现在，全院二十多座工厂，就是这样克服了各种困难建立起来了。
    工厂和课堂——祖国的铁路网
    北京铁道学院大办工厂的同时，还掀起了和校外工厂挂钩、到校外广阔的铁路现场去劳动的热潮。运输系的学生和教师已有四百多人，出发了；经济系的学生和教师也有三百多人，现在已分别下到九个铁路管理局作调查研究工作。不论是运输系的师生，还是经济系的师生，他们都准备结合现场的实际体会，进一步使理论联系实际，达到革新教学内容，充实教材的目的。
    红果园农场迎丰收
    北京铁道学院的院址座落在西直门外红果园。从去年11月，师生员工共同开辟了红果园农场。全场耕地有七十四亩，从冬天翻土积肥，到春天播种，他们付出了勤劳的代价。到6月下旬，经济系的学生又把全部土地的抗旱工作包了下来。现在红果园农场的玉米已长得远远超过人头，棒子已经满秆累累，白薯枝叶茂密，其他农作物及猪鸭等也生长得十分良好，预计今年的农作物将亩产八百斤以上。红果园农场的丰收在望，全院师生员工面对着这一片丰收的农场，心里有说不尽的喜悦和感想。
    “农场的劳动，虽然太阳晒黑了我们的脸，但更愉快的是劳动红透了我们的心。”这是同学们发自内心的感受。丰收在望的红果园农场的成长，使人们的思想面貌也获得了改变。
    现在北京铁道学院又提出了向红专继续高歌猛进的口号，准备尽快地自己设计制造新型的内燃机车和电气机车，并制造一套新型的通信信号设备。他们决定在党的领导下大步前进，为祖国培养又红又专的铁路建设人才！（附图片）
