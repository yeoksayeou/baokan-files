Indigenous Method for Making Steel Wire Rope

    A vacant lot and two wooden hand-operated machines are enough to produce large quantities of steel wire rope, which is currently scarce in various industrial sectors.

    At the end of July, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened an on-site promotion meeting for steel wire rope production at the Tianjin Steel Wire Stranding Factory, organizing representatives from various regions to visit the factory's indigenous methods of manufacturing steel wire rope. The factory has more than 140 employees, and by adopting indigenous methods, this year's output can leap from the original plan of more than 1,500 tons to 2,200 tons, capable of producing steel wire ropes with diameters ranging from 3 to 38 millimeters and lengths up to 500 meters. It can produce not only general-structure steel wire ropes but also cables, supplying various departments such as aviation, water conservancy, electric power, and coal.

    Representatives from various regions summarized the experience of the Tianjin Steel Wire Stranding Factory's indigenous methods, believing that to set up a steel wire rope factory with an annual output of 100 tons, all that is needed is a flat piece of land, two wooden hand-operated machines, and two pairs of cast iron gears. New workers can master production in half a month. Such a factory can be built in a week, with an investment of only 250 yuan, only a fraction of the cost of foreign methods. This method has already been adopted in Shanghai, Shandong, Sichuan, and other places.

    土法造钢丝绳
    一块空场地和两台木制的手摇车，就可以大量生产目前各个工业部门感到稀缺的钢丝绳。
    冶金工业部7月底在天津钢丝合股厂召开了钢丝绳生产现场促进会，组织各地代表参观这个厂制造钢丝绳的土办法。这个厂共有一百四十多个职工，采用了土办法后，今年的产量可以从原计划的一千五百多吨跃进到二千二百吨，能生产直径三到三十八公厘、长达五百公尺的钢丝绳；不仅能生产一般结构的钢丝绳，还可以制造电缆，供应航空、水利、电力、煤炭等各部门。
    各地代表总结了天津钢丝合股厂土办法的经验，认为办一个年产一百吨的钢丝绳厂，只需一块平地，两台木制手摇车，配上两对铸铁齿轮就行了，新工人半个月就能掌握生产。这样的厂一星期就能建成，投资只需二百五十元，只有洋办法的几十分之一。这种办法，目前在上海、山东、四川等地都已采用。
