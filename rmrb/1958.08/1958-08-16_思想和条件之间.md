　　Between Thought and Conditions
　　Hua Ren
    To achieve a great harvest in production, one must first achieve a great harvest in thought. The report on the rectification campaign by the Jiaxing Prefectural Party Committee published today is a concrete example. After the early rice harvest, the Jiaxing Prefectural Party Committee selected two typical cases, using the method of presenting output, comparing high and low yields, and finding the reasons, to conduct rectification, specifically illustrating the relationship between ideological harvest and production harvest.

    Thought is the foundation of all work. With correct thought, one can generate strength, determine direction, set targets, and thus continuously revolutionize and continuously leap forward. More than a year of rectification experience has shown that where rectification is grasped tightly and thoroughly, the masses' awareness is unprecedentedly enhanced, and their enthusiasm is particularly high. What follows is a great harvest in production. Conversely, where rectification, this key link, is not brought up, or where rectification is not carried out thoroughly, the masses' enthusiasm is not great, or not great enough. Consequently, production is not done very well, or even very poorly.

    In the Jiaxing Special District, there was a saying, "Golden Pinghu, Silver Jiashan, Iron Haiyan," using words like "Gold," "Silver," and "Iron" to indicate the differences between these counties. Haiyan County being likened to "Iron" naturally meant it was inferior to Golden Pinghu and Silver Jiashan. However, because the Haiyan County Party Committee grasped rectification as the key link, repeatedly launched struggles against right-leaning conservative thinking, and at the same time seriously criticized decentralism and individualism within the county party committee, it liberated the thinking of the vast number of cadres and motivated the masses to work hard in production, finally winning the honorary title of "Thousand-Jin County." However, Pinghu County, known as "Golden Pinghu," lagged far behind Haiyan County in production because some members of the county party committee were stagnant, and some even clung to the view that "Golden Pinghu can keep up even while dragging its shoes." More importantly, they did not raise the key link of rectification and thoroughly sweep away various ideological obstacles.

    Now, the Jiaxing Prefectural Party Committee has timely used the method of rectification to summarize the experience and lessons in this regard, which is of positive significance. It tells people that as long as you work hard, places with poor conditions can catch up with places with good conditions; if you do not work hard, places with good conditions will fall behind places with poor conditions. This proves that conditions can be transformed, and the key to transformation lies in people. May all believers in "conditionism" receive positive and negative education from this.

　　思想和条件之间
　　华仁
    要求得生产上的大丰收，必先求得思想上的大丰收。今天发表的嘉兴地委整风的报道，就是一个具体的例证。在早稻丰收以后，嘉兴地委选择了两种典型，采用摆产量、比高低、找原因的方法，进行整风，具体地说明了思想丰收和生产丰收的关系。
    思想，是一切工作的基础，有了正确的思想，就能产生力量，定出方向，制出指标，从而不断革命，不断跃进。一年多的整风经验说明，那里整风抓的紧，搞得透，那里群众的觉悟就空前提高，干劲就特别大。随之而来的，就是生产上的大丰收。反之，那里没有把整风这个纲提起来，或者整风进行得不彻底，那里群众的干劲就不大，或者不够大。随之而来的，生产搞的就不很好，甚至很不好。
    在嘉兴专区，向有“金平湖、银嘉善、铁海盐”的称呼，在地名上面冠以“金”、“银”、“铁”等类字样，表示这几个县的不同。海盐县被比喻为“铁”，自然比金平湖、银嘉善差了，但是，由于海盐县委抓紧了整风这个纲，反复地开展反右倾保守思想的斗争，同时严肃地批判了县委内部的分散主义和个人主义，因而使广大干部思想解放，带动群众努力生产，终于获得了千斤县的荣誉称号。而素有“金平湖”之称的平湖县，由于县委的部分成员暮气沉沉，有的还抱着“金平湖拖着鞋子也能跟上”的观点。更重要的是，他们没有提起整风这个纲，彻底扫清各种思想障碍，因而在生产上就远远落后于海盐县。
    现在，嘉兴地委及时用整风的方法，总结了这方面的经验和教训，这是有积极意义的。它告诉人们：只要努力，条件差的地方可以赶上条件好的地方；如果不努力，条件好的地方也会落后于条件差的地方。由此证明，条件是可以转化的，转化的关键就在于人。愿一切“条件论”者，从这里受到正面的和反面的教育。
