Our country's various nationalities and regions possess a wealth of folk literature treasures. Amidst the unprecedented flourishing of mass creation, the Great Leap Forward folk songs are so numerous as to be uncountable. Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, collected 430,000 new folk songs from last winter to this spring, while Yu County, Henan, collected 510,000 in the same period.

Since liberation, many revolutionary folk songs from old revolutionary base areas and traditional works of various nationalities have been unearthed. Recently, more discoveries have been made in the folk song collecting movement in various places, and some works have already been partially collected. Such as the ballads and legends about Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Jiangxi, Hunan and other places, the ballads and legends about the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces and Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin in the three northeastern provinces, the ballads and legends about Liu Zhidan in northern Shaanxi, the legends about the Boxers in Hebei, the ballads and legends about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Jiangsu, and so on. In every historical period of the Chinese people's revolution, as well as in the more distant Opium War, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and the Boxer era, there are many heroic stories, legends, and ballads. The most gratifying thing is the long narrative poem "Red Army Woman" circulating in the Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi, and the long, thousand-line "Laborer's Record" recited by veteran workers in Anyuan, Jiangxi, which records Comrade Shaoqi's leadership of the Anyuan workers in their struggle.

The epics, long narrative poems, and famous folk legends and stories of various nationalities, in addition to the "Ashima" of the Sani people, "The Song of the A'xi People" of the A'xi people, "Miao King Zhang Chunyan" of the Miao people, "Gada Meilin" of the Mongolian people, "Ma Wuduo and Duodoumei" of the Hui people, "Elopement Tune" of the Lisu people, "Zhong Jiu's Riot over Grain Transport," "Chongyang Double Lotus" of the Han people, and other works that have been published in recent years, the long stories and epics that are currently being translated and collected in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region include the stories of "Jianggar" and "Geser," "The Python God," "Genghis Khan's Two Steeds," and the heroic epic "Khule Battur," which is more than 40,000 lines long. Many traditional epics and narrative poems have been discovered in Guizhou. Taking the Miao nationality as an example, 32 long and short ancient songs and narrative poems are already known. In addition, there are the "Meige" and "Ebian·Samuluo" of the Yi people, "Talking About Heaven and Earth" of the Zhuang people, and "The Legend of King Gesar" of the Tibetan people, and so on. In the "classics" of many ethnic groups, there are also beautiful folk narrative poems and legends recorded, such as 40 long narrative poems and more than 500 legends in the classics of the Dai people, including "Langga Xihe" (i.e., "Ten-Headed Prince"), which is more than 40,000 lines long. These works are still widely circulated among the masses today.

    解放以来，老革命根据地的革命民歌和各民族的传统作品已经发掘了不少，最近在采风运动中各地都有更多的发现，有的作品已经进行了部分的搜集工作。如江西、湖南等地关于毛主席、朱总司令的歌谣和传说故事、东北三省关于抗日联军和杨靖宇、李兆麟的歌谣和传说故事、陕北关于刘志丹的歌谣和传说故事、河北关于义和团的传说故事、江苏关于太平天国的歌谣和传说故事等等。在中国人民革命的各个历史时期以及更远的鸦片战争、太平天国和义和团时代，都有着很多的英雄故事、传说和歌谣。最可喜的是在广西僮族自治区流传着“红军女”的长篇叙事歌，在江西安源的老工人中传诵着长达千行的记述少奇同志领导安源工人进行斗争的“劳工记”。
    各民族的史诗、长篇叙事诗、著名的民间传说、故事，除了近年来已经出版的撒尼族的“阿诗玛”、阿细族的“阿细人的歌”、苗族的“苗王张春岩”、蒙古族的“嘎达梅林”、回族的“马五多与朵豆妹”、傈僳族的“逃婚调”、汉族的“钟九闹漕”“崇阳双合莲”等等作品外，内蒙古自治区最近正在翻译和搜集的长篇故事和史诗有“江葛尔”、“格斯尔”的故事、“蟒神”、“成吉思汗的两匹骏马”和长达四万多行的英雄史诗“忽勒巴特尔”等。贵州发现的传统史诗、叙事诗很多，单就苗族而论，就已知道的长短古歌和叙事诗就有三十二部。此外，还有彝族的“梅葛”、“俄变·撒木落”，僮族的“谈天说地”，藏族的“哥萨王传”等等。在不少民族的“经典”中，也记录了优美的民间叙事诗和传说故事，如傣族的经典中长篇叙事诗就有四十部，传说故事有五百多个，其中有长达四万行以上的“兰嘎西贺”（即“十头王子”）这些作品今天还广泛流传在群众中。
