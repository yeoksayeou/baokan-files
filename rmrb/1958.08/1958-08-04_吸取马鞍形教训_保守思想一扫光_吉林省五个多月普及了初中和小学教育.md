Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd: Implementing the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and Chairman Mao's policy of combining education with productive labor, Jilin Province boldly mobilized the masses in education, used "walking on two legs," and continuously defeated conservatism and dogmatism. After more than five months of effort, the province has popularized junior high and primary education. This is another significant achievement of Jilin Province in the cultural revolution following the basic elimination of illiteracy throughout the province.

Before March 1958, Jilin Province had more than 6,800 primary schools with more than 1.42 million students (including over-age children). This year, 127 new public primary schools and 4,117 private primary schools were added. The province now has a total of 11,044 primary schools, averaging eleven primary schools per township. Primary schools have enrolled 560,000 new students this year. On average, one in every six people in the province is a primary school student. To date, more than 1.64 million of the province's more than 1.7 million school-age children aged seven to twelve have been enrolled, with an enrollment rate of 96.4%, exceeding the national standard for universal primary education. This year, 2,736 new private middle schools, agricultural middle schools, and other types of vocational middle schools and 63 public middle schools were added in the province. Together with the original 226 schools, the province now has 3,025 secondary schools, averaging three middle schools per township. This year, more than 300,000 primary school graduates and previous years' primary school graduates who did not go on to further education have all been enrolled, reaching the national standard for basic universal junior high school education. The province now has an average of one middle school student for every 30-plus people. During the upsurge of rural socialism from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, Jilin Province's education saw a leap forward. The cities of Jilin and Changchun and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture were close to universal primary education. The number of first-grade primary school students enrolled in the province increased from 200,000 in 1955 to more than 320,000. In that year, more than 990,000 school-age children were enrolled in primary schools throughout the province, accounting for 66.07% of the total number of school-age children. Middle schools in the province also saw significant growth during this period. Based on this situation, the province formulated two plans for universal primary education in three to five years and five to seven years. However, the "anti-rash advance" wave soon emerged, immediately pushing this leap-forward situation into a low ebb. Some conservative and dogmatic elements in the education administrative departments, under the pretext of "consolidation and improvement" and "steady progress," prevented the province's education from developing rapidly, fearing that too rapid development would affect the balance of the plan. Dogmatists unilaterally demanded "regularization," advocating that mass-run schools must be approved by the province, with the conditions of complete school buildings, complete teaching equipment, and a reliable source of tuition fees of 13 to 15 yuan per year for each middle school student and 9 yuan for each primary school student (this standard was equal to or even exceeded that of public schools). Therefore, by 1957, the province had only approved eighteen "truly qualified" private middle schools. Other private schools that had been established in the past few years were taken over by the state on the grounds of "regularization" and "difficulties for farmers in running schools." The number of students enrolled in the province decreased compared to 1956. Under this low ebb, the province's plan to universalize primary schools was postponed until ten to twelve years later to be completed, and no one dared to think about the plan to universalize middle schools.

After the great leap forward situation re-emerged across the country last winter, Jilin Province accepted the lessons of the "anti-rash advance." Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, on the basis of the rectification campaign for all, it also launched a criticism of right-leaning conservative ideas and dogmatism in the cultural and educational undertaking. In March of this year, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee convened a work conference on cultural and educational undertaking. After the meeting, the province's education immediately entered a new leap forward upsurge, formulating a leap forward plan to universalize primary and junior middle schools in one year. At the same time, it decentralized the power to run schools and encouraged the masses to run schools; it also successively criticized new conservative ideas such as public schools "wearing hats" (i.e., private classes attached to public schools) and "walking on two legs in one trouser leg," so that the thinking of cadres and the masses was continuously liberated; and it resolutely followed the direction of diligence and thrift in running schools and part-work, part-study, establishing many agricultural middle schools, vocational middle schools, and more private primary schools in accordance with local conditions and simple methods. Because all types of schools had reliable labor sources, the funding for running schools also had reliable sources, and the schools were consolidated.

The funding for private primary schools was also solved by the masses themselves. The masses voluntarily contributed the proceeds from half or one working day per year per laborer as teachers' salaries. Schools mostly used cooperative mills, warehouses, clubs, offices, and night schools as school buildings. The masses ran schools like celebrating a happy event, beating gongs and drums, and donating tables and chairs. Especially after the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" penetrated the hearts of the people, and the idea of settling for the middle reaches in the cultural revolution was further hit hard. The high tide of the masses running schools was surging. In many places, all kinds of schools held opening ceremonies one after another. In some areas, universal primary and secondary education was achieved within three to five days, and in others, within ten days and a half months. (Attached pictures)

### 吸取马鞍形教训　保守思想一扫光  吉林省五个多月普及了初中和小学教育

    吸取马鞍形教训　保守思想一扫光
    吉林省五个多月普及了初中和小学教育
    据新华社长春3日电　吉林省贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线和毛主席的教育和劳动生产相结合的方针，在教育事业中放手发动群众，运用“两条腿走路”，不断战胜保守主义和教条主义，经过五个多月的努力，已在全省普及了初中和小学教育。这是吉林省在文化革命中继全省基本扫除文盲以后的又一重大成就。
    吉林省原有（1958年3月以前）小学六千八百多所，学生一百四十二万（包括超龄儿童）多名。今年新增加公办小学一百二十七所，民办小学四千一百一十七所，全省共有小学一万一千零四十四所，达到平均每乡有十一所小学。小学今年增收新生五十六万名。全省平均每六个人中便有一名小学生，到目前为止，全省一百七十万多名七至十二周岁的学龄儿童中，已有一百六十四万多名入学，入学率达96.4％，超过国家规定的普及小学教育标准。今年全省新增加民办中学、农业中学和其他各种类型职业中学二千七百三十六所和公立中学六十三所，加上原有二百二十六所，全省已有中等学校三千○二十五所，平均每乡有三所中学。今年高小毕业生和往年没有升学的高小毕业生共三十多万名今年已全部入学，达到国家规定基本普及初中教育的标准。全省现在平均每三十多人中便有一名中学生。1955年冬到1956年春农村社会主义高潮期间，吉林省的教育事业曾一度出现了跃进局面，吉林、长春两市和延边朝鲜族自治州已接近普及小学教育。全省小学招收一年级新生人数由1955年的二十万增加到三十二万多名。这一年全省小学在学的学龄儿童达九十九万多名，占学龄儿童总数的66.07％。全省中学在这一时期也有了很大的增长。根据这种情况，全省拟订了三至五年和五至七年普及小学教育的两个方案。但不久“反冒进”风浪兴起，立刻把这种跃进形势打入低潮。一些教育行政部门的保守主义和教条主义者以“巩固提高”，“稳步前进”为借口，阻止全省教育事业的飞跃发展，怕发展太快影响计划平衡。教条主义者更是片面要求“正规化”，主张群众办学必须经省批准，条件是有完备的校舍，完整的教学设备，每个中学生每年必须有缴学杂费十三到十五元、小学生必须有缴学杂费九元的可靠来源（这个标准和公立学校相等甚至超过）等等。因此，到1957年的时候，全省只批准了十八个“真正合格”的民办中学。其他在过去几年中已经办起来的民办学校，在“正规化”和“农民办学困难”的理由下，都由国家接管过来。全省学生入学人数比1956年下降了。在这个低潮下，全省普及小学的计划竟被推迟到在十至十二年以后才能完成，至于普及中学的计划更是无人敢想。
    去年冬季全国各地重新出现大跃进的形势以后，吉林省接受了
  “反冒进”的经验教训，在省委领导下，在全民整风的基础上，也对文教事业中的右倾保守思想和教条主义展开了批判。今年3月，中共吉林省委主持召开了文教工作会议。会后全省教育事业立即进入新的跃进的高潮，订出了一年普及小学和初级中学的跃进规划，同时下放办学权力，鼓励群众办学；还先后批判了公立学校“戴帽子”（即公立学校中附设民办班次）、“两条腿穿到一个裤腿里走路”等新的保守思想，使干部和群众的思想不断解放；并坚决依照勤工俭学、半工半读的方向，因地制宜、因陋就简地创办了许多农业中学、职业中学和更多的民办小学。由于各类学校都有可靠的劳动门路，因此办学经费也都有可靠的来源，学校办起来都得到了巩固。
    民办小学经费也由群众自己解决。群众自愿每年每个劳动力献出半个或一个劳动日所得，作为教师的工资。学校大都利用合作社碾房、仓库、俱乐部、办公室、夜校作校舍。群众自办学校像办喜事一样，敲锣打鼓，献桌献椅。尤其在中共“八大”二次会议以后，党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线深入人心，文化革命中安居中游思想进一步受到打击，群众自办学校的高潮汹涌澎湃，许多地方各类学校纷纷举行开学典礼，有的地区三、五天，有的地区十天半月之内便都普及了中、小学教育。（附图片）
