Three Cheers for the Realization of the "Four Modernizations"
By Our Special Correspondent Kang Zhuo

The People's Commune has further liberated and developed the productive forces. In Xushui County, the sight of people wearing white cloth caps and aprons in every village is a sign of the People's Commune further liberating the productive forces.

These people in white caps and aprons, although their clothing styles may vary slightly from village to village, all perform the same work. They are all cooks in the canteens.

Dasi Gezhuang, a village of 124 households visited by Chairman Mao, has a total of four public canteens. One each for the two production teams, one for the kindergarten and the Happiness Home, and one for the four directly subordinate platoons: machinery, industry, bumper harvest, and carts. In the past, each household cooked for itself; now, the four canteens use a total of twenty people. In addition, there are three nursery workers in the kindergarten, four workers in the sewing factory, and seven workers in the grain processing plant. These four items alone have freed up 88 laborers. Dasi Gezhuang has only 174 male and female laborers; their well-drilling tasks were completed long ago, but those working outside to repair reservoirs and those engaged in industry in the village account for 23 people. Now, they have 266 people working in the fields. Moreover, in the past, people ate at various homes, which took time to assemble; now, meals are unified, and with militarized action, each person increases their labor by three hours per day. With such careful calculations, the liberation and improvement of labor is more than doubled compared to the past.

So, how are the canteens doing? Chairman Mao saw the menu at Dasi Gezhuang, which read as follows:

Steamed buns: 7 fen per jin; filled buns: 8 fen per jin; thick porridge: 1 fen per bowl; thin porridge: 0.5 fen per bowl; noodle soup: 2 fen per bowl; cowpea soup: 1 fen per bowl; tomato soup: 1.5 fen per bowl; stir-fried cowpeas, zucchini, eggplant: 2 fen per plate each; pickled vegetables, scallions: 0.5 fen per plate each.

This is not the entirety of the food offered by the Dasi Gezhuang public canteen. They also eat fried dough sticks every Saturday afternoon. The Dasi Gezhuang canteen is not the best-run; the Renli Village canteen is even better. They have a small stove and provide rice and eggs for guests and the sick. However, among the canteens I have eaten at, the level of Dasi Gezhuang is relatively common. Now, all township and commune cadres, those working in the countryside, and workers in industry, commerce, and postal services in towns all eat in the People's Commune canteens. This method is prompting all cadres to devise ways to improve the level of the canteens. Recently, there have been canteens that maintain a cost of around five yuan per month while still providing good food. The county is preparing to hold a second on-site conference to promote these experiences.

A second on-site conference means that one has already been held. Yes, no one can imagine that canteens will be run perfectly everywhere from the start. When Dasi Gezhuang first started eating in the canteen, there was an incident where a daughter who returned to her parents' home from out of town for a visit could not get a meal. In some canteens, it took three hours to serve one meal in the first few days. In July, with the rain pouring down, some women slipped on the road while carrying food, and their bowls and utensils shattered on the ground. Also, what about the management system: should meals be served by production unit or by household? Should there be a fixed quantity, or should people be allowed to eat as much as they want? How should accounts be kept? Should food and vegetable coupons be issued, and is this a good idea? Regarding just the food and vegetable coupon issue, one village used them for a few days, and the village party secretary said to me:

"This won't work! Which farmer is like you cadres, carrying a small leather case in their pocket? We sweat a lot, and the coupons will rot! If it rains, the coupons will get wet! When we're working, we throw our short cloth shirts on the side of the field. When it's time to eat, we reach into our shirts, and the coupons are gone!"

Not only are there countless problems, but a few people in some canteens have even made a fuss about withdrawing. Who is making the fuss? Upon investigation, it turns out to be the well-to-do middle peasants. They say the food is not good. Is this really the case? No, they see that once the canteen is established, grain will not be distributed to individual households, which exposes the capitalist root of their hoarding grain. Therefore, by holding on-site conferences, spreading advanced experiences, and engaging in airing of views and debates, the canteens are consolidated and move forward. There have also been one or two cases of sabotage and theft by individual landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, which have been handled by the People's Commune's political and legal public security departments. These problems have raised the vigilance of the commune members and promoted the development of the canteen and commune system from the negative side.

Indeed, no one can tear down the canteen. In Xushui County, with a total population of 318,000, more than 312,000 people are already eating in the canteens. The county has 1,554 canteens with 6,882 cooks. Calculating by household, 55,000 people are saved just from cooking, which is a huge force for consolidating the canteens.

Now, every canteen is running vegetable gardens and raising fat pigs, and some are already arranging the meals for the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. All systems are on the right track, and the quantitative supply of grain has been abolished. A canteen with more than one hundred people consumes more than forty or fifty jin of grain on the first day of open eating. The second day, it exceeds by ten or twenty jin, and the third day, it no longer exceeds. On average, old and young save grain. Shuangying Village saved 120 jin in sixteen days for 148 people. Since the establishment of the People's Commune, the county's canteens have saved 200,500 jin of grain when calculated by population. The grain saved by each person is used as their own reserve, which they can use freely. Since Chairman Mao visited the canteen, now all 6,000+ people in white clothes and hats are working hard to run the canteen better. Many canteens are installing small stoves and adding stir-fry woks.

I have only talked about the canteen here. It should also include the comprehensive promotion of kindergartens, sewing machines, and the motorization of rice and flour processing. These are the "four modernizations" of the Xushui People's Commune in the transformation of people's lifestyles. Moreover, each "modernization" is full of profound meaning. Zhang Aizhi, the sewing worker at Dasi Gezhuang who met Chairman Mao, finished her backlog of work overnight and then went to the production team to mend torn clothes and trousers during meal times. In addition, shoe factories, bathhouses, and barbers are also being gradually promoted. I remember when the commune members debated the superiority of the canteen, many women talked about the heavy and arduous housework in the past. I also remember what the short-haired girl who manages the generator in Dasi Gezhuang said. She said she graduated from the family university and also said:

"Do you still want us to go back to those 'four stations'? It can't be done!"

The "four modernizations" of the Xushui People's Commune have completely liberated women from the four stations of grinding, milling, cooking, and sleeping. The "four modernizations" of Xushui bring joy to all the people. (End of this section, to be continued)

　　徐水人民公社颂
　　三、“四化”齐来万众欢
　　本报特约记者　康濯
    人民公社进一步解放和发展了生产力。在徐水县每个村子里都能见到的头戴白布帽罩和身系白布围裙的人们，就是人民公社进一步解放了生产力的标志。
    这些戴白帽罩和系白围裙的人们，尽管每个村子的服装样式不完全一致，他们的工作却都是一样。他们都是食堂的炊事员。
    毛主席到过的大寺各庄，是个一百二十四户的村子，共有四个公共食堂。两个生产连队各一个，幼儿园和幸福院一个，机器、工业、丰产、大车四个直属排共一个。过去一户一人做饭，如今四个食堂共用二十人。外加幼儿园的保育员三人，缝纫工厂四个工人和粮食加工厂七个工人，这四项就解放了八十八个劳动力。大寺各庄只有一百七十四个男女劳力，他们的机井任务早已完成，但出外修水库的和在本村搞工业的竟也占去了二十三人。现在，他们却有二百六十六人上地。并且，过去是吃百家饭，集合费时；现在统一开饭，再加行动军事化，每人每天就要增加三个钟头的劳动。这么精打细算，现在比过去解放和提高劳动力一倍还多。
    那末，食堂办的怎么样？毛主席曾在大寺各庄看过那里的饭菜价目表，那张表的内容如下：
    馒头每斤七分，包子每斤八分，稠粥每碗一分，稀粥每碗半分，菜汤面条每碗二分，豆角汤每碗一分，西红柿汤每碗一分五，炒豆角、西葫芦、茄子每盘各二分，咸菜、小葱每盘各半分。
    这并不是大寺各庄公共食堂的全部饭菜。他们每星期六下午还要吃一顿炸油条。大寺各庄的食堂也不是办得最好的，仁里村的食堂就要好一些。那里设有小灶，有大米、鸡蛋供给客人和病号。不过，在我吃过的食堂里边，大寺各庄的水平比较普遍。现在全县所有乡社干部、下乡干部和市镇上的工、商、邮电人员，都全部去人民公社食堂吃饭，这个办法促使得所有的干部都正在想方设计提高食堂的水平。最近已经出现了每月保持五元上下而又吃得很好的食堂，县里正准备召开第二次现场会议来推广经验。
    第二次现场会议，这就是说，已经开过一次。是的，谁也不能幻想刚一办食堂就到处都办的很好。大寺各庄在刚吃食堂的时候，就出现过一个从外地回娘家探亲的闺女没吃上饭的事件。有的食堂刚办的几天，开一顿饭就得三个钟头。7月雨水淋淋，有的妇女打了饭路上一滑，饭菜碗罐摔满地。还有管理制度，是按生产单位吃饭，还是按户吃饭？是定量供应，还是让人敞口吃？到底要怎么记账？有的是发饭票菜票，这么作好不好？仅仅一个饭票菜票问题，有一个村使用了几天，村支部书记就对我说：
    “这不行！哪个农民像你们干部那样，屁股兜里带个小皮匣？咱们出两身汗，票票给沤烂了！下一场雨，票票湿了！做活的工夫小布衫往地边一扔，吃饭了，一掏小布衫，票票又丢了的！”
    不仅有着数不清的问题，个别食堂还发生过少数人闹退出的事。什么人闹？一查，富裕中农。他们说，饭菜不好。果真如此么？不，他们是看到食堂一办，粮食将要分不到家，而这就又挖出了他们存粮积宝的一条资本主义根子。于是，开现场会议，传播先进经验，鸣放辩论，食堂就又巩固地前进。也有个别地富反坏分子闹过一两起放毒和偷盗案件，已由人民公社的政法公安部门处理。这些问题倒提高了社员们的警惕，从反面推动了食堂和公社制度的发展。
    的确是谁也推不倒食堂。徐水全县三十一万八千多人，已经有三十一万二千多人吃食堂。全县一千五百五十四个食堂，六千八百八十二人做饭，按户计算，仅仅做饭的就节省五万五千人，这便是一股巩固食堂的巨大力量。
    现在每个食堂都经营了菜园和喂了肥猪，有的已在安排八月中秋的饭食。一切制度都走上了正轨，并且取消了粮食的定量供应。一个百多人的食堂，头一天敞口吃饭，要超过四五十斤粮食；第二天超过一二十斤，第三天就不再超过，老小平均核算，还得节约粮食。双营村一百四十八人在十六天中就节约一百二十斤。建立人民公社以来，按人口定量计算，全县食堂就节约了二十万零五千斤粮食。每个人节约的粮食，都作为各人的储备，自己可以自由动用。由于毛主席视察的时候参观了食堂，现在全县六千多白衣白帽的人都正在努力把食堂办的更好。许多食堂都正在安装小灶和添置炒瓢。
    我这里只谈到了食堂。还应该加上幼儿园、缝纫机和米面加工的动力化的全面推行，这才是徐水人民公社在人们生活方式变革上的“四化”。并且，每一“化”都全是意味无穷。大寺各庄见过毛主席的缝纫工张爱芝，连夜就做完存活，以后还在吃饭的工夫下连队去缝补破衣裤。此外，鞋厂、澡堂和理发员也在逐步推广。我记得公社社员们在辩论食堂优越性时候，许多妇女所诉说的过去家务劳动的繁重和艰苦。我也记得大寺各庄管理发电机的那个短头发姑娘说过的话。她说，她是家庭大学毕业；又说：
    “还要咱们回到那‘四台’边去？办不到啦！”
    徐水人民公社的“四化”使得妇女从碾、磨、锅、炕四台边彻底解放出来，徐水的“四化”使得万民欢乐。　（本段完，全文未完）
