Xinhua News Agency, August 20th. The Secretary-General of the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation), Zhang Lianhua, announced at a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists held in Beijing this afternoon that, in protest against the International Olympic Committee and eight other international sports organizations illegally recognizing the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique's sports organization, the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) has already sent letters on August 19th to the International Olympic Committee, the International Swimming Federation, the International Association of Athletics Federations, the International Basketball Federation, the International Weightlifting Federation, the International Shooting Union, the International Wrestling Federation, the Union Cycliste Internationale, and the Asian Table Tennis Union, formally announcing its non-recognition of the International Olympic Committee, severing all relations with it, and withdrawing from the aforementioned international sports organizations.

Zhang Lianhua pointed out that the International Olympic Committee, under the control of Avery Brundage, a faithful executor of U.S. imperialist policy, first obstructed the recognition of the legitimate status of the Chinese Olympic Committee. Then, when this obstruction failed, it used underhanded tactics to include the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is despised by the 600 million Chinese people, in the list of national Olympic committees recognized by the International Olympic Committee, without any discussion or decision. The other eight international sports organizations, including the International Amateur Swimming Federation, which had previously confirmed the legitimate status of the All-China Sports Federation, also accepted the Chiang clique as a member one after another under the manipulation of certain elements with ulterior political motives, disregarding our protests. This practice is a complete violation of the principle stipulated in the charters of these international sports organizations that only one association in a country should be recognized. This series of conspiracies by International Olympic Committee President Brundage and others is undoubtedly a component of the "Two Chinas" conspiracy orchestrated by U.S. imperialism. Brundage and others are precisely serving the political conspiracy of U.S. imperialism under the guise of "sports and politics being unrelated."

Zhang Lianhua said that people have long seen that the United States' China policy, whether it is non-recognition of New China or the creation of "Two Chinas," has been a complete failure, so much so that the U.S. State Department recently had to issue a memorandum to make desperate excuses. However, the International Olympic Committee is willing to be reduced to a tool of this bankrupt U.S. China policy. Under these circumstances, the Chinese Olympic Committee has made the solemn decision not to recognize the International Olympic Committee and to sever all relations with it.

Zhang Lianhua said that the Chinese people and Chinese athletes feel extremely indignant at the above-mentioned acts of wantonly undermining the charters of international sports organizations and conspiring to create "Two Chinas." The Chinese people's position is steadfast and unshakeable. There is only one China in the world, and that is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people will never allow the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to create "Two Chinas" to succeed.

Zhang Lianhua said that Dong Shouyi, the Chinese member of the International Olympic Committee, has already written to International Olympic Committee President Brundage on August 19th, announcing his refusal to cooperate with him and his refusal to have any contact with the International Olympic Committee under his control. In this letter, Dong Shouyi pointed out that the facts show that Brundage is a faithful pawn who deliberately serves the political conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to create "Two Chinas." A person like him, who taints the Olympic spirit and violates the Olympic Charter, is no longer qualified to serve as President of the International Olympic Committee.

Zhang Lianhua concluded by saying that there are many gentlemen in the International Olympic Committee and the above-mentioned international sports organizations who are just, and we have always been willing to cooperate with them and have done our best. He stated that although the Chinese Olympic Committee does not recognize the International Olympic Committee and withdraws from these international sports organizations, Chinese sports workers and athletes are still willing to strengthen friendly contacts with friends in the international sports community. Only when the International Olympic Committee and these international sports organizations correct their mistakes and rescind the recognition of the Chiang clique's "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" can we reconsider the issue of cooperation with them.

　　不许“两个中国”的阴谋得逞
    我奥委会举行记者招待会宣布退出国际奥委会
    新华社20日讯  中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）秘书长张联华今天下午在北京举行的中、外记者招待会上宣布：中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）为了抗议国际奥林匹克委员会和其他八个国际体育组织非法承认台湾蒋帮体育组织，已经在19日写信给国际奥林匹克委员会、国际游泳、田径、篮球、举重、射击、摔跤、自行车联合会及亚洲乒乓球联合会，正式宣布不承认国际奥林匹克委员会，断绝同它的一切关系；并且退出上述的国际体育组织。
    张联华指出，国际奥委会在美帝国主义政策的忠实执行者布伦代奇的把持下，初则阻挠承认中国奥委会的合法地位，继则在阻挠不成的情况下，在承认中国奥委会以外，又以偷天换日的手法，没有经过任何讨论和决定，便把被六亿中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”列入国际奥委会承认的国家奥委会的名单中。其他八个国际体育组织包括原先已经确认中华全国体育总会的合法地位的国际业余游泳联合会等，也在某些怀着不可告人的政治目的的分子操纵下，不顾我们的抗议，先后接受蒋帮为会员。这种做法是完全违背这些国际体育组织章程所规定的在一个国家中只承认一个协会的原则的。国际奥委会主席布伦代奇等人的这一系列阴谋，无疑是美帝国主义所策划的“两个中国”阴谋的组成部分。布伦代奇等正是在“体育与政治无关”的幌子下，在为美帝国主义的政治阴谋效劳。
    张联华说，人们早已看到，美国的对华政策，不论是不承认新中国，或是制造“两个中国”，都已经彻底破产，以致美国国务院最近不得不发表一个备忘录来进行绝望的狡辩。但是国际奥委会却甘愿沦为美国这种破产的对华政策的工具，在这种情况下，中国奥委会才作出不承认国际奥委会并同它断绝一切关系的严正决定。
    张联华说，中国人民和中国运动员对于上述肆意破坏国际体育组织章程，阴谋制造“两个中国”的行为感到无比的愤慨。中国人民的立场是坚定不移的。世界上只有一个中国，那就是中华人民共和国。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。中国人民决不允许美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋得逞。
    张联华说，国际奥委会中国委员董守义已经在19日写信给国际奥委会主席布伦代奇，宣布拒绝同他合作，并且拒绝同他所把持的国际奥委会发生任何联系。董守义在这封信中指出，事实表明布伦代奇是一个蓄意为美帝制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋效劳的忠实走卒，像他这样沾污奥林匹克精神、破坏奥林匹克宪章的人已经没有任何资格担任国际奥委会的主席。
    张联华最后说，国际奥委会和上述这些国际体育组织中有不少先生是公正的，我们一向愿意同他们合作，并已尽了我们最大的努力。他表示，中国奥委会虽然不承认国际奥委会并且退出这几个国际体育组织，但是中国体育工作者和运动员仍然愿意加强同国际体育界的朋友们的友好接触。只有当国际奥委会和这些国际体育组织改正错误，撤销承认蒋帮“中华全国体育协进会”，我们才能重新考虑同它们的合作问题。
