Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 22nd: The Hong Kong Zhonghua Middle School's premises were ordered to be closed by the Hong Kong British authorities on the 20th. This is another act of persecution against the Chinese people's education undertaking in Hong Kong, following the Hong Kong authorities' forcible deportation of Du Boqui, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School.

People here believe that the closure of the Zhonghua Middle School is a premeditated action by the Hong Kong Education Department. According to Mr. Fabien, a building inspection officer of the Hong Kong Public Works Department, as early as March this year, the Hong Kong Education Department, based on the "1957 Education (Amendment) Ordinance" specifically designed to persecute Hong Kong's education undertaking, requested the Hong Kong Public Works Department to "certify" whether the construction condition of the Zhonghua Middle School was "good." On April 1st, the Public Works Department sent personnel to Zhonghua Middle School for inspection, but made no comment afterward. It wasn't until May 19th that the Public Works Department suddenly notified Zhonghua Middle School that the school building was "dangerous" and that it would apply to the Hong Kong authorities' court for a "closure order." On May 31st, the Hong Kong authorities, disregarding Zhonghua Middle School's reasoned arguments, ordered the upper floor of this two-story building to be closed. On August 20th, the Hong Kong authorities again ordered the closure of the lower floor of the school building. Thus, the entire Zhonghua Middle School premises were restricted by the "closure order" and could not be used.

According to the person in charge of the school, after the Hong Kong Public Works Department personnel came to the school for inspection in April, the school authorities indicated to the Public Works Department that if the school building needed to be repaired, they would accept it, and repeatedly asked the Public Works Department what repairs were needed to make the building safe. Later, the school authorities twice submitted repair drawings designed by qualified architects for approval by the Public Works Department, but the Public Works Department deliberately delayed and never gave Zhonghua Middle School a clear answer. The Hong Kong authorities' court, in handling this incident, disregarded Zhonghua Middle School's appeals and resolutely ruled to close the school building completely, one floor after the other. This clearly proves that the Hong Kong British authorities are making excuses and deliberately sabotaging the patriotic education undertaking of the Chinese people.

Educational circles in Hong Kong expressed great indignation after learning about the unreasonable closure of Zhonghua Middle School's premises by the Hong Kong British authorities. Wu Kangmin, the principal of Pui Kiu Middle School, pointed out that this incident shows that the Hong Kong Education Department is widely using the all-encompassing clauses in the "Education (Amendment) Ordinance" to create various excuses to persecute patriotic schools of the Chinese people. Huang Chengshun, the principal of Heung To Middle School, said that the consecutive incidents of Pui Kiu Middle School and Zhonghua Middle School being persecuted within half a month fully expose the conspiracy of the Hong Kong British authorities to systematically sabotage the patriotic schools of the Chinese people. Huang Jianli, the principal of Han Wah Middle School, as well as the persons in charge of Hong Kong Fujian Middle School and Yuqun Middle School and other schools, also made speeches protesting the new persecution jointly staged by the Hong Kong Education Department and the Public Works Department.

### 又一次摧残中国人民爱国教育事业  香港英国当局无理封闭中华中学校舍

　　又一次摧残中国人民爱国教育事业
    香港英国当局无理封闭中华中学校舍
    新华社香港22日电　香港中华中学的校舍20日被香港英国当局下令封闭，这是香港当局强行将培侨中学校长杜伯奎递解出境之后对香港中国人民教育事业的又一迫害行动。
    此间人士认为，中华中学校舍的被封闭，是香港教育司署的一项预谋。据香港工务局楼宇视察主任菲宾透露，早在今年3月间，香港教育司就根据专为迫害香港教育事业而订立的“1957年教育（修正）条例”，要求香港工务局“证实”中华中学校舍的建筑状况“是否良好”。4月1日，工务局为此曾派出人员到中华中学检查，但事后并无表示。直到5月19日，工务局突然通知中华中学，说这个学校的校舍“有危险”，要向香港当局法庭申请发出“封闭令”。5月31日，香港当局不顾中华中学的据理力争，竟然下令将这所两层建筑物的楼上封闭。8月20日，香港当局又下令封闭校舍的下层，这样，中华中学的整个校舍都被“封闭令”所限制而不能使用。
    据这所学校的负责人说，4月间香港工务局人员前来学校检查后，学校当局向工务局表示，如果要修校舍，他们是可以接受的，并一再向工务局询问需要如何修理才算使楼宇安全。后来，学校当局还两次提出由合格建筑师设计的修理图样，报请工务局批复，但工务局有意拖延，一直不向中华中学作明确的答复。香港当局的法庭在处理这一事件时，也不顾中华中学的申诉，就断然地判决要把这所学校的校舍先后全部封闭。这就明显地证明香港英国当局是在制造借口，蓄意摧残中国人民的爱国教育事业。
    香港教育界人士在获悉中华中学的校舍被香港英国当局无理封闭的消息后，都表示极大的愤慨。培侨中学校长吴康民指出，这一事件表明，香港教育司正在广泛利用“教育（修正）条例”里无所不包的条文，制造种种借口，对中国人民爱国学校进行迫害。香岛中学校长黄承燊说，半个月内接连发生培侨中学和中华中学被迫害的事件，这充分暴露了香港英国当局有计划地摧残中国人民爱国学校的阴谋。汉华中学校长黄建立以及香港福建中学和育群中学等学校的负责人也发表谈话，抗议香港教育司署和工务局串演的新的迫害行动。
