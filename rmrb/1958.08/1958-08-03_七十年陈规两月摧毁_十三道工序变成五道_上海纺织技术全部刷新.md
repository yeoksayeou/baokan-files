Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. The Shanghai cotton textile industry, which had seen little change in its production technology for nearly seventy years, has recently experienced a leap forward in the past two months, rapidly scaling the heights of world textile technology in several aspects.

Shanghai's cotton textile industry, which possesses 30% of the nation's spindles, entered a new stage of technological revolution in June. Workers inspired and promoted each other, creating high-yield carding machines, centrifugal and jet-propelled high-speed spinning spindles, cotton opener-carding combined machines, steel bar roving combined machines (combining carding, drawing, and roving into one process), super-high draft fine spinning machines with 700 to 1200 times draft for spinning fine yarn directly from cotton slivers, single-process warp preparation machines, and shuttle-less weaving machines, among other advanced world textile technologies. After the implementation of these reform projects, workers can abandon the long-used progressive production method of thirteen processes, including opening, carding, drawing, roving, fine spinning, sizing, and weaving. Without sizing and without shuttles for weaving, they only need five processes to weave cotton into cloth. In the past two months, almost every creation of the workers has made production leap forward, doubling the output, which is rare in the history of the textile industry.

Two months ago, many people (mainly engineers and technicians) in the Shanghai textile industry believed that "the best way to carry out technological revolution is to buy new machines from foreign countries and imitate them." Some also believed that "small improvements can be initiated by the majority of the masses, but major technological revolutions are best organized by experts." Others believed that "revolution is necessary, but current production is tight, so it cannot be done on a large scale, but only by a few people, otherwise it will disrupt production." Many others were watching and waiting.

Relevant leading departments, relying on the masses, criticized various conservative ideas. After the Party's General Line was put forward, they held successive meetings, proposing the direction of the current technological revolution in the cotton textile industry: high speed of machinery, single-process production, continuous production, automation of equipment, and high-grade and diversified products. After the rectification movement, and inspired by the General Line, the ideological awareness of the entire industry's workers was raised. With clear goals for the technological revolution, they dared to think boldly and act boldly, and the technological revolution started like a prairie fire. Many important inventions and creations were proposed by workers or young technicians, and the result of collective cooperation and hard work within a few days. These facts shattered the aforementioned conservative arguments one by one.

General textile factories in Shanghai use old machines from the 1930s and 1940s, and there is an urgent need to update equipment. Currently, the Shanghai textile industry is carrying out technological transformation of old factories around production. Textile printing and dyeing factories are vigorously developing iron smelting, steelmaking, and sand casting equipment. In the second half of this year, they will manufacture approximately 2,900 various machine tools. In addition to supporting heavy industry, the rest will be used to equip themselves, so as to realize the first phase of the technological transformation plan for old factories in the next two years.

### 七十年陈规两月摧毁　十三道工序变成五道  上海纺织技术全部刷新

    七十年陈规两月摧毁　十三道工序变成五道
    上海纺织技术全部刷新
    新华社上海2日电　近七十年来在生产技术上很少变化的上海棉纺织工业，最近两个月来了一次飞跃，在好些方面迅速攀登世界纺织技术的高峰。
    拥有全国纱锭设备30％的上海棉纺织工业，技术革命在6月份进入一个新的阶段。职工们相互启发，相互促进，创造了高产量梳棉机、离心式和喷气式的高速运转细纱锭子、清花梳棉联合机、钢条粗联合机（梳棉、并条、粗纺三道工序合一）、用棉条直接纺细纱的七百倍至一千二百倍的超大牵伸精纺机、单程式经纱准备机，以及无纡、无梭织机等十多项世界纺织尖端技术。这些改革项目实现之后，职工们就可以丢开长期以来沿用的按照清花、梳棉、并条、粗纺、精纺、浆纱、织布等十三道工序渐进的生产方法，不用浆纱，不用纡子、梭子织布，只需五道工序就可以把棉花织成布。两个月来，职工们的每项创造，几乎都使生产跳跃发展，使产量成倍地提高，这在纺织工业史上是少有的。
    在两个月以前，上海纺织界还有不少人（主要是工程技术人员）认为：“要技术革命，最好的道路就是到外国去买新机器回来仿造。”也有人认为：“小的改进可以发动多数群众去搞，大的技术革命最好是把专家们组织起来去搞。”还有人认为：“命要革，但目前生产紧张，不能大搞，只能由少数人去搞，否则会打乱生产。”也有不少人在观潮、等待。
    有关领导部门依靠群众，批判了形形色色的保守思想，在党的总路线提出后，连续召开会议，提出了当前棉纺织工业技术革命的方向，即：车速高速化，工序单程化，生产连续化，设备自动化和产品高级、多样化等五个“化”。全行业职工经过整风运动，又受到总路线的鼓舞，思想觉悟提高，加上技术革命目标明确，于是大胆地想大胆地干，技术革命就势如破竹地开展起来。很多重要的发明创造，都是由工人或青年技术人员提出，集体合作在几天之内苦干出来的。这些事实把前述各种保守论调一一打破了。
    上海一般纺织工厂都是用的三、四十年前的老机器，迫切需要设备更新。目前上海纺织工业部门正在围绕生产，进行老厂技术改造。各纺织印染厂正在大搞炼铁、炼钢、翻砂设备，今年下半年要制造出约二千九百台各类机床，除以一部分支援重工业以外，其余都将用来装备自己，以便在今明两年内实现第一期老厂技术改造计划。
