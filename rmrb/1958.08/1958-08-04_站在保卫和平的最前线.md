Comrade Mao Zedong's recent talks with Comrade Khrushchev in Beijing are of great significance to the current struggle of people all over the world to defend peace and oppose aggression. In today's world, China and the Soviet Union, the two major countries with nearly one-third of the world's population, stand shoulder to shoulder, making joint efforts to defend peace, support national liberation movements, and oppose the imperialist policies of war and aggression. The close unity of the parties, governments, and peoples of these two countries has formed an invincible and decisive force. The meeting between the top leaders of China and the Soviet Union comprehensively discussed the urgent and major issues in the current international situation and decided to take further measures to strengthen the friendly alliance and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union and jointly strive for a peaceful solution to international problems and the maintenance of world peace. The communique of the talks has now been published. Undoubtedly, this is a serious blow to the imperialist aggressor forces and a new and great encouragement to the peace-loving people of all countries.

The meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union took place at a time of drastic changes in the international situation. On the one hand, the victory of the Iraqi people's struggle has greatly promoted the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the anti-imperialist struggle of people all over the world; on the other hand, the US and British imperialists are frantically carrying out armed intervention in the Middle East, greatly intensifying the international tension and the danger of a new war. At present, due to the strong protests and severe condemnation of China, the Soviet Union, other countries in the socialist camp, and all peace-loving countries and people, and due to the heroic resistance of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq, and other Arab countries, the adventurous behavior of the US and British aggressors has been defeated, and the struggle against aggression has achieved a great victory. However, the US and British aggressor troops have not yet rolled out of the Middle East, and are still seriously violating the independent rights of the Arab nation, meddling in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and threatening peace in the Middle East and the world. In other regions of Asia and in Africa and Latin America, the imperialist forces headed by the United States are also stepping up their conspiracies of subversion and sabotage, attempting to maintain and restore colonial rule. In response to the current international situation, the leaders of China and the Soviet Union fully exchanged views on a series of major issues facing the two countries in Asia and Europe, and reached a complete agreement on the measures to be taken to oppose aggression and maintain peace. The meeting between the top leaders of China and the Soviet Union fully reflects and satisfies the urgent demands of the people of the two countries, and also reflects the common demands of all peace-loving people.

What approach should be taken to the current international situation? The communique of the talks puts forward the consistent position of China and the Soviet Union in this regard, which is to immediately convene a summit conference of great powers to discuss the Middle East situation, and firmly demand that the United States and Britain immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan respectively. Countries should reach agreements on reducing armaments, stopping the testing and banning the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, abolishing all military blocs and all military bases set up in foreign countries, and concluding peace and collective security treaties. The communique reiterated that the right of the people of all countries to choose their own socio-political systems should be respected; countries with different social systems must practice peaceful coexistence in accordance with the Five Principles; all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiations; and economic and cultural ties between countries should be developed on the basis of mutual benefit and peaceful competition to enhance mutual understanding between the people of all countries. China and the Soviet Union expressed their firm support for the just struggles of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq, and other Arab countries, and their firm support for the national independence movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The communique pointed out that the national liberation movements are an irresistible trend, the colonial era is gone forever, and any attempt to maintain and restore colonial rule is a harm to the cause of peace and is doomed to failure. All of this is entirely in line with the aim of easing international tensions and maintaining peace, and is entirely in line with the common aspirations of China, the Soviet Union, other countries in the socialist camp, the Arab countries, other nationally independent countries, and all peace-loving people in the world.

To achieve this common goal and aspiration, we must wage a resolute and uncompromising struggle to smash all the despicable conspiracies of imperialism. At present, the attitude of the United States and Britain towards the issue of convening a summit conference of great powers is obviously lacking in sincerity. Under the unwavering attitude of the Soviet Union and the pressure of world public opinion, they have been forced to express their agreement to convene a summit conference of great powers. However, they have set up various reefs for the summit conference of great powers, and are doing their utmost to sabotage it. They are unwilling to withdraw their invading troops from the Middle East, and if they are eventually forced to withdraw their troops, they also want to use invading forces to seize new privileges, control a series of countries in the Middle East, and create some conditions favorable to them, so that they can find opportunities to re-expand aggression and launch new war adventures. The interests of US monopoly capital are constantly driving Eisenhower and Dulles to implement the so-called "brink of war" and "limited war" adventurous policies. Therefore, in order to ease international tensions and maintain peace, we must never rely solely on the good wishes and unilateral efforts of peace-loving countries and people. We uphold peace, but we are never afraid of imperialist war provocations, and we must have the full determination and confidence to thoroughly extinguish the flames of imperialist aggression. The communique of the talks wrote: "The aggressive blocs of the Western powers have so far refused to take any serious steps to maintain peace, but instead unscrupulously intensify international tensions, bringing mankind to the brink of war disaster. However, they should know that if the imperialist warmongers dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people will closely unite, thoroughly eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for lasting world peace." This is the firm and unwavering attitude of the people of China and the Soviet Union. Only by educating the people with this attitude can we arm the people's minds, can we achieve peace through struggle, and can we prevent some people from regarding efforts for peace as pacifism that paralyzes the people's will to fight, causing the people to feel panic in the face of tension, so that the enemies of peace have an opportunity to take advantage of.

In the struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, the Soviet Union is recognized by all the people of the world as a fortress of peace. Our People's Republic of China, from the day of its founding, has stood shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union on the forefront of the struggle for peace. The increasingly powerful development of China and the Soviet Union, the increasingly developing and consolidating friendly alliance and mutual assistance between the parties, governments, and peoples of the two countries, is undoubtedly a huge factor in maintaining peace. This meeting between the top leaders of China and the Soviet Union has further strengthened the friendly alliance and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union. Our people, who are constantly leaping forward on the road of socialist construction, will receive great encouragement from the results of this meeting between the top leaders of the two countries, will be more energetic, strive for the upper reaches, and develop production and construction undertakings more, faster, better, and more economically, so that our national economy, science, culture, and national defense strength will all leap to a higher level, making the strength of the entire socialist camp even stronger, and be able to more powerfully guarantee world peace. The communique of the talks pointed out: "The economies of both countries are developing rapidly. The strength of both countries is growing stronger. The unity and cooperation between the two countries, based on complete equality and comradely mutual assistance has a great vitality, and this unity and cooperation is not only conducive to the rapid advancement of the two countries along the socialist and communist roads, but also conducive to strengthening the strength of the entire socialist camp."

The reason why our two countries can unite closely and stand on the forefront of defending peace and opposing aggression, becoming loyal friends of the people of the world striving for peace and national independence, is because our two countries have the leadership of strong Communist Parties and are armed with the invincible thought of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, defending the internationalist unity between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and defending the principles of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries are our sacred tasks. The communique of the talks pointed out that the two parties will wage an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism, the main danger of the communist movement - a revisionism clearly manifested in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. We heartily congratulate the unbreakable fraternal unity between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and our Party based on Marxism-Leninism, and congratulate this unity for guiding our common cause from the great victories already achieved to even newer and greater victories.

    站在保卫和平的最前线
    毛泽东同志同赫鲁晓夫同志最近在北京举行的会谈，对于目前全世界人民保卫和平、反对侵略的斗争，具有伟大的意义。在今天的世界上，拥有全人类将近三分之一人口的中苏两大国肩并肩地站在一起，为保卫和平、支援民族解放运动、反对帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策进行共同的努力。这两个国家的党、政府和人民的紧密团结，已经形成了一支不可战胜的决定性力量。这次中苏两国最高领导人的会谈全面地讨论了目前国际形势中的迫切和重大的问题，决定采取进一步的措施，加强中苏两国的友好同盟互助关系，共同为争取和平解决国际问题、维护世界和平而奋斗。会谈的公报现在发表了。无疑地，这对于帝国主义侵略势力是一个严重的打击，对于世界各国爱好和平的人民是一个新的巨大鼓舞。
    中苏两国领导人的这一次会谈，是在国际形势发生激烈变化的时候举行的。在一方面，伊拉克人民斗争的胜利，大大推动了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动和全世界人民的反帝国主义斗争；在另一方面，美英帝国主义在中东地区疯狂地进行武装干涉，大大加剧了国际的紧张局势和新战争的危险。目前由于中苏两国和社会主义阵营其他各国及一切爱好和平的国家和人民的强烈抗议和严厉谴责，由于阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家的人民的英勇反抗，美英侵略者的冒险行为已经走向失败，反侵略的斗争已经取得巨大的胜利。但是，美英侵略军还没有滚出中东，仍然严重地侵犯着阿拉伯民族的独立权利，干涉着中东各国的内政，威胁着中东和世界的和平。在亚洲的其他地区和非洲、拉丁美洲各地，以美国为首的帝国主义势力也在加紧进行颠覆和破坏的阴谋，力图维持和恢复殖民统治。针对当前的国际形势，中苏两国领导人在会谈中就两国所面临的在亚洲方面和欧洲方面的一系列重大问题充分地交换了意见，并且对于反对侵略和维护和平所应采取的措施达成了完全一致的协议。中苏两国最高领导人的会谈充分地反映和满足了两国人民的迫切要求，同时也反映了一切爱好和平人民的共同要求。
    对于目前的国际形势应该采取什么方针呢？会谈公报在这一方面提出了中苏两国一致的主张，这就是要立即召开大国首脑会议，讨论中东局势，并且坚决要求美国和英国立即从黎巴嫩和约旦分别撤出他们的军队。各国应就裁减军备、停止试验和禁止使用原子武器和氢武器、取消一切军事集团和在外国设置的一切军事基地、缔结和平和集体安全公约，达成协议。会谈公报重申：各国人民选择自己的社会政治制度的权利应当得到尊重；不同社会制度的国家必须按照五项原则实行和平共处；一切国际争端应当通过和平谈判来解决；在互利及和平竞赛的基础上发展各国之间的经济和文化联系，增进各国人民之间的相互了解。中苏两国表示坚决支持阿拉伯联合共国和、伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动。会谈公报指出：民族解放运动是不可抗拒的潮流，殖民主义时代已经一去不复返了，任何维持和恢复殖民统治的企图都是对于和平事业的危害，都注定要失败。这一切完全符合于缓和国际紧张局势和维护和平的目的，完全符合于中国、苏联、社会主义阵营的其他各国、阿拉伯各国、其他民族独立的国家和世界上一切爱好和平人民的共同愿望。
    为了实现这个共同的目的和愿望，我们必须进行坚决的毫不妥协的斗争，粉碎帝国主义的一切卑鄙阴谋。目前在召开大国首脑会议的问题上，美国和英国的态度是显然缺乏诚意的。他们在苏联的坚定不移的态度和世界舆论的压力下，不能不被迫表示同意召开大国首脑会议。但是，他们为大国首脑会议设置了种种暗礁，极力加以破坏。他们不愿意从中东地区撤退侵略的军队，而如果最终被迫撤兵，他们也想利用侵略武力攫取新的特权，控制中东一系列国家，造成某种对他们有利的条件，以便他们寻找机会，重新扩大侵略和发动新的战争冒险。美国垄断资本的利益正不断地驱使艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯实行所谓“战争边缘”和“有限战争”的冒险政策。因此，为了缓和国际紧张局势和维护和平，决不能仅仅依靠爱护和平的国家和人民的善良愿望和单方面的努力。我们坚持和平，但是我们决不害怕帝国主义的战争挑衅，而必须有彻底扑灭帝国主义侵略战火的充分决心和信心。会谈公报写道：“西方大国的侵略集团至今拒绝对于维护和平采取任何认真的步骤，反而肆无忌惮地加剧国际紧张局势，使人类濒于战争灾难的边缘。但是，他们应当知道，如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末，所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”这就是中苏两国人民坚定不移的态度。只有用这种态度教育人民，才能使人民的精神武装起来，才能用斗争取得和平，而不致使某些人把为和平的努力当作麻痹人民斗争意志的和平主义，使人民在紧张局势面前感觉恐慌，从而使和平的敌人有隙可乘。
    在反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的斗争中，苏联是全世界人民公认的和平堡垒。我们中华人民共和国从成立的那一天起，就同苏联并肩站在为和平而斗争的最前线。中苏两国力量日益强大的发展，两国的党、政府和人民的友好同盟互助关系的日益发展和巩固，无疑地是维护和平的巨大因素。中苏两国最高领导人的这一次会谈使中苏两国友好同盟互助关系有了进一步的加强。在社会主义建设的道路上不断跃进的我国人民，从这一次两国最高领导人会谈的成果中将得到巨大的鼓舞，将更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，更多更快更好更省地发展生产和建设事业，使我国国民经济、科学文化和国防力量都跃进到更高的水平，使整个社会主义阵营的力量更加增强，能够更有力地保障世界的和平。会谈公报指出：“两国的经济都在飞跃发展。两国的力量日益强大。两国建立在完全平等和同志般互助的基础上的团结和合作具有伟大的生命力，这种团结和合作不仅有利于两国沿着社会主义和共产主义道路迅速前进，而且有利于加强整个社会主义阵营的力量。”
    我们两国之所以能够紧密地团结一致，站在保卫和平、反对侵略的最前线，成为全世界争取和平和民族独立的人民的忠实朋友，是因为我们两国都有强大的共产党的领导，都有战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的思想武装。因此，捍卫中国共产党和苏联共产党之间的国际主义团结，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁，捍卫各国共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言的原则，是我们的神圣任务。会谈公报指出，两党将同共产主义运动的主要危险修正主义——这种修正主义明显地表现在南斯拉夫共产主义联盟的纲领中——进行毫不调和的斗争。我们衷心地祝贺苏联共产党和我们的党之间的建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的不可动摇的兄弟团结，祝贺这个团结引导我们的共同事业从现在已经取得的伟大胜利走向更加新的伟大胜利。
