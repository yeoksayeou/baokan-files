Xinhua News Agency, 6th August: The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles today convened a symposium on the "Communique of the Talks between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev." More than fifty people participated in the symposium, including famous writers and artists such as Mao Dun, Lao She, Zheng Zhenduo, Ye Shengtao, Cai Chusheng, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Yang Hansheng, Bing Xin, Zhou Libo, Zhao Shuli, Ma Sicong, Lü Ji, Qu Xixian, Wu Zuoren, Liu Kaiqu, and Cao Jinghua.

In their speeches, everyone unanimously expressed their support for the Communique of the Talks between Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev with incomparable excitement, believing that this communique is a major event determining the fate of mankind. It represents the firm will and determination of the people of China and the Soviet Union to defend peace and prevent war, and the urgent desire of peace-loving people all over the world. It demonstrates the unbreakable great unity between China and the Soviet Union, and is the most powerful weapon for defending world peace, giving a head-on blow to the American and British imperialists who are creating wars in the Middle East. Everyone believed that, to further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, it is necessary to wage an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism. Mao Dun, Vice-Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said: The communique of the talks between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union is a serious blow to imperialism and a powerful support to the anti-colonialist people in the Middle East and the world. Lao She said: This communique is a major event in history. We must accelerate peaceful construction, but also be vigilant at all times. If imperialism goes mad, we will resolutely and thoroughly eliminate it. Zheng Zhenduo said: This communique makes the people of the whole country and the whole world excited and throws imperialism into a panic. Ouyang Yuqian said: This communique is a symbol of the further strengthening of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Bing Xin said: This communique is a "reassurance" for the peace-loving people and is equivalent to an "intercontinental missile" for imperialism. Tian Han said: Through many recent specific struggles internationally, the face of Yugoslav revisionism has been exposed more clearly. It is necessary to thoroughly criticize revisionism and further consolidate the unity of the socialist camp. Cao Jinghua said: This communique has become a great driving force for our country's socialist construction, and we will leave American and British imperialism far behind.

In their speeches, everyone also actively expressed their determination to use various literary and artistic weapons to defend peace, oppose war, and promote the spirit of the Sino-Soviet talks communique. The vanguards of the literary and art circles—the artists participating in the National Folk Art Performance—have created more than fifty new works within three days of the publication of the communique, practiced singing all night, and have all gone to the streets today to carry out propaganda. More than thirty painters in the art world are actively creating propaganda posters and murals, and more than a dozen propaganda posters have been sent to press. The workers are guaranteed to rush to print them overnight within three days. The China Youth Art Theater recited Guo Moruo's poem "Cheering for the Sino-Soviet Talks Communique!" before the performance of "Thirteen Mausoleums Reservoir Capriccio", giving the audience great encouragement. Playwright Tian Han said that he would write a grand play to defend peace and oppose war. Composer Qu Xixian sang the lyrics she had just composed on the spot, "A Red Light Illuminates the Sky" and "Billions of People are Happy," and poet Yuan Shuipai recited the poem he wrote on the spot, "The Sino-Soviet Communique is the Biggest Satellite." Musician Ma Sicong said that he would create various forms of music such as chorus and songs to enhance the strength of peace. Writers and artists have expressed their willingness to create more works that defend peace, stop war, praise Sino-Soviet friendship, and oppose revisionism, and enthusiastically expressed their determination to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda through various artistic collaborations, and contribute greater strength to defending peace.

    新华社6日讯  中国文学艺术界联合会今天召开了关于“毛泽东和赫鲁晓夫会谈公报”的座谈会。参加座谈会的有著名文学家艺术家茅盾、老舍、郑振铎、叶圣陶、蔡楚生、田汉、欧阳予倩、阳翰笙、冰心、周立波、赵树理、马思聪、吕骥、瞿希贤、吴作人、刘开渠、曹靖华等五十多人。
    大家在发言中，以无比兴奋心情一致表示拥护毛泽东主席和赫鲁晓夫同志会谈公报，认为这一公报是决定人类命运的大事，它代表了中苏两国人民保卫和平制止战争的坚强意志和决心，代表着全世界爱好和平人民的迫切愿望；它显示了中苏两国牢不可破的伟大团结，是保卫世界和平最有力的武器，给予在中东制造战争的美英帝国主义者以迎头痛击。大家认为：要进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结，必须与修正主义作不调和的斗争。中国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾说：中苏两国领袖的会谈公报是对帝国主义的严重打击，是对中东及全世界反殖民主义人民的有力支持。老舍说：这一公报是历史上的重大事件。我们要加速进行和平建设，但也要随时警惕，假如帝国主义发疯发狂，我们就坚决彻底消灭它。郑振铎说：这一公报使全国全世界人心振奋，使帝国主义惊慌失措。欧阳予倩说：这一公报是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加壮大的象征。冰心说：这一公报对和平人民是个“定心丸”，对帝国主义等于是“洲际导弹”。田汉说：通过国际上最近的许多具体斗争，南斯拉夫修正主义的面貌暴露得更加明显了，必须彻底批判修正主义，进一步巩固社会主义阵营的团结。曹靖华说：这一公报对我国社会主义建设成为很大的推动力量，我们会把美英帝国主义远远抛到后面去。
    大家在发言中还积极表示要运用各种文艺武器来保卫和平、反对战争、宣扬中苏会谈公报的精神。文艺界的尖兵——参加全国曲艺会演的艺人们在公报发表后的三天内已创作了五十多篇新作品，通宵练唱，今天已全部出动到街头去进行宣传。美术界已有三十多位画家在积极创作宣传画和壁画，已有十几张宣传画付印，工人们保证连夜突击在三天内印出来。中国青年艺术剧院在演出“十三陵水库畅想曲”的幕前朗诵了郭沫若的诗作“为中苏会谈公报欢呼！”给予观众极大的鼓舞。剧作家田汉表示要写一个维护和平反对战争的大戏。作曲家瞿希贤在座谈会上当场唱起她刚谱成的曲词“一道红光照满天”和“亿万人民高兴”，诗人袁水拍诵读了自己当场即兴写出的诗“中苏公报是最大的卫星”。音乐家马思聪表示要创作大合唱、歌曲等各种形式的音乐来增强和平力量。文学家、艺术家们都表示要多多创作维护和平、制止战争，歌颂中苏友好及反对修正主义的作品，并热烈地表示要用各种艺术互相协作的方式进行广泛深入的宣传，为保卫和平贡献更大的力量。
