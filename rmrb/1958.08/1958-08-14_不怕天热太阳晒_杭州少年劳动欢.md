　  Not Afraid of the Heat or Sun, Hangzhou Youths Labor Joyfully
    (Our dispatch) This summer vacation, over 75,000 Young Pioneers in Hangzhou City, focusing on labor production and public service labor, have carried out meaningful summer activities such as cutting grass, accumulating fertilizer, and participating in summer camps.
    Starting from June 30th, the city's Young Pioneers launched a vigorous "Red Scarf a Load of Grass, Support the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture" grass-cutting and fertilizer-accumulation campaign. In the early morning, while people were still asleep, the members had already dispersed to places like Mount Mituo to cut grass. Although the weather was very hot, the Young Pioneers put forward the battle cry of "Not afraid of the heat or the sun, we will fill our baskets with green grass." Those without sickles used scissors, and those without tools used their hands to pull the grass. They have already cut over seven million jin of green grass.
    This summer vacation, the city will host more than twenty district and team summer camps. The labor summer camp held in the Xiacheng District is linked to the Dongqing Township agricultural cooperative. Children participating in the summer camp go to the agricultural cooperative for two hours of labor every morning. (Huang Keping)

　  不怕天热太阳晒  杭州少年劳动欢
    本报讯　今年暑期，杭州市七万五千多个少先队员，以劳动生产、公益劳动为中心，开展了割草、积肥，参加夏令营等有意义的暑期活动。
    从6月30日起，全市少先队员开展了轰轰烈烈的“红领巾一担草，支援农业大跃进”的割草积肥活动。早晨，当人们还在熟睡之中，队员们已分头在弥陀山等地割草了。虽然天气很热，少先队员们提出了“不怕天热太阳晒，定把青草割满篮”的战斗口号。没有镰刀就用剪刀剪，没有工具的人就用手拔。他们已割了七百多万斤青草。
    今年暑假全市要举办二十多个区和队部的夏令营。下城区举办的劳动夏令营，和东清乡农业社挂上钩，参加夏令营的儿童，每天上午到农业社去劳动二小时。（黄客萍）
