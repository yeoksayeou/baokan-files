Song of Guatemala
Cuba Ni Guillén
[Editor's Note] Nicolás Guillén is a famous Cuban and Latin American poet. He visited China in 1952. Between June and July 1954, the United States, through armed invasion and violent coups, overthrew the democratic government of Guatemala headed by Arbenz. Guillén was visiting Guatemala at the time. This poem describes his sadness and confidence when he left Guatemala.
	The plane carrying me,
	Takes off from Guatemala,
	The propeller is sobbing,
	The motor is sighing:
	Guatemala,
	How unlucky I am,
	How unlucky, how unlucky,
	To leave you today!
	But I tell the plane:
	--The last bullet has not yet been fired,
	I will be back.
	Along with the plane,
	The imperial vulture is also flying,
	It spreads its heavy wings,
	Enveloping the land and the sea.
	Don't think it's high-spirited today,
	Tomorrow you won't see it flying.
	The plane carrying me,
	Met a pile of clouds on the road,
	I saw heavy tears condensed on the clouds,
	Weighing it down so it couldn't move.
	It said, Guatemala,
	How unlucky I am,
	Alas, Guatemala, I love you,
	But now I have to leave you!
	But it heard me answer:
	--Death has not yet won,
	We must return.
	Along with the plane,
	The imperial vulture is also flying,
	Feathers as heavy as lead, claws outstretched,
	Wanting to grab and plunder.
	Don't think it's looting and plundering today,
	Tomorrow you won't see it stealing.
	My plane flies high in the sky,
	Flying past the side of a star;
	It doesn't move, shining in the sky,
	I heard it say:
	Guatemala,
	I see you lying in the street,
	With bloodstains on your chest, a broken wing,
	Struggling between life and death!
	But I immediately replied:
	Pure, bright star,
	Wait for me to return to Guatemala!
	Along with the plane,
	The imperial vulture is also flying,
	Eyes like cold stones,
	Beak like a bloody dagger.
	Don't think it's killing and arson today,
	Tomorrow you won't see it showing off.

    危地马拉之歌
    古巴　尼·纪廉
    〔编者附记〕　尼古拉斯·纪廉，是古巴和拉丁美洲的著名诗人。1952年曾来中国访问。1954年6—7月间，美国通过武装侵略和暴力政变，推翻了危地马拉的阿本斯民主政府。当时纪廉正在危地马拉访问。这首诗描写他离开危地马拉时所感到的悲愤和信心。
    载着我的飞机，
    从危地马拉起飞，
    螺旋桨在呜咽，
    马达在叹息：
    危地马拉啊，
    我多么倒楣，
    多么倒楣，多么倒楣，
    今天就要跟你离别！
    但是我告诉飞机：
    ——最后一颗子弹还未出膛，
    我还要回来。
    跟着飞机一道，
    帝国的秃鹰也在飞翔，
    它展开了沉重的翅膀，
    笼罩着大地和海洋。
    别看它今天趾高气扬，
    明天你就看不见它飞翔。
    载着我的飞机，
    路上遇到了一堆云雾，
    我看见云雾上凝聚着沉重的泪珠，
    把它压得不能动弹。
    它说，危地马拉啊，
    我多么倒楣，
    唉，危地马拉啊，我爱你，
    现在却要和你离别！
    但是它听到了我回答：
    ——死神还没有得胜，
    我们一定要回来。
    跟着飞机一道，
    帝国的秃鹰也在飞翔，
    羽毛像铅一样沉重，钩爪伸张，
    要抓要抢。
    别看它今天抢劫虏掠，
    明天你就看不见它偷抢。
    我的飞机高高飞在天上，
    飞过一颗星儿的身旁；
    它一动也不动，在天空闪着光芒，
    我听见它说：
    危地马拉啊，
    我看见你躺在街上，
    胸前血迹斑斑，折断了一只翅膀，
    正在生与死之间挣扎！
    但是我马上回答说：
    纯洁的，灿烂的星儿啊，
    在危地马拉等我回来吧！
    跟着飞机一道，
    帝国的秃鹰也在飞翔，
    眼睛像冷酷的石头，
    尖嘴像带血的匕首。
    别看它今天杀人放火，
    明天你就看不见它逞强。
              （陈用仪译）
