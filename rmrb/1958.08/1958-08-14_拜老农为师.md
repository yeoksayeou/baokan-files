　　Taking Old Peasants as Teachers
　　Xiao Min
    “If the classroom doesn't work, go to the fields to see.” This is an important lesson learned from many mass-run agricultural technical schools that combines teaching with practical production and learning with doing. Many technical problems in agricultural production that are not easily understood in the classroom and are difficult for students to grasp can be easily understood by letting students go to the fields to see how farmers actually operate. It is clear that practical production is the teacher, and farmers are also teachers.
    This experience, summarized by the masses, reveals the fundamental principle of teaching and is of great benefit to breaking down superstitions in running schools and greatly developing agricultural technical schools. Learn what you do, and teach what agricultural production needs; teachers are not limited to one type, people with a certain level of cultural and technical skills can be teachers, and old peasants can also be teachers. If students don't understand something, they can go to see and do it, and even if the teachers don't understand it, they can discuss it with everyone, pool their wisdom, and solve it together. In this way, agricultural cooperatives can run agricultural technical schools, and farms can run agricultural technical schools even more. Generally speaking, farms have some agricultural technicians and farmers with rich practical production experience, and they can all teach a certain aspect of agricultural technology or guide students in practical operations. This is how the Dongjiawan Farm in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, established an agricultural technical school. They "run the farm and run the school, use the farm to support the school, and use the school to expand the farm," so that production and education, developing production and cultivating technical forces, serve each other and promote each other.
    Some people may ask: Can old peasants be teachers? The answer is yes. Agricultural technology and science come from production, from practice, and are summarized from the production activities of predecessors and today's working people. There is no mystery. Today, China's farmers have created unprecedentedly high yields in agricultural production, with 36,900 catties per mu of early rice, more than 7,000 catties per mu of wheat, and more than 10,000 catties per mu of peanuts, etc. This is a living textbook. Agricultural production can have such high yields because it has its objective laws. As long as these objective laws are found and summarized and improved, it is knowledge, it is science. Since farmers have created new records of high yields and have rich practical production experience, why can't they teach a certain aspect of agricultural technology? It is certain that they can, and there are already such precedents. Wasn't Ning Huatang, an old shepherd from Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, hired as a professor in the animal husbandry teaching and research group of the Shanxi Agricultural College, and didn't he go to the university to talk about his knowledge of raising ewes to produce twins? Aren't some of the teachers in the Dongjiawan Farm Agricultural Technical School employed from farmers who raise livestock, graft trees, grow rice, and grow watermelons? In this regard, we must also break down superstitions and break with conventions. Don't think that only students who have graduated from certain schools and only people with book knowledge can be teachers. Of course, some farmers lack theoretical knowledge of agriculture and cannot raise practical production experience to the height of theory to teach it. This is a defect. However, the Dongjiawan Farm Agricultural Technical School has created a very good experience, which is to combine teachers who only have book knowledge but no practical production knowledge with those who have practical production experience but no book knowledge, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, enrich teaching content, and do a good job in teaching. This experience is very beneficial for places that lack teachers in running agricultural technical schools.

    “课堂不通，田间去看”。这是许多群众办的农业技术学校教学联系生产实际，学和做相结合的一条重要经验。许多在课堂上不易弄清楚，学生不易听懂的农业生产上的技术问题，让学生到田间去看看，看农民实际操作一番，问题很容易地弄懂了。可见生产实际就是老师，农民也是老师。
    群众总结的这条经验，一语道破了教学的根本原则，而对于破除办学的迷信，大办农业技术学校大有好处。做什么学什么，农业生产需要什么就教什么；教师不拘一格，具有一定文化技术水平的人能当教师，老农也能当教师，学生弄不懂的去看、去做，甚至连教师也弄不懂的就交给大家去讨论，集思广益，大家解决。这样一来，农业社能办农业技术学校了，农场更可以办农业技术学校了。一般说来，农场有些农业技术人员和富有实际生产经验的农民，他们都可以担任某一方面的农业技术课或指导学生实际操作。湖南邵东县董家湾农场就是这样办起了一所农业技术学校，他们以“办场办学，以场养校，以校扩场”，生产和教育，发展生产和培养技术力量，相互为用，相互促进。
    有人可能会问：老农当教师行吗？答复是肯定的。农业技术科学来自生产，来自实践，是前人和今天劳动人民的生产活动中总结出来的，没有什么奥妙。今天，我国的农民在农业生产上创造了古今中外史无前例的高额产量，有亩产三万六千九百多斤的早稻，亩产七千多斤的小麦，亩产一万多斤的花生，等等。这就是一部活的教科书。农业生产能有这样高的产量，其中有它的客观规律，只要把这些客观规律找出来，加以总结提高，就是学问，就是科学。农民既然创造了高额产量的新纪录，有丰富的实际生产经验，他们为什么不能讲某方面的农业技术课呢？肯定地说是一定能的，而且也已有了这样的先例。山西陵川县老羊工宁华堂不是被聘为山西农学院畜牧系家畜教研组的教授，不是登上大学的讲台去讲他培育母羊产双胎的学问吗？董家湾农场农业技术学校有些教师不是由饲养员、嫁接员、种水稻和种西瓜的农民担任的吗？在这方面也要破除迷信，打破常规，不要以为只有什么什么学校毕业的学生，只有书本知识的人才能做教师。当然，有的农民是缺乏农业理论知识的，不可能把实际生产经验提高到理论的高度去讲，这是个缺陷。但是，董家湾农场农业技术学校却创造了一个很好的经验，就是把只有书本知识而无实际生产知识，把有实际生产经验而无书本知识的教师结合起来，彼此取长补短，丰富教学内容，把教学工作搞好。这条经验，对于创办农业技术学校而缺乏师资的地方是颇为有益的。
