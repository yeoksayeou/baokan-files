The socialist revolution in our country has basically achieved victory economically, politically, and ideologically. Socialist relations of production have been established, productive forces have been liberated, and production levels have greatly increased. However, due to China's economic backwardness, the material foundation of the socialist system is not yet strong enough. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, proposed that the whole Party must lead the people of the country to gradually realize the technological revolution and the cultural revolution whilecontinuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. The purpose of this revolution is to establish a strong material and technical foundation in our country and fundamentally change the face of our country.

After more than eight years of efforts since liberation, the level of production technology in our country has greatly improved. The completion of a series of modern industrial enterprises with the 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union as the backbone has created material and technical conditions for future technological revolutions. However, compared with the technologically advanced countries in the world, our country is still backward in this respect. Generally speaking, our national production has not yet undergone the large-scale mechanization and electrification technological transformation that those countries have experienced. Now there is a new trend of more advanced technological transformation in the world. Therefore, the task before the people of our country is to adopt various methods, including making the most of the latest scientific and technological achievements, to complete the mechanization and electrification of our country, and to equip some important industrial sectors with the latest technology.

As Comrade Mao Zedong said, China's "poverty and blankness" seems to be a bad thing, but it is actually a good thing. It is precisely because of poverty that the vast masses of our country have an urgent demand to reform production technology, and their enthusiasm for carrying out the technological revolution is very high. It is precisely because of blankness that we can be free from the shackles of old things, freely and fully utilize the latest scientific and technological achievements in the world, more effectively and rationally develop and utilize our resources, and arrange our production to achieve overtaking. For example, the industrial backbone that the Soviet Union helped China build has adopted the latest technology. The Three Gorges Hydropower Project that we are preparing to build is the largest and most complex water conservancy project in the world and will become the largest hydroelectric power station in the world. China's resources are very rich, and less has been exploited. This is where we are superior to advanced capitalist countries; we should give full play to this favorable condition and make the most rational use of these infinitely rich resources.

Realizing the technological revolution and the cultural revolution is the current historical task of the entire Party and the entire people. Among them, scientific and technological work occupies a very important position.

The Party Central Committee has always attached great importance to scientific and technological research. At the conference on intellectual issues convened by the Central Committee in early 1956, the call to "march towards science" was issued, and it was required that the most important scientific and technological departments in our country catch up with or approach the advanced world level within twelve years. Over the past two years, we have formulated a long-term plan for the development of science and technology. Although China's scientific undertakings have made greater progress, they are far from meeting the requirements of the current technological revolution. In the past, not enough attention was paid to the development of local scientific and technological research, the technological innovation of the masses, and the improvement of tools. In March of this year, the Chengdu Conference convened by the Central Committee put forward the opinion of establishing scientific research institutions in various provinces, autonomous regions, special districts, and counties with conditions, which played an important role in promoting the entire Party's grasp of science and technology. Since then, scientific undertakings in various places have begun to develop rapidly, and some townships and communities have also started scientific research work according to their own needs.

In the technological revolution and cultural revolution movement, the main task of scientific and technological work is to study and solve the urgent problems raised in industrial and agricultural production and construction, and to serve the leap forward in production. Theoretical and long-term scientific research work is also an aspect that cannot be ignored. In scientific and technological work, we must oppose the tendency to be divorced from reality, but we must also look further ahead and not go into a narrow circle, so as to hinder the further development of science and technology.

Sufficient attention must be paid to the scientific and technological creations and inventions of the masses, and they must be actively summarized, improved, and promoted. The inventions and creations of the masses in production practice are an important source of scientific and technological development, and they should be improved on the basis of popularization, and popularization should be carried out under the guidance of improvement. We must never allow those beneficial inventions and creations and advanced experiences to disappear like a flash in the pan due to a lack of scientific and technological support. Saplings cannot exist for a long time; either they develop and grow, or they wither and die. We must give full play to the wisdom of the masses with the greatest enthusiasm, so that the mass technological innovation movement will continue to push towards new peaks.

Since the winter and spring of last year, a vigorous mass movement of improving tools and innovating technology has been launched throughout the country. This movement is of extremely important significance for realizing the technological revolution in our country. But even now, some people still think that this kind of tool improvement and technological innovation is a low-level thing from the perspective of modern science and technology and is nothing remarkable. They do not understand that it is countless such "unremarkable" creations and inventions that can increase labor productivity several times or dozens of times, preparing conditions for transferring all national production departments to the basis of modern large-scale production economically and technically. The full play of the masses' initiative and creativity enables our country to build our country into a socialist state with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at a leaping speed. This kind of vigorous mass movement can only be achieved in socialist countries, but is unimaginable in capitalist countries. This is a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system and a manifestation of the great liberation of the communist ideas of the broad masses of working people. It should be seen that the mass movement of improving tools and innovating technology itself has great revolutionary significance.

Widespread mass movements of tool improvement and technological innovation do not mean that the adoption of the latest science and technology can be ignored. Some people think that adopting new technologies in industry and agriculture costs a lot of money and is difficult to master, so they are not so enthusiastic about this matter. In fact, any new technology can emerge, gain a foothold, and replace the old technology because it has its economic or operational advantages. When conditions are met, adopting new technologies can achieve the goals of more, faster, better, and more economical. For example, polymer compounds can be used to manufacture products originally made of metal and animal and plant fibers, which is a new technology developed in the past two decades. Developing the polymer compound industry can open up abundant sources of materials for manufacturing various machines and supplies, and can solve many production and consumption needs more, faster, better, and more economically. For example, the production of antibiotics, which developed during World War II, is not only of great value in medicine, but also of great value in agriculture and animal husbandry. As for mastering the production technology of polymer compounds and antibiotics, according to domestic experience in recent years, it is not a particularly difficult matter and is also economically cost-effective.

We must concentrate our efforts and intensify research on the latest departments of modern scientific and technological development. We should and can completely master atomic fission and thermonuclear reactions in a not-too-long period of time, utilize the latest technology of atomic energy in all aspects, master the latest technology of radio and electronics, master the latest technology of jet propulsion, rockets, and even conquering outer space, master the manufacture of high-strength metallic and non-metallic materials with high pressure resistance, high temperature resistance, and strong radioactive radiation resistance, master the new technology of manufacturing high-efficiency liquid and solid fuels, and master the latest technology of manufacturing precision machinery and automated machinery. We should strive to develop our country's industrial and agricultural production, improve the living standards of our people, and rapidly strengthen our strength to defend the motherland and defend peace on the basis of these scientific and technological research achievements. Obviously, there are difficulties on our road, but as long as we despise these difficulties strategically and value these difficulties tactically, work hard, study diligently, and work conscientiously, then the glorious task before us will surely be completed.

The socialist Great Leap Forward is a comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and scientific and technological research work must also have a Great Leap Forward. The research of practical problems must leap forward, and the research of theoretical problems must also leap forward; the research of current production problems must leap forward, and the research of long-term construction problems must also leap forward. Of course, for various research institutions and different regions, we must still proceed in a focused and step-by-step manner according to specific circumstances.

In order to realize the comprehensive leap forward of scientific and technological research work, the entire Party must grasp scientific and technological work and lead the research of science and technology from a narrow scope to a broad world. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the research institutions of various central departments should be responsible for the research of relatively important, critical, and nationally significant issues in production; the research institutions of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should conduct research closely in line with the actual needs of local production; the research institutions of special districts and counties should bear relatively preliminary research; this is only a rough division, and in fact, some places can and will inevitably bear national research tasks, and some research institutions directly led by various central departments must also bear some research tasks proposed by the locality. As for popularization and promotion work, organizations at all levels have certain responsibilities.

It must be especially pointed out here that the research strength of higher education institutions has not yet been fully utilized. After the reform of the education system and the decentralization of a large number of higher education institutions to local leadership, various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should give them research tasks and appropriately arrange their research work under the condition of taking into account both teaching and research.

In order to do a good job in scientific and technological undertakings, it is necessary to solve several ideological problems.

First, we must oppose the idea of dependence. In the past eight years, in the field of science and technology, as in other fields, the great Soviet Union and other fraternal countries have given our country huge and generous assistance, which the people of our country deeply appreciate. In the future, we will still need the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union. However, some people think that as long as there is the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, we do not have to conduct more difficult research ourselves. This idea is incorrect. Learning from the Soviet Union and mastering the advanced scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and other countries is the way for the rapid development of science and technology in our country, which is beyond doubt. But this does not mean that we can adopt a dependent attitude of not working hard ourselves. This erroneous attitude is not only harmful to the development of science and technology in our country, but also detrimental to the development of science and technology in the entire socialist camp. Moreover, due to the characteristics of China's natural conditions and construction work, it is in fact impossible to completely copy the existing experiences of other countries. This is the case in geology, meteorology, and mining work, as well as in agriculture, industry, and medical and health undertakings. Many studies combined with China's characteristics can not only solve problems for China's production and construction, but also add a share of property to the world's scientific treasure house.

Second, we must oppose feelings of inferiority. Some people think that the level of science and technology in our country is too low and cannot solve any problems; we do not need to or should not even study the problems that Western countries have not solved. They do not believe in their own scientific and technological personnel, do not believe in the creations of workers and peasants, and do not believe in China's rich historical heritage. Although many technical problems can be solved or have already been solved in our country, some people still ask fraternal countries to conduct research and design, which not only increases unnecessary burdens on fraternal countries, but also hinders the growth of China's scientific and technological strength. We must humbly learn from the advanced experience of foreign countries, and there should be no wavering on this point. However, we should never lose the due confidence of the nation because of this. Lack of national self-confidence is lack of trust in the creativity of 600 million people. Taking a bureaucratic attitude towards the creative labor of the masses and the growth of new forces is absolutely not allowed by the interests of the people's cause.

Third, we must break superstitions and oppose the view of "mystifying" science. The Party Central Committee has called on us to break superstitions, which is of great significance for the development of science and technology in our country. The idea of being afraid of scientists and professors and not daring to lead scientific and technological work should be completely changed. Of course, scientific and technological research involves a lot of specialized knowledge, and the attitude of pretending to know when one does not know must be opposed; but as long as the direction is correct, the method is right, relying on the masses, studying diligently, and working conscientiously, the Party can completely lead scientific and technological work, and doubt and wavering on this issue is completely wrong. In fact, many party-member leading cadres in industrial and agricultural production departments and many regions are beginning to become experts in their fields through practical training and systematic learning. Party-member leading comrades of some scientific research institutions, after several years of studying their professions, not only can provide leadership in political ideology, but also have a certain say in business work. The view of mystifying science has no basis.

In order to develop science and technology in our country, we must rapidly consolidate, train, and expand our scientific and technological ranks.

Now our scientific and technological ranks are still small, the arms are not complete, and our struggle with bourgeois scientists on the two roads has not been completely resolved. In order to solve this problem, first of all, we must continue to carry out ideological transformation of existing scientific and technological personnel. During the rectification movement, China's intellectual circles launched a self-transformation movement. This movement was more profound and more extensive in educating and transforming intellectuals than previous movements. Big-character posters and big debates made mass appraisals of many scientific and technological personnel. The movement revealed that some people's bourgeois ideas were very serious. For example, for personal fame and fortune, they are unwilling to study the problems that urgently need to be solved in national construction, but are diligently engaged in drilling into dead ends; they engage in speculation and plagiarism of other people's research results; they stick to conventions and reject new things; they regard themselves as authorities and suppress new forces; they oppose necessary collective research; they are divorced from production and the tendency to be divorced from reality; and so on. Their erroneous ideas have a great influence on the younger generation and are a great obstacle to the development of scientific undertakings. We must grasp the link of ideological transformation and achieve a thorough victory in the socialist revolution on the ideological front. We must educate scientific workers to strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, diligently study scientific and technological business, approach the masses, face production, combine with China's actual needs to carry out research work, and wholeheartedly serve socialist construction, and become scientific workers who are both red and expert with high revolutionary enthusiasm and rich scientific knowledge.

Secondly, it is necessary to accelerate the training of new forces, which is the main way to establish China's scientific and technological ranks. In addition to the general training in schools, the following methods should also be noted: (1) Improve the training system and training methods for on-the-job cadres and graduate students. Expand the number of students sent to study abroad. (2) Open new types of universities, select outstanding high school graduates, and give them relatively strict training in science and technology. In the third and fourth grades of university, students will intern in relevant research institutions or participate in some research work. This can accelerate the growth of new scientific forces, especially for those emerging disciplines and departments that require more equipment. (3) Train and establish the technical team of scientific research institutions, including technicians and technicians. (4) Train scientific and technological backbones from workers and peasants. Many workers, peasants, trainees, technicians and other young people have made outstanding achievements in technology in this Great Leap Forward. They should be encouraged and helped to continue their research and given opportunities for further study in a planned way. (5) Vigorously carry out scientific popularization work, train millions of primary industrial and agricultural scientific and technological talents, and make them the backbone of popularizing scientific knowledge and promoting new technologies in industrial and mining rural areas. (6) Organize cadres to study technology and learn science, and learn the ability to lead scientific and technological work. Drawing out some excellent on-the-job cadres for short-term training and expanding the scientific and technological ranks is necessary for the long-term interests of scientific and technological undertakings, and it is also permitted by the current realistic conditions of cadres in our country.

After a year of rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, the Party's leadership over scientific undertakings has definitely been strengthened. The scientific community has not only made significant progress in political ideology during this period, but also has had a greater transformation in scientific research work through the debate on the two roads and two methods. The characteristics of the current situation are that the mass movement of technological innovation is developing, and the vast scientific and technological circles are still leaping forward ideologically and in their work on the basis of the rectification movement. As long as our entire Party strives to grasp scientific and technological work and strengthen the leadership of this front, the twelve-year scientific and technological long-term plan will surely be realized, and the task of catching up with the advanced world scientific and technological level will surely be completed in a relatively short period of time.

    全党抓科学技术工作，实现技术革命
    国务院副总理兼科学规划委员会主任　聂荣臻
    我国社会主义革命在经济上、政治上和思想上已经基本上取得了胜利。社会主义的生产关系已经建立起来，生产力得到了解放，生产水平大大提高了。但是，由于我国经济落后，社会主义制度的物质基础还不够强大。刘少奇同志在“八大”第二次会议上报告中提出，全党必须领导全国人民在继续完成经济战线、政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命。这个革命的目的就是要在我国建立起强大的物质技术基础，从根本上改变我国的面貌。
    我国的生产技术水平，经过解放后八年多来的努力，已经有了很大的提高。以苏联援助我国建设的一百五十六项工程为骨干的一系列近代工业企业的建成，为今后的技术革命创造了物质技术条件。但是，与世界上生产技术先进的国家比较起来，我国在这一方面还是落后的。一般说来，我们全国的生产还没有经过那些国家所经历的那种大规模的机械化、电气化的技术改造。现在世界上又出现了更先进的技术改造的新趋势。因此，摆在我国人民面前的任务是：要采取各种各样的办法，其中包括尽可能地利用最新的科学技术成就，来完成我国的机械化、电气化，并且在一些重要的工业部门用最新的技术装备起来。
    如毛泽东同志所说，我国的“一穷二白”看起来是坏事，其实是好事。正是因为穷，我国广大群众改革生产技术的要求十分迫切，进行技术革命的干劲十分大。正是因为白，我们可以不受旧事物的束缚，自由地充分地利用世界最新科学技术成就，更加有效地、更加合理地开发和利用我们的资源，安排我们的生产，做到后来居上。例如苏联帮助我国建设的工业骨干，就采用了最新的技术。我们准备建立的长江三峡水力枢纽，是世界上最大最复杂的水利工程，将成为世界上最大的水力发电站。我国资源非常丰富，已开采了的比较少，这是我们比先进资本主义国家优越的地方；我们应该充分发挥这种有利的条件，最合理地利用这些无限丰富的资源。
    实现技术革命和文化革命是当前全党全民的历史任务。其中科学技术工作占着非常重要的地位。
    党中央一向是十分重视科学技术研究工作的。1956年初，中央召开的知识分子问题会议上就发出了“向科学进军”的号召，并要求在十二年内使我国最重要的科学技术部门赶上或接近世界先进水平。两年多来，我们制订了科学技术发展远景规划，我国的科学事业虽有了较大的发展，但是还远远不能适应目前技术革命的要求，对于地方科学技术研究的发展、群众的技术革新和工具改良过去更是注意得不够。今年3月，中央召开的成都会议提出了在各省、自治区、专区和有条件的县建立科学研究机构的意见，对于全党抓科学技术起着重要的推动作用。在这以后，各地科学事业开始了迅速的发展，有一些乡、社也根据自己的需要开展起科学研究工作来了。
    在技术革命和文化革命运动中，科学技术工作的主要任务是研究和解决工农业生产建设中所提出的迫切问题，为生产的跃进服务。理论性的、长远性的科学研究工作也是不可忽视的一方面。在科学技术工作中，我们必须反对脱离实际的倾向，但是也必须看得远一点，不要走到狭小的圈子里去，以至阻碍科学技术的进一步发展。
    对于群众在科学和技术上的创造和发明，必须给予足够的重视，积极地加以总结、提高和推广。群众在生产实践中的发明创造是科学技术发展的重要源泉，应该在普及的基础上加以提高，在提高的指导下进行普及。我们决不能听任那些有益的发明创造和先进经验，因为缺乏科学技术的支援而昙花一现。幼芽是不能长期存在的，要么发展成长，要么就枯萎死亡。我们要以最大的热情来发挥群众的智慧，使群众性的技术革新运动不断地推向新的高峰。
    从去冬今春开始，全国各地已经掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众性的改良工具和革新技术的运动。这个运动，对在我国实现技术革命具有极其重要意义。但是直到现在，还有人认为这种工具改良和技术革新，从现代科学技术的眼光来说，是低级的东西，没有什么了不起。他们不懂得，正是无数这种“没有什么了不起”的创造发明，能够提高劳动生产率几倍几十倍，为在经济上和技术上使全国生产部门转到现代化大生产的基础上准备条件。群众的积极性创造性的充分发挥，使我国能够以跃进的速度把我们国家建设成为拥有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代化科学文化的社会主义国家。这种轰轰烈烈的群众运动只有在社会主义国家里才能做到，而在资本主义国家里是不可想像的。这是社会主义制度优越性的表现，是广大劳动群众共产主义思想大解放的表现。应该看到群众性的改良工具和技术革新运动本身就带有伟大的革命意义。
    广泛开展群众性的工具改良和技术革新运动，并不意味着可以忽视最新科学技术的采用。有人认为在工农业中采用新技术，花钱多，掌握难，因而对这件事就不那么热心。其实任何一种新的技术所以能够出现，能够站得住脚，代替旧的技术，都因为在经济上或是运用上有它的优越性。在条件具备的情况下，采用新技术，就能达到多、快、好、省的目的。例如高分子化合物可以用来制造原先由金属和动植物纤维制造的产品，它是近二十年发展起来的新技术。发展高分子化合物工业，就能为制造各种器械和用品开辟丰富的材料来源，就能多、快、好、省地解决许多生产上和消费上的需要。又如在第二次世界大战期间发展起来的抗生素生产，不但在医药上有重大价值，而且在农业和畜牧业上也有重大价值。至于掌握高分子化合物和抗生素的生产技术，根据国内几年来的经验，并不是什么特别困难的事，在经济上也是合算的。
    对于现代科学技术发展的最新部门，我们必须集中力量，加紧研究。我们完全应该而且完全可能做到在不太长的时间内掌握原子裂变和热核反应，在各方面利用原子能的最新技术，掌握无线电和电子学的最新技术，掌握喷气、火箭直至征服外层空间的最新技术，掌握制造具有耐高压、耐高温、耐强放射性辐射的高强度的金属和非金属的材料，掌握制造高效能的液体和固体燃料的新技术，掌握制造精密机械和自动化机械的最新技术。我们应该在这些科学技术研究成果的基础上努力发展我国的工农业生产，提高我国人民的生活水平，并且迅速地加强我们保卫祖国保卫和平的力量。很明显，在我们的道路上不是没有困难的，但是只要在战略上藐视这些困难，而在战术上重视这些困难，鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研，兢兢业业地工作，那么，摆在我们面前的光荣的任务是一定能够完成的。
    社会主义的大跃进是全面大跃进，科学技术研究工作也要大跃进。实际问题的研究要跃进，理论问题的研究也要跃进；当前生产问题的研究要跃进，长远建设问题的研究也要跃进。当然，对于各个不同的研究机关、不同的地区，仍然必须根据具体情况，有重点、有步骤地前进。
    为了实现科学技术研究工作的全面跃进，就必须全党抓科学技术工作，把科学技术的研究从狭小的范围引向广阔的天地。中国科学院、中央各部门的研究机构应该负责比较重大的、生产中关键性的、带有全国意义的问题的研究；省、市、自治区的研究机构，应该密切结合本地的生产实际的需要开展研究；专区和县的研究机构则应该负担比较初级的研究；这只是大致的划分，实际上某些地方也可以而且必然要负担全国性的研究任务，中央各部门直接领导的某些研究机构也必须负担一部分地方提出的研究任务。至于普及和推广工作，无论那一级的组织都负有一定的责任。
    这里特别要指出，目前高等学校的研究力量还远没有得到充分的发挥。在教育体制改变，大量高等学校下放地方领导之后，各省、市、自治区应该给他们研究任务，在教学和研究兼顾的条件下，适当地安排他们的研究工作。
    为了把科学技术事业办好，必须解决几个思想问题。
    第一，要反对依赖思想。过去八年来，在科学技术工作方面也如在其他方面一样，伟大的苏联和其他兄弟国家给了我国巨大的慷慨的援助，这是我国人民所深深感谢的。在今后，我们仍然需要苏联的兄弟般的援助。但是有人认为，只要有苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助就够了，我们可以不必自己进行比较繁难的研究。这种想法是不正确的。学习苏联，掌握苏联和其他国家先进的科学技术成就，是我国科学技术迅速发展的途径，这是毫无疑义的。但是这决不是说我们可以采取自己不努力的依赖态度。这种错误的态度不但有害于发展我国的科学技术事业，对于整个社会主义阵营科学技术事业的发展也是不利的。而且由于我国的自然条件和建设工作的特点，事实上也不能完全搬用其他国家的现成经验。在地质、气象、采矿工作上是如此，在农业、工业、医药卫生事业上也是如此。许多结合我国特点的研究，不仅可以为我国生产建设解决问题，同时也将给世界科学宝库增加一分财产。
    第二，要反对自卑情绪。有人认为我国科学技术水平太低，解决不了什么问题；西方国家没有解决的问题，我们就不必甚至不应该研究。他们不相信自己的科学技术人员，不相信工农群众的创造，不相信我国丰富的历史遗产。有许多技术问题虽然我国已经可以解决甚至已经解决，但是有些人仍然请求兄弟国家研究设计，这就不仅给兄弟国家增加不必要的负担，也妨碍我国科学技术力量的成长。我们必须虚心学习国外的先进经验，这一点不能有任何动摇。但是决不应该因此而丧失民族的应有的自信。缺乏民族的自信，也就是缺乏对于六亿人民的创造力的信任。对群众的创造性的劳动和新生力量的生长采取老爷式的态度，这是人民事业的利益所决不允许的。
    第三，要破除迷信，反对把科学“神秘化”的观点。党中央号召我们破除迷信，这对发展我国科学技术事业是有非常重要的意义。那种怕科学家、怕教授，不敢去领导科学技术工作的思想应该彻底改变。固然，科学技术研究工作涉及许多专门的知识，强不知以为知的态度必须反对；但是只要方向正确，方法对头，依靠群众，刻苦钻研，党对科学技术工作是完全可以领导起来的，在这个问题上的怀疑和动摇是完全错误的。事实上，许多工农业生产部门和许多地区的党员领导干部，经过实践的锻炼和系统的学习，正在开始成为本行的专家。一些科学研究机构的党员领导同志，经过几年的钻研业务，不仅在政治思想上能进行领导，而且在业务工作中也有了一定的发言权。把科学神秘化的看法是没有根据的。
    为了发展我国科学技术事业，必须迅速整顿、培养和扩大我国科学技术队伍。
    现在我们的科学技术队伍还小，兵种还不全，我们同资产阶级科学家间关于两条道路的斗争还未完全解决。为了解决这个问题，首先，要继续对现有的科学技术人员进行思想改造。在整风运动中，我国知识界掀起了一个自我改造运动，这次运动比历次运动对知识分子的教育和改造都更加深刻，更加广泛。大字报、大辩论对许多科学技术人员作了群众性的鉴定。运动中揭露出来有一些人的资产阶级思想是非常严重的。例如为了个人名利，不愿意研究国家建设中迫切需要解决的问题，而孜孜于钻牛角尖的题目；投机取巧，剽窃别人的研究成果；墨守成规，拒绝新鲜事物；权威自居，压制新生力量；反对必要的集体研究；脱离生产，脱离实际的倾向；等等。他们的这种错误思想对青年一代的影响是很大的，对科学事业的发展是有很大妨碍的。我们必须抓紧思想改造这一环，取得思想战线上社会主义革命的彻底胜利。我们必须教育科学工作者努力学习马列主义，刻苦钻研科学技术业务，接近群众，面向生产，结合我国实际需要进行研究工作，全心全意为社会主义建设服务，成为具有高度革命热诚和丰富科学知识的又红又专的科学工作者。
    其次，要加紧培养新生力量，这是建立我国科学技术队伍的主要途径。培养的办法，除去一般的在学校中培养以外，还应注意：（1）改善在职干部和研究生的培养制度和培养方法。扩大选派留学生的名额。（2）开办新型的大学，选拔优秀的高中毕业生，在科学技术上给予比较严格的训练。在大学三、四年级时，学生就在相关的研究机构中实习或参加一部分研究工作。这样可以加快新的科学力量的生长，特别对于那些新兴的学科和需要较多设备的部门更加重要。（3）培养和建立科学研究机构的技术队伍，包括技术工人和技师。（4）从工人和农民中培养科学技术的骨干，许多工人、农民和练习生、技术员等青年在这次大跃进中，在技术上做出了出色的成绩，应该鼓励和帮助他们继续钻研，有计划地给他们以深造的机会。（5）大力开展科学普及工作，培养数以百万计的初级工业和农业科学技术人才，使之成为工矿农村中普及科学知识和推广新技术的骨干。（6）组织干部钻研技术、学习科学，学会领导科学技术工作的本领。抽出一部分优秀的在职干部，进行短期的培养训练，扩大科学技术队伍，这是科学技术事业的长远利益所必要的，也是目前我国干部的现实条件所许可的。
    经过一年来的整风运动和反右派斗争，党在科学事业上的领导权肯定是加强了。科学界在这一时期内不仅在政治思想上有了显著的进步，而且在科学研究工作中通过两条道路和两种方法的辩论，也有了比较大的转变。目前的形势的特点是，群众性的技术革新运动正在发展，广大的科学技术界在整风运动的基础上，在思想上和工作上还在跃进。只要我们全党努力来抓科学技术工作，加强对于这个战线的领导，十二年科学技术远景规划就一定能够实现，赶上世界科学技术先进水平的任务就一定能够在较短的时期内完成。
