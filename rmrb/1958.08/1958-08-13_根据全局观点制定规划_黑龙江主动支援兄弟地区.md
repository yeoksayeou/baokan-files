Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 12th - At the industrial conference held by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee at the end of July, it was decided to fully utilize the province's industrial foundation and make every effort to vigorously support the large-scale industrial construction of brother regions across the country.

    In order to successfully fulfill the task of supporting brother regions, the conference requested that cities with relatively developed industries should not only formulate their own development plans, but also formulate plans to support others. In order to support others, cities with relatively developed industries can slow down their own construction speed, thereby helping others to vigorously develop. The specific requirements put forward by the Provincial Party Committee to various regions are: 1. Regarding the support of materials, equipment, and personnel, all regions, cities, and counties must obey the central government's deployment and the province's deployment; 2. Strengthen the collaboration between regions, cities, and counties, and exchange each other in terms of raw material specifications and varieties; 3. Regardless of whether the products ordered by various enterprises within or outside the province have been arranged for materials, they must be completed on schedule; 4. Equipment and materials that are not used or are not very useful should be transferred to units that urgently need them; 5. The work of vigorously supporting other regions should be planned uniformly by the province, and implemented by various regions, cities, and counties.

    This year, under the unified arrangement of the state, Heilongjiang Province will support no less than one hundred kinds of industrial products to the whole country. Major equipment includes complete sets of hydroelectric generating units, metallurgical equipment, and mining machinery, while smaller precision products include tools, instruments, and bearings. From modern large factories to handicraft production cooperatives, all are actively manufacturing products for various regions. Currently, the metallurgical equipment being manufactured by machinery manufacturing plants across the province includes sixteen blast furnaces with volumes of one hundred and two hundred and fifty-five cubic meters, and forty-two steelmaking converters of three to six tons and steelmaking converters of 0.5 to 2 tons. These metallurgical equipment will be supplied to dozens of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions including Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Tianjin, and Beijing to meet the needs of building the steel industry.

    In order to better support others, this conference determined that the iron and steel industry should be vigorously developed throughout the province, and the corresponding development of electric power, petroleum, transportation and other industries should also be promoted. This year, iron smelting furnaces will be built in more than fifty cities and counties across the province. It is planned to smelt 200,000 tons of iron by the end of the year. Currently, thirty-six iron and steel furnaces have been built. This year, the province plans to produce 570,000 tons of steel and 1,000 tons of copper. The conference also made specific arrangements for the various equipment needed to develop the iron and steel industry.

    根据全局观点制定规划
　　黑龙江主动支援兄弟地区
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　中共黑龙江省委在7月底召开的工业会议上，决定充分运用本省的工业基础，千方百计地大力支援全国兄弟地区进行大规模的工业建设。
    为了很好地完成支援兄弟地区的任务，会议要求工业较发达的城市不仅应作出自己的发展规划，而且要做出支援别人的规划。为了支援别人，在工业较发达的城市可以放缓一下自己的建设速度，从而帮助别人大力建设。省委向各地提出的具体要求是：一、关于物资、设备、人员的支援，各地、市、县必须服从中央的调动和省的调动；二、加强各地、市、县的协作，在原材料规格品种上可以相互串换；三、不论省内、外在各企业已订货的产品，只要材料作了安排必须按期完成；四、自己不用或用处不大的设备、物资要调给急需的单位使用；五、对外地大力支援的工作由省统一筹划，各地、市、县执行。
    今年，黑龙江省支援全国的工业产品在国家统一安排下不下一百种，大的有成套的水力发电机组、冶金设备和矿山机械等重大设备，小的有工具、仪表、轴承等精密产品。从现代化的大工厂到手工业生产合作社都在积极为各地制造产品。目前，全省各机械制造厂正在制造的冶金设备，有一百、二百五十五立方公尺的高炉十六座，三吨到六吨的炼钢转炉和○·五吨到两吨的炼钢转炉四十二座。这些冶金设备将分别供应云南、贵州、四川、新疆、江西、安徽、甘肃、青海、宁夏、天津、北京等几十个省、市、自治区建设钢铁工业需要。
    为了更好地支援别人，这次会议确定在全省范围内要大力发展钢铁工业，相应发展电力、石油、交通运输及其他工业。今年，全省将在五十多个市、县建起炼铁炉，到年底计划炼铁二十万吨，目前已建成的钢铁炉达三十六座。今年，全省计划产钢五十七万吨、产铜一千吨。会议对发展钢铁工业所需的各种设备也作了具体安排。
