Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st. The Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative of Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, which was the first in the country to boldly propose the idea of experimental fields for rice yields of 10,000 jin per mu, harvested its early rice from the experimental fields on the 29th, greatly exceeding the original plan. They harvested 18,587 jin of dried grain from 1.21 mu of land, averaging 15,361 jin of grain per mu.

This experimental field was jointly cultivated by Guan Musheng, the famous national agricultural labor model and head of the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative, and the cooperative's youth shock brigade. They boldly proposed a plan for a yield of 10,000 jin per mu, unafraid of any sarcasm or ridicule, determined to set an example for some conservatives to see. In this field, they vigorously implemented dense planting, generally planting only 30,000 to 40,000 seedlings per mu, while they planted 244,000 seedlings per mu. The fertilizer application was also very appropriate, with organic and inorganic fertilizers combined equivalent to 925 jin of soybean cake per mu. The field was ploughed to a depth of more than eight inches. After transplanting, weeding and irrigation management were carried out very well, so the rice grew tall and strong, appearing a dark black color. Each mu had more than 2.4 million ears, and the grains were full.

Because Guan Musheng's experimental field was the first 10,000-jin experimental field proposed in the country, it not only attracted the attention of the people here, but also attracted special attention from people in many parts of the country. When harvesting and threshing on the 29th, many people were present to participate in the acceptance. Among them were Wang Zhenming, the first secretary of the Xiaogan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhu Chaoqi, the first secretary of the Pengxing District Party Committee of the Xiaogan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zheng Jiannan, associate researcher of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, agricultural experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central China Agricultural Science Institute, and the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture, as well as representatives from Guizhou and other provinces who came to visit, and local farmer representatives, a total of more than 120 people.

    长风社乘长风破万里浪
    早稻亩产一万五千斤
    据新华社武汉31日电　全国最先大胆提出搞水稻亩产万斤试验田的湖北省孝感县长风农业社，29日收打了试验田的早稻，大大超过了原来的规划。他们在一点二一亩田里，收到了干谷一万八千五百八十七斤，平均亩产谷一万五千三百六十一斤。
    这块试验田是著名的全国农业劳动模范、长风农业社社长官木生和这个社的青年突击队合种的。他们大胆提出亩产万斤的规划，不怕任何讽刺和讥笑，决心要干个样儿出来给一些保守派看看。他们在这块田里，狠狠地搞密插，一般田都是每亩只插三、四万蔸，他们每亩插了二十四万四千蔸。肥料施得也很合适，每亩施的有机肥、无机肥加在一块，折合豆饼九百二十五斤。这块田翻耕的深度有八寸多。插秧后薅草、灌水等管理工作做得很好，因而稻子长得又高又壮，一片乌黑。每亩的穗有二百四十多万个，并且籽粒饱满。
    由于官木生的这块试验田是全国最早提出来的一块万斤试验田，所以不仅这里的人众目睽睽，注意个究竟，全国很多地方的人们也特别注意。在29日收割、打场的时候，在场参加验收的人很多。有中共孝感县委第一书记王振明，中共孝感县朋兴区委第一书记朱朝启，中国农业科学院副研究员郑建南，中国科学院、华中农业科学研究所、湖北省农业厅的农业专家们，还有贵州等省前来参观的代表们，本地的农民代表们，一共一百二十多人。
