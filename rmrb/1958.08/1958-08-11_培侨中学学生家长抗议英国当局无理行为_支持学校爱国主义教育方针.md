Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 9th. Over five hundred parents of students at Hong Kong's Pui Kiu Middle School gathered on the evening of the 8th to protest the unreasonable measure by the Hong Kong British authorities in forcibly removing the school's principal, Du Boqui, from Hong Kong.

    A person in charge of Pui Kiu Middle School reported at the meeting about the persecution of their school by the Hong Kong British authorities and the forced deportation of Principal Du Boqui. They said, "Since the incident, the educational circles of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau, as well as people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Macau, have expressed their support for Pui Kiu Middle School and have lodged protests with the Hong Kong authorities. This makes us deeply feel that the patriotic education cause is closely linked with the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Therefore, we believe that Hong Kong's progressive education cause will have greater development in the future."

    Many parents spoke at the meeting, unanimously condemning this unreasonable measure by the Hong Kong authorities to undermine the education cause. One parent angrily questioned the Hong Kong authorities at the meeting: "Pui Kiu Middle School teaches our children to understand principles, distinguish right from wrong, and love the motherland. What's wrong with that? On what grounds does the Hong Kong authorities deport Principal Du Boqui?" The parents attending the meeting expressed their firm support for the patriotic education policy established by Pui Kiu Middle School. The assembly also unanimously passed a protest statement on this incident. The statement said: "We protest against the Hong Kong British authorities' forced deportation of Principal Du Boqui! We affirm the achievements of Pui Kiu Middle School in educating our children! We will always support Pui Kiu in taking the direction of patriotic education."
