Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 9th: In Jilin Province, many urban and rural small and medium-sized factories are vigorously manufacturing ball bearings using both indigenous and foreign methods. They aim to achieve ball bearingization of agricultural tools, transportation tools, and irrigation and drainage tools throughout the province by October this year, completing the task of agricultural semi-mechanization and partial mechanization.

In counties such as Baicheng, Yushu, Hailong, and Anguang, which successfully trial-produced ball bearings in late July and early August, a batch of products has already been produced. Yushu County plans to produce tens of thousands of sets of ball bearings before the end of August. In order to install ball bearings on all agricultural tools and operating equipment that can be fitted with them before October, Baicheng County has mobilized all the dozen or so factories and workshops in the county that can produce such products to prepare for full-scale production. Machinery factories, agricultural tool factories, and handicraft cooperatives in Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan, Gongzhuling, and other places are also actively organizing the production of ball bearings.

Under the leadership of the Party committees, the production of ball bearings is gradually forming a high tide after the masses broke through the mysterious viewpoints. Jilin Provincial Machinery Factory and Agricultural Machinery Factory are fully adopting indigenous methods to tap production potential and vigorously engage in the production of ball bearings without increasing equipment or building new or expanding workshops. The Provincial Machinery Factory has decided to produce 10,000 sets of oil-containing bearings from August this year to May next year. Changchun Automobile Accessory Tool Factory and Gongzhuling Yongxing Machinery Factory are being expanded to increase production capacity and adapt to the needs of large-scale ball bearing production.

In order to promote the experience of large-scale ball bearing production, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an on-site meeting in the Baicheng area.

    吉林土洋两种办法并举
    据新华社长春9日电　吉林省很多城乡的中小工厂正在用土洋办法大造滚珠轴承，争取全省在今年10月实现农具、交通工具、排灌工具滚珠轴承化，完成农业半机械化和部分机械化的任务。
    在7月底和8月初试制成功滚珠轴承的白城、榆树、海龙、安广等县，都已出产了一批产品。榆树县计划8月底前生产几万套滚珠轴承。白城县为了在10月以前把所有能够安装滚珠轴承的农具和运转工具都安上滚珠轴承，全县所有可以生产这种产品的十多个工厂和车间都已动员起来，准备全力投入生产。长春、吉林、四平、辽源、公主岭等地的机械厂、农具厂和手工业合作社也正在积极组织生产滚珠轴承。
    各地中小工厂在党委领导下，发动群众打破了神秘观点后，滚珠轴承的生产正逐渐形成高潮。吉林省机械厂和农业机械厂在不增加设备、不新建和扩建车间的情况下，充分采取土办法挖掘生产潜力，大搞滚珠轴承的生产。省机械厂决定从今年8月到明年5月要制出一万套含油轴承。长春汽车随车工具厂、公主岭永兴机械厂正在进行扩建，以便提高生产能力，适应大造滚珠轴承的需要。
    为了推广大造滚珠轴承的经验，中共吉林省委最近在白城专区召开了现场会议。
