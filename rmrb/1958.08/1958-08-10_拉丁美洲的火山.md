The raging flames of Latin American people's struggle for national independence and liberation from American enslavement are spreading like wildfire!

Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev stated in their joint communiqué: China and the Soviet Union firmly support the just struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Republic of Iraq, and other Arab countries, and firmly support the national independence movements of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Events in the Middle East and other parts of the world prove that the national liberation movement is an irresistible trend, the colonial era is gone forever, and any attempt to maintain or restore colonial rule against the tide of history endangers the cause of peace and is doomed to failure.

Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev declared to the world in a resounding voice: The national independence movement of the Latin American countries is an irresistible part of the world's national liberation movement and an indivisible part of the worldwide cause against war and in defense of peace. The imperialist colonial rule is doomed to fail. Even the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" had to admit: "Rage is burning in Latin America..."

American imperialists can never forget Latin America. Because there are abundant rubber, cocoa, bananas, cotton; and immeasurable underground mineral deposits: iron ore, oil, gold.... They forever make the Wall Street imperialists watch with covetous eyes and drool. This spring, American Vice President Nixon went to South America for a "visit," but the people of South American countries responded with stones and rotten eggs. Then, American President Eisenhower's brother, Milton Eisenhower, "visited" Central American countries, and also scurried back amidst roars of "Yankee, go home!" Recently, American Secretary of State Dulles "visited" Brazil, and his embarrassing situation was exactly the same as Nixon's. As soon as he arrived in Brazil, he was met with a chorus of "Go home!" from the Brazilian people. The building of the National Student Union of Brazil was completely draped in black gauze, and a banner with the slogan "Dulles Go Home!" was hung in the middle of the building.

Latin America is a volcano under the feet of American imperialists, ready to erupt. No matter how eloquently the "Yankees" sitting on the crater try to deceive, they cannot prevent it from erupting.

    拉丁美洲的火山
    于尚思
    拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立和摆脱美国奴役的熊熊之火，正在以燎原之势延烧起来！
    毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在会谈公报中说：中苏两国坚决支持阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动。中近东地区和世界其他地区的事件证明，民族解放运动是不可抗拒的潮流，殖民主义时代已经一去不复返了，任何维持和恢复违背历史潮流的殖民统治的企图都是危害和平事业，都是注定要失败的。
    毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志用宏亮的声音向全世界宣告：拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动是世界民族解放运动不可抗拒的潮流的一部分，是全世界反对战争、维护和平事业的不可分割的一部分。帝国主义的殖民统治是注定要失败的。甚至连“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”，也不得不承认：“怒火燃烧着拉丁美洲……”。
    美国帝国主义者总是不能忘怀拉丁美洲。因为，那里有丰富的橡胶、可可、香蕉、棉花；有不可计量的地下矿藏：铁矿、石油、黄金……。它们永远使华尔街的帝国主义者虎视眈眈，垂涎三尺。今年春天，美国副总统尼克松到南美去“访问”，但是南美各国的人民，却报之以石头和臭蛋的袭击。接着，美国总统艾森豪威尔的弟弟密尔顿·艾森豪威尔“访问”中美洲各国，也是在“美国佬，滚回去”的怒吼声中跑回来的。最近，美国国务卿杜勒斯“访问”巴西，他跟尼克松的狼狈相一模一样，刚到巴西时，碰到的就是巴西人的一片“滚回去”的口号声。巴西全国学生联合会的大楼，并且全部披上了黑纱，大楼中间悬挂着横幅标语：“杜勒斯回家去！”
    拉丁美洲是美帝国主义者脚下正在爆发的一座火山。不管坐在这座火山喷口上的“美国佬”怎样花言巧语，也是无法使它不爆发的。
