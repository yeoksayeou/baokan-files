　　Stinky Ponds Transformed into Biogas Energy Plants
　　Wei County Establishes Plants in Every Township, Stations in Every Commune, and Brings Light to Every Household
    (Our report) Wei County, Hebei Province, is using the stinky water and sludge from pits and ponds to produce biogas, opening up a new way for rural areas to achieve electrification quickly, efficiently, and economically.
    In the past, people mostly used manure to produce biogas, but Wang Shuxiu, a female member of the Communist Youth League in Beili Village, Wei County, found a new energy source in the sewage pools of pits and ponds.
    With the support of the village Party branch, Wang Shuxiu, following the biogas production technology she learned during a visit to another location, boldly conducted biogas extraction experiments in the sewage pit next to the village with her young partners, Wang Zhibin and others. After several failures, they finally succeeded. Flames more than a foot long emerged from the surface of the sewage pit, transforming a stinky pond that had been disliked for years into a biogas energy plant that could generate bright light.
    The county Party committee immediately launched on-site technical training, and a mass movement to vigorously develop biogas was launched in Wei County. Many cooperatives sent people to Beili Village to observe the biogas extraction performance of Wang Shuxiu and others in the sewage pit. In many villages, 80% of young men and women mastered the technology of extracting biogas from pits and ponds, and large numbers of biogas professional shock brigades were organized. Various communes also continued to create various biogas digesters using clay instead of cement, such as horizontal, vertical, pressurized, hydraulic, and yin-yang ground types, according to different conditions and needs, to drive machinery, provide lighting, and cook food. In order to shorten the fermentation time, some communes also created methods of mixing materials in sewage and using wheat bran water as a fermentation starter, as well as rapid fermentation methods such as sun exposure during the day and enclosure at night, or adding warm water, lime, and soda; various mixers were also invented. After having biogas, the masses used reeds, hemp stalks, bamboo poles, and chicken and duck intestines to replace rubber pipes for transporting biogas, and used clay to make biogas lamp nozzles and biogas stoves.
    By late July, the county had built 521 biogas power plants capable of driving machinery, 2,683 biogas stations, and 60,160 biogas piles to facilitate lighting and cooking for commune members, achieving plants in every township, stations in every commune, and piles in every household, with biogas flames burning everywhere (more than 18,000 households in the county have lit biogas lamps or use biogas stoves for cooking). According to the efficiency of the biogas plants and stations already built in the county, the biogas generated by these plants and stations can be used to irrigate 96,000 mu of land per day, saving 3,200 laborers; equivalent to replacing more than 60,000 head of livestock. The first goal of the current movement in this county is to use biogas for lighting and cooking. It is estimated that the county can save 930,000 jin of kerosene and 160 million jin of coal per year.

　　臭水坑变成沼气能源厂
　　威县乡乡设厂　社社有站　户户放光明
    本报讯　河北省威县利用坑塘里臭水污泥制取沼气，为农村多快好省地实现电气化开辟了新途径。
    过去人们大都用粪便制取沼气，威县北里村女共青团员王淑秀却从坑塘污池中找到了新的能源。
    王淑秀按照从外地参观时学来的制取沼气的技术，在中共村支部的支持下，联合了青年伙伴王之彬等大胆地在村边的污水坑里进行了取沼气的试验，他们经过几次失败之后终于成功。污水坑的水面上，放出了一尺多长的火花，多年来被人讨厌的臭水坑，变成了可以大放光明的沼气能源厂。
    县委立即开展了现场技术训练，一个大搞沼气的群众性的运动就在威县展开了。很多合作社都派人到北里村参观王淑秀等人在污水坑里取沼气的表演，许多村庄80％的青年男女都掌握了在坑塘里提取沼气的技术，沼气专业突击队大批组织起来。各社还根据不同条件和需要，继续创造了用胶泥代替水泥修建卧式、立式、气压、水压式和阴阳地等多种沼气池，用来带动机器和照明作饭。为了缩短发酵时间，有些社还创造了在污水中拌料和用麦糠水作发酵头，以及日晒夜闭或加温水、石灰、苏打等快速发酵法；创造了多种搅拌机。在有了沼气之后，群众又用苇子、麻秸秆、竹竿、鸡、鸭肠子等代替胶皮管输送沼气，用胶泥制沼气灯嘴和沼气炉。
    到7月下旬，全县已建起能带动机器的沼气发电厂五百二十一个，沼气站二千六百八十三个，便利社员照明作饭的沼气堆六万零一百六十个，达到了乡乡有厂，社社有站，户户有堆，到处燃起了沼气的火花（全县已有一万八千多户人家点上了沼气灯或用沼气炉作饭）。按照这个县已经搞成的沼气厂、站的效能计算，这些厂、站发出的沼气用于带动机器灌溉，每天可浇地九万六千亩，节省劳力三千二百个；代替畜力六万多头。当前这个县开展运动的第一个目标是用沼气点灯作饭。据估计，全县每年可以节省煤油九十三万斤，煤炭一亿六千万斤。（文英、李朴）
