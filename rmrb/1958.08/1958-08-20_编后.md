　　Practices Worth Promoting
　　Since the Great Leap Forward, countless female heroines, surpassing even Mu Guiying, have emerged across the country. However, women have different physiological conditions and strengths than men and should be given necessary consideration. The Yangjia Cooperative in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has organized various women's professional teams, which not only allows women to "make the best use of their talents" but also promotes the overall development of the cooperative's production. This practice is worth promoting.
　　Congratulations on the Establishment of the Dawoer Autonomous Banner
　　The Molidawa Dawoer Autonomous Banner has been established. This is the third autonomous banner established in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with the help of Mongolians and Han people for other ethnic minorities within its borders. The establishment of the Dawoer Autonomous Banner marks a new stage in the development and prosperity of the Dawoer people in the autonomous region. We warmly congratulate the establishment of the Dawoer Autonomous Banner and hope that the Dawoer people, in the Great Leap Forward of the motherland, will leap forward together with all other ethnic groups in the country.
　　Observing Street Changes from a Small Alley
　　The changes in city streets are truly astonishing. Yesterday, we comprehensively introduced Hongshunli in Tianjin. Today, we have organized the "Beijing Alley" column to invite readers to take another look at the changes in a hutong in Beijing. Dachuan Road Second Alley is just one of the thousands of hutongs in Beijing. By looking at the overall situation from this one point, one can imagine the tremendous changes in the entire street work.

　　值得提倡的做法
    大跃进以来，全国各地出现了无数个赛过穆桂英的女英雄人物。但是，妇女有和男子不同的生理条件和特长，应该作必要的照顾。湖南浏阳县杨家社，组织了各种妇女专业队，一方面使妇女能“人尽其才”，另一方面又促进了合作社的生产全面发展。这种做法值得提倡。
    祝达斡尔自治旗成立
    莫力达瓦达斡尔自治旗成立了。这是内蒙古自治区蒙古族和汉族帮助境内其他少数民族建立的第三个自治旗。达斡尔自治旗的成立，标志着自治区内达斡尔族的发展繁荣走上了一个新阶段。我们热烈祝贺达斡尔自治旗的成立，并望达斡尔民族在祖国大跃进中，和全国其他民族一起共同跃进。
　  从一条小巷看街道变化
    城市街道的变化真是惊人。昨天我们比较全面地介绍了天津的鸿顺里，今天又组织了“北京一巷”这个专栏，再请读者看一看北京一条胡同的变化。大川路二巷只是北京千百个胡同中的一个，从一点看全面，可以想像到整个街道工作的巨大变化。
