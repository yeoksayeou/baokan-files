　　High Yields of "Polyspike Sorghum"
　　(Our dispatch) The polyspike sorghum in many areas of Hebei Province is generally growing well, and most of it is currently undergoing the grain-filling and sun-drying stage, promising a bumper harvest. In Funing County of Tangshan Prefecture, this year's polyspike sorghum is growing better than in previous years. Based on the current situation, the average yield per mu can reach 1,000 jin, and a few high-yield fields can reach over 3,000 jin.

　　A "satellite" of polyspike sorghum is being processed and cultivated in the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Hengshui County of this province. The cooperative's two mu of polyspike sorghum experimental fields are planted with an average of 5,000 plants per mu, each plant has five spikes, and each spike can yield twelve liang of grain. If the actual yield of this field matches the current estimated figure, each mu can yield 18,000 jin of sorghum.

　　Some agricultural cooperatives in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, that are planting polyspike sorghum have made preparations for experimental retention of regenerated sorghum, planning to harvest several hundred more jin of grain from the regenerated sorghum. According to personnel from the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Department who are familiar with this aspect, polyspike sorghum can be harvested in another ten days. Retaining regenerated sorghum in this type of field, plus sufficient water and a large amount of fertilizer, makes it possible to harvest an extra crop. Whether this new experiment will succeed remains to be proven in practice.

　　Many prefectures in Hebei Province have expanded the planting of polyspike sorghum this year. The three prefectures of Tangshan, Handan, and Tianjin alone have planted more than 1.15 million mu.

　　(Our dispatch) This year, Shangqiu Prefecture in Henan Province has trial-planted 5,828 mu of polyspike sorghum, and the production situation is very good. Currently, the early-maturing sorghum has begun to be harvested, and will soon be completely harvested within half a day. It is estimated that the yield per mu will reach 1,000 to 1,500 jin. In Gaokou Township, Luyi County, there are 60 mu of polyspike sorghum, and it is estimated that each mu can yield 20,000 jin.

　　The planting of polyspike sorghum in Shangqiu Prefecture started in Luyi County. Zhao Zhongliang, a demobilized soldier from Gaokou Township in the county, brought the seeds from Liaoning in 1955 and trial-planted one fen of land that year, actually harvesting 50 jin of sorghum. This matter aroused interest among the local people, so the county agricultural bureau summarized the production situation of polyspike sorghum and organized people to visit the site. In 1957, the area planted with polyspike sorghum in Luyi County expanded to 90 mu, with an average yield of about 800 jin per mu. The planting of polyspike sorghum in Gaokou Township of this county has reached 1,000 mu, including 60 mu. This spring, after the prefecture held an on-site meeting in Luyi, the whole area began trial planting, but it has already been widely promoted in Luyi County.

### “多穗高粱”产量高

　　“多穗高粱”产量高
    本报讯　河北省许多地区的多穗高粱普遍生长良好，大部正在灌浆晒米，丰收在望。唐山专区抚宁县今年的多穗高粱生长优于往年，从现在情况估算，平均亩产可以达到千斤，少数丰产田可到三千斤以上。
    一颗多穗高粱的“卫星”正在这个省衡水县曙光农业社里加工培植中。这个社的二亩多穗高粱试验田，平均亩种五千株，每株有穗五个，每穗可收籽实十二两。如果这块田的实际产量符合现在的这个估产数字，每亩可收高粱一万八千斤。
    河北省唐山专区一些种植多穗高粱的农业社都作了试验蓄留再生高粱的准备，计划从再生高梁上多收几百斤粮食。据河北省农业部门熟悉这方面情况的人员说，多穗高粱再有十天就可收获，在这种地里蓄留再生高粱，加上足够的水分、大量的肥料，多收一季是可能的。这个新的试验能否成功，有待实践证明。
    河北省许多专区今年都扩种多穗高粱，只唐山、邯郸、天津三个专区就种植了一百一十五万多亩。
    本报讯　河南省商丘专区今年试种多穗高梁五千八百二十八亩，生产情况很好。目前早熟的高粱已经开始收割，半日内即将全部收割完毕，预计亩产量将达一千至一千五百斤。鹿邑县高口乡有六十亩多穗高粱，估产每亩可达二万斤。
    商丘专区种多穗高粱是由鹿邑县开始的。该县高口乡转业军人赵中亮1955年从辽宁带来的种子，当年即试种一分地，实收高粱五十斤。这件事在当地群众中引起了兴趣，于是县农业局对多穗高粱的生产情况进行了总结，并且组织群众到现场参观。1957年，鹿邑县种植多穗高粱的面积即扩大到九十亩，平均亩产八百斤左右。这个县高口乡种多穗高粱已达一千亩，其中有六十亩，今年春天专区在鹿邑召开了现场会议后，全区开始了试种工作，但是在鹿邑县已经普遍推广。
