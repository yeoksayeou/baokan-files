　　Mountainous Area Transportation Ropeway-ized
    In Changhua County, Zhejiang Province, a technical innovation movement for transportation tools in mountainous areas has been launched.  Bamboo-frame aerial ropeways, steel cable ropeways, wooden rail cableways, and balance beam cableways, and other indigenous transportation tools have now been manufactured. The entire county is preparing to realize the ropeway-ization of mountainous area transportation before the end of October.

    Changhua is a resource-rich mountainous area.  In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, many materials could not be transported out. With ropeways and cableways, things are much easier. For example, after the ropeway was erected on Longtang Mountain, the twenty-kilometer journey from the mountaintop to the foot of the mountain was shortened to two thousand seven hundred meters, and transportation efficiency was increased by more than twenty times compared to manual carrying.

　　山区运输索道化
    浙江省昌化县掀起了山区运输工具技术革新运动。现在已制成了竹片架空索道、钢丝索道、木轨滑车道、天平车道等土法运输工具。全县准备在10月底以前实现山区运输索道化。
    昌化是一个资源丰富的山区。过去因交通不便，很多物资运不出来。有了索道、滑道就好办了。如龙塘山架设索道后，从山顶到山脚二十公里路程缩短为二千七百公尺，运输效率比人工挑运提高二十倍以上。
