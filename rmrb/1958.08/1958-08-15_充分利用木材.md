　　Make Full Use of Timber
    The Nanjing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau's Timber Processing Factory has achieved a log yield exceeding 100%. This is a matter of great significance.

    In the past, the log yield rate in various regions has always been low, averaging only about 70%. This year, the quantity of timber required by various localities and departments is very large, while the supply is quite tight. If all timber processing enterprises can apply Nanjing's experience and universally increase the timber yield rate by 20% to 30%, the country can save two to three million cubic meters of timber this year. In this way, not only can the difficulty of insufficient timber this year be basically solved, but it will also have an extremely important effect on future construction endeavors.

    We hope that timber factories in various regions will learn from Nanjing's experience, make every effort to increase the log yield rate, and make full use of timber.

　　充分利用木材
    南京市建筑工程局木材加工厂的原木出材率超过百分之百。这是一件有重大意义的事情。
    过去，各地原木出材率一向很低，平均只有70％左右。今年，各地方各部门需用木材的数量很大，而供应却相当紧张。如果各木材加工企业都能运用南京的经验，将木材出材率普遍提高20％到30％的话，全国今年就可以节约木材二、三百万立方公尺。这样，不仅可以基本上解决今年木材不足的困难，而且对今后的建设事业有着极其重要的作用。
    我们希望各地木材厂学习南京的经验，千方百计提高原木出材率，充分利用木材。
