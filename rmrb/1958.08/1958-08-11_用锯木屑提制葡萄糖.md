  　Extracting Glucose from Sawdust
    The Zhejiang Forestry Science Institute has successfully conducted experiments on extracting glucose from sawdust.
    Glucose has a wide range of uses in the pharmaceutical industry. Currently, in China, glucose is mainly extracted from starch, which consumes a lot of grain. The raw material used in Zhejiang's experimental extraction of glucose is fir sawdust. Every hundred catties of net dry sawdust, through processes such as hydrolysis, neutralization, concentration, crystallization, and separation, can yield twenty catties of glucose. The sweetness and color of the resulting sugar crystals are similar to those of commercially available oral glucose crystals.
    Zhejiang is rich in forest products. In the fir logging and processing work, more than 360 million catties of sawdust can be obtained every year. In the past, this sawdust was not well utilized. Now, if it is used to extract glucose, more than 61 million catties of glucose can be obtained, worth more than 86.5 million yuan. (Xinhua News Agency)

  　用锯木屑提制葡萄糖
    浙江林业科学研究所用锯木屑提制葡萄糖的试验已经成功。
    葡萄糖在医药工业上用途很广。目前在我国葡萄糖主要从淀粉中提制，消耗粮食很多。浙江试验提制葡萄糖的原料是杉木锯屑，每百斤净干锯木屑，通过水解、中和、浓缩、结晶和分离等操作过程，可得葡萄糖二十斤，所得糖的结晶的甜味和色泽都和市上出售的口服葡萄糖结晶相似。
    浙江林产丰富，杉木采伐加工工作中每年可获得锯屑三亿六百多万斤，过去这些锯屑没有很好利用。现在用来提制葡萄糖，就能得六千一百多万斤葡萄糖，价值八千六百五十多万元。　（新华社）
