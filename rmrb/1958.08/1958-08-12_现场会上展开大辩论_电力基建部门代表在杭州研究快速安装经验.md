Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th: The Shanghai Infrastructure Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently held an on-site meeting in Hangzhou to promote the experience of rapid installation of steam turbine generators. Representatives from relevant departments in Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities attended the meeting.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the construction speed of the power industry in East China has greatly increased. Many employees in infrastructure departments have created many new high-speed construction records. For example, workers at the Hangzhou construction site of the Shanghai Infrastructure Bureau completed the installation of a 10,000 kW steam turbine generator at the Hangzhou Power Plant in twenty-seven days, setting a new national record. The meeting extensively exchanged these rapid installation experiences.

Can steam turbine generators be installed at high speed? The attending representatives debated the advanced experience of the Hangzhou construction site. Some said that the Hangzhou construction site was an accidental phenomenon. Some said that the Hangzhou construction site's approach was a bit risky. However, the vast majority of representatives believed that the rapid installation experience of the Hangzhou construction site was the result of workers boldly breaking conventions, innovating technologies, and creating new tools.

During the meeting, the Qingdao construction site sent a telegram stating that workers had installed a 12,000 kW steam turbine generator in twenty-one days, breaking the record of the Hangzhou construction site. This eloquent fact more forcefully criticized the argument that rapid installation was "risky rush work."

Facts have proved that realizing cross-operation can fully guarantee quality and safe production. In cross-operation, as long as the spirit of communist collaboration is promoted, mutual support and mutual assistance can quickly solve problems that a single unit could not solve in the past. After a debate, the representatives reached a consensus in their thinking.

At the meeting, the Hangzhou construction site of the Shanghai Infrastructure Bureau was named the winning unit in the East China region's steam turbine generator installation competition for the second quarter of this year, and a banner and a 1,000 yuan bonus were awarded to the Hangzhou construction site.

### 现场会上展开大辩论　电力基建部门代表在杭州研究快速安装经验

　　现场会上展开大辩论
　　电力基建部门代表在杭州研究快速安装经验
    据新华社杭州11日电　水利电力部上海基建局最近在杭州召开现场会议，推广汽轮发电机快速安装经验。参加会议的有山东、安徽、江苏、浙江、福建、上海等省市有关部门的代表。
    大跃进以来，华东地区的电力工业建设速度有了很大提高。许多基建部门职工创造了许多高速度的施工新纪录。例如，上海基建局杭州工地职工以二十七天的时间，完成了杭州电厂一万瓩汽轮发电机的安装任务，创造了全国新纪录。会议广泛地交流了这些快速安装经验。
    能不能高速度地安装汽轮发电机？到会代表对杭州工地先进经验展开了辩论。有人说，杭州工地是偶然现象。有人说，杭州工地的做法有点冒险。但是绝大多数代表认为，杭州工地的快速安装经验是职工大胆打破常规、革新技术、创造新工具的结果。
    会议期间，青岛工地拍来一份电报：职工们用二十一天时间装好了一台一万二千瓩汽轮发电机，打破杭州工地的纪录。这个雄辩的事实，更有力地批判了认为快速安装是“冒险抢工”的论调。
    事实证明，实现交叉作业，完全可以保证质量和安全生产。在交叉作业中只要发扬共产主义的协作精神，互相支援、互相帮助，就可以使过去一个单位不能解决的问题，很快地得到解决。经过一场辩论以后，代表们在思想上取得一致。
    会上，上海基建局杭州工地被评为华东地区今年第二季度汽轮发电安装竞赛的优胜单位，并且将锦旗和一千元奖金授给了杭州工地。
