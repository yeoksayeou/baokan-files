    Daylight Cinema

    (Our Dispatch) The Wuhan Film Machine Repair Station and the Hongshan and Hanqiao film projection teams have jointly and successfully tested daylight cinema. Trial screenings have been held at the Zhongyuan and other cinemas for several days, with very good results and have been well received by audiences.

    Daylight projection is different from ordinary darkroom projection. In darkroom projection, the projector faces the front of the screen, with the lens tightly against the screen, so that the image of the film is magnified through the lens and sent to the screen. Daylight cinema places the projector behind the screen (the screen is about 130 cm wide and 110 cm long), with the rear or side of the machine facing the screen. A small mercury mirror is placed in front of the projector's lens at an angle of 60 degrees. During projection, the image on the film is reflected onto the mercury mirror, using the principle of optical refraction, and then projected onto the screen.

    白昼电影
    本报讯　武汉市电影机器修配站和洪山、汉桥电影放映队共同协作，已经将白昼电影试验成功。连日在中原等电影院试映，效果很好，深受观众欢迎。
    白昼放映与普通在暗室放映不同。暗室放映时，放映机是对着银幕的正面，镜头紧对着银幕，这样影片的画面通过镜头然后放大送到银幕上去。白昼电影则是将放映机放在银幕后（幕布约一百三十公分宽、一百一十公分长），机器的尾部或侧部对着银幕，在放映机的镜头前放一面小型水银镜，角度六十，放映时影片上的画面映在水银镜上，利用光学折射的原理，然后射在银幕上。
