    Labor Shortage Turns into Labor Surplus
    Chongqing Jialing Machine Factory Originally Planned to Transfer in 815, Now Extracts 480

    (Our newspaper's Chongqing dispatch, 6th) The Chongqing Jialing Machine Factory's production tasks for the second half of this year have increased by another 40% on the basis of several great leaps forward. Three new workshops have also been built. Originally, it was considered necessary to increase the labor force by 815 people. Later, every effort was made to tap labor potential from within the enterprise. As a result, not only were no additional people added, but it was also guaranteed that 480 employees could be extracted to support new factories.

    On the issue of tapping labor potential from within the enterprise, some people in the Jialing Machine Factory initially had ideological obstacles. Many people believed that if production tasks increased, more people would be needed to complete the tasks. Some people in some workshops believed that 892 laborers had already been saved in the first half of the year, and the potential had been almost fully exploited. Some workshops believed that the variety of products changed frequently, making it difficult to carry out technological innovation. At the same time, female workers were generally unwelcome. In response to these situations, the factory adopted the form of holding symposiums to launch debates among cadres, criticizing these conservative ideas and erroneous views. At the same time, cadres and workers were mobilized to conduct surveys and investigations into the labor potential of all aspects of the factory, and careful calculations were made. First, they focused on technological revolution. Once the masses were mobilized, each workshop put forward 65 measures within a few days. Among them, 13 measures to realize mechanization and automation of operations can save 240 people. Other improvements in tool clamps and processing methods, and the promotion of multi-machine tool management, can also save a large amount of labor. According to calculations, these 65 major measures can save a total of 443 laborers.

    Secondly, make full use of female labor. The entire factory conducted serious investigations to determine which jobs must be done by male workers and which can be done by female workers, and detailed accounts were calculated according to work type and work process. In the entire factory, there are a total of 65 types of work, of which 20 can be done entirely by female workers, and 24 can be done by both male and female workers. In addition, some young and middle-aged male workers in some auxiliary departments and welfare departments can be completely replaced by women. In this way, female workers in the entire factory can account for 70.88% of the total number of workers. At the same time, the factory also conducted a detailed survey among family members and registered them. In the future, they can be absorbed into the factory to work at any time according to production needs. They are also planning some "satellite" factories among family members to provide production and living services for the factory, and handing over some product assembly work and auxiliary materials to family members to do. In this way, some manpower can be saved to support the main production.

    In addition, the factory also adopted methods such as cadres participating in labor and strengthening cooperation with friendly factories to tap the existing labor potential. At present, the factory has insufficient equipment and manpower in casting, riveting, and welding. They entrusted some parts to a technical school for casting, and entrusted some equipment riveting and welding to local small factories for cooperation. Recently, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the Jialing Machine Factory in various factories and mines in the city.

### 劳力不足变成劳力有余  重庆嘉陵机器厂原想调进八百一现在抽出四百八

    劳力不足变成劳力有余
    重庆嘉陵机器厂原想调进八百一现在抽出四百八
    本报重庆6日电　重庆嘉陵机器厂今年下半年的生产任务在几次跃进的基础上又增加40％，还新建三个车间，原来考虑需要增加八百一十五个劳动力，后来千方百计从企业内部挖掘劳动潜力，结果不但不增人，还保证抽出四百八十个职工支援新厂。
    在从企业内部挖掘劳动潜力问题上，嘉陵机器厂开始有一部分人思想不通。不少人认为：生产任务增加了，就要增加人才能完成任务。有的车间有些人认为：上半年已经节约了八百九十二个劳动力，潜力已挖得差不多了。有的车间认为：品种多变，很难搞技术革新。同时普遍都不欢迎女工。厂里针对这些情况，采取召开座谈会的形式，在干部中展开辩论，批判了这些保守思想和错误的看法。同时，发动干部、职工对全厂各方面劳动潜力进行调查摸底，仔细计算。首先他们抓紧搞技术革命，群众一经发动，几天之内各车间就提出了六十五项措施。其中实现操作机械化、自动化的有十三项措施，可节省二百四十人。其他改进刀夹具和加工方法、推行多机床管理等，也能节省出大量劳动力。这六十五项重大措施计算起来，一共能节约四百四十三个劳动力。
    其次，充分利用妇女劳动力。全厂对那些工作一定要用男工，那些可以用女工，认真进行调查，按工种按工序算细账。全厂总计有六十五个工种，可以全部用女工的有二十个；男女兼用的有二十四个。此外，一些辅助部门和福利部门有一部分青壮年男工，完全可以由妇女调换，这样全厂女工可占工人总数的70.88％。同时，工厂又在家属中作了详细调查，在家属中进行登记，今后可以根据生产需要随时吸收进厂工作。他们还在家属中筹划一些为厂里生产和生活服务的“卫星”工厂，将一部分产品的装配工作、辅助材料，交给家属做。这样，就可以节约出一部分人力支援主要生产。
    此外，厂里还采取干部参加劳动，加强和友厂协作等挖掘现有劳动潜力的办法。目前厂里铸造、铆焊等工种，设备、人力感不足，他们把部分零件委托一个技工学校铸造，将一部分设备的铆焊委托地方小厂协作。最近中共重庆市委员会召开了现场会议，在全市各厂矿推广嘉陵机器厂的经验。
