Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: (Reporter Bao Chunguang) The more than two thousand cadres of the directly subordinate organs of the CCP Yancheng Prefectural Committee, the Yancheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and the Yancheng County directly subordinate organs, relying on their own labor, have opened up a government agency farm with 582 mu of fields on barren land, closely integrating government agency work with labor production, mental labor with physical labor, exercising cadres, improving work, consolidating and developing the achievements of the rectification movement, and creating a new form of cultivating government agency cadres who are both red and expert through labor practice.

This agency farm, more than 500 mu in size, used to be a long-abandoned saline-alkali land, which has now been completely changed after the continuous hard work of the agency cadres. They widened the water diversion river, dug irrigation main canals and crisscrossing branch canals, turning the uneven wasteland into flat and orderly fertile fields. The farm grows all the main crops within the prefecture. At present, all kinds of crops are growing very well.

In this field, you can see Party secretaries, ministers, bureau directors, section chiefs, division chiefs... everywhere. In the fields, there are both old cadres who have been tempered by revolutionary wars and intellectuals who have rarely come into contact with reality in the past. They are all either barefoot or wearing straw sandals, their arms and legs tanned black. Except for a few elderly and frail cadres, the general cadres work in the morning and work in the afternoon, or work during the day and work at night. During the busy farming season, they "work in the fields and work at the edge of the fields," drafting documents, issuing instructions, receiving and sending documents, and holding meetings, etc., which are handled at the edge of the fields during breaks or gaps in time. Labor not only did not affect the work, but also improved work efficiency and cultivated a vigorous and resolute work style.

Cadres relying on their own strength to engage in farming in a real way began in May of this year. Last year, the cadres of the CCP Yancheng Prefectural Committee and the Prefectural Office often organized themselves to participate in voluntary labor in the countryside, strengthening their labor viewpoint. However, voluntary labor remained in the form of temporary and rush work, requiring notification, mobilization, and supervision before labor, and no responsibility after labor, which could not fully mobilize the enthusiasm and consciousness of cadres to participate in labor. In February of this year, the agency cadres and the suburban agricultural cooperatives were linked together to jointly cultivate experimental fields with the peasants, further strengthening their ties with the masses and increasing their production knowledge. However, the joint cultivation of experimental fields with peasants was relatively dispersed, labor was not frequent, ideological leadership and technical guidance were difficult, and evaluation was also inconvenient, making it difficult to draw a complete set of experiences to guide agricultural production in the entire prefecture. In order to make up for the above shortcomings, the Prefectural Committee adopted the method of running agency farms to organize cadres to participate in labor production. The Prefectural Committee is determined to make this farm a university for cultivating agency cadres who are both red and expert, and a strong base for guiding agricultural production in the entire prefecture.

After more than three months of practice, it has been proved that this form of organizing cadre labor has many benefits. First, it has rapidly changed the ideological style of the cadres and further eliminated bureaucracy. The idea of ​​belittling labor has been initially overcome, and the individualism of calculating welfare and pursuing enjoyment has no room to stand, replaced by a new atmosphere of "everyone loves labor and talks about production everywhere." Second, the production knowledge of the cadres has been rapidly improved, thereby improving the work. There are no more cadres who "cannot distinguish the five grains," and the cadres who had engaged in production in the past also feel that they have learned a lot of new things, such as close planting, deep plowing, shallow water frequent irrigation, etc., which were unknown in the past. Third, it has strengthened the relationship between superiors and subordinates and enhanced unity. In the past, the main leading cadres of the agency had few opportunities to be together with the general cadres, but now they often work together with hundreds of cadres, talking and laughing, fully reflecting the equal relationship between superiors and subordinates. Fourth, through production practice, right-leaning conservative ideas have been effectively overcome.

　　机关办农场好处无穷
    盐城创造培养干部的新形式
    据新华社南京27日电　记者鲍春光报道：中共江苏盐城地委、盐城专署直属机关和盐城县直属机关干部二千多人，依靠自己的劳动，在荒地上开辟了一个五百八十二亩田的机关农场，把机关工作和劳动生产、脑力劳动和体力劳动紧密地结合起来，锻炼了干部，改进了工作，巩固和发展了整风运动的成果，创造了通过劳动实践培养机关干部又红又专的新形式。
    这块五百多亩大的机关农场，过去是一块多年荒废着的盐碱地，经过机关干部的连续苦战，现在已根本改变面貌。他们拓宽了引水河，开挖了灌溉总渠和纵横交错的支渠，使凹凸不平的荒地变成了平坦整齐的良田。农场里种植着专区范围内所有的主要农作物。目前各种作物长得都很好。
    在这块田里，党委书记、部长、局长、处长、科长……，到处可见。田里既有久经革命战火锻炼的老干部，也有过去很少接触实际的知识分子。他们都赤着脚或是穿着草鞋，两支胳膊和两条腿都晒得黑黝黝的。除了个别年老体弱的干部以外，一般干部都是上午劳动，下午工作，或是白天劳动，晚上工作。到了农忙时，他们就“地里劳动，田头工作”，拟文、批示、收发文件、召开会议等，在田头利用休息或空隙时间就处理了。劳动不仅没有影响工作，而且提高了工作效率，养成了雷厉风行的工作作风。
    干部依靠自己的力量真刀真枪地大搞农场，是从今年五月开始的。去年，中共盐城地委、专区机关干部就经常组织起来到农村去参加义务劳动，加强了劳动观点。但是义务劳动停留在临时的、突击的形式上，劳动前要通知，动员督促，劳动后又没有责任在身，这就不能充分发挥干部参加劳动的积极性和自觉性。今年二月，机关干部和城郊农业社挂钩，同农民合种试验田，进一步密切联系了群众，生产知识也有所增长。但是，同农民合种试验田比较分散，劳动不经常，思想领导上和技术指导上都感到困难，评比也不方便，难以得出指导全专区农业生产的整套经验。为了弥补上述缺陷，地委采取办机关农场的方式组织干部参加劳动生产。地委决心要使这块农场成为培养又红又专的机关干部的大学校，成为指导全专区农业生产的坚强基地。
    经过三个多月的实践，证明这种组织干部劳动的形式有很多好处，第一，迅速地改变了干部的思想作风，进一步打掉了官气。轻视劳动的思想初步克服了，计较福利，追求享受的个人主义已经没有立足的余地，代之而起的是“人人爱劳动，处处谈生产”的新风气。第二，干部的生产知识迅速地提高，从而改进了工作，“五谷不分”的干部没有了，过去生产过的干部也感觉学到不少新东西，像密植、深耕、浅水勤灌等知识，都是过去所不知道的。第三，密切了上下级的关系，增强了团结。过去机关主要领导干部和一般干部在一起活动的机会不多，现在经常地和成百的干部在一起劳动，有说有笑，充分体现了上下级之间的平等关系。第四，通过生产实践，有效地克服了右倾保守思想。
