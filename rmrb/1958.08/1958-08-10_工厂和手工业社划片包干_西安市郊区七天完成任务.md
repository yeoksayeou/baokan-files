Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th: Agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Xi'an City achieved ball-bearing implementation on all farm tools in seven days. More than 14,000 pieces of rotating farm equipment have been fitted with ball bearings.

The realization of ball-bearing implementation in the suburbs of Xi'an City relied on the mobilization of the entire Party and the adoption of a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. On the evening of July 28, after the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference, the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee put forward the slogan "Fight for seven days to install ball bearings on all improved rotating farm tools in the suburbs," and decided that factories and handicraft cooperatives should be assigned responsibility to complete the task on schedule. The work of manufacturing and installing ball bearings immediately unfolded rapidly throughout the suburbs.

Employees from relevant factories and handicraft cooperatives in Xi'an City immediately joined the movement. Xi'an No. 2 Machinery Factory extracted two machine tools and more than 20 workers to specialize in the production of ball bearings. Xi'an Fire Equipment Factory and Hardware Factory transferred more than 200 workers to the suburbs to install ball bearings for farmers door-to-door. Employees also worked with farmers to find ways to manufacture ball bearings. Liu Zhijie, director of a cooperative in Lianhu District, displayed more than ten kinds of tools that needed to be installed with ball bearings in front of all the cooperative members, mobilizing everyone to come up with ideas. Wang Zhixing, head of the repair and assembly team of an iron factory, immediately manufactured upper and lower grooving tools and a chaff cutter for cutting ball bearing material, allowing one person to manufacture more than 200 ball bearings from iron bars in a single day.

The realization of ball-bearing implementation in the suburbs of Xi'an City is equivalent to increasing nearly 20,000 units of labor and animal power. (Attached picture)

    工厂和手工业社划片包干
    西安市郊区七天完成任务
    据新华社西安9日电　西安市郊区农业社在七天内实现滚珠轴承化。一万四千多件运转农具全部安装上了滚珠轴承。
    西安市郊区实现滚珠轴承化，是依靠全党动员，并且采用了土、洋结合的方法。7月28日晚，中共陕西省委召开电话会议后，西安市委会提出“奋战七天，使郊区一切运转改良农具都安装上滚珠轴承”的号召，并决定各工厂和手工业社划片包干，按期完成任务。制造和安装滚珠轴承的工作立即在全郊区迅速展开。
    西安市有关各厂和手工业社职工都立即卷入这个运动。西安第二机械厂抽出两台机床和二十多个工人，专门生产滚珠轴承。西安市消防器材厂和五金厂抽调二百多名工人到郊区，上门为农民安装滚珠轴承。职工还和农民一起想办法，制造滚珠轴承。莲湖区一社主任刘志杰把十多种需要安装滚珠的工具摆在全体社员面前，发动大家出主意想办法。铁工厂修配股长王志兴即制造出上、下对窝工具和切珠豆的铡刀，一天一人用铁条能制造两百多个滚珠。
