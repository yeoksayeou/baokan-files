Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Commercial departments in various regions are actively preparing to meet the heavy task of agricultural product procurement following this year's bumper agricultural harvest.

Due to the great leap forward in agricultural production, in addition to the unprecedented bumper harvest of grain this year, it is expected that economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco will also increase significantly compared to last year. To adapt to this situation, commercial departments in various regions have carried out a series of preparatory work in acquisition methods and processing, storage, transportation, and other links. Many regions have first strengthened the ideological education of cadres, repeatedly emphasizing that the policy of quick acquisition, more acquisition, and sufficient acquisition must be resolutely implemented for the unified purchase and unified acquisition of materials such as cotton, tobacco, and hemp. They criticized the idea of a few people being afraid of stockpiling and being unable to store them, and therefore not daring to acquire more. They also timely corrected some conservative ideas that underestimated the potential for increased production of economic crops, and required all procurement departments to prepare for everything with the highest level of production increase in mind.

In terms of acquisition methods, in order to adapt to the busy agricultural production and the shortage of rural labor, this year, various regions will change the past acquisition method of "waiting for goods to come to the door," and will generally adopt the acquisition method of sending purchasing agents and graders to agricultural cooperatives for on-site inspection, on-site acquisition, on-site processing, and on-site storage. By adopting this acquisition method, agricultural cooperatives not only do not need to send people to transport agricultural products for sale over long distances, but also after the state acquires the materials, it can temporarily hand them over to the agricultural cooperatives for safekeeping, and then gradually transfer them out in a planned manner, which also solves the difficulties of insufficient state warehouses and excessive concentration of transportation capacity. In order to solve the warehouses needed for on-site storage by agricultural cooperatives, the state has recently allocated more than 25.25 million yuan to assist agricultural cooperatives in establishing a number of simple warehouses through the method of public-private partnership. Some regions are also preparing to promote the "credit sales" method in some agricultural cooperatives with strong political and ideological leadership and good technical conditions. For the acquisition of wild starch and oil crops that have a short maturity period and require seizing the opportunity to pick, they are prepared to organize long-term or temporary professional teams to fully mobilize the masses to carry out shock picking and acquisition. The implementation of the above-mentioned mass line acquisition methods requires imparting grading technology to the masses for them to master. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are actively training graders. Henan Province alone has trained 400,000 people, and Jiangsu Province has trained more than 40,000 people.

Various regions have also vigorously launched a technical innovation movement in the agricultural product processing sector in order to fully tap the potential of existing equipment and better complete the task of agricultural product processing.

Also, the Tianjin commercial workers held a leap forward oath-taking meeting, determined to be a good "logistics department," to carry out large-scale purchases and sales, and continue to fully support the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production.

In the next four months, Tianjin's commercial departments will continue to implement the policy of purchasing as much as industrial production produces, and are determined to take over all the purchase and sale of industrial products. At the same time, they will continue to understand market needs, assist industrial departments in improving production, and ensure that production and sales are aligned to better meet the needs of consumers.

The primary task of supporting industrial production at present is to support the industrial "drought resistance" movement, continue to vigorously recycle waste products, and ensure that nearly 60,000 tons of waste steel, scrap copper and other metals are purchased in the second half of the year, equivalent to six times the same period last year, to supply industrial departments as raw materials.

In terms of supporting the leap forward in agricultural production, commercial units have proposed that the central task at present is to assist rural areas in Hebei Province to realize the ball bearing of all operating tools as soon as possible.

According to Xinhua News Agency, commercial departments in Shaanxi Province are cooperating with the agricultural tool reform movement to vigorously improve the supply of production materials.

In the first half of the year, although the production materials supplied by the commercial departments in Shaanxi Province exceeded last year, they still could not meet the needs, especially the supply of some machine tools and steel raw materials. The Provincial Department of Commerce instructed grassroots units in various places to strengthen the supply of relevant production materials. They adopted the following measures: First, organize large and small factories and mines throughout the province that can produce production materials, use existing equipment, tap production potential, and rationally arrange the production of production materials.

Second, according to needs and possibilities, commercial departments will help industrial departments or agricultural cooperatives to run some small-scale smelting, machinery, agricultural tool and hardware factories.

Third, mobilize the masses throughout the province to collect waste products as raw materials.

Fourth, the commercial departments of each county will immediately assist the local area in establishing agricultural tool reform experimental factories. It is planned that the province will establish a total of one hundred agricultural tool reform experimental factories this year. More than 20 counties in Guanzhong have established 64 experimental research institutions on the basis of agricultural tool manufacturing plants, and have begun to investigate and study. Assist in promoting the inventions and creations of the masses in various places in improving agricultural tools.

### 丰收年景更需大购大销　各地商业部门积极加强收购、加工、保管、供应、运输等环节

　　丰收年景更需大购大销
　　各地商业部门积极加强收购、加工、保管、供应、运输等环节
　  据新华社9日讯　各地商业部门正在积极进行准备迎接今年农业大丰收以后繁重的农产品采购任务。
    由于农业生产大跃进，今年除粮食获得空前丰收以外，棉、麻、烟等经济作物预计也将比去年大大增产。为适应这一情况，各地商业部门在收购方法和加工、保管、运输等环节都进行了一系列的准备工作，不少地区首先加强了干部思想教育工作，反复强调了对棉、烟、麻等统购和统一收购物资必须坚决贯彻快收、多收、收足的方针，批判了少数人怕积压、怕无法保管而不敢多收的思想，并且及时纠正了一些对经济作物的增产潜力估计不足的保守思想，要求所有的采购部门从最高的增产水平着眼作好一切准备工作。
    在收购方法上，为了适应农业生产繁忙、农村劳动力不足的情况，今年各地将改变过去“等货上门”的收购方法，而普遍采取派采购员、验级员到农业社就社验级、就社收购、就社加工、就社保管的收购方法，采取这种收购方法，农业社不但不需要派人远途运送农产品去出售，而且国家在收购到物资后，可以暂时交给农业社代为保管，以后陆续有计划地调运出去，也就解决了国家仓库不够和运输力过分集中的困难。为了解决农业社就地保管所需要的仓库，国家最近已拨出二千五百多万元，以民办公助的办法协助农业社建立一批简易仓库。有些地区还准备在一部分政治思想领导较强，技术条件较好的农业社推行“信用交售”的办法，对于一些成熟期短、需要抓紧时机采摘的野生淀粉、油料的收购则准备组织长期或临时的专业队，充分发动群众进行突击采摘和收购。实行以上这几种群众路线的收购方法，都需要把验级技术传授给群众为群众掌握，因此各地农业社已在积极训练验级人员，仅河南一省就训练了四十万人，江苏省训练四万多人。
    各地还大力开展了农产品加工部门的技术革新运动，以便充分挖掘现有设备潜力更好地完成农产品加工任务。
    又讯　天津商业职工举行跃进誓师大会，坚决当好“后勤部”，开展大购大销，继续全力支持工农业生产飞跃发展。
    天津市商业部门在今后四个多月中将继续贯彻执行工业生产多少就收购多少的方针，决心把工业产品的购销全部包下来，同时不断了解市场需要，协助工业部门改进生产，作到产销对路，更好地满足消费者的需要。
    当前支持工业生产的首要任务是支援工业“抗旱”运动，继续大张旗鼓地回收废品，保证下半年收购废钢铁、杂铜等金属近六万吨，相当于去年同期的六倍，供应工业部门作原料。
    在支持农业生产跃进方面，各商业单位提出当前的中心任务是协助河北省农村尽快地实现一切运转工具滚珠轴承化。
    据新华社讯　陕西省商业部门配合农具改革运动，大力改进生产资料的供应工作。
    上半年，陕西省商业部门供应的生产资料虽然超过去年，但是还不能满足需要，特别是对一些机器工具和钢铁原料的供应。省商业厅指示各地基层单位加强有关生产资料的供应。他们采取以下措施：第一、组织全省能够生产生产资料的大小厂矿，利用现有设备，挖掘生产潜力，合理安排生产资料的生产。
    第二、根据需要和可能，由商业部门帮助工业部门或农业社，举办一些小型冶炼、机械、农具和五金等工厂。
    第三、在全省范围内发动群众搜集废品作原料。
    第四、各县商业部门立即协助当地建立农具改革试验厂，计划全省在今年内共建立一百个农具改革试验厂。关中二十多县已在农具制造厂的基础上，成立了六十四个试验研究机构，开始着手调查研究工作。协助推广各地群众在改良农具方面的发明创造。
