Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch: According to Western news agencies, the portion of the Arab nations' proposal passed by the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Session regarding the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan was modified during the finalization process, at the request of the delegations from three Latin American countries: Mexico, Venezuela, and Ecuador.

The original wording of the Arab nations' proposal concerning the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan stipulated, "...thereby making the early withdrawal of foreign troops from these two countries possible." At the request of the Mexican, Venezuelan, and Ecuadorian delegations, this sentence in the finalized proposal was changed to, "...thereby facilitating the early withdrawal of foreign troops from these two countries." Their request for modification was to avoid the perception that they agreed the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan was legitimate, and to ensure the UN resolution took a more affirmative stance on the withdrawal of US and British troops. Sources revealed that these Latin American countries feared that if they acknowledged the US and British intervention in Lebanon and Jordan as legitimate, the United States might use the same pretext to invade their countries in the future. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), these three countries believed that the phrasing "thereby making the early withdrawal of foreign troops from these two countries possible" implied recognition of the legitimacy of the US and British dispatch of troops to Lebanon and Jordan, whereas the revised phrasing "thereby facilitating the early withdrawal of foreign troops from these two countries" no longer carried that implication. AFP quoted Western semanticists as saying that the phrase "making...possible" indicated that certain conditions had to be created before US and British troops could withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, while the phrase "facilitating" implied that US and British troops should withdraw regardless.

This fact vividly demonstrates the failure of Dulles' efforts to court and threaten the Latin American delegations, attempting to control them entirely.

An AFP report on August 14th stated, "The United States must rely on the Latin American bloc to pass any proposal, and this bloc, in a secret meeting, decided in principle to oppose any proposal that in any way justifies armed intervention in a United Nations member state." To force all Latin American countries to support the US position, Dulles held a secret meeting with the delegations of these countries on August 19th for over an hour. During the meeting, he threatened that the proposal India intended to put forward, which demanded the early withdrawal of US and British troops, was "completely unacceptable to the United States."

However, Dulles' conspiracy did not succeed. Under the pressure of world public opinion, the United States had to accept the proposal stipulating that it "early" withdraw its invading troops from Lebanon. Of particular significance is that it was precisely three Latin American countries from America's "backyard" that requested the modification of the proposal on the withdrawal issue. As Argentina's "Times" stated, the attitude displayed by Latin American countries at this UN General Assembly meeting "is a new fact, because in the past, the United States was accustomed to relying on the almost unanimous vote of the so-called Latin American bloc." It pointed out, "The reason put forward by the Latin American countries, which are no longer obedient, is both simple and extremely significant: Since we ourselves suffer from the scourge of US intervention, we do not intend to support its intervention in other countries."

### 拉丁美洲国家不再听话了  提出修正案不让美国钻空子

　　拉丁美洲国家不再听话了
    提出修正案不让美国钻空子
    据新华社22日讯　据西方通讯社报道，联合国大会紧急会议通过的阿拉伯国家提案中关于美英从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军部分，在最后定稿时曾经作了一处修改，这是墨西哥、委内瑞拉和厄瓜多尔三个拉丁美洲国家代表团要求修改的。
    阿拉伯国家提案中关于美英从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军问题部分原来规定，“……从而使外国军队早日撤出这两个国家成为可能”。经过墨西哥、委内瑞拉和厄瓜多尔的代表团的要求，提案定稿中的这一句改为“……从而便于外国军队早日撤出这两个国家”。它们要求修改，是为了避免认为它们同意美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦是合法的，并且要联合国的决议在对美英撤军问题上采取更肯定的态度。消息透露，这些拉丁美洲国家害怕，如果承认美英干涉黎巴嫩和约旦是合法的，那么，将来美国也可能以同样的借口侵略它们的国家。据法新社透露，这三个国家认为，“从而使外国军队早日撤出这两个国家成为可能”这样的措辞，含有承认美英出兵黎巴嫩和约旦的合法性的意思，而改为“从而便于外国军队早日撤出这两个国家”之后，就不再有这种意思。法新社援引西方字义学家的话说，“从而使……成为可能”的提法表示：在美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦之前必须创造某些条件，而“从而便于”的提法的含意则是：不管怎么样，美英军队都要撤退。
    这个事实生动地表明，杜勒斯竭力对拉丁美洲国家代表团施展拉拢和威胁想把它们全部牵着鼻子走的企图是失败了。
    法新社8月14日报道，“美国要使任何提案获得通过必须依靠拉丁美洲集团，而这个集团在一次秘密会议上决定，在原则上反对以任何方式证明对一个联合国会员国的武装干涉是正当的提案”，杜勒斯为了迫使所有拉丁美洲国家支持美国态度，曾经在8月19日同这些国家的代表团举行了一个多小时的秘密会谈。他在会上威胁说，印度打算提出的要求美英早日撤军的提案“完全不能为美国所接受”。
    但是杜勒斯的阴谋没有得逞，在世界舆论压力下，美国还是不得不接受了规定它“早日”把侵略军撤出黎巴嫩的提案。特别有意义的是，在撤军问题上要求修改提案的正是美国“后院”的三个拉丁美洲国家。正如阿根廷“时报”所说，这次联大会议上拉丁美洲国家表现的态度“是一个新事实，因为在以往，美国惯于依靠所谓拉丁美洲集团的几乎是一致的赞成票”。它指出，“不再听话的拉丁美洲国家提出的理由是既简单而又极有意义的：既然我们自己受到美国干涉的祸害，我们就不打算支持它对别国的干涉。”
