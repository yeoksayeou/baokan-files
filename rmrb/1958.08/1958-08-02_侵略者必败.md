    Aggressors Are Bound to Fail
    Bao Erhan, President of the Sino-Arab United Republic Friendship Association
    On July 14th, the heroic Iraqi people, under the leadership of General Qasim, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty, the running dog of US-British imperialism, and established the Republic. This is not only a victory for the Iraqi people, but also a great victory for all Arab people. This victory will also greatly encourage the anti-colonialist struggles of oppressed people all over the world. Peace-loving people all over the world are cheering for this momentous victory.
    The Iraqi revolution was indeed a fatal blow to imperialism. The backbone of the Baghdad Pact, which was deeply hated by the people of the Middle East, was broken. However, the imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. After the victory of the Iraqi revolution, the US-British aggressors sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, and armed threats against the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic. History proves that any armed intervention and conspiracy by imperialism cannot hinder the heroic struggle of the awakened Arab people for their national independence and liberation. With the firm support of the Soviet and Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world, the fighting spirit of the Arab people will be even more vigorous, and the US-British aggressors will suffer a more shameful defeat than the Suez Canal incident.
    Two years ago, when we visited countries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, we personally witnessed the great anger of the Arab people, who had suffered cruel oppression from imperialism, towards the imperialists. We felt that the imperialists and their lackeys were sitting on an erupting volcano, and one day this volcano would erupt, and the raging fire of anti-colonialism would burn imperialism and its running dogs to ashes. Sure enough, with a thunderclap, the Iraqi revolution, which imperialism considered to be under its most solid control, was successful. The reactionary rulers met with a disgraceful end.
    We also personally experienced the Arab people's love for socialist countries and for the Chinese people. When we were in Jordan, at a banquet, the former Minister of Agricultural Economics gave a speech to welcome us, saying: "The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Now that the People's China has appeared in the east, and the national liberation movements of various countries have developed, while the aggression policies of Western countries are declining. We people of the Orient should strengthen our unity with each other..." These words still seem to ring in my ears. His words show that the people of the Arab East also see that the world situation today is that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind. The various absurd rumors about the "communist threat" spread by imperialism among the broad masses of Arab people have found no market. The people of the Middle East have learned from their own experiences that the socialist camp is their loyal friend and a selfless helper in their liberation struggle.
    Today, US-British imperialism is actively preparing to expand its aggression in the Middle East. In order to quickly stop this situation and disperse this cloud over humanity, the Soviet government has put forward a positive proposal to convene a summit meeting of the five major powers, which has already won the deep support of peace-loving people all over the world and has become a powerful force. Imperialism has fallen into unprecedented isolation in front of the people of the world, and its deceptive and dirty face has been completely exposed to the people of the world. The Soviet Union, the Chinese people, and peace-loving countries and people all over the world firmly support the just struggle of the Arab people, which is an important factor that imperialism will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in the Middle East. If US-British imperialism dares to continue its adventurism and provoke war in the Middle East, then without a doubt, they will definitely play with fire and burn themselves, and suffer even greater defeats.
    The Chinese people have long suffered from imperialist aggression and the oppression of imperialist agents. Therefore, we are particularly sympathetic to the Arab people's just struggle for national independence and liberation. Our 600 million Chinese people stand with them, along with all progressive and peace-loving people in the world. We warmly congratulate the birth of the young Republic of Iraq. We sincerely wish all the Arab people, relying on all patriotic and progressive forces, strengthening unity and cooperation among Arab countries, shattering the imperialist divisive conspiracies, and achieving greater victories in the common struggle against imperialism and for the defense of national independence.
    We resolutely demand that US-British imperialism immediately withdraw its aggressive armed forces from Lebanon and Jordan. We wish the heroic Arab people more brilliant victories and a happy and free life in their struggle for national independence!

    侵略者必败
    中国阿拉伯联合共和国友好协会会长　包尔汉
    7月14日，英雄的伊拉克人民在卡塞姆将军领导下，推翻了美英帝国主义的走狗费萨尔王朝的反动统治，建立了共和国。这不仅是伊拉克人民的胜利，而且也是全体阿拉伯人民的伟大胜利。这个胜利也将大大鼓舞全世界被压迫人民的反殖民主义的斗争。全世界爱好和平的人民为这一重大的胜利欢呼。
    伊拉克革命对于帝国主义的确是一个致命打击。为中东人民所深恶痛绝的巴格达条约的脊骨被打断了。可是，帝国主义不甘心它们的失败。在伊拉克革命胜利后，美英侵略者派遣军队侵入黎巴嫩、约旦，武装威胁伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国。历史证明，帝国主义的任何武装干涉和阴谋活动，都不能阻挠觉醒了的阿拉伯人民为争取自己民族独立解放而进行英勇斗争。在苏联和中国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的坚决支持下，阿拉伯人民的斗志将更加昂扬高涨，美英侵略者必将遭到比苏伊士运河事件更为可耻的失败。
    在两年前，我们到埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦等国访问的时候，曾亲眼看到饱受帝国主义残酷压迫的阿拉伯人民对帝国主义者是怀着多么大的愤怒。我们感到帝国主义及其走卒们是坐在一座即将爆发的火山上，总有一天，这个火山将要爆发，反殖民主义的熊熊烈火将把帝国主义和它的走狗烧得粉身碎骨。果然，霹雳一声，帝国主义认为自己统治最巩固的伊拉克革命成功了。反动统治者遭到了可耻的下场。
    我们也亲身体会到，阿拉伯人民对社会主义国家、对中国人民的热爱。我们在约旦的时候，有一次在宴会上，前任农业经济部长为欢迎我们致词说：“太阳出自东方，落在西方，现在东方出现了人民中国，各国的民族解放运动也发展了，而西方国家的侵略政策则正在没落。我们东方的人们应该加强我们互相间的团结……”这一段话现在好像还响在我的耳边。他的话表明阿拉伯东方的人们也看到了今天的世界局势是东风已经压倒了西风。帝国主义在广大阿拉伯人民中间散布的关于“共产主义威胁”的各种无稽谰言已经找不到市场了。中近东人民从自身经历中已经认识到社会主义阵营是他们的忠实朋友，是他们解放斗争的无私援助者。
    今天美英帝国主义正在积极准备在中近东扩大侵略。苏联政府为了迅速制止这一局势，驱散人类头上的这一片乌云，提出了召开五国政府首脑会议的积极建议，这已经获得了全世界爱好和平的人民深切的拥护而变为强大的力量。帝国主义已经在全世界人民面前陷于空前孤立，他们骗人的肮脏的嘴脸已在全世界人民面前暴露无遗。苏联、中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的国家与人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，是帝国主义必将在中近东遭到可耻的失败的一个重要因素。如果美英帝国主义胆敢继续冒险，在中东挑起战火，那么毫无疑问，它们必定会玩火自焚，遭到更大的失败。
    中国人民过去曾长期受到帝国主义的侵略和帝国主义的代理人的压迫。因此，我们格外同情阿拉伯人民为争取民族独立解放的正义斗争。我们中国六亿人民和全世界进步的、爱好和平的人民一道都和他们站在一起。我们热烈祝贺年轻的伊拉克共和国的诞生。我们衷心预祝全体阿拉伯人民依靠所有的爱国和进步力量，加强阿拉伯国家相互间的团结合作，粉碎帝国主义的分裂阴谋活动，在反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立的共同斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    我们坚决地要求美英帝国主义迅速由黎巴嫩、约旦撤走它们的侵略武装力量。我们预祝英雄的阿拉伯人民在争取民族独立的斗争中获得更为光辉的胜利和幸福自由的生活！
