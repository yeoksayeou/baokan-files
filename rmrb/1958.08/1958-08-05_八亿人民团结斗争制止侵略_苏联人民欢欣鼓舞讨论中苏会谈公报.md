Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 4th – The meeting between Mao Zedong and Khrushchev and their joint communiqué has become the focus of attention for the Soviet people, who unanimously and wholeheartedly support the results of their talks.

"Pravda," the only central newspaper published in the Soviet Union on Mondays, today printed the Sino-Soviet communiqué from Mao Zedong and Khrushchev's meeting on the front page, along with a photo of the two leaders shaking hands while signing the communiqué. "Pravda" also published news about this historic meeting. Moscow Radio has broadcast the communiqué repeatedly since yesterday morning.

After hearing the news of this historically significant meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, the people all over the Soviet Union were very jubilant and discussed it enthusiastically. Chaihov, a worker at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Moscow, said during the discussion that the Chinese and Soviet people are brothers, and the friendship between the two peoples is constantly strengthening. Today, when American and British imperialists are carrying out armed aggression in the Middle East, China and the Soviet Union are jointly and firmly opposing the warmongers and defending world peace. Worker Mozhorov said that the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union issued a serious warning to the imperialist aggressors.

Bubanov, a steelworker in Donbass, said that this communiqué points out how the Chinese and Soviet people are united in the struggle for peace. Let the American and British aggressors know that the strength of peace-loving people is endless, and the peace camp is invincible.

Workers, peasants, and intellectuals in Latvia unanimously pointed out that this meeting made a great contribution to strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the two peoples. Collective farm members in Uzbekistan paid close attention to the broadcasts. After listening to the communiqué, members of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Tashkent region immediately began a heated discussion. The farm chairman Abuzalov said during the discussion that the two great powers, the Soviet Union and China, have consistently pursued a policy of peace, and they are receiving increasing support and sympathy from the people of all countries. However, the imperialist groups headed by the American monopoly groups are continuing to conclude aggressive military-political alliances, establishing networks of military bases around the world, and are increasingly rudely interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The aggressive actions of the United States and Britain in the Middle East are iron proof. He said that we fully support the just demand put forward in the communiqué that the United States and Britain must immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

This newspaper Moscow, August 4th -- After the publication of the communiqué of the meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Khrushchev here, factories in Moscow and suburban farms held seminars and discussions. People unanimously expressed their warm support, believing that this is a further development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet relations in the new situation and new conditions, and that it is a major blow to the American and British aggressors who launched aggression and war adventures in the Middle East.

The famous Soviet scientist Academician Barkin said that all scholars of the Soviet Academy of Sciences warmly support the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and China. We hope that all countries will take all effective measures to stop aggression and ease international tensions. Yegorychev, secretary of the Bauman District Committee in Moscow, said that this communiqué accurately reflects the interests and desires of the people of the Soviet Union and China. The communiqué of the meeting between our two countries’ leaders once again issued a serious warning to the imperialist aggressors.

Isayev, a worker at the Markov Textile Factory in Moscow, said that the communiqué of the meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and China is of great significance in the current international situation. The governments of our two countries have once again told the imperialist aggressors that if they dare to launch a war, they will bring about their own destruction. Voroskulyn, director of the installation workshop at the Ordzhonikidze Factory in Moscow, said that the Soviet and Chinese people will absolutely not allow the American and British aggressors to do their despicable deeds in the world.

Pishalnikov, an agronomist at the "In Memory of Ilyich" Collective Farm, said that the Soviet people are proud to have such a great friend in the Chinese people. The American and British imperialists who are carrying out crazy aggression in the Middle East should remember that there are still such great forces as the Soviet and Chinese people in the world. Let them always remember that the Soviet and Chinese people will spare no effort to defend world peace. Kruppov, a combine harvester at this farm, also said that the ideas of our two peoples are the same: "Prevent war with our labor." The friendship between our two peoples is harder than steel, and the strength of this friendship is greater than any atomic or hydrogen bomb.
