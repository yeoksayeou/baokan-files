    County Head and Sheep Herder
    On August 2nd, in heavy rain, over 1,300 sheep from Yanzhang Township, Changzi County, Shanxi Province, were being driven from the left bank of the Qin River to the right. After more than 300 sheep had crossed, a flash flood suddenly erupted, and the river water rose sharply. Nearly a thousand sheep trapped on the high shoal in the middle of the river were in imminent danger of being washed away. At this moment, the sheep herder rushed to the Qin Yuan County People's Committee to call for help. Deputy County Head Zhang Youfu immediately put down his meal and led over a hundred cadres and civilians to the riverbank. Everyone pulled, dragged, and carried the lambs. They worked from dusk until late at night, finally rescuing all the sheep.
    County head and sheep herder – in some people's minds, these are two vastly different concepts. However, looking at the report above, what difference is there between them besides their different positions?

    县长和羊工
    8月2日，下着大雨，山西长子县燕章乡的一千三百多只绵羊，正由沁河左岸渡往右岸。渡过三百多只后，突然山洪暴发，河水大涨。被水围困在河心高滩上的近千只绵羊，眼看就要被冲走。这时羊工慌忙赶到沁源县人委会呼救。副县长张有福当即丢下饭碗，率领干部和群众百余人奔向河边，大家拖的拖，拉的拉，抱羊羔的抱羊羔，从傍晚直忙至深夜，终将绵羊全部救出。
    县长和羊工，在有些人的脑海中这是多么悬殊的两个概念，可是，看看上面的报道，他们之间除了职务的不同，还有什么差别呢？
