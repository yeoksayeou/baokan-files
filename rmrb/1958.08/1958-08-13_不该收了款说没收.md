　　Shouldn't Claim Payment Was Not Received After Collecting It
    Our company urgently needs a photoelectric automatic balance. Because it's not available in Tianjin, we sent a purchasing agent to the Beijing Scientific Instrument Store to buy it. At the time, it was agreed that the goods would be delivered after the payment was remitted. Subsequently, our company remitted 1,622 yuan on June 10th. Unexpectedly, in mid-June, late June, and early July, our company sent people to pick up the goods and inquire about it three times. They all said that they had not received the payment. It wasn't until July 11th, after we checked with the relevant bank, proving that the payment had been transferred to them as early as June 13th, that they hurriedly searched internally. As a result, the remittance slip was found in the safe, but the photoelectric automatic balance had already sold out, leaving us dumbfounded!
    This store has made accounting errors more than once. On July 5th, we remitted 11,300 yuan to them to purchase a high-temperature furnace. On the 11th, when we went to pick up the goods, they again said that the remittance had not been received. Later, after verification, it was proved that they had lost the remittance slip transferred from the bank.
    Now, everyone is in the Great Leap Forward. The accounting staff of the Beijing Scientific Instrument Store are still so careless. This is not right. We hope they take effective measures to prevent similar errors from continuing to occur.

### 不该收了款说没收

　　不该收了款说没收
    我公司急需一种电光自动天秤，因为天津没有，便派采购员到北京科学仪器商店去买。当时说好，货款汇到以后就交货。接着，我公司在6月10日汇去一千六百二十二元，不料到6月中旬、下旬和7月上旬，我公司先后三次派人前去取货和查询，他们都说没有收到货款。直到7月11日，经我们向有关银行查对，证明这项货款早在6月13日就转给他们了，他们才急忙在内部查找。结果，汇款单据从保险柜里找到了，可是电光自动天秤已经卖光了，使我们哭笑不得！
    这个商店在账目手续上的错误已经不止一次了。7月5日，我们给他们汇去一万一千三百元购买高温炉。11日，我们去取货时，他们又说汇款没有收到，后来经过查对，证明是他们把银行转来的汇款单遗失了。
    现在，全民都在大跃进。北京科学仪器商店的财会人员却还这样马虎。这是不应该的。我们希望他们采取有效措施，防止类似的错误继续发生。
