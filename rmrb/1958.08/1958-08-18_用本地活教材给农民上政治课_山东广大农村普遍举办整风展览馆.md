　　(Our correspondent Zhu Yuemei reports:) In the widespread rural areas of Shandong Province, during the nationwide rectification movement, most townships and communes have established rectification exhibition halls, utilizing this lively form to conduct regular political and ideological education among the masses.

　　Rectification exhibition halls are a good form of mass self-education, a living textbook for educating peasants about the two roads and inspiring the Great Leap Forward. While carrying out the nationwide rectification movement, various localities mobilized and organized the broad masses of township and commune cadres and the masses to post up big-character posters from the airing of views, the situation before and after liberation in the local area, and before and after collectivization, long-term plans, as well as good people and good deeds, bad people and bad deeds, in the form of comic strips, charts, and physical objects, and organized the broad masses to visit; some even had the parties involved act as guides, speaking from their own experiences. At the same time, the exhibition halls are constantly adding new content in conjunction with new political tasks as the rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward deepen. In this way, the exhibition hall has achieved very good results.

　　Now, some places have almost achieved a rectification exhibition hall in every township. According to preliminary statistics from fifteen counties in the Liaocheng Special District, including De County, Liaocheng, Shouzhang, and Shen County, by the end of June, 1,243 rectification exhibition halls had been established, basically achieving an exhibition hall in every township.

　　Because rectification exhibition halls use forms that are popular with the masses to specifically and vividly promote the general line to the masses and to promote the superiority of the socialist system, they have become an effective method and good form for mobilizing and organizing the masses to actively participate in rectification, consolidate the results of rectification, and boost the enthusiasm of the masses. The 1,243 exhibition halls in the Liaocheng Special District are rich in content, realistic, and vivid, and are generally welcomed by the masses. In the exhibition hall of the Beishunhe Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Liaocheng County, many big-character posters, charts, comic strips, and physical objects were displayed. Among the 112 charts and comic strips, there were comparisons of the production and life of the masses before and after liberation and before and after collectivization in this cooperative, the deeds of the young "Liu Jiemei," the changes in the ideological style of cadres before and after rectification, examples of love and lack of care for public property, the sabotage of collectivization by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and comparisons of various new and old agricultural tools. Many of the narrators in the exhibition hall speak from their own experience, explaining things themselves, making self-criticisms while carrying out accounting comparisons to the masses. Because the form is lively and vivid, the masses said after visiting the rectification exhibition hall that seeing it is better than reading books for ten years. Some said that using this method of rectification has many advantages: first, it is accurate; second, it is clear; third, it is fast to learn; and fourth, the education is profound.

　　"Visiting the exhibition hall greatly expands thinking, new atmosphere everywhere, five airs are completely swept away, three evils are eliminated, enthusiasm breaks through the sky, everyone compares to be advanced, each strives to be a model, production leaps forward, cotton and grain piled up like mountains." This poem is a praise of the exhibition hall by an audience member named Wang Huimin. It vividly reflects the new atmosphere after rectification and the role of the rectification exhibition hall. After visiting the exhibition hall, the masses can see clearly who is right and wrong, who is advanced and who is backward, and thus they are even more motivated to learn from the advanced and strive to move upwards. The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Fushan County further strengthened the confidence of the members in taking the road of collectivization and established the collectivist ideology of loving the commune as one's home by organizing the members to visit and debate, which promoted various tasks. After seeing the exhibition, many members of the cooperative wrote letters of determination and challenge, and launched a competition to compare and catch up with the advanced; Song Bingqi, a member in his fifties, said: "This exhibition hall should have been set up earlier, otherwise some people would have simply forgotten how their lives got better." After seeing the deeds of Zhang Zhenyue, who forgot his roots after being liberated, the members of the Beishunhe Agricultural Cooperative unanimously agreed that he was a person who did not know happiness when he was in happiness, and was lost in capitalist ideology after forgetting his roots. After visiting the exhibition hall, the attendance rate of the members of this cooperative has been greatly improved. When the members of the Bali Village in Xin County heard Zhang Da'ai, a 55-year-old woman, introduce her tragic situation of begging for a living in the past at the exhibition hall, it caused many people to have sore noses and tears; when they saw her new clothes, new quilt, and happy life now, everyone was very happy again. The members said that capitalism is a dead end, socialism is a bright road, the small-peasant economy is prone to poverty and bankruptcy, and collectivization is a paradise of happiness. After seeing the long-term plan of the commune, the members of the Taiqian Commune in Shouzhang County were full of energy, and they put forward the slogan: "Go all out and strive to be upstream, take three steps as two steps, finish two days of farm work in one day, strive for a yield of two thousand catties per mu, and never give up until the goal is achieved!"

    用本地活教材给农民上政治课
　　山东广大农村普遍举办整风展览馆
    本报讯　记者朱曰梅报道：山东省广大农村在全民整风运动中，大部分乡社都创办了整风展览馆，利用这种生动活泼的形式向群众进行经常的政治思想教育。
    整风展览馆是一种群众自我教育的好形式，它是向农民进行两条道路教育和鼓舞大跃进的一本活教材。各地在开展全民性整风的同时，发动和组织广大乡、社干部及群众，把鸣放中的大字报，把当地解放前后、合作化前后的情况，把远景规划，以及好人好事、坏人坏事，通过连环画、图表、实物等形式张贴出来，组织广大群众参观；有的还由当事人自己作说明员，现身说法。同时，展览馆还随着整风运动和大跃进的深入发展，结合新的政治任务，不断增加新的内容。这样，就使展览馆收到了非常良好的效果。
    现在，有些地方差不多作到了乡乡都有整风展览馆。根据聊城专区的德县、聊城、寿张、莘县十五个县到6月底的初步统计，已办起整风展览馆一千二百四十三处，基本上达到乡乡都有展览馆。
    由于整风展览馆运用了群众喜闻乐见的形式，向群众具体生动地宣传总路线，宣传社会主义制度优越性，因此它就成为发动和组织群众积极参加整风、巩固整风成果、鼓舞群众干劲的有效方法和良好形式。聊城专区一千二百四十三处展览馆，内容丰富、逼真生动，普遍受到群众欢迎。在聊城县城关镇北顺河农业社的展览馆里，展出了许多大字报、图表、连环画和实物。在一百一十二幅图表和连环画中，有这个社解放前后、合作化前后群众生产和生活的对比情况，有小“刘介梅”的事迹，有整风前后干部思想作风转变的情况，有爱护公共财产和不爱护公共财产的实例对比，有地主、富农、反革命、坏分子破坏合作化的情况，还有各种新式农具和旧式农具的对比。展览馆中的讲解员有许多是现身说法，自事自讲，他们一面向群众进行算账对比，一面作自我检讨。由于形式生动活泼，群众参观后说，看了整风展览馆，胜读十年书。有的说，运用这个办法整风好处很多：一是看的准，二是听的清，三是学的快，四是受教育深刻。
    “参观展览馆，思想大开展，到处新气象，五气全扫完，三害都除掉，干劲冲破天，人人比先进，个个争模范，生产大跃进，棉粮堆如山”。这首诗是一位名叫王惠民的观众对展览馆的歌颂。它生动地反映了整风后的新气象和整风展览馆的作用。群众参观展览馆以后，对于谁是谁非，谁先进谁落后，看得清清楚楚，因而更加鼓足了干劲，向先进学习、力争上游。福山县红星农业社通过组织社员参观、辩论，进一步坚定了社员们走合作化道路的信心，树立了爱社如家的集体主义思想，推动了各项工作。这个社不少社员看了展览以后写了决心书、挑战书，展开了比先进、赶先进的竞赛；五十多岁的社员宋炳歧说：“早该办这个展览馆，不的话有些人简直都忘记了他的生活是怎么好起来的。”北顺河农业社社员们看了翻身忘本回头的张振月的事迹以后，一致认为，他是人在福中不知福，翻身忘本被资本主义思想迷了窍。这个社的社员们参观以后，劳动出勤率已大大提高。莘县八里庄的社员在展览馆里听到五十五岁的老大娘张大爱介绍她过去讨饭求生的悲惨情景时，引起很多人鼻酸泪下；在看到她现在的新衣、新被和幸福生活时，大家又都非常高兴。社员们说，资本主义是死路一条，社会主义是光明大道，小农经济易于贫困破产，合作化是美满幸福的乐园。寿张县台前社的社员看了社的远景规划以后，个个干劲十足，他们提出口号：“鼓足干劲争上游，三步并成两步走，两天农活一天完，力争亩产双千斤，不达目的不罢休！”
