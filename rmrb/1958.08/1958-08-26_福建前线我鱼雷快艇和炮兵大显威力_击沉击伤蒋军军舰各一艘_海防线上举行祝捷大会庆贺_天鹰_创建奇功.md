Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 25th - The People's Liberation Army Navy torpedo boat units and artillery units sank and damaged two Chiang Kai-shek warships reinforcing Kinmen on the 24th.

At 3:18 PM on the 24th, Chiang Kai-shek's artillery, entrenched on Kinmen Island, suddenly and frantically bombarded our coastal islands such as Dadeng Island, Weitou, and Huzai Mountain, covering Chiang Kai-shek's "Zhong" class warships, which were reinforcing Kinmen from Taiwan, as they entered Kinmen's Liaoluo Bay. Our heroic artillery immediately suppressed the Chiang Kai-shek artillery with fierce artillery fire. Coastal artillery also shelled Chiang Kai-shek's "Zhong" class warships and another Chiang Kai-shek "Zhong" class warship that had been hit by us on the 23rd and was still stranded in Liaoluo Bay. The artillery battle lasted for about half an hour, with thick smoke and fire rising from two or three places on the Chiang Kai-shek positions on Kinmen Island. The "Zhong" class warships transporting the troops of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, at 5:33 PM, were hit by our coastal artillery fire and fled south in a panic along with another damaged "Zhong" class warship. Our swift and brave torpedo boat units immediately intercepted the enemy ships, damaging one of them and destroying another "Zhong" class warship that had been damaged by us on the 23rd, sinking it into the turbulent sea.
