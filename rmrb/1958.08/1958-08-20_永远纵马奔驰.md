　　Forever Galloping Onward

    Before reading this short article, please take a look at the cartoon on the side:
    In this cartoon, a "Early Rice Bumper Harvest" grain bin stands tall. Leaning against the grain bin is a person, holding a horse's rein. Looking at the horse's spirit, it's eager to try and doesn't want to stop here, but the person lazily wants to "rest right here!"
    Naturally, because this is a cartoon, there's bound to be some artistic exaggeration. However, the image depicted in this cartoon is indeed a reflection of a certain kind of thinking. Reports on the field rectification movement in Zhejiang Province specifically criticized those who, with a mindset of "double the yield of early rice, halve the work effort," demand to "dismount and rest." They think this way because they believe that the per-mu yield of early rice has already reached 800 jin, and late rice is purely "extra income," "take it if you get it, discard it if you don't," so why be "overly nervous"? With that mindset, the "dismounting theory" naturally comes into being.
    It should be fully acknowledged that some comrades who advocate "dismounting," before they dismounted, also galloped and bravely leapt forward. Specifically, they made certain contributions in achieving the goal of 800 jin per mu of early rice. However, when they prepare to "dismount" or have already "dismounted," it means they are about to stop moving forward. Therefore, we should awaken them from the "dismounting theory," so that they remount and continue to leap forward.
    All proponents of the "dismounting theory" share a common misconception: they believe that after a great leap forward, many of the goals to be achieved have already been reached or even exceeded, and now it's time to "dismount and rest." It is true that for some specific goals, they have indeed been reached or even far exceeded. It is precisely because of this that our socialist construction cause can develop at high speed. However, as far as the entire socialist construction cause is concerned, our current achievements are only a starting point, requiring us to make even greater efforts. How can we "dismount"? As for our highest ideal—communism—our current achievements are only the starting point of the starting point, requiring even greater efforts. Of course, we cannot "dismount."
    Therefore, not only should we not "dismount" now, but we should not "dismount" in the future either. Our future is bright, and our happiness is boundless. Let us mount the socialist steed and gallop forward forever.

　　永远纵马奔驰
　　乐于时
    在未读这篇短文之前，请先看看旁边的一幅漫画：
    在这幅漫画上，高高地树立着一个“早稻丰收”的粮囤，粮囤旁边斜靠着一个人，他手中拉着一匹马。看马的神气，跃跃欲试地不愿在这里停止，但人却懒洋洋地要“就在这里歇歇吧！”
    自然，因为这是漫画，里面免不了有点艺术上的夸张。但是，这幅漫画所描绘的形象却是确实存在的一种思想。浙江省开展田头整风运动的报道中，就具体地批判了这种“产量翻一番，干劲减一半”而要求“下马歇歇”的人。这些人所以如此，因为他们认为早稻的亩产量已经达到八百斤了，晚稻完全是“外快”，“有就收、没就丢”，何必“过分紧张”呢。这样一来，“下马论”的思想自然就应运而生了。
    完全应当承认，一些主张“下马”的同志，在他未下马以前，他也曾经奔腾驰骋，勇敢地向前跃进。具体说来，在实现早稻亩产八百斤的计划中，他们也曾做过一定的贡献。可是，当他们准备“下马”或已经“下马”的时候，那就表示他将要停止前进了，所以，我们应当从“下马论”中将他们唤醒，使他们重新上马，继续跃进。
    一切“下马论”者，都有一个共同的错觉，他们认为：经过一番大跃进，许多所要达到的目标都已经达到或已经超过了，现在应当“下马歇歇”了。不错，就某些具体目标来说，确实是达到了甚至是远远地超过了。正是因为这样，我们的社会主义建设事业才可以高速度地向前发展。可是，就整个社会主义建设事业来说，我们现在的一些成就，只是一个起点，正需要我们做更大的努力，怎么能够“下马”呢？就我们的最高理想——共产主义来说，我们现在的一些成就，只是起点的起点，更需要做更大的努力，当然更不能“下马”。
    所以，不仅现在不应“下马”，就是将来也不应“下马”，我们前程远大，幸福无边，让我们跨上社会主义的骏马，永远向前奔驰。
